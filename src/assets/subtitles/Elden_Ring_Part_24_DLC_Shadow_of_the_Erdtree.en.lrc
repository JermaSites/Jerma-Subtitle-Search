[ve:60.16.100]

[00:50.97]Hey, what's up, you fucking goadfroids?
[00:53.76]What's going on?
[01:03.50]Yeah, we're on day three of Elden Ring DLC.
[01:13.49]What an adventure it's been so far.
[01:19.76]Yeah, just for one day only, that's right.
[01:22.72]For three days in a row only.
[01:29.84]What level am I?
[01:30.52]157?
[01:30.86]158?
[01:31.32]This is just like the olden days when you were in your prime.
[01:50.51]Yeah, the good old days.
[01:51.99]Here's the doctor pepper.
[02:03.65]I wasn't here last game.
[02:04.51]Could you restart it?
[02:10.40]Restart this stream that yeah, that makes sense to me.
[02:18.28]You have a full beard now.
[02:20.40]No.
[02:22.08]It's kind of just there.
[02:25.78]I get into these modes where I just.
[02:28.96]I don't get a haircut and I don't shave for a little while and I just go.
[02:33.45]That's just the way it is.
[02:36.05]I will say having longer hair.
[02:40.95]I don't love the the maintenance.
[02:48.08]Because sometimes those of you with short hair, a lot of people with short hair, right?
[02:53.68]If you take a shower, a lot of times you can get away with just running your head under hot water with the shampoo and say that's it.
[03:03.67]And maybe a little bit of conditioner or something.
[03:05.03]But it's a process to take care of this.
[03:09.08]And it takes forever to dry.
[03:12.27]And it says, I got out of the shower.
[03:14.35]Okay.
[03:14.75]Dry my hair.
[03:15.33]It's like, no, that's it's going to take an hour and a half to two hours before your hair is not wet anymore.
[03:24.83]And yeah, and then the wet hair that somebody just said on the back of your neck.
[03:28.65]As much as I don't, I'm probably going to cut it soon because it's getting so hot.
[03:33.81]It is 100 plus degrees here every day now, at least the last few weeks here in Vegas.
[03:38.44]So I'm like, it's just it's just too hot to have hair this long right now.
[03:55.50]And I sweat too.
[03:57.12]I'm a sweater.
[03:59.34]So I gotta do what I can.
[04:04.18]But yeah, I'll give you the plan for today and the next few days or whatever.
[04:09.24]I think this will probably be the last Elden Ring DLC stream.
[04:13.12]I think I'm getting what I want out of it on the stream.
[04:17.94]I'm having fun playing, doing some stuff.
[04:20.19]Today I'm going to probably explore a lot more than I did yesterday.
[04:24.35]But I think I want to just take it slow in my off, you know, off stream and everything.
[04:30.64]But we go again.
[04:32.82]Three days only.
[04:37.76]Well, here's the thing.
[04:38.80]I'm starting to see it's probably going to take a long time to go through the DLC.
[04:44.25]And I really didn't think or plan that I was going to stream for like, you know, two or three weeks.
[04:49.95]When Elden Ring first came out, I streamed like five days a week for a month straight.
[04:55.19]I was, some of those streams were like 10 hours long too.
[04:58.47]I just not, I don't think I'm going to commit to that.
[05:03.90]But I'm having fun.
[05:06.66]We'll go again today.
[05:16.14]Is it just, this is going to be a 24 hour stream?
[05:19.17]Um, well the number two and the number four are in how long the stream will be.
[05:24.01]There's just a decimal point between the two numbers.
[05:27.81]That's closer to what you could that, you know, 2.4.
[05:37.95]No, we'll go for at least... What did I do?
[05:40.81]Six, seven hours the last few days?
[05:41.96]We'll just go until I'm kind of... I want to just take it easy.
[05:49.24]Also, if this probably... There'll probably be... I don't want to say this, but... Because who knows if it's actually going to happen.
[05:56.03]But I wonder there may be a performance driver update or patch to the game.
[06:02.85]Seems like I'm one of the people that has a lot of performance problems with the game, so...
[06:09.99]it's good it's good enough but there are some times where I'm just like oh I wish I was at 60 FPS buttery silky smooth yeah we'll go today we'll hang out I'm gonna probably go camless just hang out update your nvidia driver I did I have the absolute newest one
[06:35.53]You're also probably noticing that the 1080p has gone away.
[06:39.71]That was, I was doing some testing and it seemed like I got a little bit better, a fraction better performance if I dropped the stream back to 864.
[06:50.04]Yeah.
[06:56.38]Let's go.
[06:57.20]Again, thank you, everybody, for, uh, you know, the, uh, second annual Warstrip and Elden Ring award.
[07:04.45]That's, I, it means, that's very, I appreciate it.
[07:06.85]That sounds, I can't believe it.
[07:08.87]That's amazing.
[07:09.60]I, I don't even know what to say.
[07:14.58]That's so, that's so, uh, thank you.
[07:29.38]Turn off the anti-cheat.
[07:32.94]Yeah, I kind of... I did the whole... I looked up a bunch of... Because I'm using a PS5 controller.
[07:36.92]And I was like, wait a minute.
[07:38.70]And I looked up some stuff.
[07:39.56]People say, no, it's the Steam input.
[07:41.66]Turn that off.
[07:42.34]And I tried that.
[07:43.08]And it didn't really do much for me.
[07:44.98]I tried the... You know, go into windowed full screen mode.
[07:49.53]Go into...
[07:51.47]Make sure there's no browsers open in your other window.
[07:55.33]I think I'm just seeing that it's a CPU bottleneck somewhere.
[07:59.05]And whether that's for optimization of the game and my computer.
[08:04.25]Or maybe I'm just one of those people that has the exact setup that's getting the 30 to 40 FPS drops.
[08:14.00]But it's all good.
[08:14.62]It still is very playable.
[08:16.16]It's cool.
[08:16.42]I'm fine.
[08:21.67]You need more Scudutory Blessings.
[08:24.63]Oh, I know now that.
[08:26.65]I now know that.
[08:27.63]Especially after how hard I was getting hit last time.
[08:36.52]I just don't think it runs well in Appentium 2.
[08:42.28]Well, that shouldn't be a problem for me because I'm on Appentium 3.
[08:45.72]It's a whole generation higher, so I don't know if I agree with you.
[08:50.82]Yeah, let's just get started.
[08:53.52]I am going to be spending a lot more time today.
[08:57.54]This is the exploration stream.
[09:01.48]I think because this might be the last time I... Well, I don't want to say this is the last time I'm going to stream Elden Ring deals.
[09:07.46]I just, I don't know.
[09:08.10]But for the foreseeable future, at least on stream, this is going to be it for now.
[09:15.02]So I don't want to, again, I don't want to set expectations for you.
[09:18.41]But, you know, I'm just going to see how it goes.
[09:22.26]Anyways, let's go.
[09:31.20]It was one day only after all.
[09:32.95]Yeah, it was three days only.
[09:34.29]What's the last thing I did?
[09:48.68]This is my first stream ever watching you with a sad face.
[09:52.86]Oh, no.
[09:53.52]Somebody tell him.
[09:55.08]Do we tell him?
[09:57.17]No, don't.
[09:57.77]Don't.
[09:58.17]Don't tell him.
[10:06.19]Yesterday only.
[10:09.53]What about a multiplayer stream when everyone's finished it?
[10:13.58]I actually think I'm more inclined to do something like that.
[10:16.26]I think that's fun.
[10:16.82]You know, if I do stream this again after this, it probably would be one of those just like goofy fuckface nights where just like, you know, a few weeks from now, it's just like, hey, everybody, let's get together and just like be weirdos for a few hours that I'm more inclined to do that probably.
[10:31.98]When it's like everything's done, everybody knows everything and we can just kind of mess around.
[10:35.56]That sounds kind of fun.
[10:39.19]Alright.
[10:39.81]I will tell you right off the bat, uh, me changing a few settings.
[10:44.27]This actually feels a lot better than it did yesterday.
[10:47.07]I wonder if it looks better.
[10:47.99]It might.
[10:50.02]Alright.
[10:50.32]So here's what I want to do.
[10:51.42]Hey, listen up.
[10:54.40]He said it.
[10:55.10]He just said it.
[10:55.74]Bingo.
[10:56.52]Bingo.
[10:56.90]I got bingo.
[10:57.58]No, you did not.
[10:58.62]Cause bingo resets every stream.
[11:02.18]So buddy, you got one space.
[11:10.17]I want to go this way.
[11:13.31]This is interesting to me.
[11:16.90]This is interesting to me.
[11:19.22]Especially whatever that is.
[11:21.28]It's like button.
[11:24.12]I'm very curious about the button.
[11:26.94]Can I get to the, what killed me here?
[11:29.86]Oh, right.
[11:30.34]When I was running, I was running around testing stuff, just trying to see if I could get the frame rate to be better.
[11:34.61]And I think I just died like 25 times just in the menu.
[11:41.96]It's on my bingo that you make fun of us doing bingo.
[11:45.38]So I got bingo.
[11:46.20]Well, that's two spaces.
[11:49.20]Oh, but what you don't understand is I have you addressing the fact that you're addressing bingo as a bingo.
[11:53.38]So that's three spaces.
[11:55.59]I also have that you're going to address it three times in a row as a space.
[11:58.99]And then I got the free space.
[11:59.99]You get bingo.
[12:00.89]Congratulations.
[12:07.29]Alright.
[12:07.49]So we want to go down here.
[12:08.23]So we're going to go three.
[12:11.60]Ooh, what's this?
[12:12.24]I want to see if I can look at that too.
[12:14.72]3, 4, 2.
[12:16.42]Sounds good to me.
[12:22.40]That just scared the shit out of me.
[12:24.37]Did that scare anybody else?
[12:25.43]Because that scared me.
[12:30.19]Any sound that sounds like that from now on, I am permanently scarred.
[12:35.39]Permanently.
[12:41.11]What's this?
[12:48.24]Sing a song about riding your horse.
[12:51.01]No, what?
[12:54.87]These things have to naturally happen.
[12:57.39]I'm not taking requests right now, okay?
[13:03.28]Me and my horse.
[13:06.00]Jumping and having fun.
[13:15.87]Why are any of you here, by the way?
[13:38.06]Ooh!
[13:40.22]Secret!
[13:47.90]Oh shit, this actually is gonna go all the way down, isn't it?
[13:50.02]Wait, I wanted to come down here.
[13:54.41]We're changing the plan.
[13:56.28]Plan has been changed.
[14:00.28]Sometimes you have to stumble upon something.
[14:02.66]Because I have been trying to figure out how to go down for 14 hours so far playing this game, and I think I finally found out how to go down.
[14:13.37]The DLC is very interesting because the map looks like this, but it's hard to tell if this is 10,000 feet down or 10,000 feet in the air.
[14:25.12]So I'm glad I actually found a way to get down.
[14:36.56]I love this song, too.
[14:38.02]This might be my favorite song in the DLC so far.
[14:40.46]It's just so.
[14:40.84]I don't know, it's like creepy, but.
[14:45.62]Comfy at the same time, but like I love this track, whatever it is.
[14:54.14]Game's a little quiet.
[14:55.79]Actually, you're right, it is.
[14:56.63]Let me turn it up.
[14:58.65]I think I had it turned down at the end when I was talking.
[15:02.67]Turn it up a little.
[15:06.88]Let me know if that gets too loud.
[15:08.16]Whoa.
[15:13.58]Look at that.
[15:14.04]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[15:14.96]Look at how far down that is.
[15:22.70]Oh my goodness.
[15:23.42]Okay, well don't die here because I don't even like remember how I got here.
[15:26.79]I thought I was going to die.
[15:49.36]Excuse me.
[15:55.10]It's time for the flame.
[15:56.34]That move is so good.
[16:04.81]It just kind of hurts my eyes every time I do it.
[16:13.46]This thing has a lot further reach than I thought it did.
[16:21.42]Your FPS may be better, but it looks worse.
[16:26.96]The only setting I changed was I made... I made the... It's just 864 instead of 1080.
[16:35.19]That's the only change that should be on the stream.
[16:40.00]Somebody said, I think it looks better.
[16:43.40]Um... The resolution to the broadcast is the only thing that was changed.
[16:51.79]So, if you were a 1080p enjoyer, I am sorry.
[16:55.83]But... My game is smoother now.
[17:02.67]Your audio sounds choppy?
[17:04.13]It does?
[17:08.82]I didn't change anything else.
[17:15.74]One guy?
[17:16.46]Did I get one guide?
[17:25.16]What's this?
[17:27.82]It's been a while since I've been truly one guide.
[17:30.57]Wow.
[17:33.23]Okay, I got that.
[17:34.53]Let's go down.
[17:40.79]Just Elden Ring Syndrome.
[17:43.69]I don't know if I'm ever going to be on that cliff ever again.
[17:47.59]So if I miss an item up there, I might never get it.
[17:50.68]So you get this syndrome where you're like, wait a minute, what about this corner of this rock in here?
[17:55.24]What's in there?
[17:55.90]Maybe?
[17:56.28]No, I'm never coming back to this corner ever again.
[17:58.30]Nope, see?
[18:07.51]If I had jumped down there, I would never have seen that item ever again.
[18:20.61]I hope there's a Grace down here.
[18:23.29]Shadow realm room.
[18:37.36]I could be on torrent right now, but nah.
[18:40.60]Easier to see stuff on the ground instead of just running around like crazy.
[18:52.05]Brabs.
[18:52.47]Alright, we're gonna Diving R1 this one.
[19:00.93]Check this out, alright?
[19:14.04]Wow.
[19:14.12]Dude, that was so sick.
[19:17.54]I can't believe he nailed it.
[19:32.37]Oh, that's a Mikola thing, isn't it?
[19:37.47]Is that a Mikola thing?
[19:39.65]Something over there.
[19:49.88]Shit, what about over there?
[19:50.95]I think, yeah, I can get there.
[19:52.57]Don't hurt me, please.
[19:58.51]Alright, now this is where we'd be very cautious because I do not want to figure out how to get back down here.
[20:15.52]Pave system.
[20:22.42]I just realized I can't.
[20:24.98]I don't think I can use the staff, that Rinala staff anymore.
[20:30.53]I have all these spells up here that I don't think I can even cast.
[20:36.51]Deep purple lily.
[20:37.83]Because there's Miquella's lily.
[20:44.22]There's Trina's lily.
[20:46.50]Deep purple lily.
[20:47.58]What is this?
[20:52.37]grows in the blue flower field at the coast.
[20:54.73]Like a syrupy poison, its nectar lulls the imbiber into sweet, velvety sleep.
[21:07.16]I love how Elden Ring describes their items the way that I describe my framerate.
[21:13.66]Oh, yeah, man, I can't wait to get that sweet, nectary, buttery framerate.
[21:25.75]It is so weird, though, and this is a problem with technology.
[21:30.80]Those of you that have 120 hertz or more, like 240 hertz, and you run the game at 240 or 120.
[21:38.37]Going back is it changes your it's it's it's too far, right?
[21:44.27]It's like everything looks too good and everything is so smooth that if you go back to like 60 hertz and 60.
[21:49.88]It's just, fuck.
[21:50.82]Why does everything look like shit?
[21:53.28]You don't realize just how fucking privileged we actually are if you have that stuff.
[21:58.85]It's like that, wait a minute.
[22:00.17]Everything's not supposed to be, like, what's, okay.
[22:04.59]Yeah, where's my laminar flow frame rate?
[22:08.02]I'm pissed off about it now.
[22:16.70]Dude's bragging.
[22:18.12]Well, no, my framerate's been pretty dog shit this whole time, so no, I... Skadootree!
[22:23.98]Nope.
[22:28.89]Yes!
[22:29.61]A Grace.
[22:30.33]Thank goodness.
[22:40.69]Dude talked about technology.
[22:42.05]That's a bingo.
[22:47.33]You know, I was thinking about like trying to find one of those like community bingo cards for Elden Ring the last few days and just start the stream, look at the camera and just do every single slot in a row.
[23:04.41]But no, I didn't want to take the fun away from people doing that.
[23:12.03]Alright, wait, I can go this way too.
[23:22.50]Something very... There's yet to be something bad down here until probably right now.
[23:30.95]I just got an auto-save.
[23:32.49]Something bad's in here.
[23:38.22]That's the real poker tell.
[23:40.34]When you see the thing in the top right, that's like, saving, saving, saving.
[23:43.78]Why?
[23:45.62]Why?
[24:02.06]this way.
[24:11.16]Just pretend nobody saw that.
[24:12.16]I was just checking out.
[24:19.10]I thought I saw an item.
[24:20.48]I heard like a twinkle.
[24:21.42]I heard an item's twinkle.
[24:25.53]Yeah, dude, I heard like a ding-da-ring-da-ring.
[24:28.45]I was like, oh, shit.
[24:29.19]There must be a fucking goat froy over there somewhere.
[24:33.82]Yeah, I just had to be sure.
[24:34.84]I got turned around.
[24:40.98]Everything is so pretty and so beautiful.
[24:42.91]It's easy to get turned around.
[24:52.01]Where am I now?
[24:59.61]This is a prime spot for an NPC invader or something is here, right?
[25:04.65]Something's right here.
[25:08.69]This is too open and too weird of a place for there not to be something bad happening right now.
[25:18.23]What's that?
[25:20.62]Round Rock.
[25:25.20]Round piece of rock shaped by the water's current can be used for crafting or simply throwing at enemies.
[25:33.39]Oh.
[25:34.35]My.
[25:35.77]God.
[25:37.53]What?
[25:43.75]You can just throw rocks.
[25:44.83]Did I a few days ago not say this?
[25:48.87]You can just throw rocks at people build.
[25:52.16]No, that's not.
[25:53.10]Don't make me fucking respect my entire character again.
[25:58.76]I need to see what it looks like when I do it.
[26:01.14]Because that's a huge deal.
[26:02.12]If I can just throw rocks at people.
[26:04.38]I'll never win another fight ever again, but... Oh my goodness, that's so stupid.
[26:11.79]I... I'm having a fucking crisis right now.
[26:21.76]I'm actually having a crisis.
[26:25.30]Okay, hold on.
[26:41.42]Or throw rocket guy's head.
[26:44.56]This is hard for me specifically because I will always default to the second one always.
[26:50.65]So this is a crisis actually in the making.
[26:56.45]I've been playing games for a long time.
[26:59.59]You guys have been, some of you have been around for almost 15 years.
[27:03.21]Tell me there has not been a situation where I don't immediately throw the rock at the guy's head or brick or something.
[27:09.04]Ooh, look at this.
[27:21.49]I don't even think it's death down there.
[27:23.23]If you fall.
[27:31.63]Wow, that it was very.
[27:33.13]OK cookbook.
[27:37.82]Hefty you not only can you throw rocks, you can throw a bowl of rocks.
[27:46.89]So you don't just throw the.
[27:49.81]Banana you throw the bunch of bananas.
[27:58.67]That's so goofy.
[28:01.33]I'm curious though.
[28:05.70]Yeah, it really is just a big ball of rocks.
[28:09.56]S scaling.
[28:13.18]Build to the brim with crushed rocks.
[28:22.68]That's a great item to make an entire character around phase through a boss door, throw once, do 200 damage and die instantly and then just quit the game permanently.
[28:31.32]Is that a bird?
[28:40.49]I think it's a bird.
[28:51.11]Weird where am I?
[28:52.27]Oh wait a second.
[28:58.49]Cool, so this is.
[29:00.35]Where I originally at the I think the very first dream I wanted to come to go down here.
[29:04.32]Alright, this probably a cave over here.
[29:07.60]I would imagine, right?
[29:13.40]At least alive if one of them is.
[29:20.53]I'm going to get ganked down here.
[29:38.84]It goes down even more.
[29:45.78]OK, you know when the Dark Souls 1 old map kind of came out and people had the 3D model layering of what it looked like?
[29:54.26]Happens pretty much for all the FromSoftware games.
[29:56.20]I want to see this one eventually after a few weeks of seeing everything.
[30:01.05]I want to see the just the verticality difference between the highest point and lowest point of here, like in this plateau.
[30:05.89]These guys take a lot of hits.
[30:13.78]So what am I using?
[30:14.48]I am using Rellana's Twin Blades.
[30:20.12]It is a remembrance item.
[30:21.60]So sorry, I don't want to spoil that much for you, but this is a boss weapon.
[30:27.57]I won't tell you which one.
[30:42.25]Yeah, but I just showed you the item so you can probably figure it out unless you weren't looking, which don't look.
[30:52.90]Where does this go?
[31:09.04]But wait, that way.
[31:11.04]I can go that way.
[31:12.28]And if I drop down, then I'm not going to get back over there.
[31:19.37]I'm watching you muted with my eyes closed so I don't get spoiled.
[31:23.75]Well, you're doing it wrong.
[31:24.53]You need to don't watch muted.
[31:25.83]Watch it 1% volume.
[31:36.56]You probably can enjoy it that way.
[31:41.39]Just so you'll know when to type Omega Lull in the chat.
[31:43.96]Okay, when you hear at 1% volume... Omega, type it, because you can participate and stuff.
[31:53.74]There's nothing over here.
[31:57.24]See?
[31:58.98]All of us that have our volume up, we are just baiting all the people with their low volume, because... Have you watched this?
[32:04.21]Ready?
[32:04.37]See?
[32:09.47]Look.
[32:12.39]We're catching a lot of people right now that aren't watching the stream.
[32:24.23]It's it's it's interesting because I'm coming I'm kind of coming to terms with the fact that just how weird this stream actually is because if you just jump in here and I know it's like a thing that for years that I've always thought was kind of funny but if you come to this stream and it's like all these people laughing and like fucking omega LOL this is so funny and like you'd be so confused be like what's going why is this happening?
[32:42.64]What's wrong with all these people?
[32:48.79]Another Grace.
[32:49.99]Your Grace.
[33:01.84]um wait a second hold on I do have to make a decision here because can I get from there to alright if I go down because I think there's something over here can I I'm gonna I think I can get there from the waterfall yeah because it looks like something right here
[33:31.52]Yes, there is.
[33:34.80]This goes even deeper and in a different direction.
[33:39.22]Oh no.
[33:40.44]Not a lobster.
[33:44.79]Dude, is that a fucking Maine lobster?
[33:47.09]Oh, that was careful man.
[34:04.55]Should I kill him?
[34:06.13]This is like a boss.
[34:07.17]Okay, yep.
[34:07.73]I gotta kill this thing.
[34:21.32]They do the spit and it's awful because they go boom, boom, boom.
[34:29.01]He's stuck.
[34:36.66]What's he doing?
[34:37.88]What is he attacking?
[34:41.73]Whoa!
[34:42.55]Underneath?
[34:42.93]That's disgusting!
[34:45.93]What was going on under there?
[34:47.21]I think someone ate three of them?
[34:59.23]You just beat the final boss of Maine.
[35:07.01]What would be all the final bosses of all the states?
[35:11.35]Las Vegas would just be a living cigar with a face, legs, and arms.
[35:23.37]Well, actually, no.
[35:24.87]Vegas is a city.
[35:29.35]I still think Nevada would be a cigar that could talk and had like arms and legs.
[35:34.87]And I'm talking like Pickle Rick, but not Pickle Rick.
[35:39.34]Not Pickle Rick, I'm talking the same character style as Pickle Rick.
[35:49.42]Dude, Pickle Rick, what the fuck?
[35:59.44]Oh my God, he said it.
[36:05.14]This place goes deep.
[36:22.09]What are you doing down here?
[36:24.54]This is not safe for you to be down here.
[36:27.10]Oh goodbye.
[36:39.40]This has been a fun little place to kind of traverse around.
[36:41.76]I feel like I may have missed something, but here we are.
[36:46.56]How do you deal with your vices?
[36:53.18]I'm trying to cut all my bad habits, but it's been difficult.
[36:57.07]Um.
[37:01.15]Honestly.
[37:03.70]You just have to kind of set realistic expectations for yourself, honestly.
[37:08.04]If you smoke and you want to stop, don't quit smoking in a day.
[37:12.82]Be realistic about it.
[37:13.64]Make a commitment that you're going to do it for your health or your body or whatever.
[37:20.42]That doesn't mean stop smoking tomorrow.
[37:26.38]It can take a lot.
[37:28.30]Especially if it's something that you enjoy doing.
[37:30.62]It's hard.
[37:38.48]I think a lot of people just think that everything has to happen instantly or immediately.
[37:42.84]No.
[37:43.52]It's a fucking process.
[37:48.36]When you press print, the printer doesn't just... Well, actually, no, that doesn't... Okay, hold on.
[37:53.22]Imagine this conversation is 15 years ago.
[37:56.08]When you press print, you go to, like, file, print.
[37:59.02]Takes a while for that ink to... It doesn't just come out done.
[38:05.02]Even 3D printers, they take fucking 25 minutes to do their thing.
[38:08.56]It doesn't just happen immediately.
[38:13.11]So if you want to quit smoking, just think of this sound.
[38:16.47]Because that happens for about seven minutes before you get your good, like, high color photo.
[38:26.98]What I'm saying is quit smoking in seven minutes.
[38:29.58]And I'm not even reading this.
[38:36.10]I was once told a coffin could convey its passenger upon a gentle cruise.
[38:41.54]The Velvet Garden of deepest purple.
[38:47.08]Oh, to slumber in such a Paradise.
[38:51.11]Uh, we have to get into often and sit there for a minute and then go to a new area.
[39:09.85]Hey, what is that famous quote?
[39:12.03]The famous quote, and it's true.
[39:13.75]It's real.
[39:15.83]You better listen to me.
[39:20.55]Give me the strength to accept the things I cannot change.
[39:25.60]Courage to change the things I can.
[39:28.62]And the wisdom to know the difference.
[39:31.78]Burn that into your brain permanently.
[39:46.41]I didn't make that up.
[39:48.77]So, no, I'm not smart.
[39:50.71]That's just a good quote.
[40:03.05]It's a prayer.
[40:05.09]It's a- Yes, that's- Okay, that's what I mean.
[40:06.89]It's a prayer.
[40:07.95]Okay, like Ben- Ben Franklin didn't say this.
[40:11.07]But he could've.
[40:15.76]Oh yeah, oh yeah, quotes!
[40:17.52]Famous quotes from fucking Edgar Allan Poe or, you know, Mark Twain.
[40:24.21]It's a good prayer.
[40:25.51]It's a great prayer, okay?
[40:26.81]I like this quote.
[40:35.58]Hey, it doesn't matter what the context of my knowledge of what that is.
[40:41.21]It's a good message and it should be shared in perpetuity forever.
[40:56.12]Dude, this keeps going down.
[40:58.56]What the fuck is going on?
[41:02.20]Where the hell am I?
[41:05.92]This is, this key, look at how much further this goes down.
[41:27.21]No wonder I couldn't get here from the beginning of the game.
[41:33.80]It's down into the mantle.
[41:36.80]Not even the crust.
[41:39.02]Uh-oh, I think I'm screwed here.
[41:40.08]Uh-oh.
[41:43.76]Can I get back up there?
[41:48.88]Oh, shit.
[41:50.26]What have I done?
[41:51.62]Wait.
[41:52.82]I can just... The Grace is right there.
[41:54.24]I'm fine.
[41:59.30]Okay, I'm good.
[41:59.78]I'm good.
[42:00.06]I'm good.
[42:05.18]You're going to descend into hell just like Ben Franklin.
[42:07.50]Fuck you.
[42:09.46]Sorry, I didn't mean that.
[42:17.93]OK, can go that way.
[42:29.41]Can I make this jump?
[42:31.47]I might.
[42:31.89]I think I can.
[42:32.45]Let me try this first.
[42:34.01]If I die, I die, whatever.
[42:38.31]The Grace is right there.
[42:54.33]If you ever do another Jerma Rumble, we need a Ben Franklin returning from help.
[43:00.25]How dare you?
[43:02.27]Oh, that was a mod.
[43:02.95]That was Josh.
[43:14.27]OK, I can go across.
[43:22.17]What's that?
[43:27.66]That's very weird.
[43:29.28]I almost want to shoot it with bone arrow.
[43:31.16]Because that's that's strange, right?
[43:33.18]That's very strange that that's there.
[43:42.33]That's strange.
[44:02.75]It's there.
[44:03.11]Okay, good.
[44:03.89]Oh, the thing is... Look, it's glowing.
[44:05.53]It's glowing yellow or orange.
[44:07.97]Ooh, cool.
[44:08.71]I'm so glad I looked at that.
[44:09.73]Ooh.
[44:11.55]Maybe it was worth coming all the way down here after all.
[44:17.55]Go after it.
[44:18.37]No, that's death.
[44:19.86]I need to traverse down.
[44:22.60]Wait.
[44:23.00]Okay.
[44:25.70]Am I dead there?
[44:26.34]No.
[44:26.76]Okay, I'm going to go this way.
[44:31.71]Oh, loot gap.
[44:32.31]That's right.
[44:35.73]There's a purple back there.
[44:45.67]More gold sheep.
[45:02.95]I'm being very cautious because I don't know what could be here.
[45:07.89]Mushroom seller's bell bearing.
[45:12.01]What?
[45:12.55]Is that what that was?
[45:13.31]Oh, no!
[45:16.77]Did the dude fall?
[45:19.42]What happened to this deer?
[45:23.12]Oh, no.
[45:24.46]Did I... I didn't drop the... I didn't drop the fucking anvil on his head, did I?
[45:30.20]No way.
[45:37.89]A new, uh, ball bearing.
[45:41.51]Ball bearing?
[45:43.07]Bell bearing of a horn-set mushroom seller who did not survive the war.
[45:46.27]Offer to the twin maidens husk, okay.
[45:48.55]Toxic mushroom?
[45:54.00]Cool.
[45:54.32]I wish you could see my Subnautica below zero base.
[46:01.08]Uh.
[46:04.32]Sure, it looks cool.
[46:17.59]Alright, I got everything.
[46:18.98]Cool.
[46:21.28]This is now... Gonna get interesting, I think.
[46:36.63]Now where am I?
[46:40.83]Wait.
[46:45.21]Wait a second.
[46:45.97]I'm...
[46:48.39]Where the hell am I?
[46:50.19]Honestly, I'm... This... The church is... Wait, is the church below me?
[46:55.20]Is it above me?
[46:56.52]Am I underneath all that?
[47:04.50]It's all the way up there.
[47:05.86]Cool.
[47:09.88]So this... Oh shit, I'm going this way now.
[47:25.85]I would love a map fragment down here.
[47:27.21]There's one far away.
[47:29.01]I'm going to hug the wall though, because there might be a cave system.
[47:42.42]You never know when there's a cave system.
[47:52.48]What is up with these giant golden sheep?
[48:01.60]Why can I not target this one?
[48:11.17]Wait, this is an NPC.
[48:13.41]Ooh!
[48:20.49]What is that shit?
[48:23.60]Wait, this is the guy that we saw all the way down here, isn't it?
[48:27.60]Didn't I look over the edge and I saw one of these guys doing this?
[48:33.56]And I remember saying, wow, look at how far down that is.
[48:37.89]Or is that a different spot?
[48:42.21]That's kind of crazy.
[48:42.97]What is this?
[48:44.31]A record of crafting techniques left by the non-human forager brood.
[48:49.37]Shared out of the kindness toward Moore and his kin.
[48:53.40]Acquired the knowledge to craft the following lightning-proof pickled liver.
[48:58.22]These are the things from, these are like the kindred, right?
[49:00.92]The rot people?
[49:03.60]How come... Why is it not hostile?
[49:05.12]I don't know.
[49:11.13]Bug people?
[49:14.55]Well then, as an envoy of the bug people, I need to make sure I make my presence.
[49:21.82]Known.
[49:37.14]I... There's no way that that goes all the way down there, right?
[49:41.64]There's no way that there's more to do down there.
[49:44.38]If there is, then I don't... This game is five miles deep.
[49:53.33]And, like, I don't... I don't know.
[50:00.33]Oh!
[50:07.30]Dude is just moving.
[50:11.76]Cruising.
[50:25.75]What is that?
[50:31.03]Is that a gigantic dragon?
[50:37.37]Hold on, where is that on the map?
[50:44.63]It's like here.
[50:47.02]Wait, let's actually find out.
[50:50.82]No, it's further out.
[50:55.27]It's way further out.
[50:56.37]How far away is this?
[51:13.44]That's far.
[51:27.93]Alright, anything else over here?
[51:28.97]Besides the, uh, uh, firl, fulgur blue.
[51:34.21]Fulgur blue.
[51:39.27]I'm not messing with that thing.
[51:40.27]That thing can kill me in one hit.
[51:41.23]Alright, well, looks like I'm just going this way.
[51:46.11]Is that a giant turtle?
[51:56.18]Hello?
[51:57.14]No, no, no, no, no!
[51:57.88]It's a crab!
[51:58.38]That's a crab.
[51:58.78]That's a crab.
[51:59.16]That's a crab.
[52:00.08]That's a crab.
[52:01.05]That looked like a turtle.
[52:02.35]That looked just like a turtle.
[52:09.23]That was a turtle!
[52:14.64]What a reveal!
[52:15.80]That was crazy!
[52:20.80]That, look, that was a turtle.
[52:22.09]That was a stone turtle.
[52:24.73]The neck, it wa- The claw was the neck, and if you go back and look and think of that as a turtle, you're gonna go, holy shit, it is a turtle.
[52:54.54]Shit.
[52:56.76]End of the road.
[52:59.48]No.
[53:02.95]It's not the end of the road, right?
[53:04.25]What about over here?
[53:21.68]This is... Okay, I can go this way.
[53:35.11]Wow.
[53:37.39]Cerulean- Cerulean Coast.
[53:45.72]Very pretty.
[53:48.72]What do you think races smell like?
[53:59.98]Oops.
[54:02.50]It's my control.
[54:08.03]I'm glad that didn't happen at the waterfall.
[54:16.86]I almost wish that happened at the waterfall because that would have been very humorous.
[54:22.77]Just walking right off a cliff because you dropped your controller on the ground.
[54:30.91]Bro, did you sniff your controller?
[54:32.27]No.
[54:36.55]What what does it and is it hot?
[54:39.61]If you're sitting right here, is it warm?
[54:41.55]Is it hot?
[54:43.23]Is it?
[54:44.33]I feel like it would be like static electricity.
[54:46.16]You know that feeling of static electricity in the air.
[54:52.74]It would be hot static electricity.
[54:57.48]Hey, what do you guys think an Estes tastes like?
[55:00.60]I think it tastes, you know, on my real take, I think it tastes just like straight apple cider vinegar.
[55:12.70]People think, oh, maybe it's got like hints of orange.
[55:14.62]No, no, this tastes like just like acid.
[55:30.27]We're not robots, Jerma.
[55:31.33]We can't feel static electricity.
[55:35.08]Raise your hand if you've been able to feel electricity in the air.
[55:38.92]My hand is up right now.
[55:46.15]It's got this weird smell.
[55:48.59]It's very almost... It's almost like... What's wrong with this guy?
[55:53.53]What the fuck?
[55:56.69]Why did I... I did six damage to that guy.
[55:59.23]That's weird.
[56:10.71]Yeah, electricity in the air smells like metal.
[56:14.16]It's like a metallic smell.
[56:15.98]It's a very light, faint metal and energy.
[56:21.84]You can almost like taste the air in a way.
[56:24.14]It's very weird.
[56:27.04]Now, see, ozone to me is different.
[56:30.26]Ozone is similar.
[56:47.46]Map is expanding.
[56:56.46]Did you get the Elden Ring Twitch badge?
[56:59.60]Uh, I don't know.
[57:03.30]I have not looked.
[57:21.57]Yeah, ozone has a very interesting smell.
[57:24.49]It's really not great for you though.
[57:27.19]It's like kind of bad.
[57:28.31]Whoa.
[57:45.18]Why is he smelling ozone?
[57:46.62]I just got here.
[57:47.30]No, we're talking about how when you can sense ozone in the air.
[57:53.34]It has a very distinct feeling.
[57:55.44]Same thing with like electricity.
[57:56.46]I can just kind of tell it's got a vibe.
[58:07.41]Here's the map fragment.
[58:16.59]Another worm friend.
[58:23.97]Southern Shore.
[58:24.79]Okay.
[58:30.13]What the hell?
[58:38.25]I thought this was supposed to be as big as Limgrave.
[58:44.20]Because there's a whole thing up here.
[58:55.25]Cool.
[58:55.79]Alright.
[58:57.79]We're going here.
[59:00.29]Maybe there's a dock that I can go fishing off of.
[59:03.96]Oh, cool.
[59:13.31]We just got Elden Ringed.
[59:14.31]Yeah.
[59:16.27]Technically, it's Limgrave five times on top.
[59:18.23]Whoa, there's a Miquella.
[59:18.95]Oh.
[59:27.12]Scary music is playing.
[59:29.26]For some reason.
[59:42.73]Skidoo tree fragment.
[59:45.39]Nectar blood virgin.
[59:51.13]Let's see.
[59:54.85]Afterwards, I abandon here my doubt and vacillation.
[60:16.43]Oh, wait, I have another blessing to do.
[60:20.47]I need it.
[60:23.06]Okay, this is plus six now.
[60:25.88]I feel like we're getting somewhere with that.
[60:33.70]I think that's the thing I was seeing in the distance, isn't it?
[60:35.45]Let's investigate.
[60:44.47]Can I jump into the clay?
[60:46.63]The blue clay?
[60:53.69]You can?
[60:54.05]Do you just, like, sink in a little?
[61:02.59]Uh-huh.
[61:03.07]Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
[61:04.93]Thanks for the sympathy laughs.
[61:06.22]I appreciate it.
[61:15.70]Oh, I can smell ozone.
[61:21.53]How do I kill this thing?
[61:22.29]Oh.
[61:29.10]We're going right there.
[61:34.75]It's beautiful down here.
[61:47.43]All the way to the beach.
[61:49.71]I made it to the beach.
[61:55.15]Be careful.
[61:56.94]That thing was he was just trying to hurt me.
[62:02.69]Cut it out.
[62:04.79]Quit messing around.
[62:08.31]You got something to say, say it.
[62:09.27]Alright, that's what I thought.
[62:19.06]Now go be cute somewhere.
[62:20.06]Is this death?
[62:30.96]I made 100 of these before the DLC came out.
[62:33.38]Let's at least use one.
[62:37.62]Ooh.
[62:42.34]Oh, it's not these things.
[62:44.96]I have fire though.
[62:45.68]OK, I really I gotta get off the horse for this.
[62:58.71]And we gotta use fire.
[63:04.57]This is one of my least favorite enemies in the whole game.
[63:15.05]That is a slow projectile.
[63:16.57]I forgot I had to do this!
[63:27.88]Holy shit.
[63:29.70]Oh no.
[63:35.00]I'm gonna roll into the other one in a second here.
[64:00.87]This is another one too.
[64:04.13]These things are the absolute worst.
[64:14.32]Okay, another one.
[64:20.60]Not messing around right now.
[64:21.72]Okay.
[64:33.78]I just stopped that grab and I'm so happy about it what the fuck that almost grabbed me
[64:58.98]There we go.
[65:09.83]Guys, I don't think he's messing around right now.
[65:16.45]No, I wasn't.
[65:17.29]You're right.
[65:21.17]I thought this is an item and I got really, really excited because it was yellow.
[65:25.80]I was like, YES!
[65:28.68]I... just... in the past, messed with the future me.
[65:34.43]And I'm not happy about it.
[65:44.19]Pretty.
[65:49.72]How come you got a cape of bacon?
[66:05.20]No, I've got the best rip on Twitch.
[66:18.75]Shit.
[66:38.03]Can I actually, I can walk in this.
[66:43.31]How far can I walk?
[66:48.30]There's the drop right there.
[66:49.22]Alright, how hard would everybody laugh if instead of, oh wow, a huge drop off and it just kept going down like it's been and there's a crazy underwater sea level where there's like a breath mechanic and there's like another mile deep.
[67:10.49]Somebody laughed really hard at that.
[67:11.91]And I think it was ironic.
[67:14.43]I think he was just kind of being like, oh, ha ha ha.
[67:17.15]That was, you laughed really loud.
[67:18.65]That was a lot of ha's in a row.
[67:25.57]What the fuck?
[67:27.96]I don't think I want to fight this thing.
[67:30.32]I'm not confident right now.
[67:31.22]I lost all my confidence.
[67:35.08]What is this?
[67:39.77]a huge altar or something now that is a legendary whatever it is that is that is a legendary great grave glove ward that's just the regular oh plus 10 okay cool I thought it was going to be like the sword of the dragon skin
[68:15.67]Seems like they're putting those a lot because there's a lot more ashes.
[68:19.35]I mean, I used it.
[68:20.09]I have Yoda up to plus 10.
[68:22.71]I like this area, though.
[68:26.04]Grave cricket?
[68:30.28]Cricket that produces a raspy cry.
[68:33.44]The sound of these crickets are often taken to be the rustling of restless dead or sometimes the sound of their calling voices.
[68:42.05]Creepy.
[68:42.29]Anything else I can do here?
[68:53.83]There is more over here.
[68:55.86]Did I fully get all that?
[68:57.76]Did I fully explore over there though?
[69:00.74]Not really.
[69:04.95]What's that?
[69:23.82]Shit, I thought I was smart.
[69:39.18]Okay.
[69:41.42]Fuck.
[69:42.34]What color is that item?
[69:54.24]Okay, goodbye.
[69:55.16]That was fun.
[69:56.56]Remember, it's not circle.
[70:00.82]It's not dodge to fall back.
[70:02.76]You have to go in the menu and actually click the telescope again.
[70:11.31]Actually, I'm not even that upset about that considering I need to go on top of that one.
[70:20.69]You die to that, but not the hand monster.
[70:24.55]See, that's the thing about being absent-minded and being clumsy.
[70:28.46]Yeah, if I'm locked in, I can do a lot.
[70:33.42]But the second that I get a little clumsy, I just walk off of a cliff.
[70:39.16]It's just the way it is.
[70:39.84]Alright, so that one was... Where was that one?
[70:48.43]Right there.
[70:48.79]Okay, so I got to go up here.
[71:09.91]Glovewort.
[71:14.66]Brave Glovewort 9.
[71:17.58]So this is the Glovewort area.
[71:21.10]It looks like there's a shitload of Glovewort just on these.
[71:24.12]What are these?
[71:24.74]Are they like gigantic tombs?
[71:26.26]What is in these?
[71:29.72]Dragons or giants or something?
[71:31.12]These are huge.
[71:32.32]I want to see what this thing is.
[71:34.05]What is actually on the altar?
[71:36.71]What is that?
[71:45.67]Interesting.
[71:56.92]That's the one I was looking at over there, right?
[71:59.70]There's one over here, too.
[72:12.15]That is what a badass.
[72:13.89]Those horns mean that you're badass, right?
[72:25.72]I'm going to get that and then I'll go over.
[72:27.20]I'm going to.
[72:27.48]I want to see if that thing is going to wake up.
[72:30.62]It's going to be insane.
[72:40.51]Yeah, great, brave Glovewort.
[72:42.71]Did they really want you to get your summons to plus 10 if you don't have any?
[72:46.93]Can you buy Glovewort plus 10 or even plus 9?
[72:50.13]I'm not sure you even can.
[73:11.07]Did you beat that boss yesterday?
[73:12.15]Uh, you're talking about the one that I ended the stream on in a rage?
[73:16.43]In an absolute tantrum?
[73:19.07]Uh, do not check the end of the VOD yesterday if you didn't watch the stream.
[73:22.68]It was- I was- I'm embarrassed about it.
[73:24.40]It was- I ended the stream, I like- I said like, screw this game, and I said- and I threw the controller into the ground.
[73:34.45]And it spiked up off the ground and hit me in the face.
[73:36.99]And I have a- like a fucking big black eye and I- it was fucking horrible.
[73:50.48]Um, I think I've... But wait.
[73:53.64]I want to go up to the tip, though.
[73:56.66]Alright.
[73:57.34]Tip or weird dragon thing lying over here?
[74:07.09]Tip or dragon?
[74:08.63]Tip or dragon?
[74:10.71]Dragon.
[74:12.83]I did see a lot of tips, but I want to see what this thing does.
[74:19.83]Well, let's not do that.
[74:20.97]Do it correct.
[74:30.52]I can't wait to walk over there and it goes...
[75:00.36]Okay, let's go.
[75:01.68]Ooh.
[75:10.32]St.
[75:10.64]Trina Disciples Cookbook.
[75:13.46]I actually want to read the lore on this.
[75:17.04]A record of crafting techniques left by a disciple who pursued the teachings of the Saint of Sleep.
[75:23.39]Yet what seemed a gentle sleep at first ripened into velvet.
[75:29.47]Eternal sleep pot.
[75:35.00]Micola.
[75:36.52]St. Trina.
[75:38.22]Sleep.
[75:39.60]St. Trina.
[75:40.38]Sleep.
[75:41.04]Micola.
[75:41.60]There's a lot going on here.
[75:44.58]Eternal sleep?
[75:47.86]It's just death?
[75:49.42]But not death?
[75:51.04]Like, I don't know.
[75:52.42]Kind of like a weird sleep afterlife or something?
[75:55.26]I don't know.
[75:55.56]There's a lot of questions I have at this point.
[76:03.84]I gotta get over there.
[76:22.49]I actually might.
[76:24.64]Go from this Grace.
[76:26.50]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[76:28.48]Because I have to kind of go over.
[76:30.00]Yeah, it's from here probably way easier.
[76:37.92]Kingdom Hearts 43 and 1 4th.
[76:39.24]Yeah, I saw that.
[76:41.30]I saw that recently.
[76:42.74]I saw Kingdom Hearts 2.8 HD Remix Edition.
[76:47.00]And I had the question of how many more times can they release Kingdom Hearts before they get to 3?
[76:53.38]There's room for a 2.9.
[76:54.08]There's a 2.9 potential.
[76:57.96]But they can only... I don't know.
[77:00.78]They can only release the game one more time.
[77:04.81]Because otherwise you're at Kingdom Hearts 3.
[77:10.87]Yeah, and three's already out.
[77:12.35]So if they do 2.9 and then you can't do like three.
[77:16.11]You gotta be 2.95.
[77:23.79]Alright, I need to go down here.
[77:27.61]So.
[77:32.27]Maybe that's not a good way to get there from here.
[77:35.59]Hold on a second.
[77:38.91]Maybe I have to wrap all the way around behind me.
[77:40.79]Let me check over here.
[77:47.65]And it's funny because, okay, Kingdom Hearts 1 was like, it's not 1.8.
[77:50.53]Is it?
[77:50.65]No.
[77:50.73]It's only the 2 is 2.8.
[77:51.63]1 is like 1.6 or something, isn't it?
[78:15.14]I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it, but I'm not sure.
[78:43.43]I thought you did this yesterday?
[78:44.33]There's probably more than one.
[78:49.03]There's probably more than one Great Grave Glovewatch.
[78:51.49]Get out of the fucking way!
[79:16.18]Death Blight.
[79:22.98]Oh shit.
[79:23.68]Death Blight alert.
[79:27.68]I'm quitting the game.
[79:29.04]I've fucked that.
[79:34.82]I quit the game.
[79:36.08]How are you supposed to dodge that?
[79:38.58]I quit the game.
[79:42.86]Hey, what's up guys?
[79:43.59]I'm thinking about taking Elder Ring back up again.
[79:45.27]I feel like I could try again at some point.
[79:49.73]I think I'm taking it up again now.
[79:50.73]Yeah, we'll see if it's better this time that I try.
[79:57.72]Like, starting the game back again.
[79:59.26]After the break I just took.
[80:02.03]So...
[80:06.28]You know what's wicked funny?
[80:07.16]I actually was thinking of quitting the game in Millenia.
[80:11.38]I was like, I'm fucking out of here.
[80:13.28]I'm never playing this fucking game ever again.
[80:18.80]Internally, when I was fighting Millenia, I was like, fuck this game, I'm never playing it again.
[80:23.51]I like internally was thinking that.
[80:25.29]That was what was going on.
[80:26.15]After like attempt number 80 or 70 or whatever, I was like, nah, no, no, that's it.
[80:34.78]We could really tell yeah.
[80:38.60]It's so hard to just just keep like the emotions bottled.
[80:42.65]It's just like God fucking I hate this.
[80:54.82]He's drop a Smithing Stone.
[81:17.41]that was a interesting um okay whatever dude you're wearing pool boy shorts uh no these are naughty these are not shorts man are they yeah they kind of are alright well don't get up in there what are you doing
[81:47.80]I wanted to go see the other dragon and this scared you dragon has got my attention now and I'm annoyed by it.
[81:57.28]I can do it.
[81:57.66]Alright, lock in.
[82:08.80]Jerma, stop being greedy.
[82:11.85]You play your game and I'm going to play how I want.
[82:14.85]I wasn't even being greedy.
[82:15.83]What are you talking about?
[82:18.27]What?
[82:19.86]No, I break that down just while you think I was.
[82:21.58]You know, I do miss cut the tail.
[82:45.24]I do.
[82:45.46]I'm surprised it never came back.
[82:51.19]Did FromSoftware think it was like a little too gimmicky maybe?
[83:15.20]Ooh, we're okay.
[83:31.73]Get off the horse faster than that!
[83:36.68]It's not a pony ride, dude!
[83:38.40]Get up there!
[84:05.30]Shit.
[84:11.19]Shit.
[84:24.74]I just stole that guy's cricket.
[84:26.36]What was he doing with it?
[84:35.51]I don't like this place.
[84:36.21]I don't want to fight him right here.
[84:37.99]Too many things to run into.
[84:38.93]What the fuck are you?
[84:50.00]I thought that was the guy on his hands and knees.
[84:53.66]I thought it was a guy running like a dog, not a dog.
[85:05.94]What?
[85:06.38]Stop this.
[85:08.18]Is he summoning these?
[85:20.85]Get away from me.
[85:21.85]Why is it all of a sudden now everybody is here?
[85:43.65]I'm gonna do a little bit of wacky shit here, I think.
[85:46.05]No, no, no, no.
[85:46.83]Stick with the plan.
[85:47.75]Stick with the plan.
[85:56.67]Low and slow.
[85:58.60]You gotta treat a lot of these bosses in the DLC like you're cooking a fucking pot roast, honestly.
[86:23.90]Are these guys dead, dead, or did they come back, right?
[86:26.04]Oh, that sucks, right?
[86:27.06]You have to hit them more than once.
[86:28.12]I'm alright.
[86:35.86]There are so, my God, there's an entire army here.
[86:39.95]Fuck.
[86:42.83]Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.
[86:46.05]Oh, no.
[86:46.53]Alright.
[86:49.13]Strategy change up time.
[87:07.72]I have to kill these things.
[87:08.80]They're going to get to be so unbearable in a minute.
[87:19.13]I got a level of playing field.
[87:20.63]I just have to.
[87:21.05]Alright, Mambo.
[87:27.65]Go for it.
[87:30.83]Mambo, swing at him.
[87:33.23]He's just standing there.
[87:40.73]He was shocked.
[87:43.27]He's like, why are you summoning me for this?
[87:45.58]I don't want to fight this guy.
[87:48.02]It's me, Otto.
[87:58.14]Okay, yeah, he can take care of those things.
[88:00.59]Let me fight the boss.
[88:08.36]Now it's a fair fight.
[88:21.96]No, Mambo, you were doing so much better when you were over here.
[88:37.71]These guys have so much health.
[88:43.35]I love this guy so much.
[88:46.89]Don't you just feel like he's not even fighting?
[88:48.51]He's just kinda having fun.
[88:49.57]Uh oh.
[88:52.87]Alright, I actually have to be very careful now.
[89:00.71]This is bad.
[89:19.03]I would imagine if you could get on a horse.
[89:29.81]No, I can't go in.
[89:31.17]I'm too afraid.
[89:32.79]He's gonna do that.
[89:33.73]Yep, mom was probably dead here.
[89:37.66]Oh, that's it's deadly Mambo, sorry.
[89:44.36]Doing it again.
[89:46.32]Always not doing it again.
[90:02.56]I have to just play really conservatively.
[90:04.22]I should rot.
[90:06.30]Maybe I should try rotting.
[90:08.49]That's my mistake.
[90:09.17]I have the rot in my other hand.
[90:10.23]I'm not even using it.
[90:10.79]Uh-oh.
[90:23.96]Uh-oh.
[90:32.40]Wee!
[90:33.16]Bad!
[90:33.54]This is bad!
[90:34.82]No!
[90:36.33]Wait, where did I get the... What happened?
[90:38.73]I had two flasks?
[90:39.71]Where'd they come from?
[90:40.47]What?
[90:41.57]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[90:42.25]What the fuck just happened?
[90:44.23]What did I... I didn't even realize... I didn't even know I had those.
[90:48.97]Where did those just come from?
[90:50.03]Where did I just get those?
[90:52.73]Is it because I clear, like, a, quote, like, technically a camp of enemies?
[91:00.52]I didn't even realize that was what just happened.
[91:04.64]Oh, shit.
[91:08.13]I wasn't even looking down there.
[91:09.89]I just automatically assumed I had nothing.
[91:13.87]Okay, well.
[91:17.40]God damn it, you have so much health.
[91:24.78]Different approach.
[91:26.96]Actually new approach.
[91:34.82]I want to see.
[91:35.32]I'm curious how Yoda does against this.
[91:38.66]And I'm also curious of how... I want to rot.
[91:42.37]Let's try rotting.
[91:43.03]I wonder how susceptible...
[92:00.16]Is it on?
[92:00.66]Nope.
[92:02.88]I wonder if they can be rodded.
[92:04.82]It's probably not possible.
[92:18.61]I don't think you can.
[92:19.55]I'm just going to be super aggressive.
[92:25.71]That was a bad idea.
[92:36.78]Oh, I was trying to swing with the left hand because I put it in fucking two hands.
[92:39.55]God damn it.
[92:40.09]Oh.
[93:07.34]Yeah, there we go.
[93:08.00]Got it.
[93:08.90]Alright.
[93:10.47]Now let's go.
[93:40.05]Watch out!
[93:40.65]Watch out!
[93:41.09]Watch out!
[93:41.53]Move!
[93:41.67]You fucking dog!
[93:56.32]Get away from me!
[94:03.60]No, I'm stuck in his leg.
[94:05.07]No, I'm stuck in his wing.
[94:07.55]Come on, dude.
[94:09.17]No.
[94:10.07]That sucked.
[94:12.35]He's doing it again.
[94:13.38]Get the fuck away from me.
[94:38.70]Alright, let's use it.
[94:40.30]Rod again.
[94:40.76]It actually works, and it's actually very helpful.
[94:51.52]Uh-oh.
[95:08.80]You piece of shit with the spear.
[95:11.37]You just ruined everything.
[95:14.69]Sorry about the view, but I gotta run!
[95:25.33]I gotta get the rod on again.
[95:37.53]He just rushed me.
[95:51.09]Come on, Yoda.
[95:52.01]Oh, fuck.
[95:52.93]I'm dead.
[95:55.53]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[95:56.95]Why did I do that?
[95:58.07]I was just... Ow.
[96:00.51]Fuck.
[96:01.86]Why did I do that?
[96:09.07]Do I care too much about the rot?
[96:10.57]I mean, these things have like 500 million HP.
[96:17.78]Is the rot really doing very much?
[96:29.04]Let's get off the horse.
[96:30.62]The problem with staying on the horse, though, is what he does, the death kind of dark flame moves.
[96:37.50]If you're underneath that and you're not out immediately, can you even get out before?
[96:41.64]I think the horse is required to get away.
[96:43.80]I'll try it.
[96:46.82]I'll give it.
[96:50.05]I'll give it a shot.
[96:54.49]Only use the whore.
[96:55.11]You know what?
[96:55.45]Actually, you know what?
[96:56.06]This is probably a good idea too.
[96:59.32]Get it like on the bar so I don't have to do that.
[97:08.14]Flames are not that dangerous.
[97:10.22]I feel like they chunked me so bad.
[97:11.90]Alright, let's do it.
[97:12.46]I'm going to try just a fight the boss, fight the dragon.
[97:15.68]Let's go.
[97:21.33]Great start.
[97:24.78]This is where I need to be doing damage right now and it's a massive shame that I'm not.
[97:28.62]I don't know about this.
[97:33.97]I don't know about this.
[98:22.67]Get away!
[98:23.75]Fuck.
[98:25.91]Oh, fuck.
[98:29.75]Yeah, the rot's taking too long.
[98:35.93]Oh yeah, I don't know about this.
[98:40.05]Oops.
[98:40.31]I was doing so much better on the horse.
[99:02.69]Holy shit.
[99:06.95]Ah, dammit.
[99:08.19]Try to get the stagger again.
[99:25.83]Alright, Yoda.
[99:26.77]Let's see what you can do.
[99:31.42]Y-Yoda, this way!
[99:40.75]No dog, why?
[99:43.23]Why these dogs?
[99:46.73]OK.
[99:48.23]All the little shit enemies that are just littered in this whole area.
[99:52.96]They make this a lot harder than it needs to be.
[99:54.52]Alright.
[100:02.42]I'm coming back later.
[100:05.26]I don't fight this dumb dragon anymore.
[100:11.25]I am going to mark it though.
[100:12.03]You just have too much health.
[100:14.71]You have way too much HP.
[100:17.63]So much so that I'm coming back later and I'm going to throw a lightning bolt into your eyeball and I'm going to kill you in three hits.
[100:25.10]I'm going to get a dragon communion.
[100:26.18]I don't even care about the dragon hearts anyways.
[100:28.74]Alright.
[100:31.07]I want to see the bigger dragon.
[100:32.63]What a great idea.
[100:35.97]Let's forget about the little dragon, and let's go to the huge one that's going to be ten times as difficult.
[100:42.07]Sounds like a good fucking plan to me.
[100:48.22]Right here.
[100:49.58]I do think I have to run by it, though.
[100:50.94]I'm just trying to get my revenge, and it didn't happen.
[101:06.93]Alright, can I actually get up there from here?
[101:09.20]I think I'm just going to end up where I was before.
[101:25.71]Maybe you can't get over there from here.
[101:56.22]So... I might actually have to end up going that way.
[102:01.76]You probably have to get there from... It's hard to tell what's on the map and what's not.
[102:12.45]Let me try wrapping around.
[102:16.95]You go back to the beach?
[102:21.47]I could also go up there.
[102:22.45]I could just see what's over there.
[102:25.99]And then immediately turn around and come back this way.
[102:28.14]I don't think you have enough rot slop on.
[102:32.42]Okay, there's the dragon.
[102:43.10]Hmm.
[102:46.10]Is it shallow enough?
[102:47.14]I think it's shallow enough where I can... Yeah, I think it is.
[102:49.16]Let's test it.
[102:57.21]Nice shot.
[102:57.79]Can we get a Spongebob impression?
[103:03.07]Yeah, sure.
[103:08.46]Hey, it's me Spongebob.
[103:11.00]From the new Spongebob movie.
[103:24.44]What?
[103:29.60]Don't act like that wouldn't be the way it is, potentially.
[103:32.34]If they made another movie.
[103:46.47]Is it?
[103:46.85]It is shallow enough.
[103:48.65]Oh, nice.
[103:49.11]Okay.
[103:49.99]Yep.
[103:50.55]Yep.
[103:50.83]Yep.
[103:51.09]Yep.
[103:51.35]Yep.
[103:51.63]All this.
[103:52.59]That's death.
[103:53.79]This isn't.
[104:00.11]Remember when you did the impression by wiggling your esophagus and you immediately regretted it?
[104:09.74]Oh, I do.
[104:11.28]Okay.
[104:12.74]I am about to see the secrets of the dragon temple, whatever it is.
[104:28.22]Not yet.
[104:31.67]oh look at these like somebody made like a little stone formation somebody put little colored rocks to make like a little like a little sand castle that's cute oh my god it's what the heck it's not even a sand it's a hand what the holy gah
[105:17.24]Alright, here we go.
[105:20.04]Hope there's a Grace over here.
[105:35.18]Love what?
[105:43.02]Who there is a Grace but.
[105:46.69]That dragon has a spike through its head.
[105:51.51]I don't know if that thing's going to get up, but, uh, maybe it is.
[105:57.74]Whoa, this, oh, it's a bunch of fingers.
[106:04.55]Holy shit, this is creepy.
[106:06.85]I want to go down here.
[106:14.54]You've heard of the Two Fingers, you've heard of the Three Fingers, but have you heard of the 100 fingers?
[106:18.70]Cool.
[106:46.30]Why does this have a giant lance through its head?
[106:49.24]I don't know.
[106:49.86]I can't get up there, I don't think.
[106:53.16]Not from here.
[106:58.19]That's pretty crazy, though.
[107:00.45]This is huge.
[107:05.21]Let's go to the Fingerland.
[107:12.72]I'm curious about Fingerland now.
[107:28.54]I already hate this place.
[107:44.31]Thankfully, this weapon is very anti-hand enemy.
[107:48.65]I'm going to put this back on.
[107:55.02]Yeah, here.
[108:01.80]A lot of them, though.
[108:10.74]Are we actually going to see?
[108:11.66]Because remember in the base game, there was a huge finger enemy as a boss, but didn't really have a boss health bar.
[108:17.75]I wonder if there's going to be one down here.
[108:26.23]He's finally playing Glover.
[108:27.73]I remember playing Glover.
[108:35.68]I played Glover and I was like, oh man, yeah, Glover for the N64.
[108:39.38]Let's do it.
[108:39.98]And I was, I think within 10 minutes, I was like, oh, I don't really want to play this.
[108:45.49]What is that?
[108:48.97]Whoa.
[108:51.07]What the fuck is this thing?
[108:52.77]Look at this thing.
[108:55.91]What kind of animal is like a worm?
[108:57.50]It kind of looks like Godwyn, that Godwyn face.
[109:05.90]I want to look at this.
[109:08.52]No!
[109:09.54]It has that Godwyn face.
[109:15.27]Sort of smushed out look with the mouth and the two eyes.
[109:19.19]I want to look at those things up close.
[109:31.17]I just had to see if they were alive.
[109:36.02]All the blue like blue ashes in a way.
[109:46.26]This could be my favorite area so far.
[109:49.93]It's just so interesting looking.
[109:52.99]I love that Gray in the blue.
[109:55.25]But the the hints of the gold.
[110:24.81]The R1 on this is so good.
[110:26.67]Especially for regular enemies.
[110:28.07]Uh-oh.
[110:31.65]Well, let's get it over with.
[110:53.89]What the fuck was that?
[110:55.74]Uh-oh.
[111:02.18]We're gonna do this on the horse.
[111:03.16]Whoa!
[111:09.84]Get that shit away from me.
[111:35.21]No!
[111:36.01]I took like two fall damage and it killed me.
[111:43.79]I had to have done less than two centimeters of fall damage.
[111:49.56]It is the exact amount of HP that I had left.
[111:53.52]Shit.
[111:54.10]Alright.
[111:55.54]Okay.
[111:56.00]Okay.
[111:56.23]Okay.
[111:56.45]Okay.
[111:57.61]Alright.
[111:59.89]I'm going to clear it.
[112:00.57]I'm not going to, I'm going to be very, very precise about this.
[112:21.55]Right in the middle.
[112:22.17]It's kind of a little pyre, isn't it?
[112:39.41]The dirt is like a big fingerprint.
[112:42.27]It is.
[112:46.57]That's weird.
[112:49.69]Did somebody just- a huge crazy giant just squished their finger here and it- all the bacteria from their dirty finger made more fingers?
[113:15.90]I think it's actually just L1 spam, because the fire, you hit, the sword hits, the fire sword will hit first, and they freak out.
[113:23.14]I think I got, I'm doing it wrong by trying to do the weapon art.
[113:26.36]It takes too long, and it's not actually making them do this.
[113:30.56]If I hit one of the big ones, it will do that.
[113:33.48]So I need to just get one good hit on them.
[113:41.98]The chew fingers.
[114:07.63]That's 2,000 damage.
[114:12.38]Okay, let's try this again.
[114:15.40]L1.
[114:17.20]Get a dodge in and just L1.
[114:19.66]One L1 means I kill them pretty much instantly if I just can do L1 spam.
[114:29.52]There's another one that's dropping and I didn't see it, so I think it's over here.
[114:33.09]I'm going to avoid this for now.
[114:35.49]There's another one right here somewhere.
[114:37.33]Yep, there you are.
[114:42.57]I want to pull this one.
[114:44.30]Come on, walk on.
[114:45.30]Don't screw me here.
[114:52.06]There we go.
[115:02.71]Ooh, let's do that.
[115:05.11]There we go.
[115:11.11]That's a cool move.
[115:23.00]There we go.
[115:29.52]No, don't freak out.
[115:32.31]OK, we're good.
[115:32.85]Alright, it's L1 and then the R1 chain.
[115:48.81]It's definitely the way to do it.
[115:56.66]They usually hide another one here too, probably.
[115:59.40]I wouldn't be surprised.
[116:10.77]Making it slow.
[116:15.37]Worst thing you can do in situations like this is rush.
[116:17.79]And I know you really just want to get down there.
[116:19.75]But you have to go slow.
[116:27.08]That's how you make mistakes.
[116:38.86]Wait.
[116:39.12]You're the only one, right?
[116:50.62]Not that effective.
[117:01.51]Staggered.
[117:19.20]Don't even tell me you're gonna swing around me and get me.
[117:32.23]Burn!
[117:36.45]Oh, these guys are so awful.
[117:44.84]How those things get you is they go dudun.
[117:47.48]And then you think they're gonna go dudun immediately after, but you thinking that you roll and then they dudun.
[117:53.49]And then you roll again and then they dudun.
[117:55.93]You have to wait after one dudun, wait a full second, and then the second dudun.
[118:01.10]That's when you dodge.
[118:03.40]I should write guides for this game.
[118:35.38]This one area in Elden Ring scared so many players, Miyazaki was even considering removing it from the game.
[118:48.47]What is this?
[118:58.65]Ah, this is a mausoleum remembrance thing?
[119:08.31]Oh, shit.
[119:09.73]Um... Cool.
[119:22.62]I guess this is how I could get the moons, but I don't think I'm going down that path anymore, though.
[119:31.40]I'm gonna mark this because I don't really necessarily care right now.
[119:35.90]Let's mark it as...
[119:43.25]Something that I will remember.
[119:46.79]Diamond is probably fine, yeah.
[119:52.73]Well, that's cool.
[119:53.33]They have those here.
[119:53.95]Alright, there's a lot.
[119:56.97]What are you doing over here?
[119:57.69]There's a few of you hanging out.
[120:00.69]Oh, the scratching of the... I hate that.
[120:06.59]It's just like...
[120:09.97]It feels too comfortable, right?
[120:13.37]Like that thing's comfortable over there and it's weird.
[120:29.66]Like that is the equivalent of that thing kind of scratching its ass in a way.
[120:53.61]What did I tell you about the Dun?
[120:56.90]Listen to me.
[120:59.60]You see what just happened right there?
[121:13.74]Everything's dead.
[121:15.54]What was even over there?
[121:21.66]Were they just kind of hanging out?
[121:22.61]Was there nothing here?
[121:23.17]I think they were just hanging out.
[121:36.13]I almost just walked off the edge.
[121:49.71]They really weren't guarding anything.
[121:51.09]There had to be something, right?
[121:52.45]Nothing.
[121:57.77]A broken rune is what you all were congregating on?
[122:01.47]Why?
[122:06.15]Well, alright.
[122:07.72]Trying to go back down.
[122:16.62]No fast way to get down there besides this way.
[122:26.23]He actually was just kind of scratching his ass and I just ruined everything.
[122:35.85]OK.
[122:37.31]So this is the way down.
[122:38.91]I'm sure I didn't miss anything.
[122:41.94]Oh.
[122:51.08]Senseless murder.
[122:57.13]Let's get off the horse.
[122:57.79]Get off the horse.
[123:01.29]Why are you being so weird?
[123:08.67]Stop being so weird.
[123:22.48]I love this move.
[123:24.02]Especially if you can catch somebody.
[123:28.41]What are you doing?
[123:33.34]Magical hands?
[123:33.92]I don't like that.
[123:34.38]Kind of look like leeches with arms.
[123:49.44]Yeah they do.
[123:57.11]This is massive down here.
[123:59.69]This is one of the bigger areas in the entire game.
[124:08.50]This actually might be the biggest single area.
[124:13.36]I don't know.
[124:16.15]Is there a place that's bigger than this?
[124:18.05]This is huge.
[124:24.61]Alright, let's go to the perimeter.
[124:32.88]I swear to God, if that dragon rips the spike out of his head and starts breathing fire down here, I'm going to be very, very excited.
[124:39.81]But annoyed at the same time.
[124:58.46]Something terrible is gonna happen down here.
[125:00.00]I am not ready for it.
[125:29.16]They're very long.
[125:32.50]The Redan area might be bigger.
[125:36.12]I don't know.
[125:36.74]Um... Maybe.
[125:43.33]They're actually about the same.
[125:48.61]Well, Redan's is a little bigger, yeah.
[125:49.75]Okay.
[125:59.19]Redan.
[126:07.96]Finger mimic.
[126:13.22]Light pink mushroom resembling a wizened finger.
[126:15.74]Material used for crafting items.
[126:18.43]Used to by those who wish to become fingers to induce hallucinations.
[126:23.77]They call these mushrooms the stillborn of the Two Fingers.
[126:30.99]Wish to become fingers.
[126:36.21]Wait, are the Two Fingers?
[126:38.23]It's like what?
[126:39.93]Six, seven, or eight Two Fingers?
[126:41.34]Are they just people that turned into Two Fingers?
[126:43.98]Should I eat one?
[127:13.85]I feel like this is going to drop.
[127:20.05]Finger mimic.
[127:22.51]It's nothing.
[127:22.97]It's a lot of these imitations of an imitation of a copy of a copy of an imitation of an imitation.
[127:29.26]It's like the Millicent stuff.
[127:35.86]Millicent is, well, you know, spoilers, but hey, it's DLC and you're watching it, so we're way past that point.
[127:44.49]The rot clones, like rot seed people that come out when Millenia does her rot thing.
[127:50.95]It's just like, what the fuck is going on?
[127:52.05]Why are there all these copies and clones of people?
[127:55.44]It's like an imita- and then the Auburnorax.
[127:57.56]Like they're like imitation people that are trying to make people out of like fucking clay.
[128:03.96]Who did this?
[128:09.91]I'm gonna put my volume to 1%.
[128:10.73]Oh, it's alright.
[128:11.71]Well, you'll know when something crazy happens.
[128:32.23]Right on schedule.
[128:38.51]Lake-like stone shard with a faint fingerprint engraving.
[128:41.29]A piece that came loose from the tip of one of the column-like stone fingers that grow at the finger ruins.
[128:48.02]I'm taking my time here because I... I... How many... I want to know... I'm... The Two Fingers are one of the most interesting things to me in the game.
[128:57.48]The concept of the fingers... I feel like we're going to get a lore dump somewhere right here.
[129:05.66]I'm going to get invaded by a finger.
[129:09.53]A two-finger invasion is going to happen.
[129:10.93]It's going to be walking around on two-finger legs.
[129:19.95]And it's going to look like this.
[129:20.73]It's going to look like this, right?
[129:23.66]Like this.
[129:26.98]Oh, I got to get the good view of this.
[129:28.14]Like... You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[129:34.42]When you get invaded by the NPC invaders and you just see that this is what you see.
[129:39.83]I wanna see a Two Fingers do that run at me.
[129:43.08]Like the default NPC run at you run.
[129:47.82]With a big fucking sword in their hand.
[130:04.71]This one's broken.
[130:17.78]Who vandalized the Two Fingers.
[130:21.88]Ouch.
[130:25.78]What has happened?
[130:27.60]Where did he come from?
[130:29.20]What did he do?
[130:30.62]Where did this thing come from?
[130:33.96]Was he in the sky or was I just not paying attention?
[130:45.99]Lamprey.
[130:47.75]That range is unbelievable.
[131:20.29]well here we go I'm still on the ground
[131:41.15]Oh, do you see inside the mouth?
[131:42.63]That was very strange.
[131:57.05]Stop.
[131:58.27]Are you fucking serious?
[132:04.78]Oh.
[132:10.64]It's got my brain sucked out.
[132:15.08]I feel like after that happens, you should kind of be like... I can't even make my funny joke that everybody's gonna... Damn.
[132:28.60]That was seven or eight panic rolls in a row.
[132:32.99]Stop rolling and fucking just heal and fight them.
[132:35.47]They're not even hard.
[132:43.92]Fuck off.
[133:04.61]Don't you dare.
[133:06.27]I know that bullshit you got.
[133:10.70]Alright, I got it off this time so I could redo the Man of Flask.
[133:22.55]I can go that way.
[133:23.33]I'm going to go over there.
[133:28.55]Might as well take a look.
[133:43.97]Their line of sight is monstrous.
[134:04.63]Sounds are falling down.
[134:05.67]I can go that way.
[134:06.35]Um?
[134:12.90]What about a bee farm?
[134:13.76]You seem like the kind of person that would open a bee farm.
[134:17.64]I love bees.
[134:19.16]These are awesome.
[134:25.25]So funny, they're so fuzzy.
[134:30.47]How can something be so?
[134:33.01]Puffy and fuzzy.
[134:45.12]Yeah, you always think of bugs as the carapace.
[134:49.24]Yeah, it's got that carapace, right?
[134:53.66]As everybody thinks.
[134:55.12]There are fuzzy like bears, little like bears of bugs.
[135:01.65]And all they want to do is just like eat dirt.
[135:05.87]And like spread pollen and eat nectar and stuff.
[135:17.98]Sound of insects flying freaks me out.
[135:21.30]Yeah, but you know what else does too?
[135:23.70]A hummingbird.
[135:24.20]There's a lot of hummingbirds out here.
[135:28.10]And when one flies kind of close to you, it sounds like a giant death insect.
[135:33.31]That's like... I think the flapping, the vibration of wings in general is just kind of off-putting.
[135:41.03]It doesn't really matter what it is.
[135:43.24]And again, hummingbirds are amazing.
[135:44.52]I love hummingbirds too.
[135:46.72]But yeah, when you hear a hummingbird near you, you have this kind of knee jerk.
[135:49.90]Just because that sound is so... It just... It comes with a certain kind of power behind it that you're afraid of.
[135:59.97]Because you don't have it.
[136:03.53]Okay, I thought that was bigger.
[136:04.53]I thought it had a huge head.
[136:38.47]What to do?
[136:55.27]Anger mimic.
[137:06.04]These almost look like eggs.
[137:09.56]Fingerprint eggs or something weird.
[137:11.42]I know that's not what it is, but I'm exploring the lore.
[137:23.70]They are eggs.
[137:28.28]Fingerprint eggs?
[137:54.76]Ouch.
[137:55.60]I need stamina.
[138:15.54]What if fingers are aliens?
[138:18.32]I don't know.
[138:18.62]I mean, it's kind of implied that that's what they are.
[138:23.04]Alright, like the greater will, the outer gods.
[138:29.33]It's kind of implied that there's a cosmic angle to everything here.
[138:42.05]The Golden Order.
[138:43.25]The Greater Will.
[138:45.77]The Three Fingers.
[138:46.93]The Frenzied Flame.
[138:48.93]The Formless Mother.
[138:52.23]The Glomide Queen, right?
[138:54.11]There's a whole lot.
[138:56.50]This thing's got nougat in it.
[139:15.38]Honestly, I just like looking around this area.
[139:18.72]It's going to be a big snake or something, isn't it?
[139:20.18]A big finger snake.
[139:22.74]It's going to be a huge index finger that has one of these big snake faces and a tongue sticking out.
[139:31.57]And the move it does is like a crazy move.
[139:34.75]We gotta get all the reactions for it.
[139:37.33]It pushes its finger down and smushes your face and head into the ground.
[139:42.28]And it lets it up.
[139:42.82]And it's you died.
[139:43.68]And you have the Godwyn face.
[139:46.18]Like it smushed, crushed your face into the Godwyn face.
[139:49.54]And that's what it is.
[139:50.20]And that's what Godwyn has become.
[140:00.78]Just being thorough.
[140:15.40]This is the last bit that I didn't look at.
[140:32.30]I do feel like this probably.
[140:33.80]A dungeon here and.
[140:39.26]I thought it was.
[140:39.88]I thought I found one.
[140:47.84]OK.
[140:47.92]I think I've completed my turn all the way around.
[140:58.50]Let's go to the middle and then.
[141:03.20]Looks like I can get through here.
[141:04.18]Alright, remind me to do that because it looks like I can do that.
[141:07.27]Let's go to the middle and see what happens.
[141:20.92]Try finger butthole.
[141:24.83]I have to imagine that if I had the signs on, this place wouldn't even be a ground.
[141:30.21]It would be soap signs with that message as the ground.
[141:40.86]And it would be really hard.
[141:41.94]There would be so much real estate that you wouldn't be able to use.
[141:44.80]People would be desperately trying to find the spot to put it.
[141:47.09]It's like, oh, there's all white soap stones here.
[141:49.77]Hold on.
[141:51.09]I got a spot right here.
[141:56.11]It would be like a tile floor of those.
[141:58.83]Alright, here we go.
[142:05.25]That is interesting looking.
[142:19.60]What the fuck is this?
[142:37.73]Finger runes.
[142:38.61]It might be a way to go down.
[142:43.11]There's gotta be a way to go down.
[142:47.14]Gotta do something weird here.
[142:50.36]This might be part of a quest line or something to get down there.
[143:07.96]Some emotes?
[143:10.02]Let's try some emotes.
[143:12.34]Um, what do we got?
[143:19.29]A gate somewhere has been unlocked.
[143:31.19]Alright, where, yeah, where's like
[143:41.33]OK, well, what about down there?
[143:43.33]That they say a word.
[144:04.81]One of these is going to open it, I swear.
[144:13.85]I imagine going to something like this and just trying every different type of movement.
[144:39.02]Wait, when are they gonna let me in?
[144:40.08]Let me try this.
[144:57.81]Come on, come on.
[144:58.35]Get it through the hole.
[145:00.63]Take that crumpled up piece of paper and get it through here.
[145:09.48]Mushroom, the finger mushrooms maybe?
[145:11.42]Is there just like a prey?
[145:12.38]I'm not sure I have it.
[145:16.46]Oh, prayer.
[145:16.90]Alright, I'm going to sit right here.
[145:19.92]I'm not going to move.
[145:27.71]Stop trying to riz the finger.
[145:47.88]I don't think it's this.
[145:49.79]It's definitely part of a quest.
[145:52.32]But I can go through here.
[145:54.20]This is a really cool area and I'm sure I'll be back.
[145:57.63]I'm going to go through here.
[146:03.50]I don't think I can do it now, whatever it is, but very, very interesting.
[146:24.39]Eat the finger mushroom.
[146:25.39]I don't think I can.
[146:33.84]I think it's it's crafting.
[146:47.32]The mushroom.
[146:49.93]You need to turn into a finger.
[146:51.45]You need to trick the gate.
[146:52.83]That actually might be interesting.
[146:56.84]I could see that actually being a thing.
[146:58.22]Alright, so can I go through here?
[147:06.98]No?
[147:07.30]Maybe not.
[147:12.53]Shit.
[147:14.01]What about up there?
[147:29.24]I think it's a little too high.
[147:36.29]It is.
[147:36.93]I'm stuck down here.
[147:39.61]Unless there's a way to go up this way.
[147:42.50]Doesn't look like this way out of here.
[147:44.12]Unless maybe this way, but I doubt it.
[147:46.08]This is like a mountain.
[148:03.17]Turn messages on pointers.
[148:05.75]I don't play with messages on.
[148:07.27]I know they're really fun and they're really interesting, but.
[148:11.33]I like to.
[148:13.37]Kind of stumble upon things and.
[148:17.26]Stuff like the quests in these games.
[148:19.16]Obviously, yeah, eventually I don't know what the hell I'm going to be doing.
[148:22.08]Remember the Ronnie quest line?
[148:25.00]There was so many specific things you needed to do that in a row before you ended up at that spot.
[148:31.20]I'm sure I'll be looking it up.
[148:33.26]But I don't really want to read that there's a monster around the corner.
[148:38.12]I'd rather get grabbed and have my brain sucked out.
[148:45.02]Because if I see things on the ground, if it's like, ooh, there's some signs, I know there's something over there I need to do.
[148:53.83]Which can be very helpful.
[148:55.95]But I'd rather... Oh, hold on.
[149:00.85]This looks promising.
[149:14.40]Well, I'll come back here later.
[149:28.19]I'm so convinced that there's something here though.
[149:31.53]Not just thing in the middle.
[149:35.57]But I will return at some point later.
[149:46.79]Okay.
[149:48.01]Now the question is, can I go back this way from here?
[149:51.93]Really cool area.
[149:55.89]Oh, I could go down here.
[149:56.81]Let's check that out.
[150:01.06]I want to see what's going on down there.
[150:11.04]Hmm.
[150:16.88]Mambo.
[150:25.69]Go all the way to the end.
[150:26.75]I haven't really fought a boss or anything, but.
[150:37.78]Kind of came into this with a sort of an exploration stream.
[150:43.51]And it's been really, really nice so far.
[150:47.09]They're all very angry that I'm here.
[150:48.45]Why?
[150:53.79]Throwing rocks?
[151:03.12]I missed.
[151:05.26]I missed again.
[151:05.92]Oh shit.
[151:14.55]Don't knock me off the cliff.
[151:15.58]This is a weird place to fight you, by the way.
[151:36.09]Not ideal.
[151:44.58]There we go.
[152:01.88]Get up!
[152:09.47]Oh, yep.
[152:10.05]Misses this shit.
[152:19.67]bought so many of these giants in the base game that this is just like this is like memorize that move okay hefty cracked pot
[152:52.25]If you're doing a big pot build, I wonder how many actual pots are in the game.
[152:56.86]Because that's very useful to know that that guy drops one.
[153:01.53]Judging by the fact that he did throw one.
[153:05.25]OK, so.
[153:07.77]It's another one of these.
[153:22.77]I'm going to make a very specific reference really soon.
[153:26.88]And I would like for all of you that get it to say, I get it when I do it.
[153:33.24]Don't make the reference before I do.
[153:52.81]Alright.
[153:54.61]What is at the tip?
[154:00.86]Graveyard?
[154:21.16]This goes... I'm going all the way down there?
[154:29.88]Hold on.
[154:51.72]Hold on, I know how to deal with these.
[154:52.88]Hold on.
[155:23.50]Here's the very tip.
[155:31.26]St. Trina.
[155:32.52]Disciple.
[155:38.95]A record of crafting techniques left by a disciple who pursued the teachings of a saint.
[155:43.29]Saint of sleep.
[155:44.65]What seemed a gentle sleep.
[155:45.87]Okay, velvet.
[155:47.11]Eternal sleep grease.
[155:48.61]Drawstring eternal sleep grease.
[155:50.87]Sleep grease.
[155:56.90]Little island right there.
[155:58.06]What is that?
[155:58.54]Right here.
[156:00.24]I wonder what that is.
[156:07.77]Uh, okay.
[156:08.47]The reference is... I'm not going to say the reference, but the reference is Chrono Trigger.
[156:11.63]You get it?
[156:27.77]If you know Chrono Trigger, you know what that reference is.
[156:32.81]Whoa, I'm going to kill everybody right here.
[156:51.68]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[156:52.82]Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[157:01.34]This is so dumb.
[157:25.75]Can you do Robo's theme by memory?
[157:28.17]Da-da-da-da-da.
[157:30.23]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[157:32.21]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[157:33.57]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[157:36.77]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[157:37.53]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[157:40.39]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[157:41.01]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[158:02.96]So, uh, Mr. Elbertson, it says here on your resume, on the top of the list, by the way, that one of your biggest skills is to, um, do a song kind of quickly, like a jokey cartoon parade.
[158:17.97]Uh...
[158:22.09]I'm not sure you're going to be able to and I don't know how that helps the firm really at all.
[158:31.75]I'm not really sure what you could do here.
[158:40.33]I guess you could be the guy that's the voicemail guy people call.
[158:51.13]Then we don't want you to do anything goofy because I think people would think that the firm is not serious.
[158:57.31]And it's very serious.
[159:01.69]We deal with estate planning here, Mr. Elbertson.
[159:04.35]This is really, this is important shit.
[159:07.37]Can't have you fucking this all up for us.
[159:30.19]Alright, you don't have to fight every single one of them.
[159:36.45]This is yeah, this is this.
[159:37.39]This is a century old business.
[159:39.75]But you.
[159:40.01]Do you think that's funny?
[159:41.49]But do you think it's funny coming in here and then thinking that you're going to the top of the resume?
[159:46.48]I can do cartoon parade music.
[159:50.95]This is a seven billion dollar company.
[160:16.07]Oooh.
[160:19.44]shadow realm rune plus one what other mysteries are gonna be over here that's a Grace all the way down there I think I can make it from here
[160:45.78]This is like a lifeline or something here.
[160:48.14]It faded away.
[160:48.74]That was like a magical like line of something.
[160:54.04]Maybe like a lifeline or like a magic line.
[160:55.90]Maybe I have to cut them.
[161:02.37]I just need to prove to everybody that I'm not fucking stupid, but I can't go to my map.
[161:18.72]This is so much falling.
[161:21.12]This is so deep.
[161:24.36]I feel like I've been doing this for two hours.
[161:27.50]Just, I keep going further and further down.
[161:34.97]Just down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[161:57.11]You're going into the finger butthole.
[162:03.38]That actually, it was not, not funny because you took the thing, you took like the meme and you may, you changed it a little and you made it a little more interesting for me.
[162:21.22]Congratulations.
[162:32.90]So what is the... Alright, so now what?
[162:34.98]If I have to keep dropping down, I swear.
[162:40.48]I might be able to level up, honestly.
[162:42.06]I have so much shit.
[162:47.73]10.
[162:47.75]Let's call it 20.
[162:49.45]20-ish.
[162:49.55]30, 40-ish.
[162:55.91]No, I need like 200,000 to level up.
[162:59.17]Something is twinkling though.
[163:02.51]You hear that?
[163:07.64]What is twinkling?
[163:22.44]Something I hear twinkling.
[163:23.66]I think it's a cookie bug.
[163:24.84]Where is it?
[163:37.82]Okay, through the cave.
[163:49.88]Stone coffin fissure?
[163:52.98]Dude, we gotta keep going down!
[164:10.18]This is too far down.
[164:11.56]It's too many downs.
[164:19.89]Is the final boss of this game Satan?
[164:26.65]We're going straight to hell.
[164:33.53]Risk on?
[164:35.97]There is a Grace right there, so I agree.
[164:41.10]Mohg like enemies down here.
[164:46.43]You hit really hard.
[164:48.29]Ow.
[164:52.25]Sleep.
[164:54.54]Oh, he put me to sleep.
[164:57.00]Permanently.
[165:13.22]Recharge R2 into R1.
[165:17.19]This might be a later zone.
[165:22.67]Considering just how bad that hurt.
[165:37.85]He's so slow.
[166:01.33]I have to beat this guy.
[166:05.37]It's the hardest enemy in Eldin Wing.
[166:11.91]I just get raided by like five different people.
[166:14.41]Holy shit.
[166:15.83]What is going on?
[166:17.83]Conread's Pants, RTGame, and another one?
[166:22.13]Did three of you raid at the same time?
[166:23.61]What's up?
[166:24.03]Did you guys plan this?
[166:27.55]What's up guys?
[166:32.03]Thanks to the raids, all of you.
[166:35.59]Hope you're having fun in Elden Ring, I know.
[166:37.55]RT, I know you were playing it.
[166:38.77]Connor, were you playing it?
[166:39.49]Is Connor playing it?
[166:42.76]Everybody's playing it.
[166:53.12]Yeah, welcome everybody.
[166:55.08]Currently... I don't know where we are right now, so if you don't want to be spoiled, we are... We're on quite a journey.
[167:05.81]Two and a half hours ago, I went one direction.
[167:09.63]And this direction... You'll see if you... Okay, if you go... Just go down.
[167:16.55]That's all I'm going to say.
[167:18.85]Just go down.
[167:21.36]And then you go down.
[167:25.72]And that's what we've been doing for three hours.
[167:28.82]It's been very interesting.
[167:34.49]Let's freaking go.
[167:35.85]Welcome, raiders.
[167:36.49]Should I go this way?
[167:41.35]I could try to jump.
[167:43.55]I could go risk on right here.
[167:44.59]It would be a really bad idea to do that.
[168:03.77]What?
[168:04.83]That hitbox is huge.
[168:30.41]Guys are pretty brutal.
[168:39.74]I'd say this is probably one of the prettier areas.
[168:41.84]I've said that almost every we go down again.
[168:49.34]No wonder this game has FPS problems.
[168:56.48]It's rendering 60 miles down.
[169:12.06]To be fair, it actually has been pretty good today.
[169:14.28]I haven't had very many problems today.
[169:16.79]I think it's just the outdoor areas like the really big outdoor ones they just cause a ton of drops some of the boss arenas were too okay I this is the worst I'm fine oh
[169:49.32]I hate this game.
[170:15.13]I'm so curious but.
[170:18.35]okay we need a new strategy with these guys it's called pull them over here so they can't even attack me and then kill kill them they jump
[170:58.51]That was a straight response from Miyazaki saying you hate the game.
[171:05.97]Yeah, every time you complain, the game like captures your microphone.
[171:10.99]And if you, anytime you say the words stupid, like damage, like too much damage, like any... Oh my God.
[171:17.74]Yeah, the game gets 0.2% harder every time you make, like talk shit about the game.
[171:31.92]That's kind of an interesting like video game experiment.
[171:36.55]Is, you know, you tell the player like, hey, by the way, like we need access to your microphone and where are they going to put it?
[171:41.25]We want to like hear you.
[171:43.99]Just be like, please, like, you know, obviously like consent to the microphone being used, that kind of thing.
[171:49.38]But just don't tell them that every time that they complain, the game is harder.
[171:55.06]And every time they say something really nice or like compliment the game, it gets like 1% easier.
[172:06.61]This falls down, right?
[172:25.52]And is it safe if I jump down here?
[172:26.74]I mean, it did.
[172:30.54]I didn't.
[172:31.36]OK, I was gonna say I didn't get the animation of the kind of cinematic.
[172:34.38]You fell off the rocks.
[172:37.91]Why is that safe to do?
[172:41.85]That doesn't feel right.
[172:43.25]Considering that I've fallen off ledges in this game that are maybe 15 feet tall and I die.
[173:01.72]No, that's not what I wanted.
[173:21.07]Do not crush my head, please.
[173:31.76]Make a tuna lately.
[173:34.26]I love tuna fish.
[173:36.68]Actually, yeah.
[173:38.90]Last week.
[173:40.24]It's really good.
[173:44.00]Tuna melt is up there at S tier.
[173:46.16]Just is.
[173:48.98]Let me do this right.
[173:56.24]What else here?
[174:02.62]OK.
[174:15.55]Sleep.
[174:19.73]Look at how many there are.
[174:20.59]It's like five over here.
[174:29.95]I knew I was going to stagger him with that third one.
[174:31.93]It was a risk I was willing to take.
[174:44.56]Imagine not liking Mercury meat.
[174:55.08]We just don't eat too much of it, right?
[175:02.61]Yeah, don't eat tuna fish for three meals a day every single week.
[175:42.41]Blood Fiend's Fork.
[175:47.41]Oh, cool.
[175:49.23]Arcane.
[175:49.81]More love for Arcane.
[175:51.11]Damn.
[175:52.03]This is like the fourth or fifth Arcane.
[175:54.23]That's stretching it, but it's like at least three.
[175:59.22]A ritual implement for blood offerings to the formless mother.
[176:02.94]At times, the blood fiends will spill even their own blood using these forks.
[176:21.60]Okay, that staggered.
[176:32.03]More purple lily.
[176:33.01]Let's give myself that soft glow.
[176:44.22]You guys would talk shit about him?
[176:52.08]You wouldn't say this to me at LAN?
[176:54.85]Uh...
[177:11.61]Ooh.
[177:13.19]If you can get that off, it works really well.
[177:16.29]Holy shit, that's really good.
[177:20.24]Whoever told me to do that in the chat, you get one tenth of a second of applause.
[177:24.76]Thank you.
[177:27.58]Appreciate it.
[177:42.02]Oh, it doesn't work if you don't get it.
[177:49.54]That little jab gets me every time.
[177:50.90]Holy shit, he's freaking out.
[178:15.69]How do you like this but not Breath of the Wild?
[178:17.17]Uh, I liked Breath of the Wild.
[178:23.46]What are you talking about?
[178:26.78]Where'd you get that info from?
[178:38.33]I think, okay, I only got one at a time.
[178:39.47]That's good.
[178:42.84]Another Miquella thing.
[178:52.44]I gotta go talk to the guy.
[178:54.14]Remember the guy that was like, if you find any of those Miquella crosses, please come and talk to me.
[179:00.96]I'd love to hear about them.
[179:13.10]Got it off.
[179:13.87]That was lucky.
[179:14.37]I mean, I'm kind of notoriously not a huge Zelda guy.
[179:32.14]No, I'm, you know, I'm notoriously not a Zelda guy.
[179:34.04]What does that even, what?
[179:35.84]But, true.
[179:41.04]Oh, a Grace.
[179:52.49]You say notorious Zelda hater.
[180:00.57]I wouldn't go that far.
[180:05.41]think ocarina of time is one of the obviously stamping points of gaming history and kind of evolving how we play games and you know open worlds and different quest lines and I would say that when I was younger ocarina of time was probably my favorite game
[180:35.36]It was really cool to see the Wind Waker speedrun.
[180:40.92]I abandon here my love.
[180:49.18]I abandon here my love.
[180:50.52]Kindly, Miquella.
[181:03.27]I see you've thrown away something you should not have under any circumstances.
[181:13.86]How will you, how will you salvation offer to those who cannot be saved when you could not even save your other self?
[181:31.77]there's two versions of everybody there's two people shadow version Lands Between version but it's weird though because alright when you fight godfrey
[181:55.74]Turns into Hoarah Loux.
[181:57.56]It's not like, oh, Hoarah Loux's down here in the shadow world.
[181:59.72]It's just he is Hoarah Loux.
[182:01.90]But he's Godfrey.
[182:03.09]But he's not.
[182:03.57]But he's Hoarah Loux.
[182:05.05]And like... Everybody kind of has like a counterpart.
[182:09.35]It's very... It's interesting.
[182:15.19]It's like our... Because there's like... There's shadows, right?
[182:17.71]The blade is a shadow.
[182:21.31]And an Empyrean all have a shadow that follows them and...
[182:28.62]I don't know what's going on.
[182:37.12]Right, because Blade is Ranni's shadow, right?
[182:43.26]Everybody kind of has one.
[182:44.89]I think I can level up now.
[182:52.30]But Blade is not supposed to be Ranni.
[182:54.42]It's Ranni's shadow.
[182:57.28]So is Blade a shadow person?
[183:01.62]Or is it... Is that just like a literal term?
[183:04.74]I don't know.
[183:07.34]Because that's... There's this Ranni and what?
[183:11.21]Renna.
[183:13.41]Hey, I'm Renna.
[183:14.33]Oh, I'm Ranni.
[183:17.01]Renna's Rise.
[183:18.63]But that's supposed to be like Renalla?
[183:19.97]And then when you fight Renalla?
[183:22.31]You're- Ranni is like, hey, don't go near Renalla.
[183:27.49]But fight Renalla.
[183:28.95]It's me as Renalla.
[183:34.63]Yeah, Maliketh is also a shadow.
[183:36.35]Maliketh is Merika's shadow.
[183:41.43]Renna was an alias, not a part of herself.
[183:49.96]Yeah, obviously, I don't know yet.
[183:51.94]And yeah, just keep the spoilers out of chat if you must.
[183:57.47]But, you know, if you have gone that far.
[183:59.61]But, you know, it's very interesting.
[184:02.35]I love this whole thing with the Ura tree.
[184:04.81]It's like, what is the Erdtree?
[184:06.53]Is the Erdtree just like a bad?
[184:08.62]And hey, yeah, because when you fight the Elden Beast, all around the arena are other Erdtrees.
[184:15.66]It's like, is this just another planet being claimed by the Golden Order?
[184:20.56]And how many Erdtrees exist?
[184:22.38]How many like parasitic Erdtrees exist that is everywhere?
[184:25.77]And the Golden Order kind of shows up and is like, yes, we're here and we're golden and everybody's golden.
[184:30.47]But they just kind of fuck the whole entire world up.
[184:33.47]That's interesting.
[184:37.12]Oh, the Erdtree!
[184:38.50]But it's actually the original Erdtree, like the crucible, like the primordial crucible Erdtree is the real one.
[184:47.23]And they kind of just sat on top of it and they're like, look it, we're so beautiful and golden.
[184:50.57]Oh, yes, the flowers are blooming.
[184:53.83]But they're literally draining everybody's life and sucking the fucking planet dry.
[184:59.84]This is pretty good DIY lore.
[185:03.38]Bro, you're on to nothing.
[185:05.54]What are you talking about?
[185:06.44]This is very clearly a lot of other people that OK.
[185:10.32]You need to sit down.
[185:15.61]He says he happened.
[185:19.71]Hey, I like this story.
[185:21.85]I think it's cool.
[185:22.39]Right now I'll go back to playing the game.
[185:32.13]And in my thought, is this, was this like the real world?
[185:37.11]And it got just fucked over wicked bad.
[185:41.75]And look at these like ruins, right?
[185:44.09]Oh, these, the shadow ruins.
[185:46.68]Is this what these are supposed to be?
[185:48.14]And then the Ur tree up, you know, in the other world is like, oh, look at our golden ruins.
[185:53.76]We do that too, you know?
[185:56.40]And it's just, they just like fucking sapped it from these.
[186:13.66]30 endurance.
[186:19.07]But yeah, we can stop talking about lore because I'd rather gravitate away from lore when I, you know, a lot of us and some of us, including me, don't know what's going on.
[186:27.83]Really?
[186:29.43]So I like to ask questions, though.
[186:32.72]Interesting.
[186:34.58]Let's go.
[186:39.56]I do need to take a break.
[186:41.92]EverJail?
[186:43.30]Who's the EverJail people?
[186:47.22]I need to... I haven't stood up in like three hours.
[186:49.42]Let me do that.
[186:50.40]I gotta stretch.
[186:51.47]I gotta take care of my legs.
[186:54.93]And it's starting to be a little bit of a... Yeah.
[186:58.31]Alright, I'll be back in like five minutes.
[187:01.77]See you in a few.
[193:20.13]I'm back.
[193:31.95]Where were we?
[193:37.51]Abandon here my love.
[193:48.42]Already a fight?
[194:05.49]Birds are down here.
[194:11.24]How are the bong rips?
[194:15.04]Totally radical, man.
[194:16.10]Okay.
[194:31.50]These things explode, don't they?
[194:34.38]No, they don't.
[194:36.66]No, they don't.
[194:49.17]These things have these bowls on them.
[195:07.23]What did you have for lunch today?
[195:09.43]Uh, I actually did not eat lunch.
[195:11.73]I've been having essentially Elden Ring breakfast.
[195:20.00]And then I eat a little bit later.
[195:21.34]Yeah, if you don't know, Elden Ring breakfast is a 16 ounce thick peanut butter oats and banana smoothie.
[195:40.51]It just kind of keeps you going.
[195:43.89]Whoa.
[195:45.48]More sleep.
[195:48.56]Sounds good.
[195:49.06]Yeah, it is really good.
[195:51.44]Trying to eat some more oats.
[195:53.52]Put oats into a lot of just little things.
[196:10.39]I don't like... I really don't like oatmeal.
[196:14.02]Oatmeal is... It gets too thick.
[196:18.02]It gets really hard to eat.
[196:19.02]And it cools down really quickly to a point of gelatinous sludge.
[196:24.73]It sticks to... You gotta eat... The second oatmeal is ready, it's way too hot to eat.
[196:31.55]And by the time that you actually want to eat it, it takes you like 40 minutes to eat it.
[196:35.38]And the last like 10 bites are freezing cold.
[196:41.14]But oats, kind of just rolled oats.
[196:44.92]I kind of like them.
[196:46.08]If you get the right ones, I just kind of sprinkle them in smoothies and stuff.
[196:54.49]Don't follow them down.
[196:55.51]Bro, you can fly.
[196:58.23]Bro.
[197:02.75]You're making oatmeal wrong.
[197:04.27]Yeah, I've had good oatmeal.
[197:06.13]I have.
[197:36.37]Don't let anybody ever tell you that all the FromSoftware games are not rhythm games.
[197:48.82]That was right in the head.
[197:54.35]God damn it!
[198:15.91]Yeah, you should be playing this game like Rhythm Heaven.
[198:19.45]you will get better just pretend the sword swings are musical notes that you have to hit
[198:48.43]Oh lord, another one.
[198:49.61]I thought he could hit me in the head from there.
[198:54.61]Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[198:59.40]Damn it.
[199:00.58]Where's the second one?
[199:03.40]Up top.
[199:03.94]I didn't even look.
[199:04.78]I didn't even see.
[199:05.92]Shit.
[199:06.32]Well, I know how to get down there.
[199:19.84]Alright, we're gonna have to move.
[199:32.09]Get away from me.
[199:32.69]I don't have a problem with the bird, people.
[199:42.78]Get the fuck up there!
[199:43.82]Thank you.
[199:44.38]Thanks for the help.
[200:12.79]Okay.
[200:14.77]Get outta here.
[200:20.87]Get outta here.
[200:24.11]Yeah.
[200:28.45]He was just having fun.
[200:30.33]Explode.
[200:36.30]Stop spinning.
[200:37.14]I don't think he's even attacking.
[200:40.60]I think he's just having a good time.
[200:46.73]okay honestly I think it's is there any items right there because this is definitely just a run this is a run and dodge scenario I'm running over there no I'm gonna run around the right side shit
[201:14.98]It's one, two, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[201:22.74]Okay.
[201:28.24]One, two, one, two, one, two.
[201:34.02]So you just, I think it's just two change roles together.
[201:54.85]so
[202:30.88]again dodge dodge down and dodge dodge down it
[202:58.34]Get the fuck away from me!
[202:59.34]What are you doing?
[203:01.80]He's just like kicking his feet like a toddler in the air for five, ten straight minutes.
[203:07.79]Get the fuck out of here.
[203:08.91]Dude turns around the corner and just starts bicycle kicking.
[203:24.18]Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.
[203:29.27]The whole time I have to do... One, two... One, two... Dude.
[203:38.10]Let me tell you.
[203:39.26]FromSoftware was not fucking around with this DLC, dude.
[203:44.30]This shit is fucking hot as nails.
[203:46.28]Hot as nails.
[203:48.00]Dude, FromSoftware?
[203:50.10]They're not fucking around here.
[203:51.38]You know what I mean?
[203:51.94]Get ready.
[203:54.03]Get ready.
[204:00.00]I could put a shield on.
[204:00.78]Let me try that.
[204:05.81]The magic damage?
[204:07.29]Okay.
[204:13.15]Alright.
[204:14.93]Good for you.
[204:20.30]I want high magic defense.
[204:23.84]This'll do.
[204:24.30]Okay.
[204:30.13]Can I just block it?
[204:34.05]Yep.
[204:53.10]Hey, work smarter, not harder.
[205:07.25]There's gonna be another one hanging out somewhere, right?
[205:39.93]I didn't know that was going to happen.
[205:44.25]There's one over there.
[205:47.19]Okay.
[205:51.87]I guess I could really explore this area down here though.
[206:08.87]Alright, was there an item that I ran by?
[206:20.78]Maybe?
[206:21.10]I don't think there is.
[206:31.88]Maybe in this corner.
[206:42.81]Wow, that hurt.
[206:47.53]Get good.
[206:57.83]Looks like the Wiggler Mario.
[207:03.89]It kind of does.
[207:15.52]OK.
[207:20.58]I don't think it's going to be as hard as I think it is.
[207:22.18]I just have to actually do it slow.
[207:32.20]Thank you.
[208:00.34]Gonna drop on me.
[208:05.58]Brave Glovewort.
[208:08.86]Add it to the collection.
[208:17.15]Is this where Nesquik comes from?
[208:23.17]Purple Nesquik.
[208:23.89]What would that even taste like?
[208:30.33]I don't think I really want to drink grape milk.
[208:38.81]Berry milk.
[208:41.51]I could see that.
[208:42.03]Like berries, ice cream, cream.
[208:46.37]That makes sense to me.
[208:52.57]Okay.
[208:52.77]Okay.
[208:59.08]I'm just going to heal because I'm terrified of whatever could be around this corner.
[209:31.11]Hmm.
[209:32.85]Can't get up there.
[209:42.71]Spinning stone six and then another one of these nectar blood.
[209:46.31]What are these again?
[209:47.25]Hold on.
[209:47.83]I think you're chasing me now.
[209:51.49]A young shoot heavy with velvety purple nectar.
[209:59.98]Wait a minute.
[210:02.06]Said to burgeon forth with a nectar like blood of abandoned Trina pulled.
[210:09.48]Abandoned Trina.
[210:20.54]If Micola and Trina are the same.
[210:24.12]Or counterparts, I was Trina abandoned here.
[210:29.35]And isn't Mikolas on a quest through here, through the realm of shadow?
[210:34.61]Is it supposed to be the same person then?
[210:41.76]I don't know.
[210:42.54]Or different people.
[210:45.14]Get away.
[210:54.72]Somebody said this is Five Nights at Freddy's level lore.
[211:07.54]That was the intended developer outcome and I didn't get hit by it.
[211:12.10]That's all I'm going to say.
[211:20.13]Nice.
[211:25.81]So how do you get up there?
[211:34.77]Hmm.
[211:36.57]I'm going down again.
[211:37.33]What is that?
[211:50.09]Grimace milk?
[212:00.46]Oh yeah, the grimace milkshake!
[212:02.10]I forgot about that.
[212:05.49]That would have been so sad.
[212:08.61]Just go get the Grace, you fucking dickhead.
[212:10.71]I never got to taste it.
[212:18.17]I went there two months late.
[212:30.58]What did it taste like?
[212:33.18]What can you compare it to?
[212:38.82]To me, it was a sweet, nectary, velvety flavor.
[212:46.96]Yeah, kind of like, kind of like a velvety purple nectar.
[212:53.30]Don't fall down there.
[213:12.22]Tastes... cabbage?
[213:20.52]A birthday cake dipped in toilet water.
[213:24.52]That's quite the way to describe it.
[213:32.10]I'm just seeing somebody dipping a birthday cake in a toilet and it's like, oh yeah, this is my favorite.
[213:37.13]Let me show you the secret sauce.
[213:41.24]Oh, yeah.
[213:43.41]That's good stuff.
[213:46.23]You want a trash slice?
[213:50.85]No.
[213:51.09]Uh-oh.
[213:54.93]Skeletons.
[214:15.31]A lot of skeletons.
[214:15.93]Did they come back to life?
[214:17.93]They are.
[214:18.43]Okay.
[214:19.03]Where's the person?
[214:20.52]Where's the old hunched over with the bell in their hand that you have to kill?
[214:33.01]That is a giant sack.
[214:37.56]Oh, no.
[214:38.58]No, no, we are not.
[214:42.42]We are not doing that.
[214:44.52]Hold on.
[214:45.30]What's over here?
[214:54.08]I was trying to do that to them.
[214:56.50]I was trying to jump over so then they would fall in.
[215:02.73]The plan was they that was going to happen to the skeletons, not to me.
[215:07.87]My plan did not work as intended, unfortunately.
[215:13.84]I will try that again though.
[215:28.84]One slice that is not there.
[215:49.89]Okay, yeah!
[215:51.17]There's a way to drop down normally, but... Apparently we don't do it like that here.
[216:01.84]Mass of... Is this a spell?
[216:05.20]Putrescence.
[216:09.30]It's an indif... I can probably do this.
[216:14.55]Sorcery originating from the putrid liquor of some of the stone coffins brings a great mass of putrescence that explodes shortly after impact, raining ghost flame upon the area.
[216:25.79]In an age long past, death was burned by ghost flame.
[216:30.94]Even the remains of tainted flesh were given equal treatment in death.
[216:35.16]Death was burned by ghost flame.
[216:39.66]Putrid... Putrid milk voice?
[216:45.03]The Grimace Shake spell.
[216:53.64]Is that relevant still?
[216:54.54]Not really.
[216:55.10]That's not really relevant anymore.
[216:58.86]I don't think that's really relevant.
[217:03.79]That's a lot of minus twos.
[217:04.87]Yeah, it's not relevant.
[217:08.16]Okay, if this had come out a year and a half ago or so, or like a year ago, would you have laughed at that?
[217:15.10]In the middle of all the Grimace Shake shit.
[217:17.01]If it was like, oh my god, the Grimace spell!
[217:18.93]You probably all would have laughed.
[217:23.21]Yeah, you would have.
[217:32.02]Okay, I think this is just get the hell out of here scenario.
[217:37.94]Oh, I think this is a... scenario.
[217:42.49]Hey, boys and girls, this is a... scenario.
[217:52.30]This looks like a get on the horse and gallop around scenario.
[218:01.93]I for you to die.
[218:02.90]Thank you funny.
[218:29.61]Not a mess.
[218:35.44]Is this going to be a sit back here and a swing a million times scenario?
[219:07.06]Thank you.
[219:33.58]I'm going to get a shot of glass from this.
[219:35.86]It's not going to be worth it at all.
[219:45.61]Hmm.
[219:48.11]Hmm.
[219:49.27]Seven.
[219:50.47]Okay.
[219:51.21]Seven Smithing Stone eights.
[219:54.81]Why so many Smithing Stone eights?
[220:01.28]That's a lot of Smithing Stone eights.
[220:08.75]It's misbegotten.
[220:13.67]That looks like that Godfrey shade you fight in the base game.
[220:27.28]Is there anything down here?
[220:28.14]I forget.
[220:29.94]Did I already do this?
[220:33.43]Chatters, help me.
[220:34.15]Did I do this already?
[220:37.08]chat I did yep chat hey chat help great now I have to aggro this and the misbegotten I can't kill them though follow me this way
[221:09.14]Alright, let's do that off the edge.
[221:11.98]You know what?
[221:12.35]I'm going to actually do the tactic I tried to do in the beginning.
[221:34.38]Someone's gonna fall off now.
[221:36.98]Now I could probably get a Diagro.
[221:38.50]As long as I just run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[221:43.60]Hold the corner.
[221:44.30]I should have lost them by now.
[221:46.56]And let's fight the Mistspigot.
[221:51.10]After I look over here.
[221:53.97]Oh shit, already aggroed Wow
[222:26.18]It's been a while since I fought a Misbegotten.
[222:28.08]It's been 110 in-game hours since I've seen one of these.
[222:44.76]Well, now I know where to go.
[222:45.66]Remember when I said I know where to go?
[223:04.49]Well, that's actually the right way, so never mind.
[223:06.17]I was right.
[223:07.43]Alright, let's go.
[223:19.14]Strong button.
[223:21.30]It's a big crow hop.
[223:34.78]Damn dude, slow down.
[223:48.30]Put on some pants.
[223:52.64]Excuse me.
[223:54.59]Well, this is my cool drip, though.
[224:09.37]Go back to the original.
[224:18.61]I must have walked up the edge because I burped.
[224:41.83]Fuck.
[224:49.93]He did it twice last time.
[224:56.81]That was dumb.
[225:15.04]Oh, the varied swing time.
[225:17.09]Is this the same moveset that the Misbegotten's have?
[225:19.65]I feel like this is way harder.
[225:47.07]Did that count?
[225:48.30]Did that count?
[225:49.44]I think that may have counted.
[225:52.90]He wanted to kill me so bad he was going for the Goomba Stomp.
[225:55.22]He turned me into jelly.
[225:56.94]But he might be gone.
[226:00.72]Is he gone?
[226:08.47]No, damn it.
[226:09.51]I didn't get to cheese the whole thing.
[226:11.03]Ugh.
[226:25.42]Dude I spent the whole stream like riding around on the horse looking at pretty pictures.
[226:30.31]I fought like six enemies this whole stream.
[226:32.85]I gotta like remember how to fight enemies.
[226:51.96]Okay, hold on.
[226:52.66]Inside of my ear is like... There's like a bug in there.
[226:55.49]It's so itchy.
[227:02.41]Dude, I don't remember the Misbegotten hitting you and killing you in two swings.
[227:20.04]I need like fucking a hundred more skidoo tree fragments.
[228:02.46]What the hell are you doing?
[228:26.00]Die!
[228:27.08]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[228:29.90]Ooooooh my god!
[228:41.10]I see you, you grimace fuck.
[228:54.28]The earwig just did that?
[228:55.48]That doesn't count for me?
[229:02.22]That wasn't even me playing.
[229:03.78]That was the earwig.
[229:06.48]Oh no, that was me.
[229:09.00]I just felt like a kind of a sensation in my ear and then I felt a deep, weird, sharp pain in my brain.
[229:17.44]It was like a little light like itchy feeling in my ear and then like a huge sharp pain in my head.
[229:22.81]And then I, um.
[229:24.49]I just kind of appeared right here.
[229:27.53]I think that I'm fine.
[229:29.33]I guess I can.
[229:30.05]He walked off the edge.
[229:30.79]Remember when he fell on top of me?
[229:34.20]Yeah, that's why he's not here.
[229:34.98]He fell down with me and then we laughed about it.
[229:38.50]That's what happened.
[229:40.28]Pay attention.
[229:41.66]Wait, what's up here?
[229:48.51]Hold on, nothing.
[229:53.81]But let me, now I can read this.
[229:54.99]36 faith fires a multi-layered golden ring of light that continuously inflicts damage.
[230:02.23]It's the thing he was doing.
[230:04.46]Yeah, there was a few different types.
[230:05.70]Wasn't it, um... Who taught Miquella that stuff?
[230:08.88]Was it Radagon?
[230:09.34]Radagon taught Miquella the, kind of, the rings?
[230:39.96]It's kind of a different school of the incantation magic.
[230:49.81]Nothing else I can do?
[230:50.79]Nope.
[231:00.13]I'm so fucking stupid.
[231:08.13]The part of my brain just said, I don't want to go the long way.
[231:12.25]And the long way was one step down and then one step up.
[231:16.72]It was just, I want to jump over that because I don't want to spend the extra four and a half tenths of a second to fall down and jump.
[231:27.06]You tried to double horse jump.
[231:28.90]We could tell.
[231:29.70]No, I didn't.
[231:33.02]I killed the misbegotten.
[231:34.58]I did not lose a single second of progress.
[231:36.30]We're fine.
[231:41.64]Yeah, I was right here.
[231:43.02]And instead of just going there to there.
[231:48.36]Lazy.
[231:50.72]Wait, how many souls did I have?
[231:56.45]Meh.
[231:58.41]Not really worth it.
[231:58.97]Okay.
[232:15.30]Are we ever gonna meet your earwig?
[232:16.70]Nah, it's the earwig is enough.
[232:25.12]It's like Ratatouille, where the earwig controls me and helps me do stuff.
[232:29.79]But instead of that movie, in the end I die.
[232:33.85]From having my brain fucking torn apart by an earwig.
[232:41.07]Interesting.
[232:46.86]This is like the council of the animals.
[232:51.70]What am I looking at here?
[232:54.40]Welcome to the... This is so... What is happening down here?
[233:01.22]Eagles?
[233:01.64]There's like sheep.
[233:05.18]What is that?
[233:05.78]Okay, what is that?
[233:10.18]What animal is this?
[233:15.02]Is it a fox?
[233:22.32]This is so I love this.
[233:23.96]This is so cute.
[233:26.52]It's so interesting.
[233:27.52]Look at the owl.
[233:33.44]It's a watch party.
[233:36.20]Yeah, where's the movie theater screen?
[233:38.72]Where's the movie for the animals?
[233:44.59]And what is it?
[233:45.29]Why are they all doing this?
[233:46.23]This is weird.
[233:49.94]Now it'd be really funny if there was just a guy here curled up sitting and looking too.
[233:53.30]Okay.
[234:11.72]Let me check.
[234:12.82]Always check.
[234:19.86]They sometimes get cheeky and they put an item right here or even right around here.
[234:24.42]I have at least five to 10,000 minutes in FromSoftware games.
[234:37.33]If you play them for enough time, you just start to understand the tricks.
[234:40.37]You know what I'm saying?
[234:41.05]Okay.
[235:16.67]If we get up here and I'm going down again.
[235:18.93]I just don't know.
[235:25.26]That would be unbelievable.
[235:43.84]It's a boss of some kind.
[235:45.40]Come on.
[235:58.11]Oh, please grant me the courage to fly to your feet, my dearest.
[236:08.87]Saint Trino.
[236:19.21]Well, I think I know what that means.
[236:20.67]Oh shit.
[236:43.37]You fight Santrina?
[236:46.77]Am I to fight Santrina?
[237:02.83]Hello.
[237:06.61]What?
[237:06.89]Is that a pig?
[237:07.95]What?
[237:08.33]No, that was a horse.
[237:14.31]I don't get to go on Torrent.
[237:24.46]I don't get to use my horse?
[237:26.74]What is wrong with your horse?
[237:34.71]Holy shit.
[237:36.05]Hold on.
[237:40.59]Okay.
[237:44.44]That was incredibly painful.
[237:48.60]Putrescent Knight.
[238:00.83]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[238:06.41]Fighting in the grimace milk.
[238:09.40]You guys are coming up with some of these bangers.
[238:11.14]If I said these, everyone would be mad at me.
[238:15.05]I'm glad it's you doing it, not me.
[238:31.53]OK, so he gets off the horse, he throws the shit, he swings a lot.
[238:36.42]I feel like there's not gonna be an opportunity to do that.
[238:43.74]OK.
[239:06.14]Oh my goodness.
[239:12.63]Dude, put this thing down.
[239:13.87]The horse is going to fly at me in a second here.
[239:17.72]Where is it?
[239:20.24]Holy fucking shit.
[239:21.50]What the fuck are you doing?
[239:22.92]What are you doing?
[239:24.51]You just did that twice?
[239:46.66]No, twice.
[240:07.95]Very interesting.
[240:10.66]Uh.
[240:13.78]So.
[240:15.02]Gotta be careful.
[240:19.35]Alright, everybody find each time over the last three days where I've said, what the fuck is he doing?
[240:24.33]And layer them.
[240:25.55]Put them right on top of each other and see if they are identical.
[240:30.67]Oh, actually, this is a good thought.
[240:35.39]I have that on.
[240:36.28]I actually have quite a bit of defense already.
[240:38.82]I don't think it's magic damage, though.
[240:50.41]Hmm.
[240:53.10]Bring out the Mambo?
[240:54.94]Um, not yet.
[240:56.70]How I like to do things is I try to do, you know, a thousand or so attempts, 10, 20-ish attempts.
[241:02.98]And then after I'm satisfied with the challenge, if I beat it, then hooray.
[241:07.29]If not, then we start calling in friends.
[241:11.35]I'd say like somewhere around that like 40 to 50 mark is where it's like, alright, Mambo, come in and give me a hand.
[241:27.55]Physical damage.
[241:30.97]I'm imagining it's a lot of dark flame, which does that count as holy?
[241:35.09]Technically?
[241:36.03]Or just non-physical?
[241:40.83]I don't think I need the intelligence boost right now.
[241:42.71]I feel like I'd like to survive a little longer.
[241:58.34]Ghost flame is technically magic.
[241:59.94]Okay.
[242:04.18]I'm okay with this.
[242:04.95]This is non-physical, right?
[242:07.65]That counts.
[242:11.45]Alright.
[242:11.65]Let's just eat a bunch of hits.
[242:22.81]Alright, so in the first two little things I've seen in this boss, what it seems like is when you think this boss is done attacking, he's going to do the same set of moves probably one more time.
[242:36.16]So let's see what happens.
[242:46.47]He holds the weapon weirdly too that yeah, you almost think like he's going to do it again.
[242:49.49]Like look what I take above his head.
[242:56.14]Yeah, see it's weird.
[242:58.50]Like I anticipate another swing.
[243:03.03]Right?
[243:35.99]Shit No!
[244:00.21]Hey!
[244:01.77]That wasn't very fair.
[244:20.56]What's phase two?
[244:22.50]Aye.
[244:29.73]Alright, here he comes.
[244:32.85]Horse.
[244:34.29]Again.
[244:34.87]Horse.
[244:36.11]Yep.
[244:37.13]Again.
[244:37.79]Oh my goodness.
[244:38.53]The horse is still alive?
[244:39.77]Yep, horse is there.
[244:50.27]Oh, fuck you.
[244:50.93]I dodged it.
[245:16.54]I'm afraid to attack.
[245:17.51]I think he's gonna do it three more times.
[245:32.19]Ooh!
[245:33.47]That was new.
[245:33.91]Uh-oh, phase two.
[245:39.71]Jump it!
[245:41.13]Jump it!
[245:42.47]Jump it!
[245:44.08]Bro.
[245:45.56]Please.
[245:47.12]Hey!
[245:47.86]Yep.
[245:55.98]I gotta ditch the mana potions for this.
[246:00.22]Oh, come on.
[246:13.57]What the fuck?
[246:22.75]Dude, I love when he comes in and does his swings and then my opportunity to attack him.
[246:29.73]And then by the time I have an opportunity to attack him, he has a horse.
[246:33.99]So he's gone.
[246:44.78]Salty.
[246:46.44]No, I actually don't hate this fight.
[246:48.37]I actually think it's, I think it's fun.
[246:51.67]I'm learning, although I'm going to have a lot of an issue with the waves of magical damage that I'm going to be... But it's good.
[246:58.46]I got it.
[246:58.82]I got it.
[246:59.24]I got it.
[247:00.34]I got it.
[247:02.72]It's all about learning what he's doing and why he's doing it, and then screaming into the microphone as loud as I can when I inevitably die right here.
[247:15.17]There's the second swing.
[247:33.47]I got really greedy there.
[247:42.86]You shouldn't be allowed to have a horse.
[247:50.37]I mistimed it by like a second.
[248:16.26]Mm-hmm.
[248:33.57]No!
[248:34.01]Fuck.
[248:51.23]Here comes the horse again.
[249:01.82]Dude, the DLC really does not want you to ever drink out of the flask.
[249:06.92]Is there a build where I could just like heal passively like 24-7?
[249:09.78]Get over here!
[249:36.52]See if I can get a hit in like after one swing or two.
[249:47.40]I just want to see phase two again, please.
[249:55.20]Please.
[249:55.84]Do it.
[250:12.78]No!
[250:14.82]Please don't do it.
[250:16.06]Alright, phase two.
[250:19.84]Here it comes.
[250:21.58]Okay, so what?
[250:22.45]I gotta... Is it a jump or is it... I think you just have to get in... No, it's a... I don't know.
[250:31.45]Run?
[250:32.49]Oh, fuck.
[250:32.91]There's no more apple juice.
[250:38.06]Oh, come on.
[250:40.96]That's so unfair.
[250:43.39]That little blue flame move where it's like, excuse me.
[250:46.71]I got to change the flasks.
[251:02.59]You're topping off a little too much.
[251:05.65]Yeah, I'm one of those people where hard coded into my chimpanzee brain.
[251:12.57]And I think this is just the thing just.
[251:15.00]It's always been like this in FromSoftware games for me.
[251:17.62]If I have less if I have 70% or less health.
[251:22.60]It is hard, it is coded into, it's just coded into my DNA to heal.
[251:26.96]Like if I have like 40%, like 35% like remaining.
[251:31.16]No, not remaining, but like gone from the health bar.
[251:33.46]Drink.
[251:33.66]It's kind of just the way it is.
[251:37.76]And I've told myself, hey, you know, you can take another hit.
[251:41.20]But I almost get scared that I'm going to get hit by something that's a little harder and I'll die.
[251:46.72]But let's go.
[251:47.30]Oops-a-daisy, bad start.
[251:59.32]I I'm not a fan of that move.
[252:01.66]I'm not a fan of that move because you have to be fighting him and he does that move.
[252:08.10]So do you supposed to not be near him?
[252:12.04]I'm not a fan of that one.
[252:17.47]Shit.
[252:21.95]Oh boy, OK, that was bad start.
[252:34.15]Alright, so when you're in and the horse goes up, the horse is either going to come right back down as an attack or it's going to do the AOE melee range, hurt you and knock you back.
[252:43.69]I wonder if there's a tell to which one it's going to be.
[252:55.48]It's a low, he does a low swing.
[252:56.95]So I'm imagining you.
[253:00.19]Somebody said jump over him.
[253:01.19]You could probably jump over them too.
[253:04.03]Let's not add any new mechanics until I can consistently not die in the first, I'd say, 20 seconds of the fight.
[253:15.05]Alright, putrid, putrid knight.
[253:43.56]Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[253:46.14]Delete that from the game.
[253:47.32]Delete that.
[253:49.30]Delete that.
[253:50.47]I was too far away, I was.
[253:51.65]What is...
[254:16.13]Stop running.
[254:17.08]We're supposed to be fighting in a jewel.
[255:04.73]Come on!
[255:05.47]Alright, you have to hit the horse.
[255:31.68]I think you just have to jump over it.
[255:34.68]That's, eh!
[255:36.57]Okay, I have to remember that.
[255:46.45]Oh, fuck you, that was bullshit.
[255:54.52]Oh, from behind!
[255:57.66]From behind, I can't see.
[255:58.94]I don't have eyes in the back of my head.
[256:20.95]That's my one opportunity to have to fucking heal.
[256:33.10]God damn it.
[256:39.66]OK, the fire coming from behind.
[256:42.72]Yeah, I wonder if you just dodge back right when you see the fire, kind of the ring.
[256:49.15]Maybe just dodge backwards.
[256:56.37]Honestly, I think with another handful of attempts, I think I got this.
[257:01.21]I think I'm getting down the pattern, at least the attack pattern.
[257:08.08]Unless there's a phase three, then I should be able to do this.
[257:11.40]I should be able to get it done.
[257:16.01]You could jump over the ring too.
[257:19.99]Yeah, the jump takes a little longer though, and I'm afraid I'll miss the opportunity or I'll jump too early or too late.
[257:26.85]I'm thinking just like a wham, but maybe that's too early.
[257:29.42]I don't fucking know.
[257:33.24]Just take his health to zero already.
[257:34.82]I wonder if you can.
[257:40.57]Can you dodge that move?
[258:08.09]Oh, that one is the one that got me last time too.
[258:13.57]Because it's either two or the three.
[258:18.24]And I don't think there's a way to tell if he's gonna swing a third time.
[258:20.34]He's that same one-two swing, but then sometimes he's just like, you know what?
[258:27.56]I'm gonna throw a fucking third one in.
[258:29.77]Hope you're ready.
[258:43.79]I just noticed this game looks really unrealistic.
[258:48.39]What was it?
[258:48.77]Was it the dragons?
[258:55.29]Was it was it the for me?
[258:58.05]I think it was.
[258:59.73]The expectation that I hold on.
[259:06.82]It was the glowing flowers.
[259:16.64]No, there's glowing flowers on Earth.
[259:28.70]Again?
[259:29.18]I would love to hit you once.
[259:39.27]Oh, please.
[259:54.07]There it is again.
[259:54.75]Fuck you.
[259:55.81]The third swing takes him forever.
[259:57.35]I thought it was... Okay.
[260:06.78]See what I'm saying?
[260:08.16]See what I mean?
[260:10.06]I thought that was going to be the roar.
[260:12.86]Because the roar, if you're in melee range, it hits you.
[260:19.07]And when the horse goes up, it's just flip up, just throw a fucking coin in the air.
[260:23.92]Is it going to be the melee move?
[260:26.78]Or is he going to go?
[260:31.28]You just throw coins in the air to figure out what move is going to happen.
[260:42.23]The roar is too fast.
[260:43.27]Don't try to dodge it.
[260:45.15]Well, that's what I mean, but dodging the melee version of that is what you do.
[260:50.85]So it's like, which one is it going to do?
[260:52.63]I almost just want to turn around and just run.
[261:06.45]Sloppy.
[261:09.21]See?
[261:09.45]I don't even know if you have an opportunity to really run.
[261:31.68]One, two, three.
[261:55.91]He's doing the same excuses the market.
[261:57.75]That's the market excuse.
[261:59.07]I think it's a pretty good excuse though.
[262:02.28]Is he just like, you're like, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[262:06.13]No, you did it when I wasn't ready.
[262:07.91]You should have done it when I was ready, not when I wasn't ready.
[262:10.97]How dare you?
[262:12.39]How dare you change it up on me when I'm supposed to be dodging at the exact time that I think, not what you think.
[262:20.66]Boss.
[262:47.44]Whoa, I hit the button.
[262:48.30]I didn't want to.
[262:58.96]Ah, there it was.
[263:00.32]God.
[263:00.76]God.
[263:23.00]No!
[263:23.53]There it is again!
[263:45.35]Oh, come on.
[263:55.02]I thought it was the roar.
[263:56.52]I really did.
[264:50.24]It's just greed, but it's alright.
[264:57.85]Shit.
[265:01.03]Sometimes the timing on this is really difficult.
[265:10.49]Come on, let me see phase two again so I can learn.
[265:19.59]Here comes space 2.
[265:20.13]OK, here we go.
[265:21.97]Jump.
[265:23.43]Jump and then he does it right down the middle.
[265:30.70]Here comes right down the middle.
[266:02.99]Here it goes.
[266:04.37]Ready?
[266:06.47]Got it.
[266:06.89]Ah.
[266:48.36]Fuck you.
[266:59.37]Whoa, that one was faster.
[267:00.47]Because he's closer.
[267:02.09]Fuck.
[267:48.88]Bad angle.
[268:04.01]Oh, I tried to dodge, but I wasn't quick enough.
[268:05.47]Sorry.
[268:05.81]I was a little too close to him.
[268:16.44]I'm glad I drank a fucking mana potion.
[268:20.42]Why is it even on the... Oh my god.
[268:21.90]Why is it even on the bar?
[268:24.34]Why is it even on the bar?
[268:28.95]Why do I even have a mana potion equipped?
[268:32.67]These little things that you forget to do because there's only one button.
[268:37.85]God damn it.
[268:38.81]That's so frustrating.
[268:43.38]That was a good run, though.
[268:47.44]I think...
[268:50.67]We're close.
[268:57.91]I am very close.
[268:58.85]Just don't be greedy.
[269:00.93]I have the timing of pretty much all the moves down.
[269:04.47]I would say to like a 70 to 80% degree.
[269:12.56]I'm ready.
[269:14.20]I'm locked in.
[269:15.90]That one didn't count.
[269:16.64]That one was not my fault.
[269:17.84]Alright, here we go.
[269:21.37]No, that didn't count.
[269:21.87]That didn't count.
[269:22.39]He started off with a weird move.
[269:33.78]He started off with a move that takes like the three seconds to swing.
[269:36.86]And he usually starts with just the right-handed, one-handed swing.
[269:42.69]That one didn't count.
[269:55.22]But I have, and I mean this, 100% confidence that this thing is dead within the next 10 tries.
[270:03.68]And I mean 100% confident.
[270:15.55]In fact, it's going to be this one right here.
[270:55.67]What?
[270:58.25]Whatever.
[270:58.57]Oops.
[271:03.34]That's not... Oh, I'm in trouble.
[271:06.30]Yeah, the rhythm.
[271:07.44]If you lose the rhythm on that thing, it's just over.
[271:13.43]Okay, so one thing that I have learned is the horse move, if he goes down, it can be followed up with the smash, which I didn't think it could.
[271:22.76]I might reset here.
[271:23.54]That's way too many to lose.
[271:49.74]Has anybody freaked out why that's not hitting me anymore?
[272:27.95]What the fuck is he doing?
[272:29.15]Come over here, man.
[272:31.43]Fuck, that was so much closer.
[272:39.72]Whoa, what the fuck?
[272:40.80]I've had that down for so long.
[272:42.84]Was he spawning closer to me?
[272:46.68]He spawned much closer, I think.
[272:48.26]What the fuck was that?
[273:06.81]I also wonder if I should get some more fragments.
[273:10.37]What do I have?
[273:10.91]Five or six?
[273:16.67]I feel like damage-wise, is 300 or 400 a swing?
[273:19.30]I feel like that's fine, though.
[273:21.36]Maybe not.
[273:32.25]I get him to phase two, I'll get him.
[273:37.87]I started with that bullshit again.
[273:39.34]I wasn't ready for it, but let's keep going.
[274:03.08]Fuck.
[274:05.97]Man, how did I lose that timing?
[274:08.31]I did that like 15 times in a row without getting hit once.
[274:11.00]I think I'm overthinking it.
[274:35.90]I feel like the horse can spawn a little bit closer or a little bit further away, which sort of changes everything.
[274:40.58]Okay.
[274:50.93]Again, be careful because he might start with the really slow one and it's annoying.
[274:55.29]I'm going to drink this now.
[274:58.13]Fuck it.
[275:19.47]There we go.
[275:51.85]He's not doing the five combo anymore.
[275:55.35]Why?
[276:33.76]Okay, never hit him on that way.
[276:55.64]Base two, coming up.
[277:12.21]Thank goodness.
[277:14.89]Here we go.
[277:23.84]Ah, fuck.
[277:34.71]It was one second later.
[278:10.73]Oh, fuck that.
[278:11.33]That was unlucky.
[278:41.21]Ooh, weird.
[278:42.03]He did something different.
[278:42.78]Okay.
[278:45.39]Here we go.
[279:53.11]Okay, come on.
[280:22.45]Okay, it's alright, it's alright.
[281:25.50]Oh, my God.
[282:11.46]Woof!
[283:03.44]Huh?
[284:25.76]Yes!
[284:26.20]Oh!
[284:27.16]Oh!
[284:31.32]Oh, that was hard.
[284:34.06]Dude, if I didn't chug twice in a row, that would have been fucking bad.
[284:46.17]I had to eat that hit.
[284:48.59]I had to.
[284:49.75]In my mind, I saw how many flasks.
[284:51.11]I had four flasks.
[284:52.93]And I'm like, he's got 10% health.
[284:56.15]I have to eat all this damage and just chug.
[284:59.03]Oh.
[285:02.02]Yay.
[285:02.46]I actually really liked that fight.
[285:07.96]Except for one thing.
[285:12.08]When the horse goes up, delete that.
[285:19.74]I was very quiet there.
[285:21.04]Let me tell you, if I had a heart rate monitor, I could feel my heart coming out of my chest.
[285:27.30]I could actually feel it.
[285:28.28]It was like trying to burst out of the front of my body.
[285:30.30]I have like a heart attack by an Elden Ring.
[285:38.82]Okay, well that was what was all the way down here.
[285:43.48]And there might even be more.
[285:48.31]Ugh.
[285:51.95]I started to lose a little bit of confidence, but okay, when you get to like that below 10% mark, you have to just, you just got to quiet everything else in your mind and just get into the flow state.
[286:05.22]That's all.
[286:05.62]You can't do anything else.
[286:08.63]I got hit pretty bad.
[286:10.43]Two or three of those big chains in a row.
[286:12.65]And it was like, confidence.
[286:14.07]Why am I getting hit by this?
[286:15.53]I did it so good.
[286:16.25]No, throw that away.
[286:17.47]Chug three times and kill him.
[286:23.65]Oh hey, I didn't know someone either.
[286:27.60]I was I was prepared to bring out some of our friends.
[286:38.13]I wonder what the remembrance is.
[286:39.09]Probably the weapon.
[286:41.19]Or maybe the.
[286:43.01]Magic on the ground.
[286:50.48]I have no idea how you did this.
[286:53.16]This was, that's right.
[286:54.80]This was the Rhythm Heaven boss.
[286:58.37]I was just, I was just playing Rhythm Heaven.
[287:00.53]That's it.
[287:03.03]It's funny because I, like, I had a little bit of trouble with this, but if you give me a boss where there's actual, like, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, it's like a song.
[287:12.90]And I should be able to do it pretty, pretty well.
[287:18.20]If your boss gets, if your boss is a song, I will do fine.
[287:37.00]Messmer does not sing.
[287:39.88]Well, oh boy.
[287:50.95]I think I can level up.
[287:56.37]Give that earwig a smoothie.
[288:00.90]No, I'm not gonna lie, that was rough.
[288:03.38]It was... Rough is the wrong word.
[288:05.54]It's like... Something about the DLC that I'm noticing, and this might be because of the fragments, but it feels like the boss fights...
[288:17.25]At least if you don't go searching around for these fragment pieces, right?
[288:21.11]And just get a shitload of them.
[288:23.03]That was a long ass fight.
[288:25.37]That was a long fight.
[288:27.51]From start to finish, how long was that?
[288:30.03]That had to have been about like five minutes.
[288:32.61]Five or six minutes total for the whole thing, maybe?
[288:35.47]It's just... These fights are long, and if you get to the end and you die, it's like... Oh, that's another like six minute molten core fucking raid fight.
[288:50.57]Even with the fragments, they're tanky as fuck.
[288:52.35]Yeah.
[288:55.35]You're missing damage opportunities.
[288:56.59]That's why it's long.
[288:59.52]Yeah, you know, and here's the thing.
[289:04.54]This swing is a long animation.
[289:06.96]This one is not.
[289:10.47]But...
[289:13.10]Because this does double.
[289:15.28]I'm so used to pressing R1 though, not L1 to swing.
[289:18.86]Am I crazy?
[289:21.72]Am I crazy to think that I should switch the key bind to have L1 be R1 so I get to do that as R1?
[289:32.11]Yeah, you're crazy.
[289:34.21]Okay, well, let's see what else is in here.
[289:35.69]Alright, well, I got him.
[289:39.69]That was fun.
[289:42.40]All the designs of the bosses have been 10 out of 10.
[289:49.24]I wonder, is this Santrina?
[289:51.78]Are we going to see Santrina?
[289:56.05]I think this is Santrina.
[289:59.37]Is it?
[289:59.57]Alright, I'm going to quiet down here because I really want to hear this.
[290:05.09]What the fuck?
[290:09.65]Whoa, whoa!
[290:11.31]It's the face!
[290:12.03]I don't know what to do.
[290:15.43]Should I do this?
[290:15.93]I don't know if I want to do this.
[290:22.40]This is weird, man.
[290:32.25]What the fuck?
[290:46.51]No, I don't want to do this.
[290:47.89]If I do this, then I'm gonna fall asleep or something.
[290:50.01]I'm gonna go to sleep.
[290:55.52]Wait, there's items everywhere.
[290:56.44]Hold on.
[290:57.58]Can I... I'll be back.
[291:08.22]Let me just take all your stuff.
[291:22.83]A record of crafting techniques left by a disciple pursued the teachings of the saint of sleep.
[291:27.90]Yet what seemed a gentle sleep at first ripened into velvet.
[291:30.58]Acquire the knowledge to craft the following lulling branch.
[291:34.78]Alright, fuck it.
[291:35.26]We're doing it.
[291:38.60]Whatever.
[291:39.34]I may have like locked myself out of a different ending, but I'm down here and I want to know.
[292:01.70]journey ends.
[292:03.83]You drank a flower person and died.
[292:09.81]What the hell?
[292:10.45]I'm gonna go fuck this motherfucker up.
[292:14.43]Think that's funny, Saint Trainer?
[292:17.66]It's time for you to face the wrath of the sword of night and flame.
[292:24.92]I can't.
[292:25.50]R1's not doing anything.
[292:28.45]That's funny.
[292:28.95]Wait, what happens if I do it again?
[292:59.76]You have runes to... I thought I didn't spend them?
[293:09.75]No, I didn't.
[293:10.95]Oh.
[293:13.47]Oh, whatever.
[293:14.19]I can just go to Mohg's Palace and get 500 million runes in 10 minutes.
[293:19.49]Who cares?
[293:21.74]Dormammu, I'm here to bargain.
[293:25.70]Dormammu, I'm here to bargain.
[293:43.36]Dude, you've been too Marvel-pilled.
[293:44.92]-2.
[293:46.78]The last Marvel movie I saw was Endgame.
[293:52.31]And I stood up and I clapped at the end of that movie.
[294:02.82]Okay, well, this is crazy.
[294:03.60]Okay, so... There has to be something I can do with this.
[294:06.08]There's gonna be some big, long chain.
[294:08.80]There's gonna be some long, runny quest line where you come down here and you drink the thing and you don't die and you run around and you go to the new zone.
[294:16.53]There's a new area and then you... Oh, I'm getting dizzy.
[294:19.29]Hold on.
[294:20.49]Hold on.
[294:22.41]Okay, well, that was cool.
[294:24.79]Do it one more time.
[294:25.81]Do it one more.
[294:29.53]One more time.
[294:30.47]Alright, one more for the road.
[294:51.11]I don't think this is going to do anything if I keep doing this, guys.
[294:53.55]I know it's a FromSoftware game and eating and drinking things and talking to people a thousand times.
[295:00.28]It did do something.
[295:09.93]Don't turn the poor thing into a god.
[295:23.88]What?
[295:24.02]We're going to do it again.
[295:32.35]Make Nicola stop.
[295:33.93]Don't turn the poor thing into a turn like Nicola.
[295:36.91]Don't turn Nicola into a God.
[295:41.83]Give me some more of that fucking death juice.
[295:48.25]Give me some more knowledge.
[295:50.02]I actually can't believe that that happened.
[295:52.78]So it is the FromSoftware meme.
[295:54.06]Do the same thing like 15 times.
[296:01.45]No, you gotta talk to this character five times in a row before they actually talk to you.
[296:13.16]More dialog?
[296:15.82]Damn, alright, well, uh, let's keep going.
[296:22.43]There's obviously probably more.
[296:44.63]So Miquella wants to turn into a god.
[296:47.89]For some reason.
[296:50.37]Or somebody's trying to turn Miquella into a god.
[296:55.31]Anything else?
[296:59.77]This is such a wild character design too.
[297:02.61]Just roots.
[297:05.01]I think St. Trina is just a flower.
[297:06.79]Yeah, actually a flower growing out of the ground.
[297:10.47]With a head and two arms.
[297:24.09]We gotta kill Miquella.
[297:31.57]Oh no.
[297:32.51]Forgiveness?
[297:39.12]What did Miquella do?
[297:54.67]You know, Santrino.
[297:56.43]This could have been an email.
[298:10.64]Does forgiveness mean death?
[298:14.78]I guess we have to find out what... We gotta find out what Miquella is up to.
[298:20.12]What Miquella is actually up to.
[298:31.63]I think that's it.
[298:51.04]It's insane that this whole thing takes, this whole game takes place in New York.
[298:54.03]It's like so weird.
[298:54.93]It's interesting.
[298:57.71]What do they call like the not so distant New York or something?
[298:59.91]That's cool.
[299:07.31]Which is why I've seen like places that kind of look like this and like Central Parker think.
[299:19.21]No guys, you cannot are one spam St. Trina.
[299:22.21]You can't.
[299:22.71]I can't attack anything in here.
[299:24.45]I already tried.
[299:36.41]Cool.
[299:36.62]Well, let's go see what the remembrance does.
[300:08.18]Hold on.
[300:48.01]The mountain?
[300:48.85]Like, here?
[301:00.20]Like, this looks like the same map.
[301:03.42]Like, is this, like, essentially... It kind of looks pretty similar.
[301:09.10]Is it too high for this?
[301:11.26]Yeah, it looks almost... It almost looks mirrored.
[301:15.13]Because this is where I am right now, right?
[301:17.67]And if you kind of... This is like the mountain.
[301:20.13]Because this was... Wasn't this called Altus?
[301:22.79]Like Shadow Altus, right?
[301:23.93]So then wouldn't this be effectively where the Haligtree is in the other world?
[301:29.80]If it's kind of mirrored in a way?
[301:32.22]Or is it my... No, not quite.
[301:38.25]I guess it would be like here.
[301:42.45]Cool.
[301:44.56]I wonder if you could even go here.
[301:47.02]It doesn't... It might be something here.
[301:50.80]But... I don't know.
[301:52.04]As I'm looking at the map, it's kind of like... There's all these huge mountains.
[301:55.97]And then the Haligtree.
[301:56.81]And it's like all these huge mountains.
[301:59.09]And then Santrina's area.
[302:01.05]And it's kind of off down here.
[302:02.95]Just kind of like this is off down up here.
[302:13.26]Cool.
[302:17.37]Yeah, Malenia was a flower too.
[302:21.11]I'm very curious about the remembrance.
[302:22.49]And what are the Two Fingers?
[302:23.97]I've been looking for this for two years.
[302:25.89]What are you?
[302:26.49]Oh boy.
[302:35.84]Arcane is getting so much shit in this DLC.
[302:40.78]Wow.
[302:44.28]Hey, if you haven't got the DLC yet, roll arcane.
[302:48.76]Because there is a lot of items for Arcane as of now.
[302:55.09]And I think you throw it?
[302:56.29]Oh, it's Overhead Chop.
[302:57.47]Interesting.
[302:58.03]And then what's this?
[303:16.28]Another dual int faith.
[303:17.98]I could get this.
[303:23.42]Launches a world of putrescent jets that explode shortly after impact and bathe the area in ghost flame.
[303:28.96]In an age long past, death was burned by ghost flame.
[303:35.91]Even the remains of tainted flesh were given equal treatment in death.
[303:42.73]Yeah, Arcane is absolutely popping off in this DLC.
[303:45.13]It's crazy.
[303:51.16]Well, I don't necessarily care about crushing the runes, and I'm not really doing arcane or strength, really.
[303:56.30]I mean, I am, but not necessarily a big weapon, a big greataxe like this.
[304:03.34]It does look like the orphan, whatever, like umbilical cord or whatever it is.
[304:11.18]But this is the one that I realistically would be able to use eventually, so I think I'm going to get this one.
[304:22.00]Please showcase the weapon for YouTube.
[304:29.16]Uh... Realistically, here's the thing, though.
[304:42.05]Realistically, I'm probably not going to use this, but like owning this and having the possibility of respect for whatever reason, whenever is not something I'm against.
[305:00.82]I could do both, but I would need to remember the remembrance.
[305:06.58]Yeah, I want to get this.
[305:08.94]I still don't know what to do with the, with this one.
[305:15.64]What about equipment?
[305:16.28]Anything new?
[305:25.67]Not necessarily.
[305:26.53]I'll roll on his helm.
[305:28.03]Alright, I'll showcase it for YouTube.
[305:36.67]OK.
[305:38.55]Fine.
[305:42.27]Let me do a YouTube showcase with it.
[305:43.63]Give me a second.
[305:50.96]Yeah, if you're new to the channel, what I do is every weapon in the game, I do like a one to two minute breakdown.
[305:57.22]So let's get one of these done here.
[305:59.56]A lot more curve than I thought it was going to be.
[306:08.05]Okay.
[306:09.75]Okay.
[306:23.79]What is up, YouTube?
[306:25.23]I'm here again with another weapon review and breakdown.
[306:27.84]I am here with the Putrescent's Cleaver.
[306:31.52]This is a boss remembrance weapon.
[306:33.76]You get this from beating the Putrescent's Knight down in St.
[306:36.65]Trina's Lair.
[306:37.31]For those of you that are curious where it is,
[306:40.53]Gonna showcase it.
[306:41.23]It's a very heavy greataxe.
[306:43.29]It has a pretty standard greataxe swing animation.
[306:46.84]And the R2, the heavy charge attack, is pretty good as well.
[306:51.06]I would say the range is not great, but hits pretty hard.
[306:53.86]Scales with arcane for all you arcane users.
[306:56.64]And let me showcase this.
[307:03.39]I'm sorry, I have to do a retake.
[307:05.31]I have to do a retake of this whole video.
[307:08.59]What was that?
[307:25.60]Make sure you subscribe and send me a like, and I'll see you in the next weapon review.
[307:32.16]Remember, strengthen arcane, shove it up your ass.
[307:36.22]Alright, see you later.
[307:41.47]I did not, I was not expecting that.
[307:48.85]Ring that bell.
[308:01.21]I can't do it.
[308:05.81]Ugh.
[308:15.70]What is going on YouTube?
[308:16.82]Hey, how are you?
[308:17.99]Welcome to another weapon review.
[308:19.35]We're here with the dagger.
[308:20.75]The standard dagger in Elden Ring's FromSoftware.
[308:26.44]game and the cool thing about this it's a standard dagger it has a standard parry motion you get the quick step with this one slashing speed is about one to two swings per second which is very quickly critical damage is going to be really high 110 rather than standard 100 that you'll find on most weapons its weapon art is good for a swamp if you're going to find yourself in a swamp area it actually moves very quickly charged r2 is going to give you slashes instead of the the pokes
[308:55.89]And then, of course, jumping R1, jumping R2.
[308:59.80]That is the dagger.
[309:01.26]And by the way, you can dual wield this.
[309:05.50]So I can have two daggers in one... Fuck!
[309:15.07]Fucking idiot.
[309:17.49]Piece of fucking shit.
[309:19.41]Fuck this fucking game.
[309:21.77]Sick of fucking doing this.
[309:23.57]I'm sick of fucking doing this.
[309:30.24]Hey, what is up, YouTube?
[309:31.16]Welcome to another weapon!
[309:34.54]Weapon showcase.
[309:35.48]I got the dagger.
[309:36.26]Uh, do a welding the dagger to start, but I do want to take a quick second to show you what it can do.
[309:41.00]Uh, standard dagger.
[309:42.64]You can buy this on most merchants.
[309:44.72]The slash is pretty cool.
[309:46.72]The, uh, combined two-handed swing is... You can do about five swings before you have to put it down.
[309:51.88]Again, I said you can do weld this, which gives you a pretty good... Fucking swear to God.
[310:04.14]I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[310:14.60]Hey guys, here with the dagger.
[310:16.04]It's a weapon in Elden Ring.
[310:17.59]It's part of the weapon showcase.
[310:18.83]As you see here, it does a pretty good slash.
[310:21.37]Pretty interesting jump attack too.
[310:24.27]You can get this at pretty much any merchant.
[310:25.91]It scales off of dexterity.
[310:27.19]If you're looking for a quick build, I'd say this is a good start.
[310:30.40]It's got a pretty good five-hit chain as well as dual weldable, which as you see here, it's got a pretty good...
[310:36.54]combo it's very fast and I hit it I think it hits a total of 15 times so if you're trying to apply bleed or rot or if you want to put it on there it's pretty good there are other daggers in the game later which I'll show you at some point uh make sure to subscribe to the channel and stick around but yeah that's the dagger 110 crits by the way rather than the standard 100 yeah thanks for watching and make sure you subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
[311:04.99]Yes.
[311:05.27]Yes.
[311:06.73]Still got it, man.
[311:07.65]You still fucking got it.
[311:09.09]Don't ever let anybody fucking tell you you can't do shit, man.
[311:14.81]Look at that.
[311:15.23]Fuck you, man.
[311:17.35]Alright, I'm done.
[311:23.48]Oh, I forgot about quick step.
[311:30.58]I'll edit it together.
[311:31.54]You can cut it together.
[311:32.24]Who cares?
[311:40.67]Hey, you know what's wicked funny?
[311:42.10]That ain't that far from the truth, by the way.
[311:44.40]You know how many times I, like, recorded a fucking video and I, like, messed up a sentence and I was just like, oh, you idiot.
[311:55.24]Just turn it off and do it again.
[311:56.41]It's a glimpse into the world of YouTubers.
[312:08.09]There's some people that can get it every time.
[312:10.22]Sorry.
[312:12.42]Play the rest of the DLC with no HUD?
[312:14.14]No, I don't think so.
[312:24.09]Wait, did I say that?
[312:25.87]Hello, everybody.
[312:26.63]My name is Welcome.
[312:29.87]I didn't say that.
[312:31.27]Did I?
[312:37.02]Welcome?
[312:40.04]No, I did not.
[312:46.99]It's a Markiplier bit.
[312:48.66]Oh, okay, okay.
[313:04.87]Where are my weapons?
[313:08.65]Elden Ring's from... Oh yeah, that's what it was.
[313:10.60]Elden Ring's FromSoftware.
[313:16.78]Hey, everybody, checking out a new weapon.
[313:18.16]This is called the Skeleton Smasher.
[313:22.77]This weapon is very, very cool considering its weapon art.
[313:27.23]You have three skeletons come in and do a swing.
[313:29.55]It hits four times.
[313:31.55]I would say it's pretty good.
[313:32.95]Next video.
[313:37.85]Hey guys, welcome.
[313:38.49]This is the Gargoyle's Twinblade.
[313:40.49]It has a pretty cool move.
[313:41.45]It's got a slash like this.
[313:43.87]And it's a dexterity weapon if you're looking for a dex thing and you don't want to use daggers, which we've covered previously.
[313:49.93]And ring the bell.
[313:55.10]Guys, I'm here with the Serpentblade.
[313:56.72]No, fuck.
[313:57.28]It's got to be in a different location.
[314:01.42]Otherwise, they'll know.
[314:06.29]Hey guys, here with another weapon review.
[314:09.29]Here with the Serpent Blade Stinger.
[314:11.89]This thing is beautiful looking.
[314:13.31]The artwork is fantastic.
[314:14.81]And its weapon art is something to die for, as you see there.
[314:17.96]Thanks a lot.
[314:18.46]Subscribe to the channel and press the bell with your thumb.
[314:24.82]Alright, I'm done.
[314:26.00]Look behind you.
[314:29.76]What?
[314:34.12]What happened to the tree?
[314:42.38]What do you mean, what happened to the tree?
[315:00.51]Oh!
[315:02.47]I hope you... Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[315:05.63]My game's fucked up.
[315:06.47]I modded it.
[315:07.49]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[315:08.51]I gotta get out of here.
[315:09.19]Otherwise... I'm playing the DLC.
[315:16.74]I modded it.
[315:17.24]I modded the game.
[315:19.08]Um... What happened to the... Oh, I know it's probably a joke and you're just fucking around, but that's so...
[315:41.05]It's so sad if it's real.
[315:43.53]That's so sad, man.
[315:44.81]Like, I mean, I'm clearly playing the DLC and it's bad.
[315:47.95]I'm like, I have like 200 hours on this game on stream and shit.
[315:51.71]It's like, I feel bad if it's real, but dude, I'm sorry.
[315:55.55]I'm sorry.
[315:56.67]This is the DLC.
[316:04.93]You piece of shit, you spoil- I did- I didn't know that you were- If you want- Don't- Why are you watching Elden Ring streams two days after the DLC came out?
[316:16.72]Dude, I'm sorry, you can't go into, like, Comic Con with your ears closed saying, I haven't seen Infinity War.
[316:23.66]Nobody spoil it.
[316:24.66]All the Thanoses walking around with the gauntlets on their hands.
[316:34.89]Oh, that's so funny.
[316:36.23]I feel so bad if that's true.
[316:38.89]But... That's so... Hey, don't worry.
[316:43.98]Don't worry.
[316:44.50]This game's fucked up, man.
[316:46.70]Like, don't worry.
[316:48.66]It's not that much.
[316:50.66]Don't worry about it.
[316:51.64]There's 10,000 other pieces of lore that are gonna be huge twists that you have no idea what the fuck is going on.
[316:57.31]Don't worry.
[316:58.05]It's gonna be fine.
[316:58.97]Okay.
[316:59.59]Time to kill this dragon over here.
[317:01.91]And then I'm probably gonna stop.
[317:10.50]oh god that was funny I just keep thinking of some some poor soul that just there's so many layers to why that is just doing it over and over again for me but I hope you enjoy the game it's a wonderful experience
[317:50.31]Am I going to be live tomorrow?
[317:51.39]I am not.
[317:52.77]I'm probably going to be taking a little break from the streaming Elden Ring DLC.
[317:56.87]I might play a little bit off stream.
[317:59.47]I know that it's... I did say that the DLC was going to be something I was going to play.
[318:11.75]But we'll see.
[318:13.02]We'll see.
[318:13.70]You never know.
[318:14.30]I might just show up.
[318:16.76]I might just show up in front of fucking Godfrey's chamber.
[318:32.41]I was 100 years away from that when that happened.
[318:47.73]Well, that was good.
[318:49.03]Good iframes.
[319:13.29]You're nothing compared to the putrid knight.
[319:15.11]This is really loud now for some reason.
[319:16.99]Am I crazy?
[319:41.91]Yeah, let's fuck around.
[319:45.90]Who should we bring out?
[319:46.62]Mambo or Yoda?
[319:49.06]I'm thinking Yoda.
[319:55.05]I'm thinking Mambo.
[320:02.81]Sent summoned spirit back to the beyond?
[320:05.27]What the fuck are you talking about?
[320:25.22]in trouble oh I'm in trouble I'm dead goodbye that is your last dream good luck with everything it's not my last stream
[320:59.21]Okay, I want to bring out... We gotta get Yoda out.
[321:02.29]Alright, Yoda.
[321:13.20]You and me.
[321:16.24]Come with me.
[321:17.14]By the way, I will say the Yoda fight is probably my favorite of the game so far, and I'm not kidding.
[321:25.08]That was so fun.
[321:26.46]It was so quick and so visceral.
[321:28.12]That was probably the best fight of the whole game so far.
[321:30.56]I loved it.
[321:35.09]It wouldn't work already.
[321:37.35]Oh my goodness.
[321:38.25]I did not... I thought he was facing the other way.
[321:50.39]Don't get hit by this.
[321:51.31]He's going to do it.
[322:06.75]Oh, Yoda doing work.
[322:23.43]Careful, don't get crushed.
[322:36.22]Get a stacker in.
[322:39.77]Good.
[322:58.72]Got it.
[323:02.38]Oh, don't!
[323:02.96]No!
[323:03.32]Don't block my view with these gravestones!
[323:05.62]I don't know what he's doing!
[323:11.95]Thank God for Yoda.
[323:26.15]Come on, stagger!
[323:32.84]Uh oh.
[323:46.19]There it is.
[324:07.87]No, come on.
[324:14.59]Oh, good opportunity.
[324:15.15]Let's get another one.
[324:18.91]Yes!
[324:33.44]Watch out for that sauce that comes out.
[324:45.54]Alright, don't be stupid here, he's gonna... Oh, get it again!
[325:09.94]Oh, Yoda, you're in trouble.
[325:18.00]Oh, he's doing it again.
[325:18.72]No, he's not.
[325:22.76]He summoned all these dickheads.
[325:23.82]Oh, there's so much shit going on.
[325:44.33]Oh, too many people.
[326:01.43]No!
[326:01.71]Alright, this is it.
[326:16.06]I can't hit his foot!
[326:24.03]Holy shit!
[326:26.29]Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh!
[326:34.93]Uh-oh!
[326:38.19]Uh-oh!
[326:48.93]Yeah!
[326:52.11]Oh boy.
[326:57.51]Somber ancient dragon Smithing Stone.
[326:59.89]I'll take it.
[327:00.95]Yoda's still alive.
[327:15.96]Let's end this, please.
[327:28.96]They're flooding you with stones in this.
[327:33.23]Thanks a lot, Yoda, for the help.
[327:43.58]Okay, why am I still in combat?
[327:47.67]What's that?
[327:48.01]Alright, this is the last thing I'm doing.
[327:51.55]And then I'll go.
[327:59.63]Alright, this is the route I'm gonna take and I'm gonna end.
[328:01.37]Okay, that's the route I'm taking and then I'm gonna end stream.
[328:20.30]Let me refill.
[328:31.40]If you don't stream it, could you please record yourself getting mad at bosses?
[328:36.01]You show up with... You know what?
[328:40.81]Wait a minute, this is... I changed my mind.
[328:42.81]What's this?
[328:52.76]Ah, this is... No, this is not where I went.
[328:54.98]Wait, hold on.
[328:55.74]A different view of this huge, huge-ass dragon.
[329:05.17]And you get some weapon reviews for us.
[329:07.71]I am going to promise you guys one thing.
[329:10.69]I know that like I don't really stream that much anymore.
[329:13.18]And kind of doing other stuff and slowing down in the streaming.
[329:17.64]But I will guarantee you.
[329:20.64]I will stream Elden Ring again.
[329:22.62]You're going to see this again on this broadcast.
[329:25.05]I am assuring you.
[329:30.47]I don't know.
[329:30.97]Could be a week or two.
[329:31.93]I don't know.
[329:32.92]It depends on how much I get through the DLC.
[329:37.62]Or I might keep this character right here.
[329:42.32]You never know.
[329:45.23]Because I've been playing this for three straight days.
[329:49.59]And there's some other things that I need to do.
[329:53.91]You have a forked tongue.
[329:55.17]I don't believe you.
[330:04.83]Alright, I'm already fucking up what I was supposed to do.
[330:06.77]I was going to go over here.
[330:07.49]What's that?
[330:23.18]Okay, I wanted to check out this little island.
[330:25.32]But there's a couple of those things over here.
[330:43.84]What about the Dark Souls Clipstream?
[330:46.45]Absolutely.
[330:48.43]For those of you that don't know, that don't know what we're talking about,
[330:51.76]I have probably five, probably four, I want to say like probably three or four hundred clips of every single FromSoftware game.
[331:01.29]We're talking Demon's Souls, we're talking Bloodborne, Dark Souls 2.
[331:04.97]I have, I used to have an Xbox.
[331:07.39]Well, I still do.
[331:09.15]And this Xbox, ooh, over the last like two or three years, I just record clips sometimes because something crazy happens and it makes me laugh.
[331:20.62]So, I promise we will do... We will do a night where we just kind of go over a bunch of just stupid clips.
[331:29.03]Tons of them.
[331:29.57]Maybe for one or two game at a time or something.
[331:31.49]I don't know.
[331:34.61]But I'm... I do have a lot of them.
[331:37.91]And some of them are bangers.
[331:39.19]Some of them I've been holding on to for a long time that are really, really funny.
[331:44.84]I just think they're hilarious and need to be... Somebody has to see them.
[331:48.24]Besides my girlfriend.
[331:49.40]My girlfriend.
[331:51.29]Polly and I will just laugh our asses off at these, but they need to be seen by the world.
[331:55.84]They have to.
[332:01.60]How do I get over there?
[332:08.60]I have no fucking heal.
[332:19.79]You're going to open up your time capsule of forgotten clips.
[332:27.73]Some of them are very good.
[332:28.71]Okay.
[332:37.82]Wait a minute.
[332:38.76]Hey.
[332:39.92]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[332:42.87]I know you.
[332:43.57]I have...
[332:51.13]Wait.
[332:55.84]Are you just a regular enemy now?
[332:57.44]No.
[332:57.66]You're just a regular enemy now.
[333:06.60]Holy shit, he killed and didn't even look at me.
[333:13.39]Where is that?
[333:14.03]Because there needs to be a Jedi fight right now.
[333:38.41]I don't really want to get my stream turned off the VOD, but I really want to play Duel of Fates so bad.
[333:44.28]What do I care?
[333:47.50]Do I really care that much about that?
[333:53.30]I kind of do, because I think people want to watch that.
[334:03.75]It would only mute that part of the VOD, right?
[334:05.57]It wouldn't do the whole thing, would it?
[334:10.08]How did I even get in there?
[334:13.90]Separate audio track?
[334:15.62]I don't think so.
[334:17.90]I think it all comes through the same channel eventually.
[334:20.16]Alright, this has got to be a completely fair fight.
[334:30.67]There it is.
[334:36.59]I'll do it.
[334:37.07]It's okay.
[334:37.75]We're at the end of the stream.
[334:41.87]Let me get everything ready.
[334:45.33]This is really important to me.
[334:57.84]I gotta make sure everything is ready for this because this is where we're going to end.
[335:07.85]OK.
[335:07.95]You guys ready?
[335:12.76]Here comes a Jedi fight.
[335:15.04]This will take us out to the end.
[335:16.27]Duel of the Fates.
[335:39.34]Okay, here it comes.
[335:41.09]Let me just load it up.
[335:48.36]And I'm going to watch it through the telescope.
[336:02.38]Are you ready?
[336:18.16]Let's go!
[336:38.19]Oh no!
[336:42.94]Whoa!
[336:45.72]No, fight each other!
[337:01.92]Where is he?
[337:12.66]No, you get back here.
[337:24.17]I don't know who's going to win.
[337:24.93]I don't know who has more health.
[337:44.01]Oh, he got him.
[337:44.63]He won.
[337:45.03]He killed him.
[337:53.40]He won.
[337:53.88]I distracted him with my body.
[337:59.66]I wonder if he's actually dead.
[338:00.60]Hold on.
[338:19.57]Probably respawns, yeah.
[338:21.27]That's crazy that it... Yosh becomes a... Regular... Oh no, it was Onze.
[338:27.99]Or Onz?
[338:28.81]Onz?
[338:30.37]A regular enemy now.
[338:31.59]But I love that fight.
[338:32.51]I love fighting against that.
[338:34.47]The little demi-human lightsaber enemies.
[338:36.27]It's so cool.
[338:37.05]I love them.
[338:41.85]I would love the weapon.
[338:42.87]I wish I could get it.
[338:44.43]I'm sure it's available.
[338:46.70]Who knows where it is?
[338:49.45]Okay, now keep going this way.
[338:53.54]You lost 126,000 souls.
[338:55.34]Well, it was $126,000 to get those two actors to do that for 10 minutes.
[339:00.00]So that's okay.
[339:14.29]No, he's gone.
[339:15.84]Oh, no, he's right there.
[339:19.87]Interesting, OK, I actually kind of love this something right here.
[339:27.03]Smithing Stone.
[339:41.40]Let's fucking go.
[339:50.28]That's it right there.
[339:51.78]I ask and you shall receive.
[339:53.31]That's the sword right there.
[339:59.99]That is definitely the sword.
[340:01.43]I can't wait to look at it.
[340:03.59]Oh, wow.
[340:04.35]Cool.
[340:05.73]Yeah.
[340:09.62]I wish I could shrink my character down like 20-30%.
[340:11.82]Just walk around with that.
[340:16.44]I love these, the Demihumans.
[340:17.80]They're so... I just love that they're like... They're so interesting.
[340:24.12]Alright, I'm going to go back to the House of Grace, whatever it is.
[340:31.69]Grace Hold?
[340:33.95]Grace Hold.
[340:35.41]Fortified Grace Hold.
[340:36.77]What is it called?
[340:41.05]Grace's Frontier.
[340:45.90]The round table hold.
[340:47.88]That's right.
[340:56.29]OK.
[340:57.71]I just wanted to get out of here.
[340:58.91]I'm so excited to look at this thing.
[341:04.67]There we go.
[341:13.72]Called spirit sword.
[341:17.69]Looks like a pretty standard, like a rapier?
[341:23.17]It's kind of chunky looking.
[341:25.33]There it is.
[341:25.69]A sharp blade sculpted into a twisted shape, a sword that has seen many years of use in the gravesite.
[341:35.58]Wait.
[341:38.50]This is not it.
[341:42.30]It scales with int though.
[341:44.30]Int dex?
[341:44.94]Is it a different?
[341:45.66]No, is this it?
[341:51.12]It's not it, but it's actually one of the first int dex weapons in the game that I found, so I'm curious about it.
[341:58.64]Let's go test it out.
[342:08.89]No, I can't do that.
[342:21.53]No spoilers this time.
[342:25.97]It's kind of like a standard curved sword.
[342:30.21]I want that little green rapier so bad.
[342:32.74]I will find it.
[342:38.74]Cool.
[342:40.10]So what about this?
[342:44.00]Interesting.
[342:46.45]Any follow-up?
[342:51.95]Here's a follow-up.
[343:00.78]How much does this hurt?
[343:03.20]I know I'm not this build anymore, but... That can't be right.
[343:23.25]Do I have resurrection sickness?
[343:24.93]Why is that doing like six damage?
[343:28.42]Oh, I think I'm hitting it in the head.
[343:34.90]You got to upgrade it.
[343:36.08]And I don't have any scaling really anymore.
[344:01.62]Okay, how about one more for the road?
[344:06.66]I can't get off the horse.
[344:19.11]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[344:21.91]Keep an eye out.
[344:22.77]I'll probably... I'm going to stream the DLC again, but just not in the immediate future.
[344:27.89]I am probably going to leave this character where this character is.
[344:32.29]And if I get the urge to kind of hop back on, play some more DLC, I will keep this character exactly where it is.
[344:38.07]I have been playing for a few days and I got to get back into... I got to get back into...
[344:51.94]Let's see, what do I want to... Let's see.
[344:59.95]These things have been terrible the whole time, haven't they?
[345:03.75]They look good, though.
[345:05.97]Yeah, get back in the swing of things.
[345:07.69]It's been actually really fun streaming.
[345:09.37]Hopefully people have been having fun hanging out.
[345:12.37]Good to see you all again.
[345:15.11]Until next time, whenever that is, not going to be six months.
[345:19.93]Don't worry.
[345:20.43]I am enjoying the streaming, especially the kind of low expectation environment where I'm just kind of chilling.
[345:29.64]It's fun.
[345:30.34]I'm enjoying it.
[345:31.90]It's not going to be like a year.
[345:34.68]It'll be the DLC again at some point.
[345:37.54]Yeah.
[345:40.42]Thanks for watching for one day only.
[345:44.13]You are painfully close to that weapon.
[345:46.05]That's funny.
[345:48.12]I'm sure it's probably over there somewhere.
[345:50.68]Have fun with the DLC.
[345:51.90]I'm sure over the next few days, even if I don't play, which I might, I might put it up.
[345:58.57]I might put the hat up for a little bit for a few days.
[346:01.63]So I'm imagining you're all going to be having a shitload of fun.
[346:04.53]It's a great game, great experience.
[346:06.75]I'm having fun with it.
[346:07.92]It's insanely hard, but that's what summons are for.
[346:12.88]And that's what, you know, just, you know, if you want to challenge yourself, go for it.
[346:17.68]you want to throw out some summons it's still even hard with the summons in a lot of cases too so I'm looking forward to seeing a ton of content from this I know there's a lot of great um obviously creators that are doing Elden Ring that are amazing at the game I'm looking forward to kind of hopping around and seeing how people are doing especially if I complete it is this an ad no
[346:47.99]I mean, it's a personal endorsement of the video game Elden Ring, but... My performance was a lot better today.
[346:57.33]It was slow in a couple places, but I hope that other people having the performance problems, maybe they get a patch here soon.
[347:06.12]But yeah, take care of yourselves.
[347:07.78]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[347:09.00]Enjoy the game.
[347:11.32]And, um...
[347:13.04]Yeah, it's essentially 100% guaranteed that I will never beat Messmer.
[347:17.02]But that's fine.
[347:17.80]I can watch somebody else do it.
[347:24.36]Alright, see you later.
[347:25.85]Have a good one.
[347:26.55]Take care of yourselves.
[347:31.51]See you later for now.
[347:59.08]you
[348:33.96]you
