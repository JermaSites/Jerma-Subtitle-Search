[09:50.02]Alright, just... I'm getting out.
[09:52.70]I'm getting out.
[09:53.22]I don't trust you.
[09:54.28]I don't trust you.
[09:54.86]No, no.
[09:55.36]Get in.
[09:55.84]I thought you were just going to drive off the edge.

[10:18.54]No, he can't!
[10:21.54]That guy is not having a good day today.
[10:23.38]He just wants... Everyone's just shooting each other.
[10:26.40]I gotta plug my headphones in.
[10:28.74]Because I think I might be reverbing.
[10:31.07]Because I was just too excited to play.
[10:35.27]Where are my headphones?
[10:36.13]I gotta find them.
[10:36.75]Hold on.
[10:37.79]Everyone just wants everyone dead.
[10:43.72]Think about it every night and day.
[10:46.66]Spread my wings and fly away.
[10:49.73]I believe I can soar.
[10:51.87]I see you running through the open door.
[10:56.63]Oh, God.
[10:57.51]Did I crash?
[10:58.99]Oh, no, I crashed!
[11:00.32]No, I didn't.
[11:00.74]No, I didn't.
[11:01.12]I'm good.

[11:02.68]I thought I crashed, but I'm good.
[11:05.70]Oh, I gotta get my headphones out.
[11:09.64]Alright, we're good to go.
[11:11.08]We're good to go.
[11:14.12]So, everyone's in the airport.
[11:15.70]Now it's pretty much just a race to who gets the helicopters.
[11:21.49]I'm sorry.
[11:24.11]I'm sorry.
[11:25.25]No!
[11:26.83]Dodge.

[11:28.91]Oh, give me this P90.
[11:31.46]Oh man, this is a sad day for anybody.
[11:33.80]Coming close to me!
[11:41.49]Alright, I'm safe.
[11:42.93]I need to get... Oh, you know what?
[11:43.79]I gotta get a car.
[11:45.87]I gotta get a car.
[11:46.99]Um, hey, uh, how you doing?
[11:49.73]Please don't kill me?
[11:50.53]Okay, he ran by me.
[11:51.45]Good.
[11:52.99]Hey, this guy's idea of fun is getting inside the helicopter and shooting all the other helicopters so nobody else can get in.
[11:59.27]Oh, you piece of crap.
[12:01.80]Alright, operation take out the guy in the helicopter.
[12:06.98]Operation take out helicopter flyer.
[12:09.87]Find rocket launcher and dispose of.
[12:12.89]I got in the helicopter, we're all good.
[12:17.45]Alright, I'm gonna get over there.
[12:18.73]I'm on my way.
[12:19.80]I'm en route.
[12:22.96]Break that window!
[12:25.80]Oh, this brings back memories when I smashed my face on that guy.
[12:28.46]He's not even moving.
[12:29.72]What is that guy doing?
[12:33.81]Wait, where am I going?
[12:35.27]Aren't the helicopters... Oh, they're right there.
[12:37.79]They're right there, okay.
[12:40.63]Sorry for just... That's a good tactic, man.
[12:42.87]That's alright.
[12:44.81]Alright, who thinks I'm going to make it underneath this plane?

[13:29.14]Why can't it just stay flying?
[13:30.42]What the hell?
[13:33.48]Are you in a helicopter?
[13:34.36]Where are you?
[13:35.04]Hey dude, stop crouching, run.

[13:51.05]Oh, run away.
[13:52.47]I'm not even gonna go in that, dude.
[13:53.57]I'm gonna die the second I get in there.

[14:28.74]I'm good.
[14:30.62]I'm alright.
[14:32.32]Yeah, what's going on?
[14:33.32]I feel like I'm driving a...
[14:36.02]Alright, let me aim it down at the ground.
[14:38.32]Any unsuspecting people I can smash into?
[14:40.98]Alright, there's cops down there.
[14:44.20]Barrage!
[14:45.24]Unleash the fury!
[14:47.84]I'm not killing anybody.
[14:52.54]You know what?
[14:53.00]I'm going kamikaze.
[14:55.01]Oh my god.

[15:06.95]Really.
[15:08.45]I... I'm really gonna puke.
[15:11.79]Did, like, the controls change, or is this lag?
[15:13.90]Oh, no!
[15:17.68]How did I... Well, uh... That's how we get out of a helicopter and... Walk off the, uh, front and... Hey, come pick me up.
[15:32.18]Where I... Oh my god.
[15:35.34]I think, uh, Papa got a brand new bag here.

[15:49.13]I'm such a bad shot.
[15:52.60]I was, like, landing.
[15:54.08]Oh, you were trying to pick me up?
[15:56.68]Oh, I'm sorry.
[15:57.40]I thought you were, like, you were shooting missiles at me.
[15:59.10]I was scared.
[15:59.62]Because you shot a rocket at me.
[16:06.16]I'm conserving the rest of this ammo.
[16:09.01]Let's get out of here.
[16:09.67]We're being shot at to death.
[16:12.33]If that killed me, I was going to be so angry.
[16:15.95]Everyone just spawns and pulls out pistols and they're just shooting each other.
[16:20.29]This is so un-fucking-nice.
[16:23.64]I'm going to kill this guy.
[16:28.62]Get him!
[16:29.38]Get him!
[16:30.14]Oh, I could have sworn.
[16:31.88]This is that dude.
[16:36.65]Do I blame Tom Brady or anybody for Wes Welker?
[16:40.13]No.
[16:40.37]Yeah, I mean, the Patriots didn't really have that.
[16:44.01]It was a pretty much string of luck that they got into the playoffs to begin with, so.
[16:49.45]Good to see him get that far.
[16:51.01]But yeah, go Celtics.
[16:52.11]That's all I got to say.
[16:56.55]Alright, where's Burgah Boy?
[16:57.39]Burgah Boy is the number one target for me right now.
[17:01.20]I think he is... No, you're brown, you're brown.
[17:04.16]He's green.
[17:06.36]You're orange.
[17:08.94]Alright, so stream, Burgah Boy is target number one.
[17:14.13]Look at how mad he is.
[17:15.33]Look at how mad he is.
[17:16.09]I want the whole stream.
[17:17.29]Let's see if we can make him rage quit.
[17:19.11]You guys suck.
[17:25.94]For some reason, I want to save Cordobomb.
[17:28.08]Get in.
[17:28.88]Get in, Burgah Boy.
[17:30.22]We're making it out of here alive.
[17:33.68]Get in, Cordobomb.
[17:35.94]Me and Burgah Boy are going to escape.
[17:38.34]Actually, you know, Burgah Boy... Oh, no.
[17:43.01]Oh, no.
[17:43.53]Oh, I got the P90, man.
[17:45.79]How is he... I just unloaded 70 bullets into that guy.
[17:50.27]What a champion.
[17:51.85]So are we still having a war against Burgah Boy?
[17:53.47]It doesn't seem like it.
[17:54.61]I'm trying to get in a helicopter.
[17:56.65]When I say we, I mean you guys.
[17:59.05]Oh.
[18:00.35]Oh my god!
[18:02.17]Stay with it.
[18:03.79]What was that?
[18:06.43]What on Earth was that?
[18:07.43]That was ridiculous.
[18:08.21]Was that a rocket?
[18:10.23]Holy crap.
[18:12.21]Oh!
[18:15.73]No!
[18:16.53]I want to live!
[18:18.02]I want to live.
[18:19.08]Get me on, like, the Italian scooter.
[18:23.90]Sick driving, says Burgah Boy.
[18:26.20]Oh, here we go.
[18:27.24]Get me on this bike.
[18:28.49]Burgah Boy, you want to get in some helicopters?
[18:32.19]God, Bob.
[18:34.57]Oh, no.
[18:35.53]The stream is counting my deaths.
[18:37.61]I'm up to 11.
[18:40.11]Where'd you go?
[18:44.11]Where are you?
[18:47.69]Get in, Burgah Boy.
[18:48.76]Hey, get on this bike.
[18:51.94]That's a place I don't want to be at.
[18:54.42]Let me get in with you, burger.
[18:56.72]Hey, wait, I want to join with the fun, too.
[18:59.82]There's another helicopter.
[19:01.12]You can't get in.
[19:02.50]I'm trying to hit my head on the blades.
[19:06.38]Oh, hey, let me just get in this helicopter and hit my face on the blades.
[19:09.05]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[19:11.45]Go without me.
[19:12.43]We got a boat.
[19:12.95]Oh, my God.
[19:15.62]I'm getting out of this.
[19:19.62]What was that?
[19:20.50]Perka boy, that's gonna blow up!
[19:22.50]That's gonna blow up!
[19:23.96]What are you doing still driving?
[19:25.23]He jumped out!
[19:26.71]RPG, watch out.
[19:30.59]That was so perfect.
[19:46.41]That was so perfect.
[19:49.14]Oh my god, thank god this is being recorded.
[19:51.86]Because if I didn't get that on tape, I would have been so bad at myself.
[19:58.51]Is that how destroyed he just got?
[20:04.65]He was, like, trying so hard to stay alive, and he just dies.
[20:10.68]You can see, like, the intensity in his, like, jump out of... Hold on, Burgah Boy.
[20:16.60]Oh, my face.
[20:17.74]Hey, let me get in that car with you, Burgah Boy.
[20:19.18]Alright, Jacob, let me get on the back of that scooter.
[20:23.75]Oh, you bastard!
[20:25.35]I was trying to get on the back.
[20:27.47]Oh.
[20:28.81]Oh.
[20:34.15]Everybody that got to see that, that was one of the funniest things I've seen.
[20:37.36]Alright, let's go.
[20:39.26]Oh, wait, alright, get in.
[20:40.50]Get in!
[20:42.40]Get in the car!
[20:43.94]Get in the car!
[20:44.44]Get in the car, quick!
[20:48.95]Alright, who's... oh, the cop's on you, okay.
[20:50.77]Let's go back to the airfield.
[20:54.49]Oh, nice... oh, man!
[20:56.83]Look at this guy.
[20:57.67]That guy just got run over by a cop.
[21:00.13]We almost sandwiched that dude.
[21:07.18]Oh, let's move.
[21:13.16]Alright, let's get in this helicopter.
[21:19.50]Oh, look at that perfect pull-up.
[21:24.52]I got a feeling this guy might turn into a traitor.
[21:26.94]I don't know, I'm scared.
[21:28.88]Oh my god, did you just run into the helicopter?
[21:32.10]Alright, get in.
[21:32.94]Oh, you flipped it!
[21:33.85]You flipped it!
[21:35.61]You flipped it!
[21:36.99]Let me, like, flip it back.
[21:38.03]Can I, like, get back in?
[21:38.93]I'm going the other way.
[21:42.93]Go away.
[21:43.77]Go away.
[21:45.06]These cops are on me.
[21:46.04]No, I'm gonna die from the police!
[21:50.38]Dammit.
[21:53.10]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[21:57.34]I was trying to... Can you, like, get in and flip it over?
[21:58.97]That would be so funny.
[22:00.17]Alright, I'm coming.
[22:03.39]I want to get in the helicopter and I want to just peacefully just fly down and watch some TV, read a book when I'm parachuting down.
[22:14.43]That's all I want.
[22:15.13]That's all I care about.
[22:16.47]I just want to parachute out of the helicopter.
[22:18.75]That's all I want to do.
[22:21.63]Let me aim out this window.
[22:22.67]Get out of town!
[22:25.28]Oh my god, that guy's a shotgun!
[22:26.66]You pulled up in front of the guy with the shotgun.
[22:29.66]Oh, that's more... Chaos.
[22:32.76]Pure chaos.
[22:34.12]Alright, get us to the airfield, quick.
[22:35.45]We got bogeys on us.
[22:40.69]What's going on?
[22:41.61]He's pulling me out of the car!
[22:42.89]He is pulling me out of the car right now.
[22:54.74]Gord Bomb, let me in.
[22:58.25]I'm leaving, you guys.
[23:00.03]I'm getting the hell out of here.
[23:02.89]Thanks, Burgah Boy.
[23:03.59]Appreciate it.
[23:04.71]Alright, hurry up.
[23:05.25]Get in.
[23:05.53]Hurry up.
[23:05.93]Hurry up.
[23:06.45]Hurry up.
[23:08.59]Oh, my God.
[23:09.49]They are unloading on us.
[23:12.79]Jeez.
[23:15.37]I love how this is just a race.
[23:18.91]All this is is just who can get in the helicopter.
[23:23.59]What is that cop doing?
[23:25.03]Freak.
[23:27.79]He's a bad guy.
[23:28.37]He's aiming his gun at us.
[23:29.35]Oh man, look at this chaos.
[23:30.75]We got a fight going on over here, boys.
[23:34.26]He's got an RPG, doesn't he?
[23:35.22]Yeah.
[23:37.22]Alright, I'm getting out of there now.
[23:38.38]Oh wait, Burgah Boy, you're dead?
[23:39.66]I'm like sitting in the car with you.
[23:41.04]Who killed you?
[23:44.38]Alright, we... We're at the airfield waiting for a spawn.
[23:48.81]Come on.
[23:49.99]Come on, spawn a copter.
[23:51.67]They're on the air, aren't they?
[23:55.38]Oh, man.
[23:55.78]Everyone really likes shooting.
[23:56.88]Nobody just wants to run cars into each other.
[24:02.01]Where's these helicopters?
[24:04.81]I'm taking cover behind.
[24:05.85]I know someone's going to come and smash into us.
[24:12.07]Oh, yeah.
[24:12.43]Take the cover.
[24:16.65]I'm stuck on the door right now.
[24:19.19]Oh, man.
[24:19.57]Oh, man.
[24:20.15]Oh, man.
[24:21.15]Oh, no.
[24:21.57]No!
[24:22.03]No!
[24:24.16]Alright, at least I... I would have died from that explosion if I didn't die from that explosion.
[24:28.24]I would have died from the... You know what?
[24:30.62]I'm going this way.
[24:31.88]I got a plan.
[24:32.42]There's police helicopters here.
[24:33.74]I got a plan.
[24:35.14]You know, I have a plan.
[24:36.72]And it's gonna work.
[24:38.20]Oh, it is absolutely gonna work.
[24:40.16]Maybe it won't.
[24:40.84]Probably not.
[24:44.16]Run, run, run, run, run.
[24:45.34]I'll take the cop cop.
[24:48.06]I'll take the cop cop.
[24:50.00]For those of you asking in the stream, this is Episodes from Liberty City.
[24:53.19]It's the expansion of GTA 4.
[24:55.47]We're playing The Ballad of Gay Tony.
[24:57.75]And if you want to join... Did you just see that helicopter crash?
[25:01.67]That was... Who is in this helicopter is the real question.
[25:07.23]So if you want to join, my name on here is Jerma with four A's.
[25:13.61]And just join the game I'm in once you send a friend request.
[25:16.62]You should be able to.

[25:22.59]Oh my goodness.
[25:23.95]That is a missile coming at us.
[25:28.42]I'm getting out.
[25:30.02]Of course I have three stars.
[25:31.64]Fantastic.
[25:35.12]Alright, let's set up shop here.
[25:36.80]Oh, I gotta add Zeus.
[25:40.42]Where are you, Zeus?
[25:43.23]Oh, not the back.
[25:44.71]Oh my god!
[25:46.90]I'm in the middle of inviting somebody to the game and I just hear a crash and you're next to me.
[25:55.70]And invite to game.
[25:59.36]Alright.
[26:01.49]Okay.
[26:04.21]What am I doing?
[26:05.53]I'm just like creeping.
[26:08.75]Nah, I'm waiting for a copter.
[26:09.71]I'm waiting for a helicopter.
[26:13.01]There's no way I'm going to get it.
[26:14.37]Oh my god.
[26:16.91]Alright, I'm getting in.
[26:19.25]Look at all these people everywhere.
[26:20.77]I'm going to do plan B. Look at the mini-map.
[26:23.67]Look at how many police are here.
[26:24.63]Look at the mini-map.
[26:25.87]Look at the mini-map.
[26:27.19]That's ridiculous.
[26:29.27]Oh, I just barely... I just barely almost got in there.
[26:33.84]Alright, new plan.
[26:35.70]I'm doing plan B. I am absolutely... What was plan B?
[26:40.86]Plan B is to go get the helicopter...
[26:45.46]Oh, here comes the SWAT team.
[26:46.52]Good thing they're not coming after me.
[26:48.90]How tall... Somebody's already doing plan B. Somebody's already doing plan B. What did he say it was?
[26:55.17]To go base jump.
[26:56.97]And go float over here.
[27:00.99]Who is this?
[27:02.07]Is nobody even in here?
[27:05.09]I'm taking this.
[27:06.49]Give me that.
[27:07.15]Give it to me.
[27:08.87]Get out of there.
[27:10.56]Oh man, that was bad.
[27:11.38]I'm sorry, Mr. Ambulance Driver.
[27:13.18]You just try to help people.
[27:14.24]I'm such a bad person.
[27:15.10]I'm sorry.
[27:21.30]Alright, turn that off.
[27:22.04]That's going to get annoying.
[27:23.99]Alright, let's see.
[27:25.75]I need to go right here.
[27:29.07]Why am I flipped over?
[27:30.01]I just rammed you.
[27:31.65]You're on fire.
[27:32.71]Oh my god, you're on fire.
[27:33.61]You're on fire.
[27:34.11]You're on fire.
[27:35.09]No!
[27:36.25]Get away from that cop!
[27:38.45]Give me this one.
[27:39.95]No!
[27:42.77]Give me this, give me this, give me this.
[27:43.77]Don't drive away!
[27:45.63]Did I get him?
[27:47.05]No, I didn't.
[27:47.75]Come here.
[27:49.06]Come here!
[27:49.50]This dude's lagging.
[27:54.06]I got away.
[27:55.28]Alright, let's see if the plan works.
[27:56.72]Come pick me up.
[27:58.38]Turn around.
[27:59.72]Alright, come here.
[28:03.78]I wasn't going to run into you, I promise.
[28:06.34]Oh, I'm in the backseat.
[28:08.57]Alright.
[28:08.91]Driving Miss Daisy.
[28:09.77]Driving Miss Stealth.
[28:10.81]Alright.
[28:12.88]Hopefully this building is tall enough so we can, like, base jump off of it and fly into the action.
[28:21.46]That's a right hand... Oh, jeez.
[28:24.72]Please exit the vehicle and watch your hands and feet.
[28:27.14]Thank you for riding in Jerma, the worst car driver in the world.
[28:29.66]Thank you so much.
[28:30.36]No, don't shoot me.
[28:33.14]Oh, you're going to blow it up.
[28:35.22]I see.
[28:35.64]I see.
[28:36.63]No, I'm shooting all the tires.
[28:37.75]Uh, Woodadelic, this will be on YouTube.
[28:39.83]It will.
[28:40.69]The whole thing will be on YouTube.
[28:42.19]Probably tomorrow.
[28:44.69]Alright, we gotta get a new car.
[28:48.02]We need a new car.
[28:52.06]Oh, somebody's already doing the parachute.
[28:53.82]Where are the cars?
[28:55.18]I found a motorcycle.
[28:58.38]Oh, jeez.
[29:01.89]Is this the guy?
[29:03.61]Why is he... Oh, get this guy!
[29:04.99]Shoot him!
[29:05.45]Shoot this guy!
[29:08.55]Shoot him!
[29:09.87]Kill him!
[29:12.54]Kill him!
[29:13.12]Kill him!
[29:15.66]Alright, I got a cop.
[29:19.08]Where am I going?
[29:20.20]Alright, I'm right there.
[29:20.86]We're right here.
[29:23.56]Oh, here's the guy that was shooting us.
[29:25.18]Let's back into him!
[29:30.05]I will run you over as many times as I have to.
[29:37.96]Alright, let's get out of here.
[29:41.74]I'm going to do that base jump.
[29:43.06]It's gonna happen.
[29:47.45]Turn the corner.
[29:49.35]Here we go.
[29:51.51]Oh, this is a really small building.
[29:52.89]This is gonna... Is there a taxi I can call?
[29:55.79]Actually, that's not that small.
[29:57.35]I don't think they have taxis in multiplayer.
[29:59.78]Aww.
[30:00.70]Dude.
[30:01.94]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[30:03.60]Alright.
[30:04.54]So, how high up am I?
[30:06.08]Actually, it is pretty damn high.
[30:09.11]Alright, where's the action going on?
[30:11.69]Over here.
[30:13.07]So I gotta jump off this side.
[30:16.12]And... let's go!
[30:19.10]Open!
[30:19.44]Open!
[30:19.72]Alright, let's see if I can, like, float into the madness.
[30:26.73]That guy's a helicopter.
[30:29.43]Floating on the helicopter, boy.
[30:30.45]I'm sure that'll be pretty easy.
[30:33.35]Ah, look at how relaxing this is.
[30:36.79]Just floating around, relaxing with my friends.
[30:42.08]Oh, hey Stealth!
[30:43.32]I made it!
[30:45.04]That was fun!
[30:45.72]Woohoo!
[30:47.90]Let's go do that again.
[30:50.54]Except, let's not.
[30:51.26]I want to get on this.
[30:51.98]I want to get on the bike.
[30:53.68]I want to get on the bike.
[30:56.64]I... I'm trying to... The guy just flew!
[30:59.53]What?!
[31:01.57]He's right next to me.
[31:02.79]What is going on?! !
[31:07.61]He was still in the riding position.
[31:10.26]He jumped up and he was like, oh, nothing's going on here.
[31:12.44]I'm just like, still riding the bike.
[31:15.68]What the hell was that?
[31:18.58]Oh, I love how many glitches are in this game.
[31:23.60]Oh, jeez.
[31:24.96]Oh my god, I can't control it.
[31:26.84]Oh, who wants to play baseball?
[31:30.84]We got enough people to play baseball.
[31:32.70]We got like, yeah, there's enough people in here.
[31:34.58]Alright, I'm gonna be the pitcher.
[31:37.79]I'll be the batter.
[31:40.66]Let's play grenade baseball.
[31:42.44]Do we have any grenades?
[31:46.64]I'm the batter.
[31:47.74]Alright, ready?
[31:49.06]So I'm going to throw the ball.
[31:51.71]Alright, did you hit it?
[31:52.39]Oh, I hit it.
[31:52.71]Boom.
[31:53.35]Oh, look at, wow, it went so far.
[31:55.81]Look at how far it went.
[31:57.21]Around first base.
[31:58.25]Go to second.
[31:59.31]Oh, no, I got to throw about.
[32:01.15]Oh, I didn't get him.
[32:03.96]Oh, no, the ball got thrown in.
[32:05.84]Oh, he's still safe.
[32:07.85]Here you are.
[32:08.69]You got a triple.
[32:09.27]You got a triple.
[32:11.29]Alright, ghost man on third.
[32:12.93]Oh, okay.
[32:13.44]Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[32:14.90]You have to leave the car.
[32:16.42]Oh, but it's a ghost man.
[32:18.40]Yeah, but then you have to get in the car and drive to home plate.
[32:23.92]So you get over there.
[32:28.35]So you get over there.
[32:30.03]Someone in the stream just wrote, the crowd goes wild.
[32:32.53]Alright, so here we go.
[32:34.33]Ready?
[32:35.99]I pitched it.
[32:37.34]Alright, now go run to first base!
[32:41.78]Missed.
[32:42.84]Oh god, there's another guy here.
[32:44.88]We're playing baseball, dude.
[32:46.16]Oh, it's Zeus.
[32:47.08]Oh yeah, we're playing baseball.
[32:48.66]Do you want to play baseball?
[32:51.17]My runner got home.
[32:52.51]I got a single.
[32:53.69]Zeus, you're up.
[32:58.33]Alright, baseball is over.
[32:59.53]I win.
[33:00.53]Because you didn't get home.
[33:04.38]What's my, what do I, what do I want?
[33:05.96]I just shot you in the toe.
[33:08.77]Alright, run home!
[33:10.43]To your real home!
[33:13.07]What, uh, what, is that a Bad News Bears joke?
[33:19.05]Alright, hey, hold on.
[33:25.37]Oh, let's get in the tanker, let's get in the tanker.
[33:28.63]Please tell me those explode.
[33:31.47]Please tell me those.
[33:32.33]Please tell me.
[33:32.75]No, no, no.
[33:33.23]Don't shoot it.
[33:33.59]Don't shoot it.
[33:33.97]Is it connected?
[33:34.99]No, it's not connected.
[33:36.13]I don't even think we can connect it.
[33:37.23]This is on GTA San Andreas.
[33:39.43]They definitely explode, though.
[33:40.51]For sure.
[33:41.09]Oh.
[33:41.23]Let's see if I can, like, connect them.
[33:45.15]Nah, you can't connect them.
[33:46.89]This is gonna be a massive... You're gonna die.
[33:49.17]You're going to die in, like, two seconds.
[33:52.72]The fire's gone.
[33:53.40]Oh, my God.
[33:54.38]Look at this Burgah Boy to save the day.
[33:57.72]He did... Wow, what a pro.
[33:59.92]Let me get in.
[34:02.07]No, I want to get in this.
[34:03.77]Dude, he just flipped!
[34:13.30]Alright, Burgah Boy, go as high as you can.
[34:19.22]Dude, he just flipped... He just flipped that car.
[34:24.34]That's like a five million pound car.
[34:28.13]And he just flipped it over.
[34:31.76]I still have my parachute, right?
[34:33.24]I hope so.
[34:38.66]I love how you just came out of nowhere, Burgah Boy.
[34:40.68]That was, like, amazing.
[34:47.39]I can't believe that thing flipped my janker.
[34:49.49]That's why I laughed so hard.
[34:54.51]Oh, Burgah Boy, you're going to waste all your ammo.
[34:55.97]Alright, ready?
[34:57.45]Here we go.
[34:58.76]I am going to jump out of the... I'm going to parachute.
[35:01.34]I'm going to parachute and see how long I can parachute for.
[35:04.87]So keep going up.
[35:09.49]Shoot!
[35:10.35]Oh, shoot at all the people down there.
[35:12.79]Wow, we are up really high.
[35:14.05]I think this is as high as we can go.
[35:15.67]Thanks, Burgah Boy!
[35:16.53]Woohoo!
[35:19.77]Oh, yeah.
[35:21.05]Thanks, Burgah Boy!
[35:22.05]Woohoo!
[35:22.69]So I'm going to watch and see where Burgah Boy goes.
[35:28.04]So, I'll tell you a story while I'm parachuting.
[35:29.89]It's like story time.
[35:32.07]So, uh, one time... Let's see how long it takes before I can finish this story.
[35:36.77]Uh, one time I was, uh, on Halloween.
[35:39.67]I was having a good time as the Ninja Turtles.
[35:42.51]And this story's really going nowhere.
[35:44.22]I just want to try and talk and see how long it takes for me to land.
[35:46.48]Let's see.
[35:51.74]Oh, more talking.
[35:54.90]I love all these people...
[35:59.56]I feel the same way.
[36:03.04]I feel the same way.
[36:03.90]Whoever was just talking in a different language.
[36:09.11]Who's even talking?
[36:24.80]I just heard a language I am not familiar with.
[36:29.22]Wow.
[36:31.10]So, um... Who thinks... Place your bets.
[36:35.14]Am I going to die right now?
[36:37.70]Am I going to die right now when I land?
[36:39.36]We'll find out.
[36:43.56]Somebody is now chasing me.
[36:46.00]And I have a feeling they're going to take me out.
[36:49.49]Oh, it's Burgah Boy.
[36:51.43]He's, like, patrolling the skies.
[36:53.11]He's, like, keeping you safe.
[36:54.71]He's patrolling the airwaves.
[36:58.65]There's a helicopter pad right here.
[37:00.71]Why did I not come here to begin with?
[37:03.61]It's like a secret helicopter pad, does anybody know about this?
[37:07.55]There's no helicopter here!
[37:10.69]Hey, look at that!
[37:12.15]Two minutes, that took two minutes, oh my god, what a long time.
[37:17.51]Epic landing.
[37:20.27]Let's just jump over here.
[37:22.89]And, okay, I thought I was going to die, that was scary.
[37:27.58]You're on the run.
[37:28.58]You're at the airport.
[37:29.68]I know.
[37:30.00]I'm fine.
[37:31.04]I'm fine.
[37:32.24]I'm fine.
[37:33.50]I'm flying the big one.
[37:34.52]I feel like the big one has a little more control.
[37:39.61]Who's that?
[37:40.03]Is that Burgah Boy?
[37:41.97]It is.
[37:42.25]Hold on.
[37:47.31]Don't take off yet.
[37:47.91]I want to get an order.
[37:58.08]I just hit him with the blades.
[38:10.86]I'm sorry, Burgah Boy.
[38:12.82]I'm sorry.
[38:14.81]I'm so sorry.
[38:17.05]I had to do it.
[38:19.83]I don't think he died.
[38:25.13]I think he's still alive.
[38:26.93]I thought you'd kill him.
[38:28.13]Oh, I killed him.
[38:30.49]I'm going way too... Dude, can you imagine if you landed from that high up?
[38:45.79]If you landed, like, flat on your stomach?
[38:48.66]Dude, your insides would just explode.
[38:53.11]Oh god, that would be so horrible.
[38:55.57]You would not want to be at that crime scene cleaning that up.
[39:01.33]What?
[39:02.49]What the hell was that?
[39:04.68]That guy just... Okay, I'll take the car, fine.
[39:08.82]Oh, that guy's got an automatic gun.
[39:15.37]Goodbye.
[39:18.25]Turn this way.
[39:18.91]Alright.
[39:20.81]I'm gonna play in cinematic mode for the remainder of the game.
[39:31.43]Look at this, like, oh, it's a trailer.
[39:33.99]I wonder how long I can survive.
[39:35.25]Oh my god!
[39:40.89]I hope everyone in the stream just saw that.
[39:44.49]I'm trying to, like, hit you.
[39:46.37]Dude, on my screen, you just... HOW AM I STILL AVA... HOW AM I STILL... I can't play this game for more than an hour, man, and my head starts to hurt from laughing at, like, the nonsense.
[40:05.57]Michael Bay presen... WHAT?
[40:07.39]What the... What is that?
[40:09.03]What is this?
[40:10.41]What happened to us?
[40:11.11]What is going on?
[40:14.06]What is going on?
[40:14.94]Why am I like a teddy bear, like hippopotamus?
[40:27.29]Why are we like a parade float?
[40:29.25]Hey, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.
[40:35.35]Get in here.
[40:37.07]Get in here.
[40:41.02]We gotta get another person in this car.
[40:45.22]Zeus is right above us.
[40:46.40]Zeus, get in this car.
[40:49.34]Take the other seat in here.
[40:54.29]Somebody please get in there so we can have like a sodium can parade flow.
[40:57.94]Alright, let's just try.
[41:00.96]Let's just try.
[41:02.72]Let's just try.
[41:05.30]When I turn... Alright, before I... Before I get into uncontrollable laughter.
[41:12.96]When I turn, watch the heads go back... Oh, the car stalled.
[41:20.08]Alright, get...
[41:23.70]Hey guys, it's Pauly the Hippopotamus.
[41:28.24]Let's play Hungry Hungry Hippos.

[41:31.04]Ready?
[41:31.28]Just hit control.
[41:34.28]Come here, come here.
[41:34.96]Wait, come here, come here.
[41:35.96]So I'm going to stand right here.
[41:36.96]You stand opposite me.
[41:38.36]And then just keep hitting control over and over again.
[41:41.04]Hungry Hungry Hippos.
[41:41.88]Ready?
[41:42.10]It's Hungry Hungry Hippos!
[41:52.61]Oh my god.
[41:53.51]Alright, Zeus is right here.
[41:56.27]Alright, Zeus.
[41:58.95]Oh, Zeus is a normal human.
[42:00.63]Why is he normal?
[42:02.58]He must have died.
[42:03.28]Oh, well.
[42:04.46]Alright, get in this new car.
[42:05.82]Get in this, like, Camry.
[42:09.32]I love how the cop just pulled up.
[42:12.80]Oh my god.
[42:13.38]What is happening?
[42:14.18]How did this happen?
[42:15.52]Are you guys in?
[42:17.88]Look at our head.
[42:18.52]Alright, watch the heads when I turn.
[42:21.24]This is the funniest damn thing ever.
[42:25.08]I gotta get some speed.
[42:25.98]I gotta get some speed.
[42:28.87]I gotta get some speed.
[42:29.83]Hold on.
[42:30.39]Watch the heads.
[42:31.95]Here we go.
[42:32.39]Ready?
[42:33.89]Alright, come on.
[42:34.51]Get out of this mode.
[42:35.19]I don't want this mode.
[42:35.93]I want, like, the head mode.
[42:36.83]I don't want to go too fast.
[42:39.05]Oh, there's a spirit.
[42:42.43]Look at right here.
[42:43.61]Oh!
[42:46.59]How come it keeps glitching out?
[42:47.63]I wanna see, like, the heads tilt.
[42:51.63]This is the dumbest thing ever.
[42:53.99]How did this happen?
[42:56.05]I don't know.
[42:56.49]There must be an admin in here.
[43:00.15]Look at the heads, like... We look like Barney.
[43:09.40]I feel like... Alright, look at what this looks like right now.
[43:13.21]This looks like America's, like, most wanted videotapes.
[43:16.89]And it's like, what kind of criminals are we?
[43:19.53]You know what I mean?
[43:20.15]It's like, look at the criminals driving away in their crazy costumes.
[43:24.20]Like, they're trying to hide their identities.
[43:26.74]Wait, what button do you press?
[43:28.58]It's V until you get there.
[43:32.85]Alright, now here's the real kicker.
[43:34.09]Oh god, I'm out of control.
[43:35.70]Alright, this is gonna be... I'm gonna laugh uncontrollably at this.
[43:39.48]Alright, Zeus, get in.
[43:40.30]Get in here.
[43:40.96]America's most... America's most wanted, like, the hungry, the hungry, hungry hippos.
[43:46.10]They robbed a liquor store.
[43:47.53]Like a helicopter, like, view of us.
[43:49.85]Oh!
[43:50.01]Oh no!
[43:50.91]What was... Did he just kill us all?
[43:54.45]Yeah.
[43:54.95]Oh, now I don't have my hungry, hungry hippo head.
[43:57.13]Oh no.
[44:02.71]That was awesome.
[44:05.05]Oh my goodness gracious.
[44:07.72]Give us back our hungry, hungry airpods.
[44:12.98]This is so funny.
[44:14.88]Alright, so... Oh, you should not shoot at the tires, that's our only vehicle.
[44:22.88]I think that's a good note to end on, to be honest.
[44:27.02]Seriously, that was... I don't know how that happened.
[44:29.68]There was probably an admin in here or something.
[44:31.39]I have no idea, but that was absolutely hysterical.
[44:35.39]Hippo burgers.
[44:37.29]Alright, let me get on that bike.
[44:38.97]Alright, wait, wait.
[44:39.97]Here's how we're going to end it.
[44:41.01]Here's how we're going to end it, guys.
[44:42.61]Ready?
[44:43.33]Everybody, everybody get into where we're standing right now.
[44:46.13]We're going to have a giant boxing match.
[44:48.71]And the last man standing wins.
[44:51.41]So don't, not yet.
[44:52.15]No, not yet.
[44:52.77]Take the knife.
[44:53.17]Put the knife away.
[44:54.70]Put the knife away.
[44:56.80]Put the knife away.
[44:57.88]So everyone get to where we're standing.
[44:59.30]No knives.
[45:00.60]Only boxing.
[45:02.40]So, if we all, if we, ready?
[45:04.47]This is how it's going to end.
[45:05.39]Make sure we get everybody here.
[45:06.79]So, this is how, wait, not yet, not yet.
[45:09.43]Alright, wait, Bergamot, stop it!
[45:12.55]Bergamot!
[45:13.09]I don't think he's even, like, watching the stream.
[45:16.15]Alright, ready?
[45:18.99]So, three, two, one, boxing fight, go!
[45:34.41]Joey, you just disappeared.
[45:36.05]I'm over here punching people.
[45:39.07]Oh, I'm going down.
[45:40.55]I'm going down.
[45:42.15]No, I want to run.
[45:43.00]I want to get on top of the car and, like, jump and punch.
[45:52.02]People are, like, running away.
[45:53.50]Oh, it's because they're low on health.
[45:59.67]I love how nobody's even grunting or talking, so it's just like silence, we're only like... They're just like... Dude, gang up on Burgah Boy, don't let him win!
[46:12.80]Don't let Burgah Boy win!
[46:14.85]Gang up on... Burgah Boy's dead!
[46:18.25]Oh, I'm dead.
[46:18.87]Uh-oh.
[46:19.69]He has full health, and I have none.
[46:21.63]Oh, did MLC_St3alth just win?
[46:23.63]Or did this guy win?
[46:24.47]No, it's him.
[46:26.47]Oh, and your winner, hissinggem2788.
[46:29.87]Congratulations, you won the punching round.
[46:32.23]And you know what you win?
[46:32.92]A knife to the face!
[46:35.24]Oh, now they're bringing out guns.
[46:42.34]Oh, god.
[46:45.99]Oh, man.
[46:47.37]That was awesome.
[46:52.61]That was amazing.
[46:57.49]Oh, so if you missed it, if you missed some of the... We've been playing for just about an hour now.
[47:02.56]Oh, if you missed... If you just got here or something, this is all going to be on YouTube tomorrow.
[47:06.84]So... There were some hysterical things that happened in this.
[47:12.38]Like, if you just joined us, you're going to want to watch it tomorrow.
[47:15.60]What the heck?
[47:17.31]Alright, it's time for some QWOP.
[47:20.55]QWOP.
[47:26.53]So what was my final death count?
[47:28.51]25?
[47:28.53]Oh god.
[47:30.57]Wait, does it say?
[47:32.01]No, they've been counting in the stream.
[47:33.81]I'm just looking over and glancing over and seeing.
[47:40.10]Alright, thanks a lot for playing, guys.
[47:41.26]If you played, I'll probably do this again.
[47:43.10]This was actually pretty damn fun.
[47:45.64]Thanks for coming.
[47:46.68]If you joined into the game, into the session.
[47:48.88]So now we're going to play some QWOP.
[47:52.37]And yeah, thanks so much, guys.
[47:53.77]Oh!
[47:59.74]That was a shot in the face.
[48:01.10]Alright, let me pull up.
[48:04.55]How do I get out of here?
[48:05.33]Alright, it's going to be a black screen until I get QWOP loaded.
[48:11.37]Q-W-O-P.
[48:12.99]QWOP, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.
[48:16.93]Hey, yo.
[48:20.56]I love Liberty City.
[48:24.54]QWOP is a flash game.
[48:28.18]it's a flash game where you have to use QW and then OP to run and it is incredibly difficult.
[48:37.18]So screens, actually screens probably not going to go black.
[48:39.12]It's probably going to be just my background.
[48:41.73]Yep.
[48:42.67]Just my desktop background.
[48:47.77]Alright, let me pull up some QWOP.
[48:54.81]Let me make sure the stream thing is there.
[49:00.39]Oh, man, that was funny.
[49:04.31]That was so damn funny.
[49:07.83]Q-W-O-P, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.
[49:12.01]QWOP.
[49:16.05]I'm going to make it so it's just the QWOP screen, because that's more fun that way.
[49:22.61]Black screen.
[49:25.56]Screen region.
[49:27.73]The co-op screen.
[49:28.97]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:31.69]How are ya?
[49:34.24]And let's play.
[49:36.92]So the goal... Let me put myself a goal for this match.
[49:41.50]This round.
[49:45.28]Slug.
[49:45.86]Slug.
[49:46.97]I'd say 10 meters.
[49:49.71]I'm gonna try and slug my way to at least 10 to 30.
[49:51.81]Here we go.
[50:01.91]Hold on a second, I gotta... I gotta get my mixer here.
[50:06.63]This is gonna be a little too loud.
[50:07.93]There we go.
[50:09.05]Alright, let's move!
[50:12.74]Yeah, TF2, I will do a TF2 stream next week, absolutely.
[50:16.12]But tonight, I was just running... I had a lot of work I had to do, so I just wanted to unwind with a little bit of GTA, and that was a lot of fun.
[50:24.42]And can I play League of Legends?
[50:25.54]That was one of the questions somebody was asking.
[50:27.82]Me and Stealth actually have played League of Legends.
[50:30.52]For like five minutes.
[50:33.32]I'm just not that good, though.
[50:35.06]I'm such a noob at that game.
[50:37.76]And that's... Oh, no!
[50:40.03]God!
[50:41.19]No, that didn't count.
[50:41.83]That didn't count.
[50:42.81]That didn't count.
[50:46.21]This will, though.
[50:47.09]Oh, come on.
[50:49.81]Co-op.
[50:50.25]Co-op.
[50:50.69]Co-op.
[50:51.15]I just finished GTA, Mr. ADZY.
[50:55.13]If you want to check out my YouTube channel tomorrow, it'll be there, the whole thing.
[50:59.17]Go!
[50:59.93]Go!
[51:00.77]Go!
[51:04.05]I'm actually starting to kind of understand how this works.
[51:09.05]Oh my god, how did I still... Wow.
[51:12.03]Okay, I'm good.
[51:14.82]And Diablo, I'm going to be... This is for those of you guys that are still here.
[51:18.76]Diablo 3, I'm going to be doing a lot of live streaming of that game.
[51:23.89]A lot of Diablo 3 streams are going to happen.
[51:27.31]So be on the lookout for those.
[51:28.45]Alright, I've got to get to 30.
[51:31.18]Come on, 30 meters.
[51:33.06]Use your slug powers from the slug god of Sluggington.
