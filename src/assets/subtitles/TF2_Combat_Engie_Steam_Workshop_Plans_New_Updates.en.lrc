[00:08.29]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.66]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:13.46]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer with the Widowmaker, the Pistol, and the Gunslinger.
[00:20.58]Vintage Gunslinger.
[00:22.43]This is also gonna be on King of the Hill Nucleus.
[00:25.39]One of my favorite Engineer maps.
[00:26.93]My favorite combat Engineer maps.
[00:28.73]Let me rephrase that.
[00:30.07]But this is a great gameplay.
[00:31.25]I kill a lot of people with this Widowmaker.
[00:34.18]And this thing has really taken over my primary slot choice.
[00:38.12]I used to always, 100% of the time, run around with the Frontier Justice.
[00:43.45]That's not the case anymore.
[00:45.05]I put the Frontier Justice on now when I have a big sentry, and of course I use the Widowmaker when I have the Mini-Sentry.
[00:51.74]But it's not really, that's not absolute.
[00:54.28]I do, I change it up every now and then.
[00:55.90]You know me, I'm a freak.
[00:58.76]So what I want to talk about right now in this gameplay is I want to talk about the new update that's coming out and a couple other things.
[01:06.12]I have a call to the community, I guess you could say, and I'll get into that in a second, but let's talk about the update.
[01:13.60]So Meet the Pyro is coming out.
[01:15.86]Nobody knows when.
[01:16.88]It's just coming out in 2012.
[01:18.84]That's all we know.
[01:19.80]We don't know anything else.
[01:21.07]But they have a screenshot.
[01:22.93]And it looks like the pyro has lit an entire building on fire.
[01:26.45]And are you guys as excited about this as I am?
[01:29.91]Because they took a long time to make Meet the Medic.
[01:33.75]And it feels like this is a joke.
[01:36.21]It took them like 7,500 years to make Meet the Medic.
[01:39.61]And now right after Meet the Medic comes out, less than a year later, they're going to tell us they're coming out with Meet the Pyro?
[01:45.02]And this always gets me thinking, and I want to know what you guys have to say about this as well, so feel free to chime in in the comments section.
[01:53.02]So this is the last Meet the Team video.
[01:55.71]What's next?
[01:57.09]What are they going to do next?
[01:58.53]They don't have anything to dangle out in front of us like a carrot on a string.
[02:02.83]This is the last one, guys.
[02:04.68]And actually, I read somewhere that after this Meet the Team video, they are going to make a movie.
[02:11.04]like a 40 minute long meet the whole entire team video or something like that, that Robin Walker has stated that they have not really turned down that idea.
[02:21.21]And I'm just thinking, how amazing would that be?
[02:24.13]How insane would it be if they did like a straight to DVD release of Team Fortress 2, the movie?
[02:31.13]Oh my God.
[02:32.22]If I had millions of dollars, I would finance that movie right now.
[02:36.12]I would send a check to Valve for $40 million so they could make that movie.
[02:42.46]Like really.
[02:43.87]So transitioning with that, we're going to get a bunch of new items, I guess, too, in 2012.
[02:47.41]So it's just really exciting across the board.
[02:50.98]But my call to the community is, I want to do something for the Steam Workshop.
[02:57.04]I want to get in touch with a really, really good modeler, somebody that knows what they're doing, and I have a bunch of ideas that I really do think could make it into the game.
[03:07.63]Especially one idea in particular, and it's not a weapon, but I won't get into the details with that, but the reason why this is a call to the community
[03:16.71]is if you guys know a really, really good modeler, I mean, I'm talking somebody that is like on the pro level, that really knows what they're doing, and would love to do something like this, shoot me a YouTube PM and give me their info, or even if it's you, let's talk, because I really have some funny ideas that could really make it into the game.
[03:35.38]So all of that aside, Team Fortress 2 is going places in 2012.
[03:40.74]I can't wait to see what they do next, guys.
[03:42.88]It wasn't that long ago.
[03:44.08]It was only probably four months ago when I said, in a commentary, I said, Team Fortress 2, I think, is dying.
[03:50.47]They haven't come out with an update.
[03:51.93]They're not doing a whole lot for the community anymore.
[03:54.45]And then, bang, look at this.
[03:56.77]All this new crazy stuff is in the pipeline, and...
[03:59.87]It's great, because this is one of the best games I've ever played, and I'm sure a lot of you guys will agree with that.
[04:05.49]So it really is awesome to see one of my favorite games, and a lot of yours as well, to still be getting this attention that it deserves, and I don't even know when they're going to stop now.
[04:15.56]But it is exciting, exciting stuff.
[04:18.46]So got backstabbed right there in the gameplay.
[04:21.06]This was almost a one-life gameplay.
[04:23.49]So I was a little, I was like, oh god, I almost had another one life, but it's okay.
[04:28.13]We end up winning the game right now.
[04:29.71]They get on the point, but it's not a big deal.
[04:32.07]Only 10 seconds left to go.
[04:34.32]Drop your sentry gun right here, your Mini-Sentry, because at this chaotic point when everyone's rushing over here to try and get on this, no one is really paying attention that there's a sentry gun here.
[04:44.67]But this is going to be the end of the gameplay, guys.
[04:46.83]Thank you so much for watching.
[04:48.55]I really do appreciate it.
[04:49.93]And remember, if you know anybody that is a computer graphics modeler, or if you are, shoot me a PM, we'll talk.
[04:57.08]But that's it, guys.
[04:58.00]I'll see you all soon.
[04:59.12]And take care, everybody.
