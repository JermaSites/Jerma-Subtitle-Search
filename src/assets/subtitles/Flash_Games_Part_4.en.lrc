[00:05.94]Workout today.
[00:07.66]Working out today.
[00:09.86]How's everybody doing?
[00:12.10]Good afternoon.
[00:14.48]Running around.
[00:16.80]Maybe ran a little too much.
[00:19.27]Up and down the stairs.
[00:24.37]I noticed what time it was.
[00:27.01]Oh my God, I'm pressing buttons.
[00:28.47]I noticed what time it was about maybe six or seven minutes ago and I was kind of not ready.
[00:34.80]So I just had to freak out and I ran around the house.
[00:37.38]I got to get coffee.
[00:38.78]I've got to have something to eat.
[00:40.42]I've got to pee.
[00:41.46]I sometimes got to do the other one.
[00:43.58]Sometimes, not every day, maybe like a few times a week.
[00:46.69]Maybe like once or twice a week.
[00:49.15]Give me some break.
[00:50.03]Give me a slack here.
[00:58.58]He's very, very constipated.
[01:03.68]Karma cares about his life more than he cares about us.
[01:06.55]He hates us.
[01:09.07]He hates us.
[01:12.59]This guy had to go to the bathroom.
[01:13.99]He hates us.
[01:18.61]Once a week exclusivity.
[01:22.15]You know, that's a good point.
[01:23.59]Do you guys have...
[01:27.48]I care.
[01:28.24]I care.
[01:28.76]True.
[01:29.22]He does.
[01:29.90]No, I don't.
[01:30.28]No, no, no, I can't.
[01:33.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:34.22]Like, hold on.
[01:34.96]Wait a second.
[01:37.12]I'm saying he hates this thing.
[01:38.88]I don't.
[01:41.12]I was referring to he hates us.
[01:43.14]No, I don't.
[01:43.96]I read that.
[01:44.56]And then I read the accidental next one, which is he cares.
[01:48.03]And then I said, no, I don't.
[01:49.09]Don't worry.
[01:50.05]Don't worry.
[01:52.59]It was a fucked up slip, whatever they call them.
[01:57.60]No, I don't.

[05:24.33]Why are these so popular?
[05:26.91]This is the most popular game ever.
[05:28.21]Should I play this one?
[05:28.95]I'm gonna play the original Bee Ice Cream.
[05:34.46]Because this is the top game on the whole website.
[05:39.47]Right?
[05:43.25]I got it.
[05:43.61]This is the worst game.
[05:49.24]How is the worst game the top game?

[06:09.82]What the fuck?
[06:10.34]What about Bee Ice Cream 2?
[06:11.31]Please wait.

[07:17.33]You can give me your credit card info.
[07:22.47]What do I do?
[07:23.51]Is this Bee Ice Cream?
[07:24.47]Is there any sounds?
[07:27.15]Everyone doesn't know that Nitrome's co-developing a Shovel Knight game.
[07:36.46]That's pretty awesome.
[07:41.82]What is this stupid shit?

[08:45.61]It's working for me.
[08:46.71]Well, what's going on with me?
[08:47.75]Wait, what does it say?
[08:52.01]Flash was blocked on this page.

[09:40.15]Okay.
[09:42.59]Does this one work?
[09:44.33]Plug-in blocked.
[09:45.29]I have it set to allow.
[09:47.15]Why?
[09:47.51]Do you know how long it's going to take for this Flash shit?
[09:56.18]This is like a hundred years of Flash.
[10:01.68]It's going to take... We're going to have to get extinct by the time this is ready to... Okay, here we go.
[10:07.03]Humans are going to get extinct.
[10:09.01]And then Flash will be finally weeded out.
[10:12.25]Alright.
[10:13.07]Trick shot two.
[10:14.05]Good versus evil.

[11:11.28]What should I be?
[11:11.82]Good or evil?
[11:14.18]There's a screamer in this.
[11:15.28]Well, whatever.
[11:15.80]I'm going to get scared.

[18:59.23]Drop this.
[19:00.26]Let's see where we are.
[19:01.06]I don't even know where we are.
[19:02.08]Shovel Knight Dig.
[19:10.22]What's that?
[19:14.39]Okay.

[20:23.51]By a lot.
[20:28.48]Okay, that's it.
[20:30.04]Silly Sausage in Meatland.

[21:01.96]Opera.
[21:04.64]You want me to go get Opera?
[21:06.04]I don't want to use Opera.
[21:09.57]Give me another one.
[21:19.61]I don't think Opera is even installed on like two or three thousand computers.
[21:24.57]Scroll down.
[21:25.11]Alright, well, what the fuck?
[21:25.99]Can I even play games on here?
[21:29.89]Well, I guess we'll go here.

[23:52.93]Didn't they make a Mickey Mouse game about this?

[23:59.15]Left, right, and jump.
[24:00.79]Okay.

[24:33.62]Good.
[24:33.84]Good to know.
[24:34.48]I was like just so angry for no reason.
[24:41.33]I have red paint.
[24:42.13]Okay.
[24:44.52]So when I have red eye, I can walk on red material.

[26:19.94]Unrealistic.
[26:20.56]Oh, yeah.

[34:15.32]I don't think that was loud for you, but whatever.
[34:17.40]Okay.
[34:18.20]Instructions.
[34:20.56]Goal of the game is to survive and destroy the enemy base.
[34:23.66]The game is divided in five ages.
[34:25.88]With the next age, you need XP points.
[34:28.60]To gain these points, you have to kill enemy units.
[34:30.41]Okay?
[34:31.99]You can also gain XP points when one of your units is killed.
[34:34.93]You can also build defenses.
[34:38.01]Finding the balance between defense and offense is the key.
[34:43.41]Wait, is it intentional?
[34:44.51]What?
[34:47.59]What did I do?
[34:50.39]You'll also be able to use a special attack.
[34:53.72]This attack will... What did I do?
[34:55.08]This attack will need time to be available again after you use it.
[35:01.48]Each age has its own special attack.
[35:04.54]Sure.
[35:05.26]You cannot repair your base, but it will gain health points every time you evolve to the next age.
[35:08.38]Protect your base at all costs.
[35:13.90]Okay.
[35:16.24]Like, 1998 flash games are the same thing as 1998 video games.
[35:21.45]They're insanely hard.
[35:23.05]And if I do impossible, it's actually impossible and you can't win.
[35:27.71]Your volume is down?
[35:29.21]No, it's not.
[35:32.61]It's not.

[60:29.61]You need a shit ton of fodder.
[60:33.89]Alright, hold on.
[60:41.40]I feel like I'm playing a game of StarCraft.
[60:44.85]We both- It's 1v1 and we both own 50% of the entire fucking map each.
[60:51.15]We have thousands of units.
[60:52.99]At some point- Do you just call a truce?
[61:02.29]Like, after like four or five hours when it's like the game balance makes it impossible for anyone to win.
[61:07.59]The only way you win in a game like that in StarCraft or WarCraft is if somebody's parents call them.
[61:14.42]Because they're, like, concerned because it's been, like, four hours.
[61:16.30]You know what I mean?
[61:17.34]Like, Dave?
[61:19.18]David?
[61:20.32]Mom?
[61:21.14]What are you?
[61:21.48]That's all it takes.
[61:22.32]That time.
[61:22.98]That's the amount of time.
[61:23.58]That's it.
[61:23.80]It's over.
[61:24.26]You lost.
[61:25.81]When that happens, that's how you decide.
[61:34.23]So, I'm just going to spam God's Blades then.
[61:37.55]Just make a million basic units.
[61:39.72]Whatever.
[61:40.06]I'll try it.
[61:51.34]This is feeding.
[62:00.90]Feeding.
[62:07.00]It's not a good plan.
[62:14.25]This is just what it feels like to be lane minions.
[62:19.31]There's two giant fucking structures, two huge mo- Wait, why are they damaged?
[62:27.06]How did I do that damage?
[62:29.08]Alright, I'm going in with super soldiers only.
[62:35.42]Your towers are killing him.
[62:36.96]How?
[62:39.44]How the fuck is that happening?
[62:52.05]It's overshooting people sometimes.
[63:00.68]Tanks.
[63:01.28]Only tanks.
[63:13.12]I must sell the ions and use the cash for soldiers.
[63:15.80]No, that's the only thing keeping me alive.
[63:17.16]We're just waiting.
[63:21.07]Just waiting to kill each other.
[63:32.02]Sell, replace them.
[63:33.98]No, I can't.
[63:39.58]What the fuck?
[63:42.78]Just let him die.
[63:43.54]I'm just going to farm to like 5 million gold.
[63:49.31]Now buy the super soldier.

[76:29.59]And you timed it.
[76:32.57]You know, it was about four or five minutes from when they were in the corner of the room.
[76:36.62]They went and checked on every single person.
[76:38.52]You timed it a few times.
[76:39.80]It was about four and a half minutes.
[76:43.62]Right there.

[106:08.73]I should have won that last one, but it was just, there's too far.
[106:13.94]I gotta kill the guy up top first.
[106:15.12]He's the biggest pain in the ass.
[106:17.68]Okay.
[106:18.64]We're talking about, like, the tree's butt.
[106:21.98]Right where, like, the tree is bending over.
[106:24.51]Like, this is the tree's, like, butt.
[106:27.33]Tree's butt with this much power.

[106:46.98]From the tree's butt, we gotta go down to the tree's, you know, down to the tree's like thigh.
[106:50.56]Right here.

[107:13.15]Right there on the jet ski.
[107:13.99]Yes, yes, yes.
[107:14.67]Knock him off.
[107:15.05]Knock that motherfucker off the tree.

[108:21.86]No, don't.
[108:23.84]Oh, my God.
[108:24.49]That was a little bit.
[108:51.19]Hold R to restart.
[108:52.51]Does that work?
[108:58.67]It's 100 damage if you get hit by that directly.
[109:01.57]What the fuck?
[109:04.83]I just hit R and it didn't do anything.
[109:05.94]You lied.
[109:06.34]Oh my god.
[109:10.74]This whole game has been easy until the final level.
[109:14.92]I just ran out of missiles.
[109:17.66]I'm not even paying attention anymore.
[109:19.94]I have to just restart.
[109:20.74]Do it again.
[109:26.17]It's control W. No, I don't want to... No, don't do that.
[109:28.33]Alright, I'm... I didn't... I didn't think I was going to be here for this long.
[109:44.72]I didn't think I was going to do this for this long.
[109:46.46]Guy in the jet ski.
[109:47.60]Restart.
[109:47.88]Just...
[109:57.81]I don't even care.
[110:24.62]He's losing hair.
[110:25.56]It's so stupid.
[110:28.84]Why?
[110:35.42]Why?
[110:44.85]All of a sudden, they're just bad at the game now.
[110:47.27]Eek, a shark.
[110:48.23]It's going to hit the guy in the tree and it's going to knock him down.
[110:51.23]I'm just...
[110:53.13]How can I be fucking this, like, malding at a 2000, like, 2 flash game?
[111:00.38]I'm just like, I'm tilted.
[111:09.38]What the fuck did that even hit, man?
[111:11.18]What did that even hit?
[111:12.22]Turn the face cam on?
[111:14.04]No, I'm done with clothes on.

[111:20.42]I don't, I can't do that.
[111:31.21]No, fuck that.

[111:45.58]There it is.
[111:45.88]Knock him in.
[111:46.24]Knock him in.
[111:56.94]That couldn't have been a worse outcome.
[112:05.39]God, I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[112:10.61]You're gonna put clothes on, you're a grown man.
[112:12.33]What, a grown man can't sit in his own house with no clothes on?
[112:14.86]How'd they both die?
[112:17.84]I didn't even look.
[112:22.64]So a grown man in his own home cannot wear, I have to wear a t-shirt and like pants in my house?
[112:30.21]no I could literally run from back and forth from like bedroom to office bedroom to office naked just balls hanging it doesn't matter this is my own place I can do whatever I want I could just sprint back and forth and like break dance in the it doesn't matter that's political
[112:59.83]oh and that's how you start the big one I can literally just go down and I could just go to my fridge open it up and open up a fresh almond milk nude just naked and just chug the thing oh no I can chuck almond milk down in my kitchen I can just chug it naked would you what are you what are you gonna stop me
[113:40.72]Stop talking about this.

[113:45.34]Alright, this guy is a little bit up.
[113:47.48]That should be it.
[113:48.70]Ladies and gentlemen.
[113:50.08]Everybody relax.
[113:51.44]We have just killed this dickhead in the tree.
[113:54.35]This last guy in the tree is the only guy we have to kill.
[113:57.17]Just do not kill us both in one shot.
[113:59.77]We didn't.
[114:00.47]This is my opportunity.
[114:01.33]I have to hit this.
[114:02.03]I have to hit this guy right now.
[114:05.07]I have to hit him.
[114:07.85]I think it's right here.
[114:09.55]Right there.
[114:12.06]This is it.
[114:12.84]Yeah, I have to hit him hard in the head.
[114:16.16]I think that's it.
[114:17.59]Maybe a little bit lower.
[114:20.71]I think that's it.
[114:21.65]I think it's like right here.
[114:24.45]Right there.
[114:24.85]Oh, power.
[114:26.87]Higher?
[114:27.19]Is that too high?
[114:28.83]I feel like that's too high.

[116:16.67]I just want to make sure I can tell you.
[116:18.51]You gotta be aware of this.
[116:19.99]I can't hear you.
[116:28.47]That's it.
[116:29.07]I won.
[116:34.90]Well done.

[116:45.88]What's next?
[116:50.08]Why do you keep... Hold on.
[116:51.48]Why do you keep ignoring Icebreaker and Learn to Fly?
[116:54.80]Those are the only games I want to see you play.

[140:37.56]They put you in.
[140:38.48]What do you mean they put me in?
[140:51.44]Wait a second.
[140:54.02]We can't watch this.
[140:55.73]We can't watch this.
[140:57.71]I'm gonna get in trouble if we watch this.
[141:00.07]I'll show a tiny bit.
[141:02.15]I'm gonna get in trouble.
[141:13.63]What does it say?
[141:14.13]VPN saves the day again!
[141:32.88]VPN saves the day again!
[141:40.85]OH!
[141:41.99]OH MY GOD, IT HAPPENED TWICE!
[141:43.77]OH, IT'S WONDERFUL!
[141:50.56]YES!
[141:53.73]Wait, it- YES!
[142:12.59]Thank God for the VPN.
[142:17.23]Yes!
[142:18.79]We're good.
[142:25.73]But anyways, what is this telling me?
[142:34.10]Saves the day again, it does.
[142:47.33]It's showing why I got it in the first place.
[142:55.58]Why the fuck?
[142:56.54]I can't even... Alright, whatever.
[142:58.76]Don't call him dumb.
[143:00.85]Holy shit, dude.
[143:01.39]I just signed into his computer.
[143:04.65]I'm on his computer right now.
[143:17.61]Okay, so let's just let's go ahead and put this on.
[143:21.03]I can't show this.
[143:22.35]I can't show this.
[143:45.07]Oh, thank God for the fucking VPN, man.
[143:47.38]I was... I'm so happy.
[143:50.22]Why is it doing this?
[144:02.22]Okay, let's keep going.
[144:07.48]You never said what VPN you use?
[144:10.50]Um, no.
[144:11.24]Because, I don't know.
[144:12.72]I've got to make sure it works.
[144:17.11]No, computer.
[144:17.85]Don't tell me, don't tell me, what?
[144:19.47]Uh-oh.
[144:34.72]Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.
[144:35.78]I have the wrong booster on.
[144:40.16]Wait, what?
[144:41.30]Oh.
[144:43.80]Oh, shit, it is worse.
[144:46.80]Oops.
[144:47.50]Alright, I have to break this.
[145:05.01]There it is.
[145:05.39]Alright, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[145:08.89]Destroy it.
[145:13.81]By the spring?
[145:14.53]Will that help?
[145:20.81]There's literally nothing but thick pics of Gerbo on his computer.
[145:27.67]Why would I have my own images of me?
[145:29.86]Like, that's weird.
[145:35.26]Go to the next page?
[145:37.68]Um... How do I get on the... Is there a next page here?
[145:40.46]Okay, I need to destroy the wall.
[145:59.04]Alright, we're gonna glide for a little bit.
[146:06.33]I want distance.
[146:06.89]Alright, we're gonna go over that.
[146:07.67]Alright, cleared that.
[146:11.11]Out of fuel, but it's okay.
[146:18.70]What's in front?
[146:19.22]The wall?
[146:27.33]Stop stalling.
[146:28.27]What?
[146:29.33]I'm trying to stay in the... I'm trying to get the distance award.
[146:31.31]Yeah, look, the distance duration three.
[146:45.10]How much have we lost?
[146:46.02]Alright, we needed a plank.
[146:49.11]How about good old sled?
[146:53.39]Or how about, wait, L bouncy?
[146:57.08]This is fast.
[146:59.68]Takeoff.
[147:02.02]Hell bouncy?
[147:06.26]Another glider.
[147:06.92]Okay.
[147:09.44]Hang glider.
[147:11.98]Ultralight trike.
[147:14.62]Pop speed in flight.
[147:16.98]Umbrella.
[147:19.40]Are they tricycle?
[147:23.96]Tricycle.
[147:28.52]Alright, let's go.
[147:32.91]This is huge.
[147:37.21]Oh my god.
[147:38.09]Okay, well, I mean, I burnt all the fuel.
[147:44.47]That is so scary.
[147:50.27]I don't know why.
[147:52.49]Like, the music changed.
[148:14.30]Whoa.
[148:18.65]Whoa.
[148:24.71]Whoa.
[148:33.15]Whoa.
[148:34.49]Whoa.
[148:35.29]Oh, that's the wall.
[148:40.71]Don't slow down.
[148:41.54]I'm trying to stay in the air.
[148:46.26]Wait, what about bonus shop?
[148:47.10]Let me see.
[148:51.82]10% reduction of the drag effect with red zones.
[148:54.10]Yeah.
[148:58.40]Less gravity.
[149:00.27]Fuel capacity.
[149:04.29]See how far you've traveled.
[149:05.51]Oh, it's a little, uh, uh, ommeter.
[149:41.17]Stop going up?
[149:49.84]Oh, my God.
[149:50.42]Did you hear that noise?
[149:51.24]Oh, air balloon.
[149:51.78]Rocket firework.
[149:57.00]Yes.
[149:57.40]Try it.
[150:17.64]Rocket.
[150:20.28]Holy shit.
[150:22.79]Oh boy.
[150:31.03]Too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast.
[150:34.40]I need more damage.
[150:39.58]Need damage.
[150:48.42]There we go.
[150:48.80]Cast iron.
[150:49.32]Let's go.
[150:49.92]And fire.
[150:52.09]Speed.
[151:13.62]Right into the wall.
[151:14.24]This should break it.
[151:14.78]This is gonna break it.
[151:16.28]It's gonna break it.
[151:18.72]150 miles per hour.
[151:19.60]We're getting close to... What happened?
[151:23.48]Where am I?
[151:24.74]Did I go through it?
[151:26.78]I guess I went through it.
[151:27.48]I beat the mountain.
[151:38.51]Oh, nice.
[151:43.12]I got tons of extra gold.
[151:45.00]Try to go higher.
[151:47.83]Alright, hold on.
[151:48.63]Wait.
[151:51.25]Where should I put this into?
[151:54.87]Ooh.
[151:54.95]Ooh.
[152:01.83]I want that one.
[152:02.37]I need to destroy the iceberg and the wall.
[152:14.89]Is that how many times I try to go higher?
[152:16.33]I blew it.
[152:20.37]Oh.
[152:22.47]Okay.
[152:22.99]I guess I've got... Honey, speed four.
[152:27.83]Okay.
[152:39.20]Watch this shit.
[152:45.47]Alright, even it out.
[152:53.19]I'm still really high in the air.
[152:55.09]There's the mountain.
[153:01.16]What did I do?
[153:01.78]I didn't break the mountain yet.
[153:05.46]Did I?
[153:10.76]Did I break the mountain already?
[153:13.80]Oh, I did.
[153:14.20]Okay, never mind.
[153:27.69]Yes.
[153:28.81]Okay, I'm at 200 feet.
[153:29.37]150.
[153:29.39]Speed.
[153:29.59]Very fast.
[153:33.44]Getting close to the ground though.
[153:38.34]There's the iceberg.
[153:56.29]How high are you?
[153:57.14]The children's game is perplexing.
[153:59.00]I'm doing just fine.
[153:59.72]I think I need to do this.
[154:09.20]Yeah.
[154:09.46]Let's go.
[154:10.91]Again.
[154:11.41]Get a new thruster.
[154:26.19]Get rid of the rocket?
[154:27.01]Re!
[154:43.49]I like this pace.
[154:44.41]This is a good pace.
[154:49.00]This is very fast.
[154:50.40]Oh my god.
[154:51.02]I'm breaking the barrier here.
[154:52.76]Come on.
[154:53.28]Where is it?
[154:53.76]It's right there.
[154:57.52]Oh, what?
[154:58.04]Alright.
[155:06.12]Get rid of the firework.
[155:08.48]This is a four shot.
[155:12.39]I'll try this.
[155:36.26]Wasted.
[155:39.00]Kind of.
[155:40.10]I'm pretty high.
[155:40.62]I'm high on the other.
[155:41.16]I'm okay.
[155:44.89]Is it worse?
[155:45.77]That's alright.
[155:46.33]No, I'm good.
[155:46.67]I'm good.
[155:48.19]Look at the speed.
[155:48.79]Are you kidding me?
[155:53.82]Getting close to the ground.
[155:54.84]There it is.
[155:55.14]Destroyed it.
[155:58.02]What's next?
[155:58.68]The wall, right?
[156:05.20]Okay, I need, uh, what do I need?
[156:14.35]1,500.
[156:14.37]That's good.
[156:16.61]What do we got?
[156:17.27]Ooh.
[156:19.94]High tech.
[156:22.32]Ultralight aircraft.
[156:26.70]Propeller.
[156:29.16]Whirlybird 512.
[156:34.97]Trying this one.
[156:36.31]Let's give it a try.
[156:39.20]Uploading ads.
[156:42.58]What the fuck?
[156:44.24]Uh... Um...
[157:09.99]Sending supplies.
[157:11.99]What just happened?
[157:13.93]I don't even know where I'm going.
[157:19.40]I'm 700 feet in the air.
[157:28.22]I can't.
[157:29.24]How do I fly?
[157:30.00]I'm going into space.
[157:33.02]Okay.
[157:35.91]What happens when I run out of propeller fuel?
[157:37.41]I just fall?
[157:39.89]Oh my goodness.
[157:40.69]Okay.
[157:53.64]Where's the eject button?
[158:00.06]I actually hit it.
[158:10.46]Alright, I want to get a different booster.
[158:14.16]A liftoff.
[158:15.14]Yep.
[158:17.38]Okay, let me go back to the bonus shop.
[158:21.68]And I want to do... Adjust the angle of the ramp.
[158:27.63]That sounds kind of ridiculous.
[158:29.13]I'll try it.
[158:42.45]Alright, we're doing a mega ramp.
[158:49.89]Increasing power.
[158:50.69]And... And, I don't know.
[159:28.78]There's the iceberg.
[159:34.91]More of an angle?
[159:35.73]Oh, Jesus.
[159:49.48]There's the wall.
[159:51.94]Distance 5.
[159:55.62]I might hit it.
[159:56.34]Come on.
[159:57.76]It's going to be close.
[160:00.18]I hit it.
[160:00.50]Okay, let's do... No, no damage.
[160:12.27]Should I do... Let's just Mac this out.
[160:19.81]I'm not going to waste all my shit.
[160:25.56]And he won't draft a bat.
[160:26.72]And then let's go.
[160:30.64]The propeller's always going to be doing this, so you know what to do.
[160:32.52]Again, again.
[160:32.86]More, more, more, more.
[160:33.44]Speed, speed, speed, speed, speed.
[160:36.74]Sorry.
[160:37.54]Fucking demon took over for me.
[160:38.64]The goblin took over.
[160:41.88]More speed.
[160:42.58]More.
[160:50.93]More.
[160:58.72]Where's that wall?
[161:03.54]Here it comes.
[161:04.48]Right there.
[161:05.58]I'm not gonna hit it.
[161:06.96]I might.
[161:07.26]Actually, no.
[161:07.82]I think I might.
[161:08.22]200.
[161:08.24]200 feet.
[161:09.36]150.
[161:09.38]100.
[161:09.40]200.
[161:09.42]You are boosting down.
[161:09.90]Shit.
[161:10.02]It's okay.
[161:11.13]I got some money.
[161:29.42]Umbrella.
[161:31.16]Color.
[161:33.30]Zeppelin.
[161:35.88]Ultralight aircraft.
[161:39.71]Alright, I'll get ultralight aircraft.
[161:43.25]Save the money.
[161:58.51]Let's go.
[161:59.44]700 feet in the air.
[162:00.70]Fast as fuck.
[162:14.92]I'm crashing into that wall right now.
[162:25.43]200 miles per hour.
[162:26.29]It's going to break.
[162:28.23]Am I angling down?
[162:29.11]I don't know.
[162:31.13]It'll be easier to smash into stuff.
[162:36.37]600.
[162:36.41]Come on!
[162:36.93]Go, go, go, go, go!
[162:41.37]No!
[162:45.21]Lift!
[162:47.21]I can't lift.
[162:47.75]It's alright.
[162:48.67]I'm getting a new thing anyways.
[162:49.72]Fuck.
[162:52.20]Just do a front flip.
[162:56.42]I just wanted money to get the other thing anyways.
[162:58.97]Okay, let's get it.
[163:01.25]Ultralight aircraft.
[163:06.78]And... This is the best thing I can get, right?
[163:10.58]I guess I could do, like, boom, box.
[163:15.11]What about thrusters?
[163:16.31]Is this the best thing I can get?
[163:17.17]I don't know.
[163:19.57]Alright, let's give it a try.
[163:32.32]Dude, this thing's going over 300 miles per hour.
[163:34.36]Holy shit.
[163:42.00]Oh, my God.
[163:42.97]This is going so... I missed the iceberg.
[163:46.03]What happened?
[163:46.37]Did I skim off the ground?
[163:47.31]I'm not trying to hit the iceberg.
[164:08.23]He just bounced again.
[164:13.45]What is going on here?
[164:14.45]Change the ramp?
[164:24.81]Oh, that's a good idea.
[164:28.45]Like that, right?
[164:33.29]Like this?
[164:33.67]Somewhere in the middle?
[164:45.47]Omega.
[164:47.77]Omega.
[165:00.74]Alright, we're going to just skim for a little bit.
[165:11.11]There we go.
[165:11.57]Look at that.
[165:17.88]And look at that.
[165:18.48]Okay.
[165:28.39]Couple more times.
[165:30.31]Need fuel.
[165:54.07]I'm testing a theory out here.
[166:01.01]Theory busted.
[166:03.01]Theory busted.
[166:03.83]Theory busted.
[166:04.61]Theory busted.
[166:05.53]Theory busted.
[166:20.69]Get the Omega.
[166:22.51]The Omega catalog.
[166:25.72]One extra upgrade in every possible aspect.
[166:28.06]I need a thousand points.
[166:41.45]Alright, let's stay at around like 250, 300.
[166:42.89]This looks good to me.
[166:56.27]Okay, looking good.
[167:07.64]Oh shit, 370.
[167:08.76]Okay, crashed right into it going so fast.
[167:11.90]Alright.
[167:12.20]Okay, what do I need?
[167:20.58]I got 10,000.
[167:20.82]Okay, I need a little more.
[167:27.69]A little more.
[167:28.07]I need some more fuel.
[167:29.15]Alright, save it.
[167:40.15]Halo Jerma.
[167:40.79]I will, I will, I will.
[167:48.51]I'm going to save two rockets.
[167:55.64]There's one.
[167:58.38]I'm gonna do it right before we crash.
[168:02.34]Oh boy.
[168:03.58]Okay, pull up.
[168:05.18]Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up right now.
[168:14.71]Okay, payload.
[168:18.15]What are we talking about?
[168:25.59]Just get the payload.
[168:30.23]Power power power power power.
[168:32.27]Why'd I do that?
[168:35.37]What do you mean?
[169:00.40]Okay, I'm going to get some speed and I'm going to pull up.
[169:05.56]What did I destroy?
[169:06.24]Something?
[169:07.26]What did I destroy?
[169:08.24]Iceberg?
[169:11.64]Got all my rockets.
[169:15.37]Go through all.
[169:19.09]Wait, what just happened?
[169:20.53]I skipped off the ground.
[169:24.09]It's a break.
[169:24.67]This is going to break.
[169:27.95]Three, two, one.
[169:29.03]There it goes.
[169:30.73]Did I win?
[169:42.69]Nice.
[169:42.99]A penguin.
[169:48.48]Get revenge on those pesky icebergs.
[169:52.30]Mission accomplished.
[169:58.26]Penguins stink.
[169:59.10]What kind of stupid non-flying animal calls itself a bird?
[170:01.52]Give up and die.
[170:13.00]What is this?
[170:24.59]Congratulations.
[170:25.59]Haha, not bad.
[170:26.47]It's alright.
[170:28.95]Cool.
[170:32.87]Classic mode has been unlocked.
[170:41.10]So what does that do?
[170:41.66]Go play Learn to Fly 3.
[170:46.92]No, I... Let's hold on to that one.
[170:49.98]I'll do that one another time.
[170:53.22]Where else are we going to go?
[170:54.24]Skywire.
[170:54.98]Yeah, I promised I was going to play Skywire.
[170:57.51]Let's do Skywire.
[171:11.02]Here it comes.
[171:17.75]What other time?
[171:18.51]Flash is going to end.
[171:19.91]We'll do this again soon.
[171:20.71]I love Flash game nights.
[171:34.14]They're a lot of fun.
[171:47.86]You guys have really good recommendations.
[171:51.96]Okay, that looks good.
[172:00.20]Okay, this is Skywire.
[172:04.90]Play.
[172:06.56]Turn it down a little.
[172:07.86]Okay, how do you play?

[192:44.69]Break it.
[192:45.03]Okay, who's next?
[192:53.50]There's a rope here.
[192:56.23]So I'm gonna assume we gotta cut this, and it's gonna swing.

[194:53.10]He might go off of it.
[194:54.07]Like a ramp.
[194:54.45]Like a jump.
[194:55.95]Keep going.
[194:56.67]Over that.

[195:35.78]Okay, we're gonna- we have to hit them with the hammer so it goes boink.
[195:41.11]These runes are very powerful and dangerous.
[195:42.89]These creatures are also harmful.
[195:53.50]I don't know why I did that.
[195:54.90]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[195:55.78]Oops.

[203:27.26]Get more fish, friends.
[203:30.22]I need... Where are those rings at?
[203:31.43]There's some over there.
[203:33.99]Hold on.
[203:34.97]Alright.
[203:38.99]I'm going to get this ring.
[203:39.69]Ready?
[203:42.52]Shit, I missed it.
[203:44.69]There it is.
[203:45.47]No, it moved.
[203:46.07]Fuck.
[203:59.64]I got too concerned.
[204:00.56]And there's the flip!
[204:04.80]I have to get to space.
[204:05.72]I need to do a hyper-advanced technique.

[204:22.87]Ow, my chest.
[204:23.95]That hurt.
[204:24.87]That actually really hurt.
[204:25.74]I don't know why I thought that was that funny.
[204:27.46]Alright, one more try.
[204:31.66]Last try.
[204:47.34]Ooh, that was good!
[204:55.61]Stop doing the tail slide!
[205:22.67]I'm just bad at- I can't do this shit.
[205:24.89]I don't like using the keyboard.
[205:25.84]Give me a controller.
[205:27.64]Finish it!
[205:56.55]Oh, finish it.
[206:06.06]Oh, fuck.
[206:06.66]That hurt.
[206:07.32]God damn it.
[206:12.28]I messed it up.
[206:13.16]Oh well.
[206:26.74]One more time.
[206:27.10]I want to do it one more time.
[206:27.84]Alright, one more time.
[206:36.23]That's it.
[206:36.51]Last one.
[206:49.50]Fish.
[206:49.94]Good.
[206:50.20]Got some fish friends.

[207:18.02]What?
[207:23.70]Where are the firearms games?
[207:26.74]Stop it.
[207:33.08]I'm playing dolphin diving.
[207:40.32]You can do with some, no, less violence today, okay?
[207:47.89]I know, I gotta keep combos going to get out of the water faster.
[208:01.73]Fuck you game, fuck you!
[208:03.51]Alright, what's the next one?
[208:21.29]What's the next one?
[208:23.19]This game's so fun, but I can't do it.
[208:24.77]I don't like the keyboard.
[208:26.01]I hate using the keyboard for everything.
[208:36.54]He's dead.
[208:40.10]He didn't even make it to space.
[208:41.12]I can't.
[208:41.58]I can't do it.
[208:52.09]What's a good quick one?
[208:53.25]I only got like 30 minutes before I gotta go.
[208:57.99]Rubble Trouble.
[208:58.65]Alright, yeah.
[208:59.04]That's the one we were gonna do.
[208:59.96]We're gonna do Rubble Trouble.
[209:15.28]murloc RPG hold on to some of these I love this I love streaming
[209:38.31]I'm acting like I just started.
[209:39.90]I love streaming.
[209:40.88]Hold on to somebody's new games, guys.
[209:42.06]Maybe I'll come back in a couple months.
[209:43.22]I kind of like it.
[209:44.44]Alright, this is Rubble Trouble New York.
[209:48.40]What are you doing?
[209:50.72]Alright, lads, we've got to make $1,100 to complete the job.
[209:59.99]Okay, boss, we'll trigger the explosives with sticks of nitroglycerin.
[210:05.24]Just remember, we get money for every bit that crumbles to dust, so destroy it all.
[210:08.72]Press the tool button at the bottom to use the nitro.
[210:11.54]Okay.
[210:15.96]Oh, uh... Hold on.
[210:18.59]I have less of the game.
[210:20.69]Okay.
[210:36.89]Now click this button to select your tool.
[210:38.58]Click anywhere to create an explosion.
[210:39.88]Alright, right here.
[210:41.56]Right on the edge.
[210:42.96]Click anywhere to create an explosion.
[210:46.56]Right here on the edge.
[210:47.16]Alright, that was easy.
[210:50.83]You just cropped it.
[211:06.32]Drill time.
[211:07.40]Serious damage coming up, boss.
[211:10.56]Barry, the drill is too expensive.
[211:12.48]Don't waste it.
[211:13.22]The drill can be used from above as well.
[211:15.64]Neat, huh?
[211:16.16]The drill will target the nearest block that is to the side or below the mouse pointer.
[211:24.54]It explodes when it can't drill.
[211:25.78]Okay.
[211:27.62]Cool.
[211:28.08]Cool.
[211:39.67]Very cool.
[211:41.27]Cool.
[211:41.57]Cool.
[211:41.97]Try again.
[211:44.75]Cool.
[212:12.50]Try again.
[212:13.44]Cool!
[212:36.96]He doesn't know this is a video game.
[212:39.24]Boss, I've done a modification to the cement mixer.
[212:42.10]Gary, what have you made this time?
[212:44.06]A cannon.
[212:44.68]A cement mixer that fires cannonballs.
[212:46.44]It's easy to use.
[212:47.04]Just push the cannon, find a good angle, and hold down the mouse button until you have enough power.
[212:52.67]Oh, dear.
[212:54.05]Try to destroy just the building this time and keep away from my van.
[212:57.09]Okay, cannonball.
[213:03.84]Okay, so just destroy just the building.
[213:05.84]Don't touch my van.
[213:07.16]I did something wrong.
[213:11.57]What?
[213:11.83]Where'd it go?
[213:31.97]Oh shit, did I do it?
[213:33.85]Hey, hey, I'm doing it!
[213:34.77]I did it!
[213:35.27]Get the fuck in there.
[213:36.45]Okay.
[213:36.73]Just give me a break.
[214:04.66]More!
[214:06.22]Whoops.
[214:10.08]Omega Lul, Raft Wars 2.
[214:12.58]Barry, use the heli- Wait, what?
[214:15.60]Cool, thanks boss.
[214:16.27]Remember, it runs out of fuel quickly.
[214:17.67]Barry, because it's heavy, it'll smash through every glass everywhere.
[214:22.99]Position the wrecking ball with the mouse pointer.
[214:24.41]Click to begin.
[214:25.11]You have a limited amount of time to use the wrecking ball, so get swinging.
[214:37.69]Get in there.
[214:41.08]Whatever.
[214:41.82]Get in there.
[214:42.54]You're killing me.
[215:01.19]It moves around way too fast.
[215:02.51]I got it all, right?
[215:17.06]I got it?
[215:17.42]Alright, next level.
[215:21.52]What?
[215:21.76]Barry, look.
[215:22.74]What is it, boss?
[215:24.34]Oh, ah.
[215:25.34]Sorry, guys.
[215:25.80]I can't get down.
[215:27.16]We have no time for this.
[215:28.06]Get your silly brother to the floor without injuring him.
[216:08.92]Alright, so hold on.
[216:20.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:22.71]Oh, wait, wait.
[216:23.19]He's okay.
[216:32.01]He's almost on the floor.
[216:32.69]Hold on.
[216:48.49]I don't even... I don't like these kind of games.
[217:20.11]Because I've found a missile launcher.
[217:21.53]Evan finds a lot of things.
[217:24.05]Yeah, I don't want to lose my brain.
[217:25.27]I just want to sprint as fast as I can into a wall and smash my head into it.
[217:29.37]I mean, I... Do puzzles and, like, figure out what to, like, what, like, pillar to... No, no, no, no.
[217:33.61]Put your head down.
[217:34.80]Run as fast as I can and head into a wall.
[217:36.42]Break through the wall.
[217:42.12]Okay, position the launcher with the mouse pointer.
[217:43.94]Click to place the vehicle.
[217:45.84]Then click again to launch missile.
[217:47.70]Steer the missile with the mouse.
[217:51.05]Okay.
[217:51.29]That's fun.
[217:51.85]I like that part.
[217:53.15]What?
[217:53.37]Oh shit, it already went.
[217:54.76]It's like Metal Gear Solid.
[218:17.68]I like that one.
[218:18.20]That was fun because I was just putting my head down and running into a wall as far as I can and exploding it.
[218:21.58]Turn the shitty music off.
[218:25.30]It's not that.
[218:25.74]What?
[218:27.84]Don't let any debris hit the... That's what they meant.
[218:38.59]Okay.
[218:41.17]You guys don't like that?
[218:42.03]You don't?
[218:57.54]Don't!
[218:57.96]Okay, we're good.
[219:05.25]It's complete, right?
[219:05.85]Yeah, okay.
[219:09.65]Cousin, I haven't found a plane.
[219:10.99]It can destroy a lot of stuff quickly.
[219:13.41]Don't blow me up, bruv.
[219:15.05]Hmm, I'll help push stuff around with the helicopter.
[219:18.17]Okay, but Gary, you can only bomb stuff in the yellow barriers.
[219:23.20]I guess you should get Gary down from there.
[219:38.63]he's british alright watch out watch out watch out watch out Larry Larry Larry Larry you're fine
[220:08.53]Alright, he's going to come down nice and softly.
[220:10.63]Okay, now I just need to wrecking ball.
[220:19.21]Holy fuck, I just squished him.
[220:23.10]Damn it!
[220:23.76]I knew I was going to do that.
[220:25.16]Damn it!
[220:26.24]I don't like this.
[220:27.82]Give me another one.
[220:29.80]Give me another one.
[220:30.36]Give me another one.
[220:38.30]Save him!
[220:38.86]I thought he was gonna be safe.
[220:40.74]Fuck.
[220:40.96]Bad Ice Cream 3.
[220:42.00]I tried to play that earlier.
[220:43.56]I couldn't get it to work.
[221:09.93]Just trying to kill him one more time.
[221:10.87]Yeah, I'm done with this one.
[221:13.89]I usually don't like to play these kinds of games.
[221:15.31]They're cute and they're fun, but no, not for me.
[221:17.75]What's next?
[221:18.99]Motherload?
[221:19.71]Okay, Motherload.
[221:27.73]Motherload Flash game.
[221:31.81]Is it also on Nitro?
[221:32.47]Okay.
[221:37.17]Okay.
[221:39.42]Enable flash.
[221:42.92]Alright, this is a tiny fucking window.
[221:44.86]Can I like full screen this?
[221:51.42]This is so small.
[221:56.40]Mother load.
[221:59.53]Mother load gold edition?
[222:07.20]Back when monitors had 640x480 resolution.
[222:21.10]Okay.
[222:22.10]Need to move this.
[222:23.04]That looks good.
[222:24.86]Alright, what is this game?
[222:26.92]The full screen button?
[222:28.46]Um... MiniClip says, switch to focus mode to concentrate.
[222:32.98]This will restart your game.
[222:35.24]Okay.
[222:35.96]Full screen mode.
[222:39.14]Did it work?
[222:39.46]I mean, it sort of worked.
[222:44.96]A little better.
[222:50.63]Kind of exactly the same, though.
[222:58.58]How's this one?
[222:58.94]Is this game good?
[223:07.41]Meat and fuck.
[223:08.41]I'm not gonna play meat and fuck adventure.
[223:12.05]I'm gonna get... I will be removed from this platform.
[223:15.36]I'm not gonna play that.
[223:16.14]Control your pod using the arrow keys.
[223:21.62]Or if it's more comfortable, the WASD, okay?
[223:24.24]Your drill deploys automatically if you move into diggable material.
[223:28.49]You cannot drill straight up.
[223:30.25]You can trade minerals in your storage bay for cold hard cash.
[223:34.21]Ooh!
[223:35.43]I think I'm gonna like this.
[223:36.91]Let's go.
[223:39.80]Loud.
[223:44.14]Transmission.
[223:45.95]Transmission.
[223:47.53]We forgot to refuel you on the way over.
[223:49.63]Drive over to the fuel station and fill her up.
[223:51.65]It's been almost impossible to hire decent miners on Mars since all the strange activities started happening around here.
[223:59.03]That's why we're willing to pay you at a premium for your services.
[224:02.85]I've given you a basic mining machine to get you started with.
[224:05.43]Unfortunately, you'll be on your own from this point onward, as the settlers, who were lucky enough to escape with their lives, have fled to safety.
[224:12.37]However, all the shops here have been computerized, so you'll still be able to sell your minerals, fuel up, upgrade your pod, and buy special items.
[224:22.30]Remember, your job is to collect minerals and bring them back to the surface for processing.
[224:26.85]The deeper you dig, the more valuable in minerals you will encounter.
[224:30.11]Don't forget to refuel.
[224:32.99]Good luck.
[224:34.42]His mission terminated.
[224:37.28]Refuel.
[224:39.30]$20.
[224:39.34]Okay, let's go.
[224:41.58]Alright.
[224:43.04]$5, $4 purchased.
[224:44.84]It's time to dig.
[224:50.14]Alright, what's over there?
[224:50.82]Is that lava or is that minerals?
[224:59.61]Okay, it's minerals.
[225:02.97]Alright, I'm doing alright.
[225:07.44]Ow.
[225:09.50]It's like Dig Dug?
[225:10.28]It's like Dig Dug, but you can sell stuff.
[225:14.34]Ironium.
[225:18.35]Silverium.
[225:20.83]Bronzium.
[225:36.88]Whatever.
[225:37.32]It's okay.
[225:38.82]It's okay.
[225:39.76]It's alright.
[225:40.24]We'll be fine.
[225:43.59]Going down.
[225:44.33]Gold over here.
[225:45.19]Want some money?
[225:46.99]Alright.
[225:47.37]Just be careful.
[226:08.56]Cargo bay full, alright.
[226:10.48]How do I get out of here?
[226:12.48]Oh shit, I can fly.
[226:15.27]Ooh, careful!
[226:18.01]Mineral processing.
[226:18.95]Sell all.
[226:19.19]$620.
[226:19.21]Okay.
[226:19.31]So, how do I upgrade?
[226:42.28]What's over here?
[226:43.74]Junk shop.
[226:44.20]Welcome to the upgrade shop.
[226:45.14]Okay.
[226:47.72]Drill.
[226:49.39]Oh, this is cool.
[226:50.35]Hull.
[226:53.03]17 health.
[226:55.71]30 health.
[227:01.84]Drill.
[227:02.14]750.
[227:02.54]I don't have enough.
[227:03.94]Okay.
[227:04.14]Well, I know this is here.
[227:18.34]Repair?
[227:19.86]Oh, shit.
[227:20.22]I should repair.
[227:20.68]I'll be okay.
[227:22.30]Hold on.
[227:22.56]I'm just gonna get a few more.
[227:23.46]Alright, I'm coming back up.
[227:31.77]I have... How much money?
[227:35.83]Fuel is low.
[227:36.99]Alright, sell all this.
[227:39.99]Refuel.
[227:41.07]Build a tank.
[227:45.01]Uh, what are you... What are you repairing?
[227:49.64]You can save your game.
[227:50.44]Yeah, sure.
[227:55.44]You explode if you run out of fuel.
[227:59.07]Oh, it's right, okay.
[228:01.13]There it is.
[228:01.49]What is this?
[228:03.57]Reserve fuel tank.
[228:04.93]I can't afford any of this.
[228:05.71]Alright, repair.
[228:06.17]I could have just done that.
[228:10.21]Alright, I'm going to buy the other drill.
[228:18.01]This is the Sylvai Drill.
[228:20.85]Nice.
[228:21.69]Nice.
[228:24.75]Alright, let's go.
[228:26.05]It was incredibly inefficient.
[228:52.97]Hey, how much?
[228:53.39]I gotta get out fuel.
[228:55.85]I need more.
[228:56.35]I'll pick a fuel tank.
[229:01.97]Hey!
[229:04.09]Get me out of here!
[229:05.71]What the f... Oh!
[229:12.04]Mineral... No, I want to do the...

[229:34.24]This is expensive shit.
[229:40.95]500.
[229:41.83]Ow.
[229:47.53]Cargo full.
[229:50.49]Back up.
[229:53.27]What's this game called?
[229:53.99]I don't remember.
[229:57.22]I actually have no idea.
[229:59.02]It's like Load Up or something.
[230:07.32]No, don't get the fuel yet.
[230:12.91]600 bucks, that's it?
[230:19.13]I'm always out of fuel every second.
[230:31.27]Okay, dang.
[230:36.26]Need a bigger tank?
[230:37.04]I need money.
[230:38.52]Okay, I gotta be careful with the fuel.
[230:49.34]These three and I'm going back.
[230:50.82]Alright, alright, alright.
[230:53.31]Careful, don't smash your head on the ceiling.
[231:00.40]Alright, process this shit.

[231:44.14]50%, 20% or something.
[231:44.94]I'm just going to dig straight down and I'm going to go straight up.
[232:07.89]Give me this.
[232:09.81]Oh my god, I haven't gone to the bathroom.
[232:12.79]I completely forgot to go to the bathroom.
[232:15.83]Boy, right.
[232:16.43]Whoops.
[232:30.56]I forgot.
[232:31.10]400.
[232:32.31]Alright, let me... I'm gonna pee and then I'm coming back.
