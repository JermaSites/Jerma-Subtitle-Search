[00:05.94]Workout today.
[00:07.66]Working out today.
[00:09.86]How's everybody doing?
[00:12.10]Good afternoon.
[00:14.48]Running around.
[00:16.80]Maybe ran a little too much.
[00:19.27]Up and down the stairs.
[00:24.37]I noticed what time it was.
[00:27.01]Oh my God, I'm pressing buttons.
[00:28.47]I noticed what time it was about maybe six or seven minutes ago and I was kind of not ready.
[00:34.80]So I just had to freak out and I ran around the house.
[00:37.38]I got to get coffee.
[00:38.78]I've got to have something to eat.
[00:40.42]I've got to pee.
[00:41.46]I sometimes got to do the other one.
[00:43.58]Sometimes, not every day, maybe like a few times a week.
[00:46.69]Maybe like once or twice a week.
[00:49.15]Give me some break.
[00:50.03]Give me a slack here.
[00:58.58]He's very, very constipated.
[01:03.68]Karma cares about his life more than he cares about us.
[01:06.55]He hates us.
[01:09.07]He hates us.
[01:12.59]This guy had to go to the bathroom.
[01:13.99]He hates us.
[01:18.61]Once a week exclusivity.
[01:22.15]You know, that's a good point.
[01:23.59]Do you guys have...
[01:27.48]I care.
[01:28.24]I care.
[01:28.76]True.
[01:29.22]He does.
[01:29.90]No, I don't.
[01:30.28]No, no, no, I can't.
[01:33.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:34.22]Like, hold on.
[01:34.96]Wait a second.
[01:37.12]I'm saying he hates this thing.
[01:38.88]I don't.
[01:41.12]I was referring to he hates us.
[01:43.14]No, I don't.
[01:43.96]I read that.
[01:44.56]And then I read the accidental next one, which is he cares.
[01:48.03]And then I said, no, I don't.
[01:49.09]Don't worry.
[01:50.05]Don't worry.
[01:52.59]It was a fucked up slip, whatever they call them.
[01:57.60]No, I don't.
[02:01.72]What does this person say?
[02:02.66]Last time I was this early to a Germa stream, I wasn't under audit for evading federal taxes.

[04:55.27]HTML5 games are now here.
[04:57.29]Oh, that's good.
[04:59.49]Alright, so I don't know anything about this website.

[05:18.71]Okay, Ice Cream apparently is very, very popular.
[05:24.33]Why are these so popular?
[05:26.91]This is the most popular game ever.
[05:28.21]Should I play this one?
[05:28.95]I'm gonna play the original Bee Ice Cream.
[05:34.46]Because this is the top game on the whole website.
[05:39.47]Right?
[05:43.25]I got it.
[05:43.61]This is the worst game.
[05:49.24]How is the worst game the top game?
[06:02.01]Because it is.
[06:03.87]Wait.
[06:05.55]Flash should be on.
[06:06.45]I turned it on before the stream.
[06:09.82]What the fuck?
[06:10.34]What about Bee Ice Cream 2?
[06:11.31]Please wait.
[06:16.25]This takes more than 10 seconds.
[06:17.61]You don't have Flash installed.

[06:57.90]I've got to be careful.
[06:58.60]I don't want to click random shit anymore.
[07:02.95]That's how you get in trouble.
[07:05.81]Okay, this is Bee Ice Cream.
[07:10.35]Can I zoom in?
[07:11.59]Is this good?
[07:17.33]You can give me your credit card info.
[07:22.47]What do I do?
[07:23.51]Is this Bee Ice Cream?
[07:24.47]Is there any sounds?
[07:27.15]Everyone doesn't know that Nitrome's co-developing a Shovel Knight game.
[07:36.46]That's pretty awesome.
[07:41.82]What is this stupid shit?
[07:43.42]It's a, I don't know, it's a screen saver.
[07:44.88]It has to load it.

[08:23.57]Beat Ice Cream 1!
[08:28.76]What's going on here?
[08:29.54]This is why they're killing flash.
[08:36.06]It's your java.
[08:39.38]The Ice Cream 2 waiting room.
[08:45.61]It's working for me.
[08:46.71]Well, what's going on with me?
[08:47.75]Wait, what does it say?
[08:52.01]Flash was blocked on this page.
[08:55.15]Hold on.

[09:21.48]What the fuck?
[09:25.00]How would it be blocked if it's currently showing this?
[09:30.60]He's tech illiterate.
[09:32.86]I'm just on a website, man.
[09:36.41]I can't even play a game.
[09:37.47]All right, I'm going to play.
[09:38.25]I'm going to click on twin shot two.
[09:40.15]Okay.
[09:42.59]Does this one work?
[09:44.33]Plug-in blocked.
[09:45.29]I have it set to allow.
[09:47.15]Why?
[09:47.51]Do you know how long it's going to take for this Flash shit?
[09:56.18]This is like a hundred years of Flash.
[10:01.68]It's going to take... We're going to have to get extinct by the time this is ready to... Okay, here we go.
[10:07.03]Humans are going to get extinct.
[10:09.01]And then Flash will be finally weeded out.
[10:12.25]All right.
[10:13.07]Trick shot two.
[10:14.05]Good versus evil.
[10:17.67]Why does it look so bad?
[10:18.73]Why does it look like this?
[10:23.95]Zoom in.

[10:49.23]Okay, all right.
[10:54.24]I wanna play.
[10:54.86]Well, you can't.
[10:55.50]All right, can I pick my character?
[10:57.64]Okay, how about this one, Garfield?
[11:03.48]All right, it's arrow keys and space.
[11:07.58]Ready.
[11:09.66]Good.
[11:09.98]Or evil.
[11:11.28]What should I be?
[11:11.82]Good or evil?
[11:14.18]There's a screamer in this.
[11:15.28]Well, whatever.
[11:15.80]I'm going to get scared.
[11:18.60]Evil.
[11:18.92]Okay.
[11:21.73]Evil level one.
[11:22.95]This looks... Down below, they plot and plan the next time they will invade us.
[11:27.57]This time, things are going to be different.
[11:29.77]This time, we're going to come in and invade them.

[16:59.43]And we're just kind of driving down like the video game highway.
[17:03.89]I'm just pointing at fast food restaurants that go by.
[17:07.92]Oh, stop at McDonald's.

[18:08.29]You suck.
[18:10.71]Oh, I was just standing- alright, I'm done- I'm done with this one.

[18:15.42]That was cool to go down memory lane for a little bit.
[18:16.98]Alright, we're back on Nitrome.

[18:26.76]I'm trying, I'm trying to do big ice cream again.

[18:37.61]Click maps, click maps.
[18:38.55]Alright, well, wait, wait, wait.

[18:51.62]Where's Icebreaker?
[18:52.92]Icebreaker.
[18:55.77]Alright, let's go back to the main page.
[18:59.23]Drop this.
[19:00.26]Let's see where we are.
[19:01.06]I don't even know where we are.
[19:02.08]Shovel Knight Dig.
[19:10.22]What's that?
[19:14.39]Okay.
[19:15.05]Should I just browse all games and turn on clickmaps?
[19:22.59]Rust Bucket Vault.
[19:26.14]Okay, more games.
[19:29.42]All games, okay.
[19:30.45]All right, let's just start right here.
[19:37.17]Let's get click maps going.
[19:40.40]Let me make sure I have that right, okay.
[19:43.18]Okay.
[19:46.18]You ready?
[19:48.22]Where are we going?
[19:48.90]Where are we going now?
[19:56.89]Okay.
[19:58.54]Stretchy poop.

[20:13.12]Territory war.
[20:13.92]Territory war.
[20:14.68]We're just gonna scroll down.
[20:18.81]Okay, so we have silly sausage and meat land.
[20:20.71]This looks like what everybody wants.
[20:23.51]By a lot.
[20:28.48]Okay, that's it.
[20:30.04]Silly Sausage in Meatland.
[20:31.29]Is this any- is this good?
[20:34.11]How is this one?
[20:40.20]It's very good, okay.
[21:00.20]Opera?
[21:01.96]Opera.
[21:04.64]You want me to go get Opera?
[21:06.04]I don't want to use Opera.
[21:09.57]Give me another one.
[21:19.61]I don't think Opera is even installed on like two or three thousand computers.
[21:24.57]Scroll down.
[21:25.11]Alright, well, what the fuck?
[21:25.99]Can I even play games on here?
[21:29.89]Well, I guess we'll go here.

[23:52.93]Didn't they make a Mickey Mouse game about this?

[23:59.15]Left, right, and jump.
[24:00.79]Okay.

[24:33.62]Good.
[24:33.84]Good to know.
[24:34.48]I was like just so angry for no reason.
[24:41.33]I have red paint.
[24:42.13]Okay.
[24:44.52]So when I have red eye, I can walk on red material.

[26:19.94]Unrealistic.
[26:20.56]Oh, yeah.

[34:15.32]I don't think that was loud for you, but whatever.
[34:17.40]Okay.
[34:18.20]Instructions.
[34:20.56]Goal of the game is to survive and destroy the enemy base.
[34:23.66]The game is divided in five ages.
[34:25.88]With the next age, you need XP points.
[34:28.60]To gain these points, you have to kill enemy units.
[34:30.41]Okay?
[34:31.99]You can also gain XP points when one of your units is killed.
[34:34.93]You can also build defenses.
[34:38.01]Finding the balance between defense and offense is the key.
[34:43.41]Wait, is it intentional?
[34:44.51]What?
[34:47.59]What did I do?
[34:50.39]You'll also be able to use a special attack.
[34:53.72]This attack will... What did I do?
[34:55.08]This attack will need time to be available again after you use it.
[35:01.48]Each age has its own special attack.
[35:04.54]Sure.
[35:05.26]You cannot repair your base, but it will gain health points every time you evolve to the next age.
[35:08.38]Protect your base at all costs.
[35:13.90]Okay.
[35:16.24]Like, 1998 flash games are the same thing as 1998 video games.
[35:21.45]They're insanely hard.
[35:23.05]And if I do impossible, it's actually impossible and you can't win.
[35:27.71]Your volume is down?
[35:29.21]No, it's not.
[35:32.61]It's not.

[60:29.61]You need a shit ton of fodder.
[60:33.89]Alright, hold on.
[60:41.40]I feel like I'm playing a game of StarCraft.
[60:44.85]We both- It's 1v1 and we both own 50% of the entire fucking map each.
[60:51.15]We have thousands of units.
[60:52.99]At some point- Do you just call a truce?
[61:02.29]Like, after like four or five hours when it's like the game balance makes it impossible for anyone to win.
[61:07.59]The only way you win in a game like that in StarCraft or WarCraft is if somebody's parents call them.
[61:14.42]Because they're, like, concerned because it's been, like, four hours.
[61:16.30]You know what I mean?
[61:17.34]Like, Dave?
[61:19.18]David?
[61:20.32]Mom?
[61:21.14]What are you?
[61:21.48]That's all it takes.
[61:22.32]That time.
[61:22.98]That's the amount of time.
[61:23.58]That's it.
[61:23.80]It's over.
[61:24.26]You lost.
[61:25.81]When that happens, that's how you decide.
[61:34.23]So, I'm just going to spam God's Blades then.
[61:37.55]Just make a million basic units.
[61:39.72]Whatever.
[61:40.06]I'll try it.
[61:51.34]This is feeding.
[62:00.90]Feeding.
[62:07.00]It's not a good plan.
[62:14.25]This is just what it feels like to be lane minions.
[62:19.31]There's two giant fucking structures, two huge mo- Wait, why are they damaged?
[62:27.06]How did I do that damage?
[62:29.08]Alright, I'm going in with super soldiers only.
[62:35.42]Your towers are killing him.
[62:36.96]How?
[62:39.44]How the fuck is that happening?
[62:52.05]It's overshooting people sometimes.
[63:00.68]Tanks.
[63:01.28]Only tanks.
[63:13.12]I must sell the ions and use the cash for soldiers.
[63:15.80]No, that's the only thing keeping me alive.
[63:17.16]We're just waiting.
[63:21.07]Just waiting to kill each other.
[63:32.02]Sell, replace them.
[63:33.98]No, I can't.
[63:39.58]What the fuck?
[63:42.78]Just let him die.
[63:43.54]I'm just going to farm to like 5 million gold.
[63:49.31]Now buy the super soldier.

[76:15.87]And then the teacher came over and said, you kind of, you're trying to gauge how long it was going to take for the teacher to go around the computer room and come over and put the hand over on the desk and lean over and look at what you were doing and see how good your work was doing.
[76:29.59]And you timed it.
[76:32.57]You know, it was about four or five minutes from when they were in the corner of the room.
[76:36.62]They went and checked on every single person.
[76:38.52]You timed it a few times.
[76:39.80]It was about four and a half minutes.
[76:43.62]Right there.
[76:49.29]That's gonna hit me right in the head.

[106:08.73]I should have won that last one, but it was just, there's too far.
[106:13.94]I gotta kill the guy up top first.
[106:15.12]He's the biggest pain in the ass.
[106:17.68]Okay.
[106:18.64]We're talking about, like, the tree's butt.
[106:21.98]Right where, like, the tree is bending over.
[106:24.51]Like, this is the tree's, like, butt.
[106:27.33]Tree's butt with this much power.
[106:33.01]Right above the tree's butt.

[106:39.16]Okay.
[106:39.72]Alright.
[106:40.22]It's alright.
[106:40.84]And then look, it worked out just fine.
[106:45.44]We gotta go a little bit lower now.
[106:46.98]From the tree's butt, we gotta go down to the tree's, you know, down to the tree's like thigh.
[106:50.56]Right here.

[107:08.57]That was the thigh.
[107:10.01]And we could go to the back.
[107:11.29]The tree's back is going to be a good one right there.
[107:13.15]Right there on the jet ski.
[107:13.99]Yes, yes, yes.
[107:14.67]Knock him off.
[107:15.05]Knock that motherfucker off the tree.

[107:46.28]Okay.
[107:47.60]I'm going to say it's right there.

[107:58.59]He's alive.
[108:20.39]I have to start the whole thing over.
[108:21.86]No, don't.
[108:23.84]Oh, my God.
[108:24.49]That was a little bit.
[108:51.19]Hold R to restart.
[108:52.51]Does that work?
[108:58.67]It's 100 damage if you get hit by that directly.
[109:01.57]What the fuck?
[109:04.83]I just hit R and it didn't do anything.
[109:05.94]You lied.
[109:06.34]Oh my god.
[109:10.74]This whole game has been easy until the final level.
[109:14.92]I just ran out of missiles.
[109:17.66]I'm not even paying attention anymore.
[109:19.94]I have to just restart.
[109:20.74]Do it again.
[109:26.17]It's control W. No, I don't want to... No, don't do that.
[109:28.33]Alright, I'm... I didn't... I didn't think I was going to be here for this long.
[109:44.72]I didn't think I was going to do this for this long.
[109:46.46]Guy in the jet ski.
[109:47.60]Restart.
[109:47.88]Just...
[109:57.81]I don't even care.
[110:24.62]He's losing hair.
[110:25.56]It's so stupid.
[110:28.84]Why?
[110:35.42]Why?
[110:44.85]All of a sudden, they're just bad at the game now.
[110:47.27]Eek, a shark.
[110:48.23]It's going to hit the guy in the tree and it's going to knock him down.
[110:51.23]I'm just...
[110:53.13]How can I be fucking this, like, malding at a 2000, like, 2 flash game?
[111:00.38]I'm just like, I'm tilted.
[111:09.38]What the fuck did that even hit, man?
[111:11.18]What did that even hit?
[111:12.22]Turn the face cam on?
[111:14.04]No, I'm done with clothes on.
[111:15.74]When are you going to gamble on Pokemon cards?
[111:20.42]I don't, I can't do that.
[111:31.21]No, fuck that.
[111:31.83]I'm just going to go get a bunch of baseball cards and open them on screen.

[111:45.58]There it is.
[111:45.88]Knock him in.
[111:46.24]Knock him in.
[111:56.94]That couldn't have been a worse outcome.
[112:05.39]God, I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[112:10.61]You're gonna put clothes on, you're a grown man.
[112:12.33]What, a grown man can't sit in his own house with no clothes on?
[112:14.86]How'd they both die?
[112:17.84]I didn't even look.
[112:22.64]So a grown man in his own home cannot wear, I have to wear a t-shirt and like pants in my house?
[112:30.21]no I could literally run from back and forth from like bedroom to office bedroom to office naked just balls hanging it doesn't matter this is my own place I can do whatever I want I could just sprint back and forth and like break dance in the it doesn't matter that's political
[112:59.83]oh and that's how you start the big one I can literally just go down and I could just go to my fridge open it up and open up a fresh almond milk nude just naked and just chug the thing oh no I can chuck almond milk down in my kitchen I can just chug it naked would you what are you what are you gonna stop me
[113:40.72]Stop talking about this.

[113:42.74]Eventually.
[113:45.34]Alright, this guy is a little bit up.
[113:47.48]That should be it.
[113:48.70]Ladies and gentlemen.
[113:50.08]Everybody relax.
[113:51.44]We have just killed this dickhead in the tree.
[113:54.35]This last guy in the tree is the only guy we have to kill.
[113:57.17]Just do not kill us both in one shot.
[113:59.77]We didn't.
[114:00.47]This is my opportunity.
[114:01.33]I have to hit this.
[114:02.03]I have to hit this guy right now.
[114:05.07]I have to hit him.
[114:07.85]I think it's right here.
[114:09.55]Right there.
[114:12.06]This is it.
[114:12.84]Yeah, I have to hit him hard in the head.
[114:16.16]I think that's it.
[114:17.59]Maybe a little bit lower.
[114:20.71]I think that's it.
[114:21.65]I think it's like right here.
[114:24.45]Right there.
[114:24.85]Oh, power.
[114:26.87]Higher?
[114:27.19]Is that too high?
[114:28.83]I feel like that's too high.

[131:00.72]Okay, I need $250 for that.
[131:04.02]Or I could do power or iron pellets.
[131:18.10]Come on, get him.
[131:20.22]Oh, shit.
[131:20.82]I missed him.
[131:26.00]I command you to rise from the snow and fly.

[140:16.56]It's a great scene.
[140:17.58]That movie's fantastic, by the way.
[140:19.52]One of the best fucking acting performances I've ever seen in my life.
[140:24.12]Re-chat.
[140:31.59]What?
[140:31.97]What are you talking about?
[140:34.93]What happened?
[140:37.56]They put you in.
[140:38.48]What do you mean they put me in?
[140:51.44]Wait a second.
[140:54.02]We can't watch this.
[140:55.73]We can't watch this.
[140:57.71]I'm gonna get in trouble if we watch this.
[141:00.07]I'll show a tiny bit.
[141:02.15]I'm gonna get in trouble.
[141:13.63]What does it say?
[141:14.13]VPN saves the day again!
[141:32.88]VPN saves the day again!
[141:40.85]OH!
[141:41.99]OH MY GOD, IT HAPPENED TWICE!
[141:43.77]OH, IT'S WONDERFUL!
[141:50.56]YES!
[141:53.73]Wait, it- YES!
[142:12.59]Thank God for the VPN.
[142:17.23]Yes!
[142:18.79]We're good.
[142:25.73]But anyways, what is this telling me?
[142:34.10]Saves the day again, it does.
[142:47.33]It's showing why I got it in the first place.
[142:55.58]Why the fuck?
[142:56.54]I can't even... Alright, whatever.
[142:58.76]Don't call him dumb.
[143:00.85]Holy shit, dude.
[143:01.39]I just signed into his computer.
[143:04.65]I'm on his computer right now.
[143:17.61]Okay, so let's just let's go ahead and put this on.
[143:21.03]I can't show this.
[143:22.35]I can't show this.
[143:45.07]Oh, thank God for the fucking VPN, man.
[143:47.38]I was... I'm so happy.
[143:50.22]Why is it doing this?
[144:02.22]Okay, let's keep going.
[144:07.48]You never said what VPN you use?
[144:10.50]Um, no.
[144:11.24]Because, I don't know.
[144:12.72]I've got to make sure it works.
[144:17.11]No, computer.
[144:17.85]Don't tell me, don't tell me, what?
[144:19.47]Uh-oh.
[144:34.72]Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.
[144:35.78]I have the wrong booster on.
[144:40.16]Wait, what?
[144:41.30]Oh.
[144:43.80]Oh, shit, it is worse.
[144:46.80]Oops.
[144:47.50]Alright, I have to break this.
[145:05.01]There it is.
[145:05.39]Alright, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[145:08.89]Destroy it.
[145:13.81]By the spring?
[145:14.53]Will that help?
[145:20.81]There's literally nothing but thick pics of Gerbo on his computer.
[145:27.67]Why would I have my own images of me?
[145:29.86]Like, that's weird.
[145:35.26]Go to the next page?
[145:37.68]Um... How do I get on the... Is there a next page here?
[145:40.46]Okay, I need to destroy the wall.
[145:59.04]Alright, we're gonna glide for a little bit.
[146:06.33]I want distance.
[146:06.89]Alright, we're gonna go over that.
[146:07.67]Alright, cleared that.
[146:11.11]Out of fuel, but it's okay.
[146:18.70]What's in front?
[146:19.22]The wall?
[146:27.33]Stop stalling.
[146:28.27]What?
[146:29.33]I'm trying to stay in the... I'm trying to get the distance award.
[146:31.31]Yeah, look, the distance duration three.
[146:45.10]How much have we lost?
[146:46.02]All right, we needed a plank.
[146:49.11]How about good old sled?
[146:53.39]Or how about, wait, L bouncy?
[146:57.08]This is fast.
[146:59.68]Takeoff.
[147:02.02]Hell bouncy?
[147:06.26]Another glider.
[147:06.92]Okay.
[147:09.44]Hang glider.
[147:11.98]Ultralight trike.
[147:14.62]Pop speed in flight.
[147:16.98]Umbrella.
[147:19.40]Are they tricycle?
[147:23.96]Tricycle.
[147:28.52]Alright, let's go.
[147:32.91]This is huge.
[147:37.21]Oh my god.
[147:38.09]Okay, well, I mean, I burnt all the fuel.
[147:44.47]That is so scary.
[147:50.27]I don't know why.
[147:52.49]Like, the music changed.
[148:14.30]Whoa.
[148:18.65]Whoa.
[148:24.71]Whoa.
[148:33.15]Whoa.
[148:34.49]Whoa.
[148:35.29]Oh, that's the wall.
[148:40.71]Don't slow down.
[148:41.54]I'm trying to stay in the air.
[148:46.26]Wait, what about bonus shop?
[148:47.10]Let me see.
[148:51.82]10% reduction of the drag effect with red zones.
[148:54.10]Yeah.
[148:58.40]Less gravity.
[149:00.27]Fuel capacity.
[149:04.29]See how far you've traveled.
[149:05.51]Oh, it's a little, uh, uh, ommeter.
[149:41.17]Stop going up?
[149:49.84]Oh, my God.
[149:50.42]Did you hear that noise?
[149:51.24]Oh, air balloon.
[149:51.78]Rocket firework.
[149:57.00]Yes.
[149:57.40]Try it.
[150:17.64]Rocket.
[150:20.28]Holy shit.
[150:22.79]Oh boy.
[150:31.03]Too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast.
[150:34.40]I need more damage.
[150:39.58]Need damage.
[150:48.42]There we go.
[150:48.80]Cast iron.
[150:49.32]Let's go.
[150:49.92]And fire.
[150:52.09]Speed.
[151:13.62]Right into the wall.
[151:14.24]This should break it.
[151:14.78]This is gonna break it.
[151:16.28]It's gonna break it.
[151:18.72]150 miles per hour.
[151:19.60]We're getting close to... What happened?
[151:23.48]Where am I?
[151:24.74]Did I go through it?
[151:26.78]I guess I went through it.
[151:27.48]I beat the mountain.
[151:38.51]Oh, nice.
[151:43.12]I got tons of extra gold.
[151:45.00]Try to go higher.
[151:47.83]Alright, hold on.
[151:48.63]Wait.
[151:51.25]Where should I put this into?
[151:54.87]Ooh.
[151:54.95]Ooh.
[152:01.83]I want that one.
[152:02.37]I need to destroy the iceberg and the wall.
[152:14.89]Is that how many times I try to go higher?
[152:16.33]I blew it.
[152:20.37]Oh.
[152:22.47]Okay.
[152:22.99]I guess I've got... Honey, speed four.
[152:27.83]Okay.
[152:39.20]Watch this shit.
[152:45.47]Alright, even it out.
[152:53.19]I'm still really high in the air.
[152:55.09]There's the mountain.
[153:01.16]What did I do?
[153:01.78]I didn't break the mountain yet.
[153:05.46]Did I?
[153:10.76]Did I break the mountain already?
[153:13.80]Oh, I did.
[153:14.20]Okay, never mind.
[153:27.69]Yes.
[153:28.81]Okay, I'm at 200 feet.
[153:29.37]150.
[153:29.39]Speed.
[153:29.59]Very fast.
[153:33.44]Getting close to the ground though.
[153:38.34]There's the iceberg.
[153:56.29]How high are you?
[153:57.14]The children's game is perplexing.
[153:59.00]I'm doing just fine.
[153:59.72]I think I need to do this.
[154:09.20]Yeah.
[154:09.46]Let's go.
[154:10.91]Again.
[154:11.41]Get a new thruster.
[154:26.19]Get rid of the rocket?
[154:27.01]Re!
[154:43.49]I like this pace.
[154:44.41]This is a good pace.
[154:49.00]This is very fast.
[154:50.40]Oh my god.
[154:51.02]I'm breaking the barrier here.
[154:52.76]Come on.
[154:53.28]Where is it?
[154:53.76]It's right there.
[154:57.52]Oh, what?
[154:58.04]All right.
[155:06.12]Get rid of the firework.
[155:08.48]This is a four shot.
[155:12.39]I'll try this.
[155:36.26]Wasted.
[155:39.00]Kind of.
[155:40.10]I'm pretty high.
[155:40.62]I'm high on the other.
[155:41.16]I'm okay.
[155:44.89]Is it worse?
[155:45.77]That's alright.
[155:46.33]No, I'm good.
[155:46.67]I'm good.
[155:48.19]Look at the speed.
[155:48.79]Are you kidding me?
[155:53.82]Getting close to the ground.
[155:54.84]There it is.
[155:55.14]Destroyed it.
[155:58.02]What's next?
[155:58.68]The wall, right?
[156:05.20]Okay, I need, uh, what do I need?
[156:14.35]1,500.
[156:14.37]That's good.
[156:16.61]What do we got?
[156:17.27]Ooh.
[156:19.94]High tech.
[156:22.32]Ultralight aircraft.
[156:26.70]Propeller.
[156:29.16]Whirlybird 512.
[156:34.97]Trying this one.
[156:36.31]Let's give it a try.
[156:39.20]Uploading ads.
[156:42.58]What the fuck?
[156:44.24]Uh... Um...
[157:09.99]Sending supplies.
[157:11.99]What just happened?
[157:13.93]I don't even know where I'm going.
[157:19.40]I'm 700 feet in the air.
[157:28.22]I can't.
[157:29.24]How do I fly?
[157:30.00]I'm going into space.
[157:33.02]Okay.
[157:35.91]What happens when I run out of propeller fuel?
[157:37.41]I just fall?
[157:39.89]Oh my goodness.
[157:40.69]Okay.
[157:53.64]Where's the eject button?
[158:00.06]I actually hit it.
[158:10.46]Alright, I want to get a different booster.
[158:14.16]A liftoff.
[158:15.14]Yep.
[158:17.38]Okay, let me go back to the bonus shop.
[158:21.68]And I want to do... Adjust the angle of the ramp.
[158:27.63]That sounds kind of ridiculous.
[158:29.13]I'll try it.
[158:42.45]Alright, we're doing a mega ramp.
[158:49.89]Increasing power.
[158:50.69]And... And, I don't know.
[159:28.78]There's the iceberg.
[159:34.91]More of an angle?
[159:35.73]Oh, Jesus.
[159:49.48]There's the wall.
[159:51.94]Distance 5.
[159:55.62]I might hit it.
[159:56.34]Come on.
[159:57.76]It's going to be close.
[160:00.18]I hit it.
[160:00.50]Okay, let's do... No, no damage.
[160:12.27]Should I do... Let's just Mac this out.
[160:19.81]I'm not going to waste all my shit.
[160:25.56]And he won't draft a bat.
[160:26.72]And then let's go.
[160:30.64]The propeller's always going to be doing this, so you know what to do.
[160:32.52]Again, again.
[160:32.86]More, more, more, more.
[160:33.44]Speed, speed, speed, speed, speed.
[160:36.74]Sorry.
[160:37.54]Fucking demon took over for me.
[160:38.64]The goblin took over.
[160:41.88]More speed.
[160:42.58]More.
[160:50.93]More.
[160:58.72]Where's that wall?
[161:03.54]Here it comes.
[161:04.48]Right there.
[161:05.58]I'm not gonna hit it.
[161:06.96]I might.
[161:07.26]Actually, no.
[161:07.82]I think I might.
[161:08.22]200.
[161:08.24]200 feet.
[161:09.36]150.
[161:09.38]100.
[161:09.40]200.
[161:09.42]You are boosting down.
[161:09.90]Shit.
[161:10.02]It's okay.
[161:11.13]I got some money.
[161:29.42]Umbrella.
[161:31.16]Color.
[161:33.30]Zeppelin.
[161:35.88]Ultralight aircraft.
[161:39.71]Alright, I'll get ultralight aircraft.
[161:43.25]Save the money.
[161:58.51]Let's go.
[161:59.44]700 feet in the air.
[162:00.70]Fast as fuck.
[162:14.92]I'm crashing into that wall right now.
[162:25.43]200 miles per hour.
[162:26.29]It's going to break.
[162:28.23]Am I angling down?
[162:29.11]I don't know.
[162:31.13]It'll be easier to smash into stuff.
[162:36.37]600.
[162:36.41]Come on!
[162:36.93]Go, go, go, go, go!
[162:41.37]No!
[162:45.21]Lift!
[162:47.21]I can't lift.
[162:47.75]It's alright.
[162:48.67]I'm getting a new thing anyways.
[162:49.72]Fuck.
[162:52.20]Just do a front flip.
[162:56.42]I just wanted money to get the other thing anyways.
[162:58.97]Okay, let's get it.
[163:01.25]Ultralight aircraft.
[163:06.78]And... This is the best thing I can get, right?
[163:10.58]I guess I could do, like, boom, box.
[163:15.11]What about thrusters?
[163:16.31]Is this the best thing I can get?
[163:17.17]I don't know.
[163:19.57]Alright, let's give it a try.
[163:32.32]Dude, this thing's going over 300 miles per hour.
[163:34.36]Holy shit.
[163:42.00]Oh, my God.
[163:42.97]This is going so... I missed the iceberg.
[163:46.03]What happened?
[163:46.37]Did I skim off the ground?
[163:47.31]I'm not trying to hit the iceberg.
[164:08.23]He just bounced again.
[164:13.45]What is going on here?
[164:14.45]Change the ramp?
[164:24.81]Oh, that's a good idea.
[164:28.45]Like that, right?
[164:33.29]Like this?
[164:33.67]Somewhere in the middle?
[164:45.47]Omega.
[164:47.77]Omega.
[165:00.74]Alright, we're going to just skim for a little bit.
[165:11.11]There we go.
[165:11.57]Look at that.
[165:17.88]And look at that.
[165:18.48]Okay.
[165:28.39]Couple more times.
[165:30.31]Need fuel.
[165:54.07]I'm testing a theory out here.
[166:01.01]Theory busted.
[166:03.01]Theory busted.
[166:03.83]Theory busted.
[166:04.61]Theory busted.
[166:05.53]Theory busted.
[166:20.69]Get the Omega.
[166:22.51]The Omega catalog.
[166:25.72]One extra upgrade in every possible aspect.
[166:28.06]I need a thousand points.
[166:41.45]All right, let's stay at around like 250, 300.
[166:42.89]This looks good to me.
[166:56.27]Okay, looking good.
[167:07.64]Oh shit, 370.
[167:08.76]Okay, crashed right into it going so fast.
[167:11.90]All right.
[167:12.20]Okay, what do I need?
[167:20.58]I got 10,000.
[167:20.82]Okay, I need a little more.
[167:27.69]A little more.
[167:28.07]I need some more fuel.
[167:29.15]Alright, save it.
[167:40.15]Halo Germo.
[167:40.79]I will, I will, I will.
[167:48.51]I'm going to save two rockets.
[167:55.64]There's one.
[167:58.38]I'm gonna do it right before we crash.
[168:02.34]Oh boy.
[168:03.58]Okay, pull up.
[168:05.18]Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up right now.
[168:14.71]Okay, payload.
[168:18.15]What are we talking about?
[168:25.59]Just get the payload.
[168:30.23]Power power power power power.
[168:32.27]Why'd I do that?
[168:35.37]What do you mean?
[169:00.40]Okay, I'm going to get some speed and I'm going to pull up.
[169:05.56]What did I destroy?
[169:06.24]Something?
[169:07.26]What did I destroy?
[169:08.24]Iceberg?
[169:11.64]Got all my rockets.
[169:15.37]Go through all.
[169:19.09]Wait, what just happened?
[169:20.53]I skipped off the ground.
[169:24.09]It's a break.
[169:24.67]This is going to break.
[169:27.95]Three, two, one.
[169:29.03]There it goes.
[169:30.73]Did I win?
[169:42.69]Nice.
[169:42.99]A penguin.
[169:48.48]Get revenge on those pesky icebergs.
[169:52.30]Mission accomplished.
[169:58.26]Penguins stink.
[169:59.10]What kind of stupid non-flying animal calls itself a bird?
[170:01.52]Give up and die.
[170:13.00]What is this?
[170:24.59]Congratulations.
[170:25.59]Haha, not bad.
[170:26.47]It's alright.
[170:28.95]Cool.
[170:32.87]Classic mode has been unlocked.
[170:41.10]So what does that do?
[170:41.66]Go play Learn to Fly 3.
[170:46.92]No, I... Let's hold on to that one.
[170:49.98]I'll do that one another time.
[170:53.22]Where else are we going to go?
[170:54.24]Skywire.
[170:54.98]Yeah, I promised I was going to play Skywire.
[170:57.51]Let's do Skywire.
[171:11.02]Here it comes.
[171:17.75]What other time?
[171:18.51]Flash is going to end.
[171:19.91]We'll do this again soon.

[191:13.20]Sorry.
[191:13.59]Shit.
[191:14.37]Do it again.
[191:15.17]So wait, I have to do like this?
[191:17.25]No, I don't get it.
[191:19.09]I have to hit him with a hammer.
[191:20.99]You like knock him out, right?
[191:40.03]Soft brain tissue.
[191:43.81]That's what I tried before.
[191:45.23]Yeah, I did it.

[192:38.55]So it's a little... Thank you very much.
[192:39.91]I'll take a first try.
[192:44.69]Break it.
[192:45.03]Okay, who's next?
[192:53.50]There's a rope here.
[192:56.23]So I'm gonna assume we gotta cut this, and it's gonna swing.
[192:59.16]And then we cut the rope.
[193:02.40]And there it is.
[193:02.92]Okay.
[193:03.22]Can you break that?
[193:05.66]And then drop this motherfucker right here.

[193:26.28]Fill this big gap here.
[193:27.72]Cool.
[193:31.88]And then we gotta break this.
[193:34.24]Just gotta make a bridge.
[193:36.43]So if I go like this, will it fall that way?

[194:19.70]So, get out of the way.
[194:23.92]All this crap's gotta get out of the way.
[194:34.65]That.

[194:49.26]It's breaking.
[194:49.78]This actually might be good.
[194:53.10]He might go off of it.
[194:54.07]Like a ramp.
[194:54.45]Like a jump.
[194:55.95]Keep going.
[194:56.67]Over that.
[194:58.29]Over the jump.
[195:01.47]Yes!
[195:01.87]It worked.

[195:33.48]I'm gonna save those, right?
[195:35.78]Okay, we're gonna- we have to hit them with the hammer so it goes boink.
[195:41.11]These runes are very powerful and dangerous.
[195:42.89]These creatures are also harmful.
[195:53.50]I don't know why I did that.
[195:54.90]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[195:55.78]Oops.
[195:56.04]Alright.
[195:56.42]Oh.

[196:41.04]What if he gets on the boat?
[196:42.00]Can he get killed?
[196:43.99]He kills him.
[196:45.61]Oh, nice.
[196:45.93]Okay, that's cool.

[202:36.96]Flips.
[202:39.43]Ow.
[202:40.83]The free trial ran out.
[202:43.05]I gotta get in some of those rings.
[202:56.01]Ooh, got some fish friends.
[202:58.41]Fuck.
[203:04.25]I want speed.
[203:18.24]No!
[203:26.40]You need violence.
[203:27.26]Get more fish, friends.
[203:30.22]I need... Where are those rings at?
[203:31.43]There's some over there.
[203:33.99]Hold on.
[203:34.97]All right.
[203:38.99]I'm going to get this ring.
[203:39.69]Ready?
[203:42.52]Shit, I missed it.
[203:44.69]There it is.
[203:45.47]No, it moved.
[203:46.07]Fuck.
[203:59.64]I got too concerned.
[204:00.56]And there's the flip!
[204:04.80]I have to get to space.
[204:05.72]I need to do a hyper-advanced technique.
[204:09.47]What the fuck?
[204:22.87]Ow, my chest.
[204:23.95]That hurt.
[204:24.87]That actually really hurt.
[204:25.74]I don't know why I thought that was that funny.
[204:27.46]Alright, one more try.
[204:31.66]Last try.
[204:47.34]Ooh, that was good!
[204:55.61]Stop doing the tail slide!
[205:22.67]I'm just bad at- I can't do this shit.
[205:24.89]I don't like using the keyboard.
[205:25.84]Give me a controller.
[205:27.64]Finish it!
[205:56.55]Oh, finish it.
[206:06.06]Oh, fuck.
[206:06.66]That hurt.
[206:07.32]God damn it.
[206:12.28]I messed it up.
[206:13.16]Oh well.
[206:26.74]One more time.
[206:27.10]I want to do it one more time.
[206:27.84]Alright, one more time.
[206:36.23]That's it.
[206:36.51]Last one.
[206:49.50]Fish.
[206:49.94]Good.
[206:50.20]Got some fish friends.
[207:07.31]Get up there in the space.
[207:18.02]What?
[207:23.70]Where are the firearms games?
[207:26.74]Stop it.
[207:33.08]I'm playing dolphin diving.
[207:40.32]You can do with some, no, less violence today, okay?
[207:47.89]I know, I gotta keep combos going to get out of the water faster.
[208:01.73]Fuck you game, fuck you!
[208:03.51]Alright, what's the next one?
[208:21.29]What's the next one?
[208:23.19]This game's so fun, but I can't do it.
[208:24.77]I don't like the keyboard.
[208:26.01]I hate using the keyboard for everything.
[208:36.54]He's dead.
[208:40.10]He didn't even make it to space.
[208:41.12]I can't.
[208:41.58]I can't do it.
[208:52.09]What's a good quick one?
[208:53.25]I only got like 30 minutes before I gotta go.
[208:57.99]Rubble Trouble.
[208:58.65]Alright, yeah.
[208:59.04]That's the one we were gonna do.
[208:59.96]We're gonna do Rubble Trouble.
[209:15.28]murloc rpg hold on to some of these I love this I love streaming
[209:38.31]I'm acting like I just started.
[209:39.90]I love streaming.
[209:40.88]Hold on to somebody's new games, guys.
[209:42.06]Maybe I'll come back in a couple months.
[209:43.22]I kind of like it.
[209:44.44]All right, this is Rubble Trouble New York.
[209:48.40]What are you doing?
[209:50.72]All right, lads, we've got to make $1,100 to complete the job.
[209:59.99]Okay, boss, we'll trigger the explosives with sticks of nitroglycerin.
[210:05.24]Just remember, we get money for every bit that crumbles to dust, so destroy it all.
[210:08.72]Press the tool button at the bottom to use the nitro.
[210:11.54]Okay.
[210:15.96]Oh, uh... Hold on.
[210:18.59]I have less of the game.
[210:20.69]Okay.
[210:36.89]Now click this button to select your tool.
[210:38.58]Click anywhere to create an explosion.
[210:39.88]Alright, right here.
[210:41.56]Right on the edge.
[210:42.96]Click anywhere to create an explosion.
[210:46.56]Right here on the edge.
[210:47.16]Alright, that was easy.
[210:50.83]You just cropped it.
[211:06.32]Drill time.
[211:07.40]Serious damage coming up, boss.
[211:10.56]Barry, the drill is too expensive.
[211:12.48]Don't waste it.
[211:13.22]The drill can be used from above as well.
[211:15.64]Neat, huh?
[211:16.16]The drill will target the nearest block that is to the side or below the mouse pointer.
[211:24.54]It explodes when it can't drill.
[211:25.78]Okay.
[211:27.62]Cool.
[211:28.08]Cool.
[211:39.67]Very cool.
[211:41.27]Cool.
[211:41.57]Cool.
[211:41.97]Try again.
[211:44.75]Cool.
[212:12.50]Try again.
[212:13.44]Cool!
[212:36.96]He doesn't know this is a video game.
[212:39.24]Boss, I've done a modification to the cement mixer.
[212:42.10]Gary, what have you made this time?
[212:44.06]A cannon.
[212:44.68]A cement mixer that fires cannonballs.
[212:46.44]It's easy to use.
[212:47.04]Just push the cannon, find a good angle, and hold down the mouse button until you have enough power.
[212:52.67]Oh, dear.
[212:54.05]Try to destroy just the building this time and keep away from my van.
[212:57.09]Okay, cannonball.
[213:03.84]Okay, so just destroy just the building.
[213:05.84]Don't touch my van.
[213:07.16]I did something wrong.
[213:11.57]What?
[213:11.83]Where'd it go?
[213:31.97]Oh shit, did I do it?
[213:33.85]Hey, hey, I'm doing it!
[213:34.77]I did it!
[213:35.27]Get the fuck in there.
[213:36.45]Okay.
[213:36.73]Just give me a break.
[214:04.66]More!
[214:06.22]Whoops.
[214:10.08]Omega Lul, Raft Wars 2.
[214:12.58]Barry, use the heli- Wait, what?
[214:15.60]Cool, thanks boss.
[214:16.27]Remember, it runs out of fuel quickly.
[214:17.67]Barry, because it's heavy, it'll smash through every glass everywhere.
[214:22.99]Position the wrecking ball with the mouse pointer.
[214:24.41]Click to begin.
[214:25.11]You have a limited amount of time to use the wrecking ball, so get swinging.
[214:37.69]Get in there.
[214:41.08]Whatever.
[214:41.82]Get in there.
[214:42.54]You're killing me.
[215:01.19]It moves around way too fast.
[215:02.51]I got it all, right?
[215:17.06]I got it?
[215:17.42]Alright, next level.
[215:21.52]What?
[215:21.76]Barry, look.
[215:22.74]What is it, boss?
[215:24.34]Oh, ah.
[215:25.34]Sorry, guys.
[215:25.80]I can't get down.
[215:27.16]We have no time for this.
[215:28.06]Get your silly brother to the floor without injuring him.
[216:08.92]Alright, so hold on.
[216:20.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:22.71]Oh, wait, wait.
[216:23.19]He's okay.
[216:32.01]He's almost on the floor.
[216:32.69]Hold on.
[216:48.49]I don't even... I don't like these kind of games.
[217:20.11]Because I've found a missile launcher.
[217:21.53]Evan finds a lot of things.
[217:24.05]Yeah, I don't want to lose my brain.
[217:25.27]I just want to sprint as fast as I can into a wall and smash my head into it.
[217:29.37]I mean, I... Do puzzles and, like, figure out what to, like, what, like, pillar to... No, no, no, no.
[217:33.61]Put your head down.
[217:34.80]Run as fast as I can and head into a wall.
[217:36.42]Break through the wall.
[217:42.12]Okay, position the launcher with the mouse pointer.
[217:43.94]Click to place the vehicle.
[217:45.84]Then click again to launch missile.
[217:47.70]Steer the missile with the mouse.
[217:51.05]Okay.
[217:51.29]That's fun.
[217:51.85]I like that part.
[217:53.15]What?
[217:53.37]Oh shit, it already went.
[217:54.76]It's like Metal Gear Solid.
[218:17.68]I like that one.
[218:18.20]That was fun because I was just putting my head down and running into a wall as far as I can and exploding it.
[218:21.58]Turn the shitty music off.
[218:25.30]It's not that.
[218:25.74]What?
[218:27.84]Don't let any debris hit the... That's what they meant.
[218:38.59]Okay.
[218:41.17]You guys don't like that?
[218:42.03]You don't?
[218:57.54]Don't!
[218:57.96]Okay, we're good.
[219:05.25]It's complete, right?
[219:05.85]Yeah, okay.
[219:09.65]Cousin, I haven't found a plane.
[219:10.99]It can destroy a lot of stuff quickly.
[219:13.41]Don't blow me up, bruv.
[219:15.05]Hmm, I'll help push stuff around with the helicopter.
[219:18.17]Okay, but Gary, you can only bomb stuff in the yellow barriers.
[219:23.20]I guess you should get Gary down from there.
[219:38.63]he's british all right watch out watch out watch out watch out larry larry larry larry you're fine
[220:08.53]Alright, he's going to come down nice and softly.
[220:10.63]Okay, now I just need to wrecking ball.
[220:19.21]Holy fuck, I just squished him.
[220:23.10]Damn it!
[220:23.76]I knew I was going to do that.
[220:25.16]Damn it!
[220:26.24]I don't like this.
[220:27.82]Give me another one.
[220:29.80]Give me another one.
[220:30.36]Give me another one.
[220:38.30]Save him!
[220:38.86]I thought he was gonna be safe.
[220:40.74]Fuck.
[220:40.96]Bad Ice Cream 3.
[220:42.00]I tried to play that earlier.
[220:43.56]I couldn't get it to work.
[221:09.93]Just trying to kill him one more time.
[221:10.87]Yeah, I'm done with this one.
[221:13.89]I usually don't like to play these kinds of games.
[221:15.31]They're cute and they're fun, but no, not for me.
[221:17.75]What's next?
[221:18.99]Motherload?
[221:19.71]Okay, Motherload.
[221:27.73]Motherload Flash game.
[221:31.81]Is it also on Nitro?
[221:32.47]Okay.
[221:37.17]Okay.
[221:39.42]Enable flash.
[221:42.92]Alright, this is a tiny fucking window.
[221:44.86]Can I like full screen this?
[221:51.42]This is so small.
[221:56.40]Mother load.
[221:59.53]Mother load gold edition?
[222:07.20]Back when monitors had 640x480 resolution.
[222:21.10]Okay.
[222:22.10]Need to move this.
[222:23.04]That looks good.
[222:24.86]Alright, what is this game?
[222:26.92]The full screen button?
[222:28.46]Um... MiniClip says, switch to focus mode to concentrate.
[222:32.98]This will restart your game.
[222:35.24]Okay.
[222:35.96]Full screen mode.
[222:39.14]Did it work?
[222:39.46]I mean, it sort of worked.
[222:44.96]A little better.
[222:50.63]Kind of exactly the same, though.
[222:58.58]How's this one?
[222:58.94]Is this game good?
[223:07.41]Meat and fuck.
[223:08.41]I'm not gonna play meat and fuck adventure.
[223:12.05]I'm gonna get... I will be removed from this platform.
[223:15.36]I'm not gonna play that.
[223:16.14]Control your pod using the arrow keys.
[223:21.62]Or if it's more comfortable, the WASD, okay?
[223:24.24]Your drill deploys automatically if you move into diggable material.
[223:28.49]You cannot drill straight up.
[223:30.25]You can trade minerals in your storage bay for cold hard cash.
[223:34.21]Ooh!
[223:35.43]I think I'm gonna like this.
[223:36.91]Let's go.
[223:39.80]Loud.
[223:44.14]Transmission.
[223:45.95]Transmission.
[223:47.53]We forgot to refuel you on the way over.
[223:49.63]Drive over to the fuel station and fill her up.
[223:51.65]It's been almost impossible to hire decent miners on Mars since all the strange activities started happening around here.
[223:59.03]That's why we're willing to pay you at a premium for your services.
[224:02.85]I've given you a basic mining machine to get you started with.
[224:05.43]Unfortunately, you'll be on your own from this point onward, as the settlers, who were lucky enough to escape with their lives, have fled to safety.
[224:12.37]However, all the shops here have been computerized, so you'll still be able to sell your minerals, fuel up, upgrade your pod, and buy special items.
[224:22.30]Remember, your job is to collect minerals and bring them back to the surface for processing.
[224:26.85]The deeper you dig, the more valuable in minerals you will encounter.
[224:30.11]Don't forget to refuel.
[224:32.99]Good luck.
[224:34.42]His mission terminated.
[224:37.28]Refuel.
[224:39.30]$20.
[224:39.34]Okay, let's go.
[224:41.58]All right.
[224:43.04]$5, $4 purchased.
[224:44.84]It's time to dig.
[224:50.14]All right, what's over there?
[224:50.82]Is that lava or is that minerals?
[224:59.61]Okay, it's minerals.
[225:02.97]Alright, I'm doing alright.
[225:07.44]Ow.
[225:09.50]It's like Dig Dug?
[225:10.28]It's like Dig Dug, but you can sell stuff.
[225:14.34]Ironium.
[225:18.35]Silverium.
[225:20.83]Bronzium.
[225:36.88]Whatever.
[225:37.32]It's okay.
[225:38.82]It's okay.
[225:39.76]It's alright.
[225:40.24]We'll be fine.
[225:43.59]Going down.
[225:44.33]Gold over here.
[225:45.19]Want some money?
[225:46.99]Alright.
[225:47.37]Just be careful.
[226:08.56]Cargo bay full, alright.
[226:10.48]How do I get out of here?
[226:12.48]Oh shit, I can fly.
[226:15.27]Ooh, careful!
[226:18.01]Mineral processing.
[226:18.95]Sell all.
[226:19.19]$620.
[226:19.21]Okay.
[226:19.31]So, how do I upgrade?
[226:42.28]What's over here?
[226:43.74]Junk shop.
[226:44.20]Welcome to the upgrade shop.
[226:45.14]Okay.
[226:47.72]Drill.
[226:49.39]Oh, this is cool.
[226:50.35]Hull.
[226:53.03]17 health.
[226:55.71]30 health.
[227:01.84]Drill.
[227:02.14]750.
[227:02.54]I don't have enough.
[227:03.94]Okay.
[227:04.14]Well, I know this is here.
[227:18.34]Repair?
[227:19.86]Oh, shit.
[227:20.22]I should repair.
[227:20.68]I'll be okay.
[227:22.30]Hold on.
[227:22.56]I'm just gonna get a few more.
[227:23.46]Alright, I'm coming back up.
[227:31.77]I have... How much money?
[227:35.83]Fuel is low.
[227:36.99]Alright, sell all this.
[227:39.99]Refuel.
[227:41.07]Build a tank.
[227:45.01]Uh, what are you... What are you repairing?
[227:49.64]You can save your game.
[227:50.44]Yeah, sure.
[227:55.44]You explode if you run out of fuel.
[227:59.07]Oh, it's right, okay.
[228:01.13]There it is.
[228:01.49]What is this?
[228:03.57]Reserve fuel tank.
[228:04.93]I can't afford any of this.
[228:05.71]Alright, repair.
[228:06.17]I could have just done that.
[228:10.21]Alright, I'm going to buy the other drill.
[228:18.01]This is the Sylvai Drill.
[228:20.85]Nice.
[228:21.69]Nice.
[228:24.75]All right, let's go.
[228:26.05]It was incredibly inefficient.
[228:52.97]Hey, how much?
[228:53.39]I gotta get out fuel.
[228:55.85]I need more.
[228:56.35]I'll pick a fuel tank.
[229:01.97]Hey!
[229:04.09]Get me out of here!
[229:05.71]What the f... Oh!
[229:12.04]Mineral... No, I want to do the...
[229:22.42]Okay.
[229:23.72]Going.
[229:33.22]Oh, wait.
[229:33.42]I want to go down here.
[229:34.24]This is expensive shit.
[229:40.95]500.
[229:41.83]Ow.
[229:47.53]Cargo full.
[229:50.49]Back up.
[229:53.27]What's this game called?
[229:53.99]I don't remember.
[229:57.22]I actually have no idea.
[229:59.02]It's like Load Up or something.
[230:07.32]No, don't get the fuel yet.
[230:12.91]600 bucks, that's it?
[230:19.13]I'm always out of fuel every second.
[230:31.27]Okay, dang.
[230:36.26]Need a bigger tank?
[230:37.04]I need money.
[230:38.52]Okay, I gotta be careful with the fuel.
[230:49.34]These three and I'm going back.
[230:50.82]All right, all right, all right.
[230:53.31]Careful, don't smash your head on the ceiling.
[231:00.40]Alright, process this shit.
[231:01.40]300, that's it?
[231:01.66]Junk shop.
[231:02.00]Hull.
[231:02.10]Engine.
[231:02.26]Fuel tank, here we go.
[231:03.32]750?
[231:03.34]Yeah.
[231:36.89]I'm going this way.
[231:42.86]How much, how much was it?
[231:44.14]50%, 20% or something.
[231:44.94]I'm just going to dig straight down and I'm going to go straight up.
[232:07.89]Give me this.
[232:09.81]Oh my god, I haven't gone to the bathroom.
[232:12.79]I completely forgot to go to the bathroom.
