[00:04.77]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:06.59]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight going to continue my sort of update discussion coverage on the new Team Fortress 2 bread Teleport bread update love and war or whatever you want to call this update This is gonna cover the Demoknight the new Demoknight shield or Demoman shield and
[00:28.38]And before we get started, I just want to say that it's crazy that stuff like this is now possible.
[00:34.60]Watch the ground that I cover here.
[00:37.02]You see where I started?
[00:38.49]I started all the way back where the cart is, and look at where I ended up after four charges.
[00:44.35]In, what, like ten seconds?
[00:47.23]I went back to their spawn, got a medic, pulled up around the left side, escaped with my life intact,
[00:55.30]And I got three kills to show for it.
[00:58.38]This item really just makes you bounce around like a pinball.
[01:01.46]Like, I feel like I'm inside of the Addams Family pinball machine from 93.
[01:05.08]Or whenever the hell that game came out.
[01:07.73]I hope I brought enough quarters, because I want to keep playing like with the Tide Turner.
[01:11.15]Let me like, you know, jingle them all out.
[01:12.97]It's what, 50 cents to continue?
[01:14.53]Hope I get a multiball.
[01:15.95]That's what I feel like when I'm playing with this item.
[01:18.21]And even when you're not using the Tide Turner to... I didn't even explain, like, what the Tide Turner even is.
[01:23.70]The Tide Turner is the shield that is giving the opportunity to do this.
[01:27.71]If you don't know how it works, when you charge somebody and you get a kill while you're charging...
[01:33.29]you are able to immediately charge again, which is why I say you turn into a pinball.
[01:38.34]And also, you get the 25% explosion reduction in damage and fire reduction in damage.
[01:44.42]So it does the same amount of damage reduction as the Splendid Screen, but it also allows you to have 100% turning control.
[01:52.41]You can turn as much as you want with this item.
[01:55.45]The Wii booties, you don't have to put those on.
[01:58.09]This thing totally negates the Wii booties in that regard.
[02:01.17]But that's how the item works.
[02:03.63]On top of it being really good for offensive measures, bouncing around and getting a bunch of kills, the escape mechanism of this item is also really good.
[02:12.44]As a Demoknight before, when you charged into somebody, if there was a bunch of people that you saw, okay, there's a bunch of people on this point, I'm gonna charge in with my Demoknight, and I'm gonna try to get a kill with it.
[02:21.00]Okay, great, you got one kill, now you're just like swinging around blindfolded at like a fucking pi√±ata, like, oh, like, where is it?
[02:27.83]Did you get somebody else?
[02:28.81]Maybe you did.
[02:29.95]but this item allows you to get out.
[02:32.33]So if you charge around a corner and you get like another demo or you get a scout or something, you can immediately turn around and get out and get to a safe position, which is exactly what I did in the very beginning of this video.
[02:43.50]I got the medic, I got out, and I was totally safe.
[02:47.83]Now, if you have one of the grenade launchers on, obviously that's another way to protect yourself.
[02:52.95]If you turn a corner, you get someone, and there's a bunch of other people, you can try to make something else happen with the grenade launcher.
[02:58.53]But if you just want to get out and keep a streak going, this thing is fantastic for that.
[03:03.43]Because it's pretty difficult to shoot at a charging Demoknight, unless he's coming right at you, or you're a Pyro and you can airblast him.
[03:11.67]They move really damn fast, and sometimes it can be difficult to plan a shot on them.
[03:16.95]And if you want my thoughts as a whole, I think that this shield is incredibly powerful.
[03:22.82]I think it's probably the best shield out of the three right now.
[03:26.74]There are the other ones, sure, the other ones have a good place, but the full turning control and the able to charge after kill I think are so huge that it's really hard at this stage right now to argue against it being the best shield in the game right now.
[03:42.58]And before this video wraps up, I just want to briefly go over this part of the update.
[03:47.30]Because a lot of people had a question about this, and myself included.
[03:50.16]I was asking, okay, we got day one, we got day two, and we didn't get a day three.
[03:55.59]And I was in the crowd of people that a lot of us thought we were going to get the moon base.
[04:00.63]The big new moon base map that Valve was working on on day three.
[04:04.77]And there was no day three.
[04:06.11]So what that means...
[04:08.03]is there's more stuff coming pretty damn soon.
[04:11.70]You got End of the Line, you got this whole Moonbase thing.
[04:14.66]I don't know if End of the Line and the Moonbase map are gonna be tied together part of the same update.
[04:20.60]And if they're not, then that means there's two updates that are coming to this game at a reasonably fast pace.
[04:27.89]I'm going to assume it's not gonna be, oh yeah, End of the Line's gonna be out like next June.
[04:32.49]No, this is gonna be probably pretty soon with all this new stuff, so keep that in mind.
[04:37.60]There's still more things coming to this game, and it's a really great time to be a Team Fortress 2 player.
[04:42.94]I know a lot of people, myself included, thought, okay, we haven't seen anything new in such a long time.
[04:48.47]Does Valve still care?
[04:50.53]And apparently they do so it's good to know that it's really awesome to see this game having a bunch of concurrent players Uh jumping back into the game some new players some old players that are checking it out again And it's awesome.
[05:02.97]And if you're happy to be one of these people that just jumped in for the update Keep playing it's fun.
[05:07.99]But anyways guys that's gonna wrap up the video Thank you all so much for watching just my thoughts on a couple of the things in the update and I'll see you guys all next time and of course
[05:16.99]Take care, everybody.
[05:18.13]And, you know, it's been beautiful out.
[05:19.42]It's been, especially, like, in the United States.
[05:21.86]We're in the middle of, like, pretty much the summertime right now.
[05:24.64]Go, like, throw a frisbee.
[05:26.18]You know, just go outside.
[05:27.55]Go outside and just throw a frisbee.
[05:29.45]And just be like, yeah, just throw a frisbee.
