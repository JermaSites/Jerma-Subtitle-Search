[00:05.48]Let there be bread.
[00:06.52]Thanks for the bread, man.
[00:11.20]Never go hungry again.
[00:12.36]Mmm, that's some good bread.
[00:16.61]Got some ciabatta bread over here.
[00:19.39]Hello, Decenters!
[00:21.42]My name is Etalyx, and I am here today with another episode of Woosh Games Theme Park here in Minecraft with my friend Jerma.
[00:29.20]This is part two.
[00:30.38]You guys wanted it, so you guys got it.
[00:33.01]If you missed part one, check the links in the description of this video, and I strongly encourage you to check out Jerma's YouTube channel.
[00:40.07]The link to his channel is also in the description of this video.
[00:42.72]Anyways, hope you enjoy!
[00:46.46]Jungle Race.
[00:47.60]Players needed at least two basic skills, run and jump.
[00:52.40]I can do those two things.
[00:54.03]I can do both of those two things.
[00:56.95]Okay, so the tree in the distance is the biggest tree in the world.
[01:02.77]We just noticed that it's burning.
[01:04.63]Help us.
[01:05.73]The first team who put away that flame wins the game.
[01:08.51]Now, do you see those Indians right in front of us?
[01:11.33]They won't let us enter the forest unless we pay them.
[01:13.85]You need to find a gold block so we can bribe them.
[01:16.13]Okay, so the objective here is we're going to split up, take a side each, and then we're going to go through this obstacle course, come out.
[01:24.14]There's going to be a bunch of trees.
[01:25.72]You have to find the gold blocks hidden in the trees.
[01:31.02]And then you see this...
[01:33.76]See this thing?
[01:34.30]It says, put... I can barely read it.
[01:36.07]Put the gold block over the red spot.
[01:39.91]So that's... That's where the gold... That's where the gold block goes whenever you find it.
[01:45.39]Alright, so... I am ready.
[01:48.27]Ready?
[01:49.37]So the whole point is we gotta get up to the top of that thing, right?
[01:51.95]Oh yeah.
[01:52.19]Are we going?
[01:53.09]Obstacle course time.
[01:54.17]Oh!
[01:54.47]Go!
[01:54.91]Go!
[01:55.65]Over the slow sand.
[01:56.65]Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[01:57.87]Come on, run.
[01:58.45]Slow sand?
[01:59.09]What the hell?
[02:00.87]Come on, come on, come on.
[02:02.05]Oh, come on, get the sand.
[02:03.00]Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[02:04.72]Oh my god, I'm gonna like puke.
[02:06.02]This is like pulsating.
[02:09.50]Alright, we're on the bridge.
[02:12.65]Jump it.
[02:13.07]No!
[02:13.43]Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[02:14.27]I'm alright, I'm good.
[02:15.19]I'm in the water pool.
[02:17.55]That's not where I wanna be, I wanna be up.
[02:18.99]Swim it up to the surface.
[02:20.57]Oh, I see you, I see you.
[02:21.35]You're like right across from me.
[02:23.45]Oh, I'm gonna win.
[02:24.59]I am absolutely gonna win.
[02:25.69]No, I'm just getting stuck on the vines.
[02:27.25]I refuse to lose.
[02:28.48]I'm getting stuck on all the vines.
[02:30.76]What's going on?
[02:32.16]Where am I?
[02:33.12]Oh, wait, the vines, right?
[02:34.52]The gold blocks are on the highest place of the jungle.
[02:36.90]Destroying leaves is cheating.
[02:38.36]I don't even know what this is.
[02:43.53]Oh, no.
[02:45.18]What?
[02:45.44]What is going on?
[02:46.12]The world is gone.
[02:46.98]What?
[02:47.58]What?
[02:48.19]Oh, what do you know?
[02:50.85]Like half the world is gone.
[02:52.25]Let me just climb up this tree.
[02:53.79]Oh, I fell.
[02:55.17]Okay.
[02:56.17]There's lots of handy ladders placed strategically around these trees.
[02:59.70]Alright, I see this platform.
[03:01.64]Probably supposed to go up there.
[03:04.34]No, get out of the way.
[03:05.16]Up here.
[03:05.48]Up here.
[03:05.72]Up here.
[03:05.92]Up here.
[03:06.10]Come on.
[03:06.42]Come on.
[03:06.66]Come on.
[03:06.84]Come on.
[03:07.08]Come on.
[03:08.33]Come on!
[03:09.17]We're looking for the gold block, right?
[03:10.91]Yeah, there's like, uh, there's like gold blocks somewhere around here.
[03:13.39]Ow!
[03:13.83]Oh, there's a skeleton!
[03:15.99]There's a skeleton on my side.
[03:17.45]Kill him!
[03:19.66]Punch him in his face!
[03:20.54]Yeah, I'm not gonna take time to punch him in his face when I could be trying to find the gold.
[03:24.60]It's gotta be up here.
[03:25.24]Oh, it's right there!
[03:25.76]It's right there!
[03:26.16]Oh my god, go!
[03:26.80]Jump!
[03:28.02]Oh, I got this in the bag.
[03:29.70]I got this in the bag, I think.
[03:30.54]Are you already at the gold?
[03:32.55]I'm, yeah, I'm at the gold right now.
[03:34.69]Oh, man.
[03:35.37]Oh, man.
[03:36.78]Here we go.
[03:37.42]Here we go.
[03:37.88]I'm at the... Take only one gold block and put it in the Indian statue.
[03:41.93]I've already got the gold, son.
[03:43.13]I'm running out here.
[03:43.87]Wait.
[03:44.17]Hold on.
[03:45.09]Where'd it go?
[03:46.39]Give me this.
[03:47.11]Punch it again for another one.
[03:48.95]I got it.
[03:49.35]I got it.
[03:49.63]I'm good.
[03:51.33]Wait.
[03:51.91]I don't know where to go.
[03:53.29]I don't know where to go.
[03:54.43]You gotta jump off the edge.
[03:55.64]Oh, my God.
[03:56.54]No.
[03:56.90]There's a creeper.
[03:57.90]You gotta be kidding me.
[03:58.92]You gotta be kidding me.
[03:59.46]Get away from me.
[04:00.24]Get away from me.
[04:01.70]Oh, my God.
[04:04.15]Okay.
[04:05.22]Alright, I'm winning this thing.
[04:07.18]I am winning this thing.
[04:07.96]I just almost had a legit heart attack right there.
[04:10.02]And this world is ending.
[04:12.48]Where do I go?
[04:12.98]Do you have like a chunk hole somewhere?
[04:17.22]Alright, alright.
[04:19.09]Jerma has forfeited.
[04:20.59]He has died.
[04:21.29]I lost.
[04:25.16]Hooray!
[04:25.70]I don't... Are you there?
[04:27.68]I don't see you.
[04:28.56]I'm... I'm standing right here, yeah.
[04:30.32]Hello!
[04:31.16]Go!
[04:32.98]Wait.
[04:33.84]There's a second part to the challenge.
[04:36.54]Oh, I just... Wait.
[04:38.37]Yeah, there's part two.
[04:39.99]There's part two.
[04:40.69]This is the maze.
[04:42.09]We have to, like, climb.
[04:42.95]Oh, wait.
[04:44.07]We have to, like, figure out how to get out of this maze.
[04:48.51]Oh, how come I'm in yours?
[04:49.81]I'm in your...
[04:51.17]I mean, you're part of the thing.
[04:52.61]No, it meets up in the middle, so we're both... Oh.
[04:56.52]Like, racing against time.
[04:57.86]Hey, hey!
[05:01.62]Get away from me!
[05:03.38]You heathen!
[05:06.36]I went back to the place where I started.
[05:09.39]I'm just, like, wandering around here, trying to find the way out.
[05:12.89]Oh, it's definitely this way.
[05:15.23]Oh, how did you get out there?
[05:17.21]No, I didn't make it!
[05:22.50]Uh, I'm still stuck in the forest.
[05:24.48]You're stuck?
[05:25.02]I can't, like, find my way.
[05:26.24]Stuck in the... Oh, oh, I found you.
[05:28.09]Where am I?
[05:28.57]Oh, you're already climbing up there.
[05:29.67]Wow, okay.
[05:30.41]There's so many, like, things in the way.
[05:31.79]I can't see where I am.
[05:32.71]I'm, like, in the maze.
[05:35.19]No, you're not.
[05:36.67]I can see you climbing that thing.
[05:40.90]Oh, there's an arrow.
[05:41.48]Alright, finally.
[05:42.52]Oh, this is bad.
[05:43.54]I'm gonna fall off of this.
[05:45.06]For sure.
[05:45.74]You certainly are, sir.
[05:47.56]Oh, you already hit the finish.
[05:49.74]Put the fire away.
[05:51.72]Man, that was like the fastest scaling ever.
[05:55.62]How do I... Do I just punch it?
[05:58.48]Did I win?
[06:00.20]Congratulations.
[06:01.02]Thank you for playing.
[06:01.70]I won.
[06:03.20]I get a diamond.
[06:04.82]You win.
[06:06.28]And Flint and steel.
[06:08.62]You kind of won.
[06:09.42]You kind of lost and won.
[06:14.41]I absolutely lost the game.
[06:17.71]You were just... I just failed pretty hardcore right there.
[06:21.23]I am bad at jumping!
[06:22.39]Alright, so where are you?
[06:25.75]I'm still failing at scaling this wall which you so expertly climbed up somehow.
[06:33.88]I'm lighting the trees on fire.
[06:35.36]Is that bad?
[06:37.53]Oh, come on, Etalyx, I'm rooting for you.
[06:39.94]Oh, yeah, man.
[06:41.80]Get out of here.
[06:44.64]No, my life.
[06:46.34]I'm alive still.
[06:48.36]I don't know how, but I am.
[06:52.30]I see you down there.
[06:53.88]Yeah, everything is on fire, so congratulations.
[06:57.29]Do you guys want to know the secret to, like, winning this?
[07:01.21]Did you just, like, go through a wall or something to cheat?
[07:04.01]No, I'm just winning the game.
[07:07.54]I'm about to die.
[07:09.46]Oh, I survived.
[07:11.00]Amazing.
[07:12.60]What's the secret?
[07:13.48]Oh my god.
[07:15.08]I really did light the whole forest on fire.
[07:16.86]I'm sorry.
[07:18.74]Oh, jeez.
[07:19.46]I ruined the game.
[07:20.20]It is all on fire.
[07:20.93]How did you get back here?
[07:26.67]Magic?
[07:26.97]How did you get over there?
[07:27.91]You magician.
[07:32.22]The cool thing about this Woosh Games is... How is that on fire?
[07:40.13]Why is that on fire?
[07:44.01]Why is the dodge bow arena on fire?
[07:47.93]There are clearly some security protocols that are not being adhered to at this theme park.
[07:54.53]That is the only thing I can come up with.
[07:58.52]Dodge bow is on fire.
[08:00.00]We apologize for the technical difficulties.
[08:03.07]If you are currently participating in a round of dodge bow, we encourage you to please remain calm.
[08:09.88]Keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle.
[08:12.70]Security personnel will be along to assist you shortly.
[08:16.38]Egg.
[08:17.88]PvP carts.
[08:19.62]I gotta eat some more bread.
[08:20.80]Gotta eat some more bread.
[08:21.52]Alright, can I have some of your bread?
[08:23.62]Because I lost all mine.
[08:24.59]Oh yeah, you died.
[08:26.79]Thank you, bread fountain.
[08:28.05]I will shower you in loaves.
[08:30.95]So that you may never go hungry.
[08:31.99]Alright.
[08:34.36]Minecart race, agility, and bow skills.
[08:37.94]Also, logs of wood.
[08:40.40]Alright.
[08:41.42]So we minecart race, we just shoot each other when we're on carts?
[08:45.76]Is that how this works?
[08:46.98]This minigame is divided into two stages.
[08:49.06]Each one is based on a different skill.
[08:51.04]One, agility.
[08:51.85]Press buttons to slow down the opponent.
[08:54.37]Push buttons.
[08:55.43]That's all I can get out of that.
[08:56.65]Push lots of buttons.
[08:57.27]Okay, push buttons.
[08:59.15]Hit the player with arrows to kill him.
[09:01.51]You may shoot your opponent only after receiving the bow.
[09:04.61]If you end the race first, you win.
[09:06.49]If you die, that means you lose.
[09:08.05]Have fun.
[09:08.81]Alright.
[09:09.19]So I'm guessing these are our chests with arrows in them we take.
[09:14.30]Yep.
[09:14.52]I'll take a few.
[09:16.42]Okay.
[09:17.60]So do I go exit only?
[09:19.16]Alright.
[09:19.58]So I guess we just go on.
[09:20.50]Do we just run through the middle?
[09:22.72]Through here, maybe?
[09:23.67]Sure.
[09:25.21]I guess so.
[09:26.59]Red racer.
[09:27.21]So red racer.
[09:28.53]I want to be speed racer.
[09:29.57]Can I be speed racer?
[09:31.22]You can be Speed Racer.
[09:32.12]I'll be Blue Racer.
[09:33.12]But Speed Racer, he has a red helmet.
[09:38.42]Like a white and red helmet.
[09:39.48]So I'm going red.
[09:41.61]I'm going blue.
[09:42.47]Get a minecart.
[09:45.05]Place it on the thing.
[09:47.53]Okay.
[09:48.13]So you get in the minecart and then push the button.
[09:51.05]So you get in the minecart and you're in your minecart?
[09:53.65]Yeah, you get in the minecart, turn around, and it says, like, I'm ready with a sign pointing down.
[09:58.07]Oh, it does.
[09:58.47]Okay.
[09:58.69]You ready?
[09:59.50]Let's do it.
[10:01.04]Go.
[10:02.30]Here we go.
[10:03.56]Super minecart fight.
[10:04.70]I love how it has, like, the little s- the little start music before you actually- Wait, what- oh- oh, m- wait!
[10:09.84]I just slowed you down!
[10:11.22]What are you gonna do about that?
[10:13.32]It's- it's slowed me down, you stopped me completely!
[10:16.63]What?
[10:17.91]I'm, like, stuck on this thing.
[10:20.67]I'm still going, man.
[10:21.39]I'm gonna break it.
[10:22.25]I'm still going.
[10:22.93]Wait, am I- I'm s- I'm supposed to break it, aren't I?
[10:25.69]I do- I don't know.
[10:28.40]I have no idea what's going on.
[10:30.32]It's moving without me.
[10:33.66]What is going on?
[10:34.62]I can't move.
[10:36.91]What's hurting me?
[10:38.13]What is punching me?
[10:40.55]Oh, that's you, you son of a bee.
[10:42.85]Alright, I'm... What happened to my... I lost my minecart.
[10:46.21]I don't know where my minecart went.
[10:48.35]Alright, can I just punch the... Hold on, they're gonna do this.
[10:51.25]No, no, it's going without me!
[10:53.85]Okay, here we go.
[10:54.47]Go.
[10:55.81]Go, go, go, go.
[10:58.10]Oh, I shot my own minecart.
[10:59.56]That's what happened.
[11:01.60]How come I got stuck?
[11:03.58]I have no idea.
[11:04.36]I'm gonna put this back down.
[11:07.50]Oh, get in it!
[11:08.35]Oh my god, it's gone without me.
[11:10.33]See you later, minecart.
[11:12.97]Victory is mine.
