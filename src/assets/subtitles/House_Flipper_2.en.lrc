[ve:60.16.100]

[00:16.43]Hello, hello.
[00:17.45]How are you?
[00:20.33]I got this coffee mug, this new coffee mug.
[00:24.07]And it keeps the coffee hot.
[00:26.87]In the mug.
[00:29.82]So it lasts like a couple hours sometimes.
[00:32.38]So you can, to the last sip.
[00:38.42]Sometimes I forget about coffee.
[00:40.30]I'll make a coffee and just forget it exists.
[00:43.50]And I'll go back to it like 30-40 minutes later and I'm like, what the hell?
[00:48.62]This isn't hot coffee.
[00:53.76]But, no, this is a cool invention.
[00:57.91]You forgot coffee exists.
[01:01.33]Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.
[01:06.47]Bro, not retired.
[01:10.63]Well, this is an exception.
[01:14.15]House Slipper 2 is out.
[01:18.31]Guys, do you really need me to tell you why I'm here?
[01:21.51]There's three very important reasons why I'm here.
[01:23.61]Number one, House Slipper is, I think, my most streamed video game on stream.
[01:32.21]I think it is.
[01:32.95]I think it's like number one or number two.
[01:34.43]So, I've been anticipating House Slipper 2...
[01:43.35]Just maybe like 10% under me being excited for the Elden Ring DLC.
[01:52.28]I wish that... I wish that they were both out right now.
[01:58.43]But I have no idea.
[01:59.55]Who knows when Elden Ring's gonna come out.
[02:03.87]And this is sponsored.
[02:09.13]Can you believe that?
[02:11.48]This is going to be an entire weekend of sponsored playing House Flipper 2.
[02:17.50]That's fucking awesome.
[02:22.87]So we're just going to chill.
[02:23.55]We're going to play it.
[02:24.99]The House Flipper devs are awesome.
[02:28.39]I'm just playing the game.
[02:29.41]So thank you to House Flipper for the sponsor for the whole goddamn weekend.
[02:47.56]Wait, what did you say?
[02:54.02]Did they forgive you for being late?
[02:58.23]I hope so.
[03:02.03]Oh, but last night was so much fun.
[03:04.91]I'm still kind of recovering, if I'm honest.
[03:06.79]I woke up this morning.
[03:08.73]As part of the sponsor, they wanted me to be live earlier in the day.
[03:13.89]So I was like, that's fine.
[03:14.49]Yeah, that's cool.
[03:15.43]So I got up this morning and my like chest and stomach were just so painful.
[03:20.77]Like, oh, it's like the Tin Man getting up.
[03:29.84]It was so funny.
[03:30.70]It was so fun.
[03:32.24]I keep having flashes of just the things that I thought were great.
[03:36.13]So it was really, really cool.
[03:41.10]I missed last stream.
[03:42.26]What did you do?
[03:44.08]You have a, a, do you have a doozy?
[03:50.14]You have like 18 different streams to go potentially watch if you really wanted to.
[03:56.04]I love that event.
[03:57.28]I love the kind of house slipper invitational type stuff.
[04:00.78]Because if you wanted to, if you just watched my stream,
[04:06.54]that's alright that's cool you can see like the finished builds and you know all the the grading and um some of the back and forth and all that but you could see everybody build their houses whoever was live right I don't think every single person was live but but uh but yeah it's um you get this probably like a hundred plus hours of content if you wanted to have it
[04:33.31]It's in the morning.
[04:34.50]Hey, it's 10 o'clock in the morning.
[04:37.36]My voice is a milk voice until like 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[04:46.56]But it is so much.
[04:52.74]The left side of my stomach is tight today.
[04:57.99]Fuck.
[04:59.21]Without further ado.
[05:00.83]Thank you House Flipper for the sponsor.
[05:02.15]This is going to be fun.
[05:03.03]I'm very interested.
[05:03.89]I want to play.
[05:04.55]I want to like start the game normally.
[05:07.30]We had kind of a wild evening last night.
[05:09.98]It was wild.
[05:11.86]I'd like to tone it down a little and just play the game.
[05:15.28]Because there's a whole story mode.
[05:16.84]There's a whole game here and I want to see it.
[05:18.54]So we're going to start.
[05:20.06]Don't like this.
[05:26.52]Give me one second.
[05:27.42]I want to grab something real quick.
[06:38.84]Where did he go?
[06:39.48]I had to grab these headphones because they were kind of tangled up.
[06:46.26]Alright.
[06:47.02]You guys ready?
[06:50.51]There is something that I want to mention.
[06:53.23]This is really, really interesting.
[06:54.97]I did not know that they were doing it like this.
[06:57.43]But they're doing a community contest.
[07:00.99]Look at this.
[07:02.39]This is very, very interesting.
[07:03.71]Watch this.
[07:07.73]So...
[07:09.55]Until January 31st, they are doing, I think, a build contest.
[07:17.48]I want you to see what you can win.
[07:19.32]That's very important.
[07:22.42]Do you have pants on?
[07:23.22]Uh, probably.
[07:25.85]Probably.
[07:30.36]No cam right now.
[07:31.18]No cam.
[07:32.06]I'm fucking tired.
[07:33.98]And I'm ready to chill with House Slipper 2.
[07:37.62]But yeah, look at this.
[07:38.82]So for the next about, I want to say like 30, 40 days, 45 days.
[07:42.72]How much time is left in December?
[07:44.95]They're doing a contest and look at what the grand prize is.
[07:49.57]This is a computer.
[07:53.70]Win a one-of-a-kind computer set created by AMD in collaboration with crafts of two.
[07:59.99]Look at how fucking ridiculous this is.
[08:04.31]I want this.
[08:09.70]What's in it?
[08:12.52]Yeah, it's crazy.
[08:14.68]I knew that they were doing some type of computer thing, but I did not know they were doing that.
[08:23.61]You need to enter the contest.
[08:24.71]Yeah, so the contest details.
[08:27.05]So that's what's in it.
[08:30.82]What do I even have?
[08:36.10]I have a... I have an AMD, right?
[08:38.24]I have AMD 67-something?
[08:40.00]7800X3D?
[08:40.12]What the fuck does that mean?
[08:42.32]You have a 3090?
[08:42.60]Yeah, that thing's gonna last until...
[08:53.60]Five years from now.
[08:54.52]I'm not going to... Guys, I'm not going to have to buy another graphics card until I'm like 60.
[08:58.04]I'm fine.
[09:00.44]Buying a 3090 was investing in a car.
[09:03.04]I'm going to have that thing for 10 years.
[09:09.04]But so... What are you going to do?
[09:13.12]You buy the game on Steam.
[09:15.00]And I can't click this for you.
[09:17.54]But you get... Remember what we were doing with the sharing files last night?
[09:23.26]You can do that.
[09:24.10]You get the project file.
[09:27.68]Follow the instructions.
[09:32.02]Tag your project.
[09:34.46]Yeah, they did the whole integration with mod.io.
[09:37.02]We didn't use that last night just because we were kind of working with a lot of people that it just was easier to get them to dump it directly into the Discord.
[09:46.78]But I think they have a collaboration with mod.io.
[09:51.54]That's cool.
[09:55.00]Yeah, this is houseflipper2.com slash contest.
[09:59.58]And you can get there from either the link in the chat that pops up from the timer or the chat bot.
[10:05.38]Or just go click on the goddamn panel.
[10:07.44]You'll find it.
[10:10.74]They got 47 days, 37 minutes, 13 hours.
[10:13.68]Oh my God, there's 2300 entries already.
[10:18.95]Oh shit, I have cookies disabled.
[10:23.52]There's over 2,000 entries already?
[10:25.84]Oh, God.
[10:28.82]I've got to make something good.
[10:31.57]But yeah, I mean, that's cool.
[10:32.63]They're giving away a really interesting custom PC with a really wild custom case.
[10:41.25]Well, that's really cool.
[10:43.80]And that's all they wanted me to show.
[10:46.16]So...
[10:47.08]Now we're just going to play.
[10:48.66]Thanks again, HouseLipper.
[10:50.20]If you want to join the contest, please do.
[10:52.86]Maybe have a chance to win this computer.
[10:55.06]Among other things, I think.
[10:57.84]Let's see.
[11:00.68]Is that the grand prize?
[11:01.72]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:04.65]Here we go.
[11:05.35]It's not just the computer.
[11:12.69]I have one of these.
[11:15.25]I have one of these.
[11:17.28]Maybe I'll show it.
[11:17.78]Alright, that's really cool.
[11:20.89]Thanks again, House Flipper, for sponsoring Let's Play the Game.
[11:23.23]I am excited.
[11:24.03]I'm ready to go.
[11:24.85]Let's do it.
[11:25.51]New game.
[11:26.09]Here we go.
[11:29.31]Yeah, I just tested it last night, so that's fine.
[11:32.91]How's the airflow?
[11:33.93]That's a good question.
[11:34.71]I mean, it looks awesome.
[11:40.59]That thing's a display.
[11:45.40]I'll turn that off.
[11:52.92]Euro-friendly hype.
[11:56.86]Yeah, I've got that contractually obligated EU hype.
[12:04.09]Okay, cool.
[12:05.11]I got... That scared the shit out of me.
[12:09.09]...to find a job like that.
[12:22.03]This dialogue options.
[12:23.25]OK, how is there?
[12:25.83]I can't hear you.
[12:27.17]Are you in mute anyway?
[12:31.56]I'm afraid I don't have good news for you the town council puts a renovation on hold which is a he's not talking to anybody a community center was such a great idea and now all we have is the ugliest house on this side of the coast it's a long story the point is this renovation isn't happening now but don't worry I got you another job instead it's not as prestigious but does this guy not know how a phone works right check your email for the details and don't be a stranger again
[13:01.92]Okay, because I ended the call.
[13:05.13]That's so funny.
[13:05.75]Alright, the email, okay, this is emails.
[13:09.27]Because House Slipper 1, you had the computer and the computer gave you jobs and then you did the jobs and made money and you could buy new houses.
[13:16.54]Okay, if your first job is waiting, if I press tab, the emails tab.
[13:21.50]funny because I have not done any of this we only were messing around in the sandbox mode to try to get ready for the event because we only had like a day or two to prepare like we were just trying to rush to get people aware of the sandbox mode so I don't even this first time I've ever seen this emails okay so you want to be a House Flipper okay
[13:47.61]I've been tasked with selling this little house, but right now it's totally a mess.
[13:50.33]I need someone to clean it up.
[13:53.53]I'm your guy.
[13:54.83]Over the new interior designer for the first and last time, she over-decorated the house and left the windows to let the fresh air in, which wouldn't be that bad if only a raccoon didn't take it as an invitation to pay a visit.
[14:06.83]The aftermath is in the pictures.
[14:09.63]Interesting.
[14:10.05]Alright, simple job, easy money.
[14:12.13]It's going to be a tutorial.
[14:13.09]Let's see.
[14:14.61]How bad is it?
[14:25.19]I kind of feel like this is the kind of thing that somebody would do to post to Reddit.
[14:31.41]But they did it themselves.
[14:34.15]Guys, a fucking raccoon got in my house.
[14:36.36]It was fucked up.
[14:37.32]Look what it did.
[14:40.66]It has like 10,000 uploads.
[14:49.51]Okay, I got it.
[14:50.87]Let's go.
[14:57.76]You gotta get that Reddit gold.
[15:00.98]A yellow quest icon means that there are quests nearby.
[15:05.90]To see a detailed quest list, press tab.
[15:09.66]Wait, there are quests on the street.
[15:15.28]Don't know how to use your tool.
[15:16.79]Oh, from the demo, I remember this.
[15:19.81]Kind of vaguely.
[15:23.20]Look around for a book with Bessie the Beaver on the cover.
[15:25.52]Open it by pressing E to read some tooltips.
[15:27.72]Okay.
[15:29.06]So just tab, right click.
[15:30.32]Yeah, same thing as last time.
[15:31.31]Okay, key.
[15:34.15]There's a flipper sense.
[15:37.23]Alright, cool.
[15:37.85]So.
[15:39.85]Quests.
[15:41.43]There's trash and cleaning.
[15:43.61]Ah, okay.
[15:44.83]Let's go.
[15:46.93]Yeah, you have a trash bag in this one, which is interesting.
[15:52.15]You actually have to throw it in the trash, right?
[15:55.86]You do, yeah.
[15:58.02]They're making you work.
[16:02.48]Yep.
[16:09.11]I'm going to get all the trash first.
[16:12.95]And then I'll clean.
[16:14.17]That makes sense to me.
[16:18.79]Oh, I filled the bag already.
[16:19.81]Shit.
[16:20.87]Can I bring this over here?
[16:22.51]Can I just drag this over?
[16:25.21]No, I got an idea.
[16:26.51]Pick up all the trash, throw it outside.
[16:28.61]Then put it away.
[16:33.67]What was the way to interact with quests?
[16:44.18]I would not.
[16:45.22]I would not, like, do this.
[16:46.30]I would use, like, a mop.
[16:48.80]That's, uh, I love that there's, like, this progression here.
[16:50.96]I have a rag.
[16:51.68]If someone was coming to clean up, uh, my house for a job, and I was like, oh, okay, cool.
[17:00.51]So, yeah, you getting ready to get started?
[17:02.07]Like, yep.
[17:04.39]And they're just walking around going like this.
[17:06.17]It'd be like, oh, shit, you don't have, we have a mop?
[17:15.78]Bucket in a mop.
[17:16.60]Yeah.
[17:17.90]But this is not a bucket in a mop.
[17:19.01]This is a rag.
[17:24.13]Oh, watch out.
[17:24.57]That raccoon really, like, fucked up this kitchen.
[17:30.98]A rag and some spit.
[17:32.32]Yeah, that's what it feels like.
[17:35.00]Hey, we're starting somewhere, though.
[17:40.24]Oh, does it?
[17:43.02]It contextually changes based on what surface you're on.
[17:47.47]Ah, okay, that's cool.
[17:52.81]W, what is it?
[17:56.47]There's no game audio?
[17:58.18]Oh, shit, let me turn it up.
[17:59.32]Because of last night, it was turned down.
[18:02.82]So people could be in the call talking.
[18:06.18]Thank you.
[18:12.17]It was dialed down from last night.
[18:14.29]That's better.
[18:25.29]Why up so early?
[18:26.00]Because House Slipper 2 is out and I'm sponsored to play it and I want to play it because I love this fucking franchise.
[18:39.94]Oh, I also see the people in the chat room right now trying to get me to say something on stream.
[18:46.95]During a sponsored segment, by the way.
[18:49.53]How dare you?
[19:02.00]Honestly, if the devs watched the stream last night, that is incredibly fucking tame in comparison to what I would be saying if I said that.
[19:15.02]No, they don't give a shit.
[19:16.04]They don't care.
[19:16.66]They're fucking cool.
[19:17.18]Alright.
[19:21.78]So what?
[19:22.70]I need dirt.
[19:23.82]Wait, I'm going.
[19:24.40]I'm getting ahead of myself.
[19:25.36]Trash.
[19:28.94]Any more trash?
[19:29.90]Yep.
[19:30.38]Lots of it.
[19:48.52]There's a little grill in here.
[19:50.75]You're going to play Elden Ring DLC on stream?
[19:54.97]Yeah, I mean, that is an automatic yes.
[19:58.93]It's so funny, I believe every single streamer, their streams are all going to turn on at the same time when Elden Ring DLC is out.
[20:07.64]It actually might break Twitch's platform.
[20:18.34]Like, that's the kind of shit where the DLC launches and it's like, oh, look, here we go.
[20:23.41]Press go live.
[20:24.59]And everybody's like, we fry a server.
[20:27.27]There's gonna be like 600 million people streaming that game and playing that game at the same time.
[20:36.34]This is knocked over.
[20:49.03]Everybody's playing House Flipper last night too.
[20:50.89]Yeah.
[20:52.05]You love to see that too.
[20:54.91]What was the total?
[20:55.88]There was like 100,000 concurrent viewers last night across all the channels.
[20:59.42]You love to see it.
[21:03.08]That makes me so happy.
[21:05.74]How many years has gone by of me telling people to play this fucking game?
[21:10.16]Play it.
[21:10.68]Play this game.
[21:11.44]Play it for the love of God.
[21:12.58]I've said it for like eight years.
[21:16.39]And here we are.
[21:16.95]House Flipper 2.
[21:18.03]And it's awesome.
[21:20.59]You're a nerd.
[21:24.71]So are you.
[21:28.64]Oh, okay, I finished that.
[21:32.94]And that means your client is happy with your work.
[21:35.20]You can finish the job now and get paid, but note that you have one star out of three.
[21:38.86]That's not good.
[21:39.38]No, I want... I'm a two star at least.
[21:46.30]Alright, trash.
[21:53.84]Uh, this TV is kind of fucked up.
[21:55.80]Move it out of the way for a second.
[22:06.21]Imagine the raccoon just jumped out and started fucking biting my face right now.
[22:11.54]Just like...
[22:28.15]This stuff's not trash.
[22:35.07]Hmm.
[22:37.91]Should I put up the TV back up?
[22:38.97]I mean, yeah.
[22:44.60]Oh.
[22:52.11]Just take my arm, place it against the back right of this wall, cup with my hand, and pull to the left and drag everything down into the bag.
[23:04.10]And do that to every shelf.
[23:14.97]Can I put this back up?
[23:15.73]Where was this?
[23:16.83]Where's this supposed to be?
[23:21.29]This person loves fish by the way.
[23:25.44]This is a very this is a fish house.
[23:29.54]This is a they got a theme here.
[23:31.12]Just wanna fuck with him real quick.
[23:38.38]They'll never find that.
[23:39.64]Looks like I'm like a year.
[23:50.14]These are clean.
[23:54.43]Hold on, that was... Let me turn... Should I turn the sound down a little?
[23:57.92]That seemed a little bit... A little bit loud.
[23:59.34]Yeah, that's better.
[24:08.16]Hey, was that Discord post you were going to make an elaborate prank?
[24:11.83]No.
[24:12.09]I just... It's written.
[24:14.07]It's... I haven't posted it.
[24:16.91]And I know.
[24:17.59]I'm bad.
[24:18.51]I'm awful.
[24:19.29]I know.
[24:19.67]I'm trying.
[24:20.39]I need to communicate better.
[24:21.63]And that's my fault.
[24:24.23]But in my defense, I feel like I've talked about it so much that it's okay if it takes another few days or another whatever week, whatever, or a month or a year.
[24:41.90]Just how far can I throw?
[24:48.79]I hope somebody in the neighborhood was looking out the window.
[24:51.55]That would be fucking awesome to see that.
[24:53.76]Can you imagine seeing that out your front window?
[24:56.66]You're like, what is the neighbor doing with the trash bag?
[24:58.58]And he just like throws it across his whole yard, gets it in and like jumps and screams.
[25:03.62]Alright, do you open up your window?
[25:05.82]Like, if I'm over, if I'm in this house, do you pull the window up and go, nice!
[25:13.51]What does that mean?
[25:14.17]Like, what are you, why are you looking at me?
[25:15.69]Why are you, why are you looking at me through your window?
[25:18.23]I don't know, what, right?
[25:22.07]Like, hey, excuse me, why the fuck are you looking at me?
[25:24.85]I don't know.
[25:35.16]Alright, I'm pretty much done.
[25:36.86]There's stuff in here, though.
[25:39.43]Where?
[25:46.51]Am I on their computer?
[25:47.63]I should not be on their computer.
[25:51.08]What am I selling?
[25:58.90]Use?
[25:59.74]What is all this?
[26:02.98]Oh, this is okay.
[26:04.36]This is saying don't... I have two stars right now.
[26:10.01]So if I sell this stuff, I get more.
[26:13.93]This is part of the quest.
[26:17.25]Hold on.
[26:17.51]Let me see if that works.
[26:18.81]Which fish was it?
[26:20.37]This one here?
[26:27.82]This one, right?
[26:32.48]Is that correct?
[26:34.00]Oops.
[26:40.66]Well, I saw the wrong one.
[26:51.61]Shit.
[26:54.11]These are like important family heirlooms or something, and I'm just selling them.
[26:59.50]Sell them all.
[27:01.69]Sell.
[27:02.09]I see four.
[27:05.62]Oh, shit.
[27:06.20]Okay, here we go.
[27:06.84]This one dirty window, this 50... Okay, that's cool.
[27:12.68]Cool.
[27:12.84]I gotta get it.
[27:13.84]It wants me to sell the live, laugh, love sign, which... I agree.
[27:18.73]That thing's gotta go.
[27:21.81]Where is it?
[27:27.51]Uh, I sell that, right?
[27:29.14]Ah, that's one of the secret ones.
[27:32.74]Oh, it's just, it's stuff in this room that I need to sell.
[27:36.20]Oh shit.
[27:36.76]Okay.
[27:37.14]Hold on.
[27:38.79]Yep.
[27:39.27]Okay.
[27:42.29]So just the picture and then that, that, and then there's a painting.
[27:49.39]Okay.
[27:49.67]There you go.
[27:50.77]Nice.
[27:50.97]Alright.
[27:54.23]There's a lot of stuff to sell in here.
[27:58.38]Not everything though.
[28:02.16]Alright, where's the live, laugh, love sign?
[28:04.70]Okay, get rid of that.
[28:10.57]This is a vase or something, right?
[28:15.83]This is all done?
[28:16.39]I get weird when I play this game because I have to do everything.
[28:29.30]It's like Luigi's Mansion.
[28:32.68]I can't help it.
[28:33.58]Everything must be completed.
[28:34.62]Where are the two paintings?
[28:38.48]Oh, there's stuff up here.
[28:41.26]That was it.
[28:42.02]Okay, that was it.
[28:42.70]I need a fish.
[28:44.02]Two paintings.
[28:46.45]Vase.
[28:47.75]Steering wheel.
[28:48.43]Fish.
[28:49.39]Bureau.
[28:55.89]Oh, this is a tutorial.
[28:59.55]As the game progresses, you'll get a chance to unlock cleaning spray.
[29:02.96]Use R to make the stains go away faster.
[29:05.64]Okay.
[29:09.44]R. I think that's everything in here.
[29:14.74]No, where's the wheel?
[29:16.97]There it is.
[29:20.37]Everything's done here.
[29:21.39]Everything's done here.
[29:21.99]Wait, there's some stains.
[29:29.64]There's a stain in here too.
[29:33.48]God damn it.
[29:34.64]There it is.
[29:37.83]When does the gugga to start?
[29:40.81]Uh, you can put it on right now if you want.
[29:42.71]There's a lot of shit going on here.
[29:44.07]Let's go.
[29:50.84]Trash.
[29:54.78]Trash done.
[29:55.38]Trash done.
[30:00.49]Oops.
[30:03.77]I can't get... Come on.
[30:04.53]I don't want to run all the way out there.
[30:07.60]Fine.
[30:07.98]I'll go out there.
[30:08.98]Fine.
[30:12.34]You're so early.
[30:13.26]Yeah.
[30:15.34]This is a coffee stream.
[30:18.52]I probably should read this one, too.
[30:19.50]Mm-hmm.
[30:24.11]Mm-hmm.
[30:26.93]Uh-huh.
[30:29.77]Uh-huh.
[30:34.36]Okay, if there's none, that's a good thing to see, because if there's not a trash barrel, then I have to buy one.
[30:38.43]Okay.
[30:52.69]Shit, there's still trash.
[30:53.74]What's out here?
[30:54.20]Alright, I got all the trash.
[30:55.94]I gotta get three stars on the first mission.
[31:01.08]Stains.
[31:01.52]Stains.
[31:05.48]Where are they?
[31:08.54]There.
[31:11.76]This is the open window.
[31:12.72]Do I have to close this?
[31:20.58]Thank you for closing our window.
[31:21.84]We had no idea how to do it.
[31:22.98]Alright, still a couple things to sell.
[31:30.60]Why is it 864p?
[31:32.00]Yeah, I need to go to 1080.
[31:34.50]I definitely, with the NVIDIA NVENC stuff, I can definitely do it with a 3090.
[31:38.46]Okay, where, what's wrong?
[31:45.18]There's one window in here that's all fucked up.
[31:46.86]Oh, there it is.
[31:47.28]Nice.
[31:55.51]Done.
[32:02.02]Alright, I think I almost have it 100%.
[32:03.28]It's going to be behind the couch or something, right?
[32:08.69]Aha!
[32:15.79]Is that it?
[32:21.11]Okay, lamp, vase, and... Oh, I think I know what that is.
[32:25.76]Yeah, that's over here.
[32:30.42]That's like a... This one and this one.
[32:32.48]I think that's it.
[32:33.90]Three stars, 100%.
[32:34.72]We got it.
[32:35.20]No, it's two stars.
[32:35.96]Why?
[32:36.18]It's three stars, right?
[32:43.68]Am I missing anything?
[32:44.35]Is there apparently a stain in here?
[32:49.01]No, it's alright.
[32:53.41]I just dropped it.
[32:55.65]You will earn 2,000 coins.
[32:58.61]Eh, it's just the tutorial.
[32:59.39]It's fine.
[33:00.71]It's the door.
[33:01.79]Wait, the door?
[33:06.60]This door?
[33:12.18]Oh, shit!
[33:12.64]There it is.
[33:13.10]Thank you.
[33:15.94]Okay, cool.
[33:16.78]Yes, there we go.
[33:17.59]Alright, we're done.
[33:18.31]I did everything.
[33:19.19]100%.
[33:20.29]Sweet.
[33:20.41]Sweet.
[33:36.09]Very cool.
[33:36.87]So now what can I do with the money?
[33:39.81]There's so many upgrades.
[33:40.83]There's so much progression.
[33:42.09]That's such a drip feed.
[33:45.87]Alright, so now I can do... Emails?
[33:53.04]Okay, another email.
[33:55.86]Hello again.
[33:56.30]Thanks for your help last time.
[33:57.66]Since you did so well, I've another job for you.
[33:59.38]I helped my friend buy her new home and it seems she needs more... She's unpacking.
[34:04.76]Help unpacking her stuff.
[34:07.73]Okay, easy.
[34:12.00]To be honest, I wish I could hire someone to do the unpacking for me.
[34:14.72]Actually, it's not a bad idea.
[34:15.86]Maybe you know someone.
[34:16.82]I'll do it.
[34:26.40]Oh, look at this little house.
[34:27.26]Alright, so you need help unpacking.
[34:40.19]That was really mean.
[34:47.37]Quests.
[34:48.67]Lost on what to do?
[34:49.60]No fear of flipper senses here.
[34:51.24]Rooms with bright yellow quest markers have a quest waiting for you.
[34:58.80]Okay.
[34:59.82]That's helpful.
[35:03.34]My chair just got electrocuted.
[35:05.39]Me-
[35:14.71]And a cleaning person, I see.
[35:16.37]Oh, yeah.
[35:17.87]Sorry about that.
[35:18.95]I didn't expect Tom to act so fast and I left everything as usual.
[35:23.51]I like to call it an artistic chaos.
[35:27.07]Artistic chaos.
[35:28.25]Maybe I'll just let you do your thing.
[35:30.11]And thanks again for your help.
[35:32.03]Bye.
[35:32.27]That's kind of funny.
[35:35.32]I kind of get that.
[35:36.54]I get that.
[35:40.29]My room looks way, way, way worse than this when I'm in the middle of a big project.
[35:49.51]For a month.
[36:02.49]Food.
[36:04.39]You got a collecting trash perk point.
[36:07.80]You gained enough experience collecting trash to get your first perk point.
[36:10.60]To use it, press tab.
[36:11.36]Go to the perks tab.
[36:12.24]Don't be afraid to experiment.
[36:13.12]You can always press reset and assign your points differently.
[36:15.50]Oh, yeah.
[36:18.32]Let's go.
[36:18.68]Oh.
[36:20.56]Oh, wait.
[36:21.26]Alright.
[36:23.85]Keep collecting trash.
[36:25.85]The bigger, the better.
[36:26.67]Trash bags can now fit so much trash.
[36:28.85]No need for all that running.
[36:31.23]They hold more.
[36:33.69]Nice.
[36:34.01]Let's do it.
[36:35.13]Got it.
[36:49.69]Oh my goodness.
[36:52.05]This trash bag's in here.
[36:57.99]There's one thing that I will not do.
[37:02.61]And that is having a bag of trash that's full that has to go into the bin.
[37:09.86]It has to.
[37:10.70]And it's got to get out of the house.
[37:11.58]Like, it has to.
[37:13.72]You ever sit around and you have a full trash bag?
[37:16.76]You have a full trash.
[37:18.10]You're sitting kind of in the room that has the trash can in it.
[37:21.84]And you just like, did I shit my pants or did I puke somewhere?
[37:26.98]Because like what was going on?
[37:28.14]Why does it smell weird here?
[37:31.50]It's something like it did.
[37:32.92]Why does it smell like shitty in the house?
[37:36.96]And you go, no, it's a trash.
[37:38.18]Okay, take that out.
[37:39.69]I could never have a bag here.
[37:48.32]Oh, there's one in here too.
[37:49.86]Okay.
[37:50.98]Wait.
[37:53.14]That was empty.
[37:57.86]That was right there.
[38:00.70]Okay.
[38:08.02]And we got more in here.
[38:09.06]Good.
[38:24.72]Alright, what about in here?
[38:26.58]I need quests.
[38:28.32]There's still a bunch of trash.
[38:29.36]Unpack boxes.
[38:32.90]Oh.
[38:41.55]Take item out.
[38:43.19]What is this?
[38:43.71]Oh, it's a cube.
[38:44.51]Here you go.
[38:45.91]That's the most logical place, right?
[38:47.03]I have to decorate too?
[38:56.37]I'm so good at this.
[38:57.25]Nice.
[39:10.57]What should be the book?
[39:11.11]The books are going to be up here.
[39:20.11]You didn't have very much stuff in there.
[39:29.09]What is this?
[39:29.57]I don't know.
[39:38.76]This would drive me insane if this was right here on the bed, on the headboard.
[39:43.72]All you would hear would just be, oh, it'd be in your nightmares.
[39:47.42]It'd be in your dreams.
[39:48.42]I cannot have an analog clock in my house.
[39:52.86]Forget about the joke and the meme about me not being able to read it when I was high that time.
[39:57.60]But seriously, this sound.
[40:01.95]I hear it everywhere.
[40:03.99]I could be across the entire room.
[40:06.17]I could be in a different room entirely.
[40:07.87]I'll still hear it.
[40:12.95]I know some people, that's like nice and rhythmic, therapeutic.
[40:17.55]Some people like that sound.
[40:19.17]Oh, get that off.
[40:20.00]Get it away from me.
[40:30.14]Captain Hook Andy.
[40:31.30]Don't make me laugh hard anymore.
[40:45.61]I laughed so hard last night.
[40:47.77]I'm in pain.
[40:48.61]This is a bad placement on this boogie.
[40:58.65]That's that's such a funny, specific fucking reference like.
[41:02.27]Oh.
[41:09.87]Do you still have the pirate shirt on?
[41:11.68]No, that thing was wet, by the way, when I took it off.
[41:17.04]I don't want to be gross to anybody, but that was disgusting.
[41:28.37]I like these missions.
[41:29.59]Little unpack quests.
[41:30.71]They're fun.
[41:33.98]Ew, bro, ew.
[41:45.81]I guess I could put this away nicely, but... I mean, I... No.
[41:58.05]Dude was marinated.
[41:59.09]Oh yeah, time to eat dinner.
[42:10.24]Let me sit down at my nice breakfast nook.
[42:13.98]Oh, there's a fucking microwave right in front of me.
[42:19.82]Perfect to reheat it when it gets cold.
[42:21.42]Oh, there's more?
[42:35.92]That microwave placement is ass.
[42:39.86]Look, I was hired to come clean the house.
[42:43.70]No.
[42:44.34]No, I wasn't.
[42:44.78]That was the last job.
[42:45.66]I'm sorry.
[42:46.04]I'm doing this wrong.
[42:48.30]I got the two jobs melded together.
[42:51.18]I'm here to unpack, not to clean.
[42:54.31]And I'm cleaning, not unpacking correctly.
[42:58.27]There was a communication breakdown somewhere in those emails.
[43:05.85]I'll fix it.
[43:06.73]I'll fix it.
[43:07.37]I'll fix it.
[43:08.01]I'll fix it.
[43:08.67]Hold on.
[43:09.05]I need to stop.
[43:39.96]Hey.
[43:42.10]You hear something?
[43:55.57]I'm sorry, but I can't work under these conditions.
[44:04.84]Actually, like kind of hear me out on this one.
[44:07.38]Just listen, hear me out on this.
[44:11.61]Is this really that bad of a place to put this?
[44:14.51]In reality?
[44:15.15]I kind of feel like if I get home, there's a bunch of ships going on all day, and it's like, oh, fuck.
[44:24.38]Oh, shit, it's 8 o'clock.
[44:25.28]Alright, I'm good.
[44:25.94]I'm good.
[44:26.36]I'm good.
[44:26.62]Alright, what's going on at 8 o'clock?
[44:29.56]Alright, I know immediately.
[44:30.78]I'm not going to take my phone out.
[44:32.26]And you know what?
[44:32.92]Fucking digital bullshit.
[44:35.18]No, let's go back to the fucking physical analog media.
[44:40.35]Put this outside.
[44:41.85]You're a crackhead.
[44:45.81]Dude, you know what would be awesome?
[44:47.27]If somebody made a clock house yesterday.
[44:55.12]That's okay.
[44:56.98]There's a potential to use the fishing rod tool and make a clock house.
[45:03.36]Where all the walls are just different size clocks and shit.
[45:11.14]Alright, so I gotta, let me rearrange.
[45:13.29]That's where the microwave goes.
[45:15.05]I know.
[45:15.59]Okay.
[45:16.81]Okay.
[45:18.45]Okay.
[45:18.97]What are these?
[45:19.35]Different fucking like spell ingredients.
[45:22.41]I think it's kind of funny that cooking is essentially like making a spell.
[45:29.43]Like a witch in a brew.
[45:34.07]Oh, two, two crab's legs.
[45:36.28]One pinch of turmeric and three leaves of bay.
[45:42.45]We're witches.
[45:44.46]We are witches.
[45:46.02]All of us.
[45:46.38]What happened here?
[46:02.87]Nice backyard.
[46:06.87]He's accusing us of witchcraft.
[46:08.38]Yeah.
[46:13.98]Okay, what would you call it?
[46:16.85]You're boiling, bubbling, toiling, and troubling with a bunch of ingredients in a boiling pot of water.
[46:26.31]What would you call that?
[46:28.93]Sir or madam?
[46:37.53]It's not magic?
[46:43.36]Burn him at the stake.
[46:48.16]Burn him!
[46:49.12]Burn him!
[46:49.64]He's a witch!
[46:50.76]He's a witch!
[46:51.64]But my goodness, the stew he made was fantastic.
[46:57.73]I haven't tasted carrots like this in ages, but did you see how he made it?
[47:01.09]He added a boiling pot with a cauldron.
[47:02.91]What am I doing?
[47:11.33]Did I clean everything?
[47:12.53]Alright, everything's good out here.
[47:20.88]Oh my god.
[47:21.64]Oh, they're outside.
[47:23.16]Okay, that's still too close.
[47:34.37]Excuse me.
[47:34.89]Yeah, you did a great job with everything, but... Why...
[47:39.39]Why were the clocks under the deck?
[47:51.98]Put them on the neighbor's house?
[47:54.38]Uh, hold on.
[48:01.39]Where did I put this one over here?
[48:05.09]Can I put it on the neighbor's house?
[48:08.94]Oh, no, no, no.
[48:10.00]I think because I'm in the quest mode, I can't go anywhere else.
[48:13.36]Are we on the tree?
[48:17.37]On the barrel?
[48:17.93]I don't know where I should put it.
[48:23.73]Ah, whatever.
[48:24.03]It doesn't matter.
[48:32.99]Put it in the barrel?
[48:35.99]I don't think I can pick it up as if it's trash.
[48:37.43]Let's see.
[48:46.39]No, I can't.
[48:49.38]I'm spending way too much time trying to throw away a clock.
[48:53.34]Let me finish this quest.
[49:15.33]Oh, look at the things that hold books.
[49:24.25]Everything good in here?
[49:26.11]I think so.
[49:28.55]Everything good in here?
[49:29.39]Yep.
[49:31.53]Bathroom needs a little bit of work.
[49:33.13]Yeah.
[49:35.18]Kind of a mess, but that's not my problem.
[49:43.30]I was going to have an extra.
[49:46.34]Always.
[49:53.75]Be honest.
[49:55.29]I want everyone to be honest.
[49:57.05]Do not lie to me.
[49:59.77]How many times have you guys realized that there was only like one or... Okay, let's go over this really quickly.
[50:07.55]There's a thing that we all do, and I say we all, but I'm going to project on all of you, where you go into the bathroom, and you are like, okay, I'm going in here to do my business, right?
[50:18.28]You see how much toilet paper is left on the roll, and you do internal, like, 6 million IQ math of, there's not very much left on that roll, but I'm trying to calculate that I can, I think I can get the job done.
[50:36.18]And you sit there internalizing like, wait, I don't know, but there's enough, but there's not enough.
[50:42.15]And you go through with it and you get halfway through and you go this.
[50:47.54]I didn't fucking calculate this right.
[50:51.60]Whoops.
[50:59.72]You'd love a bidet.
[51:00.67]I keep hearing that.
[51:01.65]And I know, look, I know this is like the invention of the telephone, right?
[51:07.25]Why would I do that?
[51:08.23]Well, I can just talk to Gary in person.
[51:10.53]I would never call in Gary.
[51:13.36]What does that mean?
[51:14.14]I can talk to Gary.
[51:14.98]I have a voice to talk to Gary.
[51:16.38]Why would I call him?
[51:18.60]But here, my thoughts about a bidet is I feel like I would be like, well, what?
[51:26.53]It would just spray all over me, and I'd be, like, fucking wet and shit.
[51:29.21]It would have to be awful, wouldn't it?
[51:38.68]Use paper towel.
[51:39.26]Use paper after.
[51:41.26]I get it.
[51:41.64]I get it.
[51:42.30]I'm clean, though.
[51:43.68]Let me be very clear.
[51:45.34]I'm very clean.
[51:52.75]Thank you, House Slipper 2, for the sponsor.
[51:55.09]I appreciate it.
[51:56.99]Uh, it's a great game.
[51:58.41]I'm having a lot of fun.
[51:59.75]Had a great event last night.
[52:05.37]No, it's all good.
[52:06.25]This is cool.
[52:06.87]Alright, so I think I'm good.
[52:08.49]I got three stars.
[52:09.99]Let's go.
[52:10.27]2,400 coins.
[52:21.10]You should ask Ludwig about the bidet hesitancy.
[52:24.23]I feel like we've had a conversation about it, and he's just like, no, no, you don't get it.
[52:28.37]He's like, you don't get it.
[52:31.01]Is this like when you first play Dark soulslike 10 years ago, and it's just like, I just died to the first enemy.
[52:35.27]This game sucks.
[52:36.63]Is it the same thing?
[52:37.31]Like, you just don't get it.
[52:38.47]You don't get it.
[52:39.71]Just try, please.
[52:50.80]I got 5,000 bucks.
[52:51.74]What can I buy with this?
[52:53.74]Where am I, by the way?
[52:59.48]Whose house is this?
[53:00.30]Is this my house?
[53:04.61]What's happening?
[53:05.41]Wait, whose house is this?
[53:09.07]This house is fucking crazy!
[53:27.41]Okay, I love this place.
[53:30.19]But it needs a little bit of work.
[53:31.71]Should I do that?
[53:32.37]I need to... My own place is all fucked up.
[53:45.32]Let me spend a little bit of time.
[53:46.84]I mean, come on.
[53:47.68]This is a disaster.
[53:50.44]I need this painting missing.
[53:52.40]It needs to be cleaned.
[53:53.24]It needs to be repainted.
[53:54.00]Let me at least clean this room.
[53:57.69]and replace some of this stuff.
[54:09.68]I spent like two hours walking around this house before.
[54:12.34]What do you say?
[54:13.42]I spent like two hours running around this house when I realized that this was the house home.
[54:19.62]Oh, this is like the home.
[54:20.46]Yeah.
[54:22.74]Like this is where I live.
[54:23.98]That's funny.
[54:27.37]You're making the floor dirty.
[54:28.87]What?
[54:33.17]Am I?
[54:33.47]No, I'm not.
[54:35.13]Is that me?
[54:35.57]I guess it was.
[54:55.32]What's on your feet?
[54:57.27]Probably like plaster or something.
[55:09.51]American shoes inside.
[55:10.87]Not in my place.
[55:30.84]Well, hold on.
[55:31.88]I have a very specific rule.
[55:33.24]I've always had this specific rule.
[55:35.52]And that's if it's a hard surface, like a wood or tile or something, then it's okay because it's easy to clean.
[55:44.13]But carpets, absolutely not.
[55:47.92]If there are carpets anywhere in the house or in the apartment, wherever I've lived over the course of my life, right?
[55:53.82]It's always, if it's carpet, then whatever room that is, do not go in there with shoes on, ever.
[56:00.16]Carpets can get disgusting.
[56:01.78]Even if you vacuum, like, think of all the gross shit that you step in, just walking around outside.
[56:08.99]I got a perk, hold on.
[56:11.99]And walking around on a tile floor, on a wooden floor, on a linoleum floor, that's fine.
[56:16.12]You can clean that very easily.
[56:17.04]You just get a mop or a little scrub it up.
[56:18.66]It's easy.
[56:19.60]But you embed that shit into the fibers of your carpet.
[56:24.06]And they can go deep too.
[56:25.26]Especially if there's something on the bottom of your shoe.
[56:28.10]It can go deep into the fibers and then it just lives there forever.
[56:33.74]Ooh, I got a sponge.
[56:38.37]Cool.
[56:39.27]I got a spray can soon.
[56:43.27]That's much faster.
[56:44.01]Nice.
[56:47.22]No shoes on carpet.
[56:48.04]I agree.
[56:48.36]Yeah.
[56:50.20]So I'm not like too weird about it.
[56:54.38]People get it, right?
[56:55.28]It's like, oh, hey, by the way, like the carpeted rooms, just shoes off in their place.
[57:01.58]But not necessarily like a shoes at the door.
[57:06.66]I guess if if the house or the apartment was clean recently.
[57:13.36]Like, oh, I cleaned my house.
[57:14.98]I cleaned my apartment.
[57:16.10]Like, okay, then, no, please put your shoes at the door.
[57:19.16]This place was just cleaned.
[57:21.38]Like, I cleaned up.
[57:22.92]We did a bunch of work.
[57:24.48]I don't want you walking your fucking dog shit feet all over the house.
[57:28.75]Like, you stepped in dog shit.
[57:30.05]Like, leave that.
[57:30.93]Put your shoes outside, please.
[57:34.83]When was the last time any of you guys stepped in dog shit?
[57:38.57]I brought this up.
[57:39.17]I know this is like repeated material like from like five years ago.
[57:42.58]Honestly, I feel like when I was younger, I feel like even older.
[57:49.36]I feel like I have a memory of this happening all the fucking time.
[57:54.67]This doesn't happen to me that much in the last five to ten years, but I feel like it used to happen all the time.
[58:04.71]I can't tell you the last time I stepped in dog shit and went like, God, oh, come on, and had to, like, scrape my foot against the ground and.
[58:20.52]Do a poll.
[58:22.02]Yeah, any mods here?
[58:24.08]I can do it if they're right, because it's still it's pretty early.
[58:27.01]But yeah, let's do a poll.
[58:28.03]I'll do it.
[58:29.35]Oh.
[58:31.77]When was the last time you stepped in dog shit?
[58:47.39]Okay, within three months Six plus wait like six months within like within the last three months Within the last six months Within Two year within a year
[59:17.49]And then within two years.
[59:20.50]We'll do it within three years too.
[59:25.38]This is going to be like a three minute poll.
[59:26.64]Who cares?
[59:27.00]There.
[59:38.45]Is this glass?
[59:39.15]What is this?
[59:45.18]What's on the ground here?
[59:52.45]It looks like glass.
[59:53.07]Is it part of the floor pattern?
[59:57.80]Okay, I did the stairs.
[60:02.14]I'm good.
[60:02.52]Let's go do our next mission.
[60:07.54]Why is never not an option?
[60:11.22]Uh, that's true.
[60:12.68]If it's never, then just don't answer.
[60:15.44]Oh boy, some mess in here.
[60:16.68]Oh my god.
[60:18.71]What about cat shit?
[60:21.70]Um, I don't know how you would be stepping in cat shit.
[60:24.58]Where are you?
[60:26.04]Are you... Cats usually go to the bathroom in a litter box?
[60:29.74]Why are you stepping in the litter box?
[60:39.53]Oh my goodness.
[60:41.21]Okay.
[60:41.91]This place needs a lot of work.
[60:44.09]I think that's the point though.
[60:45.25]Alright, let me get my emails.
[60:52.59]Alright, new quest.
[60:53.32]Alright, we got a couple of things here.
[60:55.22]Which one should I do?
[60:57.90]During the years of miserable solitude, I paid little attention to the state of my chambers.
[61:02.31]This is going to change since a brave soul has recently joined me in all my adventures.
[61:06.95]In short, some ancient dirt and piles of trash await a truly fearless person to clear them out.
[61:13.07]Please arrive as fast as you can to help us and transform the forgotten dungeon under our living quarters.
[61:19.44]What?
[61:20.58]Making it worthy of my new companion's presence.
[61:24.46]I don't want to go here.
[61:27.08]You will be handsomely rewarded for your trouble.
[61:29.70]Just wait for us to return from a convention in which our party is participating right now.
[61:35.47]May luck be on your side.
[61:38.13]Robert Pattern.
[61:42.02]Alright, we're doing that one.
[61:44.70]Okay, we're either doing the dungeon quest or my room is a mess.
[61:50.82]I think we know what one we're doing.
[61:55.17]The state of the bedroom.
[61:55.95]I can't let him move in while it looks like that.
[61:58.65]Hahaha.
[62:00.03]The little upside down emoji.
[62:01.57]That is perfect.
[62:03.61]So could you clean it up?
[62:04.73]I don't even know where to start.
[62:07.20]Let's take a look.
[62:18.18]I thought, did he drive into the house?
[62:22.10]What happened?
[62:22.70]Oh, no, no, no.
[62:23.18]Is this the garage or is this like the fucking kitchen?
[62:28.05]Oh, okay.
[62:28.39]I think this is the garage.
[62:33.52]What about this one?
[62:41.23]OK.
[62:41.47]It's not a dungeon.
[62:42.87]It's like a game room.
[62:48.13]Burnout when exiting.
[62:50.09]Is that what it is?
[62:50.81]Hold on.
[62:51.17]Dude, that's... Okay, I want to laugh really hard right now.
[62:55.06]But I'm holding it in.
[62:56.14]Because the left side of my stomach is killing me from yesterday.
[62:59.56]But yeah, that is... That might not be going in.
[63:01.92]That is probably going out.
[63:08.60]How... Okay, how much in a rush do you have to be in?
[63:13.99]Because...
[63:15.49]Pulling out of your garage is not a majority of your trip.
[63:22.53]It's like maybe eight total seconds.
[63:25.12]You're not going to save time by peeling out of your garage.
[63:32.36]But we're going to go here.
[63:34.30]We'll do the dungeon one.
[63:37.23]Alright.
[63:37.61]So most of the, what was it?
[63:38.93]Three years?
[63:40.47]Within three years?
[63:42.98]Thousand of you said majority were within three years.
[63:46.37]Okay.
[63:47.89]So I'm not crazy.
[63:52.17]Frame perfect garage exit speedrun strat.
[63:54.85]Yeah.
[64:01.83]This place is fine.
[64:06.85]This looks pretty good so far.
[64:11.64]What was the problem?
[64:14.65]This looks fine.
[64:15.31]Alright.
[64:19.09]Well, he tried to clean that up, but took one swipe with a rag and then said, nah, never mind.
[64:33.28]What is that?
[64:34.72]Alright.
[64:39.18]But the state of the bedroom.
[64:42.42]And then he wrote dot, dot, dot.
[64:47.44]The bedroom is fine.
[64:48.48]It's the living room that's the problem.
[64:52.48]Alright, so let's clean up.
[64:57.99]Is this wine everywhere?
[64:59.03]It's some type of beverage.
[65:03.87]I'm going to say probably, yeah.
[65:16.64]M. Spinner.
[65:21.26]Wait, is that... Okay.
[65:34.31]Oh, pizza.
[65:36.95]I just keep thinking of the gamer streamer rooms from yesterday.
[65:41.38]Like pizza boxes everywhere.
[65:42.94]Disgusting mess.
[65:46.38]You never see people say, oh yeah, like gamers and streamers.
[65:49.02]Here's a gamer and streamer room.
[65:51.58]There's like math books and like clean setup and a place to wipe your feet when you come in.
[65:58.61]No, it's just pizza boxes and puke stains.
[66:14.69]I was yelling at the TV like a dad watching the Super Bowl yesterday.
[66:17.58]Hey.
[66:20.30]Sometimes, hey, when you real- Sometimes you become the dad.
[66:23.04]And you realize it.
[66:25.06]And you go, okay.
[66:26.80]Well, this is where we are now.
[66:34.21]Wait, did you say the Super Bowl?
[66:35.31]Wait.
[66:39.09]What Super Bowl?
[66:42.40]It's December.
[66:46.11]I don't follow football at all but wait wait hold on like American football or like you know football soccer but is it called that's not called the super bowl alternate timeline chatter yeah I don't know much about football but I do know the super bowl is in February
[67:19.28]Wait, they're talking about what?
[67:23.53]He said, like the Super Bowl.
[67:25.21]They were comparing your stream yesterday to the Super Bowl.
[67:33.05]Chat moves really fast.
[67:34.45]Sometimes I have to fill in the blanks.
[67:47.29]Dude, you didn't even read half of it.
[67:57.01]Oh, look at this.
[67:58.29]This is a little house.
[67:59.11]This is a home, too.
[68:06.32]Oh, you can kind of turn on a grid, too.
[68:07.72]That's cool.
[68:11.10]Go right there.
[68:13.66]Alright.
[68:13.90]What in these trash?
[68:14.49]There's still trash in here?
[68:15.53]Where?
[68:18.09]Where?
[68:18.51]Liar.
[68:18.83]I got it all.
[68:24.49]Where is it?
[68:31.05]Where's this trash that I don't see?
[68:32.11]Am I missing something here?
[68:42.56]Where is it?
[68:42.92]Behind the couch or something?
[68:52.63]No?
[68:56.27]What's your favorite Pokémon?
[68:57.65]The one that goes...
[69:17.70]I don't know where the other two pieces of trash are, but maybe you'll find it in your playthrough of House Slipper 2.
[69:26.33]Out now on Steam.
[69:36.72]Also, I will say this too.
[69:37.80]Let me say this too.
[69:38.70]I know, yeah, this is a sponsor stream, but guys, I fucking love this franchise.
[69:42.30]I've been playing this game for fucking almost 10 years.
[69:44.60]It was seven years or something.
[69:46.92]It's, I think, how much, it's right now, this is like 40 bucks.
[69:52.12]How much is it right now on Steam?
[69:59.11]It's 30, it's 35 right now.
[70:02.74]I think that's very, very reasonable.
[70:05.34]Not like 50, 60, 70.
[70:05.90]This is like, this is fucking 30 bucks.
[70:07.90]35 bucks.
[70:08.08]32 if you have House Lover 1.
[70:08.88]35 on sale.
[70:09.52]That's very reasonable.
[70:11.82]36 and 28 if you have all of House Lover 1.
[70:31.11]And this is absolutely a marketed improvement over the first game.
[70:35.09]And the proof of that was last night, obviously.
[70:39.62]Where... What am I missing here?
[70:47.48]Is there a room that I have not been in?
[70:51.26]Oh, shit.
[70:52.93]Oh, right.
[70:55.27]I forgot.
[70:55.75]This was the dungeon.
[70:56.97]It wasn't the peel-out house.
[70:59.03]Right, right, right.
[70:59.57]Okay, okay.
[71:01.53]Imagine if I ended it up there.
[71:02.83]I was like, no, I'm done.
[71:03.73]That was fun.
[71:04.95]Oh, boy.
[71:05.77]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[71:06.75]This is the mission here.
[71:21.07]That soccer ball was trash?
[71:23.47]Well, it made a sound.
[71:24.15]It made like a selling sound, so I don't know.
[71:25.67]I think this is going to be like a three or four trash bag run here.
[71:35.83]Where's my FOV at right now?
[71:36.95]Might be a little higher.
[71:47.32]Uh, like 85 maybe?
[71:48.62]Might be too much, but let's see.
[71:52.82]Better?
[71:53.06]A little bit better.
[71:56.94]90 I think feels a little too high for me in this game, but 85 I think is fine.
[72:02.65]You're on a 4K TV.
[72:05.20]Yeah, I told you.
[72:06.20]This is my new old man setup.
[72:08.63]Yeah.
[72:11.35]Is it max FOV?
[72:13.95]No, I don't want to open this yet.
[72:15.49]We got to get this situated before I start decorating.
[72:22.68]Yeah, get rid of all this crap.
[72:26.04]All this like broken boxes and this is trash.
[72:29.16]Yeah.
[72:40.96]I'm going to get this stuff out of the way.
[72:42.32]Let's put it like in the corner of here.
[72:48.16]Oh.
[72:50.04]Because I can't.
[72:51.56]I wish it was a door down here or something.
[72:54.61]Right, there is.
[72:55.01]Hold on.
[72:55.25]What's out here?
[72:56.67]Oh, shit.
[72:57.25]Okay.
[72:59.37]Oh, trash can down here.
[73:01.09]Good.
[73:03.83]Very much appreciate that.
[73:19.86]okay I think that's it is one with two more trashes one two one more
[73:46.94]Yeah, we're chilling.
[73:47.70]Oh, yeah.
[73:50.35]Oh, yeah, we are.
[73:55.73]This is a mess down here, though.
[74:00.31]Let's get rid of all this.
[74:02.07]This is technically not trash, but... I mean, it is.
[74:06.62]Can I even... Do you want to keep this, man?
[74:14.14]I don't think you do.
[74:14.90]No.
[74:15.34]No.
[74:18.77]Pretty much everything down here has to go.
[74:21.83]At least the stuff that's all fucked up, right?
[74:41.92]This thing is kind of rusty.
[74:49.92]No, that's not a good place for it.
[74:51.04]We have to put like this right here.
[74:56.74]But I wanted to come down the stairs and see that.
[75:02.64]That's the sign.
[75:03.30]This is all messed up.
[75:09.66]These don't look bad.
[75:10.48]Maybe I shouldn't sell those.
[75:18.36]Use the scanner to know what to sell.
[75:21.76]Ah, that's right.
[75:22.40]It contextually works for each tool.
[75:32.82]Pretty much most of the stuff here.
[75:40.00]What?
[75:40.14]You want me to sell this?
[75:41.18]Why?
[75:41.44]What's wrong with this?
[75:51.58]You want me to sell both of them?
[75:55.35]Okay.
[75:57.41]That's everything in this corner over here.
[76:07.29]Looking better.
[76:07.69]Okay.
[76:25.21]This is like a vault dweller room.
[76:27.60]Yeah.
[76:32.00]It's kind of huge though.
[76:33.92]Put it over here for now.
[76:35.70]Out of the way.
[76:48.72]There we go.
[76:49.74]Alright, what is this?
[76:50.62]Flipper tool.
[76:52.24]With this tool, you can first sell and then also modify items.
[76:56.22]As you progress in the game, you can unlock three extra modes apart from selling items.
[76:59.42]Duplicate, copy and paste, and change item style.
[77:04.23]Point at an item and tips.
[77:06.91]Point at an item and tips on what you can do will show up at the bottom of the screen.
[77:11.69]I see.
[77:15.24]I only have the sell mode right now.
[77:19.19]Still... Oh, I have to sell that?
[77:23.04]All the posters?
[77:23.84]Why would I get rid of all the posters?
[77:25.52]This is supposed to be a gamer room.
[77:26.88]That's why it's called House Slipper.
[77:49.91]It's very true.
[77:59.30]No, no, no, no.
[78:35.09]How many is it?
[78:35.57]I think it's five, right?
[78:45.46]Is it six?
[78:46.96]I don't think I have enough balls to do that.
[79:01.31]I'm walking on this very weirdly.
[79:08.10]Uh, okay.
[79:10.18]Almost done.
[79:13.44]Where are the balls?
[79:14.20]Okay, there's two more balls.
[79:24.71]You're a creature.
[79:25.69]Alright, here's one.
[79:34.22]You were just doing a mime on a bike.
[79:38.43]Wait a second.
[79:40.76]Hold on.
[79:42.34]I need to see that.
[79:53.37]You don't put the... Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[79:55.95]But I don't have any more.
[79:56.99]If you see another ball, you let me know.
[80:12.97]Actually, yeah, get out of the way so I can put these in the right spot.
[80:15.05]Alright, the bathroom's kind of fucked up too, right?
[80:28.06]Is it a ball?
[80:34.58]Where?
[80:34.78]Where do you see a ball?
[80:43.16]On the shelf.
[80:43.76]Okay.
[80:54.32]I see it.
[80:54.58]Yep.
[81:02.36]There we go.
[81:02.86]Cool.
[81:06.09]I'm still missing one.
[81:18.81]Bro, can I get a re-rack, please?
[81:21.87]I don't have to sell these.
[81:28.49]Let's clean them.
[81:32.47]Ooh, I did it.
[81:35.01]I'm not done, though.
[81:35.61]I want to make this look good.
[81:44.65]That is a...
[81:48.30]Alright, I don't know what this is, but it kind of looks like a missile dropped right there.
[81:56.76]That's a grenade stain.
[81:58.01]Whoa.
[82:04.71]Oh, it's because you have new posters.
[82:06.43]I get it.
[82:07.01]Alright, hold on.
[82:08.98]Let me clean this up.
[82:09.64]Okay.
[82:19.30]Alfredo sauce, yeah.
[82:34.42]Dirty ceiling.
[82:35.02]OK.
[82:46.31]Almost done with that and then we can actually move around the items.
[83:03.73]Cool.
[83:05.45]Still a little left.
[83:06.31]There we go.
[83:08.99]The walls are just dripping.
[83:13.98]Alright.
[83:15.44]Unpack the boxes.
[83:16.42]I don't want a one star review.
[83:18.50]Let's get this room to look better than it does right now.
[83:23.89]First of all.
[83:29.63]Where does this go?
[83:30.13]I'm going to move it out of the way for now.
[83:41.08]Cool.
[83:44.76]Good.
[83:48.24]Company of Champions.
[83:56.38]Turn the lights on?
[83:57.04]Oh shit.
[84:07.85]So what is this?
[84:08.39]Is this like a board game?
[84:10.83]Strong Hall.
[84:19.80]Crabble?
[84:20.66]Crababble?
[84:23.18]That's good.
[84:44.15]There's a little PSP.
[84:46.55]Cool.
[84:49.13]We got books.
[84:50.21]We know where they're going.
[84:50.92]Is this a little book?
[85:16.16]more books oh I have this placed wrong sorry you can do your own book placement it's not my job wait these are games yeah these don't you know what I'm gonna keep it like that I thought these were books
[85:43.77]Hey, isn't a video game just a digital interactive book?
[85:54.56]No.
[85:56.46]Alright.
[86:02.04]It's just a potential...
[86:05.27]Potential fictional worlds where you're reading about somebody doing something.
[86:10.75]Characters.
[86:12.73]Drama.
[86:14.09]Action.
[86:16.83]Dodge rolling.
[86:24.61]Deception, yeah.
[86:29.42]Well, you guys don't dodge around in real life when you read the part of the book.
[86:33.29]Where the main character is having a sword fight with the major villain and you're dodging around your room while you're reading it.
[86:39.67]That looks good.
[86:48.66]Clean.
[86:52.12]I like it.
[86:52.40]Alright, the bathrooms still need some work, yeah.
[86:58.50]Yeah.
[87:02.71]Put the table back?
[87:03.79]True.
[87:06.43]True.
[87:10.65]I'm just barely under three stars.
[87:12.87]What's the... What's the problem here?
[87:17.20]There's still a box to unpack.
[87:21.66]Where?
[87:24.28]Oh, shit.
[87:24.60]It's over there.
[87:30.90]What the hell is that?
[87:31.65]Toilet?
[87:36.83]Square.
[87:37.27]I yeah, I've never seen a toilet like this.
[87:45.91]Maybe once.
[87:47.57]I kind of like that though.
[87:56.13]Oh TV OK so.
[88:05.55]That makes sense, right?
[88:15.11]Let's like fucking take a bunch of hair off of everybody's eyebrows by like blowing out the speakers.
[88:21.23]Playing like fucking Skrillex through here.
[88:25.22]While people are sitting right here.
[88:37.57]Is it a PC?
[88:39.03]Is it a console or a PC?
[88:40.33]I can't tell.
[88:51.31]You know, bring the box over here.
[88:52.41]What am I doing?
[88:59.07]Nice.
[89:00.50]Sit on the couch.
[89:04.88]TV is too close to the couch.
[89:06.44]I don't, I disagree.
[89:07.26]I think that's a good view.
[89:10.26]Actually, I would say we might even want to be closer.
[89:24.04]That would hurt so bad.
[89:30.40]That's... I feel like that's way too far.
[89:32.94]You don't think that's way too far away?
[89:34.54]Put it on the TV stand.
[89:41.03]What do you mean, like, over here?
[89:50.19]Yeah, but I want, like, a little gamer nook.
[90:03.70]Yeah, this is like a 24-inch TV.
[90:10.72]You're telling me that this is a viewing angle for a TV light?
[90:14.85]I can't see what's going on.
[90:18.43]What's the table for?
[90:19.13]I think it's just a table.
[90:20.13]It's bothering me.
[90:56.64]Nice.
[91:03.93]I want this person to be able to participate, not sit against the wall.
[91:27.25]What?
[91:27.61]Why isn't everybody laughing at me?
[91:28.81]Why isn't everybody- I'm looking at you and going, what's wrong with you?
[91:30.85]What?
[91:31.07]What's wrong with you?
[91:31.69]What?
[91:32.69]Make the sofa face the wall?
[91:37.07]I can't see the TV from back here!
[91:42.35]You wanna see- What television show could you watch from back here?
[91:47.59]Your feng shui sucks.
[91:49.81]I don't wanna- I'm gonna get a neck cramp!
[91:52.53]If I- What, I can sit here?
[91:53.43]I can sit down and go like this, and turn my head to the left.
[92:01.13]No, I want to sit here to be able to see what's happening and put my feet up on this rest thing and be able to see what I'm doing.
[92:08.57]Hey, they can move it if they want.
[92:14.12]I'm making this for me, not them.
[92:21.52]You're blocking the door?
[92:22.56]Yeah, if somebody wants to squat on this, they can.
[92:29.18]You can like squat here and look.
[92:32.51]This is where I sit.
[92:38.12]Oh, nice.
[92:41.96]Ah, that's it.
[92:42.42]I'm good.
[92:51.63]Look, it doesn't matter because if anybody was sitting here... Yes, I know.
[92:55.29]Like the grand fucking Count Dracula gets to watch TV and you don't.
[92:59.69]But you're not going to be able to see anything from here.
[93:08.06]I'm good.
[93:08.58]Cool.
[93:16.62]Get a bigger TV.
[93:17.50]Well, this is just a job.
[93:18.48]That looked good.
[93:28.44]Is it before and after?
[93:29.70]That's a good question.
[93:30.62]I don't know.
[93:32.20]Maybe for certain missions or maybe not the first few missions.
[93:34.78]Maybe it's not in the game.
[93:38.11]I wonder.
[93:38.41]That's a good question.
[93:49.99]Checking the settings.
[93:50.73]Let's see.
[93:52.17]Gameplay.
[93:55.70]Mods on.
[93:57.12]Controls, key bindings, display.
[93:58.84]I think maybe it's for different missions or certain missions.
[94:08.89]I think that was in the base game, but something to keep in mind too is House Slipper 1 had... God, what?
[94:17.25]Like six expansions and like nine DLC packs or something, so... I have to unpack my own stuff.
[94:24.20]Okay, what is... Ooh, wait a minute.
[94:29.96]Can I actually build this?
[94:31.52]What?
[94:37.05]Are you serious?
[94:37.69]You can actually do this?
[94:38.59]You can build a whole huge thing?
[94:44.43]Is it weird if I want my house to just have no furniture?
[94:50.91]And the only thing that it is is a gigantic truck for that little car to go around.
[94:55.37]I don't even want a bed.
[95:20.83]I don't think this is the right piece for this.
[95:25.87]Whoa.
[95:30.42]Wait a minute.
[95:36.56]All I'm saying.
[95:37.92]All I'm saying.
[95:39.90]All I'm saying.
[95:43.00]Can you imagine if you could actually have the train work?
[95:48.73]That would be
[95:51.17]Fucking ridiculous.
[95:59.86]That's something a 40-year-old dad would say.
[96:05.43]Do you know how old I am?
[96:08.83]Wait, that was a note.
[96:09.87]Undo.
[96:10.91]Ah, shit, I missed it.
[96:16.60]That's so cute.
[96:17.48]That really is cool.
[96:19.40]I'm thinking build a giant track that goes up here and around here, down the stairs.
[96:27.09]I don't want this house to be lived in.
[96:28.87]I want it to be a giant toy.
[96:29.91]Alright, new job.
[96:35.95]Any new perks?
[96:36.43]Nope.
[96:39.18]Make Pee-Wee's Playhouse?
[96:40.54]I'm sure it'll evolve into that eventually.
[96:43.89]Alright, we can do the guy that peeled out of his garage.
[96:50.19]Or... Hi, I'm selling my house and I was told that it has to be cleaned first, even the basement.
[96:56.89]This real estate agent who was a regular in my cafe recommended your services.
[97:00.49]I probably forgot to take some stuff, so if you find any packed boxes, just leave them there.
[97:04.75]Okay.
[97:07.45]I'll pick them up at some point.
[97:08.60]Have a lovely day.
[97:13.33]It's kind of a mess, yeah.
[97:17.73]Even the basement, yeah.
[97:20.37]Let's go do the peel-out house.
[97:24.54]Ah, you can replay.
[97:25.32]That's cool.
[97:31.38]This is my house.
[97:32.96]Okay, here we go.
[97:34.24]On sale.
[97:34.87]Nothing right now.
[97:35.87]What's this?
[97:36.57]Sold.
[97:37.73]I bet I have to unlock this.
[97:44.98]Let's do the peel out job.
[97:59.80]Whoa.
[98:03.97]This is a wild house.
[98:07.23]The whole bottom floor is wait.
[98:09.75]OK, this is the front door.
[98:10.87]Whoa, that's this is interesting.
[98:16.76]The whole house is a garage.
[98:21.46]What's in here?
[98:24.16]The bathroom?
[98:25.64]What the fuck is going on here?
[98:27.32]OK, laundry, yeah.
[98:37.39]Probably shouldn't touch that.
[98:46.25]Take a look.
[98:50.55]No entry.
[98:52.87]Say my king?
[98:56.04]No entry.
[98:57.36]I can't go in there.
[98:58.04]I'm not allowed to.
[99:12.96]Interesting kitchen.
[99:13.58]Alright, let's begin.
[99:17.82]Trash.
[99:20.55]Start at the bottom.
[99:21.93]No, start at the top.
[99:23.75]Work your way down.
[99:24.33]It's clean in here.
[99:29.73]Not clean in here, though.
[99:36.29]And I'm going to complete each room at a time so I don't forget.
[99:39.05]Okay.
[99:51.26]You ever clean your room and pretend it's a House Flipper job?
[99:55.91]I thought about this, honestly, pretty recently, just because I knew this game was coming out.
[100:01.57]And, yeah, I don't know why.
[100:04.01]Hi, Steven here.
[100:08.97]The unfortunate owner of the house you've agreed to clean.
[100:12.33]So, how are you doing?
[100:14.93]You're still up for the job, right?
[100:17.27]Or did the garbage dump in my roommate's room scare you off?
[100:27.05]I'm in the house right now.
[100:29.01]I've seen worse than this.
[100:30.31]Really?
[100:31.41]Wow.
[100:32.67]I didn't think that was even possible.
[100:34.55]The world never stops to amaze me.
[100:37.15]Usually not in a good way.
[100:39.17]But to the point, I have one more request.
[100:42.61]I had a microwave, which disappeared mysteriously some time ago.
[100:47.43]If you'd find it in his room, could you move it to the kitchen?
[100:51.09]I have it since I went to college.
[100:53.63]It would be a pity to lose it now.
[101:00.91]a weird thing to want yeah how do you have a sentimental microwave should I just hang up on him why didn't you get it back I make no promises
[101:22.59]I mean, you're going to pay me more money?
[101:25.03]Let's find out because I know where it is.
[101:26.51]It's not like I have to go look for it.
[101:27.49]I'm looking at it right now.
[101:29.60]If I get an extra hundred bucks for doing this, why wouldn't I?
[101:32.18]Thank you so much.
[101:33.56]I like that model quite a bit.
[101:35.44]The new ones look weirdly complicated.
[101:38.16]That's it, I guess.
[101:39.52]Good luck with the cleaning.
[101:41.00]I think I'm going to hang up now.
[101:43.18]Bye.
[101:51.21]You want the plate in there too?
[102:18.93]The one in the kitchen, right?
[102:27.68]What's on the back?
[102:30.94]What's that say?
[102:32.40]A slice of pizza.
[102:37.92]Cool.
[102:38.06]Alright, that's what I had to do, right?
[102:50.61]Trying to throw a watermelon out the window, don't mind me.
[102:55.61]Okay, sell.
[102:56.85]I have a lot of things to sell in here.
[102:58.39]This old jacket.
[102:59.53]Any plants, I think?
[103:04.15]No, that's good here.
[103:04.67]Alright, this place... I'm not going to do this yet.
[103:08.31]Let me make sure everything else is done.
[103:11.17]This is good.
[103:11.71]What?
[103:16.43]Oh, sus.
[103:22.20]This guy's an Among Us fan.
[103:23.50]Should I put the microwave under his bed?
[103:29.84]I think I'm good.
[103:35.05]I'll do downstairs.
[103:40.45]Okay, so nothing to sell.
[103:42.25]Oh yeah, there is a lot to sell down here.
[103:50.50]Flipper tool.
[103:51.62]Yep.
[103:52.03]Okay.
[103:52.89]It's reminding me.
[104:00.27]Anymore?
[104:06.86]We definitely hit that on the way out.
[104:10.55]I just realized something.
[104:17.11]This is a weird driveway.
[104:19.21]You're gonna hit this... How do you get to the street?
[104:31.22]That's so funny.
[104:33.66]He has to jump the curb.
[104:35.14]He's gonna hit that pole too.
[104:48.25]You drive down the sidewalk, I guess.
[104:53.22]Just drive down this way.
[104:54.18]Trash is done.
[105:03.43]Clean.
[105:07.41]Park point.
[105:08.23]Park point.
[105:08.93]Park point.
[105:09.39]Let's go.
[105:13.38]You can duplicate items.
[105:14.62]Do you need some extra chairs for this party?
[105:18.80]Yep.
[105:20.62]Cool.
[105:20.84]I don't need to use it now, but.
[105:32.72]We still need tires.
[105:37.45]Cool.
[105:37.87]Alright.
[105:38.09]Now it's just cleaning and then I have to just deal with the roommate room.
[105:45.39]Can you do the Pee Wee Herman dance to this, please?
[105:47.51]I was only under obligation to do the Pee Wee Herman dance.
[105:51.55]One time, and I did it.
[105:55.16]And that clip will live until all the servers are turned off on the internet, whenever that is.
[106:00.86]And in a thousand years, if the servers are still turned on, if you can still use the internet in 10,000 years, that clip will still exist.
[106:10.55]Isn't that fucking terrifying?
[106:21.87]There'll be people that would be making fun of me 10,000 years from now.
[106:30.24]I can't believe he did the peewee hermitage.
[106:33.52]That's how aliens laugh.
[106:36.90]I don't know.
[106:38.18]Who lives here in 10,000 years?
[106:39.07]Is it humans?
[106:46.66]I don't know.
[106:51.98]We'd be lucky if we make another 500.
[106:53.14]Let alone 10,000.
[107:04.75]He's getting existential.
[107:05.91]He's getting existential.
[107:11.05]10,000 years from now.
[107:13.73]Think about how many people will have existed.
[107:17.17]It's going to be crazy.
[107:20.50]Think of the database of just of like the trillions of fucking people that have lived.
[107:31.16]What happens?
[107:32.14]That's a long time.
[107:33.43]OK, time for the roommate room.
[107:51.21]Are you retiring because you have to leave to your home planet?
[107:56.48]Yes, I've collected the data that I need.
[108:00.06]Thank you for being so cooperative during my time here on Earth.
[108:07.08]I very much appreciate it.
[108:11.19]My findings will go to the Grand Emperor.
[108:19.15]My brain will be removed.
[108:20.94]and blend it up and then spread across a microscope.
[108:24.10]And then connect it to three or four thousand different computers to make sure they don't miss anything.
[108:28.89]So I bid you adieu.
[108:47.16]Delete the bed.
[108:47.74]Please delete the bed.
[108:50.20]I'm gonna barf if I look at it.
[109:04.19]Delete the bed.
[109:05.13]Don't clean the bed.
[109:07.45]I don't know if I'm clear.
[109:08.59]I don't know.
[109:09.29]Yeah, I don't know, dude.
[109:11.25]I think if I come in here and I see that, I will text the dude and say, hey, look, I'm just going to throw the bed away and I'm willing to even go half with you on it because I ain't fucking touching that, man.
[109:34.06]You can take a little bit out, but I ain't touching it.
[109:49.72]Is this mildew?
[109:50.80]I know.
[109:56.02]Stop scrapping his posters.
[109:59.66]Well, the roommate told me I had to.
[110:01.14]The roommate's like, get rid of all his shit.
[110:03.52]These are nice monitors.
[110:06.42]I mean, I guess I am selling them.
[110:07.56]It's not like I'm throwing them away.
[110:09.38]So somebody else is going to get these.
[110:15.26]I guess technically for someone to sell it, someone needs to buy it.
[110:19.16]So, somebody's buying this.
[110:31.62]A lot of shit in here that this dude wants out.
[110:40.14]What is that?
[110:49.84]This dude didn't put like a turd on his bookshelf, right?
[110:55.18]Yeah, I'm saving that one for later.
[110:57.45]I just want to make sure I keep it for awhile.
[111:00.73]It's a sliver of bacon.
[111:04.69]Probably what it actually is.
[111:13.15]I wish the trash bag exploded when you did that at the bottom of the stairs.
[111:19.23]Like Master Shake in Aqua Teen.
[111:21.37]That's funny.
[111:24.09]Which one of these is recycle?
[111:24.99]I don't think it matters.
[111:44.05]This looks like a carpet.
[111:45.49]This looks like a...
[111:48.35]A carpet like a really low... What do they call it when the fibers aren't really that tall?
[111:57.34]Looks like one of those floors that you see at like a... I don't know.
[112:01.92]Establishment, you know?
[112:04.95]That looks like one of those kind of like carpets you see at establishment.
[112:18.52]Low shag.
[112:19.40]Yeah, that's what it is.
[112:30.51]Give me this.
[112:30.81]Something behind the chair.
[112:52.48]Oh, fuck, I closed the bag.
[112:56.79]Is there six pieces of trash in here?
[112:58.43]Behind the bed?
[113:03.29]Oh, what is this?
[113:28.80]Did I turn off the squeegee sounds?
[113:33.53]Because that's like my favorite noise.
[113:34.63]It goes... I'll do it myself if they're not in the game.
[114:05.96]Pretty much done.
[114:13.59]What's left?
[114:14.45]Still some stuff to clean.
[114:16.11]I have to move the bed.
[114:19.81]It's probably behind the bed or something.
[114:28.34]What are these?
[114:29.08]These are weird like post-it notes.
[114:30.52]What are these?
[114:39.09]Oh shit, window.
[114:54.71]Jeremy, I just wanted to get this message to you.
[114:56.73]Etalyx lied to you.
[114:57.59]That image was from Harry Potter.
[114:59.25]They just lied to you and made you think it wasn't.
[115:01.75]It was actually from Harry Potter.
[115:03.23]They just want people to want to make you feel like you were stupid.
[115:13.20]That was right, right?
[115:14.82]So I was right.
[115:16.28]Everybody was like, no, he's, oh, he's Jerma.
[115:20.24]He's, you know, his brain is, he takes him a little while longer.
[115:24.00]Everybody thought I was stupid.
[115:27.02]You were all doing that on purpose.
[115:28.14]Okay.
[115:28.38]I get it.
[115:37.91]Close.
[115:38.69]Still trash.
[115:39.85]What do I need to sell the computer?
[115:43.10]Pretty much everything that's in the room.
[115:53.84]Sell the bed?
[115:54.34]Nope.
[116:07.91]Hey, look at that.
[116:10.73]That image wasn't actually from Harry Potter.
[116:12.89]Etalyx was telling the truth.
[116:14.21]What happens if you point this at yourself?
[116:20.45]I don't know, man.
[116:21.39]I don't know.
[116:24.55]I never thought about that.
[116:28.54]Like, if I open my mouth and hold this with the laser pointed right at one of my teeth, will it just sell one of my teeth?
[116:36.38]Will one of my teeth just disappear?
[116:41.38]Or will it decide that it's the whole entire person?
[116:44.98]That's a good question.
[116:51.18]Where's this last piece of trash in here?
[116:59.01]Where is it?
[117:03.87]Nothing behind the bed.
[117:04.71]And the drawers?
[117:09.11]Oh, there it is.
[117:09.67]Yep.
[117:19.58]Wile E. Coyote was just sawing underneath me.
[117:23.20]In a circle.
[117:23.74]I was about to go down.
[117:34.92]That's it, right?
[117:35.69]That's it.
[117:37.37]How come it's not three stars?
[117:39.05]What's going on here?
[117:47.50]The door not being able to close is brutal.
[117:53.19]Wait, it can't!
[117:54.17]Is that a flaw in the room or is that a flaw in me?
[118:01.03]Me.
[118:08.77]It was the microwave book.
[118:22.72]It's not in the garage.
[118:24.88]Oh, hold on.
[118:27.81]Maybe this is maybe it's mad that I didn't throw these away.
[118:35.47]No.
[118:44.06]What am I missing?
[118:46.14]The plate in the plate in the microwave.
[118:55.56]You think so?
[118:55.94]Does this turn on?
[119:10.63]That's weird.
[119:16.71]This is technically not trash either.
[119:18.05]Everything's done in here.
[119:26.72]I think it's down here.
[119:27.56]Oh, there's another room I didn't see.
[119:30.95]Thank goodness I looked at it.
[120:19.79]What?
[120:29.92]Captain Hook.
[120:33.24]I can't get over it.
[120:34.51]It's so stupid.
[120:38.41]But it's true.
[120:39.05]I hate that noise.
[120:40.15]So, yeah, that's fine.
[120:41.53]I have maybe a little Captain Hook.
[120:45.27]Alright.
[120:51.60]There we go.
[120:53.54]Perfect.
[120:54.38]Everything is completed.
[120:56.82]Let's go.
[120:58.00]Did you play some dubstep for us?
[121:05.07]Yeah.
[121:10.53]This is a sample that I had on my computer.
[121:26.01]Just a quick sample.
[121:30.79]Oh my God.
[121:31.15]You're so sweet.
[121:31.77]Thank you.
[121:32.11]I just got a like fresh, delicious water.
[121:49.93]What's your producer tag?
[122:02.32]I don't have one.
[122:04.91]I release all of my music anonymously.
[122:10.65]I got $11,000.
[122:11.27]This seems like it's probably one of the last starter ones.
[122:25.34]Alright, so this is just a clean house.
[122:27.34]Let me give me the pictures too.
[122:29.00]Yeah, it's just a mess.
[122:30.52]Especially the basement.
[122:32.12]Let's do it.
[122:42.23]Drew Keys told me you once called us freaks long ago.
[122:44.85]What's up with that?
[122:45.47]I think I've called you a freak probably a hundred times in the last three or four weeks.
[123:13.41]Wait, we're freaks?
[123:15.31]No, not all of you.
[123:16.17]Everybody's a freak.
[123:28.36]Who is, though?
[123:30.48]Well, how many people are here?
[123:32.16]I'd have to go down the list of every viewer and just say if they are or are not a freak.
[123:37.48]And, I mean, I could, but it would take probably 60 to 70 hours.
[123:41.48]So, well, maybe probably 150 hours.
[123:42.62]12,000?
[123:42.68]13,000 people?
[123:46.88]What is it?
[123:48.10]Yeah, if I individually, if each person gets five minutes to determine if you're a freak or not, that's five minutes times 12,000, which...
[124:01.29]Like a year.
[124:05.61]We could probably get it done.
[124:15.87]I'll save you some time.
[124:16.91]I am.
[124:17.59]Alright, let's save some time.
[124:21.97]We get a poll in the chat here.
[124:22.96]Let's do.
[124:23.62]Are you a freak or not?
[124:25.02]Just so we can because it's going to be a long time to go through them all.
[124:27.50]So.
[124:32.94]This is going to help me a lot because when we actually, when we do it, it's, uh, I just don't have to, all the usernames that say yes or no, I don't have, you know, I can split them up.
[124:42.32]I really appreciate it though.
[124:44.36]Saving me a lot of time.
[124:54.69]I'm going to start at the bottom this time.
[125:01.57]It was even the basement, even the basement.
[125:03.93]So we're going to go there.
[125:04.65]I wonder what the problem with the basement is.
[125:05.99]Bathroom is immaculate.
[125:07.25]There's nothing wrong with this at all.
[125:08.07]It kind of scares me because it's very, very dirty in the rest of the house, which kind of leads me to believe.
[125:17.42]I mean, this is kind of look at this.
[125:21.14]Um, no, it's never mind.
[125:22.60]It's not that bad.
[125:25.21]No.
[125:28.63]It could be worse.
[125:40.24]Nice.
[125:43.62]Trash bags can now fit much more trash.
[125:46.32]No need for all that running.
[125:47.42]Okay, good.
[125:53.30]This pole is way too long.
[126:04.13]I'm going to move the bed.
[126:04.91]I thought that was a door.
[126:16.38]The overwhelming majority of germamites are freaky.
[126:33.50]That's what a chat member said.
[126:34.44]I didn't say that.
[126:46.04]Freaky freak, but respectful.
[126:47.72]Come on.
[127:00.29]Freaky Friday.
[127:08.09]You know what I would, okay, in a situation, like, let's say, alright, like, let's say me and Ster, I'm just gonna name a random person that I know.
[127:13.71]We, like, ran into each other at full speed, and he became me and I became him.
[127:19.49]I'm telling you, in that situation, I'm not fucking around.
[127:23.34]I am going to say, look, Ster.
[127:27.24]Right now, I'm you and you're me.
[127:29.32]And I'm going to go sit down in a comfortable spot and give myself like 10 feet by 10 feet space.
[127:39.12]where I get myself a telephone um get myself like food and stuff I'm not moving I'm not doing anything I'm not touching any of their stuff I'm not gonna go and I'm literally gonna sit in a spot until we figure it out I'm not going anywhere I'm not going anywhere we are gonna we are gonna sit there and we're gonna figure it out
[128:07.39]No, like, oh my god, ha ha ha, no, I live Ster's life.
[128:10.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Ster, you and I sit the fuck down.
[128:14.44]We're not going anywhere.
[128:16.34]Until this is done.
[128:17.34]Oh my goodness.
[128:32.39]Yeah, knowing Ster, the second we switch bodies, it's like, whoa, freaky Friday, we just switched bodies.
[128:39.04]Okay, let's, by the time I say, okay, hold on a sec.
[128:42.16]By the time the S comes out, he's already sprinted out of the room.
[128:45.06]I'm going to have to chase him down.
[129:11.07]Somebody said, what Looney Tunes character are you?
[129:13.35]I think Daffy Duck and I are very, very connected.
[129:20.44]All the cartoon ducks, I relate to.
[129:26.70]I got Donald Duck.
[129:27.70]Oh my goodness.
[129:28.48]I get it.
[129:29.26]I get it.
[129:29.52]Everything enrages me.
[129:30.62]I'm just everything.
[129:31.23]I'm so annoyed by so many fucking things in this world.
[129:34.49]Daffy Duck.
[129:36.17]I like just having fun.
[129:36.99]I don't give a fuck about very many things.
[129:39.13]Whatever.
[129:40.63]Duckman.
[129:41.27]You know what I mean?
[129:42.46]What other fictional ducks are there?
[129:46.86]Howard the Duck.
[129:47.62]Oh yeah.
[129:49.54]If you're a fictional duck, I probably relate to you.
[129:52.68]Darkwing Duck.
[129:53.30]Absolutely.
[129:53.55]Absolutely.
[129:56.56]Can I put this up right now?
[129:59.58]Scrooge McDuck, 100%.
[130:00.34]What about Psyduck?
[130:17.12]I don't know anything about Psyduck besides... Is this wrong?
[130:22.78]But when I see a yellow duck... Psyduck is a yellow duck, and I see his hands up.
[130:29.08]On his head?
[130:31.00]Both of his hands are on his temples, kind of going... Is that the right character?
[130:37.17]Yeah.
[130:42.73]What are some of Psyduck's moves?
[130:44.65]Because let's figure this out.
[130:47.27]He's dumb and always has a migraine.
[130:50.67]Uh.
[130:53.09]I probably could.
[130:55.03]If you ask me to give you like a three word sentence on who I am.
[130:59.91]Dumb with a bunch of migraines, that's that you could that could come out.
[131:05.61]Yeah, I don't know how completely accurate that is.
[131:07.60]I'm dumb a lot in a lot of things, but.
[131:10.70]Yeah, I relate.
[131:11.52]Alright, we just sell everything in this entire room, almost the whole house, honestly.
[131:29.64]You can sprint even if you carry something in your hand.
[131:32.06]I was gonna say, yeah, I was moving slow.
[131:35.78]Oh, you're not dumb.
[131:39.76]Hey, I... Hey, hold on.
[131:44.94]Get that satisfying movement.
[131:51.23]I don't think I'm dumb but I'm of the opinion that I feel like I self-deprecate a lot because I don't want to inflate so high that I maybe I am dumb and I like I'm essentially saying I'm not I have to sell that
[132:21.23]There's very few cases where I actually genuinely want people to think that I like, oh, I know so much more than you do.
[132:29.05]I don't, I don't fucking care.
[132:30.69]You know what I mean?
[132:31.51]I just don't.
[132:46.06]Empty brain.
[132:50.52]This is a dirty window or?
[132:56.53]Whoa.
[132:59.29]I kind of want those.
[133:01.25]Do they make those?
[133:03.53]Wait, that's weird.
[133:04.39]How do you close them?
[133:06.09]Wait, how do you wait?
[133:06.99]Where are they?
[133:12.86]How do you close these?
[133:17.72]Shutters?
[133:21.28]I feel like I've been missing these from my life big time.
[133:32.83]Shutters.
[133:33.49]I mean, I've never had shutters in any place I've ever lived.
[133:38.84]It's a disaster out here.
[133:43.17]vacuuming some trash is too small to pick up by hand that's where the vacuum cleaner comes in when you come across a pile of broken glass tiny bits of brick or anything else you can't put into a trash bag vacuum ah nice
[134:16.84]So that's how you get the little pieces of glass.
[134:25.35]Why is there a bed in here?
[134:26.15]Oh, I put it in here.
[134:29.67]Wait.
[134:37.61]Is there a coffee shop?
[134:40.01]Slash house in this residential neighborhood?
[134:42.53]That's interesting.
[134:43.91]Just kind of in the neighborhood.
[134:48.07]This person has a coffee shop in their house.
[135:03.68]Yeah, I know a lot of establishments, sometimes people live in them, like upstairs or downstairs, right?
[135:10.19]But this looks very residential.
[135:11.79]This would be great, honestly.
[135:19.98]I've seen a few of those.
[135:21.22]Really?
[135:21.48]That's cool.
[135:26.28]I feel like that kind of would bring an interesting sense of community to a neighborhood.
[135:32.63]Like, oh, I'm going to get some coffee from Larry's house.
[135:37.97]He's literally four doors down.
[135:39.99]You want me to get rid of this too?
[135:46.26]Okay.
[135:47.16]New sign.
[136:00.72]the zoning laws yeah I don't know anything about that but get rid of everything sell the telephone too sell that sell everything else okay
[136:36.33]He's too used to the blood to notice it.
[136:39.29]You mean the one on the window?
[136:40.23]Dude, how cool is Squeaks' house?
[136:45.41]That little murder mystery was so fucking clever.
[136:48.13]It was awesome.
[136:56.79]Spoilers.
[136:57.53]Oh, you didn't see it yet.
[136:58.91]Well, hey.
[136:59.39]Hey.
[137:03.65]I guess that did happen literally like 12 hours ago.
[137:09.11]Hey, don't worry.
[137:09.97]There were... There were 24 houses last night.
[137:15.48]Can you believe that?
[137:16.94]We saw 24 different builds.
[137:24.42]That was so fun.
[137:31.67]Everybody was such a good sport too.
[137:34.10]I always feel bad when it's like, oh, hey, yeah, the event's gonna be like five hours, and it's like, uh, Jerma, it's been about eight.
[137:42.20]I gotta fucking go to bed, dude.
[137:43.98]So, I appreciate it.
[137:52.73]Thankfully, the people that really had to go, go, like really go, um, they got out in perfect timing, so that's good.
[138:02.46]Yeah, Bonnie and S-Fan were such good sports too.
[138:04.64]They just figured out how to open, they just installed the game.
[138:09.69]And for just installing the game, they did a great job.
[138:15.81]And I told you, the only reason to do that event was to just, you know, just do something fun.
[138:20.54]That's all it was about.
[138:24.58]I was still laughing about Connor on the train this morning.
[138:27.10]I woke up.
[138:28.50]There was like 10 to 20 different distinct my stomach hurts moments from last night.
[138:33.51]That's one of the funniest things I think I've seen in a long time.
[138:39.03]So you can like hear the fucking conductor in the background when C-Dog is talking about what he's and you can't even understand him.
[138:45.78]And Conrad's pants is like, yeah, yeah, man.
[138:49.82]Oh, yeah.
[138:50.34]Yep.
[138:51.10]Yeah, that's totally true, dude.
[138:53.10]And if nobody could understand a single thing he was fucking saying.
[138:58.38]Spoilers.
[138:58.92]I'm sorry.
[138:59.54]I know.
[138:59.84]But like, I have to talk about it because I just it just happened.
[139:02.35]It was so it was too funny.
[139:07.27]Don't worry.
[139:07.65]There's like 30 of those last night of where it was hysterical.
[139:19.59]At one point, I think you could hear like... And then you hear the train moving.
[139:25.54]It's just God.
[139:26.52]Where is he going?
[139:34.03]Where was he?
[139:34.79]Where, like, where was he going?
[139:37.35]He was, at one moment, he was, he was in the stream and he's like, hey, I gotta run.
[139:42.23]He's like, oh, okay, but hold on, he's still here and he's, like, traveling.
[139:46.25]Ugh.
[139:48.83]It was so fucking funny.
[139:57.54]Yeah, the passengers on the train are just listening to this guy like... Yeah, so when you go down to hell... Yeah, we've died.
[140:05.11]And when you go down there... I'm trying to do a sea dog impression.
[140:08.03]Let's see.
[140:08.85]My voice is not nearly smooth enough to do this, but... He must have just sounded ridiculous.
[140:16.28]People... I don't... What the hell do you even... You look at that guy and go, what the fuck is he talking about?
[140:21.66]Yeah, so when we go to my funeral...
[140:24.55]why is this guy talking about his what do you mean your funeral you're alive what uh okay still sell the bed really that room is done this room is needs to be cleaned where is the dirt I want to find it without the help
[140:54.25]Can I?
[141:06.43]Both top and bottom, right?
[141:07.49]Yep.
[141:16.43]Oh, he's in Japan!
[141:22.66]It just sounded like a guy on the train.
[141:25.64]I forgot he was in Japan.
[141:35.22]That's right.
[141:37.24]Yeah, but there's plenty of English speakers in Japan.
[141:41.00]If you could speak English in Japan, that was an interesting train ride.
[141:58.31]We are done in here.
[142:02.79]What's wrong with this place?
[142:04.45]Dirt.
[142:05.83]Hmm.
[142:06.74]Hmm.
[142:21.29]Hmm.
[142:21.59]Boston boy forgets there's other countries outside.
[142:24.47]I did not say that.
[142:26.09]I just said I slipped my mind that that's right.
[142:30.33]He is in Japan.
[142:31.48]I know that Japan exists.
[142:36.82]And I know that Connor lives in Japan.
[142:39.34]But it was one of those like, oh, that's right.
[142:41.84]He is in Japan.
[142:42.80]Okay, that's right.
[142:44.24]Do you like Boston cream pies?
[142:48.04]No.
[142:49.54]I don't like custard.
[142:52.96]Sorry, bro.
[142:55.21]I think we're almost done with this one.
[142:58.86]This room is done.
[143:00.96]So what else is there?
[143:02.18]I don't like the kind of custard that's in a Boston cream pie.
[143:12.12]It's not all this stuff, right?
[143:17.10]No?
[143:20.54]Oh, here we go.
[143:24.12]You're fake Bostonian.
[143:27.67]Well, let me give you, can I give you the reasons why?
[143:29.41]I, this, this is, this is not just for this type of food.
[143:36.69]I like for like, like a, a sweet dessert.
[143:41.87]I don't want it to be, there's a point where it's either.
[143:46.38]It's in that weird in-between of being too thin, but thick at the same time.
[143:51.69]And I don't like that.
[143:53.85]It's still kind... It's like a viscous liquid.
[143:58.09]It's not fluffy.
[144:00.73]I really only like fluffy stuff.
[144:03.82]Kind of like a custard type sweets.
[144:07.00]I don't really like runny... Like custard is kind of... It's not... It's got a weird kind of gel kind of texture to it.
[144:17.31]I like fluffy.
[144:19.67]You either gotta go one or the other.
[144:21.45]Fluffy or all the way it's like a liquid.
[144:25.10]Like a milkshake or something.
[144:26.78]That in between is just something I don't really like.
[144:34.65]What about, yeah, pudding?
[144:36.17]Pudding is kind of like that too.
[144:38.22]I don't, I'm not a big fan of pudding.
[144:40.12]It's like that gelatin kind of texture.
[144:44.22]But, but wait.
[144:47.36]Wait a second.
[144:48.60]Wait.
[144:50.03]If you transform pudding into frozen pudding, like a pudding pop, it, it is now a different substance.
[144:58.77]It's no longer that weird kind of cold gel-like substance.
[145:04.08]It is now a frozen pudding pop.
[145:06.92]And oh my god, guys.
[145:09.04]They don't really make them anymore.
[145:11.37]But all you need is a package of chocolate pudding.
[145:14.39]A package of vanilla instant pudding.
[145:18.51]You just mix it up with milk.
[145:19.67]It's so easy to do.
[145:20.69]Put it into like a little piper thing to like squeeze it into a mold for popsicles.
[145:29.76]Put a couple sticks in it.
[145:32.67]And let me tell you right now, that's... Oh my god, you make your own pudding pops.
[145:37.43]Did you grow up in the 50s?
[145:39.84]You just don't get it.
[145:40.78]And that's alright.
[145:41.40]And I understand.
[145:41.96]But you just don't get it.
[145:42.90]And... You will if you have one.
[145:46.96]And it's okay.
[145:47.86]You just don't get it.
[145:51.08]Get a bidet, right?
[145:52.06]You don't get it.
[145:52.49]Alright, why do I have one star?
[145:55.01]Did I miss a door?
[145:59.59]Did I miss a door?
[146:09.11]Oh, wait, okay.
[146:10.08]Hold on.
[146:10.94]Yep.
[146:11.18]It's members.
[146:11.58]It's just like oh the basement is fucked up You repeat the recipe please I only mentally chimed in when you said pudding pop
[146:34.50]Uh, there's a couple of just really easy ones that can give you exact stuff, but it really is just a package of instant pudding.
[146:43.38]Um, like a cup of milk.
[146:46.13]Just air, like regular milk.
[146:48.13]I don't know if you can make it with milk substitutes.
[146:49.77]I've never really tried, but you might be able to.
[146:52.05]I mean, like frozen stuff so much.
[146:58.94]I don't know.
[146:59.44]That's a good question.
[147:03.19]I think it's always been like that.
[147:04.05]I've always just loved ice cream and popsicles and... Dude.
[147:11.83]Okay.
[147:13.09]You guys know those freeze pops?
[147:18.41]They're the stick and it's literally liquid.
[147:22.43]They sell them in a massive box.
[147:25.64]There's like a thousand of them in a box.
[147:28.41]Those are amazing, and I remember one time, I bought a box of those.
[147:33.15]And it was hundreds, it was hundreds, it was hundreds of them.
[147:35.63]Had to have been at least a few hundred in a box.
[147:37.81]I bought a huge one.
[147:40.11]And I ate the whole entire thing over the course of like, I think like a couple years.
[147:46.83]I had every single one.
[147:49.67]Over the course of like three years.
[148:00.70]It was just so easy to be like, yo, I want a snack.
[148:03.44]What do I want today?
[148:06.76]Well, that was very easy because I'm going to have a freeze pop.
[148:11.44]It's so simple.
[148:12.20]It's right there.
[148:12.78]Just snip off the top and you're done.
[148:15.05]That's a long time.
[148:17.51]I may be embellishing a little, but it was a very, it was an extended period and I ate a hundred of them.
[148:31.14]Frozen grapes are better alternative.
[148:33.84]But yeah, as I've gotten a little older, you know, it's not like, oh, I eat cookies and candies and sweets and oh, Willy Wonka.
[148:41.46]Oh, I love, uh, spoob, spoogizzles and, and gobstoppers.
[148:46.66]And no, like, I mean, I'm almost 40.
[148:49.28]I can't like just eat trash every day.
[148:52.32]Although I say that, but you always say I'm trying to eat better, trying to eat better.
[149:06.14]How's Otto?
[149:07.48]Otto is doing fantastic.
[149:10.40]He has to get his teeth cleaned soon.
[149:27.01]I was going to do it, I think like earlier this year.
[149:33.03]Or mid this year.
[149:33.85]I got really, really busy.
[149:36.99]But yeah, he'll be good.
[149:39.97]He's had his own before.
[149:40.59]What about cheesecake?
[149:45.53]Cheesecake is incredible.
[149:55.42]A cheesecake with raspberry sauce.
[150:01.48]I've
[150:03.39]It's up there at S tier.
[150:08.14]I don't know what I put Cheesecake at like five years ago when I did that tier list about desserts.
[150:12.72]I don't even know if it was on it.
[150:16.18]But it is S tier.
[150:33.58]My joke was so funny the mods kept it for themselves.
[150:39.81]That's a really fun way to say that you got banned for 10 minutes.
[150:51.44]Is there nothing else?
[150:52.30]Yeah, I got everything.
[150:53.32]What else do I need to do for three stars?
[150:54.82]Come on.
[150:55.52]Ah, this.
[150:59.90]That's not three.
[151:01.70]Oh, the windows.
[151:15.18]Good.
[151:24.49]I can wear and wear the cleaning sounds.
[151:27.37]Oh.
[151:28.51]Sorry.
[151:28.93]That's it in here.
[151:32.51]So what am I missing?
[151:40.19]Outside in the backyard.
[151:50.71]Alright, I got three, but I'm going to do the whole thing because... I feel like it.
[151:59.50]That's it.
[152:00.66]Three stars.
[152:01.54]Thank you.
[152:02.04]Alright, I'm curious what happens now.
[152:03.14]Hey, sound effect boy.
[152:10.14]What am I paying you for?
[152:11.06]Get back to squeaking now.
[152:12.47]Hey, I'm retired.
[152:25.35]A sound effect boy.
[152:26.69]That's not an excuse.
[152:34.55]I'm retired.
[152:35.15]I don't make sound effects anymore.
[152:37.69]Childish.
[152:38.31]I'm an adult now.
[152:41.47]No, I'm a grown up and I've retired.
[152:43.05]I don't make sound effects anymore.
[152:44.61]Childish.
[152:48.37]I thought about this a few times.
[152:50.33]And I've absolutely changed and grown a lot over the last 20 years.
[152:56.47]I think I've gotten a little more mature, I've mellowed out a lot, definitely.
[153:00.55]But there is one thing that I will never stop doing.
[153:04.61]Until I'm a hundred.
[153:06.31]And that's making fucking sound effects.
[153:08.77]Just never gonna ha- That will never stop happening.
[153:27.57]Are there really no awards this year?
[153:29.75]We'll talk about that this weekend.
[153:31.55]But there's something else I think I would want to do that's interesting and fun.
[153:39.45]Another thing too is I'm probably going to be traveling a lot during this kind of holiday season.
[153:43.22]There's a lot of people that I haven't seen in a long time that I want to see.
[153:47.68]So I might not be around in that like area in the last couple weeks of December into the first couple weeks of January.
[153:54.40]So I got to figure that out, but...
[153:57.40]We'll do something.
[154:00.59]It's not going to be like an awards ceremony.
[154:04.05]But we'll do something.
[154:04.69]We'll hang out.
[154:05.35]Do something interesting.
[154:18.49]Oh, it is dirty.
[154:21.52]Slowly, I'm going to work on my own place.
[154:25.50]Little by little.
[154:34.57]You ever going to do a rumble again?
[154:35.61]Ooh, new stuff.
[154:40.93]No emails here.
[154:44.22]I mean, here's the thing about stuff like that.
[154:48.70]We've done so many rumbles that if I ever do one, if I ever wanted to do one, I'd want to make sure it was good and kind of worth doing because when you do enough of them,
[154:59.93]Because there's all kinds of characters that are made, and all kinds of situations, and... The new games are kind of... They're not really as... I don't know, they don't really scratch the itch for me anymore as they used to.
[155:11.70]Like, ever since, like, 2K14, 2K13, 2K15.
[155:16.63]Those games in particular, I mean.
[155:18.95]They kind of just don't really do it for me anymore.
[155:24.95]And I'm more, I'm, I'm a kind of, I mean, those of you that have been in here for like 10 years, 12 years, I don't like to do stuff just to do it.
[155:33.42]I don't want to, I don't want to just do a rumble just to like, okay, yeah, let's do a rumble.
[155:36.22]Of course we're going to do it.
[155:37.62]And it's like, yeah, that was, that was alright, I guess.
[155:39.36]I want them to be all like fun and entertaining and interesting and engaging.
[155:42.42]I just don't want to do them just to do them because then you kind of like just phoning it in.
[155:47.27]Like do them, do them.
[155:47.93]We got to do them every year, every six months.
[155:50.68]So, yeah.
[155:51.98]If it ever happens again, it will.
[155:53.12]If not, then I'm happy with the ones that have happened.
[155:58.06]Alright, what are we going to do?
[156:02.30]Yeah, Dusk did get an HD kind of patch.
[156:04.57]That's cool.
[156:06.31]I was looking at that the other day.
[156:08.83]Okay, I run a small bookshop by the beach.
[156:12.07]My girlfriend is a barista and we would like to make space for her coffee shop.
[156:17.57]Okay.
[156:19.82]New furniture to buy and a wall to paint.
[156:22.88]Alright, I have my house.
[156:24.86]Still no houses for sale.
[156:29.07]But we now have to paint.
[156:33.05]This game is meaty.
[156:34.07]Are you still Jerma or are you Jerry?
[156:46.64]Um...
[156:49.66]I think, I think Jerry is Germo.
[156:53.44]Okay.
[156:53.98]What?
[156:55.96]That's a big reveal.
[156:57.96]That's like a, we're in season 13 of Germo 985.
[157:01.43]That's a big, that's a major late into the series plot reveal.
[157:07.75]We're in season 13.
[157:08.37]Gee, what?
[157:14.59]And then I'm going to turn the stream off now.
[157:16.09]I'm leaving you on a cliffhanger.
[157:28.65]Big spoilers for season 13.
[157:30.07]Yep.
[157:40.03]Also, the command is working, right?
[157:42.59]Can we check that?
[157:43.11]I just want to make sure it works.
[157:46.64]I tested it before, but... Does the house sliver command work?
[157:49.98]It does.
[157:50.56]Cool.

[163:41.73]I don't know, it could, maybe, there's probably a function for it.
[163:56.47]Okay.
[163:57.35]Are we selling, we're only selling the bed.
[163:59.05]So you wanna sell the bed, and then you want this.
[164:03.06]I gotta spend 2700 bucks?
[164:15.02]Alright, suede.
[164:24.01]Plastic, give him a plastic bed.
[164:26.59]Just a plastic bed with a plastic mattress and plastic pillows.
[164:36.69]Ah, gray.
[164:54.58]Perfect.
[165:04.39]This bed kind of looks sad.
[165:06.97]And I mean literally.
[165:08.65]I don't mean like, oh, there's something... This bed kind of looks like it is sad.
[165:13.09]It's alright.
[165:23.77]OK, unpack.
[165:24.21]What do you have in here?
[165:33.47]You know what it is?
[165:33.99]It's a lot of trinkets.
[165:40.44]This is a really, really nice, like pretty room.
[165:43.54]There's a lot of well, it's nice.
[165:44.68]I like the.
[165:46.48]The nice room.
[165:48.94]It's just a lot of stuff.
[165:52.06]I don't like a lot of stuff.
[165:57.29]A desk like this?
[165:58.05]I don't really want this.
[166:00.43]I want that.
[166:02.32]I put it there, so what am I talking about?
[166:06.42]Call me back.
[166:07.36]XOXO.
[166:08.06]Have a great day.
[166:11.06]Hey, thanks.
[166:12.34]Is this coffee dirty?
[166:18.67]Oh, that's the design on the mug.
[166:23.62]Yeah, that's alright.
[166:24.96]I don't know.
[166:25.30]I don't know if I want this here, though.
[166:26.66]I would.
[166:27.14]This would be somewhere else.
[166:32.12]Yeah, I don't get that like over here.
[166:33.66]I need space.
[166:34.38]I need room to breathe.
[166:43.69]This one is done, right?
[166:52.71]Yes.
[166:55.16]That is not good.
[166:56.32]Keeping the... Was that a heater?
[167:06.60]Staff only.
[167:18.77]Almonder.
[167:19.31]Wifi.
[167:19.89]Almonder.
[167:20.45]Almonder.
[167:20.79]Wifi.
[167:21.23]Wifi.
[167:22.21]Almonder.
[167:33.71]Well, that's like.
[167:34.15]It's like a seven year old reference.
[167:42.70]I think it's please right here.
[167:45.14]Alright, what do you need unpack and buy?
[167:51.25]Alright, let's see what you got.
[167:52.23]I thought that was a alarm.
[168:33.15]Okay, back upstairs.
[168:38.86]Candle.
[168:42.23]Is that a candle?
[168:43.89]Yeah.
[168:46.69]Candle.
[168:50.55]Maybe, you know what?
[168:51.12]Maybe I'll light a candle tonight.
[169:10.61]Get a candle warmer?
[169:13.91]What's a candle warmer?
[169:14.81]Alright, now I need to buy this.
[169:18.34]It needs to go in here.
[169:19.22]Okay.
[169:26.84]A coffee table for here.
[169:42.84]I'm doing this to enrage you, so... I just want to make sure that I'm very clear about it.
[169:59.73]Um... Oh, wait.
[170:02.91]Okay, that makes sense.
[170:14.30]It's on the windowsill.
[170:17.52]And you want a... A Fittonia.
[170:24.17]I can handle that.
[170:29.67]Ah, the structural integrity.
[170:31.61]Structural integrity that's going through the window.
[170:40.56]You know what it is?
[170:42.54]I don't really like patterns.
[170:45.58]or furniture or for walls.
[170:48.52]I think that's why this I don't really I don't I don't really vibe with this place at all.
[170:52.77]I don't like patterns.
[170:54.23]I like solid or gradients or accents.
[170:56.71]I don't really like patterns.
[170:59.67]You're boring?
[171:00.49]That's alright.
[171:00.89]Hey, hey, look.
[171:04.14]If we're- if you and I were neighbors, I can have my just clean, gradient, gray, blue, you know, some greens, some oranges, that's fine.
[171:16.16]You are free to, in the privacy of your own home, make a fucking Dr. Seuss house.
[171:23.93]That is- that's up to- if you vibe with that, that's how you vibe.
[171:39.28]And this.
[171:50.57]See, I am just bad with design, right?
[171:52.82]Because I don't know what to do with all this.
[171:55.60]Like, who... Okay, where do you...
[171:58.23]When I'm thinking about where people are sitting, right?
[171:59.68]Like if you're sitting here, you want to put your feet up here and then you put your, put your fucking food on this or this has to, over here because you can lounge this way.
[172:09.38]I, my feng shui is off.
[172:14.36]And then this is, this is like a little table that goes kind of like right here.
[172:18.55]The radiator's right there though.
[172:20.67]I gotta be careful.
[172:21.35]I don't, okay.
[172:23.49]No, that's, no.
[172:24.41]What is that?
[172:25.59]Is this a table?
[172:26.27]Is this a chair?
[172:27.31]What is this?
[172:39.18]That's a footrest?
[172:43.70]I feel like that's not big enough.
[172:46.80]Look at how big my legs are.
[172:51.40]Maybe it is big enough.
[173:01.03]Thanks for... Items for sitting on.
[173:03.03]Yeah, I would probably sit on that.
[173:06.18]Or...
[173:08.40]I don't know.
[173:09.14]This is like the arm wrestle table.
[173:13.21]Like... Or like this way.
[173:20.50]I think we're good up here.
[173:21.38]We are.
[173:21.84]Anything else upstairs?
[173:23.06]I don't believe so.
[173:24.26]Wait.
[173:24.68]Bathroom?
[173:25.76]Nothing.
[173:26.32]Good.
[173:48.70]How is that even a good arm wrestling chair?
[173:50.54]I don't know.
[173:55.73]You could use it.
[173:59.19]And now we're going to deal with this.
[174:00.29]And we have to paint too.
[174:04.09]Okay, sell all this crap.
[174:20.01]That was an interesting chair.
[174:53.87]It's a little dirty in here.
[175:08.51]Okay, let's go.
[175:15.55]What the hell?
[175:16.25]You just poisoned the food.
[175:29.05]vacuuming poisoning There's not another setting that you flip on the vacuum to have it be a spray poison mist mode
[175:59.63]What about the bacteria on the vacuum?
[176:03.42]Yeah.
[176:08.02]Poison damage vacuum.
[176:11.82]That sounds kind of like a fun... weapon.
[176:15.64]That's like a fun D&D custom weapon.
[176:22.45]Hold on.
[176:24.71]Did I clean everything?
[176:26.19]Everything is good, right?
[176:29.07]I want to move this out of the way.
[176:30.37]What is all this?
[176:32.31]It's like a table or... Okay, for one second, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the yellow circle over here.
[176:43.12]And I thought there was somebody in that room.
[176:46.98]I just had a half a second freak out.
[176:49.70]What is it?
[176:50.40]Who's in there?
[177:00.91]I don't want these on the floor, but there's no room.
[177:03.87]They will be when I buy stuff.
[177:06.15]Okay.
[177:06.88]Unpack.
[177:11.12]The juicer.
[177:11.56]Espresso.
[177:13.94]Espresso machine.
[177:17.10]Yep.
[177:33.15]Uh, well, there's a theme going on here, so.
[177:49.67]Cups down here.
[177:53.41]Nice.
[178:01.54]You're not matching them with the color.
[178:04.74]What are you... What are you doing?
[178:08.49]You didn't match them with the... What are you fucking doing?
[178:12.25]Stop.
[178:12.71]Just fucking relax, guys.
[178:34.30]Oh boy, OK, this is getting there, though.
[178:38.17]It's a lot better.
[178:38.65]I need two of these tables.
[178:45.29]OK, maybe like here and here.
[178:52.09]It's so funny.
[178:52.81]So, I mean, all the grades were just for fun, right?
[178:57.27]But I remember the critique I gave to Will Neff about the, you know, no spoilers, where, I don't like the spacing of this.
[179:06.45]It was exactly, exactly the same.
[179:09.13]This is the exact same distance that he had his spacing, and I criticized him for it.
[179:35.01]Where is it?
[179:40.12]You should retroactively boost his score.
[179:42.40]Uru did a great job.
[179:46.72]It was... It was great.
[179:50.51]There was such a great balance of wacky and crazy and informative and fun and interesting.
[179:56.59]It was... I was very happy.
[180:03.84]This is trash, isn't it?
[180:06.94]No, it's not.
[180:10.10]You want a table.
[180:10.86]I don't know where this goes.
[180:27.29]That's not right.
[180:29.87]That's not right.
[180:47.01]Yeah, I'm... Okay, I want to be able to... I want to be able to do the Tom Cruise slide into frame with my socks on.
[180:55.54]You can't do that in this place.
[180:58.52]To me, there always has to be, in any place that I ever occupy, at least, like, six straight feet of slideable material.
[181:13.64]What do I do with this?
[181:14.46]I guess this could be for... Okay, hold on.
[181:21.81]Maybe in the corner like this?
[181:23.92]And then...
[181:50.53]I don't know if this can work.
[181:53.07]I feel like... I don't know.
[181:53.98]I'm not sure if I... Maybe I can put this table over here.
[181:56.50]Because there's going to be chairs here too, isn't there?
[182:07.37]Perfect.
[182:12.11]Are you the imposterous sus guy?
[182:13.31]No, that's my twin brother, Jerry.
[182:14.33]Okay.
[182:23.21]He sucks, by the way.
[182:26.01]We have a whole sibling rivalry thing.
[182:28.19]Rivalry.
[182:28.99]We have a whole sibling rivalry thing going.
[182:34.31]I'm so much more like chill and mellow.
[182:37.39]He's just fucking annoying.
[182:52.23]This one.
[182:53.11]No, this is the standing one.
[182:54.03]You put your elbow down.
[183:01.17]That's it for this one.
[183:10.26]The door is blocked.
[183:19.00]What door is blocked?
[183:26.26]Yep.
[183:29.86]I see.
[183:31.26]I see.
[183:47.08]How do people design places like restaurants and coffee shops and how like what do I do with these?
[184:04.71]I think this is the problem.
[184:05.55]These things are going to go somewhere else.
[184:07.99]Against this wall.
[184:10.37]Okay, now the problem is now solved.
[184:13.00]The problem has been completely solved.
[184:18.44]Because now I have room to do this.
[184:34.25]You're messing up all my... What?
[184:46.76]That's kind of better.
[184:49.82]Cool.
[185:00.02]Oh, no, I forgot.
[185:01.02]That's a chocolate chip and toffee ice cream pattern.
[185:05.72]It's not dirty.
[185:49.70]a clown puke.
[185:54.47]Oh, why do I have such a low score?
[185:57.15]Outside?
[185:57.55]Is outside a mess?
[186:10.04]Oh, I have to paint the wall.
[186:11.26]I have to buy a bunch of shit out here.
[186:18.06]Oh, I see.
[186:18.90]Ah, OK, let's go.
[186:24.14]Let's go.
[186:24.66]Yeah.
[186:26.64]Yeah.
[186:27.46]You want more?
[186:48.02]Yeah, let's make sure that the most amount of people get attacked by the most amount of seagulls.
[186:53.82]Let's put them as close to over here as possible.
[187:03.87]You don't want more, do you?
[187:05.37]You want more tables?
[187:10.43]Am I missing how many?
[187:11.27]This seems like a lot.
[187:32.76]I have to go in the fence.
[187:34.44]Oh shit, whatever.
[187:45.05]You're a buffoon.
[187:45.83]Let me try this.
[188:05.65]Cool, it works.
[188:09.84]That's it.
[188:10.50]I need now I need a like a birdhouse.
[188:35.49]That's so funny you can put any of these patterns on here.
[189:08.68]I don't... This doesn't look very good, but I'm just looking at everything.
[189:17.31]This is way bigger.
[189:18.41]I was like, what kind of bird is going in here?
[189:21.51]What?
[189:21.83]This is for like kids to play with or something?
[189:25.09]What the hell was that?
[189:27.45]Does this need to go here?
[189:33.84]It does need to... Okay, I need to rethink this because this... Hold on.
[189:40.29]It's a playhouse.
[189:41.33]Yeah.
[189:41.49]Okay.
[189:41.87]Wait a minute.
[189:42.44]Wait a minute.
[189:42.88]Wait a minute.
[189:43.54]This is all wrong.
[189:46.38]This is completely wrong.
[190:09.70]So much more room now.
[190:10.68]No, actually, keep this here.
[190:11.50]Keep that here.
[190:21.19]There you go.
[190:26.57]Why table's in the sand?
[190:28.95]Um, because it's a beach.
[190:30.93]It's a beach theme.
[190:56.67]It's particle board Yeah, yeah, make a place for the kids to play but make sure it's the cheapest shit possible
[191:13.05]Excuse me, sir, for an extra $6, we could make it not particle board.
[191:19.85]I don't give a fuck.
[191:23.99]Okay.
[191:24.35]Ooh, what is this?
[191:54.97]What is he doing?
[191:56.21]I don't know.
[191:56.97]I'm just fucking around.
[192:05.04]I don't get scored on this.
[192:06.56]You just have to put it here.
[192:07.82]Yeah, we're good.
[192:12.78]He's trying so hard to be funny.
[192:15.31]Like, look, ready?
[192:15.83]Oh my god, I put this funny thing in here.
[192:30.97]I better see a ton of XDs.
[192:33.13]It was wicked funny.
[192:37.28]Alright, what am I missing?
[192:39.34]Backyard?
[192:39.70]There's a lot of stuff over here.
[192:49.08]No.
[193:06.70]What is going?
[193:07.18]What is this?
[193:12.21]Is this a garden or is this?
[193:16.07]A. Is it a grave?
[193:20.53]No, it's a garden, right?
[193:23.46]Yeah, this is a garden.
[193:24.22]This is a garden.
[193:25.08]This is a garden.
[193:26.52]This is a garden guys.
[193:31.30]It's a garden.
[193:39.66]Yeah, let's go with that.
[193:45.28]Cool, OK.
[193:47.22]I'm missing something very important.
[193:50.58]It's the painting.
[193:55.12]Two of these.
[193:55.74]Put them like here and here.
[194:01.91]I'm really bad with chair placement, so we're just going to have people.
[194:05.73]You know what?
[194:07.69]Nobody talks to each other anymore.
[194:39.46]Actually talk to the person you're here with.
[194:42.67]Put down the phone, put down the iPad.
[194:45.09]Communicate!
[194:45.79]Alright, now let's paint that wall.
[195:00.06]Where is that wall?
[195:04.46]Wait, is it in the back area?
[195:05.90]Where is it?
[195:07.14]Back here?
[195:07.54]It's back here, yeah.
[195:19.79]Trash?
[195:20.65]Yep.
[195:20.75]Remember when you had to call your friend in the 90s if you wanted to hang out?
[195:29.41]Yeah.
[195:34.15]Too much information now.
[195:34.95]Alright, so I put the painting thing here.
[195:41.23]So what color do they want?
[195:42.17]They wanted this.
[195:46.54]Pink paint faded.
[195:47.58]Okay.
[195:52.12]How much do I need in house slipper two?
[195:54.42]Let's find out.
[196:03.75]Oops.
[196:05.59]Oh, okay.
[196:06.01]I didn't... I have to set it again.
[196:13.94]Whoa.
[196:14.66]Okay, that's... That's very... That feels very nice.
[196:26.47]Is it actually putting small amounts of paint on if I only do one pass?
[196:31.53]Kind of.
[196:44.01]This will be leveled up too, but this I like this.
[196:48.51]Scared the shit out of me for some reason.
[196:57.55]It's a temporary fade.
[196:58.99]It is a temporary fade.
[197:00.33]Look at this watch.
[197:11.41]Technology is so cool.
[197:21.62]So I wonder, can you paint without the border?
[197:23.34]You probably can.
[197:23.82]And not see the lines.
[197:28.66]I'm almost certain you can.
[197:40.65]Beautiful.
[197:41.31]Hey, look at that.
[197:52.67]Still some stuff to sell in here.
[197:57.09]My selling.
[198:01.45]Oh, no, that's duplicate.
[198:11.70]Cleaning.
[198:19.20]What's dirty here?
[198:27.05]Ceiling?
[198:30.31]Something on the sink?
[198:32.19]Maybe a window?
[198:32.69]Yeah.
[198:34.69]Yep.
[198:41.17]Windows, you idiot.
[198:42.43]Time that person out for one second.
[198:55.68]Done.
[198:56.92]Nice.
[198:58.92]Almost 10,000 coins.
[199:14.90]Furnishing homes is one of the Flipper's basic tasks, and now you can learn how to assemble furniture on your own.
[199:22.46]Open the Assembly tab and see which courses are available.
[199:25.64]Finishing them will give you a store discount for the same type of items you learned how to assemble.
[199:30.68]Assembly?
[199:31.40]Picture frame assembly?
[199:39.04]How does this work?
[199:42.97]Welcome to your first assembly course.
[199:45.69]First, gather the parts.
[199:46.97]Open the boxes.
[199:50.82]I thought I unplugged my cord there.
[199:53.54]Open the box you see around the room to put the parts in your inventory.
[199:56.16]Then look for assembly icons and press left click.
[200:00.47]Okay, go through the steps and use the parts you've gathered to assemble an item.
[200:03.15]You can move the camera with right click.
[200:05.49]Okay.
[200:09.23]Okay.
[200:30.74]Okay.
[200:38.20]I think I fucked it up already.
[200:49.00]Control.
[200:49.56]Oh, wait a minute.
[200:53.10]Oh, okay.
[200:53.48]Control left.
[200:58.85]What?
[201:03.56]Okay, this is kind of fun.
[201:05.56]I like this.
[201:05.98]I just want to see what happens.
[201:19.74]Cool!
[201:20.82]Am I gonna be able to build couches and beds and bookshelves and...
[201:33.29]Oh, can I restart?
[201:34.22]It actually is important that you do it right.
[201:39.76]Stop on the green.
[201:40.38]I know, I was just thinking if I could break it.
[201:44.56]Every picture frame has a lower price in the store.
[201:47.76]To unlock new assembly courses, finish more jobs from your emails.
[201:51.51]Remember to check the course list from time to time to see what new courses are available.
[201:55.59]Let me do that one again.
[201:58.11]You can speed run these.
[201:59.25]That's so funny.
[202:00.05]I wonder if people are going to do that.
[202:04.41]Alright, we gotta go.
[202:25.49]Go.
[202:25.87]Done.
[202:28.39]Too slow.
[202:29.75]Under 10 seconds.
[202:38.52]I feel like there's a lot in this game.
[202:43.28]I'm really curious about the houses, like actual, like the full houses.
[202:49.80]Assembling a desk or something would be kind of fun, especially if there's like a five minute time limit.
[203:00.16]I want to... Okay, let me do this.
[203:05.56]What time is it right now?
[203:06.72]It's 1.30.
[203:07.08]I wanted to be kind of out today around 2.
[203:11.88]And also keep in mind, I'm going to be playing this the entire weekend.
[203:15.17]So every day, today, tomorrow, and Sunday, I'll be live.
[203:22.03]I want to pace myself a little bit because last night was like 8 hours and I'm still recovering today.
[203:33.84]My whole body hurts from just laughing at shit.
[203:42.10]And laughing for me is like being punched in the stomach 100 times.
[203:47.42]It's so funny, like what a curse, right?
[203:51.20]I have a curse for you, Jeremy.
[203:53.38]From now on, every time you laugh, you like to laugh, don't you?
[203:58.57]You love laughing at things.
[204:01.41]Well, watch what happens now.
[204:20.75]Wait.
[204:22.15]Excuse me.
[204:26.09]Will you make another saw house?
[204:28.88]I will make.
[204:29.52]Yeah, I'm going to make a custom house 100%.
[204:30.98]I just want to see the game.
[204:34.64]I want to play it for the next few days.
[204:37.65]I want to see what it has to offer, you know?
[204:41.91]Cool.
[204:43.09]I have to make this into something.
[204:51.41]You're gonna make your dream saw house.
[204:53.31]Is there actually coins in the fireplace?
[205:13.21]It's kind of funny because I really don't hate this color scheme.
[205:16.15]Uh oh.
[205:22.55]Wait, this is giving me money.
[205:30.58]How much money is that giving me?
[205:32.24]Left you some pizza in the fridge.
[205:34.78]Thank you.
[205:36.28]That's very kind of you.
[205:39.76]I'm not going to eat that.
[205:46.92]What is this?
[205:48.79]Oh, it's like a piece of patchwork.
[206:04.60]Alright, what else isn't anything on the ground?
[206:07.94]Yeah.
[206:11.94]Again, slowly but surely, I'm going to make this place my favorite place.
[206:18.67]I get rid of all this.
[206:19.41]I don't need any of this.
[206:21.11]This fireplace is probably worth a lot.
[206:35.11]Let's do this for a minute because I want.
[206:41.54]Oh yeah, I want to make the walls neutral for now.
[206:45.70]Damage painted wood.
[206:48.52]Glossy painted wood, custom color wood.
[206:53.87]What is that?
[206:54.43]OK, here we go, surface finishes.
[207:08.02]Paint.
[207:10.28]Cool green.
[207:18.52]I'm going to go with like, let's go with, no, not white.
[207:20.46]Maybe like a cyan.
[207:23.08]Let's see.
[207:24.46]How's this look?
[207:49.23]Feeling alright?
[207:51.39]It's okay.
[207:57.09]You're painting over the wallpaper.
[207:59.11]Yep.
[208:00.21]Remember to water the plants.
[208:03.94]Oops.
[208:19.36]Painting over the post-it note on the wall.
[208:27.16]If I take that off, it'd be funny if there's just a yellow, like an orange-yellow square behind it.
[208:36.35]Painting over stains?
[208:39.97]I am... Hold on, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[208:49.08]There.
[208:50.58]There.
[208:50.82]Okay, keep going.
[209:09.93]That shit's gonna peel, man.
[209:11.69]Those plants cannot be saved.
[209:13.72]Probably not.
[209:20.80]Wait, can I?
[209:36.59]Cool.
[209:43.40]Would you ever make a podcast?
[209:45.64]No.
[209:49.04]I'm doing a podcast, essentially, right now.
[209:54.66]If I did a podcast, it would be what you're watching right now.
[209:57.98]Sans video game.
[209:58.92]It would be almost identical.
[210:04.55]Let me get this other wall.
[210:32.92]Dude, Sans is gonna be in a video game?
[210:37.28]Did you hear the first part of that song?
[210:43.32]I love it!
[210:45.02]It's like my favorite song!
[210:57.63]You know what a fun game show would be?
[211:02.35]if you I don't know if it'd be like a segment of a game show but having people need to recognize a song by a half second snippet of the song I think would be kind of fun just like a done like what was that it already exists what's it called I'd love to see it I think that's interesting
[211:32.35]But I'm not, okay, I'm not talking about a full 30 seconds of the song or even 10 seconds of the song, because that's kind of, you know, if you know music, if you know a lot of bands, that's not that hard.
[211:45.41]I'm talking the equivalent of the from Sansong.
[211:59.34]It's called, what is it called?
[212:00.58]Hurdle.
[212:03.49]I'll look it up.
[212:20.77]Ludwig was playing it the other day.
[212:21.95]Really?
[212:23.43]I'll have to check it out.
[212:24.11]They have to guess the song based on one note?
[212:30.74]Is a show like that?
[212:33.11]Now that, I don't know, that would be impossible.
[212:35.71]You're talking about one piano key?
[212:39.67]I don't know.
[212:40.29]How would you, how would you get it?
[212:52.05]Don't you not listen to any music ever?
[212:53.44]How would you play it?
[212:54.08]Um, it's not, not ever.
[213:00.27]I don't really use music for background noise because it distracts me from whatever I'm doing.
[213:05.61]If I'm writing or concentrating on something or music is a part of my brain that just pays attention to the music and does not allow me to pay attention to anything else.
[213:17.74]If I'm going to listen to music, I'm listening to music.
[213:20.02]I'm sitting down putting headphones on and that is what I'm doing.
[213:34.74]I know a lot of people, like, write papers and do work and stuff with music, but it just... It adds extra time to my job I'm doing.
[213:42.49]Just because the amount of time I have to pause for a second and be like, oh, hold on, this... I like this part.
[213:56.18]Oh, I did get perks, right?
[214:00.14]You're the fastest cleaner in Pina Cove.
[214:06.43]I'll take it.
[214:07.95]Roller uses less paint.
[214:08.97]It's very effective.
[214:10.31]Very efficient.
[214:13.40]I say efficient is efficient.
[214:16.34]Where did I just say?
[214:21.06]I have painting.
[214:21.68]Let's see.
[214:22.60]I'm curious.
[214:34.35]Yeah, it is moving.
[214:35.13]It's spreading around.
[214:45.79]It's going faster, it definitely is.
[214:47.41]That's why I use elevator music, because it's all the same and gets me in a brainwashed corporate mindset.
[215:03.04]Jeez.
[215:22.77]Sim City 4 music is really good for that.
[215:35.91]Sim City.
[215:41.36]You definitely listen to like the Muppets.
[215:44.72]Uh.
[215:46.96]I mean.
[215:49.89]Aurora borealis shining down on Dallas.
[215:53.00]Can you picture that?
[216:11.55]You know what's really funny?
[216:13.19]I know that, like, the meme, Jerma's a cartoon character, right?
[216:18.31]I know, I've seen it all.
[216:20.74]But it is kind of funny that I genuinely do think that Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem is one of the best, my favorite bands.
[216:29.42]I think they have, like, great music.
[216:45.42]They've got some real bangers.
[216:48.30]They're very, very good.
[216:57.11]The who and the what?
[216:57.87]Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.
[217:09.06]It's a band in the Muppets.
[217:19.05]I just like Dr. Teeth a lot.
[217:21.17]Dr. Teeth is one of my favorite Muppets.
[217:23.47]He might even be my favorite Muppet.
[217:26.91]I love the way, I just love the way he talks.
[217:28.36]I love that like, well, excuse me, let me say something really I do say.
[217:35.40]It's kind of like that Goku.
[217:37.48]I love that.
[217:38.16]I love that kind of style of character.
[217:52.25]Brown ass man loves the Muppets.
[218:07.27]Can you picture you gotta see it in your mind?
[218:11.82]Can you picture it's easy and hard to?
[218:15.04]It's not hard to find.
[218:19.21]Can you picture that?
[218:21.23]Can you picture that?
[218:28.96]Hey Floyd, take a verse!
[218:32.20]Just go listen to Can You Picture That right now.
[218:35.22]Just do it right now.
[218:39.17]They've performed that song live.
[218:42.52]Weren't they at... Okay, am I misremembering this?
[218:46.34]Or was Dr. Teeth and Electric Mayhem one of the bands that performed at Coachella a few years ago?
[218:55.61]That's real, right?
[218:56.37]They actually did that, didn't they?
[219:01.11]What was it?
[219:04.93]You're off your rocker right now.
[219:06.35]I swear to God, they were at some major music festival.
[219:12.68]You won guide yourself.
[219:13.72]No, I, I, I think that's accurate.
[219:15.86]Let me see.
[219:18.42]I really think that's, that's a real thing.
[219:25.53]Dr. Teeth live.
[219:28.61]Okay.
[219:33.70]They've, they've been at the lands lands concert, 2016.
[219:39.19]They've been... Uh... No, they've definitely been somewhere else.
[219:47.45]They've been a lot of places.
[219:52.16]Dr. Teeth, live.
[219:53.62]I'm going to write Coachella.
[220:01.10]Lance Concert 2016, I think is what it was.
[220:08.73]Muppets at Coachella.
[220:12.29]This is a Reddit thread.
[220:12.97]I'm pretty sure Dr. Teeth and Electric Mayhem played Outside Lands a few years back.
[220:17.29]Huh.
[220:22.22]That's not a Muppet festival.
[220:23.96]Well, it wasn't Coachella, but it was like a big music festival.
[220:30.00]I'm sure you guys will find it.
[220:34.60]The Wiggles are at a lot of concerts too.
[220:38.72]The Wiggles perform at Coachella.
[220:41.74]You gotta shake.
[220:42.88]You gotta shake.
[220:43.98]You gotta shake your hips when you get out of bed.
[220:46.50]Move around.
[220:47.04]Alright, I think I'm gonna wrap it up here.
[221:02.37]I think I'd be a great Wiggle.
[221:07.31]Alternate universe?
[221:09.29]I think it'd be a pretty good wiggle.
[221:15.15]I would do one show though, get exhausted, hate it, and never do it again.
[221:20.11]And I would have them like kill me off or something.
[221:24.41]Like canonically kill me.
[221:32.30]Introducing the new performer!
[221:35.99]Hey everybody, it's me!
[221:39.77]Oh, sorry.
[221:41.09]He didn't want to do it anymore.
[221:43.11]We have to canonically kill Jerma.
[221:45.82]As the new fucking children's performer.
[221:47.80]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[221:53.26]Tomorrow morning, 10am.
[221:54.96]Same time.
[221:56.06]We're gonna go three days in a row, so...
[221:58.78]This will be five streams in a row.
[222:01.96]I mean, the first one was like 30 minutes, but still.
[222:05.04]Thank you, House Flipper Devs, for the sponsor.
[222:08.04]Again, very important.
[222:09.98]The big community event going on right now for the next month, month and a half almost.
[222:14.90]Big contest for you to win a bunch of different things if you win.
[222:19.07]Grand prize is a really, really cool looking custom computer.
[222:24.23]It's got a bunch of crazy stuff in it.
[222:26.17]The case looks amazing.
[222:27.27]HowSlipper2.com slash contest.
[222:30.82]Check it out.
[222:31.20]It's out right now on Steam.
[222:33.56]Just came out literally yesterday.
[222:34.90]You saw the event last night, but it's very fun.
[222:40.44]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[222:42.40]Take care of yourselves.
[222:43.84]I will see you bright and early at 10 a.m.
[222:46.10]Pacific.
[222:47.40]We will continue.
[222:49.98]I imagine I probably do each each day something different.
[222:53.10]So maybe tomorrow I'll do try to unlock more of the assembly stuff, more of the actual custom house stuff.
[223:00.58]We'll try to see as much as we can in the next like three days.
[223:06.10]Yeah, see you soon.
[223:07.00]Thanks again, House Flipper Devs.
[223:09.01]Appreciate it.
[223:11.25]Go check it out.
[223:12.25]See you soon and take care.
[223:20.88]Have fun at the nursing home.
[223:23.16]Thank you.
[223:30.03]You should make a wiggle house.
[223:34.63]And then green screen myself.
[223:38.53]And take that gray shirt I had on and key like a certain primary color on it.
[223:44.52]And just maybe dance around the house.
[224:00.99]When's Nancy Drew gonna come back?
[224:03.41]That... Okay, House Slipper is one of my favorite games.
[224:07.11]Because it's a great game to sit here and just talk and chill.
[224:11.49]Some of my favorite times I've ever turned on this stream.
[224:14.93]You might think it's Dollhouse.
[224:16.03]You might think it's like the baseball stream or like some major event.
[224:18.61]I love those.
[224:19.39]They're so great.
[224:20.07]And they're up there at in like S plus tier.
[224:23.29]But also stuff like this is there too.
[224:25.89]I like just kind of hanging out and just talking.
[224:28.65]Not needing to worry about like, oh my God, I got to fucking be wicked good at this game.
[224:32.45]It's fun just to kind of hang out and chill and talk.
[224:33.97]I love it.
[224:35.61]So, it's the perfect game to do it.
[224:38.97]And Nancy Drew is also like that too.
[224:40.91]I mean, yeah, there's like puzzles and stuff, but there's a lot of downtime.
[224:46.40]You'll see it again.
[224:52.86]What's your favorite Muppet movie?
[224:55.84]In no particular order, the first one, the original Muppet movie, Muppets from Space, and probably Muppet Christmas Carol.
[225:10.30]Yeah, Muppet Treasure Island is very close too, though.
[225:19.56]I just like the bear in Muppets from Space.
[225:25.77]Oh, yes, General.
[225:26.79]Oh, yeah.
[225:27.97]Okay.
[225:29.63]Are we seeing a theme here?
[225:32.11]I love characters that kind of talk like this.
[225:36.00]General, here's our new retinal scanner.
[225:43.29]We're off the dog.
[225:44.03]Yep.
[225:52.98]You should raid Ster.
[225:55.54]Ster's streaming.
[225:55.98]Ster's live now?
[225:56.64]Oh, it is like 2 o'clock, yeah.
[225:59.80]Yeah, we'll raid Ster.
[226:02.71]Go say congratulations, Ster.
[226:07.65]Well, he was... No, he knew.
[226:10.45]What is he doing?
[226:12.85]What's Ster up to today?
[226:13.68]He's playing the finals.
[226:24.93]Well, don't annoy him.
[226:29.79]Yeah, don't annoy Ster.
[226:31.65]Because when I raid Ster, it's just like, sometimes he DMs me and he's like, hey, that was annoying.
[226:44.70]I'm kidding.
[226:45.34]It's never happened.
[226:46.22]Alright.
[226:46.46]Say hi to Ster.
[226:47.06]Be good.
[226:50.70]Tell him that his house slipper house was hysterical.
[227:09.18]Yeah, take care.
[227:10.30]See you soon.
[227:11.86]Have a great rest of your day.
[227:13.70]I mean, it's actually kind of weird to be like, hey, have a good night.
[227:16.46]No, it's daytime.
[227:23.74]Yeah, take care.
[227:25.70]What about the sorcery messages?
[227:28.78]Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
[227:30.22]We have to finish it.
[227:31.10]We're like right at the finish line, I know.
[227:35.02]It's in the brain, it is.
[227:40.05]Alright, take it easy, guys.
[227:40.71]Have a good rest of your day.
[227:41.57]See you guys tomorrow, 10 a.m.
[227:43.30]More Health Flipper.
[227:46.59]Have a great day.
