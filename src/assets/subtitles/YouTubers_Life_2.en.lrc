[00:03.50]I'm on time.
[00:04.04]What are you talking about?
[00:06.82]A lot of you guys just sit here and wait till 2.01.
[00:11.00]Just start spamming me.
[00:12.32]How you doing?
[00:14.52]What's up?
[00:17.20]This isn't movie night.
[00:18.40]No, that's... That's next weekend.
[00:22.98]I'm gonna give you the schedule.
[00:23.80]Just hold on.
[00:28.74]How are my balls doing?
[00:30.96]Weird question to start with, but they're doing alright.
[00:36.92]No spooky games this Halloween.
[00:39.74]Well, we're gonna change it up this year.
[00:42.48]Instead of playing spooky games around Halloween time, we're gonna watch horror public domain movies.
[00:50.99]We're gonna watch old scary movies from like 1950, 1930.
[00:57.05]That's what Public Domain Movie Night 2 is all about.
[01:04.67]That stream, give you a little bit of time to prepare for that in case you don't want to miss it.
[01:10.81]It's gonna be the 30th.
[01:14.43]Not streaming on Halloween this year.
[01:18.44]For the first time in probably, it's been a long time.
[01:24.40]I'm streaming the day before Halloween.
[01:27.66]Not streaming on Halloween night.
[01:32.70]Need to go trick-or-treating.
[01:33.74]That's right.
[01:37.71]And I don't go back in until my pillowcase is full.
[01:45.35]See the people walking around with the little buckets that can hold like 12 pieces of candy?
[01:50.69]Ah, excuse me.
[01:52.83]No, no, you walk around...
[01:55.55]Like the guy that has a stick with the knapsack on it.
[01:59.69]You just walk around until you fill the whole bag.
[02:09.33]You get only coal, you weirdo.
[02:11.23]This is not Christmas.
[02:12.23]Imagine somebody opened the door, you're like, oh, trick or treat.
[02:16.97]And they opened the door, they had fucking like a Christmas hat on.
[02:23.99]The guy comes out and he's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, olé, kids.
[02:27.97]Oh, hey, Mr. Stevenson.
[02:29.53]How are you?
[02:30.17]Are these your kids?
[02:31.61]And you see this guy just drops coal in all the kids' bags.
[02:36.58]Oh, this is not for you.
[02:38.10]This is for your dad over there.
[02:40.64]Keeps letting the dog shit on the lawn.
[02:43.78]You go give that to him.
[02:44.86]Alright, give me one second.
[02:48.67]I'll be right back.
[02:50.27]Starting soon.

[02:57.05]I'll be right back.
[05:03.31]I swear to God.
[05:04.63]Some of you guys just don't know.
[05:06.45]But I'll tell you.
[05:09.21]It's like, before every stream, it's like the intro to Home Alone in here.
[05:14.24]I'm running all over the place.
[05:15.58]Trying to find everything.
[05:19.86]Like, the channel's live and I'm looking for my phone.

[11:51.89]Eyes.
[11:54.79]Where's my slate blue eyes?
[11:56.79]They don't have them.
[12:01.02]You're a 10-year-old.
[12:10.06]This is a Pokémon character creator?
[12:11.76]What would you guys say is more like my eyes?
[12:14.73]I think it's these ones.
[12:18.96]Alright, facial features?
[12:19.92]Oh, I thought these were big, thick eyebrows.
[12:27.42]A lightning bolt.
[12:30.72]Is it a big scar?
[12:31.68]No, I don't... Is there facial hair?
[12:37.34]What about mouth?
[12:42.83]What's the difference?
[12:46.47]Oh, I have a big mouth.
[12:58.62]Oh, man.
[12:59.26]I like this one because it's just so... It's so weird looking.
[13:08.07]It doesn't... It just looks wrong.
[13:09.09]It just looks odd.
[13:10.47]Alright, hairstyle.
[13:18.40]This looks like those Funko Pops.
[13:27.87]The unedited Andy.
[13:30.61]What are you talking about?
[13:35.16]Unedited Andy.
[13:36.86]Why are you saying unedited Andy?
[13:39.18]That's a really fun word to say though out loud.
[13:40.86]Say it out loud.
[13:41.54]Close your eyes and just say unedited.
[13:45.04]Unedited.
[13:45.48]There's a lot of like D's and E's and the consonants bounce.
[13:50.70]Unedited.
[13:51.69]Unedited.
[13:56.60]You want us to go with the default?
[13:57.42]We're going with this one.
[14:07.79]It's too much fucking work to have here.
[14:09.23]It just is.
[14:09.89]Alright.
[14:11.59]Let me be really honest.
[14:12.35]Hold on a minute.
[14:12.99]Let me just clear my throat.
[14:14.57]Here comes the boomer take.
[14:15.69]It's too much work to do here like this.
[14:17.71]You should just have it be flopping over on the side.
[14:23.00]Oh, but really, this takes like an hour to do this.
[14:25.68]It's too much.
[14:30.95]That's fine, whatever.
[14:34.59]I want cool glasses.
[14:39.90]No, not really.
[14:43.92]No, not really.
[14:46.30]No.
[14:47.62]Actually, maybe.
[14:54.56]I kind of want this.
[14:57.32]I'm going to keep it.
[15:01.15]A for Andy.
[15:02.73]Stop saying Andy.
[15:03.97]Just because I say it like once every few weeks doesn't mean everything has to be Andy.
[15:10.92]Headphones?
[15:14.04]No, I don't.
[15:15.26]No.
[15:17.89]No, no.
[15:19.39]Have fun wearing this and then have your ears hurt.
[15:22.09]It's painful to fucking touch them.
[15:24.87]This is great, though.
[15:26.27]Let's have huge headphones.
[15:27.39]I don't know why that became a thing.
[15:29.53]You wear these things for more than an hour and you'll take them off and it's like, ow!
[15:35.92]And if your hair touches your ears, it's like, fuck, that hurts.
[15:38.94]I don't understand these.
[15:46.51]That's true.
[15:47.01]I saw at least two trues.
[15:48.11]Thank you.
[15:48.35]I don't want to wear those.
[15:54.54]Guys, don't you understand?
[15:55.22]As long as one person says true in the chat, I am correct.
[16:04.92]See, this is nothing I would ever put on.
[16:10.31]Let me give you some advice.
[16:11.93]Well, this is not advice.
[16:12.69]You're probably going to think I'm a weirdo.
[16:15.14]A button-up shirt, like this.
[16:18.66]You don't wear that to, like, go get coffee at Starbucks.
[16:21.56]I wouldn't.
[16:23.52]The amount of time it takes to button those four buttons is too much time for me to go get, like, a coffee.
[16:31.50]Now, if there was, like, an event I was going to, or if it was, like, a work thing or something, yeah.
[16:36.52]That's just too much.
[16:37.42]It's too much time.
[16:38.03]Maybe I'm just a weirdo.
[16:43.09]Which, I mean, maybe I am.
[16:49.68]There we go.
[16:50.04]Not too much time.
[16:50.69]Just a jacket.
[16:54.59]It's a little weird.
[16:55.85]Just put the seashells on.
[16:59.49]No, that's too wacky.
[17:01.31]That's way too wacky.
[17:03.49]Do they just have like a Pac-Man t-shirt?
[17:08.85]With wicked stained underarms.
[17:11.40]Like stained yellow underarms.
[17:13.36]Just a white t-shirt with stained underarms.
[17:14.96]Where is that?
[17:16.96]This will do.
[17:30.62]Alright, I don't like it.
[17:31.40]I like a bathing suit.
[17:38.53]I wear jeans, I do.
[17:39.99]I wear jeans or shorts.
[17:43.97]Yeah, that's pretty.
[17:44.61]Nah.
[17:47.53]That's almost two put together.
[17:48.59]You know what I mean?
[17:53.96]Like the white tee and the jeans is almost like you're doing that on purpose.
[17:56.80]It's two put together.
[18:01.85]There we go.
[18:02.91]Alright, that looks good.
[18:10.59]What's wrong with nothing?
[18:11.29]Just put an X. Wait, what?
[18:16.44]Oh my god, you can.
[18:19.26]Wait.
[18:20.34]You can, right?
[18:22.14]I mean, I... Why would you be... I'm not gonna walk around like this.
[18:27.92]This... Alright.
[18:28.32]Alright.
[18:30.03]This is my actual real attire every day.
[18:34.64]I swear to God, it's what I currently have pretty much on right now.
[18:39.94]This is just how I live every day in my privacy of my own place.
[18:46.24]If I was to make a video on YouTube, this would be my outfit.
[18:48.94]That's what I would be wearing right now.
[18:51.04]I wouldn't wear the sneakers though.
[18:53.64]It'd be big, big white tube socks like your dad wears.
[18:57.42]I don't wear those either.
[18:58.04]They cut off circulation in my legs.
[18:59.10]That's a lie.
[19:01.00]I don't believe that.
[19:05.38]Yeah, this is it.
[19:06.30]This is literally what I wear every day.
[19:09.76]I'm starting to become more aware of this now.
[19:12.57]But yeah, just flip-flops, a pair of shorts, and nothing.
[19:20.07]This is what I wear every day.
[19:21.37]But the sunglasses aren't accurate, but we're doing that for fun.
[19:29.23]It's very beachy, isn't it?
[19:33.60]Why don't I live on a beach or something?
[19:37.12]I don't want to do that.
[19:40.08]My attire every day is like, you should be in, like, the tropics.
[19:50.35]Okay.
[19:51.77]New tube.
[19:53.43]Do I have to, like, sign up or sign in or something?
[19:59.38]Oh, that's my contact.
[20:00.82]That's the zoom hacker.
[20:05.42]Welcome to New Tube City.
[20:06.45]This is your new home from now on.
[20:09.09]That sounds real.
[20:09.67]I don't like the way you worded that.
[20:12.15]That seems strange, the way to say that.
[20:14.51]How about like, welcome to New Tube City.
[20:16.23]Welcome home.
[20:17.49]From now on?
[20:18.63]What if I want to leave?
[20:19.36]It isn't very big inside, but don't worry.
[20:23.02]Later on, you'll be able to decorate and upgrade it as you like.
[20:27.38]Why do I look like I'm going to assault this guy?
[20:30.50]My fist is clenched.
[20:31.38]I'm going to punch him in the face.
[20:33.32]Now go inside.
[20:34.04]I've left you a present.
[20:35.38]I've got to go.
[20:35.98]We'll talk later.
[20:38.93]I'm clenched fished.
[20:40.19]I'm ready to hurt this guy.
[20:41.39]I'm ready to punch him.
[20:48.25]Dermot, release your nudes when you retire.
[20:53.60]What, like that's the last thing I do before I'm done streaming?
[20:58.49]Oh, you know what?
[21:00.17]Guys, here's every selfie I've ever taken on my phone.
[21:03.73]It's like 700 images.
[21:06.05]Some of them are naked.
[21:06.61]I don't even care.
[21:11.19]I don't take pictures.
[21:12.21]Alright, what do we got?
[21:17.57]What's this?
[21:17.83]Is it like a VR helmet?
[21:20.71]Oh.
[21:23.57]Starting up.
[21:27.22]No, this is inaccurate.
[21:28.88]I gotta get this accurate.
[21:30.32]Everybody here has a YouTuber voice, even the robots.
[21:33.20]But I have to make sure I get that right.
[21:34.30]Let me make sure I get this correct.
[21:41.76]Okay.
[21:43.40]Maybe not.
[21:44.04]Here we go.
[21:45.48]Okay.
[21:46.06]How does that sound?
[21:48.36]That sounds pretty good.
[21:49.68]Okay.
[21:52.84]Hi, I'm a drone camp.

[22:32.30]Rubble 100.
[22:32.64]No, I don't like any of these.
[22:36.06]We'll make our own.
[22:47.72]Uh... I don't know.

[23:15.46]Alright, that's fine.
[23:20.12]DroneculaTube?
[23:20.74]I love it.
[23:22.98]Beep beep.
[23:30.71]It's lovely to meet you.
[23:32.03]I'll be here to record you and help you whenever you need me.
[23:35.87]First step, learn how to record videos.
[23:39.43]But before you do, you need to create your YouTube channel, the platform where the best content creators post their videos.
[23:45.99]People of mine is doing this a lot.
[23:47.27]Does this sound bad?
[23:48.34]Did I fuck it up?
[23:55.44]This voice sucks and the thing sucks.
[23:57.22]Oh.
[23:58.38]Oh, the name.
[23:59.06]Okay.
[24:01.54]Alright, this is new too.
[24:05.62]Your name.
[24:06.86]Jerma.
[24:08.64]Pick a name, choose wisely.
[24:11.76]But I can... Insert your channel name.
[24:17.56]Okay, hold on.
[24:18.32]Alright, your channel.
[24:23.66]Does it have to be like a dot com?
[24:25.45]Or like a YouTube?
[24:26.73]You know what I mean?
[24:27.87]Like, oh, is this my channel name?
[24:30.19]This is important.
[24:35.13]Ryder, 985.
[24:36.17]Caesar, 985.

[25:57.96]Yes, I'm intrigued.
[26:00.76]This is a recording point for you to record videos.
[26:02.74]You can find points like this one around the city.
[26:04.78]I can do IRL videos.
[26:08.34]Okay.
[26:09.50]Use the recording point to record your first introductory vlog for the channel.
[26:14.53]You don't start with a vlog.
[26:17.87]I'll record you.
[26:18.69]Okay.
[26:19.87]Record your first vlog.

[26:35.27]This is dead air.
[26:35.89]Am I recording?
[26:36.71]Am I- New subscribers.
[26:49.22]How do I record?
[26:54.31]said anything actually you know what this probably get a lot of views because it's fucking weird how do I do anything home vlog which camera this one oh okay you start recording and you shyly say hello you're full of energy
[27:20.54]hey what's going on everybody you go on and on and then you let out a what the fuck you flatter yourself oh you make a bad joke you let out a what WTF you pout and you're in chill mode drone killer tube is losing battery you ask for subscribers wait my camera's out of battery I beg for subscribers
[27:53.65]Okay.
[27:55.03]Here are my clips.
[27:55.83]Can I watch them?
[28:04.80]Activate chill mode.
[28:06.06]Okay.
[28:10.30]This is a normie Jerma?
[28:13.28]Well, you didn't say that.
[28:13.92]You said normal.
[28:16.20]Beep beep.
[28:17.39]Nice acting, David.
[28:18.43]What do you mean acting?
[28:19.61]Wasn't it a vlog?
[28:20.19]Okay.
[28:26.16]Who's acting on a vlog?
[28:27.62]First, we'll touch it up a bit by editing on your computer.
[28:38.24]What if I don't want to... This is not how this works.
[28:42.43]I have to make like 30 of these in a row before I decide which one I actually want to use.
[28:45.91]Okay, vlog.
[28:52.33]Recording, trends, okay, vlog.
[28:57.13]This tool is the video editor.
[28:58.15]You can use it to edit your videos and finish giving them your personal touch.
[29:02.71]Okay.
[29:03.29]The goal is to get as many points as possible.
[29:05.18]Make sure the clips connect to each other well.
[29:07.38]Oh, I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up.
[29:08.90]If you manage to connect them from the start to the end of the video, you'll get a juicy bonus.
[29:14.58]Later, when you have a better PC with more rendering points, you'll be able to buy video effects and use them in your clips to boost your edits even more.
[29:23.65]And now I'll let the creative genius unleash his imagination.
[29:25.69]Alright.
[29:27.52]I don't even know what the context of these clips even is.
[29:29.34]Can I, like, see this?
[29:39.06]Oh, they have, like, connecting points.
[29:40.89]This is so stupid.
[29:45.03]Um, okay.
[29:45.93]This is just, like, a puzzle.
[29:51.93]I need a connector here.
[29:56.35]I can't- editing videos is hard.
[29:58.38]What do I start with?
[29:59.44]This one.
[30:04.12]What the fuck?
[30:05.92]It's the pipe game.
[30:16.99]I don't think I can even connect these.
[30:18.29]Can I?
[30:18.57]Do I have enough pieces to do this?
[30:21.35]I don't think I have enough pieces to do this.
[30:24.79]Who cares?
[30:26.65]Just go in order.
[30:37.88]That doesn't work.
[30:43.20]I don't care.
[30:43.60]I don't think you can do it.
[30:46.88]Choose the video's thumbnail.
[30:48.04]They're all the same.
[30:48.88]Everything's the same video.
[30:54.59]Bad video.
[30:56.43]Choose clickbait phrase.
[31:03.14]If this is accurate.
[31:22.15]If this is accurate, this person has no idea what they're doing.
[31:25.87]Okay, that looks good.
[31:30.61].webm.
[31:33.40]I can't add anything to it.
[31:34.60]That's fine.
[31:37.32]I like this title.
[31:38.06]Why can't I publish video?
[31:39.02]Yeah, let's go.
[31:42.48]Include the date stamp.
[31:43.54]Oh shit, that's right.

[32:09.75]Your goal, gain loads of subscribers.
[32:14.10]Okay, check out the NewTube app.
[32:16.30]F.
[32:20.44]My profile.

[32:23.06]NewTube.
[32:25.71]Your latest videos.
[32:26.79]My ranking.
[32:28.39]One video published.
[32:29.35]Three likes.
[32:30.19]It was me.
[32:32.59]At least one of those is me.
[32:38.00]You guys have to understand something.
[32:39.76]When you're starting out, I remember like 10 plus years ago, I remember the proportion of likes to dislikes were... When you have three or four likes and even one or two dislikes, that's a potential 50% ratio.
[32:58.04]One dislike here is world changing.
[33:01.24]I remember when that used to happen.
[33:03.37]I would have a video go up and it would be like 30, 40 likes and there would be like two or three dislikes and I'd be like, that's fucking world ending.
[33:10.09]That's such a huge percentage.
[33:18.98]Zero views?
[33:19.76]Where do you see zero views?
[33:21.78]Oh shit, there's no views.
[33:26.60]Okay, let's go back.
[33:31.10]Alright, so I have this my cats are trending deity of war Honey play studios one and adventure games.
[33:38.81]Alright, we need to have a cat in the video Alright Okay Did you know that I can also record commentary scripts on the computer Scripts are a type of video.
[33:55.07]I don't know how to record without them.
[33:57.11]Xavier says there's a load of them hidden around the city.
[33:59.23]I
[34:00.40]Do I have to go plagiarize people?
[34:02.37]Every time you record with a script, you improve its quality, and this is how you get better clips and scores.
[34:08.07]Shall we try a commentary video to see if you get the first 30 subscribers to your channel?
[34:11.63]Okay.
[34:14.19]Do I have to just go around and take steel scripts from trash cans?
[34:20.26]Alright, let's go.
[34:22.08]30 subs.
[34:22.58]I think I can do it.
[34:25.90]Commentary.
[34:31.37]go why am I like using mind like powers to start the video shyly say hello a poltergeist appears and a poltergeist appears where you have a laughing fit that's what I would do you go on and on and then a
[34:57.44]Let's get into chill mode here again.
[34:58.62]I don't know, somebody likes this.
[35:02.92]And it's over.
[35:04.66]You ask for subscribers and it's over.
[35:07.32]Alright, we're gonna just sign off.
[35:08.42]Here we go.
[35:15.78]Alright.
[35:20.88]Save?
[35:21.20]Remember that you need to edit and post the video on the computer.
[35:27.10]Here's a commentary.
[35:27.68]Oh, fuck.
[35:27.96]People are going to think I'm so stupid.
[35:30.70]I'm not supposed to go in order.
[35:31.94]Okay, so this one has the down, down.
[35:38.89]I can't connect these.
[35:39.73]There's no way I can possibly connect all these.
[35:49.88]Just go in order.
[35:51.08]There's no, what do you mean?
[35:53.59]You're not supposed to connect all of them.
[35:56.37]Oh.
[35:57.05]Okay.
[35:59.70]Does that get double points?
[36:03.26]Get as many connections as possible and not just put them all on there.
[36:06.20]Okay.
[36:11.38]Hold on.
[36:11.68]Can I get more like this?
[36:12.52]Now it has to start with this because it's red.
[36:24.58]Alright, there you go.
[36:25.52]Well, how's this worse editing?
[36:26.40]1, 2, 3, 4.
[36:28.58]There's 1, 1, 1, 2!
[36:28.82]There's no 1, 2, 3, 4!
[36:29.48]It's 1, 1, 1, 2!
[36:29.96]What do you see?
[36:30.60]1, 2, 3, 4!
[36:30.96]1, 1, 1, 2!
[36:31.04]Oh, that's 14! 14!
[36:54.88]You have to get to the 10 minute mark so you get the post roll.
[36:58.52]No, I had it right the first time.
[37:01.78]See?
[37:02.82]That's good.
[37:03.62]That's good enough.
[37:04.16]Publish the stup- This is a video where I'm sitting naked just fucking saying hi to people.
[37:12.75]This one is 30 points.
[37:14.07]I try- I connected the three and it was like 20.
[37:17.05]I can- What?
[37:21.41]Best kept YouTuber secret.
[37:22.67]By adding effects to your clips, you can make your video to the stratosphere.
[37:27.75]It says render points, but you'll have to update the editor and buy them first.
[37:31.01]Oh.
[37:33.13]I only have 100 render points.
[37:38.57]I can't do anything about this.
[37:42.75]Alright.
[37:43.79]Let me just see what happens if I do this.
[37:44.81]18.
[37:44.83]Nope.
[37:50.39]See?
[37:51.63]The other one was better.
[37:56.02]See?
[37:56.78]I know what I'm doing.
[37:57.26]If you're a washed-up YouTuber, you're never gonna hit it big.
[38:12.05]No.
[38:13.11]Probably not anymore.
[38:15.77]If I started those TF2 videos now,
[38:19.02]People would just think I was a fucking moron.
[38:24.60]I sure did luck out on that one.
[38:26.28]Alright, title.
[38:29.92]No, my video.
[38:31.04]Excuse me.
[38:31.98]I think my videos were very interesting.
[38:33.56]They had interesting topics.
[38:35.91]Don't get me wrong.
[38:36.71]I love all my videos.
[38:37.53]They're all my children.
[38:38.27]Alright, title.
[38:54.40]Who cares?
[38:56.74]This is how you make the best commentary with hashtag home.
[39:01.20]Do I play like the metadata?
[39:02.59]Should I put hashtag cats?
[39:04.35]But no, this stuff never works.
[39:07.61]If you put hashtag cats in here and it's a trending topic, people come to the channel and they say there's no cat here.
[39:13.54]This guy's a dick.
[39:14.76]I hate this guy.
[39:15.76]I say make people hate you.
[39:27.47]I was like, oh man, you gotta make sure your, like, tags are really, like, really pull viewers and shit.
[39:32.68]So I just lie to people and everyone just hates me after, like, a month?
[39:36.44]Why would I do that?
[39:41.21]That was better than the last one.
[39:48.58]I got subs!
[39:50.16]Holy shit, 30 scripted video game subscribers that give them to you in the very beginning to go through the tutorial to make sure you get to over 100.
[39:57.81]Ring.
[39:59.89]It's already midnight.
[40:00.81]It's time to go to bed.
[40:02.17]Sleeping helps you get back your energy and progress to the next day.
[40:05.25]You can stay awake until 4am, but you won't be able to get all your energy back for the next day.
[40:11.90]Good night, David.
[40:13.26]I'll call you tomorrow morning to tell you something important.
[40:15.36]Don't call me anymore, Xavier.
[40:17.34]In fact, I'm changing, like, literally, I'm changing my name.
[40:21.43]I'm changing everything about my life.
[40:22.71]I don't like this guy.
[40:24.63]He's scary.
[40:30.27]Let's go to bed.
[40:36.67]Ooh.
[40:39.65]I thought I was in a bathtub for a second.
[40:42.81]Maybe... Sleeping with the sandals on?
[40:48.87]Yeah, that's weird.
[40:54.67]Seems today is going to be a good day.
[40:55.75]Luck is on your side.
[40:56.51]Young YouTuber.
[40:57.47]What am I, a fucking Padawan?
[41:00.87]Okay.
[41:01.63]I need to do a video about armored nucleus.
[41:04.13]Okay.
[41:11.88]Hey, David, I just saw the videos you uploaded to your channel.
[41:14.40]They're good, but you might have noticed that they haven't gotten many visits.
[41:17.82]That's because they aren't good.
[41:19.38]I'm lying to you.
[41:20.32]I'm a manager agent person that just roped you into this and is scamming you and is going to take 40% of all of your money.
[41:29.09]Check the daily trends to record and upload a video on them.
[41:31.47]You'll get more visits and subs.
[41:38.46]Check the trends on my phone.
[41:41.95]Okay.
[41:42.95]Here's my quests.
[41:43.83]Pay attention to what's currently trending in the city.
[41:50.50]They are split according to popularity into unknown, normal, well-known, very, they're, it's, they're loot.
[41:57.24]It's loot colors.
[41:59.08]So this is, okay, this is high profile.
[42:03.81]Oh my god.
[42:07.13]Now, the deity of war game is pretty popular, but when you see any high profile or trending topic, you gotta go for it.
[42:17.14]This type of mentality to me is just like the ambulance chaser of like the lawyer world.
[42:21.48]No, like, I don't... Just make videos on what you want to make videos on.
[42:24.52]Like if I wake up in the morning and I see that like cats are trending on fucking YouTube...
[42:32.57]I'm not gonna rip out of the covers, scramble to get out of bed, and freak out to make a cats video.
[42:37.36]Like, just do what you feel like doing.
[42:40.54]Make the videos, make the stuff that you like to do.
[42:42.72]I don't like this.
[42:44.08]Don't listen to this.
[42:48.30]Popular trends in your content is the key to your videos getting lots of views and subscribers.
[42:56.20]This is why you aren't successful.
[42:59.50]Okay.
[43:00.98]This guy.
[43:02.32]This guy over here.
[43:05.29]Okay.
[43:06.29]Well.
[43:09.59]Six or seven million subscribers across all the platforms.
[43:11.61]I mean.
[43:14.33]It's like seven or eight million subscribers, followers.
[43:16.43]I mean, not.
[43:18.33]Excuse me.
[43:23.94]It's definitely like not even a million, by the way.
[43:27.76]I think it's like two million total.
[43:32.54]arrogant have you seen that highest trending videos are about video games to record these kinds of videos you need to install a gaming corner in your home why remember you're a shadowy elite
[43:58.10]What did this person say I need to read?
[43:59.60]Arrogant prick, fuck you.
[44:00.54]We all hate you and watch you to make fun of you behind your back.
[44:08.28]Well, is it behind my back when you're all here doing it now?
[44:16.83]Oh, I'm aware.
[44:17.29]Alright, I need a gaming corner.
[44:23.53]Okay, add furniture.
[44:25.19]Add new workspace.
[44:26.19]Gaming corner.
[44:30.87]Where should I put this?
[44:34.83]Over here?
[44:35.13]In the corner?
[44:39.35]I mean, it says gaming corner.
[44:41.53]I feel like it'd have to be in a corner.
[44:47.52]Perfect.
[44:47.78]Now you've set up your gaming corner.
[44:48.96]Now all you need to do is game and a console and you'll be able to start recording gaming videos.
[44:52.74]Alright.
[44:55.03]Many YouTubers post gaming content trying to find the most popular video games.
[44:59.55]By the way, I've ordered you a game and a console so you can start.
[45:02.33]Go speak- Why did you buy me things?
[45:03.97]Go speak to Blair, the girl in the Player One video game store.
[45:06.94]She'll give them to you.
[45:09.64]I think this actually is something- Playing the popular games on Twitch and YouTube is almost a guaranteed way to not get very much attention.
[45:21.22]Like if I were to start playing a game that's in like the top 10 right now, there's potentially thousands and thousands and thousands of people doing that too.
[45:28.61]It doesn't matter how much it's trending.
[45:33.07]It's hard to stand out when you play the most popular video games.
[45:40.95]Because if I were to start streaming right now, let's say, I don't know, what's like a really popular game right now?
[45:45.24]I don't know, like League of Legends or something, right?
[45:49.59]If I were to start doing that now, there are probably thousands of other people all in the same boat doing the same thing.
[45:57.78]It's harder to stand out when you play, like, the popular trending topics.
[46:05.54]Yeah, but nobody's looking for YouTuber's Life 2 content.
[46:09.10]Hey, you figured me out.
[46:12.14]You figured out the secret recipe.
[46:15.45]Play shit that nobody likes.
[46:21.99]Check the map app if you don't want to get lost.
[46:23.75]Beep, beep.
[46:28.79]Alright, install.
[46:29.31]I have to go talk to this person.
[46:32.10]Play Dragon Rampa.
[46:33.74]No.
[46:35.06]I don't know what that is.
[46:36.14]People keep asking me to do that.
[46:37.12]Alright, so I gotta go get the console.
[46:45.92]Okay, and that is... Oh, my vlog got three coins.
[46:50.77]Alright, the Player 1 video game store.
[46:52.39]Where is that?
[46:56.21]NetFlow.
[46:56.87]Are these all aspiring YouTubers?
[47:00.35]Can I talk?
[47:04.71]Restaurant.
[47:09.24]Oh, okay.
[47:10.44]Do I have a map?
[47:17.10]Alright, we need to go to Player 1.
[47:20.18]Alright, it's right there.
[47:20.88]There's my house.
[47:21.50]It's literally right across the goddamn street.
[47:23.08]Okay.
[47:26.71]No, I'm kidding.
[47:27.71]I play the things I think are fun.
[47:29.51]You guys have seen me play popular games on this channel for like a decade.
[47:32.89]Don't listen to anything I say.
[47:34.47]It's all horseshit.
[47:43.20]Player one.
[47:48.49]Should I play Smite?
[47:49.53]If you want to play it, and you think it's fun.
[47:51.23]Alright, so I'm picking up my console.
[47:54.37]This weird guy that just flew me out here ordered for me.
[47:57.08]Okay, League of Stars.
[48:05.58]Where do I pick it up?
[48:06.10]Talk to Blair.
[48:07.92]Is this Blair?
[48:11.03]Where's Blair?
[48:11.51]This is Deity of War.
[48:16.71]It's Dixie.
[48:19.49]Behind the counter?
[48:20.51]Oh, okay.
[48:21.27]Hi.
[48:21.53]Can I help you with something?
[48:24.31]I'm here on behalf of Xavier.
[48:27.38]Okay, you're the new YouTuber in town.
[48:28.88]Well, Xavier called me to give you this.
[48:31.92]You are the console HoneyPlayStudios1 in the game Deity of War.
[48:36.10]I would not hold this like this.
[48:41.74]They're all stored in your bag.
[48:43.96]The bag has limited space.
[48:50.51]This is just how people that go to the midnight release for games do this.
[48:54.91]They run out.
[48:55.39]If you're the first in line, you run out with the thing.
[48:57.17]You hold it up and everyone fucking cheers.
[48:59.03]Everyone's like, yeah!
[49:05.06]Hey, David, do you have the game and console yet?
[49:07.52]Yes.
[49:10.00]Great.
[49:10.23]Now let's record your first gameplay.
[49:14.41]Oh, a new WoW expansion.
[49:20.38]Oh dude, Wrath of the Lich King!
[49:21.82]Are you serious?
[49:33.37]Naxx is out.
[49:34.70]Alright, let's go make a gameplay video.
[49:39.38]Wow, I played WoW for like 30 years.
[49:41.84]I'm gonna make a reference to it every now and then.
[49:44.84]I have talked about this before, but listen to this.
[49:47.70]I have been, there's more wow in my head than I believe potentially time that I was in college.
[49:56.99]You understand?
[49:59.77]Like the amount of time that I was sitting in a classroom in college probably is the amount of time also that I was in World of Warcraft.
[50:08.14]It was hundreds of days.
[50:11.88]So of course it's going to be up there.
[50:20.03]Head is empty.
[50:21.77]No, it's just, it's, no, you know what?
[50:23.95]My head, the head is too full.
[50:26.54]I would like to go in to my head and sort of defrag it and just sort of delete a bunch of old info that I don't even care about anymore to make room for more shit.
[50:36.92]To record a gameplay, you first need to place the game and console in the gaming corner.
[50:45.79]And select the game and get recording.
[50:53.12]You make me want to quit video games so I don't end up like you.
[50:58.20]What?
[51:00.85]Why?
[51:01.05]I'm not like screaming at you.
[51:06.19]What does that mean?
[51:10.43]I'm pretty normal.
[51:11.43]I'm just like hanging out.
[51:13.31]What do you mean?
[51:13.79]I don't want to end up like you.
[51:15.20]I don't have any consoles.
[51:22.80]Oh, here we go.
[51:23.18]Console Storage 1.
[51:23.88]How do I put it on?
[51:29.38]Oh, here it is.
[51:29.72]Okay.
[51:31.64]Console and video game.
[51:33.06]Let's go.
[51:33.46]Alright.
[51:34.76]It's time to record video.
[51:37.42]With Deity of War.
[51:39.17]Join Prometheus on his mission to save humanity.
[51:41.35]Tutorial First Impressions Speedrun Analysis
[51:53.52]Okay, I have to have gameplay reactions?
[51:59.82]You start recording and?
[52:01.98]Say hello, yeah, whatever.
[52:03.30]I have to play the game.
[52:05.11]You unlock a new map.
[52:07.97]You ship.
[52:11.85]I unlocked a new map.
[52:13.43]I don't understand.
[52:19.81]You play for giggles.
[52:24.19]Your health is at 1%, but you skip.
[52:28.53]You skip?
[52:30.34]No, but you skip?
[52:32.34]You ship?
[52:33.58]Your health is at 1%, so you ship.
[52:37.10]You skip?
[52:39.54]You skip?
[52:40.14]You ship?
[52:42.26]What am I doing?
[52:44.83]You ship and it's over.
[52:46.39]Let's get some subs.
[52:59.30]Skip and ship.
[53:01.44]Ship is relationship.
[53:04.78]But who?
[53:05.54]It said I unlocked a new map.
[53:12.51]What am I shipping the Monopoly pieces?
[53:15.39]Like I have a board?
[53:16.22]Just a map?
[53:18.08]I don't get it.
[53:22.70]Alright, let's go.
[53:23.26]Edit.
[53:23.46]Time to edit.
[53:25.50]And for everyone to hate me because I do this wrong every time.
[53:27.44]I'm going to do this wrong every single time.
[53:28.76]Just want to make sure people are aware of that.
[53:29.84]I'm going to do this wrong every single fucking time.
[53:32.32]I'm not kidding.
[53:34.30]Alright, let's go with... Double.
[53:39.60]Double.
[53:40.08]No, not that one.
[53:43.12]That one.
[53:44.04]That one.
[53:44.60]There we go.
[53:45.00]There we go.
[53:46.14]Alright.
[53:50.91]There we go.
[53:57.49]Thumbnail.
[54:00.81]This one.
[54:02.83]Become an expert in Deity of War in 10 minutes.
[54:06.43]20 never-before-seen adventure tricks.
[54:08.25]The Deity of War revolution.
[54:12.18]They hate this, though.
[54:12.94]Is that a good enough title?
[54:31.36]So I just skip every cutscene and just ship every character?
[54:38.85]Okay.
[54:42.83]Part 4.
[54:43.39]Oh, they like it.
[54:47.09]They like it.
[54:57.93]Alright.
[54:59.29]I published a gameplay.
[55:00.15]I did it.
[55:06.42]My energy's low.
[55:07.08]What did I get?
[55:10.92]A plain hamburger?
[55:14.60]There are people buried in my backyard.
[55:16.92]Hey, David, I thought you might be hungry after a long session of recording and editing videos.
[55:20.70]Here's a plain hamburger.
[55:21.98]You won't be able to record or edit videos if your energy runs out.
[55:30.99]For plenty of energy, you eat something or go to sleep.
[55:35.18]Bunk a W. Eating a plain hamburger is like, that's serial killer vibes for me.
[55:40.21]A plain hamburger with nothing on it, nothing, just bun and meat?
[55:43.83]That's it.
[55:44.09]I mean, if there was ketchup on it, anything.
[55:54.53]It's weird, right?
[55:56.71]Does any of you guys eat just a plain, just one hamburger patty and just bun?
[56:04.57]I feel like everybody adds something.
[56:06.51]Whether it's like a squeeze of- I'm serious, even like a squeeze of mustard, like a tablespoon of mustard makes that not weird to me.
[56:19.58]MonkaS, chat full of serial killers.
[56:21.66]Alright, luckily Xavier just sent you some food.
[56:29.89]I'm not gonna eat food somebody sent in a box.
[56:34.28]A tablespoon is a lot of mustard.
[56:36.50]I've seen a lot of people put way more mustard than that.
[56:40.96]What do I eat?
[56:44.28]Big AFK.
[56:46.04]An irresistible hamburger with... Okay.
[56:48.76]It's fine.
[56:51.22]Although, I would remove the tomato.
[56:56.00]I would remove the tomato, and I would probably remove the ketchup as well.
[57:02.80]I'm not gonna do, look, I don't have to do the tomato sucks rant every, like, two months.
[57:08.63]We should have a clip for it.
[57:10.85]Because, I mean, every time I talk about how I don't like tomato, people go, what are you talking about?
[57:14.87]So should I just do a clip so people would take, like, uh, like, exclamation point, like, tomato?
[57:26.12]Okay.
[57:26.79]Here we go.
[57:27.83]Just real quick.
[57:28.39]I'm gonna get this out of the way.
[57:30.53]Tomato on sandwiches or burgers or anything.
[57:33.33]If you put a slice of... No, don't get me wrong.
[57:35.51]I love tomatoes.
[57:37.79]I love the vegetable tomato.
[57:38.97]I love tomato sauce.
[57:40.38]I love roasted tomatoes.
[57:42.50]Roasted cherry tomatoes.
[57:43.70]I like tomato... If it's a tomato dish, I love it.
[57:47.54]A slice of tomato on a hamburger or a sandwich is disgusting to me.
[57:56.09]Because the tomato is usually wet and slimy and if you take a bite it turns to like this weird sludgy water in your mouth and sometimes you pull the whole tomato out while you pull back.
[58:09.76]A tomato does not necessarily belong on a sandwich for me.
[58:13.82]It makes whatever you're eating wetter.
[58:16.95]Let me ask you a question.
[58:18.33]You know how you wash lettuce?
[58:21.08]Imagine you took just wet lettuce.
[58:23.46]You rinsed lettuce.
[58:24.50]You didn't even let it dry.
[58:25.28]You just washed it.
[58:26.40]It was soaking wet and you put it right on the bun.
[58:28.32]And it's going to be watery.
[58:29.62]Watery lettuce and soggy.
[58:31.24]You really want that?
[58:38.16]You got to let it dry.
[58:39.04]Wait for it to dry.
[58:40.52]It cools it down.
[58:42.00]How hot are you eating your hamburgers?
[58:44.50]What temperature are you eating your meat at?
[58:48.18]It cools the burger down?
[58:53.14]Okay, so clip that.
[58:55.30]I love tomatoes.
[58:56.16]I do.
[58:59.48]I just don't like tomatoes sliced on a sandwich.
[59:01.52]It kind of messes it up for me.
[59:06.46]I feel the same way about some onions.
[59:09.09]Right?
[59:09.27]I love onions on a... I love onions on a tomato, but I don't want it on... Somebody's ringing.
[59:15.19]What is it?
[59:16.63]Now, why don't you relax a bit and explore the city?
[59:20.71]You're new in town and you need to meet people.
[59:22.23]Having good friends will definitely help your YouTuber career.
[59:27.08]There are certain celebrities and odd neighbors in NewTubeCity.
[59:29.58]Why don't you go meet them?
[59:31.90]Okay, let me close that out.
[59:33.88]Onions are good on a burger, but they have to be done... I don't like it when it's just a big circle onion ring without the bread on it.
[59:42.45]You know what I'm talking about?
[59:43.97]Why do people do that?
[59:45.83]You get like, you bite it and you get like fucking onion skin and like the whole chunk comes off it.
[59:50.34]No, no, I don't get that.
[59:53.60]Chopped onions, yes.
[59:54.92]Sliced onions, yes.
[59:55.90]But that big onion ring onion?
[59:59.14]No.
[60:06.36]You're a nine-year-old.
[60:08.34]No, I'm just, I don't like weird texture on my hamburgers.
[60:14.35]Do your teeth not work?
[60:15.33]It's just, no, I don't like it.
[60:16.79]It's, what are you talking about?
[60:21.85]Do you like tobaccos?
[60:23.63]What?
[60:25.59]Just order tomato on the side.
[60:27.17]It doesn't sog up the sandwich burger when you order to go.
[60:29.75]Yeah, but eventually I'm going to be putting it on, am I just going to eat the tomato like a potato chip?
[60:37.32]Can I have a slice of tomato on the side, like just to go?
[60:42.70]Yes?
[60:46.51]I don't really like tomatoes like that.
[60:48.85]Don't listen to them.
[60:49.55]You're right.
[60:50.03]I just don't like tomatoes like that.
[60:52.99]Because the seed, the tomato insides, I don't know.
[60:56.89]It's just like... I don't like it.
[61:01.07]It's too mushy to be on a sandwich.
[61:07.35]What if they put tomato paste on a burger?
[61:09.73]You're referring to ketchup, which I think is good.
[61:14.31]I like ketchup.
[61:15.43]That's fine.
[61:18.79]Dude, you know, if they made, like, a hamburger, uh... Tomato paste.
[61:26.31]Alright, I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
[61:28.84]If they made a burger that was, you know, like a chicken palm sandwich?
[61:32.96]What if it was a burger palm?
[61:35.86]And it was just a cheeseburger, but it had, like, marinara sauce and cheese on it.
[61:40.46]That might not actually be pretty good.
[61:42.67]Hamburger palm.
[61:46.17]There's your tomato paste hamburger.
[61:50.85]Alright, what am I supposed to be doing?
[61:52.01]You guys are distracting me.
[61:58.59]Okay, spicy rend.
[61:59.81]The best spicy dishes in New Tube City.
[62:01.53]Alright, so there's the restaurant.
[62:02.47]Alright, we got trends here.
[62:05.66]Should I make another video?
[62:06.94]I was going to make another video.
[62:08.00]Why not?
[62:08.54]Meet 10 neighbors.
[62:09.54]Alright, we're making another video.
[62:10.70]Alright, we're going to do a gameplay.
[62:16.46]Okay.
[62:18.14]And can I talk about cats?
[62:20.30]You start and I shyly say hello.
[62:24.35]A mini-boss appears and... You make a technical comment.
[62:29.93]You explain the lore.
[62:32.29]You skip the boss.
[62:34.87]Uh-oh, all the gamers didn't like that.
[62:36.72]You sense a paranormal presence.
[62:40.54]You make a technical comment.
[62:44.46]You sign off and it's over.
[62:50.12]Should have talked about the lore.
[62:51.26]Do these have a description?
[62:56.94]I don't really know what these all mean.
[62:58.02]Alright, let's go publish it.
[63:06.38]I should do a vlog too, shouldn't I?
[63:07.62]Alright, let's start with this one.
[63:12.68]I'm gonna go...
[63:16.84]With, uh, this one, this one, this one.
[63:22.12]Sure, why not?
[63:24.88]I don't care about what the title is.
[63:25.98]It doesn't matter.
[63:26.66]Should I just do one of these?
[63:29.02]Get the latest, the biggest gameplay pro.
[63:33.03]How about the biggest gameplay pro of adventure?
[63:36.27]When I skip the boss.
[63:39.55]That's gonna piss off subscribers, though.
[63:48.55]My gameplay on home.
[63:51.13]I think that's probably the default for if you save like a PlayStation 4 video on the PS4.
[64:05.76]Action.
[64:06.36]Gameplay.
[64:08.32]Another gameplay.
[64:10.13]The best gameplay.
[64:11.11]Gameplay.
[64:11.51]What about adventure?
[64:12.37]Another gameplay.
[64:13.55]The best thing about Deity of War.
[64:14.99]Gameplay.
[64:16.31]Home.
[64:16.91]Gameplay.
[64:18.51]Gameplay?
[64:19.05]What about adventure?
[64:20.53]We're going to talk about adventure.
[64:21.91]Gameplay.
[64:22.57]That's good.
[64:34.68]Do a two-minute fart prank video with eight-minute vlog about family stuff.
[64:45.27]A two-minute fart prank?
[64:49.98]I gotta go meet people, but I'm tired.
[64:51.60]Hold on.
[65:01.23]Why would you read that?
[65:04.45]My house is... Wait a minute.
[65:07.37]My home's value is increasing because my subscribers are increasing?
[65:11.86]That's weird.
[65:24.40]That's how it works.
[65:26.76]Do you leave a bowl of candy out for trick-or-treaters, you asshole?
[65:39.16]Excuse me.
[65:39.76]That's trespassing.
[65:46.97]No.
[65:49.13]Good morning, David.
[65:49.93]Did you know that the event all the YouTubers are waiting for is coming to the city in the last week of spring?
[66:01.11]I don't know what that is.
[66:06.02]It's the Playcon Gaming Festival and it's celebrated once a year in New Tube City.
[66:13.29]This festival will be full of influential people from the area, conferences, events.
[66:16.31]You can't miss the Playcon if you want to make yourself known.
[66:19.21]You're gonna get egged.
[66:26.87]Can you imagine I had, like, a note?
[66:29.55]Imagine you lived in a place, and you put a note on your door.
[66:33.28]No Halloween decorations, nothing.
[66:35.54]And it just said, like, the act of trick-or-treating is trespassing.
[66:39.92]I do not support this archaic, old, stupid lifestyle or something, right?
[66:45.12]You have, like, a huge note on the door.
[66:51.35]That's the kind of person that I would assume would be the person that's complaining if you had, like, an HOA or something about, like, your garbage cans being too far away from the curb.
[67:01.05]That's who that person, I think, is, right?
[67:10.00]By the way, use the fact that everyone is talking about the PlayCon Festival to your advantage and post PlayCon content.
[67:19.47]Tee-peed or egged.
[67:22.03]Would you just wake up to like a completely mummified house?
[67:30.02]I feel like you'd walk out the door, turn around, and your house would be just completely mummified.
[67:45.10]And then it rains.
[67:45.96]Oh, God.
[67:51.68]What if it rained?
[67:53.25]Your house would just be taped.
[67:59.27]Paper mache.
[68:00.15]Alright, let's go to the convention.
[68:06.07]There's a huge promotional poster in the city.
[68:08.31]You know how you can post content almost instantly for your followers?
[68:13.37]How?
[68:14.51]With the InstaLife app.
[68:17.47]No.
[68:18.88]Listen to me, guys.
[68:19.66]Listen to me.
[68:21.10]Listen to me.
[68:23.23]Whatever you're doing right now, stop what you're doing.
[68:26.66]Turn the volume up a little bit.
[68:28.46]And sit here for a moment.
[68:30.34]And listen to me.
[68:33.64]You don't gotta do all that shit.
[68:36.32]You don't have to.
[68:37.26]It's okay.
[68:38.06]You don't have to do all this.
[68:40.56]You don't have to have like 30 Instagram posts a week.
[68:43.36]You don't have to be on Twitter every day.
[68:46.56]You don't have to do this.
[68:47.24]You don't have to do that.
[68:52.23]Listen up.
[68:56.77]Fucking video game.
[68:59.67]Listen to me.
[69:01.41]Let's get serious.
[69:05.44]I do it because I want to.
[69:06.94]Yeah, I hope that's true.
[69:10.06]I feel like there's a shitload.
[69:11.24]Let's get real.
[69:11.78]You ready?
[69:13.20]I feel like there's a shitload of pressure right now on a lot of people that are in the younger age brackets to constantly need to sort of make everybody aware of what they're doing.
[69:27.09]Just do it in moderation.
[69:28.81]Trust me.
[69:32.13]It feels like a lot of the younger crowd is in a constant competition with each other.
[69:37.86]You know what I'm saying?
[69:38.54]You're getting political.
[69:47.58]That's not political.
[69:48.36]That's just life.
[69:52.35]I'm so glad I'm not growing up with the social media stuff from today.
[69:54.55]I can't imagine how damaging that mindset is to little kids.
[69:58.89]Yeah, just be careful.
[70:00.26]Don't get too into it.
[70:01.96]Don't let it consume you, because it can.
[70:05.18]Especially when you're really young, too.
[70:06.52]Some of the 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds.
[70:10.60]I don't know.
[70:11.04]I feel like I'd be in this constant mindset of constant... You've got a lot of shit to worry about, too, when you're a teenager, right?
[70:18.35]It's another thing to have to be in a constant competition about.
[70:27.71]It's limited.
[70:32.17]This stream is 18+.
[70:33.53]They're not here.
[70:34.67]Move on.
[70:42.72]It's a social network app for you to share your photos with your followers instantly.
[70:45.62]This will also help you make yourself a known person in the city.
[70:49.60]You can also follow people you know, see what they're posting, and they can even send you private messages.
[70:58.36]They've done surveys that said that... Yeah, it's a lot to have to pay attention to.
[71:04.18]Like, guys, I only... I post, like, once every three months on Twitter.
[71:10.44]I have to disconnect.
[71:11.32]I have to.
[71:20.20]Jerma fans are proto-boomers that live under rocks and only watch Jerma and eat Taco Bell.
[71:25.32]I was a proto-boomer.
[71:35.00]Your companion, DrunculaTube, will install the app for you.
[71:37.96]Alright, let's play.
[71:38.42]Alright, installing InstaLife.
[71:41.26]Open it now.
[71:45.00]Publish a photo with PlayCon.
[71:46.76]But I'm not there.
[71:47.74]Am I going to pretend I'm at PlayCon?
[71:55.92]This year, the PlayCon is coming to NewTubeCity.
[71:58.22]I am not going to miss it.
[72:00.03]I am.
[72:01.57]I'm not going.
[72:04.96]I'm not going.
[72:08.39]No.
[72:09.11]I'm not going.
[72:09.67]Am I following?
[72:19.61]Okay.
[72:21.37]Where is it?
[72:23.17]Playcon.
[72:23.95]I'm not going.
[72:25.05]Open from 7th to the 12th.
[72:26.81]Wait, what?
[72:30.85]This convention is...
[72:33.75]Like 20 days?
[72:39.69]Oh my goodness.
[72:41.67]That's insane.
[72:46.47]Well, now I have to go.
[72:47.55]I have to go for at least one of those days.
[72:51.05]Did I already do that?
[73:03.29]Okay, publish a photo with Playcon.
[73:05.25]Okay, I gotta go take a photo.
[73:08.56]Let's go.
[73:48.55]Got it?
[73:56.73]Post.
[74:02.83]Oh, shit.
[74:07.47]Not going to Playcon, staying home with my cats and playing... Oh, cats aren't trending anymore.
[74:14.37]Oh, I just, like, copied her.
[74:18.06]This looks like a sarcastic, mean response to this, doesn't it?
[74:29.27]Yeah.
[74:30.13]I'm trying to get the contrarian crowd, right?
[74:34.19]It's a subtweet.
[74:34.95]It's a contrarian subtweet.
[74:36.17]That's what this is.
[74:40.36]Alright, let's go.
[74:45.08]I didn't get it?
[74:47.32]I have to go take a picture in front of the... Alright.
[74:53.70]All the gamers are waiting for Playcon.
[74:54.96]Why don't you create content on it?
[74:56.53]Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[74:57.85]Where is it?
[74:58.27]Nice hit, hit M. Where is it?
[75:04.12]Alright, it's down here.
[75:16.45]Boxing gym?
[75:17.49]Record video.
[75:18.69]Oh shit.
[75:25.63]Vlog in front of the boxing gym?
[75:31.11]Am I like a reporter?
[75:32.90]What am I doing here?
[75:36.38]Full of energy.
[75:38.76]Thank you followers for the support and you think it's a good piece of information.
[75:42.60]Flatter yourself in front of the gym.
[75:45.42]I gotta get swole.
[75:47.19]A poltergeist appears.
[75:50.33]And you make a bad joke.
[75:51.29]Uh, losing battery.
[75:55.43]Alright, ask for subs and get up.
[76:03.99]He's hallucinating.
[76:06.57]Oh, that's actually a four-star video.
[76:08.95]I'm going to hold on to this until people think boxing and gyms and whatever is cool.
[76:15.11]Because I can just hold on to this video for potentially years and upload it whenever I want.
[76:24.40]I can just act like I recorded it yesterday.
[76:29.06]I'm going to take a picture in front of the sign.
[76:32.77]Oh, wait.
[76:33.09]Now I actually... Hold on.
[77:07.27]I can't.
[77:08.87]It's...
[77:46.25]Okay.
[77:51.85]There we go.
[78:03.48]This year's PlayCon has me so excited.
[78:05.98]Staying home is cool, but I heard Deity of War is getting DLC.
[78:11.78]Not going to PlayCon, staying home with my cats and playing Deity of War.
[78:14.96]This is like an AI account.
[78:19.16]These are the kinds of accounts that you see on, like, across, like, the dating apps.
[78:26.87]It's like, this is a really fucking person?
[78:34.41]Like, is this even a real dude?
[78:40.24]Should I just do it again and just copy?
[78:42.70]This year, the PlayCon is coming to NewTubeCity.
[78:44.92]I'm not going to miss it.
[78:46.64]Just do that, just repost that.
[79:26.29]Oh, people didn't like that one as much.
[79:38.21]This account sucks.
[79:40.53]I need to put all these hashtags in it.
[79:42.37]Okay, hold on.
[79:43.79]Remember these.
[79:44.27]Playcon Adventure Armored Nucleus Honey Play... We gotta remember these.
[79:48.42]Somebody write these down.
[79:53.28]Have you noticed that the trend you just got has been captured?
[79:56.77]There are trends that when you discover them remain captured and you can talk about them in another kind of script.
[80:02.51]See which script you can use it in and take the opportunity to record a video of it because it only lasts one day.
[80:07.31]Can I record a video in front of this?
[80:11.70]Post a gameplay with Playcon.
[80:18.08]Oh, shit.
[80:18.74]Okay, hold on.
[80:21.46]What is this Nev?
[80:23.76]Oh, Playcon!
[80:27.93]Am I interviewing?
[80:28.67]Oh, I'm interviewing somebody at Playcon.
[80:33.76]All these camera angles are terrible.
[80:38.56]Why would this be a camera angle?
[80:40.32]Alright, it's this one.
[80:40.94]Okay, you're running out of energy.
[80:44.60]Sleep.
[80:45.68]Oh, come on.
[80:46.54]Really?
[80:46.80]Do you have any food?
[80:48.63]Let me go eat something.
[80:51.73]I'll be right back.
[81:00.76]How much money do I have?
[81:03.26]Are subscribers money?
[81:04.42]Where's that restaurant?
[81:12.16]It's down here, right?
[81:17.18]Am I?
[81:17.40]It's right here.
[81:24.54]Coins.
[81:25.26]Oh, right.
[81:25.70]That's a weird... I don't know.
[81:26.80]It looks weird.
[81:31.26]I wish there was a sprint.
[81:36.06]Alright, record.
[81:36.52]No, no, no.
[81:36.88]I can't record a video.
[81:37.50]I have to eat.
[81:37.82]Okay, what am I going to get?
[81:44.87]Uh, Susie.
[81:49.41]Oh, nice.
[81:49.73]A new face in the city.
[81:51.00]What's your name, dear?
[81:53.77]David, where are you?
[81:56.07]Susie, I'm the owner of Spicy Wren.
[81:57.89]I would not go up and introduce myself to the owner.
[82:00.17]I would sit down and order food.
[82:03.60]Okay.
[82:07.66]Alright, takeout.
[82:10.66]Vegetable wok takeout.
[82:14.44]It's rice seasoned with spicy peppers.
[82:18.79]Probably just this one.
[82:19.43]This is the cheapest one, right?
[82:23.98]And now let's eat.
[82:29.62]Meeting with my hands?
[82:30.52]Alright, let's go make that video.
[82:39.31]No, I have to get the Playcon video.
[82:45.47]You have to make a mukbang.
[82:47.31]I'm not gonna do a mukbang.
[82:51.11]Make a mukbang.
[82:52.17]No!
[82:53.79]I don't think you can.
[82:54.43]Alright, up here.
[83:03.04]Did I say it wrong?
[83:06.52]How do you say it?
[83:16.62]Isn't that how it's pronounced?
[83:24.12]Alright, I gotta interview these guys.
[83:29.66]Alright.
[83:30.20]Okay.
[83:30.62]What are you looking forward to at Play Studios Con?
[83:36.02]Here we go.
[83:37.24]Start and... We're full of energy here.
[83:40.33]I heard D&D of War's got some DLC coming out.
[83:42.37]You play D&D of War yet?
[83:44.97]It's a paranormal presence.
[83:49.95]You were merciless with the hater from the previous video, but...
[83:54.89]You're in chill mode.
[83:55.57]What does that have to do with an interview?
[83:58.78]To finish, you sign off.
[84:00.24]This person didn't even say anything.
[84:07.58]Alright, thanks for the interview.
[84:13.73]Alright, got that.
[84:14.99]I'm so tired.
[84:15.71]How do I go home?
[84:16.37]Fast.
[84:20.85]I only have 8 hours to post a gameplay.
[84:22.77]I'm not going to be able to.
[84:29.08]I have a long way to go.
[84:30.04]Gameplay.
[84:33.96]Oh, okay.
[84:34.46]200 new views.
[84:45.03]I can only sleep for like four hours.
[84:49.37]Where's my fucking apartment?
[84:50.67]Whatever it is.
[84:54.23]I can take the bus?
[84:59.39]Alright, hurry, hurry, hurry, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[85:07.83]Can I do it?
[85:09.75]No, I have to sleep.
[85:10.51]I can't edit a video.
[85:12.39]Shit.
[85:15.09]How long do I sleep for?
[85:15.83]Oh, I could have eaten the noodles?
[85:29.38]Oh no, I missed the trend.
[85:33.73]Free Ticket Playcon Challenge.
[85:35.95]Fuck, I'm so behind.
[85:37.73]This is old news now.
[85:41.47]Good morning, David.
[85:42.79]I didn't mention it before, but the ticket to the festival costs 500 coins.
[85:48.70]It's a lot of money, but there's a way of getting a little extra money since your videos aren't generating that much.
[85:54.40]Doing errands for your neighbors.
[85:58.81]There's an app where you can accept an order from anyone in the city in exchange for rewards.
[86:02.38]It's the Commissions app.
[86:05.44]The start of any YouTuber's career isn't easy.
[86:07.32]So if you need some money, well, use this app.
[86:11.46]Your companion, DroneKillatube, will install the app for you.
[86:16.84]Installing the Commissions app on your phone.
[86:20.84]You can open it now.
[86:21.54]I just wanted to tell you that I loved your last picture.
[86:25.40]Who said that?
[86:28.20]Who said that?
[86:34.97]That was the Grand Cars race launch.
[86:38.44]Who said that?
[86:40.60]I got the free ticket to the PlayCon.
[86:42.92]I won't say how, just that there are three people in different areas of the city with the PlayCon t-shirt who might know something.
[86:53.80]Okay.
[86:54.92]Good to know.
[86:56.38]The PlayCon.
[87:00.59]Deliver a package to Blair.
[87:03.31]Pick up a package at Spicy Run.
[87:04.83]I got it.
[87:05.21]Let's do it.
[87:10.76]Get the ticket to the Playcon.
[87:13.56]First of all, we have to edit this video.
[87:17.92]The interview and the vlog.
[87:19.48]Let's do the interview first.
[87:21.28]Okay.
[87:25.90]Start there.
[87:30.54]Alright, looking good.
[87:43.64]And things about Playcon that will surprise you.
[87:47.02]Weirdest interview on YouTube.
[87:48.24]Okay.
[87:54.28]Subscribers don't really care.
[87:55.88]Yeah, we'll do clickbait.
[88:00.99]Subscriber morale, that means they don't really care that much, but visibility is high.
[88:11.69]Oh.
[88:12.72]Shit.
[88:17.82]This game takes the most insufferable parts of YouTube and ranks it up.
[88:25.58]I got another video to make, hold on.
[88:34.23]Damn it.
[88:35.11]Okay, it has to be this one to start.
[88:39.23]And then... Fuck.
[88:45.33]Fuck.
[88:48.82]I don't think I can finish this one.
[88:59.00]You can't start with this because of the red, right?
[89:02.19]No, it has to be this one.
[89:11.28]Damn it.
[89:14.04]Oh, whatever.
[89:14.44]I don't care.
[89:14.80]I don't even care.
[89:18.76]Publish it.
[89:23.10]I don't know what this was.
[89:25.66]The Center.
[89:26.72]The biggest vlog pro of Center.
[89:32.16]Another vlog with Center.
[89:33.50]Center vlog.
[89:34.16]Center vlog.
[89:35.04]Laughing about Center vlog.
[89:36.79]Sure.
[89:41.92]Oh, this is in front of the gym!
[89:43.62]Oh shit!
[89:48.89]They liked it.
[89:52.73]They actually liked it.
[89:53.55]Alright, I gotta get that ticket.
[90:04.12]Put on a shirt.
[90:04.84]I will after I go to the bathroom.
[90:07.57]People are loving Battle Royale games lately, so I gotta go buy one.
[90:10.11]How much is it?
[90:10.89]I have $87.
[90:11.57]We're gonna do that first.
[90:12.45]We're gonna jump on the trend.
[90:13.29]I don't give a shit about Playcon.
[90:15.49]What's going on over here?
[90:21.87]Alright, I gotta deliver that package.
[90:31.13]We'll do that first, and then I'm gonna go buy a Battle Royale game.
[90:42.72]Do the delivery.
[90:43.32]I'm going for it right now.
[90:53.75]That person was pretending to be a dev and I was reading it.
[90:56.03]It was a long message and they got nuked when I got to the last sentence.
[91:02.40]Give me this package.
[91:05.94]Alright, I gotta deliver this to... I'm going to the Play Store anyways.
[91:22.32]We like Fortnite.
[91:23.28]We like Fortnite.
[91:24.98]No, I don't want to go home.
[91:26.42]Just take the... It was an Alt-F4 joke.
[91:38.09]Where's this stupid video game place?
[91:41.91]Down, okay.
[91:46.45]Oh, ooh.
[91:46.93]Ooh.
[91:55.27]There's a delivery.
[91:55.93]And I gotta buy a Battle Royale game.
[92:01.57]Um, don't I have a delivery?
[92:04.85]Yeah, what do you want?
[92:06.59]I have a delivery.
[92:07.57]How do I deliver this?
[92:18.30]Where'd it go?
[92:26.91]Octoblair?
[92:27.53]I have to hold it in my hands?
[92:40.48]Oh!
[92:40.60]Here.
[92:48.03]Thanks, I was waiting for it.
[92:49.87]I'll take a hundred bucks, and now... I would like to purchase a Battle Royale game, please.
[92:57.16]It's a MOBA.
[92:57.82]It's a shooter.
[92:58.40]I need a Battle Royale.
[93:03.02]Nope.
[93:05.61]Battle Royale.
[93:07.31]Are there no Battle Royale games?
[93:16.78]League of Stars.
[93:20.00]I have to add a different store.
[93:21.18]Alright, well, never mind.
[93:25.35]Somebody has a t-shirt, right?
[93:27.43]People have Playcon t-shirts.
[93:40.82]Fortnite is free.
[93:41.70]Not in this world.
[93:44.38]Alright, now I gotta find people with Playcon shirts.
[93:53.65]What's going on here?
[94:10.43]I need different... Come here.
[94:13.23]Look at camera.

[94:34.21]Alright.
[95:10.32]That's good.
[95:15.74]Alright, that's good.
[95:22.49]I'm getting a lot of followers on this platform.
[95:25.91]This game is propaganda.
[95:28.45]It's not.
[95:30.58]It's just a game.
[95:31.44]Don't worry.
[95:37.78]What do I need to do?
[95:41.83]Alright, when does Playcon start?
[95:44.77]I need somebody with a Playcon tee.
[95:45.95]Can I go in?
[95:47.29]What if I just walk over here?
[95:53.95]Let me in!

[96:22.01]Oh my god.
[96:22.89]I can see all the boots.
[96:25.09]What do I have to do?
[96:25.59]I have to record first.

[98:36.40]No, but we're going to make a fountain video.
[98:42.68]You can't record in the dark?
[98:53.06]Why do you look like you're gonna kick somebody's sandcastle at the beach?
[98:55.34]That's a good question.
[98:59.13]You're right.
[99:01.67]Nobody- I can't get Playcon tickets.

[99:28.03]What is it?
[99:30.23]No, I don't.
[99:30.77]Shit.
[99:31.57]I want to read that book.
[99:36.91]Old place and home.

[110:39.40]Okay.
[110:40.86]Now, I gotta make the subscribers happy.
[110:43.05]How did I used to do that to you guys?
[110:45.37]If you guys were, like, pissed about something, what did I do usually right after?
[110:49.43]Anything?
[110:53.69]I didn't.
[110:54.84]I would make shpee noises.
[110:56.76]I'm not sure.
[110:57.64]I don't think I've ever really pissed off, like, my subscriber base in quotes.
[111:01.76]I'm not sure I've ever really done that.
[111:02.76]Not that I can think of.
[111:13.42]I'm pissed off.
[111:14.74]You have.
[111:17.14]You absolutely have.

[111:54.30]Gameplay.
[111:54.78]Start the video.
[111:56.94]We're gonna be very, we're gonna be a little bit on the muted side.
[112:01.40]You're the imposter.
[112:06.56]You make a technical comment.
[112:09.88]Like, it's not everything.
[112:11.39]You go on and on and then you play for giggles.
[112:19.18]To finish, you sign off.
[112:28.46]Suss.
[112:31.28]Alright, this is actually going to be the best.
[112:32.76]This is a four star recording and a three star trend.
[112:38.74]This might actually be my big break here.
[112:45.56]You're running up.
[112:46.18]Oh my god, eat something.
[112:58.90]Among Us gameplay?
[112:59.80]This is not Among Us gameplay.
[113:06.18]No.
[113:06.32]Is that the best combo I can do?
[113:11.68]Maybe not.
[113:16.57]I think it is.
[113:18.63]Yeah.
[113:22.91]Thumbnail.
[113:23.29]It's going to be the wave.
[113:24.93]And we have to clickbait this, I think.
[113:27.13]No.
[113:27.77]No.
[113:30.48]Hashtag watch cats About no, okay But you know the tactic the the tactic you put a sentence as the title that is one to two seconds of your whole video and
[114:01.81]And it might be a 12 minute video.
[114:05.37]That's the tactic.
[114:06.85]That's how you do it.
[114:09.55]Like, for instance.
[114:20.70]That would be the title for the VOD of the Far Cry 6 stream.
[114:27.81]Technically, that's not a lie.
[114:31.21]Happened at some point.
[114:34.55]It's there somewhere.
[114:39.29]Just make it that.

[116:18.29]It's not bad.
[116:21.53]You don't sleep with a blanket?
[116:22.45]Why are you posting videos at 9 p.m.?
[116:34.48]I used to do that.
[116:35.02]When I'm having a bad day, nothing makes me happier than to see you publish a new video.
[116:40.02]I never miss one.
[116:41.84]Well, there's only been five, so I appreciate that, though.
[116:45.38]Um... New commission?

[117:51.63]Everyone's talking about that game.
[117:53.63]I don't.
[117:54.61]I'm still making Watch Cats videos.
[117:59.59]What do they do for moves?
[118:14.58]This one looks the closest here.
[118:15.90]Ready?
[118:23.87]They put their hand up, and I'm going to make it look like I'm doing it too.

[122:08.87]I have to make a video.
[122:17.20]You answer a hater from a previous video, and you let out a WTF.
[122:23.24]You thank your followers for the support, and you think it's a good piece of information.
[122:28.70]Yeah, we did too!
[122:30.48]To finish, ask for some subs.
[122:37.01]That's a four-star recording.
[122:44.23]Okay, save it.

[125:08.05]They're calling the person the New Tube City Thief.
[125:11.70]Yeah, I know.
[125:12.20]Whoever came up with that name deserves a good scolding for abusing cliches.
[125:15.52]It's a burglar?
[125:21.06]Organic water?
[125:26.87]Did I just buy that?
[125:28.17]How much was that?

[125:58.11]Nobody has a shirt on that I can talk to.
[125:59.91]He's going to go home.
[126:17.07]Nobody has a shirt.
[126:18.05]I said, look at people.
[126:18.73]Let me make sure I'm reading this right.
[126:23.17]Get 500 coins.
[126:23.87]Alright.
[126:24.45]I just have to do boat jobs until I can get it.

[126:46.33]What else do you know?
[126:47.76]Are you one of my fans?
[126:48.98]If you want to say something, do it on InstaLife fan page or go to the boxing gym.
[126:55.62]I'm going to go thumbs down your last post.
[127:07.35]Oh, shit.
[127:07.83]Amazing billboard outside of Oscar Cinema this week.
[127:09.92]Don't miss it.
[127:16.12]My classmate's best friend's cousin's girlfriend said that she saw a stalker near the port.
[127:25.37]Is it a movie?
[127:26.51]Or is it a person?
[127:27.25]Okay.
[127:43.84]Get out of here.
[127:46.29]I want to get the anomaly.
[127:47.81]Okay.
[127:58.84]I need to... Whatever.
[128:02.24]I'm going back and I'm going to upload a vlog of me talking about SawCon.
[128:05.60]It's not SawCon.
[128:06.78]It's PlayCon, but whatever.
[128:08.02]Does it matter?
[128:09.03]This is a vlog outside of... I don't even know where this was.
[128:15.19]The theater.
[128:15.69]Okay.
[128:23.93]We go.
[129:00.78]Did I play a game?
[129:01.64]Alright, I'm gonna play... Watch Cats is still pretty popular.
[129:06.80]Let's go.
[129:07.58]Gameplay.
[129:08.24]Alright, do I have any food?
[129:12.82]No, I need to sleep.
[129:18.26]You just got ratioed.
[129:23.25]I got ratioed?
[129:29.50]Oh, man.
[129:30.86]No, I didn't.
[129:34.68]Let me see if I get this correct.
[129:36.33]When somebody says you've been ratioed, that means that there's more, like, dislikes than there are comments or something?
[129:45.57]What does it mean?
[129:48.07]Or there's, like, more... What does it mean?

[130:39.32]They're saying that in the Mantendo conference on the 25th during the Playcon Festival, they're going to present a new console that will revolutionize the video game sector.
[130:50.13]There's also rumor that a few chosen people will be able to get the console during the conference.
[130:53.79]Can you imagine being one of the first to upload videos on the new console?
[130:57.47]You have to go to that conference no matter what.
[131:01.57]I can't.
[131:01.85]I don't have any money.
[131:04.75]Only Bronze League level YouTubers can attend.
[131:09.65]You can move up the YouTuber ranking by getting followers, so now you know you need to get these followers before the 25th day.
[131:17.68]By the way, look around the city for any posters advertising the Mantendo Conference and upload an InstaLife photo or record a video next to it.

[158:30.99]What's the difference?
[158:37.16]Okay.
[158:42.17]Okay.
[158:51.80]Dumbbell sports.
[158:55.82]Right there.
[159:33.17]Whoa!
[159:37.46]Is this the subscriber special?
[159:39.46]I want to do push-ups.
[159:43.26]He liked that, alright.
[159:45.72]How do you do push-ups?
[160:02.95]Nice, okay.
[160:03.43]Alright, people like it.
[160:26.82]I just got a bunch of subs for this.
[160:37.09]You know, I often get letters from admirers, but today a super intense letter from someone called Tiburcio arrived, asking me to return to boxing.
[160:47.25]What's strange is that it has the Elite Fitness Club seal on it.
[160:50.34]I think Tiburcio is the real name of that stuck-up guy who works here.
[160:54.56]Boos or Roos, or something like that.
[161:01.12]Alright, well, I want to do push-ups, so how do I do that?
[161:08.92]Where do you do push-ups?
[161:20.13]On the ground.
[161:22.27]On the floor.
[161:22.85]Yeah, but I couldn't do them.
[161:23.95]Can I do anything out here?
[161:30.23]Alright, well, I obviously can't.
[161:36.17]So what's the goal here?
[161:44.47]Just do a stretch.
[161:51.60]I saw on Insta Live that the fire serpent boxer might be coming back to fight.
[161:55.50]That chick rocks.
[161:57.34]Fire serpent.
[161:59.82]Take a picture and then do a push-up.
[162:05.52]There's no push-up pose.
[162:12.63]Okay.
[162:18.78]Who's this?
[162:20.43]Gigi?
[162:22.15]I'm Gigi Macarone.
[162:24.11]Haven't you heard of me?
[162:24.89]Um... Not even your own grandmother knows who you are.
[162:32.22]Yes.
[162:33.06]Uh, yeah.
[162:33.46]I don't know.
[162:34.88]Whatever.
[162:35.38]Go away now.
[162:36.12]Shoo.
[162:38.43]The eSports bar.
[162:49.60]What can I do in here?
[162:50.14]Is this to start push-ups?
[162:57.47]Drink a coffee?
[163:04.65]I couldn't even get it.
[163:06.90]Refreshing.
[163:38.65]What do you got?
[163:39.25]A burrito?
[163:39.79]A mom witch?
[163:49.39]I can't buy any of this stuff.
[163:50.89]I need to save money.
[163:59.90]What is an e-sports bar?
[164:01.36]I don't know.
[164:01.72]Alright, I need... I need a wizard.
[164:17.87]I'm looking for PewDiePie.
[164:20.73]Right?
[164:20.95]Isn't that what I'm supposed to be looking for?
[164:22.59]PewDiePie?
[164:23.68]Like, find him.
[164:24.36]Downtown.
[164:27.68]Is this technically downtown?
[164:38.37]It's a different city.
[164:39.21]Is that PewDiePie?
[164:45.64]There he is.
[164:46.22]Oh my god, it's PewDiePie and his little dog Maya.
[164:49.26]Is there something better to endorse your work?
[164:52.10]Is this voice acted?
[164:52.82]Oh.
[164:56.54]That would be funny if it was.
[164:58.85]Endorse?
[164:59.23]A very suspicious guy was offering access to cyberware this morning.
[165:02.11]People are going nuts about this and it looks really bad.
[165:04.59]Has he offered it to you?
[165:11.96]Yes, but I need the support of a super YouTuber.
[165:14.73]Yes, but I need the endorsement to access it.
[165:16.71]This one.
[165:19.77]I have an idea.
[165:21.53]Take a signed photo of me so he sees we know each other and gives you access to the game.
[165:27.78]Your drone will let me know when you have it.
[165:29.94]Let's go to your house.
[165:30.84]We'll record a video together and find something.
[165:36.35]This is kind of just like the dream, I think, of a lot of young people, I think, that may have watched PewDiePie in the past, maybe.
[165:44.69]Where, hey, let's make a video at your house, and your camera, and you play your game.
[165:50.44]This is kind of, um... This is, uh, well... I feel like this is a dream come true for a lot of people.
[166:01.68]Okay, Maya will take me to where you live.
[166:04.44]She's got an incredible sense of smell.
[166:05.76]What do you think?
[166:06.32]Your dog can find my address by smelling?
[166:12.75]Imagine turning this down.
[166:16.49]No, no, no, no, no thanks.
[166:18.35]Perhaps another time.
[166:21.03]Yes, come to my place and record the video.
[166:22.73]Great idea.
[166:23.13]We'll record at my house.
[166:31.32]I guess we're doing this.
[166:33.42]Go and get the game.
[166:34.18]I'll be waiting for you at your house.
[166:35.54]Alright, this is a weird picture.
[166:40.97]This is the picture that sits on like a casket.
[166:46.13]What is this weird just framed photo with the thing in the back?
[166:49.69]This is weird.
[166:54.47]I thought I was gonna get like a poster.
[167:00.44]I have to bring it to that guy?
[167:01.70]I don't even know where that guy was.
[167:07.54]He was in the other city, wasn't he?
[167:22.36]He's down at the port, right.
[167:29.13]You have to take a picture with this.
[167:30.37]Oh my god.
[167:31.07]Oh no, I'm just gonna stay up all night.
[167:33.61]Because I definitely have to take a picture with this.
[167:37.49]It looks like the portrait of a communist leader.
[167:39.73]I wonder how many YouTubers are in this game.
[167:59.29]Or is it just PewDiePie?
[168:00.55]Is there a bunch of people in this game?
[168:03.97]I'm actually very curious.
[168:05.17]I'm very intrigued.
[168:16.84]Okay, look.
[168:18.18]I have this.
[168:19.04]Take a look.
[168:20.72]See?
[168:22.52]Wow, what do you got there?
[168:23.28]A photo of PewDiePie himself?
[168:24.81]This really is an endorsement.
[168:28.57]Is it really, though?
[168:29.29]I mean, you really deserve to try the game.
[168:32.40]Here's your cyberware.
[168:37.54]Searching for a famous YouTuber.
[168:38.88]Completed.
[168:39.26]Alright, cool.
[168:40.60]Did I get it?
[168:42.60]I got it.
[168:43.48]Cyberware.
[168:49.02]Why is cyberware just watch cats?
[168:51.14]Is it the same game, but a different... I don't get it.
[168:52.78]This is worth $5,000?
[169:01.10]Run, PewDiePie.
[169:02.46]Oh, I thought it was like PewDiePie is coming after me.
[169:05.52]Run, PewDiePie is behind you.
[169:14.04]I can't wait.
[169:14.52]This is going to be so fun.
[169:20.81]But it's 10 o'clock.
[169:22.31]I don't think I can do it.
[169:28.22]Do not call PewDiePie at 5 a.m.
[169:30.80]Should that be the video we make?
[169:40.93]But it's just, he's actually just there.
[169:42.31]Alright, I gotta go home quick.
[169:54.73]Is he just, is he actually just gonna be in the house?
[170:00.17]Oh my god, you got the game.
[170:01.05]I'm wondering what we'll find when we play.
[170:02.75]Let's record that video.
[170:05.83]Alright.
[170:06.15]I feel like I would want to clean my whole house four times before he came over.
[170:12.68]You know what I mean?
[170:13.30]Like... Okay.
[170:19.88]Record video?
[170:23.52]Watch cats.
[170:24.30]No, I don't have it.
[170:25.47]Oh yeah, I do.
[170:30.05]It is the same game.
[170:36.70]Okay, cyberware.
[170:40.34]Is he going to be in the video?
[170:43.62]I switch the camera to make sure that PewDiePie is in the frame.
[170:45.62]Running out of energy.
[171:01.96]Come on, gameplay.
[171:05.29]You start and... Is PewDiePie watching me make this video?
[171:09.67]You greet the channel.
[171:10.53]There's a lot of pressure here.
[171:13.93]While the game loads, you make a technical comment.
[171:21.07]Oh, there's a graphics glitch.
[171:23.63]Gotta laugh it up.
[171:28.00]To finish, you sign off.
[171:31.47]That's a five star video and I did that in front of PewDiePie.
[171:37.15]He's just standing.
[171:40.63]Alright, now here's where the funny part of this would come in.
[171:43.23]PewDiePie says, Thanks a lot.
[171:44.60]I'll invoice you.
[171:46.36]And there's an invoice in the mailbox.
[171:48.18]In like a month or two.
[171:49.94]That's like five grand.
[171:55.44]Does PewDiePie help me edit it?
[171:57.21]This game is so boring.
[171:58.29]Is this the hit game everyone's talking about?
[171:59.73]It's so short and there's nothing to do.
[172:04.08]Oh, wait.
[172:04.92]You got a strange message on InstaLife.
[172:09.01]This is very shady.
[172:09.95]PewDiePie is a whiz with videos.
[172:11.71]He'll know what we should do.
[172:12.95]PewDiePie, what do we do?
[172:15.61]PewDiePie is a top video maker.
[172:17.95]He will know what to do.
[172:21.00]What do we do?
[172:21.36]Have you recorded the video yet?
[172:24.46]I haven't told you the most interesting bit about all this.
[172:26.86]If you send a stream of messages to all your contacts praising this amazing game, we'll give you a hundred coins.
[172:37.13]I don't have any contacts, so this is perfect.
[172:40.01]Yes, I'll do it.
[172:41.01]I don't have one person in my phone.
[172:43.79]Sure, let's go.
[172:45.77]Thank- I'll do it immediately.
[172:51.81]Your face looks full of questions.
[172:53.41]Shoot, how may I help?
[172:56.56]The salesman asked us to spam a- They'll give us a hundred coins if we spam our fans.
[173:01.88]I knew it.
[173:02.34]They want to promote a crappy product by using YouTubers who take cheap bribes.
[173:07.04]You have to enter the message thread, so that with your talent as a YouTuber, you can report the scam.
[173:12.38]First, we have to catch this sales guy, wherever he is.
[173:14.64]Do you know where to look?
[173:19.12]It's probably in the port neighborhood.
[173:21.77]Almost, but not quite.
[173:23.77]Maya has tracked down the salesman, and he is downtown.
[173:27.11]Okay.
[173:29.11]We'll catch the scammer.
[173:30.17]You'll see.
[173:30.57]I have to go and look for Maya first, but I'll see you there.
[173:44.09]Oh, I do.
[173:44.79]Wait, I added all these people on my phone?
[173:46.29]I don't remember getting all these people's numbers.
[174:01.39]Alright, I want to see if there's any YouTubers here.
[174:05.33]Come on.
[174:10.01]There are definitely other YouTubers hidden in here.
[174:12.63]We have to find them.
[174:18.50]Okay, uh, it seems like Maya found the salesman in an alleyway with stairs.
[174:28.46]I have to go to sleep, man.
[174:29.30]It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
[174:37.38]Did I not upload the video with PewDiePie?
[174:45.19]I didn't upload it.
[174:48.33]Oh, Clara's trending.
[174:50.92]Suspected of being a werewolf.
[174:57.58]What's that?
[174:58.10]Is it a bird?
[174:58.80]Is it a plane?
[174:59.36]No, it's a new photo of my favorite influencer.
[175:02.86]You have an internal monolog with Doge.
[175:06.92]Alright, hold on.
[175:07.46]I need to... I have that video, man.
[175:09.18]It's gonna be worth a lot.
[175:11.06]Let's go.
[175:12.82]Start here.
[175:20.11]That's pretty good.
[175:22.53]Okay, so PewDiePie's here.
[175:25.82]He's blocked out!
[175:28.32]Why did he cut his face out?
[175:31.64]Is he not even in the video?
[175:53.82]I feel like that's enough, right?
[175:55.46]That's enough.
[175:56.14]I don't need anything else.
[175:58.54]Alright, almost broke 100.
[176:11.83]What?
[176:12.21]Why is PewDiePie not on there?
[176:13.63]What's going on?
[176:16.39]What?
[176:18.01]He wasn't even in the video.
[176:23.14]Wait, I swear he was in my house.
[176:25.36]I swear to God he was in my house.
[176:26.64]He was in my living room.
[176:28.64]Okay, yeah, PewDiePie came.
[176:30.11]PewDiePie, you're telling me that PewDiePie met you on the street, gave you a signed picture of his face to use as a currency to get a scam video game so he could come over your house and make a video and now you're on a detective adventure with him.
[176:42.04]Is that what you're saying to me?
[176:43.96]Yes.
[176:45.10]Okay.
[176:46.26]I think you need a little bit more sleep.
[176:58.10]It said that suspected of being a werewolf has been seen around downtown neighborhood.
[177:03.50]Okay, we need to get... We need to be in downtown.
[177:09.00]We're gonna find people that are werewolves?
[177:12.51]Is PewDiePie in the room with us right now?
[177:17.09]Don't forget that PewDiePie is waiting for you in this neighborhood.
[177:19.19]But where?
[177:19.63]In an alleyway?
[177:28.78]Okay.
[177:34.06]In an alley.
[177:36.48]Not that one.
[177:40.94]I can't believe you've been playing this game for more than three hours.
[177:46.59]I mean, I'm kind of invested at this point.
[177:48.21]I'm very intrigued.
[177:50.85]Where is he?
[177:52.39]There he is.
[177:52.69]Alright.
[177:54.39]Listen, cyberware is a four-slice pizza.
[177:58.37]I love pizza, GG.
[178:01.71]And two slices are for me.
[178:03.73]Too much pizza, don't you think?
[178:04.95]I'm doing all the hard work.
[178:10.32]That's how GG Macaron does business.
[178:12.76]Is this evil?
[178:14.82]Fine, two cyberware slices for you then.
[178:16.82]What the hell are you talking about?
[178:20.67]I forgot I was naked.
[178:21.39]Hey, you came!
[178:23.00]Maya found the salesperson, and look, we caught him red-handed doing business with GG Macaron.
[178:30.30]The two together are less trustworthy than an orc in an elevator.
[178:36.94]Is the implication there that the orc is going to fart in the elevator really, really loud?
[178:40.16]Or that we're going to get attacked in the elevator by the orc?
[178:47.34]Let's record a video to report the scam live.
[178:52.08]Yeah, let's do that.
[178:53.60]PewDiePie, make sure you're heading the frame a little higher.
[178:56.08]Start streaming.
[179:00.66]PewDiePie, come over here.
[179:01.86]PewDiePie, come stand over here for a second.
[179:04.92]PewDiePie, come stand over here.
[179:05.96]They're not going to believe that that's your dog if you don't come over here.
[179:15.05]Streaming.
[179:17.05]ranking these are streamers I'm live oh shit okay um what is that what is this arrow keys I'm doing alright
[179:46.55]How to wait for the funny bits of the stream?
[179:57.74]Can I suggest a topic?
[179:59.06]How many viewers do I have?
[179:59.84]4,000!
[180:00.06]Oh my god, it's not over!
[180:02.16]I thought it was over!
[180:11.37]Save this video.
[180:19.72]They caught me, dough-handed.
[180:21.50]At least I've got other pizzas to eat.
[180:26.56]Oh no, you got me.
[180:29.64]Darn it, you exposed our scam when I was about to become loaded with money.
[180:34.47]If it weren't for you and that meddling dog, you've ruined Cyberware, my Cyberware.
[180:41.37]Oh, Cyberware, how will I get money without you?
[180:48.85]Let me call the police.
[180:51.59]Team, the plan was a success.
[180:52.67]Have you seen your channel?
[180:53.79]There's a flood of messages to thank you for reporting the scam.
[180:57.76]You're a star.
[181:00.02]Thanks for not scamming your subscribers to get money.
[181:03.66]When you're a YouTuber and so many people watch your videos, you have to be aware of how important the things you say and do are.
[181:10.08]I knew I could trust you to expose this problem.
[181:12.03]I have to go now, but a surprise is waiting for you at home.
[181:21.03]End the cyberware scam.
[181:26.79]Let out a whoa, bro.
[181:29.42]Wow, David, you're such a hero.
[181:30.86]Your courage is inspiring.
[181:32.26]How many followers do I have now?
[181:38.56]12,000 likes?
[181:43.27]I gotta capitalize on this right now.
[182:17.01]There it is.
[182:21.63]And to think that I was so close to uploading a cyberware video.
[182:24.39]David, on behalf of all the YouTubers in the world, thank you.

[182:58.45]Okay, I'm going to PlayCon ticket.
[183:06.91]Didn't I just upload my cyberware video?
[183:09.17]I did because I had PewDiePie in it.
[183:10.49]And I thought that would be kind of a big deal.
[183:24.05]You gotta take a picture with it first.
[183:25.31]Oh, wait a minute.
[183:32.82]No, no, no, no, no.
[183:33.52]What the hell?
[183:57.76]Alright, put this away.

[186:01.08]I'm gonna go to sleep and come to the convention tomorrow.
[186:09.17]I can't put a shirt on because I don't have any money.
[186:11.89]Um, okay, hold on.
[186:13.85]There's a package I need to get.
[186:17.31]What was the package?
[186:18.25]Whatever, I don't care.
[186:31.08]You have shirts in your closet?
[186:33.16]Wait, I have a gift from PewDiePie.
[186:36.53]What a great adventure we've had together.
[186:37.93]We unmasked a dark, scamming network.
[186:39.95]It's been epic, thanks to you.
[186:41.83]New Tube City is a fair city.
[186:43.63]We will never forget you.
[186:44.85]Your friends, PewDiePie and Maya.
[186:46.13]This is a mural.
[186:57.95]I need it in the camera's view.
[186:59.11]Otherwise, no one will ever believe me.
[187:04.76]Can't put it against the wall?
[187:12.11]Can I just put it as my backdrop?
[187:13.31]God damn it.
[187:17.07]I want to... I'm moving the bed.
[187:30.90]I'm moving all this shit because I need to make sure that's in the... Bed gamer?
[187:38.59]Bed gamer?
[187:40.77]No, I need people to prove that he actually was over here.
[187:53.89]Doing that with WASD hurts.
[187:55.02]Oh, there we go.
[188:08.92]Never mind.
[188:20.76]Here we go.
[188:32.48]Now I can actually move it back over here.
[188:42.53]Done.

[188:48.17]Ban that person for a day.
[188:53.08]Honestly, how dare you tell me to play a game that's really fun?
[188:56.28]That's really, really awesome.
[188:58.40]Some of the best, most wonderful gameplay ever.
[189:02.08]To distract me, because now I want to play that.
[189:05.08]That's a huge, huge problem for me right now, I think.
[189:07.29]Alright, should I make a video before going to bed?
[189:11.97]No, I'll go to bed.
[189:23.24]That's it?

[190:05.40]I'm going to have to get clout for this one.
[190:17.56]You know what I mean?
[190:53.65]That's it?
[191:06.06]I'm stuck here forever.
[191:07.98]I think I can sleep in the bed, I think.
[191:12.42]Yeah, we're good.
[191:26.33]Yeah, I missed a trend.
[191:27.35]Oh, come the fuck on.
[191:32.25]What the hell?

[192:34.16]I couldn't see.
[192:34.98]I was going to do booger fuel.
[192:52.58]Cancel, cancel, cancel.
[192:57.47]If I move the bed,
[193:28.38]How do I move the furniture?
[193:33.32]What if I move it like a little bit over here?
[193:35.74]Oh, got it.
[193:36.30]Nice.
[193:36.54]Okay.
[193:40.00]I'm afraid to sleep again.

[194:46.61]Oh, okay.
[194:48.33]I gotta go to the convention.
[194:54.48]It's pretty self-explanatory.
[194:58.18]Maybe not, though.

[197:10.55]I'm 10 days early?
[197:11.91]But there are people in here.
[197:20.30]It's not a one day ticket, is it?
[197:21.58]Oh, let's get that family friendly, please.
[197:58.23]More time to stream the ass buffet.
[198:05.23]Okay, well, let's go back and make a video on what exactly?

[198:43.31]Bye.
[198:45.41]Uh... I've been told that you're getting on well with your neighbors.
[198:49.79]That's the spirit.
[198:51.67]Did you know you can see them all on the contacts app?
[198:55.09]It has a camera on me.
[198:57.88]Yes, I knew that.
[198:59.48]Perfect.

[199:07.99]Alright, I need food, first of all.
[199:10.47]And then I'm going to do... I'm going to get a video of this race.
[199:15.27]Whatever it was.

[199:19.62]What is it?
[199:20.50]Grand Cars Race.
[199:21.58]Because that's trending right now.

[199:41.18]Alright.
[199:42.58]Crispy noodles.
[199:44.71]And... Hopefully none of this costs money to get in.
[199:57.88]I'm assuming the race is over there.
[200:01.48]It's the one city we haven't been to.
[200:11.41]Yuck, green smoothie.
[200:14.85]I don't know who's making your green smoothies, but it's not me.

[201:14.47]What the hell is all this?
[201:15.49]You can buy a drone?
[201:16.81]You can buy a lightsaber.
[201:25.10]This is not a lightsaber.
[201:26.12]This is... Wipe your enemy's memories so they forget why they hate you.
[201:31.24]Only then will you be able to reconnect with them.
[201:37.51]No thanks.
[201:45.38]What did I play?
[201:45.98]I just wasted energy doing that.
[202:03.09]So if it's a video game, then you tell me, can I just buy it from the video game store?
[202:08.65]God damn it.
[202:11.37]Well, I'm going back.

[213:14.07]Closed on Sundays.
[213:16.89]Are they open?
[213:17.69]Is Leadpoint open on Sundays?
[213:18.95]Why is everything closed on Sundays?
[213:31.48]Because it's a Christian game.
[213:32.84]This reminds me of like trying to buy alcohol on Sundays in Massachusetts.
[213:37.06]Okay.
[213:44.77]We're gonna give... We have to work with what we can.
[213:48.35]Watch cats people still think is cool.

[213:56.08]To start the video...
[213:59.18]I'm going to shyly say hello.
[214:00.46]It's Valentine's Day, right?
[214:01.40]We're going to be like, oh, hey, hi, guys.
[214:05.28]You forgot the script.
[214:07.69]Just skip that part.
[214:08.87]We're just like winging it.
[214:09.71]Why does everything suck so much?
[214:13.89]Let out a bro.
[214:14.63]They're in-game purchases, but you look it up on the wiki.
[214:23.16]Why is this video so bad?

[215:04.05]Wait, what are you doing?
[215:08.84]It's me sitting in my room.
[215:14.70]This one looks like shit.
[215:17.26]What's wrong with this one?
[215:19.15]Warning, you can't monetize this clip.
[215:20.89]Your video won't generate profit, although it will definitely get loads of views.
[215:26.66]Huh?
[215:27.50]Why not?
[215:30.76]This sucks.
[215:36.51]I don't care.

[218:58.21]Developer day.
[218:59.15]Where is that?
[219:04.28]Hey, David, I heard they're having a developer day in the Player One store.
[219:07.39]Famous developer in the industry will be presenting his new video game there and people can try it out while live streaming.
[219:13.07]Don't miss it.
[219:13.47]You have to know how to live stream to get the game.
[219:17.72]I'm fine.

[219:19.94]I was getting antsy.

[219:42.06]Fountain's down here, right?
[219:43.07]Alright, here we go.
[219:52.19]That fountain.
[220:17.64]Blue, cool, calming, crisp waters of our beautiful downtown city.

[221:05.84]That's a quality four star video.
[221:12.94]Doesn't matter.
[221:13.38]I don't even need to upload it.
[221:14.26]I just got it for that guy that wants the fountain stuff.
[221:18.94]This video got removed due to copyright.
[221:24.04]Well, I got the followers.
[221:24.95]I don't care.
[221:25.29]Can I do that again?
[221:36.70]Got it.
[222:18.25]Alright.
[222:31.99]1,500 likes, that's not bad.
[222:37.90]You didn't use hashtag fountain.
[222:40.08]Oh shit, you're right, I didn't.
[222:51.39]Alright, so now... Didn't I... Oh, I have to make the video.
[222:56.09]Alright, I have to actually upload it.
[222:58.76]Then I'll go buy a shirt finally, I promise.
[223:00.60]Where do I want to go?
[223:03.14]Back to the house?
[223:04.12]Yeah.
[223:08.70]What?
[223:08.86]I'm not even... Okay, whatever.
[223:19.43]And then it's developer day, so I have to go there too.
[223:21.47]Actually, let's go there right now.
[223:22.77]Do I have enough energy to actually do anything?
[223:29.62]Let me eat first.
[223:40.93]Vague posting.
[223:53.00]Okay, let's do crispy noodles.
[223:57.65]I need some of those.
[223:58.81]I'll eat the crispy noodles.
[224:00.97]Thank you.
[224:02.73]He's taking the game too seriously.
[224:04.41]I want to get to 5,000 subs before I end this stream.
[224:09.51]It's important.
[224:09.97]I still have a little bit of time to put that video up.
[224:22.71]Developer Day.
[224:25.39]I just found the channel.
[224:26.13]Are you the almond and radish guy?
[224:27.95]I'm one of those.
[224:28.49]Alright, Developer Day.
[224:30.72]Where's the developer?
[224:32.06]Are you a developer?
[224:34.12]Hi, I'm Stuart Lee, the designer of Spider Bro.
[224:36.84]I'm presenting it two days before it goes on sale.
[224:40.10]If you want to try it out, you'll have to live stream it on the console.
[224:42.70]Do you know how to live stream?
[224:44.05]Of course I do.
[224:45.91]Well, I don't think your drone has the streaming function.
[224:48.39]So why don't you go over to the console and give it a try?
[224:52.14]And then I'll explain how you can install this function.
[224:55.12]Streaming.
[224:55.48]Go over to the console and try it out.
[224:57.90]And then I'll explain how you can install this function on your drone.
[225:04.31]Okay.
[225:04.99]Developer day.
[225:05.57]Spider bro.
[225:06.23]A lot of trending shit here.
[225:07.85]Alright, this is the rhythm game.
[225:13.47]I'm live.
[225:18.49]That person has 3.9 million concurrent viewers.
[225:22.99]How is that?
[225:23.65]How many people is that actually?
[225:24.76]That's insane.
[225:54.35]What the fuck is going on?
[225:55.61]Oh, okay.
[225:56.43]I'm good.
[226:00.63]Is this what it's like to stream?
[226:03.79]Um... Sometimes it can feel like that.
[226:12.02]I should just stream again.
[226:15.40]Yeah, that was $150.
[226:16.04]It's way better than NewTube.
[226:16.96]Let's go.
[226:37.46]And I get access to the game early.
[226:39.30]I'm gonna do this as many times as I can before I pass out.
[226:59.15]Alright, good.
[227:02.25]Hell yeah.
[227:03.45]$150.
[227:04.07]Save that one too.
[227:04.59]I'm gonna upload like five of these videos.
[227:07.27]You're super funny.
[227:07.89]Eat a bunch of takeout and do it again.
[227:21.60]No space available.
[227:25.18]Okay, whatever.
[227:26.14]Can I get a selfie with you?
[227:32.77]Developer day.
[227:50.33]alright I got that now I gotta turn the videos in oh I'm running out of time seven hours
[228:21.99]What are your thoughts on, um... I don't know what that is.
[228:25.35]I refuse to even say it out loud.
[228:28.15]Talk to the dev?
[228:29.33]I did.
[228:29.79]Oh, shit.
[228:30.63]I just played the game and left.
[228:32.55]That's rude.
[228:32.81]You're right.
[228:33.26]Oh, they're closed now.
[228:42.68]They closed three hours ago and I was still in there.
[228:44.62]Exclusive.
[228:45.14]Come on.
[228:45.38]I'm a tuber.
[228:45.94]I get exclusive, uh, access.
[228:58.68]I got three videos to make.
[228:59.66]I'm going to be pulling an all-nighter on this one.
[229:06.83]Alright.
[229:08.53]Edit video.
[229:11.01]I have the streams, the vlog in front of the fountain.
[229:13.51]Let's get that one done now.
[229:22.88]What?
[229:23.04]Are you kidding me?
[229:31.72]Are you serious?
[229:39.00]I don't care.
[229:39.50]This is like a sponsored video.
[229:41.36]This guy paid me to make this.
[229:42.48]I don't care.
[229:42.78]There you go.
[230:06.18]Alright, they liked it.
[230:11.74]I'll take my... I got 1,200 bucks now.
[230:14.23]I could probably buy something.
[230:16.97]Alright, let's go again.
[230:18.19]I still have a takeout.
[230:20.07]Pulling an all-nighter here.
[230:23.71]Come on, Gwen, let's go.
[230:28.24]This was a better... This was the best stream.
[230:29.68]This was the developer day.
[230:30.70]This is trending.
[230:31.48]This is huge.
[230:36.04]Um... None of these fit together.
[230:59.23]When is second David gonna come up?
[231:04.13]Whatever.
[231:05.03]It's trending.
[231:07.13]Yeah, I gotta get my hands in there.
[231:11.47]The biggest game stream pro of adventure.
[231:37.51]Go.
[231:42.41]Come on, more.
[231:47.99]Good.
[231:51.87]When is Davidcraft?
[231:55.07]Someday soon.
[231:55.51]Alright, I have two of those.
[231:56.26]Can I put it together?
[231:58.26]Do I have enough energy?
[231:59.02]Damn it.
[232:01.78]Alright.
[232:02.76]Let's go to bed.
[232:03.22]Wake up.
[232:09.77]1k, 2k, 2k, 3k, come on.
[232:17.23]Buy some better editing?
[232:18.23]That's not a bad idea.
[232:19.17]We'll try that now.
[232:23.58]Did one of those get copyright claimed?
[232:28.06]You have to buy a live streaming function in ER tech.
[232:32.04]Okay.
[232:37.11]Something you would have already solved if you'd gone streaming with Stuart Lee yesterday, but who am I to judge?
[232:41.51]Didn't I?
[232:45.05]What?
[232:45.91]I'm editing the videos from those streams.
[232:49.31]What are you talking about?
[232:52.40]What?
[233:02.14]Install editor.
[233:02.88]Increase the score for the clip.
[233:04.64]Complete all output connections.
[233:07.67]Complete all input connections.
[233:11.28]Increase the editor?
[233:16.54]That was a thousand bucks?
[233:18.70]It's gone.
[233:19.48]Is it gone?
[233:20.04]What's happening right now?
[233:26.73]Oh.
[233:39.30]Okay, this is really confusing.
[233:40.68]Alright, so you can put it on each individual clip, but you only have a certain amount of render points.
[233:45.92]I get it.
[233:51.46]So I can do it to one.
[233:52.94]We'll do it to this one.
[233:53.52]Okay, publish.
[234:03.93]Developer Day secrets revealed.
[234:08.06]On Honey Play Studios 1, the end will make you roll on the floor laughing.
[234:11.03]Sure.
[234:21.92]Now I will go buy a shirt.
[234:26.44]But I already... Okay, I guess we didn't do this.

[235:17.24]So how am I supposed to do this?
[235:26.08]Find the E-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-
[235:37.86]er what this is not that much views I got like 3k yesterday what's going on here where's that er tech place other side of town yeah alright let's go get some clothes at least a t-shirt
[236:15.67]Magic Pixels t-shirt.
[236:19.93]Emoji shirt.
[236:24.03]Salamander sweatshirt?
[236:25.01]How about the emoji shirt?
[236:26.96]Yeah.
[236:28.38]Put it on.
[236:36.00]How do I put it on?
[236:36.64]What?
[236:39.38]What does it say?
[236:40.18]Immortal snail.
[236:41.30]I keep saying... Oh, the immortal snail.
[236:42.78]The immortal snail, dude.
[236:43.70]I don't know what you...
[236:45.27]What's the immortal snail?
[236:55.09]It's a TikTok thing?
[236:56.39]Okay.
[237:10.00]Spider bro still a thing?
[237:12.28]How is that not a thing?
[237:21.57]Alright, I need to go this way.
[237:28.45]You and a snail both get immortality and a million dollars.
[237:32.27]But the snail is always coming... Wait, but the snail is always coming towards you and if it touches you, you die.
[237:43.12]I can't... I can't crush... I can't just kill the snail.
[237:48.72]The snail is immortal.
[237:49.68]If I touch it with anything, it kills me.
[237:58.78]Well, you would have to just kind of hire a bunch of scientists to come up with how long it would actually take the snail to go from one coast of the United States to the other coast.
[238:13.54]And that's a very simple question to answer.
[238:16.82]Because what you would do is if you had a million dollars, right?
[238:21.02]I get a million bucks.
[238:22.90]I would just buy or rent two properties at the same time.
[238:26.90]One in California and one in like Florida or Massachusetts or like Maine or something, right?
[238:34.45]And we would determine how long it took the snail to go back and forth.
[238:38.85]And let's say it was like 20 years.
[238:42.36]It's going to be like 10 to 20 years for the snail, maybe more for the snail to do that.
[238:46.70]So you would just go live in your California house for 10 years.
[238:51.36]And then once it became like eight and a half years, just to make sure you got it right, about nine years, you just go live in the other house for like two or three years, like 20 years.
[238:58.48]You would just keep going back and forth.
[239:08.13]That's easy.
[239:09.30]It would probably take a snail 30 plus years to go that far.
[239:15.08]Whenever you sleep, you don't dream.
[239:16.40]You just see whatever the snail sees at that time.
[239:18.36]Well, that would be awful.
[239:25.18]One million's not enough for that.
[239:29.76]I wouldn't buy a house in California then.
[239:31.51]I don't know.
[239:32.33]Somewhere cheaper.
[239:36.75]Just put it in a box.
[239:37.87]Well, it could get out of the box.
[239:38.91]If you go across the whole country, there's no way a snail can find you that fast.
[239:48.82]What if you got on a plane?
[239:50.58]Does the snail have intelligence?
[239:52.14]Or is this just a snail just walks in a straight line across the continent of the United States?
[239:58.72]Does the snail have intelligence?
[240:00.44]It knows.
[240:00.96]It knows to, like, get on a plane and go on somebody's luggage and get on the plane from Boston to LA.
[240:07.36]Does it have that intelligence?
[240:10.89]It is.
[240:11.23]Yes.
[240:11.73]Okay.
[240:13.43]It's hyper-intelligent.
[240:16.61]Um... Okay.
[240:24.47]In that case, I would just probably...
[240:27.02]I don't know, hire.
[240:27.82]You have a million dollars, so I would hire somebody to be at every entrance of my house.
[240:33.14]Or wherever it was.
[240:35.06]And just to stay there, and if they see a snail, it doesn't kill them, right?
[240:39.23]So they would just pick it up and get on a plane.
[240:42.19]But why don't they just pick it up and put it, like, keep it as a pet or something?
[240:52.01]Pause the game?
[240:52.63]Oh, shit, whatever.
[240:55.61]Can you keep, okay, what if you like, get a box that's a glass box, and you put lettuce in a little enclosure, and it's nice and comfortable, big enough where it's comfortable, and you'll just keep the snail in there.
[241:10.81]That's, why would that be hard?
[241:19.50]Nine to nine, shit.
[241:22.60]Alright, well now I can't do anything.
[241:23.82]Because I still said this.
[241:25.60]Doing nothing.
[241:32.37]Put down a salt circle.
[241:35.65]Well, that... No, because it's an immortal snail.
[241:38.75]That's not going to work.
[241:53.20]Cover the snail in concrete.
[241:57.73]Yeah, but you'd... I don't know.
[241:58.77]I feel like you'd have to put it in concrete.
[242:01.39]Put it in the ground.
[242:02.35]Alright, I'm just walking back and forth.
[242:05.61]I'm not doing anything.
[242:06.29]I need to go back to the house.
[242:09.05]Yeah, is it immortal or invincible?
[242:10.33]That's a good question.
[242:18.70]Where's my fucking house?
[242:31.08]I don't think that would be hard to do.
[242:32.86]Especially considering that I would just set up motion detectors in the house.
[242:39.95]Right?
[242:40.11]So it would sense any movement at all in any of the rooms.
[242:44.79]So I would be awoken by an alarm sound.
[242:48.31]And if I see the snail just slowly coming towards me, I'm gonna... There he is.
[243:03.79]It's too slow to get noticed?
[243:13.03]Just do the TikTok video already.
[243:20.69]What does that mean?
[243:21.23]Does that mean I have the lady talk for the first five seconds?
[243:29.92]How would you deal with a snail coming at you?
[243:34.27]Seems to be a huge threat in New Tube City.
[243:36.01]Go to the fisherman to find out more.
[243:37.23]If you don't remember where it is, look it up on the map.
[243:45.79]This life is on fire.
[243:48.35]What?
[243:48.51]You don't check your messages?
[243:55.72]Beware, I'm near the fisherman and the tide has risen so high the pier is in danger.
[244:01.96]Hey, bad day for surfing.
[244:02.82]The sea is roaring.
[244:04.17]Are we in a scenario where we're getting... What's happening right now?
[244:13.53]What is Craner?
[244:14.34]Are we about to get, like, attacked?
[244:20.72]What is it talking about?
[244:22.76]Are we going to get attacked by water?
[244:25.13]What does it mean?
[244:25.87]Like a storm?
[244:31.63]It's the snail.
[244:33.61]What about Craner?
[244:34.47]It's the most popular.
[244:35.21]What is Craner?
[244:35.83]Alright, I need to go down.
[244:42.49]First thing is first.
[244:44.77]What was I doing?
[244:45.57]When is this open from the 7th to the... This is not open.
[244:51.46]It's about to be closed.
[244:56.50]Alright, we gotta go to the beach.
[244:59.78]Which is a subway.
[245:13.93]Okay.
[245:15.73]Oh my god, it really is.
[245:16.77]Beware, I'm near the fisherman and the tide has risen.
[245:23.56]Fisherman?
[245:24.06]Alright, the fisherman.
[245:33.52]What the hell is going on down here?
[245:44.97]tide is coming in?
[245:45.96]It doesn't look like it.

[245:53.10]Are you doing a hurricane vlog?
[246:06.67]Sunbathe.
[246:12.45]Sunbathing in a hurricane?
[246:19.83]He's getting so many likes.
[246:21.25]Um, what am I supposed to do?
[246:28.97]Down by the fishermen.
[246:31.05]So, over here.
[246:31.63]Okay.
[246:45.90]That blonde boy might be able to tell you what is happening.
[246:51.39]He's got a weird voice.
[246:54.51]Where am I?
[246:54.91]What am I doing here?
[246:55.55]I feel like I have some kind of troll inside my head.
[246:57.21]I can't even remember my name.
[246:58.15]I used to create videos, you know.
[247:00.96]Trainer.
[247:02.22]That's all I know.
[247:04.50]And that I was you.
[247:05.72]A you-you.
[247:06.98]A YouTuber.
[247:10.20]You're a YouTuber.
[247:11.08]Good.
[247:11.30]This gives me an idea.
[247:12.90]If you record a video with him, it might help him recover his memory.
[247:15.66]This way, he will be able to tell us what happened to the Tide this morning.
[247:26.30]What?
[247:26.58]This is like an explosion over here.
[247:33.77]Start recording.
[247:35.29]Okay, um... If this was real, I would say... I'd be full of energy.
[247:40.52]I'd be pretty much panicking at this.
[247:42.84]Your phone rings.
[247:43.58]You can't get any peace.
[247:46.54]I mean, I would say... I would just probably laugh about that.
[247:49.24]Like, who's calling me?
[247:50.04]I don't know.
[247:51.28]You thank your followers for the support.
[247:53.30]And you have an internal monolog.
[247:55.56]Okay?
[247:59.24]You spam your insta-life.
[248:01.09]No.
[248:03.01]I'd sign off.
[248:06.61]What happened to the camera?
[248:14.37]I can do it better than that.
[248:20.23]Who the fuck is this?
[248:20.75]Is this too many- Is there another person in the- You're running out of energy.
[248:25.96]What?!

[248:41.79]Is this a restaurant?
[248:52.02]This is still trending.
[248:52.90]I have to get it.
[248:53.50]But while it's still trending, I'm not going to screw this up.

[250:54.75]Where am I?
[250:55.15]Oh, wrong.
[251:04.78]I'm trying to get a picture of him.
[251:05.92]Oh, never mind.
[251:06.88]I'm trying to get a picture of him across the way.
[251:20.43]Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.
[251:22.07]That's all my content.
[251:26.03]Well, some of it.
[251:31.37]Alright, I'm back.
[251:31.81]Alright, let's try this again.
[251:35.07]Let's go.
[251:40.78]That's better.
[251:41.16]Let's do it.
[251:45.06]You start.
[251:46.82]And I'm going to greet the channel.
[251:49.64]Good start.
[251:51.22]The neighbor's dog is barking.
[251:52.52]That's okay.
[251:55.66]Bad.
[251:57.78]Poltergeist appears and I flatter myself.
[252:02.21]This is worse than the last one.
[252:04.61]Spammed my Instagram.
[252:13.95]God damn it.
[252:15.81]I don't care.
[252:18.42]I thought something happened to him.
[252:19.44]That just scared the shit out of me.
[252:22.22]I heard like a firing, like a shot.
[252:25.66]I remember everything.
[252:26.32]That was fucking terrifying.
[252:27.34]That was so loud.
[252:28.22]Now I remember something savage happened this morning.
[252:32.42]I was recording an epic video when suddenly the sea turned into a swirling portal.
[252:38.05]Gosh, it swallowed me up and then spat me out on the dock of the city.
[252:41.59]In the morning I heard that a certain Captain Vane, the fisherman's owner, is repairing an old boat.
[252:46.61]Can you convince him to lend it to me?
[252:49.72]If I sail out to sea, I can jump into the whirlpool.
[252:51.52]This will close the portal.
[252:53.50]I will return to my dimension and the danger for New Tube City will be over.
[252:57.24]Can I get a selfie?
[253:03.60]Let me get a selfie real quick.
[253:07.65]Let me get a selfie real quick.
[253:10.65]Come on.

[253:32.42]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[253:36.10]Yeah, I'm a little tired.
[253:37.54]Fuck.
[253:40.24]Ah, fucking.
[253:44.24]Imagine like you were in class.
[253:47.52]Like, fucking such a slow filler word.
[253:51.42]It's so easy to do.
[253:53.88]And you're, like, in class at, like, college or high school or something, and your teacher was like, Yeah, so we got, um, if you take a look at the algorithm on the board here, it's 4 or 5x, and then you're solving for, uh, fucking y, which will get you to the answer which we're looking to see here.
[254:09.33]Uh, Chris, can you give me an answer here?
[254:18.04]I don't know, fucking... I do that all the time.
[254:21.48]What's my favorite cereal?
[254:22.68]Cap'n Crunch!
[254:23.24]That's not what you asked.
[254:23.92]What's my favorite hotel chain?
[254:26.92]One that has more than three stars on Yelp.
[254:30.84]I refuse to stay in any others.
[254:32.00]Okay, let's go.

[254:58.38]Any hotel that is less than three stars on Google is... I don't want to stay there.
[255:06.58]Where am I going?
[255:08.14]Over here.
[255:13.92]most hotels are over three stars and I'm look I'm not talking about the hotel ratings right oh it's a four star hotel it's a five star hotel I'm talking about actual reviews of these places you could be a four star hotel and have a three on yelp right I'm talking about just the reviews
[255:38.09]You could be at like a Holiday Inn, and the thing could be a 4.5 on Google, right?
[255:45.03]I'm not talking about the actual quality of the hotel.
[255:51.37]I'm saying if it's not at least 3 on Google, I don't want to go there.
[255:58.24]Now I gotta finish this video.

[271:55.91]God damn it.
[272:05.38]It's misspelled.
[272:06.57]What the fuck was that?
[272:07.31]It's misspelled!
[272:08.15]I was doing an extreme overreaction.
[272:16.97]Oh my god, I found a typo.
[272:26.88]That's pretty rich coming from you.
[272:28.04]That's my point.
[272:28.92]Who cares?
[272:40.02]Everything you do is in it.
[272:40.92]Where's the restaurant where I have the VIP punch card?
[272:51.09]It's almost time to go to the convention.
[272:58.21]Subway.
[272:58.67]We're going to do the boat thing.
[272:59.97]I can't afford to buy the streaming thing.
[273:03.61]It's $2,000.
[273:03.93]I don't have enough.
[273:12.61]This way.
[273:12.91]Do you have a TikTok?
[273:17.29]No.
[273:18.27]But I guarantee you if I did, I'd be huge.
[273:29.60]Not this again.
[273:30.18]No, I'm serious.
[273:30.84]Like, I would be the biggest thing on... I would have 500 million subscribers on TikTok.
[273:34.25]TikTok.
[273:44.61]Alright, I need to find this boat.
[273:46.81]A boat thing or whatever.
[273:51.33]Convince somebody to let him use his boat.
[273:56.01]Somebody posted your ass on TikTok and it got 50,000 likes.
[273:59.00]Okay.
[274:00.66]You don't think that I could come up with something?
[274:09.30]We're talking about me here.
[274:11.36]One of the most coordinated... Ow, my fucking hand.
[274:18.75]That would be huge.
[274:19.57]That would have gotten like 100 million views.
[274:21.11]Alright, settle down.
[274:32.62]I bought an NFT of your ass.
[274:37.87]It's not official.
[274:38.47]How do I get to this fucking thing?
[274:44.49]I'm trying to... This boat?
[274:46.61]I have to convince this guy to let him use his boat.
[274:54.86]A minimum gold league level is required?
[274:57.36]I can't use a ladder?
[275:00.26]I have to... One of these boats, I have to convince somebody to let... Zane!
[275:05.85]Yeah?
[275:07.39]Hi.
[275:08.81]I'm Zane.
[275:17.44]I got you a retro game.
[275:20.92]I'll give it to my friend, Joy.
[275:22.16]No!
[275:22.44]You're going to re-gift it immediately?
[275:24.48]Hold on.
[275:25.40]You can't do that.
[275:27.92]Don't tell me you're going to re-gift it.
[275:29.29]That's one of the only copies of that game they had.
[275:38.31]There are plenty of other people to speak to in the neighborhood, you know.
[275:43.76]Go fry some asparagus.
[275:48.72]Oh, you suck.
[275:57.35]Okay.
[275:58.01]House of June.
[276:01.75]Where... I need a... Whose boat do I need?
[276:03.47]DJ Cerulean.
[276:05.42]I recently arrived in town.
[276:07.66]You're a YouTuber and a great future awaits you.
[276:09.58]How do you know that?
[276:12.08]I'm good at reading people.
[276:12.82]My name is Cerulean.
[276:13.56]Cerulean.
[276:18.25]You know, I can see you're a good person, but I didn't come here to make friends.
[276:20.52]Do you guys see this guy's boat anywhere that I have to convince?
[276:31.65]I don't understand.
[276:40.19]What is it?
[276:40.83]Remind me again what's going on.
[276:41.73]Right.
[276:49.09]Raynor needs to repair Old Captain's Veins.
[276:53.01]Old Captain Vein's boat.
[276:56.78]Who's Captain Vein?
[277:11.77]Is it listed on one of these?
[277:23.52]No.
[277:30.21]What the fuck?
[277:31.49]It's 4 AO- Wait, am I actually gonna get pass out?
[277:34.49]I hit my head on the bar.
[277:41.87]What happens?
[278:00.75]Last night you fell asleep in the street.
[278:02.11]Do I always have to go around looking out for you?
[278:04.91]Check that nothing has been stolen from your backpack.
[278:06.89]I didn't have anything.
[278:08.53]From now on, remember to return home before 4 a.m.
[278:10.57]Uh-oh.
[278:14.25]I've been watching your videos and I have to say you have to do something with this place.
[278:18.72]Room decor and even the clothes you wear influence how your followers react.
[278:22.30]They'll like your videos more if you decorate your home in your own style.
[278:25.74]Tried that, Xavier.
[278:27.08]Tried that.
[278:28.26]And it became a thing that everybody made fun of.
[278:31.88]I put a lot of work into the Reddit shelf back here and I showed them.
[278:35.38]And they made fun of me for a month straight.
[278:39.13]So I don't know where you're getting your information, but it's outdated.
[278:41.45]Okay, I have an Amazon app on my phone now.
[278:50.15]Where is it?
[278:57.04]I can buy anything I want on Amazon.
[279:03.90]What do we got?
[279:08.79]Oh, wait.
[279:09.19]I can just order?
[279:09.81]This is so much better.
[279:12.07]Okay, nice.
[279:19.15]This is a thousand times better.
[279:24.80]Ram cookie?
[279:25.52]I can build a PC.
[279:31.62]It's amazing on not Amazon.
[279:35.90]Right.
[279:36.08]Okay.
[279:40.48]Um.
[279:42.60]I still don't understand this captain shit.
[279:44.15]I'm just going to go to sleep for two days.
[279:45.31]Okay.
[280:02.83]Silent the raccoon is huge.
[280:04.05]What's it for?
[280:09.48]It's a privilege to have me as a follower.
[280:11.04]If you don't upload anything, you're going to end up with an unfollow, my friend.
[280:14.58]Appreciate the feedback.
[280:28.79]Okay.
[280:33.21]What is Silent the Raccoon?
[280:38.76]I don't.
[280:43.40]Uh, Silent the Raccoon.
[280:47.47]Oh, what is it?
[280:50.31]Must be a retro game or something, right?
[280:51.93]Damn it.
[280:59.88]Shit.
[281:09.67]Retro game.
[281:10.69]Yeah, but I don't... Consoles are hard to get.
[281:26.32]Go to the fisherman's store?
[281:28.56]I will.
[281:28.76]Let me just see if I can get this console.
[281:33.58]They have Silent the Raccoon.
[281:34.64]And I can get it.
[281:51.10]Come here.
[281:51.40]Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[282:01.69]Where is that little stall?
[282:04.85]Where is this shit?
[282:07.07]Come on. Sound out the raccoon.
[282:10.47]Oh and it's for the Zega MaxDrive?
[282:15.47]Oh my god buy it.
[282:21.57]Oh my goodness, what is this?
[282:22.39]I'm out.
[282:27.83]What's trending today besides that?
[282:29.60]Dancing challenge, Easter, and gameplay.
[282:33.24]This could be the biggest video I've ever made.
[282:34.98]Alright, dancing challenge.
[282:36.00]I gotta find that.
[282:38.90]Is this a dancing challenge?
[282:45.18]Nope.
[282:45.74]It's the mayor.
[282:56.93]Dancing challenge.
[283:01.47]Nope.
[283:06.49]Nope.
[283:06.69]It's probably in the... I don't know.
[283:13.17]Is it easy vote for worst stream?
[283:14.60]I don't know.
[283:15.10]What are you talking about?
[283:17.68]I just burped really hard down deep in my body.
[283:20.24]What are you... We already went over this.
[283:26.45]You can't... Worst stream does not mean I don't like the game.
[283:29.29]Yeah, I could name you probably three or four streams this year that were way worse.
[283:44.73]I'm having fun.
[283:45.67]I'm having a good time.
[283:46.35]I'm having a blast, actually.
[283:47.37]This is actually really fun.
[283:49.93]I'm having a ton of fun.
[283:51.35]How dare you, by the way?
[283:52.77]How dare you?
[283:59.07]Alright, where am I going?
[284:02.27]I have the console.
[284:03.17]I need to find the dancing competition.
[284:11.30]I would imagine that would be right in the middle of downtown.
[284:17.22]Is this a dancing competition out here?
[284:18.78]This looks like dancing, but it doesn't look like a competition to me.
[284:31.57]Oh, I don't even care.
[284:32.15]I'm just gonna make the video.
[284:37.16]Dollhouse streams are worse than this?
[284:49.44]Alright, I have the console.
[284:50.78]Let's do it.
[284:53.79]Take that down.
[284:55.57]One, two, let's go.
[285:01.07]We're doing a gameplay video of Silent the Raccoon.
[285:04.55]See if we can get this trending.
[285:15.05]Let out a whoa.
[285:18.25]Find a bug.
[285:20.03]Make a technical comment about the bug.
[285:22.46]Why is this not filling up at all?
[285:25.80]This is literally a zero video.
[285:29.28]What?
[285:33.36]One star video?
[285:34.26]Why is this filling so slowly?
[285:38.40]Serious?
[285:52.91]It's too many cuts.
[285:57.27]This is going to be demonetized.
[285:58.59]I just won't use that one.
[285:59.37]Whatever.
[286:06.10]Just clickbait, who cares?
[286:40.11]If I ever, okay, 150 dislikes, that's just, that's, that was all, I thought that was really bad when I was making YouTube videos.
[286:52.80]If a video had more than 1 to 200 dislikes, because there was always going to be
[287:00.28]30 to 50 guaranteed dislikes no matter what.
[287:03.54]It was nothing I could do about it.
[287:05.02]It was just guaranteed, right?
[287:06.64]But if a video had more than 150 dislikes, 200 dislikes, that means that there were people that actually really did not like that video.
[287:17.71]And whenever I would see that happen, I would have an internal crisis where I'd sit there and be like, what the fuck did I do wrong?
[287:23.13]What do I do to fix this?
[287:24.71]Was it bad?
[287:25.49]Maybe I'll do another video tomorrow and make up for it.
[287:34.24]Thank god you can't dislike a stream.
[287:37.79]Thank goodness.
[287:38.53]Alright, the convention's today.
[287:48.57]That's 6k views though.
[287:57.19]Finally.
[288:00.56]Layer 1.
[288:04.57]Wait, it's the 22nd, right?
[288:06.21]I was watching a mouse fight with a piece of cheese on YouTube today and it was more fun than watching you do a gameplay, buddy.
[288:14.56]This same person is just seriously like, leave me alone.
[288:17.50]What did I do to you?
[288:18.32]Like, what the hell?
[288:21.18]It's the buddy.
[288:28.19]I'm just trying to do as good a job as I can with what I have.
[288:33.17]I'm trying.
[288:40.81]I was watching mice fight each other on YouTube.
[288:42.63]Yeah, what the hell is- what are you talking about?
[288:43.91]What's wrong with you?
[288:48.39]Can I finally go to the convention?
[288:52.92]Here we are.
[288:53.28]We made it.
[288:54.32]Finally!
[289:02.34]Okay.
[289:03.54]Buttered popcorn.
[289:05.64]Pop Mars popcorn.
[289:07.70]Caramel popcorn.
[289:09.08]Nice.
[289:10.95]We're here.
[289:11.25]We're at the convention.
[289:16.47]Who's this guy?
[289:17.97]We gotta get a vlog here.
[289:24.03]Who am I interviewing?
[289:30.51]Let out a bro.
[289:31.71]Why am I so mad?
[289:41.34]These videos are awful.
[289:42.63]Why have I not leveled up my interview yet?
[289:46.96]Whatever.
[289:47.16]I'm going to get like 10 videos from this.
[290:29.48]Here we go.
[290:35.18]Alright.
[290:36.04]What do we look at first?
[290:45.91]There it is.
[290:46.19]Start PlayCon.
[290:47.25]Oh, wait.
[290:47.63]This is a keynote.
[290:52.39]Start the PlayCon.
[290:53.43]Alright.
[290:53.89]Let's start it.
[291:00.13]I feel like we're about to get red nursery rhymes.
[291:02.52]Is this a gaming convention?
[291:11.98]Nobody liked that one.
[291:18.56]Uh, who's this?
[291:20.88]Maya Mato.
[291:22.08]Hello, welcome to Playcon.
[291:23.00]I'm a genius developer and I know some of this convention's secrets.
[291:26.37]Yeah, I would love some secrets.
[291:29.33]You have to reply correctly to one question.
[291:32.27]In which year did I publish my first Super Strike Brothers game?
[291:35.49]83?
[291:39.32]Oh, 87.
[291:39.44]I think it's 83.
[291:41.82]Wasn't Mario in...
[291:55.27]What's it called?
[291:55.75]Wrecking Crew?
[292:00.33]Wait, not the character Mario.
[292:01.65]When is the... Mario was 87.
[292:02.59]Yeah.
[292:02.91]I'm sorry.
[292:08.69]Your answer was wrong.
[292:13.48]Wasn't Mario 87?
[292:14.04]Regular Nintendo?
[292:14.52]It wasn't 78.
[292:14.94]It wasn't 83.
[292:15.16]The regular Nintendo came out in 85. 84.
[292:27.78]Yeah, Mario is not 83.
[292:33.16]Ask me again.
[292:36.50]I'd love to hear a secret.
[292:37.86]Okay, well... Correct!
[292:42.24]I'll tell you the first secret.
[292:43.76]Look for a violet-colored plant.
[292:46.12]It looks like the plants in my game.
[292:48.81]If you post a photo of it on InstaLife, I'll give you a present that's very special to me.
[292:52.49]You're looking for a purple plant?
[293:03.22]Purple plant.
[293:03.84]There it is.
[293:04.20]Found it.
[293:31.69]Got it.
[293:34.51]Alright, so now what else can I do here?
[293:40.83]What's this?
[293:41.29]Press to start.
[293:43.23]Can I play?
[293:46.47]Oh, hell yeah.
[294:00.23]Uh, how about Dom?
[294:13.65]Talk to him again.
[294:15.73]This is, yeah, this is military tech?
[294:20.01]Take this present.
[294:21.79]From now on, you'll have part of my wisdom.
[294:23.59]And you'll be able to make videos from the tutorial script.
[294:28.93]Wait.
[294:31.29]You have my present now.
[294:32.05]Enjoy the convention.
[294:32.83]Alright, how do I put this away?
[294:38.23]What's in here?
[294:40.17]Conferences 23, 24, and 25.
[294:40.98]Closed.
[294:51.17]Who are these people?
[294:53.79]Who are you?
[294:56.63]Who are you?
[294:57.01]Who are these people?
[295:00.91]OK.
[295:13.20]I want to do this one.
[295:49.70]I'm looking forward to trying out all the games, but I don't know if I'll have time for them all.
[295:55.64]Real tweet.
[295:58.08]Stop doing that pose.
[295:59.48]I can't... This is the one thing that looks... I like it.
[296:03.60]Sorry, you need the VIP pass to get into this private room, of course.
[296:08.00]You need to be a Gold- So these are Gold League YouTubers?
[296:10.56]This must be awful to stand like there.
[296:18.65]Like this the whole time.
[296:23.83]Can I sneak over there and get a vlog?
[296:25.77]There's a place to film.
[296:33.58]Human Zoo?
[297:03.80]Okay.
[297:06.12]Alright, let's go make a tutorial.
[297:08.14]I'm going to talk about my experience at Playcon.
[297:13.81]Wait.
[297:18.05]No, fuck doing an interview.
[297:27.40]Now we're going to go do a tutorial on that trending game.
[297:43.01]Yeah, that was 500 coins.
[297:44.77]It was way too expensive.
[297:50.52]Five hours?
[297:51.16]So, the plan is... Let me get the plan going up here into Halloween.
[297:58.35]So, here's what we're going to do.
[298:01.47]So, tomorrow, Talonx and I were talking about playing that Man of Medan game.
[298:08.75]We were like, there's a couple things we were thinking about playing, but that's one of them on the list.
[298:12.48]Either that or something else, we'll figure it out.
[298:15.94]There is one scenario where there might not be a stream tomorrow, and I'm going to give you, it's probably like a 5% chance.
[298:23.91]I'll tell you what it is.
[298:25.59]I just started taking an antibiotic.
[298:26.63]Antibiotic.
[298:29.63]I don't know if it's gonna make me feel like shit.
[298:31.93]We'll find out.
[298:33.45]But, we'll see.
[298:35.35]So, um, it hates streaming.
[298:40.26]It's a 100% chance.
[298:41.88]No.
[298:43.76]Alright, plan on there being no stream tomorrow because when there is, I get to say there was one, okay?
[298:50.64]Do not mix it with avocados.
[298:52.18]I'm not eating avocados.
[298:53.04]What are you talking about?
[298:55.65]Oh, but anyways.
[298:57.29]Darkest Dungeon 2 comes out.
[298:59.84]Like, in a couple days.
[299:01.50]We're going to play that on Friday.
[299:03.36]And then Saturday, we're going to do Public Domain Movie Night 2.
[299:06.93]The day before Halloween.
[299:11.03]So, there's probably going to be a stream tomorrow.
[299:12.59]Me and Etalyx are going to play something.
[299:14.90]We'll see.
[299:17.26]Again, I'm on an antibiotic.
[299:19.27]Last time I took an antibiotic, I had diarrhea.
[299:21.87]And I'm just telling you, let's be honest.
[299:23.37]I don't care how many people are here watching.
[299:25.13]I'm very honest.
[299:27.11]Incredibly honest person.
[299:34.23]How much longer do you think I should stream?
[299:43.66]Why am I asking you that?
[299:45.44]Why am I asking?
[299:46.10]Let me get to top 50.
[299:47.37]Let me get to top 50.
[299:48.09]I don't know why I thought that was so funny.
[300:02.29]Main Tendo next.
[300:05.22]When I get to top 50 YouTuber, I'm done.
[300:09.36]Checking out InstaLife and seeing that you posted a new photo is the best.
[300:12.06]You're too good. 100.
[300:13.87]Hey, thanks.
[300:16.58]I got some footage to edit.
[300:30.53]No, just throw this one away.
[300:31.87]Just toss this video.
[300:33.23]There's smoke coming from your computer.
[300:34.81]This doesn't look good.
[300:36.63]You should change that part to continue using the computer.
[300:38.73]What?
[300:45.81]I'm done.
[300:49.78]See you guys probably tomorrow.
[300:52.22]See you guys tomorrow.
[300:53.78]Have a great night.
[301:02.74]30-90.
[301:04.66]No, actually, it's been pretty good so far.
[301:08.99]Yeah.
[301:09.57]We'll see tomorrow.
[301:10.33]Look, if there's an event where I have to not stream because of this stupid antibiotic, then that's what's going to happen.
[301:15.71]But it's planned for tomorrow.
[301:16.79]We're going to do something tomorrow.
[301:18.27]Keep an eye on the sus tomorrow.
[301:20.24]I think that's pretty much all I want out of this game.
[301:21.74]It was fun.
[301:27.04]It means you're too weak.
[301:29.52]No, I'm not too weak.
[301:31.20]I had a good time.
[301:31.70]I thought that was actually really funny.
[301:32.66]Why are your streams not in 1080p?
[301:36.52]Well, it's got
[301:39.81]Depth, bitrate.
[301:44.23]Not enough.
[301:45.33]Twitch.
[301:46.95]Skip.
[301:47.35]That's why.
[301:58.58]You should eat yogurt or take a probiotic to help with diarrhea.
[302:03.40]Uh, yeah.
[302:06.60]Actually have a probiotic.
[302:14.78]That wasn't a sarcastic yeah.
[302:16.32]That was a yeah, I have a probiotic right here.
[302:19.46]Not right here.
[302:20.02]That makes it sound like I made that up.
[302:21.86]There's a probiotic I have available to me that I'm taking.
[302:27.57]Are these old people problems?
[302:31.35]Well, they're currently me problems right now.
[302:35.24]Do you guys remember before the Dollhouse stream?
[302:37.30]I want some streamer insight here before we go.
[302:42.68]The day before I had to get on the plane, I had to get an MRI of my brain.
[302:50.64]It was incredibly stressful.
[302:52.40]Because I had this weird pressure to my head.
[302:57.64]And I was really dizzy.
[302:58.66]And kind of like uneasy feeling.
[303:01.96]I talked about it a little bit when I came back.
[303:04.48]But
[303:07.34]It was a really, really awful thing to have happen right in the middle of that project.
[303:13.68]So that was a really, really, really... TL;DR, but I don't want to get into it.
[303:20.27]I have this problem in my sinuses.
[303:23.63]I have cysts in my sinus.
[303:26.87]I think they're in both of them.
[303:28.13]The maxill... We already talked about it.
[303:30.23]You know.
[303:31.72]So, it looks like I have a little bit of an infection up there.
[303:35.69]So, we're going to do an antibiotic for the infection and see if anything else has to happen.
[303:41.71]I am completely fine, by the way.
[303:43.45]Like, I'm fine.
[303:44.29]Don't worry.
[303:45.81]It's just an annoyance that happened a month or two ago.
[303:50.71]I'm good.
[303:51.27]Don't worry.
[303:51.75]I'm 100% fine.
[303:58.45]And I'm not even sure if that's exactly what's going on, but that is what is being investigated now.
[304:04.67]So, again, I'm completely fine.
[304:07.70]I'm 100% healthy right now.
[304:10.08]Don't worry.
[304:12.02]Thanks for the subs, by the way.
[304:22.04]That was a good time.
[304:23.36]YouTuber's life, too.
[304:26.09]Currently on Steam, if you care.
[304:28.27]We got to hang out with PewDiePie, which was pretty cool.
[304:37.24]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[304:38.72]We'll see you probably tomorrow.
[304:39.64]Keep an eye on the sus.
[304:59.13]you
[305:34.01]you
[306:15.16]Credits, MonkaS.
[306:15.90]Didn't I run them?
[306:19.36]I thought, yeah, I ran them.
[306:20.68]I did the credits.
[306:24.32]Yeah, I did.
[306:24.74]Alright.
[306:30.63]Is this the part where I scream and then hit the end screen button?
[306:32.69]Alright, let's try it.
[306:35.19]I really wanna try to get cut off.
[306:37.40]See if I can get cut off mid-sentence or something.
