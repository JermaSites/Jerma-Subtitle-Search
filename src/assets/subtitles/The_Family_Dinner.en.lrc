[00:27.80]You're probably wondering, what's the deal here?
[00:31.68]Got a table set up here at a fire in my dining room.
[00:35.31]Let me just make sure that's set up there.
[00:41.77]Well, what's going to happen is my family's coming over.
[00:44.73]We typically do an Easter celebration, and they all come by.
[00:50.19]It's my year to host it, and I've been trying really, really hard to make sure everything is set according to plan.
[00:56.82]So I don't know when they're going to show up.
[00:59.28]I haven't seen a lot of these people in a long time.
[01:01.84]My brothers are coming.
[01:04.14]My grandparents are coming.
[01:05.82]My grandfather's coming.
[01:07.46]So if you're probably wondering where I've been, but the stream is late.
[01:12.21]You try setting up a table.
[01:13.55]You try bringing in all these chairs into your fucking living room.
[01:16.47]You know how nervous I am right now?
[01:18.91]I'm streaming this to you guys right now.
[01:21.97]Everyone always asks me, Jerma, oh, I want to know about your family.
[01:24.87]I want to know more about you.
[01:25.83]Please tell me more.
[01:27.71]This is a fucking nerve-wracking mess for me right now.
[01:31.49]But I'm gonna, I'm for transparency and for openness.
[01:37.70]Sarah Licks, it's not pre-recorded.
[01:39.72]It's not.
[01:40.66]This is real.
[01:41.58]This is actually happening right now.
[01:44.11]I don't know.
[01:44.39]You want me to prove it?
[01:45.13]I can prove it.
[01:45.75]Look.
[01:47.19]Cup on the shoe on the pre-recorded head.
[01:50.49]Everyone's spamming it right now.
[01:51.87]I know you are.
[01:52.67]And I can prove it to you as many times as I want.
[01:56.99]I just don't know when anybody's going to get here.
[01:58.33]I've been thinking about this for like three weeks now.
[02:02.90]I got all these new plates and these utensils.
[02:10.45]I fucking hate my brother.
[02:15.09]But I'm probably going to see him.
[02:16.74]I didn't want him to come, but he got an open invitation.
[02:19.16]I'm speaking very candidly with you guys right now because obviously there's going to be a lot of people here.
[02:24.60]So how am I supposed to do that?
[02:26.44]How am I supposed to open myself up to you guys on a daily basis?
[02:29.79]It's hard as a streamer.
[02:31.65]It's hard as a tuber.
[02:32.55]You know what I'm saying?
[02:36.82]I don't even know what time it is.
[02:37.66]I told them to come at like 7, 7.15.
[02:38.46]Who knows when they're all going to like trickle in.
[02:43.38]But I got, this is spiked juice.
[02:46.49]I think there's vodka in here.
[02:50.25]I don't even know.
[02:50.91]I bought it from the store.
[02:53.05]But not like that matters.
[02:55.65]The cider spider, it's live.
[02:57.20]What are you talking about?
[02:58.42]Is that how I'm supposed to prove it?
[03:00.24]My chat that I can see over here?
[03:01.84]That I can see everything you're saying?
[03:13.29]I made these cocktails myself.
[03:16.47]Just need to wait for someone to show up.
[03:20.67]Bear with me here, guys, for a minute.
[03:21.93]This is kind of... I need a minute.
[03:25.99]Hey, Mom.
[03:27.15]Mom, what's up, Mom?
[03:28.91]Dad!
[03:30.29]Great to see you.
[03:32.81]Is that a new suit?
[03:35.38]Mom, is that a new suit?
[03:36.20]No, that's Dad's suit.
[03:40.30]You still work at the dump?
[03:42.60]Yeah.
[03:48.89]I like the tie.
[03:50.40]It's a good tie.
[03:53.44]It's 7.18 p.m.
[03:54.20]Yes, it is.
[03:56.16]It's exactly 7.18 p.m.
[04:00.26]I have ambient music playing and shit.
[04:06.20]I think I can pull on it.
[04:07.76]Did I just see the car?
[04:10.37]I see a car pulling.
[04:15.63]I think that's somebody coming in right now.
[04:20.73]Just play it cool.
[04:21.83]Here they come.
[04:32.65]Just a minute, hold on.
[04:37.60]The door, come on, the door's open.
[04:39.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:40.26]Hi.
[04:40.44]Mom, come on in.
[04:41.96]Hi.
[04:42.36]Oh, hi.
[04:43.60]How are you?
[04:44.80]Dad, come on in.
[04:46.14]What's this?
[04:47.50]This, just don't worry about any of this.
[04:48.69]This is just, I just set it up there for, you know, I'm a streamer.
[04:51.73]I'm a YouTuber, you know.
[04:53.71]Oh, that's your internet stuff?
[04:55.87]Yeah, it's just the internet thing, whatever it is.
[04:57.69]Are you filming this?
[04:58.99]No, I mean, did you want me to film?
[05:01.08]Yes, no.
[05:01.72]I mean, yeah.
[05:02.94]Just take a seat anywhere you want.
[05:04.36]Anywhere you can go is fine.
[05:06.82]Hey, what's up?
[05:07.74]Hey, nice looking table, honey.
[05:09.88]Good job.
[05:10.10]They'll be here probably in a little bit.
[05:11.66]How was the drive?
[05:15.11]Not too bad.
[05:16.01]Not too bad?
[05:16.67]No, you know, the traffic's over now and the roads are clear.
[05:19.79]There's no more snow.
[05:20.87]When was the last time it snowed?
[05:23.43]Was it like last week?
[05:24.51]Last week, yeah.
[05:27.05]I like the suit.
[05:27.81]It's a good suit, Deb.
[05:29.75]Thank you.
[05:30.85]Somebody threw it away at the dump.
[05:32.88]You still at the dump?
[05:34.06]Of course I'm still at the dump.
[05:35.33]Yeah, yeah.
[05:35.75]Why would I ever leave that job?
[05:37.81]Gold mine.
[05:38.29]Every day I get to go and dig for buried treasure.
[05:40.43]Oh, yeah, and he sure does, and he brings it all home.
[05:44.57]Any new dump stuff you got?
[05:45.76]Are you planning on bringing the plates back after we use them?
[05:49.28]Couldn't take the stickers off?
[05:51.06]Hey, come on.
[05:52.72]I don't have much time.
[05:54.94]I should be happy he has plates, yes.
[05:57.26]Yes, I should.
[05:58.26]I didn't have very much time because I obviously... You only had a year.
[06:01.91]You only knew about this last year, I know.
[06:03.75]It's tough to schedule that in.
[06:09.21]Nothing in that one.
[06:10.65]Yeah, I just, I didn't know it was going to be me this year.
[06:12.93]I thought usually we go to Grandpa Gus's.
[06:15.41]But apparently not Grandpa Gus's this year.
[06:17.23]I thought it was him.
[06:18.25]No, honey, it's you, dear.
[06:20.13]You know, we always go last.
[06:21.35]Last Easter, we sat around the table and we talked about this and we decided it was you.
[06:25.77]Yeah.
[06:26.41]Yeah.
[06:26.70]So, you know.
[06:27.94]I must have been playing Minecraft or something.
[06:30.38]I must not have been paying attention.
[06:32.29]But no, it's great to see you.
[06:33.23]Wait for everybody else to come.
[06:34.85]I invited a lot of people to show up.
[06:37.35]That's my main concern.
[06:38.33]Is they going to come or not?
[06:39.33]You know what I mean?
[06:39.84]Oh yeah, everybody will be here.
[06:41.66]Have you talked to them?
[06:42.66]Dylan?
[06:44.28]Danny?
[06:44.58]Have you talked to Dylan or Danny?
[06:46.59]Well, I talked to Dylan, yeah, and I know he was planning on coming.
[06:50.95]Okay.
[06:51.61]I mean, I want to see my boys.
[06:53.01]I don't get to see my boys all the time, the three of you together.
[06:56.67]Yeah, you get to see them.
[06:57.85]Yeah.
[06:58.25]You don't get to see me that often.
[06:59.77]It's a real treat.
[07:00.88]Yeah, you see them like probably five or ten times a year, but you see me like once a year.
[07:05.44]But that's fine.
[07:08.16]Yeah.
[07:09.30]We'd see you more often if you showed up.
[07:11.22]I mean, you know where we live, right?
[07:12.60]We have a move.
[07:14.38]I know you haven't moved, but that's on me, too.
[07:17.24]I'm kind of lazy in that regard, so I can understand.
[07:20.84]I got food.
[07:21.38]I prepared.
[07:22.16]It took me a while.
[07:22.74]What do we got?
[07:24.10]What are we eating?
[07:25.10]Should we wait?
[07:25.96]Should we eat?
[07:26.52]No, wait.
[07:26.74]We're going to wait.
[07:27.34]No, we're going to wait.
[07:28.10]We're going to wait, and we're going to all eat together as a family.
[07:30.98]That's the whole purpose of this.
[07:33.02]Grandfather bringing his kids.
[07:33.97]I told you to just walk in.
[07:34.93]I told you to just walk in.
[07:36.99]Hey, how are you?
[07:38.01]Good, Jeremy.
[07:38.71]Good to see you.
[07:39.19]How are you doing?
[07:39.67]Keep my seat warm for me.
[07:41.31]What?
[07:41.77]They're keeping my seat warm for me.
[07:43.55]You're in my spot.
[07:45.03]You know, head of the table, all that kind of thing.
[07:47.21]I guess.
[07:47.73]It's his house.
[07:48.59]It doesn't matter.
[07:49.55]No, no, Jeremy, Jeremy, move along.
[07:52.11]Your time will come.
[07:53.49]When you're 70 years old, you can sit at the end of the table.
[07:56.31]Okay.
[07:58.61]Yeah, I was just messing around.
[08:00.17]Like, that is your seat.
[08:01.30]I usually was... I was just kind of kidding around.
[08:04.34]I got up to shake your hand, Dad, but apparently... Ah, I was busy chewing out the grandkid.
[08:09.71]Sorry about that.
[08:11.73]So, how are you doing, Grandpa?
[08:15.95]Well, you know, being by myself and the dog and never getting any visitors.
[08:20.67]What kind of dog?
[08:21.13]He's kind of lonely, getting old.
[08:23.35]What kind of dog is it?
[08:24.86]It's Teddy.
[08:25.32]You know Teddy.
[08:26.76]I haven't seen him.
[08:27.54]I haven't been over there in at least six months.
[08:29.68]He's a cross.
[08:30.74]Yeah?
[08:31.12]Yeah, he's like a black golden retriever.
[08:34.46]Oh.
[08:35.24]Mixed between a retriever and a black lab.
[08:38.56]Oh, that's cool.
[08:39.46]Yeah, you don't forget that dog.
[08:40.77]He's huge.
[08:41.73]Yeah, he's filming us.
[08:43.25]He's filming us, Dad.
[08:44.61]Oh, awesome.
[08:46.63]What's this, posterity or a new project?
[08:50.51]You guys know, I don't know if you know Grandpa, but I'm a tuber.
[08:53.89]And so sometimes I do live.
[08:55.55]Yeah, I'm so proud.
[08:57.74]Yeah, I know that you guys have supported it for a long time.
[09:00.06]Yeah, be nice.
[09:01.38]Tuber.
[09:02.56]What?
[09:03.20]Something wrong with that?
[09:05.54]Just keep talking.
[09:07.80]Tuber.
[09:08.22]My son's a tuber.
[09:09.48]Yeah.
[09:10.32]So I know how I do this, and I might make a little bit more money than the guy that works at the dump, but that's fine.
[09:17.18]Hey, the guy that works at the dump paid for you to go to school.
[09:20.14]Yeah.
[09:20.94]Paid for your first car.
[09:22.12]Yeah, he did.
[09:23.28]He did alright by you.
[09:24.32]Yeah, come on.
[09:25.02]Your father did everything for you, boy.
[09:28.46]Yeah, no, I'm just saying.
[09:30.49]I want to pay you back.
[09:32.25]That's what I'm saying.
[09:32.73]That's kind of one of the reasons why I want to do this whole thing is paying you back and paying it forward.
[09:37.41]That's why I brought it up.
[09:38.09]I wasn't trying to be mean or facetious or anything, but I just want to make sure that you guys know that the car that you got me and not only the car you got me, all four years of school I'm going to pay back as well, right?
[09:50.85]Guys?
[09:52.41]Oh, hey, we got that on the internet, dear.
[09:56.47]What do you think?
[09:57.27]What do you mean on the internet?
[09:58.17]Think we're going to see that money?
[09:59.47]Yeah.
[10:04.19]Well, regardless, I'm glad to have all of you here, like the three.
[10:07.69]I haven't seen you in a while.
[10:09.08]Hope the dog's doing okay.
[10:10.84]But, um... I hope you didn't bring the dog.
[10:13.88]Did you bring the dog?
[10:14.58]Thank heavens they didn't bring the dog.
[10:16.40]Are you kidding?
[10:17.88]We need another seat at the table.
[10:19.30]I love dogs.
[10:20.06]Dogs are awesome.
[10:20.62]You can bring a dog if you want.
[10:22.08]Well, next time around.
[10:24.06]All you guys can actually come down and visit.
[10:25.95]Come on in.
[10:26.39]Come on.
[10:26.61]The door's open.
[10:27.09]Just come on in.
[10:29.57]Hey, guys.
[10:31.28]That's my dad.
[10:32.48]How are you?
[10:33.70]Give him a hand.
[10:36.62]Hi.
[10:37.14]It's so good to see you.
[10:39.18]My turn, my turn.
[10:40.54]How's the trench business?
[10:42.60]The trench business is great.
[10:43.63]Look at you.
[10:44.15]There you go.
[10:44.53]That's awesome.
[10:52.84]Jeremy, how's it going?
[10:54.06]What's all of you now?
[10:55.18]Well, I am so glad you boys came.
[10:56.78]Seriously, Jeremy?
[10:57.94]What?
[10:58.06]Still unemployed, I see.
[11:08.07]With the camera always, huh?
[11:09.85]No, I mean, well, it's... Yeah.
[11:11.17]He's a tuber.
[11:12.31]It's not Yale, but it is something, Dylan.
[11:14.67]Yeah.
[11:14.91]He's a tuber.
[11:15.61]Listen, listen.
[11:16.63]We don't want to get on him for not making that much money.
[11:19.51]No place, guys.
[11:21.39]Oh, wait, hold on.
[11:22.23]It's the latest thing these days, right, Jeremy?
[11:25.09]No, it is.
[11:25.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:25.97]But hold on.
[11:26.41]How many?
[11:26.75]One, two, three, four...
[11:28.71]I did not get you a plate.
[11:29.99]Yeah, I kind of want a plate.
[11:32.37]No, steal his.
[11:33.15]He doesn't need it.
[11:33.83]He doesn't need it.
[11:34.43]Steal his.
[11:34.93]No, wait, I need to eat, though.
[11:36.69]So, like, I have to have a plate.
[11:38.40]Dylan, go ahead and steal his.
[11:40.86]First time having a guest, I guess.
[11:42.90]Well, what's that plate there?
[11:44.26]You might as well take these, too, then.
[11:46.16]There's a plate right here, kid.
[11:49.64]Is Uncle Lou coming?
[11:50.90]Tell me he is.
[11:51.64]Oh, I hope he is.
[11:54.28]Oh, so do I. Oh, come on.
[11:56.92]He's my brother.
[11:59.42]We don't see him at all.
[12:02.30]You guys mind if I grab a drink?
[12:04.72]Actually, how I like it.
[12:06.28]What, you don't like Lou?
[12:09.25]I love Lou.
[12:09.89]He's your mother's brother.
[12:11.59]That's right.
[12:12.35]That's true.
[12:13.03]That's why you've got to say yes.
[12:14.78]No truer words have been said.
[12:16.04]He's awesome.
[12:17.92]Why does nobody like him?
[12:20.16]I'm not even going to get started.
[12:21.06]Let's just put it this way.
[12:23.02]He's very interesting.
[12:24.92]Yeah, so am I. Exactly.
[12:28.14]I don't know.
[12:28.50]He's kind of an odd duck.
[12:30.43]Well, hey, we're all related, all blood relatives.
[12:36.03]What do you think?
[12:37.65]What do you mean, maybe?
[12:38.87]I have my doubts.
[12:39.91]You don't think that we're brothers?
[12:41.39]Well, you know.
[12:42.75]Well, I was there, and I can tell you, you are all brothers.
[12:47.25]I've often wondered, what drugs do they have?
[12:50.83]And I'm the most handsome, right, man?
[12:52.71]I'm the most handsome one.
[12:53.71]Yeah, yeah, sure.
[12:54.90]Right, right.
[12:56.49]Well, let's just say we don't have any baby pictures of you, so... Of me?
[12:59.85]Of you, right, right.
[13:01.53]Not this again.
[13:02.19]This is awesome.
[13:03.63]No, wait, you have... Remember when I was with the swimmies on my arms and I was in the pool?
[13:08.38]You were 11.
[13:09.26]And you guys were holding me in there?
[13:12.54]I remember because you had your arm on my head and pushing it down into the water.
[13:16.70]It was a joke.
[13:18.30]Yeah, it was a joke.
[13:19.00]I was 11.
[13:20.40]A joke.
[13:20.82]You don't make jokes.
[13:21.44]You boys were always roughhousing all the time.
[13:25.17]I told myself that's just the way boys are.
[13:28.47]That's how boys play with each other.
[13:30.41]Right.
[13:31.73]Well, does anybody want, this is a cocktail that I made.
[13:34.09]What do you got?
[13:35.73]What is that?
[13:37.69]This is a screwdriver.
[13:39.17]Juicy juice?
[13:42.13]Where's my glass?
[13:42.91]Is this my glass?
[13:44.20]I know I don't want to swear in front of mom, but shut the fuck up, dude.
[13:46.90]Oh, come on.
[13:47.74]Be nice.
[13:48.02]It's a family dinner.
[13:49.32]Be nice.
[13:49.68]It's a family dinner, mom.
[13:51.56]Easy.
[13:54.42]Every year, I swear to God, we have all kinds of problems, and it's my year to host.
[13:59.25]Hey, why don't you try that?
[14:00.07]You'll like it, Danny.
[14:00.75]Would you like some?
[14:01.77]Yes, thank you.
[14:02.87]It is juicy juice.
[14:04.13]It's not juicy juice.
[14:05.09]It's orange juice and vodka.
[14:07.03]It's a great classic combination of alcohol.
[14:08.87]It looks like Tang.
[14:10.96]and you'll look like R2.
[14:12.14]It's a classic combination.
[14:13.14]I'm telling you.
[14:13.64]Have you ever had a screwdriver before, Gus?
[14:16.36]Yes.
[14:16.92]I like mine straight.
[14:19.16]And I see you brought your own beers.
[14:20.54]Well, you don't think you're going to provide alcohol here?
[14:22.77]You know, all of you slow down a little bit.
[14:24.55]No more vodka for me.
[14:27.03]Well, I promise it's not poison.
[14:28.13]I'm moving into the beer zone.
[14:29.41]It's not poison.
[14:30.81]It isn't poison.
[14:31.67]Sometimes I wish it was.
[14:32.77]You think I'm going to poison my family?
[14:35.41]You think I would poison my family on a live stream?
[14:37.79]Dude, we're right here.
[14:38.85]We're not up there.
[14:40.13]Yeah, but we have to... I've thought about poisoning my family.
[14:44.39]I don't know who I'm talking to, but it's crossed my mind.
[14:47.89]Maybe once or twice.
[14:48.77]Every time he comes, he tries to poison his family.
[14:50.78]I like that one.
[14:51.62]Good job, Dad.
[14:52.54]I liked it a lot.
[14:54.15]Guys, I know you always said no business at the dinner table, but I have a deal right now.
[14:56.99]I just need to get through.
[14:57.85]It's Easter weekend.
[14:59.15]I know, but if I don't do this, somebody else will.
[15:02.75]Is it Good Friday?
[15:03.47]You have to do that?
[15:04.78]Really?
[15:06.88]I mean, come on.
[15:08.38]You want to live down in Boca.
[15:10.08]We've got to make the money.
[15:10.84]Yeah, we've got to make the money.
[15:12.58]That's right.
[15:12.96]These boys here.
[15:13.92]We've got to make the money.
[15:16.60]That's right.
[15:17.28]Exactly right.
[15:18.35]What are you doing these days?
[15:20.75]I'm freelancing at Amazon, actually.
[15:23.23]Freelancing, that's what people of my generation referred to themselves as when they were unemployed.
[15:27.91]Yeah, well, you know.
[15:28.71]Well, things are different.
[15:30.74]Yeah, haha, you, haha.
[15:33.80]Michael Lou!
[15:34.14]Michael Lou, who's going to show me in?
[15:36.50]Hey, Lou!
[15:37.32]Oh, my God.
[15:37.92]Jane!
[15:38.18]You hottie!
[15:48.78]Oh, my God, it's so great to see you.
[15:50.24]I'm so glad you're here to get even this out a little bit.
[15:55.18]Thank you, Lou.
[15:56.76]Big go.
[15:57.48]Look at you.
[15:58.48]I know.
[15:58.80]How strong do I look?
[16:00.42]Michael.
[16:01.65]Oh, yeah.
[16:02.59]Michael.
[16:04.09]Yeah.
[16:04.65]My favorite uncle.
[16:05.71]OK, OK, OK.
[16:06.89]Listen, Lou, do you need a plate?
[16:08.75]Take mine.
[16:09.05]Gus.
[16:10.77]No, please take my plate.
[16:13.28]How are you boys?
[16:15.20]Danny, Dylan.
[16:17.50]It's, uh, it's to see ya.
[16:20.44]It is to see ya, mate.
[16:22.00]So, everybody's here.
[16:23.68]Awesome.
[16:24.74]Uh, yeah, I was preparing for it.
[16:27.12]I might not be the, not a five-star quality chef, as you guys know.
[16:31.61]This should be a tree, yeah.
[16:33.53]I didn't have very much time.
[16:34.85]I was late to the stream and had a year.
[16:37.89]I was late to the stream and late to setting it up.
[16:39.95]Well, I didn't have any lunch.
[16:41.06]I hope it's freaking good.
[16:42.36]Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[16:45.44]If anybody wants to have a little bit of an Easter, pre-Easter rehearsal snack here.
[16:53.54]Shopping at the food bank.
[16:55.04]What is this?
[16:56.32]Jeremy, come on.
[16:58.90]Are you serious?
[17:00.02]Oh, it's space food.
[17:02.14]Right, see?
[17:03.04]You went into this, right?
[17:04.68]We could take this into the cave.
[17:06.33]We could take this in space.
[17:07.93]Ginny, what are you talking about?
[17:12.47]I could have brought it over.
[17:14.21]We could have ordered Chinese.
[17:15.27]You know what they call it?
[17:16.43]Well, I was thinking we could do like a tomato, basil, double noodle Campbell's classic thing.
[17:21.21]Guys, call this a blunt instrument.
[17:22.95]I knew this was going to happen.
[17:24.25]Oh, doing tattoos.
[17:25.47]So I had an alternate plan.
[17:27.77]Give me a second.
[17:29.51]Wait, hold on.
[17:29.85]What do you mean, alternate plan?
[17:30.73]This is like, this is what I was going to do.
[17:31.71]They brought food.
[17:32.19]They brought real food.
[17:33.05]Deal.
[17:33.43]Did you really?
[17:34.23]Stopped by the shop earlier.
[17:35.38]Oh, wait, wait.
[17:37.24]What did you get?
[17:37.62]What did you get food?
[17:38.18]You got food from?
[17:39.36]I knew this was going to happen.
[17:40.50]I knew this was going to happen.
[17:41.96]I don't think Kansas is so cool.
[17:44.16]Oh, my God.
[17:45.02]I thought she was going to come over early and help me out with this.
[17:47.16]I didn't.
[17:47.90]Grandpa, she would have.
[17:49.42]Did you ask her?
[17:50.64]Let's get this out of here.
[17:51.69]Did you say?
[17:52.23]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:53.09]I want to keep my food.
[17:55.23]I'm going to keep my food.
[17:56.73]I am.
[17:57.05]Let me get some of that real food.
[17:59.57]Did you say, Mom, could you give me a hand?
[18:02.67]What is that, salsa?
[18:03.87]Did you bring shaved ham here?
[18:06.47]Listen, picked it up before I got here.
[18:08.43]Listen, I know you haven't changed since we were little kids.
[18:11.30]Right.
[18:12.14]I got a little bit of meatballs and salsa.
[18:15.17]You guys have graduated from college, right?
[18:20.51]Why don't you guys stick to the Jerma?
[18:24.37]You and me, I think, can get something going with this.
[18:27.80]I knew I could count on you both.
[18:29.40]Is there any fruit in here?
[18:31.86]There's no fruit in here.
[18:33.68]Fine, you want to get this out of here?
[18:34.70]Fine.
[18:35.42]You can bring your expensive.
[18:37.16]Where'd you get that from, the grocery store?
[18:39.36]Expensive grocery store ham?
[18:41.01]I got this at a Whitman's.
[18:43.65]Fine, take it away.
[18:46.21]I don't want that, because that wasn't my responsibility.
[18:51.29]It was kind of your responsibility.
[18:52.97]I should have chosen one with the pop-top.
[18:55.63]This is going to take forever.
[18:57.30]I got my hands on it.
[18:58.40]We let you host one year.
[18:59.52]One year.
[19:00.00]One year.
[19:06.46]Look, look.
[19:08.02]I was not prepared for this.
[19:10.20]I was told... See, I see you were not prepared for this.
[19:13.00]That looks so good, too.
[19:15.14]That looks so good.
[19:17.09]Thanks, Michael.
[19:18.09]Let's get something going on here.
[19:20.73]You have one job to do.
[19:22.71]It was kind of a difficult job.
[19:23.77]Boy, that's going to be trouble for you tomorrow morning, isn't it?
[19:26.33]There you go.
[19:26.93]That looks great.
[19:27.39]Alright, look.
[19:32.12]I know the food is not the best dinner we've ever had, but we're together as a family.
[19:42.71]It's Easter.
[19:43.73]We don't get to see each other.
[19:45.63]All of us, Lou and all of my boys together all at once.
[19:51.30]It's such a dream.
[19:52.80]Come on.
[19:53.97]We can be nice and just, we'll get something to eat later.
[19:58.35]Let's just have a chance to enjoy each other.
[20:02.17]But I took care of it.
[20:03.65]I knew this was going to happen.
[20:05.80]By the way, can I just be real here?
[20:07.20]Meatballs.
[20:07.80]Don't fucking come to my house and bring a bunch of meatballs.
[20:11.24]Okay, okay.
[20:11.76]Dial it back a little bit.
[20:12.68]Open invite.
[20:13.26]Your mother's sitting right here.
[20:14.50]I don't care.
[20:15.14]Watch your language.
[20:15.78]I don't fucking care.
[20:16.94]Your mother's sitting right here.
[20:19.49]This is my responsibility.
[20:20.33]If you don't like the food that I brought them, you're going to have to deal with it.
[20:22.23]I took care of it.
[20:23.19]Well, Jeremy, you didn't really bring food, did you?
[20:26.05]Boo?
[20:26.23]I mean, what are we supposed to do?
[20:27.80]You ready?
[20:28.10]We're really supposed to eat out of cans.
[20:29.86]Crack!
[20:30.32]He's been drinking again.
[20:32.04]No, he hasn't.
[20:33.04]Well, it's been 10 years.
[20:36.40]That's a fact.
[20:37.24]You know, uh... If you don't come into somebody else's house, and you bring a bunch of food that... This is a one-up show, I understand.
[20:45.95]You got a great job.
[20:46.65]You got a great job.
[20:47.57]You went to Yale.
[20:48.37]You got this freelance job.
[20:50.26]And I sit here at this side of the table.
[20:51.72]Jeremy, you don't have to always be jealous of your brothers.
[20:55.34]They did you a favor.
[20:56.72]I mean, he could be a little bit jealous.
[20:58.96]We did do pretty good.
[21:00.89]Danny, come on.
[21:02.26]Am I right?
[21:03.98]Come on.
[21:04.46]Not in front of my face.
[21:05.82]Not in front of my face.
[21:07.38]Every time.
[21:08.82]Well, that's fine.
[21:09.76]But it doesn't matter because... Listen, I could get you a job, Jeremy.
[21:12.34]Come on out.
[21:13.62]New York.
[21:14.57]Henry's an artist.
[21:16.25]Yeah.
[21:16.67]He doesn't have to be in the same field as you two.
[21:19.21]Exactly.
[21:19.53]Going for the dough all the time.
[21:21.57]No, but family... Nice to hear you say, Gus.
[21:25.79]That is nice to hear you say.
[21:27.43]What a fucking good brand, by the way.
[21:29.81]Mm.
[21:30.59]Aged perfectly, I bet, too.
[21:32.03]Yeah, it is.
[21:32.67]And that's my shit.
[21:33.61]I spent a lot of money on that.
[21:34.55]Don't bogart that can there, boy.
[21:36.51]Would you like some, Lou?
[21:37.29]Let's have a little.
[21:38.09]Take a little bit, if you will.
[21:41.11]So, on top of it being an Easter dinner, on top of that, you know.
[21:46.74]Thank you, Lou.
[21:47.64]Thank you.
[21:49.14]I will pass on the hunt sauce.
[21:50.76]Really nice suit you got there, Lou.
[21:52.62]Oh, thanks.
[21:53.06]Yeah, Michael.
[21:54.32]I got it at the dump.
[21:56.99]Oh, that's sweet.
[21:57.95]Wait, you got that at the dump, Dad?
[22:00.31]Yeah, he gets everything.
[22:01.49]Now, now.
[22:02.95]Yes, I got it at the dump.
[22:04.49]Why would you wear somebody else's suit that you got at the dump?
[22:06.64]You can wash it.
[22:08.28]How'd you find one?
[22:09.60]Your side.
[22:10.94]Somebody was there.
[22:12.06]I picked it up.
[22:12.80]It fit.
[22:13.40]Probably somebody his size died.
[22:15.40]I mean, why would I wear it?
[22:17.76]It's a perfectly good suit.
[22:19.45]Maybe they died in that suit.
[22:20.83]I was just going to say, I hope not.
[22:23.61]Well, that's a pleasant thought.
[22:24.95]I mean, it looks good on you, but I hope you get to wear it another day.
[22:27.77]Maybe they're wearing it right now, Michael.
[22:30.65]No, Michael's wearing it right now, Lou.
[22:32.90]Can I have a piece of his hand?
[22:36.00]Is he, Jane?
[22:36.40]Oh, go ahead.
[22:37.16]Is he?
[22:37.70]Yeah, I think he is.
[22:38.84]Oh, maybe borrow some of your clothes.
[22:40.06]Why?
[22:40.76]Why are we here?
[22:41.56]Why?
[22:41.78]Why?
[22:42.11]No, it's not that I want them.
[22:43.79]I'm just hungry.
[22:44.23]Because it's Easter and we're a family.
[22:46.75]That's why.
[22:48.08]I don't want to eat like an animal off the table with my hands.
[22:50.64]Dude, you eat over the sink every night of the week.
[22:52.56]Who are you kidding?
[22:53.30]Right off the paper.
[22:54.38]Could move back to the can.
[22:56.72]If you've got enough plates, you know how many family members you have.
[22:59.76]If you've got enough plates, then we wouldn't have this problem.
[23:02.96]This is really thickly cut.
[23:04.25]This is perfect.
[23:05.51]Gene, baby.
[23:07.23]Could I get that glass down there?
[23:09.15]I have a slab of that.
[23:11.01]Let me see it for you.
[23:11.87]Sorry, Mike.
[23:12.43]Oh, that's good ham.
[23:13.09]I might have stolen your cup there.
[23:14.17]Good ham.
[23:15.05]Very good ham.
[23:16.47]There you go.
[23:17.43]Let me down some of those spuds, will you?
[23:19.35]There you go.
[23:20.31]You want some of these babies?
[23:21.56]Absolutely.
[23:22.00]How's Teddy doing?
[23:23.24]Your dog?
[23:23.72]They haven't been left in the car.
[23:25.24]He's getting old.
[23:25.72]He's starting to get the arthritis and everything that goes with a big dog.
[23:29.48]But he still protects the living quarters, so that's good.
[23:34.09]Oh, yes, he does.
[23:34.83]He barks his head off at me every time I come.
[23:37.23]I wish Otto was here.
[23:38.13]Then he jumps up on me and knocks me over.
[23:39.59]Well, he's just trying to be nice to you.
[23:41.47]See what he does to other people.
[23:42.73]I got you.
[23:43.67]Do you know Otto?
[23:44.53]Have you met Otto before?
[23:46.78]Out of my dog?
[23:48.00]No.
[23:48.66]Yeah, that's right.
[23:49.16]You wouldn't have done it.
[23:50.10]That's an oversized rat.
[23:51.70]Whoa.
[23:53.12]And by the way, excuse me, I take offense to that.
[23:55.79]Oversized rat.
[23:56.59]You stick it out the window and squeeze it?
[23:58.41]You know what?
[23:59.11]You think the rats take offense to it?
[24:00.43]Yeah.
[24:01.84]I gotta pump maybe five minutes in me before I blow my strap, okay?
[24:07.10]First you come in and you went up me on the whole food thing.
[24:10.60]Then you went up me and talked about my dog being a fucking rat.
[24:13.62]And now you got everybody here, mom, dad, grandpa, forget about him, whatever.
[24:19.33]It's not right, boys.
[24:20.99]It's not right.
[24:21.77]It's not right, boys.
[24:23.05]We're here.
[24:24.05]We're having dinner.
[24:25.41]Everything's fine.
[24:26.45]Just chill out.
[24:27.25]I've been stressed out a lot.
[24:28.55]You understand?
[24:29.55]You know, they understand.
[24:30.97]You guys understand me.
[24:32.15]I've been stressed out a lot.
[24:33.09]I've been through a lot of shit with work.
[24:35.65]And I've had all kinds of problems.
[24:37.99]So if I could just get one minute without being attacked by the family.
[24:43.05]Don't just take it out on us.
[24:45.48]We are here for you.
[24:47.22]And I think you're using the term work loosely.
[24:49.20]You don't think you're going to have to put her in a home, do you?
[24:51.88]Come on, boy.
[24:53.64]Stop ribbing your brother.
[24:54.73]He's probably going to live with Jeremy.
[24:56.39]You can eat my asshole.
[25:01.83]With a fork.
[25:02.73]Jeremy, don't say that.
[25:06.03]It's bullshit.
[25:08.26]You fucked up.
[25:09.50]You don't have food for us.
[25:10.82]You fucked up.
[25:11.72]You fucked up.
[25:12.58]No, I fucked up.
[25:13.52]Yeah, you're right.
[25:14.08]I did.
[25:14.34]I fucked up when you were like eight years old.
[25:15.92]I probably fucked you up somehow.
[25:17.48]But today I'm talking about you screw up.
[25:20.64]You don't have any food.
[25:21.66]These guys bail your ass out and now you're all pissy about it?
[25:24.55]Yeah.
[25:25.64]It's my house.
[25:26.20]Does that make sense?
[25:27.76]Hey!
[25:27.96]Michael, calm down.
[25:28.66]What?
[25:28.88]Just calm down.
[25:30.38]There's alcohol in this.
[25:33.66]It wasn't all this fucking juicy juice.
[25:35.20]They had it right the whole time.
[25:36.58]I haven't had a drink in 10 years.
[25:38.98]Let's go.
[25:39.60]Oh, Lou.
[25:41.68]You would do, Lou.
[25:42.68]Lou, are you okay?
[25:45.18]That's it.
[25:46.06]Let me take that.
[25:47.20]How about y'all get the fuck out of my house?
[25:50.15]How does that sound?
[25:51.31]How about you get the fuck out of my house?
[25:52.55]Jeremy!
[25:53.57]How does that sound?
[25:54.11]You're going to kick your own mother out.
[25:55.53]You know how expensive that fire was?
[25:56.99]That was $215.
[25:57.29]Jeremy, you just had a good one.
[26:01.62]Have this one on me.
[26:02.32]Sit down.
[26:02.56]Mom, I don't want to sit down.
[26:05.82]Listen to your mother.
[26:08.02]No, I'm not going to sit down, Mom.
[26:09.55]I'm not going to do it.
[26:11.31]I'm not going to sit down, Mom.
[26:13.11]Jeremy, you're acting like a child now.
[26:14.91]Will you just please behave yourself?
[26:18.67]I've got to take a video of this.
[26:19.51]This is great.
[26:20.17]You're going to get a video of this?
[26:22.15]It's already a video going up right now.
[26:23.85]I'm taking another video.
[26:26.05]You can put the phone down.
[26:28.42]Danny's people might see.
[26:30.38]We are here in real life.
[26:31.82]You can put the phone down.
[26:34.18]Well, Jay and Michael, you're really showing off your parenting skills tonight.
[26:38.52]Really proud.
[26:39.22]Yeah, we're really proud.
[26:46.78]Yeah, well.
[26:47.64]I noticed Gus managed to get over his problem with artistry.
[26:52.36]I noticed him supporting him.
[26:54.98]I don't notice him sending him any money.
[26:56.42]I mean, it's fine.
[26:57.92]I just wish we could get through a holiday with him.
[27:00.82]Yeah, let's go get along.
[27:02.02]We're having a good time.
[27:03.52]We've got ham.
[27:04.34]I haven't even tried the meatballs yet.
[27:07.35]You're welcome, by the way.
[27:08.93]I know better.
[27:10.77]So what are you guys doing later?
[27:14.54]Um, probably headed into Boston.
[27:16.40]Right?
[27:16.80]Shouldn't we?
[27:17.26]Yeah, definitely.
[27:18.54]Yo, there's this new place I heard about.
[27:21.26]Yeah?
[27:21.54]Yeah.
[27:22.17]Girls.
[27:23.07]Wait, a new place?
[27:24.79]Yeah.
[27:25.47]Yeah, girls.
[27:26.03]Nice, really?
[27:26.73]Oh, absolutely.
[27:27.81]I got some hookups in Boston soon.
[27:29.15]Unreal.
[27:29.39]Right, like... What?
[27:31.66]A new place in Beantown that we're talking about, right?
[27:34.74]Are you going to take Jeremy with you?
[27:36.86]Come on.
[27:37.90]Come on.
[27:38.48]He's got clean up to do.
[27:40.72]I don't like any of you going to something like that.
[27:44.87]Come on.
[27:45.53]Mom, this is a well-established place.
[27:47.51]Oh, yeah.
[27:48.05]Classy is an understatement.
[27:50.13]So that's why we were thinking maybe.
[27:51.87]You're dressed to go out, so look at you.
[27:55.09]I put this on.
[27:56.25]I don't wear this shit typically.
[27:57.69]Come on.
[27:58.11]That is a nice sweater.
[28:00.16]Thank you.
[28:00.58]I didn't put it on so we could eat soup out of a can.
[28:05.74]He has a point.
[28:06.56]He has a point.
[28:07.86]And yet we're eating soup out of a can.
[28:09.88]And yet we are.
[28:10.50]Define we because I want to touch that.
[28:12.08]As a family.
[28:12.50]If you don't want to eat soup out of a can, dude.
[28:14.72]It's technically drinking.
[28:15.88]You don't have to eat soup out of a can.
[28:17.96]I really don't plan on it because I'm a grown man.
[28:19.76]And the one good thing about this.
[28:20.94]Table of silence, commence.
[28:22.56]Never forget.
[28:23.71]Where do you get this?
[28:25.56]I don't know, from you.
[28:26.30]Remember when we were kids?
[28:27.90]Did it ever work?
[28:29.30]When I would tell you guys to be quiet, did it ever work?
[28:31.92]Yes, it did.
[28:32.59]No.
[28:33.01]No, it never worked.
[28:34.49]If you didn't drop him on his head, he wouldn't.
[28:42.53]Oh, come on.
[28:44.25]Go to your fun little establishment and bust it out.
[28:46.37]Michael, we know it did work.
[28:47.47]Get out of my house.
[28:48.07]I'm drinking a lot.
[28:49.37]I'm getting real angry at your family.
[28:51.05]Get out.
[28:51.75]Get out.
[28:52.23]Get out of the house now.
[28:53.15]I'm saying get out of the house.
[28:54.53]My two blood brothers, get out of the house.
[28:56.43]My blood-related brothers, get out of the house now.
[28:58.79]I would be perfectly fine watching TV at home.
[29:00.87]That's how you do it over there.
[29:02.17]One dinner without a hissy fit.
[29:03.35]You're out.
[29:03.79]Both of you, you're out.
[29:05.35]You can stay.
[29:06.85]You four can stay.
[29:08.19]Is that what you want?
[29:08.83]Go have your fun with your girls in Boston.
[29:10.94]That's so fucking cool.
[29:11.70]They came a long way to be here.
[29:13.36]Didn't we?
[29:14.12]Together.
[29:14.62]They didn't come with me.
[29:16.18]Well, I flew in from New York.
[29:17.62]He flew in from San Francisco.
[29:19.28]So go back to fucking San Francisco.
[29:20.86]I didn't come from San Francisco.
[29:21.68]And do your little dee-dee-dee-dee on the computer fucking job.
[29:24.51]I'm on the computer.
[29:25.85]My name is Dylan.
[29:26.91]I go on the computer.
[29:28.19]So are you.
[29:29.09]You popped that sweater.
[29:31.17]Well, there's a difference.
[29:32.17]I make money.
[29:33.75]You wish these were actors?
[29:36.94]Well, you do you.
[29:39.18]That's fucking fine.
[29:41.68]Real family.
[29:43.54]Me too.
[29:44.00]I wish I was an actor so I could leave afterwards.
[29:46.17]Well, you do.
[29:46.67]You are going to leave afterwards because that's what happens when you go to somebody's house and you leave.
[29:49.81]Wouldn't it be great if this was like a play and this wasn't a real...
[29:53.51]It'd be pretty fun.
[29:54.45]Offspring.
[29:56.43]Nobody would write this.
[29:57.59]I am perfectly proud of all my balloons.
[30:01.69]Thank you, Mom.
[30:02.53]I appreciate that, Mom.
[30:03.23]I do.
[30:04.05]All two of them.
[30:05.18]Well, I'll tell you what.
[30:06.60]I got a lot of material to talk to my therapist about after this.
[30:09.42]You see a therapist?
[30:10.24]You're a funny guy.
[30:11.86]No, you should go on YouTube and do a funny guy show.
[30:14.28]www.youtube.com slash funny guy online.
[30:17.96]Not too hard, I don't think.
[30:19.11]Funny guy with a nice sweater.
[30:21.13]What title?
[30:23.48]Your brother's seeing a therapist.
[30:25.34]For what?
[30:26.52]This whole family that's just getting messed up with me.
[30:30.73]You don't even see us.
[30:31.69]There's nothing wrong with this family.
[30:33.29]How the hell do we mess you up?
[30:34.17]You're not even around.
[30:35.37]I respect that.
[30:36.47]I respect that.
[30:37.39]Do you see a therapist?
[30:39.05]Do I personally?
[30:39.73]You live in San Francisco.
[30:40.83]You get one when you move into the city.
[30:42.31]They're wearing a dump suit.
[30:44.05]It came with the apartment, Dad.
[30:45.37]It does?
[30:46.39]For those prices?
[30:47.63]What, six grand?
[30:48.99]Six, seven grand?
[30:49.95]Is my fly down?
[30:52.86]delete this part don't look at that part this is a perfectly normal thing you're right you're right all families are made up of human beings that have their their own stuff and their own faults and we all deal with each other the best that we can the important thing is
[31:16.33]We all love each other and we all look out for each other.
[31:20.09]Yeah, that's true Did you hear anything since you just said it all I heard everything she said she's proud of you guys blah blah blah blah So did you not listen to her saying the words she was saying?
[31:30.57]Well, I did.
[31:31.18]Sorry.
[31:31.70]You didn't hear that.
[31:32.62]I was I was just thinking this therapy might help you out.
[31:37.32]It sounded nice.
[31:38.50]It sounded good.
[31:39.60]Mom, it sounded great and you're insane.
[31:41.50]Oh sweetie, stop.
[31:43.14]There you go.
[31:43.64]We're all just stuck, you know.
[31:45.54]I don't know.
[31:45.86]I'm going to delete that part, too.
[31:48.00]Get rid of that part.
[31:49.28]Delete it all.
[31:50.64]Who are you talking to?
[31:52.04]I'm talking to somebody.
[31:53.38]Hey, just delete that part when you get a chance.
[31:55.16]I'm fine.
[31:56.04]I don't need anything like that.
[31:57.52]These are not bad.
[31:58.16]Have you tried some of these?
[31:59.10]You've got to eat something.
[32:01.38]I've had a little bit of the ham and a little bit of the Hunts Tomato sponsored stream.
[32:04.68]You know what I mean?
[32:07.74]I did have a little bit of the Hunts Tomato sponsored stream.
[32:13.21]Honestly, I'm just...
[32:14.63]I'm shocked that you've eaten that.
[32:17.17]What, something wrong with the potatoes?
[32:18.87]The potatoes are fine, no.
[32:20.72]I mean, honestly, you've made me lose my appetite.
[32:24.73]Luke, come on.
[32:25.69]Help me out here.
[32:28.67]I try not to worry myself with his OCD.
[32:34.57]No food touching other food.
[32:36.65]Eat everything in order.
[32:37.69]I like that.
[32:38.31]That's a good suit.
[32:39.38]You didn't get that at the dump, did you?
[32:40.90]I did not get the suit at a dump, no.
[32:43.36]Well, we're stuck with these.
[32:46.48]At a common retail store where they fit it for you
[32:51.18]There's choices.
[32:52.32]Fitted suit?
[32:52.92]It's wonderful.
[32:54.34]Taylor, good man.
[32:55.20]Just wonderful.
[32:56.22]You paid retail?
[32:56.70]Smartest guy I know right now.
[32:57.69]Smartest guy I know.
[32:59.25]You paid retail?
[33:00.43]He doesn't.
[33:01.19]I paid retail, Michael.
[33:04.03]Does that surprise you?
[33:05.79]No, not at all.
[33:06.29]It doesn't surprise me at all.
[33:07.45]Listen, we waste three boys on a budget.
[33:10.67]What's wrong with paying retail?
[33:13.69]Retail's for suckers.
[33:15.74]You get your best stuff at the dump.
[33:17.46]Yeah.
[33:19.00]You come by the dump.
[33:20.02]I'll get your furniture for this whole place.
[33:22.25]It's interesting because I leave my worst stuff at the dump.
[33:25.71]Yeah, exactly.
[33:26.47]I leave all my worst shit at the dump.
[33:28.77]Not everybody does.
[33:29.77]You'd be surprised at what these people do.
[33:31.35]Well, you know, one man's treasure is another man's treasury.
[33:34.81]Yeah.
[33:37.15]Well, it's true.
[33:38.05]I just wish there wasn't quite so much of it.
[33:42.27]What do you mean?
[33:43.83]You have to let go sometimes.
[33:45.77]We can barely walk down the hallway.
[33:47.63]We can walk down the hallway fine.
[33:49.64]That stuff's pricey.
[33:50.92]That's our whole retirement sitting right there.
[33:54.64]Our whole retirement sitting right there in the house.
[33:56.60]Well, this has been lots of fun.
[33:58.60]Thanks, guys, for coming to the dinner.
[34:01.20]This has been fun.
[34:02.03]Did we have an Easter song?
[34:03.53]We didn't even say grace.
[34:08.62]Oh, now you're religious?
[34:09.62]You're the host.
[34:10.78]Everybody, what?
[34:12.50]Let me do it, because you, Dad, you usually do it.
[34:14.62]You do a really good job, Dad.
[34:15.84]Does it count after you've already ate?
[34:17.90]I think so.
[34:18.44]No, it doesn't.
[34:19.56]It doesn't.
[34:20.32]Kudos.
[34:21.58]I think the Lord listens to us.
[34:23.14]It goes to a different department or something.
[34:26.09]Forgive us for those that we gift that.
[34:27.73]Hold on.
[34:28.13]Let me do it.
[34:28.97]Let him do grace.
[34:29.59]He's doing grace.
[34:31.19]I'm not holding anyone's hand.
[34:33.31]Just put your hands on the kitchen.
[34:35.11]Everyone put your hands on the kitchen.
[34:36.09]Just prostrate yourself.
[34:37.99]Okay.
[34:39.37]What?
[34:41.15]Bless us our these gourds.
[34:45.31]Bless us our Lord for these gifts.
[34:50.46]That's not necessary.
[34:51.94]Fart sounds are fucking funny in 2018.
[34:53.52]Come on.
[34:54.10]This is a prayer.
[34:56.98]Be nice.
[34:58.13]Bless us our Lord for these our gifts which we are going to receive by the bounty for
[35:09.11]Christ our Lord.
[35:11.20]Who wrote that one, the Pope?
[35:12.20]And I just want to say, it's been a... That was pretty funny.
[35:17.46]I want to say, first of all, thanks for coming out everybody.
[35:21.84]You guys really, without no joking around, no messing around, no talking shit.
[35:26.17]Thank you for coming out.
[35:28.11]Some of you guys came a long way.
[35:29.41]It's nice to see your house for the first time.
[35:31.59]I thought it was going to be like 70 cats in here.
[35:34.91]Well, I got this one.
[35:37.57]I don't know where she is right now.
[35:40.13]I honestly thought it'd be smaller.
[35:45.08]Could have been.
[35:46.32]Is that what she said?
[35:49.02]She's talking to Jeremy, right?
[35:50.46]That wasn't funny either.
[35:52.80]He has a very nice place.
[35:54.20]He even cleaned it up for once for us.
[35:56.34]Oh, is that your mom?
[35:57.84]I'm giving you credit.
[35:58.56]I honestly thought it would be smaller.
[36:04.40]I'm surprised it's not a trail.
[36:05.72]Jeremy, come on.
[36:07.52]No, I'm going to just take a quick little bathroom break for like 45 minutes.
[36:13.59]It's called escaping.
[36:14.45]Yeah, you can escape room.
[36:16.75]You guys can do your thing.
[36:18.37]The meatballs are great, by the way.
[36:19.61]I really appreciate it.
[36:20.93]Oh, my God.
[36:22.71]Now that he's gone, you got any stories to... He's such a tool!
[36:26.31]I mean, you guys are basically alright.
[36:28.63]What the fuck did I do wrong with this kid?
[36:30.69]I don't know.
[36:31.77]He's the last one.
[36:32.49]You gave up.
[36:33.22]He's a tool!
[36:34.20]You gave up by that point.
[36:35.30]Now, now, he's not that bad.
[36:36.72]I mean, he's terrible, but he's not that bad.
[36:38.74]He's our son.
[36:40.06]He's your brother.
[36:43.38]Hold on.
[36:44.27]Dad, what did I do wrong?
[36:45.71]He's your grandson.
[36:46.54]I mean, he's a... I don't think you did anything wrong.
[36:49.12]Here he comes, here he comes.
[36:50.44]I just do a different drummer and he carries a different flag.
[36:53.48]How did you two end up with Massachusetts accents worse than speech impediments?
[36:59.35]I was wondering if there was dessert.
[37:01.11]I got dessert.
[37:01.53]I got some classic cotton candy.
[37:02.42]I live in New York and travel back and forth.
[37:04.64]Give me some of that blue stuff.
[37:06.88]It'll go with my diabetes.
[37:07.82]It's like a clown threw up.
[37:09.42]What is that?
[37:10.15]It's cotton candy.
[37:10.81]I got cotton candy.
[37:11.29]It's dessert.
[37:11.71]You don't know what this is?
[37:12.95]This is melt-in-your-mouth sugar.
[37:14.67]Just watch.
[37:15.11]Ready?
[37:17.04]I mean, you could probably fit that whole bucket in your mouth at once.
[37:20.08]It disappears faster than your hopes and dreams do.
[37:22.91]Gus, what a dirty mind you've got.
[37:24.91]Once we're out, you're all leaving.
[37:26.81]And it turns your tongue blue, too.
[37:28.63]It does, right?
[37:29.55]That's right, Grandpa Gus.
[37:31.79]Everybody loves Grandpa Gus.
[37:35.23]Looks like you've been licking a Smurf's hand.
[37:41.13]Why would you lick the hand?
[37:42.23]I mean, if you're going to lick a Smurf, I wouldn't say it.
[37:44.49]Why do you lick a Smurf, Michael?
[37:46.75]Tell me how.
[37:47.49]I'm just saying, if you're going to go to the point where you're going to lick this Smurf, you might as well get a black one.
[37:52.04]I'm going to tell you right now, some of those girl Smurfs look pretty hot.
[37:55.00]They're pretty hot.
[37:55.94]There's only one.
[37:56.82]There's only one of them.
[37:58.84]There's only one that they've shown you.
[38:00.92]They taste like cotton candy.
[38:02.72]I'm all over it.
[38:04.44]Gus, I got bad news for you.
[38:06.18]There's only one sex.
[38:08.21]I'm turning this off.
[38:08.89]I'm going to fuck out of here.
[38:10.71]That's my fucked up family.
[38:15.49]Everyone looks a little different.
[38:17.55]Alright, so.
[38:20.11]I want to say hi to the friends over here.
[38:24.06]Hi, friends over there.
