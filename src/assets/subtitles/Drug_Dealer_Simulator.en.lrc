[00:01.57]Good afternoon.
[00:06.16]How are you?
[00:06.94]Good.
[00:07.36]Welcome.
[00:10.08]Welcome to the third stream.
[00:16.06]One, two, three.
[00:17.50]This is number three.
[00:21.44]For the weekend.
[00:23.03]Ending on April 19th, 2021.
[00:29.51]If this is correct, press 1.
[00:32.25]If this is incorrect, press 2.
[00:33.85]To erase and re-record, press 3.
[00:47.27]At the beep, please re-record your message.
[00:50.29]When you're finished recording, you may hang up or press pound for more options.
[00:56.24]What's going on, guys?
[00:56.82]Welcome to the stream.
[00:57.80]Uh, it's me, Jerma.
[00:59.20]Uh, just getting you, hitting you up.
[01:01.01]Let's see if you're ready to go.
[01:01.85]If you're ready to go, then give me a call back whenever you get the chance.
[01:06.82]Although I'm live right now, so you ain't gonna get the chance, because this is it.
[01:11.17]Today we're going to play, uh, well we had a little bit of a pre-stream issue.
[01:17.54]And what I mean by that is today we're going to potentially play Toontown Reloaded.
[01:23.08]But, uh, turns out it was, not that it was hard to set up, but...
[01:30.21]I wanted to see if it was possible to do a different server or set it up in a way where I could actually play Toontown.
[01:36.86]And it turns out, no, I can't.
[01:38.80]So, we're gonna do, instead of Toontown today, I'm not gonna eat a ghost pepper.
[01:44.20]What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:46.98]Eat a ghost pepper.
[01:48.18]Not that I couldn't be bothered to.
[01:50.55]Listen, alright, you're distracting me.
[01:53.53]So, I'm gonna do MMO Grab Bag 2.
[01:59.31]Because I've seen a lot of people write stuff like, dude, you should play City of Heroes!
[02:02.36]Dude, you're champions online!
[02:03.72]Let's all dump into Roblox!
[02:05.50]Let's all play RuneScape!
[02:06.60]And I'm just like, eh, eh, eh, eh.
[02:09.88]Toontown!
[02:11.60]So, we're gonna do a MMO Grab Bag 2.
[02:16.73]Did one before.
[02:18.69]Toontown will be part of that.
[02:22.27]It's just not gonna be today.
[02:29.86]Because every one of these is all going to go the same way.
[02:35.34]I'm going to get in the game and there's going to be like 500 people.
[02:40.41]All of you are going to try to push me into the ocean.
[02:44.75]And, you know, after about 20, 30 minutes of that, how many times can we get me pushed into the ocean?
[02:51.47]Or too many names on the screen so I can't attack or tag the enemy or touch the quest giver.
[02:58.44]You know, how many times can we do that in, like, Toontown?
[03:02.15]Before... It's always funny, though.
[03:04.73]Yeah, I know it, but we have to... When will I do this?
[03:12.43]When am I gonna play Toontown?
[03:13.49]Alright, so here's the deal.
[03:14.78]Okay?
[03:17.52]The guy that plans nothing is about to give you a plan, okay?
[03:21.54]Okay?
[03:23.25]Wednesday is public domain movie night.
[03:26.53]Thursday is community content night.
[03:28.79]Friday is mystery game night.
[03:31.33]Saturday is the EasyBake oven stream.
[03:36.86]After that, somewhere probably around Tuesday or Wednesday, Wednesday the 29th, we will try to do MMO Grab Bag 2.
[03:51.84]I'm still waiting for Doom.
[03:53.50]Me too.
[03:54.15]It keeps getting... I'm never going to play it.
[03:56.91]It's not going to happen.
[03:57.69]I'm just going to be completely real with myself.
[03:59.57]I don't think I'm ever going to play Doom Eternal.
[04:06.54]Anyways, today we're going to do drugs.
[04:09.35]drugs uh because after it turned out the toontown was not going to really work out uh we were like hey but what about like the what about like a stocks simulator that'd be fun so we looked up a bunch of stocks games and some of them for dos some of them for like regular Nintendo and they were kind of all ass and I was like wait a minute isn't this drug game is stocks right it's just stocks but drugs like okay drug dealing stock simulator
[04:39.63]But I did find a good stocks game.
[04:41.71]We're going to play it.
[04:42.43]It's not today.
[04:47.58]And here we go.
[04:51.30]I'm going to get $50.

[05:42.24]No, I don't wanna, you can break a fucking microphone that way.
[05:46.08]I know a lot of you guys think it's, like, funny when people, like, scream into their microphones.
[05:50.26]I do, too.
[05:51.06]Everybody does.
[05:52.32]But, if you have a microphone, if you have, like, a nice microphone, you can damage the insides.
[05:57.87]It's got, it's like a light bulb in there.
[05:59.67]It can break.
[06:07.75]Loud is funny child humor It's not even that funny.
[06:12.81]Okay, but it is it's not but that means screaming is kind of funny You can't tell me that like a scream isn't funny in some places Screaming at a light bulb will break it that don't dumb saying that just be careful with your shit Okay, this is drug dealer simulator.
[06:32.33]We're gonna play the stock market except it's drugs and

[37:57.22]Give me 30 minutes.
[38:01.72]Order delivery may take some time.
[38:02.90]It depends mostly on how large the package is.
[38:04.69]Remember to always plan this ahead.
[38:09.10]Eddie will inform you when the package is ready to retrieve.
[38:11.02]In the meantime, you can either find some other tasks to do or wait.
[38:13.46]Hit T while in hideout to open the wait dialog.
[38:18.29]I go to... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[38:20.23]I'm going to go to the... Wait, I'm going to bring like $5 with me.
[38:25.69]How much money is my backpack?
[38:29.87]Wait, how do I pay for the drugs?
[38:32.22]There's skill points?
[38:35.36]What?
[38:35.54]What?
[38:41.79]The general risk factor.
[38:44.69]Raises with every risky trade, chase, and high-risk action.
[38:49.53]This increases the chance of being robbed, attacked, or ambushed by the DEA.
[38:52.51]You want to keep this low.
[38:56.87]Every time criminal activity includes sales, police chases, and arrests, this affects the general visibility of your actions.
[39:01.75]Higher exposition means you have more police patrols around the streets.
[39:05.07]And you'll draw DEA.
[39:05.75]You want to keep this low.
[39:10.87]Alright, what about skills?
[39:13.59]Illusionist?
[39:14.55]I don't care what it is.
[39:19.37]I want to be an illusionist.
[39:21.53]Okay, I'm going to be an illusionist.
[39:22.90]How much more?
[39:23.32]Do it again.
[39:23.64]Okay, that's a slight percent chance that police won't find drugs in your inventory when searched.
[39:31.64]Good.
[39:34.00]Alright, I have... How many points do I have?
[39:35.87]That's it.
[39:40.73]I should have done pockets.
[39:44.43]Probably should have increased pocket size rather than be like a street magician.
[39:49.40]Okay.
[39:49.66]Hold on.
[39:49.92]Let me just let Otto out of the room.
[39:59.16]He sensed, he sensed Kim.
[40:04.35]Alright, so here we go.
[40:06.45]Organizer.

[40:44.12]I have a $10 bill.
[40:45.08]Alright, now get rid of this.
[40:48.30]You have three clients so far.
[40:49.49]That's cute, but it won't get you far.
[40:52.19]To grow your business, you need to unlock more areas and keep your respect high.
[40:55.49]Get at the computer to learn more about gaining new sales.
[40:59.81]Deliveries left in dead drops for a long time may be stolen.
[41:02.37]Oh, fuck.
[41:02.74]Wait, I have to buy it?
[41:03.56]I have to bring the backpack?
[41:07.21]Oh shit, okay, I gotta go.
[41:08.95]Do I have to buy them here at the drop?
[41:17.29]Oh shit, how much money do I have?

[42:11.21]Alright, so now... Take this.
[42:15.91]Take this.
[42:20.15]I didn't even need to bring the money.
[42:21.15]Do I put the money over here?
[42:24.38]On the wall?
[42:32.56]Why have I had this cash on me?
[42:36.18]Why did you guys tell me to do this?
[42:39.18]Oh, it's Eddie!
[42:40.96]Yo, I heard the authorities got pissed by that tire fire situation, and they're sending more police on the streets.
[42:47.36]Watch out for patrols while you run around, they might be nosy.
[42:50.64]What?
[42:53.01]Oh no, I have fucking- Wait, good thing I'm a master illusionist!
[42:56.51]Excuse me, sir!
[43:01.77]And I'm gonna- I'm gonna fucking like put- crumple up like a piece of paper and like throw it behind his head, and then I'm gonna find the paper behind his ear?

[43:52.17]I want it to keep half on me.
[43:59.59]No, I'm holding control.

[93:04.35]Let me get this straight.
[93:05.23]A bunch of you guys have never turned a whipped cream can upside down and like into your mouth.
[93:16.23]That's impossible.
[93:18.30]There's no fucking way any of you are telling the truth.
[93:23.26]What?
[93:25.40]Not ever in your whole life?
[93:28.00]Ever?
[93:30.56]No way.
[93:31.32]I don't believe any of you.

[93:42.84]It's disgusting.
[93:45.72]How dare you do something like that?
[93:47.82]No, I sit down at a table with a fork and knife and I get a plate and I take the can of whipped cream and I turn it up.
[93:55.75]My first I wiped the nozzle down and then I turn it upside down and I do under the plate and then I take the fork and knife and I cut into it and eat it like a fucking steak.

[94:44.20]Rubber cement is an adhesive.
[94:54.66]And no, I'm not talking about, like, breathing in the gas, okay?
[94:58.38]I'm talking about... No.
[94:59.82]Some of you guys... Oh, fuck.

[96:23.86]So you go.
[96:28.64]And it's gone.
[96:32.03]Don't do that on cam.

[99:47.62]Don't worry.
[99:49.86]What if I just brought the box of sugar?
[99:57.93]New package, two grams.
[100:00.47]Alright, let's go.
[100:03.14]And then I can pick up the delivery.
[100:07.62]Sounds good to me.
[100:11.98]Cut the weed with sugar.
[100:13.56]Oh, you're literally right there.
[100:24.38]Where are all these dogs?
[100:25.84]Every time I come over here, there's dogs, dogs, dogs.
[100:27.70]But I never see them.
[100:34.57]Alright, what's up?
[100:35.83]I have it.
[100:36.23]20 bucks, that's it.
[100:40.57]I was about to say, who the fuck did that?
[100:44.63]It was me.
[100:45.03]I was like, who's stealing my stuff?
[100:48.40]I have to go to the other place.
[100:49.48]I have to go to the other town.
[100:52.42]It's not even my house.
[100:56.12]Wait, I'm normal.
[100:58.10]I'm normal.
[100:58.60]I have spray paint and cash.
[101:01.44]I could be working.
[101:01.96]I'm doing a DIY project outside in front of my house.
[101:04.63]I'm spray painting a table.
[101:06.25]This table.
[101:14.28]Okay, we're good.
[101:18.96]This is a new customer, but I don't have any drugs.
[101:30.11]Alright, where's my, uh... Is this, like, whipped cream?
[101:39.88]I can't believe none of you guys do the whipped cream thing.
[101:43.80]There's so many things that are normal that I have done in my life that you guys think is just, like, I may as well be, like, screaming somewhere.
[101:53.52]Like, on the sidewalk.
[101:56.14]Like, with, like, naked or something.
[101:58.08]Like, what are you talking about?
[102:00.81]Alright, I got my... Where's the package?
[102:10.04]Alright, the package is right there in East Old Town.
[102:13.57]Those are my drugs.
[102:14.79]I need them.
[102:15.13]This guy breathes regularly.
[102:19.91]No, actually, I kind of don't.
[102:22.68]When I'm sleeping and lying down, I do like a...
[102:29.47]And then I kinda sometimes I do that.
[102:36.91]And I like... Hold on, I think I... Did I have another backpack?
[103:02.47]Geez, please tell me you're giving free drug samples.
[103:07.79]No, you're under arrest.
[103:10.30]Oh, geez.
[103:12.24]Alright, let's just go get the package.
[103:14.22]Wait, that person was running.
[103:16.54]Over to the package?
[103:18.00]These things get stolen, can't they?
[103:22.46]Get the fuck out of here.
[103:23.18]I need to level up illusion.
[103:29.22]Where is it?
[103:29.50]There it is.
[103:33.87]Search the tires.
[103:36.51]Thank you.
[103:37.53]Got it.
[103:38.67]Alright, let's go do these orders.
[103:45.46]That's not my house.
[103:47.66]I think it's my house every time.
[104:02.83]So can I eventually unlock any door I want?
[104:05.53]Is this like a lockpicking skill?
[104:07.07]Why don't I just do that?
[104:15.93]Illusionist.
[104:17.45]Pockets.
[104:18.31]Quick learner.
[104:20.61]Here's experience points.
[104:24.71]Here's the price you're able to demand for your product.
[104:27.35]Ooh.
[104:30.25]But illusionist.
[104:36.05]Decreases the probability you'll be spotted by the police.
[104:38.21]That's so important.
[104:39.01]Increases running speed.
[104:43.05]Stamina.
[104:45.15]Number of pockets making you able to carry more items without a backpack.
[104:48.58]I think I want salesman.
[104:51.98]Yeah.
[104:53.70]I want to be able to sell my stuff for more money.
[104:55.12]Okay.
[105:00.10]I got the rugs.
[105:01.22]Now who wants them?
[105:06.77]Package is waiting at the playgrounds.
[105:08.15]Okay, cool.
[105:10.27]I need two Gs.
[105:11.82]So we need two.
[105:16.36]Three.
[105:19.22]Two.
[105:22.54]Two, three, two.
[105:25.59]Two, three, two.
[105:26.37]Oh, here it is.
[105:39.26]And we're gonna change this up a little bit.
[105:41.03]Okay.
[105:41.35]2, 3, 2.
[105:42.67]So, uh, let's put these drugs over here.
[105:45.33]And we're gonna add, um, what?
[105:50.21]5 grams?
[105:51.65]So, 5 grams.
[105:53.83]And then I'm gonna put 5 grams of baking soda.
[106:04.09]Okay.
[106:04.27]Okay.
[106:08.99]And then we're gonna apply.
[106:09.93]Okay, so this is... Alright, I did it.
[106:34.25]The mix has been applied.
[106:38.92]Alright, so store it in here.
[106:42.25]9.96.
[106:46.61]Okay, cool.
[106:50.57]This is 90% baking soda?
[106:53.21]No, it's not.
[106:53.81]Okay, so now I'm going to sell this.
[106:57.74]So we need two 3-2s, and I'm going to package.
[107:02.98]One package of three.
[107:08.42]And then two packages of two.
[107:09.59]Okay.
[107:15.85]Let's try it.
[107:20.23]Jeremy, you're out here curing heartburn.
[107:31.42]Don't you guys know?
[107:33.40]You think I'm like such a bad guy, right?
[107:35.30]You know, every Hershey bar can have up to like six bug legs in each bar.
[107:40.02]You know that, right?
[107:42.02]The FDA allows up to like three insect legs per Hershey bar.
[107:47.71]This is true.
[107:49.01]This is not me making this up.
[107:50.93]This is a real actual fact.
[107:53.49]So I can put two or three bug legs in my cocaine.
[108:01.92]Or 50% baking soda.
[108:08.04]That's an urban legend.
[108:10.35]That's a Facebook headline.
[108:13.15]It's not a Facebook headline.
[108:14.97]It's been proven by... You know, I don't know.
[108:19.45]I don't know.
[108:19.81]I've never looked into it.
[108:21.75]It's just that's what I've been told.
[108:23.85]I've never done the research to determine if that was real.
[108:27.44]That's just what was something that was told to me.
[108:30.24]Over, like, the decade or so that I've been alive.
[108:32.56]Whatever, you know, 20 of them.
[108:34.12]Whatever, however long it's been.
[108:36.11]It's just, hey, there's, uh, there's, like, 10 bug legs in every Hershey bar.
[108:39.03]And it's like, oh, yeah, everyone just says that.
[108:41.57]I never fucking looked up, like, are there insect legs in a Hershey bar?
[108:44.73]I don't fucking care.
[108:46.45]I don't care.
[108:46.97]If I'll leave them, maybe, I don't give a shit if there's bug legs in them or zero bug legs.
[108:50.33]Who cares?
[108:50.87]Bug legs are fine.
[108:51.72]It's not gonna hurt you.
[108:52.32]Alright, goodbye.
[109:03.77]Oh, people have orders waiting.
[109:04.91]Alright, so we got two grams.
[109:08.61]You got it.
[109:10.45]Two grams.
[109:10.99]You got it.
[109:11.85]Three grams.
[109:12.52]You got it.
[109:15.16]Okay.
[109:15.82]Two, three, two.
[109:16.62]Let's go.
[109:17.34]Save the game.
[109:26.02]Why not ten?
[109:27.05]What?
[109:27.15]Okay, there's Donald.
[109:36.41]Here you go, Donald.
[109:40.44]You probably want two.
[109:41.18]I'm not sure I would take something with the label that says filler test.
[109:54.01]It worked.
[110:14.38]Where is he?
[110:16.00]Come here, Raphael.
[110:18.34]Do you want three?
[110:21.40]No, you wanted two.
[110:22.35]24 bucks.
[110:25.13]Thank you.
[110:27.65]You can keep some of your money on a bank account.
[110:30.03]There are a few ATMs in the ghetto where you can withdraw or deposit cash.
[110:32.83]You will need bank account money for furniture shopping.
[110:34.90]Oh, I can put money in a bank.
[110:36.64]Alright, that's good.
[110:38.20]Really good to know.
[110:52.99]I do.
[110:53.49]Here it is.
[110:53.83]30 grams.
[110:54.97]That's a lot.
[110:58.13]Check out one of the ATMs.
[110:59.29]Okay, where's an ATM?
[111:01.47]ATM.
[111:06.18]You are allowed up to 60 insect parts and 100 grams of chocolate.
[111:09.58]This is real.
[111:10.20]Good.
[111:10.80]So I was right.
[111:11.72]Let's put $100 in the ATM.
[111:22.81]Alright, so if they stay alive, then theoretically shouldn't I just do like 98% baking soda?
[111:30.36]At some point.
[111:32.08]I guess you're going to get caught doing that.
[111:37.06]Where's this ATM?
[111:47.19]Oh, I can't.
[111:47.61]I'm not allowed over there.
[112:01.14]98% bug amphetamines.
[112:06.14]Okay, here we go.
[112:14.22]ATM.
[112:14.74]There it is.
[112:16.58]Alright, activate the ATM.
[112:17.68]Okay, now listen up.
[112:20.16]Carefully.
[112:21.66]The bank account is the place to keep your legal money.
[112:24.83]Uh-huh.
[112:25.51]You can use ATMs to withdraw or deposit cash, but be careful, huh?
[112:30.77]And keep in mind that you're an immigrant ghetto lowlife.
[112:34.35]Too much unregistered money flowing through that account is in the lower interest of the state.
[112:38.86]And that, my friend, is asking for trouble.
[112:49.65]Alright, let's put in $10 and watch while the bank gives us fees every month for $30 and our bank account becomes negative, like, $250 over the course of the next three months.
[113:02.91]Bastards.
[113:12.93]Oh, yeah.
[113:16.88]At an ATM, you can withdraw a deposit of cash.
[113:18.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[113:19.15]Keep in mind that too much unregistered cash flow draws authorities' attention.
[113:21.77]If you need to check your account balance, you can do so on the Shadycom computer.
[113:25.13]Debt?
[113:27.17]Okay.
[113:27.59]Well, I got my money.
[113:28.09]Safe.
[113:28.19]Who are you?
[113:44.60]Can I come in?
[113:45.14]Furniture shop.
[113:50.05]Oh, that has money in it.
[113:54.47]Alright, cool.
[113:55.13]What are my tasks?
[113:56.45]Unlock East Old Town in the Old Marketplace.
[113:59.23]Nobody fucking calls me.
[114:00.25]Nobody cares.
[114:00.79]Alright.
[114:02.75]Back to the house.
[114:04.03]I think that's a shadow of somebody running behind me.
[114:16.47]Wrong house.
[114:17.17]No.
[114:17.61]It's not the wrong house.
[114:18.65]Not yet.
[114:24.54]Almost.
[114:24.92]Wrong house.
[114:27.89]He thought I was going to do it.
[114:51.25]Okay.
[114:52.29]Save game.
[114:56.58]Now.
[114:58.08]Let's keep going with this drug stuff.
[115:02.62]Take a look at the computer.
[115:05.53]Chop.

[115:53.43]I got $950 here.
[115:53.91]Bitcoin wallet.
[115:54.33]Yeah.

[116:21.16]Would have been great to buy at those levels.
[116:25.04]God, if only I could have a time machine, I would buy 10,000 million of those things.
[116:33.20]Okay, so.
[116:34.64]I have speed.
[116:35.70]It's bad, but I still have it.
[116:38.26]Emma.
[116:41.48]What is this filler test shit?
[116:43.10]This is not what I expected.
[116:44.16]Bring me something better next time.
[116:49.53]What is this filler test shit?
[116:51.39]Bring me something better.
[116:52.17]This is filler shit.

[118:51.98]Two, two.

[120:20.75]You want marijuana?
[120:21.55]I got it for you.
[120:25.20]Level four.
[120:34.67]Who buys two grams of weed?
[120:36.29]I don't know.
[120:38.09]That guy.
[120:50.02]Here.
[120:50.22]Alright.
[120:56.20]Good.
[120:56.54]Wait.

[120:57.48]I need to always abandon farm.
[121:01.02]Can I like search this place?
[121:08.77]Will there be supplies?
[121:12.73]Why don't you have a boat in here?
[121:29.32]Alright, well this place is dumb.
[121:33.28]Alright, back to the house.
[121:36.20]And then I'm going to try to unlock that new thing.
[121:48.25]What?
[121:49.03]Oh.
[121:52.90]Behavior, looks, carried backpack, or the intensity of crime in the area may affect the decision.
[121:56.42]Try to stay nice and calm around police.
[121:58.32]Don't run from them.
[121:59.14]I'm good.
[122:02.68]I just have $70 in my pocket.
[122:03.98]I am running.
[122:23.96]Money is illegal.
[122:25.12]Book it.
[122:31.20]Money's against the law.
[122:32.96]Where's your credit card?
[122:33.82]Okay.
[122:38.83]I need to... Okay, let's see.

[122:55.28]Alright, let's take a look at the desktop.
[122:56.84]I need the old marketplace.
[122:58.34]I need 700 respect.
[123:02.77]Maybe level 4, I need more respect.
[123:05.99]Hmm.
[123:13.35]Alright, should we set a new price?
[123:14.45]Should I charge?
[123:19.04]Should I drop the... Should I make the price higher?

[206:51.90]In a baggie?
[206:52.96]You don't think there's something wrong with that?
[207:02.81]Alright.

[231:32.44]Where is this dude?
[231:33.28]He's right there.
[231:36.38]Why is everybody saying end of the stream?
[231:37.78]It's not the end of the fucking stream.
[231:42.63]What?
[231:45.99]Okay, here you go.

[231:51.62]And then... Look, I'd like you to try it again.
[231:54.94]Just give it one more try.
[231:56.84]And then you tell me if you think it's gross.
[231:58.58]Did you put it on correctly?
[231:59.77]Did you put it on before you put it in the oven or after?
[232:02.55]Don't tell me you're a fucking idiot and put it on after it came out of the oven.
[232:05.61]Is that what you did?
[232:06.13]Because you must have used it wrong.
[232:09.69]Wait, I can't give him...
[232:21.21]This is 2, 4, 5, 6.
[232:22.71]He doesn't want it.
[232:24.21]2, 4, 5, 6.
[232:24.31]What?
[232:47.48]2 plus 2 equals 6.
[232:48.60]That's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[232:50.60]And then 5, 6.

[258:48.52]Are you just saying like the one gun shots?
[258:52.66]When do I get a gun?
[258:55.56]In fact, actually, I'm kind of happy I don't have a gun.
[259:01.85]Respect on the sway.
[259:03.01]What?
[259:06.21]T. Respect on sale area is very low.
[259:10.85]Low respect negatively affects sales.
[259:12.61]Make more sales, rent, hideouts, or mark territory to regain respect.
[259:18.32]Who doesn't respect me?
[259:20.90]Old Marketplace.
[259:21.68]Oh, wow.
[259:22.12]We're losing respect.
[259:22.96]I have to sell drugs, but I can't until I get the pill smasher thing.
[259:40.53]Maybe it's because you're selling salt in a bag.
[259:42.91]Yeah.
[259:43.57]Alright.
[259:44.51]I'm going to start selling real stuff.
[259:46.13]Alright.

[259:55.62]No.
[259:55.84]Okay.
[259:56.16]I'm going to make real drugs.
[260:06.34]I mean.
[260:06.76]I'm going to get rid of them.
[260:07.56]I'm still going to sell them.
[260:09.86]But.
[260:11.60]You know.
[260:12.70]Alright.

[260:34.71]FDA approved.
[260:36.49]I think there's a bug in my hair in real life.
[260:38.83]And it's freaking me out.
[260:39.61]I'm about to pull it out.
[260:40.29]What is this?
[260:45.58]I actually think this is a piece of small chocolate from the Reese's that I ate earlier.
[260:51.67]Oh, that's just gross.
[260:54.81]Now I have to clean my head.
[261:02.43]I think it's an insect head.
[261:03.61]I think it's an insect leg.
[261:04.90]Maybe, yeah.

[261:38.36]I'm about to get run out of town.
[261:39.42]Okay, we need respect.
[261:41.00]A lot of it.
[261:42.02]How do I get respect?
[261:43.20]How do you get respect?
[261:43.96]How do I get respect?
[261:45.36]Sell stuff people want.

[308:11.29]The big three.
[308:11.99]The big ones.
[308:12.81]The big ones.
[308:13.85]The ones that are everywhere.
[308:15.13]In every city.
[308:16.09]In every town.
[308:17.79]One mile apart from each other.
[308:20.21]Burger King.
[308:20.75]Wendy's.
[308:21.17]McDonald's.
[308:25.66]Another five subs came in from Westule.
[308:27.62]Thank you.
[308:28.70]Thank you, Westule, for the five community subs.
[308:32.39]Take out 250.
[308:32.77]Five one guys.
[308:40.91]No, Five Guys is on a different level.
[308:43.19]It's like on a different tier.
[308:44.91]Of course, obviously, Five Guys is better than McDonald's.
[308:50.91]it's on a different playing field it's more it's like it's not even in the same it's not the same thing they're not the same restaurants it's it's a better restaurant but it's not in the same tier of restaurants it's more yeah it's it but that you can't compare you can't compare like shake shack to McDonald's that doesn't make any sense just hold on while I give this guy some free ecstasy
[309:31.00]Because Shake Shack... Because Shake Shack sucks.
[309:36.01]I say that five times fast.
[309:38.01]Shake Shack sucks.
[309:39.07]Shake Shack sucks.
[309:39.99]Shake Shack... Shake Shack sucks.
[309:43.21]I gotta take my headphones off.
[309:45.25]Shake Shack sucks.
[309:46.29]Shake Shack sucks.
[309:47.31]Shake Shack sucks.
[309:48.58]Shake Shack sucks.
[309:49.56]Hold on, I'll get it.
[309:56.44]I feel like close my eyes and close my ears and shit.
[310:00.14]Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack... I have to... This is what I have to do to get this to work.
[310:19.63]Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks, Shake Shack sucks.
[310:27.21]I got it didn't I?
[310:28.39]I got it right?
[310:38.90]No, no, no, no.
[310:40.52]I love Shake Shack.
[310:41.82]I love Shake Shack.
[310:42.76]I actually really do.
[310:43.32]I think it's fantastic.
[310:44.74]Shake Shack's great.
[310:45.98]Shake Shack slaps.
[310:48.34]Shake Shack slaps, right?
[310:49.66]Does that work?
[310:50.64]Does that work for you guys?
[310:52.34]Shake Shack slaps.
[310:53.64]Shake Shack slaps.
[310:55.15]Shake Shack's great.
[310:56.71]I actually really like Shake Shack a lot.
[310:59.49]So I'm just trying to tell you that was a hard thing to do.
[311:01.85]Hard thing to say.
[311:05.52]I really like it.
[311:06.80]I love Shake Shack.
[311:08.18]It's probably in the top five of fucking medium-sized.
[311:12.59]Not super-sized, like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and KFC!
[311:15.29]KFC's fried chicken.
[311:16.27]What are you, insane?
[311:22.77]Alright.
[311:23.33]Ready.
[311:26.15]Whoa!
[311:26.77]To all units, suspicious individuals spotted around cemetery.
[311:30.85]Over.
[311:32.91]What?
[311:34.15]Oh no, wait.
[311:37.47]Throw the fucking bag.
[311:39.71]I'm right here.
[311:40.23]Oh.
[311:53.58]It's because I dipped around the corner.
[311:57.50]Ugh.
[312:03.31]100 bucks, where's, where, where the, where was that?
[312:08.79]Where, I need to know where that was.
[312:10.13]There was like $400 in that bag.
[312:12.31]Where was that?
[312:15.47]Who knows?
[312:16.81]Somebody has to.
[312:20.67]Where was I, I don't, I don't remember.
[312:24.99]He hates bits.
[312:26.27]Oh shit, 6,900 bits came in, $69.
[312:31.67]Where did it go?
[312:32.31]Right behind the house?
[312:35.43]So... So... Solaris gave $69.
[312:37.35]That's fucking crazy.
[312:42.51]Wait, it was like right here, right?
[312:47.40]Yes!
[312:47.66]There's $420 in there.
[312:48.34]Good.
[312:48.54]Okay, hold on.
[312:50.32]Let me...
[313:02.52]Come on, Eddie.
[313:05.66]Here, take some free stuff.
[313:07.04]Hold on, one second.
[313:07.72]Can we pay, Eddie?
[313:20.40]Here we go, good.
[313:21.21]Alright, I'm in the clear now.
[313:23.29]Let me get the hell back to the house.
[313:25.01]I got a bunch of new clients, probably.
[313:27.97]But, Solaris, thanks for the fucking $69.
[313:29.75]I say, hey, Jerma, happy holidays.
[313:33.17]Happy holidays to you too.
[313:34.37]What holiday is it?
[313:42.03]Happy holidays?
[313:45.73]Happy holidays to you.
[313:47.07]Have a good 420.
[313:51.43]Wait, what?
[313:53.24]What's today?
[313:57.66]Today is 419.
[313:58.80]Wait, I didn't play this game on the right day.
[314:05.36]It's 419.
[314:07.64]Oh, shit.
[314:08.65]I didn't even do that on purpose.
[314:11.43]If it was on purpose, I would have done it today, tomorrow.
[314:15.13]Oh.
[314:16.45]Time zones.
[314:17.01]Yeah, well, happy... If you smoke weed, it's recreationally legal and medically legal in the state that you're currently in, in the jurisdiction you're in.
[314:25.44]By all means, if you enjoy it, do it responsibly and do it privately and do it in a place where you're legally allowed to do it and hope you like it.
[314:31.00]Take care of yourself.
[314:31.80]If it's legal where you are, have fun.
[314:35.90]careful uh anyways uh I spent I just want to say thank you for being the best antidepressant I've ever had I spent most of my adult life as an isolated shut-in seeing everyone else going insane under quarantine is kind of fucking hilarious uh like they just can't watch Twitch forehead I live in Michigan and no one here is taking it seriously so I guess we'll have we'll just die no joke after I bought these bits it left me with 69 in my account nice
[315:04.85]I'll wait for the train to go by.
[315:09.89]Will you... Okay.
[315:22.26]First of all, thanks for the $69.
[315:22.96]I mean, yeah, everyone's going to say nice, nice, right?
[315:26.54]But... It's... The whole lockdown thing and the quarantine thing...
[315:33.72]It's hard for people, it really is, because... At least for... I'm talking just me personally.
[315:39.36]I like to go do things.
[315:43.09]I like to go places.
[315:45.07]And for people that are very, very... Their normal lives are to just be out of their houses...
[315:50.84]It is a pretty huge, major change in their lives.
[315:53.60]So, I mean, it's difficult just to say, well, just continue to stay home.
[315:58.52]You can do it.
[315:59.68]It's like we are describing things that people have never really ever had to do before.
[316:04.49]And some people really, really like to be out of their houses.
[316:07.23]So it is hard.
[316:08.01]It's tough for pretty much everybody.
[316:11.17]But it's necessary.
[316:12.68]That's the thing.
[316:13.14]That's the next part of that.
[316:20.90]Normally I shut it and even I'm going crazy.
[316:23.95]think it's it's not just it's not about going crazy in quotes I think what see where I get kind of annoyed and sad and irritated by this whole thing is just knowing that there's a bunch of people that are just they can't go to work and they can't do anything and it's like you're almost in like this this state of complete limbo and I I feel so terrible for those people that have to go through this essential workers that are have to be
[316:51.93]at their job every day they have to be they have to be there because they know how important what they're doing is it's tricky all around I really hope we get over this I really hope it is something that can realistically in the next few months hopefully we can seriously just try to get back to somewhere where we can even leave our houses
[317:15.03]Without just being in our cars or being able to get out of your car and go somewhere and do something.
[317:21.68]Go to work without a problem.
[317:24.28]So, but it's hard.
[317:26.30]People aren't used to this shit.
[317:27.58]We've never had to do this before.
[317:30.64]This is something we've never had to do before, ever.
[317:33.97]And it's just like, here, you gotta do it now.
[317:35.27]And it's like, oh, fuck, okay, well, we gotta do that now.
[317:38.09]And people are doing it.
[317:39.51]There are, yeah, there are some cases, obviously, in a lot of, you've seen the pictures, I've seen them too, of like, oh, who cares?
[317:47.04]We're at stay-at-home orders, but let's just go to the fucking beach, right?
[317:50.48]And it's just like, okay, what the fuck are you doing, right?
[318:00.13]People going out to buy shoe cakes.
[318:04.83]Hold on a second there.
[318:06.59]Wait a minute.
[318:08.81]Already actively assuming that I... Well, you don't understand.
[318:14.20]That was made by my mother.
[318:18.74]My mother made that and shipped it to me.
[318:23.68]That's where that came from.
[318:25.42]What a great mother this guy's got, by the way.
[318:31.55]Mom, I need a shoe.
[318:33.25]Oh, I got you.
[318:34.17]Okay.
[318:36.33]That's it.
[318:39.99]Mod your mom.
[318:41.24]Oh, fuck.
[318:41.60]Time's going by.
[318:42.12]I gotta pause.
[318:43.24]But, uh, Solaris.
[318:48.19]I know that this, depending on what state you're in, I know especially if you live in a place like New York, New York is all over the place right now.
[318:56.24]It's difficult to know exactly what's going to happen because they have almost, what, 30, 40% of all the cases are in New York.
[319:02.96]That's just, that's fucked.
[319:05.94]We're in a really kind of fucking weird time right now for everybody, especially if you're in one of these hot zones.
[319:12.93]So it's realistically just about trying to just follow the guidelines and hopefully we can get over this and vaccines can get produced.
[319:21.26]Everybody wants the same thing.
[319:27.84]But thanks for the $69.
[319:33.18]Really appreciate it.
[319:33.82]Thanks for hanging out.
[319:41.09]I know we're talking about some serious, I probably should have paused the game and put the music and dialog on zero.
[319:50.80]I'm sitting here talking about, like, yo, let me tell you something.
[319:54.18]Let's talk about this.
[319:55.24]It's very important stuff.
[319:58.73]It's like trains going by, people screaming outside.
[320:01.27]Alright.
[320:03.49]Let's go back to what we were doing.
[320:07.47]And what were we doing exactly?
[320:08.97]Oh yeah, we were fucking cutting up ecstasy and putting fillers in it and selling it to people.
[320:19.14]Alright.
[320:21.33]Can I clean my office?
[320:22.79]This is not an office.
[320:23.85]Yes it is.
[320:24.23]Of course it is.
[320:27.73]Alright.
[320:28.37]What do my orders look like?
[320:33.99]Okay, thanks.
[320:34.87]Your total debt was $3.50.
[320:36.57]I did it.
[320:36.87]I got cash.
[320:38.95]Okay, we're going to need to collect the money from that.
[320:41.95]We need six grams of marijuana.
[320:43.49]Urgent.
[320:46.44]Eight grams of marijuana.
[320:50.54]Ten grams of marijuana.
[320:51.92]Damn, do I have that?
[320:53.70]I do, right?
[320:55.44]Yeah, I do.
[320:55.80]Of course I do.
[320:56.26]I'm prepared.
[321:06.67]And we got our money.
[321:08.37]Make sure I don't have any bullshit here.
[321:12.43]Put the cash away.
[321:14.53]The ecstasy.
[321:15.45]No, keep the ecstasy.
[321:16.45]Give it to people for free.
[321:20.04]Should take a break soon?
[321:21.86]Yeah, I'll probably be done streaming in the next 30-40 minutes.
[321:25.72]Something like that.
[321:28.90]I think I like this game.
[321:29.94]I kind of want to keep playing it.
[321:33.35]But I've got stuff to do tomorrow and Tuesday.
[321:36.78]Like, why do I have to have responsibilities to do?
[321:39.58]I don't want to do that.
[321:41.50]I want to sell virtual drugs to people.
[321:52.75]Let's go get the money first.
[322:02.57]Postmates?
[322:03.81]Um, I can't postmates... I can't postmates my dog to the vet.
[322:08.81]That's not... I can't do that.
[322:10.01]200 bucks!
[322:11.09]Nice.
[322:19.79]Please play this.
[322:20.73]Wait, finally, somebody's calling me.
[322:21.99]Finally.
[322:23.57]Eddie, what's up?

[322:27.91]Ooh.
[322:50.01]Rent a new hideout.
[322:51.96]Not yet.
[322:52.38]Oh, fuck!
[322:56.62]There's a guy!
[322:57.28]This game is cringe.
[323:08.86]Is that a police officer?
[323:09.72]Why is there so many police officers here?
[323:10.98]Oh, there's a hideout here.
[323:20.54]Wait, let me sell this stuff.
[323:27.18]I need to keep my operation going.

[323:51.12]Like, you can tell that guy's on drugs.
[323:53.91]If your dealer jumps the fence like that... Yeah.
[323:57.33]You can probably be aware that they're probably doing something.
[323:59.97]Hey, do you want something for free?

[326:00.53]You can use hideouts for waiting, refuge, and most of them save stations, which can be crucial for your progress.
[326:06.48]To rent a hideout, you need to use a bank amount, preferably legal.

[330:56.90]Did I do this?
[331:01.74]Where's the... Do I have a... Do I not have a door?
[331:07.22]In a hideout, you can launch the furniture but by holding space.
[331:12.73]Cool.
[331:12.83]How do I put this down?
[331:14.07]Oh shit these are stackable!
[331:59.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[332:00.78]Yeah.
[332:01.48]Ooh.
[332:03.72]Ooh.
[332:13.96]Nice.
[332:14.28]Okay.
[332:15.36]Ooh.
[332:17.23]I have an... What is this?
[332:18.97]Oh, the sink.
[332:21.09]Hold on a second.
[332:21.55]Wait, can I actually... Wait, this is the wet thing.
[332:24.69]Why is there no sink in my other house?
[332:26.09]Wait, there is.
[332:28.36]I have a bathroom.
[332:29.54]I couldn't because I can wet the marijuana in the bathroom sink.
[332:32.42]Who is it?
[332:32.76]Hey, what up?
[332:35.94]Listen, I hear that lazy moron Donald came back from his vacation and reopened the furniture store.
[332:43.07]You might want to check that out.
[332:44.65]You might need some more storage space or equipment soon.
[332:47.87]Talk later.
[332:48.47]Okay, bye.
[332:49.21]Okay, cool.
[332:54.71]So now what are my tasks?
[332:56.81]I have to unlock the new sale areas and I have to addict five people.
[333:02.70]Oh, I already went into the furniture shop.
[333:04.12]Alright, I checked out the furniture shop here.
[333:20.26]Yeah, yeah, cool, nice.
[333:21.80]Alright, I checked it out.
[333:22.84]Oh, I leave.
[333:25.13]That count is checking it out?
[333:31.87]Alright, well, there's no save point in there though.
[333:46.56]Imagine buying soaking wet weed.
[334:03.58]Is that the game?
[334:04.38]Yeah.
[334:05.84]Alright, I am going to call it here.
[334:11.40]I'm gonna try to adhere to the rules that I set for myself a couple weeks ago.
[334:15.71]It's the rule.
[334:18.83]Doctor's orders rules.
[334:21.37]I have to adhere to them.
[334:23.07]I have to.
[334:23.85]If I want to actually make my body better.
[334:26.11]It's a Funko Pop quitter.
[334:30.95]Fuck the rules.
[334:34.08]You streamed for 8 hours yesterday.
[334:35.42]Yeah, I know.
[334:36.28]I'm not supposed to be doing that.
[334:42.28]Don't eat McDonald's.
[334:43.02]You ate McDonald's though.
[334:43.94]McDonald's has nothing to do with my bones.
[334:47.08]What?
[334:49.68]I want to play this game more.
[334:50.52]I want to play this game more.
[334:59.23]How do I do that?
[335:01.41]How do I play this game more?
[335:04.53]We might have to do some schedule changing here.
[335:18.86]I can't play it tomorrow.
[335:19.72]I can't stream tomorrow.
[335:22.54]Ah, and then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[335:24.61]Okay, hold on.
[335:27.51]I figured out what the mystery game is.
[335:30.45]It's 420.
[335:30.63]I did play it on 420 Eastern Time.
[335:38.11]Alright.
[335:39.27]Listen to me.
[335:40.35]This is important.
[335:41.47]Are you ready?
[335:44.84]So I'm going to change the schedule a little.
[335:49.60]We're going to play.
[335:51.04]This is the mystery game because I want to play this more.
[335:54.32]The mystery game was supposed to be on Friday.
[335:57.34]But, excuse me, the mystery game is moving to Wednesday.
[336:00.69]So, mystery game is going to happen on Wednesday.
[336:02.41]Thursday is going to be the movie night.
[336:04.51]Friday.
[336:04.87]No.
[336:05.39]Yeah.
[336:05.91]No.
[336:06.57]Thursday is going to be.
[336:07.21]How are we going to do this?
[336:10.63]Thursday will be community content night.
[336:12.21]Friday will be movie night.
[336:14.29]Saturday will be Easy Bake Oven.
[336:20.97]I think that works.
[336:22.69]Movie night makes sense on Friday night.
[336:24.31]That's a good time to do it.
[336:28.27]And then Saturday is Easy Bake Oven.
[336:32.13]Yeah, that works.
[336:33.53]What about Saw the Game?
[336:34.88]Yeah, I want to play this again, though.
[336:42.36]Yeah, I'll have a couple glasses of wine on movie night.
[336:51.76]Who saw on the next mystery game?
[336:58.78]I haven't.
[336:59.78]I just can't find a reason to play it.
[337:01.36]Alright, so that's the plan.
[337:06.02]We're going to come back with this in a couple days on Wednesday.
[337:07.82]And then we're going to do it on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[337:12.63]And there's a lot of shit to do this week coming up.
[337:15.59]That's the plan.
[337:16.87]That's what we're going to do.
[337:19.57]See you on Wednesday.
[337:25.80]Thanks for watching, as always.
[337:26.76]I had a lot of fun.
[337:28.60]That's why I want to play it again.
[337:30.70]Take care of yourselves.
[337:31.48]We'll see you soon.
[337:33.60]Save the game?
[337:34.34]Yes, I will.
[337:35.32]I'm not going to play even one second without you.
[337:37.44]I promise.
[337:41.40]Here it is.
[337:41.64]See?
[337:43.36]So, we'll see you tomorrow.
[337:44.72]No!
[337:45.34]Not tomorrow.
[337:45.88]I'm so dumb.
[337:46.96]We'll see you... We'll see you on Wednesday.
[337:51.73]Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[337:54.95]Hey, the chef's corner.
[337:56.01]10 more community subs.
[337:57.27]What does that make?
[337:57.89]Like 50?
[337:58.55]60 tonight?
[337:59.87]From the chef?
[338:03.57]10, 20, 30.
[338:06.74]That's 35 community subs.
[338:11.28]You have to do 420.
[338:12.22]No, I did it on 420.
[338:13.50]I played it for 30 minutes on 420.
[338:15.24]See you guys in a couple days.
[338:20.73]Thanks for watching.
[338:22.01]Much love to you.
[338:22.61]Get some sleep.
[338:26.50]Fix your Reddit room.
[338:27.56]Don't worry, I'll rearrange it and make it look even better.
[338:32.32]See you guys soon.
[338:35.10]Thank you to The Chef's Corner, not only for your insane monetary contributions throughout the course of the night with your huge bits and your huge community subs, but you also gave $10 earlier as well.
[338:50.67]Find your webcam mic and peek it right now.
[338:57.62]I can't do that.
[338:59.46]Okay, I promise.
[339:03.10]There you go.
[339:03.56]I peaked it.
[339:04.16]I peaked it by smacking into you.
[339:05.92]Alright, listen.
[339:08.36]On like the 30 webcam stream, I'm going to try to break one of the webcam mics as hard as I can.
[339:16.86]I will put my mouth... I'm going to just scream in the room and there'll be 30 different webcams screaming all at different delays.
[339:25.49]I promise I will do that at least once.
[339:31.84]Plus, we got to plan that one out because I'm soon here.
[339:34.57]I'm going to start to try to do the process when they come back in stock to buy them.
[339:41.41]and remember we're talking about I'm gonna do I'm gonna fight I'm gonna have a brawl in the room I'm gonna fight myself with 30 different people I'm gonna chop myself up into like 10 at least 20 different pieces to do a puzzle put myself back together again um I'm going to try to have a conversation a full conversation with 30 people
[340:08.06]It's gonna fail?
[340:08.82]Oh, no, it will not.
[340:10.50]It's gonna work out very well.
[340:16.26]Do a concert?
[340:17.16]Yeah.
[340:18.50]Do a full singing concert?
[340:25.58]You did the webcam delay joke.
[340:27.18]Yeah, I know, with the top rope.
[340:29.08]That was with two.
[340:30.96]What happens when you add, like, 15 more combatants?
[340:35.19]All delayed at different times.
[340:36.43]Because you can delay a webcam on OBS by like a full, almost a full minute.
[340:43.03]Two minutes.
[340:44.28]Maybe more than that.
[340:49.04]This is going to be crazy.
[340:52.10]Yeah, I will.
[340:52.74]Jeff, I will peek it.
[340:53.62]I promise.
[340:54.82]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[340:55.80]Hey, Jerma, thank you for playing Jackie Chan Adventures as the mystery game later this week.
[341:00.38]Oh.
[341:02.32]Mystery game is going to be not a mystery anymore, because it's going to be Crack Crew?
[341:09.93]What's it called?
[341:10.85]Drug Dealer?
[341:11.43]I don't know what the game's called.
[341:12.91]Thank you, Sticks Renegade, for the $2.50.
[341:17.53]And another $2.50!
[341:19.90]Sorry, I mean Stuntmaster.
[341:23.95]The actual lore?
[341:24.35]Kinda fucked up.
[341:46.71]LM, man, thanks for the $5.
[341:47.99]Jeremy, I'm only giving you these bits so I can call you out.
[341:50.15]Uh-oh.
[341:51.97]You were an inspiration to us all.
[341:54.39]And now you are nothing more than a greed-infused drug dealer.
[341:59.69]No, it's fake.
[342:00.49]It's all, it's all, it's all, it's make-believe.
[342:02.99]It's like when you used to go hang out when you were a little kid and make Play-Doh food.
[342:08.88]That's what this is.
[342:09.40]This is my Play-Doh food.
[342:10.44]It's just Play-Doh food.
[342:11.38]There's nothing else.
[342:16.91]Big Mama, thanks for the $15.
[342:18.45]1500 bits from Big Mama.
[342:21.19]This is great.
[342:21.79]I love drugs and crime.
[342:24.02]Well, I hope that's not true.
[342:27.36]Thanks for the $15.
[342:27.86]For real though, thanks for the $5.
[342:31.72]Two things, Jerma.
[342:32.50]Okay.
[342:33.42]1.
[342:34.14]Marijuana was originally spelled with an H, but it was replaced to a J, so it would be more associated with Mexican immigrants. 2.
[342:43.18]2.
[342:44.84]How do you feel about the lack of proper bots in modern games, particularly shooters?
[342:54.06]What do you mean?
[342:54.42]The lack of bots?
[342:56.44]Like when you play CSGO versus like Botville, Botfrank, Bot... As you mean?
[343:07.52]I think it's because so many people play them now.
[343:10.83]Why program bots when you have a shooter, but people are just going to play it anyways?
[343:17.61]I think too many people play online shooters now.
[343:20.87]Where would you put bots in like a Battlegrounds game?
[343:24.49]Unless it's like PUBG Mobile.
[343:27.96]Too many people play them.
[343:29.22]I mean, you could do like an offline mode, I guess, maybe.
[343:39.38]Perfect Dark had awesome bots.
[343:40.78]Perfect Dark also had the best weapon in any game.
[343:42.61]The one where you could shoot and see through walls.
[343:47.21]That was the worst thing ever.
[343:48.57]And it was an instant kill.
[343:49.41]I remember getting so angry and being so happy when I had that.
[343:54.17]Or when I got killed by that.
[343:55.91]It was horrible.
[343:58.29]Yes, in the original Perfect Dark for Nintendo 64, the weapon was called Farsight.
[344:03.46]And what it did is it let you see through every wall and thermo-outlined every other player.
[344:10.12]And you could shoot through every single wall.
[344:12.30]You just had to target them and kill them instantly.
[344:20.07]And it was in the game, yes.
[344:25.29]Anyways, thanks for the $5.00.
[344:28.38]Hey, Omnicash, thanks for the 300 bits.
[344:30.42]The first time I catch your stream and this is what I see.
[344:33.78]We're just making Play-Doh hamburgers.
[344:37.70]And I ate a couple of Play-Doh hamburgers earlier, so it's all good.
[344:43.04]Omnicash, again, $5.
[344:45.32]This should be enough to buy some whipped cream.
[344:48.60]I can't believe none of you guys did that.
[344:52.87]That's a guy gave it bonkers to me not even one time when you were like kid or anything Mr. Lester Thank you.
[345:04.86]Mr. Lester for the five dollars Jerma never been able to catch a stream till today It's nice to hear your voice live We are live But hey welcome Thanks for checking out the stream.
[345:18.30]Hope you liked it Thanks with five dollars
[345:24.06]DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[345:25.20]Hey man, really great stream and hope to see you return to VR one day.
[345:28.50]You will.
[345:32.02]And the VR is going to be way better.
[345:35.56]Because I'm going to have a better space for it.
[345:40.37]I'm going to have probably two times more space when I set it up.
[345:47.11]So instead of being in a small little office cube, I'm going to make sure I'm in a bigger room.
[345:57.59]not a reddit room but actually the reddit yeah actually you know this is this is accurate the reddit room is bigger I have a much bigger reddit room now so I'm able to do it so there'll be more I'll be able to actually remember how many times I'd be like what the fuck is that I can't even why is it not tracking me oh fuck is that the wall
[346:28.13]That will not happen.
[346:28.98]I will be able to full stride walk around like a dickhead.
[346:32.78]Looking forward to it.
[346:37.26]But yeah, we will return.
[346:40.01]If you ever do go back, though, if you ever set up Skyrim VR properly, you can get porn mods and make everyone think you're playing Skyrim, but no, it's porn.
[346:53.46]I'm not going to get porn mods.
[346:55.98]I would get suspended from Twitch.
[346:58.43]They would remove me from the platform.
[347:04.57]A Vimthral.
[347:05.37]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[347:06.57]This one's going to be hard to read.
[347:09.39]This one's going to be very hard to read.
[347:11.01]In fact, I'm not going to read it.
[347:12.87]It's just fucking weird.
[347:16.42]It's, uh...
[347:24.48]It says, no, drug man, don't put your feet in the mash.
[347:26.94]Ha ha ha.
[347:28.10]Your feet will get so sticky and gross.
[347:29.54]Ha ha, the mash will feel gross on their face.
[347:33.86]What?
[347:34.02]Okay, thanks for the three bucks.
[347:37.10]Anonymous Cheer, thanks for the $2.50.
[347:38.35]Just anonymous.
[347:41.97]Mitchell, thanks for the $5.00.
[347:43.17]And once again, this shit is fucked.
[347:44.61]Thanks to the Drug Grub Girls.
[347:49.45]The Drug Grub.
[347:50.53]The Drug of Girls.
[347:55.21]Oh, the Powerpuff Girls thing.
[347:56.51]Right.
[347:58.09]Right, right, right.
[348:00.51]Hey, S10W update.
[348:02.51]Slow update.
[348:04.09]Thanks for the $2.50.
[348:04.63]Hey, Jerma, I love this Half-Life multiplayer dark RP.
[348:08.38]I read this earlier because I thought it was funny.
[348:11.02]Anyways, glad to see you again.
[348:12.56]Not sure if I'm stepping out of line here, but I'd love to see you play BioShock 2 on stream.
[348:19.06]A personal favorite of mine.
[348:21.02]Anyways, glad to watch you again.
[348:22.05]Peace and love.
[348:24.89]I've played through BioShock Infinite.
[348:28.13]I watched somebody play through all of BioShock, and BioShock 2 did not exist in my brain.
[348:35.24]So, that's the one that I have not actually done or seen.
[348:42.38]And people say that's the good one, right?
[348:46.39]Although people say BioShock 1 is more storyline-wise is actually more interesting versus BioShock 2's gameplay improvements.
[348:54.27]Am I correct here?
[348:54.93]Okay.
[349:04.63]Just making sure I got it right.
[349:07.19]But yeah, I mean, I'm not... I can't say I wouldn't.
[349:09.83]It's a fantastic series.
[349:11.65]The series is great.
[349:14.11]Eventually, yeah.
[349:16.85]I still have to play Doom, but I probably never will.
[349:20.32]Mitchell, thanks for the $5.
[349:21.08]I figured this game out.
[349:23.22]You're a synthetic human made specifically for the purpose of being an expert drug dealer.
[349:28.40]That's why you're the only dealer and why the cops are only interested in you and why the inventory screen doesn't show your face.
[349:34.71]You become good enough and are released and they move on to the next sin.
[349:43.23]That's an interesting theory.
[349:46.33]LM man, thanks for the 250.
[349:48.15]Jerma, have you ever played Heavy Rain?
[349:49.69]We've gone over Heavy Rain a few times.
[349:54.18]I know everything about the whole game.
[349:55.92]I know the whole story.
[349:56.88]I know the spoilers.
[349:57.68]I know how it ends.
[349:58.88]I know how it begins.
[350:00.98]So, I only really like to play games on this stream that I don't know anything about.
[350:07.86]Unless it's one of those games that I love so much that I want to show you guys.
[350:11.64]Because I like it so much.
[350:14.71]So I won't be playing Heavy Rain.
[350:17.45]There's a lot of games that I won't play.
[350:20.13]Just because I already know the whole thing.
[350:22.03]I've already played it before.
[350:24.05]I like this stream to be genuinely things I've never done before.
[350:29.83]Because it makes it more interesting for me.
[350:35.91]Like Beautiful Joe.
[350:38.95]Yeah, but that falls into the category of things that I really love and wanted to show you.
[350:45.91]And that backfired.
[350:48.39]So that falls in that category.
[350:56.20]Binding of Isaac?
[350:58.74]Binding of Isaac is a game that's different every time.
[351:02.64]You won't see the same thing every time when you play Binding of Isaac.
[351:05.38]It's a different game every time.
[351:06.50]That's the nature of the game.
[351:08.38]Next question, please.
[351:16.58]What do you mean false?
[351:17.26]How is that not true?
[351:20.76]No two Binding of Isaac games are the same.
[351:24.70]They can have very, very close similarities, but you're not going to get the same exact experience every single time.
[351:32.29]That's one of my favorite games.
[351:33.23]Don't you dare make fun of it.
[351:38.15]Let's show the credits.
[351:39.51]I'm gonna bump you right in the face here.
[351:41.41]I'm just warning you.
[351:42.09]Here it comes.
[351:42.41]Just watch out.
[351:44.75]Played No More Heroes 2 already.
[351:46.15]Jesus Christ.
[351:49.05]Man.
[351:51.10]A lot of 2s that I have to... Just be happy that we actually played Black and White 2.
[351:55.14]You know what I mean?
[351:59.12]Like, that's another 2 that we did at least.
[352:02.10]I'm gonna play Mario Galaxy.
[352:05.64]I don't know.
[352:06.70]When am I gonna do anything?
[352:11.64]I want no more heroes too.
[352:16.30]Who's the artist that made this for you?
[352:18.32]That would be Blordow.
[352:21.08]Very, very funny.
[352:21.83]Very, very, very, very talented person.
[352:29.09]Got a great style.
[352:31.49]He's got a really, really unique way that he does everything.
[352:33.71]Him and I have known each other for a very long time.
[352:39.70]It's great.
[352:41.80]You promised Patapon.
[352:42.98]Yeah, I almost promised... I promised I was going to eat a shoe, and that happened like three months after I said it.
[352:50.65]A promise is still a promise if it does happen.
[352:52.99]He promised Toontown.
[352:59.86]And you're going to get Toontown, just not right this second.
[353:02.66]He's an eternal liar.
[353:06.78]Fine, just keep it like that.
[353:08.71]I'm an eternal liar.
[353:13.12]Hey, thanks Dark Soul for the $2.50 Cheesecake Factory Smokehouse Barbecue Burger is great.
[353:18.59]Also, Five Guys sucks.
[353:20.41]It's like $13 for a bacon cheeseburger, and you may as well get a diner burger or restaurant takeout burger at that price.
[353:30.52]Listen, regardless of how you feel about Five Guys, the restaurant's quality is better than McDonald's.
[353:41.26]It just is.
[353:42.96]The restaurant's quality is higher than McDonald's.
[353:46.77]That doesn't mean that, but they're completely different restaurants.
[353:56.47]You cannot compare.
[353:58.49]Five Guys at McDonald's.
[353:59.92]They're doing completely different things.
[354:02.99]One of those restaurants has an incredible, huge menu of tons of different things, McChickens, cheap.
[354:11.85]Is it like the greatest quality?
[354:15.31]I mean, probably not, no.
[354:17.76]But it's good, it's food, it's hearty, it makes you feel good.
[354:22.08]Well, after maybe six or seven hours, maybe you feel a little bloated, but if you eat too much, if you don't eat too much, you'll be fine.
[354:27.46]Versus the other place, which is expensive,
[354:32.36]Great.
[354:32.70]The hamburger quality is very good.
[354:34.11]Uh, but the points get knocked off a little bit when they give you the bag of, uh, of just ground, essentially julienned up potatoes.
[354:42.57]Uh, in a bag that weighs like six and a half pounds.
[354:44.97]So.
[354:53.89]Not a fan of the Five Guys fries.
[354:56.01]At all.
[354:57.71]It's, they're just like, they're just, just sliced up potato pieces.
[355:02.59]That they just stuff in a bag and it just weighs the bag down.
[355:04.96]The bag gets all heavy and like oily on the bottom.
[355:08.12]And it's just like potato-y.
[355:09.32]I don't know.
[355:09.84]I don't like them.
[355:19.89]They're very potatoey.
[355:21.91]I like my French fries to be shoestring.
[355:24.01]I like them uniform.
[355:25.87]I like them to be able to be pushed in, folded, and crunched in my mouth.
[355:30.44]I don't like thick... I hate potato wedges.
[355:33.00]Let's make that clear.
[355:34.60]I don't like thick potato wedges or thick cut potatoey fries.
[355:41.05]Potato wedges don't do it for me.
[355:43.11]It's too much starch, too like mushy and starchy in your mouth.
[355:47.87]No.
[355:48.85]Not for me.
[355:49.79]Maybe for you, not for me.
[355:55.99]What?
[355:58.41]What about waffle fries?
[355:59.25]They're incredible.
[356:04.90]The skin... The skin of potato wedges is like Reese's paper.
[356:12.81]I didn't say that.
[356:14.89]I did not say that.
[356:16.27]Somebody else did.
[356:17.75]So you can be mad at that person, not me.
[356:22.92]That's fucking hilarious.
[356:25.92]I'm going to use that from now on.
[356:27.82]It's very good.
[356:28.72]That was like a solid 8.8 out of 10 comment.
[356:34.14]It's like Reese's paper.
[356:38.07]Oh, potatoes are gross.
[356:41.71]Yuck.
[356:44.84]Anyways.
[356:48.48]8.7.
[356:48.50]8.9.
[356:48.52]I don't know.
[356:49.97]What did the Hulk get?
[356:50.85]8.9.
[356:52.07]I thought Hulk got 8.8.
[356:59.15]Now that I think about it, I don't really like potatoes.
[357:03.76]I really kind of just don't.
[357:06.98]I remember.
[357:07.86]This is a real story.
[357:09.52]Are you ready to get the truth here?
[357:11.78]I remember...
[357:14.73]ordering HelloFresh.
[357:18.03]Okay?
[357:18.53]HelloFresh is a subscription service for food.
[357:22.19]It seemed like a, whoa, this is interesting.
[357:23.67]Let me, let me, let's try this.
[357:25.81]Yeah, that sounds good.
[357:27.27]And it was Kim, I, Etalyx.
[357:30.47]It was like, this sounds like a good idea.
[357:31.61]This makes sense.
[357:32.76]You know, we can just have food here.
[357:33.92]We can cook it and it just gets sent to us.
[357:35.88]Whatever.
[357:36.18]We tried it like other people have tried in the past.
[357:39.18]And
[357:42.42]Every meal, almost every single one, at least 7 out of 10 of these meals, all just had fucking potato chunks for their side.
[357:53.29]It was like, oh, hamburger and potato chunks.
[357:57.65]Ooh, how about this green bean casserole with potato chunks on the side?
[358:01.93]Mmm, steak with potato chunks.
[358:07.60]Salmon with potato chunks.
[358:13.77]And it's like this is fucking stupid I want I don't eat like but I don't eat like home fries with every single meal Why are you not eating rice?
[358:34.39]are you talking about what I don't want I don't want to eat like potato cubes every meal does that make me weird or crazy no what I there was like five or six out of ten meals were just potato cubes or potato wedges potato cubes potato wedges home fries potato keys potato wedges potato fries potato potato potato
[359:04.94]And that's not even why I canceled it.
[359:07.71]You know why I actually decided that we weren't going to get that service anymore?
[359:15.45]This is real.
[359:16.05]This is like a review.
[359:17.87]This is a review of that service.
[359:19.28]Although this is like a year and a half ago.
[359:20.90]So don't take this review that seriously, I guess.
[359:22.62]Because maybe they've changed it.
[359:24.24]Packages would be fucking open.
[359:27.08]Like, we'd get meat sent to us, and like one of the packages of meat would just be fucking open and like leaking.
[359:33.28]Like, okay, great.
[359:34.10]Throw this in the trash now.
[359:35.20]Thanks a lot.
[359:35.56]What's the best restaurant in Vegas?
[359:47.45]That's Hash House.
[359:48.05]I'll go with the link.
[359:50.10]Or Carson Kitchen downtown.
[359:55.83]They had a fucking refund.
[359:57.79]I just was like... Okay, let me just tell you.
[360:00.88]Let me be very, very clear.
[360:02.20]It only happened maybe like three or four times.
[360:05.72]But on the third or fourth time of that happening, it's like, alright.
[360:09.82]No thanks.
[360:10.64]Don't want to do this anymore.
[360:13.22]So, you know, you get like three strikes in my opinion with something like that.
[360:17.15]Goodbye.
[360:26.07]This is my opinion, this is my opinion, this is my real opinion of some of these food services.
[360:31.81]This just really happened.
[360:33.13]I've really made a phone call and really talked about this and really said, hey, please cancel because I don't want you to send me food that's just fucking open.
[360:38.38]And they were like, okay.
[360:39.94]I was like, okay, bye.
[360:42.20]Thank you.
[360:50.30]Remember, your opinions are as consistent as your schedule.
[360:54.94]I don't have a schedule, so that's fine.
[360:58.22]What schedule are you talking about?
[361:00.07]The one that doesn't exist?
[361:00.83]It's all, it doesn't matter.
[361:05.89]All my opinions are my own, right?
[361:09.97]By the way, um, why do people say that?
[361:17.27]Like if you, okay, if you work for a company and it's like, by the way, I just want to let you guys know my opinions are my own.
[361:22.83]Like, what, did B&B Realty not sanction you talking about how, like, you shit your pants today?
[361:31.26]Did they, like, tell you to say that?
[361:35.74]They can say shit and not get fired.
[361:43.03]All my opinions are my own opinions.
[361:46.27]Alright.
[361:47.57]But isn't that just true anyways?
[361:56.84]I thought you were ending it's also pertinent to if you serve in the military that makes sense they're saying that their opinions are theirs and not their companies but what if their companies are not in their biographies
[362:18.66]Okay, what if you're just like, Jake Stevenson is my Twitter profile.
[362:23.29]I don't tell you who I work for.
[362:25.31]That's just my profile.
[362:27.19]I'm just Jake Stevenson.
[362:28.33]People are going to find out who you work for and then ask the employer if that's what they...
[362:48.45]Covering the trail did you not know this no I like I know I understand like why the bit but like At the same time I was always thinking like wait if isn't if your opinions aren't you you have to say that a Company a company's really that annoying Jake Jerma985 Stevenson Hey don't talk about the perfume you bought I
[363:13.93]It's me from B&B Realty.
[363:17.34]What did you say?
[363:18.08]Let me look.
[363:22.22]You better tell people that it wasn't me that said that.
[363:25.40]No, it's not because it's not you.
[363:27.12]It's me saying it.
[363:28.78]Are you sure?
[363:30.78]People say that I said that.
[363:34.02]No, it's my profile.
[363:36.76]I'm typing it.
[363:40.28]I have my eyes on you, Jake.
[363:48.87]By the way, you're working on Sunday.
[364:03.14]Fucking asshole.
[364:06.84]That was a State Farm joke?
[364:09.63]Wait, they did what?
[364:14.39]Wait, that happened?
[364:15.85]This happens in a State Farm commercial?
[364:29.66]Anyways, thanks.
[364:30.52]Who even said that?
[364:32.06]Who told me that?
[364:32.62]Somebody said that.
[364:36.08]Who said that?
[364:37.00]Why are we talking about that?
[364:38.82]Who said that?
[364:40.08]Oh, yeah.
[364:40.52]Potato witches are gross.
[364:41.68]That's it.
[364:42.36]There you go.
[364:42.98]Opinions are my own.
[364:45.22]Opinions are my own and not representative of the Jerma985 Enterprises.
[364:49.30]But guess what?
[364:50.60]They are.
[364:51.02]They are.
[364:56.74]It's me too.
[365:03.18]I like potato wedges, you little fuck.
[365:08.58]Delete that tweet.
[365:16.92]Hey, Art Vanderlay, thanks for the five dollars.
[365:21.26]I'm watching this stream from work right now.
[365:23.00]I work in a first responder station.
[365:24.56]I've been pulling 60 plus hour weeks.
[365:27.98]And your stream is helping keep me sane and less stressed.
[365:31.00]Thanks for that.
[365:33.83]Thanks for doing what you're doing.
[365:37.06]What you're doing is exponentially more important.
[365:42.66]Thank you for the $5.
[365:43.20]And thanks for continuing to do that shit.
[365:47.90]Because it can be a lot.
[365:58.24]No, it's not $4.20.
[366:00.68]Thanks for the $5.
[366:05.97]Hopefully, you can get a break soon from all this.
[366:12.11]Take care of yourself.
[366:15.36]Crypto, thanks for the thousand bits.
[366:17.32]Hi, Jerma.
[366:17.90]A friend told me about you a year ago.
[366:20.34]I've been watching your VODs ever since.
[366:25.17]Sorry, I ate two or three McChickens and a Big Mac in like fucking eight minutes.
[366:28.99]Give me a minute.
[366:30.51]Wait a minute, did it happen?
[366:31.77]Is it there or no?
[366:32.95]It almost happened.
[366:33.51]Uh, Jared, my friend told me about you a year ago and I've been watching your VODs ever since.
[366:38.69]God, I haven't been able to watch you live because of the time zone difference.
[366:42.23]Been meaning to donate for a long time, so here, feed your love for McChickens.
[366:45.93]Funny you bring that up.
[366:48.09]That's funny you say that.
[366:50.15]Um, I will.
[366:51.93]I will.
[366:58.50]Chef's Corner, thanks for 10 more dollars on top of the hundreds today.
[367:03.66]Thanks a lot.
[367:05.32]Love you all.
[367:05.90]Hope you all survive this crazy quarantine shit.
[367:07.80]Have a good night.
[367:09.20]Right back at you.
[367:11.52]Thank you so much, Chef's Corner.
[367:12.65]Appreciate it.
[367:14.83]Let's show the subs.
[367:18.53]Show them.
[367:22.11]Here they come.
[367:23.61]Roll them.
[367:24.33]These are all the community subs, all the regular subs, all the long-term, new-term, everybody.
[367:29.45]Thanks a lot, guys.
[367:38.58]Ungrateful streamer hates donations.
[367:40.32]Why does everybody capitalize hates?
[367:44.92]Why can't you lowercase it?
[367:46.12]It makes me sound bad.
[367:47.08]No, but thank you guys, seriously.
[367:51.53]All of you.
[367:52.77]All of your subscriptions.
[367:54.59]You don't have to do it.
[367:56.19]You're never obligated to.
[367:59.59]But a lot of you still do.
[368:00.69]All I can say is thanks.
[368:05.91]Apple Shift, thanks for $2.50.
[368:06.91]Hey, y'all.
[368:09.05]Have you ever played The Last of Us?
[368:10.87]It's pretty dialog and cutscene heavy, but I just played it for the first time last week.
[368:15.44]It was so good.
[368:17.12]I'm bummed that the second game is delayed indefinitely, though.
[368:20.86]I have played The Last of Us.
[368:22.82]Although I've never finished The Last of Us.
[368:25.67]The Last of Us sits in that same category of God of War.
[368:30.44]Where I put more than probably 10 to 15 hours into it.
[368:36.72]Maybe got to about the 40, 50, 60% of the way through the game and then stopped.
[368:41.87]Happens twice now.
[368:43.45]Three times or so.
[368:44.39]That happens more than that.
[368:46.07]I do that a lot.
[368:49.28]But yes, I have played The Last of Us.
[368:51.76]Very good.
[368:57.28]God of War was awesome.
[368:58.44]It was hard to just sit down and play it.
[369:02.16]Not because the game was any bad, but because... I mean, it was... The first hour of God of War for PS4 is... That's one of the best hours of any single game I've ever played.
[369:14.75]There's no question.
[369:17.65]The first hour and 30 minutes of God of War...
[369:22.17]has to be up there in the top five for like best first tutorial plus zones areas ever only the one hour and third no I played for like 15 20 hours I got to like the halfway point or something
[369:40.46]Dr. Clay, thanks for $5.
[369:41.60]You mentioned Perfect Dark.
[369:43.44]I really do miss playing that game.
[369:45.18]The frame rate was terrible, but that game was so ahead of its time.
[369:47.64]I remember playing Combat Simulator all the time with my bro and friends.
[369:53.32]Good times.
[369:55.08]Fist Sim was the worst.
[369:59.52]Always punching and making you dizzy.
[370:01.16]Sorry you got the frog tonight.
[370:09.50]Yeah, I know.
[370:10.82]GoldenEye and PerfectDark.
[370:13.53]I used to play with three other friends on a probably 19-inch CRT TV, and each person had a fourth of a screen.
[370:25.00]Those were the real days, weren't they?
[370:32.92]Those were the days.
[370:37.21]Okay, Grandpa.
[370:38.83]That's fine.
[370:39.65]That's fine.
[370:40.23]Call me Grandpa.
[370:40.97]Call me Mr. Boomer Man, whatever you want to say.
[370:44.73]That was so... That sucked.
[370:47.53]It was horrendous.
[370:48.89]Sharing a fourth of a screen in a game that ran at 12 FPS.
[370:53.05]Barely when we can fucking have our own goddamn screens now and have fidelity of like 4K.
[370:59.11]And have the internet.
[371:00.14]And have a thousand, thousand fiber connection.
[371:02.60]God, the old days were terrible.
[371:04.32]These new days are so much fucking better.
[371:06.08]Holy shit.
[371:07.74]Usability.
[371:08.76]Accessibility.
[371:09.66]My god, how bad was it back in like the fucking early 90s.
[371:17.42]But I still loved it.
[371:18.08]It still was the most fun thing at the time.
[371:21.34]It was amazing.
[371:32.97]I loved all my time.
[371:35.05]And those are some of the times when more games, the pavement of the gaming roads that you drive on today were paved back then.
[371:45.74]Every game system that you think is cool, everything that you like, the road was paved.
[371:52.73]You're driving on that road now, and that road was paved 15, 20 years ago, 30 years ago.
[372:00.35]It's a great road.
[372:02.25]And that road, by the way, has no... There's no potholes.
[372:07.16]Eh, there's a few potholes on that road.
[372:09.42]You can avoid them, though.
[372:10.36]Just, like, slowly, you know, go slow and don't run them over.
[372:15.64]Still a pretty good road.
[372:22.14]That's a fucking fantastic analogy.
[372:24.99]God, you're fucking so good.
[372:30.11]Love you, Jerry.
[372:30.65]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[372:55.29]I'm sorry that everybody around the world, especially in some of the places that have really, really, really heavy lockdowns.
[373:02.79]Because, yeah, around here, the orders are in place, but takeout and delivery is still, without contact, you know, is still available.
[373:16.73]So I can't even imagine locking down even more than that.
[373:20.51]It's probably so fucking hard.
[373:24.57]Stay with it.
[373:25.61]Hang in there.
[373:31.96]I hope the best for you.
[373:33.96]And everybody in New Zealand.
[373:36.70]Hopefully it's over soon.
[373:49.81]Take care of yourself.
[373:51.13]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[373:53.67]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[373:55.05]Stop talking about Hash House Ogogo.
[373:56.77]I'm sick of it.
[374:00.71]But what if you found something that was the best thing you've ever had?
[374:03.44]What if you had to tell people?
[374:08.64]You need people to know of this thing that's the best thing ever.
[374:13.51]People need to be told.
[374:15.61]They need to know.
[374:24.64]No, that's not to do with sponsorships.
[374:26.32]It has to do with the truth.
[374:29.12]The truth.
[374:31.32]No money exchanged.
[374:33.30]No rules or guidelines of what can you say about this or that.
[374:38.16]No, just the truth.

[374:50.36]Best in the world.
[374:51.32]Best in the world.
[374:55.59]You need to spread the word of it.
[374:57.71]I do.
[374:58.23]Because I sat there for the first time.
[375:00.29]And I took one bite.
[375:03.15]And I said.
[375:03.61]Oh my god.
[375:05.53]This is the best food I've ever had in my whole life.
[375:08.30]I have to tell everybody.
[375:11.92]People have to know.
[375:12.66]So when they come here.
[375:13.30]They can do this too.
[375:15.90]Truth.
[375:19.28]When you go to Hash House of Go-Go.
[375:21.00]And you get that blue cheeseburger.
[375:24.56]Tell them.
[375:26.55]And you came there on your own.
[375:28.19]Because they're not gonna give a shit that I said to go there.
[375:38.36]Hey, I want the blue cheeseburger.
[375:40.90]Okay?

[376:10.72]They were not here two or three weeks ago or three years ago.
