[00:01.74]So that's what happened.
[00:11.43]Everyone crashed.
[00:12.61]Yeah, there's only six people on blue right now.
[00:17.58]Wow.
[00:18.04]Well, strong work there by Red Team.
[00:20.28]Yeah, that was good.
[00:23.82]I'm gonna go Huntsman.
[00:24.58]I'm gonna go Huntsman.
[00:30.30]I love, look at the chat.
[00:31.58]I win the duel with Shibs, he DC'd.
[00:37.06]I demand rematch.
[00:46.45]Alright, Demoknight time, son.
[00:49.85]I'm right behind you with the Huntsman.
[00:53.00]Come on.
[00:54.34]There it is.
[00:55.52]Oh, how did I miss that?
[00:57.19]Let's see if I'll cover him.
[00:58.51]Oh, you got him.
[01:00.93]He's covered in that piece.
[01:04.12]I'm right behind him.
[01:04.80]I was going to say I'm right behind him.
[01:05.92]He doesn't even know I'm right there.
[01:07.12]I'm just going to smash him.
[01:12.62]We got this point.
[01:13.56]We're good.
[01:19.81]Oh, God.
[01:22.73]I just turned the corner and shoot somebody in the face and I got blown up.
[01:25.17]I can't do anything right now.
[01:27.86]Ugh, just run away.
[01:28.72]Alright, Demoknight's not happening.
[01:32.08]Let's go Pyro.
[01:33.84]Yeah, this map is pretty big.
[01:35.14]Demoknight would be pretty tricky, I think.
[01:37.65]Let's try this Reserve Shooter Pyro again.
[01:41.49]That's an awesome change.
[01:42.69]I'm happy they did that.
[01:45.19]It's pretty amusing.
[01:49.21]Alright.
[01:52.88]So, for the people that are watching, once again, this is CP Fastlane.
[01:55.90]Man, not one of my favorite maps, but it is fun, I guess.
[02:01.43]It can get interesting.
[02:02.61]Yeah.
[02:05.95]Oh, I got behind everybody.
[02:08.45]Oh, no.
[02:08.77]Yeah, I'm behind everyone, too.
[02:16.66]I'll hold the point.
[02:17.86]Getting on their last.
[02:19.34]Shit, they're already building two sentries in there.
[02:21.52]Come on.
[02:25.88]They got a lot of engineers, that's one thing.
[02:28.12]That guy crits very careful.
[02:31.84]It seems like they want us to just get to the last point and try to cap.
[02:37.41]Yeah.
[02:38.55]I mean... Because usually engineers are not very offensive.
[02:43.59]Oh, I almost got his sandwich.
[02:45.77]Almost got his sandwich.
[02:47.87]Give me a sandwich.
[02:51.73]I could smell the bologna from there.
[02:53.32]I was just trying to grab it.
[02:56.73]Alright.
[03:05.84]Get close.
[03:09.26]I love people that just, like, someone sprays something and they go ahead and, like, read it.
[03:13.04]Just like, yeah, we could use your help, but, you know, feel free to read this spray.
[03:15.96]Yeah, it's more important.
[03:25.02]The door keeps closing on me right when I... Right when I try and shoot in there.
[03:30.70]Oh, my gosh.
[03:32.12]Can I reflect sentry missiles?
[03:34.46]Yes, you can.
[03:35.68]Okay.
[03:36.44]It's very difficult to do, but you can do it.
[03:38.18]Oh, God.
[03:44.73]I still got the P on him.
[03:52.69]Pyro.
[03:55.81]So that was a night.
[03:56.43]Thanks for the smash on the whip.
[03:58.33]I just ran 100 miles per hour right to where I was before.
[04:06.64]Burn, sniper, burn.
[04:11.70]Oh, another crash.
[04:12.64]You crashed too?
[04:13.58]No, I'm here.
[04:14.06]Because I'm looking at people.
[04:15.64]They're standing still.
[04:18.56]What is going on?
[04:22.36]I'm going to burn.
[04:22.86]I'm going to burn.
[04:23.86]You up there?
[04:25.20]I'm dead.
[04:34.76]So Jerma, for the viewers that do not know you very well, tell me about yourself.
[04:40.65]I do mostly Team Fortress 2 commentaries on my own channel.
[04:46.67]Which will be in the video description.
[04:48.53]I've kind of tried to branch off a little bit, especially in the near future.
[04:52.74]I only started this a few months ago, so I'm still fairly new to the whole commentary thing, but not really because I've been growing steadily ever since I started, but I'm still a noob to some regards.
[05:05.67]Yeah.
[05:06.89]Your commentary is very good.
[05:09.23]You're probably my favorite TF2 commentator.
[05:12.25]around.
[05:12.95]I'll say that.
[05:13.77]Well, thanks, man.
[05:14.81]I mean, I've told you this before, but I started this because I used to watch you.
[05:19.05]There we go.
[05:21.72]You were the inspiration, I used to say.
[05:24.22]Yo, what's that song?
[05:25.08]You're like, look at this noob shibby.
[05:27.02]I can do better than him.
[05:28.76]Let's get it started.
[05:31.12]You're the inspiration.
[05:36.36]That's the song I was talking about.
[05:37.82]Oh, this engineer doesn't even know.
[05:39.08]But I'm going to try and branch off sooner or later.
[05:41.06]I plan on doing a lot of Counter-Strike GO content when it comes out.
[05:45.22]Oh, yeah.
[05:46.36]And Diablo 3.
[05:47.51]So Diablo 3, Team Fortress 2, and Counter-Strike GO are going to be my main games.
[05:52.99]At least I'm assuming.
[05:54.51]It depends on how good they are, I guess.
[05:59.88]Yeah, when's Counter-Strike Go supposed to drop?
[06:02.02]I know someone sent me a beta key on YouTube, so... Fairly soon, I think.
[06:08.26]Maybe early 2012?
[06:09.08]Quarter one, I think?
[06:14.54]That's the plan, but, you know, with Valve, you can never know.
[06:17.36]Oh, yeah.
[06:18.32]No question.
[06:25.90]But what about you?
[06:26.48]You've got Battlefield 3 in the works, I'm assuming?
[06:28.48]Yeah, I mean, I like playing my variety.
[06:31.20]Battlefield 3, all the zombie games.
[06:34.10]Obviously Team Fortress.
[06:36.90]Minecraft every now and then.
[06:39.02]That's kind of the plan for the future.
[06:41.38]But yeah, definitely with Battlefield 3 in a week, I'll be doing that.
[06:46.92]And let's see here.
[06:47.64]I plan on picking up Modern Warfare 3 on the 8th of November, and then Skyrim on the 11th.
[06:53.57]Nice.
[06:53.91]So...
[06:55.37]Yeah, I'm not sure how well Skyrim will do on YouTube, such as, I mean, you can't just do a Let's Play for 300 hours, but, like, maybe, like, certain dragon fights or, like, cool quests or any, like, Easter eggs, something like that.
[07:07.10]Yeah, right on.
[07:08.48]Yeah.
[07:08.80]Well, there we go, we just won.
[07:12.30]Yeah, that's my main concern with D3, is pretty slow-paced game, not really a whole lot going on.
[07:19.53]Mm-hmm.
[07:21.03]Definitely something like you were saying, do maybe a couple of cool quests, cool items, that sort of thing.
[07:25.63]Right.
[07:26.31]Because you can't just be like going to the auction house all day and putting that on YouTube.
[07:31.13]That just doesn't work.
[07:32.26]Here's me buying a grandfather's sword.
[07:35.00]Right.
[07:37.01]Now, I never played Diablo or Diablo II, so not really sure what that game's all about, but it doesn't seem like... I mean, everyone I talk to say it's good and, like, it's addicting.
[07:46.86]Alright, we're definitely not playing Turbine.
[07:48.96]I'm going to change the map.
[07:49.86]Alright, we need to play some, like, King of the Hill, something.
[07:55.16]Something a little different here.
[07:57.33]Yo, you got to try Diablo.
[07:59.09]At least Diablo II is one of the best games I've ever played.
[08:02.83]Let's go to the next side.
[08:06.06]Full reels.
[08:07.30]No.
[08:09.58]I played... That's what got me into PC gaming, really.
[08:11.91]Really?
[08:12.15]Yeah, that and the first Counter-Strike.
[08:16.21]Yeah, the original Counter-Strike, that was... That was something else.
[08:20.89]My first PC shooter.
[08:23.47]Yeah.
[08:25.01]Unless you want to count something like Wolfenstein or something, but...
[08:28.94]I think even we're a little too young.
[08:31.04]I mean, yeah, for Wolfenstein, that's, what, like, 86, 89, something like that?
[08:37.08]Yeah, that's... I mean, 86, that's before my time, I'll say that.
[08:42.81]Yeah, I'm an old bastard, so that's... Yeah, how old are you?
[08:45.97]26.
[08:45.99]26.
[08:46.55]So I'll be 23 on Saturday.
[08:49.07]Okay.
[08:52.14]So I have my birthday coming up on the 22nd, yeah.
[08:54.68]What are you doing?
[08:55.96]Are you doing like a birthday bash or something like that?
[08:57.72]I don't know.
[08:58.26]It's just like, it's just kind of crawling up.
[08:59.80]I'm just like, oh, it's going to be my birthday soon.
[09:02.46]I totally forgot.
[09:04.28]Yeah, I did like a live stream birthday party.
[09:06.64]It was pretty fun.
[09:07.86]Yeah, I don't even know if I'll be home.
[09:09.82]So we'll see.
[09:11.56]Who knows where you could be?
[09:13.06]Yeah, maybe I'll do like a 25,000 birthday video or something.
[09:21.41]Oh, hell yeah.
[09:21.81]I don't know.
[09:25.61]Oh, that means everyone's going to get you a birthday present.
[09:29.39]That's not necessary.
[09:33.01]People's fanship and love and all that stuff's enough.
[09:38.74]I'm sure if I would just sit on Team Fortress 2 all day, people would be trading.
[09:43.62]All day.
[09:44.08]I don't know if I could handle that.
[09:46.30]500 free strange weapons or something.
[09:49.50]Yeah.
[09:52.42]Whoa.
