[00:05.45]Hey!
[00:08.51]Jermashito, oh the misery.
[00:10.19]Jermashito forgot to get me my batteries.
[00:12.91]That's what you guys are spamming?
[00:24.68]That's what we're going with today?
[00:26.60]That's what we're doing today?
[00:34.47]Well, okay.
[00:36.23]Hi, how are you?
[00:39.13]Doing alright.
[00:39.77]I'm doing okay.
[00:42.96]Well, you know.
[00:46.48]I've been waiting for this one.
[00:50.92]Yeah, we're playing Wrestling Empire today.
[00:55.45]This game... I'd say probably one of the hardest times I've laughed at a video game in... gotta be at least a couple years, right?
[01:04.46]We played this months back, many, many moons ago.
[01:10.54]Only this time, there's been a significant amount of updates to this game, including outdoor environments.
[01:18.46]Like, you can literally walk around outside and, like, go do things.
[01:23.93]There's a general manager mode where you play the owner guy.
[01:28.35]You play the manager that writes the contracts.
[01:33.64]I mean, we kind of need to see how this plays out.
[01:44.78]Be a manager?
[01:45.32]Oh, yeah.
[01:46.04]That's what we're doing today.
[01:49.18]We're going to see some content that I might have might have missed.
[01:56.09]Yeah.
[01:57.77]I'm ready to go.
[01:58.29]I need to touch grass.
[02:05.64]How much is this game?
[02:07.92]It's not expensive.
[02:08.86]It's very cheap, whatever it is.
[02:10.70]Hold on one sec.
[02:16.67]Yeah, this is not an expensive game.
[02:18.03]It's $15.
[02:20.05]It's worth it.
[02:24.94]I gotta remember how to play.
[02:26.10]I gotta get the controls down again.
[02:28.65]We'll do that on the fly.
[02:30.11]I'll remember it.
[02:30.61]If I have to do the tutorial again, that's fine.
[02:38.19]Omega LOL, he's gonna laugh.
[02:40.63]Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[02:41.35]Let's do it.
[02:43.02]Alright, so... Very important.
[02:50.34]Let me get this mouse off the goddamn screen.
[02:58.56]Alright, so what we're gonna do is I have a very sad thing to tell everybody.
[03:04.13]See, booking career.
[03:06.93]I'm very curious.
[03:08.37]Mr. Satan is gone.
[03:09.31]Because I uninstalled this game.
[03:12.53]And didn't do Steam Cloud on it.
[03:14.27]So this is a fresh playthrough.
[03:20.86]Yeah.
[03:22.38]Fresh playthrough.
[03:24.84]But we'll make it a new person anyways.
[03:25.96]Make it a new character anyways.
[03:28.76]So we're doing booking career.
[03:31.89]I have to pick somebody, but we need to edit somebody.
[03:36.13]What league should I even do?
[03:38.87]What league was it last time?
[03:39.75]It was Hollywood?
[03:43.32]Or was it wrestling school?
[03:44.26]I forget.
[03:44.56]Do Jigsaw Jeremy?
[03:50.41]Where is Jigsaw Jeremy?
[03:57.27]Let's do Hollywood.
[03:59.91]I have to pick somebody to change.
[04:03.21]Eddie Schwarz?
[04:05.19]We can just change Eddie.
[04:11.20]Who should I... How about Beast?
[04:15.14]This is a good one to do.
[04:18.10]Okay, we gotta make this character... Remember, I'm not a wrestler.
[04:22.12]I am the person that books the matches.
[04:28.44]So keep that in mind.
[04:31.63]I can't change popularity?
[04:32.93]I'm not that, I wouldn't be that popular.
[04:34.27]Alright, well, first of all, let's get this right.
[04:40.21]I need a theme song here.
[04:49.80]I'm not gonna make Vince McMahon.
[04:59.26]I want to slow it down.
[05:05.92]I love this one.
[05:08.27]This is the best song.
[05:09.25]I love it.
[05:10.33]Let's do it a little faster.
[05:29.53]How about, oh, the misery?
[05:30.61]Alright, we're gonna take my strength.
[05:32.43]I'm, I wanna, I'm 80, no.
[05:35.12]I'm probably like a 72.
[05:38.98]Skill, though, I can't even change that?
[05:40.48]I can't go higher?
[05:41.70]Why not?
[05:42.02]Oh.
[05:48.23]This is porn music.
[05:50.17]Oh, no!
[05:52.01]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:53.31]I hit B. I know.
[05:55.93]No, no, no, I, this is wrong.
[05:58.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:00.98]I just pressed the B button to go back.
[06:04.85]Just skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.
[06:06.11]I'm gonna retire.
[06:06.73]Fuck.
[06:11.73]Just go with it?
[06:12.41]I'm not gonna just go with it.
[06:13.47]I wanna make a character.
[06:14.42]Retire.
[06:17.48]I'm retired.
[06:17.86]Okay.
[06:21.58]I'm retired.
[06:22.12]Eddie Schwarz, who cares about Eddie Schwarz?
[06:27.04]It doesn't matter.
[06:27.62]I pressed the... Okay, here we go.
[06:29.24]Alright, Hollywood.
[06:29.80]We lost it.
[06:30.22]Alright, Eddie Schwarz is here.
[06:31.94]Whatever, who cares.
[06:33.00]We'll do this one.
[06:46.11]Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[06:47.27]We can edit this and now pick this.
[06:49.47]Name of this character is going to be... I don't know yet.
[06:54.09]I'm not sure.
[06:55.87]Where is it?
[06:56.47]Where's my song?
[07:03.40]Looks like... Did he add tracks?
[07:05.58]I feel like there weren't this many songs earlier.

[08:34.89]Oh, but what about the medieval music?
[08:40.08]Should I put him in like a knight costume?
[08:48.06]Like that's the guy that owns the league?
[09:01.72]Yeah, make it like a king.
[09:02.76]There's too many good options.
[09:16.59]Make it keep it hardcore, but make him a little dweeb.

[09:31.56]Yes.
[09:45.37]I like the ones with lyrics.
[09:51.97]I had this one.

[09:56.78]I remember this.
[10:12.17]It's a Mario level.
[10:28.29]I think keep it hardcore has to stay.
[10:37.17]Make the owner of the league Hora Lu.

[25:38.40]I think I'm okay with casual.
[25:40.16]Alright, that looks good.
[25:40.78]Looks good.
[25:45.71]Alright, moves.

[26:16.96]Oh, that's entrance.
[26:18.02]That's entrance.
[26:19.64]Yeah, he's just like, I'm the puppet master.
[26:32.63]It's not Costanza.
[26:41.85]I'm thinking about something.
[26:43.33]Alright.
[26:43.67]Raise the roof.
[26:46.11]Raise finger.
[26:48.44]Roar.
[26:48.88]Yep.
[26:50.04]Celebration.
[26:58.36]I don't know what he's doing.
[27:03.84]Yeah, constant disappointment.
[27:06.92]Our stance, you guys said?
[27:10.10]Yeah.
[27:11.54]Without a doubt.
[27:12.92]Alright, attacks.
[27:15.04]Upper attack, we got right hook.
[27:22.42]I like the straight jabs.
[27:27.41]Shin kick for sure.
[27:37.47]Do I even fight anybody?
[27:39.49]I'm the manager, aren't I?
[27:40.71]I'm like the general manager of the league.
[27:42.37]I don't think I even do anything.
[27:44.24]That just hurts.
[27:49.26]Fine.
[27:56.91]Super fun.
[27:57.37]Alright, the rest of these are fine, I think.
[28:06.02]That was a magic harp attack?
[28:08.52]This is from the top rope.
[28:12.76]Okay.
[28:13.96]Why is he holding?
[28:14.96]Okay.
[28:16.12]Why is he holding his pants up?
[28:18.48]Did I not give him a belt?
[28:39.24]This guy, he's gonna be fine.
[28:41.64]All of his moves are just falling down.
[28:50.34]This guy's gonna get really hurt.
[28:54.25]Okay, crushes.
[28:58.63]Definitely kick.
[29:01.19]Definitely leg drop.
[29:02.83]Flying crush.
[29:05.53]Yep, just land on his spine.
[29:10.05]Anything that has him land on his back, I'm gonna do.
[29:12.27]Let's see if I can get this guy injured and retire him immediately.
[29:14.71]Okay, good.
[29:21.23]Alright, these are the ones that really, really matter.
[29:25.71]Alright, attack and up.
[29:30.50]These ones are okay.
[29:31.30]I don't need to change these ones.
[29:32.32]It's the specials that I care about the most.
[29:33.88]Alright, what is Dawn Dweeb's special move?
[29:37.44]That's a really good question.
[29:46.34]What should it be?
[29:47.78]How about a stunner?
[29:50.78]I love the stunner.
[29:51.63]It's like my favorite move ever.
[29:59.03]I could watch stunner, Stone Cold stunner compilations, and I wouldn't get sick of it.
[30:05.19]It's like a lot of people's pizza.
[30:07.77]Like, oh, I could eat pizza every day.
[30:09.03]I could watch people get stunned every day.
[30:20.08]Throat toss.
[30:21.50]Tombstone's pretty good.
[30:23.76]Hold on, whatever it is.
[30:24.86]Yep.
[30:26.10]Spinebuster?
[30:27.94]Spear's good too.
[30:28.60]MDKO?
[30:51.37]It can't be that, right?
[30:52.55]What if it was just a hip toss?
[31:06.90]How fucking lame.
[31:08.02]What a dweeb.
[31:09.50]If your special move is a hip toss...
[31:22.04]How about Head Stomp?
[31:28.06]Go Go Plata?
[31:32.88]Ow!
[31:35.94]Nice.
[31:37.98]Diamond Cutter.
[31:38.62]Death Valley Driver.
[31:42.05]Closed Line Drop?
[31:43.91]Canadian Destroyer.
[31:46.33]That's, yeah.
[31:49.21]I don't need to see any more.
[31:54.81]Alright.
[31:56.11]These ones are okay.
[31:58.01]Usually I can keep these ones to normal.
[31:59.46]What about these ones?
[32:00.18]I like the neckbreaker.
[32:04.42]I'm a big fan of, uh... ...filler moves, which are... What the hell was that?
[32:11.58]I like that one.
[32:16.98]He has to have a hip toss.
[32:22.32]Air crash.
[32:27.64]Run and up.
[32:30.34]I like it.
[32:31.06]Headbutt.
[32:33.51]I like it.
[32:37.01]Northern lights.
[32:38.25]Eh.
[32:39.65]Power stunner.
[32:42.39]Oh yeah.
[32:45.01]And fireman suplex.
[32:45.96]That looks good to me.
[32:48.70]Alright, what about rear moves?
[32:54.54]Yep.
[32:57.35]Bull Nelson, absolutely.
[32:59.81]Sleeper hold, absolutely.
[33:03.71]That's such a boomer wrestling move, you know what I mean?
[33:06.48]Oh no, he's got him in the sleeper hold.
[33:10.70]Of course, Don Dweeb would have that move.
[33:16.94]That's good.
[33:20.16]Shoulder lift.
[33:22.78]I never like those moves because they just pin and they're not powerful.
[33:25.60]We're doing reverse DDT.
[33:28.31]I want moves that hurt people.
[33:36.86]I don't need to change that one.
[33:48.90]This is choking.
[33:52.45]All of his moves should just be choking people.
[33:59.49]Recliner?
[34:02.75]Vice grip.
[34:07.93]Okay.
[34:08.45]Yeah, that looks good.
[34:10.09]I'm happy with this.
[34:15.02]Alright.
[34:15.72]Anything else I need to do?
[34:16.98]Relations.
[34:17.54]I don't really... Roll.
[34:20.12]This is Booker.
[34:22.84]And heal.
[34:25.00]That's fine.
[34:25.86]Promotion.
[34:26.30]We'll stay in Hollywood.
[34:28.20]I don't need to have any friends.
[34:31.58]Is this the first time you're playing this?
[34:32.90]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:34.80]Oh, you're not a random chatter.
[34:35.84]That's Mark Skeletor.
[34:36.80]That's Joel.
[34:38.68]I was about to be like, excuse me?
[34:40.12]No, of course I've played it before.
[34:42.02]Random chatter.
[34:42.97]That was Joel.
[34:48.19]I was about to, like, correct you.
[34:49.63]Like, um, excuse me?
[34:50.67]Of course I've played it before.
[34:52.27]What are you, what are you, dumb?
[34:57.75]No, I have played it before.
[34:58.63]This game is fucking amazing.
[35:03.88]It's toxic.
[35:07.22]Hope you've been good.
[35:07.78]Hope you've been good, too.
[35:10.34]We gotta fucking do something.
[35:11.22]Let's do something.
[35:12.94]You wanna hang out, like, soon?
[35:15.61]What are you doing this weekend?
[35:17.91]You wanna play Halo this weekend?
[35:21.45]On insane difficulty?
[35:24.29]And then die in the first 10 seconds a hundred times?
[35:27.96]And not talk to each other for a year and a half straight?
[35:35.29]That's not true.
[35:36.23]That's not true.
[35:39.15]No, let's do something, man.
[35:40.19]It's been too long.
[35:41.65]Let's do something.
[35:44.99]I mean it.
[35:46.97]Alright, Don Dweeb.
[35:47.71]There it is.
[35:48.87]I'm ready.
[35:53.75]Stop with the networking.
[35:57.46]What?
[35:58.56]Joel and I have been buddies for like five years.
[36:03.70]So excuse me.
[36:04.92]I need you to take a quick step back and understand.
[36:07.51]Joel's been around for a long time.
[36:09.81]You serious?
[36:10.35]Here we go.
[36:15.11]Booking career.
[36:16.71]Going to Hollywood.
[36:20.45]It's Don Dweeb.
[36:21.90]I'm ready.
[36:28.38]We're good to go.
[36:33.30]Welcome to Wrestling Revolution, Don Dweeb.
[36:35.32]I understand you'll be taking over as the Booker.
[36:36.98]You got banned?
[36:42.31]Wrestling Revolution is currently in the worst brand of wrestling with a rating of 70%.
[36:46.07]What?
[36:48.83]You've been brought in to turn that around and make Wrestling Revolution a viable brand.
[36:57.64]Is $40,500 available to invest in the talent you need to get the job done?
[37:00.48]Well, we ain't fucking going anywhere.
[37:01.70]That's all the money you're giving me?
[37:04.98]Although I'm stepping down as the booker, I remain the owner and will be checking you don't screw things up.
[37:12.26]But ultimately, we're on the same side and we all want Wrestling Revolution to succeed, right?
[37:19.82]I wish you the best of luck and hope you enjoy running the show as much as I did.
[37:27.57]Okay, so this is the, here it is.
[37:30.33]There's a TV taping.
[37:31.39]It's Scandinavia?
[37:37.24]How much money is this costing?
[37:42.40]Map?
[37:43.78]What?
[37:46.36]We love promos, we hate botches.
[37:48.26]Wait, what is this map?
[37:52.00]We love weapons.
[37:53.80]We hate feuds.
[37:56.09]We love ticket prices.
[37:57.33]We hate, wait, what?
[38:00.45]We, oh God.
[38:03.53]I'm realizing this is a map of the world.
[38:05.97]Okay, alright.
[38:08.05]We love tickets.
[38:09.89]We love, why can't I, the whole world?
[38:11.87]We hate, what the fuck is happening?
[38:18.24]We love cages.
[38:18.96]We hate intruders.
[38:20.12]We hate managers.
[38:21.82]We love time limits.
[38:26.11]We hate near... What does Canada hate?
[38:28.33]Watches?
[38:28.73]They love holds.
[38:32.45]We love furniture.
[38:33.37]We hate countouts.
[38:36.28]We love high flyers.
[38:37.92]We hate... Esa Carrera?
[38:41.66]Is that like a wrestler?
[38:43.82]We love furniture.
[38:49.51]We hate weapons.
[38:50.23]We love high flyers.
[38:53.12]Alright, so where are we going?
[38:54.88]Where are we?
[38:56.35]Where are we?
[38:59.99]Okay, so where's my, where's my card?
[39:02.07]Okay.
[39:04.17]Undercard.
[39:05.87]Alright, I gotta play on this.
[39:08.87]Did you go to Antarctica?
[39:09.89]Alright, the rules, this is fine.
[39:14.79]Where, what is Scandinavia like?
[39:17.12]It's just changing what they like, right?
[39:19.78]Where the fuck is Scandinavia?
[39:23.59]Right here.
[39:25.17]Okay, we love promos.
[39:28.73]Okay.
[39:30.89]So, mid-card, we're gonna have a promo.
[39:34.52]Script.
[39:36.38]Uh, promo.
[39:36.96]Alright, announcement.
[39:40.62]And it's gonna be a, uh, face turn.
[39:47.28]That sounds good to me.
[39:47.88]Cast is fine.
[39:51.99]Oops.
[39:52.51]Well, whatever.
[39:53.08]That's okay.
[39:54.52]That's okay.
[39:54.80]It could just be an announcement.
[39:59.82]Is this all that I have for the midcard?
[40:02.48]Oh, shit.
[40:03.24]Oh, there's no ref!
[40:04.64]I keep deleting people.
[40:06.54]What about the... Alright, what about... What's the under... Why is there only one thing?
[40:12.09]This is every... This is the whole thing?
[40:14.33]The entire event?
[40:17.59]It's just this guy makes an announcement and the event stops?
[40:23.85]It's actually kind of funny.
[40:27.17]Okay, arena.
[40:28.51]Crowds, 1400.
[40:29.79]Lighting, fog.
[40:30.79]Okay.
[40:34.31]Rules.
[40:34.73]Individuals.
[40:37.16]You have to make and then play the matches.
[40:39.96]Oh, okay.
[40:45.06]So this is just the one match that's happening here, right?
[40:50.27]That would be a furniture smash.
[40:56.61]That's fine.
[40:57.97]Elimination.
[40:59.89]No time limit.
[41:02.67]Hardcore.
[41:03.21]Cast is going to be... You're fine.
[41:06.31]That could be whack axe.
[41:10.39]Oh, okay.
[41:11.02]I see how it works.
[41:13.90]You have to actually move this around.
[41:14.94]Let me get rid of you.
[41:19.70]How do I add him?
[41:21.64]What's going on?
[41:24.15]How do I add a wrestler on the other side?
[41:25.37]I can't.
[41:29.33]How do I move this?
[41:29.95]Press Y?
[41:37.73]Okay, so they're in different teams, right?
[41:39.23]Okay.
[41:42.39]And the script is announcement face turn.
[41:43.95]That sounds good.
[41:44.71]It doesn't matter who it is.
[41:47.95]So, is that... Is that it?
[41:50.64]Can I change the other... Is this... This is just it?
[41:54.82]Because the undercard... All these matches are the exact same match.
[41:59.68]How do I add it?
[42:01.12]There's no ref?
[42:05.49]How do I add a ref?
[42:10.49]This menu is kind of freaking me out here.
[42:14.23]Ref.
[42:14.33]No refs, no rules.
[42:14.98]How do I add a referee?
[42:15.96]How do I change this?
[42:40.70]Go to the middle and add.
[42:42.00]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[42:44.78]Haven't you played this?
[42:45.38]Yeah, but I mean, I haven't done much in this menu.
[42:51.34]You have to add someone and give them the ref role.
[42:56.48]Okay.
[42:57.78]So, how about you?
[43:01.34]Script?
[43:02.26]Rules?
[43:06.28]Uh...
[43:09.93]What the fuck?
[43:16.31]I don't think I can do that.
[43:20.12]Okay, well, I just need to do this because you have to add someone with a gray name.
[43:29.42]Wait, I have to play the match too?
[43:30.94]I thought I can't just watch it?
[43:32.06]Oh.
[43:32.48]Alright, Tony Land?
[43:42.82]Uh, what?
[43:43.36]Alright, well, I'm just gonna play the match.
[43:45.34]This is very confusing.
[43:46.60]Who should I play as?
[43:47.82]Ray is retired.
[43:48.92]Drag them to the middle.
[43:50.34]I'm on a controller.
[44:12.49]I'm just going to see what happens when I do this.
[44:28.48]Is this me?
[44:29.06]No.
[44:34.31]Don't Thanos snap the ref next time.
[44:36.01]I mean, it was very easy to accidentally delete somebody.
[44:40.95]Alright, this is me apparently.
[44:42.99]But I thought I was the booker.
[44:44.07]Looks like it.
[44:50.71]Okay, I remember, I remember, I remember.
[44:52.23]Listen up everybody, there's something I need to get off my chest before we go any further.
[45:09.18]I know I've been a jerk in recent times.
[45:11.58]I've said and done some things I'm not proud of.
[45:16.93]But I realize we're nothing without the support of the fans.
[45:19.37]You're the electricity that gives us life.
[45:20.95]This guy's going for the back of the head.
[45:24.77]With your help, I know I can be a better wrestler.
[45:26.41]I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential.
[45:28.47]Are we done with the life-changing crap?
[45:34.67]The only drama that matters is in the ring.
[45:36.91]What's going on?
[45:43.70]Wow, that wasn't very fair.
[45:46.32]There's no ref.
[45:47.74]How are we supposed to do this?
[45:48.80]Alright, let's go.
[45:59.67]You have to fight until the death.
[46:05.05]You deleted the ref.
[46:06.23]Well, I'm sorry.
[46:06.81]If it's so easy to delete a ref, it should be easy to put a ref back in.
[46:18.72]Yeah, there's a new UI, too.
[46:21.66]What?
[46:22.32]Who's Batman over here?
[46:23.40]Alright, I gotta remember how to do this.
[46:27.52]Is this a camera?
[46:35.02]Wait, I don't want to fight anymore.
[46:36.04]Alright, I gotta remember grapple is... Okay, there we go.
[46:45.91]I remember...
[46:56.33]Your ratings are gonna go from 7 to 0.
[47:04.87]How do we end the match?
[47:06.13]I don't understand.
[47:06.89]Does somebody actually have to like... Go to 0?
[47:12.32]Oh my fucking god.
[47:13.48]I'm just gonna kick the shit out of this guy with the chair.
[47:22.18]There are no rules.
[47:35.13]Give me, give me, give me, give me.
[47:43.16]Yeah, honestly, I probably want to just start another career.
[47:46.64]I mean, we're not going to get attached to any of these characters.
[47:54.66]What are you... You're not going on the top rope.
[47:55.93]What are you doing?
[47:56.37]Get the fuck out of here.
[47:58.33]Alright, there we go.
[48:02.05]We're not going to get attached to anybody.
[48:07.72]What do I mean, too late?
[48:09.84]You're not attached to this character yet?
[48:11.40]Fuck.
[48:17.27]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[48:21.15]Read the PDF?
[48:23.13]Oh god.
[48:34.32]Out of the chair.
[48:35.90]So, I forget how you pen.
[48:43.92]Here's the manual.
[48:45.00]Good luck.
[48:46.52]Oh, God.
[48:47.19]Uh... Can I open the manual?
[49:09.18]Why is he pissed?
[49:10.14]I didn't even mean to do that.
[49:13.99]Tony, I'm sorry, Tony Land.
[49:16.11]I didn't mean to do that.
[49:17.59]But I did mean to do this.
[49:18.64]I want nothing to do with this.
[49:39.20]Alright, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[49:40.68]I'm out, I'm out.
[49:41.78]I do, I do want to remember how to play, and I do want to hit Batman in the head with something.
[49:56.20]This dude's supposed to be a face.
[50:00.06]We're fighting for this guy's amusement right now, by the way.
[50:04.49]He's sitting there like, yes, yes, kill each other for my amusement.
[50:12.09]Get out of here.
[50:25.58]Oh, come on.
[50:31.14]He looks like he's wearing an American flag diaper.
[50:33.25]Alright, it's just somebody pin somebody.
[50:47.10]Wasn't this a specific match?
[50:48.50]I forget what this match even was.
[50:50.02]I just hit myself in the head with the chair.
[50:57.38]No cheering.
[50:58.30]Silence.
[50:58.70]Yeah, because this... Nobody likes this league.
[51:01.91]Didn't he say this league sucks or something?
[51:06.99]Oh, I won.
[51:17.10]Alright.
[51:17.48]BabyBall's progress is being hindered by the limitations of Wrestling Revolution.
[51:20.59]Okay.
[51:23.09]Big Bob Orson's profile suffered after losing that match.
[51:25.77]Okay.
[51:30.45]This is Don Dweeb.
[51:31.31]I'm not sure things are working out for me at Wrestling Revolution.
[51:37.98]I know I still have 38 weeks left on my contract, but how would you feel if we terminated our agreement?
[51:49.07]Now, see out your contract!
[51:53.87]Sorry, I knew it was too much ass.
[51:55.17]Let's see if we can turn things around.
[51:56.55]38 weeks.
[51:58.81]Alright, Hardcore Furniture Mash.
[52:06.91]A.B.
[52:07.17]Bull vs. Big Bob Orson, just happened.
[52:10.05]So this now is a mid card.
[52:13.31]I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.
[52:14.39]Don't delete the referee under any circumstance.
[52:19.45]Last laugh?
[52:20.95]Oh.
[52:22.97]Last man standing street fight.
[52:26.92]Please look at the guide.
[52:28.80]Remove the referee.
[52:29.62]Read the manual.
[52:30.82]Let me just take a quick look at it.
[52:34.12]Free roam is only in wrestler career.
[52:35.87]This mode may be too complicated for you to start with.
[52:39.85]Oh.
[52:42.23]Shit.
[52:43.21]Okay.
[52:47.66]Shit.
[52:49.18]Okay, alright.
[52:53.97]Okay.
[52:55.09]Okay.
[52:58.69]Okay.
[53:04.11]Where's Don Dweeb?
[53:17.48]Time for Don Dweeb's wrestling career.
[53:25.60]You tanked the company by not reading the manual.
[53:34.06]Let's see what we can do with Don Dweeb.
[53:35.80]Alright, I'm in Wrestling Revolution.
[53:39.96]This is singles match versus Midwinter at 8pm.
[53:43.52]A gimmick.
[53:45.24]Okay, database.
[53:45.94]Let's go.
[53:46.28]Proceed.
[53:46.98]Rome.
[53:54.32]See, you've decided to take responsibility for what happens behind the scenes, Don Dweeb.
[53:58.43]You didn't read the goddamn manual.
[54:00.91]You lost your job in 15 minutes.
[54:02.75]If you take this route, it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time for your match.
[54:10.05]But only enter when your time is lit up green, as Amber means somebody else's match is taking place.
[54:16.81]What?
[54:18.24]Spend your energy on the right things at the right time to stay healthy.
[54:25.15]This world is full of distractions, but try to make sure you get a good night's sleep at a sensible time.
[54:32.83]You must also look after your mental health along the way, as I've seen a lot of wrestlers lose control.
[54:36.56]I got five grand.
[54:38.52]I don't want to spoil all the surprises, so just get out there and see what the city has in store for you.
[54:47.67]This is what I wanted to do.
[54:49.93]You can always opt out and skip straight to the action at any time.
[54:56.97]Who is he talking to?
[55:00.31]Jerk Hoffman?
[55:02.21]Why is Jerk Hoffman of no health?
[55:04.37]Why is there a grenade?
[55:05.25]Why is there a fucking dino?
[55:06.71]Why is he so mad?
[55:07.67]What's wrong with this guy?
[55:09.57]Wait, I'm waiting for my match?
[55:25.51]Okay, so where do I go?
[55:26.87]What should I do?
[55:32.63]I'm on the street?
[55:33.89]Wait, don't I have a match soon?
[55:38.02]Why is everybody just walking around the street?
[55:42.26]This is the whole roster.
[55:44.28]Don't let anybody scare you out of taking this route.
[55:46.56]There are risks, but it can also be more fulfilling.
[55:48.60]Is he talking to me?
[55:49.28]I gotta get this on camera.
[55:52.53]Just try to stay out of trouble to protect yourself.
[55:54.01]And if you can't do that, I still have your back.
[55:57.00]Alright.
[56:01.86]Why does everybody have a microphone out here?
[56:13.18]What?
[56:14.00]What is this?
[56:16.20]What is this show starting?
[56:17.80]Everybody, we got to get in there and be on camera.
[56:20.64]Get out of my way.
[56:22.28]I'm tougher than you, Don Dweeb.
[56:32.73]Why would they put us all outside?
[56:35.07]I don't understand.
[56:37.89]Get him off me.
[56:49.73]Somebody get him off me, please.
[56:52.62]Get out of the way.
[56:53.28]Get him off of me.
[56:54.28]He's still on me.
[56:55.61]He's breaking my ankle.
[57:00.37]Somebody help.
[57:02.29]Help.
[57:03.13]Please.
[57:08.60]I got to get in there.
[57:09.18]My match is starting.
[57:12.06]Backstage.
[57:12.68]Alright.
[57:12.88]Where's the arena?
[57:15.00]My health is zero.
[57:17.70]I'm coming.
[57:18.02]I'm coming.
[57:18.32]I'm coming.
[57:18.61]I'm coming.
[57:21.38]God damn it.
[57:22.28]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[57:23.08]I'm here.
[57:23.30]It's mine.
[57:30.78]Here I am.
[57:31.16]What am I fighting?
[57:33.98]What's happening?
[57:36.30]Drop it?
[57:37.06]What do I have?
[57:51.63]What team am I on?
[57:52.69]I didn't pay attention to whose team I was on.
[57:55.11]Am I a manager?
[57:58.72]What's going on?
[58:13.56]Why are these people here?
[58:15.94]They just got us outside.
[58:17.02]We're just like fucking like rats in the city.
[58:21.39]Why is there somebody at a desk?
[58:25.15]There are just a bunch of random people here.
[58:27.94]Why is there just some lady at a desk here?
[58:30.32]She's not commentating.
[58:31.26]Oh my god, get off of me.
[58:39.08]Please don't tap out.
[58:40.14]Alright, I'm good.
[58:47.73]Alright.
[58:48.89]Who am I?
[58:49.33]I don't...
[58:54.73]I have no health.
[58:55.87]Why did we just have a brawl outside for no reason?
[58:59.55]It said, here comes the show, the show is starting, and everybody freaked the fuck out.
[59:07.66]What's going on?
[59:11.44]What?
[59:16.52]I'm crawling.
[59:21.76]How is this not illegal?
[59:24.98]This apparently isn't illegal.
[59:29.80]Why are there two people in the ring at the same time with me?
[59:32.38]This is unfair!
[59:38.94]Okay, can I please like get one second?
[59:43.51]Okay, let's go.
[59:52.67]Oh my fucking god, please!
[60:00.53]You gotta be ready for your match.
[60:01.95]That's so funny.
[60:02.73]What happens if you have no health though?
[60:07.77]I can't move.
[60:08.59]My character's just stunned.
[60:13.18]I gotta get out of here.
[60:19.30]What?
[60:21.00]Will everybody leave me alone for a second?
[60:23.67]Everyone's just out to get me!
[60:26.35]Did I really fuck up that bad as the booker?
[60:28.59]Does everybody just hate my guts?
[60:35.51]You have no idea how bad we are.
[60:43.19]There's no reason for that.
[60:45.82]Yeah, there was.
[60:46.62]What are you doing here?
[60:47.50]I don't even know.
[60:52.48]Can I see the match details?
[60:57.94]I'm fighting mid-winter.
[60:59.78]That's what's going on.
[61:02.30]I have no idea who the fuck these other people are.
[61:15.83]He's not...
[61:16.84]WHAT?!
[61:21.90]Alright, now I understand what's going on.
[61:35.09]I can at least pretend like I know what I'm doing.
[61:40.29]Oh, that's great.
[61:40.93]You leave here with your group of seven fucking wrestlers.
[61:45.03]that were all out here at the same time, together, on the same team.
[61:48.25]And I'm just some dweeb that was here alone, apparently.
[61:54.82]Why did you get that many people?
[61:59.80]Am I supposed to leave the ring?
[62:01.50]I can't even get up.
[62:04.00]What's he doing?
[62:04.64]I can't move.
[62:15.25]It's- what's- my dust- I gotta get out of the ring!
[62:22.16]Oh shit, it's not my match anymore.
[62:23.38]Alright, I gotta go.
[62:31.64]Ugh.
[62:41.07]Come on, hurry up.
[62:42.35]How do I get health back?
[62:45.83]John Dweeb's profile suffered after losing that match.
[62:48.14]What about people with 10 versus 1?
[62:51.06]Give me a break.
[62:54.84]Oh, a special has generated a buzz by interfering in that match.
[62:59.38]He had the shit my pants walk.
[63:02.66]I mean, you get beat up by eight people.
[63:16.70]Did I even make any money?
[63:20.88]I lost $450.
[63:21.46]Hold on a minute.
[63:25.22]You're trying to tell me that a ladder that was backstage that I picked up on the ground cost me $200 to bring it out to the ring.
[63:38.44]I don't want this anymore.
[63:39.26]Alright, I gotta heal.
[63:41.94]Can I see the map somehow?
[63:42.72]Alright, office.
[63:45.58]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[63:49.93]I'm glad Midwinter could teach you a lesson.
[63:51.87]You don't belong at Wrestling Revolution, Don Dweeb.
[64:10.17]Wait, what?
[64:12.29]I have to pay $700 in damages?! !
[64:18.61]I just went out there and got my ass kicked for 15 minutes.
[64:21.41]I didn't do any- What are you talking about?
[64:25.65]What?
[64:25.97]Oh my god.
[64:36.14]What the hell?
[64:38.28]This is so fucked up.
[64:46.07]Alright, I need to go to the bathroom.
[64:48.67]Please don't hurt me.
[64:50.51]Please don't hurt me.
[64:51.15]Please don't hurt me.
[64:52.79]Please don't hurt me.
[64:53.65]Don't hurt me.
[64:54.13]Don't hurt me.
[64:54.61]Don't hurt me.
[64:55.11]You're walking at me with a bottle.
[64:56.22]Please don't hurt me.
[64:58.02]Please don't hurt me.
[65:04.76]That guy was almost late to his match.
[65:05.86]Did you see that?
[65:06.32]Okay.
[65:14.26]Let that be the end of it, dweeb.
[65:15.66]I hope you've learned your lesson.
[65:23.57]Where am I going?
[65:25.83]I'm not controlling the character right now.
[65:31.37]I'm not controlling the... You're in no state to... If you can't save your energy for the ring, then I'll just have to keep you out of it.
[65:45.58]What do I do?
[65:46.59]Alright, I have to... Looks like you lost control for a while there.
[65:49.11]You need to look after your mental... What do you think?
[65:51.51]Honestly, I haven't had one second myself.
[65:54.71]My popularity is dwindling.
[65:56.21]Please get... What?
[65:57.27]How am I supposed to do anything when everybody just attacks me?
[66:00.85]What the fuck do you want me to do?
[66:06.54]Oh, I wonder.
[66:07.32]I wonder.
[66:08.60]Please.
[66:16.91]That's the promoter.
[66:18.09]That's the promoter.
[66:22.13]That's my boss.
[66:24.92]Oh, my fucking chest.
[66:27.62]I just need to get to another door.
[66:29.54]I can't run.
[66:31.32]I need to go to like the bathroom.
[66:34.68]Please.
[66:35.14]People are throwing weights at me.
[66:37.13]Everyone's trying to kill me.
[66:40.36]Oh my god.
[66:41.10]I popped when you used that ladder piece as a weapon.
[66:44.86]Remind me to never get on your bad side.
[66:47.86]Can we be friends?
[66:48.72]Can we be friends?
[66:51.64]Can you help?
[66:53.96]Honestly.
[66:54.90]Can the three of us work together or something?
[66:57.00]Can we be friends?
[66:59.42]Yes.
[66:59.98]Oh my god.
[67:00.46]Please help me.
[67:02.66]Thank god.
[67:03.12]Alright.
[67:04.44]I don't know.
[67:11.78]How do I close the door?
[67:26.53]Oh my fucking god, I'm the only idiot that can like trip and fall in a herd of- What the fuck is going on?
[67:33.39]Whose phone is that?
[67:35.73]Whose phone is ringing?
[67:36.87]Is that my phone?
[67:40.34]Is there a telephone ringing in the bathroom?
[67:45.74]How do I answer the phone?
[67:55.55]I don't...
[68:09.49]Okay.
[68:09.87]That was a good first day.
[68:14.70]Okay.
[68:17.56]Boomtown's agility's improved.
[68:20.90]People's salaries risen.
[68:23.90]After seven hours of uncomfortable sleep, Don Dweeb's energy levels are now at 30%.

[69:31.67]I need food, barbershop, studio, hotel, office, cemetery, airport, hospital.
[69:39.55]Alright, where's the hospital?
[69:40.25]It's connected to the gym.
[69:43.74]Nobody wins their first match at Wrestling Revolution, Don Dweeb.
[69:46.44]Try not to worry about it.
[69:47.26]Thanks.
[69:51.70]Is that your buddy right there?

[70:01.32]How do I eat it?
[70:07.68]I said to eat the random food that's on the ground.
[70:17.04]And you know, do I have any of these scraps in here for me?
[70:19.05]Is this corn on the cob?
[70:21.94]Please leave me alone.
[70:25.68]What a weirdo.
[70:26.36]Alright, go go go, hospital.
[70:49.72]Okay, this... You never should have taken this step, Dawn Dweeb.
[70:54.00]You don't have what it takes to survive in the real world.
[70:58.84]If you want to be escorted to the ring safely, just admit you made a mistake and back out.
[71:06.13]Um, why are you ha- I don't want this.
[71:09.09]I need to- where's the hospital?
[71:10.77]Wait, there's a hamburger on the ground.
[71:11.75]Alright, if you really want to do this, then... This is the doctor!
[71:15.39]He's not treating me!
[71:17.09]How do I get treated by the doctor?
[71:24.46]out of the bed.
[71:26.04]You alright?
[71:26.44]Phone!
[71:32.41]Hello?
[71:35.17]I was hoping to speak to Machine Muri.
[71:58.77]Let me just eat all the trash off his crown.
[72:04.53]Stop!
[72:05.35]Please!
[72:05.87]Okay, well I guess I can't get treated.
[72:09.21]From the doctor who's trying- You know what?
[72:10.69]I'm fucking sick of this guy.
[72:14.12]I'm sick and tired of your shit, you understand?
[72:20.22]Where do you keep the medicine?!
[72:25.74]What?! !
[72:30.42]This guy attacked me when I came in here.
[72:33.74]You attacked me.
[72:34.93]That's what happened.
[72:40.55]I mean, I found it on the ground.
[72:43.91]Yeah.
[72:46.92]I'll sell you my guitar.
[72:51.48]It was a pleasure doing business with you.
[72:52.72]Thank you.
[72:53.08]I wonder what you're going to use it for.
[73:04.61]He's washing his hands.
[73:05.91]Can I lay in the bed?
[73:11.09]Why is the bed on fire?
[73:21.14]Oh, that's how you do it.
[73:22.08]Okay.
[73:26.50]You have to go lie in the bed.
[73:30.06]Can I buy that guitar off of you so I can club the doctor in the back of the head?
[73:43.06]We got more popular somehow.
[73:47.38]I love how that's news.
[73:50.74]Don Dweeb got 8 hours of comfortable sleep today.
[73:54.34]Alright.
[74:00.20]This is awesome.
[74:01.58]This is so fucking funny.
[74:03.02]I love this.
[74:03.72]Okay.
[74:09.92]Super Lucha Libre have sunk below Wrestling Revolution.
[74:12.54]They're the least popular brand.
[74:14.34]Alright, I got a Singles vs. Boston Bluefly at 6pm.
[74:26.71]Okay.
[74:27.31]I'm not going to... I'm going to eat something off the ground.
[74:34.13]Listen, DonDude, I've been keeping an eye on your progress.
[74:35.93]I think some changes need to be made.
[74:40.43]Huh?
[74:41.79]Fans pay to see people they care about, but you're not popular enough to move the needle.
[74:45.31]I had one day.
[74:49.48]Increase your popularity to 58% by the fourth week of May, or I can't promise there'll be a place for you.
[74:55.10]Oh, shit.
[74:55.80]I need to win my next match.
[74:56.66]I just threw an orange at him.
[75:09.77]You have two hours till your match?
[75:12.55]Alright, I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[75:14.88]I gotta bring this.
[75:15.38]No, no, no, I don't wanna be on the street.
[75:22.42]Can I go to the gym and try to level up or something?
[75:29.98]How do I train?
[75:30.54]There's gotta be like a training bag or something, right?
[75:43.84]Can I lift?
[75:44.58]Can I just pick stuff up off the ground?
[75:45.76]Does this count?
[75:51.89]Ooh!
[75:52.37]Okay, that does work.
[75:53.73]Oh my god.
[76:07.61]Any more food on the ground?
[76:13.27]Lift weights and there are steroids.
[76:16.90]I imagine that punching bag is important too.
[76:18.94]Okay, I need to go to the... Where's the arena?
[76:28.42]How do I get to the arena?
[76:28.98]Okay, the arena is... I gotta go from the gym backstage.
[76:39.99]Which is over here?
[76:44.61]Alright, it's not time for my match yet.
[76:46.97]I am in good spirits.
[76:48.10]I'm in good standing That guy has a bomb That guy has a bomb.
[76:53.16]I'm not gonna stand even remotely over there Alright, it's my turn on time.
[77:04.22]It's a singles match right ow ow
[77:10.25]It's my time to go out on stage.
[77:11.81]You're not going to follow me out on stage.
[77:14.73]Please.
[77:18.06]Keep it hardcore.
[77:20.46]Keep it hardcore.
[77:22.92]Keep it hardcore.
[77:24.42]Come on, do it.
[77:25.65]Come on, do it.
[77:27.75]Keep it hardcore.
[77:49.43]Let's go.
[77:57.14]Seems things have been spiraling out of control here at Wrestling Revolution.
[78:01.59]You telling me?
[78:04.75]Well, not tonight because I've been called in especially to restore order.
[78:12.88]If you step out of line in my ring, I'll kick both of your asses as if I'm in the damn match.
[78:20.84]Let's go.
[78:21.58]I have to win this.
[78:25.56]Shut up.
[78:27.12]Yeah, clap this.
[78:33.56]Stop taunting.
[78:34.32]This is embarrassing for me when you do that.
[78:41.79]Get out of here.
[78:45.24]How do you pin?
[78:46.64]I forgot how to pin in the game.
[78:51.74]Or shit reversal, if you ask me.
[78:56.36]It's the taunt button?
[78:57.00]Okay.
[79:06.83]Hip toss?
[79:07.39]Alright, let's go.
[79:12.58]I'm s- I'm not strong enough to lift a guy- Oh my god, he just broke my neck.
[79:24.87]Knock him down.
[79:25.95]Get out of here.
[79:26.95]Oh shit!
[79:32.39]That hurt me more than it- Wow.
[79:36.05]Um... Is that legal?
[79:46.69]Alright, I gotta pick you up.
[79:48.99]How do you miss that?
[79:49.83]I don't understand how you miss that.
[79:54.66]Fuck outta here, good.
[80:01.58]Come on, get him down!
[80:05.07]No!
[80:16.46]What the fuck was that?
[80:20.36]Get up!
[80:23.08]He's got the camera.
[80:29.75]Okay, I'll take it.
[80:36.21]Camera, please come over here.
[80:38.25]If I could have seen, that would have been great.
[80:44.21]Hello?
[80:53.24]Good.
[80:57.59]No, you know what?
[80:58.47]Let me see if I can get it.
[81:01.09]No, I want to climb the turnbuckle.
[81:02.35]He just threw the guitar at him.
[81:04.43]Can I climb the turnbuckle here?
[81:09.78]Shit.
[81:10.34]That's stupid of me.
[81:21.19]I'm not doing terribly, though, even though I'm way weaker than this guy.
[81:31.89]What do I do?
[81:34.87]He's okay with the ladder being here, which is weird.
[81:37.01]I don't know.
[81:41.03]Get it.
[81:44.73]Reverse, reverse, reverse, please.
[81:47.39]This is fucking so stupid.
[81:56.40]Get up.
[81:58.96]We're both at the same health.
[82:09.51]Ah.
[82:10.09]What an idiot.
[82:10.85]Fell for it.
[82:11.27]This guy's harder than Malenia.
[82:18.76]What do you mean grab the gun?
[82:21.20]What gun?
[82:25.17]Is this thing over here?
[82:26.39]This is not a gun.
[82:28.07]I don't know if this is... I think that's illegal.
[82:32.82]I don't think I can use that.
[82:33.62]Alright, come on.
[82:45.42]This dude reverses every single submission.
[82:58.17]Dude, this blocking!
[82:59.23]This guy is... Really?
[83:01.05]Come on!
[83:12.21]What the fuck?!
[83:14.21]Um, how do I... Stop reversing everything!
[83:29.04]The gun on the... Are you trying to tell me if I shoot... I'm not going to shoot this guy.
[83:44.27]I have to get my popularity up.
[83:46.25]It means I have to win a match.
[83:49.45]Not get disqualified.
[83:50.59]Let's go for Finn.
[83:55.39]One.
[83:56.57]Two.
[84:01.04]Shoot.
[84:01.30]I'm not gonna shoot him.
[84:02.24]Not right now.
[84:02.76]My hand.
[84:10.11]Fuck.
[84:16.57]God damn it.
[84:17.77]How do you reverse?
[84:29.96]Get over there.
[84:30.90]Choke him!
[84:38.07]Hit him!
[84:38.37]That's it!
[84:46.20]I have more health than he does.
[84:50.42]Jesus.
[85:02.53]Go!
[85:04.18]Oh, please.
[85:10.50]Get over here.
[85:14.57]I don't know who's doing this to who.
[85:16.77]Am I choking him or is he... I don't know what's happening.
[85:21.03]I can't tell who's doing this.
[85:26.20]He has me?
[85:26.94]No.
[85:27.26]No.
[85:34.37]Oh, he's going to break my head off.
[85:42.89]Get up.
[85:50.41]I need the gun.
[85:50.93]It's the only way.
[85:52.13]It's not the only way.
[85:55.89]Here we go.
[85:56.33]I got it.
[85:59.14]He hit his head on the ladder.
[86:00.66]He hit his head on the ladder.
[86:01.94]We're good.
[86:02.82]We're good.
[86:03.14]He hit his head on the ladder.
[86:04.38]He hit his head on the ladder.
[86:07.73]We're good.
[86:08.47]The gun!
[86:09.05]I'm not going to... Oh my god.
[86:10.25]Stop with the gun.
[86:10.99]It's a rope break if I've ever seen one.
[86:19.95]Yep.
[86:26.15]I don't know.
[86:26.81]What are you... Are you serious?
[86:35.26]This is so close.
[86:36.48]It's too close.
[86:37.34]I am actually having trouble getting up.
[86:55.82]God damn it!
[86:59.94]Choke him.
[87:02.90]What's going on?
[87:10.21]Oh my god, why?
[87:11.70]Ben, that's gotta be it.
[87:27.03]One minute in the match.
[87:28.45]One minute.
[87:37.63]Oh my god, there's a hot dog out here.
[87:38.93]I can't.
[87:39.71]I don't want to do it.
[87:40.41]I can't.
[87:41.95]I can't.
[87:43.41]No.
[87:51.56]This is like Mortal Kombat rules.
[87:53.19]If I have more health than he does.
[88:06.20]I got him.
[88:07.89]I got him.
[88:09.21]What's happening to my arm?
[88:11.31]Who wins?
[88:24.90]No, put this down.
[88:26.12]Put this down.
[88:26.66]Put this down.
[88:27.10]Put this down.
[88:28.30]Put this down.
[88:28.72]I'm not going to use this.
[88:29.46]I don't know how to put it down.
[88:33.97]How do you put it down without shooting it?
[88:35.09]How do I put it down without shooting it?
[88:37.01]I need to put it down.
[88:37.67]Okay, I'm good.
[88:39.49]Oh my fucking god.
[88:58.89]I know.
[88:59.27]I can't shoot him.
[89:00.23]I'm getting out.
[89:06.11]Good.
[89:06.81]Okay, what about my popularity?
[89:09.29]Von Dweebs is... Thank God.
[89:12.71]I'm no longer facing... It was 58, right?
[89:16.07]I made it.
[89:30.29]I made some money there probably too, right?
[89:31.77]1100?
[89:32.41]There we go.
[89:35.09]There it is.
[89:35.95]Alright, I'm back over 5k.
[89:36.85]What if I go out there right now?
[89:38.77]No.
[89:57.98]I need to go to sleep, and I need to train.
[89:59.34]Actually, you know, let me... Let me go do an activity while I still have some time.
[90:09.27]That was your first victory at Wrestling Revolution, Don Dweeb.
[90:15.59]Let's hope it wasn't the last.
[90:18.00]Okay.
[90:20.48]Are we buds?
[90:24.70]Can I, like, shake hands or something?
[90:28.25]Alright, what about the bar?
[90:29.10]Pizza.
[90:40.37]Alright, the show's over.
[90:42.31]I imagine people are gonna be coming to the bar.
[90:56.58]Was this your hamburger?
[90:57.62]I don't know.
[91:01.89]Remember, you're on a mission to increase by popularity to 58%.
[91:06.19]I got it.
[91:09.57]You only have until the fourth week of May.
[91:10.93]You better make sure you're on top of it.
[91:12.39]I'm already there, man.
[91:18.28]Can I order a drink?
[91:18.80]Okay, I'd like a drink, please.
[91:30.20]I'm not trying to do this, I promise.
[91:31.76]I just want to sit in the stool.
[91:43.07]I'm losing health.
[91:45.77]What happened?
[91:46.59]Oh my god!
[91:47.41]What?
[91:47.73]Oh my god!
[91:49.57]Holy shit, who is this guy?
[91:51.46]Who is this guy?
[91:52.16]Okay.
[92:07.56]I can't.
[92:11.00]That wasn't me.
[92:12.44]That wasn't me.
[92:13.04]But I... This guy is... We gotta... I don't know.
[92:16.44]I'm so confused.
[92:19.31]What was the point of that?
[92:20.29]This guy's just a dick.
[92:30.02]Okay.
[92:30.36]I gotta get my revenge.
[92:40.54]Get out of the way.
[92:42.04]Oh my god.
[92:46.44]Are they all here together?
[92:54.67]Where are you?
[92:55.45]There you are.
[92:56.73]What's your name?
[92:59.87]I don't know.
[93:00.39]Is it this point right here?
[93:01.23]This guy right here.
[93:03.95]Oh my god.
[93:04.92]He's unstoppable.
[93:06.10]Oh my god.
[93:06.62]What?
[93:06.82]What?
[93:19.95]Oh, shit.
[93:24.53]Somebody has to... We have to take that guy out.
[93:28.14]I hit that guy in the back of the head with a chair and he just turned and looked at me.
[93:38.87]You're faster than me, dweeb?
[93:40.07]What?
[93:42.69]Oh my god.
[93:43.35]Get up, get up, get up, get up.
[93:49.61]What are you... I love that there's AI just randomly, but this guy over here just sitting watching.
[93:59.60]You look like a mess.
[94:00.48]Why don't you take a shower?
[94:04.35]Oh, I have to clean myself.
[94:20.78]Get me out of here.
[94:24.96]The guy left anyways.
[94:32.45]Oh boy.
[94:33.07]I thought he left.
[94:37.03]Okay.
[94:44.38]I'm going to go to the hotel.
[94:53.95]Hotel's right here.
[94:58.67]No, you idiot.
[95:00.59]Oh my god.
[95:01.33]The hotel is right there.
[95:07.97]I need to form a team.
[95:10.70]I can't do my next match.
[95:12.16]I really don't think so.
[95:25.02]I lost popularity.
[95:26.02]I still have enough.
[95:31.87]Pables and table legs match.
[95:35.09]Versus Verlaine.
[95:38.75]Okay, this is at 10pm.
[95:42.70]I need to heal or something.
[95:47.30]What time is it?
[95:49.92]What time is it right now?
[95:55.35]I need to go to the hospital and lie down for an hour.
[95:59.41]Oh my god.
[95:59.99]I have two hours?
[96:01.03]Are you kidding me?
[96:04.28]You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever.
[96:06.18]Okay.
[96:07.76]Please accept a $100 bonus as a reward.
[96:13.20]Just make sure you keep up the good work.
[96:15.10]Thanks.
[96:17.06]Thanks for the $100.
[96:17.48]I don't think I have enough time.
[96:28.80]I don't know what to do.
[96:30.40]My match is in an hour and a half.
[96:32.32]I just need to eat food on the ground.
[96:33.70]Is there a cafeteria?
[96:37.73]Hospital.
[96:38.39]It's probably... The hospital is the only thing I can do, right?
[96:40.79]Just lie in the bed for an hour.
[96:51.24]Go to the subway?
[96:52.08]That's not a, like, subway eat fresh subway.
[96:55.24]That is a drive on a rail subway.
[96:58.73]This is alright.
[97:07.53]I have one hour.
[97:28.32]Come on, just food and drink on the ground.
[97:37.78]30 minutes.
[97:38.04]20 minutes.
[97:51.75]Alright, I gotta go.
[98:12.76]Where do I go?
[98:13.22]I forget how to get there.
[98:16.92]It's backstage.
[98:17.93]Over here.
[98:21.49]I'm going to puke?
[98:22.09]What's wrong with me?
[98:25.19]I'm holding my mouth.
[98:26.03]What's going on?
[98:36.44]Hurry up.
[98:36.74]Come on, come on, come on.
[98:48.79]Uh, I really needed that sleep apparently
[99:12.48]Really needed that sleep.
[99:14.09]That guy's double fisting mics.
[99:21.53]So what happens if I just stay asleep here?
[99:23.47]What happens here?
[99:28.90]He hits a referee in the head with a bat.
[99:32.26]Why?
[99:40.70]What happens?
[99:41.88]Oh no, I think they're getting annoyed.
[99:48.57]The entrance won't stop.
[99:54.41]Oh, here we go.
[99:56.87]Okay, I'm up.
[99:59.19]Come on, do it.
[100:01.31]Come on, do it.
[100:04.01]Keep it hardcore.
[100:06.55]Keep it hardcore.
[100:12.07]Why do they have beds everywhere?
[100:22.17]All week we've been polling fans on which match they would like to see and they voted for... John Dweeb versus Berlin in a beds and barbed bats match.
[100:35.50]They sure did.
[100:37.00]Which conveniently enough is the exact situation we prepared for.
[100:44.73]In case you've never seen a match like this before, let's make sure that we're clear about the rules.
[100:47.85]Is this, like, first person to, like, go to sleep?
[100:49.83]Do we have to, like, go to, like, oh, I'm going to go to bed first.
[100:54.69]Pin or submission falls count anywhere, and there are no disqualifications.
[101:00.53]Those rules suit me perfectly, so it seems these fans want to see you suffer.
[101:08.14]Well, they just felt they had to do something this drastic to make one of your matches entertaining.
[101:15.96]Okay, well that was nice.
[101:17.62]Thank you.
[101:21.32]You wanna keep it hardcore?
[101:22.24]Fine.
[101:25.96]My god.
[101:31.51]Look, I'm- Alright, I'll take it.
[101:32.89]I just almost killed him.
[101:34.05]Look at his health.
[101:42.82]Stop!
[101:43.40]Fuck.
[101:43.70]Okay, I'm alright.
[101:47.33]Is there a painting?
[101:50.45]It's a painting of the ultimate warrior.
[101:55.14]He's dual welding.
[102:08.81]I just have to pin him, right?
[102:21.09]Good.
[102:21.49]Alright, this is good.
[102:22.07]Give me that bat.
[102:34.12]That person's not supposed to be in here.
[102:41.28]Get out of here.
[102:51.39]Are they booing me?
[102:53.41]I'm just doing what I have to do.
[102:54.59]They're attacking me.
[102:58.71]Outlaw Eaton is here.
[103:02.09]Is Outlaw Eaton here to fight me or is Outlaw... Oh, good.
[103:06.46]Perfect.
[103:08.04]That works for me.
[103:09.60]Me and Outlaw Eaton are going to be friends.
[103:17.64]I just have to pin him.
[103:20.14]What do the beds have to do with any of this, by the way?
[103:22.30]That's the stupidest thing.
[103:25.13]Alright, I'm gonna do like a suplex to him on the bed.
[103:26.97]Nice double team.
[103:32.59]I gotta end it flashy.
[103:40.92]Come here.
[103:42.04]No, get... Let's go.
[103:50.45]That did not work at all.
[103:52.37]Don't ask me why that didn't work.
[103:53.53]I have no idea.
[103:56.69]You know what?
[103:57.42]Just pin him.
[103:58.46]Right?
[103:58.98]Like, honestly.
[104:11.88]Keep it hardcore.
[104:13.13]Give me that mic.
[104:23.64]It's not gonna work.
[104:25.36]Welcome to bed.
[104:34.35]Pin.
[104:34.67]Pin.
[104:34.91]Pin.
[104:35.11]Now.
[104:35.29]That's it.
[104:35.85]There's no way you get up from that.
[104:36.73]You gotta be kidding me.
[104:44.10]Dude.
[104:45.12]Um.
[104:46.36]No.
[104:48.40]Excuse me.
[104:49.46]Please.
[104:51.42]Zero health.
[104:52.22]How is this still happening?
[105:02.19]Oh my god, this guy's impossible.
[105:08.89]Alright, this is it.
[105:12.65]We need to get on the bed, and then I need to... I need to finish... I need to... How do I say this?
[105:22.70]You need to... I need to...
[105:26.91]the table.
[105:27.43]I need to power bomb you through the table.
[105:33.35]God damn it.
[105:34.07]I'm done.
[105:35.15]Get over here.
[105:38.33]Just start.
[105:47.03]This is happening to me again.
[105:48.41]Help me.
[105:50.45]Help.
[105:57.64]Why is this guy unkillable?
[106:00.22]That has to be it.
[106:17.37]Up here.
[106:19.29]Climb up here.
[106:19.79]I want to do like a pile driver to you.
[106:27.88]Come on.
[106:30.92]What are you so afraid of?
[106:31.72]Nice.
[106:39.94]Shit.
[106:43.88]Okay.
[106:45.78]Why can't I... I'm sick of this.
[106:48.78]I'm going to bash his head in with this grate until he can't move.
[106:56.00]You make me go against, like, the hardcore champion guy, right?
[106:58.97]Alright, this is it.
[107:07.11]Done.
[107:08.39]Of course.
[107:16.44]Crush his head.
[107:23.41]No.
[107:26.74]This guy seriously wants to come in so bad.
[107:28.74]Oh, he's fucking bent.
[107:40.73]Yeah.
[107:42.15]Dude.
[107:45.23]The guy back there watching.
[107:51.87]Let go, let go, let go, let go.
[107:53.09]We're friends.
[107:56.22]Beat him.
[107:58.73]You need to find the gun.
[107:59.77]Dude, maybe I should find the gun.
[108:13.07]Seriously?
[108:13.57]I can't keep this guy not- That's it.
[108:24.32]Yes!
[108:27.47]You cost me that match, outlaw.
[108:28.87]If you mess with my career, I'll end yours.
[108:32.73]Let go of my hand.
[108:37.72]Yeah, we keep it hardcore.
[108:54.80]Keep it hardcore!
[108:56.80]Come on, do it!
[108:59.52]Come on, do it!
[109:01.94]Keep it hardcore!
[109:03.80]Keep it hardcore!
[109:05.18]Is my neck okay?
[109:08.66]Keep it hardcore!
[109:10.16]Keep it hardcore!
[109:14.07]Keep it hardcore!
[109:16.47]Come on, do it!
[109:19.11]Come on, do it!
[109:24.35]Okay.
[109:34.36]Popularity way up.
[109:35.82]Attitude way up.
[109:37.32]I lost agility though.
[109:44.56]Outlaw Eden has generated a buzz by interfering in that match.
[109:46.96]That means I gotta find Outlaw Eden.
[109:49.50]I actually have to sleep on a bed this time.
[109:52.54]Yeah, please.
[109:56.62]Big money?
[110:01.30]Yep.
[110:04.18]Ooh.
[110:04.42]We're running short of staff tonight, Dweeb.
[110:07.72]Can I count on you to referee one of the matches?
[110:12.06]Yeah.
[110:14.32]Am I gonna get paid?
[110:14.94]Thanks, Dweeb.
[110:18.85]You just saved the show.
[110:19.71]Please accept an extra $350 for your time.
[110:21.93]Nice.
[110:25.41]Oh, it's right now.
[110:37.21]Alright, wait, is this a false count?
[110:38.45]No, okay, this is just regular match.
[110:43.40]I'm gonna spend this time to just heal.
[110:45.64]I'm not, I don't care about anything else.
[110:47.40]I'm gonna go find, like, I'm gonna go in the audience and find, like, hamburgers and stuff.
[110:50.64]I'll be back.
[110:51.00]Anybody have any food?
[111:11.36]Do we have any extra popcorn or anything?
[111:18.24]It has to be somebody.
[111:19.04]Somebody has to have food, right?
[111:19.94]There's no stray food?
[111:26.74]Whatever.
[111:27.02]What about your job?
[111:30.45]My job?
[111:30.77]I'm doing it.
[111:31.09]It's fine.
[111:34.63]Can I like grab onto the ring and maybe get like a snack or something?
[111:38.59]That guy just tapped out.
[111:41.87]Whatever.
[111:42.17]I need to heal.
[111:51.44]Who do I want to win?
[111:52.18]Okay.
[112:02.92]Self-insert character.
[112:04.34]Yeah.
[112:04.78]It really is.
[112:05.84]I gotta get this out of here.
[112:06.95]This is not allowed.
[112:13.36]Oh, count!
[112:24.33]Should I count to 10?
[112:29.17]Should I count them out?
[112:33.45]You lose.
[112:34.43]I don't know why you were refereeing this match, Don Dweeb.
[112:38.65]You're obviously not qualified.
[112:40.06]I just gave you an extra 5 to 10 full seconds.
[112:43.24]You just made the biggest mistake of your life.
[112:45.04]Nice fucking Dark Souls roll.
[112:48.82]Excuse me.
[112:56.43]God fucking damn it.
[113:05.76]Get up.
[113:08.32]He's getting back in the ring.
[113:14.44]That's right, he won.
[113:16.52]Congratulations.
[113:25.17]Alright, that was easy 350 bucks.
[113:32.69]I've established Don Dweeb as a face.
[113:36.16]I don't know how that happened.
[113:45.21]Okay, I need... So glad we won that match, Dawn.
[113:47.77]It was a pleasure working with you.
[113:48.81]I agree.
[113:54.47]So, I wonder if we can do a tag team or something together.
[113:57.98]Um... Everybody's just sleeping on the ground.
[114:07.95]This is weird.
[114:25.80]It's a gas leak.
[114:30.73]Another win just makes you another target dweeb.
[114:33.01]Now it will mean even more when I beat you.
[114:52.93]Oh, you're not gonna have very much health tomorrow, are you?
[115:05.58]Oh no, I'm making enemies!
[115:07.60]Alright dude, you proved your point.
[115:09.34]I don't want any more trouble with you.
[115:11.50]Yeah.
[115:15.20]You went right to bed.
[115:23.68]I gotta get out of here.
[115:24.84]Oh, you know what?
[115:25.36]I'm tired too.
[115:27.39]I'm a little sleepy.
[115:31.41]Oh, I can't sleep on the street here?
[115:33.95]Why not?
[115:42.46]Hotel, hotel.
[115:43.10]Yep.
[115:49.04]Where's the hotel?
[115:54.57]Cemetery?
[115:55.99]No, I want to go to the hotel.
[116:04.13]What?
[116:04.51]Are there people in these caskets?
[116:09.87]No, I don't know about this.
[116:11.05]I was right in front of it.
[116:20.75]Where is it?
[116:21.29]Podcast experience.
[116:25.77]Share your s- where, where?
[116:29.65]Where?
[116:32.53]The right?
[116:35.90]Hurry.
[116:37.34]Hotel.
[116:53.01]Oh shit, hey.
[116:55.27]I know you.
[116:57.02]What's up?
[116:58.78]Oh, cool.
[116:59.54]You want to, like, room together?
[117:04.60]Alright.
[117:05.10]Yeah.
[117:06.13]Can I have one of your water?
[117:07.61]Well, alright.
[117:08.87]I guess I'm going to sleep on the bed, I guess.
[117:15.32]Appreciate you letting me have the bed.
[117:26.05]Hot bunk sleepover, yeah.
[117:30.81]After four hours of comfortable sleep, that was it.
[117:38.04]I want to get a championship.
[117:41.38]Lucha Libre is really not doing well.
[117:43.92]Alright, there's a three-way match at 7 p.m.
[117:49.38]That sounds good.
[117:50.04]I'm going to stay in the bed for a little while.
[117:52.34]I think it's for the best.
[118:03.39]Can I go in the bed again?
[118:04.15]Or no?
[118:04.93]Can I wash my hands?
[118:06.53]Okay.
[118:14.36]So, how do we work together?
[118:15.34]Oh, we're like... We're a good friend.
[118:18.80]I like this guy.
[118:19.84]Alright.
[118:21.28]So... How do we...
[118:32.68]Does this do anything for me?
[118:37.64]I think we're just talking.
[118:38.42]We're just hanging out.
[118:43.26]This is healing me.
[118:44.62]Look at my health.
[118:50.96]What?
[118:53.34]I just wanted to wish you luck in your match tonight, Don Dweeb.
[118:57.12]Who is this?
[119:01.11]After all, dangerous things happen back here, and it would be a shame if you ended up crawling to the ring.
[119:08.92]But neither of us want that to happen.
[119:10.74]Hand over $870 and I'll let you live.
[119:12.66]Okay, yeah.
[119:16.94]Bring it, you piece of shit.
[119:19.86]I'll be ready.
[119:20.30]You're not even worth my time, dweeb.
[119:23.03]I'll get you when you least expect it.
[119:25.61]Sure you will.
[119:31.18]believe that guy uh it's not him right this is not this is this person that's not the person I was just on the phone with I don't know eaten eaten I think this is the guy eaten this is the guy I think eaten this is the guy this is the guy that I was just he was literally talking through the door
[120:05.10]You're more popular than me.
[120:05.98]I don't want any trouble.
[120:10.85]Oh my god, the match.
[120:15.43]Listen, Don Dweeb, a lot has changed since we first signed you to $900 a week.
[120:18.79]Yeah, I got something going on here in a second.
[120:22.52]Yeah?
[120:23.32]We have to make sacrifices to stay afloat.
[120:24.68]How would you feel about a pay cut?
[120:27.08]Pay cut, huh?
[120:28.88]Yeah, yeah.
[120:29.66]Just a quick pay cut.
[120:31.68]You pay me what we agreed.
[120:35.45]Oh, you're gonna cut me off?
[120:38.05]What?
[120:39.91]What do you mean, cut me off?
[120:46.84]Congratulations on beating Berlin yet again.
[120:48.70]That raised your profile to 64%.
[120:50.10]Somebody's getting choked over here.
[120:58.22]Yeah, thanks.
[120:58.86]I appreciate it.
[120:59.54]Alright, I have a match, apparently, I guess?
[121:02.67]Am I still signed with this company?
[121:10.68]I'm sure there are places you'd rather be, Dom, but I'm glad to have you here.
[121:13.50]Thanks.
[121:17.14]I got... I gotta do my... I gotta do my routine.
[121:21.43]I'm so fucking stressed.
[121:22.47]God damn it!
[121:24.07]One, two, three.
[121:28.35]Keep it hardcore!
[121:30.89]Keep it hardcore!
[121:33.21]Keep it hardcore!
[121:35.03]Come on, do it!
[121:35.95]Come on, do it!
[121:38.19]Keep it hardcore!
[121:39.13]Keep it hardcore!
[121:41.80]There's nobody here.
[121:49.88]This shit's empty.
[121:53.94]This is where your story starts, Don Dweeb.
[121:56.14]You don't think I'll be s- What?
[122:01.71]You'll have to learn the ropes here each week before a major promotion even considers offering you a contract.
[122:05.87]Why am I talking to myself?
[122:09.55]For some people it never happens, while others wish it never had because they end up back here broken.
[122:17.06]Be careful what you sign up for because there'll be a lot of promoters trying to take advantage of you.
[122:24.91]But if you look after yourself and make smart choices, it's perfectly possible to have a fulfilling career.
[122:32.45]Anyway, let's see what you got before we see how far you'll go.
[122:41.12]Huh?
[122:42.95]Who are these people?
[122:46.85]I thought this was a fatal three-way.
[122:49.73]Why are there five people in the ring?
[122:52.35]I'm back at wrestling school.
[122:56.33]Oh, God.
[123:01.92]Really?
[123:02.24]I got fired.
[123:05.54]That's, that's, that's horse shit.
[123:09.06]What are you talking about?
[123:14.48]I didn't take the pay cut.
[123:16.86]What the fuck?
[123:18.38]I have to fight these idiots?
[123:25.09]He's not even a referee.
[123:29.13]I'll get signed, don't worry.
[123:30.77]Look, I'll take this opportunity.
[123:32.33]I'm going to sleep through every match and I'm going to level up my strength and shit.
[123:39.47]What do I care?
[123:40.11]I'm not signed to any promotion.
[123:41.11]I'm just going to go like...
[123:44.57]Lift weights.
[123:45.41]Drink at the bar.
[123:47.43]Make friends.
[123:48.23]Yeah.
[123:49.93]The redemption arc is coming here soon.
[123:53.08]Yeah, training arc.
[123:56.36]Don't ask me how the hell this plays out.
[123:57.90]Honestly, just disqualify me.
[123:58.94]I don't even want to be here.
[124:14.40]That's not even a referee.
[124:21.29]Yeah, what am I... Why am I even here?
[124:23.47]No, fuck this up.
[124:34.56]I want... I want this.
[124:40.56]I'm taking company property.
[124:49.59]He does not want me to leave.
[124:52.18]Come on, no, leave me alone.
[124:55.58]He's like, whatever.
[124:57.62]What?
[124:59.82]Oh, shit.
[125:03.08]Oh, good thing for Rupert Royale.
[125:05.80]I spent $100 taking a chair.
[125:07.70]Alright, somebody sign me to a deal.
[125:21.48]I'm so sorry to see you lose to Flitters McGinn.
[125:26.00]That knocked your profile down to 61%.
[125:27.58]Yeah, that's too bad.
[125:32.91]Alright, training arc time.
[125:37.33]I'm gonna go sleep.
[125:41.37]At the hotel.
[125:41.83]I don't know what this is, but I'm taking it.
[125:49.23]Losing your first match was a bad start, Don Dweeb.
[125:50.95]It's all downhill for you at wrestling school.
[125:53.47]Yeah?
[125:55.63]I don't think so.
[125:56.41]I think it's only up from here.
[125:58.12]Because I'm downgraded to the bottom tier.
[126:01.70]It's only up.
[126:04.06]By the way, fuck you.
[126:07.16]Oh my god, that pissed a lot of people off.
[126:18.38]I was one of you.
[126:19.16]I was one of you guys.
[126:23.16]We used to be tag team partners.
[126:24.50]No, I never had one.
[126:27.97]Alright, let's do it.
[126:29.69]Sleep.
[126:41.30]Very good.
[126:46.54]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[126:49.00]$160,000.
[126:49.02]Whatever.
[126:49.28]At this point, I'm paying the newspaper to run these articles.
[126:53.68]They're not doing this on their own.
[126:55.44]Hey, run an article about how I got 10 hours of sleep last night.
[127:15.86]I have a Singles versus Sebastian slobber.
[127:18.10]I can win this.
[127:20.32]I need to heal though.
[127:23.02]What's the studio?
[127:23.90]I'm curious.
[127:31.71]There's a studio.
[127:32.61]What's the studio?
[127:36.65]It's a bar.
[127:40.69]Studio?
[127:49.62]How do I get to the studio?
[127:58.31]Oh.
[128:00.13]Sounds like a podcast.
[128:06.71]Alright, what's going on in here?
[128:07.69]Oh my god, there's money on the ground.
[128:13.14]Holy shit, that was $440 on the ground.
[128:19.38]Can I be on your podcast?
[128:20.95]Wait, let me try.
[128:27.17]Okay.
[128:27.33]So, what are we gonna talk about?
[128:29.24]I can't interview everyone who sits there.
[128:35.01]Go and do something worth talking about.
[128:56.96]Okay, alright.
[128:58.50]And I got it on camera too.
[129:00.37]Here, you can take the tape.
[129:04.69]Okay, take the tape and I'm ready for the interview.
[129:11.05]So, what happened there?
[129:13.01]Well, I decided I was going to attack you.
[129:14.92]And just so I could film it.
[129:15.94]And then that was something you could upload and talk about.
[129:19.34]I mean, did you see what happened?
[129:20.20]I got knocked down.
[129:20.80]I got knocked down to wrestling school.
[129:23.54]Which, can you actually believe that?
[129:26.61]I don't know.
[129:26.89]It's unbelievable.
[129:30.22]Oh, I have a match.
[129:34.39]Nice talking to you.
[129:57.46]On my way to the bar?
[129:59.64]Oh!
[130:00.40]I'm sorry, I can't go.
[130:03.44]Alright, I'll leave you here at the backstage area.
[130:05.14]You know where to find me if you change your mind.
[130:06.85]I wish I could go with you, but I gotta match right now.
[130:09.49]Oh my god, my attitude is so bad.
[130:11.31]Fuck yeah!
[130:19.64]No more lip syncing.
[130:21.08]This dude came out and ate a fucking banana.
[130:25.66]Can you believe it?
[130:36.23]Anybody who couldn't beat Splitters McGuigan doesn't belong in the ring with me.
[130:40.73]Splitters McGuigan is nothing compared to me, and that makes you less than nothing.
[130:59.68]Let me see.
[131:00.48]Let me see if I can just smash his head in.
[131:04.08]Nope.
[131:06.44]Alright, fine.
[131:06.84]You wanna do that?
[131:07.40]I'm in so much trouble.
[131:25.90]Why did you trust fall outside the ring?
[131:28.20]Because...
[131:30.27]I don't know.
[131:30.63]Alright, let's wrestle.
[131:34.84]Get it?
[131:43.69]There we go.
[131:46.05]It might be too heavy.
[131:47.73]Good move.
[131:52.49]How can you seriously get up faster than me?
[132:06.84]This guy's way stronger than me, too.
[132:09.34]Unfortunately.
[132:09.90]Get him!
[132:23.39]Yeah, his stats are like five times better than mine.
[132:34.55]You were just on the referee's podcast, was I?
[132:37.27]Really?
[132:37.55]Is that the same guy?
[132:39.53]How did you get here before I did?
[132:40.53]He's too heavy.
[132:51.62]I'm gonna lose this match.
[133:00.72]It's possible, but...
[133:03.97]I need to taunt more.
[133:07.77]The only way you can do a special move is if that bar in the bottom of the health bar goes up all the way.
[133:11.98]Let's see if I can get it.
[133:18.58]You should use the gun.
[133:23.32]I'm not going to use the gun yet.
[133:28.94]That's only in an extreme circumstance.
[133:36.93]Nice.
[133:37.83]Ooh, that was a really smooth transition.
[133:48.18]Wild driver, come on.
[133:49.20]Yes.
[134:00.09]What happened there?
[134:08.76]Make it quick.
[134:12.80]Is it a possible comeback?
[134:13.60]I think so.
[134:14.00]If I can get that filled up, it will be.
[134:15.08]Shit.
[134:21.05]God damn it.
[134:22.03]Bad.
[134:23.53]Bad.
[134:23.89]Oh, come on.
[134:36.68]No!
[134:38.05]His arms are long.
[134:38.89]Why did I make him five feet tall?
[134:40.99]My reach is so bad.
[134:42.23]This is a great opportunity to do this.
[134:56.18]Taunt.
[134:58.14]He ain't getting up.
[135:07.06]Three.
[135:11.34]What just happened?
[135:13.10]He's gonna get disqualified.
[135:15.44]Do it already.
[135:15.90]Swing it.
[135:16.56]Swing it then.
[135:17.20]Hit me with it.
[135:17.74]Hit me in the face.
[135:24.23]Get yourself disqualified.
[135:25.21]See what I care.
[135:25.65]I got plenty of time.
[135:27.63]Almost there.
[135:48.98]Nice.
[135:49.34]Alright, this should be it.
[135:50.92]Here it comes.
[135:53.30]Here it comes.
[135:53.92]I'm gonna be able to do my- What was my finishing move?
[135:57.52]I forget.
[135:57.82]I don't remember.
[136:01.10]Go for it.
[136:05.97]Oops.
[136:06.75]Do it again, quick.
[136:14.31]Ow!
[136:19.76]That took a lot of health off.
[136:26.52]Get up!
[136:33.86]How did I do the Canadian Destroyer?
[136:36.74]And this guy is now kicking the shit out of me.
[136:46.49]I don't know what happened there.
[136:47.91]I have absolutely no idea.
[136:51.81]I wish I could tell you what happened.
[137:05.32]Good.
[137:06.14]Okay.
[137:06.40]Come on.
[137:09.22]Can I get a submission?
[137:20.44]Let me close.
[137:21.12]He's not near the ropes.
[137:30.19]Oh my goodness.
[137:30.95]He's going to fucking submit me, isn't he?
[137:32.31]No.
[137:36.65]No.
[137:49.10]You get tired?
[137:49.79]What was that all about?
[137:50.49]What's going on?
[138:04.70]Come on!
[138:10.38]The ref is doing what I would be doing.
[138:12.70]He's just like going up on the top ropes, getting down, rolling around on the ground.
[138:16.21]I would be just having, I would be jumping around.
[138:28.04]I do a move and then I get hurt.
[138:29.60]This is stupid.
[138:36.08]That works for me.
[138:36.70]How come this is not filling faster?
[138:52.07]What the fuck?
[138:53.31]Ow!
[138:54.07]What?! !
[138:57.10]Why?
[138:57.62]Oh my god, what's happening?
[139:03.80]Dude, this is illegal.
[139:05.74]That's illegal.
[139:10.49]Oh my god.
[139:13.29]Look over here, he's sitting in the chair.
[139:15.11]I didn't do anything.
[139:16.79]I can't move.
[139:19.87]Oh my god.
[139:24.69]Please, this can't end like this.
[139:27.95]Oh my god, please!
[139:29.91]Get off of me!
[139:33.95]Why was he allowed to do that shit, but not me?
[139:35.92]That's so un-fucking-fair.
[139:37.10]I'm at 8, 8, 8, 8, 8.
[139:38.20]I'm fine.
[139:38.46]Oh, it worked!
[139:56.93]Count him out.
[139:57.41]Count him out.
[139:57.71]I'll do it again.
[140:04.63]Good.
[140:05.49]Keep him down.
[140:07.91]No, you piece of shit.
[140:12.59]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[140:22.12]Dude, I grabbed you.
[140:23.76]Why are you able to reverse it every time?
[140:35.31]Dude, this is... Dude.
[140:38.23]I keep saying, dude.
[140:42.43]This match obviously is getting out of control.
[140:44.27]Allow me to restore order.
[140:47.73]Dude, there's 10 seconds left.
[140:58.06]Pin up, pin up, quick!
[141:00.08]No!
[141:00.48]No!
[141:04.70]I just received word from backstage this match must be restarted immediately.
[141:08.76]Huh?
[141:19.40]What are you doing to us?
[141:25.22]Dude, that's so stupid.
[141:27.48]I don't even know who this guy Sifu is fighting.
[141:30.93]I think it's me.
[141:55.88]At some point, don't you just call this match?
[142:00.76]You know what I'm saying?
[142:02.02]Like, at what point is this over?
[142:03.62]It's been over for a long time.
[142:10.61]One of us is gonna get injured.
[142:19.28]That's it.
[142:19.72]Pin him.
[142:21.48]Rope break is stupid.
[142:22.86]Alright.
[142:26.42]Maybe I can make him submit.
[142:27.30]That's right.
[142:37.87]There's no gun?
[142:38.77]No, there is no gun.
[142:44.37]Please, just say...
[142:49.67]Dude, I do a move to this motherfucker.
[142:51.49]He just reverses it immediately.
[142:55.55]Immediately, every time.
[142:57.21]I know, my stats are awful.
[143:08.66]I don't... Get off of me.
[143:34.89]I don't even know if I can play anymore.
[143:36.63]I think I just have to die.
[143:37.96]Okay, fine.
[143:46.30]Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
[143:50.74]I lose.
[143:52.46]That's un-fucking-believable.
[143:54.14]This guy's so bad.
[143:55.42]I made him like a manager.
[143:58.65]I made this guy a manager.
[144:01.21]And I gave him like 40% strength.
[144:18.98]Get over here.
[144:21.41]I can't even attack him.
[144:27.25]Don't let him get away with this.
[144:36.15]At least it wasn't affected.
[144:44.01]Listen, Don Dweeb, I've got a match coming up that I'm not sure I can win on my own.
[144:48.51]Mm-hmm.
[144:50.53]Okay.
[144:50.69]Would you consider assisting me at ringside for 350 bucks?
[144:55.13]Absolutely.
[144:57.19]It made you pay for the banana.
[144:58.29]I need to start making friends.
[145:02.01]I can't just... Everybody hate me.
[145:08.87]What is money used for?
[145:09.89]Um...
[145:23.53]I don't know.
[145:28.51]This is a... We're doing this in the gym.
[145:36.43]What else is over here?
[145:37.59]That's my water.
[145:39.55]Give me that water.
[145:47.65]Wait, she...
[145:58.45]Who's on my team?
[146:04.61]Who's on my team?
[146:05.32]Has the match started?
[146:13.32]Okay, you got it.
[146:18.52]You got this.
[146:20.02]Go for it.
[146:20.40]Okay, orange.
[146:22.60]Orange.
[146:29.47]Good reversal.
[146:30.93]Let me know if you need me.
[146:32.53]I'll be ready.
[146:49.09]I missed.
[146:49.47]Oops.
[146:52.15]God damn it.
[147:03.15]How does that miss?
[147:03.91]I don't... I can't get in the ring.
[147:18.67]How did you... I don't know how I missed.
[147:21.12]Should've hit.
[147:33.28]Oh my goodness, you go so far.
[147:35.65]Okay, I got it.
[147:39.32]I'll take the hit.
[147:39.90]I'll take the hit for you.
[147:58.37]Get up, get up, get up, get up.
[147:59.31]No, no, no, I don't.
[148:00.23]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[148:03.19]I don't want to do that.
[148:04.85]I don't want to get me out.
[148:06.01]How do I get out of the ring?
[148:06.75]Get out of the ring.
[148:09.39]Okay.
[148:10.05]It's a pin.
[148:11.05]I think it's a pin.
[148:12.83]I think.
[148:19.96]I couldn't have done it without you.
[148:26.80]Jesus, I just wanted to just run and throw something.
[148:30.28]Can I stay in the gym?
[148:34.00]Good fight.
[148:51.60]What more do you want from me?
[148:52.94]Excuse me.
[149:03.92]Oh, suffered.
[149:06.46]Okay.
[149:07.58]Good.
[149:08.48]Okay.
[149:08.72]I don't have a match today, right?
[149:21.51]I don't think I have a match.
[149:27.12]I don't have anything I can do, actually.
[149:30.10]Read the posters in the gym.
[149:31.81]I need to sleep.
[149:33.41]I'm not going to go to my next match.
[149:34.63]I'm just not going.
[149:43.50]I need to level up somehow.
[149:44.88]I am not going.
[150:00.12]Okay.
[150:02.03]Nine hours of sleep.
[150:02.87]That's good.
[150:06.41]The industry will come together to stage a special event on the fourth week of June where all proceeds are expected to be donated to charity.
[150:12.72]Okay.
[150:13.82]Okay, I have a shoot fight at 7 o'clock.
[150:16.34]I think I'm just going to skip it.
[150:17.18]You know what I mean?
[150:22.57]Should I skip it?
[150:36.81]I have to level up.
[150:37.73]I can't just... You know what I mean?
[150:39.45]I need to level up.
[150:40.33]I'm not going to do that by just losing a match and then going to sleep, waking up, losing a match, and going to sleep.
[150:48.24]That's not going to happen.
[150:58.16]Okay.
[150:59.02]So I'm punching bags?
[151:00.26]What do you think?
[151:13.29]Run the track to improve your stamina.
[151:16.39]Oh shit.
[151:17.99]Really?
[151:36.24]Get off.
[151:40.98]You're not going to be working out then get out of the equipment.
[151:43.66]Seriously.
[151:44.02]I need water.
[151:55.11]Okay, that was some stamina.
[152:01.29]Is there any water lying around?
[152:05.31]Sleep recharges you.
[152:06.33]Uh, lift weights for strength.
[152:15.38]Drink out of the toilet.
[152:16.94]What's going on right now?
[152:29.03]You can try to interact with any scenery by taunting nearby.
[152:31.57]Okay.
[152:32.97]Okay.
[152:36.72]Alright, my stamina is at 61%.
[152:43.33]I'm not going.
[152:44.79]Should I?
[152:45.07]I don't have any health.
[152:51.15]How is there one bottle of water in this whole fucking gym?
[152:55.09]There's nothing even in there.
[152:55.92]How did it splash?
[152:56.54]Yo, wait.
[153:00.70]I need to go.
[153:03.20]Is there any water on the ground?
[153:08.35]I have no stamina.
[153:16.45]This is the one for charity?
[153:17.69]I don't think it is.
[153:18.34]There's actually people here in this one though.
[153:33.89]What were the rules in this one?
[153:34.69]I didn't notice.
[153:36.21]Scorebends, I know you're cowering backstage, clinging to that undergraduate title of yours.
[153:40.83]That may be the safest place for you right now, but that treasure can't stay buried forever.
[153:51.54]I want you to pay attention to what happens in this match, because you're next.
[154:01.72]Fuck.
[154:03.82]This is bad.
[154:05.68]This is bad.
[154:07.56]This is really bad.
[154:13.90]I'm in a lot of trouble here.
[154:15.78]Yeah, I need to cheese this fight.
[154:17.02]Yeah, I do.
[154:19.93]I have an idea.
[154:20.35]You should really hurt your back.
[154:36.31]Go get the gun.
[154:38.68]This is not a hardcore match.
[154:39.88]There's no gun.
[154:40.46]I promise.
[154:43.06]There's a sledgehammer over there.
[154:45.68]Your character is 50.
[154:50.90]I completely forgot about that.
[154:52.36]Oh my goodness.
[155:01.01]He's 55.
[155:06.97]I'm gonna lose immediately here.
[155:12.19]You designed the worst fighter possible.
[155:17.39]Shit.
[155:23.74]Go change the character in the editor?
[155:25.24]I guess I could do that and just put his stats to like kind of normal.
[155:38.73]How much longer am I going to be in this mission for?
[155:40.77]Alright, whatever.
[155:47.46]I'm retiring this guy.
[155:51.80]Don Dweeb is being retired.
[155:53.50]I'm literally retiring Don Dweeb.
[156:09.13]No, I don't want to get up.
[156:20.51]Oh my god, stop doing that move.
[156:29.10]He's despised.
[156:43.50]Alright.
[156:44.30]Okay.
[156:44.76]Don't weave.
[156:46.32]I've had enough.
[156:49.82]Oh.
[156:50.26]My.
[156:50.94]God.
[156:51.52]Yeah.
[157:08.29]Most hated man in wrestling school.
[157:13.46]Gone dweeb.
[157:15.46]Shittiest character ever.
[157:22.71]I'm just going.
[157:27.01]I'm just going to the subway.
[157:28.39]I'm going to the airport.
[157:29.13]I'm leaving.
[157:31.28]Where's the airport?
[157:33.36]I'm just getting on a plane.
[157:34.08]I'm leaving.
[157:39.20]Barbershop.
[157:42.89]Okay, it's across from the gym.
[157:44.79]This way?
[157:48.56]Leaving town.
[157:49.24]Yeah, it's time to leave town.
[157:56.14]I didn't want to go to the cemetery.
[158:01.89]What's over here?
[158:07.61]Okay, let's go.
[158:15.06]Where am I going?
[158:20.51]How much is a plane ticket?
[158:27.81]Am I going to a different state?
[158:30.53]Where am I going?
[158:31.19]Country?
[158:31.61]Sorry, I'm going to be that guy.
[158:37.54]I'm going to pick the only empty seat that's next to you.
[158:41.54]And eat a bunch of food.
[159:01.87]Is there a bathroom?
[159:09.90]The plane was moving.
[159:10.84]I just bought another plane ticket.
[159:15.39]What?
[159:15.87]No, I was- I thought it was a bathroom.
[159:34.66]How long do you stay on the plane for?
[159:36.38]This is so ridiculous.
[159:47.83]I want to sit next to you.
[159:48.69]Can I get healed?
[159:49.47]Yeah.
[159:54.43]It's been a rough six months here.
[159:57.77]Something you want to say to me, Don Dweeb?
[160:02.42]I mean, kind of.
[160:05.31]I have a proposal for you.
[160:10.19]Well, you have my attention now.
[160:11.55]What do you want to talk about?
[160:15.87]Well, I'd like to work with you.
[160:22.49]How do you see us working together?
[160:27.19]Would you be my partner?
[160:31.14]We don't even work for the same company.
[160:32.56]I don't see that happening anytime soon.
[161:05.40]Can you believe this guy?
[161:06.46]Am I sleeping?
[161:14.19]Who's asleep?
[161:22.11]Why do you never have health?
[161:23.35]Because this guy... This... This guy... What?
[161:28.49]What happened?
[161:29.93]What happened?
[161:30.84]What happened?
[161:31.52]What happened?
[161:31.92]What happened?
[161:32.30]What happened?
[161:32.66]What happened?
[161:33.00]I...
[161:40.24]I threw- I threw like a fucking cell phone at him.
[161:44.24]What?
[161:47.32]What the fuck was that?
[161:48.36]What happened?
[161:48.94]God dammit.
[161:53.16]Don Dweep has been booked to face Score Benz in a singles match on the third week of June.
[162:10.16]You're a menace.
[162:10.86]I honestly didn't mean to do that.
[162:13.40]I just threw something.
[162:33.26]No.
[162:34.18]No, no, no, no, no.

[163:00.50]I'm starting over.
[163:01.00]I'm starting over.
[163:01.46]Just leave.
[163:01.84]Just leave everything.
[163:02.98]Get out.
[163:05.14]He's retired.
[163:14.58]Why is it slow?
[163:25.61]Longest careers.
[163:28.63]Okay.
[163:30.05]Okay.
[163:37.45]We're going to...
[163:42.46]I'm making a wrestler now, and it's going to be a good wrestler.
[163:45.70]He's going to be strong.
[163:50.66]He's going to be fearsome.
[163:51.96]He's going to obey all the rules and everything.
[163:55.08]It's going to be fine.
[163:55.94]We're going to make me strong.
[163:59.88]He's going to be huge.
[164:04.56]What's a good place to start?
[164:08.40]What's an actually famous place where I'm not going to get immediately kicked out
[164:16.17]Is it Hollywood?
[164:17.85]Or Revolution?
[164:18.51]AAW?
[164:21.51]Okay.
[164:22.09]We're going to change... Uh... Splatter.
[164:37.47]I'm gonna make this quick.
[164:49.36]This guy's gonna be very good.
[164:53.01]No, not me, strip.
[164:58.37]Why did that auto-fill?
[165:01.21]What?
[165:03.13]I'm so confused.
[165:04.24]Me, strong.
[165:58.13]This one.
[166:11.62]He's gonna come out with like a bat.
[166:18.49]If I come out with cash, can I just take it and it's at $400?
[166:20.85]Definitely a hammer.
[166:32.24]Or a pizza?
[166:33.22]Plank.
[166:35.44]Alright, strong.
[166:39.38]It's gonna be 99% strong.
[166:41.85]Ah, that's too much.
[166:42.59]That's not fair.
[166:43.65]Let's say like 92.
[166:49.25]Really, really good attitude as well.
[166:52.45]Me strip.
[166:53.47]No, this is me strong.
[167:00.74]I think 85 popularity of Mii Strong is very popular.
[167:04.80]At least 85.
[167:05.54]Okay, this is fine.
[167:07.52]I'm okay with this.
[167:13.13]Not too egregious, right?
[167:16.33]You think 85 okay?
[167:16.83]Mii Stripped.
[167:28.38]Well, okay, let's take the skill down, because if he's really this strong, then, I mean, he's supposed to be, like, a caveman, so... Beast Rift.
[167:45.40]There.
[167:45.60]You happy?
[167:51.71]Now he's not OP.
[168:01.29]Alright, age.
[168:08.68]Not 55.
[168:09.12]7'10", that's too big, isn't it?
[168:10.14]6'5".
[168:16.28]6'5", is okay.
[168:23.55]Okay.
[168:43.07]Yeah, I need, like, caveman face.
[168:45.29]Okay, shave.
[168:46.71]Mmm, no.
[169:20.54]It looks like my face.
[169:23.72]That's kind of freaking me out.
[169:32.30]This is freaking me the fuck out right now.
[169:45.05]Okay, uh, we gotta find a good one.
[169:54.52]I kind of like this one.
[169:55.42]Alright, 39.
[170:07.25]Definitely 39.
[170:07.81]I don't think I need to see anything else.
[170:08.93]Yeah, 39 for sure.
[170:29.11]Baggy skin?
[170:41.16]How do I get rid of those armbands?
[170:48.37]Material?
[170:49.11]I don't want any material on my arms.
[170:51.95]How do I get rid of this?
[170:59.36]What?
[170:59.64]Yeah, what is his plaid arm?
[171:01.18]I don't know how to take this off.

[171:43.48]I need chest hair.
[172:01.29]No, no fishnets.
[172:04.66]Is this denim?
[172:05.66]Oh my goodness, it's denim.
[172:13.74]The denim is so weird.
[172:15.44]Okay, I want the denim for some reason.
[172:20.42]Okay.
[172:26.65]There it is.
[172:28.01]How do you copy?
[172:29.05]Can I copy this?
[172:30.27]It looks like I can, right?
[172:56.18]No!
[172:56.40]I'm gonna kick the shit out of everybody, by the way.
[173:00.20]Okay, looks good.
[173:01.48]Looks good.
[173:02.36]What's going on with his arms?
[173:25.03]Oh, baggy sleeves.
[173:29.01]What's happening?
[173:29.95]Oh.
[173:56.10]Casual can have glasses, it's fine.
[173:57.54]Okay, no collar.
[173:58.34]That's fine.
[174:00.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[174:01.98]Okay, I need to change this.
[174:26.89]Do that.
[174:29.23]Okay.

[174:35.20]Can this knock him off?
[174:43.80]There we go.
[174:44.12]Okay.
[174:44.40]I got it.
[175:09.36]No, I don't... Me strip.
[175:16.66]Coward.
[175:17.26]Alright, the moves... Okay, I don't want... No partners, no nothing.
[175:36.14]No partners.
[175:37.86]No story friends.
[175:38.58]No.
[175:40.70]Promotion All American Wrestling.
[175:42.38]Wrestler.
[175:43.60]Base.
[175:46.88]I think the moves are fine considering it's that character.
[175:49.45]So that's a big heavy character.
[175:51.13]Should be good.
[175:52.29]I don't think I'm going to do much.
[175:55.53]Yeah, this is going to be great.
[176:03.57]Alright.

[177:05.31]I'm ready.

[177:16.50]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[177:18.88]I'm unstoppable now.
[177:30.85]Look at all this damage I just did.
[177:33.35]I see you've just had to take responsibility for what happens behind the scenes, me stripped.
[177:40.91]If you take this route, it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time for your match.
[177:44.34]Yep, I know how this works.
[177:49.24]Only enter when your time is up.
[177:51.00]Amber means somebody else's match is taking place.
[177:53.10]What if I just make my own fucking rules?
[177:55.14]That guy has a gun.
[178:09.69]Look after...
[178:14.34]I know.
[178:14.76]I know.
[178:15.42]I get it.
[178:18.62]It's too much to handle.
[178:19.30]You can always opt out and skip straight to the action.
[178:21.42]I know.
[178:27.74]This is a very weird taunt that I didn't know that I had.
[178:29.74]Me strong.
[178:40.65]Me pick up thing on ground.
[178:43.31]What thing?
[178:45.03]What thing do?
[178:49.55]What thing do?
[178:50.26]I don't think you can shoot the gun.
[179:16.12]You can't shoot the gun.
[179:16.84]I don't have enough intelligence to shoot it.
[179:20.62]I don't think you can shoot backstage.
[179:27.88]There's no ammo.
[179:33.26]Is it my turn?
[179:56.18]Yeah, you can't shoot it.
[180:04.62]Singles match coming up.
[180:07.72]Taunt?
[180:07.98]Yeah, I tried.
[180:11.59]L2 didn't work.
[180:15.93]You can't.
[180:16.39]You're not going to shoot me, right?
[180:22.79]Ow.
[180:24.62]Yeah, you cannot shoot the gun.
[180:33.61]I thought I just killed that guy.
[180:34.63]High turn.
[181:07.88]What did it say?
[181:09.98]I need money more than I need yet another win on my record.
[181:18.61]For $2,000, I can be persuaded to lie down and hand you a victory.
[181:23.27]What?
[181:27.27]Oh, no.
[181:27.61]I have to pay you.
[181:28.71]No, thanks.
[181:30.67]That's not happening.
[181:33.59]The beating I give you will cost more than $2,000.
[181:49.51]Will it now?
[182:11.32]I don't know.
[182:11.84]You can't shoot.
[182:12.30]There's no.
[182:12.68]You can't shoot the gun.
[182:13.24]Unless there's some weird way to do it.
[182:21.41]What the fuck?
[182:26.79]Get up.
[182:29.41]This is way better.
[182:37.41]Me stomp you.

[183:10.85]He just hits us wrong.

[183:19.85]We fight anyone who stand in way.
[183:28.40]Ow.
[183:45.63]Oh my goodness he's breaking my arm.
[183:52.64]I love how the punches are so strong.
[184:01.20]Can we get a pin here?
[184:10.02]You choke!
[184:23.01]Oh my god, he's unbeatable.

[186:07.76]Competition will get stiffer at auto- Oh my god!
[186:31.57]I'm more skillful than you, Meastrip.
[186:32.95]Don't start something you can't finish.
[186:35.24]Why don't we take this outside?
[186:42.66]Let's take it outside!
[186:43.40]Oh.
[187:04.42]He can't be tamed Somebody needs to stop him
[187:52.65]Why would he know what the stutter is?
[187:56.43]Why would he know what that is?
[188:03.57]They're all trying to get away so bad
[188:23.14]Alright, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[188:25.56]I can't just do this every time.
[188:30.32]Do I get popularity points for coming and just causing a fucking ruckus?
[188:33.54]I thought that guy's name was Glitter Andy.
[188:37.12]I need health.
[188:59.76]What?
[188:59.94]I need to go to bed.
[189:15.26]Oh my God, what a brilliant idea.
[189:26.62]We sleep on park bench.
[189:28.26]We don't know what bed is.
[189:32.88]I don't like you.
[189:37.94]Be scared for it.
[190:01.83]That's better.
[190:04.65]Me sleep.
[190:15.59]Territorial.
[190:20.46]Me refuse to pay income tax.
[190:34.11]Alright, singles match.
[190:36.92]We're at 9 o'clock.
[190:41.16]Sounds good.
[190:48.34]Ow!
[190:50.73]I want the skateboard.
[190:52.21]I'm taking it with me.
[190:53.05]I'm going to the bar.
[190:56.91]Dull joke from chat.
[190:59.16]I did.
[191:00.50]You alright?
[191:01.66]Looks like you had a late night Mii strip.
[191:03.12]Go to sleep at a sensible time for more energy.
[191:05.24]What's this guy doing?
[191:14.07]Mii drink.
[191:17.59]Perfect.
[191:25.83]This is 9am bar visit.
[191:27.77]Is it?
[191:28.19]No, it's not that early.
[191:47.00]Wait, can I just drink this stuff?
[191:51.87]Oh my goodness, I'm sorry.
[192:04.12]You're on fire.
[192:14.60]Another stunner.
[192:15.43]Alright, I have a match in like an hour.
[192:24.47]Honestly, it doesn't matter.
[192:25.25]I'll be fine.
[192:32.26]That guy wasn't even looking at me.
[192:33.74]This is such a shit show.
[192:37.32]It seriously is.
[192:40.20]Oh my god.
[192:47.01]What was thing?
[192:50.55]What is this?
[192:52.09]Strange thing.
[192:53.77]Delicious.
[192:55.19]Must eat more.
[192:57.93]More.
[192:59.62]Bring more food.
[193:03.57]Usually eat.
[193:05.61]Cockish of animal.
[193:14.52]I have a match.
[193:22.54]I don't know where it is.
[193:23.96]Where is it?
[193:24.36]Over here?
[193:25.40]Where is it?
[193:25.96]Right here?
[193:26.44]I don't know.
[193:28.09]I actually forget where it is.
[193:46.19]I showed up an hour late to the match.
[193:48.13]They wouldn't even be doing this anymore.
[193:54.00]They waited an hour for me to get here?
[193:55.48]I was supposed to be out here cutting another promo, but screw that.
[194:03.85]I got something real to say.
[194:08.93]The truth is that all American wrestling is getting slaughtered in the ratings by weekend warriors.
[194:16.79]And you can blame Matt Showman for that.
[194:19.05]Everybody knows I should be the world champion.
[194:24.71]Is there a perfect Sean as the future of this company?
[194:27.79]We all know who should be the United States champion.
[194:32.35]Probably going to be fired for this, but I don't care.
[194:34.11]The important thing is that the truth heard is heard for once.
[194:43.09]I don't think you want to go blow to blow with these strips.
[194:45.77]That's a big problem.
[194:46.75]I don't think that was a... What a dummy.
[194:49.96]What a dummy.
[195:11.79]Good.
[195:12.29]Good.
[195:12.89]Good.
[195:15.69]What is... What is... What is... Let me strong some moves.
[195:17.83]There you go.
[195:22.78]Big suplex.
[195:35.57]Alright.
[195:36.57]When do I get the title match?
[195:37.61]Because I'm obviously better than everybody here.
[195:45.34]Big powerbomb.
[195:45.92]Let's see it.
[195:54.54]People like me strip, right?
[195:57.86]Really good ratings, right?
[196:00.41]I gotta go find the title holder.
[196:02.01]Okay.
[196:03.93]Sounds good.
[196:11.07]Just hang him here.
[196:11.73]Let the blood flow.
[196:21.60]I think I'm gonna stun... Yeah, it's a stunner.
[196:29.00]Why does he have a stunner?
[196:30.94]That's so stupid.
[196:34.76]No one's beating me.
[196:43.04]Alright, that was... Relax.
[197:03.40]Is he finally dead?
[197:04.74]Did he go too hard?
[197:05.98]Did he go too hard?
[197:14.71]Alright, let's go.
[197:42.20]Profile has improved.
[197:43.26]I'm just ruining careers at this point.
[197:48.98]God.
[197:51.16]This game is so ridiculous.
[197:53.10]It just really is.
[197:53.84]So outrageous.
[197:57.67]I wish I... Maybe I should have spent some time to learn about the general manager mode.
[198:06.17]But this is exactly what I wanted to do.
[198:13.55]Alright, I should probably... What should I spend your money on?
[198:17.53]What do you spend money on?
[198:23.73]Show is finished.
[198:24.39]Alright, time for bed.
[198:33.94]He's still up.
[198:44.07]Did you catch that in mid-air?
[198:45.05]Alright, go to bed, bed, bed, bed, bed, bed, bed.
[198:49.81]Oh wait, what about the studio?
[198:57.71]I'm notable enough to talk, right?
[198:59.55]At this point, I think I am.
[199:04.64]Oh wait, actually doing taxes.
[199:05.86]I heard you've been starting fights, me strip.
[199:10.64]You need to save that energy for the ring.
[199:16.24]If you make this unsafe for work environment, then I'll just have to keep you out of it.
[199:30.34]We're pleased to be joined in the studio by MeStrip of All American Wrestling.
[199:36.79]You ever heard of someone called Winston Barker from Maple Leaf Grappling?
[199:44.59]I'm a huge fan.
[199:46.49]Winston Barker is an asshole.
[199:50.91]Well, let's just hope you don't bump into Winston Barker.
[199:53.41]You might regret saying that.
[199:57.78]We never have any regrets.
[200:00.00]If you had to guess what percentage of your matches would you say you've won throughout your career so far?
[200:05.76]This is where Lee Strong holds up his hand.
[200:10.03]And has his one finger up.
[200:13.79]And he looks at it for a long time.
[200:17.97]Me have two.
[200:21.34]Me win two.
[200:28.24]That's exactly right.
[200:29.22]You obviously pay attention to every aspect of this sport.
[200:35.54]How do you like working for Lance Monaco at All-American Wrestling?
[200:38.92]This is him right here.
[200:46.00]I like.
[200:49.46]Oh, Lance Monaco will be happy to hear that.
[200:51.10]I'm sure you'd be there for a long time.
[200:54.86]Lance Monaco is an asshole.
[200:58.35]You came across really well, me strip.
[201:00.47]Thanks for your time.
[201:14.53]You know you can initiate conversations with people by taunting in their direction?
[201:17.24]There's another person in here.
[201:38.39]What the fuck?
[201:40.17]What?
[201:41.95]Hi, MeStrip.
[201:42.45]Do you have time to answer some questions for an article we're writing?
[201:50.55]What box?
[201:52.11]Yes?
[201:52.39]Thanks for doing this, MeStrip.
[201:56.11]It'll be a great opportunity to raise your profile.
[202:01.01]Let's talk about your relations.
[202:03.43]Who would you say your best friend is right now?
[202:10.83]Lance Monaco is my best friend.
[202:12.57]It's the last person I talked to.
[202:16.43]Oh, Lance Monaco will be happy to hear about that.
[202:22.24]I'm sure he feels the same way.
[202:23.60]It's literally the last person I spoke to.
[202:26.68]Tell us about your career at All-American Wrestling.
[202:29.18]How much are they paying you right now?
[202:35.95]I don't know.
[202:39.83]How much?
[202:40.73]Is it 24?
[202:41.51]2000.
[202:48.67]You're worth every penny, MeStrip.
[202:50.70]I can see you take this business seriously.
[202:56.34]Setting aside your personal feelings, which promotion do you think has the highest TV ratings?
[203:06.29]Yes, Sun!
[203:08.09]Sun does rise!
[203:13.09]No, Rising Sun is not.
[203:14.83]It's only at 87%.
[203:15.47]Seems you don't care what happens outside the ring.
[203:18.31]I think you came across quite well.
[203:22.25]Thanks for your time.
[203:23.11]We're pleased to be joined in the studio by me, Strip of All-American Wrestling.
[203:44.71]What is going on in here?
[203:46.45]You seem to have heat with Winston Barker, so tell us how you feel about that.
[203:50.11]I just talked about my problem with Barker over there.
[203:55.27]I could never forgive Winston Barker.
[203:58.83]He's just sleeping.
[204:01.27]Oh, the rivalry is never gonna end.
[204:02.90]Tell us about your career at All-American.
[204:08.80]How many weeks have you have left on your contract?
[204:11.32]I have no idea.
[204:16.26]Are we 32?
[204:20.80]Exactly right.
[204:21.50]You obviously take this business pretty seriously.
[204:23.17]Tell us how your training is going.
[204:29.87]How strong would you say you are?
[204:33.09]Strong?
[204:34.41]Me strong!
[204:36.49]Me strong! 95%.
[204:47.32]Strong?
[204:47.88]No, me strip.
[204:49.42]And I get up and start, like, dancing.
[204:53.01]I think you came across quite well, me strip, so thanks for your time.
[204:55.69]That me brother.
[204:57.49]Twin brother.
[204:58.27]Me strong.
[205:15.12]I'm trying to use the phone.
[205:21.61]I don't understand how to use the phone.
[205:31.90]Oh, give me the skateboard.
[206:01.96]Yes, I'll use some new strikes.
[206:04.29]Good, it's important for a fighter to adapt.
[206:06.43]I look forward to... I hit him in the head so hard that he, I guess, thought we were training.
[206:25.54]Hello?
[206:35.64]Somebody said, you factory reset him.
[206:40.16]Oh my god.
[206:40.97]Okay.
[206:43.85]All they would have discovered a new talent known as Slow Petrol.
[206:46.57]I'm at 100%.
[206:46.81]$200,000.
[206:46.83]Damn.
[206:46.99]No show.
[206:47.33]Nothing scheduled.
[207:10.77]To be fair though, let's be honest, if a caveman did come into this world, I wouldn't be surprised if they were fascinated by a skateboard and a cellphone.
[207:20.21]So I think this actually plays into the brand here.
[207:34.87]Me, Strip, I'm here to challenge you to a match on the third week of July.
[207:52.62]On the wall?
[207:56.75]That's not me.
[207:57.19]What are you talking about?
[208:01.89]No, me tired.
[208:02.75]I should have known to be too scared.
[208:07.23]I'll get you one day, me strip.
[208:27.31]Sorry, me phone.
[208:29.63]Sorry.
[208:29.97]Me need take this.
[208:31.61]Hello?
[208:53.75]I don't have match today.
[208:54.59]I can do whatever I want.
[208:57.09]It's like you had a rough night, Meastrip.
[208:58.37]Sleep on a... I've had... I'm literally at almost 100% HP.
[209:03.07]Learn to read.
[209:20.85]Barbershop.
[209:21.37]Ooh, Maddy McFly.
[209:24.25]We're friends.
[209:30.23]Did I get a haircut?
[209:33.55]Who's the barber?
[209:35.67]Is that a threat?
[209:37.91]Is that a threat?
[209:40.04]Is that a threat?
[209:48.36]Was somebody going to cut my hair?
[209:49.46]Let's go.
[209:55.56]I want my haircut.
[209:59.74]Are you the barber?
[210:03.00]I painted a picture of me getting a haircut on this.
[210:06.90]Me want this.
[210:08.46]Me want the Bieber.
[210:09.38]How do I get a haircut?
[210:28.84]Oh, okay, you do it yourself.
[210:31.28]Alright.
[210:40.72]Oh, that's so cool.
[210:54.99]Okay, I'll be nice.
[210:57.25]But I won't be nice to this person.
[211:07.00]Oh, shit.
[211:07.62]Alright, we're going for it.
[211:10.06]Since we're such good friends, do you mind if I have that pipe?
[211:12.12]No.
[211:20.21]No.
[211:29.13]My stick!
[211:32.21]I'm tougher than you, Meastrip.
[211:33.21]Don't start something you can't finish.
[211:34.35]Is this food?
[211:51.10]What is this?
[211:52.92]What the fuck was that?
[211:53.80]What is this?
[211:54.24]Ow!
[212:05.27]I'm gonna go train.
[212:05.79]Go to the gym.
[212:11.55]Oh, they're brass knuckles, okay.
[212:15.34]I want even more strength.
[212:21.60]Is that a Nintendo 64?
[212:27.08]Oh yeah, me and Lance are friends.
[212:30.13]Alright, let's do some weightlifting.
[212:41.62]Better attitude, that's good.
[212:49.26]I'm going right- run and lift at the same time.
[212:51.26]Oh shit, that's bad.
[213:13.79]Can I sleep here?
[213:14.25]Uh, I can sleep in the hospital.
[213:25.35]Slow down, Meester.
[213:26.09]Running might get you there quicker, but it also makes you tired.
[213:28.51]Come on.
[213:39.82]Come on, right here.
[213:40.28]Okay.
[213:41.74]Okay.
[213:45.94]This doctor always has a briefcase and he's always violent.
[213:48.10]Okay.
[213:51.72]65%.
[213:51.74]That's fine.
[213:53.22]Alright, this is a singles hardcore match.
[213:56.04]Bring some water and I'm gonna go beat the absolute shit out of this person.
[214:43.31]My god.
[214:43.79]This is glass.
[214:48.63]I want this.
[214:48.99]Oh my god.
[215:00.11]Thank god I missed.
[215:03.69]Okay, arena time.
[215:05.85]The arena's connected here, right?
[215:07.45]Yeah, backstage.
[215:08.59]God, come on.
[215:09.71]Really?
[215:10.03]I wanted to put somebody through that.
[215:26.35]Hey.
[215:27.91]I want that belt.
[215:31.87]Can I talk to you for a second?
[215:32.71]I want to challenge you for the belt.
[215:38.45]Why are you not paying attention to me at all?
[215:48.64]Talk to me.
[215:51.72]Don't know a wall.
[215:53.18]I mean, kind of, yeah.
[216:07.65]Is it my turn?
[216:08.13]Not yet.
[216:08.35]Alright, hardcore match coming up.
[216:21.08]Wait, is this guy in my... This is my match.
[216:24.08]I'm fighting this guy right now.
[216:26.13]We haven't gone in the ring yet.
[216:39.65]They're waiting for us to come on stage.
[216:44.44]Oh my god.
[216:45.18]Oh no.
[216:45.88]That's bad.
[216:46.82]This is bad.
[216:51.60]What are you waiting for?
[216:52.38]You need to go through the curtain now.
[217:11.33]That was not the right person.
[217:12.83]I thought that was the person I was fighting.
[217:20.23]What happened to the referee?
[217:24.12]Why?
[217:24.46]Is this for a belt?
[217:26.92]Dude, this is for a belt, I think.
[217:27.98]Why are there two referees?
[217:31.48]Why do referees have belts on?
[217:33.38]What the fuck is happening?
[217:35.60]I'm sure you're all aware.
[217:36.42]We're the reigning tag team champions.
[217:38.17]The referees.
[217:43.33]Unfortunately, the competition in this division is so pathetic that we've resorted to finding our own.
[217:47.87]That's why we're pleased to announce that we'll be granting a title shot to whoever wins this match.
[218:20.44]Please don't lose.
[218:22.70]Don't lose.
[218:23.52]I got beat up backstage by a gigantic coin.
[218:27.36]Whatever that was.
[218:28.04]Fuck.
[218:39.50]I gotta get out.
[218:46.00]Okay, I'm fine.
[218:50.90]All I gotta do is just pick this up.
[218:57.34]You piece of shit.
[218:58.96]Give me that.
[219:01.75]Give that to me.
[219:03.01]Oh my god, I got the belt.
[219:08.65]What if I just leave with the belt?
[219:09.49]Can I run away with the belt?
[219:20.56]Don't- Oh, okay.
[219:30.35]What a fucking idiot.
[219:46.96]Please, let me go.
[220:09.51]Club.
[220:09.97]Yeah, it is.
[220:17.41]It's so stupid when that happens.
[220:18.91]This guy's just still standing here.
[220:42.21]How did that catch on fire?
[220:52.36]I actually got it, thank god.
[220:54.90]The random guy with like the mustache is going up here.
[221:08.26]Careful, this thing's gonna fall.
[221:22.73]I need to do something.
[221:23.69]Oh, there's a bat in there.
[221:24.31]Good.
[221:28.59]Get away from me.
[221:29.19]Get away.
[221:29.45]Get away.
[221:43.16]Okay, I got it.
[221:47.87]I'll get the title shot now.
[221:51.59]It's the tag team title?
[221:52.69]I don't have a partner.
[222:04.20]Holy shit.
[222:14.24]Not moving for some reason?
[222:24.74]Dude, stop doing that.
[222:29.82]I'm pinning him when he gets in the ring again.
[222:47.25]This is fucking crazy, man.
[222:49.39]This is crazy.
[223:00.13]You earned your shot at the tag team titles, but I don't have a partner.
[223:04.56]Give what you wish for, I'll turn your dreams into nightmares.
[223:07.90]Appreciate the opportunity, Batarang Ron, but you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
[223:24.03]Adoring Ron is going to die.
[223:25.57]Oh man.
[223:29.32]Oh man.
[223:54.65]This is always such a joke at the end of every match.
[223:56.81]It's just chaos every time.
[224:15.30]He peeked his head out for one second and that's all it took.
[224:24.91]Funeral music?
[224:26.03]I'm being limited by this organization.
[224:29.39]I got a piece of that pie, right?
[224:52.03]Congratulations on winning your third match, MeStrip.
[224:54.05]You remain undefeated at All-American Wrestling.
[224:55.91]Hey, thanks for the congratulations.
[225:00.69]Appreciate it.
[225:01.13]You've been starting fights.
[225:03.37]You need to save that energy for the ring.
[225:09.30]So, I actually should be careful.
[225:10.88]They'll probably kick me out.
[225:15.52]Yeah, I'm going to get kicked out if I don't stop.
[225:27.32]Of course I threw it at like the magician, or whoever that guy is.
[225:49.39]I'm gonna stop, I promise.
[225:50.79]I'm not gonna kill anybody.
[225:56.40]Adam Ringwald's stamina has improved.
[225:57.68]Okay.
[225:58.68]Damn.
[225:59.10]Wait.
[225:59.42]Bentley has developed a heated rivalry with Mike Bale of Wrestling School.
[226:06.06]Isn't that the announcer?
[226:26.75]What's going on this week?
[226:29.47]Jeez.
[226:29.95]What do you think of the new hairstyle our stylist suggested for you?
[226:36.75]Uh...
[226:56.72]Yeah, I was gonna say that.
[227:00.20]It's too clean.
[227:01.99]It's over somebody's he's going corporate Okay, no show here I can roam around Am I still here?
[227:18.72]It's a weird shot
[227:35.64]What?
[227:37.34]Why did I just puke?
[227:41.35]What was that?
[227:43.67]What's wrong with me?
[227:44.53]I don't understand what just happened.
[228:06.00]Alright, can I take a shower?
[228:16.80]What?
[228:17.86]What are you two looking at?
[228:20.84]You and your giant coin, get out of here.
[228:36.07]I didn't start any fight.
[228:36.87]Okay.
[228:45.02]So, I... Does this count as a shower?
[228:46.48]It should, right?
[228:57.77]I think that counts.
[229:00.85]Oh, shit.
[229:01.21]I gotta go... Speaking of toilets, I gotta go pee.
[229:05.72]Alright, I'm staring at beat.
[229:06.69]I've never seen somebody go to the toilet while fully clothed.
[229:48.95]Dude, what's going on?
[229:50.11]It's just, it's mayhem.
[229:52.39]This whole game is mayhem.
[229:56.35]Yeah, fully clothed.
[229:59.39]I'm wearing a pair of underwear.
[230:05.00]These two hate each other.
[230:06.28]Look at this.
[230:06.62]They want to fight so bad.
[230:07.88]What?
[230:11.62]This is not a dick, right?
[230:20.04]Is there a deck?
[230:20.50]No.
[230:25.05]What?
[230:30.17]I don't even know what just happened, but I didn't mean to do that.
[230:31.95]Okay.
[230:40.07]I'm out of here.
[230:41.39]These people are freaking me out.
[231:01.14]Come on.
[231:02.66]I'm losing weight.
[231:03.28]Yeah, there's no match schedule, so I'm good.
[231:28.75]Anything you want to talk about?
[231:36.66]Why am I setting up a shot at pull?
[231:43.00]Oh, that's right.
[231:43.64]I stopped starting fights.
[231:46.85]You're right.
[231:47.77]That's really stupid of me.
[232:07.32]I think that guy wanted my attention, but... That title match is coming up too.
[232:20.83]Vstrip's influence has inspired everybody else in the All-American Wrestling roster to improve their stamina.
[232:35.85]Eight man tag team match.
[232:39.39]How is this gonna work?
[232:40.21]Alright, this is gonna be insane.
[232:42.81]I'll be back.
[232:43.21]I'm gonna pee.
[232:43.85]I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[232:46.19]Here we go.
[233:18.37]Thank you.
[234:39.89]Thank you.
[235:54.86]Okay, I'm back.
[235:55.40]8-man tag.
[236:05.88]I don't know how this is gonna work, but apparently it is.
[236:17.74]Okay, that's good.
[236:29.69]So, I'm gonna just... 8pm, so that's pretty quick.
[236:35.89]Wow, that's one way to get out of bed.
[236:37.45]Holy shit.
[236:42.86]That's like the government CIA... training.
[236:46.78]Like, that's... It's like secret agent training to do that.
[236:51.56]That's insane.
[236:58.88]American Dad, yeah.
[237:00.08]Alright, I got full health.
[237:03.92]I'm not gonna... What's wrong with me?
[237:05.26]Why am I swaying around?
[237:06.00]Did you wash your hands?
[237:11.64]Of course I did.
[237:12.14]Climb to improve... Ah, alright, that's cool.
[237:19.96]Glad I could influence your look, MeStrip.
[237:22.32]I was wondering... I was worried that my legacy would be forgotten when I took this guy's haircut.
[237:32.96]Hold on.
[237:33.74]We have the same haircut.
[237:41.21]Eating and drinking is good for an energy boost, but you'll make yourself sick if you're full.
[237:49.44]I appreciate it.
[237:50.52]Jester.
[237:51.68]We actually have the same haircut.
[237:52.98]I don't even know what this is.
[238:03.36]What happened?
[238:04.32]What?
[238:09.28]Why did I puke?
[238:10.34]He just told you?
[238:14.95]Yeah, I didn't think- I just woke up!
[238:17.95]I slept for nine hours and I wake up and I have a fucking apple and I throw up because I have too much food in my stomach?
[238:26.93]What are you on about?
[238:27.69]What are you on about, game?
[238:29.57]Oh shit, my match.
[238:36.86]This banana was on fire.
[238:51.37]Get out of here.
[238:55.02]Alright.
[239:00.32]It's okay.
[239:00.80]It's an eight-man tag match.
[239:02.20]I'll be fine.
[239:10.09]Who's on my team?
[239:13.44]Oh, just me.
[239:24.30]This is... Shit's going on in the ring right now.
[239:29.42]There are more than eight people here.
[239:30.94]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[239:32.72]There are like twelve people here.
[239:40.37]There are way too many people in the ring.
[239:45.65]Legal.
[239:48.19]What?
[239:49.85]Hold on.
[239:54.21]Do we even know who's on whose team?
[239:56.80]Okay, apparently it's just me, these two.
[240:06.24]I think it's just me and this guy.
[240:15.11]They're not all against me, right?
[240:17.14]I don't think so.
[240:27.38]Take them all out.
[240:28.10]Oh, that's illegal.
[240:32.10]This is illegal.
[240:32.54]I gotta get rid of this.
[240:47.29]Take one step forward.
[240:48.63]I actually look naked.
[241:17.59]Danny DeVito coming out of the couch Nice.
[241:29.87]Pretty good horse tactic Stun him.
[241:39.21]Let's go
[241:47.21]So, what's... Is there a flawless count anywhere?
[241:49.56]Let's find out who's even on my team.
[242:01.80]Me strip looks like my father.
[242:06.15]That's weird.
[242:08.01]That's really weird, dude.
[242:15.51]It's weird.
[242:25.50]It's dead.
[242:28.68]Okay.
[242:29.42]Count it!
[242:33.70]What the hell was the point of all these people?
[242:37.04]What a joke.
[242:37.94]Why were they all here?
[242:44.73]Now you're all in big trouble.
[242:46.95]Ain't nobody getting out of here alive.
[243:07.04]I'm blocking their entrance.
[243:10.80]No one's getting out.
[243:23.01]Oh shit, they're getting out.
[243:26.53]The lock-on is just so hard to switch between people.
[243:36.82]Okay, so what about my status?
[243:37.82]There were two teams, I guess.
[243:40.16]You gonna get fired?
[243:41.54]No, am I?
[243:41.82]I don't think so.
[244:00.83]We're almost at the top.
[244:02.05]Almost at 90%.
[244:03.09]We're almost at number one.
[244:05.31]I got 10 grand.
[244:15.19]That stunner is a nice finisher.
[244:16.44]I can't wait to kick out of it.
[244:19.70]Oh, I can't wait to kick out of it.
[244:20.98]What's the point of this game?
[244:26.20]Become the best wrestler in the world.
[244:34.23]I wasn't even gonna use it.
[244:39.44]I didn't do anything.
[244:44.90]This guy...
[245:02.47]This dude's AI is probably going to throw that eventually here.
[245:07.13]And I'm going to be nowhere near it.
[245:09.35]I didn't do any of this.
[245:10.03]I have nothing to do with this.
[245:17.02]People just squaring up in a lobby.
[245:18.30]Yeah, this is like the beginning of a Fortnite game.
[245:24.24]We're waiting to drop out of the bus.
[245:30.72]Oh, here we go.
[245:31.16]Here we go.
[245:31.42]This is at start.
[245:32.06]It just started.
[245:35.16]There he is.
[245:35.42]That's the guy with the dynamite in his hand.
[245:37.08]You know he's gonna throw it.
[245:40.48]There he is.
[245:42.20]He's gonna take a little too much punishment and he's gonna throw it.
[245:47.74]Only a matter of time.
[245:54.52]He's not throwing it.
[245:56.72]He's smart.
[246:02.08]Alright, I'm out.
[246:02.62]I need to go to sleep.
[246:06.96]Jesus.
[246:07.53]Alright, goodbye.
[246:20.21]Where's the phone?
[246:25.05]It's on the ground somewhere.
[246:25.93]Who knows?
[246:34.35]Is it by the trash?
[246:37.03]Where is it?
[246:39.53]Where's the phone?
[246:44.82]Oh, it was over here.
[246:52.38]It sounded like it was on the right side.
[246:53.67]Alright, hotel room.
[247:08.74]So when does the title shot happen?
[247:10.26]I feel like that was like an hour and a half ago.
[247:16.45]Why are you sleeping in a crib?
[247:38.19]We got a confrontation.
[247:42.47]I'm curious.
[247:43.35]I don't know what it is.
[247:59.88]Why did I get consciousness?
[248:06.74]When MeStrong was... Just like a dumb guy that yelled, I hit you.
[248:12.52]Somebody gave him consciousness.
[248:15.56]How does he get a haircut?
[248:16.40]What do you want?
[248:28.03]MeStrip, I'm tired of being mentioned with the same breath as you.
[248:30.53]It's time to change the conversation.
[248:35.44]Everybody talks about me like I'm your inferior, but we both know that I've always been your superior.
[248:41.54]Down with this sort of thing.
[248:43.09]I'm sure you would prefer me to stay in the shadows, but my light is too bright for that.
[248:46.47]Don't worry about shadows too much, because you won't be seeing any more of those after I knock your lights out.
[249:00.09]I... What do you mean?
[249:01.11]What do you mean?
[249:13.76]She's got a weapon.
[249:23.60]Oh, my goodness.
[249:24.10]That was brutal.
[249:24.64]That was horrible.
[249:26.56]Oh, my God.
[249:27.14]Alright.
[249:27.52]I did it.
[249:27.86]I did it.
[249:28.46]I did it.
[249:28.72]I beat you up.
[249:29.75]I did it.
[249:30.05]I'm good.
[249:30.49]I'm good.
[249:30.77]I did it.
[249:39.79]Poor guy.
[249:41.35]I don't want to...
[249:46.27]That was the guy with the dynamite, by the way.
[249:48.40]I guess I... He's... Fine, I... Oh, shit.
[250:09.88]I... How do I stop?
[250:14.53]Okay, I did it.
[250:15.17]I'm done.
[250:19.62]Bro, back off.
[250:23.87]Okay.
[250:24.27]Alright.
[250:24.61]I did.
[250:24.85]That was it.
[250:25.67]Okay.
[250:25.87]Goodbye.
[250:26.13]Oh my god.
[250:44.18]Oh shit.
[250:44.64]Okay.
[250:44.90]I might actually lose.
[250:51.37]Me strong never loses, by the way.
[251:00.61]When does this stop?
[251:01.71]It was like, oh, confrontation.
[251:03.41]I'll beat you up.
[251:04.70]Okay.
[251:05.40]We've concluded that we both have been beaten up.
[251:11.78]It's been concluded that we beat each other up.
[251:16.76]Is it a pin?
[251:18.98]I don't think so.
[251:42.15]That hurts.
[251:44.39]That really hurts.
[251:46.29]I just damaged all my internal organs.
[252:05.02]I just have it out for this guy.
[252:06.14]I don't know why.
[252:17.85]Stop starting fights.
[252:19.13]But it's like GTA.
[252:22.29]In Grand Theft Auto.
[252:24.55]When you're walking around.
[252:26.23]And there's just a person.
[252:27.17]So you just like run into them.
[252:46.60]Okay.
[252:47.58]We'd make a pretty good team, MeStrip.
[252:49.48]How would you like to make it a regular thing?
[252:50.78]This is the guy that I've been beating up every day.
[252:56.88]We can make a much bigger impact together.
[252:58.30]You know what?
[253:05.91]Yeah.
[253:06.55]Sure.
[253:07.99]I need a tag team partner for the tag team championship.
[253:32.50]This is it.
[253:33.50]Alright, this is the big one.
[253:35.29]Tag Team Championship.
[253:38.59]I kind of feel like an idiot because I've probably brought this guy's health and stamina down by like 80% of the last three days.
[253:45.13]This guy gets no rest.
[253:47.49]I see him and I attack him.
[253:49.66]I've hit this guy in the head with more objects than are currently in my office right now.
[253:55.80]I'm kind of causing a problem for myself.
[254:01.34]What is gimmick?
[254:02.96]Uh, gimmick I think is just your kind of character sheet.
[254:05.46]Alright, tag team championship.
[254:14.21]You still have the... Okay, let's go.
[254:18.35]I'll see you when we... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[254:26.17]Hold on a minute.
[254:27.29]Hold on a minute.
[254:27.93]Can you get... No, you cannot.
[254:30.91]No.
[254:32.98]What just happened?
[254:35.58]Why did he just fall down?
[254:40.10]What did he just do?
[254:41.44]He just fell over.
[254:45.46]He attacked her?
[254:56.49]Why?
[254:56.91]We don't try to make problems with other people.
[255:02.78]Alright, I don't want to mess around.
[255:05.00]Hey Meastrip, can I have that phone?
[255:09.40]Sure.
[255:12.30]I'm roaming right now, so... Don't make any long distance calls.
[255:15.96]I know exactly what I'm going to do with it.
[255:22.33]Make a phone call.
[255:23.17]That was so threatening for no reason.
[255:27.15]That's a 2001 joke.
[255:29.95]Oh, please.
[255:30.45]Thanks for the phone back.
[255:38.99]Alright, I think I dialed the wrong number.
[255:40.11]I was hoping to speak to Karen Mahoney.
[255:44.32]Who did you call?
[255:45.14]I didn't... It wasn't me.
[255:55.60]It was somebody else.
[255:56.26]Nice try.
[256:10.75]Where's my tag team partner?
[256:19.11]Any minute now, we're going on stage.
[256:30.40]I just keep thinking of that guy's dad.
[256:32.38]I don't know why.
[256:33.52]That guy's dad in chat.
[256:39.24]I don't know why it's freaking me out.
[256:42.79]I don't know where my partner is, but we gotta go.
[256:44.01]This is for the Tag Team Championship.
[256:52.03]Me, Strip, and Bubba Hyena.
[256:54.42]Alright, there you are.
[257:17.75]Bahain and I have joined forces to become even greater than the sum of our parts.
[257:25.64]All the other teams in All American Wrestling better watch out because we just raised the bar.
[257:33.15]That's right, but actions speak louder than words, so let's show these people what we're about.
[257:52.76]Like an idiot.
[257:56.30]Dumbass.
[257:58.34]Do that again.
[257:59.74]Look where you're fucking going.
[258:09.33]Seriously, the people on the other team right now seriously need to shut the fuck up, okay?
[258:26.82]You might tap out from this, I think.
[258:33.12]Whoa!
[258:35.92]I caught his leg in mid-air.
[258:45.01]Oh, no.
[258:46.31]Oh, no.
[258:46.63]This is it.
[259:15.74]It's so long.
[259:22.67]Am I joking?
[259:32.21]They're lying.
[259:34.15]They're not even fighting.
[259:35.94]What are they doing over there?
[259:38.14]He's like rubbing his leg.
[259:41.10]What the fuck?
[259:54.55]Oh, that was so dumb.
[259:55.59]That was so long.
[260:01.64]You can't tell me those two were seriously just sitting there lying down.
[260:05.38]You guys are going to kill me.
[260:19.07]Stop.
[260:25.05]Alright, let's get back to reality here.
[260:32.22]Goddamn.
[260:39.40]Yeah.
[261:02.52]The crowd is silent.
[261:05.80]It was just, like, awkward.
[261:07.04]I don't, like, I, like, this was bad.
[261:08.91]This sucked.
[261:10.99]What a shitty match.
[261:14.07]Four people were just, like, lying down, like, next to each other.
[261:19.57]Why am I still joking?
[261:32.97]Okay, I gotta get up I
[262:18.67]Oh, okay, I'm getting out of here.
[262:21.08]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[262:24.38]The music.
[262:27.44]Oh, it's... Alright, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
[262:30.74]Enough.
[262:32.58]Ugh.
[262:33.36]Oh, we're just lying down.
[262:36.95]Ugh.
[262:45.34]Honestly, what really kept me going there was the audience.
[262:48.72]It was just quiet, man.
[262:50.41]Quiet.
[262:51.77]Silent.
[262:54.39]Like, god damn.
[262:58.35]That was the tag team championship.
[263:00.04]You got two guys coming out in, like, fucking gimp suits.
[263:08.20]Just lying down.
[263:16.28]Okay.
[263:19.82]And then you kept going.
[263:20.72]I don't know, man.
[263:21.54]It was just... Got those belts on, though.
[263:37.89]You believe we're tag team champions?
[263:39.53]Look how far we've come together.
[263:46.60]Yeah, look what we have.
[263:52.13]Shake hands.
[263:53.33]Alright.
[263:54.29]Okay.
[263:57.03]Somebody's jealous.
[263:58.81]Where are you taking him?
[264:01.39]Where are you taking him?
[264:03.21]I'm on my way to the hotel.
[264:04.13]You need a ride?
[264:05.37]Um... Sure?
[264:07.74]We can walk across the street.
[264:14.87]Just follow me and I'll get you to the hotel as soon as possible.
[264:17.17]Bro, it's across the street.
[264:18.80]We're gonna both walk there.
[264:27.18]What do you want?
[264:27.80]What are you doing?
[264:38.25]Okay.
[264:38.35]It's friendly.
[264:40.35]Why do you have that?
[264:40.95]I don't want you looking at this.
[264:42.71]I'm putting this somewhere safe.
[264:53.77]Just go to bed.
[264:54.65]Whatever.
[264:55.01]What are you doing out this late?
[265:09.10]You should probably get a good night's sleep.
[265:12.75]I'm about to do that.
[265:13.67]Can I have a title shot?
[265:18.55]What was that?
[265:38.92]Why am I holding the championship belt?
[265:40.92]Am I asleep?
[265:46.23]Am I having like memories?
[265:47.53]Like flashbacks?
[265:51.97]Go to bed!
[265:52.41]Go to sleep!
[266:16.26]Boomtown has been released by Wrestling Revolution.
[266:18.36]Oh, no.
[266:24.34]Y-Tide's feud with MeStrip appears to have lost momentum and is no longer over with the fans.
[266:32.63]What happened to my health?
[266:34.93]After five hours of comfortable sleep, MeStrip's energy levels are at 84%.
[266:38.33]What happened?
[266:41.43]MeStrip has come down with an illness and is in poor health this week.
[266:51.28]I didn't die in my sleep, right?
[267:05.35]No ring tag elimination?
[267:07.27]But look at me.
[267:08.03]He's going to have to carry.
[267:09.57]Your energy looks a little low.
[267:14.56]You can't eat that.
[267:17.32]That's not edible.
[267:19.26]Bro, that's not... Bro!
[267:20.56]He's trying to kill me!
[267:21.64]He's trying to kill me!
[267:22.26]Get him!
[267:23.56]He poisoned me in my sleep!
[267:25.16]He poisoned me in my sleep!
[267:27.49]Get him!
[267:28.01]Tell me to kill him!
[267:32.95]How could you do this to me?
[267:33.89]What?
[267:34.97]What's happening?
[267:36.19]Help!
[267:37.07]Help!
[267:37.43]He's killing us!
[267:39.15]I need to have... What, are you wearing the same costume as me?
[267:44.58]What are you talking about?
[267:47.05]No, you should dress like me.
[267:48.49]Who's talking here?
[267:49.39]I don't want to dress like you.
[267:51.19]Let's just leave things as they are.
[268:02.00]No, I'll be fine.
[268:14.08]You may have beat me in the ring, but the result will be different outside the ring.
[268:17.34]He poisoned me in my sleep, and he tried to kill my friend.
[268:23.95]Stop him.
[268:27.25]Stop him.
[268:28.39]I'm clinging to my last.
[268:29.75]The belt will always be mine, even in death.
[268:38.76]You don't want trouble?
[268:39.70]You shouldn't have fucking poisoned me.
[268:48.87]Get him.
[268:50.25]Nice job.
[268:59.51]He's not talking to me, right?
[269:03.32]Why am I sad in the corner?
[269:12.12]Somebody help?
[269:16.37]I feel like this is the one ring.
[269:17.71]Oh my god, we have to get in the ring.
[269:19.02]I feel like Gollum right now.
[269:21.86]Alright, we gotta go.
[269:23.40]We have to go.
[269:29.12]I need food.
[269:29.82]I need something to eat.
[269:31.48]Quick.
[269:32.90]I need water or something.
[269:34.04]Food, water.
[269:40.18]Leave me the fuck alone.
[269:41.14]Unless you have food.
[269:53.82]Food?
[269:55.34]Is there water on the ground?
[269:56.46]I need a water bottle or something.
[269:58.26]Anything.
[269:59.74]Anything.
[270:02.46]What the fuck?
[270:06.59]Battering happens to be a friend of mine.
[270:08.25]I just... Dude, let me up!
[270:15.36]Where's my tag partner?
[270:16.38]Oh!
[270:34.53]Square the fucking balls.
[270:38.19]Whose phone?
[270:41.37]We have a match.
[270:45.89]Please.
[270:46.37]Does anybody have any water?
[270:50.16]Is there any water?
[270:51.48]Or anything?
[270:52.14]Food?
[270:52.58]Grapes?
[270:53.00]I'll take bananas.
[270:57.72]Oh shit.
[270:59.90]Me strip and graffiti?
[271:03.58]Who's Graffiti?
[271:04.48]Where's my tag partner?
[271:06.52]Last week Graffiti and I became the new tag team champions.
[271:09.16]That's not their name.
[271:13.40]It was like Bobby Hyena.
[271:15.95]We told everybody we're the best when we first got together and now it's official.
[271:19.97]That's my partner.
[271:24.29]We're going to bring legitimacy back to tag wrestling.
[271:27.33]Am I shit-faced?
[271:29.90]Don't expect us to break up anytime soon because the only teams we break up are our opponents.
[271:34.06]No, my guy's over here.
[271:37.62]We got to the top sticking together and that chemistry would keep us at the top.
[271:47.18]This is my guy right here.
[271:48.50]I'm holding the other end of the belt.
[271:51.86]I'm not going over there.
[271:53.06]They can fucking kill each other for all I care.
[272:10.83]Get away from me, get away, get away, get away.
[272:19.51]If you wanna hit me, you're gonna have to go through Bobby Hyena.
[272:25.77]That guy has water?
[272:26.55]He does.
[272:31.65]Jesus Christ.
[272:33.36]I'm gonna die.
[272:41.09]No, he's drinking it in front of me to spite me.
[272:43.37]Do you see that?
[272:45.48]No, please.
[272:46.12]That was too heavy.
[273:01.81]Give me that water.
[273:02.65]Give me that water now.
[273:06.51]Give me the water.
[273:08.21]No, I don't want this useless piece of junk.
[273:17.28]Where's the water?
[273:24.36]You guys have water over here?
[273:25.96]They might.
[273:26.26]They're like a commentary table.
[273:31.11]No.
[273:34.63]I think we need to break this up.
[273:37.79]I just want f***ing water.
[273:39.45]Just give me the water.
[273:40.21]He's sitting there just drinking and taunting me with it.
[273:44.45]This guy is...
[273:54.45]Step on him!
[273:55.43]Stomp!
[273:58.05]He's gonna win this fight right now!
[274:01.13]You guys understand the gravity of this situation right now?
[274:06.46]Give me that fucking water, you dumbass clown.
[274:09.36]Give me the water!
[274:12.26]I got it!
[274:18.73]You piece of shit.
[274:21.73]Drank the whole goddamn thing.
[274:29.80]How is anybody going to get pinned?
[274:45.71]This lady was just watching.
[274:49.39]I think it's... Yeah, I can pin somebody.
[274:51.97]If I can just get the bat.
[274:59.41]Get him off me, please.
[275:00.76]Somebody.
[275:01.06]This is it, right?
[275:10.00]Just no one's gonna get pinned.
[275:13.42]Just go sit in the chair.
[275:30.32]Count it, count it.
[275:30.80]Am I actually still on the ground?
[275:36.94]Just leave the match?
[275:37.70]I think I'll lose my tag team belt, won't I?
[275:39.56]Is this a championship match or no?
[275:42.92]I have no idea.
[275:54.63]What are you doing?
[276:01.39]If I can pin the Joker, I'll be fine.
[276:10.62]I hear a fire.
[276:11.20]Give me that fucking belt.
[276:21.21]Come out here without me.
[276:22.97]Pretending like we're not a goddamn team.
[276:24.33]Give me that.
[276:37.43]Pin?
[276:43.58]Count it!
[276:48.93]Why is the ref on fire?
[277:08.52]That's it.
[277:10.99]Are you serious?
[277:14.95]This guy has zero HP.
[277:17.95]Zero.
[277:25.09]He's talking into the microphone.
[277:27.05]Dude.
[277:28.75]Both of you idiots.
[277:32.76]It's gonna have to be the Jester.
[277:43.88]It's got a Nintendo 64 and the belt.
[277:49.24]Get up!
[277:59.05]Is he about to leave the match?
[278:13.06]Okay.
[278:17.74]Spin him around.
[278:18.64]Oh my god.
[278:21.76]Get a pin.
[278:25.67]That should be it.
[278:26.69]Thank god.
[278:29.77]One... What?
[278:30.51]I don't get it.
[278:52.29]I don't understand.
[278:55.21]I have to eliminate the partners?
[279:00.49]Oh, that's annoying.
[279:10.32]You know something?
[279:13.48]This lady, Sharon, has not been fighting at all.
[279:17.44]She still has the belt around her waist.
[279:21.30]Really?
[279:27.08]Who turned the lights off?
[279:28.86]Why is the power off?
[279:34.01]Somebody cut the power!
[279:44.27]Now we're friends?
[279:46.60]After all that bullshit?
[279:48.20]Now you come and raise my hand?
[279:51.30]After all that?
[279:54.34]Really?
[279:59.90]What the hell was that?
[280:00.92]I don't know who that was.
[280:05.82]Somebody shook my hand and I fucking hit him in the head with a bat.
[280:08.22]I don't know what that was.
[280:10.44]They freaked me out.
[280:11.04]I thought they were grabbing me.
[280:11.96]I'm hurt again.
[280:13.28]I'm still sick.
[280:35.12]Alright, that's not a bad rating.
[280:37.90]Who's graffiti?
[280:42.84]I have no idea, man.
[280:44.24]I really don't.
[280:45.06]I think the game bugged out and thought we were tag team partners.
[280:50.18]I have both belts, which is weird.
[281:04.91]You want your belt?
[281:05.59]Take your belt back, man.
[281:09.37]Yeah, here.
[281:09.93]Take your... Take that back.
[281:11.72]That's yours.
[281:12.12]Okay, Glitter Andy.
[281:22.11]I want the phone.
[281:22.83]Okay, I'm out.
[281:30.13]I don't know what this guy's doing.
[281:33.82]Oh yeah, we have the same haircut, I remember.
[281:35.82]You and I, we're cool.
[281:45.56]Please go to the doctor.
[281:48.86]Um, okay.
[282:16.77]What can I do for you?
[282:24.29]That's weird.
[282:30.38]Alright.
[282:32.58]Into the hospital bed.
[282:35.26]Good night.
[282:39.29]I don't know why the doctor is hostile since the very beginning.
[282:41.79]It's like Dark Souls.
[282:42.75]I R1'd him three times and he just is permanently hostile towards me.
[282:46.19]I don't know why.
[282:49.37]Alright, I think I'm back in better health.
[282:54.86]You should talk to him.
[282:56.54]Meastrip, what do you think of the new outfit our wardrobe department created for you?
[283:02.82]That's it.
[283:15.77]No.
[283:18.67]You obviously don't know anything about fashion.
[283:23.17]This is what all the kids are wearing these days.
[283:26.05]We have to defend the belts?
[283:29.75]10pm today.
[283:30.55]What?
[283:30.65]Hello?
[283:31.21]Wait.
[283:45.83]Hello?
[283:46.11]If you're looking for Yuri Yakuza, I saw him in the bar.
[283:52.84]Okay.
[283:56.25]Other fuckers at the bar?
[284:14.28]Listen, I'm not sure the name MeStrip captures the essence of your character.
[284:17.56]How would you like to be something called something like Glitter Cesar?
[284:31.13]No.
[284:35.15]Did I make you sound like you have a choice?
[284:36.27]Your name is Glitter Cesar now.
[284:37.80]Get used to it.
[284:45.15]I thought we were friends.
[284:46.01]Alright, where's this person that the phone said go find this person?
[284:56.58]Where is this person?
[285:03.47]Oh, I don't know what you did that for.
[285:05.55]I don't have any idea.
[285:06.35]Why did you do that?
[285:21.94]This is the- I can't miss this, this is the tag- Oh my god, what happened to my- what happened?
[285:28.20]Oh my god, what happened?
[285:31.52]What?
[285:34.36]Oh my health!
[285:36.64]Help!
[285:37.14]Somebody help me!
[285:39.22]What the fuck?
[285:40.77]This is a te- this is a championship match!
[285:44.35]What do you mean take a nap?
[285:47.83]Huh?
[285:52.22]You piece of fucking shit.
[285:53.50]Who did that?
[285:54.86]Okay, Redneck Rothstein.
[285:56.36]Remember that.
[285:59.18]I hit my head on the asphalt.
[286:00.92]God damn it.
[286:02.14]The show's about to start.
[286:11.03]Where's the entrance?
[286:13.69]Where's the entrance?
[286:23.78]That was bullshit.
[286:24.62]It really was.
[286:27.46]Really?
[286:28.34]This is such a crock of shit.
[286:31.06]No way.
[286:31.62]No way.
[286:35.87]Your brain is leaking.
[286:38.13]Somebody said, nice Tony Hawk hair.
[286:45.15]Glitter, Scissor, and Bubba Hyena.
[286:47.27]No, that's not my name.
[287:02.74]Why are we fighting against these guys again?
[287:09.40]We're fighting... We just beat you.
[287:11.88]You're too young to be a champion, Glitter says her.
[287:13.97]You haven't got a clue what that responsibility means.
[287:17.07]Wrestling is more of a marathon than a sprint, and that's why I've been awarded the gold medal.
[287:27.53]I'm not doing alright.
[287:33.44]Oops.
[287:35.37]I need to tag out.
[287:39.97]Tag out.
[287:40.57]Thank you.
[287:40.95]Alright, go get him.
[287:48.72]Oh, I just... What?
[287:50.70]I just tagged him.
[288:00.65]Didn't I just tag his hand?
[288:08.27]The ref didn't see it.
[288:09.39]Where's the other... Where's his teammate?
[288:12.67]Come on, tag.
[288:18.69]Tag.
[288:19.52]There we go.
[288:21.04]Alright.
[288:21.62]You know what to do.
[288:29.42]Good.
[288:30.02]Good exchange.
[288:34.25]Get back in there.
[288:35.53]You got full health, man.
[288:36.45]You got to take care of this.
[288:38.95]I'm going to go sit down.
[288:39.91]That's a good idea.
[288:46.23]Money Mark, I need you to get out of that chair.
[288:53.29]Why am I getting counted out?
[288:54.20]I'm not even a legal person here.
[289:00.44]I'm not... What are you talking about?
[289:04.54]What?
[289:06.86]Get... No, tag back in.
[289:08.32]Get back up here.
[289:15.31]Get in there.
[289:22.05]Excuse me?
[289:22.79]What the hell?
[289:30.46]Help.
[289:30.68]He's going to beat us.
[289:40.03]I can't even get up.
[289:41.23]Oh!
[289:42.69]He caught me like, help!
[289:45.99]This is the championship, you can't do this.
[289:51.16]Tag in!
[289:52.94]Thank you!
[289:53.74]Jesus, don't tag me out.
[289:55.26]I need to go sit in the chair and relax.
[290:01.76]Get me out of here.
[290:04.30]Roll out of the ring!
[290:05.36]Where are you going with this table?
[290:14.69]I can't move.
[290:18.21]I'd love to get up.
[290:25.72]Okay.
[290:28.18]Do not tag me in, dude.
[290:30.08]Please.
[290:33.18]Spend one goddamn minute fighting the other guy.
[290:35.88]This is actually working.
[291:04.72]This is the worst fight ever.
[291:05.82]Is there a drink on the ground?
[291:08.96]There is.
[291:18.31]Where is there?
[291:18.65]Where do you see a drink?
[291:28.36]By the chair?
[291:29.24]I can't see it.
[291:37.31]It's a microphone.
[291:43.88]It's gotta be like a fucking water back here or something.
[291:49.80]I'm stuck in the chair.
[291:56.52]Get up and stop moving.
[291:57.68]Alright, whatever.
[292:02.95]I'll tag me in and I'm gonna get the shit out of this guy now.
[292:04.91]Let's go.
[292:12.90]To the right of the chair?
[292:30.15]Stop climbing!
[292:33.55]Oh my god, stop climbing!
[292:39.65]The ref didn't see it.
[292:40.87]The ref didn't see it.
[292:42.51]Okay, okay.
[292:43.59]The ref didn't see it.
[292:51.48]Get in the ring.
[292:54.22]Why are you going in the crowd?
[292:57.76]You're going to lose us the championship if you don't get the fuck in the ring right now.
[293:12.80]I'm still on the ground.
[293:13.62]I'm not getting up anytime soon.
[293:23.51]I think I'm... Okay.
[293:33.82]I am desperately trying to get up here.
[293:42.78]Is there a fight out here?
[293:49.62]I don't know what's happening.
[294:01.25]Machine learning?
[294:02.45]Yeah, it does feel like it.
[294:08.22]I don't know.
[294:10.82]We might lose the championship here.
[294:24.45]Come on Like a fish out of water seriously, you just pulled me out of the ocean like pull me back in the ocean, please I Blame the guy seriously the guy that grabbed me and hit my head on the pavement.
[294:47.33]Oh
[294:48.55]Just fucked me all up.
[294:49.83]And you know what?
[294:52.41]I don't care anymore.
[294:54.85]I don't give a shit.
[294:55.83]I'm hitting this guy.
[294:56.49]I'm going to crush this.
[294:57.93]Okay, never mind.
[294:59.05]Apparently I'm covered in like slippery cooking oil.
[295:04.50]I can't do anything.
[295:08.78]My whole body is covered in vegetable oil.
[295:13.63]Sit in the chair.
[295:14.27]Dude, I would love to just walk up this.
[295:15.99]Okay, there I am.
[295:34.97]That guy was a threat.
[295:42.24]You know what?
[295:43.24]Just tag me in.
[295:44.08]You're obviously fucking useless.
[295:54.36]This guy doesn't understand who we should be fighting.
[295:56.68]They're just walking in a random direction.
[296:00.60]This is really bad for you to tag me in, but you know what?
[296:03.58]I at least have a brain.
[296:12.44]That was a great save, actually.
[296:13.46]Okay.
[296:30.49]Good.
[296:32.65]Okay, yeah, sure.
[296:33.45]Come on in.
[296:37.07]We can do a tag team here.
[296:42.90]Now I'm gonna go sit in the chair.
[296:58.77]I just need 10% of my health.
[297:05.49]Oh my god, we're okay.
[297:07.74]Alright, I have enough health.
[297:13.66]Now I'm not sloppy.
[297:15.84]This should be fine now.
[297:27.30]Good.
[297:32.12]Alright, there we go.
[297:32.94]Now I can actually do moves.
[297:35.60]That's a rope break.
[297:37.38]Put me up.
[297:41.06]Appreciate the help, thank you.
[297:53.66]Let's get that pin.
[297:58.28]Oh, come on.
[298:05.78]Who's drinking?
[298:07.87]You.
[298:08.71]No, give me that.
[298:13.73]Stop drinking it.
[298:14.77]You don't even... What?
[298:20.31]Why?
[298:21.53]Why?
[298:23.29]It's been like 10 straight minutes in this match of all the times for you to do that stupid shit.
[298:38.30]That's gonna be it.
[298:38.80]Goddammit.
[298:48.39]Be careful.
[298:48.93]You're walking into enemy territory.
[298:50.09]Get that.
[298:57.68]Twist that leg.
[299:09.27]Oh my fucking god.
[299:29.36]This guy is unstoppable.
[299:31.61]I can't hurt him.
[299:41.11]Alright, choke him.
[299:46.80]I don't know what's happening, but I think I got it.
[299:51.10]Keep him occupied, and this is it.
[299:52.48]There it is.
[299:56.63]Hell yeah.
[299:59.86]That was some clutch performance by Bobby Hyena.
[300:08.69]Okay.
[300:08.87]I don't know what that was about.
[300:10.55]We can keep our belts.
[300:47.15]Okay, we're good.
[300:48.49]I'm ready to play now.
[300:50.21]Put me in the game now.
[300:52.05]I came here to prove.
[300:52.81]I gotta go.
[300:53.23]Yeah, go after the guy that tried to assassinate you.
[300:55.17]Yep.
[300:55.29]Put me on the stage.
[300:57.03]Bobby Hut.
[300:57.59]I'm ready to rage now.
[300:59.15]I feel like an animal stuck in a cage and I'm ready to break out.
[301:01.98]Change the name back?
[301:02.82]I don't think I can.
[301:03.38]My time.
[301:04.18]My time.
[301:05.10]None of you people can tell me to stop.
[301:06.90]This time like the last time.
[301:19.55]Alright.
[301:20.31]Now I'm very pissed off.
[301:23.05]I'm out for blood now.
[301:29.10]I don't care how much sleep I haven't had.
[301:30.36]I don't care how tired I am.
[301:33.22]Where is he?
[301:35.18]Where is that piece of shit?
[301:40.03]Not here.
[301:40.35]Over the bar.
[301:42.55]I'll find you.
[301:49.30]He's not in there.
[301:50.94]Nope.
[301:51.56]Where are you?
[302:05.10]Hmm.
[302:07.66]Oh no.
[302:19.86]That's all I need.
[302:21.50]I need 20% health, I'll be fine.
[302:29.04]All American Wrestling's proposed TV taping on the second week of September has been canceled.
[302:38.97]Tag team submission?
[302:40.91]Oh, he slept in the street the whole time, okay.
[303:02.01]It's gonna tail him for a sec.
[303:09.18]Hmm.
[303:12.78]You got nothing to say?
[303:16.86]Well... Your doctor's gonna have a lot to say about what happens to your face.
[303:35.61]Yeah, get him, get him!
[303:36.39]This guy's probably been a menace to everybody.
[303:44.23]Excuse me?
[303:49.89]Where is he?
[303:51.79]Get over here.
[303:52.91]I'm more skillful than you, Cesar.
[303:54.81]Don't start something you can't finish.
[303:56.11]I'm putting you in the hospital.
[304:03.60]You're faster than me?
[304:04.38]Wait, do you have a race?
[304:07.03]You better not fucking break my neck.
[304:11.81]Find your own business, Glitter says.
[304:17.01]If you want to be a hero, you'll die like one.
[304:19.05]I'm... No, I got no problem with you.
[304:21.60]My problem is with this guy.
[304:26.72]Alright, you proved your point.
[304:27.72]I don't want any more trouble.
[304:28.62]Well, that'd be nice if... You got a match today?
[304:31.74]Hey, dude.
[304:32.18]Hey, bro.
[304:32.34]You got a match today?
[304:33.86]Get away from me.
[304:42.21]Yeah, dude, I'm just curious if you... Uh-oh.
[304:51.56]Okay, I need to eat.
[304:53.04]Oh my god, I'm at zero health again.
[304:54.26]I actually need to go in the hospital.
[305:02.88]I don't care.
[305:03.44]I could be an hour or two hours late to the match.
[305:04.83]I don't care.
[305:15.90]I can't believe that.
[305:16.66]No, please leave me alone.
[305:18.06]Why am I holding my ass?
[305:22.15]What's wrong?
[305:22.99]What's wrong?
[305:23.67]Do I need to go to the bathroom?
[305:28.44]Shut up.
[305:32.88]No, I can't eat this.
[305:45.79]Okay, hurry up.
[305:47.55]Hurry, hurry.
[305:52.36]I just shit my pants.
[305:53.20]What?
[306:02.86]I can't.
[306:03.72]I can't.
[306:04.34]Are you gonna be kidding me?
[306:05.76]What?
[306:06.90]That's impossible.
[306:07.80]That's not possible.
[306:09.46]That's impossible.
[306:11.33]It's impossible.
[306:12.40]Are you shitting yourself?
[306:13.74]What?
[306:14.10]No.
[306:15.04]Don't believe those rumors.
[306:16.76]Don't believe those rumors.
[306:18.60]That didn't happen.
[306:24.88]Those are disgusting rumors and I will not have them spread anymore.
[306:40.95]Remain the tag team champions this long by ducking me.
[306:47.97]Everybody knows that I'm the biggest threat to that little title you've been up against.
[306:53.62]What is it?
[306:54.06]I'm so confused.
[306:55.86]You can't put it off any longer and now I'll prove why you were right to fear me.
[306:59.10]Alright, weapons are not allowed, obviously.
[307:21.20]Imagine shooting your pants and not even like going and wiping your ass.
[307:25.60]And going right into a ring.
[307:28.10]And doing a wrestling like theatrical routine.
[307:31.18]I didn't even change the pants.
[307:46.65]I'm not doing bad.
[307:47.95]I just have to exchange it.
[307:48.95]You know what I mean?
[307:49.39]Like just...
[307:51.51]Me strong is all about the right-handed exchange.
[307:54.61]In fact, you know what?
[307:56.05]You go in, please.
[307:58.61]Glitter shitter.
[308:00.39]That's fine.
[308:00.69]Any water down here?
[308:01.35]You guys have water?
[308:07.01]That guy chugged a water last time.
[308:10.25]I want it.
[308:10.75]Where is it?
[308:11.09]The other guy that was here chugged a water.
[308:20.91]Please get off.
[308:30.54]There's no water.
[308:41.20]Oh my god, I just, I don't want to climb up.
[308:48.09]Oh fuck it, whatever, there's nothing here!
[309:09.47]God damn it.
[309:15.28]You're doing so good too, actually.
[309:21.45]I'm trying to get out.
[309:22.21]You don't understand.
[309:22.99]Officer, you don't understand.
[309:44.46]Um... Weapons are not allowed.
[309:49.18]I gotta get disqualified.
[309:49.82]I don't care.
[309:57.55]Wait.
[309:57.75]It's not illegal if I do it.
[309:59.87]That's correct, right?
[310:13.85]Oh my god, he didn't see it, did he?
[310:19.94]Thank god, my back!
[310:29.08]I'm getting out, I'm getting out, I'm getting out.
[310:33.03]Here we go.
[310:34.79]Come here.
[310:44.24]Fuck outta here.
[310:51.21]Oh, he's trying to hit the referee.
[311:03.01]Where am I?
[311:08.05]He's...
[311:14.78]No.
[311:15.12]Dude, did shit just pop out?
[311:19.36]I just saw like brown splatters.
[311:30.39]Okay, I think I'm good.
[311:35.91]I am good.
[311:36.39]I'm good.
[311:39.35]There's a bat right here.
[311:40.17]I'm going to use it.
[311:45.83]I'm gonna use it very well.
[312:02.91]Oh shit!
[312:03.59]No, I gotta help my friend!
[312:04.91]I gotta help my friend!
[312:05.69]I gotta help my friend!
[312:27.42]Pin, pin, pin, pin, pin, pin!
[312:37.26]There are more viewers in chat than there are in the whole arena.
[312:41.08]True.
[312:41.30]Alright, I think he's got this in the bag.
[312:50.27]I think... Why am I swaying?
[312:54.95]Oh, now you're fucked.
[312:56.79]Now you're fucked, man.
[312:57.95]Big mistake.
[313:05.13]I'll make sure you have as little HP as I do.
[313:07.03]Alright.
[313:26.73]Alright, tag me in.
[313:29.11]Tag me in, tag me in, tag me in.
[313:32.71]Right here.
[313:43.56]I'm trying to kick him so bad.
[313:47.18]Alright, tag.
[313:49.82]Come on, I'm right here.
[313:52.64]That's illegal.
[313:53.78]What he just did was illegal.
[314:01.53]Tag me in dude, what are you doing?
[314:03.23]Are you alright?
[314:03.73]Is that illegal?
[314:09.96]Oh my god, I think I killed that guy!
[314:11.54]Oh no, that's the ref!
[314:12.99]He's seriously injured!
[314:17.51]He's ser- I seriously injured the ref.
[314:29.05]What do we do?
[314:29.47]What do we do?
[314:29.93]What do we do about this?
[314:31.33]Okay.
[314:31.99]I'm gonna... Break his ankle.
[314:38.18]Break it.
[314:45.72]What?
[314:48.20]Alright.
[314:48.40]Pin this guy.
[314:50.12]I need to pin this guy right now.
[314:52.71]Get out.
[314:52.97]We gotta get out.
[314:54.51]We're both in.
[314:54.93]We're gonna get double disqualified.
[314:56.01]I can't let go.
[315:02.47]No, get out of the ring!
[315:03.35]Get out of the ring!
[315:05.17]What was that sound?
[315:25.00]Get that pin.
[315:29.08]He's writhing on the ground in pain.
[315:33.83]Everyone's bleeding.
[315:35.57]Everyone's bloody.
[315:40.96]This is so fucked up.
[315:52.50]I had to get in.
[315:54.32]I gotta get in the ring.
[315:59.16]I would love to be tagged.
[316:00.30]Oh my god, he hit him in the head with a dumbbell.
[316:02.69]Dude, that was fucked up.
[316:07.47]What?
[316:11.41]He's kicking him out.
[316:13.01]He's kicking this guy out.
[316:14.27]He kicked the... That guy didn't do anything, by the way.
[316:17.69]Graffiti is this guy in the middle.
[316:21.85]There... Oh my god, we're gonna win.
[316:26.67]Why did he throw... This guy's been throwing...
[316:36.02]Oh my god, this fucking scientist over here is just cosplaying as us.
[316:39.50]He's wearing our belts.
[316:41.58]He threw the wrong guy out.
[316:53.09]Hit!
[317:00.04]No, no, no.
[317:00.38]I gotta let this play out.
[317:01.12]This is bad.
[317:01.58]I don't want to just go off on myself.
[317:06.39]Come tag me in.
[317:10.82]I would love you to tag me in.
[317:17.74]Come tag me in, please.
[317:19.00]You've been in for so long.
[317:27.37]Tag me in.
[317:28.75]So I can finish this once and for all.
[317:37.76]I'm not your teammate.
[317:39.28]I think you might be hallucinating.
[317:41.04]Is the ref okay?
[318:01.47]Oh my goodness.
[318:04.19]You need to tag me in.
[318:08.75]Why won't he tag... Just tag my ass in, please!
[318:18.44]Tag!
[318:21.18]What do I have to do to get you to tag me in?
[318:28.51]If you get pinned, I swear to God, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you in the parking lot.
[318:42.46]I'll do it myself.
[318:57.89]Doctor!
[318:59.41]You just blew it.
[319:01.72]So bad.
[319:14.77]Hit it.
[319:20.98]Don't fucking do that shit again.
[319:34.87]Give our bell back.
[319:38.27]Oh, don't forget this guy.
[319:39.17]The sister who watches the game.
[319:54.70]Why did he do that?
[319:56.46]I hope the ref is okay.
[320:00.53]I did not do that.
[320:01.41]Let's be honest.
[320:02.03]Litter says he was upset that he was barely involved in that match.
[320:23.31]Errol Hathaway severely injured his shoulder in that match and will be unable to wrestle for the next two weeks.
[320:29.14]He may be a shadow of his former self.
[320:50.17]I'm not the guy that threw a barbell at his head.
[320:54.29]I picked him up and I gently placed him over the ropes onto the ground below.
[320:59.71]I didn't throw a bunch of shit at him.
[321:03.08]I didn't throw a heavy, dangerous barbell at his head.
[321:05.44]I did not do that.
[321:20.36]You had fun out there, Cesar, but you made quite a mess of the arena.
[321:23.30]If you ever want to book this venue again, you better pay $300.
[321:29.17]That's fine.
[321:49.92]Alright, somebody's fighting.
[321:50.89]I heard a punch.
[322:01.34]Um... Okay.
[322:03.94]I'm not jo- I've not had more than 10% health in like an hour and a half game time.
[322:29.43]Oh my god, a full night's sleep finally.
[322:40.26]Okay.
[322:43.08]Why do I have a feud?
[322:46.16]Perfect Sean is coming down with an illness and is in poor health.
[322:52.09]Fans insist on treating Glitter Cesar as a heel despite his attempts to play face.
[323:01.71]Eight Man War.
[323:03.96]Versus High Notes Team.
[323:06.68]Eight Man War?
[323:07.56]Okay.
[323:10.88]Alright, I want some food, I want some drink.
[323:25.97]You should get the fans on your side to be more popular.
[323:35.83]I already was a face.
[323:37.29]Yeah, I want to be face.
[323:40.59]Okay, let's start portraying you in a positive light.
[323:42.65]The fans will appreciate a chance to get behind you.
[323:44.33]How is high note alive?
[323:50.51]I don't know.
[323:56.25]Okay, this drops your HP.
[323:58.07]I want the pizza.
[324:03.15]I would love for someone to explain what happened.
[324:06.85]I tried to pick the pizza up and I fucking jumped off and hurt myself.
[324:12.55]Is this money on the ground?
[324:14.62]Ah, yep.
[324:15.02]I'll take 300 bucks.
[324:19.46]I did the same thing, right?
[324:20.58]Okay.
[324:29.49]Food.
[324:29.79]I'm gonna just drink the stuff on the ground.
[324:43.29]I love how this costs money.
[324:53.31]Alright, I'm good.
[324:57.28]Wait.
[324:57.78]Okay.
[325:05.36]Now I'm ready.
[325:12.59]Get out of here.
[325:21.63]I want his shower.
[325:25.45]Do not sleep through your match.
[325:27.35]I want... Oh my... You fucking idiot.
[325:55.26]Here's our team.
[325:59.98]I'm late for school.
[326:07.04]This belt is glued to my body.
[326:08.62]I have not taken this off.
[326:09.72]Listen up, everybody.
[326:13.36]There's something I need to get off my chest before we go any further.
[326:15.56]Did you just bite me?
[326:20.52]I know I've been a jerk in recent times.
[326:22.60]I've said and done some things that I'm not proud of.
[326:28.46]But I realize we're nothing without the support of the fans.
[326:31.04]You're the electricity that gives us life.
[326:36.17]With your help, I know I can be a better wrestler.
[326:38.05]I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential.
[326:44.19]Hey, we done with the life-changing crap?
[326:45.81]The only drama that matters is in the ring.
[326:58.35]No, I don't want to give you that.
[326:59.31]I want this money.
[327:00.35]This is my money.
[327:02.51]No, I want this money.
[327:04.89]How do I put the... I want to pocket this money.
[327:06.58]How do you pocket the money?
[327:11.82]I'm trying to pocket this money.
[327:14.00]If I can't have it, nobody can.
[327:17.26]Wait, is everything legal?
[327:21.17]It is.
[327:22.55]This is going to be a mess.
[327:29.31]Um... Okay.
[327:38.15]Get... That high note?
[327:55.60]It is.
[328:07.12]Dynamite?
[328:14.92]Why is there dynamite?
[328:23.60]Why did it explode?
[328:28.65]How did it explode?
[328:38.52]I came out with some people and I don't remember who they are, so everyone's an enemy.
[328:43.83]Oh, the misery.
[328:53.23]You can set things on fire by holding taunt and then pressing the pickup key.
[329:02.37]What?
[329:07.83]Alright, time for just absolutely no remorse.
[329:19.39]There's too many people in the ring.
[329:20.63]We can't... I don't think there's a pin.
[329:24.00]I think you just have to knock the people out.
[329:36.02]Excuse me?
[329:37.82]There are pins.
[329:40.64]And how do you expect for any single person to get pinned here?
[329:58.27]Whose belt is this guy wearing?
[329:59.49]I don't think this is possible.
[330:06.49]I might leave.
[330:12.33]There's no rope breaks either.
[330:19.20]Who's winning?
[330:19.90]I... Aftershock got eliminated.
[330:24.16]I need the chair.
[330:32.49]I need something dangerous.
[330:46.43]Get up.
[330:52.63]Pin this guy.
[330:55.86]He's a teammate.
[331:01.78]You gotta be shitting me, dude.
[331:03.54]No way.
[331:08.12]Submit.
[331:21.13]Okay, I think Harley is on my team.
[331:23.11]That guy brought money into the ring.
[331:39.22]Yeah, she is.
[331:46.47]I might just walk out of the arena.
[331:50.10]I don't think this is a title match.
[332:00.05]I'm just gonna be artillery.
[332:25.44]Alright, pin, pin, pin somebody!
[332:26.55]Am I pinning someone?
[332:43.90]Burn items by holding taunt then pressing the pickup button.
[332:55.90]Guy off me.
[333:00.68]Save the ref.
[333:01.32]There is no ref.
[333:03.66]Okay.
[333:05.51]Taunt.
[333:06.33]Pick up.
[333:06.63]Hold taunt.
[333:09.39]Pick up item.
[333:09.87]I don't think that did anything.
[333:20.91]Is that my guy?
[333:21.50]Alright.
[333:23.22]Break his ankle.
[333:23.68]Good.
[333:34.74]Judgment Dave eliminated?
[333:38.16]Excuse me, don't pin me.
[333:55.11]You gotta be shitting me.
[333:58.17]We're gonna lose!
[334:04.31]This is just absolute mayhem.
[334:06.47]Like, I don't even know what's going on.
[334:20.04]If falls count anywhere, I need to bring somebody outside.
[334:36.44]That's got to be it.
[334:37.98]Thank God.
[334:38.48]Alright.
[334:39.44]I think it's even now.
[334:53.32]It only works if it's flammable.
[334:58.40]Can we get this guy out?
[334:59.50]Because that's... He's...
[335:11.10]That's 21 good really could have lost that one Yeah, um get out please these guys shouldn't be into that both still in here This is horseshit
[335:38.36]Alright, well now the last one here.
[335:39.58]Let's make sure that he doesn't... Okay.
[335:45.30]Please.
[335:55.01]That's it.
[335:55.29]Apparently it's not.
[335:58.87]Now it is.
[336:04.84]Somebody... You flipped the camera on fire.
[336:10.38]Get this.
[336:10.68]You gotta get this on camera.
[336:13.10]Hell yeah.
[336:19.23]Too excited.
[336:20.43]Too big of a hug.
[336:21.61]Too excited.
[336:22.27]I know it can get confusing sometimes, Harley, but...
[336:38.97]I mean I want this I want that 20 Okay, I think we're doing fine
[337:09.71]Being hindered, but I got more agility, that's fine.
[337:17.43]iTide is disappointed that his client lost that match.
[337:20.65]Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[337:39.18]Alright.
[337:39.98]Good match.
[337:42.16]I want to challenge the person for the World Championship.
[337:44.22]I don't know who it is.
[337:44.80]It may have been an accident, but Errol halfway got hurt because of you.
[337:53.39]Before this situation caused any more pain, you better pay him $900 in compensation.
[338:01.91]Get the fuck out of here.
[338:05.17]What are you talking about?
[338:05.71]What the fuck are you saying?
[338:07.59]I didn't fucking do anything.
[338:09.43]That's not my problem.
[338:10.11]I didn't fucking do anything.
[338:13.09]I didn't mean to put all the blame on you.
[338:14.41]I suppose Errol needs to take responsibility.
[338:16.99]I didn't fucking do anything.
[338:24.62]We won that match thanks to me.
[338:26.32]Never forget that.
[338:28.80]True.
[338:48.00]You don't look so good.
[338:50.10]You alright?
[338:55.24]This guy's got zero HP.
[339:01.43]Bro, there ain't nothing in here.
[339:03.59]Give me that back.
[339:04.97]No take backs.
[339:05.71]Are you serious?
[339:06.51]No.
[339:06.81]Get out of here.
[339:08.94]Get.
[339:09.82]Excuse me.
[339:26.86]I want that.
[339:27.24]Did I get it?
[339:28.90]Give me that.
[339:33.59]Holy shit, that was a nightmare.
[339:36.89]Oh my god, wait a minute, give me this.
[339:38.13]He's sleeping.
[339:41.13]This guy always has a sledgehammer.
[339:45.92]You know what?
[339:46.54]Nobody's gonna have it.
[339:57.59]Give me back that hammer!
[339:58.57]I'll show you what it's- Alright, I need it for one second.
[340:01.81]I'll give it right back.
[340:03.73]I promise I'll give it right back.
[340:10.77]That's fine.
[340:11.23]I'll give it right back.
[340:12.11]Aww.
[340:18.98]I was gonna hit this guy in the face with it.
[340:20.68]But now it's just down- That's- Whatever.
[340:34.26]That's what a champion does.
[340:36.74]Celebration.
[340:41.46]Why is there another hammer?
[340:49.51]What's the match for?
[341:04.69]Confrontation versus Jester at 8 p.m.
[341:07.19]You got it Did I lose the hammers I Didn't I didn't do I just literally pressed the left on the analog What is wrong with this guy?
[341:33.55]Oh, thank God.
[341:34.07]My hammers are still there.
[341:38.69]Oh, fuck.
[341:52.64]I've been playing way too much Elden Ring.
[341:54.10]I just tried to press Y and R1 to put this in two hands.
[342:01.23]Wait, can I take two hammers?
[342:03.13]I don't think so.
[342:05.28]Can you?
[342:05.90]Wait, maybe I can.
[342:15.81]Oh my goodness.
[342:16.81]Are you kidding me?
[342:32.26]Where's the pain in the ass?
[342:47.54]I can't double hammer.
[342:48.54]I'm sorry.
[342:50.68]Okay.
[342:52.88]Um... Okay, well, I'm gonna...
[343:03.81]No, pick up the hammer.
[343:16.36]Alright, Glitter Scissor.
[343:18.34]What do you want, Doink?
[343:35.88]What's this about?
[343:36.38]Hey, glitter.
[343:40.34]When you mess with my friends and you answer to me.
[343:47.57]I know it happens to be a friend of mine and I don't appreciate what you did to him.
[343:54.79]I know God what he was coming to him, man.
[343:56.55]Don't worry.
[343:57.15]I got plenty left for you, you fucking idiot.
[343:59.99]Okay, kid.
[344:24.99]Don't let him take the belt.
[344:26.16]That's disrespect.
[344:41.55]Where did the hammer go?
[344:48.15]Oh, nobody touches my fucking hammers.
[344:49.70]Oh my god, he got it.
[344:53.94]Nobody touches my fucking hammers.
[344:59.14]I threw it into the crowd?
[345:08.72]Holy shit, he's still standing.
[345:18.05]Okay, I kinda want this guy on my team.
[345:33.54]Is this face behavior?
[345:40.72]The game wants me to take his health to zero.
[345:44.18]I'm just doing it in a very efficient way.
[345:47.26]I'm... The game is like, hey, take this guy's health to zero.
[346:17.27]Where's... He's hiding in the crowd.
[346:32.11]Oh, man.
[346:32.69]He's... You want to go?
[346:34.40]Fine.
[346:36.64]Hammer V. Hammer in the ring right now.
[346:40.32]You want to do it?
[346:40.82]That's fine.
[346:42.14]Sure.
[347:08.34]A nice big hug.
[347:12.44]Um... I want my hammers back.
[347:14.48]Those are valuable.
[347:17.84]Where's the other one?
[347:25.78]Okay, there's one and there's two.
[347:27.57]Alright, I'm good.
[348:02.23]He came out and yelled at me.
[348:04.53]And he said he was going to kill me.
[348:06.09]Ooh, we're almost there.
[348:11.03]Almost number one.
[348:16.74]How many runes did you get?
[348:17.80]Alright, I want a championship.
[348:26.84]We've had the tag championships for like two hours.
[348:31.50]I want the real prize.
[348:35.34]Holy shit.
[348:41.57]Alright, Lance Monaco, you own this league, but... I didn't... I honestly didn't do... I just... Oh, I don't... If I pick up that other hammer, I swear to God, it's over for everybody.
[348:58.74]I had my hammers in my hand, too.
[349:00.98]Okay.
[349:01.22]Where's the other one?
[349:04.60]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[349:08.16]Who did that?
[349:12.93]You know, I've deserved it.
[349:15.37]I deserved it.
[349:18.69]That's retaliation for all the dumb shit I've been doing, so I get it.
[349:27.32]Anyway, that doesn't mean I'm gonna let that fly, though.
[349:30.27]You know what I'm saying?
[349:42.97]Oh shit, I think my neck hurts.
[349:52.98]There's too many bodies in the way, I need... Alright, I'm out, I'm out, I'm done.
[350:00.50]This guy in the red shirt, I don't know what you're doing.
[350:15.54]That's your boss?
[350:17.26]He jumped on me and started hitting me in the head with a wrench.
[350:21.74]Hey, you got a title.
[350:22.52]Can we talk?
[350:26.82]I want a challenge to the championship.
[350:33.78]Give me a title shot.
[350:34.68]Title shot.
[350:42.05]Come here.
[350:47.30]Get away from me.
[350:48.52]Oh my god.
[350:57.57]Thanks for this hammer.
[350:58.87]I know what I'm gonna do with it.
[351:00.29]No, that's not yours.
[351:01.27]Wait, can I have a title match?
[351:17.26]Hey look, Errol has recovered from his injury and looks forward to getting back to work.
[351:20.84]Have you ever heard of a wrestler called Tate Madison from Weekend Warriors?
[351:31.43]No?
[351:34.17]I think we could do the gimmick better, so how would you like to be our version of him?
[351:43.61]What hap- What happened to the- Did I change my hair again?
[351:50.17]Why do I look fatter than ever?
[351:51.29]I'm not imitating anybody.
[351:55.47]I should have signed the real Tate Madison instead of you.
[352:02.39]Here's the champ.
[352:04.55]Perfect, Sean.
[352:18.10]What do you want, Glitter, says her.
[352:19.40]This better be worth my time.
[352:26.32]I challenge you to a match.
[352:30.00]I'm busy on the fourth week of September.
[352:31.52]Let's talk about this some other time.
[352:34.14]Fine.
[352:37.16]For you.
[352:44.70]Challenge you to a match.
[352:50.76]There wouldn't be any chemistry between us so long as we're both faces.
[352:54.76]That's not what I asked.
[352:56.52]I said I want to fight you for your belt.
[352:58.55]Heavyweight championship.
[353:05.77]Okay.
[353:07.95]I got no show.
[353:09.20]That means I can probably just do whatever I want.
[353:16.90]Anything else to talk about?
[353:40.61]Alright, time to take a shower.
[353:45.14]Ah, okay.
[353:45.62]There we go.
[353:50.36]Much better.
[353:59.68]Weird way to take a shower.
[354:10.83]But would you be willing to sell that table leg for $10?
[354:14.11]Sure.
[354:14.41]Sure.
[354:17.33]I'm glad you're doing business with you.
[354:44.69]You serious?
[354:52.02]Get out of here!
[354:53.44]Fine, you can have it.
[354:54.24]Take it.
[354:54.98]You can have it.
[355:31.04]I light the gun on fire?
[355:44.19]I'm such a little shit.
[355:50.05]Oh no, is he alright?
[355:56.30]You guys been fighting in here the whole time?
[356:12.81]This is what I do on my day off, really.
[356:19.02]Like, bam bam.
[356:44.91]Okay.
[356:48.40]So, wait, there's no matches going on?
[356:49.76]So what's out here?
[356:50.44]What's going on outside?
[356:51.50]Oh, there really is nothing going on.
[356:58.62]Can I sleep in the ring?
[357:17.15]Go check the subway out.
[357:18.67]That's a good idea.
[357:28.99]What happened?
[357:33.59]What was that?
[357:34.01]You want to talk?
[357:43.22]I mean, I'm just... There's no show or anything going on here.
[357:46.56]Not today.
[357:49.55]You know you can maintain your grip after a move by holding attack or grapple?
[357:58.21]Actually, really good tip.
[358:02.13]We should work together.
[358:02.75]Alright, I'll go to the subway.
[358:15.96]I ain't going without some type of protection.
[358:33.39]How are you?
[358:37.56]Nothing to say?
[358:38.08]Pyroids.
[358:53.65]Where do I get them?
[358:58.96]No, you cannot get hit by the train.
[359:09.21]Where does this go?
[359:18.39]How you doing?
[359:18.77]This is the boss's son.
[359:33.56]Oh, okay.
[359:43.79]Anybody else on the train?
[359:44.39]I don't think there's anything else for me to do.
[360:06.23]Why is it so scary?
[360:09.01]It's kind of scary, isn't it?
[360:10.53]Weird.
[360:22.42]What else is down here?
[360:23.12]Hmm.
[360:36.62]There are more places to have random fights.
[360:38.82]I gotta go to bed.
[360:39.34]Okay, go to the plane.
[360:46.11]Yeah, I'm not fucking around on the plane.
[361:00.96]It really is Silent Hill.
[361:02.70]So what's on the card now?
[361:04.99]Uh oh.
[361:05.55]Confrontation with Errol Hathaway?
[361:29.82]This is the guy that I threw over the top rope and hurt.
[361:34.35]This is the ref.
[361:43.99]Definitely taking the hammer.
[361:47.04]Without a doubt.
[361:50.56]This game is insane.
[361:52.26]Wish you luck in your match tonight.
[361:54.78]Is it a match?
[361:55.42]Why would I fight a referee?
[361:59.42]Dangerous things happened back here, and it would be a shame if you ended up crawling to the ring.
[362:04.76]I would choose your words more carefully.
[362:09.99]God.
[362:10.41]1,200 bucks.
[362:13.27]Look at your health.
[362:13.77]I think I'm bluffing.
[362:18.68]When I'm finished with you, the only place you'll be going is intensive care.
[362:22.50]Interesting, because that's exactly what I was going to just say to you.
[362:40.59]It's almost time for our match!
[362:47.31]We're gonna go hear what the referee has to say.
[362:48.73]Have you ever worked with a wrestler called Matty McFly here at All American Wrestling?
[363:05.42]His contract is up for renewal soon, so we'd be interested to know if you have any feedback.
[363:14.96]Um, Matty McFly was alright.
[363:17.08]I liked him.
[363:20.10]I'd be pleased to hear that.
[363:21.00]We'll do our best to keep him.
[363:23.74]Wasn't he a nice guy?
[363:24.40]I thought he was nice to me.
[363:28.45]Was he not nice?
[363:36.09]Why is everybody following me?
[363:39.31]What are you doing?
[363:40.07]What the fuck are you doing?
[363:40.96]Wait, get out!
[363:41.54]Excuse me!
[363:42.10]What are you doing?
[363:42.70]Leave me alone!
[363:44.79]Dude, I don't want to hit you with this, but I'm gonna... You're telling me to calm down.
[363:54.85]You are the aggressor right now.
[363:58.39]I am not doing anything.
[363:59.39]I'm waiting to go on stage for my match.
[364:05.23]Oh no, the tables have turned.
[364:06.25]Everybody's...
[364:22.02]Alright, almost done.
[364:31.27]When is our match?
[364:31.89]Come on.
[364:38.45]Ready.
[364:39.47]Where is he?
[364:46.31]Where is he?
[364:46.91]Where is he?
[364:47.19]Where is he?
[364:53.54]Oh, it's you.
[364:54.02]I wasn't sure if I would ever step between these ropes again after I got injured.
[365:00.80]Thanks to the support of my fans, I'm back better than ever.
[365:03.02]You can break my bones, but you can never break my spirit.
[365:08.73]Do you think any of these people are glad that you're back or even notice that you were gone?
[365:12.31]Don't get too comfortable, Errol Hathaway, because I'm going to send you right back to intensive care.
[365:21.41]I'm not a face at all.
[365:25.19]I really don't want to do this, but I think the story is... Okay.
[365:32.59]Well, now you put our belt on.
[365:35.13]That's like the most... That is absolute trash, what you've just done.
[365:40.35]There's no remorse for what I'm... You take the belt off and put it on?
[365:44.51]My buddy Hyena is going to show you a thing or two.
[365:50.17]What is that about?
[365:50.80]About respect, for God's sakes.
[366:07.33]hurt him again.
[366:09.95]I don't want to hurt him again.
[366:11.15]I'm thinking about walking out.
[366:26.98]Oh, my mouth!
[366:27.81]My lip!
[366:29.89]Okay, I've had enough.
[366:30.85]Okay, that's enough.
[366:37.21]Okay, I'm literally out of here.
[366:38.77]I don't want to do this.
[366:39.51]I don't want to fucking kill this guy.
[366:46.42]Okay, that's enough.
[366:49.24]That's enough.
[366:50.84]Right?
[366:51.18]That's enough.
[366:57.53]Okay, that's enough.
[366:58.13]I like jumped on him.
[367:10.77]No, you guys are crazy.
[367:12.73]I don't want to do... Listen to you guys.
[367:17.81]Listen to you guys.
[367:19.29]I don't want to do that.
[367:20.01]I'm not going to hurt him.
[367:21.50]I'm just going to take his health to zero.
[367:23.30]Look at his face.
[367:26.84]On like the concrete.
[367:28.90]This poor guy.
[367:29.66]This is not alright.
[367:32.48]I don't like this at all.
[367:34.52]This doesn't feel good.
[367:35.58]This feels bad.
[367:36.35]He's a referee for God's sakes.
[367:49.91]He's a cocky referee.
[368:01.28]Okay, he's done.
[368:06.29]Do not put your foot down.
[368:08.19]Do not.
[368:09.25]Oh, my God.
[368:11.69]Oh, my God.
[368:12.47]Oh, my God.
[368:13.71]Get me out.
[368:20.14]I thought if I held it I could... Guys, I didn't mean to do that.
[368:22.22]I've done so many terrible things today accidentally.
[368:23.80]Like, I didn't actually want to do that to this guy.
[368:26.70]So many things have happened on this stream I didn't want to do.
[368:44.30]How did you do that by accident?
[368:45.44]By- I was gonna kick him in his like leg, but he lifted his foot up right- Oh man, that's not good.
[368:52.19]Caught in 4k.
[369:02.97]You're awful.
[369:03.65]No, I swear to god I'm not.
[369:05.12]I'm not.
[369:07.54]I swear.
[369:08.22]I don't, I didn't mean to do that.
[369:11.08]I would never do it.
[369:12.24]I would, I wanted to, like, let him leave.
[369:13.68]I didn't want to hurt him.
[369:15.58]I don't want to hurt anybody, okay?
[369:17.92]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[369:19.00]No one.
[369:19.66]I'm not hurting anybody.
[369:22.05]See?
[369:22.33]Look at this.
[369:23.39]Look at this violence over here.
[369:25.47]Look at this violence.
[369:26.85]I didn't do this.
[369:28.13]They did.
[369:28.81]And I'm just walking through.
[369:30.05]Look, I'm just walking through.
[369:40.31]I'm going to my hotel room, and I'm gonna go to bed.
[369:45.99]Who the fuck are you?
[369:46.61]What are you doing in my hotel room?
[369:55.23]We good?
[369:57.71]Are we good?
[369:59.33]Are we good?
[370:00.71]We good?
[370:02.51]We good?
[370:11.01]Okay, sorry.
[370:11.47]You can have it back.
[370:17.39]Right.
[370:18.77]Okay.
[370:19.49]This guy's on crack.
[370:20.46]This guy's on drugs.
[370:25.40]I came in here with that hammer.
[370:35.56]Okay.
[370:42.32]You stole it from him moments ago.
[370:43.82]I did not.
[370:44.34]I can't believe.
[370:48.56]Poor Errol Hathaway.
[370:50.22]I want to go apologize to him.
[371:11.23]You can change your name in the gimmick menu.
[371:13.79]That's kind of funny though.
[371:14.57]Strong new.
[371:42.73]We're a new man.
[371:43.71]New strong.
[371:58.88]Starting over a new leaf.
[372:02.32]Positivity.
[372:03.98]No violence.
[372:05.64]No kicking anybody.
[372:06.74]No hitting somebody in the head with a hammer.
[372:07.90]None of that.
[372:11.94]I'm gonna help people.
[372:17.42]I want a good song.
[372:18.32]One that's, like, uplifting.
[372:27.97]Here we go.
[372:28.51]No.
[372:36.89]Alright.
[373:01.75]Nothing bad.
[373:02.69]I'm going to be kind to everyone I come across.
[373:05.74]I promise.
[373:06.16]Addie Bigfly!
[373:10.92]I put a good word in for you.
[373:13.52]See?
[373:14.04]Good start.
[373:15.36]Something you want to say?
[373:16.20]Yeah.
[373:17.44]I put a good word in for you.
[373:21.94]I have a proposal for you.
[373:30.91]I'd like to work with you.
[373:33.35]Um, I already have a tag team partner, but I've challenged you to a friendly match.
[373:39.81]Oh, no.
[373:49.14]No.
[373:50.76]I got it out of my system.
[373:53.88]I'm fine.
[373:58.37]We are defending the championships today.
[374:02.43]What's up?
[374:04.94]Can I just shake people's hands?
[374:10.45]I'm not gonna pick up any weapons?
[374:11.43]I hear you changed your entrance theme, StrongNu.
[374:14.95]It sounds terrible.
[374:18.51]Well, I mean, we have different opinions.
[374:22.84]We might have two completely distinct thoughts.
[374:25.56]But that does not mean that my opinion is invalid and yours is invalid.
[374:29.42]We both feel different things.
[374:30.56]You know, we come from different places.
[374:32.80]We may have different tastes.
[374:34.66]And I respect that for you.
[374:35.86]I respect that.
[374:38.50]Have a great day.
[374:39.62]Have a great day.
[374:40.06]I'm keeping an eye on your progress.
[374:42.94]I think some changes need to be made.
[374:48.52]Nine matches without losing is quite a streak, but you're making everybody else look bad.
[374:56.27]Put someone over by the fourth week of October to prove that you care about this business.
[375:06.62]Okay.
[375:07.80]You know, I want to make sure that the fellow wrestlers all have a good chance and everybody thinks that they're doing a very good job.
[375:16.92]Someone over.
[375:17.76]Exactly.
[375:18.26]Yeah.
[375:18.72]I'm gonna make sure that I lose a match because we want to make sure everyone feels pretty good about it, right?
[375:30.32]Of course I want to support everybody.
[375:32.06]Of course I do.
[375:32.86]Oh, ow.
[375:33.60]That hurt.
[375:34.12]I deserved it, though.
[375:37.16]Ow, my shin.
[375:37.68]That hurt.
[375:39.12]I must have said something.
[375:40.64]Like, annoying.
[375:43.17]Everybody's getting fucking beat up!
[375:50.46]Mind your own business.
[375:56.30]You want to take a fall?
[375:57.82]Where is he?
[375:59.85]Oh, I must have said something that you didn't like.
[376:01.37]Oh, you want me to take a fall, Lance?
[376:03.47]You want me to take a fall?
[376:04.67]Is that what it is?
[376:06.85]How's that for a fall?
[376:10.99]I'm more popular than you, strong dude.
[376:12.84]Don't start something you can't finish.
[376:14.52]Oh, yeah.
[376:15.30]Must have said something that annoyed you, right?
[376:17.98]Yeah?
[376:30.98]Holy shit.
[376:35.00]I have a match.
[376:39.71]I'm knocked out.
[376:41.25]I think I'm knocked out.
[376:45.77]I can't walk.
[376:50.71]No, wrong way.
[377:03.60]Classic glitter shitter.
[377:04.82]No, I'm gonna be a good person.
[377:34.03]You're a long way from home, Congo.
[377:35.99]You should have stayed at Maple Leaf Grappling.
[377:39.85]I've gotten fatter.
[377:42.19]You may have big fish in that small pond, but all American wrestling is tough for a loser like you.
[377:46.11]I'm not saying this.
[377:49.35]This is my yard.
[377:50.03]These are my fans.
[377:50.87]Nobody carves out a successful career here without my blessing.
[377:53.47]I don't even have a championship.
[377:57.29]It's strange because I recall... Ow!
[377:59.39]Ow!
[378:01.93]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[378:04.15]Sorry.
[378:05.53]My face.
[378:08.35]I'm trying to be like a pacifist.
[378:37.19]I didn't know that was a title match.
[378:41.25]Oh, everybody hates us now.
[378:42.49]I don't know.
[378:56.98]I like the new era of I'm trying to be like a nice person.
[379:03.52]Now I'm getting the championship and I'm going to be a nice person.
[379:08.87]I'm not going to talk shit.
[379:09.91]I'm not going to say anything that's going to make somebody want to punch me in the face.
[379:13.71]Like, I've walked up to people and said, like, oh, hey, you're a fucking loser.
[379:17.03]And then they punch me in the face, right?
[379:18.89]I've hit people and they've hit me back.
[379:20.88]That era is over.
[379:22.66]I'm not going to be an idiot.
[379:23.90]I'm not going to be stupid.
[379:24.88]I'm actually going to try.
[379:26.64]Go talk to the boss.
[379:33.02]That's right.
[379:33.62]I was supposed to do that.
[379:40.42]Where's the boss?
[379:48.50]I was supposed to do that.
[379:49.64]I was supposed to throw.
[380:02.29]What?
[380:05.07]Why can I not go in there?
[380:07.67]Wait for the mission to end.
[380:08.45]Probably the next day.
[380:16.16]Who's on the floor?
[380:16.68]I think that's Maddie McFly.
[380:18.02]Maybe bailing doesn't count as a dive.
[380:37.76]Really?
[380:38.04]I feel like it should.
[380:46.04]I might be in the office.
[380:47.10]I've been challenged to put someone over.
[380:49.40]Oh my god, I didn't... Shit.
[380:50.40]Didn't count.
[380:51.06]No, it didn't count.
[381:16.08]Alright.
[381:17.30]Wait, maybe it did.
[381:17.81]Oh, it did.
[381:18.87]Okay.
[381:20.43]You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever.
[381:22.37]$1,000 bonus.
[381:25.71]That's not worth the titles.
[381:28.53]Sorry.
[381:28.85]Hey, do you know who stole my clothes?
[381:33.47]I can't go out there looking like this.
[381:40.27]Would you be willing to sell me your gear if I paid you $790? $790.
[381:46.17]It's funny you say that.
[381:52.03]Sure, for $790, I will give you the pair of underwear that I shit in.
[382:00.96]You just saved my life.
[382:02.22]Hope I can do the same for you sometime.
[382:06.30]What a deal.
[382:07.96]This is a steel cage match.
[382:15.99]Strongnu, how would you like to take me on in a match on the second week of October?
[382:24.20]I think I'm already booked.
[382:26.24]I think I'm already booked.
[382:28.74]It's a shame.
[382:29.20]I hope we get a chance to work together somewhere.
[382:31.10]I have a match tomorrow, don't I?
[382:51.38]I don't I didn't I didn't press anything Landed on my head Good morning.
[383:07.42]Good morning.
[383:08.10]Good morning to you all good morning.
[383:10.24]Good morning I'm gonna take a fall
[383:15.29]It's such a wonderful world we live in, in this nice street.
[383:21.67]What did the person say?
[383:28.70]Good morning.
[383:31.00]You're booked in a steel cage tag team match.
[383:32.73]Do you need to explain the rules?
[383:34.93]No, I don't.
[383:35.63]But I would absolutely love to clean here.
[383:48.35]Nice Monty Python.
[384:05.54]I think I'm fine on health.
[384:11.42]The amount of people that said stop.
[384:13.04]You know what my favorite thing is?
[384:16.02]I don't know.
[384:16.38]I think it's so fun just to have... What am I doing?
[384:19.03]I'm just kind of waiting for the... I will have the urge to hit somebody with this brum.
[384:24.71]I'm just wandering around.
[384:25.61]Until the match.
[384:33.28]If I stand still for more than an hour, I'm gonna hit somebody with this.
[384:40.94]You think it's fun to be annoying?
[384:46.75]No, I wouldn't say annoying.
[384:47.65]It's fun to be really annoying.
[385:00.76]I don't want to hit this guy, but I'm gonna.
[385:05.98]Leave me alone.
[385:11.22]I'm just kidding around, man.
[385:18.20]Why is a ref climbing this?
[385:19.34]Alright, if he falls, it doesn't count that I didn't hurt him.
[385:39.14]I remember what it's like to be the tag team champion.
[385:41.21]Yeah, because we just were.
[385:42.79]I also felt something was a ref doing.
[385:51.39]Wait, is this for the championship?
[385:59.86]He needs to be in here.
[386:01.24]Doesn't he?
[386:04.94]You're a loser.
[386:07.96]Doesn't the referee need to be in here?
[386:09.62]I can't... I don't think I can use the broom.
[386:19.45]I want to shake it so the referee falls The whole goal is to climb out of the ring, right?
[386:30.01]I think this guy tapped out This guy's tapped out like three times Okay, who is actually
[386:50.01]You climb out of the ring, right?
[386:55.48]What is going on?
[387:01.82]Don't you climb out?
[387:02.90]I thought it was the other way to escape.
[387:18.81]Oh, it's just we're in the... It's just a pin.
[387:20.55]Okay.
[387:27.41]I just thought... I'm sorry.
[387:31.90]I just thought of the Good Morning song.
[387:47.38]I deserve to get called out for that one.
[387:49.10]It was awful.
[387:58.91]Please don't kill me.
[387:59.77]Alright, the teammate disappeared.
[388:21.09]Is this to get the belts back?
[388:23.35]How do I actually get the... The tag team championship is fine.
[388:29.47]But I want to do the belt.
[388:30.41]I want the world championship.
[388:34.61]That's not it, right?
[388:39.47]The theater kid's singing voice.
[388:45.67]I hope you guys understand that I'm just fucking around 95% of the time, right?
[389:02.57]I'm just fucking around.
[389:03.56]I'm just messing around.
[389:05.52]You are a theater kid.
[389:06.36]I mean, I'm a theater adult.
[389:17.55]Which is way worse.
[389:22.29]Who's won the tag team back?
[389:34.03]Best part is the referee has to do this too.
[389:42.88]Dude, I'm never getting out of here, I don't think.
[390:08.13]Get me out of here.
[390:17.84]So we won the tag team again.
[390:20.14]Only soulless zoomers hate new metal wrestling.
[390:49.74]Congratulations on winning the tag team.
[390:51.48]The gold is where it belongs now.
[390:53.10]Oh, thanks, Harley.
[390:53.70]I appreciate it.
[390:54.44]That was cool.
[390:59.25]Alright.
[390:59.53]Can we make a... I'm curious what's going on.
[391:04.95]You're still here, but what's going on out here now?
[391:13.70]There's a fight going on.
[391:20.91]Everybody stop?
[391:21.53]What?
[391:21.85]Is it weird that I came in here?
[391:45.13]Okay.
[391:45.71]Alright, alright, I'm leaving.
[391:46.67]I'm gonna leave.
[391:49.27]Alright, I'm leaving!
[391:50.09]This is chaos.
[392:12.65]Just, no, I don't have nobody I'm attacking.
[392:15.47]I'm just, I'm just K. I don't want to say that word.
[392:21.69]I'm chaos because it's like, come on, dude.
[392:25.97]Relax.
[392:28.24]I am chaos.
[392:32.42]Oh, my knee.
[392:46.43]Alright, I'm probably gonna call it here.
[392:48.91]Maybe like one more match.
[392:54.45]Oh, that's the guy.
[392:58.51]That's the guy I gave my underwear to, by the way.
[393:03.38]Oh my god, that's so stupid.
[393:18.38]Don't hit the guy with the underwear.
[393:21.74]Let me challenge another person.
[393:22.90]Get to the menu.
[393:28.12]I want to try... I go for a belt.
[393:29.29]If I can't get the belt, then I'll call it.
[393:31.03]Keep streaming, idiot.
[393:44.09]No, I'm... No.
[393:50.13]This game is so goddamn funny.
[393:51.85]It really is just so fun.
[393:56.79]Uh oh.
[394:03.34]Your buddy Major Merc suggested that you might like to join us at Wrestling Revolution.
[394:07.18]Okay.
[394:10.62]We feel he'd be a valuable addition to the roster and we're prepared to make it happen with this deal.
[394:16.56]Why Elden Ring are gonna lose a fan forever?
[394:20.98]Dude, I played Elden Ring for like a month straight.
[394:26.29]That's a lot of money.
[394:27.05]They'll pair you with major mercs straight away to help you get you over.
[394:41.05]Hey, Strongman, what do you think of the new hairstyle our stylist suggested for you?
[394:53.09]I think it's fine.
[395:04.03]Okay.
[395:04.98]Let me go for a title match immediately.
[395:08.42]Who has the world championship here?
[395:14.52]Akarite.
[395:15.02]Is this it?
[395:16.54]Looking for a strong new.
[395:19.89]What do you want to talk about?
[395:25.20]I want that title.
[395:28.72]Everybody wants a shot at my inter-title.
[395:31.48]Get to the back.
[395:32.10]Okay.
[395:32.68]Well.
[395:36.35]Is this just a one-off?
[395:37.79]I don't know.
[395:38.13]Maybe I'll play it again another time.
[395:39.29]I kind of want to see something really quick though.
[395:47.49]Did this change at all?
[395:53.59]You could do some really, really wacky stuff here.
[396:01.12]Individuals.
[396:03.40]Hardcore.
[396:14.50]The bathroom, the barbershop, the bar, the subway.
[396:18.38]How do you eliminate people in a subway?
[396:27.00]Plane.
[396:33.80]The tables again.
[396:36.62]Gauntlet, escape to victory.
[396:38.06]What's escape to victory?
[396:38.92]Okay.
[396:42.50]Confrontation, singles.
[396:46.11]Singles.
[396:46.51]Hardcore.
[396:52.73]No falls.
[396:53.87]No stopping.
[396:55.81]No countouts.
[397:01.30]Um, I think this is fine.
[397:06.60]How did we put tables in here before?
[397:08.92]That's my standing.
[397:11.57]Sumo contest?
[397:32.17]They're, uh... Reno?
[397:33.83]Mmm... Eh, maybe not.
[397:36.65]It's fine.
[397:37.33]Oh, here we go.
[397:39.59]Probs.
[398:01.41]It's probably going to crash the game it did last time.
[398:03.05]Let's see what happens.
[398:13.29]Okay, that sounds good.
[398:47.85]Alright, we're gonna just backflip off of this and do a bunch of tables.
[398:53.24]Oh god.
[399:16.02]How did I climb these before?
[399:17.62]Remember how I climbed all the way up?
[399:27.41]Jesus.
[399:27.85]I can't have the broom, okay.
[399:32.73]Here we go.
[399:40.98]Get out of here.
[399:50.01]Come on, climb it.
[399:51.85]Please.
[399:55.99]Whatever.
[399:56.31]That was a Monty Python joke?
[400:03.46]I was standing on top of them before.
[400:11.79]Did they patch out tower climbing?
[400:13.59]Probably not.
[400:14.27]I'm probably just not doing it right.
[400:17.59]Get off!
[400:21.94]How long are you gonna... He just broke my arm.
[400:24.68]What are this guy's stats?
[400:36.12]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[400:42.21]Next stream is going to be on Saturday.
[400:45.83]Do some MS DOS.
[400:49.37]Have like 20 games we can play.
[400:57.18]Maybe even more.
[400:58.78]But it's going to be hard to go through them all.
[401:02.04]Conquer construction, please.
[401:03.16]That's one of them.
[401:03.90]Alright, I got to get out of this.
[401:10.75]Thanks for watching as usual.
[401:12.77]That was a lot of fun.
[401:13.81]This game kind of just drained me mentally and physically.
[401:19.01]It's just such a shit show.
[401:21.23]It's so funny.
[401:22.03]So much wild shit just happens randomly.
[401:27.69]I mean, I'm not going to tell you I'm never going to play this again because obviously it seems like MDickey is updating this all the time.
[401:37.80]That was a lot of fun.
[401:38.50]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[401:39.52]Thanks for watching.
[401:40.87]Goodbye.
[401:41.45]Good night.
[401:49.91]Turn this off.
[401:55.99]Here comes the glove eating stream.
[401:59.01]It's not April 24th yet.
[402:02.20]I've got at least a week.
[402:09.82]What time on Saturday?
[402:10.48]Probably around 4.
[402:12.77]Same time as this one.
[402:17.19]I don't know what I'm gonna start with.
[402:18.09]Somebody said, you kick ass so hard.
[402:33.74]I thought you said, you suck ass so hard.
[402:35.72]Oh no.
[402:38.58]Oh no.
[402:41.05]Now, that stream is a lot of fun.
[402:46.35]Start with Shito.
[402:47.12]Maybe I will.
[402:56.34]I can't believe the guy shit his pants.
[402:59.32]We're glossing over that part of this stream.
[403:02.30]I was holding my ass with two hands, backing up, walking around, getting chased by people, and I shit my pants.
[403:10.35]We kind of just moved on from that really quickly.
[403:12.09]Alright, goodbye.
[403:21.82]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[403:22.94]Take care of yourselves.
[403:26.12]And goodnight.
[404:15.56]Thank you.
[404:50.44]you
