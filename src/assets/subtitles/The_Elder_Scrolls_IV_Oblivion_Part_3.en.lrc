[00:00.61]There it is.
[00:01.23]Nice.
[00:04.57]What's with the hourglass?
[00:12.12]Get the hourglass out of here!
[00:20.44]That's a little better.
[00:25.73]Now you can actually hear me over the music.
[00:29.39]I gotta get this hourglass off.
[00:30.43]This is fucking annoying.
[00:36.66]What was that bullshit?
[00:38.92]Steam, I really wish you would just get away from me.
[00:41.88]Alright, here we go.
[00:46.40]This should fix it.
[00:47.78]If it doesn't, then I'm out of ideas.
[00:52.30]Oh shit, is there a mod here?
[00:56.57]I... I... Can you change it just to Oblivion?
[01:02.83]Can you change it to Oblivion, please?
[01:08.41]No mods here.
[01:13.41]There we go.
[01:14.10]No more hourglass.
[01:15.08]And we're good to go.
[01:15.98]Load game.
[01:18.18]This is where we left off.
[01:20.76]I wonder how the quality would be on this computer.
[01:28.04]How's it look?
[01:33.26]Actually, I think I could play like this.
[01:38.81]I lost the webcam, though.
[01:42.15]Let's turn the audio up.
[01:46.91]That's better.
[01:52.22]Alright, so what were we doing?
[01:54.52]I still... Oh, I forgot.
[01:55.84]I can't...
[01:58.19]God damn it, that person that was making the compilation of this shit is actually going to get a compilation.
[02:06.07]Alright.
[02:07.45]So we were... in the middle of doing something.
[02:12.59]Aren't we on, like, the shimmering, like, the skimming isles or something?
[02:15.38]In order to restore Zedillion, I must activate the Resonator Judgment.
[02:19.60]To do so, I will need to find three Focus Crystals.
[02:21.98]Right, okay, so where the hell were those?
[02:24.52]Where am I now?
[02:26.00]Alright, can I fast travel here?
[02:30.27]Where can I fast travel to?
[02:35.53]I think I have to get out of this town area.
[02:38.35]Get the face cam on?
[02:40.29]It's going to crash the game.
[02:48.74]Come on!
[02:49.86]Alright, we're good.
[02:51.58]But this is such a shit spot.
[03:10.69]It's too far away.
[03:11.51]I have to go like this.
[03:20.40]There we go.
[03:25.44]I can do this.
[03:26.70]One hand up here, one hand back here.
[03:29.84]I'm gonna have to get another fucking folding card table for this.
[03:32.83]Alright, so let's go here.
[03:36.09]I just gotta get out of the building.
[03:44.44]Oh god, I'm supposed to jump everywhere.
[03:51.38]Nice IRL stream.
[03:52.42]Your mod doesn't have enough power.
[03:54.30]Fuck.
[03:55.50]Alright.
[03:59.74]Don't crash.
[04:00.18]Don't crash.
[04:00.76]Don't crash.
[04:01.46]Don't crash.
[04:03.58]How do I change it?
[04:04.08]Where is it?
[04:06.40]Where is it?
[04:06.80]Where is it?
[04:07.22]Where is it?
[04:07.55]Where is it?
[04:07.81]I gotta change it.
[04:08.41]Where is it?
[04:08.91]The fuck is it?
[04:21.69]Oblivion.
[04:22.15]Oblivion.
[04:23.19]Oblivion.
[04:26.58]Got it.
[04:27.76]Don't crash.
[04:29.23]Nice, thank god.
[04:29.79]Alright, I got it.
[04:34.13]Updated.
[04:34.49]Alright, so... Let's... How do we go?
[04:44.31]Do we sound bad?
[04:45.01]Do we look bad?
[04:46.17]I think the answer is yes.
[04:47.79]Now I think I can fast travel, though.
[04:50.01]I should be able to.
[04:52.66]Yes, I want to fast travel here.
[04:58.02]Do a flex cam?
[05:00.42]No, I'm alright.
[05:01.50]I don't need a flex cam.
[05:05.62]This is so awkward right now.
[05:08.39]We can walk from here.
[05:09.25]We're back in business.
[05:12.27]No, not FOV zero.
[05:18.27]That's the power of flex tape.
[05:23.49]That webcam, I don't like the spot it's in, but I can't change it right now.
[05:29.64]I can't do zero FOV guys.
[05:35.40]But.
[05:36.30]To reiterate one more time.
[05:38.62]We're going to have to deal with what we have.
[05:42.66]God of War will be next.
[05:43.93]God of War I should build a stream without a single problem at all.
[05:46.93]Because it's a PS4 game.
[05:49.75]So that will be next week.
[05:50.87]I don't know.
[05:52.27]It depends.
[05:52.63]I still might be enjoying Oblivion.
[05:57.78]Maybe we'll take a break and play God of War and then go back to Oblivion after a few days or beat it.
[06:01.36]I don't know.
[06:03.98]A green screen stream will happen.
[06:06.24]I'm going to do an iPad stream where we play a bunch of iPad games.
[06:10.79]There's a lot still that we can do.
[06:17.71]Game's still IRL.
[06:18.73]I just changed it.
[06:19.39]I just updated it.
[06:23.35]I don't have the PS4 Pro.
[06:24.49]I have the regular one.
[06:30.52]There it is.
[06:30.86]Zedillion.
[06:34.70]Try Persona 5?
[06:35.51]I've never played Persona.
[06:38.49]I've seen people play Persona.
[06:39.73]I've never played it myself.
[06:53.48]Why am I so bad now?
[06:55.60]It's like going over a friend's house and sitting at their computer and they're like, hey dude, I heard you're really good at Fortnite.
[07:00.73]You're like, yeah, I'm actually really fucking good at Fortnite.
[07:03.53]Well, show me!
[07:04.43]And you sit down and you're like, fuck this kid's whole setup.
[07:07.25]It sucks.
[07:08.51]And then you get killed in five seconds.
[07:10.00]You're like, it's your fucking dumb keyboard, man.
[07:21.38]Dude, what the fuck?
[07:22.02]I thought you were supposed to be good.
[07:23.06]No, I am.
[07:24.60]I am.
[07:24.98]I am.
[07:26.06]And you don't want to be mean and say, like, hey, your computer sucks and, like, your microphone sucks.
[07:29.60]Well, that's me projecting because I know my microphone sucks.
[07:42.09]I got a chart.
[07:43.07]I don't have a potion to drink.
[07:46.64]Game freezes, right?
[07:47.58]Yeah.
[07:49.11]Where's my fortitude potion?
[07:50.95]What the hell it is?
[07:53.64]Restore fatigue.
[07:54.34]There it is.
[07:55.50]And... At least I can scroll now.
[07:58.94]This computer doesn't seem to have a problem with it.
[08:03.22]Alright.
[08:12.28]Honestly, this mic is pretty good.
[08:15.87]Maybe I'll use it for other stuff.
[08:21.26]Am I going to be at Tip of the Hats?
[08:22.18]I will not be at Tip of the Hats.
[08:24.21]Tip of the Hats is falling on the same three or four day period that I am moving to Vegas.
[08:31.21]Like, actually, my body is being transplanted there.
[08:36.00]So I will not be able to go to Tip of the Hats, unfortunately.
[08:40.40]I've entered Zedillion.
[08:41.76]I should now begin locating the focus crystals that link the... See?
[08:45.36]This is bullshit.
[08:47.38]Oh.
[08:48.11]Mm-hmm.
[08:50.94]I have to drink all these, by the way.
[08:53.82]The fridge has to be empty.
[08:57.10]Alright, I gotta find the focus crystal.
[08:59.28]Sounds easy enough.
[09:02.88]And don't worry, there's only three.
[09:13.37]Look, I... I didn't have the webcam on the whole time I've been playing Oblivion, so why would I have it on now?
[09:30.22]And now that I have a shit mic and a shit webcam and a shit setup, turn it on and keep it on and make it take up a quarter of the screen.
[09:40.30]That hurt my hand and I didn't even do it.
[09:43.36]It's funny.
[09:43.86]Keep it.
[09:45.00]It's better that way.
[09:45.94]Nice shoulders.
[09:47.21]Thanks, man.
[09:50.87]Bake the facecam full screen with the game in the corner.
[09:53.17]I'm not doing that.
[09:55.51]I'm not going to ruin this playthrough.
[09:57.09]I don't even have time to do that.
[10:14.66]Do you guys really want me to do that shit?
[10:17.86]I hate this.
[10:19.34]I hate this.
[10:23.84]We already did this joke before where I was looking down there.
[10:27.92]And like, I'm watching, but I'm also contributing.
[10:35.92]Mm-hmm.
[10:36.38]He's doing pretty good.
[10:38.61]Ah, not that way.
[10:39.37]That's right.
[10:39.81]Turn left.
[10:40.67]There you go.
[10:47.03]This joke never gets old.
[10:48.59]Yes it does.
[10:50.65]It already is.
[10:53.55]This is already overstayed its welcome.
[11:01.50]How do I press C?
[11:10.33]I told you I was gonna do it.
[11:13.73]Just a little, just a little because I'm at a different, I'm at my friend's house.
[11:23.50]Look, he went in the bathroom.
[11:24.54]He didn't even see me do that.
[11:25.58]What's going on with this mouse?
[11:33.45]I don't have any potions.
[11:38.55]Let me make some potions.
[11:40.25]I might get the controller out.
[11:41.89]I just looked over and got visibly upset by what I see over on this fucking preview.
[11:49.18]I forgot that I just forgot I did it.
[11:51.16]And I don't want it.
[11:52.16]I hate it.
[11:58.82]Don't crash, don't crash, don't crash, don't crash.
[12:04.52]No, it's not.
[12:04.96]It's off-center.
[12:06.56]Fuck.
[12:09.76]Man, that's, like, too big.
[12:10.64]It's taking up the axe.
[12:21.43]I'm okay with that.
[12:26.03]Don't crash.
[12:27.03]Alright.
[12:27.41]That's fine.
[12:31.30]Make it one by one pixel.
[12:33.68]I think I've done that before.
[12:34.60]Alright, let me pay attention here.
[12:36.24]So I've got to find the mana crystal.
[12:39.08]Gate is opened out.
[12:39.70]It's a shortcut.
[12:41.71]I've got athletics.
[12:45.07]I've got to... Don't forget, they have to jump everywhere.
[12:49.99]Do not take jumping for granted.
[12:57.94]That's so funny.
[13:01.44]Let's take a look at the small map.
[13:04.82]Okay.
[13:05.50]So we gotta go... Am I in the right place?
[13:09.09]Yeah.
[13:12.83]I need to... I need potions or something.
[13:15.79]Anything.
[13:16.65]Pots, man.
[13:19.21]Potion of sorcery.
[13:23.87]I need restore fatigue.
[13:28.20]Okay, hold on.
[13:30.57]Damage fatigue.
[13:31.39]Restore strength.
[13:32.09]Fire damage.
[13:32.83]Restore endurance.
[13:37.93]Hound tooth cure poison.
[13:41.17]Restore willpower.
[13:42.55]Restore intelligence.
[13:43.41]We're going to have to farm eventually here or something.
[13:50.24]Because I am pretty much out of materials.
[13:56.29]I gotta let my bar fill up, the green bar.
[14:01.10]You gotta watch it at 160p for the real shit audio.
[14:06.80]Speaking of audio, what happened to it?
[14:17.39]I feel like the game got harder when I put it on a different computer.
[14:21.69]Is that weird?
[14:22.85]Am I making that up?
[14:23.72]I'm making that up, right?
[14:24.64]I have to be.
[14:29.85]uh... train six uh... actually do that where's the handheld bike everybody hated it it was too low so I couldn't use it you know I keep pushing it pushes a kick
[14:54.03]I wish E was just boot.
[14:56.33]But then that's a different game.
[14:58.23]We're talking about that Might and Magic game.
[15:04.86]Ooh!
[15:06.44]That's worth some money.
[15:10.99]It's behind him again.
[15:14.17]Stop saying shit like that.
[15:16.31]You're making me nervous!
[15:24.47]Bind E, explode.
[15:25.45]I'm not going to do that.
[15:31.63]The door opened behind me.
[15:33.37]Well, then it looks like I'm going to get possessed.
[15:37.87]I placed the first focus crystal into its nexus.
[15:39.57]I can now continue searching for focus crystals.
[15:43.65]Now, are they still in here?
[15:46.43]Or do I have to go somewhere else?
[15:47.35]Or are they all in Zedillion?
[15:49.65]That's the question that I have for myself.
[15:53.63]They are.
[15:56.00]they are I think buying spacebar exit to main menu no I'm not doing that I look I had a rough couple of days I just want to sit back relax and have my lactic acid build up in my arm to a point where it hurts to hold the mouse here and we haven't even been streaming for an hour that's just that's what I want that's what I'd like to do and that's what we're going to be doing apparently
[16:27.85]Are we missing audio, too?
[16:29.25]Something's missing.
[16:34.53]Nice shot.
[16:39.69]Shield Bash?
[16:40.53]Ooh, Restore Magicka.
[16:41.25]There we go.
[16:44.21]That's pretty good.
[16:47.19]The music is missing.
[16:48.27]I can still hear it, though.
[16:53.52]No, it's there.
[16:54.64]Some random effects just aren't working.
[16:58.35]It's alright though.
[16:58.89]This computer has been inside of a storage closet for almost two years.
[17:03.99]I'm surprised the fucking thing even turns off.
[17:06.18]So... Let that say something for... What's the manufacturer of this?
[17:10.92]This motherboard?
[17:13.06]I think it's EVGA.
[17:19.68]Yum.
[17:20.62]Oh, yummy.
[17:25.82]Mayonnaise?
[17:26.26]Why are you saying mayonnaise?
[17:34.92]I'm so annoyed at how much... I'm glad that didn't kill me.
[17:40.22]I have not saved.
[17:41.72]At all.
[17:46.42]This game's funny to pray?
[17:47.84]What do you mean, to pray?
[17:51.76]I need to make a couple of potions here.
[17:53.46]You know, I gotta make a couple of potions.
[17:55.87]Do I sound a little bit more interesting when I go like this?
[17:58.85]If I gotta make a couple of potions?
[18:01.05]One or two potions.
[18:02.61]At least.
[18:05.00]I probably sound cool there.
[18:06.82]I bet I sound so cool.
[18:07.88]Alright, I want... We need Magicka.
[18:15.70]Restore Magicka.
[18:19.20]Restore Magicka.
[18:20.42]Restore Magicka.
[18:21.20]There it is.
[18:22.10]One, two, three.
[18:27.14]Over... 19 seconds.
[18:29.28]That's a pretty long time.
[18:33.14]He's doing the tuber voice?
[18:34.12]That's not the tuber voice.
[18:41.69]Do I sound cool when I say Magicka?
[18:47.09]I gotta practice my, uh... I gotta practice the way that I say things.
[18:52.47]Magicka.
[18:53.59]Nevada.
[18:54.29]Like, I have to... It's Nevada, so I have to get it right.
[19:02.34]I'm trying to get... I'm trying to say it correctly.
[19:06.60]It's Nevada.
[19:08.56]Look, I got... A lot of people were very angry with me because I said Nevada.
[19:12.56]And it was like, What did you just say, dude?
[19:18.86]I said, You heard me.
[19:21.06]And they said, Get out of here.
[19:25.22]I don't know, man.
[19:25.80]It's all gone up there.
[19:31.16]Nevada.
[19:32.08]That's Nevada.
[19:35.45]But I like Nevada.
[19:38.87]Nevada is actually the Spanish way to say it, which is the Spanish word.
[19:44.91]But, you know.
[19:52.77]It means on top of the snowy mountain.
[19:55.91]Nevada.
[19:57.61]Look it up.
[19:59.95]Guy that just went, what idiot?
[20:02.81]Look it up.
[20:06.71]That was probably... It is, on top of the snowy mountains, spirits within us, is something like that, is the loose translation.
[20:24.06]I need a crystal.
[20:31.76]I need a crystal.
[20:33.00]Where do I get a crystal?
[20:34.10]Where do I get a crystal from?
[20:39.65]Go get one.
[20:42.87]Well, I know.
[20:43.47]I know I have to have one.
[20:44.37]I know I have to get one, but is it just in this... Is it in this building?
[21:01.59]It's probably not even in this building.
[21:05.73]I want to take this.
[21:07.27]I can take it.
[21:09.78]Crystal staff.
[21:10.82]Wait.
[21:14.70]Oh, it's in the staff.
[21:16.96]It's inside of the guy's staff.
[21:18.60]Okay.
[21:23.06]Last crystal.
[21:25.25]Is over here somewhere.
[21:26.17]Let's take a look at the map.
[21:29.87]We apparently got to go this way.
[21:35.18]Stiff.
[21:36.46]It's in the stiff.
[21:38.46]That don't work.
[21:40.56]Don't say it like that.
[21:45.69]Don't you don't.
[21:51.87]Take a look at the map.
[21:54.41]Take a look at the map.
[21:58.68]Don't you don't.
[22:08.36]Don't you... Oh, can you... Don't.
[22:21.57]Stop hurting me.
[22:25.81]But, all jokes aside and all, like, terrible quality aside, I am very excited.
[22:34.44]It became actually real when all my stuff left the house.
[22:39.06]So... Really looking forward to it.
[22:43.30]Hopefully, uh... Hopefully, we can still get some at least decent streams here and before I actually end there.
[22:50.83]I'm gonna try.
[22:56.55]Your face is terrible quality.
[22:57.93]Ban that guy for life, please.
[23:02.00]If I see that guy talk in another lifetime, I don't want to see it.
[23:13.38]Everybody that says a sentence that says, face sucks, or you, any combination of those things, you, face, sucks, it doesn't matter what sentence they're doing.
[23:28.69]I want them gone forever.
[23:36.48]A lot of people are just trying to get 10 second timeouts here.
[23:43.43]10 second permabands.
[23:45.37]It's a long time.
[23:46.61]Think about your actions before you do them.
[23:48.73]Think about your actions before you do them.
[23:49.87]Think about your actions before you do them.
[23:54.60]You know your gym teacher?
[23:56.30]When he said, think about your actions before you do them.
[24:02.55]Oh, funny story.
[24:03.35]I don't know if I've ever told this before, but one time I... I don't know if this is stream appropriate.
[24:12.24]Is this stream appropriate?
[24:15.14]Probably not.
[24:18.84]It's... Alright, we're going to replace some words here.
[24:25.86]So when I was a younger lad... What's the word I can replace this with?
[24:32.01]I can't say bag.
[24:34.85]I can't say... What else can I say?
[24:38.31]How do I say this?
[24:42.61]Storage unit.
[24:44.11]No, that's like even worse.
[24:46.29]Holder.
[24:47.11]No, that's holder.
[24:49.34]My holders.
[24:50.00]Holders.
[24:53.52]That's even worse.
[24:56.70]It's pee storage.
[24:59.26]Oh, I hate that, but I love it at the same time.
[25:02.42]Alright, my cans.
[25:03.32]No, that's another thing.
[25:05.77]My bottles.
[25:07.73]My baggage.
[25:08.39]My baggage.
[25:09.03]There you go.
[25:09.55]Okay.
[25:10.91]So, when I was probably like 14, I want to say, I had some problems with my baggage.
[25:21.02]I had what was medically defined as a baggage appendix.
[25:30.91]And I was told that it's okay.
[25:33.91]You're fine.
[25:34.95]Don't worry about it.
[25:35.73]Everything's going to be just fine.
[25:38.19]Your baggage is going to absorb this into the baggage.
[25:43.90]And you're going to be just fine.
[25:46.24]It hurts so much.
[25:48.63]It was one of the most painful things ever.
[25:50.67]It felt like my baggage...
[25:52.57]was all lost.
[25:54.77]It felt like a company that wasn't JetBlue lost my baggage.
[25:59.65]You know what I mean?
[26:00.65]So I'm going to die.
[26:01.43]Hold on.
[26:04.31]I actually am going to die.
[26:05.83]Wait.
[26:11.28]Yeah.
[26:15.52]Alright, okay.
[26:16.50]So, um... It was as if I got to the airport and looked down and said, Fuck, man, they lost, it's not coming on the carousel, it's all twisted, it's down the carousel, but that's not my bag, it's twisting around.
[26:28.82]That's what it felt like.
[26:31.14]Like, eight times.
[26:33.12]So, uh, I was fine, but I had to bring a doctor's note to my phys ed teacher.
[26:42.57]And he thought it was like fake.
[26:46.69]He thought I was being a little asshole.
[26:50.02]He had no idea what this was.
[26:52.32]He was just like,
[26:57.07]So you don't want to run the mile.
[27:00.07]You know when they make you run the mile and they give you the opportunity to walk the mile, but it's very clear that if you don't complete the mile in, what was it, like 14 minutes, then you were just a scrub, right?
[27:12.67]So nobody wants to not complete the mile over 16.
[27:16.27]If you complete the mile over 16 minutes, it was like, fuck, dude, I don't want to be a scrub.
[27:21.61]So, by the way, I did the mile in about seven and a half minutes.
[27:26.55]Just, you know, that's without the baggage.
[27:28.87]Well, that, well... That's with that, like, I'm talking about, like, without this problem, right?
[27:36.98]So, my... So, my, when I, the baggage of JetBlue...
[27:42.00]Man, does that company have good baggage policies here.
[27:45.00]I mean, you're talking about overhead space is incredibly large.
[27:48.63]It can hold, you bring a carry-ons are free.
[27:51.25]Carry-ons are free on JetBlue.
[27:52.71]You don't have to pay extra money.
[27:54.37]Why would you need to do that?
[27:56.39]Every seat, at least six more inches than American and United combined.
[28:02.12]They've got great baggage on JetBlue.
[28:05.48]But anyways, so he thought I was trying to get out of running the mile, but little did he know that I couldn't do it.
[28:16.75]So eventually it was like an awkward conversation where I had to tell him about my baggage, and that was really fucking weird.
[28:25.32]But fast forward a couple weeks when I was okay, I wanted to show him that I mean fucking business, dude.
[28:33.93]I mean business.
[28:35.07]And I'm going to get this mile in fucking under seven or eight minutes.
[28:39.19]And I wanted to prove to him that, hey, fuck you, dude.
[28:41.47]Look at me.
[28:41.85]I'm fucking good.
[28:42.61]I'm fucking fit and I'm an athlete.
[28:44.99]so I did it I did the mile in like seven something and it was great it was an achievement and after I was done with the mile uh I threw up behind a tree and almost passed out and had to lie down on my back and I like threw up on my side because I was I fucked myself up so badly and I had to be one of those guys they had to bring the wheelchair out for me
[29:08.95]and put me in the fucking wheelchair and like wheelchair me through the halls because I couldn't like move so me trying so desperately to show this guy that yeah my baggage was real and like eat that ended up like I was the guy that they made like I'm rolling down in the wheelchair and everyone's just like what the fuck happened is he like what the fuck and I'm just like I'm fine I know nothing I can do it that's the whole story
[29:41.26]But it was seriously, it was like a movie.
[29:43.12]It was right when the fucking bell rang.
[29:45.52]Like, I wouldn't have cared.
[29:46.40]Just like, dude, like, can we just wait till the fucking, till everyone's in their classes?
[29:50.42]Like, do you have to do this now?
[29:54.54]It was like flooding the hallways.
[29:57.39]Here comes Jeremy in the wheelchair.
[30:00.15]It's just like, fuck, man.
[30:01.37]Like, there's 5,000 people all looking at me.
[30:06.29]But my ball sack got better, eventually, is the story.
[30:10.87]And I think I, yeah, whatever.
[30:24.82]Am I allowed to say that?
[30:27.24]I don't know.
[30:29.36]I'm like, I was carrying volleyballs.
[30:32.10]And it, dude, there's a rip in the middle, and I couldn't, like, fuck, man, like, I'm carrying these folly balls from the gym!
[30:39.00]And it tore, and, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[30:41.58]I had to pick them all up.
[30:46.61]And that's how you stay protected on Twitch, you know, when you say things like that.
[30:50.07]Wait, don't say that, though.
[30:51.69]That's not, I shouldn't be saying that.
[30:54.01]What I should say is, I should clarify, uh, what I just said is omitted from the record, that was off the record.
[31:05.19]Just play the game.
[31:06.51]It's okay.
[31:12.69]I'm sorry.
[31:14.01]I'm sorry.
[31:14.44]I'm probably very irritating right now.
[31:17.14]But I'm like, I got energy, you know?
[31:19.24]Listen, let's talk about this for a second.
[31:21.80]I was about to plug in the other microphone.
[31:23.20]No.
[31:24.82]I'm finally fucking moving to Las Vegas.
[31:28.77]I got a story about moving.
[31:34.20]It's finally fucking happening.
[31:36.56]Been talking about this shit for at least six months.
[31:40.51]And it's... I can't wait.
[31:42.67]I'm so... And I'm just walking in fucking circles.
[31:45.95]We have to go this way.
[31:49.18]Turn around.
[31:51.62]Go over here.
[31:54.14]Okay, good work.
[32:02.87]Oh, you're doing swell here.
[32:06.73]Does the story also involve baggage?
[32:09.19]Yeah.
[32:10.49]A lot of them, actually.
[32:13.57]At least, like, 12 to 15 different baggages that all had to be picked up and, you know, thrown around and put inside the back of that, uh... Alright, I'm fucking dead here.
[32:29.50]I'm actually dead.
[32:46.11]Don't you... Don't!
[32:51.11]I don't want to die.
[32:58.72]I got all the crystals activated.
[33:00.24]I did a stupid task.
[33:02.72]Alright, we're good.
[33:05.00]Although, not really.
[33:17.88]I feel like that's cheating.
[33:20.85]That feels very cheat-like.
[33:22.27]Alright, we're good.
[33:32.97]Keep going.
[33:33.74]Actually, should I go up in here?
[33:34.90]Because that's it, right?
[33:37.28]I think we can just leave.
[33:38.18]Do I have to activate anything else?
[33:44.18]Path to the resonator of judgment itself is now clear.
[33:46.02]My next task should be to attune the resonator by using the attunator by judgment that he gave me.
[33:49.88]Alright, so I guess I just have to go.
[33:53.02]We're just going to keep going.
[34:02.93]That's the Harry Potter door.
[34:04.21]I mean, it's a pretty cool door.
[34:13.37]Having no magic really does just suck.
[34:15.05]2005?
[34:21.64]What about 2005?
[34:23.24]Now I can't tell if I'm dropping frames because the internet sucks or if I'm dropping frames because this computer sucks.
[34:32.77]That's a great question.
[34:41.15]Hey, I got to level up.
[34:43.09]That's good.
[34:44.87]What are the specs on this thing?
[34:45.95]This is a i7-4770K.
[34:49.78]A 780, I think, is in there.
[34:54.24]16 gigs of RAM.
[34:57.82]It's not bad.
[34:59.64]There's the matrix.
[35:01.38]I found a matrix that looks like it might be involved for a different type of armor.
[35:03.90]I should ask around someone in the Shivering Isles.
[35:06.16]Must know what these are for.
[35:07.05]Okay.
[35:08.49]I was looking for one of those.
[35:12.21]I can't fucking move.
[35:16.45]Is this still the shitty Green Day build?
[35:18.05]Oh, absolutely.
[35:18.79]Yes, it is.
[35:19.25]This is the shitty Green Day build.
[35:23.92]265, 265.
[35:30.30]Don't I have some random dumb shit here?
[35:33.72]I know I picked up like a fork.
[35:36.04]I did.
[35:38.21]Alright, can I move now?
[35:40.45]No.
[35:48.29]Just going to use this.
[35:51.44]Well, this needs it very badly.
[35:56.34]Maybe that's why I was doing so badly.
[35:57.82]I couldn't get anything.
[35:58.86]Couldn't hurt anything.
[36:00.74]Could have just used it.
[36:01.72]Pick it up and use it.
[36:05.40]Five damage.
[36:06.12]Like, really?
[36:13.06]Melodramatic fools.
[36:17.50]There it is.
[36:19.74]I'm going to save because I feel like something weird is going to happen here.
[36:26.82]No, I just bumped the mic.
[36:27.78]Sorry, guys.
[36:28.26]I have attuned the resonator.
[36:30.76]I should now make my way back to New Sheoth and report my success to Sheogorath.
[36:38.99]Cool.
[36:45.29]Finally, Lord Sheogorath sent someone to assist me.
[36:49.70]That's why I don't like webcam.
[36:51.62]Because I can do that and you don't even know I did it.
[36:55.42]That happens all the time.
[36:56.88]Welcome to Zedillion.
[36:58.79]I'm the dungeon caretaker, Kiliband Nerendil.
[37:05.58]tell me how you like it in this place slurp slurp slurp slurp is there any like funny shit here?
[37:12.08]I don't think so everything went in the trash listen to the story I'll be right back ever since that wretched gatekeeper was made
[37:36.22]You're gonna blow a fuse.
[37:57.17]This rendered the resonator in Earth and Zedillion completely useless.
[38:02.39]Luckily, you came along and placed Zedillion back into operation.
[38:13.33]Alright, so what happened?
[38:26.16]I ACTUALLY JUST GOT FUCKING ELECTROCUTED!
[38:29.95]WHAT?!
[38:36.23]I SWEAR TO GOD!
[38:39.18]Alright, get that out of there!
[38:47.02]No bullshit, that actually just happened!
[38:50.85]Right here!
[38:51.57]Right in like the pic- What was I even gonna do with that?! !
[38:58.21]I don't know what I was gonna do with that how funny is that that I turned a light on that doesn't make any sense hold on hold on let me try come on come on please come on please please no whatever fucking stupid
[39:28.77]pissed off yes yes I tend to ram that really happened if you have the attenuator then share God must have sent you zedillion would normally have sent you back to the entrance when you stepped on the pad in the resonator like I can feel like a halt out here since you're up here it was just only surmise that adventurers are already entering the dungeon as we speak whatever I'm fine I can't like does anybody have a I want to like see that what happened
[40:01.60]could be like my back to hurt lately but I would killed my body let me just like it out of this I'm afraid until the adventurers are dead the daily will keep you here even dot can't will its doors to put it you're stuck here for the moment at no disrespect
[40:31.04]The only thing we can do is let the adventurers complete a cycle through here.
[40:35.72]I'll be glad to help.
[40:38.22]I assume Shere Gorath gave you the manual of Zedillion.
[40:42.28]You can consult it for more information, or I can provide instructions.
[40:48.88]Alright.
[40:49.44]Baiting the trap.
[40:53.28]Do I know what day it is?
[40:55.41]Is it my birthday yet?
[40:57.75]No.
[40:59.27]Not for a long time.
[41:02.24]It looks like your grandparents first time skyping you.
[41:05.30]I want to see how this happened.
[41:11.30]I'll talk to him in a second.
[41:14.80]We'll be right here.
[41:18.82]I want to fucking look at that.
[41:23.47]So what happened?
[41:33.96]What?
[41:35.04]Why is it not available?
[41:39.16]The clip's not available.
[41:41.73]Sorry, unless you've got a time machine, that content is unavailable.
[41:46.77]What are you talking about?
[41:51.69]What?
[41:53.55]Oh, I know why.
[41:54.62]I know why.
[41:55.10]It's because my clock...
[42:00.70]My battery is dead in here, so it's like four hours ago right now.
[42:03.99]I have to change the time.
[42:07.59]The certificate doesn't make any sense.
[42:11.39]I zapped back in time.
[42:14.81]Change date and time.
[42:15.57]I can't fucking believe I got actually electrocuted on stream.
[42:24.92]Alright, now it's 8... What time is it?
[42:27.62]8.13.
[42:27.64]This should work now.
[42:31.37]Yeah, the battery, my, like, computer actual internal battery is gone.
[42:37.09]It's, like, dead.
[42:38.35]So it can't keep track of the time.
[42:45.13]Yeah, it's, I can't do it.
[42:48.03]Because right now, click the link text.
[42:55.58]That's what I'm doing.
[42:56.98]Well, now, there we go.
[43:01.34]Can you even, like, hold on.
[43:11.35]When I first, like, grab it, and I move to, like, turn it on, it goes, like, is that weird or what?
[43:18.65]Oh!
[43:23.41]Has that been happening the whole time?
[43:36.56]It's because that headset.
[43:38.30]Is it because I'm wearing, like, the headset?
[43:42.62]Am I, like, overthinking this?
[43:43.70]Probably.
[43:46.50]New sub sound.
[43:47.30]Me getting fucking electrocuted?
[43:48.64]Oh, maybe I can do math now.
[43:54.06]Give me a math problem.
[44:04.95]16.
[44:05.07]Got it.
[44:06.07]See, even when I start to decipher problems, I feel like an extra sense on me.
[44:12.05]You know what I mean?
[44:13.27]Square root of 5 minus 2 times 4x is solved for x.
[44:18.95]14.
[44:20.67]Well, I don't understand.
[44:22.05]That's so weird.
[44:22.57]It feels fucking weird when I do that.
[44:28.09]Can we get one more?
[44:32.63]Two plus thirty-four plus twenty-six.
[44:36.15]Seventy-eight.
[44:39.59]That kind of hurts though, when I do that.
[44:41.73]Don't- I don't want any more math problems.
[44:46.28]I can like- I can taste blood.
[44:51.22]Fucking weird, whatever.
[44:57.08]Why do I hear like a baby?
[45:02.82]Did you guys hear a baby?
[45:03.75]I'm cursed now forever.
[45:15.28]It didn't crash.
[45:16.30]Remarkable.
[45:19.96]Fucking stupid ass light.
[45:30.45]I'm about to fucking put my foot through the screen.
[45:33.29]Get out of my way.
[45:34.07]Alright, here.
[45:39.45]I feel like I'm reading so far into this.
[45:42.01]I'm going to psych myself out so bad.
[45:44.51]Okay.
[45:51.52]It's up to me to decide whether to allow Zolidian to kill them or drive them insane.
[45:56.64]Group of adventurers.
[45:59.20]Ooh, that sounds like fun.
[46:02.70]Is this really going to be a joke stream with an empty house?
[46:06.86]I mean, there is no joke here.
[46:12.82]I'm in an empty house.
[46:15.07]I'm in my empty house.
[46:17.51]There's no joke.
[46:19.83]What can I assist you with?
[46:23.17]The Resonator works by drawing adventurers to itself with a sort of magical siren's call.
[46:30.73]Chirgorath uses the resonator to find the cream of the crop, as he calls them.
[46:35.59]The best of the worst to populate the isles.
[46:39.92]Quite clever, eh?
[46:43.74]As the adventurers make their way through Zedillion's chambers, they will encounter choices that you make in these control platforms.
[46:52.57]All you need to do is decide what becomes of the adventurers.
[46:56.49]Will you drive them insane or will you pull the life from their bodies?
[47:01.31]So I'm playing death run with a bunch of friends.
[47:05.70]Simple.
[47:06.64]Wait until the adventurers are in position and then press a button.
[47:11.62]If they survived, they will proceed to the next chamber and so on.
[47:16.18]This sounds fun.
[47:17.71]I'm looking forward to this.
[47:19.75]Can I electrocute them?
[47:21.41]So I can take my fucking anger out on someone?
[47:23.23]Okay.
[47:24.17]This looks like your Dark Souls character.
[47:25.11]Okay.
[47:45.48]The other choice is more mental.
[47:47.48]I'm doing a lot of teeth licking today.
[47:48.50]They are designed to make the adventurers lose their grip on reality, much like the residents of Mania.
[47:56.11]Of course, the introduction of spore gas with the Mania choices helps as well.
[48:00.51]Spore.
[48:01.59]Spore.
[48:02.83]Spore.
[48:04.57]Alright.
[48:05.87]That's enough information.
[48:06.75]As you wish.
[48:07.64]Fuck off.
[48:13.64]Certainly.
[48:15.36]He loves me.
[48:16.14]I don't need to do anything.
[48:18.94]Alright, let's go... Let's go kill some adventurers or something.
[48:24.26]Where are the buttons?
[48:25.52]Inactive switch.
[48:27.04]Inactive switch.
[48:29.24]What?
[48:43.70]Why is he floating?
[48:45.36]Oh.
[49:13.45]Oh.
[49:13.53]It was madness.
[49:13.98]It was madness.
[49:15.42]Can I just like shoot at them with arrows?
[49:20.14]Who?
[49:40.97]I've unleashed the giant Gnarl on the adventurers in Sir Lydian.
[49:43.72]With the threat of what he perceived as certain death knocking at his door, Lewin the Rogue has gone insane.
[49:49.58]I should make my way to the next observation room and choose how the adventurers will encounter their next optical.
[50:05.43]Watching them run from the giant Gnarl gets me every time.
[50:12.94]Oh, pet.
[50:19.60]Oh.
[50:20.34]Alright, so that was that one.
[50:21.50]Let's kill somebody.
[50:29.64]I got it.
[50:31.14]Got you guys.
[50:34.54]Didn't do anything.
[50:46.96]Look at those jewels Gromok, be careful This looks too good to be true Let's see them stop me after I rip this cake from its hinges Gromok, no!
[51:16.75]Wait, they're both dead!
[51:31.29]Explosive arrows, dude!
[51:33.79]Using a huge pile of treasure as bait, I lured the two remaining adventurers into a fire trap.
[51:38.17]Sindelius, the mage, didn't survive the blast, leaving only their leader Gromick.
[51:42.18]I should make my way to the last observation room and choose how the stubborn orc will encounter his final obstacle.
[51:51.75]Can't do it.
[51:57.13]I almost did it.
[52:01.01]I don't think I want to kill this guy, though.
[52:08.44]I think I want to do the mania one.
[52:11.68]We did mania kill mania. ...
[52:24.41]Alright, go crazy.
[52:25.99]Will it work?
[52:31.41]I didn't... Did I press the wrong one?
[52:32.47]Sounds like I'm talking right now.
[52:33.47]I would be saying these things.
[52:49.55]What's this glitch in this game?
[52:50.97]What the fuck?
[52:51.65]I died!
[52:53.64]Yeah, he's fine.
[53:03.67]By making Gromok think that he actually died and became a ghost, I've driven him insane.
[53:07.55]Now that all the adventurers have been dealt with, I should speak to...Gillyman.
[53:17.65]Hey, I did it.
[53:18.37]My apprentice.
[53:18.81]Give me shit for this, because... I mean, no, don't give me shit for this, but look at my posture right now.
[53:23.55]That's pretty bad.
[53:25.73]Right?
[53:25.93]Like, keep me up to date on that.
[53:47.33]I just, like, leaned in and was listening.
[53:51.13]It's gotta be like this.
[53:53.91]At all times.
[53:56.17]Don't let me do that shit.
[53:57.99]I'm gonna get, like... I'm gonna get the T-Rex head.
[54:02.37]The Skeksis from the Lost Crystal.
[54:04.25]Okay.
[54:18.60]I won.
[54:18.90]I win.
[54:19.06]But it's hard to do it like this, guys.
[54:20.58]You understand?
[54:21.14]You try to do it like this.
[54:23.76]Ooh, a weapon.
[54:47.97]Thank you.
[54:48.27]Embrace the crooked spine?
[54:49.01]No, I'm not going to embrace the crooked spine.
[54:50.95]I'm going to get surgery.
[54:51.63]Duskfang added.
[55:21.12]This thing sucks.
[55:24.10]Three damage.
[55:24.74]So it's four damage.
[55:26.72]Nourish blade on strike.
[55:30.25]Stupid.
[55:31.13]Fucking delete it.
[55:34.71]Um... 2A iron short sword.
[55:37.59]Get rid of this.
[55:40.71]Dagger.
[55:41.21]Get rid of it.
[55:41.67]Wait.
[55:41.93]Hold on.
[55:42.21]That had poison on it.
[55:48.43]That's not...
[55:55.54]This is just trash.
[55:57.54]I stole it anyways.
[56:01.14]Dustbang is great.
[56:02.26]Only infinite magical weapon in the game.
[56:16.34]I don't want it.
[56:18.84]That looks good, but I'm blunt.
[56:20.84]I don't have any points into swords or anything.
[56:27.40]Oh, Jesus.
[56:28.66]Water breathing on self-detect life.
[56:31.71]And then feather.
[56:33.49]Potion of healing.
[56:34.77]Take them all.
[56:37.25]And drop a touch.
[56:42.67]And I still can move.
[56:43.35]That's worth it.
[56:45.32]That was actually really worth it.
[56:48.28]Cool.
[56:48.74]Alright, so now I gotta go back to Shigarath.
[56:51.88]Right?
[56:53.26]Blunt uses arrows.
[56:57.44]Really?
[56:59.64]Blunt uses arrows.
[57:01.04]What the fuck is going on here?
[57:09.81]You want to help me here?
[57:14.95]Can he die?
[57:22.77]How is he dead?
[57:23.29]He's dead.
[57:29.77]Who the fuck are these people?
[57:41.43]Before exiting Zilean, I was attacked by three unusual beings in equally strange armor.
[57:45.03]I should ask Killeben if he knows anything about them.
[57:54.04]I can't pick up their armor.
[57:57.30]Blunt using an axe.
[58:01.36]Axes are blunt in this game.
[58:02.54]They are.
[58:04.54]They're classified as blunt.
[58:05.54]It's in the manual.
[58:06.76]Okay.
[58:21.52]smoke a blunt LOL laughing my ass off am I still in irl by the way I want to make sure that's not happening anymore no okay good alright we're gonna go
[58:47.95]I have two of these.
[58:49.03]This thing sucks.
[58:49.59]Get rid of it.
[58:50.75]Alright, let's get out of here.
[58:54.71]Let's go complete this quest for real.
[58:58.25]That sounds good to me.
[59:06.98]Have I eaten dinner?
[59:08.54]I had lunch earlier, so no, I have not had dinner.
[59:14.50]I missed the loot.
[59:17.35]I'm going to smoke weed on stream in Vegas.
[59:19.33]No.
[59:20.31]Why would I do that?
[59:23.34]I mean, it's legal, but why would... I'm not going to smoke weed on stream.
[59:31.42]Did I eat the sandwich?
[59:32.30]I did not eat the sandwich.
[59:35.09]I gave it to one of the movers.
[59:38.57]I didn't do that.
[59:39.39]I'm kidding.
[59:53.02]You realize that I have the same nose as the guy you talked to.
[59:55.69]Ban that guy for life.
[60:01.81]Can I steal his fruits?
[60:05.55]I can.
[60:10.19]Well, look who's here.
[60:11.79]Well, now.
[60:12.79]What news do you have to report?
[60:18.01]Did I just get electrocuted again?
[60:19.39]So soon?
[60:20.65]I did it.
[60:20.91]Not a surprise, I suppose.
[60:22.57]I won.
[60:23.57]We'll get to that later.
[60:25.43]No need to burden your little brain with it now.
[60:28.83]Put your weapon away.
[60:30.15]I keep forgetting that you're right.
[60:31.11]And Zedillion, since you're standing here, I assume you've succeeded.
[60:35.60]Or you're terribly confused.
[60:37.40]Or really lacking in good judgment.
[60:39.84]Is that the guy that does Mr. Krabs?
[60:40.96]No, it's not.
[60:44.15]Geez!
[60:44.29]Why?
[60:44.43]Why?
[61:06.74]So I can summon some dude now You better wait Haskell added
[61:37.62]Summon Haskell.
[61:43.31]There he is.
[61:43.67]Jerma, your nose looks like that guy's nose.
[61:45.65]Look, I fell on my back when I was on a trampoline when I was like 15.
[61:50.57]And my knees came back and kicked me right in the fucking nose.
[61:53.56]Your hair looks like that guy's hair.
[61:56.36]No it don't.
[62:15.41]Isn't that a hoot?
[62:16.93]I love it myself.
[62:18.61]Best part of being a Daedric Prince, really.
[62:20.83]Go ahead.
[62:21.81]Try it again.
[62:23.21]He loves it.
[62:24.39]Does that cost mana?
[62:27.26]No.
[62:30.80]I see you've returned.
[62:32.60]How exciting for you.
[62:34.74]I believe you have some news.
[62:35.74]Can you have followers in this game?
[62:37.64]What do you mean followers?
[62:38.53]Perhaps you should be speaking with him instead of illuminating me with your presence.
[62:46.77]Just one more time.
[62:48.33]At least... Why do I... I don't want to do this again.
[62:52.16]Ah, summoned again.
[62:57.98]My lord does so enjoy that.
[63:00.55]As is his prerogative.
[63:03.03]I'll assume you're done for now.
[63:12.71]Good, good.
[63:13.77]You'll need all the help you can get if you're going to defeat Jigalag and stop the Gray March.
[63:18.83]Okay.
[63:19.85]Stop this new guy.
[63:20.63]Don't expect to summon dear Haskell anywhere but in the realm.
[63:24.49]He dislikes leaving my presence.
[63:27.51]I get that sometimes.
[63:32.23]I can't, like, do this over here.
[63:33.37]Alright.
[63:34.35]Who is that?
[63:34.85]Who am I going to get now?
[63:36.41]Prince of Order.
[63:38.19]Or biscuits.
[63:39.11]No, no.
[63:39.69]Order.
[63:40.85]And not in a good way.
[63:43.58]I've got like, veiny hands, don't I?
[63:47.82]Boring!
[63:48.47]I hate this spring?
[63:50.29]Why?
[64:13.34]What did I do?
[64:16.18]Am I muted or something?
[64:17.48]No, you're not muted.
[64:19.29]I need to get this off my head.
[64:27.81]I'm switching to the other microphone.
[64:30.90]I don't like this.
[64:31.52]I'm going to do the handheld mic.
[64:38.14]An event.
[64:39.42]A movement.
[64:41.40]An apocalypse of sorts.
[64:43.26]Happens every year at the end of every era.
[64:45.44]Which is to say, now.
[64:50.09]A gray march comes and Jiggalag walks.
[64:55.57]What do you want me to do?
[64:57.13]Ask?
[64:58.09]I don't ask.
[64:59.81]I tell.
[65:01.01]This is my realm, remember?
[65:02.63]My creation, my place.
[65:03.83]Play Magic the Gathering.
[65:04.63]My rules.
[65:07.27]Dance for our amusement.
[65:09.62]Where?
[65:09.74]Like here?
[65:10.20]I'm not gonna dance here.
[65:11.68]I can't do a house tour unless I pick up the whole computer.
[65:33.79]It's attached to the wall.
[65:36.55]I'm going to get hurt if I go in there.
[65:43.14]You're strong enough.
[65:45.58]Not really.
[65:46.48]Not anymore.
[65:48.25]Get an extension cord.
[65:51.05]Just plug this in.
[65:52.51]I have to turn the computer off.
[65:54.95]Plug it into a huge extension cord and walk the computer around the huts.
[65:58.39]Oh my god.
[65:59.21]Okay.
[66:00.03]This is called addiction.
[66:01.25]Actually, we got a lot of quests.
[66:03.27]Okay.
[66:03.53]Where are they?
[66:05.57]What do we got to do?
[66:24.20]Speak to the Duke of Mania and the Duchess of Dementia.
[66:27.44]Better understand the inner workings of the realm.
[66:29.14]Need to travel to the House of Dementia and seek an audience with Syl.
[66:34.52]So, seek an audience in Mania.
[66:38.84]So, Mania, Dementia, or learn about both.
[66:42.14]Well, let's just do... We're in Mania.
[66:44.37]So, I'm going to track this one.
[66:47.17]So, it's right... Apparently, it's right here.
[66:54.38]Put this sword away.
[67:00.08]The castle is both mania and dementia.
[67:03.07]Okay.
[67:03.45]Well, let's talk to you.
[67:05.97]Can I eat this?
[67:09.57]It would be unwise to touch the Duke's meal in a public place.
[67:15.96]I can't eat any of these things.
[67:16.98]Okay, that's fine.
[67:18.93]uh... hi you couldn't imagine how I guess we had to get to a bed so you're right could you in fact imagine just how long did I get it that scratch the itch that you had did I scratch the itch inside of your ear uh... you don't care
[67:47.38]I thought I did.
[67:48.82]But then I also thought that you would be heavier.
[67:52.84]Look at you.
[67:53.42]You're light as a chair.
[67:55.40]How do you walk around like that?
[67:59.13]That's not... I have heavy armor on.
[68:00.69]Either way.
[68:02.93]All of it.
[68:04.21]Nothing is right without the challenge.
[68:07.61]That's a pretty good hat made out of chocolate, though, I will say.
[68:10.27]Is he calling me short?
[68:13.95]I don't think he is.
[68:14.59]He sees the webcam.
[68:16.27]I feel like my ears are going to fall off.
[68:21.17]I hate these headsets.
[68:24.27]Alright, well, does he like me?
[68:36.86]Fuck that minigame.
[68:38.38]That's why people look like me.
[68:41.10]Who is he talking about?
[68:57.97]We hold on to fleeting things, even as we sleep.
[69:02.35]I knew, and yet I indulged myself anyway.
[69:05.87]I indulged her a fair bit, too.
[69:08.72]I want to, like, lie down and play this.
[69:10.88]It was passion.
[69:12.20]It was forbidden.
[69:15.04]Oh, the things that would be said, I got out.
[69:19.67]That made it all the more delicious.
[69:24.40]From Dementia's own court, perhaps.
[69:27.91]Scandalous.
[69:29.63]Fatal, perhaps.
[69:31.17]But passion makes no accommodation for self-preservation.
[69:39.39]You guys ready for a sleepover?
[69:44.62]Can I even do this?
[70:02.01]This is getting weird.
[70:03.39]Hold on.
[70:14.81]I feel like I'm at my friend's house.
[70:16.72]Hanging out.
[70:17.64]Playing like turtles in time.
[70:19.36]Don't touch that, you'll get electrocuted.
[70:24.64]How is this better?
[70:37.17]That was I'm uncomfortable Okay Don't you If you don't you might You wouldn't fall for her Not the type
[70:58.91]opposites repel strange this feels so good all that pleasure and pain locked away now as if it never happened unfortunately the chalice is locked away as well I just hurt my stomach I just hurt my stomach but fetching it might do you some good the guy just like lying here like dead on the ground can you see it are you
[71:29.03]Thaddeus asked that I retrieve for him the Chalice of Reversible.
[71:31.53]I need to find someone in this court who knows where it might be.
[71:35.36]Okay.
[71:45.05]I can't see.
[71:46.98]You've been speaking to Thayden, I can tell.
[71:49.78]He has a certain effect on people.
[71:53.51]Did he mention the weed, perhaps?
[71:56.31]Or was there something else you wanted to discuss?
[72:08.78]Alright, that's better.
[72:13.22]I've heard that skinned hounds don't like fire.
[72:21.99]I can't release two, though.
[72:27.50]Don't go too far.
[72:29.54]I'm done.
[72:30.04]I'm going to the bathroom.
[72:35.64]I'm going to the bathroom.
[72:40.99]I'm right back.
[73:20.51]Thank you.
[74:53.22]I'm just doing it for a joke.
[74:58.01]Alright, I'll give you some.
[74:59.81]This is going to be a joke.
[75:26.17]They can!
[75:28.23]Hey.
[75:34.55]I'm not sneezing.
[75:35.13]That's not me sneezing.
[75:37.25]I'm on camera.
[75:38.19]Wrong mic.
[75:38.63]Hold on.
[75:41.69]So.
[75:43.99]Do it.
[75:47.13]That's not what I wanted.
[75:49.49]I said I could drink.
[75:56.08]There's nothing funny about this.
[75:57.23]I don't know why I even brought this down here.
[75:59.71]I could have just drank it up there and then come back down.
[76:06.45]I should have just drank it up there.
[76:12.25]And I'm about to drink out of it.
[76:15.40]Everyone's saying, oh, you're gross, you're gross.
[76:16.90]Don't do that, right?
[76:17.72]Everyone's about to say that.
[76:19.48]Look, I have a cup down here already.
[76:26.01]I'm not gonna... This is not a joke.
[76:27.43]I can't spell this on the carpet.
[76:28.85]I have to get... That would be bad.
[76:32.45]I don't... Fuck it.
[76:32.97]Don't even care.
[76:40.29]Look, I gotta sell this place.
[76:42.57]I'm not, like, dumping.
[76:44.94]I stopped it immediately.
[76:46.68]So, um... Look at...
[76:56.72]That's where I got electrocuted.
[76:57.60]Look at that.
[76:58.82]It indented in my hand.
[77:01.60]No.
[77:03.22]Mic, mic, mic.
[77:03.84]I'll switch it.
[77:10.59]There we go.
[77:12.01]That's a better one.
[77:15.11]So I've come to this kind of stark realization.
[77:18.51]Okay.
[77:22.35]It's like this hurts to play here.
[77:24.73]Like this sucks playing like this.
[77:35.60]I gotta get rid of this before I fucking dump it or something.
[77:39.66]So let me try a controller.
[77:44.16]Grab a controller and a pillow.
[77:47.60]I feel like with a controller this might be a little better.
[77:49.34]Give me like one more minute.
[77:51.80]Bear with me here.
[78:33.26]Okay.
[78:34.78]Let's see if I can use this now.
[78:40.40]Move this back.
[78:47.09]I wonder if I can use this.
[78:47.81]I'm gonna have to relearn the buttons.
[78:59.81]PS4 controller not going to work.
[79:05.71]Shit.
[79:17.64]I have to relaunch the game.
[79:21.98]Will do.
[79:22.58]Let's try it again.
[79:31.21]This is a really old game, though, on PC.
[79:33.11]I don't know if there would be controller support.
[79:34.68]Will there be?
[79:39.48]Maybe not.
[79:41.80]We'll find out.
[79:46.12]PC Oblivion does not have controller support.
[79:55.15]Well, we're going to have to deal with it.
[79:56.93]I mean, I will.
[80:08.26]Go back to what I was doing before.
[80:18.86]Uh, stream Minecraft.
[80:20.08]I'm not going to stream Minecraft.
[80:21.86]Why would I do that?
[80:23.58]Why would I do that?
[80:25.22]Steam controller binds?
[80:28.37]No, we're already doing like dog shit stream Friday.
[80:32.89]I don't want to have you guys sit here for like another 15 minutes.
[80:42.17]I'm fine.
[80:42.71]I can hang.
[80:44.09]I can handle this.
[80:46.27]Alright, what have we got?
[80:50.02]Retrieve the Chalice of Reversal.
[80:51.54]I need to find someone in this court or in Sills who knows where it might be.
[80:56.30]I've got to find the Chalice.
[80:59.58]You're the one that gave me the mission.
[81:00.80]You don't know where it is.
[81:01.90]What the hell do you know?
[81:05.85]What about you?
[81:10.12]Wide eye.
[81:10.38]Okay.
[81:10.50]Who's that?
[81:10.88]There you are.
[81:11.24]Oh, this is the person I was just talking to.
[81:13.40]Somebody said, don't leave us with her.
[81:17.32]I'm fine.
[81:17.57]Not again.
[81:40.00]Tell me about Dunbrook Borough.
[81:41.44]Yes, a most unique place.
[81:44.15]Of course the Chalice would be there.
[81:46.89]Don't you see?
[81:48.01]It's the Elytra.
[81:49.35]They're the reason.
[81:52.01]What is this setup?
[81:54.57]A piece of shit.
[81:55.53]Those of you that weren't here before, I'll show it again.
[81:58.72]Card table.
[81:59.68]Monitor.
[82:17.77]Other monitor over on a chair.
[82:20.65]Folding chair.
[82:21.53]Computer down here.
[82:22.83]And then... In lap.
[82:26.75]Keyboard.
[82:27.53]And mouse on armchair.
[82:29.98]Yeah, I was able to scrounge up two monitors somehow.
[82:34.40]These are not coming with me.
[82:36.86]These are getting either donated or they're going to get put in a storage thing.
[82:41.34]Do a first person stream.
[82:50.13]It's a fire hazard?
[82:51.43]No, it's fine.
[82:53.99]We're fine.
[82:57.29]I mean, I did just get electrocuted.
[82:59.97]So, you might have a point, though.
[83:02.66]You actually have a point.
[83:08.00]Alright.
[83:11.20]Chalice of Reversal is locked away in Dunruh Burrow.
[83:13.48]I need to ingest Feldu to enter the burrow and pass through the reach to the chalice.
[83:21.11]So we've got to go through here.
[83:25.61]Where do I get the Feldu?
[83:26.47]So do I have to ask him?
[83:27.01]Is he going to give it to me?
[83:28.47]You don't have it.
[83:29.03]I just think it's in there.
[83:30.21]Alright, let's go.
[83:58.52]Mike is in the way.
[84:01.54]Don't hurt me.
[84:04.08]Alright, let's go.
[84:04.80]Can I fast travel?
[84:07.08]I cannot.
[84:07.76]Can I fast travel anywhere?
[84:11.35]No.
[84:12.39]I kind of just... I have to run.
[84:14.57]I have to run there.
[84:16.01]Great.
[84:20.43]Speak quickly, mortal.
[84:26.23]What kind of third-person action RPG skill point game is this?
[84:29.19]I need to sleep.
[84:30.33]Speaking of skill points.
[84:32.99]I need a bed.
[84:45.70]Blessing, citizen.

[86:06.69]Shitty personality.
[86:11.15]Fast to move, athletics, light armor, and acrobatics.
[86:15.67]I want Endurance.
[86:20.18]Only one point.
[86:21.54]Damn.
[86:28.12]I feel like I'm just missing out.
[86:35.83]Maybe intelligence?
[86:38.17]Yeah, I'm going to do intelligence.

[91:59.26]For a truly inspired blade, I can forge madness ore.
[92:04.52]Open your eyes.
[92:05.20]Let me check them.
[92:05.76]Hold on to this parchment.
[92:08.60]Okay.
[92:09.30]Forge weapon.
[92:10.90]Madness ore.
[92:11.62]Hold on.
[92:12.94]I have this now.
[92:17.62]Better than playing Oblivion and drinking mugroot beer.
[92:24.83]It's a supple and flexible ore.
[92:33.37]You can't chug soda, man.
[92:35.45]It doesn't work.
[92:38.19]You'll... It'll come back up in about five seconds.
[92:43.69]He's got a two liter.
[92:45.73]Yeah, man.
[92:47.62]It's only... Uh...
[92:52.59]4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.
[92:53.93]There's only 300 grams of sugar in here.
[93:00.13]That's not bad.
[93:01.75]You can burn that off in six weeks.
[93:08.79]I'm not going to chug this.
[93:10.82]We don't have any cups anymore.
[93:12.60]Don't you understand?
[93:13.32]I have nothing here.
[93:16.19]I don't even have cups or plates.
[93:18.95]It's McDonald's and mug root beer until October 6th.
[93:35.19]That hurts.
[93:35.87]Now why do people drink this?
[93:36.99]It hurts.
[93:41.50]Alright.
[93:41.90]Magical... What did she even say?
[93:44.74]Okay.
[93:46.45]Alright.
[93:48.11]Forge weapon.
[93:50.43]I want a bow.
[93:51.13]I want a war axe.
[93:51.77]I want a claymore.
[93:52.45]I want a sword.
[93:52.95]A war axe.
[93:53.59]Two pieces.
[93:55.97]That's it.
[93:57.49]Sword.
[93:58.95]Claymore.
[93:59.63]War axe.
[94:00.38]Bow.
[94:02.96]Make me a war axe.
[94:04.68]Could you... Lesser madness axe.
[94:16.29]What do you... Boots.
[94:18.56]Gauntlets.
[94:19.02]Greaves.
[94:19.56]Helmet.
[94:20.30]Magic Helmet.
[94:22.68]Magic Helmet.
[94:26.04]Oh, I just realized something.
[94:27.96]I don't have Streamlabs.
[94:30.30]I don't have my API or anything.
[94:31.88]Like, I don't have the browser source or anything on this computer.
[94:35.51]Someone just gave a bunch of money.
[94:38.91]Thank you, Frillidity.
[94:40.53]Hold on.
[94:42.29]That was a lot of money.
[94:42.91]That was like 50 fucking dollars.
[94:45.61]If you don't have anything, how are you streaming?
[94:47.03]I scrounged.
[94:47.63]I scrounged.
[94:49.49]I went to the bar.
[94:50.51]I lifted up the rug and I started scraping under the rug and I found a monitor.
[94:54.84]I opened up my closet and I took two or three items out.
[94:59.08]There was some clothes in there.
[95:00.12]There was a full 4770K CPU in there.
[95:03.72]And computer with a GTX 780 in there.
[95:09.22]All this shit was... This is like a Frankenstein monster here, man.
[95:14.31]But let me... Hold on a second.
[95:19.07]Let me just save it.
[95:20.61]Because I feel like I missed a couple of large donations.
[95:23.54]And I don't really... I don't mean to at all.
[95:28.62]Thank you, Frillidy, for the $50.
[95:31.72]Thanks for streaming while you're in the middle of moving.
[95:35.96]Yeah, I'm here, right?
[95:38.22]The only thing... It's going to be sporadic.
[95:40.00]And it's going to be erratic.
[95:40.96]And...
[95:43.94]After tonight, like, this was the night.
[95:45.62]This was the day that everything went down, essentially, over the last three days.
[95:51.01]So... This is gonna be a little more... It's gonna be cleaned up a little bit.
[95:57.99]Right?
[95:58.87]I'm still gonna use this mic, but I'll get another little table down here or something.
[96:05.07]We'll play God of War and shit.
[96:06.41]Like, there won't be that much of a difference after today's stream.
[96:10.97]So...
[96:13.15]Oh, there goes gravity.
[96:14.37]Yeah, that's right.
[96:14.81]But thank you so much for the $50.
[96:18.19]Really appreciate it.
[96:20.89]Do a painting.
[96:22.29]There's a few things that I'm going to do.
[96:27.27]But thank you so much.
[96:27.95]And I'm going to make sure I didn't miss any other large donations or anything.
[96:33.36]As I slowly burp into the microphone from that poison that I just consumed.
[96:39.04]Now, that's the only, like, large one.
[96:41.64]So, thank you so much, man.
[96:45.69]Let's go.
[96:48.01]When is the green screen stream?
[96:49.39]That's... That's happening like in like a week and a half.
[96:54.54]I had to get all my shit done first.
[96:56.80]And it's done.
[96:58.36]Now... Tomorrow's my birthday.
[97:01.32]And then the next day the house is being shown.
[97:04.88]So... I can't do anything the next two days.
[97:08.53]But we'll be back.
[97:09.43]To normal.
[97:10.93]After this week.
[97:12.70]So the only difference you're going to notice is this.
[97:16.38]And that's it.
[97:18.80]Let's get back to it.
[97:20.00]I want to make some armor or something.
[97:24.08]How the heck do I do that?
[97:27.17]I lost the chat.
[97:27.95]Shit.
[97:30.51]Why is there an Amazon link open right now?
[97:35.49]What the fuck does that even... Whatever.
[97:38.81]Alright.
[97:40.29]I do...
[97:43.03]Uh, forge armor.
[97:45.87]Let's just see what she does.
[97:50.37]And lesser madness curious added.
[97:53.42]Let's take a look.
[97:57.88]Can I upgrade these or do they stay the same?
[98:04.31]Holy shit.
[98:09.53]That's so much better than what I had on.
[98:14.01]Wow, that's much better.
[98:15.81]I was going to make the whole set.
[98:19.69]Fuck it.
[98:22.77]Let's sell.
[98:29.80]Look at that.
[98:31.26]Five damage?
[98:32.48]Yeah, sell this fucking thing.
[98:35.72]Oh, no, no, no.
[98:36.20]Haggle, haggle, haggle.
[98:37.12]Hold on.
[98:41.91]Sell the axe.
[98:43.63]I'm not going to use this.
[98:47.33]Somebody's going to be mad that I sell that, though.
[98:49.41]Staff of Flames, sell it.
[98:55.13]Sell these Grummet Arrows.
[99:00.12]Get rid of the Steel Curious.
[99:02.68]Don't sell it.
[99:03.38]Don't sell it.
[99:04.08]Don't sell it.
[99:04.98]I'm selling these, though.
[99:05.72]I'm just going to make the whole set.
[99:07.96]I have enough ore, don't I?
[99:09.64]I'm pretty sure I do.
[99:14.26]Steel boots.
[99:16.93]Steel gauntlets.
[99:18.09]Steel greaves.
[99:19.53]Steel helmet.
[99:20.97]Okay.
[99:24.27]Make me all cool stuff.
[99:25.85]Forge armor.
[99:26.65]Make me boots.
[99:32.54]Lesser madness.
[99:35.06]Make me gauntlets.
[99:41.72]Sounds good.
[99:43.12]Make me greaves.
[99:48.70]And make me a helmet.
[99:52.82]Oh, I can make a shield, too.
[99:58.51]Do I have enough to make a shield?
[100:03.19]Shit, I don't have any more.
[100:04.75]Oh, well.
[100:05.03]It's okay.
[100:05.33]I got everything else.
[100:10.49]Madness.
[100:11.31]Madness.
[100:12.19]Madness.
[100:13.03]Wow, that's so much better.
[100:13.95]Alright, now let's sell some of this other shit here.
[100:20.44]Because I have a lot of things I want to get rid of.
[100:24.70]Put on the madness axe.
[100:27.54]Pretty nice.
[100:28.14]I'm going to sell this.
[100:28.82]I'm not going to use it.
[100:31.28]It's great, but I'm not going to use it for anything.
[100:33.64]Yeah, just give it to me.
[100:43.21]Make sure I haggle with this.
[100:46.95]Now I'm a normal character.
[100:48.31]It's done.
[100:51.33]It's done.
[100:51.77]It's gone.
[100:52.29]Sorry, guys.
[100:53.05]Everyone's going to be really upset about that, but it's gone.
[101:04.46]Okay.
[101:06.80]That's all we can do.
[101:07.54]I got my stuff.
[101:09.07]And...
[101:13.67]Can you repair?
[101:15.59]Yeah, just repair all.
[101:25.08]Why would I need a Dusk Fang?
[101:26.18]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[101:29.86]Blunt is the only thing I took.
[101:31.72]Blunt and all the other awful things that I'm not even using.
[101:34.62]Alright, let's go.
[101:37.84]I actually look like a real character now.
[101:41.05]Sorry about bumping.
[101:44.86]So I still have to... I gotta find... I gotta go up here.
[101:47.41]So let's leave and take the road and I'm ready.
[101:50.57]I got a bunch of potions.
[101:54.27]Let's get the hell out of here.
[102:03.50]Here we go.
[102:03.74]Let's see what it looks like.
[102:08.08]That's kind of cool looking.
[102:12.09]That's really cool actually.
[102:15.39]Very nice indeed.
[102:18.35]Why no magic helmet?
[102:19.35]Because you need to use the matrix for that.
[102:22.77]I feel like I want to wait.
[102:27.15]Just take the road.
[102:30.02]Those are good graphics right there, don't you think?
[102:39.80]Yeah, don't you think?
[102:40.68]Don't you think those are good graphics?
[102:43.43]What's going on?
[102:45.16]That's why you were doing that?
[102:46.26]Sustenance.
[102:47.22]I'm holding it like a baby.
[102:49.04]You noticing that?
[102:49.59]I've got two hands on it.
[103:18.15]It's like a two-year-old.
[103:24.39]Shake it.
[103:25.13]Shake it up as hard as I can.
[103:26.13]Do you know what you should do?
[103:29.19]You should put, like, Mentos in there and shake it up.
[103:31.43]See what happens.
[103:33.29]It would hit the ceiling, and then I wouldn't be able to sell this house.
[103:36.38]But where would I sleep?
[103:38.00]I need some place.
[103:39.28]I've seen some people sleeping out on the street, but they huddle too close to the walls.
[103:43.52]I need some place safe.
[103:45.16]I can't just sleep anywhere.
[103:46.38]Shh.
[103:47.88]Can I let this guy sleep in my bed?
[103:50.86]I mean, when I'm not there, I mean.
[103:52.38]Outside.
[103:54.76]Sleep outside?
[103:56.00]Where am I supposed to do that?
[103:57.22]Hold on.
[103:57.42]Is that easy?
[103:57.95]Is that just right here?
[104:22.44]I guess it could be anywhere.
[104:24.30]Am I gonna get this guy killed?
[104:31.97]Is it safe over here?
[104:32.73]I have to find somebody sleeping outside.
[104:41.27]This looks safe.
[104:52.19]I just went through somebody's house to get all the way down here.
[104:55.18]What was the point of that?
[104:55.88]That guy sleeps outside, right?
[104:58.84]Sleep outside.
[105:00.24]Hmm.
[105:17.29]Oh, here's a notion for you.
[105:19.73]Ungor really gets on his nerves.
[105:22.27]You could kill or persuade himself to leave.
[105:26.06]Or kill somebody.
[105:27.74]Run him through.
[105:28.96]Or run him out, I mean.
[105:30.66]Yeah, get rid of him.
[105:32.94]Ungor's bed.
[105:33.82]Alright.
[105:39.55]So where's Ungor's bed?
[105:41.43]This way.
[105:55.41]Alright, let's go.
[106:02.55]Just cutting through.
[106:03.41]Don't mind me.
[106:03.81]I need your bed and you're gonna leave.
[106:18.60]It's just one more way they try to get me to get all special in the head, right?
[106:24.39]Make me sleep outside and everything.
[106:27.09]I don't belong here.
[106:28.25]This is the guy whose bed we need, right?
[106:30.55]What I would do for a warm bed.
[106:33.95]Soon I'll be leaving here.
[106:37.15]Switch beds.
[106:38.35]Why would he want to sleep in a bedroom and give me his bed?
[106:42.87]Sounds queer.
[106:44.59]I bet it's just another trick to get my head all twisted round.
[106:54.17]Sure, I don't trust you.
[106:55.09]Well, then I'm going to bury an axe in your head.
[106:57.33]So you're going to have to pick one.
[107:01.59]Oh, wait a minute.
[107:04.99]Hold on.
[107:05.47]Hold on a second here.
[107:06.23]That's pretty good.
[107:22.72]Really now, you're such a charmer.
[107:27.44]You're a big, fat liar.
[107:31.45]Is that so?
[107:33.49]We understand each other perfectly.
[107:42.33]That's just talk.
[107:45.93]Please, I'm embarrassed, but thank you.
[107:50.97]Yeah, I get it.
[107:53.86]Switch beds.
[107:54.98]Paying him to berate me.
[107:57.48]Yes.
[107:57.62]How do you not trust me?
[107:58.28]How?
[107:58.36]Disposition maxed.
[108:32.58]Get over here What
[109:02.77]I'm just being so silent.
[109:22.08]I'm trying so hard.
[109:34.48]Hi.
[109:35.38]I don't think this is going to kill him.
[109:41.91]He's just going to stub his toe from this.
[109:47.95]Is there another way to go up?
[109:49.75]There might be.
[109:57.69]If he dies from this, I'm going to fucking laugh my ass off.
[110:04.35]I think there is a way to go.
[110:06.68]Just don't fu- You- Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[110:12.74]You fucking just blew it, man.
[110:13.96]Give me a break.
[110:32.11]It's not like GTA.
[110:33.11]You can't just fucking shoot arrows at somebody.
[111:05.42]Why am I so slow?
[111:09.26]Why am I so slow?
[111:12.81]Why am I so slow?
[111:16.31]What?
[111:20.43]Oh, I had caps lock it.
[111:51.40]Can I hide?
[111:56.71]Why?
[111:56.97]Why am I doing that?
[111:58.41]This is not Grand Theft Auto!
[112:00.19]Stop doing this!
[112:02.72]Oh my... Wait.
[112:06.36]Wait, that's the guy!
[112:07.50]That's the guy!
[112:11.05]What?
[112:11.59]Oh, man.
[112:12.79]When did I save it?
[112:14.23]I don't remember.
[112:14.67]Oh, it's just boom power!
[112:35.17]I can't even talk to him.
[112:38.47]I'm just gonna die and... My brain.
[112:42.51]I'm sorry.
[112:43.15]I just fucking...
[113:22.57]Can I not kill this guy?
[113:43.80]Wait.
[113:44.80]I wanna surrender.
[113:45.76]I wanna surrender.
[113:48.33]Surrender!
[113:50.39]Surrender!
[113:50.93]I wanna surrender.
[113:53.84]Surrender!
[113:55.50]How do I surrender?
[113:59.88]Surrender!
[114:00.74]I surrender!
[114:02.52]I surrender!
[114:03.46]Who the fuck are you people?
[114:04.74]Space!
[114:05.50]I surrender!
[114:12.99]I surrender!
[114:26.94]For the best.
[114:27.60]Seriously.
[114:29.54]Block and... I did block and press spacebar.
[114:31.64]I blocked and... I had no option.
[114:38.89]Okay.
[114:39.53]Just make it fucking quick.
[114:40.77]Seriously.
[114:41.19]Just get me out of here.
[115:02.55]Don't get in my face like that.
[115:03.79]What are you doing here in jail?
[115:08.47]How do I get out of jail?
[115:12.13]Do I have to dig?
[115:38.08]Can I dig out of jail?
[115:50.05]Oh, you must sleep in a jail bed.
[115:54.93]Serve your time.
[116:06.87]No, no, no, no, no.
[116:07.65]What the fuck is this?
[116:19.91]If they never catch me, then we can do like a Roadrunner situation.
[116:32.06]I'll just never... I'll never get caught.
[116:39.35]Where they at?
[116:45.31]Where is this guy?
[116:55.16]God, he's too fast!
[116:56.10]Come on!
[116:59.26]Just pay the money.
[117:02.48]...as well as a criminal.
[117:04.14]Very well.
[117:05.32]Perhaps I'll have a chance.
[117:06.61]You'll come with me, and you'll be searched for.
[117:08.94]I don't have any stolen property.
[117:10.04]Alright, now fuck off.
[117:12.85]I'm good.
[117:13.15]I have all my stuff.
[117:21.13]120 is nothing.
[117:21.91]Yeah, I buried an axe in a guy's face over and over again in broad daylight.
[117:26.58]I had to pay a hundred bucks.
[117:28.40]Yeah, I had three or four zeros there.
[117:32.82]Alright, I gotta go this way.
[117:42.09]High roller.
[117:42.73]Didn't I just kill this guy?
[117:47.02]No.
[117:49.24]I'm looking for the... Yes, do it again.
[118:02.54]Can you perform?
[118:03.49]Perform.
[118:28.37]I can't help it.
[118:29.65]I can't help it.
[118:30.63]I can't do it.
[118:31.86]I'm not going to be able to walk by this road.
[118:34.14]Do you understand?
[118:34.66]I'm not going to be able to walk down the street.
[118:36.00]I had to look away in real life.
[118:42.36]There he is.
[118:42.68]I have.
[118:47.66]You found a place for me to sleep?
[118:49.52]Outside under the stars too small to fall and hurt me?
[118:52.24]Excellent.
[118:52.94]Excellent.
[118:53.76]Tell me more.
[118:56.04]Sleep in Ungar's bedroll.
[118:57.48]He's dead.
[118:58.08]I'm so sad.
[118:59.76]I hope he didn't die in his bedroll.
[119:01.38]Nope.
[119:01.82]Can't have that.
[119:03.14]Because that's where I'll be sleeping.
[119:04.76]That's right.
[119:05.82]But it's not at the bottom of a tall wall.
[119:08.24]So that means I can sleep without waking up under a pile of rubble.
[119:11.80]Or worse, waking up dead.
[119:16.83]Spell?
[119:17.17]Okay.
[119:17.73]What did I just get?
[119:19.37]Wait, was it a spell?
[119:20.01]It was a spell, I think.
[119:47.32]What a shitty reward, yeah.
[119:51.54]Fortify strength 100 points for 5 seconds.
[119:57.86]Holy shit.
[120:00.58]That's not... That's not what I got.
[120:04.32]Maybe it is.
[120:05.24]That thing's insane.
[120:09.29]But you could kill somebody in one hit.
[120:17.60]Listen, I want to test it.
[120:18.98]Just, I'm curious.
[120:29.98]This thing sucks!
[120:55.24]I must be insane.
[120:58.99]My weapons are still terrible, so the scaling just doesn't even matter.
[121:01.99]That makes sense.
[121:03.53]Alright, let's continue on.
[121:05.39]We have to go up here.
[121:08.81]Madness Ore.
[121:10.19]Chalice Reversal Log.
[121:11.07]There we go.
[121:11.43]This one.
[121:12.39]That's the one.
[121:12.91]I can't fast travel, so we gotta walk.
[121:15.95]Time to walk.
[121:19.07]Ugh.
[121:23.50]Never did I think I'd be sitting in this chair and be like, whoa, my back hurts.
[121:27.22]Let's see the beautiful area.
[121:32.35]Yay, walking.
[121:33.25]Yeah, you guys get to... Well, jumping, actually, because I need to level up.
[121:45.29]Now my fatigue is all gone.
[121:46.78]My endurance.
[121:47.26]Whatever the hell a green bar is.
[121:54.88]thing is pretty good actually.
[121:58.02]So what's like the most damaging weapon in the game?
[122:00.30]What was it?
[122:00.78]20?
[122:01.52]30?
[122:01.54]50?
[122:01.58]What does it cap out?
[122:03.89]32.
[122:09.03]Is it my birthday?
[122:16.95]Not yet.
[122:18.98]I'm probably gonna...
[122:24.75]So I'm going to have to take off here in about 30 to 40 minutes, just about an hour.
[122:39.52]Because it's going to be my birthday.
[122:45.99]and I'm doing something tomorrow but I think me and Kim we're gonna go like out later like to get like a late night dinner because that's gonna be the only opportunity we're gonna have but it is my birthday in just under three hours two and a half hours am I going the right way do I know what the hell I'm even doing
[123:15.38]I know that mask.
[123:21.00]Please stay on the roads.
[123:22.86]Said that person.
[123:25.50]But I don't listen.
[123:36.33]An early happy birthday to you.
[123:37.51]Thank you.
[123:38.73]Thanks, everybody.
[123:42.93]Well, that's why I should have listened.
[123:48.84]Yep.
[123:50.34]ET is my birthday.
[123:54.84]Happy 13th birthday.
[124:03.47]Oh, the big 5-0.
[124:05.71]Can you imagine when I turn 50?
[124:07.03]I'm closer to 50 than I am...
[124:17.47]Am I closer to 50 than I am to 18?
[124:20.37]That's kind of scary.
[124:22.73]Jesus.
[124:27.27]No.
[124:29.41]Almost there.
[124:30.87]I'm almost closer to 50 than I am to 18.
[124:32.35]I have 14 years for 18.
[124:37.31]So...
[124:41.79]Yeah, 17 years.
[124:43.41]That's not that far off, though.
[124:45.72]It's getting there.
[124:46.38]Let's go up Mount Chiliad.
[124:54.27]Damn it, I can't.
[125:32.96]This is not cheating.
[125:36.45]I mean, it's my birthday.
[125:37.87]I'm allowed to cheat once.
[125:40.11]That's my birthday.
[125:41.15]I didn't want to do that part.
[125:54.49]I get one.
[125:56.54]Alright, is it actually in here?
[125:58.25]Needs a key.
[126:00.83]Lock cannot be picked.
[126:01.75]I need a key.
[126:02.87]Did I not get a key?
[126:06.59]Or is there somebody up here that has one?
[126:09.92]This weird, like, crab monster?
[126:21.77]Need to ingest Feldu.
[126:27.83]Feldu.
[126:30.59]Where the fuck am I going to get Feldu?
[126:36.94]This is just the back entrance?
[126:39.42]Oh, is it really?
[126:44.28]Ingest.
[126:50.07]So therefore, is there another place to go around?
[126:52.07]I guess so.
[127:01.54]What's a fel do?
[127:07.68]Where are you?
[127:08.32]Right here?
[127:10.52]Am I falling?
[127:13.62]Oh, fucking Jesus Christ.
[127:43.90]Don't kill me.
[127:47.87]That's so annoying.
[127:49.43]I don't even waste this.
[127:59.14]I deserve it.
[127:59.60]If I lose, I deserve it.
[128:12.79]I almost deserved it.
[128:14.89]Almost.
[128:17.69]What's happening to me?
[128:18.63]Who is it?
[128:49.07]I feel like I'm playing Binding of Isaac with half a heart container left.
[129:01.07]There we go.
[129:01.41]Feldu.
[129:13.88]Up here.
[129:22.29]Hindem as your giant spore.
[129:25.45]That's a mouthful.
[129:31.47]Okay.
[129:33.21]Interesting looking... The membrane cannot be moved by hand.
[129:36.77]I have to eat the thing.
[129:41.37]Eat the raspberries.
[129:48.82]Feldu, where are you?
[129:51.88]It's bright and green.
[129:52.76]There it is.
[129:53.04]That was a little creepy.
[129:54.70]Don't eat them.
[129:55.04]Don't eat them.
[129:55.46]Well, I already did.
[129:56.00]So, no going back now.
[129:56.52]Are we still at 90?
[129:56.90]Yes, we are.
[130:21.03]I've noticed that if you hit them in their big bulbous ass, it's better.
[130:25.61]It does more damage.
[130:26.35]Or maybe I'm just crazy.
[130:28.97]I might be.
[130:37.19]I'm like turning my head this way.
[130:39.97]I can think of a better solution for the next stream on Monday.
[130:42.05]We're going to be playing... I'll get something else to make it so this is more comfortable.
[130:54.01]Do I have to keep eating the Feldu?
[130:58.98]That would suck if I do.
[131:01.08]That would be not fun.
[131:09.64]Monday?
[131:10.04]Yeah, so tomorrow's my birthday and then Sunday I cannot be in this house.
[131:15.11]Because it is being shown to, I believe, more than a few people.
[131:20.73]So I can't be here.
[131:22.85]I have to leave.
[131:24.75]I have to go find a place to sleep.
[131:28.50]Well, no, not really.
[131:29.76]The effects of Feldu have worn off and withdrawal is settling.
[131:31.70]I need to either reach the chalice or find more Feldu.
[131:34.74]Oh, I'm addicted to the Feldu now.
[131:45.01]Well, I have some more.
[131:46.21]Should I eat it or should I just try to get... No, let's eat it.
[131:50.75]Does that stay for the rest of the game?
[131:54.67]Veldu Euphoria added.
[131:55.97]Well, I have enough.
[132:00.62]I wonder if it'll last.
[132:05.64]Let's keep going.
[132:09.64]You find nothing.
[132:10.80]Nothing.
[132:18.52]Smoke him if you got him.
[132:34.33]Picking up, like, all the sneezes.
[132:44.01]Stop, stop, stop.
[132:45.59]What?
[132:48.56]What do you mean stop?
[132:51.48]Stop.
[132:57.58]Should I... Is there a problem?
[132:59.56]What happened?
[133:04.75]That's alright.
[133:05.25]I ate cheese.
[133:06.23]The effects of Feldu are counteracted by cheese.
[133:18.10]I think I have to eat another one.
[133:20.98]Stop!
[133:21.48]Don't eat anymore!
[133:23.80]Well, I'm going to eat.
[133:24.54]I have so much shit in here.
[133:33.38]Can I... I can brew the Felder into potions, can't I?
[133:39.21]Now that would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?
[133:40.69]Treasure Trust.
[133:48.09]Cool, gold nugget.
[133:52.41]So what's the end game here?
[134:02.09]Body begins to weaken from fell due withdrawal.
[134:04.59]Already?
[134:04.94]Am I going the right way?
[134:11.96]Where the hell is this?
[134:22.05]The Chalice of Reversal.
[134:25.95]I thought it would be underneath here.
[134:27.41]Should I not have done that?
[134:34.82]Probably not.
[134:38.64]I'm going all the way back now.
[134:40.94]God damn it.
[134:42.14]I shouldn't have fell off.
[134:42.90]I was just blindly following the arrow.
[134:46.02]I need to eat.
[134:51.33]Gimme Feldu.
[134:52.31]Gimme Feldu.
[134:53.13]I'm trying.
[134:58.98]Fuck.
[135:00.72]Well, I gotta put this away and run.
[135:04.76]Before I... Can't function anymore.
[135:15.05]Alright.
[135:15.47]This way.
[135:16.25]This way.
[135:16.89]Let's go this way.
[135:21.91]Wrap around.
[135:22.53]Alright, this is where I just was.
[135:24.09]And where is this thing that I need to touch or grab or use?
[135:34.06]Yeah, it's already here.
[135:34.82]Uh-oh, it's wearing off.
[135:37.62]Come on.
[135:38.32]Straight through here?
[135:41.06]Yep.
[135:43.84]Give me that feldu.
[135:44.50]Come on.
[135:45.42]I need it.
[135:52.31]What happens if I can't get it?
[135:55.41]Do I keel over or something?
[136:08.44]Somebody has to have it.
[136:09.20]Come on.
[136:13.66]Shit.
[136:17.65]There it is.
[136:23.58]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[136:25.42]Alright, I'm good.
[136:30.22]I just took it.
[136:30.90]I just had some.
[136:35.05]I just had it.
[136:36.41]I just took it.
[136:47.75]Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[136:50.21]That's correct.
[136:51.15]Alright.
[136:52.80]How do people wear headphones?
[136:55.42]Because right now, my ears hurt.
[136:57.74]If I go like this... Ow!
[136:59.44]Ouch!
[136:59.66]I guess maybe that's because I have an $8 Walmart brand on.
[137:13.33]Oh, shit.
[137:14.15]Really?
[137:17.75]Painful addiction withdrawal.
[137:19.85]God.
[137:25.36]Give me what I'm looking for here.
[137:26.60]Yeah, that's better.
[137:44.05]Can you guys still hear me?
[137:45.19]Is this too low?
[137:50.59]I'm gonna go that way.
[137:55.99]Move the mic a little closer.
[137:59.17]How's that?
[138:00.46]I don't even know if I did.
[138:10.62]Potion of grace.
[138:11.83]Cool.
[138:15.37]Still got a little ways to go.
[138:16.53]Is that gas?
[138:25.51]I don't know what the hell that is.
[138:30.47]So I gotta go down.
[138:32.53]Into the swamp.
[138:41.30]What am I looking for?
[138:42.02]A certain crystal or something, right?
[138:51.97]The bugs are a cool enemy.
[138:52.93]I like the bugs a little.
[138:54.67]A little.
[138:55.79]Just enough.
[138:56.29]Just barely enough.
[139:03.53]Chalice.
[139:03.97]Right.
[139:04.17]Okay.
[139:05.57]Just making sure.
[139:09.71]That I know what the hell I'm doing.
[139:16.04]These look like plants I wouldn't want to touch.
[139:17.66]I feel like my hands would get really itchy if I touched these for more than a second.
[139:27.18]Oh, fuck off.
[139:30.82]Anybody more of that shit on you?
[139:33.02]Oh, my back!
[139:39.01]Well, I'll have a lot of these.
[139:39.97]These give health.
[139:43.55]Part of one of the recipes.
[139:46.47]This is going to just keep dropping, isn't it?
[139:49.11]Do I have any...
[140:02.94]Which way are we going?
[140:06.96]I don't know.
[140:09.32]This way, apparently.
[140:12.20]I wonder if I can get her through here.
[140:23.45]There it is.
[140:25.01]So something that... Did you actually walk around and kill stuff in dungeons in Skyrim?
[140:32.88]Part of my brain remembers that this kind of stuff was... Not a, uh... It was?
[140:45.98]I don't remember it being...
[140:49.60]No, that's not even... I'm speaking through such ignorance right now.
[140:53.80]Like I told you, I played the game for like 12 minutes and then turned everybody into mutants.
[140:58.11]That's why I didn't want to do that with this one.
[140:59.49]I wanted to at least play it for 10 hours or so.
[141:03.23]Before we ruin it.
[141:04.03]Ooh.
[141:05.89]That's nice.
[141:09.30]Seastride, Tome, Soul Gem, and Gold.
[141:16.89]When are you going to play Skyrim?
[141:20.95]Probably won't.
[141:22.37]I have ruined that game for me so long ago.
[141:24.37]I just can't ever do it again.
[141:25.69]I would want to turn everybody into turkeys again.
[141:31.64]Go down so we can go all the way around.
[141:33.86]Bogus.
[141:34.86]Bogus.
[141:41.52]Already got all this shit.
[141:44.23]Let me spin around this way.
[141:46.66]I'm going to lean back.
[141:51.17]I'm going to lie down on the fucking bed.
[141:53.01]I'm just going to put a bed down here.
[141:57.75]Would that maybe be different?
[142:00.33]If I played every game from bed?
[142:04.79]Speaking of bed.
[142:05.85]I'm like about to fall asleep.
[142:07.91]Why?
[142:08.29]I was just so full of energy.
[142:10.85]I had so much fucking energy.
[142:13.09]And now I'm like.
[142:17.03]Just total fucking... My body's just out of control.
[142:20.39]Alright, I'm going the wrong way.
[142:21.70]I'm going down this way.
[142:30.48]Root beer crash.
[142:33.47]Fucking... See, that stuff is crap.
[142:38.33]Fucking root beer crash, man.
[142:40.49]I'm never drinking soda again.
[142:44.17]I'm just fading.
[142:51.70]What happened?
[142:53.62]What the fuck was that?
[142:55.88]Alright, I gotta go across.
[142:58.29]How do I get over there?
[143:04.41]Over here.
[143:08.91]Fucking root beer.
[143:19.88]Up and around.
[143:26.05]I'm like... I think I can go this way.
[143:34.27]No, what?
[143:37.19]I just scratched my head to think.
[143:47.14]What if I wait it off?
[144:02.62]Like, I can't get up this way.
[144:04.20]How the fuck do I get over here?
[144:05.18]Every time I come down here, it's just not correct.
[144:14.85]This other way?
[144:15.51]I mean, there's only one way to go, that's true, but... I keep hitting a wall.
[144:28.78]Because he can't go this way.
[144:31.02]So do I have to go this way and then wrap around?
[144:36.62]He's too tired to read maps.
[144:40.79]No, I can see it.
[144:42.67]I can see it.
[144:49.23]What's wrong with me?
[144:55.11]What?
[144:55.47]This is affecting me in real life, too.
[144:58.71]I'm feeling like this now.
[145:01.27]Did I do these shrugs?
[145:02.69]When did I do this?
[145:03.55]I'm over-encumbered.
[145:10.90]Just eat.
[145:13.22]Eat it away.
[145:16.52]Dispel magic.
[145:22.70]Should I drink this lady's crying?
[145:44.14]Where's the spell?
[145:51.02]I just had it up here.
[145:55.18]Fuck.
[146:00.61]I need to get rid of stuff, but I don't have anything to get rid of.
[146:03.83]What about the steel shield?
[146:08.39]Seven.
[146:08.81]No.
[146:09.29]It's still better.
[146:11.97]Ten light for this, though.
[146:14.54]Just eat the bread?
[146:15.38]Just sit here and just gnaw on bread.
[146:19.34]227, onion.
[146:22.98]It's my birthday?
[146:38.10]No, it's not.
[146:44.30]I need something that just weighs... This weighs five.
[146:46.27]I can't throw that away.
[146:50.55]Eat heavy things.
[146:54.39]A little bit of arrows.
[146:55.39]No.
[146:56.11]I'm not going to eat the arrows.
[146:57.16]Restore health.
[147:06.18]Heart of order.
[147:06.86]Restore endurance.
[147:10.71]Detect life.
[147:13.02]Drain fatigue, drain health.
[147:22.32]Who fucking cares?
[147:23.09]Let's go.
[147:32.27]Why would you do that?
[147:34.49]Because I... I needed to... I don't know.
[147:39.18]We have drastic times for crass speaking, you know what I mean?
[147:45.70]There it is.
[147:49.26]Big money.
[147:50.60]Did big money come in, really?
[147:51.50]Alright, once I get to the end of this, I will take a look.
[148:00.21]I just have no stream labs.
[148:04.51]Crippling Feldu withdrawal.
[148:06.05]I need some... Please, Feldu.
[148:08.84]Where are you?
[148:10.62]I don't even go down the right tube.
[148:19.11]I'm over income.
[148:20.03]Fuck.
[148:36.67]Shit!
[148:49.27]He's bathing in root beer.
[148:50.57]What the fuck is this?
[149:00.92]What is all this shit?
[149:02.50]Why do I have this?
[149:26.60]Alright.
[149:27.48]This way.
[149:28.50]Take a right.
[149:33.48]Now, this is one of those things that you do because you think it's a good idea.
[149:37.62]Man, I'll just be able to stretch out and lean back and have my keyboard in my... No, I'm not.
[149:48.99]Oh.
[150:07.09]I need to.
[150:19.25]Is there like restore strength?
[150:22.45]Restore endurance, right?
[150:40.53]Alright, come on.
[150:42.19]Come on.
[150:42.97]Restore it.
[150:46.81]Restore the endurance.
[151:00.61]Resist fire?
[151:01.51]Resist frost?
[151:02.15]Resist shock?
[151:07.03]What did it just do?
[151:17.13]Charity of Madness lets me carry more stuff.
[151:21.46]How?
[151:36.29]Feather?
[151:38.81]There we go.
[151:40.69]You guys said the wrong one.
[151:41.77]It's that one.
[151:42.25]It's Feather.
[151:48.28]Everybody's screaming at me to put the madness one on, and it was the feather one.
[151:52.04]Okay.
[151:54.42]Restore strength.
[151:59.48]Give it to me.
[152:01.42]Alright, now I can just throw some bread on the ground.
[152:04.42]I have to eat one of these now.
[152:13.79]Come on!
[152:16.41]Why?
[152:18.98]I've just been standing here.
[152:27.86]What about the shield?
[152:32.25]Drop some of the useless potions?
[152:37.97]What the fuck was that?
[152:38.79]Okay, let's go.
[152:46.46]Straight ahead.
[152:48.72]Turn right.
[152:49.08]Alright.
[152:51.48]Give it to me.
[152:51.96]I know you got one on you.
[152:54.35]There it is.
[152:55.09]Eat it.
[153:00.60]Oh, there we go.
[153:03.20]I feel so much better.
[153:06.94]Wrong way.
[153:16.79]I wish I still had my TV.
[153:18.27]I would just put it down here.
[153:19.31]Alright.
[153:33.16]This has got to be the end.
[153:34.20]This is probably the last one.
[153:37.76]Alright, so I've got to sit up for this.
[153:38.99]Oh my god.
[153:42.65]I'm just going to shit my pants right there.
[153:53.53]Iron Greaves?
[153:54.21]No.
[154:00.31]Uh, what?
[154:02.81]What is it?
[154:03.17]What's the matter?
[154:10.81]I'm just following this.
[154:12.41]I don't have time for this.
[154:13.97]I'm going to get over-encumbered again.
[154:23.00]I'm gonna probably say they're gonna bait you here and it's up this way.
[154:27.51]I'm gonna assume.
[154:33.91]Take it.
[154:42.19]What?
[154:43.43]What just hurt me?
[154:51.08]I was right the right... Oh, I was right the whole time.
[154:55.83]Should have just gone straight.
[154:56.77]What the hell was I thinking?
[155:03.68]There's the door.
[155:08.64]You didn't have it on you.
[155:11.12]Not cool.
[155:17.68]Can't go that way.
[155:18.74]Wrap around.
[155:21.52]Oof.
[155:30.72]Your endurance will bear.
[155:31.76]Yeah, they're all weakened.
[155:32.66]That's fine.
[155:35.14]Not in trouble yet.
[155:38.06]Probably going to go down and around.
[155:40.41]I would assume.
[155:41.31]If you can't go over it, go around it.
[155:54.43]That's true.
[155:56.49]Speaking of which.
[156:02.37]Damn, this is going to wrap me all the way around.
[156:08.75]Shit.
[156:10.03]Wait.
[156:12.05]Wallace Ruby.
[156:13.60]That seems kind of good.
[156:18.88]Nobody.
[156:19.24]What's the drop rate on these?
[156:20.32]Fucking 2%.
[156:31.88]How do I keep getting further away from the camera?
[156:35.86]I don't know.
[156:37.14]I'm like leaning back.
[156:38.54]I should just take those right now.
[156:47.63]They just keep disappearing.
[156:55.54]I don't know what I just did.
[156:57.52]I just tried to get rid of potions.
[157:01.43]Alright, this is the way.
[157:02.07]This is going to take me all the way around.
[157:14.36]I have a lot of those ichors.
[157:18.54]I don't know what to do with them.
[157:31.86]Water Breathing Tome.
[157:35.68]Alright, well, this has got to be almost there.
[157:40.06]Come on.
[157:40.58]Both of you guys should have one.
[157:44.27]Have one.
[157:47.85]Bullshit.
[157:49.37]Fuck.
[157:53.99]Thank god.
[157:54.79]Alright.
[157:55.71]Eat it.
[158:02.79]Read the tome?
[158:05.19]Okay.
[158:11.20]I don't know which one was it.
[158:17.90]I just stole it.
[158:19.44]Breathe water for 15 seconds?
[158:24.80]Only the glowy ones had dew?
[158:27.53]Just read them all?
[158:38.29]Do you want to add this to your spell list?
[158:39.57]Yeah.
[158:42.65]Link.
[158:43.73]Already got that listed.
[158:46.07]Sea stride.
[158:46.61]Would you like to add sea stride?
[158:47.87]Yes, I would.
[158:54.97]The warp in the west.
[158:56.55]My block skill has increased.
[158:58.21]Oh, that's cool.
[159:00.41]Oh, I didn't know this did this.
[159:02.95]That's kind of good.
[159:04.42]That's kind of good.
[159:08.28]Read the note.
[159:09.90]I haven't read any of this stuff.
[159:11.20]What am I, stupid?
[159:18.31]Charm.
[159:28.47]Is my axe broken?
[159:29.31]That would explain this.
[159:45.27]I don't think I have any repair hammers either.
[159:46.63]I need to stand still.
[160:00.88]Why can't we just be friends with the bugs?
[160:03.01]That's a good question.
[160:09.89]This is probably the last one.
[160:11.25]Anyway, I've survived Dunraboro.
[160:12.99]Now I need to search the tower above for the Chalice of Reversal.
[160:20.62]Search the Chalice.
[160:22.10]Well... Do you have a cure for Feldua?
[160:26.26]Who the hell are these people?
[160:29.10]Oh, it's a fellow addict.
[160:32.55]This is not hurting anyone.
[161:02.87]Get out!
[161:04.47]Why can't I hurt anybody?
[161:09.71]Do I not have any repair things?
[161:19.78]Thank God.
[161:21.90]I can't when there's enemies nearby.
[161:24.60]Well, there it is.
[161:28.66]There it is.
[161:29.14]I have the chalice.
[161:29.92]It should be delivered...
[161:32.73]Oh, see you later.
[161:33.41]What do you got?
[161:33.95]Rubies and shit?
[161:36.33]What?
[161:39.36]What am I doing?
[161:41.38]What is going on?
[161:42.34]Why would I do that?
[161:44.98]Alright, get me out of here.
[161:51.39]Yeah, fuck it.
[161:51.89]I'm out.
[161:52.53]I'm up to kill one of these guys.
[162:08.92]Oh, they fucking follow me.
[162:11.68]I can level up.
[162:19.41]Get in.
[162:22.87]Hold on.
[162:24.23]Can I... Wrong way.
[162:29.96]I'm trying to go the right way.
[162:42.42]So I can go this way, and then down here.
[162:51.78]I'm trying to get out.
[162:55.62]Down to the right.
[162:56.84]I get it.
[162:58.97]I thought I had to run all the way back, the entire way.
[163:01.19]Alright, we're good.
[163:10.64]They don't still follow me, do they?
[163:12.46]What am I supposed to do about these people?
[163:18.49]Can I fast travel here?
[163:24.79]What the fuck is that?
[163:26.13]Is this guy on my team?
[163:35.98]This guy's on my team.
[163:39.91]Alright, come on.
[163:40.61]Let's go, Shredder.
[163:46.99]Oh wait, no, these are... I wish you people would fucking turn around.
[163:55.87]Who's making the T-Rex noise?
[164:10.40]Can we fucking stop?
[164:13.57]Will you die?
[164:16.53]Kill him!
[164:28.74]They're just coming out of the portal.
[164:30.16]These guys just don't die.
[164:40.87]These guys just do not die.
[164:42.48]I just killed the sorcerer.
[164:57.60]I just killed them all.
[165:00.40]These people are impossible to kill.
[165:10.34]Why is there a ghost?
[165:12.44]What happened to my weapon?
[165:15.92]I'm getting extreme deja vu.
[165:18.22]Did this happen?
[165:20.89]Did I play this game?
[165:22.19]The same scenario played out.
[165:23.97]When?
[165:27.41]When did this happen?
[165:40.03]Alright, I'm out of here.
[165:42.55]Where's my horse?
[165:44.91]No, this exact scenario.
[165:47.18]I don't know what happened and why, but... Something like this.
[165:52.00]Something happened.
[165:55.20]And it wasn't this game.
[166:03.49]It's my birthday.
[166:07.31]It's my birthday.
[166:07.93]I get to do it.
[166:25.16]Is he still hitting me?
[166:26.06]Alright, I can't even walk forward.
[166:33.42]She's dead.
[166:33.74]These guys died.
[166:56.40]What?
[166:58.20]What?
[166:58.98]What happened?
[166:59.88]Why am I getting shocked?
[167:00.96]Alright, I can't touch that guy.
[167:09.90]Alright, just put the collision back on and fast travel.
[167:15.27]Okay.
[167:16.13]TCL.
[167:18.39]We're good.
[167:19.23]Fast travel.
[167:21.25]Turn it in.
[167:25.33]Get out.
[167:25.89]Get out.
[167:26.51]Get out.
[167:27.05]Get out.
[167:27.61]Get out.
[167:28.11]Alright, we're going to turn this in and then I'm going to go to birthday dinner.
[167:34.25]And I don't know why I'm looking at the camera and I'm addressing you directly.
[167:36.81]Because I need to make sure you know that shit.
[167:46.50]She's like already up there getting riled up.
[167:49.10]She's all riled up up there.
[167:52.92]Alright, what do you got for me?
[167:54.56]They were telling you to get out when you were outside.
[168:02.99]Get the fuck out of here!
[168:04.27]Well they're all like drugs.
[168:05.05]And so am I. So wait, is he making fun of me now?
[168:18.46]I'll just take that back from you.
[168:21.04]Wait, what?
[168:22.20]And as a token of my gratitude, I grant you the role of Courtier of Mania.
[168:28.18]Is he going to cure my addiction here?
[168:32.26]Which is to say, no.
[168:34.06]What am I doing here?
[168:36.34]What?
[168:38.34]Wait, I don't get anything.
[168:39.38]What?
[168:40.18]What is it?
[168:42.43]Wonderful to have it back, really.
[168:48.53]You got me addicted to drugs and you didn't even give me a reward.
[168:51.82]I'm taking your fucking bread.
[168:55.86]Might be the perfect opportunity.
[169:01.24]I can't even take it.
[169:02.91]Well, that was annoying.
[169:04.41]That's okay.
[169:05.11]I guess that happened.
[169:12.07]Well, I'm going to save it here.
[169:13.71]Why does everybody look so weird?
[169:17.76]Is this because I'm addicted to this drug?
[169:21.00]Tell him to get out.
[169:21.97]Put this down here for a second.
[169:27.33]Alright.
[169:29.41]You never read the... Oh, fuck, you're right.
[169:31.81]I never did read that.
[169:34.21]Let's just quit out of this.
[169:38.22]It's saved, so we're good.
[169:45.26]That's how they look.
[169:45.86]They have...
[169:47.58]little glowing orbs around them alright uh thank you for sticking around a little bit shorter than usual but I mean I I need to like get this set up better but everything's gone everything's packed oh right we're quiet here I'll help there say that we're gonna use I'm talking into this microphone so we're gonna use it now
[170:17.03]Everything's packed up.
[170:19.47]So I'm good to go.
[170:20.47]I just have to wait till it gets to Las Vegas.
[170:22.39]I already have my itinerary ready to go.
[170:27.43]So thank you, everybody.
[170:31.50]Bear with me.
[170:32.06]Here are these next seven or eight days.
[170:35.92]It's not that I'm not going to stream.
[170:37.02]It's just streams are going to be a little more erratic.
[170:40.41]So it's my birthday.
[170:47.46]Man, any time somebody tells you it's their birthday and they look at you, they're really looking for you to be like, oh, happy birthday, man.
[170:55.36]And you're like, yeah, I could have said that earlier.
[171:05.01]I don't even like this.
[171:05.83]I don't know why I'm drinking it.
[171:10.27]Yeah, you better say happy birthday.
[171:13.49]No, I'm too old to give a shit about birthdays.
[171:16.62]Just gets to a point where you're like, yeah, it happened.
[171:20.58]It's a thing.
[171:21.50]It happened.
[171:21.90]It's done.
[171:24.94]But, thank you.
[171:26.86]And with that, we're going to do the bits and the credits.
[171:30.94]I'm going to roll them.
[171:32.23]I will see you guys on Monday.
[171:35.09]And by Monday, I'm going to kind of have this into the corner here with a little bit better of a setup.
[171:42.87]I'm going to get a place where my keyboard and mouse can just go so I'm not
[171:46.35]Leaning back with shit.
[171:49.07]And we'll go from there.
[171:52.46]Wait, what the hell was that?
[171:54.12]Holy... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[171:56.06]Did somebody just give a shitload of community subs?
[172:00.28]Alright, let's get to the... Somebody gave 10 community subs?
[172:04.86]Jesus.
[172:06.74]Uh, ya boy, thank you for the 10 community subs from ya boy.
[172:12.80]Community birthday subscriptions.
[172:14.96]Thank you, man.
[172:16.50]That means a lot.
[172:19.48]That's a big drop for subscriptions here.
[172:22.64]And also, somebody gave $50 earlier, and I want to touch upon it.
[172:26.34]It went through my brain, and it's, you know, I hate missing large fucking donations like that.
[172:33.89]But Cats Beanie, thanks for the $50, Cats Beanie.
[172:37.73]We share the same birthday, so happy birthday to us.
[172:41.18]Hey, look at that.
[172:42.32]Happy birthday, Cats Beanie.
[172:44.80]Hope you have a good one.
[172:48.42]I'm gonna be going through all this stuff.
[172:51.98]Here's the thing, like streamer setup.
[172:54.30]Hey man, yeah, I got, look at that, cool.
[172:56.66]I got a little backdrop here and I got a webcam on.
[173:00.72]It's not like if I turn the camera like over here, there's a bunch of fucking trash.
[173:09.61]Yep.
[173:13.55]It's still happening.
[173:15.57]That's not, look, I had to like,
[173:19.06]I had to detonate my whole house to fucking find everything I wanted to bring to Las Vegas.
[173:24.39]So, that's nothing.
[173:25.87]You should see what the upstairs looks like.
[173:27.99]So now everything has to be cleaned up, has to be taken care of, and gone through.
[173:33.33]Which is gonna take another four or five days.
[173:37.53]But the hard part is done.
[173:40.78]Show us.
[173:41.18]I don't want you to see my, like, garbage.
[173:46.26]No, nobody wants somebody looking in their trash.
[173:49.52]I know from experience.
[173:53.48]But... We both have a good one.
[174:03.27]But, yeah, those of you that are leaving now, I'll see you Monday.
[174:09.37]Trying to get as many streams as I can in before I leave.
[174:13.11]Much love to you if you've taken off.
[174:14.21]I'll see you soon.
[174:15.05]Have a great weekend if I don't see you, which I probably won't.
[174:18.26]Maybe I'll be on Twitter.
[174:20.14]It's possible, but can you hear that?
[174:34.08]That's like, that's Otto.
[174:36.48]That's Otto sprinting around upstairs.
[174:41.77]He's just running around.
[174:44.11]Well, I don't know why he's doing that.
[174:45.29]I think that he must be excited.
[174:47.71]That's how Kim's like running around.
[174:51.02]She's trying to get exercise in.
[174:53.72]But anyways, let's do the credits.
[174:55.64]I'm gonna get off the screen for a moment.
[174:58.44]Like this.
[175:01.09]Oh.
[175:07.69]I don't have that, because it's not the same computer.
[175:11.77]Hold on.
[175:18.99]Hold on a second.
[175:22.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[175:23.24]I think I might really get it.
[175:29.00]Yeah, I got it.
[175:32.84]This should work.
[175:37.16]This should.
[175:38.26]I mean, should is the correct answer here.
[175:44.16]I think I just have to do this.
[175:50.70]Did it work?
[175:57.80]I don't think it worked.
[176:09.01]Why am I holding the muted mic?
[176:20.69]I don't fucking know.
[176:23.45]That's a great question.
[176:29.08]It's been a long few days.
[176:33.71]Why can't I... I'm not sure I can get this to do this right now.
[176:46.99]This should work.
[176:47.73]I don't know why.
[176:48.44]Hold on.
[176:52.48]Is it because it's not... What happens if I run it?
[176:55.72]It's on here right now.
[176:57.18]What happens if I just run it?
[177:00.51]Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey.
[177:03.31]Thanks, all these people.
[177:05.65]Hold on.
[177:08.79]This is, like, cooler than it is on my other computer.
[177:20.02]Thank you, guys.
[177:22.90]Thank you, all these people.
[177:25.81]We're talking about Tidal, Spanch, Phil.
[177:30.39]Paradox.
[177:32.11]That guy.
[177:34.59]I can't even read it.
[177:38.19]Hopefully this is correct.
[177:39.03]This is not from a few days ago, right?
[177:46.36]Anime credits?
[177:48.50]Should I be back here spinning around or something?
[177:58.54]No, thank you everybody.
[178:02.73]Uh, it's from this stream.
[178:03.80]I saw my name.
[178:04.52]Good.
[178:06.56]You're all wonderful fucking people.
[178:10.14]Thank you.
[178:11.30]I should do a dance here.
[178:18.99]Hold on, ready?
[178:20.57]I got these long pajamas on.
[178:22.15]Yes, I've been wearing pajamas all day.
[178:23.61]I've been wearing pajamas for all week.
[178:26.59]No, that's, my pants are gonna come off.
[178:27.84]I'm not doing that.
[178:30.90]Play anime.
[178:31.78]No, I gotta pay attention to this because these are the people that are fucking here that are subbing to the stream.
[178:37.62]So, I want to see their names.
[178:39.50]It's important.
[178:43.74]If you're moving, you have an excuse.
[178:45.82]That's true.
[178:46.44]All my clothes, too.
[178:48.12]So, don't be surprised, everybody, if I'm in the same outfit on Monday because all of my clothes are gone, too.
[178:58.87]They're all gone.
[179:02.57]There's a lot of fucking subs tonight.
[179:05.45]Let me get in the right spot so I can see them.
[179:08.93]Mm-hmm.
[179:11.82]That's right.
[179:12.62]Look at these.
[179:16.28]Jesus.
[179:18.98]Another like 100 to 200 fucking sub night.
[179:23.71]You guys are too much.
[179:27.77]Where am I moving?
[179:28.45]Las Vegas.
[179:30.35]Las Vegas, Nevada.
[179:32.89]The place to be.
[179:33.83]Let me see where... Holy shit, there's a lot of people.
[179:41.42]I don't know if it's like stretched out or... Why am I squatting in this person's house?
[179:48.43]It's my house.
[179:54.39]Thank you, all you guys.
[179:55.71]For real.
[179:58.73]It's Nevada.
[180:01.98]I know, I'm trying to get it.
[180:04.89]But yeah, that's a shitload of subs, guys.
[180:09.23]I just hope you bear with me here over these next few weeks.
[180:11.23]And I know you already have been.
[180:12.39]Everybody's been so patient.
[180:15.31]Everybody's been so supportive and so nice and so... I just... Thank you.
[180:22.55]It's been pretty rough.
[180:23.87]It's been kind of ridiculous.
[180:25.17]There's a few stories that maybe you'll hear one day about just how fucking strange this whole ordeal was.
[180:32.53]But
[180:34.57]Thank you guys.
[180:36.21]And with that, we're gonna get to the bits.
[180:37.41]We're gonna do the bits fairly quickly.
[180:39.31]I say that every time, but I mean that very much so.
[180:43.46]So I'm gonna go like this.
[180:44.76]Actually, no, I'm not because I don't even have a fucking outro.
[180:49.34]So let me, I gotta pee real bad.
[180:51.86]So let me pee and I'll come right back and we'll do the bits.
[180:55.72]I'll be right back.
[183:37.67]I'm back.
[183:42.99]Let's go back to here.
[183:44.23]Oh, look, there's a person.
[183:46.41]Alright, let's do the bits.
[183:49.36]Make sure I can see that.
[183:52.52]And I can.
[183:56.20]Good.
[183:58.22]Let me put the chat over here, too.
[184:03.14]Out of breath from peeing?
[184:04.08]No, out of breath from...
[184:07.42]Now you'll be alright.
[184:09.04]But like I had to run up the stairs and run down the stairs.
[184:12.26]I'm not out of breath.
[184:14.60]I'm fine.
[184:15.00]I'm good to go.
[184:18.14]Alright.
[184:18.42]So is this like a new dashboard or have I just been on an old outdated dashboard for like a year and a half?
[184:28.61]Probably.
[184:30.21]But let's go back to the beginning here.
[184:35.53]These are implants.
[184:38.05]Don't give away my fucking secrets, man.
[184:39.57]Alright, we're going to rapid-fy these bits because I have to go before we have to go eat before they close.
[184:48.27]There's a certain restaurant that closes at like 1 a.m.
[184:50.99]So I'm going to go through these very quickly.
[184:52.55]And we're going to start with Jeff with a PH.
[184:56.57]Thanks for the $1, Jeff.
[184:59.73]2005 Stream.
[185:01.95]2005 Steam.
[185:05.07]That's a cool, isn't that a cool door?
[185:08.08]If you just came in, you've never seen that door.
[185:09.84]We're going to McDonald's.
[185:12.36]No, not tonight.
[185:12.96]It's birthday.
[185:15.05]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[185:16.61]Hey, Jerma, it's the 21st night of September.

[185:20.59]We can just play the first five seconds.
[185:28.54]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers, for the $1.
[185:29.88]If you haven't made an Earth, wind, and fire joke by the time you read this, then my disappointment is immeasurable.
[185:37.57]Well, it's funny that you say that.
[185:49.26]That's probably really loud.
[185:50.02]I'm sorry.
[185:51.52]But there you go, Superintendent Chalmers.
[185:54.08]Pocket falling, thanks for the $1.
[185:56.74]Use all the mics.
[185:58.44]I turned them on at one.
[185:59.74]I don't want to, like, hurt anybody.
[186:00.96]Those mics are so shitty and old.
[186:03.66]You could actually, like, if you do it too loud.
[186:07.65]Mr. Kool-Aid, thanks for the $5, Mr. Kool-Aid.
[186:09.17]This is the worst ASMR I've ever experienced.

[186:30.95]I think that's more of a compliment.
[186:31.99]2001 YouTube quality was pretty cool.
[186:34.91]2001 was a pretty great year for YouTube.
[186:36.87]It was when
[186:39.63]Wait, YouTube didn't even come out until like 2005.
[186:40.95]What are you talking about?
[186:44.63]YouTube launched in like 2006.
[186:46.34]It wasn't even real.
[186:49.42]You're making shit up.
[186:51.22]But thank you, Metal Socks, for the 15 bucks.
[186:53.40]Appreciate it, man.

[190:02.35]No, I actually fell down the stairs in the video.
[190:10.93]Yeah, just times that by like 200%.

[190:44.28]Freckster, thanks for the $1.
[190:45.42]Happy birthday.
[190:45.94]It's illegal to read this before your birthday.
[190:49.98]I'm going straight to fucking jail.
[190:52.41]Thanks, man.
[190:54.97]I just feel like flipping downstairs is making me want to burp.
[190:58.31]I just jumbled around all the shit in my stomach and it wanted to come out.
[191:02.13]Ugh.
[191:03.61]I'm like, it's like still happening.
[191:05.77]That's a delayed reaction.
[191:06.95]Holy shit.
[191:10.64]What if I just puked right into the camera?
[191:16.32]Mug.
[191:16.60]It was the mug.
[191:17.32]No, what am I talking about?
[191:18.42]I just drank the root beer.
[191:19.79]It has nothing to do with falling down the stairs.
[191:22.65]It's everything to do with it.
[191:23.45]I just drank a chug sip of that fucking dumb poison that's underneath my legs.
[191:30.77]But thank you, HoleofOneZombie and Frexter.
[191:33.21]Thank you, ZeroSue, for the $3.30.
[191:36.12]Happy birthday, you 33-year-old boomer.
[191:39.46]In all seriousness, good luck on the move, and I hope all your stuff turns out alright.
[191:43.12]I have the same anxiety issues sometimes when I think about all the stuff that I have that's not in my direct possession.
[191:48.62]It's why I try to keep all my possessions to a minimum and have plenty of money to replace things that I currently have that got you back as the Jerm of rat force.
[191:58.91]Yeah, it's stressful.
[192:01.29]Because there's shit in there that I really don't want to lose.
[192:06.93]And there always are those horror stories of, oh, yeah, you shipped out a bunch of stuff and
[192:13.87]It got lost.
[192:16.15]What do you mean it got lost?
[192:17.74]Was it a fucking envelope?
[192:20.28]Was it a water bill?
[192:21.68]Like, how does it get lost?
[192:23.34]It's a gigantic fucking bunch of furniture and a bunch of, like, shit that I own.
[192:27.68]How do you lose it?
[192:31.04]That freaks me out so bad.
[192:32.84]But, like, crossing fingers, I hope that shit doesn't happen to me.
[192:36.84]Although, it probably will now that I'm talking about it out loud.
[192:41.22]But, uh, whatever.
[192:44.31]It's going to be an annoying slow process regardless of even if it goes smoothly.
[192:50.41]It's always like an annoyance, right?
[192:55.38]But we'll see how it goes.
[192:57.24]Thank you, ZeroSue.
[192:58.98]Thank you, CliveRip for the $1.
[193:01.44]Can you please plant bees in the walls before you leave?
[193:06.04]Why would I ever do that to somebody?
[193:09.12]This isn't like a Nickelodeon TV movie.
[193:11.34]I'm not going to do that to somebody.
[193:12.63]What is this like?
[193:14.21]Is this like the camp bully that I'm getting back at?
[193:18.87]No.
[193:21.11]Bake me home.
[193:21.61]Thanks for the $4.
[193:22.59]Hey, Jerma tried to make homemade pizza and it sucked.
[193:25.94]I suspect it's the lack of a drive-thru oven.
[193:28.88]Jokes aside, I need a pick-me-up.
[193:30.50]Thank God for this stream.
[193:31.82]Thank you, dude.
[193:33.32]Thank you, bake me home.
[193:37.37]Sorry about the home-baked pizza, right?
[193:42.45]Take care, dude.
[193:42.97]Thank you so much for the $4.
[193:45.32]Much love to you.
[193:47.90]Aftersmaith, thanks for the $1.
[193:50.57]How can you afford to move when you spent $10,000 of your own money on Jerma Rumble Live?
[194:00.40]Very carefully.
[194:03.48]That was also like two years ago.
[194:06.44]You know what I mean?
[194:07.06]Like, yeah, I spent a shitload of money on that video, but that was also 2016.
[194:17.28]That was a while ago.
[194:21.23]Did you ever make a return on an investment?
[194:22.81]Not at all.
[194:23.19]No, not one dollar.
[194:25.69]How many views does that video have?
[194:28.17]Like a million?
[194:29.19]That video has like just under a million, right?
[194:32.42]No, that was like a 70% loss.
[194:36.20]But I wasn't I wasn't trying to make money on that video.
[194:39.60]I made it because I fucking wanted to.
[194:45.27]Right?
[194:45.51]Like if
[194:46.71]Not looking for a return.
[194:48.55]Just wanted to make it.
[194:56.55]Yeah, that's all the people that have seen it that have now come to the stream.
[195:01.01]Like, that's great.
[195:03.13]I'm glad to know that.
[195:06.49]But there's more where that came from.
[195:11.32]Once I get off that fucking plane in Las Vegas, man.
[195:16.83]I don't even know what the fuck I'm going to be doing.
[195:20.83]This is an Oblivion.
[195:21.75]Ah, fuck, you're right.
[195:24.95]Thank you for catching that.
[195:26.71]Because we're definitely not playing Oblivion anymore.
[195:32.18]Change it.
[195:39.17]Go back to IRL.
[195:40.83]Right there.
[195:41.59]That's good, right?
[195:44.86]I'm going to take the Oblivion part out.
[195:47.56]Alright, there you go.
[195:54.12]The new title is now Hanging.
[195:57.84]Hanging.
[195:58.68]There.
[195:59.10]It is Hanging.
[196:02.60]But thank you to Ancient Sasquatch for the $1.
[196:06.96]Happy 84th birthday, old man.
[196:08.34]Sorry I can only give you $1.
[196:10.35]But hopefully this little bit adds to making sure your move goes smooth as butter.
[196:17.90]Let's hope so.
[196:19.40]We'll find out in about two weeks how the move went.
[196:23.20]Should be interesting nonetheless.
[196:24.64]Thank you DivUSP for the $10.
[196:28.00]No message.
[196:28.94]Thank you, dude.
[196:30.82]It means a lot.
[196:31.36]Thank you for the $10.
[196:33.22]The Annalander, thanks for the $1.
[196:34.82]Germany, if you mark all your VODs as highlights, they stay there forever and never get deleted.
[196:39.47]Along with chat.
[196:43.77]Really?
[196:49.95]I always thought there was a finite amount of time.
[196:53.85]Holy shit, someone just gave $100.
[196:58.30]Let's get to that right now, because that was right now.
[197:02.04]Thank you, Kyra Toby, for the $100.
[197:04.06]$100 from Kyra Toby.
[197:09.78]10,000 bits.
[197:10.70]Happy birthday, Jerma.
[197:11.54]This one's for the retirement fund.
[197:16.61]Thank you so much.
[197:19.92]Thank you for your insanely generous contribution here, man.
[197:27.28]Kyra Toby.
[197:31.43]33 now, man.
[197:31.89]It gets creeping up.
[197:33.27]I'm getting older.
[197:35.71]Feels weird getting to that mid-30 mark.
[197:40.53]Not quite there yet, but I will be next year.
[197:42.31]It's interesting.
[197:46.85]But thank you so much.
[197:50.05]That's a lot of money.
[197:52.15]I'm going to put it all on black.
[197:54.79]And then double it.
[197:55.67]And then put that all on red.
[197:57.39]And then double that.
[197:58.41]And put that on seven.
[198:00.07]And then double quadruped 35 times that.
[198:02.65]And then it's all going on double zero just for you.
[198:11.52]You still look like you're in your 20s.
[198:12.74]You're a vampire.
[198:16.52]Blood's gross.
[198:17.26]I can't eat it.
[198:19.74]Not saying I ever would, but like, how does a vampire eat blood?
[198:23.80]Guys, I can't even eat a rare steak.
[198:25.88]You think a guy could drink blood?
[198:28.84]No way.
[198:33.45]But anyways, thank you to Greasy Streaker for the $1.
[198:41.21]Thank you for streaming.
[198:41.93]I know it's tough streaming while moving.
[198:45.11]You're a good dude.
[198:47.66]Thank you.
[198:50.14]No, I just don't want to disappear.
[198:52.10]Even if these streams are... The word I want to use is shitty.
[198:56.99]Right?
[198:57.21]I mean, just listen to the quality of the microphone.
[199:00.21]Look at where I am.
[199:01.09]I don't have all my stuff.
[199:02.81]I don't have all my usual... I don't have all my fucking usual props and my usual gags.
[199:09.62]But I don't want to just disappear.
[199:11.68]I'd rather just be able to hang out for a few hours every couple of days if I can.
[199:15.99]and then try to plan a couple of big streams before I leave.
[199:20.65]So I don't just want to take off and be like, yeah, see you in like three weeks, everybody.
[199:25.40]I'd much rather be able just to hang out.
[199:28.98]But thank you.
[199:30.72]Thank you also to Tress Nick for the two bucks.
[199:34.54]And he just says, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee.
[199:37.53]I don't know what that means, but thank you for the $2.
[199:41.85]Super Burger Flipper, thanks for the $1.01.
[199:44.38]Happy birthday in a day, Jeremy.
[199:45.48]Hope you have a great 52nd and many more, and that the move goes well.
[199:50.25]Thank you.
[199:51.43]I'm going to try to make it go as smoothly as possible.
[199:55.45]Appreciate it, man.
[199:57.15]Chubby Funster, thanks for the $1.
[199:58.59]Thanks for streaming today, man.
[199:59.63]Been feeling really down today because I lost my job at the keyboard factory.
[200:04.90]They told me I wasn't putting in enough ships.
[200:24.24]Alright, that was alright.
[200:25.10]That was pretty good.
[200:27.87]Thank you, though.
[200:30.17]Thank you to Greasy Streaker again for the $1.
[200:33.17]Cheers to healthy balls.
[200:38.47]I spent enough time waiting.
[200:40.11]There was a pause in between healthy, so it's alright.
[200:42.23]I didn't say anything weird.
[200:44.11]Hey, Dragonflyer, thanks for the $1.
[200:45.85]Jerma, I have four papers due next week, and I just don't have the motivation to start them.
[200:50.43]But as soon as you said I'm full of energy, I started to feel the same way.
[200:54.04]Thanks for that, and I hope you do more stand-up comedy streaming soon.
[201:02.38]I want to go back and just watch, like, the VOD or the clips for that.
[201:05.67]I want to hear the audience.
[201:09.19]I want to hear the audience laughter, you know, even if it's not even real.
[201:12.09]It just makes me, like, feel like it's actually happening, you know what I mean?
[201:15.41]And this is how you swim.
[201:16.71]This is how you reverse swim.
[201:17.59]And it's like if you were trying to get away from a shark, just go like this, and you'll fucking go wicked fast backwards.
[201:26.04]And down.
[201:26.75]You'll go down, too.
[201:27.75]But, like, that gets you deeper.
[201:28.89]So the shark will go, like, right over your fucking head.
[201:37.89]But, thank you.
[201:41.36]Good luck on your papers, Dragonflyer.
[201:44.94]Thank you also to... Who we got here?
[201:53.39]Cephysototus for the $5.
[201:58.57]PAX East was awesome.
[201:59.71]Do you plan on making the trip out for next year?
[202:02.41]I need recommendations for my next Jerma cosplay.
[202:06.92]Next year is a different story.
[202:12.04]I don't know.
[202:12.64]I've got to see where I'm... It's in April, right?
[202:14.48]Like March or April?
[202:16.02]I kind of need to see where I'm at.
[202:18.74]I'm not going to plan on it.
[202:20.04]I've kind of done for... I've done traveling for a little while.
[202:24.35]Pax Vegas, that would be fucking awesome.
[202:27.41]Dude, that would be such... Think of how good of a Pax that would be if it was in Las Vegas.
[202:33.27]Just, like, take out a whole section of, like, the Bellagio or something and just do it there.
[202:40.84]Dengistown just gave $50 and says, Happy birthday.
[202:44.64]Good luck.
[202:45.02]I love you.
[202:45.54]Bye.
[202:47.46]Are you just leaving?
[202:50.00]Thank you for dropping $50 and leaving.
[202:54.18]That's... Thank you.
[202:59.48]Thanks a lot, man.
[203:01.43]Thank you for your incredibly generous $50 donation.
[203:06.83]Thank you.
[203:11.71]A lot of you guys are giving a lot of money tonight.
[203:13.88]Thank you.
[203:14.20]I don't know what else to say.
[203:20.18]Thank you for everything.
[203:23.59]Somebody also mentions that my BIOS settings aren't saving and it's taking more time.
[203:27.17]And it's referring to defaults.
[203:29.49]Get a CMOS battery with these bits.
[203:34.30]That was Canon Inspector.
[203:35.22]Thank you.
[203:37.04]I think this thing's kind of like... This thing's on its last legs anyways.
[203:41.64]I'm not sure I want to repair it.
[203:42.66]I'll probably salvage the parts.
[203:44.08]Take out the 780.
[203:46.14]Take out the RAM.
[203:47.80]The CPU.
[203:49.57]They're all like decent parts, but I don't think I would actually keep this thing going.
[203:54.66]Depends.
[203:56.44]But, thank you for the tip.
[203:59.32]Also, thank you to Last Lamp for the $1.
[204:03.29]The electricity made you so tall now.
[204:07.01]Nice.
[204:08.23]I didn't even notice it.
[204:10.69]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[204:11.55]You already got electrocuted on stream before.
[204:13.67]I did?
[204:26.74]That's the fucking loudest thing I've ever heard.
[204:31.58]Why would you make that your splash screen for your game?
[204:36.10]Why would you do that?
[204:41.53]I really got electrocuted.
[204:43.19]That's the thing.
[204:43.63]I think people think I'm making that up.
[204:46.35]That wasn't bullshit.
[204:48.03]I felt a surge through my pinky and my ring finger through my forearm.
[204:52.50]It was like...
[204:55.12]My hand, like, locked up for a second.
[204:56.64]It was like, ugh!
[204:59.10]That actually happened.
[205:04.59]Quick, see if you have superpowers.
[205:08.75]That's so fucking funny.
[205:12.11]Thank you, Senator Nova.
[205:12.79]Thank you, Captain Morgan, for the $1.
[205:14.05]Do you remember the 21st night of September?
[205:16.56]I do.
[205:17.02]It's right now.
[205:18.56]Thank you, Captain Morgan.
[205:22.08]Thank you also...

[207:03.91]That was fucking hilarious.
[207:05.65]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $1.
[207:07.25]This is my hundredth dollar I've given to you, not counting Jerma expensive.
[207:11.93]You are truly a master of comedy.
[207:15.55]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[207:17.81]I just keep thinking of that.
[207:20.65]Thank you, dude.
[207:22.91]Uh, $100 is a lot of money to give anybody.
[207:25.73]let alone one person like me.
[207:28.96]So thank you.
[207:30.56]I really appreciate it.
[207:33.86]Also, we got here, Jedi Master, thanks for the $1.
[207:43.34]Hey, Jerma, is that the same headset you wore when you worked at Burger Boy's burger joint as a window cashier?
[207:49.32]Also, this audio quality gives me flashbacks to your older videos.
[207:56.64]I mean, I did use like a cheap microphone back in the day, so I can understand how you would see that comparison.
[208:07.52]But thank you, Jedi.
[208:09.78]Thank you, Thoris, for the $1.
[208:11.36]Get some paper cups.
[208:13.80]I will.
[208:14.80]And I will use them.
[208:15.78]I will use the hell out of them.
[208:16.80]Thank you.
[208:18.56]Frility, thank you for the $50 again.
[208:20.51]Thanks for streaming while you're in the middle of moving.
[208:23.11]You're very welcome.
[208:23.77]Is this too loud?
[208:25.05]You're very welcome.
[208:27.60]I should be thanking you for continuing.
[208:35.63]That mic's not on.
[208:36.71]I'm going to turn it on because I keep doing it.
[208:41.77]I keep doing this shit.
[208:43.51]Turn off.
[208:45.25]I'm wiping my nose.
[208:47.11]There we go.
[208:47.67]That's better.
[208:52.07]But thank you for validity.
[208:54.33]For your 50 fucking dollars.
[208:56.23]Also, thank you to Garfield, the Monday killer, for the one dollar.
[208:59.39]And then the Monday tried to get the drop on me, but I slew him with a mighty swing.
[209:03.64]He didn't know what hit him.
[209:04.72]Good gracious, is it Friday already?
[209:06.34]Looking good in the new house, Jerma.
[209:07.74]Vegas suits you well.
[209:08.92]Not the Vegas house.
[209:09.72]We're not there yet.
[209:11.78]Not there yet.
[209:13.95]If you're lucky, you'll turn into a few cartoon characters down at the strip.
[209:17.35]I think Yosemite Sam runs a casino over there.
[209:19.35]I remember seeing SpongeBob set up a ride at one of the local theme parks.
[209:23.15]What nautical nonsense am I?
[209:25.70]Right?
[209:26.06]Peace out.
[209:26.52]Have a garfin weekend.
[209:34.74]Hands free!
[209:36.42]See, I could have done it like this the whole time.
[209:39.13]See?
[209:39.23]See?
[209:43.79]I didn't have to have it on my ears.
[209:45.19]But then how am I going to... I would have to just like smell the sounds.
[209:47.99]You know what I mean?
[209:48.41]I wouldn't be able to even... I should have just kept it like this.
[209:53.97]But thank you, Garfield of Monday Killer, for your $1 and your message.
[209:59.45]Bloop.
[210:00.63]Blue Ape, thanks for the $1.
[210:02.29]Your surrender is denied.
[210:03.77]What?
[210:09.52]Thank you, Blue Ape, though.
[210:10.28]I don't know what that means.
[210:12.70]NodeWire.
[210:13.42]Thanks for the $2, NodeWire.
[210:15.32]Happy early birthday.
[210:16.25]Feels birthday, man.
[210:17.11]Party 100.
[210:20.07]Thank you.
[210:22.55]I'm going to try to make it a relaxing day.
[210:26.09]Because it's been a stressful week.
[210:28.21]That's for sure.

[211:01.09]Thank you.
[211:02.85]Thank you, Egorote Mill.
[211:04.77]Thank you, Johnny Thunder, for the $1.
[211:06.69]Birthday dollar.
[211:07.39]Thank you.
[211:08.91]Corvid Moon, thank you for the... I didn't get this one.
[211:12.11]I missed this one.
[211:13.35]Corvid, are you still here?
[211:15.74]This is $44 from Corvid Moon.
[211:21.66]I'm not sure if you're still here, though.
[211:24.64]Hey, you're good.
[211:25.20]You're still here.
[211:25.74]Okay.
[211:26.18]Well, thank you so much.
[211:27.52]Sorry I missed this 44 fucking dollars from like an hour ago.
[211:32.13]Thank you.
[211:33.69]You just say happy birthday.
[211:34.79]Good luck with the move.
[211:36.79]Thanks a lot, dude.
[211:38.27]Appreciate it.
[211:41.08]Thank you for giving me that large amount of money.
[211:44.68]I will try to put it to good use.
[211:47.68]Thanks, man.
[211:50.19]Thank you also to Jackpot232 for the $9.50.
[211:52.77]Hey, Jerma, just want to wish you a happy birthday.
[211:56.19]And a big thank you for being such an inspiration to me on both my humor and ability to see worth in myself.
[212:02.49]For the past five years, I've been watching your channel.
[212:04.83]You've lightened up my life and inspired me to be comfortable with myself and be able to come out to not only my family, but also myself as trans.
[212:13.51]You're the best YouTuber streamer I've ever watched, and I'm glad you've been making content for so long to make me feel happy.
[212:21.16]Thank you, Jackpot, for the incredibly kind message, first of all.
[212:24.72]And that's really being comfortable in your own skin and being happy with yourself.
[212:32.48]That's one of the most important things in the world, you know.
[212:37.33]And however you can make yourself comfortable, that's what you need to do.
[212:45.70]And you'll watch me.
[212:47.42]I mean, I'm... There are times when I still feel a little, like, awkward, right?
[212:53.91]Or a little weird.
[212:55.19]But 90% of the time, I'm very comfortable.
[212:59.25]And it takes a lot of time to figure that out.
[213:02.59]It takes a lot of self... Sort of self-diagnosis on, like, who you are.
[213:08.62]And how you, you know...
[213:11.12]how you act and who you talk to what things you care about what do you believe in it takes a long fucking time so I'm glad that you are able to um start to feel like you are worth it and you're actually worth of being a person you know what I mean a lot of times it takes it takes
[213:36.16]I mean, it probably took into my... I'd say my, like, late 20s before I really knew who the fuck I even was.
[213:42.30]You know what I mean?
[213:43.72]Takes a while.
[213:50.93]And I've said this many times before.
[213:54.33]However you can feel as comfortable as you can and be the best fucking person you can, do it.
[214:02.13]Nobody knows you but you.
[214:03.23]You're the only person that knows who you are.
[214:04.94]Like, I can know who you are, but... Like, you know you the best.
[214:16.94]Late 20s, aren't you 23?
[214:20.33]Who am I, though?
[214:25.71]You look like a 90s pop singer in the IRL section preview.
[214:29.55]What...
[214:32.02]No, I don't.
[214:46.99]Can I just like have Twitch delete my thumbnails and just put like Guy on camera?
[214:55.07]But regardless.
[214:59.41]I've...
[215:01.31]You guys know how I feel.
[215:06.14]But... I'm glad that... First of all, Jackpot, you've been around for five years.
[215:13.96]That's a long fucking time.
[215:17.24]Just glad you're still watching and you're still enjoying the content.
[215:21.28]The content, right?
[215:22.32]Like... Right, guys?
[215:23.84]That's what we're doing right now.
[215:26.00]I'm in my basement.
[215:27.64]But...
[215:31.30]Shit oh I Thought it was that one still I thought it was this one and I stopped yelling I'll go over here I'll do it over here
[215:55.30]Remember, my brain was backwards when I was doing that, and I was like, oh, can you hear this?
[215:59.10]And then I didn't get a response.
[216:00.78]People said it was the wrong mic, and I didn't.
[216:02.09]I just hear it like, the car.
[216:06.61]That must have been so unbearable.
[216:08.63]I'm so sorry.
[216:10.33]But thank you, jackpot.
[216:12.61]I wish you the best.
[216:14.84]Also, thank you to Chubby Funster for the $1.
[216:17.04]The cat's out of the bag.
[216:17.92]You're one year older.
[216:18.84]I hope your birthday leaves you feline good.
[216:24.63]As long as you don't scream.
[216:25.67]But I can't be fucking trusted.
[216:27.59]Don't you see?
[216:29.53]I can't be trusted with this.
[216:32.35]That's why I need it to stay in the same fucking spot.
[216:35.08]Like, I can't, like, grab it.
[216:36.92]The microphone that I have that's on the stand, I don't touch it.
[216:39.68]I don't fucking grab it.
[216:40.62]I don't move.
[216:41.18]I don't do anything.
[216:42.56]I can hold this.
[216:43.34]It's too much power.
[216:45.19]I can... I want to, like, shove it up my nose and, like, into my brain.
[216:48.57]You know what I mean?
[216:49.09]And just, like, let it sit there and talk through there.
[216:50.85]See if you guys can hear me.
[216:51.91]If I think hard enough, maybe you'll be able to hear me fucking talk in my brain.
[217:00.34]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the dollar here, man.
[217:03.88]Sniff it.
[217:10.20]I told you.
[217:13.78]Now I'm just going to pretend it's not even there.
[217:18.49]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[217:19.79]After staying at my sister's one-room apartment for too long, I was finally able to return back home today.
[217:25.33]As I mentioned the other night, the damage to the house was minimal, but the damage to my college is pretty serious.
[217:30.29]They gave a tentative timeline today that says the earliest classes can resume October 1st.
[217:35.61]Well, at least this evacuation has given me the chance to watch a lot of Star Trek The Next Generation.
[217:43.62]Well, thankfully, that's a fairly quick turnaround for to be able to go back on October 1st.
[217:52.58]So that's at least good that you'll be able to get back there.
[217:56.22]But again, glad that you're safe.
[218:00.28]Hopefully that wasn't too much damage, just too much trouble that your friends and family obviously had to go through because that sucks.
[218:10.19]I wish you the best, man.
[218:11.85]Hopefully when you go back... School is in session, right?
[218:17.89]And it's not like... Sometimes they'll do... They'll trickle it in or something.
[218:22.50]Or you might get half classes or something like that.
[218:24.86]Hopefully you... Hopefully it's all good.
[218:28.66]But thank you.
[218:30.18]Glad to hear that you're alright.
[218:32.85]Also, AfterSmath.
[218:34.25]Thanks for the $1.
[218:35.91]TuneAgeMutantNinjaTeedles.
[218:39.88]That's correct.
[218:40.48]That's a good four-player cartoon video game.
[218:45.74]Thank you, Poiple, for the $4.
[218:48.46]Feels birthday, man.
[218:49.34]Thank you, 402.
[218:50.45]Appreciate that.
[218:52.01]Free iPod.
[218:52.75]Thanks for the $1.
[218:53.53]Happy birthday.
[218:54.09]Love you, dude.
[218:54.57]Thanks a lot, free iPod.
[218:57.19]Hopefully I get one.
[219:00.37]It is my birthday.
[219:02.85]And your title, your name says it all.
[219:05.64]Could use a new one.
[219:08.18]No, I couldn't.
[219:10.46]Oh, by the way, what the fuck is up with you, Apple?
[219:14.50]What the fuck are you doing?
[219:16.35]I was gonna buy one of those little Apple iPhone SE phones, and you discontinued them for your gigantic fucking iPad VR screens.
[219:27.88]Why?
[219:28.92]Why would you get rid of it?
[219:29.74]Why would you get rid of the fucking SE?
[219:34.20]I wanted that, like, two days before I was gonna buy it.
[219:38.10]These fucking...
[219:40.43]These idiots decide that they're going to remove them.
[219:45.98]I don't want a screen.
[219:47.40]I don't want a phone that's this big.
[219:49.52]I don't want to hold a brick to my ear.
[219:51.98]How are you going to put half these phones in your pocket?
[219:54.68]How the fuck are you going to put the phones in your pocket?
[219:56.92]Are we going to have to start, like, taping them to our chests?
[220:00.62]Like, I don't understand.
[220:03.83]I want that fucking SE.
[220:07.50]Oh, by the way, here's another fucking funny thing about Apple.
[220:10.81]Two different stores, two different Apple stores, I tried to call them.
[220:14.43]I called one, I called another one.
[220:16.95]Both of them had the same experience.
[220:19.62]Oh, please hold while we get a fucking super genius to get on the phone and you can ask any question you want.
[220:26.24]You want to buy?
[220:27.01]Sure.
[220:27.35]Okay.
[220:29.32]The first time I was on hold for 10 straight minutes without anybody answering the phone.
[220:33.35]So I hung the fuck up.
[220:35.15]Called a different store a day later.
[220:37.63]Same exact thing happened, like 12 minutes on hold and nobody picked up the fucking phone.
[220:42.67]I just wanted to know if they had any in inventory in the back that I could just buy.
[220:47.47]Because obviously they had at least a handful of them still out on display when whatever the guy, I don't even know who the CEO is anymore.
[220:58.18]The guy walks on stage and he goes like this and he walks around and he's like, okay, here's what happens next.
[221:02.89]I don't know why they all do that.
[221:03.83]Why do they all like, what's this?
[221:05.37]Like this.
[221:09.44]Yeah, they announced the new iPhones, and what, all of a sudden, all of your SEs all fucking disintegrated?
[221:16.03]No, they're in the back.
[221:17.25]I know they're in the back.
[221:18.73]Because Tom Cook got out there.
[221:22.55]Yeah, good old Tom Nook was out there talking about collecting shells from people.
[221:28.07]And I know that you just took them out of the, you took the cases, you brought them into the fucking back room.
[221:35.02]And a bus is going to come and pick those up in like three weeks.
[221:38.77]I want one.
[221:40.27]And I want a new one that's out of the box.
[221:41.77]I don't want to get one of those fucked up weird ones from Amazon or eBay that somebody could like, like, oh, let me get in there, like crack it open and like put a fake fucking like bug in there and like listen to him like scream swears at people and representatives on fucking tech support.
[221:54.20]I don't want that.
[221:55.44]No, I want a regular new one that came out of the box.
[222:06.77]Is it my birthday yet?
[222:13.27]I'm gonna be late to my 1 a.m.
[222:14.81]dinner.
[222:15.13]No, I won't.
[222:15.59]We got time.
[222:17.17]We're good.
[222:18.31]We're almost done anyways.
[222:21.03]Where were we?
[222:21.47]Oh, free iPod.
[222:23.19]Yeah, that's what that was.
[222:24.16]Thanks.
[222:25.32]Don't you need to get dressed?
[222:26.14]I don't have any clothes.
[222:27.60]I'm gonna go to like a nice restaurant and I'm gonna be like, Oh, hey, man.
[222:31.76]You guys have root beer here?
[222:36.30]Hey, man.
[222:37.56]Oh, this table looks good.
[222:38.48]Yeah.
[222:40.93]Do you guys do, uh... Do you guys do, uh, what, the Shirley Temples, man?
[222:47.48]I could really go for a Shirley Temple.
[222:48.74]I'd love those.
[222:50.92]Here comes the improv.
[222:56.12]Hey, Kermit.
[222:57.34]Uh, also, I know you guys have, like, a really nice restaurant, but, man, do you guys have, like, kids' menus?
[223:04.76]Do you guys have a kids' menu?
[223:05.62]Do you have macaroni and cheese and chicken tenders?
[223:08.24]Yeah, that's what I'm kind of looking for right now.
[223:19.64]Imagine going... That would be so embarrassing.
[223:22.96]I'll do it.
[223:23.72]I mean, I'm... I'll do it.
[223:25.74]I'm going to do that because that's what's going to happen.
[223:29.02]I'm not going to do like the hunched over like... I'm dressed like this and we're going to... Look, I'm just going to tell him I'm moving.
[223:40.16]Can you please turn on the light in the hallway?
[223:41.64]There's no light back there.
[223:43.40]Look, I'll get... Whatever it is that you think is back there, I'll get rid of it.
[223:46.10]Ready?
[223:58.40]I got it.
[224:01.12]See?
[224:01.22]I just had to do, like, a little bit of, like, uh, kimchi over here.
[224:05.76]Not Kim, uh, reiki.
[224:07.58]Reiki?
[224:08.16]I had to give some reiki over this way.
[224:12.98]Whatever the fuck the thing is called.
[224:20.62]Thank you.
[224:22.86]Thank you, free iPod, for the one dollar.
[224:25.22]Thank you, Darkstar, for the one dollar.

[224:59.61]Love you, Jeremy.
[225:00.15]Happy birthday.
[225:01.61]I actually installed Fortnite on mobile, and it was like 20 frames a second, and I got irritated, and I uninstalled it.
[225:07.35]I'm like a fucking in-bed.
[225:08.56]I don't even like that game, but I just did it.
[225:10.38]But anyways, that's the whole story.

[225:39.54]I wanted to like just hold it like this.
[225:41.61]I'm out of things to do.
[225:43.11]Now, do you understand?
[225:44.29]I have nothing to do.
[225:46.37]But besides like packing and shipping and labeling, I have my iPad.
[225:52.85]So like I caved and I downloaded Fortnite on my fucking iPad because I'm sitting there going like, what the fuck am I going to do with my life?
[226:01.33]I couldn't stream or anything.
[226:02.65]So I just barely was able to do this today.
[226:08.53]And this was at like 3 o'clock in the morning last night.
[226:10.79]I'm not going to turn the stream on.
[226:13.25]But thank you, nonetheless.
[226:15.23]Mr. Sneakman, thanks for the $2.65.
[226:16.53]Hey, it's me, Mr. Sneakman.
[226:19.05]Happy 50th birthday, Jerma.
[226:20.59]Thanks for being a great streamer.
[226:21.69]Have a great weekend and good luck in Vegas.
[226:24.24]And then he gets run over by incoming traffic.
[226:28.78]Poor Mr. Sneakman.
[226:30.64]Thank you, Mr. Sneakman, for the almost $3 here.
[226:32.78]Thank you, Lizzy Crazy, for the $1.
[226:35.36]Happy birthday, Jeremy.
[226:36.16]I celebrate my 25th birthday next week.

[226:41.28]M-I-U.
[226:43.38]Anyways, love you.
[226:44.18]Well, I mean, we are both turning 25.
[226:50.36]So, I mean, that's kind of, yeah, I mean, it's cool.
[226:52.82]That's pretty cool.
[226:53.46]We're both young and still with it.
[226:56.18]You know what I mean?
[226:57.46]I still go into restaurants and I got hunched around.
[226:59.40]I, like, ask if they have fucking mac and cheese on the kid's menu, you know.
[227:06.79]Jerma, your hair looks like a chocolate-glazed muffin.
[227:18.64]I can't laugh at that.
[227:20.16]I have to suppress that because everybody's gonna fucking... I can't think that's funny.
[227:40.34]I swallowed it.
[227:41.36]Because if I laugh at that, then that's going to be, people are going to say it, and that's all I'm going to hear.
[227:47.49]I'm going to hear it in my sleep.
[227:55.38]It's just a haircut.
[227:56.32]If it was like this, that shows my bad hairline.
[227:58.42]No.
[228:00.66]But thank you.
[228:02.46]Thank you, Dr. Frohman, for the $1 on top of Old Smokey, all covered with hair.
[228:06.79]Of course, I'm referring to... Wait, what's going on here?
[228:12.19]I'm referring to Smokey the Bear.
[228:15.52]I don't get it.
[228:16.48]Thank you, though.
[228:17.38]Thank you, HoleofOneZombie, for the $1.
[228:18.58]Here's another dollar so you can splash out on that birthday meal and buy an extra pickled egg.
[228:23.49]Yuck.
[228:24.37]I'll try it.
[228:25.26]I'm not going to like it, but I'll try it.
[228:26.44]Thank you, Moby.
[228:27.70]MobyUse1 for the $1.
[228:30.74]Happy birthday.
[228:31.38]Hope you have an amazing day.
[228:32.36]Thank you for all the years of solid entertainment.
[228:34.77]I mean it to my heart when I say you're the guy who's made me laugh the most in my life.
[228:40.33]Always giving me a smile.
[228:42.02]By the way, I'm turning 20 in a week as well and thinking of getting my first scotch legally.
[228:47.88]Any recommendations?
[228:48.66]Well, my favorite whiskey is Johnny Walker.
[228:51.22]I almost just said it wrong.
[228:53.51]Johnny Walker is my favorite whiskey.
[228:56.43]There's all kinds of different qualities and tiers.
[228:59.37]Johnny Walker Blue is my favorite alcohol I've ever had.
[229:02.07]I like it.
[229:04.27]I like Johnny Walker Blue.
[229:05.65]It's expensive, but there's Johnny Walker Red, Johnny Walker Black.
[229:10.12]There's Johnny Walker Gold label, I think, now.
[229:13.20]Johnny Walker Black is like...
[229:15.61]It's like $30.
[229:15.99]It's like $30 or $40 for a small bottle.
[229:18.51]So it's not that bad.
[229:22.59]But I like Johnny Walker.
[229:24.05]That's pretty much the only recommendation I would be able to give you.
[229:28.17]But... Happy 21st.
[229:31.45]Coming soon here.
[229:33.64]Thank you so much, Moby.
[229:36.22]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[229:37.30]You better believe I'm going to take that clip of you dancing to September and do some wacky shit with it.
[229:41.16]I didn't dance.
[229:43.89]I've moved my head like this.
[229:45.18]That's not dancing.
[229:46.04]That's called nodding to the beat.
[229:48.70]But do what you must.
[229:50.68]Feitoru, thanks for the $1.
[229:51.90]Have a cool birthday, Dollar.

[230:06.50]Happy birthday, dude.
[230:07.98]Keep on keeping on, jermaHeart.
[230:11.65]I'm going to try.
[230:13.65]I think the brunt of it is done.
[230:19.12]It's just kind of coasting along and throwing away a bunch of trash and then getting the place ready and then leaving and just being out and having this place get off my hands forever, right?
[230:32.41]So it's a slow process, but from now on I think I can relax a little bit now because at least I know that all my stuff is on the way.
[230:40.91]But thank you.
[230:41.39]Appreciate it, man.

[238:57.88]I'm not stressed.
[238:58.48]I'm good.

[240:04.81]We talked a couple weeks ago.
[240:07.45]I think he was moving at that point, and now I'm moving, so we both kind of caught each other at times where we both really couldn't do anything.
[240:16.25]So we'll do something together again, for sure.
[240:19.90]It was the aliens.
[240:20.69]Thanks for the $2.45.

[240:36.98]Don't worry about that.
[240:38.80]That's not a don't.
[240:40.84]That you giving me more than a dollar is not a priority.
[240:44.65]Don't worry about that.
[240:47.19]Trust me, don't sweat over not giving me money.
[240:52.47]Thank you for even considering it.
[240:56.57]I want to wish you a fucking awesome birthday, and I think I speak for all of us when I say that we appreciate and love you.
[241:01.97]Thanks for being a genuine and lovely person.

[241:48.17]What is that?
[241:56.34]Don't be a fink.
[241:58.02]It's a New Vegas joke?
[241:59.36]Okay.
[242:01.66]Okay, I see.
[242:03.16]No, I'm not a degenerate.
[242:04.39]I'm not going to turn into a degenerate.

[242:25.33]Always just missed it.
[242:29.87]Yeah, but I'll be around, right?
[242:32.45]Like just because I'm not going to any conventions over the next like 6 to 12 months doesn't mean I'm never going to go ever again.
[242:37.37]You know what I mean?
[242:40.65]You'll see me at the PAX.
[242:42.69]I'll do the PAX round probably at some point midway through or at the end of 2019 into 2020.

[251:47.19]You're a huge inspiration to me.
[251:48.49]I've just started streaming and it's hard, man.
[251:50.48]But every time I want to give up, I just remember how long you've been doing it.
[251:53.94]And it gives me hope.
[251:57.08]I wish you the best of luck in streaming.
[252:00.21]It's a... It's a rabid kind of tough world out here.
[252:06.63]Especially nowadays.
[252:08.99]So it can be difficult.
[252:12.05]I wish you the best.
[252:13.29]I hope you find something that you like to do.
[252:16.26]Something you're good at.
[252:16.86]Something that you think is fun to stream.
[252:24.44]And... Do you stream Smite?
[252:28.18]That would make maybe...
[252:30.87]You probably don't, but if you do, it's a game of the good.

[255:34.10]And one of my brother's friends, we were doing like rocket bounces to each other from the trampoline over the roof of the bouncy house into the bouncy house.
[255:42.05]And one of my brother's friends shattered his leg in half and like literally broke his leg in half and like had to be like rushed to the hospital.
[255:48.17]It was a terrible birthday.
[255:49.45]That was the worst birthday I've ever had.
