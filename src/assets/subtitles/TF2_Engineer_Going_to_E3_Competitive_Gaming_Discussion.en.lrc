[00:08.87]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.81]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.65]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer, Aggressive Defense Engineer.
[00:22.02]Playing on the big coil on Thunder Mountain, or the big snake, whatever you want to call it.
[00:26.86]It's I think the last part of Thunder Mountain.
[00:29.32]But anyways, this video is not going to really cover any of the gameplay on the screen, but it is going to cover a gaming topic.
[00:36.52]And that is competitive.
[00:38.59]And what it now means to me, and how I feel about the competitive communities across the globe, doesn't matter what game you're playing.
[00:46.36]Because, as you know, some of you, most of you, a lot of you know by now, we are going to E3.
[00:52.51]Now, if you haven't been on the channel for a few days or you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll try and break it down a little bit here.
[00:57.65]So a few days ago, me, Star, and MLC_St3alth, we joined into this Shoot Mania Storm tournament on twitch.tv.
[01:04.43]And the two people that were the top two in that tournament move on to E3 to play in the Grand Finals.
[01:10.99]And we're one of those teams.
[01:13.14]I don't know how we did it.
[01:14.46]I don't know.
[01:15.30]It really, it still hasn't hit me yet.
[01:16.80]I'm still kind of sitting in this chair going, am I really about to get on a plane in like less than 24 hours to go to E3?
[01:23.26]Is this really happening?
[01:24.10]My mind has not settled around that fact yet.
[01:27.02]And I know it will.
[01:27.64]When I get on that plane, I'm going to be sitting there.
[01:29.74]The captain's going to go, this is your captain speaking.
[01:32.14]We are now taking off to Los Angeles International Airport.
[01:34.62]And I'm just going to be like, do it!
[01:35.92]God, I'm going to E3!
[01:37.66]And I'm going to scare the ever-living crap out of everybody on the plane.
[01:40.81]And that's not my intention, I apologize if you're on that plane that I'm on, but I am getting off track.
[01:46.39]The point is, we are going there to E3, we're all going to be there, we're all going to hang out, Shibby's going to be there, or we're all going to just, it's going to be ridiculous.
[01:55.12]And I'm bringing my camera, don't worry, I am going to get random footage of us being crazy in those hotel rooms.
[02:01.60]But I do have to say this, though.
[02:03.08]This is a massive thank you, massive shout out to anybody that came to that stream that was supporting our team.
[02:09.61]Because we would look at that chat and we would see people going, Yeah, YouTube money!
[02:13.21]Crush them!
[02:13.71]Let's go!
[02:14.65]And there were so many of them.
[02:16.15]It was just so motivating.
[02:17.55]Whether you came from Shibby, Star, MLC_St3alth, my channel, wherever you came from.
[02:22.18]Thank you so much for doing that.
[02:23.86]You guys rock.
[02:25.04]Hell freaking yeah.
[02:27.79]So now I want to transition from that to talk about competitive gaming and sort of what I think about it and how I feel now, especially now, after winning, or not winning, but coming in the top two of this tournament to go to E3.
[02:39.68]So competitive gaming, the only thing, the only experience I've ever had with comp gaming is when I was 11.
[02:44.16]When I was 11 years old, I won a gaming competition at my local blockbuster.
[02:51.39]Now that might not sound like competitive gaming, but it was for me.
[02:55.23]When I was 11, I was like, oh my god, I'm playing, I'm gonna be in a tournament.
[02:58.95]And it was exciting.
[03:00.28]But so the winner of that tournament got to get free rentals from Blockbuster.
[03:03.82]I think for a couple months or something like that, you get free video game rentals.
[03:07.80]That's back when video game rentals were the big thing.
[03:11.44]And that's also back when Super Nintendo and SEGA Genesis were the big guys on the block.
[03:16.45]And now I feel old.
[03:19.55]Talking about Super Nintendo, I owned a regular Nintendo and an Atari.
[03:23.64]That's how old I am.
[03:24.92]I'm pretty much as old as a dinosaur egg.
[03:27.12]Well, not really.
[03:28.36]But that is the only time, up until this past weekend, where I've ever competed in a game situation for real prizes or real notoriety.
[03:39.07]And I think I want to keep doing it.
[03:41.25]because it was so much fun guys this last weekend it was really tough it was really competitive it was really adrenaline rushing and we spent a lot of time practicing we were prepared for this tournament and even still there were a lot of good teams and when you go up against the team that's evenly matched with you
[03:58.86]calling out strategies and trying to get in position, trying to really land down those shots, my mind was in a tornado.
[04:06.13]And it wasn't a bad thing, it was a good thing, and it really got me into the game, and I want to keep doing it.
[04:11.34]It was a rush I can't explain, that a lot of you guys that play competitive probably already know what I'm talking about.
[04:16.98]We were going up against some Quake pros, we were going up against Counter-Strike 1.6 pros, a couple other guys that had a lot of competitive experience, and it was just so exciting.
[04:26.64]And my question for the video, I guess, is competitive-wise, how many of you guys have done some tournaments, or maybe won a couple things?
[04:34.77]And that doesn't mean Team Fortress, I'm talking anything.
[04:37.39]I'm talking Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Quake, Unreal.
[04:41.05]A lot of you guys are older, too, so you might have some of that experience under your belt as well.
[04:45.56]And I guess a follow-up question is, getting into competitive, how do you get prepared?
[04:51.70]Because how I got prepared is I drank like four coffees and listened to a bunch of music in my headphones as loud as it can go to try and get me squared away, and then we just started playing.
[05:01.58]So I want to know what your guys' process is, because this is really interesting stuff.
[05:05.48]And it's stuff I like to know.
[05:07.78]So before this video is over, I want to bring this up again.
[05:11.20]Thank you so much to everybody that came and supported that stream and came and supported us playing in that tournament.
[05:18.65]And also a lot of stuff went in behind the scenes with Shibby2142 kind of being our PR guy to get our team straightened away.
[05:26.43]And IncredibleOrb.
[05:28.06]Without IncredibleOrb, I would not have been in this tournament.
[05:30.96]Neither would anybody.
[05:32.12]So big, huge shout-out to Orb.
[05:34.58]You the man, dude.
[05:35.68]And I hope to see you at E3.
[05:36.78]I'm going to give you a big hug.
[05:39.18]So thank you guys so much for watching video-wise for this channel in the next four or five days.
[05:44.36]I'm going to have stuff scheduled uploaded, so don't worry.
[05:46.58]There's going to be content here, regardless of me being at E3.
[05:50.14]And if any of you guys are in the Los Angeles area at the E3 Expo, I will salute you and hopefully I see you there.
[05:56.11]So I'll see you guys all soon and take care, everybody.
