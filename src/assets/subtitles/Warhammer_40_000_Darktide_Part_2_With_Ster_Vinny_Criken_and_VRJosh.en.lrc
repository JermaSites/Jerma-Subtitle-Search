[00:06.23]Hey, sorry, I forgot to unmute.
[00:08.31]I've been talking.
[00:14.25]I was talking for about five minutes.
[00:16.15]Just typing, hold on.
[00:23.08]Just doing a little bit of typing.
[00:37.05]Alright, so hello.
[00:37.67]How are you?
[00:42.03]Hope everybody's doing good.
[00:43.19]Welcome to another stream.
[00:44.13]I saw you yesterday, but you know.
[00:47.34]Today, Darktide is launched.
[00:49.60]It's on Steam right now.
[00:53.90]Sponsored to play it.
[00:57.65]I will be sponsored for the stream today.
[01:01.78]Game's really fun.
[01:02.38]I'm looking forward to playing again with another group.
[01:05.66]We got... Who we got in the spread?
[01:07.16]There's a lot of people that wanted to play today.
[01:08.72]We might be jumping around.
[01:10.86]We've got... Ster.
[01:14.70]We've got Vinny.
[01:17.90]We've got... I'm being told right now we might have another one.
[01:21.94]Hold on.
[01:27.01]Yeah, drops are enabled too.
[01:28.35]Drops are enabled.
[01:32.42]We need one more, apparently.
[01:34.06]Okay.
[01:34.18]That's gonna be easy enough.
[01:39.78]Let's see.
[01:49.56]Yeah, it should be fun.
[01:50.87]I'm playing as an Ogryn.
[01:52.27]If you don't know, Ogryn's the big guy.
[01:57.89]The great reveal of who the fourth player is gonna be is coming up here very shortly.
[02:05.74]Yeah, there was like a pool of people that were potentially available today, and there's just whoever's around.
[02:14.95]Did you say what?
[02:18.35]I'm no, I'm not.
[02:19.79]This is sponsored stream.
[02:21.09]I'm not going to read that.
[02:22.31]How does it feel to be the resident Twitch theater kid?
[02:28.03]Well, it's resident a Twitch theater adult.
[02:31.49]Um.
[02:33.43]I, I'm not, I'm an older, I'm older.
[02:42.74]I'm older.
[02:45.84]That's such a little kid thing to say.
[02:49.08]No, I'm, I'm older.
[02:51.40]Oh, okay.
[02:53.00]I'm not kid.
[02:56.98]Okay.
[02:59.32]Alright, let's get a call, uh, with the three we know are going to be around.
[03:05.32]I got my tweet out.
[03:06.86]Thank you again to Warhammer for sponsoring this stream and the last one that I did.
[03:11.11]Launch day.
[03:11.65]Games out.
[03:12.51]Four-player co-op.
[03:13.29]It's on Steam right now.
[03:19.33]I will make a phone call.
[03:20.49]We need to make a new group then.
[03:22.71]Actually, do we?
[03:27.13]Oh.
[03:27.44]Alright.
[03:28.94]We got people coming.
[03:29.82]We got people coming from all over the place here.
[03:32.00]Hold on.
[03:33.46]Hold on.
[03:33.88]The final... Hold on.
[03:41.12]It's down to... And we can, look, we can jump around.
[03:43.90]Four players, if there's like six or seven people that are around, we can just, we can smush up the lobbies.
[03:48.13]It's fine.
[03:51.55]Okay.
[03:53.77]Let me see it, because we're seeing if Criken was around.
[03:58.30]I think Criken was around.
[04:02.11]But if Criken is not around immediately, then we will go with another person that has just DM'd me.
[04:09.31]And they will not be revealed until it is time.
[04:16.76]Let's see how this plays out in the next 60 seconds.
[04:26.34]Connor, do I have you on Steam?
[04:30.26]Well, I just ruined it.
[04:33.70]Why am I assuming that Connor is watching the stream right now?
[04:39.98]He's not.
[04:40.40]Is he watching?
[04:43.87]Oh, why am I just like, oh, hey, yeah, man.
[04:45.31]Are you watching?
[04:46.65]He's probably not even here.
[04:48.59]He probably DM'd me from the bathroom or something, right?
[04:52.47]He probably DM'd me from his kitchen.
[04:55.15]Why am I assuming he's just here?
[05:00.36]Alright, well, let's get in a call, first and foremost, because, you know, let's see how this plays out.
[05:07.10]I'm just going to, we're just going to call Criken.
[05:08.98]But he's going to call everybody.
[05:10.48]I'm calling literally this whole group.
[05:12.21]So whoever, honestly, I'm calling this whole group, whoever answers, answers.
[05:15.37]Let me add the people here.
[05:25.37]But yeah, should be fun.
[05:26.09]What are you adding here?
[05:37.40]Okay, and... Is he playing a game right now?
[05:46.89]I'm just calling.
[05:47.65]Whoever answers, answers.
[05:48.39]Let's see what happens.
[06:01.94]Oh.
[06:02.58]Alright, Ster has answered.
[06:03.54]I have answered the call.
[06:06.06]You are in.
[06:06.90]You are the first contestant.
[06:08.85]I apologize.
[06:10.03]Strippen said he was gonna play with you, but after yesterday, and he figured out you can only do like two voices, he really wasn't interested anymore.
[06:18.71]Oh.
[06:19.49]Well, that's okay.
[06:21.97]Alright.

[07:02.98]Connor answered.

[07:29.85]Alright, well, let's just tell Craig.
[07:34.03]I'm just going to be like, this guy Connor got in our DM group.
[07:37.65]I don't know what happened.
[07:39.40]This guy.
[07:39.88]Alright, so Connor, do I have you on Steam?
[07:45.40]I think so for what's it called?
[07:48.20]The battleship.
[07:49.28]Oh, that's right.
[07:49.60]That's right.
[07:49.92]Okay.
[07:50.50]No, we did a war or risk.
[07:52.82]That's what it's called.
[07:53.91]So I should have you.
[07:56.20]Also, Connor, I think we're following each other, but do we know each other?
[08:00.64]You know what?
[08:02.04]Vinny, I messaged you one time asking about your microphone.
[08:05.16]Dude, somebody just said nightmare blunt rotation.
[08:07.74]I was like, what microphone do you use?
[08:09.42]And you couldn't find, like, the cable.
[08:10.75]I couldn't find the cable that connects to your microphone.
[08:13.87]Oh, my God.
[08:14.37]How long ago was this, Connor?
[08:15.41]It was, like, over a year ago.
[08:17.37]Oh.
[08:18.25]And I ordered a cable, and it took two months to get here, and it was the wrong cable.
[08:21.19]Oh, God.
[08:26.44]yeah yeah I I understand this pain I still have it to this day yep I'll hopefully I get the cable eventually alright so yeah we'll cycle people in and out uh okay just to get the to get the ball rolling here let's um so let me I think should I make the lobby or do you know how do you do it is there is there a quick way
[08:49.41]Oh, my character is sick.
[08:50.87]Alright, hold on.
[08:52.41]I don't know.
[08:52.75]Let me see.
[08:54.13]I think I remember, but let me get in the game.
[08:56.34]I'll let you know.
[08:56.80]I'm going to be just recording this.
[08:58.52]I streamed earlier, but Jerma, thank you for the invite again, buddy.
[09:01.38]I appreciate it.
[09:02.04]Yeah.
[09:03.26]Alright.
[09:04.08]So, Ster, I have you.
[09:06.20]So if I invite you to my strike team, should get that.
[09:11.55]I have accepted your strike team.
[09:12.83]I'm ready to strike.
[09:14.17]Okay.
[09:14.75]Now, the other of you, Connor and Vinny, if you could appear online on Steam so I could, you know what I mean?
[09:22.56]Yeah, I would love to, but my Darktide, for some reason, isn't the most bizarre resolution I've ever seen.
[09:29.58]It's like one and a half times my monitor.
[09:31.50]It doesn't make any sense, so I'll be in in a minute.
[09:33.64]Okay.
[09:34.44]Yeah, I'm currently trying to get troubleshooting.
[09:37.77]Okay.
[09:38.37]Stero, you want to just do one?
[09:39.63]You knew it was random?
[09:41.72]They take a while.
[09:42.96]Do they?
[09:43.20]They take like 15 minutes, don't they?
[09:45.68]By the way, if you guys know, this is a sponsored stream.
[09:47.80]I'm supposed to play.
[09:48.64]Wouldn't that be kind of messed up if we did it without them while Criken sat there?
[09:54.93]That's true.
[09:56.05]That would be kind of crazy.
[09:58.33]Criken's probably sitting there watching going like, are you?
[10:00.75]You're going to do one just you and Ster, huh?
[10:03.24]What the fuck is going on over there?
[10:07.00]I'll be like 60 seconds and then I'll be ready to jump in.
[10:10.76]Yeah, let's start one then.
[10:12.30]Alright.
[10:12.92]Wait, no.
[10:14.00]Wait, what?
[10:16.32]Don't swear.
[10:17.02]I'll be right there.
[10:19.54]It's okay.
[10:19.96]Look, does it take 10 minutes to get ready?
[10:21.90]Look, let's put it up on the screen so people can see.
[10:24.45]Here we are.
[10:24.93]Hi.
[10:26.25]Well, let's go over the characters.
[10:27.81]The character creator.
[10:28.99]Let's go over the characters.
[10:30.27]All the lore.
[10:31.91]Oh, we're not doing that again.
[10:32.93]Top to bottom.
[10:34.19]And then we can start.
[10:34.87]Actually, you know what?
[10:36.27]How much do you know about 40k?
[10:38.64]um well like uh like every literally everything do you are you actually a fan of 40k no I was gonna start making up and people would just believe it if they didn't no well no you shouldn't do that because I'm sponsored to play this yeah you can't do that for Jerma right I did that last time and and I yeah okay I was being a jerk what level uh you're 17. so you've been playing a lot you must like it then
[11:03.11]Uh, yeah.
[11:03.73]Been getting into it.
[11:04.63]It took me a bit.
[11:05.65]It grew on me.
[11:06.99]Jerma, you should let, uh, Criken in for now because I still got to figure out my stuff.
[11:10.61]Okay.
[11:11.03]No, we'll cycle people in.
[11:12.41]So, we'll get you in, Connor.
[11:13.57]I'll let you know when I'm ready if I get it figured out.
[11:15.38]Thanks for being available right here.
[11:17.40]No problem.
[11:17.70]You guys have fun.
[11:18.46]Yeah, we'll see you in, like, maybe, like, an hour or so.
[11:20.14]We'll grab you in.
[11:21.30]Sounds good.
[11:22.46]Good guy, Connor.
[11:23.66]Good guy, Connor.
[11:24.46]You know what I mean?
[11:25.60]Yeah, good guy, Connor.
[11:26.62]Alright, hey, now somebody tell Criken to join.
[11:30.06]Why can't I do it?
[11:32.17]He made other plans, probably.
[11:33.97]Yeah, what if he just jumped in the game?
[11:37.94]Please, we're sorry.
[11:43.90]Yeah, with the release, all my video settings got changed, so I just had to go in and mess with some options, but they're good now.
[11:51.68]Can somebody read what Criken just wrote in the DM group?
[11:55.72]He said, what is going on?
[11:57.34]And I said, we need you.
[12:05.76]just look can we just pretend this is like an elaborate joke yeah I'm on the toilet stall oh my god alright okay I could start on the toilet stall for time here is oh he's not standing on the toilet right you need commas that I do know is my character is prisoner um my family lineage we've all been prisoners it's a last name
[12:33.33]Ladies and gentlemen!
[12:33.93]Three generations back, my great-grandfather said the emperor doesn't wipe.
[12:38.78]And our family line's been in prison ever since.
[12:40.98]For that many generations?
[12:43.06]Goddamn.
[12:43.52]Yeah.
[12:43.80]Actually, I wanna look at my weapons.
[12:45.56]So, for those that don't know, Darktide is a four-player co-op survival game where you have to fight waves and waves of incredibly dangerous enemies.
[12:54.06]Those enemies can range from machine gunners to zombie-type enemies to monsters.
[12:59.47]uh to other big big big things right and it's all about working together and trying to stop if you ever played vermintide obviously same company same group uh and it's very fun and I think that we should take a look at the items well done I only have two Ster do you have a purple like do you have any purples I'll be right back once I I I guess I yeah
[13:27.83]What's your weapon loadout look like?
[13:31.21]I'm not using it.
[13:32.21]I've got this charge gun that blows people up.
[13:35.39]I'm trying.
[13:37.39]And an axe.
[13:39.81]Ooh, that sounds pretty good.
[13:41.87]You know you can upgrade your anything to purple if you want it.
[13:45.99]And I do apologize to everybody watching that the only content in the last 12 minutes of the stream so far has been me walking back and forth down this hallway while I talk filler words.
[13:55.24]I think it's been great content to tell Kryken to go away and then ask him to come back.
[14:01.83]Then need him, yeah.
[14:07.55]I mean, I've been doing laps around the hub, bro.
[14:10.20]Have you been?
[14:10.76]It feels like 20 minutes now.
[14:13.50]So... I'm ready.
[14:16.86]We'll be good.
[14:17.22]Yeah.
[14:17.98]How long has he been on the toilet?
[14:20.29]So wait, was he truly ready at all then?
[14:25.29]What if he was on the toilet just typing, like, oh, what the fuck, guys?
[14:29.13]I'm ready.
[14:30.23]I'm here.
[14:30.65]And he's just like leaning down like this, like on the toilet.
[14:32.72]He just doesn't want us to know.
[14:37.47]But on the... Oh, wait, they did come out with a beta headgear, right?
[14:43.21]Yeah.
[14:43.43]Yeah, it's a helmet that has a beta logo on it, so you can prove to everyone that you're a beta.
[14:49.07]Do I have a... Is this it?
[14:50.43]That's why I'm wearing it.
[14:51.05]I don't... Yeah, I don't even know where it is.
[14:55.51]I don't know how to access it.
[14:57.31]Is this... Do I get it?
[14:58.23]You should have it.
[15:00.27]You press I and go to cosmetics.
[15:02.37]What?
[15:02.57]I don't have it.
[15:06.17]Is it an accessory?
[15:09.91]It's a head.
[15:11.55]Yeah, I don't have it either.
[15:12.49]That's weird.
[15:14.19]I think this is the Orgrans.
[15:16.89]Maybe you had to reach a certain level in the beta.
[15:20.13]I mean, I very clearly did not have this stuff last time.
[15:25.13]Yeah, when I loaded in today, I got a bunch of unlocks, like a ton of cosmetics and stuff.
[15:35.13]So appearance.
[15:37.65]Yeah.
[15:37.85]Speaking of beta, the game is launched today.
[15:39.67]It's official.
[15:40.15]It's no longer, uh, it's, it is a, it is hair.
[15:43.37]It's on Steam.
[15:45.22]they did a bunch of updates too like for the launch so did they I'm excited to check out you know all the new stuff because I've been I'm level eight now I I really enjoyed playing this yeah they added like eight new levels that you can play through new missions and there's a cosmetic store that's different than the uh the armory that's awesome because that the just the more missions the better let's just see if that's there's a lot that's good
[16:10.14]Alright, so... Yeah, Greg is still on the toilet.
[16:11.87]Sorry, everybody.
[16:12.63]Oh, let me... Vinny, let me get you into the lobby.
[16:15.45]Yeah, okay.

[16:19.29]Yeah, I'm... Oh, God.
[16:21.23]Hang on.
[16:21.63]Sorry.
[16:22.27]It is... It is Steam.
[16:23.49]You have to tell... You have to tell everybody you're online.
[16:26.06]Uh-huh.
[16:30.98]Uh... What is your name?
[16:32.28]What's your name on Steam right now?
[16:34.00]Gas Can.
[16:35.26]No, it's just Vinesauce.
[16:36.71]Oh, I was like, wait... I was like, that's me?
[16:42.19]says you're offline a lot of uh a lot of uh an animosity towards Steam every time I play games with you like uh were you ready to go to the Epic Games Store we're all ready uh I don't know about that start bro okay so you should I got the invite yeah thank you alright now we're just waiting for uh Criken to finish his
[17:10.65]His bathroom routine, whatever it is.
[17:13.53]And we can get started.
[17:18.31]Which should be pretty soon.
[17:19.67]Well, I don't know.
[17:21.75]I wonder.
[17:22.51]There's been plenty of times where I've spent quite a while.
[17:26.34]Yeah.
[17:30.08]Wait, should we ask how long?
[17:31.78]How long should we stall?
[17:33.70]I'm going to laugh my ass off if he says like 40 minutes.
[17:42.92]If he just tells us what he ate, we'll know.
[17:44.66]Like, if he says White Castle or Taco Bell, we'll know.
[17:47.08]How long should we stall?
[17:53.53]You know what would be really funny?
[17:56.17]If he joined the call and flushed, like, there was a toilet flush sound.
[17:59.87]I mean, that would be pretty good.
[18:03.46]I should tell him to do that.
[18:04.78]It would be funnier if he actually never came.
[18:09.80]He's just not ever going to be here.
[18:11.64]Yeah.
[18:12.06]Sponsored to run around the hub world for 20 minutes.
[18:15.26]We're going to be playing this.
[18:17.34]Don't worry.
[18:20.72]He says he's hopping on now.
[18:21.94]Alright.
[18:23.78]Yeah.
[18:24.06]Okay.
[18:27.22]Well, hey, but last time we did this, too, getting ready.
[18:30.32]Hey, sometimes you get a group of four people together.
[18:32.06]It's actually take some time.
[18:33.82]Yeah, and it took longer last time, so this is relatively quick.
[18:36.78]This is pretty quick.
[18:37.40]We got this down to like a well-oiled machine, like Criken's bowels.
[18:41.70]Dan, Warhammer, if you're watching this right now, and you're curious, this guy's walking around in circles in the hub.
[18:46.10]What is he doing?
[18:47.65]We're just getting ready, and we're going to be good to go.
[18:49.93]It's actually part of the lore that you praise the Emperor by walking around the ship.
[18:57.71]Yeah, we did do this exact thing last time, yeah.
[19:02.83]So what new mission should we do?
[19:05.32]This new stuff, right?
[19:06.04]What should we do?
[19:07.46]And by the way, I know I'm a two-bar Andy.
[19:11.64]I know that a lot of you guys might be three or four-bar Andys.
[19:14.68]What does that mean?
[19:16.04]The level that you guys are at, like three bars, is pretty rough.
[19:18.87]Is it?
[19:19.07]Okay.
[19:20.11]You do get a lot of power through levels.
[19:22.35]Oh, you mean the difficulty.
[19:23.65]Yeah, two is good.
[19:25.25]I'm fine with two.
[19:26.21]And then if you want, maybe at the end we can attempt a three, when we're all really awesome at the game.
[19:31.47]But there's also twos that have, like, nearly infinite hordes.
[19:36.28]Right.
[19:36.44]And those are also pretty tough.
[19:39.40]Okay.
[19:40.82]Before you get all your levels up and whatnot.
[19:43.30]We'll start with two and then we'll move on to three after a few matches or something.
[19:47.31]Yeah.
[19:48.31]I think maybe we'll be good.
[19:49.65]Like, we'll be, like, well practiced.
[19:51.63]Yeah.
[19:51.97]But if not, it'll be fun for the audience to watch us fail.
[19:56.30]So what about map?
[19:57.62]Is there any of these new?
[19:59.65]I think the one on the bottom, Hab Draco, might be new.
[20:03.55]I don't think that was there.
[20:05.87]Ooh.
[20:06.71]Wait.
[20:07.35]Is this a two-star?
[20:08.59]Wait, because they had a new mission type, so that's Investigation, which I don't think was there before.
[20:12.73]Some of them are the maps that we're already in, but you do them, you go to, like, different areas of that map and do a different mission.
[20:19.46]Oh, okay.
[20:20.30]I haven't done enough yet today, so I don't, like, fully know.
[20:22.62]Hey!
[20:22.90]Hey!
[20:23.06]Hey!
[20:27.66]How are you?
[20:28.82]I'm great.
[20:29.82]Am I allowed to be here now?
[20:30.96]Yeah, sorry.
[20:32.44]I invited you, then we booted you, then I invited you again, and then you were taking a bathroom break.
[20:37.30]I'm sorry.
[20:37.68]That's my fault.
[20:38.22]That's actually all my fault.
[20:40.32]You know, I invited too many people to the party, and then too many people said yes.
[20:45.18]You all sort of said maybe on Facebook.
[20:46.68]You know what I mean?
[20:49.10]On Facebook.
[20:50.95]You guys should have all clicked maybe on Facebook instead of yes.
[20:53.49]Jerma still organizes all of his streams on Facebook.
[20:55.55]And we're begging him, please, please, any other platform, man.
[20:59.03]But he's addicted to that maybe.
[21:01.98]Will they show up?
[21:02.70]I don't know.
[21:03.52]Alright, let's get you in here, Criken.
[21:07.52]This is actually pretty great, because this is a team of players that know what they're doing, besides me.
[21:12.00]So this is gonna be great.
[21:13.53]I mean, you're level 7, you know.
[21:15.55]I got carried by, literally by Criken.
[21:20.21]Criken and Strippen literally carried.
[21:24.33]We almost beat a 5 a couple days ago.
[21:27.80]Are you online, Criken?
[21:29.84]Yeah, I'm logging in now.
[21:30.95]There you are.
[21:32.19]But we'll be doing that later tonight, I think.
[21:34.57]We're going to try to go for broke.
[21:36.93]Yeah, I was going to play this with a couple of my mods today, so this ended up working out.
[21:42.60]I was going to check out the new stuff.
[21:44.86]Criken, do you know which map for sure is new?
[21:47.34]Because we're looking at the missions.
[21:49.84]Hab Draco seems new to us.
[21:51.92]That one wasn't new.
[21:53.26]There was one up top that wasn't.
[21:54.57]It just rotated out.
[21:56.21]Oh, darn.
[21:57.59]Okay, there you are.
[21:58.97]Invite to... Oh, I can't invite you.
[22:02.77]Alright, I'm just going to cold open my stream.
[22:04.82]One sec.
[22:06.80]Man.
[22:08.18]Dave, I promise we'll play this eventually.
[22:13.78]This is the war... Okay, you know before a big theater production... Oh, you guys are theater kids like I was.
[22:19.59]Like I am.
[22:21.57]So before a show, we all sit around and we go like...
[22:30.19]And everybody just gets warmed up vocally, so then we're ready to go.
[22:33.63]Oh, okay.
[22:37.31]That sounded kind of like the Pee Wee Herman's Big Adventure theme.
[22:42.33]Jeremiah, that was a cult.
[22:51.41]No, it wasn't.
[22:55.91]It literally was.
[22:56.87]It was not!
[22:57.87]No, what are you talking about?
[22:59.39]Alright, let me see if I can get Criken in here.
[23:09.81]Alright.
[23:11.39]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for us to... Hey, look.
[23:14.45]A lot of streamers have like 15 to 20 minute countdowns on their stream.
[23:18.33]We haven't even started yet.
[23:19.01]The stream hasn't even started.
[23:19.79]We haven't even begun yet.
[23:21.33]Yeah.
[23:30.07]Yeah, I was a public access guy.
[23:31.57]I wasn't a theater guy.
[23:34.19]So we didn't really like warm up or anything.
[23:36.99]We just made terrible television with no warm up.
[23:46.19]Putting Jerma, Jerma, whatever.
[23:49.37]Whatever, yeah.
[23:50.75]So Ster, how was your day since yesterday?
[23:53.55]My day since yesterday, I've really just been having an amazing time living like the most crazy life ever.
[24:00.15]I'm gaming on a yacht right now.
[24:01.75]I'm right off the back.
[24:02.69]I can see the amazing Seattle Vista skyline.
[24:07.01]What the fuck is going on in my game?
[24:08.71]Yeah, I think once this mission starts, I'm going to hop in the helicopter and game from there.
[24:12.57]Alright.
[24:13.15]So I'm getting a million items added to my thing.
[24:16.47]Me too.
[24:17.45]And video settings got reset too.
[24:19.51]I don't know if that happened to you, but just double check that you're all good.
[24:24.62]Okay, yeah, I hit level 30, so it was like, oh yeah, here's the rest of the game, and they just updated it all at once.
[24:29.84]Yeah.
[24:30.92]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Warhammer Darktide launch event.
[24:39.04]It's here, it's on Steam, and I'm ready to queue us up.
[24:45.90]That was sick.
[24:46.94]I'd ask to do that again, but I think you nailed it the first time.
[24:50.32]Yo, what is up, guys?
[24:51.20]This is episode number two of Darktide.
[24:53.47]Stop, stop.
[24:55.74]So happy to be here.
[24:57.02]You just inspired me to sub to Jerma with that voice.
[24:59.52]Thanks.
[25:00.74]Alright.
[25:00.94]So what are we... Criken, we ask you because you're level 30, damn.
[25:07.03]Yeah.
[25:07.67]Where should we go right now?
[25:09.35]What should we do to experience the launch of the video game, you would say?
[25:12.81]Let's see.
[25:13.27]Because there's some new stuff.
[25:14.40]There's a few new areas.
[25:15.16]Yes.
[25:15.80]Refinery Delta 17 is new.
[25:18.58]Vigil Station Oblivion is new.
[25:22.90]Let's do that on level 3.
[25:25.10]Let's do the 3.
[25:26.24]Vigil Station Oblivion 3.
[25:28.32]We'll start here, you know?
[25:30.46]Let's go.
[25:32.62]At the end of the day.
[25:33.32]Okay.
[25:36.73]I'm actually really pumped.
[25:39.09]We did a 5 a few nights ago.
[25:40.73]It was like me, Gmart, Strippin, and who's the last one?
[25:49.04]I already forgot, but we got all the way to the final objective and, like, four out of five.
[25:54.67]And it was an absolute, like... It was so difficult, but so fun.
[25:59.33]I really, really like it.
[26:00.73]So what was the whole thing?
[26:02.92]Five is, like, impossible right now, right?
[26:04.90]Five is, like, insanely hard.
[26:06.76]It's super hard.
[26:07.88]It's because there's no limit to how many specials can spawn at a time.
[26:11.94]And there's just constant hordes, like...
[26:16.63]literally endless constant like just absolute room filled with enemies so you're dealing with all the enemies and also the specials and so you just have to be like super coordinated as a team and bring like the right weapons for you know whatever the mission is you have to be you have to be perfect your gear yeah pretty much and it felt but like it's also doable like if you just you know dodge and parry perfectly and don't get hit then you can you know just avoid all damage and like it's easy
[26:43.27]Yeah, G-Martin thing was level 19, actually, when we did a 5, and he still could contribute.
[26:49.32]It's doable in lower levels.
[26:50.86]You just probably need a couple 30s to carry.
[26:53.22]This is probably loud.
[26:55.63]Did I turn it way too high up?
[26:57.65]Oh, look how pretty it is.
[26:58.73]This looks like Vermintide.
[26:59.85]This does.
[27:01.27]Ooh.
[27:02.19]Oh, wow.
[27:03.07]Oh, swamp level.
[27:04.57]This is actually pretty sick.
[27:06.77]Blighttown?
[27:07.93]This is Blighttown.
[27:08.99]Also, I just gotta say, Ster, I don't know if you know this, but I literally remade the character from your D&D campaign.
[27:15.12]Yeah, of course.
[27:16.48]I had to.
[27:18.98]I love the character too much.
[27:20.16]This is literally what he looked like, so I was like, I might as well make him again.
[27:24.61]I mean, the extra emperor tattoo, but... Yeah.
[27:27.41]Yeah.
[27:28.07]Yeah.
[27:28.95]You got to praise the emperor.
[27:30.87]Looks great.
[27:31.63]You wouldn't be able to read the emperor tattoo in lore.
[27:36.78]Alright.
[27:37.16]You guys ready?
[27:38.50]This is a three bar.
[27:41.02]This is a three bar.
[27:42.08]This is my first time doing a three mission.
[27:44.46]Oh, really?
[27:45.40]Yeah.
[27:45.76]I figured let me hit level 10 and then I'll do threes, but yeah.
[27:52.38]You can handle it.
[27:53.80]I'm ready.
[27:54.30]I'm ready.
[27:55.23]We've never done this mission, so... Good luck.
[27:56.65]Stay frosty.
[27:57.07]Stay frosty.
[27:57.43]Stay.
[27:57.55]Yeah.
[27:57.65]Yeah.
[27:57.77]We got a big guy over here.
[27:59.57]Big guy.
[28:24.62]That guy's still alive?
[28:26.10]What?
[28:26.38]I thought he was dead.
[28:27.22]Yeah, yeah.
[28:29.58]Okay.
[28:34.65]Criken, what's your feeling on auto guns?
[28:36.89]Because I'm using one right now and I'm trying to figure out if I like it.
[28:40.81]Good for horde clearing.
[28:44.93]That's mostly it.
[28:46.33]I mean, it depends if you can aim down the sights and hit specials.
[28:49.44]I don't really use them that much.
[28:51.00]Okay.
[28:51.76]Yeah, because I'm not sure I'm going to stick with it, but I'm just trying it out.
[28:58.64]Also, yeah, the game just launched, and I'm sure they added a bunch of stuff, and I literally just booted up and joined this, so I've not had a chance to look at any of the new things.
[29:08.01]I don't know all the answers now.
[29:09.95]Why does he look like a bodybuilder at this angle?
[29:11.80]Holy shit, I'm keeping this angle forever.
[29:18.18]Should I, like, widen my shoulders up?
[29:20.70]You need to slowly, over time, start, like, integrating, like, Instagram filters on your webcam.
[29:26.95]But very slowly.
[29:27.83]Like, yeah, like a 5% at a time.
[29:29.85]Yeah.
[29:30.49]So people don't notice right away.
[29:31.87]And then, like, a month from now, you're just jacked.
[29:34.21]Wait, so frontline Joe built that in with channel points.
[29:37.63]And if you do a channel point redeem, you can lower the opacity of his camera by 5%.
[29:41.29]So you can slowly fade away.
[29:43.49]Watch out, sniper.
[29:55.00]Wow.
[29:55.90]What was that?
[29:57.14]Yeah, it was a firecracker.
[29:59.20]Yeah, snipers do like all of your health and damage.
[30:02.10]Yeah.
[30:03.37]I think like 90% of my deaths are, oh, there was a sniper.
[30:06.81]Somebody sniped.
[30:07.61]Ah, explosive guy.
[30:08.63]Explosive guy.
[30:09.17]Oh, we got a shield guy over here.
[30:12.91]Oh, God.
[30:15.58]Guys, we've got to learn these names eventually, man.
[30:17.29]It's called a scab bomber.
[30:22.41]Shield guy.
[30:25.45]Why could I not think?
[30:27.15]Fire guy got me.
[30:28.65]I got you.
[30:29.04]I got you.
[30:33.20]An adult.
[30:35.60]Alright, I got you.
[30:41.97]you can also when you pick people up you can hold right click to block while hooking them up oh okay he's got a chainsaw oh my god got you bad day I yeah that I need to dodge more and I need to block more because I was mainly used to shooting a lot but yeah I'll get it I'll get it
[31:07.32]Yeah, you're good.
[31:07.86]I mean, when in melee, if you're not swinging, basically just I'm holding right click for block, you know?
[31:14.10]Yeah.
[31:14.38]Gotcha.
[31:16.24]So just in between the animations, you can just throw it up in case there's an attack coming out you don't see.
[31:20.20]The block is actually amazing in this game.
[31:22.20]Yeah.
[31:23.46]It can take a lot.
[31:26.32]I think I also have a counterattack with my blade, because the other button brings it up for a second.
[31:34.32]Yeah, you can kind of mash that and throw that in between swings, too.
[31:37.02]Because it doesn't really take time to do.
[31:39.98]It just uses stamina when it triggers.
[31:42.63]Gotcha.
[31:43.67]What was that?
[31:45.51]Horde.
[31:47.91]Grenades here, lads.
[31:50.05]Oh, what is that sound?
[31:51.51]We got a mutant over here!
[31:56.29]Smush!
[31:57.57]Help!
[31:59.86]Oh, that was you.
[32:03.65]What the heck?
[32:04.67]There's another one.
[32:06.65]Alright, I gotta... I gotta get back into the game here.
[32:10.83]I've... Hey, what the heck?
[32:23.10]I don't know why I'm doing that right now.
[32:24.92]Somebody said it and it got in my head and I won't get it.
[32:27.14]It won't leave.
[32:28.64]What?
[32:29.70]Like, what the heck?
[32:31.66]Oh, yeah.
[32:31.98]I've been saying what the heck unironically for like two years now.
[32:35.59]Why is it infiltrating my head?
[32:36.81]I don't know, man.
[32:38.13]Well, that's how bro got into my vocabulary because I turned against bro because my high school was all just like, yo, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.
[32:46.49]And then the past couple of years, like people say it ironically online and I'm like, what's up, bro?
[32:51.27]Yeah, same.
[32:53.21]I've been doing that too.
[32:54.33]That's weird.
[32:54.93]Gunners down.
[32:56.93]Machine gunners down here.
[32:57.91]I'll just try to... Holy shit!
[33:21.75]Oh, I'm just dead now.
[33:25.19]I'm so sorry everyone.
[33:26.15]You're good.
[33:26.97]You're good.
[33:28.03]I thought I had way more help than that.
[33:31.73]Oh, that's bad.
[33:33.33]That's bad.
[33:33.83]I'm about to die.
[33:42.74]Oh, I'm done.
[33:47.24]Oh, that got that got hairy.
[33:53.00]I think we're okay though.
[33:56.12]I believe in you.
[34:00.48]Thank God there's two of you that are very good.
[34:05.12]I was the first to go down.
[34:06.96]Am I on that list?
[34:11.12]Yeah.
[34:12.80]Yeah.
[34:13.46]I was the problem.
[34:14.62]Oh, you were the issue.
[34:15.78]It's alright.
[34:18.14]They might have made the threes more difficult because this is definitely...
[34:22.88]How do I get up there?
[34:25.76]What the hell is that?
[34:27.67]How do I get up to Vinny?
[34:32.19]Thank you.
[34:32.73]Oh, it's this friend again.
[34:33.85]Oh, the beast.
[34:36.81]Let me get behind him.
[34:39.10]No, he ate that guy.
[34:41.04]He did eat that guy.
[34:42.92]That was great.
[35:02.01]I didn't see anything stop saying that whoa smush you just got like vom exploded
[35:30.70]Did we walk past the Medicaid?
[35:33.32]I feel like we did, right?
[35:34.36]Because there's no way there hasn't been one yet.
[35:36.64]Yeah, maybe like some random corner we missed.
[35:40.85]That was intense.
[35:43.13]Yeah, I'm looking around.
[35:47.79]Dog.
[35:48.39]Gotcha.
[35:54.29]Thank you.
[35:54.91]Oh, my goodness.
[36:00.17]Sometimes, Jerma, you'll know what I'm talking about.
[36:02.57]Yeah.
[36:03.03]Sometimes they run at you and they make like noise, but it sounds exactly like the imps from Hearthstone.
[36:08.67]And I think like someone's playing an imp and it's attacking.
[36:12.33]I hear it all the time and it like weirds me out.
[36:14.76]Dude, you know what I hear all the time?
[36:16.36]And some of you guys might know this.
[36:18.12]The Warcraft wolf sound that goes... Do you know what I mean by that?
[36:24.08]Warcraft 3?
[36:26.69]Yep.
[36:27.45]No, just like World of Warcraft, the wolves.
[36:30.59]They go... It's a very distinct sound.
[36:35.01]Okay.
[36:35.79]Alright, we have a little medication here.
[36:37.66]I think Smush should get it and either me or... Yeah, I can hold off on getting it because I, you know, I just need some regular meds.
[36:48.44]Yeah, I got some regular meds too.
[36:53.25]However, I could use ammo.
[36:54.59]If anyone finds any ammo, please let me know.
[36:58.17]Yeah, I do too.
[36:58.91]Bad.
[37:02.17]Bang.
[37:03.11]Yo.
[37:04.80]Oh my goodness.
[37:08.82]Ow.
[37:11.46]Oh no, no, no.
[37:26.19]That guy threw a grenade at his own team.
[37:28.43]What are they doing?
[37:29.23]Those are mine.
[37:31.03]Oh, oh.
[37:32.61]I'm chucking.
[37:33.77]I generate a lot of grenades, so I just throw them around.
[37:38.17]Okay, I got a Grim War.
[37:39.99]I can't stick my head out here.
[37:42.83]There's a gunner out there.
[37:50.01]That's bad.
[37:52.53]We can dodge this, guys.
[37:53.38]Check it out.
[37:54.96]That was sick.
[37:59.74]Did I do that?
[38:00.26]I'm okay.
[38:01.04]I'm fine.
[38:01.36]I don't know.
[38:01.96]It's fine.
[38:02.60]I'm alright.
[38:04.05]I'm sorry.
[38:04.45]I just Steve Urkel'd, by the way.
[38:07.87]Did I do that?
[38:09.51]Oh, my God.
[38:10.03]Alright.
[38:18.00]That sniper just walked up into melee.
[38:20.20]He walked up, started reloading, and then was like, wait.
[38:22.78]Wait a minute.
[38:23.88]Wrong class.
[38:27.31]Thought I was on my other character.
[38:29.61]That's a lot of people.
[38:36.41]This is going well for a three.
[38:38.15]Yeah, it actually is.
[38:39.67]Not bad.
[38:40.45]He's still alive.
[38:44.70]Oh, ammo.
[38:48.71]Thank goodness.
[38:49.47]That guy's still alive.
[38:50.89]Dude, I keep smushing this guy's head.
[38:53.17]He won't die.
[38:54.41]Is he?
[38:55.03]Alright.
[39:18.75]Alright.
[39:19.21]Oh, I can drop some healing.
[39:20.05]Let's do that.
[39:22.09]Oh, yes.
[39:22.91]Is this a sponsored stream or can we say dick?
[39:25.45]I mean, you could.
[39:27.97]You're a prisoner.
[39:28.73]Oh, you're already killed.
[39:30.47]You could.
[39:32.11]Minus 20 bucks for each time dick is said.
[39:36.47]You should do that, dude.
[39:37.45]Like a swear jar for sponsored streams.
[39:39.55]Yeah.
[39:39.93]Yeah.
[39:40.57]Darktide is like a really family friendly.
[39:42.69]There's nothing weird at all.
[39:45.81]No disturbing themes.
[39:48.44]In fact, Warhammer is for the whole family.
[39:50.12]Yeah.
[39:53.06]This guy!
[39:53.74]Come on!
[39:55.02]Die already!
[40:04.94]Alright.
[40:06.29]Uh oh, we all can heal here.
[40:08.05]I'm dead.
[40:22.05]Alright, so now... Yeah, this is perfect.
[40:30.25]We need all of this.
[40:31.55]It's got four.
[40:32.35]Yeah, four.
[40:34.07]Oh, perfect.
[40:34.67]Yeah, but I need to do it twice.
[40:41.25]It's my character's fatal flaw that he has to heal twice every time he heals.
[40:45.27]Sorry, guys.
[40:45.79]I don't make the rules.
[40:48.69]What, um... Was there no ammo crates?
[40:53.93]No, I didn't see anything.
[40:55.13]There's one tiny one up here.
[40:57.40]Who has no ammo?
[40:59.24]Oh, is this the right?
[40:59.90]This is the way forward, I think.
[41:00.88]Are you sure?
[41:01.24]How much ammo do you have?
[41:03.54]A little bit.
[41:04.28]I'll just melee.
[41:05.22]I have to get better at melee anyway.
[41:06.72]Biff!
[41:07.40]Oh, shit.
[41:07.86]Sorry.
[41:08.61]I was going to give it to you.
[41:09.55]Is that a sneeze?
[41:10.21]What was that?
[41:10.83]I just accidentally clicked.
[41:11.95]Just yelled Biff.
[41:16.27]That was like a very clear enunciation.
[41:19.41]Biff!
[41:20.61]Wait, what did you think I said?
[41:22.18]Biff!
[41:24.42]Hey, Biff!
[41:25.74]What did you say?
[41:27.19]I sneezed.
[41:29.51]That was like a fake sneeze.
[41:31.33]Someone sneezes just goes, Biff!
[41:34.75]Why would that come through like that?
[41:36.09]I don't know.
[41:37.31]It's exactly what it sounded like.
[41:38.50]I'm not making it up.
[41:39.18]Try a grenade.
[41:51.42]Nice.
[41:53.32]You think everyone on Earth has a unique sneeze, like a snowflake?
[41:57.68]Kind of.
[41:59.56]I have a duck sneeze.
[42:01.00]I smell like a duck when I sneeze.
[42:03.38]Yeah.
[42:03.76]I don't know what that thing's called.
[42:11.75]Dog.
[42:12.37]Call it by its correct name or I'm not helping you.
[42:14.87]What is this, scab dog?
[42:16.77]Scab dog.
[42:18.15]Hey, what's up?
[42:20.73]A flesh rot.
[42:23.87]A most holy grenade.
[42:26.04]Ooh, actually, I don't I wish this was ammo.
[42:28.40]Runs for me.
[42:29.48]Ammo.
[42:30.34]Mind the safe for ridden.
[42:32.12]I've heard it.
[42:34.16]Anyone need grenades?
[42:34.92]Hey.
[42:37.34]Oh yeah, this part of the map has a weird song.
[42:40.97]A weird song.
[42:42.23]I heard that.
[42:43.05]Yeah, I don't know what it was.
[42:45.25]I'm still confused.
[42:47.85]It is a different song.
[42:51.60]Gotta go cyber-psycho on these guys.
[42:54.42]Whoa.
[42:54.64]Time to crumb up.
[42:55.48]Time to crumb up, Choom.
[43:01.23]Ooh, I kinda like it.
[43:02.35]Guys, I'm not good at this.
[43:06.75]I'm being attacked up here by someone with armor.
[43:08.85]Come, come, come, go, go, go, go.
[43:12.27]Like, I tried to dodge and block.
[43:14.11]I was failing.
[43:14.63]I was bad at it.
[43:15.65]So, um...
[43:21.80]I don't know if they changed it for the launch, but in the beta, your class spinning gets the strongest melee weapon in the game at like high level.
[43:30.36]So that's kind of when your melee pops off.
[43:32.30]I don't know if you have a whole lot of melee stuff before then.
[43:35.68]I only have the most basic stuff.
[43:37.20]I'm not really crazy about it.
[43:38.54]Yeah, I felt like when I leveled and got past level 10, I just suddenly got a million more options and it was a lot.
[43:46.25]Help!
[43:46.79]Are you my class too, sir?
[43:48.25]Help!
[43:48.55]I don't know what am I doing over here?
[43:52.78]What am I doing over here?
[43:53.60]Why am I so far away?
[43:54.96]You just ran backwards.
[43:56.90]Alright.
[43:58.66]Oh, you found it.
[44:01.62]Oh, no.
[44:02.18]Okay, so this mission's a weird one.
[44:03.58]We have to use... Press 4.
[44:05.67]You take out a little Game Boy.
[44:07.25]And then we go to scan different things in the area.
[44:12.79]Shit!
[44:14.11]I got grabbed.
[44:15.73]I'm getting smushed.
[44:16.45]I'm busy.
[44:19.12]You're gonna have to deal with that on your own.
[44:30.00]Okay, I got one.
[44:32.90]Nice.
[44:33.91]Nice, that was huge.
[44:34.95]Got two.
[44:40.95]You got two already?
[44:42.37]Alright, now if I can, uh, yeah.
[44:44.49]Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:50.63]Where is this guy going?
[44:52.29]What the hell?
[44:53.71]He lives to trap another day.
[44:55.68]I do like that they actually leave.
[44:57.14]Like, they miss.
[44:57.64]They're like, oh, fuck.
[44:58.66]I'm out of here.
[45:03.87]Another one.
[45:04.21]Oh, he's just hanging.
[45:07.88]He's just hanging over there.
[45:09.10]Here he comes.
[45:10.36]What was he doing?
[45:11.98]What were you thinking?
[45:12.80]Grimoire over here.
[45:14.18]Oh, shit.
[45:15.22]Really?
[45:16.12]Yeah, Grimoire.
[45:16.86]Are we feeling brave?
[45:17.96]I'll pick it up.
[45:19.64]What do you guys think?
[45:21.54]Dog.
[45:23.82]Dog dead.
[45:24.64]Not dead.
[45:25.08]Dog alive.
[45:26.23]No, I'm about to die if I die Parma.
[45:29.43]I'm gonna drop a grimoire.
[45:30.85]Oh, that's shit.
[45:31.73]Alright, they're coming.
[45:32.35]It's gone for good They're coming.
[45:33.39]They're coming.
[45:33.79]They're coming.
[45:34.17]They're coming.
[45:34.73]It's gone for good now Dog on me.
[45:38.11]Yeah, usually want like the tanky people pick them up Fuck they keep using that same exit strategy Smart-ass dog
[45:50.32]The dog's still alive.
[45:51.82]He's roughing at me.
[45:53.88]Don't forget to use the... It's the bodies in here.
[46:02.49]Oh, thank God.
[46:03.71]I just... Oh, okay.
[46:07.93]We need ammo, don't we?
[46:08.75]Does everybody need it?
[46:10.49]You got it.
[46:11.74]It's an ammo case.
[46:13.38]I do.
[46:13.70]Yeah, drop it.
[46:14.18]Yeah, I'll put it down.
[46:17.41]I'm back.
[46:18.07]Thank you.
[46:19.45]Who's doing that?
[46:21.75]What the fuck?
[46:23.99]I'm dead.
[46:24.31]For real dead.
[46:27.65]I'm sorry.
[46:28.01]I'm screaming too much.
[46:43.31]It's a stressful situation.
[46:44.35]Dude, I had a large coffee this morning.
[46:46.45]I'm sorry.
[46:53.13]Oh my god.
[46:53.83]Okay, are we alright?
[46:58.79]We're okay.
[47:00.75]Thank you for saving me.
[47:01.89]I'm prisoner.
[47:02.95]You're welcome.
[47:04.15]Make sure to get the ammo.
[47:05.99]That's super smart.
[47:06.81]If you guys didn't get the ammo, make sure you get it.
[47:08.55]You didn't hear my whole backstory.
[47:09.85]It's a whole thing.
[47:10.89]Hey, if nobody got it, seriously.
[47:14.22]Alright, we have one more.
[47:17.44]I think that's where Vinny is right now.
[47:19.00]I'll lead the way.
[47:24.12]I do like this music.
[47:25.22]This whole game has had good music, but I just like how weird and cindy it is.
[47:29.56]Oh, I'm being attacked.
[47:34.74]I just pressed F instead of E. How dare I?
[47:40.66]I'm throwing.
[47:42.05]Oh my god.
[47:43.63]God damn it.
[47:44.23]That's going to be the reason why we lose.
[47:45.37]Because of that.
[47:46.99]Because I pressed F. Oh my god.
[47:58.40]You know what it is?
[48:00.86]It's that I have an axe, and axes are not good for crowd control, right?
[48:06.28]Yeah, they're really bad for crowd control.
[48:08.90]I have an axe.
[48:10.44]They're good at single target, and then I have this charge gun.
[48:14.01]It's good at single target.
[48:14.85]And then I'm getting hoarded.
[48:17.07]Ah, they're coming from behind here.
[48:18.85]I feel like I'm inside the game right now.
[48:20.73]Is my music too loud?
[48:24.30]It gets in your head.
[48:25.19]You're definitely very immersive.
[48:28.07]They're shooting at us.
[48:29.55]Is this the pile of bodies?
[48:30.69]Was it here this whole time?
[48:32.29]Oh, my God.
[48:32.79]It was.
[48:33.21]Alright.
[48:34.01]Head back, guys.
[48:34.59]We did it.
[48:37.51]We got to head back?
[48:38.31]Okay.
[48:41.53]Yeah.
[48:42.42]I'm not doing that.
[48:44.14]I thought that was you, Ster, for a second hitting me.
[48:47.04]Oh, yeah.
[48:47.22]It's me, Prisoner.
[48:48.78]I get that a lot.
[48:50.96]Has anyone ever called you Ster Fry?
[48:54.04]Uh, no.
[48:55.94]Can I?
[48:56.48]How did I miss?
[48:58.08]Sometimes when I make a Ster fry, they'll say, Ster fry.
[49:01.02]And then they'll do like a wink.
[49:06.69]Oh my god, it hurts.
[49:11.11]I just took a hundred bullets in the head.
[49:12.85]Thank you so much.
[49:17.33]You need to use the stealth mechanic more.
[49:20.24]We just gotta run.
[49:21.08]Oh, that was a lie.
[49:21.74]They just crouched, dude.
[49:24.28]I'm taking all my anger out on you.
[49:27.44]See, look at how much I just fucked that guy up.
[49:29.02]Just threw him, yeah.
[49:30.78]There was a lot of anger behind that.
[49:32.40]Oh, they should make like a melee thing for the Ogryn where you just grab someone by the face with this giant palm and just chucks them.
[49:41.43]Use them as a range weapon.
[49:45.77]Where's that guy going?
[49:46.53]That guy's just running.
[49:47.53]Why are we all laughing at this guy?
[49:50.19]I need to kill him.
[50:09.97]I can't hit that.
[50:10.63]Yeah, next time let's call the elevator before... Smush.
[50:23.34]Oh!
[50:25.14]He's just bloodthirsty.
[50:26.14]Listen, I know you're just fiending to kill, but we're good.
[50:33.16]Jerma's bloodlust knows no boundaries.
[50:37.07]Bloodthirsty.
[50:45.55]Dog coming in.
[50:50.29]I love the acting in this game.
[50:53.23]The voice acting is so good.
[50:56.13]Ouch, ouch, ouch.
[51:00.48]Ouch, ouch, ouch.
[51:11.00]Put him down.
[51:11.62]Oh shit, there's so many over here.
[51:27.37]Did your guy actually just start going nom, nom, nom, nom?
[51:30.19]Am I crazy?
[51:31.87]What?
[51:32.29]Special.
[51:34.14]Enemy.
[51:34.68]Okay.
[51:35.56]Special enemy.
[51:36.20]I don't know what to call it.
[51:38.00]It just devolved into it.
[51:39.08]No idea what these things are.
[51:40.46]Special enemy.
[51:43.65]Ammo over here.
[51:44.25]If anyone needs it.
[51:46.17]Special enemy.
[51:50.16]I could hear the strain in your brain trying to get the words out.
[51:52.80]I can't even rack my brain appropriately because I'm just scared.
[52:02.69]Oh, look how pretty this is.
[52:03.69]Yeah, this looks great.
[52:05.97]Do not walk up to that thing.
[52:10.11]It's gonna be like a... It's the icy ground.
[52:12.73]Just walk around it.
[52:13.45]Don't look at it.
[52:15.83]What?
[52:16.25]You did it.
[52:17.09]Oh, no.
[52:17.81]Should we run?
[52:18.53]Don't shoot it.
[52:18.89]Don't shoot it.
[52:19.59]Just run.
[52:20.31]Wait.
[52:20.51]There's ammo over here.
[52:21.97]Oh, we're not okay.
[52:23.53]It's bad.
[52:27.57]Oh, my God.
[52:28.03]It's on Jerma.
[52:30.80]Wait, did I aggro it?
[52:33.84]I thought it was already aggroed.
[52:34.92]I thought we already aggroed it.
[52:35.76]It was just waking up and then you kept going into it.
[52:38.25]I thought it was already aggroed.
[52:41.45]Oh, he's on me now.
[52:42.55]This is bad.
[52:44.55]It leaves after it kills two, I think.
[52:46.61]Yeah, but I'm trying not to die if I can help it.
[52:49.57]I thought it was already aggroed, so I thought it was safe to get the ammo because I thought, fuck, we're going to fight it anyways.
[52:53.32]Okay.
[52:54.42]We got it.
[52:56.20]Nice.
[52:56.78]Well, actually, technically, you got it, Criken.
[52:59.51]Oh, cool.
[53:00.32]It said Copernicus got the kill, so.
[53:02.78]Yeah, I'm a bleed build, so.
[53:05.58]Oh, that makes sense.
[53:06.42]That was the, hey, this icy ground over here and every person in the party, I just watched like this.
[53:11.18]Was this it?
[53:12.28]We just walked on in.
[53:14.08]Slips on ice.
[53:15.05]For my defense, I thought it was already aggroed to the party.
[53:21.09]Yeah, yeah.
[53:22.05]In my defense, I actually, I acted perfectly and appropriately, which gives me the high ground here.
[53:27.69]Hey, remember when you died first that time and said it was all your fault that we almost lost?
[53:30.93]I was being nice to Vinny.
[53:37.52]It's not so nice to reveal that, but I'll take it.
[53:39.76]That's very rude to reveal right now.
[53:41.64]If you're going to aim your gun at me, I'm going to pull out all my firearms.
[53:45.99]But Vinny didn't... I... You should have made... You should have talked shit about me.
[53:50.27]You... Like, from my perspective, you are, like, vouching for Vinny because I don't really know him.
[53:55.03]From my perspective?
[53:55.68]I'm going to attack your friend.
[53:57.76]From my perspective?
[53:59.70]Yeah.
[54:00.14]Like, you two are on, like, one side, and I'm not a part of it.
[54:06.18]Can't we all be on the same team?
[54:07.94]No, no.
[54:08.76]We're a part of it now, Star.
[54:09.88]We're all in this together, buddy.
[54:11.37]Come on.
[54:11.81]Alright.
[54:12.67]And we all agree.
[54:13.77]You're my aggro.
[54:14.75]Oh, thank God.
[54:15.11]The boss.
[54:17.36]I mean, technically, it was free aggroed already, and I just fall on aggro.
[54:26.02]It has two phases of aggro, where it's crying like a witch, and then it stands up and goes... And then, yeah.
[54:32.08]Okay, now you know.
[54:33.76]Alright.
[54:35.36]So you aggroed phase two.
[54:36.74]So I'll go 50-50 on somebody for the loss there.
[54:40.78]Yeah, I was the first one aggroed, so I'll take the first 50.
[54:42.81]What?
[54:44.57]Oh my god.
[54:45.43]Did you see that?
[54:46.47]What did you just do?
[54:48.81]What the hell?
[54:50.45]Vinny, it's remarkable that you grabbed the banister.
[54:54.05]I don't.
[54:54.63]My character's reflexes are like... That was like a gymnast before he started.
[55:00.31]Are they like precogs?
[55:01.53]Like people that have like... We can't.
[55:02.83]Yeah, right?
[55:03.41]Like psychokinesis and stuff?
[55:05.13]Okay, let's do it and immediately be ready to go smush.
[55:08.38]I think it's going to start a bridge, right?
[55:09.54]Yeah.
[55:09.86]Can I play?
[55:13.42]We're working on it, man.
[55:15.45]Maybe don't die next time.
[55:20.99]Uh-oh.
[55:22.07]No, no, no, I'm good.
[55:25.15]I think I'm good.
[55:25.79]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[55:27.67]There he is.
[55:29.37]Oh, you squishy little boy.
[55:30.91]Just keep going backwards.
[55:32.59]Yeah, I'm going to go backwards and attack, and I'll just thank you for the grenade.
[55:35.49]That helps.
[55:37.53]Untie me, little one.
[55:44.25]Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[55:46.39]Little one.
[55:51.45]Interrogate the security stacks.
[55:56.56]Holy shit.
[55:58.36]It's a whole thing.
[55:59.46]Yeah, I think this is like, um... No, there's one more thing.
[56:04.92]I think a skull.
[56:09.95]It's actually a servo skull.
[56:12.57]Come on, dude.
[56:13.67]Technically, the consciousness is sometimes still attached to the servo skull.
[56:18.23]Listen, I can tell you everything about the Blade Runner universe.
[56:21.23]It's only two movies.
[56:22.97]It's easy.
[56:26.44]Name every Blade Runner.
[56:31.78]Is that the one with the vampires?
[56:34.80]Oh my God, Ster.
[56:37.67]I fell asleep during the new Blade Runner in theaters.
[56:39.93]You fell asleep during Blade Runner?
[56:43.45]I saw like 30% of that movie.
[56:46.83]But every once in a while, like dramatically in a scene, it has like a big like, I woke up like a bunch of times and instantly I went right back to bed.
[56:54.63]So why did you go see the movie so tired?
[56:59.79]uh I don't remember the circumstances you were just like exhausted I don't think I was tired I think the movie made me tired wow that's so okay I that's I saw I saw the first part of the movie that's crazy I went to see we need help mad max theory road after hell yeah pulling in over 24 hours with my friends and we like just showed up the movie like completely bleary-eyed
[57:27.77]I do love Mad Max Fury Road.
[57:29.26]I think it was made better that I was so sleep deprived.
[57:32.50]Every single rumble in the theater, I felt like it was rocking me to bed.
[57:41.72]I'm trying to think if there's ever been a movie that I've fallen asleep to in the theater.
[57:45.23]I don't think so.
[57:46.43]Yeah, I don't think I have either.
[57:48.07]Not in the theater, but at home plenty.
[57:50.25]Yeah.
[57:53.33]I was watching Scorsese's last movie, The Irishman.
[57:57.33]It's like four hours.
[57:58.20]I fell asleep like five times.
[57:59.78]Wow.
[58:01.08]But, you know, just to resume.
[58:03.18]Sorry, we're supposed to talk about Warhammer, right?
[58:04.78]Sorry.
[58:05.32]Yes.
[58:05.54]Scorsese's Warhammer.
[58:08.54]Right.
[58:09.28]There's another one of his lost movies.
[58:10.70]It's actually a huge 40K fan.
[58:13.57]Starring The Rock, right?
[58:18.29]You got into that one?
[58:23.33]he's in the jungle and he's wearing like a tight brown t-shirt someone like doesn't say something kindly about the emperor and he does the eyebrow and the crowd is like what yeah he did it you know it's about to go down
[58:47.78]I'm surprised.
[58:48.60]Has there ever been a Warhammer movie or TV show or anything in the universe?
[58:52.69]No, we can't talk about this anymore because Jerma did the loud music over our conversation indicating he wants us to stop.
[58:58.85]That was the awesome music.
[58:59.95]Oh, like wrap it up, right?
[59:00.77]Yeah.
[59:01.23]Like enough.
[59:02.07]Like at the award ceremony.
[59:03.37]I'm not enjoying this conversation.
[59:04.63]That was also the Rock's theme song, and I was just being a part of the group.
[59:09.72]Rock has a theme song?
[59:10.96]Yes.
[59:11.90]Oh, oh, oh.
[59:12.60]No.
[59:12.88]Yeah, I know that one.
[59:16.14]Never mind.
[59:16.54]Sorry.
[59:17.48]It's me, the rock.
[59:22.66]He's like, you can't see me.
[59:23.83]And then he raises his eyebrow and gives you the people's fist.
[59:26.39]This is going to be sick.
[59:27.57]This is going to be sick.
[59:29.27]This is going to be sick.
[59:32.75]It was.
[59:35.69]Don't blow up, though.
[59:38.95]Oh!
[59:39.13]Well, I blew up.
[59:41.59]Behind you, Copernicus.
[59:43.16]I blowed up real good.
[59:49.10]Stay with the group!
[59:50.46]Sir, it'd be great if we wiped this because of hounds too.
[59:55.91]The correct end for Copernicus.
[59:57.33]I got it.
[59:58.37]True.
[60:02.03]A hound takes you down in a pit of fire.
[60:06.26]Alright, I'm gonna come over here.
[60:18.38]It took me a minute to even realize.
[60:20.64]Sorry about that.
[60:22.88]Were you muted?
[60:24.28]No, I was checking my phone.
[60:33.59]Five minutes till your birthday?
[60:36.89]We've got to celebrate it.
[60:39.03]Are you serious?
[60:40.09]Somebody in chat, we've got to celebrate it.
[60:41.27]It's five minutes till your birthday.
[60:42.33]We've got to celebrate it.
[60:43.01]Are you serious?
[60:43.97]You want to celebrate by playing more Warhammer?
[60:46.61]Yeah.
[60:48.57]5 minutes.
[60:48.83]Alright.
[60:49.05]4 o'clock Pacific.
[61:00.13]Alrighty then.
[61:01.75]We go here?
[61:03.91]Looks like.
[61:04.67]We got another... We got another thing.
[61:06.27]I think it's one more.
[61:12.14]New objective.
[61:13.00]Escape.
[61:13.68]Wait.
[61:13.88]Okay.
[61:14.06]This button should not be lit up.
[61:15.04]That's a fake button.
[61:15.68]Let's go this way.
[61:16.78]Fake button.
[61:17.14]Fake button.
[61:17.48]Fake button.
[61:17.82]Everyone fake.
[61:18.29]Oh, okay.
[61:19.01]Fake button.
[61:19.73]Fake button.
[61:21.39]Yeah.
[61:21.79]It's lit up for some reason, but we don't actually have to use it.
[61:24.61]Oh.
[61:28.81]We just got to go.
[61:30.05]Yeah.
[61:30.39]We just leave.
[61:34.95]Ow.
[61:41.75]We are leaving, soldiers.
[61:53.00]It's the same developers as Vermintide.
[61:54.56]It is!
[61:55.16]It is the same developers.
[61:56.30]It's also available right now on Steam.
[61:59.92]Launch day.
[62:00.86]Currently available.
[62:11.12]Just came out of beta.
[62:12.08]It's available.
[62:12.56]Get it on Steam.
[62:14.12]Getting all these freaking rewards.
[62:17.64]Plus 20 bucks.
[62:20.18]You know, music artist is Jesper Kidd.
[62:22.60]He makes a lot of my favorite video game music.
[62:26.91]Jesper Kidd.
[62:27.87]He's done Vermintide.
[62:28.91]He did some Assassin's Creed.
[62:31.03]He did Borderlands.
[62:33.37]It might have only been one of the DLCs.
[62:35.09]I think it was all of Borderlands.
[62:38.81]Some of the Vermintide music goes super hard.
[62:43.37]Hitman games.
[62:44.60]I'm telling you, the Vermintide.
[62:45.68]Hitman games?
[62:46.64]Yeah.
[62:47.40]Love that stuff.
[62:49.22]That, when the rats are about to rush with a horde, I'm telling you, it's one of my favorite sound effects, favorite pieces of any video game in history.
[62:58.10]You hear them all, like, screaming and you hear the tide coming towards you.
[63:01.78]Just something about it.
[63:02.94]It's that, like, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.
[63:07.06]They're, like, chanting.
[63:08.16]It's terrifying.
[63:10.88]It's one of my favorite things.
[63:11.86]I didn't even play Vermintide that much.
[63:13.53]It really is still one of my favorite things.
[63:18.35]This game, whenever you fight the captain...
[63:23.48]I just, like, mute everything.
[63:25.11]Turn the music up.
[63:26.61]Yeah.
[63:27.79]That's the perfect look.
[63:33.05]Alright, so I gotta buy some new stuff.
[63:36.35]Do I get Twitch drops if I'm watching your stream, Jerma, but it's paused?
[63:42.65]Do you get drops?
[63:43.59]I don't know.
[63:43.91]That's a good question.
[63:44.45]Do you get drops?
[63:45.87]Yeah, I was, like, just to check your chat and stuff.
[63:48.52]But I can unpause it to give you...
[63:51.04]I think it has to be unpaused.
[63:52.46]I think you have to be, like, watch time.
[63:55.02]Drop it down to 240p.
[63:56.98]Got a backpack.
[63:58.14]Minimize.
[63:58.96]Okay.
[64:01.92]I got you in 160p right now, Jerma, and you look like I've got a Vaseline filter over your screen.
[64:08.15]Hold on.
[64:10.51]Tell me how it looks now.
[64:12.85]Let me see.
[64:15.19]Um.
[64:18.61]Really?
[64:20.74]Because I didn't do anything.
[64:22.18]I just leaned back.
[64:23.96]Oh, okay.
[64:25.16]Oh, what's this?
[64:28.66]Kubrick stare.
[64:36.01]I hate to do this to you guys, but do you have a favorite Kubrick movie?
[64:42.35]I don't know.
[64:42.77]I'd have to list them out.
[64:46.75]Gotcha.
[64:47.21]Because there wasn't very many, right?
[64:49.93]No, not too many.
[64:50.56]There was only, like, what?
[64:52.52]Like, seven, eight?
[64:53.44]Something like that?
[64:53.98]Ten?
[64:54.30]Oh, like ten.
[64:55.04]Ten, yeah.
[64:58.06]Alright, let me go to the... Is the armory available?
[65:00.42]Yeah.
[65:02.44]Yeah, the armory's available.
[65:03.30]There's also... My first time seeing these microtransactions.
[65:05.99]You get, like, Gucci pants for the zealot dude.
[65:08.47]What is this?
[65:10.29]Ahoy!
[65:11.37]I'm Commodore Hallowell.
[65:14.68]I want a hellbore laser gun.
[65:16.68]I hear that one's good.
[65:19.74]They're really fun.
[65:21.16]I've been using it a lot, but it gets hard to aim at things.
[65:25.58]Oh, really?
[65:25.98]It's like iron sights, and then also the front of your gun glows red.
[65:30.35]But it's a really fun gun.
[65:31.41]I want these.
[65:31.91]I've got 2,500 gamer coins.
[65:32.57]Yeah, I do.
[65:33.35]Cool.
[65:33.61]Let me look at these.
[65:47.53]Jacket.
[65:49.49]Ooh.
[65:49.81]Okay, I got the Hellbore.
[65:52.75]I'm going to upgrade it and see if I like it.
[65:55.13]Alright.
[65:55.87]It is somebody's birthday.
[65:56.93]Happy birthday.
[65:57.51]What was their name?
[65:59.14]Happy birthday, Isaac.
[66:01.08]Happy birthday, Isaac.
[66:03.98]Happy birthday, Isaac.
[66:06.24]Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[66:07.40]Yeah.
[66:11.23]and yes uh those chat members barry lyndon is my favorite kubrick movie I didn't alright I don't know why I'm an idiot I need some Criken knowledge they added they added percentage numbers to the uh the sliders on the stats for weapons I don't think that they had the number there before oh yeah the number's new yeah I I guess you wouldn't know then maybe because it's like
[66:38.67]50 seems average and it very rarely goes above 50 it's so as it was explained to me the eye level like the rating of the item itself is how much value is then randomly distributed amongst these different uh you know what the hell is this thing have you seen any that are actually like one of the bars is almost full um my
[67:04.21]Pistol is 79% full on damage and 74% on mobility.
[67:10.15]So it's like, I think like Pokémon, if you ever played that, like distribution, right?
[67:18.22]I was just wondering, because like every item that I've seen and have is like, it doesn't go beyond 54%.
[67:26.29]Yeah, same here for Yeah, I think it'll get higher as you get more.
[67:30.35]So this, I just unlocked the second row, I guess, of items that I can get a charm or something.
[67:38.65]Yeah, so curious, you can equip and it will.
[67:44.23]You can like get additional experience per level, you can get additional money because it has a blessing and a perk.
[67:51.58]It's like blessings and then perk.
[67:54.21]Should I buy this?
[67:56.79]You can buy them.
[67:58.83]There's currently a bug apparently that if your toughness, if you buy a toughness trinket and it goes above 100, it doesn't actually protect your health like it's supposed to.
[68:07.41]So I'm actually having to unequip them on my guy.
[68:09.86]But other than that, I think it's good for grinding experience and good for grinding money even.
[68:21.97]I don't think... Maybe I should get another weapon.
[68:25.09]What do I got?
[68:25.61]Is this thing better than what I have?
[68:33.85]Yeah, I got the Hellbore laser and I upgraded it to blue.
[68:37.38]So I'm hoping I like it.
[68:39.46]Because otherwise that would have been a bad choice.
[68:42.18]I'm going to try this.
[68:48.32]plus one wound means you can go down one more time oh wait I can be downed twice yeah and on the higher difficulties we start off with less wounds so it's good for um yeah limiting how much times you go down or for higher difficulties you need plus wound trinkets that's cool I'm gonna try this looks cool it's like a I think I tried this once maybe before
[69:17.63]That's a good question.
[69:18.39]When do we get the Warhammer?
[69:22.13]I already have it.
[69:23.05]Zealots get the Warhammer.
[69:24.41]No!
[69:25.61]No!
[69:26.95]Time to re-roll.
[69:30.15]It's pretty fun.
[69:33.95]Alright, cool.
[69:34.29]So you beat the game then?
[69:36.16]Yeah.
[69:37.46]Well, no, you have to collect 40,000 Warhammers, actually.
[69:40.04]It's kind of a grind.
[69:41.22]So what else is new?
[69:45.16]Let's see.
[69:45.82]We got...
[69:49.28]I think we handled that pretty well.
[69:52.96]Oh, no, that's not... I don't think that's new, actually.
[69:56.24]We can handle a three.
[69:56.92]I mean, we just did handle a three.
[69:58.12]I mean, it was a little hairy, but we did it.
[70:00.06]Yeah.
[70:00.24]Do you want to do another hairy three?
[70:02.46]Yeah, now that we have a little practice and we know how to, like, shoot better and stuff, I think we can do another three.
[70:08.60]That's so much money.
[70:09.72]You get 14,000, 15,000 gold to do a four.
[70:13.62]It's not much.
[70:17.15]Let me know what you guys think of my new drip.
[70:19.76]Yeah, me too.
[70:25.12]Oh, nice.
[70:28.61]Yo, nice goggles, Smush.
[70:31.87]What they were saying earlier in the other group, your mask is avoiding your hair.
[70:35.71]Yeah.
[70:37.55]It's the perfect haircut for this mask.
[70:41.12]I think it's the other way around.
[70:42.10]Your hair is avoiding your mask.
[70:43.54]Yeah, you are completely comfortable in that thing.
[70:45.80]Yeah.
[70:48.72]Alright, lads.
[70:51.79]Get ready.
[70:53.79]Why do I do the BatChest face?
[70:55.31]I know I do it, and it's annoying to me.
[70:57.91]You do?
[70:58.69]I do.
[70:58.99]I go like... If I put glasses on, I'm just the BatChest.
[71:15.86]I want a pistol.
[71:20.73]so how does this oops okay no alright so yeah I've used this before it has a stab so just confirm everybody the audio levels music chat everything sounds good sometimes it's hard to tell when uh yeah that's an issue I have too I always have to confirm it's such a streamer paranoia thing
[71:42.90]it is Jerma there were okay so I do a lot of pre-recorded stuff too and um I was having an issue with my sound drivers and my uh card and I recorded several full two hour long like segments with bad audio that I could not fix and and two times I had to like redo my commentary that's the that's the worst you don't record it on like separate audio tracks
[72:09.59]No, no, no.
[72:10.83]You know, I was pre-recording like just kind of a let's play kind of thing.
[72:14.27]And yeah, it was like, yeah, it was separate audio, but my voice was totally ruined.
[72:18.93]Oh.
[72:19.99]Because like, it's my VST hosts.
[72:29.07]So I'll give you an example.
[72:29.91]I sounded like, I sounded like this.
[72:33.88]I was like, hey, what's up, guys?
[72:34.96]Today we're going to be doing... What the hell?
[72:39.22]That sounds great.
[72:40.27]You sound like you're coming out of an old arcade cabinet.
[72:43.73]Yeah, it really does.
[72:44.39]It's like a pinball machine.
[72:46.03]Hey, everyone.
[72:46.67]It's me, Vinny.
[72:47.21]We're going to play some video games.
[72:48.59]My audio sounds normal, right?
[72:49.93]Let's all turn it on.
[72:50.69]Everybody do it.
[72:51.45]Let's all turn it on for like a little bit.
[72:53.25]What do you mean turn it on?
[72:54.29]Everybody turn it on for a minute.
[72:56.31]Just turn it on.
[72:57.39]I always have it.
[72:58.53]Okay.
[73:00.02]Yeah, I turn mine on.
[73:01.68]What the hell is that?
[73:04.62]Who is talking right now?
[73:06.04]Kermit the Frog here.
[73:08.37]Kermit the Frog?
[73:09.73]Dude, you just sounded like just a real different guy.
[73:14.01]Yeah.
[73:14.43]Do that again.
[73:14.89]I'm a bit cracked when it comes to voices.
[73:16.31]Do it again.
[73:16.77]Alright.
[73:17.13]Yes, sir.
[73:17.59]Alright.
[73:19.35]I'm going to do this for the rest of the level now.
[73:22.73]All you got to do is really strain your jowls.
[73:26.57]You just sound like a different person.
[73:28.77]Strain your jowls.
[73:31.19]Force the air out the mouth.
[73:33.38]That's a chat member name.
[73:35.28]If anyone needs it, strain your jowls.
[73:37.64]Oh, fuck.
[73:38.16]Oh, demon host.
[73:39.84]Don't shoot it.
[73:40.73]You know what?
[73:41.25]I had homework this week to do that.
[73:43.37]I was not training my jowl.
[73:46.05]Ow!
[73:46.21]Uh-oh.
[73:48.79]You did it to me?
[73:49.93]I didn't do it this time.
[73:51.04]Nobody make fun of me.
[73:52.70]Yeah.
[73:52.94]That was Jerma.
[73:54.58]Well, it's trying to eat me now, so... It was probably me, everybody, because I didn't know what I was shooting at.
[73:58.82]I'm sorry.
[73:59.22]Alright.
[74:00.89]See you guys on the other side of the level.
[74:02.73]Good luck.
[74:13.33]Reload the gun already.
[74:16.81]Bye.
[74:18.77]Why even shoot it?
[74:20.61]Why me?
[74:21.09]Why me?
[74:22.87]Why is he killing you?
[74:24.48]It picks two people to kill and then it leaves.
[74:27.68]What about this dog?
[74:32.14]Restart.
[74:32.98]Restart.
[74:33.64]Restart.
[74:34.10]Restart.
[74:35.26]Restart.
[74:37.18]You can do it.
[74:38.36]You got this.
[74:39.10]Just be brave.
[74:40.18]You've been training for this.
[74:42.73]Where do we need to rescue them?
[74:44.19]We haven't spawned yet, I don't think.
[74:49.49]If you wait here, I think it's more likely we spawn closer to you.
[74:53.07]I see Criken over there.
[74:54.73]Hey, Criken, how you doing, huh?
[75:02.56]Hey, how you doing?
[75:04.78]Should we just all talk in Kermit-esque voices?
[75:07.88]But don't overdo it, though.
[75:10.00]Make people believe this is what you sound like.
[75:11.99]like if people just join in they don't know already and they're like wait yeah yeah I mean that a little don't go too far though just a little what does don't go too far mean that it wasn't uh like doing this is a little too far but I'm just talking like just a little bit alright just okay just a little just a little bit hey what if uh oh that's a great title for uh for a video right yeah the frogs play dark side hold on let me just make sure I get through this oh
[75:40.58]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[75:45.62]Oh, oh, hold on.
[75:49.51]Hold on.
[75:50.43]Restart.
[75:53.06]This actually gives me a restart.
[75:55.87]It's not a restart if you clutch it.
[75:57.15]Vinny, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to get you.
[75:59.29]Clutch, smush, clutch.
[76:02.39]Okay.
[76:03.53]Alright.
[76:03.91]Give me it.
[76:07.62]He's going to use all the healing.
[76:14.50]Just give me all the loot.
[76:15.38]I don't care.
[76:15.80]Clutch or kick.
[76:17.24]Give me it.
[76:23.16]I'm coming.
[76:23.42]Excuse me.
[76:23.68]Excuse you.
[76:24.04]I need that.
[76:24.36]I don't know.
[76:26.78]I thought that was an entrance.
[76:28.35]I hate this Kermit bit.
[76:29.07]Please stop.
[76:29.37]One person said that.
[76:51.24]We had to restart.
[76:52.28]Look, we got spawned on by the big demon thing in the very, very beginning.
[76:56.17]Let's restart.
[76:56.95]Yeah, we did get spawned on by the big demon thing.
[76:58.67]That wasn't our fault.
[76:59.67]That was not our fault.
[77:00.53]Just restart.
[77:01.45]Yeah, it definitely wasn't me that activated that.
[77:08.52]So, for sure.
[77:10.40]Oh, good.
[77:11.88]Because I was about to blame you.
[77:12.72]That was close.
[77:17.54]That is delicious.
[77:19.99]What?
[77:20.38]What is it?
[77:21.50]Green tea.
[77:25.92]A rarity.
[77:27.99]It is a green tea energy formula.
[77:32.21]Not like a real coffee?
[77:35.29]I like green tea Kit Kats.
[77:36.89]Have you ever had those?
[77:39.01]No.
[77:39.79]They sound pretty good though.
[77:41.57]Awesome.
[77:46.42]What makes it green?
[77:48.06]There is matcha powder in it.
[77:50.97]So that's what makes it green.
[77:52.63]Alright.
[77:54.63]Requeue.
[77:55.23]Redo.
[77:55.55]I actually don't think I want to use this weapon.
[78:01.51]It's just unfortunate because it was $8,000.
[78:04.53]Yeah.
[78:04.95]I kind of also made a mistake.
[78:06.47]I got the Hellbore laser and I'm not sure I'm loving it.
[78:09.63]I did that to you.
[78:12.47]I'm trying to use other stuff, but I do think the shop reset.
[78:16.61]Did it reset?
[78:19.19]Yeah.
[78:22.47]I'll try it again now.
[78:25.39]Where can I?
[78:26.93]Did it reset?
[78:34.58]I thought so.
[78:35.26]I didn't recognize that at all.
[78:38.80]Mine is not reset.
[78:45.12]Ster, you just lied to, I mean, probably two or three hundred thousand people watching right now.
[78:51.49]I think that they will enjoy the engagement created by their anger towards me.
[78:59.93]Okay.
[79:02.60]They will enjoy the anger?
[79:04.40]They won't know that they're enjoying it and they won't know that they're more engaged, but they are.
[79:08.60]Where is the upgrader?
[79:10.54]It's over here, right?
[79:11.78]Let's see if I can upgrade this.
[79:15.93]Can I afford to do this?
[79:24.17]Oh, no.
[79:28.51]How many do I need?
[79:29.13]150?
[79:33.66]Shit.
[79:35.42]Yeah, the upgrading's a little complicated right now.
[79:37.42]It seems like you can incentivize to wait until you hit max level.
[79:41.56]Okay.
[79:42.58]But at least to get, like, purples.
[79:45.34]Yeah, the purples are what I'm looking for.
[79:49.50]I'll use what I was using before.
[79:50.48]I think I like it.
[79:56.69]Alright, ready to just re-queue?
[79:57.73]Try that again.
[79:58.73]Yeah.
[79:59.13]Want to do the same one or do something different?
[80:01.79]Um... What's that something like... Oh, sorry.
[80:04.32]No, whatever.
[80:04.88]Whatever you guys want to do.
[80:08.30]Uh... Is there something like Navigators from Dune in the Warhammer universe?
[80:15.48]Hmm.
[80:17.70]Uh... I don't know.
[80:18.68]What is that?
[80:20.78]I don't know.
[80:21.76]Maybe travel answer.
[80:22.76]They're juiced up with spice so that they can see the future as they light travel through space.
[80:29.09]Yeah.
[80:29.45]They're like practically another species from how much spice they've been juicing up on in a canister.
[80:33.97]They're like weird fish creatures because they evolved because they took too much spice.
[80:39.19]Instead of using computers to navigate FTL drives, they just use these weird spiced up fish creatures.
[80:46.34]Apparently that exists in Warhammer.
[80:47.50]They're just called navigators and they
[80:50.20]they help navigate through space because space is chaos and they're like on the brink of insanity at all times but are used as basically a tool so we so we are of all the different factions and everything right so this game wait hold on this game copied dune and starcraft I don't know when these these things were written
[81:14.31]It's out of the timeline.
[81:15.17]You're engaged.
[81:16.29]You're engaged.
[81:16.91]Well, hold on a minute.
[81:18.25]Hold on just a minute.
[81:18.99]You're engaged, but it's like through the roof right now.
[81:20.67]Hold on just a minute.
[81:22.95]Warhammer was first, motherfuckers.
[81:27.75]Wait, wait, what?
[81:28.71]Warhammer was first.
[81:30.21]It was the first of all these things.
[81:33.43]Actually... Well, I don't want to lose you ad money, so I won't say anything.
[81:42.08]Actually, Warhammer...
[81:44.96]Excuse me.
[81:46.18]The only book you need to be reading because it came first is the Bible.
[81:51.26]Everything copied the Bible.
[81:52.66]Okay.
[81:56.32]That's not a false statement.
[81:57.72]Do you want to do another three?
[81:58.88]Do you want to do a two?
[81:59.98]What's the vibe?
[82:02.33]Jerma's choice?
[82:03.61]We'll do three.
[82:04.59]We can do three.
[82:05.17]We got to lock in.
[82:06.01]We got to get in the middle.
[82:06.59]Alright.
[82:08.57]Let's do this one.
[82:12.40]Alright, guys, lock in.
[82:13.28]Let's get in the middle.
[82:13.96]Alright, let's get in the middle.
[82:15.58]Okay.
[82:15.70]I'm going to be really careful about, like, those witch things, whatever they are.
[82:20.00]What does get in the middle mean to you, Jermaine?
[82:22.26]What does that mean?
[82:23.86]It's like a three.
[82:26.11]Let's get in the middle?
[82:27.31]It's a three out of five.
[82:29.39]Oh.
[82:30.09]I don't want to do a two.
[82:31.43]I don't want to do a four.
[82:32.19]Let's do right in the middle.
[82:32.99]Three.
[82:33.89]Two and a half.
[82:35.45]Alright.
[82:37.90]I think I just canceled.
[82:39.56]No, I didn't.
[82:47.87]Jerma is about to... I don't know what that means.
[82:49.93]Where'd my hair go?
[82:50.65]Look at my hat.
[82:53.99]Yeah, your hair is gone.
[82:55.83]Who shaved my head?
[82:56.65]It's like the first person to fall asleep at a slumber party, dude.
[83:02.53]Oh, yeah, your hair is gone completely.
[83:05.36]Quick, check and see if you have any new tattoos.
[83:08.44]Alright.
[83:08.70]It's gone.
[83:09.52]I'm actually peeved.
[83:11.02]What?
[83:11.66]It is gone.
[83:12.90]Wait, let me see in game.
[83:13.92]Let me see.
[83:15.30]It's still gone.
[83:17.68]It is actually gone.
[83:19.22]That was my whole character.
[83:20.52]Your whole character arc.
[83:22.06]You got to finish a run.
[83:23.70]Can't die to a demon.
[83:24.64]Alright.
[83:25.10]Let's go.
[83:27.20]I don't want to hear about other franchises.
[83:29.78]I don't want to hear about all the other favorite movies that you have or other books that you've read in the last few years.
[83:36.34]All I care about.
[83:39.37]I don't want to hear about the Bible.
[83:41.69]I want us to rock this right in the middle three star.
[83:45.94]Right down the center.
[83:53.34]Three out of six.
[83:54.34]I don't want to hear about the Bible.
[84:03.23]I did it.
[84:03.69]I did long bomb.
[84:05.55]I'm that guy.
[84:06.17]Oh, you got the achievement?
[84:07.69]Yeah.
[84:09.01]For the Hellbore laser, do you recommend charging it fully each time or is it okay to just kind of like wail on it?
[84:16.62]Charge it if it's not a normal enemy.
[84:20.46]You should go off the edge now.
[84:21.70]But if you headshot normal enemies, they should go down in one hit without a charge.
[84:25.20]How am I so dead already?
[84:26.64]Die.
[84:28.52]Die.
[84:31.70]I am dead.
[84:32.54]I am dead already.
[84:34.68]I am dead already.
[84:36.78]Your guy literally just said, I'm not dead yet.
[84:38.78]I am dead already.
[84:40.40]There's some narrative dissonance right now between Smush on comms and Smush in game.
[84:48.45]Alright.
[84:50.11]Here you go, buddy.
[84:51.77]That's right.
[84:52.45]They're big.
[84:53.51]Alright.
[84:55.45]Somebody said you need to dodge.
[84:56.23]Oh, that's tomorrow.
[85:01.27]Okay.
[85:02.05]That's the only explanation I'm going to give.
[85:05.71]Yeah, that's tomorrow.
[85:06.83]Alright.
[85:07.71]That's fine.
[85:08.51]Good luck.
[85:09.01]Don't die.
[85:09.43]Yeah, I'm going to be on, you know, Austin show.
[85:16.19]Yeah.
[85:17.19]I'm going to be on Austin show stream and we're going to be, you know, we're operating a plane, a plane like a plane.
[85:26.12]Honestly, it feels really weird that you're promoting something that isn't Warhammer right now.
[85:37.11]because I'm like knowing Jerma he's probably like learned and you know got his pilot's license put 10 000 hours in and is now actually flying a real plane oh god and he did this all in the last two months like that's that's where my mind went he's dog
[85:59.28]We're supposed to be focusing, and you guys are still talking about the Bible.
[86:02.30]And the plane, sorry.
[86:03.22]We're talking about the plane.
[86:05.16]Alright, I'm just glad you're not, like, putting yourself in danger for a bit.
[86:10.41]That's good.
[86:11.57]No, no, it's gonna be fun.
[86:13.75]Okay.
[86:14.55]It's gonna be a fun time.
[86:15.87]I'm actually pretty excited for it.
[86:17.05]It seems very, very interesting.
[86:27.34]This is something I probably should have asked a long, long time ago.
[86:31.80]Do headshots actually matter for most of weapons or no?
[86:37.18]Yes.
[86:37.84]So even like explosives?
[86:40.67]Uh, explosives?
[86:41.85]Like if you hit somebody right in the head.
[86:44.17]Anything that has a projectile or melee attack.
[86:48.67]It makes contacts.
[86:50.27]It is better.
[86:51.15]Yeah.
[86:52.34]So the Mauler has apparently more armor on the head.
[86:55.18]That means he's healing, veteran!
[86:59.70]Cool.
[87:00.88]Once again, I have forgotten to use my abilities.
[87:02.30]I think I hear another demon host down the hallway.
[87:04.00]Is that what that was?
[87:05.40]I was hearing the whispers too.
[87:06.58]Yeah, it might be.
[87:07.98]Alright, I don't want to waste ammo.
[87:22.53]Ooh, stuff in here.
[87:25.45]There we go.
[87:26.01]Vinny, you should take that.
[87:30.42]Thanks.
[87:30.86]Your aim doesn't sound very good, does it?
[87:33.20]You just self-reported.
[87:33.96]You self-reported that you can't get headshots.
[87:55.87]Until you get the, uh, the bolters there.
[87:58.15]That's gonna change your routine.
[88:16.36]It won't.
[88:17.21]Oh, shit.
[88:18.23]It won't.
[88:21.64]Uh-oh.
[88:22.60]Oh, frick me.
[88:23.96]What?
[88:25.18]That was entirely my bad.
[88:26.44]I was trying to get the sniper.
[88:27.54]I tunnel visioned, and now I'm going to die.
[88:29.62]Goodbye, everyone.
[88:30.74]Good luck with the demon host.
[88:32.33]Trying to kill the sniper first.
[88:34.23]Oh, good.
[88:35.41]Can we run away from the demon host?
[88:37.99]It's going to kill one other person, so just pick who it's going to be.
[88:45.23]I'll take full responsibility for that one.
[88:46.51]What was that?
[88:47.13]That, like, laugh.
[88:47.96]Did you hear that?
[88:48.98]That's going to be me.
[88:51.02]Oh!
[88:53.83]Just let it happen.
[88:54.61]That's fine.
[88:55.51]Oh Live just don't worry about me survive avoid demon host and live Ster What what's only you and me okay?
[89:05.96]Let's live oh?
[89:08.62]No
[89:17.86]They're chasing.
[89:19.18]They don't care about me.
[89:20.67]I am.
[89:21.03]Dude, I'm not a threat.
[89:22.63]They're going after you.
[89:23.57]They're running by me.
[89:24.65]Okay.
[89:26.97]You got this.
[89:27.29]You got this.
[89:27.59]You got this.
[89:28.73]Alright.
[89:28.97]Let's do it.
[89:37.21]He shot me.
[89:37.81]He shot me.
[89:38.21]He came down the stairs.
[89:38.89]Alright.
[89:39.57]He ran back up the stairs.
[89:42.57]Be careful.
[89:43.07]There are two.
[89:44.07]There's a lot of people down here.
[89:49.10]It's alright.
[89:49.48]Don't.
[89:50.07]Leave me.
[89:50.71]I'm dead.
[89:51.47]Leave me.
[89:51.75]Leave me.
[89:52.61]It's not worth it.
[89:56.77]Yeah, Ster, they were running by me to try to get you.
[89:59.75]And even if I was standing there trying to block.
[90:08.86]That sniper's still up here.
[90:12.24]I think he shot me.
[90:18.29]that armor.
[90:20.00]I'm getting blown up by this guy.
[90:23.56]Oh, no.
[90:24.06]It's just you, right?
[90:26.80]Well, the sniper!
[90:27.56]I died!
[90:28.42]The sniper got everyone.
[90:29.82]Wait, that was insane.
[90:30.92]Alright, let's not talk about this round.
[90:32.36]This round was an absolute failure.
[90:33.92]I will take responsibility.
[90:35.52]Let's move on, alright?
[90:36.56]Stay positive, guys.
[90:37.83]So the first chapter of the Bible goes over a few things, right?
[90:45.53]Yeah.
[90:45.69]Mm-hmm.
[90:46.50]There's the apple.
[90:47.46]There was the, uh, on the sixth, seventh day, God rested and stuff.
[90:53.70]There's a serpent, serpent, serpent.
[90:56.18]Huh?
[90:57.48]Catholic school, 16 years.
[90:58.60]I remember.
[91:01.42]Favorite apostle.
[91:02.06]What's your favorite tarot card?
[91:05.20]Page of swords.
[91:06.68]Favorite apostle is, um, Caelid.
[91:09.58]Hey, mine's the ace of spades.
[91:16.00]Uh,
[91:19.72]True.
[91:24.59]Yeah, if you had your hair, I think we could have done better.
[91:27.15]Yeah, I 100% blame the lack of hair.
[91:28.95]Also, if I didn't have that SMG, I think... It's back now.
[91:32.75]Oh, people hate this routine.
[91:35.39]What, the Bible?
[91:36.65]Us losing?
[91:37.18]I'm getting a lot of negative reaction to the joke that I just said.
[91:41.88]Oh, it's the spades.
[91:45.62]Yeah.
[91:46.56]It's not a good one.
[91:48.66]If you like to gamble, baby, I'm your man.
[91:52.07]Yeah, people didn't like it.
[91:54.21]The Ace of Spades song, Motorhead.
[91:55.71]That is cool, right?
[91:56.63]Tony Hawk.
[91:57.95]How do you do it?
[92:00.29]It's all the same to me.
[92:03.95]Yeah.
[92:07.79]Dude, Tony Hawk seriously had, I don't think a soundtrack had ever come close.
[92:10.79]Maybe one of the GTAs.
[92:13.99]Love Tony Hawk soundtrack.
[92:15.47]The remake had, well, we're talking about a different game now.
[92:19.72]You know what has a great soundtrack?
[92:20.73]Warhammer 40k Darktide.
[92:22.43]It does.
[92:24.67]Just for kid.
[92:25.93]Killing it.
[92:27.51]Yeah, the GTA, I mean, you can pull out a playlist if you want, but I remember listening to like GTA San Andreas, GTA 3, the radio was just, they had so much shit there, it was awesome.
[92:38.64]It's great.
[92:39.18]All of it will get you nice in content claim these days.
[92:41.62]Yep.
[92:47.33]What game OSTs do you guys listen to outside of the game, you know, when you're, like, walking to school?
[92:53.55]Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Skies of Arcadia.
[92:58.31]Wrong.
[92:58.67]Jesper Kidd, Darktide, and Vermintide.
[93:01.53]Oh, yeah, that one too.
[93:03.31]Wait, when you were walking to school?
[93:05.77]Yeah, yeah.
[93:08.55]Like, like Ragnarok, a very, very, very long time ago.
[93:15.40]Crypt of the Necrodancer.
[93:16.98]Yeah, Necrodancer is great.
[93:20.39]Yeah, on my way to school, I usually bump that up.
[93:23.47]Got the beatbox on one shoulder.
[93:25.35]I'm like, hey, kids.
[93:27.05]I pop up my skateboard into my hand.
[93:29.41]I am making an executive decision.
[93:31.58]We are to no longer make jokes.
[93:34.60]We're not making any references.
[93:36.02]We're going to only talk about this game because we have to get through it because we look real bad right now.
[93:41.50]Yeah, if we don't beat a level, then Jerma doesn't get paid.
[93:43.94]Oh, shit.
[93:47.05]Alright, let's lock in.
[93:49.49]Big guy over here.
[93:50.53]Let's make this contract a little bit more interesting.
[94:00.59]Shield guy.
[94:02.83]Yeah, I like the gun that instantly deletes all elite enemies rather than the SMG that tickles people's toes.
[94:12.49]Skill issue.
[94:13.95]What gun is that?
[94:14.57]I need that one.
[94:16.42]uh I don't think you can get it until 15. like a blue plasma yeah hey hey oh that was a collateral man oh wait somebody is behind us oops
[94:45.26]Alright, there we go.
[94:46.76]Where are these guys coming from?
[94:49.66]I got a grim already.
[94:51.15]Things are looking up.
[95:00.91]See, alright, we made it past the first hundred yards of the level.
[95:04.67]Alright, big collection.
[95:06.05]Uh-oh, I've been electric netted.
[95:10.97]The tech term is trapped.
[95:16.20]That too.
[95:19.70]A lot of people coming from over here.
[95:21.34]Big, big, big, big, big problem.
[95:22.76]Big problem.
[95:23.38]Huge problem.
[95:24.24]Throwing a grenade.
[95:36.67]Throwing a grenade.
[95:39.94]Dog.
[95:40.64]Dog's dead.
[95:43.10]The grenades you guys have.
[95:44.04]Holy shit.
[95:45.04]I have all the grenade specs.
[95:46.49]I just toss.
[95:47.69]Oh, toxic.
[95:49.89]I have the one that you have a chance to gain grenades when you kill things if you're near me, too.
[95:54.37]Like everyone.
[95:55.75]Got to get this toxic guy.
[96:02.18]Damn.
[96:03.54]I already need.
[96:03.98]Alright.
[96:04.40]That was a little smoother.
[96:06.32]That was great, guys.
[96:07.10]That was healing over here already.
[96:09.40]You go fix yourselves right up.
[96:14.04]How many slots?
[96:17.62]Enough for everyone to heal?
[96:19.28]Yeah, all three of you guys.
[96:22.94]Nice.
[96:23.34]Very good.
[96:23.64]Very good.
[96:25.44]Wow, that was great.
[96:26.28]That was great.
[96:28.58]Well done.
[96:29.59]Alright, guys, looks like we're going to have some special enemies up ahead.
[96:32.72]We already did that joke.
[96:34.14]Yeah, we did that.
[96:34.74]That was the other day.
[96:35.62]We're only allowed to talk about the game and no repeats.
[96:38.40]Yeah, no repeats.
[96:39.34]I'm learning the rules.
[96:40.34]Holy shit, that guy went all the way over there.
[96:47.62]Wait, look, there's no one here and then there's a big old horde.
[96:51.20]That's something, right?
[96:51.86]That's original.
[96:54.77]They were just like playing a game of dice.
[96:56.47]I have no idea how you almost completed a five.
[97:18.97]Honestly, it was the best game of Darktide I ever played and one of my top gamer moments of all time.
[97:25.68]Really?
[97:25.98]I kind of want to save the bot because it was like so fucking clutch.
[97:30.39]Shoot her.
[97:30.81]Shoot her over here somewhere.
[97:31.69]Watch out for the shooter.
[97:45.77]Alright, nice.
[97:46.33]We're okay.
[97:46.91]We're doing alright.
[97:47.47]We're doing alright.
[97:51.17]What?
[97:53.00]I keep seeing the red.
[97:53.88]That's a lot of people.
[98:02.94]Oh, yeah, I was also stoned for it.
[98:04.18]Oh, well, then that explains it.
[98:07.90]I got high for the level 5 mission, and I, like, entered a zone that I've never been in before.
[98:13.87]Yeah, I literally, like, saw between the codes.
[98:16.87]You saw the ancestor spirits.
[98:23.44]Oh, I...
[98:25.35]Think about it though, Criken.
[98:26.45]In the 60s, Jimi Hendrix was doing like crazy stuff on the guitar, but us, we're doing five star Darktide.
[98:32.28]You're right.
[98:32.84]This is my Jimi Hendrix moment.
[98:34.79]Yeah, that was your Jimi Hendrix moment.
[98:36.83]Speaking of Darktide, the game is available right now on Steam.
[98:39.55]It is launch day.
[98:45.06]I don't know why this is so goddamn funny.
[98:48.40]The game is out right now.
[98:50.51]It is on Steam.
[98:51.51]Launch day.
[98:52.37]Four-player co-op in the Warhammer 40k universe.
[98:54.71]Actually, very fun game.
[98:56.23]Yeah, get your Jimi Hendrix moment now on Steam and join the team.
[99:03.27]Wait, did anybody need this?
[99:06.65]The Grignards?
[99:07.33]No.
[99:09.29]Somebody's throwing?
[99:10.65]Yeah, I threw one and I picked it up.
[99:14.90]Does it repeat from a previous stream count for like a Joker reference?
[99:23.34]Yeah.
[99:23.50]Yeah, that's fine.
[99:25.84]That's fine?
[99:26.46]Okay.
[99:28.26]When I have my knife out and I tap block, I can make it wiggle like a pencil, you know, like in middle school.
[99:33.44]That's right.
[99:34.02]I didn't mention that before.
[99:36.08]Sniper.
[99:36.80]Sniper.
[99:37.54]Shooter.
[99:37.94]Sniper.
[99:38.40]Shooter.
[99:38.76]Sniper.
[99:39.18]This killed us last time.
[99:40.10]Top right.
[99:41.30]I got it.
[99:41.72]Don't worry.
[99:42.20]I'm on top of it already.
[99:45.11]That was not a sniper, by the way.
[99:50.76]Hound!
[99:53.54]Nice shot.
[99:57.36]Alright, move.
[100:04.77]Who has the best kind of like hacking tool or whatever?
[100:12.87]This game has some pretty satisfying melee, I will say that.
[100:19.73]That's a lot of guns.
[100:26.63]Oh boy.
[100:43.40]Whoa.
[100:44.48]That's a lot of guns.
[100:45.68]A good chunk of them.
[100:46.58]I'm down.
[100:52.14]Jimothy Hendrix.
[100:53.50]When Jimmy came undone.
[100:54.57]Oh, my God.
[100:56.45]When Jimmy came undone, I forgot about that.
[100:57.99]Oh, ow.
[100:58.93]What is this?
[101:01.11]There's two shotgunners shooting at me.
[101:02.91]Help.
[101:04.15]I need help.
[101:05.41]Yeah, we... Fuck!
[101:06.67]Oh, boy.
[101:08.45]Oh, no.
[101:09.13]Come on, I guess it's a beam.
[101:10.47]Oh, no.
[101:15.05]I was so locked in.
[101:16.91]Come on, you have to have your moment.
[101:20.48]I'm just going to wait until you guys respawn.
[101:26.28]I hope there's no trapper anymore.
[101:31.53]That was real anger.
[101:38.62]I'm nearby, at the very least.
[101:40.30]Yeah.
[101:40.50]Alright, I'm coming my way towards you.
[101:42.34]You just got a lot of dudes and some guns.
[101:44.27]I don't know if you see anything that can incapacitate me.
[101:48.41]Right behind you.
[101:51.27]Careful, careful.
[101:52.43]Oh, thank God.
[101:55.92]I mean, I could bite people right now.
[101:57.30]You know what I mean?
[101:57.96]Like, this is... I could bite people.
[102:01.10]Right.
[102:01.98]They're kneecaps.
[102:05.78]Fetish station.
[102:06.32]Fetish medic.
[102:08.06]Did he just drop a med kit?
[102:09.32]What was that?
[102:09.96]No, no, no.
[102:10.64]I had that on me and I died.
[102:13.76]Maybe you could have used it.
[102:19.01]Well, I... No, not really.
[102:21.89]Three people... Two people were down.
[102:23.17]I was trying to get you.
[102:24.15]No.
[102:24.21]What's the hack?
[102:25.67]Not me.
[102:26.03]Alright, I'll hack.
[102:32.08]I got you.
[102:32.80]I got my knife out.
[102:33.52]I'm ready to help you.
[102:34.56]Well, you know what?
[102:35.10]Here, let me hack.
[102:35.72]I'm probably the worst at this.
[102:37.00]What?
[102:37.28]Oh, this person's dead.
[102:46.28]Hacked.
[102:47.99]Nice job.
[103:02.09]Where?
[103:02.83]We're good?
[103:05.18]Nice shot.
[103:05.98]Who did that?
[103:06.60]Good job.
[103:07.24]That was awesome.
[103:08.30]Wow.
[103:09.14]That was actually... Is that a revolver you're using?
[103:10.68]Yeah.
[103:11.88]It's a revolver.
[103:12.56]Oh, it's going again.
[103:13.88]Try to get it.
[103:32.65]You should let me do it.
[103:35.47]I'm not super good at dealing with hordes.
[103:37.47]Okay.
[103:38.55]I got it.
[103:40.66]Oh, God.
[103:41.02]I hear screaming.
[103:41.72]Oh, my God.
[103:42.40]I got pinned by an arm.
[103:43.54]Hey, guys.
[103:43.86]What's that?
[103:46.96]God damn.
[103:47.54]He got me.
[103:48.06]We're good?
[103:49.46]Yeah, you're good.
[103:51.28]Hacking again.
[103:52.02]Alright.
[103:57.28]We're in.
[104:05.85]Shoot her.
[104:06.95]Oh, that's you.
[104:18.26]Oh.
[104:19.48]Where?
[104:20.90]How did I hit the railing?
[104:22.00]You've got to be shitting me.
[104:23.04]Reload!
[104:24.02]You got him?
[104:25.60]Nice.
[104:25.98]Alright.
[104:31.00]We're doing it, gang.
[104:31.78]A little bit of ammo down here if anyone needs it.
[104:39.71]Uh-oh.
[104:40.47]He's a knife-wielding maniac.
[104:41.57]How do you know I'm not going to do that later in my life, dude?
[104:43.81]I'm like 28.
[104:44.21]I got plenty of time.
[104:45.29]Dude, calm down.
[104:46.19]What?
[104:46.45]I'm gaming.
[104:51.13]What?
[104:51.43]What the hell was that?
[104:53.87]How did you get away?
[104:56.53]Get on screen now.
[104:57.47]That was... Don't say that.
[105:03.45]Alright.
[105:04.27]With the new Divergent AI, it learns and adapts to you.
[105:08.04]The dogs levitate.
[105:11.50]That was sick.
[105:15.28]That was a level three dog right down the middle.
[105:20.08]You don't get those in tier one maps.
[105:22.18]No.
[105:24.57]Can I do, I have a question.
[105:26.29]Right now, just give me your actual honest, like say it on a scale of one to 10.
[105:30.47]What's your fun factor right this very second right now?
[105:32.78]Like a two.
[105:34.50]Nine.
[105:34.92]Wow.
[105:35.22]Okay.
[105:35.80]Yep.
[105:37.12]I'll give it a nine.
[105:38.80]I'll give it a nine.
[105:40.00]I would say I'm pretty much at that about 9.0 right now.
[105:43.48]And just how I'm fun, I'm having right this very second with my friends and a phone call.
[105:47.90]That's nice, Jerma.
[105:49.31]Playing Darktide.
[105:49.77]That's really sweet.
[105:51.99]I think I honestly hit a 10 during the five mission we did.
[105:57.15]Yeah, but there's another reason why you hit that.
[105:59.03]What the fuck?
[105:59.91]Where did this guy come from?
[106:00.85]Jimi Hendrix won me.
[106:02.88]He's dead.
[106:03.24]There's a dude with a chain gun down there.
[106:12.37]I thought one of you were down there.
[106:16.48]It's held down there.
[106:17.30]Be careful.
[106:30.46]Somebody said, why are you not rating this a 10 with your friends?
[106:35.19]Because I don't ride this very moment.
[106:36.55]I don't have a nice, fresh, ice-cold beer.
[106:42.08]What sponsorship are you going to get next?
[106:45.40]Delicious cores.
[106:48.49]You need some place to go.
[106:49.87]If you go to a 10 right away, you can't hit that next level.
[106:54.61]Nothing is a 10.
[106:56.35]Yeah, you got to save 10 for transcendental moments.
[106:59.62]You don't even have all your perks yet and your weapons yet.
[107:02.10]You're going to have more fun later.
[107:05.16]You're investing in your future.
[107:08.28]There should be a healing thing over here.
[107:17.01]No, it actually is fun though.
[107:28.70]Like no joking around.
[107:29.88]No fucking around.
[107:31.92]It's very fun.
[107:32.48]No, I keep doing that.
[107:36.62]No, I'm bad.
[107:37.68]No, I'm bad.
[107:39.17]Why?
[107:39.41]This guy just wants to kill you star so bad.
[107:44.32]I'm jamming my knife in this guy's back.
[107:46.22]He does not care.
[107:47.20]He just wants you to die.
[107:49.95]I want that Medicaid.
[107:51.99]Medicaid.
[107:53.43]Hey, Peter.
[107:54.31]Check out this Medicaid over here.
[107:55.83]Oh, you do a pretty good job.
[107:57.76]Well done.
[107:59.02]You too, buddy.
[108:00.54]I knew we were friends for a reason, Cricket.
[108:02.94]Yeah.
[108:03.91]We do, Joe.
[108:04.63]We do, Kermit.
[108:05.99]We can do just about everything.
[108:08.45]Where the hell is the Medicaid?
[108:09.51]Are you leading it a little weird now?
[108:11.39]The amount of voices you can do?
[108:13.75]I feel like I really got some competition, you know what I mean?
[108:19.51]I am alone over here.
[108:20.47]I'm alone over here.
[108:21.73]I'm alone over here.
[108:22.37]And there's a lot of people.
[108:24.63]But you're not alone.
[108:25.43]I'm not alone.
[108:27.23]You have friends in the voice calls.
[108:28.77]God, that dog woof is so scary.
[108:32.15]Help, help, help, help, help, help, help.
[108:34.53]Okay, I'm going out to get him.
[108:38.23]I'm pinned.
[108:41.17]He's wrapping around the other side.
[108:45.15]He's going... Ster and Vinny, the dog's near you.
[108:50.83]Thanks.
[108:55.20]They just won't stop.
[108:56.76]Alright, we got to move.
[108:59.98]There's some kind of enemy with a gun.
[109:02.24]Alright.
[109:03.44]Give me.
[109:03.98]Don't you think it's quicker just to say shooter?
[109:10.39]There's an enemy up ahead with a weapon in his hand.
[109:17.67]I wanted to let my team know in the most descriptive way possible.
[109:21.99]It's true.
[109:28.85]What?
[109:29.09]I heard vomit.
[109:30.30]You're going to want to see this.
[109:32.48]Was it vomit?
[109:34.84]Was it vomit?
[109:35.56]Where is he?
[109:37.20]North.
[109:39.02]Oh, God.
[109:39.64]What did you say last stream?
[109:44.54]Unironically, it was like that just happened.
[109:48.44]Yeah, I did do that.
[109:50.16]So that just happened.
[109:53.51]Oh, alright.
[109:54.25]He just came to this tail behind you.
[109:55.39]Prisoner, prisoner, prisoner.
[109:59.29]It's me every time.
[110:00.77]Oh my god, he's the worst.
[110:02.43]It's me every time.
[110:03.47]Guys, Geister's throwing.
[110:07.50]I'm asserting.
[110:08.18]Yeah, well when you see the stats in the end game page, you're gonna know how much I really did.
[110:19.20]The add stats?
[110:20.46]No.
[110:25.18]Oh god, there's a big horde too that just appeared.
[110:27.04]What?
[110:30.92]Oh, that's bad.
[110:34.60]I threw like four of them.
[110:36.54]Oh.
[110:38.20]I'm down, lads.
[110:40.34]Oh, I don't know what to do.
[110:45.21]I don't know what to do.
[110:46.07]I don't know what to do.
[110:47.07]Ster, help.
[110:49.21]I'm dead.
[110:49.83]I'm dead.
[110:50.47]I'm dead.
[110:51.01]I'm dead.
[110:51.33]I can't get rid of it.
[110:52.25]I'm down.
[110:52.85]You're not dead.
[110:56.95]You're just down.
[110:57.87]Go!
[111:00.29]Oh, you got it!
[111:01.67]Oh my god.
[111:02.27]Saved the whole run.
[111:08.89]Nice!
[111:09.28]Alright, they should respawn.
[111:12.48]There's a healing thing here.
[111:13.48]Although, there's a grimoire, but I don't think we can do it.
[111:18.36]So let's just go.
[111:20.98]You got the med pack I dropped, right?
[111:22.94]Yeah, he's got it.
[111:24.24]That was crazy.
[111:24.92]That was intense.
[111:25.70]But trust more in the master of mankind!
[111:36.55]Criken, you are playing like the trailer of this game.
[111:46.23]This is unbelievable gameplay.
[111:50.43]I fell all the way down.
[111:53.79]I'm in a predicament down.
[111:54.87]Okay.
[111:56.11]I'm not down.
[111:56.67]I'm down.
[112:04.18]I feel like I'm watching somebody solo a five-star mission right now.
[112:15.18]All the dashes... Criken, what's this character's name?
[112:18.61]Oh, this is the Zealot, but I use the knife because the dash makes it go farther, so you get to, like, play it.
[112:22.51]Nice shot.
[112:25.09]Nice shot.
[112:25.89]Wow!
[112:26.61]Nice stat.
[112:29.15]Thanks.
[112:40.73]It just doesn't stop.
[112:44.17]Criken, I feel like you've been doing this in the same breath.
[112:52.15]I did not talk for ten minutes in the five run.
[112:54.49]I just became fucking silent.
[113:01.43]That was incredibly unfortunate.
[113:05.53]And then the horde showed up.
[113:06.57]We can still do this.
[113:13.37]Talk to Mr. Spad.
[113:14.01]Two of them?
[113:17.16]Oh my god.
[113:17.58]That's not fair.
[113:19.20]That's not fair.
[113:26.69]How are you still alive?
[113:42.05]Dude, good job though.
[113:44.15]Holy shit.
[113:44.69]That was actually great.
[113:47.45]You gave it so much.
[113:49.84]Damn, dude.
[113:50.32]That was amazing.
[114:00.18]We were close.
[114:03.04]We almost had it.
[114:05.09]Sorry, man.
[114:05.59]I don't think you're getting paid for this.
[114:08.96]wanna no we got the next one if we do a two then you can probably get his money no we're gonna they said it had to be at least a three no we're doing three I want to do a three we have to do a three we did we did a three on we just did one and we did it fine we did yeah the first one we did was a three so what happened you guys got comfortable cocky I I yeah we started talking too much sorry no more jokes you're right yeah nothing about the bible
[114:33.99]Yeah, what's tabooed, by the way, for the next run, just so we know, going into it?
[114:37.49]Probably doing any kind of funny voices as well.
[114:40.43]Alright, get out of the way now.
[114:43.00]I'll see you on the other side, Peter.
[114:45.60]I mean, alright, Lois.
[114:47.44]I mean, Joe.
[114:50.70]My Peter voice is just such a mess every time I do it.
[114:53.40]I think I have to be drunk.
[114:54.26]It's the only way I can get it out.
[114:59.58]I don't think mine is particularly good, but I try anyway.
[115:03.76]I think no matter what, everybody just hates it.
[115:05.96]Guys, can you give me one sec?
[115:07.70]I just want to buy a new weapon because I don't know if I love this one.
[115:10.34]I don't think it's reset the store yet because we've lost three times within one reset, but it will by the next time.
[115:16.32]Alright, we got to go for it.
[115:17.96]Everybody lock in.
[115:18.74]We need rolls secure.
[115:21.12]Everybody lock in.
[115:23.04]Roll secure.
[115:25.31]I'm going to spend, you know what?
[115:26.51]I'm spending a little bit more time focusing on tanking and pushing, dodging.
[115:33.99]This is the one right here, and we're going to pull it back.
[115:36.57]That sounds great, dude.
[115:39.25]Alright.
[115:39.77]Let's go.
[115:41.49]We had a couple of bad ones, but I'll be very honest with you.
[115:45.95]That's hard.
[115:47.58]That was hard.
[115:50.30]We got spawned on a couple times.
[115:51.62]It was like three or four, you know, what do you want to call them?
[115:56.70]Special or monsters?
[115:58.46]Special with guns.
[115:59.34]Special enemies.
[116:00.96]Special enemies.
[116:02.85]We got spawned on a couple times.
[116:07.01]Can we get a breakdown from Smush at the end of every level on how it went?
[116:11.07]So we can do an improvement and everything?
[116:12.51]Yeah.
[116:14.03]I could.
[116:17.37]Locker room speech.
[116:19.33]Yeah.
[116:20.19]Yeah, actually, before we start the level, how about you give us locker room speech?
[116:25.51]Jerma, you're so cringe.
[116:31.05]What, because I have pep talking friends to try to do a harder difficulty mission?
[116:37.62]Dude, there was like 15 comments that were like, can you do my son's like birthday?
[116:41.84]He's turning 12 and you picked that one to read.
[116:46.19]Is it just a thing now?
[116:47.05]Everyone goes through a stream for you to wish them a happy birthday?
[116:50.25]Well, it is now because you both just said it.
[116:53.29]I tuned in to strip and stream earlier today and that also happened.
[116:55.92]You also shouted out a birthday.
[116:58.72]Wait, what?
[117:00.08]You know, he's never wished me a happy birthday like once.
[117:03.56]It was yesterday.
[117:04.08]And you guys were playing Wilderman.
[117:06.46]Yes, I did.
[117:08.79]I know we're not supposed to talk about other games.
[117:11.05]I'm just curious.
[117:11.61]Is that game good?
[117:14.03]Yeah.
[117:18.35]This is so much fun.
[117:19.33]I'm having a blast.
[117:20.09]This is great.
[117:23.49]Why did you just ignore Vinny?
[117:27.33]I did I didn't mean to do that.
[117:29.53]Yes.
[117:30.79]Yes that it actually was a pretty funny.
[117:32.41]It's cool game.
[117:33.05]Okay, cool.
[117:33.67]Thanks I'm having a blast.
[117:35.50]I'm sorry.
[117:36.72]I did so much fun.
[117:37.64]I'm just having a blast guys Hey, thanks for the The locker room speech by the way, alright honest to goodness Let's play
[117:51.66]Let there be gaming.
[117:53.66]Let there be gaming.
[117:55.10]I'm imagining Ted Lasso, but it's just Jerma, and he just gets into the locker room.
[117:58.98]Alright, guys.
[118:00.10]Honest to goodness, let's play.
[118:01.64]We've got our enemies on the right side.
[118:03.99]Big smile on his face, pats him on the shoulder, leaves the room.
[118:08.67]Honest to goodness, let's play.
[118:14.85]Alright.
[118:32.28]I was going to say, now it got eerily quiet.
[118:35.78]I don't want to say the wrong thing.
[118:38.42]Anything will trigger this, guys.
[118:43.62]Does he also send you guys review scores after you're on a stream with him?
[118:47.16]Yeah.
[118:47.54]I mean...
[118:50.56]It's been a while, but, like, after Wildermyth, it was like, here's, like, the breakdown of, like, like, different rating, like, commentary.
[118:57.92]Like, the timestamps, right?
[118:58.70]Like, this comment was out of line.
[119:00.80]Well, it's the timestamps, and it's the overall, like, your emotional level, your commentary, your attitude, like, one by one.
[119:08.24]Well, I know.
[119:08.82]I download all of your VODs, and I write over it in red pen.
[119:14.71]And I circle, like, oh, over here, you see, you missed this part, and your face came glitched out at this point, too.
[119:21.64]That was you.
[119:22.20]Wait, don't watch mine then.
[119:23.16]I don't have a face cam on right now.
[119:29.06]Okay, cool.
[119:33.73]Alright.
[119:35.19]Watch this.
[119:36.09]Boys!
[119:36.79]Boys!
[119:38.13]Sniper.
[119:38.33]Hold on, I can get him.
[119:39.43]Wait, where the fuck is he?
[119:43.96]Yeah, he's like, he runs up to the corner, takes your shot, and then just like walks away.
[119:58.89]I'm assuming gun melee even with a bayonet isn't as good as regular melee right I believe so no you can still headshot with them and it'll kill most guys in one hit but that gun with usually the bayonet guns have such a long time to switch that if it's just one guy it's worth it okay
[120:27.88]I can't believe it's 78 I'm gonna die I almost just puked yeah like in real life what the heck is happening to my character heresy he's with nurgle this guy puked streamer pukes live on stream
[120:51.40]I'm good, I'm good.
[120:52.12]We were doing the World of Warcraft dungeon with my friend a few years ago and we were doing permadeath challenge and he was healing and he got so nervous that he literally took a break, went to the bathroom and puked because he didn't want to die and be his fault.
[121:05.76]It was that high pressure of a situation?
[121:07.84]Yes.
[121:08.12]Wow.
[121:11.20]The nerves building up there, that's... Damn.
[121:13.14]Yeah, I think you're going backwards.
[121:27.93]Alright, we're doing alright.
[121:28.99]Things are going okay.
[121:37.82]Dog.
[121:39.02]Where?
[121:39.56]I don't know.
[121:39.98]Somewhere.
[121:40.32]Right there.
[121:41.56]Good shout out.
[121:45.27]Good call.
[121:45.71]Good reaction time.
[121:59.54]Wait, only way is down.
[122:01.12]We go down?
[122:01.90]Oh, here.
[122:03.56]Watch out behind you.
[122:04.34]Go down.
[122:10.94]Enemies with pus on them.
[122:12.00]I don't know what they're called.
[122:20.23]Pox walkers.
[122:21.95]Thank you.
[122:29.38]Nice shot.
[122:37.91]If you touch fire, it removes all of your shield instantly.
[122:40.31]Yeah.
[122:40.73]Does it really?
[122:41.29]Yeah.
[122:42.51]It's like an instant, like, boom, the fire punched you in the face.
[122:48.73]I've got a battery.
[122:49.49]This is too many.
[122:52.41]What the heck?
[122:54.08]A lot.
[122:56.78]We got a battery.
[122:57.36]Oh, good.
[122:57.74]We can use that to get a health station, you're right.
[123:01.13]Wait, there's a health station?
[123:03.07]Should be.
[123:03.37]A net?
[123:03.97]Electric net?
[123:06.61]Where's the... Should we just bring his... I can carry this the best, right?
[123:09.12]Let me look.
[123:10.32]Should be very close.
[123:12.10]Yeah, there are drops enabled if you have drops on.
[123:14.26]Yep.
[123:15.64]I think it's cosmetic and camos and stuff.
[123:20.55]Yeah, from the other night when we streamed together, Jerma, I got the drops.
[123:25.71]Oh, nice.
[123:26.81]It's like a sword skin that I'm using right now.
[123:29.95]I dropped the thing.
[123:31.79]It's over here.
[123:32.33]This is the mid thing.
[123:36.59]You're alone back there.
[123:38.45]That dog took like... You saw how many hits that took, right?
[123:41.81]Yeah.
[123:42.17]I did like a full charge shot on it.
[123:44.40]Yeah.
[123:44.60]Alright.
[123:46.08]We got healing.
[123:46.58]Alright.
[123:47.24]Everyone can use it.
[123:50.74]Oh, that's such good healing.
[123:53.28]What the?
[123:53.78]Oh, come on.
[123:54.46]I was looking over at the chat room for one second.
[123:56.86]The perfect timed grenade.
[123:58.28]They were watching the stream.
[124:07.68]Any secrets in here?
[124:12.81]Grenade.
[124:13.19]Looks like a Grim, I guess.
[124:23.61]I'm not going to drop down yet.
[124:25.35]Big guy.
[124:26.03]Good.
[124:26.25]Here we go.
[124:30.27]He has a machine gun, doesn't he?
[124:54.78]You did.
[124:55.50]The master made me claim it.
[124:59.16]Yo, hey, hey, friend.
[125:00.76]Hey, friend.
[125:05.67]Hey, friend.
[125:12.45]Yeah, get in there.
[125:26.71]Uh-oh.
[125:27.89]Watch that back area.
[125:30.91]Watching the back area.
[125:31.81]Yeah, there's a lot of gunners over there.
[125:33.07]Just be careful.
[125:38.61]Come on.
[125:43.48]Man, what a grimoire.
[125:47.94]If I were a grimoire... We got shooters.
[125:51.36]They all dead?
[125:51.82]We got shooters.
[125:52.50]I think we're good.
[125:56.65]This is the furthest we've been.
[125:58.85]Yeah, this is the furthest we've been in like three missions.
[126:05.00]You were pretty quiet last mission.
[126:07.98]Dog.
[126:12.78]You were going to say if I was a grimoire, where would I hide, right?
[126:15.51]Yeah.
[126:16.79]Where's this dog?
[126:17.49]Fuck!
[126:19.93]I'd go in a library.
[126:22.33]Yeah.
[126:23.25]A skull library.
[126:25.43]Any items to pick up?
[126:27.57]Because we have that button to press, right?
[126:29.53]Yeah, not that I've seen.
[126:30.93]I guess we just press it, probably.
[126:33.53]I've not done this level.
[126:34.25]Let's see.
[126:38.64]Oh, man.
[126:40.24]Where did you... Something's shaking.
[126:41.44]Where did that guy even come... Oh, there they are.
[126:45.58]Whoa.
[126:48.75]Big guy on the left.
[126:49.27]Charger on the left.
[126:49.83]Charger guy.
[126:50.49]Charger guy.
[126:50.83]Got me.
[127:08.70]Alright, you look I don't know you look just like that guy you would like the same costume on What What I'm not an enemy.
[127:19.62]I'm just wearing all the way down there.
[127:21.98]I don't know.
[127:22.32]I'm just killing enemies.
[127:23.34]What are you guys doing?
[127:25.39]Watching you kill names.
[127:26.37]I mean are we supposed to drop down?
[127:28.57]The servers have a colony
[127:35.07]Really?
[127:35.89]Oh god, there's a charging awkward.
[127:37.53]Yeah.
[127:38.67]That runs fast.
[127:39.45]That's terrifying.
[127:39.93]He's up there.
[127:41.99]He's just running down the stairs.
[127:45.48]And when I'm late to work.
[127:46.46]Oh god.
[127:48.40]I need help, please.
[127:49.54]Also, I got ammo for later.
[127:51.68]I got ammo for later.
[127:52.66]I have no more bullets left.
[127:57.39]See when Jerma says, OXM, do you have a room for you?
[128:01.24]One of them's going to land.
[128:04.34]I just kept shooting Jerma.
[128:06.76]He's just so big.
[128:12.74]You need to check posture.
[128:13.66]You have a... Oh, shit.
[128:16.44]Am I doing a... Do I have... I am.
[128:18.96]Alright, I got to check that posture.
[128:20.60]Thank you.
[128:21.06]Appreciate it.
[128:22.62]Oh, the gamer slunch?
[128:24.04]Yeah, I was like... Slunch is a good word.
[128:27.58]Yeah.
[128:28.82]Slunch with an S in front of it.
[128:30.16]It's like a hunch, but also a slouch.
[128:32.92]I like that.
[128:33.54]Yeah.
[128:37.84]Slunch sounds freaking nasty, don't it?
[128:40.55]Yeah.
[128:41.53]Like, what'd you have in your slunch box this morning?
[128:44.35]Wasn't good.
[128:45.79]Nothing good.
[128:46.79]Well, I think I see a Grim.
[128:48.61]What's that nasty, nasty green glow?
[128:50.34]It's a Grim.
[128:52.48]Woohoo!
[128:55.34]There's like a servitor panel down here.
[128:57.18]Are we doing this?
[128:58.10]Hold on.
[128:59.06]They're jingling keys.
[129:13.57]Again, if we need ammo at any point, let me know.
[129:15.58]I have an ammo box.
[129:16.52]I can drop it.
[129:17.12]They're coming.
[129:29.63]Oh wow, that hurt.
[129:31.00]I think there's a sniper over there.
[129:35.02]Behind us, behind us, behind us.
[129:36.30]Oh boy.
[129:38.74]Some spicy hordes happening right now.
[129:41.10]Dog on me, dog on me.
[129:45.06]Get it off, get it off, get it off.
[129:49.79]Oh boy, this is going to be bad.
[129:51.89]They're coming in the door.
[129:53.51]Alright, we have a healing over here though, so let's get over here.
[130:04.53]New dog just dropped.
[130:06.31]Give me that!
[130:13.51]Give me it!
[130:16.76]Alright.
[130:20.56]I'm here!
[130:20.96]Do we need ammo?
[130:25.71]Let's all heal.
[130:27.37]I've also got an ammo crate.
[130:29.43]I'm going to put mine down.
[130:31.88]Ammo.
[130:32.28]What is that?
[130:34.10]You seriously.
[130:35.30]Oh, my God.
[130:35.82]Alright.
[130:36.66]Ammo's down next to me.
[130:42.60]Alright, these grenade placements are ridiculous.
[130:44.90]Come on.
[130:45.24]He probably built his whole ult from that.
[130:47.28]Wait, can we appreciate this, guys?
[130:49.45]This is a fucking servitor colony.
[130:53.09]Look at this thing.
[130:53.67]I'm gonna appreciate it in a second.
[130:55.27]Hang on.
[130:55.95]Yeah, make sure to grab the ammo if you didn't.
[130:57.81]Yeah, I got the ammo now.
[131:00.49]I have healing when needed, so... Yeah, let's save it.
[131:03.63]Save it for the middle of the fight, probably.
[131:05.73]Sure.
[131:06.95]Oh my god, look at this thing.
[131:09.33]Yeah, these are those half-dead, half-alive humanoid things that are used for technology.
[131:15.98]There's an entire fucking column of them.
[131:21.56]Rim dark.
[131:22.38]It's fun.
[131:24.84]That's creepy.
[131:27.20]How did I miss point blank?
[131:30.47]I'm scared of it.
[131:32.77]What's that noise?
[131:35.91]A sniper.
[131:36.31]I think.
[131:42.51]They're shooting from a random spot.
[131:43.97]Okay, we're good.
[131:45.27]Okay, I think we're good.
[131:47.49]Ready to start it?
[131:49.07]I believe we are okay.
[131:55.74]We should get it in this room or something.
[131:57.86]I feel like it's going to be a big hoarder wave, right?
[132:03.13]oh yeah we should get into the bottom room yeah bottom room bottom room well we're gonna have to run around and redo the yeah so we're gonna have to get up oh oh explosion watch out ah it hurt
[132:39.41]Sorry, I'm gonna restart that.
[132:43.95]You can do this, Smush.
[132:44.53]I believe in you.
[132:45.07]Come on!
[132:51.66]We put our Ogryn on it.
[132:53.32]I'm good.
[132:53.84]Yeah, we did.
[132:55.16]He's very smart for an Ogryn.
[132:57.46]I'm surprised we even let Ogryns do it.
[133:00.11]What's your blood type?
[133:01.16]Please help me.
[133:01.78]It's for a school project.
[133:03.10]What are you talking about?
[133:05.08]Do not read chat.
[133:06.00]This is not the time.
[133:09.20]Especially not that message.
[133:11.10]That's true.
[133:11.70]Why am I reading you?
[133:16.21]There.
[133:36.57]I'm on it.
[133:38.55]I've got this one.
[133:39.05]What time are you born?
[133:39.73]Around 6 a.m., I believe.
[133:40.57]I know that one off the top of my head.
[133:44.37]They're going to know you're rising.
[133:45.50]They're going to know your moon.
[133:46.30]Oh, fuck.
[133:46.62]You're right.
[133:47.00]They're going to know your stars.
[133:48.80]Oh, my rising.
[133:50.08]My star sign.
[133:52.24]Which, as you know, predicts your future.
[133:53.98]So, they'll be able to find you.
[134:00.06]Oh, behind us.
[134:00.68]The freaking astralizes you.
[134:02.08]Behind us.
[134:02.50]Behind us.
[134:02.84]Behind us.
[134:04.40]Behind...
[134:07.25]I killed myself.
[134:18.25]I killed myself.
[134:19.15]What?
[134:19.55]I killed myself.
[134:20.69]Where are you?
[134:21.83]Oh, I got you.
[134:24.13]My gun can blow up.
[134:26.33]Oh, your gun can blow up.
[134:29.15]I was worried about the sniper and I missed and then I missed.
[134:33.12]and it was a skill issue, and Jerma's right.
[134:35.38]I really need to go back to training.
[134:36.72]I need to go back to boot camp.
[134:39.07]That's totally going to be in your stream recap review, dude.
[134:42.07]Sorry to tell you.
[134:42.53]Hey, remember right here in the VOD where you missed these three shots?
[134:45.45]It cost us the round.
[134:46.55]Alright.
[134:53.70]Oh, they all turned blue.
[134:54.96]That means they're happy.
[134:57.34]Whoa.
[135:02.78]Ster, you can apparently switch weapons to avoid the self-damage.
[135:07.84]That's according to a chat message.
[135:10.26]Even after you've triggered it?
[135:11.50]We have to wait for the response.
[135:15.72]Wait for his response and whatever it is, ban him.
[135:21.18]Because I didn't ask.
[135:23.00]The answer is, I believe it's yes.
[135:29.38]Okay, well, let's find out.
[135:34.88]So where do we obtain this thing?
[135:36.82]Is it not ready yet?
[135:38.72]Nope.
[135:38.96]Can't switch weapons.
[135:41.30]Should I ban them?
[135:42.12]He just died?
[135:42.94]Yep.
[135:43.50]Definitely ban them.
[135:44.16]Actually throwing.
[135:45.50]Actually throwing.
[135:48.00]Jerma was throwing because he read chat and we all told him not to.
[135:52.23]I didn't... Oh shit, you actually are dead.
[135:55.69]You are dead for real.
[135:57.07]It's okay.
[135:57.41]We can proceed.
[135:59.01]We proceed.
[136:01.71]I'm almost dead myself, actually.
[136:14.61]That person that said that is probably holding their stomach laughing hysterically right now.
[136:19.51]Mm-hmm.
[136:21.46]on the verge of like tears they're slapping their knees like they're ham boning in place right now you know in the future like like cemeteries their gravestones are gonna have like clips of like the best moments of their life playing on it you can go visit that's gonna be on there that that'll be yeah yeah hey that's a great idea embedded Twitch clips on your gravestone yeah I'm starting a business that'll that'll happen someone will someone do that
[136:47.59]Yeah, all you hear is, ahhh.
[137:05.25]I want to rock and roll!
[137:07.43]Oh no!
[137:09.05]Your corpse retains senses and you're like just there, unable to move.
[137:14.01]Or even if you're like in heaven walking around, like that's still playing and only you can hear it.
[137:19.03]Wait, sir, I thought this elevator was going to go up, but we're going away from it now.
[137:22.92]Oh, shit.
[137:24.32]Sorry.
[137:24.94]Will he reappear somewhere else?
[137:27.24]Yeah, he should, but who knows how long that's going to take.
[137:30.60]I don't know what hand boning is.
[137:34.00]What's hand boning?
[137:35.79]When you, like, slap your knee.
[137:37.31]Yeah.
[137:37.93]You're like, like, like, like, uh.
[137:40.09]It's only one.
[137:40.91]Slapping your body.
[137:42.09]Um.
[137:42.33]Yeah, Vinny, you just take this.
[137:44.37]Thanks.
[137:47.41]Jesus!
[137:47.79]Remember, I still have a med kit if needed, so.
[137:52.01]Oh, look.
[137:53.18]It's the.
[137:54.42]They opened that door.
[137:55.30]That was kind of creepy.
[137:57.38]Yeah, I saw.
[137:58.28]When I walked in that room, the door just closed.
[138:00.14]And then I think, like, I walked out when you were there. 175.
[138:09.28]Oh, was there a follow-up to the ham boning?
[138:10.92]Or just... No, I just, like... Sneeze that.
[138:13.98]Because the way I said that is, like, the chat member who tricked you, he's ham boning in place because he's so, like, he's so happy.
[138:23.15]He's joking.
[138:23.83]Or is ham boning always in place?
[138:26.89]I guess you can walk around while you ham bone.
[138:28.57]It looks real silly, but that's part of the fun.
[138:30.60]Alright.
[138:32.62]My eyebrow is so itchy.
[138:36.45]Hey, King, take a minute.
[138:39.49]Take care of it.
[138:45.94]Alright, I'm gonna get prisoner.
[138:52.52]Help!
[138:52.88]I'm in prison!
[138:56.42]Oh boy.
[138:56.74]Why don't you warn me about your fucking friends in here?
[138:58.46]They're my friends!
[139:00.99]Oh my god!
[139:01.99]Everyone has a gun aiming at me!
[139:06.53]Stop!
[139:10.07]Vinny, there's so many people shooting weapons at me.
[139:11.71]Nice off.
[139:13.59]I'm trying to shoot weapons back at them.
[139:16.01]La la.
[139:18.07]Pow pow.
[139:19.15]I mean, pow.
[139:20.40]I was dead for at least three minutes because I recovered three grenades while I waited there.
[139:26.08]Wait, when you said la la, that wasn't a Teletubbies reference, was it?
[139:31.72]Um, no.
[139:32.52]I could see how you could put the two and two together though like that.
[139:35.71]Probably three no voices.
[139:37.50]Jerma, did you watch Doug when you were growing up?
[139:40.10]Oh, yeah.
[139:42.38]From memory, what was Mr. Dink's job?
[139:44.90]Do you remember?
[139:46.38]Mr. Dink?
[139:47.30]Hello, Douglas.
[139:50.08]That guy?
[139:52.54]Yeah, yeah.
[139:53.66]He was like a tinkerer.
[139:55.46]He was the Dinkster.
[139:58.70]You guys got it.
[139:59.40]Thank you.
[139:59.72]I'm just curious because some people don't know.
[140:02.46]Yeah, he was like a tinker.
[140:04.44]I don't know.
[140:05.42]Was he a teacher too?
[140:06.36]I don't remember.
[140:06.98]Oh my God.
[140:07.72]Somebody shooting from over there.
[140:10.18]Well, Dink is actually an acronym for double income, no kids.
[140:13.46]So him and his wife had no kids and they were just like gaming the system.
[140:17.02]So that's why he was called Mr. Dink.
[140:19.38]No way.
[140:20.18]Just like the Dinklebergs.
[140:22.10]It wasn't the Finster, his kid?
[140:25.00]I don't know who that is.
[140:26.27]The blue one.
[140:27.63]No, that's Skeeter.
[140:28.77]Dude, the best part about that, every time he would come on screen, he would always do like the... Wait, what did you just say?
[140:42.78]I was trying to say pox versus, but I just said talks and you shot.
[140:45.74]Oh, I thought you said something else.
[140:47.98]What do you think I said?
[140:49.12]Pox?
[140:49.76]We lose a bit of ourselves to the rise and grind.
[140:52.39]Don't you agree, Douglas?
[140:54.19]The flesh rots little by little.
[140:56.45]Yeah, up there.
[140:57.33]What the fuck?
[140:58.23]Okay, I got it.
[141:00.97]Whoa.
[141:03.53]Every day we strafe.
[141:04.88]I got jump scared.
[141:06.04]I got jump scared.
[141:06.74]I got jump scared.
[141:07.86]Got you.
[141:12.82]I'm going down now.
[141:14.46]Thank you.
[141:14.74]You got me back up.
[141:15.58]Oh, do you want health now?
[141:16.76]Do we want health or no?
[141:17.98]I don't think we can even use it really for the purple, right?
[141:20.88]Yeah, you're right.
[141:22.24]I'm sorry.
[141:22.54]I'm busy.
[141:23.00]I was busy dinking and not playing wisely.
[141:25.92]Of course.
[141:26.50]Of course, we bring up Mr. Dink and now we're going to lose the mission.
[141:31.16]Oh, no.
[141:34.08]This is actually literally what's going to happen.
[141:36.28]Oh, no.
[141:37.06]God damn it.
[141:41.30]I'm still thinking about the Finster.
[141:43.37]I just invented in my head who's not a character in Doug, but I've... He's my Doug OC.
[141:48.71]Finster.
[141:50.06]Yeah.
[141:50.72]He'd fit in.
[141:52.68]Finster?
[141:53.58]Are you thinking of... It's me, Finster.
[141:55.58]What are we doing today?
[141:56.58]No, you're talking about... Cleverser explains it all.
[142:00.30]That's Ferguson.
[142:01.16]Yeah, that was Ferguson.
[142:02.34]Ferguson?
[142:02.92]Yeah, I think that's who.
[142:03.54]And he's like, oh, it's me.
[142:05.08]It's me, Ferguson.
[142:06.02]And I annoy my sister.
[142:07.98]No, it's his whole personality.
[142:10.72]You're gaslighting Criken right now.
[142:13.06]Chuck, it's from Rugrats.
[142:15.58]No, it's not.
[142:16.36]Oh, God, you're right.
[142:17.12]Chuckie Finster.
[142:17.78]Chuckie Finster.
[142:18.58]Did I take the last name from Chuckie?
[142:21.18]Yep.
[142:21.30]Can I have nothing original?
[142:24.06]Do I have an original thought in my head?
[142:27.78]I mean, there was...
[142:30.23]a long time ago thank you oh my god thank you you got me back look guys I gotta go I just realized my oc's a lie did you take the health kit that I dropped no oh like a coward they all kind of are oh the dune world
[142:57.89]Access X size vault HL322791.
[143:02.19]Oh my God, they're just aiming at us from up here.
[143:03.81]I'm going to throw down some ammunition up here if anyone was looking for some ammo.
[143:14.24]Why would you put it before the drop down?
[143:15.56]Yeah, like in a very far spot.
[143:18.41]You guys are going to want to come over to my house if you need ammo.
[143:20.97]I've got a TV and a car.
[143:26.34]Anyone want to hang out?
[143:32.66]Jeez.
[143:34.85]I completed a penance.
[143:36.25]It's crazy looking.
[143:37.09]Nice.
[143:38.45]Penance.
[143:38.95]I don't know.
[143:40.81]Penance.
[143:41.71]Penance.
[143:43.53]That's what I'm saying.
[143:45.67]Somebody asked if I could look out the window and I was like, alright, why not?
[143:49.37]Is he there?
[143:56.99]Grenades here.
[144:03.41]Take those.
[144:04.82]Sick.
[144:06.10]You can't do that.
[144:07.34]His character screamed grenade finding one as if one were thrown at him.
[144:12.24]Right.
[144:13.16]Like if you're in a car and you scream like cat.
[144:17.16]You would imagine that you got to swerve.
[144:19.76]Yeah.
[144:20.86]Cat.
[144:21.34]I love mine.
[144:21.98]I just gave him this new food and he's really loving it.
[144:31.02]Sorry, I'm still thinking about... The Finster.
[144:34.20]The Finster, yeah.
[144:35.45]I think after this I might find like an online Doug RP forum and just... Dude, I dodged.
[144:41.35]I tried to dodge.
[144:42.07]I dodged back, but I didn't.
[144:43.27]I reloaded and my face is sweating.
[144:46.23]Criken, I got to show you this little Doug video.
[144:48.46]It's fresh in my mind because someone made a little animated short of some dumb bit with Mr. Dink that I did.
[144:53.42]I'll show you after the stream.
[144:54.76]It's fun.
[144:55.93]Uh-oh.
[144:56.53]And again, we are doing a Mr. Dink impression and getting attacked by a special enemy.
[145:00.28]Every time I do an impression, I get attacked.
[145:05.20]No, no, no.
[145:05.56]I'm going to stop.
[145:06.16]I'm going to stop.
[145:25.02]Somebody, you actually did that and got hit by the charge.
[145:28.10]That was perfect.
[145:28.82]It was actually perfect.
[145:31.90]There's a healing thingy here.
[145:33.84]This is the last thing before the end, I think.
[145:37.23]Yeah, Smush, you're probably going to want that.
[145:38.63]Serious fight, everyone.
[145:40.37]Recalibrate your brain.
[145:41.91]Yes.
[145:42.79]Seriously.
[145:43.37]Serious.
[145:43.87]No messing around.
[145:45.47]I have heals.
[145:46.51]I have heals.
[145:47.37]I got grenades.
[145:49.29]Okay.
[145:49.89]Wait.
[145:50.25]Hold on before you press the button.
[145:52.29]Everybody just go ahead and do it because we all want to.
[146:00.30]Only two of us did it, but it's okay.
[146:02.06]Alright.
[146:02.40]We got it out of my system.
[146:04.06]There's a bomber behind us.
[146:08.04]What the?
[146:09.88]I already have my armor gone.
[146:11.13]It's okay.
[146:12.57]It'll come back.
[146:12.97]It'll come back.
[146:13.83]What are we actually trying to do here?
[146:16.49]Retrieve the contagion samples.
[146:19.63]Oh.
[146:21.96]Or he did not say anything at the doggone end.
[146:25.05]I think Doug, that show, is probably the same age as some of your chatters.
[146:30.41]No one knows the fuck you're talking about.
[146:32.21]You play the game.
[146:33.81]That's so true.
[146:35.15]Nobody knows what this is.
[146:37.17]My chat, I see Mr. Dink kind of became a bit of a meme for me years ago.
[146:41.54]So...
[146:43.50]That was a good reaction.
[146:44.94]Concentrate.
[146:45.36]Stop talking about Mr. Dink or I'm going to fucking end.
[146:48.26]Alright, I'm going to...
[147:09.41]Alright, hop down here, I think.
[147:11.47]Wait.
[147:12.65]Fuck me.
[147:13.45]What is this?
[147:14.25]We need to put some sort of canister in here.
[147:19.68]I don't know where the canisters are though.
[147:21.38]Sniper!
[147:22.04]Sniper!
[147:25.22]Hey!
[147:26.04]We're losing this.
[147:28.94]There's no way.
[147:31.25]It's over.
[147:31.79]No, no.
[147:32.23]We can do this.
[147:33.15]Dude, you just went parachuting off my screen.
[147:38.91]We need to stay together.
[147:39.95]Stay together.
[147:40.43]Stay together.
[147:46.00]Thank you.
[147:47.94]No, no, no, no, no more dog.
[147:51.88]I'm down again.
[147:52.54]You dunked it.
[147:53.10]I'm down.
[147:53.60]Stop dunking.
[147:55.45]I'm a casualty now.
[147:58.24]Is he dead?
[147:58.72]Alright.
[148:01.50]Someone said we have to open these doors.
[148:04.74]Sniper.
[148:07.04]And then, yeah, open these doors.
[148:08.61]And then we put the canisters in the middle.
[148:12.99]Alright.
[148:13.25]In here.
[148:14.33]Oh, bingo.
[148:15.47]Bingo bango.
[148:16.31]Alright.
[148:16.83]We have to stay together.
[148:17.81]Stay together.
[148:18.53]We have to.
[148:19.03]I'm back.
[148:19.71]I'm back.
[148:20.13]Someone look to your prisoner or Criken, I think.
[148:22.15]Yeah, yeah.
[148:22.87]I'm right here.
[148:24.29]We need to open all these.
[148:25.41]Get them all open already.
[148:26.74]Alright, this one right here.
[148:27.56]Wanna grab that?
[148:28.02]Wanna bring it over here?
[148:28.86]Oh my god.
[148:29.64]Where does it go?
[148:30.56]Where does it go?
[148:31.52]Where does it go?
[148:32.04]Over here.
[148:33.20]Just bring it over here.
[148:34.60]Oh shit!
[148:35.22]I'm so sorry!
[148:36.04]No, no, no.
[148:36.82]Get us.
[148:37.20]Yeah, get us.
[148:40.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[148:48.29]You got this.
[148:48.77]I believe in you.
[148:49.67]Why is he screaming?
[148:52.03]Are you okay?
[148:52.75]No, I'm not okay.
[148:53.91]I'm almost dead for real.
[148:54.77]I'm almost dead for real.
[148:58.36]Yes!
[148:59.50]You did it.
[149:04.73]I'm putting heals down right here.
[149:05.95]Heals on heals.
[149:06.59]Heals down.
[149:06.93]Heals down.
[149:07.27]Heals down.
[149:07.59]Heals down.
[149:07.99]Everyone gather for heals.
[149:09.77]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[149:14.00]Okay, now don't run.
[149:15.58]We have to stay right next to each other.
[149:16.84]We need to literally be within one meter.
[149:20.02]So we're going to move this canister down here, right?
[149:23.16]Enemies.
[149:23.54]A lot of enemies.
[149:27.50]You guys do the moving, I'll do the killing, alright?
[149:30.64]I need that health again.
[149:31.76]I need the health again.
[149:33.47]It's gone.
[149:34.97]No, it's not.
[149:35.33]It's still here, but I'm gone now.
[149:37.87]What the heck is going on in the stairs?
[149:39.23]Alright.
[149:43.78]Dude.
[149:45.64]Yeah, me and prisoner are fucked.
[149:46.64]What the fuck?
[149:48.96]A lot of fire.
[149:50.14]What is this?
[149:51.10]Is it me?
[149:52.10]Am I putting the fire down?
[149:53.36]Where is this guy?
[149:54.58]I got him.
[149:55.06]There's two of them, actually.
[149:56.90]I got the other one.
[149:59.67]There's just so much fire.
[150:01.03]There's three of them.
[150:02.25]Alright, I'm going back for prisoner.
[150:06.51]Alright, come on, come on, come on.
[150:11.65]Stick together.
[150:12.85]Who even did... I'm dead.
[150:17.40]Somebody shot me.
[150:19.98]Alright.
[150:20.48]I'm back.
[150:21.22]It's alright.
[150:21.62]It's alright.
[150:22.10]We can get it.
[150:22.56]We can get it.
[150:23.20]You did not pick me up.
[150:24.70]Huh?
[150:26.43]No.
[150:26.79]And there's two of us now in the same spot.
[150:28.87]There's two of us in the same spot.
[150:30.31]It's fine.
[150:30.67]It's fine.
[150:30.89]We're going to be alright.
[150:31.55]We're good.
[150:32.39]Alright.
[150:33.65]Alright.
[150:35.21]Don't touch me.
[150:36.59]I think sometimes it does that.
[150:37.53]It's happened before.
[150:38.24]I'll get Ster.
[150:38.62]I'll get Ster.
[150:40.30]Oh.
[150:40.60]Thank you.
[150:41.04]Okay.
[150:41.54]We're back.
[150:41.94]We're back.
[150:42.24]We're back.
[150:43.00]Back in it.
[150:43.48]Back in it.
[150:44.00]Nothing happened.
[150:45.30]What the fuck?
[150:53.22]I'm just gonna do it.
[150:55.96]Alright.
[151:00.98]One down.
[151:01.59]Two to go.
[151:02.25]Two more.
[151:02.67]Two more.
[151:03.31]Together.
[151:08.87]Together.
[151:09.23]Together.
[151:09.53]Together.
[151:09.79]I'm with Copernicus.
[151:15.92]Watch out.
[151:16.78]Ster.
[151:17.14]You're gonna get... I think I'm a laggy boy.
[151:22.86]Uh-oh.
[151:24.56]You guys just stay there.
[151:25.60]Stick together.
[151:26.14]I'll run up and grab it.
[151:29.61]Criken, are we playing with three unplugged controllers right now and it's just you playing the game?
[151:36.27]I'm just trying to... I'm just trying to find the objectives, man.
[151:38.81]Alright.
[151:46.71]Let him do that.
[151:47.85]Behind you.
[151:48.35]The next one's over here.
[151:51.19]Maybe we go over there.
[151:51.93]Make your way around from that angle.
[151:53.42]Yeah.
[151:54.50]There's so many people with fire.
[151:55.66]It's ridiculous.
[151:56.20]Behind you.
[151:58.06]You're good.
[152:04.50]Okay.
[152:06.78]This whole upper deck, they just keep appearing behind you.
[152:09.77]What is going on, dude?
[152:11.77]Okay.
[152:12.81]Dog!
[152:13.25]Another one of these that we go to, but I don't know which one.
[152:21.19]We're good.
[152:21.47]We're good.
[152:21.69]Just keep moving.
[152:22.31]Keep moving.
[152:23.21]I don't know which one either.
[152:24.07]I don't know.
[152:25.01]One of these should be blue.
[152:26.29]There's a sniper.
[152:32.24]There's a lower floor?
[152:33.70]Fuck off.
[152:34.32]Alright.
[152:34.52]There is a lower floor.
[152:35.16]Alright.
[152:35.56]Let's go to the middle ring.
[152:36.94]There's too many people.
[152:38.42]There's too many people.
[152:40.50]Too many.
[152:40.86]Too many.
[152:41.32]Too many.
[152:41.76]Too many.
[152:43.25]Stick together.
[152:43.69]Alright.
[152:46.01]Come to the lower area with me.
[152:47.41]Everyone hop down.

[153:18.81]Oh my god!
[153:19.49]There's so many coming behind us.
[153:23.01]There's a lot of them.
[153:23.79]We need to get, we need to haul up in this room here.
[153:25.65]Everybody haul up in the room.
[153:26.33]Okay.
[153:27.80]Alright, there's one canister.
[153:28.82]There's a hundred million people behind you, Vinny.
[153:31.40]I know.
[153:32.48]Throw a grenade.
[153:36.00]Big guy with a big gun.
[153:38.24]I don't know what that thing is.
[153:42.86]Alright, we handled the crowd pretty nicely.
[153:45.56]Alright, if you want to carry the canister.
[153:48.94]Okay, I got it.
[153:50.04]Can I climb ladders while holding the canister?
[153:51.90]No, right?
[153:53.78]I'm down.
[153:54.82]Got it.
[153:59.11]Okay, we got... We need to find the ramp, which is over here.
[154:03.31]This way.
[154:03.81]This way.
[154:04.25]That could have gone a lot worse.
[154:06.23]We can also throw it, apparently.
[154:08.31]If Smush carries it, we go faster.
[154:10.03]I'll take it.
[154:10.41]Smush, get it.
[154:10.85]Right here.
[154:14.79]Alright.
[154:15.75]He's right here.
[154:17.51]Put it in the Hydron Collider.
[154:18.55]Okay, good.
[154:20.55]One more.
[154:20.91]Okay, where's the next one?
[154:21.83]I think the last one was also down here.
[154:24.11]Stay together.
[154:25.20]Move as one.
[154:26.16]Move as a unit.
[154:27.86]Try and get inside of it.
[154:28.70]There's a lot coming.
[154:29.28]Yeah.
[154:30.64]Alright.
[154:33.70]Inside where?
[154:34.80]Inside here, where we are.
[154:36.34]Oh, I went the wrong way.
[154:37.59]Oh, no!
[154:37.85]Alright.
[154:38.51]Nice to know you.
[154:40.59]No, no.
[154:40.85]We're good.
[154:41.13]We're good.
[154:43.85]Alright.
[154:44.13]Did you find it?
[154:44.71]Is it in there?
[154:45.47]I'm dead.
[154:45.91]Casualty.
[154:46.49]Uh-oh.
[154:47.43]Casualty.
[154:50.85]Send a letter home or something.
[154:54.53]Okay.
[154:54.81]We're okay though.
[154:57.81]Got it.
[154:58.17]Right here.
[154:58.91]Let's go.
[154:59.41]Let's go.
[155:00.19]Bingo.
[155:00.53]Let's get it.
[155:01.29]Let's go.
[155:01.57]Let's get it.
[155:01.97]Let's go.
[155:02.27]Let's get it.
[155:04.03]Let's go.
[155:04.37]Let's get it.
[155:04.79]Alright.
[155:06.37]I'm going to go up and get Vinny.
[155:13.60]I'm going with you.
[155:16.08]They pop out of that door right on top of you.
[155:18.96]Alright.
[155:19.40]Nice.
[155:19.99]Okay.
[155:21.95]You got Vinny.
[155:22.41]This is good.
[155:22.71]There's another phase to this.
[155:24.35]Oh, my goodness.
[155:25.51]Get up the stairs.
[155:26.57]Oh.
[155:28.53]Ow.
[155:31.21]Oh.
[155:32.79]Oh, I don't have any bullets or anything.
[155:33.99]We just have to go.
[155:35.69]Oh, they're coming from every direction.
[155:37.18]Alright.
[155:39.02]Hit the button.
[155:40.36]See what it says.
[155:48.70]Let's get out of here.
[155:50.62]We got to go down.
[155:51.34]Down.
[155:52.74]Alright.
[155:53.64]It's down.
[155:54.16]I'm down.
[155:54.82]I'm down.
[155:55.36]I'm down.
[155:55.62]I'm down.
[155:55.91]I got you.
[155:56.59]But not in the down the stairs kind of way.
[155:58.95]Yeah.
[155:59.31]Alright.
[155:59.63]Now let's go down the stairs kind of way.
[156:00.89]Okay.
[156:03.83]Perfect.
[156:04.43]Excellent.
[156:05.05]Oh, let's get out of here.
[156:05.83]I have never been more happy to leave a map in my life.
[156:10.35]This was an insanely difficult level.
[156:13.31]It's not over.
[156:14.89]We still have to get out of here.
[156:18.63]It's pretty far.
[156:19.89]This is kind of far.
[156:20.77]Someone still has a grimoire.
[156:22.01]Is that you, Criken?
[156:22.87]Yeah.
[156:23.77]Jesus.
[156:24.23]Oh, my God.
[156:27.68]There's a dink behind us.
[156:36.70]Yes.
[156:37.32]Oh, my God.
[156:38.64]For our own mortality is not anything to be feared.
[156:42.35]Thanks, Mr. Dinkster.
[156:43.79]For only being the finster.
[156:45.13]That was three stars.
[156:46.41]That was actually kind of cracked out.
[156:48.61]That was pretty cracked.
[156:50.69]Oh, God.
[156:52.17]That was some of the most fun I've had, but it was also some of the most, like, sweat.
[156:57.01]That was some of the most sweat I had.
[156:58.09]Am I going to get two levels from that?
[156:59.65]I got to wring out my underwear.
[157:03.69]Just all the piss.
[157:04.55]You're just constantly... I couldn't stop.
[157:09.07]Can't stop pressing.
[157:12.36]65 diamantine.
[157:13.06]That's pretty good.
[157:13.82]That's what you use to craft stuff.
[157:18.41]Wow, guys, that was amazing.
[157:19.69]Do you guys remember like 30 minutes ago when we were doing the Kermit the Frog thing?
[157:26.01]Was that my idea?
[157:26.65]I don't remember.
[157:29.75]Yeah, I think we just kind of fell into it.
[157:31.79]It's a pretty bad idea.
[157:33.49]Damn it, frog.
[157:34.83]I love Kermit the Frog.
[157:37.46]I would lay down my life for him.
[157:38.84]Your Ogryn looks like Trevor from GTA.
[157:46.69]Trevor's about that big.
[157:48.71]I think that'll be it for me, lads.
[157:52.75]That was a good one, too.
[157:54.75]Yeah, it's a good one to end on.
[157:56.73]It's a shame I never got to play a match with Connor.
[157:58.73]We talked for like 13 seconds and that was it.
[158:03.53]I wonder if Connor's still around.
[158:05.63]Yeah, we're just going to swap him out, you know.
[158:07.37]But no, seriously, Vinny, thanks for playing.
[158:10.83]This is great.
[158:11.57]I'm down for more if you're ever in the mood to play some more Warhammer, but...
[158:16.37]I appreciate the invite as always, man.
[158:17.95]Thank you.
[158:18.51]And, and Criken always, always a pleasure.
[158:21.39]Yeah, buddy.
[158:22.39]And, uh, Ster.
[158:23.67]It was really nice to meet you, man.
[158:24.87]I, I think, um, I think we had some good matches today.
[158:28.18]Yeah, it was fun.
[158:29.04]Uh, nice to meet you too.
[158:30.96]Well, take it easy guys.
[158:31.98]Bye.
[158:32.56]That's what it's all.
[158:33.10]That's what it's all about right there.
[158:34.94]That's right.
[158:35.48]Douglas.
[158:36.54]That's what it's all about.
[158:39.65]Like you and your friend skater.
[158:42.43]Bye.
[158:43.47]Say what I did.
[158:47.26]That was crazy.
[158:48.10]That was actually... I felt that one.
[158:51.26]That was an intense one.
[158:52.94]Oh, I got money too.
[158:54.96]I got a lot of money.
[159:03.89]What can I get?
[159:07.21]Oh, this thing's 200.
[159:08.27]Wait, is this a shield?
[159:09.27]Oh my god.
[159:12.34]Oh, my God.
[159:13.48]I think the plasma gun is a liability.
[159:17.33]It's difficult to use well.
[159:19.75]Yeah.
[159:23.39]I miss my other gun.
[159:24.85]We wish that on a happy birthday.
[159:26.53]Not getting offered high-level guns of good guns.
[159:31.30]Yeah.
[159:33.02]What constitutes a maniac?
[159:36.58]Maniac?
[159:37.38]Is it enemy type?
[159:38.58]Anyone who is a follower of your Steam group.
[159:43.46]The inhumane maniacs.
[159:46.49]I think.
[159:47.09]Yeah, but I mean, in the game.
[159:51.73]I think it's like the mutants and like the berserkers, like the cultist looking dudes with no clothes on.
[159:57.89]Oh, psychopaths.
[159:58.57]My bad.
[159:59.21]Yeah.
[160:01.01]Is this thing better?
[160:01.59]I mean, it does a little bit more damage.
[160:05.25]I like what this is better.
[160:06.53]Heavy attack is better.
[160:09.45]Cleave is better.
[160:10.03]Weapons have a rating.
[160:14.19]Plus 100% cleave on three seconds for multiple melee hit.
[160:17.13]That seems pretty amazing.
[160:21.96]How much money do I have?
[160:22.82]Whatever I want it.
[160:27.74]And stamina is stamina health or is no stamina is the bar that you did the running and stuff and dodging, right?
[160:34.40]Yeah.
[160:35.22]So this is +2 max stamina.
[160:36.86]What do we what do you have for stamina?
[160:38.24]Is it out of 10?
[160:39.04]That is out of 15.
[160:54.54]That's like a 30% increase.
[160:55.74]That's really good.
[160:56.52]Really?
[160:58.38]That seems pretty good.
[161:07.73]Class dependent.
[161:09.25]That means two more little bars.
[161:11.09]I'll get it.
[161:11.41]I mean, is it better than what I have here?
[161:14.35]Is it better to be able to run more and dodge more, or is it better to be able to be revived more than another extra time?
[161:20.95]Higher difficulty levels, you're going to need wounds, which lets you get revived more because they automatically reduce you by like two, I think, of the higher level ones.
[161:31.34]But for now, I think running and dodging is also good.
[161:34.72]I've never really noticed stamina upgrades because it's like just kind of a percentage, so I can't really tell.
[161:40.69]Let's see.
[161:41.65]I'll try it.
[161:43.11]Let's see if I notice a difference.
[161:49.66]new knife I kind of need a new weapon or I need to upgrade this one I it's usually a good idea as you're leveling up just to buy a new weapon every once in a while because yeah it your your armory rolls based on what your current highest like level items are not the ones equipped but just in your inventory yeah this thing's 167 damage this oh this green is what
[162:14.78]auto pistol I was using earlier was 21 on damage that I'll be right back oh yeah that was my entire time leveling all the way to 30 I didn't understand that system at all and I was using nerf weapons and I I understood it but I remember buying I was like yeah I'll just I bought it because it was a high item level not because I wanted to use it but then I saw it in my inventory I was like I'll give this one a try wait what do you mean
[162:40.29]It's kind of hard to explain.
[162:41.57]The item level stuff is kind of complicated, but if you mouse over any of your items... Tell me just the rating.
[162:46.55]Just the rating that's on the weapon.
[162:48.73]The rating is the number, like a literal number that goes into the stats of your item.
[162:54.75]And if you look at the modifiers, there's percentages for damage, mobility, penetration, yada yada.
[162:59.65]And so those percentages are reflective of how much...
[163:04.30]of the number of the rating has gone into each of those.
[163:07.14]So I would say a weapon with low percentage damage, then it's actually weak, you know, in terms of damage, but the rating is the overall power and then the bars are the distribution of that power.
[163:19.08]Oh, that's interesting.
[163:20.12]OK.
[163:23.60]That's very interesting.
[163:30.40]So let me.
[163:35.29]Didn't realize that.
[163:35.95]Yeah, interesting system.
[163:37.87]Okay.
[163:38.75]I think I understand it.
[163:40.71]And the other part is, so you know those grays, greens, blues, and purples, and legendary quality?
[163:49.56]As you move up that quality scale, it'll get a higher item rating, but it's dependent on what it was first at as a gray.
[163:59.32]So for example, the dagger I'm using, I technically got at level 20, so it's
[164:05.36]Not an endgame dagger.
[164:07.66]If I got a new dagger at level 30, it would have a higher ceiling and could be upgraded further.
[164:12.38]Yeah.
[164:13.99]So if you see a gray, it doesn't mean it's necessarily bad if it's got, like, a decent item rating level, because you can upgrade it, and then it'll, you know, reach higher than your existing stuff.
[164:28.72]Huh.
[164:30.76]Okay.
[164:31.12]Yeah.
[164:31.98]I'm still figuring it out, too.
[164:33.06]It's not...
[164:34.97]It's not solved by any means, but... How much money do I have?
[164:38.88]Somebody said I should buy something?
[164:42.34]I don't know.
[164:42.90]I think Connor might not be available.
[164:47.80]We may need to either do a random or fill.
[164:52.36]I'm down.
[164:52.90]It doesn't matter.
[164:53.38]I'm down for either one.
[164:55.99]If we can grab somebody, we can.
[164:57.15]Let me check with my other group.
[165:02.57]Let's see if Charbrook is still around.
[165:06.62]Yeah, I'm done.
[165:07.32]I'm done to play for like at least another.
[165:08.44]At least another couple missions.
[165:10.20]Your word is my law.
[165:23.94]I really want to.
[165:24.60]I saw stripping use this the other day and it was insane.
[165:29.08]Which one?
[165:30.58]That the heavy stubber, the heavy machine gun thing.
[165:34.85]Oh yeah.
[165:35.40]Twin linked, heavy, stubber.
[165:38.50]Yeah, that stuff's fun.
[165:40.55]Yeah, Charborg said earlier that he would be around, but it has been a couple of hours, so... I think he might be doing something else now.
[165:47.57]He's typing to me.
[165:53.90]I want to... Let me go to the... Where is the training dummy place?
[165:58.10]I've never seen it.
[166:00.04]It's...
[166:04.14]it's like a big circular room with a lady in a tube um do you ever you ever go to Disney world of disneyland like years ago and they had that one like alien escape ride yep there was like an alien in the tube in the middle of the room yeah it was terrifying yeah that's what you're looking for it's that room it's totally that that actually is pretty helpful because I'll know that exactly when I see it
[166:32.56]I'm going to say it's right over here.
[166:33.78]Yep.
[166:34.38]Alright, yeah, Charbrick says he's doing something else right now, but he'd be down later.
[166:44.06]The meat grinder.
[166:47.85]Oh, the meat grinder is what it's called.
[166:52.57]Yes, that's interesting.
[166:56.37]Unfortunately, Connor Connor's game is not working.
[167:02.85]Yeah, it looks like my other group is already a team of four, so probably can't grab anyone from them.
[167:09.98]Let me see.
[167:14.50]Let me take a look.
[167:20.23]Da-da-da-da.
[167:21.25]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[167:22.93]Da-da-da-da-da.
[167:27.56]Yeah, any game that has four player co-op, a lot of times it's funny when you get like two groups of three or two groups of like, you know, there's three and three and it's like, well.
[167:36.76]Yeah.
[167:42.82]We can just do it random.
[167:43.76]That doesn't matter.
[167:48.20]We could also do that.
[167:54.45]We could pull, I mean, who's playing it right now?
[167:57.11]Let's see.
[168:04.30]Is a raid coming in?
[168:05.44]Where?
[168:24.60]Oh, what happened to my game?
[168:25.46]It's all fuzzy.
[168:28.30]Is it fuzzy?
[168:29.58]Yeah, fuzzy.
[168:30.10]Now it's back.
[168:30.80]Is Ludwig playing it right now?
[168:38.11]Are you guys looking for a gamer?
[168:39.50]I don't think Ludwig is playing right now.
[168:43.62]Wait, Ludwig raided?
[168:44.60]No.
[168:45.22]Wait, was Ludwig just live?
[168:48.26]Oh.
[168:48.36]Okay.
[168:50.83]Well.
[168:51.31]Oh.
[168:52.17]Oh.
[168:53.05]Oh.
[168:53.39]No, he didn't.
[168:56.19]Ludwig did like a YouTube to Twitch raid.
[168:58.22]I think that's illegal.
[169:03.43]I think he sometimes would put like a link up.
[169:06.37]But I guess he didn't do it.
[169:07.53]I think people just... I'm being lied to.
[169:12.03]Alright.
[169:12.35]Well, I mean, who is... We could get... Let's see.
[169:16.05]Who's in my mod group?
[169:19.03]Oh, moderators.
[169:24.56]Who wants to play?
[169:27.08]Pick me.
[169:32.24]Here we go!
[169:33.00]I mean, I'll take anybody in here, in the mod group.
[169:48.23]I mean, everybody is calling for a very particular mod right now, and I don't know if they're available.
[170:01.62]Go, Josh, go.
[170:06.62]Me when he says, Jeremy says he needs plus one.
[170:11.50]Alright, we got it.
[170:14.00]VRJosh is going to play.
[170:19.17]Get him in this call.
[170:20.63]Yeah, I'm down for like another one or two.
[170:23.11]Okie doke.
[170:25.45]Come on in, Josh.
[170:28.31]Welcome to the party.
[170:29.27]I'll invite you to.
[170:36.58]Hello, hello, hello.
[170:37.85]There we go.
[170:38.19]It's working.
[170:38.59]Cool.
[170:39.11]What's up?
[170:40.85]Let me get the game up.
[170:45.27]Before you join, you should know that Sherman doesn't want us to do any funny voices.
[170:48.29]Right, yeah.
[170:48.85]No, no, I've seen, yep.
[170:50.33]Serious business only.
[170:51.37]Yeah, no, absolutely no funny.
[170:53.09]And look what happened.
[170:53.83]I mean, we did, there was some Mr. Dink in there, but.
[170:56.63]There was a little bit of Dink and a little bit of Doug, but.
[170:58.78]We were very, very serious.
[171:00.79]I mean, I'm not a professional comedian, so I'm very much just serious only, so yeah.
[171:05.71]Perfect.
[171:07.23]You're in the right place.
[171:08.27]VRJosh, I know that, you know, at least one or two people here.
[171:11.37]Yeah, I'm trying to think.
[171:13.15]Yeah, I have Criken, and then I think I played Pavlov with you in Ster years ago.
[171:16.91]Yep.
[171:17.69]Yep.
[171:18.77]Good to see you.
[171:19.93]They named Pavlov after the dogs.
[171:21.01]What do you think?
[171:22.14]Discuss.
[171:22.48]I don't know.
[171:24.58]Oh, wait, I just mentioned another game.
[171:25.76]Shit.
[171:26.50]Somebody said VRJosh is the stability that we needed.
[171:37.03]I feel bad for Connor.
[171:38.01]Getting the hub loaded.
[171:39.59]Yeah, Connor would have been fun.
[171:41.89]He was raring and ready to go, but apparently the game was having some issues with it.
[171:47.23]Yeah, probably launch day, there's always going to be some technical hiccups here and there.
[171:52.73]But hey, we got VRJosh, so we're ready to go.
[171:55.19]It's been mostly stable for me, thankfully.
[171:57.91]I turned RTX off, and that definitely helped frame rate and everything.
[172:01.21]Yeah.
[172:05.08]While we have a minute here, I do want to say, again, thank you, Warhammer, for the sponsor.
[172:09.88]I also want to say that the game is available.
[172:11.34]You can get it right now.
[172:13.16]Go to Steam.
[172:15.06]And let me just confirm this again.
[172:16.28]I want to make sure this is... The game is... The retail base price of the game is what?
[172:22.44]$40, I believe.
[172:22.84]And then there's a special edition for $60.
[172:24.52]$40.
[172:24.66]I think so, yeah.
[172:28.76]$40.
[172:29.94]Come on, Gwen.
[172:34.06]I think you might have left the group.
[172:35.32]I'm not sure what the... Did I?
[172:38.28]I'm just in here.
[172:39.36]Oh, I think maybe... Yeah, I don't see... Oh, it's because I think I went... Alright, yeah.
[172:45.61]Should I remake the party?
[172:46.99]Because I got Josh here.
[172:49.97]Yeah, if you just want to... Yeah, I'll invite you guys.
[172:55.84]I think I can't be... Can you not be in the training area?
[173:01.00]I don't know.
[173:01.42]I've done it before, but... Wait, how many dollars is it?
[173:08.98]Warhammer, $40.
[173:10.32]Okay, I can't join you either, huh?
[173:24.37]Grump.
[173:25.19]Now I have to deal with chat.
[173:26.41]Uh-oh.
[173:29.61]I mean, it's not like we have only two mods.
[173:31.49]We have 15.
[173:35.59]I actually might have DC'd.
[173:37.35]Maybe that's what happened.
[173:39.15]Oh, no.
[173:39.51]I'm good.
[173:40.77]Alright, let me see if I can get invites going again here.
[173:45.76]I can't invite to any strike team.
[173:47.52]Let me just relog.
[173:50.40]I think that's what's going on.
[173:51.10]It should be online, but yeah.
[173:54.42]I think I DC'd and I can't connect back in.
[173:58.60]Let's try it again.
[174:07.17]Relaunching.
[174:08.01]60 minutes slow mode.
[174:26.33]What's the longest slow mode?
[174:29.27]30 minutes, I think.
[174:30.95]30 minutes slow mode.
[174:33.40]So you get one message every 30 minutes?
[174:35.46]That's... Is it even a chat room or is it a forum at that point?
[174:39.90]Are you making fun of my chat?
[174:41.66]You have 30 minutes slow mode on?
[174:42.82]They can type faster.
[174:46.08]You have 30 minutes slow mode?
[174:48.21]No, that's just how often people message.
[174:53.99]No, what do you mean?
[174:54.85]People talk in your chat all the time.
[174:57.46]Yeah, but I'm getting them angry for the engagement.
[175:02.24]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[175:03.88]Yeah, it blew up after that.
[175:05.34]It's great.
[175:08.34]I get paid by the message actually on Twitch.
[175:10.40]It's true.
[175:11.14]It is true.
[175:14.08]Alright.
[175:14.62]Let's get this rolling here.
[175:17.14]It's weird.
[175:18.09]Maybe I have to restart too.
[175:19.09]I can't join or invite you to my strike team.
[175:22.60]I restarted just because why not?
[175:24.08]Yeah, I re-logged it.
[175:25.08]Just figured.
[175:26.16]I want to point out this wasn't happening before Josh showed up.
[175:28.86]Yeah, my bad.
[175:30.38]He infected all of our computers.
[175:33.06]I guess maybe I'll try restarting too.
[175:34.26]I don't know.
[175:39.77]It's not Tuesday Steam maintenance.
[175:43.13]No, we can't blame it on maintenance today.
[175:48.61]I think I DC'd.
[175:50.45]Let me see if I can...
[175:53.67]I cannot invite anybody to a strike team.
[176:02.27]I'm logged into Steam, right?
[176:05.24]Yeah, it shows you online.
[176:17.46]Maybe can I do... Let's see.
[176:20.32]I do have an invite from you, though.
[176:25.70]Oh, you sent me a friend request.
[176:28.54]Oh, shit.
[176:30.43]I'll accept that.
[176:34.91]Okay, now I can invite Ster to my strike team.
[176:37.01]It's the only person I can right now, though.
[176:39.09]Yeah, I just logged in again.
[176:40.53]Hey.
[176:41.79]There we go.
[176:44.01]Ster, would you mind going over the backstory of your character, Prisoner, again?
[176:46.95]Oh, I...
[176:48.29]need Jerma's permission because he's already heard it and I'm a non-double tell same story oh yeah that is another rule cross my heart hope to die need permission uh you have the backstory the the prisoner you're a prisoner or something uh my so my last name is prisoner it's just a coincidence but also crazier coincidence wait no wait we wrote the backstory okay start over
[177:12.98]know how you have a job and like people's like in fantasy times their their last name was based on their job yeah that's me so like three generations ago my great great grandfather he said that the emperor doesn't wipe and they sentenced our whole family lineage into prison so now it's like it's just a last name it's a family name oh I got you right thank you for asking I appreciate it oh uh I think we got everybody
[177:42.73]We're missing VRJosh.
[177:43.41]Yeah, I tried joining through Steam and it said unable.
[177:47.17]I think it's because he joined me while I was joining him.
[177:49.17]So try joining again.
[177:51.09]I just sent you another invite.
[177:52.09]Let's see if you get it.
[177:53.31]Oh, there it is.
[177:53.83]Now it popped up.
[177:54.35]Yeah.
[177:54.85]Alright, let's go.
[177:55.49]There we go.
[177:57.77]It took an extra minute or so.
[177:59.03]It's okay.
[177:59.91]We thinking you want to stick with the threes?
[178:02.07]How are you feeling?
[178:04.17]I think, I don't know why.
[178:07.06]I wasn't showing the screen the whole time.
[178:08.28]Sorry about that.
[178:11.41]Uh-oh.
[178:12.63]Uh-oh.
[178:13.93]Uh-oh.
[178:14.23]Uh-oh.
[178:15.33]I was bouncing around a little.
[178:16.83]I was bouncing around.
[178:20.29]Quick, get us in an instance.
[178:21.69]Get us in a new instance, quick.
[178:23.65]Do you want to do a three again?
[178:27.79]Let's go with a nice simple two at this point, right?
[178:30.23]Nice little simple two.
[178:31.34]Let's chill it out with a two.
[178:32.82]I can get a better place down.
[178:37.52]Simple two.
[178:38.16]Nice simple two.
[178:43.00]Why not?
[178:44.34]Have a relaxing session.
[178:53.87]Drops waiting room.
[178:55.12]They're on.
[178:57.34]How long do you have to watch to get a drop?
[179:00.30]It's like 30 minutes.
[179:02.12]It's 30 minutes.
[179:04.78]Then you need to claim it, and there's like eight drops, but you have to claim it in order to get the next drop.
[179:10.92]Oh.
[179:11.98]Yeah, so just go to the drop page every time you get it.
[179:15.94]So you should be able to get everything available over the course of three or four hours, right?
[179:19.72]Yeah, cool.
[179:21.38]Yeah, I think they did split some of the drops onto different days.
[179:24.39]I think there were some for the pre-launch beta stuff.
[179:28.27]Cool.
[179:31.95]Alright, let's go for it.
[179:34.12]It's time.
[179:34.77]Headphones going in.
[179:35.39]Thank you for your patience, by the way.
[179:54.51]I put this gun on, but I don't know if I really don't really want it.
[179:59.29]Or the devil.
[180:00.79]Oh no, that's just the symbol.
[180:22.12]Oh my goodness, this guy has a lot of health.
[180:29.30]I do like this new knife though.
[180:33.34]It's pretty good.
[180:34.96]Knife is the way to go.
[180:37.38]I am the Call of Duty.
[180:41.41]I thought you just died.
[180:44.15]Who?
[180:45.05]Was that body that fell over?
[180:46.09]I thought it was his body.
[180:58.63]Okay, okay.
[181:01.33]A tactical nuke inbound.
[181:04.91]Calling in a care package.
[181:15.66]I'm bringing it back.
[181:16.50]I'm bringing it back.
[181:17.18]I don't care what anybody says.
[181:19.86]Bringing what back?
[181:21.15]Fireman?
[181:22.15]No.
[181:22.47]He's bringing fireman back.
[181:25.15]Fireman confirmed for next Jerma Rumble.
[181:32.25]I got a big guy tackler mutant.
[181:49.58]I can't wait to get that shield.
[181:52.32]Oh yeah, I think you're close.
[181:54.40]Like 10, you get it?
[181:55.76]Oh dude, they don't get it.
[181:58.12]the like I thought they just got it because I had some uh I had some uh I had some trash talkers in the chat earlier saying like Jerma really needs to get a shield right now like he's if he's trying to tank he needs the shield and he's really kind of throwing by not equipping one wow oh that is demoralizing if I heard that I probably would quit I would stop streaming
[182:23.57]You see what I'm seeing?
[182:24.43]That's gross.
[182:25.63]Ugh.
[182:27.57]Oh, it's on my face.
[182:29.91]Ugh.
[182:35.74]Don't eat me.
[182:36.40]You eat me.
[182:37.02]He eats me every single time.
[182:39.48]I've been swallowed every time.
[182:41.42]Oh, he's trying to get away with him.
[182:49.75]I know.
[182:50.05]He got me.
[182:52.63]Put me in such a bad place.
[182:55.03]We're good.
[182:55.31]We're good.
[182:58.53]The health station here too.
[183:00.93]Alright, we're okay.
[183:02.51]Yeah.
[183:02.79]Might as well use this here.
[183:04.49]Yeah.
[183:05.35]Yeah.
[183:05.73]Yeah.
[183:07.11]Are you going to shoot that guy or are you going to just let him shoot me?
[183:13.43]Oh, sorry.
[183:13.73]I thought you were Ster.
[183:15.69]Oh, let me tone down my response.
[183:19.82]god I'm sorry you talk to your mods this way dude you don't know what the private chat's like watch out we got some zeds ow ow ow too many who there are people behind us
[183:48.43]Yeah, we got some sets.
[183:49.47]I said that.
[183:52.37]What's one of my comms?
[183:53.09]I think the scariest picture I have on my phone is still when Jermaine gave me the death glare when I tried to take his chicken tender to the dollhouse.
[184:06.28]I haven't thought about it since then.
[184:09.34]Is this stuff that pops up every now and again?
[184:12.80]Yeah, do you like how your phone's like, oh, three years ago, this memory, it's like just this fucking death.
[184:16.74]It's like a scary image.
[184:18.91]Yeah.
[184:20.15]Hop down, hop down.
[184:22.15]You got trapped up there.
[184:22.93]That would have been bad.
[184:29.10]Nobody touches my chicken tenders.
[184:34.61]That was so cursed, because that was taking the same time that Jacob was having an allergic reaction to lavender hand sanitizer.
[184:47.68]Yeah, that is a pretty cursed image.
[184:54.06]These references are making me feel kind of excluded.
[184:58.15]I'm sorry.
[184:58.69]Sorry.
[184:58.99]I'll send it to you directly.
[185:02.45]So you can watch it.
[185:03.61]Yeah, okay.
[185:04.61]Stop excluding.
[185:05.99]When we didn't...
[185:17.55]You heard the whole story.
[185:18.93]All the context was there.
[185:23.49]Hey, Ster, Criken wasn't there when you shit your pants in Overwatch.
[185:27.98]Well, I didn't bring that up.
[185:29.70]Yeah, but like, so we can't have experiences with all kinds of other people?
[185:36.20]I would love to have a similar experience with him, but I don't know if he plays Overwatch.
[185:42.48]Well, we're both playing Dark Tyrant now.
[185:43.66]What's stopping you?
[185:44.56]Yeah, what's not?
[185:45.26]Go on, shit your pants.
[185:46.81]well alright alright ah fine you're next toward I got a power up a little were you like sick or something is there more context to that or I I really wanted to win a quick play game and like I really had to go
[186:07.95]I don't think I was sick.
[186:09.19]I think it was just like I really had to go.
[186:11.15]Just really impatient.
[186:12.45]Wait, hold on.
[186:14.39]It's multiplayer.
[186:15.81]Ster, you forgot to say this was when we were live on Twitch.
[186:21.17]Oh, yeah.
[186:22.33]Me and Jerma were playing.
[186:23.17]We were streaming.
[186:23.61]It was quick play.
[186:24.91]And I really wanted to win the match.
[186:26.51]And I didn't want to get up.
[186:28.26]If I didn't keep gaming, we were going to lose.
[186:32.00]Yeah.
[186:32.40]Ilios.
[186:34.22]Oh.
[186:34.60]King of the Hill.
[186:35.72]Oh, yeah.
[186:36.18]That's intense.
[186:37.88]Yeah, it was like one more point.
[186:39.54]I gotta win this.
[186:40.78]You know, I shit myself a little.
[186:42.50]But this is not made up.
[186:43.38]This is actually that people are like, oh, haha, what a funny story.
[186:45.63]No, he shit his pants when we were streaming Overwatch.
[186:50.69]This is not a made up story.
[186:51.97]I don't even know what I would do in that situation.
[186:55.65]It sounds like you were clear and transparent with everyone about it immediately.
[187:01.14]yeah when we did uh there was like a Twitch rivals for Overwatch I think I did and they're like hey write in any extra info you want to you know say about yourself like yeah I myself wants to win a quick play game like I'm open about it I'm pretty proud honestly I feel like it shows my dedication as a streamer and a gamer yeah and just yeah loyal friend like when the stakes are low they don't matter it's not ranked and you're just goofing off with your friends I'll be the guy himself to win
[187:27.20]Yeah, the fact that it was quick play is just like... You could have just walked away.
[187:33.63]You could have just left.
[187:34.91]I think we got to come up here and drop down.
[187:40.65]Go up or down?
[187:41.97]Wait, would we... Oh.
[187:43.11]Go upstairs and then drop down here.
[187:46.11]I looked at that wall like four times.
[187:47.86]It looks like there's kind of a ladder.
[187:49.40]There is.
[187:51.22]No.
[187:52.84]It's an optical illusion.
[187:54.08]Trapper.
[187:55.71]I mean, honestly, could we make fun of you for that?
[187:59.92]I don't think so.
[188:00.96]I really don't.
[188:01.52]I'm being honest.
[188:02.04]I think you can only make fun of someone if they're ashamed about it.
[188:04.62]Right.
[188:05.04]You can make fun of me, but, like, I... Okay.
[188:09.15]Who cares?
[188:09.55]Alright.
[188:12.45]Yeah, I don't think that's even... Oh, whatever.
[188:14.43]Like, yeah, I shit my pants.
[188:15.37]Who cares?
[188:15.91]Yeah, who cares?
[188:16.59]Oh, he hits that weird music, man.
[188:23.88]it doesn't it doesn't like define me but also if you want to define me by that I'm fine with it you know oh this is a bit of a maze here right now yeah we just have to go down here I think and then you go around scanning yeah I very often um you know going to the gym got a trainer working out going hard um
[188:48.34]I thought I almost was gonna shit myself doing like a spot once like every once in a while, you know I'll like do a squat and like fart, you know, it's just shit happens, you know, I I don't have the I don't know the word that will control.
[189:06.67]No, I don't The foul control Somebody ashamed of
[189:15.62]It happens to people in their age, especially.
[189:23.50]Oh, yeah.
[189:23.94]Sphincter Fortitude, I think, is the type of monster.
[189:27.06]I'll go with Sphincter Fortitude.
[189:33.92]Like, what's the point, honestly, in society where, like, oh, I got to, like, put this much effort into holding a singular fart.
[189:39.68]Like, I'm straining and sweating.
[189:41.31]Like, why not just do it?
[189:44.06]I think that's what Nurgle teaches.
[189:46.61]I am the wrong person to be in a call talking about this.
[189:49.71]Dude, if I have to fart, I will go to a different country to do it.
[189:54.23]You know what I mean?
[189:54.73]Like, I don't want to be in the same room as anybody.
[189:58.10]I will literally get on a train for an hour and then to go fart, not be around anybody.
[190:03.91]Is it like an advantage train?
[190:06.29]Okay.
[190:06.91]Here's the stipulation.
[190:09.47]You show up to work out.
[190:11.87]You go to, you go, you're going to do a deadlift.
[190:13.67]And as you go down, you know that if you like strain your body, you're going to fart.
[190:17.99]You just, you wuss out and you don't deadlift.
[190:21.50]Like there's no way around.
[190:22.60]You have to like, hold on, hold on.
[190:23.98]I got to go like clear my bowels.
[190:25.90]There's an ammo thing here.
[190:28.56]I need an answer.
[190:31.32]Wait, hold on.
[190:31.88]Say everything again.
[190:33.85]I don't think your chat wants me to.
[190:36.15]No?
[190:36.37]I don't think anyone wants to hear it again.
[190:40.27]Whoa!
[190:40.87]Not like a gross part.
[190:42.01]They're bored of it.
[190:42.93]They've moved on.
[190:56.43]You're a coward, Jerma.
[190:58.08]What?
[190:58.32]Why?
[190:58.60]I have to put the Sammo down.
[191:01.30]I need it.
[191:01.60]Oh, okay.
[191:02.38]Well, I just grabbed another one, so we're good now.
[191:04.48]Yeah, good.
[191:06.14]You carry a lot of shame.
[191:07.62]Why am I a coward?
[191:08.54]I literally just was like, hey, let's talk about when we pooped our pants before.
[191:12.87]No, you're a coward for not wanting to fart in a room with other people.
[191:16.67]And...
[191:19.52]oh that we pooped our pants it was Ster pooped his pants and you made fun of him for it oh yeah when Overwatch 2 beta was out I almost did it again with stripping did you realize it was really close I really thought it was going to happen again but I I guess I've grown a little over the years it's good to have like markers for yourself you set milestones well the worst part I shouldn't have stood the gate what the hell
[191:42.14]The worst part is when you are like, oh, hey guys, be right back.
[191:44.48]I gotta, uh, I gotta call my mom or something, right?
[191:46.66]And you go to another room.
[191:48.64]And you just, you just make sure that, like, nobody can see or hear you.
[191:51.74]And it's just like, you just go for it.
[191:53.98]And somebody ends up, it's so long.
[191:55.92]It's like a, you know what, let's just, can we talk about the Bible instead?
[191:59.52]You know what I mean?
[192:00.04]Like, I think it's probably a better topic.
[192:02.36]Who's your favorite apostle?
[192:05.33]This, I love the way this place looks.
[192:10.54]This is great.
[192:11.04]I love these big chains with the spikes on them.
[192:13.13]Yeah.
[192:15.67]Oh, that stung.
[192:17.53]That's sharp.
[192:18.27]There's one of the halo like skulls up there you got to get.
[192:21.27]Oh, yeah.
[192:31.46]I like this tractor get in here.
[192:33.24]These two star missions just like nice.
[192:36.84]Yeah, they're definitely... Compared to the three-star, they feel like a K4.
[192:40.66]Criken, Criken.
[192:41.85]Come over here for a sec.
[192:42.73]Just back here for one sec.
[192:45.11]Did you tell anybody else about what you... Hold on.
[192:47.95]What?
[192:48.05]Someone's starting a grill back there.
[192:52.76]Shh.
[192:54.13]I saw... What?
[192:55.27]Okay.
[192:55.67]You know what?
[192:56.09]Never mind.
[192:56.53]They detect conversations.
[192:58.14]They don't want it.
[192:59.92]I was... Never mind.
[193:00.82]Okay.
[193:01.62]Okay.
[193:03.78]So, I was going to make a thing where you... Oh, you took that crafting material and didn't say anything.
[193:08.46]But, never mind.
[193:09.32]We can't even make the joke.
[193:10.88]Yeah.
[193:11.24]They're also shared between everyone, so... Oh, okay.
[193:15.86]Well, nice.
[193:16.30]Good pickup.
[193:23.01]Do a backflip?
[193:26.76]Holy shit, he did it.
[193:28.64]We can just get to the elevator, right?
[193:32.62]Yes.
[193:33.98]Watch for flankers.
[193:36.08]Thanks, man.
[193:38.45]Thanks, man.
[193:42.97]Josh, your character looks cool.
[193:45.21]Yeah, I mean, I got the pre-order armor.
[193:48.03]What the hell was that?
[193:53.30]That's the special veteran sharpshooter thing that you can do where you trip all of the guys.
[193:58.34]That would be so funny.
[194:01.53]Here comes the swarm.
[194:02.57]No.
[194:06.63]Is it a big slug guy?
[194:08.15]Just a lot of little guys.
[194:30.40]Oh my goodness, sorry.
[194:34.26]Oh my god, I thought you were a bad guy again.
[194:36.21]Well, no friendly fire, thankfully.
[194:41.10]I wonder if that's going to be a modifier.
[194:43.54]Oh, yeah.
[194:44.26]Yeah.
[194:44.62]I mean, my feeling is that they had friendly fire at one point, and then after testing, they're like, this is actually not fun and really hard.
[194:51.72]So they decide not to.
[194:53.12]Especially when you have different sized characters that look like the enemy.
[194:57.47]Can they climb?
[194:59.43]We're getting separated.
[195:00.47]We're getting very separated.
[195:02.67]Can we get up to the prisoner?
[195:04.39]This is the beat.
[195:07.75]There was a charger guy, but he couldn't climb the ladder.
[195:10.85]Oh!
[195:11.31]What?
[195:12.71]That's the guy.
[195:13.41]That's what the guy was just talking about.
[195:16.67]Like, as you're saying, he couldn't climb the ladder.
[195:18.47]I see him running up the stairs behind you.
[195:19.74]Jesus.
[195:27.26]Oh, we got a hack on.
[195:27.88]Alright.
[195:34.81]Oh, another one.
[195:52.64]It's pretty crazy how big the jump is from two to three.
[195:55.60]Yeah, this is a big one.
[195:58.42]I guess even like three to four and four and five are kind of similar in my opinion, but just no room for error.
[196:05.73]So is the jump from three to four as big as the jump from two to three?
[196:10.11]Close, yeah.
[196:11.09]I'd say three to four.
[196:15.47]Yeah, it's probably two to three is big, three to four is bigger, and then four to five is just like...
[196:21.81]How would you even... As hard as that was for us to do that three on that mission, I can't even imagine that on a five.
[196:29.80]It's really about, like, positioning and communication.
[196:33.55]Like, there's just constant hordes, so you have to, like, you know, Ogryn in front with the shield, like, you know, with the flamers constantly burning them around.
[196:41.69]And then, like, the marksman has to be sniping the specials.
[196:47.11]So it's, like, you just got to be on top of your game.
[196:49.00]And everyone has, like, a very specific role.
[196:50.76]You kind of comp rather than just doing whatever you want.
[196:53.68]Yeah, just tons of communication.
[196:59.52]When it works, it feels so good.
[197:01.54]It's really, really rewarding.
[197:03.78]You also get like...
[197:11.02]you get like two to three times the rewards that we're getting right now.
[197:14.56]Just even if you fail, just like getting farther.
[197:19.74]So really, even if you fail it?
[197:21.67]Yeah.
[197:22.39]Yeah, you get rewards for fail.
[197:23.57]Oh, I just got launched.
[197:25.15]Wait, I'm alive.
[197:26.19]Holy shit.
[197:26.73]How do I get back up there?
[197:27.53]Oh, you're good.
[197:29.77]Oh, there's a trapper between me and you guys though.
[197:32.09]I think we can run down there.
[197:33.18]It's actually a grenade here.
[197:34.20]Okay, I got it.
[197:35.74]Wow, that was...
[197:40.89]But yeah, I was gonna say, I feel like these developers have figured the proper sequel to the Left 4 Dead formula by adding all these objectives and things like that.
[197:51.02]But for a long time, nobody could figure out how to
[197:54.11]how to develop the genre any further.
[197:56.55]I agree.
[197:57.61]This just feels like a continuation.
[198:00.07]I also like it's a weird take, I guess, that it did launch with a lot less content than Vermintide has, but I kind of like that because it gives longevity to the game.
[198:09.69]It's not like we just, oh, we played it, we're done.
[198:12.26]Like, there's a lot of stuff to look forward.
[198:13.90]Like, the game is still fun and enjoyable.
[198:16.34]Like, just, like, oh, we beat it.
[198:18.10]I felt like it was more focused on, like, polishing the gameplay loop than it was on just, like, jam-packing it full of stuff.
[198:24.55]Well, the thing is, people have tried to do that formula for a long time.
[198:28.79]People have really tried.
[198:33.67]I can't think of anything.
[198:34.51]I mean, this is probably... I mean, I know it's a sponsor stream, but I... Honestly, the...
[198:42.49]This feels the most fun to play out of any of the other games that are in this category that I've played in a long time.
[198:48.19]Yeah, there's some people shooting over there.
[198:51.20]There he comes.
[198:54.24]Flame.
[199:07.57]Oh my, that's a lot of people right here.
[199:10.76]A lot of gunners.
[199:19.02]Ow.
[199:19.16]Oh my god, how did you get up there?
[199:27.22]Oh my goodness, I just destroyed that guy.
[199:30.64]That was so cool too.
[199:31.82]There he is.
[199:41.39]You didn't even know that was happening.
[199:49.22]Don't knock me off.
[199:56.92]Took a while for Vermintide to get to where all the content has.
[200:00.36]Yeah, they did like regular updates for a long time and they added like subclasses and everything.
[200:03.00]That's what I'm looking forward to is like there's definitely going to be subclasses for each of these.
[200:07.00]So if you're like I want to be you know like an Augurn that's all melee based versus like all you know protection based, they'll probably eventually include that.
[200:17.00]Yeah I want to be- I want to be a rep pally.
[200:20.00]Yeah, it's kind of what sell it is to be honest.
[200:23.00]I have no idea what a rep pally is, but I hear people say it a lot. I just want to be clear.
[200:29.84]Uh-oh, I got down.
[200:32.24]I got down.
[200:39.97]One subclass added per quarter, so all four should enter subclass in a year.
[200:43.65]I saw something earlier.
[200:46.94]Somebody said, why does nobody play the psychic class?
[200:52.51]Oh, they do.
[200:54.23]Do they?
[200:55.35]I think, yeah.
[200:55.79]I've seen a few people.
[200:57.37]The consensus I've heard is that the Psyker is kind of annoying to level, but at late game, it's maybe the most damage in the game.
[201:04.64]Yeah, I've been hearing that a lot, that until you get to level 10, you have nothing to do.
[201:09.08]Yeah.
[201:11.46]It was like... Oh, that was the end of the level.
[201:16.18]Yeah.
[201:17.15]This is just a quick little two.
[201:18.21]That was a two.
[201:20.71]We'll do that.
[201:21.09]Let's do two.
[201:21.44]I mean, three.
[201:22.68]Sorry.
[201:27.10]Level up.
[201:33.59]Ooh.
[201:36.43]Thank you, Emperor.
[201:38.43]Jerma, what's your workout routine, Jerma?
[201:40.87]I don't want to show my armpits.
[201:48.02]I got the shield, finally.
[201:50.45]Nice.
[201:52.19]Oh, you do?
[201:52.61]Nice.
[201:52.85]Yeah, nice.
[201:53.81]You can place that too, right?
[202:00.15]New gray shovel.
[202:08.45]Dude, we've seen them at their worst.
[202:10.60]Why do you care?
[202:11.20]You've seen your pits at their worst?
[202:15.98]Yeah, I don't know, dude.
[202:16.84]I have a weird stream.
[202:21.59]Let's try this new gun.
[202:25.71]I mean, I'll take a look at them after the stream of this sort now.
[202:31.17]Blue.
[202:37.69]Oh, what a sick shovel.
[202:40.04]Oh, my God, the shovel was forged by the gods.
[202:42.82]I got a blue sword.
[202:46.82]I can get a new bolt gun.
[202:48.52]I feel like having these new feats make, like, it changes.
[202:54.44]What I'm reading right now is literally changing everything about this character.
[202:58.66]That's what I mean.
[202:59.66]Level 10 is huge for the game.
[203:02.92]And also, when you hit level 10, that's when you start getting, like, the armor will show you new weapons that are class-specific.
[203:10.24]So if you... It just feels like it opens up a lot of new stuff that you can do.
[203:15.70]Plus 50% melee damage and plus 50% damage reduction to these different enemies.
[203:23.83]That seems kind of insane.
[203:27.85]50% more damage, melee damage, to these different enemies?
[203:34.04]Jeremy, you should do a stream where you swim in the open ocean with sharks and see what makes them tick.
[203:41.38]That's not a good idea.
[203:44.70]What is this one?
[203:55.47]So the grenades actually explode now.
[203:58.49]I actually have grenades that blow up now.
[204:00.38]And it's not just a box.
[204:01.14]Just throwing an empty box.
[204:02.22]Yeah.
[204:04.24]I think I saw some.
[204:04.98]There's like a cluster grenade thing for the.
[204:07.54]I think the way it works is if you throw the box and it hits a piece of armor, then it turns into a cluster bomb and explodes.
[204:14.04]Oh, cool.
[204:16.06]I feel like I have to take this, though.
[204:17.87]That's just so... That's so much more help.
[204:24.81]Alright, cool.
[204:27.61]I also regenerate your grenades.
[204:30.47]You do?
[204:30.69]Yeah, if you're near me, there's a 5% chance on every kill that you get a grenade.
[204:39.28]really that's cool yeah man that's synergy bro yeah bruh oh on a lean enemy kill never mind there's only elites but still chance chance for grenade alright what about money what about weapons I need you know what I want a big chunky two-hander that's what I want can I do this is that in the game have you guys unlocked the uh
[205:07.22]Yeah, it's definitely in the game.
[205:08.06]Have you guys unlocked the weekly reward stuff?
[205:13.54]The contracts?
[205:14.70]It's 11 for them.
[205:16.30]Oh, shit.
[205:16.72]Okay.
[205:17.32]Not quite.
[205:17.86]A little further.
[205:20.98]Let's go to the store.
[205:31.12]Oh, there's one here, but I can't afford it.
[205:35.82]Yes, I can.
[205:36.24]You can break down weapons you have that you aren't using to get a little more money.
[205:40.88]That's true.
[205:41.48]Is that the best thing to do with the low-level ones, right?
[205:45.77]Just break them down?
[205:47.57]Yeah.
[205:51.87]Did you say that a gray can actually be pretty good?
[205:54.83]What's the number that I should really be looking at?
[205:56.63]Just like the item level?
[206:00.07]It's hard to say.
[206:01.67]It's hard to say.
[206:02.75]Basically, if there's a weapon you really like using and you see a gray version of it,
[206:10.11]that's new in the store, picking it up is usually good because you can then upgrade it and it'll become higher level than the other stuff.
[206:18.94]Interesting.
[206:19.54]Okay.
[206:20.44]Once you start leveling further, then you're just going to surpass it again.
[206:25.35]Yeah, I would figure at your current level, just try out new weapons.
[206:29.91]Yeah.
[206:30.19]See what weapon style you prefer because you're just going to outlevel most of this stuff eventually anyways.
[206:36.81]Okay.
[206:40.90]Well, I definitely want to buy that.
[206:42.66]Alright, I'm going to be shield.
[206:51.83]What slot is it in?
[206:54.75]Oh, it's the melee slot.
[206:58.07]Hmm.
[206:59.97]Well, that's not... I need to change my feet then.
[207:10.50]Actually, no, that's still alright.
[207:14.78]Wait, you get a club?
[207:19.76]Oh, okay.
[207:20.28]So it's a combo.
[207:21.78]Oh, battle maul and slab.
[207:24.42]I see.
[207:24.74]Alright, cool.
[207:32.05]Keep it on.
[207:33.67]Alright, fun.
[207:37.49]You guys want to go for a three?
[207:39.82]Oh, baby, a triple.
[207:43.58]Let's do three.
[207:45.06]Wait a minute.
[207:46.34]Hold on.
[207:47.48]I could probably upgrade that shield and mace.
[207:52.70]Because it's a green, I could probably turn it into a blue.
[207:55.44]There's low-intensity zones?
[207:59.03]There's a low-intensity three.
[208:01.25]Low-intensity three.
[208:03.03]With Grimoires.
[208:04.09]Oh, that's perfect.
[208:04.67]Let's do that.
[208:06.25]I think it means there's more...
[208:09.75]Wait, do you need time to upgrade, Jerma?
[208:11.15]Or are you good?
[208:11.91]I'll probably try it just to make sure I like it.
[208:14.36]Okay.
[208:15.92]Oh, my bad.
[208:16.98]No, it says expect.
[208:22.04]It's like... Yeah, low intensity, I think, means more specials, less hordes.
[208:29.36]I don't know why it's called low intensity.
[208:32.15]Or maybe it's less rewards because of the modifier?
[208:34.27]I don't know.
[208:36.02]It had a line at the end, and I read it three times, but I'm like... Not to compare to another game too much, but the way Deep Rock kind of does the level complexity in addition to the difficulty level, maybe?
[208:50.97]Maybe that's what it is.
[208:52.87]How many certain types of enemies spawn.
[208:57.01]I'm going to put on my charge gun.
[208:59.39]I guess there's not really the random generation.
[209:03.11]This one's an infiltration mission.
[209:09.86]I'm considering buying the game but I don't have a squad of people to play with would I be okay just playing by myself yeah I mean I've been playing it a little bit off like solo and
[209:29.87]Yeah, level one and two is good to start learning in solo queues.
[209:31.79]Three and up until you get leveled up a bit more.
[209:34.46]You probably don't want to queue in two.
[209:35.96]Also because...
[209:50.09]Right now, I don't think there's any restriction.
[209:51.75]Like, you can be, like, level 3 and queue into a tier 3.
[209:53.68]Yeah, you can queue into, like, anything.
[209:56.70]Everyone will be, like, mad at you, and then you'll die.
[209:58.90]And that's not very fun.
[209:59.96]Yeah, it seems like... Because I think the reason why playing solo in some of the other games, maybe, is...
[210:13.26]There's no bots, right?
[210:15.59]You just queue up with people?
[210:17.79]Yeah.
[210:18.03]It'll fill in bots if somebody leaves the mission.
[210:20.49]But then it'll refill them like usually with another person.
[210:23.83]Can you start a game with bots?
[210:26.68]I don't know.
[210:27.08]I think it'll try to matchmake.
[210:29.26]I think the bots are only there if there's no one that happens to be matchmaking at your current difficulty level.
[210:33.69]I think you can start it with bots, but then if people join in progress, they'll just take over and you can't really stop them.
[210:39.63]They definitely have bots in the game, so it's possible they could change that later.
[210:43.75]There's a Sniper over there.
[210:49.78]Right.
[210:50.24]Wasn't it?
[210:53.08]Oh, that's fun.
[210:55.38]Are you liking the shield?
[210:56.28]Yeah.
[210:58.63]I think that's the first big upgrade for you.
[211:01.09]Yeah, he can attack with it.
[211:02.83]I think it eats stamina when it gets hit.
[211:17.52]You also have a thing, though, where you can deploy it, like put it on the ground.
[211:21.05]Yeah.
[211:21.67]I wonder how you do that.
[211:23.33]And it blocks infinitely.
[211:24.23]It might be the alternate attack or alternate move.
[211:27.09]Oh, yep.
[211:27.91]You can test it if you want.
[211:30.45]But it's really fun if you, like, put it in a... There you go.
[211:34.61]Like that.
[211:34.97]So now we all get to shoot around you.
[211:37.89]Really?
[211:38.78]Yeah.
[211:39.66]they won't like oh this will block everything whoa that's cool so if we like get to a doorway and you just drop that just go boom then everybody can just play yeah that's fun I let my friends play yeah yeah I give me way less responsibility so I can just like enjoy you guys like beating stuff I mean I think it's pretty like necessary in the higher difficulties to have an auger because like sniper
[212:09.92]You become the oh, yeah choke point sniper really Sniper, huh?
[212:19.04]He's never gonna stop holding the shield up now Oh, what's that a fire person
[212:36.04]Yeah, I don't think you can block fire.
[212:54.19]So bad.
[212:54.71]I'll make a loss so bad.
[212:55.91]Whatever.
[212:56.51]Whatever.
[212:59.12]Yeah, but he never even himself playing this.
[213:05.43]There's two of them.
[213:06.89]Oh, there's another one.
[213:08.19]Okay.
[213:12.67]I hear whispers.
[213:15.60]There's a spooky light up ahead.
[213:18.44]You know what?
[213:19.90]This is the first time.
[213:20.82]Let's not alert it.
[213:22.12]I believe in you guys.
[213:23.38]Alright.
[213:24.85]World's first.
[213:26.75]World's first.
[213:27.99]World premiere.
[213:30.77]The Darktide gang doesn't alert the demon host.
[213:35.17]Sorry, no voices.
[213:39.14]I'm so sorry.
[213:39.76]Please don't kick.
[213:41.70]I typed in slash.
[213:42.60]We go around.
[213:51.18]Who is shooting this?
[213:52.04]Oh, there's a lot of people with guns.
[213:53.16]Yeah, just get down here so we can avoid the... I think the witch or whatever is up there.
[213:58.62]Oh!
[213:59.48]It's a demon host, not a witch.
[214:01.60]You're thinking of Left 4 Dead.
[214:03.62]Don't let it happen again.
[214:06.18]Only referring to it in the most positive light.
[214:09.14]We good?
[214:09.96]Let's keep going.
[214:11.22]Machine gunner shooting.
[214:12.40]I'm blocking all the bullets.
[214:13.80]You're a king.
[214:16.12]Yeah, but we're going the other way, right?
[214:18.33]No?
[214:18.93]Okay.
[214:22.98]Actually, it's a demon.
[214:23.92]Oh, I hear it Sing buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzzing That's how it there is unsuspecting folks in the love these they go wait Did I shoot it I might have it's cackling just don't Don't shoot it.
[214:40.69]Don't shoot it as you shoot it No, we're good.
[214:42.75]We're good.
[214:43.81]We're good.
[214:44.89]Yeah, we're good.
[214:46.99]We're good.
[214:47.25]Yeah, we're just keep keep fleeing I
[214:51.79]Which way do we go up here?
[214:53.09]Further upstairs, right?
[214:53.93]Keep going.
[214:54.47]All the way up.
[214:55.09]Further up.
[214:56.59]Okay.
[214:57.11]Everyone to the top of the stairs.
[214:58.49]I love this part.
[215:00.27]You love this part?
[215:04.02]What does that mean?
[215:06.46]This part where it goes... Okay.
[215:17.34]Oh, man.
[215:17.70]Those guys take a lot of health.
[215:19.06]There's a fucking hole.
[215:20.32]I fell down a hole.
[215:21.90]Oh my god.
[215:23.04]I've got a hole too.
[215:25.02]Oh!
[215:25.82]Oh my goodness, where's all my friends?
[215:27.42]Where's all my friends?
[215:29.24]We're good here.
[215:31.60]The whole board hurt our comms.
[215:33.10]Should I move?
[215:33.80]Ow!
[215:33.90]They're trying to get by.
[215:35.52]They're trying to squish me.
[215:38.70]Okay, you can attack now.
[215:41.37]I'm down behind you.
[215:54.99]The shield seems to be working for you.
[215:56.24]It was.
[215:56.86]Definitely held up there.
[215:57.72]There were just too many in this tiny room.
[215:59.38]I can go up here, I think, right?
[216:03.56]That actually was pretty cool.
[216:06.82]We avoided it, actually, so congrats.
[216:09.26]Woo-hoo!
[216:10.42]Judgment comes.
[216:17.57]Nice.
[216:18.47]Anyone need that ammo?
[216:21.21]I think everyone's okay.
[216:23.39]Oh, okay.
[216:25.73]Alright.
[216:25.99]We got a heal for you, Josh.
[216:28.06]Good for all of us.
[216:30.28]Might as well just take it.
[216:31.90]Going in.
[216:38.50]Behind us, behind us, behind us, behind us.
[216:40.86]Holy shit.
[216:41.76]Drop down, drop down, drop down.
[216:43.72]If you get stuck up there, you're going to die.
[216:45.66]Yeah, get down here.
[216:46.98]Okay.
[216:47.28]Alright, we're good now.
[216:50.42]Yeah, that's still going to shoot us from above.
[216:53.70]Yeah, but I got guns.
[216:55.78]Get behind me.
[216:57.24]I'm dying.
[216:58.84]I'm dying.
[216:59.56]Oh, shoot.
[217:00.90]Come down.
[217:01.77]We did not drop down.
[217:04.01]Oh, you dropped down all the way.
[217:06.03]Yeah.
[217:06.95]Yeah.
[217:22.76]His mouth is moving more than he's speaking.
[217:25.26]What?
[217:26.16]Can you please stop calling attention to that?
[217:28.20]I'm kind of insecure about it.
[217:32.21]You really pointed that out in front of a lot of people.
[217:34.65]Alright, I got the setup here.
[217:36.17]Let me know where you want me to place it.
[217:38.11]I'm thinking about right here.
[217:39.25]Check that out.
[217:40.03]Get behind it.
[217:43.10]We're gonna need to do the hacking thing, so... Yeah, we'll have to move around a little bit.
[217:51.82]Alright, I'll get it.
[217:56.98]Oops!
[217:57.24]Got it, okay.
[218:23.27]I like using the shield as a weapon.
[218:29.47]I think Strippen's build with that same Ogryn shield is you can get an enchant on your mace so that whenever you hit with it, it gives you 14 toughness back like your shield.
[218:42.12]Oh.
[218:42.94]So you can like actually tank really well.
[218:46.88]I actually really like this chainsword.
[218:51.37]Nice.
[218:51.73]I thought it was gonna, like, take ammo or something.
[218:56.43]Wait till you get the power sword.
[218:57.65]That's apparently the best weapon in the game.
[219:00.59]Oh, shit!
[219:01.47]Oh, shit!
[219:02.23]Oh, shit!
[219:04.17]Oh, shit!
[219:05.09]Oh, shit!
[219:05.49]That was a bad move.
[219:06.23]You're good.
[219:06.49]You're good.
[219:12.52]I got it.
[219:21.80]Wait, what?
[219:24.14]Yeah, the timing's a little funky on that sometimes.
[219:26.16]What?
[219:26.30]There you go.
[219:32.71]It robbed me.
[219:33.63]Ooh, careful.
[219:34.79]Gunners.
[219:43.04]Dog.
[219:43.70]Dog.
[219:52.93]Alright, good.
[219:55.85]Is chainsword only for veteran?
[219:58.57]We get a double two-handed chainsword as Zealot.
[220:03.24]And we also get a chain axe, but I don't know about single hand.
[220:09.10]So far so good.
[220:10.60]Yeah.
[220:10.90]You know, we're just warming up at the beginning of the stream.
[220:15.26]Yeah, well, I don't understand.
[220:17.68]Well, I know you understand.
[220:18.68]You didn't even have the shield.
[220:20.76]You weren't even a real player.
[220:22.37]No, we had our comedy time and now it's our gaming time.
[220:26.43]Oh, it's one of the books.
[220:28.92]Ooh, I'll get him.
[220:33.48]Hell yeah.
[220:33.82]There's ammo there if you want.
[220:35.30]Yeah, I'll take it.
[220:36.22]Do not read it.
[220:36.84]Do not look in that book.
[220:49.34]You idiot.
[220:50.56]What are you thinking?
[220:51.38]Oh, watch it.
[220:58.90]Did I get hit by that even though I was the one that shot it and I told you about it?
[221:01.85]That's pretty good.
[221:16.62]Let's go.
[221:19.32]Oh, it is.
[221:20.20]Where?
[221:21.21]Behind us.
[221:22.19]Behind me.
[221:27.29]Behind.
[221:29.39]Get behind me.
[221:32.65]There we go.
[221:32.93]Fire.
[221:35.00]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[221:36.42]I forgot.
[221:37.00]Good call.
[221:37.22]Actually, the burster.
[221:38.46]Burster.
[221:47.74]Oh, my gun is way too inaccurate.
[221:49.52]I can't hit him from that far away.
[222:02.85]Elementary school level acting.
[222:04.89]Elementary school play level acting?
[222:08.33]Is that better or worse than Ubisoft E3 acting?
[222:12.80]I know that's what I mean.
[222:15.28]Is that about the voice I did?
[222:17.53]I don't know.
[222:18.45]Somebody was very rude.
[222:19.61]Who is being insulted so that we can appropriately be upset and engaged?
[222:23.43]True.
[222:24.35]Yeah.
[222:25.41]I'm just going to assume it was me, so I feel bad for myself.
[222:27.23]That's cool.
[222:27.51]I'm going to assume it was me.
[222:28.81]I'm also going to feel bad.
[222:30.21]I think it was me, so I'm going to feel bad, too.
[222:31.75]Alright.
[222:33.51]Sounds like a plan.
[222:35.51]By the way, I definitely feel way more bad than you guys do.
[222:38.67]No, I think I feel worse.
[222:40.32]No, I don't think so.
[222:41.12]Yeah, you should.
[222:43.66]No, I feel awful about it.
[222:44.70]I feel the worst.
[222:47.37]You go up the ladder.
[222:50.12]It's definitely up here.
[222:53.38]Up here?
[222:58.75]Alright.
[222:59.49]Yeah, 100%.
[222:59.73]What?
[223:00.25]You just took fall damage, and you were making a joke to make me come up here, and you were the one that got hurt.
[223:04.15]I didn't.
[223:05.84]I heard your guy go, when he landed.
[223:10.12]It's in character that my guy does like theater level acting.
[223:13.91]Alright.
[223:16.75]Josh probably get the ceiling.
[223:26.72]The thought is actually kind of funny of like a middle school play being put on, and it's just like a Ubisoft E3 trailer reveal.
[223:32.20]Oh, what's that?
[223:34.50]Oh, boy.
[223:35.16]Get me back in here.
[223:36.02]Get back in here.
[223:40.99]Oh, God.
[223:41.31]Trapper.
[223:41.97]Oh, that was close.
[223:45.91]Can't shoot through that.
[223:47.95]That was bad acting.
[223:49.81]You're right.
[223:50.49]What I just did was bad.
[223:51.93]Hey, blood.
[223:52.35]Can't shoot through this.
[223:53.36]Hey, friends.
[223:54.42]Get behind me.
[223:55.34]I agree.
[223:56.66]Did we need ammo?
[223:57.40]I have some.
[224:01.20]You ever going to stream without the wig on?
[224:05.79]Uh, no.
[224:21.07]That's one of those big scary things.
[224:23.08]Yes, it is.
[224:24.16]Whoa!
[224:24.84]Big scary thing over here.
[224:25.72]Why the Emperor?
[224:27.85]What is that?
[224:47.22]Oh, you guys actually did 50% of its health and damage in the time it takes this gun to reload.
[224:55.57]Thought I was going to help.
[225:03.77]Kill the target.
[225:05.27]Oh, this is the boss one.
[225:08.25]I like these ones.
[225:08.83]These ones are fun.
[225:13.48]It was Paul Bearer.
[225:16.92]Oh, the Undertaker.
[225:18.34]Destroy him.
[225:20.98]I love Paul Bearer, dude.
[225:22.19]He's an inspiration.
[225:25.63]He really is.
[225:26.19]Oh, there's a health station here.
[225:31.83]Oh, dog.
[225:33.34]Oh, shit.
[225:35.16]Bad dog.
[225:36.92]Oh boy.
[225:39.49]We got two large shield lads.
[225:49.99]That's what I got this big fucking thing for!
[225:52.23]I got one of those too!
[226:02.58]Show them the hand dryer servitor.
[226:04.02]I think I did before.
[226:04.82]You guys seen the hand dryer servitor?
[226:07.71]Did someone use the thing twice?
[226:09.03]No, we need a battery for this one.
[226:10.23]We need to find a battery for it.
[226:13.47]Hey, look.
[226:14.25]Star, you like lore stuff?
[226:15.27]Look at this.
[226:16.41]Oh, it is a hand dryer servitor.
[226:17.61]Wow.
[226:17.93]It's a servitor that's been turned into a hand dryer.
[226:19.93]It is the destiny of mankind to conquer this troubled galaxy.
[226:23.84]Can you imagine?
[226:24.60]Are they alive?
[226:26.74]Sometimes.
[226:27.40]They're still sentient.
[226:30.14]They just have to watch people pee all day and then... Oh, my God.
[226:33.26]I wish more things in here were servitors.
[226:39.28]I mean, every door, every toaster, every radio.
[226:43.33]Oh, the Emperor!
[226:44.87]There we go.
[226:49.04]Oh.
[227:05.52]These stairs go up.
[227:06.32]Mm-hmm.
[227:07.16]These stairs.
[227:08.40]Oh, I guess they just call out where you're supposed to go.
[227:14.40]Aww.
[227:15.10]He was yelling help.
[227:16.12]Yeah.
[227:16.60]Why'd we kill that guy?
[227:17.90]Ah, he was infected.
[227:19.74]He looked at me weird.
[227:25.98]Oh, I think the last Grim's over here.
[227:27.29]Aye.
[227:28.73]We're feeling a little spicy.
[227:31.27]Ah, this is an opportunity for me to really shine here.
[227:52.99]What's up, buddy?
[227:53.75]I saw you running over here.
[227:55.43]What are you going to do about that?
[227:57.21]Hey, buddy, where do you think we're going?
[227:59.18]Me and my friends got a couple of loot we're trying to grab.
[228:04.99]Hey Smush, you want to pick this up?
[228:06.49]What is it?
[228:06.99]It's the last Grimoire.
[228:09.09]Line?
[228:09.37]Someone said, hey, I'm watching this in 720p, just letting you know.
[228:15.08]What the, what the fuck, dude?
[228:19.18]Seven, come on.
[228:21.00]Uh, maybe we should use the ammo now.
[228:22.62]Oh, do you want me to do it?
[228:23.69]Yeah, let's use the ammo now.

[229:00.73]Yeah, a lot of gunners.
[229:02.63]Get behind me.
[229:03.11]Get behind me.
[229:04.11]Behind!
[229:04.43]I already dropped down.
[229:07.09]Get behind me.
[229:08.07]Behind me.
[229:08.85]Big guy, but it's okay.
[229:10.03]Alright.
[229:10.33]I'm going to try to keep him off your back.
[229:15.03]Stay behind the shield.
[229:15.74]A lot of motherfuckers.
[229:20.24]Watch out for these motherfuckers.
[229:22.34]Did you just...
[229:35.41]Oh my goodness, I'm coming.
[229:38.17]Gotta be honest, I need a Medicaid.
[229:42.05]Got one coming up.
[229:42.85]Is it?
[229:44.71]That's the song that goes like, and they're whispering something.
[229:50.89]Yeah, it's my favorite song.
[229:57.45]Alright, Medicaid is going to be up here.
[230:00.51]Chat is spicy tonight.
[230:01.78]That's alright.
[230:03.02]We're just having fun.
[230:09.45]Wow, you did not take well to dying.
[230:11.19]Alright, we're at the boss.
[230:17.03]Medicaid is right here.
[230:20.80]Yeah, I need health.
[230:24.30]So do these books do anything besides you just have to take a slot up?
[230:28.24]uh yes if you look at the purple that's currently re going um it's gonna be permanent purple on us based on the grims we have so half of our health is just gone by default and you get extra rewards for picking these up right yes more money more experience all of it cool
[230:49.03]Alright.
[230:49.89]So for that medical thing, if you want to put it on the boss, like halfway through the fight, then we can just regen while on him.
[230:56.27]And then that will be easy peasy.
[230:59.50]My voice is ear piercing.
[231:01.10]It's so awful.
[231:02.08]What?
[231:05.34]I'm reading a question and I don't understand it.
[231:08.29]Well, I don't know if it was a question.
[231:14.59]I was just getting my Jerma impression down for the future.
[231:16.67]It's like adding that one to the repertoire.
[231:24.33]Fox Burster.
[231:25.67]That's going to be a problem.
[231:29.04]He hit me.
[231:29.68]Alright.
[231:29.94]Come on.
[231:33.68]Come on.
[231:37.50]Come on!
[231:37.76]Reload the gun!
[231:38.74]Oh, you're dead dead.
[232:08.02]If you guys want to go get Ster, I'll be in the box.
[232:10.88]Four seconds.
[232:11.36]He'll be up.
[232:15.37]I'm up.
[232:15.91]On this side of the room.
[232:18.03]Oh, there he is.
[232:18.49]Okay.
[232:18.75]I'll try and go get to him.
[232:20.23]But I'm very low on health, too.
[232:22.37]Ooh.
[232:26.23]Don't you dare.
[232:27.47]No guards on you?
[232:28.15]Okay, cool.
[232:33.28]Oh.
[232:35.56]Don't you dare do that.
[232:40.95]Oh, did we drop?
[232:41.49]Did the medical thing drop?
[232:43.31]Yeah.
[232:50.99]Alright, one more, one more.
[232:53.31]We got this.
[232:53.83]Come on.

[233:16.48]Well done, boys.
[233:23.44]What is that?
[233:24.14]Oh my goodness.
[233:25.12]Careful.
[233:25.76]Secondary boss.
[233:28.66]Okay.
[233:30.74]That was epic.
[233:36.34]The game is available on Steam right now.

[234:15.73]Am I?
[234:16.27]I do like the single shot thing.
[234:18.83]I'm a single shotter.
[234:20.07]It is.
[234:21.59]It is, you say.
[234:22.85]Yeah.
[234:25.79]It is.
[234:26.17]Basically, you're firing explosive Red Bull cans at people.
[234:31.66]Red Bull cans?
[234:33.00]Yeah.
[234:34.04]Okay.
[234:34.28]Let's see if I can get one.
[234:36.84]You guys good for another one?
[234:37.92]Good for one more?
[234:38.38]I can do one more.
[234:39.76]Sure.
[234:40.44]I'll be playing all night, I think.
[234:41.42]Good either way.
[234:43.21]yeah yeah I have to uh I have to just get out of here uh pretty soon I gotta go over get ready to fly an airplane oh yeah you are doing that tomorrow should be pretty interesting oh there's another cutscene oh yeah watch it
[235:03.52]How familiar are you with the concept of flying?
[235:06.92]I mean, I've played Microsoft Flight Simulator because it was free on Game Pass.
[235:14.39]I played it for like 10 minutes.
[235:15.39]I'll be good then.
[235:16.33]We'll see.
[235:17.37]The seniors have their eye on you.
[235:34.41]Plus, it pays extra.
[235:38.63]You did a five terabyte install to play for 10 minutes.
[235:43.27]That's actually, that's actually kind of true.
[235:48.44]You should memorize something really specific to impress Austin.
[235:52.58]Yeah, don't worry.
[235:53.28]I'm going to make sure I go in there with a bunch of language and lingo.
[235:56.84]I'm going to know.
[235:57.22]Don't worry.
[235:59.19]Oh, it was an emperor's gift.
[236:00.09]I did get a bolt gun.
[236:02.27]Cool.
[236:02.55]Sick.
[236:05.17]And it's actually really freaking good.
[236:07.01]Thank you, Emperor.
[236:07.97]Praise be.
[236:09.61]Praise be.
[236:10.05]Praise be.
[236:10.45]Did I get anything new?
[236:12.22]I got this a while ago.
[236:20.34]Okay.
[236:22.10]I'm going to spend my gamble currency.
[236:23.68]Uh-oh.
[236:25.02]You're going to gamble?
[236:26.26]Give me a new knife.
[236:29.22]Oh my god.
[236:29.80]It's another axe.
[236:30.57]I'm going to fucking cry.
[236:33.19]Give me a new knife.
[236:35.67]Oh my god, it's another fucking axe!
[236:37.97]Every time.
[236:39.43]I literally rolled 12 times with this, and it's only been axes.
[236:43.25]And it's my least favorite weapon.
[236:44.97]I think that's a sign from the Emperor.
[236:47.39]He wants you to use the axe.
[236:48.82]I will not.
[236:49.52]I hate it.
[236:53.06]I didn't even look.
[236:54.18]And the weapon that I really wanted was available, and I didn't even look.
[237:01.90]So, uh, Curios, do those just, uh...
[237:05.35]Those just appear at random?
[237:07.39]Or can you buy those too?
[237:09.12]You can buy them.
[237:09.58]I think I have the slot, but I don't have any yet.
[237:14.26]I'm ready.
[237:17.14]I'm going to hold on to this.
[237:18.24]Yeah, hold on to everything.
[237:22.09]Okay.
[237:25.01]So what do you want to do for one more with this particular group?
[237:27.81]And by all means, if you guys keep playing, keep playing.
[237:31.85]Hmm.
[237:34.82]One more chill zone one or two?
[237:36.06]No, let's do a three.
[237:38.74]Yeah, you know what?
[237:39.58]Let's go.
[237:42.04]High intensity engagement zone.
[237:45.22]Or... Nah, fuck that.
[237:47.03]We'll do this one.
[237:52.43]This one's got a good ending.
[237:53.53]I'm really close to some drops.
[237:56.77]Yeah, good.
[237:57.36]You'll get it.
[237:57.94]This is going to take definitely more than 15-20 minutes.
[238:05.32]Go for a four.
[238:06.12]I don't think we're ready for a four.
[238:08.58]Yeah, I don't know.
[238:11.27]I mean, we could try, but it would be getting destroyed.
[238:14.59]I mean, do you want to go out on a four and just see how badly we get just absolutely decimated?
[238:19.67]Let's try it.
[238:19.99]Depends if you want to finish or not.
[238:21.54]Too late.
[238:22.20]Alright.
[238:22.88]Well, we're good.
[238:23.28]Let's do what we know we'll do.
[238:30.51]I think a 4 would be hard for an 11 and an 8.
[238:33.07]I think you'd need at least a 15 to 20.
[238:36.87]Yeah, I'm trying on a new outfit.
[238:42.19]I think I look pretty good.
[238:44.82]Wait, are you using pajamas and a little hat?
[238:49.51]It's unfortunate that the, you know, it is like a prison necklace.
[238:52.79]I want it to be an ascot, but maybe when I get to level 30 and they free me.
[238:56.94]I was going to say it looks like an ascot, so it plays, you know?
[239:01.04]Yeah, I think I look good in it for it being actual prisoner armor, like attire.
[239:06.22]I think I pull it off.
[239:08.51]Yeah, you definitely pull it off.
[239:10.39]I just realized something really, really important.
[239:14.47]People have not been able to see how much ammo I've had the entire stream.
[239:21.50]I mean, it's not like they're playing.
[239:22.64]Oh, dude.
[239:24.16]These are insane.
[239:25.86]Shut up.
[239:26.84]Like, you haven't done that before.
[239:28.42]Stop.
[239:28.72]Oh, dude.
[239:29.14]They couldn't even see.
[239:30.30]Yeah.
[239:31.73]They couldn't even tell.
[239:32.95]How can they follow the action?
[239:35.87]You did that a month ago.
[239:37.07]I saw it.
[239:37.67]Shut up.
[239:38.17]Like, you've never done that before.
[239:40.43]Bro.
[239:40.59]Whatever.
[239:51.21]Come on, focus up, focus up.
[239:52.19]Forget about the ammo.
[239:53.61]Oh, I gotta try a bolt gun.
[239:54.89]Yeah, what?
[239:56.23]It doesn't... Okay.
[240:08.54]Do you know what the special ability on the sword is?
[240:11.02]Is it like a parry?
[240:12.48]Yeah.
[240:12.92]Yeah, okay.
[240:14.44]It uses some stamina when you hit back when you block.
[240:18.09]That'd be such an awful way to go.
[240:21.29]Just four people just smashing you, just smushing your head with different like big blunt objects and swords and stuff.
[240:37.61]Holy shit, this gun is insane.
[240:39.75]Behind me, behind, behind, behind, behind, behind.
[240:51.07]That kind of makes me feel bad.
[240:52.49]Like, how am I going to use other guns?
[240:53.93]Yeah, once you start using the bolter, it's... The reason I don't use it is it's just so slow.
[241:00.04]Like, load and get set up that... I like the slow guns.
[241:04.02]The other guns were slower.
[241:05.86]Compared to the plasma gun, this thing like AOE explodes.
[241:10.50]I would get behind me.
[241:13.61]I come out like turkey.
[241:20.64]Jeez.
[241:22.34]Those feel a little inaccurate.
[241:23.64]There's a lot.
[241:24.27]Oh my god, stay behind me.
[241:25.31]Oh, dog.
[241:30.29]Oh my dog.
[241:31.29]They did it again.
[241:31.97]Where's this fucking dog?
[241:34.83]He jumped up.
[241:35.97]Oh.
[241:36.17]Did he fly?
[241:39.25]Kind of.
[241:43.71]That guy's just screaming, wait.
[241:47.54]Maybe.
[241:50.01]I mean, I would feel that way too.
[241:51.53]I'd just turn around and see these fucking guys running towards me with a knife.
[241:54.53]I think I might get like a really good... I don't know.
[242:09.31]Never mind.
[242:11.79]Uh-oh.
[242:17.61]Trapped.
[242:20.39]What the hell?
[242:30.56]Oh, I am dead.
[242:33.52]I went from 100 to 0.
[242:34.20]That is so many.
[242:44.69]I might just not have enough damage at this level, but I don't know.
[242:48.31]It's hard to tell.
[242:50.89]We're good.
[242:52.01]I'm good, yeah.
[242:52.69]Hey, the armored guys.
[242:53.95]What's the strategy on the fully armored guys?
[242:56.92]Just dodge primarily because they wind up.
[243:01.62]I just found out you can't really dodge backwards because it goes in a line.
[243:07.49]Yeah.
[243:07.99]Yeah, I keep having that problem.
[243:09.13]Yeah.
[243:09.85]is there a particular weak point on those guys too or not not their heads weirdly enough I always dodge backwards and I get hit every time my problem is like yeah I go to shooting head but it's good uh good to know yeah they're all armored but their head is the most armored apparently um they're kind of a bastard but I have like a bleed build so I just hit them a few times and they get stacks and die anyway so
[243:42.65]Or bolters we're fucking up to.
[243:44.51]Bolters are like huge ammo piercing.
[243:49.95]Is the chainsword good for armor or bad for armor?
[243:54.38]It's good if you rev it.
[243:55.64]Otherwise... What the fuck just happened?
[243:58.26]I gotta stop swearing.
[244:00.58]When you rev it, it does a big ammo... arrow... armor piercing?
[244:04.77]Armor piercing.
[244:17.06]This... It is a grimoire.
[244:19.48]Look, it's like in the fucking... It's inside the thingy.
[244:26.35]That's weird.
[244:26.97]Do you think this is cool or hot?
[244:30.03]This?
[244:30.37]This is probably minty fresh.
[244:31.37]I'm thinking like spearmint.
[244:32.73]Chili?
[244:33.03]Do you think it's like 50 degrees, 60 degrees?
[244:35.73]Yeah, it makes it like a numbing sensation.
[244:38.71]That's what I'm imagining.
[244:39.36]I think it's the gas form of Nickelodeon Gak.
[244:43.26]Ooh.
[244:43.54]Ooh.
[244:47.18]I wonder what that would be like heated up to the point that it's gaseous.
[244:52.24]Yo, it heals you.
[244:53.78]Oh shit.
[244:55.50]So when Katy Perry got like a face full that one time.
[244:59.39]The uh... Do you guys remember Floam?
[245:03.15]No.
[245:03.97]Floam was... Where is that?
[245:05.29]Floam was way better than Gak.
[245:07.57]Everyone's like, oh Gak!
[245:09.85]Remember Gak?
[245:10.30]Gak was dog shit, okay?
[245:11.78]Floam was way better.
[245:18.07]I think it's a sniper.
[245:21.05]It had little beads in it.
[245:22.89]It was this squishy... It's hard to describe.
[245:26.78]You ever had Dippin' Dots?
[245:27.94]Yeah.
[245:33.78]There's another heal up here.
[245:37.71]There's a station up here with one more in it.
[245:41.67]Well, we can't climb back up there.
[245:43.31]Oh.
[245:45.20]Never mind.
[245:45.70]Yeah, we also, our purple is from the Grim War.
[245:47.80]It's not from damage.
[245:50.12]Ah, right, right, right, right, right.
[245:53.00]Oh, Grimmy.
[245:54.24]Oh, Grimmy.
[245:55.30]Here they come.
[246:07.85]Remember, uh... Astronaut ice cream?
[246:11.41]I do.
[246:11.75]It's awful.
[246:12.91]Oh, yeah.
[246:13.25]Actually, I had it once.
[246:15.24]Terrible.
[246:16.86]Was there, like... I remember as a kid, I was confused if I was allowed to have it.
[246:20.78]Because it was like, I'm not an astronaut.
[246:23.04]Oh, you're not allowed?
[246:23.96]Yeah.
[246:24.20]I don't know why they were giving us it.
[246:29.99]Shit, trap.
[246:31.35]Every gift store had them for some reason.
[246:37.51]Astronauts hate this.
[246:38.77]It's weird.
[246:39.28]Wanna buy some?
[246:40.82]It's weird.
[246:41.34]No one actually likes it.
[246:43.28]You just keep spinning me around.
[246:44.70]I'm trying to pick you up.
[246:47.58]Get up.
[246:51.82]There's a big guy right behind you.
[246:57.09]Alright, time to get up.
[246:58.65]Thank you!
[246:58.85]Elevator is almost here.
[247:00.73]Dog.
[247:00.83]Woof!
[247:00.93]Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof...
[247:13.00]Is someone playing Lúcio?
[247:17.00]Lúcio? Oh that's an Overwatch joke.
[247:31.51]Guns.
[247:32.43]Oh.
[247:34.15]Okay.
[247:36.89]Everyone in the elevator.
[247:37.91]No.
[247:38.67]Okay, fair enough.
[247:45.58]Ah, I am in the elevator.
[247:46.60]Oh, I spawned up here, actually.
[247:47.66]Wait, where are you?
[247:50.86]I respawned right up here.
[247:51.98]Oh, shit, you did.
[247:52.70]He's got me.
[247:53.16]He's got me.
[247:53.54]Brian Griffin.
[247:54.24]Yep.
[247:54.72]That's Brian Griffin.
[247:56.84]Yep.
[248:18.74]He can't stop himself from making Family Guy noises.
[248:22.02]We, I mean, we were doing that earlier a little.
[248:27.27]Yeah, everyone do your best Family Guy.
[248:29.49]Ready?
[248:30.61]Was your excuse that also... He can't stop himself.
[248:34.31]Oh, well, I mean, to be fair, we also did it earlier.
[248:36.98]Yeah, that does... It's kind of double downing on the can't stop yourself thing.
[248:43.52]Well, no, I'm saying, like, I... Alright, I'll take the L. Stay behind me, please.
[248:50.24]Stay behind me, please.
[248:53.81]Alright, well, they're all dead Guy got hit and like the fucking cheek with the grenade.
[249:02.88]I'm the only guy back here.
[249:04.04]Oh
[249:09.86]That is a sniper, I believe.
[249:11.82]Is it?
[249:12.02]I don't know.
[249:12.92]Let me see.
[249:14.04]Wait.
[249:14.24]Wait, wait, wait.
[249:14.66]Can I get it?
[249:15.06]Oh, it was right in the head from like 100 miles away.
[249:19.06]Oh, you hit him?
[249:19.90]Mm-hmm.
[249:20.78]Nice.
[249:23.34]Oh, this part.
[249:24.23]Oh, he's trapped.
[249:29.55]Oh, come on.
[249:32.79]Oh.
[249:38.32]I'm beating the shit out of this guy.
[249:40.94]Thank you.
[249:42.18]Sorry that took so long.
[249:44.20]I don't know if I like this bolt gun.
[249:46.78]You don't like the bolt gun?
[249:48.10]I don't think I like it.
[249:50.92]Oh.
[249:53.34]That's a big raid.
[249:54.92]What is Stu's type?
[249:56.56]3,000 people.
[249:57.42]Nah, I forget what it was called.
[249:59.54]The Hellbore Lasgun?
[250:01.66]I think.
[250:02.14]I really like that still.
[250:03.96]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[250:05.40]Yeah, the charge up rifle.
[250:07.34]I've never tried it.
[250:08.09]Thank you, Fillion, for the raid.
[250:09.37]Thanks.
[250:09.61]Appreciate it.
[250:12.15]What's up?
[250:12.51]Thanks.
[250:12.77]Welcome, everybody.
[250:13.29]I'm actually the revolver.
[250:15.19]Yeah, thanks for the raid, bro.
[250:17.99]Hey, what's up?
[250:19.59]We're playing some Darktide.
[250:20.83]You can buy it now on Steam, by the way.
[250:24.16]It is available.
[250:28.54]What?
[250:29.14]I swear to God, they're glued to me.
[250:36.14]Yeah, I don't know what you were streaming, Fillion, but I hope you had a good one.
[250:40.41]We're having a good time over here.
[250:42.63]That's right, Jerma.
[250:43.85]We're killing it in Darktide.
[250:45.35]Behind me.
[250:47.43]Behind me.
[250:48.77]You really should get behind me because there is a big machine gun person.
[250:56.24]I'm done here.
[250:59.50]I'm running around him.
[251:02.46]Is he dead?
[251:02.92]There's like three guys behind you hitting you.
[251:06.54]Oh shit.
[251:09.58]Wait, was I just getting like... Like the back of my head?
[251:14.82]You were 100% getting... 100%.
[251:21.06]Oh, that's why my health is so low.
[251:24.42]Oh, isn't it better if I take the hits and not sing a raid song?
[251:28.41]We don't do raid songs anymore.
[251:29.99]This is like, it's not 2018.
[251:32.06]Can we do a raid song?
[251:33.80]No, because they will never stop asking.
[251:35.67]And anytime I raid somebody, they will just make that person sing a raid song.
[251:40.87]I had no idea what it was in reference to.
[251:42.93]I thought it was a World of Warcraft thing.
[251:47.34]You know what?
[251:47.76]I should have let you believe that and asked you to do one.
[251:51.12]I wouldn't have known one.
[251:52.20]I wanted you to do one so I could learn.
[251:53.72]Behind!
[251:54.04]Oof, oof.
[251:55.76]Ah, oof.
[251:56.26]Behind!
[251:56.72]Behind me!
[251:57.70]Behind you!
[252:00.20]Yep.
[252:00.78]Oh, what the hell?
[252:01.72]You're right.
[252:02.56]Behind you.
[252:03.16]There was a fucking mutant.
[252:09.50]Oh, a big gunner behind you.
[252:11.00]Oh, that's bad.
[252:11.62]Uh-oh.
[252:17.89]Get in this little area here behind me.
[252:20.05]Yep, the alcove here.
[252:25.05]I'm telling you, get behind me.
[252:26.47]I'm behind you.
[252:28.55]Everyone, enter the alcove.
[252:31.62]Fine, I'll sing the raid song.
[252:33.40]Thanks!
[252:36.56]Nice work.
[252:42.77]And then, did you brofist the camera?
[252:48.01]Uh, I need this.
[252:58.38]Thanks and a brofist?
[252:59.42]That's right.
[252:59.88]That's what we do here.
[253:06.90]I think that guy just died.
[253:08.33]No, this person really.
[253:11.59]Hammer guy.
[253:12.83]Where?
[253:13.71]Coming up right next to you.
[253:16.01]Oh, my God.
[253:19.01]I dreamt them.
[253:21.85]Oh, I dropped down to you.
[253:29.68]I am almost out of ammo.
[253:35.75]Do we drop ammo?
[253:37.65]Do we have any ammo?
[253:38.87]There's ammo over here.
[253:42.79]Yeah, ammo right there.
[253:49.32]Stop making squeak sounds.
[253:57.18]Oh, that's a lot of motherfuckers down here.
[254:05.72]Oh, I got trapped.
[254:09.63]He's going to smash me.
[254:12.45]I'm sorry, man.
[254:13.47]I can't help you.
[254:16.93]No, are you serious?
[254:19.85]Do you see what's going on over here?
[254:22.78]Look at the movie theater screen.
[254:24.98]That's what you can see.
[254:26.30]I got it.
[254:27.00]I got it.
[254:27.56]I got it.
[254:28.08]I'm good.
[254:28.32]I'm good.
[254:40.56]Oh shit!
[254:39.20]Oh shit!
[254:42.60]Come on Criken!
[254:44.00]Criken! Criken! Criken! Criken! Criken! Criken!
[254:50.35]Come on Ster! I'm coming!
[254:56.07]Dude use your melee weapon! What are you doing?
[254:57.55]Dude I can't I have to defend otherwise I'm gonna lose.
[255:00.81]You gain toughness when you swing your weapon!
[255:03.81]You don't know that.
[255:13.67]I'm down.
[255:22.58]It's alright.
[255:23.30]I think you're alright.
[255:24.16]I think you because there's no big scary things is that there's that one guy with the green pods on his back.
[255:27.98]That's it.
[255:43.03]Alright.
[255:43.89]Good job.
[255:45.99]Are we safe?
[255:47.63]We have a few guys on us.
[255:49.29]Just be careful when we get here.
[255:55.70]We got it.
[255:57.02]We got it.
[255:57.98]We got it.
[256:00.10]Wait.
[256:00.26]Did you... I think we were behind you guys.
[256:02.86]I think you're up here.
[256:03.54]I think you guys are up.
[256:04.24]I think we're ahead.
[256:05.42]Yeah.
[256:05.80]We're ahead.
[256:06.36]We have one of those green sword guys next to us.
[256:09.76]Shoot.
[256:23.13]Why can I not pick you up?
[256:24.59]Where is it?
[256:25.03]Right here?
[256:25.61]I got him.
[256:27.84]Every time.
[256:28.30]He also doesn't ever throw you.
[256:31.60]He just fucking wails on you.
[256:33.42]Yeah, he just shoves me.
[256:43.87]Behind.
[256:50.71]Two large lads on me.
[256:51.77]Yep.
[256:53.21]Oh, no.
[257:01.20]What happened over there?
[257:02.68]I don't know.
[257:03.36]I'm having a tantrum.
[257:08.15]Okay.
[257:10.49]Miku's in chat right now.
[257:12.52]Hatsune Miku's no shit.
[257:15.00]I'm a huge fan.
[257:19.99]Thank you.
[257:29.83]You know what to do, boys.
[257:30.97]Oh, yeah.
[257:39.70]Yeah, boys.
[257:45.14]Oh my god.
[257:51.57]They were all... You know what?
[257:52.57]I think they were stuck.
[257:53.35]I don't think they could move.
[257:57.19]I think... You're right.
[258:04.40]Alright, we're almost at healing.
[258:06.62]Miku's in chat.
[258:07.34]Miku's here.
[258:07.84]Really?
[258:09.28]What should I...
[258:14.30]What?
[258:14.62]Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[258:23.66]Okie doke.
[258:24.10]Let's prime the goober.
[258:33.78]Oh, this part.
[258:43.36]I hear him.
[258:43.90]I almost just walked in.
[258:44.84]Anybody need ammo?
[258:47.21]I need about half.
[258:50.25]I got an ammo box if we need it eventually here.
[258:52.39]I'll throw it down.
[258:53.31]We'll do it after these phases maybe.
[258:55.81]Yeah, after the first phase.
[258:56.71]And don't fall in the lava.
[258:58.75]Yeah, we can have that.
[259:08.36]Oh, right.
[259:08.80]All the growing stuff.
[259:22.75]It's still happening.
[259:25.31]How?
[259:25.53]Why?
[259:28.01]Die!
[259:31.11]I won't let you burn my friends!
[259:38.76]Up behind you, Smush!
[259:42.24]Oh, it's while you stand still.
[259:44.06]Who stands still?
[259:49.70]Two different Grenaders.
[259:50.65]Oh my God!
[259:58.75]We're separated.
[260:00.11]Yeah.
[260:00.51]Meet you at the next one.
[260:08.86]Goodbye.
[260:16.84]Wow.
[260:17.20]This is a totally great perk.
[260:19.85]Flamer.
[260:22.81]Got him.
[260:29.63]Okie doke.
[260:31.68]One more.
[260:32.48]After this horde.
[260:59.54]Wait, I can throw this underhand?
[261:04.78]Yeah, someone just blew my mind with that as well.
[261:07.98]Why would you do it underhand?
[261:10.13]Like if they're slow serve, but I don't know.
[261:13.05]It doesn't really feel useful.
[261:16.61]Well, I'm always throwing grenades and I'm jumping into piles.
[261:21.75]Also, I'm pressing the button and it's not doing anything.
[261:23.58]Watch out.
[261:25.72]Holy shit.
[261:26.48]Well, I knew it was going to hit me.
[261:29.82]Yeah, it was really brave.
[261:32.22]Oh, that's healing over there, isn't it?
[261:35.65]I would love some of that.
[261:36.63]Is that healing?
[261:38.23]Oh, that is healing.
[261:38.93]I'm going to put the ammo down here, too.
[261:42.50]Yeah.
[261:51.40]Alright, go.
[261:53.86]It's rocking load, rocking, locking load.
[261:59.01]We got another raid.
[261:59.81]Holy shit.
[262:00.35]Yeah, there's so many of them.
[262:17.98]Hold on.
[262:18.26]Hold on, I have like three brain cells.
[262:19.98]I have, sorry, hold on.
[262:24.93]Oh, there's too many and I'm supposed to be the tank and I'm not doing my job!
[262:27.37]You're good, you're good, just get over to this side.
[262:31.31]Oh, you fell off.
[262:32.61]Ha!
[262:35.91]Ah, there's Rush!
[262:38.83]Do the rage song, no!
[262:40.39]I have fallen down, I have fallen down.
[262:42.35]Thanks for the raid, I appreciate you.
[262:44.85]Thanks for coming and having some fun.
[262:48.20]I'll go down too, shoot.
[262:52.88]Did we lose?
[262:54.32]We're about to.
[262:54.78]We're good.
[262:55.17]We're going to survive.
[262:56.21]He threw this stun grenade.
[262:58.22]Which is actually doing really good.
[262:59.84]Oh.
[263:00.48]Yes.
[263:01.04]Nice.
[263:01.80]Did it.
[263:02.18]We're good.
[263:02.46]We're good.
[263:02.68]We're good.
[263:03.14]I fell.
[263:03.66]I fell.
[263:04.30]Ow.
[263:04.90]I fell and I can't get up.
[263:06.44]I'll try and cover you.
[263:07.96]Oh, my arms look good.
[263:11.92]Alright.
[263:13.40]Do you want to get smushed?
[263:16.43]No, we're not getting smushed.
[263:18.05]Goodbye, smush.
[263:18.59]No, just leave me.
[263:19.23]Just leave me.
[263:19.79]You don't actually get any minuses for not getting everyone out.
[263:24.19]Oh, okay.
[263:24.79]So smush is canonically left here.
[263:26.93]I mean, I guess, yeah, we're not valuable enough to reward saving us.
[263:32.55]Oops.
[263:34.99]Oh, my God, my screen.
[263:45.86]But that was.
[263:46.40]Sorry, it's like there's so many sounds in my head right now.
[263:51.61]Uh, Lane of... Lane of Lazar.
[263:55.09]Lane of Lazar.
[263:56.51]Appreciate it.
[263:57.41]Thank you for the raid.
[264:02.24]Thank you.
[264:02.72]Yeah.
[264:03.24]Yeah, thank you for the raid.
[264:04.92]Welcome, everybody.
[264:08.52]There we go.
[264:11.28]Two raids back to back.
[264:12.10]Let's go.
[264:14.53]That was 20 minutes ago?
[264:15.59]Oh.
[264:16.99]I was... There was a lock on wrong.
[264:25.85]Yes.
[264:26.61]You're dead in canon.
[264:27.68]You don't get any experience.
[264:29.52]You're dead.
[264:33.14]I'll be in the book.
[264:33.72]Nice job.
[264:39.48]Nice job.
[264:40.68]What a moment.
[264:59.20]I missed the motive.
[265:01.70]Not the motive.
[265:03.20]The notive.
[265:03.74]Are you drunk?
[265:05.06]No, it's just there's music playing in both my ears and I can't talk when it happens.
[265:10.86]What music?
[265:12.62]All the soundtrack.
[265:16.59]I get speech jammed when there's sounds going in both ears.
[265:19.91]That's talked about many times.
[265:23.79]This game is very overwhelming when everything's rushing at you.
[265:31.85]That's really cute.
[265:37.14]Like funny little quirk.
[265:41.40]Oh boy, right?
[265:42.66]Check the store.
[265:43.66]See if you get anything cool.
[265:45.14]That's right.
[265:51.83]What's new?
[265:53.41]Anything good?
[265:54.68]Oh, shit.
[265:55.18]There's a fucking 300 power diaper.
[265:57.70]Oh.
[265:59.50]Oh.
[266:01.12]Blessed.
[266:01.64]Unsoilable.
[266:02.54]I'm so mad that was on camera.
[266:06.48]Completed.
[266:07.62]And I'm taking this too.
[266:08.50]Are you shitting me?
[266:11.26]In this diaper, yeah.
[266:17.23]I can finally get a curio.
[266:18.33]Oh, yeah.
[266:22.77]That's so much better.
[266:25.56]Man, I hate it when I hear things with both my ears at the same time.
[266:29.44]You know, for all the shit talkers out there, I'm just telling you, when I have both of my ears blocked, it doesn't matter what it is, if I cannot hear myself talking completely without any filter on it, it causes, it just makes, it's like muffled and it's weird and I can't talk correctly.
[266:50.59]I have to be able to hear myself talk.
[266:52.29]I have to be able to hear the ambience of the room.
[266:56.99]I've known you for a long time and I can confirm you do need to hear yourself talk.
[267:08.88]I reached through the monitor and strangled him.
[267:16.18]That was pretty good.
[267:17.38]That was pretty good.
[267:19.46]I'll let you have that one.
[267:20.86]Okay.
[267:22.00]I have officially been allowed to have one.
[267:28.86]Do you know what the like the primary action and secondary action numbers mean on like a gun like on a laser gun?
[267:37.02]I'm so roasted.
[267:37.72]I don't know to do anymore Primary action
[267:44.34]is I think like hip fire and then secondary is like aiming down the sights trying to figure out like the numbers are pure damage or what they are yeah for the okay for the knife for example light attack is a slash for my dagger and a heavy attack is is pierce and it's a heavy that's the heavy attack okay
[268:02.81]think yeah so crowd control means what exactly so the shield has 40 this one out 47 percent crowd control is that how far back you knock them back when you push them what is crowd control
[268:28.60]okay um so it's when it's knockback so it's how much knockback it is okay that's cool I need an opinion from Criken sure oh there we go it shows on when you inspect it'll show a crowd before level 30 or like really high item gear is it a total waste to use any of my cubes or like the requisition stuff
[268:54.44]I would save the cubes for 30.
[268:58.62]Yeah.
[269:00.16]But I would use the... Oh, no, Walt.
[269:03.29]What's the other stuff?
[269:04.47]The requisition man.
[269:06.99]You can use the, like, the little Pringles can-looking things.
[269:11.53]Yeah, but not the cubes.
[269:13.05]I would save the cubes.
[269:16.06]Yeah, Jerma's right there on that screen you were on.
[269:17.94]It shows crowd control and defensive and, like, kind of describes what...
[269:22.68]So you can actually go look at all the details of the weapon.
[269:28.82]Like this 80s.
[269:29.84]Did you guys know this?
[269:33.37]That's a lot more info than I realized.
[269:35.31]I don't think that was in the beta, was it?
[269:37.13]This is a full breakdown of literally every single aspect of this whole weapon.
[269:41.83]Damage and stagger.
[269:43.19]Heavy attacks.
[269:44.97]Special actions.
[269:45.71]I crashed the game.
[269:46.45]Oops.
[269:46.57]No.
[269:51.57]That's really cool, though.
[269:52.73]Well, it's perfect timing.
[269:53.83]Too much knowledge, profane.
[269:56.63]Too much info.
[269:58.31]I guess that's one way to get out of trying a level four.
[270:08.54]You want to try a level four?
[270:09.34]Ooh, you want to try a level four?
[270:11.64]Yeah?
[270:13.50]yeah yeah yeah yeah sure okay my confidence is growing my confidence is growing I think we can do it look at I'm growing my confidence level level four can we do level four let's freaking do it do it we'll do it oh but I don't know if I have enough time I don't what if we're not good enough what if we can't do it well if we can't do it then you'll die early what if I don't have enough damage then you just use your big shield if I say something stupid people don't think it's funny
[270:41.93]Oh, I can't help with that.
[270:43.91]What if you guys never talk to me again?
[270:46.73]Wasn't planning on it.
[270:47.64]What if... What if nobody likes me?
[270:53.02]What if... Oh, I went to the meat grinder and it kicked me from the group.
[270:57.21]Let's see if I can rejoin.
[271:02.03]Do you guys really want to go for it?
[271:05.06]Yeah, let's go for it.
[271:07.86]We might not survive an entire round, but we can definitely try.
[271:11.48]It shouldn't take long.
[271:13.04]No, it's going to take probably five minutes.
[271:14.14]We'll find out one way or the other really quickly.
[271:16.16]Let's get back in the game.
[271:26.99]Another moment?
[271:28.15]What's going on?
[271:29.23]People are making moments here?
[271:35.27]Can anybody in chat make a moment, or does it have to be a mod?
[271:37.73]Just the mods, I think.
[271:40.21]You get five a month, so you might as well use them, right?
[271:42.21]Might as well.
[271:42.59]You only get five moments a month?
[271:45.63]What if you had more moments?
[271:49.91]I thought I used them all for the year or something.
[271:51.81]Didn't I make... Use all the ones that month in one stream.
[271:56.06]The longest stream or whatever.
[271:57.44]If you have more than five moments in a month, they're not really moments.
[272:00.28]They're not special enough.
[272:02.26]Oh, we had like 30 moments.
[272:03.46]No, you didn't.
[272:06.50]Yeah, I noticed that there's not.
[272:07.42]I only had one moment from your stream this last couple months.
[272:09.80]I don't know.
[272:12.40]Did it very much happen?
[272:13.44]I don't know.
[272:16.16]It's out of notification.
[272:16.82]We have one new moment from Ster's channel.
[272:18.48]I was just like, oh.
[272:19.34]I don't think I've ever made a moment.
[272:21.80]In a while.
[272:23.54]And I'm sorry that I burned you so bad earlier.
[272:25.96]I apologize.
[272:27.79]I know you're trying to get back.
[272:32.37]I'm trying to get back in here.
[272:33.63]I'm trying to get back in.
[272:39.43]What do you got going on, Ster?
[272:41.77]I have going on.
[272:42.81]What do you got going on?
[272:45.83]Well.
[272:47.46]My life is totally derailed.
[272:52.86]I just have Myriad is all I have.
[272:54.80]It's the only thing in my life.
[272:56.30]What is Myriad?
[272:57.08]I have nothing else.
[272:58.42]What is Myriad?
[272:59.49]Myriad is my tabletop game that Criken played in a while ago.
[273:02.85]And it takes a lot of work to make and stuff.
[273:06.39]So not much has been going on because it is the holiday times and all of my players are doing other things.
[273:13.00]And where can they find this game?
[273:16.02]Myriad's tabletop streams on my channel on twitch.tv/stirr.
[273:21.49]Is that stair like the star?
[273:23.66]With an E. S-T-E-R.
[273:25.34]So like stair.
[273:26.18]That's pretty cool.
[273:28.04]Why do people pronounce that stair?
[273:30.22]Why does an E suddenly get an A noise?
[273:33.39]Well, it's star with an E at the end, right?
[273:35.09]No, no.
[273:35.71]S-T-E-R.
[273:41.09]Not S-T-A-R-E.
[273:43.72]Do we want me to make the party?
[273:44.70]Do you want to throw some invites around?
[273:46.16]Yeah, I had to relog because I went to the meat grinder like a fool.
[273:48.76]So you can make the party again.
[273:51.80]I will just throw out invites.
[273:53.06]Are we all in the game?
[273:53.68]Yeah, I'm still in.
[273:57.70]Do I need to leave the existing party?
[274:00.78]Probably, I would say.
[274:02.16]Yeah, leave strike team.
[274:03.63]Okay.
[274:10.03]There's the old smush.
[274:11.83]There you are.
[274:15.67]I can invite you here and then Ster.
[274:21.25]Alright.
[274:23.39]Let's try a level four.
[274:24.13]Let's see what happens.
[274:25.25]Alright.
[274:25.55]That's what I like to hear.
[274:27.31]Our options are... That one's pretty straightforward.
[274:34.26]Well, it's the only four, so I guess that's what we're doing.
[274:36.24]That's the one we're doing.
[274:36.82]Alright.
[274:41.56]So if we're going to lose in literally five minutes,
[274:46.30]It's always an option.
[274:47.00]Criken, what do you got going on?
[274:50.52]Honestly, I've just been playing a lot of Darktide, a lot of... What else have I been playing?
[274:57.53]I played WoW in the expansion launch.
[275:00.18]Oh yeah, Dragonflight.
[275:00.94]I saw one of my friends playing that.
[275:02.52]Is it any good?
[275:03.37]Looks actually entertaining.
[275:04.65]I'm not even a WoW player.
[275:05.95]Yeah, it's been the most fun I've had with the launch of WoW since, like, for many years.
[275:11.29]The thing that I was surprised was how fast the dragons fly.
[275:15.68]Kind of like an action experience in that game.
[275:18.48]It feels like the first expansion where Blizzard values the player's time, which is saying something.
[275:23.90]So it doesn't feel like you're made to...
[275:27.35]Do a really repetitive shit over and over again every single day to stay, you know... Did you like Legion?
[275:35.05]Yeah.
[275:35.59]I think Legion's my favorite.
[275:36.63]I think that's the best state of the game it was ever in.
[275:38.89]So this is honestly, this feels like the most like Legion since... Really?
[275:42.65]Yeah.
[275:43.55]In terms of just like what the start of the expansion feels like.
[275:47.53]Really?
[275:47.83]Okay.
[275:49.23]Do not like half-lice is bad.
[275:56.09]You can put two headphones in for this.
[275:58.55]Oh boy, two headphones?
[276:00.75]How are you gonna hear yourself?
[276:01.79]That's how you know we're getting serious.
[276:04.65]Alright.
[276:14.84]Godspeed, everyone.
[276:18.52]You'll notice things take a little bit longer to kill.
[276:21.10]We just have a lot more health.
[276:24.07]And we don't have more ammo.
[276:26.25]Do we?
[276:27.21]No, we don't.
[276:29.25]If anything, we might have less ammo.
[276:30.81]I think I know why this gun has so much higher damage.
[276:33.52]It's slower firing, but it might be better.
[276:51.18]Oh, that would be horrible.
[277:02.88]Ranger!
[277:05.48]Alright.
[277:22.96]Why is it being so weird?
[277:25.62]What did I do?
[277:33.97]Where is this guy going?
[277:34.79]He just walked into the fire.
[277:51.54]it's this guy I walked right by him he's hiding in there he's always a weird person I mean am I always weird I don't think it's always
[278:24.96]Holy shit.
[278:26.81]You know what to do.
[278:31.39]There are so... There are... That's more people than I've ever seen in this whole game.
[278:44.42]Holy shit.
[278:45.80]I couldn't stop that guy.
[278:47.72]I couldn't stop that guy.
[278:52.27]Oh my god!
[279:00.81]What the fuck?
[279:05.60]Get out of my way!
[279:06.68]Dude, we can't even fit in this.
[279:16.20]I just spit all over my computer.
[279:20.53]They can't even... Dude, what the fuck?
[279:27.33]Doing fine.
[279:28.51]There's a gunner in here with us now.
[279:30.43]Alright, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[279:33.77]That big guy in the corner alive or dead?
[279:35.89]Okay.
[279:36.79]That's turbo.
[279:38.61]No, there's one in the corner looking at the wall.
[279:45.32]That guy, this gunner.
[279:48.14]They're on the stairs too.
[279:54.56]Alright, I'm going in.
[279:55.76]Yeah.
[280:02.20]We survived.
[280:05.53]I'm actually really surprised we lived through that.
[280:08.23]Yeah, it's just like you just gotta coordinate a lot better.
[280:10.71]I haven't been paying attention at all.
[280:12.69]I forgot we did a four and I've been like talking to my chat and just like and then I saw that like the doorway jam.
[280:21.16]So, does it increase the amount of enemies per tier?
[280:24.13]Uh, yes.
[280:27.45]I mean, the answer has to be yes.
[280:29.65]There's no way.
[280:31.97]There's no fucking way.
[280:38.07]Yeah, it makes endless horde, I think, as the default for core.
[280:44.27]And then all similar specials.
[280:46.99]So... And everyone's got more health.
[280:53.76]This is unbelievable.
[280:57.64]It starts to feel like a different game.
[280:58.98]Once you get good at it, you don't want to play anything lower.
[281:04.28]Yeah, I feel like you end up... No, it's okay.
[281:06.02]Oh, boy.
[281:24.99]What?
[281:26.51]I even have the perk that I'm less likely to be attacked.
[281:31.39]Oh, really?
[281:32.81]I mean, I'm standing still, but all the way in the back.
[281:40.67]I guess I did shoot him a lot.
[281:45.83]I don't know.
[281:57.47]Dude.
[281:59.59]Dude.
[282:06.19]Alright, let's go.
[282:08.13]Dude, I think we're doing okay.
[282:11.52]I think we're doing alright.
[282:12.80]The next area is usually pretty hard.
[282:16.04]We might have to all back into a corner.
[282:18.60]We have healing coming up.
[282:21.58]Technically, we can wait to heal until after the next horde in case we want to save it.
[282:42.31]I... I don't... Why am I getting targeted?
[282:48.69]Oh, wait.
[282:48.85]I think I even turned that off.
[282:50.15]Never mind.
[282:50.97]What'd you do?
[282:53.12]Um... I died.
[282:54.30]Oh, that's... I thought that was you.
[282:56.22]I died and I blame the game.
[282:58.28]It's alright.
[283:01.06]We'll get you.
[283:01.42]Did I take a health?
[283:05.87]Oh, I probably did.
[283:07.43]Holy shit.
[283:08.25]Somebody's doing a lot of damage.
[283:09.41]They're going down.
[283:11.77]Oh, they hit very hard.
[283:14.45]Oh, it's a sniper.
[283:17.77]It's a sniper.
[283:19.26]I can get him.
[283:20.80]He keeps shooting me in the fucking head.
[283:27.06]Oh, what the hell?
[283:28.38]Dude, he's executing you.
[283:29.54]Got him.
[283:30.14]Oh, it's going to be close.
[283:32.58]Okay.
[283:37.90]No, shit!
[283:41.72]Oh my god, I have no more!
[283:51.25]I have no more help!
[283:52.11]I have no more help!
[283:52.77]I have no more help!
[283:53.89]Wait, there's a healing station right here.
[284:00.07]We're good.
[284:01.13]We're good.
[284:01.63]We're fine.
[284:02.59]Okay.
[284:02.95]They're up there.
[284:03.61]Should I use it now?
[284:05.79]Yeah.
[284:05.97]I'm using it now.
[284:07.09]Alright.
[284:07.35]Let's go get them.
[284:11.27]There are a lot of gunners defending us.
[284:14.08]Good to know.
[284:14.60]Like three machine gunners.
[284:16.26]I'm just snitching.
[284:23.42]Alright.
[284:24.72]Let's not hit it yet.
[284:25.58]We're just going to try to get them up first.
[284:29.26]Yeah.
[284:29.50]That's a good idea.
[284:35.18]They do take a lot of hits now.
[284:39.52]One gunner got away.
[284:43.68]Yeah.
[284:44.26]Thanks, bro.
[284:44.66]Alright.
[284:46.76]We're good.
[284:47.01]Alright.
[284:47.89]Thank you.
[284:49.69]Alright.
[284:49.97]Let's save the other two healing for after this.
[284:52.81]I have a heal kit thing.
[284:55.07]Do you want me to put it down now?
[284:56.97]Let's wait until a little bit into the fight.
[284:59.19]And that way we can use it in case we get driven off.
[285:05.93]Nice.
[285:09.00]Dog!
[285:14.04]Do I shoot through Jerma if he's like in between?
[285:17.18]Yeah, there's no friendly fire so.
[285:19.23]I just wasn't sure if my bullets would go through.
[285:23.44]We have to make it clean.
[285:25.34]Exit.
[285:25.66]I have an ammo box if we need to as well.
[285:29.62]Alright.
[285:30.62]Let's activate it.
[285:32.66]Usually, I think if Jerma's here with a shield guarding the front, because a lot of gunners usually come from the front, and then we watch the sides of his back.
[285:40.45]Alright.
[285:41.15]Shield up.
[285:42.39]You guys snipe the gunners.
[285:45.25]I'll watch the melee and you guys... Dog.
[285:47.67]He's gone.
[285:50.01]He's gone.
[285:50.44]Just keep blocking.
[286:00.04]they're approaching vampires they're approaching music
[286:25.61]They're coming from our right.
[286:26.81]Okay.
[286:28.03]You take over melee.
[286:28.65]I'll take the right.
[286:31.95]On the left, on the left.
[286:34.13]On the left.
[286:40.48]Oop, more gunners.
[286:44.10]Gunners, up!
[286:46.32]Thought.
[286:46.90]Uh, maybe not.
[286:47.40]Oh, yeah, they're there.
[286:49.84]On our left again.
[286:50.70]Left and right.
[286:51.90]Where?
[286:52.18]What's going on?
[286:57.76]I got grabbed.
[286:58.90]I got grabbed.
[287:00.58]Nice.
[287:03.03]Alright.
[287:12.11]We got through the thing.
[287:17.59]I'm dead.
[287:17.93]I'm dead.
[287:19.19]I am also dead, unfortunately.
[287:21.14]What the heck?
[287:22.10]What did I do?
[287:23.32]What did I just do?
[287:27.08]Oh, shit.
[287:28.20]My knife just barely nicked an explosive thing and it literally threw me to my death.
[287:35.14]That's it.
[287:35.58]Well, it just takes one oopsie.
[287:37.97]Oh, that was... I got surrounded by ragers.
[287:42.37]That was incredibly unlucky.
[287:45.37]We literally would have had it if I didn't blow myself up.
[287:50.14]No, I mean, we... I mean, we made it further than I thought.
[287:51.84]Yeah.
[287:52.26]I thought we were going to die in the first 10 seconds.
[287:53.86]Yeah, I think we could do it if, you know, like, practice.
[287:55.68]I think we'd easily be able to get it.
[287:57.14]Practice makes perfect.
[287:57.84]So, we're going to get an okay amount of experience.
[287:59.88]Yeah.
[288:00.04]We actually got level 10 out of that, so... That's not bad.
[288:05.25]Oh, yeah.
[288:05.63]And, again, I think 10 is a pretty big power boost, generally.
[288:09.07]Yeah.
[288:09.31]Look at all the money we just got.
[288:11.23]So, that is a lot of money for failing.
[288:13.37]Ooh.
[288:13.83]Headhunter auto gun.
[288:16.01]So, auto guns versus lase guns.
[288:17.60]What do you think is better for the Ranger?
[288:20.88]Blaze Guns for taking out elite targets.
[288:23.20]Autoguns for Horde, probably.
[288:25.47]Toughness on the cleave beat helps a lot with tanking.
[288:28.99]Good to know.
[288:30.73]Well, alright, that was fun.
[288:32.43]Yeah, thank you.
[288:33.41]That was fun, yeah.
[288:34.63]Thanks for playing, everybody.
[288:35.41]See you guys all probably soon.
[288:38.45]I mean, I think the game's really fun.
[288:42.30]Maybe I'll keep playing it if you guys are still playing.
[288:45.94]You know it.
[288:46.40]I'll probably level a new character and then I will... Yeah, I want to try one of the other characters.
[288:52.19]I actually do want to try the, uh, the Psyker, or whatever it is.
[288:55.37]Yeah, that's, that's my next one, too.
[289:00.13]Yeah, I feel like a lot of people are saying, oh, that, that's my second character.
[289:03.67]There's gonna be a shitload of those running around in the next, like, few weeks.
[289:07.01]Yeah.
[289:09.25]I think, I mean, the Ogryn looks, looks fun, too.
[289:11.49]It is, it is.
[289:11.97]Big guy.
[289:13.33]Yeah, Ogryn's fun.
[289:15.61]Alright, guys, I'll, uh, imagining some of you guys probably gonna keep going.
[289:19.42]If not, then we'll, uh, I'll talk to you guys soon.
[289:21.16]Thanks for playing.
[289:22.78]Yeah.
[289:23.46]Sorry about the early confusion with the party set up.
[289:28.46]I sent too many invitations out.
[289:31.58]Yeah, I did that actually.
[289:33.56]I goofed.
[289:34.90]Blame me.
[289:35.93]Well, no, I wouldn't say that.
[289:38.01]No, please, please.
[289:39.15]I like get off on it.
[289:40.01]Alright, see you.
[289:41.55]Bye.
[289:48.33]Thank you, Warhammer.
[289:50.46]for sponsoring the stream.
[289:52.56]I really appreciate it.
[289:54.74]That was a lot of fun.
[289:55.78]Game's really fun.
[289:56.42]Game's great.
[289:58.96]Looks like it's going to continue to be supported.
[290:01.90]Warhammer, big, huge shout out.
[290:05.18]Go grab it on Steam if you like what you saw.
[290:06.96]It was fun.
[290:08.92]It's on Steam.
[290:12.20]And is it on any other platform right now?
[290:15.29]Let's see.
[290:25.05]So is it on Xbox?
[290:28.29]Oh, it is on Xbox.
[290:29.32]Oh, it's coming to Xbox, maybe.
[290:32.20]Well, all I know is it is on Steam.
[290:34.44]It's $40.
[290:35.86]Seems like there's quite a lot of content, so... I'm very happy with that.
[290:42.73]I'm very happy with getting sponsored, too, so that's really cool.
[290:45.89]Thanks, guys, for watching.
[290:46.61]That's going to be it.
[290:47.29]I will see you guys...
[290:51.47]I'll see you guys tomorrow on Austin's channel.
[290:54.29]Austin Show.
[290:55.65]I'll be flying a plane, which is going to be very interesting, so I'll see you tomorrow.
[291:00.95]Good night.
[291:01.37]Goodbye.
[291:02.13]Follow Austin's channel.
[291:04.05]There's no such thing as a host anymore on Twitch, so, you know, we'll just make sure that it's in the chat here.
[291:07.92]I'll see you soon.
[291:13.36]Thanks for sticking around.
[291:14.80]Thanks for the raids, too, if you were here from one of the raids.
[291:16.28]There was a couple of big raids that came in.
[291:18.74]Thanks to those of you that decided to raid this channel.
[291:22.38]Appreciate it.
[291:24.50]See you guys tomorrow.
[291:36.99]Don't really know what to expect, but I'm sure we'll find out.
[291:43.81]Yeah, the time.
[291:44.43]When is it starting?
[291:45.51]That's a good question.
[291:48.29]I know Austin tweeted about it.
[291:49.83]What time tomorrow is it starting?
[292:01.34]Is that for 4 p.m.
[292:02.24]Eastern?
[292:02.80]Okay.
[292:05.52]4 p.m.
[292:05.72]Eastern.
[292:05.98]Alright.
[292:06.76]So that would be 1 p.m.
[292:09.27]Pacific.
[292:15.29]Call your mother.
[292:16.07]See you later.
[292:16.47]Take care of yourselves.
[292:20.11]Goodbye.
[292:20.51]Ta-ta.
[293:41.49]you
[294:16.37]Thank you.
[294:45.73]Sorry, I didn't want to talk too loud because I know people don't expect it, but I just got called out so hard and I have to just explain.
[294:52.93]Somebody said, Omega Lull, that manual Plexus music change.
[294:58.63]I don't know how you could tell I did that.
[295:00.95]They're like, ah, that manual drag the volume slider down.
[295:09.73]How did you even know?
[295:10.49]I don't know how you knew I did that.
[295:16.30]I slowly grabbed it and was just like, let's go really, really quietly, slowly to the left.
[295:27.28]Was it that obvious?
[295:28.34]Is it though?
[295:28.88]Alright, whatever.
[295:29.60]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[295:32.33]Take care of yourself, Susan.
[295:33.35]Bye.
