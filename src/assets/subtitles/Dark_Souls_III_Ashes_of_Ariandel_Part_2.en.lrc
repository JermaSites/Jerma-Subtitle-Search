[01:10.68]Oh shit, I accidentally pressed the stream button.
[01:14.04]Oh no.
[01:14.60]I wasn't supposed to do that.
[01:19.03]Oh crap.
[01:21.61]Whoops.
[01:22.99]What's going on guys?
[01:28.56]Give me a second.
[01:30.92]One second.
[01:43.37]No, I just felt like turning it on.
[01:45.05]It's going to be short.
[01:46.49]Probably, I would assume, less than an hour or two.
[01:52.87]Just going to play Dark Souls.
[01:54.17]Just walk around and kill things while I hang out and talk.
[01:57.74]And thanks to your bud Chili for the subscription.
[02:00.24]Welcome, dude.
[02:02.42]Facecam?
[02:03.08]No.
[02:05.22]R.I.P.
[02:05.80]No, no.
[02:06.38]This is just going to be... We're going to hang out for like an hour.
[02:10.01]I know it is way past my bedtime.
[02:13.84]Thanks, Mittens, for the two months.
[02:16.82]Mittens9898.
[02:17.38]Oh my god, and then we've got GrimHers.
[02:25.05]Thank you, Grim, for two months.
[02:27.45]Welcome back.
[02:30.05]Alright, let's hope that Dark Souls 3 is not out of sync like it was last time, the whole stream.
[02:38.50]Also, thanks for your subscription there, dude.
[02:41.00]WagonFire.
[02:42.10]Wait, what?
[02:43.74]And ScoutGirl1 for seven months.
[02:45.64]Welcome back, you two.
[02:49.09]Hi, guys.
[02:49.69]I'm playing on my caster.
[02:56.33]This guy is pretty much 100% sorcery.
[02:58.03]Let's hope everything doesn't screw up.
[03:04.90]That should take us out of here.
[03:06.20]Hey, lookit.
[03:09.64]So my guy here is Mr. Caster.
[03:14.47]And pretty much only use sorceries.
[03:19.15]Depending on the situation.
[03:22.86]Great music.
[03:23.72]Extremely handsome.
[03:24.70]Innovative decks.
[03:26.84]Innovative decks.
[03:29.74]Hey, a wizard for 12 months.
[03:30.86]The skeleton you tucked in was the boatman.
[03:34.34]The air serpent stole his skin.
[03:36.22]Mod me.
[03:39.66]Thanks for the 12 months, dude.
[03:41.04]First of all.
[03:42.44]And second of all.
[03:43.80]Holy shit.
[03:47.02]Thanks, Shadowboats, for two months.
[03:48.24]Thanks.
[03:49.74]Melodic Mane for your new sub.
[03:52.74]Is this out of sync?
[03:56.24]When I swing and hit the ground.
[03:57.94]Like, is the audio out of sync?
[03:59.87]It shouldn't be.
[04:00.35]I just tested it.
[04:02.15]I can't even tell you why it was the first time.
[04:10.03]Like, when I smash into the wall.
[04:17.18]No, it's not.
[04:17.84]So what... So what the hell was happening the last time I streamed this game?
[04:23.48]Yeah.
[04:24.64]Legitimately, I swear to God, guys.
[04:26.46]I didn't change any settings.
[04:29.08]Nothing happened.
[04:29.62]I didn't do any OBS updates.
[04:31.64]Nothing happened.
[04:33.02]It just was out of sync for no reason.
[04:36.58]Well, okay.
[04:38.63]Stop bothering me.
[04:39.41]I'm trying to sleep.
[04:40.99]Well, thanks, Adidas footwear.
[04:43.11]Perfect.
[04:43.53]Okay, I don't... That doesn't make any sense to me.
[04:46.09]At all.
[04:47.29]What the hell was the last thing I was doing?
[04:50.63]That is a question.
[04:51.61]Oh, actually, wait a minute.
[04:52.26]I think I remember.
[04:54.14]I do think I remember.
[04:56.75]I believe I was going up this way.
[05:01.75]I was about to sleep.
[05:02.51]Yeah, this is just... We're just gonna chill.
[05:05.67]Nothing intense.
[05:07.23]I'm playing sorcery Dark Souls guy.
[05:10.96]And I'm asking for the game to not be intense.
[05:14.70]Pretty sure I just need to run by all this.
[05:16.10]I have, like, all these skips, I think.
[05:18.70]If I can remember.
[05:19.90]If my brain's that good at remembering things.
[05:26.96]I don't plan on being like, whoa, what the fuck?
[05:31.10]Just going to chill.
[05:32.08]There's a guy behind me.
[05:33.00]Might as well take care of him, right?
[05:38.16]Whoa!
[05:41.41]Yeah, I'm a magic wolverine guy.
[05:44.73]These are infused with a magic gem.
[05:46.71]And then I cast a lot of spells.
[05:51.19]I think I'm going the right way.
[05:54.89]Dark Souls is one of those fine games where you don't play it for a day or two, you kind of forget what the hell you were doing.
[06:00.55]No, I think this is the... Okay, I was trying to kill the freaky dude down here.
[06:07.72]Yeah.
[06:10.84]Scary, scary man.
[06:13.88]Who, as a sorcerer, probably is going to be pretty hard.
[06:15.86]Oh, I'll just... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:19.61]Oh my god, I'm already dead.
[06:24.87]Well, that's a good start.
[06:27.63]That's a fine start to the evening.
[06:35.29]And actually, that is not the way I wanted to go.
[06:37.71]Hold on a minute here, guys.
[06:40.41]That is not the way I wanted to go.
[06:44.61]I wanted to go straight.
[06:50.01]Yeah, I wanted to go this way.
[06:52.37]Forget about that guy.
[06:54.01]We're going this way.
[06:54.55]This is the actual way I wanted to go.
[06:55.99]Because this takes me to... I'm at just a bunch of bosses.
[07:03.23]I'm at a bunch of bosses that I can't really beat as this guy.
[07:06.20]So maybe if any of you guys want to play, maybe we'll just play co-op.
[07:10.16]I'll just pull some random people that I want to play in.
[07:12.68]Because these guys as Mr. Spellcaster are not the funnest thing.
[07:16.14]Oh my god, I forgot how ugly this guy was.
[07:23.03]This guy has, like, a melted candle for a face.
[07:28.23]I'll give this guy a run just, uh, for fun.
[07:34.89]See what boss souls you have.
[07:35.95]I already- I break them every time I get them.
[07:37.49]Alright, let's see.
[07:42.41]Can I... Oh, mistake.
[07:56.68]That's so far so good.
[08:01.74]I say that too soon.
[08:10.60]Ooh, I got it.
[08:12.30]No, I didn't.
[08:13.38]Shit.
[08:19.69]What?
[08:19.89]I didn't dodge that?
[08:20.51]Are you kidding me?
[08:22.85]Well, I'm dead.
[08:25.22]I thought I dodged that.
[08:26.00]That was bullshit.
[08:28.82]When he did the... That, like, big drag thing.
[08:31.43]Did I just bump into the wall?
[08:32.39]Was I bumping into the wall?
[08:36.01]Probably.
[08:36.49]I think I could beat him without help.
[08:40.15]That's, like, the second time I ever fought him on this guy.
[08:46.80]There's no... Ah, well, whatever.
[08:50.90]I shouldn't have tried it.
[08:52.70]I sound mad.
[08:53.46]No, this is not a mad stream.
[08:55.76]I know what I'm in for.
[08:58.66]Shit, I forgot to step on this.
[09:00.18]I have to kill this guy.
[09:06.45]Oh, dear.
[09:15.53]You didn't get me.
[09:22.91]Now we gotta wait.
[09:26.53]This isn't sorcery.
[09:27.53]Frogman for first noble.
[09:28.59]Well, thank you, KJ.
[09:33.57]Am I still sick?
[09:34.25]Yes, I am.
[09:35.83]Very much so.
[09:38.41]If I don't play this green... Wait, what?
[09:40.93]Where's... Something ain't right here.
[09:48.87]I know what the problem is.
[09:50.45]Hold on.
[09:51.53]I gotta go back to the bonfire.
[09:55.41]I need to reallocate these Estus flasks.
[10:00.51]Give him a good zap.
[10:01.29]Well, thank you.
[10:01.85]Hey, it's daft.
[10:09.16]My favorite part about playing as a sorcerer is I love playing the game, Dark Souls 3, as a sorcerer.
[10:15.04]But every time I have to fight a boss, I just... Oh, it's the worst.
[10:20.38]Where's Otto?
[10:21.12]He's right here.
[10:23.23]Is Dark Souls 3 a good game?
[10:24.47]Yes, it is.
[10:25.35]It's very good.
[10:32.43]I love just staying back and shooting the orb, but... As you guys know, like, standing still like that for more than one second in this game, in any of these games, is... You're pretty much, uh... Screwing yourself.
[10:45.92]I'm surprised I actually got this guy this far.
[10:48.26]On my own, to be honest.
[10:49.22]Okay, lost this...
[10:53.63]Yeah, so what?
[10:55.99]Is it just not equipped?
[10:57.57]Why the hell is this not equipped?
[10:59.63]That doesn't make any sense.
[11:04.57]It just wasn't even on the bar for some reason.
[11:06.35]That's kind of weird.
[11:10.19]Hey, Blurgle.
[11:10.75]Thanks for the sub.
[11:12.97]Nice Wolverine claws.
[11:13.91]Yeah.
[11:14.41]I might just not even cast spells at this guy.
[11:16.77]I might just try to fight him.
[11:20.85]Favorite Dark Souls?
[11:21.71]It's not a Dark Souls game.
[11:22.87]Bloodborne.
[11:26.07]We'll see.
[11:26.33]I'll give it one more try and then I'm going to put a network password on and we'll just go from there.
[11:36.66]Launch setting.
[11:37.30]Play offline.
[11:39.36]I'm going to have to restart the game, I think.
[11:44.60]Am I offline?
[11:46.97]Yeah, let me just restart the game.
[11:49.21]Like restart the session, technically, whatever.
[11:53.61]It's going to be loud, so I'm just...
[11:57.25]Just going to warn you right now, it's going to be loud.
[12:01.69]Real loud.
[12:06.55]You should play Bloodborne DLC on stream.
[12:09.35]Actually, no, it's not loud.
[12:10.13]It's fine.
[12:16.90]You're going to go berserk if you don't get an auto-cam.
[12:22.28]What are the other characters I have?
[12:23.28]I have Garrett.
[12:25.30]Haha.
[12:26.08]Majesto and Burpo.
[12:29.52]This is a Majesto playthrough.
[12:34.19]Makes a lot of opt.
[12:35.39]465.
[12:35.53]Yeah, so if you want to play, I guess I really don't care.
[12:41.49]I've beaten the game.
[12:42.61]I've gotten this far on this guy.
[12:44.03]I'd rather just play with people and have fun and just steamroll bosses and then play through the game.
[12:52.45]Matchmaking password.
[12:54.49]Password for matchmaking is going to be... Goop.
[13:01.04]Yeah, Goop.
[13:02.50]No, not Goop.
[13:05.98]Slurp.
[13:07.82]Password for matchmaking is going to be Slurp.
[13:11.21]If you would like to play and your soul level is the same as mine, type in Slurp.
[13:17.97]And let's kill this boss.
[13:25.13]75.
[13:25.19]Oh, those are my stats, by the way.
[13:28.53]50 int.
[13:28.63]Look at how bad all the other stats are.
[13:35.75]I went straight up just pure magic damage on this guy and nothing else.
[13:40.69]It's kind of why he sucks.
[13:42.91]But it is fun to just cast those giant, like, 800, 700 damage spells at people.
[13:52.54]Alright, I'm going to head there.
[13:53.78]Let's co-op this boss.
[14:04.07]What boss am I on?
[14:04.81]This is... Well, either Ocelot or not Ocelot.
[14:09.18]Well, that weird dragon guy.
[14:11.72]Or... I cleared everything up into these two bosses.
[14:18.30]I'm fairly close to the end of the game, aren't I?
[14:28.53]Password is Slurp.
[14:32.75]Slurp.
[14:38.14]Oh, come on now.
[14:39.82]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:41.82]I do not want to fight these guys right now.
[14:45.50]Or maybe I do.
[14:49.30]Please lock on.
[14:51.36]What?
[14:52.34]What the hell is that?
[14:57.35]Whoa, you got healed.
[14:58.85]You got healed.
[14:59.39]That's no fair.
[15:02.07]That guy's got a healer with him.
[15:07.01]Ooh, you want to try to bait me?
[15:12.01]Can I kill him before he gets healed?
[15:13.15]That's the question.
[15:17.04]Afraid to go in this room.
[15:18.26]He's dead.
[15:19.40]Stay alive.
[15:26.28]Meow.
[15:28.30]You guys like the cat noise it makes?
[15:31.26]That's my favorite part about playing the sorcerer is the kitty cat noise when you cast a ghost.
[15:35.20]Meow.
[15:36.08]Ready?
[15:42.45]Alright, going up here.
[15:45.13]Just going to summon the first couple people I see.
[15:46.95]And we're going to steamroll the boss.
[15:50.25]This is my arcane build.
[15:53.05]Yeah, kind of.
[15:54.46]Dark Souls 3 was the first game, I think.
[15:57.12]Well, you could do it in Dark Souls 2, right?
[15:59.48]Where you could play through the whole game, technically.
[16:02.60]As a straight up mage.
[16:04.92]Now, the problem with doing this... Was... What the hell is her name there?
[16:12.71]The... The magic... She's like a mage.
[16:15.87]The boss that's a mage that shoots, like, the purple shit all over the place.
[16:18.66]And the lady, she shoots like they're burrowing out of the... Oh, what's it?
[16:21.58]Aldrich.
[16:22.12]Saint Aldrich, right?
[16:23.80]She takes, like, a hundred damage a cast.
[16:25.82]So... Alright, I'm up here.
[16:30.00]Whoever wants to kill this dude.
[16:31.20]Oh, I see somebody.
[16:32.10]I see a couple people.
[16:32.86]Alright, let's take a look.
[16:34.52]Huge hammer guy.
[16:35.72]Let's see.
[16:37.79]Uh... Knight captain.
[16:40.81]Alright, what else?
[16:44.23]Another, like, knight.
[16:47.91]Uh, I like this guy's look.
[16:49.55]Firebrand, okay.
[16:50.69]And we'll summon the other guy, too.
[16:53.37]Aldrich is the goop monster.
[16:58.43]And who's the guy with the huge hammer?
[17:00.06]This guy.
[17:04.22]Uh, Dickie.
[17:04.80]Alright, these two.
[17:06.76]Alright, let's co-op this boss.
[17:10.50]What do you guys say?
[17:12.40]Aldrich is a boy.
[17:13.10]Am I thinking the right person?
[17:16.58]Hello, two friends.
[17:22.06]Oh, no!
[17:26.34]Dark Souls 3 is the weakest sorcery of all the Souls games.
[17:28.70]You can kill bosses in three casts in Dark Souls 1.
[17:32.37]Well, yeah, but it's been fun.
[17:35.61]It's been sort of frustrating, but it's been fun nonetheless.
[17:39.81]Alright, let's co-op this guy.
[17:48.77]Hello.
[17:50.87]My souls.
[17:56.05]Oh, shit.
[17:56.39]He's coming after me.
[17:57.11]I didn't really... I thought he was coming after somebody else.
[18:04.94]Uh-oh.
[18:06.88]Watch out, Dickie.
[18:09.08]Careful, Dickie.
[18:15.00]I can just stay back and be sitting with us.
[18:17.26]Wow.
[18:17.86]No, I can't.
[18:23.67]Can't be a total wuss.
[18:26.43]Will this guy eventually get a dragon to come down?
[18:29.80]Or something like that.
[18:31.84]I think so.
[18:32.58]Yeah, like the dragon's coming down now.
[18:40.68]Shoot like laser beams, yeah.
[18:49.77]Where's the laser?
[18:50.89]Where's the laser?
[18:51.49]Oh, it's behind me.
[18:53.56]Dude, there is a World of Warcraft boss that is just this guy.
[19:00.26]Whoa, drinking the wrong flask.
[19:01.70]I'm dead.
[19:03.78]Bye, guys.
[19:07.80]Oh, my God.
[19:11.06]Oh, that sucks.
[19:15.30]I just got instantly killed.
[19:18.82]Instantly.
[19:20.98]I just died instantly.
[19:23.54]Holy shit.
[19:24.96]There was no getting away from that.
[19:26.18]I gotta take off all this shit.
[19:37.33]My character is such a piece of crap.
[19:45.37]Holy shit.
[19:45.99]That was so dumb.
[19:49.01]Well...
[19:50.79]Well, I'll get one move done to me and my character dies.
[19:57.32]But I know why that happened.
[19:58.52]Because I have all these.
[19:59.51]Look at how terrible this is.
[20:03.03]I forgot to do damage as sorcerer.
[20:04.77]You have to have the worst gear in the game on.
[20:07.01]I completely forgot about that.
[20:08.12]That was my mistake.
[20:26.11]Where's the HP one?
[20:36.23]The dickie has failed.
[20:37.99]No, I just... I had the... I probably could have survived that if I didn't have all this terrible shit on.
[20:44.49]I'm actually wearing something that makes me take more damage.
[20:47.19]Which is kind of dumb.
[20:51.34]I'll just do this one.
[20:52.12]I'm curious.
[21:00.20]You're playing a pure magic damage character in New Game Plus and you can't beat the DLC bosses?
[21:05.12]Well, I would understand that, considering... It's probably nearly impossible.
[21:12.11]Unless you're... Well, New Game Plus, you can probably... Oh, man, we definitely gotta get the big fat guy.
[21:15.33]Are you serious?
[21:23.26]Yeah, we're just going for survival at the moment.
[21:26.56]So I probably should just put on a shield.
[21:31.26]Doesn't that make sense?
[21:40.83]Sure, why not?
[21:46.99]Alright, guys.
[21:47.49]Alright, the name of the game is Don't Let Me Die, okay?
[21:52.22]Go for it.
[21:57.00]The name of the game is Don't Let Jerma Die.
[22:03.32]I want those souls first.
[22:08.52]I don't know.
[22:13.54]I'm trying to see where my opportunity to swing in here is.
[22:17.27]That's not it.
[22:18.35]This guy's getting destroyed right now.
[22:23.59]Look at this dude.
[22:24.37]I want to be the big fat scarecrow.
[22:27.23]That guy has the coolest outfit.
[22:34.73]We just got so greedy.
[22:37.33]Uh-oh, careful there.
[22:42.86]Uh-oh.
[22:48.00]Uh-oh, both of my Luigi and Wario look like they're gonna die.
[23:04.16]Oh, Luigi's dead.
[23:14.87]What about Wario?
[23:15.63]Is Wario going to die too?
[23:21.30]I do no damage.
[23:22.28]Oh, shit.
[23:23.52]Which side is it going on?
[23:35.00]Uh-oh.
[23:35.80]Don't tell me I have to beat this guy myself.
[23:45.37]Whoa, can't see.
[23:49.10]What was that sumo dive?
[23:50.46]They're throwing up the puke on us.
[23:57.14]I remember this.
[24:05.51]That's not where I want to be.
[24:15.17]Oh boy, he's so close.
[24:24.99]This is going to be close.
[24:27.47]Oh, see you later.
[24:29.33]He's dead.
[24:30.31]I got to fight him.
[24:31.33]My character is not built to fight him like this.
[24:34.90]yes alright here we go hundred fucking damages wing holy shit I'm not gonna beat him
[25:09.41]Heeeeyup!
[25:18.94]Oh boy.
[25:19.48]This is where it all goes to hell.
[25:37.86]What the fuck was that?
[25:41.94]Oh no, I'm so dead.
[25:55.37]Noooo!
[25:56.55]I just don't do enough damage, dude!
[25:59.71]Bye bye, I'm dead.
[26:07.44]Alright.
[26:08.16]Maybe I should have stayed.
[26:08.98]I gotta have the staff on because at least I'll be able to hurt him.
[26:14.49]That was just a no-go there for sure.
[26:16.43]Yeah, I have to keep the staff on.
[26:22.15]It's the only way I can kill him.
[26:24.36]Doing like a hundred damage a swing.
[26:26.88]There's no fucking way I'll kill him.
[26:32.26]Alright, let's do it again.
[26:35.75]Staff and shield?
[26:36.69]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[26:37.94]I'm just going to put this on here.
[26:42.80]Can I not even do that?
[26:44.04]Maybe I can't.
[26:47.82]No, you can.
[26:50.48]Okay, yeah.
[26:52.52]Although, I wish I could switch magic rings.
[26:59.37]What is he doing?
[27:00.03]Fire?
[27:00.27]I don't even know.
[27:10.04]Yeah, I have Flash Sword, but... I'm gonna give it one more go.
[27:13.99]We'll just be in a turd and we'll see what happens.
[27:19.11]Oh, I hate that so much.
[27:21.23]There's that little lip that looks like you should be able to go through it.
[27:23.95]Password is Slurp.
[27:29.35]Oh, the final of World Series.
[27:30.61]Tied 6-6 going into the 9th inning.
[27:31.83]That's crazy.
[27:33.57]I'm looking forward to how that ends.
[27:34.97]Seeing how that ends.
[27:37.74]Yeah, I probably actually, I would have beat him if I just stayed with my staff.
[27:42.55]Because the few times I would have been able to hit him for like 300 damage would have been so much better than wildly swinging my shit for like 100 damage.
[27:54.21]Oh my god, there's so many names there.
[27:58.43]Okay, we have to take treasure chest head.
[28:00.04]That's important.
[28:02.36]What else is there?
[28:06.37]Alright, who's going to guarantee me victory?
[28:08.01]That's the thing.
[28:08.55]That's the question.
[28:10.44]Probably Dorp.
[28:21.78]Thanks a lot, Virtual Boy.
[28:22.88]Doesn't this guy take damage?
[28:26.46]This guy just is getting hurt right now.
[28:28.44]Hopefully he knows what he's doing.
[28:35.12]I got a great ragtag group of dickheads.
[28:38.40]I got Dwarf, the guy with two shields, like the pigeon person.
[28:41.96]And then, oh no, we're changing.
[28:44.20]Oh my god, you changed completely.
[28:45.54]Alright, you guys ready?
[28:49.50]Let's get it.
[28:51.29]There you go.
[29:11.81]Why are they coming after me?
[29:13.49]Am I really that big of a threat?
[29:14.43]Oh my lord.
[29:25.12]Get away from me!
[29:36.11]Here comes the dragons!
[29:45.24]Alright, there goes Niko.
[29:49.38]Oh shit, I didn't know they could go all the way over here.
[29:56.88]Leave me alone.
[30:02.22]Where is it going?
[30:03.26]That's a good point.
[30:07.45]There it is.
[30:13.39]Oh no, he's coming for me again!
[30:17.19]There he goes.
[30:19.31]Wow.
[30:29.81]Yeah.
[30:30.38]Oh, no.
[30:37.92]Whoa.
[30:44.54]I need to drink a potion so bad.
[30:50.87]Where's the lightning coming from?
[30:55.23]Yeah, smash him.
[31:14.88]Yeah.
[31:18.96]From downtown.
[31:20.82]He's dead.
[31:21.88]See ya.
[31:22.50]Good job.
[31:23.08]Hooray.
[31:23.60]We did it.
[31:27.51]Did you die?
[31:28.19]Oh no.
[31:28.51]You're still alive.
[31:30.35]Nice job.
[31:31.63]Go team.
[31:35.07]I got the sunlight medal.
[31:36.29]Excellent work.
[31:38.00]Weed head.
[31:40.44]You did a fantastic job.
[31:43.14]Bush brain.
[31:45.88]Hooray.
[31:49.45]Alright, cool.
[31:51.49]Let me put my clothes back on.
[32:01.90]I can keep that on, actually.
[32:02.86]That's fine.
[32:03.42]I can keep this on, too.
[32:05.88]I like the grandma outfit.
[32:17.73]Where'd it go?
[32:25.60]Alright.
[32:27.24]Cool.
[32:27.45]Nice work, team.
[32:28.51]Thanks, guys, for helping me out with the boss.
[32:31.89]Thank you, Baza, for the two months.
[32:33.21]Thank you, Record Keeper, for nine months.
[32:34.91]Cast Zap on your allies.
[32:36.13]Why would I do that?
[32:36.83]That would kill them.
[32:39.35]Thank you, Virtual Boy, for your subscription.
[32:42.05]Welcome, you guys.
[32:45.73]Put the claws back on.
[32:49.50]I need to switch these because I like it in my other hand.
[32:57.35]There you go.
[32:58.91]I like left-hand casting.
[33:01.65]What happened to the treasure chest dude?
[33:02.77]He got smoked.
[33:04.75]He got destroyed.
[33:05.73]Alright, what can I get for this?
[33:21.25]Go kill the dragon, you get the laser beam sword.
[33:25.45]Let me see what I can do with this first.
[33:27.53]Something I did notice is that not a whole lot of staffs in the game that really do anything.
[33:34.14]The default staff is what I was using up until about in-game hours, probably like 40 minutes ago.
[33:40.84]Alright, this is just a giant... That's a lightning.
[33:48.95]It's a faith weapon, though.
[33:51.23]And this is a giant shield, so we're just going to smash the damn thing and level up.
[33:57.46]Knight McKenzie, thanks for sticking around.
[34:02.20]And then thank you to T-Wise117.
[34:04.32]Thanks, T-Wise.
[34:07.02]I'm a new game plus character.
[34:08.10]Use the same staff as you.
[34:09.37]Yeah, there's only like three staffs that are even worth picking up.
[34:12.61]This is one of them.
[34:14.45]The other... There's one more, but you have to do... It's PvP, right?
[34:18.17]You have to be like a certain level of one of the factions.
[34:22.01]And, you know, like I'm... Don't plan on doing that.
[34:28.00]Magic is garbage in Dark Souls 3.
[34:29.93]Well, that's, uh, hence the reason why you're watching me, uh, summon people to beat the bosses.
[34:41.93]This is, like, my technically second playthrough, though, so... I got two points.
[34:48.40]You're going to go buy a bullfrog and name it Jerma and kiss it every night just so I can say, give Jerma a kiss every night.
[34:53.21]Well, appreciate that, dude.
[34:56.05]I appreciate you kissing that frog in my name.
[34:59.93]What should I do here?
[35:00.93]Should I put more endurance, more health?
[35:05.37]I'm at the point right now where I'm sort of, what is this?
[35:07.79]I'm pretty much at the hard cap for intelligence, aren't I?
[35:11.37]Or is 50 the soft cap?
[35:12.51]I don't even know.
[35:17.75]I'm gonna put one into vigor and one into endurance, I think.
[35:31.12]Do I have any more to upgrade?
[35:33.68]No, I need four more chunks.
[35:40.18]But look at that, it just sucks.
[35:41.38]Spell me going from plus eight to plus nine.
[35:46.31]Only gives me one extra spell buff?
[35:51.50]You kidding me?
[35:55.16]That sucks total ass.
[35:58.16]But I told myself, even though I know that sorcery kind of sucks ass in this game, I wanted to beat the game with a sorcerer, even if I do the last three or four bosses with other people.
[36:13.74]Remember, I still have the Wolverine Claws, so it's not a total loss.
[36:19.04]Plus, it might be fun in PvP.
[36:21.58]Even though it probably sucks in PvP.
[36:24.78]But your S goes to S, dude.
[36:26.12]I know.
[36:28.64]What else do I have here?
[36:31.63]I have the Farron Flash Sword.
[36:33.03]I should probably just put it on.
[36:41.28]Now, does that get buffed when I use this?
[36:44.44]I would hope so, right?
[36:45.14]I'm going to keep that on.
[36:49.02]I have great magic weapon, but it kind of sucks.
[36:51.02]And I don't think I can even do it anymore because I have the... Claws.
[36:59.19]So, it isn't truly beating the game, Dermot.
[37:01.27]Well...
[37:04.29]My only thing I would say to that is it's beating the game for me because I got to a point where I couldn't do anything else on this guy.
[37:13.45]I beat... Who was the boss before the weird naked dragon guy?
[37:20.49]What's his name there?
[37:23.49]Uh, Pontiff.
[37:24.41]No, not Pontiff.
[37:25.83]Pontiff was a pain in the ass because he closes gaps on you so quickly that if you get a gap closed on you from Pontiff as the sorcerer, you're dead.
[37:34.26]Took me like 10 to 15 tries to kill Pontiff on this guy.
[37:39.26]Hey, ghost food, thanks for nine months.
[37:40.50]Nine months is almost a long time.
[37:41.94]It is actually a long time already.
[37:48.36]dancer yeah actually I beat dancer dancer was actually pretty easy with this guy for some reason dancer I beat on the second try because she just stopped caring where I was she was just sitting in the corner and I was just casting over and over again just spamming missiles at her and she died alright um I think yeah there's nothing else really to do besides oh wait am I going the right way here
[38:16.78]Yes.
[38:19.02]Or a head.
[38:19.64]Is it really?
[38:20.66]Cool.
[38:23.88]Or.
[38:24.74]Chunk.
[38:25.12]I need one of those.
[38:34.72]Anything else?
[38:39.32]Bra.
[38:39.96]A head.
[38:41.64]Tight spot.
[38:42.78]That's right.
[38:43.38]It is a tight spot.
[38:44.14]You're right.
[38:50.37]Yeah, this is just an impromptu, just chill kind of stream.
[38:53.26]I felt like playing a little bit Dark Souls.
[38:54.70]I thought maybe I would just be summoning people and we'll kill the bosses.
[39:02.70]Or just summon people and maybe do PvP or something.
[39:05.25]I'm not going to stream for more than an hour or two.
[39:14.04]I forget this place.
[39:14.88]This is where the prince is, right?
[39:23.58]If memory serves me right.
[39:25.52]Here's the skip.
[39:27.66]Come on, skip.
[39:30.68]Any update on the Cubs game?
[39:32.70]Did the Cubs win?
[39:33.52]Did the Indians win?
[39:34.48]What's going on here?
[39:43.20]The Grand Archives.
[39:46.36]I remember this place.
[39:49.77]Oh shit, a magician.
[39:55.38]She's going to be kind of a pain in the ass to kill you.
[40:03.74]Where is she?
[40:10.22]The one thing that sucks about playing a ranged character like this is what just happened right there.
[40:14.18]Sometimes you just lose.
[40:17.34]Well, whoo!
[40:18.12]Hello there.
[40:23.10]Cubs won?
[40:24.76]Did they really?
[40:25.56]Oh my god.
[40:27.44]Cubs win!
[40:28.70]Cubs win!
[40:29.48]I mean, I don't necessarily care about baseball, but it's still kind of cool.
[40:46.54]They haven't won a game in a hundred years is what I was about to just say.
[40:50.97]It's still top of the ninth.
[40:54.66]Well.
[40:58.42]No.
[40:58.94]Come back here, cookie bug.
[41:04.22]No.
[41:06.46]What?
[41:07.42]What?
[41:09.88]I was going to say.
[41:15.29]Can't get back up.
[41:26.40]Be wary of above.
[41:28.46]I see.
[41:28.76]Ooh, soul of a crestfall knight.
[41:44.28]Cool.
[41:46.30]That'll help.
[41:48.94]Foul ball.
[41:50.24]Give me a play-by-play of what's happening.
[41:51.92]I need to know.
[42:04.51]Name everything that happens.
[42:14.67]See, this is why I like playing the Sorcerer.
[42:16.03]It's fun just to do this.
[42:20.57]But it's not fun to get destroyed by bosses, I will tell you.
[42:26.06]Lethal Spoon, thanks for eight months, man.
[42:28.04]Welcome.
[42:30.36]Welcome back.
[42:33.16]For eight straight months.
[42:39.50]Why are you taking more hits than everybody else?
[42:40.92]Doesn't seem fair.
[42:46.75]I see a lot of those symbols.
[42:49.03]Whoops.
[42:49.63]Oh yeah, I forgot about this.
[42:52.66]He dunked you ahead.
[42:54.88]I completely forgot about that.
[42:56.20]No, I did it.
[42:57.00]Don't do it again.
[43:03.26]I'm like a turtle goblin.
[43:06.02]I pretty much am a turtle goblin.
[43:14.61]Titanite scale.
[43:22.02]Anything else?
[43:26.72]Anything else?
[43:28.18]Ooh, there's a guy.
[43:37.32]What do you got?
[43:38.38]Let's see.
[43:40.24]I'm ready.
[43:40.66]I'm ready for you.
[43:42.16]Turn that corner or you're gonna die.
[43:43.44]I guarantee it.
[43:46.72]Guaranteed.
[43:48.22]Told ya.
[43:50.33]Stupid.
[43:50.75]I hear another cookie bug somewhere.
[44:03.55]Crystal Chime.
[44:04.69]That's not a staff.
[44:08.66]Not a staff.
[44:12.68]What is that?
[44:13.10]Is that a, uh... Gentle Prayer.
[44:21.30]That's a miracle.
[44:23.90]Miracles, bah!
[44:25.56]Who needs a miracle when you have sorcery?
[44:32.18]Hmm...
[44:34.90]Face reveal if the Cubs win.
[44:36.49]Alright, fine.
[44:41.89]If the Cubs win, I'll do a face reveal.
[44:50.64]Torch required ahead.
[44:52.10]I forget this whole area.
[44:58.10]Should be studying for my exam, but love for Jerma is too strong.
[45:01.22]Well, thanks, Hipper.
[45:02.40]Good luck on your exam.
[45:04.46]Hope you get an A-.
[45:06.02]Because you don't want to ask for too much, you know?
[45:11.03]There's like a bunch of cookie bugs over here.
[45:12.55]I'm only going to get one.
[45:26.91]We're not getting a face reveal.
[45:31.35]Yeah, don't ever wish somebody an A+, because then it's too much pressure.
[45:34.20]Oh, I hope you get an A-plus on that exam.
[45:37.04]It's like, shit, man.
[45:42.93]A+.
[45:45.85]It's too much pressure.
[45:50.92]A- is like that's you did a great job.
[45:54.04]You did more than a great job.
[45:56.25]You did a fantastic job Let's just go Nothing to lock on to?
[46:20.15]You're telling me there's nothing to lock onto here?
[46:22.99]What the fuck was that?
[46:26.60]Why can I not lock onto this guy?
[46:31.28]Can you lock onto the guy?
[46:32.56]There's a guy here.
[46:33.96]I promise.
[46:37.60]Oh my god.
[46:38.51]That was a load of absolute dog shit.
[46:53.27]You don't see the guy right there.
[46:59.35]I'm telling you there's a guy.
[47:00.35]I'm telling you there's a guy there, man.
[47:07.00]You know what?
[47:07.44]Fuck it.
[47:07.78]We're gonna cheese this guy then.
[47:15.09]Almost there.
[47:15.65]Almost there.
[47:18.77]He's like, what happened?
[47:19.63]Who did this?
[47:20.03]Somebody casted a spell down this hallway?
[47:27.54]Is the wax that's doing that?
[47:28.74]Are you kidding me?
[47:32.60]Well, then I'm just gonna have to fucking fuck this guy up.
[47:39.16]Yeah!
[47:39.42]Alright, can I like aggro him out here now?
[47:44.69]Please?
[47:46.55]Away from the dumb hands.
[47:53.65]Come on.
[47:55.79]Come on.
[47:56.43]What's this guy's problem?
[47:59.02]Get out here.
[48:00.48]Get out here!
[48:04.84]Fine.
[48:05.52]I don't even need you.
[48:11.36]It's too dark.
[48:12.85]Well, it wasn't dark enough for me to see that guy.
[48:14.61]I could easily see.
[48:15.67]That guy just scared the crap out of me.
[48:25.71]Chunk.
[48:29.03]Uh, cookie bug.
[48:40.32]Whoa!
[48:41.24]Forgot about the person that's up there.
[48:48.06]When I sneeze, do I sneeze twice?
[48:49.86]Yeah, sometimes.
[48:52.64]Anything else in here that I need?
[48:53.62]I don't think so.
[48:54.32]It doesn't happen every single time I sneeze, but, you know, it still happens.
[48:59.58]There's a ladder.
[49:03.74]Where does this lead to?
[49:05.74]It's like a little skip, right?
[49:11.26]Isn't there an invisible wall around here and you fight a giant scary thing that I don't want to fight for sure right now?
[49:21.97]If it's too dark, how come I can see these guys?
[49:28.52]Hey, happy pants.
[49:29.12]Thanks for the six months, dude.
[49:31.60]Welcome back.
[49:37.88]Oh, you guys have grenades.
[49:40.14]Well, that's not cool.
[49:43.84]I can do my projectile, too.
[49:49.89]That just predicted my movements.
[49:51.69]I'm a pro.
[49:56.46]Quick, dunk your head in.
[49:57.18]You're waiting for the compilation of all the times I've almost puked on stream?
[50:06.30]This happens actually quite a few times, probably.
[50:09.48]I think I have enough to upgrade the staff, but why the hell would I at this point?
[50:23.73]I don't like this guy's attitude.
[50:30.87]He's got quite an attitude, if you ask me.
[50:33.25]Hmm, just gonna go up the ladder.
[50:46.55]When am I going to commit to puke on stream and then get banned from Twitch?
[50:50.41]That's a good question.
[50:54.57]Oh boy, I'm going to have to take out the big guns for this.
[50:57.83]I'm not going to be able to do very much damage to her.
[51:00.59]Him, her, whatever it is.
[51:01.75]Here comes the icicle.
[51:17.68]Icicle coming.
[51:18.34]I can feel it.
[51:22.71]Wow, I knew it.
[51:24.05]Wow.
[51:24.93]I just feel like an Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[51:27.17]Wow, I can feel it.
[51:29.98]Here comes Icicle.
[51:30.94]Wow.
[51:44.93]I'm gonna go up or down.
[51:45.93]I'm almost out of source for you, Juice.
[51:50.95]And then it's back to the drawing board.
[51:54.05]No!
[51:54.50]Don't do that!
[51:56.38]You see what I mean?
[51:57.24]Alright, well.
[52:01.22]Now I gotta... ...play safe.
[52:10.36]He has thrown bombs.
[52:11.24]Of course he is.
[52:22.10]Please stop doing that.
[52:25.17]Oh my god, you take so much damage.
[52:32.59]Oh, boy.
[52:34.49]Okey-dokey, I'll take that.
[52:36.27]Thank you.
[52:36.89]This is the illusionary wall, isn't it?
[52:41.05]Yep.
[52:41.45]And this is where the fucking... I knew it.
[52:43.15]There he is.
[52:43.59]I don't want to go in here.
[52:45.12]No, I'm not going in there.
[52:46.06]Are you kidding me?
[52:47.94]This is a disaster waiting to happen.
[52:49.64]What the hell was that noise?
[52:58.86]Oh, no.
[52:59.74]No, no, no.
[53:01.06]What?! !
[53:02.48]No, somebody has the password and is invading as Donald Trump.
[53:07.51]I gotta get out of here.
[53:09.53]Ow, shit.
[53:12.95]Oh, this is not good at all.
[53:15.21]This is bad.
[53:17.19]Bad.
[53:18.87]Bad.
[53:19.57]This is bad, I'm surrounded.
[53:28.01]Where can I run to?
[53:28.71]I don't think there's anywhere I can run to here.
[53:30.37]Yeah, there is.
[53:33.27]I got Donald Trump after me.
[53:35.67]Run!
[53:38.58]What?
[53:39.40]Where?
[53:40.08]Where?
[53:41.02]Where?
[53:41.90]Where?
[53:42.94]There he is.
[53:44.20]There's Donald Trump.
[53:46.78]What's he doing?
[53:55.45]I need to kill this guy, Donald.
[53:58.58]Leave me alone.
[53:59.24]I have a lot of souls and I don't have anywhere to go besides up that way in front of the lady.
[54:07.10]Run.
[54:08.72]That's all I can do.
[54:17.15]No!
[54:17.99]Donald Trump!
[54:19.47]Get the fuck out of here.
[54:21.43]Oh, you piece of shit.
[54:24.60]No, no, no you don't!
[54:26.44]No you do not!
[54:27.84]No you do not!
[54:28.76]Fuuuuck!
[54:29.80]Fuuuuck!
[54:32.60]I made it!
[54:33.02]I did the skip!
[54:33.76]I touched the skip.
[54:37.89]Elevator down.
[54:42.65]Elevator down.
[54:43.95]Made it.
[54:46.31]He dropped an item for you?
[54:52.64]Elevator down.
[54:54.86]What?
[54:55.00]What are you talking about?
[54:58.33]No, what are you talking about?
[55:02.91]What is this talking about?
[55:09.80]Huh?
[55:18.88]It didn't get it.
[55:19.38]Oh, that was great.
[55:27.70]I'm glad that just happened.
[55:35.28]Well... Hope everybody got their laughs in.
[55:39.57]Hope everybody got their giggles in.
[55:52.93]I'm just fucking laughing about that already.
[55:57.79]Where the hell did that even go?
[56:05.66]I can't even unlock that because I died.
[56:07.70]Oh my god.
[56:08.74]I'm just fucking running then.
[56:14.96]No, it's the wrong way.
[56:17.26]We're just going up.
[56:18.76]I don't even care.
[56:19.20]I'm not stopping to fight anything anymore.
[56:20.76]I'm just gonna get invaded and somebody's gonna kill me.
[56:26.23]I'm just gonna get attacked.
[56:28.61]Some guy's gonna ruin my skip.
[56:31.59]Oh, that's not the right way.
[56:36.49]Rump is the swear word, isn't it?
[56:40.11]I get lost up here.
[56:44.20]Isn't one of those, uh... I'm dead.
[56:47.76]I died.
[56:50.88]Ah, stream's over.
[56:54.16]I just like... I just took it all out of me right there.
[56:57.42]I can't... I was like progressing and Donald Trump fucking trolled me.
[57:06.81]And then I rolled off of bookcase and died.
[57:19.93]No, you know what?
[57:20.55]Let's go kill that.
[57:21.23]Let's go kill a boss.
[57:26.53]Let's go kill the boss.
[57:37.08]Oh, where is it?
[57:39.48]Where the fuck is it?
[57:44.12]What this area needs is poison slugs.
[57:47.79]I did that to myself.
[57:49.87]I should have guessed.
[57:51.71]I have a password set on the fucking stream, and I told everybody what it was.
[57:55.53]No, I'm gonna go PvE.
[57:57.15]Wait, no, just kidding.
[58:00.27]Please invade me and fuck up my whole game.
[58:06.11]Let's go kill a boss.
[58:06.91]Let's go kill the Ocelot guy.
[58:08.21]I'm looking for Gundyr.
[58:12.64]I did that accidentally the first time.
[58:24.56]Do you guys remember when I streamed Dark Souls 3 and I beat Gunder first try?
[58:28.61]Champion Gunder.
[58:31.35]Oh, wait.
[58:31.55]Passwords don't ignore invasions.
[58:32.87]Anyone can invade you.
[58:34.96]Wow.
[58:35.98]What a dumb game.
[58:40.56]There it is.
[58:48.96]Yeah, I beat Gundyr first try.
[58:51.54]I stumbled into the area, didn't know where the hell I was, and then killed that guy on the first try.
[58:57.38]Let's, uh... Let us fight Mr. Ocelot.
[59:02.93]Let's get some people in here.
[59:06.95]Who am I voting for?
[59:07.79]I told you, I'm writing in Benjamin Franklin.
[59:14.75]I'm gonna write Benjamin Franklin's... Franklin's...
[59:25.77]Hey, costly access.
[59:29.35]Thanks for those bits, man.
[59:32.93]I hope this is down.
[59:33.91]I don't think it is.
[59:38.75]Is it down?
[59:46.01]Don't you get in here with me.
[59:47.83]They're both in here.
[59:48.65]And they're not dead.
[59:52.00]They're both still alive.
[59:53.18]Okay, they both got off the pit stop, but now they're still going to be down here, aren't they?
[60:00.84]Come on.
[60:01.14]Any second now, he's going to fall to his death.
[60:03.44]Right in front of me.
[60:05.62]Maybe not.
[60:08.97]Alright.
[60:11.51]For the purposes of those guys up there, put your summoning thing in here, because I can't really stand around those guys that kill me.
[60:25.75]If you want to do the boss.
[60:26.85]Password is slurp.
[60:32.71]Password is slurp.
[60:36.07]Put it down over here so we can actually get you guys in the game.
[60:40.96]Have I really been streaming for an hour already?
[60:42.46]Holy crap.
[60:52.69]It's raining at game seven right now.
[60:54.83]Everything is stopped.
[60:55.99]Are you serious?
[60:58.70]Everything is stopped.
[61:01.04]God doesn't want that game to be done.
[61:06.00]Wait a minute.
[61:06.46]Are the Cubs going to win?
[61:08.70]Just stop raining.
[61:16.03]Oh, no.
[61:17.31]Oh, no.
[61:20.03]The Beanie Baby is going to make his way in here.
[61:27.90]Summoning, wait.
[61:32.65]Good luck.
[61:34.65]I made it into your game.
[61:40.15]Is he dead?
[61:41.03]Is he alive?
[61:42.13]I don't know what to do here.
[61:44.01]I'm a bystander.
[61:45.23]I'm not sure what to do.
[61:46.69]He's gonna die.
[61:53.82]How after all that am I gonna die?
[62:02.03]These guys have so much health.
[62:04.88]They might as well be a boss.
[62:09.88]Why did I summon this guy?
[62:12.38]This guy can kill us in the fight, in the boss fight.
[62:15.27]Why did I summon this guy?
[62:19.82]This dude's gonna fucking attack me.
[62:22.72]Of course!
[62:23.84]Of course!
[62:24.80]Why?
[62:25.22]What else would happen?
[62:26.76]What else was gonna happen there?
[62:28.40]Like, really, what else was gonna happen?
[62:34.61]How did I not put on my fucking 3D glasses and not see that was gonna happen from a mile away?
[62:41.43]First it was Donald Trump, then it was Pepe.
[62:46.09]I just fucking wasted.
[62:48.76]And Ember.
[62:52.25]That was seriously was Wario and Waluigi, and Waluigi had to just ruin it.
[63:10.23]Thanks Kylo Ren for your five months, dude.
[63:12.67]And thanks Paragon Sheep for the three months.
[63:15.61]Welcome back, both of you guys.
[63:21.32]I mean, I'll summon this guy right now.
[63:24.04]This is Dicky.
[63:24.70]I remember Dicky.
[63:30.34]Killer Crocomar, thanks for the 1500.
[63:32.20]What does Croc say?
[63:34.80]Croc says, Hey, I just built a PC for the first time ever, and it actually didn't explode in works.
[63:40.49]Here's some of my happiness to share all the love.
[63:42.31]Well, thanks, Crocomar.
[63:44.83]Hope it goes well for you.
[63:45.85]My first PC that I built.
[63:48.01]Here's a funny story for you.
[63:50.11]So, the first ever PC that I built.
[63:52.25]I'm not even sure if I've ever told this.
[63:53.25]If I have, maybe I did.
[63:56.93]I bought all the parts.
[64:00.25]I went to the Micro Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
[64:03.70]It's a huge supermarket.
[64:05.50]Place is great.
[64:06.10]Whoa, he dropped a money bag.
[64:07.34]What is it?
[64:08.72]Eight ember.
[64:09.30]Oh my god.
[64:09.86]Thanks for the eight embers, dude.
[64:13.16]I know I can't give these back to you because I don't know how to throw them on the ground.
[64:16.57]But thank you, Mr. Mushroom Cauliflower Brain.
[64:19.75]How is this guy already dead?
[64:21.45]Oh.
[64:23.13]So I went to the Micro Center, bought all the parts.
[64:26.13]I was so excited.
[64:26.97]Can't wait.
[64:27.45]Oh my god, this is going to be so much fun.
[64:29.67]Put it all together.
[64:33.42]Put the PCI slot.
[64:35.54]Oh, cool.
[64:36.12]Wow.
[64:36.96]Excellent.
[64:38.08]That fits.
[64:39.18]Gotta make sure you get the temperature goo to put on over the CPU.
[64:43.46]Put it down there.
[64:44.09]Oh, wow.
[64:44.73]Four hours go by.
[64:45.43]I build the whole thing.
[64:47.59]Plugged it into the wall.
[64:49.25]Pressed the power button.
[64:50.83]And heard... So, I unplugged everything, started crying, and returned all the stuff to the microcentre.
[65:03.90]I swear to God, that's a true story.
[65:12.48]I swear to God, that's real.
[65:20.44]Watch out!
[65:20.94]Don't die, Dickey!
[65:22.00]Don't die, Dickey!
[65:24.34]Dickey!
[65:25.16]Dickey's dead!
[65:26.30]Dickey died.
[65:32.47]Yeah, I cried.
[65:34.67]And then returned everything.
[65:36.47]How old was I?
[65:37.21]You know, this is like seven years ago.
[65:42.63]Something like that.
[65:43.93]I was like 22.
[65:44.77]What am I doing, Dickie?
[65:52.43]These guys are a pain in the ass.
[65:53.71]Especially right in front of this guy's door.
[66:02.52]I did tell that story in an update video.
[66:04.42]Yeah.
[66:07.02]I fucking just like returned it.
[66:09.04]I fucked everything up and I had like brought it all back.
[66:12.70]You made it sound like you were 14.
[66:13.96]Yeah, I probably like wanted to pretend like I was 14.
[66:16.63]I'm sure in that video I was like, yeah, you know, my first PC I was like 12 when I did 14.
[66:20.83]No, I was like 20.
[66:22.55]At least.
[66:22.91]I'm gonna wait for this guy.
[66:35.31]Does chat know that I'm old as fuck?
[66:36.97]Well, I can tell you right now I'm old as fuck.
[66:43.08]Did I buy a pre-built?
[66:43.90]Yeah, I have my... The first PC that I really had that was a pre-built was from Digital Storm.
[66:52.27]Alright, guys.
[66:53.61]Time to gear up.
[66:55.65]You guys ready to gear up?
[66:59.43]Let's do it.
[67:00.93]Let's beat this dragon.
[67:03.21]Oh yeah, I forgot I can't hurt this guy either.
[67:06.13]I do like a hundred and something damage to him.
[67:08.07]Actually, yeah, no, actually I do.
[67:09.13]I do.
[67:11.77]Oh, awesome.
[67:14.69]Hey, you.
[67:15.23]This is where he goes crazy.
[67:28.39]He's gonna go nuts!
[67:29.77]A little awesome.
[67:37.51]Just don't get run over by his train move, which is this.
[67:46.60]No, that's not the train move.
[67:52.86]What's he gonna do?
[67:53.66]Yeah, he runs right into a wall.
[67:59.35]Here he comes!
[68:02.11]Woo!
[68:02.83]He almost got me.
[68:06.76]Woo!
[68:07.78]Woo!
[68:08.34]Woo!
[68:08.86]There he goes!
[68:13.53]No, I went the wrong way.
[68:14.57]No, wrong way.
[68:19.51]Is he too far away?
[68:31.84]We are hurting them.
[68:38.69]I feel like I'm playing World of Warcraft.
[68:40.51]Uh-oh, there goes Elias.
[68:44.47]Just me and you.
[68:45.29]Me and you, Sergeant.
[68:48.29]And who is he going for?
[68:50.29]He's going for you.
[68:55.94]I gotta be careful here.
[69:08.00]And I should be able to get him.
[69:15.22]Couple more hits.
[69:24.21]Okay, my whole body hurts after that one.
[69:27.77]He's dead.
[69:28.60]Nice work.
[69:33.50]Nice job.
[69:34.46]Thanks for the help.
[69:39.89]This guy has a giant bow and arrow.
[69:41.63]Do you remember the pig?
[69:44.99]We're talking about PCs again.
[69:51.71]I really want to build another PC.
[69:54.61]But I'm just such a wuss.
[69:57.30]But I did build one.
[69:58.88]I have built a computer before.
[70:01.14]That I didn't instantly return.
[70:03.66]It wasn't even really mine.
[70:07.40]He was my girlfriend at the time.
[70:09.62]Yeah, I built a computer and we like sat around and we were laughing and having all kinds of fun and we had like a six pack of wine.
[70:18.74]Built a computer for, what does it work baby?
[70:20.62]I don't know.
[70:21.68]Turned on.
[70:22.16]Wow.
[70:23.10]Oh, whoa.
[70:27.45]This fucking story.
[70:28.45]It ain't true.
[70:29.91]I fucking made it up.
[70:33.85]None of that ever happened.
[70:38.94]Ooh, what about you?
[70:39.83]You look like you're gonna get up.
[70:43.02]I have too many souls.
[70:43.76]I'm gonna run away.
[70:58.71]Do you have a girlfriend?
[70:59.45]No, I know.
[71:00.91]It was a good story, though.
[71:02.45]I wonder how many stories I've ever told.
[71:05.58]That... Like, I wonder how many times I've made up random shit to you guys.
[71:10.96]And told you true things at the same time.
[71:13.24]It's probably happened like a hundred times now.
[71:15.72]You guys don't even know my real life.
[71:17.03]Alright, I need to go see what he can do.
[71:23.23]How many times have I, like, told you guys the truth?
[71:25.53]I wonder.
[71:27.15]You guys even know the real me?
[71:34.41]No more lies.
[71:35.21]Oh, what is this one?
[71:38.11]Oh, boy.
[71:39.11]This requires 50 sorcery.
[71:43.89]What is this?
[71:53.41]Now, we can talk about women, though.
[71:54.88]This is like a late night just hangout stream.
[71:59.84]Is this worth it?
[72:01.40]Does this thing suck?
[72:02.14]Because, I mean, it requires 50 intellect.
[72:05.54]Intelligence.
[72:06.36]I feel like this is something I should get.
[72:10.54]Oh, here's the... Ugh.
[72:13.06]Magic the blade.
[72:14.06]I don't know.
[72:14.50]This thing seems... Which one am I going to get?
[72:16.64]Yeah, that's good, but... I need 16 strength.
[72:22.49]I have dog shit for strength right now.
[72:28.33]Alright, am I gonna get the sword or am I gonna get the dragon breath?
[72:38.51]Hey, Darth Fate, thanks for the sub, dude.
[72:40.53]Or Death Fate.
[72:41.33]Darth Fate!
[72:46.16]Guys, Jerma was last with a girl four months ago.
[72:47.98]How do you know that?
[72:49.24]Who told you that?
[72:53.26]Who told you that?
[72:55.70]Do a poll...
[72:58.02]The Moonlit Sword.
[72:58.98]I actually used this in my third Bloodborne playthrough.
[73:10.37]Get the Dragon Breath.
[73:11.31]I feel like I want the Dragon Breath, even if it sucks.
[73:20.01]Yeah, the sword does go zap, but... I don't know.
[73:27.85]You told us that four months thing.
[73:29.79]Yeah, I did, didn't I?
[73:34.48]You can use the spell.
[73:35.42]I'm doing the spell.
[73:36.50]Fuck it.
[73:39.26]Swords are cooler, but they're not giant weird ice crystals that probably are terrible, but I'm gonna get it.
[73:47.24]50 intellect versus this thing requires 26.
[73:52.90]Get the spell and have somebody drop you this sword.
[73:58.70]That's so cheap.
[74:01.20]That is so cheese.
[74:02.30]I'm getting the spell.
[74:05.00]Let's try it.
[74:09.97]Let's put it on.
[74:10.57]Let's see what it does.
[74:11.51]Let's replace this for now.
[74:17.75]Crystal Breath.
[74:19.51]Crystal Breath.
[74:28.70]What the hell is that?
[74:34.99]Okay.
[74:37.37]That's kind of cool.
[74:38.15]I actually like it.
[74:48.38]Can't wield the sword anyways.
[74:49.58]I know.
[74:49.84]I don't have enough strength.
[74:51.14]We're going to give this a try.
[74:52.97]We'll see how much damage it does.
[74:59.32]I didn't have a girlfriend four months ago.
[75:00.72]I was seeing somebody.
[75:04.42]It's a little different.
[75:07.32]Yeah, dude, there's no way.
[75:08.98]It would take me, like, another three hours to put that sword on.
[75:11.94]Farewell, Ashen One.
[75:20.07]If you talk shit about your build, it's because you've ruined it.
[75:22.49]Look, I spent this entire time trying to get to 50 intelligence so I could use the best sorcery move in the game, and it's this one.
[75:29.29]This is the best sorcery move in the game.
[75:38.30]Okay.
[75:38.96]Can I go to the new zone from this area?
[75:43.14]Or the secret zone?
[75:45.64]Dangerously single right now.
[75:50.27]Enjoy your fine six-pack.
[75:56.24]Well, thanks, Hepper.
[75:57.92]Appreciate it, dude.
[76:00.66]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[76:01.94]1,500 bits.
[76:03.30]That's a lot of bits.
[76:06.36]You could do all kinds of stuff with those bits.
[76:10.97]How far?
[76:11.25]What's the reach on this?
[76:16.33]That's pretty far.
[76:20.32]We should date Jerma.
[76:21.60]Or should we?
[76:21.96]Alright, who's gonna... One of these guys is getting up.
[76:26.86]I know that for certain.
[76:27.70]Might as well just find out which one.
[76:32.68]Hi.
[76:33.58]Hi there.
[76:33.94]This guy looks like a dog.
[76:37.08]Alright, we'll fucking get spiked.
[76:41.83]And you guys didn't?
[76:43.09]This is not the best ability in the whole game?
[76:45.21]Are you serious?
[76:48.97]This thing buffed up is going to do like a thousand damage.
[76:53.22]You guys tell me not to get this?
[76:54.72]What are you talking about?
[76:59.96]Why would you date anyone ever?
[77:01.10]Well, it's funny you say that.
[77:02.60]Because after college... Path of the Dragon.
[77:07.14]There it is.
[77:11.38]Anything else in here?
[77:13.92]Let's go to the dragon place.
[77:15.50]I've never seen it.
[77:16.93]Not kidding.
[77:21.88]Oh, seems familiar.
[77:23.00]Look, it's a mimic chest.
[77:27.58]No, it isn't.
[77:35.37]Oh, my God.
[77:36.11]Oh, here it is.
[77:36.95]Here it is.
[77:37.53]This is where Champion Gundyr is.
[77:43.92]Let's just get the bonfire, and I want to go to the other place.
[77:47.74]So...
[77:49.86]So I dated in college a lot.
[77:52.96]I was one of those guys that probably every like four months or so, five months in college, I had a new thing with a girl.
[78:02.82]Nothing major, of course, but, you know, we're just like, oh, yeah, we're both kind of here and we both like each other.
[78:07.60]Okay.
[78:10.12]I dated at the end of college.
[78:12.89]But I said to myself when I was like 20, I was probably like 21 at the time, 22 at the time.
[78:20.81]I wasn't a player, please.
[78:24.02]In Psychology 101.
[78:25.50]Yeah, Finestra.
[78:26.66]Me and her.
[78:35.56]Thanks, Quackadon.
[78:36.42]Welcome.
[78:38.02]Welcome.
[78:40.60]Now, where is... I know it's in an odd spot where it's overlooking a big... Where is that place where you sit down with that
[78:52.14]Isn't it like here somewhere?
[78:54.14]No, it's here somewhere.
[78:55.80]Here.
[78:57.13]It's in... Herethal, isn't it?
[79:00.73]It's like around Pont of Sullivan or like the church or something.
[79:06.41]But anyways, after dating a lot, you get kind of sick of it.
[79:10.79]You're like, I don't want to do this anymore.
[79:14.72]I'm just kind of done.
[79:16.32]I want me time.
[79:17.36]I'm not going to have all this fucking me time.
[79:20.38]And something that you don't realize is after you get out of college or you get out of like high school or you're not like around a shitload of people all the time.
[79:28.98]So when you're in college, when you're in high school, there's people everywhere.
[79:30.86]There's always like just people around.
[79:32.68]There's always like girls, guys, whatever you're into.
[79:35.40]I don't, you know, whatever floats your boat.
[79:38.50]There's tons of people.
[79:39.46]And when you get out of college, there's no more fucking people around.
[79:44.42]You have to like go out and like to out to a bar to even see somebody else.
[79:50.61]So I told myself after college, I was like, I can't wait to be single forever.
[79:54.33]After like seven years of that, it's kind of like... I kind of don't want to be single anymore.
[80:09.65]Is it central erithyll?
[80:10.65]Somebody just said it.
[80:16.77]I went to college with Jerma.
[80:17.81]He was wild.
[80:18.59]What?
[80:21.39]I don't even, like, hate the bar scene, really, at all, either.
[80:24.23]It's not, like, my favorite thing to do in the world.
[80:32.00]But it's fucking... Especially because, like, this is what I do.
[80:35.94]I, like, make YouTube videos and, like, stream and shit.
[80:39.05]Not, like, sitting around the water cooler anytime soon, you know what I mean?
[80:51.18]Here's the dungeon.
[80:52.46]Can I get there from here?
[80:58.84]Gotta spread your genes.
[81:00.22]Alright, which way is it?
[81:04.19]It's somewhere.
[81:09.87]Oh, it's right past the enemies that drain your health?
[81:11.45]Is it really?
[81:11.95]Oh, wait a minute.
[81:12.47]I think I know where that is.
[81:13.31]I think I know what you're talking about.
[81:28.23]It's not the Profane Capital.
[81:29.53]It's here, right?
[81:30.27]I don't have a Prentice.
[81:34.08]And I think... You're like 40s.
[81:40.56]I'm not like 40.
[81:41.92]I'm not even close to 40.
[81:44.13]I'm barely 30.
[81:46.33]Alright, which is the way?
[81:49.81]This way?
[81:54.47]Isn't it this way?
[82:03.47]Yeah, I could just man up and go out every weekend and actively walk up and talk to people.
[82:13.34]But we're in different times.
[82:14.82]We're in a different age.
[82:17.50]Like 10 years ago, you could do that.
[82:20.64]You could walk up to people and be like, Hey, sweetie.
[82:23.12]I'll buy you a drink.
[82:26.80]It's hard to do that now.
[82:28.91]Because there's so many creepy fucks.
[82:32.53]That walking up to a girl and being like, hey, you know, I think you're pretty cute.
[82:37.19]It's like, this guy's a fucking murderer.
[82:39.11]I gotta get out of here.
[82:43.46]Hope I'm going the right way.
[82:45.96]No, I'm definitely not going the right way.
[82:47.18]Let's just run.
[82:49.62]I'm just gonna go this way.
[82:52.98]Maybe there's a mimic chest here.
[82:56.41]Not here anymore.
[82:57.41]Watch out, there's a fucking rat.
[83:09.75]Yeah, but you know what I mean?
[83:10.39]Like, talking to people is much harder these days just because we live in, like, weird times.
[83:22.93]Or even if your intentions are not necessarily bad, it's hard to, like, start a conversation with people.
[83:31.32]And I am just fucking walking in circles.
[83:33.34]I have no idea where the hell I'm going.
[83:36.20]Just homeward boning the hell out of here.
[83:48.50]Thanks, Jerry Bean.
[83:49.64]Appreciate it, dude.
[83:52.23]Is it this way, then?
[83:55.43]Just kind of straight through and then run through?
[83:57.39]Out of the way.
[84:04.05]Like, this way?
[84:05.19]And then through when I go down, like, out the door?
[84:15.04]Second elevator down the stairs.
[84:21.97]Isn't this like an exit over here somewhere I can just drop down and run out?
[84:24.95]Yeah, like right here.
[84:26.57]Is that going to do it?
[84:27.17]Oh, come on.
[84:44.92]Is this where it is?
[84:46.14]I feel like this is it.
[84:58.75]This is definitely it.
[85:00.34]Yes, this is it.
[85:03.01]Found it.
[85:09.10]You met your boyfriend at the produce section?
[85:13.70]Good for you.
[85:15.32]You always have that, like, weird... That weird fantasy in your brain.
[85:20.62]Where you... Okay, well, I'm at, like, the grocery store.
[85:23.14]I wonder if I'm gonna bump into somebody.
[85:25.00]You see, like, a girl... This happens to me sometimes.
[85:27.25]I see, like, a fairly attractive woman, you know, buying peas.
[85:32.11]And you go over in your brain a hundred times, like...
[85:34.63]Oh, wow, I wonder if she's, like, single.
[85:36.49]Oh, hey, what's going on?
[85:37.21]Oh, it's peas, huh?
[85:38.01]I love peas.
[85:39.17]Uh, yeah, what's going on?
[85:40.07]Whoa, whoa, we bumped into each other.
[85:41.37]Wow, we both like each other.
[85:42.61]We're both in love with each other.
[85:43.77]Whoa, wow, like, we can tell this story.
[85:46.77]Never happens that way.
[85:48.74]Sometimes it happens to people.
[85:52.54]Where is it?
[85:53.00]There it is.
[85:56.98]You just have to go over, like, oh, yeah, man, wouldn't that be great?
[86:00.18]And then, nah, that's just not gonna, that's just not gonna happen.
[86:07.23]How long do I do?
[86:07.91]Okay, good.
[86:11.28]That pretty much happened, actually.
[86:14.16]Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[86:15.18]I'm so sorry.
[86:28.54]You should just go out with the peas.
[86:30.08]They're always sickle.
[86:40.36]Another feeling.
[86:40.88]I've never had a girlfriend.
[86:41.96]I'm 22, but I just got together with a person I want to spend the rest of my life with and I have never been happier.
[86:45.62]Well, that's good for you, dude.
[86:47.62]I'm glad to hear it.
[86:54.80]I have never seen this area.
[86:55.82]It's the first time I've ever seen this.
[86:59.02]All new to me.
[87:00.88]The Cubs win?
[87:03.94]The Cubs win or the Cubs lose?
[87:07.99]Is the whole nation in mourning right now?
[87:10.29]Did the Cubs lose?
[87:11.77]I'm looking it up right now.
[87:14.39]Let's find out.
[87:18.10]I'm just going to type in Cubs.
[87:23.38]Oh, they won.
[87:24.18]Oh, they didn't win.
[87:25.86]No, it's the top of the seventh.
[87:28.42]Oh, no.
[87:29.45]Cubs are going to win.
[87:32.19]Game's not over.
[87:33.09]I don't have to do a face reveal.
[87:41.18]Alright, this area looks like one of the coolest areas in the game.
[87:47.34]Why did they hide this behind this stupid optional area?
[87:50.28]This is like way more interesting looking than everywhere else.
[87:58.98]Oh damn, this place is cool.
[88:06.97]They'll choke.
[88:08.41]They're gonna choke.
[88:16.55]Yeah, this move is pretty cool.
[88:18.73]If you can get it off, it works pretty well.
[88:21.43]Wow!
[88:22.05]Hi there.
[88:22.47]I think it's potentially a little too dangerous to use here.
[88:29.14]I'm gonna go back to Solero.
[88:41.34]Nothing over here.
[88:48.02]Lots of people that way.
[88:54.23]You shoot fireballs out of your mouth.
[88:59.33]Couple of bones.
[89:10.03]Cool.
[89:11.52]Lightning gem.
[89:14.94]So that's where this is.
[89:19.18]I don't think I ever found this in the base game.
[89:24.79]This place is awesome.
[89:29.75]It was a little late there.
[89:31.03]Hello.
[89:39.42]Hello.
[89:48.15]Not today.
[89:49.77]Not today.
[89:54.17]Maybe next time.
[89:59.96]That was not good.
[90:14.41]Actually, somebody said a while ago they were like...
[90:17.98]Man, why don't you just, like, start talking to people on Twitch and YouTube?
[90:25.32]Find, like, a girl on Twitch!
[90:27.90]Find a girl on YouTube!
[90:29.38]And I'm just like, I don't know, man.
[90:31.48]Doesn't that feel a little bit weird?
[90:35.38]Like, can you imagine a scenario?
[90:39.34]Like, what does that even mean?
[90:42.00]Like, oh, I got an idea.
[90:42.82]I'm gonna, like, host this girl.
[90:45.78]See, I like you, and I hosted you.
[90:52.04]just screams odd to me should probably rest at this bonfire make your relationship viewable on Twitch
[91:18.04]This place could use some swamp water.
[91:21.99]Yeah, this place could use some poison water, too.
[91:26.35]Thanks, Baked.
[91:28.69]Thanks, Mr. Flaked.
[91:31.11]For the 15 bucks.
[91:32.35]Much appreciated, dude.
[91:34.21]You're too pure for that.
[91:40.12]Hosted you on Twitter.
[91:41.34]Time for a dragon.
[91:44.36]Well, it's time for a dragon.
[91:47.38]Wherever that dragon may be.
[91:50.54]Be wary of dragon.
[91:52.90]Hmm.
[91:55.64]Dragon in this door?
[91:56.91]Ah, there's a guy up there.
[92:04.75]That guy's a lot bigger than the other ones.
[92:08.89]I'm going to kite him down here.
[92:10.43]This guy's like three times bigger.
[92:22.32]Oh, be wary of dragon.
[92:24.36]I was pretty wary.
[92:35.32]Date a dragon.
[92:40.45]Where are you?
[92:45.77]See how fun sorcery is?
[92:47.01]It's so much fun to spellcast.
[92:50.43]But...
[92:52.76]Not fun at all when you have to fight a boss that's aggressive.
[93:06.14]Am I going to stand tall for Turtle Ball 2?
[93:07.82]Uh, no.
[93:11.08]Probably not.
[93:13.91]I played Titanfall already and... It was fun.
[93:20.11]But I don't really want to drop like 60 bucks on a game that I'm certain I won't play for more than a day or two.
[93:26.45]Is this the boss already?
[93:29.07]Looks like it.
[93:32.33]This looks like a boss area.
[93:34.73]Hello.
[93:40.67]Oh, shit.
[93:41.77]No, okay, it just is the... No, yeah, please cast in the fucking other direction, buddy.
[93:52.83]Doesn't really do much damage, does it?
[93:58.16]Wait a minute.
[94:01.90]What else do you do?
[94:02.96]Does it hurt if I go up your ass?
[94:08.29]Well, you know, I'm sure it does.
[94:09.43]I'm sure it does if I go up your ass.
[94:14.73]What's this bell for?
[94:15.93]Bell?
[94:16.37]Ring the bell.
[94:23.06]Alright, he needs to like smash his head on the belt.
[94:27.22]Dude, if this is like a regular Nintendo game, that's what you have to get him to do.
[94:29.84]He needs to hit his head on the belt.
[94:31.52]He's gonna go... And he's gonna go... Can I cheese the fuck out of this guy?
[94:42.99]I think I really might be able to.
[94:49.27]I might be able to.
[94:50.45]Depends on how fast I can get up there.
[94:54.57]Oh, I can't do it fast enough.
[94:58.81]Although he is kind of just stuck there.
[95:02.03]There he goes.
[95:04.05]Alright, hit your head on the bell.
[95:06.93]Hit your head on the bell!
[95:11.20]Come on!
[95:12.02]I needed to go... I'm going to roll off this cliff.
[95:18.62]Guaranteed.
[95:25.51]Did he do the ding?
[95:32.63]Hey, I guaranteed it.
[95:35.51]I told you.
[95:41.78]That's gotta be a thing.
[95:42.78]He hits his head on the bell and he goes, oh boy, my head hurts.
[95:47.80]Sub only.
[95:48.30]Is it in sub only right now?
[95:52.52]I told you, I guaranteed it, and it happened.
[95:55.30]You don't get a guarantee from me unless it's actually going to happen.
[95:59.28]Okay, so I don't even... whatever.
[96:02.26]Let's just kill this guy.
[96:03.18]I'm going to use my new Super Dragon Breath on him.
[96:13.23]How much damage does the Super Dragon Breath do?
[96:16.99]Oh, that move is awful against this guy.
[96:21.73]pull the splinter out of his foot.
[96:24.49]Look, they wouldn't have a giant... Fuck, what else is over here?
[96:30.58]Why is there a guy here?
[96:33.84]What the hell is this guy doing here?
[96:38.76]Why are there all these guys here?
[96:42.10]Why are all these guys here?
[96:46.82]Um...
[96:52.86]I don't understand this.
[96:54.46]I feel like this is something going on here.
[96:56.12]I'm just going to look around.
[97:08.65]The ancient wyvern.
[97:10.53]There's another one.
[97:20.63]Dude, I bet you a thousand bucks.
[97:24.45]Well, no.
[97:25.01]Not a thousand bucks, but... He's, like, climbing around the tower.
[97:28.33]He's gonna smash his head and just go... Ding!
[97:32.19]Block the fire.
[97:32.75]Yes.
[97:40.31]So we just climb the tower together, and then eventually I shoot him with a giant arrow, and he goes... And falls down all the way.
[97:52.03]Be wary of above.
[97:52.83]I know be wary of above.
[98:01.62]I'm sure.
[98:02.26]I'm certain of it.
[98:07.54]I definitely have to come up here.
[98:08.66]There's no way this would be here.
[98:14.22]This is just like Donkey Kong.
[98:15.36]I'm going to get to the top and he's going to fall off.
[98:22.68]Okay.
[98:25.28]I'm at the top.
[98:27.84]Sort of.
[98:28.12]Oh my god, will you fuck off?
[98:35.15]Nice dodge.
[98:44.73]Where is it?
[98:46.83]It's just over there.
[98:50.06]Baby conceived successfully.
[98:51.99]That's two months.
[98:54.53]Baby conceived in two months.
[98:56.99]What is he doing?
[98:57.67]He's not doing anything.
[99:00.92]You know what's up here?
[99:03.36]Up here is going to be a huge guy that's going to kill me.
[99:12.11]Mistakes were made!
[99:15.45]Come on down here, you fucking idiot.
[99:17.23]It doesn't stagger him when you do that, but it's okay.
[99:25.75]I'm gonna, this is gonna be a... Alright, what happened in the Bilbo Baggins movie?
[99:30.93]There's a huge bow and arrow that's gonna be up here, and I'm gonna shoot him once, and he's gonna die.
[99:35.45]Oh, it's gonna feel so good, too.
[99:37.77]I'm gonna top myself off.
[99:41.04]Oh, hi.
[99:42.48]Hello there.
[99:50.58]Have I beaten the Chicago Cubs yet?
[99:54.00]I have not.
[99:54.48]I'm running out of mana by the time I get over there.
[100:02.64]Little huge guy.
[100:08.36]I'm doing this right, right?
[100:12.59]Listen, I'm doing this correct.
[100:16.29]I hope so.
[100:19.46]Oh, no.
[100:20.18]Here it comes.
[100:21.40]You know what?
[100:21.68]I'm going to get this one ready.
[100:24.80]I'm just going to charge it up and crush this guy.
[100:31.81]Lock on, lock on, lock on, please.
[100:35.61]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[100:37.29]I saw the dragon move.
[100:42.93]Hey, yeah.
[100:48.97]I'm running.
[100:49.91]Run.
[100:50.37]Just run, just run, just run, just run.
[100:54.09]Run across the chasm!
[100:56.63]I can hear the fire spreading!
[101:03.85]Huh?
[101:07.85]This is another... There's a ladder.
[101:09.11]There's a ladder.
[101:12.61]Leave with the fucking ladder!
[101:16.73]He's up here.
[101:18.23]I see his head.
[101:25.41]Huh?
[101:27.47]Wow.
[101:30.12]Wait a minute.
[101:31.66]No, um... Can I jump on his head?
[101:37.90]Can I jump down on his head?
[101:40.20]Fuck.
[101:41.08]I think I can jump on his head and instantly kill him, right?
[101:46.91]Okay, I gotta be prepared for this.
[101:48.77]Come here, you motherfucker!
[102:03.87]I did it!
[102:06.17]I got him first try!
[102:13.79]That was really the first try.
[102:22.20]Okay, I figured it out.
[102:27.80]Yeah, that just did like 7,000 damage to him.
[102:29.66]Not a big deal.
[102:35.51]Thanks, Phoenix.
[102:38.97]Only 18,000 souls?
[102:40.33]No way.
[102:40.91]It hasn't updated yet.
[102:41.95]Okay, good.
[102:43.41]70,000.
[102:43.43]Did I get a soul for killing him?
[102:54.01]What do you get for actually killing that guy?
[103:01.79]Hey, didn't even need any help on that one.
[103:08.97]I missed the part where you explained why you look like a tall Dobby.
[103:16.66]I gotta go back.
[103:22.25]Oh, wait.
[103:22.71]Did somebody put it in sub mode because somebody was going to tell me how to do it?
[103:26.61]And someone was going to tell me just to go run up and jump on them?
[103:31.82]I guess it makes sense.
[103:32.66]Welcome back, guys.
[103:34.48]But thank you, Phoenix, for the 500 bits, too.
[103:36.26]That's much appreciated.
[103:39.62]And Red Luigi for eight months.
[103:40.74]Thanks, Red Luigi.
[103:44.22]Use the dragon headstone.
[103:45.42]What does that even do?
[103:49.78]Where is it?
[103:54.44]Gain dragon head and emit dragon breath.
[103:59.20]Gain dragon torso and roar like a dragon.
[104:05.75]I can't use it.
[104:11.55]You missed stuff.
[104:13.11]Well, I'm going to go level up first.
[104:14.09]I'll come back.
[104:19.38]That was really fun.
[104:21.60]Not slightly terrifying.
[104:26.57]I've actually seen people wear this.
[104:27.85]You turn into a weird... You turn into a terrifying looking creature.
[104:35.98]It's like a shark dragon.
[104:39.58]I think I can upgrade something here.
[104:41.18]Yeah, I can.
[104:45.89]I hate this.
[104:49.77]Should I even do that or should I just upgrade my crystal claws?
[104:59.09]I don't even know.
[105:01.25]The amount of spell buff I get for this is just terrible.
[105:05.55]One extra spell buff.
[105:15.22]I feel like I'll get more use out of just upgrading this again.
[105:19.14]Get this to plus nine.
[105:24.18]I could do both, yeah.
[105:26.66]No, let's do it.
[105:28.62]And do this.
[105:33.71]Hey, look at that.
[105:34.31]I gained one spell buff.
[105:35.55]Isn't that cool?
[105:40.09]We're going to get a permanent facecam?
[105:47.58]No, no permanent face cams.
[105:49.90]I need endurance.
[105:53.68]Bad.
[106:00.03]I'm going to sell some shit, too.
[106:09.87]Actually, I could probably level up again with those.
[106:13.58]I have a couple of Crunch Berries to use.
[106:18.58]How many do I need? 38,000.
[106:26.76]I'm always crying.
[106:27.50]That's why I didn't use facecam.
[106:28.54]Eh, close enough.
[106:34.06]31,000.
[106:34.12]Can I get there?
[106:34.98]Hopefully I can get there with just these.
[106:36.32]Ooh, it's going to be close, but I should get it on this one.
[106:44.75]I believe that's enough.
[106:45.43]Alright.
[106:59.77]You can sell the souls for the same value.
[107:01.29]Ah, that's right.
[107:01.96]I guess you can.
[107:03.96]Alright.
[107:04.42]Let's keep exploring that area.
[107:08.76]Favorite place to wipe boogers?
[107:13.86]Easy on a tissue, man.
[107:21.69]What haven't I done?
[107:23.47]Well, I beat Dark Souls 3 a long time ago at launch.
[107:27.77]I streamed the whole thing.
[107:30.40]And this character is just kind of a shitty, dumb, goofy character I made that's pretty much strictly sorcery.
[107:38.39]And I have never seen this area.
[107:40.49]I'm doing it for the first time ever right now.
[107:48.34]There's a lot of summoning signs here.
[107:59.48]These dragons are so creepy looking.
[108:01.82]Oh, hi.
[108:04.00]Okay.
[108:05.96]Is this a... Who is this?
[108:07.38]Is this an NPC or is this a player?
[108:11.85]No, this is definitely an NPC.
[108:20.47]Bye-bye.
[108:24.43]Breakblood Greatsword.
[108:26.09]What on Earth is that?
[108:28.84]Hold on a second.
[108:29.48]I hear more things.
[108:30.22]I hear noises.
[108:30.84]Here comes another guy.
[108:37.08]Why are these guys all just appearing here?
[108:42.61]Oh, that thing hurts.
[108:44.39]Big time.
[108:44.95]How many of these guys might... Is this like a farming spot?
[108:51.07]Am I just going to farm these dudes?
[108:52.19]Oh, there's somebody ringing the bell.
[108:57.35]Somebody's ringing a bell.
[109:01.55]What is that?
[109:02.88]Who's doing this?
[109:04.74]That's not it.
[109:05.24]I'm very confused.
[109:13.88]Oh, no.
[109:14.20]Somebody's bringing him back to life.
[109:21.86]Kill that guy first.
[109:28.02]It's you doing that, isn't it?
[109:33.12]Oh my god.
[109:34.14]You ugly son of a bitch.
[109:46.41]Where is he?
[109:48.71]Where are you?
[109:51.33]Mr. Guy.
[109:52.15]I'll kill you.
[109:56.01]That was so enthusiastic.
[109:59.78]Where'd he go?
[110:02.54]There he is.
[110:04.96]Can I reach from over here with the snake?
[110:07.73]This tunnel snake?
[110:10.01]No.
[110:19.22]Oh, that is very easy to dodge.
[110:32.04]Alright, now he should be down for the count.
[110:43.17]No, well, he died.
[110:45.83]A great heavy soul arrow is so insane.
[110:56.21]Now, somebody said I missed something back here, which I want to see what it was.
[111:07.97]That's a little slow.
[111:13.22]Told you that bell was something.
[111:14.52]Somebody's digging it right now.
[111:37.90]I just went over his head.
[111:40.88]Out of mana.
[111:43.32]I need more mana.
[111:47.54]Cobblestone?
[111:49.64]They did it?
[111:50.14]Hold on.
[111:52.24]Cobblestone.
[111:52.62]That means I have to do a face reveal.
[111:54.06]I need to go back here.
[112:02.11]I can't believe they actually won.
[112:04.63]It's been like 200 years.
[112:06.16]So what did I miss?
[112:13.16]This over here, right?
[112:15.44]Yeah, because I fell down there.
[112:19.35]Why don't you show us your face?
[112:20.21]We miss your sweaty face.
[112:27.97]Hey, I found the thing that I missed.
[112:34.55]Twinkling Titan Eye.
[112:35.29]That seems to be... Seems to be it.
[112:39.35]Although... Eh.
[112:43.24]Nah.
[112:44.90]Alright, hold on.
[112:45.44]Face reveal.
[112:46.66]I'm gonna do a face reveal right now.
[112:49.32]Cubs won.
[112:51.32]It's time to reveal what my face looks like.
[112:57.16]The first time in 300 years.
[113:06.76]We've seen it before.
[113:07.80]Okay, here we go.
[113:23.69]Close your eyes.
[113:26.39]We're gonna do a real face reveal here.
[113:30.70]I can't point the camera down because I don't have any clothes on.
[113:33.62]I just have a t-shirt on.
[113:35.06]So yeah, you use your imagination, guys.
[113:45.29]Where is it?
[113:50.49]Oh, hold on.
[113:53.35]It's underneath this.
[114:09.42]Face reveal.
[114:11.06]For the first time ever.
[114:13.86]Crazy, I know, right?
[114:16.42]This is what I look like.
[114:17.16]This is my face.
[114:18.70]Kind of fucked up, right?
[114:19.54]I don't know.
[114:19.86]It's too bad.
[114:24.37]I look tired.
[114:26.39]I look like shit, huh?
[114:27.35]What do you think?
[114:32.73]Somebody's going to screen grab that one.
[114:36.05]Cubs win.
[114:36.99]Here's my face.
[114:38.03]You've never seen it again in the rest of your life.
[114:44.53]That is an air filter, you're right.
[114:46.25]And it's a heater.
[114:56.86]Enhance.
[114:57.52]Enhance.
[114:59.88]Wait, should I do a face stream?
[115:01.30]You think I should do that?
[115:02.68]Just go like this and play the game?
[115:05.32]Oh, now it's, like, all blurry.
[115:08.88]Let me fix that real quick.
[115:11.04]Hold on just a second.
[115:16.58]I look like my brother.
[115:17.44]I look a lot like my brother.
[115:20.08]Hey, give me a break.
[115:20.52]It's, like, one o'clock in the morning.
[115:21.60]It's not like I'm, like, ready to go out and look like I'm, like, worth anything.
[115:25.80]Oh, bits!
[115:26.46]Oh, you see those bits?
[115:28.10]Two hundred and fucking fifty thousand bits!
[115:32.04]Alright, for real, though.
[115:32.97]I'll see you later.
[115:34.05]Good talk.
[115:41.55]That was a good talk.
[115:46.65]Autocam?
[115:50.27]Not boring anymore?
[115:52.31]It's one o'clock in the morning.
[115:54.17]I've been up all day.
[115:58.43]Your brother's ugly.
[116:12.15]Hey, if I, like, did my hair and I, like, took a shower, I might look kind of decent, maybe.
[116:20.99]Nope, I just look like shit.
[116:25.44]Can you imagine, like, my face reaction when I, like, fucking fall off the cliff?
[116:42.69]Okay, I think I did get the stuff I needed to get here.
[116:49.01]Why would I dye my hair?
[116:50.01]What are you talking about?
[116:54.43]I'm not going gray just yet.
[116:57.61]I don't think I can get back up.
[116:59.76]I'm just going to homeward bone.
[117:00.62]I missed some epic loot I did.
[117:08.32]Here's some money.
[117:08.82]Please don't show your face again.
[117:10.20]Okay.
[117:15.26]Yeah, based on my Dark Souls character, this is my real face.
[117:24.50]I might have enough to level up again.
[117:40.26]Dime I hear green and shout all the time, I'll be famous?
[117:44.52]I don't want to be famous.
[117:48.48]I don't want to be famous, man.
[117:50.84]Well, now I brought this guy back to life.
[117:55.19]Brought this guy back to life.
[117:59.71]What?
[118:01.09]Don't!
[118:05.56]Can I sneak through the window here and shoot him?
[118:13.10]I hate you, game.
[118:14.28]Why do you do that to me?
[118:16.34]Why do you lose lock-on like that?
[118:18.51]Oh, hello.
[118:21.85]Welcome to the party.
[118:30.64]That was really risky and it didn't pay off.
[118:44.24]You have a one million souls character cam.
[118:47.04]Hey, Onion.
[118:48.30]Thanks for the resub eight months, Onion.
[118:52.73]Where's our auto cam?
[118:56.03]There's a sub that came in.
[118:57.39]Frozen Freight?
[118:59.83]Freight 7 Railroad?
[119:02.38]I don't know what your name is.
[119:03.92]I'm gonna call you Freight.

[119:43.91]Did I go down here?
[119:44.65]I don't think I even went over here.
[119:52.96]Did I?
[119:53.26]Whoa!
[119:56.24]They meant that left.
[120:05.64]It doesn't really suck that much in PvE.
[120:08.42]No, it's great for these situations.
[120:10.12]When you're actually fighting regular enemies, it's really great.
[120:16.79]But fighting bosses... Especially ones that move around a shitload... You're in a bad spot.
[120:35.90]222.
[120:35.92]Come on, put that shield down, buddy, and we'll see what happens.
[120:49.20]The next boss is really easy.
[120:53.03]I'm going to call... Bullsnip on that one.
[120:57.39]Oh, okay.
[120:58.05]Is there anything else over here?

[121:58.39]There's a really big guy over here.
[122:01.71]Don't worry.
[122:02.15]I'll take out this guy in one second.
[122:04.18]Check it out.
[122:05.58]Great heavy soul arrow!
[122:07.32]It missed.
[122:10.18]Of course it did.
[122:10.76]Probably could have backstabbed it right there by a little piece of crap.
[122:17.47]I gotta run in here.
[122:19.71]I need a nice long hallway.
[122:37.08]I'm almost out of mana.
[122:44.77]Look, we don't die today.
[122:49.02]We done die today.
[122:50.02]I feel like I'm just kind of backtracking for no reason.
[122:58.74]Yeah, I am.
[123:05.92]Although, I feel like I did miss some shit.
[123:09.39]Yeah, I knew it.
[123:10.09]I missed a cookie bug.
[123:18.43]I missed that, too.
[123:19.13]Whatever the hell that is.
[123:21.69]And a chest over here.
[123:22.69]There's a lot of shit that I missed.
[123:24.17]Good thing I decided to do this.
[123:29.56]Ah, just out of reach.
[123:30.46]Can I jump to it?
[123:31.78]Of course not.
[123:34.59]I hear something.
[123:39.21]I hear something.
[123:43.81]Mean chest?
[123:47.90]Don't lie to me, game.
[123:49.68]Is this a mimic?
[123:54.36]It's not.
[124:00.39]Well, I got some stuff.
[124:05.53]Do you remember your thumbnail as your face reveal?
[124:07.54]Is it really?
[124:08.06]God, I look like shit, dude.
[124:10.94]I always look like shit.
[124:12.84]Oh, hold on.
[124:13.72]Easy.
[124:14.94]Easy.
[124:15.54]That guy blended in with the environment.
[124:17.00]Not fair.
[124:17.46]This armadillo.
[124:19.78]I'm one of those people that always just feel like I look like shit every day unless I try to look decent.
[124:33.96]If I try to look decent, I usually look okay.
[124:38.48]Just like on a whim.
[124:41.09]Kind of look like a fucking dumbass.
[124:43.93]Easy now.
[124:44.51]Why am I putting myself down?
[124:50.59]I'm not putting myself down.
[124:51.49]Oh, please.
[124:55.19]Really?
[124:55.51]I just killed you.
[124:59.08]I just beat you.
[125:00.90]You can't be back.
[125:02.82]I already won.
[125:03.62]I don't think I can go this way.
[125:13.90]I already beat this guy.
[125:15.14]Get it and run!
[125:29.91]Jump on his head.
[125:30.63]I could.
[125:33.68]Alright, what is this guy?
[125:34.42]I just want this guy to come up.
[125:35.66]Let's see what this guy does.
[125:40.35]I'm going to follow this guy's lead.
[125:41.69]Because I'm out of mana potions, so I need to just cheese him for 30 minutes.
[125:46.93]That would be true if I had any mana potions.
[125:48.69]I don't.
[125:50.47]I want to just summon this guy.
[125:51.59]I'm just curious what this guy does.
[125:52.72]Alright, what are you going to do?
[125:56.68]You're on camera.
[125:58.52]Do something funny.
[126:00.84]Alright, that was pretty funny.
[126:02.92]That was pretty funny.
[126:05.10]Alright, go get this dragon now.
[126:10.16]You kill this dragon.
[126:11.02]I'm not killing the dragon.
[126:12.94]Oh, he's not even here.
[126:15.52]Yeah, he is.
[126:16.88]Did we run?
[126:17.28]Did we just go?
[126:18.68]We just go.
[126:20.20]We just go.
[126:20.74]We just go all the way up before he lands.
[126:24.60]Wow!
[126:26.95]There's so many armadillos up here.
[126:31.58]And there's like a random fucking... Really?
[126:33.82]Get out of the fucking way.
[126:36.72]Get out of the way, dude.
[126:38.18]Come on.
[126:41.06]They're really gonna fight this guy again?
[126:42.46]Where's my buddy?
[126:47.24]Where's Minotaur?
[126:55.78]He just scared the shit out of me.
[126:57.14]Alright, you gotta get this guy.
[126:59.02]This guy's been a thorn in my side.
[127:05.30]I'm just wasting mana right now.
[127:06.76]Is there something else I could do?
[127:09.32]Easy.
[127:10.44]Easy.
[127:13.44]Alright.
[127:20.06]Beware.
[127:20.88]God, he's... Come on.
[127:26.38]This is just such a disadvantage right now.
[127:29.82]We're getting shot at by the stupid pulse queen up there.
[127:36.38]I just picked up the moonlit greatsword.
[127:37.74]It was on the ground.
[127:43.28]What the fuck is that thing?
[127:47.65]Watch out behind you!
[127:50.29]I'm dead.
[127:50.57]Fuck.
[127:51.85]God damn it.
[128:07.30]The invader left that?
[128:08.68]Are you serious?
[128:15.49]Why?
[128:17.05]Why?
[128:17.65]I'm never going to use it.
[128:20.80]KFO, that could be a hacked item.
[128:22.34]Are you kidding me?
[128:23.62]Is it?
[128:24.10]I don't think it looks.
[128:24.70]It doesn't look like it is.
[128:32.86]Yeah, I could use it.
[128:33.80]But I need to put 16 points into strength.
[128:35.70]I have 10 strength right now.
[128:39.33]Alright, I'm summoning.
[128:40.51]You know what?
[128:41.23]Two people put your signs down here.
[128:43.59]I ain't gonna let that shit happen again.
[128:47.73]Just come up here and put your signs down.
[128:49.23]We're going as a pack of wolves.
[128:53.15]Can I two-hand it?
[128:53.89]Can I?
[128:57.85]Where is it right there?
[129:12.08]Doesn't this thing use moon powers and shit?
[129:16.72]Can I just not use the ability because I don't have the proficiency?
[129:22.66]I thought this thing shot out laser beams.
[129:27.98]Am I crazy?
[129:34.94]I need more strength.
[129:35.68]Yeah, whatever.
[129:46.05]Alright, we're rolling as a team now.
[130:01.10]Shoots moonbeams, does it?
[130:02.70]That's cool.
[130:04.74]Alright, Orion and Skeletor, you are my personal bodyguards.
[130:10.98]In order to make sure that I do not... I do not get killed by the invaders.
[130:23.66]Why is there a mist door over there?
[130:25.16]Why are there mist doors everywhere?
[130:34.67]What?
[130:36.31]I'm so confused right now.
[130:39.35]Can we just not leave this area now because there's two people here?
[130:42.21]Let's wait for the other guy.
[130:48.09]Come on up here.
[130:48.79]Oh, there he is.
[130:49.19]No, don't die.
[130:56.98]He's dead.
[130:57.86]Shit, this guy's dead already.
[130:59.04]Alright, who's next?
[131:00.62]Who else is going to play?
[131:03.76]Who else is playing with us?
[131:07.68]That guy got comboed.
[131:15.05]Put your sign down.
[131:16.81]Right here, if you want to play.
[131:21.03]I hope we get invaded.
[131:21.85]We're gonna 3v1.
[131:22.71]Oh, is this Skeeter from Doug?
[131:26.49]This guy has, like, the Skeeter skin.
[131:27.75]I want to be Skeeter.
[131:33.73]God, I made my character so dumb.
[131:45.79]Looking for a sign.
[131:49.37]Anybody wants to play?
[131:52.23]Hey, look at that.
[131:53.06]There's a couple here.
[131:54.10]My game almost just crashed.
[131:56.44]Orion, I'm going to have to pick the next guy.
[131:58.00]I'll pick Dorp this time.
[132:01.76]Whoa, that's a cool sword.
[132:04.49]Nothing against Orion.
[132:05.57]It's just I want to get different people in if I can.
[132:12.24]You can change it?
[132:13.38]No.
[132:14.58]I will always have.
[132:15.54]He has a mustache, too.
[132:20.42]Look at that skin mustache.
[132:24.91]Alright, door.
[132:25.89]Alright, let's go.
[132:28.85]Hello.
[132:29.71]Thanks for the moonlit greatsword, whoever the invader gave it to me.
[132:34.43]I got that already, and then we... I kind of don't even know where the hell I'm going now.
[132:39.28]This way, right?
[132:42.03]Hello.
[132:44.11]Be wary of left.
[132:47.93]Alright, you guys go.
[132:51.83]I want to watch your guy's skills.
[132:53.65]Why is this guy not a phantom?
[132:57.02]He's just a guy.
[133:02.54]Alright, wait, wait.
[133:03.90]I'm going to summon this guy and we're going to fucking destroy him instantly.
[133:06.74]No, no, no.
[133:08.58]I want my 40,000 souls.
[133:08.92]I'm not doing that.
[133:14.12]Dude, we got two sorcerers in the house.
[133:15.80]Nice.
[133:18.37]We're like the two casters.
[133:19.43]They're the ranged DPS and he's the tank.
[133:24.35]I like playing Dark soulslike an MMO.
[133:26.07]It's fun.
[133:26.47]Alright, if any gear drops, I'm gonna roll on it.
[133:37.14]Hopefully cloth drops, man.
[133:42.39]Dark Souls is so much more fun with friends.
[133:44.41]Hey, well, okay, I'll get this guy this time.
[133:45.79]I'm not gonna fuck it up.
[133:47.93]I fucked it up again.
[133:49.01]I fucked it up again.
[133:49.73]I don't even know how it's possible for you to fuck this up again, and I'm gonna die.
[133:54.59]Please, thank you.
[133:56.04]Wrong potion!
[133:59.04]I can't believe it.
[133:59.94]I can't believe I almost fucked it up again.
[134:01.46]It's like the easiest thing in the world, and I can't do it for some reason.
[134:19.93]Nice.
[134:22.93]I can't fucking do it.
[134:25.39]I don't know why.
[134:26.55]What's wrong with me?
[134:27.45]I already did everything over here.
[134:31.70]No, no, no he didn't.
[134:32.92]This is where I died.
[134:33.48]This is where we got invaded before.
[134:37.62]Saved by the tank.
[134:38.74]Yeah, he taunted him.
[134:39.62]He got aggroed.
[134:42.40]Thank you, Kuzku, for your subscription.
[134:44.52]Welcome, dude.
[134:45.80]Thank you guys for the bits as well.
[134:47.02]Some people gave 100.
[134:47.52]Alright, where did I die?
[134:49.34]It was somewhere around here, right?
[134:52.03]No, we have to run through.
[134:53.19]Oh, boy.
[134:53.83]Okay.
[134:55.13]Be careful.
[134:57.67]Get rid of the armadillos.
[135:08.70]Here comes Mr. Fire.
[135:12.92]And three, two, one, go.
[135:20.06]Didn't work.
[135:21.38]That didn't work.
[135:24.96]Are we fighting him?
[135:25.38]We're just going to fight his legs?
[135:28.04]He's going to stomp us.
[135:29.36]He's going to stomp us.
[135:32.27]He's just stomping me repeatedly.
[135:36.85]We're not actually going to do it like this, are we?
[135:40.86]What are we doing?
[135:41.68]He has so much health.
[135:45.16]What a fucking mistake.
[135:46.78]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[135:51.82]That is such a huge... Just a pincushion.
[136:00.78]Get me out of here.
[136:01.50]I don't have health potions.
[136:04.48]Oh no, no.
[136:06.18]Make it out.
[136:09.08]My god.
[136:15.45]This guy wants to fight us so bad right here?
[136:17.37]Alright, when did I die?
[136:18.75]It was up here.
[136:19.71]There it is.
[136:23.82]Who the fuck is this?
[136:26.42]Who's this?
[136:27.82]Fuck this guy.
[136:28.42]He's dead.
[136:32.02]Fuck this naked king.
[136:33.28]Alright, we're gonna... Is he dead?
[136:38.52]Kill the Resurrector.
[136:40.16]Alright, we're good.
[136:41.12]We're good.
[136:41.52]We're good.
[136:41.76]We're good.
[136:48.74]What's up here?
[136:52.06]Nothing.
[136:55.26]Where's the skip?
[136:55.78]There's gotta be a skip somewhere, right?
[137:00.94]What's this thing do?
[137:03.54]Nothing will remain.
[137:04.26]The bell is tolled.
[137:05.07]Visions of a liar.
[137:05.99]What should I do, skater?
[137:07.49]Should I pull this skater?
[137:21.63]I told you guys you had to ring the bell.
[137:23.11]I almost missed the bonfire.
[137:31.05]That would have been bad.
[137:41.33]Did I do something wrong?
[137:47.09]I already have the torso stone.
[137:55.03]What the hell is going on?
[137:58.94]Thanks, NudSuffy.
[137:59.80]What did I do wrong?
[138:00.70]Uh, okay.
[138:13.47]The world is now a dark cloud.
[138:18.01]This area has been great.
[138:19.21]I love this area.
[138:21.39]I didn't even play it the first playthrough.
[138:24.16]Alright.
[138:25.32]I'm fine.
[138:25.84]Look, all I did is make the ground all misty.
[138:34.38]There's a bonfire.
[138:39.48]Alright, I can't rest at this, can I?
[138:42.70]No.
[138:45.96]I have 66,000 souls.
[138:47.24]I kind of want to get out of here and go do this.
[138:50.13]I would like to turn these souls in.
[139:03.12]Ooh, crestfallen knight.
[139:09.15]These guys are pointing me around like it's some kind of treasure hunt.
[139:12.60]Hold on.
[139:12.96]Make sure I don't miss anything over here.
[139:27.11]Mimic mimic okay, no mimic Alright, yeah, I think I'm gonna have to unsummon you guys I have way too many souls I would feel terrible if I lost them These guys like to guides I
[139:50.35]Go up here.
[139:50.97]Head up the stairs.
[139:54.25]Wait a minute.
[139:55.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[139:55.94]This is a boss area.
[139:58.18]Go back down.
[140:00.82]Go down.
[140:01.68]I don't want to do... No, go down.
[140:03.76]Get out of the way.
[140:07.08]I don't want to fight the boss right now.
[140:09.90]This is definitely the boss area.
[140:16.09]Alright, I'm going to have to banish you guys.
[140:19.03]No, that's not a boss.
[140:19.79]Okay.
[140:22.42]Cloudy, perfect gaming weather.
[140:25.12]I thought this guy was the boss for a second.
[140:27.14]I was about to be disappointed.
[140:31.87]Well, you don't take damage.
[140:39.49]God, this guy has a billion resistances.
[140:43.81]Well, I'm useless now.
[140:45.29]Good luck, everybody.
[140:48.23]Oh, shit.
[140:48.83]He killed Skeeter.
[140:51.63]Why did you bring me up here?
[140:57.67]Titanite's... Oh, that's the Titanite's lab.
[140:59.61]Yeah!
[141:01.83]Yeah!
[141:03.26]Yeah!
[141:06.28]What the heck?
[141:08.06]Get him with the bake tape.
[141:13.14]I'm so useless right now.
[141:13.98]I'm so sorry.
[141:14.49]I mean, I can do this.
[141:16.15]There's a guy throwing at him.
[141:24.07]I take one big hit and I'm dead.
[141:28.63]Come on, Dorp.
[141:29.14]There you go.
[141:30.20]Alright, Dorp.
[141:34.90]You're going to have to fight this guy.
[141:37.33]Because I can't risk losing 70,000 souls right now.
[141:40.35]You have to be the hero.
[141:47.77]Get away from me.
[141:49.59]Get away.
[141:50.23]He's gonna turn and kill me.
[141:52.33]No.
[141:53.61]I need a guaranteed opportunity to get him with a back step.
[141:58.04]Nice work.
[141:59.76]Nice work.
[142:01.28]This is when I come in for a back step.
[142:08.42]Don't stop!
[142:10.28]Nice work.
[142:11.86]Wow.
[142:12.36]Very good.
[142:14.22]That was a good boss.
[142:15.00]We beat the boss.
[142:17.72]Dragon Tooth?
[142:19.23]Okay.
[142:22.25]Alright.
[142:24.47]I'm going back to the bonfire.
[142:25.69]I want to drink up first.
[142:28.59]You know what I'm saying?
[142:30.66]So, it was a pleasure.
[142:32.62]But I'm going to use my banishing crystal.
[142:37.76]Oh, he's already gone.
[142:39.16]Okay, cool.
[142:41.44]Yeah.
[142:42.65]I'm going to Homeward Bone because I'm a moron and will die somehow.
[142:45.57]For somehow I will die.
[142:47.49]Positive.
[142:54.25]Co-hopped the shit out of him.
[142:55.43]That was the plan.
[142:58.08]I have a lot of stuff.
[143:01.72]Alright, let's see here.
[143:10.22]It's going to take me... It's going to take like half a million souls for me to get 16 strength.
[143:18.36]I can't even do it at this point.
[143:21.81]It's going on Evo Sigma.
[143:22.73]Thanks for nine months, dude.
[143:30.13]I am not going to co-op a boss.
[143:31.41]I'm going to try it at least once or twice by myself.
[143:35.60]Probably going to lose.
[143:36.62]But, you know.
[143:38.08]This is something I have not seen so far.
[143:40.18]So, why not?
[143:45.37]Need only a little bit more.
[143:51.91]Alright.
[143:58.07]Let's give it a try.
[144:00.11]See if I can't fight this bad guy.
[144:09.14]Trust me, it's an easy boss.
[144:12.68]Only level strength once.
[144:17.34]Yeah, but I really think I'm desperate at this moment.
[144:20.26]At this moment.
[144:21.78]At this moment.
[144:23.18]For, um... Something other than, uh... Can't even talk.
[144:31.97]I'm desperate at this moment for endurance and vigor.
[144:36.03]This character is such a piece of shit.
[144:37.47]He needs it bad.
[144:45.32]Alright, is there like a better entrance, or do I just kind of run up this way, or where is this guy?
[144:50.89]Where is this guy?
[144:52.25]Or was I just kind of going the right way when we went up the ladder?
[144:55.95]I'm going to assume it's up there.
[144:56.95]It kind of has to be, right?
[145:01.32]Hey, Chaotic of Doom, thanks for the sub, and thank you Lazalik for two months.
[145:05.96]Shrug?
[145:08.08]Shrug.
[145:09.64]Appreciate the two months.
[145:12.50]Much love, dude.
[145:14.89]That can hit more than one person.
[145:16.09]Holy shit, he came off on me quick.
[145:21.15]He came off on me very quick.
[145:28.38]Did not expect him to be that fast.
[145:34.88]What's up here though?
[145:37.62]All those little dummy enemies.
[145:46.26]What?
[145:49.66]Y'all saw that.
[145:50.56]That was dumb.
[145:51.52]What is this guy?
[145:52.28]What the fuck are these guys coming from?
[145:56.64]Are you serious?
[145:57.96]There's like fucking 30 people up here.
[146:07.95]Oh my god.
[146:08.93]I'm dead.
[146:10.43]I'm dead.
[146:15.82]There's like 15 fucking people up there.
[146:17.97]I'm just running.
[146:23.57]Don't you know the strategy in Dark Souls?
[146:25.09]You don't have to fight any fucking enemies.
[146:26.47]You just run.
[146:27.63]Just sprint by everything and just open the boss door.
[146:37.45]Croc is shit.
[146:40.04]Oh my god.
[146:40.86]I fucking hate these guys.
[146:42.54]So much.
[146:46.69]Oh boy, and there's an armadillo.
[146:56.02]There's an armadillo around that ledge.
[147:00.98]We're going in sub only mode to stop the potential leakage of information.
[147:11.92]I'm getting that item.
[147:15.05]It's only 11, like 12, 13,000.
[147:16.47]Who cares?
[147:24.58]Death.
[147:24.88]I'm guaranteed.
[147:25.36]I'm dead.
[147:26.28]Ooh, new ashes.
[147:31.16]No way I dodged it.
[147:32.52]I dodged it, man.
[147:34.87]Get.
[147:36.69]Get.
[147:37.75]Out.
[147:37.95]Out.
[147:42.56]And with one swing of this, why are there so many of these fucking things?
[147:49.86]Why are there so many of them?
[147:53.46]There's so many of them.
[147:55.48]There's too many of them.
[147:57.92]There's so many of them, they can't even fit through the door.
[148:02.27]You fucking dumb game.
[148:05.99]Get out of the way, man.
[148:07.61]I have to check the other side, too.
[148:10.23]There's something else over here, probably.
[148:13.55]Nope.
[148:14.31]Nothing over here.
[148:15.15]Whoa!
[148:19.50]Did you see that one?
[148:20.72]I went flying.
[148:27.08]Fucking Dark Souls, man.
[148:31.38]What a bag of shit.
[148:36.62]What am I doing up the slate?
[148:37.52]That's a good question.
[148:38.22]I was only going to stream for like an hour.
[148:39.44]I'm going on like two or three hours now.
[148:44.12]In the front door.
[148:45.70]Stamina build.
[148:47.02]Dodge.
[148:48.14]Oh my god, I hate everything.
[148:54.09]Alright.
[148:56.33]I gotta say.
[148:58.09]What the fuck is this room?
[149:05.28]Somebody at FromSoftware got drunk and put too many enemies in this circle.
[149:11.83]Thank you, Mr. Krabs.
[149:18.25]And this guy can smell me.
[149:20.59]I don't even care about my souls.
[149:24.41]Dude, oh my fuck!
[149:30.98]Oh my...
[149:34.21]Is there a shortcut?
[149:35.01]No.
[149:35.43]This is just like where you fight Magus.
[149:40.08]Nothing up here.
[149:40.70]There's nothing here.
[149:46.24]What a fucking waste of time.
[149:50.14]Wait, do the dragon pose.
[149:52.62]Quick!
[149:57.26]Come on!
[149:59.32]Come on!
[150:01.88]Look, they're all doing it.
[150:11.11]There's really nothing here.
[150:14.42]Oh, my God.
[150:17.90]Come get me.
[150:20.06]You want to do it?
[150:21.46]I'm ready for you now.
[150:22.26]Come on.
[150:32.85]Where is he?
[150:35.21]He appeared over there.
[150:36.11]Okay, good luck, buddy.
[150:37.99]Let's take a... Let's watch.
[150:39.86]Have fun.
[150:41.43]Have fun coming through this piece of shit.
[150:46.57]Oh, I forgot it's Dark Souls.
[150:48.67]Enemies don't fight him.
[150:59.52]What are you doing?
[151:06.87]Get outta here!
[151:09.33]What is he doing?
[151:11.20]Is he healing himself?
[151:14.14]Yeah, you won't fight me on the edge of the universe.
[151:17.20]You won't fight me on the edge of the universe.
[151:19.14]I bet you won't.
[151:24.47]Come on.
[151:27.17]You want to go?
[151:27.83]Alright, I feel you.
[151:31.05]I see what your plan is.
[151:31.93]You want to go fisticuffs?
[151:34.21]Fists only?
[151:41.63]What a mistake that was.
[151:43.40]He's dropping shit on the ground.
[151:44.68]What is this?
[151:45.80]Knight's ring?
[151:46.42]What are you giving me?
[151:49.52]Don't give me these things.
[151:52.06]No, no, dude.
[151:55.49]What does this do?
[152:00.03]Johnny.
[152:01.87]He just gave me a ring.
[152:03.25]Knight's ring.
[152:04.03]What the hell is this?
[152:06.20]Increases...
[152:10.19]Dude just comes in and drops the strength ring and jumps off the fucking cliff.
[152:21.04]Alright, I'll take another free item, I guess.
[152:26.56]Thank you, dude.
[152:28.50]I thought you were going to try to come in here and troll me.
[152:34.37]Alright, two-handed.
[152:37.29]Whoa.
[152:48.81]Nice.
[152:49.43]That's cool.
[152:49.94]What's with the bell?
[152:57.50]So how much damage is this doing right now?
[153:00.18]130 plus 1.
[153:00.66]That's actually not too bad.
[153:01.92]Let's find out.
[153:09.07]Let's use it on one of these 200 enemies.
[153:12.33]Sit in front of the thing?
[153:13.17]I thought I did that.
[153:18.91]Wasn't that the whole purpose of me coming up here, was to do that?
[153:20.77]What the hell is that?
[153:33.68]Twinkling dragon torso stone?
[153:38.41]What are these things?
[153:40.03]I don't know.
[153:40.75]No, it's an item.
[153:51.51]Gain dragon torso in war until death.
[153:58.41]So what's the difference?
[154:02.03]Use it.
[154:02.31]I can't.
[154:20.04]I can't use it.
[154:26.59]I can't do anything about it, man.
[154:28.89]I wish.
[154:30.85]That's 130 plus 75.
[154:32.15]This is 107 plus 96.
[154:36.93]So that's 205.
[154:43.27]They're pretty much the same at this point.
[154:51.78]It's barely a difference.
[154:53.16]Just like whatever I think is cooler, apparently.
[154:57.99]Let's see how fun it is.
[155:03.11]I have to get naked?
[155:03.97]Ugh.
[155:06.33]Fine, I'm naked now.
[155:08.65]Oh, God!
[155:09.53]Alright, I'm naked.
[155:11.78]I'm gonna use the draw.
[155:13.04]Look, I'm a dragon.
[155:16.62]Cool.
[155:26.08]So what does this do?
[155:30.53]That's un-upgraded.
[155:31.51]Oh, fuck.
[155:32.75]That is un-upgraded.
[155:33.71]I don't understand what this is supposed to be.
[155:37.84]You just look like a seahorse.
[155:42.66]Use the other stone?
[155:43.62]Am I gonna look like a shitty seahorse or what?
[156:03.41]So now I'm like Super Dragon.
[156:10.05]Alright, let's go kick some ass.
[156:12.69]Watch this.
[156:13.87]What's up, boys?
[156:23.06]Yeah, you thought you could fuck with the Super Mario boss!
[156:25.94]Mario 64!
[156:33.43]When you go into the temple and you're gonna fight the guy's hands.
[156:35.83]Alright, let's upgrade this thing.
[156:54.51]Use the twinkling one again.
[156:55.89]Jesus, I just got her and you're already driving me insane.
[157:00.24]I've never even seen this shit before.
[157:01.84]I don't know what this stuff does.
[157:03.78]I don't even have any souls enough to even do anything with this shit.
[157:16.25]Alright, let's go.
[157:19.72]So, there's the mullet sword.
[157:21.70]I can do... I'll get this to 16.
[157:25.21]Holy shit.
[157:26.87]152 plus 94.
[157:28.43]Are you kidding me?
[157:30.28]Oh my god.
[157:36.30]Yeah, I'll upgrade it.
[157:38.10]Titanite scale.
[157:39.12]Oh my god, look at how much damage this thing is going to do.
[157:41.22]I need more Titanite scales though.
[157:51.25]But holy shit.
[157:53.76]That's crazy.
[157:54.48]It's going to do 216 plus 164.
[157:56.77]Yikes.
[157:57.37]I need more scales.
[158:04.75]Do I have enough to put one point in strength?
[158:07.29]Because I kind of want to.
[158:09.29]No, I don't.
[158:15.06]I'm running an end character?
[158:16.16]Yeah.
[158:17.92]It's pretty much just a sorcerer.
[158:22.70]So what does this actually do, stat-wise?
[158:24.81]Does this give me more stats?
[158:28.15]Or do I just look like a dragon and it's cool looking?
[158:29.91]Because this shoots like a fireball out of your mouth.
[158:40.31]And this one, you just go... I'm going to put them on the bar.
[158:47.30]I'm assuming they're necessary to be there.
[159:03.44]Alright.
[159:04.12]One more.
[159:05.46]I'm still going to check this king out.
[159:07.44]I have no idea where the hell he is.
[159:09.78]If I fight this king guy as the dragon, do I get extra points?
[159:17.81]Oh, I have a new bone.
[159:19.61]Charred thing.
[159:20.39]Ash thing.
[159:26.37]So what does that let me get?
[159:32.33]You can buy chunks.
[159:35.47]You can buy Titanite scale.
[159:37.45]Ooh.
[159:41.51]Ooh.
[159:44.53]Isn't that swell?
[159:54.55]Alright.
[159:56.49]Let's actually walk forward and fight boss.
[160:08.10]I need my... Staff.
[160:15.42]Can't really use this sword.
[160:17.98]I guess I can, but... Not really effectively.
[160:20.72]I have to two-hand it.
[160:22.10]Alright, which way am I going here?
[160:24.38]Am I going back this way?
[160:26.47]No.
[160:26.93]It was this way, right?
[160:28.97]Oh, my guy looks fucking cool.
[160:31.01]Huge moonlit sword and a staff in his left hand.
[160:33.67]I'm ready for anything.
[160:34.39]I'm like Gandalf the dragon.
[160:39.37]Straight down this way?
[160:42.71]We're here?
[160:45.47]No, yes, maybe.
[160:47.75]Cubs 1, yeah, late night stream.
[160:49.23]Yeah, just kind of playing on my sorcerer.
[160:56.55]Never have seen this area ever, so... That's why I decided to do it.
[161:04.57]Yeah, this is Gandalf, the moonlit seahorse.
[161:10.60]It's a pretty cool seahorse, if you ask me.
[161:19.30]Gotta go back to the bell.
[161:23.31]Just want to make sure I didn't miss stuff.
[161:27.21]Which I probably did.
[161:31.15]Well, alrighty.
[161:37.48]Here's the bell.
[161:41.52]Just, like, jump down?
[161:44.96]Looks like it.
[161:50.02]Okay.
[161:53.70]Uh... Looks like this is a big... Okay, fog door.
[161:57.99]Let's fight boss guy.
[161:59.81]I'm gonna fight Xavius.
[162:02.71]He's in the Emerald Nightmare.
[162:03.69]Alright.
[162:07.51]Hi.
[162:09.05]King of the Storm.
[162:15.22]Holy shit!
[162:17.21]I did it so... Okay, well, first two important things.
[162:21.19]I just did a shitload of damage in one cast to that bird.
[162:26.58]I instantly die, but we're learning.
[162:28.38]I might be able to do this.
[162:31.28]Hold on, I gotta cast my dragon spells.
[162:40.71]Yeah, you watch this one.
[162:44.35]This guy's going to be easy.
[162:47.75]That was a lot of damage.
[162:49.91]I know he's going to jump off.
[162:51.27]I'm going to kill the Seahawk.
[162:53.83]What's the meaning of Seahawk?
[162:59.86]Come on over.
[163:01.14]Come on over, baby.
[163:03.68]Come on over.
[163:06.14]Come on, get in here.
[163:09.86]Don't make the same mistake twice!
[163:11.00]I obviously need to put on lightning damage.
[163:18.55]You'll get one shot every time?
[163:19.77]Holy shit.
[163:21.79]That's not good to know.
[163:22.65]Maybe I shouldn't be dragon.
[163:30.05]Should I put on lightning resist or am I... Okay, that's such a very long cast.
[163:35.30]You take a long time to do that.
[163:39.28]It's going to be a long night.
[163:44.34]Alright, I can't get greedy.
[163:45.88]Just cast once and then get ready to dodge.
[163:53.76]I'm going to do a heavy soul arrow.
[163:57.92]Wait till he moves.
[163:59.54]That's a dumb idea.
[164:02.23]Okay.
[164:02.91]Got one.
[164:04.83]Two.
[164:05.49]Now let's just chill.
[164:07.65]Here he comes.
[164:08.71]Hi!
[164:15.28]What was that?
[164:16.78]What's he doing?
[164:18.98]Dude, this dude is Zeus, apparently.
[164:20.58]He's just casting lightning bolts down on a fucking... Wow, this guy is awesome!
[164:29.42]Can you hit him with one of these, please?
[164:32.05]Appreciate it.
[164:35.65]Oh!
[164:46.85]Holy fuck.
[164:50.13]I wish I could move, I wish I was a big boy!
[164:52.17]Why do I have music off?
[165:03.16]That music distracts me.
[165:05.38]Alright, I'm gonna take this off.
[165:09.21]Putting the shield on.
[165:11.85]Just for some extra lightning damage resistance.
[165:16.36]Something like this big ass thing.
[165:19.91]I'm holding this thing upside down.
[165:23.43]Don't summon a Luigi.
[165:24.39]I think I... Depending how... If I can get the... Dragons hate lightning.
[165:36.81]Am I screwing myself over here?
[165:38.46]32... Dude, no.
[165:43.60]I gotta put armor on.
[165:49.75]No, I want to take off the dragon costume.
[165:53.83]I'm going to return this shit to Best Buy, wherever I got it.
[165:59.51]Okay.
[166:00.89]Let's go.
[166:06.03]Where is it?
[166:06.47]Where is it?
[166:07.63]Lightning, lightning, lightning.
[166:09.25]There's big shield.
[166:11.13]82% lightning.
[166:12.51]83% lightning.
[166:28.04]This thing's too big though.
[166:28.96]I don't like it.
[166:30.18]Yeah, I like this dumb one.
[166:40.31]You don't need actual weapons when you're a spell sorcerer.
[166:51.14]I want health.
[166:54.64]Let's do it.
[166:57.36]Okay.
[166:59.20]Dragon caster.
[167:08.51]Seriously?
[167:09.59]I'm dead.
[167:13.09]I'm dead.
[167:13.64]I'm dead.
[167:16.74]I didn't even hit him and I lost.
[167:18.00]Come on now.
[167:18.60]Like, that shit is just dumb.
[167:21.38]He flew around in a fucking circle around me.
[167:26.52]Like, he flew around like, and I lost my lock-on.
[167:38.31]One thing that the Souls franchise has done terribly wrong is if there's an enemy in the game that, like, runs by you like that, the lock-on should whip you around.
[167:52.88]Like, if I'm locked onto a guy and he just, like,
[167:56.94]It's kind of dumb.
[168:07.22]Oh fuck, I don't want to even put this on.
[168:10.28]Don't get mad.
[168:10.94]I'm not getting mad.
[168:12.12]I'm stating an obvious fact.
[168:15.53]Of this stupid fucking franchise.
[168:18.43]One of the shittiest gaming franchises ever made.
[168:22.85]I'm going to just take a little bit and just dodge.
[168:24.73]Let's see.
[168:34.75]It's hard to gauge.
[168:35.55]I just want to get something close like this.
[168:42.93]Oh, that's a move that I didn't see you do.
[168:44.89]How am I not getting hit by that?
[168:46.82]I don't know.
[168:52.14]How did he dodge that?
[168:53.42]What?
[169:06.55]I was waiting.
[169:07.17]I mean, this guy's like super fucking cool.
[169:20.48]Jesus.
[169:26.83]Can't even see.
[169:28.43]Wait, hit him in the legs.
[169:30.11]No, not with the shield.
[169:31.09]Oh, great.
[169:32.49]You know, I would like to lock on to the giant fucking enemy that's standing next to me.
[169:37.96]That would be swell, Dark Souls.
[169:51.45]More than I've gotten him any time so far.
[169:56.98]Woo!
[170:00.94]I just freaked the fuck out.
[170:02.06]I didn't even know what the fuck happened.
[170:05.75]I just got terrified.
[170:06.83]Where's he going?
[170:15.42]Where is he?
[170:15.88]Lock on.
[170:16.56]Please, God!
[170:27.35]I'm the master of fucking dark... Yeah!
[170:35.14]Okay, now I have to fight... Easy parts over.
[170:43.59]Oh, my dragon.
[170:45.81]You did great.
[170:47.65]Now I will... Fight.
[170:58.18]You now face the true boss.
[171:04.48]He's here to fight you.
[171:08.49]That was me.
[171:09.11]I thought I was a statue.
[171:12.89]So many of those damn things.
[171:14.39]I'm the master of Dark Souls, buddy.
[171:17.83]You want to fight me?
[171:24.51]Ooh, that stung.
[171:29.54]His AI is broken.
[171:30.52]I'm gonna win.
[171:31.52]His AI is fucked up.
[171:34.44]He doesn't have any RNG.
[171:35.68]He hasn't rolled any dice.
[171:37.42]I'm gonna kill him.
[171:49.09]Alright.
[171:49.27]Alright, I'm gonna put on armor.
[171:56.86]Let's put on actual armor.
[172:02.38]Shit, I'm gonna run out of mana before I fight this guy.
[172:06.52]No, I need lightning.
[172:07.90]Good lightning.
[172:17.67]Good kill.
[172:20.67]Use a shield.
[172:22.87]Oh, no shields.
[172:26.02]No shield.
[172:26.36]No shield.
[172:33.30]Robe of Prayer.
[172:34.24]No.
[172:34.60]Anything better than that?
[172:41.57]I can't put that on.
[172:42.33]It weighs too much.
[172:53.57]Too many pieces in this game.
[172:58.45]There are too many pieces.
[173:00.13]One too many.
[173:02.53]Alright.
[173:02.79]Let's try it again.
[173:12.30]I feel like... I feel like I could probably do it.
[173:16.54]Maybe.
[173:16.86]I'm using Ember.
[173:22.20]No dragon shit.
[173:23.64]I'm gonna get it off the bar.
[173:26.49]So I'll cycle through it.
[173:28.13]Look at all these names.
[173:29.27]I'll give it one more try.
[173:30.39]And then we're just gonna combo them.
[173:41.62]I just don't need to freak out at this part.
[173:47.09]I feel like I can get a good cast in right here.
[173:59.50]Yes, I can.
[174:00.16]Damn, that did a lot of damage.
[174:02.20]Okay, just be easy.
[174:15.12]Still can't see.
[174:22.84]He was behind a fucking statue, couldn't even see.
[174:46.80]Come here, you!
[174:48.26]Come here!
[174:50.58]Dammit, I had a shield on!
[174:52.46]That's not gonna do anything.
[174:54.70]Oh my god.
[174:55.62]Alright, let's go.
[175:20.18]I got some shit.
[175:22.18]Let's do it, buddy.
[175:24.08]Fuck up your AI again.
[175:30.97]Wow!
[175:31.49]I thought he was going to do the thing where he shoots the beam.
[175:38.99]This is going to be fucking hard as sorcery.
[175:40.51]I can already tell he moves around so damn much.
[175:57.75]No, don't take it for granted, son!
[175:59.79]I'm gonna run out of mana.
[176:12.64]Come on, you.
[176:25.52]Right, drink now.
[176:29.77]Why are you doing that?
[176:30.41]You're wearing a shield in your other hand, bud.
[176:32.61]That's where we get killed.
[176:49.21]Come on.
[176:50.01]Bullshit.
[177:01.83]What?
[177:08.27]Oh, boy.
[177:08.67]I'm in trouble here.
[177:16.59]Ah, that's a new move.
[177:18.07]Oh, and it explodes, too.
[177:19.31]It explodes, too.
[177:21.77]Okay, that's new moves.
[177:27.61]Those are new moves that I didn't know.
[177:37.73]Alright, cool.
[177:44.30]I almost want... I'm missing so many fucking Estus shards.
[177:53.14]I feel like...
[177:56.93]That was a good try.
[177:58.77]That was a good try.
[178:01.94]I wonder if there's something else I could do.
[178:08.80]That's a solid second try.
[178:12.46]We're gonna give it a solid third try.
[178:18.50]And I'm actually going to... I'm gonna run out of mana.
[178:21.77]I'm not gonna be able to kill him.
[178:26.79]I foresee a situation where... Oh, by the way, thank you, Optimist.
[178:31.69]Thank you, Optimist, for your sub.
[178:35.01]I gotta wear armor for this fight.
[178:36.13]Puts on filthy rags to prepare.
[178:38.25]This'll do.
[178:38.69]I know, right?
[178:43.53]I need to take the shield off because if it comes down to it and I have to fight this guy, I'm gonna need to be able to hurt him.
[178:53.43]Because I can already see it in my head.
[178:55.81]I'll have him down to like 15% health.
[178:58.29]And I will be out of mana.
[179:01.85]You don't use your shield not once.
[179:05.32]Put shield in your left hand.
[179:06.40]No, we're just going for it.
[179:11.18]This is my last try here.
[179:12.44]And then we're going to co-op him.
[179:16.76]Actually, we'll see.
[179:28.97]Depends on how bad this one is.
[179:46.07]God-fucking-dammit sorcery, why do you suck?
[179:57.73]That was super gritty, but whatever.
[179:59.77]Okay.
[180:12.71]He's right in front of my face!
[180:15.91]Okay.
[180:21.20]Here we go.
[180:24.06]Let's try it.
[180:29.75]Really?
[180:43.36]Ah, mistimed that.
[180:44.78]Shit, that was a big mistake.
[180:50.58]Fuck.
[180:56.25]Oh, boy, I'm in trouble.
[181:11.11]Ah, shit.
[181:13.41]Come on, be stupid.
[181:41.52]Shit, I had half trouble timing that one.
[181:57.78]Oh fuck.
[182:05.69]Fuck you!
[182:08.43]Wow, I thought I dodged it.
[182:18.63]Oh dear.
[182:42.75]Eat my shit!
[182:52.59]I got him closer.
[182:54.11]I got him closer.
[182:55.87]I got him like 30% closer.
[183:04.01]Damn it.
[183:04.71]I'm so close.
[183:05.89]I'm so close.
[183:12.78]Use the great sword.
[183:17.08]Progress.
[183:17.54]That was progress.
[183:18.36]Alright, how about this?
[183:20.86]The first time I don't have real progress is when I'm just probably going to head to bed.
[183:25.22]Because it is getting really late here.
[183:26.62]It's getting like 2 o'clock in the morning.
[183:28.64]I'm getting tired.
[183:39.89]I think I can do it, though.
[183:41.83]I think I'm getting his patterns down a little.
[183:44.84]It's just this first fight.
[183:46.04]I can't take any unnecessary damage here.
[183:51.39]Let's give it a go.
[183:53.51]Use the great sword.
[183:54.31]No, I'm locked in on sorcery.
[184:10.16]Fuck.
[184:11.14]He hasn't done that move in a long time.
[184:13.27]Wasn't ready for it.
[184:28.14]Stand under his belly is not really a terrible idea.
[184:31.26]Yes it is!
[184:33.69]Yes it is a bad idea.
[184:36.27]It is not a good idea to be under there actually.
[184:43.49]Come here!
[184:54.90]Okay, let's give it a shot.
[184:59.34]Let's give it a go.
[185:07.90]Fuck, he was in the damn dust.
[185:09.90]I didn't see him.
[185:16.65]I'm in deep trouble.
[185:17.93]I don't have any mana either.
[185:20.53]I'm dead.
[185:22.29]Yeah, I'm just getting too tired and sloppy.
[185:28.66]I don't think I have to co-op this, though.
[185:31.22]I think I could do it eventually.
[185:34.29]I'm just tired and... Expelling all my energy.
[185:42.47]One more try.
[185:43.49]One more try.
[185:44.37]One more try.
[185:45.03]I can't go in there with...
[185:51.58]Like a drained mana bar, though.
[185:53.36]That's a stupid idea.
[185:54.32]Because then I have to switch.
[185:55.30]And that gets my mind off of dodging.
[185:58.90]Yeah, I won't co-op this guy.
[186:00.08]I could definitely beat him.
[186:02.86]This is definitely one of those doable things.
[186:04.92]Let's try it again.
[186:05.50]I'm going to be quiet this time.
[186:21.42]Thank you.
[186:21.84]Bullshit.
[186:22.40]That's dumb.
[186:28.73]If you're locked on, I don't care what fucking, who you are, what you say.
[186:36.13]If I'm locked onto somebody, I should be in range of a spell.
[186:39.04]That's fucking stupid.
[186:44.06]Now this whole thing is over.
[186:48.62]If you're in range to be locked on, you should hit the fucking spell.
[186:52.63]That's just... Come on.
[186:55.11]What is that?
[186:59.93]That one doesn't count.
[187:07.43]You want me to use the Moonlit Sword?
[187:08.95]Alright, I'll use the Moonlit Sword this time.
[187:10.87]It's gonna get me killed, but I'll do it.
[187:14.39]I can't cast any spells!
[187:17.03]These are my spells.
[187:18.35]Alright, we'll try these as my spells.
[187:24.19]Well, not yet.
[187:44.20]Nope, it's not going to happen.
[187:46.96]I'm already like annoyed, angry and tired.
[187:50.03]Just fucking slashing with the sword.
[187:51.53]Who gives a shit right now?
[188:07.95]Doesn't hit anybody?
[188:11.21]How did that not hit anyone?
[188:15.07]That does a lot of damage.
[188:16.75]It hurts, but it takes a long time.
[188:18.79]I'm exhausted, it's over.
[188:43.86]This thing's too unreliable right here.
[188:47.42]Doesn't go that far either.
[189:00.80]Doesn't take very much mana though, that's one good thing.
[189:11.22]What does the left trigger do?
[189:13.98]Oh, I can't see.
[189:18.64]I want to see what the special move is.
[189:24.20]Probably should have tested this not on one of the harder bosses in the game.
[189:27.81]That would be probably a good idea, right?
[189:36.52]So is it going to break?
[189:38.76]Well, I'm just fucking around with this sword right now.
[189:41.74]Just seeing what it does.
[189:44.37]Just reduces durability.
[189:45.63]Oh, man.
[189:47.13]That doesn't sound good.
[189:52.41]Come here, you.
[190:05.09]Come here.
[190:09.51]Die!
[190:34.99]Shit!
[190:35.79]It was going so well!
[190:37.77]It was all going so well!
[190:47.07]Alright, let's try and use the Moonlit Greatsword against him.
[190:53.64]Let's go.
[190:54.02]Let's see what I can do here.
[190:54.96]Let's see if I can hit him with it.
[191:03.89]Not bad.
[191:05.21]Takes a long time, though.
[191:18.78]No, I'm dead.
[191:21.90]Nah, it's a little too slow for me.
[191:26.56]Oh, I guess I could, uh... I wanna try it one more time.
[191:29.77]One more time.
[191:31.65]Yeah, I don't think I wanna be in his melee range.
[191:43.37]Back to bed.
[191:46.21]Well, considering, let's put it this way, right?
[191:49.17]One great soul arrow, I can be very far away from him.
[191:53.59]Does what, like 280?
[191:54.64]Like 300?
[191:55.04]Do you want an R1?
[192:07.44]Won't that do, like, nothing?
[192:10.04]I guess it does.
[192:13.09]I thought the, um... I thought it was that the magic was scaling off of the... Like, projectile shit.
[192:21.07]Not necessarily the... You know what I'm talking about.
[192:24.36]You know what I'm trying to say, but I can't speak because I'm... Yeah.
[192:26.44]I'm gonna die because I'm talking.
[192:29.08]Speaking words.
[192:29.88]It's gonna kill me.
[192:38.26]Where's he going?
[192:39.12]Woo!
[192:59.56]Hello.
[193:02.30]Ah.
[193:11.70]Oh, come on.
[193:13.06]What the fuck, dude?
[193:14.36]Like, give me a break.
[193:16.55]That's just dog shit.
[193:17.89]I was right next to him.
[193:21.33]Yeah, I'm too tired.
[193:22.35]It's time to go to bed.
[193:24.90]It's time to go to bed.
[193:27.14]I've been up since, like, 6 o'clock in the morning.
[193:34.14]No, one more time.
[193:36.08]Last one.
[193:44.51]No matter what happens here, I'm done.
[193:46.21]I just want to get to, like, the next phase with this in my hands.
[194:08.50]Lightning bolt.
[194:12.98]And then we crash it down... to the left.
[194:20.22]Oh my god.
[194:35.87]That's the type of shit that just boggles my fucking mind.
[194:40.41]How that doesn't hit him.
[194:42.37]It really does.
[194:43.11]It just boggles my fucking mind.
[194:47.82]He's like a quarter of an inch out of the hitbox.
[194:49.72]And I'm apparently attacking... Oh god.
[194:56.72]Put this fucking thing away.
[194:59.10]Okay.
[195:23.61]I know I'm going to lose, but I just want to get to this phase there.
[195:29.26]I'm going to try to fight him with this thing.
[195:37.92]Alright.
[195:39.21]Let me just fight him normally.
[195:42.19]I'm going to just swing at him.
[195:51.06]That doesn't do very much.
[195:56.78]Plus I have to be right in his face when I can just do like almost two times that.
[196:01.06]Wow he missed.
[196:01.74]What an idiot.
[196:02.16]He just did what I did then.
[196:04.04]Oh now I'm calling him names and he hears me.
[196:11.18]Oh boy.
[196:11.52]I'm in a bad spot.
[196:16.50]I can do 235 and I can be very, very safe.
[196:21.12]I think I like that.
[196:26.98]That's the one that keeps fucking me over.
[196:29.42]This is very... The timing of it is awkward.
[196:32.98]But, have a good rest of your night, guys.
[196:35.12]I'm going to bed.
[196:36.00]In a second.
[196:42.08]After I kill him with, like, two of my outfits.
[196:46.98]Well, very safe.
[196:48.16]More safe than doing like 20% less damage and being in his face.
[196:58.81]And I don't have the Titanite to upgrade it.
[197:00.85]The Titanite scale.
[197:02.07]I'd have to like go buy it.
[197:05.01]Probably better in the long run.
[197:06.17]But, you know.
[197:13.08]Rage?
[197:13.48]No.
[197:13.58]I'm just tired.
[197:14.60]I'm sleepy.
[197:16.10]I'm sleepy.
[197:22.00]I'm gonna take it out on this fucking idiot.
[197:23.48]Yeah, I'll be live tomorrow, the regular time.
[197:34.87]I'm gonna do something fun tomorrow night.
[197:41.31]What's wrong with one more try?
[197:44.39]Also, it really doesn't help that I have very, very low endurance.
[197:50.25]My endurance is like... Shouldn't I be at least 30 or 40 on Vigorant Endurance?
[197:55.44]This character just sucks.
[198:04.42]I sacrificed everything to put 50 points in Intelligence.
[198:08.79]So my character just is a bag of dog shit.
[198:13.45]But I think I can beat him.
[198:15.19]Just need to... Not do it when I'm this tired.
[198:24.16]Character sucks.
[198:27.64]If I came in here on my dex character, I would probably do much better.
[198:30.82]Well, I know I would do much better.
[198:31.98]20 to 30 for endurance.
[198:40.72]Yeah, but...
[198:45.45]I'm on the low end for endurance, for sure.
[198:48.75]I would like to have 30 of each, at least.
[198:53.52]And I need more Estuses, too.
[198:54.68]I have... I don't have very many.
[199:00.14]Alright.
[199:00.80]Good night, guys.
[199:02.04]Thanks for watching.
[199:03.32]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[199:04.06]Thanks for all the new subs and all that good shit.
[199:08.26]I'll see you dudes tomorrow night, 7 o'clock Eastern.
[199:10.97]We're gonna play something fun.
[199:12.77]I'm gonna get some rest.
[199:15.84]Have a good night.
