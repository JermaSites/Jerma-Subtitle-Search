[00:39.69]I sent you a link in Discord that might work.
[00:43.05]It says awaiting response in my manager thing.
[00:47.51]OK.
[00:49.81]Awaiting response.
[00:58.68]OK.

[01:54.67]Yeah, we don't need to do this.
[01:56.43]So do we just mute this?
[01:58.91]Oh, I see you in here.
[01:59.65]Yeah, you have to mute every turn off camera, turn off mic, turn off audio.
[02:04.33]OK, settings.
[02:06.50]Alright, but are we just like are we connected right now, though?
[02:09.42]It looks like it, yeah.

[02:26.40]Mine didn't start?
[02:27.06]Well, I'm ahead of you.
[02:32.62]Why are you ahead of me?
[02:33.84]I should be getting a countdown for ads right now!
[02:38.48]I don't know.
[02:46.32]This guy's ad crazy.
[02:53.67]Okay, does yours do this sometimes?
[02:54.81]Does your, when it says, oh yeah, we're going to start playing ads at the beginning of your stream and it takes like 14 minutes to start?
[03:01.03]Nope.
[03:04.96]What the fuck is going on Twitch with my channel?
[03:20.88]You look like Joe Dirt.
[03:23.40]I told you I'm keeping it like we're not even starting.
[03:25.92]This is starting soon.
[03:27.98]Oh man, how long is your hair getting?
[03:29.55]Like when when is it done?
[03:31.83]When is it done growing?
[03:32.81]Does it just stop?
[03:39.05]I told you I'm just going to keep this going until I'm 40.
[03:41.03]OK, is that the real plan?
[03:44.93]Yes, the plan is to have this go to 40 and then and then do something crazy with it.
[03:49.88]I have honestly tried to grow out my hair like five times and every time it gets to like I don't know my bangs get to like my eyebrows and I'm like I hate this I'm done I just want to do I want to get to a point where I get it in a huge ponytail and can just run it all the way down and like maybe like squish it around and like stick it up here yeah I just want to do that one time in my whole life and I okay finally that now it says my unicorn horn
[04:18.45]Yeah, I want to just have one.
[04:19.45]I'm gonna have a whole like a hair horn right here.
[04:24.31]And then, uh, then me and Holly gonna try thing where she grabs the top of it and just like I kind of go dead weight and she just spins around and tries to spin me around.
[04:35.17]Hi, you guys should duel.
[04:37.11]You should both get hair horns and duel.
[04:40.88]I apparently my ads are going to start in 30 seconds and yours.
[04:43.10]You're already going.
[04:44.26]Mines are mines are over in 30 seconds.
[04:48.47]What the fuck?
[04:49.25]Are you on three minutes?
[04:50.11]What are you on?
[04:52.97]I was on the exact same as you.
[04:55.07]Why does my channel do this?
[04:57.86]Watch it.
[04:58.24]It probably won't even start in 15 seconds.
[05:00.38]Ads are going to start in 10 seconds.
[05:01.68]If they don't, I'm going to be very cross with twitch.tv about this.
[05:04.82]I'm going to be incredibly cross about this.
[05:06.68]We can sync up later.
[05:07.36]We can sync it up.
[05:09.92]When yours... When mine are going to happen, I think you can press the button to do it manually and it works.
[05:17.36]if it's like close to the timer then it works alright they just mine just started so mine just ended so okay everybody come over here and then you can hear us talk and then go back there yeah just go you go to Ster I mean we're streaming together right you can drop the menu down you can see I'm gonna sink the watches we sink the watches it's just for some reason my channel takes like an extra 10 minutes to load up its ads
[05:44.88]And then, hey, this is going to happen in the middle of a boss fight.
[05:46.96]It's going to be fucking hilarious.
[05:49.00]Alright, so you want to tell your stream what we're doing today?
[05:56.73]No, I can't take today.
[05:57.81]We are playing Dark Souls three co-op with the randomizer.
[06:04.67]and I'm not in the game yet I need like one minute because now I'm trying to like make you louder again is are you really at max volume I am I am loud and I'm here let me just make sure let me hold on hold on hold on let me go into my Discord settings voice and video yeah my input volume is is load all the way out to 100 this is so like
[06:30.48]I put you at 200% and I don't think it makes you louder.
[06:33.86]Okay, let's try this.
[06:36.52]I'm going to turn off the automatic input sensitivity thing.
[06:39.97]You tell me how bad it sounds.
[06:41.93]Okay.
[06:42.21]Hi.
[06:42.75]Hi there.
[06:42.99]How are we doing?
[06:45.05]Same.
[06:45.29]Same?
[06:46.05]Same.
[06:46.63]Hey, hey, how are you?
[06:47.85]Hey, hey!
[06:48.83]No?
[06:50.09]Same.
[06:52.06]I don't know.
[06:52.78]I don't know.
[06:53.90]And you can't make it a little bit louder on your end through the mixer?
[06:58.77]I haven't maxed out.
[06:59.59]I'm looking if there's anything else I can do.
[07:03.32]I don't.
[07:03.60]I hate computers.
[07:05.20]No, apparently you're no.
[07:06.78]Apparently you're fine online.
[07:08.14]Never mind like it just sounds weird in my headset.
[07:10.20]I've been changing my ignore me.
[07:11.70]Ignore me.
[07:12.40]Mine does the same stuff.
[07:13.46]It does the same stuff, trust me.
[07:16.79]OK.
[07:20.77]Alright, my ads are ending in one minute folks.
[07:23.59]Hold on there.
[07:28.12]And then we're going to get this started and we can do our introductions.
[07:31.52]This is going to be a 10-part video series, by the way.
[07:36.05]We are not stopping until we beat the game four times.
[07:39.29]We're doing New Game Plus 4.
[07:46.75]Yeah, on my last stream... In between each one, we're going to do seven hours of PvP.
[07:51.60]Nah.
[07:53.18]Okay, six.
[07:56.87]Alright, I'm good to go in 20 seconds.
[07:57.99]Alright, so then when yours pops up, maybe just you snooze yours so then it will be like synced up in the same time.
[08:06.88]Yeah, I'll I'll figure it out dude.
[08:08.56]I'll just follow your lead.
[08:11.52]And hey, make sure to check out Ster channel Ster.
[08:14.14]It's twitch.tv/Ster.
[08:15.98]He's got a cool thing going on there.
[08:17.85]OK, Helen, here we go.
[08:20.27]Pretty cool, pretty cool stuff.
[08:23.41]Lots of lots of games.
[08:27.72]Playing lots of video games.
[08:31.48]Anybody read that?
[08:38.73]I am in the game.
[08:39.83]Okay, are we ready to play?
[08:43.61]Yes.
[08:46.51]Alright, it is time.
[08:48.67]We are going to go for it.
[08:52.87]Alright, did you see my character's face?
[08:55.24]Not yet.
[08:55.62]I have not.
[08:56.00]I haven't really looked.
[08:57.71]okay okay turn turn towards the uh go spin around put the shield down uh I was trying to do like if you were to draw Andrew tate from memory how close
[09:19.75]I think it's way off.
[09:23.87]I think that's pretty good.
[09:25.65]I am just default character because we wanted to test this and make sure it worked and we were too scared that if I went back and made a character it was not going to be good.
[09:37.54]Okay, so we did Randomizer, so our characters start with random items.
[09:42.14]We picked Depraved, so we get as few items as possible, and this character has nothing.
[09:48.09]We have the Dark Fist, which I didn't even remember was an item.
[09:52.27]I don't know if it deals damage.
[09:54.91]We were trying to remember how to dual-wield weapons,
[09:58.79]apparently you can't and we just get shield mode okay so one one of us needs to be the well and we could see Nameless King literally down the street here yeah can you see who it is I don't I have no idea but we should go backwards we should go backwards and get sick loot yeah oh yeah I just ran past all the enemies let's see who it is because maybe we can be gamers and beat him with the shields well no there's going to be drops back here
[10:25.48]I know, but you don't want to just get the reveal out of the way?
[10:27.32]There's like the crystal lizard.
[10:28.40]The reveal.
[10:28.98]No, you have to lead up to the reveal.
[10:30.50]Okay, fine.
[10:32.00]It also tracks how many times each one of us has died, which is funny.
[10:37.24]In my chat, tell me if my sound is bad or if I'm just a lunatic.
[10:42.95]I think we get easy tutorial enemies here.
[10:48.85]Why is this so loud?
[10:49.91]Every time I hit this, it's wicked loud.
[10:51.81]Hold on.
[10:56.49]This seemed pretty good.
[10:57.97]I'm hearing a dragon.
[10:59.89]A dragon?
[11:01.15]Yeah, where the crystal lizard is.
[11:03.87]Is it too loud?
[11:10.19]I do hear some- fuck, no.
[11:14.30]Alright, so we go- let's go find it.
[11:18.20]Okay.
[11:19.56]I'll leave the tank.
[11:20.72]Walking.
[11:22.94]This hurts still, by the way.
[11:24.84]Nice.
[11:25.20]Good job.
[11:25.70]Walking.
[11:30.04]We got this.
[11:31.78]We need to get something.
[11:33.12]Don't kill the bug.
[11:33.76]We have to take the bug outside to the garden.
[11:37.33]Don't kill the bug.
[11:39.59]Ignore the bug.
[11:44.61]What is going on over here?
[11:46.21]I don't... This might be harder than the boss.
[11:49.89]Whatever this is.
[11:55.50]What is it doing?
[11:55.94]Why is there so much fire?
[12:03.50]Dude, this is one of the... This is one of the... This is one of the main dragons of the whole game.
[12:10.63]No, we can't... Dude, we can't even go over here.
[12:13.25]This is Medeir.
[12:14.19]Oh, oh.
[12:15.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:16.35]Okay, okay.
[12:16.93]We come back later for Medeir.
[12:19.43]We're not going to come back later.
[12:20.49]This is like late game content.
[12:22.11]We'll come back in like five days.
[12:24.49]I'm going to forget he's there.
[12:25.41]They help scale down to what the enemy is, I think.
[12:30.91]Dude, it's so annoying that I have to use this.
[12:33.27]We're killing this, by the way.
[12:35.24]We should.
[12:36.10]No.
[12:38.32]No, you're being cruel.
[12:40.22]We need items.
[12:41.12]It did nothing wrong.
[12:43.58]You're doing the last hit on it.
[12:45.54]No.
[12:46.20]Yes, you are.
[12:46.64]No, don't make me.
[12:47.53]No.
[12:48.27]Do it.
[12:48.79]Do it.
[12:49.81]No, I'm so sorry.
[12:52.41]It poisoned me.
[12:55.79]It deserved it.
[12:59.53]Alright, well, Crystal Lizard, Crystal Lizard, get it!
[13:07.92]Okay, what do we get?
[13:12.28]Wow.
[13:14.40]What?
[13:15.14]This seed is going really well so far.
[13:17.02]How is there nothing?
[13:20.38]Sometimes you do some getting and sometimes you get got.
[13:25.26]Are you sure the seed is working?
[13:26.50]You're just dying of poison.
[13:28.54]Alright, finally, a regular enemy.
[13:31.52]I'm having a minor issue.
[13:39.45]You run around, you frolic.
[13:40.83]You good?
[13:42.07]Yeah, on my screen, it just permanently, because they're streamed together, says, like, Jerma, and there's a blank square.
[13:49.47]Uh, this guy didn't drop anything either.
[13:53.32]Alright, I turned the volume down a little.
[13:54.84]It was a little egregious.
[13:55.84]You're gonna die of poison, by the way, if you don't drink.
[13:58.42]I gotta drink!
[13:58.98]I'm dying.
[14:05.32]I'm dying.
[14:09.02]Okay, EA Sports, it's in the game.
[14:11.16]I guess we gotta, we go boss.
[14:13.24]We kinda have to.
[14:14.38]There's nothing we can do about this.
[14:17.23]Wait, maybe on this guy?
[14:24.74]Are you sure there are items in the game?
[14:26.32]Like, are they turned on?
[14:27.12]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:29.02]Yeah.
[14:32.53]Why wouldn't there be items?
[14:34.27]I don't know.
[14:34.63]Make sure you drink your mana because you've already used all of it.
[14:38.47]We're going to rest at the bonfire.
[14:40.17]Put your shield in your left hand.
[14:41.61]No, because then I can't go like this.
[14:45.06]Wait, can you?
[14:47.54]I was using it as a weapon.
[14:49.22]I think everything subtly changed in Elden Ring.
[14:54.83]And I don't remember how it works.
[14:56.13]Also, here's how the bossing works.
[14:58.51]If you don't recall, when you die in a boss fight, you'll respawn at the bonfire and you like permanently lose, I think, max HP and you might be able to come back.
[15:07.96]I don't fully remember, but that might be correct.
[15:11.30]Well, let's just go see who it is.
[15:12.34]Maybe we can do it pretty easily.
[15:13.04]Crystal lizard.
[15:16.14]Wait, there's like five crystal lizards here.
[15:18.82]Kill it.
[15:19.28]Kill it.
[15:23.23]Kill this.
[15:27.63]Dude, I'm convinced that there's no items in this game.
[15:32.25]I mean, it's the tutorial.
[15:34.05]Where are you?
[15:35.41]We don't know that.
[15:37.83]Where are you?
[15:40.03]I jumped down a different way.
[15:42.27]Oh, there you are.
[15:43.01]They're not real crystal lizards, I think.
[15:46.17]Oh, so that's the issue.
[15:47.29]These are like tutorial enemies.
[15:51.14]Alright, I got a Titanite skill.
[15:53.32]Did you get the same thing?
[15:54.56]No, I didn't.
[15:55.14]I didn't jump.
[15:57.58]Oh!
[16:05.04]Oh, you don't know how to do the jump, do you?
[16:10.71]It's just a Titanite skill.
[16:12.13]Okay, don't get too excited the first time you've ever felt tall.
[16:23.90]oh shit uh one of these guys are actually really hard that's a good tutorial it is a good tutorial okay so uh we have a big problem by the way this is a huge problem okay who's the first who is that this is wolnir
[16:53.06]Oh, we got this.
[16:53.92]How are we going to fight?
[16:59.57]Hey, we got this.
[17:02.51]How do you do that?
[17:04.23]Select.
[17:06.99]We got it.
[17:08.98]You should give him the finger.
[17:10.54]I did.
[17:10.96]Alright.
[17:11.18]So if it's Wulnir, then we have to.
[17:13.88]It's Indux.
[17:15.24]Index Wulnir.
[17:17.84]Get it.
[17:21.14]What if he starts charging?
[17:23.20]I don't know.
[17:25.96]Honestly, I don't remember so much about this game.
[17:28.26]Who is on the ground?
[17:29.76]Who is this person on the ground?
[17:33.88]We might not be able to kill this boss.
[17:37.72]We did a bunch of damage already.
[17:39.19]Yeah, but we have to hit his bracelets.
[17:40.67]You lack confidence.
[17:43.15]Watch out.
[17:45.77]I'll get the one on the right here.
[17:47.33]I'll get the one on the left.
[17:52.19]Punch it, punch it.
[17:55.26]Careful, careful.
[17:56.30]Uh, something's happening.
[17:57.62]He's taking his giant, um, his giant, like, fucking web sword.
[18:02.62]Watch out.
[18:03.12]Got it.
[18:03.92]Web sword?
[18:04.66]I'm fine.
[18:08.99]I can't believe he's the Elden Lord.
[18:14.01]We can't hit his wrist through them.
[18:15.91]Honestly, if you go, like, behind him, I doubt there's hitboxes back here.
[18:22.01]Oh, hold on.
[18:23.51]He's like stuck on the wall.
[18:25.17]Yeah, yeah.
[18:25.97]Just walk him back.
[18:27.83]No, but what if we don't?
[18:28.57]We could break the game and we might have to stop.
[18:30.91]That's what it's about.
[18:34.10]That's what it's all about.
[18:41.72]So we're going down.
[18:42.40]It's just his other wrist here.
[18:48.25]God damn it.
[18:48.73]Let me...
[18:50.96]He's in the ground.
[18:52.10]I got it.
[18:52.74]Hey, look at that.
[18:53.32]First try.
[18:54.00]See, it's easy.
[18:55.58]Nice.
[18:56.18]Good item.
[18:56.78]Good item, I guess.
[18:57.96]This is genuinely easier than the normal guy.
[19:01.62]Did you enjoy your green blossom?
[19:03.96]Yeah.
[19:04.97]See, there's items in the game.
[19:06.03]We got green blossom.
[19:10.77]Nice.
[19:11.57]Nice.
[19:12.77]Good kill.
[19:13.13]That was a good kill.
[19:17.25]Alright, so now let's get in here and...
[19:20.35]How do cutscenes work?
[19:21.13]Do we just kind of do it at the same time?
[19:22.55]Uh, I think one person has to wait for the fog gate.
[19:29.48]I don't know.
[19:35.66]You're stuck there.
[19:36.38]Not time for you to go in there yet.
[19:38.56]Okay, I'll wait.
[19:39.88]Oh.
[19:42.10]Soul arrow.
[19:43.70]We probably should... You gonna be a wizard?
[19:46.24]I don't even know what I... What the hell should we even do?
[19:50.10]I don't know.
[19:50.48]It depends what we find.
[19:51.34]Wait, does this thing count as a catalyst?
[19:56.46]No.
[19:57.20]No?
[19:57.60]No.
[19:58.16]No, it's just a fist.
[20:06.35]Actually, it runs pretty good.
[20:07.53]It's running.
[20:09.01]I don't know if yours is running okay.
[20:11.07]Yeah, really well.
[20:13.01]Really well.
[20:20.83]I said, how high up is your TV?
[20:22.51]Why?
[20:22.59]Because I'm like this?
[20:25.81]Yo, because they don't know you're lounging in a chair.
[20:27.59]My whole screen is like a projector on the wall.
[20:33.68]It's mounted up on the ceiling.
[20:38.92]It's like right there.
[20:39.80]I think you're going to get there.
[20:40.78]I think you're going to get to the point where you stream from bed and are just looking at the ceiling.
[20:45.98]Maybe one day.
[20:53.25]We did it.
[20:54.05]We made it.
[20:54.61]We actually made it.
[20:55.49]Game over.
[20:55.93]Okay.
[20:56.29]It's been a while since I played Dark Souls 3 and I will say my opinion of Dark Souls 3 changed to I think Dark Souls 2 is good.
[21:12.72]I remember I convinced you we had this conversation.
[21:14.94]I would always say Dark Souls 2 was the best.
[21:17.82]Yeah.
[21:18.71]Which was a long time ago before like Sekiro and Elden Ring and I think even before Bloodborne.
[21:24.21]I think so.
[21:26.12]and then you were always the Dark Souls 3 defender, and then you said you replayed them, and you were like, nah, actually, I think he might be right.
[21:32.84]Yeah, you were absolutely right.
[21:34.70]Okay, and how I knew this was, so Holly had never played these games before, and had been exposed to like Elden Ring and Bloodborne, right?
[21:43.66]But never any of the Dark Souls games.
[21:46.24]And, well, I'm just doing health, honestly, right?
[21:50.50]I'm just going health all the way up.
[21:51.62]Yeah, I just, I don't know what we're going to have yet, so I just did health.
[21:57.27]And what happened was we went through Dark Souls 3 together, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and it got to a point where every area in Dark Souls 3, it seemed like I would look over to her while she was playing and like I was watching her and I'd be like, oh, hey, this area kind of sucks.
[22:14.02]Just be aware this area sucks.
[22:15.56]It's like a shitty area.
[22:16.56]Nobody likes this area.
[22:18.16]It sucks.
[22:19.08]And she's like, you know, you've said that about the last like five areas in a row.
[22:24.48]And I'm like,
[22:27.22]Yeah, I mean, some Dark Souls 2 areas suck, but it's like... I don't know.
[22:34.54]They have some charm to them.
[22:36.32]The Shrine of Almamama or something.
[22:39.57]Shrine of Amaya.
[22:41.25]I hate it.
[22:42.35]But that's about it.
[22:43.69]Until you get to the DLCs and then everything sucks.
[22:46.23]Are you putting the sword in there?
[22:50.43]Wait, we don't have this item.
[22:53.59]Yeah, we can't.
[22:55.39]What do we do about this?
[22:56.78]I don't know, want to go fight the dragon?
[23:02.13]Uh, actually, how do we do this?
[23:05.59]We might have to.
[23:10.67]We don't have to go find it, right?
[23:12.49]Doesn't somebody just give it to you?
[23:15.26]I don't recall.
[23:19.88]Search the area nearby?
[23:21.12]You have to find it somewhere.
[23:24.86]It shouldn't, um...
[23:27.48]The progress of where it is should still be before it.
[23:32.11]So we might have to go kill that dragon or we might have to like fight the people on the stairs up there.
[23:36.33]I know there's like a strong guy on the stairs.
[23:37.83]Oh no, if it's on Medir, that's going to be actually a like softlock.
[23:43.75]No, again, they're health scales.
[23:46.05]Like it should, he shouldn't have a lot of health.
[23:47.79]We can just man up.
[23:51.23]Alright.
[23:51.80]Listen to me.
[23:53.02]Listen to my online courses.
[23:56.73]I need $500.
[23:57.17]That's too hard.
[23:59.07]And then once I get all of the payments, I steal your soul.
[24:01.71]Alright, let's go get, let's kill shit.
[24:11.96]Have you ever played this game before?
[24:13.46]Wait, when did you last play this?
[24:15.52]When was your, you said you played them all recently.
[24:18.16]A couple of years, like a year and a half, two years ago.
[24:21.92]When did this game come out?
[24:24.66]2016, believe it or not.
[24:25.54]It's been almost 10 years.
[24:26.96]Because recently I was playing Assassin's Creed 1 and I have to say when I opened this game, it felt jankier.
[24:35.14]Like this game does by default not run it like more than 60 FPS.
[24:38.38]There's no settings.
[24:42.31]Oh, oh, trousers.
[24:44.03]Who's going to wear them?
[24:44.67]We can't both wear them.
[24:45.47]We can't both show up wearing the same trousers.
[24:46.77]You can wear the same shit very early on.
[24:48.45]No, no.
[24:50.13]I want to look different.
[24:52.41]It's just white pants versus brown pants.
[24:54.85]It doesn't matter.
[24:57.91]Wait, do we pull it from here?
[25:00.59]No.
[25:02.51]No.
[25:03.87]We actually have to find this fucking thing.
[25:05.31]Okay.
[25:06.65]What did we not... Wait, there's stuff over there that we didn't kill.
[25:08.79]There's a lot of stuff outside Firelink.
[25:14.80]I think we already killed everything here.
[25:16.86]It might also be on the merchant.
[25:19.77]Dragon, dragon.
[25:20.77]We're not going to be able to fight the dragon.
[25:22.07]He doesn't fire breath.
[25:23.51]We're going to be.
[25:24.29]Come on.
[25:29.57]Come on, dude.
[25:32.40]I'm going to start screaming.
[25:34.58]I'm going to get you through this.
[25:36.00]By the way, you also attack that dog real quick and the poison bug thing you wanted me to not hit, but the dog you don't care about.
[25:44.90]I thought you were a bug lover.
[25:49.19]All animals are gifts from God.
[25:57.85]Just not people.
[26:03.25]All dogs go to heaven and humans, we have to sit in a cage and watch the dogs enjoy heaven.
[26:08.87]Oh, all dogs.
[26:09.91]No, no.
[26:10.25]Did you like my sequel idea for all dogs go to heaven?
[26:12.19]Uh, I don't know that I've heard it.
[26:14.65]Because all dogs go to heaven too, colon, some dogs go to hell.
[26:20.58]I don't like that.
[26:21.26]They're supposed to be in heaven.
[26:26.55]I like the role reversal.
[26:28.31]I like you go to heaven and all the dogs like own coffee shops and are living lives and you're in the kennel.
[26:33.73]Yeah, but that's Zootopia, isn't it?
[26:35.59]But without that part.
[26:37.49]Well, doesn't everybody wish they existed in Zootopia?
[26:42.37]Not really.
[26:44.11]You don't like the bunny girl?
[26:45.63]Everybody likes the bunny girl.
[26:46.71]Are you serious?
[26:51.64]Alright, kill this motherfucker, please.
[26:58.39]You think we're going to be able to kill Medir with glowing red?
[27:01.59]We're going to kill him with like four punches.
[27:03.35]I smashed my hand with a hammer hands.
[27:05.85]Like holding the nail.
[27:06.75]How my hand hurts.
[27:08.92]Yeah, we both have swollen hands from hammering and nails.
[27:11.52]This is what you think is going to happen?
[27:12.72]It's doing a lot of damage.
[27:13.60]Here, just wait between the next fire and then run.
[27:15.62]Alright, three, two, one.
[27:20.19]You did not wait.
[27:20.89]Go, go, go.
[27:21.63]I go right.
[27:25.46]He can't even move.
[27:26.70]Attack, attack, attack.
[27:31.44]He's like playing tower defense.
[27:32.82]He's a turret.
[27:33.44]He can't move.
[27:35.08]Where's his health box?
[27:36.60]It's way above him.
[27:38.52]How much health does he have?
[27:41.14]A lot.
[27:44.37]Watch out!
[27:49.10]in the air oh tickles tickles tickles let's do it again he's doing it again drink drink drink I'm just blocking okay we need to split up split up with this no place to go besides this penis wait item item over here might be this one
[28:18.20]You have to cut his tail.
[28:20.38]It's a luring skull.
[28:21.67]Oh, my God.
[28:22.39]Let me check his health.
[28:24.21]He's almost dead.
[28:24.61]He's almost dead.
[28:24.95]We got him.
[28:25.23]We got him.
[28:25.49]We got him.
[28:25.79]Get him.
[28:25.97]Get him.
[28:26.13]Get him.
[28:30.65]Nice.
[28:31.11]Nice.
[28:36.20]Oh, kind of cool.
[28:38.50]That's a lot of... That's a big level up.
[28:40.36]A lot of trolls.
[28:50.10]This one?
[28:51.46]No.
[28:51.68]This one?
[28:52.02]Uh.
[28:54.94]Uh, this one?
[28:56.40]There's a whole other area.
[28:59.58]Wait, doesn't a small crystal lizard spawn there before that boss?
[29:04.30]Probably.
[29:04.78]It might be in the shrine too, so I'm saying.
[29:08.80]Uh, yeah, there's a there's the one NPC on the top left of the stairs near the shrine.
[29:17.34]that we might have to kill or the merchant can sell it let's go check the merchant yes like don't rest keep your souls I was just walking off the edge that was scary you just died you just sunk like a rock I'm fine didn't we kill these oh we were just we rested
[29:49.62]Dude, I just tried to do a jumping R1, a jumping R2.
[29:52.48]I played too much Elden Ring.
[30:00.70]Fuck this guy.
[30:01.24]We already killed him.
[30:05.25]And he doesn't hit you and he kills me.
[30:07.31]I'm dead.
[30:12.52]Why didn't you move?
[30:13.39]Because I was thinking he was going to hit you and it was going to be a funny image.
[30:17.81]I rolled.
[30:18.23]Alright, so I died.
[30:19.53]So now what?
[30:20.49]I come back and... How do I have more souls than I had when I was alive?
[30:25.30]I don't know.
[30:29.08]No, no, no.
[30:29.48]Do I?
[30:29.72]14,000?
[30:29.74]Yeah, I just got like 40,000 souls.
[30:32.24]40?
[30:32.26]I have 50k souls right now.
[30:40.77]Alright, maybe I should die.
[30:41.91]Alright, jump off the cliff and see what happens.
[30:49.08]Well, I hope that the aliens pick up my soul as the comet moves across Earth.
[30:59.27]Hey, now we're even.
[30:59.99]Now it's one to one.
[31:02.03]You totally don't have that many souls, do you?
[31:04.31]No, I do.
[31:04.85]I have 50,000 right now.
[31:06.84]Okay, I have zero, so... Wait, did I just get all the fucking money?
[31:12.32]Why did I get like a check deposited in my account?
[31:14.68]I have no idea.
[31:17.54]I got it back.
[31:18.50]Oh, you just wanted to even the debts.
[31:21.52]I'm just telling you, I died and I got $50,000 for dying.
[31:24.63]Alright, you're on like... I put you on little cousin mode.
[31:29.27]I'm visiting for a holiday and I just like put a control in your hand that's not plugged in.
[31:43.28]You had a life insurance policy on you?
[31:45.01]Alright, yeah, there's a lot of stuff around this corner, yeah.
[31:53.64]Watch out for the poison.
[31:57.91]Oh, dude.
[31:59.43]How do you kick?
[32:01.49]It's up and R1 at the same exact time.
[32:05.73]It's the stupid bullshit thing that you're going to be doing that randomly in fights.
[32:08.88]You're going to be dodging and fighting.
[32:10.00]Yeah, I just did it by accident.
[32:11.94]It's the worst thing ever.
[32:13.76]I cannot believe this was not patched out of the game.
[32:16.68]Forward.
[32:23.65]Let's try the left side.
[32:28.16]Oh, wait, there's a... Yep, there's somebody here.
[32:31.65]This is where the Uchigatana is, right?
[32:33.75]I can't do it on purpose.
[32:35.41]I'm going to do it by accident.
[32:37.03]Yeah, no, we have to kill that guy.
[32:39.17]Bro, you stink.
[32:42.71]Alright, who is it?
[32:46.51]I think it's just a regular enemy.
[32:50.29]Who is it?
[32:53.37]Oh, shit.
[32:54.93]It's John Soles.
[33:01.25]Back step.
[33:03.35]Nice.
[33:03.65]Alright, I'll do the same thing.
[33:05.55]Charge punch, charge punch, charge punch.
[33:08.09]Oops.
[33:11.63]Okay.
[33:14.45]Estus ring.
[33:18.61]Now you are certain that we can actually get this item.
[33:24.16]Yeah.
[33:27.26]Here, come with me.
[33:28.30]I know where it might be.
[33:33.59]This dude smokes crack.
[33:35.53]Yeah, I know this guy's.
[33:36.58]Oh good, good item on that tree.
[33:38.40]Good item on that tree.
[33:40.70]This thing looks like you.
[33:53.10]What?
[33:55.67]Doesn't it?
[33:59.41]Your hair is the same length.
[34:01.41]It kind of does.
[34:03.89]I guess, yeah.
[34:12.40]I can see it.
[34:18.80]Nothing.
[34:21.83]It's somebody at the shop sells it for sure.
[34:24.69]Merchant is the most likely.
[34:28.03]But there's um.
[34:30.31]You know the there's like a item in the rafters you can get to.
[34:34.25]Yeah, there's like you can go all that work around.
[34:40.66]It wasn't there a staircase here or my crazy think it's up at the up with to go.
[34:43.74]It's up up all the way up in fire.
[34:45.82]We have to go inside and come out, yeah.
[34:50.32]It's 20k souls for the tower key.
[34:52.80]Oh, I could just buy that.
[34:53.64]You want to just go do the tower shit right now?
[35:00.39]Okay.
[35:07.69]Mr. I got a small loan of 50,000 souls.
[35:11.61]Oh, yeah.
[35:11.91]So what?
[35:12.28]My dad is Hades.
[35:13.72]I built this on my own.
[35:19.13]okay who we need to where where where's the lady do you sell it uh she sells it she has it yeah she has it thousand so should we just both buy it I think only one of us needs to I just bought it uh now the question is do we should we get some just default items here or is this illegal
[35:45.80]um the items that are appearing here I believe because of the randomizer you can only get them here so like if you want a short sword I don't think you'll ever see it ever again uh what I'm seeing in a lot in our in our shared chat room here um that this is illegal people saying that we shouldn't do this illegal wait what's illegal like we shouldn't be allowed to purchase these a coiled sword wasn't he no no like just any of the weapons weapons yeah
[36:12.87]okay uh but like I said if something something we need is in a merchant that is the only place where it will be yes and sorry I bought the two Titanite shards before I I can delete them I can urge myself oh you're fine uh by default but it's randomized oh that's the problem okay okay I can get great deep soul and divine pillars of light
[36:44.58]Well, apparently, no, you can't.
[36:45.73]That's cheating.
[36:46.95]That's from the ashes that we just got.
[36:48.43]The umbral ash.
[36:52.13]Wait, what?
[36:53.41]You didn't get ashes?
[36:54.73]Oh, I didn't give it.
[37:02.64]I should probably dump these.
[37:04.84]Should I save these souls?
[37:06.20]Should I buy just a bunch of fucking Endurance?
[37:10.86]I'm confused on the rules.
[37:12.38]I'm being hit with a lot of rules and then you got excited that you could buy things.
[37:16.41]Okay, so here's the thing.
[37:17.35]I don't know why I got an extra 35,000 souls.
[37:19.89]I don't know what happened.
[37:21.45]Are those illegal souls?
[37:22.37]Should I get rid of them?
[37:26.11]We're going to like bump into like a soul of a grand hero any second now from a drop and get like 100,000 souls.
[37:32.25]I wouldn't worry about it.
[37:33.31]Okay, so I'm going to level up endurance to like 40.
[37:40.00]Uh-oh.
[37:41.06]Oh, there we go.
[37:44.01]Alright, dude, I'm already level 28.
[37:46.71]She's touching my... She's empowering it.
[37:50.19]She's empowering it.
[37:51.09]She's empowering it.
[37:51.61]I'm already at, like, max endurance.
[37:54.66]Alright, we both can't do it at the same time.
[37:56.78]I'm just doing 30 points in endurance.
[37:58.38]I don't give a fuck.
[37:59.88]Farewell, Ashen One.
[38:01.42]May the flames go.
[38:03.75]What else should I do?
[38:05.97]Um... A Broadway musical.
[38:10.26]Oh, I think I just fucked myself.
[38:15.70]Because... Yeah, I think I just screwed up everything.
[38:19.33]Because I got to level 30 endurance.
[38:23.81]Oh, he's gone.
[38:25.77]He doesn't want to...
[38:28.72]oh and you did endurance not vigor I did endurance um I can't yeah I don't know what to do about this I'm kind of stuck here talking to her yeah uh I mean we can disconnect the co-op
[38:47.82]I think it's because I talked to her while you talked to her.
[38:50.67]And she like turned.
[38:52.23]You wanted to go.
[38:52.67]I can like sever the connection and you can come back.
[38:55.35]No, I can't.
[38:57.49]I could try it now.
[38:59.01]Try talking or not.
[38:59.57]Dialog maybe.
[39:06.73]Oh, what if you like just somebody said you can kick her?
[39:12.71]And what if you kick her?
[39:13.51]Will she?
[39:14.09]How do I do the kick up an R1?
[39:16.11]OK, there we go.
[39:16.95]We're good.
[39:20.52]what do you mean up on the d-pad no up like like this what do you mean up just press up like walk up like hit up yeah there you go oh oh like half the time I don't know I'm still getting the punch yeah who thought that was a good idea it's crazy okay don't talk to her don't talk to her she's mine I'm not going to you you gotta take as much time as you need
[39:48.87]I'm just going to do 30 endurance.
[39:51.23]I'll do it when I'm doing it to 30.
[39:52.58]Wait a minute.
[39:55.62]Why do I look at a Skate 3 creative character?
[40:10.03]Can I buy the short sword?
[40:14.11]It's a short sword.
[40:16.00]It's a short sword.
[40:18.98]You know what?
[40:19.42]No.
[40:19.86]Whatever.
[40:21.52]How do I get to the roof?
[40:24.50]Did you put the bonfire in?
[40:26.94]No, I didn't do it yet.
[40:28.68]Do it.
[40:31.06]I'm scared that... Should we do it at the same time or just... You're doing it apparently.
[40:37.32]I'm just helping you do it.
[40:39.14]Fist bump.
[40:43.08]Great work.
[40:44.78]Can you say short sword ten times fast?
[40:46.53]Short sword, short sword, short... Nope.
[40:51.04]Uh, 10 times faster than what?
[40:54.26]Got him.
[40:55.28]Alright, so going to the high wall of Lothric, right?
[40:59.33]Uh, burn undead bone shard?
[41:01.25]Oh.
[41:02.17]Travel to, yeah.
[41:03.31]Yeah, Lothric.
[41:04.07]Let's go.
[41:04.41]Let's do it.
[41:21.05]we made it together wow this area might be rough because there's usually like 30 dogs and they might all be not dogs yeah I just got 40 000 souls again for no reason we're gonna have to keep track of this because like I this actually would be cheating why why nothing happened
[41:43.91]Alright, you jump off a cliff and you see if you get another 40,000.
[41:46.79]Fine.
[41:47.15]Alright.
[41:48.23]Let's see what happens.
[41:48.87]But this does not count as a death counter.
[41:51.12]It will.
[41:53.62]I mean, we'll see the death counter.
[41:56.20]We're not going to do arithmetic later and be like, oh, well, it's actually minus one because, you know, we're not doing that.
[42:04.39]There's a lot of weird shit over here.
[42:06.23]Whoa.
[42:08.61]Isn't there bonfire right here?
[42:11.07]Yeah.
[42:19.84]okay we're good could you not crouch in this game I know you cannot and jumping is is it weird too you know what this game I uh I believed Miyazaki's lies and it was the last time I ever believed him because in a lot of the gameplay previews they showcased how the short bow
[42:43.43]would actually have like weapon abilities and you could like use bows and they had all these cool functions and he's like oh you could be like legolas and shoot it yeah okay dude yeah bow builds yeah okay careful uh what is what uh uh what what what's wrong I thought it was a dragon honestly this area might be easier without all the dogs
[43:15.42]That guy's not even playing the game.
[43:29.76]Wait, these guys are here normally.
[43:36.79]What is that?
[43:37.47]I've never... What?
[43:39.65]I saw a ghost.
[43:42.33]A ghost?
[43:42.59]I feel like I'm playing Lethal Company.
[43:46.07]you didn't see the ghost?
[43:46.83]watch out watch out no I didn't see I didn't see anything you're talking about okay well watch out ghost down there and repo souls how about these guys don't even aggro that guy just turned into a slug when did they do that why did he do that oh weapon hold on
[44:18.54]Yeah, let's go.
[44:20.66]Well, that's a lot of strength.
[44:30.53]You're looking kind of cute.
[44:33.23]We look pretty.
[44:34.05]We look pretty good.
[44:34.71]Actually, we look pretty great.
[44:37.01]You didn't go all the way up.
[44:38.55]Oh, you cannot and you.
[44:40.90]That's only on the other side.
[44:43.50]Uh.
[44:45.42]Uh.
[44:49.38]Alright, we can go.
[44:51.88]There's a ghost down there.
[44:53.47]There's a ghost down here.
[44:55.45]Yeah, I think there's a ghost down here.
[45:00.73]A golden scroll.
[45:05.85]Poison gem sick.
[45:16.90]I forgot how this area works.
[45:23.24]Uh, this area has two distinct... We go, like, down?
[45:27.86]I think it's... Wait.
[45:29.32]How do you... What do you go here?
[45:30.58]There's a way... There's, like, a door we can go in.
[45:31.80]And we go down.
[45:34.06]I like to go down.
[45:35.36]We... There's two different, like, places.
[45:37.27]You can go left or right from the bonfire.
[45:39.03]Yeah.
[45:39.29]You go left.
[45:40.03]Oh, there's a dragon.
[45:42.27]Oh, no.
[45:42.47]That's a dead dragon.
[45:43.71]Oh, good.
[45:44.17]Thank God.
[45:46.07]Whoops.
[45:46.41]I keep pressing X to crouch and waste flasks.
[45:55.46]Oh, okay, this guy's actually pretty scary.
[46:02.48]I love that this guy, these guys just like stack you.
[46:06.59]Why did I aggro this guy for?
[46:09.45]I don't, I don't know.
[46:10.37]It's like a fucking costume contest.
[46:16.51]Oh my god, I can't believe I survived.
[46:20.35]Look at the bug.
[46:28.61]I never, uh, I never beat the Ring City DLC.
[46:32.03]No?
[46:33.31]No.
[46:33.93]It was, it was, it was good.
[46:40.26]I think I did like the first boss and stopped.
[46:42.74]I don't remember why.
[46:43.54]So just so you know, you're playing with a new player.
[46:50.86]Ring City was, uh, you can find him here.
[46:52.67]You got him?
[46:59.64]gargoyle flame hammer anybody want a gargoyle flame hammer where'd you get that uh over by that guy we just defeated any gargoyles I'd like to take a look at it
[47:24.74]I can't really use it yet, but maybe I'll put some points into strength.
[47:27.79]Alright.
[47:28.09]What do you want to do?
[47:28.65]Do you want to do casting?
[47:29.87]Do you want to do strength?
[47:30.81]What do you want?
[47:31.29]What are you looking for?
[47:35.40]Alright.
[47:35.76]It depends what I find.
[47:36.68]I might just be a big bonk boy.
[47:39.28]So you want to do big two handers?
[47:42.67]Yeah, maybe.
[47:43.63]Okay.
[47:47.83]I always wanted to use, there's like a gladiator shield in the DLC.
[47:51.81]And then, like I said, I never played it enough to get it.
[47:54.92]Guys, if we can go down.
[47:58.94]Yeah, we gotta go down.
[48:05.38]They get the same loot?
[48:06.74]Yeah, if we didn't get the same loot, the seed would fuck up both of our games because it would be like, hey, why is that boss spawning?
[48:13.21]Why is that item in your hand?
[48:14.31]We're not in your game.
[48:15.03]It's not in your hand.
[48:16.42]I think we could make the loot separate because it is separate in the randomizer, but I did not do that.
[48:21.62]That's fine.
[48:22.54]Alright, scripted dragon usually flies over here, but I don't know what it is now.
[48:30.08]Is it still a dragon?
[48:32.64]It probably doesn't exist.
[48:43.44]Oh, oh, oh.
[48:44.50]The dragon is here.
[48:45.48]Oh, I'm leaving.
[48:46.66]I'm leaving.
[48:50.44]Okay.
[48:51.86]Let's go across.
[48:52.82]Oh, dude, I just got 700,000 souls.
[48:53.92]Did you?
[48:54.32]No.
[48:54.54]Alright, you ready?
[48:59.84]And go.
[49:03.00]I wasn't ready.
[49:03.55]I wasn't ready.
[49:05.03]I just went anyways.
[49:06.43]I'm sorry.
[49:09.65]I can't get by him.
[49:10.83]Help me.
[49:12.43]I can't.
[49:12.95]I can't.
[49:13.25]You're good.
[49:13.67]You're good.
[49:13.95]We made it.
[49:14.43]Watch out.
[49:20.87]Watch out.
[49:21.58]Watch out.
[49:22.24]I'm not starting this fight.
[49:24.22]Eleonora.
[49:25.30]Don't.
[49:29.44]Don't.
[49:29.80]Leave him alone.
[49:30.92]Why?
[49:31.18]He scared the shit out of me, dude.
[49:32.60]I'm sorry.
[49:33.11]I thought he was just a set piece.
[49:46.04]OK, that's a big two hander.
[49:48.76]Yeah, I'll use that when we can put points in.
[49:51.08]I think it's probably a bad idea to aggro this, so I don't think we should.
[50:06.73]Soapstone
[50:18.87]Nice.
[50:19.63]Whoa.
[50:21.31]Whoa.
[50:23.39]Let's go down.
[50:34.01]Pretty epic.
[50:37.42]Hold on.
[50:37.82]Hold on.
[50:38.48]Okay.
[50:39.00]These things explode?
[50:43.26]What things?
[50:46.20]Watch out.
[50:46.78]It's a charma.
[50:50.29]one hit just like the real one look at his bones it goes skinny this guy has never seen the sun I actually love the sun it's like my favorite object in the cosmos I'm sorry I just um oh yeah we can wait is this a different character in here yeah yeah you gotta this is like thief guy that usually sells like throwing knives oh okay
[51:27.33]Alright, now we go... Oh, you didn't even get... Did you get the item?
[51:31.25]You didn't.
[51:31.69]What are you... What?
[51:34.19]I'm just communicating to make sure we both are on the same page.
[51:37.24]About item collection.
[51:38.30]Because what if something cool happens?
[51:41.54]This one's locked.
[51:42.60]I mean, you didn't get the cool armor I'm wearing.
[51:45.54]I want to be a little different.
[51:46.48]So I'm winning.
[51:47.66]You were just complaining about how we have the same gear on.
[51:59.45]Watch out ghouls.
[52:02.60]Actually, watch out.
[52:03.22]There is a ghoul.
[52:08.52]That hurt a lot.
[52:21.41]Those guys can parry by the way, so they can be scary.
[52:27.42]You have to faint.
[52:29.37]Mix up your attack timings.
[52:36.05]Ooh.
[52:39.49]I think I turned into a guy with a candle.
[52:41.41]I think they're turning into randomized enemies.
[52:45.05]Because I saw one of those guys turn into a snail earlier.
[52:48.41]Okay.
[52:53.15]I got something new.
[52:53.87]Hold on.
[53:07.39]I gotta make a comment?
[53:09.43]On what?
[53:10.71]My new cool item.
[53:11.79]Oh, your hair?
[53:13.79]Yes, your hair looks amazing, honey.
[53:17.71]What's the routine?
[53:19.35]What products are you using?
[53:21.29]Whenever you go to the... When you ever go for like a drive, do you use a little product for the road?
[53:25.13]Can you hit that?
[53:29.64]Oh, too bad.
[53:39.16]It's just a shard.
[53:41.00]It sucks.
[53:43.20]Oh, what?
[53:43.50]That's an enemy.
[53:53.97]Randomizer is so funny because it really is just like kind of a... It reminds me of somebody's like first game project where they just kind of think an enemy looks cool.
[54:03.18]Like Unity assets?
[54:04.76]Yeah, just like, oh man, look at all these cool things.
[54:07.00]It's like a Warcraft custom map.
[54:12.14]Is this guy alive?
[54:19.00]You know, we missed that room up there, but usually I think it has a key item.
[54:23.38]Oh, OK.
[54:25.40]I think.
[54:32.04]Did we?
[54:34.04]Am I losing it?
[54:34.57]Yes.
[54:45.13]No, I keep trying to crouch!
[54:52.68]A lot of Titanite shards.
[54:58.16]I got two poison gems.
[55:01.46]Ember.
[55:03.04]Ember?
[55:03.30]Oh, you're getting cased.
[55:04.41]Pretty strong.
[55:04.77]In the early of the game.
[55:06.43]What the fuck was that?
[55:07.35]Dog.
[55:08.37]I thought you just howled.
[55:09.83]I thought that was you doing that with like the voice changer thing.
[55:16.06]Not this time.
[55:17.94]Where is this dog?
[55:18.67]On any other day.
[55:22.69]Oh, he's right here.
[55:24.13]He's like, I'm going to get you when you walk to destroy.
[55:25.77]Spears of the church.
[55:42.55]What is that?
[55:44.13]An item?
[55:45.11]Uh, accessory?
[55:46.19]I don't know.
[55:49.15]HP with flask.
[55:50.19]Oh no, that was a ring we got earlier.
[55:52.00]I don't know.
[55:52.68]What the hell is that?
[55:55.90]Covenant?
[55:58.12]Uh, okay.
[56:03.87]Jerma, if I was an animal, what animal would it be?
[56:09.70]I had this recent discussion.
[56:11.06]I'm curious if you have the same thoughts.
[56:15.34]And it can't be otter.
[56:18.22]No, no, no way.
[56:21.40]You're not sweet enough for an otter.
[56:26.00]Honestly?
[56:27.36]Honestly?
[56:27.82]Like a condor.
[56:32.55]A condor.
[56:33.71]Like an eagle.
[56:35.03]I don't know.
[56:36.21]I just see you guys like a condor, like looking down at stuff.
[56:41.51]Like a vicious predator who attacks other birds.
[56:44.95]I don't know.
[56:46.13]I don't know.
[56:46.51]It's the first thing I thought.
[56:48.44]Okay.
[56:50.14]I was being told I was a cat.
[56:58.36]Maybe.
[56:58.74]I feel like everyone's a cat.
[57:02.20]Yeah, everybody is a cat.
[57:03.04]We all have a little bit of a cat.
[57:07.80]We gotta go a little deeper than house cat.
[57:11.40]Yeah, I said you were a mountain goat.
[57:19.00]Kinda sick, actually.
[57:21.54]Yeah, mountain goats are crazy.
[57:25.15]You get this?
[57:25.63]You get this item?
[57:26.19]There's a sick item over here.
[57:27.21]You got this?
[57:27.89]I got it.
[57:28.25]I got it.
[57:28.53]It was Titanite Shard.
[57:29.39]No, over here where I am.
[57:33.47]What was it?
[57:34.03]I picked it up.
[57:36.49]Oh, the dung pies.
[57:38.89]Oh.
[57:42.98]Yeah, you need that to open a door in Anor Londo.
[57:45.96]You do the sniff test.
[57:48.68]Watch out.
[57:49.06]I actually have no heals left, so.
[57:53.12]Yeah, me neither.
[57:57.93]Is that the same enemy?
[58:00.73]Dried finger.
[58:01.81]He's kind of... You okay?
[58:05.63]I'm good.
[58:06.63]This guy's kind of sliding around out here.
[58:08.65]I'm scared of him.
[58:11.83]Why is there so much dust?
[58:13.91]Don't worry, I got it.
[58:17.95]Gamer moment.
[58:19.35]Oh, gamer moment.
[58:36.28]You got a weird blurry camera.
[58:38.14]Hey.
[58:40.90]I don't give a fuck.
[58:42.04]We don't give a fuck.
[58:43.26]We don't give a fuck.
[58:44.42]We don't give a fuck.
[58:46.06]Alright, we're getting close.
[58:51.70]That word offends me.
[58:59.14]You look cool.
[59:00.26]That's such a Ster hat.
[59:04.24]Ah!
[59:06.17]Is this our fourth dragon?
[59:09.14]Why is there a dragon in everything?
[59:11.10]Alright, who is shooting through the wall?
[59:24.20]You get the shortcut here.
[59:25.66]We gotta open up.
[59:26.60]Yep.
[59:26.72]Make sure you get the item.
[59:29.35]What is that thing?
[59:36.38]That guy's just drinking over there.
[59:37.44]That guy's not even fighting.
[59:41.10]Oh, okay.
[59:41.96]Actually, lock in here.
[59:42.94]Lock in.
[59:45.10]I'm dead.
[59:47.04]You're dead?
[59:47.48]Yes.
[59:55.48]It's okay.
[59:56.32]I'll come back with fucking 20,000.
[59:58.44]Where am I?
[59:59.24]Oh.
[60:00.86]I'm bringing the elevator up.
[60:02.84]Oh, hell yeah.
[60:03.44]Yeah.
[60:07.82]Elevator's this way.
[60:16.16]Looks like someone's got a couple of deaths here.
[60:19.98]I should bonfire right now.
[60:23.87]Thank you.
[60:28.17]Who cares about the souls?
[60:29.07]I just got them back for no reason.
[60:32.79]I think me resting, they might appear around here.
[60:35.15]Oh my god, they actually are all back.
[60:43.29]Are our watches synchronized here?
[60:44.41]How are you doing on an ad break?
[60:48.61]30 seconds.
[60:49.73]Okay, because mine are in five minutes.
[60:52.34]Okay, I'm going to get the snooze on you.
[61:04.23]wait what you did you just click snooze no alright okay mine are in five minutes alright let's get down here let's get it done it's just like auto snooze them I don't know weird a weird website
[61:28.62]Are you not able to like level up in this game at the bonfire?
[61:31.66]You have to go back to Firelink.
[61:34.23]I think that's accurate.
[61:37.29]Do you want to go back and level up?
[61:40.43]We have like a ton of Titanite shards.
[61:43.22]I could put in points to use the swords we got.
[61:46.59]I feel like we're insanely strong right now already without leveled up weapons.
[61:50.87]We are very strong right now.
[61:52.11]I think with the scaling, we have items that we shouldn't have, and it's letting us kill things in two hits, which is fine for now.
[61:59.02]But if you want to make this, you know, if you want to go kill bosses in like 10 seconds, we can do that.
[62:06.52]It's up to you.
[62:07.56]I'm just having fun.
[62:08.30]I'm going back.
[62:08.91]Alright, I'll go back.
[62:11.17]Wait, it didn't... I think we aggroed something.
[62:15.70]I just want enough strength to equip the item I found.
[62:20.04]Makes sense.
[62:20.86]Let's go.
[62:22.32]And then we'll do the break too.
[62:24.34]Yeah.
[62:25.22]Get that out of the way.
[62:29.50]I always thought I was like a chimpanzee.
[62:33.24]Wait, what happened?
[62:38.95]I don't know.
[62:39.55]I think we both did it and that's messing it up.
[62:42.63]Just you do it.
[62:43.97]You go first.
[62:45.03]Or the skeleton revived and is coming back.
[62:51.75]Hold on, we're getting invaded.
[62:52.70]Alright, you go first.
[63:00.32]We already went over this?
[63:01.12]Alright, are you leaving?
[63:03.28]Okay.
[63:05.68]You have revived back here.
[63:09.32]Okay, there's a skeleton.
[63:13.46]When you rest, the skeleton spawns and then you can't leave.
[63:16.36]You can't leave.
[63:17.14]Yeah, I think we might be in trouble.
[63:19.48]We have to go to the other bonfire.
[63:21.34]Yeah.
[63:22.72]Okay.
[63:23.10]Well, he drops a large Titanite every time.
[63:30.55]Dude, I can use the pick.
[63:33.29]Where is the other bonfire?
[63:35.08]We were close.
[63:36.54]We can just go fight the boss.
[63:38.06]I feel confident in our strength.
[63:42.32]I got a break coming up in minute 30.
[63:44.12]One's yours.
[63:49.75]I can do it when you do yours.
[63:54.15]I think you can reset it.
[64:05.78]You don't notice the hat?
[64:07.52]The mushroom hat?
[64:08.24]You just, you appeared behind me and I freaked out.
[64:10.71]I'm a huge portobello.
[64:13.33]Portobello?
[64:13.99]Let's get to a safe position and then we'll take our three, four minute break.
[64:19.59]And we'll get back into it.
[64:21.49]And we're gonna beat this.
[64:22.27]We might be able to beat this game like today, by the way.
[64:27.33]There's so much shit.
[64:33.30]There's so much shit.
[64:44.15]You got it.
[64:44.61]Nice job.
[64:44.91]You're doing good.
[64:48.58]I have 100,000 souls.
[64:51.82]Why?
[64:53.38]I don't know what it's doing, but I will be... Alright.
[64:57.44]This is safe.
[64:58.40]I have 20,000.
[65:01.00]Let's take a break.
[65:03.28]Okay.
[65:04.48]Be back in a few minutes.
[65:06.90]This is going to be really fun, though.
[65:08.40]I'm really excited about this.
[65:09.40]Be right back.
[65:11.90]See you in a few minutes.
[65:37.12]I'm confused Twitch is weird

[68:41.07]How are you?
[68:42.57]You good?
[68:43.18]Uh, I'm good.
[68:44.08]Yeah, no, I think we're synced now.
[68:45.96]Oh, perfect.
[68:46.70]What's your timer?
[68:47.34]Uh, rerolls are off for 59 minutes.
[68:51.74]59, 27, 59, 26.
[68:52.02]Okay, we are not, but whatever.
[68:54.54]Oh, fuck.
[68:56.71]Uh, you know what's interesting about you?
[68:59.51]uh is a moment ago you were saying that oh like I don't know if we should go fight that dragon I don't know if we should go fight that and just now before that break you were saying uh I think we're gonna beat the game today which is it I didn't know how strong we were we we have good items right now I'm using dude I put on the war pick this thing sucks absolute dick it's bad and it's and it's it's gonna cause us some problems if I don't put that fist thing back on
[69:27.21]Did I just say dick?
[69:27.71]Okay.
[69:28.43]Sorry about that.
[69:29.31]I meant to say... You said a lot of words that I am unfamiliar with, and I'm going to ask my parents what they mean later.
[69:35.39]But for now, we need to get down to the boss.
[69:37.94]Hold on.
[69:44.88]Putting money in the swear jar?
[69:46.56]Me!
[69:46.88]Okay.
[69:47.68]I'm ready.
[69:54.80]You've only died one time.
[69:57.85]Yeah, from the time you told me to jump off a cliff and I listened.
[70:02.21]Fight this thing.
[70:02.85]You're going to leave me to die.
[70:06.97]I can't hear.
[70:07.61]What did you say?
[70:08.31]What did you say?
[70:09.64]A strong breeze went by.
[70:10.88]What the fuck is going on?
[70:19.84]What is what enemy is that?
[70:22.42]Who has a gigantic laser?
[70:28.44]It's the dune sandworm.
[70:32.58]Lock in, lock in, lock in, lock in.
[70:37.72]I didn't think I would want.
[70:43.22]Yeah, I don't know.
[70:49.03]Lock in.
[70:50.89]Do you want to loot this area or do you want to just run down to the boss?
[70:58.37]Say that again.
[70:59.01]Sorry.
[70:59.29]I couldn't hear you.
[71:00.03]You want to loot this area?
[71:01.22]You want to go down to the boss?
[71:02.96]I think we should probably loot the area first, and then once the area is looted, we leave.
[71:07.14]Alright, let's stick together.
[71:08.38]Stay together.
[71:09.14]Nice ring.
[71:22.37]Whoa, I thought that was a chest.
[71:24.71]I'm sorry.
[71:25.19]I should have let you die.
[71:28.29]I'm thinking now that I was protecting you and I know that that's wrong.
[71:32.29]Why would there be a chest here?
[71:35.36]Yeah, in the middle.
[71:38.48]Whoops.
[71:41.62]I'm sorry, my senses are just being overloaded at the moment.
[71:44.18]Yeah, it's very loud.
[71:45.52]It's very loud for everybody.
[71:52.13]Ow!
[71:53.07]Okay, careful.
[71:54.23]Wait, these guys don't... Fuck you!
[72:00.10]Okay, these guys are tough.
[72:02.90]It's alright.
[72:08.74]Oh, co-op him!
[72:09.42]Co-op him!
[72:15.14]Poison!
[72:15.52]Poison!
[72:33.68]We got this!
[72:38.07]Can you see who the boss is in there?
[72:39.43]No.
[72:40.29]I don't.
[72:40.73]Hold on, hold on.
[72:41.35]There's some items here, I think.
[72:45.83]And something is also making like poop noises.
[72:49.90]Like someone had too much to eat up there.
[72:54.17]And were they just shitting on us?
[72:57.39]I don't know.
[72:58.51]They're having a bad time.
[73:01.65]It randomized the contents of his stomach and it did not agree with him.
[73:06.81]It filled it with a Nameless King.
[73:09.49]Yeah, we got a bunch of Cheerios this morning.
[73:11.17]They all turned into like new foods.
[73:16.77]Alright, are we going in here and just gonna get fucking killed or whatever?
[73:19.15]Alright, let's do it.
[73:19.85]No, we're beating it.
[73:24.75]You are fearing the Nameless King.
[73:27.14]Should we just watch the cutscene?
[73:28.36]Will it be a different enemy?
[73:31.16]I'm curious.
[73:31.60]I don't know.
[73:32.22]I don't think so.
[73:33.94]But maybe.
[73:34.30]Or watch.
[73:35.16]I got it too.
[73:35.68]Let's see.
[73:39.70]You can still hear that worm.
[73:42.12]It might even shoot the laser through the wall.
[73:51.92]What is that?
[73:55.94]Oh, it's still... it's warped.
[73:58.30]But what does it turn into?
[73:59.11]Did you skip?
[74:00.59]We skipping?
[74:01.61]Alright, ready?
[74:02.15]Skip.
[74:06.49]Crystal Sage of the Boreal Valley.
[74:07.87]It's already dead!
[74:09.69]It's... what do you mean it's already dead?
[74:11.97]But why is it hurt already?
[74:14.73]It's not for me.
[74:21.55]He can't move.
[74:27.07]I think we're beating this game today, by the way.
[74:29.25]I think we're gonna beat it today.
[74:30.65]They're gonna scale eventually, and we're gonna get a hard one later.
[74:42.42]Honestly, it should be concerning that we're getting an easy boss this early.
[74:46.62]That's true.
[74:56.34]Oh shit, actually kind of hurts.
[75:10.89]Destroyer!
[75:11.25]Can you imagine this with a base, like a ton of base on a subwoofer?
[75:18.71]Oh, base?
[75:19.33]Oh, this is it.
[75:20.11]Can you imagine this with a base?
[75:23.27]This could be a Vampire Survivors kind of song, you know what I mean?
[75:37.38]Alright, careful.
[75:41.74]How much do you think these crystals are worth?
[75:45.67]Somebody said the Warpick sucks ass.
[75:47.93]It's alright, I'm fine.
[75:53.91]Alright, so for on my screen, one hit kills it.
[76:00.12]Same for you?
[76:00.54]Yeah, yeah.
[76:08.94]Kill it.
[76:09.86]Please kill it.
[76:10.46]I'm dead.
[76:11.78]Kill it.
[76:12.06]Why do I have like a wasted GTA screen?
[76:16.00]I'm so far away.
[76:17.85]Hold on.
[76:43.75]I had the mission accomplished GTA screen.
[76:46.43]I don't know what happened to you.
[76:54.26]I'm coming.
[76:55.34]I think he dropped your favorite hat.
[76:57.72]Yeah, I did get it, so that's good.
[77:04.30]This thing is so annoying.
[77:05.18]It's just in the way.
[77:20.99]I can hear you coming because the worm is freaking out.
[77:25.77]Yeah, the worm scared the shit out of me.
[77:31.50]Alright, coming.
[77:31.84]Gotta make sure I pick up my 80,000 souls.
[77:34.28]I'm not gonna pick them up.
[77:35.52]I feel like it's cheating.
[77:37.52]Okay, I agree because you already spent so many points that we're desynced.
[77:41.99]I have 30,000 and I did not get the initial handout.
[77:46.79]Yep.
[77:50.09]We cannot hear?
[77:50.83]Turn it down?
[77:51.91]We need the banner, don't we?
[77:57.03]Turn it down even more?
[77:57.81]Better?
[78:06.16]Yeah, we need the banner.
[78:10.91]Oh, you get it from the lady over here.
[78:13.83]It's the most of the music.
[78:16.66]I mean, she might not give it to us.
[78:19.20]Oh shit, that's right.
[78:20.24]I can raise banner already.
[78:22.22]Yeah, you cannot.
[78:23.50]You cannot.
[78:24.88]Oh, you cannot.
[78:27.04]You cannot.
[78:29.56]What?
[78:31.58]Why do you lie?
[78:36.42]Can we go back real quick?
[78:37.94]Yes.
[78:39.64]Or we shouldn't because it'll respawn everything.
[78:43.00]Um, it's.
[78:45.36]We actually probably should find the banner wherever it is.
[78:51.48]Let's go.
[78:55.13]Turn this back up.
[78:57.79]That other merchant might sell it as well.
[78:59.47]That's another good bet.
[79:00.39]I think that's the most likely, but I don't know what key we need to save his soul.
[79:10.09]will the lady even be in here uh the NPC should we need to kill this thing it's coming it's coming or is it it's up the stairs let's get it let's destroy this thing
[79:43.74]Is it dead?
[79:44.16]Oh, my God.
[79:52.12]Alright.
[79:52.44]I can hear you.
[79:53.26]Okay.
[79:57.06]Thank goodness.
[80:02.85]Great.
[80:04.05]Great.
[80:04.39]Why is this here?
[80:08.85]What do you mean this?
[80:10.09]Oh, dude, you.
[80:10.91]Okay.
[80:12.21]We're going in.
[80:12.77]I'm
[80:15.39]I mean, this is where you usually get the banner.
[80:18.39]What is she going to give us instead?
[80:19.31]Uh-huh.
[80:25.37]Uh-huh.
[80:26.41]Blessed gem.
[80:32.73]I can't believe we have to find this stupid fucking thing somewhere in this entire zone.
[80:38.67]It's the marching I'm telling you.
[80:41.84]But then we have to find out.
[80:42.88]Uh-oh.
[80:46.18]Uh-oh.
[80:47.62]Oh, this is a big uh-oh.
[80:49.48]Uh-oh.
[80:50.68]Can you move?
[80:53.24]No.
[80:53.68]Like, you can't go back?
[80:56.58]Nope.
[80:57.16]Oh, okay, now I can.
[80:58.36]Hold on.
[81:02.74]Okay, let's fight her.
[81:04.14]Okay.
[81:07.40]I have no Estus.
[81:18.35]Rubbish.
[81:19.93]Why did I just get an achievement?
[81:22.70]I don't know.
[81:29.80]I don't think that opened the door.
[81:32.52]Doesn't that usually spawn the dancers?
[81:36.36]No, that's later.
[81:39.17]I know that you could always fight the dancers here.
[81:42.09]We might have to show an item.
[81:44.21]We might have to use the dark sign.
[81:46.77]We might have to kill ourselves here.
[81:49.11]Yeah.
[81:50.25]I can't even use it.
[81:54.13]You might have to kick me out of your game.
[81:56.17]Oh, I could leave.
[81:58.19]You can leave.
[81:58.71]I can't.
[82:02.59]Okay.
[82:03.57]Wait, maybe it'll do it in a second.
[82:04.87]I need to walk up to the statue.
[82:13.48]Yeah, I walked up to the statue and then I just walked out.
[82:15.98]I don't know.
[82:24.55]Behind chair.
[82:26.49]Yeah, I didn't actually interact with anything.
[82:28.85]There's nothing here.
[82:29.89]Because we don't have the bowl or whatever.
[82:32.13]Yeah, there's no bowl.
[82:34.29]But then I could just walk out.
[82:35.85]I don't know what happened.
[82:37.20]Maybe you have to just kind of move over there.
[82:41.86]Oh, no, no.
[82:44.64]I guess you might have to dark sign.
[82:45.82]But you said you couldn't.
[82:48.22]Then you might just have to like leave and leave.
[82:50.22]Yeah.
[82:52.76]So I'm going to just pay in and I'll join again.
[82:55.08]Okay.
[82:57.02]Okay.
[82:57.34]Am I gone?
[83:02.69]Okay.
[83:08.11]Now I will join you.
[83:13.43]Let's see what happens.
[83:30.13]oh yeah I didn't actually click traverse the fog so maybe that's why I could leave what the hell I was able to just walk in I could spawn in a weird spot oh I'm like right next to you that's cool nice alright so
[83:54.89]Now we need to find the banner.
[83:58.19]We need to find the banner or probably the key to talk to the merchant.
[84:02.71]Yes.
[84:04.91]Start looking.
[84:05.61]Why does it look like you're being sponsored by a shampoo brand at Costco?
[84:20.48]Got him.
[84:22.43]What, like I... Well, that would be a pretty good sponsor to take is look at these fucking locks.
[84:30.27]I can run... Yes.
[84:32.02]Yes, honey, you're handsome.
[84:33.40]Don't listen to them.
[84:36.22]L'Oreal, shine.
[84:37.70]And this shampoo is great.
[84:39.28]Makes my hair super soft.
[84:41.26]Okay.
[84:43.04]I'm... Ster, you're gonna have to...
[84:54.68]I'm gonna have to what?
[84:56.24]Where'd you go?
[84:56.78]I went up the ladder.
[85:01.99]So isn't there that other path that goes up to a different bonfire?
[85:05.51]We probably need to find that.
[85:07.17]Yeah, I feel like we should have ran into that already.
[85:11.71]I think it's because we didn't cross this roof and we came down.
[85:14.61]I told us to go in that other area.
[85:22.04]Right?
[85:22.42]Or am I crazy?
[85:24.78]I think it's... Isn't it at the beginning?
[85:26.18]It's like at the start of the... You missed.
[85:40.00]Kill the deacon.
[85:40.54]I'm reading chat.
[85:47.05]What product do you use?
[85:48.57]I use Maui shampoo and conditioner, the coconut one.
[85:53.57]It's wonderful.
[85:55.66]how it keeps my hair nice and shiny and smooth alright how do yeah there's two bonfires I think we actually have to do the um the banner we don't have it but we need to find it yeah so how do we get to the other bonfire because we're going to run into things along the way and we need to get the key to go to the merchant the merchant can sell quest items
[86:22.00]Like quest items are going to be where other quest items normally would be for merchants.
[86:26.36]I'm going to die.
[86:30.74]Yeah, where did this guy come from?
[86:36.16]Nobody knows.
[86:37.82]Holy shit.
[86:39.77]I have one health.
[86:50.15]We're separated.
[86:52.57]I'm fighting this fucking guy with a blight sword.
[86:54.95]Shit.
[87:04.59]Yeah, we're very separated.
[87:07.01]AKA I'm fighting both the fucking big people.
[87:10.37]I have no healing.
[87:11.37]I have nothing.
[87:12.43]Whoa.
[87:22.06]Got it.
[87:22.28]How much health does this guy have?
[87:26.50]This guy's dead.
[87:28.24]No, the tall boy.
[87:31.39]A full HP.
[87:34.09]Okay.
[87:36.15]I cannot participate.
[87:41.93]Unless you let him reset and I can run by.
[87:44.14]Don't worry.
[87:48.56]Irm's got this.
[87:50.73]Oh, we got this.
[87:54.33]I'm not doing third person shit anymore.
[87:56.07]Why did I say that?
[87:58.19]Are you playing in first person?
[88:00.57]Spear.
[88:05.29]Cool, I'm scared.
[88:07.43]I have no health either.
[88:08.11]Oh yeah, I can do the lifesteal punch.
[88:20.19]You really only have one HP.
[88:21.29]That's true.
[88:35.32]If I could ever stand near someone that long.
[88:39.42]I think this is I think this is it.
[88:43.49]Yes, it is OK.
[88:44.45]There's the other one car.
[88:50.05]Let's go back to Firelink if we can this time.
[88:53.88]Problem is, is somebody at Firelink going to have?
[88:56.34]Okay, I'm coming with you.
[89:00.22]I just want to level to be able to equip a different weapon.
[89:03.29]There's a chest under the dragon.
[89:08.45]That is also true.
[89:19.27]Key items can be anywhere that's unmissable.
[89:28.01]What is, what is Eleonora?
[89:29.51]What even?
[89:32.41]Looks like a strength scaling.
[89:36.47]Has an HP leech on it as a cool move.
[89:41.79]Oh, I thought it'd be bigger.
[89:46.80]I don't think you can two hand it.
[89:50.21]Yeah, I don't know.
[89:50.61]It's not letting me.
[89:53.55]I got it into it.
[89:56.85]What's wrong with me?
[89:58.17]I don't know something wrong with you.
[90:00.04]Oh, I was holding why?
[90:15.26]Seems kind of cool.
[90:22.95]uh I want to get this back on using any of the things we picked up no not yet I'm waiting for the perfect item to drop the perfect item yep I'll know it when I see it uh okay and she wasn't selling like the key doesn't seem like it try the Estus blast build where you drink Estus while Ster fights the boss
[90:49.87]That one is actually pretty strong.
[90:52.11]I've seen it in a couple of Reddit threads about people doing it.
[90:56.95]You do 99 vigor and then you max out the Estus and then you get the... Yeah, and you get a little... You get a brace for your thumb.
[91:07.17]It's actually like a lot of pros do it.
[91:10.76]A thumb brace.
[91:11.96]Right, so when you press the heal button, you make sure that it gets a good contact on square every time.
[91:19.50]okay lots of people are saying this yeah uh we're gonna use our Titanite shards uh I'm I don't need I got nothing I want to upgrade yet by all means go for it would you get this cool weapon
[91:47.51]I don't remember.
[91:48.15]You've got a giant meat cleaver.
[91:51.06]I really am going to just kind of drink Estus while you fight things.
[91:57.30]I might switch later, but only a +2.
[92:02.60]Somebody said, girl, we see the mug.
[92:05.08]I have to keep putting up.
[92:12.17]I don't use face cam like ever anymore.
[92:13.93]When I have like something that I think is a stupid funny thing, I want to show it.
[92:22.76]Alright, you good?
[92:24.34]Yeah.
[92:25.46]What's the mug?
[92:26.02]It says world's best Elden Ring player.
[92:33.33]That's so sad.
[92:34.27]Which one are we going to?
[92:39.52]alright uh I I don't know we need the banner so we have to maybe unlock where would it not I I think it is the only possible place it could be is the merchant so we don't have the key to open that and I don't know where you would normally get that I thought that was in the other like side area that we went to with the dog and uh the dung pies let's go to go to fort I'm going to fort let's go backwards from fort oh you want to see the worm again
[93:10.27]oh yeah it could be under fire breathing dragon that is also true yep so yeah okay yeah let's go backwards to fire dream breather go to fire breathing dragon we'll see if it's there if not then uh then we'll just leave and that'll be it I have hair in my mouth
[93:40.86]I feel like it would have been easier to... It's very loud here.
[94:01.62]You were saying something?
[94:03.02]We're just going back to the other bonfire.
[94:05.22]Yeah, we are.
[94:09.26]No, I got stuck.
[94:14.52]You can kill things in one hit, so that's good.
[94:23.68]Young man.
[94:26.03]Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[94:29.49]Young man.
[94:31.93]Got you.
[94:34.30]I don't know any of the other words it's fun to stay at them I don't know the words either it's something like that
[95:00.34]okay alright we need to go to breathing dragon so it's the other way that's the until we go left right we just go do everything we just go left the furthest bonfire possible breathing dragon we got this
[95:29.74]Alright, it might be here.
[95:32.64]Yeah, I don't think we came up here.
[95:33.76]And then there's the upstairs.
[95:42.94]Wait, hold on.
[95:43.60]There's like a little thing.
[95:44.56]Alright.
[95:49.61]Alright, be careful.
[95:50.73]Alright, mister.
[95:51.57]We're going to beat it today.
[95:52.57]Where is it?
[95:54.35]Probably right up here.
[96:01.06]It's probably this item right here.
[96:05.34]Hand axe shit.
[96:06.96]That's a good one.
[96:08.14]That's a good one.
[96:09.28]We gotta go over there.
[96:11.66]What if we have to kill the dragon?
[96:14.50]Well, do we have to kill the dragon?
[96:15.68]I don't think so.
[96:17.63]No.
[96:29.83]Wait.
[96:33.28]I dropped down.
[96:34.96]Oh, you dropped down.
[96:40.64]Where did you drop down?
[96:41.36]If you go behind the dragon, there's a ledge to drop.
[96:49.33]Okay.
[96:55.94]Did you get the items on top of fire length?
[96:58.70]Would it be there though?
[96:59.78]It would only be in the zone, right?
[97:02.26]It could be anywhere.
[97:02.94]There's a key item before the thing.
[97:05.80]Oh shit.
[97:06.58]OK, so yeah, that's let's do this first.
[97:21.44]Where do we go from here?
[97:22.56]How do we get?
[97:24.58]This is one of the only zones that kind of confuses me every time I try to do it.
[97:27.62]We have to go to this section here.
[97:30.86]I think we go down one and then there's stairs up.
[97:39.12]Yeah.
[97:41.06]Okay, we need to go up the stairs, I believe.
[97:43.72]We haven't done that.
[97:44.84]Yep.
[97:45.70]Alright, so for the future, we can't... If there's a key item, we cannot skip any content at all.
[97:55.27]I just went up.
[97:56.73]Oh my God, never mind, I'm going down.
[97:58.43]Never mind.
[98:00.45]Okay, next threat.
[98:04.38]Wait, no, don't we need to get it to leave by going the other way?
[98:13.88]Alright, open the door.
[98:21.39]Where you at?
[98:22.55]I'm not.
[98:22.95]I'm getting mauled on the bottom of the stairs.
[98:27.73]I got Firelink Helm.
[98:32.15]Turn the game volume up.
[98:33.45]Dude, my game volume is at like 3 right now.
[98:35.62]I can't fix it.
[98:36.26]This is bad.
[98:40.64]This is bad.
[98:41.60]This is bad.
[98:44.08]Alright, it's not one of those items.
[98:48.60]That's a cool sword though.
[98:52.58]I'm the boogie boogie man.
[98:58.18]Alright.
[99:00.84]It's not there.
[99:01.54]What about over there?
[99:04.75]You look cool.
[99:11.91]Lift chamber key.
[99:13.25]There it is.
[99:13.63]Oh, yeah.
[99:15.39]Okay.
[99:17.01]But let's just explore the rest of this.
[99:22.78]it might be here now okay we got just put every door 100 it's on the merchant yeah which is down here
[99:46.67]Andax is pretty good, actually.
[99:47.91]That dragon needs to shut up.
[99:53.07]What is your in-game sound volume set to?
[99:55.39]Mine's set to like three and it's still blowing up my ears.
[99:57.87]It's like three or four.
[99:58.81]It's just louder than everything.
[100:20.37]Downstairs.
[100:21.71]Hey.
[100:28.31]It's locked.
[100:28.81]Alright.
[100:31.09]What?
[100:32.37]What key did we get?
[100:33.59]What key is this?
[100:37.66]Key to the underground lift.
[100:39.94]Key to the room of the lift that descends to the deepest dungeon in Lothric.
[100:47.28]of the elevator in the big round room?
[100:51.42]Under the second bonfire?
[100:52.82]Wait, what the fuck?
[100:56.45]Yeah, I don't recall where that is.
[101:00.33]It's behind you?
[101:02.01]Wait.
[101:04.09]It's in the tower that you're in.
[101:07.01]Really?
[101:07.69]Where the hell is it?
[101:13.71]Lock the door way past.
[101:14.93]I really don't remember anything else.
[101:21.28]Not in here, right?
[101:22.99]No.
[101:28.81]This door down here.
[101:29.73]OK, so what does that do?
[101:35.95]I don't remember this at all.
[101:43.22]The bottom floor of the bonfire building.
[101:49.18]oh what the hell is that I I have no healing oh that's another crystal wizard hey I got this alright I got we got this nice nice interrupt dude
[102:20.74]Okay, pretty easy one.
[102:22.22]It doesn't clone.
[102:24.56]Yes.
[102:25.74]Thank God.
[102:26.52]I think that should get a level up coin sound.
[102:30.66]Can you play like a coin sound for like Mario or something?
[102:38.13]Uh, I don't think I can through the mic.
[102:40.95]All I... Um... Uh... Uh...
[102:52.72]How do you have these?
[102:53.58]Uh, because I'm ready.
[102:55.42]I'm prepared.
[102:56.70]Oh yeah, you're so prepared without a Mario coin sound.
[102:59.04]Are you fucking stupid?
[103:03.13]You have like the Rick and Morty outro music, but you don't have a one-up sound effect.
[103:12.17]It doesn't come up that often.
[103:16.64]That makes me angry.
[103:21.92]Alright, let's go.
[103:24.48]I don't think they still have that, by the way.
[103:29.93]Like, five years later.
[103:31.11]That's been years.
[103:32.07]I'm... Alright, we gotta go out.
[103:33.99]I'm a bad boy.
[103:34.79]We can talk about it in private later.
[103:38.75]I'm a bad boy.
[103:40.01]Yeah?
[103:42.43]Okay.
[103:44.48]Talk about it in private?
[103:46.30]Yeah.
[103:47.58]If you want to scold me or anything.
[103:57.65]Alright, you know where you're going?
[103:59.55]No, where are we going?
[104:00.93]Oh, we just need to teleport back to the gorge.
[104:08.16]No, what are you doing?
[104:09.26]I was locked in.
[104:12.70]We need to go back up to the bonfire.
[104:14.32]I apologize.
[104:19.35]I'll never do it again.
[104:20.13]I'm sorry.
[104:20.67]I've been a bad boy.
[104:25.34]Hey, no, I saw your stream the other day and you, uh, for the record, you were crashing out.
[104:30.84]What?
[104:32.93]You were getting a little, you were getting a little spicy.
[104:36.17]How was I getting spicy?
[104:37.11]What did I do?
[104:38.03]I want an example.
[104:41.30]Um, what were you saying?
[104:42.54]Wait, this one, isn't this one skeleton?
[104:45.20]No, that's the other one.
[104:46.20]Oh, okay.
[104:50.85]How is it when you were playing that laundry game?
[104:53.53]Something about doing laundry just really brought out like some primal urges in you.
[105:00.20]How so I don't get I don't I don't I don't fully.
[105:04.34]Because I said I said like oh because I was saying I'll go yeah like um he's so drunk he doesn't remember no I oh he's like fucking right like this is a joke.
[105:14.84]It was a we were just messing around.
[105:18.46]Yeah, and then you got like stuck in the laundry machine and you said some really weird stuff.
[105:28.51]Are we skipping?
[105:30.79]Uh, sure.
[105:31.33]Unless you want to watch like the Joker.
[105:37.51]I feel like you would have a good Joker laugh.
[105:41.85]uh I mean I I'd have to I could par I could be a parakeet but I can't just conjure I don't know which joker there's a lot of different jokers like whatever your interpretation of that voice is when I say the joker um I don't know why do you think I'd have a good one I don't think I would I don't know I feel like you could do it pretty good I don't know
[106:08.72]He seems like he could do a be a he he here.
[106:10.96]That was a zero, by the way.
[106:12.40]Zero?
[106:12.80]Yeah, that was a zero.
[106:13.58]I don't know what makes a good Joker laugh.
[106:16.46]Let me.
[106:19.48]Oh, you show me.
[106:20.40]Where did you go?
[106:21.73]You think that you have the device that is underneath the table?
[106:31.07]It's too deep.
[106:31.71]You have to go like high for Joker.
[106:34.15]It's like a mix between low and high.
[106:35.67]Like it has to...
[106:38.26]You know, he's a real, he's a joker.
[106:40.12]He has to squeak a little bit.
[106:45.23]Where the hell did you go?
[106:46.39]I walked down the stairs.
[106:49.27]I'm playing the game.
[106:50.17]What?
[106:59.85]I don't see you.
[107:01.45]How do you?
[107:01.89]I'm downstairs.
[107:02.95]Am I being pranked?
[107:06.55]Are we desynced?
[107:09.11]Those are both awful.
[107:11.45]I don't see any of the enemies aggroed or anything.
[107:13.87]I just hear them dying.
[107:14.89]We might be these things.
[107:20.18]I don't think you're here.
[107:21.56]Alright, I'm going to let the bloodlust kill me.
[107:25.90]Let's get to the next bonfire.
[107:35.19]Wait, yeah, the bonfire is like right in here.
[107:37.86]we have to open the gate and kill all this this guy's not even in the game oh yeah something's wrong something is not right I I've seen the door open and close it's kind of like the spirit of you is here
[108:09.27]Uh, alright, I'm at the bonfire.
[108:12.69]I'm lighting the bonfire.
[108:13.65]Okay, I am not there.
[108:18.22]What if I sit at the bonfire?
[108:18.96]I have not opened the door yet.
[108:23.24]You mean like, what if you're... I'll be in in a second, hun.
[108:53.43]Steam Tuesday maintenance?
[108:55.31]Wait, no, it's not.
[108:56.33]Why the fuck do we always do this on a Tuesday?
[108:58.03]Is it really?
[109:00.35]But we're not even supposed to be like online.
[109:03.81]That shouldn't matter.
[109:06.25]I'm getting murdered by laughing later.
[109:10.19]I am getting annihilated.
[109:13.11]I'm dead.
[109:15.77]I got the bonfire.
[109:26.40]Steam has made we.
[109:27.62]Why do we always pick this exact time when steam does its maintenance every time?
[109:33.52]I don't know what his team do at prime time.
[109:36.54]Is the real question.
[109:38.17]It is 3 o'clock Pacific.
[109:41.54]Just 6 p.m.
[109:42.44]Eastern.
[109:42.76]This is when you get the telemarketer calls and you go, we're eating dinner right now.
[109:47.58]Like, excuse me.
[109:48.98]I'm going to die again.
[109:49.94]I'm stuck in a loop.
[109:57.41]I hope it doesn't reset the death counters.
[110:00.71]My screen says one for you.
[110:10.74]I'm going to disconnect from your world.
[110:12.70]I. Why I'm just permanently.
[110:17.10]Gaining bleed.
[110:18.78]Yeah, that was happening to me too.
[110:19.66]Alright, I'm going to pull up from your world.
[110:28.58]This band I got.
[110:29.49]I got wormed.
[110:30.31]Alright, I'm pulling out from here.
[110:35.55]My God that aggregate everybody.
[110:39.37]okay we're good oh there's a bonfire at the top here I didn't even know that did you get into the castle or did you just get to the Undead Settlement I have that bonfire so I don't know I guess are we waiting for steam maintenance how long does it usually take like like seven hours I think no it's like five minutes
[111:06.98]No, because they have to, like, update all of the Half-Life 1 deathmatch servers.
[111:11.26]They have to manually take... Yeah, each one.
[111:17.98]Imagine still having to do that shit.
[111:34.85]Each Counter-Strike server, yeah.
[111:47.86]Dude, Half-Life 3, Half-Life 3, check Steam.
[111:50.98]That shit's so old.
[111:54.54]Like, they have to take Steam down to upload Half-Life 3.
[111:57.98]It's that big.
[111:58.70]Dude, I would not be surprised.
[112:00.82]If literally Steam's front page, nobody could use it, and it just said, like, Half-Life 3 uploading.
[112:07.71]And it was the actual file being uploaded.
[112:09.77]Nobody could do anything but look at that screen.
[112:12.69]That'd be pretty cool.
[112:14.01]And then, like, everybody's screen kind of goes like... The G-Man comes on and he's like, hello, good morning, Steam users.
[112:21.93]That's, like, just as meta and weird.
[112:23.50]I think they would do something like that.
[112:26.14]And it takes four discs.
[112:29.04]You need four discs to play the game.
[112:30.70]Because the game itself is, like, 70 terabytes.
[112:36.92]Everybody gets the game for free.
[112:40.49]I'm at the bonfire.
[112:45.91]Uh, the announcement is transmitting.
[112:50.32]Welcome, Steam users.
[112:51.72]Click below my face.
[112:54.00]Below.
[112:54.48]To get your free copy of Half-Life 3.
[112:59.13]Oh my god, what would happen?
[113:00.27]Is he voiced by an AI now?
[113:03.85]Dude, 2025, please no.
[113:12.35]I feel like some country's government would have to make some kind of announcement it'd be like we're having some mad massive surge of traffic we we need to figure this out what's wrong uh you need to use the join a session I think again can we connect again I don't know are we back I'm sorry I interrupted I know you yelled at me before this to never do that again no session found
[113:46.54]I'm so sorry.
[113:50.14]Anybody got Steve running yet?
[114:02.14]Hold on, I'm going to call my dad.
[114:03.46]He works at Valve and he knows Gabe Newell.
[114:07.54]Oh, friends list back up for some people.
[114:09.07]Hold on.
[114:13.85]We restart the game.
[114:16.23]Oh,
[114:18.60]Oh.
[114:20.36]Oh.
[114:22.26]Your mic looks like a British Royal Guard.
[114:24.42]Is it fuzzy?
[114:31.40]I should maybe make it like a British guy.
[114:39.37]Alright.
[114:39.85]Maybe I'll restart the game.
[114:41.55]If that works.
[114:41.99]Alright.
[114:51.90]Should I too then?
[114:53.46]We probably both should.
[114:55.60]OK, just to be safe, just you know.
[114:58.98]I would say it's a good idea.
[115:00.76]Reconnect everything through Steam API and everything, whatever.
[115:07.09]Remember to launch with the weird launcher.
[115:09.85]I know, I know.
[115:14.65]Check and make sure you're on, like you have a connection to Steam.
[115:19.31]Are we good?
[115:20.07]I think I'm on.
[115:23.46]I think so.
[115:28.60]Looks like it.
[115:32.66]Oh!
[115:33.68]Elden Ring!
[115:35.36]Golden Ring!
[115:36.74]Dude, are you ready for Night Rain?
[115:40.46]Uh, very.
[115:41.16]Very ready.
[115:42.53]I've been training my body in various ways.
[115:45.47]Okay, I'm on Steam.
[115:46.63]Like, I might have a connection to it.
[115:49.29]Alright, let's check.
[115:49.77]Okay, I am opening the... the box.
[115:55.77]Open it.
[115:58.53]Opening the box server.
[116:02.87]Calibrating.
[116:10.44]Seems to be calibrated.
[116:11.32]Okay.
[116:17.00]I think I'm in.
[116:25.50]Alright.
[116:26.54]I'll try.
[116:26.94]Do you have a session open?
[116:29.26]Yeah.
[116:36.79]No session.
[116:38.75]No session.
[116:39.87]No session found.
[116:41.13]No session found.
[116:43.65]Well, what are we going to do about this?
[116:45.35]What do we do?
[116:49.75]What are we going to do about this?
[116:51.80]Maybe we have to restart Steam like in total, like the whole thing.
[116:57.58]Have him close your world.
[117:01.04]My world?
[117:01.60]Yeah, close your whole world.
[117:03.16]Close the world.
[117:04.84]Closing world.
[117:07.04]Which item does that?
[117:07.98]Make sure I'm not in one too or something.
[117:12.75]Hold on.
[117:13.09]Okay, I'm not in anything.
[117:21.99]Disband.
[117:27.40]steam just went back down people are saying come on gabe well that's that's too much power for one person to have all of steam we need like a council the nine
[117:55.99]Ster can't close his world because you are his world oh I brought him into this world and I can take him out I still haven't connected to steam though it looks like I have a connection uh any anything new in the Jermaverse I don't know um hey well Monster Rancher 2 you're gonna be in the Monster Rancher 2 tournament aren't you
[118:23.76]I have heard no details other than there is one and yes, I'll be there.
[118:26.62]Okay, it's going to be very simple.
[118:29.24]It's going to be probably 8 to 10 people.
[118:32.09]Everybody's going to get a monster.
[118:33.03]Do you know how the game works?
[118:35.89]Yeah, you put a disk in and you get a monster and you get a digital monster.
[118:39.49]Right, so everyone's going to get an unlock.
[118:41.67]So the way that Monster Rancher works is it kind of gates you from being able to have any monster.
[118:47.66]So if you pick a song that you like or if you put a CD in, if it's a monster that's not unlocked yet...
[118:52.52]The game goes, oh, sorry, you can't do that.
[118:54.68]We're going to do an unlock save file.
[118:56.68]So everyone's just going to get every potential monster that's possible.
[118:59.93]And the way that it works in the port or remaster is it's not a disk.
[119:05.67]You have to, it's just a song title.
[119:07.33]And if it's in the database, it'll be there.
[119:09.83]So what I want to do is I want people to pick their three favorite songs.
[119:14.07]So if you have three favorite songs, you're going to get three monsters.
[119:17.51]And you have to use the monsters connected to your favorite song.
[119:20.93]um so um where is this database coming from for songs it is just my favorite song isn't on there if your favorite song is not on there then you have to pick and go down the list well that would be dishonest they have a lot of stuff on there so okay I'll believe it so then you're gonna get you pick I might do so wait do you just lose the tournament if you get like a suzu
[119:49.81]It's how you train it.
[119:50.93]You're going to train it for... You're going to have to train it for a little while.
[119:54.59]There's just some that are significantly better.
[119:57.95]You know.
[119:59.34]That's debatable.
[120:01.78]Hey, if you get something good, then that's fine.
[120:03.98]That's why there's three.
[120:05.10]I guess you got three chances.
[120:06.50]You might as well try.
[120:07.38]What we'll probably do is maybe if you get... Everyone loves an underdog.
[120:09.80]If you get like a rare crazy one, then maybe you can only have up to one rare crazy one.
[120:17.05]And how do you win the tournament?
[120:18.17]Like, is there multiplayer for this?
[120:20.05]So the way the multiplayer works is whenever you get your monster, you're going to train it.
[120:25.07]There's going to be a very strict amount of weeks or years you can train the monster.
[120:29.48]So you'll train the monster for a set amount of years.
[120:32.60]you can do it however you want there's a lot of different avenues to to maybe mess with the system mess with other players you know that's I'm going to leave that up to everybody but okay then you up the the online you effectively just upload all of your monsters and then I go through and it's just a seed file that I just then put two monsters with two different seeds versus each other ah okay you're battling them I see okay and then they will be battled I will be showcasing the battles
[121:04.25]Has to be a song from before 2001.
[121:05.27]Is that true?
[121:06.05]Alright, should we try this one more time?
[121:13.62]Yeah.
[121:15.56]Oh, so we're only allowed to have oldies.
[121:17.10]Well, it's going to be... I'll think of the possibilities, but that's the idea.
[121:24.02]I'm going to close my world again real quick and then reopen.
[121:28.44]I already forgot what the item was.
[121:30.95]Apparently the remaster has like a ton of new songs, so that's good.
[121:38.75]Bro.
[121:48.00]It has SpongeBob songs, really?
[121:49.76]I heard the Mr. Krabs rap.
[121:57.46]It might.
[121:57.72]I don't know something like the honor.
[121:58.89]That's that's a banger.
[122:02.41]His name is Eugene.
[122:03.95]You know you've you've heard this.
[122:05.21]Everybody's heard this.
[122:13.13]I'm coming up on a hour.
[122:14.61]Coming up on a break here in about three minutes.
[122:16.19]How are you doing?
[122:19.07]Four minutes.
[122:20.39]So we're good.
[122:22.47]Let's hope that by the time we get back, this will be fixed and we can continue because I was actually just getting into this.
[122:28.67]I was getting really excited about this.
[122:31.09]I was just getting into it.
[122:33.99]Yeah, I think what you could you can run the ad now and it'll like postpone the next one and we can both do that.
[122:39.22]It will not.
[122:42.17]It says that if it's if it's close to the ad time, sometimes it works.
[122:47.23]I tried this last time and I ended up having 7 minutes of ads play at one time and I said I'm not doing that again.
[122:52.54]OK, yeah, I also feel like that's also a possibility that had happened before.
[122:57.38]I don't want to do that again.
[123:02.76]Weird.
[123:05.00]Come on Jeff.
[123:07.52]Alright.
[123:09.97]You got a session?
[123:11.76]Yeah, come on.
[123:16.05]No session.
[123:19.09]You want to try hosting the purple crystal?
[123:22.19]Alright, create a seamless co-op session.
[123:29.26]It apparently is active.
[123:41.68]Huh?
[123:45.34]Did you do it?
[123:45.98]No session found.
[123:47.48]I did it.
[123:49.60]I think we're going to have to just log out of here.
[123:52.75]Restart steam and then try it again.
[123:56.05]So we got breaks coming up here.
[123:58.05]We'll just sorry.
[123:58.89]Sorry chatters.
[123:59.93]Yeah, sorry guys.
[124:00.81]But hey, it actually I think we're going to be fine.
[124:02.55]I think it's gonna work.
[124:08.39]So, uh.
[124:10.99]It's weird.
[124:12.18]You could be the strongest superhero possible.
[124:14.26]You could be like Captain America and you'd still have to stop playing Dark Souls co-op right now.
[124:20.32]How strong does that make Gabe Newell?
[124:23.92]If Thor is sitting here right now, he's like, Hey Cap, can you log in?
[124:30.11]No, I can't log in.
[124:33.11]They are both worthy of lifting Mjolnir and they still can't play.
[124:36.07]Okay.
[124:40.64]Alright, let's just go BRB for a few minutes.
[124:42.78]We'll figure this out.
[124:46.36]BRB.
[124:48.61]I'm just going to be sitting here while we figure it out, but ads are going to be playing.
[124:52.43]Alright, I'm going to restart everything.
[124:53.73]Let's restart shit.
[125:01.28]Get out of this.
[125:01.90]Get out of Steam.
[125:07.14]Steam.
[125:09.20]Alright.
[125:09.62]I have exited steam, exited everything.
[125:12.68]Okay.
[125:18.16]There's one of those moments where like they update Dark Souls three for the first time in a year.
[125:23.09]Yeah.
[125:23.71]Just to fix like a typo to fix like an, like a localization typo in like one of the menus.
[125:37.74]I was gonna say, did you just punch a wall?
[125:40.80]I'm so fucking mad about this.

[128:17.97]Here's the thing.
[128:19.33]Who's who?
[128:20.59]I actually don't know.
[128:22.83]Daffy Duck and Donald Duck?
[128:24.59]Yeah.
[128:28.55]Would you be Daffy or would you be Donald?
[128:31.31]I can't make words.
[128:34.81]I could be Baby Duck.
[128:37.10]There's a lot of debate right now in the chats.
[128:44.91]Wait, did you say you could do a baby duck?
[128:47.39]No, I said I could be baby duck.
[128:55.54]Isn't Daffy like an absolute menace to society?
[128:58.36]I mean, Daffy's just... No, Daffy always has like some good points and he gets looked over because people think he's goofy and crazy.
[129:11.22]Oh, Bugs Bunny.
[129:11.92]He's the smart one.
[129:14.74]You would be Bugs Bunny, wouldn't you?
[129:16.58]Yeah, fuck you.
[129:17.28]You would be Bugs Bunny.
[129:18.62]Wait, what the fuck does that mean?
[129:21.16]Bugs is like the protagonist, though.
[129:22.98]He's always fucking with me, always like putting the finger in the shotgun and like blowing my face off and putting the soda off my face.
[129:29.07]You do that.
[129:31.15]I do.
[129:31.41]I do, actually.
[129:40.50]people saying I would be bugs no way he's way too cool and collected um he is not smart enough to be bugs you know there's different kinds of intelligence there's emotional intelligence there's social intelligence there's comedy intelligence there's performance intelligence there's there's a lot of different intelligence and I'm hoping he's making up other intelligences no there's extraterrestrials I could be one of those
[130:06.99]Hey, my emotional intelligence and social intelligence is actually very high.
[130:10.94]Test it.
[130:12.56]You ready?
[130:13.02]Test it?
[130:13.66]You want to do a test?
[130:15.92]No, I'm good.
[130:16.92]Streamer intelligence.
[130:22.47]Well, actually, this me saying this, bringing this up is something that Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck would bring up.
[130:28.55]Yeah, and then I would put the finger in your gun and you'd kill yourself.
[130:43.50]Alright, we have to fucking play.
[130:46.74]I need to rest.
[130:47.76]I drank a flask.

[133:11.48]I do not have this guy.
[133:12.38]Never mind.
[133:14.70]This is like a little late game enemies.
[133:16.16]This guy's in like the last part of the game.

[133:28.92]I'm fine.
[133:32.06]Wait, am I in the game still?
[133:33.72]Yeah.
[133:35.99]I rested with the bonfire.
[133:37.05]They reset.
[133:38.33]Oh.
[133:39.77]I thought you were going to get re-surrounded.
[133:43.54]There's still so much shit down here though.
[133:50.85]They're all okay.
[133:51.89]What do we do about this?
[133:53.23]And can you bring something for me?
[133:54.53]Can you bring some like extra heals or something?
[133:57.07]I cannot bring heals.
[133:58.81]I can't.
[133:59.17]I'm going to have to resurrect everything again.
[134:01.17]Wait, I just got a... Thank you.
[134:02.87]Damn.
[134:05.10]Got a what?
[134:06.10]I just got a free heal.
[134:08.10]Okay.
[134:10.22]Where are you?
[134:11.24]You can come back to the bonfire.
[134:12.36]We need to approach this a little bit slower.
[134:15.03]Yes.
[134:16.99]Where are you?
[134:19.33]I can come help.
[134:26.90]Saved you.
[134:27.86]Nice.
[134:28.72]You owe me one.
[134:29.36]Okay, you approached this correctly.
[134:41.59]I'll get the one on the left.
[134:46.60]Alright, we're aggroing everything.
[134:47.74]I'll get them both.
[134:48.46]I'll get them both.
[134:55.33]we got the little like weirdo and the weirdo is starting to get annoyed it looks like one of the clay monsters I made by the way again I don't know what it is today but I I get people saying things look like me a lot and it's like no not really but like this this guy looks like you he looks like golem his face he actually does look like golem oh yeah okay he's gonna turn his head thanks he can look like golem from below the ring
[135:26.39]gonna turn just gonna turn check him I just that does not look anything like me that look that no it does not what the the you haven't shown your extra like side arm on stream yet you still shy about that go up
[135:52.31]Exile armor?
[135:53.29]Not an exile.
[135:55.32]The future device.
[135:56.50]The future thing that you know.
[135:57.50]Exile.
[135:58.78]I'm going home.
[135:59.80]You might have saved me.
[136:00.58]I did.
[136:04.96]Your discretions would be... This guy is strong.
[136:08.13]This guy is strong.
[136:09.51]Yeah.
[136:10.41]We're fine.
[136:14.71]We're fine.
[136:16.32]Fine Andy.
[136:20.57]I am running out of stamina so quick.
[136:27.03]Is it just me?
[136:28.09]Do you also spin in a circle while you drink your Estus every time?
[136:30.90]Any Estus spinners?
[136:36.54]Oh, we got a spider.
[136:38.07]I don't...
[136:42.75]Yeah, that one kind of looked like you.
[136:43.71]Dude, I have a fucking idea.
[136:46.49]I think I could... I keep turning this down and the game is just... I'm at two and the game is still that loud.
[137:00.01]That looks like you.
[137:02.17]It's been two hours.
[137:03.67]You just had the idea to turn the volume down when the volume was loud.
[137:08.25]I've turned it down like five different times over the course of the stream.
[137:10.91]Have you been watching my broadcast?
[137:13.42]If the sound started at a three, like you said, and you turned it down five times, it would be at a negative two.
[137:19.12]You don't know shit.
[137:26.48]Actually...
[137:37.13]How's that?
[137:38.01]Now that sounds like, that's like too low.
[137:44.83]Yeah, that's too low.
[137:52.82]I think three is okay.
[137:55.86]Yeah, we're fine.
[138:01.22]Piromancy Tome.
[138:03.24]I might do pyromancy.
[138:04.32]That might be me.
[138:07.00]Is that a horse?
[138:13.12]What is this horse?
[138:17.19]Oh, it's a...
[138:34.33]Very different animal, actually.
[138:38.23]Very different.
[138:45.47]And behind us.
[138:47.78]I didn't mean to click.
[138:52.78]I need another Estes or like more Estes.
[138:55.36]I tried to Daffy Duck you there.
[138:58.40]The Daffy Duck me.
[138:59.66]I did.
[139:04.94]This thing kind of looks like you.
[139:07.28]Which thing?
[139:08.52]Outside.
[139:14.92]No, that's definitely you.
[139:16.18]That looks way more like you than me.
[139:18.66]That's you.
[139:22.17]That's a Ster.
[139:22.89]He's got me.
[139:27.99]He's got me.
[139:28.67]I'm going to die.
[139:33.70]I'm alive.
[139:34.56]Kill it while it's... You can't.
[139:37.50]What do you mean you can't?
[139:41.41]You can't attack it when it's in the animation.
[139:54.86]You do it.
[139:56.08]I have no health either.
[139:57.94]You do it.
[139:58.38]No, you fight him.
[140:00.04]You fight.
[140:01.14]I'll do it.
[140:02.24]Fine, I'll do it.
[140:04.01]One at a time.
[140:05.59]I'm dead.
[140:20.10]He just rolled away.
[140:21.24]He rolled out of bed.
[140:22.08]That was a perfect freeze frame.
[140:33.72]Oh, you got fucking crushed.
[140:37.38]Rough, rough zone.
[140:39.08]Let's go.
[140:41.81]Can I?
[140:42.29]OK, can I take the Tin Man axe off?
[140:44.19]This thing doesn't do anything.
[140:46.21]You can use any weapon you want.
[140:48.11]I know, but like, why is that thing so shitty?
[140:55.22]You guys are bad at video games.
[140:56.48]You're professional video gamers.
[140:58.02]That's a hand monster in Undead Burg.
[141:01.13]We might have to rest because we died at different times.
[141:03.21]No one rested to respawn everything and it's cheating.
[141:07.41]Clearly cheating.
[141:12.75]They only said your name.
[141:14.09]Yeah, but I said I could.
[141:17.55]We're both playing together, so we're both sharing the burden here.
[141:25.63]He dropped to 90,000 souls.
[141:26.95]I don't deserve them.
[141:27.77]The game keeps giving them to me for free.
[141:30.64]Why do you have 90,000?

[142:00.10]Because it's a randomizer drama.

[144:42.11]That's a little too far.
[144:43.96]Yeah, I went there.

[144:52.19]I know I'm just it's not me saying why is that guy here?
[144:56.38]Oh my God, it's a randomized mod.
[144:58.50]It's me going like why is that guy here?
[145:00.74]Like whoa was a guy here.
[145:02.96]I know that's a randomized.

[145:07.16]I get it.
[145:09.62]He says the same thing when he sits down to a restaurant in the waiter walks over.
[145:16.52]What?
[145:18.76]What do you want?
[145:22.16]Alright, watch out for the hand.

[145:50.64]Nice job, dude.
[145:57.63]Did we get everything?
[145:59.67]I believe so.
[146:01.82]Operation successful.
[146:10.74]This area sucks, by the way.
[146:12.90]This area in particular is not that great.
[146:14.88]This area sucks.
[146:21.04]It gets better in like 40 to 50 hours.
[146:22.76]That fist is very strong.
[146:24.58]It actually is.
[146:25.14]Oh, Wolnir's crown.
[146:33.07]oh this thing's good too this this item is like one of the rewards you get for beating um getting over it or Jump King oh nice alright we played chain together and I beat it it could be a crunchy on there
[146:56.40]You're going to have to hit it.
[146:57.28]You're going to have to hit it, pal.
[146:58.36]I have the fist.
[147:01.12]You have the gigantic 10 foot long weapon.
[147:03.24]Alright, where do you want to go?
[147:09.18]Up or down?
[147:13.36]I don't know.
[147:13.90]I think we're looking for every item.
[147:21.45]Do you like?
[147:21.85]Hold on.
[147:25.33]You just pop at me.
[147:27.05]Do you like your play Chrono Trigger?
[147:31.93]I have not.
[147:34.91]I'm going to put that on.
[147:35.41]I'm going to put points in.
[147:36.21]I'm going to do fire.
[147:39.61]I'll do pyromancy.
[147:41.41]OK.
[147:44.79]You never played Chrono Trigger?
[147:47.11]I did not.
[147:48.07]I've seen there's this guy on Twitch has been streaming it lately.
[147:52.31]Thought a little bit of it.
[147:54.72]Yeah.
[147:56.81]What do you think?
[147:59.37]Um, it looks really cool how they integrate the fights into the actual area rather than, you know, going into a different scene.
[148:07.70]Never saw that.
[148:08.40]That's pretty cool.
[148:12.02]Yep.
[148:13.38]Yep.
[148:13.96]Uh, yeah.
[148:15.56]Looking for more?
[148:16.76]Was that good?
[148:18.10]No, I just need to validate my opinions if somebody has to tell me that it's good.
[148:21.87]So I go, yep.
[148:23.25]I don't know much about it, but what I can tell you is I hate any plot that has time travel.
[148:28.08]How are we feeling on a time travel plot in this game in the Chrono Trigger?
[148:32.36]It's very good.
[148:33.38]It's very nice.
[148:34.28]It's not super heavy handed.
[148:35.91]It's just cool.
[148:37.89]It was one of the first games that really let you do stuff like that.
[148:42.09]It's one of the OGs.
[148:48.47]Yeah, mad respect for the OGs.
[148:52.52]The world changes and there's lots of cool things to see in each one of the ages.
[149:00.80]You're currently playing a game that has a time travel plot.
[149:07.82]This game does not have plot.
[149:10.59]This game hasn't had plot since you could see Gwenon's feet.
[149:22.53]So in Chrono Trigger, they had a sequel called Chrono Cross.
[149:28.68]That game is fucked.
[149:30.24]Wait, are we going to get stuff thrown at us?
[149:32.56]Or is he like a hollow?
[149:34.10]Yeah, he's up there.
[149:37.23]Oh, nice.
[149:37.63]Alright, he's helpful.
[149:40.05]There's that one thing.
[149:41.13]There's a loot around here that drops like the whole armor set.
[149:45.43]We might get a bunch of items from.
[149:46.63]I came to help and now I'm suffering your same ailment.
[150:04.31]Way to go.
[150:06.61]Estashard.
[150:08.70]Oh, shit.
[150:09.64]Oh, Estashard.
[150:10.52]We had an Estashard.
[150:12.04]Are you?
[150:12.36]Oh, we got this.
[150:15.98]Why is he throwing him at me still?
[150:17.58]Why was he locked to me?
[150:21.20]Because I was hiding in the back.
[150:25.93]Do we have an antidote?
[150:28.41]I don't think so.
[150:40.52]You safe?
[150:42.08]Yeah.
[150:47.38]Are you resting?
[150:48.68]No, I'm... I'm trying to pick up all the fucking items.
[150:51.62]I'm fat rolling right now, and I didn't even realize it until right now.
[150:58.25]Golden Falcon Shield.
[150:59.39]What the heck?
[151:06.33]What the hell killed me?
[151:10.20]Huh?
[151:11.58]Where are you?
[151:12.30]Did you get hit by the spear?
[151:15.66]I'm on the top of the hill just waiting.
[151:17.26]I need to get this shit off.
[151:22.51]That's why I'm rolling.
[151:26.13]There we go.
[151:26.99]Finally.
[151:32.05]Did you pick all this stuff up while I was getting killed?
[151:35.21]Uh, yes.
[151:36.23]I did not get the Estus Shard though.
[151:50.21]I'm just trying to get all this shit.
[151:54.59]Alright, we're good.
[151:55.61]There's a guy in the doorway.
[151:56.65]He's quite big.
[151:57.83]That guy killed me in one hit, so be careful.
[152:03.30]There's usually a cool item in here.
[152:12.10]Oh my goodness.
[152:12.90]What the fuck is going on?
[152:22.32]I need to get that Estus Shard.
[152:23.48]Yeah, go get it.
[152:24.76]I'll wait for you.
[152:26.20]Is it like down on the jump?
[152:27.94]You got to jump over, yeah.
[152:29.44]Ooh.
[152:32.60]Sunset shield here.
[152:35.06]I picked, I got everything.
[152:35.76]Gloves.
[152:37.92]Yeah, I did not get all this.
[152:39.82]We'll have to look at that later.
[152:41.00]He just stopped shooting.
[152:43.20]Yeah, good.
[152:44.18]Have fun.
[152:44.53]Go get it without any trouble at all.
[152:52.80]I'm glad you got it.
[152:53.56]OK.
[152:56.36]OK, let's go.
[153:01.76]Most of my friends here as well.
[153:13.11]Yeah, bunch of stuff over on the right side I didn't get, but sorry.

[155:19.97]Alright, so what would be your favorite song that you'd be trying to get a monster on?
[155:24.47]I'd have to really think about it, because if you pick the wrong favorite song, you'll be judged.
[155:29.08]That's true.
[155:29.40]I already know what one of mine is.
[155:32.44]And you can't steal it.
[155:34.16]Crystal Lizard, Crystal Lizard, Crystal Lizard.

[155:43.39]Oh my goodness.
[155:44.23]He's no sound effect lizard.

[160:08.13]Oh.
[160:08.73]Okay.
[160:51.86]I can't really help.
[160:52.84]I'm the music guy.
[160:54.64]Come on then.
[160:55.06]Give me some music.
[160:56.20]You be the DJ.
[160:56.96]I can't do both.
[160:58.40]I can't do both.
[160:59.32]Be the DJ.
[161:00.50]I got this.
[161:01.70]I only have like four songs.
[161:03.46]Play one of the other ones.
[161:18.41]Ooh, actually good.
[161:22.91]What the fuck?
[161:27.92]Okay, we're alive.
[161:32.12]We got this.
[161:35.08]Home with bone.
[161:37.36]Bugs.
[161:40.69]Oh, I thought another boss would spawn.
[161:48.40]Okay, now you want to go to Firelink?
[161:51.28]Yes.
[161:51.88]Now let's go to Firelink and figure it out.
[162:04.60]You're looking real cute in that outfit.
[162:06.28]Somebody said that I've got grease on my webcam.
[162:08.25]I'll wipe it off after the next break.
[162:11.27]I think it's just blurry webcam.
[162:12.39]That's it.
[162:13.38]That's it.
[162:13.64]That's all.
[162:13.96]That's the way it's going to be.
[162:16.24]That's just it.
[162:16.88]That's it.
[162:17.90]Alright.
[162:18.96]I'm going to do.
[162:20.40]I'm doing pyromancy.
[162:22.58]So I need to do faith, right?
[162:24.26]Was it faith in?
[162:24.93]Um, I don't know.
[162:29.87]I guess I think.
[162:33.17]Pyromancy is parting flame.
[162:41.38]Wait, I can refill my Estus with this thing?
[162:43.71]That sounds kind of cool.
[162:49.23]I need... You need strength, faith, and intelligence? ...
[163:13.74]You have a 1080p webcam that's being cropped to 240 pixels.
[163:22.51]Yes, that's what's going on.
[163:23.37]That's just the way it is.
[163:27.41]Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[163:28.03]You could also allot your Estus to remove the mana.
[163:31.91]Okay, I need more.
[163:34.13]Why did I put 30 points in fucking endurance?
[163:35.80]It was the stupidest thing I've ever done.
[163:46.06]Didn't I get a bunch of like soul things?
[163:50.11]Yeah.
[164:10.92]I use webcam like three times a year.
[164:13.62]We also did pick up a ring that gave faith.
[164:15.86]Yeah.
[164:17.24]We did, didn't we?
[164:22.15]What do these undead bone shards even do?
[164:25.85]You burn them for recovery amount.
[164:29.81]If you sit down with the fire right now, you can burn them.
[164:33.14]I mean, I'm burning.
[164:33.88]I just didn't know what they did.
[164:39.39]Pretty sick.
[164:40.11]Alright, I've got 15 faith.
[164:41.43]I need... I need two, three more points.
[164:47.73]Actually, I wonder what the Giga Chad song gives in Monster Rancher.
[164:52.52]That could be the winning play.
[164:54.06]That could be true, yeah.
[165:00.92]Do we get any pyromancies?
[165:02.86]I don't think so.
[165:03.72]We've got a lot of sorceries.
[165:04.95]There's not a lot of pyromancy.
[165:07.62]in the game in general compared to sorceries.
[165:10.06]This one counts.
[165:11.36]Blackfire orb.
[165:12.16]I need 20 intelligence.
[165:17.53]We'll find it eventually.
[165:22.37]I'll level this one up.
[165:23.13]It's possible we don't ever see anything else besides these.
[165:28.03]We're getting a lot of Titanite as well.
[165:31.69]Can I not upgrade this?
[165:35.57]Wait.
[165:36.13]Okay.

[182:09.55]My statement on Quiznos is I think it's a good restaurant and I think it's a delicious sauce and I think they put good food and good quality ingredients.
[182:16.49]That's not me saying that.
[182:19.64]I've heard some people say that it's people meat in the sandwiches.
[182:22.80]Is that true?
[182:24.68]I think Quiznos has good quality ingredients and I think it's a good family-run restaurant and that is my statement on Quiznos.
[182:32.93]OK, well, I've just heard things and I'm just asking questions.
[182:35.91]We need to find the guy in the cell.
[182:46.19]Coming up on a break in two minutes, by the way.

[183:51.74]In history?
[183:52.82]No, nobody else did it.
[183:53.84]It was annoying.
[183:54.50]It was... You would get these just limpy-ass, cold-ass sandwich from everybody else.
[183:59.29]It was bullshit.
[183:59.87]Can I... Can I... I know that you're an enjoyer of all things, and this is just going to be another, like, Ster-hates-everything.
[184:08.55]Okay.
[184:09.71]But I think this is the worst food place in existence.
[184:14.04]And if there's any defenders of it, I'd be shocked.
[184:16.94]Okay.
[184:19.68]I forgot the name.
[184:22.78]Was it Timmy Hortons or something?
[184:27.14]What's it called?
[184:27.70]Timothy's Horton.
[184:28.66]Tim Hortons.
[184:29.68]Tim Hortons.
[184:31.79]Okay.
[184:33.37]Let's hold that thought.
[184:34.17]It's like cardboard bread.
[184:35.97]And then there's like one thin slice of meat.
[184:38.77]And I don't know.
[184:39.63]I've heard this from... It might not be true, but I've heard that it's people meat.
[184:43.69]Stop saying that about places.
[184:46.92]I didn't say that.
[184:48.04]I said it.
[184:48.92]I've heard that.
[184:49.72]I'm not sure if that's true.
[184:50.74]Is that true?
[184:51.92]Alright, I got a break here.
[184:53.52]I'll be back in three minutes, four minutes.
[184:55.22]And then we'll do yours and then we can fucking keep talking about meat.
[184:58.60]Okay.
[185:04.05]I actually might just take like a couple bites out of a sandwich I have in the fridge.
[185:06.43]I'll be right back.
[185:08.55]Yeah, I wonder what's in that.
[185:23.12]Guys, I'm sorry if anybody liked Timothy Horton's.
[185:32.45]You have to understand that I'm an American.
[185:36.41]And it's not a real sandwich unless it's a triple cheeseburger.
[185:46.09]And they don't have those there.

[187:45.26]It doesn't matter what I say.
[187:46.30]I just start saying I'm sorry more often.
[187:48.80]I'm sorry.
[187:52.89]That's my bad.
[187:53.53]I'm gonna apologize to Tim Hortons.

[192:16.11]Nice.
[192:19.55]I hope he gives us like a spoon.
[192:22.41]Oh, no.
[192:22.65]Did you go back to Firelink?
[192:23.96]You did?
[192:24.30]I think you went back to Firelink.
[192:28.66]Thank you.
[192:33.07]Okay, you made fun of me for like a minute.
[192:39.77]Forget about it.
[192:40.63]Forget about it.
[192:41.55]I think we have to go back to Firelink Shrine to get you your pyromancy guy.
[192:48.88]Who's probably not even going to sell pyromancies.
[192:53.08]Okay.
[192:54.52]So let me defend myself for a minute.
[192:56.72]I...
[193:00.82]My favorite is brisket.
[193:02.80]And... No, I think that all these establishments we're talking about have quality ingredients.
[193:09.77]And they make
[193:12.49]They make their food fresh and I think they're good.
[193:15.13]I've never had Tim Hortons before.
[193:16.49]I've heard it sucks.
[193:18.28]I don't know anything.
[193:19.62]Where did you hear that from?
[193:20.46]I've never said that.
[193:21.92]You just said it and then I've seen people go like Tim Hortons sucks.
[193:25.68]I've said that other people think that.
[193:28.54]People saying brand deal, brand deal Andy.
[193:32.14]Don't ever talk shit about... Here's the thing.
[193:34.64]I've talked shit about a lot of brands that I've maybe... Like, there's maybe been an opportunity where I've thought about, like, oh, maybe I'll work with them one day.
[193:43.01]And then you look at, like, wait a minute.
[193:44.11]This clip's of me talking about how much this company sucks.
[193:47.45]No, we're not doing that.
[193:48.65]I can't say... I'm not doing... What if, like, one day I want to, like, eat a fucking sub on stream?
[193:56.35]Oh, hey, guys.
[193:56.76]Today we're going to be playing Bloodborne.
[193:58.44]Oh, Remastered just came out, and this is sponsored by Nabisco.
[194:02.57]That's not happening.
[194:06.81]Oh, it's this guy.
[194:07.45]Hmm.
[194:13.58]Another one of the old.
[194:15.10]It looks a little different than I remember here in this land of hollows.
[194:20.80]You're like a frail maiden on the front lines.
[194:23.40]It's going to be loud.
[194:24.06]I'm sorry.
[194:24.72]I'm trying to like not make it loud.
[194:26.30]The others, you're fool enough to play the champion.
[194:31.21]On camera?
[194:32.99]Bush light.
[194:34.29]Bush light.
[194:36.29]Should I be concerned?
[194:37.63]I don't want to be loud.
[194:39.29]This guy gets crazy.
[194:40.31]One bush light in this guy?
[194:42.65]He's blowing a 30 on the breathalyzer.
[194:47.05]That's enough to have like fucking 20 people dead.
[194:53.41]It's just your body chemistry.
[194:55.53]It's just different.
[194:56.27]You're built different.
[194:56.75]A blood alcohol of 30?
[194:57.69]That's like 50 people.
[195:02.26]It gets a little spicy.
[195:05.32]The can isn't more focused than your face.
[195:07.34]What?
[195:17.81]What are you talking about?
[195:18.59]Oh, it's Sigward.
[195:35.25]So we go up.
[195:37.51]We have to take this down, don't we?
[195:42.71]Are we going to do a little mini game?
[195:44.59]We can go up.
[195:46.53]Right, so get off.
[195:51.58]Do a little upy.
[195:53.50]Product placement.
[195:54.66]I'm drinking a Coca-Cola.
[195:57.14]Sorry.
[195:57.44]I have to apologize for having a product on my screen.
[196:03.97]Does this shit happen to you?
[196:08.67]No.
[196:09.05]What?
[196:09.37]What's happening?
[196:10.43]They're making me apologize for having a product.
[196:12.73]I have a product placement on stream.
[196:14.01]I'm drinking a Coke.
[196:15.68]Well, I don't do that.
[196:17.36]You don't drink Coke?
[196:19.06]No.
[196:19.20]When I turn on my stream, I do not go to the bathroom.
[196:21.82]I do not have food.
[196:24.02]What are you doing?
[196:26.56]Why are you killing him?
[196:28.82]Isn't he the bad guy?
[196:30.40]You talked to him.
[196:31.64]Have you ever played this game before?
[196:35.17]Now we have to kill him.
[196:36.75]No, just... Where did you go?
[196:43.70]I'm behind him.
[196:44.50]Are we killing him?
[196:46.34]You're killing him, not me.
[196:47.64]I'm not getting the colon defaces.
[196:49.96]Okay.
[196:50.92]Well, let me sharpen this up.
[197:00.03]Dude, they just took this guy out of Elden Ring.
[197:03.25]They've retextured him.
[197:08.42]Oh, dude, like, I can't wait to watch this 50-hour lore video.
[197:11.60]Why is this guy in Elden Ring?
[197:12.96]It's because this model existed in Dark Souls 3.
[197:17.04]And they just didn't have anything else on hand.
[197:21.87]No, there's a lore reason.
[197:23.93]Shut up.
[197:32.96]You didn't do it.
[197:34.62]Oh, I forgore.
[197:36.93]This is where we get the cool part.
[197:39.77]You're going to have to jump down.
[197:41.61]Apparently we missed an item up top.
[197:46.59]Okay, I'm coming back up.
[197:47.51]Coming back up.
[197:53.30]Mister, we're going to beat this today.
[197:56.28]Where are you?
[197:57.72]You didn't jump.
[198:00.56]Yeah, I thought you were going to get back on it.
[198:04.48]Go see what the item is.
[198:06.12]If it sucks, then come back.
[198:07.06]I'm going to jump.
[198:14.77]Ooh, Lorian's Helm.
[198:20.79]What item?
[198:23.53]There's no item.
[198:24.20]I look cold.
[198:28.88]I've been one-manned.
[198:33.40]apparently they lied to me which inadvertently lied to you no that was just like there was like a piece behind the elevator yeah no that was dust it's gonna be rubbish so who cares are you coming
[198:53.90]That almost wasn't good.
[198:55.88]Alright, so what are we fighting?
[199:05.14]It looks like a ninja turtle.
[199:07.65]Alright, let's do it.
[199:11.27]You need to heal, man.
[199:12.31]You have to heal.
[199:13.85]You have no health.
[199:14.87]Oh my god.
[199:17.81]Who did that to me?
[199:20.89]No, you should have waited.
[199:21.97]I, Siegward.
[199:24.67]I, Siegward.
[199:25.89]I, Siegward.
[199:27.31]I, Siegward of Katarina.
[199:30.25]Where is it?
[199:31.93]He's hiding behind the bonfire.
[199:36.64]I think he's actually coming.
[199:39.04]No!
[199:41.90]You should have waited!
[199:45.08]Well, it's too late now.
[199:51.62]Hey.
[199:52.94]Too late.
[199:55.22]Hey, what do you say we kill this guy?
[199:58.82]Ah, this is another one of those Colin D face moments.
[200:01.50]Like, I'm not doing it.
[200:03.00]You can do it.
[200:06.62]In fact, this is probably the worst culprit of a Colin D scenario.
[200:11.86]What do you say we both just, like, shank him?
[200:18.28]I'm just, I'm going over here.
[200:20.50]Whatever you're doing is what you're doing.
[200:21.92]I'm not doing anything.
[200:22.96]I was just putting thoughts in your head.
[200:24.32]You're not going to get me to kill NPCs that I like in this game.
[200:29.43]I pretend that they're my friends and that we're doing an adventure together and I would not want to kill them or hurt them.
[200:36.19]Okay, well, that's really... Oh, fire meds!
[200:39.55]That's really messed up considering you told me to, like, activate the mimic earlier.
[200:45.23]I thought we were cool.
[200:46.93]The mimic is not an NPC.
[200:48.43]It is a monster.
[200:48.97]No, no, no.
[200:49.99]I'm talking about me.
[200:54.11]What?
[200:55.25]No, like you're adventuring with your friends and you won't kill them.
[200:57.37]That was me.
[201:01.07]Well, we're both capable fighters.
[201:03.85]I was under the assumption that you were a capable fighter.
[201:05.48]Alright, we can knock these down.
[201:09.28]That not understanding what I was saying right there is why you cannot be Bugs Bunny.
[201:15.73]Daffy Duck's... Daffy Duck's fucking cooler anyways.
[201:29.04]Hey.
[201:29.70]Hey, bro thinks he's Donald Duck as well.
[201:31.65]No.
[201:46.82]Ooh.
[201:50.44]It's a Bloodborne hat.
[201:57.32]Ooh.
[201:58.10]Ooh.
[201:58.83]Ooh.
[201:59.45]Ooh.
[201:59.69]Ooh.
[202:01.45]Oh, wait.
[202:01.95]Show me again.
[202:02.47]Show me.
[202:12.41]You think you have Bugs Bunny pulling that joke again?
[202:17.24]I only got one.
[202:18.06]No, that's a... That's like pork and pig territory.
[202:21.86]Bug Bunny every episode does the same joke.
[202:24.64]You're going to want to get this.
[202:27.30]Oh, it's me, Buggy.
[202:28.96]Whatever.
[202:29.54]You're going to want to get this item.
[202:32.18]You're going to be very excited about it.
[202:37.66]No, that's a comedy item that you like.
[202:39.56]I don't like that.
[202:42.02]Bro thinks he's Bugs Bunny and doesn't want the comp- No.
[202:44.28]Okay, you're like... You're not even a cartoon character.
[202:47.86]You're like, I don't know, you're like... Jesse from Breaking Bad.
[202:51.49]Is that supposed to be an insult?
[202:56.47]No, it's just you're not in that universe.
[202:58.37]You're not in the Looney Tunes universe.
[203:00.39]He's a beloved character.
[203:14.08]That makes you Walter White.
[203:18.42]Who I only just recently realized was not the hero.
[203:27.95]Item.
[203:34.03]That's a lot of these guys.
[203:38.96]the ground.
[203:41.96]Not every character is me.
[203:43.94]I don't know because this is like a bunch of mods and I feel like you like proning walking around.
[203:48.42]It's been I haven't played this game in a while.
[203:50.26]I thought that was you proning.
[203:52.47]I saw you do that and when you're playing Assassin's Creed you were like proning around.
[203:55.53]You must have been watching Assassin's Creed because that was my only joke.
[203:59.01]You were doing it a lot so I thought I was like oh he's doing the proning around thing.
[204:02.07]It's pretty funny.
[204:04.20]Nice.
[204:04.58]Holy smokes dude.
[204:09.72]Oh, Walter.
[204:10.76]I feel like I just saw a witness to greatness.
[204:15.50]Walter.
[204:18.36]You can't do that, Walter.
[204:20.40]That's a different character.
[204:22.86]No, I'm talking to you because you're Walter if I'm Jesse.
[204:26.60]I was doing some roleplay.
[204:27.92]I know, but Jesse is not Mike.
[204:30.88]Are we going this way?
[204:31.58]I think we could jump on this thing over this way.
[204:33.82]Yes, but we need to get the items first.
[204:36.20]Okay.
[204:37.40]Okay, we're good.
[204:41.75]No.
[204:43.55]Here we go.
[204:47.27]Oh, no.
[204:51.32]How did you miss that jump, by the way?
[204:53.14]I didn't.
[204:54.30]I did not miss that jump.
[204:57.24]Dude, the Uji Katana's here.
[205:00.52]And the reverse ring.
[205:01.38]The Uji board?
[205:02.20]You got an Uji board?
[205:02.96]Hey, if we did a Uji board together, you would deliberately try to scare me, and it would work.
[205:13.67]What question would you ask?
[205:16.33]I don't know.
[205:17.07]The dead.
[205:17.87]Are you in the room with us right now?
[205:24.20]How did you die?
[205:24.76]Hold on.
[205:29.14]I'm dying again.
[205:30.18]What's the afterlife like?
[205:31.19]This guy with the archer.
[205:34.24]I can just open the door for you, I think.
[205:37.24]Holy shit.
[205:42.77]I didn't realize I had no health.
[205:54.27]That Ouija board doesn't talk.
[205:56.17]It spells the words out one by one.
[205:59.82]Oh.
[206:01.72]Well, you're an expert.
[206:06.39]Oh no!
[206:08.09]What?
[206:10.93]I was mildly inconvenienced.
[206:12.93]And in this modern era of technology, I don't know how I'm gonna recover.
[206:16.39]I think I got everything.
[206:32.23]Wait, what is it?
[206:32.63]Oh, I can do different actions?
[206:34.81]Magic damage absorption.
[206:35.99]Why do I have two of these?
[206:37.16]Oh, that's a plus one.
[206:37.98]Let's do this for now.
[206:43.70]You should have a sleepover stream and tell ghost stories.
[206:52.04]Alright, so we got to go back to the pyromancy guy.
[206:56.10]I mean I did sleep over his house and he made me sleep in the basement which is weird because Vegas doesn't have those regularly but it did smell like uh charred like charred meat like burnt hair you're on this today so this is this is a part two I forget where I'm going I already got all the items I'm good
[207:36.35]um if you could live with a friendly ghost like you can say yes or no are you sharing your house with a friendly ghost um okay does the friendly ghost go and do can the friendly ghost have free reign of the whole apartment or house of course no uh the property lines completely
[207:59.91]Why not?
[208:01.09]I would say that if the ghost was allowed... Because I don't want the ghost to be able to go into the bathrooms.
[208:05.83]That's my space.
[208:13.66]Mm-mm.
[208:15.06]That seems kind of, uh... My... The bedroom?
[208:20.52]There's a platform here.
[208:24.06]I don't want a ghost to just sit there like this.
[208:27.23]While I'm sleeping.
[208:28.11]Get the fuck out of here.
[208:30.74]Why would you do that and why are you doing that?
[208:32.04]But it's like, friendly.
[208:32.76]Its intentions are always good.
[208:34.76]I don't- why are you- why do you need to watch me sleep?
[208:35.98]So even if it's watching you in the bathroom?
[208:37.98]Why do you need to watch me sleep or watch me in the bathroom?
[208:40.36]Get the fuck out of here.
[208:41.30]Friendly ghost?
[208:42.08]Fuck you.
[208:43.14]No, what?
[208:45.14]Are you that insecure?
[208:46.92]I don't- I- I- If a ghost could not accept the terms of, I don't want you to be in my bedroom when I'm in my bedroom, then I am getting- I'll be like, alright buddy, stay right there.
[208:57.20]I'm coming back with an exorcist.
[208:59.29]Bro, what are you hiding?
[209:01.60]I just won't- I want to sleep in peace!
[209:04.28]I don't want to- You don't feel any sympathy because it can never sleep, and it is always waking.
[209:12.16]It is woke.
[209:13.96]It's just- just staring.
[209:16.30]I don't want anything to look at me.
[209:18.61]It's- What if it speaks Spanish?
[209:22.17]I don't care what language or- I ran this whole way and this just goes in a circle?!
[209:26.35]Did you pick up all the items?
[209:29.01]There was nothing.
[209:31.37]I don't care what language the ghost speaks.
[209:33.79]Come, come, come, come.
[209:36.43]Come, some say, come.
[209:38.65]Let's go.
[209:39.33]We got to go down the elevator.
[209:41.19]Hold on, there's an item.
[209:47.31]Oh, fire bomb times three.
[209:49.01]I need to go back and do my pyromancy.
[209:53.95]And you're not listening to me.
[209:55.21]Okay, okay, okay.
[209:56.39]Let's rest it.
[209:57.37]No, no, we're going ahead.
[209:58.43]We're going ahead because we're going to kill like one enemy.
[210:01.51]Yeah, just like we were going to go back.
[210:05.23]Like we were going to go back there before, huh?
[210:08.80]We're getting increasingly hostile.
[210:15.12]I'd really like to take a step back if we could.
[210:21.86]They're laughing at us because they say we're still in this area.
[210:23.94]Who cares?
[210:25.32]We're just... We're co-oping it up.
[210:33.90]Why did your mods just say don't repeat what Ster says?
[210:36.60]I hope I made it.
[210:39.88]Because Ster would be a ban chatter in my chat if he was a chatter.
[210:44.65]Okay.
[210:45.63]So then do I need to take a step back?
[210:48.45]No.
[210:53.33]Mr. Laundry Game Crash Out.
[210:56.47]You might have to rewrite your rules.
[210:57.85]Oh, we got somebody big.
[211:01.37]Did he throw poop or was that a rock?
[211:03.83]I just killed this guy.
[211:05.02]He was on the roof.
[211:10.56]You handle this.
[211:13.76]I'm going to crash out over here.
[211:16.77]So, I mean, what the fuck, guys?
[211:18.09]What's going on?
[211:18.59]Does Quizno still exist?
[211:20.27]I mean, do they toast sandwiches anywhere?
[211:22.19]That's a crash out, apparently.
[211:25.31]Not what I'm referring to.
[211:29.74]I believe you specifically said that you drink peppermint tea so your breath doesn't smell like ass.
[211:38.32]That's absolutely not even close.
[211:41.67]I said that a bunch of people in chat probably smelled like ass.
[211:44.89]And that
[211:46.59]No, you didn't even watch it.
[211:47.67]You probably watched like a 10 second clip out of context.
[211:52.86]OK.
[211:54.64]Do you want to back to Firelink?
[211:57.22]I do.
[211:57.78]I need to upgrade.
[211:59.32]Let's link up.
[212:07.93]He crashed out of the human meat allegations.

[215:14.61]That's a pyromancy tome?
[215:17.97]Yeah, give pyromancy tome to him.
[215:19.79]Okay, well, if I was a ghost, would you let me be in your house?
[215:31.32]A friendly ghost?
[215:32.42]Yes, I'm like, yeah.
[215:34.52]Yeah.
[215:36.26]I don't believe you.
[215:37.08]If you need a place to stay, sure.
[215:38.96]Mm-hmm.
[215:44.01]See how easy that was?
[215:44.87]OK, what if it was OK?
[215:51.58]What if I temporarily gave you this place to stay?
[215:56.26]How long is temporary?
[215:57.18]6 months.
[215:59.85]6 months.
[216:00.37]What happens to my soul after that?
[216:02.45]You gotta figure it out.
[216:03.37]You gotta figure out what's going on in your life there.
[216:06.68]more than six months of that's what now we're talking about hey I kind of want a lit I mean well everybody everybody knows ghosts are either bound to houses or objects so so like am I a haunted object in your home because I can't leave your house if I'm haunting the house it's basically my house could I put you somewhere like okay you you try and kick me out at six months your cabinets are just gonna start opening dude
[216:36.17]try it I'll just hire like 30 priests I your toilet seat is up every time that's fine I I will I will I will hire like five priests to stay in the house 24 7. oh do you have like a garbage can that's like if it opens then Otto can get in it it's open I got priests staying in every room okay alright well it's kind of weird that you would want to live with like five priests rather than me
[217:12.25]Wait, okay, so the priests would stay there all night and all day.
[217:16.67]Yeah.
[217:17.18]Okay, but what if the priests have one room that they get to be in?
[217:19.82]Unless I need them.
[217:23.32]It's a big custom room.
[217:24.28]I guess you have to have a priest room.
[217:26.22]With their own custom bathroom.
[217:27.56]I don't care how expensive it would be.
[217:31.17]Custom everything.
[217:32.41]They could have a bunch of pinball machines, custom fucking...
[217:36.82]They got everything.
[217:38.12]Custom decals all over their rooms and stuff.
[217:40.96]And I get a salt circle.
[217:48.44]This does not sound good for me.
[217:52.30]Alright.
[217:52.70]I need one.
[217:54.12]Do you have any crunchies?
[217:57.14]You want my actual souls now?

[221:51.11]Delicious and Dungeness.
[221:54.65]I don't know the difference, honestly.
[221:57.58]I think snow crab.
[221:59.44]King crab is expensive, but I think king crab is the best.
[222:03.86]There was a lot of places in New Jersey that would do like all you can eat buffets down by the shore that would have like king crab.
[222:11.11]But I think I was a young lad and I didn't, I don't know.
[222:13.83]I was in like, I'm not allowed to eat anything other than french fries and chicken nuggets phase.
[222:18.49]Right.
[222:18.67]I understand.
[222:34.09]There's an NPC usually down here, right?
[222:37.05]Yes.
[222:39.93]Oh, that's why it's weird for you.
[222:41.18]You grew up like without a ghost in your house, right?
[222:45.98]Do you have a ghost in your house when you were younger?
[222:48.22]Yeah.
[222:52.44]It's kind of just, I guess it's like the culture difference.
[222:55.11]I forgot it's not normal to a lot of people.
[223:01.15]What did the ghost in your house have any superpowers or magical powers?
[223:05.89]Nope.
[223:07.59]Oh, I just watched.
[223:13.22]Those are actually pretty good, aren't they?
[223:16.70]Hammers.

[235:48.82]Watch out for the tree.
[236:06.90]Okay.
[236:08.80]I'm not happy about it.
[236:10.26]It can't move.
[236:10.92]Dude, you can go there, isn't that insane?
[236:24.57]I'm scared of it now.
[236:25.43]Alright, where the hell are you?
[236:29.97]This place, I fucking hate this place.
[236:32.31]I'm where the tree was.
[236:33.33]Oh, there you are.
[236:41.56]You were just going to watch it.
[236:43.80]You needed one hit.
[236:49.24]Is the claymation guy?
[236:52.21]Yeah, someone needs to add the texture to that monster.
[237:01.95]With pleasure.
[237:09.65]I just suck at the game.
[237:10.94]I just tried to do the funny thing that you were doing.
[237:13.18]It's in here, but we can go around if you want.
[237:18.52]This area is going to be very difficult, Gordon Freeman.
[237:21.40]This looks like a Chrono Trigger monster.
[237:36.21]Scale.
[237:41.65]See, I can do it too.
[237:44.61]Isn't there a Black Knight down here somewhere usually?
[237:47.11]Yeah.
[237:49.91]Uh, not here.
[237:53.83]But generally, yes.
[237:55.09]Oh, bounced.
[238:03.35]Place is crawling with them.
[238:06.72]Boss is up there in the room.
[238:10.55]We're going to get there with zero Estus.
[238:13.49]We can do it.
[238:16.16]Like I don't have any now and we still got to go through.
[238:20.68]Dog world.
[238:22.62]Got it.
[238:22.86]If you die, just run right back.
[238:29.56]It's to the left and just go straight.
[238:30.92]Actually, I think there's a bonfire up here.
[238:35.88]I think we have to kill the boss first.
[238:41.02]Maybe.
[238:42.28]Yeah, you're right.
[238:43.61]You know, I will say, when we did Elden Ring seamless co-op, you were floating around a lot of the time.
[238:50.39]It was hard.
[238:52.31]This has been almost perfect.
[238:56.97]I have not seen a single issue the whole time we've been doing this.
[239:00.54]Not one.
[239:01.94]I saw some slight weirdness, but for only a moment.
[239:06.98]It's been good.
[239:16.65]Is it weird that I want to do that?
[239:18.53]I want to like dip my head in like that wax.
[239:20.29]I feel like it would feel good.
[239:23.47]Um... That is a kink.
[239:29.88]I'm talking about for therapeutic reasons.
[239:36.17]You want to therapeutically pour hot wax on your head.
[239:39.89]No, like, why does it have to be burning hot?
[239:43.46]It just needs to be like warm and I don't know.
[239:49.42]You don't get it.
[239:49.90]I don't.
[239:52.18]You don't understand like the act of like pampering yourself.
[239:56.40]Pampering yourself.
[239:59.32]Yeah, can I get the full package and yeah, the burning hot wax as well?
[240:04.12]Oh yeah, I'll sign the waiver.
[240:05.68]Just don't get it.
[240:08.68]The release form.
[240:09.58]He just doesn't get it, and that's okay.
[240:16.19]I mean, you gotta go... It's up, right?
[240:20.19]Uh, it's back the other way.
[240:21.33]And I think we took a wrong turn.
[240:23.93]Yeah, it's right down this way.
[240:31.84]I'm quite injured.
[240:44.15]Are you coming?

[241:04.26]Bro, what?
[241:05.88]He killed me in one swing.
[241:07.86]In one hit.
[241:11.52]Did he hit me right in the square in the forehead?
[241:22.34]There's a bonfire down here somewhere that we didn't get as well.
[241:26.04]Like in the swampy zone, like right here.
[241:29.68]In the swampy zone.
[241:30.71]You have to travel a bit to get there.
[241:41.47]Well, I'm stuck in here now.
[241:42.69]I'm coming.
[241:44.07]Why don't you just die and then run to where we need to go?
[241:47.63]Uh, no.
[241:48.99]No?
[241:50.79]Alright, well, I'm at the boss.

[250:36.23]Guys, he doesn't even know the strategy.
[250:39.96]What's the strat?
[250:40.94]The strategy is you go outside and let the sun hit you in the face for 15 to 20, at least like 15 minutes.
[250:47.71]Just go out there and just let the sun hit you in the face for like 10 minutes.
[250:51.01]You should be doing that every day.
[250:52.49]The strategy is to leave your home?
[250:56.49]No, just open up a window or something where the sun is going and let it hit you in the face.
[250:59.97]No, I can't do that.
[251:02.75]Why not?
[251:04.76]I really like vampires.
[251:06.04]I know you're only a Dracula enjoyer, which I think is a shame.
[251:10.14]I think if you open your mind to it, you'd like other vampires.

[253:37.15]I think Fire would be cool, but I'm down for whatever.
[253:40.99]It's not like it matters.
[253:42.60]This is a randomized bullshit.
[253:44.14]We're going to find like two fire spells the whole game.

[255:19.32]I laughed at this in my playthrough.
[255:20.20]I went, he's backflipping.
[255:28.67]You can tag me in if you want.
[255:29.81]Okay.
[255:31.63]I'm waiting on the other side of the rope.
[255:33.97]Alright.

[256:47.13]You drank an Estus.
[256:48.13]That's BM.
[256:54.45]I'm going to be a wicked bad.
[256:55.95]I'm going to be a heel.

[257:46.68]Yeah, it sucks.
[257:47.28]It's so annoying when that happens.

[258:16.96]Yeah!
[258:18.10]Yeah!

[258:22.25]Everyone's cheering right now because he came and attacked you.
[258:26.95]You were at the ropes, he just ran off the ropes and pushed you when you fell down onto the mat.
[258:41.41]Time to drink some fucking sludge water.
[258:46.17]Sludge water?
[258:49.93]Ah.
[258:51.53]Well, we beat the game.
[258:56.08]Nice.

[260:03.59]But I do have to be home by supper.
[260:05.91]Wait, do you want to set some rules that we actually have to tag in and out?
[260:11.64]If you want to.
[260:12.60]I feel like that's fair.
[260:21.89]They're going to get harder.
[260:23.87]They are going to get harder.
[260:24.65]That's fine.
[260:25.87]Yeah.

[260:29.86]You want to go level?
[260:30.98]I got 34,000.
[260:31.28]I think it's a good idea.
[260:40.99]I really can't believe Dark Souls 3 did not have bonfire level ups.
[260:47.11]That's true.
[260:47.61]Well, I guess they kind of kept the... You need to do it with the... The lady has to grab your arm and... My best friend...
[261:00.65]I need a little bit more attunement.
[261:02.62]I need 20 and 20.
[261:09.28]So that'd be that.
[261:10.84]Okay, that gets me to 20 faith and then I need 20 intelligence.
[261:18.83]Let's roll the super fireball.
[261:34.87]Turn the floodlight off.
[261:36.69]It's the sun.
[261:37.53]It's the shining golden sun.
[261:41.05]Not turning it off.
[261:50.89]This thing is going to be disgusting now.
[261:55.57]Like filthy?
[261:56.27]Yeah.
[262:00.69]It's erasing your eyebrows.
[262:02.03]Well, whatever.
[262:02.51]You can like giggle about it.
[262:08.48]You having a laugh?
[262:10.62]Oh, we had another bone shard.
[262:11.74]We didn't burn it.
[262:14.52]Do we get any more?
[262:15.10]Estus shards are just bones.
[262:18.30]I don't recall any.
[262:21.23]Alright, let's go.
[262:25.37]Oh yeah, this zone?
[262:26.01]This zone sucks.
[262:28.41]No, it does.
[262:29.87]All in favor of just running to the end of this zone, say aye.
[262:33.25]Aye.
[262:35.38]I'm following your lead.
[262:36.88]You are my commanding officer.
[262:38.22]We're both in the same, like, military unit.
[262:40.64]We're both wearing the same uniforms.
[262:42.38]But you have the general's face.
[262:44.84]Okay, so we are running and lighting all the three fires and we're not fighting this person.
[262:49.90]We gotta kill this person.
[263:00.33]Oh, Zoe.
[263:01.96]wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what's the Harold you into that herb sword somebody is running up here is that dexterity oh that that area uh the maggot lair and in Diablo II you know what I'm talking about that area is gonna suck
[263:34.05]Yeah, this whole game is going to suck.
[263:37.84]No, that's not what I said.
[263:39.26]I'm not allowed to say Tim Hortons is bad.
[263:41.64]And you're like, yeah, the game, the whole game we're currently playing, this fucking sucks.
[263:46.92]Why not?
[263:49.90]He only spoke the truth.
[263:55.58]Watch out, bug.
[264:00.49]Dung pies.
[264:05.16]I think Dark Souls 3, the video game, is awesome.
[264:10.34]Do you remember when the Dark Souls 3 kind of first gameplay reveal and trailer were coming out and everyone was like, oh my god, it's going to be Bloodborne.
[264:16.45]It's the Bloodborne engine.
[264:18.51]It's going to be fast and quick.
[264:20.63]Yeah, it was great.
[264:24.45]I just don't love the levels.
[264:25.95]I don't like the areas of Dark Souls 3.
[264:29.79]And I've come to realize that.
[264:39.52]What, like level 1, level 2, level 3?
[264:41.00]Alright, do you think that all the FromSoftware games would be as beloved if it was level 1-1, then 1-2, then 1-3?
[264:49.12]If they would just- that's all it was.
[264:52.62]And that's what it's called.
[264:54.06]It's like, oh yeah, welcome to like level 1-5.
[264:55.44]And we start- we literally start right here and go forward from here.
[265:03.15]And then we beat it and we go to the- and it's like, oh you beat that 1-5, now you're in 1-6.
[265:09.74]Or do you think the openness of the world is what matters?
[265:13.64]The world isn't that open in this one.
[265:19.23]I think when Dark Souls 1 was new, the fact that it had an interconnecting world blew people's minds.
[265:28.17]Even Demon's Souls.
[265:30.77]We're running through this whole thing in a minute.
[265:40.72]I, dude, I don't care if the Massamoon is in this, uh, this zone.
[265:43.92]Oh, that's the shard.
[265:45.36]No, wait, come back, come back.
[265:46.88]There's, isn't there like a bonfire in this room?
[265:52.04]I thought.
[265:53.85]Uh, there is, through here he is.
[265:57.79]The Massamoon?
[265:59.45]Oh, my neck.
[266:00.63]Okay.
[266:00.73]We got a little, we got a joker here.
[266:06.69]Oh.
[266:14.76]The DLC guy.
[266:15.58]Oh, he's down there sniffing toes.
[266:20.53]He's got our son.
[266:22.55]You don't know.
[266:23.79]Is that what it?
[266:24.23]Wait, is this what his face looks like?
[266:26.23]Talk to him again.
[266:26.93]So that's what his face looks like, huh?
[266:35.60]Crazy.
[266:37.42]Wow.
[266:40.06]I wait, I accept.
[266:40.94]Wait, why is it you?
[266:43.34]Why does he be now?
[266:51.99]I don't even know what I agreed to.
[266:53.15]He took us to the DLC.
[266:54.57]Oh.
[266:54.67]He's down there.
[266:57.61]Oh.
[267:08.76]Is it gonna be you that takes it?
[267:11.52]No, it's him taking it from... I just hurt my chest.
[267:15.91]No, that's the same shirt that I was wearing.
[267:18.03]No, that's his beard.
[267:19.23]That's me.
[267:29.98]And then the ashes were too late.
[267:43.04]I did that last night and everybody freaked out and thought I was a lunatic.
[267:46.03]So, like, I hope they say the same thing about you.
[267:48.71]What, you laughed?
[267:50.11]I did, like, a laugh like that and people were like, oh my god, is he okay?
[267:53.21]What's wrong with him?
[267:53.89]What's fucking wrong with his head?
[267:55.36]Oh.
[268:02.84]Well, thanks a lot.
[268:03.72]You brought us to the DLC, the hardest place.
[268:07.21]I... did not remember that.
[268:14.27]I'm so... Sorry.
[268:18.03]I mean, we can leave, right?
[268:18.99]Yeah.
[268:23.54]Okay, then I'm traveling us back to the chapel.
[268:31.98]Be quick about it.
[268:37.70]You were the one asking me about Joker Labs.
[268:39.71]Like, you did this to yourself.
[268:41.69]You wanted it.
[268:44.49]I did.
[268:44.93]You gotta follow me.
[268:49.57]Sigward's in the well.
[268:51.41]Are we saving Sigward?
[268:56.46]Sigward is right here.
[268:57.48]Oh, I think he's dead.
[269:01.94]Never mind.
[269:03.60]Permission to run?
[269:04.12]Granted.
[269:05.36]Granted.
[269:10.30]You don't want to fight through the maggot lair hallways.
[269:14.06]It's going to be a ton of random shit that spawns there.
[269:16.02]It's not going to be the skeleton.
[269:22.02]Well, don't we take like a left turn and there was like an actual relevant boss item at some point?
[269:28.06]Maybe.
[269:29.40]Not up here, I don't think.
[269:31.08]Maybe.
[269:31.34]I don't know.
[269:33.26]Run.
[269:35.54]Ooh, wrappings.
[269:40.87]No, it wasn't like that.
[269:46.69]Help, I'm dead.
[269:50.35]This is I get the permanent bleed.
[269:54.13]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[269:57.35]Got you.
[269:57.82]I know I'm gonna die.
[270:01.74]I can't.
[270:02.16]You have to like you have to torch.
[270:05.62]Torch.
[270:06.90]I don't think we got a torch ever.
[270:08.68]No, we didn't.
[270:09.72]You're in trouble.
[270:12.85]Jerma, don't leave me here!
[270:16.75]The weak must be the strong, Wooperville.
[270:23.28]Broadsword.
[270:24.34]Talisman.
[270:32.36]Jerma, I'm gonna die!
[270:34.16]You're lagging my computer!
[270:37.60]Why are they all aggroed to you?
[270:40.59]They all are aggroed to you!
[270:42.34]Dude, my controller got unplugged!
[270:43.96]What's happened?
[270:44.52]My controller got unplugged!
[270:45.58]What the f- Ah, man...
[271:09.96]I can't believe you died before me.
[271:12.42]Because I got in there, I was fighting, I started fanning the flames.
[271:20.76]That's why you just gotta run, because then the entire zone aggro's and you just get killed.
[271:27.75]And you were too busy, like, smoking whatever of weed up there that got you, whatever happened to you.
[271:33.37]Okay, you're kind of projecting now.
[271:45.43]Why are you fighting?
[271:47.25]It's fun.
[271:47.75]I like this chest here.
[271:49.11]Oh, wow.
[271:53.05]A chest.
[271:55.80]Why did he die?
[271:59.56]I'm dead.
[272:05.48]Can we not run?
[272:06.50]Can we not run?
[272:07.40]This is a fun zone.
[272:09.64]This is not a fun zone.
[272:10.96]This zone sucks, kind of.
[272:16.47]bonfire rest no rest at the bonfire are you here I'm alive up here but rest so we can reset it okay I feel like I just saved your life and I regret it okay now you use their respawning to like cheese it
[272:46.18]Yeah, I don't see you here.
[272:47.18]I'm here.
[272:48.20]This is so many sound effects, dude.
[272:58.07]I don't even know what direction the sound's coming from.
[273:07.82]This is like the best place in the game and you want to run through it.
[273:32.53]Oh, look it!
[273:34.21]That's what you would say if I had died.
[273:37.12]Like a really weird way.
[273:38.20]Oh, yeah?
[273:43.67]Get rested.
[273:55.77]Why am I not hearing like a... What the f... Oh, you're down here.
[273:59.07]Yeah.
[274:01.49]Alright, we'll take it slow.
[274:02.71]Fine.
[274:04.95]Hold my hand.
[274:05.47]I go for the screeching thing.
[274:32.50]Nice.
[274:34.48]You do know, maybe I shouldn't say anything because you're so smart.
[274:41.70]Yeah.
[274:42.62]Everything here just respawns over and over again.
[274:45.02]Would you like to continue to go slow?
[274:51.79]Is it only going to be the skeletons?
[275:00.02]I'm going to sneeze like the random enemies aren't coded to what the fuck you're just not helping at all.
[275:09.89]I was going to sneeze.
[275:13.92]You know, it's a good strategy here is.
[275:15.30]Alright, well, I'm stuck behind you.
[275:44.63]He wasn't even here to see it.
[275:45.97]Where are you?
[275:46.63]I went the correct way.
[275:50.49]I'm at the bridge.
[275:55.38]Ooh, shiny.
[276:00.68]I made it.
[276:01.12]Ooh, don't mind if I do.
[276:12.14]What, he called me a magpie?
[276:13.30]Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[276:40.23]You've only died 12 times.
[276:41.59]Relax.
[276:43.19]You too.
[276:43.69]Come with me.
[276:45.81]Follow my lead.

[277:19.59]That is a rat, hun.
[277:21.47]Babe.
[277:31.89]Oh, my God.
[277:32.89]I'm trapped.
[277:35.24]I'm actually trapped in the wall.
[277:36.54]I'm dead.
[277:40.74]It's pissing everywhere.
[277:41.78]What?
[277:44.60]What?
[277:45.89]What?
[277:49.61]Now you have to run through all that shit again.
[278:04.08]Oh, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
[278:08.68]You just... What are you thinking?
[278:10.30]Why are you resting and respawning everything?
[278:13.78]I didn't rest.
[278:15.61]The shit is respawning.
[278:16.99]I told you we should have just ran.
[278:20.89]We did.
[278:21.37]I took you up the cliff you didn't know about.
[278:24.03]You were going normal way.
[278:30.54]Did you die?
[278:31.72]No, I went to the left.
[278:34.10]I'm over the big door.
[278:37.30]I made it all the way.
[278:43.02]There's a lot of bullshit over here.
[278:44.55]Be careful.
[278:50.95]Wait, where the fuck are you?
[278:52.27]What?
[278:52.69]I'm up here.

[279:01.99]Watch out for the viking!
[279:02.71]Yeah, we got nothing up there.
[279:05.45]We gotta go across the other way.

[281:08.90]Hold on.
[281:15.50]I don't it's not even there on my screen.

[281:34.29]Is that this thing?
[281:35.81]Jagger's up to knock.
[281:38.17]This thing.
[281:38.59]You don't want this thing?
[281:40.83]The thing that goes... Oh, no.
[281:47.24]I'm kind of using the thing.
[281:49.60]The side panel.
[281:51.02]Okay.
[281:51.30]I'm good with this.
[281:51.84]Put a lot of upgrades in it.
[281:56.04]I could drop it on the ground too.
[282:14.69]If you could do pyromancies in real life, do you think you'd be doing, like, barbecues more often?
[282:18.45]Um... It'd be actually kind of cool just to not have to worry about... Oh, you could make that job.
[282:25.40]But you'd still have to have a pan, wouldn't you?
[282:29.54]But you couldn't just, like, cook meat in front of you.
[282:31.46]It'd be... It'd mess... It'd make your house just dirty and shit.
[282:38.40]You couldn't just put it on the counter and just, like, go... You would need to use a pan still.
[282:44.65]yeah this guy came down on a web what about you'd be too scared to lose control yeah what how hard is it to control hiking I'm almost dead too hard to lose control well how hard is it to control the fire is it one setting
[283:16.39]is it like or can I make it like a little like a lighter you have like a uh an oven adjuster knob on your elbow okay that's kind of cool somebody's falling again I mean like at parties when you want to show off your cool pyromancies like oh no I'll cook I think it'd be cool
[283:42.95]Still have to worry about all that comes with it.
[283:46.00]Don't get grabbed by the tree.
[283:47.16]Didn't get grabbed.
[284:02.61]Cookie bug.
[284:06.55]Would you need a firebender to teach you?
[284:08.21]I think you just would be born with this, right?
[284:18.42]I don't think this is going anywhere.
[284:22.36]No, I don't think so either.
[284:23.38]I think this is a dead conversation.
[284:26.36]Yeah.
[284:28.42]I'm sorry.
[284:29.00]There's just like 700 enemies in this zone.
[284:51.78]I was there.
[284:54.14]We did it.
[284:55.83]We do it.
[284:59.21]Nobody ever locks the back door.
[285:02.41]Help.
[285:04.03]And there's always a chain link fence.
[285:08.05]That you can walk in somewhere around the like on the side.
[285:12.57]Oh, this actually this place actually sucks.
[285:15.05]It does, it does.
[285:17.62]Not wrong.
[285:26.92]This place actually feels not that bad because it leads to a place that sucks more.
[285:31.68]Also true.
[285:33.98]Got you.
[285:34.54]Oh, that's nasty.
[285:37.50]Nasty.
[285:38.14]What's that in the game?
[285:40.32]That's fucking nasty.
[285:43.82]There's like pukes on you or something.
[285:45.34]There's like vomit in the game.
[285:46.88]That's actually fucking nasty.
[286:03.84]I'm not alright with that.
[286:06.63]When do we get bonfire?
[286:09.95]Never.
[286:10.73]We get an elevator.
[286:11.97]There's usually a giant guy right here, but he's not here.
[286:16.04]It's like a weird dog.
[286:20.59]That's a pretty big dog.
[286:21.63]Do we go up the elevator?
[286:22.61]I forget where that goes.
[286:24.20]This is where the deacons?

[286:31.50]Are the deacons going to be 17 bosses?
[286:35.76]Oh, my God.
[286:36.24]It actually might be.
[286:42.19]What if it's seven?
[286:42.95]What if it's like 70 Medeiros?
[286:46.46]what if it's like 70 of your best friends and it's a surprise party and there's streamers coming down from the ceiling when we walk in and they're all happy to see you oh and then you start noticing people that you haven't seen in a long time and you realize wait a second I might be dead and you're dead and and you're in you're in hell are you implying that all this all streamers are going to hell why wouldn't they are you going to hell

[295:23.19]Isn't it right there?
[295:25.63]No, I think we have to go across all of the goo.
[295:28.69]No, this is on the other side here.
[295:30.83]There's like seven guys chasing you.
[295:32.75]You're very popular right now.
[295:35.27]It was right there.
[295:40.98]Oh, they're right there.
[295:46.58]Yeah, down the stairs in the back.
[295:48.36]Bro, are we stupid?
[295:50.28]Yeah, down the stairs in the back is the deacons.
[295:52.94]No, but there's an elevator here to go back to the bonfire.
[295:57.52]Isn't there?
[295:58.84]I don't know.
[296:02.34]This place is wiped clean of my memory.
[296:06.24]Yeah, no.
[296:07.10]There definitely is.
[296:09.77]Fucking kill this thing.
[296:12.21]Okay, done.
[296:13.79]There's no elevator?
[296:14.53]The elevator's later.
[296:16.49]I swear there's an elevator right here.
[296:27.34]Meow, meow, meow.
[296:29.70]Meow, meow, meow.
[296:30.24]Other side.
[296:30.72]Meow, meow, meow.

[297:09.90]And now Sigward is in the well.
[297:15.92]We're going back?
[297:16.50]I mean, we can.
[297:18.58]We can do this too.
[297:19.92]There's a drop down here.
[297:24.80]I don't like this area.
[297:25.82]Okay, you kick this ladder down.
[297:33.68]And then...
[297:39.27]is now here.
[297:40.93]I just might.
[297:42.39]OK, that's a little too far.
[297:47.19]Guard my souls, dude.
[297:48.01]I need those.
[297:49.49]I'm going to pick him up for myself.
[297:52.71]OK, so now that brings you back to.
[297:55.03]Around here, right?
[298:00.36]I'm where are you?
[298:04.20]Like across the river, but still not really like over here, isn't it?
[298:10.40]I don't know where you're trying to take us.
[298:11.72]This is not really connected.
[298:14.12]I'm right here.
[298:17.46]And then the river's here and then I go up.
[298:21.89]Yeah.
[298:22.31]Oh, okay.
[298:28.67]Nice work.
[298:31.43]This doesn't really seem like a shortcut.
[298:33.01]Where are my souls?
[298:35.58]uh you wouldn't think so but it kind of is because then we don't have to run through all the bullshit otherwise we have to run through all the bullshit I don't I guess I don't remember this because I've never died to deacon that's true maybe you have I don't know I was eating a sandwich one time I heard I heard you died to bone wheel um yeah the bone wheels in the zoo are awful
[299:06.43]Pinwheel, Pinwheel, sorry.
[299:09.19]You haven't even seen Pinwheel.
[299:10.55]You don't even know what that character is.
[299:11.67]Yeah, this is my first Soulslike.
[299:19.35]And then get in here and here we are.
[299:21.21]Alright, when we zone in, do both of our games crash?
[299:35.73]Good question, I guess.
[299:37.47]Because it might be 50.
[299:38.95]I don't know, whatever it is.
[299:40.99]Are we tag teaming?
[299:42.15]Who's first?
[299:43.35]I think we need to see what's in here because this could be a disaster.
[299:47.04]Alright, you first.
[299:53.10]Here we go.
[299:58.26]It's one Dragonslayer, Armor of the Deep, and he has 50% HP.
[300:06.41]He's not having a good time.
[300:08.41]Wait, don't do anything.
[300:10.49]You want to tag in?
[300:11.03]I got him.
[300:11.47]Nah, you got this.
[300:18.40]You want to get him?
[300:18.90]He's showing full HP for me.
[300:20.10]Alright, so you tell me how much health he has when I do this.
[300:25.00]Yeah, it's full HP.
[300:25.87]Okay, this guy actually... He's dropping down.
[300:34.23]Oh, boy.
[300:34.95]That's a tag.
[300:35.87]That's a tag.
[300:36.69]Yeah, it's tagging.
[300:38.49]No, no, no.
[300:38.81]I have to do it.
[300:39.25]I have to physically do it.
[300:39.99]Tagging.
[300:43.38]Okay, tag.
[300:44.00]Nice.
[300:57.59]Nice.
[301:08.75]I only have three heals you got it I don't know about that I remember this enemy having like a really annoying phase two will he go into phase two should because he flies away in phase two
[301:39.95]He's really hard to fight with a great sword.
[301:43.59]He has a lot of health.
[301:52.36]I love how we're watching a memory that we had or something.
[301:57.42]I'm reminiscing of the time that you did this.
[302:04.46]So you need to do it, otherwise this memory is going to be fucked.
[302:11.78]If I attack him, I can't recover before he can shield bomb me.
[302:17.83]With this weapon.
[302:21.79]I think I would have beat him.
[302:22.53]I just only had three flasks out of six.
[302:24.45]I think we can co-op this guy.
[302:28.57]No, tag team.
[302:29.67]You want to still do it?
[302:30.31]Alright.
[302:32.47]I mean, I kind of want to give him the run.
[302:35.24]I kind of want to get the run back, Morty.
[302:39.08]Does that mean I have to do...
[302:41.36]No.
[302:42.46]I can't.
[302:43.32]That's, like, people hate that shit.
[302:46.16]Wait, wait.
[302:46.70]Okay, I was about to do it.
[302:48.02]I looked over and it was just... People are just wild.
[302:51.49]I always started just doing a funny voice because I always do voices.
[302:56.19]And then it just went that way.
[302:57.39]I got a break coming up in two minutes.
[303:02.23]Do you think you can beat this guy in two minutes?
[303:06.68]Two minutes.
[303:07.72]I can beat you in two minutes.
[303:11.59]Uh, who is that?
[303:12.15]That guy from Venture Brothers?
[303:21.96]Oh, Dr. Girlfriend!
[303:22.90]That guy?
[303:26.88]I saw a first-time chatter in your chat get it correctly, and by, uh... Okay.
[303:38.82]I was trying to do like a huge dropping attack and have you laugh because I would die but still hurt him I didn't even see I was outside yeah adventure brothers no that's fang from Street Fighter wait
[304:08.82]we're not gonna be able to find any of his stuff ow what uh is it where it's in there there's no way this is a shortcut oh why not it's safer I don't know I already lost an Estus coming up here
[304:35.82]well uh we're gonna have to see what happens when we're back after the commercial break will Ster be able to win will Ster be able to beat the Dragonslayer of the deep or will we lose and have to start over again that's coming up very soon I'm going to crush him between my thighs until he begs me to stop
[305:05.92]Alright, I'll be right back.
[305:07.74]I have to go to a safe place.
[305:10.06]I'm sorry, did that make you think of thighs and now you have to go eat one?
[305:13.80]No, I just did the ads are going to play right now.
[305:16.72]OK, sure, we'll get to a spot where I can actually why am I like like we're not doing anything right now.
[305:23.23]I want to get up though.
[305:25.58]You're going the wrong way.
[305:26.24]The elevator is the other way.
[305:27.74]Can I get up?
[305:28.46]Are you getting up in a minute anyways?
[305:30.64]Getting up?
[305:31.90]Are you... You got a break coming?
[305:35.02]I turned mine on because you said yours was happening.
[305:37.46]Oh, okay.
[305:37.78]So you're going... Okay.
[305:39.78]Let's just get in front of the door.
[305:41.08]I'm following the lead and you're the leader.
[305:43.44]So let's get in front of the door and then I'm going to get up and get another drink.
[305:47.84]No, why am I saying that?
[305:48.90]I have a drink right here.
[305:51.72]Another vial of blood.
[305:54.12]I will move my legs up and down.
[305:57.65]They're going to chase us down there.
[305:59.59]We'll just kill them.
[306:02.36]Want to do squats?
[306:04.66]I usually do that when I get up.
[306:07.16]Alright, hold on.
[306:15.82]OK.
[306:17.94]Sorry, sorry, my knees hurt when I do it.
[306:21.73]Where are the ads?
[306:30.88]Stop it!
[306:31.20]Stop it!
[306:32.51]What?
[306:32.71]They're running?
[306:37.93]They just played?
[306:39.17]No, they didn't.
[306:39.99]They definitely didn't.
[306:44.17]It said they were about to start.
[306:45.11]It says pre-rolls are only off for one more minute.
[306:49.57]Wait, what?
[306:57.05]It says in progress.
[306:59.05]Wait, what?
[307:00.49]How come I can't... This is weird.
[307:04.17]For me, on my dashboard, it says that they're not running and pre-rolls are off for one more minute.
[307:11.67]We gave all the ads to one guy.
[307:14.19]What the fuck?
[307:15.66]He's watching six hours.
[307:21.16]That's very strange.
[307:27.44]So what is my dashboard going to do now?
[307:34.96]Refresh the dashboard.
[307:43.04]Sorry, I'm quacking.
[307:45.00]Okay, it does say they're off.
[307:46.24]Yeah, that was weird.
[307:46.92]It didn't even say they were starting.
[307:49.27]Oh, well, what the hell?
[307:53.73]Okay, well, I guess they happened already.
[307:59.33]Oh, well, I didn't even get to get up!
[308:03.41]Alright, let me get up.
[308:04.09]Let me just take one minute.
[308:05.75]I do, I want to get up.
[308:09.42]I'll be right back.
[308:11.10]Okay, I'll just be hanging out here by the door waiting to fight my mortal adversary.
[308:17.82]Yeah!
[308:19.56]I'm gonna take him down!
[308:32.52]Soon.
[308:35.23]And then we play credits, and we get the after credits, like, on the next episode.
[308:39.69]Jerma Ster, Dark Souls 3.
[308:41.25]Yeah, I'm fighting them, yeah!
[308:45.45]And they make it, you know.
[308:46.39]I'm unmuted for him.
[308:48.01]There's a lot of shows you can really watch by just watching the opening, like, skip intro.
[308:53.60]Hey, what up?
[308:54.82]Hey, I just gotta tell you, I gotta take care of Otto.
[308:57.40]I'm gonna be, like, two minutes.
[308:59.40]Okay, so, alright.
[309:01.60]So let's, I guess, run another 15 minutes of ads.
[309:04.68]No, I'm not running anymore.
[309:05.88]I'll be back in two minutes.
[309:11.77]Wish I was auto.
[309:14.83]But like ghost auto.
[309:23.96]Why is Ster so awkward?
[309:26.06]I don't think I'm being awkward.
[309:34.35]I think that's on you.
[309:35.41]I think that's on how you're receiving it.
[309:37.49]I feel very confident and comfortable.
[309:45.56]The cringe is on the receiving end.
[309:56.82]I think you're very normal and well adjusted.
[309:58.80]Thank you.
[310:01.36]I think that's going a little too far, but...
[310:06.25]Thanks.
[310:34.36]I mean, we're all in the same boat.
[310:35.82]We're all just kind of waiting for Jerma.
[310:39.24]Like, when's... Shut the fuck up.
[310:41.36]Like, when's Jerma going to show up?
[310:42.84]I just want to fight this boss.
[310:48.72]I don't know what else to do.
[310:51.64]My life is put on hold right now.
[310:53.70]Like, if he never comes back, I'm probably not leaving this spot.
[311:04.08]I gotta take care of the dog.
[311:08.88]I would have done it.
[311:09.84]The break didn't say there was a break going.
[311:13.69]I would have done it during the break.
[311:16.05]Alright, are you ready to fight the dragon?
[311:20.99]Yes.
[311:22.55]But I have to sharpen my blade.
[311:25.43]I have to pray to the god.
[311:35.18]Are you tagging it first?
[311:36.91]Yeah.
[311:41.29]Nice.
[311:44.47]I did not know what that was.
[311:55.81]He's too quick with the shield.
[311:57.33]Do not tag.
[311:58.61]Do not tag.
[311:59.71]What are you doing?
[312:01.19]I was just making it harder.
[312:06.35]Do not tag!
[312:07.77]Do not tag!
[312:16.64]He's too fast!
[312:21.63]Ah man, can you tag me in?
[312:22.55]Can you tag me in if you need to?
[312:40.07]My turn!
[312:42.06]My turn, you big freak!
[313:10.54]Nice try.
[313:12.54]I have like fucking 12 faith.
[313:14.59]I mean, I can't.
[313:15.33]I can't hurt this guy.
[313:21.29]I'm going to be a late game scaler by the way.
[313:24.07]OK.
[313:29.02]If you say so.
[313:31.68]I'm sorry I goofed.
[313:32.72]He's he's got two more got moves.
[313:37.99]Was unaware.
[313:41.17]I could have done it.
[313:41.97]I just did this stupid fan move and it takes a full two seconds to do it.
[313:47.69]I should have just used this thing that I've been using the whole time and I was doing perfectly fine.
[313:51.65]I don't know why I was doing that.
[313:54.51]Um, hello?
[313:55.03]What the fuck's going on?
[313:57.13]You can't climb because we were in each other.
[313:58.89]You need help?
[314:03.51]I guess I'll fight the knight.
[314:04.95]I guess I'll fight him.
[314:05.97]Bring him over here.
[314:11.24]I'm gonna die.
[314:16.86]I got him.
[314:17.36]I got him.
[314:19.17]I got an opening.
[314:19.81]I got an opening.
[314:20.41]Thank you.
[314:20.79]Thank you.
[314:21.13]Only died 15 times.
[314:29.21]It seems low.
[314:33.55]Seems pretty high.
[314:39.32]Like personally, real life, I've not died once.
[314:45.78]Group.
[314:47.70]On my first save.
[314:48.60]This is like a four mile run back.
[315:05.53]This run at this area sucks.
[315:12.99]Did you not come?
[315:13.73]Okay.
[315:14.64]I took a sip out of my drink.
[315:19.62]Why can't you just wait until you get to watch fight night?
[315:21.66]Do you think you're going to beat him right now?
[315:25.24]Are you confident?
[315:27.22]Uh, no, but I'll try.
[315:29.06]We could just co-op him.
[315:31.28]No.
[315:33.11]Okay.
[315:40.17]I'm putting on lightning resistance too.
[315:41.63]What are we doing?
[315:42.21]I need mitigation, lightning resistance.
[315:49.39]Did we have the lightning resistance ring?
[315:51.14]It's just too bad that there's not 50 of this guy in here.
[315:57.22]Yeah, lightning.
[315:57.98]Yeah, we got some lightning resistance.
[316:12.47]Alright, nice start.
[316:15.39]313, damn.
[316:37.87]481 holy shit.
[316:39.29]You're doing so much.
[316:39.83]You're doing tons of damage when I get the time to attack Oh shit, he had a he had a part two
[317:06.12]I'm just making sure that I keep the timing.
[317:07.62]Tag in.
[317:11.75]He does not want to tag in.
[317:22.17]You got this.
[317:23.67]We got this.
[317:24.33]Do something.
[317:26.65]It took so long.
[317:30.86]Do something faster.
[317:31.98]No.
[317:32.38]Do something when I say to do something.
[317:41.90]Alright, good damage, wanna tag?
[317:42.84]Alright, that's all I needed you for, tag.
[317:49.48]No!
[318:06.62]No!
[318:09.38]Fine, you get the last hit.
[318:10.30]I'm tagging in.
[318:12.38]Alright, I tagged in.
[318:13.50]Go ahead.
[318:19.35]Get him!
[318:19.63]Get him!
[318:20.47]Get him!
[318:21.07]Get him!
[318:21.73]Get him!
[318:23.51]Nice.
[318:24.41]That was laggy.
[318:31.21]He dropped a shard.
[318:34.42]You upset?
[318:36.06]You mad, bro?
[318:39.33]Dude, are you- are you mad?
[318:48.33]Um, yeah, don't you like not even go anywhere after Deakins?
[318:51.05]Uh, Deakins is to get- Like we do need to walk to the other side of the poison?
[318:54.77]I think Deakins is to get the doll?
[318:56.67]Because the doll is how you get to... Where are we going to get the doll?
[319:05.56]I don't even remember a doll.
[319:07.50]You get the doll to cross into, um, Irithyll.
[319:12.36]With the frosty, spinny guys where Pontiff is.
[319:17.25]So where the hell are we going?
[319:18.17]Do we have to actually find it here somewhere?
[319:19.67]Oh, that sucks.
[319:22.61]We actually have to find the doll here.
[319:26.99]Wait.
[319:27.27]Oh, man.
[319:30.79]I thought that was going to be the doll.
[319:35.21]It's actually kind of cool.
[319:42.90]Oh yeah.
[319:44.16]Showing a little chest.
[319:45.38]You like that?
[319:50.24]He likes it.
[319:50.76]It's cool.
[319:52.09]I feel like this is the kind of outfit I would like want to wear this.
[319:54.79]Just like lounging around the house.
[319:58.24]with all the gems running down the side a bunch of emeralds and fancy and I gotta make sure to have like the the middle tight so I look nice and skinny my core set I have really bad news for you somebody just said that the doll could literally be anywhere before where we are right now it could be anywhere
[320:21.68]I don't even remember what we use it for.
[320:23.91]It's to get... We need it to progress the game.
[320:27.77]It could be in Farron.
[320:29.61]It could be in the swamp.
[320:30.83]It could be anywhere before this.
[320:33.19]I mean, I don't know.
[320:34.46]There's other stuff to do.
[320:35.32]We can do DLC and... That's true.
[320:38.18]Why am I... Computer's kind of freaking out.
[320:46.31]So yeah, let's go to the other side of the goo here.
[320:50.55]Might have to actually fight these.
[320:52.86]That's fine.
[320:56.44]Could it be in the DLC?
[320:57.44]I don't think so.
[320:59.42]I think it's like whatever area is technically before this.
[321:12.78]Dude, run out.
[321:26.10]Oh, he, he 360 no-scope me.
[321:28.82]Oh my God.
[321:32.57]I'm just like warming up his ass.
[321:33.95]I'm not even actually hurting him.
[321:40.23]Oh my God.
[321:55.31]I'm just letting this guy hit me
[322:00.31]I felt bad for him oh you want okay you wanted to make it so you're playing one of your friends in Street Fighter or in a fighting game and you are doing so well that you're discouraging them from even wanting to play so you end up laying back a little so you take a few hits and you're like oh dude nice and you lose a stock or you you lose one life or something just to just to make sure that they don't quit the game because you want to like keep playing with them
[322:30.06]okay fucking psychopath that's just normal gamer that's just normal bro behavior I'm sorry it just is uh isn't there the whole upper area here that's a covenant that has special items in a boss we gotta when we like walk across the bridge we gotta pull the lever and go up yeah it's down here I'm you I feel like you're my guide I do not remember a lot about this game there's I it's been a year or two but
[323:01.14]Oh, nice dude.
[323:08.86]How did they grab me?
[323:11.78]Arms.
[323:15.16]I know the how I just want to know the why.
[323:24.78]OK, uh, what is it over here?
[323:26.54]There's one here.
[323:29.97]If I pull this and you stand somewhere, can we just boost you up?
[323:35.59]I missed it.
[323:36.17]I didn't get on it in time.
[323:38.70]But yeah, it seems like we could cheat.
[323:40.16]Can't just cheat?
[323:42.54]Yeah, no, it's not.
[323:43.32]I mean, like, we're playing Portal 2 right now.
[323:46.08]Yeah, let's just cheat.
[323:54.24]And then you just go get everything and tell me if it's any good.
[324:00.33]uh going up this one does not look like it connects correctly this one patches pulls one
[324:24.68]and the previous one looks like it has the open doorway I don't know if we can lower the previous one I forget where you do it I know patches does it once there's one up there I don't remember yeah I I I'm stuck here forever oh let me see if I pull hold on there's one over here I think there's another one
[324:55.87]Is there a second one here?
[324:56.67]Can you fight the big spider?
[325:00.52]We can fight the big spider eventually.
[325:02.06]Help.
[325:03.78]It's near the big door.
[325:05.06]Shortcut.
[325:05.62]Hold on.
[325:05.84]I'll get you.
[325:06.18]Help.
[325:09.18]I got you.
[325:10.66]Help me.
[325:11.04]Alright.
[325:21.35]Let's kill the big thing.
[325:22.51]I think it's over here.
[325:28.96]I love goo.
[325:31.40]I love fighting monsters in their septic tanks.
[325:41.07]This thing is actually kind of awful.
[325:47.08]Fighting this in the goo is not good.
[325:51.69]Where does this enemy normally show up?
[325:54.65]Uh, in here.
[325:55.45]He's like, there's a secret little... Oh my god, dude.
[326:00.60]He falls from the ceiling and there's an item at the end of the hallway and he gets you.
[326:06.28]Spooky.
[326:08.62]You can turn around and look in the room and he's just sitting there upside down staring at you.
[326:12.02]It's terrifying.
[326:15.12]Okay, so where... Somebody said it's by the big door?
[326:16.74]That might be over there.
[326:24.53]Earth Seeker.
[326:30.80]Earthen Wrath.
[326:36.86]OK.
[326:55.52]OK.
[326:59.02]Oh buddy chaos.
[327:03.06]That's gonna be a good one.
[327:07.52]Great club.
[327:08.34]That's a great club.
[327:09.52]We like clubs.
[327:12.52]That's it.
[327:13.56]What is it?
[327:13.80]What is this dude?
[327:17.40]Direct multiple chaos fire pillars.
[327:20.07]This doesn't scale with anything.
[327:26.03]Wait, is this just a regular item?
[327:27.47]Am I melting into my chair?
[327:36.97]Actually... I should, like, put my feet up.
[327:44.82]Do it.
[327:47.42]This thing is... I think this thing's fucked up.
[327:52.60]Getting shorter.
[328:03.23]OK, wait, wait, might be over here.
[328:05.11]This looks like fun to roll around in that.
[328:07.03]I'm sorry it does.
[328:08.15]I think it might be this one.
[328:16.42]I think you're right.
[328:19.36]Maybe.
[328:22.70]See it.
[328:24.58]So wait, I wouldn't go down.
[328:25.50]I think you actually have to go down and around and you pull it down there somewhere.
[328:33.29]If we don't find it soon, I swear I'm going to pull my pants down.
[328:36.21]There's one right here, but that was the one that we had already done.
[328:41.54]Where is it?
[328:47.16]This is the room where the guy is, by the way.
[328:50.22]It's in the corner.
[328:50.74]The guy?
[328:51.08]Apparently it's in the corner.
[328:53.86]But you know the guy?
[328:54.63]The guy we just fought.
[329:04.15]I don't remember.
[329:07.15]The bridge is already up.
[329:11.75]I guess we could just go up there, but isn't there two of them?
[329:16.69]Oh, the guy.
[329:20.35]After the boss room go up.
[329:25.72]Kind of I forget I'm lost.
[329:31.17]You know, if you could just walk.
[329:32.51]I just don't want to walk through this.
[329:34.67]I want to run through this.
[329:38.42]It is already up.
[329:39.44]Oh, wait.
[329:41.10]It's already up.
[329:45.18]Yeah, but how do you get on to this first one?
[329:47.05]The other bridge's lever is by the big door.
[329:48.87]To get to Patches, go from the big door you open and there's another ledge to the right coming into the cathedral.
[330:10.46]I thought he just said no when they did the emote that has the not like this space.
[330:15.10]The other one.
[330:15.78]The other door.
[330:16.94]The other big one.
[330:17.70]Other big door.
[330:18.40]Big door.
[330:18.95]Second door.
[330:19.41]Second floor.
[330:21.29]Okay, let's go.
[330:22.07]There's like three of them for the record.
[330:24.55]No, not like this.

[332:56.31]There he is.
[332:56.69]Oh, you bastard.
[333:00.17]Look who the reasonably sane showed up.

[333:21.47]Oh shit, he dropped his Exalted Orb.
[333:22.81]We got Soul of the Dancer?
[333:29.53]He killed her already.
[333:31.05]Doesn't have the boss we don't have to worry about.
[333:32.57]Oh bro!
[333:34.03]Bro!
[333:34.15]Holy shit, we're getting so legit right now.
[333:37.59]Cast the spell!
[333:40.09]Oh, wait, um... Yeah?
[333:46.53]Okay, good.
[333:47.41]I'm so glad that this is up.
[333:48.93]Because he usually kicks you off and pulls it, doesn't he?
[333:54.33]Now we can give the armor to Sigurd.
[333:57.25]And this is where the Covenant shit is.
[333:58.53]There's also a bonfire up here.
[334:08.14]Alright, this is the confessional box.
[334:09.94]Go ahead.

[334:49.80]You said it was a confession booth!
[334:53.24]I- I- I told you an accident.
[334:55.24]I didn't confess anything to you.
[334:56.84]Hey.
[334:58.30]I think it's an accident too.
[335:00.04]Whoa!
[335:00.47]Should not have happened.
[335:01.43]Actually, holy shit.
[335:02.11]What the hell?
[335:02.39]Stay out of my dreams.

[336:13.23]Okay, thank you very much.
[336:31.04]Hello?
[336:44.17]This is my favorite.
[336:48.64]You finally get to see the feet again.
[336:50.18]This is my favorite.
[336:54.00]Are you pledging fealty?
[336:55.88]Should I?
[336:56.22]I don't think it's going to do anything for us.
[337:00.72]Might as well.
[337:02.30]Who else am I going to pledge fealty to?
[337:03.66]True.
[337:07.43]Please, please let me in on Spike Shield.
[337:10.93]That's kind of good.
[337:14.94]Oh, actually.
[337:15.84]Are you going to respec?
[337:19.32]I mean, I specced like a fucking weirdo.
[337:22.26]Well, you need a larval tier.
[337:24.54]Actually, we need tongues.
[337:27.90]I have one pale tongue.
[337:30.38]Do it.
[337:32.59]Okay, so I want to do... What do I actually want to do here?
[337:37.01]I don't know.
[337:37.43]I don't know you.
[337:39.33]Is it faith in, right?
[337:41.17]Faith in.
[337:41.55]I need 15 strength.
[337:45.14]20 and 20, right?
[337:48.68]Because now I can throw the fireball and then put the rest into faith?
[337:51.84]Or how should I scale?
[337:52.74]I don't even know how this scales.
[338:02.11]Some fucking attunement.
[338:03.65]That's true.
[338:09.01]15 endurance though?
[338:09.53]That's dog shit.
[338:18.13]Okay, I have plus five faith from the thing.
[338:21.08]15 attunement.
[338:26.04]20 vigor.
[338:26.52]Is that alright?
[338:29.14]Less int.
[338:29.60]I need the int to throw the fireball.
[338:32.14]Is this not your ideal woman?
[338:33.59]I'm busy.
[338:36.21]I'm busy.
[338:39.23]You always have full stamina anyways.
[338:40.65]Alright, 15 Endurance.
[338:43.93]18 Faith.
[338:46.67]20... 18 Faith.
[338:48.05]I think this is good.
[338:48.51]I'm locking it in.
[338:48.95]You can do 18.
[338:52.17]Okay, 18 Vigor.
[338:52.77]20 Faith.
[338:54.73]Let's go.
[338:55.07]15 to 2 Endurance.
[338:56.67]I'm ready.
[338:57.61]Bingo.
[339:01.16]Lock it in.
[339:05.33]But now I actually can throw the fireballs and be cool.
[339:10.99]Don't throw them at her.
[339:13.08]I just might.
[339:14.60]Are we traveling back home to use?
[339:17.20]I have like 50,000 souls.
[339:19.32]Yeah, we should.
[339:21.40]That's how many you get every time we like reset a zone.
[339:23.92]But it's a lot to me.
[339:34.84]OK.
[339:35.28]I need more.
[339:48.06]More stamina.
[339:52.66]Is it really endurance for stamina?
[339:59.59]Stamina is endurance.
[340:02.25]OK.
[340:06.52]I'm running out of stamina.
[340:07.74]Usually I always have like stamina rings early game in every souls.
[340:12.12]What do you how many points are in endurance for you right now?
[340:20.77]I don't know.
[340:21.73]You could also give her these ashes you found earlier.
[340:25.29]and I think we have one of the boss souls that we can look at what the boss items are yeah the dancer weapons which actually might be good for what me right now honestly I think they're faith or hint it wouldn't be the dancer weapons is what I'm saying oh it would be random wouldn't it yeah uh make sure you put your flasks in who do you talk to for the you just talk to the chair
[340:51.99]chair for the boss souls uh yeah chair guy he's sitting up there welcome home but you had to actually hand it like I don't know there's chair guy farewell ashen one oh I forgot a dude was sitting here I thought you actually talked to the chair
[341:27.13]Boy, we can't... Usually when you kill the tree boss, the cursed Greatwood, you get the item to be able to pawn this stuff.
[341:39.02]So we don't have it, so you may as well just break the thing and get the souls.
[341:42.84]What item is that?
[341:45.37]What the hell is it called?
[341:46.13]I don't remember.
[341:48.77]I just know you get it from there.
[341:52.93]The kiln.
[341:54.17]Transposing kiln.
[341:56.37]Man, these items are quite random.
[341:58.57]I'm just breaking it.
[341:59.30]Oh, buy a dagger from the lady.
[342:03.86]A dagger?
[342:05.30]Why?
[342:06.80]So you can get dash for when we're in the poison swamp.
[342:10.32]Oh, yuck.
[342:20.27]She sells an Estus Shard.
[342:21.49]I didn't even see it.
[342:23.96]Is she?
[342:24.26]Yeah, from the ashes we just gave.
[342:26.96]Oh, I'm poor because I keep giving you all my money.
[342:40.75]You gave me 4,000 souls.
[342:44.35]That's really not a big deal.
[342:54.04]You owe me.
[342:55.36]With interest.
[342:56.92]Fine.
[343:04.03]Can you please do the impression of skipping through Andre's dialog?
[343:07.55]Yeah, sure.
[343:09.17]That was good.
[343:09.73]That was good.
[343:10.45]I aimed, please.
[343:27.55]Oh, I forgot the end.
[343:28.35]It's... I forgot that part.
[343:31.58]You're right.
[343:32.12]I really screwed it up.
[343:36.64]That's good.
[343:39.62]We need to give the armor back to Sigward.
[343:44.10]Does he really need it?
[343:47.26]Nice thing to do.
[343:48.87]The right thing to do.
[343:51.17]Alright, do it.
[343:55.81]We need to travel there.
[343:58.49]You can't do that?
[344:01.53]Is it only the host that can do it or can I just pull you?
[344:04.47]Oh, wait, I have to do my Estes shards anyway.
[344:06.86]I'll wait.
[344:10.02]Wait.
[344:11.40]Who do you do?
[344:11.80]Where do you do that to her?
[344:12.70]Uh, Andre.
[344:16.24]Estes shards, is that Andre?
[344:19.64]Uh, can this guy do anything?
[344:23.75]He does everything.
[344:24.49]He can upgrade your items.
[344:25.45]He can do your shards.
[344:26.53]He can do everything.
[344:27.89]Man, what I wouldn't give to have an Andre around the house.
[344:30.71]OK.
[344:39.21]That's some good tea.
[344:45.68]Alright, so where we gotta go to the swamp place sucks.
[344:48.38]That's fine though.
[344:50.46]uh which which where are we going we need to go I believe it's back to the swamp and when we were going down I think we go down uh well we fought the two npcs I believe we go down and then that way I think that's can you teleport like I don't know what you're describing uh fair and keep I'm going
[345:16.67]Okay, now...

[345:42.48]We need to... Uh, that's a small man.
[345:44.86]That's a small man!
[345:47.60]I died, and I lost all the... Ah, the ember that I had.
[345:54.48]Wait!
[345:57.84]Does somebody have a ranged attack they can use?
[346:00.92]I'll do it.
[346:01.32]I'll do it.
[346:01.72]I have fire.
[346:04.36]Here, I'm going to stun him.
[346:09.50]Stunned.
[346:09.90]That's a tall dude.
[346:12.89]That is a tall guy.
[346:14.39]At what point in the game is this guy from?
[346:17.49]Why is he not on a basketball team?
[346:19.33]We need to sign him.
[346:22.21]Oh shit, I need mana.
[346:24.59]Nice.
[346:26.43]I forgot we're in poison.
[346:27.97]Alright, let's go.
[346:28.65]Yeah.
[346:28.87]Just skip this whole area.
[346:31.33]Let's go.
[346:33.17]Just embracing the poison.
[346:43.16]Unfortunately, the doll might be here somewhere.
[346:46.75]Also true.
[346:47.93]I can hear when my mods start a gamble and it makes me very uncomfortable.
[346:52.53]You can hear?
[346:53.41]It's like a sound effect that plays.
[346:56.10]And I don't know what it is, but I assume it's to my detriment.
[347:02.00]I got the first one up here.
[347:10.11]Oh, this place is going to suck with normal enemies.
[347:13.01]Mm-hmm.
[347:15.18]okay that's good this fire is out the next one is where is it you get a good angle up there are you with me no I went a completely different way it's alright so maybe I hate this area so much that I've like memorized exactly where to do this yeah no I might be at one of the other ones that you didn't do
[347:49.97]Next one.
[347:52.35]Third one might be actually right by you.
[347:55.59]And this is where I think I have the last one.
[347:57.43]OK, that's two.
[348:01.61]And are you at the last one?
[348:04.33]Oh no, I went to the one you did, I guess.
[348:06.99]The last one is pretty far in the back then.
[348:09.35]How did you get here that fast, dude?
[348:11.21]I just freaked out and started going.
[348:13.87]We got Sonic the Hedgehog over here.
[348:20.02]Crazy.
[348:20.62]Alright, you just look in the sky and you can see them.
[348:28.58]Yep, over there.
[348:29.08]Yep.
[348:29.74]Okay, follow me.
[348:32.81]I don't know where you are.
[348:34.71]Ouch.
[348:39.13]It's got a church spell.
[348:44.90]Oh, the healing church.
[348:46.96]Whatever it was.
[348:47.42]It's up here.
[348:50.40]What is it right there?
[348:54.96]There's a free soup over here if you want.
[348:57.44]Sorry, I'm like fighting enemies.

[350:08.98]I got stuck in the wall between the one singular skeleton that was out there and the dog.
[350:16.00]Let's go together because I thought it was going to take more damage.
[350:20.50]I jumped on its head and it did like 10%.
[350:23.46]Also, why are you accusing me of being a streamer while we're literally doing stream together?
[350:27.90]No, I'm saying that you just were like, oh, it's a big dog, I guess.
[350:35.24]React harder.
[350:36.60]React harder.

[355:29.88]Wait!
[355:30.48]Guys!
[355:31.62]I think we just found the biggest dog in Dark Souls.
[355:41.67]Oh.
[355:42.63]Flame of flames.
[355:43.89]Oh, 36 damage.
[355:44.85]You got him.
[355:45.21]You got this.
[355:48.62]He's so fast.
[355:49.90]Guys!
[355:50.24]Guys!
[355:56.46]He's got ice moves!
[355:58.68]Oh, let's call him Icy!
[356:03.70]Big Icy!
[356:13.92]Damage him!
[356:15.04]I can't do this anymore, by the way.
[356:19.52]After this video, I can't fucking do this shit anymore.
[356:22.42]I'm so sick and fucking tired of having to do this.
[356:24.32]You breaking up the group?
[356:25.86]No, I just like... I don't know, man.
[356:28.81]It's been a while.
[356:29.43]I feel like I'm not gonna be able to fucking do it anymore.
[356:33.46]Like, we're trying so hard to get this shit to fucking happen.
[356:35.76]The icy dog is probably the only thing I've recorded so far that was, like, any good.
[356:42.56]You're gonna have your existential crisis later.
[356:45.18]We've been playing for six hours, dude, and the icy dog is the only thing that I get out of this.
[356:49.89]So how am I gonna make anything out of this?
[356:56.63]I mean, are you happy with what we just did?
[356:58.71]Jerma, I think this bit is relatable to, like, only the two of us.
[357:04.06]Like, I'm here for the bit, I just don't think it has a wide net.
[357:16.94]Like, we had this conversation and then I made the what really happened TF2 video.
[357:28.77]That actually did happen.
[357:38.22]oh okay I'm good oh I'm pulling out real shit yeah that's that's this is too real can we just play the game yeah let's beat this boss he loves doing this bit it's probably the third time I've seen him do this
[358:02.06]what you guys don't like the the existential like YouTuber trying too hard joke alright where are you are you good are we gonna go next to you I'm I'm good I'm about to be finished stinking I'm I'm good oh
[358:25.53]I do that, like, at least once a year.
[358:28.26]At least, like, a few times every, like, few months.
[358:31.56]Ugh.
[358:33.80]You get to think it's not a joke.
[358:36.42]Did you get the saint bidet?
[358:39.24]The bidet?
[358:39.70]Yeah.
[358:41.20]What even is it?
[358:42.50]Ugh.
[358:43.40]My fucking neck hurts.
[358:44.80]Don't fall.
[358:45.20]We're going up.
[358:52.76]I have no flasks, by the way.
[358:56.04]If he laughs like this again, that's when it's going to be the bed instead of the couch.
[359:00.29]If we could all just chill.
[359:01.75]Dog.
[359:02.31]Are we just opening the door and going in?
[359:08.91]No, no, no.
[359:10.37]There's a bonfire right back here.
[359:12.17]Oh, that's right.
[359:12.98]I'm poisoned again.
[359:18.74]I can't believe though, like honestly, we've been playing for how many hours and it's all we have is big dog.
[359:26.19]I mean, I've been having fun.
[359:27.21]I've been having a great time actually.
[359:40.62]Hospital bed stream.
[359:47.21]Just wait a few years.
[359:49.01]What if we see a bigger dog than that?
[359:51.03]That'd be crazy.
[359:53.85]We might.
[359:55.65]I think there's some like good items back this way too.
[359:58.15]Like I think maybe even key items because there's the one crystal lizard that's normally here.
[360:07.51]I can't even attack.
[360:08.35]You just get a kill before I can even throw my firebombs.
[360:15.45]sorry pal the ad break uh coming up thing just scared me that's a big dog dude you see how huge this dog is oh look at this no way it's that big oh praise the big dog praise huge dog praise big dog oh praise dog
[360:45.52]Dude, see if you can pet him.
[360:48.62]I'm petting the dog.
[360:56.01]Yeah, I don't think I'm using that.
[361:06.68]None of this is fucking usable.
[361:16.72]A lucerne.
[361:26.91]Yeah, there's usually a Black Knight down here and a crystal lizard and a big scary guy.
[361:33.94]Ooh, isn't that the, like, spell sword?
[361:36.10]Or am I thinking Elden Ring?
[361:37.92]I think you're actually right.
[361:39.88]Where is it?
[361:42.47]That is a... It is a scaling with int.
[361:47.78]Yeah.
[361:48.26]Rapier.
[361:50.14]Yeah.
[361:51.24]Yeah, yeah.
[361:51.74]Alright.
[361:57.06]You think we can kill this thing in three minutes?
[361:59.58]This thing?
[362:00.90]One hit.
[362:01.57]Okay.
[362:07.17]I don't think that we can.
[362:08.15]Well, let's just see what it is.
[362:12.01]We've got a fire.
[362:18.48]I hope it's a big dog.
[362:21.14]I really hope it's a way bigger dog.
[362:24.64]If it is a much bigger dog than what we've seen, then I'm happy about it.
[362:37.03]How much time do you have?
[362:38.75]Two minutes and 30 seconds.
[362:41.37]That's how long it's going to take to walk there.
[362:43.84]Well, then we'll walk there and see the big dog and just let it kill us.
[362:50.53]Then just close the game?
[362:51.61]We'll have to open the game and see a big dog.
[362:58.54]Alright, but it's going to take us a minute or two to kill these things anyways.
[363:02.42]Is yours coming up too?
[363:05.24]Uh, yeah.
[363:06.16]Alright.
[363:07.04]Let's just... I want to open this door and see what's in here because it's going to be cool.
[363:12.24]This guy is wearing the armor you buy when you get the DLC.
[363:17.08]Like, this is the pre-purchase pack armor.
[363:19.50]That's all glowing and everything.
[363:21.06]That's definitely like a Diablo 4 item shop armor.
[363:26.00]Yeah, like, okay.
[363:30.01]I can hear him fighting.
[363:30.91]Alright.
[363:32.57]Well, what do you think?
[363:34.61]We got a minute, minute and 30 seconds.
[363:37.35]What do you think?
[363:38.94]Tell me your woes.
[363:41.80]How do I sit?
[363:42.28]You're going to have to change out one of the settings.
[363:47.66]One of the emotes.
[363:51.64]Okay.
[363:54.52]Why are you holding your hand up like that?
[363:56.20]I don't know.
[363:56.84]Why are you being weird?
[363:58.86]I don't know.
[363:59.28]I just picked a sip one.
[364:02.00]I want to hold my hand up.
[364:03.06]Are you drinking?
[364:04.42]Oh, it's a toast.
[364:07.47]Let's do a toast of what we're about to see.
[364:11.67]But wait, we need to stand opposite each other.
[364:13.19]I'll be right here.
[364:13.87]Hold on.
[364:16.27]I don't think I have toast.
[364:18.69]You didn't talk to Sigward?
[364:21.11]No.
[364:23.47]I ain't talking to that guy.
[364:25.55]That guy's got some really weird stances.
[364:28.29]You don't want to be caught in a conversation with him.
[364:30.43]4.3 million channel points are on the line right now.
[364:33.87]I don't even know.
[364:34.25]What are you... Uh-oh.
[364:36.46]Alright.
[364:37.16]This will probably be maybe the last break.
[364:39.28]I think I'll probably... I've been going for like six hours.
[364:40.98]Maybe like another half hour, hour?
[364:41.98]How do you feel?
[364:46.84]Do you feel like that's accurate?
[364:49.55]uh I'm feeling great for whatever you're up to I'm good for like another hour maybe like another half an hour okay I'm gonna take a actual BRB this time and not be like where is it where is it I'll be right back and then we're gonna fight farah missoula in here yes we are a whole island and I'm not gonna be weird while he gets up this time
[365:27.40]You haven't left.
[365:28.52]What are you doing?
[365:29.14]You're like micro... Oh, wait.
[365:32.40]My sitting was wrong.
[365:33.24]Hold on.
[365:33.50]Hold on.
[365:35.88]Very weird.
[365:42.30]Especially weirder now that we are not talking.
[365:48.74]Weird.
[366:00.54]What do I think of Blade?
[366:03.60]The Wolfman in Elden Ring?
[366:05.98]A nice armor set, nice fur, looks fluffy.
[366:11.91]I can't imagine having to like wash your fur.
[366:16.29]When my hair grows out a little bit, it's like, oh, you have to like actually shampoo and wash and make sure it's like not gross, like six times a day.
[366:27.23]I'm in the toilet doing the swirly to myself just to get it properly shampooed.
[366:31.93]You had a full body of hair.
[366:34.31]No.
[366:41.12]You guys have never done the swirly?
[366:42.62]That's how you style to be one of the trolls.
[366:46.44]Troll movie?
[366:46.96]That's how you do that.
[366:56.12]That was big for a while.
[367:03.27]Yeah, the Jimmy Neutron.
[367:07.01]Jimmy Neutron wakes up and his dad toilets him.
[367:12.07]Dad's a bully in that show.
[367:28.62]You can wash your hair in the shower instead of the toilet.
[367:33.06]Um... Okay.
[367:48.47]Wait a minute.
[368:10.06]hello I am back don't tell Ster yet man I should have I should have went in and beat the boss before he came back I think I could have done it I think with that much like like spite energy
[368:30.68]Why can't you hear me?
[368:33.18]I was muted.
[368:34.80]Yeah, you were muted.
[368:35.32]You shouldn't be able to hear me then.
[368:38.36]I couldn't hear you.
[368:40.04]Oh.
[368:42.02]I have... Jerma, do you know this about me?
[368:45.68]Ashley denies it and it's infuriating.
[368:49.02]If I put something in the oven for 45 minutes, I'm walking back to the oven with like 30 seconds left on the timer every single time.
[368:59.12]You got that superpower?
[369:00.80]Yeah.
[369:03.42]Damn.
[369:03.78]Do you?
[369:04.12]I usually just check it.
[369:07.21]I check it every like 10 to 15 minutes to see how it's going.
[369:12.73]No, I nearly every single time, like even really long ones, like it was in there slow cooking for three hours.
[369:18.88]I'll walk over there and it'll be like one minute left.
[369:20.56]That's actually pretty remarkable, honestly.
[369:25.59]Thank you for acknowledging it.
[369:26.63]I've been waiting a long time for this.
[369:29.29]Is it actually every time?
[369:32.67]I would say, being totally honest, like 95% of the time.
[369:40.01]But does that time that goes by before you see it, it's like, oh, there's 10 seconds left, whatever.
[369:45.72]Is that a long time?
[369:47.12]Are you like, oh my God, when's the food going to be fucking ready?
[369:49.68]It's been like an hour.
[369:50.38]It's been two hours.
[369:50.88]Or are you just like, no, I'm good.
[369:53.79]I get up, I'm like, you know, it's probably ready.
[369:55.27]And I go there and it was ready.
[369:56.24]Because my problem is... It's my internal clock.
[369:59.50]Yeah, see, my problem is... It's set.
[370:01.38]It's like I, you know, okay, the turkey's in the oven.
[370:04.04]Alright, cool.
[370:04.86]It's going to be in there for like an hour or two hours or three or whatever it is.
[370:07.45]Is that a euphemism?
[370:09.61]We're talking about food in the oven.
[370:11.59]Turkey's in the oven.
[370:13.17]Okay.
[370:14.13]After 20 minutes, I'm just like, man, I want that turkey.
[370:17.03]And I go and I turn the oven light on.
[370:18.29]I'm like, how many, what, an hour into it?
[370:20.85]Fuck.
[370:21.63]I want it.
[370:22.41]Do you want the food?
[370:23.59]Because that's why you check.
[370:24.75]Because you're like, I want this.
[370:25.83]Was it ready yet?
[370:28.12]no I check because I think it's done like I'll sit there and think like I'm really hungry but like I'll know it's not ready yet and then I'll like it's probably done now and I go and it's usually like oh it's probably done and I walk there like holy shit no like again like another 10 seconds like holy like how does he know that's amazing I'm really I'm clued into the universe I feel like I know things that mere mortals can only begin to fathom ready to open the door no I want to talk about this for a little longer you want to keep talking about this yeah no this is this is very validating for me
[370:59.49]Nobody gets it.
[371:02.51]I keep, I keep getting brought down, you know, down a peg.
[371:06.05]So if I walk there and it's 30 seconds left, then someone will say, oh, well, 30 seconds isn't at the right time.
[371:10.71]But like 30 seconds when it was in there for an hour, you're really going to, you're really going to narrow it down to like, oh, it had to be like, what's, what's an impressive amount of time on an hour long oven?
[371:21.20]I'd say up to one minute is impressive.
[371:23.64]I'd say probably up to two minutes is impressive.
[371:25.18]Catching it every time up to two minutes.
[371:28.40]if it's two minutes my stats are going up like I'm getting on the like the the all-star team I'm not even talking two minutes oh you opened it okay yeah let's go I'm sorry no I that's an I like that conversation
[371:47.86]I like how much you wish you could do that.
[371:51.96]No, it kind of sucks.
[371:53.32]I saw like a bunch of mimic tears on the ground.
[371:56.35]I don't know.
[371:56.71]Yeah.
[371:56.87]What is dead here?
[371:58.63]Okay.
[371:59.05]You ready?
[371:59.57]Cut scene's going to be the same.
[372:01.45]And skip.
[372:02.57]Now.
[372:08.84]Oh, shit.
[372:10.56]It's the one true king.
[372:11.94]Is it multiple Lorians?
[372:15.39]I hope so.
[372:17.37]Abyss Lorien.
[372:21.17]It's not a phase.
[372:22.32]This is the brother.
[372:26.22]That's all I know.
[372:29.64]Shit.
[372:30.78]Don't kill me, please.
[372:32.24]Are we tagging in?
[372:32.94]We're tagging in?
[372:33.78]Are we tagging in?
[372:35.24]Yeah, you keep going.
[372:36.48]Alright, I got it.
[372:38.30]He's looking at me.
[372:40.36]Okay, you got him.
[372:41.92]I think you can beat him.
[372:46.46]Chaos!
[372:47.10]Oh shit, that actually hurt a lot.
[372:51.95]Did that hit him?
[372:53.53]Oh, it did.
[372:54.75]I was... I'm sorry, I'm messing with your flow state.
[372:59.09]Chaos!
[373:09.56]What?
[373:22.54]You want in on this?
[373:26.35]If you want me in on this, you're gonna, it's your call.
[373:29.41]There you take it.
[373:30.63]Tagging in?
[373:31.61]Tag.
[373:32.31]Alright.
[373:39.43]You're killing him so fast.
[373:41.67]He's fucking dead.
[373:42.87]He disintegrated.
[373:48.98]Well played.
[373:52.87]Well, we got him.
[373:54.93]What is actually dead on the ground?
[373:57.85]It's like a texture list, I guess, because it's texture didn't load in because he's not here.
[374:02.91]So it's just like metallic men.
[374:04.71]Yeah, this is this is a blender file.
[374:09.94]This is a this is weird.
[374:18.00]Well, we got it nice.
[374:21.87]Well done.
[374:25.49]Well done.
[374:25.83]Oh, don't we need like a, do we need like a cup here?
[374:28.83]Or do you not need an item?
[374:30.49]I forgot how many items this game needs in general to do things.
[374:33.53]It needs a lot.
[374:35.15]Because Elden Ring Randomizer, you don't really need a lot of items to like, oh, this door requires a golden key.
[374:43.89]Yeah, Dark Souls 3 sucks, dude.
[374:45.55]Okay, well, why are we... I'm kidding.
[374:51.98]They did do a co-op for Dark Souls one like a week ago as well.
[374:59.30]All this area has the funny don't spoil it.
[375:05.14]Well, it might not have them.
[375:08.72]No, I definitely will.
[375:09.48]It's a set piece.
[375:19.02]Now this is a run through area.
[375:23.52]You don't like this area?
[375:26.02]Um, more that it's just easier to run through.
[375:29.87]There's like nothing here.
[375:31.23]It's a very big area.
[375:32.23]Just reminds me of a gigantic chalice dungeon.
[375:34.49]I think that's why I don't really love it.
[375:39.11]Holy shit.
[375:43.03]Oh, that's a big dog.
[375:44.35]Uh, that's a dog-human hybrid.
[375:47.60]That doesn't hit the sand.
[375:58.50]That's a big dog-human hybrid.
[376:00.32]Oh, dude.
[376:02.98]Dark Souls 3's biggest dog-human hybrid.
[376:09.64]We keep really moving the goalpost here.
[376:11.68]Yeah.
[376:13.46]Then it's going to be the biggest human.
[376:14.83]We already saw the biggest human.
[376:15.89]I got to do a video next week.
[376:17.09]Like, come on.
[376:17.53]What's like the biggest... We got to find the biggest everything in the game.
[376:32.79]You think that's funny?
[376:34.61]No, because I heard he did it by accident.
[376:38.10]Ow.
[376:39.84]I almost slid down the ladder as... Oh.
[376:44.84]I have a lot of souls by the way.
[376:46.12]How many souls do you have?
[376:48.18]30,000.
[376:48.60]I'm not using the boss souls because they might end up being like key items.
[376:56.30]Oh.
[376:56.78]From the rewards.
[376:58.36]You can use them.
[376:59.00]I'm not using them.
[377:00.40]Hawkwood sword graft?
[377:16.20]Where did my health go?
[377:17.32]You got smushed.
[377:19.88]I thought I had way more than that.
[377:21.62]When he hit me, I had like none left already.
[377:25.70]Whoops.
[377:27.32]Well, that just happened.
[377:30.70]Great move.
[377:36.65]Really good move.
[377:44.55]can you defend my souls for me uh I can I'm here everything seems make sure no one no one else comes up and grabs them there's been a lot of like uh aggressive pvp years lately can't reach from over here really
[378:14.13]I knew that was going to fucking happen.
[378:15.23]I knew it.
[378:15.77]I knew that was going to happen and I just still... I still was just trying to do it.
[378:20.42]I'll defend your souls.
[378:21.98]I'm just waiting.
[378:22.60]I was waiting for him and I was like, okay, this is a fun mini game until the Ster gets back here and then whatever.
[378:26.56]I knew it was going to happen.
[378:35.27]I was really trying to stay on there too.
[378:36.87]Did you fall?
[378:37.53]Yes, I did.
[378:40.33]Why would you do that?
[378:43.60]Because there's somebody across the way shooting at us.
[378:49.14]And I thought it would be smart to get rid of them.
[378:56.29]I'm not smart.
[379:03.43]Don't say that.
[379:04.41]Do you think you're smart?
[379:06.57]But do you think you're smart?
[379:08.45]Yeah.
[379:09.79]I do too.
[379:10.59]I actually think you're very intelligent.
[379:15.28]Have you actually ever done an IQ test before?
[379:16.86]Ever?
[379:18.02]I did a really short one that can't be held.
[379:20.10]I feel like you score pretty high.
[379:24.02]What is a high score?
[379:26.02]Anything over like 120?
[379:26.66]One like 10, 115?
[379:29.34]The short one I did, I had like 130 something.
[379:31.34]What?
[379:31.46]You have 130 something IQ?
[379:33.36]Yeah.
[379:44.03]one like 10 to 120 is like a little bit like it wasn't a long form test it was a very short one that has like way worse results okay did you click on an ad to do this one no it was it was at an official place oh okay so but like normal iq tests are really big and have like eight categories this one was like super short like 20 minutes of just like a general gauge
[380:13.11]Uh, you're like close to genius level then.
[380:17.20]Yeah, it's too bad I wasted my life on all this shit.
[380:25.36]Dude, super omega genius.
[380:29.17]And he's playing Dark Souls 3 with some like 94 IQ fucking dummy.
[380:33.65]90 doesn't sound that low.
[380:37.55]No, my IQ is actually like 120.
[380:41.12]yes it was we've had it tested okay I wish I had a laugh track I could play did you did you do the full like uh like a long one then you know what I'm saying I okay when I was like 16 oh that explains it they hold on I did I took one I took it took about three hours I took when I was 16 and took when I was 22.
[381:06.59]When I was 16, I had a really, really like, oh my god, this is bad.
[381:12.58]Something's wrong with you.
[381:14.76]I forget my performance IQ.
[381:18.03]My performance IQ was like, this is like, there's something wrong with you.
[381:23.14]My- all the other ones were, like, off the charts.
[381:25.66]I'm being brought down by my, like, performance- I- my, like, just- one of my, like, hemispheres of my brain just sucks.
[381:32.16]The other ones are just, like, fucking could- can't be stopped.
[381:34.80]That's what's stopping it.
[381:36.47]I have a nerf.
[381:37.31]I have a limiter on my brain.
[381:39.45]Uh, wrong way.
[381:43.05]Wait, is that- no, that's not the wrong way.
[381:44.81]Is it?
[381:47.98]Yeah, it is.
[381:48.76]You're supposed to be the genius.
[381:49.82]Where are we going?
[381:51.00]Well, I was listening to your enthralling story.
[381:52.76]I'm really interested and engaged in this.
[381:55.21]And so what do you mean when you say performance?
[381:57.39]Of like, you can, you're really smart in your head.
[382:00.25]And then once it comes out into the real world, it's all gone.
[382:02.91]There's like the moment you open your mouth.
[382:04.83]There's a few.
[382:05.55]What did you just say?
[382:13.49]Don't step on it again to try to prove that I wasn't going to dodge it.
[382:18.58]uh no I I think it's like 115 or something at this point 110. I took yeah I took one on stream and I got 98. it was a online 20 minute it doesn't that doesn't matter it was 98.5 yeah it was a joke test well you just opened up a secret door didn't notice and walked away
[382:45.45]I need you to come over here and perform right now.
[382:47.27]Dude, look at how fucking high that IQ was figuring that out, but then walking away.
[382:50.97]You were so smart, you didn't even know what you were doing, but it was right.
[382:58.76]Actually, I didn't know I did that.
[383:03.08]I didn't know that was there.
[383:05.62]Like I said, I usually run through here.
[383:09.66]I don't know that I've ever actually done this zone.
[383:13.55]How?
[383:14.61]Without like fully exploring it.
[383:18.77]I don't know how.
[383:20.33]I got a lot of souls.
[383:21.19]I'm going to be throwing massive fireballs soon.
[383:24.06]So again, I'm sorry I missed it.
[383:25.16]When you say performance, is that like a ballet?
[383:28.44]I think it just means that... So when I was in school, I fucking didn't like school.
[383:33.30]I really didn't enjoy it.
[383:35.24]It was... I knew how to do this stuff, but I just didn't like to do it.
[383:41.27]So it's like, oh, can you do this math problem?
[383:43.05]I'm like, yeah, I can do it.
[383:44.56]We'll do it.
[383:44.98]And I'm like, no, I don't want to say, oh, well, OK, but you can do the you can do it, though.
[383:50.36]Yeah, I can.
[383:53.48]And I guess enough of that over over time that you we're going in circles.
[384:00.45]This way.
[384:02.24]But I mean, I was diagnosed with ADHD very early on.
[384:06.34]I remember I was... Dude, you want to hear something crazy?
[384:10.93]When Ritalin first came out, I was one of the people that could take it.
[384:16.21]It had just come out.
[384:18.69]And I hated it.
[384:19.81]I didn't like it at all.
[384:21.93]Ritalin and Adderall came out.
[384:24.27]They were like being... Essentially, it was like, oh yeah, you can do this now.
[384:29.35]I didn't like either one of them.
[384:30.87]I didn't like how it made me feel at all.
[384:34.41]It felt like I was... I was never... I didn't, like, need to eat.
[384:37.37]It was weird.
[384:39.89]Was it meth?
[384:42.27]Effectively, that's what those two things... Chemically, it's kind of in the same field, isn't it?
[384:46.44]Uh, I don't... I don't know anything about this.
[384:52.56]I'll trust you.
[384:55.30]yeah isn't this the way we came from we are we are really just I knew that it was but like I'm starting to doubt myself I'm starting to get real concerned it's alright it's alright we okay let me I know this game we jump we jump off we jump over here don't we no we've been down there no we go we got to get over there this way follow me
[385:23.85]Man, I hope there's no big dogs down here.
[385:29.41]Yeah, I used to oven in school.
[385:32.31]So instead of it being a timer, it was getting a D. I was very good at getting Ds.
[385:36.64]Watch out for the boulder.
[385:45.04]I also... Math problems were not... I hated them.
[385:50.26]I just hated math.
[385:52.64]I love the concept of math.
[385:54.54]I just don't like doing it.
[385:57.64]It's true.
[385:58.17]It just is.
[385:58.63]What the fuck does that mean?
[385:59.97]I just like... I think math is too... I love that there's an underlying mathematical existence to the universe and everything can be explained with math and physics.
[386:10.11]I just fucking...
[386:12.84]I just don't like to do it.
[386:13.56]Don't tell me about it.
[386:14.54]No, no, no, no.
[386:15.14]Just, I don't, with the piece of paper in my hand.
[386:18.42]And, okay, let me do a bunch of long division.
[386:20.16]I'm like, no, get out of here.
[386:21.91]But, like, doing the calculations and understanding what, like, percentage is being scaled in Dark Souls.
[386:29.01]That's like, ooh, that's cool.
[386:30.37]That's super interesting to me.
[386:32.13]I just don't like, don't give me the paper to do it.
[386:34.37]Because it's like, I'll, yeah.
[386:41.75]Okay, I won't.
[386:44.18]You like doing math?
[386:46.94]I really did when I was in school.
[386:48.84]Like, I remember we learned long division, and I was so excited about it that I wanted to, like, show kids in the neighborhood.
[386:57.99]I don't worry.
[386:58.75]I'm not that big of a dork anymore.
[387:01.07]So you were a dork, is what you're saying?
[387:02.73]No, no.
[387:03.65]I was one of the cool kids.
[387:05.55]Hey, man, let's throw the football around.
[387:07.50]Oh, man, let's play tag.
[387:09.34]Would anybody like to try some long division?
[387:10.68]Okay, not that cool.
[387:16.96]Watch out.
[387:24.84]Oh, come on.
[387:26.20]I had to ruin it for you.
[387:29.70]Still did it.
[387:32.44]Come on.
[387:37.68]Math was fun until I added letters.
[387:40.58]Yeah, I mean I I I math is cool.
[387:44.22]Learning go learn.
[387:47.09]I think you drop down here.
[387:48.11]Yeah, you drop down here and go left.
[387:51.09]There's items over there though.
[387:52.03]Let me just see if there's anything over here that's worth it.
[387:55.25]Because we do need the doll.
[387:57.83]Yes.
[388:00.29]Tears of Denial.
[388:00.77]I do recall there being a relevant room down here.
[388:05.29]What the hell hurt me that bad?
[388:16.76]Lightning urn, dragon scale ring.
[388:19.65]Uh... You want me to drop down?
[388:22.41]Should I keep looking?
[388:24.61]Um... There's a bunch of bullshit down here.
[388:27.23]Should drop.
[388:41.30]This is actually better because it's usually the bone wheel skeletons down here.
[388:45.20]It is hell on Earth down here.
[388:47.11]It is.
[388:56.99]What the hell?
[389:09.75]I don't want to lose all these souls.
[389:10.87]I got a lot.
[389:21.07]Okay.
[389:22.88]Okay.
[389:24.48]That's what you sound like.
[389:25.96]I do that all the time.
[389:32.86]I think there actually is a... Remember the biggest secret wall here?
[389:34.60]There is a wall here somewhere.
[389:48.72]I think the help.
[389:49.64]Where are you?
[389:50.50]Help, help.
[389:52.86]Help.
[389:54.64]Help.
[390:03.55]Around the corner, it's not here.
[390:04.71]It doesn't.
[390:05.01]The boulder have to break the wall or something.
[390:08.67]Another might be another one.
[390:09.55]I think there's can you fireball these things down here?
[390:12.65]Buster up on the ceiling.
[390:18.23]uh probably teamwork oh your hand's empty got no more I can do this though
[390:41.00]Everyone missed.
[390:42.00]Do you think all these moves that are like Firestorm in all the FromSoftware games... Do you think Miyazaki... People make them in each game and he looks over and goes... Yeah, that sucks.
[390:51.60]Perfect.
[390:53.38]Yes.
[390:55.96]I think so.
[391:05.63]Firestorm is literally the best spell.
[391:11.73]That guy, he's from Firestorm Inc.
[391:15.01]Don't listen to him.
[391:15.69]Oh, it's a plant.
[391:21.17]Humble the wizards, I respect it.
[391:30.85]No, we need to have unlimited power.

[395:46.73]I'm about to find out.
[395:47.65]Yeah, we're good.

[396:37.35]No.
[396:38.03]And he wants to live all like the golden days again.
[396:40.35]And he's going to take you to elementary school in a car.
[396:44.17]Like everything that a kid would do, you have to do again.
[396:46.45]So it's just Billy Madison, but in real life?
[396:51.17]I guess.
[396:56.18]You have to?
[396:58.38]Well, if you agree, yes.
[397:00.08]Very well, then take it.
[397:02.82]Okay, it's time to dump this into faith.
[397:13.59]I want enough to do my pyromancy thing.
[397:22.33]He starts you from a baby and you have to be in your crib.
[397:27.30]He wants the full experience.
[397:33.19]Oh, pyromancer gloves.
[397:34.79]But like you get to grow up fast.
[397:47.20]Do not beg God.
[397:48.00]What is it?
[397:53.30]Okay, would you get to live your whole life again?
[397:55.65]Is there a teleportation mechanic here or what?
[398:02.08]What is it?
[398:02.60]No, this is like role play.
[398:06.04]So like within the course of a year, you would role play from like age one to age eight.
[398:12.29]You need this.
[398:14.43]How do we turn his mic off?
[398:17.01]Why you asked me the question?
[398:18.67]We need to cut his mic off as soon as possible.
[398:24.87]Alright, I'm ready to play.
[398:29.81]OK.
[398:35.76]Wait a minute, I want to hear more.

[398:41.45]We're gonna turn his television off.
[398:46.93]Okay, it's not Miyazaki.
[398:48.01]You can pick whoever it is, but you still have to be their baby boy.
[398:53.07]Is there anyone you would turn it for?
[398:57.75]Um, let me think.

[400:15.51]I didn't know there was a staircase here.
[400:18.33]We have to get the doll.

[407:54.08]Can we at least kill this guy?
[407:55.06]Can we at least like make that guy fall down?
[408:13.93]Yeah, the guy to cut, I guess, is randomized.
[408:18.58]Don't!
[408:19.18]You're gonna have to fight this boss, by the way, because I have no Estus.
[408:28.60]Okay.
[408:30.94]You lost all your Estus?
[408:32.66]I was finding that frost giant thing.
[408:44.33]Well, we'll have to see what the boss is.
[408:46.03]Thing actually.
[408:54.03]Whoa, wait a minute.
[408:54.63]This thing is amazing.
[408:57.48]How much does it take to do that?
[409:00.20]Not very much.
[409:02.24]Alright, let's see.
[409:02.80]What do we get?
[409:04.43]Ready?
[409:05.59]Yep.
[409:06.33]Go.
[409:10.27]Oh, he's dead.
[409:13.85]How do they handle this?
[409:20.59]Oh no, it's Highlord Gundyr.
[409:33.81]Whoa, he has a grab?
[409:35.83]Is this the champion Gundyr version?
[409:37.05]Or is it just regular Gundyr?
[409:39.96]I think it's, I mean, I don't remember the first one having a grab.
[410:07.45]Nice dude.
[410:08.57]Clean.
[410:14.92]Oh, the talisman.
[410:17.72]I'm on fire.
[410:25.14]Do you see yourself in this cutscene?
[410:27.01]No, I see you.
[410:29.47]Good.
[410:37.38]Right.
[410:40.36]Alright, I think that's, I think that's it for me.
[410:42.62]No.
[410:42.74]What do you mean no?
[410:44.96]Come.
[410:46.63]Well, let me at least rest.
[410:48.31]No, come.
[410:49.07]Alright.
[410:52.81]You didn't even get the item over here.
[410:54.97]What item?
[410:56.22]There is a twinkling Titanite.
[411:09.35]Where?
[411:09.61]Did you make this up?
[411:10.77]No, still left.
[411:14.09]Around the corner.
[411:15.46]I don't believe you.
[411:17.78]You don't have to.
[411:19.30]So see, this is where this playthrough just got so screwed because the doll could be literally anywhere.
[411:26.29]We cannot do this until we have the doll.
[411:32.62]I think there was some setting for this in the randomizers specifically, but I can't remember.
[411:39.63]Oh yeah, no, it's guaranteed before this is what I think the option is.
[411:43.29]Hold on, do we get to see who's on the bridge?
[411:47.43]I think we can see what's on the bridge.
[411:48.63]We just can't go past the bridge.
[411:51.58]Let's take a look.
[412:02.29]Big rat!
[412:03.21]Biggest rat in Elden Ring!
[412:05.18]That's the biggest rat in the biggest scene.
[412:08.40]Hold on, I gotta get my recording software ready.
[412:09.62]Don't kill it.
[412:11.68]Actually, we got it.
[412:12.50]Nice.
[412:20.18]Elden Ring.
[412:20.62]I keep calling it Elden Ring.
[412:23.99]I mean, to be fair, Elden Ring was like a 400-hour experience, and it... Okay, think about this.
[412:29.74]I'm your grandfather, and I can't remember, but Jimmy or John or you, Jacob, were... Oh, no, but Dark Souls 1 is like a 40-50-hour experience.
[412:38.40]Dark Souls 2, 50-60 hours.
[412:39.04]Dark Souls 3, like 40-50 hours.
[412:40.06]Bloodborne, like 30-40-50 hours or so, just to play through.
[412:47.97]Elden Ring is like 300 hours.
[412:49.80]It's all the games, like, three times.
[412:51.94]So you've played so much more of that game without even realizing it.
[412:57.24]John... Jacob... Fingalheimers... This name...
[413:13.15]Are you going to keep going or are you just going to do the... No, I just am really happy that I basically mind controlled you.
[413:21.96]My pawn.
[413:23.58]I could get him to do exactly as I wanted.
[413:25.76]He has trigger words like a sleeper agent.
[413:27.92]No, no, no.
[413:28.74]I'm sorry.
[413:29.16]You cannot go to a parakeet and be like... And the parakeet goes... And you go, I mind controlled a parakeet.
[413:37.41]No, it's just a parakeet.
[413:38.45]That's what a bird does.
[413:41.27]I don't know.
[413:41.69]You seem in this anger where you're like coming back at me.
[413:44.25]I feel like that's also I mind controlled you.
[413:50.18]Welcome home, man.
[413:51.18]Do you even think for yourself?
[413:53.66]Freaking me out, man.
[413:54.66]Freaking me out.
[413:55.45]Shut up.
[413:56.53]Stop.
[413:57.23]You're freaking me out.
[413:59.03]Oh no.
[414:03.03]Should I do?
[414:05.07]I need like dexterity.
[414:10.84]Dexterity or attunement?
[414:15.16]15.
[414:15.38]How much dex do I need to have it not be slow casting?
[414:20.20]15?
[414:20.86]From this angle, it looks like you're wearing a Japanese schoolgirl skirt.
[414:24.39]Oh, we stood up.
[414:25.21]What the fuck are you talking about?
[414:36.65]I mean, on my screen, you'd get it if you saw my screen.
[414:39.46]We're not going to use any of this shit.
[414:41.26]I'm getting rid of all of it.
[414:52.04]Alright.
[414:53.20]Wait, no, you can even tell now.
[414:54.62]Yeah, you guys are seeing it.
[414:56.78]Wait, what?
[414:58.02]Did you just think that was like a big meaty legs?
[415:01.57]No, no.
[415:02.41]Don't worry about it.
[415:05.93]You're cute.
[415:12.10]I see you.
[415:16.48]Oh, you're going to be doing this all night because of the seed that I planted.
[415:19.98]You're going to be laying down to go to bed and be like, fuck, I don't want to say it because he brought it up, but like, I have to do it.
[415:28.94]You remember in Roger Rabbit?
[415:29.78]I can't let him win.
[415:30.28]You remember in Roger Rabbit with the judges walking around, banging on the walls, being like, shave and a haircut.
[415:37.78]No.
[415:37.90]What do you mean?

[415:41.73]Maybe when I was like.
[415:44.27]Three years old.
[415:46.12]You need to watch that movie as a grown up.
[415:49.90]That movie is great.
[415:51.30]Go experience it and actually understand what's going on in it.
[415:54.52]Roger Rabbit, you would love it.
[415:56.08]You would actually really like it.
[415:56.97]I'm not kidding.
[415:58.91]OK.
[416:00.66]This isn't one of those other like weird movies you keep making me watch.
[416:04.82]No, this is.

[416:09.58]I think it's free on YouTube.
[416:10.80]You can go get it on.
[416:11.52]I think you can watch it on YouTube free.
[416:16.82]That's not a weird movie, is it?
[416:18.18]Well, I mean it is a weird movie, but it's a great movie.
[416:22.39]It holds up though.
[416:24.11]It does absolutely OK.
[416:27.47]I'll check it'll check.
[416:28.27]I'll check a look.
[416:32.36]alright dude uh no I don't know how this saves I don't know what happens to this save file but I guess we'll just maybe do this again oh yeah yeah yeah yeah no good good run we definitely beat it today good seven hours it was fun I mean to be fair we did get like halfway through the game but it if the real we're this is pretty far in the game
[416:57.01]Um, it is.
[416:59.65]You know what?
[417:00.91]You know what about Dark Souls 3?
[417:02.43]Yeah.
[417:03.93]The next area, Ithril, sucks.
[417:06.61]Sucks.
[417:08.99]It has its own little like swamp on the bottom.
[417:14.02]And then the area after Ithril where you're like jumping across all the rooftops.
[417:17.90]Yeah, that area sucks.
[417:19.10]Sucks.
[417:20.38]That area sucks, doesn't it?
[417:22.24]Yeah.
[417:22.52]It's like four or five of these in a row.
[417:26.42]You know, and they told me Dark Souls 2 is bad.
[417:27.84]You know, I'm seeing it now.
[417:28.76]I haven't played this in a long time.
[417:30.28]Actually, Irithyll Dungeon is actually the worst thing in the whole game.
[417:35.36]You've said that about like three zones.
[417:37.34]No, but that, okay, we're not doing randomizer.
[417:39.32]You're talking about the guys that can drain your max health down to one HP.
[417:43.64]And it's the worst area.
[417:45.62]Dark Souls 3 has like four of these in a row.
[417:48.16]The Swamp.
[417:49.41]I thought the Swamp was the worst.
[417:51.31]That's what I mean.
[417:51.77]There's like four or five of these in a row that are just like, oh, this one kind of sucks.
[417:54.31]This one kind of sucks.
[417:55.55]But then later, the DLC areas are actually really great.
[417:59.15]I think the Dark Souls 3 DLC areas might be some of the best DLC areas that they've ever done.
[418:04.90]I think they're really cool.
[418:05.60]I didn't play any of the Ring City.
[418:07.62]I did like the first zone and I just wasn't feeling it.
[418:12.38]I think when it came out.
[418:15.16]It's fun.
[418:16.62]I heard it was good.
[418:17.42]I felt bad that I didn't play the whole thing.
[418:19.48]I'm not saying I didn't feel it as it was bad.
[418:22.70]It was good.
[418:23.48]I just didn't feel like playing a lot of like Dark Souls around that time.
[418:27.83]So I hope we make it there.
[418:28.47]It was really hard too.
[418:29.69]I remember that.
[418:30.29]I would like to see it.
[418:31.93]It was like very difficult.
[418:33.49]It was one of those things where they do, for some reason, I think they started doing that in Dark Souls 3 DLC where, hey, fight this boss, but fight like two people at the same time.
[418:43.80]Now fight like, now they have three phases.
[418:46.68]It was like, okay, man.
[418:49.96]Yeah, they reached a peak of like the painted boss having three phases and trying to one up.
[418:57.10]Yeah.
[418:58.66]Reed was the first.
[419:00.56]Yeah, just having the multiple people in the room and multiple phases and... You say that... I say they reached a peak and then they hit us with Radon.
[419:09.90]Radon 2.
[419:11.92]Yeah, but honestly, Elden Ring was just so, so, so, so ridiculous.
[419:18.56]It's alright.
[419:19.84]It's alright.
[419:21.36]I can forgive that. ...
[419:29.63]Yeah, thanks for playing, Ster.
[419:30.79]Thanks for hanging out.
[419:31.45]Oh, shit!
[419:32.50]Sorry!
[419:32.80]Are you killing NPCs in here?
[419:34.28]I hit her!
[419:36.44]Don't... If you kill that NPC, the run's over, by the way.
[419:38.82]I know, I know.
[419:39.55]I'm sorry.
[419:40.09]It almost killed her.
[419:41.37]I'm leaving.
[419:42.41]Don't... Please do not kill the level-up NPC.
[419:45.99]I was just throwing bombs at you as a joke.
[419:51.40]Alright, so are we actually doing something tomorrow?
[419:53.88]What time is this happening?
[419:55.86]It sounded like Vinny is here tomorrow at 8 Eastern, which would be... 5.
[420:03.76]Okay.
[420:04.40]Okay.
[420:04.56]Yeah, and then we're going to do Long Drive.
[420:08.62]So I guess we'll be playing Long Drive tomorrow at 5 o'clock Pacific.
[420:12.66]So late night stream.
[420:14.83]Yep.
[420:15.77]Poke didn't confirm, but he'll probably be there anyway.
[420:18.41]He'll go OK and just be.
[420:20.15]Oh yeah.
[420:21.83]Alright dude, I'll talk to you later.
[420:24.53]See you and thank you.
[420:25.23]It was a lot of fun.
[420:26.11]Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[420:27.81]Good night.
[420:28.81]Yeah, good night.
[420:33.40]That was Dark Souls 3 randomizer seamless Co-op.
[420:35.70]Actually, it was very seamless.
[420:36.84]We had the one drop from the Steam servers, but.
[420:40.66]That was great.
[420:43.52]Makes the game a little easier, but I mean, that's the nature of doing a randomizer like this.
[420:47.68]You might get some enemy that's easy to kill.
[420:50.62]It's fun, though.
[420:51.60]Had a good time.
[420:54.89]So I guess we'll see you tomorrow.
[420:57.73]After tomorrow, though, I'm going to be gone for a few days.
[421:02.83]Probably two or three days.
[421:05.07]I do have a lot of stuff I have to get taken care of and done.
[421:11.26]Appreciate it.
[421:13.77]See you soon.
[421:14.81]See you later.
[421:16.86]Obviously, thanks for all these subs that came in.
[421:19.66]Looks like there was a lot today.
[421:21.52]Credits seem to be going for a while.
[421:24.95]So, thanks guys.
[421:27.21]See you later.
[421:49.54]Thank you.
