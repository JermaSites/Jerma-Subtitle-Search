[ve:61.1.100]

[00:04.91]Okay, what's up?
[00:05.87]Starting now, I am going to be the RTV, no, RTD.
[00:12.96]I'm going to be the tryhard of the crit server, okay?
[00:17.91]I'm going to be that guy.
[00:24.56]Okay, starting now, I'm going to be the RTV, RTD, roll the dice champion, no flame war, kill the guy, pony, double octopus, Half-Life 3 confirmed, I'm going in the paint ham.
[00:40.19]That's pretty good.
[00:41.89]That's a lot of adjectives.
[00:44.27]Yes, so if anyone kills me, they're probably going to be cheating with how hard I'm trying right now.
[00:51.64]though I don't know this map at all, so I have no idea what's going on.
[00:54.12]Let's RTD champion.
[00:57.54]As soon as I go to type RTD, David Bowie!
[01:01.96]Do I even have my RTD?
[01:06.34]I can't use it because you're using it?
[01:09.28]Yeah, you have to wait.
[01:10.74]I gained a super amount of health.
[01:12.00]Now it's time to just go in and be the I'm gonna kill you.
[01:17.14]Don't kill me.
[01:18.10]Not you.
[01:18.94]You're my friendly.
[01:23.43]David Bowie, eat that.
[01:24.41]Oh, we're just going to walk at this guy.
[01:27.10]I got health.
[01:27.58]I got health to spare.
[01:28.30]I got health for days.
[01:29.34]You don't even know what health is.
[01:31.12]Oh, we're going for a spawn shot.
[01:37.64]Did I get him?
[01:39.82]No.
[01:46.95]This is like the best RTD you could possibly RTD.
[01:53.33]I have a new strat.
[01:55.47]New strategy.
[01:58.32]You're gonna need some new strats first.
[02:01.58]Wait, what?
[02:03.82]I just said a new strategy.
[02:04.98]Are you not listening to me?
[02:06.40]No.
[02:07.74]I have to be honest.
[02:09.66]I stopped.
[02:11.28]Alright.
[02:11.90]Widowmaker OP.
[02:12.78]Here we go.
[02:17.21]Ooh, Choppa OP.
[02:18.89]This David Bowie looking sensei, he wasn't like, he wasn't of Asian descent, was he?
[02:26.14]I hit that guy so many times.
[02:29.18]David Bowie is a singer.
[02:30.88]David, no, I thought he was, um, he saved the Alamo.
[02:34.85]David Bowie.
[02:35.57]Am I not thinking of the right David Bowie?
[02:37.23]You are not thinking of the right David Bowie.
[02:39.03]In fact, you couldn't be more incorrect with your David Bowie interpretation.
[02:44.11]Well, isn't there a David Bowie of the Alamo?
[02:48.06]the hell are you talking about no Alamo yeah the Bowie knife that's where Bowie knives come from because he made a song about it about the Alamo date David Bowie did this Mr.. David Bowie yeah who then who was the guy at the Alamo Tonto Dave Dave from Wendy's like David Bowie just killed me
[03:14.97]All he uses is his knife too.
[03:16.93]He doesn't know that like the enforcer does knife damage No, he just hit me with the enforcer.
[03:21.74]He just fucked me.
[03:22.82]He just fucked my shit up with Wow Wow don't don't You know Can we have a real talk here no Good cuz I didn't want to do one again with what alright seriously David Bowie you're down here in a corner Where the fuck is he?
[03:41.70]He's on me, and you don't... He's taunting.
[03:44.71]Why is he taunting?
[03:46.79]He finally got a kill with the Diamondback, which gets crits when you sap.
[03:53.33]Yeah, come on.
[03:53.89]He's David Bowie.
[03:54.77]He doesn't need an explanation.
[03:56.01]I know.
[03:56.35]He saved the Alamo one-on-one.
[03:59.67]I'm looking this up.
[04:02.23]I'm looking up this Alamo David Bowie thing.
[04:05.05]Why?
[04:05.23]Because I want to see if it's true or not.
[04:08.91]Are you true?
[04:09.41]You're going to be true to me?
[04:12.08]Yes.
[04:18.54]David Bowie.
[04:24.22]Oh, watch your flank.
[04:24.72]We don't even need the sniper rifle.
[04:25.88]Watch your flank.
[04:26.54]Oh, headshots, headshots.
[04:28.46]Watch it.
[04:30.62]Playing Counter-Strike over here.
[04:34.26]Oh, look it, I'm dodging.
[04:36.34]I just froze up so bad.
[04:38.45]I couldn't go left and I couldn't go right.
[04:41.90]There's gonna be a scout behind our vicinity.
[04:44.04]I'm so scared with this RTD nonsense, I'm gonna RT'd.
[04:49.46]Ah, good.
[04:49.93]I froze.
[04:50.45]I did it.
[04:50.87]I froze.
[04:51.83]I can't use it because you- I never understood that.
[04:54.95]It's to make it so you can't just, like, spam it so people aren't just, like, flying all over the place like insane at all times.
[05:01.31]I guess that is nice.
[05:03.29]I think only, like, two people are allowed to have it on at one time.
[05:06.27]David Bowie is the best in the server!
[05:11.62]Soviet Toaster is... He got my killstreak.
[05:14.38]I was at 11.
[05:15.46]The only way you can win this is if you have the highest killstreak at the end.
[05:19.94]Do you know how this works?
[05:21.34]Is that really how you win?
[05:22.28]No, but, like, who cares about orange other than, like, how many kills you had?
[05:27.16]Like, be real.
[05:28.79]Why is this heavy?
[05:29.69]Whoa!
[05:32.03]I was behind the wall!
[05:33.15]I'm gonna... I could go Soldier, but I'm not... No, no, no.
[05:41.12]That's dishonorable.
[05:42.58]We go crazy with them choppers.
[05:44.78]That's what we do.
[05:45.58]We're playing Counter-Strike.
[05:47.18]There's no other option.
[05:50.62]And sometimes we got the... I don't have the Opera Hand, okay?
[05:53.39]So leave me alone on that one.
[05:56.29]Just leave him alone.
[05:58.11]Yes, I love it.
[06:07.15]Seriously?
[06:08.21]The other guy didn't, like, help me out?
[06:10.01]The other guy didn't help you, Mr. Potter.
[06:13.01]What is that supposed to be, an impression of your mom?
[06:15.05]He doesn't want you to be disappointed.
[06:19.59]We are going to work together to kill David Bowie together.
[06:25.51]Do not disappoint me.
[06:26.81]I thought that was your David Bowie impression.
[06:29.33]No, that's... No, no, that's like what he sounds like in the original movie.
[06:34.32]No, he doesn't.
[06:35.26]What you- that was Solid Snake?
[06:37.19]No, Solid Snake!
[06:39.49]I'm- I see feet, I see feet, I see feet, I see feet, I- there's- that's someone else, he's on- he's dead.
[06:45.57]Dude, I just tried to kill David Bowie, and like, I was too busy listening to what you thought I was doing.
[06:51.19]Solid Snake.
[06:53.23]Like, oh, Metal Gear, no, what are you talking- that was Snape from Harry Potter.
[06:58.72]Metal Snape?
[07:00.92]See now, you're just being an idiot.
[07:03.34]No, there's a metal version of everything in Sonic.
[07:05.52]Or no, Mario.
[07:06.80]No, Sonic.
[07:08.00]Hmm, same franchise?
[07:08.96]Sonic, Mario.
[07:09.44]Sonic, Mario.
[07:10.18]AHHHHH!
[07:11.86]He missed the scout!
[07:13.40]Demo's banned.
[07:14.07]How am I ever going to get up to my killsteak prestige gold weapon?
[07:19.59]Never gonna happen.
[07:20.51]I was like hiding up top, you know, trying to be a wee bit sneaky.
[07:24.21]But like, David Bowie's just gonna appear out of nowhere with like, some sort of crazy best player in the video game.
[07:32.63]heavy is going to kill me through like that same wall.
[07:34.87]Oh, the heavy.
[07:35.67]You know what?
[07:36.03]I'm going to go with some double dunk, double dunk, double dunk.
[07:38.31]No, no, no.
[07:38.85]There's nothing else.
[07:39.55]We're doing this with AK.
[07:40.71]Dude, there's nothing else.
[07:42.19]We're going to double dunk, double dunk, double dunk, double dunk, double dunk.
[07:45.21]Shut up.
[07:46.33]Shut up.
[07:47.73]No one wants to hear you.
[07:50.23]They're here for me.
[07:52.43]Watch it.
[07:53.15]Watch it.
[07:53.97]Watch it.
[07:54.35]There's a scout.
[07:57.89]David Bowie.
[07:58.51]I felt David Bowie there.
[08:01.21]Felt him.
[08:03.13]We're doing one life as... I don't have anything on this account.
[08:08.91]Do I even have Gunboats?
[08:10.09]I have Gunboats.
[08:11.21]No, dude, this guy... No, dude, what?
[08:17.75]Oh, boy, I got a double cheeseburger right there.
[08:20.31]Oh, no, I didn't.
[08:23.27]Let's go with an RTD.
[08:24.23]Here we go.
[08:25.41]No, I keep forgetting to RTD.
[08:28.21]Why am I getting every terrible one that's here?
[08:31.38]Oh, I'm not critting right now.
[08:32.60]Great.
[08:33.98]That's great.
[08:35.86]Cool.
[08:37.92]Give me a break.
[08:40.54]Un fucking believable.
[08:44.32]I gotta feel it.
[08:49.34]Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[08:53.32]Can't do that.
[08:53.82]That's copyrighted.
[08:55.99]I know.
[08:56.71]That's why this part's... You just edit it out.
[08:58.37]Go ahead.
[08:58.75]Edit it out.
[08:59.11]I don't know how to edit.
[09:01.01]It's been a while.
[09:02.51]You go to www.editor.org.
[09:05.93]You go to www.www.www... Whoa, whoa.
[09:08.89]There's a whole secret tunnel?
[09:10.07]There's a whole secret tunnel down here.
[09:13.27]I did not know about the secret tunnel.
[09:14.97]Maybe this is how David Bowie keeps getting behind people.
[09:17.28]Shut up about the frickin' I don't care.
[09:18.88]I want to teach you how to use the website.
[09:20.72]You go to www... Fuck.
[09:22.58]I fucked it up.
[09:24.52]Okay, okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[09:28.68]I can't go scout?
[09:30.76]If you go to www, www, www, I have to go to www, www, www, www.
[09:34.86]I got scout, I got it, I'm the winner, I win the game.
[09:37.64]You won?
[09:37.82]Game over, game over, everybody.
[09:40.86]I'd like to see you at, uh, frickin' BlizzardCraft next year, BlizzardCon.
[09:45.00]You're going to BlizzardCraft?
[09:46.75]I just got sniped.
[09:48.29]Are you seriously going to BlizzardCraft next year?
[09:51.15]Yes.
[09:53.19]Yeah, it's awesome.
[09:54.23]You know what they're showcasing, right?
[09:56.48]Warcraft Heart of the Swarm?
[09:59.00]Yeah, it's a combo RTS hybrid base building shoot-em-up RPG, RARPG, DARPG.
[10:07.73]What is a RARPG?
[10:09.21]Is that like something that you extract forever and you pretend you're extracting it?
[10:13.87]Yeah, it's a .rar RPG.
[10:15.85]You pretend that you're extracting the file.
[10:19.45]Can I live for, like, more than one second so I can make a fucking video?
[10:22.15]No, no, this server is hard.
[10:23.19]Don't make the effing video either, please.
[10:26.77]What's the effing video?
[10:28.97]That's the one with swears in it, don't make that.
[10:30.55]Oh, look at the troll face.
[10:32.97]You got trolled.
[10:35.36]I'm going to troll you.
[10:38.36]Wait a minute, who's the... Is this the troll?
[10:42.10]Did you just play the troll?
[10:43.72]What?
[10:43.98]No, what?
[10:44.16]And why do I keep teleporting?
[10:49.75]Hey, Star, where are you?
[10:50.93]I just died, I just respawned, what do you want?
[10:52.71]Alright, come back.
[10:53.53]No, I saw the troll.
[10:54.41]No, no, no, you messed up the joke!
[10:55.97]No, shut up!
[10:57.15]I heard the joke, everyone heard it.
[10:59.63]No, no, no, we were gonna do it again, and it was gonna be funny that time, but... You didn't understand.
[11:12.98]Shit.
[11:14.70]Damn it.
[11:15.04]Oh my god.
[11:16.26]Oh my god, I'm so bad.
[11:20.16]Why am I so bad?
[11:22.37]You know what, just... Fuck!
[11:28.75]Taking the fucking Loose Cannon off.
[11:30.87]I'm gonna stick it up my ass.
[11:32.13]Let's change it, please.
[11:34.13]Please don't.
[11:36.57]I want someone to spray the troll picture again, because we can do the, oh, you got trolled.
[11:41.25]No, Jerma, this is flowing like a ballet right now.
[11:44.39]Do you understand what that means?
[11:45.35]No, it's not!
[11:47.49]You are full...
[11:53.07]This is Star's epic comeback as a ballet dancer, and I want it to be the whole ballet.
[11:58.97]The whole ballet?
[12:01.49]Yes.
[12:02.67]Who wants to sit through an entire ballet?
[12:04.69]You.
[12:06.34]Nobody wants to sit through an entire ballet, okay?
[12:12.08]You.
[12:12.30]What do you mean, you?
[12:14.40]You.
[12:15.40]You know how long a ballet is?
[12:17.22]Three hours?
[12:18.10]Have you ever been to a ballet?
[12:20.38]Three hours?
[12:21.90]It's like at least two and a half.
[12:24.62]It's a whole ballet.
[12:25.26]I'm saying three hours.
[12:26.12]No, two and a half.
[12:26.94]Like, you really gotta undercut me?
[12:29.22]Yes, because that was incorrect.
[12:30.24]I'm trying to make a profit.
[12:32.73]Well, good luck.
[12:34.17]Because there's already been like 30 people that have made a ballet before you.
[12:38.41]Like, 30 good ones.
[12:39.57]What's yours gonna be about?
[12:41.63]Socks.
[12:43.21]You're gonna make a sock ballet.
[12:46.35]Yeah, what else are you gonna do a ballet about?
[12:48.11]Like, isn't ballet all about the socks?
[12:50.05]Like, that's where the money is right now?
[12:53.40]No, I don't think so.
[12:54.34]I think it's in, like, the dancing.
[12:59.70]Just shut up, alright?
[13:01.12]You don't even know.
[13:02.54]What?
[13:03.36]I got killed from across the map in two shots by the Revolver.
[13:07.91]Shotgun?
[13:08.37]Oh, the Revolver, yeah.
[13:09.31]Revolver does 140.
[13:10.01]It does, oh my god.
[13:13.33]144, actually, if we want to be precise.
[13:19.90]Mm-mm, mm-mm.
[13:23.54]Well, not the Revolver, the Enforcer, I mean.
[13:27.00]And the first shot of a Revolver is always 100% accurate.
[13:30.54]Fun facts.
[13:31.24]This is, uh, fun fact time.
[13:33.93]Now just keep dying, son.
[13:34.77]I mean, if you can't beat him, join him.
[13:35.95]He's gonna play a soldier with, like, the regular rocket launcher.
[13:40.37]Oh.
[13:41.25]You should use the Liberty Launcher.
[13:42.91]Cheater.
[13:44.47]Yeah, I really should, you're right.
[13:48.29]There would just be no reason not to.
[13:52.63]He just... I respect that.
[13:55.71]Ooh, I got buffed health.
[13:57.80]This is what I'm talking about here.
[13:59.28]This is how we pull in the big bucks.
[14:02.06]I think I spy on the right as a sniper.
[14:03.68]I'm scared about that guy.
[14:04.92]I'm playing very patiently here.
[14:06.74]This is all about the killstreak.
[14:08.16]I'm calling in my shoppers.
[14:10.15]The other kind of chopper.
[14:11.13]Like the helicopter version.
[14:13.43]Your shopper?
[14:14.41]Yes.
[14:14.69]What are you using?
[14:17.57]This is the original rocket launcher.
[14:20.19]It was designed by Mr. Quake himself.
[14:23.33]Mr. Quake, John Romero.
[14:25.01]Do you know who Mr. Quake is?
[14:26.22]John Romero?
[14:28.50]Did he make all those OV movies?
[14:31.06]Yeah, he did.
[14:32.70]I'm scared to go up there.
[14:33.58]No, did David Bowie seriously suck a fart out of my ass?
[14:36.56]Like, really?
[14:38.30]Do I just go up?
[14:39.08]Do I just not be a punk?
[14:40.62]No, I'm not going to not be a punk.
[14:44.41]I did it wrong.
[14:45.39]No, no, we're going to the secret tunnel.
[14:46.45]I forgot.
[14:46.83]This is what I wanted to play Scout for.
[14:52.14]Did you find what you were looking for?
[14:53.38]Yes.
[14:55.40]Hmm, you did, didn't you?
[14:58.14]Oh, my.
[14:59.04]Hmm, only seven kills, but now we remember the secret tunnels there.
[15:03.76]And I got the guy who had the frickin' sentry gun.
[15:05.50]He probably spent, like, his whole life building that.
[15:07.33]Oh, yeah, and there's RTD, which I forgot about.
[15:10.69]Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go into Crit Server and build sentries.
[15:13.85]Like, you shoot for crits, it's really kooky, and fu- Sentries.
[15:20.36]Star, are you mad?
[15:21.54]Part 1.
[15:21.98]I'm not mad, I'm just thinking about the logistics.
[15:25.70]Alright, what am I clicking?
[15:26.48]What am I clicking?
[15:27.08]What am I clicking?
[15:29.15]I did super for it.
[15:30.01]I have no idea what the hell it is.
[15:31.15]I just clicked it.
[15:32.59]Because you know what?
[15:33.51]I think I only know what simple orange is.
[15:36.87]Oh, David Bowie!
[15:37.91]You got hit by that rocket, bro!
[15:40.07]You alright, David?
[15:43.02]Hey, you okay there, bro?
[15:44.70]Secret tunnel.
[15:45.74]We just gotta get to the secret tunnel.
[15:49.12]Okay, does this negate crits?
[15:51.04]I'm very curious to see if this happens.
[15:53.14]Does it work in this server?
[15:54.10]Yes, it does.
[15:55.60]Alright, well then...
[15:57.71]Let me just, like, kill myself by falling first.
[16:02.65]Ooh, you walked into it.
[16:03.77]He's too good.
[16:04.57]He's just... We're going.
[16:06.15]This is it.
[16:06.94]This is your moment.
[16:08.00]This is LeBron James 3.0.
[16:13.92]I'm putting on the family business and I'm just gonna be a shotgun asshole.
[16:17.06]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[16:18.85]Okay, that's probably not gonna go very well.
[16:20.67]You feel me?

[19:08.04]That's cool.
[19:09.55]That's really, really cool.
[19:10.43]Why did it say I had six kills and then it said I had five in the text?

[19:20.90]Scout?
[19:21.52]No, like he has glasses on.
[19:23.96]He's dead in one second because there's a sentry getting built right next to him.
[19:28.26]No, he has glasses on.
[19:29.30]He'll see it.
[19:31.15]See, he told you.
[19:31.53]He's about to die.

[19:33.94]He's going to capture the point.
[19:36.48]He can't do it.
[19:37.34]The engineer's going to come up and shoot him once.
[19:38.68]He's got glasses on.
[19:43.07]That's a lifeguard.
[19:43.89]I'm just waiting for it to be over.
[19:44.91]He's got glasses on.
[19:46.63]That's why he's going to survive.
