[00:37.76]Beer.
[01:46.91]Hey, guys, give me one second.
[01:48.51]It's starting a little early today.
[01:49.83]We're making sure we're not going to be late.
[01:52.55]So, I'm just going to get my phone and do some things.
[01:56.08]I'll be right back.
[01:57.32]Just enjoy the new emote, by the way, that's coming.
[02:00.48]jermaMars is on the way.
[02:02.64]I don't know.
[02:02.98]It's pending right now.
[02:03.82]So, if it happens during the stream, then it happens.
[02:06.68]But I'll see you guys in, like, a couple minutes.
[02:08.82]Be right back.
[05:12.75]Wait, I'm looping this thing?
[05:14.27]No, I'm not.
[05:15.61]I'm physically clicking it, so it starts over again.
[05:18.47]Because I suck.
[05:19.17]Alright, let me get to the game.
[05:21.25]Hold on.
[05:22.85]One second.
[05:35.36]What?
[05:38.68]pre-recorded no unfortunately unfortunately this is not a pre-recorded stream if it was if this is a pre-recorded stream you would know because I'd say something like this like here's how you can tell if it's pre-recorded like I'm gonna read the chat right now I'm gonna like react to it whoa the fuck
[05:59.80]Hey, now!
[06:01.56]See, like, I would never be able to do that if this was a, if this was not, you know, if this was a pre-recorded stream.
[06:05.34]It's a live stream.
[06:06.56]I would never be able to do that, if that was the case, you know?
[06:10.36]What'd you say, dude?
[06:11.56]Whoa!
[06:13.74]Alright, so, you're probably noticing, on the lower left of your screen, you're probably seeing the fact that I have 11 flasks and plus 9.
[06:24.41]For, then, we didn't even, I didn't even start my fucking sentence.
[06:29.72]I didn't even start my sentences and already Spoichem just gave pre-recorded bits.
[06:34.61]He gave a hundred bucks.
[06:35.93]The stream just turned on to the video game.
[06:40.05]That's very kind of you, dude.
[06:42.67]You're back with a vengeance.
[06:44.15]I'm looking at my other screen here and that animation is just freaking me the fuck out.
[06:47.93]Is it working?
[06:48.77]Oh yeah, it is.
[06:49.23]Good.
[06:50.31]I still have to resize that and add audio to it, but I'm a lazy pile of shit.
[06:55.78]Thank you so much, Spoichem.
[06:57.60]Am I saying your name right, by the way?
[07:00.78]Thank you for those pre-recorded bits.
[07:02.96]These aren't even real bits.
[07:03.96]They're pre-recorded.
[07:06.15]Thank you, though.
[07:07.35]Am I saying your name right?
[07:09.75]I hope I am.
[07:13.69]That's very, very much appreciated.
[07:17.57]Anyways... After we got a massive hundred dollars... After we got...
[07:25.88]Okay.
[07:26.98]Well, I can already see another one coming.
[07:29.24]And did it not happen?
[07:30.14]Did the fucking BS stampede not happen?
[07:36.22]That's 200 bucks.
[07:41.56]Can I please travel to a bonfire before we give any money?
[07:44.98]Let me get to a bonfire.
[07:46.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:47.38]Where is it?
[07:47.70]Demon Prince, here it is.
[07:50.14]Alright, I just traveled.
[07:51.14]I just fast traveled.
[07:56.35]Thank you for that lucky strike.
[07:57.93]316.
[07:57.95]Holy shit, dude.
[08:00.91]And he says, beat me to it.
[08:03.49]You guys both were about to do that, apparently.
[08:06.33]But you're both fucking legends.
[08:07.87]Thank you.
[08:09.61]Thank you for the $100 each.
[08:15.23]Much appreciated.
[08:18.21]Jeremy just woke up, got to his computer, and made $200.
[08:20.27]Dude, that's why I always, like, feel, like, so bad.
[08:23.43]Like, okay, like, I'm just like, hold on a minute.
[08:25.05]We're timing it.
[08:26.43]Oh.
[08:29.23]My, like, butthole hurts.
[08:31.03]Hey, I'm just, like, rolling out of bed.
[08:32.70]What time's 7 o'clock, 7.15, late streamer?
[08:36.18]Oh, an extra 200 bucks.
[08:37.96]I always feel so, like, I need to do something first.
[08:40.96]Let me do, like, first, like, just get this.
[08:42.72]Ready?
[08:45.69]Okay, now I don't feel so bad.
[08:48.89]And then let me touch your bum.
[08:50.21]We're talking about our bums.
[08:51.11]Thank you for the $1,500.
[08:52.83]I don't have $100, but I can give $15.
[08:54.49]Don't worry.
[08:56.30]You don't have to give me $100.
[08:59.90]Every time I get $100, it's crazy.
[09:02.50]Don't feel like you have to give $100.
[09:03.66]Why does my butthole hurt?
[09:06.92]Do you really need me to tell you that?
[09:08.90]You guys should know that by now.
[09:12.12]Now dance for us, clown.
[09:16.78]Alright.
[09:17.44]Did I not... Do this yet?
[09:22.92]Money stream.
[09:24.40]I already did this.
[09:25.66]I guess I... Okay, I didn't do that yet.
[09:29.11]Okay, I remember.
[09:29.65]I kind of did this for a second.
[09:31.13]I guess we'll do it again.
[09:33.01]Yeah, sub only mode is prevent spoilers.
[09:35.09]Because I don't want to look over at the chat and see... Wait a minute.
[09:39.67]Did I rage quit this part?
[09:42.01]Hold on.
[09:43.01]I didn't... I got down there, didn't I?
[09:48.34]This is the part with the arrows.
[09:54.44]Ah, this is the bonfire right here.
[09:55.80]I guess I got sick of this shit?
[10:00.26]Well, let's just sit here.
[10:04.73]Unfortunately, we have to deal with this bullshit again, but whatever.
[10:09.68]I'm two bonfires behind.
[10:10.92]Am I?
[10:11.04]No, I'm not.
[10:12.00]I'll say that.
[10:17.18]Bring... Okay, there it is.
[10:18.10]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:18.72]Okay.
[10:20.05]I did get to the next bonfire.
[10:21.07]That's right.
[10:21.93]I got way past this.
[10:22.79]I was curious.
[10:23.45]I was like, no way.
[10:23.93]Is this going to be another rage stream?
[10:26.69]Yes.
[10:27.61]Absolutely.
[10:28.65]Look, I'm going to put this forward for you guys right now.
[10:32.98]The stream has been live for ten minutes.
[10:36.49]There's going to be a couple of swear words.
[10:37.81]I'm going to say by 40 minutes I will have cursed out the game's developers.
[10:42.31]So we'll see how long.
[10:43.13]You know what?
[10:44.03]No.
[10:44.39]Fuck that.
[10:45.89]Let's see how long we can go.
[10:47.55]Without saying anything bad.
[10:48.82]Like complaining about the game.
[10:49.96]Or complaining about... You know, anything.
[10:54.12]No complaints in particular at all.
[10:55.48]How long do you think I can go?
[10:58.76]I bet you I can go for at least 30 minutes.
[11:00.94]Start the timer right now.
[11:05.48]Yeah, you thought you were going to get a complaint out of me right there, didn't you?
[11:09.04]Not quite.
[11:10.56]Not yet.
[11:15.30]Not in this lifetime.
[11:23.41]Oh my god, somebody just gave him another $100.
[11:26.85]Full ragey.
[11:28.73]Full ragery for 30 minutes.
[11:30.93]Says Dedo99.
[11:32.57]Dedo99IE.
[11:37.28]Dead?
[11:37.70]Dedo.
[11:38.09]I just keep calling you Dedo.
[11:39.75]And that's what I'm gonna call you.
[11:40.55]But thank you for the hundred bucks, man.
[11:42.87]That shit is... That shit is fucking crazy.
[11:46.77]Fucking hundred dollars.
[11:50.22]Well, now I have to adhere to what he says.
[11:52.48]I have to not be any... I can't be mad.
[11:54.46]I have to slow myself down.
[11:56.74]Not get any anger coming out of my mouth, you know.
[11:59.53]My mouth cavity has to be closed with all anger.
[12:02.09]And we're gonna fight this guy...
[12:05.34]Perfect dodge, she asked me.
[12:08.36]Not a perfect dodge.
[12:09.92]Not even gonna get hit once.
[12:11.51]Perfect.
[12:15.69]Well, I got hit right there, but it's okay.
[12:17.27]You guys actually aren't even that bad.
[12:23.10]I got really greedy there.
[12:23.96]Let's see how much this heals now.
[12:26.24]That's way better, way better.
[12:29.72]Oh, I died.
[12:30.88]Well, the reason why I died there is because I wanted to, like, see how much health this healed now, because I got two both.
[12:36.94]This guy is so... Hey, easy!
[12:39.84]Easy.
[12:41.70]Easy.
[12:43.44]Pulled the brains back.
[12:45.48]Having a great time so far.
[12:52.75]My framerate... My framerate dropped a little.
[12:58.07]That's not a complaint, that's a fact.
[12:59.47]My framerate dropped a little, that's not a complaint.
[13:07.33]Somebody just gave me a hundred fucking dollars.
[13:14.16]Dude, Lucky Strike 316 gives another hundred bucks.
[13:16.76]Get the swear jar ready.
[13:21.14]You wanna get like a swear jar?
[13:24.16]Alright, I'm gonna put a silver dollar every time I say the F word.
[13:29.94]Not even six minutes.
[13:30.58]That wasn't a complaint, that was a fact.
[13:34.20]These stu- These- Okay, the floor- Shut up.
[13:39.51]No complaints.
[13:42.73]I can, like, parry this guy.
[13:44.05]What the hell am I thinking?
[13:59.12]I really should parry him.
[14:03.52]There's no reason not to parry him.
[14:06.18]But I don't even have to parry shield on.
[14:08.08]I don't know why I'm not using the Burgah Boy technique.
[14:16.58]I should have been using it the whole time.
[14:17.68]Yeah, that guy was actually way harder than he should have been.
[14:32.11]Really lucky strike.
[14:34.75]That's a lot of money, dude.
[14:37.61]Hopefully you're enjoying the stream.
[14:38.70]But what I was gonna say is that we're just gonna talk straight up facts.
[14:42.26]I'm not gonna... There's no complaints here.
[14:44.52]I'm gonna give you guys a fact.
[14:48.34]These flowers?
[14:49.88]Dropping my frame rate a little bit.
[14:52.05]That's not a complaint.
[14:52.75]That is a fact of the stream and a fact of the video game.
[14:57.77]Okay, good.
[15:02.24]$400 burger stream.
[15:08.44]He almost complained twice.
[15:09.84]No, no he didn't.
[15:17.38]Did somebody just say alternative complaints?
[15:21.72]Okay, that's kind of funny.
[15:24.65]That's funny in a lot of different ways.
[15:29.85]Hey, we're talking political humor!
[15:34.57]This place looks pretty?
[15:35.25]It does.
[15:35.53]I don't know what these guys do.
[15:43.41]Ow, okay.
[15:44.59]He puts a ring on you and it hurts.
[15:52.08]I can't hurt him.
[15:53.16]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[15:56.33]These enemies are really strange.
[16:05.63]Can't even give him like a second to do that.
[16:11.10]Who else is doing that?
[16:12.66]Is there another one there?
[16:16.26]Okay, well that's that.
[16:20.26]These guys give a lot of souls.
[16:23.47]He liked it, so he put a ring on it.
[16:26.63]I did, okay, try jumping.
[16:27.77]Good.
[16:29.55]I tried to jump.
[16:32.03]Come on, really?
[16:36.23]I tried jumping.
[16:39.57]I really needed to kill that thing.
[16:40.71]I just, like, fell down.
[16:41.59]Through walls now.
[16:46.65]No, I ain't fighting this guy yet.
[16:48.35]I gotta clear out all these random idiots up here.
[16:52.55]These Ninja Turtles can get annoying.
[17:01.36]Complaint?
[17:03.10]Wait, that was a complaint?
[17:07.20]Did I complain?
[17:08.50]I did, didn't I?
[17:10.12]I did.
[17:12.30]Yep.
[17:13.40]I complained.
[17:15.00]That's it.
[17:15.38]How long have I been streaming?
[17:16.76]It took seven minutes.
[17:19.78]What did I say?
[17:20.24]I was gonna go for 30 minutes?
[17:23.26]Well, I tried.
[17:25.74]I tried to not complain.
[17:27.08]15 minutes.
[17:33.79]At least I got it somewhere.
[17:35.89]I was somewhat correct.
[17:39.51]It only took 7 minutes.
[17:54.24]So I gotta get in a safe spot.
[17:56.14]I gotta be very safe right now.
[18:16.65]So he's almost complained at 5.57.
[18:17.53]We already did complain.
[18:21.19]We already figured it out.
[18:33.05]This guy has a spear.
[18:34.64]That means he's way worse than the other one.
[18:37.06]He's way worse.
[18:41.58]I just hate the reach of the spear.
[18:43.20]I'm already down to three Estus Blasters.
[18:45.22]And I'm dead.
[18:54.16]Here's something funny about Dark Souls.
[18:56.57]Spears are fucking terrible.
[18:59.16]Spears are so fucking awful.
[19:01.90]And, like, the guys that have spears in the game, like, the non-playable characters are always the best fucking, like, most ridiculous... Oh, we're doing a swear jar.
[19:10.42]She's just, like, dropping coins in this thing.
[19:16.30]Hey, that's not a complaint.
[19:18.26]Those are facts.
[19:23.20]Everybody uses spears in this game, and they're always fantastic.
[19:29.22]If I use a spear, spears are like the worst weapons in Dark Souls.
[19:33.54]That's not fair.
[19:34.10]Don't worry, it gets so much more fun later.
[19:44.55]I can't wait.
[19:55.08]No, not this guy.
[19:56.48]I really need to pull out the parry shield.
[19:57.78]I'm just doing this, though.
[20:01.39]No favors.
[20:03.85]That's what you gotta do.
[20:11.63]This guy's not so... He should have died right there.
[20:18.26]Lightning spear and Dark Souls won.
[20:19.52]Yeah, the lightning was cool until they patched it.
[20:23.90]Not a complaint.
[20:27.40]I'm not complaining about that.
[20:32.77]Yeah, that person's dead if you do that.
[20:36.77]There's no way I lived through that one.
[20:43.07]Swear jar droke.
[20:44.77]Swear jar droke.
[20:47.57]Let's wait till I get a rain shell.
[20:50.05]I can't wait.
[20:54.52]Although the Burgah Boy technique really does work very, very well on these enemies.
[20:57.94]You just have to keep doing it.
[20:58.76]I don't think Jirmba will ever be able to beat the last boss.
[21:08.63]Probably not.
[21:10.13]I had a lot of trouble with Freed.
[21:11.99]To the point where I just gave the fuck up and three people came around to save me.
[21:29.17]Ow.
[21:31.81]Stop praying.
[21:38.67]Freed.
[21:39.19]Sister freed.
[21:40.43]After the second phase, it was just kind of... Alright, give me a second.
[21:44.39]Put the parry shield back on.
[21:45.64]It looks like a fire resist shield.
[21:49.10]There we go.
[21:51.60]Now I'm ready.
[21:52.92]I'm not quite ready, but I'm going to pretend to be ready.
[21:57.92]I wasn't ready.
[22:05.10]I did not expect that at all.
[22:08.39]I'm shocked.
[22:09.63]I'm shocked.
[22:14.25]Why do I keep doing that?
[22:15.79]I don't even need to fucking do that.
[22:19.81]That's so... I don't even need to do that.
[22:21.41]There's a staircase right here.
[22:33.06]I am too, I'm sucked.
[22:36.20]Okay, the guy dropping the stupid ring, like, Final Fantasy move on me.
[22:46.24]Yeah, good.
[22:46.94]Cool.
[22:47.56]Nice summon.
[22:49.06]Would you learn that, bro?
[22:57.91]What?
[23:00.79]What?
[23:00.99]How did you not take any damage from that?
[23:04.91]Ooh, this guy is giving me so much anger.
[23:09.01]I just don't know.
[23:09.69]I don't know where he is.
[23:12.41]Quagmire ahead.
[23:13.51]Wait, so, like, Family Guy's Quagmire is going to jump down?
[23:18.95]That was not even a joke.
[23:19.72]That was terrible.
[23:21.34]I'm sorry.
[23:21.84]Somebody's going to give him $100 again.
[23:24.26]Very good boy.
[23:25.26]Come on.
[23:25.68]Very good boy.
[23:30.96]Jeez.
[23:33.86]Jeez.
[23:38.90]Okay, you know when you have an alarm set and you don't touch the alarm?
[23:42.60]And you sleep through it?
[23:44.26]That's what this is right now for me.
[23:47.01]I need to turn this alarm off.
[23:52.01]Where is he?
[23:58.06]Can I please hit the snooze button?
[24:00.82]Okay, let me get to a safe place so I can see what just happened.
[24:03.52]Did somebody just give some money?
[24:04.48]It's still happening.
[24:05.96]Where is this guy?
[24:09.04]Stop it, please!
[24:11.16]Where does he go?
[24:13.55]Where does he come from?
[24:15.45]Princess ahead.
[24:16.55]Saint ahead.
[24:17.19]I'm not doing that yet.
[24:17.99]Are you kidding me?
[24:19.51]That's a boss.
[24:21.05]We aren't doing a boss.
[24:21.61]We're getting a shortcut first.
[24:22.77]And now here's two of these huge guys.
[24:27.44]God.
[24:36.58]Oh dear.
[24:38.30]Son of a... What's down here?
[24:45.76]There's like a CHUNK!
[24:47.55]CHUNK!
[24:48.53]Speaking of chunks... Speaking of chunks, there's a big chunk here.
[24:52.09]Somebody died back there.
[24:53.91]Oh, it was you.
[24:55.51]And there's lightning bolts now.
[24:58.41]I don't know where to go.
[24:59.09]Hold on.
[24:59.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[25:01.99]Wait.
[25:04.42]Just pick up the items.
[25:05.62]Moss fruit.
[25:06.36]Nice.
[25:09.30]I ain't doing that shit right now.
[25:10.42]That is another one of these guys.
[25:11.66]I am so, so, so, so terrified of this.
[25:16.92]What's up here?
[25:21.88]And now, if one of them comes over here, I'll be able to deal with it.
[25:26.41]Invade.
[25:28.69]Oh, yeah?
[25:29.57]Oh, invaded, huh?
[25:31.37]Where is it?
[25:33.05]Get the fuck out of here!
[25:37.21]What do you mean there's no one to send home?
[25:44.09]Send him home.
[25:45.39]Send this guy home.
[25:51.11]Why can't I send him home?
[25:54.08]Go home!
[25:57.50]Oh, it's an NPC.
[25:58.04]Okay.
[26:03.64]Can't stagger him.
[26:08.10]Of course.
[26:11.66]I'm, like, dead here.
[26:14.56]No, I'm not.
[26:15.04]Not quite.
[26:15.44]Yeah, I am.
[26:20.74]Just run for it.
[26:24.68]What?
[26:25.02]We were just playing Ring Around the Rosie and he caught me.
[26:32.50]Ugh.
[26:34.07]He was waiting for me.
[26:35.09]You tell me that wasn't a player?
[26:36.07]That guy played better than a player.
[26:40.62]He played better than a player.
[26:41.88]Oh, whatever.
[26:48.68]This place.
[26:50.22]This place is going to be fun.
[26:53.44]You know, just restart the whole thing.
[26:55.42]I got hit way too many times.
[26:58.86]Can't send that phantom home.
[27:01.12]Alright, first of all.
[27:02.99]Tommy tough nuts gave a hundred dollars a few minutes ago It says hey Jerma been a fan for a while and your funny YouTube bids made a year-long development a Lot easier.
[27:13.68]Thanks and keep it up.
[27:16.06]Oh Did veer long deployment I can't my brain was like a fried egg dude.
[27:20.46]I'm sorry a year-long deployment made life a lot easier well I'm glad you enjoyed the videos.
[27:27.49]Yeah, I
[27:29.41]Because that's what I like to do.
[27:31.72]And there'll be more.
[27:32.58]Don't worry.
[27:33.90]Stay tuned.
[27:35.44]But, Tommy, much love to you.
[27:38.58]Development.
[27:39.28]I don't know why I read that as development.
[27:45.97]This guy's going to get me, seriously, every single time, by the way.
[27:50.81]I will get hit by that guy probably every time.
[27:57.40]I have a lot of souls.
[27:58.39]I need to get those souls, go back and level up.
[28:00.63]I hate that I don't have that one little hit at the end.
[28:07.65]He's infuriating.
[28:20.30]I've been in development for eight years.
[28:23.30]We've all been in development.
[28:26.83]I just barely, like, developed as a man.
[28:29.39]You know what I mean?
[28:30.85]Like, I'm 30.
[28:31.97]I'm 41.
[28:33.25]And I just hit puberty, like, a year ago.
[28:35.07]Like, two years ago.
[28:41.76]I need that backstab.
[28:45.94]Okay.
[28:53.13]I love the R2 charge in these Souls games.
[28:58.09]But it never feels worth doing.
[28:59.48]I feel like it doesn't do any damage.
[29:03.04]Or it doesn't do enough to justify standing still for a full two seconds.
[29:06.62]Standing still for two seconds in Dark Souls pretty much is just, hey, somebody please kill me.
[29:11.49]I'm just asking somebody to do it at that point.
[29:23.56]R2s are worthless in Dark Souls 3.
[29:24.84]Yeah.
[29:25.02]They kind of are, aren't they?
[29:30.28]Alright.
[29:37.51]This time, no... I might just run by this way.
[29:43.11]I just don't know where to go after this.
[29:45.42]Have I gone out there?
[29:49.22]Ultra greatswords have great charge R2s.
[29:52.30]Do they though?
[29:54.59]Do they actually?
[29:55.25]I'm just gonna run down.
[30:01.81]I'm not gonna even fight this guy.
[30:03.09]It's a waste of time.
[30:03.83]We're just sprinting by everything.
[30:07.23]I want to get those souls back.
[30:11.79]Which, where was it?
[30:12.93]I don't even remember.
[30:13.81]That's like a boss.
[30:16.33]This is where the princess is, and I'm not even sure I can open this door.
[30:18.89]I'm gonna try.
[30:19.79]No, I guess I'm talking.
[30:23.37]Speak thee the name of God.
[30:25.36]Okay.
[30:25.66]The name of my God?
[30:26.44]Come on, Gwen!
[30:27.62]Come on, Gwen!
[30:37.21]Servant to the Princess of Filinore.
[30:40.76]Yeah.
[30:42.60]What else do you have to tell me?
[30:43.56]Please keep going on.
[30:45.18]Why do I hear loud noises?
[30:50.10]What?!
[30:51.92]Why are you here?!
[30:53.74]Please!
[30:57.68]She's still talking!
[31:01.51]What the fuck, man?! !
[31:07.71]Why?
[31:11.61]I started to hear the footsteps.
[31:12.67]I didn't think this guy's pathing came all the way to the door.
[31:14.96]Like, why would it come all the way to the door?
[31:22.62]You know what I mean?
[31:23.66]Come on, Gwen!
[31:27.69]Alright, at least I can get rid of one of these guys.
[31:35.63]No, maybe not.
[31:36.15]I'm just gonna die.
[31:37.55]Don't say that.
[31:38.21]Have confidence, at least, for once.
[31:44.96]It's quite rude of them.
[31:45.82]Okay, now, what do you have to say, Princess Fiona?
[31:49.80]Okay, I have to say this again.
[31:53.36]Okay, it's gonna be Gwen.
[31:55.99]Ah, then thou hast not forgotten.
[31:57.01]Yeah.
[32:01.67]Servant to the princess Filianore, matriarch, they who are akin to God's name are surely akin to the terrors of the dark.
[32:09.79]Please, I bid thee take not from the princess her peace.
[32:14.68]It's not happening again.
[32:15.58]He's gone.
[32:16.20]As the fire waneth, does she lie by the dark?
[32:19.84]Here he comes.
[32:20.56]Here comes another one.
[32:21.34]I would have fucking cried.
[32:22.60]Thou still can't speak to a captive such as me.
[32:29.12]Hey, I only swore one time there.
[32:31.19]That was one swear.
[32:34.05]Was that swear worth like three coins?
[32:35.57]Oh, okay.
[32:40.60]That would have been a funny moment.
[32:44.32]That would have been a funny moment.
[32:45.94]If another one came.
[32:47.38]I don't even know what this is.
[32:50.24]Alright, somebody spoiled this.
[32:51.44]Should I accept this?
[32:52.30]What's like the good ending?
[32:57.25]What's this?
[32:58.27]Should I accept?
[32:58.97]Is she going to open the door?
[32:59.97]Refuse?
[33:01.35]Refuse puts me probably in a bad spot.
[33:04.33]I hear the footsteps again, but I don't want to see the dialog again.
[33:07.58]So, I'm accepting.
[33:08.76]Okay.
[33:09.20]Sacred Chime of Filinore.
[33:12.32]That's not her name!
[33:22.92]Her name's not Filinore.
[33:25.40]Great dragon, put him to rest.
[33:29.90]Alright, what the hell is this thing?
[33:35.30]This is just a chime.
[33:36.22]I don't even use these things.
[33:38.72]Okay.
[33:40.36]Well, at least I got rid of one of the big guys that frees up some scariness here.
[33:46.90]Let me just peek over here.
[33:48.22]Give it a little peek, you know.
[33:54.04]Dude E Burger on the ground there.
[33:55.44]That's Dude E Burger.
[33:58.24]Dude E Burger.
[34:00.10]I need to name my next Dark Souls character.
[34:01.90]Dude, space, E period.
[34:06.57]Space Burger.
[34:08.99]Who is shooting the lightning, that guy?
[34:13.73]So should I be thinking, can I do something about this bird's nest?
[34:16.37]That's sitting on the guy's stomach.
[34:20.85]I feel like I can.
[34:22.25]Just three times.
[34:24.35]That guy sat on me.
[34:37.02]That guy just gave me the... Yeah, thanks for the Yokozuna.
[34:39.79]Where am I?
[34:50.83]I wish these guys didn't have so much health.
[34:52.63]Not a complaint, by the way.
[34:53.79]I'm just stating what I think.
[34:55.39]I guess that is a complaint.
[35:05.84]I can't see.
[35:09.62]Don't!
[35:10.40]I'm stuck here again.
[35:14.56]man get please just why did I get stuck in the same doorway why did that happen why did I get stuck in the same doorway I lost 47 fucking thousand souls you know just grab a fucking handful of coins and just throw them all in there just dump them in there fucking dump them I'm gonna drink this
[35:46.39]Are we live here?
[35:47.75]Can you guys hear me?
[35:52.31]Are we here?
[35:56.35]That was weird.
[36:01.95]No internet issues down here.
[36:04.91]I'm looking at straight zero drop frames.
[36:07.81]I'm in the green.
[36:09.57]My upstream is perfect right now.
[36:12.87]Maybe it was that ingest server.
[36:14.21]Maybe something was going on.
[36:16.98]I don't know.
[36:18.42]But in that whole process, I died, and I lost all my souls.
[36:24.55]Who's talking?
[36:25.93]Who's that?
[36:26.27]Is that me?
[36:27.51]I'm looking at the straight zero drop.
[36:29.13]I'm going to try to talk.
[36:29.69]I'm going to keep this on.
[36:30.97]Okay, I've got to remember what I said, because I'm going to try to repeat it at the same time.
[36:35.63]Maybe something went wrong.
[36:38.35]I don't know.
[36:39.79]But in that process, I died, and I lost all my souls.
[36:46.97]Talking?
[36:47.61]Is that me?
[36:49.64]I'm going to try to talk at the same time.
[36:52.94]Hold on, give me this.
[36:54.16]I'm going to talk to our members at the same time.
[36:56.74]Something to do with something.
[36:59.71]I don't know.
[37:01.19]But it's next to the process.
[37:03.63]I think that lost all my souls.
[37:07.40]And I'm gonna have to stop turn off from me talking I'm gonna try talking the same look at this Yes, you can have your phone back I'm tripping balls right now That's very hard to do to remember what you've said I
[37:35.28]This is terrible.
[37:36.26]I love it.
[37:38.16]Well, now I'm mad because... I, uh... I lost like 50,000 souls.
[37:47.22]Everyone was saying the stream died.
[37:48.35]I'm looking over.
[37:48.87]I'm like, what happened?
[37:50.21]I got killed by the guy with the giant sword.
[37:54.33]We've done this joke before?
[37:55.25]No, we haven't.
[37:58.07]We did the clip it joke.
[37:59.05]That was that I'm trying to talk at the same time and say the same words that I was saying.
[38:07.26]Okay, let's take this slow.
[38:10.90]Please, come on.
[38:12.44]Okay, I got 3,000 souls.
[38:13.82]I'm so happy about that.
[38:14.84]Let me try to parry this guy.
[38:21.45]That looked pretty good to me.
[38:22.59]I'm not gonna lie.
[38:23.99]That looked really good to me.
[38:26.37]Why could I not parry that?
[38:30.21]That looked really good.
[38:32.11]Looks perfect.
[38:46.33]I can parry with the weapon art?
[38:47.33]Yeah, but it's hard to do.
[38:49.23]And if you don't get it, you're just sitting there like a sitting duck.
[38:51.77]How did that not hurt me?
[39:01.46]I'm getting chased, right?
[39:02.32]There's one dumb guy in a... Better not be any other people.
[39:16.29]I'm not even sure why I'm trying to do that.
[39:17.83]Let me just kill him.
[39:22.55]No.
[39:23.15]Let me just run by him.
[39:25.05]There's no reason to fight this guy.
[39:26.25]There's no reason to fight any of these people.
[39:29.22]They're all so obnoxious, and I don't even need to fight them.
[39:32.32]Just go by them.
[39:41.49]Like, they put these obnoxious enemies in the game that you don't even have to fight.
[39:45.23]They're just there.
[39:46.37]They're just there.
[39:51.72]Yeah, like this guy.
[39:52.50]He's just here.
[39:54.14]Bye.
[39:55.58]It was nice knowing you.
[40:03.17]Alright, should I go this way?
[40:13.78]Alright, I will get rid of the lightning people because they're annoying.
[40:15.82]As long as he's not staggering.
[40:22.41]Alright.
[40:26.85]I want to go that way.
[40:28.71]But I don't... I'm gonna... Let's take a look.
[40:35.90]I can hear him.
[40:36.36]He's like right here.
[40:40.54]Leave me alone.
[40:42.26]I'll fight this guy, because I just don't know the area here, so let's just fight this dude.
[40:46.96]Try to win.
[40:52.36]Why does that guy have the Pontiff Sullivan moveset?
[40:55.09]Like, that... That is so unfair.
[40:59.65]That shit is like... How are you supposed to fight this guy?
[41:03.05]When he puts a sword up, do you just not even go near him?
[41:06.25]He swings like seven fucking times.
[41:10.67]That guy just swung like seven times in three seconds.
[41:12.94]Like, what the fuck?
[41:19.22]God.
[41:22.74]You know, these are worse than those Pontiff enemies.
[41:25.78]Those Pontiff enemies right before Sullivan are like some of the worst enemies I've ever fought in a game.
[41:31.10]And these guys are like getting close to being like even close to being that obnoxious.
[41:45.43]I don't even want to fight those guys.
[41:47.21]They're just not fun to fight.
[41:50.09]It's not fun to fight an enemy that goes like this.
[41:56.18]It's not fun.
[42:00.14]I have no health.
[42:01.34]How did that happen?
[42:15.85]I'm just going this way.
[42:16.70]These three guys.
[42:19.12]You're kidding me, game.
[42:20.26]This is like Scholar of the First Sin bullshit.
[42:27.08]Remember that?
[42:27.56]Remember when they just put a bunch of random enemies everywhere in Scholar of the First Sin?
[42:32.23]Remember how dumb that was?
[42:33.55]They did it again.
[42:36.17]What's happening?
[42:43.40]There's just so many of these people!
[42:46.02]Why are there a party of fat people down here?
[42:50.42]They're just like... I don't know what to do!
[42:53.00]I can't fight these guys!
[42:54.69]You can't fight this!
[43:01.75]You're giving me six huge people!
[43:08.48]They were not messing around.
[43:10.46]I told you they all went out and got shit-faced.
[43:13.45]They all drank so much alcohol.
[43:17.05]And the guy that was running the show at FromSoftware was just like, Who cares what's there?
[43:22.05]Just put a ton of random enemies.
[43:24.53]And I have like seven of those fat guys.
[43:26.55]Just put them all there.
[43:27.99]You know like the paint tool?
[43:30.06]They just used the paint tool and dragged it across the map and put the fat guy there.
[43:37.79]Yeah, nice FromSoftware, nice paint tool development you have here.
[43:46.15]Hey, can you click and let go instead of clicking and dragging?
[43:58.27]Code fat fuck.
[44:11.93]I love how I said I wasn't going to complain on this stream.
[44:15.23]And this is like, I have to not go that way, right?
[44:20.31]I need to avoid these guys.
[44:22.59]That's like the only feasible way.
[44:24.15]And now I'm like getting locked in here.
[44:30.00]Even going by them seems like it's going to be fairly difficult.
[44:32.60]Can I even make this?
[44:39.69]Woo!
[44:41.21]It's okay.
[44:41.65]Don't worry.
[44:41.99]There's just three more down here.
[44:43.11]I don't know what's over there, but we're not doing it.
[44:52.55]Souls retrieved.
[44:53.97]God.
[44:56.89]God, I can't fit through these two fat fucks.
[44:59.27]Nope.
[44:59.73]And there's no way I'm going by this.
[45:01.43]These are linebackers.
[45:03.05]I feel like I'm doing a QB sneak for a touchdown.
[45:07.26]I got the touchdown.
[45:08.68]I got the touchdown.
[45:11.08]It's okay.
[45:11.40]It's just bugs.
[45:12.82]It's just bugs.
[45:14.04]Did you hear that voice crack, by the way?
[45:16.52]I told you guys I was going through puberty.
[45:18.32]Who are you?
[45:24.20]I don't know where to go.
[45:24.84]Am I safe?
[45:26.95]I don't know if I'm safe.
[45:27.67]I need to calm down.
[45:29.57]Who is this giant person?
[45:32.41]Oh my god.
[45:33.09]Somebody's talking.
[45:40.22]Huh?
[45:42.04]No, you motherfucker.
[45:48.56]Not this again.
[45:49.32]Not this again, please.
[45:52.18]There's too much going on, there's too many things.
[45:55.58]There's bugs, there's fat guys, there's a whole football team.
[45:59.62]There's father time.
[46:01.91]I'm so confused.
[46:06.13]Thanks for the prism stones, Jason.
[46:08.61]Okay.
[46:09.85]Okay.
[46:13.57]Alright.
[46:17.98]Um... Easy game.
[46:22.46]Like, where's the challenge from, software?
[46:23.96]Come on.
[46:25.92]Take this slow.
[46:35.00]Nobody else find that strange that like these guys are actually talking?
[46:37.52]They're not like monsters?
[46:44.76]They take a lot of hits too.
[46:48.17]Jerma was hitting every booby trap in every Indiana Jones movie all at once.
[46:55.67]I was just like getting traps, triggered, running around in circles.
[47:01.42]Oh, that's funny.
[47:02.84]That's funny.
[47:05.43]Where do I go?
[47:06.09]I need to avoid him for now.
[47:15.86]What?
[47:17.06]Oh!
[47:21.74]And he's trying to go to the bathroom on me now.
[47:28.72]Somebody said it hurts knowing how close he is.
[47:31.14]It doesn't... Oh, no.
[47:32.56]That means I'm like... Wait, wait.
[47:34.16]Bonfire ahead.
[47:34.70]Where?
[47:36.96]Where is it?
[47:39.20]Dude, you can't put this here.
[47:40.44]You can't put this here and not... Put it in a different... Right here.
[47:48.18]This has got to be it, right?
[47:50.64]Bonfire?
[47:56.07]Oh, yes.
[47:58.74]My God.
[48:00.66]Here's the shortcut back to here.
[48:04.55]To put that, why would you put the bonfire message over there?
[48:10.55]Time for this place again.
[48:11.63]Yeah, let's get the, oh, doesn't that, what?
[48:15.51]Huh?
[48:19.43]Alright.
[48:21.26]So after that panic, we're back to normal.
[48:28.88]I just need to keep progressing.
[48:30.06]I feel like I'm getting close to the next boss.
[48:31.98]If I were to guess.
[48:35.20]Can I backstab these guys?
[48:36.49]I think so.
[48:39.61]Burgah Boy technique.
[48:45.87]Hey, it worked, didn't it?
[48:46.69]It did.
[48:48.65]You guys can, like, say whatever you want about, like, my technique getting here.
[48:52.94]But I got the touchdown.
[48:54.50]And that's all that matters.
[48:56.24]I shall not
[48:58.74]If I was stopped, that would have been fourth down.
[49:02.36]No, that would have been third down.
[49:03.70]So, no big deal.
[49:05.10]I would have been able to do that again before I would have to turn the controller over to someone else.
[49:10.92]Yeah, I would have to give the controller to Kim.
[49:14.52]I would turn over on downs.
[49:18.98]Breacher's right arm.
[49:20.92]What is that?
[49:23.39]Is that a weapon?
[49:25.43]I ain't even going to mess with this guy.
[49:26.85]For real.
[49:27.43]I'm just going to try to run.
[49:30.15]Here.
[49:30.59]Look at this.
[49:37.68]Look at this, guys.
[49:38.48]Look at this.
[49:39.54]Would you look at this?
[49:41.68]I want to make sure you guys are looking.
[49:43.02]There's three of these people.
[49:47.08]The archers are firing at me.
[49:53.94]Well, okay.
[49:54.66]There's apparently still safe to a degree.
[49:59.33]What's down there?
[50:00.13]Something.
[50:00.51]I don't even... I can't even stop to look.
[50:02.89]There's no stopping and looking here.
[50:15.54]I can go that way.
[50:18.92]I feel like that's where I have to go.
[50:23.59]It's not your fault for mindlessly running through.
[50:26.31]Well, I mean, when he's in the middle of expanding archa- I just need a place to sit and look.
[50:33.03]I just need to see for a second.
[50:36.78]I hear somebody!
[50:39.28]No, please!
[50:42.28]I like heard that guy creeping up on me at the last possible second.
[50:49.78]Get a backstab.
[50:51.32]Just kick him.
[50:51.92]Just get him out of here.
[50:53.50]Get him out of here.
[50:57.08]Please!
[51:03.65]Mistake!
[51:06.71]No, one of us is going to fall off the edge and it ain't going to be me.
[51:08.73]It's going to be you.
[51:11.29]No, he's going to do the psycho move.
[51:12.65]Nope, we ain't even going to have that life.
[51:15.51]We ain't even going to play that one.
[51:18.26]Why do I hear noise?
[51:19.50]That's a giant dragon!
[51:21.74]That's a giant dragon!
[51:23.50]No!
[51:24.88]No!
[51:41.20]Your face right now is priceless.
[51:47.71]And there's a giant dragon that just breathes fire on the bridge.
[51:51.63]Of course there is.
[51:52.25]Dude.
[51:56.97]I want to go to the party that they went to before making this DLC.
[52:06.86]I can't go over there, I guess?
[52:08.36]I don't know.
[52:09.32]I'm just so lost.
[52:10.32]I'm going this way.
[52:12.34]Rest in spaghetti.
[52:13.88]Never forgetty.
[52:14.82]What the fuck?
[52:16.58]I'm fucking dead again!
[52:26.91]I mean, I'm kind of permeating anger right now.
[52:32.45]Yeah, I just got breathed on by a fire-breathing dragon.
[52:42.23]No, over here.
[52:42.89]Look.
[52:43.81]They're fine.
[52:46.09]They're fine.
[52:47.43]They might be a little warm, but that doesn't mean that they're gross.
[52:50.71]I'm not gross.
[52:51.61]It's fucking wet.
[52:52.97]I am not a gross person, okay?
[52:59.56]I'm gonna hug the wall.
[53:01.44]Guys, I don't even care about souls at this point.
[53:03.14]I really don't.
[53:04.78]I need to find the correct way to go.
[53:06.22]Am I...
[53:13.53]I'm not like that angry.
[53:14.63]I mean, that was kind of jokey.
[53:17.15]Did you hear the way that I said that?
[53:18.21]I was like, oh, it's a giant dragon!
[53:19.43]I mean, like, it was a joke.
[53:20.31]It was a jokey thing.
[53:23.27]This whole DLC has been jokey.
[53:28.63]Please do not stick me with the kebabs.
[53:33.50]Alright.
[53:36.08]I'm going up this way.
[53:36.88]Let's take our time now.
[53:38.20]Let's not be idiots.
[53:41.85]One of those spiders is right behind me.
[53:44.58]Okay, I fucking booted the guy.
[53:46.32]I really thought that was going to work.
[53:59.63]I felt like it worked last time.
[54:06.02]Is he a jokey?
[54:09.71]Takes a lot of cleaning to clean up.
[54:11.37]Yeah, it does.
[54:11.85]I need to take a shower for, like, three hours.
[54:15.29]And, like, I have to scrub with a loofah.
[54:18.35]And by the time I'm done, the loofah is, like, mud.
[54:22.50]And I scraped the fungus off of his backside.
[54:25.08]Yeah, I got, like, mushrooms growing on my back.
[54:27.48]They have to be, like, ripped out from the root.
[54:29.18]This is disgusting, by the way.
[54:30.60]Why are we even talking about this?
[54:35.14]Alright, um...
[54:40.44]I guess I'm going to wrap around that way.
[54:44.92]Not much to do over there.
[54:45.96]Let's go this way.
[54:52.71]This is just to avoid the Father Time guy, in my opinion.
[54:55.51]I hear a lot of noise, though.
[55:03.87]I'm scared to touch this.
[55:04.75]What does it say?
[55:05.51]I can't take this.
[55:07.74]You can't take what, exactly?
[55:10.24]The fact that the tree has free items?
[55:14.24]This is some Hansel and Gretel shit right here, I'm telling you.
[55:19.72]The witch is going to come out of there and, like, scream at me.
[55:21.66]Hey, Dedo!
[55:26.23]Mr. Kool-Aid also gave five bucks a little while ago.
[55:29.29]Somebody else gave some.
[55:30.01]Hold on.
[55:30.29]Let me go.
[55:30.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[55:31.53]I got my Twitch alerts thing on the other side.
[55:35.19]Uh, Dedo, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[55:36.29]Off topic, but will the Oreos and your mother's bed story ever be told?
[55:39.57]I need, okay, I need to like a... I'm gonna have to say this, like, I'm gonna make like a fucking audio file.
[55:47.78]I'm gonna like say on stream the Oreo story.
[55:51.52]So it can just be like, exclamation point, Oreo story.
[55:54.98]So at any time you want to hear it, you'll be able to hear it.
[56:00.39]And you can hear the full story.
[56:04.67]And the full story, by the way, is like 32 seconds long.
[56:11.20]But, yes, I've told it before.
[56:15.68]It is a gross story.
[56:20.71]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[56:21.73]I will absolutely tell that story one day.
[56:24.71]What's the place to go in here?
[56:28.09]This scares me, though.
[56:30.34]Anything on the ceiling?
[56:33.33]Church Guardian Shiv?
[56:34.49]What is that?
[56:35.05]I kind of want it.
[56:37.89]I've got like two new weapons that I haven't really tried that I want to look at.
[56:41.45]I don't have an opportunity.
[56:42.37]Give me one second.
[56:45.19]Okay.
[56:46.81]Hold on.
[56:47.25]I hear something.
[56:48.25]Yeah.
[56:50.62]That would have been really bad.
[56:51.74]I got a Shiv?
[56:59.06]And somebody's arm.
[57:01.87]Somebody's hand or something.
[57:03.03]Oh, there it is.
[57:05.41]It's a staff.
[57:08.27]What about that shiv?
[57:10.45]Is that the dagger that you guys are talking about that was really good in the DLC?
[57:15.84]Where the hell did it go?
[57:23.36]What was that?
[57:28.96]It was weird and blue.
[57:30.07]Is it not a weapon?
[57:33.19]I guess that's not a weapon.
[57:36.76]It's just an item?
[57:37.48]Oh, there it is.
[57:40.64]Throw illusory blades that seek foes.
[57:44.79]Oh, it's just like a spell.
[57:46.61]Unlimited use.
[57:50.69]Let's give it a try.
[57:52.13]I'm going to throw my boomerang out and see what happens.
[58:03.89]This is actually really cool.
[58:05.29]This is so cool.
[58:08.35]That's so cool.
[58:12.35]I don't have any more.
[58:12.99]Oh, well.
[58:21.94]Gonna have to go to Coin Star.
[58:24.48]Um, we're actually running out of money to, like... No, it's okay.
[58:28.73]Here comes a bird.
[58:31.01]You can give me that money, if you want.
[58:36.69]Oh no, I'm gonna have to be on my A game for this guy.
[58:41.34]That's a boss from the original game.
[58:45.34]Right?
[58:46.00]This is the Dragonslayer.
[58:47.62]What is he doing here and why is he still alive?
[58:54.47]Well, let's fight the Dragonslayer.
[59:00.03]Just a regular enemy.
[59:08.02]Forget his entire pattern, by the way.
[59:09.68]Seriously?
[59:14.90]I'm gonna go on the goddamn edge.
[59:23.94]I'm gonna go off the edge here, I know it.
[59:39.45]Be patient and I'll get him.
[59:52.66]It's a throwback!
[60:07.31]Not that time!
[60:29.37]Ow Excuse me
[61:02.18]Alright.
[61:03.42]Oh, no!
[61:03.78]Don't say alright!
[61:04.54]Don't say alright before he's dead.
[61:05.74]Okay, he's dead.
[61:10.65]Why did they... That was... Thanks for the boi.
[61:13.35]That counts as a boss, by the way.
[61:16.77]That's a first try boss, by the way.
[61:18.35]First try.
[61:22.79]And he got... I want to see that armor.
[61:26.91]Deaths?
[61:27.45]I don't know.
[61:28.62]60 probably.
[61:35.37]Okay.
[61:37.05]And where is his stuff?
[61:39.57]Damn.
[61:41.32]That thing is nasty looking too.
[61:44.62]What else we got?
[61:47.08]Where was it?
[61:53.82]How heavy is this gonna make me?
[61:57.92]Iron Dragonslayer Armor.
[62:02.24]That makes me too heavy.
[62:08.84]He's like sleeping with a hard drive.
[62:15.69]Hi.
[62:18.17]I just look like a fucking chicken.
[62:21.33]Oh, okay.
[62:22.09]Now I have to be a chicken.
[62:26.19]I just have to be a rooster, right?
[62:27.45]I need to have my tiny chicken legs.
[62:35.00]That's fine.
[62:40.46]I'm okay with rolling around like this for a little while, even if it sucks.
[62:43.78]I'm just gonna be the chicken guy with the chicken hair.
[62:46.63]Perfect.
[62:47.01]I don't even care if I fat roll.
[62:48.73]It's worth it.
[62:52.77]Yeah, you can't, like, roll well either.
[62:59.69]Um, I don't have a million dollars.
[63:02.13]That got a million bits, though!
[63:06.77]Million bits is like, what, like a thousand bucks?
[63:09.27]Like ten thousand bucks?
[63:13.13]Hey, I've got ten thousand dollars.
[63:15.09]Like, to my life savings.
[63:16.75]What is this?
[63:19.61]Cool.
[63:20.59]Uh, the joke's over now, by the way.
[63:21.87]I don't want to actually lose because of this.
[63:23.95]Okay, that's fine.
[63:30.11]Uh, let's go this way.
[63:33.03]Put my legs back on, or at least something equivalent.
[63:46.26]Whatever.
[63:46.58]It's fashion souls.
[63:47.70]Who cares?
[63:48.10]I have a lot of money.
[63:52.18]It's not money.
[63:52.72]I don't know why I keep calling it money, but it's souls.
[63:59.88]How am I going to get over there?
[64:01.06]I just have to bait out the dragon?
[64:05.12]I kind of want a homeward bone.
[64:11.83]I can sort of do.
[64:13.83]Just level up once.
[64:20.85]That's one of these spear guys.
[64:22.01]These guys, I hate them, but... Black Witch Veil.
[64:26.73]Not sure what that is.
[64:27.69]I'm just going to bait the dragon out.
[64:35.00]This is a bad idea.
[64:37.00]Item ahead.
[64:37.70]Yeah.
[64:38.74]I see.
[64:39.10]I see the item.
[64:41.10]But I can't get to it.
[64:42.44]I have to drop off the side of the bridge?
[64:46.97]I feel like that's going to kill me.
[64:50.15]Hey, $400 money.
[64:51.61]Thank you, Samadat.
[64:52.33]$4.
[64:53.27]It says money.
[64:54.41]Yes, money.
[65:12.13]Get your dragon stuff out of here.
[65:28.77]Why are you in a different phase?
[65:38.74]Backstab.
[65:39.22]Come on.
[65:39.58]If that wasn't a backstab...
[65:41.90]I highly doubt that.
[65:52.41]This is a very serious game.
[65:54.95]I gotta have a serious game face when I'm playing a game like this.
[65:57.16]This is a serious game.
[66:02.14]You don't understand.
[66:02.72]This is like... By the way, I'm running by this because now both of them are aggroed.
[66:09.14]Why does every enemy in this DLC have a fire weapon?
[66:11.00]That's a good question.
[66:11.90]Why are they all annoying?
[66:14.35]That's what I want to know.
[66:17.91]Can I bait the dragon out?
[66:19.31]Does he just go by?
[66:20.15]I wonder if he's just going to fly by and go like... Let's try it.
[66:25.20]Here we go.
[66:28.85]He's coming this way still.
[66:30.25]Alright.
[66:31.68]Where'd he go?
[66:33.20]He flies off into the night.
[66:34.68]Nice.
[66:35.40]I wonder if I only have, like, a certain amount of time.
[66:38.04]I'm not going yet.
[66:38.66]Has he come back?
[66:40.81]He's gonna come back, and he's gonna Looney Tunes me right now.
[66:44.29]I'm telling you.
[66:45.37]I knew it.
[66:45.95]I knew I was gonna get Looney Tuned.
[66:54.24]I knew he was gonna come back.
[66:55.66]For some reason, it took him too long to come back.
[66:59.88]That I thought he wasn't gonna come back.
[67:06.51]Seriously.
[67:07.11]Like, it took him too long to come back in my brain that there was no way he was going to come back.
[67:14.75]And why did I die that time?
[67:20.08]What a, like, monumental pain.
[67:25.63]This DLC is just the monumental pain in the ass DLC.
[67:31.21]That's all this is.
[67:31.83]Alright, you remember... Don't!
[67:37.69]Seriously, don't die here.
[67:38.86]Like, I'm just talking shit and I'm not gonna die.
[67:46.04]Remember in the base game?
[67:48.80]Smoldering Lake?
[67:49.46]Remember Smoldering Lake?
[67:51.74]There was just an obnoxious crossbow that shot you the whole time?
[67:56.49]I feel like they really, like, wanted more of that for some reason.
[68:01.40]They decided to put more of that crap.
[68:03.08]Hey, there's, like, random stuff that just, like, instantly kills you or, like, knocks you down, and there's a ton of it.
[68:11.66]Get out of town, man.
[68:19.55]This used to be a mayonnaise stream.
[68:21.59]It was.
[68:23.55]It was.
[68:25.55]And we lost all hope.
[68:28.32]Alright.
[68:28.64]Where the hell am I going?
[68:29.52]Over here?
[68:30.44]Yeah.
[68:34.20]At least the lake isn't poisoned this time.
[68:35.80]That's true.
[68:37.16]If this was a poisoned lake, then FromSoftware is making a joke.
[68:43.68]If that was a toxic lake, all the guys at FromSoftware are high-fiving and laughing.
[68:51.64]They decided to make the whole DLC Old Yharnam.
[68:54.32]Yeah.
[68:55.20]Really.
[68:57.90]But thank you to Bia345.
[68:59.94]One of the Bias.
[69:01.38]Gave 10 bucks.
[69:02.06]Says, potty mouth.
[69:03.34]Swear fund for the potty mouth streamer.
[69:06.58]Thank you.
[69:06.98]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[69:09.84]Now, I'm gonna go immediately here, right?
[69:13.24]He's gonna jump.
[69:14.12]Here he comes.
[69:15.52]Once that fire is gone, I'm going immediately.
[69:17.94]One...
[69:19.63]three four five sicko no we're not we're not going I just heard him I heard I heard him yup see can I can I make that I'm not sure I can make that I really don't know if I can do that he goes back and forth I'm not sure I can do should I shoot him with a bone arrow
[69:47.22]Why would you jump?
[69:48.02]I didn't even jump.
[69:48.74]I pressed the button in accidentally.
[69:53.08]I'm going the next time.
[69:54.90]Hopefully I don't die.
[69:58.94]I know.
[69:59.24]Don't worry.
[69:59.54]I know somebody gave me $100.
[70:00.80]I know.
[70:01.26]Trust me.
[70:01.78]I'm certain of it.
[70:03.90]Oh my god.
[70:05.75]Alright.
[70:05.99]This one's for you, Spoychem.
[70:07.01]This one's for you.
[70:08.29]I'm going to make it across.
[70:09.09]1, 2, 3.
[70:13.74]That was the one.
[70:14.80]I went there.
[70:16.04]Just give me my souls in case I die.
[70:18.56]Should I hide?
[70:20.18]I think I should hide, like, right here.
[70:28.25]Ah!
[70:30.79]Oh, God!
[70:31.99]What are you doing?
[70:32.51]Don't push me!
[70:33.55]Don't push me back!
[70:35.98]They... Seriously.
[70:37.76]You're pushing me back out there.
[70:41.82]Wow.
[70:44.88]Okay.
[70:47.72]Spoycam, thank you for the $150.
[70:49.28]And you say, here's a goddamn question.
[70:52.83]Ah, swear jar.
[70:53.33]There you go.
[70:55.19]Okay.
[70:56.23]If a very sociable person is called a people person, then is a very sociable goose called a geese goose?
[71:06.03]That was a good one.
[71:07.23]That was a good one.
[71:09.11]You know?
[71:10.31]That was a fucking good one.
[71:13.17]Yes, I believe it is.
[71:13.99]I believe I would call that a geese goose.
[71:16.62]Thank you for the $150 joke.
[71:19.86]It was a A-plus joke.
[71:23.68]I don't want to fall off and die, because then I will scream.
[71:28.70]That's it.
[71:31.02]Hey, look at you.
[71:31.42]Everyone in chat is laughing at that.
[71:34.64]Wait, wait for the... Where's the dragon?
[71:37.22]Where is that... Where's that American dragon?
[71:40.64]From that Cartoon Network show.
[71:43.34]Wow.
[71:44.00]Jake and the Neverland Pirates.
[71:45.14]Come back.
[71:47.94]Come on.
[71:49.90]I'm going to assume that's the boss.
[71:51.54]And that's what I'm fighting next.
[71:53.24]I mean, of course it is.
[71:54.46]Why wouldn't it be?
[71:55.88]Go, go, go, go, go.
[71:56.62]No, it'll burn me.
[71:58.26]I go now.
[72:01.20]Any more cubbyholes?
[72:03.82]Free item.
[72:04.96]It was rubbish.
[72:07.97]Didn't think I was going to do that, did you?
[72:12.67]Of course they put rubbish right there.
[72:14.11]Why?
[72:15.41]FromSoftware, why?
[72:16.63]Huh?
[72:19.29]Is he still going?
[72:24.40]Uh, we're gonna wait.
[72:25.38]I ain't gonna mess this up.
[72:29.50]There's another little spot right there, though, that I want to go through.
[72:31.38]This guy's gonna get killed.
[72:33.58]Hopefully.
[72:35.62]I think I just have to mute fire, apparently.
[72:42.08]I was trying to go for a joke there, but I just get the sure thing.
[72:44.48]I ain't messing around.
[72:49.12]There's a spot in here.
[72:50.09]There's a cookie bug.
[72:53.97]That's a death if I fall.
[72:56.25]Oh dear, there's even more stuff to explore.
[73:01.15]No, no.
[73:02.99]No.
[73:08.75]No, and I kept getting invaded.
[73:12.04]No!
[73:13.62]They did not... They did not... They didn't test this properly!
[73:18.56]They didn't test this DLC properly!
[73:25.13]I gotta get off the stairs.
[73:27.83]They're just... Monsters!
[73:34.23]You... Monsters!
[73:37.88]FromSoftware, you monsters!
[73:40.61]How dare you?
[73:42.17]How dare you make us gamers go through such gamer's descent?
[73:47.39]How did he die?
[73:50.62]How did he die?
[73:51.50]Wait, that guy just died.
[73:53.22]That guy gave up and died.
[73:55.12]I think he might have fallen off the cliff accidentally.
[73:57.50]Thank God, FromSoftware, for your dumb AI that jumps off cliffs.
[74:02.41]Holy shit.
[74:07.01]What did I just get from that, by the way?
[74:10.96]I don't even know.
[74:11.50]I don't know.
[74:14.68]Thanks for making it easy for me.
[74:18.06]Can I make this jump?
[74:20.87]No.
[74:24.67]There's a place to go out there.
[74:27.73]Can I go this way?
[74:28.45]I guess.
[74:32.34]I don't even know.
[74:34.12]Let there be skeleton and then skeleton.
[74:44.73]I don't... Long finger.
[74:51.73]I'm kind of getting turned around right now.
[74:53.61]What am I doing?
[74:58.54]I thought I was... I guess I have to drop down again.
[75:04.16]That's what I did last time.
[75:05.04]Okay.
[75:06.71]Go up.
[75:12.60]Okay, time for treasure.
[75:15.90]This better not be a mimic.
[75:20.10]Seriously, like FromSoftware, you put a mimic here.
[75:22.32]It's a mimic.
[75:23.32]They actually did it.
[75:24.24]These madmen.
[75:26.13]These madmen put a mimic in this room.
[75:29.29]You've got to be kidding me.
[75:33.01]How are you supposed to fight a mimic in this area?
[75:38.13]You're just not.
[75:38.81]You just don't.
[75:39.47]You don't fight the Mimic.
[75:41.22]You fight the Mimic.
[75:49.36]Please fall off.
[75:50.00]That would have instant killed me.
[76:02.00]Slow down.
[76:02.98]Don't let him boot you.
[76:12.11]I hate ring of the evil eye plus three.
[76:14.25]I hate mimics.
[76:20.80]The absolute madman is going to fight it.
[76:26.66]Door ahead.
[76:29.54]Really?
[76:31.00]You know, we're going to give this one a pour.
[76:34.72]Disparage this message.
[76:38.25]Rate that one pour.
[76:40.56]There's a door here.
[76:41.68]Of course there is.
[76:44.32]What you should have said is, watch out for the skeleton that appears right when you walk in the front door.
[76:47.88]Like, how come that's not the note?
[76:53.75]I don't know.
[77:04.40]This reminds me of the Catacombs of Carthus.
[77:10.49]Not a bad thing, but not necessarily a good thing either.
[77:12.51]I found that area to be like a pretty meh out of 10.
[77:19.85]Easy.
[77:20.37]I hear somebody running.
[77:22.85]Who's running?
[77:23.58]Who's walking?
[77:25.68]I hate that.
[77:26.58]When you hear the footsteps, you just don't even know where they're coming from.
[77:31.30]What does the Ring of the Evil Eye do?
[77:33.26]I guess I could... Nice.
[77:38.94]I'm so glad to see a bonfire.
[77:40.12]I gotta go back.
[77:40.72]I have a lot of souls.
[77:43.28]Shared Grave is the name of this one.
[77:53.49]Just waiting for the guy to push you.
[77:54.57]I would be very sad about that.
[77:58.37]Let's crush our Crunch Berries.
[78:00.99]We crashed again?
[78:01.77]What the?
[78:05.07]What?
[78:07.67]It's a Twitch thing.
[78:21.61]That's weird.
[78:23.59]Are we back?
[78:26.87]I was supposed to say refund.
[78:28.49]Refresh.
[78:33.66]So this is the... We're on a third server now.
[78:39.24]So... Okie dokie.
[78:44.08]Okie dokie.
[78:47.84]I'm going to move that.
[78:49.16]Let's get back into this.
[78:53.03]At least that was a decent place to stop for you guys if anybody, like, just crashed there.
[78:56.87]You guys crashed out.
[78:57.65]Because I'm just kind of doing stuff in the menus at the moment.
[79:00.47]Alright, let me see what she can do for me now.
[79:07.82]I think I'm going for either Endurance or... I can do two.
[79:13.08]Two Endurance or should I get Dexterity to 50 and call it a day?
[79:18.28]Mmm, two Endurance.
[79:20.52]Get Endurance to 40.
[79:23.83]How many do I need?
[79:27.55]I need... I can do another one.
[79:29.43]20,000.
[79:29.69]I can get that.
[79:32.53]The transcoder... The transcoder couldn't handle all the swearing and dying.
[79:37.73]But yeah, it is a Twitch thing.
[79:38.71]Oh, whatever.
[79:40.21]It's not a big deal.
[79:43.96]It's no big deal.
[79:47.08]That 10 vitality, though.
[79:48.48]I know.
[79:48.88]I know.
[79:53.23]I need like 2,000.
[79:56.70]Hey, Jerma, what's up, man?
[79:57.76]It's me, the blood-starved beast from Bloodborne 101 last semester.
[80:01.92]I didn't know you were... Oh, and I was like reading... I was just reading that message and it got deleted.
[80:11.22]So, I guess... Oh, fuck.
[80:20.40]What have I done?
[80:24.10]Boy, that's gonna... I'm just gonna start.
[80:26.75]I just started something that I probably shouldn't have.
[80:29.81]Hey, me, it's the blood-starved... Hey, me, it's the blood-starved beast.
[80:37.03]Falling for the coffee pasta?
[80:38.21]No, I wanted to read the coffee pasta.
[80:40.71]That was an interesting one.
[80:42.75]Don't blame mods for what Jeremy wanted.
[80:49.08]Oh, boy.
[80:50.10]Okay, I need to sell, like, some of these bug repellents.
[80:52.74]Who cares?
[80:53.26]Just all of them.
[80:54.04]I don't even want them.
[80:57.50]Like, I... Who cares, right?
[81:01.69]It's like Steve Ruhl would say.
[81:02.83]Like, who cares?
[81:04.57]Do I have enough now?
[81:05.39]I knew it was going to start.
[81:09.19]I feel like... You're such a dog.
[81:14.25]You have my summons.
[81:15.35]Just hit me up.
[81:16.15]Oh, my God.
[81:16.94]That's so perfect.
[81:21.65]Should I put a point into vitality?
[81:24.32]Or is that just a lost cause at this point?
[81:25.70]What do you think?
[81:32.73]Let's get this to 38.
[81:37.65]I wasn't doing a Steve Brule impression.
[81:38.95]I was just talking.
[81:39.73]I was pretending to talk to be Steve Brule.
[81:46.29]That's just some of that milk.
[81:47.96]I just mixed it in there to make it just... It was like that much left.
[81:50.96]I just poured it up just to fill it.
[81:53.90]Have something to sip on while I'm in this plane.
[81:55.96]We did have coffee.
[81:58.54]Yeah, but this was a little thicker.
[81:59.56]The Vietnamese coffee is thicker.
[82:03.46]Yeah, I know.
[82:03.92]You could just add... What?
[82:05.95]Add water?
[82:06.65]Add more coffee?
[82:07.87]Add milk?
[82:08.69]Add more coffee in the condensed milk.
[82:10.75]Yeah, that's true.
[82:11.65]I wanted like a little chocolate surprise, you know?
[82:14.76]I'm really into the chocolate surprise sometimes.
[82:17.32]What?
[82:20.82]What does that mean?
[82:23.06]And I'm not... Okay, guys.
[82:25.13]So, we're going to just move on.
[82:26.57]What am I doing?
[82:31.27]And what you meant to say after that was that we bought chocolate bars from this store.
[82:37.59]Big, like, chocolate bars, and they're delicious.
[82:39.97]And we're going to eat them after the stream.
[82:41.90]And that's her little joke that she made.
[82:43.88]And, you know, she's not saying that right now, but that's exactly what she was trying to say.
[82:47.30]No, I wasn't.
[82:47.90]She was trying to say that, and that wasn't even her.
[82:50.44]That was somebody else just came in the room and said those words.
[82:55.58]And, yeah, that's what that was.
[82:58.40]And I'm going to fucking die on stream.
[83:00.37]Jeremy likes to get shit on off-stream.
[83:07.50]And she means that by, like, you know, like, making fun of me.
[83:09.86]Like, a term of endearment.
[83:10.82]Like, you know, like, get shit on.
[83:12.22]Like, she's talking about, like, shitting on me as, like, a term of poking fun, in a way.
[83:16.18]But you really don't mean it that much.
[83:18.50]You mean it's, um... You're just joking.
[83:21.14]You're just, like, in jest, kind of messing around.
[83:26.36]And I'm walking in circles now.
[83:27.94]Can this... Can this please stop?
[83:30.23]There it is.
[83:33.11]No, that's not it.
[83:35.02]Why did I have to do... I'm homeward boning.
[83:36.84]I have so many of them, I don't care.
[83:40.10]I don't care at all.
[83:41.52]What was that noise?
[83:47.36]Oh, it's the heater.
[83:49.42]I actually have to pee now.
[83:51.86]It says I've only been streaming for five minutes, but I've been streaming for like an hour and twenty minutes, haven't I?
[83:56.07]Or like at least an hour?
[83:57.43]I don't know.
[83:59.56]Okay.
[84:00.32]I'm gonna pee.
[84:00.80]I'll be right back.
[84:01.38]Hopefully Twitch doesn't break.
[84:04.21]Walking in circles because his secret is out.
[84:06.21]No, that was just a joke.
[84:08.19]This is a joke.
[84:08.93]She's making a joke.
[84:09.77]It's a joke stream.
[84:11.71]This is a comedy stream.
[84:19.82]Alright, gonna get some fucking tea.
[84:21.78]I'll be right back.
[85:57.39]Fuck, I have a black screen.
[87:04.54]Alright, so what happened here?
[87:06.76]I went to go, like, pee.
[87:11.04]And she, like, what, she turned the stream on?
[87:12.48]Did she say any, like, swears or anything?
[87:14.34]As long as she just didn't say any, like, swear words, I don't even care.
[87:23.25]Hold on.
[87:28.01]There we go.
[87:31.95]Why is the toilet pulsating?
[87:35.35]Why isn't the toilet pulsating is what you meant to say.
[87:37.47]It should be.
[87:37.97]So you told us all of your secrets.
[87:41.17]Well, I don't have very many.
[87:43.09]And here's the dragon.
[87:44.03]Is this not even a boss?
[87:46.73]I don't know.
[87:47.13]It's just a regular dragon, huh?
[87:54.75]I don't know if he's going to breathe.
[87:59.23]Why did I think I was safe here?
[88:01.25]Why am I still getting hit?
[88:03.97]Alright, well, we're going in.
[88:06.49]Can I, like, kick him off the edge?
[88:14.79]Can I, like, smash his fingers and have him fall down?
[88:22.33]What is he doing?
[88:22.85]What in the name of God?
[88:24.29]I'm actually okay, though.
[88:29.26]I can't believe this is not a boss.
[88:38.42]I didn't dodge that guy, apparently.
[88:40.18]Somehow.
[88:40.48]Huge tail.
[88:43.64]Arms.
[88:44.08]Here comes the stupid beam.
[88:57.87]Like... Kim, if you can hear me, yes, the salmon in the fridge is fine.
[89:01.19]It's good.
[89:04.30]It is good.
[89:04.88]Good.
[89:10.69]At least it's right here.
[89:13.81]Maybe I should just run by him.
[89:31.93]Maybe I should just run by him.
[89:35.13]I'm gonna fall off.
[89:40.51]I kind of want to just kill him though.
[89:41.95]I feel like that would be fun to do.
[89:48.01]Somebody was talking about a blue shell earlier.
[89:49.65]I'm just happy.
[90:01.57]Yeah, I just got to get him in my hands.
[90:14.96]Where's that bar?
[90:17.26]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[90:23.44]Where's it going?
[90:31.39]Damn, dude.
[90:37.86]Slide.
[90:39.88]Yep, yep, yep.
[90:44.91]this way don't get hit by these flames it sucks fighting him here by the way like I probably shouldn't be doing this but I'm going through anyways what's he doing where's he going
[91:13.29]The big thing that gets me is that beam.
[91:15.04]I gotta be careful of that.
[91:17.12]There's the fire again.
[91:30.12]Sorry about me again, that's fine.
[91:35.68]This is like very... He became very predictable.
[91:46.00]He's doing the same move now.
[91:50.13]Okay.
[91:52.31]I didn't get him with the last one.
[91:53.71]Maybe I'll get him with it another five times in a row.
[92:04.78]Well, I found the Chi strategy with the dragon.
[92:08.52]Or did I?
[92:10.38]Yeah, I did.
[92:11.68]Wait.
[92:12.38]Here comes a visceral right in his face.
[92:15.71]See you later.
[92:16.83]One more hit.
[92:20.81]No?
[92:22.11]Now the real fight begins.
[92:30.36]What do you mean the real fight begins?
[92:34.98]Do I have to jump on top of him?
[92:38.98]He's right down there, right?
[92:40.78]Okay, I'm going for it.
[92:41.48]Wait, where is he?
[92:45.02]Is his body down there?
[93:18.70]Now the real fight begins.
[93:20.98]Well, I figured you could, like, I thought they were gonna... Look, that's the first time that fall damage has ever been an issue for me in this entire DLC.
[93:29.15]I thought you drop down and you stick the sword in his back and he goes... And then, like, the music goes... And, like, he has a sword in his back and it's like...
[93:45.02]So screw... Screw me for... Secret... He actually does turn into a turtle shell.
[93:53.59]You guys are right.
[93:56.09]Why is he doing like a Peter Griffin, by the way?
[93:59.09]That was a Peter Griffin.
[94:01.29]Like that.
[94:01.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[94:02.80]Like that.
[94:03.48]Wow.
[94:04.12]I shouldn't be doing Peter Griffin.
[94:05.24]That was dumb.
[94:07.26]Is there more walls here?
[94:11.02]Wall behind wall behind wall.
[94:12.12]Lightning arrow.
[94:12.78]Cool.
[94:17.68]I hear a cookie bug.
[94:24.04]Another one?
[94:28.25]I guess not.
[94:34.37]Unless there's another wall that I'm connected to this one, maybe?
[94:37.61]No?
[94:38.51]Alright, maybe it's upstairs.
[94:44.15]Yeah, don't do Peter Griffin.
[94:45.15]I didn't even mean to do it.
[94:46.29]It just happened because I was going like, yeah.
[94:50.63]I'm so sorry about that, guys.
[94:54.46]Yeah.
[95:00.46]There he is.
[95:02.90]There's that cookie bug.
[95:05.34]There he is.
[95:06.00]Come here.
[95:07.35]There.
[95:09.65]Twinkling Titanite.
[95:16.94]My child.
[95:20.21]Try jumping.
[95:39.70]Fuck you.
[95:46.18]Okay.
[95:48.37]Ah!
[95:48.65]Praise the bonfire!
[95:53.23]Shortcut!
[96:00.82]Does not open from this side.
[96:05.92]Cool.
[96:07.81]Now this is the first bonfire, ain't it?
[96:10.09]It is.
[96:12.51]Get downvoted.
[96:15.47]Get downvoted, dude.
[96:24.63]I said a square?
[96:28.03]I'll just grab a handful and put it in there like an hour.
[96:32.92]Like in two hours I'll just grab a handful of coins and just like whip it in there.
[96:40.60]Yeah.
[96:48.19]I can't double down rate it.
[96:53.93]You definitely cra- You crashed through the ceiling!
[96:55.89]What am I doing?
[96:58.33]You break through the ceiling.
[97:05.35]Nothing.
[97:10.02]I missed the secret, did I?
[97:11.08]Do you remember the secret?
[97:13.18]What secret?
[97:13.62]Where's the secret?
[97:15.06]The secret?
[97:17.13]What's this?
[97:17.43]How do I do it?
[97:17.85]What's the secret?
[97:27.15]I am the secret hunter.
[97:28.03]You're right.
[97:29.05]I missed a secret?
[97:30.65]Is it one of these secrets?
[97:39.86]Oh, it's one of these secrets.
[97:40.94]Yep.
[97:41.60]Okay.
[97:44.48]I got this.
[97:47.34]Got it.
[97:51.40]And there's this secret.
[97:53.70]This ember.
[97:55.92]And illusion ahead.
[97:56.79]I don't even need the wiki page.
[98:05.95]What's over there?
[98:09.01]Nice.
[98:10.83]Filanor's spear ornament.
[98:14.82]Anymore?
[98:15.22]No.
[98:17.10]Okay, we're just gonna go down.
[98:18.30]That's a long drop.
[98:28.55]Uh... Wait a minute, this is... Antiquated plain garb violet rep... This is, uh... Friend ahead.
[98:43.30]Isn't this the cathedral?
[98:47.41]Where am I going right now?
[98:48.83]Am I safe?
[98:58.19]Oh, shit.
[99:02.29]Oh, shit.
[99:05.73]Well... Dark Eater Medeir.
[99:20.43]Alright, so it begins.
[99:21.55]A lot of fire.
[99:30.62]Phase two.
[99:31.58]Yeah, this counts as phase two.
[99:33.77]There better not be a phase three.
[99:45.58]Blind?
[99:47.92]What is blind?
[99:51.78]I'm not going to use any items, I'm just going to see what he does.
[99:57.23]I'm obviously going to get him right in the face.
[100:02.65]Oh, what's that?
[100:03.17]Okay, fire.
[100:05.63]That is terrifying.
[100:06.69]He stands right up!
[100:08.53]Wow!
[100:10.77]He does the prairie dog.
[100:23.80]A lot of health.
[100:24.56]Okay, that's like a bullet health.
[100:30.90]Gotta avoid the bullet health.
[100:36.34]Just go for it.
[100:45.73]See if this doesn't hit me.
[100:48.75]Not really.
[101:00.86]He does it.
[101:01.16]That was part of that moveset!
[101:10.23]To full health!
[101:23.05]Hmm...
[101:28.79]Wow!
[101:29.95]That was a new move.
[101:38.09]Ow.
[101:38.15]Did I go behind him?
[101:49.96]How am I supposed to even know where that's going?
[102:01.87]I haven't even been able to swing him.
[102:09.45]I hardly get the chance to swing him again, guys.
[102:17.23]I wonder if he has like a weak point that'll knock him down.
[102:23.03]I'm sure he does.
[102:25.38]Ow.
[102:27.24]I'm in trouble now.
[102:41.17]Wow, what the?
[102:43.03]What the fuck?
[102:54.36]Dead here.
[102:55.02]See ya.
[102:56.26]See ya later.
[103:01.90]There.
[103:03.22]He has a trillion health.
[103:08.97]Alright.
[103:12.13]Oh well.
[103:14.39]I guess it's just a long fight.
[103:17.25]Maybe I could just try to stay under his stomach.
[103:21.76]Stay under his belly in a way.
[103:27.12]Think this is just a fight that you have to just you have to be good.
[103:32.52]I love us his friend ahead.
[103:40.07]Should I do that every time?
[103:41.25]That little skip?
[103:44.17]Or does that lead... Is this just a faster way to get to him?
[103:50.78]Actually, I want this.
[103:56.86]Plus three.
[103:57.48]Okay, I wanted to get that.
[104:05.71]This is the first boss he's fought.
[104:06.79]This is the first real named boss, yes.
[104:11.12]Give me one second, though.
[104:15.61]What is over here?
[104:16.11]I just want to see what's over here.
[104:22.87]It's this guy.
[104:23.43]I've never seen one of these videos.
[104:30.47]Like, bosses.
[104:31.65]What is this crap?
[104:42.95]Holy crap.
[104:44.33]You are a maniac.
[104:48.84]Slow, though.
[104:55.26]That's a secret boss?
[104:56.30]That is a secret boss.
[105:05.36]Okay.
[105:06.65]Wow!
[105:08.43]What?! !
[105:09.98]What?
[105:10.68]What was that?
[105:11.76]What did he just do?
[105:14.27]Like a Street Fighter EX move to me.
[105:19.07]There was no way for me to know that was gonna happen.
[105:32.80]Dude just sits there and does the same string of moves for the whole fight and then throws in
[105:41.52]like, stupid ranged Link from Legend of Zelda move at full health.
[105:51.27]Oh, fuck off.
[105:55.58]No, I'm fighting that guy again.
[105:57.44]No, we're not going to the dragon right now.
[105:58.98]I'm so irritated at that, like, throw in the, like, 8% chance for him to do that move.
[106:12.49]Oh, God.
[106:12.95]Oh, did you see that new move I can do?
[106:16.13]It's a spin attack.
[106:19.09]I have five times more stamina than you.
[106:21.66]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[106:58.07]Don't fall down here.
[107:19.33]This guy should be the main character not you.
[107:23.74]Yeah, seriously.
[107:25.48]What is wrong with this guy that he can't be the main character?
[107:29.98]This guy's way cooler than me.
[107:31.78]He does way more damage than me.
[107:34.40]And his weapon is five times better.
[107:37.10]You're telling me this guy can't beat, like, the fucking champion Gundyr?
[107:45.17]You can't do that, buddy?
[107:48.23]You have like 50 times more health than I do.
[107:50.88]Three times more damage.
[107:53.56]And you're way cooler than me.
[107:56.24]What a fucking waste of potential you are.
[107:58.22]I'm gonna do a fucking late move.
[108:03.75]I'm gonna do a super spread.
[108:05.37]Jump us off.
[108:11.73]I wanna back... Give me that backstab.
[108:23.22]I thought I had it again.
[108:27.34]Burgah Boy.
[108:27.74]I want enough stamina for the Burgah Boy technique.
[108:33.31]Okay.
[108:35.07]Wow.
[108:38.39]Let me look at those.
[108:39.19]40 strength.
[108:48.50]That's awesome.
[108:52.82]Why would you ever make a Dex character?
[108:59.92]Am I crazy to say that all the strength-based weapons in Dark Souls are way cooler than all the Dex ones?
[109:13.63]Am I insane to say that?
[109:14.59]That's the dumbest weapon you've ever seen.
[109:33.13]Don't tell anyone you leveled that.
[109:42.30]Don't tell anybody you put points into that.
[109:47.34]That's funny.
[109:47.94]Alright, well, I'm coming in.
[109:49.26]Sorry, I know you're sleeping, but fuck you.
[109:53.09]Don't come in.
[109:54.51]Our mistress is sleeping.
[109:56.93]How dare you?
[110:02.82]Well, this is a boss, too.
[110:03.92]There's two bosses right here.
[110:05.28]There's, like, summoning signs.
[110:09.32]So, what is this one?
[110:12.92]This is a boss, I guess?
[110:22.15]Okay.
[110:24.03]Okay.
[110:34.15]Are we going?
[110:34.63]We're just going, right?
[110:54.95]This guy's just talking.
[110:58.23]Just kill him.
[111:00.99]Did I beat it?
[111:02.31]Did I kill the boss?
[111:03.85]Whoa!
[111:04.87]Hold on a second.
[111:06.83]Wait a minute.
[111:09.19]Wait a second.
[111:10.62]Wait a minute.
[111:11.52]Spear of the Church.
[111:12.48]Which one is the Spear of the Church?
[111:17.18]What's happening right now?
[111:21.68]Was I just being too jokey right there to know what was even happening to me?
[111:24.37]Okay, I...
[111:33.08]That's a real player?
[111:37.95]Wait a minute.
[111:38.59]Wait a minute.
[111:41.29]What?
[111:43.69]I'm so confused.
[111:48.79]That's a PvP boss?
[111:59.46]That's... So, alright.
[112:01.00]That's really interesting.
[112:04.32]Here's a question for you.
[112:06.12]So what happens in like a year when like... What happens in like five years when no one's playing this part of the game?
[112:13.62]Is that just gonna be like a regular dumb boss?
[112:20.36]Yeah, now I know that that's pretty interesting.
[112:26.53]Let's do that again.
[112:29.47]Do I have to fight Father Time again?
[112:30.61]Because that's annoying to me.
[112:32.17]Yeah, of course I do.
[112:34.95]Oh, there's an AI.
[112:35.61]Okay.
[112:37.47]Alright, I was making like a joke out of this this time.
[112:44.30]Let's actually fight this dude.
[112:45.62]Nope, wasn't expecting that.
[113:02.49]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[113:12.17]Okay, here we go.
[113:13.31]So this is the, this is the boss.
[113:15.52]That's not the boss.
[113:16.34]That's a character?
[113:17.00]Is that what I'm... Okay, no, no, no.
[113:24.28]So that's, that's a bad, that's a guy.
[113:29.22]Is this more than one?
[113:30.43]Okay, is healing considered like a bad thing here?
[113:39.07]Is this BM if I heal?
[113:41.77]I don't even care.
[113:42.41]I'm winning this fight.
[113:46.74]Why does this guy have like the cool fucking weapon?
[113:53.48]The white ones are the NPCs.
[113:54.80]Okay.
[114:06.09]That guy just got that item and leveled it up and can do all the cool new moves.
[114:12.78]I have my dumb katana that I've had since level 3.
[114:17.18]Why do I have this thing still?
[114:21.70]Don't even bother with Father Time.
[114:24.24]Really?
[114:31.52]This is the most basic shit weapon I could possibly equip.
[114:37.83]Hiya.
[114:41.29]Where's my cool weapon?
[114:43.05]I'm just too much of a wuss to take this off.
[114:48.93]Alright, so, tell me... Okay.
[114:56.44]I can't... Can I get back there now?
[115:07.07]So, I have a question for you, then.
[115:11.35]That person is just coming into these games?
[115:14.23]So, it's me versus two people.
[115:16.28]Every time.
[115:16.62]Yes.
[115:22.32]The King's decree is no trifling matter.
[115:25.75]So it's a PvP fight with an AI character that you also have to fight.
[115:33.91]I think that's how I'm understanding this.
[115:35.51]So I just have to burn the guy down.
[115:39.55]So I just have to get a kill.
[115:42.16]Get the NPC kill.
[115:44.42]One NPC sucks.
[115:45.32]Okay, yeah.
[115:46.62]I really should summon... Well, maybe I'll leave in the playing field after this.
[115:52.28]Where is he?
[115:52.58]Where is he?
[115:52.88]Where is he?
[115:53.14]Where is he?
[115:53.44]I gotta get right on top of him.
[115:55.56]That's not him.
[115:57.38]Where is he?
[116:01.76]Where's the player?
[116:06.10]There he is.
[116:06.46]Okay, so he has, like... Really gotta, like, go for the guy, right?
[116:21.70]Like, frozen.
[116:32.17]Oh, that's close!
[116:33.41]But I'm blocked!
[116:34.20]I'm blocked!
[116:39.10]Wow, more things spawn?
[116:41.42]What the fuck?
[116:42.86]More than one AI spawns?
[116:46.76]That's like unfair.
[116:55.65]Ah, come on.
[117:07.78]Die!
[117:08.92]Die!
[117:09.24]Yes!
[117:10.32]Get away from me!
[117:17.36]I did it.
[117:23.26]Damn.
[117:32.98]That's a really cool concept.
[117:36.22]I wish it just did like a 3v3 brawl.
[117:42.00]Or I wish... Get rid of the AI.
[117:46.02]Here's how I think you make that more fun.
[117:49.39]Get rid of the AI.
[117:52.01]Give the person that invades like three times health.
[117:55.89]But they cannot use any Estus Flasks.
[117:59.77]That sounds so much more fun.
[118:05.96]And make them grow.
[118:07.58]Scale them like two times bigger.
[118:09.21]That'd be so fun.
[118:12.75]I would do that.
[118:13.21]I would want to be the boss.
[118:17.56]Make sure I don't miss anything.
[118:18.56]Liar.
[118:24.96]They can't use Estus in the first place?
[118:26.36]Didn't I see somebody drink one?
[118:30.08]They can't really?
[118:31.44]I swear I saw somebody drink something.
[118:34.39]Or heal or something.
[118:35.67]Oh, that was probably the mana one, right?
[118:44.71]That's cool.
[118:47.85]Alright, so that technically is the second boss.
[118:51.50]There's four bosses in the DLC, right?
[118:55.74]That secret optional boss, the dragon...
[118:59.47]And there's one more storyline boss.
[119:01.19]That's the last boss, right?
[119:03.43]From what I understand.
[119:11.22]Oh, yeah.
[119:11.44]I should probably go level up.
[119:12.20]That's true.
[119:15.14]Yeah.
[119:15.56]What am I doing?
[119:21.88]You can be the boss.
[119:22.68]You want me to just do it?
[119:35.76]Don't walk there.
[119:40.59]The final boss is going to destroy me.
[119:41.95]I'm assuming it will.
[119:45.93]I could not, for the life of me, deal with the last boss in the last DLC.
[119:49.48]It was just too much.
[119:54.16]Did I not get a boss soul for that?
[119:57.99]Apparently not.
[120:04.40]What do you think?
[120:14.92]I think I'm just going to get dexterity to 50.
[120:17.79]Endurance 40, vigor 40.
[120:20.89]And try to get dex to as close to 45 or 50 as I can.
[120:23.79]I might be able to do it again.
[120:35.28]Let's see.
[120:36.80]It's going to be 20, right?
[120:42.11]I need 60, 60,000.
[120:45.83]You love the final boss.
[120:47.07]It's really cool.
[120:48.51]You keep co-opping to fight him again.
[120:52.72]The soft cap for Dex is 25.
[120:53.82]And then the hard cap is 50, I believe, right?
[121:00.64]Vitality is at 38, 39.
[121:10.96]Maybe I should just respec this character.
[121:17.44]So if I have... Where do I go to respec?
[121:19.86]I guess I don't have to.
[121:27.08]60.
[121:27.10]Soft cap is 40.
[121:35.76]Hard cap is 60.
[121:41.35]Alright, where's Rosaria?
[121:42.25]Where's Rosaria?
[121:53.05]Turn on the music.
[121:53.91]The music should be on.
[121:57.51]Rosaria's bedchamber.
[122:01.59]Where is that?
[122:07.04]Um...
[122:14.03]Do I even have that?
[122:17.91]There it is.
[122:25.11]What's going on, Hypo?
[122:26.87]Thank you, Hypo.
[122:30.77]The Firelink Shrine is the Jerma and chat have a discussion that goes way over my head room.
[122:36.72]It goes over my head too, man.
[122:39.52]There's a lot of information in this game.
[122:44.78]Alright, so talk.
[122:47.82]Join the covenant.
[122:50.34]Just join this covenant and give tongues or something.
[122:52.26]Make sure I don't do this wrong.
[122:57.01]Yeah.
[123:02.73]Join the covenant.
[123:05.97]I would love to join you.
[123:12.80]Hey, Rosaria's fingers.
[123:14.06]You obtained proof of the covenant.
[123:17.16]Relocate attributes.
[123:19.96]The price of rebirth is paid in pale tongues.
[123:21.48]Rebirth can be performed five more times during this lifetime.
[123:23.94]Do you wish to be reborn?
[123:27.14]So you think I should do 40, 40, 40?
[123:27.84]Okay.
[123:28.18]Okay.
[123:53.41]Okay, I can do 40, 40, 40.
[124:03.95]I think I'm okay with 40, 40, 40, and then points and strength, right?
[124:08.55]I can't.
[124:11.54]I can fuck it up and do it again.
[124:12.48]Okay.
[124:14.92]Thought you wanted strength.
[124:15.92]I don't know.
[124:16.36]I'm scared to do that.
[124:30.45]Ah, strength.
[124:31.19]Everyone's like, strength.
[124:32.23]You want me to do strength?
[124:37.23]And use those psycho swords?
[124:40.33]Double swords.
[124:41.01]I kind of do want to use those.
[124:42.49]They look like fun.
[124:44.35]They did look fun.
[124:46.91]How much, um... You said yourself, why would anyone go with this dex build?
[125:08.56]Beat the bosses with their all strength and nothing else.
[125:13.39]How much dexterity do I need to put on those dual swords?
[125:19.19]I'm going to cancel this for a second.
[125:21.35]I need to see what the actual attributes are.
[125:28.63]To use this insane thing.
[125:30.03]So it's 40, 15.
[125:30.33]40, 40 is required.
[125:30.93]40, 15.
[125:40.01]So we're going to put 15 into decks just to have it.
[125:42.16]I love when a message is right there and they think you want to read the fucking message.
[125:51.04]Just talk.
[125:51.78]No, like fucking talk, please.
[125:54.64]Please.
[125:54.94]So let's get the required shit here.
[126:04.96]15 decks.
[126:06.96]I can't even go lower than 16.
[126:10.40]Oh, wait a minute, because I have that home on.
[126:13.60]I have, like, items on that are giving me dexterity.
[126:23.59]Okay.
[126:25.51]Let's do this again.
[126:26.23]99 strength and 99 luck.
[126:36.60]Wait, why is it doing that to me?
[126:45.41]Everything into Charisma.
[126:53.81]So, how many points do I have left?
[126:54.83]What do you think?
[126:57.13]Get some points in vitality?
[127:01.75]I think I'm okay with that.
[127:02.91]For the extra load.
[127:09.38]Okay, base class.
[127:10.28]Alright, I'm just making sure.
[127:13.32]Alright, I think this list goes 40-40.
[127:14.94]A couple points in vitality and 40 strength.
[127:18.15]I think that's what I want.
[127:19.01]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[127:24.19]Get some vitality.
[127:25.61]How much vitality do you think I should have?
[127:27.71]More than... I can put points into it from now on.
[127:32.98]Maybe I should drop this down to 38-38 and go with like 17.
[127:34.68]Alright, I'm going to go with 15-39-39.
[127:46.21]I can always cap these at 40.
[127:47.83]That's what I'm going to do.
[127:49.34]That's what's going to happen.
[127:50.22]Here we go.
[127:50.56]That's what's going to happen.
[127:57.30]Alright.
[127:58.22]I'm going to do this.
[127:59.94]38, 38, 17, 40.
[128:00.36]Confirm.
[128:00.76]Stop.
[128:04.61]Alright.
[128:11.57]Now let's play the game with a strength weapon.
[128:14.51]Let's put it on.
[128:17.52]There they are.
[128:18.48]The ringed knight paired greatswords.
[128:24.80]Oh, damn.
[128:28.08]Two-handed.
[128:32.70]These things are bulky, man.
[128:36.18]Oh, wow.
[128:40.60]So what's the weapon art is this.
[128:44.60]Okay.
[128:46.28]Cool.
[128:48.36]So L1 is with both weapons.
[128:55.47]Alright.
[128:58.75]This kind of sucks!
[129:04.86]I'm going back to dexterity!
[129:07.08]No, no.
[129:08.08]We have to try.
[129:09.36]We have to try it.
[129:18.69]Where's the realism?
[129:21.19]We have to upgrade this weapon.
[129:27.47]Remove the shield and go all the way?
[129:28.77]Yeah, I could do that.
[129:29.70]It'd be fun.
[129:35.28]Let's do it.
[129:35.78]Okay.
[129:42.25]Oh, that's cool.
[129:43.53]So you go, like, bang, wham, wham.
[129:47.45]Okay.
[129:47.67]It takes a lot of weapon art, though.
[129:52.79]The carry weight.
[129:54.05]Yeah.
[129:55.67]Holy shit, I'm, like, fat rolling.
[129:59.45]Yikes.
[130:04.04]Where is that?
[130:05.00]Zorb HP from each defeated foe.
[130:07.76]That's kind of good.
[130:11.59]Moose attack.
[130:12.39]Slightly boost.
[130:12.99]Okay, so which one do I want?
[130:15.57]What do I want for a ring now?
[130:19.69]Stamina recovery speed?
[130:20.63]I feel like that would be pretty good.
[130:27.03]And then pretty much whatever I want.
[130:33.99]Greatly boost pyromancies.
[130:45.72]Go get Havel's Ring.
[130:46.78]I don't even know what the hell that is.
[130:56.14]Alright, we're just gonna go with, like, this one for now.
[131:00.86]Alright, level me up.
[131:07.06]Reinforce.
[131:10.22]Hopefully I have enough to do this.
[131:15.21]go for it two three four and bang maximum infuse can I I can't infuse it right no these are maxed out 322 plus 205 that's actually pretty crazy
[131:42.14]I might have to take these pants off.
[131:44.90]I don't know.
[131:47.46]I gotta drop this down to... What?
[131:50.54]Like 38?
[131:53.43]35 or something?
[131:53.83]Get rid of this shield.
[132:01.29]Nope.
[132:05.15]Hmm.
[132:10.82]I need to get Havel's Ring.
[132:11.84]Hmm.
[132:14.54]Where is Havel's Ring?
[132:15.84]I don't know where Havel's Ring is.
[132:22.56]In the meantime, I'm gonna have to put on something, like, a little lighter than this.
[132:29.21]What do I got?
[132:36.49]What's that?
[132:36.95]Come on.
[132:38.09]There we go.
[132:38.65]Okay.
[132:41.31]Well, let's just give it a try.
[132:53.30]I just want to see how these weapons work.
[132:56.79]It's in the swamp I was panicking in.
[133:00.01]Well, let me just go from here.
[133:08.61]The plus three ring is in the DLC.
[133:09.76]Alright, well, whatever.
[133:11.80]It's always looking for me.
[133:12.52]It's always next time, right?
[133:14.40]Always next year.
[133:16.02]Oh, whoops.
[133:19.08]Whoops.
[133:27.30]Have I killed the demon miniboss in Farron Keep?
[133:31.54]Oh god, I don't remember.
[133:33.38]That was like a year ago that I played this character.
[133:36.95]In that area.
[133:40.81]Let's just give this a try.
[133:41.67]I've got my dual weapons.
[133:44.51]I've got my super swords now.
[133:50.86]I kind of have souls that I shouldn't really have.
[133:55.89]I should have bought some stuff, but whatever.
[134:00.23]Need to see what's over here.
[134:01.47]I have to be getting fairly close, right?
[134:06.60]Or am I there?
[134:08.20]It's possible.
[134:16.43]Is that a person or a painting?
[134:19.87]Is it a cracked eggshell?
[134:26.60]Is she alive?
[134:27.12]This person's alive.
[134:42.58]I'm scared of this.
[134:43.20]Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg.
[134:48.83]Well, I don't know what that does.
[134:51.93]I'm terrified of what that does.
[134:55.62]I need to go hit somebody with this to even know how to use this move.
[135:00.36]And I sent it back down.
[135:03.55]Wait, why is everybody freaking out?
[135:05.03]What's going on here?
[135:08.73]No, no, no, no.
[135:09.65]Good job.
[135:12.43]Why is everybody freaking out about this?
[135:18.78]Do I have to kill the dragon first or something?
[135:20.58]Am I missing out on an item or a thing?
[135:23.48]You know, whatever.
[135:28.87]Oh, you can't fight the dragon if you do that.
[135:30.77]I got you.
[135:33.51]Okay.
[135:41.85]Let's see how much damage I do.
[135:44.31]Per swing now.
[135:46.61]With my new weapons.
[135:58.27]We'll give it a go.
[135:59.67]Let's go fight Dragon Man again.
[136:01.23]The one thing that's tough, though, is I'm not used to how slow Strength is.
[136:07.83]I've been playing the whole game with the Dex character, and the other part, the other time I played the game was with the Sorcery character.
[136:14.95]So, you know, I'm gonna be a little getting used to it.
[136:19.00]I'm going to fight one of the hard bosses.
[136:21.58]Wish me luck.
[136:24.42]Um... Wait.
[136:28.10]Okay, hold on.
[136:28.68]I went the wrong way.
[136:29.24]I have to jump through the thing.
[136:36.64]You still fight the dragon after?
[136:37.66]So why?
[136:37.92]Why is everybody saying not to do that?
[136:38.98]Run this side.
[136:44.13]I hope so.
[136:47.75]Whatever.
[136:48.09]Run this side.
[136:51.05]Which side is the damn thing on?
[136:52.19]It's right there.
[136:52.83]Oh, come on.
[136:57.11]Just go, please.
[136:58.63]Get me in this stupid door.
[136:59.93]So I can fight the dragon.
[137:12.66]Don't listen to them.
[137:13.98]Am I even going?
[137:14.60]I forget even where this is.
[137:15.80]It's this way, right?
[137:18.38]You fall down the hole.
[137:21.76]Is the hole in the middle?
[137:22.56]Yeah.
[137:24.36]Alright, let's go, dragon.
[137:28.05]They want you to rage?
[137:31.33]Well... Probably will.
[137:38.66]Hey, dragon!
[137:49.97]Stop moving!
[137:50.81]Stop moving!
[138:05.35]Oh shit.
[138:10.17]This is actually gonna take some getting used to.
[138:15.14]It is.
[138:15.36]It's okay.
[138:19.90]I gotta get like one cannon and then leave.
[138:24.75]I gotta be smart about it.
[138:30.06]That hitbox actually touched me.
[138:34.70]I'm a little slow at the moment.
[138:37.88]Can I like chop his tail off like in the other Dark Souls game?
[139:03.79]I'm going against everything I should have gone down.
[139:10.69]Oh shit.
[139:11.15]Look who this guy is.
[139:15.66]This guy is insane.
[139:17.62]He has so much health.
[139:23.46]I think I can get this guy.
[139:24.72]I really do.
[139:25.04]I think I... I got a couple more attempts.
[139:32.12]I think I got this.
[139:32.82]It's just going to take time.
[139:33.68]I can't be fucked up.
[139:38.34]I'm not going to suck a bad idea.
[139:42.60]I love how you kick when you don't want to kick.
[139:47.47]Thank you.
[139:47.83]I love pressing L1 and up and including the kick.
[139:50.05]Great.
[139:51.43]That's just great.
[139:53.25]I love that so much.
[140:07.10]That weapon art just did it.
[140:07.96]180 damage.
[140:09.02]And it took 3 seconds to charge up.
[140:15.08]That's not worth doing.
[140:24.13]Uh... So the sword art does less damage than a regular swing.
[140:34.68]I think that's because I don't have any...
[140:37.58]Like, fire damage?
[140:40.54]Strength is a mistake.
[140:45.32]I'm gonna try that again.
[140:48.38]I don't fucking... Got out of my way.
[140:56.21]You were doing better with the katana?
[140:57.45]Yeah, I was.
[140:59.61]I definitely was.
[141:00.39]Oh, well.
[141:08.25]Regular... I just... I gotta just play it smart.
[141:11.55]And hit him in the head.
[141:12.61]This is gonna take a while, but I'm just gonna be quiet.
[141:14.88]I'm gonna play Dark Souls 3.
[141:16.92]I'm gonna try to slowly but surely kill this boss.
[141:22.02]Turn the music up.
[141:23.12]Okay.
[141:24.78]Uh... See if that does anything for you.
[141:29.01]And... Taking unnecessary damage.
[141:32.07]As I hit circle.
[141:32.65]Circle.
[141:36.57]Quick, use the fire sword on the creature that breathes fire and has fire burning inside of him.
[141:45.07]Let's go.
[141:45.53]I also really should take those blossoms, too.
[141:49.33]Those would help.
[142:01.73]I didn't even do animation
[142:33.32]Hit its head?
[142:33.84]Well, that's easier said than done.
[142:36.62]When he does like seven swings in a row.
[142:41.71]Dude swings like five times in a row and they're hard to dodge.
[142:46.69]I went the wrong way again.
[142:48.41]If I do that again, I'm going to smash my head into my desk.
[142:54.60]Just like...
[142:59.88]let's do a strength build guys no no no I gotta we gotta do this right we're gonna do this right green blossom let's do a strength build I it's it'll be okay we're gonna have like our emergencies here right
[143:24.98]These are all super emergencies in the case that, you know, whatever.
[143:30.44]It really might be easier with a dex build.
[143:33.24]Yeah, but it's okay.
[143:35.61]We're gonna Ember.
[143:39.75]We're gonna try this again.
[143:42.75]I'm going for gold.
[143:51.87]First time using a new build on a super secret endgame boss.
[143:55.37]Yeah, but it's okay.
[144:01.33]The real sad part about fighting this is... It's gonna be real... It's gonna be real sad.
[144:07.96]If I get him down to like 10% and I die.
[144:09.84]Like that, it just takes so long.
[144:11.20]He has so much health.
[144:12.18]There we go.
[144:17.18]Solid attempt.
[144:17.72]Let's go.
[144:31.51]I gotta stay near him.
[144:32.99]Right underneath him.
[144:52.42]Shit.
[144:52.64]I gotta pay attention to that.
[145:10.24]Hello!
[145:27.31]What's going on, dude?
[145:52.80]tail right oh I'm in trouble
[146:19.07]Oh, man.
[146:24.02]Oh, I thought he was... Try the weapon art.
[146:27.68]The weapon art does not do any damage at all.
[146:29.08]It does, like, 180 damage.
[146:30.48]And I can try to hit him, like, right in the face, but that's going to be so hard.
[146:35.55]I mean, just for shit's sake, try it.
[146:48.38]30.
[146:48.42]Let's see if I can get it again.
[146:49.84]300.
[146:56.45]That's just really unreliable to try to get him to face me back.
[147:02.11]And I'm too close too.
[147:02.99]You know, here's the tactic.
[147:04.06]You've got to hit him once and then run away.
[147:06.18]The opportunity is bad.
[147:12.04]It's ridiculous every time.
[147:28.18]This is extremely difficult.
[147:35.77]If he didn't have so much health, this might not be that bad.
[147:37.69]If only I had a shotgun, yeah.
[147:41.71]If only he didn't have 30,000 HP.
[147:47.27]This is definitely not doing me any favors, unfortunately.
[147:49.49]These weapons are really not that good.
[147:54.43]It's too slow.
[148:00.81]I think I would rather have a dex build and be able to swing and move.
[148:06.44]We'll do like another one or two attempts on this guy.
[148:08.68]Just see if I can get him any further.
[148:09.82]Do I have anything else that's strength?
[148:18.58]Wouldn't be any good.
[148:23.63]Ring knight, straight sword.
[148:25.89]Just see what this is like.
[148:32.58]I mean, this thing is kind of fast and good.
[148:42.09]Should I level this up, you think?
[148:48.26]I have two more slabs.
[148:52.27]I think I'm going to try this.
[148:53.93]We'll level this up.
[148:54.53]Where the hell am I going here?
[149:06.67]The ring knight sword is good.
[149:12.18]Well, in that case...
[149:16.58]Do a quality build.
[149:24.10]Is this faster or slower, this swing here?
[149:25.88]This is too slow.
[149:35.16]Hmm.
[149:47.31]follower javelin?
[149:50.03]Should I just level up the javelin and just like stab him?
[149:57.80]Why do I like this idea?
[150:04.20]You know, why do I like this?
[150:12.81]You guys want me to beat the hardest boss in Dark Souls 3 with the follower javelin?
[150:23.38]Throw spears at him.
[150:25.86]I'm doing it.
[150:26.46]Fuck this.
[150:27.28]I don't even care anymore.
[150:28.58]I'm buffing.
[150:29.22]I'm using a Titanite Slab on this.
[150:32.95]I don't care.
[150:39.13]We're doing it.
[150:44.14]You guys think I'm fucking around right now?
[150:47.04]No way.
[150:49.18]Strength.
[150:50.60]We're just going to level this up.
[150:57.96]Here we go.
[150:58.40]I don't have any souls.
[151:06.40]Take it to plus nine.
[151:12.25]Respect the luck, dude.
[151:13.87]I'm going to give this a try.
[151:15.05]I want to.
[151:17.65]I want to do this.
[151:20.81]For shits.
[151:21.81]And use a heavy gem on it.
[151:28.04]Do I have anything to, like, crush or sell?
[151:31.04]Sell something.
[151:34.84]Sell this dumb repair powder.
[151:36.04]And, like, these stupid bug shit.
[151:38.48]I don't even want them.
[151:42.73]Um, what else can I sell that I don't want?
[151:44.33]Hmm.
[151:51.37]Sell, like, all these spells.
[151:52.55]Like, who needs these?
[151:53.15]I'm not even gonna use them ever.
[151:56.57]Like, frozen weapon.
[151:57.53]Who cares?
[151:57.99]What am I going to get?
[151:58.47]Soul Stream?
[151:59.05]When am I ever going to use this?
[152:03.83]We're going... This is the weapon that you pick up after your second quest in World of Warcraft.
[152:11.58]I'm using this weapon.
[152:14.92]I mean, if you guys want a joke stream, this is what you're going to get.
[152:20.82]Follower Javelin.
[152:22.36]Let's do it.
[152:37.47]It's about to be B in strength, by the way.
[152:39.53]I could just spec into sorcery.
[152:46.74]Well, I don't need to do that.
[152:47.66]I have a level 95 sorcerer.
[152:55.26]Get rid of this lightning strike.
[152:56.90]Wrath of the gods.
[152:58.75]Who cares?
[153:00.97]All this fire stuff.
[153:01.93]Power within.
[153:02.65]I don't need that.
[153:05.31]Ashen one.
[153:11.36]This will bring it to plus nine.
[153:16.78]And... I did it!
[153:26.07]I actually did it.
[153:26.75]Mm-hmm.
[153:31.89]And I'm putting a heavy gem in it.
[153:33.03]Oh.
[153:43.89]And we're doing heavy gem.
[153:48.48]How much did I need?
[153:49.00]I don't even know.
[153:52.36]I have a sorcerer with all this stuff.
[153:54.26]It doesn't matter.
[153:54.82]It's okay.
[153:56.62]I have a faith character too.
[154:00.05]I face when Jerma sells all of his spells to level up the follower javelin.
[154:14.96]Alright, here we go.
[154:16.02]That actually increases it by quite a lot.
[154:25.25]It's done.
[154:28.09]It's time to use the fucking spear.
[154:40.00]We're using the fucking level 30 green from World of Warcraft.
[154:50.37]Let's put on some better armor.
[154:51.71]Yeah.
[154:51.85]Alright, let's get some fire here.
[154:57.86]Fire, fire, fire, fire.
[155:03.88]Jailor Robe actually is pretty okay.
[155:06.06]But he does a lot of physical damage too.
[155:12.22]I'm still rolling.
[155:14.97]With this on.
[155:21.21]Alright.
[155:22.87]We are golden.
[155:26.40]70%, right?
[155:34.00]Watch this be the thing I needed to do.
[155:36.32]Watch me, like, kick his ass right now.
[155:39.07]I would laugh.
[155:43.53]Full-on chicken night.
[155:54.09]Uh, fire.
[155:54.75]Those are actually great.
[156:00.15]Uh, this is better.
[156:01.87]Ah, it's 71%.
[156:02.51]There we go.
[156:05.95]Okay.
[156:10.26]Here we go.
[156:14.84]I'm ready.
[156:22.20]Let's give it a try.
[156:23.44]Why not?
[156:27.53]Chicken spear.
[156:38.96]Chicken spear.
[156:39.34]Make sure I got everything else.
[156:40.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[156:42.70]Take this off.
[156:43.58]Do I have a fire resistance ring?
[156:49.10]Poison, bleed, curse.
[156:52.15]Gradually stores HP.
[156:55.09]Curse, frost, poison, bleed.
[156:59.98]I don't have a... Fire one?
[157:05.06]Meh.
[157:17.81]I don't know.
[157:18.17]What should I even put on here?
[157:24.95]Just increases dexterity?
[157:26.21]Like, who cares?
[157:31.58]Thrust weapon counterattacks.
[157:37.68]I think I just want to do an attempt and forget it.
[157:40.04]Put on increase intelligence.
[157:48.51]No, fuck it.
[157:49.43]Whatever.
[157:49.71]Let me look in here, though.
[158:01.39]I don't think I have anything in here.
[158:02.55]No rings, I don't think.
[158:14.02]No.
[158:14.16]I'm just going to go for an attempt.
[158:15.86]Just to see if this is even worth doing.
[158:17.16]Let's put on the life ring or something.
[158:21.80]Who cares?
[158:22.20]Doesn't even matter.
[158:22.96]Who cares?
[158:27.02]Put on increased intelligence so you know how to switch the build off.
[158:31.35]Game almost just crashed, but it's okay.
[158:38.29]Yeah.
[158:39.03]Just wait till you guys read in the newspapers tomorrow.
[158:43.03]StreamerJerma985.
[158:45.41]Kills hardest boss in Dark Souls with a plus 10 follower javelin.
[158:58.03]Make sure I have this shit on my bar.
[159:03.06]Lightning... Can I actually make this lightning?
[159:06.61]I can.
[159:07.13]Alright.
[159:08.71]This is it!
[159:10.05]Here we go!
[159:10.47]Let's do it!
[159:36.85]Wow!
[159:38.85]That's so good.
[159:44.17]Y'all didn't think I had the fucking strategy.
[159:49.35]I'm so worked up right now.
[159:50.95]This is gonna work.
[159:52.91]I'm wicked worked up.
[159:57.03]I gotta calm down.
[159:57.93]My heart is beating now.
[159:58.81]This is gonna work.
[160:14.71]I just have to hit him in the head.
[160:16.53]I just have to do that like over and over again.
[160:20.42]Just run the fuck away.
[160:21.40]Oh, come on.
[160:27.79]Dude, that move happened so quick.
[160:30.43]I don't know if I'll ever dodge it.
[160:50.88]This might not have been a great idea.
[161:04.46]Just chuck them at him.
[161:19.52]I'm out of, like, Estus' though.
[161:28.19]Alright, maybe if I just, like, calm down here.
[161:30.05]Gotta just aim the camera now.
[161:57.64]There we go again.
[162:06.69]The range is so short.
[162:13.69]Why did I ever take off dexterity?
[162:17.53]Don't ask me why.
[162:21.27]I'm never going to reach his face, dude.
[162:24.35]That's never going to happen.
[162:29.18]I'm too busy trying, like, my range to try to hit him is three inches in front of me.
[162:37.27]This guy is so unbearable that, like, you have to do this with a dex weapon.
[162:50.13]Just kill me, this is awful.
[163:03.83]We're going back.
[163:11.52]I'm gonna do one more attempt with the actual swords.
[163:20.17]The things that I actually was going to use.
[163:21.90]These things.
[163:23.12]Except no, I have way too much now.
[163:32.74]We, uh... I'm going back to dex.
[163:38.33]I'm going back to dexterity.
[163:43.53]Was that lady's room?
[163:50.71]The katana is faster, I can move around easier.
[164:02.04]Use the crow quills?
[164:02.78]I don't even have the crow quills.
[164:09.48]We're doing a re-respec.
[164:14.84]He used two slabs for this joke.
[164:16.60]I know.
[164:20.04]I know.
[164:25.23]40.
[164:26.41]Get this up to, like, 40.
[164:29.15]Hey, it was fun, though.
[164:36.70]Wait.
[164:37.14]Hold on.
[164:41.22]The funniest part about this is if I just kept attempting to do this boss with, like, the katana that I've been used to, I may have gotten him down, like, low enough where I was comfortable.
[164:53.08]Where's the uchi katana?
[164:57.02]16 and 11.
[164:58.30]Okay.
[165:03.63]11 strength.
[165:08.47]Chat tricked him to fight the dragon first.
[165:13.84]Hey, it was fun while it lasted.
[165:16.38]I wanted to try it, right?
[165:28.14]How's that look?
[165:28.82]40, 40, 40, 18, 40.
[165:32.76]That's what we're doing.
[165:39.52]What did you do to my Jeremy?
[165:42.16]There it is.
[165:43.12]Chat tricked him to respec 15 times.
[165:48.18]Always have vitality now.
[165:51.42]Oh, there's the katana.
[165:52.32]Can I just keep this stuff on?
[165:55.16]Ooh, I can.
[166:00.95]A shameful 11 strength.
[166:02.21]Not enough strength to wield a katana.
[166:03.28]Yeah, it is.
[166:04.32]I need 11.
[166:06.36]Yes, I am.
[166:06.76]I'm strong enough.
[166:07.22]What are you talking about?
[166:08.42]What are you guys on about?
[166:15.32]What are you guys talking about?
[166:19.05]Hey, where's my emote, by the way?
[166:22.63]I want my new emote.
[166:29.07]We're going here.
[166:33.99]Blame chat, not the dumb streamer.
[166:35.73]It's all chat's fault.
[166:41.20]Let's try to get him to half health.
[166:42.94]If I can do that, I'll be happy.
[166:50.54]Uh, this way.
[166:55.86]Let's pull the lever here.
[166:59.30]It's jermaMars, is the new one.
[167:05.98]Yes, right away.
[167:13.51]If I can first try, attempt to get this with the katana.
[167:15.69]Have I did?
[167:16.21]Okay, let's be real.
[167:18.49]Have I actually even attempted to fight this boss with the katana?
[167:23.85]I don't think I have.
[167:25.77]I got here, I walked up to him, and he killed me.
[167:27.37]I don't think I actually have fought him with a katana.
[167:31.20]Here we go.
[167:31.74]Yeah, the full chicken costume.
[167:36.76]This boss drops a sick katana.
[167:41.05]Alright, here we go.
[167:44.51]Let's try an attack.
[167:47.32]I really don't know.
[168:09.55]Why did I ever take this over?
[168:14.44]Shit.
[168:37.98]Fire.
[168:40.25]I gotta look at the ground.
[168:48.07]Ooh.
[168:49.19]That hurt.
[168:55.35]That.
[168:56.85]Run forward.
[168:57.41]Run, run, run, run, run.
[168:58.57]No shit.
[169:00.02]I don't understand how to dodge that.
[169:01.36]I really don't.
[169:02.44]How do you dodge that shit?
[169:15.14]Let's pop ourselves off here.
[169:41.82]Yo, he's flying back.
[169:42.50]I don't know what this is.
[169:43.82]Okay, is that...?
[169:45.64]How was I supposed to dodge that, not even knowing what was happening?
[169:50.33]I'm getting full.
[169:57.39]It swings in, like, every single fucking direction.
[170:02.61]I'm actually angry right now.
[170:04.45]This is stupid.
[170:28.16]Don't, uh, don't dash!
[170:29.22]Don't dash!
[170:29.64]Don't do it!
[170:30.00]You're gonna do it!
[170:30.56]You're gonna do it!
[170:31.00]You're gonna do it!
[170:50.45]That was so lucky.
[171:08.45]That move is so dumb.
[171:20.52]Maybe y'all know it.
[171:22.38]That move is fucking dumb.
[171:26.22]That shit is dumb.
[171:28.79]It's just dumb.
[171:29.71]Even if you dodge through it, it's just so stupid.
[171:44.41]That explosion is fucking massive!
[171:53.53]Well, that attempt was better, but, like... You remove that stupid second purple explosion... And this guy's really not that bad.
[172:06.08]I think... I think I can do this.
[172:12.26]I'm gonna Ember up.
[172:17.08]I'm going to be ready.
[172:17.78]I'm going to do this shit.
[172:23.21]The music's distracting me now.
[172:24.49]I wouldn't be surprised.
[172:27.27]Almost kind of halfway there.
[172:28.37]That's true.
[172:32.05]I do need more lightning.
[172:32.95]I'm good on armor.
[172:41.55]I'm doing okay.
[172:48.98]If this dude has a second phase... I might actually throw up.
[172:55.17]You might see... I'll turn the camera on for it.
[172:56.71]I'll make sure.
[173:00.19]I will actually do that on stream.
[173:01.32]I'll puke on stream if this guy has a second phase.
[173:23.52]I'm just getting so screwed right now.
[173:29.62]That is such poor shit.
[174:09.88]Get one and I'll just lighten him out now.
[174:36.42]Shit, fire, fuck.
[174:37.38]I wasn't ready for it.
[174:39.66]I'm doing it again.
[174:45.20]Give me a fucking break.
[174:52.57]I'm so angry.
[174:53.93]I can't get over it.
[175:14.70]Oh, hi.
[175:15.96]Breath of the Wild isn't even out yet.
[175:18.00]I'm dead.
[175:18.42]Great.
[175:18.58]That's not an instant kill move.
[175:23.84]Okay.
[175:24.28]This is a wash attempt, no?
[175:43.82]Is that happening?
[175:46.12]Maybe if I say that again, I will get the prank.
[175:52.00]I can't.
[175:57.47]I can't.
[175:58.15]This is a wash.
[175:59.99]Just kill me.
[176:04.18]Just fucking kill me, I'm done.
[176:06.58]Oh god, why did you just do that?
[176:08.72]Oh my god.
[176:09.80]What the fuck was that?
[176:13.48]Why?
[176:14.48]Why?
[176:14.88]Why?
[176:17.66]My ears, my brain, chat's ears, everybody's head.
[176:20.78]This ware jar broke.
[176:26.49]I didn't, I really didn't think that that would happen, sorry.
[176:31.15]Jesus, tap dancing, goodness.
[176:33.87]All the money!
[176:35.56]All the bits!
[176:37.98]They're all gone.
[176:38.72]I'm sorry, I broke the jar.
[176:44.73]Oh, and he killed me.
[176:46.00]He beat me.
[176:46.62]He beat me.
[176:47.10]He beat me.
[176:47.52]He beat me.
[176:47.78]Alright, this is my last attempt and I'm gonna end the stream.
[176:52.32]I gotta take a break.
[176:56.92]I gotta take a break.
[177:02.60]I'm gonna clean up all the bits.
[177:08.07]You mad at me?
[177:09.83]No.
[177:11.57]Why would I be mad?
[177:12.31]Because you dropped coins on the ground?
[177:15.63]thought you did it on purpose at first I was like oh my god I thought like you saw me get killed and you were like oh this I thought you just spiked it into the ground
[177:45.19]That animation is so crazy.
[177:48.35]Ah, this might be a watch too.
[177:49.59]I might just do it again.
[177:56.07]Maybe.
[177:56.35]If I get my act together, maybe it won't be.
[178:05.78]Not thinking very much.
[178:07.02]I did the thing where I wanted to walk forward and I pressed the button in.
[178:24.82]You had a sorcery build character, and it was not very fun.
[178:28.50]I can imagine no character is fun against this boss.
[178:31.76]Because he's unbearable.
[178:37.72]I went the wrong way.
[178:38.30]Alright, this is the really, really real last attempt.
[178:42.87]And then I'm gonna take off.
[178:54.68]Crying violin music.
[178:55.82]I have to slam my head on my desk.
[179:11.36]Yeah, I do.
[179:16.00]Hey, Germans.
[179:17.02]I didn't get to see it.
[179:17.86]It's gone.
[179:24.10]It's easy for the strength.
[179:25.12]Yeah, maybe I should go do a strength build again.
[179:34.69]Alright, come on.
[179:35.63]Let's go.
[179:36.15]This is my last shot.
[179:37.05]This is my last attempt.
[179:42.08]I'm doing a dumb move back to back.
[179:57.35]Let's see where he is.
[180:03.50]He cares about the souls.
[180:06.04]I can't do that to you.
[180:13.99]Right when I come in.
[180:20.75]I didn't have that.
[180:29.58]The next seal is going to be an ember, but it didn't.
[181:02.13]Oh, take it, take it, please, please.
[181:06.81]Oh, he's really up.
[181:23.58]See, it's okay.
[181:25.26]Not quite, not quite.
[181:33.73]You just gotta get the hell away from him.
[181:37.16]He's way far away.
[181:39.54]Of course, the fucking 5 billion damage deal.
[181:42.36]Jesus, there's no smoke at me at the moment.
[182:17.25]I'm losing my mojo here.
[182:30.95]I'm jumping out my window.
[182:32.88]We're doing a window jump, like, I'm dropping like a quarter, a tenth of a story.
[182:38.00]Like six, like four feet.
[182:39.20]And then run to my back, and just be like, eh!
[182:53.73]Yeah.
[182:53.87]I might get him for like half health, yeah.
[182:58.45]Yeah.
[183:22.71]Well thanks everybody for watching You all have a great day I ain't living past this next 30 seconds I got him closer than before though Somehow
[183:59.69]Alright.
[184:03.25]That's it.
[184:04.25]I'm out of here.
[184:07.67]There's only so much punishment I think my brain can take.
[184:11.68]We'll do this tomorrow.
[184:12.86]I'll see you guys.
[184:13.23]I'm going to stream early tomorrow.
[184:15.07]Probably around like... Somewhere in the early afternoon.
[184:20.53]Probably somewhere around like 11, 12 maybe.
[184:23.35]Like 1-ish.
[184:26.04]And I... Yeah.
[184:30.20]Thanks everybody for watching.

[184:49.49]I will beat him tomorrow.
[184:52.23]I'm going to do a couple other things off stream tomorrow.
