[00:58.80]I'm living in hell right now, guys.
[01:03.44]If I get a PS3 hell, this is hell.
[01:07.91]Would you like to see what hell looks like?
[01:09.55]Give me one second.
[01:12.37]Give me a minute.
[01:12.91]I'm starting in a minute.
[01:13.65]Hold on.
[02:05.96]I've been living this, I've been living this for the last, like, two hours.
[02:10.86]I've been trying desperately to get this fucking thing to work.
[02:14.39]And it won't.
[02:15.43]So, you know, and I can't, what am I going to do, return it?
[02:18.35]No.
[02:19.91]We're going to live on stream, like, shit on this thing.
[02:24.72]Whatever the hell it is.
[02:27.54]Hold on a minute.
[02:28.42]Let me try one more time.
[02:30.14]We're a minute early.
[03:29.97]Okay, so let's let's move this over to you're gonna see my fucking ugly bug in a second hold on I Wonder what the last thing was that was recorded was find out Or a the sensors are perfectly safe
[03:45.66]This has been my life.
[03:47.66]Want to ride on the fucking skateboard.
[03:53.32]But it won't calibrate.
[03:54.42]It didn't get it.
[03:56.56]Didn't quite get that.
[03:57.88]Didn't quite get it.
[03:58.60]Let's try this one.
[03:59.44]Stand in the green zones.
[04:00.76]My room just might be too small.
[04:02.32]Okay, now make sure not to touch the board until the countdown ends.
[04:11.42]No, and that's not a fucking, like, that's not a fucking person over there, like, bundled up.
[04:15.65]Your sensors are going to be super calibrated in a bit.
[04:18.69]This is probably the easiest thing you'll ever do.
[04:20.49]Okay, this is the easiest thing you've had to do.
[04:22.43]Here we go, we're almost there.
[04:23.75]Ah, we didn't quite get that.
[04:28.59]Stand in one of these safe zones away from the side sensors.
[04:32.27]Okay, now make sure not to touch the board for the next 15 seconds.
[04:36.15]Here we go.
[04:38.28]Okay, now make sure not to touch the board until the countdown.
[04:42.46]Don't worry, the sensors are perfectly safe.
[04:44.77]And I can't skip it either.
[04:45.93]There's no skipping this.
[04:48.83]This is probably the easiest thing you'll do all day.
[04:51.44]I fucking broke it.
[04:55.28]Alright, well, you know what?
[04:57.58]We're gonna go like this.
[04:59.58]Hi, guys!
[05:00.54]Hey, how are you?
[05:01.36]How's everything going?
[05:03.59]God.
[05:04.45]I fucking knew this was gonna happen.
[05:06.15]I didn't secure this well enough.
[05:07.61]Get over here, you fucking piece of shit.
[05:09.41]Of course, now.
[05:09.83]Now it doesn't want to stay there.
[05:11.85]Oh, my God.
[05:12.61]What a fucking joke.
[05:13.69]Got it.
[05:23.96]I had it, like, taped up too.
[05:25.22]You know what, fuck, we're just gonna leave it here for a second.
[05:26.82]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna... Hey, how you doing?
[05:28.78]Welcome to the stream.
[05:29.54]Good to see you.
[05:30.92]You see this fucking thing?
[05:32.18]Oh, whoa!
[05:33.18]Look at this, Tony Hawk!
[05:36.07]Watch this one.
[05:37.67]Oh, kickflip, huh?
[05:39.31]Oh, whoa, cool!
[05:42.35]The thing doesn't even work.
[05:44.49]It doesn't fucking work.
[05:45.67]Those sensors are going to be super calibrated in a bit.
[05:48.75]This is probably the easiest thing you'll do all day.
[05:55.03]Didn't quite get it.
[05:56.24]Let's try again.
[05:58.46]The bass just filled the house.
[06:01.00]Did I think I was actually going to be able to do that?
[06:06.26]Oh, my God.
[06:06.76]I felt that.
[06:07.80]I felt that in the fucking foundation.
[06:09.72]Alright.
[06:11.22]Hold on a minute.
[06:12.99]Now it should be calibrated, right?
[06:16.11]Okay.
[06:17.03]What do you know?
[06:19.23]15 seconds.
[06:19.59]Let's try it one last time.
[06:21.45]Almost there.
[06:22.71]Got it.
[06:24.79]We didn't quite get it.
[06:25.85]I'm not doing anything.
[06:26.97]I'm in a safe zone.
[06:27.61]Maybe because I kneed it in the fucking chest, maybe it'll work now.
[06:30.92]I did the equivalent of kneeing this guy in the stomach.
[06:32.78]Put it sideways?
[06:33.44]What do you mean sideways?
[06:34.62]And tell me to face it towards the screen.
[06:36.62]Got it.
[06:54.74]We didn't quite get it.
[06:56.14]Let's try again.
[06:56.98]God, fuck this thing.
[06:57.98]Sensors are first.
[06:59.14]Stand in one of these... Give me a second.
[07:00.60]Okay, now make sure not to touch... Let's go.
[07:15.48]Let's play the game I was gonna play.
[07:22.93]This is the fucking easiest thing you'll do all day, apparently.
[07:25.83]It's alright.
[07:27.31]We got like five... No, no, the stream's going fine.
[07:30.27]We got like... We got like fucking seven other games to play.
[07:33.95]We're gonna be fine.
[07:41.58]Don't worry.
[07:42.26]We're gonna play God Hand.
[07:45.80]That's all rats ready to go, and that one probably works.
[07:50.65]Fucking calibrate.
[07:53.95]I'll calibrate my fucking fist into your face.
[07:57.63]How does that sound?
[08:00.93]Can't get calibrated.
[08:02.09]Alright, so.
[08:05.15]This is gonna work, okay.
[08:11.01]God Hand, I gotta change the thing to God Hand.
[08:14.01]My seat's not even in here.
[08:16.13]Let me go get my fucking seat.
[08:19.28]My knee hurts.
[08:31.06]I'm fired, what do you mean fired?
[08:32.44]Let's turn this back over here.
[08:39.20]That's fine.
[08:45.44]You can see the seething anger in my face.
[08:50.05]I got all dolled up to do a face cam.
[08:53.05]So I'm gonna do one.
[08:56.47]Is this even the right way?
[09:02.91]I don't know.
[09:07.71]Yeah, I gotta, like, flip it this way.
[09:12.53]Flip this way.
[09:13.19]There we go.
[09:13.83]Okay.
[09:15.51]Hi, guys.
[09:15.91]No, hold on.
[09:18.21]I fucked it up.
[09:18.66]Hold on.
[09:19.28]Give me one second.
[09:24.48]There we go.
[09:28.76]Okay.
[09:28.92]Let me plug my ears in.
[09:31.70]I got a lot of requests to play this game.
[09:33.08]So we're gonna play it.
[09:38.26]Just drop this in my fucking coffee.
[09:41.79]Get a close up of that mug?
[09:44.03]Which mug?
[09:44.43]I don't know what you're referring to.
[09:49.89]Anywho, let's first start, let's play God Hand.
[09:52.01]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, I gotta change this.
[09:57.38]Tony Hawk's Ride.
[09:58.68]There's so many chords on my lap.
[10:12.10]We good.
[10:13.28]New game.
[10:13.52]I'm going to tilt this back up so I can actually see it.
[10:18.11]Normal is fine.
[10:20.69]What did you expect from me?
[10:22.21]A normal difficulty?
[10:24.17]What are you, a dick?
[10:25.83]What are you, some kind of dick?
[10:28.13]Close up of the cup.
[10:28.83]You want to see how dirty this is?
[10:30.67]Oh, this is not even the right aspect ratio.
[10:32.06]Look at how fucking disgusting this coffee is.
[10:38.78]Can you see all the black shit in there?
[10:40.40]How bad this looks.
[10:41.78]It's alright, it's like a 4 out of 10 copy.
[10:46.74]Who made this game?
[11:08.70]Didn't, like, Hideo Kojima make this game?
[11:10.82]Somebody made this game that was, like, really, really popular, right?
[11:16.70]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[11:17.76]Hold on.
[11:18.36]Alright, hold on.
[11:22.19]Alright, so you hit square a bunch of times.
[11:25.15]What about X?
[11:26.01]Okay, X is kick.
[11:27.23]Alright, so you can do, like, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, kick.
[11:34.55]through the window.
[11:36.21]Was that supposed to happen?
[11:37.91]I guess this is like one of those funny games.
[11:39.27]Is there a block?
[11:44.25]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:46.35]I can't even press the tutorial button.
[11:49.21]Alright, tutorial.
[11:51.11]Use the right analog stick to evade enemy attacks.
[11:55.61]How do I change the camera?
[11:57.55]Oh, that's how.
[11:58.51]Apparently.
[11:59.55]Oh, well, that's... I didn't evade very well.
[12:03.76]I need the other tutorials!
[12:05.76]Where are they, like, where are they?
[12:07.66]Oh, shit.
[12:10.90]Why is everybody whistling at me?
[12:13.18]Triangle?
[12:13.62]Okay, triangle's like a different kick.
[12:16.22]So what?
[12:19.88]I'm assuming I can... Fuckin' just like Dark Souls, that's good.
[12:23.81]There aren't any camera controls?
[12:26.87]Oh, let's take this guy in the bank.
[12:30.74]Stinger!
[12:32.12]What button am I supposed to be pressing?
[12:33.20]I don't know.
[12:38.28]Alright, well I just like DDT'd that guy.
[12:40.78]Pause for the controls, okay.
[12:45.32]Roulette?
[12:45.84]Select roulette techniques, set up combo techniques.
[12:49.90]Left jab, straight, left hook, uppercut.
[12:53.78]Right roundhouse, guard breaker, charge punch, barrel roll kick.
[12:59.46]Pretty cool.
[13:01.60]Oh, Jesus.
[13:06.48]I'm assuming I unlock abilities.
[13:09.98]Yeah, okay.
[13:11.56]Let's just... Oh, fuck.
[13:12.90]What did I just do?
[13:16.00]Wait, why is circle select?
[13:17.54]No, I want to just... I fucked it all up.
[13:22.19]I'm trying to hit back.
[13:23.35]Circle is select?
[13:27.29]What the fuck?
[13:31.92]Uh, I got roulette techniques too.
[13:35.14]Divine smash, wild pitch.
[13:39.84]Alright, well, I haven't learned very much.
[13:45.86]Am I just dancing?
[13:46.46]Alright.
[13:48.32]Let's get out of here.
[13:50.64]I know how to move the camera.
[13:52.74]My phone, right here, right here.
[13:54.62]Divine smash, okay.
[13:56.44]God Hand roulette wheel.
[13:57.78]Press R1 to open the wheel, press R1 to cycle choices.
[14:02.46]Okay.
[14:02.68]What the hell is that?
[14:09.12]I'm gonna keep punching this thing?
[14:14.92]That's what I'm gonna do, I guess.
[14:16.26]I think it's got like a new technique.
[14:18.64]Get a haircut?
[14:19.42]NEVER!
[14:19.76]I will never get a haircut!
[14:23.24]It's gonna grow down to here and look terrible.
[14:25.10]Alright, roulette wheel.
[14:34.12]Open up the wheel.
[14:34.70]Alright, Ball Buster.
[14:39.28]Was that just a laugh track?
[14:40.26]I think that was a laugh track.
[14:44.12]Yeah, we just got a laugh track in God Hand.
[14:49.87]Shit.
[14:52.01]Alright, one more, alright?
[14:56.35]Can I kill him?
[14:58.19]Uh, Divine Smash.
[14:59.07]This game's actually kind of fun.
[15:06.45]Ponytail?
[15:07.07]I'm not gonna have a ponytail.
[15:18.83]I wanna like shoot this guy into space like I did before.

[15:25.68]Guard break was what?
[15:26.54]This?
[15:27.28]No.
[15:28.00]This.
[15:30.16]Not that, but whatever.
[15:33.68]Inside the house, right?
[15:35.12]I guess?
[15:35.82]Can I pick up the chair?
[15:38.92]I don't think so.
[15:42.66]I really wanted to play that fucking Tony Hawk game.
[15:48.36]Why does it have to be from, like, fucking 2006?
[15:49.63]The hell is that?
[15:52.95]Uh-oh.
[16:06.75]I fucking hate Tony Hawk.
[16:09.81]Just in case you were wondering.
[16:10.65]Did I just lose?
[16:20.30]I actually think I just lost.
[16:22.20]I'm so frustrated by the fucking... I can't even have fun in a video game now.
[16:26.20]I want to mail that to Tony Hawk.
[16:29.49]I want to cover that in peanut butter and mail it to him.
[16:34.99]then just like he'll think it's like but it's just peanut butter not a big deal it's a hard game no oh well oh I gotta start from the beginning oh god damn it alright what was the what was the guard break again so I can just go through this quickly

[17:08.79]Alright, let's kill, let's kill this guy.
[17:10.43]Can't block that!
[17:20.79]At least I can string that together, that's good.
[17:26.99]I can get hit by the boards, that's interesting.
[17:31.90]Uh, yeah, I mean, this game was supposed to be pretty fun.
[17:34.72]Yeah, that's cool.
[17:43.06]Fucking building collapsed on me.
[17:46.83]My hair?
[17:47.25]Well, it's there, so the thing with my hair is I... I like just, I let it like kind of go this way.
[17:54.07]I can move it.
[17:54.65]Let's move it like back, like the way it normally would be.
[17:58.40]It would normally be like this, but remember the PSVR fucking night?
[18:01.97]PSVR night like ruined the front of my hair.
[18:05.27]I ripped out like 85 hairs in the front of my head.
[18:07.25]Come on, do it.
[18:10.80]Let's do La Bamba.
[18:16.76]I'm gonna give this game like an 8 out of 10.
[18:18.78]Like an 8.2 out of 10.
[18:24.77]Shave?
[18:25.01]Oh, I gotta shave too.
[18:25.77]I gotta shave before Twitch.
[18:26.59]Don't worry.
[18:28.05]Don't worry.
[18:28.71]This whole day's been a fucking mess.
[18:30.53]So don't worry.
[18:31.18]At least I'm gonna get through this first building.
[18:42.08]Coming out of my cage.
[18:46.50]Actually, I'm getting a haircut tomorrow.
[18:48.36]Now that you mention that.
[18:50.36]I don't want to lose to, like, the demon.
[18:53.19]You guys know what my hair usually does.
[18:54.43]It goes, like, back this way.
[18:56.77]But I just, like, I was too lazy.
[18:58.37]No, no, no, I wasn't too lazy.
[18:59.55]I was too busy trying to get a fucking ten-year-old shitty peripheral to work for three hours.
[19:05.83]That's just, that's the long and short of it.
[19:11.55]What's a block?
[19:12.83]Do I have a block?
[19:15.09]I'm gonna lose.
[19:22.35]I guess I have to play this like... No, no, no, camera.
[19:24.25]What the hell are you doing?
[19:26.57]Okay, dude, a big prompt just said counter, I guess.
[19:30.42]Hold on a bit.
[19:33.90]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:35.06]I'm gonna like... Unleash the Groundhog.
[19:38.70]Once your tension gauge, press R2.
[19:40.00]Alright, whatever.
[19:40.88]Apparently just did it.
[19:45.20]Do I have the God Hand now?
[19:47.16]Is this the title of the game?
[19:56.63]I'm gonna lose.
[20:01.57]What?
[20:02.19]What's going on?
[20:02.81]What's going on here?
[20:05.21]Turn around!
[20:05.95]What the fuck, camera?
[20:07.91]You have to hold left... No, this isn't a disk.
[20:20.28]Let's play a real goddamn game for once.
[20:44.63]Give me a second.
[20:45.21]My mic is still on.
[21:00.88]I'm just like filled with sadness every time I try to play these games.
[21:05.10]I sit here for hours trying to get some of these fucking things to work.
[21:12.92]And it's just like, they don't hold up well.
[21:18.71]Not anymore.
