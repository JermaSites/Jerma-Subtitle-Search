[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.67]I'm back.
[00:08.86]Sorry, I took a handful nuts.
[00:23.56]Okay.
[00:24.92]This game is called Bits and Bops.
[00:28.66]So I'm going to try it.
[00:29.36]It looked fun.
[00:29.85]I usually like rhythm games and it's a rhythm game.
[00:35.15]Seemed cute, seemed fun.
[00:39.60]So let's try it.
[00:41.87]It might be loud, just giving you a fair warning.
[00:45.71]I don't know how loud this game is going to be.
[00:48.93]So, lower your volume for a second.
[01:03.99]I'm so glad I told you to do that.
[01:13.88]I'm so glad.
[01:14.98]I was like, I've been in this game for a long time.
[01:18.62]I'm ready for anything at this point.
[01:24.81]You didn't give us enough time?
[01:26.52]That was like 10, 20, 30 seconds!
[01:29.65]That was a two- no it wasn't, that was like a 30 second warning!
[01:32.62]I had enough time to turn down the wrong volume thing.
[01:37.11]I was like, okay, I'm gonna turn my volume down.
[01:39.41]I'm turning it down.
[01:40.39]I turned down the wrong meter.
[01:49.60]Why is my shit so loud?
[01:56.55]Okay.
[02:08.30]Dude, all games need to come at 50% volume.
[02:19.08]Song is great.
[02:24.50]These settings are powerful.
[02:25.69]You can use them to fine-tune the game's performance, but not every setting will work on your computer.
[02:37.69]Uh, that's probably fine, right?
[02:43.60]They were nice enough to make it a 9.
[02:51.70]That's fine.
[02:56.26]I don't think I let me I can test the buffer, right?
[03:02.82]X to bind a different action.
[03:04.19]X is fine.
[03:05.59]I'm on PS... PS5 controller.
[03:16.17]Can I go to the...
[03:17.11]Okay.
[03:17.69]Language, engine, custom, one button, whatever.
[03:21.14]Screen flash.
[03:22.39]What is that?
[03:23.07]No.
[03:25.32]Off.
[03:44.15]V-sync off for Rhythm Games, you're a sociopath.
[03:48.37]We'll see.
[03:51.44]Hi there, welcome to the Bits and Bops safety video.
[03:54.93]Before we start, I need to know a little bit about you.
[03:58.09]Do you like to be shown the ropes or do you prefer to figure things out for yourself?
[04:02.35]Let me figure it out.
[04:05.19]Thought so.
[04:05.90]I know an independent go-getter when I see one.
[04:08.30]Anyway, now that we've gotten to know each other, let's move on with the video.
[04:11.83]This is no ordinary record store, so you'll need to learn a thing or two before you can browse.
[04:15.91]Those nuts are coming up.
[04:19.54]First things first, let's check your equipment.
[04:21.92]The nuts are coming up.
[04:24.29]Let me see.
[04:24.80]What have you got there?
[04:26.06]Looks like you're using a game controller.
[04:28.21]That's great.
[04:29.21]Most game controllers work well out of the box, so there's nothing to worry about.
[04:32.23]Now the games in Bits and Bops use up to two buttons.
[04:35.38]Looks like you have more than enough.
[04:38.99]I'm playing with an Atari controller?
[04:43.80]Can you handle two buttons?
[04:45.91]I can handle that.
[04:47.36]My, uh, it's three or four buttons for me.
[04:49.75]I'm good.
[04:52.81]If you change your mind, come back here.
[04:53.84]Okay, anyways, that's it for the input.
[04:54.92]Okay, now let's move on to audio.
[04:56.07]Give me a second to start the metronome.
[05:00.52]Hmm.
[05:01.76]Tap X in time with the metronome.
[05:05.15]Okay.
[05:08.54]When do I start?
[05:09.88]I need a cue.
[05:21.15]Looks like your total delay is about nine milliseconds.
[05:23.50]That's incredible.
[05:25.57]Alright, let's go.
[05:31.81]Everything happens in time with the music.
[05:33.96]Let's try something simple.
[05:34.76]The target appears on one, moves on two, and you hit it on three.
[05:40.57]Okay.
[05:42.41]one two three one two three one two three
[05:52.89]Excuse me.
[05:57.04]Excuse me?
[05:58.83]Three.
[06:00.01]One, two, three.
[06:02.12]One, two, three.
[06:03.76]What the fuck?
[06:05.61]You got it.
[06:06.15]We're almost done here.
[06:06.90]There's just one more thing.
[06:08.43]Since everything happens in time with the music, the most important thing is to listen.
[06:11.59]If in doubt, trust your ears over your eyes.
[06:14.30]Let's try the same test again but with more personality.
[06:31.90]Got it.
[06:34.35]This concludes the Bits and Bops safety video.
[06:35.92]Thank you for your attention.
[06:38.23]You're now welcome to browse the store.
[06:39.39]Remember to listen to the music and above all, have fun.
[06:42.62]Yeah.
[06:45.90]Oh, hi.
[06:46.22]Welcome to Pitching Pops.
[06:47.57]I'm Bob, and this is my show.
[06:49.40]You'll be watching a safety video.
[06:51.58]Great.
[06:52.82]Minigames are on your right and the lounge is on your left.
[06:55.23]We've only just opened, so the selection is limited.
[06:57.56]Please bear with us.
[06:59.11]If you ever need anything, just ring the bell, okay?
[07:04.13]Looks like you don't have any mail right now.
[07:08.29]What can I help you with?
[07:08.89]I just wanted to ring the bell.
[07:12.00]Okay.
[07:15.76]What was this one?
[07:18.75]Flipper Snapper.
[07:26.49]Can we get a mouth cam?
[07:28.72]No, bro.
[07:30.35]Ah, the open ocean.
[07:31.75]The seal loves to bop the beach ball.
[07:34.16]Snap a photo.
[07:45.17]Nice.
[07:46.56]Sometimes he likes to juggle the ball.
[07:48.12]What a show off.
[07:50.05]When you hear the bell, get ready to snap three photos in a row.
[07:54.86]Okay.
[08:01.47]Oh, I thought it was inter- I thought it was fast!
[08:14.64]Great, now get out there and snap some photos.
[08:17.83]Oh, that was the tutorial.
[08:28.48]You think you're going to catch me with that?
[08:31.04]Oops.
[08:56.77]If you're good at rhythm games, you're good at Dark Souls games too.
[09:05.28]I will defend forever that all the FromSoftware games are just rhythm games in disguise.
[09:25.31]Did I get it?
[09:56.23]Wait!
[10:00.64]I was just jamming!
[10:05.64]Am I saying you're bad at rhythm games?
[10:07.83]No.
[10:08.13]I'm saying I'm good at rhythm games.
[10:12.13]I can see all the photos.
[10:14.50]You captured memories that will last a lifetime.
[10:17.52]Amazing.
[10:20.01]I didn't get the kiss?
[10:20.87]Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[10:28.73]Okay, eat the cake.
[10:30.88]You played your first mini game, great work.
[10:32.79]By the way, a package just arrived, it's for you.
[10:34.64]Head over to the counter to collect it.
[10:36.40]Okay.
[10:38.86]Check your mail every now and then.
[10:40.35]I'll do this one first.
[10:49.03]Sweet tooth.
[10:56.41]It's feeding time.
[10:59.51]Okay, snap up the cake.
[11:05.52]It's called improvising.
[11:16.43]Good job, now for the Cupcakes Tap X.
[11:18.86]Watch out there quick.
[11:25.56]Yeah.
[11:33.22]Excellent.
[11:33.59]Now get ready for the main course.
[11:54.99]That could have been better.
[12:20.68]I'm pretty fucking good.
[12:22.37]That's distracting me though.
[12:25.44]It's on purpose.
[13:00.65]What's wrong with the duck?
[13:11.11]I haven't missed a single fucking one this whole time.
[13:22.25]that's called a perfect score that was perfect
[13:34.00]I'll take a perfect.
[13:36.73]Let's freaking go.
[13:37.79]The crocodile is dead after all those sweets.
[13:45.62]Well, you don't know.
[13:46.21]That could have been alligator food made to look like cakes.
[13:54.28]Rock, paper, showdown.
[14:04.10]Do I have to press a different button?
[14:12.84]Wait.
[14:14.27]One, two.
[14:16.12]The age-old question.
[14:17.60]One, two, three, shoot.
[14:19.29]That's how I do it.
[14:22.51]I do one, two, three, shoot.
[14:24.52]One, twice, three, shoot.
[14:28.51]Listen for the cue to slow down.
[14:42.07]Okay.
[14:43.98]See if I can get this.
[14:45.65]This top row seems pretty simple.
[14:49.10]I shouldn't miss any of these.
[14:53.85]God damn it.
[14:59.88]I'll do it again.
[15:39.83]I thought we were looking at a cutscene!
[16:09.47]I could do this one better.
[16:10.23]Oh, I failed the last one.
[16:32.13]I like this game.
[16:32.69]It's cute.
[16:33.39]It's fun.
[16:38.89]Alright, we'll do the ant one and then we'll look at the male.
[16:53.41]Listen up troops, it's time to gather supplies.
[16:55.60]Simple, we form a line and march in time.
[16:58.17]Press X to step.
[17:04.39]Hey!
[17:09.34]Move.
[17:10.10]I don't like, I'm claustrophobic.
[17:11.16]I don't want to fucking be in here.
[17:19.53]When you hear the cue, get ready to take three quick steps in a row.
[17:39.60]I don't get it.
[17:40.33]Wait.
[17:41.01]Two.
[17:42.41]Three.
[17:52.62]I got it.
[17:56.50]You washed up?
[17:57.54]That was the training mission.
[19:14.74]Where's me?
[19:25.44]That was really cute.
[19:28.99]I like that one.
[19:35.04]I mean, I messed up a lot, but whatever.
[19:41.74]Is there a rating below out below amazing?
[19:53.70]It's cool.
[19:54.69]I think this might be a remix, yeah.
[19:58.75]Mixtapes are special.
[19:59.45]They combine everything you learned in a previous minigame.
[20:02.56]Okay, let's try it.
[20:07.56]Jungle Mixtape.
[20:13.55]I'm gonna get- I'm gonna do so bad on this.
[20:21.85]I thought we were gonna get a, hold on, restart it.
[20:24.17]I thought it was gonna say, hey, welcome to the mixtape.
[20:51.97]Alright.
[21:14.84]I was about to say I forget the buttons.
[22:45.54]Wow.
[22:53.67]I just nailed it.
[23:02.94]your friend of the forest.
[23:17.97]A game corner to your right offers a bit of a change of pace.
[23:20.47]Why don't you head over and check it out?
[23:21.86]There's more?
[23:24.76]Okay, welcome to the game corner.
[23:26.27]I should mention the games here work a bit differently.
[23:31.15]You can play these by yourself or with up to four players.
[23:33.43]So it is co-op.
[23:34.56]Oh, Ster is going to be pissed.
[23:41.13]Pause menu, minigame.
[23:42.43]Ah, it's alright.
[23:42.87]It's alright.
[23:43.34]It's alright.
[23:48.36]Well, let me see what it is.
[23:52.62]Press X to take the stage.
[23:55.15]Once everyone has joined.
[24:02.51]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[24:09.26]you
[24:23.85]Ha ha ha ha!
[24:30.03]Thank you.
[24:49.44]Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[24:57.79]Thank you.
[25:10.02]Ha ha ha ha!
[25:21.06]Oh, no, there's more.
[25:30.32]Is that it?
[25:35.17]There's more?
[25:35.83]I thought that was the end of the song.
[25:40.60]That's the end of the song.
[25:54.81]This- Heeey!
[26:06.72]Oh, I totally forgot to tell you about the metronome.
[26:08.86]Silly me.
[26:09.60]Press... Press...
[26:12.28]Okay.
[26:30.62]Thank you.
[26:47.46]The bassoons are a little quiet, dude.
[26:49.24]I'll tell them to turn it up.
[26:54.09]No, I can't do it, man.
[26:55.45]To me, this song goes fucking wild right now, like...
[27:05.03]And this guy was a mad scientist with fucking big white hair with goggles on, like fucking cackling.
[27:16.00]Thank you.
[27:33.44]Thank you.
[27:45.24]Thank you.
[28:05.32]so
[28:13.76]Thank you.
[28:38.41]I'm not ignoring the metronome, I'm on time!
[28:40.90]Look!
[28:41.73]Look at my hands!
[28:43.80]What are you on about?
[28:53.92]Okay, how do I get out of here?
[28:59.62]The new minigames have arrived.
[29:00.79]Head back to the shelves.
[29:01.97]Okay.
[29:04.15]Didn't I get mail?
[29:06.15]That's a lot of mail.
[29:06.96]I got a souvenir.
[29:10.37]Oh.
[29:11.71]Cool.
[29:13.74]A record.
[29:14.14]Video.
[29:27.62]I think it's all the songs.
[29:40.48]Come back and check your mail anytime.
[29:41.78]What was this again?
[29:45.42]Oh, you can play all the records.
[29:49.29]Cool.
[29:53.24]You can make it faster.
[29:57.44]That I'm talking about.
[30:03.02]Oh, wait, I can't turn it.
[30:03.87]How do I...
[30:18.55]Do I want to turn the firewall?
[30:20.75]Wait, did I not do that?
[30:22.03]That doesn't do it to my computer, right?
[30:29.59]There is steaming.
[30:32.54]Oh shit, I don't know what to do.
[30:45.85]Holy shit!
[30:57.75]That was wild.
[31:00.77]Listen up, crew.
[31:01.33]We've got moves to learn.
[31:03.49]When we clap three times, tap X four times to dance with us.
[31:20.23]Got it.
[31:30.44]Now for an advanced move, press and hold circle to spin and release to freeze.
[31:36.12]Listen for the 1-2 record scratch, then show us your moves.
[31:44.80]Alright.
[31:57.61]Cool.
[32:09.42]I'll pump up the jam, pump up the jam indeed.
[32:40.89]I like to chat.
[32:43.35]I was looking at chat.
[32:45.08]Somebody said I'm 40 and it pissed me off for a second.
[32:49.82]Let me restart this.
[32:50.50]That person just annoyed me.
[33:42.20]Perfect.
[34:08.20]That was weird.
[34:25.65]I was just feeling the beat, man.
[34:30.57]I wanted to keep going with the moves.
[34:59.89]Blow worms.
[35:13.49]What a perfect day to dance.
[35:14.75]Get ready.
[35:15.37]Up top.
[35:15.78]Press X to bop.
[35:36.09]You've got it.
[35:37.44]Okay, sometimes life comes at you faster if you're already prepared.
[35:39.56]Get ready.
[35:51.56]Okay?
[35:52.57]Relax and take your time.
[35:53.90]Don't sweat it.
[35:54.46]This will be a breeze.
[36:06.60]Right, that was easy.
[36:27.10]Oops.
[37:26.31]I missed it?
[37:38.06]Fuck you!
[37:38.89]No, they're cute.
[37:40.08]I mean, in general.
[37:54.75]Oh, why did I do that?
[37:58.88]They're too funny to look at.
[38:17.34]Hey, Jeremy, do you have tattoos?
[38:18.55]I don't have any tattoos.
[38:20.76]Except for the gigantic Nightwing symbol.
[38:25.43]That takes up the entirety of my whole chest and some of my stomach.
[38:32.56]I actually got it on my back too, just so people could see it from behind too.
[38:36.60]Like if I'm at the beach or something, I take off my shirt.
[38:39.01]I'm just like, yo, I'm just guessing an old Nightwing.
[39:10.06]I got it.
[39:18.77]Conversation is best when allowed to flow naturally.
[39:21.25]Try the same question without the bouncing ball.
[39:34.61]This is way, we will rock you with a bird.
[39:47.84]Okay, dun dun dun dun dun.
[40:06.32]Okay.
[40:30.91]Oh, he's pissed at me.
[40:46.87]No!
[40:51.97]Your bird is... No, I'm fine.
[40:55.56]He's not saying anything bad.
[40:58.42]Oh, fuck.
[40:59.68]I'm gonna get in trouble now.
[41:15.56]Wait, does that count?
[41:43.83]I thought it was three times!
[41:58.00]I'm the third time.
[41:58.91]Alright, I got it this time.
[41:59.97]No going back.
[42:55.61]I can't see the fun comic book I'm too...
[43:15.73]I like that one too.
[43:33.38]That remix is gonna kick the shit out of me though.
[43:46.42]Okay, there's an ice skating one?
[43:50.05]I'm so glad you've come skating with me.
[43:52.06]Let's start simple.
[43:52.83]All you have to do is wait a beat then skate a beat.
[43:56.35]Okay.
[44:01.98]He's dead.
[44:13.32]Okay.
[44:24.56]I've already scared somebody's cat.
[44:34.36]That's it.
[44:34.73]I knew you'd be good at this art.
[44:36.03]Something more advanced.
[44:36.88]When you hear the bells, get ready to take two quick steps.
[44:54.06]I get it.
[45:03.22]Okay.
[45:04.39]One more thing.
[45:04.89]We're going to change it up like before, but this time it's two offbeat steps.
[45:28.75]That's everything.
[45:30.01]Okay, let's do it.
[45:40.87]So super cute.
[45:45.35]I'm going home.
[45:47.86]The date is ruined.
[45:49.97]And I'm not even sure.
[45:52.63]I might not get called back.
[46:24.10]Perfect incoming.
[46:56.71]Almost got me.
[46:58.13]I'm good.
[47:47.21]Dude, I almost was offbeat at the end there.
[47:48.78]Something got me.
[47:50.16]But that was perfect, I think, right?
[47:59.90]Hey, good.
[48:12.81]Okay.
[48:13.79]Remix.
[48:30.72]Are we starting already?
[48:31.67]Okay, we're starting.
[48:52.82]The nuts came up.
[49:43.24]Yes!
[50:01.77]Shut up.
[50:02.63]I know people are making fun of me.
[50:11.85]I looked over and saw OMEGALUL with like three OMEGALULS next to it.
[50:16.27]I was just like, God damn it, that guy's...
[50:25.87]Omeglella has such a strong laugh too.
[50:28.14]That's like... That's not just chuckling, that is you're laughing so hard at what's going on.
[51:39.51]Hey, that was a good one.
[51:45.62]Oh, mega lull.
[51:55.36]Do I get another weird mini game now?
[52:00.83]You cleared another mixtape.
[52:02.86]We're waiting for the new minigames to arrive again.
[52:04.96]Why don't you head over to the game corner?
[52:08.72]Oh shit, too much mail.
[52:12.01]Oh my god, I have so much mail.
[52:14.25]I got a pin.
[52:34.10]Oh, I like that one.
[52:40.36]I want to watch the videos, but my computer has a virus on it, so I can't even open it.
[52:44.84]It literally is burning down.
[52:56.50]Look, see?
[52:58.19]Who are these people?
[52:59.73]Whoa, look at the computer!
[53:00.62]Hey, it wasn't me this time, I swear.
[53:03.48]Oh no, where are all these pop-ups coming from?
[53:05.35]Looks like someone has disabled the firewall.
[53:07.56]What an inconsiderate thing to do to the community computer.
[53:11.16]You wouldn't happen to know anything about this, would you?
[53:12.83]Oh, it looks like I'm working overtime again.
[53:15.10]I can't use the computer ever again.
[53:17.28]I locked myself permanently.
[53:41.17]Alright, new mini game.
[53:46.68]You downloaded Bonzi Buddy on the community computer?
[53:49.11]I know, dude.
[53:49.91]I just wanted him to sing the song.
[53:53.83]Okay, join the race.
[53:59.53]Okay, let me just... Now, the wall has to be a little higher.
[54:06.08]Yeah, that's fine.
[54:07.41]I think it needs to be two or three more blocks up.
[54:10.31]That's good.
[54:10.98]Take one block away.
[54:11.97]Yeah, that looks better.
[54:18.46]Press again if you want me to join you.
[54:21.29]What?
[54:22.33]Who the fuck is this?
[54:29.95]We did it!
[54:43.45]It's Bert and Ernie?
[54:46.83]Thank you for watching.
[54:56.82]Thanks for watching!
[55:01.03]dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[55:17.89]Oh, I can do better than that.
[55:19.92]I can do a hundred steps.
[55:26.82]I got to do two hands, two index fingers.
[55:32.60]Try it again.
[55:37.00]Bye-bye.
[55:46.39]Why is he going faster?
[55:47.35]Slow down!
[55:54.71]He decided to go faster for some reason.
[55:56.55]Am I playing with another person?
[56:02.09]Bye bye.
[56:14.71]Okay, it's gotten faster since we crossed the finish line.
[56:22.96]Ha ha ha!
[56:33.14]Hold on, I'll do it again.
[56:36.00]I'm obsessed with this one.
[56:39.20]Bye bye.
[56:49.19]Bye.
[56:57.54]Thank you.
[57:07.51]Thank you.
[57:18.58]What happened?
[57:19.79]Why did it go so wrong?
[57:21.14]Why did it go so wrong?
[57:27.71]I'm so, how did it go so wrong?
[57:30.09]I gotta get to 100 steps or I'm not ending the stream.
[57:35.98]Bye-bye.
[57:44.54]Thank you.
[57:53.83]Thank you.
[58:03.98]Bye.
[58:11.72]Thank you.
[58:22.00]Fuck, same exact pla- This fucking spit all over me.
[58:26.52]God damn it.
[58:29.23]How did I get to the exact same pla-
[58:39.65]Bye bye.
[58:49.39]Thank you.
[58:52.07]Thanks for watching!
[59:02.03]Bye.
[59:22.48]Thank you.
[59:36.76]I'm freaking out!
[59:52.48]I'm freaking out!
[60:41.67]Shit.
[60:43.36]340 steps.
[60:44.76]I'm not doing better than that.
[60:45.85]I was in a total complete state.
[60:47.98]I was in an absolute fucking locked in state.
[60:51.61]They made me laugh and I lost.
[60:57.96]I'm never going to get there ever again.
[60:59.45]Ever.
[61:00.22]You can do 500?
[61:00.74]No way, dude.
[61:02.48]Not a chance in hell.
[61:06.40].
[61:10.17].
[61:14.98].
[61:16.93]I gotta get rid of them.
[61:18.51]Let me try it one more time.
[61:27.37]We're gonna be quiet.
[61:35.18]Thanks for watching!
[61:44.99]Oh my god, dude, it's too hard.
[61:47.26]How the fuck did I do 340?
[61:54.73]I don't know how I did that.
[61:55.94]It's impossible to me at this point.
[62:11.45]You can go so fast if you get the whole thing right.
[62:21.76]It's good.
[62:32.58]Okay, this game's driving me crazy.
[62:35.01]Hold on.
[62:36.27]This is like, this is awesome.
[62:38.59]This is like the best version of this that I've ever played.
[62:41.42]I love this game just because of this part.
[62:46.43]Last time.
[62:51.25]Watch this shit.
[62:52.00]Ready?
[62:56.91]Oh, come on dude.
[63:16.25]I'm done.
[63:21.37]I'm done.
[63:22.08]I'm done.
[63:22.66]I'm done.
[63:22.92]I'm done.
[63:23.22]I'm done.
[63:30.31]Thank you.
[63:37.65]Okay, final one for real.
[63:39.74]If this is not the last one, I'm going to delete my Twitch account tomorrow.
[63:47.62]Bye.
[64:00.22]Bye.
[64:53.75]I'm going to take a break and come back.
[65:46.32]Oh, no!
[65:48.31]I was on the fucking roll, man.
[65:50.74]I thought it was...
[66:01.37]Thank you.
[66:10.80]I'm gonna freak out.
[66:12.15]No, I have to delete my chat.
[66:15.77]No, I don't.
[66:16.25]No, I don't.
[66:16.67]No, I don't.
[66:17.07]You see, there's a fucking fire in front of the monitor.
[66:23.86]You didn't read the vibe, Brent.
[66:30.99]The fine print said, if I made it over 300 steps, then you get one free bonus attempt.
[66:39.95]You just didn't see the fine print.
[66:47.51]I can't believe I could have had it right there too.
[66:50.37]What was it?
[66:50.69]350?
[66:50.93]380?
[66:52.50]We needed a facecam for that.
[66:56.06]Actually, probably, yeah.
[66:58.15]I probably looked so fucking weird.
[67:04.97]349.
[67:05.25]Not 350.
[67:07.18]That's so painful.
[67:11.90]Okay, we have the skewers to align.
[67:18.32]Oh I see.
[67:26.30]Why do I get a diaper ad every time I open this stream?
[67:28.49]That sounds like something going on with you.
[67:46.30]Okay.
[67:47.24]When the time is right, press and hold circle to unleash raw fury.
[67:55.78]Whoa.
[68:03.07]When do I do it?
[68:11.65]Oh fuck
[68:13.89]Oh, yeah, I'm getting Luigi'd here.
[68:22.47]Yeah, I'm getting Luigi'd.
[68:25.43]I've always pressed an X.
[68:39.76]You got to wait one second.
[68:49.77]Okay.
[68:53.79]Wait for a beat when they hang in the air.
[68:56.97]Oh, you have to let go.
[68:58.04]Right, right, right, right.
[68:59.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[69:01.32]You let go.
[69:01.82]You're like, I was holding it like an idiot.
[69:05.21]They just fucked my whole brain up.
[69:24.21]Dude, all I hear is...
[69:25.41]It's the only thing I hear.
[69:43.04]Oh my... You are never going to get past 340.
[69:49.03]Yes, I will.
[69:59.14]Oh fuck.
[70:16.27]I still hear tat tat tat tat tat tat.
[70:27.10]brain up for like the next two weeks do it again man
[70:35.56]I just see Bert and Ernie walking across the screen still.
[72:02.55]That song is like a comedy song.
[72:09.05]You could put that behind anything and it would make it funny.
[72:11.02]It doesn't matter what it is.
[72:34.76]Bye.
[72:35.73]Bye.
[72:41.71]Thanks for watching!
[73:11.36]Bye.
[73:37.28]This is the first time I've seen this kind of bird in a while.
[74:17.77]Oh, little astronaut, where are you hiding?
[74:46.15]Thanks for watching!
[74:54.33]do
[75:04.32]Thank you.
[75:10.69]Thank you.
[75:20.98]do
[75:30.53]Thank you.
[75:40.76]I'm gonna fucking scream!
[75:58.54]I'm gonna try as hard as I can this time.
[76:00.89]For real.
[76:01.48]My hands are so sweaty, I'm turning the controls sideways.
[76:53.98]Thank you.
[77:39.98]Thank you.
[78:08.85]What happened?
[78:11.18]I did it!
[78:11.58]I got 435!
[78:13.17]I did it.
[78:13.51]I didn't know where I was.
[78:14.43]I literally just looked down at the controller and didn't even think.
[78:20.28]435, that's gone.
[78:21.08]That's it.
[78:30.20]I can do 500?
[78:37.44]Okay, so yeah, here's how it works.
[78:45.07]That's why I got in that good state.
[78:47.48]When you put the foot down, you move the other guy.
[78:51.07]You know what I'm saying?
[78:53.39]So he starts to move.
[78:54.12]When you let go, he has to...
[78:55.94]If you go fast...
[78:57.27]He has to go fa- dude, it's- this is hard, but I love it.
[79:00.83]Last try.
[79:02.19]I'm gonna try to lock in.
[79:05.97]I'm done.
[79:07.48]My spit's... Did you hear the spit?
[79:11.60]I'll take 435.
[79:18.76]da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
[79:26.71]500 is too high for you.
[79:28.18]I know what you're doing and I know it's a good tactic, but it's not going to work right now.
[79:49.51]What a fun minigame, though.
[79:50.77]It's so fun.
[80:17.07]This is relaxing compared to what I just did.
[81:09.99]Did I get it wrong?
[81:19.18]da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
[81:28.58]Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo.
[81:30.28]I see that.
[81:30.90]I see you in chat.
[81:48.04]Do I get something for going past 300 steps?
[81:55.06]Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee.
[81:57.21]Grr sounds.
[81:58.29]Oh, God.
[82:01.40]Do you remember when I did grr one time and everybody freaked out?
[82:07.06]That was one of the most immediate stop doing that's I've ever had on this stream.
[82:13.51]I was like, I thought people were gonna think it was funny or something.
[82:16.12]No, shut up, dude.
[82:17.52]Stop.
[82:18.01]Shut up.
[82:24.78]It was during Elden Ring.
[82:41.15]Okay.
[82:43.18]Keep an ear for change in the rhythm.
[82:44.77]Let's build it.
[83:27.43]I just clicked over.
[84:12.37]Get out of here, cat!
[84:21.00]Cute.
[84:33.47]I could have got 100% on this one.
[84:39.86]Amazing.
[84:49.13]Alright, so now I got one more here.
[84:56.65]Very cool.
[85:13.75]Thank you.
[85:18.74]Thank you.
[85:23.75]Thank you.
[85:33.31]Holy shit, dude, that could have been crazy if I had locked it in.
[85:41.30]That's it.
[85:44.04]I'm back.
[85:44.59]I just want to do one attempt.
[85:52.21]The moles.
[85:53.55]Molcano.
[86:02.41]You have no strategy there?
[86:03.64]Hey, you're talking to somebody that got to 435.
[86:07.48]If you think there was no strategy of what I was just doing, you just don't know what I was doing.
[86:25.26]What do you want me to do?
[86:40.15]Listen for the whistle, then tap circle to slam the brakes.
[86:44.01]Brake at the same time or you'll lose your balance.
[87:02.08]I- I don't- I'm not arsenic, is it?
[87:08.21]Okay.
[87:15.06]Double time, listen carefully to the count in.
[87:20.60]One, two, three, four.
[87:23.43]How many times do I do it?
[87:35.43]This one's going to be hard.
[87:54.80]What's wrong with him?
[87:56.87]What is wrong with him?
[88:01.45]I don't understand what's going on
[88:40.60]Why does he keep fucking up?
[88:46.13]What's going on with him?
[88:50.32]What is going on with him guys?
[89:00.48]He's you.
[89:01.00]I know he's me, but like, what am I doing wrong?
[89:05.15]because it's just 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, what's going on here?
[89:19.73]1, 2, 3, 4.
[89:20.38]1, 2, 3, 4.
[89:21.18]1, 2, 3, 4.
[89:22.07]1, 2, 3, 4.
[89:22.89]1, 2, 3, 4.
[89:24.48]1, 2, 3, 4.
[89:25.64]That's what I'm doing.
[89:35.23]Did I miss something in the tutorial here?
[89:46.87]Yes, you do.
[89:55.11]You only have a two and four.
[89:57.94]I was hitting every single time they would touch it.
[90:00.99]I was going on every beat.
[90:03.91]That's a cool, and it's the only time I've ever had it in the whole game.
[90:11.93]I just didn't understand.
[90:18.53]Okay.
[90:23.13]Let me do that one again.
[90:36.72]Okay, yeah, yeah, we're learning how to...
[90:38.65]Follow my lead and tap X to push the handle.
[90:42.05]Okay.
[90:50.39]I don't understand.
[90:51.87]Press X to push the handle.
[90:54.06]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[90:57.01]Why is it not doing it sometimes?
[91:00.93]You're the one on the right.
[91:08.78]Only on your- I'm the one on the right?
[91:11.51]Right on- when- when- player 1 is always on the left.
[91:15.49]When is player 1 on the right?
[91:30.89]Player one, first player is always on the left.
[91:34.64]That's a player two swap scenario.
[91:36.33]I should be on the left.
[91:44.02]The bird was on the right.
[91:46.59]Yeah, but this is clearly player one and player two.
[91:49.46]That was clearly marked.
[91:50.88]I knew I was the yellow bird.
[91:52.25]There's two of the same mole here.
[91:54.80]that one of the moles doesn't have like a green hat on.
[92:12.26]You got your controller plugged into the wrong port.
[92:27.10]The mole that's constantly fucking up was you.
[92:29.41]I thought he was fucking up because I was pressing it at the wrong time.
[92:58.16]I tripped.
[93:15.71]One, two.
[93:18.26]I like to chat.
[94:18.69]No!
[94:27.28]I'm good at any game that has three buttons with an OMEGALUL.
[94:30.76]Do you see how many da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dans I did?
[94:36.07]I've got a little bit of finger fatigue.
[94:38.90]That's all it is.
[94:47.23]Okay, I gotta be ready for this.
[94:55.87]What was the first game here?
[94:56.92]No, ice skating was up the last one.
[95:21.80]I forgot this one.
[95:48.96]That was weird.
[96:25.51]Alright.
[96:26.85]Okay.
[96:34.96]Hehehehe!
[97:19.05]I nailed it.
[97:21.77]Nailed it.
[97:33.33]six mistakes isn't nailing it out of 500 notes that is a
[97:39.17]That is like a 1% failure rate.
[97:42.01]That's a 99% success rate.
[97:49.60]What else could this be?
[97:50.95]There's another one of these.
[97:56.36]Well, why don't I...
[98:06.72]What?
[98:17.34]den den den den den den den den den den den den den den

[103:17.16]Oh my god, why did I stop doing it?
[103:19.41]I stopped and looked at chat and somebody did a fucking face!
[103:24.11]I'm gone.
[103:24.79]That's too much to have to... No, I'm done.
[103:26.82]By the way... Oh, we can change the starting speed.
[103:31.51]No, goodbye.
[103:32.91]I'm out.
[103:33.21]I'm out.
[103:33.39]I'm out.
[103:33.57]I'm out.
[103:33.76]I'm out.
[103:43.19]Bye.
[104:02.03]I'm fine.
[104:06.66]Ooh, a cat.
[104:10.80]Let me check the computer again.
[104:11.80]Did they fix it yet?
[104:25.89]Complete the powerful ocean mixtape and forge every available item.
[104:34.87]Alright, the computer's back.
[104:36.83]Hey, I'm Disco.
[104:37.74]You might not believe it, but I'm a pirate.
[104:40.21]Right now I'm searching for treasure.
[104:41.49]I haven't found any loot here.
[104:42.51]This shop is a little empty.
[104:46.10]Oh, cute.
[104:57.53]Are there little cartoons?
[105:02.88]Oh, it's just like a perfect.
[105:10.00]Editor?
[105:10.46]Join the Discord.
[105:13.18]Oh, you can join their Discord.
[105:14.33]That's cool.
[105:19.63]I feel like that's gonna erase all my progress.
[105:21.23]I'm not doing that.
[105:36.36]President Byrd.
[105:47.66]Mr. President, I have terrible news.
[105:48.85]A nebulous disaster is occurring.

[109:06.42]Tap X to knock the coin into the box for safekeeping.
[109:10.38]Okay, if you miss any, you'll be picking them up.
[109:20.63]That's far too slow, we'll be doing it at this rate.
[109:23.21]Can you handle three at a time?
[109:29.23]Whoa.
[109:33.39]I get it.
[109:35.43]Jams are the most precious.

[111:43.37]Fuck, this one's hard.
[112:11.15]Yeah, don't use the visual cues.
[112:14.42]I'm trying to just use the beat, but sometimes you just see the coin flying.
[112:18.56]You're like, I need to get that.
[112:20.15]Is that a cool...
[112:23.79]No.

[114:42.16]My God.
[114:48.49]Bro, stop.
[115:09.38]Typical Dunkin' Donuts order from some fucking idiot.
[115:13.19]Hold on, what am I doing?
[115:27.51]That was really fun.
[115:39.49]Amazing.
[115:42.57]Oh, majestic.
[115:45.87]A hunter is a hunter in a train.
[115:54.94]Auuuuhhh!
[116:11.87]Time for an interplanetary adventure.
[116:16.71]We always march in step.
[116:18.79]We march with X.
[116:20.00]Don't screw it up.
[116:21.30]We gotta conquer Earth and kill everybody.
[116:33.20]Planet Hop.
[116:37.62]Step on the offbeats.
[116:40.03]Can you hear the low notes?
[116:40.87]That's your cue to planet hop back down again.
[116:43.57]Let me tell, hold on.
[117:11.24]That was weird, but I think I got it.
[117:21.78]Carson, or some say Carson.
[117:50.98]grant us eyes.
[119:21.83]The game crashed.
[119:31.10]oh that one is that was hard there's a lot of half step off steps
[119:43.13]Well, there's another mixtape.
[119:44.42]I'm a little worried about this one.
[119:45.53]It looks dangerous.
[119:51.84]Let's just cool down with a little bit of...
[120:02.03]Bye.
[120:17.64]Oh my god
[120:34.29]Thank you.
[120:48.50]you
[120:58.41]Thank you.
[121:12.25]This is the first time I've seen a Japanese tit.
[122:42.91]What's going on?
[122:52.03]Thank you.
[122:57.02]Thank you.
[123:07.01]What did I get to?
[123:14.17]661.
[123:15.89]Let's go.
[123:17.00]Alright, that's over 500.
[123:18.60]Somebody said they only have my respect if I get over 500.
[123:22.52]That person...
[123:23.86]I did it.
[123:27.62]Oh, you bet on it.
[123:29.04]What did you bet on?
[123:29.55]$500?
[123:30.01]Is that what the bet was?
[123:33.39]$400.
[123:34.21]Oh, man.
[123:35.27]$400.
[123:38.47]Wow.
[123:41.46]Okay, well...
[123:47.28]I never doubted.
[123:48.54]Oh, so you lap.
[123:54.27]Okay.
[123:54.55]Because I was wondering, I was like, why am I here?
[123:56.52]I looked up like four or five times and I'm like, why am I in a, I already saw this.
[124:02.92]Alright, I win.
[124:05.13]500 is the actual goal.
[124:15.12]Looked up?
[124:15.73]Yeah, I was doing it to the beat.
[124:21.38]You can't just do it to the beat though, you have to actually make sure you're still stepping in the right place.
[124:26.57]You can do it to the beat,
[124:28.37]But you need to every so often look up to make sure you're not...
[124:31.74]Hold on.
[124:33.28]You need to make sure you're not getting too far ahead of the other guy.
[124:37.16]So every like five, 10, 15 seconds, I would kind of like look up and be like, hey, one, two, one, two, one, two, three.
[124:44.23]And then one, two, one, two, one.
[124:45.73]Make sure we're still in step.
[124:53.14]Because you can actually go faster.
[124:54.33]I didn't see Mount Rushmore.
[124:57.22]No, I didn't.
[124:58.07]That was one of the five seconds I was looking down.
[125:26.57]This one's fucked.
[125:53.20]Oh, sorry.
[125:56.04]The alien one, I don't have down.
[128:17.04]Holy shit, that one's hard to do.
[128:30.96]That's yeah, I don't know about that one.
[128:35.60]That's fun though.
[128:37.87]OK, so I did I did them all.
[128:43.06]You cleared the last mixtape.
[128:44.23]That's amazing.
[128:45.15]I just knew you'd be able to handle it.
[128:46.80]Well, that's it.
[128:47.26]You've completed absolutely everything we have to offer.
[128:49.53]Unless I'm forgetting something.
[128:54.32]Uh oh.
[128:57.35]What's this one?
[129:01.74]Press X to clap.
[129:03.86]Clap at a slow consistent pace.
[129:17.62]Build speed to bring the audience with you?
[129:45.13]Oh, I fucked it up.
[129:54.04]Hold on, I can do that way better.
[130:35.79]Okay, I'm out of here.
[130:38.68]Great news, the new minigames have arrived.
[130:40.68]Wait a minute, we weren't expecting a delivery.
[130:45.02]Dude, did we just get a bonus one?
[130:49.53]It's not over.
[130:53.22]Oh, this is the Omega Hard mixtape.
[130:56.24]Probably combines everything.
[131:01.32]Oh dear.
[131:02.20]Final mixtape.
[131:04.17]I'm going to get destroyed on this one.
[131:38.29]Oops.
[132:46.87]I forget this one.
[132:59.44]Oh, mega wall.
[133:56.19]That's how I was weird.
[133:57.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[134:01.49]Scream in his face.
[134:09.95]What?
[134:43.39]Is there, is it?
[134:44.32]Okay.
[134:49.72]That was fun.
[134:53.01]You made it through the whole store.
[134:59.53]Oh my gosh, that was incredible.
[135:01.38]The style, the moves, the flair.
[135:02.91]You proved yourself in every single minigame.
[135:05.18]And just in time too, since we're about to close for the day.
[135:08.03]Thank you for visiting Bits and Bops.
[135:11.14]Hope we see you again soon.
[135:14.29]What about all my mail?
[135:26.91]Oh, we're closed.
[135:29.29]Is there a minigame credits?
[135:43.67]That was really nice.
[135:44.43]I liked it a lot.
[136:04.70]Are there more games like that?
[136:15.55]rhythm doctor because I played rhythm heaven before I don't think I don't think I ever did the wait this is Kickstarter game
[136:25.84]That's interesting.
[136:27.59]Cool.
[136:32.11]Rhythm Doctor is good.
[136:38.02]I loved it.
[136:39.08]I thought it was great.
[136:41.50]I thought it was exactly... Oh, wait, hold on.
[136:45.44]Oh, you must be the customer Bop told me about.
[136:47.32]Welcome back.
[136:48.40]Bob's away at the moment, so I'll be looking after the counter for a while.
[136:51.66]By the way, I'm Bit.
[136:53.08]I'm the one who keeps things running around here.
[136:55.69]Just so you know, it might be a while before we get any more minigames.
[136:59.01]Besides, we don't even have any more shelf space.
[137:01.80]I told Bop we didn't have room for that final mixtape, but he didn't listen.
[137:05.31]Anyway, if you're looking for advice on where to go from here just ask.
[137:10.02]Looking for the next big challenge, huh?
[137:11.44]I do have a challenge for you.
[137:12.61]Let's see.
[137:13.61]You've cleared every minigame.
[137:14.88]Nice.
[137:15.92]Well, now that you have the basics down, it's time to improve those scores.
[137:19.66]Getting a cool sticker is a great achievement, but amazing stickers are even better.
[137:23.68]I think you've got it in you.
[137:24.52]Go for an amazing sticker on every minigame.
[137:27.49]What about my mail?
[137:34.18]Maybe this DLC.
[137:38.04]Yeah, that was great.
[137:38.87]That was exactly the kind of game that those old rhythm games for the Wii and DS were like.
[137:50.79]Melatoninism.
[137:51.52]I played Melatonin.
[137:52.69]I played the demo a year or two ago.
[137:55.29]It was good.
[138:04.63]God, look at all this.
[138:05.63]I got all this stuff.
[138:07.54]Yeah, the Rhythm Heaven coming out next year, I'm actually excited for.
[138:14.97]Oh my god.
[138:21.89]Thanks for collecting your packages.
[138:23.08]We're running pretty short on space.
[138:25.90]Every slot has been filled.
[138:36.32]Oh, you go down.
[138:37.06]Cute.
[138:40.70]That was lovely.
[138:42.54]Who are you?
[138:43.71]Gee, this music is a little slow.
[138:50.17]And that's going to be the end of the stream.
[138:57.41]one more no dude I expelled all of my energy doing that last one to 600 661
[139:11.44]But yeah, that was a fun day.
[139:13.98]That was a good to see Ster.
[139:16.27]Good to hang out with Ster and do the couple of whip.
[139:18.76]I played three games today.
[139:23.20]Where Winds Meet actually seems pretty fun.
[139:29.54]It's been a while since I've, besides like Elden Ring, where I've just really wanted to just beat something.
[139:37.24]So I might actually play that off stream.
[139:39.83]Maybe I'll play it on stream.
[139:41.76]That might be an iPad game for me.
[139:43.25]Seem pretty fun.
[139:51.13]I'll look into Rhythm Doctor too.
[139:52.31]I'll see where I'll go get it maybe.
[139:53.95]Is it on Steam?
[139:54.95]Or is it on a different platform?
[140:05.54]It's on Steam.
[140:06.25]Okay.
[140:08.07]I'll check it out.
[140:14.02]Thanks for hanging out.
[140:14.69]Thanks for watching.
[140:15.53]Thanks for chilling out.
[140:17.28]I probably won't see you for at least a few days here.
[140:22.14]But when I am back, we will finish Withering Rooms and... we'll do something else.
[140:35.51]Let me look at the calendar.
[140:40.86]Um...
[140:46.64]I'll definitely be around this weekend.
[140:48.80]Look out for like a weekend.
[140:51.13]Maybe like a Friday-ish.
[140:53.12]Friday, Saturday, probably.
[140:55.71]or maybe a Thursday, but Friday for sure.
[141:02.68]Bro's got a calendar?
[141:03.60]Yeah, on my computer.
[141:04.42]I click the button down here where the time is and I see what day it is.
[141:11.00]Yeah, SEGA CD is gonna come back this weekend.
[141:14.12]I don't know if we'll do that on Friday, but maybe we will.
[141:17.25]Maybe I'll just do it.
[141:22.49]But yeah, take it easy.
[141:23.43]Thanks for hanging out.
[141:23.97]Thanks for watching.
[141:26.44]It was a fun day.
