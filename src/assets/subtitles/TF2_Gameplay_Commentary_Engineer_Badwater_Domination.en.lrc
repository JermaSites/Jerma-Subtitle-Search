[00:01.85]What's going on, guys?
[00:02.93]It is Jerma.
[00:04.23]I'm going to start this video out.
[00:05.35]This is a gameplay commentary on Badwater as an engineer, but before that, I want to give a quick update on the giveaway that I am currently doing on this channel.
[00:16.28]I want to thank everybody for subscribing, even if you just want the hat, even if your only intention is to get the hat.
[00:23.72]I don't care.
[00:24.56]I'm glad that you guys came to check the channel out, and I hope more of you come, and I hope you tell your friends and your family
[00:30.61]And your family's family about the channel.
[00:32.43]No, but thanks a lot, guys.
[00:35.83]The update that I want to give to this giveaway is a guy by the name of Smokin' Jojo Davis decided to give me a Plants vs. Zombies bucket head.
[00:51.36]And he wants me to give that away also with the Honcho's Headgear.
[00:54.98]So I'm going to be doing two giveaways on Saturday.
[00:57.76]One of them is going to be the Honcho's Headgear.
[00:59.54]And the other one is going to be the Plants vs. Zombies Bucket Helm, courtesy of Smokin' JoJo.
[01:05.04]So if you see him in-game, give him a thanks, give him a shout-out, because he's a cool guy.
[01:10.05]So keep subscribing if you haven't subscribed already, because there's going to be more giveaways.
[01:14.65]Like I said, I'm going to start giving away potentially even Steam games every month, so you want to stick around for that.
[01:22.34]So here is the gameplay commentary right now.
[01:27.85]Like I said, this is on Badwater.
[01:30.51]Defense on Badwater.
[01:32.17]Playing an engineer with the regular sentry gun, the JAG, and the Frontier Justice.
[01:39.42]I love the Frontier Justice.
[01:40.66]I don't think I'll ever go back to the regular shotgun, ever.
[01:44.19]But I'm a little late here.
[01:45.21]I started a little too late.
[01:46.41]30 seconds left.
[01:47.57]I lost about half the time.
[01:49.96]Just kind of with my thumb up my ass in there, setting up the recording.
[01:54.30]But I'm a little nervous right now.
[01:56.58]I think, you know, why am I even being an engineer?
[01:58.60]I should probably just switch classes.
[02:00.52]But I say, I'll put it over here on the left.
[02:02.15]It'll be okay.
[02:03.15]No, okay, there is an engineer's nest already built there.
[02:07.69]So I think I'll come up here into this little ledge up here on the left.
[02:11.91]No, there's a Mini-Sentry there.
[02:13.09]The round starts.
[02:14.62]So I just put it over here on this ledge.
[02:18.94]And I think I'm just going to switch classes after this anyways.
[02:22.08]A few people come out, it kills them.
[02:24.46]And you'll see what happens here.
[02:25.74]I get shot in the face.
[02:27.02]I go, time to switch classes.
[02:28.58]This is a bunch of bullshit.
[02:30.97]Whatever.
[02:31.49]I'm just going to go play like a heavy or something.
[02:33.83]But my sentry gets a few more kills and I look over and I say, hold on a second.
[02:38.19]The engineer that was there was repairing it and he upgraded it to level 2.
[02:42.33]So I say, I'll give it another shot.
[02:44.27]Why not?
[02:44.87]I'll just go back out here.
[02:46.43]Who knows what's going to happen.
[02:48.31]And
[02:49.45]I'm not going to be able to commentate on this next part, because the sentry kills way too many people for me to even tell you what's going on.
[02:59.18]So, I get it to level 3, and I don't have any metal left.
[03:04.17]I'm like, oh god, I gotta turn around and go get metal.
[03:08.45]So, it kills this heavy that comes out.
[03:10.57]I turn around to get some metal.
[03:12.33]Hopefully, I'm thinking, please, please, please, please, please, please, please do not get rid of this sentry gun.
[03:16.42]Don't kill it.
[03:17.71]More people come out and die, and like I said, I can't even commentate, this thing gets, I think, like about 15 kills and 9 assists or something like that.
[03:25.74]Something ridiculous.
[03:27.20]So, what turned out to be a very bad situation became a very good situation in a matter of seconds.
[03:36.80]Killing more people with this thing... See, I'm more concerned right now with my own life.
[03:41.41]I...
[03:42.35]I think that I'm in no man's land here.
[03:44.61]I'm really scared about spies because, you know, obviously I'm just facing one direction this entire time.
[03:49.39]That other sentry now has a wrangled sentry on the right, so they can't even get out of their spawn now.
[03:54.49]And this sentry gets a lot of kills.
[03:58.71]It's very, very, very, very dominating.
[04:02.42]And the server was a little laggy, but
[04:05.72]I figured I had to upload this anyways.
[04:07.46]A spy comes over, saps all my stuff.
[04:09.58]I go, no, it's going to be over.
[04:11.82]But that other engineer comes and saves the day with me again.
[04:15.66]So props to that guy because he's a team player.
[04:19.58]Upgrade the dispenser.
[04:21.75]And I'm still scared.
[04:23.09]I still think this is not going to work.
[04:25.15]But it's been working for a while.
[04:27.83]I get more kills.
[04:29.27]And like I told you, it's killing so many things right now that I can't even tell you what's going on.
[04:35.46]Like, who just died?
[04:37.18]Who was that?
[04:38.60]What was his name?
[04:39.64]Who was his family?
[04:40.53]But a soldier comes out, starts to take it out.
[04:44.25]It doesn't go down.
[04:45.23]It's still up.
[04:47.09]I go, oh, here comes the rockets here.
[04:49.37]At this point, I'm thinking they have to be talking to each other and making a strategy.
[04:53.05]This heavy is shooting it from a point where I cannot target him, or where the sentry cannot target him.
[04:58.24]So I decide I'm going to try a little scare tactics.
[05:00.48]I pull the wrangler out.
[05:02.15]and I aim in there and he just goes, and runs away, which is exactly what my plan was.
[05:07.89]So that worked out pretty well.
[05:09.51]I get backstabbed by a spy, and the party is over.
[05:16.00]But what was supposed to be a complete, like, just nothing, I don't care, I'm going to put this down, and I'll change to soldier or heavy next, you know, next life.
[05:27.09]It actually turned out to be quite a good gameplay, so...
[05:30.85]I'm very, very glad about that.
[05:32.09]And I probably should have switched to the Gunslinger at this point, because you'll see I kind of just drop level ones as if they are from the Gunslinger.
[05:39.98]So, see, oh, I'm going to drop this, get it to, like, level one.
[05:43.28]Oh, well, just do it again.
[05:44.38]You killed it.
[05:44.82]Who cares?
[05:46.32]At this point, there's only a minute left, and they haven't even gotten to halfway to the first point.
[05:51.76]So this is merely just for, you know, distraction so my teammates can, you know, give the final blow, so to speak.
[06:00.54]I sneak up behind these two.
[06:01.64]I let the spy, you know, I'm not going to blow his spot up.
[06:03.78]I kill the medic.
[06:04.88]He only had probably five health anyways, but I didn't want to blow that spy's spot up.
[06:09.99]Kill the scout with a couple of revenge crits.
[06:14.05]And this is over.
[06:15.79]It's pretty much the end here.
[06:17.11]I drop one sentry here just in case a spy comes back and doesn't realize what he's doing or a scout tries to run past the point or something.
[06:25.65]But with 10 seconds left, I'm pretty sure you guys know the outcome.
[06:29.07]I don't think I have to tell you what happens.
[06:30.93]Alright, I'll tell you what happens.
[06:32.53]They come back and they win.
[06:34.41]No, I'm just kidding.
[06:36.97]Thank you so much again, guys.
[06:38.65]You don't know what it means to have 95 or 100 of you subscribe to the channel.
[06:43.73]Even if you want the hat, like I said before, even if you just want the hat, thank you so much.
[06:47.63]I hope you guys look forward to more stuff as much as I look forward to you guys being around.
[06:51.95]Thank you so much, and I look forward to Saturday.
[06:54.79]Take care.
