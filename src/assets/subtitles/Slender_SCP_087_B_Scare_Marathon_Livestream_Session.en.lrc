[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.43]Open up, please.
[00:01.43]I'm gonna have to lower the volume on it, too, because it is pretty loud.
[00:04.65]Oh, Marty getting the chills.
[00:15.82]And abracadabra, can you see it?
[00:18.42]I hope so.
[00:24.15]I think you can.
[00:24.97]Oh, I gotta get the chat up here.
[00:27.96]I cannot hit escape, though.
[00:29.40]That's the one big thing.
[00:31.08]Cannot hit escape.
[00:34.38]Move this.
[00:36.96]So I can see what you guys are saying.
[00:43.17]There's that.
[00:49.19]Oh, no.
[00:49.47]The chat can't fit anywhere.
[00:51.81]Hold on.
[00:52.03]Can I move this?
[00:52.63]I can.
[00:53.34]Excellent.
[00:56.74]There we are.
[00:58.78]One more second, guys.
[01:03.22]Move this to here.
[01:09.42]Perfect.
[01:11.50]Perfect.
[01:14.13]Now I can see what everybody's saying.
[01:17.17]Time to play Slender.
[01:23.57]Oh boy, oh boy.
[01:26.40]So the goal here tonight, guys, is I'm going to try and get all the pages.
[01:32.83]I'm going to try and beat this game.
[01:34.29]I'm going to do it.
[01:41.42]Let's go!
[01:43.15]Gonna beat Slender, I'm gonna beat Slender.
[01:48.92]Definitely not gonna beat Slender, because it is like impossible to beat.
[01:54.37]Because once you get like seven pages, he just eats your soul.
[01:59.63]Alright, here comes page one, guys.
[02:01.61]Welcome to the scare stream.
[02:04.50]Happy preliminary Halloween.
[02:06.60]Let's do... Oh, wait.
[02:08.82]Hold on.
[02:09.68]Oh, that just ruined my whole entrance.
[02:11.64]I hit E, not click.
[02:14.50]Here we go.
[02:18.25]I only have the headphone in one ear, I know.
[02:19.85]You can call me whatever you want to call me.
[02:26.27]I thought I just saw him.
[02:28.03]I thought I just saw him.
[02:30.77]This, I'm going to try to upload this to YouTube.
[02:32.69]So if you are going to miss some of this, I'm going to try to get the whole thing up there.
[02:37.07]If you're watching this on YouTube, hey, what's up?
[02:38.66]How you doing?
[02:41.38]I just walk in like a circle.
[02:42.86]Alright, let's see.
[02:49.39]I'm not looking behind me.
[02:51.39]Everyone's like, oh, behind you, behind you.
[02:53.47]I ain't looking behind me.
[03:05.25]Whoa, I hear static.
[03:06.59]Where is he?
[03:07.27]I hear static right now.
[03:08.92]Where the hell is he?
[03:09.62]I hear static right now.
[03:10.56]Where is he?
[03:12.24]He's probably right there.
[03:17.76]What?
[03:18.20]What?
[03:18.54]Where is he?
[03:18.92]I don't even know where he is.
[03:19.66]I don't know where the hell he is.
[03:21.72]Where is he?
[03:23.95]Oh my god, where is he?
[03:27.89]He's probably like right... Ready?
[03:32.80]He's right there, he's right there, he's right there.
[03:34.62]Run to the tree, run to the tree, run to the tree, run to the tree.
[03:37.60]The tree of life.
[03:41.79]Don't look for him.
[03:43.11]That's the thing, you have to look for him.
[03:45.33]You have to turn and look.
[03:46.45]Hello, page two.
[03:48.59]As long as I know where he is, I'm going to be fine.
[03:52.77]He's right behind me.
[03:54.11]He's right up my ass.
[03:57.01]I'll tell you a thing or two, Slender Man.
[04:00.12]You want to mess with me?
[04:02.51]I'll give you the one, two... Why am I taking my hands off?
[04:05.73]I'm like... Oh, let me make a joke and die.
[04:09.33]That's a great idea, Jeremiah.
[04:16.15]Is there anything on here?
[04:18.63]Can I go in there and go to the bathroom?
[04:20.27]I thought he was right there.
[04:21.53]Come on, get three.
[04:22.39]Go!
[04:24.25]He's still behind me.
[04:24.93]I know exactly where he is.
[04:29.86]I wish I could run.
[04:33.68]Damn, I wish I could sprint.
[04:37.34]I can sprint now.
[04:40.28]I love reading the chat, it's so fun.
[04:48.15]I can't believe I said I was gonna beat this game.
[04:51.49]There's no way I'm gonna beat this game.
[04:52.93]Are you kidding me?
[04:57.18]Are you kidding me?
[05:04.56]Did I just walk in a giant circle?
[05:05.94]No, there's... I can't even see.
[05:08.70]Yep, that's the next point.
[05:09.74]I gotta go there.
[05:13.38]You needed something to fall asleep to.
[05:15.34]Larry, I'm sorry.
[05:16.58]This is what you have to fall asleep to.
[05:17.92]It would be tough if I was you.
[05:21.51]Slender and SCP containment breach.
[05:31.23]See, it's good having you guys here in the chat, because when I play this game alone, whenever I play, like, scary games alone, there's not a whole lot, it's so terrifying, I can't, I'm much better, like, looking over and seeing all you guys in the chat.
[05:45.66]Makes it so much better.
[05:46.78]Because now, I won't, like, crap my pants, except I already did, like, in the first 30 seconds of this game starting.
[05:56.35]I'm scared right now!
[05:58.17]My teeth are chattering.
[06:13.12]There was no indication that that was going to happen.
[06:24.74]One down.
[06:25.28]It's like only three more games to play.
[06:29.75]Oh man, that hurt my whole body.
[06:36.43]Wow.
[06:40.10]I thought it was supposed to play static whenever it gets close to you.
[06:43.56]Jeez.
[06:49.75]Alright.
[06:51.87]We're going to do this again.
[06:52.77]Let me load it up again.
[07:01.95]We're doing Slender again.
[07:06.07]Yes, of course I want to run it.
[07:10.59]And... Honestly, like that, I really did not think that he was there.
[07:19.26]I really did not think he was there.
[07:21.12]How does that look?
[07:23.68]No, I didn't want to do that.
[07:24.64]I wanted to go to here.
[07:25.36]Okay, looks fine.
[07:29.73]Not a big surprise.
[07:34.33]Alright, looks good.
[07:35.69]Let's go.
[07:38.85]Drag you over here.
[07:42.81]See, the bad part about these, uh, these, like, SCP and Slender and stuff, if you try to hit escape or get, like, to a menu or something, you just close the game.
[07:51.01]So you have to, I have to be, uh, I have to be a little weird with it.
[07:55.44]Try to keep it on the side and drag the chat over.
[07:57.70]Hey!
[07:59.16]Do I want a hug?
[08:00.04]Yeah, I do.
[08:01.24]Especially after that.
[08:02.04]Alright, what'd I get?
[08:03.70]Three pages?
[08:04.24]Four pages?
[08:04.76]Yeah, that was great.
[08:05.52]Great job, Jeremy.
[08:06.64]You did a great job there.
[08:09.86]Let's go.
[08:16.32]Alright, I gotta get ready for this one.
[08:19.35]Last time I was stupid and I turned around and looked at him and said hello.
[08:28.70]Page one.
[08:29.84]Alright, I gotta think of a plan of action here before I pick this up.
[08:34.26]Where's the page?
[08:34.86]What the hell?
[08:36.13]Okay.
[08:37.37]There's the page one.
[08:38.69]I'm going to go straight through here.
[08:42.75]No, wait.
[08:43.11]Do I want to go there?
[08:43.91]Go straight down there.
[08:44.73]Let's see.
[08:45.86]We're going to go straight down there.
[08:48.40]Here we go.
[08:48.80]Ready?
[08:49.02]Go!
[08:52.38]You can't run.
[08:53.88]You can't hide.
[08:54.98]You can't get away from the Shinderman.
[08:57.49]Do I already hear static?
[09:02.91]I think I'm already here, so no I don't.
[09:04.65]Oh great, good thing I decided to run into a fence.
[09:06.37]Now I'm going to turn around and he's going to be right there.
[09:09.09]Cool!
[09:10.23]Great!
[09:26.72]I shouldn't have ran, that was a dumb idea.
[09:28.13]I should have sprinted.
[09:32.06]Oh, you know what I wish?
[09:32.60]I wish there was a stamina bar.
[09:34.12]Somebody said the stamina is hard to read.
[09:35.88]I wish there was a bar right there, like right on the screen, that said, oh, you have like this percentage or this amount.
[09:42.74]I just walked in a circle.
[09:53.75]Man, I hate this.
[09:55.77]I hate this guy.
[09:58.53]Where's, like, the gun?
[09:59.39]So I can turn around and just unload on his in touch.
[10:02.84]Static.
[10:03.96]Where's that water?
[10:05.04]I don't think there's water in this game.
[10:09.42]Oh, is that water or static?
[10:11.10]There's no water.
[10:11.84]I'm not looking behind me.
[10:16.03]I'm not making that same mistake.
[10:18.95]See, last time I looked behind me.
[10:21.11]That was a massive mistake.
[10:25.51]What are you guys saying?
[10:26.35]Let's see.
[10:28.53]drake jump and you can jump in this game I don't think you could jump I thought that was him right there by the way like whatever the hell that is oh we have some moss on the tree that's painted just like slenderman's body no I'm not looking behind me don't ever look behind you worst idea
[10:56.80]You know, as people talk about the spy in Slenderman, think about it.
[11:00.57]He's in a suit.
[11:02.13]He has, like, no face.
[11:03.17]He's got, like, a mask on.
[11:04.03]I don't know.
[11:04.53]Maybe he doesn't have a mask on, but... Tall guy in a suit that gets behind you.
[11:10.58]Slenderman is a spy.
[11:12.84]What?
[11:14.10]I hate being in here.
[11:15.90]Get... Oh!
[11:16.97]Hi!
[11:18.19]Fantastic!
[11:21.38]How you doing, man?
[11:22.14]Good to meet you.
[11:23.00]Get me out of this hellhole of a bathroom.
[11:25.20]I don't even care.
[11:26.44]Screw that friggin' paper.
[11:27.94]I don't even care.
[11:30.36]I'll lose the game.
[11:31.28]I don't even want to be in there.
[11:32.82]If I get stuck in there with him... I... I'm dead.
[11:37.64]It's over.
[11:38.02]I'm dead.
[11:38.71]I'm so dead right now.
[11:42.25]I'm gonna back up right into him and it's gonna scare me.
[11:44.27]I'm not gonna get scared.
[11:45.07]I'm not gonna get scared this time.
[11:46.09]I'm gonna look him right in his eyes.
[11:51.42]Run!
[11:51.68]I'm gonna get... I'm gonna spit that out.
[12:05.75]I was... If he jumped at me right there, I would've spit that all over my screen and the stream would've had to, like, end.
[12:10.63]Getting stuck on trees now.
[12:11.71]That's not cool.
[12:19.30]He's probably right behind me and it's gonna make that noise.
[12:27.49]Move faster, you piece of... There's so many things I could say right now.
[12:34.11]I don't even know what adjective to use.
[12:40.53]What's somebody say?
[12:41.23]Jerma is Slenderman?
[12:42.56]I don't know.
[12:42.86]I don't even know what that said.
[12:43.80]I'm too scared.
[12:46.97]There's another one right here.
[12:49.21]He's probably... This asshole is probably going to be standing right here.
[12:56.80]I wish I could just take my headphone out.
[12:58.24]Not if they hear this music.
[12:59.66]I'm going to have to turn around.
[13:03.22]Yeah, I got to turn around.
[13:06.86]Great.
[13:12.44]Is that him?
[13:13.16]No, it's not.
[13:13.72]Go.
[13:14.00]Go.
[13:19.98]I'm gonna I can't look I seriously can't look at the screen he's he's like to the left of me he's like right there and I I need to go that way
[13:47.99]This is the worst.
[13:49.79]Especially because I can't run anymore.
[13:51.23]This is it for Slender.
[14:00.64]I can't take Slender anymore.
[14:01.98]I can't take it anymore.
[14:04.36]When he's gonna... You know what?
[14:08.51]Screw this.
[14:09.03]You ready for this, guys?
[14:17.22]No, no, no, opening, opening.
[14:19.34]Make sure, you know, we're gonna just, we're gonna check.
[14:21.56]We're gonna do a quick check.
[14:23.92]Hey, where are you?
[14:24.65]You're right behind me.
[14:26.87]Yep, he's right behind me.
[14:29.23]You know, now I'm not so scared, because I know the son of a bitch is right behind me.
[14:33.59]And he's a slow slug.
[14:35.41]He ain't catching up to me.
[14:37.88]Good luck catching up to me.
[14:39.74]I got legs, I can run.
[14:42.14]He has legs too.
[14:44.34]What?
[14:48.62]What's that?
[14:49.46]Okay.
[14:51.98]He's definitely still right by me.
[14:53.30]I'm gonna grab it.
[14:54.14]Oh my god.
[14:59.93]I can feel him behind me.
[15:03.67]Is there a note there?
[15:04.45]I don't even care.
[15:09.93]I can't even turn to look and see if there's a note.
[15:11.46]I think there is.
[15:13.02]What if I do this?
[15:14.04]No.
[15:14.18]I'm just gonna keep moving.
[15:28.01]the note.
[15:28.29]I see it.
[15:30.53]Is that a note?
[15:32.15]It is.
[15:32.69]Okay, good.
[15:42.06]Grab the note.
[15:43.18]Grab the note.
[15:47.62]Hey!
[15:49.16]Can't run.
[15:50.00]Yeah, I wish I had more stamina.
[15:51.46]Oh, is that him?
[15:52.24]I don't know.
[15:52.62]I don't know.
[15:53.02]I don't know.
[15:53.66]I don't know.
[15:54.06]Who knows?
[15:54.38]I don't know, man.
[16:05.76]Did I already get the one on the tree?
[16:08.34]I don't remember.
[16:11.16]I don't know if I got the one on the tree.
[16:12.60]I don't think I did.
[16:19.41]Go.
[16:22.60]I don't want to turn around to grab this.
[16:25.42]Got it.
[16:25.86]Hello.
[16:33.77]It's gonna do it.
[16:34.55]He's right here.
[16:37.15]He's right here.
[16:37.71]I knew it.
[16:38.81]I knew it.
[16:39.41]See?
[16:39.53]I told you.
[16:40.13]I knew it.
[16:46.40]I knew it.
[16:47.24]I could feel him.
[16:48.16]I could feel him like right up my... He was grabbing onto my butt cheeks and squeezing them.
[16:54.28]That's like how much I felt him.
[16:59.54]Slender man.
[17:02.30]I'll punch Slender Man in his slender face.
[17:06.14]I'll knock his teeth out.
[17:09.42]What?
[17:11.83]Alright.
[17:12.31]I can't play Slender Man anymore.
[17:15.51]I can't play you anymore.
[17:16.53]I gotta move on to Containment Breach.
[17:21.21]We'll play Containment Breach.
[17:33.89]Actually, containment breach is probably worse than slender.
[17:43.90]Containment breach.
[17:46.59]Alright, this game is loud as hell.
[17:48.99]Memory access violation.
[17:52.05]What the hell does that mean?
[17:55.23]Hold on.
[17:59.12]What?
[18:01.88]Memory access violation.
[18:03.52]I'll give you a violation.
[18:08.22]I'll like park my car at double parking after 7 o'clock.
[18:12.02]And I'll get a violation.
[18:13.14]I'll show you.
[18:13.64]That was a bad joke.
[18:15.24]I apologize for that one.
[18:18.87]Alright, looks like we're playing SCP-087-B.
[18:21.91]Is next up on the list.
[18:26.33]Next up on the list.
[18:27.37]Let's do it.
[18:27.95]Here we go.
[18:31.64]Oh, wow, this is loud.
[18:33.44]This is loud.
[18:36.80]Gotta turn you down.
[18:38.14]Oh, God!
[18:39.66]Ow, my head.
[18:41.97]Wow, that's loud.
[18:43.29]You are loud as hell.
[18:44.71]Wow.
[18:47.15]Sorry about that.
[18:48.55]Uh, that was bad.
[18:49.35]That was loud.
[18:50.05]Why can't I... I'm, like, stuck in this godforsaken thing.
[18:58.60]Wait, wait.
[18:59.34]Oh, hey.
[19:00.22]Whoa.
[19:02.06]Hold on.
[19:02.78]Hold on a second.
[19:04.18]That was weird.
[19:05.98]That was weird.
[19:11.67]Well done.
[19:14.73]Yeah, I'm going to turn it down the window.
[19:15.75]Was that loud for all you guys too?
[19:17.19]That was like... I felt like somebody shot me in the side of the head.
[19:21.75]Okay, I can turn it down from here.
[19:29.46]Alright, let's do this again.
[19:33.91]In fact, I'm going to turn this all the way down.
[19:37.13]Let's see.
[19:49.06]Can I open that up?
[19:49.96]Open up.
[19:53.11]Alright.
[19:59.41]Oh, can I?
[20:00.35]No, no.
[20:00.81]Why am I stuck again?
[20:03.17]What in the name of gad?
[20:06.86]It keeps on locking up my mouse.
[20:08.58]And I can't change anything.
[20:12.16]Let's see if I can catch it quick.
[20:22.03]Yeah, I gotta make Direct Show go through.
[20:25.11]I know, it's a black screen.
[20:26.03]I'm sorry.
[20:31.24]Let's try this again.
[20:34.27]I gotta catch it right when it pops up.
[20:36.71]So I need this open.
[20:42.29]And... Come here, you.
[20:43.35]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[20:45.03]Oh, I had it!
[20:45.59]Move over here.
[20:52.26]So I can catch you quicker.
[20:58.02]Got it!
[20:58.62]No, now it's at zero!
[20:59.74]Damn it!
[21:02.03]I'll get it, I'll get it.
[21:05.62]There we go, okay.
[21:07.84]Bingo.
[21:10.18]Bingo.
[21:15.35]Please proceed with caution.
[21:18.75]Alright, here we go.
[21:23.58]087B.
[21:23.88]B is for ball.
[21:26.84]You know the rest.
[21:33.68]Going down the stairs.
[21:37.41]So this is like a hallway simulator and stuff jumps out at you and scares you and it's horrible.
[21:43.97]I don't like it.
[21:46.23]What are we at?
[21:49.79]Three?
[21:50.07]I don't want to go down there.
[21:58.15]Screw that.
[22:03.21]Screw that.
[22:09.14]087B.
[22:10.26]You are now entering... Whoa, hello.
[22:12.82]What the hell was that?
[22:15.92]It's been a long time since I played 087B, so I forget what happens.
[22:22.86]Four.
[22:29.93]It's been a while.
[22:39.23]Can I... Can I just say that... We live in the 21st century.
[22:44.73]How can you have a radio that sucks that bad?
[22:47.67]I mean, really, seriously, where did you get that radio?
[22:52.37]Dude, your radio sucks.
[22:53.76]Big time.
[22:55.06]You might want to replace the batteries.
[22:56.20]Why is everything getting all weird looking?
[22:58.34]What's going on?
[22:59.02]Why is... Is there something right here?
[23:09.24]Everything's changing.
[23:10.02]Everything looks weird now.
[23:14.90]Maybe I'm just going absolutely crazy.
[23:21.93]Floor 7.
[23:23.29]Oh, I don't know how much longer I can do scary games.
[23:27.79]Oh, hi.
[23:29.93]Thanks for closing in on me.
[23:31.41]I appreciate it.
[23:34.16]Come on.
[23:34.84]Something jump out at me.
[23:35.54]I'm ready.
[23:36.36]I'm ready.
[23:36.66]I'm ready to just throw up on my screen.
[23:38.90]Come on.
[23:40.94]I know what this means.
[23:41.76]I know what this means.
[23:42.60]Something's gonna happen right now.
[23:43.72]Something's gonna happen right now.
[23:44.64]I know it.
[23:45.90]I've been here before.
[23:46.84]We've been down this road before, man.
[23:48.80]Yeah?
[23:49.72]I see you.
[23:50.26]I see it.
[23:50.98]I can see it.
[24:02.03]What?
[24:03.21]Yeah, hi.
[24:08.14]What was that noise?
[24:09.68]What is going on?
[24:10.48]What is going on?
[24:11.50]I am ready to just jump and run.
[24:25.03]No?
[24:26.71]Floor number no.
[24:28.01]Okay.
[24:30.05]Hey!
[24:30.63]Whoa!
[24:31.30]Hi!
[24:34.06]Damn, man.
[24:34.88]Come on.
[24:36.02]Hey, how are you?
[24:36.98]How's your kids and your wife and your son?
[24:39.82]I heard he plays baseball now.
[24:41.26]Good to see him.
[24:41.82]Yeah, he's growing.
[24:42.90]He's big.
[24:50.94]I need the chat's help.
[24:51.78]Hold on.
[24:52.84]Chat, what do you think?
[24:56.02]What do I do?
[25:00.71]Alright, I have the support from the chat.
[25:02.69]I'm ready to play the game now.
[25:08.56]Oh, I don't even want to see it.
[25:09.50]I don't even want to see it.
[25:10.38]I know it's going to be... Was that a bug?
[25:13.50]What the hell was that?
[25:14.16]I don't know if you could just see that right there, but a bubble just came out of my mouth.
[25:20.15]A floating, like, soap bubble.
[25:24.21]Don't ask me how the hell that happened.
[25:30.82]God.
[25:33.08]I'm about to rage quit this game because I can't handle it.
[25:35.56]Because this game I know is horrible when it comes to things jumping at you.
[25:44.85]What if I just put my head down?
[25:50.27]Oh, man.
[25:50.95]This is probably worse than Slender.
[25:57.49]I'm about to hit escape.
[25:58.69]My hand is on escape right now.
[26:00.09]I'm about to just exit the game.
[26:05.72]My hand is on escape.
[26:08.50]The second I see something I don't like, I'm hitting it.
[26:14.58]Man.
[26:16.61]Come on, show me something scary so I can just insta-quit the game.
[26:24.31]It's throwing all kinds of noises.
[26:26.21]What?
[26:28.02]Bye!
[26:29.08]See you later!
[26:31.96]Have fun.
[26:32.84]Have fun, Slender Man, whatever the hell you are.
[26:42.18]Did you see that damn thing?
[26:45.64]It was like right here on the screen.
[26:48.78]That was hard.
[26:49.46]That was horrible.
[26:55.08]Oh, wow.
[27:05.26]So stupid oh Alright, give me a second get that one took a lot out of me right there oh I Think I might have to change my pants.
[27:28.78]Let's see.
[27:29.17]Let's let's let's check oh
[27:31.45]Nope, I'm fine.
[27:32.05]Alright, I need a break.
[27:38.28]I need like a five second break.
[27:41.32]I want to play Containment Breach.
[27:43.26]I don't know why I can't get it to load.
[27:45.12]Hold on, let me try loading this again.
[27:46.44]This is stupid.
[27:47.53]It should load.
[27:55.17]Open.
[27:56.03]Yes, I want you to run.
[27:56.77]No, why?
[27:57.79]I ran earlier.
[28:00.44]Hold on a second.
[28:01.64]Give me a second.
[28:05.50]Let me go.
[28:09.20]Options.
[28:12.32]Change this to 1600 by 900.
[28:15.10]I have it set to launcher.
[28:24.07]Let's do launcher.
[28:24.87]Okay, I think I got it.
[28:25.55]I'm going to get it.
[28:26.11]I got it.
[28:26.39]I'm going to get it, guys.
[28:29.03]Watch this magic right here.
[28:32.44]Watch this magic you're about to see right here.
[28:39.84]Are we ready for the magic?
[28:42.08]Here comes the magic.
[28:42.94]Here it comes.
[28:46.40]And for my next trick, I'm not going to be able to do the magic trick.
[28:49.08]Because it still doesn't work.
[28:52.75]Wait, wait, wait a second.
[28:53.99]I could get this to a hold on.
[28:58.10]Full screen false.
[28:59.74]Launcher enabled.
[29:00.72]Yeah.
[29:02.24]I mean, like, hello.
[29:03.38]Of course.
[29:13.37]Damn it.
[29:15.85]Yeah, I'm getting that memory access violation.
[29:18.70]Whatever the hell it is.
[29:20.85]Run it as administrator.
[29:21.83]Good call.
[29:22.61]Good call.
[29:23.91]Those of you that said that, good call.
[29:25.91]Because that's probably what's going to happen.
[29:27.05]It's going to work right now.
[29:32.44]I had this working too.
[29:34.46]I made sure it worked before I started the stream.
[29:36.54]And it worked.
[29:38.22]Now it's being a real piece of crap.
[29:41.70]Alright.
[29:41.94]Run as administrator.
[29:44.64]And that's what I want.
[29:48.22]That's what I want.
[29:49.32]Launch.
[29:51.90]Try it again.
[29:52.34]That's what I want.
[29:54.58]Launch.
[29:56.72]Nope.
[29:57.48]It's not going to launch.
[30:00.42]Oh.
[30:03.82]It looks like I'm going to have to drink a bunch of Dr. Pepper then.
[30:06.10]I mean, come on.
[30:13.58]What if I just like freaking puked?
[30:17.77]How many, like, people do you think would want to see that?
[30:20.89]If I was just like, oh, yeah, you know, let me just, like, drink some Dr. Pepper.
[30:25.97]I just, like, hurled all over the place.
[30:30.04]I wish I could see something like that.
[30:31.30]I would laugh my absolute ass off if I got to see something like that.
[30:38.03]I do.
[30:38.65]Me, me, me, me.
[30:40.55]That's so funny.
[30:41.81]Well, it looks like we're playing 087B again, which is my favorite game of all time.
[30:49.29]After this, I'm going to play some TF2.
[30:51.66]So, stick around.
[30:53.52]You're not going to want to miss this.
[30:57.26]I can't believe I'm loading this game up again.
[30:58.72]I did not want to play 087B again.
[31:01.50]I wanted to play it once, and that was it.
[31:05.07]I didn't want to have to do this damn game more than once.
[31:11.41]Here we go.
[31:11.91]It's going to be like... So, hey, prepare your ears.
[31:18.38]I'm warning you guys right now.
[31:19.96]Turn your headphones down because I got to catch this.
[31:23.12]If I don't catch it immediately, then it's going to be an issue.
[31:26.53]So, hold on.
[31:27.01]Give me a minute.
[31:27.39]Let me make sure the facecam is nice and big in the corner there.
[31:35.32]Here we go.
[31:38.31]I've got to make sure the mixer's here.
[31:39.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[31:44.09]Why does it say containment breach is in the background?
[31:47.11]Hold on a second.
[31:48.09]Hold on a second.
[31:50.70]One second here.
[31:53.12]I think the reason why it's screwing up is because it thinks it's running in the background.
[32:00.35]Oh, whatever.
[32:00.85]I don't want to waste your guys' time anymore.
[32:02.15]You guys have been patient.
[32:03.31]Let's do it.
[32:05.05]You guys have been patient.
[32:06.11]Let's do it.
[32:14.09]Here we go.
[32:17.41]Here we go.
[32:18.63]I'm just stalling as much as I can.
[32:21.22]Here we go.
[32:22.02]Oh, no.
[32:24.20]Super Crate Box?
[32:25.34]That's a great game.
[32:31.31]I don't want to click this button.
[32:32.31]I don't want to play this game again.
[32:33.31]But you know what?
[32:33.67]I'm going to play it again.
[32:34.51]Because you have to man up sometimes.
[32:37.19]And do it.
[32:38.51]So here we go.
[32:44.22]Alright.
[32:52.79]Please proceed with caution.
[32:54.43]Please.
[32:55.39]I'll give you.
[33:01.27]Oh, what's this?
[33:01.85]Oh, Smite.
[33:02.53]That game's fun.
[33:04.37]What if I just, like, don't look at the screen once?
[33:11.68]What the?
[33:12.40]See you later.
[33:13.00]Bye.
[33:14.12]No.
[33:15.54]No.
[33:16.58]No, I don't think so.
[33:18.44]I don't think so.
[33:19.10]I don't think so.
[33:22.18]See ya.
[33:24.10]That's not happening.
[33:27.96]Did you see that?
[33:29.98]It just was like... Alright, fine, fine, fine.
[33:35.06]We'll do it again.
[33:35.70]We'll do it again.
[33:36.18]I don't want two in there.
[33:50.43]If you missed what just happened... Something just flashed on the screen.
[33:55.71]Like a face just flashed in my face.
[33:59.30]I looked like the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland.
[34:07.00]What happens if I go down here?
[34:14.11]What?
[34:20.85]Third time's a charm, guys.
[34:26.50]I can't believe I...
[34:28.34]You gotta be kidding me.
[34:29.78]Oh, make sure you don't, like, fall down the hall and die.
[34:37.72]Let's go.
[34:38.12]This is gonna be the real one.
[34:41.00]I'm not gonna do any dumb mistakes, and I'm not gonna leave right off the bat.
[34:48.47]Yeah, I know.
[34:48.97]I'm pretty sure I know that that's where I am at this point.
[34:53.93]You don't have to keep telling me.
[34:56.48]Let me get, like, the dust off my screen, because it's making me think that there's stuff on there.
[35:05.18]You are now entering... That's from Gauntlet Legends.
[35:08.50]You are now entering the crypt of the Spider Kingdom, or something.
[35:13.26]Whatever it was.
[35:15.12]Just keep talking, and I won't be scared.
[35:16.76]Just keep talking.
[35:17.66]Just keep making noises with your mouth, and you won't be scared about things that are jumping out at you on the screen.
[35:22.22]Um...
[35:28.94]You know what?
[35:30.20]Man... I am just so sick of your... Why do you have to keep doing that?
[35:47.39]What?
[35:47.63]What?
[35:47.95]What is this?
[35:48.93]What the hell is this?
[35:49.61]Why is there... What's this... Stair... Why?
[35:53.42]Where am I?
[35:53.98]I don't have a flashlight.
[35:56.24]I don't even know where I am.
[35:59.21]Do I go in there or do I go over here?
[36:00.55]I don't know.
[36:01.71]I don't know.
[36:10.28]Do it with one eye.
[36:11.24]If I do it with one eye, it's not that bad.
[36:12.52]If I do it with one eye, it's still as bad.
[36:16.16]It's still just as bad with one eye.
[36:17.48]Forget that.
[36:18.62]Never mind what I just said.
[36:19.70]It's still just as bad with one eye closed.
[36:21.99]What about both eyes closed?
[36:24.45]But I can't see where I'm going.
[36:27.64]Things are getting weird looking again.
[36:28.86]Things are getting, like, green and, like, opaque and... Oh, this is it.
[36:34.11]Get me out of here.
[36:36.59]I have pinkies on escape.
[36:42.80]Stop it.
[36:46.10]Why?
[36:48.16]This is what happened last time, and then the thing jumped out at me.
[36:57.81]Floor 10.
[37:04.81]If you... I gotta think of a song, a nice happy song.
[37:08.34]Hold on.
[37:10.82]Raindrops keep falling on my head.
[37:14.53]No it's not.
[37:44.39]No!
[37:46.43]Just get... Oh, man, I hate this.
[37:51.80]I'm down pretty far.
[37:53.50]I didn't get down this far last time.
[37:55.24]I think I did.
[37:56.68]I don't remember.
[37:57.24]It's just a blur at this point.
[38:03.60]Fifteen.
[38:04.30]Itchy nose.
[38:08.32]Itchy nose.
[38:09.42]It's a way for me to pretend like I have an itchy nose so I can not look at the screen, kind of, really, maybe.
[38:15.19]me and get them.
[38:27.83]I'm not going down further.
[38:32.71]I'm not going down further than that.
[38:42.36]Containment breach.
[38:51.19]Like that, that, this game hurts my head.
[38:55.17]Wow.
[39:02.19]Oh.
[39:04.76]Beatbox the Halloween theme, but like the ding, ding, ding.
[39:07.32]Alright, I'll do that.
[39:07.94]Alright, well, how's it going?
[39:14.80]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[39:17.74]Alright, here we go.
[39:18.34]Ready?
[39:20.08]Let's see if I can do this.
[39:21.42]Because it's Halloween.
[39:24.30]Makes sense, right?
[39:27.02]Well, it's not Halloween right now, but it will be.
[39:35.13]Here we go.
[39:38.99]Here we go.
[39:49.15]I can't even do it.
[39:49.73]It's too hard.
[39:50.19]I'll slow it down.
[39:51.21]Hold on.
[39:52.42]There we go.
[39:53.02]That was better.
[39:53.82]That was a little bit better.
[39:55.30]I tried to do it way too fast the first time.
[39:57.44]That wasn't going to work.
[39:58.78]Alright.
