[00:00.03]Here we go.
[00:02.51]If this doesn't work, then I am going to quit streaming.
[00:14.88]So it has to work.
[00:15.86]You know what I'm saying?
[00:19.81]Here we go.
[00:20.23]Please work.
[00:20.95]Please work.
[00:21.63]Please work.
[00:22.27]Please work.
[00:22.95]Please work.
[00:23.63]Please work.
[00:28.55]Capture the whole thing.
[00:29.77]Why is, oh my God, I'm gonna fucking pee my pants on camera, I swear to God.
[00:43.30]Oh my fucking God, I hate computers.
[00:48.26]You gotta be shitting me.
[00:59.46]I can't play it in that fucking shitty little window, guys.
[01:05.30]And I can't even fix it because I have to... Nice resolution.
[01:12.00]I'm just installing another one.
[01:16.19]I can't believe that people are still here watching this mess.
[01:21.39]Nancy Drew's secrets can kill.
[01:23.23]Install it.
[01:44.75]If this doesn't work, I'm just gonna go to DOS.
[01:52.85]You look like a ghoul.
[01:55.09]I was about to just do a fucking ghoul scream into the camera.
[01:58.51]Like, right into the camera.
[02:07.79]Alright, Nancy Drew secrets could kill.
[02:09.41]Sure, yes.
[02:09.89]Just steam client.
[02:11.01]Strap in, whatever it's called.
[02:23.98]Alright, is this one gonna get captured?
[02:26.78]Is this the same thing as the last one?
[02:40.63]Why is Secrets of the Old Clock capturable now?
[03:00.90]This game fucking crushed.
[03:02.48]Nance.
[03:07.44]Hi, I'm Nancy Drew.
[03:09.14]This is my center of operations, my desk.
[03:12.02]Go ahead and poke around.
[03:13.52]If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do, take a look at the book.
[03:19.32]What?
[03:19.62]It's there, it's there, it's there, it's there.
[03:31.23]titled How to Be a Detective.
[03:33.07]It's real helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery solving.
[03:37.41]Shut up.
[03:38.05]Excuse.
[03:39.15]What?
[03:39.75]Excuse me, George.
[03:41.93]Excuse.
[03:43.39]Excuse me, giant human person, but you seem to be in business.
[03:47.40]And be sure to check out my scrapbook.
[03:49.42]I put memorabilia from all my past cases in there.
[03:52.50]A lot of them were pretty dangerous, and at times really scary.
[03:56.26]But don't say anything about that to my dad, okay?
[03:58.68]He worries about me enough as it is.
[04:00.94]And whatever you do, read what's in the file called Case File.
[04:04.88]That'll tell you all about the mystery I'm about to try to solve.
[04:08.38]If you think you're ready to dive into that mystery, just click on the plane ticket and you'll be on your way.
[04:13.52]Case file.
[04:13.98]Let's see.
[04:15.74]I got to change this to be what the actual thing is actually called.
[04:20.79]Secrets can kill.
[04:21.47]All right.
[04:24.23]Sorry for having you sit there for like 15 straight minutes of like a black screen.
[04:29.91]Let me just change the stream info to secrets can kill.
[04:42.24]Here we go.
[04:45.80]A student named Jake Rogers was killed at a high school last week.
[04:48.94]What?
[04:49.62]An undercover detective by the name of Beach asked Aunt Eloise if I could go undercover to investigate the murder.
[04:57.69]I'm posing as a new student to see what the other kids may know about Jake and his untimely end.
[05:04.93]I'm posing as a new student?
[05:06.59]Wait, how old am I?
[05:14.08]Check out how to be a detective.
[05:26.89]Time to close the book.
[05:41.75]What the fuck, man?
[05:51.88]Okay.
[05:52.98]Hi, I'm Nancy.
[05:54.40]Shut up.
[05:55.00]Okay, give me the plane ticket.
[05:57.82]Put down the book.
[05:59.18]Put the book down.
[06:00.78]Put the book down, Nancy.
[06:02.32]Put the book down.
[06:03.02]How do I put down the book?
[06:08.42]Oh my god.
[06:15.31]Dear Dad, who would have dreamed taking a vacation to visit Aunt Eloise in Florida would result in another case?
[06:21.59]Seems a student named Jake Rogers was murdered at the high school last week.
[06:26.09]And an undercover police detective wants me to pose as a student to search for any leads at the school.
[06:31.91]So it's undercover I go.
[06:34.11]I'm calling this case Secrets Can Kill.
[06:37.11]Love, Nancy.
[06:37.85]Uh, all right.
[06:46.18]Nancy, I had to close the school library early today, but if you need to do any research for your case, the key to the library is in the safe.
[06:51.12]Remember not to enter in a wrong combination.
[06:53.86]Why is that underlined?
[06:59.64]Is it going to explode?
[07:02.04]Why would you write that?
[07:02.96]6-0-K-S
[07:14.61]Is this my diploma?
[07:19.93]Why would I have my diploma folded up into a drawer?
[07:22.17]Don't you put that shit on the back of your wall?
[07:38.72]Oh, what was six?
[07:39.98]O-K-S, right?
[07:47.66]That's not correct?
[07:50.10]Was it 6-O-K-S?
[07:51.54]There it is.
[07:51.92]Ooh, key.
[08:16.28]Oh, fuck me.
[08:18.47]Okay, I got it.
[08:19.25]What is going on here?
[08:21.99]No, that's not... That's incorrect.
[08:24.23]Uh, it's gotta be...
[08:56.62]This has got to come down.
[08:57.42]Is this all the way to the... What?
[09:01.22]Is it... This is the top right corner.
[09:07.16]Alright, so this is... I got it.
[09:37.23]Alright, I'm getting there.
[09:39.13]This is her face, right?
[09:40.23]Yep.
[09:45.61]Alright, hold on.
[09:53.33]Is it gonna come down?
[09:53.93]Alright, now... I hate these types of puzzles.
[10:08.60]Yeah, like, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're sorry, they're... I'm keeping them together.
[10:38.12]Alright, alright.
[10:38.74]Now, I gotta get this.
[10:40.00]I'm gonna have an aneurysm by this- Oh!
[10:46.50]You're fine.
[10:46.86]Don't worry.
[11:00.99]This has to be up?
[11:06.76]This is all the way... Alright, that goes up here.
[11:24.73]I'm so close, but so far away at the same time.
[11:32.79]Where is... This goes to the left.
[11:35.70]Right?
[11:36.50]Yeah.
[11:36.84]You motherfucker.
[11:42.50]It's right there.
[11:44.60]All right.
[12:09.31]So close so close I can fix this shit later
[12:50.44]What?
[12:51.02]Oh, you have to be down.
[12:55.03]Okay, hold on.
[12:55.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[12:58.59]He's not a senior detective.
[13:00.39]I'm fine.
[13:01.17]I have to get this shit over here.
[13:03.93]Alright, I had it.
[13:34.95]What?
[13:35.17]I'm almost there, guys!
[13:50.63]I have it, I'm almost done.
[14:28.44]I'm just going in fucking circles.
[14:30.90]One guy that said, I hate these things.
[14:33.82]They are the worst.
[14:35.01]They really are the fucking worst.
[14:38.43]I hate them.
[14:46.87]It's so close.
[14:48.14]It's so close.
[14:48.98]It's almost here.
[14:49.86]It's ready.
[14:52.33]But there needs to be food.
[15:42.61]I just had it and I fucked it up.
[15:52.22]Wait, hold on.
[16:21.46]I know it's easy, but like I'm fucking so done.
[16:28.89]I'm trying to solve it!
[16:39.47]I'm about to- I'm about to just hold the power button on my computer.
[16:41.65]I'm about to hold the power button on the computer and just tell Steve tomorrow.
[16:45.28]I'm about to hold the power button.
[16:49.82]Alright, shhh.
[16:57.15]Okay, so...
[17:12.22]It just needs to be up here.
[17:41.51]I know.
[17:42.23]Look, it's like the streamer curse, okay?
[17:45.56]If I was lying in bed doing this, I could probably do this in five seconds.
[18:33.17]I was seconds away from holding down the power button, I promise.
[18:45.12]Okay, login name.
[18:46.40]Eloise Drew.
[18:47.24]Password, O Wise Elder.
[18:48.76]School computer.
[18:51.32]Okay, got it.
[19:02.91]What a pain in the ass that was.
[19:05.03]All right, let's go.
[19:08.71]Nancy Drew, Detective Beach here.
[19:10.25]How are you?
[19:11.25]Good, and yourself?
[19:12.75]Frustrated, Nancy.
[19:13.94]I need some leads, and you're my man.
[19:15.44]Well, woman, teen, student, whatever.
[19:18.44]I'll be at Maxine's diner.
[19:20.12]Come see me when you've found out anything.
[19:22.10]All contact should be through me.
[19:24.16]Can do.
[19:25.24]So what's our cover?
[19:26.98]Our what?
[19:28.06]Um, our cover.
[19:29.74]Who should I say you are if anyone sees us and asks?
[19:33.22]Oh, right.
[19:34.30]I'll be your uncle.
[19:35.60]Uncle Steve.
[19:37.22]I gotta go now.
[19:38.02]If you need anything else, come see me at Maxine's.
[19:41.08]I'm wearing glasses and a green striped shirt.
[19:43.38]So I'm pretending to be a high schooler, and this guy's pretending to be my uncle.
[19:50.21]What the hell?
[19:58.17]Welcome to Maxine's.
[19:59.71]I'm Daryl Gray.
[20:01.03]I don't think I've seen you here before.
[20:03.07]My name's Nancy Drew.
[20:04.19]I just moved down here.
[20:06.23]Then you'll be attending Paseo Del Mar High.
[20:09.03]I'm your student council president.
[20:10.76]If there's anything you need, just let me know.
[20:13.62]Thanks.
[20:14.16]I might just take you up on that offer.
[20:16.72]So, what can I do for you?
[20:20.65]Tell me about the high school.
[20:24.68]What happened?
[20:25.32]Is he pretending to be a student, too?
[20:28.12]We're all pretending to be students?
[20:29.36]We're all just detectives?
[20:31.04]Wait, what?
[20:53.67]Who did it?
[20:55.13]No one knows.
[20:56.15]And the police are keeping pretty clammed up about it.
[20:59.03]But my resources say they're calling in some special detective.
[21:03.03]Maybe even the FBI.
[21:04.89]That's me, right?
[21:07.00]Wow.
[21:07.70]You must have some special contacts.
[21:11.32]Just special enough to see beautiful women like yourself.
[21:17.12]What do you mean?
[21:18.74]Get it?
[21:19.78]Contacts?
[21:20.88]I'm wearing contacts that let me see pretty women?
[21:23.82]I can't- I don't- I don't know you have contacts in.
[21:25.59]How do- yeah, that's something I didn't have- that's not prior to- I should get back to work.
[21:29.57]Nice meeting you, Nancy.
[21:32.85]Bye.
[21:33.87]Later.
[21:34.15]I don't have enough money.
[21:38.78]What?
[21:42.00]I can't play Barnacle Blast?
[21:43.40]Are you serious?
[21:44.76]That's a shame.
[21:57.32]That makes a cool sound.
[22:00.32]Let's find our uncle who's hanging out somewhere in the diner.
[22:07.28]Uncle Steve!
[22:08.80]Nancy!
[22:09.98]Why, I haven't seen you since... Elijah!
[22:13.83]For a long time.
[22:14.79]How's your... Aunt.
[22:18.37]Aunt Eloise.
[22:20.05]Oh, she's fine.
[22:21.51]And Dad says hello.
[22:23.29]You're staying with your aunt, right?
[22:25.10]Yes.
[22:26.38]So, uh, what do you got for me?
[22:28.81]Well, I was hoping you could debrief me on the investigation.
[22:31.75]Oh, sure, sure, sure.
[22:34.83]I'm just a bit... Well, my undercover assignments are usually not so... suburban.
[22:41.41]I understand.
[22:42.79]The victim was a senior named Jake Rogers.
[22:45.71]As usual, none of the family, teachers, or students know about any enemies he may have had.
[22:50.49]Nothing came up from searching his home, computer, cell phone, or locker.
[22:54.11]His bank records tell a different story.
[22:55.95]Bank records?
[22:56.67]He had a fairly large savings account and a lot of cash deposits.
[23:00.21]We suspect he was involved in something shady.
[23:03.01]Drugs, gambling, or blackmail.
[23:05.29]That's where you fit in.
[23:06.81]Talk to the students and see what you can find out.
[23:09.55]We think he might have kept information about his activities in a notebook or journal.
[23:13.56]So keep a lookout for anything like that.
[23:15.70]Anything else?
[23:17.30]Bye, Uncle Steve.
[23:18.72]Goodbye, Nancy.
[23:21.23]Okay.
[23:22.35]Uh, any food on the table?
[23:23.49]Anything I can grab?
[23:24.41]Any slide puzzles for me to almost turn my computer off?
[23:27.63]I ripped the plug out of the wall.
[23:30.52]Looking for another slide puzzle.
[23:34.14]What about over here?
[23:35.30]Oh, this is my house.
[23:41.11]Okay.
[23:51.98]Homecoming.
[23:52.54]I thought this was a golf club.
[23:56.66]Surf club is cool.
[23:57.92]That's cool.
[23:58.42]Is this the locker?
[24:05.62]Alright, uh... I don't know this information yet.
[24:10.15]Alright, is this the gym?
[24:18.05]Homecoming.
[24:23.40]Alright, what is that for?
[24:47.72]Okay, for a second I thought that their mascot was a sock with boxing gloves.
[24:53.42]Like, that's... What a dumb mascot.
[25:05.24]Extra pop, grape, orange, soda, cool, or spot cola.
[25:12.16]I would love to have a sip of cool cola.
[25:17.53]Soda Pop?
[25:18.55]This is probably a puzzle.
[25:20.63]Spot Cola.
[25:21.59]Cool Soda.
[25:23.15]Orange Soda.
[25:24.36]Grape Soda.
[25:26.82]Grape Orange Cool Soda.
[25:29.46]No.
[25:30.72]I need money.
[25:36.03]Out of order?
[25:36.79]Why do things keep costing money?
[25:40.36]Holy shit, you just kind of... Whoa, a new girl at school.
[25:44.18]Do you realize what destiny has brought you today?
[25:46.82]Yours truly, Hector Sanchez.
[25:48.89]But you can just call me the Hulk.
[25:53.93]The Hulk?
[25:54.31]You are new around here.
[25:55.85]I play for the Manatees, one of the best teams in the state.
[25:59.29]I leave the others in the dirt, man.
[26:01.18]Soon it's college ball, and then the pros.
[26:04.20]Showtime.
[26:06.67]Who are the manatees?
[26:08.45]Paseo Del Mar's mascot is a manatee.
[26:10.90]Don't tell me you're afraid of a little sea cow.
[26:13.32]Of course not.
[26:14.06]I know what to do if I come across a manatee.
[26:15.90]Why would you immediately talk about how you would fight and punch one and hurt one?
[26:21.14]Of course not.
[26:22.14]I know what to do if I come across a manatee.
[26:25.27]Yeah, just sneeze and it'll swim away.
[26:28.01]Seriously, the manatees are a great team at a great school.
[26:31.31]Everyone is cool, except for a few punks like Jake Rogers.
[26:35.31]Jake Rogers?
[26:37.01]I knew Jake, but I didn't hang out with him.
[26:41.37]Sorry, can't talk now.
[26:42.61]I gotta go to practice.
[26:43.89]Later.
[26:53.48]You name-dropped the only person who died.
[26:59.62]Yeah, this school's pretty cool, except Jake Roberts sucks.
[27:02.56]I hate him.
[27:03.92]Oh, okay.
[27:04.70]You know, he's dead.
[27:06.86]Oh.
[27:08.20]Yeah, well, welcome to the school.
[27:12.25]How's it going?
[27:14.73]How could I get into Jake's locker?
[27:17.05]I could tear the door off with my teeth, but it just might be easier to ask Hal Tanaka.
[27:21.59]His locker was right next to Jake's.
[27:23.21]Okay.
[27:24.81]What can you tell me about Daryl Gray?
[27:27.44]He seems like a cool guy.
[27:28.52]His family used to sponsor the annual football awards dinner until last year.
[27:32.96]You know, he's the one who found Jake's body.
[27:35.46]Wait, what?
[27:38.72]Hold on.
[27:39.94]I'm so lost right now.
[27:44.91]He knows that this guy's dead.
[27:50.35]He talked about how much he sucks.
[27:53.95]And now he's like, oh, yeah, that's where the body was.
[28:01.17]I'll talk to you later.
[28:02.49]That's a psycho.
[28:03.31]Yeah, this is a psychopath.
[28:06.27]You, like, checked every box of are you a psychopath or not.
[28:11.05]Alright, we gotta find... Where's this, uh... Look in the trash?
[28:16.89]Eye test.
[28:17.31]Eevee.
[28:19.43]I'll do it.
[28:26.64]I'll do the eye test.
[28:27.32]Let's see how good I do.
[28:44.21]E-V-I-F-O-R E-Z-E-E R-H-T-E-G A-P-K-O-O-B-Y R-T-C-Z-M N-M-C-Z-M
[29:08.66]N, J, K, O, O, L, K, M, O, T, E, M. I don't know.
[29:20.38]B, F, F, A, L, E, E, U, L, K, Y, K, A, A, P, I. Go to the doctor.
[29:41.86]No, now I can't do this.
[29:44.34]You know, okay, when you go, okay, Jeremy, please cover one eye and do it.
[29:48.00]And you cover one eye and you do it.
[29:49.05]And then it's like, oh, do the other eye.
[29:50.23]And it's like, I can't.
[29:52.85]It's all blurry.
[29:53.51]You can only do this once.
[29:57.63]You actually can only do that test one time.
[29:59.29]You can't do the other eye.
[30:00.27]Because my eye otherwise is like all fucked up and blurry and shit.
[30:05.64]You got about half of that wrong.
[30:08.70]Well, maybe down by the bottom.
[30:14.74]Don't press it.
[30:16.02]No, it's the light coming back into your eye.
[30:18.94]It's like all blurry and smushed.
[30:21.68]Go to a doctor.
[30:22.44]What are you talking about?
[30:23.19]Go to a doctor.
[30:29.95]What are you talking about?
[30:30.87]I'm fine.
[30:31.45]All right.
[30:36.97]Please go to a doctor.
[30:37.87]That shouldn't happen.
[30:38.75]What are you... What?
[30:41.88]When I cover one eye, and then I do cover one eye for long enough, and I take my hand off that eye and I cover it, it's like this eye that was covered is all fucked up.
[30:51.70]Bro, don't you have a hernia?
[30:52.84]Yeah.
[30:54.65]It sucks.
[31:02.47]Okay, I found a coin.
[31:03.11]Let's go get a drink.
[31:11.55]The drink is not in the women's bathroom.
[31:18.63]How do I get the hell out of here?
[31:19.83]Alright, drink.
[31:22.17]I want a... What should I get?
[31:23.81]Cool soda?
[31:27.12]Or should I get extra pop?
[31:28.28]I think... Yeah, cool soda.
[31:30.24]Definitely.
[31:34.22]That is wasted quarter.
[31:43.60]Alright, we gotta go talk to this, uh, whoever was the locker?
[31:52.17]Where would I find this person?
[31:54.91]Learning is the only thing the mind never exhausts, never fears, and never regrets.
[32:00.04]Da Vinci.
[32:12.51]Thank you, DaVinci.
[32:13.35]Very nice.
[32:13.87]Yes.
[32:14.41]Thank you, DaVinci.
[32:19.09]Danger.
[32:19.57]Admittance to authorized personnel only.
[32:21.23]What do you mean, danger?
[32:22.09]Is this like a high voltage room back here?
[32:29.29]Alright, hold on.
[32:29.91]This is a puzzle?
[32:30.44]Oh, I don't know the code.
[32:35.66]Alright, I remember that's here.
[32:45.03]Ooh, okay.
[32:46.99]Hi, I'm Connie.
[32:47.79]You're not from around here, are you?
[32:50.11]Usually, Paseo Del Mar High is really quiet and boring.
[32:53.11]Connie, where'd you get that?
[32:53.75]Lately, it's been totally out of control.
[32:55.37]I want one of those.
[32:58.19]Where do I get this?
[32:59.51]They don't have that here.
[33:00.32]They don't sell that here.
[33:00.98]You brought that in from home.
[33:03.16]No outside food or drink allowed.
[33:04.94]I'm reporting you to the hall monitor.
[33:10.62]Out of control?
[33:12.16]One of the students was killed last week.
[33:16.81]Who was killed?
[33:18.37]Oh, just this wannabe stud named Jake Rogers.
[33:20.75]Why would people keep talking this?
[33:21.73]What do you mean?
[33:22.97]Jake Rogers was a total creep.
[33:24.99]Nobody liked him.
[33:25.81]I gotta go now.
[33:27.55]Later.
[33:30.58]Oh my god.
[33:35.34]Didn't he just get thrown down a flight of stairs and died?
[33:39.30]Hey Nancy, need something?
[33:42.59]What do you know about Hulk Sanchez?
[33:45.14]He's a big jock on campus.
[33:46.98]Never dated him or anything.
[33:48.60]Why do we need that info?
[33:49.49]Why do you have to say that?
[33:52.35]I don't... I don't need that info.
[33:55.39]Hey, who is this person?
[33:56.55]Oh, you know, he's a jock.
[33:57.41]I never dated him, though.
[33:59.50]Alright?
[34:00.46]That... Okay.
[34:03.76]I just asked you who he was.
[34:07.94]How well do you know Daryl Gray?
[34:10.52]I wish I knew him better.
[34:11.44]They both did it.
[34:12.22]He's the only guy I'd ever consider dating.
[34:14.86]He's student council president, holds a cool job at a diner called Maxine's, and drives a Seaback X8.
[34:20.04]Really, really hammering down the, like, who I'm going to date.
[34:22.35]Drives a sports car and works at a diner?
[34:24.47]That doesn't compute.
[34:26.29]Yeah, I don't get it either.
[34:27.95]Daryl's family was rich and used to throw major parties all the time, but not anymore.
[34:31.45]What is that?
[34:35.60]I'll talk to you later.
[34:37.00]Bye, Nancy.
[34:38.75]What's that around her neck?
[34:39.87]Is it like a medal?
[34:40.93]Is it like a gold medal?
[34:42.07]What is that?
[34:43.29]Hey, Nancy.
[34:44.03]Need something?
[34:45.59]See you later.
[34:46.67]Bye, Nancy.
[34:47.47]It's an Olympic medal.
[34:48.69]Is it?
[34:55.73]Magazine puzzle?
[35:01.94]Connie the Olympian.
[35:06.90]Paseo Students of the Month.

[35:42.37]Alright, so maybe I need to remember this.
[35:47.55]Alright, well we know that now.
[35:52.01]Let's go in here.
[35:53.62]I'm going in.
[35:54.80]I'm old enough to go in here.
[35:56.60]I'm like 37.
[35:56.90]Oops, sorry.
[35:57.36]Blew my cover.
[35:57.94]Wait, that was a shiny thing.
[36:09.71]Oh, a quarter.
[36:10.31]Am I gonna softlock myself?
[36:31.23]She did it.
[36:32.23]I didn't do it.
[36:32.95]She did.
[36:35.61]She did it.
[36:42.87]Ooh, a quarter!
[36:55.81]Can I nominate that?
[37:02.29]Ooh!
[37:03.01]Another quarter!
[37:06.99]No, I might need this.
[37:11.34]Alright, I have to find this other student.
[37:21.87]Debate team.
[37:23.62]Math team.
[37:28.74]Oh!
[37:29.95]Hi, my name's Nancy Drew.
[37:31.65]What's your name?
[37:32.99]Al Tanaka.
[37:34.31]Actually, my first name is much longer than that.
[37:37.15]But I want to fit in here in America, so I chose Hal as my nickname.
[37:41.75]I'm a Japanese exchange student.
[37:44.27]Why do you think it's easier to have an American name?
[37:47.39]I want to be part of the culture and succeed in this country.
[37:50.33]Are you going to stay in America?
[37:54.70]Do you plan on staying in America after you finish high school?
[37:57.97]My family is counting on me to succeed here.
[38:00.57]I must make them proud of me.
[38:02.71]That's your favorite soda.
[38:05.19]So what's been going on at school lately?
[38:07.17]A murder was committed here.
[38:09.67]Everyone is very stressed out.
[38:11.57]All right, so we have a little bit of actual human being here.
[38:20.02]I heard about that.
[38:21.38]Some kid named Jake.
[38:23.44]Oh yeah, Jake Rogers was a dark soul.
[38:27.09]He created a lot of trouble.
[38:29.99]What do you mean a dark soul?
[38:33.44]What do you mean by dark soul?
[38:35.84]Jake wasn't a happy person and made others around him very unhappy too.
[38:40.49]How did Jake make people around him unhappy?
[38:43.33]Jake was an Ichimeko.
[38:46.20]In English, you would say a bully.
[38:48.98]He wasn't very popular.
[38:50.52]I'm behind in my studies and I must get back to the library.
[38:52.88]Bye, Nancy.
[38:53.46]He was the dark souls of high school students.
[38:59.38]Okay, can I... What's the combination to Jake's locker?
[39:06.84]Do you know the combination to Jake Rogers' locker?
[39:09.98]I'm sorry, Nancy.
[39:11.58]I can't help you with that.
[39:13.64]How do you not know the combination?
[39:14.78]Hoke said your locker's right next to Jake's.
[39:17.10]Are you sure you don't know the combination?
[39:18.96]Hmm.
[39:21.02]I remember one day, Jake was mad because he couldn't open his locker.
[39:24.87]He told me he wished he had a phone handy.
[39:27.53]Would that help?
[39:29.21]He wished he had a phone handy?
[39:30.85]He told me he wished he had a phone...
[39:38.94]To do math?
[39:41.67]Have you heard of Hulk Sanchez?
[39:43.89]Hmm, interesting.
[39:44.49]Do you know Connie Watson?
[40:10.71]Yes, we've been in a few classes together.
[40:13.40]I think she was dating Jake Rogers.
[40:17.50]Yeah, where is this looking out to?
[40:22.56]They need to mow the grass.
[40:24.55]That shit is getting wild.
[40:25.81]Like his father?
[40:37.28]Like his father?
[40:38.15]I hear he was a great politician, but not a very good businessman.
[40:43.27]I think his company went bankrupt a few years ago.
[40:46.93]See ya.
[40:47.93]See you later, Nancy.
[40:49.23]Here's my phone.
[40:51.47]He wanted a phone. ...
[41:08.89]Okay.
[41:13.65]Holy shit, Nancy, you don't have very many people on your phone.
[41:18.47]That's it, just Ned.
[41:21.25]Only Ned.
[41:24.73]Hello, is this Martha Winterglassen?
[41:27.93]Who is please calling me?
[41:29.19]Um, no.
[41:30.96]What?
[41:31.32]I'm trying to reach Ned Nickerson.
[41:33.72]Nancy, it's Ned.
[41:34.96]I thought with you being undercover and everything, I had to take on a different persona.
[41:38.96]Ned?
[41:39.84]I'm the one who's undercover, not you.
[41:42.22]Okay, okay.
[41:43.16]I guess I'll just go undercover vicariously through you, which for some odd reason feels very deja vu-ish.
[41:47.94]Do we ever get to see Ned?
[41:49.38]Does he ever show up anywhere?
[41:50.40]It'd probably be a good idea if you didn't mention my assignment to anyone.
[41:54.27]You never know who may be related to this case, even up at Emerson.
[41:58.29]Your secret's safe with me, along with your heart.
[42:01.55]You're such a sweetie.
[42:03.19]Have we even seen each other in real life?
[42:04.55]I feel like we haven't.
[42:05.18]Because I'm playing as a senior detective, I don't need a task list.
[42:08.00]What?
[42:08.20]Are you kidding me?
[42:34.18]Alright, what's crumpled up here?
[42:35.98]Another coin?
[42:36.56]Cool.
[42:39.54]Another coin in the trash?
[42:40.94]I got a lot of coins now.
[42:43.86]Alright, let's go back to the locker and see what the hell's going on here.
[42:46.45]Alright, he wanted- he needed a phone.
[42:54.81]Why did he want a phone?
[43:01.10]He needed a phone.
[43:06.03]Hmm.
[43:07.09]Why would he need a phone for this?
[43:24.00]Maybe the code is clo- yeah, maybe it's like... Why would you put a picture of your
[43:34.37]Maybe take the phone out here?
[43:39.42]Zoom?
[43:40.14]I don't know.
[43:40.54]Is there anything over here?
[43:43.78]Get Hulk to rip the door off.
[43:48.16]Maybe it's his phone number.
[43:50.50]The last four digits?
[43:51.84]I don't think I have that info, though.
[43:59.21]Who am I calling?
[44:03.53]She hangs up, who hung up?
[44:08.16]It's dude, Jake.
[44:34.47]Oh, shit.
[44:35.59]It was Jake.
[44:41.21]A treatise on etiquette.
[44:45.25]There's a ripped up piece of paper in here.
[44:50.11]What else we got?
[44:53.39]T-120.
[44:53.83]Oh, there's a tape.
[44:56.49]Tape is gone, though.
[44:59.74]Alright, I don't know anything about Judo.
[45:02.38]Who's winning here?
[45:28.87]Is this guy doing a huge flip over the other guy and ripping him forward, or is the other guy throwing him over the shoulder?
[45:35.51]I don't know who's winning.
[45:48.09]Ooh, breaking at local pharmacy.
[45:53.08]Paseo County police responded to a break-in at the drug station pharmacy on 80th Street in the early morning hours yesterday.
[45:58.80]Whoever it was knew exactly what they were looking for.
[46:02.43]They broke in the building through the back window, took the drugs, and were out for minutes.
[46:07.11]According to the report, several vials of hectanol were taken.
[46:12.07]We were just lucky that no other damage was done to the store.
[46:14.41]What is hectanol?
[46:19.05]Why was there a coin in the A?
[46:22.65]Alright, so we got... Break into the pharmacy.
[46:26.31]Let's go talk to the pharmacy.
[46:30.80]Let's go... Alright, let's go talk to the pharmacy.
[46:41.71]Wait!
[46:44.19]Let's go.
[46:50.41]Ahoy, matey.
[46:51.61]Your job be to scrub our barnacle-ridden decks by blasting them out of the way with your magic ball.
[46:56.86]But be on the lookout for creatures and objects with special powers.
[47:01.32]Scrubbing a chest increases your paddle size.
[47:03.22]Scrubbing a mine decreases.
[47:05.94]Scrubbing an anemone slows down the magic ball.
[47:09.14]Scrubbing a whirlpool speeds it up.
[47:10.70]So don't touch the mines and get away from the whirlpools.
[47:31.73]You know what they haven't made in a long time?
[47:34.73]A updated cool version of this game.
[47:40.48]They keep making the same iPad version.
[47:45.18]No, not Peggle, uh, Breakout.
[47:57.27]Pool Breakout?
[47:57.97]Yeah.
[47:59.91]I remember the best part about Breakout is when you beat a level, and the ball stayed up top, and you just let it just auto-play, and have it just take out, it just got stuck on the top row, and almost the whole level would get completed.
[48:11.84]Let's see if we can do it.
[48:14.10]Do it.
[48:15.70]Oh, come on.
[48:19.00]How many levels are there?
[48:29.76]Get stuck up there.
[48:31.58]Oh wow, this made it real easy.
[48:35.08]This is an amateur detective, not a master detective anymore.
[48:37.86]Fuck.
[48:43.24]It's a 40-hour minigame.
[48:44.46]Do I get anything for doing this?
[48:48.12]I lost.
[48:48.54]Yeah, it's okay.
[48:59.34]You lost our respect.
[49:03.52]Don't worry.
[49:03.88]I'll get it back.
[49:06.48]I'll get it back when I bag the killer for who threw Jake down the stairs.
[49:14.38]Probably not tonight, though.
[49:15.66]Because this is probably like a 16-hour game.
[49:19.34]And we're doing hopefully no more heroes tomorrow.
[49:28.51]Oh, nice.
[49:29.13]All right, I can make this work.
[49:31.11]Get in there.
[49:31.61]Come on, get in.
[49:32.33]In, in, in.
[49:33.29]No, in, in.
[49:34.57]Oh, it's over.
[49:35.09]I ruined it.
[49:50.83]It's all right.
[49:51.25]Is this 700,000 games?
[49:55.83]It's probably better than what's on that disc.
[50:00.67]Is this available on Steam?
[50:01.68]Yeah, it is.
[50:10.39]I think all of them are.
[50:11.64]At least most of them.
[50:27.98]This is nice.
[50:28.54]I actually am really... I'm just kind of relaxing now.
[50:42.49]That's... yeah, that was pretty good sync.
[50:45.01]I'm gonna say there's probably five levels.
[50:46.87]And I'm never doing this again, so might as well try to beat it.
[50:49.70]And get the achievement at the end of the game.
[50:53.98]We need to unwind after that slide puzzle.
[50:58.59]Yeah, we needed a good unwind.
[51:07.10]Which in itself should be an unwind, but it wasn't.
[51:12.31]I can't believe I almost turned the power button off on my computer.
[51:16.37]I was gonna do it too, and I'm gonna be like, fuck it, I'll see you tomorrow.
[51:31.62]Almost makes you forget that someone was murdered.
[51:37.76]Yeah, as a detective, I shouldn't be doing this.
[51:41.21]Shouldn't I have dusted this thing for fingerprints?
[51:47.57]Oh my god, how many levels are there?
[51:56.37]I want to get up there!
[51:59.09]Come on, do it!
[52:02.08]Get up there.
[52:02.92]Ugh.
[52:03.84]Get up there.
[52:05.26]Get up there.
[52:17.23]Do I have ten lives?
[52:18.55]This is never gonna end.
[52:26.38]If I could turn my camera on right now, I would.
[52:32.67]I don't do this very often, but I'm doing it right now.
[52:42.84]I'm leaning forward on my desk with my left hand.
[52:46.08]My left elbow is on the desk, and my left hand is on my chin in a fist, just kind of hanging up.
[52:59.57]Why wouldn't I look?
[53:01.52]I wasn't even looking.
[53:02.36]I looked away.
[53:04.60]Now I know why no one's made another version of this game.
[53:06.72]Because after five levels, you're like, alright, I'm done.
[53:09.32]There's a reason why no one has revolutionized the Breakout game.
[53:32.23]Battle Royale Breakout?
[53:33.33]Alright, there can't be more than 10 levels.
[53:44.54]You're killing me.
[53:45.96]You're killing me.
[53:46.74]Come on.
[53:48.42]Alright.
[53:49.89]Level 6.
[53:51.87]What does that say?
[53:52.45]80... 80 what?
[53:54.07]What?
[54:02.68]I gotta sit up.
[54:03.32]Alright, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.
[54:05.64]I'm starting to not care.
[54:06.44]I have to care.
[54:10.28]Does bond?
[54:11.04]I wonder if that's a code or something.
[54:13.53]Maybe that is a code for something.
[54:25.70]I want pizza so bad.
[54:26.82]I don't... What is it with streaming?
[54:30.65]It's something about streaming.
[54:32.57]On a day-to-day basis, I don't want to eat pizza.
[54:35.89]But during a stream, I sit here.
[54:38.73]I mean, I just think, you know, I just want a full pizza.
[54:41.95]It's only when I'm streaming.
[54:49.46]Me too.
[54:50.44]Do you guys get that too?
[54:55.08]Maybe it's a Twitch thing.
[54:57.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:59.39]S... S-C-K.
[55:24.08]I want to hit those three whirlpools.
[55:25.26]I want to make it harder.
[55:35.32]It's definitely 10.
[55:36.99]Why would it be more than 10?
[55:39.89]I guess it's not that hard to make these games, because once you have the template for them, you can make 10,000 of them.
[55:44.79]Maybe they just never end.
[55:53.75]Comes in a break.
[56:01.21]What if this is randomly generated?
[56:02.27]That would be bad.
[56:10.73]It's the eyes.
[56:15.00]When you get it going sideways, it's good shit.
[56:18.14]It's going sideways.
[56:19.20]Come on, do them all.
[56:24.12]Yeah.
[56:34.32]Wii Sports Party Game?
[56:37.12]Well, let me do No More Heroes first.
[56:38.74]I gotta get my Wii mode to function.
[56:50.71]Only two more levels, and regardless, I'm done.
[56:58.89]This is nice, though.
[57:01.47]Yeah.
[57:03.86]This is the taking a bath of video games.
[57:06.14]Level 9.
[57:08.56]Speed it up.
[57:13.73]That was fast, holy shit.
[57:30.85]Another sorting algorithm?
[57:34.22]I almost have 500,000 points.
[57:35.46]What kind of bath is like this?
[57:44.72]Well, I mean, just the way that my brain is acting right now.
[57:47.18]I'm just relaxing.
[57:48.62]I feel good.
[58:00.37]Get all the beaks.
[58:04.39]You're coming down from the drugs.
[58:05.75]God damn it.
[58:22.08]This better be it.
[58:23.32]This better be it.
[58:27.86]Is it Y2K?
[58:31.57]Is it raining?
[58:35.47]No.
[59:03.42]Maybe in the game.
[59:03.98]Alright, I gotta get back to detective work.
[59:06.80]This is putting me to sleep.
[59:09.50]And I am not going to sleep without a full pizza.
[59:11.24]So, like, that's not gonna happen.
[59:14.78]Get to one million points.
[59:25.71]Damn it.
[59:26.35]Alright, this looks like a final level.
[59:27.99]Look at this.
[59:29.27]This is like original Donkey Kong.
[59:56.18]Yes!
[59:57.86]That's what I wanted.
[59:58.63]That's all I wanted.
[60:34.22]What about the- What about the guy that was murdered?
[60:39.09]Yeah.
[60:40.35]I'll get to it.
[60:41.33]I promise.
[60:44.05]Who?
[60:49.57]What do you mean- Oh.
[60:51.48]Who?
[60:51.72]I think his name- I don't remember his name.
[60:54.24]Jake?
[61:04.42]Alright, fine.
[61:04.90]You guys want me to test for it?
[61:06.36]I will.
[61:10.28]Nevermind, I was too late.
[61:12.02]I was gonna blow into my Wiimote again.
[61:13.04]Oh!
[61:13.10]UGH! UGH! UGH! UGH! UGH! UGH!
[61:19.61]Oh no.

[61:30.11]This is a used Wiimote and I didn't clean it.

[66:41.47]I just like, I just put somebody's like cigarette fingers in my mouth.
[67:04.87]Uh, what level is this?
[67:10.52]We weren't, it wasn't on camera.
[67:11.48]Oh, I'm talking about from like two hours ago.
[67:13.04]Like three hours ago.
[67:18.02]It was, that was a delayed reaction.
[67:19.93]I...
[67:41.56]We did get- we got the cool droopy picture though.
[67:44.06]Yeah, but is that- is that worth getting like- Is that worth getting like cigarette hepatitis?

[68:47.18]Finish the Barnacle game.
[68:55.31]I fucking can't even.
[68:56.55]Alright, this one.
[69:00.09]This is it.
[69:00.32]This is it.
[69:00.68]I don't care.
[69:01.08]This is it.
[69:01.34]I'm gonna stop at 14.
[69:01.98]I don't care.
[69:02.50]No, no, no.
[69:02.84]I'm done.
[69:05.80]Get the fucking goddamn movement out of my mouth.
[69:21.83]Isn't there a murder solve?
[69:23.15]Yes.
[69:24.17]Eventually.
[69:24.81]Maybe I will eventually.
[69:37.34]Once this girl in my 8th grade class licked a pig heart we were dissecting.
[69:41.10]Ugh.
[69:41.18]Wild.
[69:57.91]Yeah, but don't they... Don't they, like, dunk those things in acid to clean them?
[70:04.48]This Wiimote was not dunked in, like, dissecting fluid.
[70:09.54]Somebody scratched their ass, smoked five packs of cigarettes and put it into a box.
[70:33.56]bite into a raw egg to kill the bacteria what would that do I licked I licked the floor of a school bus once
[70:57.52]Why can I see?
[70:58.80]You know, like, images you can hear?
[71:02.33]Why can I hear that story?
[71:05.81]Like a bunch of kids, like, you won't lick the bottom of the school bus!
[71:08.75]Yeah, I will!
[71:10.13]No, you won't!
[71:11.23]Loser!
[71:14.81]Oh, you did it!
[71:15.83]Gross!
[71:17.49]I can hear that image.
[71:21.03]And the bus driver's like, shut the fuck up back there!
[71:28.49]The bus driver's just like, HEY!
[71:31.52]YOU LITTLE BASTARDS!
[71:35.84]DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!
[71:37.94]DON'T DARE YOU LICK MY BUS!
[71:42.08]YOU LITTLE SHITS!
[71:44.30]OH!
[71:44.74]Okay, I gotta pay attention!
[71:55.27]Watch the bus!
[72:14.99]I need to say something, okay?
[72:18.63]Can we give it up a little bit here and give the respect that's deserved to our school bus drivers?
[72:29.80]The amount of shit that they have to listen to and the amount of nonsense that they have to potentially put up with.
[72:37.96]And they've got to pay attention.
[72:39.62]They've got to make sure they get these kids around safely.
[72:44.81]That's a pretty... That requires a little bit of... That requires some applause.
[72:52.63]Because I am... I cannot imagine me ever in any scenario where I would be able to pay attention and drive with this going on.
[73:21.21]Think about it.
[73:26.87]What the fuck is this?
[73:38.10]What a weird gif.
[73:40.42]Okay.
[73:49.95]Alright, so imagine driving a car and needing to pay attention with this going on.
[73:53.43]This is why we need to give our respect to those people.
[74:02.21]You just have to... Okay, I have to get off at the next exit.
[74:24.11]Stop!
[74:27.69]Hey!
[74:31.08]Who?
[74:31.26]Who threw it?
[74:56.81]This is a long video Let's get some more ambience here This is fucking loud
[75:35.60]No, it's just like an airplane.
[75:39.32]That's like an airplane sound.
[75:43.38]Why would that come up as a car driving?
[75:57.35]Okay, I don't know why I saw car sounds sleeping.
[76:02.13]It's a car sounds white noise for sleep.
[76:04.24]I was like, why would a sleep at, what are you talking about?
[76:11.04]No, I can't add all this fucking bullshit.
[76:33.17]Alright, give me a second.
[76:45.26]No, these are cars driving by on the highway.
[76:46.96]That's not gonna work.
[77:01.81]Alright, now this one's fast.
[77:33.13]nope I ain't going there I ain't going there I ain't going there
[78:04.92]No, no, there's a stage where that goes too far, and I don't want to take it there.
[78:22.69]Just go!
[78:23.79]Just go!
[78:24.25]Go!
[78:24.49]Go!
[78:24.71]Just go!
[78:25.15]Do the detective case!
[78:31.27]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[78:34.19]Out, out, out, out.
[78:46.46]Hi, Nancy.
[78:48.10]How can I get into the teacher's lounge?
[78:49.70]Why is it so loud?
[78:52.83]Look, Nancy, maybe this assignment isn't for you.
[78:55.63]I can't be holding your hand all the time.
[78:57.65]Your job is to come to me with solutions, not problems.
[79:01.54]When the police looked through Jake's locker, did they take a videotape?
[79:04.04]When the police looked through Jake's locker, did they take a videotape?
[79:08.24]No.
[79:11.82]We didn't.
[79:12.91]You're thinking there's something important on that tape.
[79:15.23]Important enough that Jake hid it.
[79:17.31]Something like that.
[79:18.85]Good lead.
[79:20.19]Find that videotape, Nancy.
[79:23.56]Goodbye.
[79:24.72]Be careful.
[79:25.50]Okay, so I need to find the videotape.
[79:37.63]I would appreciate if we got rid of the Mario Kart intro music.
[79:53.40]Is there anything else in the house?
[79:55.28]What the hell else am I supposed to do besides drink soda?
[80:10.59]What the hell else do high school kids do besides walk around and drink soda?
[80:18.54]Hey Nancy, need something?
[80:21.29]Do you know why Jake had an empty videocassette case in his locker?
[80:25.29]No.
[80:25.91]Why are you so interested in Jake anyway?
[80:28.49]I gotta go now.
[80:29.47]Later.
[80:30.99]Nancy, I'm starting to wonder about you.
[80:33.55]Didn't I hear you were dating Jake?
[80:36.66]Hey, a girl can make a mistake, can't she?
[80:40.02]Do you know Hal Tanaka?
[80:41.90]Not very well.
[80:43.40]He's an exchange student from Japan and a total workaholic.
[80:47.38]He told me he's trying to get more scholarships for college.
[80:50.53]Okay.
[80:50.73]Uh... What's the play here?
[80:51.61]What do I have a key?
[80:52.87]What's this key for?
[80:53.47]I got it?
[80:53.83]Wait.
[80:54.07]Okay.
[80:55.29]What's the key for?
[80:56.85]Have I found a key yet?
[81:21.09]Have I found a place for this to go?
[81:25.13]Is it the maintenance closet?
[81:27.41]No.
[81:27.97]This might be a puzzle.
[81:39.13]What would it want me to do?
[81:42.49]Go to the library?
[81:45.11]What the hell is the library?
[81:49.79]I mean, that's the exit.
[81:54.18]Other way?
[81:56.32]Down here?
[81:57.30]Library.
[81:59.94]Library.
[82:02.52]Library?
[82:07.77]This library sucks.
[82:11.91]Do you know why Jake had an empty video cassette case in his...
[82:18.38]Yeah, I see it.
[82:18.98]I see it.
[82:19.54]I see it and it's beautiful.
[82:20.98]It's very nice.
[82:21.74]It's very, very nice.
[82:23.04]I didn't know Jake was interested in video.
[82:25.38]I avoided him whenever I could.
[82:27.64]Jesus Christ!
[82:35.55]I avoided him whenever I could.
[82:37.55]I hated him.
[82:38.03]He was an asshole.
[82:38.89]He was a piece of shit.
[82:40.09]Nobody liked him.
[82:41.03]I don't like him.
[82:41.69]He sucked.
[82:43.49]Connie told me you study too hard.
[82:45.48]Is that true?
[82:46.75]Connie doesn't know my study habits.
[82:48.65]I can handle my studies.
[82:50.51]I'm behind in my studies and I must get back to the library.
[82:53.46]Bye, Nancy.
[82:59.16]Are you in the library?
[83:01.36]You're in the library.
[83:02.32]That's where you are.
[83:18.72]Oh, no.
[83:19.06]Here's a library.
[83:23.20]Who locks a school library?
[83:27.44]Is there forbidden knowledge in here?
[83:28.80]I don't understand.
[83:29.82]Monday through 3 to 8 to 4.
[83:31.12]I can't go in there.
[83:33.03]Yeah, I can.
[83:33.69]Give me that key.
[83:47.62]Fiction.
[84:00.13]Secret books, no?
[84:11.18]What is a relic?
[84:16.04]What's a relic?
[84:17.04]I don't know.
[84:18.06]A perfect alibi.
[84:20.90]Whatever.
[84:21.24]Doesn't seem to be very interesting.
[84:29.40]What even is a relic?
[84:35.19]It's weird.
[84:35.61]I know exactly what a relic is, but it's hard for me to describe to you what a relic is.
[84:39.95]It's an old piece of an old medallion or an old crafted thing that is old and from an old culture, an old...
[84:55.21]An old religion.
[84:56.57]It's a object that holds significant potential cultural value, right?
[85:10.24]Wrong.
[85:12.06]Alright, where's my, um... Didn't I read somebody's password?
[85:19.26]Catalog search.
[85:20.04]What am I looking for?
[85:20.60]What was the name?
[85:30.42]I've been checked out.
[85:43.62]What was the relic?
[85:49.06]Check shelf.
[85:57.66]Star Wars, it's not gonna be Star Wars book.
[85:59.54]This will be something I'm specifically looking for.
[86:01.14]I Don't know what it is though What was some of the other names of those There was this I think there was a book I there was something written down Somebody has a book somewhere Why the music just changed
[86:32.22]the fuck is going on more of this do I have to look these up there's got to be something to be about what's this one called the meltdown digital meltdown a novel by jeremy albertson what's this one called
[87:01.19]The Crystal Skulls?
[87:13.46]Jake was here.
[87:16.14]Things to remember, the answer to my fate lies in the box.
[87:21.12]A matchbook behind Maxine's schedule holds the first step.
[87:25.80]My messages hold the remaining 18 steps.
[87:30.82]The elements tell the order.
[87:33.02]The letter and digit tell the direction.
[87:36.96]JR.
[87:40.42]Oh my god, man.
[87:42.21]U2.
[87:44.85]Where's U2?
[88:02.54]What element is U2?
[88:11.07]No, we gotta go to the schedule.
[88:13.19]Underneath the schedule... An incomplete table.
[88:20.09]Matchbook behind Maxine's schedule.
[88:23.53]Well, let's go look at that.
[88:32.18]Take a screenshot of this.
[88:34.22]Yeah.
[88:35.07]Good idea.
[88:47.44]Good call.
[88:52.92]I hate when it goes to this music.
[88:54.59]It always goes back to this.
[89:02.71]Alright.
[89:04.65]Who's... We gotta find Mac... Who is it?
[89:07.19]Maxine?
[89:07.80]I thought they were gonna make me do another one of those.
[89:14.50]Oh no, they might.
[89:22.29]No.
[89:22.99]Thank god.
[89:23.41]Alright, behind the schedule...
[89:34.24]Who the hell is that?
[89:35.48]Okay, see you later.
[89:53.79]Wait, this is a Kevin MacLeod song?
[89:58.03]Really?
[90:14.24]Let's go talk to Mr. Jim.
[90:17.07]How's it going?
[90:19.95]Who's Maxine?
[90:21.51]Tell me about the robbery at the drug station pharmacy.
[90:25.03]Why would I know about a robbery?
[90:27.01]All I know about is football.
[90:31.69]Okay.
[90:32.51]I'm really sorry you got injured.
[90:34.51]Does that affect your chances of playing college ball?
[90:38.03]I had a little sprain, no big deal.
[90:40.23]Within a week, I was better than before, and impressing the football scouts.
[90:44.83]I'm as strong as ever.
[90:49.73]Anyone that says I'm as strong as ever usually is about at 40%.
[90:51.57]What can you tell me about Connie Watson?
[90:53.97]She hangs out at the gym a lot.
[90:55.85]I heard she's been having a real tough time.
[91:00.22]Why do you think she hangs out at the gym so much?
[91:03.26]I don't know.
[91:04.26]She's a pretty good athlete, but never joined any of Paseo Del Mar's teams.
[91:08.66]Why not?
[91:09.12]Why not?
[91:09.68]Hmm, not exactly sure.
[91:13.54]You said she was having a tough time.
[91:15.56]I heard she's been having some money problems.
[91:19.05]Did you take the video cassette from Jake's locker?
[91:20.63]Do you know why Jake had an empty video cassette case in his locker?
[91:23.57]I didn't pay much attention to Jake.
[91:25.73]I'm tired of talking about that loser.
[91:27.61]I'll kill you with my bare teeth.
[91:30.11]Do you know Hal Tanaka?
[91:31.91]That dude is always studying.
[91:33.77]He's a huge fan of mine.
[91:34.93]Real smart guy.
[91:36.29]But I never understood why a brain like Tanaka would hang out with slime like Jake.
[91:40.88]What the fuck?
[91:41.94]Hal was a friend of Jake's?
[91:44.22]Let's just say I saw them talking together a lot.
[91:46.92]Jake's locker was right next to Hal's.
[91:49.58]But they weren't really friends.
[91:50.98]Is that what you're saying?
[91:52.66]Jake didn't really have friends, and Hal?
[91:55.40]He may seem pretty chill, but I've seen him crack a couple of times.
[91:58.81]He's seriously uptight.
[91:59.91]What do you mean, crack?
[92:01.43]Crack a couple of times.
[92:03.45]He's got a temper, a bad one.
[92:05.29]He lets the pressure build and build until he's wound so tight the slightest thing sets him off.
[92:09.63]Like last week, I strike him out during gym, and he goes ballistic and charges the mound.
[92:14.46]He's got some serious issues.
[92:16.76]Now that I think of it, last time I saw them together, Hal seemed pretty upset.
[92:21.28]Sure.
[92:23.28]Well, we have new info to bring to, uh... I'm not into pushy girls.
[92:29.43]Do me a favor and bother someone else.
[92:32.37]I'll talk to you later.
[92:34.57]I'm gonna drink a Mountain Dew just because of that.
[92:37.97]Dick.
[92:44.34]Oh, just regular soda water.
[92:45.90]Gross.
[92:46.18]Okay.
[92:54.44]Now, who would ever buy that?
[93:00.69]Cat puke.
[93:03.63]Alright, let's go talk and say, hey, uh, so you, uh, you, uh, attacked people.
[93:08.49]Alright, where's this thing I have to get?
[93:14.03]I need a schedule.
[93:20.15]Have you seen any of those weird messages on the bulletin boards?
[93:25.44]Yes, and if I catch the guy who's doing it, he's going to be in big trouble.
[93:29.46]I bet it's the same person who keeps on setting off the soda machine alarm.
[93:35.57]There's a soda machine alarm?
[93:37.67]I guess that comes with the territory of being a school monitor.
[93:41.25]Normally it's not this hectic.
[93:42.96]When I figure out who's been pulling all these pranks,
[93:46.71]Hulk told me money's been tight for you these days.
[93:49.83]What a dork.
[93:51.13]Hulk Sanchez doesn't know the first thing about my life.
[93:53.96]He needs to get a life and stop talking about mine.
[93:56.24]I need to sit the four of these people in this room in each one of these chairs and go fucking hash it out and walk away.
[94:02.25]Seriously.
[94:02.77]See you later.
[94:03.31]Adios.
[94:21.48]The soda can't just be for fun, can it?
[94:30.89]Looking for the schedule.
[94:33.47]Somebody had a schedule we need to look behind.
[94:35.71]Maybe on a bulletin board?
[94:36.79]Wait a minute.
[94:41.05]What's that?
[94:45.95]Uh, okay.
[94:46.11]Well, there's the U2.
[94:47.01]Yeah, why are there only three people in this school?
[95:16.38]It's gonna be real easy to narrow down who killed Jake, considering there's only four people in the game.
[95:28.51]There's a 25% chance to get it right.
[95:37.66]Announcements.
[95:40.56]Student bulletin board.
[95:41.64]Attention.
[95:42.20]Wait.
[95:44.87]I feel like this shit is important somehow.
[96:20.87]Something about the elements?
[96:25.15]I have no idea.
[96:25.95]Why would I need to be... Why can't I look at this?
[96:34.04]Take a picture of it?
[96:38.16]Is there anyone else I can go in town?
[96:39.44]I feel like I'm just trapped here.
[96:44.50]What can I do for you?
[96:47.13]Do you know why Jake had an empty videocassette case in his locker?
[96:51.13]Why were you in Jake's locker?
[96:56.29]It was open and I just looked through it.
[96:58.64]Best excuse.
[96:59.32]Uh oh, he sees through my disguise.
[97:04.94]What else can I do for you?
[97:05.98]He knows, he knows.
[97:10.27]Didn't I hear that you found Jake's body?
[97:13.04]yeah I did the student council president gets keys to the school we had an early morning council meeting and I found him lying there it was the worst thing I ever experienced in my life and I really don't want to think about it right now do you know connie watson arrest him for what not that well she keeps to herself a lot
[97:38.93]I've always thought there's something mysterious about her.
[97:42.73]Kind of the same way I feel about you.
[97:44.75]Is that a $1.30 for a ham sandwich?
[97:46.53]That's pretty cool.
[97:50.45]How well do you know Hulk Sanchez?
[97:52.91]Big guy, big muscles, big dreams.
[97:56.25]A lot of football scouts have been coming over to watch him play.
[97:59.21]He must be under a lot of pressure to perform.
[98:01.76]What can you tell me about Hal Tanaka?
[98:04.75]Hal's an exchange student who's all scholarships and study.
[98:07.77]He's very intense about becoming a doctor.
[98:10.47]How much ketchup can you drink in 10 seconds?
[98:12.85]Talk to you later.
[98:14.47]Impress me.
[98:14.95]See ya.
[98:22.73]Can I go in the back?
[98:25.41]I didn't even know I could go back here.
[98:32.33]That's just very realistic.
[98:34.71]That's a pretty realistic looking knife.
[98:39.12]Cooking mini-game, I hope so.
[98:42.28]Payday, payday, payday, payday.
[98:44.18]Didn't I find that in his locker?
[98:45.95]It wasn't in the corner?
[99:03.38]First aid?
[99:03.98]No.
[99:10.56]He's on the schedule, yeah.
[99:14.16]Hold on, let me see that again.
[99:16.64]Alright, behind, right, behind the schedule, right?
[99:21.88]Didn't it say the clue was behind Maxine's schedule?
[99:27.83]T-E-L-3, where is it?
[99:31.11]T-E-L-3.
[99:37.19]Siki Ichi Hikaru, what is that?
[99:43.59]What does that mean, though?
[99:50.00]He's not looking at those edits?
[99:51.24]I'll look at one.
[99:54.60]Pretty good.
[99:57.24]Pretty good.
[100:02.20]What am I supposed to do with this?
[100:19.50]So I have it.
[100:20.22]Now what?
[100:29.11]Yeah, that's good.
[100:29.69]No, fuck off, says Jerma985.
[100:31.77]When did I do that?
[100:41.83]What does this mean?
[100:46.79]Is that numbers?
[100:49.21]Typed like C-E-E?
[100:50.79]Or... I don't know.
[100:56.42]I don't get it.
[100:59.84]That's Braille, right?
[101:00.96]But... What do I need that for?
[101:06.34]What about periodic table?
[101:10.00]See ya!
[101:10.92]Farewell, Nancy.
[101:13.59]Eric from high school, remember me?
[101:15.01]Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in English class.
[101:16.91]Sorry, you're just an easy target.
[101:17.97]Uh, I cannot see much to change.
[101:20.75]Remember, uh, Jenny, the girl you had a crush on when we were married.
[101:23.63]I now make over $200,000 a year.
[101:25.57]Uh, and I drive a really expensive car.
[101:28.19]I guess some things never change.
[101:29.23]I'm a loser and that's catching up.
[101:30.43]LOL, pathetic.
[101:31.51]I made more money than you.
[101:35.71]In the last, like, 14 days.
[101:39.19]So, um, cool.
[101:42.85]Good luck.
[101:49.60]Not even true.
[101:50.28]I can't, I can't perpetuate that one.
[101:56.48]That means, that means I make like fucking $70 million a year.
[102:04.95]I need to go to the pier.
[102:05.77]All right.
[102:06.21]I'm about to turn it off.
[102:09.17]I need to get, I'm going to go.
[102:09.93]I'm, I'm, I'm, my pizza levels are at a dangerous level.
[102:22.37]What was that?
[102:26.91]Wait.
[102:37.73]How do I flip it?
[102:44.12]I can't flip it?
[102:52.14]Flip your head.
[102:59.32]This isn't... Nowhere to turn to.
[103:02.84]Nowhere to hide.
[103:04.68]Let the books in the library be your answer guide.
[103:08.25]Okay.
[103:12.03]It... This is mirrored.
[103:19.51]That... Hold on.
[103:20.47]It's mirrored.
[103:37.66]Okay, got a picture.
[103:38.48]Now, can you flip horizontally in iPhone?
[103:48.27]You can't.
[103:50.49]Just mirror OBS.
[103:52.80]Oh, right, I can just mirror OBS.
[104:09.45]Uh, nowhere to turn to, nowhere to hide.
[104:11.69]No... Wait, what?
[104:20.35]Transform.
[104:21.69]Flip horizontal.
[104:25.75]That... What is going on?
[104:33.73]That someone... That someone must...
[104:38.46]Why is this wrong?
[104:43.89]The letters... It's the placement of the letters.
[104:47.21]It's... That someone must hide reflects big secret.
[105:03.32]War...
[105:06.36]Worn with great pride, a symbol of jank.
[105:17.05]A symbol of... Kanji.
[105:30.98]Wait, the thing around her neck?
[105:35.42]Dude, that medallion, right?
[105:37.02]That was his last one.
[105:41.06]Took it to Bibb.
[105:46.82]I have to go eat a pizza.
[105:49.20]Took it... Took it to Bibb.
[105:59.59]I had to... It's upside down, though.
[106:01.31]Hold on, flip it upside down.
[106:05.79]Yeah, it's not a good pizza.
[106:06.57]Let me look at it here.
[106:12.46]He did what it took to make the grade, even if it meant cheating to keep up his charade.
[106:16.67]Talking about me?
[106:29.88]Alright, so we gotta talk- we gotta talk to, um, that- the lady in here.
[106:34.08]I'm gonna sneeze.
[106:34.52]I can- I can do about it.
[106:36.86]Alright, let's go talk about the necklace.
[106:48.13]It's almost time for me to get a pizza.
[106:49.47]Close.
[106:57.67]Where was she sitting again?
[107:05.74]I don't even remember.
[107:06.36]Okay.
[107:08.64]Hey, Nancy, I'm starting to wonder about you.
[107:11.44]I'll talk to you later.
[107:12.82]Bye, Nancy.
[107:16.52]What is this?
[107:30.85]What does it say?
[107:38.78]Nancy, I'm starting to wonder about you.
[107:40.22]Okay, it looks like... I need to get... I want to see.
[107:45.10]I'm trying to get a picture of the medallion.
[107:46.90]Oh, my God.
[107:48.44]I'll talk to you later.
[107:49.84]Bye, Nancy.
[107:57.66]What does this mean, too?
[108:04.66]Nancy, you can't go in there.
[108:06.24]How do I get rid of you so I can go in here?
[108:09.78]You're eating pizza right now?
[108:11.08]Damn it.
[108:15.13]I've never been more jealous in my whole life.
[108:19.05]What kind of pizza is it, though?
[108:21.46]Talk to me.
[108:24.96]Best pizza on Earth?
[108:27.96]is very very thin crispy thin crust not talking paper thin pepperoni pizza that's it don't put any of the junk on it just a super thin crispy pepperoni pizza I don't want anything else on it
[108:49.03]Don't load it up with hamburger meat and onions and garlic and bacon and salami and... Because then it's not a pizza anymore.
[108:58.01]You just... You're eating, like, spaghetti and meatballs at that point.
[109:05.02]You might as well just put it all in a bowl and eat it out of a bowl.
[109:13.40]Because the ship just falls apart.
[109:15.75]If you get a meat lover's pizza, don't eat meat lover's pizza, seriously.
[109:18.96]Like, it's just... They're just making a joke.
[109:23.74]Because you pick it up and you lift it up and it goes... Here, I'll give you an example.
[109:28.46]So you pick up a piece of pizza that's Meat Lovers, right?
[109:31.68]I just picked it up.
[109:32.34]This is the top, this is the crust.
[109:33.84]So I pick it up and it goes like this.
[109:35.64]And everything just falls off into the plate.
[109:38.34]And then you go, oh shit, oh well.
[109:40.04]Looks like I'm eating a piece of wet paper with spaghetti sauce on it.
[109:46.13]What's that down there?
[109:47.17]All the shit that I paid for?
[109:48.85]I'll eat it with a fork later.
[110:01.25]You have to fold it.
[110:05.06]Oh, sure.
[110:05.56]Let me go ahead and let me fold the pizza now.
[110:08.36]Let's fold it in half.
[110:09.68]And then when I bite into it, like this, all the toppings mush out into my face and go all over me and burn the fuck out of me.
[110:19.71]Like, ow!
[110:20.59]And it falls down on the plate and there it goes again.
[110:24.11]If you, no, don't say we.
[110:26.07]That's why I didn't do it because I touched it.
[110:29.45]If you fold a pizza that has a ton of toppings on it, all the toppings just mush out of the top.
[110:42.58]He's never eaten pizza.
[110:43.68]Do I have to order a Meat Lovers pizza and eat it?
[110:46.94]To show you that... Where are you getting your Meat Lovers pizzas?
[110:50.56]They're loaded with toppings.
[110:59.08]You're a crackhead.
[111:03.24]You don't eat tacos.
[111:04.60]Tacos are messy too, but they're good.
[111:06.16]No, I'm not doing it on stream right now.
[111:08.38]Alright, fine.
[111:08.80]How about this?
[111:09.40]I promise.
[111:09.92]Listen, listen, listen.
[111:10.74]Time stamp this.
[111:12.28]I will eat a big meat lover's pizza.
[111:16.71]Not the whole thing, but just enough for me to prove that they're a fucking mess.
[111:23.21]Not tomorrow.
[111:23.73]We're doing No More Heroes tomorrow.
[111:25.98]It'll be its own stream.
[111:27.44]The stream will just be titled, Dickhead Eats a Pizza to Prove a Non-Existent Point.
[111:32.32]Alright, see you tomorrow.
[111:46.32]I'm out.
[111:47.78]I'm going to get a pizza.
[111:49.38]I'm going to get a pizza.
[111:50.18]Now we talked about it.
[111:50.98]Now I want one.
[112:01.69]boo boo boo five hour stream because hungry boomer no five hour stream because I couldn't get uh no more heroes to work I still have I thought this is a good one I had a lot of fun playing nancy drew maybe not this one but the last one and this one too at least first yeah I liked it but we we keep talking but you guys messed it up you talked about pizza too many times the second you bring up pizza I'm gonna leave you know that right
[112:31.36]If you guys want more than, you know, six, seven hour streams, don't say the word pizza in the chat.
[112:39.02]How many times have I looked over here when someone's like, oh man, I really want a pizza tonight.
[112:42.60]And I go, oh cool, me too.
[112:44.00]And the stream ends in like 40 minutes.
[112:48.73]That's happened at least three or four times in the last six months.
[112:55.57]It's our fault.
[112:57.83]What topping should I get?
[112:59.33]I told you.
[113:00.92]Pepperoni.
[113:03.48]Cheese with the nice tangy sauce.
[113:06.51]Crispy.
[113:07.09]It's gotta be crispy.
[113:09.07]It's gotta be crispy.
[113:10.69]None of this folded.
[113:12.65]No, no, no.
[113:13.19]I want when I bite into it to sound like a fucking goddamn potato chip cartoon commercial.
[113:26.56]I want to bite into that crust and have it be like this.
[113:30.72]I don't like doughy ass pizza.
[113:40.91]I want it to be like this.
[113:54.32]Maybe, okay, maybe not, that sounds like someone's chewing on sand.
[113:56.86]Maybe not that crunchy.
[114:05.90]Dude, people, ah, here's another thing that's weird.
[114:09.46]It is 50-50 split whether or not people want to instantly throw up when they, like, somebody crunching on something is instant, instantaneous.
[114:22.88]just vile reaction.
[114:25.52]And then there are other people that go, oh, do that again.
[114:27.50]I remember I was eating chocolate one time on stream.
[114:34.23]This is like three, I don't know why I remember this.
[114:35.57]This is like three years ago.
[114:37.35]And I was eating like Reese's chocolate or something.
[114:41.69]And there was like at least a bunch of people, there was a bunch of people that were saying, dude, you're fucking disgusting.
[114:46.92]Like stop, I don't want to hear that.
[114:48.82]And I had to mute a bunch of times.
[115:00.67]Was it a dream?
[115:01.39]No, it wasn't.
[115:11.43]Dude, I was.
[115:12.53]I swear to God.
[115:24.63]View your mic while you eat.
[115:26.83]Nah, nah, nah, nah.
[115:28.16]I'm gonna put the can on this one tonight.
[115:29.60]We're gonna start No More Heroes tomorrow.
[115:35.40]The viewers are dying.
[115:36.70]Well, I did just say the stream was over.
[115:40.95]No More Heroes starts tomorrow.
[115:42.21]We're going four days in a row, by the way.
[115:44.71]Did I mention that?
[115:45.27]I don't think I did.
[115:49.16]The reason why I didn't stream the last three or four days in a row is because I was getting the New Year's Eve stuff ready, and that stuff is almost all ready.
[115:56.49]So we can just go four days in a row.
[115:58.45]You'll have no more heroes tomorrow, maybe no more heroes again, depending on if I do that on Monday.
[116:03.05]And then New Year's Eve stream on the 31st.
[116:11.72]More Nancy.
[116:12.86]I don't think there'll be time for it tomorrow or the next day.
[116:17.20]Maybe I'll get a pizza on New Year's.
[116:18.36]That's not a bad idea.
[116:19.58]What a good idea.
[116:21.32]Alright, fine.
[116:21.86]I'll get a pizza and I'm gonna eat it on stream.
[116:25.08]I'm gonna get burnt.
[116:25.78]I already know it.
[116:26.34]Alright, I'm gonna be careful on that one.
[116:28.32]Alright, guys.
[116:28.88]I'll see you tomorrow.
[116:29.94]Thanks for sticking around.
[116:30.71]We're gonna go over the subs and bits and everything, so don't worry.
[116:35.89]Stick around if you want.
[116:42.78]Sort of an impromptu Nancy Drew stream because last second I couldn't get my Wiimote to work, but it's kind of what I plan on doing tomorrow.
[116:50.86]Is making sure I can get it to function.
[116:54.55]If I can't, then we're just going to have to boot up the old Wii.
[117:00.39]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[117:03.97]Have a great night.
[117:04.55]Those of you sticking around...
[117:13.12]Let's talk about bits.
[117:17.38]Shall we?
[117:20.14]Melatonin Dream Boy, thanks for the 500 bits.
[117:24.67]No message, just 500 bits.
[117:25.67]Thank you.
[117:28.33]Uh, thank you, Heavymin, for the 300 bits.
[117:29.99]No More Heroes is one of my favorite franchises.
[117:32.77]And I'd be sure happy to see you play it.
[117:35.43]I'd recommend playing the Wii versions on the original hardware since they can be both bought for like 10 bucks.
[117:40.74]Uh, never experienced emulating it, though.
[117:42.48]Also, difficulty is really not that bad on normal mode, and the controls are easier to control on the Wii mode than you think.
[117:46.58]You can also use the Wii Classic controller if you don't want to deal with the motion controls.
[117:51.07]I played No More Heroes 1 and 2 a long time ago.
[117:55.61]I love these games.
[117:57.25]They're a little janky and a little wonky.
[117:59.53]But I wanted to do them both.
[118:07.31]But I didn't want to split it up to do PS3 because it's a better version and runs better.
[118:12.54]And then go to Wii and it runs like crap.
[118:15.12]I'd rather them just both be streamed through the PC.
[118:25.35]Because I can make the resolution better, I can make it look a lot better.
[118:27.99]Because the Weaver, I know we were memeing on the original version, but it really does run like crap in a lot of places from what I remember.
[118:40.96]If you hit somebody with your blade and the blood blows up out of their head, I remember it specifically chugging down to like 10 frames a second half the time.
[118:50.23]So...
[118:52.00]I'd like to run it in its best way to present it to people.
[118:56.36]The PS3 runs worse like crap, really.
[118:58.84]Well, then they both do.
[119:00.08]So then, even better reason to not stream it on original hardware.
[119:05.88]Because I did walk around in it very, very briefly.
[119:10.17]And it seems to run pretty well on the settings I have now on PC.
[119:14.77]Through emulation.
[119:17.53]Riding the bike through town will be rough.
[119:19.09]Yeah, it always is, though.
[119:23.89]But yeah, it's um, it should be a great experience.
[119:26.89]It's a really fun game.
[119:27.67]It's a really interesting game I'm looking forward to to return to it again Heavy min that was you Thank you again for 300 bits, I don't know why it does this sometimes like I lose money there it is Thank you hate
[119:48.39]Sucks.
[119:49.81]Hate sucks.
[119:51.25]No, it was me.
[119:51.91]It was not you.
[119:53.63]Uh, thanks for the thousand bits hate.
[119:54.93]They say Drew Crew.
[119:55.85]That's right.
[119:57.09]It was the last minute Drew Crew.
[120:01.66]Thank you so much for the $10,000 bits from hate.
[120:06.93]Dark Souls, thanks for the 250 bits.
[120:08.69]Do you think one day we'll get a lifting stream where you do a workout set?
[120:13.35]Like getting slimed for doing something chat predicts.
[120:15.53]Assuming the doctors can put your Humpty Dumpty streamer back together well enough.
[120:22.18]Probably not for a while.
[120:23.46]I have to get... Okay, if 2020 is the year for me, is when I'm going to be doing physical therapy, I have to figure out what's going on with my body.
[120:36.17]2020 is the get healthy year.
[120:39.19]It's not like I've been living an unhealthy lifestyle or anything.
[120:41.63]It's just for some reason, a lot of things have compounded on top of each other the last year.
[120:47.03]So I'm going to do everything necessary to get 100% healthy again.
[120:52.30]And whatever that means, whatever procedures or treatments or therapy that I have to do for my rib cage or whatever the fuck is wrong with me and my hernia, I might just have surgery.
[121:03.81]I might just go do it.
[121:06.55]Like, a hiatal hernia doesn't go away.
[121:10.59]It gets worse until you get surgery.
[121:13.35]So, I might just go do it, just get it over with.
[121:18.57]The surgery is a simple procedure.
[121:21.19]You're fine in like four days or something.
[121:24.82]Because I feel like there's a bunch of issues that are kind of stacking on top of each other.
[121:29.80]But we'll find out.
[121:30.60]I have a couple of appointments coming up.
[121:33.96]And then we'll talk about maybe doing some more of that stuff.
[121:38.94]Maybe.
[121:39.77]We'll see.
[121:41.81]But appreciate the 250.
[121:42.47]Fitty, thanks for the 500 bits, Fitty.
[121:47.41]Hey, German, this site shows your net worth.
[121:49.47]Can you give me some investment advice?
[121:53.41]You seem to be quite successful.
[121:54.95]Worth of the web.
[121:55.95]What the fuck is this?
[122:01.50]How much is... How much is YouTube.com slash user slash Jerma985 worth?
[122:07.74]You can find the estimated website value for Jerma985 in US dollars.
[122:12.25]What is it?
[122:15.33]Oh.
[122:15.43]102 billion dollars.
[122:16.69]102 billion 650 million dollars.
[122:35.82]wow that's pretty good how much is amazon.com worth amazon.com okay amazon.com is worth 4.8 billion dollars cool that's that's cool with me I'm okay being worth uh like 50 amazons
[123:13.58]Buy Amazon now.
[123:19.32]Dude, that guy from English class.
[123:20.82]Yeah, that guy from English class ain't got nothing on me.
[123:22.98]Did you see that website?
[123:31.80]Yeah, man.
[123:32.35]I got 200k.
[123:33.95]I got this awesome life.
[123:36.87]What about you?
[123:37.49]Hey, I'm worth 102 billion dollars.
[123:42.29]Mr. English Class.
[123:49.54]That's wild, though.
[123:50.32]I don't even know... How is it even calculating that?
[123:53.72]LittleWolfie, thanks for the 850.
[123:55.10]Cheating bits.
[123:56.21]850 bits from LittleWolfie.
[123:58.89]Is that bits because I cheated or bits for me to not cheat?
[124:02.15]I wonder.
[124:10.75]Jerma.org is only worth $150.
[124:12.87]It was a bit bounty.
[124:24.80]Thank you.
[124:28.92]Thank you, Lula.
[124:30.54]Lula Moore for the thousand bits, 10 bucks.
[124:33.60]Hey Jerma, I've been a longtime sub and fan.
[124:35.74]I was watching YouTube with my son the other day, and without being prompted, he asked to watch some of your videos.
[124:41.86]He said, Jerma is amazing.
[124:43.10]He's so hilarious.
[124:43.96]I wish I could be that funny someday.
[124:46.36]I just thought it was cute and a testament to your content that me, a 34-year-old mom boomer, and my kid both think you're hilarious.
[124:54.83]P.S.
[124:55.67]He peed his pants from laughing.
[124:57.03]It was gross.
[124:58.13]Love the stream and content.
[125:01.67]Happy New Year.
[125:02.21]Happy New Year to you as well.
[125:08.83]He's so hilarious.
[125:12.73]I gotta stop swearing.
[125:14.55]I gotta stop swearing.
[125:15.53]Think of the children, you know what I mean?
[125:18.14]And I gotta stop pretending to stand up over my desk and pee into a cup.
[125:21.74]You know, I just have to figure that out too.
[125:23.48]I gotta clean my act up a little bit.
[125:34.43]That will literally never happen.
[125:35.92]If you think I'm smart enough to be able to put a filter on some of the things that I say, you're sadly mistaken.
[125:41.94]I tried it.
[125:43.28]I tried it for like a year or two.
[125:45.96]Didn't work.
[125:49.32]Dude, he's got no filter.
[125:51.77]I say what I want.
[125:52.89]No filter.
[125:55.83]That's when like every single person in the audience, their eyes just rolled in the back of their head all the way to the back.
[126:06.14]But no, thank you, Lula.
[126:07.24]I appreciate it.
[126:09.32]I'm also a 34-year-old boomer, so... He's unhinged.
[126:18.79]Thank you.
[126:19.91]DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[126:21.21]Checking in from Gap Gaming again.
[126:23.32]Really great job with testing our anti-ad gimmick last time.
[126:27.58]It really got your chat going.
[126:29.42]Any Gappers?
[126:31.14]That said, it is concerning to us that you can't seem to beat a game made for three-year-olds.
[126:35.79]We'll have to dock some points for that in your upcoming review.
[126:39.93]Hope you get better, you dumb idiot streamer.
[126:42.99]Thank you, Gap.
[126:44.72]Appreciate it.
[126:49.19]No, it's DarkSoul.
[126:50.59]That's DarkSoul9669.
[126:53.27]Your name's not Gap.
[126:57.76]Mac's a disaster thanks to the 500 bits.
[127:02.14]I just want to thank you for streaming today.
[127:03.56]My mother was just diagnosed with multiple myeloma.
[127:08.05]Myeloma?
[127:09.27]It's a blood plasma cancer that affects bones.
[127:12.29]So I'm glad I have your LUL moments to take my mind off things.
[127:16.68]Here's five bucks to show my appreciation for your Twitch funny man endeavors.
[127:20.50]Thanks.
[127:22.78]I'm really, really sorry to hear that.
[127:28.40]I don't know.
[127:28.84]I'm not sure what stage or how far along that is.
[127:35.74]But hopefully it's very treatable.
[127:43.17]You do what you can, right?
[127:45.37]Thank you so much.
[127:46.71]I wish the absolute best for your mother.
[127:57.92]Glad to have you.
[128:03.76]Cancer sucks.
[128:07.48]If I could seriously just go like this and get rid of it, oh, I would do it a hundred times.
[128:11.73]Everybody would.
[128:13.07]Just one of those stupid fucking illnesses that we still can't seem to figure out, you know?
[128:21.37]But a lot of it is treatable.
[128:30.27]All the best to you and your mother.
[128:36.24]Thank you for the $5.
[128:42.92]Shitty viewbot thanks for the 500 bits.
[128:44.84]Not like this, not like this, not like this.
[128:46.67]Drugs are bad.
[128:47.63]Was that when I was pretending that I was on drugs?
[128:55.68]Oh, I mean, we can talk about this very briefly now if you want.
[129:00.03]I haven't talked about it really that much at all.
[129:03.49]But one of the reasons why the Rumble has not been done yet is because the next Rumble is going to be a charity event.
[129:17.59]And all the money that that stream takes in, whether it's bits or subs, whatever money that that stream takes in that day is going to go and sponsor a good friend of mine's Boston Marathon run.
[129:32.51]And all that money is going to go to a, I believe, a pediatric cancer ward in Boston.
[129:40.05]So we're trying to figure out some maybe some fun things to do.
[129:49.69]But that's part of the plan.
[129:59.24]Have him run in glue man attire.
[130:02.10]We've been talking about ideas of... Essentially, we're going to have him be a character in the Rumble.
[130:08.94]And whatever he has in clothes, we're going to have him run in those clothes.
[130:12.98]And I'm going to have him take some video.
[130:16.13]This should be fun.
[130:20.60]He's gonna be a new original character.
[130:26.76]He's just like, yeah, I'll do, I'll do, that'll be fun.
[130:29.12]I just want to make sure I can actually run in whatever it is.
[130:31.82]And it's like, don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[130:41.53]And the way that it's set up, it actually should be pretty easy, because...
[130:46.55]there is specific there's gonna be a specific website that is linked directly to the charity so the money I I can from everything that comes in that stream I can just put it directly in uh to that website so it's not like oh I'm gonna just make all this money on twitch and then then like I'll figure it out later no it'll be there'll be plenty of avenues to get that figured out it'll be live action it will not
[131:18.18]That's the plan.
[131:21.17]Because the marathon is in April.
[131:23.11]So, I want to do it a little bit before that, obviously, to make sure, because it's essentially sponsor is run.
[131:30.99]Or at least to contribute what I and this community can, right?
[131:37.54]We'll see.
[131:42.74]But thank you to Jim Poe for the 300 bits.
[131:48.75]Somewhere in January.
[131:51.36]When it's ready.
[131:53.56]It will be absolutely before March.
[131:56.82]Let's just put it that way.
[132:07.09]Before March.
[132:09.55]Yeah.
[132:09.97]But thank you, Jim.
[132:10.83]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[132:11.81]No message.
[132:12.23]Here's your rebuttal here.
[132:13.91]I played Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro when they launched.
[132:35.64]I played Sekiro the day it came out.
[132:37.25]There's no guide.
[132:38.57]What guide existed on day zero?
[132:41.07]I played it when it came out.
[132:46.23]One day had gone by and nobody even had beaten the game.
[132:56.21]You don't have any witnesses.
[133:00.06]Guides came out pre-release.
[133:01.54]You think I was flipping through...
[133:04.37]The shit that they sell at GameStop?
[133:06.73]That's as big as an encyclopedia with the pictures?
[133:19.27]All prior accomplishments.
[133:22.05]Yeah, sorry I wanted to, uh, keep the Nancy Drew stream on track.
[133:31.49]All prior accomplishments are null.
[133:36.59]Oh, he's stuttering.
[133:37.33]He's stuttering.
[133:37.97]He's stuttering.
[133:41.31]Hey, Little Kitty, thanks for the 500 bits.
[133:43.09]They say, good job.
[133:43.91]Thank you.
[133:45.63]Hey, you did a good job, too, in whatever you did today.
[133:50.12]Thank you.
[133:54.68]Influx Meme, thanks for the 300 bits.
[133:58.80]This is a two-part message.
[134:01.66]This is the second part of my message.
[134:06.07]Oh, I see what you're saying here.
[134:06.97]Okay.
[134:08.65]Just want to say your huge influence you've had on my life as I approach my 20s.
[134:12.96]Your videos and streams have always brought me comfort whenever times have been tough.
[134:15.94]And your unique brand of comedy has influenced the stuff I like so much you have no idea.
[134:20.70]I know you've probably heard this stuff before, but you really have a huge impact on your viewers.
[134:24.40]And I give the German a heart for this absolute chad of a man.
[134:36.83]I really appreciate that.
[134:37.93]That's a lot of nice things to say about somebody.
[134:43.81]And then you say, one of your early TF2 Q&A videos, you were initially going to delete your channel, but a friend stopped you and told you to just see where it took you.
[134:53.77]Do you sometimes think about that?
[134:54.86]What would have been had you not taken that chance?
[134:57.14]And you still talk to that person who was at Burger Boy.
[135:01.32]Not sure of my path in life, so you don't have any advice.
[135:03.56]I'm not sure of my path in life.
[135:04.62]Do you have any advice for me?
[135:05.70]Thank you.
[135:07.53]Mod that friend.
[135:08.45]Well, here's the thing.
[135:14.79]Anytime you start something new, right?
[135:18.80]It doesn't matter what it is.
[135:21.92]After you do it for the first time and you go through with it, you have that first initial bump of, this is dumb.
[135:32.20]This is, I should, I probably shouldn't have done this.
[135:34.26]This is like kind of dumb, right?
[135:35.74]Like, it's like, I could probably use my time somewhere else.
[135:40.36]Uh, nah, yeah, I'll do something else.
[135:42.89]That happened to me all the time.
[135:51.75]I'm in Vegas right now and over 21 this time.
[135:56.35]And if memory serves me correctly, it was a long time ago.
[136:01.49]I don't, I don't remember if it was Burger Boy or not.
[136:04.67]Maybe, I think it was one of my, somebody that I went to college with.
[136:09.92]Maybe it was, no.
[136:10.98]Who was it?
[136:14.24]This is going to fucking eat me up now.
[136:15.68]Who said to like just, I said that I made a YouTube channel.
[136:24.97]I did!
[136:29.60]I showed my diploma on stream.
[136:32.30]Did you see it?
[136:32.88]From Blockbuster?
[136:38.91]I don't remember who it was.
[136:39.85]That'll probably come to me.
[136:44.25]Like, later tonight or something.
[136:45.59]I don't think it was Burger Boy.
[136:48.92]But they watched the two or three videos that were there.
[136:52.20]Which, by the way, I deleted and re-uploaded, I think, twice.
[136:56.18]For some reason.
[136:59.80]Because once, like, three or four, five views came in, I was like, These videos suck!
[137:05.28]I have to redo them!
[137:06.40]Somebody watched them!
[137:07.00]I have to make it better!
[137:13.08]I'm pretty sure I deleted and re-uploaded the same three videos, like, twice.
[137:17.52]But...
[137:19.77]I was told, who cares?
[137:22.49]Just let them ride.
[137:23.87]It doesn't matter.
[137:24.45]I'm gonna have to fucking go searching for like, who fucking said that?
[137:31.08]Who was that?
[137:34.56]Maybe it was Burger Boy.
[137:35.62]Because we were going to the gym all the time.
[137:40.02]Me and Burger Boy, believe it or not, were in the gym three, four plus days a week.
[137:45.64]Back then.
[137:47.05]And I think I just offhandedly maybe told them, yeah, I don't know.
[137:51.53]Just two chads going to the gym.
[137:56.76]But what would I have done if that was... I mean, I don't know.
[137:59.86]I don't know.
[138:00.30]I can't rewind the clock and do another life.
[138:05.80]What probably would have happened is I would have gone into something... I would have just continued doing the stuff that I liked already.
[138:11.02]I was really into...
[138:15.70]stuff with animals.
[138:16.52]You know, like, volunteering.
[138:19.08]I was probably gonna maybe go to, like, vet tech school.
[138:22.21]I still ended up volunteering for a while.
[138:30.35]But, yeah, that's sometimes I think about what would happen if I had not made half of those videos that I made in the first two months that I started this channel.
[138:44.94]What would have happened if my first TF2, the Uber update video, didn't get on the TF2 Reddit?
[138:55.11]What would have happened?
[138:56.49]Would I even be sitting here right now doing this?
[139:00.03]Probably not.
[139:03.71]Probably not.
[139:08.01]You would go be an English teacher in Japan.
[139:11.05]I can barely speak English.
[139:12.23]You think I can teach somebody how?
[139:21.47]But any advice?
[139:26.13]Don't get in your own way.
[139:32.65]Because what you are describing is me almost getting in my way to a point where I didn't do any of this stuff.
[139:40.54]Don't get in your own way.
[139:49.96]Got it.
[139:51.56]Now I'm worth over a billion dollars.
[139:56.98]I wish you luck, though, Influx.
[140:00.06]Thanks for sticking around.
[140:02.38]Really interesting thought, though.
[140:04.02]Haven't thought about that in a long time.
[140:06.61]Tar Alecran, thanks for the $2.50.
[140:07.77]German, have you played Heaven's Vault on stream?
[140:09.75]It's made... Hold on.
[140:14.41]It's made by the same crew that made Sorcery, and it's an amazing adventure game in its own right.
[140:18.11]Goddammit, I'm gonna, like, burp.
[140:19.37]Hold on.
[140:24.60]Alright, we're good.
[140:26.76]I've not played Heaven's Vault.
[140:28.80]I'll have to look into that.
[140:30.24]By my ankle.
[140:33.12]I'll check it out.
[140:35.01]That stream will be starting probably around 6 o'clock.
[140:36.75]Pacific.
[140:37.03]Pacific.
[140:52.07]9 p.m.
[140:52.81]Eastern, we'll catch the Eastern ball drop.
[140:56.35]And if there's enough time, maybe we'll catch the Pacific one as well.
[141:00.96]Maybe.
[141:04.56]I was not with Kim last year on New Year's.
[141:11.71]So I think I might want to kind of end it after the Eastern ball drop.
[141:19.81]Because last year I didn't spend New Year's with Kim.
[141:23.41]And... You know, there's an opportunity to this year, so... So, yeah.
[141:34.88]It'll be a solid, probably... We'll at least get one or two of them.
[141:46.44]Dermot loves his Eastern Time Zone viewers.
[141:50.22]I mean, I spent my entire life on the Eastern time zone, so... And everybody bases pretty much everything on the Eastern time zone.
[142:03.76]EST is just... So much media is dictated by what time it is Eastern.
[142:19.26]That being said, I do love PST, though, because I gain three hours.
[142:23.72]I get three hours on all of you.
[142:25.00]Right now, it's 10 o'clock.
[142:28.57]It used to be 1 a.m.
[142:30.05]when I would turn the stream off back in Massachusetts.
[142:33.27]It's 10 o'clock.
[142:33.95]I can still get a pizza.
[142:39.40]But thank you, Freudian.
[142:40.20]I mean...
[143:10.56]You live by the meme, you die by the meme.
[143:15.76]Do you live long enough to see yourself become the villain?
[143:20.05]We'll see.
[143:30.03]Don't forget to vote for Stuffya.
[143:35.21]Subscribe for more, plus like if you did.
[143:37.41]Thank you, Level 6.
[143:41.83]Happy New Year to you as well.
[143:42.65]So yeah, just stay tuned for that show on New Year's Eve.
[144:10.48]It was the hardest choice on the list.
[144:13.08]There were a lot of nominations.
[144:15.50]It was actually hard to remove some because there was just so many in every category.
[144:22.83]At least 10 of those categories were full with 25 plus nominations.
[144:28.17]It was just, there's so many.
[144:31.69]So, I'm glad there was enough time this year for people to at least have that week to kind of think about something they thought was fun.
[144:39.50]Rather than two days.
[144:40.44]Yeah, it's been a great year.
[144:43.36]A lot of stuff has changed for me this year.
[144:44.96]You know, moved across the country.
[144:48.49]Started to do the stuff that I wanted to do many, many years ago.
[144:52.57]Get into some more high production, high octave streams.
[145:00.19]And I plan on just kind of keeping that going for as long as I can, right?
[145:08.91]Cheers to you.
[145:09.61]Thank you, Reaper.
[145:12.23]Dr. Cad, thank you for the 500 bits.
[145:16.22]I need you to watch a video just a little bit.
[145:18.12]It's a music video, but I think you'll enjoy it.
[145:20.18]Music video?
[145:20.86]What do you mean?
[145:21.24]This video is 28 minutes long.
[145:34.88]What the hell is this?
[145:36.86]What is going on?
[145:37.66]Oh, this is, like, scary.
[145:38.42]Turtle Dreams.
[146:04.64]This video is 30 minutes long.
[146:06.04]I'm gonna get gnomed, I might.
[146:12.05]I feel like I wanna skip.
[146:34.14]It's a pretty good video.
[146:42.80]It's 30 minutes of that.
[146:43.86]I don't want to watch that.
[146:44.90]That's a long time to sit there and watch that.
[146:54.48]Yeah, there's the link.
[146:55.14]It's right there.
[146:58.90]It's just a little bit.
[146:59.90]It's a music video.
[147:06.14]Hey Flustered Flamingo, thanks for the 300 bits.
[147:08.49]Hey German, thanks for the laughs this decade.
[147:10.67]Quick question, if you owned the internet for one day, what would you change?
[147:18.07]I would delete Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok.
[147:25.46]I would delete all social media.
[147:29.86]But not Twitch though, because that's cool, it's fun.
[147:32.74]I would delete all social media.
[147:37.88]No, even Twitch.
[147:38.94]Even Twitch.
[147:39.42]And YouTube.
[147:39.89]Delete it all.
[147:40.55]Get rid of it.
[147:46.51]There would be instant replacements.
[147:49.41]No, and I would have broadcasted on every airway.
[147:52.59]Do I have control of the airways?
[147:53.75]No, I don't.
[147:58.79]But even just... Oh, they'd instantly get replaced.
[148:04.57]But even just for one day...
[148:09.32]If everybody didn't have to use it.
[148:14.36]Even for one day.
[148:16.91]Even for three days.
[148:20.99]Announce it on Twitter.
[148:24.91]Hot boomer take.
[148:29.26]That's a villain thing to do.
[148:31.22]Is that a villain thing to do though?
[148:33.04]Really think about that.
[148:45.16]We will rebuild it.
[148:53.06]Facebook and TikTok, no.
[148:54.50]The rest, yes.
[148:56.52]You're a Sunday morning cartoon villain.
[149:00.50]Yeah, and then when Scooby-Doo and crew stop texting each other and they go play tetherball and then they go, whoa!
[149:12.55]Maniacal Martin sure was actually right, wasn't he?
[149:16.88]We enjoyed some time outside.
[149:20.92]Should we go get him out of jail?
[149:23.06]Nah, nah, let him rot.
[149:24.90]Oh, okay.
[149:37.83]Boomer, hot boomer take.
[149:40.23]Now, if I had control of the internet...
[149:43.72]No, okay, I wouldn't delete all social media.
[149:45.76]I would take it all over.
[149:48.54]And I would make one tweet and one post on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, on TikTok.
[149:54.33]It would just be, I'm only writing this so people still don't think I'm at TwitchCon.
[150:01.36]Dash Germa.
[150:07.92]right going live tonight here's the link and try to break ninja's record for like concurrent people on a stream everybody come to this link and just be there so I can get like 700 000 concurrent viewers for 10 seconds oh by the way do any musicians want to play a video game
[150:48.78]He'd still be late.
[150:52.94]Now, if I control the internet, I don't know what the fuck I would do.
[150:58.20]I'd get scared.
[151:05.57]No, way better.
[151:06.97]Yeah, I would take over all social media.
[151:09.65]And what I would simply do, this is the perfect take on this whole scenario.
[151:15.64]All I would do, I wouldn't delete them.
[151:17.88]I wouldn't get rid of them.
[151:19.02]I wouldn't take over and tweet something myself.
[151:21.50]All social media platforms, all text would just be what happens when an orc tries to talk to a human in Warcraft.
[151:34.69]Done.
[151:37.58]Good luck.
[151:44.13]You could be the only source of porn on the planet.
[151:50.80]What are you talking about?
[152:03.20]Why would that be the thing I go to?
[152:11.27]Anyways.
[152:13.68]Thank you, Flustered Flamingo, for the 300 bits.
[152:15.94]Appreciate it.
[152:17.76]Gnarly, thanks for 250.
[152:18.61]I know I said that I couldn't donate for a while, but I will gladly go into debt to tell you.
[152:22.97]Don't go into debt.
[152:24.53]Don't go into debt to give me money.
[152:25.95]Don't do that.
[152:27.07]Number one.
[152:27.65]Number two.
[152:28.03]Let's see what you said.
[152:30.15]To not listen to the garbage that the Drew crew spews.
[152:33.89]She's not even a real detective.
[152:35.17]Nancy Drew, more like Nancy Fuck You.
[152:40.11]Damn.
[152:40.25]Damn.
[152:43.91]That's harsh.
[152:46.33]That's really harsh.
[152:50.41]That's a pretty hot take, yeah.
[152:53.61]Don't go into debt for giving me money.
[152:55.89]Ever.
[152:56.17]For any reason.
[152:58.51]Keep that.
[152:59.33]Bank it.
[153:03.67]But thank you for the $250, though.
[153:08.13]Drew Hader is out.
[153:11.82]Hey Shmoo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[153:13.86]Thank you Shmoo.
[153:14.72]Been a viewer since your first Surgeon Simulator 2013 video.
[153:17.40]They're coming out with a new one too.
[153:19.86]You helped me recently get through an isolating period in my life.
[153:23.19]I often think about your advice on persistence when things don't happen immediately.
[153:27.03]Also the fact that you've never shit in a public bathroom.
[153:29.81]You got a lot of dedication and that's inspiring as hell.
[153:34.15]Yes, that is true.
[153:35.77]That is still true.
[153:37.65]I have never taken a shit in a public bathroom.
[153:42.30]It has never happened in my entire life.
[153:45.00]Not once.
[153:46.16]Never.
[153:51.54]That's not false.
[153:52.75]I wish I could prove that somehow.
[153:54.33]I've never taken a shit in a public bathroom.
[154:00.11]That's fine.
[154:00.51]You don't have to believe me.
[154:01.27]I just know it's true.
[154:02.13]I know it's true.
[154:06.87]Someday you won't have a choice.
[154:11.47]That day has not happened yet.
[154:14.11]Now, I don't count... I do not count private bathrooms.
[154:24.94]So, yes, I have taken a shit in a private bathroom, one where it's one person, you go and you can lock the door.
[154:33.28]Right?
[154:34.65]Like, what do you classify as a public bathroom?
[154:39.43]Changing the definition.
[154:41.65]That counts as a public bathroom.
[154:44.29]A public space, public private bathroom.
[154:46.51]A private bathroom is one not in your house.
[154:54.18]More than one stall is a public bathroom.
[154:56.76]Well, I guess a single toilet with a locked door is technically a bathroom for the public.
[155:03.89]But it is a private bathroom.
[155:07.37]It's a private bathroom in public.
[155:09.43]Yeah.
[155:17.19]No, it's not.
[155:18.08]It's a private bathroom in... No, that's perfect.
[155:22.66]If it's not in someone's house, it's a public bathroom.
[155:25.14]Yeah, okay, so I've taken a shit in a public bathroom in a private setting.
[155:31.30]Maybe once or twice.
[155:33.53]but I've never taken a shit in a multi-stall bathroom.
[155:40.22]If literally anybody can walk in, it's public, but I can lock the door.
[155:45.72]If I go into a bathroom that's one toilet, I can lock the door and just exist and be all right.
[155:54.50]So is that a public bathroom?
[155:58.84]If you can't walk in there,
[156:01.20]It's now my temporary private bathroom.
[156:17.59]A real public bathroom has a toilet with encircling theater seats.
[156:21.45]Holy shit, why did I read that?
[156:22.73]I just did.
[156:25.89]I never thought this much about the walls I shit surrounded by.
[156:34.80]German public bathroom.
[156:36.10]It's public.
[156:38.62]If you lock yourself in a school gym, it's not a private space.
[156:41.88]Yeah, but I'm not taking a shit.
[156:45.16]The school gym is not supposed to be a private setting.
[156:50.69]Pulling my pants down and going to the bathroom is a private setting.
[156:54.71]It's a private place.
[156:57.42]I'm not going to go to the bathroom in the gym.
[157:01.97]It's open to the public, so it is public.
[157:03.67]Yes, it's a public bathroom, but it's a private section of the public... Alright, listen.
[157:12.17]I've taken a shit in a public bathroom, but never a multi-stall public bathroom.
[157:15.76]There you go, done.
[157:20.26]What's going on?
[157:23.12]All bathrooms are private.
[157:25.60]We can't sit here and argue semantics.
[157:27.67]I've been trying to for the last, like, five minutes.
[157:39.42]Then you shit in a public bathroom.
[157:41.46]Your semantics are bad.
[157:43.24]What about that person that said all bathrooms are private?
[157:47.00]A bathroom is a private place.
[157:48.77]This is the best comment of the night.
[158:02.54]Who the fuck cares?
[158:06.39]Yeah, that's true.
[158:09.41]That's right.
[158:09.97]Like, who the fuck cares?
[158:12.41]Who cares if I've never taken a shit in a multi-stall public bathroom?
[158:20.99]You do.
[158:21.84]I do.
[158:22.92]Hey, Buttsquire, thanks for the $2.50.
[158:24.82]Seeing you react that way to germs on a Wiimote reminded me of something.
[158:28.88]What does it remind you of?
[158:34.84]This is a full video.
[158:36.56]I'm gonna watch this full video.
[158:42.35]Have you ever peed your pants?
[158:47.45]Yes.
[158:49.61]Probably at least a dozen times.
[159:03.16]yes I have peed my pants not in my adult life maybe when I was like a nine ten years old or something hey very nice thanks for the 750 german listen to this three months ago I visited a museum dedicated to native american artifacts and memorabilia
[159:26.16]I eventually came upon a dark and foreboding mask with crimson feathers adorning it.
[159:31.44]When I stared into its hollow eyes, it had something like a spirit trip or a vision.
[159:35.76]I saw everyone I knew and loved become great bears, soaring eagles, and trampling buffalo.
[159:42.26]Then I woke up on a bench in the museum lobby.
[159:44.58]Have you ever had anything like that happen to you?
[159:46.74]Don't do drugs before you go to a museum.
[159:53.90]That's probably the moral of that story.
[160:01.16]Say no, don't do drugs.
[160:06.22]That was very well written.
[160:10.50]It was.
[160:11.30]You're right.
[160:13.02]Can we get back to the game?
[160:16.18]Oh.
[160:18.24]Noobosaurus, the stream is over.
[160:21.66]If you might be new, then that's fine.
[160:24.67]I don't think you are, though.
[160:25.39]I think I've seen your name before.
[160:27.76]At the end of the stream, we do all the donations that came in that have reached a certain threshold.
[160:33.77]We talk about stuff.
[160:34.59]We just chill out for like 30, 40 minutes.
[160:37.47]Sometimes less, sometimes more.
[160:42.23]Just play the game.
[160:43.51]The stream's over.
[160:44.01]This is the post-stream wrap-up hangout session.
[160:55.84]It's been on this screen for six hours.
[160:57.96]That would be bad.
[160:58.62]Hey, Matty Eyes, thanks for the 510 bits.
[161:07.63]Watching through the old clips while I was voting for New Year's Eve stream was so fun.
[161:10.45]Looking forward to plenty more fun times.
[161:12.65]Wishing everyone a fun and safe New Year's.
[161:14.93]Much love and may the New Year bring great things.
[161:18.25]Let's hope so.
[161:20.55]I hope so.
[161:20.91]Thank you.
[161:25.85]Snipers, thanks for the thousand bits.
[161:27.61]Here's some bits for that pizza.
[161:29.77]And we'll be getting a nice thin-crust pepperoni pizza.
[161:32.95]I'm gonna just slowly enjoy it while I watch... Surprise Eggs videos.
[161:42.42]Oh, I can't wait.
[161:49.17]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[161:52.37]Very nice again.
[161:53.13]Thanks for the 250 bits.
[161:54.42]You made me buy 250 more bits because you made so much sense when you talked about the necessity of simplicity in pizza.
[162:01.18]I was right there with you.
[162:02.20]I felt you.
[162:02.68]I've been telling people that for about five years now, but no one listens to me.
[162:06.36]Maybe they'll listen to the greatest internet entertainer alive.
[162:09.31]Jerma985.
[162:09.83]Hey, if you like whatever pizza you like, you like it.
[162:20.22]That's you donating to yourself.
[162:40.49]wrong pizza opinion pepperoni is greasy as fuck I like pepperoni on pizza it may it adds like a nice delicious smoky flavor especially when the pepperonis are really crispy when you bite into pepperoni you get that pepperoni crunch that's like almost like with the candy pepperoni oh
[163:08.66]I'm... It's the best.
[163:10.78]It's the best.
[163:14.74]And then when you get... Sometimes when pepperoni... Not all pizza places do this, but some of them do.
[163:21.01]When you have pizza in the oven, right?
[163:24.17]And there's pepperoni on it.
[163:25.99]After a little while, the little pepperoni discs turn into these... Almost these little bowls, right?
[163:33.14]Right?
[163:35.77]And inside the little cooked pepperoni bowls is a few droplets of this delicious, magical liquid.
[163:49.14]And then when you bite into it and you get the crunch of the little pepperoni bowl and the sauce and the little oil.
[163:57.75]It's called liquid fat.
[163:59.51]Yeah, and that's good.
[164:01.83]Just don't eat it every day.
[164:06.62]That's fucking heinous.
[164:07.80]No, it's not.
[164:08.44]What?
[164:10.10]Do I like bacon crispy or soggy?
[164:11.96]Crispy, crunchy.
[164:13.70]Crispity, crunchity.
[164:14.76]Don't give me any soggy bacon.
[164:18.74]Gross.
[164:31.07]Who likes soggy bacon?
[164:34.13]Yeah, I don't, I don't see a, why would soggy bacon, I wouldn't want to eat soggy bacon.
[164:44.82]Crunchy pepperoni balls are the best food in the world, don't change my mind.
[164:47.32]I'm not trying to, I'm agreeing with you.
[164:51.54]Turkey bacon is also awesome, that's true.
[164:54.74]Hey, grey blob, that's a thousand bits.
[164:56.24]The only pizza toppings worth a damn are bacon and green pepper.
[165:00.07]Bacon's all right in small doses.
[165:02.29]I don't like it all over the pizza, but if it's kind of put out there, crushed up gently.
[165:07.69]I don't like green pepper on pizza.
[165:14.77]I like a simple pizza.
[165:15.69]I like just cheese, pepperoni, like margarita style pizzas.
[165:20.63]I like just simple, simple, simple, simple.
[165:34.80]that gray blob thanks for the thousand bits uh me must thanks for the 250 hey german here's the protection money I know it's not the agreed amount but please don't kill me uh that two dollars and that's 250 bits that's not a protection money that's not protection money from what are you talking about I'm not you're I'm not doing anything
[165:57.51]That's not enough, no.
[165:58.69]I'm just saying that's... I'm just saying like a $2.50 is not like... That's not protection money.
[166:09.04]That's alright, it's not... If you walked up to me and said, hey, here's $2.50, man, it's my protection money.
[166:20.53]I'd be like, just fucking go buy yourself like a pack of gum.
[166:27.53]He's saying that.
[166:28.35]No, I'm not saying that.
[166:35.25]Here's 250.
[166:36.04]Don't kill me!
[166:37.58]No, I'm not gonna kill you over 250, dude.
[166:39.12]What are you talking about?
[166:40.36]That's not... That's what I'm saying.
[166:43.32]I'm not gonna... $2.50, man.
[166:44.10]Like, I'm not gonna... No one's gonna die over 250.
[167:08.22]Guys, there's no crime movies that are ever made.
[167:11.83]There's no mafia movies that are ever made where the guy opens up a briefcase and there's $2.50 in it.
[167:17.81]For the big switch.
[167:24.26]That would be a really shitty movie.
[167:42.98]Do you take Bitcoin?
[167:44.06]I used to until nobody did it.
[167:47.71]I used to have an Ethereum address down in the description.
[167:51.13]And over the course of seven months, I think like four dollars of Ethereum came in.
[167:58.61]And I closed it.
[167:59.40]I never told anybody.
[168:00.44]I was like, yeah, I'm like, I'm out of here.
[168:02.42]I'm like, no one's using this.
[168:09.72]How much is that four dollars worth now?
[168:16.10]Probably less.
[168:18.42]Probably a lot less.
[168:20.44]Why are people spamming this video?
[168:22.06]No, I'm not.
[168:22.92]I'm gonna have pizza, for God's sake.
[168:37.71]Post your ETH address and I'll give you $100.
[168:41.31]I don't even know what it is.
[168:42.29]I don't even remember.
[168:47.45]Just fuck my shit up.
[168:52.57]That video's old news.
[168:53.59]Yeah, that video was circulated like a year and a half ago.
[168:59.89]For the life of me, I can't find the no emotion stream.
[169:01.93]What?
[169:02.15]I don't even know what it was.
[169:07.74]You know the address?
[169:09.62]Well, don't send $100 to that address because I'm not even sure I can get into that account.
[169:12.92]It was hotlavaNGU.
[169:18.12]That's right.
[169:19.64]That's true.
[169:19.98]Do you have an OnlyFans?
[169:24.65]I don't know what that is.
[169:27.15]No.
[169:32.93]Anyways, we're almost at the end.
[169:34.21]Gnarly thanks for the $250.
[169:41.62]Oh yeah, I had a dream on Christmas Eve where I woke up at 6am on Christmas morning to you streaming.
[169:45.86]You were being recorded by a camera behind you, and you were playing League of Legends on a tiny laptop.
[169:51.49]Hope your Christmas went better than dream germas.
[170:02.74]Alright, here comes the credits.
[170:05.22]Here comes all the subs.
[170:07.30]Thanks a lot, guys.
[170:07.94]See you tomorrow for No More Heroes.
[170:10.71]I'm going to get it to work somehow.
[170:11.91]I will.
[170:12.71]I will figure it out.
[170:13.43]Even if we have to play it on original hardware, I will.
[170:15.55]We'll figure it out.
[170:28.36]He didn't say it was better.
[170:30.00]No, my Christmas was fine.
[170:31.36]My Christmas was good.
[170:33.28]I had a relaxing Christmas.
[170:36.16]It was nice.
[170:39.30]But, that's a weird dream.
[170:42.25]Why would it be on a tiny laptop?
[170:43.51]You can't play games on a tiny laptop unless it's a Candy Crush.
[170:48.57]Which, why would you play Candy Crush in the first place?
[170:54.18]There are only two places where you play Candy Crush.
[170:57.94]And one is... In the... In the airplane.
[171:03.09]Because it's on one of those weird devices that has weird games on it.
[171:06.61]Or sitting at the one... Like, sitting at Chili's.
[171:13.87]Because it's on that little kiosk thing that's on the tables.
[171:18.46]Otherwise, there's no reason to play that game.
[171:27.87]Should I do a... No.
[171:29.15]Yeah.
[171:29.55]I'll do a Candy Crush stream.
[171:30.63]No, I won't.
[171:31.31]Lie.
[171:32.15]Yes, I will.
[171:32.65]What are my thoughts on acne videos?
[171:39.25]I don't... What do you mean acne videos?
[171:40.60]Videos about people's acne or videos about people, like, popping pimples?
[171:46.00]Which, both of those, I'm going to say I don't think I want to watch them.
[171:53.48]Hey, Lula.
[171:55.16]Lula, thanks for another 500 bits here.
[171:56.88]My son is 10, but he's aware of entertainment versus reality, so swears aren't a big deal in our house.
[172:03.01]He knows I'd kick his ass if he talked like you.
[172:05.75]Oh, my God.
[172:07.17]But he's allowed to enjoy the show.
[172:08.91]Believe it or not, your content's pretty wholesome, really.
[172:24.82]If you think so.
[172:29.50]As much as we fuck around, I do try to just have, I try to stay, I try to have fun.
[172:35.34]I don't ever want it to be like a downer stream.
[172:40.16]I know sometimes I can fly off the handle and then I can have little episodes.
[172:46.45]But for the most part, I like to just have fun.
[172:49.67]And I don't want to have fun in mean, bad ways, I guess.
[172:56.94]Unless it's for, you know, we're joking around with, like, channel stuff.
[173:04.74]Oh, let's put it this way.
[173:05.34]I never want anyone to feel bad when they watch this stream.
[173:10.94]Like, truly be like, oh, I feel like shit watching this stream.
[173:13.72]I don't like this.
[173:14.72]I feel awful.
[173:17.96]I don't want you to feel bad.
[173:19.84]That's completely against why I do this in the first place.
[173:23.62]I want to have fun.
[173:29.98]You killed God, though.
[173:33.02]Yeah, and, like, that was a lot of fun.
[173:45.35]You're a psycho.
[173:46.73]I'm not... Look.
[173:52.16]Fine.
[173:52.76]You can have your... You can have your little... You can have your fun.
[173:57.82]I'm not going to clip that.
[173:58.68]That's fucked up.
[174:02.15]What?
[174:02.25]Are you guys trying to protect me now?
[174:05.87]Should I be paying you protection money?
[174:13.61]Alright, we're almost done.
[174:14.15]We're at the end.
[174:14.57]We have... But seriously, thanks for the subs, everybody.
[174:18.95]There's a ton of you now.
[174:23.35]Thanks for letting me continue to do this.
[174:25.81]All of you.
[174:28.49]But thank you, Lula, for the 500 bits.
[174:30.09]Thank you, Space Marine, for the 1500 bits.
[174:33.78]I just got out of my most difficult semester that I've ever had in schooling.
[174:37.18]I'm a chemical engineer junior at a private university, so we've got a fucking real smart one here.
[174:45.72]We bring this up, but seriously, chemical engineers in chat, doctors, lawyers, dentists.
[174:59.33]This past semester has crushed me.
[175:02.47]Academically, socially, mentally.
[175:05.01]You're one of the few people that can always make me smile and laugh, even when I have been beaten down.
[175:08.55]I wanted to give back even a small amount for the great things you've done for my happiness.
[175:12.87]Thank you for being you.
[175:14.47]Dribble heart.
[175:21.72]Thanks a lot.
[175:23.86]Hopefully your, the hardest part of your schooling is over and you can relax a little bit and it won't be as bad the next time or when you graduate, you know, obviously when you're getting close.
[175:39.08]Thank you so much for the 1500 bits.
[175:44.38]I wish you luck on your journey of becoming a chemical engineer.
[175:50.34]Thanks for watching.
[175:51.14]Thanks for sticking around.
[175:55.22]Don't push yourself too hard.
[176:12.99]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[176:14.99]I work as a movie theater usher and have to clean up the movie theaters.
[176:18.07]Every time you end the stream, it reminds me of my job.
[176:20.56]So dirty.
[176:22.22]Love the streams, big guy.
[176:26.08]Thank you, Chump.
[176:26.74]And maybe if you guys would pick up after yourselves at throwing shit, dumping drinks on the ground.
[176:35.99]Come on.
[176:40.27]The germ plexus theater has been open since 1981, okay?
[176:45.95]I know that when you're walking, it makes that horrible sound.
[176:54.93]But that's because people are just throwing shit on the ground and they're being disgusting.
[177:09.05]When I go to the movies, I buy two drinks and just dump one on the floor.
[177:12.31]That's kind of what it feels like sometimes in some of these theaters.
[177:17.09]That people are just buying extra popcorn so they can just dump it on the ground.
[177:24.01]It's like somebody goes into the movie theater and they buy a bunch of those... They buy like two boxes of dots.
[177:33.12]And a lighter.
[177:35.22]And they just slowly melt down...
[177:38.26]All the dots in the container.
[177:40.76]And then just slide out and smear the dot candy sludge shit all over the ground.
[177:46.86]And all over the seats.
[177:55.59]How does a floor even get like that?
[178:05.79]What am I talking about?
[178:06.53]I'm talking about every movie theater.
[178:08.05]Well, no, that's not even true.
[178:09.33]Because movie theaters nowadays, a lot of them are like really nice.
[178:13.75]Reclining chairs.
[178:15.19]It's like room service.
[178:19.31]Have you heard about this?
[178:21.06]You can get room service to your chair in some theaters now.
[178:23.96]You press a button and a flight attendant comes down and is like, oh, what do you want?
[178:28.30]I'll take the ham and cheese and... That's crazy.
[178:40.93]That's $15 a ticket.
[178:44.47]I don't... But here's the thing.
[178:45.79]I don't think I'd want to do that.
[178:48.31]Imagine ordering a full dinner at a movie.
[178:50.67]You're like watching the movie.
[178:51.73]Your ticket bites out of like an avocado BLT melt turkey sandwich.
[178:56.59]And like it's getting all over you.
[178:57.63]And you're like wiping with fucking napkins.
[178:59.47]And what happened on the screen?
[179:01.97]Like you're eating like a full spaghetti dinner.
[179:03.67]Like... Oh, what?
[179:05.05]Hold on.
[179:05.37]I'm like eating a full dinner and it's dark.
[179:08.23]It's pitch black in there.
[179:13.83]They have little tables.
[179:14.63]Yeah, but I don't want to eat in the dark.
[179:19.72]There are some things you can eat in the dark.
[179:21.14]Popcorn, pretzel bites, corn chips, and those little hot dog bites.
[179:31.84]Get a whole lobster.
[179:37.06]Alright, let's get out of here.
[179:40.26]al store h2o thanks for the 250. speaking of you in college you've been approached by your college to come speak to students no no not even close hey guys welcome to the graduating class of 2024 and the man giving the speech today to congratulate you all is one of our alma mater
[180:06.49]You might have absolutely no fucking idea who this guy is.
[180:09.85]He got popular by playing Team Fortress 2 and saying the word shpee over and over again.
[180:15.31]And by getting his ass kicked by one of his close friends, who would get him to a point where he'd get so angry that he would start screaming the F word.
[180:26.96]And he was recorded without his knowledge and uploaded to YouTube.
[180:30.34]Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, that's where he got his start, Jerma985.
[180:32.50]And the three people in the audience would be like,
[180:42.28]And I'd have a wicked red face.
[180:44.70]Hey, hey, hey everybody.
[180:46.34]Oh, I don't feel so good.
[180:51.13]I'm nervous.

[180:53.65]It's cool.
[180:54.65]Keep at it, everybody.
[180:55.47]Okay, I gotta get out of here.
[180:56.51]Congratulations, everybody.

[181:16.63]No.
[181:20.90]No, to answer your question, nobody knows who the fuck I am.
[181:23.88]Outside of, you know, this space.
[181:28.14]I don't think there's very many people that... You also mentioned... Granted, my old college hasn't asked Logan Paul to come speak, but I can see colleges thinking it's something students would be interested in.
[181:45.37]Would they?
[181:47.39]No, you want somebody at your college speech to be somebody that can tell you... You need like a president or something.
[181:56.01]Or like a senator.
[181:58.19]I can't make that speech.
[182:02.91]I came back to the stream to hear that.
[182:09.56]Oh, I'm sorry.
[182:11.34]How bad was that?
[182:12.02]Was that bad?
[182:14.79]It wasn't that bad, was it?
[182:24.12]Sorry.
[182:24.74]What do you mean, sorry?
[182:26.80]It was pretty bad?
[182:28.08]Yeah.
