[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.35]Hello.
[00:01.79]Welcome to another edition of Jeremy Plays Something and we go, what the fuck?
[00:13.94]Today's what the fuck moment is visceral cleanup detail.
[00:25.27]Alright, that over here.
[00:29.51]Stream detected, yep.
[00:32.11]And I'm sorry to say, today is going to be a short stream.
[00:40.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, before anybody gets angry.
[00:43.05]Just wait, hold on.
[00:49.56]Uh, I need to make sure that the Christmas stream is taken care of.
[00:55.89]I need to get packages ordered.
[00:58.05]I need to get paper and the people that are involved with the project need to be brought up to speed and it's a whole ordeal.
[01:07.65]So to make sure that I can get that going, I've already been doing it kind of today and the day before yesterday.
[01:15.09]So the reason why there's a short stream today is because of the Christmas Eve stream.
[01:19.91]So here I'm going to give you the plan for the next few days.
[01:24.59]Because this is kind of the holiday schedule, right?
[01:29.83]I got to go to the doctor tomorrow.
[01:31.11]So that really has nothing to do with it.
[01:32.25]But the appointment is in the afternoon.
[01:35.32]So I can't stream really.
[01:38.88]And it gives me another day to make sure everything can get done.
[01:42.41]So, one, two, three.
[01:44.63]Here's the schedule for this week.
[01:46.25]Nothing tomorrow.
[01:47.47]Stream on Saturday.
[01:48.71]Nothing on Sunday.
[01:50.29]Christmas Eve stream on the 24th.
[01:53.78]And then, two days later, I'll see you again after the holiday.
[01:58.70]So I'll see you guys probably on like the 26th or the 27th.
[02:00.98]End of the stream voice.
[02:06.44]Already.
[02:08.44]No, I mean, short as in...
[02:11.77]Less than four hours, but more than two.
[02:13.99]You know what I mean?
[02:17.83]And to continue to talk about this, because of the nature of the packages and the Secret Santa chat suggestions, I gotta get this shit ordered.
[02:31.07]So you really only have another couple hours for any suggestions.
[02:45.26]If you have any suggestions on what you'd like me to open on the Christmas Eve stream.
[02:52.10]And I'm going to break down the rules one more time just because I think there are probably plenty of people that may not know what I'm talking about because I literally only brought it up yesterday.
[03:01.45]So, Christmas Eve I'm going to be opening up presents from you guys.
[03:05.97]But I'm going to be buying them.
[03:07.93]I'm not going to be buying them.
[03:09.28]A third party will be purchasing them.
[03:13.56]I don't know what they're going to be.
[03:14.34]I don't know what they are.
[03:16.69]Your suggestions in that Discord channel, by the way.
[03:21.02]Only up to three suggestions per person.
[03:23.78]Nobody buy it, you don't buy anything.
[03:25.24]You just give an Amazon link that has a primable shipping.
[03:30.26]And the mods are going to determine if that would be fun to open, or if that would be something that they would want to put on the list.
[03:37.67]Up to $50 per suggestion.
[03:41.23]No more than that.
[03:44.59]No live animals.
[03:46.57]No sexual stuff.
[03:49.35]No perishable items.
[03:51.99]They're your criteria.
[03:56.00]So, no, it's not gonna happen.
[03:58.18]That's why the mods are responsible for selecting what they determine to be worth opening, I guess.
[04:09.76]Basically everything hold on so that so nothing exists nothing in the world exists besides bugs rats like dildos and Like sandwiches are you sure?
[04:24.06]Are you sure about this?
[04:30.85]Nothing else in the world exists.
[04:32.69]There's no other items.
[04:33.55]Oh
[04:38.50]Anyways, we're gonna play Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[04:41.82]I figured it's a just chill game to relax and hang out and play for a few hours, while then I figure out how I'm gonna get this whole thing put together for Christmas Eve.
[04:52.72]So, let's just get over there.
[04:54.78]What do you say?
[04:58.91]I'm gonna pull that up.
[05:00.71]It should already be captured.
[05:05.05]Hey, I think it is.
[05:07.05]This is not Shrek.
[05:08.11]I didn't say we were going to play Shrek immediately.
[05:12.41]I never said that Shrek was going to be played immediately.
[05:15.89]Shrek is... Why the fuck did I say that last night?
[05:21.35]Why did I say I was going to play Shrek last night?
[05:25.73]The one where explicitly he talks about a certain thing, a certain sexual...
[05:36.73]thing the first sentence of the game and I'm gonna play that on stream I'm gonna have to like here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna he talked like the first sentence of that game was he was talking about like oh yeah I'm gonna like put on a jacket yeah and it's cold outside I'm gonna I'm gonna put on a jacket
[06:00.15]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[06:01.19]Don't pretend like you don't.
[06:02.41]Alright, work assignment.
[06:04.29]Split screen, solo.
[06:05.49]Let's just do solo.
[06:08.73]Alone and scared.
[06:09.71]I played this game years ago.
[06:11.30]A long time ago.
[06:13.30]So long ago.
[06:15.88]Clean up speed run.
[06:20.84]Work site.
[06:21.72]Holy shit.
[06:22.94]I think there was only one place to clean up.
[06:32.32]Uh, save fi- I don't have a restore.
[06:34.40]Alright.
[06:35.36]Game rules.
[06:36.88]Disable Sniffer.
[06:41.18]Time limit and footprint limit.
[06:44.79]Alright, I think that's fine.
[06:47.15]I've just listed Athena's Wrath.
[06:50.27]Average length 1 hour and 30 minutes.
[06:55.51]Holy shit, these take a long time.
[06:57.91]Three hours?
[07:04.36]Wow, okay.
[07:08.51]Aw, average stream length, hour and thirty minutes.
[07:13.97]Play the Christmas map.
[07:15.31]Uh, I have it purchased.
[07:17.13]But I think I might need to open it.
[07:19.38]Right?
[07:24.18]I always found myself much slower than the average time.
[07:26.56]It's gonna be five hours.
[07:28.48]Aw, shit.
[07:34.53]Shrek.
[07:34.95]Shrek is walking.
[07:36.33]Shadow Warrior map.

[09:36.63]Uh... Controls.

[10:29.22]That's not how you pick people up.
[10:30.56]That's not how you pick people up.
[10:35.49]Okay.
[10:36.07]Now what do I do with him?
[10:45.13]What is this?
[10:48.38]How do I, like, use items?

[11:50.65]So I need to, like, I need to know how to, like, even play the game.
[11:56.63]Is there no tutorial?
[12:00.23]I closed the fucking game.
[12:01.25]It's alright.
[12:03.99]You just clean up?
[12:07.44]Why is everybody telling me to do the... Is there even a tutorial?
[12:14.78]Clean up this one.
[12:15.80]You just clean.
[12:21.40]That's it?
[12:21.88]But there's no other thing?
[12:23.54]There's no mechanics that I need to know?
[12:25.61]You just clean.
[12:28.19]Is there no tutorial?
[12:34.09]There isn't a tutorial.
[12:36.23]There's no tutorial.
[12:37.31]Why did everybody tell me to play the tutorial?
[12:43.57]Dude, just clean.
[12:47.69]Oh, fucking goddammit.
[12:49.05]Alright, whatever.
[12:49.81]Here we go.
[12:50.21]I'm ready.
[12:55.52]Alright, game rules, these are fine.
[12:57.20]Alright.
[13:03.04]This is an easy game to flip.
[13:04.32]I know, but I don't know how, at least like, at least five Wadden guys told me to do the tutorial.
[13:09.97]Alright, I got it.
[13:20.57]Okay, now I'm on fire.
[13:28.99]I need to get a bucket of water.
[13:30.15]This shit is so dirty now.
[13:34.05]Where's the water?
[13:39.77]I need a bucket of water.
[13:40.90]Where do I get a bucket of water?
[13:46.58]What is this?
[13:47.06]Alright, I gotta find water.
[13:57.28]Do I have, like, a wa- can I, like, order it from my fucking menu?
[13:59.98]What the fuck is this?
[14:03.06]Why do I have, like, a ghost detector?
[14:07.22]Oh, okay.
[14:07.84]The Slosh-o-matic.
[14:08.76]Oh, there we go, bucket of water.
[14:15.23]So now I go like this.
[14:17.19]Look at that.
[14:19.69]Oh my lord.
[14:29.29]Alright, I get it now.
[14:30.43]I get it.
[14:30.75]I remember.
[14:32.09]What do I do with the bodies?
[14:40.83]Is there something I need to do with the bodies?
[14:43.37]Do I actually have to burn them?
[14:44.75]I have to burn them.
[14:53.70]Are you sure?
[14:54.18]I feel like that's wrong.
[15:00.60]Hey, fuck this Xbox!
[15:06.38]I think I- oh, I blocked the door.
[15:07.55]Oof.
[15:14.69]Alright, what do I do?
[15:22.76]Ah, it's too bloody.
[15:23.64]I need more water.
[15:24.52]Does this work more?
[15:28.86]Does it work faster?
[15:33.70]Alright, come here.
[15:34.56]Put you over here.
[15:35.18]I feel like you guys are just making me do that, and I'm not supposed to be doing that.
[15:40.18]Did I just put everything in the fire?
[15:43.06]Okay, everything can go in the fire.
[15:49.09]That's how you clean the whole house.
[15:56.49]Okay.
[15:57.87]Uh, this is dirty.
[16:02.01]What do you do with the dirty shit?
[16:08.50]Okay.
[16:09.76]I need another one.
[16:16.15]Alright, get out here.
[16:21.69]Oh, I knocked it over.
[16:22.39]No, I want to get... Alright.
[16:34.85]Come here.
[16:36.25]Right here.
[16:39.55]Now it's clean.
[16:40.31]Now- I'm tracking footprints everywhere.
[16:42.57]Is this why everyone told me to turn it off?
[16:45.65]How do I clean my feet?
[16:48.97]How do I cl- Okay.
[16:56.13]Alright, I got it.
[16:58.15]Clean the- Okay.
[17:10.57]Wait, what's that?
[17:11.51]What do I do with these?
[17:15.53]Can I get a waste basket?
[17:19.21]How do I get a trash can?
[17:33.01]This is a trash can.
[17:34.57]Don't tell me it's not.
[17:38.01]It just has water in it.
[17:45.23]Okay.
[17:48.87]What is this?
[17:49.89]Ice cold.
[17:54.78]Is this playing music?
[18:00.10]How do I make it change songs?
[18:05.89]How do I make this change music?
[18:33.72]Alright, I need to turn this music off.
[18:35.76]Alright, here we go.
[18:37.71]No, set it on a safe place.
[18:45.05]Is there a- can I rotate something?
[18:46.49]Alright, how do I rotate?
[18:49.93]Alright, how do I press the button?
[18:58.64]E?
[19:00.06]Hold left click.
[19:09.27]The screen.
[19:09.85]Oh, I got it.
[19:14.47]Okay.
[19:21.69]Alright, stop.
[19:22.25]I gotta clean.
[19:29.87]There's a cursor?
[19:37.31]Oh, what the f- this is so tiny!
[19:39.71]I didn't see the cursor!
[19:43.07]I thought I had to press the button with my finger!
[19:50.50]No.
[19:56.74]They all start the same way.
[19:57.70]Alright, whiskey and a shotgun, sure.
[20:00.76]Alright, give me my- where is it?
[20:07.87]Alright, let me... I'm gonna go corner.
[20:09.95]This is how you clean a real house.
[20:11.05]You go corner to corner.
[20:16.10]And you gotta bring the bucket with you.
[20:18.42]So you don't get it anywhere, alright?
[20:20.12]I'm gonna go corner to corner.
[20:21.72]Start in this corner.
[20:27.45]Sorry.
[20:31.09]Make sure it's all clean in one corner.
[20:34.35]Watch your feet.
[20:36.40]This is the tactic, because then you don't step in where you've already cleaned, and you don't have to worry about anything else, so.
[20:50.64]I didn't know you could do that.
[20:55.91]The presents are fine, right?
[20:56.99]I don't have to get- is part of the cleaning- how do I get that?
[21:01.89]How the fuck do I get the guy up on the- on the ceiling?
[21:13.73]Oh god.
[21:18.55]What do you mean, gun?
[21:20.13]What am I supposed to do with a gun?
[21:22.89]I can't use it.
[21:27.46]The FOV?
[21:28.14]It should be 90.
[21:28.68]Let me turn it up.
[21:34.62]95.
[21:35.60]Anything over, like, 100 is puke-inducing.
[21:39.83]Alright, so this corner is done.
[21:43.98]Wait, not quite.
[21:47.74]What's that thing?
[21:51.18]What a load.
[21:51.84]Disposal bins.
[21:53.07]Ooh, wait.
[21:53.63]How do I get one?
[21:59.25]So this is where trash goes.
[22:00.23]Alright, how much... What do I do with this afterwards?
[22:27.39]I have to throw that in the fire afterwards.
[22:28.97]Ah, bullshit.
[22:29.99]No, I don't.
[22:38.00]Okay, make sure... How do I... How do I stand it back up?
[22:47.94]Shift?
[22:48.52]How do I turn it?
[22:49.20]I need to turn this!
[22:56.19]I got it.
[22:56.77]Okay.
[23:02.22]So you can just smash into stuff, I get it.
[23:22.60]Oh, okay, I can hold left click and just turn around, easy.
[23:32.23]Alright, can I get the fuck out of this corner?
[23:34.59]I almost got- okay, remember, the technique is corner to corner.
[23:37.21]I have to be careful.
[23:44.44]Alright, so do I have to put these in here?
[23:46.08]Is that the- do I get more points if I do it like this?
[23:59.01]Fucking footprints.
[24:02.07]There's nothing even in here.
[24:02.81]This is dirty.
[24:11.70]No, it's not.
[24:12.48]What's the- what are the shells coming from?
[24:13.72]Why does this thing have- this thing's on a shotgun.
[24:16.64]Oh, never mind, it fell out before.
[24:17.74]Okay, here we go.
[24:20.45]Don't step in any blood.
[24:21.41]I gotta get to the front.
[24:33.98]This is fun.
[24:34.68]This is kind of like a House Flipper, but you don't flip the house, you just clean it up.
[24:47.76]Oh, this is fun.
[24:48.64]What?
[24:49.40]Was there something wrong with how I said that?
[24:52.10]You don't think this is fun?
[24:52.98]I think this is fun.
[24:58.36]It's fun.
[24:58.70]Can you do my house next?
[25:00.95]I don't even want to answer that, because...
[25:05.62]I don't think I'm good enough.
[25:06.74]You know what I mean?
[25:11.02]I'm not sure you want me there.
[25:13.16]It'll take me, like, six hours to clean one room in your house.
[25:16.66]Alright, what else is in here?
[25:17.45]Alright, well, that's pretty brutal.
[25:21.21]Uh... Happy Christmas, though.
[25:24.41]So these are... That...
[25:36.99]Does it do it?
[25:49.68]How do I call in another janitor?
[25:55.21]Janitor 2!
[26:00.87]Okay, so age 19, the careless work ethic of your predecessor led to their death, shaming the company.
[26:07.28]We require that you as a substitute fill this opening immediately.
[26:13.24]Perform your duties in accordance with the company guidelines and regulations or be replaced.
[26:18.04]Your performance will be evaluated.
[26:19.50]Why would somebody do that?
[26:22.92]How can I just take a fucking live dynamite, throw it into a fire, and... Doesn't work, is my last words.
[26:32.26]Oh, what the fuck.
[26:33.28]Okay, well... Ugh.
[26:40.57]Is that me?
[26:41.21]Ugh.
[26:49.44]Hold on, I wanna like do it again though.
[26:51.63]I'm gonna get a good distance.
[26:55.19]Fuck it, let's go.
[26:57.69]Ready?
[26:59.05]What do I do with it?
[26:59.61]Over here!
[27:01.51]Oh shit!
[27:07.89]What was that?!
[27:09.01]There was another explosion!
[27:10.83]Oh no!
[27:11.75]What?!
[27:16.88]What was the other explosion?
[27:21.99]No!
[27:25.51]What was the other explosion?
[27:26.91]This is... This is... This is cleaning up.
[27:45.86]Haven't even seen Game of Thrones.
[27:47.62]Fire!
[27:48.80]Oh fuck!
[27:53.37]This is the... I'm cleaning.
[28:02.32]Give it to me, I want it.
[28:12.84]Okay, so I did it.
[28:16.84]So now I have to restart the level.
[28:22.45]Do I have to restart the level?
[28:27.08]Yup.
[28:31.06]Yes.
[28:31.68]No.
[28:32.54]I could clean it, though.
[28:34.78]Ow.
[28:37.94]Oh, shit.
[28:38.68]That went through his head.
[28:40.79]I can clean this up.
[28:49.57]Look, I have to clean it up anyways.
[28:54.87]Oh, what a funny explosion stream.
[28:57.71]No, now that's over.
[29:00.77]Alright, I'm gonna, no.
[29:01.79]No, I don't get to go back.
[29:07.08]Did you see that funny explosion?
[29:08.68]Okay.
[29:14.44]Let's, like all cleaning techniques, you gotta start in the corner.
[29:22.38]Okay.
[29:24.04]Give me this.
[29:31.81]I need a mop up here.
[29:39.29]Two hours average.
[29:41.17]I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
[29:42.81]I want to play this game again.
[29:44.37]This is- I like this game.
[29:45.93]I didn't even give it a real chance before, but what if- this is fun.
[29:51.30]I feel like I'm accompli- What is this?
[30:00.55]Oh my god, that's... this is terrible.
[30:02.97]This is actually fucking awful.
[30:07.31]Ugh.
[30:15.16]I'll get in there.
[30:21.92]Okay.
[30:23.44]Uh...
[30:44.74]Okay, that's fine.
[30:47.38]Let me take care of this first.
[31:03.03]Then I'm gonna dump this in the... So this is kind of like bagging leaves, right?
[31:09.33]Don't tip it over!
[31:10.33]I want the arms.
[31:13.32]Then you go dump the leaves where... Is that a person inside?
[31:18.42]It is.
[31:21.50]Tip joke incoming.
[31:22.82]No, it is not.
[31:30.38]I need to get it all concentrated in the same place, and then I can deal with it.
[31:36.56]So that's it.
[31:37.08]No, there's a couple more pieces in here.
[31:44.20]Come on, get it.
[31:44.66]Is there like a crouch?
[31:51.03]What the hell?
[31:53.61]Well, I... Incoming spill.
[31:59.97]No, I'm getting them in a concentrated location because then I can dump them.
[32:13.16]Because I don't want to have to come back up here for bodies.
[32:15.76]Right?
[32:16.14]So... Only one more?
[32:18.88]Alright, this is the last body here.
[32:30.38]Alright.
[32:31.33]Here we go.
[32:35.69]Is this too heavy?
[32:40.65]Slow, slow, slow.
[32:45.79]What the fuck did I just walk over?
[32:47.43]I don't even know what happened.
[32:48.15]I went over a speed bump.
[32:55.89]I can't see.
[32:56.51]Am I going the right way?
[32:58.50]Yes.
[33:02.84]What is going on?
[33:04.16]Okay.
[33:12.43]Alright, get him over there.
[33:18.24]There are too many in here, it's alright.
[33:35.43]Come on, get out!
[33:36.77]Get out!
[33:37.17]Yeah, it's like dumping a recycling bin.
[33:44.52]Okay.
[34:00.06]Burn the box.
[34:05.44]Should I have done that?
[34:07.22]Put out a new song.
[34:12.52]With the stuff in it.
[34:14.79]Well, whatever, it's fine.
[34:16.45]Okay, so now I'm gonna get a clean bucket.
[34:24.66]And that's gonna go up here, and then I'm gonna start the actual, this is gonna be completely clean.
[34:31.32]Oh, I forgot a guy over there, whatever.
[34:34.98]Read the notes on Santa's desk.
[34:39.24]What about the flash drives?
[34:44.79]I need another, uh... This is gonna take forever.
[34:50.85]No, it's not.
[34:53.89]How about this?
[34:55.02]I'm not going to turn the stream off until this is clean.
[35:01.72]You understand?
[35:02.16]This is going to be a short stream.
[35:04.62]But, I don't know.
[35:06.86]It might be longer than that now.
[35:11.72]Okay, I've got to get the blood up there.
[35:16.33]I've got to make this orderly, too.
[35:19.93]Alright, this is dirty.
[35:23.01]I gotta get rid of this.
[35:31.09]I can put it back here, right?
[35:32.13]And then... What came?
[35:38.85]What is that?
[35:39.63]Why did an arm come out?
[35:46.60]Do I just burn these?
[35:54.88]You just burn everything.
[35:56.28]I thought I could put it up there and exchange it for a new one.
[36:02.71]Okay, that's fine.
[36:05.01]I'll deal with that one later.
[36:06.01]Nah, footprints.
[36:16.85]Okay.
[36:24.93]It's so dirty up here.
[36:25.87]Alright, now let's... Let's go past the... I am Brute, right?
[36:46.80]Nobody... Come on, what?
[36:48.62]Everybody hated that one?
[36:51.34]Very funny.
[36:52.34]Nobody liked that one.
[36:53.36]Nobody thought that was funny.
[36:55.27]Fine, I'm never making another joke ever again.
[37:03.13]I don't know what that guy... I think that guy clicked through the wall.
[37:13.75]Can he honestly not see the USB sticks?
[37:15.93]Yeah, but what am I... So?
[37:18.73]What about them?
[37:19.21]What do you want me to do with these?
[37:27.71]I don't know, what do you want me to do with them?
[37:28.99]Everyone's saying, USB, USB!
[37:30.45]Is there a computer?
[37:51.09]Like, this thing?
[37:52.39]Is this a computer?
[38:00.39]Please swipe your card and pull the crank.
[38:02.03]Do not put gum... Okay.
[38:09.16]Oh.
[38:11.50]Okay, activate.
[38:17.66]Has your janitorial work here met the requirements of the company?
[38:20.12]Uh... No, I'm not done yet.
[38:27.18]I was just checking the machine.
[38:30.58]I wish I could do more for my company.
[38:31.92]Give me some paperwork to fill over extra marks.
[38:35.46]No, I'm just checking out the machine.
[38:37.44]So how do I get that to work?
[38:38.96]I just put it in.
[38:43.79]It disappeared?
[38:46.63]I did.
[38:46.91]Oh.
[38:47.13]Oh, okay.
[38:51.71]Can I pick this up?
[39:06.11]Okay.
[39:09.61]What was I doing?
[39:10.47]Oh yeah, up here.
[39:24.78]Alright, the top is going to be done very, very shortly.
[39:26.86]I just need to rearrange.

[40:16.54]And I want to fucking... No, no, no!
[40:17.70]Okay, I gotta get back to the police!
[40:22.27]Oh, thank God!
[40:22.97]Okay.

[41:54.88]I gotta put the presents back up on the table.
[42:00.63]Because, actually, no, no, this is dirty.
[42:04.35]So, let me ask this one more time.

[44:11.56]All the blood is gone.
[44:12.42]Is there any blood underneath?
[44:17.21]I don't think there is.
[44:18.03]There's a little bit.
[44:20.17]Is that blood?
[44:20.87]No, it's a shadow from the gun.
[44:22.05]Okay.
[44:23.67]Not bad.
[44:24.57]Wait.
[44:35.52]Okay.
[44:36.76]Take a look at that.
[44:38.27]Nice and clean.
[44:40.09]We just need to take this stuff down here to throw it in the fire trash.
[44:53.65]Use the sniffer.
[45:01.69]What is this thing trying to tell me?
[45:07.49]Uh, what does it mean?
[45:45.52]I mean, is there... I need the wood planks to go over that hole.
[45:53.35]Are you sure?
[45:56.13]Is it the guns?
[45:59.58]Hold on, I want to test something here.
[46:10.53]It is the gun!
[46:19.48]It's detecting all the blood below me.
[46:21.76]Okay.
[46:22.18]No, no, no.
[46:22.68]We're fine.
[46:24.42]Is blood on the ceiling?
[46:32.39]Put it... I'm not even going to say what you just said.
[46:35.07]Alright, this is done.
[46:41.81]What is that?
[46:43.25]Oh.
[46:46.00]Alright, I want to make sure I don't track any steps.
[46:52.25]Come here.
[46:57.41]One detects blood and gore, the other detects trash.
[46:59.41]Okay.
[47:00.46]I feel like I kind of need to get close to being clean.
[47:03.68]Because, I mean, I will... Hmm, what?
[47:05.88]Are you detecting anything in the room?
[47:08.66]So I need to clean this up first, and then walk around with the ectoplasm gun.
[47:16.41]This is dirty.
[47:29.50]People are asking why am I doing... Wait, does that work?
[47:34.40]Hold on a second.
[47:37.30]Does that work?
[47:46.57]No, it doesn't.
[47:58.21]Get- What are you giving me?
[48:00.33]I don't want this.
[48:02.39]Why is it cooking food for me?
[48:03.83]I don't want like a fucking filet mignon.
[48:05.43]Give me a- What are you giving these to me for?
[48:08.17]Why is this here?
[48:09.64]No!
[48:20.95]Why did it spawn di- This is the water hole.
[48:25.09]What?
[48:34.81]That's- I'm supposed to get water buckets out of that thing.
[48:41.74]What the fuck?
[48:44.24]Put the dynamite in the water.
[48:45.30]I didn't have any buckets of water!
[48:46.50]That's why I was calling for them, and I thought you could dump the buckets of water onto the ground to make the ground clean.
[48:52.74]Alright, the careless of the genitor four, the careless work ethic of your predecessor led to their death.
[48:57.85]Yeah, it's a shame.
[48:59.25]Okay.
[49:05.48]Let's hope I don't get a fucking other dynamite in the water machine.
[49:10.46]No, just more fucking stakes.
[49:17.22]Why are you doing this?
[49:23.95]Can I get a bucket of fucking water?
[49:25.77]Alright.
[49:31.23]Get off!
[49:33.77]No, I don't want more water!
[49:38.07]Give me!
[49:46.10]Okay.
[49:52.50]Looks pretty good so far.
[49:53.74]Get this shit out of here.
[49:58.36]My computer's like, running.
[49:59.46]Oh, I need that, I need that!
[50:00.34]This is how you get extra points, right?
[50:16.29]Two steps forward.
[50:17.86]What?
[50:18.12]There was no blood in there.
[50:19.24]I was gonna say two steps forward, ten steps backwards.
[50:24.90]Speaking of steps... Ruining everything.
[50:34.74]Can I like throw this in the air?
[50:48.08]Oh, it smashed!
[50:51.60]All that needs to happen is I need to get real close to pick this up, and the hand has to fucking grab me.
[50:59.62]I don't think I'm getting this, ever.
[51:04.05]No, yes I am.
[51:12.23]Just clear the stairs off.
[51:19.94]Alright.
[51:22.40]More water, please.
[51:25.27]Oh, you like your brain matter?
[51:29.01]Water.
[51:36.15]What the fuck is going on?
[51:38.09]How do you even produce this?
[51:42.23]No, now I just dirtied the water.
[51:43.71]Fuck!
[51:49.29]Am I doing something wrong?
[51:54.16]Finally.
[51:58.00]The machine is dirty.
[51:59.66]Well, how would that explain why there's dynamite in the machine?
[52:03.10]Fucking god damn it.
[52:05.03]It's fine.
[52:05.55]There's still water.
[52:15.35]Yeah, that machine's real dirty.
[52:17.07]That's why it's spawning... DYNAMITE.
[52:19.55]Alright, here we go.
[52:28.11]Oh, this is really dirty.
[52:29.02]Ooh, this is- oh, this is DIRTY.
[52:40.08]Any blood on the ceiling?
[52:42.82]It's not spawning dynamite, what am I talking about?
[52:46.42]You didn't see the explosion?
[52:47.70]Alright, upstairs is done.
[52:54.66]It only took, like, two hours.
[53:04.37]Not the ceiling.
[53:05.21]Oh, fuck.
[53:08.21]Goddammit.
[53:11.76]Okay.
[53:12.86]Make sure- I think I got it all.
[53:24.53]What the hell is this?
[53:25.06]This is trash.
[53:25.74]Alright, I gotta get rid of... Ooh, I need that.
[53:45.25]What?
[53:45.51]Alright, so I'm sorry I didn't know that was gonna turn into a fucking Simon Belmont item.
[53:50.32]It's a Castlevania holy water.
[53:52.32]I didn't know that was what was gonna happen.
[53:53.37]I thought it was an LED!
[53:54.37]Alright, the machine is clean.
[54:13.06]Yeah!
[54:16.91]I'm gonna clean the machine.
[54:19.21]And then let's see if your guys' theory is correct.
[54:31.22]Okay, machine is now clean.
[54:38.94]Whatever, fuck.
[54:41.72]Okay, I have a clean machine.
[54:45.44]Now let's see if I get more body parts.
[54:57.05]So it was bullshit.
[54:58.05]Doesn't matter if the machine's dirty or not.
[54:59.77]That wouldn't produce... Why does it keep getting worse?
[55:03.17]Am I getting bad grades or something?
[55:04.65]Okay, back up here.
[55:16.48]This is done.
[55:18.50]No more blood on the ceiling.
[55:20.68]Pick this shit up.
[55:26.96]Yeah.
[55:28.90]Yeah.
[55:32.38]Okay.
[55:36.35]Now I need a new bucket of water.
[55:44.01]I'm sure he didn't want an arm.
[55:49.36]Now, I'm overwhelmed.
[55:51.32]Okay, I'm done.
[55:51.98]That was fun.
[56:01.20]I'm just kidding.
[56:04.72]So, I don't even know where to start.
[56:07.70]I don't know even where to start with this.
[56:09.87]What are all these buckets doing down here?
[56:11.59]I don't know what to do.
[56:15.81]This is so much.
[56:16.77]It's so much that it's overwhelming to me.
[56:19.63]Corner to corner.
[56:20.61]Just like my true strategy.
[56:25.91]Okay.
[56:27.31]Let's do this correct.
[56:28.23]I'm gonna burn the buckets.
[56:34.64]We're starting from scratch.
[56:36.34]I don't even care what that is.
[56:39.54]It's in my way.
[56:41.11]Fuck the stools.
[56:42.61]I just need space.
[56:46.89]Get over here.
[56:48.63]No!
[56:48.89]I need that.
[56:53.51]Nice.
[57:00.57]There's too many things in there.
[57:05.16]All presents are gonna have to move into a corner.
[57:06.98]There's a radio.
[57:14.28]Yeah, I got it right here.
[57:23.55]Okay.
[57:24.45]No, there's more buckets.
[57:26.27]Can I, like, put these in here?
[57:32.27]What happened?
[57:44.98]Oh, alright, I get it.
[57:45.90]I can't... So what happens if this goes back in there?
[57:50.72]Let me just... I'm testing something.
[57:51.82]Hold on.
[58:01.29]Does this take the trash?
[58:03.71]As well.
[58:18.12]Okay.
[58:19.38]You have to burn it.
[58:20.16]I didn't know if you could fill it and then bring it over there and it's like, oh, thank you!
[58:27.42]It sucks it back up and empties it without having to dump it into the fire.
[58:33.39]Okay, here we go.
[58:33.89]Is this new?
[58:41.93]He's trying to telefrag himself.
[58:47.06]I mean, not really.
[58:47.84]I didn't know if there was a quicker way to, instead of dumping it into the fire.
[58:55.75]Corner to corner, let's go.
[58:59.25]I do need that, though, now.
[59:04.55]So, I don't even care what it is.
[59:06.03]I'm not... If it's a present, who gives a shit?
[59:08.15]It's going into the trash.
[59:15.63]What the fuck?
[59:16.58]Well, that has to go up there.
[59:19.36]Perfect.
[59:19.72]Stop this.
[59:26.10]This is... Oh my god, damn it!
[59:31.77]Nothing fell out.
[59:35.99]It's so easy just to accidentally... This is just... Look at this physics thing in the game.
[59:42.73]What is this stuck on?
[59:44.68]On the hat?
[59:49.47]It's flat, man.
[59:51.23]What am I sitting this on?
[59:52.31]What's wrong with this?
[59:53.81]A bullet.
[59:58.14]Alright, more body parts.
[60:08.34]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[60:09.14]It gets caught up in the crosshairs.
[60:10.46]I don't care if it's a nice candy cane.
[60:14.28]It's going in the trash.
[60:16.97]It's not my job to have to worry about what can or can't be thrown away right now.
[60:28.74]What the fuck is this thing?
[60:29.78]Alright, body parts, in.
[60:40.27]In.
[60:42.58]In.
[60:43.54]Alright, we're pretty- we're kinda full.
[61:03.47]Alright, I got it.
[61:09.48]So, do I leave that in there?
[61:10.58]Or do I... I don't understand.
[61:13.46]Do I leave the incinerator in there, or do I have to take it back out?
[61:18.31]Just leave it in there.
[61:19.03]Okay, I didn't know if I was... Alright, that's fine.
[61:23.27]I need another one.
[61:34.70]Alright, now I need a bucket of water.
[61:36.62]Look at that.
[61:39.84]You didn't think I was going to get anything done today, did you?
[61:52.39]Zero progress?
[61:53.71]Look at upstairs!
[61:54.43]I did all of upstairs already.
[61:57.55]I took care of upstairs.
[61:59.51]I got started down here.
[62:02.89]This is how long it would take me to clean an actual house.
[62:08.58]Here's where I'm gonna store all the flash drives, over here in this corner.
[62:20.75]One small part of the map in an hour.
[62:22.43]There's not much left.
[62:33.30]Fucking footprints.
[62:36.49]I need more water.
[62:37.25]Alright, I need to... How do I reliably dump this?
[62:40.63]In the fire?
[62:41.15]I think... Yeah, I have to just put it in the fire.
[62:45.69]I can't do anything else with it.
[62:46.69]Alright, now I've got a flow.
[63:00.78]Now I got a fucking flow.
[63:07.29]This downstairs here is gonna be a breeze.
[63:12.39]Alright, what time is it right now?
[63:13.11]I've been streaming for an hour and four minutes.
[63:15.97]I guarantee, I 100% guarantee that this area down here will be immaculate in exactly 20 minutes.
[63:28.84]Okay?
[63:30.50]So at exactly one hour and 24 minutes into the stream, it's going to be immaculate down here.
[63:36.55]Go!
[63:47.66]Check this out.
[63:51.01]I got a fucking better idea.
[63:52.23]I know what I'm gonna do.
[63:54.47]Watch this.
[64:01.66]I need like five of these.
[64:20.25]Okay, that's good for now.
[64:23.09]One more.
[64:26.44]Here we go.
[64:55.75]I still got it, it's fine.
[65:03.31]Nice spill joke.
[65:05.03]No, not everything is a spill joke!
[65:21.64]Time check.
[65:29.80]I don't need that other one, it's fine.
[65:32.84]I got- I- It's only been two minutes!
[65:35.52]Relax, I got this.
[65:51.01]Ten minutes left.
[65:52.41]No, I have, like, seventeen minutes left.
[66:01.19]Alright, bring this closer.
[66:02.09]Don't waste any time with the incinerator thing.
[66:14.02]There's no reason for it.
[66:14.96]Okay, Candy Cane, get in there.
[66:17.64]All things must go.
[66:30.88]Once the blood is gone, it's just a matter of getting three incinerators.
[66:38.74]What?
[66:42.98]This is dirt.
[66:43.94]Okay.
[66:45.06]Getting there.
[66:45.50]I'm not gonna lie, I would probably sit here with my mouth open and play like the ten hour long level.
[67:01.20]I really would.
[67:04.10]Is it too early to call this game of the year?
[67:06.07]No, no, not too early.
[67:09.23]It's fucking two weeks, the year's over.
[67:12.79]You know what I mean though, is it too... When did this come out?
[67:16.41]Like five years ago?
[67:28.42]I'm a couple of years too late.
[67:30.46]Well, can I amend my taxes from two years ago and make sure that I put Game of the Year 2015 as Viscera Cleanup Detail?
[67:41.22]Because I put that on my taxes.
[67:51.51]Yeah, that one was on purpose because I thought it was funny.
[67:59.43]That's this guy gonna shoot?
[68:00.27]Does the gun shoot if it's in there?
[68:02.41]Is this like a cartoon?
[68:03.31]This is like a cartoon.
[68:04.13]That's gonna go like, right?
[68:09.90]Okay, no, it's not.
[68:24.05]Where was the blood?
[68:24.77]Where did the blood come from?
[68:38.07]Get rid of the oil.
[68:49.61]How am I gonna get that?
[68:51.63]Okay.
[68:53.11]Good.
[68:53.91]Clean.
[68:54.85]No blood.
[68:55.25]Little bit of blood.
[69:03.42]Alright, almost there.
[69:06.39]What do I got?
[69:07.09]I got about 14 minutes.
[69:12.71]Oh dear.
[69:22.26]Not gonna track this around.
[69:32.30]I don't care.
[69:34.20]I don't care.
[69:36.12]I need to bring this over here.
[69:54.33]Come here, get over here!
[70:00.71]No, I forgot there was that much shit in it.
[70:02.41]It's alright, I got 14 minutes.
[70:15.99]What the fuck it was on the table?
[70:17.95]It was a perfect shot.
[70:19.75]Perfect shot.
[70:21.49]Oh, am I mad?
[70:28.87]Just get the furniture out of the way temporarily.
[70:34.05]I can set this up later.
[70:35.75]It just gets in the way.
[70:36.43]It makes me trip.
[70:41.97]Holy shit, those...
[70:48.32]Okay.
[71:21.80]Okay, ground is almost clear.
[71:26.43]Okay, ground, I just gotta run around.
[71:28.55]There's stuff in here!
[71:37.31]Okay, sit right here.
[71:43.62]Oh no, there's so many things.
[71:45.58]Oh no.
[71:46.84]Okay, just the floor has to be clean for the challenge to work.
[72:00.79]Okay, go.
[72:07.33]These footprints are killing me.
[72:08.57]Let's get rid of the large debris.
[72:23.92]There's a lot of it over here.
[72:24.84]I need another one of those.
[72:26.12]Give me another one.
[72:29.38]Hurry!
[72:29.86]Hurry!
[72:31.06]Hurry!
[72:31.64]Why am I saying it like that?
[72:32.66]Hurry!
[72:33.70]Hurry!
[72:34.40]What accent is that?
[72:35.70]Hurry!
[72:42.03]What's hurry?
[72:50.73]Slow down.
[72:51.25]I got plenty of... I have plenty of, like, four minutes.
[72:55.16]No, I have way more than that.
[73:03.12]I have like, yeah, I have 10 minutes.
[73:09.89]Come on, hurry!
[73:10.57]Okay, is there any more debris?
[73:24.76]There's lots of debris.
[73:29.18]What am I talking about?
[73:29.80]This is all from the explosion.
[73:30.90]This is not even my fault.
[73:36.99]I think that's it.
[73:38.31]Any more random debris?
[73:39.33]Yes.
[73:40.19]Random arms that came out.
[73:43.81]Well, this got dumped.
[73:46.23]You gotta move out of the way, man.
[73:48.37]All of you.
[73:52.47]Because I got more things to dump.
[73:57.62]Okay.
[73:59.24]Just get it in the trash.
[74:00.06]Who cares?
[74:11.84]Two buckets.
[74:12.34]That's the third one.
[74:13.12]Just put it here.
[74:16.17]It looks like I just started.
[74:19.17]Well, I can assure you I didn't just start.
[74:21.11]Alright, that's enough.
[74:23.55]There's only a couple more things.
[74:25.37]And then I gotta just furiously mop.
[74:28.84]Dump it.
[74:29.50]Wait.
[74:34.76]Wait.
[74:42.16]What is happening?
[74:42.84]Do I have a clean shot?
[74:53.11]Oh!
[74:55.06]Got it.
[74:55.56]Okay.
[74:57.22]What's next?
[74:57.58]What's next?
[74:57.90]What do I do now?
[75:02.56]Where did this come from?
[75:03.46]What?
[75:03.82]Was it in the...
[75:08.95]Come on, I fucking guaranteed.
[75:11.25]I guaranteed.
[75:12.57]I have to, it has to be done.
[75:21.95]No, I gotta, I gotta place these.
[75:23.41]These have to be placed strategically.
[75:28.78]One here, one in the corner, one here.
[75:33.48]Here we go.
[75:34.98]One, two, three, action.
[75:59.24]Come on.
[76:14.75]See the strategic triangle that I made?
[76:19.55]I'm never away.
[76:21.11]Never five feet away.
[76:44.69]Okay, let's go.
[76:45.57]Let's go.
[76:45.95]Let's go.
[76:46.98]Let's go!
[76:47.36]I'm fucking amped up right now.
[76:52.96]I had two sips of a Red Bull earlier.
[77:15.27]Right here, come on, come on!
[77:31.99]Dick!
[77:32.17]You dickhead! Dickhead.
[77:34.61]Not everybody's a dickhead.
[77:35.73]Fuck you, game!
[77:38.07]I'm- ooooooh. Look- come on, back into it.
[77:48.21]I need... It all got... It went to hell when I fucking... There's so much shit over here.
[77:56.60]No, watch my... Watch it, watch it, watch it.
[77:59.92]Watch my... Watch my pads.
[78:01.44]My pads are getting on the ground.
[78:06.46]I can still do it.
[78:07.08]It's still close.
[78:07.62]Here we go.
[78:08.97]Corner.
[78:11.93]I'll clean it up.
[78:12.41]I just gotta get the shit in here.
[78:22.13]Get in.
[78:24.23]Give it a little shake sometimes.
[78:25.65]I didn't put him in?
[78:27.39]How did you not get... Oh my fucking god, give me a break.
[78:50.72]Fuck the presents.
[78:51.30]They're not necessary.
[78:53.10]Just get rid of them.
[78:53.64]Who cares?
[78:57.99]It's taking longer to fill this than to... Come on.
[79:02.45]How much time?
[79:03.07]I have four minutes.
[79:09.80]I can't even put the fucking presents in there.
[79:42.73]It's gonna be close.
[79:43.37]Alright, any more stray stuff around here?
[79:53.28]Don't you dare fuck that up.
[79:54.42]Okay, come on.
[80:01.90]It's so dirty over here.
[80:28.00]Alright, what's the feat?
[80:44.57]Good.
[80:45.83]Okay, we're almost done.
[80:47.29]What's left?
[80:57.98]What?
[80:59.58]Two minutes!
[80:59.98]Hehehehe!
[81:51.57]Oh no, there's too many.
[81:54.87]I need one of those incinerators.
[81:55.97]Come here.
[82:02.57]Don't step in the blood.
[82:03.41]Oh, I got like 30 seconds.
[82:28.63]It's gonna be clean.
[82:29.65]It'll be clean, but there'll still be some debris.
[82:32.71]But it'll be clean.
[82:33.37]There won't be bodies.
[82:34.79]And there won't be blood.
[82:37.82]20 seconds.
[82:38.16]Okay, what else?
[82:38.96]Any body parts?
[82:39.82]Okay, hold on.
[82:56.22]Alright, wait.
[82:56.76]10 seconds.
[82:57.86]10 seconds!
[82:59.49]10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
[83:08.55]Yeah.
[83:18.93]Fuck you, game!
[83:20.47]Bullshit!
[83:21.12]I'm so pissed off.
[83:22.14]I had it.
[83:22.54]It was close.
[83:27.72]I love this game.
[83:28.40]I'm having so much fun.
[83:30.90]Okay, it was clean.
[83:32.03]Look at how clean it was.
[83:33.51]Before I fucking panic.
[83:39.73]That's pretty close.
[83:41.47]Let's get a bird's eye view.
[83:50.14]Come on.
[83:50.94]Forget about... See, that one right there.
[83:52.74]That one right there.
[83:54.08]That one down there.
[83:55.56]They weren't there.
[83:56.08]I had the presents stacked.
[83:57.80]I just... I knocked over the bucket.
[83:59.16]That was pretty clean.
[84:08.37]Now I can slow down.
[84:14.75]I did the whole thing in almost 20 minutes.
[84:16.59]Come on.
[84:17.37]I'm not gonna get at least one bog jam.
[84:26.00]You guaranteed.
[84:27.38]And I did do it.
[84:28.20]I did clean it, but I... So when the timer went up, it was clean.
[84:32.24]There was no blood, there was no debris.
[84:34.48]When the timer went up, it was fine.
[84:36.46]But the problem is, after the timer, when it was clean, I didn't tell you it wasn't going to be fucked up after the timer goes up.
[84:42.55]So the timer goes up and I knocked over a couple things after the timer went up, a few pieces of debris, some blood went on the ground.
[84:50.79]Stop burning Christmas presents.
[84:55.92]Shut up, idiot, liar, liar, IDIOT!
[85:03.19]So, why did I hit Blackjack, like, four times in a row?
[85:06.67]With the... The dumb... I was gonna say grenade, dynamite.
[85:18.29]I can't even.
[85:19.44]I can not even handle a simple procedure.
[85:22.88]The timer is up.
[85:37.56]Alright, now I can just slowly take care of the rest, and then we're gonna move on to... I don't know, what do I move on to?
[85:46.72]The spill joke isn't funny, stop doing it.
[85:52.43]I got some really, really bad news for you.
[85:56.71]He's not pretending.
[86:09.38]I just, I'm so, I don't know, I just bump into stuff.
[86:14.90]Going to third person.
[86:18.76]Can you?
[86:19.15]Is there a third person mode?
[86:23.29]I could have set this back up in a proper place, in a nice spot, right here on the table.
[86:40.27]That's good.
[86:42.61]Let's do... Am I cranking it?
[86:49.77]Alright, crank it.
[86:52.61]Alt-F4 is third person.
[86:54.19]Is it?
[86:55.05]Let me try.
[86:57.73]Alt-F4.
[86:59.75]I mean, very clearly, I'm hitting space to make that... Why would I choose space of all things?
[87:16.66]So let me... put these... I'm trying to keep track of these.
[87:20.70]Alright.
[87:29.98]Presence.
[87:30.64]Let's just clean this up.
[87:33.04]Wall, blood, fire, put... What's still in there?
[87:43.91]Stop burning everything!
[87:49.45]I'm not burning everything.
[87:51.75]Just the things that I don't feel like walking 10 feet to my left or right.
[87:55.61]If I have the urge to take a stool and walk it this way, then I will.
[88:10.74]Does that boombox have Doom OST?
[88:13.28]Uh, it does not.
[88:15.00]I'm pretty certain it does not.
[88:20.14]No, put this on a table.
[88:25.64]So I'm just learning right now that if you just left-click, it puts it straight, like, the correct orientation that it was supposed to be.
[88:33.26]Right?
[88:35.32]Well, that took me a long time to figure that out.
[88:42.58]Put on Doom.
[88:44.86]No, I'm not going to cave to put the Doom soundtrack on.
[88:48.27]I'm not going to be the guy that gets pressured to put on Doom soundtrack every three streams.
[88:56.23]I want to do, like... I want to do, like, color coordination.
[89:01.00]Oh, that's... Okay.
[89:03.02]Fucking immaculate is what this will be.
[89:07.38]Do it, vessel.
[89:08.28]No!
[89:09.66]I'm not going to do that.
[89:13.10]I want to put on the songs that I want to listen to, and one of them is this one.
[89:20.53]Look at how nice that looks over here now.
[89:24.25]Scratch that.
[89:25.19]Now look at how nice it looks over here.
[89:28.69]You do it every stream.
[89:31.11]Well, don't you understand?
[89:31.83]I don't want to be... I don't want to do that.
[89:34.81]Come on.
[89:36.73]Don't make me put on the Doom OST.
[89:40.57]I'm gonna have some self-control.
[89:42.21]I'm not gonna do it.
[89:44.33]Just put... I'm not... I don't want to put on that either.
[89:47.31]I don't want to put on the Dancing Grandpa Six Flags song.
[89:52.05]Alright?
[90:02.86]What happened to that guy?
[90:06.02]Dancing... Oh.
[90:07.24]Probably... That guy was supposed to be like a hundred years old.
[90:13.90]That was like 30 years, that was like 15 years ago.
[90:20.23]That's too bad, I wish that guy would come back.
[90:23.75]He was a cool mascot.
[90:30.39]I know it wasn't an actual, it was a guy with like a prosthetic face on.
[90:36.63]Do you think I'm that stupid?
[90:40.14]Do you?
[90:40.98]Do you?
[90:45.66]Do you think?
[90:47.89]What, am I some kind of maniac?
[90:56.83]Alright, look at this mess.
[91:11.26]Spill joke incoming.
[91:12.28]No, that would have been a perfect opportunity.
[91:13.48]You see, if I was like, do you think I'm a fucking idiot?
[91:20.08]Oh, I didn't do it though.
[91:26.16]That was a perfect opportunity for like the YouTube edit right there.
[91:29.80]You know what I'm saying?
[91:33.46]Like, I go on that whole rant, that whole... I'm on it anyway.
[91:37.39]You guys think I'm stupid?
[91:38.69]Oh!
[91:40.03]Cut!
[91:40.79]Next scene.
[91:42.89]Perfect.
[91:53.71]Oh.
[91:58.77]How did this get up here?
[92:04.74]What the fuck?
[92:12.39]He's trying to distract us from the Doom OST, is it working?
[92:29.30]I'm not gonna play the Doom OST.
[92:30.44]You gotta have some variety here.
[92:33.12]Maybe I'll put something else on, but you gotta have a little bit of variety here.
[92:47.58]Katamari.
[92:48.74]We listened to Katamari already.
[92:50.76]More than once.
[92:52.54]Okay, now let's get rid of the buckets that are here.
[93:00.00]Hotline Miami OST.
[93:01.38]We just heard it!
[93:02.20]You just heard the whole thing!
[93:03.71]Two days in a row!
[93:04.51]Alright, give me another... Persona 5 OST.
[93:13.58]No, I don't... I haven't played Persona 5.
[93:15.28]I don't want to listen to the OST.
[93:17.32]It's gonna give away, like, secret characters.
[93:30.75]Stream it for a hundred hours.
[93:33.09]Crypt of the... no, no, no, no.
[93:42.83]SpongeBob.
[93:44.15]Yoshi's Island OST.
[93:45.58]Now that's a good one.
[93:47.04]That's something that I can get behind.
[93:48.30]You know, I can get behind that.
[93:52.04]Are these sounds too loud or is this fine?
[93:58.54]Am I being overpowered by the loud noises?
[94:05.27]Alright, hold on a second.
[94:06.15]I don't want to fuck the... Hold on.
[94:07.71]Let me save the game.
[94:08.49]Because that would be bad if something happened here, right?
[94:15.79]Okay, right there.
[94:23.05]Play the Seinfeld OST.
[94:26.44]Seinfeld doesn't have... What?
[94:27.54]There's like three songs.
[94:37.42]There we go.
[94:37.88]Maybe we get this in the right volume level.
[94:50.85]That's not a bad musical level, I don't think.
[94:53.35]I think it's fine.
[94:57.39]It just needs to be in the background.
[95:00.21]Just something that's just... Okay, hold on.
[95:07.95]Why are we getting ResidentSleepers for this?
[95:18.20]ResidentSleeper?
[95:21.86]I wonder why.
[95:22.46]Is it because you're sleepy?
[95:24.58]I don't get it.
[95:30.07]Alright, there you go.
[95:44.79]What happened to this?
[95:50.14]So comfy.
[95:50.92]Yeah, this is a comfy soundtrack, that's for sure.
[95:56.98]Oh, really?
[95:57.44]Get out of here, you fucking dumb- I- Okay, really?
[96:02.48]I'm trying to get comfy here.
[96:03.76]I don't want this bullshit.
[96:13.79]I can't wait to get the... the song that goes... Okay, bring this over here.
[96:35.79]I'm done with this room, pretty much.
[96:37.63]I do need to reorganize.
[96:42.80]Okay, I'm going to put everything up in the air so I don't accidentally spill joke it.
[96:48.32]That's Yoshi's Island, not Yoshi's Story.
[96:50.83]No, that's Yoshi's... That's where it came from.
[96:54.03]That song came from Yoshi's Island.
[96:55.39]That's the stage select.
[96:58.09]And you'll know because here it comes right now.
[97:04.66]Never mind.
[97:05.70]That's not it.
[97:11.55]Uh, this table's dirty.
[97:12.87]Alright, I gotta make sure that I did not pick, like, a 10-hour version of this one song.
[97:20.82]No, I didn't.
[97:21.26]It's stopping.
[97:21.72]Here we go.
[97:22.46]Here it comes.
[97:22.80]You ready?
[97:26.40]Here it comes.
[97:30.57]Come on, do it.
[97:50.17]Okay, well, this is the ocean level.
[97:53.13]Now this is the title screen.
[97:56.55]The person didn't press start yet, whoever's playing.
[98:04.82]This guy's stuck behind here.
[98:10.02]How am I gonna get this person out of here?
[98:23.76]This is not good.
[98:25.44]Nothing- I can't do anything about that.
[98:27.76]I can't move the shelf.
[98:31.94]Well, whatever, he's- now he's a display, that's fine.
[98:34.18]Okay, let's see.
[98:35.64]Ceiling!
[98:39.70]Oh no, fuck that!
[98:41.30]Chrono Trigger is- the Chrono Trigger OST is going on next.
[98:45.19]Yeah!
[98:54.52]Alright, let's get this back up here.
[99:03.94]Alright.
[99:05.06]Looks good.
[99:09.76]I don't think I see... Alright, now is the opportunity where I can... Let's clean this up.
[99:15.75]Put these chairs back where they belong.
[99:20.79]Get the presents.
[99:22.07]Move them over on this table for now.
[99:29.47]How is this different from the house game you played earlier?
[99:32.26]House Flipper?
[99:33.70]Well, this one is, uh, gruesome, brutal... ...murder scenes that you have to clean up.
[99:38.54]House Flipper is you put up new walls.
[99:40.18]I don't have to put any- I just have to clean.
[99:41.38]That's all I gotta do here.
[99:42.14]Let's go like this.
[99:52.04]Here's the first cutscene.
[99:52.96]I remember this.
[99:56.30]This is when it introduces Super Mario in the diaper.
[100:26.76]How am I gonna get this elf over here?
[100:37.80]Fuck!
[100:38.78]That would've been awesome.
[100:43.25]Finally?
[100:43.69]What do you mean finally?
[100:46.21]Fucking finally!
[100:47.69]Finally he found the elf!
[100:54.63]What is this noise I hear?
[100:57.25]What are these sounds I seek?
[100:59.79]How many people are in the street?
[101:01.39]Oh, that's perfect.
[101:02.35]Fucking here comes the musical intro.
[101:12.36]And like all the actors are fucking running around and like wind is blowing them.
[101:17.38]This is the ensemble intro to any musical you will ever watch.
[101:20.64]It does not matter.
[101:24.20]Just listen, wait for this part.
[102:00.73]Is Jeremy high right now?
[102:02.14]No!
[102:02.58]Alright, I'm gonna relax.
[102:03.66]I think this guy's on drugs.
[102:07.96]He has to be!
[102:13.40]What's this guy on, fuckin' drugs?!
[102:23.69]No, I don't take drugs.
[102:27.13]Well, I mean, I do.
[102:28.44]But ones that are prescribed by a doctor.
[102:39.07]Yeah!
[102:44.26]Oh no, he's gonna explode!
[102:45.61]What do we do?
[102:46.13]Wait.
[103:13.31]Oops.
[103:14.55]Okay, get it.
[103:16.43]Candle.
[103:17.03]Okay.
[103:17.39]Candle.
[103:45.65]Uh...
[104:15.92]I can't, like, transfer it.
[104:22.64]Bring the TNT closer.
[104:26.90]Yeah, but... That's dangerous.
[104:29.46]I gotta go far for that.
[104:42.55]God damn it.
[104:57.99]Ah, no, I just... I can't light it from far away.
[105:08.36]Whatever.
[105:08.80]Welcome to the scene.
[105:10.20]Use the candle.
[105:18.64]Use the candle.
[105:19.12]The candle didn't do anything.
[105:20.58]I almost just said the F word.
[105:21.78]I almost just said the F-U-C-K word.
[105:25.64]Oh, cave level.
[105:26.36]This is cool.
[105:29.17]YouTuber funny moments clip.
[105:31.69]Don't tell me about YouTuber funny moments.
[105:36.80]Have you ever seen... My Modern Warfare 3 video?
[105:45.54]Hysterical.
[105:53.97]Remember?
[105:55.11]Remember when I went... Get the fuck out of here!
[106:05.51]See?
[106:05.75]Oh, look at that.
[106:06.71]Look at all these LOLs.
[106:09.27]Remember that?
[106:13.58]How about this one?
[106:16.02]You stupid fucking idiot!
[106:18.86]Remember that one?
[106:19.60]Whoa.
[106:38.57]I thought my monitor just broke.
[106:40.07]So did I. Alright.
[106:48.99]No more dicking around.
[106:50.11]I can't... One step backwards, two steps forward, three steps backwards.
[106:54.25]That's been this whole entire stream so far.
[106:56.08]Is there somebody in here?
[106:58.86]Oh, there was.
[107:02.48]Whatever.
[107:06.98]The game has text-to-speech chatting.
[107:14.04]Text-to-speech chatting.
[107:18.86]How?
[107:19.32]How do you do it?
[107:20.81]Type in the chat.
[107:30.75]Yeah, that's a Tuber game, Laura.
[107:32.13]That's...
[107:34.51]Type in the chat.
[107:36.21]You have to enable it.
[107:38.69]Oh.
[108:04.68]How do you type?
[108:09.64]Audio shit for brains.
[108:12.04]What, you don't think that would be under controls?
[108:14.62]Like toggling like a contro- What?
[108:19.05]T. Oh, great.
[108:30.19]No, I don't- No, I have T.
[108:38.49]I didn't, what?
[108:41.35]U.S.S.
[108:41.65]Jerma.
[109:17.69]Remember this one, ha ha ha ha, my rock-a-cup-ter switches.
[109:22.14]I remember that one, let's do it every video.
[109:45.10]I'm serious, every single video I'm gonna put that in my funny moments.
[109:51.84]Oh fuck boss fight.
[109:54.92]Jump.
[109:57.66]Egg throw.
[110:00.56]Ooh.
[110:01.68]Toa.
[110:04.40]Got him.
[110:07.70]How many more hits?
[110:08.88]Ooh.
[110:09.66]Ow.
[110:23.14]He's a big, loopy guy with clown pants.
[110:26.58]WTF how does this sound?
[110:31.37]That's my favorite game from SNES.
[110:48.02]Alright, that's enough.
[111:31.57]Say JermaCraft.
[111:34.01]No.
[111:35.81]That's something I'm not going to say.
[111:45.21]JermaCraft.
[112:30.31]Stop, it's not an S. What?
[112:37.56]What are you talking about?
[112:39.00]It's gonna be some foo.
[112:40.56]Alright, the text-to-speech is over.
[112:43.46]I'm turning it off.
[113:00.94]I gotta get out of this fucking room.
[113:02.48]A fucking- Oh, he swears!
[113:07.60]What's wrong with me?
[113:08.28]I don't know.
[113:17.44]No, it's not on there!
[113:18.24]Why do I think it's on there?
[113:21.38]Alright, get me the incinerator thing.
[113:32.05]Give me a new one.
[113:32.77]I want a clean slate.
[113:33.89]I don't even know what's in there.
[113:40.05]This room is done.
[113:42.84]Let me pull out the... the meter.
[114:02.06]Is that it?
[114:07.02]I think it's detecting the shit downstairs.
[114:08.78]He finally noticed the green poop.
[114:22.73]It's called the Sniffer, get the names right.
[114:25.97]Alright, I'm gonna move on.
[114:28.37]This room is pretty much done, I'll figure the rest out later.
[114:31.99]I need a new bucket.
[114:33.49]Let's get rid of the old buckets.
[114:34.95]Wait a minute, that's not a red lamp post.
[114:38.13]Now it is.
[114:45.58]End of the stream voice, not even close.
[115:01.36]Oh my god, why am I doing that?
[115:05.82]I have the memory of a fucking goldfish.
[115:09.69]I'm gonna pick this up and put it over here.
[115:11.89]Okay.
[115:13.03]That thing no longer exists.
[115:20.29]Has it been more than five seconds?
[115:22.13]Item doesn't exist anymore.
[115:26.69]Two will be fine, I think.
[115:40.86]Okay, don't knock that over.
[115:44.38]Two will be alright.
[115:46.31]Now I need to get one of those trash compactors.
[115:54.23]What is this?
[115:56.45]What is this?
[115:57.31]You just... Another boss died.
[116:05.70]Is there bat in that game?
[116:08.38]I don't remember who that was.
[116:10.08]No, it...
[116:40.53]A boomer game.
[116:42.55]How dare you say something like that.
[116:45.53]Yoshi's Island is the history of all video games.
[116:50.80]I need... What do I need?
[117:04.41]There's an achievement that said 28,000 or something.
[117:07.01]I don't even know what it said.
[117:08.31]But that's a lot.
[117:09.05]There's no blood over here.
[117:10.09]This thing's pretty clean over here.
[117:16.75]What the fuck happened in here?
[117:17.75]Did a grenade come in here?
[117:18.99]I think so.
[117:29.85]That's not gonna fit like that.
[117:31.05]I'm gonna have to do individual pieces of wood.
[117:38.58]A grenade walked in here?
[117:40.34]Yeah, so... I mean, like, what the fuck?
[117:45.59]Get out of my space, man.
[117:57.96]I need to get... This is not gonna happen.
[118:01.04]It's too clunky.
[118:04.00]Too clunky.
[118:12.69]Too clunky.
[118:23.20]Ah, how am I gonna get all this out of here?
[118:24.80]I think I have to make another pile.
[118:32.34]No.
[118:32.64]Give me the bucket.
[118:43.26]I think I have an idea.
[118:51.40]It's kind of- that's not a bad idea.
[118:55.79]Just knock it all in the corner over there.
[118:57.27]Alright.
[119:04.79]Now that loosened it up.
[119:05.97]That didn't do anything.
[119:14.28]I need to hydrate.
[119:15.04]It's been two hours.
[119:19.38]I'm alright.
[119:26.96]I already drank a lot of water.
[119:28.21]I'm alright.
[119:29.21]I appreciate the concern.
[119:33.29]Fuck you.
[119:33.85]Did that really just happen?
[119:39.39]Alright, that's mopped up.
[119:41.77]Nothing else in the corner, I don't think.
[119:45.69]Step on the table.
[119:47.95]This water is absolutely filthy.
[119:53.83]Time to get rid of this water.
[119:59.89]Drink, drink, drink.
[120:01.72]Fine.
[120:07.22]There's extra like fucking protein cells in there.
[120:24.46]Here's the bonus room, where you spin the wheel.
[120:26.76]Okay.
[120:41.18]Why do you just have to ruin everything with the beat here?
[120:48.00]Is this clown music?
[120:49.56]I mean it technically is clown music, carnival music.
[120:54.95]Technically.
[120:56.51]Alright, where we at?
[120:57.57]We need... I need to get these stools out of the way.
[121:01.62]No, it's just, it's just brush.
[121:04.38]Pick up the bodies after, just, it's called, you gotta brush.
[121:09.66]Because then I got a clean slate and it's just picking stuff up and moving stuff around.
[121:17.31]Just don't hit the bodies because it spreads blood.
[121:19.83]Like that.
[121:22.37]Debris is fine.
[121:23.13]I can just bop around it.
[121:37.74]Debris.
[121:38.22]Some blood, some more debris.
[121:42.06]Now it's time to actually pick shit up off the ground.
[121:48.27]This is Super Mario Gets the Star.
[121:53.09]I don't know what the fuck it's doing in a Yoshi game.
[121:56.87]Alright, I think I can bring in a barrel.
[122:09.80]Because Yoshi is part of the Mario universe.
[122:13.17]Oh, yeah!
[122:20.11]Nice ad.
[122:25.21]I can't even see the sour please gift.
[122:27.35]Yes, I can.
[122:31.82]I told you, my New Year's resolution is I'm going to download BetterTwitch.TV.
[122:41.76]These are just too big.
[122:42.71]They gotta go by themselves.
[122:44.43]They can't fit in the box.
[122:47.59]But hey, there's the joke, though, guys.
[122:49.53]Because New Year's resolutions, you never do them.
[122:59.56]Alright, I think the rest can fit in a box.
[123:04.32]Yeah.
[123:05.82]Give it to me.
[123:11.99]This is the final boss, right?
[123:18.52]Alright, body parts.
[123:20.42]This is going pretty smooth.
[123:30.69]This old electric guitar song.
[123:33.15]The sounds.
[123:34.49]That like, do-do-do-do-do-dwee-dwee, do-do-do-do-do-do-dwee, dwee-dwee!
[123:51.78]You know how long it probably took somebody to find or make that electric guitar sound?
[124:06.63]Sounds like a Mega Man.
[124:09.63]Well, they are from the same era.
[124:19.52]Not gonna fit, but I will try to balance it.
[124:21.88]They don't have this kind of... You know what I mean?
[124:34.61]Fortnite.
[124:34.99]They don't have this kind of music in Fortnite.
[124:51.79]Why does everything relate back to Fortnite?
[124:57.21]Because I believe at this point there are more followers to the Fortnite Twitter than members of Christianity.
[125:06.70]So, I mean, it's pretty relevant.
[125:22.96]Jesus, Fortnite.
[125:24.48]No, what I'm saying is, Fortnite has become so big.
[125:30.18]It's like Minecraft times five.
[125:43.43]How many followers does the Fortnite Twitter have?
[125:47.75]I'm curious.
[125:49.35]And this is just the Twitter account.
[125:53.64]Six and a half million.
[125:57.47]How many people follow Christianity?
[126:00.09]Like, eight million?
[126:02.05]Four million?
[126:05.93]It's like probably a billion, fuck.
[126:08.81]It's like two billion people.
[126:14.06]Alright.
[126:15.42]Somebody do a Google search.
[126:16.56]Is Fortnite more popular than Christianity?
[126:40.77]Yeah, only 6.5 million people follow the Twitter, but how many people have installed the game?
[126:49.41]Somebody give me some facts on that.
[126:50.75]How many people have installed Fortnite?
[126:53.15]I'm talking across mobile, I'm talking on desktop,
[127:09.05]Over 200 million.
[127:12.57]Okay.
[127:20.99]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[127:21.81]New OST.
[127:22.53]New OST.
[127:22.95]Hold on.
[127:32.74]Chrono Trigger.
[127:34.70]This is a good one.
[127:35.66]This is a really good one.
[127:41.16]One of my favorite games ever made.
[127:42.16]In case you're curious.
[127:58.55]ResidentSleeper on Chrono Trigger?
[128:00.17]What?!
[128:07.27]Chrono Trigger's an awesome game!
[128:13.95]I mean, that's a real quick way to get fired from chat.
[128:32.49]Anime game?
[128:33.95]It's not an anime game.
[128:44.70]It is?
[128:45.06]What do you mean it is?
[128:46.18]Yes, it is.
[128:46.84]No, it is not!
[128:51.11]Just because Toriyama did the fucking slides doesn't mean that it's an anime game.
[129:09.94]Just fuck that.
[129:10.80]I'm taking it up later.
[129:18.14]Alright, I've made no pro- Yeah, I have.
[129:19.70]Look at this.
[129:22.29]Turn it up.
[129:23.53]My pleasure.
[129:37.42]There's some- Oh, no.
[129:38.62]Okay, I thought the game crashed.
[129:40.36]Here's a fun fact about Chrono Trigger, and a stupid, dumb, moronic fact.
[129:46.91]They've re-released this game probably twice the amount, like probably more than Skyrim.
[129:52.19]Just make another one.
[129:54.29]Do it!
[129:55.53]You did, you had, fucking god damn it!
[129:58.57]Just make... Just make another one!
[130:05.54]What's stopping you?
[130:06.70]You know, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, they're such, well, everybody loves them.
[130:11.64]They're like more loved than Final Fantasy VII.
[130:15.89]But let's make Final Fantasy VII three times.
[130:21.05]No, no, no.
[130:21.49]Don't do it.
[130:21.85]There's only been two chrono games.
[130:24.41]Make another Final Fantasy.
[130:26.96]Quick, do it.
[130:27.36]Make 17.
[130:27.72]Oh, my.
[130:27.86]I'm sorry.
[130:44.68]I'm so flustered right now for a fucking Chrono Trigger.
[130:49.87]They had an opportunity.
[130:50.97]They had it trademarked.
[130:53.93]But they were like, no, you know what?
[130:55.77]Oh, it's like, um... Hmm.
[131:01.38]Okay, I moved it over there, so it didn't... Chrono for smash?
[131:10.10]I don't know if that would ever happen.
[131:11.74]Isn't there a bunch of weird legality around the entire Chrono franchise?
[131:15.30]Not like five people tied to its inception, and like that's why it's impossible to do anything with it.
[131:21.09]This thing, this one's fine.
[131:22.41]What's wrong with this one?
[131:23.13]Nothing.
[131:23.71]Whatever.
[131:24.01]They made... Yeah, they made Fortnite instead of Chrono Break.
[131:41.31]Chrono Cross was messy.
[131:44.77]But it was still a great game.
[131:48.63]You wanna know something crazy about Chrono Cross?
[131:50.83]Why that game was so fucking cool?
[131:53.09]There were 40 playable characters.
[131:56.85]I think there were like 45 playable fucking party characters.
[132:02.95]That was just... It didn't suck.
[132:05.11]It didn't suck.
[132:05.53]It was messy.
[132:07.40]It was messy.
[132:08.96]But it didn't suck.
[132:15.38]It really did suck.
[132:18.90]Yeah, but if they had... If Chrono Break tied the whole series together and they made like a... Bring back, like, Chrono.
[132:24.68]Bring back Frog.
[132:25.73]Or, you know, Glenn.
[132:26.99]Spoilers, everybody.
[132:27.87]Sorry.
[132:33.31]Boomer Rose Tinted Glasses?
[132:35.07]No, no, no, no, no.
[132:35.97]Go play Chrono Trigger right now.
[132:38.23]Do it right now.
[132:38.93]Close the spring.
[132:41.58]It's on every platform, don't worry, you'll find it.
[132:43.20]Type in, what platform is Chrono Trigger on for me?
[132:49.80]Chrono Trigger is one of the best games ever made.
[132:52.82]Just do it right now.
[132:53.40]It's gonna take you like 30 or 40 hours to do.
[132:57.50]Put it on your Christmas list, don't worry.
[132:59.27]I just threw this in the... Stream Chrono Trigger?
[133:09.27]No, I can't.
[133:15.17]BoomerStreamer thinks the game he played when he was five is a good game.
[133:17.85]Oh, you guys have no idea.
[133:21.59]You have no idea.
[133:22.53]Come on.
[133:23.01]Are you serious?
[133:26.47]This game is a clad- the story is wonderful.
[133:28.68]It was about time travel.
[133:31.58]And like fucking up the future and fucking up the past.
[133:34.18]It was- oh, it was perfect.
[133:41.68]Anime plot.
[133:42.42]This shit predated anime.
[133:43.94]This was like 1994.
[133:49.34]It predated all those terrible Netflix original animes, guys.
[133:52.92]Come on.
[134:09.72]Oh no, here comes a chat for anime, Netflix.
[134:12.24]I mean, I'm joking, but you know what I mean.
[134:13.93]Yeah, what animes did we have back in like the 60s and 70s?
[134:22.65]We had Speed Racer.
[134:26.10]And then like Dragon Ball was made in like 78.
[134:28.00]And then Chrono Trigger.
[134:36.35]A Pokémon.
[134:38.18]And a Kira came out.
[134:39.38]And that, I mean, that was wild.
[134:47.46]And then Minecraft came out.
[134:48.88]And it changed everything.
[134:54.51]Whoa!
[134:56.65]A new item?
[135:03.31]What is this?
[135:03.65]I don't understand what this does.
[135:04.97]Is this just a better mob?
[135:15.90]This thing sucks.
[135:17.72]Am I using this wrong?
[135:31.90]Broomer.
[135:33.84]I know it's a broom.
[135:35.70]Stop calling me Broomer.
[135:37.58]Did anybody say that or did I just make that up?
[135:40.22]I don't know.
[135:40.98]I'm having a paranoid moment here.
[135:46.74]No one said that.
[135:53.62]Alright, I gotta pay attention, I have- He thinks he's streaming again.
[136:03.45]Jeremy, you gotta wake up, you think you're streaming.
[136:14.78]Compact broomer.
[136:20.52]I'm just so clumsy.
[136:22.08]I don't do this in real life, just because my video game character has like a fat stomach.
[136:26.29]Okay.
[136:27.33]I think this room is pretty much good.
[136:28.91]Just a little bit more cleanup, and we can go down to the basement.
[136:34.51]Wake up, Jeremy.
[136:35.25]It's been five years.
[136:36.31]I mean, I saw you in the other chat doing that a year ago.
[136:39.50]You don't think I've seen you in another chat doing that?
[137:01.37]It's part of the dream.
[137:02.59]That was part of the dream?
[137:07.29]Get out of my fucking way.
[137:15.21]Who's the first person to call me a boomer?
[137:17.58]I really wonder.
[137:20.48]Who started that?
[137:33.26]How many tickets did you guys get when you played this level?
[137:57.95]Max stack.
[137:59.23]Yep.
[138:01.35]Oh!
[138:04.76]Maybe the soundtrack alone will make some of you... No, I'm not gonna keep pushing that.
[138:12.89]I'm not gonna keep pushing like the boomer and millennial thing.
[138:16.17]It's a great game.
[138:17.11]It's got a great soundtrack.
[138:18.79]Made by some of the most brilliant minds that are still making games.
[138:25.10]In the industry.
[138:34.62]Somebody said the soundtrack is very meh.
[138:38.06]I want that person banned for life.
[138:39.10]Yeah, if you don't know what a lifetime ban here is... 10 seconds.
[139:12.46]The Zoombini OST is better than this.
[139:14.94]Okay, is the streamer taking drugs or is the chat member taking drugs?
[139:22.36]I'm not sure.
[139:23.20]No, I am sure.
[139:23.94]I'm not on drugs.
[139:24.82]So let me... You know what?
[139:26.06]I was going with that.
[139:41.14]Oh my god.
[139:42.16]God damn it.
[139:46.73]I don't take any drugs!
[139:51.47]Unless you count, like, Tylenol.
[139:53.77]Or caffeine.
[139:55.75]Sometimes.
[139:58.83]This one was perfect.
[139:59.49]I think it's just music.
[140:09.37]Makes me really productive.
[140:16.29]Jenga!
[140:16.71]This is the magician inside that little tent area.
[140:35.73]Oh no, actually, this is the robot that you have to beat up for tickets.
[140:41.84]I love reminiscing about this game.
[140:45.65]Yeah, it's El Gato.
[140:49.49]I said, it's the robot that you beat up for tickets.
[140:51.29]I know what it is.
[140:52.63]I've played, I've beaten this game 30 times.
[140:55.71]It's for as many years as I've been alive.
[141:05.41]Beat it on stream.
[141:08.43]Maybe I would one day.
[141:09.99]But turn-based RPGs on Twitch... I'm not sure how, uh... I'm not sure how people take that.
[141:25.76]I feel like it's a very... like, you gotta be, like, known for that, right?
[141:30.48]How many of you guys would want to sit through a... me to play a full turn-based 60-hour RPG?
[141:41.48]Really?
[141:41.70]Are you sure?
[141:44.38]Are you guys sure?
[141:44.99]I played Octogeddon for two days and you guys were trying to fucking scream in my face.
[142:10.26]Octogen was fun.
[142:11.62]It was.
[142:12.02]That was a fun little game.
[142:14.30]Alright, I think we're good in here.
[142:22.12]I'll do a final check later.
[142:23.66]See any of the blood?
[142:26.50]Down to the basement we go after I burn.
[142:36.39]If people watch Fortnite, then people will watch anything.
[142:45.80]Yeah, but you understand, like, you guys don't want to watch Fortnite.
[142:50.82]Oh, goddammit, I don't have any water!
[142:55.50]No, not my gifts!
[142:56.50]Oh, come on!
[142:58.19]I just did this room!
[142:59.45]No, what the hell?
[143:10.80]Ugh.
[143:19.17]Completed.
[143:22.49]Are you saying we wouldn't watch you play Fortnite?
[143:24.54]Yeah, maybe it's like a joke for an hour.
[143:29.12]If I turn the stream on tomorrow.
[143:31.40]Uh, hey guys.
[143:32.72]So, I'm going a different direction with the channel here.
[143:34.68]I'm gonna be playing Fortnite three days a week.
[143:36.76]75% of you would leave.
[143:44.69]We've already talked about this.
[143:53.05]You know how many Fortnite channels that already exist?
[143:56.89]What do I bring to the table?
[143:59.24]Whoops, I got a headshot in the very beginning.
[144:01.28]I was player number 97.
[144:02.34]I'm out.
[144:03.02]Let's do that like 35, 40 times.
[144:06.48]I can't believe this happened.
[144:23.75]I'm not gonna be better than everybody that plays.
[144:27.13]I don't, I'm not like, I'm not into BR.
[144:33.03]It doesn't do it for me.
[144:41.78]What, how else am I supposed to abbreviate it?
[144:44.06]BR?
[144:46.76]Royale?
[144:48.14]Battle Royale?
[144:49.60]I guess that's not too hard to say actually, never mind.
[144:56.93]Alright, no more fucking dynamite.
[145:09.26]Come here, come on.
[145:15.88]Alright, good.
[145:17.90]No more dynamite, please.
[145:20.82]Fresh bucket.
[145:26.94]Play Fortnite.
[145:27.68]Play Fortnite.
[145:28.40]Play Fortnite.
[145:30.55]I would never play Fortnite.
[145:33.45]I just... It's not... It's not... I know... I understand it's fun.
[145:36.03]It takes... Well, I don't know if that's true for me.
[145:39.27]If you think it's fun, I'm glad you do.
[145:41.58]But... It's... I can't.
[145:43.96]I can't play VR games.
[145:53.75]It's actually fun.
[145:56.38]No, you didn't- oh, what a dumb boomer.
[145:58.68]He can't even make a fucking present bridge.
[146:00.44]Oh, yeah?
[146:13.61]Why am I accepting that, like, the boomer word?
[146:17.81]Why is that- why am I saying that now?
[146:22.11]What have you guys done to me?
[146:24.87]Okay.
[146:26.07]We're looking pretty good.
[146:33.96]Alright.
[146:34.96]So, basement it is.
[146:36.66]What is down in the basement we have?
[146:38.30]That's not gonna take that long.
[146:41.46]We're getting close to being done.
[146:43.41]A lot of bottles, a lot of broken glass.
[146:45.11]Don't come down here with bare feet.
[146:46.47]That's a reindeer.
[146:53.27]Was I throwing these down here?
[147:01.65]I don't have a doormat, but this will work, right?
[147:08.78]Get off of me!
[147:10.80]Get off of me!
[147:13.94]Why?
[147:19.16]Okay.
[147:28.99]Hmm, how am I gonna do this?
[147:34.52]I have to bring the trash down there.
[147:36.38]Forget about the water for now.
[147:38.48]Give me one of these.
[147:43.79]Again!
[147:44.13]Do it again!
[147:54.43]Okay.
[147:59.21]Start from the back.
[148:01.07]Uhhh, maybe I should- Uhhh, yeah.
[148:04.55]I want a bucket too.
[148:05.17]Wait.
[148:05.38]We don't even need this anymore.
[148:16.60]It's not playing any music.
[148:18.82]Am I gonna play Classic WoW?
[148:27.35]I don't think so.
[148:30.59]I just got big burnout the day the funk died.
[148:35.97]Oh, it's because I broke the boombox, okay.
[148:40.77]We got our own boombox, don't worry.
[148:46.84]Okay, would you guys be upset if I played this game way more?
[148:49.16]Because... I like this game.
[148:58.89]I think I want to play it a lot more.
[149:08.17]It's something very therapeutic.
[149:12.01]And we can talk about Fortnite.
[149:14.19]That went in my eye.
[149:15.58]That went in my eye.
[149:17.80]Am I wearing glasses?
[149:18.62]I hope so.
[149:19.16]Alright, we're gonna put these up on the stairs.
[149:29.08]Get them all in the same place so they don't... You down here.
[149:36.78]Safety goggles up, please.
[149:38.06]Mmm, this is getting kind of full.
[149:39.84]Let's give it a little shake.
[149:40.70]Okay, that's better.
[150:12.09]Because now I can still fit stuff in it.
[150:14.23]We got a reindeer body?
[150:15.39]I'm gonna have to shake it another time.
[150:17.79]There's a battle theme!
[150:24.31]Battle theme!
[150:39.28]Alright, I don't want to track dirt.
[150:40.34]Hold on.
[150:52.94]Mmm, got a lot of glass noises.
[150:58.36]Ah!
[151:01.68]It's alright.
[151:04.21]This is a really weird ride for this guy.
[151:10.55]Okay.
[151:12.99]I didn't track any dirt, what are you talking about?
[151:14.77]We're good.
[151:15.07]Alright, need another one.
[151:18.00]Press shift to walk.
[151:19.84]Oh, just like that crafting game.
[151:24.86]What the fuck was that?
[151:37.33]What the hell happened?
[151:47.77]What?
[151:48.51]What the fuck?
[151:50.11]Alcohol in the bottles?
[151:51.29]I thought they were empty.
[152:03.28]This is, uh, the castle.
[152:04.50]That's not gonna fit.
[152:28.71]What?
[152:38.23]Is a reindeer head made out of molotovs?
[152:40.35]Is that thing gonna be fine?
[152:46.89]Alright.
[152:47.98]Any more reindeer antlers?
[152:50.72]Yeah, I gotta get rid of these.
[152:51.54]They're not gonna fit the box.
[153:06.45]I'm making a mess?
[153:08.67]Well, I have to make a mess first down here, because I have to take these one by one.
[153:13.87]They're not going to fit in the box.
[153:16.67]And I'm trying to jump to not track this blood everywhere.
[153:19.16]Which I'm not.
[153:20.98]This is the last piece.
[153:28.04]Alright.
[153:29.32]Let's get... Thank you for that.
[153:32.36]I want two buckets.
[153:37.86]Thanks again, appreciate it.
[153:42.59]Thank you!
[153:45.57]Oh, I'm sorry, I bumped you.
[153:50.19]Now I need a box, and this should be good, because I'm gonna do one on either side.
[153:53.38]I don't even need a box, I got one right here!
[153:58.16]Where did this come from?
[153:59.20]When did I bring this down?
[154:00.02]Okay, reindeer chunks.
[154:19.72]Okay, I think that, okay, that's already done for me.
[154:24.50]See?
[154:25.72]That bucket's already full.
[154:26.84]So we're gonna stick with that kind of theory here and just put, fill these buckets.
[154:32.60]And then we have a smaller amount of things to take up.
[154:37.86]Let's see if I can stuff him in here.
[154:43.72]No, just put him in the big one.
[154:53.02]Hmm... Upside down, get in.
[155:08.45]Alright, that's as good as it's gonna get.
[155:09.61]Now you can fit in here.
[155:19.22]What is all this?
[155:27.46]Take it up.
[155:30.22]I gotta come back.
[155:42.18]Give me another one.
[155:44.04]I can see the finish line, so can I. This is a lot more fun than I remember it being a long time ago.
[155:58.19]This is... I'm having a great time.
[155:59.97]I really am.
[156:00.51]Any of the dangerous stuff up here?
[156:14.93]No, this one's pretty much done.
[156:17.75]I will have to- I'll go through and check the, uh, the Ecto... thing.
[156:22.03]Alright.
[156:28.44]I need another box.
[156:41.19]Play Simpsons Hit and Run.
[156:44.01]I will.
[156:45.32]Not now.
[156:46.90]I'm cleaning up something.
[156:48.88]Okay.
[156:54.78]Almost ready for the mop, and I get two buckets down here.
[157:00.95]Just need to bring up the last bits and pieces.
[157:10.86]Mmm, give it a shake.
[157:13.46]Good!
[157:17.56]Make him play the Contra OST?
[157:23.08]Contra?
[157:27.55]Why Contra?
[157:36.67]So this is it.
[157:37.37]After this, I just have to mop up and make sure everything's done.
[157:43.08]What was the estimated play time for this one?
[157:45.08]Four or five hours?
[157:46.14]I did it in, like, three.
[157:53.37]What the fuck?
[157:54.27]Okay.
[158:00.17]And we just got the little nerf pellets.
[158:01.77]I gotta bring this over here.
[158:02.57]It's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[158:07.02]Right there.
[158:07.36]So now I can turn and just be real, real clean about it.
[158:13.99]It's a boss fight.
[158:17.85]But not a real boss fight.
[158:18.93]This is like a mid-level boss.
[158:27.74]Not to be confused with a real boss.
[158:29.38]You'll know what that is when you hear it.
[158:39.93]Really?
[158:50.78]Uh, where'd it go?
[158:57.66]Okay, well, whatever.
[159:02.12]It's time to start mopping.
[159:04.34]Back wall.
[159:09.80]This would be so clean, and I'm gonna get an A+.
[159:12.00]Alright, that one's dirty.
[159:21.18]Alright, next one.
[159:26.48]This is really bloody down here, this is gonna take a while.
[159:28.26]This is, uh, Frogsong.
[159:36.56]For those of you that are curious, why am I addressing the DJ?
[159:40.92]And coming up next we have Frogsong from Chrono Trigger.
[159:44.54]This song played when, any time Frog was on the screen.
[159:49.09]Coming at you soon here, KXW91145.
[159:49.95]Frog's theme.
[159:51.19]Alright.
[160:21.33]905.3, the rat!
[160:22.33]You're listening to the- Don't spill, I'm not gonna spill.
[160:32.69]Readyyyyy... Aha!
[160:45.54]Hey look, we won!
[160:46.42]This is a victory theme!
[160:58.58]I need a few of these.
[160:59.20]I forgot I had this here.
[161:07.97]It's alright.
[161:08.55]I packed it so well that nothing's gonna fall out.
[161:21.29]Oh, fun fact.
[161:22.29]Uh, that was Frog's theme turning into, uh, victory or, uh... Oh, hold on.
[161:48.54]This is the court.
[161:49.08]Uh, I need to get everything empty from here.
[161:57.52]Let's take this.
[161:59.32]Because this is just one bucket.
[162:22.71]I was holding shift and this whole thing is dumping out.
[162:26.63]God, give me a break!
[162:29.39]Oh!
[162:29.63]It's because I was holding shift and I was being careful.
[162:33.65]I should've just fucking walked out.
[162:40.91]So if I was doing a speedrun, speedrunners of this game, if that just happened, would that be like a FUCK reset moment?
[162:56.24]And the reset would be really quick too, it would be like and they're starting again.
[162:59.35]It'd be like click click click click click click and do a game.
[163:11.21]Alright, let's get this out of here.
[163:21.67]I'm walking!
[163:22.29]I'm not running, I'm walking!
[163:35.78]Alright, give me another one.
[163:37.70]Give me another bucket.
[163:38.54]I want two.
[163:40.04]Give me another incinerator.
[163:45.71]And I have to use this right now because of this stupid shit here.
[163:48.43]They give you the zombie parts.
[163:50.56]I just want a thing to put people in.
[164:06.81]The finish line?
[164:07.85]It is in sight.
[164:08.87]Nobody said that, but the finish line is in sight.
[164:13.69]Stop the stream, I'm trying to eat.
[164:16.97]Good luck with that right now.
[164:26.81]Still eating?
[164:32.43]I'm sorry.
[164:33.33]That was real.
[164:33.93]I don't know why.
[164:34.39]I'm sorry about that.
[164:36.21]I'm sorry.
[164:41.49]Just think of it like this.
[164:42.25]This is just barbecue.
[164:44.58]See?
[164:45.46]That's barbecue sauce, and this is like a nice spare rib.
[164:48.78]Oh, this is like a chunk of brisket.
[164:50.36]Just think of it like that.
[164:52.26]See?
[164:52.50]This is a spare rib.
[164:55.44]Okay.
[164:56.12]Offscreen.
[164:56.82]Look at it offscreen.
[164:58.81]If I told you that this was... Forget about... Wait, we can't see the hand.
[165:01.57]Right there.
[165:02.55]If I told you this was like a nice barbecue spare rib... Right now, look at it.
[165:07.07]Like, right there.
[165:10.21]You wouldn't be able to know.
[165:13.56]What if you were vegan?
[165:14.36]Well, then you wouldn't be eating it anyway.
[165:15.46]It's the courtroom part two.
[165:27.73]Alright, I fucked this all up because I'm being an idiot.
[165:36.23]I'm just in one of those moods today, for some reason.
[165:37.97]Alright, let's take this downstairs.
[165:52.36]People are eating.
[165:54.50]Well, every time there's something gross on the screen, just look away.
[166:17.79]No.
[166:18.55]Alright.
[166:19.09]Oh, can I stack the buckets in each other?
[166:31.04]Yep.
[166:45.99]I gotta weigh it down.
[166:58.00]I'm walking.
[167:01.47]Okay, watch out for that.
[167:10.31]Perfect.
[167:24.60]Alright.
[167:25.94]Let's go back to what I was doing down here.
[167:28.92]That's a new bucket of water.
[167:32.30]And then I can do the final pass-through.
[167:34.12]That's gotta go.
[167:36.36]That's gonna get me points docked if that stays down here.
[167:38.66]Just you stay down here for now.
[167:47.73]This is in the future.
[167:54.66]This is what happens when you get to the future.
[168:05.80]Alright, looks pretty clean back here except for the bucket.
[168:07.56]Okay.
[168:23.61]Right, that's there.
[168:25.56]I gotta put these in a container to bring up.
[168:30.98]Is that all the... Bring this out of here.
[168:33.08]Let's put it on the table.
[168:45.74]This can go in there too.
[168:57.27]Get another box over here that I don't need.
[169:12.54]Actually, yeah, I do.
[169:13.24]I need to put the flash drives in there.
[169:15.91]What's in here?
[169:16.35]Oh, right.
[169:18.69]Okay.
[169:18.95]I'm going to get rid of this now.
[169:34.63]That leaves me with this.
[169:36.75]To put some small remaining stuff in, like these flash drives.
[169:43.82]And I'm gonna dump him in front... the front door.
[169:46.55]That's gonna give me some points.
[170:10.38]Okay.
[170:11.32]Where's that bucket?
[170:12.88]This is- they're too dirty?
[170:14.78]Yeah... I can't put the bucket in here.
[170:19.37]Shit!
[170:19.99]It's so- I gotta walk back.
[170:26.99]I'll clean it up later, don't worry.
[170:29.30]We're on crunch time here now.
[170:36.97]If I spill this, I'm gonna be very upset.
[170:40.61]See?
[170:44.03]That doesn't count.
[170:44.83]It's inside the fire.
[170:47.89]What else is down here?
[170:52.21]Okay.
[170:53.91]Need to get this out of the way.
[170:55.41]There's no more items.
[171:02.97]Okay, I need a bucket.
[171:08.63]Hey look, it's a bucket!
[171:09.73]I need it right here.
[171:18.34]Only the final room is the entryway, and then I can clock out.
[171:21.14]I'll dump that in there.
[171:33.85]Just turn it upside down and I'll throw this away.
[171:43.86]I can't... I jumped over it, see?
[171:46.60]Alright, here we go.
[171:52.11]Cool.
[171:58.43]Uh, I'm gonna leave that one for trash.
[172:00.63]Because they're probably stray trash.
[172:02.17]Where's my bucket?
[172:30.96]Okay, I did it.
[172:31.74]That didn't spill it.
[172:39.18]Okay.
[172:41.05]Down here, and then just clean up the blood, and that should be it.
[172:43.97]Then I can do the final room.
[172:46.11]Hopefully there's not that much where I need a second bucket, but there probably will be.
[172:50.86]It's already getting a little dirty.
[172:59.93]Shit, I'm gonna need another bucket.
[173:01.89]Ah!
[173:10.61]Or am I?
[173:13.00]Mmm, it's yeah.
[173:14.38]Yes, I do.
[173:28.58]Give me another bucket.
[173:32.64]Am I ever going to play Mother 3?
[173:33.94]Earthbound 2?
[173:40.36]Earthbound was Mother 2, right?
[173:46.08]Uh... Put this in here.
[173:53.05]Oh, by the way, there is... Ah, there's dynamite in there.
[173:54.69]Yep.
[173:55.55]Goodbye.
[173:55.85]Is that... It's not a controlled blast, though?
[174:00.61]What the fuck?
[174:01.45]What?! !
[174:05.18]The one on the table.
[174:07.20]I knew there was dynamite in there, but the one on the table to the right.
[174:15.78]I knew there was dynamite in that one.
[174:17.16]That's why I didn't, but I thought... How are you supposed to get rid of those?
[174:28.85]Scripted joke.
[174:29.69]No, I knew there was dynamite in there.
[174:31.77]I said it as I was walking up.
[174:36.31]But so if you put dynamite in the water, but then what happens when you throw that in the trash?
[174:40.02]Okay, hold on.
[174:40.62]If you put dynamite in water, and then you put the dynamite into the fire, doesn't it just blow up?
[174:54.51]Just don't throw it away.
[174:55.51]No, it doesn't.
[174:56.21]It doesn't.
[175:00.70]No, I knew I put the dynamite in that one.
[175:02.30]I just didn't know if it was gonna set off the... Why am I putting this over here?
[175:10.28]Not a controlled burn in the trash.
[175:12.40]Why would that happen?
[175:15.26]Oh, he fucking scripted it!
[175:16.57]Oh, it was scripted!
[175:29.16]See, he knew that was going to happen, and that's why he did it.
[175:33.21]Notice the frame.
[175:34.05]Notice the frame right before he puts... Look, I froze it here.
[175:38.23]Notice the frame right before he walked forward.
[175:40.19]He glanced to the right a little to make sure that he was in line of sight for the other explosion.
[175:45.46]And what he did is he made sure he was close enough, and then he stepped a step to his right to make sure he got blown up.
[175:50.02]I recorded it, and I saw it.
[175:54.11]Got five community subs.
[175:59.76]By Chungi.
[176:02.04]Thank you for the five community subs.
[176:09.16]He admitted it.
[176:14.76]No, I didn't.
[176:15.93]I was pretending to be somebody.
[176:18.69]That was pretending to think that I did that on purpose.
[176:25.41]But did he?
[176:25.81]I don't know.
[176:29.87]And that's an anonymous gifter.
[176:32.05]10 community subs from... Nobody.
[176:38.85]From anonymous.
[176:40.75]Whoever anonymous is, thank you so much.
[176:43.45]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[176:47.67]Thank you for... And then Chungi came in with another 5.
[176:50.27]That's 10 from Chungi here.

[176:58.24]Thank you.
[177:02.75]Thank you to the both of you.
[177:05.73]Alright, hold on.
[177:17.36]Hold on a minute.
[177:17.78]Let me, uh... Hold on.
[177:19.52]Let me script out something here.
[177:20.66]Make sure I get this, like, you know, I have to sit here and plan this.
[177:24.24]It's okay.

[178:28.59]Some people have given almost a hundred.
[178:30.39]More than a hundred community subs.

[178:34.81]Thank you, guys.
[178:35.53]Thank you!

[179:24.42]It's going too fast, I don't know who was picked.
[179:29.57]Pilot guy, five community subs.
[179:32.39]Thank you.
[179:37.31]I wasn't looking at it, I was looking at the chat, because there's a lot of... Fender, uh, McBender for five community subs.

[180:23.61]Oh lord.
[180:25.57]This is just Rick Roll.
[180:27.02]Yeah, I mean, it sounds pretty similar, but it's not.
[180:29.08]It's not that song.
[180:32.06]It's not Rick Roll.
[180:33.72]Uh, this has just been ruined for me.
[180:36.00]Uh, thank you, Spazz, for the five community subs.

[181:11.95]I mean, I thought about it.
[181:18.76]Where's mine?
[181:20.12]Maybe one day, if you're a somewhat generous person from chat.
[181:27.15]but thank you guys, that was fucking crazy.
[181:29.15]It really is.
[181:34.89]Spaz, five more subs from Spaz.

[182:04.32]Spaz gave a shitload.
[182:06.76]There's so many of you who just gave so many subs.
[182:11.73]Okay.
[182:12.87]Blood on the bird's nest?
[182:16.01]Not anymore.
[182:16.45]This is pretty good.

[182:27.88]With more.
[182:31.94]Attack of the Hawk.
[182:33.06]Five community subs.
[182:35.85]Holy shit.
[182:36.67]Alright, don't blow this up.
[182:37.83]What do I do with this?
[182:40.49]Can I like... I'm going to put this in the water because it's an explosive.
[182:45.25]What?
[182:50.98]Thank you, Spaz, for five community subs.
[182:55.46]That scared the shit out of me.
[182:57.52]Oh my god, just get rid of it.
[183:04.01]Thank you guys for all your subs.
[183:05.89]It's so many.
[183:07.63]It's so fucking many.
[183:17.21]You guys are something else.
[183:18.13]Thank you.
[183:25.03]All these subs and all he manages to do is rickroll and spill jokes.
[183:29.74]You gotta take the joke off of it.
[183:31.58]Can't it just be a spill?
[183:35.03]Does the joke have to be on the other end of that?
[183:37.29]Can't it just be, I spilled?
[183:46.05]What?
[183:46.33]I almost just lost internet there.
[184:08.65]I think I laughed too hard, the internet wanted to turn off.
[184:10.73]Doctor, thank you, Doctor Mothord.
[184:14.84]Five subs.
[184:16.08]Spaz, five more subs.
[184:23.67]I can't even keep up with it, you guys are giving so many, thank you.
[184:26.29]I don't even know what to say anymore.
[184:35.56]You spend a lot of money, a lot of you guys... Did that blow up again?
[184:39.70]What?
[184:39.92]Uh, this is the end of time.
[184:54.23]Why am I still dictating the soundtrack of Chrono Trigger for you guys?
[184:58.55]Just play the game.
[184:59.47]It's one of the best games ever.
[185:01.07]Just play it.
[185:04.97]Alright, what's left?
[185:10.73]As of this moment, this is the end of time.
[185:12.35]It plays quite a bit in the series.
[185:16.75]What am I, like a song review channel?
[185:29.30]End of the stream voice.
[185:30.26]I have to finish this level first.
[185:34.34]Oh, that, okay, that is the end of the stream, boys, you're right.
[185:37.88]Okay, guys, so, um, I think, uh... Well, uh, hmm, okay.
[185:49.60]By the way, I want to make sure everyone's aware that the, uh, I hope you got a suggestion in for the Secret Santa chat, Secret Santa Christmas suggestion.
[186:00.76]Because the polls... Well, not the polls.
[186:03.22]The suggestions in that Discord are now, I think, pretty much officially closed.
[186:11.69]Somebody said, I forgot.
[186:12.65]I'm sorry, but I really have to get stuff ordered for Christmas Eve stream.
[186:18.99]So I really can only give about 24 hours or like 30 hours or so of time.
[186:24.35]Why did I just put that present in the fire?
[186:25.91]I don't know.
[186:26.90]What's this?
[186:28.72]It was my birthday Friday, and mommy got me only 23 presents and a soccer field cake.
[186:32.78]I hate her.
[186:33.64]I said you were better.
[186:34.30]I want 23 steak pies, 12 ice creams, 18 trays of reindeer chocolate, 3 big... big boxes of fudge, a pear, 5 computer with conscription, 3 brown and an intent nitro genie.
[186:52.02]Whatever, fuck off.
[187:04.64]This is the trainer.
[187:05.78]Stop!
[187:06.08]I don't- Okay, I'm not gonna tell you what another song is.
[187:08.52]But I love this song, though.
[187:09.56]Okay.
[187:16.07]There's blood on the doorframe?
[187:23.57]I'll take care of that.
[187:29.50]Where?
[187:47.42]I think that's it.
[187:49.76]The other door.
[187:56.07]This is not a door?!
[187:59.03]You should have said the exploded wall.
[188:01.38]Door?!
[188:01.68]Door?! !
[188:08.29]Alright, we are close.
[188:10.13]So close.
[188:11.43]This is only... Grandpa's study.
[188:14.97]Grandpa, um... What the fuck is this place?
[188:17.51]I don't know, watch this!
[188:21.18]Molotov cocktail!
[188:22.60]Oops.
[188:35.75]No?
[188:41.60]Apparently not.
[188:50.58]Are they empty?
[188:52.58]Is that the problem?
[188:53.56]That one's still there.
[188:58.82]Alright, can I...
[189:12.07]No, it didn't do anything!
[189:16.33]Just... that's water in there.
[189:18.65]Spaz gave another 10 community subs.
[189:24.81]You have to be reaching some kind of extreme level here.
[189:30.89]Next slide, please.
[189:32.42]I think we're running through like a rough patch right now?
[189:37.18]Sometimes it happens.
[189:40.58]It's eggnog?
[189:41.36]Eggnog is alcoholic.
[189:45.29]Is it non-alcoholic eggnog?
[189:49.31]But yeah, Spaz, you've given so many.
[189:55.73]Yeah, sometimes you get a rough patch.
[189:58.01]The internet was fixed like a month or two ago.
[190:03.56]But sometimes it still does happen.
[190:04.76]Sometimes it's a little dip that lasts probably five to ten minutes.
[190:07.60]And then it smooths out.
[190:11.86]Usually.
[190:12.46]Unless something else went wrong, but I don't think so.
[190:13.86]Alright, I want a new Playbox 180 and a new iPhone 732S and the new Racer Man car driver game.
[190:21.56]I also want a new bike because the one I got last year is dirty and I want a new Windbreaker air rifle too.
[190:25.93]I've been so good and I want these.
[190:34.47]Is this eggnog?
[190:36.63]Thick and slimy, 100% foreign... 100% pride and... I don't understand.
[190:43.47]There's no alcohol in this.
[190:50.16]Happy Christmas, this year I won a new... Damn it, too long.
[191:02.22]I have in my possession video footage of you along with your gang entering one of my premises via the fireplace.
[191:07.46]The footage also shows littering and you personally removing my valuable property, milk, glass, and confectionery items.
[191:13.95]At present, I'm preparing to forward this evidence to the local authorities unless I receive compensation from your organization in the sum of no less than $100,000.
[191:21.14]I've generously decided to give you until Monday to complete this transaction or face the consequences.
[191:30.69]Where was I keeping these?
[191:31.86]To make sure I had them?
[191:32.50]Right here.
[191:57.90]Fist Claws!
[191:58.56]Yuletide greeting, Fist Claws.
[191:59.60]I represent a select group of people with great gift-giving ambitions.
[192:04.90]Oh boy.
[192:11.31]Uh... I'm in jail again and need bail money.
[192:15.27]I was caught.
[192:17.37]Whip.
[192:20.27]What the fuck are these letters?! !
[192:25.89]It's a great regret that I find myself forced to write this correspondence once more, as our investigation determined that the atrocity's conditions, when you force upon elven brethren, must cease immediately.
[192:33.37]The low pay, the incredibly long work days, the lack of holidays, it's inhuman if we go to... If we at the Union do not see a radical change, we'll be forced to pursue legal channels.
[192:41.94]And then, sir, you shall see the full fury of the elves is not so small.
[192:52.86]Invoice, your total for this month comes to toys, $953,000!
[192:56.70]5 million for electronic devices, 35,000 for shipping.
[193:14.63]Streamer hates unions?
[193:16.13]What?
[193:16.43]No, I was... I was looking at the...
[193:20.37]They said they were coming after me, so I wanted to just burn it.
[193:36.09]No.
[193:38.47]No, stop it!
[193:40.29]I... Stop it, Cox.
[193:46.61]I know, really.
[193:48.50]You wanna get over this like weird internet hiccup you got going on right now for some reason?
[193:58.00]Alright, I need a box in here.
[194:06.87]I kinda ruined everything over there.
[194:08.03]Alright, I need a box.
[194:14.88]Hey, uh, no, I'm not gonna do it.
[194:16.74]I'm gonna break up.
[194:18.34]I'm not gonna say the V-E-T-E-R.
[194:23.11]I'm not gonna say P-E-T-E-R.
[194:30.47]I almost did it.
[194:36.58]I was going to say it, you're right.
[194:38.06]It was close.
[194:46.56]Is this your favorite song from Corner Trigger?
[194:52.56]The whole soundtrack is great.
[195:00.57]What's Spider-Man's real name?
[195:02.49]P-E-T-E-R.
[195:04.63]P-A-R-K-E-R.
[195:12.75]How am I gonna get under there?
[195:14.31]How do I get under there?
[195:16.76]I can't get that bullet that's over there.
[195:20.96]Is this alcohol?
[195:23.83]Yeah.
[195:29.51]There we go, nice.
[195:46.29]Short stream, by the way.
[195:49.31]I know, I gotta get like, I gotta get this shit ready and ordered and everything.
[195:52.49]I'm not... live tomorrow.
[195:57.75]Get... What is it hitting?
[196:09.44]Just take it and get rid of it.
[196:16.14]Yeah, I'm not gonna be around tomorrow.
[196:18.01]I'm gonna just spend pretty much the whole day.
[196:20.19]I got a doctor appointment, and then I want to get shit ready for tonight, and then get shit ready tomorrow, and make sure everything is ready to go completely for the Christmas Eve stream.
[196:30.92]You'll see me again on Saturday.
[196:32.16]Oh my god.
[196:37.04]Don't be dynamite.
[196:37.72]Okay.
[196:58.50]What does that mean?
[197:05.86]Okay, whatever.
[197:06.50]They really just don't want me to be able to end this, do they?
[197:10.90]The sub notifications are still going?
[197:15.10]There were so many.
[197:16.82]There were so many subs.
[197:19.50]Alright, don't make the same mistake you make every time.
[197:24.31]Just place it on the table.
[197:30.50]There!
[197:31.32]No explosion!
[197:49.11]Yeah, the subs were out of control.
[197:55.84]All the community subs, all the subs.
[197:57.68]This channel has so many subscribers now.
[198:00.00]It's fucking crazy.
[198:03.34]Honest to God.
[198:07.35]Thank you guys.
[198:08.97]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[198:13.25]I'm gonna have a lot of extra points to give out here.
[198:17.63]And speaking of subs, five more from Spaz.
[198:21.94]My God.
[198:23.64]Thanks, dude.
[198:27.91]I gotta get under there.
[198:31.41]How do I get under there?
[198:32.21]Do I have to baseball swing?
[198:34.37]Ooh, look at that.
[198:37.85]Figured it out.
[198:46.31]Never answered my Mother 3 question.
[198:47.87]Well, I have to play Mother 1 and Mother 2.
[198:50.41]Before I play Mother 3.
[198:54.91]I mean, I know who Lucas is, because I maimed him in Brawl.
[199:02.68]Get over here.
[199:03.58]I mean, no I didn't.
[199:08.38]Yes, I did.
[199:14.21]Did I get it?
[199:19.87]Ah, that felt really good to get.
[199:30.54]I gotta go around.
[199:31.68]Come on.
[199:34.68]Did I loosen it?
[199:37.93]It's like getting popcorn out of your teeth.
[199:39.33]Come on.
[199:40.33]Go.
[199:47.49]Got it.
[199:50.69]Or did I?
[199:58.33]Nice.
[200:01.52]And what do you do?
[200:02.54]You put it back in your mouth and you eat it!
[200:03.84]Does somebody know what that is?
[200:09.96]Come on.
[200:15.70]Somebody has to know what that is.
[200:21.50]I'm waiting for someone to know who's Biff that is.
[200:23.24]Are you serious?
[200:27.53]None of you.
[200:35.19]Wow.
[200:36.71]I'm surprised.
[200:37.69]That was George Carlin.
[200:55.56]Are you guys saying who?
[200:56.50]Oh, I right-clicked!
[201:09.62]It's a meme song.
[201:12.72]Why is this a meme song?
[201:14.62]What are you talking about?
[201:19.48]Meme song.
[201:27.53]George R. R. Martin is the guy that will never write the whole story of a song in Ice and Fire.
[201:33.61]A song of Ice and Fire.
[201:37.49]He's thinking of two different people.
[201:45.28]Oh my god.
[201:48.82]Well, you see, it's almost done.
[201:50.02]You see, what Tyrion wants... The thing is... Let me tell you something.
[201:55.58]In about ten years... By the way, I write with one finger.
[202:00.64]Get in the clown car.
[202:01.36]Thank you for the ten community subs.
[202:07.66]Ten more from getting the clown car.
[202:10.88]Well, you see, that's the thing is... I just...
[202:15.11]When I write, I usually write very slowly, and it takes me about four months to write one page.
[202:23.30]And that's okay, but you know, I just love... What do you mean?
[202:33.06]He's... That's not Owen Wilson.
[202:42.09]I mean, it kind of is.
[202:45.49]Don't hit that!
[202:46.21]That's gonna explode!
[202:47.91]Sit up here!
[202:51.41]What are you saying?
[202:52.40]Well, wow, the thing is, when I wrote that book... What the fuck?
[203:04.54]No, what's going on with my internet?
[203:05.80]Why is it doing this again?
[203:08.80]Cut it out, Cox.
[203:10.00]It's not funny anymore.
[203:28.48]Okay, this is dirty.
[203:36.74]I'm looking over at OBS to see how many frames I'm dropping.
[203:39.35]Because I need to know, I can't even see, I have to alt-tab.
[204:00.51]Alright, that's good to go.
[204:01.49]This is pretty much all done.
[204:11.72]Always funny spill joke.
[204:13.78]It's not always funny.
[204:22.23]What did that just knock over?
[204:23.01]I don't know, but I think that's good.
[204:25.95]Make sure the bookcases are all clean.
[204:32.73]Norway is fine.
[204:33.91]This room is done.
[204:34.91]Need to set up.
[204:39.39]Alright, we're done!
[204:40.28]Just get this out of here.
[204:47.18]And then I'll double check.
[204:48.08]Okay.
[205:02.23]Basement... I love this comment.
[205:04.31]Basement stable.
[205:05.30]Right wall.
[205:08.06]You got it.
[205:09.44]I'll get it.
[205:14.22]Right click the painting.
[205:15.62]What painting?
[205:16.88]This painting.
[205:21.19]What do you want me to do that for?
[205:28.97]That's a fucking... Where did that come from?
[205:38.10]Did I just spawn that?
[205:49.55]With hands, what are you- it doesn't do anything.
[206:01.26]Where did this come from?
[206:06.20]The painting, that's a poster.
[206:26.19]It doesn't do anything.
[206:32.73]Okay, I need to dispose of this.
[206:35.49]So we got water.
[206:37.36]Right here.
[206:39.08]Here we go.
[206:39.50]Ready?
[206:43.20]What?
[206:43.98]What the fuck was that?
[206:45.44]Okay.
[206:46.18]So this is not gonna light on fire.
[206:47.38]You guys told me once it's in water, it can't be lit on fire.
[206:53.83]Right?
[206:56.27]Okay.
[206:58.21]Thanks for the lie!
[206:59.09]Thanks for lying to me!
[207:00.19]Appreciate it!
[207:11.68]Thanks for the lie!
[207:14.86]If you put it in water, it won't- it's- you throw it in the fire and it's fine.
[207:21.22]That wasn't just one guy, it was like 40 people.
[207:24.26]That was 40 guys.
[207:31.00]Keep it in the water?
[207:32.57]What?
[207:33.75]I drenched it.
[207:35.17]I dunked it.
[207:35.89]How do you... Whatever, this is done now.
[207:49.07]What is going on?
[207:49.71]Why are they spawning?
[207:57.24]Okay, well...
[208:02.88]So you're telling me... See, it is now impossible for this to light.
[208:09.69]Keep it in the bucket and then put the bucket in the fire.
[208:14.81]What the hell was that?
[208:19.48]Did it work?
[208:23.48]It worked.
[208:41.05]It's gotta stay in the bucket.
[208:42.41]No, I'm not.
[208:44.07]I'm gonna just put the fucking dynamite in a box and put over under the tree It fell out of the bucket That doesn't matter That does not matter at all Why did I turn into a broom?
[208:58.43]Where did this broom come from?
[209:01.04]What the hell is this?
[209:04.14]What is that?
[209:10.25]What is this thing?
[209:21.59]Whatever, okay.
[209:22.95]If there's another stick of dynamite in here, I'm gonna be fucking mad.
[209:25.11]Alright, we're good.
[209:33.48]Okay, I'm done.
[209:34.54]I just need to clean up a little bit more.
[209:36.46]No more random spawns of dynamite.
[209:38.34]I gotta get rid of my old body.
[209:43.14]This is just like Diablo II, man, except I'm worth my gear.
[209:51.01]Whatever, one of you guys went...
[210:04.35]Remember when this only took two hours?
[210:06.49]Yeah, I do.
[210:13.53]It's with heavy heart and dwindling pocket that we inform you that you owe of being sued.
[210:16.47]Eh, whatever.

[211:10.39]The rock painting.
[211:14.87]Alright, you can't think I'm that much of a fucking dummy.

[211:24.84]What?
[211:26.03]That's not real.
[211:46.49]Any more?
[211:46.85]That's cool.

[214:20.06]I ain't gonna get fucking derailed.
[214:21.80]Oh, a tennis ball!
[214:32.76]I'm gonna do... There's a red spot.

[215:54.10]Okay.
[216:31.93]I'm fucking outta here.
[216:38.41]Isn't this secret fucking blow-up-the-door bullshit?
[216:43.38]And now look what you made me do.
[216:44.86]Oh, alright, I'm done.
[216:46.32]I'm cleaning up and I'm gonna put the SD cards into the slots and then that's it.
[216:54.70]That's the oldest trick in the book?
[216:55.92]I don't know, this has been out for like a couple years.
[216:59.82]You guys might know secrets that I don't know.
[217:03.36]That's very possible.
[217:04.14]Alright, we're close.
[217:19.43]Why would there be an unlit TNT if there wasn't a secret?
[217:23.89]Well, because didn't I already blow up the wall already?
[217:27.75]Why would I throw that?
[217:29.31]Why would I throw it like that, like immediately?
[217:32.31]Alright.
[217:41.64]Save the TNT for the Santa fight.
[217:44.83]That has to be bullshit, right?
[217:46.05]Alright, broken bottle.
[217:57.61]We're almost done.
[218:07.03]Couple of streaks.
[218:08.47]I'll take care of that.
[218:09.35]Ah!
[218:14.47]I don't know why, I don't know what that was.
[218:22.03]I immediately did not know what I was doing.
[218:25.23]Oh, paintball.
[218:31.99]I'm gonna tidy up the place a little bit, make it look nicer.
[218:35.19]So I get extra points.
[218:42.42]Alright.
[218:43.50]This room is good to go.
[218:45.18]This is nice and cleaned up.
[218:49.16]Presents are up on the table.
[218:50.92]Down here.
[218:53.20]Let's pull out the meter.
[219:05.60]How would you not pick this up?
[219:23.22]I think this one's done.
[219:25.02]Wait, wait, wait.
[219:28.12]Right here?
[219:28.40]There's an elf in the chat.
[219:38.54]What are you talking about?
[220:01.49]Wait a minute.
[220:03.09]What's the problem over here?
[220:04.03]Ooh.
[220:12.47]Look, an elf.
[220:13.19]What?
[220:26.95]No, don't hit that!
[220:30.55]I think I got it.
[220:35.08]There's an elf up on the shelf.
[220:50.04]Alright.
[220:51.00]Is that it?
[221:15.63]Come here.
[221:16.41]Come here.
[221:16.95]I got you.
[221:21.19]Elf on the shelf.
[221:22.63]That's what you guys are referring to.
[221:23.93]Okay, I get it.
[221:24.49]Alright, is that it?
[221:37.62]I think that- I think this room is clean.
[221:43.46]There's blood on the ceiling.
[221:53.60]It can't be clean while you're in it.
[221:57.46]What was that?
[221:57.78]I just saw a drip.
[222:00.96]What just dripped?
[222:02.84]Did you see that?
[222:03.32]Am I insane?
[222:14.09]Okay.
[222:14.85]Alright, done.
[222:15.91]Take a look.
[222:16.95]Perfect.
[222:17.79]Clean.
[222:18.95]Satisfied.
[222:21.52]Same thing with this room.
[222:22.24]Let's tidy it up.
[222:27.33]There's still blood in there.
[222:28.13]No, I ain't blowing up any more walls with dynamite.
[222:29.65]You ain't gonna get me.
[222:30.17]I'm not... Nope.
[222:30.43]Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
[222:50.75]Yeah uh, we got a problem like the boy who cried wolf here.
[222:56.56]There could be something really important.
[222:58.94]But all I'm gonna hear is throw dynamite.
[223:01.70]Throw dynamite at door, is all I hear.
[223:04.47]Oh, I gotta get... There's a lot of blood on the ceilings.
[223:18.83]I'm not tall enough to do this.
[223:26.36]How am I gonna get that?
[223:28.54]Is that even possible to get?
[223:29.55]I don't think I can get this.
[224:21.66]Are you kidding me right now?
[225:00.45]Are there any more stools?
[225:01.80]Did I burn them?
[225:47.73]Thank you for watching.
[226:43.64]Who said I couldn't do it, huh?
[227:57.57]Right click?
[227:58.37]That's what I'm doing!
[227:59.51]What are you talking about?
[228:06.42]Wet the mop?
[228:18.53]What do you mean, wet the mop?
[228:31.06]God damn it.
[228:33.40]I need to get up there.
[228:40.74]This should be it.
[228:42.72]I don't care if I have to do four.
[228:43.68]I'll get it.
[228:44.02]Because then I can get up there.
[228:47.76]Well, it's going to be one more.
[228:48.88]It's going to have to be four.
[228:53.04]Get a present on there, too.
[229:04.20]Okay, I'll jump from here up to there and then I should be able to get it from here.
[229:09.52]Press tab to extend the mob.
[229:15.96]You fucking guys.
[229:27.53]Give me this present.
[229:37.76]What are you doing?
[229:38.60]Get on.
[229:39.10]Get on there.
[229:57.70]I'm gonna get on this.
[230:07.64]This is Cuphead-level journalist gaming.
[230:10.42]No, it is not.
[230:13.98]This is fucking annoyingly hard to do.
[230:25.39]Cuphead-level journalist gaming.
[230:28.69]How dare you say something like that to me.
[230:32.78]Got it.
[230:42.07]I'm just gonna say it ain't gonna happen, but I could do four right there.
[231:08.62]Use the middle table?
[231:09.68]That's the one I was just on!
[231:12.44]The one I was just on, I couldn't reach with three.
[231:14.04]I gotta get to four!
[231:20.38]This is one of the other best songs.
[231:21.56]This is the epoch.
[231:28.82]You know what?
[231:29.84]There could be a little bit of blood on the ceiling.
[231:36.31]No, it's time to go.
[231:37.01]Here we go.
[231:37.57]Ready?
[232:04.63]It's gonna be four.
[232:11.79]One, two, three... There are enough stools to do four!
[232:20.22]Wrong way!
[232:23.93]That's the one that's gonna be four, right in the middle.
[232:25.49]Fuck!
[232:47.71]One, two, three, four.
[233:07.09]Oh, god damn it!
[233:26.75]I'm almost there.
[233:28.81]I just need to get these... I have to approach from this way.
[233:39.69]Oh no, I got laughing gassed.
[233:46.91]What do I do?
[233:50.05]I just need to get... Alright, one, two, one, two, three.
[233:59.30]Here's two.
[233:59.84]No!
[234:00.86]Uh, this is fun.
[234:07.86]Alright, one, two, I just gotta get this one up here.
[234:10.02]There's the one, two, three.
[234:18.35]Am I gonna have enough stools to do this dumb shit?
[234:30.02]Yep, I will.
[234:30.48]Alright, I'm gonna go very slow with this.
[234:37.82]Oh my!
[234:38.74]I can't even look this way, I have to just guess.
[234:51.83]Oh my god, I'm up.
[234:52.45]Okay, where am I?
[234:53.08]That's one, two... Holy fuck, okay, go, go, go, I can do it.
[235:04.94]Oh my fucking god, I hit the...
[235:53.52]What did you say?
[235:55.15]What did you just say?
[235:57.15]What did you say?
[236:00.07]You said grab the ladder that's in the basement.
[236:06.55]What?
[236:07.65]Where is it?
[236:08.13]What are you talking about?
[236:11.74]Grab the ladder in the basement.
[236:19.28]Oh, I get it.
[236:31.38]I'm fucking throwing a bucket up there.
[236:38.46]Is that gonna work?
[236:39.02]I don't think that's gonna work.
[237:07.36]Is there a reliable way that I can actually get this?
[237:09.66]Because building stools, it seems not possible.
[237:23.13]Presents.
[237:33.54]Just throw them up at the ceiling.
[237:35.40]At this point, I'm willing to try that.
[237:37.04]But I can't.
[237:37.52]How is he still trying?
[237:38.39]Because I have to get that... There's so much blood up on the ceiling.
[237:41.41]How did it even get up there?
[237:46.57]Wait.
[237:46.79]Yeah.
[237:47.07]Fuck this.
[237:47.51]Get this all out of here.
[237:48.27]Are you serious?
[237:53.08]Give me like four of these.
[237:55.08]It's the surface I can tear...
[238:11.25]This is so much more surface area.
[238:38.50]I thought I just killed somebody over there.
[238:44.03]No, what are you doing?
[238:44.95]Okay, right here.
[238:46.37]Can I jump on these?
[238:47.19]I'm not tall enough.
[238:50.68]This is not gonna work.
[238:53.98]I have to be fucking tall enough.
[239:01.52]I need a stool.
[239:24.77]Okay, I need to get up there.
[239:43.15]Come here!
[239:43.75]Why can I not grab it?
[239:45.32]What the fuck?
[239:57.17]I wasn't standing, I was standing on the other one!
[240:04.91]He thought I dropped it.
[240:06.30]So did I. Why is this not working?
[240:36.55]Are you serious?
[241:06.29]Stop giving me this shit!
[241:16.33]What's on here?
[241:21.37]Get off!
[241:22.87]You're ruining everything.
[241:53.22]Where am I?
[241:53.76]What the fuck is happening?
[241:54.70]What did I do?
[241:59.07]What am I gonna do with all these buckets?
[242:47.03]I'm having a breakdown!
[242:48.67]I'm having a breakdown!
[242:56.27]Get on!
[242:56.69]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[243:20.07]What are you doing?
[243:20.97]Hey!
[243:26.89]You're a dud!
[243:27.47]I'm almost done.
[243:40.92]Almost.
[243:41.12]I just need one... That's how I feel right now.
[243:43.74]I feel like screaming like that.
[243:44.82]This is it.
[243:46.38]One, two, three.
[243:47.38]Got it.
[244:03.68]This is it.
[244:18.83]No!
[244:18.95]Yes!
[244:19.29]Yes!
[244:37.42]What about over there?
[244:40.28]Is there any more?
[244:40.98]I don't think there's any more up here.
[244:42.07]Oh, I made a fucking mess.
[244:51.30]Oh, shit.
[244:51.98]Over there.
[244:52.36]I think I can reach that just by jumping on one, though.
[245:10.32]Oh yeah, I got it.
[245:11.63]Oh, thank the Lord.
[245:14.02]Wait.
[245:40.15]I did it.
[245:41.74]Okay.
[245:47.26]This is the I won the game music.
[245:49.90]Oops.
[245:50.90]No, did I get blood on the ceiling?
[246:01.22]I didn't just do that, did I?
[246:03.07]I didn't just do that.
[246:06.23]There's no way I just did that.
[246:11.92]Oh no!
[246:25.10]Nobody saw
[247:19.71]No!
[247:20.93]Alright, burn it!
[247:24.13]Burn it all!
[247:25.41]Burn it all!
[247:26.59]Burn it all!
[247:28.27]I'm done!
[247:28.93]Just pretend you didn't see it!
[247:30.07]Burn it!
[247:31.25]Get it all over there and burn it!
[247:34.35]Forget it!
[247:36.27]Who cares?
[247:36.97]Get this fucking stool out of here!
[247:43.42]Get over here!
[247:58.76]It was all done.
[247:59.64]And look at all this shit that has to burn.
[248:01.64]And the stools have to be set back up.
[248:10.48]What?
[248:10.96]The stools!
[248:11.92]Where are the children going to sit?
[248:31.04]Get him in there!
[248:31.64]I can't fucking believe it.
[248:34.72]Two steps forward, four steps backward.
[248:38.91]Darn it all!
[248:40.13]I don't even want to see this anymore.
[248:44.17]Can I see this present?
[248:44.95]Yeah!
[248:45.59]See you later!
[248:50.01]Blood in fi- I'll get the blood in the fireplace, I know.
[248:54.59]I'm so disappointed.
[248:58.37]Unsightly.
[248:59.65]Oh, I'm so mad.
[249:00.55]No, pick it up.
[249:05.07]Oh, we got married.
[249:07.69]This is the married song.
[249:21.66]What emote is that?
[249:22.70]Ha, ha, ha.
[249:25.00]Look at how clean it is in here.
[249:26.30]Don't do that in here.
[249:28.26]Look at how perfect it is.
[249:29.44]And look at how I fucked up this whole room.
[249:32.00]I was done.
[249:32.54]We were about to turn it off.
[249:38.28]Pick it up.
[249:46.37]I love this game.
[249:47.11]What a fucking joy.
[249:58.57]Merry Christmas everybody!
[250:04.16]Just leave?
[250:04.84]Uh, I've been in here for like four and a half hours.
[250:09.66]I can't just leave.
[250:27.05]I have Gambler's Fallacy.
[250:28.59]I'm not betting any money, I'm cleaning a house!
[250:35.58]Getting there, okay.
[250:57.30]It's a little... Alright, so... I figured out where those splats came from.
[251:05.84]It's from... The little paintballs.
[251:17.12]Okay, so... Let's finish this up.
[251:31.86]What the hell?
[251:32.18]Pick it up.
[251:42.27]What's with the Play Mother 3?
[251:49.26]Oh, don't fucking do that to me.
[251:50.52]Just put this in the trash.
[252:02.30]Do I have any more of those?
[252:04.22]No, I don't.
[252:10.84]We are pretty much done after this.
[252:12.62]I just have to get the little side room there.
[252:20.71]I can actually get that.
[252:22.19]By standing on a stool, I think.
[252:30.15]Yeah, I'm good.
[252:30.97]It's good.
[252:31.37]It's good.
[252:31.67]It's good.
[252:31.93]Don't worry about it.
[252:43.18]Did it go in?
[252:46.05]Alright, we're close.
[252:50.25]What about all the presents that were in this room?
[252:53.65]Could the explosions destroy them all?
[253:04.45]Alright, final pass through on this room is going to be here in a second.
[253:07.19]Alright, how we look?
[253:14.75]Oh, this needs to be picked up.
[253:23.43]See?
[253:24.13]They look nice.
[253:26.35]I'm just going to put these down on the ground.
[253:28.65]They're just going to sit here.
[253:31.80]Right there.
[253:32.26]I'm not touching them.
[253:32.90]They just display.
[253:34.08]Oh, okay.
[253:41.40]I think that's it.
[253:42.92]This room looks good.
[253:44.46]This room is looking better.
[253:45.52]Okay, what else?
[254:02.42]Come on.
[254:04.62]Uh, should I just get one of the boxes and... Just give me a box.
[254:06.84]So I don't have to keep running back and forth.
[254:23.41]Alright, any stray trash?
[254:33.21]Okay.
[254:46.42]Don't.
[254:46.66]Maybe you should check the ceiling.
[254:53.26]Nah, the ceiling's alright.
[254:54.82]I don't even need to look at it.
[255:05.80]Alright.
[255:07.08]Good.
[255:08.26]Everything looks good.
[255:09.49]Except for that.
[255:13.01]There's a present under there, but it's okay.
[255:24.16]I mean, the sniffer is gonna find the blood.
[255:25.94]I mean, there's a lot- I gotta dump this first.
[255:27.86]No, I don't wanna- Hey buddy, I think you missed a spot on the ceiling there.
[255:40.03]The glass bottle.
[255:40.78]Let me check up here one more time.
[255:46.02]I did- yeah, there's like explosions and shit.
[255:49.58]Uhh... Put the wood in the fire, who cares.
[256:09.87]I think that's good.
[256:14.44]Last little bit here.
[256:15.36]I think we're good.
[256:25.40]The entrance?
[256:25.92]Oh, don't worry.
[256:26.88]I've worked my way all the way back to the entrance.
[256:28.26]Uh, I think... I don't know what this is.
[256:35.93]It's just autoplay.
[257:01.24]Yes!
[257:04.90]Got it.
[257:14.33]Okay.
[257:17.33]Plant the eggnog.
[257:22.96]And that's gonna do it.
[257:37.11]Fireplace?
[257:37.65]Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[257:51.31]Look at that.
[257:51.75]Looks great.
[258:05.14]Well, it only took us about four hours.
[258:08.51]More than that, probably.
[258:09.33]Okay.
[258:19.15]Basement.
[258:19.55]Last check in the basement.
[258:24.92]What is this?
[258:25.32]Is this parts of the caravan?
[258:28.72]Yeah, it is.
[258:30.86]This is from Dead Men Tell No Tales.
[258:39.28]By the way, anybody watch Dead Men Tell No Tales?
[258:42.34]And think the whole movie that you were watching Johnny Depp do a bad Johnny Depp impression?
[258:50.14]It's weird.
[258:50.52]Alright, uh, entrance and then we're done.
[259:00.33]Forget about the one splat on the ceiling.
[259:02.73]Let, uh, the, oh.
[259:06.59]Don't do body parts.
[259:07.39]Okay, good.
[259:12.98]Alright, let's start our... Let's start our turn-in, you know?
[259:15.96]Our quest turn-in.
[259:42.11]Hit the screen.
[259:43.33]What?
[259:45.42]No, I'm just checking it out.
[259:54.80]Come on, get in.
[260:07.05]I'm gonna rack up so many points for this.
[260:10.40]Did anybody else, like, how much, what did he get for doing this?
[260:18.39]Why was that pitch shift down?
[260:21.92]Alright.
[260:23.86]So, let me, let's not track dirt everywhere, get this in here, fill it up.
[261:03.90]Only... No, it won't be long now.
[261:05.28]Just another few minutes.
[261:07.22]And yes, I did say this was going to be like a three hour stream, but I got addicted to the game.
[261:10.62]And it became like... This is a lot of fun.
[261:12.22]I'm definitely going to be playing this again.
[261:15.06]Like... This is now a clean houses channel.
[261:42.72]House Flipper DLC?
[261:45.15]What the hell was that?
[261:45.89]Oh, trash.
[261:46.59]Alright, run out of space here.
[261:49.75]I think that's the only thing left, and then it's the mop.
[261:53.56]And then we do the final pass.
[261:58.97]I don't want to... I'm going to get dirty shoes here.
[262:20.63]Oh, no.
[262:21.27]Now this is Monster Hunter: World.
[262:22.55]Okay.
[263:08.22]Alright.
[263:10.14]Just a little bit more.
[263:17.54]And we're done.
[263:52.22]Perfect.
[264:05.71]The final box to dump in the trash.
[264:09.67]I did it.
[264:13.87]He's actually blind?
[264:14.99]What are you talking about?
[264:16.64]What?
[264:20.88]Where?
[264:38.08]One guy.
[264:39.41]It's over.
[264:41.17]It's over.
[264:42.57]It's done.
[264:46.05]Merry Christmas!
[264:57.10]Why can I get this?
[265:08.82]Alright It's perfect
[265:53.68]Nothing in here?
[265:54.96]Clean.
[265:59.50]Did you clean upstairs?
[266:00.36]Oh yeah.
[266:04.55]What's wrong?
[266:04.93]Why is it doing this?
[266:05.87]Oh, because of the fucking thing on the ceiling.
[266:21.30]Okay.
[266:23.00]It's done.
[266:24.26]Take a look at this clean house.
[266:25.94]Remember what it looked like before?
[266:33.61]Ah.
[266:37.65]Look, it's so cozy.
[266:41.73]One shotgun shell?
[266:46.65]Ah, two shotgun shells, you meant to say.
[266:58.39]Ah, okay.
[267:00.91]I think we're good.
[267:03.09]It's done.
[267:05.47]Is the stool knocked over?
[267:14.36]Where?
[267:32.34]Nope, this is clean down here.
[267:43.78]Clean.
[268:15.61]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's wrong here?
[268:31.84]No, it's over here.
[268:32.54]It's like, right, it's like over here.
[268:42.69]Do I have to get rid of the TNT?
[268:53.76]No.
[268:54.96]Everything's clean in here.
[268:55.72]Whatever.
[268:56.10]Fuck it.
[268:56.40]Alright.
[268:58.08]That's it.
[268:59.56]Yay.
[268:59.86]Merry Christmas.
[269:04.24]Do I get like a score?
[269:05.08]Alright.
[269:19.93]Let's go.
[269:22.47]C minus.
[269:24.41]No buckets, no random shit everywhere.
[269:26.91]Ah, whoops.
[269:34.32]That's it?
[269:35.56]That was fun.
[269:36.28]Alright, clock out.
[269:37.06]Uh, I'm proud of my performance and certain it will meet with approval.
[269:41.62]Uh, I wish I could do more for my company.
[269:46.82]Give me some paperwork to fill out.
[269:48.44]I don't care.
[269:49.28]I'm proud of my performance.
[269:59.30]There's a weird... Okay.
[270:17.35]With your holiday joy now forever lost, you wonder if it was enough.
[270:20.25]Sure, while the thought of maybe one day earning employee of the month and picturing the shiny presence being treated with respect eases your heart, the morbid look on massacred elephant faces will haunt you for years to come.
[270:35.05]Okay.
[270:37.47]Assessment.
[270:39.97]What's my assessment?
[270:44.94]That's an A.
[270:48.26]Incident reports.
[270:49.76]IR-8 concerning Santa's workshop.
[270:52.79]What's an IR-8?
[270:53.45]IR-8?
[271:06.93]I didn't do paperwork.
[271:08.85]Blood spot on the door?
[271:12.67]So you got a little office?
[271:14.13]That's cool.
[271:15.69]What happens if I fuck up the office?
[271:17.39]Do I have to clean up my office?
[271:21.22]Oh, no, no, don't break this.
[271:22.34]I need this, probably.
[271:27.10]What the fuck happened?
[271:49.08]Certificates.
[271:50.86]Oh, that's cool.
[271:55.77]Alright, well, this is a lot... Oh, cool, that's where the sounds are coming from.
[271:59.83]Alright.
[272:01.41]Well... I left a Molotov cocktail.
[272:07.12]That's not... What?
[272:10.16]I'm gonna save.
[272:11.20]This is fucking fun.
[272:15.42]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[272:20.53]That was a lot of fun.
[272:22.77]But I do have to go.
[272:24.23]I have to.
[272:26.29]I gotta get this shit ready for Christmas Eve.
[272:31.24]We're gonna play this again.
[272:34.20]This is... I love this game.
[272:36.46]What a fun game.
[272:38.70]Time to... I'm gonna go clean my house in real life, yeah?
[272:45.63]Yeah, I was only supposed to stream for like a few hours because I have to go do package ordering and to make sure all these things can get here.
[272:56.51]Thank you, by the way, for all the suggestions.
[272:58.24]I don't know what they were, but I'm sure they will be very, very fun.
[273:03.26]Looking forward to it.
[273:06.22]Where was Shrek?
[273:06.90]I'll do that next stream.
[273:08.08]We'll play Shrek next time.
[273:14.83]I didn't think this was gonna take this long.
[273:16.19]I had too much fun dicking around.
[273:20.88]When is the stream?
[273:22.86]The stream is gonna be Christmas Eve.
[273:25.22]So I will not see you guys tomorrow.
[273:26.78]Tomorrow I'm gonna be off.
[273:27.87]I have a doctor's appointment.
[273:30.69]And I'm doing other stuff with the Christmas Eve stream, and then I'll be back on Saturday.
[273:38.60]I might just play this again on Saturday.
[273:42.08]Or maybe Atlas, if it works.
[273:44.26]Who knows?
[273:45.08]Maybe it'll get delayed again.
[273:48.58]We'll see.
[273:51.13]There's like seven or eight more campaigns that I haven't even looked at, so.
[273:58.11]But yeah, if you've taken off, thanks for hanging out.
[274:00.77]There was a shitload of community subs tonight.
[274:02.29]Thank you for those.
[274:07.23]And we're going to get to the bits.
[274:14.12]Let's go back.
[274:15.83]All the way back.
[274:16.55]About four and a half, five hours ago or so.
[274:20.47]Here we are right here.
[274:24.51]So I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[274:35.29]That was a load of fun.
[274:35.97]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.
[274:37.55]I found these berry... ...beery kicks today, and I was so happy.
[274:41.13]I haven't had berry kicks in 12 years.
[274:44.23]Also, my friend gave me French toast crunch cereal, and I just realized the sell-by date was January 11th, 2018.
[274:51.71]Should I eat it?
[274:53.98]The sell-by date?
[274:54.80]That hadn't... Oh.
[274:58.04]Oh, probably not.
[274:59.82]No, that's almost a year ago.
[275:03.89]That's gonna be stale as hell.
[275:05.07]I wouldn't do it.
[275:08.45]Lucky Charms is my favorite cereal.
[275:12.27]It's... I love it.
[275:18.39]Captain Crunch, Lucky Charms.
[275:19.55]They're great.
[275:20.09]Especially Lucky Charms.

[276:03.17]Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, for the one dollar.
[276:05.45]This game is probably more traumatizing than that birdhouse story I told a while back.
[276:09.11]I don't know, that was a pretty traumatizing story.
[276:13.76]That was a really traumatizing story.
[276:18.94]Bonjour.

[278:49.76]I don't want... no.

[278:55.99]No, you gotta clean your own, like, toilet.
[278:58.07]You know what I mean?
[278:58.65]I'm weird like that.
[279:00.83]I have to clean my own toilet and no one else can do that.
[279:09.31]What if I shit in my oven?

[280:37.75]I'm watching Seinfeld for the first time today from beginning to end.
[280:40.63]I've never really sat down and appreciated it.
[280:42.27]I love it so far.
[280:45.31]Well, I got news for you.
[280:46.85]If you like Seinfeld, if you actually think it's funny, Curb Your Enthusiasm is, in my opinion, is a superior program.
[281:00.89]I like Seinfeld.
[281:02.37]I don't like the studio audience thing, though.
[281:05.05]I never have.
[281:09.69]But Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm is especially... Especially Curb Your Enthusiasm starts off kind of slow.
[281:18.44]You're going to be like, this is not funny.
[281:19.62]You're going to watch the first four episodes and go, I don't like this.
[281:22.18]This is stupid.
[281:23.47]Don't.
[281:23.81]Don't do that.
[281:25.42]You got seasons like two through eight of Curb Your Enthusiasm is some of the most hilarious television I've probably ever watched.
[281:43.00]Every first season of a TV show.
[281:45.93]Is weak.
[281:46.57]I stopped in the first season, Hypo?
[281:48.09]Yeah, but that's what I mean.
[281:50.07]The first, especially the first couple episodes, is just... Like, oh, there's like two guys kind of arguing with each other.
[281:56.88]That's like the whole episode.
[281:57.84]Okay, well... There's so much more after that first season, especially the first few episodes.
[282:07.75]Skip the first season?
[282:08.59]No, you can't.
[282:12.21]Is it on Amazon Prime?
[282:14.07]No, I think it's on HBO.
[282:16.82]If you have HBO Now or HBO Go.
[282:19.84]If it is on Amazon Prime, that's actually pretty cool.
[282:24.06]It is.
[282:24.53]Well, more reason to just watch it while it's there.
[282:31.85]It's a great show.
[282:35.69]Thank you, Blumpkin... Did I actually just...
[282:43.68]Thank you for the one dollar.
[282:45.90]Fuck.

[282:50.76]Whatever.

[282:55.72]Why did I say that?
[282:56.50]I don't know.
[282:56.78]I just read the name.
[282:57.88]I just read.
[282:58.94]I read name.
[283:02.56]Why?
[283:02.88]I... It's alright.
[283:06.10]Don't worry about it.
[283:06.94]It's gonna be fine.
[283:09.24]It's gonna be okay.

[283:50.32]And then I diarrhea every single morning.
[283:57.07]I pulled it off.
[284:02.61]Well... I mean, I did say that at one point.

[284:15.85]And that was a disgusting video.

[285:22.03]That's kind of how I felt about it.
[285:29.52]You got good dental?
[285:30.76]Yeah, sometimes.
[285:37.41]Hey, thank you, but thank you so much for $5 and hashtag charity as well.
[285:41.84]Captain Morgan, thanks for the $1.
[285:42.88]Do you dream of Twitch chat?
[285:45.51]I've had dreams of Twitch chat before.
[285:49.16]I actually think I've had a dream before where I was sleeping, just in my bed, and I was just seeing kind of the chat on the right side of just me, like, you know, I'm lying there with my eyes closed, like, it's all black, and I just see Twitch chat on the right, and it's just like, he doesn't know, he doesn't know, what the fuck, oh my god, what an idiot, somebody text him, anybody have, like, it was that, just spamming.
[286:14.41]And there were like 30 or 40,000 concurrent people there.
[286:17.65]And I was like, wait a minute, hold on.
[286:18.71]I had like an internal panic.
[286:19.63]I'm like, wait, I'm sleeping.
[286:20.51]They're watching me sleep?
[286:21.89]How did I leave the stream on?
[286:23.35]I'm sleeping.
[286:28.37]And then I realized what was happening.
[286:29.68]But that's probably the only time it's happened.
[286:35.86]Because then I'm thinking about like, do I have any clothes on?
[286:38.02]Like, how many people are here?
[286:39.06]What's going on?
[286:41.84]Why is the stream on?
[286:43.14]And why am I asleep?
[286:45.14]What's going on?
[286:48.94]But yeah, pretty much.
[286:51.60]I don't think so.
[286:52.44]Uh... I've never played a Persona game before, and I feel like starting at Persona 5 is the equivalent of... watching... Like... Like watching Star Wars.
[287:15.32]That's like watching the new Star Wars movie.
[287:17.56]Before you even have- Oh, what's Star Wars?
[287:19.28]I guess I'll watch this episode seven.
[287:23.36]You can't really do that.
[287:27.77]It doesn't matter.
[287:35.39]So they're not connected at all.
[287:37.79]They're all self-contained, except for the first two.
[287:40.41]Oh.
[287:42.30]Oh, okay.
[287:44.55]Oh, there goes one of the reasons then.
[287:53.17]I actually saw on the PS4 store when I was browsing... There's a Persona 5 dance game.
[288:01.51]Because that's what I thought it was at first.
[288:02.75]It was like, Persona 5!
[288:04.33]Dance in the starlight!
[288:05.39]Or something.
[288:05.73]And I'm like, why do people like this game so much?
[288:09.18]It's like, is there like a... This is like RPG, but it's just like a dancing simulator.
[288:13.62]I thought that's what Persona 5 was.
[288:18.44]Because it's Persona 5, like, colon, here's like a little tagline.
[288:22.85]I was like, okay, that's Persona 5.
[288:31.11]So how, so there's a, there's also, I saw Persona 4, like, dancing with the stars, right?
[288:44.50]Because I got really confused when I watched the trailer.
[288:47.86]Everybody's like, oh, you gotta play Persona 5.
[288:49.90]It's got such an engrossing story.
[288:51.72]It's like such an interesting game.
[288:53.38]It's so great.
[288:54.13]Oh, Joker!
[288:55.57]And then I'm watching this trailer for... People just... It's like a... It's like a DDR.
[289:00.11]I'm like, this is what... Okay.
[289:09.96]But I guess... I mean, I've seen Persona 3 be played.
[289:15.07]And it was pretty interesting.
[289:16.77]I've never played them myself, though.
[289:20.63]But, I don't know.
[289:22.63]Hey, Radio Vidya, thanks for the $1, Jerma.
[289:24.63]We will watch whatever you stream, because we love you.
[289:27.62]Though stuff like Chrono Trigger would be good for chill streams.
[289:32.52]Yeah, I know.
[289:38.34]I probably will end up playing it.
[289:41.54]I probably would stream it.
[289:45.68]It's a great game.
[289:48.18]But... Alas.
[289:51.07]I would watch it.
[289:51.93]Well, that's good.
[289:54.33]IamMonk, thanks for the $1.72.
[289:55.91]Can't give subs, but here's some bits.
[289:59.23]Jeremy Hart, hashtag charity.
[290:02.49]Nobody is ever under any obligation to buy gift subs or pay...
[290:11.24]It's solely up to you.
[290:13.04]You don't have to... It's not like, oh, I have to.
[290:16.08]Don't worry about it.
[290:17.00]Thank you so much for being here, and thanks for the $1.72.
[290:18.34]All mew, thanks for the two bucks.
[290:22.56]Epic janitor spill jokes.
[290:26.85]It happens so many times.
[290:28.29]Alright, so, like, help me some slack here, guys.
[290:31.25]Do you really honestly think that I would... Oh, yeah, I have a good funny idea for a joke.
[290:36.73]I'm gonna spill the bucket over accidentally.
[290:40.65]I mean, okay, sure, but if that happens, like, two or three hundred times, do you think that at, like, time number three hundred, I'm like, here we go, here comes a funny thing I'm gonna do.
[290:52.70]Yeah, this would be funny when I do this.
[290:57.02]After, like, two hundred times?
[291:05.51]No, I'm not...
[291:10.54]There are certain things that maybe I would potentially, not tonight, but yeah, sure, like, when I'm playing Red Dead, oh, I'm gonna try to, like, time it so I can, like, run into the train, like, right?
[291:20.49]And we all know that that's happening, and I tried a few times, and I can't do it, right?
[291:25.07]But I don't, like, plan.
[291:27.11]Whoops, I tripped!
[291:28.51]I gotta plan that one.
[291:32.27]You're unfunny like that.
[291:37.23]That's the same thing, the fall off the horse thing.
[291:41.21]Do you think I'm making a joke after 75 times?
[291:54.47]It's funny because I played Red Dead Redemption 2
[291:59.01]Like two nights ago when I wasn't streaming, I was just hanging out on the couch.
[292:02.79]And I fell off more times than when I was streaming.
[292:06.96]And I remember laughing to myself, going like, man, if only people were watching this, they would be like, holy shit.
[292:18.39]Without us?
[292:18.79]Without us?
[292:24.02]Yeah, maybe I would stream Red Dead again, but I'm just having fun just slowly going through on my own.
[292:35.83]You betrayed us.
[292:45.23]No, I streamed Red Dead like five times.
[292:49.09]I played about 30 or 40% of that entire game on stream.
[292:55.72]I didn't do the whole thing, but I mean, it's a long game.
[292:59.87]He thinks we aren't watching.
[293:01.41]Hey, man boy, thanks for the $1.
[293:04.15]Here you go.
[293:04.65]There's a link here.
[293:07.45]Okay, here you go.
[293:46.01]Never gonna give you up.
[293:48.05]Never gonna say no.
[293:50.13]Never gonna say goodbye.
[293:52.25]Never gonna say goodbye.
[293:54.31]Never gonna say a lie or dis... You ruined my favorite song.
[294:04.34]Hey, The Spaz!

[294:12.88]It's a Christmas gift.

[294:41.62]Uh... An egg beater.
[294:55.62]Oh, well, that was pretty good.
[295:06.44]Thank you, Versimno, for the $1 hashtag charity.
[295:09.46]Thank you.
[295:11.42]Ike Turtle, thanks for the $1.
[295:12.75]Hey, just thought I'd donate to my favorite top 1,000 streamer.
[295:16.63]Nice to see you finally made it to the B tier.
[295:19.95]And that's all I ever need to be.
[295:23.55]B is perfect where it is.
[295:27.08]I'm totally cool with a B grade.
[295:30.54]Anyway, I'm excited about the Christmas Eve stream.
[295:32.20]Also, that makes eight now.
[295:36.04]Italsmug, hashtag charity.
[295:37.90]Eight what?
[295:42.95]Thank you, Ike, though.
[295:43.59]Appreciate it.
[295:44.35]What is this?
[295:53.29]This is what I just did.
[295:54.25]Never gonna give you up.
[296:05.84]Never gonna say no.
[296:07.92]Never gonna say goodbye.
[296:10.04]Never gonna say goodbye.
[296:12.08]Never gonna say.
[296:13.46]Say.
[296:14.28]Say.
[296:14.94]Never gonna say.
[296:15.81]No, that's flat.
[296:18.19]Never gonna say.
[296:19.63]There it is.
[296:20.77]Replace it.
[296:30.54]Somebody mix that in and replace it, please.
[296:35.14]Hey, Goffy, the Monday killer, thanks for the $1.
[296:38.96]Hey Jerm, ain't the Christmas season just Garfy?
[296:41.08]Spider-Man has quite the year, hasn't he?
[296:43.52]Great PlayStation 4 game, an awesome animated movie, and a big role in Infinity War.
[296:48.38]What a Garftacular year for Marvel as a whole.
[296:51.18]Once upon a Deadpool is given a dollar of every ticket sold to charities to stopping cancer.
[296:55.44]Plus there was a heartfelt after-credits scene with Stan Lee.
[297:00.90]Brought a tear to my eye.
[297:01.72]Gotta remember the importance of comics and the guys behind them.
[297:04.10]Jerm a heart.
[297:04.90]Absolutely.
[297:11.46]Yeah.
[297:14.28]Stan Lee created pretty much almost every single thing you think is cool.
[297:22.71]So.
[297:26.79]Rest in peace.
[297:40.89]But thank you, Garfield, that was a very nice, uh, very nice comment there.
[297:47.23]Oh, man, if you like Ashen.
[297:48.15]Oh, boy.
[298:09.85]If you've never played a Souls game before, you've got a lot to go through.
[298:20.60]But I think Ashen would have to sit sort of on the back burner.
[298:25.76]Because that's a big commitment, isn't it?
[298:28.06]It's a... Is it a long game?
[298:30.70]Was it like 30 hours or something like that?
[298:32.03]20, 30, 40 hours?
[298:33.23]Or is it short?
[298:42.96]20 hours.
[298:45.84]Yeah, but I'd probably sit on the back burner.
[298:47.16]I don't have any plans for it.
[298:49.06]Not in the immediate future, but it is always there.
[298:51.29]That's the one thing about... Great thing about video games.
[298:54.81]They're always available.
[298:59.19]So if it's ever like, what am I gonna play next week?
[299:01.33]Hmm.
[299:02.77]I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[299:04.03]Oh, okay.
[299:05.43]Let's just dream Ashen.
[299:08.13]Hydrate, hydrate.
[299:08.83]I already did.
[299:10.77]I did, I did.
[299:11.19]Don't worry.
[299:13.17]See, look.
[299:19.00]But thank you, Parfolivew.
[299:21.24]Thank you, CozyBrother, for the $4.
[299:22.50]No, uh, no message?
[299:25.90]Just $4, thank you.
[299:28.21]Bunnybutt, thanks for the $1.
[299:29.15]I have finals week, please.
[299:33.25]Yeah, you guys have finals week.
[299:34.45]Some of you have already taken them.
[299:36.73]Some of you still have to wait, but good luck.
[299:39.86]Mr. Pigeon, thanks for the $1.
[299:42.02]Hey, Jerma.
[299:42.69]Congrats on the news about the pregnancy.
[299:44.71]Time flies super fast.
[299:45.51]It feels like yesterday you introduced yourself.
[299:47.89]Us.
[299:48.87]Uh... No, this ain't real.
[299:50.73]No, this is not real.
[299:51.43]This is not real.
[299:51.97]Don't... This is a funny... Like, he knocked the bucket over 150 times, right?
[299:57.53]It's one of those.
[299:58.67]I forget what they're called again.
[299:59.47]Um... It starts with J. I don't know.
[300:04.40]Hey, C4G, thanks for the $1.
[300:06.36]If you hold a bucket under yourself and jump, you can glitch off of it and fly.
[300:10.96]Oh, I missed that one.
[300:13.80]But thank you, C4G.
[300:16.28]Thank you, FaceInCake, for the $5.
[300:18.14]Uh, there's another USB on the upstairs table, you fuck.
[300:26.62]Now you re-ex- no, you rearrange those last three words, and you got- now you're talking my language there.
[300:33.13]Uh, fuck you table.
[300:35.48]Talked about that before the stream started.
[300:40.98]That's one of my favorite things.
[300:43.04]Thanks for the $5 face and cake.
[300:44.63]Thank you, eDragon, for the $5.
[300:46.73]Hashtag charity.
[300:48.19]Thank you.
[300:50.63]Really appreciate it.
[300:54.99]Thank you, Bunnybutt, for the $2.
[300:55.94]Wanted to say thank you, Jerma.
[300:57.96]Today was hard.
[300:59.36]Having a rough time with life, but it's always amazing to relax with one of your streams.
[301:03.22]You're amazingly uplifting.
[301:04.44]Hope to see you more.
[301:08.53]I'm really sorry to hear that you're having a rough time.
[301:15.35]Glad you can relax and fuck around and chat, crack a few jokes, and hang out.
[301:25.68]That is what I care about, number one.
[301:29.80]But thank you so much for the two dollars, sir.
[301:33.22]Hey, the true Meechie, thanks for the one dollar.
[301:36.08]I bet you didn't forget that you said you will hit me up on Discord eight months ago.
[301:43.87]Well, my brain, um... I kind of scatter it, so...
[301:53.88]He'll look into it.
[301:54.54]I've done that before.
[301:57.68]It's just, I'm so... bad.
[302:01.77]You know, it took me, it took me, like... There's a guy in the stream, in chat, and he hangs out a lot.
[302:09.19]He was a college roommate of mine.
[302:12.53]And... He, like, he proved it.
[302:15.21]It was real.
[302:16.95]And it took me, like, four to five straight months to remember.
[302:20.16]Oh, okay!
[302:23.73]And we, like, actually talked.
[302:25.55]So... I am sorry.
[302:28.67]I'm very sorry.
[302:29.49]It's just my... I scatter myself around.
[302:32.61]And I lose track very, very easily.
[302:37.68]It is not intentional.
[302:40.18]It's just sometimes, like, something else will come up over here.
[302:41.86]Something else will come up over there.
[302:42.68]I have something else.
[302:44.14]Something will enter my brain and push out everything else.
[302:46.32]And it's actually a really bad thing.
[302:52.51]But yes, I know there are at least two... I think there are at least one or two people that I do need to get in touch with, so... I'm actually going to check exactly that when the stream ends, so... It's okay, I'm just making it funny.
[303:20.21]I will be there in July 2019 to say the exact same thing.
[303:24.27]No, no, that's not gonna happen.
[303:25.97]Once I, like, remember and get on it, usually I get on it.
[303:30.13]But it is one of my flaws.
[303:32.33]And I do apologize for it.
[303:38.28]But thank you for the $1, and thank you for reminding me.
[303:41.82]Uh, thank you, um... Nitsu... Kitty...
[303:49.47]For the $5.
[303:51.71]Thanks so much for the stream today.
[303:52.67]Haven't laughed that hard in a while.
[303:53.77]I appreciate it.
[303:57.63]Thanks for hanging out.
[303:59.23]I had a lot of fun.
[304:00.09]It was a blast.
[304:02.39]Hey, BusterBoy, thank you for the $1.
[304:05.01]Jerma, just don't play Mother 3.
[304:06.53]It's such a boring game, you wouldn't enjoy it.
[304:11.70]Do we have a one-guy versus one-guy scenario here?
[304:16.42]I think so.
[304:20.91]Because I think... This is tough.
[304:27.66]This is 1v1, one guy.
[304:30.92]Hmm.
[304:36.85]Play mode of three.
[304:37.53]There you go.
[304:38.11]I'm the second guy.
[304:39.17]I don't know if I would do it on stream.
[304:44.51]RPGs, I just... I don't know if I would do them on stream.
[304:50.28]I can't commit to that and be able to say, yes, I'll do Mother 1, 2, I'm going to play Earthbound, and then Mother 3.
[305:05.29]What's the famous quote that I'm about to say right now?
[305:10.55]I'll look into it.
[305:14.55]I'm going to look into that.
[305:18.63]PK Fire!

[306:55.90]That's I Thank you I don't really want to I don't know if I want to agree with that because I
[307:13.65]Anytime that I start to think that, I'm the best.
[307:18.07]I'm the best on Twitch.
[307:21.10]Then I feel like I would start to degrade in quality.
[307:24.08]I feel like I would be like, that's it.
[307:25.78]I did it.
[307:26.30]I'm the best.
[307:28.37]And I don't want to do that.
[307:40.94]I really, really appreciate the fact that you think that.
[307:45.94]But I... I... I'm floored that people think that.
[307:50.21]There's so many people that stream here.
[307:52.75]There are thou- There are like... How many people are streaming right now?

[309:08.60]Leon adds so much to the show, and it just bakes everything.
[309:12.84]Everything is so funny.

[310:22.13]And away they all ran.
[310:23.67]Like the down of a thistle.
[310:25.03]But I heard him scream as he drove out of eating ass.
[310:30.13]What?
[310:32.44]Yo, Merry Christmas.
[310:33.22]Take care.
[310:33.74]What?

[312:37.57]It makes me feel like an old grandma when I say, seeing you move to Vegas, rent out studios, and follow your entertainment dreams makes me really happy.
[312:45.68]You seem so satisfied with what you are accomplishing, and that rubs off onto your audience.
[312:50.26]Keep doing what you love.

[313:09.45]If that rubs off on you, then apps are fucking literally.
[313:20.00]No matter what it is.
[313:20.78]Doesn't matter what it is.
[313:22.52]And I'm not even talking about just entertainment shit.
[313:24.13]I'm not talking about just like, oh, like... Being like an actor or like a... A writer.
[313:29.97]No, I'm just... Every single... Aspect of your life.
[313:34.99]Whatever it is.
[313:42.49]Eating ass.
[313:43.73]Sure.
[313:44.34]Yeah.
[313:44.74]If you want to be the best ass eater in the world...
[313:48.52]Alright!
[313:49.17]That's... Go for it!
[314:00.88]Mood ruined.
[314:04.82]But that's Jerma's title.
[314:06.46]Yeah, and I don't think you're gonna be able to beat it.
[314:10.09]Why am I still doing this?
[314:11.19]Why am I pushing this bullshit?
[314:19.16]Because you see a button and you have to press it.
[314:20.74]You hear a phone ringing and it could be anyone.
[314:22.06]But a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
[314:44.74]Remember that movie?
[314:46.58]Now you stay right there and don't get out of that phone booth.
[314:48.87]Don't you move from that phone booth or I'll do it.
[315:01.57]Look at all these subs.
[315:02.99]Look at all these names.
[315:03.77]Look at all these people that have subscribed.
[315:05.43]You guys are fucking amazing.
[315:11.61]Thank you so much, everybody.
[315:16.29]I will see you all on Saturday.
[315:25.31]Thank you for all your suggestions to the secret kind of chat Santa thing.
[315:34.20]That should be a lot of fun.
[315:35.92]I'll see you Saturday.
[315:37.00]We'll do something fun.
[315:38.70]We got a couple of options.
[315:41.38]Have a great rest of your evening.
[315:43.51]Have a great rest of your tomorrow.
[315:47.04]See you soon.
[316:06.35]Thank you, Double D, for that.
[316:08.05]What did I do?
[316:09.03]Oh, I said somebody's name.
[316:10.39]Alright, I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[316:13.45]Goodbye.
[316:30.59]Wait, Dr. Clay got skipped for $1.
[316:32.43]I wasn't attempting to make you say anything.
[316:33.78]I was just trying to rhyme ass with Christmas.
[316:37.56]Oh.
[316:38.20]Okay.
[316:43.01]I get it now.
[316:45.95]Alright.
[316:46.47]Good night, everybody.
