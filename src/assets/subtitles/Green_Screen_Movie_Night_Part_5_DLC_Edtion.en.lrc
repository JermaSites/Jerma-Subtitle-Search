[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.78]Good morning.
[00:02.14]How you doing?
[00:09.91]Remember the golden rule of this channel.
[00:11.69]If one minute has gone by and Jerma does not say something, he's dead.
[00:17.83]It's a golden rule here.
[00:18.85]If a full minute has passed, he has not spoken.
[00:24.16]He's dead.
[00:26.22]He had to have died.
[00:28.34]It's true.
[00:31.06]Hey, how you doing everybody?
[00:32.26]Welcome to the stream.
[00:32.94]We're going to do DLC Movie Night Part 2.
[00:38.30]We have well over 100 plus more videos to watch.
[00:42.57]Told you last weekend we were going to do it exactly one full week from, you know, there.
[00:47.99]Here we are.
[00:51.34]I have to apologize because of yesterday.
[00:53.36]Those of you that were watching the stream yesterday, the power went out.
[01:02.42]And I didn't come back for a pretty long fucking time.
[01:07.18]So sorry about the power going out.
[01:09.10]And I couldn't even reply to you guys.
[01:11.32]I couldn't even get in there.
[01:14.18]Because it killed my, obviously it killed my modem.
[01:17.90]My router.
[01:18.99]So I was just on data.
[01:19.97]Like just phone data.
[01:22.45]And when the power goes out somewhere, it kills everybody's router.
[01:27.71]So every single person in this entire area, all at the same time, switched to data mode and called somebody.
[01:37.42]So I'm trying to get in line in the data queue at the tower, and I'm trying to tell you guys, hey, the power... I don't even know if it went through.
[01:47.40]It's like when you land in an airplane.
[01:50.41]And you land, and everybody... Ding!
[01:52.41]Okay, every fucking phone comes up in the seat the second you land.
[01:56.22]And it's like, wait, why do I have no service?
[01:58.28]No, I'm trying to get through.
[01:59.80]Can you hear me?
[02:00.18]Hello?
[02:00.46]Okay, times that by like 50,000.
[02:02.93]That's not how it works.
[02:09.35]It is.
[02:10.67]In my head.
[02:11.39]So that's what it is.
[02:12.11]Hmm, never thought about it like that.
[02:20.56]Yeah.
[02:22.16]Guys, you still have to connect to something.
[02:24.00]Do you know how the infrastructure works?
[02:27.27]It's not a magic trick.
[02:29.45]You have to connect to the tower.
[02:32.19]And if like 10,000 connections go to the same time to the tower, you're gonna... Sorry.
[02:37.35]You don't get to go.
[02:39.67]You get a call drop.
[02:41.80]You get the... 5G.
[02:49.58]What about 5G?
[02:50.42]Yeah, who knows?
[02:50.98]Maybe 5G will solve this problem.
[02:54.58]Frog damp moment.
[03:00.94]Alright.
[03:04.88]This is a frog damp moment, apparently.
[03:11.13]Hold on, let me show it.
[03:14.07]Yeah, we're gonna stall a little bit, because I want people to get in here, because people want to watch this stuff.
[03:20.05]I'm not gonna be like, hey guys, welcome to stream!
[03:22.13]Oh, video!
[03:24.75]No, we're gonna wait.
[03:25.73]You gotta wait like a minute or two.
[03:27.29]Five minutes.
[03:33.68]Hurry up.
[03:34.78]It's... We just... I just... No.
[03:36.94]You hurry up.
[03:38.40]And sit down.
[03:40.75]You hurry up and sit down for a little bit.
[03:50.13]That haircut and that, like... Ugh.
[03:55.93]Peasant NPC.
[03:57.11]It really is.
[03:57.79]It sucks how much of a peasant NPC this is.
[04:08.51]Make it an emote?
[04:09.55]No, it already is an emote.
[04:14.42]You just jump scared?
[04:15.36]Alright, I'm gonna move.
[04:22.32]Well, okay.
[04:22.72]Are you ready?
[04:23.15]It's been five minutes.
[04:26.12]Am I going to play Custom Robo again?
[04:28.32]Probably.
[04:29.72]I feel like we were just starting to get into it.
[04:32.35]The worst part about when your power goes out... This is the worst thing about power going out.
[04:38.69]You think that your house may have exploded.
[04:41.61]Right?
[04:42.66]So you're just sitting there.
[04:43.46]I was mid-sentence.
[04:45.28]I got monitors on.
[04:46.36]I got an AC running.
[04:48.90]And all of a sudden, like, a light is on and you just... What happened?
[04:53.12]Am I dead?
[04:53.54]Did something explode?
[04:54.46]No.
[04:54.92]Okay, what happened?
[04:55.52]Oh, the power's gone.
[04:58.15]It's when you don't... And this is when nothing happened at all.
[05:01.33]Wait, there's a big snowstorm.
[05:03.07]Oh, tons of rain.
[05:04.47]Something must have... Oh, weather.
[05:05.93]No.
[05:07.29]You're just sitting around and there's nothing wrong.
[05:17.04]Okay, yes.
[05:20.38]Every power outage is personalized.
[05:22.62]Yeah, it was weird.
[05:31.15]And then you start freaking out because it starts turning back on and off and on and off over and over again.
[05:36.55]And then you run around like a psychopath, unplugging everything in your whole house.
[05:41.47]Oh, fuck.
[05:47.27]Fuck, I gotta plug that thing up.
[05:48.77]That thing's toast.
[05:50.68]And then I smell something.
[05:51.98]Something's burning.
[05:52.46]I smell electricity.
[05:54.20]He's like, you're fine.
[05:58.71]I unplug everything.
[06:03.03]What's the matter with him?
[06:05.67]That's the power going on and off.
[06:09.27]And then he starts smelling electricity.
[06:10.58]Yeah, I freak out.
[06:11.54]Guys, I don't even like to use the oven.
[06:14.72]I think the oven's scary.
[06:16.50]Are you really this surprised that I don't like power outages?
[06:20.56]I'm like a small dog in personality.
[06:25.38]Do I know what it is?
[06:27.26]Cool.
[06:27.64]I love it.
[06:28.92]Does something startle me?
[06:30.79]Did you walk into the house with my favorite toy and costume?
[06:34.25]Did you walk into the house with a Gumby outfit on?
[06:35.95]Are you going to freak me out?
[06:42.91]Anyways, let's watch the movie.
[06:46.43]The literal man child.
[06:47.82]No, I'm a literal dog child.

[06:53.30]But not in the sense that you, like, not, oh, he's like a furry.
[06:55.72]No, no, no, I'm a dog man.
[06:58.26]I have a dog brain.
[06:59.38]There you go.
[07:03.52]No, I'm not a dog.
[07:05.64]I'm not an anthropomorphic dog.

[10:09.15]I just took a full sip of water and like laughed internally and just almost exploded my head.
[10:16.56]I almost just did what happened in the video when it happened in the video.
[10:22.66]Look at the painting.
[10:26.91]Look at the... Alright, alright, alright.
[10:28.83]I'll go over this really quickly.
[10:31.67]I'm going to go over this very quickly.

[10:37.52]Look, this could be real.
[10:38.88]I don't know.
[10:39.36]But apparently this is the Chuck E. Cheese stock price the day that I streamed and Chuck E. Cheese came in.
[10:49.36]Is this apparently real?
[10:50.40]I don't know.
[10:51.08]I have nothing to do with this.
[10:52.21]I don't know.

[15:06.31]What am I drinking?
[15:07.37]That is, uh, water with a little bit of lemon in it.
[15:12.20]Just gives it just enough for a little bit of kick.

[16:00.79]It leads from here.
[16:08.07]A little bit of lemon in it.
[16:11.48]This gives it just enough of a little bit of kick.
[16:15.28]Oh my god!
[16:17.92]The best part is when you edited my head going all the way backwards.

[22:10.79]I want to spend some time there.
[22:12.45]I want to learn the language, I guess.
[22:13.93]I was trying to say learn the culture.
[22:32.84]This is fucking stupid.
[22:45.85]That could have been TOS.

[27:39.88]Take this thing out of my fucking hands before I freak out.
[27:42.54]There's just one piece with somebody else that I am not ready to say goodbye to yet.
[27:56.61]I think that there's just a better fit for us out there.
[28:05.53]I have to get the fuck out of here.
[28:10.77]That was awesome.
[28:13.05]Oh, yes!
[28:13.58]A baseball one!
[28:15.86]I can't wait to hit like two home runs.
[28:18.46]The unfortunate Jermar... Jermariner's game.
[28:24.62]Jermariner's.
[28:35.35]This is not a baseball one.
[28:36.85]I'm not hitting a grand slam.
[28:38.01]What is this?
[28:38.67]This is bullshit.
[28:42.26]Why are they going so far?
[28:49.93]He's catching his own ball?
[29:11.67]It's out of the park.
[29:49.43]Fuck is going- Are they on different- Are we on different teams?
[29:52.43]Oh shit!
[29:56.33]Yeah, funny.
[30:28.54]Holy shit.
[30:32.51]That was absolutely insane.
[30:35.91]I need like a minute just to process the last one.
[30:40.43]So there's three teams?
[30:45.25]Team one was white and then gray and then bread?
[30:48.81]There was only two teams?
[30:50.05]No, it was the umpire.
[30:51.23]Okay.
[30:51.49]That was nuts.
[30:56.37]One was the ref.
[30:59.19]Can't wait to do the baseball stream.
[31:00.52]It's going to be so much fun.
[31:02.22]I can't wait.
[31:06.37]You like my hair today?
[31:07.63]It's funny you mention that because I sat down here like an hour ago and I had mustache hair.
[31:15.32]So I was like, how the, I can't get it to ever do what I want it to.
[31:17.84]So I wet my hair and just buried the comb in and just went over, over, over, over, over.
[31:23.78]And then I sat down and went, okay, that looks okay.
[31:25.72]In about an hour, remember this, in like an hour or two, all roads lead back to mustache hair.
[31:31.76]As you see, it's already forming.
[31:33.78]You see that, do you see it forming already?
[31:37.51]All roads lead to mustache hair.
[31:39.23]All.
[31:40.64]I'll check back in a little bit.
[31:41.56]We'll see.
[31:46.08]This is a German ghost to the mayor.
[31:54.86]Okay, let's see what we have here.
[31:57.94]Mayor?
[31:58.70]Michael?
[31:59.79]Ring-a-ting-a-tick-tock, tick-tock-tock.
[32:01.83]Ring, ring-a-ding-ding, ring-a-ding-ding.
[32:04.71]Rick-a-dick, Rick, Rick-a-dick-dick.
[32:06.51]Ring-a-ding-a-ding-ding-dong.
[32:08.39]Rim, rim, rim, rim.
[32:10.21]What's up, Michael?
[32:14.08]They tell me you're a doctor of energy now.
[32:16.02]Yeah, it's a great gig, and you are not going to believe the company car they just gave me.
[32:20.84]Not a LeBaron.
[32:22.08]Oh, watch this show, by the way.
[32:23.24]Ring-a-ting-a-tick-tock.
[32:26.27]I mean, you probably have no idea what the fuck's going on, but I think that's... Okay, so... What the hell is this?
[32:42.64]So, Tom Goes to the Mayor is Tim and Eric's first real show that they really had on TV.
[32:50.70]It's worth watching.
[32:51.96]They had a lot of just random celebrity guests that would just show up.
[32:55.08]It was pretty cool.
[32:55.46]It was really fun.
[32:58.98]Alright, what is this?
[32:59.68]Jim escaped.
[32:59.98]This better be transformative or I'm going to be upset about this.
[33:03.42]Is this an ad?
[33:03.94]I don't know.
[33:23.88]Didn't we already see this one?
[33:32.52]That's good enough.
[33:35.02]Go higher?
[33:40.62]Don't skip it!
[33:41.62]What?!
[33:47.20]Wait, what?
[33:48.04]Why were the begin- Hold on.
[33:49.38]How did I get to the beginning of the playlist?
[33:55.14]What button did I press?
[33:56.14]What did I do?
[33:59.94]What did I do?
[34:00.34]Did I press, like, did I freak out and press, like, the start over button?
[34:12.92]Alright, we're good, we're good.
[34:13.68]Hold on, where are we?
[34:22.44]Um...
[34:25.69]I think that video was removed from the playlist when I clicked on it.
[34:32.45]Yeah, it's gone.
[34:41.32]It's not here anymore.
[34:42.32]I'll prove it.
[34:43.46]Ready?
[34:43.72]This is Germ Goes to the Mayor.
[34:48.30]Okay, you ready?
[34:50.10]Germ Goes to the Mayor?

[35:51.21]There's been, like, ten of those, too.
[35:53.77]Is that a spoiler saying that, like, oh, Jason Voorhees is Mr. Voorhees and he kills people at the camp?
[36:00.60]He does that in every movie.
[36:01.76]Guess what?
[36:02.08]In Saw, he's gonna, like, carve up somebody's head.
[36:05.00]He's gonna, like, stuff somebody's brain full of, like, either brain and shit.

[49:55.75]Nice and smooth.
[49:56.59]Smooth.
[50:07.87]I know, I love left-hand turns.
[50:10.45]Maybe I should try going right.
[50:12.37]But I can't.
[50:13.83]I've always gone left.
[50:15.48]I always go in a big square.
[50:18.38]I can't, okay, this time.
[50:19.82]This time, you can do it.
[50:21.04]You can go right.

[51:20.67]Uh-huh.
[51:22.47]I punched a car and it crushed in front of me.
[51:25.04]I think I might have superpowers.
[51:30.58]No, don't tell the government about that.
[51:35.42]OK.
[51:36.92]OK, have fun.
[51:42.42]That was really unfunny.
[51:45.98]I really wish I knew how to delete things off that thing.
[51:47.66]That was terrible.
[51:48.40]Don't use that.
[51:49.44]Don't use, don't use any of that.
[51:50.92]Don't even, don't even bother.
[51:53.86]Is this another actor?

[52:17.88]I don't remember what the number one rule is.
[52:19.70]I said it like an hour ago.
[52:20.70]What is it?
[52:24.86]You didn't say... Yeah, I talked about like the... Yeah, okay.
[52:27.64]No sport... No.
[52:31.45]You actually didn't say what the number one rule was.
[52:34.19]I did.
[52:38.21]I talked about the number one thing.
[52:41.36]Alright, well, the number two thing is you're not allowed to be a better actor than me on my own stream.
[52:47.86]You said there are new rules.
[52:49.24]Oh, right.
[52:49.84]Okay.
[52:50.12]Well, rule two.

[66:23.88]Okay, I had no idea what was going on until about a minute and 45 seconds in.
[66:29.90]Guys, I even thought that this person, this is supposed to be, oh, topless.
[66:39.84]Yes, right.
[66:42.75]This is, I made this movie.
[66:45.15]How long ago was that, though?
[66:47.73]If it was more than a year ago, it doesn't exist.
[66:49.69]In my brain.
[66:53.05]Like three, five years ago.
[66:54.39]Four, yeah.
[66:55.11]Oh, yeah.

[69:12.90]Oh, I forgot.
[69:17.67]Yeah!
[69:40.64]Chair, okay.
[69:41.04]I remember the chair.
[70:41.16]That was accurate.
[70:54.25]Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to incorporate a final testament to this man, this wonderful man that lies before us.
[71:07.44]His name was Harold Splunk, and he was my best friend.
[71:11.54]Can somebody turn that fucking music off, please?
[71:18.13]Thank you.
[71:20.30]As I was saying, Harold was a good friend of mine.
[71:22.58]Lost my heart, hope to die, I promise that's real.
[71:24.66]And I'm just gonna miss him so fucking much.
[71:28.51]I'm gonna miss him more than anything.
[71:31.37]And then, by the way, after this I'll see you at Friday's for two set wings.
[71:37.79]This is fucking awful.
[71:39.98]That was the joke.
[71:40.88]This is fucking terrible.
[71:42.66]This is the worst one ever.
[71:44.42]It really kind of was.
[71:45.32]This is the worst one.
[71:52.07]That was the worst fucking one.
[71:56.73]Yeah.
[71:57.77]That was probably the worst one.
[72:02.58]Moving on.
[72:03.04]Because we do have a shitload more videos to watch.
[72:11.04]Up next.
[72:12.60]Jerma says hello in the fight.
[72:16.18]Don't know what the fight is.
[72:19.46]Ever seen it?
[72:20.24]Don't know.
[72:28.61]You have spoilers?
[72:30.56]Spoilers for the fight.

[73:45.22]Okay.
[73:45.62]All right, so he won.
[73:58.23]Is there more?
[73:58.97]There's more.
[74:01.52]I found myself in the high school dance.
[74:06.32]Nervous for all of us.
[74:08.36]Except on this particular day.
[74:15.88]You didn't do anything.
[74:21.40]That is, I believe what we just watched is... Shit, gotta make deadline.
[74:25.82]Gotta hit export.
[74:26.76]It was good though.
[74:34.95]Yeah, I'm really enjoying this school dance.
[74:40.01]Can I come a little closer?
[74:51.12]Wait, what am I doing?
[74:52.95]Am I choking someone?
[74:55.15]So do you have any math homework they have for this one?
[75:01.14]I have missed Steven since she's the worst.
[75:10.02]Entering the ring first, we have the bad boy, Joey Jamela.
[75:19.24]Wait, what is this?
[75:20.10]This is another, wait, this is a bunch of actors, this is all actors?
[75:29.80]And his opponent, entering the ring from Boston, Massachusetts, Jerma985.
[75:36.08]I'm coming for you.
[75:42.06]You're the one I'm going to get.
[75:43.30]I remember you, you invisible pussy.
[75:52.24]You guys have bad blood.
[75:55.67]This is versus the invisible man.
[75:57.33]Okay, yes, yes, I know this.
[75:58.97]I've seen this.
[76:03.01]I didn't want to knock this, but I did.
[76:07.87]That's a little tight.
[76:09.93]Ow, ow.
[76:12.13]Why?
[76:12.41]You can't do this to me.
[76:14.71]Ow, do you have any idea who I am?
[76:16.27]Yeah, Sherman985, look me up.
[76:17.49]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[76:22.51]Ow!
[76:47.68]And your winner...
[77:13.64]Oh my god.
[77:13.96]Hold on, I want to see the roll-up again.
[77:15.32]That roll-up was so good.
[77:16.30]He's up top!
[77:17.16]Looking for the switch!
[77:18.56]Oh, he nailed him!
[77:41.26]Babies do that.
[77:49.53]Okay.
[77:49.97]That was awesome.
[77:51.65]Jerma sits down for dinner with his family.
[77:55.77]Okay.
[78:02.84]We saw this already.
[78:11.55]Okay.
[78:12.53]No, did we see this exact one?
[78:13.73]I don't think we saw this one.
[78:32.55]Okay.
[78:36.01]So, what do we have tonight?
[78:37.77]Look at that.
[78:42.93]Potatoes, mashed potatoes and gravy.
[78:47.73]You've all done yourself.
[78:49.94]Can you pass the salt, please?
[78:57.00]Thank you, and I'll throw it over here.
[78:59.46]What, am I just a sicko?
[79:05.01]Okay, so how was your day, son?
[79:13.09]Wow.
[79:16.47]In class.
[79:18.13]That's unbelievable.
[79:21.41]Susie?
[79:25.27]My kids, my kids are the smartest, straight A's.
[79:31.37]This is like, this is sad.
[79:32.77]That's a little tough, I think.
[79:35.21]A little tough, a little overdone, but it's still good.
[79:41.31]This is scary and sad and horrible.
[79:44.17]Well, my day was pretty interesting.
[79:46.95]I got fired.
[79:47.97]I can't even, like, watch it.
[79:50.49]It's so fucked up.
[79:55.57]Yep.
[79:58.51]And then I got hired.
[79:59.17]Oh, my God.
[80:04.59]By the company next door.
[80:06.98]Just walked up, brought my briefcase in.
[80:09.42]This is the TLT guy.
[80:10.64]Perfect.
[80:11.00]Oh, my God.
[80:11.52]I'm so happy.
[80:12.02]Ow.
[80:19.77]Ow.
[80:20.65]Ow.
[80:27.92]Ah.
[80:28.32]Hold on.
[80:28.74]I need to take a second.
[80:29.60]That hurt.
[80:31.58]Oh, that scared me.
[80:35.42]Oh.
[80:39.04]We're not even halfway.
[80:43.86]Alright.
[80:44.12]Alright, let's start.
[80:46.68]Let's go again.
[80:48.63]The timing was perfect on that too, by the way.
[80:50.91]Like, very stellar editing here.
[80:56.03]Well, my day was pretty interesting.
[80:59.23]I got fired.
[81:07.46]Yep.
[81:10.38]And then I got hired.
[81:16.88]By the company next door.
[81:18.84]Just walked out, brought my briefcase in.
[81:21.28]Distinguished DLT guy!
[81:22.52]Perfect!
[81:22.98]Oh my god, I'm so happy.
[81:44.03]What is this?
[81:46.07]What is this?
[81:48.63]What?
[81:49.85]Oh, boy.
[81:52.34]Oh, no.
[81:55.06]So loud.
[81:56.28]Shut up.
[81:57.14]Shut up.
[81:57.66]Get out.
[81:58.30]Go back.
[81:58.76]Back into the scene.
[81:59.44]Come on.
[82:06.61]So I heard.
[82:07.15]Who'd you got to fight today, son?
[82:16.58]Okay.
[82:20.30]Let me tell you something.
[82:22.58]If you can do not do it diplomatically, then you shouldn't be doing it at all.
[82:26.86]We only eat McDonald's.
[82:30.14]I want to go to McDonald's.
[82:32.53]Gravy, potatoes, meat, cheese, onions, tomatoes, peppers.
[82:37.43]Well, I mean, it's kind of insane.
[82:39.01]I heard that you punched him.
[82:43.43]Did you, you punched him?
[82:44.51]You punched him in the face?
[82:46.47]My son doesn't do that.
[82:48.39]Diplomacy only.
[82:50.87]You know how much trouble I can get in?
[82:55.70]I'm in the, I'm in the gosh darn, whew, I'm getting heated here.
[83:02.00]My son, a United States representative.
[83:07.54]That's your, I'm your dad.
[83:09.12]Yeah, I'm the representative, not you.
[83:10.74]That would be strange now, wouldn't it?
[83:13.66]You gotta do things diplomatically or you're grounded.
[83:16.42]No, you know what?
[83:18.07]I can, I'll handle it.
[83:19.69]You are grounded.
[83:21.41]You're grounded.
[83:22.75]We don't fight in this family.
[83:26.61]Eat your gosh darn, I keep saying that stuff and I don't want to.
[83:37.62]Now listen, family, if we could join hands.
[83:43.50]No?
[83:43.94]Okay.
[83:58.53]Is that it?
[84:00.43]Wait, what?
[84:08.49]Somebody said, this is a scene you'd see at the Oscars for a nominee.
[84:14.26]Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?
[84:17.69]HAPPY BIRTH- Oh, God.
[84:23.81]All chairs turn as Ger- I already know- I've seen the whole video, I don't even need to see it, but I'm still laughing about it.

[96:03.91]I can't tell.
[96:04.39]Or this could be a part of the movie.
[96:07.39]This could be a very somewhere late game or I don't know, mid game.

[98:29.42]You edited out my pants.
[98:37.75]This is like a 3D model.
[98:39.53]This is like a Sims character in the mirror.
[98:45.13]Those aren't real feet.
[98:55.05]How did he do it?
[98:55.95]I don't know.
[98:56.39]He... I don't know.
[98:58.39]Did he put it in front of a green screen?
[99:02.14]He had to have made a 3D character or a model or something.
[99:08.66]He put it in front of a green screen and then cut it, but... No, this is not me.
[99:15.46]It's the creator.
[99:16.26]It's the editor's legs.
[99:19.12]So you're telling me the editor did a full frontal nude video and then edited me on top of it?
[99:30.10]No, that's a 3D model.
[99:31.44]You can clearly tell.
[99:32.34]Okay, let's go.

[99:55.01]Three, two, one, go.
[99:58.05]Where's the audio?
[100:41.14]Wait, this is terrible.
[100:44.68]Absolutely terrible.
[100:46.18]There we go.
[100:46.98]Bonus.
[100:47.20]Nothing about this is good.
[100:49.62]Skeleton, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:54.55]Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy for Jerma Rumble 2020.
[101:10.73]You know what's fucking ridiculous about that picture?
[101:13.95]Let's break this down real quick.
[101:16.95]This was just thrown together over footage that was taken almost 10 years ago.
[101:22.79]The ads that you see now look like this.
[101:28.42]This stupid fucking thing pops up on the top of your browser, on the right of your browser, on the left of your browser.
[101:34.22]We have come so far in technology.
[101:37.02]Why haven't the ads caught up?
[101:39.47]Right?
[101:39.71]Isn't that... I feel like that's a huge problem why people don't want to fucking listen to a single ad.
[101:43.61]Or look at a single ad.
[101:44.73]Because they look like this.
[101:45.97]They look like they were made in paint in 10 seconds.
[101:58.06]That's stupid.
[101:58.76]You're right.
[101:59.26]What do you mean?
[101:59.62]Am I being... Wait, am I being disagreed with?
[102:05.38]Am I being disagreed with?
[102:09.11]Oh.
[102:09.93]You don't have Adblock.
[102:11.19]LOL.
[102:13.53]Yeah, but the reason why Adblock was invented in the first place is because a banner would pop up and it would be like somebody's dick.
[102:23.08]Or it would be like some weird fucked up website that you don't want to go to anymore.
[102:28.11]And you'd be like, when I say anymore, I mean like ever.
[102:33.57]Okay, let's back that up.
[102:37.29]Listen, ads were intrusive.
[102:39.51]I fucking can't.
[102:47.60]Ads were intrusive, they were annoying, and they were ugly.
[102:51.16]They were very ugly.
[102:54.10]And now, they may have even, some companies try to make ads look a little better, but they take up your whole screen.
[103:01.77]Especially on mobile, and you try to close the thing and you keep scrolling, it pops back up again, scroll... No.
[103:06.99]Just... They've taken over the whole screen, not just annoyed some of it, and put, like, gross, weird stuff.
[103:12.80]Alright, let's go.
[103:14.98]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[103:17.54]Just use Adblock.
[103:18.18]But that was why Adblock was invented.
[103:19.91]It was because ads sucked in the first place.
[103:21.49]What if ads didn't suck?
[103:22.49]Why do you think I don't run ads on this channel?
[103:25.71]Because they're fucking annoying.
[103:28.80]And I don't want to have you guys suffer through the same, like, three ads.
[103:34.11]200 times.
[103:38.29]How many times do you guys want to watch the new, like, Call of Duty trailer?
[103:40.75]40 to 50 times?
[103:49.00]I don't, I don't, I wouldn't want to do that.
[103:52.42]Living above a SPI nest.
[103:53.82]Okay, let's go.
[104:01.35]Hi.
[104:01.73]Hello.
[104:02.09]Yes.
[104:02.35]How are you?
[104:03.89]Shut up.
[104:05.81]Shut up.
[104:06.62]All of you.
[104:08.62]It's ridiculous.
[104:10.48]It's like this every single day and I'm sick and tired of hearing it.
[104:17.40]I can hear you all the way up here and I pay rent too.
[104:23.91]Unbelievable.
[104:32.72]Yes.
[104:34.38]Here comes another Star Wars clip.
[104:37.90]This is chat during green screen streams.
[104:39.91]If you've never seen any of the Star Wars, who cares?
[104:42.41]I'll be honest.
[104:46.95]Don't worry, but it's alright.
[104:50.77]Alright, here we go.
[104:51.37]Chat during a green screen stream.
[104:52.59]This is going to be from one of the sequel series of Star Wars.
[104:56.99]Be careful if you haven't seen it.

[105:39.07]The bar is in the way.
[105:39.79]Ow.

[105:50.78]Short and sweet.
[105:53.30]Germacraft gets interrupted by the Iron Giant.
[105:57.18]Is this the Iron Giant?
[106:03.27]Okay.

[107:59.11]I don't know what the hell happened.
[108:17.75]This made me love the Iron Giant character so much.
[108:20.39]Hey.
[108:22.21]Alright.

[109:54.28]After a while, Jeremy and Earl made it to Final Jeopardy.
[109:56.74]It cost us this much money to hire Louie Anderson.
[110:01.78]Bob, what is $3,200?
[110:02.49]Probably more than that.
[110:15.23]Wait, me?

[111:14.42]Like, I... I bought this.
[111:18.14]Like, I purchased this thing.
[111:22.48]I think they claimed this song.
[111:26.26]No, this is not Dr. Phil.
[111:31.60]Is that Dr. Phil?
[111:37.92]No, it's not.
[111:39.91]Is this a repeat thing?
[111:41.17]Did we talk about this already?
[111:47.81]Yes, we did.
[111:48.93]Yeah, I was playing Visitor Cleanup News.
[111:50.20]Yeah, you're right, you're right.
[111:51.06]Yeah.
[111:57.82]Guys, remember, I've spoken out loud for like 20 years straight.
[112:01.66]Sometimes it's hard to remember.

[112:42.26]I am here on vacation.
[112:59.85]Oh no, you didn't have the video outside the plane window.
[113:04.07]So many waves.
[113:35.67]Nobody used this for what I wanted either.
[113:38.89]Nobody put me on a slide.
[113:55.56]What the fuck is going on?
[113:57.28]I'm gonna sneeze.
[113:58.46]I just want you to know, I just want you to understand I'm gonna sneeze and I don't want you to be near me.
[114:06.68]I held it in.
[114:10.37]No, don't sneeze, don't sneeze, don't sneeze.
[114:14.71]Sorry for making this mess of a video.
[114:16.15]It's 3 a.m.
[114:16.79]I'm so bored.
[114:17.41]Thanks for watching, though.
[114:18.17]I'll be surprised if this even makes it in.
[114:29.95]Well, it did.
[114:30.61]I liked it.
[114:32.73]What was wrong with it?
[114:33.43]Damn.
[114:34.12]Every American household had that computer 15 years ago.

[115:40.80]I think I should be the first person to say yes.
[115:45.80]This is like you made the... Okay, well look, this is your moment and good luck.
[115:50.50]You made like a... This is a Simon... Whatever his name is video.

[116:07.01]Come on.
[116:07.75]Come on.
[116:41.41]This isn't working for me.
[116:42.94]I'm just looking and seeing some of the others while I'm seeing originality.
[116:47.18]This to me is too generic.
[116:49.50]Not enough personality.
[116:53.12]Huh?
[116:55.98]Okay.
[116:57.42]We have a guy back here.
[116:59.26]What's that, sir?
[117:01.06]I'm kind of in the middle of doing something here.
[117:04.08]Can we get security to take care of this guy?
[117:10.86]You could be funnier than I am.
[117:12.84]I highly doubt that, though.
[117:19.39]Get out of here!
[118:03.78]That was great.
[118:12.46]The Kylo-Jerma drive-thru.
[118:16.19]My fucking eyes hurt.
[118:19.35]My eyes hurt from just like laughing at this shit.
[118:22.35]Okay, here we go.
[118:38.04]I know what you want.
[118:42.82]You're gonna get number three.
[118:48.84]A large number three.
[118:51.38]You're a small fry, aren't you?
[118:52.88]I can feel it.
[118:53.64]I can feel it.
[118:54.92]Can I get a... Do you guys still have coffee?
[118:58.30]Do you guys have coffee?
[118:59.28]It says you serve breakfast all day.
[119:01.98]I'm one of those fucking weirdos that comes at like 7.30 looking for all the breakfast items.
[119:07.06]Excuse me.
[119:09.28]Wow, this place is sick.
[119:11.29]Can you put ice in it?
[119:13.57]Can you put some ice in the coffee, please?
[119:36.98]Jesus Christ.
[119:37.40]Really good use of the Bugleberry cameo.
[120:06.47]He loves it.
[120:07.22]He loves McDonald's.
[120:11.62]Okay, there's Dermot in a bottle of water.
[120:49.35]Who will breathe?
[120:55.49]Idiots.

[121:16.94]This right here.
[121:18.60]is absolute perfection.
[121:24.78]This is it right here!
[121:37.00]No, it's not Purple Alien.
[121:38.22]Don't get your hopes up.
[121:44.90]Hey.

[121:50.34]Here's what I have to say about this.
[121:53.00]See this bullshit?

[122:30.28]Jerma hits a home run.
[122:31.06]Breeze hits it in the air to center.

[124:43.01]Now imagine doing that like 4,000 times.
[124:49.61]That was stimulation.
[124:50.63]That's right.
[124:53.39]That was awesome.
[124:55.53]Alright, this is another song I think we're going to get here.

[126:16.50]I was spooked.
[126:18.14]I almost did.
[126:48.73]Turkey arms.
[126:50.55]Jermis Bunt of 46.
[126:51.81]The year was 1946, and veteran player Jeremy Albertson had joined the Boston Red Sox.
[127:00.20]Jeremy had found himself playing with some of the greatest to ever put on the Red Sox uniform, like Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky, and Teddy Ballgame himself, Ted Williams.
[127:11.13]Jeremy was a strong player, being a consistently good hitter throughout his entire career.
[127:15.37]However, Jeremy was quite mediocre when it came to his defense.
[127:19.25]His short stature meant that some balls would go right past him.
[127:23.09]And when Jeremy was moved to the outfield, things didn't get any better.
[127:41.28]But on one fateful day, during one fateful game, Jeremy would write himself into their history books forever with one visit to the batter's box.
[127:50.18]Jeremy hits it high and deep to right field.
[127:52.56]And that ball is... Somebody did it.
[127:55.45]Somebody did the bunt home run.
[127:56.91]Can you believe it?
[127:58.53]He just bunted that ball into the stands.
[128:02.89]Big wow.
[128:05.43]Truly one of the greatest home runs you'll ever see.
[128:08.75]This guy is fucked.
[128:14.63]And sure enough, the home run became history.
[128:17.89]Jeremy remains as the only player to have bunted a ball for an out-of-the-park home run.
[128:22.51]Many have tried, but Albertson's home run stands alone to this day.
[128:30.53]Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent.
[128:36.18]All right, coming up next.
[128:37.06]You know what's cool about baseball now, Rich, is if we get... There was final game before rehab highlights.
[128:44.10]Another baseball.
[128:44.82]We're getting baseball ones back to back here.
[128:50.52]You know what's cool about baseball now, Rich, is we get to see more of players' personalities and to see players, the other side, that a lot of times as fans you don't get to see their personalities, their laugh, their smile, their characteristics.
[129:05.60]And I think it's a great thing that baseball is doing now.
[129:08.16]What is he doing?
[129:15.03]He's that threat.
[129:15.81]He wants to be up in those big moments.
[129:19.90]That one's hit.
[129:20.98]Empty.
[129:21.84]Came back.
[129:23.50]And that's gone.
[129:27.26]Goodness.
[129:27.72]41,000 here.
[129:28.02]That's the first out of the bottom of the eighth.
[129:32.32]What a thrill today.
[129:34.00]Game-winning home run in front of 40,000 fans.
[129:36.94]Congratulations, young man.
[129:39.54]Stay healthy and good luck the rest of the way.
[129:41.46]Big hit to the outside of the bounce.
[129:46.66]That's pretty cool.
[129:47.87]I mean, that is really cool.
[129:50.05]I have to watch the whole one again.
[129:51.77]I'm sorry.
[129:52.35]I have to watch the entire thing again.
[129:54.39]You know what's cool about baseball now, Rich, is we get to see more of players' personalities and to see players, the other side, that a lot of times as fans you don't get to see their personalities, their laugh, their smile, their characteristics, and I think it's a great thing that baseball is doing now.
[130:12.16]He's at the plate.
[130:15.68]What is he doing?
[130:18.88]He's that threat.
[130:19.70]He wants to be up in those big moments.
[130:23.76]That one's hit.
[130:24.86]Empty.
[130:25.76]Came back.
[130:27.38]And that's gone.
[130:30.59]Goodness.
[130:31.59]41,000 here.
[130:33.73]That's the first out of the bottom of the eighth.
[130:36.21]What a thrill today.
[130:37.89]Game-winning home run in front of 40,000 fans.
[130:40.81]Congratulations, young man.
[130:43.39]Stay healthy and good luck the rest of the way.
[130:45.31]Big hit to the outside of the bounce.
[130:50.53]That's pretty cool.
[130:51.75]I mean, that is really cool.
[130:53.48]That's pretty cool, man.
[130:55.84]Holy shit.
[130:59.40]That was great.
[131:00.32]That was back-to-back.
[131:01.14]Two great back-to-back baseball-themed ones.
[131:05.17]Down the rat hole.
[131:06.19]Here we go.
[131:09.29]Oh, shit.
[131:09.69]Someone's coming in.
[131:10.37]Oh, fuck, dude.
[131:12.17]Oh, he's got a knife!
[131:19.24]Got him!
[131:21.62]This is Jeremy.
[131:24.46]A once thriving 34 year old with a loving following, a gamer girlfriend and a stable job.
[131:31.19]He was on top of the mountain of success.
[131:34.01]His life seemed to be perfect.
[131:36.29]Then what went wrong?
[131:38.24]From prime-time streamer down to a hole of addiction and fights, we go down the rat hole of Yerma985.
[131:45.23]Am I dead in this video?
[131:53.47]It all began with his notorious streams of various games, which amazed millions of views and thousands of followers.
[132:01.27]Thanks to his charming personality and humor, this quickly skyrocketed Yemami into success.
[132:09.10]At first he was easygoing with his newfound fundings, spending his newfound money on better quality for his streams and better games to entertain his fanbase.
[132:18.74]But this power quickly began to decadence.
[132:23.48]His popularity quickly made him develop on it for more power.
[132:27.17]As you can sometimes see in his streams, the rage he had boiling inside of him, streams quickly dropped in quality as he became more desperate for popularity.
[132:36.99]Eventually, this would lead to a gambling addiction, as to find any way of feeling strong once more.
[132:44.05]But it would prove to become a failed attempt.
[132:46.41]I don't even care if I win.
[132:50.67]This is the rush of the colors.
[132:53.45]Now with no money and no fame, he resorted to giving moral speeches.
[132:58.76]That's so fucking dumb.
[133:04.12]That's so stupid.
[133:06.46]That's dumb.
[133:09.82]Huh?
[133:09.98]What are you talking about?
[133:11.62]That's fucking stupid.
[133:12.68]Okay.
[133:13.85]Okay, we have a guy back here.
[133:15.57]What's that, sir?
[133:17.33]I'm kind of in the middle of doing something.
[133:19.27]Yeah, look what I'm holding up, buddy.
[133:22.46]Yeah, middle finger.
[133:23.52]Middle finger.
[133:24.44]Can we get security to take care of this guy?
[133:26.62]No, we can't.
[133:27.28]They're not going to do anything to me.
[133:28.65]Because I'm not doing anything wrong.
[133:31.11]You could be funnier than I am.
[133:32.79]I am funnier than you.
[133:33.99]I know I'm funnier than you.
[133:35.35]What are you doing?
[133:37.37]What the fuck?
[133:40.72]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[133:43.84]As we tried to capture footage, he recognized us and became hostile very quickly.
[133:49.09]Why do I have to hurt and kill so many of you guys?
[133:51.43]You're the one I'm gonna get!
[133:55.63]Die, you motherfucker!
[134:00.05]Police were called, but in his rageful state of mind, he resisted arrest.
[134:22.84]And that's the end of Jeremy's story.
[134:25.26]From what it seemed to be the peak of success, it all came crumbling down the rat hole.
[134:31.19]Thank you very much.
[134:48.51]That was nuts.
[134:50.75]Ugh.
[134:53.49]So you guys, okay, you guys don't hear, because I have like a noise gate on, and like I lean back when I watch, and sometimes I mute if I get a little too weird.
[135:02.04]But I've just been in a constant state of like contracting body.
[135:10.85]Like I've just been sitting here just giggling like a little shit.
[135:13.99]Just constantly.
[135:15.19]Constantly.
[135:19.92]okay here we go this is the story of when I met germa I hope this is just somebody just dictates the electric uh interference thing oh yeah like this like you're doing now I hope somebody's narrates it I was walking my kids from school one day and I ran into jeremy
[135:42.26]I told him how big of a fan I was, how he makes me laugh, and that I appreciate him.
[135:46.76]All I could see in his eyes were dollar signs.
[135:49.29]He asked me, How large was the last donation you made?
[135:53.03]He explained that I am a single father.
[135:55.69]I don't make enough to donate to him, that I will try in the future.
[135:59.75]He said to me, that my child, word for word, Suck a thot out of my ass.
[136:06.52]walked away.
[136:07.76]Stay in my life.
[136:11.24]Didn't happen.
[136:13.24]That didn't happen.
[136:17.00]But, you know.
[136:18.30]Of course it did.
[136:18.94]Because somebody copied and pasted it on a forum somewhere.
[136:23.78]This is German.
[136:24.29]The Fortune City Zombie Outbreak.
[136:27.81]Dead Rising 2.
[136:28.63]I'm going to play Dead Rising 2.
[136:33.23]Well, Dead Rising 1 is better.
[136:35.25]So it's okay.
[136:36.77]And then Dead Rising 3 is not very good at all.
[136:39.05]So, don't worry.
[136:44.87]Still a good game, Dead Rising 2.
[136:46.89]I did enjoy it very much so.
[136:49.70]Even though I got gaslit into playing the wrong version.
[136:55.58]But, you know, I still liked it.
[136:56.56]It was very, very good.
[136:57.40]Alright, here we go.
[137:06.69]Oh, no!
[137:07.57]Oh, no, no, no, no!
[137:10.33]No!
[137:10.45]No!
[137:22.86]I'm one of the survivors.
[137:24.14]Yes.
[137:53.12]Wait, wait, wait, me?
[137:55.08]Wait, me?
[137:57.82]They think I'm a zombie?
[138:31.86]Come on, get it.
[138:35.45]You can get it.
[139:04.98]Rare emote, holy shit.
[139:10.82]Biggest daily use of that emote since I made it.
[139:13.58]Did I get any money?
[140:02.45]This video gets plus one letter grade.
[140:08.95]Oh, shit.
[140:11.46]I'm good.
[140:12.96]No, I'm not.
[140:14.76]Yeah, well, I moved here when I was probably 19 or so.
[140:20.58]Yeah.
[140:22.84]Oh, shit, sorry, yeah, sorry.
[140:28.29]It's a great place.
[140:29.05]You'll probably like it.
[140:37.39]I don't want to step on that.
[140:47.70]This is my favorite part.
[140:50.16]This is the best part.
[140:50.98]It was fun.
[140:51.82]Do you understand how long I'm going to be here for?
[140:53.89]This is terrible.
[141:04.07]Absolutely terrible.
[141:07.07]Nothing about this is good.
[141:08.91]Not one thing.
[141:09.75]I wasn't there for this long.
[141:13.86]I was there for like maybe five minutes tops.
[141:18.29]Oh, I'm late!
[141:39.39]That happened all too often.
[141:41.28]I can't manage time for shit.
[141:44.24]There was Elden Bones.
[142:04.50]Did I ever tell you this story?
[142:09.32]About the old board.
[142:11.78]Take this from me right now.
[142:17.24]Take it from me.
[142:18.75]Take it from me, dude.
[142:20.37]You could even imagine it.
[142:25.33]That which shocked twelve people in one second.
[142:29.07]Like you just saw.
[142:31.33]Right there.
[142:36.17]The Elden Wall.
[142:39.82]Ah, you fucking dick!
[142:43.65]Why?
[143:00.00]Oh, what happened?
[143:00.92]Don't do that.
[143:03.98]Add that to the list of rules.
[143:05.12]Put that on the list of rules.
[143:06.34]I want that on the list.
[143:07.12]No loud explosive noises.
[143:08.82]It already is.
[143:09.38]It already is on the fucking rules.
[143:13.99]All right.
[143:16.49]Louder, louder, louder.
[143:17.41]All right, here we go.
[143:18.67]Coming up next is a... Wait.
[143:23.43]Okay, Matthew's birthday bash.
[143:25.85]Giant rats crew featuring German 985.

[144:15.46]And Matthew, it's your birthday today, cake and ice cream is on its way.
[144:21.32]And Matthew, it's your birthday today, cake and ice cream is on its way.
[144:32.96]I'll talk about something in a minute.
[145:04.99]Matthew, it's your birthday.
[145:07.67]Look at all these balloons.
[145:08.61]Look at all these balloons.
[145:09.80]There's balloons everywhere.
[145:10.94]I can't even get away from them.
[145:12.88]They're just surrounding me.
[145:14.22]Matthew, happy second birthday.
[145:16.84]My goodness, you're getting so old.
[145:19.62]You've grown up big and strong.
[145:20.86]Eat your vegetables, especially that broccoli.
[145:23.91]What's your favorite color?
[145:25.31]Mine's green.
[145:33.43]okay so you know uh what this is this is a videos that resurfaced 10 years later that I should be embarrassed of now today like oh hey look at this clip of you dude like remember back when you when you did this oh that was like two months ago oh
[146:03.90]It's like, oh, remember back in 2011 when you made the Minecraft series?
[146:08.12]Germacraft?
[146:10.59]That's the kind of reaction I should be having to these, right?
[146:12.51]But I did them, like, not even a year ago.
[146:19.75]That's fucking hilarious.
[146:20.74]All right.
[146:24.27]I'm going to take the next, like, two or three weeks and 100, hey, only focus on me and my daughter.
[146:31.01]That means a lot.
[146:31.81]And get actually, definitively, truly diagnosed for whatever the fuck is going on.
[146:34.66]What is this?
[146:57.28]Oh, all right, all right, all right.
[147:06.15]Also, I want to hear, I got to talk about this.
[147:09.35]So this kind of bleeds into a conversation we could have about future videos.
[147:15.95]If we could stay away from like real tragedy, that would be a very good thing.
[147:26.79]There's been a couple of videos that have come through that are like, oh, hey, we've got like, oh, there's like a house that burnt down and stuff.
[147:34.54]You know what I mean?
[147:39.52]Like, oh, no, but this is the Paul Walker clip, right?
[147:51.23]Don't they do like a thing?
[147:57.41]It's the movie.
[147:57.95]No, I know it's the movie, but what I'm saying is like... This is from Fast and Furious.
[148:03.03]Yeah.
[148:11.00]That is dumb.
[148:13.94]I'm not saying like... What I'm talking about is Paul Walker died.
[148:16.66]Kind of right before this, right?
[148:20.98]Although this is like a goodbye to Paul Walker, right?
[148:27.71]It's... I mean, putting me here, I don't know.
[148:32.68]Like, it's sort of like... Yeah, you're right.
[148:38.34]I'm just trying to come off as... I'm trying not to be... I don't want these to be, like, disrespectful.
[148:42.56]We'll put it that way.
[148:44.53]And as however I can say that, I'm going to say that.
[148:47.09]Okay?
[148:49.57]Okay.
[148:54.57]Am I overthinking it?
[148:55.89]Maybe a little bit, but I still, I don't, I know that like some, some stuff can come across as like disrespectful and I don't want that to happen.
[149:06.03]But let's go.
[149:06.75]That's the window going down.
[149:13.91]I used to say I lived my life a quarter mile at a time.
[149:18.75]And I think that's why we were brothers.
[149:21.78]It's his channel.
[149:22.94]Well, look, there's been a lot of videos that have come through.
[149:30.92]And we try to, like, put them in a good enough order, and we try to weed out... There'll be, like, 500 videos.
[149:38.38]So... My channel, my rules.
[149:45.88]There's also on that list, we gotta talk about like the copyright stuff.
[149:48.14]We gotta be careful there too.
[149:50.30]That's another thing we have to, we'll talk about this at the end.
[149:52.78]We'll go over this at the end.
[149:59.38]You did too.
[150:09.91]It's my channel.
[150:13.72]It's not your channel.
[150:15.40]It's my channel.
[150:18.05]He's above the law.
[150:19.39]Alright, let's go.
[150:30.18]And the dead angle doesn't bait it.
[150:32.78]Gets caught low again.
[150:33.98]Has to burst immediately.
[150:35.06]Full meter though.
[150:35.86]Full meter.
[150:37.27]He's going to have to deuce.
[150:39.17]Oh, he can't.
[150:39.97]Nope.
[150:40.29]No burst.
[150:40.91]No burst.
[150:41.41]So smart.
[150:42.47]Oh, my God.
[150:42.97]Jesus.
[150:43.65]So smart.
[150:44.15]He couldn't burst because of the super.
[150:46.11]What was he going to do?
[150:47.79]It's over.
[150:48.49]Oh, my God.
[150:55.33]I don't even know what that is, but I feel like I just experienced all of it.
[151:25.66]I experienced that entire turn of it.
[151:37.79]You did though.

[191:12.55]Because I have two different sides.
[191:14.83]I have the very professional side.
[191:16.31]Well, we're going to need a lot of that, so it's really, really important that you understand.
[191:20.51]Here's a cup.
[191:21.49]What's that?
[191:22.65]This cup is good.
[191:23.61]What do you have?
[191:24.11]I'm going to take a chance.
[191:25.05]Well, my day was pretty interesting.
[191:26.96]Yeah, with you.
[191:27.68]Wait, me?
[191:28.44]Wait, me?
[191:29.76]You're fired.
[191:31.58]I got fired.
[191:33.14]No, I'm just kidding.
[191:33.88]You're hired.
[191:34.28]I'm not fucking firing you.
[191:35.66]And then I got hired.
[191:36.80]No way.
[191:37.84]No way.
[191:38.18]Right here, man.
[191:40.20]Fuck you.
[191:40.76]That's right, son.
[191:41.43]You can say something.
[191:42.25]Before you say anything, I just want to make sure that you're aware of how strong I am as your company manager.
[191:47.49]This wooden desk, you see, is 445 pounds.
[191:51.29]And with ease, I can just get it.
[191:52.56]I don't think it's worth it.
[192:04.24]I feel like I didn't process this one, but I want to.
[192:11.51]So this is the virtual world.
[192:16.39]I'm spooked.
[192:18.87]Oh, excuse me.
[192:19.71]Oh!
[192:23.92]A wild shpee nest on Dustbowl.
[192:26.97]They pop up from time to time, but we've got to be really careful here, guys.
[192:30.73]This is the middle of mating season.
[192:32.65]Blue shpees and red shpees are going to be mating.
[192:34.43]We've got to be very, very quiet here.
[192:36.89]What is this?
[192:38.64]What the fuck is this?
[192:40.12]Is this a dream?
[192:40.86]Is this a dream?
[192:41.42]What happened?
[192:42.44]Is this a dream?
[192:43.94]Oh, shit.
[192:44.70]Oh, shit.
[192:45.56]Does he see me?
[192:48.14]No!
[192:48.88]That would have been very bad.
[192:49.86]Dream!
[192:51.85]I don't like how they're reacting to this, though.
[192:53.65]I don't like how... Oh, God.
[192:54.93]Oh, God.
[192:55.25]I just thought I could get out of here.
[192:57.59]Don't you just have fall guys waiting for him?
[193:03.50]My career did not peak at Shpi.
[193:06.28]Someone who will be proven wrong by a 100% germaproblem.
[193:09.16]Yeah.
[193:09.62]That didn't peak at Shpi.
[193:10.78]Come on.
[193:12.30]The rain wraps in chat.
[193:13.32]Why would you say that?
[193:17.23]Ugh.
[193:19.52]My brain is fried.
[193:20.36]It doesn't help that, like, I, you know, I decided today was the day that I was feeling a little tight this morning.
[193:27.48]And I did, I did, I did a little bit, I did a little bit of THC and CBD to make, to alleviate that.
[193:32.95]And this is probably the wrong day.
[193:38.35]Like two hours ago, I was just like, wait a minute.
[193:42.23]What the hell, what the fuck is happening?
[193:45.51]It was about two and a half hours ago.
[193:46.97]I realize it's probably... But you know what?
[193:48.71]It's alright.
[193:53.67]By the way, it's 100% legal in Las Vegas.
[193:55.57]Recreationally.
[193:56.17]So don't worry.
[193:56.57]I don't take it recreationally.
[193:57.55]I take it for medical uses.
[194:04.91]Sure.
[194:05.61]Alright.
[194:06.15]A man has fallen into Lego City.
[194:08.67]A man has fallen into the river in Lego City.
[194:10.94]Start the new rescue helicopter.
[194:14.36]Hey!
[194:15.02]Build the helicopter.
[194:15.92]And off to the rescue.
[194:20.17]Prepare the lifeline.
[194:22.05]Lower the stretcher.
[194:23.71]And make the rescue.
[194:24.99]The new emergency collection from LEGO City.
[194:27.93]I love this one.
[194:29.55]I love this one.
[194:40.83]So what do we have tonight?
[194:42.37]Look at that.
[195:06.45]I think these have turned out to be my favorite ones.
[195:09.35]Like, somehow.
[195:10.19]Just because it's the same... It's the same footage, and you just happen to change it a little bit.
[195:20.90]So, what do we have tonight?
[195:22.65]Look at that.
[195:24.79]Delicious.
[195:27.71]Potatoes.
[195:28.71]I thought this was going to be used... Gravy.
[195:30.85]Hold on.
[195:31.71]I thought this was going to be used the least out of every clip that was done.
[195:35.31]In my mind, no one was going to ever use this.
[195:37.31]Even the ones where I said no one's going to use this.
[195:40.28]People might, but this was... What were you supposed to do with this besides just have you do me sitting at a dinner table for five minutes?
[195:47.22]That's it.
[195:48.38]There's nothing else to do with this.
[195:49.46]Look at that.
[195:52.08]Delicious.
[195:55.04]Potatoes.
[195:56.30]Mashed potatoes, gravy, and mashed gravy.
[195:59.04]You've all done yourself.
[196:02.30]Can you pass the salt, please?
[196:06.70]I'll throw it over here.
[196:14.64]Okay.
[196:16.30]So how was your day, son?
[196:20.16]Wow.
[196:21.74]That's unbelievable.
[196:28.89]My kids, my kids are the smartest.
[196:31.15]Straight A's.
[196:31.81]That's a little tough, I think.
[196:38.74]A little tough.
[196:39.74]A little overdone, but it's still good.
[196:47.81]Well, my day was pretty interesting.
[196:51.01]I got fired.
[197:13.77]God damn it.
[197:17.13]My fucking head hurts.
[197:21.99]German Vangelion.
[197:22.93]This is Vangelion spoilers.
[197:24.75]Neon Genesis Vangelion spoilers.
[197:27.49]It's been 15 years.
[197:28.51]No doubt about it.
[197:29.61]It's a human.
[197:48.80]Wow.
[197:49.00]Wow.
[197:49.12]This is what it looks like up close.
[197:50.90]Are you in charge of this?
[197:53.26]That's right, son.
[197:53.70]Son, you are in big trouble.
[197:54.52]Ikari Shinji-kun?
[198:13.85]Well, I mean it's kind of it's kind of insane here
[198:48.34]Oh, Megatron!
[198:49.28]We've got Decepticons coming at us from two angles!
[198:52.04]One!
[198:52.44]Two!
[198:53.46]I don't understand.
[198:59.67]We're incredibly intelligent monsters!
[199:02.25]And people don't even take us seriously!
[199:07.93]God!
[199:08.07]The nerve of these scientists!
[199:18.69]Amazing!
[199:19.17]I didn't know there was such a hard time!
[199:21.70]I've been waiting for this!
[199:25.76]Idiot!
[199:26.40]I can't see the enemy in the smoke!
[199:29.68]What?
[199:33.00]They're already dead?
[199:35.12]It's okay.
[199:38.15]It's a bomb!
[199:57.87]Let me try!
[199:58.35]You!
[199:58.59]It's time for you to pay!
[200:38.51]Ow, my butthole.
[200:42.09]You have to shut this off.
[200:43.65]Shut them all off.
[200:46.38]I'm coming down there.
[200:51.46]I'm coming down there and I'm going to fuck you up.
[200:56.44]Stay right there.
[201:01.89]Don't move, all of you.
[201:04.68]You're trying to fight on the ground?
[201:19.00]Here's what I have to say about this.
[201:21.32]See this bullshit?
[201:22.26]Oh my god.
[202:14.00]That's a Spider-Man dance, right?
[202:16.32]Way to go, Pally!
[202:18.02]Hooray for you!
[202:20.12]That was fantastic!
[202:22.68]Thanks for the video.
[202:49.94]Grandma faked his breakdance.
[202:51.30]Okay, this is a 10 out of 10.
[203:00.74]10 out of 10 video.
[203:06.02]Didn't think I could do that, did you?
[203:07.56]Absolute, absolute masterpiece.
[203:10.03]Masterpiece.
[203:12.99]Grandma flies Republic Starfighter.
[203:17.07]Ugh, I don't even know what movie this is.
[203:18.27]I have no idea.
[203:19.63]It's one of the Star Wars movies.
[203:21.15]I don't know.
[203:21.81]Just if you're going to watch, just, you know.
[203:23.97]It's spoilers for a Star Wars movie.
[203:25.39]One of them.
[203:31.92]I don't, I don't want to hit it.
[203:36.92]I don't want to hit this thing.
[203:40.94]I'm going to go slow.
[203:41.66]I'm going to go really slow.
[204:09.25]Unbelievable.
[204:16.78]Is it alive?
[204:17.46]I don't know.
[204:19.64]Short streamer.
[204:22.62]Incoming.
[205:01.69]Life is pain.
[205:03.21]I hate myself.
[205:17.47]That's a good song.
[205:18.11]What song is this?
[205:18.97]I like this song.
[205:34.89]Is this from, like, Rhythm Heaven?
[205:48.06]That sounds cool.
[205:48.64]That was good.
[205:49.50]And the, and the rats in the background?
[205:51.74]Beautiful.
[205:54.02]Uh, this is Germa Hart's Final HD Remix Secret Episode.
[205:57.27]Okay, I don't know, I don't, I didn't play Kingdom Hearts 3.
[206:01.87]I don't even remember Kingdom Hearts 2 and 1.
[206:06.07]I don't know the story.
[206:08.19]But it's okay.
[206:09.39]Because the story, I could get the same story if I just kind of hit my head against my desk as hard as I could.
[206:15.74]And then just started thinking.
[206:17.28]I'm sure I'd come up with the same thing.
[206:20.86]So I don't know.
[206:21.52]I have no idea what the story is.
[206:22.74]I have no idea.
[206:24.32]So this is a secret.
[206:25.58]If you don't need to play or listen for that, who cares?
[206:29.17]What?
[206:29.59]Really?
[206:31.09]No way.
[206:54.58]Is this even... What even is this?
[207:02.16]Where's Donald and Goofy?
[207:21.68]I have no idea what's going on.
[207:54.26]Is that Gollum?
[207:56.66]I saved the world right there.
[207:59.41]I just saved the world.
[208:01.33]Here are my hearts.
[208:02.51]Breathe.
[208:23.53]Wait, was that the E3 trailer from, like, 2006?
[208:26.13]And then the game came out, actually, in, like, 2018?
[208:34.41]Alright, this is Time Space Adventures.
[208:53.73]Are you ready?
[208:54.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[208:56.57]What the fuck?

[212:39.19]Fucking rumors What?
[212:59.75]Dramatic finish!
[213:34.87]Secret Cauldron is a bad ending.
[213:38.31]That's for you to decide.
[213:40.89]Um, okay.
[213:42.99]That was ridiculous.
[213:45.05]My brain is gonna need some time after that one.
[213:52.75]That was so good.
[213:53.35]That was insane.
[213:54.03]That really was so good.
[213:58.49]Watch the secret ending.
[214:01.03]Watch the bad ending.
[214:08.21]It's time to do a rant to fill time.

[214:42.07]This is the secret alternate bad ending.
[214:47.91]Or the thing we just watched.
[214:57.90]Sure was fun, wasn't it, Jerma?
[215:26.72]Okay, so... At first I thought that was the moon theme.
[215:31.80]But no, that was Carmerelle dancing.
[215:35.25]No spoilers, I don't want you to see what's left.
[215:44.29]Okay, a peewee... peewee streamer.

[216:03.25]Yep.
[216:03.51]And it lands on the toes.
[216:04.37]Mm-hmm.
[216:05.23]Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is one of the best movies ever made.
[216:08.45]Can you move?
[216:08.97]Go watch it if you've never seen it.
[216:09.79]Can you please move?

[216:19.64]Like extreme influence.
[216:20.36]What did you do?
[216:22.45]The best scene in the whole movie.
[217:05.86]That was great.
[217:14.82]Wait, what happened?
[217:17.52]Did I skip one?

[220:15.42]Great prices.
[220:17.32]You guys got great prices.
[220:19.28]Don't sell it, though.
[220:19.98]I don't know.
[220:22.10]My favorite.
[220:41.18]Are you really fucking watching this shit?
[220:43.90]There's hamburgers in this town that don't quite make it.
[220:47.54]I just wish just once, just once that my cheese was soft and cold and my lettuce was cool and crisp all at the same time.
[220:55.11]You know, I'm talking about the new McDLT.
[220:59.41]I'm talking one pound of beef on the hot, hot side.
[221:03.86]I feel like this is, oh my God.
[221:07.22]Yeah, I do too.

[252:51.60]What?
[252:53.06]God, I hate this.
[252:54.72]Why are you being so mean?
[252:55.90]I hate this.
[252:56.78]This is terrible.
[252:57.34]Why can't you just give me genuine criticism?
[253:00.36]This is baseball.
[253:03.80]What the fuck?
[253:04.52]No, it's peace.
[253:05.28]I have socks in this one too.
[253:06.66]What the fuck are you?
[253:08.12]Have you been drinking gasoline?
[253:10.10]What the hell?
[253:11.64]Jeremy, what are you doing?
[253:13.00]No, no, no!
[253:16.37]I'm Dorothy!
[253:18.70]If you stumble upon this, thanks so much for making my life easier to cope with your huge inspiration.
[253:27.72]I'm glad I found your channel when I was younger.
[253:29.42]Thanks for the hilarious memoirs, meme-wars, quotes, and genuinely seeming like a kind person.
[253:35.67]Hope one day we can meet so you can pepper spray me in the face.
[253:42.10]Well, uh, no, it's my pleasure.
[253:45.48]Thank you.
[253:51.61]I don't think I will do the, I don't think I'll pepper spray you in the face.
[253:55.11]Unless we're doing a YouTube video with, like, crazy fucking stunts.
[253:58.55]And then you gotta do me, but then you gotta spray me, and then, like, I'm gonna say something really bad.
[254:13.28]Absolutely mental old resident lashes out.
[254:17.77]Boy do.
[254:20.69]No, but seriously.
[254:22.17]Thanks for watching.
[254:35.47]Excuse me!
[254:38.03]Can we be quiet, please?
[254:40.35]Some of us are trying to sleep.
[254:42.82]Everyone's using the same window asset?
[254:46.23]That's hilarious, yeah.
[254:54.98]Is this supposed to be my stream?
[254:58.86]It is, isn't it?
[255:06.67]I don't even know where you're going at this point.
[255:09.85]We've been driving all night.
[255:12.01]What in the... You're running over a guy right now.
[255:14.15]Oh, no.

[255:55.44]Again?
[255:56.04]Really?
[255:56.66]You're going to do this again?
[255:59.72]Words cannot even comprehend how it... Tiny German.
[256:03.82]Oh, you've got a mouth on you, don't you?
[256:05.46]I'm coming out there.

[256:26.90]Don't move, Ollie!
[256:32.70]Yeah, that's right.
[256:33.34]Wouldn't that make me huge?
[256:47.23]30 feet tall?
[256:53.62]Your question touches on one of the basic biological illnesses.
[257:02.44]Real tragedy?
[257:03.60]Ugh.
[257:04.73]I also detect some unspoken questions.
[257:09.13]Do our benefactors really know what's best for them?
[257:14.07]Yeah, yeah.
[257:18.50]There was throws through Pompeii.

[259:08.17]What I'm all saying is if you have an option to make me the butt of a joke, that's better.
[259:16.77]That's all I meant.
[259:17.61]That's all I meant.
[259:18.77]I know it was thousands of years ago.
[259:26.87]Yeah.
[259:28.35]No, no, no, no, no.
[259:29.11]It's not.
[259:29.37]Yeah, it is.

[259:35.66]What happened recently?

[259:39.32]That's like saying that the dinosaurs... No, I don't want to show anything about the dinosaurs because that's... Okay.
[260:02.51]Oh, no, no, no!
[260:03.11]You're not supposed to see this!
[260:03.97]You're not supposed to see this!
[260:05.93]This... That's a spoiler!
[260:09.09]Shit.
[260:10.95]You saw the last three videos.
[260:18.19]God damn it.
[260:21.41]Alright.
[260:22.64]It's alright.
[260:25.06]Okay, um... I...
[260:28.87]Let's just, let's see, what, this is 79 AD?
[260:31.59]So this is like, what, this is like 2,000 years ago?
[260:34.46]Do you have any idea?
[260:36.62]The, the absolute just saps.
[261:01.78]Herbadoo Daily Moisturizer?
[261:03.88]What?
[261:10.38]I don't know.
[261:10.70]I don't know what that was.
[261:11.76]What's that supposed to be?
[261:15.52]It's crashing.
[261:17.19]Hold on to your stance.
[261:19.01]Take a deep breath as you jump.
[261:20.77]What was that?
[261:21.31]What was that?
[261:34.44]This show was awesome on Nickelodeon, by the way.
[261:39.48]That was crazy.
[261:40.19]Oh, God.
[262:05.25]Shit!
[262:07.43]Show's over.
[262:10.60]Alright, we're... We've got, I think, two more videos left.
[262:16.06]I have no idea what they are.
[262:25.40]Oh, fuck you.
[262:26.28]Nope.
[262:41.22]Okay, bye.
[262:42.46]And now back to George Lopez.
[262:46.90]Awkward carpool.
[262:59.29]Wait, did I change sides that I was driving on?
[263:02.97]Yes!
[263:04.06]Oh, I had a long day at work.
[263:06.10]Let's go.
[263:11.60]That's unbelievable.
[263:12.17]This road sucks.
[263:21.97]Okay.
[263:26.22]You do drugs?
[263:31.76]Yep.
[263:34.37]I heard it's really, really good.
[263:46.04]Why is he chained into the car?
[264:12.02]Guys, I don't want to break up your little fun little thing you've got going back in here, but we've got company.
[264:20.20]Oh my god.
[264:24.52]What happened to the footage?
[264:26.03]Spoo!
[264:48.97]This is the final video.
[265:09.13]Real tragedy.
[265:10.21]Alright.
[265:11.71]I hope you guys know what I'm talking about, though.
[265:13.95]Look, in my, like, CBD brain, did I come up, did you, did I, could you understand what I was saying?
[265:21.09]You do, right?
[265:21.72]Okay.
[265:23.68]Here's the final video.
[265:31.34]The Germable.
[265:33.42]Before we watch the final video, I want to say...
[265:36.34]Once again, that I am blown the fuck away by the insane amount of editing talent that a ton of you guys have.
[265:46.15]If you were to set up like a green screen thing in a lot of places on the internet, the amount of quality submissions, I mean, look at me, right?
[265:56.67]Look at you.
[265:58.94]I think this is top-notch shit right here.
[266:05.01]So seriously, thank you for all your submissions.
[266:07.74]There were hundreds and fucking hundreds and hundreds of them.
[266:11.14]And it's hard to cut stuff.
[266:14.52]If your video was not seen, that doesn't mean that the video sucked.
[266:18.49]We just tried to remove some things and shrink it down and condense it so it could be done over a couple of streams.
[266:24.89]This playlist is going to be available.
[266:28.15]I will give it to you.
[266:30.31]And then also, maybe at some point in the next week or so, we might do like an extended one.
[266:35.57]Just adding some of the other submissions that were there.
[266:39.95]And then you can watch.
[266:41.59]And then you can get arrested by Disney.
[266:44.01]On your own.
[266:44.40]So part three?
[266:51.14]No, not part three.
[266:53.96]I think from this point forward, we're going to take any of the new stuff that comes in and do community content stuff.
[267:00.52]And Community Content Night is going to be a lot different.
[267:05.36]A lot of the artwork is going to be put into BRB screens and at the end of the streams.
[267:11.72]I... I can't... It'd be impossible to catch up.
[267:18.30]Even if we did it like every other day or twice a week, three times a week, there's three months before I left of content.
[267:26.63]And then when I got back...
[267:28.92]You're talking about... I was... We were already two or three months behind.
[267:32.08]There's probably six months of artwork.
[267:36.32]And videos.
[267:38.48]So I have to think of a solution there how I'm going to do that.
[267:41.74]And the best one I can think of is... Because I don't want people to get community content exhaustion.
[267:47.56]It's one of the reasons why I broke this stream up into two.
[267:52.28]After, you know, four, five, six hours of... I don't want to just be scanning through pieces of artwork.
[267:59.60]three, four times a week.
[268:01.28]Because if people do an art, piece of art for this channel, I want someone to see it, and I want it obviously to be like, oh, well, look, that's cool.
[268:09.13]But I don't want to exhaust everybody with like, okay, we're gonna play a video game today, and then the next two days are gonna be artwork and videos.
[268:19.81]And I don't want me personally to be sitting there going, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.
[268:22.72]I gotta go fucking fast.
[268:23.66]There's 3,000 of these.
[268:25.89]Hey, thanks.
[268:26.45]Hey, thanks.
[268:26.93]Hey, thanks.
[268:27.41]Hey, thanks.
[268:27.89]No, I don't want to do that because obviously if you took the time to do it, I would want you to... I don't want to just skip through you.
[268:37.64]Play it already.
[268:39.06]We're going over the future of the community content stuff, man.
[268:41.42]Come on.
[268:44.78]Let's watch the last one.
[268:45.42]This is the Germable.
[268:47.56]And then I'll put the link in chat.
[268:50.19]And we will say our goodbyes.
[268:53.57]Thanks again, everybody.
[268:55.27]Excellent fucking work.
[268:57.03]You floor me every time.
[268:59.28]My face hurts.
[269:00.32]My chest hurts.
[269:01.54]Everything just hurts.
[269:02.24]I'm going to take a bath after this.
[269:05.76]Here we go.
[269:15.24]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is Anthony Wimbledon coming at you with a shoutcast on German 95's channel.
[269:20.62]I got a lot of requests to get back into this and do another shoutcast, so I'm going to start it.
[269:24.03]Here we go.
[269:24.35]One, two, three, four, five.
[269:25.19]Let's do it.
[269:26.33]Are you fucking serious right now?
[269:28.29]Oh, shit.
[269:28.69]Fuck off.
[269:44.58]Two for two.
[269:45.37]Two players.
[270:32.11]Wait, what?
[270:32.55]Okay, that's it.
[270:33.41]Okay.
[270:34.03]Ugh.
[271:02.25]Yeah, the playlist is in the chat right now.
[271:05.36]That was a ton of fun.
[271:07.70]It saddens me that this is the second and final part one and then part two.
[271:16.62]But that doesn't mean we won't do this again.
[271:22.43]I think every year or two, going in front of the screen and doing a ton more stuff,
[271:29.35]I'm cool with that.
[271:31.09]And then obviously stuff for community content.
[271:33.58]Nights and purposes.
[271:34.28]Yes.
[271:35.76]That was awesome.
[271:38.26]I will see you guys.
[271:42.58]Very soon.
[271:44.40]I will see you on.
[271:45.34]Let's see.
[271:45.81]Saturday.
[271:46.83]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[271:49.29]And Wednesday.
[271:52.35]Wednesday and Thursday back to back.
[271:53.79]We're going to do 3DO.
[271:57.23]I have about 40 games for the 3DO.
[272:01.21]It's going to be a shit show.
[272:02.61]So Wednesday and Thursday of this coming week, 3DO.
[272:08.03]And then Sunday is FTK.
[272:14.23]Sunday the 13th at 3pm Pacific is FTK.
[272:18.82]On the stream on Wednesday or Thursday, I'm going to give a ton of details for it.
[272:22.78]And we're going to start preparing the servers for it and everything.
[272:28.76]That's the plan for this coming week.
[272:32.46]There were a shitload of subs that just came in.
[272:34.93]First of all, thank you UndeadKi-chan.
[272:38.41]Thanks for the 20 community subs.
[272:39.63]It's a lot of fucking money.

[273:04.57]I'll figure it out.
[273:08.93]We'll get it.
[273:09.25]We'll fit it in there somewhere.
[273:10.13]Don't worry.
[273:10.43]We'll fit it in.
[273:14.73]But Jake, they said it's my birthday today.
[273:16.45]I want to share my appreciation for all the shit you do.
[273:20.73]Well, today and last weekend had nothing to do with what I did.
[273:25.76]Sure, I stood in front of the screen and did all the stuff, but I didn't make these videos.
[273:30.77]So, thanks, guys.
[273:34.57]Happy birthday to you, Jake, as well.
[273:37.91]10 subs from MechaMurph, 5 from Melonhead, and that catches us up there.
