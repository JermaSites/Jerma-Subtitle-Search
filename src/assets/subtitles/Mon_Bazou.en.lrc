[00:10.85]Okay, that's better.
[00:11.55]I've been talking this whole time, by the way.
[00:14.09]Um, I've been muted the whole time.
[00:17.25]My, uh, GoXLR was not activated for some reason.
[00:21.55]So let me restart that.
[00:22.61]Let me do the whole thing.
[00:23.33]Let me do that entire, like, four... I was wondering what he was reacting to what I was saying.
[00:28.08]What I was saying was... Hi.
[00:30.62]How are you?
[00:32.78]Uh, I need a better title.
[00:33.70]Like, I was freaking out about the title, because the title was awful.
[00:35.88]It was like a placeholder for when I got here.
[00:39.38]But anyways people saying 420 420 listen.
[00:41.30]I don't I don't let the calendar dictate when I'm gonna fucking smoke, okay?
[00:50.54]I don't I don't pick when I'm gonna get high based on what calendar day it is But frankly I don't even know how to type on the keyboard right now.
[01:00.31]I have absolutely no idea where I am I'm sober as a fucking stone right now.
[01:05.47]Okay relax.
[01:06.43]I'm not high I
[01:09.48]I'm completely fine.
[01:11.50]Guys, I know that's a meme on the channel at this point.
[01:15.33]No, I'm not.
[01:18.03]I don't know.
[01:26.58]This music doesn't help, by the way.
[01:28.54]Not the one you're hearing now.
[01:29.60]This one.
[01:33.32]Bro, I promise, it's 420, but I haven't done anything.
[01:37.55]And yes, this is admissible in whatever court you want to hold this up.
[01:43.35]Yeah.
[01:46.01]This is the background music from Mon Bizao.
[01:48.93]Mon Bizao.
[01:49.91]How do you say this?
[01:50.55]Mon Bonzo?
[01:52.05]Bonzao?
[01:54.04]Give it to me so I don't fuck it up the rest of the stream.
[01:55.78]How do I say it?
[01:59.90]mon bazoo mon bozo mon bazoo mon bazoo mon bazoo okay I got it uh but yeah no I'm not high on 420 I'm sorry sorry about that
[02:20.33]I do think I may have come up with a really cool... No, no, I need a title.
[02:23.33]Stop making... I don't want to go off on a tangent.
[02:25.57]What?
[02:25.77]A title.
[02:27.59]Mon Bazoo?
[02:28.85]What's a good title?
[02:29.41]What's going to grab people?
[02:30.63]What's going to grab them?
[02:35.36]How do I feel today?
[02:35.98]I feel okay.
[02:38.30]We'll see as we go on.
[02:39.84]Honestly, I think it might have been a seasonal thing.
[02:46.10]Over the last couple weeks here in Vegas, it's been ridiculously windy.
[02:52.72]Three or four, five days a week over the last like two and a half weeks.
[02:56.66]It's been like 30, 40 plus mile per hour winds every, like every other day.
[02:59.63]So I'm imagining with the seasonal change and all the crazy wind, maybe it's kicked up a bunch of bullshit.
[03:06.07]I don't know.
[03:12.01]Okay, how about, uh... Let's drive.
[03:17.02]Does anybody really care about my titles at this point?
[03:21.44]Almost 12 years later.
[03:27.33]Imagine needing to come up with a title for your book.
[03:32.87]4,000 times.
[03:33.83]You know what I mean?
[03:40.52]I have 1,000 videos I've uploaded on YouTube over like 5 plus years ago, right?
[03:44.20]Like 10, 12, 11, 12 years ago or whatever.
[03:46.84]I've streamed like fucking 1,000, 2,000 times.
[03:52.09]I'm talking about 2,000 to 3,000 book titles.
[03:56.29]They can't all be good.
[03:57.47]In fact, half of them weren't.
[03:58.62]So, whatever.
[03:59.12]How about Let's Drive?
[04:02.44]That's fine.
[04:03.08]Doesn't matter.
[04:03.64]My titles are awful anyways.
[04:04.68]Just make it car.
[04:15.37]No, Let's Drive is fine.
[04:16.31]Let me tweet, too.
[04:18.23]Oh, also, I think I've got something interesting.
[04:23.29]So, I didn't want to be late today, and I had to go to the bathroom.
[04:28.15]So, I think I came up with a really cool thing.
[04:31.55]You can call me a weirdo if you want, but that's fine.
[04:34.23]So, I like to have a coffee before I stream, just like a little, like an espresso, or like one, just a coffee to get me kind of going.
[04:41.51]And I had to go to the bathroom really bad.
[04:45.25]So, I drank an espresso while I took a shit today.
[04:53.20]was kind of cool I kind of liked it I don't know why is that like weird I mean that's kind of weird but like what there was I wasn't anything wrong with it but one of my mods just I think freaked out you cannot tell chat certain details of your life it's okay
[05:24.19]You know, over the years... Like, I've got these great mods, right, that help out a ton.
[05:31.77]There's lots of people in this community that help out that spend a ton of their time, you know, hitting me up about stuff and helping me do things and all this, right?
[05:38.93]They're awesome.
[05:40.31]I have a manager, right?
[05:41.45]I've got a production manager.
[05:43.85]I'm starting to realize that, like, a lot of people try... Like, hey, hey, dude, dude, dude, hey, tone it down because, like, what you just said is fucking weird.
[05:51.64]I never had this kind of feedback.
[05:56.00]I just kind of was weird to you guys.
[05:58.15]And everyone was, I just thought like it was normal.
[06:02.97]Community Jake will kind of give me some, like, hey, did you happen to say this the other day?
[06:10.21]Yeah.
[06:11.47]Don't say that.
[06:12.67]Okay.
[06:12.79]It doesn't happen that often, but it happens like enough for me to realize that like, hey, should I have told everybody that I drink an espresso while I take shit?
[06:25.37]But that, I'm, okay.
[06:27.39]I fuck around a lot on stream.
[06:28.99]I do.
[06:29.74]I tell fucking stories, we make up jokes, we make a bunch of shit up, we just have fun.
[06:33.56]That's the whole point of this stream.
[06:35.44]But in between the nonsense, like, I'm telling you some truths.
[06:39.62]And this is true.
[06:42.34]This is not like, oh, he's making that up for like a funny bit on stream, right?
[06:45.58]A lot of times it is that.
[06:46.54]You'll hear me, we go over all kinds of weird shit, right?
[06:50.06]I brewed an espresso today, and I shit while I drank the espresso.
[06:55.88]And I felt like I couldn't, I had to tell somebody that.
[06:58.10]I couldn't lie about that.
[06:59.22]I couldn't like pretend that didn't happen.
[07:03.58]I could not pretend it didn't happen.
[07:05.24]You know, I like have to confess to somebody.
[07:07.65]And you guys are some of the first people that I've seen or talked to today.
[07:17.31]Holly doesn't even know this.
[07:22.31]I didn't have like time to explain it.
[07:25.99]I didn't have time to tell Holly this stuff.
[07:29.49]But, you know.
[07:30.35]No.
[07:36.03]Alright, so we're gonna do Mon Baisao.
[07:41.05]Mon Bazoo.
[07:45.07]And the whole time I was doing it... I'm just tweeting, just relax.
[07:47.26]I'm here all day.
[07:49.56]The entire time I was doing it, I kept saying to myself...
[07:54.52]I don't know.
[07:54.78]It was almost like I was doing it.
[07:56.18]I was like, oh, this is weird what I'm doing, but I think it's cool.
[08:05.64]I was holding the espresso cup cool, coolly.
[08:10.40]I had it tilted in my left hand.
[08:12.29]I'm just sitting there acting cool.
[08:15.63]There's nobody.
[08:16.23]Who cares?
[08:16.75]I don't know why I was doing it.
[08:22.00]Okay, uh, Mon?
[08:23.14]I was just gonna say car game.
[08:24.98]Car driving game.
[08:25.78]How do you spell it?
[08:29.80]B-A?
[08:30.76]Zoo?
[08:34.61]What about a cigarette?
[08:48.17]B-A?
[08:48.37]How do you spell it?
[08:49.33]B-A?
[08:49.61]B-A what?
[08:52.13]Cigarettes on the toilet.
[08:53.41]No, I wouldn't... Okay, even if I did smoke, I would never smoke in my house.
[08:56.77]Or in my apartment or anything.
[08:59.13]That shit... No, that builds up and... No, that's gross.
[09:01.67]I'm smoking in a house.
[09:02.65]No, thank you.
[09:07.58]Okay, Mon... Nobody has told me how to spell this yet.
[09:14.16]I guess I could just look over here, couldn't I?
[09:15.66]There it is.
[09:17.74]Mon...
[09:20.20]Uh, people asking, uh, enough, like, fucking around.
[09:22.06]People are asking how I'm doing.
[09:23.02]I'm okay.
[09:24.66]I just figured I could stream.
[09:25.82]I didn't want to... If I got up today and spent the day kind of figuring out how I felt and I feel fine, then I'm not just going to be like, Oh, guys, um... I can't stream today.
[09:38.84]It would be bullshit, so... Because I told you I wanted to stream today.
[09:45.21]Okay, let's do it.
[09:58.16]Alright.
[09:59.18]Real voice.
[09:59.60]Yeah.
[10:00.04]We good to go?
[10:03.85]I think we're good to go.
[10:04.41]I opened the game just to see if it worked.
[10:10.97]And by the way, you get a facecam if you've done your homework.
[10:14.73]Which I can't confirm that you have.
[10:26.70]Alright.
[10:27.78]This is Mon Bazoo.
[10:35.95]So those of you wondering what this game is, it's a game where you have to fix and build a car and then race the car.
[10:44.77]It's kind of like... I don't know.
[10:47.33]We'll see.
[10:49.89]What kind of shirt should I have?
[10:54.69]I don't know.
[10:55.05]What color?
[10:55.99]Okay.
[10:56.47]I'm kind of a gray Andy.
[11:00.34]That's it.
[11:01.14]80% of my wardrobe is gray and dark blue.
[11:09.34]Okay.
[11:09.64]Let's see.
[11:10.12]How do I... Is there a punch?
[11:12.04]I can go to sleep, but I don't think I should probably... I shouldn't do that right now.
[11:18.71]No, I mean, unless we can confirm that chat has done their homework for tomorrow, I'm not turning the facecam on.
[11:25.48]I don't have any electricity?
[11:26.58]What?
[11:29.66]No water.
[11:32.56]There's no water and no electricity in the house.
[11:38.43]Mods, can you do a quick poll that says, did you finish your homework?
[11:43.01]And if it's more than... I'm not going to tell you the percentage that I have in my head, but just run it.
[11:47.81]Cannabis packager?
[11:49.85]Calm yourself, you need to sit down to use the pack- wait.
[11:53.32]Weed grinder?
[11:55.66]Oh, it's Easter!
[11:56.60]I forgot it's a happy Easter!
[11:57.74]Isn't- was yesterday, the day before.
[11:59.00]There's E to use.
[12:08.06]There's a total of zero pack of joint close by.
[12:11.52]There's no harvest basket.
[12:12.90]You want to try to roll air?
[12:14.04]Okay.
[12:21.05]Should I do the Easter stuff first?
[12:24.53]How do I stand up?
[12:27.35]Okay.
[12:28.72]Should I get the Easter stuff first?
[12:29.70]Okay, so mouse scroll is to move it around.
[12:36.14]Can I open the fridge?
[12:39.22]Oh, shit.
[12:39.74]What's in here?
[12:40.12]I thought this was ground beef.
[12:45.93]Yeah, don't lie.
[12:46.53]Seriously.
[12:50.07]Boutine?
[12:50.31]Boutine?
[12:51.59]And maple syrup.
[12:54.59]Maple syrup, poutine, energy, anxiety.
[12:56.43]Alright, well, let's... I'm not doing that yet.
[13:00.14]Is this a Canadian game?
[13:03.24]I guess it is, judging by that.
[13:06.30]Okay.
[13:14.04]Let's go out here.
[13:22.78]This item can't be recycled.
[13:25.52]So I have a truck?
[13:28.94]Can I go in the car?
[13:34.41]What am I supposed to do?
[13:52.62]Is it in drive?
[13:57.70]Where's drive?
[14:00.82]I don't know manual transmission, guys.
[14:03.86]Where's drive?
[14:04.28]This is four-wheel and two-wheel.
[14:08.07]Is this in drive?
[14:08.71]What is drive?
[14:09.97]It's a manual?
[14:10.53]I don't know how to drive a manual.
[14:14.23]Oh, the parking brake was on.
[14:19.33]The parking brake was on.
[14:22.52]Okay, wait, what am I supposed to do?
[14:35.17]Okay.
[14:36.35]Um... Do I have a map?
[14:42.37]You're a 15-year-old.
[14:43.45]I do not... Guys, I drive a car every day, alright?
[14:49.65]You... I'm turning the cam on for this.
[14:55.14]If you give a video game to your parents, and you say, hey, mom, dad, I want you to drive around in this car game, okay?
[15:07.27]Your parents, even though they drive fucking 80 hours a week, whatever it is, I drive like 100 fucking hours a week.
[15:16.46]Probably like, no, way less than that.
[15:20.43]If you put a couple thousand miles a month on a car, which is probably like 100 hours a month, I don't know, whatever it is, your parents are going to sit there and go like, this just doesn't make any sense to me.
[15:35.24]Junior, how do I do this?
[15:38.14]And your fucking mother drives you wherever you want, right?
[15:41.04]She has for years.
[15:42.08]My parents did for years.
[15:43.69]They're not going to know what the fuck they're doing.
[15:44.89]They're going to have absolutely no idea what to do.
[15:49.34]My dad used to, we would, when GTA 3, GTA 4, whatever it was.
[15:53.88]GTA 3.
[15:55.32]I would watch him play it.
[15:56.98]And he would be sitting there going like this with the controller in his hand.
[16:00.39]Like, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[16:02.43]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[16:04.93]What, I just hit that person.
[16:07.17]And he would just drive into walls and shit.
[16:08.69]And this guy, this guy like commuted every day.
[16:12.42]So, come on.
[16:14.60]You can't give me that much shit about this.
[16:28.89]Order the four-wheel drive and get out of here.
[16:34.49]Okay, for the love of God, I don't... I don't even need this truck anyways, I don't care.
[16:46.41]Need to reverse?
[16:47.69]I've... What does this take place, in fucking Europe or something?
[16:52.25]Like, hold on, let me see what this car is.
[16:55.68]Okay.
[16:58.13]Alright, here we go.
[16:59.65]A car.
[17:01.15]Reverse neutral drive.
[17:02.37]What the hell is going on in that truck?
[17:11.98]Oh, okay.
[17:13.92]Why do I not have electricity?
[17:20.18]Hey, what does this mean?
[17:21.24]I've never driven one of these before.
[17:40.36]Okay.
[17:43.24]So let me, can I even?
[17:44.86]God damn it, I think I have to restart the game.
[17:48.18]Why would this, why is there a ditch right here?
[17:50.25]I can't.
[17:56.23]Okay, what is reverse in a truck like this?
[17:58.99]Four-wheel drive.
[17:59.79]This, this one, two, three, four.
[18:06.51]What's, what's reverse?
[18:07.28]Reverse.
[18:11.75]Three, two, one.
[18:15.19]Where is the shift?
[18:25.40]He's a city boy.
[18:27.16]Honestly, God, where's reverse?
[18:31.94]Is that pedal right there reverse?
[18:36.56]Oh, my fucking God.
[18:37.62]Okay, I don't... What are you...
[18:44.20]It's not clearly labeled.
[18:45.36]Alright, I'm just gonna go.
[18:52.94]What am I looking for?
[18:53.56]Alright, where am I right now?
[18:57.26]I have a hundred bucks.
[19:03.19]Where am I?
[19:11.85]He's driving with his knees.
[19:16.47]Crash incoming.
[19:17.51]I just don't know where I am.
[19:19.03]Do I have an indicator on the map of where I am?
[19:22.89]Where's my house?
[19:26.51]Okay, I see the wind turbines.
[19:34.26]How much gas do I have?
[19:36.26]Half tank.
[19:52.36]This is not even possible!
[19:54.84]What?
[19:55.06]Put it in forward drive quick!
[20:11.34]My anxiety went up.
[20:15.19]Come on, go!
[20:15.99]Alright, I'm fine.
[20:20.03]Um...
[20:25.00]Uh, sigh.
[20:25.70]Another fall joke.
[20:27.36]Okay, so that's the river.
[20:28.26]Hold on.
[20:32.14]I need to get, like, a better view.
[20:33.32]Should I have it in four-wheel drive in four?
[20:43.90]Well, I'm off-roading right now.
[20:44.90]That's fine.
[20:46.30]Okay.
[20:59.38]This is old Jerma.
[21:00.46]I got... I don't fucking know what to do.
[21:07.33]I don't know where I am in the game and I don't have any instructions.
[21:10.35]Okay, here's the wind and this is a road, right?
[21:27.71]Alright, so this road has to be... Alright, just stop the fucking car.
[21:31.59]Turn the fucking car off.
[21:32.25]Why doesn't it break?
[21:48.52]Dude, why do I have to play, like, fucking ping pong to put the car in park?
[21:51.52]Does this car even have a park?
[22:05.54]Okay, I see the wind turbines.
[22:09.17]So I need, do I have like a compass?
[22:17.53]I don't know what direction I'm facing.
[22:18.89]I'm on this road that's on that kind of right side there where the wind turbines are.
[22:24.23]I guess I could follow the road down to go to this parfait.
[22:32.25]I'll try that.
[22:32.64]I'm just going to follow the road.
[22:42.23]He's an automatic Andy.
[22:44.50]Okay, how many people here?
[22:46.12]There are 13,000 people here.
[22:47.38]I guarantee you.
[22:49.48]I guarantee you only like eight of you know how to drive a manual.
[22:53.70]I'm serious.
[22:58.43]What is wrong with the car?
[23:17.03]Yeah, how many of you guys know how to drive a manual?
[23:19.61]Fucking none of you.
[23:22.39]The parking brake is on.
[23:27.91]Oh, did they do their homework?
[23:32.06]I didn't even look.
[23:32.72]Did they do their homework?
[23:33.40]Okay, here's the split.
[23:38.28]I need to go to the right?
[23:41.90]Or left?
[23:42.40]I think to the left.
[23:56.12]Okay.
[24:00.50]You need to shift up, please.
[24:03.64]I got it.
[24:07.23]It's Monday at 1230.
[24:07.97]You're gonna stall out the engine.
[24:14.93]I don't drive trucks.
[24:25.04]Shift to second.
[24:26.18]Shift.
[24:30.14]I don't want to go that fast on this road.
[24:32.10]Don't you understand?
[24:35.72]Oh, shit.
[24:36.36]What's this?
[24:38.38]The brake, please.
[24:41.60]What's going on here?
[24:42.24]Is this on the map?
[24:47.39]Um... I need to call them.
[24:53.47]Where's my phone?
[24:54.05]Do I have an inventory?
[24:56.59]Do I have a phone?
[24:57.01]Do I have a telephone?
[25:11.86]What did I just spit?
[25:15.82]What the hell was that?
[25:16.62]Alright, let me look at the controls for a second.
[25:18.58]I don't know what anything does.
[25:22.64]smoke say sorry say a french slur spit okay I don't think I have a telephone okay can I get around this
[25:54.56]I don't think I have a, uh, a phone here.
[25:59.90]Alright, one, two, there we go.
[26:02.96]Dash is reverse, and then I have all the gears.
[26:05.16]There we go.
[26:05.66]I don't have to look down off the road.
[26:07.14]Alright.
[26:07.80]So, I can't go here for a while.
[26:12.38]So, let's put it in reverse.
[26:13.81]Let's get out of here.
[26:26.11]What the fuck is happening?
[26:30.43]God damn it.
[26:31.61]Who uses that?
[26:33.39]Guys, I haven't... I'm sorry.
[26:34.65]I'm not in a Ford commercial.
[26:36.59]I haven't used my parking brake to park on a hill in the entire time I've ever owned and operated a vehicle.
[26:50.10]Can we get facecam back?
[26:52.18]Okay, you can.
[26:54.68]Alright, so...
[26:56.62]I can't go that way.
[26:57.40]I wish there was a little blip where I was.
[27:00.10]I'm gonna go back and go left.
[27:03.08]I'm gonna run out of gas too.
[27:05.04]This is gonna be a disaster.
[27:05.94]Oh, what's this?
[27:16.22]Jim's U-pull.
[27:21.34]How do I get in here?
[27:21.82]Can I get in?
[27:28.61]Is this on the map?
[27:31.65]Jim's U-Poll.
[27:36.31]It's not on the map.
[27:50.92]You're not friend enough with Jack to get here.
[27:56.78]Oh, Auel Don't Jacques.
[27:58.50]Am I up there?
[27:59.00]Top right?
[28:00.04]Hit Y. I think I'm up in the top right.
[28:12.55]So if I go this way, I should hit Parfait.
[28:15.98]I don't even know how to go home.
[28:23.38]So this is
[28:26.38]Alright, so if I go, if I just keep going this way, I'll end up at Parfait, right?
[28:31.69]I think that's what's gonna happen.
[28:32.57]Let's find out.
[28:33.47]Turn the webcam on.
[28:51.58]Okay.
[28:54.23]Do I have like an objective list?
[28:59.91]Fucking God, I am never going to get over that.
[29:01.93]I'm going to have the parking brake on every time.
[29:11.48]So let's keep going this way.
[29:15.24]What does the maple syrup indicator mean?
[29:20.93]Why do you look like that?
[29:23.34]Because I turn 40.
[29:25.46]Probably before you are like 25.
[29:28.74]Okay?
[29:29.12]I'm hungry?
[29:37.29]Oh, shit.
[29:37.83]Okay.
[29:43.63]There's no damage.
[29:44.23]It doesn't matter.
[29:54.18]Alright, we're at a split here.
[29:55.44]So what does this look like on the road?
[30:00.93]Alright.
[30:02.31]So if I go right, I'm going to go over to... Jeveau?
[30:07.47]If I go left, I'm going to go down until I hit another split, and then I'm going to go right.
[30:11.97]Where do I want to go?
[30:12.55]I don't even know how to get back to the house.
[30:24.33]Go to the city.
[30:25.81]Okay, so to go to the city, I want to go left.
[30:31.33]And then drive until I hit another kind of fork.
[30:35.35]And I want to go right at the fork.
[30:37.47]Right?
[30:39.02]I want to go left here.
[30:43.22]Right?
[30:43.56]Please help me.
[30:49.48]I should go home and eat.
[30:57.81]Yeah, you left here and then keep making rights.
[30:59.89]Yeah, that's what I figured.
[31:01.14]Hopefully I have enough gas to get there.
[31:05.92]Go left and drive past two rights, then right.
[31:14.32]Alright, here it is, here it is, here it is.
[31:15.54]So go... Keep going on...
[31:24.60]It's not on the map.
[31:26.40]Left is right.
[31:27.66]Left.
[31:31.68]And then... I can't read this map.
[31:41.80]Turn right.
[31:43.52]I think you're lost, bro.
[31:44.88]I am.
[31:45.30]I just... I don't know how I even got over here.
[31:47.00]Is that... Okay.
[31:53.19]Arriette.
[31:58.55]Oh shit!
[31:58.95]There's the town, right there.
[32:07.36]Alright, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta to the road, I gotta to the road.
[32:16.23]Right?
[32:27.89]Oh, okay.
[32:28.31]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[32:29.07]It's not a driving game.
[32:30.33]I mean, it is, but you know what I mean.
[32:34.19]Alright, so I made it to the town.
[32:35.20]What is here?
[32:35.52]Is this where I came from?
[32:47.40]What's here?
[32:49.42]We work on the farm.
[32:50.42]Serve yourself.
[32:55.49]I got a potato?
[32:58.66]I have a to-do list.
[32:59.47]What did I get?
[32:59.87]What do you mean to-do list?
[33:00.95]How did I get a to-do list?
[33:09.44]Curd's Cheese Pack?
[33:26.81]Okay.
[33:27.95]Remember to pay.
[33:28.75]I think I am.
[33:29.53]I've spent 20 bucks.
[33:31.65]I need gas, too, for my truck.
[33:34.65]This is gonna fall out.
[33:37.71]What is that thing?
[33:44.39]Alright, I think I'm good.
[33:46.83]I need a gas station.
[33:55.98]They're still in there.
[33:58.16]Alright, gas station.
[33:59.23]What does that sign say?
[34:12.18]Your cam is blocking.
[34:13.15]Oh.
[34:13.49]Where should I put it?
[34:23.37]I don't see a gas station in this town.
[34:25.03]And let me see the map.
[34:26.19]I am, like, in that upper left quadrant, right?
[34:32.16]Oh, what's this?
[34:32.86]Can somebody, like, fuck the car?
[34:42.40]Uh-oh.
[34:42.78]Post box.
[34:47.76]Do I have a mailbox?
[34:52.49]I don't think I have a mailbox.
[34:55.71]How do I get to my, like, to-do list?
[34:57.01]I don't even know what that was.
[35:01.23]I... Quest... Friendships.
[35:09.99]Okay.
[35:10.97]Brother, gas... Gas owner, and mom.
[35:14.39]How do I pull up... Why?
[35:15.59]How do I pull up the quest menu?
[35:21.21]Every time you clear your throat, I'm gonna play one game of Hearthstone.
[35:37.40]Snack delivery?
[35:38.36]Oh.
[35:42.46]I need to figure out how to get back to the fucking house.
[35:47.85]You know, I'm just gonna walk around.
[35:50.00]What's the point of wasting gas?
[35:54.08]Okay, snack delivery.
[35:59.80]Five dollars for poutine.
[36:04.98]Oh, I just ate it.
[36:05.54]Alright, cool.
[36:06.72]So, I just ate.
[36:08.88]I wish I could, like, fucking mark on the map where this is.
[36:11.08]I think it's the... The one that's circled ten out of ten, right?
[36:22.22]So if I'm right there, I wish I had a, just knew where I was, what direction I was facing.
[36:26.00]Okay, let's get in here.
[36:31.12]So I now need to eat or drink maple syrup.
[36:33.67]Is that how that works?
[36:39.45]You haven't had an egg snack?
[36:44.83]Other car located.
[36:54.32]Is this a gas station?
[36:56.36]Ooh!
[36:57.72]Alright.
[36:58.50]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[36:59.96]I found something.
[37:02.94]How much is gas?
[37:07.88]Nice weather we have today.
[37:10.14]Yes.
[37:10.38]Well, anyways, thanks for stopping by.
[37:11.36]Have a nice one.
[37:11.90]This is all so expensive.
[37:17.74]What am I supposed to do with this?
[37:18.51]Coffee cup?
[37:23.13]Eyelashes?
[37:26.90]Hold on.
[37:27.48]I can put car eyelashes on?
[37:30.58]Alright.
[37:30.86]Wait.
[37:31.06]I want this.
[37:31.48]Okay.
[37:44.47]What do you... Norman.
[37:47.47]Leave me alone with the racetrack.
[37:50.09]What else do I need here?
[37:57.92]Okay.
[38:02.22]So this is where you get the equipment.
[38:04.10]Window tint?
[38:05.76]You have green windows?
[38:06.60]What do you think?
[38:09.42]I probably shouldn't spend any more money, to be honest.
[38:16.27]This is unique.
[38:20.11]How do I store this stuff?
[38:27.98]I don't know what this is.
[38:30.10]I'm taking this, whatever it is, though.
[38:43.82]I don't know what any of this stuff does, but I'm just going to take as much free stuff as I can fit in the trunk.
[38:47.81]Because I don't know what this stuff does, and I need to put gas in the car, too.
[38:52.07]What about over here?
[38:52.55]What's this?
[38:54.31]Mixing paint?
[38:56.03]$30 per can.
[38:56.81]What the fuck?
[39:08.78]This is stealing.
[39:11.54]I'm... I mean... This should be fine.
[39:15.74]Can I take anything else?
[39:20.06]Alright, I gotta remember where this is.
[39:22.43]I need to start to put this into long-term memory, because I'm gonna drive around in a gosh darn circle.
[39:26.37]We're almost 45 minutes in without a funny joke.
[39:29.55]You missed when I flipped the truck 400 times and went in the ocean.
[39:33.15]Sorry.
[39:33.63]Sorry you came late to the stream.
[39:44.04]Alright, so now, let me close this and put some gas in the car.
[39:50.49]I probably shouldn't be on four-wheel drive either, right?
[39:53.89]I get $36.
[39:58.08]What side is the gas tank on?
[40:00.06]Left side.
[40:22.27]Okay.
[40:22.43]What?
[40:24.35]What do you mean the store is closed?
[40:28.79]What are you talking about?
[40:33.96]Can I sleep in the trunk?
[40:39.78]Do I even have enough gas to get back?
[40:50.93]How do I get, how do I get home, okay?
[40:55.48]Where's my house?
[40:57.32]I, from here.
[40:58.56]Can you guys please direct me?
[41:02.88]You actually, I actually don't know, Wald.
[41:08.06]So, if I'm on that top left kind of quadrant over here, and my house is across the kind of lake down, right?
[41:22.81]Just go right.
[41:23.57]Just take rights, okay?
[41:27.72]I don't have enough gas to fucking get out of here.
[41:29.38]I'm just gonna sit here.
[41:41.92]Just sit at the window.
[41:43.34]Like this.
[42:01.75]Can you get hit by a car?
[42:04.87]How long does it take to get to the morning?
[42:08.31]Go to the church.
[42:09.85]I don't have enough gas to go... This is gonna be a fucking disaster.
[42:13.45]Because you understand... I am... Look at my gas tank.
[42:18.48]How do I zoom in?
[42:23.38]I'm not gonna get anywhere.
[42:25.58]Walk to the church.
[42:26.96]God, I'm gonna forget where the fuck this is.
[42:30.14]Alright, I'm going to church.
[42:39.61]That's gross.
[42:45.89]I can't, I don't even think there's a run.
[42:51.87]This is making me think of the hot dog guy.
[42:55.05]I'm just saying.
[42:55.77]I can do it quick.
[42:59.67]It's in the air and it comes back down.
[43:04.21]Fastest hot dog shooter.
[43:06.43]I've never seen anybody do it like this in the northwest.
[43:08.10]I don't know.
[43:11.32]This is closed.
[43:13.68]I'm actually just gonna be walking around till it's dawn.
[43:20.21]I've seen- oh, I thought you said you've never seen that video.
[43:22.61]You know what's really wild, thinking about that?
[43:28.37]There's not, I think, a person on Earth that has not seen the fastest lockdown shooter video.
[43:38.23]Imagine knowing that every single person on Earth has seen that video, and you're that guy.
[43:45.34]Every single person on Earth has seen that video.
[43:51.58]That's kind of crazy.
[43:57.34]Alright, I need to get out of here.
[43:58.46]Should I just restart the game?
[44:02.60]Go back to your truck, you're going to get robbed.
[44:04.57]Wait, you can get robbed?
[44:05.41]What?
[44:08.04]Are you serious?
[44:11.70]Yes?
[44:13.72]Oh my goodness.
[44:14.66]Don't even tell me.
[44:16.84]Do I have a weapon?
[44:17.47]I have a flashlight.
[44:22.83]How do I run?
[44:25.23]Excuse it.
[44:32.21]Slenderman.
[44:32.97]Alright, I went this way.
[44:40.22]Can I do AM PM?
[44:41.48]I don't like the 19... I like to see AM PM.
[44:58.24]I have to burn into memory how to get back here.
[45:01.47]Where the fuck am I going?
[45:02.23]Where's my truck?
[45:07.23]Is it the other way?
[45:13.59]Wasn't it right down this way from the church, or was it that way?
[45:22.12]Gas station.
[45:23.52]Was it this way?
[45:27.22]I'm so useless without a fucking map indicator, I swear to God.
[45:33.29]Where's the gas station from here?
[45:34.29]There's something behind you.
[45:36.91]There's nothing behind me, I'm fine.
[45:47.61]It was this way, wasn't it?
[45:50.77]Watch out.
[45:51.13]We literally saw it.
[45:52.05]There's no sprint either.
[45:54.43]I just missed it?
[45:59.22]I don't see it.
[46:00.64]Where is it?
[46:00.98]This is the snack place.
[46:10.29]Okay, so it's over here.
[46:18.59]Because remember, I go, I got a snack, ahaha, and then I kept going.
[46:21.33]There it is.
[46:27.92]What do you mean, did you not hear that?
[46:39.41]I don't hear anything.
[46:50.37]Holy fuck.
[46:50.95]What, what, what, what, what?
[46:51.93]I'm in the car, I'm safe.
[47:05.21]Drive, drive, drive!
[47:06.25]Alright, alright, alright!
[47:07.09]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[47:21.72]I can't read that.
[47:44.37]Take the bus.
[47:48.65]It's almost midnight.
[47:49.57]Get out of here.
[47:50.25]I don't...
[47:52.69]You guys are fucking with me.
[47:54.05]I'm hearing, like, sound.
[47:54.95]Okay, should I just go this way?
[47:56.17]How do I turn my headlights on?
[48:07.80]How do I turn the headlights on?
[48:09.60]Okay, I need to use a flashlight.
[48:11.68]I don't know.
[48:12.26]How do you turn on headlights?
[48:15.38]Can you fucking imagine?
[48:19.68]Holding a flashlight to drive?
[48:38.46]What's that say?
[49:07.60]Guys, there's no car light.
[49:17.82]Oh, there we go.
[49:18.24]I got it.
[49:19.87]Okay.
[49:33.29]If I follow this road, am I going to end up
[49:42.37]Okay, this is residential.
[49:47.21]Do the Jerma985 here a bit.
[49:49.23]I can't do that right now.
[49:51.33]Don't stop at the barn.
[49:52.33]Run.
[49:53.35]Am I on the right track?
[49:54.19]Okay.
[50:11.81]I can't.
[50:12.31]These lights are terrible.
[50:23.83]I can't take a left because of this stupid ditch.
[50:26.62]I have to find the road where there's no ditch.
[50:30.96]Right here.
[50:36.18]Be honest, am I actually going on the right?
[50:48.02]All my shit just fell out.
[50:50.88]I'm restarting the game.
[50:53.06]I'm gonna restart the whole game.
[50:55.45]I'm restarting the whole game.
[50:57.55]Now I get it.
[50:58.07]Now I understand what's going on.
[50:58.87]I'm restarting the game.
[51:00.81]I'm just gonna restart.
[51:01.53]Just redo the game.
[51:03.51]Just restart.
[51:04.01]I'm restarting.
[51:06.79]Yeah.
[51:07.15]Yes.
[51:07.49]I quit.
[51:08.45]New game.
[51:12.30]Okay, now I get it.
[51:21.85]Okay, where's my... Alright.
[51:24.07]Where am I on the map?
[51:28.90]So this is my truck, this is the car.
[51:33.04]I have to, like, do work to this car, right?
[51:36.25]I need a tire?
[51:36.95]How do I get to the task menu?
[51:41.27]Does it even exist?
[51:42.03]There's a map?
[51:51.61]I don't think there is.
[51:52.45]Go to the shed.
[51:53.09]Throw.
[52:02.64]Okay.
[52:05.12]Build the sugar shack.
[52:06.66]Buy a roll of tubing.
[52:09.64]Connect ten maple trees to the shack.
[52:13.40]Okay.
[52:13.76]Build a sugar shack.
[52:19.09]Alright, here we go.
[52:20.17]Alright, okay.
[52:21.17]Alright.
[52:22.09]What the fuck was I driving around for no reason?
[52:25.19]Look.
[52:29.74]Okay, to do.
[52:32.92]Use the tool adjustable spanner to screw a bolt.
[52:34.94]Okay.
[52:40.67]Screw a bolt.
[52:44.29]Should I do that on the car?
[52:45.39]Like down here, right?
[52:46.01]Yep, okay.
[52:52.81]Very nice.
[52:53.21]Happy 420.
[52:55.70]Hey, happy 420, man.
[53:07.31]Yeah.
[53:08.71]One of those days.
[53:09.33]Can I store stuff?
[53:16.19]Make this easier.
[53:25.79]These are so rusty.
[53:26.66]Alright, put this here.
[53:35.20]Is this done?
[53:37.72]That.
[53:38.94]I was going to place all the screws first.
[53:40.96]And then maybe I can actually drive this fucking thing and actually drive an automatic car.
[53:46.53]Oh my god.
[53:47.57]Those things are the same color as the ground.
[53:51.53]Where are the screws?
[53:52.11]Where are the screws?
[53:56.99]Whatever.
[54:08.86]I'm not gonna... Why would I restart?
[54:09.78]I'm fine.
[54:11.88]I need one more.
[54:16.78]There we go.
[54:17.31]Okay, so now that I have the tire on... Does this thing have an engine?
[54:26.41]Very cool.
[54:28.60]Alright, so this is to do right now.
[54:32.87]Install the intake back on the engine.
[54:37.61]Intake.
[54:37.99]How do I open the hood?
[54:47.91]Do I need the wrench to do that?
[55:00.29]inside the car.
[55:05.65]Oh, there it is.
[55:06.03]Okay.
[55:17.17]Open the fucking hood!
[55:18.17]What happened to my wrench?
[55:28.51]How do I open the hood?
[55:30.78]You need to use the hoist.
[55:39.81]That work?
[55:42.83]What the f- Hoist puller.
[55:46.97]Place it on the ground.
[55:47.69]Catch it to vehicle.
[55:58.39]It was just a button, you fucking wackos!
[56:04.30]Whatever.
[56:04.64]Okay, do I have to screw it in?
[56:19.59]Oh, it's a generator.
[56:20.63]Alright, so what happened to the wrench that I had?
[56:26.27]Install the intake.
[56:27.33]Torque the wheels.
[56:30.69]Dude, I had a wrench.
[56:32.84]And it's just fucking gone.
[56:40.96]Where is my wrench?
[56:42.72]Is it right there?
[56:43.82]Where?
[56:44.24]Dude.
[56:53.81]Okay.
[57:01.13]I don't know where the wrench is.
[57:02.80]I have abso-fucking-lutely no idea.
[57:06.44]Do I not have like an inventory?
[57:10.57]Look down.
[57:30.58]Guys.
[57:34.40]It's not here.
[57:36.70]It's by the car?
[57:48.27]Bruh, I can't.
[57:55.66]It's not on the screen right now.
[57:57.62]I'm being dead serious.
[57:59.15]It's not on the screen.
[58:00.19]It's not on the screen.
[58:02.85]I dropped it somehow.
[58:04.17]Is it like in my hand?
[58:06.49]Is it like a wrench button that it's like I stored it?
[58:09.01]Look down.
[58:16.68]Dude, we're at a bird's eye view.
[58:18.54]The wrench is not on the ground.
[58:52.54]I think it fucking bugged.
[58:53.74]I don't think it's in the... I don't think it's here.
[58:55.20]I'm gonna sit right here and I want everybody just to fucking tell me exactly where to go from right here.
[59:04.89]I'm gonna wait 10 seconds every time I ask.
[59:14.73]Behind the shed.
[59:20.97]You motherfucker.
[59:22.29]You gotta be kidding me.
[59:23.73]It's... Yeah.
[59:25.61]I never stepped... I never went over there.
[59:28.74]I was never behind the shed.
[59:31.24]It bugged through the wall or something.
[59:33.02]Whatever.
[59:33.34]Who cares?
[59:33.72]Let's go.
[59:35.58]Alright.
[59:35.76]I need screws.
[59:37.82]I gotta screw this in, right?
[59:53.99]Short-term memory loss?
[59:54.83]I didn't even go back there, dude.
[59:58.11]Alright.
[59:58.59]How do I, um... Is it 12?
[60:00.51]Or is it just... Okay, there we go.
[60:03.73]Right there.
[60:04.13]That's in.
[60:09.62]I think I need, like, two or three.
[60:19.60]Bingo.
[60:21.30]What, one more?
[60:34.22]Okay.
[60:35.86]Need more?
[60:36.14]When are you going to play Strawberry Magic 2?
[60:39.28]Okay, the people that are disrespecting the streamer on telling me to play Strawberry Magic 2, I want them timed out.
[60:51.98]Um, is it in?
[60:56.24]I think it's in.
[61:00.34]Should I just close the hood?
[61:06.00]We good?
[61:18.27]How do I... How do I say, like, what else should I do?
[61:24.17]I screwed it in, and do I have to do anything else?
[61:28.79]Ogee part?
[61:30.37]Screws?
[61:31.63]I don't know how to, like, solidify this.
[61:34.27]I need more screws.
[61:35.00]Really?
[61:35.14]Really?
[61:39.69]Oh, I don't know.
[61:40.71]It's right below you.
[61:41.73]Yeah.
[61:50.67]It looks like there's no more screws I can put in.
[62:05.40]I don't think there's any more room for screws.
[62:07.48]How can I fit in here?
[62:10.39]It's screwed in.
[62:13.59]Are you mad at me?
[62:18.02]Look towards the black box?
[62:21.66]Oh, there we go.
[62:22.32]Okay.
[62:24.22]There it is.
[62:24.68]There's my, there's my mun, byzow.
[62:27.86]Okay, engine's in.
[62:30.36]Torque the wheels.
[62:34.54]I don't know what that means.
[62:47.03]That's what it wants me to do, right?
[62:57.11]City boy.
[62:57.69]None of you guys here know any of this shit either.
[63:02.11]Please.
[63:06.49]Some of you probably... Some of you that do are sitting there going, I do.
[63:10.78]You fucking bozo, right?
[63:12.44]But most of us have no idea what's going on here.
[63:16.04]Buy a tire pump at... Okay.
[63:19.94]Buy a tire pump at Cali Gas in town.
[63:27.01]Build the sugar shack.
[63:28.17]Let's go ahead and just do this part first.
[63:33.17]I need a tire pump at Cali Gas in town.
[63:37.92]Does this car drive now?
[63:40.10]Or do I have to take the truck?
[63:50.56]This has got no gas, so never mind.
[63:55.32]Don't take the chainsaw.
[63:56.36]Put it in the shed.
[63:59.24]Why is he so mean today?
[64:00.28]I'm not being mean.
[64:05.82]I am handling a toxic community.
[64:14.21]Take the gas can?
[64:14.99]Good call.
[64:21.71]I'm kidding.
[64:22.47]You guys are fine.
[64:23.45]Relax.
[64:30.46]Somebody said damn right.
[64:31.64]Get out of here.
[64:32.24]Relax.
[64:33.66]Okay.
[64:36.50]So where I am right now, I need to go to the gas station.
[64:39.05]So going to the gas station, don't go that way.
[64:41.39]It's just go to the main road, which is that way.
[64:43.73]Over there.
[64:45.34]I have plenty of gas.
[64:46.24]I got my gas tank.
[64:47.16]I've got plenty of money.
[64:48.50]I'm going to eat and drink something.
[64:49.82]That was a hard day's work on the car.
[64:51.91]I'm going to drink this coffee.
[64:58.83]I'm going to spit into the toilet and miss and hit the ground and not clean it up.
[65:06.54]We're going to go with our gray shirt today.
[65:12.69]Let me make sure I'm fully... Okay, I'm good.
[65:15.72]Alright.
[65:16.04]Good to go.
[65:31.27]See?
[65:32.75]We moved.
[65:41.81]Remember this road.
[65:42.83]Burn it into your memory right now.
[65:44.19]This is loud, isn't it?
[65:46.43]Day 9 of Jerma not reading my messages.
[65:48.27]I just read it.
[65:48.77]Sorry, you're going to have to reset it.
[66:00.72]Okay, so this is now the main road.
[66:02.96]So this is a left...
[66:15.51]By the way, that's not a very long counter.
[66:27.69]That's not that long.
[66:30.50]Do you understand?
[66:31.18]I said I was going to play Paper Mario like three years ago, and somebody's been waiting for Paper Mario every day.
[66:36.92]Do you understand?
[66:38.86]It's...
[66:44.86]There are people that were waiting like two years for me to play Shito.
[66:50.40]Which understandable, I said I was gonna play Shito like a year and a half ago and I never did.
[67:01.65]What the fuck?
[67:11.31]I'm waiting for Paper Mario.
[67:14.09]I don't think it's ever going to happen.
[67:15.11]I just don't think so.
[67:18.74]We're fine.
[67:19.92]I'm fine.
[67:20.24]I'm fine.
[67:20.48]Just don't freak out.
[67:21.20]Just let it.
[67:21.58]Put a four wheel.
[67:30.98]Where the fuck is the road?
[67:43.80]You literally own the Switch Online, just play it.
[67:45.75]Okay.
[67:50.01]Fuck.
[67:58.45]I lost my gas can.
[68:09.92]Was anything else in the back of the car?
[68:18.75]Dude, where is the gas can?
[68:26.11]Oh my god.
[68:27.59]Is it the other way?
[68:29.23]No, I took the chainsaw.
[68:30.27]We're good.
[68:33.17]Other way.
[68:33.71]Oh my fucking god.
[68:34.81]Disrespect me again.
[68:35.83]I don't know why I'm on that today.
[68:40.88]Where is it?
[68:52.26]It's not... There it is.
[68:56.72]I got it!
[68:59.06]And right now, that person right now is going like... And I go over, I go... And you can see them through the windshield like... And then they turn to the person in the passenger side and they're like, fucking idiot.
[69:22.61]Piece of fucking shit.
[69:23.65]What a dumb fuck that guy is.
[69:25.35]Fuck that guy.
[69:30.47]And then as they're pulling away, it's like, yeah, good job, man.
[69:34.53]And then like... Oh.
[69:46.79]And then I go on, like, a 25-minute rant about, like, society and, like, humanity.
[69:52.15]The person right here.
[69:57.90]Wrong way?
[70:00.72]It's the right way.
[70:15.47]Is it the right way?
[70:16.01]It's...
[70:27.04]Um, am I?
[70:27.92]I'm going the right way, right?
[70:36.62]I don't know.
[70:37.18]Oh, shit.
[70:37.58]I'm sorry.
[70:40.02]Hey, I go down.
[70:41.36]I grab my phone.
[70:42.14]Oh, my phone.
[70:43.93]Hey.
[70:56.96]I think, no, this is the right way.
[70:58.02]Isn't the church over there?
[71:03.50]I actually think I might have turned around.
[71:04.88]I don't know.
[71:05.86]No, it's not.
[71:06.63]Did I drive by this?
[71:09.31]How do I hit?
[71:27.19]No, please.
[71:28.21]No, please.
[71:30.59]I was going the wrong way.
[71:31.51]The gas.
[71:47.00]It's in the trunk.
[71:47.86]It's right there.
[71:49.06]Stop distracting me.
[71:50.82]Oh, my God.
[71:51.72]I can't fucking play this.
[72:10.56]Did you lose the gas can?
[72:13.86]I can't fucking play this game.
[72:23.46]If the game does not have a map indicator I can't play it.
[72:26.78]I have to be honest with you.
[72:28.70]If I can't see a blip on the map right now I can't play the game.
[72:35.62]It's not possible.
[72:43.82]There it is.
[72:44.20]I got it.
[72:46.34]What is in the cab?
[72:47.16]Yeah, there's no map indicator.
[72:51.62]I can't play the game.
[72:53.98]Because I'll get distracted and look over here and like look at you while I'm still holding W, turn like this, and then look back this way.
[73:02.58]And I think I'm on the same road that I was when I looked over at you.
[73:06.08]So it's not happening.
[73:16.43]You should just do Paper Mario.
[73:21.83]You wouldn't survive 23 hours in the wilderness.
[73:24.39]Yes, I would, because I would just eat fucking bugs and dirt, and I'd be fine.
[73:28.32]You don't need a map to eat bugs on the ground.
[73:32.50]Excuse me.
[73:33.42]I would be just fine.
[73:41.99]Dude, you would never survive in the wilderness 24 hours.
[73:44.37]I would eat bugs on the ground, and I would live.
[73:47.39]Okay.
[73:48.09]Next question, please.
[73:51.35]I don't need a map to figure out how to eat fucking, like, stuff on the grubs on the ground.
[73:57.72]Sorry about that.
[74:00.66]I wish there was a horn.
[74:01.78]Oh.
[74:03.47]Yep.
[74:17.50]Still plenty of gas.
[74:26.42]This is not even remotely where the town is, though, by the way.
[74:29.08]Like, do I even have a compass?
[74:33.08]I don't even know.
[74:33.56]How do I get to the fucking town?
[74:35.87]The gas station's gonna close.
[74:37.17]Hurry up.
[74:43.45]This person thinks I'm probably fucking chasing them.
[75:08.72]I'm driving in a giant circle.
[75:10.33]I don't think this is how you get to the fucking town.
[75:22.68]I've been... Oh my fucking god.
[75:29.04]I've been driving around in a circle to bottom left.
[75:38.14]Okay, so... Where the fuck even am I?
[75:44.48]There's three of those silo places.
[75:46.98]Am I driving straight now?
[75:52.65]Just keep going straight.
[75:59.85]You actually need waypoints.
[76:05.23]I'm sorry, there's one road to get to the town, and there's no compass, and there's no... The map is just like a map that I... It's like Elden Ring.
[76:13.50]It's like the Elden Ring map, and to get to Lunaria, I have to... Whatever.
[76:20.40]North, south, east, west, they've had that since the fucking Stone Age.
[76:23.43]Where is it?
[76:35.34]Here we go.
[76:39.18]Take a right?
[76:44.47]What the fuck?
[76:48.07]I just wish I had a compass.
[76:54.28]Dude, cavemen were looking at the sun like burning their eyes and going like, that way.
[77:09.08]You need to use the sun?
[77:10.26]Okay.
[77:21.03]Oh, here we go.
[77:22.09]Hey, I found it.
[77:34.77]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[77:36.01]I need to go to the store.
[77:37.67]The store was over here.
[77:40.53]I remember the school.
[78:00.45]Hey!
[78:09.52]Okay, what did I need to do?
[78:10.42]I need to buy something from here.
[78:12.64]What did I need to buy?
[78:13.92]It was something from here.
[78:14.66]Don't, don't close yet.
[78:20.51]It was some kind of a torque thing, right?
[78:24.49]Tire pump.
[78:26.69]Thank you.
[78:53.85]What?
[78:56.85]Why not?
[78:57.19]I don't wanna buy super.
[79:26.12]How do I fill the tank?
[79:27.14]Take the cap off?
[79:28.10]How?
[79:28.32]I need the wrench.
[79:50.90]Uh, they're gonna close in fucking one second.
[79:52.96]Just get gas in the car.
[80:20.79]Okay, take this off.
[80:38.47]I got the tire pump, at least.
[80:39.85]Okay.
[80:41.81]But how do you fill the gap?
[80:44.03]Do I have to actually go in here and say, can I fill this?
[80:46.87]They're not closed yet.
[80:51.29]Do I have to, like... How do I... I wanted to fill this.
[81:01.35]Open the cap?
[81:04.35]There's some special fucking... Like, sit around and do a seance to get the cap to open.
[81:09.99]Steal the gas?
[81:10.92]I can't.
[81:20.00]And guys, where the...

[82:20.82]I'm out of gas.
[82:37.80]Yeah, I know, take the knowledge, but I thought I could just go over there and, like, press E. It says, like, E to you.
[82:42.44]I don't, I don't, well, I'm trying, I... I don't know how to, like, unscrew the cap to do, I... I come over to this fucking thing and I'm pressing E. First of all, it says, sorry, don't use that, uh, that, like, pleb gas.

[84:09.59]I don't know what road I'm even on.
[84:11.73]I'm like in the town up here somewhere.
[84:17.48]Okay, is the church on the map?

[85:35.38]I think I'm going the right way.
[85:36.14]Because now... Wait.
[85:40.18]Is it that road right there?
[85:41.28]Because this is now... I have no idea.

[93:17.70]This one right here.
[93:19.26]Drive towards that mountain and have that mountain be on your left.
[93:21.98]You're on the right spot.
[93:25.28]The church needs to be on my right.
[93:28.26]Going out, mountain right there.

[94:39.78]We can now play the game now.
[94:40.88]I apologize to everybody that came here and said, I'm fucking leaving this stream.
[94:43.68]This guy sucks.
[94:45.00]If you came back to check, you probably didn't, but I'm now playing the game.
[94:51.11]Now.
[94:53.34]Question is, from the church.
[94:56.38]Who's that?
[94:56.68]It's not going anywhere.
[95:08.75]What's up?
[95:09.11]Some cars make so much noise.
[95:10.61]Ew.
[95:12.41]Can you find something for me, please?
[95:15.60]I take a walk this afternoon.
[95:16.72]I can look for your object.
[95:20.46]I didn't lose anything, did I?
[95:28.87]You only have $80?
[95:29.47]That's interesting.
[95:34.87]Alright, I gotta hurry up before the sun goes down.
[95:36.99]Because I'm not restarting a third time.
[95:40.83]That would be an embarrassment.
[95:52.48]I'm not gonna run somebody over for fun.
[95:55.36]Okay, the gas station is now...
[95:58.94]Down here.
[95:59.60]So it's just straight to the gas station.
[96:03.32]Don't look at the snack bullshit.
[96:04.72]Don't go over there.
[96:06.35]Right here.
[96:07.09]It's just straight.
[96:11.45]No, it's not.
[96:32.26]It's a left at the Snack Shack.
[96:34.04]We go straight and then it's a left at the end of the Snack Shack road.
[96:39.49]He's so mad.
[96:44.55]I am.
[96:47.27]I am.
[96:47.49]I'm trying to calm down.
[96:48.63]I really am.
[96:49.37]I'm trying to relax, but I'm so fucking heated.
[96:52.15]Okay, where's the gas station?
[97:13.13]The school bus was there, and then... It's that snack shack, but the gas station's not on here.
[97:20.28]What do you mean Ludwig's coming?
[97:21.92]What do you mean?
[97:22.70]Call Ludwig for directions.
[97:24.74]What do you mean?
[97:25.22]What's Ludwig coming?
[97:27.70]I got it!
[97:35.48]Give me fucking gas!
[97:37.52]Stop!
[97:38.08]Stop the car.
[97:38.93]Stop the car.
[98:37.80]So what do I do now?
[99:22.94]Okay, please, screw this back on!
[99:30.05]It took him two hours to do this.
[99:32.45]Dude, give me a little bit of a slack here, okay?
[99:35.25]This is confusing.
[99:36.41]Okay, I have gas.
[99:42.18]I want more gas in this car.
[99:47.40]Give me this.
[99:48.34]Open that up.
[99:49.54]I want more gas.
[99:57.44]Get out of the fucking car.
[100:04.02]Is this actually working?
[100:04.88]Turn the car off.

[100:18.02]How much is the bike pump?
[100:31.25]Alright, okay.
[100:31.97]I only have six dollars left.
[100:33.77]Is that bad?

[101:30.56]Save the game.
[101:32.26]Uh, how?

[102:01.79]Okay.
[102:03.51]Mountain Peak.
[102:07.05]It's on our left.
[102:09.54]So now we just drive on this road.
[102:10.84]We go through the Moses Pass.
[102:14.32]Which is right here.
[102:22.32]No, no, not quite.
[102:30.40]So now we are at this intersection.
[102:37.01]We stay to the right.
[102:41.89]Wait.
[102:42.53]No, we don't.
[102:43.37]We go... Yes, we stay right.
[102:46.68]Yes, we do.
[102:48.18]Stay to the... Stop lying to me.
[102:50.66]Because I'm at the- we stay right, and then I drive on this road forever.
[102:53.88]Wait.
[102:54.70]Yep.
[102:55.42]And then we're gone.
[102:56.54]Done.

[102:57.64]Done.
[102:57.92]We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[103:01.46]Don't... I'm not going to let you guys gaslight the fuck out of me right now.
[103:05.03]Not when I'm this upset.

[103:18.49]Finally.
[103:18.81]Got it.
[103:19.39]Everything's fine, right?
[103:30.37]Yeah.
[103:38.23]This is worse than the unlocked stream.
[103:41.53]it's not you're out of your mind you've gone you've gone hollow if you think that ah thank god okay let's go let's go let's go where's the gas tank
[104:13.19]Oh my god, finally!
[104:14.67]Where's the gas tank?
[104:26.64]Let's do it.
[104:27.31]Oh my god, I finally can drive the car.
[104:28.93]Is this working?
[104:48.92]I'm not fucking doing that till I'm certain that's happening.
[104:52.45]Fuck.
[104:53.07]Okay, I know it's on.
[104:55.47]Yeah, I'm not doing that till I'm 100% certain.
[104:57.23]Where'd the gas go?
[105:06.72]I'm not certain that that's actually working, so I'm just gonna sit this down.
[105:14.93]Okay.
[105:15.59]I don't know if that's working or not, so I'm afraid to do that until I'm certain.
[105:18.09]So let's do it.
[105:18.91]Let's fix the goddamn car.
[105:33.52]Good.
[105:33.90]Okay.

[105:45.68]It really is.
[105:46.06]I wish I could pick up more than one thing at a time, though.
[105:57.23]Every screw is going over here.
[105:59.29]This is worse than the unlocked stream.
[106:01.95]No, it's not.
[106:02.67]And you know why it's not?
[106:03.53]Because you couldn't even read the text in the unlocked stream.
[106:08.04]It was not even visible.
[106:09.30]You couldn't read it.
[106:10.34]And that was the whole stream, was you being able to read the text on the cards.
[106:16.45]There's no way this is worse.
[106:18.33]Not a chance.
[106:19.97]Not a chance in fucking hell.
[106:23.61]Alright, let's go.
[106:24.10]Alright, bingo.

[125:13.74]Okay.
[125:25.02]Okay.
[125:27.22]You can sell firewood here.

[125:33.69]Alright, so now... Can I drive that other car?
[125:41.19]If I put gas in that car, can I drive it now?
[125:48.96]The fuck?

[125:56.05]How do I get firewood?
[126:02.51]Uh...
[126:06.12]Do I have to buy, like, an axe?
[126:07.82]Chainsaw?
[126:11.01]Can I cut down any tree?
[126:12.17]Or do I have to cut down specific ones?
[126:18.53]Just hit a tree with your truck.
[126:23.60]Okay.
[126:26.22]I'm gonna go get the chainsaw.
[126:28.18]I need money.
[126:28.78]I don't have any.
[126:29.30]I have zero dollars, man.
[126:44.86]Or am I on gas on this car?
[126:46.00]I'm okay.
[126:52.78]So I'm gonna load this truck up with a shitload of firewood.
[126:55.16]That sounds good.
[127:04.91]The parking brake is not on.
[127:06.35]Alright, I gotta stop looking at the chatroom when I'm driving a vehicle.
[127:09.56]That would be fucking swell.
[127:15.21]Oh my god, don't even fucking tell me.
[127:20.54]We're good.
[127:36.12]Okay.
[127:44.22]Chainsaw, please.
[127:46.64]Now, does this thing have gas too?
[127:52.64]Like, does this thing have gas?
[127:56.32]Or is it just going to work?
[128:01.34]I can't cut this.
[128:03.24]Okay, well, what about over here?
[128:09.73]Okay.

[128:48.89]Cut it until it's- oh, okay, alright, alright, let's go.
[129:09.68]How much do you get per, uh, per thing of wood?
[129:13.99]I need to use the log splitter.
[129:15.67]Well, I'm going to load the truck up, and then I'll take it from here.
[129:19.60]Right?
[129:21.48]I'm assuming the green circle is how you turn it into firewood, right?
[129:26.44]Nobody here knows.
[129:27.77]It's behind the house?
[129:45.07]I don't think so.
[129:49.75]Let me just check something real quick.
[129:51.89]No, okay, I can't cut it anymore.
[129:55.21]It's the red thing?
[129:56.21]Guys, this is like a trailer.
[130:04.78]This is a trailer.
[130:06.54]What are you talking about?
[130:11.68]Am I high?
[130:13.22]Are you high?
[130:15.47]This is not a log splitter.
[130:17.17]If this is a coupler for you, attach it to the back of a truck.
[130:23.55]It's not... I think... What are you... Oh my goodness.
[130:34.25]It's not a woodcutter.
[130:35.77]This is the thing you attach a trailer to a truck.
[130:41.73]That's not a woodcutter.
[130:44.78]What do you mean look at it?
[130:45.90]I'm not looking at it.
[130:48.88]Bro.
[130:50.22]Fellas.
[130:51.04]Ladies and gentlemen.
[130:52.20]That is not a woodcutter.
[130:58.15]This is not a woodcutter.
[131:02.97]It is.
[131:03.31]Yeah, it isn't.
[131:07.35]Look, alright, I'm not, I'm not, I don't need to further this anymore.
[131:10.22]You guys are losing your minds.
[131:12.76]You guys are losing your fucking minds.
[131:15.26]It's not a log splitter.
[131:16.74]What the f- What is happening in this chatroom?
[131:20.44]This is a trailer.
[131:22.57]What is happening here?
[131:25.05]No, you guys are fucked up.
[131:26.41]I'm leaving.
[131:45.01]Look up a Google image of a log splitter.
[131:47.70]I'm fucking freaking out right now.
[131:50.18]Log splitter.
[132:03.52]Huh?
[132:05.28]This is a trailer.
[132:07.01]This is... I don't know.
[132:09.37]Huh?
[132:10.11]You gotta be kidding me, man.
[132:11.93]No, it's not.
[132:12.75]This is not.
[132:13.73]I tried to use it.
[132:20.79]What?
[132:22.25]You can't be serious, man.
[132:26.05]No, I thought it was people just fucking with me and just making up random shit.
[132:29.52]This is a log splitter.
[132:48.05]I thought this was something you attach to the back of a truck.
[132:51.27]No way.
[132:57.18]No way.
[133:02.52]I thought every... Wow.
[133:08.54]I can't believe it.
[133:12.34]I can't believe it.
[133:13.16]How do you turn it on then?
[133:20.75]It does both?
[133:25.51]I've never seen one of these in my entire life.
[133:27.57]Is there enough fuel in it?
[133:36.36]City boy.
[133:38.22]I'm sorry, but I don't know how many of us here have never seen a wood splitting machine in their entire life.
[133:47.51]I haven't.
[134:02.15]Come on, dude.
[134:07.25]Apologize.
[134:07.83]No.
[134:19.96]Is he high?
[134:20.72]I'm sitting there freaking out about this.
[134:23.64]How do I turn this on?
[134:28.60]Do you see how soft my hands are?
[134:31.17]Look at how soft they are.
[134:51.49]I've never seen this before in my whole life.
[134:54.65]I always just, it's always the guy that's, okay.
[134:58.51]It's always, anytime I think of wood cutting or log cutting, it's this jacked guy with like huge pecs and a fucking like just abs.
[135:08.41]And he's wicked sweating.
[135:09.85]And he's like smashing through wicked hard with an axe.
[135:12.71]That's, I've never seen somebody do it with a machine.
[135:15.92]Ever.
[135:22.54]It's always a jacked guy with no shirt on.
[135:25.40]I've never seen a machine.
[135:45.27]That's so funny.
[135:47.05]That's actually really funny.
[135:49.09]I can't believe it.
[135:50.85]Okay, turn this off.
[135:51.51]Don't waste gas.
[135:53.24]How much can I put in the truck?
[135:54.14]Probably a lot, right?
[136:01.25]Apology.
[136:01.91]Okay.
[136:03.33]I'm sorry that I told you guys that you were stupid because I thought that the trailer that you attached to the back of the truck was apparently like a piston-operated, electronic gas-operated log-cutting machine.
[136:19.97]I'm sorry that...
[136:47.96]Come on, you guys have been messing with me all day, though.
[136:50.12]How am I supposed to know when you guys are not?
[136:55.91]Alright, give me... I need to make a ton of money.
[136:59.89]He's a city slicker.
[137:03.45]Guys, people are doing... Like, I'm the kind of person that... Oh, hey, yeah, we're gonna go out back and we're gonna build a fucking shed.
[137:16.05]I'm like, okay, does anybody need their taxes done?
[137:17.79]Like, I can, I'll help you do that.
[137:22.17]I can, you know, I can help with something else.
[137:27.93]I'm not, I'm not the kind of person that knows what this is.
[137:31.44]Like, oh, do you want, I can actually, like, you want me to run, what do you need?
[137:36.52]You need oil?
[137:38.38]And you need, um, you need, like, this, like, kind of, like, special kind of, like, grease or something that I can go get?
[137:42.98]Or you need, like, I'll run, I'll run Home Depot.
[137:45.76]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[137:46.60]I'll be back in like 10 minutes.
[137:49.76]Anybody need coffee or anything?
[137:51.42]That's me.
[137:51.89]I'm that kind of person.
[137:52.63]I'm that guy.
[137:59.35]I gotta pull the truck down.
[138:06.89]Yeah, I'm that guy.
[138:14.88]You don't want me to cut the wood.
[138:16.44]You really don't.
[138:17.32]I'm telling you right now.
[138:18.10]I promise you.
[138:18.66]I... I don't even know how it would happen.
[138:23.58]I would go to cut the wood.
[138:26.56]And, like, the axe would come out of my hand.
[138:29.38]And, like, go flying.
[138:30.74]Like, the handle would break off.
[138:32.48]Somehow.
[138:32.82]Like a fucking... Like a comic... Like, cartoon style.
[138:36.71]I don't know how it would happen, but it would.
[138:59.57]Put the wood in the meat grinder.
[139:03.91]You were a gym bro.
[139:06.77]Like 10 years ago, and I wouldn't have cut wood back then either.
[139:10.69]I still would have been the guy that goes and gets the coffee.
[139:13.83]Just because I was in the gym does not mean I would be comfortable swinging an axe or touching heavy machinery.
[139:19.41]That doesn't change.
[139:24.33]I would go like to pour you coffee, you know, and it'd be like this.
[139:26.45]It'd be kind of hard.
[139:28.66]You know what I mean?
[139:29.10]But I'd still do it.
[139:48.05]Please, don't even... Give me a break.
[140:01.46]Did you ever skip leg day?
[140:02.60]I never did legs once.
[140:04.04]That's a lie.
[140:04.46]I'm kidding.
[140:04.86]Don't fucking be an idiot.
[140:10.58]Goddamn parking brake is gonna make me lose my mind.
[140:12.85]Okay.
[140:24.11]I am doing this, I know this is people going, like, oh, snooze fest, I'm snoozing.
[140:27.69]I can't, wake me up when he's doing something.
[140:30.43]I'm trying to, like, I need money.
[140:34.76]I'm going to fill this car with this shit.
[140:36.84]It's going to be to the brim.
[140:38.04]And I'm going to make, like, $150.
[140:38.80]At least.
[140:52.26]Three trees is enough.
[140:53.62]We'll see.
[140:54.04]Maybe one more tree.
[140:55.37]I promise that's it.
[141:02.61]I can't.
[141:04.77]That was visible, audible, and mental shock that this was actually a real thing.
[141:14.21]Please be... Okay, everybody here be honest with me, though.
[141:16.23]Be honest with me.
[141:17.43]Did you actually know what this was?
[141:20.40]Like, how many of you knew what this, this, this was actually that, what that is?
[141:32.06]I've been to Home Depot.
[141:34.98]I've been to Home Depot a shitload of times, too, and I've never gone to the woodcutting machines and gone and, wow, that's interesting.
[141:40.12]How does that work?
[141:41.82]No.
[141:41.98]No.
[141:42.73]I go to Home Depot and I walk around in a circle looking for a light bulb and I don't know where the fuck they are until I find the one person that points me to the other end of the entire, like, three mile long store that's like, oh, the light bulbs are in aisle 400.
[141:55.08]And then I go to aisle 400 and then I leave.
[141:56.92]Alright, last one.
[142:04.80]One more and that's it.
[142:06.25]I promise.
[142:06.65]This is it.
[142:14.47]Okay, we're good.
[142:20.47]This is not efficient, but it's okay.
[142:21.43]What about Ikea?
[142:36.53]Well, the great thing about Ikea is Ikea makes it so you cannot screw it up.
[142:42.88]You have to walk through the whole store, and the store is like, hey, by the way, just to let you know, you're walking through this part of, like, Disney World.
[142:50.12]You have to walk through everything in Ikea.
[142:52.48]And there are, like, Dark Souls shortcuts in Ikea, if you feel like skipping to something else, but you don't have to do that.
[142:59.45]Like, I know that I'm just going to eventually walk into the kitchen appliance section in Ikea.
[143:05.73]I'm just eventually going to, it's going to happen eventually.
[143:18.31]I love that place, by the way.
[143:31.34]Oh, dude.
[143:31.76]Oh, the meatballs, right?
[143:42.49]Alright, that's enough.
[143:48.04]They're actually really good.
[143:49.08]And I know everyone's like bat-chesting right now, but they're actually really good.
[143:52.56]Pretty much all the food from there is really good.
[143:55.36]They have like salmons, they have sauces, they have all kinds of meatball.
[143:58.70]It's cool.
[143:59.18]It's really cool.
[144:00.40]It's a nice place.
[144:03.62]It's fine.
[144:04.14]It's good stuff.
[144:19.45]I love Ikea meatballs, bad chest.
[144:24.83]Yeah.
[144:26.08]And then when you go to Ikea and you eat them, and then you fucking literally delete all of your, like, chat logs.
[144:32.22]I don't even want to know I said that.
[144:46.51]They're not bad.
[144:47.01]They're not bad.
[144:58.14]Alright, this is a lot.
[144:59.02]Okay.
[145:01.58]I understand now when people say, okay, I'll tell you right now, if I drive on the road and I flip this car over and it's ruined and this was like the last half an hour was a waste of time, I'm going to do everything in my power to make that not possible.
[145:17.61]Because this is probably like a few hundred bucks worth of wood.
[145:26.66]Put a tarp over it?
[145:27.76]Can you do that?
[145:28.25]Turn this off.
[145:31.03]Waste of gas.
[145:32.23]Stop wasting gas.
[145:37.15]That chest.
[145:48.73]Almost there.
[145:49.61]Everybody, hold on.
[145:50.29]You can wake up in a minute.
[145:55.69]You know what's really ridiculous?
[145:59.08]I'm so glad that I was not on a call with somebody.
[146:01.06]I would have bet money that this was not a woodcutter.
[146:13.63]If I was in a call with anybody and they were like, dude, that's a woodcutter.
[146:16.90]And they were saying, like, Pepe laugh.
[146:19.62]And you guys were saying Pepe laugh and shit.
[146:22.28]I would have been like, fine, put a thousand bucks up.
[146:25.32]And I would have lost.
[146:29.69]I need to eat something.
[146:36.57]Save the game.
[146:37.21]Good call.
[146:46.31]That's a very good call.
[146:57.40]Is the rest of the stream going to be about, can you recognize a woodcutter?
[147:01.48]Nah, we'll move on probably pretty shortly here.
[147:06.62]Probably like now.
[147:13.74]I'll give you $10,000 to flip the truck.
[147:17.71]No.
[147:20.81]No.
[147:22.54]I'm serious.
[147:32.72]No.
[147:33.04]There are 15,500 people here.
[147:35.37]And that would like annoy and like irritate 15,000 people.
[147:40.49]So essentially what that would be would be I would be getting a dollar like per person to like irritate the fuck out of everybody.
[147:46.71]And I don't, I don't, I kind of don't want to do that.
[147:49.27]Alright, well, this is fine.
[148:03.95]I gotta sleep.
[148:05.83]I need to eat something.
[148:12.05]I don't think I have any food.
[148:14.33]Oh, I have this.
[148:14.95]Yeah!
[148:16.09]We're good.
[148:18.55]Alright, let's go sleep.
[148:21.43]Should I turn the power off and go to bed?
[148:22.65]Maybe you should... Whatever.
[148:44.50]I'll give you $1,000 per... No one's giving me $1,000.
[148:49.36]No one's... Okay, don't even joke.
[148:58.41]What time is it?
[148:59.55]Is it really 1am?
[149:01.57]What is the sleep schedule I'm on?
[149:03.29]Fuck.
[149:04.37]Well, I'm cutting another... Okay, I'm cutting another tree down then.
[149:09.10]Yeah.
[149:09.64]Okay, I'm gonna cut another tree down.
[149:13.60]Because it won't fit.
[149:17.54]Actually, it really might not.
[149:18.54]You're right.
[149:21.04]Let me spread this out because this will be a disaster.
[149:31.67]I'm going to go very slow.
[149:32.91]I'm going to bring the chainsaw, too.
[149:38.24]There might be stuff at his property I can cut down.
[149:46.36]It's not going to be a disaster.
[149:47.14]It'll be fine.
[149:48.10]Alright.
[149:52.21]Let's bring the chainsaw.
[149:54.17]That's in the car.
[149:57.47]I'm not trying to cut this.
[150:05.46]Go back to bed.
[150:19.69]I've watched this video on Fail Army a hundred times.
[150:24.34]What does that mean?
[150:33.26]Alright, this is empty, so I have to fill that back up if I have any... Alright, here's the plan.
[150:42.72]Gonna go make a bunch of money.
[150:43.58]Let's go.
[150:45.76]How am I on gas?
[150:51.64]I could use some.
[150:57.24]Hill army?
[151:06.43]I saw the stream five days ago.
[151:08.01]That's weird.
[151:20.68]Can I see how much is in there?
[151:28.51]Empty.
[151:28.97]Okay.
[151:29.33]Alright.
[151:30.01]I got a full tank of gas.
[151:36.39]Okay, we're good.
[151:37.99]Full tank of gas.
[151:39.59]Bring the gas can, because after I do this, I'm going to town to get more gas.
[151:45.42]The car is almost ready.
[151:48.04]I can just need to fill it with gas, and I can drive it.
[151:52.42]do not flip the car under any circumstance do not flip the car under any circumstance don't do it it's not funny it's not a joke it would be annoying because you just wasted like 35 straight minutes cutting wood Jeremy I know you think you're quite the comedian but this is not the time to do that let's go
[152:21.84]And a lot of people are gonna think that that was on purpose, but it was not.
[152:25.06]And... I... You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[152:29.60]I'm gonna quit the game.
[152:31.27]Honest to God, that... You... Don't even tell me that, like, this is... That's un-fucking-believable.
[152:38.25]And it looks so stupid.
[152:40.51]It's so stupid because it looks like I fucking meant to do that.
[152:45.63]I'm fine.
[152:46.19]It's fine.
[152:46.79]I can just reverse.
[152:50.51]That looks so shit and so planned.
[152:55.59]That looked so fucking fake and it's annoying that it did.
[153:13.46]I can't fucking believe it, man.
[153:20.38]I can't believe it.
[153:21.58]I can't.
[153:22.70]I cannot believe it.
[153:23.64]Scripted fucking bullshit.
[153:29.60]I can't believe how fucking fake that looked.
[153:32.36]In fact, I... I can't.
[153:51.80]I really thought that this did not drop off like this.
[153:54.68]I thought it was just here and that I could just go left.
[153:57.19]Because remember, I was up in the truck like this, and I'm driving this way, and it's like, take the left.
[154:02.55]I didn't think there was a divot right there, and it doesn't matter what I say.
[154:06.18]I'm like a try-hard funny Andy that, like, thought that was funny, and there's nothing I can do about that.
[154:11.18]Like,
[154:18.11]Use the lever?
[154:19.29]Dude, come on.
[154:21.61]I, my life is a f- I can't.
[154:30.06]So scripted and so just fake.
[154:35.86]He's doing the thing.
[154:36.64]Look at, he's like talking about like, oh, don't mess it up, Jeremy.
[154:39.72]Oh, oops, oopsie.
[154:40.98]Oh, I fell down, guys.
[154:44.52]Oh, what happened?
[154:46.16]I'm so mad right now.
[154:47.08]You have no idea.
[154:53.19]Load the save.
[154:56.21]Quiet.
[154:57.65]Not you, me.
[155:05.70]Just put it like under here.
[155:06.60]Would that work?
[155:27.88]I don't think that's doing anything.
[155:38.69]I'm just gonna reload the save.
[155:41.45]Far away.
[156:12.09]Call it back?
[156:39.70]What if I just used it?
[156:40.72]I can't use it again?
[156:50.13]Fuck.
[156:50.43]Guys, I'm fucked, I think.
[156:55.33]Put it in neutral.
[156:56.04]How do I do neutral?
[157:07.40]Alright, alright, alright.
[157:34.03]I swear to god this wasn't on purpose, I promise.
[157:36.35]Can I pull it like from here?
[157:40.49]Here it goes.
[158:00.72]It's fucked.
[158:02.53]Back side?
[158:16.19]Here it goes.
[158:18.31]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[158:19.73]I can't believe it.
[158:20.43]Can I get out now?
[158:37.60]I might be able to get out now.
[159:06.86]I have to reload the save.
[159:08.60]Hold the front right.
[159:13.59]Front right side.
[159:14.37]Fuck.
[159:19.99]No, it's wedged in here.
[159:21.29]This shit ain't going anywhere, guys.
[159:28.58]It's like just stuck here forever.
[159:51.58]Yeah, this is copium.
[159:52.25]It really is.
[159:54.09]Ram it with the ATV.
[159:55.13]Now, this is absolute copium.
[159:56.86]And I... This is copium.
[160:22.08]It's copium.
[160:22.50]I need to reload the save.
[160:34.08]Which is... It's this one here, right?
[160:35.12]Head up.
[161:00.36]Turn off- Turn this off.
[161:09.15]Turn everything off.
[161:09.73]Go to bed.
[161:16.34]I'm not gonna get stuck again.
[161:17.38]I- I will- This is the worst stream ever.
[161:32.42]That sucks so bad that, like, I really did not mean to do that.
[161:37.32]It's like 1 o'clock in the morning.
[161:38.60]Just sleep until... It's 6 a.m.
[161:54.70]This was my first stream.
[162:04.09]Fuck, I'm done, I'm out.
[162:10.68]Get in the fucking car.
[162:12.80]Get the fuck in the car.
[162:14.86]Turn the fucking car on.
[162:18.79]Put it in one.
[162:19.59]And this is what I saw before.
[162:24.75]That looks like a level fucking plane.
[162:44.98]What about the gas can?
[163:12.73]Let's go.
[163:43.83]Check that rear view.
[163:46.00]No, no chainsaw.
[163:46.88]No, no, no, no, no.
[163:47.48]No, I don't have time for that right now.
[163:58.40]It's a war stream.
[163:59.46]Fuck.
[164:00.60]No, it can't be.
[164:03.08]No, I'll fix it.
[164:04.56]I'll fix it.
[164:05.06]It can't be.
[164:11.10]It can't be.
[164:11.76]I'll fix it.
[164:16.06]Don't go down that way.
[164:19.78]I'll fix it.
[164:20.28]I'll fix it.
[164:34.79]Let's go.
[164:39.68]I get five bucks for every log.
[164:41.88]I'm going to be a fucking millionaire at the end of this.
[164:51.77]Pull it closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer.
[165:05.97]Oh my god, thank goodness.
[165:25.48]Just drive over it?
[165:26.34]Does that work?
[165:31.26]I'm not, no.
[165:32.12]No, no, no.
[165:32.74]I'm not fucking around.
[165:58.55]Does work.
[165:58.95]Alright.
[165:59.19]I thought you were lying.
[166:08.55]I have 265 bucks.
[166:13.50]Alright.
[166:14.04]We're in business now.
[166:15.26]Let's fucking go.
[166:19.08]Alright.
[166:19.62]Plan.
[166:20.06]Here comes a plan.
[166:20.82]We're gonna get the plan going.
[166:24.44]Plan.
[166:24.66]Plan.
[166:28.71]Load up the car with gas.
[166:31.29]You're going to come out of the birth canal.
[166:33.69]I'm not coming out of the birth canal.
[166:43.21]Full tank of gas.
[166:49.10]Let's go.
[166:49.70]I got 300 bucks.
[166:50.64]I'm ready to do it.
[166:51.28]Let's go.
[166:51.76]Stream just started.
[166:52.66]You just got here.
[167:02.49]Okay, this shit's empty.
[167:03.39]I need to fill that back up.
[167:05.23]I've got a full tank of gas.
[167:08.45]Almost 300 bucks.
[167:10.43]I can go into town.
[167:12.19]Let's take a look here.
[167:15.13]If I keep going just to the left.
[167:17.86]Straight.
[167:18.42]Go through the Moses Tunnel.
[167:23.48]We're going back into town.
[167:24.22]This is the worst stream ever.
[167:29.44]It's not the worst.
[167:30.22]No, it's not.
[167:30.84]I refuse to believe it.
[167:33.15]Nope.
[167:34.33]Sorry.
[167:37.65]Nope.
[167:50.72]Okay, here we go.
[167:52.66]Stay left.
[168:00.60]Bang a left here.
[168:02.57]We're gonna go buy some equipment for that car.
[168:11.91]It can't possibly be the worst stream.
[168:13.23]He made a silly... Cat's being mean.
[168:23.24]It's okay.
[168:25.30]We don't have to listen to them.
[168:27.52]You and me, we get it.
[168:41.54]I can... Is that another potato?
[168:46.00]No, I do have to... I'm going to buy some snacks, I think.
[168:50.48]Because I'm going to run out of food soon here.
[168:56.13]Snack shack was down here, right?
[169:11.51]Isn't the snack shack over here?
[169:27.70]I don't know, dude.
[169:28.40]Every fucking house is identical and every road is identical.
[169:34.22]One of these houses is the snack shack.
[169:55.65]Okay, turn this off.
[169:56.31]Let's go.
[169:56.57]Look at this goddamn thing.
[170:07.26]Fill this up.
[170:13.30]I got cash, I'm good.
[170:15.82]I can buy another gas tank?
[170:22.25]Okay, so it's 17 bucks to fill this can.
[170:26.26]Full can?
[170:30.58]Very nice.
[170:31.00]Alright, let's go.
[170:31.76]Now we're working.
[170:33.46]Now we're working.
[170:34.00]Let's go.
[170:36.36]Alright.
[170:37.54]What do I want from here?
[170:40.65]Oh, shit.
[170:41.03]No, I don't have that kind of money.
[170:43.15]Um... Summer tire?
[170:44.81]A muffler?
[170:51.35]I could buy... I could afford one of these mufflers.
[170:52.87]Should I get a new muffler?
[170:54.06]Okay.
[170:57.80]I have a torch.
[171:00.76]Dent repair kit.
[171:04.49]Rust repair?
[171:05.63]Something useful.
[171:06.43]Yeah, wouldn't a muffler be useful?
[171:09.13]What about a shock?
[171:12.29]Sport shock?
[171:14.01]Like, that would be pretty sick, right?
[171:18.14]Rust repair?
[171:20.84]Rust repair kit.
[171:23.40]Okay.
[171:24.68]Okay.
[171:26.67]Oh, yeah, the car is rusted.
[171:27.63]You're right.
[171:28.47]Good idea.
[171:31.09]What else should I get?
[171:31.71]I'm thinking maybe suspension.
[171:37.87]Dent repair?
[171:40.21]Yeah.
[171:47.12]I don't want to buy too much shit, though.
[171:50.78]Another gas can.
[171:51.66]I don't think I have... Did they sell it?
[171:56.70]Get some paint.
[171:59.00]Great paint.
[171:59.40]Alright, what color do I want the car to be?
[172:01.96]Uh, robin's egg blue.
[172:10.37]Now, how long does that last, or do I have to buy like a shitload of them?
[172:17.09]Does it last forever?
[172:27.03]Ooh, a steering wheel.
[172:28.26]Cool.
[172:28.72]What's that?
[172:31.02]I probably should get, like, a shock or something, right?
[172:43.76]Shouldn't I?
[172:46.28]No, get food.
[172:48.64]Oh, you're right.
[172:49.18]Okay.
[172:56.44]I can't get that.
[172:58.20]Alright, I'm going to buy a bunch of poutine because I need to buy it.
[173:00.36]I don't, I can't afford it.
[173:02.17]I can't afford it.
[173:03.03]Alright.
[173:04.59]Okay, okay, I have enough to, that engine's going to be pretty cool.
[173:07.95]Oh, no, eyelashes, yep.
[173:13.95]Buy a lottery ticket?
[173:21.21]Alright, I got a full tank of gas, a full gas can.
[173:27.33]A... Underglow kit?
[173:29.77]No.
[173:30.95]A shifter?
[173:34.21]Oh, this is kind of classic.
[173:36.93]This is kind of classic.
[173:41.02]No, no, not this one.
[173:42.10]The other one is.
[173:43.98]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[173:45.30]I have 50 bucks.
[173:45.84]I don't want to waste it because I need gas.
[173:48.12]I want to be able to afford gas.
[173:49.16]Okay.
[173:50.76]So, Snack Shack is right here.
[173:53.77]Right?
[173:54.17]That's Snack Shack.
[173:57.20]Yep, okay.
[173:58.04]They're right next to each other.
[173:58.76]Drive carefully, please.
[174:18.26]Good.
[174:20.58]Vroom, vroom.
[174:22.38]Crappy car mods, read it.
[174:27.81]What the fuck did you say?
[174:29.40]I'm sorry.
[174:29.78]I got like really angry.
[174:31.80]Calm down.
[174:32.24]Woof.
[174:33.02]Foof.
[174:34.90]Foof.
[174:35.54]Foof.
[174:41.03]What do you mean locked?
[174:41.75]Are they closed?
[174:42.59]Come on.
[174:43.17]Are they open in 20 minutes?
[174:46.57]Ah.
[175:01.41]Worse than Skate 3.
[175:04.13]Everybody that's saying that this is the worst stream I've ever done, you are going to be timed out for five minutes for each offense.
[175:12.33]Okay, for your first offense, it's five minutes.
[175:14.79]Your second offense, it's 20 minutes.
[175:16.45]Your third offense is permanent.
[175:21.34]Deal with that one.
[175:28.48]Deal with that one.
[175:41.04]Imagine waiting 50 minutes in front of a restaurant to go in.
[175:48.32]I've done it before.
[175:53.36]Not 50 minutes, but like probably 20.
[175:59.03]So maybe some of you guys can relate to this.
[176:00.57]We'll find out.
[176:02.83]Being on a reverse sleep schedule.
[176:06.06]And having, and like, let's say you're getting up, a long time, I haven't been like this in a long time, but for a while, especially when I was in Massachusetts and I lived in Massachusetts, I was sleeping at, I mean, I would start my stream at 7 or 8 o'clock at night, Eastern.
[176:25.91]And my stream would stop around like 12, 1, 2 o'clock in the morning a lot of times, right?
[176:31.96]Almost every stream was like that.
[176:34.06]So I would be ending my stream at like 2, 3 a.m.
[176:37.06]sometimes.
[176:38.52]And like, I would maybe take a shower after streaming and relax.
[176:42.85]What am I going to do for food?
[176:43.67]And there were breakfast places that opened at like 5 a.m.
[176:49.89]So, I mean, I was essentially on a complete reverse schedule.
[176:54.16]I was going to bed at
[176:58.91]I want to say I was sleeping a lot of times at like 8, 9, 10 o'clock in the morning and waking up at like 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[177:06.33]So I would sometimes I'm really hungry and it's like, fuck, I can't go.
[177:10.22]I haven't gone to the grocery store in a few days.
[177:12.42]I don't have anything in the fridge.
[177:14.89]So like 4.30 would roll around, and I'd be like, fuck man, I'm ready to go.
[177:21.37]And I would go, and kind of, I wanted to like eat, and I wanted to beat all the old people to the restaurant, because they all showed up at like 5.30, 6am.
[177:33.72]So I would get in the car at like 4.30, get there at like 4.45, and just be like, I'm ready.
[177:42.20]And they would open and be like, like, oh, hey, how are you doing?
[177:45.08]Oh, yeah.
[177:45.46]Good morning.
[177:46.22]Good morning.
[177:46.82]It's sunny out there.
[177:47.54]I don't know.
[177:50.25]I don't know what the people maybe thought I did.
[177:53.33]But like I was always not always.
[177:55.75]And I didn't do that often, by the way.
[177:57.41]This happened maybe like a total of five to ten times my whole life.
[178:01.50]I would be there like at the crack of the door opening.
[178:06.19]And I didn't want coffee, right?
[178:07.57]Because I was gonna be going to sleep, so I'd be like, no, no, no, no coffee, no coffee.
[178:11.51]Uh, but I would love the extra large, uh, corned beef hash and three eggs breakfast, please.
[178:18.04]And, uh, a big orange juice.
[178:20.22]I would love it.
[178:24.48]Oh, it's open!
[178:33.34]These are expensive.
[178:41.05]Corned beef hash and eggs is my favorite breakfast in the world.
[178:46.09]Nothing compares.
[178:46.63]So there you go.
[178:48.65]I got here right when they opened.
[178:49.65]I cleaned them out and now I'm leaving.
[178:51.70]Do they have anything else?
[178:55.60]Is there a drive-thru?
[178:56.46]Fry basket.
[179:02.68]I don't think they have a fry basket in here, man.
[179:13.72]Okay, I got everything I need.
[179:16.06]Let's go.
[179:16.82]Let's go work on the car.
[179:26.02]Corned beef is terrible for you.
[179:27.32]Okay.
[179:39.13]It's so good, though.
[179:39.97]But, I mean...
[179:44.04]Everything is terrible for you.
[179:47.72]As long as you're not eating corned beef for every meal, every day of your life.
[179:53.10]We have the same conversation when we talk about, like, fast food, right?
[179:56.29]You eat McDonald's?
[179:58.99]Fucking piece of shit.
[180:00.05]You're disgusting.
[180:01.75]If you eat McDonald's, like, a few times a month, you're fine.
[180:05.51]You're gonna be fine.
[180:07.74]Alright, I gotta find the exit.
[180:19.36]This is not the exit.
[180:24.46]That's copium.
[180:26.36]That's not copium.
[180:30.27]Did I drive on somebody's fucking front deck?
[180:32.69]What the hell is going on?
[180:34.11]I didn't lose anything, right?
[180:36.69]No.
[180:41.51]That's not copium.
[180:42.45]It really isn't.
[180:50.77]Or McChickens.
[180:56.73]If you feel like having a brisket sandwich, eat it.
[180:59.85]But don't eat a brisket sandwich every single day.
[181:03.18]If you like chicken nuggets from McDonald's or Wendy's or Burger King, whatever, that's great.
[181:06.70]They're awesome.
[181:08.26]Don't eat it every day.
[181:10.30]There.
[181:10.88]That's it.
[181:13.12]Done.
[181:15.14]Done.
[181:15.32]That's it.
[181:20.17]And, like, take in some more good stuff, too, to, you know, to even out the bad stuff.
[181:36.63]I don't want to.
[181:38.63]I won't.
[181:39.23]Well, I mean, here, you could, like, incorporate... You just incorporate some more greens and shit.
[181:52.58]Maybe cook with some better oil, right?
[182:02.91]Just keep an eye on your cholesterol.
[182:04.45]Whenever you get a blood test from the doctor, just... We go right.
[182:15.50]Make sure all your levels are okay.
[182:18.72]And be healthy and be happy.
[182:20.56]You'll be fine.
[182:28.93]Or don't.
[182:29.41]Eat like shit.
[182:30.03]Nobody cares.
[182:31.75]Yeah, but you will, though.
[182:33.51]Let me tell you, as somebody that's an old man, you're going to want to treat your body at least alright in your teens and twenties.
[182:45.16]Trust me.
[182:47.62]You really are.
[182:53.20]Dad, shut up.
[182:59.88]I'm serious.
[183:01.04]Let me be the one to tell you that I said the same stuff when I was like 20, 25, whatever.
[183:06.83]I don't give a shit when I'm older.
[183:10.95]Who fucking cares?
[183:11.77]I'm gonna be old.
[183:13.01]I'm not that old.
[183:13.65]20... Yeah, whatever.
[183:29.55]You're a wise elder now.
[183:30.88]Oh, somebody, what happened?
[183:31.88]What happened to my house?
[183:35.20]Honestly, though, did I leave the door open the whole time?
[183:41.00]You're like 50.
[183:41.44]Oh, we're going to turn this.
[183:45.08]We're going to make this a beauty.
[183:46.26]Alright.
[183:50.04]Rust repair kit.
[183:52.49]How do I use it?
[183:59.58]I only get to use it once?
[184:00.62]I use it one time?
[184:03.44]Nice.
[184:24.84]Very nice.
[184:25.50]Okay.
[184:26.62]Dent repair kit.
[184:29.74]Alright, is there any major dents to take care of?
[184:31.46]Like, probably.
[184:35.92]Should I just use it on this car?
[184:37.14]Like, right here?
[184:37.57]Is this working?
[184:53.73]Am I making dents in the car?
[185:00.07]Oh, whatever.
[185:00.41]Oh, I'm just gonna burp.
[185:05.39]What do we have on the to-do list?
[185:09.09]Alright, that's all done.
[185:12.61]Oh, my potatoes!
[185:13.26]36%.
[185:19.96]Do I have to water them?
[185:27.62]What the fuck?
[185:27.98]That's my car.
[185:39.62]Should I not do this yet?
[185:42.34]And is this infinite?
[185:52.13]It runs out.
[185:52.59]Okay.
[185:59.63]It's infinite.
[186:00.57]It's no, it's not.
[186:02.75]Test it out.
[186:13.18]I think it might be infinite.
[186:16.55]I think so.
[186:16.89]I think, yeah, it's infinite.
[186:29.18]It is.
[186:29.38]Alright.
[186:29.68]Well, let's... I know we can do the rust and everything first, but whatever.
[186:36.50]This is looking alright.
[186:46.62]Leave some parts while it's cool.
[186:47.88]No, I want it to be blue.
[186:56.44]So I have to buy a shitload of those rust repair kits.
[186:59.64]So we have to do way more wood.
[187:05.98]Yeah, just eat alright.
[187:06.94]Don't, you know... If you can.
[187:09.50]Sometimes it can be hard.
[187:10.90]Trust me, I get it.
[187:17.27]It's empty.
[187:18.19]You actually can't run out.
[187:30.92]Did it go in?
[187:31.68]Okay.
[187:34.63]That looks way better than it did before, and whatever.
[187:36.63]Who cares?
[187:36.99]Okay, so now... Oh, I got this blue.
[187:40.33]I'll save that.
[187:41.99]Can I drive this thing?
[187:44.74]Does this thing actually drive?
[187:46.14]Can I actually drive the car?
[187:53.33]I can!
[187:53.67]Oh, hell yeah.
[187:56.20]Alright, let's get gas in this thing.
[188:26.04]Very nice.
[188:29.04]Pop the trunk.
[188:29.46]Let's put this in here.
[188:29.98]Okay.
[188:32.86]Nice.
[188:33.70]Everything will be secure in here.
[188:34.90]That's so much better than the trunk.
[188:36.14]Okay.
[188:37.66]What the fuck?
[188:38.18]Alright.
[188:42.08]How do I get it off this thing here?
[188:44.10]Can I just pull this out?
[188:44.72]I have to Jack it up.
[188:54.25]Okay.
[189:03.90]How do you do that?
[189:06.10]I really kind of don't understand.
[189:10.40]That's not a Jack.
[189:11.30]Oh.
[189:15.38]Do I have a Jack?
[189:20.46]Oh, can I just drive off of it?
[189:24.60]It's in the trunk.
[189:26.31]It is not in the trunk.
[189:31.65]Put the Jack on the front.
[189:33.57]That's a log splitter.
[189:37.71]That's a tire pump.
[189:40.83]That's a watering can.
[189:42.09]Wait, there's no water in it.
[189:46.11]That's a tire pump.
[189:47.55]Is it in the truck bed?
[189:49.81]That's another hoist puller.
[189:50.71]That's not a Jack.
[189:52.11]I mean, can I just pull it off though?
[189:53.33]I don't see it.
[190:05.10]I think that's just gonna have to... I think I have to buy it.
[190:11.12]Oh, put the food in the fridge.
[190:12.18]Yep, that's true.
[190:18.14]I gotta piss.
[190:26.33]Did you take a fat dump in bed today?
[190:29.17]No.
[190:30.79]It's kind of a weird question.
[190:34.14]It's a very strange question.
[190:42.83]Use the hoist in the front to lift the front.
[190:44.33]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[190:49.24]I'm going to run out of this stuff soon, too.
[191:06.07]What's in the freezer?
[191:07.47]Okay, we're good.
[191:10.17]We're good.
[191:11.63]Wait, if there's no electricity, how does the fridge work?
[191:18.18]Right?
[191:22.02]I gotta pee.
[191:22.38]We'll be right back.
[191:23.75]I'm not even close to being done.
[191:24.75]I'll be right back.
[191:26.09]Give me like two or three minutes.
[191:46.06]All my songs got moved to another folder.
[191:50.26]And they're not synced up here.
[191:52.65]Sorry about that.
[191:53.31]I'll fix it.
[196:08.44]Okay, I'm back.
[196:09.46]I wanted to speak really softly so I didn't scare the shit out of people.
[196:14.71]He hotboxed his house.
[196:42.22]Ready?
[196:44.96]That was a long piss.
[196:46.74]Um, I refilled my water.
[196:49.06]And tea.
[196:50.46]Water and tea together.
[196:51.22]It's a water, it's a tea.
[196:54.23]I can hear your hotbox.
[196:55.39]Alright.
[197:00.57]Okay, so I need to sleep.
[197:01.95]What time is it?
[197:02.51]What time is that?
[197:04.82]That's... 6 o'clock at night?
[197:09.76]5 o'clock at night?
[197:10.20]What is it?
[197:12.60]I'm not going to bed yet.
[197:14.16]What can I do?
[197:15.62]Let me see if I can get this off the thing here because I don't really want it on there.
[197:34.77]How do I get this off?
[197:37.51]They like bolted in?
[197:47.71]Inflate the tires.
[197:49.93]Ooh!
[197:50.11]Now that's a smart idea.
[198:15.93]Keep pumping them.
[198:18.92]I don't want it past, like, 32.
[198:19.94]What do you mean?
[198:21.64]30?
[198:21.96]Are you out of your mind?
[198:26.16]You don't want 100 PSI in your fucking tire?
[198:29.00]What are you talking about?
[198:29.89]No, like, 32.
[198:36.35]30.
[198:36.37]Not?
[198:36.49]Are you out of your mind?
[198:37.37]35. 32.
[198:52.69]Jerma has only ridden a bike.
[198:56.85]Alright, I might have gotten the log cutting thing wrong, but, like, 30 and 35 PSI on your tires is, like, safe.
[199:04.52]It's not, you're not supposed to have fucking, are you crazy?
[199:09.75]I know, I know this.
[199:11.77]If I know one thing, it's this.
[199:13.33]70 PSI, no, I would not do that.
[199:20.51]Yeah, come on.
[199:23.10]Okay, so now that's good.
[199:25.93]I need to go.
[199:26.49]I know what I'm doing before I go to bed.
[199:28.53]Alright, this game's fun.
[199:36.90]I am gonna cut down some trees and I'm gonna make a shitload more money.
[199:41.30]How's that sound?
[199:43.52]Punk.
[199:48.02]That's right.
[199:48.42]Yeah, I'm talking to you.
[199:49.58]No, no, no, no, no.
[199:50.68]On the second seat in the couch.
[199:52.64]You.
[199:53.36]With the brown hair.
[199:53.90]I'm talking to you.
[199:57.86]Yeah, put the spaghetti down.
[199:59.62]And let's talk.
[200:03.08]Somebody was just like, what the fuck?
[200:05.52]Somebody's eating spaghetti with brown hair on the second seat of the couch.
[200:07.92]There's 15 plus thousand people here.
[200:13.89]The person that was just eating spaghetti on the second seat in their couch with brown hair.
[200:22.76]Me?
[200:23.52]Wait, what?
[200:29.00]Do you guys, I don't know, do you remember when... I think of, didn't one day I'd like look right in the camera and go like, like, hey, hey, Michael Anderson, what's going on, man?
[200:42.91]I used to do that a lot, didn't I?
[200:43.87]And all of a sudden it's just like, what the fuck?
[200:51.53]Like, how did he, what is he talking about?
[200:55.17]Like, hey, Dave Smith.
[201:13.02]Oh, I can cut a pine tree.
[201:21.94]Okay, these are chunky.
[201:25.72]I thought I couldn't cut these.
[201:26.62]Okay.
[201:38.71]I'm just gonna load the truck.
[201:47.48]Alright, that should be good.
[201:48.50]Let's load the truck up, and then I'm gonna sleep, and then we're gonna turn this in.
[201:54.98]I'll chat individually, yeah.
[202:01.57]Oh, well, I can deliver pizza, right?
[202:03.17]Or something?
[202:03.53]Okay, let's park it right here.
[202:31.98]Okay.
[202:32.54]Gonna get dark.
[202:35.36]I gotta hurry up.
[202:38.46]Hopefully I have enough gas to cut this.
[202:49.32]This is less efficient, but just wait.
[202:57.65]I just gotta get it over here.
[203:01.74]So what is the next thing that I actually really do need?
[203:04.36]Like, no messing around.
[203:05.24]Like, what do I need, actually?
[203:08.96]I need something, right?
[203:17.72]Sugar shack?
[203:18.22]Okay, how do I build a sugar shack?
[203:21.96]These are massive.
[203:23.26]These logs are so much bigger than I thought they were.
[203:28.31]Shit.
[203:29.37]This is gonna be difficult.
[203:37.96]Um, okay.
[203:38.88]I'll go get these.
[203:40.14]I wish I could sprint.
[203:46.65]Do pizza stuff?
[203:47.33]Hold on.
[203:56.56]Did you cut down a rubber tree?
[203:58.14]I don't think so.
[203:58.94]Okay.
[204:13.35]I got it.
[204:15.11]I got it.
[204:15.39]I got it.
[204:15.64]I got it.
[204:15.82]Everything's fine.
[204:32.21]Alright, let's see if I'm cutting this up.
[204:33.61]If it even fits.
[204:34.93]Hopefully there's gas.
[204:37.93]Please tell me there's gas.
[204:38.61]Come on.
[204:46.50]How come this is so spooky?
[204:47.34]I think it's just a flashlight outside in a game.
[204:52.80]I think it's just at night it's scary.
[205:09.39]So a sugar shack will do it.
[205:10.49]I'm almost time for me to sleep.
[205:14.00]Spider-Man's gonna get you.
[205:29.12]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what, what, what, what, what?
[205:32.39]Hey, hey, who's doing this?
[205:33.95]Who has my car?
[205:34.75]What the fuck?
[205:36.87]What the fuck?
[205:37.81]Who's driving my car?
[205:45.69]I put the brake on, didn't I?
[205:46.95]Oh, shit.
[205:53.60]The brake is on, isn't it?
[206:01.45]I could've sworn the parking brake was on.
[206:04.00]I s- It's on!
[206:07.78]What?
[206:10.40]I actually thought you guys weren't kidding around.
[206:16.74]Had a guess.
[206:33.77]How do I turn the lights off?
[206:37.09]I don't want the battery to run out.
[206:38.71]Turn the lights off.
[206:39.23]How the fuck is this thing out of gas?
[206:51.96]I might be in trouble here.
[207:03.52]I was here two hours ago doing the same exact thing.
[207:06.50]Somebody just asked for it.
[207:08.16]So, they were asking, how's my TikTok voice?
[207:11.90]And I'll tell you, it's really doing pretty well.
[207:14.12]Although, I'm trying hard not to make it sound like that.
[207:17.36]So, it's still there.
[207:18.75]But, it's not as bad.
[207:20.97]I think it's a seasonal thing.
[207:23.31]So, now I started talking like that, and now it's there.
[207:27.71]This is empty, huh?
[207:29.53]Fuck.
[207:31.31]Um...
[207:37.69]This is bad.
[207:39.49]This thing has a full tank, but I can't drive it.
[207:43.92]Can I just drive off this thing?
[207:46.68]It's got a ton of gas.
[207:50.44]See if I can get to town.
[207:54.90]Call Martin.
[207:55.52]Oh my god, you're right. 555.
[208:39.36]It's what, 8 a.m?
[208:47.85]Martin's on a reverse schedule.
[208:54.45]He's at the local diner right now, the first person there.
[208:57.20]No, he wouldn't be actually.
[208:58.88]7 a.m.?
[209:00.64]Old People Central.
[209:15.12]He's still sleeping.
[209:15.86]Other potatoes.
[209:24.72]44%.
[209:25.10]Hell yeah.
[209:50.33]This is kind of cool, too.
[209:51.27]I haven't even used this.
[209:53.22]Ooh!
[209:55.02]Really?
[209:55.56]How much... Should I do this?
[209:57.18]This'll work, right?
[210:23.02]No energy first thing in the morning?
[210:25.39]No, the meters are backwards.
[210:26.97]Okay, put that back.
[210:34.65]I don't want to use that.
[210:42.57]I have two eggs.
[210:46.36]Let's save the game here.
[210:47.72]Oh my god, no electricity.
[210:50.82]Alright, Martin, will you get up?
[210:52.11]Wake up.
[210:52.57]Please.
[210:52.89]What time?
[210:53.84]It's 8.30.
[210:56.58]I'm stranded here.
[210:57.30]I don't have any gas in my car.
[210:59.96]And I need to ride to town.
[211:04.61]How long?
[211:04.95]When does Martin get up?
[211:23.01]I have to save.
[211:34.12]It's 4 p.m.
[211:35.06]right before he streams.
[211:40.55]That's so bad.
[211:43.01]I'm... Okay.
[211:45.21]I will tell you that moving to the West Coast was really, really good for me.
[211:52.74]Because instead of starting streams at like 7 p.m., 7 to 8 p.m.
[211:57.35]my local time, I couldn't really do that anymore.
[212:00.45]That was just not going to be really efficient at all.
[212:05.30]Because being three hours behind Eastern time...
[212:11.67]I couldn't start my streams at 7 p.m.
[212:13.76]local time.
[212:15.44]There's no way.
[212:16.38]Like, I just wouldn't be able to do that.
[212:18.06]That would be so late for everybody.
[212:20.60]And even starting at like 4, like 3, 4-ish, is still really late for people.
[212:25.74]That's still 7 p.m.
[212:27.18]Eastern, but it's 4 p.m.
[212:28.18]local.
[212:29.38]So it actually, I've been on like a better schedule since I've moved.
[212:35.75]So moving across the whole country made me get up better.
[212:39.57]It's crazy.
[212:42.43]Alright, turn the generator off.
[212:43.90]I'm calling this guy again.
[212:46.56]It was just enough to save the game, thank God.
[212:49.10]Alright, it's like noon.
[213:11.65]Yeah, dude, I want my way to pick you up.
[213:12.72]Alright.
[213:15.81]I need the gas can.
[213:16.41]Where is it?
[213:41.55]Is he actually coming or is it not real?
[213:49.11]Taking like an hour or something?
[213:54.60]Will he drive me back?
[213:55.38]I don't have to walk back, right?
[214:18.47]That's like not... Right click the Jack stands?
[214:31.92]What?
[214:32.92]How did I not know that?
[214:33.74]What's up man?
[214:47.04]Hey, what's up man?
[214:49.45]Uh, car's running just fine.
[214:51.79]Turns out I don't actually need you.
[214:55.55]Thanks, dude.
[214:55.93]Appreciate it.
[214:58.17]You got a cool tire in there.
[215:09.29]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[215:10.49]That's mine!
[215:11.67]That's mine!
[215:41.75]What the fuck?
[215:45.21]No, where's the... Why do I... Who puts a parking brake on right here?
[215:48.95]Close the... Parking brake?
[215:55.88]Why is the parking... Where's the parking brake on this car?
[216:07.45]God damn it.
[216:09.29]How do I get a gas can back?
[216:17.55]What do I do?
[216:18.20]Do I have to call him back?
[216:23.63]Don't even tell me that.
[216:24.79]Seriously.
[216:43.66]Martin's already on the road.
[216:45.14]I have to go fucking hunt him down.
[216:47.82]You gotta be shitting me.
[216:48.93]How do I get out of... He went this way.
[217:15.35]I don't know where he went.
[217:31.71]He's in town?
[217:34.79]Go to the town.
[217:36.99]Oh, the lost items guy.
[217:38.19]That's right.
[217:38.61]Okay.
[217:39.75]Where's the lost items guy?
[217:43.23]What a pain in the ass.
[217:45.85]I gotta go the other way, then.
[217:47.39]This is the wrong way.
[217:52.56]Is there a faster way to shift?
[217:54.86]Because it's not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 anymore.
[217:58.10]How do I shift?
[217:59.02]I don't want to look down here.
[218:05.57]Oh my god, this is such a pain in the ass.
[218:07.63]What the hell?! !
[218:12.41]Um, I'm just gonna go to town.
[218:14.89]How am I gonna get gas?
[218:19.82]No, I'm talking about to go to reverse.
[218:21.80]Not, like, gear shift.
[218:23.02]I don't know how am I gonna- I gotta go talk to the guy.
[218:29.10]Whatever, let's go to town.
[218:30.68]I could restart the save.
[218:35.65]I think I'm just gonna restart the save.
[218:37.17]Yeah, fuck this.
[218:43.15]That was like, yeah, that was like five minutes ago.
[218:44.92]Okay.
[218:56.38]Same thing applies here.
[218:57.26]This time I'm actually going to get in the car, which is so, I don't know what happened.
[219:02.21]He just, maybe he got annoyed that I wasn't there.
[219:15.32]Okay, he's on his way.
[219:19.08]Something's running.
[219:21.42]Alright, okay.
[219:22.40]Alright, gas can.
[219:24.94]Pick it up.
[219:27.83]In the meantime, I actually can do this because it's going to take a minute to get here.
[219:33.23]Stuff that's caught up, just put it in the trunk because I know I'm going to use it.
[219:35.67]Might as well just get this out of the way.
[219:47.35]Is this cut?
[219:49.45]No, I don't think so.
[219:51.61]It does not look cut.
[220:03.38]Are you torturing yourself with this game?
[220:06.18]No, if I wasn't enjoying it, at least it's fun to play.
[220:09.81]Just to fuck around.
[220:11.45]I would not be playing it if I didn't enjoy it at least enough to play it.
[220:14.35]So don't worry.
[220:15.45]I'm having fun.
[220:22.75]Rewater the plants.
[220:23.51]That's a good call.
[220:24.73]Yep.
[220:37.37]Where did it... I don't know where the fuck it went.
[220:40.55]I gotta go.
[220:43.25]What's up?
[220:49.43]Let's go!
[221:02.61]You are adorable today, Jason.
[221:04.39]I'm sorry.
[221:28.05]Let's go!
[221:50.81]Wait, he actually... What?
[221:52.43]What the fuck?
[221:55.16]I'm not drinking or smelling the gas.
[221:59.50]I'm just holding it over here.
[222:02.02]Oh my goddammit.
[222:03.32]I'm not driving with Martin anymore.
[222:04.54]I'm not getting in the car with Martin.
[222:08.25]No, I...
[222:18.99]So how do I get back?
[222:27.18]How am I supposed to get back to my house?
[222:28.54]Bro, where are you going?
[222:33.95]Martin?
[222:36.49]Martin?
[222:48.22]Hey!
[222:51.89]Are you going to wait here?
[223:07.97]Um.
[223:14.49]Thanks, Martin.
[223:19.15]Wait, did we just lock ourselves out of here?
[223:26.56]Please remember where this is, because I don't.
[223:29.27]Um... Okay.
[223:38.28]Uh... Right under the big Christmas tree.
[223:48.17]Where's the...
[223:53.75]What do I do?
[223:54.73]Go in his house.
[223:55.57]That's Martin's house?
[223:58.33]Okay, that's Martin's house right there?
[224:00.13]Okay, I gotta try to burn that into memory somehow.
[224:12.59]It's like to the right of the church.
[224:22.32]Okay, so from the church's front entrance, it's, like, to the right and straight.
[224:25.80]Alright, guys, so where... How am I... Can I actually get back to the house from here?
[224:31.76]There's the snack shack.
[224:48.24]Uh, I think the gas station's over here.
[224:53.41]I look like such a fucking weirdo.
[224:54.75]I'm just walking around the streets holding a gas canister.
[224:59.18]What am I doing with this?
[225:01.90]Over there.
[225:04.72]A person?
[225:05.38]Okay.
[225:10.37]I only have $26, so I gotta be careful.
[225:22.59]Alright, let's do it.
[225:24.51]I just needed gas.
[225:31.93]I can fill this whole tank here.
[225:37.77]And then I can bring the... I can fill the truck.
[225:41.31]Okay.
[225:46.51]So I gotta go find Martin.
[225:47.77]Okay, so this... I got what I needed.
[225:51.95]The church is over here.
[225:54.21]And then it's over this way.
[225:56.49]Okay.
[225:59.11]Alright, let's go.
[226:04.86]How do you get your maple syrup bar to go down?
[226:07.26]You have to drink maple syrup.
[226:24.66]So Martin's house is over here.
[226:30.24]As long as I can have landmarks burnt in, I'll be able to know where I am.
[226:35.26]Okay.
[226:36.04]Cool.
[226:37.52]Got what I wanted.
[226:38.58]For free.
[226:44.69]So is he in the house?
[226:47.15]He was a look behind the house.
[226:51.03]Wood spoiler.
[226:51.87]Why would you want a wood spoiler?
[226:59.57]this is a shelf alright dude let's go
[228:00.75]I don't know what you mean by this, but I somehow get it somehow.
[228:04.63]Somebody said, this is like when I bring my TV to my friend's house.
[228:10.21]What do you, you mean like you're holding a fucking big ass TV?
[228:15.72]What do you mean?
[228:16.38]Like you sit there with it on your lap?
[228:21.44]Bringing a big TV to my friend's house?
[228:34.30]What, so you guys can play like Smash Brothers at like 0 milliseconds?
[228:49.48]Alright, thanks a lot, man.
[228:52.82]Get me out.
[228:53.24]Get me out of this fucking car right now.
[228:55.94]Get me the fuck out of this car.
[228:57.66]Get me out of this car.
[228:59.38]And get me my shelf.
[229:10.56]Alright, let's go.
[229:11.12]We're good.
[229:11.68]That looks great.
[229:21.53]I promise that one day I will drive this car.
[229:23.73]I can spray paint it.
[229:24.65]I can spray paint it.
[229:27.99]Alright.
[229:28.95]Yeah.
[229:30.77]Alright, we're going all night.
[229:32.63]I'm ready.
[229:33.65]I'm into this now.
[229:49.63]Now, dude, we gotta play on my CRT TV.
[229:52.57]Otherwise, I can't do my chic 50-hit combo.
[230:11.51]I'm gonna chop up so much more.
[230:12.79]What do you have no idea?
[230:17.69]You guys don't even have any idea how much more wood's gonna get chopped in this thing.
[230:21.79]Get ready to snooze.
[230:22.69]I hope you're ready to go to sleep.
[230:26.17]This is not gonna be an exciting one.
[230:40.25]We'll get to the truck?
[230:43.74]Uh, yeah.
[230:47.79]What happened here?
[230:48.91]Oh, when it backed up.
[230:50.04]Right, right, right.
[230:53.06]Okay.
[230:53.36]That's a lot.
[230:55.58]This is going to make me some money.
[231:05.47]I'm going to bring... This is probably stupid what I'm doing.
[231:07.95]I'm going to bring the truck and the chainsaw and the cutting machine to that guy's house.
[231:14.73]And then we're gonna just cut a shitload of wood.
[231:16.93]I'm gonna make like a thousand dollars.
[231:18.59]I'm gonna put a one thousand dollar engine in that car.
[231:20.99]And... It'll be beautiful.
[231:29.32]Let's just take what I have now.
[231:34.20]I fill it with gas.
[231:35.36]What's that?
[231:46.22]You can't cut the trees around his place.
[231:48.02]Oh, shit.
[231:48.36]Well, never mind.
[231:55.13]Don't use the whole thing.
[231:56.31]Don't dump it either.
[231:57.35]Alright, how much is in here?
[232:00.03]I need enough for this.
[232:01.09]How much is in the actual tank here now?
[232:06.53]Alright, that's good.
[232:10.93]That's good.
[232:11.27]There's plenty of gas now in this car.
[232:16.51]It was moving.
[232:17.13]The car was moving.
[232:18.15]The car was moving.
[232:19.09]Did you see the car move?
[232:20.31]I did.
[232:21.13]The parking brake is on.
[232:22.33]Why is it moving like this?
[232:24.75]Why is it moving?
[232:26.37]I have the parking brake on.
[232:30.49]What?
[232:38.36]It's too up.
[232:39.10]It's... What?
[232:41.36]Dude.
[232:42.92]Come on.
[233:14.02]I got it.
[233:14.60]I got it.
[233:15.18]I got it.
[233:16.16]I got it.
[233:17.62]I got it.
[233:29.97]Can I suck it out of here?
[233:46.31]Can I suck it out?
[233:48.33]Wait, excuse me.
[233:49.23]I thought there was nothing left in there.
[233:53.78]What?
[233:53.96]I thought there was nothing left.
[234:03.96]What is going on here?
[234:08.95]I want to tell me how much is left in the tank.
[234:15.93]Huh?
[234:16.37]What happened?
[234:18.85]Why is the HUD turned off?
[234:35.20]Perfect.
[234:37.44]Okay.
[234:37.98]Very good.
[234:38.66]I'm very happy about this.
[234:39.88]Let's close that up.
[234:40.86]Let's cut some more wood.
[234:44.97]I'm ready.
[234:48.93]I have a bunch of logs here.
[234:50.71]I don't think I can fit very much more than this, so.
[235:00.67]He's happy?
[235:01.19]I'm very happy.
[235:01.75]I'm doing great.
[235:05.11]Hopefully you're doing great, too.
[235:06.49]I hope so.
[235:09.79]Smoke on stream.
[235:11.15]I'm not gonna smoke.
[235:11.87]It's not even 420 anymore in England, so whatever.
[235:16.64]What's wrong?
[235:17.32]Oh, I need to drink maple syrup or I'm gonna die.
[235:33.80]Go.
[235:37.55]I might only be able to do one more little batch of this.
[235:42.93]Can we... Jeremiah, can we do a race before the five-hour mark?
[235:49.01]Um... What do you mean?
[235:53.00]I don't know what that means.
[235:57.76]Do I have to... I race in the game, right?
[236:01.70]There's races, yeah.
[236:02.75]I don't...
[236:04.51]My car's a piece of shit.
[236:05.43]How am I supposed to do that?
[236:08.09]That car is... Where's my car?
[236:10.29]Okay.
[236:11.43]Do you think I'm going to race with that?
[236:12.57]Okay, let's put this... I think that's all I can do.
[236:26.74]Maybe one more, but that's going to be it, I think.
[236:29.78]I don't think I can do much more than that.
[236:40.65]Maybe one more.
[236:41.77]What was it?
[236:42.03]Like 300 bucks?
[236:47.91]Do the racing.
[236:49.25]Guys.
[236:50.80]The game.
[236:51.20]The map is in French.
[236:53.78]And I don't even know where to go.
[236:55.26]What do you want me to say?
[236:56.46]Go do a race.
[236:58.50]Huh?
[237:12.99]I'm not mad, I'm fine.
[237:22.67]I think I can get one more tree in here.
[237:25.60]As long as I'm very safe about it.
[237:29.38]Dr. Thunder is good.
[237:30.92]I have not had Dr. Thunder in a very long time.
[237:36.02]Okay.
[237:37.16]I think one more tree can fit in here and I'll just drive over the thing.
[237:40.25]Uh...
[237:43.95]Nah, fucking I want money now.
[237:44.95]Let's go.
[237:45.75]I'll cut this last one.
[237:58.18]That's enough.
[238:00.66]Can I turn this in at night?
[238:03.62]Or not?
[238:09.04]Any lore masters in here?
[238:15.29]No, OK.
[238:15.77]Alright, goodnight.
[238:42.08]Save the game.
[238:46.28]Okay.
[239:11.94]I showed my sister one of your old VODs and she said he's good with it.
[239:16.35]What does that mean?
[239:17.07]I don't know.
[239:18.63]I have absolutely no idea what that means.
[239:20.15]Okay, now turn off the generator.
[239:37.98]How do I turn the lights off in the car?
[239:39.58]I can't.
[239:41.12]Lights.
[239:41.78]Like, I can't turn it off.
[239:47.15]It's right mouse bumper.
[239:50.29]Alright, tomorrow is when I make the money.
[239:52.69]And then I can finally drive that dumbass car off the lot.
[240:04.43]I can finally get that dumbass car out of here.
[240:19.34]It's 5.30 in the morning.
[240:20.10]Plenty of time to eat something.
[240:25.95]Drink some syrup.
[240:28.59]My reserves are kind of going low, though.
[240:31.93]Every night at the abandoned grocery store.
[240:34.35]Car meat.
[240:36.04]Okay, we'll do that tomorrow night.
[240:42.66]I gotta get this thing nice and souped up.
[240:48.26]I need to rust repair kit.
[240:50.42]Some more blue paint.
[240:51.48]So I need how many?
[240:52.00]I have one, two, three, one, two, three, four, five.
[240:57.90]I need like five or six rust repair kits.
[241:03.36]And I need blue that light.
[241:05.30]I need like two cans of that light blue paint.
[241:10.62]Should the spoiler be, I'm going to make the spoiler green.
[241:16.72]Okay, sounds good.
[241:17.30]I need money though, so let's go.
[241:35.48]I swear to god I'm gonna do that every fucking time.
[241:45.50]Alright, so let me think here.
[241:47.28]Alright, I... Uh...
[242:13.81]One more tree.
[242:15.11]I want like three or four hundred dollars.
[242:21.50]One more, I promise.
[242:22.50]Just whatever's right here.
[242:37.04]You can't drive for shit.
[242:39.87]I'm using W... See me with a real car, okay?
[242:49.23]Don't drive a real car with WASD.
[242:51.38]I know that they did it in a James Bond movie, but that's not how it works.
[242:57.22]He sat down with his fucking Nintendo DS and drove the car around.
[243:00.62]True, sure.
[243:01.22]Alright, that's enough.
[243:22.07]Fill it up.
[243:24.41]Because it looks like there's a lot of room at the back of the... Yeah, right here.
[243:27.41]There's tons of room.
[243:31.28]Can you parallel park?
[243:34.22]No, but you don't need to parallel park to be, like, a good driver.
[243:36.72]I probably could.
[243:41.24]I could probably do it pretty well.
[243:44.60]I just don't really need to.
[243:49.14]Parallel park these...
[243:52.94]I'm not going to say the rest of it, but good one.
[244:00.29]That's copium.
[244:01.37]What's with the copium comments today?
[244:04.41]That's not copium.
[244:08.94]I can't remember the last time that I needed to parallel park.
[244:13.62]I just can't think of the last time I really had to do it.
[244:16.67]Where it was like, oh shit, I have to parallel park.
[244:26.04]Alright, that's good.
[244:26.68]No more.
[244:27.36]I'm going to take this can with me because I'm going to keep going to town.
[244:34.28]And I'll fill it up.
[244:36.04]Wait!
[244:40.47]I can't do either.
[244:43.19]Driving is stressful.
[244:44.03]It really is.
[244:50.07]Driving can be pretty stressful, so no, I wouldn't worry about that.
[244:56.16]Especially driving in a big city or something.
[244:58.36]No, don't let anybody tell you it's not.
[245:10.27]The one thing I will say that, I mean, like, Las Vegas is seriously goaded.
[245:17.87]Las Vegas, its highway system is just a square.
[245:22.39]It's just a
[245:27.73]It is so easy to drive in Las Vegas.
[245:29.85]It's unbelievable.
[245:31.25]Driving around Boston was something I hated doing because it was just... It was terrifying.
[245:39.66]All the roads are, like, four inches wide.
[245:46.43]In Vegas, like, there's so many turning lanes.
[245:48.77]There's tons of, like...
[245:52.32]Rotaries, and it's just so much better.
[245:54.66]So much better.
[245:57.46]I think Vegas is one of the best cities to drive in.
[245:59.38]It's one of the easiest to drive in in the country, I think.
[246:05.12]Now, the drivers in Vegas, that's a little different story.
[246:08.62]The roads are great.
[246:09.80]The drivers, on the other hand, would be way fucking better.
[246:16.57]It's actually insane how bad the drivers in Vegas actually are.
[246:24.58]Which is crazy because I'm sitting there going like, man, we have this huge, amazing, like, everything's so easy to navigate.
[246:30.57]Why are people driving around like fucking psychos?
[246:43.06]They're like you.
[246:44.22]No, I, no way, man.
[246:50.85]I'm the person that, in the car, when some crazy driver, like, blows by, like, I'm the one that's going, like, I'm going, like, 65, and I'm just like, my goodness.
[247:03.28]My goodness.
[247:05.76]You, be careful.
[247:07.92]That's me.
[247:11.40]That's what I do.
[247:14.51]And I just shake my head.
[247:15.13]I'm just like, unbelievable.
[247:17.13]You're going to fucking hurt someone.
[247:19.49]That's what I do.
[247:31.08]Come on, 400 bucks, you seeing this?
[247:38.76]Hey, $400, you seeing this?
[247:39.68]Alright, let's keep going to town.
[247:48.60]I'm gonna keep going.
[247:54.79]Alright, I gotta go back, right?
[247:55.91]Because... Hold on.
[248:01.16]No, no, no.
[248:02.24]Just keep going this way.
[248:06.93]Don't lose the chainsaw.
[248:07.77]I won't.
[248:15.19]Yeah, I'm the person that gasps when somebody drives by going like crazy.
[248:19.65]And look, I get, like, oh... 60, you're just gonna go 60, 65, 60, 60, 60, Andy.
[248:27.44]Don't be a fucking idiot in a car, seriously.
[248:29.26]It's... Don't drive that fast.
[248:34.36]There's no reason to go, like, 5 to 10 miles per hour over the speed limit.
[248:37.90]Like, there really just kind of isn't.
[248:39.24]Like, just fucking be careful, seriously, guys.
[248:41.17]Don't be stupid.
[248:55.18]Like, if you're on a road that's like 60, 65, and you're like, I'm gonna go 90.
[249:00.24]Man, come on.
[249:02.44]Just fucking chill.
[249:14.35]My car won't do 90.
[249:24.19]90 is not 5 to 10.
[249:25.27]I'm just saying.
[249:35.48]What is this?
[249:40.58]Whoa, what's this?
[249:44.75]What's going on here?
[249:45.43]I already have a spoiler, but that's kind of cool.

[266:03.11]What time is it?
[266:04.01]Okay, let me... I have energy.
[266:06.89]Let me... Check it out.
[266:12.50]Why does the spoiler keep falling off?
[266:13.94]Do I have to screw it on?
[266:17.01]Oh, green tint, that's right.

[266:19.18]How could I forget?
[266:31.84]Wait, am I gonna be able to... It's on the... I don't think you're supposed to put it on the bridge.
[266:50.29]The tires are deflated?
[266:51.81]No they're not?
[266:58.91]Night vision.
[267:00.35]Ayayay.
[267:04.16]The tires are not deflated, they're fine.
[267:09.74]What the fuck happened?
[267:10.76]Is this tire- is something wrong with this tire?
[267:29.52]Dude, what the fuck?
[267:33.60]How do I keep it on there?
[267:34.58]Do I have to tape it?
[267:43.10]Where's my wrench?
[267:52.35]I have no idea where the wrench is, so whatever.
[267:59.38]Alright, it's time.
[268:02.14]It is almost 6 o'clock, almost.
[268:09.11]Make sure I have gas to do this shit.
[268:14.69]I want a full tank of gas.
[268:21.20]I can finally drive this thing.
[268:31.41]I don't want to use the whole thing.
[268:32.45]Because I need this over here.
[268:42.80]Some in here.
[268:53.46]Some in here.
[268:58.77]Alright.

[269:13.82]Save it.
[269:16.32]It'll be really late at night, and I can go do the race.
[269:21.35]How old are you?
[269:21.89]I turned 19 a week ago.
[269:43.10]That was graduation.
[269:54.63]Are you 19 in dog years?
[270:06.28]You look younger than ever.
[270:08.06]Moisturize.
[270:11.28]If anybody asks me for any actual advice, the advice is actually moisturize your face.
[270:18.75]That's the advice I'm going to give you for anything.
[270:22.86]Wait, I can boost the seed up?
[271:00.65]How do I turn the fucking lights on?
[271:13.83]Oh, look at this car.
[271:40.93]I need the radio.
[271:44.06]This car doesn't have a radio?
[271:45.06]What do you mean it doesn't?
[271:46.56]No way.
[271:49.34]There's no radio?
[271:50.04]Alright, into town and I'm going to do... I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going somewhere in town.
[272:25.71]What, the spoiler came off?
[272:31.79]It is?
[272:43.03]It's so dark.
[272:50.42]It's so dark, I can't see anything.
[272:57.26]Did I go the wrong way?
[273:01.61]I feel like I went the wrong way.
[273:04.81]No, I didn't.
[273:05.11]It's right here.
[273:23.10]Can you play this game in third person or does it have to be first person?
[273:25.56]First person.
[273:32.36]Oh, shit.
[273:32.82]Okay, I gotta... Hey, yo.
[273:38.12]What's up?
[273:38.58]What's up?
[273:42.08]Hey!
[273:42.20]What's up, fellas?
[273:44.57]Alright, alright.
[273:56.69]What's up?
[274:02.01]What do you think?
[274:02.43]What's up, dude?
[274:06.37]What's up, bro?
[274:09.19]Yo, man, even though it's kind of cold tonight, it's nothing compared to how stoned I am.
[274:12.40]You have some for that?
[274:13.46]Just... You have some for the... You have some for Sel.
[274:18.86]Don't bring him in that... I would probably... Wait, I would like to race?
[274:24.39]Good to see you.
[274:29.47]So boring racing here in an almost straight line.
[274:38.14]I tore up the road.
[274:40.62]You look good today.
[274:41.52]My twin cam engine is so fast.
[274:43.16]Imagine when I turned it more.
[274:45.04]How's everything?
[274:46.63]You look good today.
[274:47.27]Thank you.
[274:51.47]Pretty cool.
[274:53.89]Are we ready to go?
[274:58.26]Race to the sawmill.
[275:02.18]I don't know where any of this stuff is.
[275:05.46]I don't- I don't have $50.
[275:06.28]I'll see you in two days, man.
[275:35.50]By the way, call the fucking Kellogg's box you got that fucking piece of shit out of.
[276:03.51]Good one.
[276:10.71]EASY GO- RUN?
[276:11.79]They're just gonna chase me?
[276:15.39]Oh shit, I need to eat something.
[276:21.12]Where am I?
[276:33.55]What's the point of that if I'm just wasting gas?
[276:35.95]There's no point.
[276:42.14]I just literally used a half a tank of gas for no reason.
[276:46.50]I need $50.
[276:46.88]So, you know what we're doing.
[276:53.02]Woodcutting stream.
[276:53.77]What time is it?
[277:01.07]Okay, I need to go to sleep.
[277:03.71]Turn this off.
[277:04.69]I don't want to waste gas.
[277:08.98]This dude's going to end up at level 99 woodcutting.
[277:23.77]You gotta sell weed?
[277:26.83]Go climb the wind turbines and you'll get weed seeds.
[277:29.69]I might buy potatoes over here too.
[277:32.63]I need to check on them.
[277:37.17]How they doing?
[277:38.47]Getting there.
[277:41.51]88%.
[277:41.93]Probably tomorrow.
[277:46.85]Alright.
[277:47.89]Here we go.
[277:49.03]I'm taking my truck down here and I'm gonna fill it.
[277:52.14]I'm gonna try to get like 500 or 600 bucks.
[278:01.11]Chainsaw's in there.
[278:01.91]Let's get this stuff out.
[278:15.26]Everything's empty.
[278:16.40]Good.
[278:17.60]Chainsaw in there.
[278:18.26]Okay.
[278:22.26]Time to cut some wood.
[278:24.77]Everybody's favorite part of the stream.
[278:29.04]Weed is a crop that's been grown and harvested.
[278:32.72]We use this crop to sell it to other residents.
[278:37.66]You don't need to copy and paste an entire paragraph to get me to do the weed thing.
[278:41.93]Let's move.
[278:52.69]Okay, fill the car.
[278:55.95]Wood.
[279:01.11]Right here should be fine.
[279:02.97]Marking break.
[279:03.55]I'm going to keep the lights on.
[279:06.33]Because I think it illuminates the area a little bit.
[279:09.91]If I had it the right fucking way.
[279:12.23]Great.
[279:12.75]Good job.
[279:14.43]Good work.
[279:25.07]We want weed.
[279:25.67]I'll do it.
[279:26.05]I'll do it tomorrow.
[279:27.72]Let me at least get some cash so I can keep playing.
[279:44.00]You can find weed at the top of one of the windmills.
[279:47.99]That seems like so out of the way.
[279:49.29]That seems like really far away.
[279:50.69]Okay, let's do two more trees.
[280:02.62]Alright, give me the chainsaw.
[280:22.64]Okay.
[280:26.82]Dude, what am I thinking?
[280:28.00]Am I, like, stupid?
[280:31.61]Look at this.
[280:32.11]I can just put this shit in the car like this.
[280:44.12]It should stay in there, right?
[281:00.41]I'm looking for at least a thousand bucks.
[281:07.62]This is enough.
[281:08.48]This will get me at least 500.
[281:32.11]That's fine.
[281:32.59]That's alright.
[281:42.35]I'm not going far.
[282:10.68]Nice.
[282:17.26]Quickly and efficiently.
[282:22.10]I'll grow weed.
[282:23.15]I promise I'll grow weed.
[282:35.81]His cheeks are the same color as his shirt.
[282:37.41]It's because my white balance is fucked up.
[282:50.25]That means I have a lot of, like, blood in my face.
[282:52.53]Which is, like, you know, healthy.
[282:57.84]They call it a glow, guys.
[282:59.20]Come on.
[282:59.56]Alright, that's all I got for now.
[283:14.02]Is there a- There's probably a better way to load the truck, right?
[283:23.27]Whatever.
[283:28.11]A healthy 70% total blood level in your cheeks?
[283:30.65]Eh.
[283:31.73]I don't know what's considered supposed to be healthy or whatever, but I feel okay.
[283:36.47]I feel fine.
[283:36.81]What time is it?
[283:39.28]Eh, it's not too late.
[283:42.28]I can keep going.
[283:49.20]I actually probably can put another couple of trees in here.
[283:53.65]We'll see.
[283:54.23]Mmm, maybe not.
[284:05.69]I'm getting hung... I'm getting... What did you just say?
[284:12.46]Do you sleep like a bat?
[284:17.30]Is that why...
[284:22.93]I don't know how they do that.
[284:24.03]How do bats do that shit?
[284:28.17]Isn't it hanging upside down?
[284:29.21]How do they sleep upside down?
[284:31.57]Wouldn't that be just bad?
[284:32.66]How does a bat sleep upside down and have it be like okay?
[284:48.53]They evolved to do that.
[284:51.89]Yeah, but what, like, mechanically, how is that functioning?
[285:01.59]Uh, I can definitely put more than another tree in here.
[285:08.72]Probably two more.
[285:11.16]Oh my god, fine.
[285:24.54]I'm good.
[285:27.66]I'll go get the weed.
[285:28.36]I will.
[285:29.80]Wait.
[285:37.32]These are done.
[285:37.76]88%.
[285:39.62]These will be done tomorrow.
[285:46.13]Probably have a different... I feel like if I read that, that's me saying something weird.
[285:51.35]Different system in the brain?
[285:52.41]I feel like that's like a... Like a... Ligma, like Ligma nuts or something, right?
[285:57.39]What is that?
[285:57.81]What are you saying?
[285:58.53]Say that somebody... Everyone else say that, so I don't look like an idiot.
[286:09.30]A limbic system.
[286:12.20]Yeah, but I don't know.
[286:13.64]I just was reading it for a second.
[286:15.42]I'm just like, wait, is that like a little... Ligma, like Ligma balls.
[286:29.67]I don't know.
[286:31.81]You said it, though.
[286:33.12]Well, I was just saying, is it one of those?
[286:36.38]Because, I don't know, I can't trust any of you.
[286:40.00]I can't trust you guys.
[286:41.42]Sometimes it's, you guys go, I don't know.
[286:52.21]Vinny just hosted?
[286:52.81]What's going on, guys?
[286:56.17]Thanks, Vinny.

[287:28.96]So where we are, it's going to be pog.
[287:34.28]I'm afraid that there's not enough gas to cut all this, but let's find out.
[287:55.87]Welcome to the cutting wood for five hours stream.
[287:58.07]I've done other stuff.
[288:00.97]Like get lost and complain about the map for a long time.

[288:30.65]From there, we'll go from at the weed.
[288:34.74]Potatoes will be done by then.
[288:35.86]I feel like I'm making a Thanksgiving dinner.
[288:49.97]What was Vinny doing today?

[288:53.65]Something cool?
[288:58.40]Wait, one more?

[289:00.04]What's one more?
[289:01.20]Kirby?
[289:03.14]Is that new Kirby game any good?
[289:05.92]Is it the new Kirby game?
[289:06.62]Should I play the new Kirby game?
[289:17.96]I wish this was Strawberry Magic.
[289:19.20]Yeah, it's good.
[289:24.85]Huh.
[289:28.40]Interesting.
[289:36.68]Lego Star Wars 2?
[289:37.76]Yeah, there's a lot of things I could play.
[289:42.21]What should I do next time?
[289:44.91]You want to do like a full-on viewer's choice right now?
[289:47.27]There's like 20,000 people here.
[289:48.55]You want to go for it?
[289:49.55]What do you guys want to do?
[289:54.53]I'm open to suggestions.
[289:58.94]Alright, that's it.
[289:59.74]No more.
[290:09.58]Do Eminem's Beach Party?
[290:10.60]Ah, I played that game.
[290:11.70]It was alright.
[290:18.53]Elden Ring Part 35.
[290:19.39]Did you do Breath of the Wild?
[290:24.01]Mmm... No...
[290:30.34]Not now.
[290:30.92]Not yet.
[290:32.46]I need to be really in the mood for that.
[290:42.97]Ace Attorney?
[290:43.55]I can't play Ace Attorney.
[290:46.25]Alright, let me go over this real quick for a lot of the new viewers that don't know.
[290:49.99]I want to play Ace Attorney.
[290:51.23]I want to play it.
[290:53.13]But Ace Attorney does this thing where every minute to like two minutes...
[291:00.24]The screen goes... And it's a white flash in your face.
[291:07.34]It actually happens like every 15 to 30 seconds.
[291:10.78]It goes... I wish I could turn it off.
[291:21.79]The next time you play Ace Attorney... Just watch.
[291:26.51]It flashes the screen every 15 seconds.
[291:32.17]This is a lot of wood.
[291:32.71]We're good.
[291:33.39]Alright, let's go turn this in.
[291:42.05]If I could mod it out, there's an option to turn the flash off in the newest Ace Attorney game.
[291:46.22]Yeah, the newest one, but not the old ones.
[291:48.06]Everyone wants to see the old ones played on this stream, right?
[291:53.20]I get requests all the time to play Ace Attorney.
[291:58.31]I'm fine.
[291:59.71]I'm fine.
[292:09.86]We're good.
[292:15.86]Didn't lose one brick.
[292:23.28]Do the remade one?
[292:26.58]Switch version.
[292:27.18]You can turn it off.
[292:31.71]Huh.
[292:32.47]Wear shades.
[292:34.13]Just wear sunglasses while I play.
[292:44.96]That would be so stupid, but it would work.
[292:46.74]Alright, who's gonna be the closest?
[292:53.92]How much am I gonna get for this?
[293:06.41]Or like 50?
[293:10.70]Or 25?
[293:11.80]Alright, I'm ready to fucking race.
[293:17.45]Can I do anything?
[293:18.09]It says become friends with Francis.
[293:19.75]Can I say anything to him or do anything with him?
[293:23.16]Can we hang out?
[293:23.76]I don't... We just completed the second floor in the garage.
[293:27.94]So much room for activities.
[293:29.65]Okay, cool.
[293:30.09]I don't think I can go in there, but sure.
[293:42.85]Okay, $425.
[293:43.94]I have gas.
[293:44.86]I'm going to go bet, and I'm going to go race.
[293:46.34]And I'm going to go sleep, and I'm going to come back, and I'm going to race.
[293:49.12]Sounds fun.
[293:49.98]Let's do it.
[294:17.48]Is this wasting gas?
[294:20.75]Is it?
[294:20.95]It takes more gas to back up.
[294:38.32]Oh, my spoiler's back!
[294:43.32]That's actually cool.
[294:45.00]Didn't I lose it?
[294:45.72]Oh, I reloaded the game.
[294:46.86]That's right.
[294:50.04]So that means I have to do the tires again then.
[294:51.72]This one especially?
[294:56.75]No.
[294:57.33]Maybe I did.
[294:57.63]Did I save it after doing that?
[294:58.57]Yeah, I did.
[295:00.19]Okay.
[295:00.57]Alright.
[295:00.97]I'm ready to do it.
[295:01.55]Let's go.
[295:02.95]Rest up.
[295:08.62]I'll save the game when I get up.
[295:16.76]Hold the spoiler down.
[295:19.81]Okay.
[295:27.85]How do I bolt the spoiler down?
[295:29.13]Do I have a thing to do that?
[295:43.49]Doesn't look like there's a slot for it.
[295:50.54]Is there a slot for this?
[295:51.92]I don't see one.
[295:52.44]I need the wrench.
[295:54.29]Okay.
[295:58.03]What do they do with the wrench?
[296:12.92]Where's the wrench?
[296:14.36]Dude, where's the wrench?
[296:17.34]Thank you.
[296:35.84]Uh... Oh!
[296:47.12]Got it.
[296:54.66]Is it on there now?
[296:55.20]Do I need two?
[297:02.02]I'm ready.
[297:05.19]Turn this on, save the game, and let's go, Riz.
[297:18.29]Very cool.
[297:20.24]Almost time.
[297:21.30]Night, night, night, right?
[297:22.24]Night time?
[297:31.08]Stanley Parable, Ultra Deluxe.
[297:38.92]It'll be nighttime when I'm done with this.
[297:44.89]Don't yawn.
[297:53.78]We didn't decide what game.
[297:57.24]I don't know.
[297:57.66]I'm down for whatever.
[297:58.54]What's something that I haven't done that you guys would like to see?
[298:14.63]Should we do Ape Escape?
[298:20.90]How about Paper Mario?
[298:22.18]Uh, no.
[298:28.24]Yeah, I've heard of that game.
[298:30.40]Iron Lung?
[298:31.86]Should we do Iron Lung?
[298:37.08]That game's only like an hour and a half long though, right?
[298:40.99]We'd have to do something else.
[298:43.82]Alright, well, next stream I'm going to do Iron Lung.
[298:47.61]And... Something else.
[298:59.50]No, I'm not stopping the stream right now.
[299:02.24]I have to win.
[299:02.84]I have to do at least race one time.
[299:04.44]I got plenty of gas, right?
[299:20.74]I can't find the lights every time.
[299:24.26]They're in such a weird spot.
[299:25.51]Where are they?
[299:25.97]Right here.
[299:26.35]Alright, both.
[299:38.89]They're gone.
[299:49.97]Okay.
[299:51.02]Yeah!
[299:52.20]Yes!
[299:55.78]Let's do it!
[300:03.47]Hit B for third person.
[300:05.73]Holy shit.
[300:09.21]I cannot fucking believe it's taken me five hours to press B.
[300:24.25]Oh, I don't know.
[300:25.01]How am I supposed to know?
[300:35.53]This is so much better.
[300:36.49]You should do a drift.
[300:51.32]No.
[301:13.56]Just play Baldi's Basics.
[301:15.17]No.
[301:16.91]I'll do Iron Lung and something else.
[301:19.95]We need like two or three games next time.
[301:22.87]I have a list of stuff that I haven't played yet.
[301:26.51]That might be fun.
[301:39.39]I could jump out of the car.
[301:46.84]Alright, I'm back.
[301:51.65]Race to the sawmill.
[301:52.77]I don't know what the sawmill is and I don't know where it is.
[301:54.57]So let's go.
[301:54.99]Go beside.
[301:58.59]Alright, let's go.
[302:05.87]Here we go.
[302:07.48]I'm ready.
[302:33.16]WHAT?!
[302:47.67]That's it?!
[302:59.65]That's it?
[303:00.13]How am I ever gonna beat anybody?
[303:10.93]How am I supposed to do this?
[303:11.69]I need to cheat?
[303:13.99]Alright, does somebody else have a car that I can beat?
[303:20.40]I feel like the truck is faster.
[303:22.08]The truck is probably faster.
[303:25.20]I feel like it actually is faster.
[303:26.58]I don't know why I'm using this thing.
[303:33.06]Let's go again.
[303:37.51]Okay, race to the federation.
[303:40.49]This is just $200.
[303:44.39]Alright, this car didn't look as fast.
[304:04.11]How do you reverse?
[304:04.75]I don't know how.
[304:18.43]Jesus Christ.
[304:22.83]Actually, like, actually stuck.
[304:38.03]Where is everybody?
[304:48.06]Did that motherfucker take $200 from me and leave because it's morning or something?
[304:51.79]What the fuck is going on?
[304:56.41]What?
[305:02.80]I drove off.
[305:03.62]I didn't drive off.
[305:04.28]I was trying to turn around and then everybody leaves.
[305:07.34]Like the geek in the fucking wooden spoiler car.
[305:10.79]You take my money and leave?
[305:18.82]Alright, I'm going to the windmills.
[305:19.70]We're doing the weed.
[305:23.95]Fine.
[305:31.03]Reload the save.
[305:45.68]Uh, yeah, uh, sure, uh, uh, I'll give you $200 and I'll raise you.
[305:49.12]Okay, good, thanks, man.
[305:52.43]Okay, let me just, like, turn around real quick.
[305:54.37]Ooh, I don't know, um, I don't know, this is a new car, I don't know how to reverse it.
[305:59.21]Um, don't leave, why is everybody leaving?
[306:02.27]Don't leave!
[306:08.63]This motherfucker tinted his windshield.
[306:10.79]We gotta go.
[306:12.11]We gotta get the fuck out of here.
[306:26.36]Geek.
[306:32.52]Oh, you can use your blinkers?
[306:33.62]How do I turn my blinker off?
[306:45.83]I don't know.
[306:47.60]Where is it?
[306:56.18]How do I turn the blinker off?
[306:57.34]Alright, one, I want to, let me do the $200 one and that's it.
[307:17.87]I feel like that's going to be longer and there's more opportunity for them to make mistakes.
[307:30.49]Okay, we're good.
[307:39.38]Will I take the more expensive track?
[307:40.58]Because I feel like the more expensive one is longer, so I probably have a chance to take a turn or something.
[307:49.62]It's probably harder, but if there are turns involved, then I might actually be able to get an advantage.
[307:56.72]Throwing a tree.
[308:00.24]Whatever happens here, no matter what, I'm going to get over to the windmill and climb the wind... Let's just do it now.
[308:08.60]No.
[308:14.03]I will go to the windmill and see if I can get up there and get the weed.
[308:40.51]Oh shit, it's the fucking green geek again.
[308:42.81]It's the fucking green geek.
[309:07.08]Don't do that.
[309:30.49]God damn it, come on.
[309:40.66]God!
[309:41.18]Okay, we're good.
[309:55.27]It doesn't count, it doesn't count, because you have to touch it.
[309:57.75]Oh my god, he's blazing the- I'm in the fucking dust.
[310:03.90]This is late game shit.
[310:04.94]How am I ever going to do this?
[310:09.59]Look at this.
[310:10.39]Look at how much losing my grandma does her shopping faster than that.
[310:47.32]This geek didn't he didn't belong oh Shit the cars smoking I gotta get out
[311:13.84]What the fuck?
[311:16.26]Alright.
[311:19.54]I obviously can't do that, so my car is way too shitty.
[311:25.54]So I'm just gonna go get the marijuana.
[312:00.88]I don't even fucking care if the hood's up.
[312:02.49]Let's go.
[312:31.58]We're going to get the marijuana.
[312:43.13]Some fucking geek comes over to the street race.
[312:47.75]Like a fucking... Like a 2000 fucking... Like 13... Camry or something.
[312:58.07]Puts lights on it, has a wooden spoiler, goes 70 miles per hour, and misses the first turn and goes into the ocean.
[313:09.69]I, um... Alright.
[313:16.90]Okay.
[313:17.64]So, you're telling me I climb up one of these things, and there's marijuana on top of one of the windmills.
[313:23.02]This feels like horseshit, by the way.
[313:25.70]This feels like absolute horseshit.
[313:29.31]Like you made this up.
[313:31.51]How am I going to climb the windmill?
[313:33.97]You made it up.
[313:53.42]You made it up.
[314:04.54]It's on the game's wiki.
[314:11.12]What the fuck?
[314:13.14]Oh shit, you didn't make it up.
[314:28.21]You've accused chat of lying like five times now.
[314:34.25]I would have bet, I would have bet $10,000 that that wasn't a log cutter.
[314:52.31]Cannabis seeds.
[314:54.33]Oh yeah.
[314:54.73]Is that fall damage?
[315:12.81]I got weed seeds now.
[315:14.81]Who cares if I don't know how to drive?
[315:16.11]I can just sell weed.
[315:44.80]Alright, get me out of here.
[315:50.88]Back to the road, which is over here, right?
[315:52.68]Is the road over here?
[315:55.42]Okay.
[315:57.38]Where the fuck do I go?
[316:02.22]How do I get out of here?
[316:06.22]I gotta get back to the main road.
[316:12.87]Where's the main road?
[316:13.61]Am I on the road right now?
[316:16.27]I think I have to turn around.
[316:17.05]It's so dark, I don't know where I am.
[316:26.35]Okay, this is it.
[316:28.03]Right here, right?
[316:28.56]Take a right?
[316:28.98]Am I going the right way?
[316:57.56]I can't fucking read this map.
[316:58.92]It's too dark.
[316:59.44]I think it's this way, right?
[317:00.72]Right?
[317:00.90]It's right, right?
[317:19.99]I think this is...
[317:36.75]I don't know where I am.
[317:42.56]Windmills are down here.
[317:43.86]I actually don't know.
[317:56.35]I think this is correct.
[318:10.03]Am I just going in a circle?
[318:13.64]I might just actually be going in a circle.
[318:15.12]Nope.
[318:15.58]Okay.
[318:16.18]I have... This is the garage.
[318:19.74]Which was... Uh...
[318:27.31]I think I'm up.
[318:29.01]Okay, I just keep following this road.
[318:45.90]This should take me all the way around, right?
[318:49.04]I can't raid the scrap yard.
[318:50.72]I can't get in.
[318:54.93]Yeah, okay, I remember this.
[318:56.67]This is the next road to go this way.
[318:58.37]You can go down here.
[319:00.29]Which should take me, wrap me around.
[319:01.41]Past the windmills again.
[319:07.09]Which will put me down at the bottom part of that map.
[319:10.84]I think.
[319:17.44]Right?
[319:19.60]Your car is on fire.
[319:20.52]It's not.
[319:21.38]It's just a little smoky.
[319:28.14]Okay, now I'm going the right way.
[319:29.60]Because the windmills are right next to me.
[319:38.41]I go down and then I take a right.
[319:41.45]I think.
[319:44.21]No idea, actually.
[319:44.87]I think it's the next time I can take a right, I can take a right.
[319:55.94]Remember, it's your father.
[319:56.76]We need to change your oil.
[319:59.29]I think that's correct.
[319:59.93]I think.
[320:06.36]Oh, you gotta change your oil every 3,000 miles.
[320:07.56]This is, I just went in a circle.
[320:23.97]I just wish I knew what direction I was even facing.
[320:27.54]The three windmills are over there on the right, so I need to turn around and go that way and then take a right on that road?
[320:40.45]I think?
[320:48.13]We lost.
[320:50.17]Block the enemy race car with your truck or something.
[320:53.21]Hold on.
[320:53.51]I need to get back to my house first.
[320:55.25]This is way more important.
[320:58.41]I just went in a circle again!
[321:06.11]Go this way.
[321:07.25]Back this way, and then I take a right.
[321:14.71]This dirt-ass road.
[321:15.91]Alright, thank God it's becoming daytime.
[321:19.66]I can actually see what I'm doing.
[321:21.82]Here we go.
[321:22.46]Alright, let's go.
[321:23.16]Get out.
[321:28.77]Okay.
[321:29.87]Alright.
[321:33.05]Please don't do that.
[321:34.73]Please don't do that.
[321:46.59]I feel like I'm in a World of Warcraft zone and I'm like, I hacked the game and I modded it and I'm in a car.
[321:52.07]I feel like I'm not supposed to be driving a car here.
[322:15.38]Oh my fucking god.
[322:16.74]I'm back at this Please God help me What do I keep doing wrong?
[322:32.45]What do I keep doing just go back oh?
[322:37.79]Is the thing on the right, that French word in the top right, is the thing on the top right, am I at a wheel don't jacks right now?
[322:47.51]Is that where I am?
[322:49.95]Is that where I am?
[322:52.74]So, if I turn around and just stay on this fucking road, then why does this thing say, like, Jim's Automotive?
[323:08.32]A rock just hit me!
[323:09.30]Alright, slow down.
[323:10.16]I'm gonna fucking relax.
[323:25.72]So now if I just stay on this road, and just stay left, and then stay left again, and just go arou- I don't fucking know, man.
[323:34.89]Whatever.
[323:38.53]So just stay left, stay left.
[323:40.51]Both times.
[323:49.46]Wait, can I just get on the griffin and fucking get out of here?
[324:02.26]15k people are watching you lost in Westfall.
[324:04.53]I'm telling you, man, it's confusing.
[324:13.76]Not here.
[324:14.30]Okay, take a left.
[324:20.68]Okay, left!
[324:23.40]Stay left and then stay left again.
[324:25.11]If I turn around in another circle, I'm gonna eat the monitor.
[324:27.27]I'm gonna just eat it one by one.
[324:30.95]I'm gonna break the monitor over my knee and eat it.
[324:32.53]I'm so- my character's so tired.
[324:44.24]Okay, stay left again.
[324:46.12]And that should be... And then just go.
[324:56.34]I think, right?
[324:57.90]Yeah.
[325:01.33]Got it.
[325:02.43]And then my house should be on my right.
[325:38.14]Please, please, we're so close to Disneyland.
[325:41.92]I'm so... Oh, God.
[325:57.13]I'm telling you, I don't know where it is, honey.
[326:01.07]We already went down that road.
[326:02.47]That says Epcot.
[326:04.43]Maybe if this place wasn't as big as fucking, like, four cities in Texas, we'd be able to figure out where we were going.
[326:11.71]I don't know what the fuck happened.
[326:13.85]I swear to fucking God, man.
[326:15.08]I'm about to just walk home.
[326:17.26]And just use the truck.
[326:18.26]Fuck this thing.
[326:19.58]Chop this thing up and throw it in the trash.
[326:21.10]Who cares?
[327:02.46]Okay, I'm going the right way now, right?
[327:08.07]And just stay through here.
[327:09.49]This is correct?
[327:19.72]No?
[327:28.16]Give me a goddamn blip on the map.
[327:29.88]Like, honest to God.
[327:32.66]Just give me a blip.
[327:33.62]Like, there's so many weird twisty turns.
[327:35.50]Just give me a blip on the map.
[327:38.02]Even if it was like, this was your last known location 30 seconds ago.
[327:41.64]It would be better.
[327:42.60]At least people would know where the fuck I was going.
[327:51.67]Where am I now?
[327:54.02]The weed seeds are fine, they're right there.
[327:55.76]Alright, now if now we're- Okay, now I'm just straight here.
[327:57.98]Straight.
[328:05.35]Straight again?
[328:07.75]Right?
[328:08.23]Yes.
[328:10.89]I'm about to drive into the fucking ocean.
[328:22.83]Buy a GPS.
[328:31.39]The seeds are fine, they haven't moved, I promise.
[328:35.81]Go back, this is the wrong way.
[328:41.66]Oh, it's the wrong way, is it?
[328:48.54]Get me the fuck out of here.
[328:51.35]Oh, dad, um, isn't it like already four o'clock?
[328:55.83]It is, yes it is.
[328:57.42]I think we missed the Donald Duck breakfast.
[329:01.90]It's alright.
[329:02.46]It's okay.
[329:02.94]We're fine.
[329:04.89]Son.
[329:06.23]Son.
[329:07.53]Son.
[329:08.59]Dad.
[329:09.75]Dad.
[329:10.57]Son, I'm coming.
[329:13.57]Son.
[329:25.46]Get me out of the car now before I freak out.
[329:30.10]Give me these.
[329:30.50]It's all I care about.
[329:31.18]I don't care if that thing fucking explodes.
[329:33.24]I don't care if this car explodes.
[329:35.32]I don't fucking care.
[329:36.98]Explode for all I care.
[329:39.02]The truck is way better.
[329:40.38]Why would you not have a truck?
[329:41.82]Let's go over what trucks have.
[329:42.94]Versatility, four-wheel drive, space, speed.
[329:46.72]Don't ever drive a little shit sedan like that.
[329:48.62]Why would you ever drive a sedan like that?
[329:49.94]The truck is 5,000 times better.
[329:51.70]I wish I could put a better engine in this fucking bad boy.
[329:53.84]You know what I'm saying?
[329:54.34]Where's the weed?
[330:21.36]Okay.
[330:24.32]I need to dig.
[330:25.02]We missed the Donald Duck breakfast!
[330:38.51]I have two seeds, right?
[330:47.67]You need a harvest basket?
[330:49.08]Fuck off.
[330:50.76]I don't need a harvest basket.
[330:52.62]It's called use your hands like a man.
[330:55.48]And just rip them up.
[331:04.07]Dad, why are you planting seeds in the ground in our hotel?
[331:08.91]Son, I never think they'll be fine.
[331:13.93]Dad, the only thing we rode was It's a Small World, and that ride sucks.
[331:19.13]That's right.
[331:19.91]I like that ride, actually.
[331:21.73]I rode that three times in a row because nobody fast passes that piece of shit.
[331:26.01]We can ride that as many times as you want, son.
[331:30.49]But I wanted to ride Space Mountain.
[331:32.27]Space Mountain sucks.
[331:35.08]You can't even see it.
[331:35.84]It's just dark.
[331:36.82]Who cares?
[331:37.34]You don't even know you're on a roller coaster, son.
[331:39.94]Trust me.
[331:40.42]It's a small world.
[331:41.18]It's been paying for your buck.
[331:53.87]Dad, don't you understand that it's going to take like four weeks for the marijuana to grow?
[331:59.23]Sunday, I got fertilizer.
[332:00.71]It'll happen much faster.
[332:05.56]Are we planning on being at Disney World for four weeks?
[332:10.06]I have to go to school.
[332:11.54]You don't have to go to school.
[332:12.66]I'm not huffing that.
[332:16.40]No, I'm not.
[332:27.73]Okay.
[332:30.67]He was spray painting the wall.
[332:40.70]Put it away.
[332:41.64]Put it away and get on with it.
[332:49.99]Turn the car off.
[332:52.03]Water the plants.
[332:53.89]And I'm gonna sleep for a week.
[332:55.93]And I'm just gonna eat food and sleep for a week.
[332:58.52]And then I'm gonna go back to that meet and greet at where all the cars are.
[333:02.46]And I'm gonna sell weed to everybody.
[333:05.02]And then it doesn't matter if I drive my car into the ocean.
[333:07.37]It doesn't matter because I'm the guy that sells the weed.
[333:10.25]Precisely what we talked about in the first, like, three hours of the stream.
[333:14.15]I'm not the guy that cuts the wood.
[333:15.67]I'm the guy that...
[333:20.29]I'm not the guy that sells the weed.
[333:22.61]I don't do that.
[333:23.93]I'm just saying that I don't need to... That came out very wrong.
[333:30.21]My point is I don't have to drive the car.
[333:32.27]I can do another activity.
[333:34.71]And it's fine.
[333:44.20]Where did it go?
[333:50.15]Breaking Bad.
[333:53.04]Marijuana is not... Oh, yeah.
[333:56.12]I got marijuana in my possession.
[333:57.82]Oh, yeah.
[334:01.86]He's got weed in his glove box.
[334:07.39]Please.
[334:08.31]It's just illegal in fucking every county in America almost.
[334:14.87]Dad, why are you doing that?
[334:16.31]Why?
[334:16.49]Why?
[334:25.61]Go to bed.
[334:33.56]Breaking bad.
[334:34.94]I've got like a gram of marijuana in my possession.
[334:41.92]Oh, breaking bad.
[334:42.94]Alright, how does it look?
[334:45.90]How many days does it take?
[334:46.75]How do I harvest this?
[334:49.45]A harvesting basket.
[334:50.47]So let me go get a harv- I'm gonna sleep 10 days in a row.
[334:53.35]Harvesting basket.
[334:54.93]Which you get it from the store.
[334:56.52]Which just- I'm gonna go to sleep again.
[334:58.22]Who cares?
[335:01.62]Chill, you just slept.
[335:02.66]No.
[335:03.22]Go to bed now.
[335:03.86]Dad, why do you keep humming that song?
[335:19.68]Why are you doing air guitar?
[335:23.81]It's just marijuana.
[335:31.27]I can't sleep, so what am I supposed to do?
[335:40.27]I guess I- I got- I got wood?
[335:43.97]Car is still running.
[335:48.82]Why is this fucking seat?
[335:53.56]Dude.
[335:54.22]Okay.
[335:55.18]Relax.
[335:55.84]Why is it so far up?
[335:57.08]The car is off.
[336:05.55]The lights are just on.
[336:06.27]Okay.
[336:11.37]Alright.
[336:12.78]I'm going to use the ATV.
[336:15.88]Should I?
[336:16.64]Is there gas in here?
[336:19.91]I haven't drove... Did this yet?
[336:21.31]This sounds like fun.
[336:28.92]How do you... Where is the ignition on an ATV?
[336:33.14]Does it even have one?
[336:37.99]Where is it?
[336:46.73]In the middle?
[336:48.33]How do I think it turns on?
[336:49.51]I thought this thing here.
[336:50.45]How do I drive it?
[337:00.70]Parking brake.
[337:13.91]It obviously has gas.
[337:19.24]Put it in gear?
[337:23.69]How do you put it in... Guys, I've never driven one of these before.
[337:36.32]R and F?
[337:49.77]That was fun.
[338:01.84]Um... Alright, go back to sleep.
[338:03.42]Alright, is the RNF on the car too?
[338:18.30]I'm just so awake.
[338:25.76]Do I have enough to turn it on and save?
[338:27.38]Oh shit.
[338:27.90]I'm out of gas too.
[338:34.11]Fuck me.
[338:37.80]Really?
[338:55.76]I'm just going into town and waiting till it opens.
[339:18.76]Excuse me?
[339:25.90]Wait, I already have a harvesting basket?
[339:28.06]Are you kidding me?
[339:41.23]I actually do?
[339:45.75]Where?
[339:53.29]No, I don't.
[339:56.77]That's the Easter basket.
[339:57.67]No, that's the Easter basket.
[340:10.12]That's not it.
[340:11.46]Yeah, I have to buy it.
[340:22.42]Alright.
[340:23.72]Let's go.
[340:24.12]Enough of this bullshit.
[340:28.38]I don't... No, I don't have a... I feel like I've seen it, but I know what you mean.
[340:31.90]Oh, that's a maple syrup can thing.
[340:41.94]Alright.
[340:42.42]I need to go to town.
[340:44.12]Get gas.
[340:45.36]Buy a harvesting basket.
[340:48.48]Be ready to rock and roll here.
[341:20.20]Gas cans in the trunk.
[341:31.44]Why does your car have eyelashes?
[341:34.51]Why not?
[341:37.23]I just wish that they could blink.
[341:44.33]I wish I could like blink my eyes.
[341:47.87]Without having it like mess with the lights.
[341:50.90]Have it be like transparent or something.
[341:52.14]This is not Elden Ring.
[342:12.34]It is.
[342:12.56]What do you think you're watching?
[342:19.45]It's just a shitload of mods on it.
[342:26.48]I'm trying to do the any% super glitch speedrun where I beat the game in 18 seconds.
[342:30.98]Where I mod the game to have a car and just drive to Elden Beast.
[342:34.53]And drive through the map and then Elden Beast dies and I hit the split button.
[342:51.64]Alright, here we are.
[342:57.75]What am I doing here?
[343:00.47]Why am I here?
[343:05.65]Oh, basket.
[343:06.41]Right.
[343:06.95]Okay.
[343:07.41]Harvesting basket.
[343:09.75]And I need gas.
[343:25.98]When do you open?
[343:30.17]Just open.
[343:30.67]Let me in now.
[343:32.95]I will pay 10% more than all the products I've listed if you let me in right now.
[343:36.31]Just let me in.
[343:47.51]What?
[343:49.45]It says 8.
[343:49.87]It says 8.
[343:50.43]It was 8.01.
[343:50.73]It says 8.
[343:50.97]Your sign says 8.
[343:54.35]He'd actually need these.
[343:55.35]Okay.
[344:26.72]You're one of those customers?
[344:27.62]I mean, I don't know about that.
[344:33.83]I'm just messing around.
[344:37.11]I'll fill the car too.
[345:08.77]Who's my favorite Family Guy character?
[345:10.01]Uh, probably Joe.
[345:24.25]Can I just use this right now?
[345:27.24]I can.
[345:27.64]Okay, cool.
[345:31.84]Looking much better.
[345:37.87]Actually, not looking bad anymore.
[345:39.59]It looked terrible before.
[345:45.47]Alright.
[345:46.65]Now, should I get the windshield wiper thing?
[345:50.75]Now what?
[345:51.67]Um... Ooh, I can get a muffler.
[346:06.33]How do I put this on?
[346:08.09]I'll figure it out.
[346:10.97]Okay, I got the gas.
[346:13.69]I've got... I now need a basket.
[346:17.31]They don't sell baskets here.
[346:18.29]Who sells the basket?
[346:29.62]They do?
[346:37.84]Oh, it is.
[346:38.20]Okay, it's right here.
[346:38.80]Alright, thank God.
[346:41.10]Let's go.
[346:48.89]What else can I buy here that I need that I could... What else should I get?
[346:53.73]Anything else I need?
[347:00.70]Stock up on poutine.
[347:01.58]That's actually a good idea.
[347:02.74]The snack shack?
[347:03.52]Yeah.
[347:04.62]Speaking of snack shacks...
[347:08.27]Speaking of snack shacks, what do you guys think?
[347:12.59]What should I do?
[347:16.29]Is it a McDonald's kind of night tonight?
[347:18.80]What do you think?
[347:21.96]No?
[347:27.96]You don't think so?
[347:31.19]No?
[347:38.65]A big salad?
[347:39.65]Hmm.
[347:44.58]What is going on?
[347:46.50]Okay.
[347:47.98]Where'd my basket go?
[347:48.90]What's going on?
[347:49.34]What the hell is that?
[347:58.60]Why would you be locked right now?
[347:59.84]You opened in like an hour.
[348:00.86]Oh, come on.
[348:11.17]Come on, hurry up.
[348:13.05]There's gotta be something else I can do in like an hour.
[348:36.24]I died?
[348:49.26]Where's the car?
[348:49.84]Hey, it's 1230!
[349:17.00]I have, like, resurrection sickness?
[349:19.99]For another minute?
[349:32.85]I can spray paint the truck.
[349:34.19]Wait, this is... Don't do this yet.
[349:35.79]I want metallic.
[349:38.65]Where's the metallic one?
[349:39.42]I know I have it.
[349:39.88]It's rare.
[349:41.86]There it is.
[349:48.79]Why is this not working?
[349:54.31]What?
[350:04.84]Oh no, I'm making the fucking Thanos thing.
[350:09.97]Like the Grimace-mobile.
[350:41.15]What's going on, man?
[350:42.79]No!
[351:07.10]But I can't drive this here because both the cars are gonna be there.
[351:28.56]Reload the save?
[351:30.57]But I did so much since then, I can't.
[351:40.07]I need to- I- I'll take the ATV.
[351:42.16]Whatever, fucking who cares about the ATV, right?
[351:44.78]I'll take the ATV to town and just dump it in the ocean.
[351:48.06]Continue, right?
[351:49.74]Who cares?
[351:50.24]I'm gonna ghost ride this into the ocean.
[351:58.58]It has my harvesting basket too.
[352:00.76]God damn it.
[352:08.97]What?
[352:09.23]I'm gonna have to take the Thanos car.
[352:32.10]And then I'm going to have him drive me back and drop me off and I'll get it.
[353:11.30]Hello?
[353:11.80]What's going on?
[353:16.41]Why did I... I just lost control of the car.
[353:24.49]Why did I lose control of the car?
[353:25.61]That was weird.
[353:30.40]I couldn't turn.
[353:30.84]That's going to make me puke.
[353:35.60]I couldn't turn.
[353:36.10]I swear to God.
[353:43.27]I feel like I'm playing Mario Kart.
[353:45.63]The SNES.
[354:07.84]I gave my car back.
[354:08.88]I'm gonna drive my car back.
[354:12.96]Gas up the tank.
[354:14.17]Save the game.
[354:17.13]Harvest the potatoes.
[354:21.47]Alright, where's my car?
[354:33.30]Do not hit that guy.
[354:36.40]Alright, here we go.
[354:38.64]Now...
[354:40.51]Did I buy- Oh!
[354:41.51]The poutine!
[354:43.17]Right, okay, cool.
[354:57.06]My shit still in here?
[355:00.70]Yes, okay.
[355:01.70]Thank goodness.
[355:12.92]Snack Shack is open.
[355:17.18]What the fuck are you... What is happening?
[355:19.71]Why does this keep hap- This car is fucking possessed.
[355:26.13]This car is possessed.
[355:28.99]What?
[355:31.85]Put it in reverse.
[355:53.40]Get the fuck out of the goddamn car just buy the whole entire store worth of
[356:20.99]I just want to sell weed.
[356:22.03]That's all I want to do.
[356:22.69]I want to make one weed sale and then drive my car into the ocean and end the stream.
[356:42.70]Alright.
[356:43.46]I need the mountain on the left.
[356:48.41]Where is that mountain?
[356:49.11]It's like right here, right?
[356:52.68]Let's go back.
[356:56.24]I'll come back and get the truck later.
[357:24.32]Poutine is gravy, cheese, and french fries, right?
[357:26.60]I think I've had it once.
[357:36.62]It was actually pretty good.
[357:39.16]It was pretty good.
[357:40.10]I liked it.
[357:48.21]You kind of really can't go wrong.
[358:02.25]I don't see what the problem is with that.
[358:04.01]If you don't like that, that's kind of, I mean, it's cheese, gravy, and crispy potatoes.
[358:08.15]Like, that doesn't seem like something you could be mad at.
[358:10.53]Oh, it is good, yeah.
[358:23.84]It's good.
[358:32.43]Right.
[358:33.07]Okay.
[358:41.12]Okay.
[358:45.04]Sounds good.
[358:47.62]Gas this up.
[358:53.14]So I can save the game again.
[359:07.64]Just fill the whole thing out.
[359:08.72]Fill the ATV, right?
[359:09.86]Yeah.
[359:11.06]Yeah.
[359:13.98]Why not?
[359:27.26]The muffler's gone?
[359:28.03]Huh.
[359:36.07]The muffler is gone.
[359:40.08]What?
[359:41.28]That was like 150 bucks.
[359:44.57]Is it actually gone?
[359:45.29]It might be in the car over here.
[359:52.69]It could be like stuck somewhere.
[360:12.66]Is it actually gone?
[360:13.48]It's only gone to the seat.
[360:20.38]Really?
[360:20.66]Oh, that sucks.
[360:32.77]Oops.
[360:36.51]It's gone.
[360:38.80]Actually gone.
[360:39.48]Whatever.
[360:39.80]Okay.
[360:41.30]Uh, harvesting basket.
[360:42.00]Let's get the potatoes.
[360:50.49]Whoa.
[360:50.87]78% full.
[360:54.57]It doesn't dump, right?
[361:01.55]I get more seeds?
[361:03.14]Oh, this is actually kind of cool.
[361:04.14]Alright.
[361:04.90]Cannabis is at 14%.
[361:08.17]What do I do with the potatoes?
[361:16.95]What do I do with this?
[361:19.17]You make poutine.
[361:33.51]Um.
[361:35.51]Ow.
[361:39.53]French fry cutter.
[361:40.27]You're missing the frying basket.
[361:41.89]Okay, have we figured out where the frying basket is?
[361:45.73]Because I have no idea.
[361:47.38]I have to buy it from the store.
[361:53.80]Alright, let me save it.
[362:01.76]Why is it so bright?
[362:14.78]Favorite sci-fi character?
[362:16.04]George.
[362:16.34]It's definitely George.
[362:32.15]Grammar's cool too, but it's George.
[362:36.52]Hmm.
[362:48.84]Alright.
[362:52.18]How much time until I can actually sell the weed?
[362:53.92]I need to plant this other potato too.
[363:07.15]20%.
[363:08.19]Another probably 5-10 days in game.
[363:16.73]I want to see what that does.
[363:18.35]And then the stream is ending.
[363:20.49]That's the last thing I'm going to do.
[363:31.74]Everything is so bright.
[363:32.72]25% probably.
[363:48.29]Car running?
[363:49.97]No, it's fine.
[364:03.48]Who said, do George saying a little bit of shpee?
[364:10.08]No, that's too, that's dumb.
[364:15.36]Oh, a little bit of shpee, Jerry.
[364:28.05]You know, it's kind of sad that Seinfeld... I kind of wish that Seinfeld existed now.
[364:34.45]Imagine, like, the George is a streamer episode.
[364:40.97]He would accidentally walk in, like, naked or something, right?
[364:44.73]Naked band.
[364:45.31]It would be about how George got, like, a 30-day Twitch ban.
[364:53.52]You didn't turn off the stream!
[364:54.56]You didn't hit this end stream button!
[364:57.40]I thought I did.
[365:01.10]And then Kramer comes in.
[365:01.93]Yeah, I stream too.
[365:03.75]Another website.
[365:05.35]It's called like Chatterbait or something.
[365:07.53]He's like doing porn.
[365:09.93]And Kramer thinks that George is also doing like Chatterbait.
[365:26.82]That's too specific.
[365:34.71]Go back to bed.
[365:35.33]I want those things just to grow.
[365:36.61]Why chatterbait?
[365:49.41]I don't know.
[365:49.91]It'd be like... Kramer has been doing that, I guess, for a long time.
[366:02.72]And, okay, and George is talking about streaming on Twitch, but Kramer's talking about streaming on, like, Chatterbait.
[366:09.18]So, but they don't, you know what I mean?
[366:11.06]Like, they don't understand that they're different places.
[366:14.58]Until the very end.
[366:17.39]Where Kramer is like, oh, I'm gonna go live on George's computer.
[366:21.89]And he's, like, taking his clothes off, and he's on Twitch.
[366:25.71]And that's when it's like, that's where it stops, and you get the ending.
[366:41.89]34%, we're almost there.
[366:47.78]This is just outside, what am I doing?
[367:00.87]You look very handsome today.
[367:02.35]Thanks.
[367:11.65]Newman is a VTuber.
[367:23.38]And the whole time, Jerry doesn't get it.
[367:25.40]Jerry doesn't understand.
[367:26.96]He doesn't get how it works or why it works.
[367:35.25]He sees Newman walking down the street with a wad of hundreds.
[367:41.58]Hello, Jerry.
[367:43.54]Newman.
[367:43.92]Oh, you're probably wondering where I got all the money.
[367:47.12]Not really.
[367:49.50]And then Jerry incorporates that into his stand-up.
[367:58.07]Oh, it would be a great episode.
[368:18.97]What's the deal with VTubers?
[368:25.09]What are they at?
[368:25.67]I'm telling you.
[368:26.27]I'm just like sleeping and eating until this is done.
[368:28.71]36%.
[368:32.02]God damn it.
[368:32.52]I still have so much more.
[368:35.46]Keep the episode going.
[368:36.42]I don't know.
[368:37.08]It's a thought.
[368:38.46]It's just a fun thought.
[368:48.38]And then George's dad, like, wants to get into it too.
[368:50.76]Who's that?
[368:53.72]George!
[368:54.98]I'm gonna do this VTuber thing.
[368:57.10]I'm gonna... Where am I going?
[369:08.11]How's life?
[369:09.07]What?
[369:09.31]No, I don't want to go to school.
[369:10.19]Where am I going?
[369:16.42]I heard Newman did it for a million bucks.
[369:20.30]He's a millionaire, Jerry.
[369:21.42]He's a millionaire, George.
[369:22.86]A million bucks.
[369:27.73]I have no idea where I'm going.
[369:39.46]No, no, don't.
[369:40.00]Actually, don't stop.
[369:40.86]I'm going to...
[369:46.08]Alright, I can... Ernie Sanders?
[369:58.42]Oh, to get the truck!
[369:59.34]Holy shit, that's awesome!
[370:14.18]Everyone's doing this weird thing where they find everything you say funny and is omegalulling everything you say.
[370:19.18]They're so nice.
[370:20.02]We're going up!
[370:34.49]Omegalull, true.
[370:38.71]They are kind of nice.
[370:39.93]It is pretty fun.
[370:42.66]We want him to feel good about himself, so we do that.
[371:15.65]I would love a Seinfeld in current times.
[371:17.23]I guess that's kind of Larry David.
[371:18.91]That's Kirby enthusiasm right now, right?
[371:30.75]It hasn't been actually funny since the sorcery streams.
[371:36.15]You're saying the first streams that I really kind of really went in hard on on Twitch seven years ago were the only things I ever did that you liked?
[371:48.02]Huh.
[371:50.38]Interesting.
[371:50.84]Where's the truck?
[371:51.32]Can you go a little bit further?
[371:55.06]A little bit further up here?
[371:56.90]That's my stop.
[372:08.73]You're all nasty.
[372:09.69]Stop it.
[372:10.07]Alright, get up.
[372:14.79]Get up.
[372:15.07]Get up.
[372:15.33]How do I get up?
[372:20.42]Thank you.
[372:33.49]I've been watching you for 10 years.
[372:35.39]That's ridiculous.
[372:38.17]I can't believe I've been doing this for that long.
[372:40.65]You know, sometimes you just think... In my brain, like three or four years ago, it was like,
[372:49.59]It was like 10 years ago.
[372:52.25]It's weird.
[372:55.13]It's ridiculous.
[372:58.07]I did not expect it to be going this fast.
[373:05.94]Is this car been on the whole time?
[373:07.12]No.
[373:09.76]Oh my god, I do it every time.
[373:13.92]Three years ago feels like 10 years ago.
[373:21.02]The other way around, right?
[373:22.34]Yes.
[373:23.24]I meant to say the other way around.
[373:30.85]Alright, let's go back home.
[373:32.49]That should be enough time for the weed to grow.
[373:40.66]I need to go that way.
[373:47.07]It makes me think, I know we've kind of been messing around this whole time, just fucking around, but real talk.
[373:55.03]If 10 years went by that fast, another 10 years is, that's kind of ridiculous.
[374:02.84]That's insane to think about that.
[374:04.28]Like 10 years from now, I hope it doesn't go that fast.
[374:18.04]Are you gonna stream in your 40s?
[374:49.38]I'm not even 40 yet, relax.
[374:56.99]He's gonna do something even cooler.
[375:06.97]You know, here's the wild thing.
[375:11.19]Oh, eventually, eventually you're gonna stop doing this, right?
[375:14.23]Eventually.
[375:14.83]Eventually.
[375:23.32]but what when I think of the things that I want to do and there's a lot of things that I'd like to do like going forward right but it's gonna be hard to match like how I feel about this forget about like money forget about anything I'm just talking like to be able to match how I feel about this doing this
[375:48.30]I have other things that I'm equally passionate about, right?
[375:50.98]But... I don't know.
[375:52.80]It's going to be weird.
[375:53.28]It's going to be hard.
[375:56.32]But we're not talking about that right now because that's not happening right now.
[376:01.90]We're not talking about that right now because that's not happening right now.
[376:04.46]Everyone relax.
[376:05.02]What we're doing is we're eating poutine and we're growing weed in our backyard.
[376:09.60]Retirement Randy.
[376:10.57]Not yet.
[376:10.83]38.
[376:14.97]Alright.
[376:15.43]Let's go.
[376:16.81]Get some more water on there.
[376:19.54]I did not say eating poop.
[376:24.30]See, we're eating poop and growing weed in our backyards.
[376:28.94]Son!
[376:44.38]Save the game, go to sleep.
[376:50.73]I'm going to turn this on.
[376:52.47]No, no, go to sleep, then save the game.
[376:54.39]That makes more sense to me.
[377:08.36]Become a COD streamer?
[377:11.80]No.
[377:13.14]No, I don't think so.
[377:15.72]I don't think so.
[377:28.13]You gonna become a family man?
[377:29.33]Maybe I'll become Peter Griffin.
[377:48.26]Peter Griffin in real life.
[377:54.86]You're gonna go back to making TF2 tutorials.
[378:08.44]Become a game show host.
[378:12.06]That's kind of a good gig, isn't it?
[378:13.98]Right?
[378:14.28]If I just, like, was... If I hosted, like, Wheel of Fortune.
[378:20.17]I don't know.
[378:20.55]No one's going to give me that job.
[378:34.27]I would watch it if it was you.
[378:35.25]I'd watch the hell out of that.
[378:39.07]Come on, what is that?
[378:40.17]Almost halfway there.
[378:40.99]We're there.
[378:41.47]Come on.
[378:44.34]How can I make time pass very quickly?
[378:53.61]I could cut some more wood.
[378:58.91]Sleep?
[378:59.59]I can't.
[379:00.09]My energy's full.
[379:07.45]Build the sugar shack.
[379:08.43]I don't even know how to do that.
[379:13.61]Build the sugar shack, but I don't... Buggy pack installed?
[379:21.84]Oh.
[379:22.44]Buggy part.
[379:25.62]This thing?
[379:27.38]Oh.
[379:30.04]I need more buggy parts?
[379:47.20]That's annoying that the muffler's gone.
[379:48.56]That would've been fun.
[379:51.64]Oh, I know why it's so bright, because I'm shining the headlights into the house.
[379:58.19]High beams.
[379:59.91]Actual high beams into the house.
[380:04.12]We were trying to figure that out for so long.
[380:08.14]God.
[380:20.44]Alright, what time is it?
[380:25.47]Were you a teacher or was that a bit?
[380:26.71]I was never a teacher.
[380:33.44]I did substitute.
[380:37.04]You don't need a teaching degree to substitute teach.
[380:45.29]Let's go take a stroll with this thing, why not?
[380:54.41]Why is this dead?
[380:54.93]There's plenty of gas in here.
[380:58.74]Why is this dead?
[381:05.88]No, you don't.
[381:06.66]You don't need a teaching degree.
[381:10.77]You do not need a teaching degree to be a substitute.
[381:15.03]Unless that has changed in the last 10 to 15 years.
[381:19.25]Which maybe it has.
[381:19.93]I don't think so.
[381:28.42]Oh, you still don't?
[381:29.02]No.
[381:29.42]It's probably for a state.
[381:32.64]That does not seem right, to be honest.
[381:35.48]Um... I mean, the issue is, if you had to require, like, a Masters in Education to sub, it might be really hard to find a substitute, because if you had Masters in Education, you'd be a teacher.
[381:49.54]You'd be, you'd do, like, teacher's aid, and then you'd become a teacher.
[381:52.16]You wouldn't do subbing, really.
[381:53.78]Maybe you would, for a little while.
[382:03.89]Different states probably have different criteria.
[382:08.95]I'm sure there's plenty of teachers that start doing substitute teaching for a while.
[382:13.95]And then you move on to like teacher's aid stuff and then again do teaching.
[382:20.83]It would be nice if... Hold on.
[382:24.46]Hold on.
[382:26.36]Hold on.
[382:29.00]It would be nice if teachers made way more money.
[382:31.36]Hold on.
[382:38.54]you know we you know that we pay teachers like such a shit amount of money and the incentive to be a teacher is like not that fucking great really and these are the people that are like developing our children's brains I don't I don't understand how that makes any sense
[383:04.97]Arguably one of the most important jobs in the world.
[383:08.94]And... They make fucking nothing.
[383:12.86]Why?
[383:13.40]That's so strange.
[383:15.86]That's such an important job.
[383:18.18]It's so important.
[383:18.98]It really is.
[383:19.44]Time for bed.
[383:24.19]Let's go.
[383:33.22]I didn't just sleep.
[383:39.72]Most of them can't.
[383:41.69]So, what was it?
[383:44.73]They get the summer off?
[383:49.19]Yeah, but that's, I mean, trust me when I say that having to teach students is like, you need that time.
[384:01.39]You need that time.
[384:02.31]And teachers aren't just kind of lounging around in a fucking lounge chair for the summer.
[384:07.16]A lot of them are planning their lesson plans.
[384:11.42]They might not be in the classroom for three or four months, but they have to get ready.
[384:16.26]They have to get prepared.
[384:19.76]When you go to your class, right, you're not necessarily, oh, I'm just here and the teacher's just got a whole lesson plan ready to go.
[384:30.19]No, there are a lot of shit teachers.
[384:32.07]I had teachers that I thought were fucking terrible.
[384:35.17]But I don't know, maybe if we incentivized being a fucking teacher, and they didn't make, like, fucking, like, like, nine dollars an hour, whatever the fuck it is, like, on the average, like, twelve dollars an hour or something, maybe people would be way more incentivized to be a teacher and take it fucking seriously.
[384:59.52]Turn his mic up.
[385:00.26]Alright.
[385:04.72]Honestly, I don't care how you feel about the world.
[385:07.18]Forget about political leanings.
[385:08.32]Anything.
[385:08.58]Doesn't matter.
[385:10.90]I think we can all agree that... I just spit it by bed.
[385:17.64]Well, we could all agree on that.
[385:19.34]We could all agree on that.
[385:21.90]I think that we really need to make teaching way more incentivized.
[385:27.20]And the lesson plan's got to get updated too.
[385:29.60]I could talk for an hour about this.
[385:33.16]We need to talk about like credit and fucking taxes and how to take care of yourself and shit.
[385:38.41]And because I didn't fucking learn that stuff till I was like in my mid-20s.
[385:43.09]It's fuck, it sucks.
[385:45.71]My parents helped a lot, right?
[385:47.26]My parents like told me some of these things.
[385:50.66]But man, I don't give a fuck about like geometry too.
[385:55.13]Help these goddamn people.
[385:57.46]Help these goddamn kids learn some shit to actually help their life.
[386:01.70]Help their future and shit.
[386:10.14]I didn't give a fuck about geometry 2.
[386:12.68]Geometry is important.
[386:13.90]I fucking hated geometry.
[386:15.12]There's too many fucking lines.
[386:16.46]I didn't like it.
[386:22.63]Insurance.
[386:23.77]Yeah, there's like so much shit to know.
[386:29.67]And dude, you know what?
[386:30.75]A lot of people don't really know what they're doing or what they want to do or what they want to be when they're 16, 17, 18, 19.
[386:39.74]And we tell everybody, oh, hey, by the way, when you're like 17, 18...
[386:45.66]You better know what the fuck you want to do with your life.
[386:47.82]Go to college immediately.
[386:48.74]Go.
[386:50.68]Go to trade school.
[386:51.24]Go.
[386:53.24]I don't kind of know what the fuck I want to do.
[386:57.08]I have this opinion that after high school, there should be a period of a year or two.
[387:05.22]Maybe even a year.
[387:06.70]Just a program for you to figure out kind of without the anxiety of like, oh my god, I got to fucking figure out how I'm going to pay for college.
[387:13.07]I got to figure out what I want to do with my life.
[387:15.31]A gap year.
[387:16.13]A two-year gap year.
[387:17.79]Two years and a gap.
[387:19.45]For you to be able to figure out what you want to do.
[387:22.43]Even if you don't get it completely right.
[387:23.75]Even if you're not completely exactly correct.
[387:25.75]You'll be closer than you were two years ago.
[387:32.10]We just push kids out of high school directly into another thing that they feel like they're forced to do.
[387:41.92]And I was one of those people.
[387:43.72]I was one of those kids.
[387:44.44]When I was like 17, 18, 19, I didn't know what the fuck I wanted to do.
[387:48.73]I thought I did.
[387:49.71]There is a lot of pressure to be like, alright, I guess I'm going to go to college or I kind of have to do something.
[387:57.71]I got to do something with my life.
[387:59.05]I got to hurry up.
[388:03.44]I think we should kind of reevaluate that.
[388:06.39]People will be way better prepared if programs like that existed.
[388:14.97]52%, we're almost ready to smoke weed.
[388:30.68]And this is not like some kind of, wow, what a genius topic you're bringing up.
[388:35.28]Tons of people have thought about this and talked about this, right?
[388:40.20]I think it would be so important.
[388:41.43]Because I think of me when I was younger.
[388:44.61]And if I had some time.
[388:48.25]And I could kind of do like a pre-college.
[388:51.09]Or like a post-high school kind of year.
[388:53.99]Where it wasn't a bunch of pressure.
[388:55.53]It was just, alright, let's figure it out.
[389:07.92]Almost ready.
[389:12.40]And not a big financial burden, a bunch of money you got to spend.
[389:15.87]Because... I'm getting heated here.
[389:22.08]When you start to spend a shitload of money in the years where you're not sure exactly what you want to do,
[389:28.45]A lot of people kind of get strapped.
[389:32.75]And you end up a couple of years in college or even doing like trade school and going into like, you know, one of like the trade unions or something.
[389:40.17]And if you don't have it right, you have thrown a shitload of money into the fucking trash.
[389:48.31]I don't think that's okay.
[389:49.66]I think that sucks.
[389:52.98]Changing your major.
[389:54.46]Tons of people did that.
[389:55.92]Tons of people were doing that when I was in college.
[389:59.43]And it's like, man, imagine if you were able to figure that out, and then you didn't have to have the insane loans for the two or three years, or a year or two, and you're ready to go.
[390:18.66]Tell him, sis.
[390:25.08]jermaExplainingHow.
[390:26.18]Wow, wee, wee, wee, wee.
[390:29.37]That's not what happened.
[390:35.42]Compare it with the rest of the world.
[390:36.52]I just think that we could be doing things a lot better.
[390:41.14]You should do a podcast about this.
[390:47.34]No, no, I'm not smart enough to... Trust me.
[390:50.40]I am not fucking smart enough.
[390:52.22]I am not the person you want to be listening to with this kind of shit.
[390:55.64]I'm just telling you how I feel.
[390:57.90]You do trust me.
[390:58.98]I don't have the resources.
[391:00.52]I don't have the brain to handle this kind of stuff.
[391:04.36]I can speak on a couple of small things.
[391:06.82]I can.
[391:08.22]That's it.
[391:08.54]Come on, hurry up and weed.
[391:12.82]Hurry up.
[391:16.22]You should be prime minister.
[391:17.40]No, I should not.
[391:23.48]Why is the truck in the ground?
[391:25.88]I probably rolled.
[391:26.56]It's fine.
[391:34.03]And also, I think that people are inefficient the more that they're doing something.
[391:43.02]Excuse me.
[391:44.10]I think that a four-day work week increases efficiency.
[391:48.48]Excuse me.
[391:51.12]I'm just telling you.
[391:52.06]I think the more that you have to stay and do something in a row, you get exhausted and you don't want to do it.
[392:02.20]I'm not even a four-day wearer.
[392:03.16]And look, people, a lot of people like to kind of really hunker down.
[392:07.95]I know people that like, no, dude, I kind of like doing like two fucking 13, 12 to 13-hour days in a row.
[392:15.67]And then just give me fucking four straight five days off.
[392:19.20]Right?
[392:23.76]Everyone's kind of different.
[392:28.19]Like the- No, man, I actually kinda like working- I like fucking just- BANG!
[392:31.45]Give me like a big, like, 24 ounce coffee.
[392:35.94]And just- I'm going for 14 hours, let's fucking go, I wanna go.
[392:42.33]Did somebody just BatChest me?
[392:50.87]It was one BatChest.
[392:52.87]And I was like, it was lasered into my brain.
[392:55.87]It was laser beamed into my head.
[392:58.63]I just saw it and I was like, that's a BatChest.
[393:00.39]That motherfucker got me.
[393:02.05]And I just got like mad.
[393:03.21]No, I did not.
[393:07.61]Excuse me.
[393:08.50]Hold on.
[393:08.82]Let me be really clear to some.
[393:10.42]There are people that are saying, oh, so you're a socialist.
[393:13.84]That is absolutely not what just happened.
[393:16.92]That is not what just happened.
[393:18.26]Let's be very clear.
[393:20.42]I want to be incredibly clear.
[393:21.88]That's not what that just was.
[393:24.78]Okay.
[393:25.98]Okay.
[393:29.04]How is a four-day work week and like a two-day work week where you do like two 14-hour days in a row?
[393:36.76]That's, what are you talking about?
[393:42.85]So you hate socialism.
[393:51.17]I'm going to sit here until you fucking relax.
[394:12.78]You admitted?
[394:15.99]I lost 500 viewers.
[394:17.25]Dude, I lost 500 viewers because it's like 4 in the morning.
[394:20.63]It's like 3 o'clock in the morning.
[394:22.37]And every day I get closer and closer to having a voice that's different than what it was five years ago.
[394:32.66]No, I'm not getting up until you stop.
[394:34.98]No, listen.
[394:38.59]All I'm saying is that we do things, we could change it and it would be better.
[394:43.01]We could make some good changes.
[394:45.51]We could make some good changes.
[394:47.77]Get me a podium.
[394:48.87]Put me in front of it.
[394:50.81]And let's go.
[394:52.21]I'm telling you right now.
[395:01.72]He's a million... I think that we could have so many better things with education and treating people a little better.
[395:13.85]Okay?
[395:14.39]What is it?
[395:16.48]I didn't say anything else.
[395:18.30]I didn't say anything else, okay?
[395:27.07]It's like 4 a.m.
[395:28.01]It's not even midnight.
[395:29.05]Well, I'm talking 12, 1, 2.
[395:31.31]It's 2 a.m.
[395:32.35]Eastern.
[395:33.33]And it's like 7 a.m.
[395:34.83]European.
[395:35.21]The next person that calls me Millionaire Andy is getting banned from my chat.
[395:56.10]I don't even have running water in here.
[396:01.92]You talk about how you want education to be a little better.
[396:04.18]You talk about how you want people to have better, smoother work weeks and be happier.
[396:08.60]That's all I'm asking for.
[396:09.86]That's all I'm saying.
[396:10.72]I know I get the millionaire Andy.
[396:14.70]I just want people to have better lives.
[396:18.26]It has nothing to do with anything else.
[396:33.99]That's a billionaire take.
[396:43.33]He's a based socialist.
[396:55.37]Ow.
[396:59.03]I'm calling mom.
[397:08.97]What?
[397:11.07]I screamed at that person.
[397:12.77]That person, get that person out of here.
[397:14.51]I want that person banned for at least 30 minutes.
[397:16.47]I want that banned for at least 30 minutes.
[397:18.03]You're out for 30 minutes.
[397:19.00]And I'm telling you, you're gone for 30 minutes.
[397:20.96]I'm telling you to right now.
[397:22.40]Mods, ban that person for 30 minutes.
[397:29.74]I gotta go.
[397:30.12]I'm out of here.
[397:40.90]I should have talked about how I want education to be better.
[397:43.98]I should have just smoked weed on stream.
[397:46.43]I should have just smoked weed.
[397:48.47]And I never should have said anything.
[397:50.01]And then I never should have looked over at chat and read the guy that said the blowjob comment.
[397:54.05]I'm not doing it ever again.
[397:55.49]I'm not doing it again.
[397:56.61]I wanted to say I wanted the education system to be better.
[398:01.78]Okay.
[398:07.06]It's the worst part is they said blowjob Andy.
[398:10.52]Like, God damn it, man.
[398:11.98]You... I'm looking over at Mod Chat, and they said AutoMod caught that, and he read it.
[398:18.21]Okay.
[398:31.49]He's reading blocked messages now.
[398:33.45]Oh, I'm so sorry, mods.
[398:35.27]That's my fault.
[398:42.54]If only this grew faster.
[398:44.37]We had to sit here and have like the... Let's talk about the world.
[398:55.90]I'm going back to bed.
[399:02.74]No, I know.
[399:03.24]We're just fucking around.
[399:04.00]You know what I mean.
[399:07.54]Yo, yo, you get it.
[399:08.60]You guys are... You guys are... A lot of you guys are smart.
[399:11.26]Maybe a lot of them.
[399:11.92]Some of you aren't.
[399:13.21]Some of you aren't.
[399:14.89]I'd say like 90... I'd say like 90% of you guys are very smart.
[399:20.63]And the rest... I'm sorry.
[399:23.70]Sorry.
[399:26.46]Sorry.
[399:41.10]Okay, now I'm just like kind of, now I'm just poking, right?
[399:44.34]Like, I don't know why I'm doing this right now.
[399:46.32]I'm just like, I'm just, I don't know why I'm like teasing and poking.
[399:52.53]Why are you guys saying you're in the 10%?
[399:58.35]I didn't say this chat.
[400:01.04]Did I?
[400:07.22]I was about ready to doze off because I was feeling the sleepies happening, and then he screamed blowjob, and I woke up.
[400:11.82]That was one of the mods, by the way.
[400:19.14]What did you think?
[400:20.56]Did you think that, like, there was a blowjob in the game, and I was freaking out because I showed it on stream?
[400:27.56]Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry.
[400:28.94]And, like, I was panicking about it.
[400:34.03]Why would I scream that?
[400:36.43]I scream it in point.
[400:40.39]Blowjob!
[400:47.75]I would not say anything.
[400:48.63]I would turn the game capture off.
[400:52.19]Where's my watering can?
[401:06.32]Moral of the story is... There is done.
[401:12.56]Who cares?
[401:22.35]That was clipped and shipped.
[401:28.97]You're a moralist.
[401:30.50]I don't know what that means.
[401:38.48]Anyway, so cutting logs.
[401:39.53]Yeah, anyway, so I'm cutting some logs here.
[401:46.33]If Jerma reads this, he has to do a push-up on stream.
[402:06.52]Wait.
[402:09.09]How many- How many do you guys think I can do, huh?
[402:12.51]How many push-ups do you think I can do?
[402:37.27]Let's make a bunch of people think I'm doing a ton of pushups.
[402:45.92]If I could get the fucking thing to work.
[402:52.63]Oh, it's the other way.
[402:53.09]And then it's going to be horizontal here.
[403:00.27]Because I need to be going that way.
[403:31.21]How many do you think I can do?
[404:43.12]One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven...
[405:59.42]Oh, fuck.
[406:16.40]Oh, fuck.
[406:28.99]ah Jesus man I'm clearly sitting down you can see my like stomach coming up from this bottom I'm clearly sitting down what did that even look right
[407:03.02]Hold on, let me see.
[407:11.07]Let me see.
[407:12.69]I'm sorry for any viewer that joined.
[407:14.47]Wait, what does it look like?
[407:27.52]It kind of looks real.
[407:28.92]It kind of looks alright.
[407:32.61]It actually kind of looks alright.
[407:34.25]It doesn't look that bad.
[407:35.33]It actually really doesn't look that bad.
[407:38.78]It looks fine.
[407:39.66]It looks like it makes sense.
[408:28.10]It was... you were...
[408:32.29]I think it was fine.
[408:33.39]I think it was funny.
[408:34.86]It was funny because I was doing push-ups.
[408:49.02]How do I get this back to normal?
[408:53.37]There you go.
[409:00.33]You... Dude, I...
[409:02.83]It was, it looked like I was doing, I was trying to do like a hundred pushups.
[409:11.45]Yeah, I'm looking, I'm doing pushups.
[409:14.47]Oh my God, that looks like shit.
[409:37.27]Alright.
[409:49.44]The audio?
[409:49.94]Yeah, it's a person doing a shitload of push-ups and it's very stressful!
[410:11.08]Hey, I'm telling you right now, I'm looking at my phone.
[410:13.64]Community Jake has not said anything, so I think I'm fine.
[410:18.14]My mother watches these streams.
[410:19.70]She didn't say anything.
[410:21.16]I think I'm going to be fine.
[410:36.54]I blame the fact that the weed didn't grow.
[410:40.58]Play it back.
[410:42.10]I'll play it back later.
[410:48.26]Your mother saw.
[410:49.10]No, I'm doing push-ups.
[410:51.06]It's like I'm doing push-ups on stream.
[410:53.14]I'm doing like 50 push-ups on camera.
[410:55.62]That's what it was.
[410:56.86]Play it back now.
[411:04.44]One.
[411:09.81]Five.
[411:11.05]Six.
[411:12.92]Seven.
[411:13.48]I'm counting push-ups!
[411:50.30]This shit ain't ever gonna grow, I'm just telling you.
[411:58.18]It's only been five days since your last worst joke?
[412:01.48]I wasn't trying to make a joke, I was trying to fool you.
[412:08.97]That's best one guy moment.
[412:11.07]The guy that said the blowjob thing fucked up the whole stream.
[412:14.56]That fucked up the whole stream.
[412:15.60]Let me just be very honest with you.
[412:16.98]The whole stream got fucked up.
[412:18.74]We were talking about like education in America.
[412:22.24]What the fuck happened?
[412:23.96]What happened?
[412:26.10]Education in America to somebody said blowjob Andy to I'm doing pushups on stream.
[412:32.36]Like fake pushups.
[412:33.24]What happened?
[412:34.07]What actually?
[412:34.85]Somebody bad chested me and I fucking freaked out.
[412:44.12]Alright, let's go.
[412:52.91]Your fly was open.
[412:54.47]No, that can't happen.
[413:02.05]Okay, you can't have two accounts that say omegalull best stream and then omegalull worst stream at the same time to screen cap it so you go the duality of germs chat.
[413:15.42]That's not how it works.
[413:27.58]What earphones do you use?
[413:28.54]These are Bose earphones.
[413:39.66]Oh my god, I was looking at mod chat.
[414:00.59]I have to show this.
[414:01.71]This is so fucking stupid.
[414:03.67]What have I done?
[414:04.82]Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing.
[414:06.14]Sometimes I'm just fucking around.
[414:10.86]God damn it, man.
[414:16.59]This is so funny.
[414:17.45]I know the edits that are going to come out of that are going to be fucked up.
[414:22.15]I'm sorry, everybody.
[414:33.60]What have I done?
[414:53.19]But the thing is, that picture already exists of me, like, with my shirt off, sleeping in a bed.
[415:01.47]Why?
[415:02.48]The context already is there.
[415:04.14]There's already context.
[415:10.54]Oh.
[415:24.01]God damn it, that's fucking funny.
[415:35.61]Double award-winning Andy.
[416:00.32]Duplicate the... I think I have to leave.
[416:06.22]I think I have to leave.
[416:07.48]I think I have to leave right now.
[416:09.42]I think I have to leave.
[416:10.14]I have to leave.
[416:11.36]I have to get out of here, I think.
[416:13.14]I think I have to get out of here.
[416:16.94]Why is the car so far away from the house?
[416:18.54]Where am I?
[416:21.18]No, seriously.
[416:22.56]What's happening?
[416:23.24]Why is the car so far away from the house?
[416:25.09]What happened?
[416:34.08]Oh my god, my fucking head hurts from laughing.
[416:37.80]This is so fucking stupid.
[416:45.78]Oh, you guys are too fucking funny, seriously.
[416:50.10]I don't know what happened the last 45 minutes of this stream, but it has been a shitshow.
[416:54.58]I hope it's been fun.
[416:55.71]I hope you thought it was funny.
[416:58.75]Unstuck?
[417:06.11]I can't get out of here.
[417:07.95]I have to pull it with the... No, no, I'm... I think I'm gonna go.
[417:12.89]I think I'm gonna get out of here.
[417:14.53]I think I have to get out of here, right?
[417:15.78]Like, I have to, like, go take a bath and just, like, think about what I've done.
[417:23.14]How... Seriously, how do I get out?
[417:25.72]How does it fit this perfectly in this ditch?
[417:31.42]Put it in neutral.
[417:32.84]I'll pull it out.
[417:34.44]I'm not leaving until I sell the weed.
[417:42.26]Oh my god, what a disaster.
[417:45.76]They're making it the banner for the Discord, I think.
[418:06.39]My favorite part is double award-winning Andy.
[418:11.25]It's like midnight.
[418:12.71]We just chill and have we're just fucking around.
[418:15.01]It's not What is this I?
[418:26.62]Don't know what this is what is this this is that these edits are fucked up.
[418:31.26]Oh, yeah, what is this?
[418:33.50]What is this one?
[418:34.20]What is this?
[419:01.03]What is that?
[419:01.53]I don't know what this is.
[419:08.59]Is this a DJ?
[419:09.23]Guys, I don't know.
[419:15.37]I don't know what to tell you.
[419:16.88]I don't know why I had to do more than 50.
[419:22.88]I'm thinking about this now.
[419:23.93]You know what it is?
[419:25.49]Let me explain.
[419:26.77]The reason why I did, like, 70 of those is because I was trying to burn time for the marijuana plants.
[419:33.77]And I'm like, alright, I guess I'm just gonna keep doing it because, like, the marijuana plants aren't gonna be ready.
[419:37.53]The game was paused.
[419:47.36]Was it actually?
[419:49.80]What?
[419:50.54]Oh, whatever.
[419:51.06]Who cares?
[420:08.09]Do push-ups with... I got modded here.
[420:20.50]Iconers chat?
[420:21.14]What do you mean?
[420:21.68]What?
[420:22.94]Are you ready?
[420:27.06]No, no, no, no, no.
[420:28.04]God.
[420:34.69]I gotta keep this thing attached.
[420:37.71]I actually might be able to get out now.
[420:41.20]Wait, did Connor raid?
[420:52.04]Connor raid?
[420:52.80]What's up, Connor?
[420:54.28]You came at a great time.
[420:56.20]Because just a few moments ago, we were discussing some topics about education.
[421:02.11]I'm trying to talk about education here.
[421:06.62]Nothing weird happened after that.
[421:09.14]At all.
[421:11.52]We went over a lot of topics.
[421:14.03]You know what's really crazy?
[421:16.63]I was like... I gotta internalize this.
[421:20.27]So, the stream went from everyone being like, Based!
[421:24.79]Wow!
[421:25.68]This is actually a really level-headed talk we're having.
[421:29.10]To... You're gonna get banned!
[421:33.74]TOS, dude, you need to stop doing what you're doing.
[421:38.04]It was within 10 minutes, 20 minutes.
[421:45.48]Oh my god, just hold it.
[421:50.16]The switch up was instantaneous.
[421:57.75]Okay, that's better.
[421:59.17]Easy.
[422:01.29]Stay up here and put the parking brake up.
[422:06.84]Alright, I made it up.
[422:08.60]Are plants ready yet?
[422:18.77]Oh, that was so fucking funny.
[422:20.47]These edits are killing me, they really are.
[422:25.87]Doctor Who?
[422:26.53]I don't even know what these are in context, but I know that they exist.
[422:55.15]That was best one guy for sure.
[422:56.62]I don't know.
[422:57.76]I don't know what that was.
[423:01.84]I think I got derailed like three times and then I did like the push up thing, but it was just fucking weird.
[423:07.13]And here we are now.
[423:23.46]I like how you did that sideways, but all the edits have you at a normal rotation.
[423:41.17]Oh, I fucking love this community so much.
[423:43.51]It's so funny.
[423:48.48]It's so fucking funny.
[423:51.46]You know, see what I'm saying when I'm saying, like, what else can I fucking even do?
[423:56.62]You know what I mean?
[423:57.22]Like, you know, like, eventually I'm going to get, like, probably old.
[424:02.97]I can't scream.
[424:05.11]I can't, like, do fake push-ups wherever I'm doing next.
[424:10.39]I'm not going to go on my game show host and pretend to be sideways for five minutes and embarrass myself in front of fucking, like, a stadium full of people.
[424:21.24]I don't know.
[424:21.92]It's... This is fun.
[424:25.02]God, what a fucking shit show.
[424:26.46]Okay.
[424:27.46]Alright, I'm gonna go to bed, and I'm gonna wake up, and the marijuana will be ready.
[424:31.54]But no, Connor, seriously, thanks for the raid, if you're here.
[424:34.26]It was kind of an interesting time for you to come over here.
[424:38.00]Are you the funny onion ring guy?
[424:41.40]No, that's somebody else.
[424:47.00]You didn't raid?
[424:47.90]Why'd you guys say that, then?
[425:02.68]All it's so close 70% we're so close No, I'm the put I'm the the cringe push-up guy I
[425:26.60]Looks like you have tiny hands in real life.
[425:28.12]They're actually huge.
[425:29.84]They're actually like really big.
[425:32.76]I have huge fucking hands.
[425:47.81]Is this an edit?
[426:07.32]I can't.
[426:09.40]I can't.
[426:10.11]Why am I sitting sideways?
[426:15.01]Why am I sitting sideways in this picture?
[426:47.54]Why is everybody sitting next to me?
[426:59.35]This Dr. Pepper shirt.
[427:00.87]Like, what a fucking weirdo.
[427:06.91]There's another one.
[427:07.61]What is this one?
[427:11.02]What is this one?
[427:11.88]Why is this person putting their hand into this?
[427:14.32]What?
[427:18.05]I'm gonna lose my mind today.
[427:19.35]Why would I be allowed back here?
[427:38.33]I would not be allowed back here.
[427:43.93]What, am I just some friend's dickhead that got back here?
[427:49.45]Was that, is that, that's un, that's edited, right?
[427:52.53]Is this edited?
[427:58.13]I think it's edited.
[428:00.20]If it's not, then, wow, I'm weird looking.
[428:07.96]Oh my god, you guys are gonna fucking kill me.
[428:30.42]Yeah, what's the point of the left side of my face?
[428:34.93]Why do you have to have that?
[428:36.81]You can't just have the... What is this one?
[428:41.11]I don't know what this one is.
[428:44.38]Is this Star Wars?
[428:45.46]You guys are quick with this shit.
[428:47.32]This is quick.
[428:48.78]This is fast.
[428:49.68]They're coming out too fast.
[428:51.74]These are coming out way too fast.
[429:07.57]And again, I'm in a Dr. Pepper shirt.
[429:12.16]Extreme branding on the Star Wars movie.
[429:14.62]One of the actors had to be in a Dr. Pepper shirt the whole time?
[429:23.32]God, you guys are fast.
[429:29.29]Okay.
[429:30.93]Alright.
[429:31.73]Alright.
[429:34.57]Honest to God...
[429:37.20]I'm glad that happened.
[429:39.52]Because at least people can take the piss out of me.
[429:45.68]Oh!
[429:46.06]What the fuck?
[429:46.99]Is this real?
[429:50.69]Alright, this is- No, this is fucked up.
[429:52.44]This is weird.
[429:52.96]This is fucked up.
[429:54.36]I think this one actually might be fake.
[429:56.20]It has to be.
[429:57.48]I think it is.
[429:58.62]What the fuck is- What happened to me on this stream?
[430:01.70]This is fake, right?
[430:02.88]It has to be fake.
[430:03.98]I think it is.
[430:05.99]Guys, I don't know what's going on.
[430:07.27]This feels like I was- I dreamed this stream.
[430:09.31]I didn't do this.
[430:10.09]I dreamed this one.
[430:12.27]I'm gonna wake up in like 15 minutes.
[430:14.11]And it's gonna be like, I have to play this game today.
[430:18.38]No, that's fake.
[430:19.02]It's been edited.
[430:19.50]Of course it is.
[430:22.46]Alright, alright, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[430:26.08]Let's everyone take a step back and relax for a second.
[430:31.05]We're going to take a quick step back.
[430:34.15]Just rewind about an hour.
[430:38.77]You look like a cat.
[430:45.21]We are at 76% for the cannabis plant.
[430:51.33]Pull it back.
[430:53.27]Remember when I did the car?
[430:55.09]It's fun.
[431:09.22]Okay.
[431:10.06]So I need to drink some maple syrup.
[431:12.22]This game's fun, by the way.
[431:13.28]This game's kind of like Long Drive, My Summer Car.
[431:18.49]It's fun.
[431:19.17]It's cute.
[431:20.15]It's fun.
[431:26.65]You look like the Michael Myers cat in the hat.
[431:28.77]It can't be real.
[431:39.26]This is the last thing I'm going to show before I just do the marijuana shit.
[431:56.53]I'm going to lose my mind.
[431:57.39]Parfait, right?
[431:59.28]Was it actually real?
[432:02.66]Whoa, what's going on?
[432:03.48]Oh.
[432:07.68]I think that's what's going to happen.
[432:09.02]Let's find out.
[432:10.14]Turn the webcam on.
[432:14.53]I'm done.
[432:16.19]I think I'm done.
[432:16.79]I'm done.
[432:26.60]This is a Breaking Bad spoiler.
[432:27.90]This is a Breaking Bad spoiler coming up.
[432:33.70]I just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[432:34.64]This is a spoiler for Breaking Bad, and you know what it already is.
[432:37.54]Everyone already knows what it is.
[432:41.14]I don't need to show this.
[432:45.20]Because, I mean, everybody knows what this is.
[432:48.30]You know what it is.
[432:49.46]It's a major Breaking Bad spoiler, and it's shown on the screen right now in 3, 2, 1.
[433:12.19]I don't even know what the context of this one is.
[433:17.57]I've made a grave mistake tonight.
[433:21.08]Spoiler.
[433:21.54]Yeah, how is it a spoiler?
[433:22.62]It's just him lying on the ground.
[433:33.04]That's not a spoiler.
[433:35.66]It's just him lying on the ground.
[433:38.14]He's not dead.
[433:40.06]It's not even a...
[433:49.47]Alright, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more.
[433:52.04]This is the last one.
[433:53.74]No more.
[433:54.08]This is it.
[433:55.86]I'm done after this one.
[433:58.48]I promise.
[434:11.10]Go to the Discord.
[434:12.72]I think the sub-Discord is posting a shitload of these.
[434:14.92]If you want to see more.
[434:19.78]No, I can't even open it.
[434:20.68]I can't.
[434:21.34]There's a shitload of them.
[434:22.28]There's like a hundred.
[434:25.40]Okay.
[434:27.98]I need to eat.
[434:33.26]I'm sorry, mom, if you're watching.
[434:34.74]It's been a wild one.
[434:37.20]Substream is going crazy right now.
[434:42.95]What a fucking idiot.
[434:44.15]Like, I just haven't... Ugh, okay.
[434:46.05]Come on, let's go.
[434:49.16]I need my watering can.
[434:50.65]Wherever that is.
[434:51.25]I have like a stuffy nose now.
[434:52.69]How did that happen?
[434:56.61]Where's the watering can?
[434:57.35]Anybody know where it is?
[435:02.51]I'm almost... I just want to sell weed at that thing and I'm gone.
[435:08.62]Where's the watering can?
[435:14.50]It's on the couch?
[435:15.24]Thank you.
[435:19.69]Oh my god.
[435:20.31]Alright.
[435:38.51]I just want you to see this one.
[435:40.01]Okay.
[435:40.19]Okay.
[436:05.85]Um, I need to chop some wood.
[436:10.05]Because I need... Do I have to do anything else with the weed?
[436:15.18]Once I get it?
[436:17.66]Or is it good?
[436:21.24]I just have to grind it up on the table, right?
[436:27.47]No, I'm not going to smoke it.
[436:28.19]I'm going to sell it at the car thing.
[436:34.19]If I save the game, time will pass.
[436:35.41]Let's do that.
[436:35.79]Can you blow up the gas can?
[436:51.20]I don't think I really want to.
[436:52.16]I think he lost all his brain cells in the last 30 minutes.
[437:02.54]You guys are fucking ridiculous.
[437:06.79]God, I have too much fun on this stream.
[437:09.03]I really do.
[437:09.47]Yeah, I just do.
[437:11.03]It's just bad.
[437:11.93]No, it's not.
[437:13.27]It's awesome.
[437:14.15]Why is that bad?
[437:14.80]I have too much fun.
[437:25.16]Hurry up and go back to being a communist.
[437:36.21]Alright, 80-something percent.
[437:39.25]82, we're almost there.
[437:47.22]Just save it again.
[437:47.76]And we'll go by again.
[437:50.32]We're gonna do this like three times.
[438:08.87]Okay.
[438:10.54]One more time and that should be it.
[438:11.52]I didn't even figure out what I was going to do.
[438:23.32]I think there's food in the fridge.
[438:25.36]Let me cook something.
[438:29.29]Alright.
[438:32.21]Let's go to sleep.
[438:34.77]Okay, and the plants should be ready to harvest.
[438:38.50]I hope so.
[438:39.63]Oh, I have this potatoes in this.
[438:43.59]What do I do about this?
[438:45.15]I don't want weed in the potatoes.
[438:54.11]93%.
[438:54.13]What do I do?
[438:55.07]Throw them in the water?
[439:09.73]I don't... How do... What do I do about it?
[439:12.03]I don't think I can get rid of this.
[439:13.57]In the sink?
[439:19.45]I can't cut the french fries.
[439:22.01]I need the fry basket.
[439:24.47]Cook them.
[439:24.85]Uh-oh.
[439:31.22]I can't... No, it's not in the sink.
[439:32.34]I can't get it.
[439:35.88]Shit.
[439:38.48]I need a fry basket to do anything.
[439:42.16]So can I not harvest the marijuana?
[439:44.68]What happened to the basket?
[439:51.01]Bro.
[439:52.43]Dude.
[439:53.25]Hey.
[439:54.19]Where's the basket?
[439:54.73]It was just in my hand.
[440:00.88]Oh, it went through the wall.
[440:03.24]Can I dump these?
[440:04.02]I feel like I just want to dump this shit.
[440:05.62]I don't want this.
[440:12.90]I need another basket.
[440:16.30]Can I throw it out?
[440:17.02]I kind of don't want to, but should I?
[440:24.25]I went up a thousand followers.
[440:29.72]That's weird.
[440:34.67]You gonna throw up potatoes?
[440:35.79]No, I don't wanna.
[440:36.41]Alright.
[440:37.13]I have an idea.
[440:39.27]If I harvest the potatoes and get to 100%, can I dump it after that?
[440:42.54]Alright, I'll get another basket.
[440:47.96]I can't.
[440:49.14]Let's go use the computer for an hour.
[440:54.50]Where's my gas can?
[440:55.70]I'm so screwed up from the last hour.
[441:01.65]I don't know where my stuff is.
[441:17.76]Hurry up and boot so I can do it!
[441:22.96]900,000 followers, yeah?
[441:24.66]That's kinda crazy.
[441:37.90]That's almost everybody on Earth.
[441:44.14]The road to a million, I think it's gonna take a while.
[441:47.98]I don't think we're going to do that that soon.
[441:49.39]That's going to take a little while.
[441:52.45]We probably have a million.
[442:06.98]I don't know.
[442:08.08]I might not even get to a million.
[442:16.23]Okay.
[442:16.81]It's time for harvest.
[442:22.79]They're ready.
[442:25.33]So, I can't put them in here.
[442:27.85]I need to get another basket.
[442:29.19]Alright.
[442:30.15]I'm getting another basket and I'm done.
[442:32.37]I'm taking the ATV.
[442:33.09]It has gas.
[442:43.14]What's wrong with this thing?
[442:45.30]Like, what's actually wrong with this thing?
[442:53.43]Gas?
[442:54.19]It's full.
[442:54.89]Look at this.
[442:55.19]It's got a full tank.
[443:10.68]Is it in neutral?
[443:11.32]Oh.
[443:27.63]I don't understand what those lights mean.
[443:28.91]Alright, I need the gas tank.
[443:32.05]Is that gonna fit in my little fry box?
[443:34.15]Whatever the hell that is.
[443:49.17]I have to take the car.
[443:58.12]What has more gas?
[443:59.02]I think I left this on all day.
[444:05.34]I got gas.
[444:05.66]Alright, let's go.
[444:07.66]Let's just get this shit out of me for some reason.
[444:19.59]I'm not making that mistake more than once.
[444:22.55]Bet your ass.
[444:40.25]This car is disgusting.
[444:42.05]Why?
[444:50.65]Good night, Mr. Elbertson.

[444:57.41]I'll be done in the next probably 10, 15.
[445:02.77]Thanks for staying up as usual.
[445:05.49]Oh, the next, uh, the plan for the next stream.
[445:07.16]Right.
[445:08.74]I wanted to do Iron Lung and something else.
[445:17.47]Something that's like another hour or two.
[445:29.59]Okay, while I'm in town, is there anything I need for weed, or do I just have to grind it on the table?
[445:34.86]And is there any item I need from the store or something?
[445:38.24]Do I need anything from town?
[445:39.90]Or am I good to go?
[445:44.59]Besides a fry basket.
[445:49.87]I need a lighter.
[445:58.02]When's the next stream gonna be?
[445:58.90]What's today?
[446:00.20]Today is Thursday, technically midnight.
[446:08.39]It was a shitload of subs, wasn't there?
[446:11.31]I missed a shitload of subs the other day, too.
[446:14.19]They were, like, tons of 50.
[446:15.19]I mean, I know I don't, like, shout, like, out subs or bits anymore, but they were a lot the other day.

[446:35.84]I appreciate anybody that subs this channel.
[446:37.42]I appreciate that you would at all.
[446:40.28]But I don't... I took a policy of just not saying anything.
[446:45.82]If you do, you do, and it is appreciated.
[446:48.47]If you don't, then you don't have to.
[446:50.23]Then don't.
[446:52.13]You don't ever have to.
[446:56.41]But yeah, some people give an insane amount of money to this channel still Just like I don't know I just It means a lot I hope I can continue to make streams that you think are worth paying for I Hope so Alright, I need gas first
[447:29.24]And if you don't think so, then don't give me any money.
[447:36.06]Right?
[447:45.84]Bye, Jerma.
[447:47.32]Wait, what do you mean?
[447:48.64]You're leaving forever?
[447:49.28]What are you talking about?
[447:58.41]You're smart.
[447:58.87]That's reverse psychology.
[447:59.95]I can't believe that was a real face that I made.
[448:08.78]Is it not far?

[449:56.80]And I need a fry basket.

[451:21.57]No, no, I don't like that.
[451:22.31]That means that this isn't real.

[451:56.68]It's time.
[451:57.10]There's no car damage, it's fine.
[452:10.82]I'm not getting out of this one, I don't think.
[452:21.67]I don't know how I do this every time.
[452:24.13]How does it get perfectly wedged in?
[452:26.49]How?
[452:28.91]You can't even try to do that.
[452:31.57]If you try to do what I just did, it doesn't work.
[452:35.54]Why does it keep happening?
[452:39.52]Turn the car off.
[452:40.84]I'm taking the truck anyways.
[452:57.39]Alright, I got some marijuana.
[453:03.79]Still extra seeds.
[453:04.57]Alright, what do I do with this marijuana?
[453:10.47]I take it to the table, right?
[453:15.40]Weed grinder?
[453:15.92]How do I use this?
[453:21.02]Ten packs to one weed grinder.
[453:23.26]Pack it?
[453:32.06]How?
[453:32.28]I have to sit first?
[453:36.08]There's a total of zero pack of joint close by.
[453:43.90]Ten joint packs.
[453:56.38]How do I use it?
[453:59.98]There's no harvest basket close by.
[454:02.44]Oh.
[454:12.31]Did I already do it?
[454:25.32]10% minimum?
[454:26.46]Not enough for one pack.
[454:29.42]No, I got it.
[454:29.92]This is it right here, right?
[454:34.16]So I got it.
[454:34.62]I already have one.
[454:37.35]Alright, I'm going to sell this.
[454:40.91]It's time.
[454:42.87]It's time.
[454:47.72]Put it in the trunk.
[454:49.50]Now pack it.
[454:50.76]What?
[454:50.88]What?
[454:56.39]Calm yourself.
[454:59.60]You need 10 pre-roll packs.
[455:07.54]Can I sell this?
[455:12.23]Your vehicles are in ditches, man.
[455:15.55]Can I sell this?
[455:18.89]I think, yeah, I can.
[455:19.75]I'm gonna go sell it.
[455:26.39]What time do I need to wake up?
[455:39.78]I need a gas can that's in here.
[455:40.92]Give me a fucking break.
[455:54.11]420's over?
[455:54.45]Oh, you're right.
[455:57.40]I can never smoke weed ever again.
[455:58.66]Shoot.
[456:24.59]Let's speed it to nighttime.
[456:28.19]I'm going to take the truck.
[456:30.79]Let me get the truck.
[456:32.06]Let me get this out of the ditch.
[456:43.79]Come on.
[456:46.47]Come on.
[456:53.64]I think it's out.
[456:54.94]I should be able to pull it out now.
[457:06.45]How did it go in?
[457:07.15]How did the car turn off?
[457:08.41]Okay, we're good.
[457:22.96]Okay, let's go.
[457:32.66]Alright, give me the weed.
[457:37.54]Now out of the ditch.
[457:38.28]That's good.
[457:38.67]Just be careful.
[457:39.29]I gotta be very careful getting out of here.
[457:44.93]Snow runner?
[457:45.47]Ah!
[457:49.85]Let's do it.
[457:50.29]This is it.
[457:50.63]This is the culmination of the whole stream.
[457:52.81]Eight hours of this.
[457:55.15]You're transporting one pack of joints in a pickup.
[458:04.82]Should I put it on the tray, too?
[458:07.76]Yeah, alright, I'm gonna put it on the tray.
[458:13.71]We're gonna have to light it up or something.
[458:16.35]Where is it?
[458:16.77]What do I do with it?
[458:23.20]Where's the pack?
[458:23.82]There it is.
[458:29.86]Where is it?
[458:36.27]I have 10 joints?
[458:41.83]How do I sell it?
[458:44.09]I didn't smoke it.
[458:44.85]What are you talking about?
[458:45.51]It says 10 in the corner.
[458:54.11]I used it?
[459:04.59]I opened it.
[459:20.68]Go back to the packer.
[459:21.90]Okay, I think I can save it.
[459:26.84]There's zero packs of joints nearby.
[459:32.90]Dude, I... I couldn't leave the house.
[459:37.29]I had to... I couldn't open the fucking door with it in my hand.
[459:42.17]Oh my god, how far away... Does anyone remember when I saved it last?
[459:48.89]How far away was it?
[459:51.68]17 minutes?
[459:52.22]How far is that?
[459:55.58]Come on, man.
[459:59.44]I couldn't open the door.
[460:02.24]It's not that far.
[460:03.09]I was walking around in circles.
[460:11.44]Dude, get up.
[460:23.02]I didn't even harvest it yet?
[460:24.59]Oh my god.
[460:25.55]Dude, I can't- you can't open the door if you have something in your hand, so I have to put the thing down, open the door, pick the thing up off the ground, and walk out the fucking house.
[460:49.20]Oh my god.
[460:50.35]I'm just gonna smoke the fucking thing.
[460:52.53]I don't even have a basket.
[460:55.28]I didn't- I didn't think if I, like, pressed, like, E. I thought I'm- I thought I was just trying to put it on the-
[461:22.68]I didn't know I was gonna, like, stick it in my personal inventory.
[461:25.54]I need to... Do I have enough gas to even save the game?
[461:31.92]Fuck.
[461:35.05]Oh, this is a disaster.
[461:36.07]I... Okay.
[461:42.01]Can I just dump this shit out?
[461:46.05]Can I just dump this?
[461:47.75]What do I even do with this?
[461:49.12]I can't even do anything with it.
[461:51.62]Is there like a dump thing?
[461:53.34]How do I get rid of this?
[462:09.17]So I just have a basket that's full of something I can't use.
[462:11.71]And I can't get rid of it.
[462:24.78]Well, the stream goes on for another 10 minutes.
[462:27.52]Press Y to dump it out.
[462:28.62]Okay.
[462:35.66]Okay.
[462:48.67]I can't even make time pass because I don't have enough gas to turn the fucking computer on.
[462:54.29]Can I just like sleep on the ground for- Can I just like- Can I like- How am I supposed to pass time?
[462:58.91]Get out of my fucking way.
[463:13.78]For the love of God.
[463:15.14]I gotta go buy another fucking basket because I can't dump the other- Because I put potatoes in it accidentally.
[465:19.41]Oh, the misery.
[465:35.14]I'm almost there.
[465:41.35]I just want a soft little head like his.
[465:44.39]My head is hard as a rock.
[465:46.66]You see how big my brow bone is, dude?
[465:49.24]Please.
[466:18.05]I'll be really honest with you.
[466:18.93]I've been playing this game for eight hours.
[466:20.08]I still don't know where the gas station is.
[466:21.46]I just drive around till I find it.
[466:54.99]Okay, alright guys, let's go.
[466:56.33]Oh, push-up edits, those are the days.
[467:00.15]I just want to turn- I don't want to reverse.
[467:10.90]I just want to turn.
[467:33.20]God, fill the fucking can up.
[467:36.50]Fill up the can.
[467:44.33]Can we go to Disney after this?
[467:45.59]Maybe.
[467:47.42]If you're good.
[467:52.78]He's pouring it.
[467:53.54]I'm not pouring it on the ground.
[468:13.99]Okay, sorry.
[468:16.71]So gas in this car.
[468:19.80]I'm so close to being done.
[468:22.12]I just want to sell one weed to one person and then fucking be done.
[468:25.44]We're good.
[468:34.02]It's past midnight.
[468:34.70]Yeah, it's very late.
[468:35.52]It's very, very late.
[468:42.41]You could have walked to Disney by now.
[468:44.43]Okay.

[469:36.66]I'm going back.
[469:37.90]Harvest.
[469:39.36]Sleep till fucking 10 o'clock at night.
[469:41.70]Sell the marijuana.
[469:42.68]Get out.
[469:48.79]This car, seriously, drives as if it has no fucking wheels.
[469:54.35]There are no wheels on this car.
[469:56.55]The wheels are made out of wood.
[469:57.97]It just drives on a straight line.
[470:13.74]Why is he mad?
[470:14.50]I'm not.
[470:14.88]I'm just fucking around, dude.
[470:17.28]He has to see what.

[470:33.01]Here we are.
[470:35.95]Oh, the misery.
[470:37.31]Every single person is my enemy.
[471:13.99]What?
[471:14.55]No, what happened?
[471:15.38]Okay.
[472:12.83]So close.
[472:14.13]We are so close.
[472:15.63]We are so close.
[472:16.42]13.
[472:26.46]Alright, we just need to sleep, drink maple syrup, and get out.
[472:38.47]Oh my fucking god, what are you talking about?
[472:40.79]99%?
[472:41.63]Are you drunk?
[472:42.37]Good.
[473:04.98]This will take me into the end of this.
[473:08.58]I gotta pee.
[473:15.33]Alright, here we go.
[473:15.95]It's sundown.
[473:16.73]Here it is.
[473:17.13]Let's go.
[473:17.67]Bingo.
[473:18.27]Sell the weed.
[473:21.61]Stream ends in T-5 minutes.
[473:23.55]Oh, the countdown just started.
[473:26.72]Let's go.
[473:43.94]Got it.
[473:48.47]Dude, why am I glued to this?
[473:53.05]I've got it.
[473:53.77]I'm like holding it in the air.
[474:14.14]Here we go.
[474:23.17]It's turning into nightfall.
[474:30.26]It's time to sell this.
[474:34.14]And then I will be done.
[474:38.36]The game can end and I'll see you in a few days.
[474:40.58]Or this weekend.
[474:48.61]What's today?
[474:49.11]Wednesday?
[474:49.45]Thursday?
[474:51.81]Saturday?
[474:53.03]Sunday?
[474:55.67]Saturday?
[474:55.95]Yeah, I'll see you Saturday.
[475:08.90]Turn the fucking lights off.
[475:10.47]Turn the fucking lights off.
[475:11.91]What lights?
[475:13.39]Like in my room?
[475:21.78]Whenever XQC plays a scary game, everyone just spams lights off with a mad face.
[475:28.69]And then he goes and turns them off.
[475:32.93]I love it.
[475:44.14]Where is everybody?
[475:45.78]What time is it?
[476:00.80]Here we go.
[476:04.84]Lights off.
[476:05.60]Lights off.
[476:06.10]I think he comes back and sits down.
[476:25.11]Alright, it's nightfall.
[476:25.79]Where is everybody?
[476:35.27]I'm not gonna die, right?
[476:36.09]Do you have any maple syrup over here?
[476:56.21]Where is everybody?
[476:57.01]I'm just trying to sell one pack of weed.
[477:09.29]30 seconds until the stream ends?
[477:13.26]I need to drink something.
[477:16.44]Maybe they'll spawn if I turn around and come back.
[477:18.08]It's too early?
[477:19.92]It's sundown, right?
[477:21.74]It's only 7pm.
[477:24.10]What time do they come out?
[477:31.17]Alright, here we go.
[477:31.93]Now it's nightfall.
[477:40.71]Are they actually not here?
[477:41.61]Shit.
[477:55.87]I need to eat or drink something right now, or I'm going to die.
[478:01.35]Snack Shack still open?
[478:05.71]Please still be open.
[478:08.43]Thank God.
[478:10.87]You don't have... You don't have maple syrup here.
[478:15.57]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[478:17.83]You do over here at the gas station.
[478:18.89]Is the gas station closed?
[478:24.49]Please be open.
[478:28.47]Oh, my God.
[478:32.63]I'm gonna die.
[478:39.69]I'm dead.
[478:47.83]Please, before I die, just sell this one weed.
[478:50.19]Okay, it's literally nighttime.
[478:53.19]It is nighttime.
[478:54.35]Crickets are chirping.
[478:55.39]I can hear crickets.
[478:57.15]Where are they?
[479:04.54]Crickets are chirping literally.
[479:17.48]I'm going to die.
[479:18.14]Okay.
[479:20.51]I'm done.
[479:21.17]I'm done.
[479:21.45]I'm done.
[479:53.09]Thanks for watching.
[479:56.63]Did you sell a single weed?
[479:57.73]No, I died.
[479:58.35]I died.
[480:01.37]Apparently, they don't start street racing.
[480:04.19]I don't know when they start.
[480:05.18]It just said nighttime.
[480:06.26]I don't know.
[480:08.22]Nighttime?
[480:08.70]Is that 7, 8, 9, 10 o'clock?
[480:09.62]It was 7, 8, 9!
[480:20.83]Good night, guys.
[480:21.17]I'll see you later.
[480:22.19]This was a wild one.
[480:22.85]It was a lot of fun, though.
[480:24.71]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[480:25.73]We're going to do Iron Lung.
[480:33.51]Thanks for putting up with my bullshit, as always.
[480:36.35]I'll see you guys soon.
[480:37.84]Take care of yourselves.
[480:39.24]Have a great night.
[480:45.10]Make sure you get some good sleep.
[480:47.50]Eat some good food.
[480:49.96]Call your mother.
[480:51.62]You know.
[480:56.65]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[481:03.89]And thanks for the subs too.
[481:05.55]Obviously.
[481:18.15]I got class in four hours.
[481:19.36]Oh, I hope you get some sleep.
[481:23.34]Yeah, Saturday at 4 o'clock Pacific.
[481:29.14]I gotta go figure out what I'm gonna do for food.
[481:32.79]I made curry earlier while watching.
[481:35.43]I'm very jealous.
[481:38.25]That sounds incredible.
[481:41.93]Yeah, goodnight guys.
[481:42.56]See you later.
[481:56.98]you
