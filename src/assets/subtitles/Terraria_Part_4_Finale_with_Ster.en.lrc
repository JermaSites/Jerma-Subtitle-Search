[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.63]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:07.18]Jerma here with a Terraria gameplay.
[00:12.60]Hi!
[00:15.34]We're going to finish Terraria tonight, today.
[00:21.56]Knew that was coming.
[00:22.41]Yeah, I'm pretty predictable.
[00:24.77]I'm gonna finish Terraria, at least the base game, Star and I. This might be a shorter stream.
[00:32.17]I wouldn't lock yourself in like the last couple streams for eight hours or so.
[00:36.55]We're gonna finish the game, chill, and see what happens after that.
[00:41.03]We'll see.
[00:42.82]I will give an update on the activity book, which has been pushed, because obviously I wanted more time for people to do stuff.
[00:48.46]We'll talk about that after Terraria.
[00:52.78]Gonna be a chill stream.
[00:55.41]I think he's trying to talk to me, but I told him I do a full five-minute broadcaster intro.
[01:04.31]I can see the thing lighting up on Discord.
[01:09.67]He's trying to talk to me.
[01:14.31]What is it?
[01:17.57]I saw your thing lighten up.
[01:18.81]I thought you were trying to get a hold of me.
[01:20.88]Oh no, I was talking to the people and telling them that it feels like I threw my left arm out.
[01:27.39]But I haven't used my left arm for like a year, so I don't know what's wrong with it.
[01:30.95]Did you sleep on it wrong?
[01:31.67]And you told me to take some glycycerols.
[01:34.49]That's not what I said.
[01:35.37]Hypo-glyce- glycycerin?
[01:40.34]No, that's not correct.
[01:41.86]That's incorrect.
[01:43.84]What did you tell me?
[01:44.84]I told you.
[01:46.16]Glucosaminocondroitin.
[01:49.12]Oh, what does that do?
[01:50.36]Where do I get it?
[01:52.50]You get it anywhere.
[01:54.18]It's good for your joints.
[01:56.62]It's good for your cartilage.
[01:58.70]Oh, it's not even that.
[01:59.92]My chat's telling me it's cancer.
[02:03.49]I don't think... I would just always take care of your health.
[02:06.81]It's important.
[02:09.37]And for your health.
[02:14.20]But we're going to beat this game.
[02:16.98]Are we?
[02:18.46]Yeah.
[02:19.38]Didn't you tell me this is going to be like... Are you stuck in the room?
[02:22.98]No, I'm doing my intro.
[02:25.24]No, you're stuck in the room.
[02:26.62]What do you mean, stuck in the room?
[02:28.16]You're stuck in the room.
[02:30.24]You'll know when you get to the game.
[02:31.84]I'm in the game.
[02:34.71]You're stuck in the room.
[02:36.07]How do I get in here?
[02:39.75]I don't know.
[02:41.63]Well, I know how to get up.
[02:45.39]You would destroy that house for your own gain.
[02:47.95]You're free.
[02:48.57]You're free.
[02:48.95]Get out quick.
[02:50.19]This is your chance to get out.
[02:53.91]He's a fucking monster.
[02:54.97]Get out quick.
[02:57.61]I tried.
[03:00.21]Yeah, that's why I cut their ears off.
[03:03.51]You're a sick fuck.
[03:04.69]Alright.
[03:04.97]So where do we go from here?
[03:08.15]What was the last thing we did like three years ago?
[03:10.62]Where are we?
[03:11.88]I don't know.
[03:12.28]Last thing I remember is you built an entire teleporting around town tunnel system.
[03:18.60]Hey, welcome to episode number 74 of Let's Play Terraria.
[03:22.53]I built these teleporter pads, you know, to give us a little bit of an easier time getting around.
[03:25.61]You just stand on top of the teleporter and you right click the switch.
[03:29.39]Hey, look, and we're at the dungeon.
[03:30.65]This is actually the next boss we... Oh.
[03:32.73]Nice.
[03:34.78]So I helped with this, if anyone was curious.
[03:37.42]Oh yeah, Jerma did this one.
[03:40.08]He gets full credit.
[03:41.32]I was up, I was about placement.
[03:43.08]I was saying, hey, we should probably put them in different places.
[03:45.50]I looked up some stuff about Terraria.
[03:46.80]I wanted to be prepared for this stream.
[03:47.90]So I said, some of the teleporters should be in front of the new bosses.
[03:51.16]Some should be in other areas that are involved in the plot of the game too.
[03:55.75]So we can see the story play out.
[03:57.37]The plot, yeah, the plot.
[03:59.77]What's the plot so far, just to catch everyone up?
[04:07.73]So, you get dropped off outside.
[04:13.63]Are we gonna fight it?
[04:15.42]We're gonna... And when you get dropped off outside, there's... You have to... There's an island situation, I think.
[04:26.22]Yeah.
[04:27.46]Because this is an island, right?
[04:28.60]I mean, it could be.
[04:30.06]It could be.
[04:31.44]And the whole goal is we're just trying to figure out why we're here and how to get out.
[04:36.54]Yeah, and you have to build the spaceship to get off.
[04:38.42]Yes.
[04:40.28]Because we're about halfway done with the spaceship, but first we need to kill the cultists while the Martians invade.
[04:47.27]Okay.
[04:48.27]Okay, that will make this harder.
[04:52.97]And this is a bust.
[04:54.85]Oh, I remember this.
[04:55.40]Remember when I went... Whoa!
[04:56.64]What the fuck?
[04:57.32]Dude!
[04:57.78]Somebody... Something's happened here!
[04:59.70]Something just happened, man!
[05:06.40]so it's been like three weeks since we last played and you keep asking like oh my god I clicked out of the window you keep asking like when are we done okay well we kill this boss and then there's one more and then we're done so hopefully we can end this stream in 20 minutes because this boss what do you mean ended in 20 minutes I think that's what the fans want oh what's heal I got it h
[05:38.06]I mean, I've played this game before.
[05:39.59]Am I missing him?
[05:41.49]No, your guys are all getting him.
[05:45.89]Alright, he's almost dead.
[05:46.77]28%.
[05:46.89]Oh, I see.
[05:51.16]He's that one.
[05:52.70]Oh, I can feel the DPS.
[05:53.68]3%.
[05:53.70]1%.
[05:58.39]Dots.
[05:58.59]Game's over.
[06:02.80]We didn't just, we just, that's it?
[06:04.66]No, uh, what's your, here, here, here's what, here's what you're gonna look at.
[06:07.81]You press M to go on the map, yeah?
[06:09.71]Uh-huh.
[06:10.73]You see on the, on the, the top of the map, there's these icons for the nebula pillar.
[06:14.83]There's these different pillars.
[06:16.97]Actually, there's one in our base.
[06:18.35]Everyone's dead.
[06:19.27]Again, everyone's dead.
[06:20.92]Huh?
[06:22.54]And our, and our, we go home and everyone will be dead.
[06:26.64]That's just a fact because the pillar spawned on our base.
[06:30.59]Once we destroy all four of those pillars, you immediately fight the final boss, and then we're done.
[06:35.43]That doesn't take, like, a while.
[06:44.11]It could take a very long time to do this.
[06:47.35]You know, got any, like, sidetracking stories and, like, what happened moments we could do while we dig down for an hour and 25 minutes?
[06:54.70]Well, they're supposed to... Oh, actually, the Martians are also at our base.
[06:58.92]Let's take this teleporter.
[07:02.18]If you're ready for like pure chaos.
[07:04.06]Is it going to be pure chaos?
[07:06.30]If you fly higher than like six feet, you'll die.
[07:09.48]What?
[07:10.94]Because of this pillar.
[07:11.84]There's these things that fly around in the sky that don't want you to fly.
[07:18.78]Okay.
[07:26.74]Going good?
[07:27.72]So don't jump in the air?
[07:31.51]You see the worms in the sky?
[07:33.15]They one-shot you if you go too high.
[07:35.23]Oh god, what if I... I don't know what fucking heal is.
[07:45.54]Charma.
[07:46.24]Charma!
[07:47.86]I tried Z, I tried... I rebounded like a month ago and I don't even remember what the fuck I bound it to.
[07:57.19]Oh god, that is over here, isn't it?
[07:58.61]That's scary.
[08:01.78]So... Oh, and the Martians!
[08:08.76]So what do we need to focus on here?
[08:11.23]After you kill, like, I think it's 150 of the solar enemies, then you can destroy the pillar.
[08:17.35]You need to kill 150 enemies?
[08:17.97]Yeah.
[08:24.50]Mage One-Trick the Wizard?
[08:26.28]What the fuck?
[08:28.70]I'm dead.
[08:31.66]Mage One-Trick the Wizard.
[08:34.44]Is One-Trick their nickname?
[08:35.52]I don't know.
[08:37.90]Apparently he's only good at being a mage.
[08:41.22]I mean, that would be good enough for me.
[08:44.46]Get out of here.
[08:45.16]Get out of our base.
[08:56.48]And as soon as we destroy the pillar, like, a UFO is gonna show up.
[09:04.07]I don't even know what's happening.
[09:08.89]I'm at the drive-thru today.
[09:10.47]You'd never believe what happened.
[09:13.01]What happened at this drive-thru?
[09:14.01]I had this dream.
[09:19.07]I had this dream that I was at the drive-thru.
[09:30.63]Just so you get the full Terraria experience, I'll let you pick those up.
[09:34.94]Yeah.
[09:36.26]I'll allow it.
[09:37.04]Pick up what?
[09:38.98]Where the pillar was.
[09:39.80]There's a whole bunch of solar fragments.
[09:41.90]Wow, dude.
[09:43.36]Wow.
[09:43.84]Sure, do they craft some stuff?
[09:45.26]Actually, can't we not do that yet because we don't have the ancient manipulator?
[09:50.85]Well, I mean, to be fair, you did delete a mod or two from the game, so some items don't exist anymore.
[09:56.77]They did.
[10:02.86]I'm getting, like, chunk errors.
[10:07.96]Are you, though?
[10:10.44]Yeah, I am.
[10:11.34]Yeah, fine, I'm picking them up.
[10:17.72]You guys thought that was a joke.
[10:18.70]No, I have, like, errors in my inventory.
[10:26.17]Well, Drummer didn't summon all these Martians.
[10:35.22]Oh, he's playing the fool, I see.
[10:40.30]What the hell is it?
[10:40.90]What is this thing?
[10:49.31]Where does this teleporter go to?
[10:51.91]Which one?
[10:52.25]The one that's like underneath the marshal?
[10:55.35]Alright, there's the saucer.
[11:00.70]Okay, attention span for that teleporter gone.
[11:06.08]One of them goes down to the midway point of all the shitty NPCs, and the other one goes all the way down to hell.
[11:14.09]Oh, you really did, like, do all of that, huh?
[11:16.15]Yeah, and then one of them goes to the jungle, and one of them goes to the dungeon.
[11:21.33]Game's over.
[11:23.88]Not yet.
[11:28.04]Yeah, first we have to kill Naruto, and then Bardo comes for revenge.
[11:32.62]Uh-oh, it's Ufo.
[11:40.14]He's taking a lot of health.
[11:49.56]Watch out for this Ufo.
[11:52.98]I see it.
[12:00.61]Watch out for the UFO!
[12:02.07]Close the door.
[12:05.37]Let my minions do it.
[12:09.27]I wanna fight.
[12:11.10]Alright, where's the UFO?
[12:12.58]Out here by you?
[12:14.60]It's dead.
[12:15.66]Nice work.
[12:17.42]Thanks.
[12:22.30]Also, there's a bunch in the background, so you can shoot those for me.
[12:26.02]All the UFOs in the background?
[12:27.90]Yeah.
[12:32.54]Dude, this is like just... I'm burning so much mana with this weapon.
[12:36.37]I need to get rid of this thing.
[12:37.35]It's good, but... Did you... Did you get the... The Ice Frost Summon Staff that I told you you get?
[12:45.38]When you were a big boy?
[12:47.22]Before the stream started, I was like, Hey, Jarman, you're gonna need to get this.
[12:49.78]It's very good at this stage of the game.
[12:52.32]I've got the Frost Staff on right now.
[13:04.73]Uh-oh.
[13:04.93]Oh, they're all dead.
[13:06.17]No, they're not.
[13:08.29]I thought it was gonna drive by everybody.
[13:09.91]What's not fighting me?
[13:11.01]What's it doing?
[13:11.89]It's over here, hovering around.
[13:13.17]It's trying to shoot me desperately.
[13:16.77]It's dead.
[13:18.25]Alright, we got it.
[13:19.59]Is there gonna be another?
[13:20.33]There's another one.
[13:20.95]There's two.
[13:22.39]This one is smarter.
[13:23.17]It's holding down left mouse button.
[13:24.82]They don't understand.
[13:36.60]Get the car key.
[13:37.64]Yeah, get the car key.
[13:42.17]I gotta listen to that guy, he knows what he's talking about.
[13:44.85]Alright, I got the key.
[13:47.99]Alright, use the car key.
[13:50.51]Do I get to go- wait.
[13:53.13]You telling me I get to fly?
[13:54.11]You get to fly.
[13:56.54]In a... a car.
[13:58.40]You stole an UFO.
[14:02.24]Wow, hold on.
[14:03.58]Once this is done, I'm... Wait, he just spawned right on top of us.
[14:25.18]Whoa!
[14:25.92]He just one-hit killed me with that!
[14:27.98]Yeah, that does a lot of damage.
[14:31.47]Now you know.
[14:31.89]It's for next time, right?
[14:35.43]For next time.
[14:36.47]Yeah, because we're starting a new run, right?
[14:39.17]It's been a while since we last played, so I think it's just better off we start from the beginning.
[14:42.19]I have 380 health.
[14:49.56]Oh, yeah.
[14:50.54]In the storage, there's life fruits, and you should be able to get to 400.
[14:54.92]I don't remember, because I took off the mod...
[14:57.49]I feel like I'm dying really quickly.
[15:00.80]How did I just click out of the window?
[15:02.30]Why is that possible?
[15:08.04]I feel like I'm getting hit, and it takes me like two hits to die here.
[15:15.47]That shouldn't be happening, right?
[15:16.39]I don't know.
[15:18.09]We do have summoner armor, so maybe.
[15:23.25]That kinda is what happens.
[15:24.51]It's unfortunate.
[15:26.57]But my summons are so cool.
[15:30.26]That it's worth it.
[15:36.35]There's so much random shit on the ground.
[15:37.69]I don't know what any of this does, but I'm gonna get it, I guess.
[15:51.59]the uh there's like use use your ufo okay well hold on are we safe or where's that car key okay cosmic car key summons a rideable ufo yeah use your ufo I'm gonna keep saying it until you laugh so like just laugh and get it over with oh and what a nice ufo wow does this last forever
[16:21.96]Yeah.
[16:22.64]Really?
[16:22.98]Yeah.
[16:25.95]So I just get to be Bowser the rest of the game.
[16:29.65]This is great.
[16:30.33]Alright, I'm never taking this off.
[16:32.21]You can't drop any Koopas though.
[16:34.39]That's alright.
[16:37.29]I'm never coming out of this seat.
[16:39.92]I'm gonna be like fucking Krang for the remaining time we play this game.
[16:44.60]Alright, what about your old?
[16:51.31]Okay, so it's in the mount slot.
[16:54.59]What is a blessed apple?
[16:56.63]Unicorn.
[16:59.11]It's not a UFO, so who cares?
[17:01.29]That's true.
[17:02.35]Alright, this is important, though.
[17:03.59]There's a lot of... There's so many things that are overwhelming my brain.
[17:07.29]Alright.
[17:08.37]I'm gonna get... Um... What is the staff?
[17:16.05]Anti-gravity?
[17:16.85]Anti-gravity hook?
[17:18.23]Does that ring a bell?
[17:18.83]Oh.
[17:21.00]Anti-gravity hook.
[17:22.22]I think it's just a hook.
[17:23.22]Is it a cool hook?
[17:24.06]Is it better than what I think I have?
[17:26.18]The one I think I have?
[17:27.22]I don't know what I think you have.
[17:33.46]Come on, I can't get in here.
[17:37.90]Bullshit.
[17:41.31]Alright, let me do this.
[17:43.85]Where's Mr. Crap?
[17:44.47]The Jerma has finished telling the dream?
[17:46.47]What dream?
[17:47.15]I don't even remember you saying there was a dream.
[17:50.73]Alpha Ray.
[17:52.95]And two Wingmen.
[17:56.33]Fifteen Dark Sun Fragments.
[17:58.54]A Genesis.
[18:00.06]And a Galactica Singularity.
[18:06.06]Yeah?
[18:07.62]Damn it.
[18:08.40]I can't do that.
[18:08.98]I already told the dream story.
[18:11.70]I told the whole... I had like three... I had a full dream thing like two days ago.
[18:15.81]I already told it.
[18:19.17]Oh.
[18:19.53]I was doing a- I was, like, running, like, the- previously on Jerma985, like, two or three streams ago.
[18:24.82]Alright, let me... do the thing that I always do, and that is... I don't care.
[18:36.06]Tell Dreamer Riot.
[18:38.12]I'm sorry, I have to- I just- that's what I do, I deposit all.
[18:42.62]I mean, at this point- At this point, who gives a shit?
[18:45.30]Does it matter?
[18:45.72]It doesn't matter.
[18:46.24]It doesn't fucking matter.
[18:46.89]And I gotta say-
[18:49.03]I told you I played through a game with Ashley, and she really wasn't better than you about sticking random shit.
[18:55.76]Right?
[18:56.14]In the storage.
[18:56.72]I thought she knew better, and yet we had like 40 slots filled with banners.
[19:03.38]Look, we don't know what's good and not good.
[19:07.56]We just want to make sure that we have everything.
[19:10.82]We have it all.
[19:15.60]Alright, did anything... What was I trying to do?
[19:20.36]I was trying to make something.
[19:23.12]I'm trying to make something.
[19:24.80]For... Summons the legendary Valifor to assault enemies and blow them away.
[19:31.33]You're gonna want the legendary Valifor.
[19:34.71]What the fuck is Valifor?
[19:37.09]What the fuck?
[19:37.97]I didn't know I had this guy.
[19:39.05]Yeah, it's a Pokémon.
[19:41.17]I think I gave that to you.
[19:43.35]Why can I... Come on, I'm a summoner.
[19:45.19]Why can I not have, like, five of these?
[19:47.64]I think it's only one for that one item.
[19:49.46]I told you to get the ice frost thing from this guy.
[19:52.69]Look.
[19:56.55]Permafrost.
[19:57.21]Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[19:59.31]Get the ice frost.
[20:01.05]Cryogenic frost.
[20:04.77]Cryogenic staff.
[20:05.67]I need some money.
[20:06.47]I got plenty of that in here.
[20:08.75]There's like 20 platinum in there.
[20:13.28]Okay.
[20:14.18]Is this better than my...
[20:17.48]Is this better than my, like, Lovecraftian guys?
[20:21.60]Summons an animated ice monster to protect you.
[20:23.36]Fire it and... Why do I know... Why do I want this?
[20:28.22]Annoying cryogenic stuff.
[20:29.83]Yeah.
[20:32.39]So I have to reroll this, because it sucks.
[20:42.51]Alright.
[20:43.77]Okay, so whenever you wanna... Whenever you wanna beat the game, let me know.
[20:48.55]hurtful cryogenic staff.
[20:51.76]Let's go.
[20:52.74]Fuck, I said I wasn't going to make that a thing on the channel, and it's like too late.
[21:00.28]So what the fuck is this?
[21:02.55]This is not a summon, it's a sentry.
[21:09.65]I like all this stuff, this is cool.
[21:11.07]This thing takes too much mana, I don't like it.
[21:14.32]I'll like have to switch to it randomly.
[21:18.07]I do like this thing, though.
[21:19.07]Alright.
[21:20.39]I'm ready to do whatever you want to do.
[21:26.52]I know.
[21:26.78]Let me get all my summons.
[21:32.04]And let's replace this with this.
[21:37.06]Then that could go bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[21:39.94]Okay, bing.
[21:40.90]Alright.
[21:42.26]What do I got for potions?
[21:43.04]32, 14.
[21:43.46]Oh, where's the...
[21:49.24]You said there was something to heal me, to give me more health or something?
[21:55.61]More max health, you said there was something in the inventory?
[22:02.91]Oh, I pressed the letter L, so I muted, I'm sorry.
[22:07.63]What's in the inventory?
[22:10.61]What?
[22:11.75]You said there was something in the inventory?
[22:14.80]I said there was something in the inventory.
[22:17.08]Max health?
[22:17.64]Oh, lifefruits.
[22:20.15]life fruit so I just take all this I can just take all these you say I'm gonna take them all I'm eating all fruit is that alright with you oh yeah oh yeah use them ah why is it not working don't throw it oh yeah good job
[22:52.08]Way to go.
[22:52.68]Take one first.
[22:54.60]You're looking healthier already, buddy.
[22:56.52]You muted again.
[22:58.56]How is that possible?
[22:59.30]I didn't press L. Well, you know what?
[23:01.56]You know, if you don't want to talk to me, that's fine.
[23:03.40]I need to have 400 health to be able to eat these.
[23:09.33]Oh, you need life crystals?
[23:11.81]I think because I turned off the other goofy thing.
[23:13.83]You turned off the mod.
[23:15.03]See?
[23:15.55]Okay, there's 23 life crystals in here.
[23:18.77]You've got it.
[23:20.23]Yep.
[23:22.14]Oh, it's because I'm pressing L. Yeah, I'm pressing L for life crystal.
[23:30.95]That's funny.
[23:32.33]Alright, so take these.
[23:35.09]Now I'm at 400, can I... Alright, now take these.
[23:40.45]There we go, that's better.
[23:41.29]That's what I'm talking about there.
[23:44.08]I'm good.
[23:45.62]I'm ready to go.
[23:46.82]Ready to go beat the game?
[23:48.50]I'm ready to go beat the game, that's it?
[23:50.87]Okay, on the map, let's... Hey, hey, let's use the new teleporter system.
[23:56.56]Wait, I want potions.
[23:58.10]Where's the potion guy?
[24:01.48]Is the potion guy dead?
[24:13.19]Is it Howard?
[24:16.59]It's Howard, right?
[24:17.41]No.
[24:22.13]I don't think the potion guy's alive hold on I think there's a different one because I got a better potion mod but I think he's like way downstairs oh did you move somebody getting to the bottom of this
[24:43.95]You made all these teleporters on my instructions, of course, but you made these teleporters, and I don't think you remember what you did.
[24:57.35]You talking shit?
[24:59.17]Yeah.
[24:59.57]Alright, I'll just delete the teleporter.
[25:03.61]He thinks he's at the end.
[25:05.07]Oh, megalo.
[25:09.71]You think we care if we're at the end or not.
[25:14.11]I didn't talk about it, but it's, like, funny.
[25:16.81]So, like, a few weeks ago, when we were trying to figure out, like, hey, when do you want to do this again?
[25:22.15]You had already played through, like, a full nother time, like, on Expert.
[25:26.38]Yep, me and Ashley, we had a hankering for some more Terraria, and we played on Revengeance, Expert, and beat, like, the whole thing.
[25:36.68]And then, like, that same week, you were supposed to play Terraria with me on, like, baby mode, and you were like, do you still, like, want to do this?
[25:44.37]And I'm like, yeah!
[25:45.71]You're like, you sure?
[25:46.35]Like, you don't want to, like, get, like, not sick of that or anything?
[25:48.41]And I'm like, no, I like this game.
[25:49.59]It's fun.
[25:54.59]Well, you know what?
[26:03.90]Yeah, I don't know if the NPC spawned in yet with the potion.
[26:06.92]This is good, because I can't die.
[26:09.56]I can no longer die from fall damage.
[26:11.06]So, we don't have potions.
[26:12.28]Whatever.
[26:14.08]Screw it.
[26:17.88]Let's go.
[26:20.16]Have you ever played Super Mario RPG?
[26:24.11]A long time ago.
[26:25.29]Let's frame it tomorrow.
[26:27.75]Oh, that teleporter goes right to the other one.
[26:29.75]Dude, I planned this so well.
[26:32.25]Whoa.
[26:37.79]What a god.
[26:40.03]He knew.
[26:41.04]What is this thing here?
[26:41.98]Isn't that a pillar?
[26:43.52]Yeah, there's four of them.
[26:51.66]I'll have you know throughout our entire Terraria playthrough where me and Ashley beat the game together, most boss fights, we quote it, a classic drama quote, isn't building this platform cheating?
[27:05.37]What do you mean?
[27:06.41]What is that?
[27:06.85]What do you mean, classic?
[27:07.97]That's the one thing I took away from us playing together, is that building platforms to fight bosses is cheating.
[27:13.82]I didn't know.
[27:14.30]Actually, I think you would really think it was funny, the one thing that we built.
[27:18.74]You remember the giant mech head?
[27:21.72]The skeleton head with the big arms swinging around?
[27:23.88]Mm-hmm.
[27:25.86]We made a giant railroad in the sky that goes in a diamond, and it goes too fast, so he can't catch you, and he just stays in the middle spinning.
[27:36.79]And actually, he had so much defense, we could only do one damage to him, so we AFK'd.
[27:41.27]Until it was dead for like 30 minutes.
[27:43.47]That's so stupid.
[27:51.81]Why am I fighting Ice with Ice?
[27:53.09]Isn't that a mistake?
[27:54.61]I don't know.
[27:56.97]Yeah, I think you're healing them.
[28:01.73]I love being Bowser.
[28:02.79]This is great.
[28:03.69]I would have died like three times by now.
[28:15.87]Don't kill me.
[28:16.49]Come on.
[28:16.87]Dude, heal.
[28:18.91]What's the heal button?
[28:19.53]Press L. I do.
[28:20.67]I just get hurt.
[28:21.21]I get killed so... I get hurt.
[28:23.27]When anything touches me, it does like six hearts.
[28:28.07]Maybe you should get armor.
[28:30.71]This is your doing.
[28:31.97]You said be the summoner so I can have constant DPS because I don't trust you.
[28:36.98]You can focus on dodging because you don't have to attack.
[28:40.86]David, I want to attack.
[28:43.65]Just dodge.
[28:50.06]Just dodge.
[28:50.78]I died.
[28:53.40]You can just always use that teleporter to get right back.
[28:58.48]Which teleporter was it?
[28:59.37]I forget.
[29:00.75]The one on the roof.
[29:20.49]I get confused if my enemies are not projectiles or if they're my projectiles.
[29:27.73]Whose projectiles are who?
[29:29.75]It's almost over.
[29:33.19]You can go back to your Mario RPG.
[29:42.50]How many times do you jump on an enemy's head before they die?
[29:46.41]You know you do the chain combo jumps when you attack?
[29:48.73]You just sit there and like, oh, I hit a 20 chain.
[29:51.13]No.
[29:51.33]And everyone else is doing the sleep chase.
[29:54.77]You like turned the stream on for like five minutes when I was trying to do like the ultra achievement.
[30:00.57]Why do you know that?
[30:01.23]Well, because I said I played it a long time ago.
[30:04.47]Hold on.
[30:06.34]Did you ever do the 100 super jumps in a row?
[30:09.54]I don't think so.
[30:10.28]No.
[30:10.52]Actually, I think I actually didn't play it and I watched my brother play it.
[30:15.05]If I had to guess.
[30:16.03]Yeah, I almost had a meltdown trying to get it.
[30:18.31]I got to, like, 38 without, like, save states.
[30:22.11]You ever play Vagrant Story?
[30:23.85]No.
[30:25.01]Very good game.
[30:26.01]It's the Dark Souls of before Dark Souls was a thing.
[30:28.61]Mm-hmm.
[30:31.07]For the PS1, I would recommend it.
[30:32.91]I mean, you like old games.
[30:34.23]I do.
[30:35.97]It also has the Super Mario RPG mechanic where if you hit and you attack, you know, you can do another attack.
[30:41.49]Timed hits.
[30:42.80]Yeah.
[30:42.92]Mm-hmm.
[30:45.52]Very good.
[30:46.28]Very, very good.
[30:48.58]Cool.
[30:49.32]You know, I'm just going to wait 30 more years for the remaster and then we can all enjoy it.
[30:54.02]Because it's really awkward.
[30:56.20]There's like no sound in the game.
[30:59.09]There's no sound.
[31:00.55]There's sound, but it's like PS1 era and everyone has a square face and there's no actual voiced dialog.
[31:09.33]It's just, everything's really quiet.
[31:11.30]And claustrophobic.
[31:18.52]We're going.
[31:19.84]We're going back to the base.
[31:20.80]We gotta go the other direction for the other pillars.
[31:24.74]How many more pillars are there?
[31:26.58]Two.
[31:29.40]And then after we do the two pillars, we then combine them all.
[31:33.19]Star, I teleported back within the thing and...
[31:45.12]Yeah.
[31:45.86]I can't get out now.
[31:46.52]I'm stuck again.
[31:47.44]I need to rebuild this... Oh, don't worry.
[31:50.68]That person has a clone.
[31:59.18]We just made them meet for the first time.
[32:00.98]And look at this.
[32:01.70]They're like, oh my god, are you me?
[32:03.62]What?
[32:03.82]I was in the prison cell next to you the whole time.
[32:05.78]How long have you been here for?
[32:08.47]God, I've seen maybe two or three years?
[32:12.83]They got a lot to talk about, so I'm okay with that.
[32:15.70]No.
[32:16.20]Unfortunately, they don't count as rooms anymore, and they're both gonna escape.
[32:19.63]Good.
[32:21.07]They'll have their own, like, fuckin' Nickelodeon TV show.
[32:25.27]Alright, you ready?
[32:25.89]They'll be on Cartoon Network.
[32:28.41]Alright, I'm... Yes, I'm ready.
[32:38.18]How about for Moon Lord, like, I don't attack him, I just, like, let you do it?
[32:41.42]No!
[32:41.66]Because that's not fair.
[32:44.63]Easy!
[32:45.07]He jumped!
[32:56.68]I'll play support no I'm gonna do the the technique where I just don't I just run around I just like I just don't try not to get hit actually I think moon lord I think you outrun him with the ufo like very slightly I can't remember I can always build a uh a railroad through space but I think that's cheating
[33:37.67]I'm just trying not to get hit.
[33:40.80]If I get hit three or four times I'm dead.
[33:45.33]like light steel is it life leech in this game oh there's one really dumb accessory that I'm using that thorium adds it's a really easy to get item and it's the best item in every mod I've played uh you take you take like 50 more damage but no you take 25 more damage but under 50 health you have 25 light steel so like as long as you're shooting you don't die
[34:13.92]yeah it's like if you just want to like vegetate whoa whoa get off me it's really the go-to somebody said uh fighting moon lord with ancient ice chunk and they said not like this what is that why is that a bad thing not really they seem to think so
[34:47.86]What?
[34:48.22]Attack.
[35:03.95]Before we do the last pillar, we can actually go do a boss and we'll get you a better summon.
[35:07.93]Uh-oh.
[35:08.77]Oh, what?
[35:09.59]Nostradamus.
[35:11.42]Watch out.
[35:12.40]It's Nostradamus.
[35:14.40]Watch out.
[35:14.94]Alright, I'm going to dodge.
[35:30.14]Some enemies have a debuff that'll disable your UFO.
[35:33.26]This guy might have it.
[35:34.16]I have my summons.
[35:41.00]I'm just trying to avoid it.
[35:42.99]No!
[35:44.09]Oh, please, no!
[35:45.53]Don't kill me!
[35:47.15]They're, like, in the background.
[35:48.61]Thank you.
[35:54.31]They're in the background of my game.
[36:06.55]It's funny, like, I'm pretending I can be hurt.
[36:09.69]It's for the stream.
[36:10.57]Wait, how did I end up this far away from you?
[36:12.64]Oh, God.
[36:15.40]Where's the closest teleporter?
[36:18.72]Uh, you can open the map and teleport to me.
[36:21.63]How?
[36:21.71]Okay, I can be hurt.
[36:23.09]What just happened?
[36:23.85]Uh, M, and then you click on me if you have the potions.
[36:26.75]Why did I end up here, in Funky Town?
[36:35.58]Oh shit.
[36:36.74]I thought I had to go back.
[36:38.06]How did I end up in Funky Town?
[36:41.08]I'm just gonna fucking fly to you.
[36:42.48]I'm coming.
[36:57.68]How am I not gaining me?
[37:02.70]Okay, so you press M, and you open the map, and you teleport to me.
[37:06.16]I don't have the potions.
[37:10.58]Or you teleport to Funky Town.
[37:12.18]I teleported to Funky Town, and that was, like, the checkpoint for me to get over to you.
[37:18.00]What is... There's another one!
[37:19.34]Okay, there's another guy over here.
[37:21.08]There's a... I just... I think I just... I've got bad news for you.
[37:25.35]I'm bringing over the last pillar.
[37:28.51]Uh, the pillar doesn't move.
[37:29.97]Oh.
[37:34.29]Alright, don't kill it.
[37:35.93]I'll be there in like 10 seconds.
[37:40.62]Just dodge, dodge, dodge.
[37:41.62]Don't kill it.
[37:43.54]0.1.
[37:46.36]If I stop shooting, I can take damage.
[37:51.94]Hold on.
[37:52.68]Hey, dude, can you see my fire?
[37:54.14]Am I getting close?
[37:56.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:57.15]You got it, dude.
[37:58.11]That hit it.
[37:58.61]Did I get it?
[38:00.34]yeah what are you kidding me oh my god I'm making a montage just for that I hit it from all the way back here dude that's awesome are you serious that's probably I mean has anyone ever done something like that before are we summoning a boss here are we gonna go this way I'm gonna go fight the um the pillar
[38:27.64]Hold on.
[38:29.14]We can also make... Hold on.
[38:34.42]A lot of things are happening right now.
[38:42.65]Here.
[38:43.31]Now that guy can stop laughing at you because you have a new summon staff.
[38:45.89]See, they left.
[38:46.41]They're gone.
[38:47.74]Oh, that guy left already?
[38:48.78]They're going to find themselves.
[38:50.92]Oh, that's great.
[38:51.94]No, not the guy in chat.
[38:53.62]The two people...
[38:55.68]What two people?
[38:56.96]You don't even... How do you not remember that thing?
[38:58.74]That really weird, fun thing that happened, like, less than five minutes ago?
[39:02.46]The thing you sent me?
[39:03.16]Is... Yes.
[39:06.42]Okay, so, I... Stardust sells death.
[39:10.32]So I'm replacing this.
[39:11.71]Let's check this out.
[39:13.03]Oh, this is the... Oh, this thing that I gave the materials for last time, right?
[39:17.77]What?
[39:18.35]Oh, you have to unsummon your other things.
[39:26.88]And where are they?
[39:28.18]Ice classroom, okay.
[39:36.57]Alright, so I'm just bubble guy now.
[39:38.64]Yeah, now you're bubble guy.
[39:41.69]Yeah, last time we played, I looked up some stuff on the Wikipedia.
[39:45.93]And I said, like, there was some summons that I thought were cool.
[39:48.45]And I was like, what Petyr is doing?
[39:49.45]And I got some off stream.
[39:51.43]And then I was just like, I'm just going to leave them in the box and next time we'll figure it out.
[39:54.45]So, he just made it for me now, just to kind of speed things up.
[39:58.43]Alright, what else did I get?
[40:11.49]Astral Bulwark?
[40:14.24]Ten dollars to kick Yerma from the server.
[40:16.72]It's not enough.
[40:17.78]Ten dollars to kick me from the server?
[40:19.40]You're gonna have to add, like, five zeros.
[40:22.94]Yeah.
[40:25.98]How come all of my donations are to ask Yerma things?
[40:29.82]That's what all mine are, too.
[40:34.15]I don't even... I don't even like this guy.
[40:37.99]Wait, I wasn't muted.
[40:44.90]Alright, so I want something else besides the snowstorm staff.
[40:49.44]Maybe I should just put the zealous thing here.
[40:52.38]And just use that.
[40:53.98]I'm gonna give that a try.
[40:54.96]That sounds like a lot of fun.
[40:58.12]Shut up!
[40:59.62]Shut up!
[41:00.50]What?
[41:01.24]It's in my brain!
[41:03.28]What is in your brain?
[41:03.90]What are you talking about?
[41:10.00]Do you have any metal blobs?
[41:12.32]Metal blobs?
[41:14.08]meld blobs meld blobs what do they look like purple blobs I should have way more of them purple blobs oh wait no that's right you have the thing that's like hey star just wanted to ask you a question you have one of those don't you I do start don't act like he doesn't have a name
[41:42.21]Oh, you have one of those?
[41:44.87]That's very disrespectful.
[41:53.97]I wanna look, what can I make?
[41:54.85]I wanna see what I can do.
[41:56.71]Can I turn this into something?
[41:58.59]Yeah, what can I turn this into?
[41:59.37]Alright, I can make Kevin's Catalyst, which is rogue damage.
[42:03.85]No, this is all melee damage and shit.
[42:14.80]There's actually a lot of things we can make right before the end here, because now we also get Astral Ore.
[42:20.27]You know what Astral Ore gets you?
[42:23.47]What is that?
[42:23.87]Okay, wait.
[42:24.43]First of all, I am going to get potions out of that inventory.
[42:29.42]Inventory?
[42:31.60]Okay.
[42:35.69]I gave you $25, now kick Irma.
[42:37.69]Nah, that's... He said, like, three zeros, wasn't it?
[42:39.97]I mean, that's like... You're gonna have to give Star, like, ten grand.
[42:44.45]To get rid of me.
[42:47.37]Yeah.

[42:59.49]Like, oh, here's $15.
[42:59.81]Wow.
[42:59.89]You're...
[43:04.76]Alright, so, um... I want to do... What did I want to do?
[43:15.89]Potions, right.
[43:18.13]Alright.
[43:18.45]Did you use the life root after you used the things?
[43:20.51]You did all that?
[43:21.17]Yeah, I got 425.
[43:21.59]Okay, I found you.
[43:25.37]Give me one of these.
[43:29.64]Give me...
[43:34.03]No mining potion, no untap potion, no archery potion.
[43:38.65]Don't want it.
[43:40.16]Water walking, night owl, shine.
[43:42.68]All these potions suck.
[43:43.80]What are you putting in here?
[43:44.82]Um, um, um, um, um, um.
[43:49.18]I wish we had a potion person so we could do this.
[43:54.41]You told me that the guy was gone.
[43:57.23]There's a new potion mod guy, but I don't think he showed up yet.
[44:02.38]Excuse me for you adding and deleting mods.
[44:05.52]Fix those rooms.
[44:07.92]Actually, I think there's enough empty ones.
[44:10.96]No, just fine.
[44:11.82]I'll fix it.
[44:13.68]Thank you.
[44:25.39]There's enough.
[44:39.25]Wait, don't be in it.
[44:39.93]Shit.
[44:45.82]Alright, Bubbles, get out of the way.
[44:56.40]Alright, I fixed the room.
[45:05.13]Now, let's go in here.
[45:14.41]I've got my bubbles.
[45:16.63]I wish I had those potions.
[45:18.17]The potions really did help me so much.
[45:21.11]Um, you know, we're just gonna sit around and wait and tell some stories.
[45:28.05]What stories do you have for me?
[45:31.26]Alright.
[45:31.76]My arm, my shoulder really hurts.
[45:33.62]You have any recommend what I could have for this?
[45:35.50]Yes, I do.
[45:36.83]Well, I'm being dead serious now.
[45:39.65]Is it like your like, like rotator cuff?
[45:43.05]Or I don't know what that means.
[45:44.48]Is it your shoulder?
[45:45.86]Is it the like the joint inside your shoulder?
[45:48.50]Is it the muscle?
[45:49.34]Is it?
[45:51.22]How did you sleep last night?
[45:52.56]If it helps, I can also dislocate the shoulder, like, on command.
[45:56.81]You might have something.
[45:57.55]There might be something going.
[45:58.19]You might need to see.
[45:58.85]You might need to get that taken a look at.
[46:02.29]Oh, well, I've been able to do that since I was, like,
[46:06.64]like four years old oh okay still some uh the other kid he dragged me across my porch because we were playing a game and it pulled out of the socket and it hurt a lot but now I can just like pop it out and it's like whatever you you were playing a game yeah and it was what the fuck are you talking about I was playing a game

[46:57.69]Alright.
[47:05.21]Oh, but anyways, um... Now, if you're having, like, joint problems, joint pain, I would see a physician about it.
[47:11.77]But you might consider taking... I can't do that.
[47:13.53]Then you might consider taking some glucosamine chondroitin compound.
[47:19.04]Should help a little bit.
[47:20.58]Okay.
[47:21.60]Yes, I am not a doctor.
[47:22.58]Can you spell that for me?
[47:24.74]It's just like it sounds.

[53:31.69]Do you know what I'm saying?
[53:34.17]Say it again.
[53:34.57]Say, well, I don't know what you said.
[53:40.70]No.
[53:40.78]Okay.
[53:42.38]I am ready to do whatever it is you want to do.
[53:49.88]I'm ready to see the endgame.
[53:53.44]Uh...
[54:01.65]one second okay so this boss is from thorium mod and it's supposed to be fought after moon lord but for some reason they decided like if you die they don't want it to despawn so it's really easy because it just never goes away okay so and um it gives ridiculous absurd items where you don't have to think anymore you just put all the items on nice
[54:29.34]So if you don't want to think, all you got to do is beat like a three-stage boss.
[54:32.77]Okay.
[54:35.73]Was that it?
[54:36.63]The Simon Says that you just put down?
[54:38.23]Only usable at night.
[54:40.71]I think it's about to be night.
[54:42.17]How good are you at Simon Says?
[54:46.05]I'd say I'm... No, Simon.
[54:48.03]Right?
[54:50.03]How good am I at Simon?
[54:52.80]Yeah, the thing with, like, the five lights, and it goes... Oh, red light, green light?
[54:58.45]No.
[54:58.51]Where you have to, like, stop when the person says red light?
[55:00.57]No, you have to listen.
[55:02.15]Okay.
[55:03.61]And then you put your thumb up.
[55:08.61]You have to match it.
[55:11.37]I win, okay?
[55:12.01]So I'm pretty good.
[55:12.83]Okay, fine.
[55:13.94]You think you're so fucking hot?
[55:14.96]Here we go.
[55:15.36]Okay.
[55:23.13]It's getting harder It's getting harder Not bad you got it
[55:54.41]Somebody's a little smarter than I thought.
[55:55.63]I mean... Alright, close.
[56:11.89]That was it?
[56:13.04]Let's go.
[56:14.72]I win.
[56:15.50]I messed him up, but I win.
[56:17.04]No, you ripped the batteries out of the machine.
[56:18.76]That doesn't count.
[56:19.48]Oh, come on.
[56:20.18]Oh, come on.
[56:21.63]He's broken.
[56:22.77]It's broken.
[56:23.35]I think it's broken.
[56:24.95]What's going on?
[56:25.45]I think it's broken.
[56:26.61]I told you.
[56:27.11]You broke it.
[56:27.67]You pulled the batteries.
[56:28.65]You can't pull the batteries out.
[56:32.36]Where'd you go?
[56:36.42]Do you just have, like, a notepad full of, like, time fillers that you can do in any game?
[56:41.79]Like, just in case something goes awry, I gotta fill some time here.
[56:49.02]Yeah.
[56:50.20]Yeah.
[56:50.64]You're very good at it.
[56:53.18]I'll give you that.
[56:57.92]Okay, when's nighttime?
[56:59.62]Is it 6 p.m., guys?
[57:00.84]Is that when Mom calls you in for dinner?
[57:02.22]I don't know.
[57:02.52]That's not on my notepad.
[57:03.82]I only know what's written down on my second monitor.
[57:06.58]Okay, well, what's next on the script?
[57:09.70]Wouldn't you like to know?
[57:11.06]Magician never gives away his script.
[57:14.42]Okay.
[57:17.70]Okay, Ma says we can stay out until 7.30.
[57:19.08]It's 5.43 p.m.
[57:19.34]right now.
[57:27.44]You mean secrets.
[57:28.66]That's a script.
[57:38.75]I'm going to just lock somebody here.
[57:43.95]What are we doing?
[57:45.27]We're waiting for night time.
[57:47.02]It's almost night time.
[57:48.12]We've got another hour.
[57:49.88]Time goes by fast.
[57:51.64]Not a real hour.
[57:56.32]There's items to, like, switch it to Knight, but I can't remember.
[57:58.86]What are your computer specs?
[58:00.88]I don't know.
[58:02.82]I got a Dell.
[58:04.98]I have a Gateway PC.
[58:08.24]You know, those, like, $245 cow machines?
[58:14.87]They didn't even come with, like, a fucking CPU.
[58:17.69]I don't know what's up with our health.
[58:18.75]I don't know why I have 540.
[58:19.85]I don't know what happened.
[58:33.50]It is now 7 p.m.
[58:37.89]That's nighttime, right?
[58:40.17]We need it to be 7 p.m.
[58:46.09]TTS, when is sundown?
[58:49.15]Star, sundown is at 7.42 p.m.
[58:51.41]How could we even get in on the WoW Classic thing?
[58:55.20]You have, like, five seconds to answer before, like, an endgame.
[58:58.96]Okay, so... Okay, I already did it.
[59:02.56]Here's your answer.
[59:04.66]That's a really good answer.
[59:05.76]I'm glad that... Alright, here we go.
[59:13.31]Oh my god.
[59:14.03]Alright, pay attention to this.
[59:21.15]You're gonna have to do this back to me.
[59:23.65]It's Simon.
[59:24.21]You're gonna have to do it back to me.
[59:25.55]Okay, okay.
[59:33.10]Just do something!
[59:33.90]I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
[59:37.98]I'll try.
[59:39.22]Was I good?
[59:39.65]Oh, I... I dropped 32 gold.
[59:40.39]I'm sorry.
[59:53.15]32 gold is not a lot.
[59:54.27]It's a lot.
[60:02.87]This stat is not good against enemies that move quickly.
[60:08.79]Oh, these aren't moving fast.
[60:09.81]Kermit, you're getting eaten alive down there.
[60:13.88]I know.
[60:14.32]I can't do it.
[60:19.88]I'm just like...
[60:23.29]I may as well just be walking into the towers.
[60:26.28]I'm surprised you're not writing in chat right now.
[60:28.82]Oh dude, I almost built an adrenaline meter.
[60:35.02]I've almost got revengeance.
[60:40.36]I'm going to stay in here, unless my bubbles just fly around.
[60:47.97]What are you doing over here?
[60:49.67]He's being useless.
[61:02.30]Ooh, that was a pretty good setup there.
[61:13.46]I probably shouldn't go in the air.
[61:15.28]I'm like this faster than me.
[61:23.77]the ufo is a little slow in some spots but this is also I think me and Ashley I I want to build the thing just to show you the stupid circle mine cart that confuses every boss get out of the baby trolley alright oh god
[61:56.22]This is the expert level.
[62:01.08]And you know there's a YouTube video of a guy doing this.
[62:03.77]And his hands are just like around the whole Simon.
[62:08.43]Can they chase you for a second so I can switch my arrows?
[62:10.57]Sure, I'll go like this.
[62:26.99]Thank you.
[62:28.29]I am very pleased.
[62:29.19]I'm very happy to be the rock that you threw to distract the enemy.
[62:36.28]I don't know what you did, but it worked for a second.
[62:39.16]I didn't think it would be possible.
[62:41.96]There's like a ghost in here.
[62:43.52]What is even fucking in here?
[62:45.04]Stop!
[62:45.50]Leave me alone!
[62:46.12]What did it again?
[62:52.50]I spawned... They spawned in here.
[62:59.08]What was that?
[63:00.26]That was like a car accident.
[63:01.66]Is it safe to come back here?
[63:06.27]Don't worry, Jerma.
[63:07.43]It's not much longer.
[63:08.37]There we go.
[63:14.31]There we go.
[63:14.65]There we go.
[63:23.85]I love your one little Pokémon still blowing wind down there.
[63:28.29]I just get hit and die.
[63:32.21]I can't avoid damage.
[63:33.47]I just get hit three times and explode.
[63:41.13]This is really my fault.
[63:44.72]In the past, for like most other streams, I would have prepared you for this.
[63:50.12]But it's like the finish line's right there and my little brother just tripped and it's like I'm looking back but I'm still running forward.
[63:58.38]Did you pick up all that?
[63:59.48]Yeah, and I'm really hurt too.
[64:00.84]No, no, brother, little brother, give me that back.
[64:04.22]Not only did I fall down, I got very seriously injured.
[64:09.76]Oh, there's another phase.
[64:11.08]I don't think it happens in normal.
[64:12.34]My leg is going the other way.
[64:14.62]And you're all just like, ah, okay.
[64:19.74]No, but seriously, drop those.
[64:21.60]All of it?
[64:23.10]Yeah.
[64:24.82]This is a stick-up.
[64:35.89]And then okay, I'll give you what you need We're at the finish line, and I just saw you trip, but I don't care and I didn't prepare Didn't that you're taking one of these didn't that happen like one of these three streams ago by the way I think I've had a broken leg just sitting there Since like we fought the fucking plant boss
[65:00.69]A broken leg?
[65:01.67]Yeah.
[65:03.55]You know, I'm bringing up your, like, running the race joke.
[65:07.23]No, I agree.
[65:08.01]This happened, like, two streams ago.
[65:10.27]We hit Plantera, and I was just like, okay.
[65:13.81]Like, I have a... Oh, fuck, I pressed B for backpack, and I had B for drink all potions.
[65:19.72]Yeah, you did just drink all your potions.
[65:21.44]Ah, my leg!
[65:24.16]Big brother!
[65:26.64]Big brother, my leg!
[65:27.80]Big brother!
[65:29.69]You're gonna have to pick me up.
[65:31.79]Hey, that's for you too.
[65:33.47]What the fuck is this?
[65:34.71]This is like the best item I've ever seen.
[65:37.58]Yeah.
[65:38.06]What is this stuff?
[65:40.62]It's, uh, like I said, that's supposed to be the final boss of Thorium.
[65:46.61]And it's not that hard.
[65:50.21]And it just, it's like, here's the end of the game.
[65:52.35]Here, have some goofy end game items that you can craft immediately.
[65:57.01]And, uh,
[65:58.02]What?
[65:58.76]I can have, like, ten of these?
[66:00.66]Yeah, now you turn into, like, a superhero.
[66:08.18]Wear the armor?
[66:09.36]No.
[66:10.93]Okay.
[66:12.19]Wear the armor.
[66:13.03]I know.
[66:16.29]It also makes you bind a special key that I don't think you have bound.
[66:20.09]You'll have to check in the options if you have it.
[66:23.51]Molten Banner.
[66:26.99]I'm holding this banner.
[66:27.83]What the fuck?
[66:31.77]25%.
[66:32.53]What did I get for this?
[66:33.99]Set bonus.
[66:34.49]Pressing the special ability key will unleash an echo of Slag Fury's power.
[66:40.49]It's like a bonus stationary summon that shoots a million missiles.
[66:43.98]Do I even have... ...a special bond?
[66:51.54]Controls.

[67:34.76]It just like looked No, that's thing right there.
[67:38.28]Oh But there's nothing there's no enemy.
[67:40.99]So it's not shooting.

[68:03.32]Yeah, my big bro killed Ragnarok for me.
[68:06.07]Where'd that guy go?
[68:11.89]What's your favorite 80s comedy movie?
[68:15.97]Ignore the pink blocks.
[68:17.86]80s Ghostbusters.
[68:20.75]That's not a combi.
[68:22.87]Yes, it is.
[68:23.67]Was that 88?
[68:23.91]89?
[68:23.99]Or was that 90?
[68:24.83]Might be 99.
[68:25.19]91, maybe.
[68:26.13]You're debating the wrong thing.
[68:27.19]It's not a combi.
[68:27.83]Yes, it is.
[68:28.67]What are you talking about?
[68:29.33]There's not, like, a single funny thing in that whole booth.
[68:31.32]Every single actor in that was a comedian.
[68:33.16]Wait, wait, hold on.
[68:34.72]What did you just say?
[68:37.10]Quote one funny thing from Ghostbusters.
[68:41.34]What the hell are you doing?
[68:46.71]Okay, I just did that one.
[68:47.43]Did anyone laugh?
[68:49.52]Were there any lulls in your chat?
[68:58.46]That's an actual quote from that movie, and it's a really funny part of the movie.
[69:03.75]Those who get it will know.
[69:08.17]Okay.
[69:10.71]Are we talking the one where the Ghostbusters are all women?
[69:14.02]Or, like... Classic.

[70:26.87]He's got me!
[70:43.02]Is he dead?
[70:43.48]I think so.
[70:45.32]Oh, no, no.
[70:45.78]He's half.
[70:46.34]Now you gotta shoot his heart.
[70:48.58]Go for the hot.

[70:53.35]Oh, no.
[70:53.63]He's dead.
[70:53.93]Never mind.
[70:55.59]That was rough.
[70:57.85]Hey, give me the freaking Luminite.
[70:59.17]What are you doing, little bro?
[71:01.55]Congratulations.
[71:02.41]You have just beaten the base game of Terraria.
[71:05.02]See you guys later.
[71:06.18]That's it.
[71:06.42]Just kidding.
[71:11.11]What do you want?
[71:11.57]Uh, Luminite.
[71:14.53]Ore.
[71:14.91]Luminite?
[71:16.05]You want one of my huge... Never mind.
[71:19.40]Luminite Ore.
[71:20.84]Celestial Onion.
[71:22.66]What does it look like?
[71:23.84]Shadow Diamond.
[71:26.44]Here, I'm gonna give you... I'm gonna give you a hundred beats.
[71:30.41]Um, where is it?
[71:31.41]Luminite Ore.
[71:37.86]What does it look like?
[71:39.45]Is it a portal gun?
[71:41.09]It's ore, so it looks like a little blob.
[71:44.07]Yeah, there's a portal gun.
[71:44.83]I don't think I have any of this shit.
[71:52.41]I mean, you keep little brothering and picking it all up.
[71:55.42]Yeah, but this doesn't look like ore.
[71:57.22]This looks like trash.
[72:00.40]Oh, thank you.
[72:01.64]Thank you for giving me the trash.
[72:03.24]Okay, so what's gonna happen now, I guess, is, like, you can tell funny stories, and I'm gonna, like, speedrun the post-Moon Lord content.
[72:10.39]No, what?
[72:14.79]This is cool.
[72:19.80]Quick, do the thing.
[72:20.60]Hold on, I gotta do the thing.
[72:21.32]I gotta do the thing.
[72:22.74]Wait.
[72:31.06]No, hold on.
[72:46.29]Is he doing something funny?
[72:48.97]Yeah, I'm doing the thing that you do with the portal gun in the first, like, 40 minutes of Portal.
[72:53.21]You figure out you can do that.
[72:56.15]Alright, so you're gonna- you're gonna speedrun the rest of the game.
[72:58.82]yeah I'm like I'm just I'm not gonna clue you in but I'm just gonna teleport to you okay I'm just gonna buy wormhole potions and then teleport to you oh there's the there's the original music it's been his journey
[73:29.40]Why are there snowmen with guns up here?
[73:32.42]Snowmen gangsters?
[73:34.58]Because I saw them.
[73:36.20]What?
[73:36.64]It was in my inventory, so I had to get rid of it.
[73:40.54]They're dead.
[73:41.02]Oh, did I... Oh, that's awesome.
[73:47.99]That's such a cool enemy.
[73:49.79]Okay.
[73:50.77]I'm gonna buy some pots.
[73:52.69]Then I'm coming to you.
[73:57.40]Do they sell wormhole potions, or do I just have to make them, right?
[74:00.02]Do we have any?
[74:02.54]You can buy them from Lucy, but you have to set it to store one.
[74:11.85]So when you talk to her, she says, which shop?
[74:14.41]You need it to be classic.
[74:16.57]Like, wow classic, you know what I'm saying?
[74:18.25]Vanilla.
[74:18.71]You're gonna love them down right now, buddy.
[74:23.36]Uh, okay.
[74:24.21]That's weird, I guess.
[74:26.49]Um, strangely enough, I don't know what you mean by that.
[74:29.01]Uh, Reese's.
[74:31.13]Alright.
[74:32.75]How do you eat it?
[74:34.03]Who cares?
[74:34.61]Um, okay.
[74:37.37]You sound like someone, but who do you sound like?
[74:42.56]Who was that?
[74:44.12]I should know that.
[74:44.70]That was Will Arnett, the Reese's commercial.
[74:47.08]I thought you guys would have known what that was.
[74:50.60]Oh, okay.
[74:55.60]I would make, I would make Quasar's Flare.
[74:58.90]It's very good.
[74:59.92]But I gave my Daedalus Stormbow to my other character.
[75:02.80]Where the fuck is this Wormhole Potion?
[75:05.26]Because I didn't play for three weeks.
[75:07.22]I don't have one right now.
[75:08.83]$50 just came in right out.
[75:10.13]$50!
[75:12.33]Thanks for the $50, AV Joe, and this is for Star.
[75:15.65]Hey, please tell, uh, hey, Sturmdel, please tell Jar that he's doing a good job.
[75:20.77]Glad to see you playing one of my favorite games.
[75:22.09]Will you be playing it again when they release Minigolf?
[75:26.10]Is that real?
[75:27.46]I will.
[75:29.20]I don't know if I'll stream it, but I'll probably play that.
[75:32.18]Oh, yeah.
[75:32.52]Yeah.
[75:33.58]The answer for me is no.
[75:35.90]Make sure you catch Star Stream.
[75:38.25]You said... Alright.
[75:43.01]Hold on.
[75:43.95]Shop Changer, you said Vanilla, right?
[75:47.39]Yeah.
[75:48.91]On Lucy.
[75:49.69]And what color is the Wurmple Potion?
[75:53.73]Blue?
[75:54.63]Blue.
[75:55.63]Water walking.
[75:57.21]Feather fall.
[75:58.31]Why is there a Triceratops in here?
[76:00.40]Is there?
[76:05.58]I'm looking for the Triceratops.
[76:07.53]Calming?
[76:09.05]Mining?
[76:22.55]Uh, is that me?
[76:24.65]I don't know what that was.
[76:25.92]Okay.
[76:32.60]Invisibility, gills, flipper, hunter.
[76:36.00]Uh, I have no idea what that is.
[76:40.80]It sounds like I live... I'll be right back.
[76:45.38]Is that thunder?
[76:46.52]It sounds like an airplane in my house.
[76:50.81]Yeah, go take a BRB, see what's going on there.
[76:55.58]That sounded like there was, like, thunder.
[76:56.74]I don't think it's on here.
[77:09.61]Yeah, I think it's, uh... AC-130 inbound.
[77:13.51]Uh, excuse me.
[77:14.43]AC-130 inbound.
[77:14.77]Yeah, you've got a UAV.
[77:20.69]Alright, this is way more important.
[77:22.59]Where is this potion?
[77:24.77]Which, oh my god, am I going to have to like... It's not on Vanille.
[77:29.77]Wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, worm, worm, worm, worm, worm, worm.
[77:36.29]Oh, you're right.
[77:40.20]Do you see in the underneath way at the bottom, bottom left, the like bottom, bottom NPC, Severus the Alchemist?
[77:48.20]He has...
[78:03.70]He's all the way down there.
[78:04.84]You have to make a Fullmetal Alchemist reference.
[78:10.28]I'm not short!
[78:12.25]No, I was gonna just scream.
[78:12.91]That was funny for 20 episodes.
[78:14.49]I was gonna scream, Al!
[78:17.23]But then I don't think I could do it.
[78:19.75]What was this guy's name?
[78:22.17]Severus, the alchemist.
[78:23.79]Found him.
[78:28.65]Hey, there they are.
[78:32.49]Good.
[78:36.82]Here.
[78:37.82]He can have this.
[78:38.40]Alright.
[78:45.46]I'm ready.
[78:45.92]I'm not short.
[78:47.02]You're short.
[78:47.68]I like you just call me short.
[78:52.91]Very good.
[78:53.53]I'm hiring you.
[78:56.45]That was the test run.
[79:03.28]Elmo.
[79:03.68]Yeah, that was an Elmo.
[79:07.42]Alright, so I'm ready.
[79:11.12]Let's go.
[79:11.58]I'm gonna be able to only do this one more time.
[79:15.92]Deposit all.
[79:18.50]Yeah.
[79:19.20]Nice.
[79:19.60]Alright, so what's the next thing we're gonna do?
[79:20.90]Oh my god, I teleport to you?
[79:22.15]Uh... No.
[79:25.49]Well, I bought ten of these, so... Wow.
[79:29.57]You must be rich.
[79:30.27]You can afford ten of those?
[79:31.95]There's at least five platinum in there, man.
[79:36.32]No, I need to get rid of this stupid thing.
[79:37.70]This thing's causing me an issue.
[79:38.88]Okay.
[79:42.52]Jerma is he having an issue right now that's better now I can do one two three four five six I can do five of those damn what was I doing I need to make the unholy shard what am I doing can I turn this into anything this this staff no this is the ultimate ability
[80:13.56]Can I do something with this?
[80:14.89]No.
[80:18.27]So is there any reason at all to even have a pickaxe at this point?
[80:24.73]Do we need any?
[80:25.89]I made the really good one that we need because there's new ore that one, but I'm not making one.
[80:32.75]Don't worry about it.
[80:35.24]Do I have to activate this or can I just hold it?
[80:36.74]Hold what?
[80:39.22]The big ice cream.
[80:39.86]You have to hold it.
[80:42.82]It very clearly states while held.
[80:45.76]Yeah, but I don't know.
[80:48.32]You don't know what?
[80:50.21]When I click it goes... You don't know what?
[80:52.73]When I click it goes... I didn't know if I had to turn it on or something.
[80:58.05]I don't know.
[80:59.21]Is there any reason for it at all to have Jerma and Star's Terraria speedrun?
[81:04.36]I don't know.
[81:05.10]Is there any reason at all for you to go on a road trip with your friends?
[81:07.86]Or are you just going to go on that road trip by yourself?
[81:22.21]When you click on an enemy with a banner, it makes your minions target an enemy.
[81:24.98]Okay, so there is a point to click.
[81:27.54]I mean, I didn't know.
[81:28.80]Am I supposed to know everything?
[81:30.52]I don't know.
[81:31.16]You're the one with, like, 200 days played in this game.
[81:35.06]I didn't make a summoner ever.
[81:41.11]What, am I just supposed to know these things?
[81:42.79]What the fuck was that?
[81:45.21]Okay.
[81:49.02]That may be a real funny guy.
[81:51.02]So what's the next boss?
[81:53.21]Uh, Profane Guardians, and then we gotta kill the Profane Goddess.
[81:57.35]And we have to kill, um... The Marshmallow Man?
[82:03.49]If I see your sound is muted one more time in this chat, I'm gonna swallow a whole egg.
[82:08.34]Me?
[82:10.34]No, mine.
[82:10.78]What?
[82:11.78]Oh.
[82:15.22]What am I doing?
[82:19.30]where is the thing I'm looking for tell me where it is oh I'm sorry uh celestial hail bomber yeah
[82:47.51]Didn't I make the freaking ankh on this character?
[82:51.09]I did, right?
[82:52.97]Before we played the game, you did mention, I have too many characters, I don't know who is who.
[82:57.67]You did say that.
[82:58.25]Yeah, I don't.
[83:00.54]But I swear, I farmed and made an ankh the last time we stopped playing.
[83:05.36]And I just don't have it?
[83:08.52]Or is this it?
[83:09.70]I don't know.
[83:13.01]No.
[83:15.44]Why does the music keep getting funky?
[83:19.58]Oh, because of the mushroom biome that I made above us.
[83:23.65]That's funk town.
[83:28.05]Wings, I don't feel like making all this stuff.
[83:31.05]Like, I could, but I've already done this.
[83:33.24]Will I?
[83:33.64]I'm just gonna go fight things.
[83:39.24]So you're gonna go fight, we're going, where are you going?
[83:40.98]To the teleporter?
[83:46.63]Oh, he's during the daytime?
[83:47.93]Dude, my God.
[83:49.61]Like, now!
[83:51.99]Now!
[83:52.73]Hey.
[83:53.09]I keep forgetting to sleep in the bed.
[83:55.17]This is awful.
[84:00.58]I really am just a little kid in the car.
[84:02.42]I just have an ice cream in the car.
[84:08.73]I'm getting ready to fight a boss.
[84:09.63]We gotta fight it during the day, so I'm gonna craft the thing that lets me skip the time of day, but I don't remember what I need to craft that thing.
[84:13.94]Let's go!
[84:15.00]Let's go!
[84:16.46]I'm assuming Souls of Night?
[84:25.41]So let me ask you something.
[84:27.35]We've beaten Terraria, the base game.
[84:29.47]Yes.
[84:30.09]What has been your favorite moment from the Star and Jeremy Terraria playthrough?
[84:36.30]I told you.
[84:37.12]What was it?
[84:37.82]It was when you said, isn't this cheating when we were making platforms to fight a boss?
[84:42.46]That's easily my number one takeaway and favorite moment.
[84:48.32]Cool.
[84:48.42]Cool.
[84:50.93]My favorite was learning how to alt-click items to not deposit them after 16 hours.
[85:00.84]Cool.
[85:06.30]Mine would be when for some weird reason you knew the recipe for the day-changing item and you told me how to do it.
[85:13.24]I did?
[85:15.16]No, like, right now, if you told me how to do it, that would be my favorite part.
[85:18.86]How do I do it?
[85:19.48]Guys, how do I do it?
[85:19.96]How do I do it?
[85:20.32]How do I do it?
[85:20.96]How do I do it?
[85:21.48]I'm muted.
[85:21.70]How do I do it?
[85:22.08]How do I do it?
[85:22.44]How do I do it?
[85:22.84]I'm muted.
[85:23.16]How do I do it?
[85:25.38]I'm looking at chat.
[85:26.68]Someone says it's called Cosmolite.
[85:28.86]Like, how the hell does that help?
[85:31.30]If it was me, I would say... I'm going to take a guess here.
[85:34.73]It's Hellstones and Light Souls.
[85:37.27]I don't know.
[85:37.95]That makes sense.
[85:38.87]I'm looking to be held by the hand here.
[85:44.78]Oh, I do have to make moonlight, and then I have to make daylight.
[85:48.50]Moonlight and sunlight, right?
[85:50.30]Three sunstones and 22 of the fire spirits from the moon lord.
[85:54.01]I'm just taking a guess here.
[85:57.33]You're wrong.
[86:05.02]Fuck.
[86:06.62]You guys are trying to fucking get my back in.
[86:15.42]You're not supposed to have my back!
[86:18.65]720 damage.
[86:19.05]Get you baited.
[86:31.81]So where are you off to now?
[86:41.25]I feel like the last, like, 12 minutes of this playthrough has been Star remembers how to summon things.
[86:47.85]There's a lot of things to summon in this game.
[86:49.88]You're going to fight a boss?
[86:51.60]Yeah.
[86:52.38]What the fuck have you not told me this for?
[86:55.56]Alright, let's go.
[87:06.29]Holy shit, this is fun.
[87:11.24]okay I like being able to destroy things and then they drop a profane core which I don't think you can make this like non-consumable but I don't think we need to do pretty sure we'll beat it first time feeling pretty good about that so are we staying are we fighting here yeah we're gonna fight here the things that we just fought are ads for the next boss oh geez okay it's a pretty rough one alright I'm ready
[87:49.56]He's fast.
[87:51.56]He's fast.
[87:52.40]I'm on the ground.
[88:05.46]He's like flying around in the dirt and I can't shoot him because you're up that high.

[88:12.86]My rubber spill.
[88:16.10]My rubber spill with water.
[88:36.71]My little brother showed up and just made it harder.

[90:15.19]Oh, this one has summon damage.
[90:17.16]Summon damage?
[90:19.10]Summon damage.
[90:19.74]Nice.
[90:21.90]Oh, poop.
[90:23.82]You're supposed to fight them in the other area.
[90:25.40]Do you have the other... There are two items up here.
[90:29.29]Oh, shit, dude.
[90:29.69]Then you get the rune of cost.
[90:30.93]Look at this.
[90:31.87]Some say cost them.
[90:34.35]Get those.
[90:37.83]I'll wait for you to get it.
[90:43.28]Divine Geode.
[90:45.80]Okay, I got a Divine Unholy Essence, and a Divine... I keep forgetting to sleep in the bed!
[90:52.62]And you make fun of me for making mistakes.
[90:54.22]Yeah, well, that's because you are a moon.
[91:02.92]Alright, so there's this Divine Geode.
[91:04.74]What can I do with this?
[91:05.28]Let me talk to the guy.
[91:06.76]Uh, I think you can... shove it up your... I don't remember.
[91:12.36]What did you just say?
[91:14.46]what not I didn't say nothing eight defense absorbs 25 of damage with players on your team only active above 25 life okay so it's like you can make armor percent increase damage any summoning stuff what I'm just thinking if there's anything for summoners here with this geode unholy essence let's see what I can do with that
[91:44.96]profaned crucible oh we never fought the ravager and now he's buffed because we killed that boss we had to do the ravager how come you didn't remind me I don't I don't know what that is did you did you get this stupid snowman staff
[92:09.92]Hail Bomber.
[92:10.52]Summons kamikaze snowmen that will blow up upon hitting enemies.
[92:13.34]I mean, that sounds like... Alright, I'll try it.
[92:16.37]Is it a sentry?
[92:19.67]Does it replace my cool thing?
[92:23.77]No, I think they're just spells.
[92:27.97]What?
[92:29.79]Yeah, they have like a duration.
[92:32.13]Oh, okay.
[92:33.21]That's kind of cool.
[92:33.85]Alright, where are you off to now?
[92:39.09]Going to the dungeon.
[92:41.01]Going to the dungeon.
[92:51.95]Why are you going down here?
[92:54.53]There's a boss down here.
[92:55.79]There's a lot of new stuff in the dungeon.
[92:57.55]There's two bosses down here, actually.
[93:04.28]Are you snowman?
[93:05.58]I'm not snowman.
[93:10.00]Never dig straight down.
[93:11.42]I didn't know that.
[93:13.26]What?
[93:13.48]You don't take fall damage.
[93:16.40]Because of lava.
[93:19.16]Oh, I wouldn't see it.
[93:21.60]You are going so fast.
[93:24.00]Holy shit.
[93:30.92]Cool.
[93:36.44]Ow.
[93:40.41]Ow.
[93:44.31]Why are you going that way?
[93:46.47]Uh, I'm clearing space.
[93:51.35]In case one of the bosses show up.
[93:53.53]Oh, hey Jermich, give me a chance later.
[93:55.77]What do you need?
[93:57.05]I need you to just stay here.
[93:58.77]Stay here.
[94:00.22]Yeah.
[94:01.84]I'll be right back.
[94:04.84]For real.
[94:14.81]He's never coming back, is he?
[94:25.84]Why was that not working?
[94:27.22]Okay, I guess this item is dumb.
[94:34.02]Now I gotta go... I am now fully protected.
[94:45.73]Kevin, what the fuck?
[94:48.19]Just kill, okay.
[94:50.37]Are you dying?
[94:50.91]Nope.
[94:53.75]I just got almost insta-killed.
[94:55.45]Why is this guy so bad?
[94:57.87]The guy playing, not the character.
[94:59.35]That's what I mean.
[94:59.99]Alright, I just almost died instantly by like a fireball.
[95:04.72]Should that be happening?
[95:07.98]No.
[95:09.76]I mean, this area is a little bit buff, but no.
[95:21.88]Hell of it.
[95:33.03]You dead?
[95:33.91]Yes.
[95:35.43]Okay.
[95:36.71]I mean, see, that's understandable.
[95:41.33]There's a lot of things going on.
[95:42.55]I just get hit twice and die.
[95:44.37]That's what I've been doing for the last, like, hour and a half.
[95:46.57]Oh, I died.
[95:47.11]Shit.
[95:55.32]That was a big oof.
[95:57.18]You know what they say.
[95:57.94]That was a big oof.
[95:59.56]That's what they say.
[96:00.26]You know what I'm saying?
[96:00.88]They talk about me.
[96:01.46]That was a big oof.
[96:03.32]Stop it.
[96:09.81]Where are you going?
[96:10.33]To the dungeon.
[96:12.01]I gotta pick up all the things.
[96:13.81]Wait, how did you... Gotta go fast.
[96:25.49]Shit, you're like all... I'm just teleporting to you.
[96:28.63]At this point, why would I even... Wait, I'm on my way to get down there.
[96:32.29]I'm gonna be able to get down there when I get here.
[96:36.15]Finally.
[96:36.63]Hey, don't matter how you eat it.
[96:40.65]It's scrum... Okay.
[96:42.35]Okay.
[96:49.30]This is scrumptious.
[96:56.76]So what are you up to now?
[97:02.16]I don't know.
[97:02.50]I picked up, look at all this crap.
[97:04.98]I don't even want this stuff.
[97:06.94]It won't leave me.
[97:07.60]I don't want it.
[97:11.34]There's a boss that summons here, but you have to get like 50 ectoplasms first.
[97:15.51]50 ectoplasms?
[97:16.29]That sounds like a lot of ectoplasms.
[97:18.57]The pink skulls that fly at you, I think, appear after you kill enemies sometimes.
[97:22.83]I don't know.
[97:24.17]And then it's kind of a tough boss, and it might kill me, but I kind of want to fight it.
[97:27.93]Either that, or I can... Oh, hey, you got the portal gun?
[97:31.21]No.
[97:32.65]You don't have the portal gun.
[97:33.53]I deposited that what seems like a decade ago.
[97:37.71]Um...
[97:39.57]go home right now little bro because I need you to get that portal gun for me okay I'm gonna get the portal gun make sure you heal up you know buy your buff potions okay okay what did you need you need the portal gun anything else while I'm here I need the portal gun while you're there bro
[98:05.22]people consider using it during a boss fight cheating do you I don't why is it I don't understand what you mean how would that be cheating you know forget it did I already use all my fucking potions well I'm sorry I'm coming come on let me I need more potions
[98:35.88]Let's get some magic power.
[98:38.42]I want some more of these.
[98:42.98]Okay, that's fine.
[98:47.50]I think I want to get... I think I'm looking for... Whatever.
[98:52.54]Alright, I got what you need.
[98:59.13]Okay.
[99:01.21]Come give it to me.
[99:04.03]Portal gun incoming.
[99:07.11]Thanks, bro.
[99:11.63]Here you go.
[99:12.21]Okay, bro.
[99:13.52]Oh, okay.
[99:15.14]I was gonna entrust the portal gun to you.
[99:18.06]No.
[99:18.52]Don't trust me with a damn thing.
[99:20.44]Okay.
[99:28.37]Are we fighting a boss right now?
[99:30.69]Uh, not yet.
[99:41.93]Okay, so you go on this side, come out that side.
[99:44.77]Okay, we might need to make this wider.
[99:46.85]You can't go in the portal if you're on your UFO.
[99:49.76]Right, but what are we doing this for?
[99:52.88]Why do we have a portal?
[99:54.00]Because we're going to fight a boss, and it's undodgeable.
[99:58.12]Undodgeable.
[100:00.03]It really helps to have... So, what you mean, just like, go in portal, and you end up over here, and then do it again, just run around in a circle?
[100:08.84]Uh, yeah, like, once it comes towards you, you go in the portal, and then when it comes back towards you again, you go in the portal again.
[100:13.82]Uh, it's not foolproof, you're going to die, but it'll help.
[100:18.59]What if I just stand protected in a man-made house?
[100:24.19]No.
[100:25.05]What do you mean, no?
[100:26.83]I mean, they all go through walls.
[100:35.13]uh phantoplasm no warning okay a like three two one would have been slightly helpful
[101:16.85]You know, 20-20 hindsight, you should have made me the guy that has 50,000 HP.
[101:21.13]Not the guy that dies in two hits.
[101:22.47]It would be really easy to switch to it if you want to.
[101:24.87]The armor that we get after killing Ragnaros.
[101:28.09]Not Ragsmaros.
[101:30.39]Ragnarok.
[101:32.29]It gives you an armor set for melee, and the special ability button makes you immune.
[101:38.85]For like a couple seconds.
[101:40.35]And it also gives you shields as you attack.
[101:47.56]And also, you should have made me blah blah blah.
[101:49.82]Like, I didn't make you anything.
[101:52.35]You said, Summoner, you should do it.
[101:55.55]It's so much fun.
[101:56.63]And you enticed me with fun, cool little pets.
[102:04.13]Well, little bro, if you want the melee set, I can make that for you and get you the lifesteal item so that you can just swing at things and press the immune button when you feel scared.
[102:10.81]No, I'm just kidding.
[102:11.37]It's fine.
[102:11.73]I'm fine.
[102:13.05]You sure?
[102:13.39]It's very good.
[102:14.87]There's no shame.
[102:15.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[102:21.39]Okay, he said no.
[102:30.20]I lasted a lot longer that time.
[102:36.37]Jeremiah, blink twice.
[102:37.29]Are you actually having fun?
[102:45.39]Terraria is a good game.
[102:49.25]I'm sure it was Illuminate.
[102:50.29]No, Illuminate is irrelevant.
[102:53.63]That was blink twice if you're having fun.
[102:55.53]So, come on.
[102:56.53]Yolo Bloom and I forget the other one now.
[102:58.71]I'm pretty sure that's irrelevant.
[103:10.34]Um... What is this?
[103:13.38]A rocket launcher?
[103:17.70]I want to get the other boss to summon.
[103:19.00]I think we just gotta kill things.
[103:21.94]Just kill stuff.
[103:30.45]Get down there.
[103:32.81]Get down there and attack that.
[103:37.29]You guys are stupid, but when you get down, you finally do something.
[103:47.51]Imagine you're being called stupid and it's drama.
[103:51.47]Stupid!
[103:59.19]Why are you digging?
[104:00.73]Can you just go down?
[104:03.02]Yeah, I like digging.
[104:04.02]Why are you doing that?
[104:05.48]Honestly, I really like the sound digging mix in Terraria.
[104:11.09]And you gotta make things like, like once you can dig this fast, you gotta make things like symmetrical and even.
[104:19.79]I just realized you're doing like 700 damage every quarter second.
[104:26.58]Yeah.
[104:30.03]Got a problem, bro?
[104:31.53]Yeah, kind of.
[104:39.42]There's no water candles here, that's what's going on.
[104:42.10]There's no water cannons.
[104:44.78]Waterer.
[104:45.56]Also, I'm getting spikes off the wall, so it's not touching.
[104:51.76]You do that per fireball, per quarter, per second.
[104:57.10]You can equip the DPS meter and see what your DPS is.
[105:00.85]Let's compare it on the next boss.
[105:03.19]Oh, you should have one.
[105:04.67]You should have it showing up on the right-hand side because I have one.
[105:07.01]Yeah, what do you got?
[105:08.82]Oh, you can also make a target dummy so you can shoot the target dummy.
[105:14.04]Let's find out.
[105:16.54]Read this.
[105:16.96]Alright, I'm stuck.
[105:19.93]Looks like you're sticking around.
[105:35.53]Ow.
[105:38.33]No.
[105:40.21]The little ghosts can kill me.
[105:43.09]I am just such a little shit.
[105:46.60]Wanker?
[105:47.20]What are you looking for, exactly?
[105:49.46]Uh, dungeon enemies.
[105:51.38]I think we got rid of all the water candles, though.
[105:57.20]Unless I use another Zerg potion.
[105:58.89]Hey, bro.
[105:59.57]Hey, bro.
[106:00.17]Yes?
[106:01.13]Go back up to the room we cleared out, and I'll be right back.
[106:03.79]Go back up to the room we cleared out.
[106:06.02]Yeah, that big square room where I was digging a lot, you know?
[106:08.22]Where there's, like, not so room.
[106:10.20]The big square room.
[106:11.92]Okay.
[106:12.86]Got it.
[106:16.06]Oh, there's an alien here.
[106:20.43]Will you attack it?
[106:21.21]What are you doing?
[106:22.61]Attack this!
[106:23.99]Kill this thing!
[106:25.33]Attack it!
[106:25.87]Oh, it's not real.
[106:30.63]In the lotion!
[106:32.53]Okay, I'm back.
[106:34.34]You're not even back up at the room yet?
[106:35.88]I thought I was- I had an issue, alright?
[106:37.78]Come on, little bro.
[106:46.43]The thing is, the funny thing about this is people don't even know.
[106:48.37]I'm, like, older than you.
[106:51.67]He doesn't know, Pepe.
[106:53.31]Guy.
[106:53.97]He doesn't know.
[107:02.95]Okay, don't die.
[107:04.39]What?
[107:05.37]What the fuck?
[107:06.55]You can't just do this to me.
[107:11.25]I said don't die.
[107:12.13]Oh, that's some slowdown.
[107:20.73]Okay, here comes not plant terror.
[107:25.13]But there's no potions available.
[107:36.37]Okay, what's your GPS?
[107:46.99]I'm dead.
[107:48.84]Oh.
[107:49.26]Oh, your thing's still shooting at it.
[108:01.58]Why do I die so fast?
[108:04.11]I don't know.
[108:06.57]Star, why do I die in two hits?
[108:08.91]Because the summoner armors throughout the entire game provide the least amount of armor.
[108:15.54]So you're taking more damage than any other class.
[108:18.12]Oh.
[108:19.84]And also you're just getting hit a lot.
[108:22.20]It's a combination of those two things.
[108:24.52]How many times do you have to get hit before you die?
[108:26.92]You.
[108:29.85]I don't think I can.
[108:32.69]You can't die.
[108:34.75]Yeah.
[108:42.00]It's like impossible to avoid damage in this game, though.
[108:44.74]Because shit is just on every pixel of your screen.
[108:48.20]Oh, that's not true.
[108:50.51]Not true.
[108:55.79]You literally can't die if you just go melee.
[108:59.85]You really should.
[109:00.43]Alright, I'm going melee.
[109:03.23]Let's go.
[109:05.13]I'll come back and buy the shit for you.
[109:12.03]I think I still have it in my inventory.
[109:18.48]Melee is so boring, though.
[109:19.60]Yeah, but I've been playing this the whole time.
[109:23.00]And if I really am just going to go like... Dead.
[109:26.22]I'd like to play the game.
[109:33.77]Okay.
[109:34.25]Are you ready for me to hand things to you?
[109:35.73]Mm-hmm.
[109:36.75]Nope.
[109:38.23]Not yet.
[109:38.63]Uh-huh.
[109:38.95]No.
[109:40.23]Now I am.
[109:41.97]Take that.
[109:43.42]Wait, was that the right one?
[109:45.16]What should it be?
[109:45.58]Yeah, that's the right one.
[109:49.88]Take that.
[109:51.18]Nice.
[109:51.56]Take that.
[109:52.34]Nice.
[109:54.18]Take that.
[109:54.96]Nice.
[109:56.20]Take that.
[109:56.86]Ooh.
[109:58.76]Uh, and I'll go get you the, um, the, uh, I don't care anymore lifestyle item.
[110:08.23]Hey, thanks for boosting me to 60.
[110:09.71]Okay.
[110:11.51]No problem.
[110:12.26]Yeah, how come everyone in WoW Classic right now is like, oh, first to 60.
[110:16.48]Dude, just wait.
[110:17.68]Wait until they add the buy a level 60 account option.
[110:21.04]Do you know what I used to do?
[110:23.53]I'm not ashamed.
[110:25.45]Who cares?
[110:25.85]This was years ago.
[110:28.21]I used to.
[110:29.17]This is back before you could purchase any of that shit.
[110:33.58]I used to have, like, three characters, right?
[110:36.87]Yeah.
[110:37.47]So I'd have three or four characters, like accounts, and I would multi-box those accounts.
[110:43.71]And what I would do is I would bring, like, level 10s into the front door of a dungeon that they could get into.
[110:49.79]Level, like, 10, 15, 20, depending on what the requirement was to get in.
[110:53.27]I would sit them at the door.
[110:56.49]So three people in the dungeon would just be standing at the front door going into the instance.
[111:01.17]I would then have my main character aggro the entire instance.
[111:05.25]Every single enemy.
[111:06.87]You could not get hurt.
[111:08.71]And then I would do one move once the whole dungeon was aggroed.
[111:12.16]And they'd level up like 15 times.
[111:17.15]I think I told... My chat was... Because I brought up a few times.
[111:19.92]I'm pretty sure I told you.
[111:20.64]I used to multi-box level accounts and sell them on d2legit.com in Diablo II.
[111:30.56]It was a very short time of doing that.
[111:33.84]You'd have to, like, rush, like, a whole multi-boxed room full of characters to, like, level 80 and not use a single skill point.
[111:42.77]We've all been there, Jeremiah.
[111:45.48]Alright, let me see what these things do.
[111:49.32]Very weak note.
[111:49.93]Throws a hyper-dense watermelon that rains upon hit enemies.
[111:55.67]Holy shit.
[111:57.39]Okay, so the other one gives you like bonus shields as you hit things.
[112:01.15]So you'll have bonus max health.
[112:03.34]You become invulnerable to damage when you use your special key.
[112:06.32]You get like a bubble around you.
[112:08.24]Look at this.
[112:08.82]This is so cool.
[112:09.58]Yeah, those all go homing as well.
[112:13.78]Alright, so then... And the accessory I gave you is a big plus.
[112:18.65]I feel like I'm gonna need this stuff.
[112:19.99]Alright, so let's try this again.
[112:44.23]So now... Did you give me an accessory, too?
[112:49.54]Yeah, it's like a black glove.
[112:52.48]Increases the damage you take by 25%.
[112:54.42]That's a lot.
[112:58.84]Yeah.
[113:06.35]Okay.
[113:07.67]Alright, let's try.
[113:09.05]It doesn't matter.
[113:09.91]Alright.
[113:11.72]Hold on, I'm gonna try and make you some melee items, because I think we have all the stuff.
[113:14.87]I'm just gonna do that really quick.
[113:17.27]Because you still have, like, plus to summon items on.
[113:20.41]Yeah?
[113:21.61]Accessories, yes.
[113:32.33]Oh my god, I just realized I got a gift sub.
[113:33.71]Thanks a bunch, JermaSucks.
[113:37.59]Why am I wearing these boots and these old ass wings?
[113:40.57]I don't know.
[113:40.99]Are these bad?
[113:42.43]Frozen wings.
[113:45.31]I never got different wings.
[113:50.49]These old ass wings.
[113:52.25]And he's right.
[113:57.83]Any wing and then angel treads.
[114:01.03]Should we make this?
[114:02.38]We can make angel treads, but I just don't... I don't feel like doing it.
[114:06.38]Oh wait, no, you don't even have...
[114:08.30]I have Frozen White.
[114:09.36]You have Angel Treads, right?
[114:11.37]Yeah, you can upgrade them to Seraph Tracers.
[114:13.03]I just do not feel like... I have Frost Spark Boots.
[114:18.33]Oh, and yeah, you're a step behind.
[114:19.61]Then you should, like, not even wear them.
[114:22.20]Also, did you use the Celestial Onion?
[114:26.68]Did I use an onion?
[114:28.80]I don't... What do you mean?
[114:29.58]Do you have six accessory slots?
[114:33.68]I have four.
[114:35.98]And one of them's empty now.
[114:38.04]Okay, you put this in the storage.
[114:40.13]Here, take this.
[114:41.89]You put that in the storage.
[114:44.99]You use that item and it gives you an extra accessory slot.
[114:49.15]And you'd want it to store it for a better day.
[114:51.79]I'm gonna hit you.
[114:52.97]You have speedrunning.
[114:55.06]It's going too fast.
[114:57.98]It's going too fast.
[114:59.22]It's going too fast.
[115:01.34]You know, to be fair, I didn't explain to my little brother what he should be doing.
[115:06.57]That's my bad.
[115:08.03]You're going too fast for me.
[115:09.73]This is not just I started playing Terraria.
[115:12.07]This is... We just got to Disneyland.
[115:14.87]I've never been to Disneyland, right?
[115:16.65]And you are sprinting to fucking, like, Space Mountain.
[115:21.71]And I have a blindfold on.
[115:23.21]You're just like, let's go!
[115:24.01]And I'm like, wait a minute.
[115:27.81]I want to get a corndog.
[115:29.15]Fuck the corndog.
[115:29.83]Get in line.
[115:32.50]I mean, that's... That's what's happening.
[115:36.34]And then we go on Space Mountain, and we get up to the top of Space Mountain, the big drop, and then you rip the blindfold off and go, look down!
[115:44.75]And I'm like, what happened?
[115:45.79]Yeah?
[115:46.09]That's what it's like playing Terraria with Storm.
[115:59.45]But it's really fun, though.
[116:01.77]After I got off that Space Mountain roller coaster, I'm just like, that was really fun.
[116:11.58]So, I'm alright with this.
[116:13.64]Alright.
[116:14.52]So, what are we doing now?
[116:15.50]What do you want to do?
[116:17.06]Do you think Jerma would play Terraria for, like, 100 hours required to, like, learn it for the first time?
[116:25.71]I'm doing the community a service.
[116:28.11]I'm showing him this great game and like a bite-sized, a family-sized pack that he can enjoy.
[116:32.51]And it's great.
[116:33.91]See, like I wouldn't have built like a big giant compound to have all these people.
[116:40.72]I don't even know what half these people do.
[116:43.62]I don't even know what half these people do.
[116:45.26]I just know they're here and it's alright.
[116:46.92]Cool.
[116:47.22]Okay.
[116:51.18]Okay.
[116:51.50]Hold on.
[116:51.89]I got to remember how to build the ravager.
[117:08.19]Replace the emblem.
[117:11.65]The Guarding Avenger emblem.
[117:14.01]12% increased damage, 2 defense.
[117:17.39]Is this sucks?
[117:21.04]I mean, this thing doesn't do anything.
[117:26.08]I have so many better options than just 12% more damage.
[117:31.68]Let me see, what can I turn it into?
[117:42.99]Mechanical Glove.
[117:45.41]Melee speed?
[117:47.79]So I need to... Do we have a power block?
[117:49.91]Take this.
[117:51.59]And figure out how to upgrade that, because we should have all the stuff to upgrade it.
[117:55.71]I can do it.
[117:59.86]I was working on that, but I'm getting sidetracked by like 30 things.
[118:02.84]Mechanical Glove.
[118:03.80]Increases melee knockback, 12% damage, and melee speed.
[118:11.30]That sounds pretty good to me.
[118:21.68]Let's make it.
[118:31.59]Uh, would it have to be, like, one of these special crafting benches or something?
[118:37.30]Um... It should be right here, this anvil, I think.
[118:42.36]Either that, or it's way over here, the tinkerer's table.
[118:45.44]Instead, I think it's a tinkerer.
[118:52.81]Ah, shit.
[118:53.09]What am I doing?
[118:54.39]I know what I'm doing.
[118:55.29]Mechanical glove.
[118:56.05]There it is.
[118:56.39]Okay.
[118:58.77]So now I can... I mean, that's a lot.
[119:04.17]That's very fast.
[119:05.00]Okay.
[119:14.54]Looking good.
[119:14.96]Now people are still yelling at me for these wings.
[119:21.19]What are those?
[119:22.33]Is that what they're saying?
[119:25.45]A little meaner.
[119:25.98]A little meaner than that.
[119:28.80]One comment in particular said, You are the stupidest person I've ever seen play this game.
[119:34.24]And then their name is not in chat anymore, so they're gone, I think.
[119:39.32]So, I mean, that was kind of, like, really, like, unfortunate.
[119:42.18]Like, okay.
[119:42.54]I need a magma stone?
[119:44.20]Do we have any magma stones?
[119:53.87]yeah here you go nice alright so I'm just gonna make this like super thing I think there's one more step after that alright another step holy okay fire here and consider this item
[120:15.48]What the fuck?
[120:18.42]Okay.
[120:19.36]Let's go here.
[120:21.06]Fire gauntlet.
[120:22.86]Elemental gauntlet.
[120:24.88]Do we have a Yharnam insignia?
[120:30.07]Uh... No.
[120:35.79]I think we're very close to having one.
[120:37.27]I forget how to make it.
[120:43.98]I'm doing my own thing.
[120:45.38]Okay, so you gave me this Aegis thing.
[120:48.97]That's immunity to fireblocks and knockback.
[120:50.99]40% max life.
[120:51.69]Increase health to Supreme Holy Flame Dash.
[120:56.03]Activate buffs to all damage.
[120:58.03]Crit chance to need to activate these buffs to reduce your movement speed and increase enemy aggro.
[121:02.56]Okay.
[121:03.98]I forget this.
[121:07.28]What was that?
[121:08.56]I just did that and it turned to night.
[121:10.96]I did that.
[121:13.18]That would be funny.
[121:14.78]My gauntlet versus the... Get rid of the wings, right?
[121:17.06]Because what's the point of having this if I have the flying saucer, right?
[121:20.68]Oh, yeah.
[121:22.48]True.
[121:24.96]Do you have a melee emblem?
[121:26.04]Witch's broom, which is better.
[121:32.15]I'm forgetting how to actually make the good wings.
[121:36.49]Oh, we need luminite bars.
[121:37.77]I don't need this pendant anymore either.
[121:39.55]I have a useless pendant.
[121:43.38]I got a couple of useless things.
[121:47.98]Oh my... Let's just see how it goes.
[121:51.22]I'm willing... Let's just... Let's give it a little attempt here.
[121:53.62]I got more health.
[121:54.28]I got better armor.
[121:56.90]So let's do some... Let's go attack something.
[122:11.87]God damn it.
[122:13.73]I had to do this the long way.
[122:15.03]You mean the long way?
[122:17.60]Because I think I turned off that other mod.
[122:19.80]I'm not using minions, so why are you using the amulet?
[122:22.80]Do we have anything that's better in the stash?
[122:25.96]Better than what?
[122:26.98]I have a useless slot right now.
[122:30.72]Just look through equipment, and there's a couple things.
[122:33.05]There's an item that's 15% damage under 50% health, which you'll be at because of the other item.
[122:38.39]There's some other things in there.
[122:40.95]Um... Uh...
[122:46.79]There's a lot of toys in this toy box.
[122:49.21]What am I doing?
[122:53.03]Increases... 15% increased melee damage.
[122:54.55]Here it is, right here.
[122:56.37]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[122:59.60]There's the fungal spore.
[123:01.24]Look at that item.
[123:01.92]It's like a mushroom head.
[123:06.62]Your weapons don't count, but you will get a weapon that will count.
[123:11.15]True melee weapons emit mushrooms when swung.
[123:13.31]Boost true melee damage by 25%.
[123:16.81]So what... What do you mean?
[123:20.28]True melee is like when your melee weapon actually hits something and not the projectiles it makes.
[123:25.02]Okay.
[123:26.40]Alright.
[123:28.52]Does that... That includes the axes too, right?
[123:32.39]No.
[123:32.73]I don't think the axes count.
[123:34.37]But the mace counts.
[123:35.21]How you doing?
[123:40.97]Need help?
[123:42.95]uh we got to do the pillars again really fast we have to do the pillars again we have to do the pillars again huh yeah there's a the only way to get luminite bars is to kill moon lord and I had a mod where you could like buy moon lord packs but I think I turned it off and forgot about it it's like the only way we can get luminite again to my knowledge is by doing all of the pillars to summon moon lord
[124:13.54]Okay.
[124:15.94]I guess.
[124:17.24]Unless there's some other way to do it that my mods enabled that I don't know of.
[124:22.95]But now that we're big, strong boys, it goes really quickly.
[124:25.77]We are pretty strong, aren't we?
[124:29.85]The number one thing that's going to need to happen, though, is it's going to need to actually spawn the enemies.
[124:34.46]Hey, you wait here.
[124:35.32]Are you going to do another wait here, please, Jeremy?
[124:38.28]Oh, my God.
[124:39.00]Fuck.
[124:39.24]In my bed.
[124:43.25]I gotta pee so bad.
[124:44.75]Oh my god, I'm gonna pee my pants.
[124:59.30]I'll be- I'll be right there, bro.
[125:03.28]Um... bed.
[125:11.30]Okay.
[125:19.37]I'm getting off the fucking thing.
[125:20.43]I'm dead.
[125:23.15]I don't even know what hit me.
[125:27.93]He's dead.
[125:28.65]Pillar gone.
[125:30.99]The super boost accessory?
[125:32.61]How did we get that?
[125:33.83]Super boost?
[125:35.79]Yeah, there's an item that lets you, like, run as fast as you can see.
[125:41.72]It's ridiculous.
[125:43.02]Why is there a sand element tool coming out here?
[125:44.28]I forgot we got it, though.
[125:46.70]Oh, the Ragnarok boss drops it.
[125:48.40]It might be expert only.
[125:52.76]Well, that was very easy.
[125:53.80]That was very easy, boss.
[125:55.11]I got it.
[125:56.33]Forbidden.
[125:56.81]I got something forbidden.
[126:02.65]You can craft it.
[126:03.51]I'll see if I... Maybe I picked it up.
[126:06.31]Or I would have to kill Ragnarok again.
[126:07.77]Or apparently I can craft it.
[126:09.43]You guys might be thinking of something else.
[126:10.75]Because there's a couple mods that add similar things.
[126:18.86]Forbidden Fragments are outdated now.
[126:20.88]That's okay.
[126:27.78]Astral Ore.
[126:28.62]I got, like, Ore and shit.
[126:29.52]This thing's dead.
[126:30.20]So, dude, I'm coming back to town.
[126:33.01]Okay.
[126:34.07]Alright.
[126:38.17]I have to pee.
[126:39.91]So I'm gonna go pee for the first time in my whole life.
[126:43.15]Go take a pee-pee.
[126:44.27]I'll be right back.
[126:51.47]I'm just going to kill Ragnarok again.
[127:36.40]I'm getting, I got my adrenaline.
[127:45.50]It's a joke, by the way.
[127:48.31]You're supposed to laugh when I say that.
[127:54.39]Oh no, that boss doesn't drop it.
[127:56.37]I'm thinking of the second phase that drops that.
[128:00.00]Do you remember the name of it, Ashley?
[128:01.26]Because I would just go to our other server and like grab it.
[128:10.71]You could bring it here so I don't have to shut the server down and explain to Jerma how to join again.
[128:15.43]He despises joining Terraria servers, even though it's like a Steam invite.
[128:28.49]I don't.
[128:28.91]I'm sure you could find it, though.
[128:31.63]I would appreciate it very much, and then we could do your joke, and then we can give it to him, and I could play the rest of the game with it.
[128:49.80]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[128:50.94]You'll get the fee.
[129:08.21]We don't need to tell him about that, boss.
[129:11.17]Oh, dude, does this thing drop Luminite?
[129:12.82]Is that what it was?
[129:13.40]Because this thing gives fragments so you don't have to do... I remember that now.
[129:18.48]I'm going to...
[129:22.62]But no, he doesn't drop Luminite.
[129:35.03]Alright, got some water.
[129:38.28]I'm back.
[129:39.68]Hey!
[129:42.14]Here, maybe if you have... an extra slot.
[129:46.22]There's that.
[129:47.14]Extra slot?
[129:50.94]That's right.
[129:51.62]I do not, but one of these I think is useless for me.
[129:55.34]Yes.
[129:58.90]He won't pick up the essences, will he?
[130:00.38]We have like 80 of every essence.
[130:02.47]Don't worry, guy.
[130:05.35]He doesn't know.
[130:05.99]Is there something I should know?
[130:14.99]Sorry, is there something I need to know?
[130:16.85]No, there's nothing you need to know.
[130:18.15]Alright.
[130:20.67]Uh, chat, congratulations, you have just made, you're now on cooldown, I will not look at chat for five straight minutes.
[130:28.84]I want, like, an on-screen chat cooldown read-o-meter.
[130:34.85]That would be awesome.
[130:36.59]Where, like, after five minutes, too, your stream would even say, streamer must look at chat now.
[130:41.33]And then everyone would get their thing in.
[130:43.43]No, that would be a terrible idea, because once they get the countdown, it would be like, streamer, look at chat now.
[130:47.97]And it would be like, O-W-O, O-W-O, O-W-O.
[130:49.37]And it would be crazy spam, and everyone would get out of their system, and you could just, like, in good conscience, look away again.
[130:56.58]Like, okay, Matt, alright, I've read you.
[130:58.64]Do you really want the only thing that you look at ever to be, like, O-W-O, or, like, streamer sucks?
[131:06.58]What, like a bunch of coffee pasta?
[131:09.56]What else are they gonna say?
[131:11.82]I see some really, really good shit in chat sometimes.
[131:14.89]I don't know about you.
[131:23.33]Owo?
[131:23.55]Uwu?
[131:27.21]Doesn't, like, uwu just, like, make you feel good inside, though?
[131:30.82]I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear you say that.
[131:36.34]I mean, like, when a cute girl looks at you and is like, ooh-woo.
[131:43.69]Right.
[131:44.11]What did you say?
[131:44.93]Uh, anyways.
[131:45.59]Stop!
[131:48.91]That's coming out of my video.
[131:50.01]You can keep that in yours if you want.
[131:53.17]I make what video?
[131:54.93]That's coming out of... That's not going in my video.
[131:57.13]You can put that in yours.
[131:58.89]I'm not... I've never made a video before about what you're talking about.
[132:02.71]I get that clip.
[132:09.33]God, this is so easy!
[132:11.09]Where's the challenge?
[132:14.82]By the way, while I was peeing, I decided that during the course of the pee, I was going to have a rating for Terraria.
[132:21.56]Didn't we do this, though?
[132:22.48]Didn't we already do Terraria rating?
[132:24.18]We're done.
[132:24.58]This is the final Terraria stream.
[132:27.01]So I have to give my final score.
[132:29.03]Yeah, but before you were saying that you couldn't do it properly because it was with... It was what?
[132:35.62]You said, like, you thought Terraria was, like, messy and, like, too chaotic, but I said it's because there's mods and you've never played, like, basic Terraria.
[132:43.10]And it was skewing your review.
[132:45.26]Yeah, that's fine.
[132:46.34]And you agreed, but now you're going to review it?
[132:48.45]Well, I have to say, like, my final thoughts on the game.
[132:50.97]We just beat it.
[132:51.55]Alright, get up behind the podium.

[133:36.22]I think I deserve at least, like, an extra letter grade higher on my test for that one.
[133:41.80]People who missed this joke from before are really confused.
[133:44.48]That's alright.
[133:46.96]No, I worry about them.

[139:27.72]You don't get those.
[139:30.36]Alright.
[139:32.38]I did something.
[139:32.88]I think it's from fishing, but no one was fishing.
[139:35.63]Like, a mod added a different way to get a frog leg, and he had it, and it was in the storage, and I don't know why.
[139:41.89]I couldn't figure it out.

[150:00.93]When you say you had full health, do you mean you had half health?
[150:03.18]No, I had like at least like 80, 70% or 80%.
[150:06.74]I at least got to see the fireworks.
[150:14.00]Okay, I got the thing.
[150:16.60]You got a thing that you were looking for?

[150:26.59]Now my wife is happy.
[150:29.21]I got a Ragnarok treasure bag.
[150:30.55]Should I open it?
[150:33.21]Yeah.
[150:33.77]And then you're going to want to put on the Omega Core.
[150:36.10]Whoa.
[150:37.52]Dormant hammer.
[150:39.48]The Omega Core.
[150:42.12]Raises movement speed beyond comprehension.
[150:45.86]What do I replace?
[150:46.56]Are you wearing boots?
[150:51.62]Wait, it takes the place of boots.
[150:54.02]You don't need boots anymore.
[151:01.05]I don't like this.
[151:02.31]I can't use this.
[151:04.27]This is why I can't play Sonic the Hedgehog.
[151:05.71]This is Sonic the Hedgehog levels of speed.
[151:09.33]Well, you have to play with it until the game's over now.
[151:11.49]That's what Ashley says.
[151:12.95]And, I mean... Does this work in my spaceship?
[151:15.32]Who runs the world?
[151:15.92]Girls, who runs the world?
[151:17.52]Does this work in the spaceship?
[151:20.40]No, it doesn't.
[151:26.49]I don't like it.
[151:28.53]I don't like it at all.
[151:29.45]But it's okay.
[151:31.13]I will deal with it.
[151:32.49]It's cool though.
[151:33.95]Nice.
[151:35.17]You sound like entranced.
[151:38.21]What about the master of tides?
[151:40.55]Here, I'm going to make you good wings.
[151:42.51]Do you even want wings or are you going to be in your UFO like a dummy?
[151:45.84]I mean, the UFO sucks.
[151:47.22]These wings are faster than the UFO.
[151:48.94]Just take this stuff because I don't know what it does.
[151:52.80]Yes, give me the wings.
[151:54.80]We're done with this... horse shit.
[152:03.91]Thanks for making me throw up.
[152:04.99]I'm sorry, I didn't want to do the Sonic the Hedgehog super speed thing.
[152:12.71]Here's wings.
[152:15.20]Angry stardust wings.
[152:17.24]Allows flight and snowfall.
[152:19.68]Great value.
[152:20.88]Okay.
[152:26.93]What should this replace?
[152:32.29]What should this replace?
[152:33.03]I don't know, dude.
[152:37.62]True melee damage.
[152:39.36]More.
[152:46.04]I'm exploring the world!
[152:47.20]I keep hitting planets.
[152:54.37]Replace the shroom?
[152:55.35]No, I want to replace... This is still Megacore.
[153:04.07]Is this faster than the spaceship?
[153:05.81]It is.
[153:06.29]Yeah.
[153:07.81]It is.
[153:08.29]Okay, thanks for trying it before asking the question.
[153:12.77]Okay, you ready?
[153:14.95]Um, hold on.
[153:15.95]I can take the shroom off.
[153:18.45]Okay.
[153:25.29]I gotta take off my dash.
[153:27.78]My dash, like, very randomly throws me in a... This is... I would quantify this... I would quantify this as not fun.
[153:36.30]I'm gonna take him off.
[153:39.52]I'm dead.
[153:40.69]I just ran into the side of him.
[153:42.95]So did I. The dash is what's getting me.
[153:48.95]I would quantify that as breaks the game to a point where it hurts me.
[153:55.50]It hurts me to do this.
[154:00.72]I can't even pick up the stuff on the... Can we take this off?
[154:09.92]I don't know what's giving me the dash.
[154:18.01]But now I'm really slow.
[154:18.95]This one.
[154:21.59]I'm so slow now, though.
[154:27.24]I'm too fast.
[154:27.80]I'm too slow.
[154:29.12]Put the boots back on.
[154:34.17]Instead of this room?
[154:52.33]BabyRage.
[154:53.01]BabyRage.
[154:55.98]Make the angel threads.
[154:58.42]Star, can you make me the angel threads?
[155:01.74]Yeah.
[155:02.68]Here you go.
[155:03.02]Thanks.
[155:05.16]You already made them.
[155:05.78]I mean, yeah, I've been wearing them.
[155:13.00]I took them off for the Omega Core.
[155:15.16]Oh.
[155:17.48]That was dumb.
[155:23.38]I am the Alpha and the Omega, right?
[155:26.72]Isn't that what you always used to say to me?
[155:29.90]I don't think I've ever said those words.
[155:31.76]No, like whenever you're making a video and you wanted something to be a certain way, you'd just say, I am the Alpha and the Omega, and then you always got what you wanted.
[155:41.02]In a mean voice?
[155:42.18]Or in like a, just like telling you that?
[155:44.72]No, like a holier-than-thou kind of thing.
[155:48.06]I am the Alpha and the Omega.
[155:50.01]Yeah.
[155:54.71]Omega, love, there's more lines.
[155:57.38]So what's next?
[155:59.53]Ravager.
[156:00.75]Ravager.
[156:04.67]I love shooting the bubbles.
[156:13.52]So hard to control.
[156:30.67]It's funny, like, I fly up so slowly, and yet if I tap left or right, I'm gone.
[156:37.39]Ooh, I almost just whacked it.
[156:40.31]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[156:45.37]I was saying it, and he crushed me.
[156:47.04]Oh, my God!
[156:50.02]At my next trick, I am going to drink a glass of water while Star does voices.
[156:55.58]Be amazed!
[156:56.96]Oh, my God.
[156:59.06]Don't make mouth noises into the mic, Jerma.
[157:03.60]Did I get it wrong?
[157:04.48]That one was wrong.
[157:05.24]It was close.
[157:05.66]Play it back.
[157:21.47]I added an extra one.
[157:23.70]I did the part after that.
[157:25.86]That was the next part of the song.
[157:27.22]I'm proud of you that you could admit that you did it wrong.
[157:29.55]Thanks.
[157:36.78]Why is everybody blaming me for the gross noise you made?
[157:40.10]I was just drinking water, and you did the gross noise.
[157:42.90]I didn't do that.
[157:43.50]No, you, like, prepared noises for your drink because you thought it would be funny.
[157:46.92]And if it didn't go, like, your joke didn't stick, you could have played me.
[157:49.88]I said you to do voices, not go like... What?
[157:54.96]I said Star is going to do voices while I drink out of this cup.
[157:58.02]And then you just made a bunch of mouth noises.
[157:59.46]That wasn't a voice.
[158:02.12]What?
[158:05.91]So it's my fault?
[158:07.31]No.
[158:07.89]It's both of our faults.
[158:08.78]Okay.
[158:09.52]Yeah, you're really fun to work with.
[158:11.02]Hey, anyone want to do any like work with Jerma?
[158:14.81]He won't throw you under the bus.
[158:18.21]Yeah, I've read a bunch of shit about Jermo.
[158:20.45]I like his streams and everything, but he's apparently really, really hard to work with.
[158:24.81]He's notorious for throwing tantrums before broadcasts and everything.
[158:29.22]He's really hard to work with.
[158:30.64]You wouldn't believe the things he said to me before we started today.
[158:35.12]I've met him at events and parties, and he's like a super dick.
[158:39.62]Want to know why we didn't play for three weeks?
[159:00.61]I swear to you, I made an ankh.
[159:03.48]Did you?
[159:04.78]I think you did.
[159:05.48]I do remember that.
[159:06.86]No, you weren't here when I made the ankh.
[159:11.73]I'm just trying to... I'm just trying to seem like we're working together.
[159:16.35]I'm just trying to make it seem like... We're... Hey, we're doing this thing.
[159:20.91]I remember you made the Anki.
[159:22.31]You weren't here for that.
[159:23.52]You just threw me under the bus.
[159:27.02]Well, I'm not gonna let you lie to everyone.
[159:32.06]Here it is again.
[159:32.64]Jerma, like, wants to look good in front of everyone.
[159:36.42]Even if it means his friends have to lie for him.
[159:40.61]Okay.
[159:40.85]Okay.
[159:42.83]And we're gonna kill the Ravager.
[159:44.93]Oh, again, that was fun.
[159:46.71]When we died both together, like we didn't do it.
[159:50.61]Dude, I can't control.
[159:52.55]Alright, I'm ready.
[159:53.55]Oh, back up.
[159:54.01]Alright, come on.
[160:00.16]I'm getting damage reduction.
[160:01.38]You just said to do it and I activated my pot.
[160:04.78]It'll be like two seconds.
[160:06.28]I only have three minutes.
[160:07.42]It takes longer than three minutes.
[160:13.31]I'm setting up my mines!
[160:18.25]Okay, you ready?
[160:19.94]Who is that?
[160:30.70]Let's do that again.
[160:35.91]Oh my god, I'm so dumb!
[160:39.19]Oh!
[161:05.60]Did he just disappear because I went too far?
[161:07.22]God damn it.
[161:08.76]I can't not go that far!
[161:10.40]What am I doing?
[161:32.72]Why can I only hear the sound of my one ear?
[161:38.09]How far would you go?
[161:38.89]I need to hear this.
[161:41.97]I'm right here.
[161:51.69]That wasn't that bad.
[161:54.53]That was nothing.
[162:01.22]Are you fighting?
[162:02.56]Yeah.
[162:03.08]Oh, shit.
[162:03.68]I'm sorry.
[162:17.18]I feel like a snail when I fly up.
[162:18.92]Get the fuck away from me, guy.
[162:27.35]Get away from me, guy.
[162:28.05]What's this guy?
[162:31.05]This guy following me.
[162:34.83]They come through the fucking goddamn things.
[162:38.55]I'm too fast.
[162:44.89]Don't die.
[162:45.31]Don't run away.

[163:46.78]That's what it was.
[163:49.40]Blood Ocean.
[163:53.66]Blood Orb and Phantoplasm.
[163:59.04]Ravager is Pinwheel.
[164:03.09]We don't have Blood Orbs?
[164:05.83]How do we not have Blood Orbs, Jerma?
[164:09.71]um sure I can't even get in this hole is this is this a joke where I have this in my inventory and I don't know I don't think so I bought a bunch is Ster going to fight the four celestial towers nope
[164:31.81]I'm sorry, let me... I have to... I gotta butt in here and fix that.
[164:36.47]Is Ster, and then in parentheses after that, and watching Jerma, end parentheses, going to do... I just want to make... I want to clear up what you just said.
[164:48.20]Okay.
[164:51.83]Ster, end parentheses, and Jerma's eyes, and then end parentheses.
[165:01.27]I mean, I am watching.
[165:02.75]I am seeing it happen.
[165:13.48]Is Star, and in parentheses, and Jerma's Respawn Scream, end parentheses, going to continue to do the Celestial?
[165:22.51]That's so funny.
[165:24.37]That's a good one.
[165:26.37]Typically, I would fucking time you out for something like that and making fun of the streamer.
[165:29.91]But, I mean, come on.
[165:30.93]That's pretty good.
[165:41.49]Are you using that 25% true melee thing?
[165:45.31]No.
[165:45.96]Would you like it?
[165:47.74]No.
[165:48.54]I'm just... You might want to.
[165:51.64]I have the angel treads, the fire gauntlet,
[165:55.67]Here, take this weapon.
[165:57.95]Okay.
[165:58.33]This thing is, uh, too... Alright.
[166:03.03]Well, I have to reforge it.
[166:04.35]17... 17... Was it 1770... 1662.
[166:06.49]Is that the year you were born?
[166:07.89]Just give out your password on stream?
[166:25.31]I don't have 39 gold?
[166:27.39]What the hell?
[166:30.21]I dropped a lot of my money.
[166:31.95]So did I. Do we have any platinum left in the bank?
[166:37.23]We don't.
[166:40.43]We don't have any money.
[166:43.74]You know how to fix that.
[166:45.36]Sell something I have?
[166:49.88]Honestly, like, sell all the... No, I don't want you to do that.
[166:52.54]Never mind.
[166:52.96]Never mind.
[166:57.25]They just called this a pleb house.
[167:00.31]We use a zerg potion and just kill everything.
[167:03.11]Okay.
[167:13.14]No one will get in here.
[167:13.92]No one will be able to get in here.
[167:16.64]I didn't know this was like an artillery thing.
[167:29.72]doesn't I can't remember what bow I was using in the other game where I got it from anyway we gotta go to space space that means I get to be in this I think we need cosplay so we'll just hurry this up and
[167:51.35]Okay, so the Stormweaver has awoken.
[167:53.59]Hopefully he doesn't instantly run away.
[167:55.85]But he's a two-faced worm that comes up to space to fight you.
[168:04.08]Why am I still in that?
[168:05.58]Get out of the... Oh my god.
[168:10.36]I was trying to get out of the fucking UFO and I got...
[168:17.40]I was in the UFO, which was slow as shit.
[168:19.68]I'm throwing it in the trash, so I don't do that again.
[168:35.75]I heard that burp.
[168:38.21]Hey, did you come up here and pick up items?
[168:41.95]I'm gonna scream at you.
[168:43.97]I came up.
[168:45.87]Why?
[168:46.27]What did I do?
[168:47.77]What did you pick up?
[168:48.65]I don't know.
[168:49.57]I just came back up here and I ended up coming armored shell.
[168:52.32]What did you pick up?
[168:53.28]Armored shell, storm dragon, magnum rounds.
[168:57.96]Drop it off.
[168:58.54]Just drop it off.
[169:01.65]You think I'm not going to take care of you?
[169:02.95]I think that's pretty much it.
[169:08.65]Is that what it is?
[169:11.43]I don't know if I got that now.
[169:12.23]You're not gonna take care of you, dude?
[169:13.37]I don't know if I got that, too.
[169:16.85]Okay, we gotta go to hell.
[169:17.71]Uh-oh.
[169:20.74]Okay.
[169:21.12]What the hell was that?
[169:38.75]You can't hurt them.
[169:43.60]Oh, my bow does not even work here.
[170:12.48]You're gonna kill it!
[170:13.98]I'm trying!
[170:14.66]It's a ghost!
[170:29.23]I thought you were like a fan of that movie.
[170:39.31]I'm not afraid of no ghosts.
[170:40.91]Remember that one?
[170:42.17]Should I respawn and pick everything up again?
[170:44.40]Did you?
[170:45.08]No.
[170:50.44]Okay.
[170:50.76]Okay, so you pull those three bosses so that you can summon the other boss.
[170:56.10]And then this is like the boss.
[170:57.52]Okay.
[171:00.62]Before the boss.
[171:01.70]Hold on.
[171:02.04]Let me just dive again.
[171:07.76]Okay.
[171:09.03]Waiting for you to die.
[171:14.85]Okay.
[171:15.53]So, what are we doing now?
[171:17.03]I'm trying to remember how to summon the boss.
[171:25.56]He just made a pizza.
[171:26.36]Want some?
[171:29.00]That just doesn't sound bad.
[171:33.19]Armored Shell, Twisting Nether.
[171:36.05]Did I get Twisting Nether?
[171:37.48]I should have it.
[171:39.38]I don't have the drops from the boss.
[171:42.92]What?
[171:44.86]I got a Hellstone Brick.
[171:48.13]I got an Unholy Essence, Twisting Nether.
[171:50.19]I don't know where that is.
[171:55.09]Yeah, the boss we just fought should have dropped Twisting Nether.
[171:58.09]Did you pick it up?
[171:58.75]I have it.
[171:59.09]Okay.
[171:59.59]You threw it to me.
[172:00.89]I just did that.
[172:01.39]Thank you.
[172:02.03]Thank you, little bro.
[172:02.81]You're welcome.
[172:08.07]I need potions.
[172:10.17]We didn't get any money, did we?
[172:15.09]Not really, no.
[172:18.35]We're gonna need them.
[172:20.61]This is a tough fight.
[172:22.57]When I say before, like, oh, he's said that before.
[172:27.11]We do need money though.
[172:48.59]I need potions, I don't have any.
[172:51.85]I have healing potions, but not anything else.
[172:55.41]I mean, like, does it matter?
[172:57.37]Kind of.
[172:58.15]You said this is the hardest thing we've done.
[173:01.23]Yeah.
[173:02.37]How am I supposed to do the hardest thing we've ever done without my, like, 15 potions I drink before each boss?
[173:12.44]Uh... The devourer of gods made me bite my desk and there are several bite marks.
[173:17.80]What?
[173:20.36]He's right.
[173:22.20]He's right.
[173:28.14]Insane chat.
[173:29.22]Let's get you some money.
[173:30.48]Insane chat.
[173:31.98]I just imagine the front of your desk with just like teeth impressions from the dentist office.
[173:37.29]Just all over the front.
[173:40.75]How do you explain that to anybody, by the way?
[173:45.12]If anybody comes over your house and goes in your room and goes to your desk, there are bite marks all over your desk.
[173:49.52]What are you going to tell them?
[173:52.07]Come to me.
[173:53.67]That's what I'm gonna tell him.
[173:55.63]So he can earn some cash.
[174:03.58]Are you gonna tell him you have Flavored Destiny?
[174:15.95]I mean, that would be... You could say that.
[174:24.58]But would they believe you then they'd want to try it You getting money, yeah, I think so
[174:53.15]I'll be honest, I have no idea.
[174:55.09]There's a better way to do this.
[174:57.89]All I know is there are my screens full of things.
[175:02.23]I don't know what I think.
[175:03.74]Things are happening.
[175:04.42]That's all I know.
[175:05.22]Yeah, there's a better way to do this.
[175:07.28]Hold on right now.
[175:20.44]Get in there.
[175:25.91]Please don't spam in the chat.
[175:29.08]I think I have some money now.
[175:30.98]I've got 17 gold, which is not a whole lot, but it's something.
[175:38.96]Murray, where did you go?
[175:40.54]How much do you have?
[175:43.18]17 gold.
[175:43.96]19 gold.
[175:44.24]That's not enough.
[175:50.55]Hold on.
[175:51.23]I've got a plan.
[175:57.61]Have you ever wanted to eat something non-edible, like nice smelling soap?
[176:00.93]Yes.
[176:06.13]There is a store that sells soap.
[176:10.28]Uh, if you guys ever heard of Lush, there's a chain of... They've got all kinds of weird, like, cheese soaps in there.
[176:17.94]And by cheese soap, I mean they have these gigantic wheels of soap cheese that sit on these mantles, and they have to carve off of these giant soap wheels.
[176:28.60]You know, just stuff for your shower, your bath, or whatever.
[176:31.74]There is a lemon zest candy-smelling soap cheese wheel thing in there.
[176:39.40]I feel like if you ate it, it would be okay.
[176:46.58]Probably.
[176:51.62]You'd probably get a really bad stomachache, but that first bite would be like, mmm!
[176:54.80]Mmm!
[176:57.92]But then you, yeah, after about five seconds you'd be like, wait, no, no, no, no.
[177:03.70]But they have, like, a honey, they've got this, like, honey-smelling soap that looks like a honeycomb.
[177:09.06]It looks so delicious.
[177:13.64]When's the last time you ate one of these?
[177:15.88]I've never, because that's a bad idea.
[177:17.45]You shouldn't do that.
[177:18.29]Nobody should do that.
[177:19.37]How do you know that's a bad idea?
[177:21.29]Because it's... Oh, you had the Electro Roombas in here the whole time, you...
[177:27.03]It's chemicals, and you don't eat chemicals.
[177:29.45]It's a stupid idea.
[177:31.89]Don't do that.
[177:34.04]Jerma doesn't even know that the Electro Roombas give you, like, 40 platinum.
[177:39.48]Add that to the list of things that I don't fucking know in this game.
[177:42.72]12 platinum for selling these.
[177:45.60]Like, come on, dude!
[177:48.00]Fuck!
[177:49.91]Come on!
[177:53.52]I got so mad at my apple, I gave it bite marks.
[178:02.76]Biting my desk.
[178:05.70]I can't imagine.
[178:07.26]I can imagine just like... First of all, what kind of desk do you have?
[178:13.49]If you don't have a wooden desk, that's even more concerning.
[178:23.21]Rape desk.
[178:24.48]Oh, I know that.
[178:25.20]I know those.
[178:26.60]It's a cheesecake desk.
[178:32.22]You know, there's some fucked up billionaire in the world that has like a food office.
[178:42.32]This shit doesn't even work.
[178:44.38]He goes in there and pretends to go on his like hamburger fucking mice
[178:50.84]His cheesecake desk.
[178:52.84]His monitors, they're made out of, like, glass candy.
[178:57.85]He doesn't do anything in there.
[178:58.79]He just goes in there and just goes, yeah, I can afford this.
[179:01.41]And, like, takes one bite.
[179:03.20]And then somebody goes in there and replaces it.
[179:15.82]Come on, dude.
[179:16.74]Come on.
[179:17.04]Oh, I can't believe you didn't know about the platinum thing.
[179:19.44]You didn't know about the platinum thing.
[179:26.22]Help them.
[179:29.33]These people, they mean nothing to me.
[179:31.19]Holy shit, that guy just shot that dude in the face.
[179:33.75]Damn.
[179:36.87]They don't mean anything to me.
[179:45.77]What fucked up thing would I do if I was a billionaire?
[179:48.91]Okay, get up here.
[179:50.57]And then you can tell us all about Jerma World.
[179:53.01]No, um... Wait, we don't have a money problem anymore.
[180:01.90]What?
[180:02.20]Why are you summoning plants?
[180:15.36]I'm going in.
[180:16.74]There's a view somewhere.
[180:17.90]I don't know where.
[180:18.44]Why are you summoning Plantera?
[180:24.83]Oh.
[180:25.31]They didn't drop anything.
[180:27.49]I was just summoning a bunch of them so that we could sell everything they dropped for money and then they didn't drop anything.
[180:34.83]I would put it into like dragon egg research.
[180:36.84]Try to like hatch a dragon.
[180:45.32]I know, this isn't even working like... Oh, because I have to... That guy didn't even get a chance.
[180:56.99]What am I doing with myself?
[180:58.41]This is also... You can buy potions.

[181:23.25]So what's the best potions I should be buying and having, actually?

[184:05.75]What?
[184:06.11]By accident.
[184:07.27]It was fast enough to go the whole way it's coming.

[184:50.17]I'm trying to let my little brother fight it, so I'm like, staying still near this area.
[184:55.44]He was covering the whole ground!
[185:02.78]That thing was long, holy shit.
[185:05.80]Brother, I haven't even seen what it looks like!
[185:08.46]Okay, boy.
[185:14.46]Oh, all the guys are dead.
[185:15.58]I kinda needed potions, whatever.
[185:18.96]Ready.
[185:20.90]Hold on a second.
[185:21.54]Okay.
[185:28.95]Does it, like, gain my speed or something?
[185:31.53]Because it just suddenly jumped, like, a million miles an hour when I flew up.
[185:35.57]Doesn't this thing match the speed of the player?
[185:40.42]Yeah, I'm noticing that.
[185:42.54]Oh, shit!
[185:43.22]Wow!
[185:51.96]I'm noticing it.
[185:52.64]I forgot I could do that.
[185:58.83]Don't worry, Jerm is muted again.
[185:59.83]You don't have to listen to him.
[186:01.41]How is that possible?
[186:02.45]I didn't do anything.
[186:03.83]I didn't press L.
[186:19.25]His head and tail take normal damage.
[186:20.79]His body is resistant.
[186:22.28]I mean, I still did alright damage, but he just kind of... He just did the snake thing.
[186:26.44]He just wrapped around and went... Oh, shit.
[186:30.72]Somebody just gave a fucking hundred bucks.
[186:34.03]AmnesticOW, thanks for the hundred dollars.
[186:36.31]Turn up the music!
[186:38.59]I know.
[186:39.11]I'm thanking somebody.
[186:42.23]I just... I'm like... Thank you so much.
[186:43.21]Sorry.
[186:43.33]I'm sorry.
[186:43.85]For the hundred fucking bucks.
[186:45.09]But I brought it up.
[186:45.69]Turn up the music.
[186:46.99]Do what?
[186:47.97]Turn up the music.
[186:52.29]There.
[187:00.59]I, like, need the potions.
[187:04.61]Uh, I have eight of each, like, decent one.
[187:08.75]You want some?
[187:09.25]You want me to split them with you?
[187:11.70]Nah, actually I have good enough ones.
[187:14.60]Alright, so I think... I feel so low now.
[187:18.28]So he matches the speed of the player.
[187:20.22]Is that what you're saying?
[187:24.35]He might.
[187:24.75]Alright, well... He's wrapping around.
[187:58.64]Light time is lower than it should be.
[188:00.28]Do I still have the Ravager thing in my inventory?
[188:01.78]He's coming, he's coming.
[188:06.26]Hooray!
[188:08.97]Oh no!
[188:15.05]Please!
[188:16.13]No!
[188:16.91]Dear God!
[188:17.69]I ran out of juice.
[188:23.87]Stay alive.
[188:36.77]Now I'm mad.
[188:38.33]Holy fuck, I just almost insta-died.
[188:44.27]Can we do it?
[188:48.69]Does he not have a phase two, or is his phase two garbage on normal?
[188:56.48]Oh, wait, no, he summons all these guys and then you get phase two.
[188:59.04]Huh?
[189:02.84]What do you mean, then?
[189:07.07]Leave me the fuck alone!
[189:07.97]I'm trying to eat!
[189:19.88]This thing's zero point... Jesus Christ, man.
[189:32.67]This fucking... This is like Intensity, the video game.
[189:46.26]Stormweaver.
[189:49.82]Okay, now it's this guy that we fought before.
[189:54.39]And then it's the guy again.
[190:07.43]Yeah?
[190:08.23]Where is he?
[190:09.71]We have to do this again.
[190:13.21]Yeah, except this time more.
[190:15.91]Oh lord.
[190:16.55]Holy shit, I just got fucking air shot.
[190:31.47]Aye aye aye, I'm dead.
[191:01.94]think I saw this ravager in my inventory I can fly for like a second I'm gonna bite my desk you warned you're gonna I'm going for it hey don't worry he's at 80 percent
[191:46.45]Oh boy.
[191:47.53]I've really done it now.
[191:48.45]I've really done it now.
[191:49.97]Okay.
[191:50.13]I've done it.
[191:53.55]Oh, now you've done it.
[191:58.20]I clicked out of my window so many times this fight.
[192:12.60]I did it too!
[192:13.49]Fuck!
[192:17.01]I did not want to go into space.
[192:20.14]Please don't die, Jerma.
[192:21.32]Oh, no.
[192:22.08]I just clicked out of my fucking window.
[192:23.60]Don't give me this kind of responsibility with the giant worm.
[192:49.13]I summoned the Ravager by accident because if you hold down your mouse and you shoot at the top left of your screen, it will click the things in your inventory.
[192:56.87]Alright, explain to me why.
[192:58.71]I just clicked out of my window again.
[193:01.41]Why in the name of fucking god is that possible?
[193:04.66]Just playing full screen, dummy.
[193:10.56]I almost just turned off my VPN accidentally and would've like my stream would've turned off.
[193:16.00]Lock the hotbar how?
[193:24.15]I can't believe I actually summoned Ravager.
[193:29.41]What do I do?
[193:29.89]Oh.
[193:30.25]God damn it.
[193:31.45]I never noticed that.
[193:33.13]At least Ravager de-spawns.
[193:46.87]Jesus!
[193:48.25]I'm dead.
[193:48.77]Oh, where are... Oh, I thought it was following me.
[194:07.74]Are you good?
[194:09.20]Yeah.
[194:13.23]You've managed to go that way.
[194:15.31]Are you guys going that way?
[194:17.21]Yeah, we're going this way.
[194:17.99]You're going that way, okay.
[194:19.21]I mean, sometimes life gives you lemons.
[194:36.54]click out of the fucking window again.
[194:38.23]I don't even know how.
[194:41.75]I pressed like a different... I didn't even... I pressed like a different mouse button.
[194:45.23]Are you doing... He's floating this way.
[194:55.41]Okay.
[195:07.34]die again here you want to bite your desk not yet no don't die oh duh I'm okay I really wish I had those boots I gave to Jerma right now are you good are you coming I'm respawning you good
[195:35.42]Are you good?
[195:38.74]You back?
[195:47.03]Oh my lord, I'm gonna die.
[195:48.08]I'm dead.
[196:06.66]And I am... spawned again.
[196:38.77]Oh, I almost had holy fire or whatever the fire is.
[196:40.67]God fire.
[196:41.51]Oh, my fingers are just hitting so many buttons.
[196:43.45]It's too intense for me.
[196:47.22]Did we lose?
[196:48.72]Yeah.
[196:55.64]This boss seems very not fun.
[196:57.40]It's fun.
[196:57.90]It's just too much health.
[196:59.94]And I could have... I think we could both have much better weapons and accessories by now, but I've skipped so much stuff.
[197:06.14]It's too much for my brain.
[197:15.74]We got in close, though.
[197:18.69]Yeah.
[197:20.71]Yeah.
[197:22.45]Actually, our potions probably ran out.
[197:24.37]I didn't even realize.
[197:25.56]That takes forever.
[197:26.76]I usually take another one, like, after I spawn back.
[197:36.31]You want to give up right there?
[197:37.89]Is that the I give up in Terraria?
[197:39.91]I mean, or we sit here and wait for all the NPCs to respawn and do something else.
[197:46.47]Oh, they're all dead.
[197:47.33]No, they're all dead.
[197:51.34]That was our one chance to kill the god.
[197:53.90]Here, let me get my main.
[197:55.90]Go get your main.
[197:56.70]Do it.
[197:58.62]Go get my main?
[197:59.44]Okay, go get your decked out in full raid gear character.
[198:08.56]Okay, hold on.
[198:11.32]Are you actually gonna do that?
[198:13.55]Yeah.
[198:18.87]I don't even, I don't remember the items I had, and I'm, like, curious.
[198:21.51]Oh, I lost connection to you.
[198:23.43]Yeah, as I had to leave.
[198:27.88]You killed the Moon Lord, so technically you did it.
[198:30.02]Yeah, no, it was fun.
[198:31.56]Yeah.
[198:32.77]So that- Is the guy who beat Dark Souls on stream?
[198:34.79]That Devourer of Gods.
[198:37.05]Right?
[198:38.61]Yeah.
[198:38.75]Is that, uh... Is that, like, one of the last bosses?
[198:44.26]There's two more after him.
[198:45.58]So there's two more bosses, like, to end the whole thing.
[198:49.34]Yeah.
[198:49.80]Damn.
[198:51.24]Um, one of them is a... There's one hard boss after that, that's a dragon, Yaren.
[198:58.33]then after that is like the fuck you you put this way but that I'd like I didn't even feel like crafting shit for it I was just like I don't I'm not interested that's cool though there's a lot of content in this game there's a lot of stuff to do are you actually going to get your man or is that it uh yeah the server's up okay
[199:28.07]I should be able just to join you, right?
[199:30.15]Yeah.
[199:32.33]What was I using?
[199:34.03]Oh, this bow.
[199:37.01]True.
[199:37.89]Oh yeah, this was like crashing my computer because I had to replace my... Wait, what?
[199:46.13]When I had to replace my power supply, I lowered and underclocked all my hardware and shooting this bow was bringing the server down to like 10 FPS.
[199:56.33]Let me see.
[199:57.03]Where are you?
[199:59.32]That's you?
[200:00.42]All of those are homing arrows.
[200:02.34]So, like, the game just kind of freaks out.
[200:06.04]Also, you can have... Wait, no, you can't use that.
[200:08.86]Right?
[200:11.43]Yeah, you can't use that.
[200:13.89]It's too intense for me.
[200:22.71]Well, your character looks really cool.
[200:28.45]uh you ready I I guess do we have potions I don't have any potions do we need them or are you just gonna come in no I do have them because they're in my piggy bank and it uses my potions from a piggy bank I'm remembering alright so what we're gonna we're gonna go for it you're gonna kill everything in a second no it's still a really hard boss oh alright
[200:58.72]but what are you riding is that I thought that was a unicorn is it you know I'm a brony time to tell you that oh okay okay okay I'm ready I'm gonna get I'm gonna get in sticky I swear it's gonna happen
[201:27.66]Alright, show off, show off, show off, show off, show off, show off.
[201:31.07]I- I mean, I can't.
[201:31.89]Hold on!
[201:36.53]This boss is hard.
[201:37.43]The game's hard!
[201:40.31]I knew it was gonna happen.
[201:46.14]Clicked out of the fucking window.
[201:52.68]Only seems to happen on this boss.
[201:55.76]Because it goes to the edge of the screen and you, like, follow it off.
[201:58.14]Remember when you said that this was hard?
[202:00.28]It is.
[202:00.76]It's phase one.
[202:02.22]Well, you just killed that without even... I... I... Yeah, are things slowing down a little?
[202:22.51]No, I'm good.
[202:26.34]I'm kind of just waiting for the next health bar to go down.
[202:35.45]Okay, next part.
[202:44.72]Alright, here comes the destroyer of worlds.
[202:50.04]The eater of the gods.
[203:10.71]Oh, that's alright.
[203:11.19]I'll just beat Tails.
[203:16.25]Now you're definitely lagging bad.
[203:18.05]Yep.
[203:19.39]It's when all these homing projectiles start going off at once.
[203:22.45]It slows the game down and makes it easier to dodge.
[203:24.55]It's helping a lot.
[203:27.72]Holy shit.
[203:28.40]There's so many arrows.
[203:38.76]also you can see the arrows staying inside of him because there's like a hit delay on the boss so not all the arrows can hit him at the same time that's so stupid okay here's this part
[204:08.24]It's easy to dodge when it's, like, slow-mo, right?
[204:10.88]No, I don't have slow-mo, though.
[204:12.79]You don't?
[204:13.59]No, that's just you.
[204:14.29]I got a fucking beast of a computer.
[204:33.62]I'm gonna die.
[204:34.28]I'm not even gonna get to see the end of the movie.
[204:41.71]Jerma has left.
[204:42.65]What?
[204:43.11]What do you mean, have left?
[204:46.51]I think I de-seed you.
[204:47.83]Oh, shi- No!
[204:48.75]What the fuck?
[204:51.30]I don't even know where it is.
[204:55.42]I was gonna get to see it.
[204:56.48]I was gonna get to see the end.
[204:57.72]Damn it!
[205:01.30]Are you still in there?
[205:02.98]Yeah.
[205:06.69]Is it dead?
[205:10.03]It's like, it's frozen.
[205:12.05]Is it killable?
[205:15.08]I don't think so.
[205:16.12]It crashed.
[205:21.48]Yeah.
[205:23.42]What?
[205:26.22]Where is it?
[205:29.15]If you press M and open up the map, you can see it.
[205:31.83]This is not crashed.
[205:34.32]Its head's running around.
[205:38.15]Oh, kill its head.
[205:38.95]This is my chance.
[205:42.43]I'll use the other bow.
[205:43.37]I'm gonna die!
[206:01.23]Where is its head?
[206:03.35]Zoom your map out, you can see it moving around.
[206:05.82]Oh, it's over there.
[206:09.94]He's dead.
[206:10.50]Did it!
[206:12.20]Did it.
[206:12.88]Where'd it die?
[206:15.29]Right here!
[206:15.81]Oh, and that sword's really good.
[206:22.77]The Bower of the Gods.
[206:26.12]Excelsius.
[206:28.98]I'll confirm to drama beat Terraria, except for the other bosses.
[206:36.43]Whoa.
[206:43.33]I haven't been this happy.
[206:45.39]Oh, yeah, and you can boost your melee damage a lot, and that weapon is super good.
[206:48.70]Alright, I'll keep it.
[206:54.04]I have to have an asterisk because Star had to go on his big, cool character.
[206:58.74]Wow, I just wanted to see what happened when you died.
[207:01.62]Let's go over to the jungle real fast.
[207:06.28]I beat the moon.
[207:09.13]Moon skeleton.
[207:10.17]I was there for that.
[207:13.63]You're just flying around here.
[207:16.47]Where are you?
[207:17.99]Going to the jungle.
[207:18.97]Actually, the teleporter just takes it.
[207:20.23]I'm going to do that.
[207:25.20]Jerma has joined the red party.
[207:27.60]Was the jungle teleported?
[207:32.21]It's on the roof.
[207:36.47]Here, I need to... Hey.
[207:43.59]Okay, I want to show you something real quick.
[207:47.49]Show me something else cool.
[208:01.06]That was kind of cool.
[208:06.88]You can always teleport back to me.
[208:08.70]I will.
[208:13.68]I won't yet.
[208:24.39]Oh, well, Jungle Dragon Yaron.
[208:28.12]He's killing me.
[208:30.66]In one hit.
[208:32.61]He does that.
[208:35.49]Like, one hit.
[208:37.23]He's just done.
[208:37.99]You're up.
[208:39.05]We need actual platforms in the jungle if I'm gonna do it.
[208:47.29]Are you just flexing right now?
[208:52.11]Are you just trying to beat this hard boss?
[208:58.76]What else are we gonna do?
[208:59.86]What do you want to do?
[209:00.86]I'm just curious.
[209:02.12]I'm alright if you want to do a big mirror flex.
[209:14.59]Ask Star to make a drill containment unit for me to play with.
[209:17.25]I forget how to do that.
[209:27.81]What was that?
[209:29.45]I feel like that would be the Christmas present where you give the kid the present.
[209:33.26]He's like, oh, this is so cool, and he plays with it for like a day or like 10 minutes, and then you never see him play with it again.
[209:40.82]Like, wow, you went through all this work, and you made him the drill container, and you... That's alright, though.
[209:46.62]Yeah.
[209:47.86]Do you have an axe?
[209:49.52]Can you get this?
[209:50.66]Hold on.
[209:51.00]Oh, everyone's dead.
[209:56.02]That's why.
[210:03.16]Hey, remember when, like, cutting down trees was something you did?
[210:06.86]I do remember when, like, cutting down trees.
[210:09.80]Wow.
[210:10.02]Can you help make a platform?
[210:14.78]We just need a flat little... My friend, I have not carried around platforms in probably two streams.
[210:23.02]Well, yeah.
[210:23.38]Well, can you, like, mine some stuff, Daddy?
[210:30.21]Sure.
[210:34.76]Alright, what do you need?
[210:41.68]You want platforms?
[210:42.82]I got platforms.
[210:44.06]Like dirt?
[210:44.66]I just need like a flat surface.
[210:48.11]So when there's a dragon making giant firewalls and you land like in a puddle, you don't instantly die.
[211:17.21]Is that you?
[211:18.65]What?
[211:19.09]This looks like it would be you.
[211:21.05]What would be me?
[211:22.45]I don't know, like a guy who's just walking over here.
[211:25.27]I'm not a guy and I'm not walking over here.
[211:26.80]I'm the guy on the My Little Pony.
[211:28.72]A pipe.
[211:40.34]Get the fuck out of here.
[211:41.28]I hate these things.
[211:47.88]Alright, so how much do you need?
[211:48.64]How much space do you need?
[211:52.09]Uh, this is probably good enough.
[211:53.07]Is that alright?
[211:56.33]Are you Brad?
[211:56.95]No.
[212:00.59]I'm not Brad.
[212:01.15]No.
[212:01.21]3, 2, 1.
[212:01.51]3, 2, 1.
[212:19.12]I wasn't ready.
[212:20.36]God damn it, man.
[212:21.64]I swear this fucking click out of the screen bullshit.
[212:27.02]It's starting to get on my nerves just a little.
[212:29.46]I need to go into full screen mode.
[212:32.56]Dude, I don't even know.
[212:38.04]I'm just gonna sit here.
[212:42.92]I'm just gonna watch your stream.
[212:46.50]I don't even know where you guys are.
[212:50.47]You're throwing swords at him.
[212:52.05]I'm just like throwing stuff at Ren.
[212:53.57]You're doing all the work, and I'm just like, I'm happy too.
[212:55.53]I'm surprised this is lagging, because last time I was doing this, it wasn't.
[212:58.51]Get out of here.
[213:14.88]We're also not in a party, so like, I don't even know where you are.
[213:32.77]Damn it.
[213:33.61]Oh, he just went- he just killed us both in one go.
[213:36.87]He just went through you and through me.
[213:39.34]Laggy dash phase.
[213:41.70]That was a laggy dash phase for sure.
[213:44.10]He's such an annoying boss.
[213:58.15]So where is he on the scale of the Terraria bosses?
[214:03.14]Uh, there's one harder than him, I guess, which was Supreme Kalamitas after that.
[214:11.23]Can we see it?
[214:11.67]I... I never made the summon item for it.
[214:16.95]Hmm.
[214:31.70]Oh, and the item is also annoying to me.
[214:34.96]Is it?
[214:35.20]Yeah, I don't feel like it.
[214:37.78]Well, I'll just look at a screenshot of them.
[214:38.94]Oh, and you need Yaren's Soul Fragments.
[214:41.24]What's the boss's name?
[214:42.32]It is Supreme Calamitas.
[214:51.18]Supreme Calamitas.
[214:58.61]okay that's it right there alright is from stealing other people's content live on stream right now what I'm looking at an image of I want to see what it looks like you know what I need to do what are you talking about I'm looking at like an image of the boss this boat won't lag because it doesn't home anymore so are you you going for this again you got it you got like a bone to pick here huh
[215:41.55]Also, I'm not sure how much harder I'm making this on myself for being on a pony and not having a dash for when he turns into instant kill dash phase.
[216:01.91]Is it a certain health that he gets to that he doesn't?
[216:04.61]Jesus.
[216:14.16]I like the part where he goes And he like teleports back and forth while he moves forward Those are my favorite parts about this boss Why am I holding a piece of fucking wood?
[216:43.18]We're not sure if he's trying to go forward or backwards.
[216:45.70]I love that.
[216:46.32]I fucking clicked out of the goddamn window again.
[216:49.20]Why do I keep doing this to myself?
[216:50.52]Alright, here we go.
[217:02.10]Oh!
[217:02.78]He got me.
[217:10.01]Fuck, dude.
[217:11.01]Did he get you?
[217:12.90]Yeah, I don't have, uh, I don't have, like, a Crimson...whatever.
[217:16.38]Chaos...I can't remember the name of it.
[217:17.82]The rod that teleports you.
[217:18.94]Can I unmute it?
[217:20.98]Yeah, of course.
[217:23.23]Uh, I accidentally did.
[217:25.11]Yeah, and I tried it... I don't know how the fuck that's happening.
[217:26.81]When me and Ashley were playing, if you kill the Slime God on Expert, he gives you the stupid potions that, like, actually make you immune for six seconds that we just swore off using.
[217:39.56]Rod of Discord.
[217:40.16]Yeah, there's something in Calamity that Rod of Discord upgrades into that is better for teleporting.
[217:44.52]I can't remember what it is.
[217:45.64]Hmm.
[217:47.96]Rod of Discord.
[217:51.81]That's cool.
[217:54.15]Yeah.
[217:58.51]Oh, do I have the thingy?
[218:02.70]Is that where we call Terraria?
[218:04.58]We got to see all the stuff?
[218:06.30]Except for the last final boss, but that's alright.
[218:13.60]Well, actually, also, you kill that boss, you get him to 10% health, and then he runs away, and then you have to... You have to chase him down?
[218:20.38]No, no, like, he actually leaves at 10%, and then he's like, ha-ha, you'll never beat me later!
[218:25.36]Then you do it again later, and he's different-ish.
[218:27.68]Oh, shit.
[218:29.64]So technically, there's two more bosses.
[218:31.84]Yeah, and then after you beat that, you restart the whole game and play it on Revengeance.
[218:36.76]Damn.
[218:38.47]Which actually...
[218:43.82]I hope this, it didn't like delete an item.
[218:52.05]Oh, I was absolutely thrilled to follow along and enjoy Terraria.
[218:58.65]This doesn't even, we don't have any of that.
[219:03.69]Did they already beat Moon Lord?
[219:06.53]Yeah.
[219:15.66]Yeah, that's it.
[219:16.74]I don't know if you have anything else planned for today.
[219:18.31]I didn't even expect to stream that long, and yet here we were... four hours?
[219:23.29]Yeah, no, that's good.
[219:25.29]I'll probably just hang out for a little bit.
[219:28.29]Maybe I'll do some random stuff for like an hour or so.

[221:19.15]Alright, I'm going to give you guys a choice.
[221:21.01]It's going to be up to you.
[221:23.71]Either just Xbox, just Family Feud, no Kinect.
[221:27.59]Just play it and hang out for like an hour or two.
[221:30.81]Or... Or... We can do... Talk to Transformer or Tier Lists.

[222:32.94]Got a little overwhelmed throughout it, but that happens.
[222:35.73]There's a lot of info to take in.
[222:37.63]But, no, it was cool.
[222:39.11]I enjoyed it.
[222:39.85]Otherwise, why would I have wanted to stream it all the way through? 8.6.
