[00:01.55]Hi.
[00:04.09]Hello again.
[00:06.74]Everybody.
[00:10.04]And TV here.
[00:16.44]Welcome back.
[00:20.04]We're gonna play Dusk.
[00:21.86]Picking up exactly where we left off yesterday.
[00:23.76]This game is really good.
[00:29.59]Just do this.
[00:33.40]Can we just please see Otto before you're naked?
[00:39.56]Fine.
[00:40.84]Fine.
[00:58.44]Uh... You can't really see.
[01:01.69]Hold on.
[01:11.18]He blends in with a blanket.
[01:13.54]Let me see if I can brighten this up so you can zoom in on him and brighten it up.
[01:24.72]I'm not sure it's possible, guys.
[01:28.78]Actually, maybe it is.
[01:30.48]Okay, hold on.
[01:52.45]Hey, Otto.
[01:54.33]Hello, Otto.
[01:59.51]Hello.
[02:02.55]What are you doing?
[02:05.51]Yes, it's me.
[02:07.75]Otto.
[02:11.41]He's like, what are you doing?
[02:13.49]Who's my good dog?
[02:15.77]There you go.
[02:19.25]Otto spotted.
[02:19.99]This is just what he does, guys.
[02:29.16]He just likes to hang out on a big pillow and go to sleep.
[02:37.21]And he also likes going outside, too.
[02:40.01]He's like a lizard.
[02:40.75]He just, like, basks in the sun.
[02:44.01]That's what he does.
[02:48.22]He finds a spot in the house that has a strip of sunlight coming through.
[02:53.80]And then he just gets in it and just lies on his back and just absorbs every ray.
[02:59.98]He's the best.
[03:01.08]He works real hard.
[03:02.44]Are you sure he's not a cat?
[03:08.58]Pretty sure.
[03:11.42]Let Otto play.
[03:15.94]Guys, Otto doesn't know what a video game is.
[03:17.68]I hate to break it to you.
[03:21.42]But we're going to leave just right where we left off.
[03:25.27]Dusk.
[03:29.30]Now here's the thing about games.
[03:30.88]I'm sure a lot of you guys know.
[03:35.51]There's this period of playing a game that's like this.
[03:40.23]Where you're up and up and up and up and up.
[03:42.49]And it's been stress.
[03:43.65]Like good stress.
[03:45.25]Muscle memory.
[03:46.33]You're into it.
[03:47.11]You're ready to fucking blow away everybody.
[03:50.42]And then you go to bed.
[03:51.98]And you wake up the next day.
[03:53.72]And you're like a wet noodle.
[03:56.22]So I'm going to have to get back into it.
[04:00.25]Here we go.
[04:03.13]Oh, you can't even see it.
[04:05.45]Thank God.
[04:05.94]I thought my fucking whole stream was going to turn off.
[04:10.32]So, I gotta, like, move my arms around.
[04:12.42]I gotta get ready.
[04:13.04]I'm probably going to die, like, ten times in the first five minutes.
[04:16.98]I'm not even going to die at all.
[04:18.29]What are you talking about?
[04:22.05]But I love this game.
[04:22.67]This game has been more fun than anything that I've played in a long time.
[04:27.05]Stamp it.
[04:29.38]I enjoy this.
[04:30.10]Alright, let's go.
[04:34.62]Oh, where were we?
[04:41.34]Save, load here.
[04:44.24]I just started level two.
[04:46.62]Oh, Otto wants to leave.
[04:50.20]He's like, now I want to leave.
[04:51.55]Alright, let me let him out.
[04:53.01]Hold on.
[04:53.41]I thought he was going to just lie down, but he's like, get me out of here.
[04:56.21]I don't want to be in his room.
[04:57.19]So let me go let him out.
[04:58.23]Hold on.
[04:58.63]I'll be right back.
[05:26.16]Okay, he had his fun lying down.
[05:29.30]Did he show auto already?
[05:30.42]I did.
[05:30.72]Alright, here we go.
[05:34.78]Load it.
[05:38.92]Press any key.
[05:40.24]Alright, let's get back into this here.
[05:47.26]Timing on that is good.
[05:48.10]4, 5, 6, 7.
[05:48.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[05:48.92]Timing.
[05:49.16]Alright, let's go.
[05:55.00]Oh, by the way, I was told I've been doing this wrong the whole time.
[06:00.80]I was, like, flicking around and doing the jump that way.
[06:04.37]That's not how it works in this game.
[06:08.19]You just have to, like, jump diagonally.
[06:11.47]Like that.
[06:12.91]I was going, like, doing the source engine jump.
[06:16.36]And that's not what you're supposed to do.
[06:22.76]And I was doing it all stream.
[06:26.21]Well, this is new.
[06:26.73]Alright, let's take the super shotgun out.
[06:30.83]Wait, no, a rifle.
[06:37.17]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[06:42.69]Right in the head.
[06:43.43]See you later.
[06:44.73]Where are you?
[06:45.11]Alright.
[06:48.45]Alright, blue chip is up there.
[06:49.85]Blue door in front of us.
[06:50.67]There are a lot of people here.
[06:54.15]Oh, yep.
[07:00.95]Yup.
[07:03.03]You're here for that fucking commentary.
[07:05.01]You're here for the yup commentary.
[07:09.04]What's he at, up top?
[07:10.30]Oh.
[07:11.24]Yup.
[07:16.21]Alright.
[07:16.59]I'm gonna make some pretty good progress today, I'll tell ya.
[07:19.69]I thought I wasn't ready for this game.
[07:31.72]Holy shit, that guy used it!
[07:33.01]I didn't know they could use it.
[07:35.19]Yeah, they can.
[07:36.09]Where are they coming from?
[07:39.75]Where are they coming from?
[07:40.79]Alright, I need health.
[07:43.13]Alright, dog, slow down.
[07:49.30]Give me the blue chip.
[07:50.42]Save the game.
[07:55.04]Oh, fuck.
[07:55.66]Don't.
[08:01.09]Okay, how we doing?
[08:02.03]Good?
[08:03.27]I'm going to get over there.
[08:07.14]Good, good, good.
[08:08.22]Collect all the collectibles.
[08:10.94]Save it.
[08:16.36]Oh, pog.
[08:20.62]What do I want to do here?
[08:21.84]Anything over this way?
[08:24.89]Nope.
[08:25.87]Can I jump from here to there?
[08:26.83]Let's find out.
[08:27.33]Nope.
[08:33.44]Damn it.
[08:35.60]Damn it.
[08:38.18]Save Pog one more time.
[08:39.44]I fucking dare you.
[08:42.33]Oh, Jesus.
[08:51.19]I want to collect ammo because I want to make sure I have enough as we continue here.
[08:56.56]It feels so good to play.
[08:58.78]It feels so good to play.
[09:14.20]Ain't fuckin' wrong with you!
[09:20.00]So I have the blue, but... Alright, there's yellow over there.
[09:22.96]I hear another yeller.
[09:30.29]Where's Yeller?
[09:32.67]Secret door?
[09:33.99]Okay, I have to open this.
[09:34.91]Alright, there's a yeller in there.
[09:36.97]I don't know why I'm calling Mama Yeller.
[09:38.53]Alright, let's go open the blue door.
[09:46.22]Alright, save it.
[09:46.74]I'm ready.
[09:48.80]What should I use?
[09:50.16]Let's go with mortars.
[09:52.90]Okay.
[09:56.66]These are all going to open and there's going to be a bunch of aliens.
[10:03.66]Because look, there's a power-up on top.
[10:12.85]Don't get fancy with it.
[10:17.32]So what am I supposed to do?
[10:18.25]Okay, here we go.
[10:19.17]Ready?
[10:19.39]That's probably the yellow keycard, I assume.
[10:22.59]How do I get up here?
[10:24.61]Can I jump up here?
[10:31.64]Need to wall climb?
[10:34.73]Well, here we go.
[10:48.65]Uh-oh, screaming doctor.
[10:51.57]Oh, Jesus!
[10:53.61]Oh, there's a bunch of screaming doctors.
[10:55.79]I'm dead.
[10:57.17]Holy fuck, I don't even know where I am.
[11:16.24]Alright, settle down.
[11:19.01]Oh man, he's made out of noodles.
[11:20.30]I am, I'm not, okay.
[11:24.78]If I get touched once, I'm dead.
[11:26.52]This guy's freaking me out.
[11:27.42]Look at his pattern.
[11:28.06]His pattern's all fucked up.
[11:29.62]His pattern's all fucked up.
[11:30.74]And there's a guy up there.
[11:31.50]Alright, don't do this.
[11:32.74]Just run in and shoot him.
[11:34.65]Oh my god!
[11:35.45]Alright.
[11:42.17]It's gonna happen once.
[11:46.17]It's gonna happen once.
[11:48.34]Get my mortars out, I'm ready.
[11:53.85]Forgot about these guys.
[11:56.91]I almost had it, too.
[11:57.57]That's unfortunate.
[11:58.56]Mortars are definitely what I... Oh, crossbow.
[12:01.70]Probably mortars.
[12:02.58]It's just a bit more... I'm going to get... I'm going to run outside and go.
[12:21.10]Got it.
[12:21.56]Alright.
[12:22.49]Now I can settle down a little and take out the rifle.
[12:26.11]Let's get the big guys upstairs.
[12:27.29]That's it, right?
[12:34.17]Damn it.
[12:40.85]Alright, not pretty good.
[12:41.77]Not bad.
[12:42.23]Could have been better.
[12:44.53]Well, now I know you're up there.
[12:55.95]I could have jumped through the window and grabbed that.
[12:57.93]No.
[12:59.11]That's super... I don't even know what that is.
[13:00.96]That's like Ultra Move, right?
[13:04.58]Well, I have Ultra Move.
[13:07.12]Let's just get some health.
[13:08.34]I'm going to get Ultra Move and then... No.
[13:10.18]I've got to get the... I've got to get that key.
[13:16.09]Let me go down here.
[13:20.32]I'm gonna save the super-duper move.
[13:26.85]Ow, you bastard.
[13:32.45]There's another guy down here.
[13:33.19]There's like a bunch of people down here, isn't there?
[13:36.19]Yeah, there is.
[13:38.95]Oh my fucking god!
[13:40.07]I didn't know he was right there!
[13:52.08]Alright, come on.
[13:54.56]Holy shit!
[13:55.84]She can go through there too!
[13:57.00]I don't know if she can aim that way.
[14:04.65]Stop cussing.
[14:07.45]Alright, fine.

[14:17.11]Or I'll- I- If I say a- If I say a swear word in the next five minutes, I'll eat a ghost pepper.

[16:20.97]Even thinking about swearing can't... No, it doesn't.
[16:31.11]Have you ever even seen somebody eat a ghost pepper?
[16:33.53]No, you haven't.
[16:34.11]What you've seen is you've seen YouTubers take a tomato that's underripe and they eat it and pretend it's hot and they go, They take sun-dried tomatoes and then they pretend that they're hot.
[16:54.24]Here we go.
[17:07.61]Here we go.

[17:10.03]Here we go.
[17:11.69]Here we go.
[17:12.25]I'm just doing it just so you have, like, a bunch of clips of me saying it, even though you already... Okay, hold on.
[17:15.89]Oh, here we go.
[17:19.57]Oh, goodness.
[17:33.10]Okay, here we go.
[17:42.69]Did I just throw it over his head?
[17:43.83]Gotta go to the yellow door.
[18:12.49]Good work.
[18:13.71]Oops.
[18:15.17]Hey, thanks.
[18:15.57]What, were you talking to me or were you talking to chat?
[18:18.75]I hope you were talking to me.
[18:20.15]Look at these onions.
[18:22.49]I hear somebody shooting.
[18:23.60]Who is it?
[18:26.60]Oh, it's you out there, isn't it?
[18:27.76]I haven't gotten any secrets yet, which concerns me.
[19:05.98]Okay, here we go.
[19:28.20]Super hot.
[19:30.14]Super hot.
[19:31.82]Here we go.
[19:43.42]Oh, there is one of those.
[19:44.64]I don't like the slow-mo.
[19:54.30]It freaks me out.
[19:58.72]Alright, we're good.
[20:00.78]So now... We're not good.
[20:08.00]Now we are.
[20:09.72]Damn it.
[20:10.30]Alright, it's okay.
[20:11.44]Okay, here.
[20:12.10]I'm not gonna save it.
[20:15.31]I was gonna say the thing that I usually say, but I'm not saying it right now.
[20:18.63]Alright, here we go.
[20:29.53]Wait!
[20:29.91]Save it.
[20:33.36]Give me these onions.
[20:42.65]I'm just so concerned that there could be something around the corner.
[20:44.79]I'm ready.
[20:46.45]Yeah, I gotta stop saying, here we go!
[20:49.33]It's gonna have to be assault rifle and it's gonna be fast.
[21:15.77]Let's do it.
[21:46.59]Oh, man!
[21:54.55]Wait!
[21:55.41]That's... Okay.
[21:58.07]I was panicking for no reason.
[22:01.85]I thought these were projectiles coming to kill me!
[22:12.63]Alright, I thought these were just bullets flying everywhere.
[22:15.75]That's why I was freaking out.
[22:26.10]I don't want to touch that yet.
[22:26.98]I want to collect.
[22:27.54]There's a button to press, too.
[22:34.16]And this teleporter takes me somewhere.
[22:35.90]Hmm...
[22:44.76]A cage lowers.
[22:47.07]Oh, the other cage, right.
[22:51.31]Alright.
[22:53.67]It's harder to not say, here we go, than it is to say the F word.
[23:09.20]That was green.
[23:09.76]I thought it was a bad guy.
[23:40.58]We clear?
[23:43.68]Don't get run over.
[24:01.38]No secrets, though.
[24:02.28]Damn it.
[24:05.89]How did I not get any secrets?
[24:11.33]That's bad, because there's a lot of ammo and shit.
[24:14.27]It's been five minutes.
[24:17.17]I'm gonna use pistols, because... I just need it.
[24:24.44]I need to start using them.
[24:29.80]Yellow door right here.
[24:31.48]This is horrible.
[24:33.30]I already don't like this level.
[24:38.14]For obvious reasons.
[24:45.29]Hunting rifle is my favorite weapon.
[24:53.47]It's you down there, isn't it?
[24:55.04]Yep, it is.
[25:00.23]Make sure nothing else here.
[25:03.15]Secret.
[25:04.47]I don't want to get zero out of five secrets.
[25:11.31]Is this Turok?
[25:13.45]This game's better than Turok.
[25:14.53]Okay, nothing.
[25:19.98]Check over this way.
[25:20.80]Yup.
[25:22.64]This is what I'm saying.
[25:24.42]I gotta slow down.
[25:25.28]That's what I'm looking for.
[25:33.06]Okay, let's go.
[25:37.32]Save it.
[25:38.08]Is that a hunting rifle?
[25:39.14]Thank God.
[25:48.43]Psycho-scientist.
[25:51.67]Jesus!
[25:52.81]I hate those guys.
[25:57.61]They run so fast.
[26:09.43]Alright, red door.
[26:15.60]Hunting rifle.
[26:16.58]My favorite weapon.
[26:18.26]Because I'm pinpoint accurate with it.
[26:20.16]Got two in one.
[26:24.99]I'm gonna get up here.
[26:25.59]This too.
[26:39.59]See, I'm already doing better than I was last time.
[26:42.59]Put the hunting rifle away.
[26:43.51]Let's do... Do pistols.
[26:49.20]I've been neglecting them so hard.
[26:50.60]A lot of those guys are around corners.
[26:58.32]What was that?
[26:59.72]I just heard a laugh?
[27:02.14]Oh, I thought that was a wheezing laugh.
[27:11.86]What do I have ammo in?
[27:13.90]Only the pistols, seriously.
[27:15.08]What was that?
[27:27.16]I heard it.
[27:27.94]Yep!
[27:28.40]I knew it!
[27:29.34]I knew it!
[27:29.78]I knew it!
[27:39.21]Ugh.
[27:40.85]Point blank.
[27:41.31]Dead.
[27:42.11]Downstairs.
[27:42.53]Let's go.
[27:44.25]Where is he?
[27:47.70]Didn't even take a hit.
[27:52.44]Alright, I got yellow key.
[27:54.14]Nothing else, right?
[27:56.14]Nothing else I need?
[27:57.40]No, let's go.
[28:08.74]The darkness spreads.
[28:12.22]The darkness is spreading.
[28:15.50]Blue door.
[28:16.02]Assault rifle.
[28:19.08]Should I?
[28:20.63]I'll use it.
[28:21.23]I'll use it.
[28:21.69]That sounds like a good idea right now.
[28:32.66]What is that noise?
[28:35.44]I don't wanna turn the corner.
[28:36.61]I don't wanna turn the corner.
[29:10.27]Need the key.
[29:10.73]I almost just shot that.
[29:16.22]This is one of those adrenaline pumping games.
[29:19.98]I love it.
[29:21.68]You open a door sometimes and it's just like, you can just feel all your blood turn into a stone.
[29:28.13]And nothing else in here?
[29:30.41]Go down, I guess.
[29:32.43]There was another way to go.
[29:49.67]Down?
[29:51.01]Something down there.
[29:51.65]Okay, there's a diamond down there.
[29:52.88]Just wait.
[30:00.40]No, I'm going to go.
[30:00.84]I'm going down.
[30:05.66]I thought that I could have... No.
[30:08.68]Going in.
[30:15.03]Here comes somebody running.
[30:21.35]Oh shit, I just got triple tapped.
[30:26.07]Got him.
[30:44.39]Whoa!
[30:44.79]Wait, is there another sentry?
[30:46.69]There's another sentry somewhere.
[30:47.71]There's a turret somewhere.
[30:48.59]If I move, I'm dead.
[30:49.41]Where is it?
[30:51.13]Where is it?
[30:58.88]Oh my goodness.
[30:59.50]Okay.
[31:00.40]Alright, shotgun time.
[31:02.00]Let's replace that.
[31:02.76]I can use double shotgun.
[31:05.18]Yeah.
[31:05.82]I think that's the time for it.
[31:07.74]Why are they pushing each other?
[31:08.88]Who?
[31:12.92]It is blue.
[31:25.38]Alright, let's get that blue key.
[31:29.57]What was it over here?
[31:30.21]It's right there.
[31:31.89]Can I get it to this one?
[31:43.06]Nice try, almost.
[31:44.20]Almost killed me.
[31:44.98]It was close.
[31:54.28]There's a lot of stuff here though.
[31:55.40]I don't want to just run away.
[31:57.66]Wait a minute, let me check.
[32:00.76]No, let's just go.
[32:03.64]Somebody else will get the secrets.
[32:06.42]One of you guys will get the secrets.
[32:16.23]Run.
[32:30.12]I can hear him running.
[32:32.24]He's got, like, hooves.
[32:44.37]That's the way.
[32:45.45]Wait, what's over here?
[32:46.89]Nothing.
[32:52.52]That's a lot of mortars.
[32:54.52]That's a lot.
[32:56.71]Maybe a rib... I got a lot of... I don't want to use these yet, though.
[33:00.13]This is a boss killer.
[33:02.91]Let's use the mortars.
[33:10.07]Did I telefrag somebody?
[33:11.67]What happened?
[33:16.99]Where is he?
[33:18.95]I can hear his hooves.
[33:21.18]I can hear his hooves.
[33:22.10]Where is he?
[33:23.60]I hear multiple hooves.
[33:32.32]Where is he?
[33:40.77]Ow, my whole body.
[33:41.87]Okay, I'm fine.
[34:03.97]He's still alive!
[34:04.91]Oh!
[34:07.02]Okay.
[34:13.68]Can I peek out now?
[34:20.28]Good.
[34:24.27]That's why they gave all those to me.
[34:26.05]How kind of them.
[34:32.13]There we go.
[34:32.71]Up.
[34:44.29]Oh, why is there gas in here now?
[34:45.97]Alright, blue door.
[34:54.36]Blue door, and then I gotta let Otto back in the room.
[34:59.26]He's like, I wanna get out of here!
[35:01.40]And then he's like, let me back in!
[35:03.64]Alright, the blue door is down here, I think, right?
[35:16.11]Was it?
[35:18.86]No, it wasn't.
[35:19.36]Where was it?
[35:19.78]Alright, hold on.
[35:21.64]Let me go get him.
[35:22.33]Hold on a second.
[36:01.57]Okay, now he's happy.
[36:03.17]I'm watching like 15 minutes.
[36:06.40]He's like, hey, this room sucks.
[36:09.06]I want to go somewhere else.
[36:11.52]We'll see.
[36:12.98]You good?
[36:15.12]Watch out.
[36:16.10]He's good.
[36:21.22]He's just a cat.
[36:22.22]Alright, blue door.
[36:26.38]Secret.
[36:31.04]Ooh, this is good for me.
[36:33.28]That's very good for me.
[36:42.45]There he goes.
[36:46.33]Just sitting down.
[36:47.17]Good boy.
[36:47.49]Alright, let's, uh... That's a red door.
[36:52.87]Where's the blue one?
[36:57.04]I remember I always look at them and I go, there's blue door.
[37:00.80]And then I forget where they were.
[37:04.36]Where is it?
[37:06.82]Use your map?
[37:07.34]There ain't no map in this game.
[37:09.36]Wait.
[37:11.86]Is it this way?
[37:13.84]Was it over here?
[37:17.45]No.
[37:23.79]Hmm...
[37:31.74]Did I go back too far?
[37:32.58]I think I went back too far.
[37:48.23]Press M. There's no map in this game, guys.
[37:52.25]It was next to the red text.
[37:56.69]Was that I always just say there it is there's the blue door and then I it's gone immediately I Forget where it is entirely Fuck alright because the game may become back up here, so it has to be up here And that has to be back up this way right has to be I
[38:35.55]It was just around this little corner.
[38:37.09]Here we go.
[38:50.20]Red door is back down there.
[38:52.09]Remember that.
[38:53.49]Clip it for me.
[38:54.99]Oh!
[39:07.39]Shit, I just got destroyed.
[39:09.03]Alright, we're good.
[39:25.76]I'm gonna get up on these roofs.
[39:28.47]I think.
[39:29.51]I'm gonna try to at least, can I?
[39:39.89]I have to press, I have to touch this.
[39:42.55]Oh no, 5G.
[39:50.98]This is the source of the 5G.
[39:54.90]I'm gonna follow this all the way down, it's gonna be an alien down here.
[39:58.40]I always knew that 5G was fucking Satan.
[40:08.56]The whole wireless technology makes no sense.
[40:10.79]Like, you could send that shit through wirelessly with no wires?
[40:16.47]The whole thing's fucked up.
[40:19.69]I just quick-saved it right here.
[40:20.85]That was probably a huge mistake.
[40:29.90]Alright, I need to use the daredevil technique.
[40:50.88]Can't open this door.
[40:53.18]Both these doors don't open.
[41:05.47]There's a switch back here.
[41:07.87]What's it for, though?
[41:08.74]What was that?
[41:10.22]Oh, shadow.
[41:17.52]Uh-oh.
[41:22.27]Ooh, that's how you light up a place!
[41:24.70]That's a gasoline tank!
[41:34.41]Wait, the red?
[41:36.29]Was in a secret?
[41:39.61]The keycard for the red door back there is a secret.
[41:41.49]That's sort of... hard.
[41:43.79]Oh, we got the lights back on.
[41:45.14]This is fine.
[41:58.17]I heard it.
[41:58.79]Oh my god!
[42:02.33]I almost fell down.
[42:27.07]Where am I going?
[42:30.94]The ruin... What does it say?
[42:33.12]What does it say?
[42:33.64]There's too much smoke!
[42:36.60]The ruins held knowledge.
[42:44.23]We sold our souls for it.
[42:51.33]Altars built of concrete.
[42:56.92]Fed with blood... I missed the flashlight?
[43:02.76]What?
[43:03.00]Where?
[43:12.85]Where's the flashlight?
[43:13.91]Are you serious?
[43:29.78]I'm gonna run.
[43:30.50]I can't see anything.
[43:48.98]Navigate with your bullet holes.
[43:50.22]Oh, there it is.
[43:52.56]Okay, just give me a sec.
[44:00.90]This is the way back.
[44:02.80]I don't even use the pistols anyways.
[44:08.56]Wait, what's down there?
[44:09.28]Oh, that's where I need to go.
[44:15.73]Navigate with bullet holes.
[44:17.23]There we go.
[44:20.12]The ruins held knowledge.
[44:21.66]We sold our souls for it.
[44:25.47]Mm-hmm.
[44:26.19]Couldn't read that one.
[44:27.11]All parts of concrete.
[44:31.27]Fed with blood and bone.
[44:44.76]This door opens elsewhere.
[44:50.29]Nice.
[44:51.21]Secret.
[44:52.05]I'll take it.
[45:00.00]Get everything first.
[45:00.82]Something bad's gonna happen when I press this button.
[45:11.11]And then grind it up?
[45:24.03]I think I just power the facility.
[45:26.53]With meat.
[45:34.96]But wait.
[45:35.30]I don't want to end the level yet.
[45:42.62]No!
[45:42.98]I thought... It didn't say end level.
[45:49.77]It just said open door.
[45:50.63]Usually it says end level.
[45:54.99]It said exit, but it doesn't say end level.
[45:59.07]It says end level.
[46:01.49]I've been trolled a couple times with exits before.
[46:06.50]No, I'm going back.
[46:07.06]I'm going back.
[46:09.36]It's this one, right?
[46:32.09]Wait, did I get that shit?
[46:35.43]Yeah.
[46:35.65]Alright, I'm not going this way.
[46:38.09]I'm going back.
[46:40.02]There we are.
[46:40.70]Red door.
[46:46.36]Now, fellas.
[46:48.38]Ladies and fellas.
[46:50.65]Where was that red door?
[46:51.69]I don't remember.
[47:04.84]Over here, right?
[47:06.40]Is it this way?
[47:08.92]Red door!
[47:09.84]Here we go!
[47:10.48]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[47:16.47]That's quite, that's a secret.
[47:17.65]Now I have to get back to where I was.
[47:24.39]So the real question is, um, huh?
[47:28.78]How do you want me to do that?
[47:35.17]Just have to run there.
[47:49.28]But there's power here now.
[47:58.29]Am I going to lose the health that I just got?
[47:59.63]Nope.
[48:01.71]Good.
[48:03.65]Now I can leave.
[48:10.23]Where the hell was it again?
[48:10.95]Oh, I can open this.
[48:16.18]I can open these doors too.
[48:17.48]Remember these wouldn't open before?
[48:20.94]Wait a minute.
[48:22.34]There's like another door or two that were closed.
[48:24.47]This one was closed.
[48:27.93]This one was closed too, right?
[48:30.93]Ah.
[48:33.01]Don't read the tweet.
[48:35.76]Already did.
[48:49.90]Now I can leave.
[48:58.70]I just 100% the level?
[49:00.48]I did.
[49:00.76]That's the first time I've done that.
[49:09.99]But you cheated.
[49:10.93]It's alright.
[49:11.39]You can go back and re-cheat.
[49:16.81]Here it comes.
[49:17.23]The dig.
[49:22.48]No turning back now.
[49:23.62]Oh, there's health back here.
[49:32.02]There's two of them.
[49:32.96]Bad.
[49:38.74]Oh, that was... That's why there's all the health back here.
[49:43.32]I see.
[49:48.97]Mortars.
[50:02.48]Exterminated!
[50:07.39]Crossbow.
[50:14.63]Why is this here?
[50:15.17]Alright, I'm not going there yet.
[50:21.51]Let's go this way?
[50:40.83]Whoa, you were standing there.
[50:55.84]Big whoa, big whoa.
[51:07.46]Anything down here?
[51:09.58]Red door.
[51:10.80]Okay.
[51:11.52]I want to take a mental picture of this place.
[51:15.10]Stairwell.
[51:16.30]Goes down with the grate with the lava.
[51:20.66]Around the corner.
[51:21.84]Grate with lava.
[51:22.85]Downstairs.
[51:23.63]Red door.
[51:25.31]I got it.
[51:26.25]Memorized.
[51:27.35]Downstairs.
[51:28.73]Red door.
[51:29.45]Lava grate.
[51:30.37]Got it.
[51:36.13]Okay, yellow door.
[51:38.11]Yellow door is in the same room as red door.
[51:40.27]They're in the same room upstairs instead of down.
[51:42.93]Up the stairs.
[51:43.87]They're in the same area.
[51:44.93]Got it.
[51:45.18]Okay.
[51:57.97]Green pyramid, red door.
[51:59.13]No, don't say that.
[52:03.74]You're gonna mess it up.
[52:04.34]I know what it is.
[52:04.90]It's red lava grate.
[52:09.64]Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[52:29.94]That spikes.
[52:30.67]If I slide under there, I'm dead.
[52:38.30]That's a mama.
[52:38.80]Whoa!
[52:55.29]Nice aim!
[53:03.81]Let's check the rest of this place out, what we got.
[53:16.31]I still have a lot of the Riveter ammo.
[53:18.29]I should probably use it.
[53:21.55]Though, no.
[53:22.19]It's boss only.
[53:23.05]Bosses only.
[53:29.40]Red key.
[53:29.76]I know where that room is.
[53:46.39]That's a new enemy?
[53:47.13]No it's not.
[53:49.69]I've seen that enemy a million times.
[53:56.62]Gotta make these count.
[53:57.82]I can't just miss.
[54:06.99]I want to get up there.
[54:07.83]Blue key up there.
[54:15.85]Whatever.
[54:16.45]Just let me out.
[54:39.51]Red.
[54:41.47]This is a room that's going to be full with people.
[54:52.96]They're all down.
[54:53.44]They're all down.
[54:53.84]They're all down.
[54:57.72]Give me... No!
[55:04.47]Stop it!
[55:04.93]I want this!
[55:06.99]Can that go through the grate?
[55:08.59]Yep.
[55:23.56]Alright, anything else up here?
[55:25.62]Secrets.
[55:26.66]Money.
[55:31.81]Ah, blue door.
[55:32.93]This is where the blue door is.
[55:34.11]Alright, I will forget this.
[55:36.25]Green sewer room.
[55:38.17]This blue door.
[55:43.56]He only cares about money.
[55:46.22]Jesus Christ.
[56:07.07]Killing spree.
[56:10.71]Pretty good progress.
[56:17.14]What's the point of being down here, though?
[56:20.10]Can I open this?
[56:39.65]Oh my!
[56:40.53]No, no, no!
[56:43.60]Oh, fuck!
[56:49.38]Speaking gibberish.
[56:50.66]It's all just gibberish.
[56:52.84]Whatever.
[56:59.76]Boss only.
[57:06.64]Am I bumping into the wall?
[57:07.78]Oh, there was a wall here.
[57:17.64]They've turned us mad, teleporter.
[57:25.56]Let's move.
[57:26.74]I'm up now.
[57:36.65]Here comes yellow.
[57:42.45]Yellow key, I know what that door is.
[57:56.14]I only have 30 health.
[58:00.46]That's not good.
[58:02.46]This is very bad, actually.
[58:13.75]Missed a secret wall?
[58:14.57]What?
[58:15.95]Where?
[58:24.84]That's not it?
[58:27.36]That is it.
[58:35.62]Well, I got it.
[58:36.87]Put the mortars away.
[58:48.19]Double shotgun.
[58:56.67]Did you actually?
[58:57.17]Did one of these little idiots just got me?
[59:09.20]I'm gonna turn this corner and I'm gonna hear that.
[59:16.33]No.
[59:16.99]I'm almost dead though.
[59:26.43]Alright, that was... I need health.
[59:33.04]I need health, I need health, I need health.
[59:42.32]Damn, I thought there was like... I thought there was gonna be something over here.
[60:02.93]Give me an assault rifle for this part.
[60:10.68]I can slide under these.
[60:12.90]Can I not slide under these?
[60:19.42]I guess not.
[60:19.96]Nothing under them anyways.
[60:20.76]Nope.
[60:24.17]There's gonna be one.
[60:27.63]Damn.
[60:32.34]Took a while.
[60:32.92]Alright, I'm going.
[60:40.58]That's a terrible place to fight this.
[60:41.88]I gotta jump around.
[60:42.70]Alright.
[60:45.64]Double battle shotgun.
[60:46.36]I'm gonna jump over him.
[60:54.07]So let's drag him back here.
[61:06.41]That's a tight place to fight this thing.
[61:09.33]Maybe if I run by him.
[61:10.99]I'll try running by him.
[61:21.98]No, just gotta be right in his face the whole time.
[61:38.14]That is the key.
[61:38.82]Is that the key?
[61:45.95]No.
[61:48.77]Well, shit.
[61:50.23]Can I break this?
[61:50.79]15 health.
[62:07.77]Hmm.
[62:08.77]Well.
[62:13.95]Am I missing something here?
[62:14.77]If there was no switch, I could have flicked her in.
[62:25.87]Is this a collapsible door?
[62:30.63]Wait, what about switches over here?
[62:33.49]There we are.
[62:34.15]Alright, okay.
[62:34.90]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[62:35.86]We're good.
[62:47.00]Any repeaters?
[62:47.88]What do you mean, repeaters?
[62:56.81]Any repeaters?
[63:02.67]What?
[63:06.62]Oh, I don't like that sound.
[63:09.06]Why?
[63:19.65]This is why I saved it.
[63:20.75]This is why I saved it.
[63:42.59]I swear to God, Jeremy.
[63:48.32]That's why I saved this.
[63:57.49]We're gonna- Okay, I'm gonna keep it out.
[63:59.65]Cause... I keep hearing this shit.
[64:02.75]And I'm gonna press the button and I'm gonna get attacked.
[64:05.62]Again.
[64:13.44]What the fuck is this?!
[64:17.95]Why did I use the- I saved it there too, why did I use it all on the alligator?!
[64:24.61]Oh no, I used it all on the alligator!
[64:28.84]That wasn't even a real boss fight.
[64:30.48]That was the pretend boss fight for the real boss fight, which is this.
[64:59.91]Did you just bounce that back?
[65:02.29]Alright.
[65:03.89]That actually wasn't that bad.
[65:06.21]Uh... Do I have to do that again?
[65:09.11]Is something else happening now?
[65:17.11]Is that the boss fight?
[65:18.23]Before the boss fight, before the real boss fight.
[65:30.21]I don't know, but make sure I have everything.
[65:33.75]Okay, I guess we're just going.
[65:42.87]What about the blue door?
[65:44.31]What about the blue key?
[65:47.11]Aww.
[65:49.69]That was the real boss fight with the rats.
[65:52.93]Yeah.
[65:53.97]It kinda was.
[65:56.79]But what about this?
[65:57.45]What about that?
[65:58.81]How do I do that?
[66:00.25]Oh no... I didn't get it.
[66:03.50]It's okay.
[66:05.42]It's alright.
[66:08.46]One of the walls was baked, man.
[66:10.06]Shit.
[66:16.71]Pretty bad secret finding on that run, but it's alright.
[66:25.27]This one's called The Gauntlet.
[66:29.43]Hooray.
[66:31.31]I feel like this is gonna be fun.
[66:32.66]This is gonna be a very fun part of the game.
[66:39.96]I wanna get these onions.
[66:40.70]Bring it on.
[66:51.06]I can't jump up there?
[66:52.00]I absolutely can't.
[67:05.12]What is all this?
[67:07.80]Wait, where did I just go?
[67:08.68]I don't even know where I just went.
[67:11.06]I went through like a teleporter.
[67:13.12]I thought it was gonna be this... I thought... Okay.
[67:19.37]I don't know what in my stupid ass brain... I thought that teleporter was going to go to here.
[67:26.33]I thought it was gonna be a shitty engineered teleporter that they just build out of... out of just muscle memory.
[67:33.05]You know, you exit the spawn door, here's the teleporter, and then you go, and there's the exit, just because they put it down, because they were just OCD, putting stuff down.
[67:41.60]I don't know why I thought that that was the trap.
[67:43.46]Okay, I'm ready.
[67:44.96]I still want to get this stuff, though.
[67:51.46]Is there, like, a fake wall?
[67:54.96]Because I can't reach this.
[68:02.67]Do a rocket jump?
[68:05.56]That's gonna hurt me too much.
[68:07.68]No, I'm fine.
[68:08.40]I got 150 health.
[68:09.22]Let's go.
[68:09.68]Let's fight him.
[68:10.14]So here we go.
[68:11.49]Let's do mortar first.
[68:14.51]Fuck, I'm in trouble.
[68:16.95]Slide jump?
[68:19.38]Does that work?
[68:27.46]Rocket jump.
[68:27.90]Yeah, I'm going to hurt myself to rocket jump up here to get the same amount of health that I'm probably going to lose by rocket jumping.
[68:37.12]Do a crossbow jump.
[68:45.22]You can crossbow jump?
[68:49.54]What?
[68:57.29]Hold on, am I about to kill the boss?
[68:59.93]With this magic soap?
[69:10.64]Wait, where'd the soap go?
[69:22.75]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[69:26.50]Is this hope in there?
[69:27.34]What do I do with this?
[69:41.99]Most impressive.
[69:52.52]I feel like that's the kind of... Let me, um... That's not fair, though.
[69:58.59]That's not fair.
[69:59.33]Like, I just beat that... I beat him.
[70:03.53]I magic-soaked him.
[70:07.85]I mean, look.
[70:09.11]You told me how to jump up there, but I saw the door.
[70:14.41]I mean, it's... It's intentional.
[70:20.87]Alright, well, that was fun.
[70:24.14]Let's go.
[70:31.14]Three more to go.
[70:32.18]I can just walk around and just look at this.
[70:36.96]Oh, fuck.
[70:37.46]I'm in danger.
[70:38.18]There's too many things here.
[70:40.11]Where's the last one?
[70:54.03]Am I a cheater?
[70:55.51]No, I didn't input any commands.
[70:57.83]How do I open this?
[71:04.14]Maybe I should just leave?
[71:04.94]There's only two here.
[71:12.82]Just take the other teleporter?
[71:40.56]What?
[71:43.48]Where's the last switch?
[71:44.30]I don't understand.
[71:57.47]Go to the other one.
[71:58.14]I already did.
[72:01.54]Wait a minute.
[72:02.36]Hold on.
[72:02.56]I must have been turned around like three times then.
[72:05.66]Because I've tried to go to the other teleporter.
[72:13.04]Wait, is this the... Where's my magic soap?
[72:16.92]I hear rock music.
[72:17.86]Where's my magic soap?
[72:21.92]I put it in here, didn't I?
[72:22.86]Uh-oh.
[72:28.14]Uh-oh.
[72:30.41]One more to go.
[72:32.03]Don't get that yet.
[72:38.13]Sequence complete.
[72:48.60]Where is he?
[72:48.96]Where's the boss?
[72:50.58]Is he- is he dead?
[72:51.98]Oh, he's just dead.
[73:13.57]What's he- I got an achievement called Low Tech?
[73:26.91]It's because I didn't fire a gun.
[73:31.54]It's because I soaped him.
[73:39.75]I just beat it.
[73:41.17]I beat that episode.
[73:43.13]That was the final boss of the episode, and I instantly killed him.
[73:47.59]As you step into the unholy portal powered by ungodly means, there's no doubt what you must do.
[73:52.58]Hubris and fanaticism have woken something powerful.
[73:55.52]Horrible beyond anything you can imagine.
[73:57.58]You must uncover the truth.
[73:58.64]Who knows what nightmare awaits you in the nameless city.
[74:08.48]Cool.
[74:10.72]Episode 3.
[74:12.23]Let's do it.
[74:22.05]The nameless city.
[74:30.71]Out next week?
[74:31.33]No, out right now.
[74:34.99]This difficulty is not intended for a first playthrough.
[74:38.23]Although you are Jerma985.
[74:40.59]And this is your first playthrough.
[74:42.07]But you have enough skill to be able to press this button.
[74:46.30]That's what it said.
[74:48.82]Mint.
[74:51.14]Loadout.
[74:54.62]What is going on?
[74:57.38]Why can I cheat?
[74:58.78]Why can I cheat?
[74:59.36]Is this cheating?
[75:01.68]What's going on?
[75:18.87]Is this supposed to be like the god level?
[75:26.88]No campaign to owe.
[75:29.30]Oops.
[75:31.46]New episode.
[75:32.70]Alright, I see.
[75:33.36]Okay.
[75:37.02]I was gonna say.
[75:41.37]Episode 3.
[75:47.27]The Nameless City.
[75:58.78]The Iron Cathedral.
[76:00.16]Welcome to hell.
[76:13.37]Sickles.
[76:14.31]You don't get to keep anything, let's move.
[76:16.53]Get my flashlight, though, and I get the sword.
[76:20.01]Is this gonna- wait, is this a sword-only level or something?
[76:24.62]The sword is a silent takedown.
[76:26.40]At a hundred or more health, hold attack to charge strike.
[76:31.91]What?
[76:35.51]Wait, I... Charge strike?
[76:38.89]Silent takedown?
[76:40.23]Why does that matter?
[76:45.57]Can I hide a gas can back here on me?
[76:48.02]I'll be sure to use it the second the fucking door opens.
[76:51.70]And two onions.
[77:02.09]Let's go.
[77:02.61]Do I have to sneak?
[77:12.71]All of a sudden it's a stealth game.
[77:14.01]Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean stupid?
[77:26.12]What's going on?
[77:26.72]What?
[77:33.17]Gas can on the wall what wall what what are you talking about?
[77:36.95]At the spawn I love how I'm stupid for this
[78:00.35]How stupid.
[78:02.32]How idiotic of him.
[78:04.97]Do not go back to the wall at spawn.
[78:32.54]This is kind of fun.
[78:33.98]Playing a game where... Get out of here.
[78:47.51]You didn't even do that.
[78:53.05]What the fuck was that thing?
[78:54.37]It's a knight?
[78:55.01]It's a... It's a knight.
[78:56.55]Oh my god.
[78:59.83]Do I have to fight him with the sword?
[79:01.07]Is there a parry?
[79:05.15]It's a parry!
[79:10.29]That's a parry.
[79:28.72]I can't charge it.
[79:29.32]I have to be at 100 health.
[79:34.56]Kill him.
[79:37.40]Wait, this is... Hold on.
[79:38.44]I'm not going this far yet.
[79:39.60]There was a weapon over here that I could get.
[79:41.22]No, not yet.
[79:43.96]How do I get over there?
[79:45.04]I probably have to go down at some point.
[79:46.52]Alright, that is the right... Is this the only way to go?
[79:50.37]Kill him, you dipshit.
[79:51.55]Stupid dipshit idiot.
[79:53.09]Fucking idiot.
[79:53.79]Stupid... What a dipshit idiot.
[79:55.71]Fucking idiot.
[80:03.57]At 50 or more morale, hold aim with the sword to block attacks.
[80:07.99]Yeah.
[80:11.93]And you got a soap right here.
[80:15.45]You know, I'm pretty good at finding the soap.
[80:18.90]I will say.
[80:19.90]I'm really good at finding the secret soaps.
[80:28.00]Using them is another thing.
[80:32.76]Where'd it go?
[80:36.35]I'm good at finding the soap, but I'm not good at using the soap.
[80:42.03]Wow, alright.
[81:11.54]Using soap.
[81:13.88]Alright, now let's go... I don't have 100 health though.
[81:18.80]Stupid.
[81:19.98]Where's the soap?
[81:37.18]That's why your name is Jerma.
[81:41.45]I mean, that's pretty funny.
[81:43.64]It is.
[81:49.70]Wait for the guy with the knight.
[81:51.22]I need the knight.
[82:09.22]This fun.
[82:11.70]This is fun.
[82:12.48]Ah, I love it.
[82:18.06]And I soaped.
[82:25.51]No, don't.
[82:25.91]Why am I even doing that?
[82:41.19]Hey!
[82:41.75]What?
[82:42.01]Where did you come from?
[82:42.85]112 health.
[82:50.23]Where's the soap?
[82:56.53]I'm just gonna bring it with me everywhere.
[82:57.81]It's always good to get rid of one of the hard enemies with it.
[83:01.15]Although... Is this unlimited use?
[83:04.89]Can I use this as many times as I want?
[83:14.95]attack not gonna work like that man sorry he got annoyed at this check I still don't understand what the smelly crystal does
[83:53.90]What does the smelly crystal do?
[84:27.98]I didn't block it!
[84:28.52]Alright, I got the blue key, but, um... There's a lot of ways to... There's a bunch of random vents in this level.
[84:43.71]Um, I guess... Oh.
[84:55.24]I can go over this way.
[84:57.64]But there was another way to go, I think.
[84:59.99]I go down.
[85:00.63]There's a crystal over there.
[85:03.29]But wait a minute.
[85:03.71]I can open this door.
[85:04.59]I think that's progression?
[85:10.83]Hold on.
[85:12.71]My power went out.
[85:13.39]What happened?
[85:14.21]Mine did too.
[85:14.93]What?
[85:15.76]I just turned the stream back on.
[85:16.88]Do you live in Vegas?
[85:19.74]We're all mad here.
[85:41.52]No, this is... Okay.
[85:42.64]So, I do have a blue key, though.
[85:45.50]Wasn't there a blue door all the way back?
[85:46.76]I already have to pee.
[85:57.41]What a disaster.
[86:09.80]Because that could go down.
[86:11.18]Oh, I gotta pee.
[86:12.12]This is messing with my brain to be able to play the video game correctly.
[86:21.39]Yeah, I gotta go.
[86:21.93]I'll be right back.
[86:23.43]It's messing with my ability to play the video game.
[86:25.11]This is what happens when you just drink Lodge coffees every morning.
[86:32.33]Be right back.
[86:36.05]Don't go anywhere.
[86:37.31]Or if you have to go, fine.
[86:38.21]But if not, then stay.
[88:39.50]Alright, we're good.
[88:43.60]Oh no, I dropped my lip balm.
[88:46.70]I just dropped my lip balm on the ground.
[88:48.08]It's capped and everything, but it just hit the ground.
[88:49.96]I have to get another one.
[88:52.21]There's germs on the ground.
[88:52.97]Alright.
[89:02.47]How big is the large coffee?
[89:03.49]How many ounces?
[89:04.31]You don't even want to know.
[89:07.67]If I told you guys the amount of ounces that I had in my coffee, you'd think I was a fucking sicko.
[89:20.98]I only do this like once every few weeks.
[89:24.10]But every time I do it, I always feel bad about it.
[89:29.14]That's a secret door if I've ever seen one.
[89:34.94]Nice.
[89:36.97]Good thing I went back here.
[89:41.65]Now I got a mortar.
[89:45.47]Yeah, yep.
[89:46.75]Yeah.
[89:47.69]Yeah, it's 32 ounces.
[89:48.63]Yep.
[89:49.37]I know.
[89:50.33]And, even worse.
[89:52.77]Way worse than it being 32 ounces.
[89:54.88]Light ice.
[89:56.56]You're a fucking psycho.
[90:00.58]Hey, can I get that with light ice, please?
[90:02.08]Oh, okay, so you're a mutant.
[90:06.98]Okay, got that.
[90:07.88]Now I need the blue door.
[90:11.51]Where was the blue door?
[90:12.97]There was a red door here.
[90:14.95]Anybody remember the blue door?
[90:18.13]Anybody remember a blue door?
[90:21.77]I didn't burn it into my memory, because I don't think it exists.
[90:26.76]Blue door?
[90:27.48]Was there something else I could do back here?
[90:32.34]Blue door.
[90:33.00]I remember.
[90:35.36]And I got the soap here, too.
[90:39.19]You know, I didn't burn it into my brain because of that.
[90:41.67]This one, a blue door, is blue things next to the door.
[90:48.06]Nice block.
[90:50.98]I can't get more than one?
[90:51.70]Okay.
[90:52.58]For some reason, I thought I could get two with a swipe.
[90:59.38]Okay.
[91:12.71]Is that open?
[91:15.45]That, okay, and there's a beep, too.
[91:17.39]That was somebody, that guy fucking... That was a multiple jump scare.
[91:22.85]In front of me, guy running at me, and to my left, a fucking horn.
[91:28.24]At the same exact time.
[91:29.44]I don't know if you guys heard the horn.
[91:32.24]It was a huge beep.
[91:37.71]Somebody probably heard it.
[91:38.53]Someone with good ears.
[91:49.13]Soap is so good.
[91:58.22]Oh my god, I just got... embarrassed.
[92:06.55]That was embarrassed.
[92:09.81]Just straight up, I mean, just embarrassed.
[92:14.11]So let me get this straight.
[92:16.14]It's gotta actually physically hit the weapon, right?
[92:24.04]It's not just, hey, your screen is now safe.
[92:31.78]I blame the double jump scare.
[92:38.85]Alright, we're good.
[92:39.58]Now let's go back here and get the diamond.
[92:40.78]I don't even need it.
[92:42.02]Let's throw some mortars down the halls, huh?
[92:47.12]Soap is taking too much time.
[92:48.51]I'm going soapless.
[92:50.35]Sad.
[93:10.37]Okay, so, it's just, it's a mystery to go around here.
[93:16.07]Gotta find the right way.
[93:19.17]It's a maze.
[93:19.87]It's a mystery.
[93:20.73]There it is.
[93:21.13]I don't think that's it.
[93:36.33]Remember the crossbow?
[93:52.47]I just jumped over that sword.
[93:53.69]Just want to make sure we're all aware of that one.
[94:09.36]Alright, that's it.
[94:10.00]I got the new crossbow bullets.
[94:13.70]I didn't get anything else.
[94:18.13]Anyone else to go?
[94:19.39]I guess the lava arrow pointing down.
[94:22.03]Sure.
[94:31.21]Does the book do anything?
[94:33.00]I feel like the book doesn't do anything.
[94:34.00]Just, whatever.
[94:34.60]Throw it away.
[94:37.62]Who?
[94:44.54]Could've got those all with one hit.
[94:46.58]Not efficient.
[94:56.04]Look at this inefficiency.
[94:57.40]It's angering me.
[94:58.84]There we go.
[95:01.68]And I missed.
[95:11.29]The crossbow goes through walls.
[95:12.53]That's right, it does.
[95:14.35]I forget.
[95:19.61]Yep.
[95:21.61]That's pretty useful.
[95:42.58]Efficiency.
[95:43.20]Better.
[95:46.36]Not efficient.
[95:47.08]I feel like I could probably be efficient in this room, though.
[95:59.12]What the fuck is this?
[96:01.98]Why is there a dog in a box?
[96:19.25]Bad dog.
[96:23.96]Bad dog.
[96:26.67]No, not you.
[96:27.65]Not you.
[96:28.74]I know you're in the same room, but not you.
[96:40.48]I don't want him to hear that.
[96:41.59]You're a good dog.
[96:43.33]You're a good dog, yes.
[96:46.23]All enemies dead.
[96:53.96]Fire and Ice.
[96:56.20]This is a new item.
[96:58.14]Lava cannot harm you.
[97:02.01]Oh, that's in limited time!
[97:31.14]Do I have two swords?
[97:35.84]Oh, that's too bad.
[97:38.18]Alright, now what?
[97:38.88]Where is he?
[97:43.22]There.
[97:48.89]I need another one of those, the lava head.
[97:50.59]Unless maybe can I go up?
[97:57.03]Uh, I'm gonna try going this way.
[98:00.86]I guess I can go this way.
[98:01.84]Did I miss anything over here?
[98:08.46]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[98:10.50]How did I... Why?
[98:12.20]You... 28 health.
[98:15.43]I gotta shoot this thing.
[98:16.51]There's a secret wall here.
[98:17.55]Hopefully there's health here.
[98:24.05]Dick.
[98:26.75]Dick.
[98:30.17]Alright, there is health in here.
[98:31.11]Good.
[98:36.57]Lots of, uh... Really?
[98:40.96]Really?
[98:42.30]Now, what's that gonna do for me?
[98:44.66]Hold on.
[98:45.00]Can I get up there?
[99:02.86]Holy shit.
[99:05.27]Well, um... That's cool.
[99:15.05]I made... I skipped this blue door.
[99:24.56]Just don't fall.
[99:25.22]There's something over there.
[99:33.53]I have to make this jump.
[99:37.15]I have to get this.
[99:48.71]Load.
[99:49.27]Why did... Did I... Hold on.
[99:50.31]Did I just save it right there?
[99:51.85]No, I didn't.
[99:59.54]Good.
[100:00.42]Okay.
[100:01.83]Let's now save it here so I can get back across.
[100:07.88]Get back across.
[100:08.90]We're just gonna... We're gonna save scum again.
[100:10.62]Not that... It's not that bad.
[100:19.82]Alright, now I'm gonna open this door.
[100:21.50]I have no idea what the hell I'm doing right now, but apparently I'm doing this.
[100:25.90]Oh, fuck.
[100:26.78]Uh...
[100:30.87]Why did I just do that?
[100:32.13]Why would I jump away?
[100:33.25]I just did like... Fight or flight?
[100:36.83]It was flight.
[100:38.88]Flight.
[100:40.36]As much as you could describe what that word is.
[100:43.00]Flight.
[100:57.52]Oh, I can't right-click.
[100:58.96]I don't have any morale.
[101:00.40]Fuck.
[101:08.45]Zero morale.
[101:10.09]Right, okay.
[101:11.47]I need to have at least 50, right?
[101:13.15]Damn.
[101:16.67]That's not good.
[101:19.73]I feel like I'm going to need that gas can.
[101:24.93]There's a soap down here.
[101:31.89]What the hell did I do?
[101:33.05]What direction did I even go in?
[101:35.80]I need the blue key.
[101:38.54]I'm behind the door that the blue key opens.
[101:53.09]Right?
[101:53.35]I think so.
[102:01.19]I think I just have to go back, yeah, I just have to go back down.
[102:06.22]Whatever, okay.
[102:07.98]I guess I know that's there.
[102:08.90]No, I'm not softlocked, I'm good.
[102:12.98]I just have to actually go this way, which is the correct way.
[102:21.29]Okay, I thought that was not an enemy, I thought it was.
[102:44.42]God, doing like the extreme NPC walk.
[102:58.36]Pistol.
[102:59.00]There's nothing even here to shoot.
[103:04.86]I got the superpower up, but I didn't... Okay, there's red and blue door over there.
[103:08.41]I need a key, man.
[103:12.35]No one opens elsewhere, alright.
[103:13.81]Um, I guess we're just going down.
[103:21.28]I ain't going down there yet!
[103:27.46]Now I am.
[103:41.98]Finally, some morale.
[103:44.22]It's been forever.
[103:54.51]And a shotgun.
[103:55.21]Finally.
[103:56.11]Shotgun shells.
[103:57.01]Ooh, I can go... Let me jump... Hold on.
[103:59.99]Don't go there yet.
[104:02.41]What's over here?
[104:04.18]Nothing.
[104:04.96]I've already been over here.
[104:11.57]Lots of shotgun shells.
[104:16.09]It's armor.
[104:18.25]What means armor?
[104:19.13]What's armor?
[104:22.74]Secret?
[104:25.98]What do I do with this?
[104:27.40]Uh... Don't go in the... Is that gonna light up?
[104:30.82]Is that gonna... It doesn't explode, right?
[104:32.12]No.
[104:32.18]Is he gonna bring it with me?
[104:34.91]Is he gonna bring it with me?
[104:36.89]No, I'm just gonna throw it in there.
[104:37.81]Just whip it in there.
[104:41.27]I don't know if that did anything.
[104:48.82]Here comes a fight.
[104:54.60]If I can climb any wall...
[105:08.89]Hold on, I need to make... I'm not gonna do this yet.
[105:10.53]I wanna get stuff.
[105:12.87]Oh, fuck, whatever, just... Finally.
[105:23.93]Okay, um... Just make sure I don't miss anything.
[105:33.51]Smelly crystal... I don't know what these... I don't know what these do.
[105:39.62]Okay, I probably need to get up there.
[105:41.42]Is that soap?
[105:46.26]No.
[105:51.71]Hello?
[105:53.29]What the hell just happened?
[106:00.20]That's a backflip.
[106:09.15]Nothing else I can do?
[106:10.15]No.
[106:13.79]Just go.
[106:30.46]Good.
[106:31.14]Good.
[106:32.54]Do a flip.
[106:33.96]I told you I could do a backflip.
[106:36.28]Have I ever proven that?
[106:39.42]No, no, I actually can't do it anymore.
[106:41.44]Absolutely cannot do it anymore.
[106:53.29]Too old to do it?
[106:53.85]Yeah, I... Yes, I'm too old to do that.
[106:57.59]Without a doubt.
[106:59.79]I'm certain that I'm too old.
[107:05.49]Alright, now I can use my sword if I need it.
[107:09.53]I'm gonna go back down.
[107:10.81]We're gonna... Not fucking around with that.
[107:25.14]No loot?
[107:27.20]How dare you.
[107:36.54]I could go up a little higher, I think.
[107:37.62]Yeah, I can.
[107:49.87]The crossbow is a lot of fun.
[107:58.40]Oh, drunk fighting.
[108:03.58]I was too drunk to hit me.
[108:06.75]I don't know how that works.
[108:09.73]That makes no sense what I just said.
[108:19.86]Blue key.
[108:21.04]Blue door over there?
[108:33.16]What the hell?
[108:35.12]Oh, that's the door!
[108:36.37]That's the blue door!
[108:38.97]Okay.
[108:41.23]Right.
[108:42.09]Now I can just go this way.
[109:08.06]Adam.
[109:08.40]That guy fell to his death.
[109:09.20]I didn't have to do anything.
[109:11.23]Come on!
[109:11.69]Kill me!
[109:12.15]I'm here!
[109:12.69]Kill me!
[109:14.79]Boss fight incoming.
[109:16.59]Uh-huh.
[109:22.79]Three more of these to touch.
[109:24.91]I'm gonna get... Alright, let's do... What about mortars?
[109:27.85]Or sword, maybe.
[109:34.77]Rifle.
[109:35.49]Best weapon.
[109:36.23]The waves of destruction.
[109:40.44]Good to know.
[109:47.62]Any more writing?
[109:50.46]Two more to go.
[110:00.34]One more to go.
[110:05.59]This is a rifle.
[110:06.15]This is going to be a sniping level.
[110:07.91]That's much as certain.
[110:14.20]I think it's probably inside.
[110:31.86]The damning cooling gun.
[110:34.20]Cooling sun.
[110:48.02]Where is the... Did I miss one?
[110:52.14]I must have missed one.
[110:56.89]There it is.
[111:08.59]Oh!
[111:08.75]They're flying!
[111:29.21]It's hard to see my crosshair because it's snowy.
[111:31.81]It's very snowy.
[112:06.91]Jerma gave his older brother the controller.
[112:10.08]Yeah.
[112:11.50]Junko.
[112:13.96]Jerma's older brother.
[112:15.14]Junko.
[112:20.27]Junko.
[112:20.79]Alright, I got red key.
[112:23.85]I can go back down.
[112:25.03]Wait, did I miss anything?
[112:28.06]It's just fun to shoot in this game.
[112:29.54]It's very fun.
[112:30.34]It just is.
[112:31.88]Alright, let's go.
[112:43.24]There's a red door down here.
[112:45.30]Somewhere.
[112:45.70]I don't know.
[112:47.70]Whatever, wherever it is.
[112:48.62]It's back this way.
[112:54.15]I think it's back here.
[112:59.20]Right?
[112:59.52]No, where is it?
[113:00.48]No, where was it?
[113:01.67]No, it was back here.
[113:04.99]Don't worry, just leap.
[113:06.63]My, oh my fucking god, that scared the shit out of me.
[113:11.33]I was about to say, to have no fear, Junko will save the day.
[113:23.27]That's a one-hit kill.
[113:25.43]Good to know.
[113:29.61]Holy shit.
[113:30.82]It's one of those monsters.
[113:32.12]Just stand still.
[113:32.64]It's going to hit.
[113:33.16]Should I do it?
[113:37.54]Yeah.
[113:58.76]true hard run but have no saves sure I guess but the true hard mode is also take one hit of damage and you die actually that's not even actually what that mode is for this is the hardest game mode in the game that I'm on right now the one above it is a challenge mode it's a challenge mode specifically challenge mode so
[114:29.55]It is true.
[114:32.89]This is the hardest difficulty of the regular game.
[114:35.07]Why are all the people dead over here?
[114:49.28]Well, this isn't going to be fun.
[114:50.76]Actually, it is going to be fun.
[114:51.76]I like the ones where you can just ski around.
[115:02.72]Can I open these?
[115:03.32]This door opens elsewhere.
[115:04.34]Let's go.
[115:10.80]Well, I know you exist now.
[115:11.88]That's good.
[115:13.58]Who's talking?
[115:15.00]What did I do?
[115:31.00]I'm not gonna use those bullets, might as well use them for that.
[115:32.88]Hold on, gimme this stuff.
[115:37.32]Go down the well?
[115:40.35]Ooh, hold on.
[115:42.47]There's all kinds of little things to look at.
[115:45.55]This one opens.
[116:00.16]Where is he?
[116:00.52]Up top.
[116:00.94]Yep.
[116:08.60]WHAT THE FLYING FUCK!
[116:11.17]Fuck!
[116:26.25]Quit edgeguarding me!
[116:27.29]Was this Smash Brothers?
[116:28.94]Not fair!
[116:43.13]What am I doing?
[116:44.01]Alright, I'm good.
[116:46.34]Oh, I can open these doors from the other side.
[116:48.48]Alright, let's go.
[116:49.44]God damn it!
[116:51.82]The sound!
[116:56.26]It hurts.
[117:00.05]It hurts.
[117:00.75]It really does hurt.
[117:01.93]I could just get these all open.
[117:14.11]Give me that.
[117:15.31]My armpits are itchy right now after that.
[117:19.03]I don't know.
[117:19.49]Is there any doctors in here that can tell me why that is?
[117:25.16]Why do I have itchy armpits after being scared?
[117:32.28]Wait.
[117:32.96]It looks like I can jump off the ladder, you doofus.
[117:54.21]I don't want to be up there because I can see.
[117:56.07]There's the red door.
[118:02.51]I can get that gun.
[118:03.89]There's an extra sword.
[118:05.03]If you already have a sword, what's the point?
[118:15.71]Alright.
[118:18.40]Rifle.
[118:20.04]Let's just use it.
[118:22.03]I think we're clear.
[118:22.69]I thought that was yellow.
[118:24.63]Oh, that's a red door and then a... Alright, red door and then red door.
[118:27.16]Here we go.
[118:31.30]I... There was no reason for that to happen.
[118:33.42]There was no reason for what just happened to happen.
[118:35.42]You know what I'm saying?
[118:36.82]There was no reason for that.
[118:37.69]I don't have any morale.
[118:39.47]I'm dead.
[118:40.17]What the fuck?
[118:48.46]I'll just grab the key and it'll instantly scream in front of me.
[118:50.97]Guy!
[118:51.35]Ooh.
[118:54.07]Alright, well, I've got to be aware of that.
[118:56.91]Shit.
[119:00.93]Give me this health.
[119:12.58]Sacrifice.
[119:16.56]Alright.
[119:20.19]That's my ammo that I wanted.
[119:21.81]And I fell.
[119:24.93]Alright, kill that guy.
[119:26.31]Wait.
[119:26.95]What's in there?
[119:27.37]There's shit in there.
[119:35.44]Don't get that key.
[119:36.76]Get in there.
[119:37.30]What's in here?
[119:48.12]Not bad.
[119:49.32]Shotgun.
[119:49.84]I need a big shotgun.
[119:50.90]Alright.
[120:01.39]I've got plenty of ammo.
[120:02.39]I think it's time to start this.
[120:05.31]What do I have for my, uh, hunting rifle?
[120:07.45]Not 15.
[120:08.09]I want 15.
[120:10.87]I refuse to play unless I have 15 hunting rifle ammo.
[120:13.71]It's the only way I feel comfortable.
[120:18.44]Plus, I will not do all this.
[120:27.42]I need to do ammo collection now, because I won't do it later.
[120:31.09]Y'all know it.
[120:38.49]That looks suspicious.
[120:42.13]Alright.
[120:43.88]Wait.
[120:44.10]Alright, let's go.
[120:55.09]Wait.
[120:57.87]There's so many little nooks and crannies here.
[121:07.32]What does this do?
[121:09.06]A house opens.
[121:10.00]Which house?
[121:12.04]A house opened?
[121:13.94]No, too many things.
[121:15.43]Which house opened?
[121:28.72]Is this house?
[121:44.02]I can go in here.
[121:47.86]What is this for?
[121:48.68]There's a lot of places to go here.
[121:56.63]I think this is the house, right?
[122:01.09]Was that the house that opened?
[122:04.98]I don't know.
[122:06.56]Maybe another day I'll figure it out.
[122:09.32]Let's go.
[122:12.68]Right off the bat.
[122:38.93]Jesus.
[122:43.27]How am I not hitting you?
[122:44.47]Oh, fuck.
[122:45.03]I forgot to quicksave it right before.
[122:46.57]Did I?
[122:46.79]No, I didn't.
[122:59.82]Kill me.
[123:00.36]Kill me.
[123:00.74]Kill me.
[123:01.12]Kill me.
[123:01.42]That was bad.
[123:05.55]I forgot about the guys in the air.
[123:07.68]Let's go
[123:50.69]Clean it up.
[123:51.09]That's how you get it done.
[124:13.66]Is it Junko or Jungo?
[124:15.56]Tell us before a civil war starts.
[124:20.09]No, it's Junko.
[124:22.33]Like junk.
[124:30.16]It's not Jungo.
[124:31.96]It's Junko.
[124:34.38]All the brothers Junko.
[124:41.17]Imagine your name was Junko.
[124:47.63]Like, junk.
[124:48.91]J-U-N-K.
[124:50.03]Junko.
[124:58.25]Like, junkie.
[124:59.79]No, not junkie.
[125:00.69]That's not... Junko is... That's fine.
[125:13.06]Give me this.
[125:14.18]Didn't even use the power-ups, either.
[125:26.24]Alright, it's time.
[125:27.46]I got a red key.
[125:32.75]You gonna play this one on me, huh?
[125:35.93]That's why I saved it.
[125:42.17]Red door is up here.
[125:48.91]Somewhere.
[125:49.39]Where is it?
[125:50.05]Up that way?
[125:50.53]I know there's a weird red door somewhere, like hanging out over here.
[126:00.23]Sure thing, I'll take a secret.
[126:02.15]Found the double shotgun.
[126:03.39]I'm so happy I went up here.
[126:06.25]I'd be naked without this.
[126:07.35]Alright, what is that red?
[126:13.64]There it is.
[126:15.70]Oh, really?
[126:17.34]Look at that guy over there.
[126:18.34]I'm just going to hide behind here.
[126:21.54]Of course, you're not going to show your face.
[126:25.04]You're dealing with Junko.
[126:29.75]I would pity you.
[126:30.37]I wanted to kill you without picking that up.
[126:41.97]I just killed somebody.
[126:44.09]What?
[126:52.65]There he is.
[126:53.13]I fucking could smell him.
[127:05.82]Big guy.
[127:09.70]Don't go in the well.
[127:11.20]Don't tell me what to do.
[127:14.80]I'm going to do it just because you told me not to.
[127:21.29]Well, we're in some shit, aren't we?
[127:48.13]Erratic.
[127:49.07]Erratic.
[127:50.77]Got him.
[128:02.72]This is the door that opened.
[128:08.52]I can climb any surface.
[128:11.52]Which thing do I climb?
[128:12.30]The tallest thing here.
[128:15.08]Where am I?
[128:15.58]No, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[128:16.68]Where's the tallest thing here?
[128:29.63]No, none of this matters.
[128:32.13]Oh.
[128:41.07]Do you drown in this game?
[128:59.69]What's all this down here?
[129:00.67]Can I- I'm gonna drown, alright.
[129:10.34]How do I get out of here?
[129:14.96]Monka.
[129:16.15]Uh-oh.
[129:18.03]Is this open?
[129:18.91]Oh, that- Oh, that's it!
[129:23.17]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[129:24.59]Out, out, out, out, out!
[129:26.11]He can't fit through here, right?
[129:30.37]Can he fit through this?
[129:58.99]hog.
[129:59.33]I gotta get further away.
[130:02.45]I wasn't gonna cheese that one.
[130:20.02]I cheesed the last boss of the other encounter.
[130:22.82]I can't just... Come on.
[130:34.50]There's the yellow key.
[130:36.46]The shadow sunk our city.
[130:39.15]His monsters stripped our bones.
[130:45.01]The water rises.
[130:56.66]The bones are their dollars.
[131:11.62]Wait, the whole... Like, I can swim around.
[131:16.68]Alright, this sucks, but this is actually kind of cool.
[131:34.50]Swimming around.
[131:35.24]Alright, let me get that health.
[131:42.88]Bomb the wall.
[131:43.78]Bomb the wall.
[131:44.74]Bomb the wall.
[131:47.12]What wall?
[131:51.60]Which wall do you want me to bomb?
[131:57.61]Bomb the wall.
[131:58.47]The wall.
[132:00.09]In the wall.
[132:00.79]The wall.
[132:01.21]Alright, bye.
[132:02.69]You had your one chance to tell me where it was.
[132:07.89]And you had to be funny about it.
[132:09.07]You had to be cute about it.
[132:26.34]One of those.
[132:30.98]Fishes now.
[132:33.36]And they're fast.
[132:42.75]What a dodge.
[132:43.17]Did you see that dodge on his part?
[132:50.97]One fish, two fish, red fish, dead fish.
[132:57.03]I don't think that's how the Dr. Seuss book goes.
[133:11.32]I can hold my breath for a very long time.
[133:17.74]Fishmoly.
[133:18.58]Why you kill me?
[133:23.89]Is anybody else convinced that Fishmoly is like 29x29 instead of 28x28?
[133:27.63]The emote is bigger.
[133:28.19]Did it win?
[133:52.99]Are you winning?
[133:54.13]Crypt of the... Embrace the darkness.
[133:57.92]More of this.
[134:00.90]No, I don't like not having... Okay, sword time.
[134:05.22]No, super shocking.
[134:06.06]I hear a new enemy type.
[134:07.07]I hear breathing.
[134:22.46]I already got the yellow key.
[134:32.74]Alright, we win.
[134:36.10]I need my flashlights.
[135:00.35]The door opens somewhere else.
[135:13.68]The yellow door is right behind me!
[135:29.28]Okay, this is dead end.
[135:36.70]The basement door opened.
[135:37.74]Okay, red key is up here.
[135:46.75]Ah!
[135:50.17]What's this?
[135:50.81]Can I blow it up?
[136:03.99]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[136:14.61]I hate this sound.
[136:17.25]I hate the sounds.
[136:19.41]I hate the sounds.
[136:20.03]I knew it, there's a new monster.
[136:21.67]I told you it was a new monster.
[136:22.81]It's a big scary, like big mouth frog guy.
[136:45.70]It's so stressful.
[136:46.64]What is... okay.
[136:50.31]Go get this shit.
[136:54.39]Shotgun shells.
[136:56.01]Thanks.
[136:57.47]I guess.
[137:06.96]Looks like we're going in here.
[137:19.07]I knew it the chaos enthralls us the chaos crawls to me Jesus Christ I look how much damage these things do
[137:47.78]You guys are the worst.
[137:51.90]What does that do?
[137:53.78]Uh, it's a kind of way to go back?
[138:21.52]I was trying to pre-fire him.
[138:23.41]I have 30... I have 20 health.
[138:40.72]Wrong way.
[138:41.12]I'm dead.
[138:51.43]Whoa.
[138:53.51]That was tricky.
[139:02.92]Where's a flashlight?
[139:05.34]I already have a sword.
[139:07.00]Why does it want me to use the sword?
[139:07.98]I don't have enough morale to use the sword.
[139:09.38]I don't have enough morale for this.
[139:13.65]I need to use a...
[139:20.35]Who's in this one?
[139:21.21]Anybody?
[139:21.51]Can I just close myself in here?
[139:43.22]That's your secret?
[139:44.36]Your secret is shotgun shells?
[139:46.80]That's not a very good secret.
[140:04.69]Don't tell anybody about my secret.
[140:13.23]I'm getting closer to him.
[140:16.87]He's gonna run down the hall.
[140:18.16]He's gonna run down this hall.
[140:20.22]Might as well make it... There's not even a hallway.
[140:31.40]We're...
[140:34.32]Wait!
[140:35.04]Wait!
[140:35.44]What?
[140:36.14]Wait!
[140:36.76]Wait!
[140:37.24]Wait!
[140:38.06]Wait!
[140:38.64]Time out!
[140:39.04]Time out!
[140:39.48]Time out!
[140:40.45]Time out!
[140:40.75]It's not a frog.
[140:41.41]It's one of the invisible ones.
[140:42.49]Time out!
[140:54.17]They're down here though.
[141:03.81]It's definitely... I can't use that shit.
[141:06.99]It's gonna kill me.
[141:07.70]I'm gonna end up blowing myself up.
[141:08.92]Is there a chest right here?
[141:11.40]No.
[141:11.56]I don't have a key.
[141:33.27]No!
[141:40.00]There's something else to do here.
[141:41.40]I need to get the blue key.
[141:44.16]Up?
[141:45.22]I guess I could go up.
[141:48.58]Up there?
[142:01.53]no did I go this way I've been this way did I miss something else very clearly I can still hear that guy breathing did I not go in one of these doors
[142:31.66]What the fuck?
[142:33.03]Where?
[142:33.51]Where is he?
[142:41.45]God.
[142:42.07]This is not supposed to be a scary game.
[142:48.53]This is not supposed to be a scary game.
[143:05.00]There's the flashlight.
[143:05.96]There's the key.
[143:06.70]And I'm going to get swarmed the second I turn around.
[143:10.41]I'm going to spam mortars up the door.
[143:37.48]Safe.
[143:38.54]For now.
[143:46.93]I really don't like this level.
[143:49.21]It's too scary.
[143:50.77]It's too much.
[143:51.59]Can I blow that up?
[144:04.04]The ladder there.
[144:11.72]Well, I'm gonna use it if you want me to.
[144:13.29]Huh?
[144:32.18]Where is he?
[144:33.36]Where is he?
[144:33.84]Where the fuck?
[144:34.64]He came all the way down the stairs and I didn't even see him.
[144:36.64]Now I got 12 health.
[144:48.46]Never mind.
[144:48.94]I got more.
[144:49.38]I'm good.
[144:50.39]Deeper!
[144:52.23]Not yet.
[144:54.73]Hold that thought.
[144:55.67]Not deeper.
[145:10.19]That opens somewhere else.
[145:11.25]That's definitely the door that opens when I press this button.
[145:17.16]Don't fall.
[145:21.04]Deeper!
[145:21.52]I got stuck in the wall.
[145:25.46]Fucking Kermit the Frog over here.
[145:30.86]Kermit the Frog is going to kill me.
[145:39.80]Alright, so let's get this going.
[145:43.89]I'm going for it.
[145:44.85]I'm going to move quick.
[146:11.99]Oh, she spits!
[146:20.58]Where are you?
[146:23.52]Who's left?
[146:23.90]There's somebody left, apparently.
[146:28.04]Where?
[146:30.89]Where are they?
[146:31.41]I have 14 health.
[146:32.31]Where are you?
[147:01.12]That's not health.
[147:03.12]Oh, man.
[147:04.00]Oh, man.
[147:05.72]Oh, man.
[147:12.31]Oh, man.
[147:12.95]Oh, man.
[147:13.27]Oh, man.
[147:13.59]Oh, man.
[147:32.02]Where?
[147:35.64]Where is he?
[147:36.21]What is it?
[147:36.89]What's chasing me?
[147:46.65]Give me all that stuff.
[147:51.88]I gotta use the assault rifle.
[147:53.42]Max ammo on it.
[147:54.46]Always use the thing you have that has max ammo.
[147:56.10]That's a tip from a professional video game player.
[148:05.55]See?
[148:14.31]There's my key.
[148:15.91]Super health.
[148:16.45]That's the red key for the red door.
[148:20.79]The Owlclove opens.
[148:28.63]Where's the Owlclove?
[148:30.61]You want to help me out here?
[148:39.12]It's above you.
[148:40.52]Oh.
[148:46.43]Wait, is there a secret up there?
[148:48.21]No.
[148:52.49]The Owl Clove opens.
[149:02.20]Oh, you idiot.
[149:21.65]That's convenient.
[149:51.71]That's convenient.
[149:54.77]That's convenient.
[150:03.81]Alright.
[150:08.99]Didn't find a secret?
[150:15.11]I got a couple of them.
[150:20.96]Is that Beavis or Butthead?
[150:26.90]Both of them at the same time.
[150:28.98]Uh-oh.
[150:29.98]Open environment.
[150:31.64]It's time to show off our skills.
[150:46.19]You missed a secret.
[150:47.37]I don't care.
[150:51.12]I shouldn't have done that.
[150:52.87]Uh-oh, here comes the army.
[150:55.49]Sword only.
[150:56.47]Just kidding.
[150:56.85]That's a lie.
[151:05.76]I was going to say, Burger King frog?
[151:10.22]There's no Burger King frog, right?
[151:26.46]Okay, that's wave one.
[151:28.86]That's activated.
[151:29.58]Cool.
[151:30.92]Okay.
[152:03.27]Okay.
[152:04.57]Okay.
[152:09.37]Hey, why don't you make it hard for me?
[152:41.98]I mean, you didn't read the biography of my character beforehand.
[152:45.46]Unfortunately.
[152:47.60]You didn't read the biography that says, like, oh, watch out when he gets the sniper rifle.
[152:50.43]Don't go at him.
[152:51.83]He's fucking lit.
[152:54.43]Lit the sniper rifle.
[152:58.79]I got hit once.
[152:59.51]Yeah, oh, boog.
[153:00.55]I got hit one time.
[153:01.51]I was at 99 percentile.
[153:12.17]I actually like this.
[153:12.79]This is fun.
[153:13.23]Alright, let's do it with the crossbow.
[153:25.46]What's hitting me?
[153:26.22]Oh, what happened?
[153:27.28]Okay, that was bullshit.
[153:29.20]I didn't even see them.
[153:31.16]I didn't even see them.
[153:34.34]The problem is, I mean, what was I thinking?
[153:36.84]That's the problem right here.
[153:49.21]These things are following me around in a circle.
[153:52.31]Let's get some health.
[154:16.95]Good.
[154:17.61]Over here, health.
[154:21.72]Alright.
[154:23.22]Cool.
[154:24.43]Let's do some mortars.
[154:28.97]Good job, Jeremy, you fucking stupid dipshit idiot.
[154:34.79]Okay, I got everything I needed.
[154:39.89]Let's just activate the last one.
[154:46.85]What about in the cathedral area itself?
[154:48.61]I think there's probably some things I didn't get.
[154:56.00]Yeah, there's some health back here.
[154:57.22]Just making sure I get it all.
[154:58.67]Alright, last one.
[155:00.69]Where is it?
[155:06.41]Mod that guy?
[155:08.23]No.
[155:09.13]Don't mod that person.
[155:10.21]There's no reason to.
[155:18.07]It's not that one.
[155:18.75]I already got that one back here.
[155:30.27]No, I got this one too, where is it?
[155:37.68]There it is
[156:20.16]Open!
[156:27.47]It's time for the final battle.
[156:30.11]Whatever the hell's in here.
[156:30.97]Something's in here.
[156:35.96]Lots of shotgun ammo.
[156:40.40]There it is.
[156:41.02]Alright, I think... I think this is gonna throw ten times what I've done already at me right now.
[156:47.55]When I press this button.
[156:57.52]Shoot this?
[157:08.57]I did it.
[157:09.17]The rising wind brings the stench of rotten meat.
[157:17.33]Yeah?
[157:23.29]Okay.
[157:23.67]Should I get out of here?
[157:28.33]Oh, no.
[157:29.59]That's a...
[157:38.39]How do I get away from the tornado?
[157:43.10]It's coming for me!
[157:43.75]Do I have to leave the area?
[158:13.81]Let's go.
[158:14.93]Where is it?
[158:16.20]Okay, I have to go around it?
[158:24.44]It's changing trajectory?
[158:27.30]It's changing trajectory.
[158:28.80]Oh shit.
[158:30.02]Kill it?
[158:30.54]You can't kill a tornado.
[158:33.86]Oh my fucking god.
[158:36.20]No, I have to go around it.
[158:43.45]You can't kill a tornado!
[158:44.65]There's a way down.
[158:50.77]Alright, here we go.
[159:07.64]Why does it know where I'm going?
[159:21.31]Hurry up and go down!
[159:22.21]Wait, is there any secrets in there?
[159:30.37]It's gone.
[159:30.69]Wait, this is what I was supposed to do!
[159:40.69]I thought I... That's what I was supposed to do?
[159:49.18]I thought I was supposed to escape the tornado!
[159:58.36]Oh, alright.
[160:02.51]I'm trying to get all this stuff.
[160:05.95]I didn't know that was what I was supposed to do.
[160:08.85]I thought I was running away from the tornado.
[160:11.19]What is that?
[160:11.65]A magic egg?
[160:16.39]Backpack full of ammo.
[160:21.26]Oh dear, I had 50 health.
[160:26.82]I just fell off.
[160:43.69]Okay, well that's a lot of you coming up.
[160:45.57]Okay, that's a lot of you coming up right now.
[160:55.04]This thing pushes you back.
[161:02.13]I'm gonna get him.
[161:02.59]When I get up there, he's fucking dead.
[161:03.89]I'm gonna kill him.
[161:04.83]I'm gonna kick his ass.
[161:05.73]I'm gonna stab his throat.
[161:07.09]And when I get up there, it's you.
[161:10.35]Funny.
[161:10.83]Fuck.
[161:12.29]I didn't have any morale.
[161:29.34]I thought I had enough morale to do that.
[161:31.60]Oh, well.
[161:32.06]You thought it was, like, funny.
[161:34.15]You win.
[162:08.13]Where is he?
[162:10.86]I'm just shooting a shotgun from this far away.
[162:23.56]Shooting the fucking ground.
[162:25.12]This guy's freaking me out.
[162:34.10]Why does he not run up yet?
[162:35.84]Alright.
[162:36.38]Okay.
[162:36.94]Here we go.
[162:40.20]He kills me again.
[162:49.66]Sometimes you gotta just go in.
[163:02.75]Good.
[163:03.17]Alright.
[163:03.75]Now we've got a door here.
[163:05.81]We've got a secret spot here.
[163:09.13]No.
[163:39.45]You take a lot of hits.
[163:40.49]It's alright though.
[163:41.45]Save it right here.
[163:42.21]Get in.
[163:42.49]I don't have a fucking morale!
[163:47.20]Just kill me!
[163:47.96]I thought I had- Why did I lose morale?
[163:50.52]49 morale who?
[163:54.32]That doesn't give me morale.
[163:55.58]Why are you even putting it on your bar?
[164:14.53]Now I got morale.
[164:15.63]Give me that.
[164:31.06]Give me that.
[164:32.86]Well, I didn't find it, because I can't get it.
[164:34.62]I mean, sure, I found it, but I can't reach in there and get it.
[164:40.91]Get out of the way.
[165:12.75]I thought these were flush the whole way.
[165:14.96]I thought they, I thought they were flush.
[165:17.96]Every time I looked at it, it was, like, that right there, this is connected right there.
[165:21.70]I'm moving around quickly, and I thought it was connected.
[165:25.00]Whatever.
[165:26.90]It's fine.
[165:30.26]Alright, where am I going?
[165:31.82]Uh, get the super pistols?
[165:35.88]Not yet.
[165:38.14]Alright, super pistols, and over the door, go.
[165:42.37]There's nothing even here to do this with.
[165:43.59]Okay, keep going.
[165:45.05]Find something to do.
[165:45.81]Find something to kill quick.
[165:46.93]Find somebody to shoot at.
[165:49.49]Find anybody.
[165:51.32]Got him.
[166:06.53]I still don't have any keys.
[166:16.96]Did I miss a key?
[166:17.82]Wait, do I have a key?
[166:18.74]No.
[166:22.19]Oh, there's a door.
[166:28.50]Would have loved that fucking special movie!
[166:49.52]I was absolutely deranged.
[166:51.78]Yeah, I know.
[166:52.50]What did it say?
[166:59.99]What am I going to tell you?
[167:01.83]Sorry?
[167:02.23]I was in the middle of talking.
[167:12.38]I was like, oh, that's going to be... And then somebody just grabbed my sides and squeezed really hard.
[167:19.43]A squeaky toy.
[167:29.66]Red key!
[167:46.12]What happened?
[167:47.10]Why did I put it away?
[167:48.31]Why are they freaking me out?
[167:49.87]Which way are they going?
[167:50.97]Okay, I gotta slow down.
[167:51.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[167:52.55]Why are they taking all the sickles?
[167:54.35]Why are the sickles out?
[167:56.29]Okay, I'm so glad I saved it.
[167:58.38]Seriously, why is a sickle coming out?
[168:02.97]What was that all about?
[168:03.97]I, like, took this out and then all of a sudden the sickles got replaced.
[168:07.53]I lost all the health I had.
[168:09.01]That's so... So... I'm actually upset right now, but it's alright.
[168:17.49]Well, that's what the problem was.
[168:18.47]Alright.
[168:20.85]If you don't... If there's zero ammo in your gun, if you click, it just switches immediately to the next one.
[168:25.11]That was the problem.
[168:25.75]That's when I got all fucked up.
[168:47.32]Where are these fools?
[168:52.76]You fool.
[168:56.46]That was fucking really fast!
[169:12.93]Anybody else play video games here?
[169:19.83]Wait, I don't want to go through that yet.
[169:21.69]Wasn't there a red one up here?
[169:22.53]I remember there being a red door and me going, red door.
[169:32.12]Secret red door or something, right?
[169:33.84]Or am I making that up?
[169:35.82]No, I told you I wasn't making it up.
[169:47.14]Riveter unlocked.
[169:53.79]I'm not going that way yet.
[170:06.34]This is just a... That's the door I was thinking of.
[170:08.98]Okay.
[170:13.02]Nothing in the crossbow.
[170:14.02]Hunting rifle.
[170:14.68]Let's just move.
[170:20.12]This game is cool.
[170:21.06]Laugh my ass off.
[170:21.85]Yeah, I know.
[170:29.93]Let it come through.
[170:31.17]Three, two, one, go.
[170:36.20]What the hell?
[170:36.62]What was that?
[170:45.61]Don't watch it come all the way down, dummy.
[171:05.77]I knew he was right here.
[171:08.25]There's like four of them here.
[171:26.92]I have to start using these.
[171:28.16]Always use the one with max ammo.
[171:34.01]And then collect ammo.
[171:35.49]And then fight a boss with 40 health.
[171:38.29]Sounds like a plan to me.
[171:38.97]Oh.
[171:55.50]You didn't even check behind the portal.
[171:57.46]Ugh, I know.
[172:01.02]The effects of the fast fire totem will stack.
[172:08.86]So what you're saying is... Pistols, get both fast fire things and just go spam.
[172:15.26]I'll take it.
[172:32.52]Where am I?
[172:33.12]Okay.
[172:34.80]Where am I?
[172:35.12]WHERE AM I?
[172:35.48]WHAT'S THAT?
[172:41.18]Alright, we're good.
[172:43.28]I gotta stop drinking coffee.
[172:49.50]Save it.
[172:55.96]I know more large coffees.
[172:57.26]I thought that was a guy.
[172:59.22]Alright, hold on.
[173:07.81]Where are these motherfuckers?
[173:13.93]Yeah, good.
[173:14.29]You got your cameo.
[173:15.63]You gotta be on camera.
[173:18.07]There we go.
[173:34.94]Alright.
[173:43.63]I still hear somebody.
[173:46.41]There's a lot of stuff in the way, though.
[173:47.70]There's a lot of things to pick up and a lot of places to go.
[173:50.38]Why don't we check out down here?
[173:53.12]Look at that.
[173:54.28]Super bullets or something.
[173:55.76]I don't know.
[173:56.54]Okay, I'll take it.
[173:57.48]Sure, what's up there?
[173:58.52]Who cares?
[174:00.52]Welcome to hell!
[174:21.41]I have bees?
[174:28.32]What's that?
[174:29.88]Another sword?
[174:42.61]I can go down here, can't I?
[174:46.68]Oh, shit.
[174:47.50]Okay.
[174:48.22]There's something-
[174:52.09]Red door.
[174:52.85]Wait, that's not a red door.
[174:53.95]Yes, it is.
[174:54.21]I have a red key.
[174:54.77]What are you, dumb?
[175:14.08]Back in the back of my mouse hole.
[175:15.36]Back in the mouse hole.
[175:22.35]Alright, too many of them got... They got killed by a creeper.
[175:37.37]My god.
[175:50.00]Fuck.
[175:51.54]Okay, go up.
[175:54.40]Look at how much that is there.
[175:57.06]But wait.
[176:04.35]What the hell?
[176:06.39]What?
[176:08.41]Is there a reason why I'm opening all these doors at the same time?
[176:11.03]Like a dope?
[176:31.05]You can't be serious with me.
[176:33.13]What?
[177:03.04]Retreat!
[177:15.16]Ooh.
[177:16.68]What is in here?
[177:25.48]I shot over his head.
[177:33.20]You got lucky.
[177:35.44]You, on the other hand, are still alive.
[177:37.04]Blue key.
[177:50.07]I'm kind of running out of ammo.
[178:19.04]I need every bit of health I can get right now.
[178:22.74]And there's still those guys here.
[178:25.01]The frogs are still here somewhere.
[178:31.47]I can't slide under there?
[178:45.52]Alright, fuck it, whatever.
[178:46.54]I think I'm just gonna go.
[178:51.67]I hate hearing that breathing sound.
[178:53.69]The heavy breathing.
[178:55.77]It drives me crazy because I know somebody's here.
[179:06.22]There's health in this ammo right here.
[179:08.24]Just fuck it.
[179:08.96]Let's just rain health.
[179:25.81]Sure, I guess.
[179:26.75]Whatever.
[179:34.23]Where is it?
[179:35.75]Where are you?
[179:38.45]I can hear his, like, stretchy pants.
[179:40.83]Can you hear him?
[179:45.69]He's wearing, like, spandex.
[179:47.13]Hey, you're the coolest fucking person I know.
[179:52.93]You're the coolest person.
[179:56.99]Just step on the gas, like, all the way down, and let, like, fill your engine with, flood your engine with gas, and just go really fast for five seconds.
[180:06.86]It's so awesome.
[180:07.74]Like, you're so cool for doing that.
[180:11.26]Oh, everything about you, like, I wish I could meet you, and hang out with you.
[180:18.89]I, you know, I would assume that that person speaks in one-word sentences.
[180:22.71]Yeah.
[180:24.49]You like going real fast, huh?
[180:26.01]Yes.
[180:27.17]Okay.
[180:32.09]You know, that's like, you completely, like, hurt somebody.
[180:34.21]I don't know.
[180:37.47]Oh, okay.
[180:48.20]But I go fast.
[180:50.28]Cool.
[180:50.80]Great.
[180:54.38]I hate sharing the road with you.
[181:03.44]This place is condemned.
[181:08.09]Oh, there he is.
[181:08.75]Whoa.
[181:09.55]Don't look at me.
[181:12.65]Don't look at me.
[181:13.13]Don't look at me.
[181:13.65]I don't have any clothes on.
[181:17.73]Where are my clothes?
[181:18.81]This is a nightmare.
[181:19.73]I'm in a nightmare.
[181:40.41]It's doing the, like, super pog face.
[181:44.40]I'm gonna die.
[181:45.30]I have to... Okay, what do I want to use?
[181:47.18]Hunting rifle?
[181:47.80]There's another one down here.
[181:48.74]I think it's right behind the door.
[182:16.54]I knew it!
[182:23.87]I knew it!
[182:24.19]I knew you were here!
[182:29.91]Is he dead?
[182:30.35]He's dead.
[182:31.29]There's another one though.
[182:32.15]Oh shit.
[182:33.41]Is that right there?
[182:35.87]Oh no!
[182:36.73]Not this stuff.
[182:37.89]Not like this.
[182:38.65]Alright, shotgun time.
[182:50.63]Alright, I'm gonna put... I'm gonna block the doors.
[182:53.31]So he can't go around me.
[182:57.19]He cannot go in front of me.
[182:58.43]He can only come to my left and right.
[183:00.67]No, just my left.
[183:01.69]He can't go through that front door.
[183:09.69]Welcome back.
[183:13.79]Oh boy.
[183:14.64]Okay, well...
[183:26.57]I know this is only for bosses, but there's rivets here.
[183:28.33]That's enough.
[183:39.21]Holy shit, you were right there.
[183:44.53]The health in there?
[183:45.29]Oh, shit.
[183:46.71]I don't even... Where am I going?
[183:51.57]Oops.
[183:52.20]Where am I?
[183:54.38]How do I...
[184:05.93]God damn it, man.
[184:08.63]God damn it.
[184:12.18]Wait, it was just a chainsaw guy.
[184:14.18]It wasn't even a frog.
[184:15.92]It wasn't even a frog.
[184:17.76]I can kill these guys in one shot.
[184:20.68]Seriously, that was what I was scared of?
[184:23.78]That's what I was so scared of.
[184:25.98]Unbelievable.
[184:27.99]It's not even a frog.
[184:33.52]But seriously, though, um... I'm gonna do mortars.
[184:37.98]Rivets for a little bit.
[184:40.08]Welcome back.
[184:42.62]Two, and then get you with two.
[184:45.56]And then get you with two.
[184:47.70]And then that's alright.
[184:49.68]You're here.
[184:50.36]You're right.
[184:51.16]Why would I shoot myself in the face with this?
[184:53.75]Don't ask me.
[184:54.31]I can't give you an answer.
[184:56.94]Alright.
[184:58.08]Let's move.
[185:02.66]There's one in here.
[185:15.11]Good.
[185:19.77]I need to do the slows.
[185:20.97]I want the health.
[185:24.73]Rivet's right there.
[185:25.61]I know you're gonna...
[185:29.99]Are you serious?
[185:31.52]Ch- Turn!
[185:32.22]Why aren't you turning?
[185:33.38]Turn!

[186:34.60]I don't like when they do this shit.
[186:36.54]It's too scary.
[186:37.50]I have no idea if this is the right way.
[186:48.53]No, I just...
[187:02.53]You doing the hypercam guy voice?
[187:05.43]No, that's even the right way.
[187:06.75]I don't know.
[187:08.09]It could be.
[187:08.95]I don't know.
[187:11.03]Oh boy, this is where we move.
[187:25.08]Alright, somebody teleported though.
[187:30.10]Somebody teleported.
[187:31.18]I heard it.
[187:32.78]So when I go in there, I have to be ready.
[187:43.37]See?
[187:46.89]Where'd this put me?
[187:52.31]Alright, let's just go back.
[187:53.21]Uh, alright.
[187:56.53]What's up?
[187:57.01]I guess that this is the end.
[188:09.33]Pepe hands, what?
[188:17.10]See, I even checked behind it this time.
[188:18.98]Nothing on here.
[188:30.55]I'm very proud of you.
[188:36.03]Press any key.
[188:37.61]Homecoming!
[188:38.57]Alright, let's get the full health almost.
[188:52.54]Welcome home.
[188:56.40]Hold on, I need to, uh... I need to put back on my, um...
[189:03.23]my glued-on grip from the Razor Death Adder.
[189:07.09]Yeah.
[189:12.84]You know what I'm going to say.
[189:13.76]I don't even need to say it.
[189:17.80]You don't know.
[189:18.39]You don't even need to know what I'm going to say.
[189:20.53]You already have heard it before.
[189:23.93]If you're in the store, and there's two mice next to each other, one of them is a, like, $100 Razer DeathAdder, and the other one is, like, an Amazon Basics $12 mouse, that's the better one.
[189:43.69]Like, the default Microsoft mouse is better than this mouse.
[189:52.15]I'm serious.
[189:55.04]Imagine gluing on grips.
[189:57.60]Can you imagine that?
[190:01.54]And they can come off.
[190:08.08]Alright, I got everything I needed.
[190:15.84]Wait.
[190:18.17]I mean, I kinda need to try.
[190:33.19]Oops.
[190:33.95]I didn't hit it.
[190:38.75]Why am I not dead?
[190:45.34]What?
[190:48.60]Hey, thanks.
[190:50.58]Wait, I'm just...
[191:09.82]Oh, I got him!
[191:21.21]Nice.
[191:23.46]This is a secret.
[191:25.62]Is it really, though?
[191:30.72]Yeah, I know.
[191:31.10]I'm playing with bumpers.
[191:33.78]Yes, I'm at the bowling alley and I'm... What was that sound?
[191:37.55]I heard a sound.
[191:48.36]Wait, there's stuff to explore over there, though.
[191:52.20]I'm not... I don't wanna do this yet.
[191:53.04]I think this is like a... I activate that or something.
[191:55.66]Oh, it's that thing.
[192:06.79]Why use two when you can use four?
[192:14.11]Alright.
[192:14.53]What does this do?
[192:15.93]I feel like if I touch that, I'm gonna progress.
[192:19.64]I don't think I'm ready for progress right now.
[192:22.98]Yeah, not yet.
[192:23.52]Hold on.
[192:23.92]I got the key.
[192:27.85]I wanna go and see what's over there.
[192:47.89]Okay.
[192:53.95]There's a house here.
[193:02.84]Stop laughing at your own jokes.
[193:04.48]Yeah.
[193:07.00]I almost missed.
[193:11.00]You are not fun.
[193:20.16]Looking for health.
[193:21.42]I hear a little jingling of keys.
[193:28.68]Hey, any key jinglers here?
[193:30.58]Am I doing it right?
[193:35.30]Well, sorry to intrude.
[193:37.54]Giant ball of skulls and death that lives in a regular house.
[193:49.85]Alright, I know there's gonna be another one.
[193:52.69]What's in the basement?
[193:53.53]I don't know.
[194:04.60]There's something in here.
[194:06.24]Look, how very clearly there's... That's just a key.
[194:17.60]I think I'm supposed to touch all these.
[194:20.94]Why did I do that?
[194:22.58]No, touch it again.
[194:23.90]Touch it again, touch it again.
[194:24.68]I don't wanna do that.
[194:30.36]No, I didn't even get to see what was in the basement!
[194:34.14]No!
[194:34.69]I didn't get to see- No, I'll never know what's gonna be in the basement now.
[194:45.67]Where am I going?
[194:46.99]What the fuck is happening?
[194:51.45]Touch that!
[194:51.93]No, I didn't touch that!
[194:57.79]Okay.
[194:58.55]I gotta touch that one.
[194:59.53]I gotta grab this one.
[195:06.32]Okay.
[195:07.80]Go this way.
[195:10.08]And... Where is it?
[195:16.82]Oh.
[195:16.94]Is this door open?
[195:25.49]Oh shit, I missed it.
[195:27.11]Oh!
[195:27.29]I need to be normal again.
[195:39.00]Whoops, I... Where's the world?
[195:50.23]Okay, um...
[196:02.14]Load the save.
[196:05.46]It hurts my brain so bad.
[196:08.14]Just reach that.
[196:10.44]I can't even... I need to hit that again.
[196:14.47]I actually think I'm fucked.
[196:22.07]Somehow I'm moving further and further away.
[196:34.55]I think I can't do anything.
[196:46.30]I can't turn.
[196:47.00]I can't move.
[196:48.50]I can't.
[196:51.26]Wait, what?
[197:12.45]Um, okay, I need to see what's in the basement.
[197:44.81]What are you doing down here, man?
[197:51.63]There's nothing in here?
[197:54.55]I guess there was health down here.
[197:57.12]So it wasn't even worth coming down here.
[198:02.90]Why'd you do that, dude?
[198:03.68]He was just fucking vibing.
[198:07.26]Well... I don't... I don't... No.
[198:11.46]I don't care.
[198:13.30]Alright, now I'm gonna try to... I have the blue key.
[198:18.16]Here we go.
[198:18.64]Ready?
[198:21.50]Flip it.
[198:23.42]And then... Which way am I standing?
[198:25.06]Okay, this is the way I'm standing.
[198:27.18]We're going... Alright, where the hell am I?
[198:31.02]Alright, so... I need to get a button.
[198:40.13]So I'm no longer here.
[198:44.33]There's a button.
[198:45.83]Let's get hit by this tree.
[198:49.82]No!
[198:53.96]I almost had it.
[198:56.84]What about this one?
[198:57.70]Can I get hit by it?
[198:58.64]Let me get stuck here.
[198:59.48]Alright, I'm in a new house.
[199:08.89]I hear it.
[199:17.58]oops alright well okay now if I go there's a switch that I have to hit I saw it it was over here somewhere like right it's right there where is it where's that switch
[199:50.90]No, there was a, what the hell is that?
[199:53.32]Alright.
[200:16.30]In the barn is another switch, but that's just gonna make it right side up.
[200:19.57]I think I have to actually, like, travel around like this.
[200:31.33]Alright, where am I now?
[200:36.38]Can I get in the barn like this?
[200:39.56]Right there?
[200:39.94]Alright, I'm in the barn.
[200:55.13]Shit, no.
[200:56.69]I can't reach that.
[201:01.12]Or can I?
[201:11.08]No.
[201:13.14]Do a rivet jump?
[201:13.92]Ah, I just end up hurting myself and not hitting it.
[201:18.41]What happens if I go through here?
[201:20.35]Alright, there's that.
[201:22.45]But I'm not on the right plane.
[201:28.02]You know what I'm saying?
[201:28.86]I need to get, like, that way.
[201:30.60]So I gotta flip it.
[201:34.32]Shit.
[201:35.04]Can I... Can I get up there?
[201:38.12]Maybe I can.
[201:44.93]I'm almost lined up.
[201:50.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[201:52.05]I'm on this island now.
[201:53.85]But which way am I going?
[201:54.72]I gotta go...
[201:56.33]Not quite, not quite, not quite, not quite, not... Just don't move.
[202:13.81]I thought I got to hit that...
[202:29.57]What happens if I press this button, though?
[202:33.91]There's health here.
[202:39.81]Got it.
[202:40.11]Ah!
[202:45.51]What?
[202:47.91]What the fuck?
[202:51.72]What did it open?
[202:52.36]I don't even... I have no idea what it opened.
[202:55.82]Um... Where the hell am I?
[203:00.81]Holy shit, this is the most disorienting thing I've ever done.
[203:04.68]Which way am I even aiming?
[203:11.36]Alright, got one!
[203:14.92]I need to go right, so I'm gonna throw up.
[203:18.20]I'm gonna throw up.
[203:20.30]I have to hit this and spin around.
[203:23.74]I got one shot at this.
[203:26.82]I didn't get it.
[203:41.57]Alright.
[203:42.07]I... Blue!
[203:43.33]Blue!
[203:43.67]Blue!
[203:44.11]Blue!
[203:44.73]There's a blue... I'm at the blue door.
[204:03.68]Okay.
[204:06.20]Let's... Let's go.
[204:11.68]Oh, no.
[204:12.60]I don't want to... Do I have to press that?
[204:15.32]Oh, no.
[204:17.02]I... Do I have to press that?
[204:22.66]Do I have to?
[204:25.11]Wait, it's like there's two of them in here.
[204:29.01]Just... Ay-yi-yi.
[204:34.65]What is this?
[204:36.53]The neighboring garage opens.
[204:38.14]Don't do this yet.
[204:51.63]Why are these guys in here?
[204:55.29]How can I be... Hello?
[204:57.91]How can I be here?
[205:00.09]What's this screaming for?
[205:01.45]Somebody!
[205:07.96]Okay.
[205:22.19]Oh, man.
[205:23.91]So... What's the actual end goal here?
[205:33.50]What's the end game here?
[205:35.02]Computer?
[205:35.46]I don't have time to play with myself.
[205:38.06]No, I don't.
[205:42.16]Is it to get in the barn like this?
[205:46.83]Or...
[205:49.20]I'm not sure what this wants me to do.
[205:51.04]Let's see.
[205:51.76]Wait.
[205:52.06]Okay, I'm upside down now.
[205:55.03]This one just makes you go upside down.
[205:58.25]I know there's soap in there.
[205:59.07]Don't worry.
[206:00.45]So if I just go upside down, that means I have to get to the upside down one.
[206:05.32]Like this.
[206:08.72]I've made it.
[206:10.14]To this island.
[206:15.18]There's also another island that has stuff on it, like that one.
[206:18.57]No, where is it?
[206:20.23]Somewhere around here, isn't it?
[206:26.88]I know about that, but wasn't there another one of these?
[206:30.62]Smaller, with a bunch of stuff on it?
[206:33.28]Where was that?
[206:33.80]Oh, whatever.
[206:42.75]I'm trying to shoot.
[206:45.41]What?
[206:47.41]Where's my, uh... That's the one right there!
[206:50.06]That's what I'm looking for.
[206:50.66]Good thing this stopped.
[206:52.04]Do it again.
[206:59.90]Yeah, I knew there was one of these.
[207:03.97]There, see?
[207:04.33]Alright, that was worth doing.
[207:11.99]What about that?
[207:13.01]No.
[207:18.37]Okay.
[207:19.69]It's time.
[207:22.35]Just be ready.
[207:25.58]Oh, you bastard.

[207:33.00]Where is he?

[209:18.03]Almost perfected.
[209:20.35]I wasn't about to go try to find the third secret there.
[209:22.25]That was a puke level.
[209:31.08]As above, so below.
[209:32.02]This is the very beginning.

[212:03.79]10 levels per episode?
[212:05.35]Something like that?

[214:00.81]Alright, I want shotgun and mortars for my switches.
[214:38.48]Godlike.
[214:47.23]And then I go and do something like that.

[215:13.41]What was that?

[215:28.14]It's you!
[215:28.60]I just- I- I- I just saved it right there.

[216:23.56]But let me get everything.
[216:24.28]There's another person.
[216:36.83]Which house are they in?
[216:39.07]Are they in here with me?
[216:44.35]What?
[216:44.71]Open?
[216:45.99]What's the point of this?
[216:47.77]What's the point of that?
[216:49.96]What's the point of this?
[216:51.60]I don't think there's a point.
[216:55.42]Alright.
[217:19.45]Secret health, but I don't need it.
[217:20.59]Okay, I see where you are.
[217:32.55]I see where you are.
[217:37.28]Holy shit!
[217:45.62]Okay, we're just bombing it.
[217:53.63]Hello?
[218:02.11]What happened there?
[218:03.09]I got one, two, three.
[218:06.96]One, two, three.
[218:08.48]Great.
[218:10.74]Where were you?
[218:12.92]I don't... Guys, she was in the bottom floor of the house.
[218:19.61]How many times did I pass you?
[218:40.15]Did she blow up a tree?
[218:42.08]Well, something activated.
[218:43.16]Alright, don't go in here yet.
[218:48.68]I want to take care of this shit.
[218:52.68]Alright, let's get in here.
[218:54.66]Same deal.
[218:56.54]Now I can chill and vomit.
[219:03.91]That's gonna hurt me, isn't it?
[219:09.09]What the fuck just happened?
[219:12.85]What just happened?
[219:22.63]Fuck it, we're going in.
[219:27.42]How many people are in here?
[219:39.28]There's so many people in here!
[219:42.20]There's so many people!
[220:00.74]Alright.
[220:01.16]There's like three of those whispering ladies in here.
[220:08.08]Now, what does this get me?
[220:12.26]I heard a beep?
[220:17.90]Alright, interesting.
[220:35.54]Anything else in here?
[220:37.97]Wait, this just takes me all the way back to... Wait, what?
[220:44.83]Why would I want to come back here?
[220:54.76]This is the... Oh.
[220:57.50]What the fuck?
[221:00.89]Hold on.
[221:01.25]Itchy guy.
[221:04.01]No, that's right.
[221:04.53]That's where this yellow key is.
[221:05.72]Alright.
[221:06.98]Well, let's get the hell out of here.
[221:12.56]Guys, what is going on right now?
[221:14.00]Where the fuck am I going?
[221:19.59]What just happened?
[221:20.35]This is really, really far away.
[221:33.74]What?
[221:34.20]I'm so confused.
[221:35.50]This may as well have been six hours ago.
[221:37.30]Alright, here's the house.
[221:42.49]Alright, I made it.
[221:44.07]Alright, so that was not the way I should have... Okay, I have to get... Right, right, right.
[221:49.65]I gotta get the... I'm gonna go down here.
[222:08.58]I don't have very much time to use this.
[222:13.78]Is it just death down there?
[222:14.74]I think that you just die.
[222:17.04]Uh... Go find out.
[222:29.07]I'm not sure I'm supposed to do that.
[222:32.01]I mean, why would I be able to come all the way down here though?
[222:39.39]There's nowhere else to go.
[222:40.29]I knew it.
[222:45.02]I knew it.
[222:49.98]So what was the point of this?
[222:51.08]Was that a secret?
[222:51.98]I guess.
[223:11.28]He's answering himself.
[223:15.08]I guess I go... I didn't get a yellow key yet.
[223:24.01]And that's what I'm looking for.
[223:28.05]Was there a yellow key somewhere up here that I missed?
[223:30.53]Like through here?
[223:31.11]Because this wraps all the way around.
[223:34.29]Don't go down.
[223:35.93]Just go across.
[223:37.15]Alright, maybe this is the way to go.
[223:41.23]Trust your eyes.
[224:05.34]Now we're all the way back again where we were last time.
[224:14.96]I'm just going to rocket jump up.
[224:34.32]What the?
[224:34.74]Oh, it's the wrong button.
[224:35.58]Wrong one.
[224:36.28]It's this one.
[224:44.28]Keep moving.
[224:53.77]Mm-mm.
[224:55.75]So small.
[224:58.13]So powerless.
[225:12.61]Where are you?
[225:13.17]I can hear you.
[225:14.79]Or is he above me?
[225:15.57]There you are.
[225:23.49]Oh, and you came through the door.
[225:52.45]Making those things move a lot.
[226:14.37]Oh!
[226:14.77]He hit me right in the face.
[226:17.92]Jesus!
[226:22.64]This dog.
[226:36.33]Stress, stress, stress, stress, stress.
[226:39.65]Stress him out, stress him out, stress him out, stress him out, stress him out.
[226:45.52]What else we got?
[226:46.16]Anything, any more food here for me to, for my guns?
[226:48.20]Any more food for my guns?
[226:50.62]Yes, there is.
[226:52.18]And get this food gun.
[226:58.10]Max on hunting rifle.
[226:59.22]There we go.
[227:02.78]Wait, what's this?
[227:05.75]Weird little door back here.
[227:18.62]I can hear you wailing.
[227:21.73]There you are.
[227:49.43]This is a long stairway...
[227:56.86]What is this?
[227:57.82]A gas machine?
[228:01.27]I guess there's some stuff down here.
[228:04.11]Hey!
[228:10.19]Where is he?
[228:19.03]He's in the teleporter.
[228:20.11]Great.
[228:23.80]He's lining his shotgun up to my head.
[228:29.91]He was just waiting for me.
[229:01.43]Alright, give me a second.
[229:02.36]Well, I'm trying to... Didn't I get another key?
[229:05.74]I swear I did.
[229:08.34]Somebody's sprinting down here, I think.
[229:13.85]Maybe not.
[229:17.95]Alright, we're good.
[229:18.53]5G gum?
[229:29.62]I'm chewing 5G gum.
[229:40.83]That's real funny.
[229:44.19]I mean, just hilarious, dude.
[229:46.34]Absolutely hysterical.
[229:49.78]You're the funniest person.
[229:52.86]Hey, actually, it's a shortcut.
[229:53.78]Thanks for the shortcut.
[229:54.40]Appreciate it.
[230:12.30]Good.
[230:20.84]Sweet.
[230:21.12]You wanna play that game?
[230:31.55]I can play that game.
[230:39.53]Get outta here.
[230:41.89]Take that.
[230:44.35]Memories dry and crumble.
[230:54.62]This game's too hard for you?
[231:01.34]I'm about to finish the game on the hardest difficulty.
[231:07.00]What are you talking about?
[231:15.86]Nah, I think you should, like... I think you should, like, put a... You gotta throw in the towel, man.
[231:21.54]You're, like, 42 minutes from beating the whole game on the second hardest difficult... I think, you know, maybe you should throw in the towel now.
[231:28.14]This is time for you to throw in the towel.
[231:30.99]Man, now is it.
[231:31.93]Do it now.
[231:45.40]Where is it?
[231:48.56]Where the hell is he?
[231:50.35]He's freaking me out wherever he is.
[231:54.37]How did you even fit through the door?
[231:57.37]How did he even get in the door?
[232:07.46]Really?
[232:07.90]You can't fit through there, man.
[232:10.46]No way.
[232:11.64]You don't fit through that door.
[232:15.69]Let's go.
[232:37.59]Okay.
[232:42.02]Take out both of these.
[232:43.14]Alright, now watch out for the dog.
[232:55.37]I don't even know where he came from.
[233:01.41]He kind of just showed up.
[233:19.35]Where is he?
[233:20.35]He's gonna... ...through this wall.
[233:49.36]I'm gonna get you!
[233:51.16]OH!
[233:58.02]He can hit me through the... grate.
[234:06.14]Sorry, I just negated everything he just did.
[234:13.68]Stop commentating, just win the game.
[234:15.48]This streaming shit is distracting you!
[234:22.52]Alright, I'll turn my stream off for a few hours, guys.
[234:25.56]I'll see you later.
[234:28.65]Dude, you need to turn off your stream.
[234:36.49]Did I really just get a dude turn off your stream comment?
[234:39.53]Did that really just happen?
[234:45.70]Dude, just turn off your stream.
[234:53.84]Alright, hold on.
[234:54.54]I got... I'm ready to move forward.
[234:57.30]Dude, like, this stream of things, like, you gotta... Just... Complete the circle.
[235:07.01]I have to... But this is the beginning of the game.
[235:35.05]The dweller in the darkness, okay.
[235:41.86]I mean, you can clearly see that.
[236:18.62]Oh, you're gonna give me a soap?
[236:21.61]Don't give me a soap!
[236:22.33]Like, right before the- one of the last boss?
[236:25.25]Am I actually gonna get a soap here?
[236:30.91]Holy shit.
[236:34.18]This is a lot of stuff.
[236:37.80]Okay.
[236:39.10]Just remember- okay.
[236:40.36]Let's go.
[236:41.64]What?
[237:00.14]Holy fuck.
[237:02.04]Alright, what's a better hunting rifle?
[237:09.43]No.
[237:11.03]Assault rifle?
[237:12.93]Take out the little guys first.
[237:13.87]That's the plan.
[237:42.62]They're spawning still.
[237:43.50]Ooh, it hit me.
[238:37.13]Found the sword.
[238:38.13]Good.
[238:39.64]Now what?
[238:41.82]Oh, alright.
[238:42.58]Let's keep, we'll keep, let's keep, it keeps rolling, it keeps rolling, it keeps rolling.
[238:52.03]Fuck.
[238:52.87]Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[238:54.49]Give me this.
[239:36.60]Holy, you, thanks for the help, man.
[239:38.06]Come on, don't kill me.
[239:56.35]Oh my god, there's so many of those bullets firing over at me.
[239:59.73]Oh, there's so many of these bullets firing over here.
[240:17.97]Oh no, I didn't save the game!
[240:20.31]Oh shit!
[240:26.85]God!
[240:30.36]That's insane!
[240:31.56]Alright.
[240:34.10]Fuck, that's hard.
[240:38.12]I'm going to do the same thing from before.
[240:39.92]Let's go.
[240:44.19]But different.
[240:44.87]Here we go.
[240:45.27]Watch this.
[240:47.51]No, no, no.
[240:51.05]I haven't got a strategy than this.
[240:55.45]Tall rifle's not good for this.
[240:56.43]I really should just... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[240:59.27]No, kill me.
[240:59.79]Kill me.
[241:00.71]Bad start.
[241:02.25]Kill me.
[241:02.97]Kill me.
[241:08.31]I think I'm just going to use hunting rifle.
[241:09.85]No, no, no, no.
[241:10.61]What am I going to do here?
[241:11.21]What do I want to use?
[241:14.63]Crossbow?
[241:17.91]Maybe the crossbow.
[241:26.40]I need crossbow ammo.
[241:29.20]Is there even crossbow ammo here?
[241:33.68]I wonder if I... Can I actually take a second?
[241:36.77]Probably not.
[241:48.57]No, I'm overthinking it.
[241:50.17]I think I'm just tilted from the last round.
[241:55.66]Yeah, that's absolutely what's happening.
[242:06.08]Bye.
[242:07.71]Alright, alright.
[242:08.77]Start over.
[242:09.29]Start over.
[242:09.85]Regain strength.
[242:15.09]Okay.
[242:19.36]I'm gonna do the same thing as the last time.
[242:21.04]Assault rifle, get rid of the guys on the ground.
[242:23.30]Assault rifle, get rid of the guys on the ground.
[242:32.48]Let me see how... Does this just activate if I walk forward?
[242:35.25]Or can I actually look around for a second?
[242:36.55]No, the music's starting, right?
[242:38.97]Yeah, okay.
[242:39.63]You just have to go.
[242:59.43]That ran into him.
[243:00.18]Holy fuck.
[243:00.76]That was kind of a mistake.
[243:03.70]That's like too much.
[243:07.00]Yeah, it's way too much.
[243:09.44]Too quick.
[243:13.42]Where's my... Just hit six.
[243:18.83]Oh, give me a break.
[243:38.63]God damn it!
[243:41.95]Fuck!
[243:44.94]I got all the time in the world, don't rush it!
[243:46.80]I'm gonna leave one person alive.
[243:59.83]That's the strategy here.
[244:00.63]Okay, let's pick up some shit.
[244:07.09]Did I actually get hit by the one fucking little asshole that's right here?
[244:09.76]Okay, got health.
[244:14.82]Oh, this is over here.
[244:20.36]Rell!
[244:21.66]Okay.
[244:23.58]What's up next?
[244:25.15]I gotta be ready for it.
[244:27.83]Up next is... Alright, that's a good save point.
[244:34.82]I think I'm gonna do... Let's just go.
[244:38.19]I think it's... I don't remember, but we'll just fucking deal with it when it happens.
[244:49.56]Oh, it's a shotgun, guys, right?
[245:08.04]Oh my fucking lord, that's a lot of people!
[245:35.66]Fuck you twice.
[245:42.34]Fuck you a third time.
[245:43.46]I'm not prepared for what's next.
[245:56.35]What is next?
[245:56.91]It's just these idiots.
[246:34.93]What is he, stupid?
[246:35.77]I almost had an ammo.
[246:59.17]Okay, now it's just the mad scientists that are running at me.
[247:04.05]I can handle this.
[247:04.73]I need ammo for a gun!
[247:07.29]Is that it?
[247:27.56]What's that?
[247:30.50]The invisible, the invisible, invisible, invisible, invisible, invisible.
[247:44.08]Fuck you!
[247:45.37]Fuck you!
[248:15.73]Everybody sick?
[248:16.90]Everybody getting sick?
[248:26.67]I was getting sick I had to stop.
[248:28.49]Oh my fuck.
[248:54.72]Oh, that's a bad idea right now
[249:27.45]Whoa, you're spawning on me, bro.
[249:36.31]You're spawning on me.
[249:42.46]Oh!
[249:47.56]It's too many.
[249:48.40]It's too much.
[249:49.60]It's too much.
[249:56.95]It's too much, man!
[249:58.01]It's too much!
[250:03.99]Ah, I can't even slow- you can't even slow down either!
[250:05.97]You can't even slow down, I'm dead!
[250:09.66]Oh!
[250:12.26]My god!
[250:22.62]Oh man, oh man.
[250:27.02]Okay, I have to start saving it again.
[250:29.02]Okay, slow down.
[250:30.04]Fuck me.
[250:33.62]Oh yeah, right this part with the fucking animals.
[250:37.32]Where are they?
[250:55.54]Dude, jumping like this is gonna give me a fucking brain aneurysm.
[251:00.12]It's gonna run.
[251:23.23]Not these guys.
[251:26.77]Anything with these guys.
[251:27.80]I'll do anything with these guys.
[251:30.48]Anything with these guys.
[251:35.54]Fuck.
[251:43.16]I have to do this for a second.
[251:45.90]You can't do that for that long without having your hands come off the keyboard.
[251:49.98]Ugh.
[252:13.66]I'm gonna just snipe.
[252:14.46]It's much easier.
[252:15.08]There we go.
[252:37.84]Now we have to do this stuff.
[252:39.28]It's crossbow time.
[252:41.27]Don't get overwhelmed.
[252:42.01]Just get them all before they spawn.
[252:42.95]Get them all before they spawn.
[253:46.38]I gotta use the shotgun for a little bit.
[253:48.95]Oh, no!
[253:55.13]How are you still alive, man?
[253:57.09]What a flying goddamn diaper...
[254:09.00]I've expelled, like, all my energy.
[254:10.88]I don't have any energy left.
[254:13.34]I just quicksaved and got hit in the air by this fucking dog.
[254:16.14]I hope that's it.
[254:17.34]That's not it.
[254:22.09]Save it right here.
[254:22.71]Oh my god, please!
[254:25.87]Save it right here!
[254:30.37]What is it?
[254:31.57]What is it?
[254:34.80]I don't understand.
[254:36.67]Is it the dog?
[254:40.07]It's rats!
[254:49.61]They're just on the ground.
[255:08.22]I'm not gonna kill the last one.
[255:09.28]This is my break.
[255:13.42]Okay, this is my break.
[255:18.87]Any other items that I can pick up?
[255:20.43]I can get health.
[255:29.28]Rats, rats, rats, rats.
[255:36.60]I want to get into this next little... Where is he?
[255:39.31]I can hear him.
[255:40.05]He's gonna probably kill me.
[255:41.41]Imagine if he killed me.
[255:42.35]I would cry on screen.
[255:45.57]I would turn the webcam on and just cry for you guys.
[255:47.93]Okay... And... 84 health.
[256:00.36]There he is.
[256:00.92]All these bullets.
[256:06.48]86 health.
[256:07.86]Okay, I'm ready.
[256:08.62]Let's go.
[256:09.57]Whatever it is.
[256:10.05]See ya.
[256:25.97]Go left, left, left.
[256:41.39]I have to go to the bathroom, like... I'm gonna pee.
[256:49.23]Yeah, I gotta pee.
[256:52.33]Even if I do it, I have to pee.
[256:57.77]I should be okay, though.
[257:00.09]Although, I only have 11 health.
[257:13.38]Oh, I have to pee.
[257:14.76]And I need a break, man.
[257:16.37]I'll be right back.
[257:17.31]I gotta pee.
[258:28.68]Hmm.
[258:28.80]Hmm.
[259:13.76]Dude, the temperature in this room is... It's probably like 95 degrees.
[259:40.29]I'm just, I'm heating up this room.
[259:43.93]Ugh, this is fucking intense, man.
[259:48.11]Alright, let's go.
[259:50.61]I shook around a little bit, I stretched.
[259:52.17]Whoa.
[259:52.55]Alright, where are we at?
[259:55.80]Oh yeah, it's just a rat.
[259:56.90]Just a rat.
[259:58.42]Okay, so the next thing that comes up is... The chainsaw guys, which are one shot with this gun.
[260:07.76]Alright, let me see if that helps.
[260:13.09]He's not dead?
[260:14.13]He just got hit by a double-barreled shotgun.
[260:16.56]Oops.
[260:42.73]No, you can't.
[260:43.71]If you stop moving, you are dead.
[260:45.83]You're just dead.
[260:49.34]Like, you gotta just keep the... Or you're just dead.
[261:05.59]Guaranteed dead.
[261:09.93]What's that?
[261:10.21]What's that?
[261:14.30]What's going on?
[261:15.06]What is that?
[261:15.54]What's that?
[261:16.44]What?
[261:16.82]What happened?
[261:17.78]I thought that was a new enemy.
[261:20.66]Oh, it's swordsmen and ladies?
[261:33.54]Oh man, this is not good.
[261:34.96]And it's the ladies.
[261:36.94]I just stay on the outside?
[261:38.72]Oh fuck man.
[261:40.36]Okay, I gotta relax.
[261:41.94]I don't even know how the hell do you relax like this.
[261:51.77]They're just like kind of killing each other.
[262:09.32]Y'all think I'm gonna be crazy.
[262:10.44]You think I'm crazy, but I'm just gonna get... No, not yet.
[262:19.48]Okay.
[262:20.52]Look at all this health everywhere.
[262:28.70]Ah!
[262:29.54]Just pick it all up, quick!
[262:32.08]Watchers up the gate?
[262:33.61]Oh!
[262:51.75]Oh shit!
[262:52.55]This helmet in the middle!
[262:53.65]I gotta go in the middle!
[262:55.01]I gotta go in the middle!
[262:59.29]I gotta get this helmet in the middle!
[263:02.84]No, I can't do that.
[263:03.72]That's not gonna happen.
[263:54.65]He's still bouncing around yeah
[263:59.05]Alright, what about this, like, this guy?
[264:01.01]This, like, Jason?
[264:03.58]Nope.
[264:04.02]Down.
[264:05.22]Alright, I'm gonna take out... I don't even know what I'm gonna do here to get this health if I can.
[264:10.34]I'm gonna take out one of the horses.
[264:12.14]Yeah, dude, the horse has gotta go first.
[264:16.59]Like, they just gotta.
[264:18.25]Eh, great.
[264:18.65]I'm glad I walked in.
[264:19.41]Just kill me.
[264:20.75]Don't.
[264:21.01]No, no, no.
[264:21.31]Don't over yet.
[264:28.40]Really?
[264:30.60]Oh, goodness gracious.
[264:32.54]This is un... This is ridiculous.
[264:35.57]This dialed up by a thousand.
[264:40.86]What happened to my ammo?
[264:56.48]Imagine if you still have the soap.
[264:59.40]Don't remind me of my failure.
[265:05.16]That wasn't bad.
[265:24.14]Trying to get the dogs.
[265:50.59]Please!
[265:58.24]That was insane.
[265:59.18]That was ridiculous.
[266:01.40]That was fucking crazy.
[266:06.54]That was fun.
[266:07.88]But that was nuts.
[266:16.42]Can you imagine playing that if you get hit once you die?
[266:20.67]You die in one hit.
[266:22.63]Oh, I would... I don't know if I'd be able to do that one.
[266:28.02]Just making sure I get everything.
[266:33.80]Every little tiny little crumb of every crust of health.
[266:39.12]I'm picking it up.
[266:46.37]Okay.
[266:48.59]There it is.
[266:53.89]So now what?
[266:58.60]Just through the door?
[267:00.70]Okay.
[267:06.58]Damn.
[267:18.32]What was the one secret?
[267:21.16]What did I miss?
[267:27.11]It was the thing at the start.
[267:30.94]What, I could have actually done that?
[267:37.04]Dusk.
[267:50.46]Okay, I've got ammo.
[267:55.13]Into the house over here?
[267:58.76]Ooh, a crystal.
[268:00.54]Left Crystal of Madness.
[268:01.88]I'm not doing that.
[268:16.09]I'm not going to lift up the Crystal of Madness just yet.
[268:23.44]Got all the stuff that's in there.
[268:25.04]Just want to make sure I have everything.
[268:28.02]Is this the actual final final battle?
[268:49.21]What's up here?
[269:11.00]I would make a comment on it, but why would I?
[269:13.22]And, guys, there's a soap here.
[269:16.47]Could I use the soap and whip it into the last box?
[269:26.27]Okay, let's keep the soap over there for an emergency scenario.
[269:42.30]Alright, now let's go pick up that crystal over here.
[269:49.18]Alright.
[269:51.58]It's been a fun game.
[269:54.53]It's time to see how it ends.
[270:18.16]Are you gonna come out of there or do I have to go in?
[270:19.76]Where's my soap?
[270:50.89]That started quickly.
[271:29.23]Jacob!
[271:45.72]At last.
[271:46.76]I gotta be moving already.
[271:49.24]You've finally arrived.
[271:52.25]You shall be my final test.
[272:09.52]I'm going too fast.
[272:14.92]Okay, that was a mistake.
[272:54.10]Kill him!
[272:54.66]Unworthy.
[272:55.65]Unworthy.
[273:23.68]Just in case I softlock myself.
[273:27.65]Whatever.
[273:41.72]Hey.
[273:43.71]He was worthy.
[273:47.08]And he accomplished so much.
[273:50.30]Dude, you should stop streaming.
[273:52.28]This game's not for you.
[273:54.90]You, who were stronger.
[273:57.84]You, who were faster.
[274:01.16]You, I like better.
[274:08.18]Who did you expect at the end of all of this?
[274:13.40]I didn't... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[274:32.32]Who is this?
[274:34.60]Okay, I need to... I found a secret.
[274:45.37]How do you kill this guy?
[274:50.21]Under?
[274:50.63]Over?
[274:50.91]In his glue?
[274:53.53]In his body?
[274:54.19]In his face?
[274:57.25]Explosives?
[274:58.87]The light.
[275:00.15]The light.
[275:06.88]What?
[275:08.38]What's going on?
[275:08.88]I need to get him in the light.
[275:19.06]Okay, I need to save it right when he's about to be done talking.
[275:29.39]He was worthy, you know.
[275:32.73]And he accomplished so much.
[275:36.97]But then, you came along.
[275:40.63]You, who were stronger.
[275:43.51]You, who were faster.
[275:48.64]I can't save it.
[275:49.26]I have to save it while I'm falling.
[275:51.54]It's just me.
[275:51.88]And here we go.
[276:31.33]What?
[276:31.55]That's what you do.
[276:32.09]Got it.
[276:32.53]Okay.
[276:32.93]What?
[276:39.27]Wait, I... I... This is... All this stuff, all the particle effects, it hurt my head.
[276:44.62]I'm like looking... Alright, so there's another crack.
[276:47.74]Alright, I don't have to do that anymore.
[276:55.55]Ah, okay.
[276:58.15]Okay, he swings.
[276:59.67]Then he goes.
[277:00.29]You have to jump over his arm.
[277:01.75]Got it.
[277:03.14]Again.
[277:03.36]Alright, I figured it out.
[277:06.62]Oh, man.
[277:07.46]I'm going to do that a thousand times.
[277:08.82]It's going to end up killing me.
[277:11.84]It's all the green, man.
[277:12.86]It's messing with my brain.
[277:14.02]I have to restart.
[277:18.73]Just die.
[277:20.71]All the green is causing me problems.
[277:34.91]Where is it?
[277:37.39]There's a light.
[277:57.56]Where's it going?
[277:58.44]Fuck.
[278:01.18]Move your hand!
[278:03.51]Move your hand!
[278:04.67]Fucking god, man.
[278:35.67]Where's the other one?
[278:36.78]How do I, can I shoot it with my regular?
[278:49.62]Die!
[279:07.05]You are indeed worthy.
[279:11.32]And so now, my power is yours.
[279:16.84]I don't want it!
[279:17.40]I want to spread it equally to everybody on Earth!
[279:20.84]How did I get pacifist?
[279:26.23]What was the secret?
[279:37.76]Completionist and pacifist?
[279:41.18]How does it feel?
[279:44.84]Horrible, isn't it?
[279:48.09]But wonderful, yes?
[279:55.63]I like that last touch, man.
[279:56.65]Who you were before is insignificant.
[280:01.42]Who you are now is inconceivable.
[280:07.78]But here you shall remain till I have need of you again.
[280:12.75]For one must always reign beneath dusk.
[280:14.83]Of the Witch King?
[280:31.24]My brothers have escaped you.
[280:41.10]My brothers will not die in vain, vain, vain.
[280:47.12]That was really, really fun.
[280:57.42]So... What did I...
[281:03.83]Dude, just throw in the towel!
[281:06.28]This is not, this game is not for you!
[281:21.36]That's like one of my favorite comments of the whole stream.
[281:30.59]Like that was, it was funny.
[281:37.15]Uh, so that was Dusk.
[281:39.69]But, I'm not done with Dusk.
[281:43.48]There's another game mode that I want to try where you have to fight waves.
[281:47.44]I'd like to try it.
[281:50.42]Play the rat level.
[281:53.92]Does this find the secret?
[281:54.72]Alright, we'll find the secret rat level.
[281:56.01]That's fine.
[282:04.77]Finally, yes.
[282:06.21]Check out AMID EVIL.
[282:07.32]I'm going to do that next.
[282:08.18]I was looking at that actually last night.
[282:17.44]We're not going to play that now, though.
[282:21.23]We're probably going to do that... Is that one of them?
[282:34.93]well you look dead alright let's do endless alright so here let me give you a rundown that was uh that was very very good very good 9.3
[283:08.00]I was 9.4, but there was that one part with the vents.
[283:11.13]Remember, I was going up and down, and I had to drop it by a point.
[283:14.95]By a tenth of a point.
[283:15.57]9 points for you.
[283:22.41]That's very high.
[283:23.19]It is.
[283:29.74]Something about the shooting mechanics in this game felt just way more fun than other FPS games.
[283:36.31]Now, I actually like this game a lot because a lot of the old school shooters, they were like the cardboard cutout sprite type stuff with the 2D plane sprites.
[283:52.32]I actually am not a big fan of that.
[284:00.41]I don't hate it or anything, but I like how this game doesn't do that.
[284:05.81]It's 3D.
[284:05.99]There's no sprites, like the 2D sprites.
[284:11.37]What are you, a Gen Xer?
[284:12.79]No.
[284:15.14]The rat level is hidden in episode 3, map 4.
[284:17.44]That's a good no.
[284:19.30]Alright, level select.
[284:21.48]Episode 3, map 4.
[284:27.61]How do I pick the level?
[284:35.06]Can I not pick a level?
[284:48.89]Right, okay.
[284:50.13]Episode 3, map 4.
[284:51.83]So this is 1, 2, 3, 4.
[284:56.95]Not with this current loadout.
[284:58.05]I want... Just give me everything.
[285:09.34]So where is it?
[285:10.70]Is it hard to find?
[285:20.72]It's right there.
[285:25.69]Where are my guns?
[285:40.80]I didn't select them?
[285:43.02]How the hell did I do that?
[285:50.41]Alright, hold on.
[285:51.09]I need my guns.
[286:00.43]Oh, you actually have to activate them.
[286:03.04]I see.
[286:21.19]Okay.
[286:23.71]So where's it at?
[286:25.43]Just play until I can find it, kind of?
[286:37.14]It's over there.
[286:37.80]It's over there.
[286:40.90]Why am I still crouching?
[286:44.52]There's the key.
[286:46.52]Yellow key.
[286:48.78]Find the toilet.
[287:00.70]Red.
[287:03.50]I'm trying to go fast here, but it's probably a bad idea.
[287:05.82]Can't see.
[287:14.34]Placement door.
[287:19.32]Placement door is down here.
[287:20.60]I got all the guns in the game.
[287:25.81]Why am I...
[287:40.74]And now we go down.
[287:42.68]Wait, get the Cheshire Trust.
[287:44.75]Just for fun.
[287:48.19]Alright, down here.
[287:49.95]Pick up this thing.
[287:51.31]Sure thing.
[287:52.11]Go around this way.
[287:53.45]Right?
[287:53.79]And we go this way.
[287:54.63]And then we... And then we... Alright, through here.
[288:01.33]Hopefully...
[288:06.62]Here we are.
[288:07.40]I made it.
[288:08.14]There's two guys down this hallway.
[288:09.67]I remember them coming down here.
[288:11.27]I remember you.
[288:11.93]There's another one.
[288:19.54]Actually, no, it's a Wendigo.
[288:22.78]Right?
[288:23.34]From what I remember.
[288:39.73]Oh, come on.
[288:49.84]Going too fast, but I have to.
[288:51.24]Ah, please.
[288:59.37]He's dying to frog wheel.
[289:06.51]Yeah, whatever.
[289:07.63]Okay, uh, I remember this part.
[289:10.23]Sort of.
[289:11.23]Kind of.
[289:11.55]Alright, alright.
[289:15.23]You know, I'm looking for a toilet, you said.
[289:24.92]Wendigo's in this one.
[289:37.02]Okay.
[289:39.70]Was I not supposed to kill that?
[289:40.67]Okay.
[289:45.93]Where's my flashlight?
[289:49.13]I still haven't gotten my flashlight.
[289:52.73]I think I should have by now, right?
[289:53.91]Because I just ran through a ton of shit.
[290:09.84]Okay.
[290:13.26]There we go.
[290:18.69]Forget about this guy.
[290:19.67]There's nothing in here, right?
[290:23.59]Okay, now the next part.
[290:28.02]Um, I don't remember.
[290:29.00]Because this is the blue door.
[290:34.88]Was there another way to go?
[290:39.73]No, yeah, this way.
[290:40.53]There's a flashlight, there's a blue key.
[290:45.66]Okay, let's move.
[291:15.19]Okay.
[291:25.03]I think I'm close, right?
[291:27.47]It's before the toy- Don't copypasta that, that was bad info.
[291:34.72]Don't copypasta!
[291:35.98]Don't!
[291:36.24]Bad info!
[291:43.69]Uh, let's get my crossbow ready.
[291:47.56]Activate this.
[291:50.20]Alright, I think I'm ready to go.
[291:52.04]You!
[291:52.26]And you!
[292:17.43]How are you doing?
[292:18.03]Good?
[292:19.21]Good.
[292:29.26]Forget about this part.
[292:31.56]Dog.
[292:35.65]Don't think he can't make it out.
[292:36.75]He can.
[293:16.86]Okay, um... Somebody else.
[293:20.66]Where are you?
[293:28.04]Silence.
[293:32.60]Alright, red key.
[293:34.80]I've got the red key.
[293:36.34]I need to go back.
[293:37.44]So... Do I activate this?
[293:42.62]When you go through the yellow door, turn left and look behind the junk for a secret switch.
[293:49.75]Owlclove is open.
[293:52.71]Which brings us back to here.
[293:54.01]Alright.
[293:59.99]This thing's pretty... rad.
[294:02.56]I don't use that term very often.
[294:10.98]Wait, hold on.
[294:13.14]So... I'm done in here.
[294:15.92]To get back there... Go back all the way down.
[294:21.55]to where I was before with that red door.
[294:34.06]How far back was it?
[294:42.73]It was all the way up here, wasn't it?
[294:46.55]Chaos crawls to me.
[294:48.97]Right.
[294:50.50]Okay.
[294:55.41]Does it now?
[295:01.45]Look, is it back down here?
[295:08.23]Um, is it?
[295:18.92]I can't get back up here through here.
[295:20.16]Hmm.
[295:28.46]He found the strawberry room.
[295:31.63]Did I miss it back up here?
[295:46.30]Alright, now it's just the red door back here.
[295:48.84]Alright, there's the yellow door.
[295:59.34]Where's the red door?
[296:14.31]Back up.
[296:21.33]Damn, that's far.
[296:22.31]That's all the way back here.
[296:23.45]Alright.
[296:24.59]Wait, didn't I already do this?
[296:27.83]I already did this.
[296:36.38]No, this is wrong.
[296:37.22]So, wait.
[296:52.06]Then multiple red doors.
[296:53.66]Oh, shit.
[296:57.81]Um... Left after yellow door.
[297:06.22]Isn't that the one that I just opened?
[297:09.43]So, left after yellow door.
[297:13.15]Is... You're talking about, like, go here.
[297:16.01]Like, through here.
[297:16.53]Should I just open a wiki?
[297:20.79]Behind the junk?
[297:24.24]Okay.
[297:29.24]Okay.
[297:37.69]Now... Now where?
[297:46.24]He's actually blind.
[297:47.50]What are you talking about?
[297:53.00]Okay, but... So... Dude, this changed.
[297:57.30]This was... I knew... I had my... In my brain, this was a different... I'm not taking this soap.
[298:05.59]Like this was... I pressed a button and all of a sudden the whole world changes?
[298:09.67]I didn't think this was anything important.
[298:24.04]Flush your sins away.
[298:58.68]I thought that was a secret- This is the se- I- This is not bullshit, this is a real place?
[299:09.77]I thought- Wow, okay.
[299:11.61]I stand completely corrected here.
[299:13.01]This is a whole new level.
[299:14.37]Alright.
[299:17.68]I thought you guys were just taking the piss.
[299:20.14]I thought that was like a secret way to leave that level.
[299:21.82]Alright, well, whatever, let's go.
[299:40.44]Alright.
[299:49.73]Shit.
[299:50.15]Alright, it's time just to smoke him out.
[300:12.50]Alright, yellow key.
[300:15.87]That was a direct hit.
[300:18.39]Leave all this stuff.
[300:20.25]Red key.
[300:24.91]It's the cat police.
[300:26.15]Alright, a couple ways to go.
[300:30.15]Let's try this way first.
[300:45.90]Hey!
[300:48.00]You little bastard!
[301:00.78]Oh, fuck.
[301:03.86]They're gonna bite your toes off.
[301:11.74]I hope not.
[301:12.18]Alright, red.
[301:21.26]Secret inside of the secret.
[301:26.37]Interesting.
[301:29.55]Alright, I got a red key.
[301:40.38]This is another secret?
[301:52.98]Hey.
[301:55.21]Ooh, it is.
[301:57.11]And shotguns.
[301:59.25]Put on the rat song.
[302:15.01]Alright.
[302:16.25]Turn on the rat song for one hour.
[302:19.46]Rat.
[302:25.17]This is gonna start fucking with me.
[302:49.20]Wait.
[302:53.48]I can't take this.
[302:55.20]I can only take this for like 30 seconds.
[303:03.13]Egomaniac.
[303:07.71]Nah, I can't do this for more than a few minutes.
[303:23.22]But I'm killing them, that's not something you- Put on the birthday remix?
[303:28.42]What happened to the song?
[303:31.34]Oh.
[303:31.56]It's infiltrating my brain.
[303:54.93]Yellow key!
[303:56.77]Oh man, it's like a maze!
[303:59.99]Alright, I need the yellow key.
[304:03.73]Yellow.
[304:04.63]Alright, birthday remix.
[304:06.25]I can't hear this anymore.
[304:24.00]Um, that's an- I just clicked on the wrong one.
[304:26.18]It's staying.
[304:33.78]It's staying.
[304:34.76]This song is so fucking stupid.
[304:53.20]I need a blue key.
[304:56.06]No, fuck this song.
[304:57.02]I don't want to listen to this one either.
[304:58.10]How about, uh... Rat's Birthday Mixtape.
[305:13.93]Why did this have 679,000 views?
[305:20.22]I didn't even upload this.
[305:22.44]This is just a video.
[305:27.21]That's a lot of views.
[305:28.73]Alright, I need to get a yellow key.
[305:42.03]I'm lost.
[305:57.89]I know that's where the blue door is, but where do I get the blue key?
[306:03.39]I am so lost.
[306:05.51]Um... There it is.
[306:07.59]Turn it up.
[307:45.71]It's not... It's not done?
[307:54.27]That was actually a giant rat.
[307:57.47]Flush yourself back down.
[307:58.55]Did I just... Didn't I try that?
[307:59.89]I was standing on it.
[308:01.03]Oh.
[308:06.00]Hooray!
[308:10.32]That was cool.
[308:13.97]What does this put you out?
[308:15.53]You skip to the next level?
[308:18.43]This puts you on Blasphemy.
[308:19.80]That was fun.
[308:22.34]Alright, let me actually... I'm glad you guys told me to do that.
[308:26.48]Alright, Endless Mode, The Farm, Cerro Miedo.
[308:30.06]I wanna try it.
[308:37.42]See, this is a series of waves.
[308:50.35]Damage numbers or something?
[308:53.47]Have there been damage numbers this whole game?
[309:03.31]Uh oh, I probably should have done that.
[309:07.86]Alright, wave two.
[309:16.18]Where are you?
[309:16.58]Oh, you're behind me.
[309:23.40]Ooh, wait.
[309:25.60]Shotgun.
[309:26.00]Yeah, give me the shotgun.
[309:30.32]Alright, is there any health?
[309:31.60]Or do I just have to survive?
[309:40.59]Oh my god, he's up there.
[309:44.95]He just spawned on top of me.
[309:52.03]Why does he get to wave 3?
[309:53.64]I can do better than that.
[309:54.34]Is this shooting faster or am I insane?
[310:11.52]Taking damage on wave 1?
[310:13.28]Laugh out loud!
[310:29.23]I just want to make sure I get everything, all the levels, you know?
[310:35.34]So what's a respectable thing to get to?
[310:41.87]What's a respectable way?
[310:43.77]Three?
[311:04.00]20?
[311:04.02]20?!
[311:04.04]Are you kidding me?
[311:21.58]Re-chat.
[311:22.64]Re-chat.
[311:23.54]Once you hit 20, you're in the big leagues.
[311:39.72]alright using rifle on that kind of enemies seriously this guy should go home go home go home turn off your streaming go home

[313:11.39]God!
[313:13.37]Did he wrap around behind me?
[313:14.81]He just gave me one hit.
[313:15.73]Stupid.
[313:33.67]Give me all my shit.
[313:34.77]Give me all my shit.
[313:35.41]Give me all my shit.

[316:18.38]No way.
[316:19.22]No way.
[316:19.94]No way.
[316:23.60]There's no way.
[316:25.36]No way.
[316:31.20]Dude, you left your stream on.
[316:32.93]I'm playing.
[316:35.59]This game's dangerous.
[316:39.09]This is not a drill.
[316:40.01]Dremel95 is playing the Raticums.
[316:43.51]And it has the song on in the background.
[316:45.85]Hahaha.
[316:50.85]This game's dangerous, because... I... I just... I know I have what it takes to get to, like, 10 or 20.
[317:01.10]But... I've been playing... I played it a lot today.
[317:06.12]I might be blending together.
[317:08.60]I know I can do it.
[317:09.90]And that's... That's what... That's the problem.
[317:13.42]Is me thinking I can get to, like, level 10 will keep me here for five hours straight.
[317:30.31]I'm gonna slow down.
[317:31.95]What's with the speed?
[317:35.91]You don't have to go that fast.
[317:37.87]You really don't.
[317:38.47]In fact, it's probably better off if you don't.
[317:42.81]Okay, let's just keep it going.
[318:05.52]okay that's good I have to at least get to like seven or eight I have to I'm just not gonna get to level seven how would I ever call my mother later and say I you know and talk to her on our weekly Sunday discussion

[319:05.62]I want to spam.
[319:06.82]I can't look away.
[319:07.34]You gotta spam it.

[320:15.81]Is there another chainsaw guy?
[320:17.49]There is, isn't there?
[320:18.57]I know there's a chainsaw guy hanging out.
[320:20.71]He forgot he was streaming again.

[321:26.76]I don't know how he missed.
[321:27.79]Alright, I got to seven.

[321:29.23]I'm done.
[321:30.19]Game's fun.
[321:32.13]Okay, that's instantly dead.
[321:39.68]Alright, I'm happy with it.
[321:48.66]I got to seven.
[321:49.34]That's all I care about.
[321:51.32]Fuck.
[321:53.04]That's a lot of guys with the shotguns.
[321:57.64]Can't reach 10.
[322:00.76]I'm okay with that.
[322:01.70]It's tough.
[322:04.37]It's tricky.
[322:04.97]It is, guys.
[322:05.91]It's tricky.
[322:10.89]Play a different map, you donut.
[322:12.53]I'm a man.
[322:40.02]I call that bullshit.
[322:58.51]He thinks he's screaming again.
[322:59.87]Alright, if I don't get the seven, who cares.
[323:05.33]But I'm gonna do a different map after this.
[323:16.11]Oh my lord, I didn't even know he existed.
[323:18.17]Didn't even know.
[323:28.72]These guys are so fast.
[323:30.50]Like, they're SO fast.
[323:34.28]My eyes are itching.
[323:34.98]What do I do?
[324:13.05]Call the eye doctor!
[324:19.02]Did I actually get hit by that?
[324:25.56]Somebody's still running around.
[324:26.94]It's this guy.
[324:27.50]Is the dog still there?
[324:36.81]I hope not.
[324:37.31]Where's the dog?
[324:46.54]Alright.
[324:46.81]Wave 6.
[325:16.31]Die!
[325:16.83]Oh, will he die?
[325:19.73]Okay, I'm... Seven.
[325:39.37]The problem was I had the shotgun equipped and it's just not fast enough when you have like ten people running into the room.
[326:00.96]Oh, that's gonna fuck with me.
[326:05.02]Hey, is he still alive?
[326:21.55]Gimme all the guns!
[326:25.83]I know there's somebody behind me, I know there is, I know.
[326:46.27]Okay.
[326:47.49]Let's put that spawn.
[326:49.17]I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[327:10.39]Did he just juke me?
[327:16.78]This is hard.
[327:18.30]This is tricky.
[327:19.16]This is where... Especially the spawns.
[327:28.13]You just don't know where to go.
[327:29.15]You just gotta keep moving.
[327:30.51]What if you move?
[327:31.17]What if there's a guy?
[327:31.77]What if a crazy doctor spawns on top of you?
[327:34.08]Just stabs you.
[327:50.29]Give me all this stuff.
[327:52.07]I have no health.
[327:52.97]This is a wash.
[327:59.57]Is there anything down there?
[328:21.33]Two shots for the crazy doctors.
[328:25.14]Didn't want to pick that up.
[328:28.46]God damn it.
[328:41.53]Hey!
[328:58.74]Oh, my health is so low!
[329:01.20]Where are those onions?
[329:02.63]Where are those onions?
[329:05.45]Where are the onions?
[329:16.17]What?
[329:19.62]What just happened?
[329:23.64]What even hit me?
[329:27.30]Alright, we'll do the Cathedral.
[329:28.68]I'm burning up.
[329:31.64]I'm burning out here.
[329:32.46]I probably should have picked that up after.
[330:02.61]You don't want to be stuck out.
[330:03.69]I gotta get items.
[330:06.09]Whoa!
[330:07.93]That's... This is gonna be scary.
[330:13.79]Guns.
[330:18.72]Need them.
[330:37.53]Don't use these yet.
[330:41.85]The back of my head is itching.
[330:50.40]Why is my head so itchy?
[330:51.56]What's wrong with my body?
[330:56.42]I'll take the sword.
[330:57.24]That's actually pretty good.
[331:22.64]Dog's got him.
[331:42.45]Who's left?
[332:00.04]The tornado is here.
[332:01.75]The tornado is here.
[332:02.85]I did it.
[332:27.01]Is there another tornado?
[332:28.07]Another tornado.
[332:43.89]God damn it.
[332:46.39]God damn it.
[332:51.99]I'm out of cool shit.
[332:53.14]I'm out of good shit.
[333:03.66]Oh my god, that just threw me off so bad.
[333:08.38]Where did you even come from?
[333:10.78]What?
[333:11.10]Alright, this is my last attempt.
[333:23.99]This one's too long.
[333:35.07]one mistake, and it's over.
[333:39.94]You make a single mistake.
[333:42.04]No.
[333:42.44]No human error allowed.
[333:43.68]Don't you dare.
[333:44.16]I got dead.
[333:49.88]God.
[333:55.35]I'm dead.
[333:56.55]I'm dead.
[333:56.95]I'm dead.
[333:57.49]Alright.
[334:00.93]Last attempt.
[334:01.51]That's it.
[334:01.95]And I'm done.
[334:21.60]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[334:22.88]Give me some weapons.
[334:27.64]Give me some shit.
[334:28.24]I gotta get items.
[334:46.78]Okay, now I'm gonna do two rounds inside the cathedral.
[334:51.24]With the Riveter.
[334:52.14]This should be good enough.
[334:56.10]Okay.
[335:19.55]We're good.
[335:20.19]Stay in here.
[335:24.08]That's why the tornado comes.
[335:25.64]So you can't pull this shit.
[335:31.18]There's a lot of health out there.
[335:47.19]Alright, it's time to move out.
[336:00.12]Here comes the tornado.
[336:17.54]Oh man, that happened to quickly.
[336:23.32]How did I miss?
[336:23.86]I don't know.
[336:32.23]Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[336:35.31]I'm dead.
[336:36.43]See you later.
[336:37.43]I wasn't getting out.
[336:38.93]Yeah, I'm not getting away from that one.
[336:45.04]I couldn't go left because there was the... Oh, it's fucked.
[336:51.26]Damn.
[336:54.32]I threw it.
[336:54.90]Well, I mean, I just... I couldn't get around it fast enough.
[337:32.63]Okay.
[337:33.41]This is actually it.
[337:37.90]No matter what.
[337:38.36]I have to get the other weapons.
[337:42.50]I don't like thinking.
[337:44.26]Alright, get some weapons.
[337:56.92]Why would you just do that?
[337:58.32]Why would you tell me?
[338:04.13]What grenades do I... Now I'm in trouble.
[338:32.69]Machine gun, fire!
[338:56.69]You gotta be standing right there, dick.
[339:07.39]Dude, he's going wacky.
[339:09.99]Alright, I... I gotta try to get to Pass 7.
[339:15.94]Although... I'm running on empty.
[339:18.56]It's alright.
[339:19.62]No excuses.
[339:20.14]Let's go.
[339:27.38]That was bad.
[339:28.06]That was very, very bad.
[339:29.09]That was the worst thing that could have possibly happened.
[339:31.71]I thought he was already on the other side.
[339:33.05]I'm dead.
[339:35.37]Oh yeah, this is over.
[339:36.59]Where'd the dog go?
[340:00.38]Oh, man.
[340:02.00]It's so intense.
[340:03.78]I'm so addicted to it, but it's so intense.
[340:20.05]Again?
[340:20.45]No, no.
[340:21.15]I think I'm at a wall right now.
[340:24.93]Maybe if I started with this.
[340:26.95]Look, I blew every ounce of my video gamer essence on that gauntlet level where I had to fight like 5,000 people.
[340:38.24]My gaming spirit is depleted.
[340:50.14]His gaming meter is low.
[340:56.36]Boost his morale So here's the deal I'm gonna do it one more time I'm gonna be quiet this time
[343:03.17]I still got it That is holy shit calm down
[343:55.93]Fucking assholes.
[343:57.13]God, this spread and the damages.
[343:59.38]God, this sucks.
[344:20.65]Whoa.
[344:30.99]Oh, okay.
[344:31.35]I need health.
[344:34.87]That's not good enough.
[344:43.70]How am I ever gonna kill these guys when there's ten of them that spawn on top of the roofs?
[344:48.56]I just gotta wait for the spawns, I think.
[344:57.79]Yeah.
[344:59.30]Yeah, okay, give me the, uh... It was a rifle ammo.
[345:11.84]No, I didn't want you to die!
[345:12.83]I didn't want you to die.
[345:13.53]Oh, it's so hard!
[345:27.53]God damn it.
[345:33.42]Ah, it's so hard.
[345:38.22]They're all up on their rafters.
[345:39.86]You gotta, like, almost hide.
[345:41.46]You can't hide in here, though.
[345:50.75]No, that's it.
[345:51.65]That's it.
[345:52.33]I'm just... Okay, I'm gonna say my goodbyes to you while I do this, and I'm not paying attention, so maybe I'll do better.
[346:00.39]So, next week...
[346:02.46]I'm going to be gone for a couple days.
[346:05.82]I'll see you guys on... What's today?
[346:09.40]What is today?
[346:10.26]What's today?
[346:13.68]Saturday?
[346:14.43]Sunday?
[346:19.95]Saturday.
[346:21.89]I'll see you guys on Tuesday and what we're going to do is we're going to start the Outer Worlds.
[346:26.25]I'm going to just play it.
[346:26.99]I've been putting it off and putting it off and putting it off for a month.
[346:44.91]So that's what we're gonna do.
[346:52.02]I have no idea anything about the game, I just know that it's the New Vegas guys.
[346:59.19]And it's their new video game.
[347:25.91]Where's the guy with the gun here?
[347:26.80]He's right there.
[347:28.52]Here he is.
[348:20.70]Alright, slow down.
[348:24.16]Give me this shit.
[348:26.13]Pick it all up.
[348:33.63]And look, here's the thing.
[348:34.79]If Outer Worlds... If I don't like Outer Worlds... Then I just won't play it.
[348:56.82]You either like it or you don't.
[349:21.22]Okay, I have an opportunity here.
[349:28.04]Okay, the strategy is shotgun.
[350:20.30]There's somebody else.
[350:20.98]Alright, I did it.
[350:28.43]I actually, I finally did it.
[350:29.37]I can go to bed now.
[350:31.51]I can go to bed.
[350:32.41]I'm done.
[350:33.25]I'm done.
[350:33.57]I did my thing.
[350:34.72]I'm going to cash out here.
[350:36.58]Alright, this is who wants to be a millionaire.
[350:37.94]I got to the $40,000 question.
[350:40.42]I just got it and I'm done.
[350:41.58]I'll take the money, please.
[351:20.85]Alright, I'm... I'm gonna pick a PS.
[351:30.81]Not yet, though.
[351:31.23]I need ammo.
[351:33.71]Okay, good.
[351:37.65]Want me to use ammo?
[351:39.45]Five community subs.
[351:40.15]Thanks for the five community subs.
[351:44.03]Nearshu, thank you for that.
[352:06.77]What level is it?
[352:12.83]Alright, that's it.
[352:26.02]I had to do that.
[352:29.57]Getting to level 20 is where it really begins.
[352:31.72]Holy shit, I can't imagine how hard that is.
[352:35.54]If you get past level 10, 12, 15... Oh, actually, perfect time to stop.
[352:43.52]We're just at about exactly almost six hours.
[352:46.56]Exactly what I thought it was going to be.
[352:53.03]So I will see you guys again on Tuesday.
[352:56.35]We're going to do the Outer Worlds.
[353:01.41]Get to level 10.
[353:02.51]Oh, I can't.
[353:03.85]I'm burnt up.
[353:07.22]I have to ash my body that is a cigarette right now.
[353:10.42]Like, there's just... You haven't ashed it.
[353:13.50]There's just dead cigarette for the entire length of the cigarette.
[353:17.44]You have to ash it.
[353:18.48]I'm just dead.
[353:21.85]I'm a burnt out cigarette right now.
[353:27.81]That was a weird analogy.
[353:28.83]Can you tell that I'm burnt out?
[353:31.16]What did I just say?
[353:31.70]I have a cigarette ash when you drag it all the way and you add it.
[353:35.56]But I haven't been ashed.
[353:42.49]Dusk was amazing.
[353:43.71]That was a really, really good game.
[353:49.03]But I'm spent.
[353:53.20]I'll see you guys in a couple days for The Outer Worlds.
[353:58.62]you don't have dusk see if you can beat my score level nine on endless mode of the farm put in the comments if you got there and what is your favorite weapon please make please give me engagements so there's like 30 000 comments in my comment section
[354:28.76]What's your favorite ice cream?
[354:30.68]Guaranteed to get like at least 15,000 comments.
[354:39.91]But.
[354:41.65]I am out of here.
[354:43.77]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[354:45.21]Thanks for watching as always.
[354:46.39]It was a blast.
[354:49.02]That game is fucking great.
[354:50.68]Highly recommend.
[354:55.80]There's a lot of content, too.
[354:58.06]That took a long time.
[354:59.14]That was six hours today.
[355:01.46]What?
[355:02.14]Five and a half?
[355:03.20]Four and a half hours yesterday?
[355:07.38]That's like a ten hour game.
[355:11.22]I did not expect it to be that long.
[355:17.32]Let's see.
[355:19.78]What do we got here?
[355:20.56]That's kind of loud.
[355:30.56]Yeah, I didn't try the challenge super impossible hard difficulty.
[355:34.97]I feel like I just wouldn't want to do it.
[355:40.65]You take one damage and you just die.
[355:42.77]I feel like I would be angry at that game.
[355:47.83]If you 100% every level, it's like 15 hours.
[355:49.85]That's a lot.
[355:53.27]I spent more time in dust than I did a lot of first, you know, AAA first party games that come out.
[356:01.92]12 hours yeah uh let's do the bits I'll see you guys in a few days thanks for watching as always let's get to it who's the who had the top bits let's see oh look at that oh look at that wait is this real it changed
[356:32.78]Is this for real?
[356:36.14]I don't think... was this from like three days ago?
[356:43.59]How could this be so incorrect?
[356:45.93]I don't understand.
[356:47.51]I don't think that's right, but thank you to all of you anyways.
[356:54.61]Let's go back to, uh, six hours ago we had cream corn, thanks for the 250.
[357:00.97]Hey Jerma, do you think we're going to get another Jerma Awards on New Year's Eve?
[357:03.69]It was my favorite stream last year.
[357:05.91]Reminiscing with Chad on the highlights of 2018 was a great way to close out the year.
[357:09.18]It'd be fun to do the same for 2019.
[357:12.10]Yes.
[357:13.92]There's going to be another stream awards.
[357:26.61]Why not?
[357:27.07]It was fun.
[357:29.35]It's fun to look back on what people nominate and what actually wins some of this stuff.
[357:37.25]Worst noise.
[357:40.94]I have in my mind what the worst noise is.
[357:45.02]It's definitely gonna win.
[357:47.48]There's no way it doesn't win.
[357:53.13]I can't even tell you what it is.
[357:54.55]I don't want to influence any voting, but if this is selectable, there's 100% no way that this loses to anything.
[358:09.84]Oh, it's making me laugh.
[358:15.08]Worst joke of the year, taking votes.
[358:16.50]Yeah, let's vote for the same categories.
[358:21.29]It should be a good time.
[358:24.65]Anyways, uh, yes.
[358:25.91]It's in the plans.
[358:29.35]But thank you for the 250.
[358:30.35]Thank you, the plushie, for the 500 bits.
[358:31.93]What's your opinion on pulp and orange juice?
[358:35.21]Uh, do not like.
[358:38.55]I don't... Do not like pulp in my orange juice.
[358:47.92]I also don't like pulp in lemonade.
[358:49.38]I know that's what some people say.
[358:50.50]I like pulp in lemonade, but not in orange juice.
[358:54.45]I disagree.
[358:59.49]Can you believe that they still sell heavy pulp?
[359:04.23]That shit was so gross.
[359:08.61]You can buy lots of pulp.
[359:16.05]That stuff just sits up on the shelf.
[359:20.78]Nobody buys that.
[359:24.09]No, you don't order orange juice like you order your peanut butter.
[359:30.88]But that's just my opinion.
[359:34.82]It's actually kind of hard to find because nobody buys it.
[359:42.48]I hate orange juice in my pulp.
[359:43.92]Well, that's weird.
[359:51.32]Jerma, you are a weak bitch.
[359:56.47]Somebody time that, somebody time that person out, please.
[360:02.17]Just like a... 15 seconds, that's all I'm looking for for that one.
[360:06.51]10 to 15 seconds.
[360:07.89]So they can sit there and really think about what they just said to me.
[360:13.31]No, because I agree.
[360:15.17]Hey!
[360:17.14]You're supposed to... What, you're going to defy the king?
[360:24.42]It ain't the king stream.
[360:25.40]It's not fuck the king yet.
[360:26.50]Not yet.
[360:32.03]Uh, no, I don't like pulp and orange juice.
[360:33.41]Thank you, Future Gamer, for the $2.50.
[360:36.13]What do you plan to do with Jerma985 and Second Jerma?
[360:39.17]With the new Copa stuff.
[360:41.97]You could get fined like $40,000 per video if they decide that you do not properly label your video as for kids.
[360:48.37]What?
[360:50.79]None of my videos are for kids.
[360:53.15]I feel like even TF2 videos could be interpreted as for kids just off the thumbnail of a colorful character.
[361:00.75]I'm not gonna get fined $400,000.
[361:06.72]It might be a good idea just to label all of them as for kids as a precaution.
[361:15.29]You mean not for kids.
[361:24.12]Um... Here's why that is not gonna ever happen.
[361:29.34]Because... What about the guy that uploaded a video... nine years ago?
[361:35.76]And he doesn't even know the password to his account anymore?
[361:39.08]And it's not for kids?
[361:40.42]And he doesn't even remember making the video?
[361:44.10]And they're gonna fine that guy $40,000?
[361:47.92]Fuck him?
[361:48.67]He goes to jail?
[361:59.68]No, YouTube is just... YouTube is a mess.
[362:07.66]You want to make a billion dollars?
[362:08.99]Anybody in here want to make like 500 million dollars?
[362:12.47]Raise your hand.
[362:12.85]Would you like to?
[362:13.59]I can tell you how.
[362:18.17]Just make a YouTube competitor that is only for children.
[362:25.86]Only.
[362:26.12]Only.
[362:29.67]Not YouTube Kids.
[362:31.05]No, no.
[362:31.53]Just like a children's learning center.
[362:34.65]That's just all videos.
[362:35.59]And you can just make educational videos for kids' video streaming site.
[362:47.77]If they're so concerned about this, why don't they have YouTube Kids be a separate uploader?
[362:55.70]If that's such a huge concern, separate the uploading.
[363:00.24]Make it so you have to upload a video to YouTube Kids.
[363:05.36]Why should a wacky boy upload videos just to YouTube and like, oh, whatever, who knows?
[363:17.03]I think I saw somebody talking about this the other day.
[363:21.20]And by the other day, I mean it could have been anywhere within the last three months.
[363:25.17]that if you want to go through all of the videos you've ever made and make changes to them, you're talking about dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of hours straight just to check a box.
[363:43.19]It would take forever.
[363:50.65]It would probably take you like 30 to 40, 50 plus hours just to check those boxes across, like if you had thousands of videos.
[364:04.72]They just want you to label your videos for not for kids.
[364:09.08]I... Yeah, guess what?
[364:12.48]Smoking is not for kids either.
[364:13.96]Somehow they end up doing it.
[364:20.34]How do I stop that?
[364:31.66]Not about endorsing child smoking, I'm just saying, like, how do I prevent someone from not clicking on a video?
[364:44.69]You know, kids aren't supposed to swear, but they do.
[364:53.91]If I upload a video to YouTube, I mean, yeah, I guess this video's not for kids.
[365:01.30]Go to your favorite porn website right now.
[365:04.20]Is there a thing that says, excuse me, you're not allowed to be here, yeah, click.
[365:08.36]What?
[365:13.31]That's all, that's the only thing that exists there.
[365:25.59]So what you're saying is we should blame the children.
[365:27.87]No, no, I'm just saying, like... I don't know who could or couldn't be watching my videos.
[365:36.04]If I'm gonna get, like, fined in quotes or whatever for somebody watching a video of mine from, like, seven years ago, I don't have any control over that.
[365:47.36]Should I just label my whole channel, like, not for kids, I guess?
[365:50.56]I could just do that.
[366:07.68]I don't want you to... Yeah, I just don't want you to get fined.
[366:11.84]I have to look into this, because that just seems strange.
[366:27.37]What about when... Okay, so what about when HBO shows a rerun of The Sopranos on your cable network?
[366:36.36]And your kid's in the room, and you don't know that they're watching it.
[366:41.44]Should we find HBO?
[366:50.30]HBO, how- what the fuck?
[366:58.95]It's all about the data collection.
[367:12.29]It's about advertising to kids, not kids seeing bad stuff.
[367:19.17]See, I think they just fucked it up from the very beginning instead of just separating it out completely from the very beginning.
[367:23.99]Because now you retroactively have billions of videos that are not suitable for anybody that just exist.
[367:43.77]It's about kids... It's about kids seeing completely shitty content.
[367:47.92]Oh, you're fucked, dude.
[367:59.82]But regardless, I don't know, I...
[368:03.95]I don't think I'm going to get in any trouble for it.
[368:08.35]I'm going to have to talk to Mac and go check on the channel or something and see what I would have to do.
[368:13.95]I don't know what I would even have to do.
[368:15.33]Watch VA ends up with a $100,000 fine.
[368:35.39]I don't know.
[368:35.67]We'll find out.
[368:36.15]We'll see.
[368:36.77]I don't think it's going to be that big of an issue.
[368:40.17]We'll see, though.
[368:54.29]But, let's move on.
[368:56.71]Interesting thought.
[368:58.10]Interesting conversation, though.
[369:04.30]Thank you, FutureGamer.
[369:05.56]Appreciate it.
[369:07.85]Propinator, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[369:12.39]I hope this is enough for a hangry pizza.
[369:15.81]I love pizza.
[369:17.45]It definitely is enough.
[369:19.42]I will absolutely use that for a pizza.
[369:25.50]Thank you so much for the 1500 bits.
[369:27.26]Appreciate that.
[369:29.90]Immanuel Depress, thanks for the 300 bits.
[369:32.70]I originally thought you had peaked with Shpi, but after long consideration, I've decided you have now peaked with Omega Pig.
[369:49.81]Omega Pig.
[369:54.87]True?
[369:55.63]What are you... True.
[369:59.02]SpookySpitfire, thanks for the $2.50.
[370:00.62]First, this is a pretty interesting game.
[370:03.32]Second, I just had to spend, like, $60 or $70 on The Binding of Isaac.
[370:07.74]Rebirth and Afterbirth, because PSN sucks ass.
[370:11.98]You have any recommendations aside from, like, never buying stuff from the PSN?
[370:21.63]Um, I don't, that's, you're covering a lot of bases on that one, so...
[370:27.92]That's all the advice I have.
[370:33.16]Why is it that much?
[370:34.04]$70?
[370:34.06]Is it really 70 bucks for everything on PSN?
[370:41.58]It seems like a lot.
[370:45.00]They don't have a complete edition?
[370:51.42]Probably not from the US.
[370:52.52]Oh, right, right.
[371:04.25]They probably had to buy it like three times.
[371:06.89]That's not good.
[371:10.79]Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[371:12.65]But thanks for the $2.55.
[371:14.52]Appreciate it.
[371:15.90]It's a great game.
[371:16.56]Is this the first time you're buying it?
[371:19.46]Because you've got a... That's a decade worth of content.
[371:23.96]That game is so much fun.
[371:25.56]Enjoy it.
[371:25.90]I've heard that's a very good game.
[371:27.66]Put it on the list.
[371:28.10]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[371:53.64]This is two different people with two different Isaac stories.
[371:55.92]You guys should talk to each other.
[372:26.28]No, it's not.
[372:26.52]It's the same person.
[372:28.98]This is the same person.
[372:32.14]Why is it listed as a different person here?
[372:35.30]It's the same person!
[372:39.25]Why are you a different person on my list here?
[372:42.27]What?
[372:42.59]Hold on.
[372:46.09]It's, yeah, twice right here.
[372:47.71]Okay, I had to refresh.
[372:55.10]That was quick.
[372:59.17]For a second I was like, holy shit, you guys should talk to each other.
[373:03.45]Anyways.
[373:07.75]Every single boss and floor, including Satan, it was beautiful.
[373:14.35]You just bought the game and you did that?
[373:16.79]Well, you've ruined the whole game for the rest of the time.
[373:22.51]You can never play Binding of Isaac ever again now.
[373:24.71]It'll never feel the same.
[373:25.85]You have to do that again.
[373:30.75]You're gonna get to Satan with... You're gonna get to Satan with, like, the magician tears, and you're gonna be really mad about it.
[373:43.70]There are plenty of broken builds.
[373:45.04]I know, I'm just fucking around.
[373:48.60]Give it the Jerma985 treatment.
[373:52.36]What?
[373:54.32]What are you talking about?
[373:58.89]Thank you.
[374:00.95]That's really cool to hear.
[374:02.29]If that's the first time you really played it.
[374:06.28]Grime, thanks for the $2.50.
[374:07.50]Thank you for all the laughs, Jerma.
[374:08.68]You're generally one of my favorite content creators of all time.
[374:11.72]That includes all of art, all of television, and all of movies.
[374:19.18]I will sit up there.
[374:19.92]That sounds... Thank you.
[374:21.60]I have my first job interview tomorrow, and I'll give you more money through a sub if I get the job.
[374:26.33]Hope you get it.
[374:28.60]Not for my sake at all, but for yours.
[374:35.25]I'm happy to be your favorite content creator.
[374:37.37]Thank you.
[374:38.93]Good luck.
[374:40.45]You'll be fine.
[374:40.75]You're going to get the job.
[374:41.75]Don't worry.
[374:45.59]Thank you.
[374:47.57]Creamcorn, thanks for the $2.50.
[374:48.71]Jerma, what's the lore behind you getting TTS to say Michael instead of singing it yourself?
[374:54.86]I think I explained it before.
[374:57.94]It's a joke about those tapes you could buy.
[375:02.25]Where it just says the kid's name.
[375:06.29]It sings a birthday song, and you can get a specialized custom... Oh, look!
[375:12.49]Let's say you have a kid, and the kid's name is John, right?
[375:16.92]It was a tape you could buy that you put in, and they had like a hundred of them.
[375:21.04]John!
[375:21.74]Jack!
[375:22.44]Jerry!
[375:23.12]Jeremy!
[375:24.55]And all it did was it sang the same song.
[375:28.57]And just replaced the kid's name with whatever name of the tape that you purchased.
[375:34.63]So you felt so special on your birthday.
[375:36.94]Because it was, hey, Jeremy.
[375:40.20]It's your birthday.
[375:42.00]Hey, Jeremy.
[375:43.52]And it was like, they're talking about me.
[375:45.28]They're talking about me right now.
[375:49.49]I think they still exist.
[375:50.25]They're on YouTube now.
[375:54.65]Go type in, like, birthday song for David.
[375:57.61]The same thing will happen.
[376:00.26]For instance.
[376:10.96]Okay.
[376:14.56]This one I just typed in.
[376:15.46]Is this exactly what I was talking about?
[376:17.00]Let's see what happens.
[376:35.84]I mean, this one's way cooler, but, uh, you get the idea.
[376:38.74]Here you go, here you go, here's another one.
[377:05.84]Okay, cool.
[377:08.20]That was good.
[377:09.42]I wonder what happens if I click on this one.
[377:36.89]Happy birthday, Tyler.
[377:43.64]What about this one?
[378:08.61]Happy birthday, Justin.
[378:10.35]How about this one?
[378:11.55]They're all the same.
[378:12.75]There's another one.
[378:14.95]Completely different YouTube channel.
[378:16.63]Completely different channel.
[378:17.57]Happy birthday to you.
[378:33.40]Happy birthday to you.
[378:41.36]Now you see in the world of YouTube, you can make these and technology has gotten a lot better.
[378:48.39]But back in the day,
[378:51.03]They just had one recording of the song, and the guy would be in the studio and just say a hundred names, and they would put that one piece in there.
[378:59.39]I'm not sure why they would do it that way.
[379:01.76]The guy didn't sing the song a thousand times.
[379:03.84]He just said a thousand names and sang the same song once.
[379:07.04]I think these people are actually singing the whole song every time, or it's very good editing.
[379:16.73]This is another channel, I think.
[379:17.91]No.
[379:24.53]It's cheaper and faster, that's right.
[379:26.73]Happy birthday, dear Gladys.
[379:30.63]Happy birthday, Gladys.
[379:31.43]So there you are.
[379:39.90]That's what it was.
[379:40.92]Let's see.
[379:59.84]Me?
[380:00.24]What?
[380:01.31]They're talking about me.
[380:25.11]And the kid would lose their mind because they thought that it was talking to them.
[380:29.91]It's the same reason why Dora was, oh, do you know where it is?
[380:33.13]Yeah, I do.
[380:34.19]You're talking to me through the screen.
[380:35.43]You just don't.
[380:36.07]You're like fucking seven.
[380:37.75]You're six.
[380:38.25]What the hell do you know?
[380:48.00]But let's get the credits on screen.
[380:51.96]Roll them.
[380:54.60]Hey, it's really good that those are YouTube kids friendly, right?
[380:57.22]They don't have to do anything, right?
[381:02.15]Thanks for subbing, everybody.
[381:17.68]If you still think people are talking to you through the screen and you're seven, you're not the brightest kid.
[381:24.09]I know, I'm just using like a random young kid number.
[381:28.88]Let's just say four.
[381:31.04]Or three.
[381:34.26]Yeah, seven is like second grade, isn't it?
[381:43.33]They're talking to me still.
[381:46.39]Yeah, you're probably old enough to know that that's not really happening.
[381:58.68]But that would thank you, CreamCorn, for the 250.
[381:59.92]There's your explanation.
[382:01.18]That's... I think I talked about it before, but that's what it's from.
[382:05.31]Dorkcube, thanks for the 250.
[382:06.33]I met an internet friend in real life today.
[382:10.57]Because it turns out we both go to the same school.
[382:13.81]That's a small world.
[382:14.97]We had no idea until recently.
[382:17.23]Anyways, he's also a big fan of you.
[382:23.91]Don't ever tell me the odds.
[382:26.07]That's really interesting.
[382:29.62]Both go to the same school and both watch this channel.
[382:36.25]He hasn't had the chance to watch recently.
[382:38.51]If you're watching tonight, klook.
[382:41.91]I hope you're able to make it through final with flying colors.
[382:47.05]Hope you did it.
[382:56.74]Thanks a lot.
[382:57.74]That's a really, really interesting story, actually.
[383:00.20]That's really cool to know.
[383:04.57]Thank you, Gnarly, for the 250.
[383:05.67]Glad to hear you're going to play Outer Worlds.
[383:07.23]I just beat it and had fun with it, just so you know.
[383:10.27]Chat will probably pressure you into doing a low intelligence run.
[383:13.97]Honestly, it's not that much of a detriment, so you can do it if you think it might be fun for a while.
[383:19.57]I don't know.
[383:23.38]We'll just see what happens.
[383:27.33]Let's see what happens.
[383:29.59]Caught up at near shoe thanks to the five subs.
[383:33.73]Son of Jenova thanks for the 250.
[383:34.53]Hey Jerma, wanted to ask you to play Blood Fresh Supply.
[383:37.66]It's a remaster of an old DOS FPS.
[383:41.02]Actually, when I was looking at AMID EVIL, it's another one I was looking at.
[383:45.94]And Doom also.
[383:49.10]The original Doom.
[383:52.93]But improved.
[383:54.83]Hypo is telling me
[383:57.12]About ways to make it widescreen and better so it's not as puke-inducing as it could be now.
[384:07.69]We were going to talk about it and see.
[384:08.85]We'll take a look.
[384:09.71]Yeah.
[384:10.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[384:15.93]Hey, Snooze and Copter, thanks for the $2.50.
[384:18.31]Jerma, how are you?
[384:19.05]We're friends, right?
[384:19.81]And friends borrow each other's money, right?
[384:21.45]Can you lend me $2.50?
[384:22.01]I could really need it.
[384:26.62]Thanks.
[384:30.50]Well, I have no way to send this back to you.
[384:34.15]Also, I heard you wanted to play Death Stranding off stream.
[384:36.69]Did you?
[384:37.01]What's your opinion?
[384:39.89]My opinion?
[384:40.37]I'll give you the real one.
[384:41.69]The real opinion.
[384:43.70]I am... Yeah, I'm not going to play Death Stranding on stream.
[384:51.86]It's too long for me to want to play it on stream, I think.
[385:02.48]I've it's like a 40 plus hour experience and I don't the gameplay looks fun it looks cool but I don't think I want to do that for 30 hours I've heard it's fantastic though but that's something I probably would do in my own leisure time
[385:31.18]Even if, I don't know, maybe I don't even have enough time to even sit down and play it.
[385:35.64]I tried to play through God of War off stream and I got to maybe 10, 12 hours in and almost 15 hours in and I kind of stopped there.
[385:51.05]I could see playing Death Stranding.
[385:55.67]Pick it up once a week and play it for a couple hours and just deliver some packages and do that for a long time until the game's done.
[386:07.47]That you won't see it on stream.
[386:09.57]I don't think so.
[386:10.34]Not at all.
[386:12.94]But thank you, SnoozingCopter.
[386:16.74]Thank you.
[386:20.69]I feel like it's right up your alley.
[386:21.55]I just like the game a lot.
[386:22.57]Also, does anyone else hear birthday music or am I going crazy?
[386:24.43]I've heard it's very good.
[386:26.81]But I don't know if I'll stream it.
[386:28.50]Not now.
[386:29.36]Maybe.
[386:52.23]There's a lot coming up here.
[386:53.21]There's a lot coming up in the next few weeks.
[387:02.16]Maybe, maybe soon.
[387:03.38]Maybe in the new year.
[387:09.91]5G birthday?
[387:15.14]But I appreciate it, though.
[387:16.86]Maybe you'll see that somewhere in, like, early 2020.
[387:19.10]That's one of those games that's going to be forever on the list until I get bullied into playing it.
[387:28.10]But I do want to.
[387:32.46]And finally, Spooky Spitfire.
[387:37.19]Back again here with 250.
[387:38.51]Thank you, Spooky.
[387:42.03]Well, he transitioned to the end of the stream.
[387:44.10]Just an FYI, I've gotten every achievement pre-Afterbirth and Isaac on my computer.
[387:48.24]Oh, okay.
[387:48.56]There we go.
[387:50.76]But it's currently broken, so I was just like, dude, what do you mean this run is god tier?
[387:55.32]LOL, also, I know it's old and you have already played it on stream, but chat is nuts and forced you to quit it early.
[388:02.83]But you should beat Hollow Knight off stream.
[388:04.67]Tell me how the Path of Pain treats you.
[388:17.27]Hollow Knight was good.
[388:21.05]But Hollow Knight was... That was also kind of back when... I never streamed a game more than once or twice in a row.
[388:35.74]The new one's coming out soon, too.
[388:39.40]It was really good.
[388:40.32]Yeah, I know.
[388:43.22]It's just lost forever.
[388:47.49]Soon?
[388:47.93]Is it not soon?
[388:49.47]Wasn't it 2020?
[388:49.83]Like, early 2020?
[388:50.77]It's TBA.
[388:57.26]Oh, okay.
[389:04.70]Well, we'll see when it comes out.
[389:08.73]But I probably will end up just... Because I have to play through Hollow Knight before I do the sequel.
[389:13.07]You can't just... Wait, you're going to watch...
[389:16.27]You're gonna watch the movie's sequel before you see the movie's prequel?
[389:21.82]What?
[389:22.30]No.
[389:24.36]The movie's sequel before you watch the first one.
[389:27.10]Of course you would watch the sequel before the... Well, did the prequel come out... When did the prequel come out?
[389:38.56]If there was a visual representation of my brain right now, it would be a single hair.
[389:46.42]In a giant, dark room.
[389:49.40]And on the tip of the hair is a little flake of fire.
[389:53.79]Just about to go out.
[389:56.19]Just... Six hours ago, it was a blaze in there.
[390:04.23]There was wood stacked up really high.
[390:10.31]Playing games like that just drain me.
[390:12.85]They drain my whole fucking psyche.
[390:17.40]What are my thoughts on the Mandalorian?
[390:18.60]I think it's amazing.
[390:22.75]I think it's some of the best Star Wars content we've gotten this decade.
[390:26.45]I think it's fantastic.
[390:41.44]Real shit?
[390:42.30]Yeah, no, I really do.
[390:43.66]I think it was really, really good.
[390:48.72]Spoilers?
[390:49.52]No, don't say spoilers.
[390:52.96]Let people enjoy it, because it's great.
[390:55.28]But that's my time.
[390:55.88]I'll see you guys soon.

[391:04.17]Go get it.
[391:05.23]It's a great game.
