[00:02.85]Oh, you're in big trouble.
[00:04.55]You're in big trouble.
[00:07.51]Are you?
[00:07.91]Wow.
[00:22.30]The sea is still this morning.
[00:24.66]The fresh pine scent fills the air, and the shining sun beats down on the newly crafted pyro shark nest.
[00:32.33]She will need to be careful, though, for predators lurk around every corner.
[00:37.51]The winter months are always the most difficult for pyro sharks, so the summer sun gives them plenty of time for the necessary hunt.
[00:47.63]The food is scarce, and the coming months will be grueling.
[00:52.47]But the incredibly strong will and sheer cunning of this young female might just help this endangered beast to another spring.
[01:15.97]Our first journey begins in Lakeside.
[01:19.61]This small, quaint pool houses quite a large surprise.
[01:25.29]Weighing in at over 12,000 pounds, the Pool Room Pyro Shark is a wonder to behold.
[01:33.12]The graceful swimming technique known as unguntu has been passed down from generation to generation.
[01:40.48]Now, as one could probably imagine, this particular breed likes to be alone and does not take kindly to would-be encroachers.
[01:49.28]This pool is not big enough to house more than one pyro shark, unless, of course, he happens to be mating.
[01:57.85]Unfortunately, most pool room pyro sharks do not make it out of this pool because of their own laziness.
[02:05.99]Frequent sniper and spy attacks kill most of them.
[02:11.38]Hopefully, the others will survive.
[02:16.64]Welcome to the shark tank.
[02:20.77]Oh, you didn't think that there was a shark tank in Lakeside.
[02:25.51]Well, I mean, there is now.
[02:28.31]Here we go.
[02:29.55]I think I see some prey.
[02:31.85]You're just drowning.
[02:36.54]Get out of here, sharks.
[02:38.36]These are shark-less waters.
[02:42.40]Got him.
[02:43.36]Got him.
[02:43.88]Swarmed him.
[02:45.40]These are shark-less waters.
[02:50.30]I need the health- Oh, there's a lot- There's a bunch of people.
[02:52.92]There's a bunch of people.
[02:54.42]Come on, somebody jump in here.
[02:56.00]No!
[02:56.42]No!
[02:57.22]I'm getting shot at.
[02:58.42]Jerma!
[02:59.04]Jerma!
[02:59.72]Jerma!
[03:00.02]Help me!
[03:00.40]No, don't die!
[03:01.10]No!
[03:02.72]You were my shark, brother!
[03:06.26]So, how is our lovely two-fort swamp pyroshock doing, you ask?
[03:11.94]As happy as can be.
[03:14.02]It is a lovely day, and the forecast calls for clear skies and calm waters.
[03:20.86]Striking with ferocity and quickness is all in the pyro shark's repertoire.
[03:25.82]And their favorite food source is the skewt.
[03:29.13]The skewt is so full of tender meat and morsels dripping with bone marrow, it is the pyro shark's favorite.
[03:35.77]Next to, of course, probably, the sphinx.
[03:39.59]The two-foot swamp shark only lives to be about four years old.
[03:43.83]Time is of the essence.
[03:45.63]Spy checking, food gathering, and territorial guarding need to be done quickly.
[03:50.68]They will spend most of their few days in these sewers, so they need to spend them wisely.
[03:56.52]And what's this?
[03:57.96]A wild skilt showing himself to our young little friend?
[04:02.05]This could mean more rations during the winter.
[04:04.99]Be careful, young shark.
[04:06.85]The skilt is known to be a fast runner and could lead you into a trap.
[04:11.33]This skilt seems to want to lead our little friend out of the water, which is very, very dangerous indeed.
[04:18.22]Pyro sharks have trouble breathing outside the swamp.
[04:21.85]So another time, another day.
[04:25.63]Now this is a treat indeed.
[04:28.77]It's not often we get to see the sawmill pyro shark.
[04:32.38]We caught this one during its bathing hour, drinking up the cool, crisp water, cleansing his sun-battered skin.
[04:41.88]Sawmill sharks are a quiet breed, although highly aggressive.
[04:46.45]Their main source of food is the solly bird.
[04:49.65]Solly birds fly from peak to peak in search of their favorite health pack snack.
[04:54.28]The sawmill shark knows this and uses deceit and cunning to lay a goo-covered sticky trap in place of the bird's favorite meal.
[05:03.24]Once the bird is consumed, it's back to the bath and to spend the rest of the day in relaxation.
[05:13.19]And before we go, do you remember that little skilt that was giving our two-foot Pyro Shark some trouble?
[05:19.51]Well, if there's one thing you need to know about the Pyro Shark, it's very simple.
[05:24.66]They always get their kill.
[05:30.32]Always.
[05:32.21]So it seems this pyro shark will continue on through the spring and pass her lineage down another generation.
[05:42.07]Take care, everybody.
[05:43.87]Good night.
