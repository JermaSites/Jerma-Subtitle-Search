[05:51.45]Somebody said, dude, you ruined your career with this.
[06:03.27]I was thinking though, can you imagine, if you imagine just blowing ass that hard in the shower, that's too, geez, man.
[06:16.55]My goodness.
[06:24.82]Just boom!
[06:26.00]Alright.
[06:27.72]Let me change the title.
[06:28.44]Let me make a tweet.
[06:29.95]I think you guys are going to like my tweet.
[06:31.51]My tweet, it's a banger tweet.
[06:32.97]I think you guys are actually going to really like it.
[06:37.33]I'm going to name the title of the stream.
[06:42.93]You'll see.
[06:44.34]It's a banger tweet.
[06:45.14]You're going to like it.
[06:48.66]I want a live...
[06:52.70]reaction to the tweet, to the sponsor tweet.
[06:57.13]I feel like you guys are going to like it.
[06:58.71]You ready?
[07:05.57]People thought I actually, that I forgot to mute.
[07:07.79]Oh, that's funny.
[07:08.26]Alright, here we go.
[07:12.08]Here comes the tweet.
[07:13.92]Go read it.
[07:25.76]What do you think?
[07:29.04]What do you think?
[07:42.61]That's pretty funny.
[07:43.45]Do you get it?
[07:51.47]Because of the Latin thing that I didn't know?
[07:53.93]Come on.
[08:00.96]Not even ironically funny.
[08:03.42]Hey.
[08:03.72]Alright, let's get a good title.
[08:09.14]Summa cum laude.
[08:12.06]Here we come.
[08:12.88]Hashtag.
[08:24.68]You lost all the plus twos I got.
[08:26.24]That's that's not fair.
[08:28.37]It really isn't.
[08:34.41]Hold on, let me make sure I get this right.
[08:38.40]Mm-hmm.
[08:42.00]You farmed plus twos for the last two and a half hours and now they're gone.
[08:48.66]No, it's just everyone wants to give me shit.
[08:53.02]That's fine.
[08:54.24]You want to give me shit?
[08:59.40]That's not a shower.
[09:02.22]That's the menu.
[09:07.28]Okay.
[09:09.99]Hi, Professor Jerma.
[09:11.27]Hey, thanks.
[09:18.39]Alright.
[09:18.77]Let me make sure I turn this on.
[09:20.21]It should be on now.
[09:23.37]Cool.
[09:25.59]Make sure I turn this on.
[09:26.89]Mm-hmm.
[09:38.95]Okay.
[09:45.55]Okay.
[09:48.19]Is that?
[09:48.43]Okay, summa cum laude.
[09:50.04]Here we come.
[09:50.66]Is that a good one?
[09:54.08]I think it's pretty good.
[10:02.75]I think that's fun.
[10:10.99]That's fun.
[10:11.49]Alright.
[10:25.69]But yeah, in all seriousness, no fucking around.
[10:28.32]We are going to be playing Two Point Campus on stream today.
[10:31.56]It is going to be an ad stream.
[10:37.46]Well, the game actually looks really fun.
[10:38.82]I actually want to play it, so
[10:43.00]Seems like it's pretty fun.
[10:45.06]Let's go for it.
[10:46.92]You guys ready?
[10:48.95]I'm opening it now.
[10:52.61]I've heard good things.
[11:00.25]I've heard good things.
[11:09.98]Was the Black Ops 2 stream sponsored?
[11:12.60]Why would a Black Ops 2 stream be sponsored by a 10-year-old game?
[11:17.54]Alright, let me make sure this is still here.
[11:25.32]It is, alright.
[11:30.40]So by the same people that made Two Point Hospital.
[11:33.06]We played that, if you remember.
[11:33.98]I remember having a good time with that.
[11:43.90]Okay.
[11:55.86]Alright.
[11:56.40]I'll put the camera on, I promise.
[11:57.58]Alright, let's go.
[12:02.50]Alright, let's go.
[12:05.96]I will put the camera on.
[12:18.77]See?
[12:19.67]A man of my word.
[12:21.03]And I'm freshly showered.
[12:22.99]And by freshly showered, I mean I threw a little bit of water in my face.
[12:26.59]And that's it.
[12:30.34]I definitely look a little less greasy, though, don't you think?
[12:33.66]I look clean, don't I?
[12:34.44]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[12:41.18]Are you ready to go?
[12:41.86]Okay, two-point campus!
[12:49.24]New game?
[13:04.65]What is going on in this school?
[13:07.71]Wait, you can be a clown?
[13:14.82]What is happening here?
[13:23.94]If I can make a clown college, that is what I'm doing.
[13:27.32]Without a doubt, that's what I'm doing.
[13:37.77]Two-point hospital was fun.
[13:43.51]I guess you can build a whole campus, too.
[13:46.01]You can do the whole outdoor area, everything.
[13:48.13]So, it could be fun.
[13:55.71]What?
[13:56.93]Why did that building just shake?
[13:57.92]Alright, so address, select a member of staff.
[14:05.14]I'm Albert Crank, your own per, wait, this, unplug this.
[14:10.36]Your own personal advisor, and I'm here to help.
[14:14.96]You may, may not have an experience as a campus administrator, but the people at Fresh Lake County College are eager to give you a chance.
[14:22.98]I, I didn't scam anybody.
[14:26.65]I'm not sure what that says about them, but hey, let's head to Fresh Lay Meadows and get started on your academic empire.
[14:33.99]Hashtag advertisement.
[14:37.57]This actually is probably going to be fun.
[14:38.67]Alright, this countryside college has low expectations and a nice canal.
[14:42.43]It's a perfect place for you to start your career.
[14:43.63]Alright.
[14:45.01]Let's go.
[14:48.54]Campus Management 101.
[14:49.88]Is that the school mascot?
[14:57.97]A university is not something that one simply opens like a savings account or a jar of pickles.
[15:05.39]Any self-respecting academic institution was doubtlessly opened long ago by dignified people who wore bowler hats and spoke via subtitle.
[15:16.84]The world is a creation of the past and it is our job to keep it all going and try not to touch anything.
[15:26.23]Stewie Griffin.
[15:28.79]Alright, it looks really nice.
[15:30.35]The graphics are beautiful.
[15:33.74]I thought that said Scientology.
[15:37.26]Alright, first day of school.
[15:40.50]Welcome to Fresh Lake Meadows, where life moves slowly and expectations are lowly.
[15:45.22]The Two Point Countryside is the perfect place to start your career.
[15:48.16]Learn the ropes, make mistakes, and hit the ground smiling.
[15:52.55]Scientography.
[15:54.63]10 students, alright.
[15:57.94]Alright.
[16:02.53]There's no school.
[16:03.79]It's just an auditorium.
[16:06.73]Okay.
[16:07.85]I learned the basics of campus management.
[16:10.23]Try moving the camera and have a look around.
[16:11.75]You got it.
[16:12.43]Okay.
[16:16.21]Okay.
[16:21.11]Zoom the camera.
[16:21.77]Pan the camera.
[16:22.49]Sure.
[16:26.73]Spin the camera, pitch the camera, R and F. Oh, okay, I see.
[16:35.69]He's desynced?
[16:37.91]Shouldn't be.
[16:41.67]Okay, so our campus is going to be running a Scientography course.
[16:45.21]Let's start by building a science lab.
[16:46.77]Okay, 18,000, that sounds fine.
[16:50.63]Alright, so it should probably be in the corner.
[16:57.03]How big should it be?
[16:57.65]Should it be huge?
[16:59.55]I don't think it needs to be that big.
[17:07.30]Five by five?
[17:07.86]Okay, so it's a science lab.
[17:10.58]Let's put a door here.
[17:11.22]This is actually way too small.
[17:17.83]Okay.
[17:23.56]I got it.
[17:23.86]Do you want to sell one invalid item?
[17:27.21]Wait, no, what?
[17:29.85]What's invalid?
[17:32.19]Make the entire school a cafeteria.
[17:39.15]Um, yeah.
[17:41.91]Okay, cool.
[17:42.27]There we go.
[17:42.57]Let's hire a teacher.
[17:43.89]The dabbing.
[17:54.51]Okay, Toby Eastgate is going to be our Scientography streamer.
[17:59.11]I'm not a streamer.
[18:01.06]I can't speech jam myself with this audio.
[18:04.62]Okay, 70% teaching skill, excellent personal hygiene, toilet comfort decreases slower than most, and dives headfirst.
[18:12.78]Alright.
[18:14.18]Sir Nigel Bickleworth.
[18:17.21]Cheers.
[18:17.91]Cheers.
[18:22.19]Did you say he can't work in the science lab?
[18:25.31]Wait, we only have one course?
[18:26.49]Where's he going?
[18:27.49]Where are you going?
[18:48.56]Where are you going?
[18:49.96]We have to start the school year.
[18:52.56]It's not your year.
[18:54.12]It's just another year.
[18:57.37]Where's this guy going?
[19:00.29]The students are about to arrive and this guy's walking around on acid in the front lawn.
[19:04.27]Here come the students.
[19:09.13]Now taking students for Scientography.
[19:22.09]Okay.
[19:25.49]Why are we all going the long way?
[19:27.05]That's easier to go in there.
[19:28.09]Oh, I guess it's closer.
[19:32.41]He's the teacher.
[19:33.03]It's closer.
[19:35.60]Okay.
[19:40.22]Wait, do we do the class in here?
[19:43.46]What's this for?
[19:48.14]There are no seats.
[19:53.65]Oh, okay, here they go.
[19:55.96]They're in their first class.
[19:59.66]First day.
[20:00.10]There's no place to sit down.
[20:03.66]Hey, put those down.
[20:16.07]This is dangerous.
[20:24.45]We just make cubes?
[20:26.03]There are no seats and there's no desks.
[20:30.27]Okay, the students learn experience points.
[20:33.60]Increase their academic level.
[20:35.82]Okay.
[20:40.76]Where's the teacher?
[20:44.68]What are they making?
[20:45.28]They're making gas.
[20:48.54]That's not abnormal.
[20:52.71]Oh, by the way, Two Point Campus is across all major platforms.
[20:57.14]You can get it on PC.
[20:58.28]You can get it on PlayStation.
[20:59.48]You can get it on Xbox.
[21:00.84]You can get it on everything.
[21:08.78]Alright, so it's almost done.
[21:09.46]You're almost wearing any gloves.
[21:22.22]Feels fine.
[21:22.88]Squeaky clean.
[21:23.68]Iron black.
[21:26.46]We'll be talking about a modern beat combo.
[21:29.68]A group that call themselves the Helium Baboons.
[21:32.38]Did you get chin extensions?
[21:34.18]I must admit, while it may not be my usual cup of beef tea, for contemporary mindlessness, and that's what this is, it was not as bad as most of today's dirge and drivel.
[21:46.30]Helium Baboons.
[21:47.66]Not as bad as I feared they would be.
[21:49.26]This camera sucks, okay?
[21:50.92]Out of a possible five.
[21:52.64]Okay, class is over.
[21:54.82]They passed the first class.
[21:57.91]Sadly, they didn't do all that well.
[21:59.73]It seems a number of them were distracted by one need or another.
[22:04.01]What?
[22:05.59]What are they doing?
[22:07.89]Student that has everything they need will be more happy, less distracted, and be able to focus on their studies in an enthusiastic and cheerful haze.
[22:17.86]Not happy.
[22:19.90]Students' needs such as their thirst or toilet comfort will affect their overall happiness.
[22:24.29]Happy students perform better in classes and earn more XP.
[22:26.53]Okay.
[22:27.87]Take a look at our campus.
[22:29.47]Take a look at our students and see what we can do to improve the campus.
[22:32.47]Stop making me feel, uh, telling me how many consoles this game is on.
[22:40.92]I only own two and you're making me feel jealous of other people's possessions.
[22:45.22]Bro, you own two of the, you own two of the current gen consoles?
[22:51.98]What?
[22:53.30]Okay.
[22:54.78]Okay, we need bathroom.
[22:56.74]Tired.
[23:00.50]The key to campus hospitality is remember the three Rs.
[23:03.94]Students need somewhere to relax, rest themselves, and relieve themselves.
[23:08.39]Sure, two of those might be the same thing, but it does sound convincing.
[23:11.82]Let's build a dormitory and a bathroom to keep people comfortable.
[23:16.16]This poor kid.
[23:18.10]Okay, I need to build a dorm.
[23:20.48]Build a dorm.
[23:22.40]Dormitory.
[23:27.91]How many, how big, it's gotta be big, right?
[23:29.71]Can I make the campus bigger?
[23:38.02]It's gotta be a lot.
[23:43.59]Shit.
[23:44.15]How do I fix that?
[23:47.35]I need to fix that.
[23:51.07]Um, okay.
[23:55.15]Okay, place an item.
[23:56.65]You can rotate it.
[24:19.92]This is like a fucking hospital.
[24:23.03]This turned into a barracks.
[24:43.08]How many beds do I have to have?
[24:44.93]What?
[24:45.97]Why am I... Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[24:53.06]Oh shit, I thought it was tutorialing me.
[24:55.52]Alright, I thought I was getting tutorialed.
[24:57.36]Like, oh!
[24:58.08]Because remember I put the door down.
[24:59.72]I put the wardrobe down.
[25:01.20]Put the bed... It selected it for me.
[25:03.34]It selected it for me.
[25:03.98]Okay.
[25:04.14]I need a... ATM?
[25:04.51]Okay.
[25:18.68]Everybody gets a hand sanitizer next to their bed.
[25:19.82]Where's the bathroom?
[25:20.38]Alright, where's the bathroom?
[25:21.30]Do not cancel this room.
[25:22.08]Okay, we good?
[25:50.32]Dormitories are a great place for students to relax when they're low on energy.
[25:52.84]One bed between five students is considered normal on campus.
[26:00.71]What?
[26:12.05]Okay.
[26:14.99]Students may dream of having their own bed, but they'll happily share with a few friends.
[26:18.96]What are you talking about?
[26:23.84]They don't get in at the same time.
[26:27.50]Who gets into a bed like that?
[26:30.74]That's a weird person.
[26:33.60]That's a weird person.
[26:35.36]Who gets into a bed long ways?
[26:37.26]Nobody.
[26:37.72]Oh, there's only one wardrobe.
[26:41.90]Why are there bones in there?
[26:44.34]Why is there a dead body in there?
[26:47.72]Why are there a dead body in there?
[26:50.47]Alright, hold on.
[26:51.35]I'm confused.
[26:52.45]I need a bathroom.
[27:02.30]Okay.
[27:10.86]Okay, sink.
[27:13.40]Okay.
[27:17.62]Uh, hairdryer, hand dryer.
[27:19.04]Uh, plant.
[27:25.54]And sanitizations.
[27:26.30]Okay.
[27:30.25]And a window.
[27:30.89]No, what?
[27:31.23]Why would they put a window?
[27:33.69]Put in some slot machine.
[27:35.84]OK, bathroom done.
[27:42.82]New room unlock shower room.
[27:47.63]Did you hear that?
[27:48.17]I think our students might be hungry.
[27:50.79]Traditionally campuses offer a range of food and drink to, you know, sustain life.
[27:54.53]Let's add some vending machines.
[28:02.90]That guy... That guy didn't make it.
[28:10.40]Wait, you just went to the bathroom.
[28:11.56]Why are you still holding your stomach?
[28:15.50]This person... Why are they doing this?
[28:19.57]Why does everybody have diarrhea?
[28:21.55]What happened?
[28:22.25]Everyone's holding their stomachs?
[28:28.15]Oh, they're hungry.
[28:29.11]Okay, right, right, right, right.
[28:30.25]That's my bad.
[28:33.02]Okay, um... How do I get food?
[28:39.96]Oh, okay, here we go.
[28:42.61]Cheesy Gubbins machine.
[28:44.11]I don't have to go far.
[28:59.94]Alright.
[29:07.73]If it were up to the students, I'm sure we'd be all living in our own filth.
[29:10.83]They have very little say in the matter.
[29:12.19]Let's hire a janitor and place a bin.
[29:15.87]Okay.
[29:20.71]Jackie Clear.
[29:21.75]Wait, these are teachers.
[29:24.99]Jeff Vacuum.
[29:26.05]That's a great, great janitor name.
[29:29.68]Jeff Vacuum, I think, is the one that we hire.
[29:32.96]Okay.
[29:40.49]There's a drink stand right here.
[29:41.55]You're good.
[29:42.39]You're fine.
[29:46.95]Okay, so place one bin.
[29:49.73]Alright, you got it.
[29:56.93]No unauthorized talking on campus.
[30:02.21]No unauthorized talking?
[30:13.85]Okay, let's see how the students do in the next class.
[30:21.02]Oh shit, alright, now we're doing a lecture.
[30:32.89]Pass a Scientography class with a C+.
[30:35.95]What do you got for grades?
[30:41.78]Bursting.
[30:42.68]Feeling freshly peckish, thirsty, tired, bursting, and bored.
[30:47.98]Oh.
[30:55.27]Where are the rest of the students?
[31:08.21]Absolutely bursting.
[31:11.48]Tired, peckish, and thirsty.
[31:12.92]So, go to the bathroom.
[31:20.12]That's funny that there's bursting and absolutely bursting.
[31:24.04]That's different.
[31:35.02]Everyone's sleeping in the same two beds.
[31:41.05]They're just sharing these two beds.
[31:42.43]I don't need these many.
[31:49.82]Okay, what are you... who are you?
[31:52.60]This is the class clown.
[31:53.66]Makes things nice and cheery with a steady stream of jokes and slapstick delights.
[31:57.98]The class is just an audience that keeps coming back.
[32:01.19]Keeps people entertained and has poor hygiene.
[32:06.35]I love this guy.
[32:10.50]Let's see.
[32:10.88]Tell me a joke.
[32:11.42]Oh, there we go.
[32:15.40]The better they do, the more money you'll have to fund the campus.
[32:18.00]Who's smart now?
[32:20.43]Yes, you get tuition fees from all students enrolled in courses at the campus, as well as a bonus for how much XP they're earning.
[32:25.87]Sick, alright.
[32:29.45]What?
[32:30.99]Studying.
[32:32.13]Okay, I need a place to study.
[32:34.72]Completing assignments is a great way for students to earn XP away from the classroom, though it looks like they need...
[32:46.65]Are they throwing just trash down on the ground here?
[32:54.28]You're a faculty, man.
[32:55.62]Pick that up.
[32:56.26]You're setting a really bad example for all these fucking kids.
[33:00.14]What are you doing?
[33:00.68]Why would you do that?
[33:04.34]Okay, check your inbox to see what they need.
[33:11.87]Alright.
[33:12.19]This is the check on request.
[33:14.73]Library requested.
[33:17.90]Okay, Henrietta Belcher has requested a library and nine people have agreed on Facebook or whatever social media.
[33:27.58]I'm running out of room.
[33:39.89]Frequently asked questions.
[33:42.41]No, I've not seen your frog.
[33:46.38]How do I make the room bigger?
[33:47.62]How do I make this room bigger?
[33:48.36]Try it again.
[33:55.71]Library.
[34:00.69]That looks good.
[34:03.33]Alright, let's put this here.
[34:07.18]There.
[34:08.32]See how it's doing it?
[34:09.48]Okay, I got everything I need.
[34:11.98]I'll do one more bookshelf over here.
[34:16.17]And hand sanitizer.
[34:18.69]And a trash can.
[34:22.61]And... That's good.
[34:24.49]Alright, done.
[34:28.07]Complete an assignment in the library.
[34:29.69]You got it.
[34:32.63]What's that icon?
[34:33.05]Can I just sell all this stuff?
[34:37.43]I don't... I mean... Students are reminded to have the time of their lives.
[34:46.80]Oh, this dormitory sucks.
[34:47.93]I can't believe they're removing the beds.
[34:50.47]Oh, what's that?
[34:51.59]We're all sleeping in the same two beds, and we have... These have been, like, fresh, cleaned beds that no one's touched.
[34:59.94]And I'm getting points removed for that.
[35:08.62]Move this.
[35:13.01]That's fine.
[35:17.06]I'm going to pull the room over a little.
[35:18.56]It doesn't have to be this big.
[35:25.47]What?
[35:27.67]Oh, it's a copy.
[35:28.95]I thought it was move.
[35:30.81]My respect for those that choose chivalric and nightly pursuits.
[35:35.19]Well, it's really very large.
[35:37.31]The Bickleworths, after all, come from a rich and prestigious line of people on and near horses.
[35:44.63]That being said, feudal aristocracy used their hands far too much for my liking.
[35:51.12]The swordsmanship, the adventuring, have you ever held a lance?
[35:56.80]If you're so important, why are you doing all that work?
[36:00.50]I want to pull this in.
[36:02.86]Like that, right?
[36:07.52]Subtract, right?
[36:09.94]Alright, subtract it.
[36:13.70]Much better.
[36:14.06]Alright, that's fine.
[36:15.48]That's more realistic now.
[36:18.88]Although it's not very much room for whatever.
[36:20.24]Maybe like a food place or something?
[36:23.61]Get the banner?
[36:24.23]Okay, I need to hire an assistant.
[36:27.27]Open the hire staff menu to view applicants.
[36:31.21]Full of staff for different jobs.
[36:32.27]New applicants will apply.
[36:33.17]Okay, so I need an assistant.
[36:38.17]Assistant.
[36:39.41]Oh, that's for the library.
[36:40.29]Shit.
[36:40.51]Okay.
[36:44.78]Okay.
[36:45.80]Makes happiness.
[36:47.30]Brings happiness.
[36:47.94]What does this bring?
[36:49.40]Comedic timing?
[36:51.04]Yeah.
[36:52.90]Moves fast and is really clean.
[36:56.24]Yeah, for sure.
[37:01.54]Alright, okay.
[37:02.57]You're good.
[37:03.67]Open the library.
[37:06.03]Students are reminded that there's no such thing as free time.
[37:12.57]Oh, there he is.
[37:13.49]Alright, we gotta make sure this student gets an A+.
[37:19.28]Several students are completing an assignment in the library.
[37:22.14]Great way to earn XP outside the classroom.
[37:23.96]Cool.
[37:26.81]What's your schedule?
[37:31.12]You got science here in January?
[37:34.41]Hold on.
[37:36.79]You have one class in January.
[37:39.97]And you're just going to stay here from like August through July?
[37:43.89]A full year?
[37:45.23]You got one class.
[37:47.50]I need more than one class.
[37:52.04]No wonder everyone's walking around aimlessly.
[37:53.68]There's only one piece of curriculum and one teacher.
[37:59.34]Oh, shit.
[38:00.10]Alright.
[38:02.01]There's only one class.
[38:04.17]Stay on campus for a year and go to class for one week.
[38:07.99]Alright, let's go.
[38:13.63]It's a tutorial.
[38:14.49]Let's wait till we get to build our own ship.
[38:20.31]Apparently there's a relationship system.
[38:23.47]Which, I wonder how that works.
[38:25.01]I'm very curious.
[38:31.60]The bathroom's bigger than the library.
[38:36.36]Yeah.
[38:39.43]Everybody needs to go to the bathroom.
[38:41.59]Everybody doesn't study.
[38:42.55]Do you need me to explain that further?
[38:44.99]Maybe she... Alright, pass a sign... I keep... almost... Scientography class.
[38:59.61]They're gonna get B look at they're doing pretty good.
[39:01.27]Oh wait.
[39:02.33]There's the Joker What's wrong?
[39:18.31]What did he do?
[39:19.17]What did he do?
[39:19.53]What did he do?
[39:19.83]Why is there three?
[39:20.61]I don't get it.
[39:21.17]What happened?
[39:21.93]Oh, they're bored.
[39:22.69]Bored.
[39:53.62]Just get a B, and we'll be fine.
[40:00.16]Hired.
[40:01.08]How do I make a... Is there a... Do the teachers go home?
[40:07.24]Statement, okay.
[40:09.10]Tuition fees, rent, XP bonus, and then staff wages.
[40:12.92]Alright, cool.
[40:13.92]Seven grand.
[40:15.52]Alright, we're good.
[40:16.10]This is a test announcement, not a real announcement.
[40:23.02]So can this be used for more than just the science class?
[40:30.96]Nice.
[40:32.00]I would give you... Okay, if you had a B+, you'd get an A-.
[40:35.76]If I looked up... If I'm the teacher and I look out the window, and you got like an 88 or like an 89 on this exam here, and I see you doing those funny movements out the window, just kind of dancing around, I'm turning it into a 91.
[40:49.70]I'm making it a 91.
[40:53.49]Your students have gone from C-grade chumps to B-grade brainheads.
[40:56.82]Let's recap how you did.
[41:00.72]Alright, tutorial over.
[41:01.86]Provide better staff and facilities to improve your students' grades.
[41:07.50]Make students happy and comfortable to increase their learning rate.
[41:10.28]Earn more cash by growing your campus and enrolling more students.
[41:14.15]Alright.
[41:18.85]Spend kudos to unlock new items as well as staff, outfits, and interior design options.
[41:24.36]Okay, I got half a million.
[41:27.35]Unlock an item with Kudosh.
[41:32.07]Okay.
[41:34.75]Oh, hell yeah.
[41:37.75]Arcade machine.
[41:41.97]What if there's no actual learning?
[41:44.30]I just make a bunch of food places and arcade games.
[41:52.95]Just make a big arcade with no actual learning.
[42:01.30]And just give everybody A's.
[42:05.40]Make a casino college.
[42:09.12]Test your strength.
[42:10.00]Yeah, definitely.
[42:10.88]Alright, where am I going to put this?
[42:15.51]In the bathroom?
[42:16.17]You go take a piss and then you come out.
[42:18.25]I got 200 points.
[42:31.62]Okay.
[42:33.04]What is this?
[42:36.50]You didn't even try.
[42:37.19]Do you stink?
[42:45.83]You are... You are offensively smelly.
[42:53.92]I need... Oh, I need showers.
[42:55.48]Oops.
[42:57.24]You're right.
[42:57.56]You're right.
[42:57.82]I need showers.
[42:59.26]Where do I do that?
[43:08.88]Shower room, okay.
[43:12.08]This should probably... Right here.
[43:19.56]What?
[43:20.78]Oh, I thought you meant... Okay, was it... What the hell?
[43:24.20]Alright, let's have... How many of these should I have in here?
[43:31.41]Should be individual rooms, right?
[43:32.99]Get out and lie down under these.
[43:35.71]Just lay down flat and push all the buttons.
[43:37.19]Okay.
[44:05.13]Door.
[44:08.21]Is that alright?
[44:08.71]Is that is that OK?
[44:12.00]Is this OK?
[44:15.22]Do I have to have the separation separation?
[44:25.78]This is fine, right?
[44:48.65]Why is there no shower curtain?
[44:55.74]Like a Mario collect the star animation and got naked without a curtain or anything.
[45:01.89]Should I... I probably should put doors, right?
[45:09.51]Um... Alright.
[45:11.95]What's wrong with you?
[45:16.10]You have a staff on break with nowhere to relax.
[45:19.73]Where?
[45:20.37]Where are they?
[45:20.85]I have one teacher.
[45:25.83]This one overworked teacher.
[45:27.89]Where are they?
[45:31.70]Where's my staff?
[45:32.76]Is he sleeping in his car?
[45:40.14]Oh, shit.
[45:43.74]No.
[45:44.06]Wait, wait.
[45:44.36]There you are.
[45:47.52]Alright, I need a staff room.
[45:48.38]Alright, I need a staff room.
[45:57.68]Staff room.
[45:58.66]I need another teacher.
[46:02.70]This person wants a dorm?
[46:08.74]What happens when this gets all the way filled?
[46:16.93]Alright.
[46:19.28]Dude, Jeff Vacuum is really carrying this place.
[46:22.58]Okay, I need a staff room.
[46:30.10]Okay, staff room.
[46:31.49]I have no room.
[46:32.09]I need a bigger building.
[46:36.63]Alright, we gotta make this really comfortable.
[46:49.04]There's only one... Okay, there are literally two people that work here.
[46:52.78]I don't need more than one couch.
[46:53.84]Oh, alright.
[46:57.40]I was like, why are they running?
[46:58.16]Okay, let's do a nice lamp.
[47:03.59]And... A TV.
[47:08.69]Oh, a dartboard.
[47:09.55]That's nice.
[47:13.37]Sky painting.
[47:17.08]Purple rug.
[47:21.49]Okay.
[47:24.61]A... A snack table with cookies and shit.
[47:29.43]Yeah.
[47:31.59]I think that's good.
[47:33.97]Here we go.
[47:35.21]Alright, I need some more staff.
[47:43.42]Uh... How about another teacher?
[47:47.07]Okay, Mack Pike.
[47:50.09]Weed infestation?
[47:51.27]Isn't that just college?
[47:53.87]What are you talking about?
[47:54.67]Alright, how about Randy Bird?
[48:06.20]What do you teach?
[48:07.02]Wait, what do you teach?
[48:07.90]Okay, Scientography.
[48:14.17]Where are these weeds?
[48:17.03]Frequently asked questions.
[48:18.90]Well, I don't know where these weeds testing you.
[48:27.20]This one is not a problem.
[48:28.48]Alright, I'll get another another assistant.
[48:32.04]Oh no, another janitor.
[48:35.80]Maintenance yeah, definitely.
[48:40.35]Actually, you know what?
[48:40.89]Take care of the weeds.
[48:46.25]Okay, B+, that's good.
[48:49.73]Student lounge wanted.
[48:51.27]I've tried kicking back in every room on campus, but nothing is quite hitting the spot.
[48:56.23]I think we need a dedicated room for students to hang out, to relax in the lounge in.
[48:59.32]Alright, fine.
[49:08.48]Can't fit there.
[49:17.81]That's good enough.
[49:26.64]Microwave.
[49:29.08]What are you going to microwave?
[49:30.24]The, like, old mac and cheese machine stuff you get out of that?
[49:36.58]Why would the people... Okay, it's microwaved out of here, and then you re-microwave it over here.
[49:46.34]I need more.
[49:47.00]Okay, here we go.
[49:47.66]How about some video games?
[49:49.11]Okay, move this into here.
[49:53.19]That's better.
[49:53.53]I love TP.
[49:54.37]Okay.
[49:54.51]What is that?
[49:55.09]This is a clown trunk.
[49:56.31]Yep.
[50:17.17]And funny costumes.
[50:19.11]Fancy hats.
[50:22.57]That's a pretty good student relax room.
[50:27.70]There's not even a couch.
[50:28.76]I need like a chair.
[50:33.76]There, good enough.
[50:44.54]Alright, we need... Students will send a request.
[50:47.90]Level 3 science lab.
[50:51.55]Here we go.
[50:51.87]Okay, how do I level up the science lab?
[51:03.07]Why is the environment so bad?
[51:06.66]Cheese and firecrackers.
[51:13.22]There are a lot of jobs for janitors around campus.
[51:15.20]I already have two janitors.
[51:20.00]How do I upgrade the room?
[51:30.01]That music's a little loud.
[51:37.95]There you go.
[51:38.30]That's better.
[51:44.21]Maybe make the room bigger and add furniture.
[51:48.66]Oh.
[51:50.20]Where'd you get a hot dog?
[51:56.94]Do I sell hot dogs here?
[51:57.90]You're not going to eat it?
[52:04.14]Wait, you're just going to microwave a hot dog in the bun and then put it in your pocket.
[52:07.95]End of year is approaching.
[52:10.83]It's too late to start trying.
[52:13.84]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[52:14.86]They have a bee.
[52:17.10]Oh, okay.
[52:17.50]Let me add some stuff.
[52:22.93]Okay, we need... Here we go.
[52:25.49]More, like, science equipment.
[52:28.67]A whiteboard.
[52:31.73]And... Dude, a science... Well, that's $8,000.
[52:33.51]No.
[52:33.73]That's good enough.
[52:49.06]Is that enough?
[52:50.62]I need a roof?
[52:51.52]There's already a roof on here.
[52:55.88]Campus management.
[52:58.32]No, we're good.
[52:58.76]Alright, level 3 science lab.
[53:05.34]Room prestige.
[53:06.13]This place still sucks.
[53:07.77]Hold on.
[53:11.63]Oh, I got it.
[53:13.69]End of the year rewards.
[53:17.03]Oh my god, I just punched you in the face.
[53:18.35]I'm sorry.
[53:20.13]So what happened?
[53:23.81]Expelled?
[53:24.59]Alright, my pass rate is 100%.
[53:34.56]Average exam is 81%.
[53:35.46]The end of year results have been released.
[53:41.10]Luck won't help you.
[53:42.22]Oh, okay.
[53:42.66]So now end of year, no one's here so I can do management.
[53:47.34]Okay, let's expand our range of courses by starting a virtual normality course.
[53:51.92]Alright, new course.
[53:54.54]Next year's fees, $180,000 for the year?
[53:56.62]Okay, so this is the virtual reality class.
[53:58.28]Can I do something else too?
[53:59.28]That sounds good.
[54:02.37]Alright, cool.
[54:17.52]Buy a new plot for your second year.
[54:20.16]Yes, it's not quite business as usual here at Duckworth Campus Food Court.
[54:24.13]Oh, shit.
[54:24.47]Where one of the servers has lost a contact lens.
[54:28.25]Unfortunately, they do believe the lens was lost during the preparation of a particularly big lasagna.
[54:34.08]Yeah, I'm buying it.
[54:36.02]Okay.
[54:43.60]I have to redo some of this.
[54:44.48]This looks pretty terrible.
[54:47.14]This looks terrible.
[54:50.28]I should have one be a dormitory, right?
[54:54.59]Dorm, student facilities, food, lunch.
[55:01.21]Yeah, one of them is going to be the actual work building.
[55:06.30]So we're going to change this.
[55:08.32]This is going to be the actual student dormitory, student facility.
[55:14.20]Okay, so let's move this.
[55:14.90]Why are the students still here?
[55:16.56]It's summer break.
[55:17.20]What's the problem?
[55:19.06]Course points?
[55:21.64]What are the course points?
[55:31.78]Alright, get rid of this.
[55:43.41]Can I move this whole building?
[55:44.95]The whole thing?
[55:56.04]Just sell it?
[56:12.09]Move your webcam?
[56:13.67]Oh, sorry.
[56:14.87]Oops.
[56:16.61]Just remake it?
[56:17.33]Yeah, I'll sell it.
[56:18.92]Alright, everybody, you take a shower, but then get out of here.
[56:23.66]Alright, close the room.
[56:25.88]Everybody out.
[56:30.80]Sell this whole thing.
[56:31.40]$14,000.
[56:33.18]You got it.
[56:33.62]Okay, cool.
[56:41.18]Oh, someone was in there.
[56:42.02]Alright, we're good.
[56:47.29]Okay.
[56:48.15]Pause the game.
[56:49.23]Because the people are going to freak out.
[56:52.73]Oh, yeah.
[56:53.11]Actually, probably over here is better.
[56:59.43]Yeah.
[57:07.09]It's better over here.
[57:14.19]Alright, it's paused.
[57:16.33]Alright, so now it's time to expand.
[57:19.87]You can build in a lot of areas in this game.
[57:25.74]Like never before?
[57:26.48]Mirror world?
[57:27.98]Oh, you think I look weird because I flipped it, right?
[57:31.14]Yeah, this is weird.
[57:31.90]This is when you take a picture of yourself with an iPhone and your face looks like you hit it with a hammer like five times.
[57:36.06]Right?
[57:36.32]Because you're seeing yourself flipped.
[57:53.82]It's like, what's wrong with my face?
[57:56.19]Why would my face look like that?
[57:57.79]Yeah.
[58:00.35]Now I know what you mean.
[58:03.39]Watch, I'll show you.
[58:04.03]Ready?
[58:04.79]So check this out.
[58:07.20]This is what I actually look like.
[58:09.58]What?
[58:09.74]There we go, right?
[58:12.86]Isn't that weird?
[58:20.21]This is what my face looks like, for real.
[58:23.94]But if you flip it, it turns you into like a nightmare person.
[58:30.54]See?
[58:48.32]You definitely, you caught me.
[58:55.03]It does look weird, though.
[58:56.26]I agree.
[58:56.58]Okay, two-point campus!
[59:05.88]Which, by the way... In case you didn't know.
[59:10.99]By the same people that made Two-Point Hospital.
[59:13.75]And in case you didn't know.
[59:15.99]It's on every... It's on... It's PlayStation.
[59:18.73]It's on PC.
[59:19.87]It's on Xbox.
[59:21.56]There's a new and improved relationship system.
[59:23.24]Have I told you that one yet?
[59:24.16]Have we talked about that yet?
[59:27.65]You can nurture and grow your students with a deeper and more meaningful sense of connection.
[59:30.73]In case you didn't know.
[59:32.83]Keep the students happy with clubs, societies, gigs.
[59:35.97]Surround them with friends.
[59:36.89]Help them develop relationships and furnish them with care.
[59:39.78]You understand?
[59:44.18]That's in this game.
[59:47.36]Nurture!
[59:48.94]Nurture!
[59:53.77]Fish eye lens.
[59:56.79]Can I do a fish eye lens?
[59:59.27]Hold on.
[60:00.13]Can I do a slight fish eye lens?
[60:07.29]Is that possible in just like OBS?
[60:11.29]Not enough, just enough to look a little weird.
[60:13.39]What's action movie?
[60:15.66]Holy shit, I look so much cooler.
[60:18.96]What?
[60:23.53]Oh, yes, that looks so much better.
[60:29.12]Wow.
[60:29.62]Actually, I'm keeping this filter on.
[60:30.84]I'm not even kidding around.
[60:35.64]These look so much better than just being a regular.
[60:38.36]No, I'm putting this one.
[60:39.42]Look at how good this looks.
[60:42.01]This actually looks better.
[60:43.25]That's ridiculous.
[60:48.63]OK, well, that's cool.
[60:49.75]I'm going to keep this on.
[60:55.78]I thought I just, I thought I just closed my fucking OBS and ended the stream.
[60:59.51]Alright, I gotta, hey, I gotta play, I gotta play, I gotta play.
[61:07.94]I go to the school and some psycho keeps stealing the shower.
[61:13.04]That's very weird considering that you're supposed to be paused and frozen.
[61:17.88]So you're not actually here.
[61:19.45]Because if you were, you wouldn't be talking right now, would you?
[61:22.65]Okay.
[61:22.97]Don't just drag it like an idiot.
[61:25.23]Where do I want all the beds?
[61:27.85]Right here, right?
[61:28.33]Okay.
[61:44.69]I'm thinking just like right here, and then we'll do bathrooms, shower, and then student facilities.
[61:51.48]So this is going to be dorm rooms, beds and shit.
[61:55.90]That doesn't need to be huge.
[61:59.88]It doesn't need to be gigantic.
[62:03.02]We want good beds.
[62:06.68]So let's go like one.
[62:10.71]Up to five people can have a bed together.
[62:13.37]It's weird to say that out loud.
[62:14.61]I know.
[62:14.79]I'm sorry.
[62:15.11]Okay.
[62:24.64]It's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
[62:25.24]30.
[62:25.26]I can add him later if I need to.
[62:36.81]There's that.
[62:39.03]We should have a couple of wardrobes.
[62:42.29]So people aren't fighting over it.
[62:44.39]Add some desks.
[62:51.21]Okay.
[62:54.05]Okay.
[62:56.67]What is this?
[62:58.46]Oh, a dorm notice board.
[63:00.34]Where should this go?
[63:03.68]How about like right here?
[63:06.40]See, people like that.
[63:09.24]Trash can.
[63:13.36]Trash cans.
[63:17.30]What is this?
[63:24.86]What?
[63:30.40]Oh.
[63:32.92]I thought I had 469,000 kudosh coins.
[63:35.18]I was going to say this is not tuned correctly.
[63:39.98]I was like, this is really inexpensive.
[63:42.60]You can definitely buy everything.
[63:43.94]That's why I was just buying everything.
[63:46.20]I thought I had 500 grand in this currency.
[63:49.69]So I bought some of this dumb shit.
[63:52.25]How much was the clown trunk?
[63:57.41]This feels like my channel point rewards.
[63:59.21]That's what I was thinking.
[64:02.78]It's like, ah, they're very low.
[64:04.56]It's like 200 channel points to do anything here.
[64:15.11]Um, this is the relationship bed.
[64:17.67]I bought this painting.
[64:20.69]Well, I have to use it then.
[64:21.97]Everybody gets one.
[64:22.54]Okay, I'm turning the clowns on top.
[64:35.03]Everybody gets one of these.
[64:39.38]And I got the rug too.
[64:40.32]So we're going to put a rug down under a couple of the beds.
[64:50.63]Okay.
[64:52.83]Sanitizer.
[64:54.96]Plant.
[65:07.03]Yeah, I'm gonna delete all channel points.
[65:08.43]All channel points are getting deleted.
[65:12.97]And we're gonna bring it back even stronger.
[65:15.53]You know what I mean?
[65:17.75]Okay, so that's fine.
[65:18.47]This is a nice little dorm area.
[65:20.05]This bed needs to be actually on the wall.
[65:25.93]Everything looks good, right?
[65:27.01]Okay.
[65:28.01]So that's good.
[65:29.65]What am I missing?
[65:34.31]What's wrong?
[65:34.79]Oh, there's no door.
[65:39.24]There's dormitory two, apparently.
[65:41.32]Alright.
[65:44.92]So now I'm going to make a bathroom right here.
[65:50.30]Bathroom and shower room will be right here and here.
[65:52.74]And then the hangout room will be here.
[65:56.52]And there you go.
[66:01.92]What are you guys doing?
[66:03.63]Channel points.
[66:04.27]I got to turn off channel points.
[66:05.57]Delete.
[66:06.17]Make channel points not redeemable.
[66:25.24]Okay.
[66:30.43]Sink.
[66:32.73]A hand dryer.
[66:35.17]And a trash, just in case.
[66:38.81]Okay.
[66:41.33]Wait, one more sink on the other side.
[66:42.63]Yeah, right here.
[66:44.82]Now I need a door.
[66:45.60]Door?
[66:48.07]I actually want the door to be here.
[66:49.05]Ah, I screwed it up on them.
[66:56.92]That's better.
[67:00.54]Okay.
[67:01.24]Shower's gonna go here.
[67:02.94]I'm smart.
[67:04.14]I have to turn off channel points right now.
[67:05.62]It's out of control.
[67:08.72]How do I turn channel points off?
[67:10.10]I need to turn it off right now.
[67:11.02]How do I turn it off?
[67:12.18]How do you turn off channel points?
[67:22.90]How do you turn off?
[67:23.42]I have to turn them off now.
[67:25.62]Yeah, no, no, no.
[67:26.18]Fine.
[67:26.66]I'm not going to turn it off.
[67:28.94]Would you shut up?
[67:30.96]We'll put it in emote only mode and you shut your shut up.
[67:35.67]I'm very angry right now.
[67:36.97]This is a sponsor stream and you're making us look bad.
[67:48.43]How am I supposed to show up to the board meeting?
[67:52.12]Huh?
[67:54.72]I'm supposed to show up to the next board meeting and explain to everybody at that part of the organization what's going on here.
[68:03.64]By the way, the board is me and Otto.
[68:09.36]And by the way, he's the accountant.
[68:12.06]I don't handle that.
[68:17.72]Don't delete the room.
[68:18.38]The room's done.
[68:22.77]Yeah, keep it in emote only.
[68:25.43]They're abusing the channel points, and I don't like it.
[68:27.95]It's making me very, very upset.
[68:35.23]Don't you just imagine Otto with a pair of glasses on and a suit?
[68:41.15]He's at a boardroom table with a pencil and a paper.
[68:46.67]And he just doesn't know what he's doing, and it's just so cute.
[68:50.85]Okay, showers.
[69:03.85]Okay.
[69:05.91]Maybe one sink.
[69:08.79]One more towel rack.
[69:10.75]That's better.
[69:11.27]Okay, good.
[69:11.99]Complete it.
[69:13.48]There we go.
[69:14.70]Much cleaner.
[69:18.04]Much cleaner.
[69:21.48]And then there's enough room in the hallway, right?
[69:22.92]Okay.
[69:23.22]Because then this will be an activity kind of area for the students, right?
[69:30.01]Campus building.
[69:33.15]Student lounge.
[69:33.79]Yep.
[69:34.11]Okay.
[69:34.57]Student lounge.
[69:39.03]Shit.
[69:43.83]No, it's okay.
[69:44.31]It's alright.
[69:48.65]There's enough room.
[69:51.93]There's enough room.
[69:52.37]Yeah, we're fine.
[69:54.77]Alright.
[69:54.97]That's good.
[69:55.33]Maybe two couches.
[70:05.08]A little game table.
[70:10.59]Microwavable snacks.
[70:13.05]Like a sink to wash your hands.
[70:16.84]Arcade machines.
[70:32.12]This is Harrison Wolf.
[70:33.90]And thanks for stopping by.
[70:36.14]Today, we're going to be talking about a subject that's near and dear to my TVs.
[70:41.46]The one thing you need when things are getting hairy.
[70:45.69]TV funny outside.
[70:47.81]Or you just hiding from the milkman.
[70:50.71]That's right.
[70:51.83]Today, we're talking panic rooms.
[70:57.71]That was good.
[71:01.38]Alright, on the count of three, I want you to let them out of emote only.
[71:03.90]On the count of three.
[71:07.77]Let them out of emote only on the count of three.
[71:10.69]And I'm going to sit here silently.
[71:11.97]And if I'm not happy, it's going back.
[71:14.69]One, two, three, go.
[71:22.87]I'm happy.
[71:28.36]Alright.
[71:31.15]uh is that too much what the one clown trunk costume area yeah alright this is this is fun maybe another chair in the middle or something dartboard over here too yeah dartboard um maybe another like somebody's to watch people like just sit here
[71:57.41]I don't know, in case you want to have like a little hangout couch area.
[72:02.33]And, yeah, like a place to lounge and have a snack together.
[72:05.55]Yeah, that's fine.
[72:07.02]Alright, we're done.
[72:07.76]This one's perfect.
[72:08.52]Alright, so this is the student hangout zone.
[72:13.58]Okay.
[72:17.02]Student hangout zone looks good.
[72:20.22]Now let me remove it from over here.
[72:25.42]They're all here.
[72:26.72]Well, they'll figure it out.
[72:34.75]I should probably keep the bathroom.
[72:35.85]So you don't have to go all the way back to the student lounge to go to the bathroom.
[72:41.49]What?
[72:41.83]That's fine?
[72:43.70]Okay.
[72:44.86]This has got to move too.
[72:45.88]This is annoying in the way.
[72:51.08]Can I pick it up?
[72:55.66]I'll just make a new one.
[72:59.83]I'll make a new one of these too.
[73:01.83]Wait.
[73:04.75]If I delete this, I'll lose the prestige.
[73:07.81]Right?
[73:11.95]That's actually a bad idea.
[73:14.03]That's a really bad idea, isn't it?
[73:23.36]Yeah.
[73:26.74]One person just goes... Yeah.
[73:30.20]Y-E.
[73:31.86]In a sea of people getting just banned and timed out.
[73:35.76]Yeah.
[73:40.30]Yeah.
[73:45.09]Thanks for the help.
[73:46.47]I appreciate it, man.
[73:48.43]Alright, so... I'm gonna just expand it.
[73:52.31]It can stay here.
[73:52.83]Yeah.
[73:54.73]Yeah.
[73:58.65]Ooh.
[73:59.09]Okay, wait.
[74:03.32]I need to edit the room.
[74:06.68]Pick up room.
[74:08.05]Edit room.
[74:08.49]Alright, here we go.
[74:09.15]Let's add some wall.
[74:15.22]Like that.
[74:17.10]Okay.
[74:17.32]Let's move.
[74:18.32]This can stay over here.
[74:19.70]I need the other science equipment, right?
[74:22.48]Wait, edit it again.
[74:22.98]What is this guy talking about?
[74:24.12]Okay.
[74:44.28]Okay, now I need another piece of equipment in here.
[74:46.72]Something better.
[74:47.14]I need some science equipment.
[75:06.56]What the fuck is that?
[75:10.12]How do I find it?
[75:17.13]Where's the science room stuff?
[75:21.03]Oh, here we go.
[75:21.43]Okay.
[75:23.31]I don't have enough to do that, but I can make the room better, right?
[75:25.99]So I got a couple of those.
[75:27.27]It's almost a level of prestige up.
[75:28.77]So let's do two of these.
[75:29.43]There we go.
[75:31.67]Science lab level three.
[75:33.86]Yes!
[75:36.54]Couple more whiteboards.
[75:41.06]A place to sit down, right?
[75:42.44]Is there any desks or anything?
[75:52.69]Oh, why would I not?
[75:54.57]I spent it on a piñata or whatever the hell it was.
[75:58.03]What did I even spend that money on?
[75:59.07]Okay, that's fine.
[76:09.78]What's wrong with your camera?
[76:12.81]It's bent.
[76:13.23]It's bent.
[76:24.79]Is that a window, or did I just take the wall away?
[76:29.35]How are those windows?
[76:31.55]Oh, people really like that.
[76:37.99]This is level 5 now.
[76:42.57]Okay.
[76:43.73]Alright, so this place is better.
[76:45.05]I need, like, chairs or something.
[76:46.64]Okay.
[76:52.94]I need chairs.
[76:56.72]There we go.
[76:57.60]That's five, um... What are they called?
[77:00.34]Isn't it Sumer, not Sumer?
[77:07.41]It is?
[77:12.27]Wait a minute, is it Sumer?
[77:15.51]What did I say?
[77:17.34]Sumer Kamlade.
[77:18.82]Yeah.
[77:20.78]Yeah.
[77:24.37]Alright, that's good enough.
[77:25.47]I got it leveled up, so that'll be giving people better grades now.
[77:27.97]When it comes to surveillance, I'm strictly an anti-camera kind of guy.
[77:33.21]I need a lecture hall.
[77:33.97]My philosophy is I can't see you.
[77:37.01]You can't see me.
[77:37.69]Lecture hall will go right in the middle.
[77:39.25]I like to keep things as low tech as possible.
[77:42.89]I'd recommend strategically placed strings attached to some bells.
[77:48.01]You hear a ring and you got yourself a visitor.
[77:51.39]Of course, sometimes it's the doorbell and you're right.
[77:54.61]What else can I put in here?
[77:55.87]Is it a camera?
[77:56.59]You want to get real crafty?
[77:59.03]Just leave a load of rakes in your yard.
[78:01.37]This guy, these guys are freaking me out.
[78:04.72]You'll hear the sucker when he steps on one and takes a handle to the chops.
[78:10.46]Ouch.
[78:13.26]OK, people like that whiteboard behind you over here.
[78:19.81]Just in case you need to show a lot of work.
[78:22.93]Trash cans.
[78:28.38]And sanitizations.
[78:29.88]Okay.
[78:32.80]And plants.
[78:35.56]Looks good.
[78:36.86]Do I have two of these?
[78:37.50]No.
[78:38.72]Should I?
[78:38.98]Shit.
[78:49.00]Uh, does that matter?
[78:49.78]I don't think that... I don't think this matters.
[78:54.20]It gave me points.
[79:03.17]What's that?
[79:03.45]What pole?
[79:07.61]That's fine.
[79:07.99]It gave me points.
[79:08.47]I don't care.
[79:10.90]Alright, that's Electra Hall.
[79:13.29]Now we have to build the other room, which is the VR lab.
[79:19.70]35 grand, alright.
[79:20.24]Hopefully this is worth it.
[79:22.12]I'm thinking over here, right?
[79:26.58]Like, yeah, over here?
[79:31.54]Alright, this is the VR lab.
[79:33.36]Should I make it bigger?
[79:40.38]Bigger?
[79:40.64]Should I fill this whole thing?
[79:47.37]Yeah.
[79:50.15]Yeah.
[79:51.33]Yeah.
[79:51.93]Okay.
[79:58.82]Yeah.
[80:10.73]Is that too big on this side, though?
[80:12.59]Maybe.
[80:13.81]Whatever.
[80:14.17]I don't care.
[80:14.51]It's fine.
[80:15.35]I hate the way it looks.
[80:17.79]I hate the way it looks I hate the way this looks Why do I hate this so much?
[80:50.95]Should I just fill the space and just say, fuck it, who cares?
[80:54.86]I'm just gonna, whatever, fill it.
[80:56.42]It doesn't matter.
[80:56.82]Alright, should I have more than one of these?
[81:02.50]Okay, so that, this is a, like, VR area here.
[81:09.61]I should probably have more than a few of these.
[81:12.83]This is a VR chair.
[81:16.37]These are really expensive.
[81:21.23]I could really do with a sense of purpose.
[81:25.19]Foundation.
[81:27.29]Who needs purpose when you've got VR?
[81:29.73]Okay, I'm going to do five of those and then the VR desk.
[81:34.47]Wait, do they need to be in front of them?
[81:40.48]I'll just do this.
[81:44.50]And then VR headsets.
[81:48.86]Where do these go?
[81:55.57]Against the wall here.
[81:56.23]OK.
[82:04.90]Hand sanitizer.
[82:05.54]Is that OK?
[82:08.68]Do I have two?
[82:09.62]I'm going to do two.
[82:18.61]And then windows.
[82:34.72]Okay.
[82:35.88]Trash can.
[82:41.03]Okay.
[82:43.75]Windows in a VR room.
[82:45.79]Why, what?
[82:47.89]What platform is the best to buy two-point campus on?
[82:50.59]I'm really glad you brought that up, mods.
[82:52.29]Let me tell you.
[82:53.28]You got quite a few options here.
[82:55.26]You've got PlayStation.
[82:56.54]You've got Xbox.
[82:57.76]You've got PC.
[82:59.18]You've even got the, um...
[83:14.08]You've got it on the Nintendo Switch.
[83:15.86]So you've got a lot of options.
[83:18.77]Pretty much every major platform this is available on.
[83:22.07]It's got really cool new abilities.
[83:24.81]You can, you know, build in the out... For the first time, you can build in the great outdoors.
[83:28.49]You can build outside, which is the... You couldn't do that before.
[83:31.77]If I were to take a pick right now, I would say it's... You know, I'm going to give you a little wild card here.
[83:37.12]I'm going to say this is probably great on the Switch because you can bring it into the bathroom.
[83:41.42]This is a perfect go-to-the-bathroom game, I think, if I'm going to be really honest with you.
[83:46.69]I can see myself playing this in the bathroom.
[83:49.11]The switch lets you do that.
[83:54.47]What is he looking out the window for?
[83:56.42]Alright, that looks good.
[83:59.24]Maybe some... Maybe this is too big.
[84:07.72]Here's a question from Gyro in Duckworth.
[84:11.54]What is some of your favorite panic room pastimes?
[84:14.66]This guy with the panic rooms.
[84:17.16]What is this guy?
[84:18.50]I find that you can have a lot of fun with a little bouncing ball.
[84:21.70]This guy has one piece of content.
[84:23.40]In fact, one time I was bouncing, lost track of time, and it turned out that I've been doing it for 16 hours.
[84:31.57]I went cold turkey after that.
[84:33.09]So we got the library still.
[84:35.81]Should I put the library in the student hall?
[84:38.75]That might make more sense over here.
[84:40.85]Turkey.
[84:44.34]What do you think?
[84:45.24]Library in the academic building or library in the student area?
[84:51.97]Yeah.
[84:54.43]Yeah.
[84:55.53]No.
[84:57.27]Yeah.
[84:57.43]I don't know what just happened, but it's gone.
[85:05.86]Okay, thank goodness.
[85:15.27]Stop.
[85:21.07]I'm going to put the library here where the students are.
[85:29.88]Wait.
[85:30.34]Oh, no, this is the staff room.
[85:31.50]I don't want this over here.
[85:44.24]Okay, keep it there.
[85:45.06]This is the library.
[85:48.72]I need two lecture theaters?
[85:53.06]Oh, that's not good.
[85:53.76]Okay, I need another one of these.
[86:10.37]I need another receptionist here.
[86:20.23]This room is way too freaking small.
[86:45.61]Sell it.
[86:50.66]Computer desk.
[86:52.82]Yep.
[86:53.14]We need computers.
[86:54.30]Maybe two of these.
[86:59.83]Make a meth lab.
[87:02.01]That's not happening.
[87:04.75]Alright.
[87:04.95]Some more books.
[87:06.55]Okay.
[87:07.89]This is now a true... This is a library now.
[87:19.30]Everyone has the same painting.
[87:20.56]Alright, so that's much better.
[87:23.32]I do need two people working here now, though.
[87:27.01]Yeah, okay, I need two people working there.
[87:28.81]That's good.
[87:31.15]That me... Whoa, I just froze.
[87:35.05]My brain just turned off.
[87:40.34]The lecture hall, they both have to be back-to-back over here.
[87:46.53]Here's one for the more advanced panickers amongst you.
[87:50.23]It's important to be one step ahead.
[87:53.35]What do I mean by that?
[87:54.89]Well, you could do a number of things.
[87:57.71]You could have a trap door for sneaky getaway.
[88:01.48]You could install your panic room in a hall of mirrors.
[88:05.42]Or you could hang a sign on the door that says out for lunch.
[88:11.40]This place is way too big.
[88:13.33]It's massive.
[88:14.27]It doesn't need to be this big at all.
[88:18.57]Let's close it up a little.
[88:34.57]Sell.
[88:36.83]Sell it.
[88:39.03]Sell it!
[88:41.68]Sell it!
[88:45.42]Sell it!
[88:51.52]Sell it.
[88:51.80]Sell it.
[88:54.42]Sell it.
[88:54.74]Sell it.
[88:56.90]Sell it.
[88:57.10]Sell it.
[89:03.34]Sell it.
[89:03.64]Sell it.
[89:11.78]Sell it.
[89:12.00]Sell it.
[89:15.77]Sell it.
[89:16.07]Sell it.
[89:16.69]How do I do it?
[89:22.13]How do I sell this?
[89:28.13]Is your camera on 120 FOV?
[89:29.93]I don't think so.
[89:32.15]How do I sell it?
[89:34.38]Subtract, right?
[89:35.08]Yes.
[89:36.80]How do I do it?
[89:42.66]Which pizza is the best?
[89:43.92]What's going on?
[89:44.44]This is so wrong.
[89:48.70]Meat pizza sucks.
[89:52.48]If you say that meat, like meat pizza, I'm imagining meat time is meat lovers pizza.
[89:59.87]Wait, it costs money to vote on this poll.
[90:01.69]I was, wait, what?
[90:05.31]No, I'm not wrong.
[90:05.97]I'm not wrong.
[90:06.43]Let me tell you something.
[90:07.59]Listen to me.
[90:09.27]Pepperoni is amazing on pizza.
[90:11.07]Sausage is amazing on pizza.
[90:12.76]Hamburger is amazing on pizza.
[90:16.06]Uh... Turkey or whatever.
[90:18.17]I don't know.
[90:18.45]Whatever else you... Whatever weird shit.
[90:19.71]Chicken is amazing on pizza.
[90:22.09]But when you put them all on it at the same time, it ruins everything.
[90:25.93]It just becomes a fucking lasagna.
[90:29.76]You can't... You pick it up.
[90:31.20]You try to pick a piece of meat lover's pizza up.
[90:32.92]It falls apart.
[90:34.36]It goes everywhere.
[90:36.80]It's not even a piece of pizza anymore.
[90:37.98]It's just annoying.
[90:40.68]I'm of the opinion, and you guys can tell me if I'm wrong here, but that's fine.
[90:43.44]It doesn't bother me.
[90:44.82]I don't think there should ever be more than two toppings on a pizza, ever.
[90:48.39]Ever, for any reason.
[90:50.42]When you put more than two toppings on a pizza, it weighs down to a point where it cannot be eaten anymore the way that pizza is.
[90:56.89]At that point, it's not a pizza.
[90:57.85]It's a casserole.
[90:58.21]Three, maybe.
[90:58.49]Depends on what it is.
[91:00.05]If you... This fucking panic room guy.
[91:01.83]I need to quiet him while I'm talking for a sec.
[91:04.06]Where is...
[91:18.89]I feel like this is TTS donations and you guys are on this panic room meme.
[91:23.62]Okay.
[91:25.42]So anyways.
[91:27.96]What the hell is just coming out of my mouth?
[91:33.10]What were we talking about?
[91:34.03]No, we're not talking about panic rooms.
[91:37.13]We're talking about pizza.
[91:40.23]We're talking about pizza.
[91:43.31]Okay, that guy's wicked funny, but not at the exact moment I'm talking about pizza.
[91:49.70]Pepperoni?
[91:51.32]Like, okay, if you have, like, mushrooms, onions, and peppers, that's three items.
[91:56.54]That's fine.
[91:57.76]Pepperoni, like, garlic and onion, that's fine.
[92:01.12]Anything more than two or three, and you just, come on.
[92:04.33]Just, you might as well just make a lasagna.
[92:06.73]Seriously.
[92:14.17]Small items are fine.
[92:15.75]But more than three or four, it starts to become too much for me.
[92:21.64]Garlic on pizza?
[92:22.34]Have you never had garlic and onion pizza?
[92:28.16]Wait, you've never had garlic and onion pizza?
[92:29.50]What are you talking about?
[92:30.10]That's kind of crazy.
[92:32.22]It's amazing.
[92:35.06]You're going to eat garlic.
[92:38.30]I don't even listen to that.
[92:43.17]OK, so let me try this again.
[92:45.19]Alright, subtract.
[92:52.95]How do I actually subtract it though?
[92:58.52]Do I need to have this in here?
[93:09.08]Invalid wall.
[93:13.65]Oh, okay, you have to actually complete the room.
[93:15.31]I get it.
[93:15.69]Oh yeah, it did not need to be that big.
[93:23.16]So that's fine.
[93:23.74]Okay, so now I need a second one of these.
[93:25.38]Uh, sorry students, you're gonna have to move.
[93:31.95]Immediately.
[93:32.43]I was gonna say, what the hell have I done?
[93:37.37]That's fine.
[93:38.23]Okay.
[93:38.39]Okay.
[93:46.57]Not a great idea.
[93:47.39]OK.
[93:56.62]I'm going to extend the bathroom a little bit.
[94:10.34]OK, that's fine.
[94:14.40]Now I've got I need a second lecture hall, which is going to have to go down here.
[94:19.36]Or maybe you could go here.
[94:21.78]Yeah, I could go here with the door.
[94:25.46]No.
[94:25.98]OK, that's fine, and I'm going to take this edge here and the other lecture hall will go right here.
[94:36.90]That's perfect.
[94:44.61]Much better.
[94:45.03]Let's even this out.
[94:50.49]There's some shit in the way.
[94:51.83]Get this stupid hand sanitizer out of here.
[94:53.54]What are you doing?
[95:10.16]Alright, that's good.
[95:11.10]I need a second one here.
[95:26.07]Oh, it's because this door.
[95:27.83]That's fine.
[95:41.29]That's good.
[95:43.31]OK, cool.
[95:45.55]This is fun.
[95:46.96]OK, I'm going to get a ton of they're going to get good grades.
[95:52.18]Alright, here's another lecture theater.
[95:53.30]This is lecture theater two.
[95:58.28]There it is.
[95:59.08]Done.
[96:00.26]There we go.
[96:00.90]Alright.
[96:02.96]Yeah!
[96:05.70]I think I'm ready to start the year.
[96:11.49]Unmirror the thing.
[96:12.51]You look like an uncanny troll face.
[96:14.49]You have to get over it.
[96:19.77]Okay, let's do... Let's hire some extra staff.
[96:23.38]So, we need a VR, um... What's the difference between you two?
[96:29.60]Okay, moves faster than normal.
[96:31.04]Excellent personal hygiene.
[96:33.54]Gets hungry easily.
[96:34.48]Gets thirsty easily.
[96:36.89]You're fine.
[96:39.45]So, we need a VR, uh, technician.
[96:44.51]We need... Should I get another science teacher?
[96:48.41]Do we only have... We already have one.
[96:51.07]Aerodynamics?
[96:56.60]I definitely need another, okay, I need a library assistant.
[96:59.83]You're, yeah, okay, you're good.
[97:01.31]Okay, so that's two and then maybe one more janitor.
[97:06.29]I don't want to lose all, I don't want to blow my money.
[97:09.83]Your head looks like a slice of pizza.
[97:10.99]Alright, now what, I need to make this look a little nicer.
[97:27.39]This is so barren out here.
[97:32.39]What are the needs?
[97:34.91]Table, football, wanted.
[97:36.27]I need 100 coins.
[97:38.84]Tree bench.
[97:39.82]I need 100 coins.
[97:40.38]I can't do it right now.
[97:41.74]I'm sorry.
[97:43.98]Table, football, tree bench.
[97:45.58]I don't have it.
[97:46.40]Alright.
[97:52.21]Well, I got to put like some cool decorations.
[97:56.35]How about this one?
[98:02.26]And then, what's this?
[98:06.34]Oh, a fountain.
[98:18.09]Cool.
[98:24.02]I don't want to overdo it.
[98:31.57]Seating, like, right outside.
[98:32.45]This is, like, a good place to have it.
[98:38.63]That looks good.
[98:39.83]That looks great.
[98:44.13]This is shitload of items.
[98:45.03]There's actually a lot.
[98:47.40]Okay.
[98:49.58]What's this?
[98:50.84]Paths and terrain.
[98:52.76]Oh, okay.
[98:53.96]Alright.
[98:55.48]Manage courses.
[98:59.88]I think we're ready.
[99:02.89]Ready to go?
[99:03.31]Should I have some seating in here?
[99:07.41]Okay, I can't even put... Wait, what about a sofa?
[99:13.41]Couch.
[99:16.51]Let's go.
[99:16.83]It's time to start the academic year.
[99:22.43]What am I doing wrong here?
[99:35.29]Here we go.
[99:37.55]Are you sure you want to start the year with the following courses?
[99:41.33]Yes.
[99:48.25]Oh, what is that?
[99:48.77]OK, it's literally alright.
[99:50.21]That what the fuck is that and why is it floating around the light?
[99:57.39]I just got scared by like a hair.
[100:02.86]There was this big dust bunny that was floating around and it got attracted to the ring light.
[100:08.07]At least I think that's what that was.
[100:24.92]Can you see this?
[100:37.78]That floated up into the light and casted a shadow.
[100:42.62]And it was horrifying.
[100:44.20]I thought I was getting attacked by an insect.
[100:51.12]It's just dust.
[100:51.86]Yeah, I know, but it floated by the ring light and casted this massive shadow.
[100:58.50]You made a Lord Voldemort sound?
[101:00.56]Did I really?
[101:01.24]Alright, New Year.
[101:05.52]Let's do it.
[101:11.58]Welcome students.
[101:13.85]We've got more classes here.
[101:15.23]We've got a nice place to hang out.
[101:19.53]We've also got... That's cheating.
[101:23.05]What's wrong with the toilet?
[101:25.16]Alright.
[101:40.35]Oh!
[101:41.05]We have a relationship forming between... Wolfrick Halfmoon... and... Randy Fenderson.
[101:59.36]I think I can only have 20 students.
[102:01.26]Alright, come check out the dorm room, man.
[102:07.79]It's pretty sick.
[102:10.02]Yeah, I remember Benny Bungle from year one.
[102:15.20]Yeah, try on the hats, man.
[102:17.88]Check out the clown trunk, too, when you have a chance.
[102:23.57]There are way too many students.
[102:24.95]We only have two classes.
[102:29.31]Two students have a personal goal of wanting to sit on a park bench.
[102:32.85]I mean...
[102:40.00]Really?
[102:46.94]That's a goal of yours is to sit on a park bench.
[102:51.63]I mean, I'm not going to deny you that.
[102:52.71]That's fine.
[102:53.19]Here, go fulfill your greatest desire.
[102:55.43]Where are the teachers?
[103:12.96]What's wrong?
[103:14.65]Learning rate 118%.
[103:16.19]Textbook cubicle required.
[103:19.69]Get to class.
[103:20.31]Hurry up.
[103:22.81]Wait.
[103:23.29]The teacher.
[103:25.43]The students are in here unsupervised.
[103:31.57]How many teachers do I have?
[103:35.21]The VR students are making porn.
[103:37.22]You have to stop them.
[103:53.29]students are asked not to ask questions oh you got an you got an intelligence boost they're definitely going to end up with a c right uh oh there's only 10 room capacity one two three four five six seven eight nine ten yo how do I add more people

[104:34.34]Did you see it?
[104:36.90]You saw that, right?
[104:39.08]Make the room bigger.
[104:39.78]Nobody's going to the library.
[104:48.18]They're all just goofing off in the hangout room.
[104:58.71]could hear a pin drop university gives you a bright future look at this look at this come on no one wants to study oh my goodness hot dog kiosk this might be frightfully exciting for you the people of freshly now have a second thing to be proud of

[105:54.96]Alright, no more like just potato chips and sodas.
[106:00.18]Students are reminded to find themselves.
[106:08.75]Could this be outside?
[106:09.69]Maybe this shouldn't be inside here.
[106:18.63]That would actually be amazing though.
[106:22.78]Do you know... Okay, somebody confirm this to me.
[106:25.48]I've heard just randomly through just various people and stuff.
[106:31.04]Has any of you guys ever heard of this?
[106:32.14]Of like a restaurant being in your school?
[106:35.30]Like a McDonald's or a... Like a fast food place being like in the school.
[106:40.25]Or like a Starbucks or something.
[106:45.71]Yes, that happens.
[106:46.47]A subway.
[106:47.03]We had a subway.
[106:50.49]We had a subway.
[106:51.05]It might...
[106:56.25]If there was like a McDonald's in between the science room and the math room, I would have been there all the time.
[107:02.24]There's a Dunkin Donuts here.
[107:04.44]Really?
[107:04.78]That sounds amazing.
[107:10.40]We had a deli, but not a brand name restaurant.
[107:12.12]We had a Taco Bell, Wendy's, Arby's, Dunkin, and a Panera.
[107:14.87]That sounds incredible.
[107:18.39]So you tell me you could like go out of your like logic class and they would just be a Starbucks in the fucking building right there.
[107:36.87]In college university.
[107:37.63]Yeah.
[107:39.15]That sounds amazing.
[107:40.55]It's a separate building.
[107:42.05]How far though?
[107:48.09]Corporate takeover.
[107:52.71]Bro, just walk to the fast food.
[107:55.20]But how convenient is that?
[107:56.36]If I can walk out of the lecture hall and there's just a Burger King here.
[108:03.94]Alright!
[108:04.76]I'm getting a number two.
[108:05.81]Let's go.
[108:06.45]I'm ready.
[108:07.73]That'd be so awesome.
[108:11.33]I would've become such a fat fuck.
[108:13.55]I really would've been.
[108:16.43]We had a Papa John's in the cafeteria.
[108:19.65]That's so unfair.
[108:20.61]That's unfair.
[108:25.38]Mall food court?
[108:27.28]Yeah, that would be amazing.
[108:28.98]If there was like three or four different restaurants in the campus hall?
[108:33.44]What happened to you?
[108:37.71]You just did something cool.
[108:38.41]What'd you do?
[108:38.73]Good grades?
[108:45.59]Oh, friends with Charlie Leotard.
[108:51.05]Alright, they're friends.
[108:57.15]Oh no, maybe it was a bad idea to have the fucking hot dog kiosk.
[109:02.38]Nobody's doing well.
[109:05.52]He's holding his ass.
[109:07.10]Oh, no, no, no.
[109:07.96]He's walking like this.
[109:10.91]I thought he was going like this, like holding his ass.
[109:13.75]Like they all have stomach aches and they're gonna like shit their pants.
[109:20.41]Now everybody wants to go into the library.
[109:23.21]Oh, wait a minute.
[109:23.75]Wait, I have to.
[109:25.39]Um.
[109:27.31]Oh, no.
[109:31.09]What do I do?
[109:32.14]What do I do?
[109:32.56]There's too many people.
[109:36.08]Hey, you're either gonna study or you're gonna get up.
[109:38.56]Don't sleep.
[109:39.94]Sleep in your bed.
[109:41.86]No, don't sleep.
[109:42.88]Get up.
[109:43.48]You've been expelled!
[110:14.80]What a dictator.
[110:15.84]No, dude.
[110:16.36]I'm just saying.
[110:17.33]There's not enough room.

[139:38.90]People are gonna have to fucking bowling ball ingredients to each other.
[139:42.44]Visitors should be checked in and then removed immediately.
[140:22.58]Maybe it's already placed.
[140:23.36]I want a second one.
[140:35.62]Is that alright?

[141:00.06]Frequently asked questions.
[141:02.20]No, I've not seen your frog.
[141:10.06]Why is this room so weird?
[141:11.32]Oh, it doesn't go all the way down.
[141:13.84]How did I mess that up?
[141:18.76]How did I screw that up?
[141:21.56]The easiest thing to do.
[141:22.76]We're back.
[141:23.76]Today's election sees incumbent mayor Tabitha Winsock take on all challenges.

[141:32.36]Yes, the cousin of Jumbo's CEO, Jumbo McNally.
[141:36.48]Ms.
[141:36.72]Winsock has held a steady, some say tedious, lead in the polls over Mr. McNally.
[141:42.38]But what effect, if any, will his last gas speech have on today's proceedings?
[141:48.10]If you missed it, Mr. McNally

[147:36.59]Okay.

[148:46.21]It has to go here.
[148:46.92]I got no more room to do anything else.
[148:48.68]I got no more room for anything.
[148:49.78]There's no room for anything else.
[148:54.73]Oh, I wonder if this image is fake.
[148:56.01]I don't get it.
[149:04.24]What's this mean?
[149:11.70]Your head looks like the in and out sign.
[149:30.68]I don't get it.
[149:31.26]I don't understand.
[149:39.01]That's reaching very far.
[149:40.95]Why?
[149:45.85]Because my face is tilted?
[149:47.85]Unattended sandwiches will be eaten by me.
[150:00.95]Okay.
[150:05.32]Sure.
[150:06.52]Whatever you say.
[150:10.70]In and out sign head.
[150:42.42]I'm trying to fix it.
[150:45.10]I gotta look, I'm not, I gotta look directly in the camera.
[150:46.82]This is the problem.
[150:47.56]Hold on.
[150:52.31]Education is not refundable.
[150:59.11]Why do I look like that?
[151:05.03]What?
[151:05.25]Yeah, I'm like this.
[151:07.21]Why am I that way?
[151:08.67]I'm so confused.
[151:18.70]But hold on, but does it fit?
[151:19.94]But actually, I'm serious.
[151:20.90]Does it fix it if I do this?
[151:29.72]What's happening?
[151:30.74]What's happening to my face?
[151:33.34]What's happening to my face?
[151:34.86]What's happening?
[151:35.40]I just switched back to normal.
[151:36.40]What's happening to my face?
[151:38.36]I'm serious.
[151:38.82]What happened to my face?
[151:43.60]You saw that, right?
[151:44.44]That was fucking weird.
[151:46.09]You saw that.
[151:47.57]Why is Zaya like up here?
[151:49.07]That was weird.
[152:02.66]it's election day here in two point county yo I got a crooked face it's like sideways the election through a bungalow my face is sideways it's amazing to think that that was jarring when I when it went the other way what if no one voted that year that's the mysterious one pioneering technology it looks pretty good anyway here's hoping that this year we'll get some boards in hard work may or may not pay off
[152:36.31]It's not what it looks like though.
[152:37.57]I mean, this is funny, but this is not what it looks like.
[153:03.74]Look like a hearthstone card.
[153:06.38]That doesn't even look like me.
[153:07.46]Okay, um... That was actually jarring when I swapped it the other way.
[153:27.13]Can I, let me finish this please.
[153:29.05]University gives you a bright future and clouds it with debt.
[153:34.95]Doesn't this look like, okay, this looks like, um, image one of my Tinder profile.
[153:43.62]Like, I don't think anyone's going to notice that.
[153:46.84]This is a, this is a Tinder picture.
[153:50.16]Not looking in the camera, making sure the edit looks good.
[153:53.77]That I look perfect.
[153:54.63]I'm not looking at it.
[153:55.17]I'm looking at it.
[153:55.71]I'm looking right now at the active real-time editing of my face.
[153:59.39]Like, yeah, that looks good.
[154:00.73]I'm going to screen cap that and I'm going to put that on Tinder.
[154:07.59]Yeah.
[154:07.85]And then my bio, all my bio is going to say is looking for 10s only.
[154:12.84]That's it.
[154:19.60]No, I bet you'll get plenty of dates.
[154:29.09]Alright.
[154:29.91]Stupid questions.
[154:31.23]Alright.
[154:31.69]I got to play this video game.
[154:38.44]Why is it so high up?
[154:39.82]Oh, it's a shelf.
[154:40.32]I thought it was a bookcase.
[154:46.08]Wait, I unlocked food, didn't I?
[154:47.95]Oh, not for this place.
[154:51.53]Alright, food.
[154:52.29]It's a culinary school.
[154:55.88]Alright, if we don't make food here and eat it, if we use the vending machine, then it's kind of messed up.
[155:04.45]I think you're catching the lens distortion from being on the wide... You know what?
[155:09.38]You're probably right.
[155:11.22]So the camera... The camera is not right in front of me.
[155:15.98]It's all the way over here because I don't want to get this in the frame.
[155:20.24]So I'm sitting on the very edge of the webcam.
[155:24.98]So I'm catching the very edge.
[155:26.40]If I were to drag this over, you'd see it.
[155:29.95]The camera's like over there.
[155:31.59]It's the camera.
[155:35.31]It's not my twisted face.
[155:39.57]Alright.
[155:40.19]We're good.
[155:41.25]Let the culinary school begin.
[155:43.28]What's wrong?
[155:47.32]Unresolved campus requirements.
[155:48.66]Oh, there's no teacher.
[155:53.48]That's a pretty big requirement.
[155:54.76]Alright, we're going with Ernest.
[155:59.42]Let's get a couple of janitors.
[156:06.48]Oh, just one.
[156:07.30]It's probably fine.
[156:12.56]Maybe that's extreme.
[156:13.16]You got to send people home.
[156:14.04]Private tuition room.
[156:15.28]I don't want to do a private tuition room.
[156:28.78]A gastronomy teacher to teach the culinary class.
[156:33.26]What is gastronomy?
[156:36.22]That sounds like a digestive doctor from outer space.
[156:41.90]It's like you double majored in the stars and also in the gut bacteria.
[156:52.74]Gastronomy.
[156:56.35]That is it.
[156:57.11]It's just food.
[156:58.45]Gastronomy.
[157:00.41]Food science.
[157:01.27]Oh, okay.
[157:01.83]That's cool.
[157:02.27]That's a cool name.
[157:08.39]Oh.
[157:09.25]Oh, they're all chefs.
[157:10.15]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[157:11.65]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[157:12.65]I need somebody for the library.
[157:19.86]They're all getting into chef clothes.
[157:27.52]Alright.
[157:30.56]It's time.
[157:36.14]Do I have to build a private room?
[157:38.71]Private tuition room.
[157:42.49]Um... No, I'm not.
[157:48.59]I'm not building a private tuition room.
[157:51.33]Unless it's one of these other rooms that goes away.
[157:58.72]Holy shit, that's a huge cake.
[158:00.00]Can I fit it here?
[158:06.28]I can.
[158:09.71]It's fine.
[158:14.49]It's like a room closet.
[158:17.55]It's alright though.
[158:34.93]Good.
[158:35.15]Alright, students get to private tuition for one-on-one help from a teacher.
[158:40.10]Requires a teacher to be qualified in the same course.
[158:43.48]Okay.
[158:43.78]Are we ready for our first lesson?
[158:46.62]Sure, I should have another teacher then.
[158:48.40]Alright, Gilbert Pillow.
[158:49.00]What?
[159:04.86]Private tuition.
[159:09.12]Alright, cool.
[159:10.74]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[159:19.60]Wait, they're sleeping in their chef costumes? ...
[159:37.17]Wait, the person is different.
[159:41.39]Are they different?
[159:47.45]When are they going to get in here and cook?
[160:03.49]Get in there and start making food.
[160:07.85]Oh, they have to learn how to make food.
[160:09.29]Staff are reminded to care about students.
[160:14.71]Oh shit, there's nobody here.
[160:16.27]They're just playing with the desk of the librarian.
[160:23.24]You got that from the bathroom.
[160:34.15]Alright, come on in.
[160:35.37]It's time to start cooking.
[160:43.41]Anybody need a private lesson?
[160:46.38]Nope.
[160:46.72]Friendship.
[160:50.24]Nice.
[160:53.40]These two are friends?
[161:01.52]Spends their nights dreaming of runny eggs and per- ugh, gross.
[161:04.50]Runny eggs.
[161:04.95]Disgusting.
[161:06.07]And perfect quenellis.
[161:08.39]And their days making food for their studies, themselves, and for others.
[161:12.60]Wards off hunger by eating their homework.
[161:14.36]Alright, here we go.
[161:15.34]Let's see what they do.
[161:23.60]It reminds me of those old Play-Doh of food makers.
[161:26.34]That's cute.
[161:35.93]That's an L egg opinion.
[161:44.01]I don't like over easy or runny eggs.
[161:46.90]I think they just ruin everything else.
[161:49.44]Now don't get me wrong.
[161:51.06]Do not twist my words around.
[161:52.50]I love eggs.
[161:55.25]Over medium eggs over cut from easy to medium is perfect.
[162:00.33]How many times do I have to have this conversation with everybody here?
[162:02.30]I don't know how many times I have to tell you guys this.
[162:04.66]When you have a plate of food.
[162:05.84]Hold on.
[162:06.14]Hold on.
[162:06.42]I want to hear what he says.
[162:07.30]Oh, he knows!
[162:07.62]He can hear us!
[162:28.66]Students are reminded to stop eating toilet water.
[162:31.84]OK, so.
[162:35.80]Eggs are not usually the only thing you eat.
[162:38.40]If you have a meal, whether it's breakfast, whether it's brunch or lunch, whatever you put your eggs on.
[162:46.90]Eggs is not the only thing that you have on the plate.
[162:49.73]So, there's usually eggs, bacon, sausage, tomato, toast, you know, it doesn't matter.
[162:55.37]Whatever's there.
[162:57.49]If you have a runny egg, when you touch the yolk, it just explodes and gets on every single other piece of food.
[163:07.99]It just kind of gets everywhere.
[163:09.91]And then it starts congealing and gets hard and weird.
[163:14.43]Over medium is perfect.
[163:15.59]And over easy to over medium.
[163:16.94]Somewhere in the middle.
[163:18.10]Because the egg is still kind of runny and jammy and soft.
[163:22.06]But it doesn't just explode everywhere and then turn into this mess on your plate.
[163:26.06]That's the point.
[163:27.07]But I don't want just egg yolk all over everything else that I'm eating.
[163:31.27]I want to choose to dip my sausage in the egg yolk.
[163:34.65]I don't want to be forced to have my sausage in the egg yolk.
[163:39.49]Right?
[163:39.89]I wouldn't be able to choose to do that.
[163:41.83]Sometimes you just want to bite a sausage that has no egg yolk on it, but sorry if you have a runny egg.
[163:46.60]Every bite has egg yolk on it.
[163:47.92]Every one.
[163:48.22]A student union?
[163:53.80]What's a student- Oh!
[163:54.42]How do I do that?
[163:56.93]Do I need that?
[164:02.73]Okay, Egg Karen.
[164:07.43]Yeah, anytime that I have a runny egg and I open it and I go, what the heck?
[164:12.27]What the hell?
[164:14.39]I open the egg and it runs all over the sausage.
[164:16.67]I lift up my phone and I start filming the whole plate.
[164:20.81]And I'm just like, I'm not happy about this.
[164:23.75]Not happy about what you've done here at all.
[164:27.09]Stupid.
[164:28.75]Then I post it to Facebook.
[164:32.36]And it gets two likes.
[164:36.52]Me
[164:42.79]And one person that is just like, I'm gonna do this just because.
[164:46.39]I, like, don't care, but... I don't care, but I, like, I have to, like, be in the fucking next room.
[164:56.98]Hard-boiled Andy?
[164:57.72]That's right.
[164:58.37]You mean, uh, Gigachad hard-boiled eggs?
[165:00.43]Fresh out of the, uh, out of the water?
[165:03.89]No, you're right, you're right.
[165:09.76]We have way too much inventory.
[165:12.48]Look at all this food that's not being used.
[165:17.51]We have 10 students.
[165:19.19]I have 40 areas.
[165:22.44]Soft-boiled egg?
[165:23.68]Mmm... Now that's good, because it's... It can't be runny, though.
[165:31.57]It has to be a jammy yolk.
[165:32.93]It has to be not a runny yolk.
[165:35.55]Somewhere in the middle.
[165:36.15]Hard-boiled eggs are sent from hell.
[165:39.17]Well, that's kind of unfortunate, because I'm about to eat a shitload of them after this stream is over.
[165:43.13]And I'm not making it up.
[165:45.28]You have a baby pallet.
[165:51.76]It's the same food.
[165:56.30]I'm the antichrist.
[165:57.88]It's the same food.
[166:01.72]Oh, dude, your palate is sort of fucking ten-year-old.
[166:05.86]We're both eating egg yolks.
[166:07.96]They're both the same exact food.
[166:09.48]I just like mine a little jammier than you like yours.
[166:12.32]It's the same food.
[166:13.44]Huh?
[166:19.11]Food is the same ingredients!
[166:20.79]It comes from the same- It comes out of the chicken's ass!
[166:23.46]It's the same food!

[171:12.89]Nice door.
[171:19.94]It's not done.
[171:20.88]You can't just criticize a work in progress.
[171:28.84]And you know what?
[171:29.70]You want to do better?
[171:31.76]You go get it.
[171:33.44]Which, by the way,
[171:36.36]I'm sure people know.
[171:40.89]What is that?
[171:41.19]What?
[171:41.39]Where is it?
[171:42.75]What is it available on?

[172:30.84]I actually want to get rid of this.
[172:32.66]OK, there we go.
[172:34.69]But what really happens during a test?
[172:37.95]You get a question.
[172:39.27]You write down your answer.
[172:41.15]And then some bozo tells you that you're wrong.
[172:46.76]Bozo.
[172:47.20]I need to pause the game.
[172:51.18]Bad at doors.
[172:51.70]I just want to because I can't delete this unless I move the door, but I can't get rid of the door.
[172:59.22]I didn't want to make a second door.
[173:00.58]What the heck?
[173:05.26]How do I... Oh, wait.
[173:07.82]There we go.
[173:12.59]Put two circles on it?
[173:15.29]Hold on.
[173:16.31]I'm busy.
[173:19.51]Shouldn't I be able just to delete the door?
[173:22.85]I should be able just to delete it, right?
[173:24.08]Okay.
[173:32.69]Oops.
[173:42.63]Will that fix it?
[173:45.49]I mean, that actually did work.
[173:50.87]Okay.
[173:52.02]Alright, now we need a student union, whatever it is.
[174:05.76]Oh shit, okay.
[174:15.42]Wait, this is just a bar.
[174:17.62]Student Union?
[174:18.30]Is that what it's called?
[174:39.09]Cool.
[174:51.88]Cool.
[175:03.36]Yep.
[175:35.30]Okay, I need an assistant.
[175:36.18]Let's move.
[175:36.46]Assistant.
[175:38.18]Let's see, is somebody going to be dancing?
[175:39.98]Events are a great way to promote healthy work-life balance.
[175:44.00]Alright.
[175:44.32]Make it schedule one party.
[175:46.42]Let's do a party.
[175:46.80]Okay, schedule.
[175:47.12]Select a room and then use the event setup button.
[176:06.16]Alright, let's do an SU party.
[176:12.35]It's $8,000.
[176:13.75]Okay, well, let's book it.
[176:20.71]Alright, $8,000.
[176:21.91]Okay, is it happening?
[176:29.94]They love the dance floor.
[176:35.52]They're having a blast.
[176:41.15]Eight grand for a party.
[176:55.54]There's only a few people there.
[176:57.54]There's only like two people here.
[177:12.20]Pause the stream.
[177:12.66]I need to go pee.
[177:14.08]You'll be alright.
[177:16.28]Just go.
[177:17.46]Just go right now.
[177:21.50]Just go right now.
[177:29.97]Holy shit.
[177:34.33]That tired me out.
[177:36.71]Watching that.
[177:37.17]That's a great move.
[177:44.79]Pause it so they can go pee?
[177:45.87]Is somebody not happy?
[177:53.25]No, you're fine.
[177:54.37]Okay.
[177:55.38]What are my objectives?
[177:56.84]Complete the party?
[177:57.64]The party was a success.
[178:01.50]There's a wide range of events that you can run on campus, so don't forget to spice up the academic year.
[178:04.88]Okay, cool.
[178:08.36]Let's hope they do okay.
[178:12.60]Make a funny film.
[178:15.46]Funny film?
[178:18.41]During the filming of Good Cop, Sad Cop, Roderick Cushion was forced to pass out blindfolds and earplugs to the crew.
[178:24.15]Let's make that, let's make a funny movie.
[178:26.25]Is it, is it, here it goes.
[178:27.73]$4,000 indie film.
[178:44.12]Pause the game.
[178:44.58]That guy has to pee.
[178:56.97]Just hold on.
[178:59.15]When are they filming the thing?
[179:05.26]Pause it.
[179:05.72]Okay.
[179:07.36]Go.
[179:09.26]Go.
[179:10.04]Go pee.
[179:11.02]Go on.
[179:14.38]You're gonna get 60 seconds.
[179:20.83]Wait, all of you are gone?
[179:22.85]Well, don't all of you go.
[179:26.57]Just that one guy that needed a minute or two.
[179:42.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[179:49.14]I'm not fucking waiting for anybody.
[179:50.12]You're gonna tell me what to do on my stream?
[179:53.09]Really?
[179:54.15]You're gonna say like, oh, stop your stream.
[179:56.15]Unattended sandwiches will be eaten by me.
[180:13.74]I'm really glad, by the way, that I spent $4,000 on screening this indie movie for a guy to show up 20 minutes into the film and it's one person.
[180:29.53]I'm paused.
[180:30.39]Look, my hands are up in the air.
[180:32.01]See?
[180:35.98]See?
[180:36.36]We're good.
[180:48.46]Are they back?
[180:50.57]Pause the facecam too.
[180:51.69]Okay, I can do that.
[181:26.58]Are they back?
[181:34.52]Do I want a French bread pizza?
[181:38.65]Oh, fuck yeah.
[181:39.23]I want two French bread pizzas.
[181:53.66]They're back?
[181:54.24]Alright, let's go.
[181:57.62]Wait, come on.
[181:58.44]The movie's starting.
[181:59.82]One, two, three, four.
[182:01.26]It's $4,000 a ticket.
[182:22.28]Explore a world of legend and land shops in Meat Wizard.
[182:28.07]Bro, you're halfway through the movie already.
[182:31.59]Only on the Bungle Button Master will the games be happening.
[182:38.54]This is the Among Us sound.
[182:39.74]It doesn't matter how desperate you are.
[182:42.76]No urinating on campus facilities.
[182:52.96]Where's the teacher?
[183:00.01]Where's the staff?
[183:05.79]Oh, he's just getting a drink.
[183:10.53]He's just getting a drink.
[183:15.90]Why did he drink the cheesy gubbins?
[183:17.92]Oh, come on, man.
[183:18.98]Don't do that.
[183:24.72]thrown it on the ground.
[183:29.38]I can't think of... I would never.
[183:31.20]That's just so rude.
[183:35.28]That's so unbelievably rude.
[183:40.71]I can't even imagine.
[183:41.91]There are no garbage cans?
[183:48.61]Yes, there is.
[184:00.80]This one right here.
[184:10.70]This... This dickhead has one in his office.
[184:13.26]What do you mean?
[184:14.86]He has one in his office?
[184:16.42]He has one of... One of two trash cans are in his office.
[184:27.89]This person is really smart.
[184:30.92]Level 7.
[184:40.09]There we go.
[184:44.63]We got a B student.
[184:48.60]People want club sandwiches?
[184:49.76]Powered nap?
[184:50.38]What is this?
[185:02.51]This is a strange looking machine.
[185:04.83]What is this thing?
[185:09.35]It's a power nap stand.
[185:13.41]Oh, I thought you sleep on here.
[185:15.01]I was like, oh, OK.
[185:19.89]Let's see what it does.
[185:22.53]Check it out.
[185:24.41]It's a sleep club.
[185:28.86]You ever thought about why they're so keen to teach us to read?
[185:32.64]Think about it.
[185:34.22]So we can read what they write.
[185:37.22]It makes so much sense when you think about it.
[185:41.61]It's just another way for them to control us.
[185:45.11]That's why I only trust the Daily Disorder for my news.
[185:49.70]They take the regular news and turn every word into... Alright, the end of the year, how do we do it?
[185:57.85]B minus?
[185:58.37]That's not bad.
[186:04.06]Everyone seems to be happy.
[186:04.98]I got a couple of rewards.
[186:09.88]Everyone seems fine.
[186:12.56]Oh, this is Pastry Chef.
[186:18.81]We changed the channel on that guy.
[186:20.25]Sweet Kitchen.
[186:21.05]Oh.
[186:21.13]Oh.
[186:35.71]I can build somewhere else, right?
[186:38.43]That's a construction, right?
[186:42.25]Only three people join this.
[186:44.21]Did I unlock a new room?
[186:49.90]I thought I had a new room to play with.
[186:58.74]No?
[187:04.60]Where would you put it?
[187:05.46]That's I think I did not unlock a new space like oh yeah, right here.
[187:08.28]OK.
[187:12.53]With buildings empty up, just I don't want to do it.
[187:15.55]Make it 10 grand.
[187:16.23]I don't care.
[187:19.13]This is way bigger now, OK?
[187:22.61]Uh.
[187:25.85]So what am I going to put in here?
[187:26.83]Dessert thing?
[187:30.40]Up the quality on your webcam.
[187:32.98]Yeah, I just, I don't, webcams I don't care about.
[187:39.58]See, the problem is this thing has this stupid, um, auto exposure that, even if I turn it, I, webcams are such dog shit, they really are.
[187:49.77]It's so bad.
[187:52.01]So, uh, I can't really mess with the settings on this.
[188:01.34]What if I do this?
[188:03.30]Oh, let me try something.
[188:12.14]Yeah, so it does this auto exposure that if I turn off auto exposure, it goes just dark.
[188:21.93]So this is it without auto exposure on.
[188:25.19]And keep in mind, I have a ring light glaring into my face right now.
[188:30.97]It doesn't make any sense.
[188:33.61]It doesn't make any sense.
[188:37.47]I have a light right here.
[188:38.43]I'm going to turn it as bright as possible.
[188:44.64]That's as bright as this goes, and it is filling this room and burning into my face.
[188:53.16]And if I turn the exposure up just a little bit, now look at this, we're at like 10 FPS.
[189:00.56]Right?
[189:01.98]Put it down again with the ISO changes.
[189:05.33]Yeah, it's annoying.
[189:08.49]And then when I hit auto exposure here, it blows me out.
[189:12.83]I don't get it.
[189:16.40]It's annoying.
[189:17.28]That's for sure.
[189:22.44]Turn the room light on.
[189:23.80]It is on.
[189:28.19]You have no idea how actually bright that really is.
[189:29.85]It hurts.
[189:33.92]What is going to be 20 FPS, Andy?
[189:40.03]Oh, also, keep in mind, I know I'm looking at you here.
[189:43.53]What's that?
[189:47.67]Also, keep in mind.
[189:50.13]Change the gain.
[189:50.77]Yeah, if I turn the gain down or turn it up, it does the same thing.
[189:56.71]It's weird.
[189:58.11]Let me try that and see if I look like an idiot.
[190:02.40]Uh, Sunday is green screen movie night part two.
[190:05.60]So nothing tomorrow, but we'll be back on Sunday for green screen.
[190:08.44]That's going to be a fun one.
[190:09.30]Let me try this.
[190:10.07]So let's turn this on.
[190:11.07]So that's that.
[190:11.45]And then if I turn the gain up here, we'll try it.
[190:30.27]The more you revise, the longer you've been revising.
[190:41.34]Is that better?
[190:45.16]Am I in 60 FPS?
[190:56.81]Is that like way better?
[191:00.39]Contrast is a little too high though, isn't it?
[191:01.71]How's that?
[191:11.55]I think that's actually better.
[191:12.45]I think we're good now.
[191:19.41]You can see all the gross individual hairs on my beard.
[191:22.15]Because it's darkening them.
[191:27.54]Whatever.
[191:29.58]That's with the exposure down and the gain up.
[191:34.98]Hey, we really loved the sponsored content when you were fixing your camera.
[191:40.27]We're having a fucking blast in Two Point Campus.
[191:50.37]I actually, this game's really fun.
[191:52.11]I actually, I like Two Point Hospital as well.
[191:55.69]So that's not surprising to me.
[191:57.73]Sorry, it's not surprising to me.
[191:59.96]Alright, let's upgrade this.
[192:00.78]I can have 15 students now.
[192:04.10]Upgrade.
[192:06.56]We are not you.
[192:15.20]Yep, this is a sponsored stream.
[192:22.03]And this stream will be over very soon.
[192:27.65]Omega camera?
[192:32.02]You keep the chef hat on?
[192:34.04]Hey, yo, hey, Jerma, what platforms is this game on?
[192:42.54]Well, I'll tell you in just a second.
[193:04.58]So first of all, this is the platforms you can get this on.
[193:09.39]It's on.
[193:11.35]It's on.
[193:13.23]It's on.
[193:14.57]And who could forget?
[193:15.68]And of course it is.
[193:18.82]Check it out on those places.
[193:20.49]If you missed it.
[193:20.85]It's on.
[193:21.21]It's on.
[193:21.55]And.
[193:21.65]And.
[193:21.73]Get it on those platforms.
[193:22.45]I forgot where I put them, but whatever.
[193:24.39]What's wrong with this?
[193:25.13]Oh, I thought this person was sad.
[193:47.22]The dance floor is like Club Penguin.
[193:48.62]Aw, that's so sweet.
[193:49.16]That's so sweet.
[193:49.84]That's so cute.
[194:20.61]That reminds me of this one time when I opened up my... And I looked to see what was on sale.
[194:27.87]What was available.
[194:29.73]And lo and behold, Two Point Campus was on... And it was just such an awe... I could take it into the bathroom.
[194:37.51]And I called my friend, Dave.
[194:39.71]And I was like, Dave, I know you've got... And I know that you're looking for something fun to play with.
[194:45.33]Is he trying to make a joke?
[194:47.05]Yeah.
[194:47.15]Yeah.
[194:53.61]Frequently asked questions.
[194:55.65]No, you can't have an extension.
[195:02.56]That hurt.
[195:06.28]It's in there somewhere.
[195:07.38]This is a joke.
[195:08.90]Why does this bed stink?
[195:12.08]What's wrong with it?
[195:14.06]Why does this bed stink?
[195:17.25]This bed smells.
[195:19.93]That's not going to do anything.
[195:20.95]You could have changed the sheets.
[195:29.09]Why would a bed smell that bad?
[195:30.65]That's something wrong.
[195:31.57]Alright, you're gonna fucking smoke us out here.
[195:46.42]Don't do it on every single bed.
[195:48.02]Did somebody die?
[195:54.68]No.
[196:09.48]Oh no, he's filling the room with gas.
[196:12.87]This is really popular.
[196:13.83]People love this.
[196:14.43]Why won't anybody join this club?
[196:18.49]Only three people.
[196:19.49]How do I make, how do I promote it?
[196:34.89]I never went to college at least I don't remember going to college anyway I turned out just fine you hit all the flies when the day sun goes bye-bye and the spooky white beach ball casts down its dark favor on us all oh no never mind this I thought there was a swarm of flies not a real announcement
[197:02.38]It's just like chatter.
[197:03.94]I thought it was like... Just like a million flies.
[197:07.36]Okay.
[197:12.86]I was supposed to make a... Oh, right.
[197:15.86]A cake place.
[197:19.12]A sweet kitchen.
[197:20.06]Where's the entrance right there?
[197:23.00]I'll do it right here.
[197:23.88]Is that good enough?
[197:30.96]No, it is not.
[197:46.45]Item blocked.
[197:48.56]What's blocking it?
[197:51.52]Item blocked.
[197:53.48]Item blocked.
[197:55.82]Why?
[197:56.60]Why is item blocked?
[197:57.68]Can't use it here?
[198:16.74]Why can I use it here?
[198:17.36]Do I need more space around the machine?
[198:23.83]I don't think so.
[198:24.51]Maybe I do.
[198:29.12]I want to see this thing in action.
[198:45.47]What the hell is this?
[198:46.27]Speed walking club?
[198:47.51]Okay.
[199:27.76]Will somebody come this way?
[199:28.68]Oh, there's no door.
[199:32.74]How do they get over there?
[199:37.22]How do they actually get over here?
[199:46.11]They can't come out this way.
[199:47.73]Oh, they.
[199:51.41]They just walk from here all the way across.
[199:57.09]Plagiarism is not a belief system.
[200:05.63]Oh, I only have 900 bucks.
[200:07.01]You're right.
[200:13.72]Can they not leave?
[200:14.58]No, they can leave.
[200:19.96]Can they?
[200:20.30]They're not trapped in here, right?
[200:24.62]Drink some water.
[200:25.18]Alright.
[200:27.34]I will.
[200:32.38]They can't leave the dance floor?
[200:41.71]I actually think I have to connect it somehow.
[200:55.52]Does even a single one of your students know the spell lines access to Northgate?
[200:59.11]I don't think so.
[200:59.85]Bad teacher Andy.
[201:07.71]Let me go to the map.
[201:08.53]I'm curious about something.
[201:09.27]I want to see how many zones there are.
[201:21.68]This one's like medieval themed.
[201:25.10]This is the original one.
[201:25.92]This is the one we're on now.
[201:30.76]This one looks like it unlocks, maybe.
[201:34.60]Is this a baseball kind of stadium?
[201:38.82]This one over here.
[201:42.34]Is there a sandbox mode?
[201:44.40]I'm curious.
[201:50.42]Did you take a shower?
[201:51.20]There is a sandbox mode.
[201:54.59]Oh, you have to, like, beat the game.
[201:55.72]Okay.
[201:57.20]Okay.
[201:58.24]That's cool.
[202:00.60]Well, you have to get at least through the game.
[202:06.10]This is a Jerm of stand-in.
[202:08.96]I can see how you feel that way.
[202:09.96]Alright, let's go back.
[202:14.18]What are we doing?
[202:16.48]Yeah, we'll be like, another five minutes.
[202:23.13]You need to do the first four levels?
[202:30.29]Jerma, genuine question.
[202:31.19]How do you manage your pain levels when your chronic pain flares up?
[202:35.49]Um... If I'm really honest, distractions help.
[202:43.93]And this is kind of one of them.
[202:46.95]Whenever I'm just kind of sitting there hanging out and I don't care about the shitty way that I feel a lot of time, I kind of just put it back here and it's not accessed.
[203:00.94]You probably see from time to time, you probably pick up on it.
[203:04.34]When I go like this, that's me going like, oof.
[203:11.44]Anytime that you can see the letters down here, when I go like that, um,
[203:18.25]And it is there.
[203:19.13]It always is.
[203:21.43]But I just do it.
[203:23.41]And I just try to put it back here and just not put it in the front of my head.
[203:27.03]And it's crazy that if you do that, if you actually try to just distract yourself with stuff, you don't focus on it.
[203:34.05]And I know that sounds really, like, yeah, man, like, it sucks.
[203:38.04]It does.
[203:38.86]But I'm right now having fun.
[203:41.56]I'm having fun playing this game, hanging out, being a dickhead on stream.
[203:47.20]So, like, I don't have time to care about that.
[203:49.68]I don't have the capacity to give a shit about that right now.
[203:52.25]Right?
[203:55.05]And also, go to your doctor, too.
[203:57.01]Pain management's a huge pain in the ass.
[203:58.77]It really is.
[204:00.35]There's so many weird, dumb things that our body does for no reason that you really should have a program with your doctor.
[204:13.46]Yeah, it's a lot of distractions.
[204:18.04]The more that I have, like, fun, the more that it's not a thing that I care about.
[204:27.36]And it sucks when the stream turns off and I'm just kind of lying in bed.
[204:30.56]It's like, oh, what the... That's annoying.
[204:35.60]Excuse me.
[204:37.04]Yeah.
[204:39.64]Oh, yeah.
[204:42.60]But that's just the fact.
[204:50.99]Thanks for the cool streams.
[204:52.69]Hey, thanks for being here.
[204:56.33]I'm glad you're here.
[204:58.20]Let's have some fun.
[205:00.35]And with that, I'll see you guys later.
[205:02.66]That's it.
[205:05.46]If streaming helps manage pain, why do- well, let me make this really clear.
[205:09.92]It's not like the act of streaming that's managing my pain symptoms.
[205:15.12]It's just one of a few- one of many things that can distract me from the current problem.
[205:20.89]Make no mistake about it, the reason why I only stream two, three days a week is because it actually does become a problem after I sit here for a long time.
[205:27.29]Um, then I'm not- hey, guys, I'm managing my pain with Twitch streams.
[205:32.52]That's not- that's not what I mean.
[205:39.54]Yeah, that's Two Point Campus.
[205:42.40]I give it a stamp of recommendation.
[205:43.96]I know the stream is sponsored, but I mean, it's a fun, tongue-in-cheek, light-hearted management kind of tycoon type game.
[205:53.83]It's fun.
[205:54.31]It just is.
[205:54.97]These games are fun.
[205:55.83]There's no other way I can spin that for you.
[205:57.29]It's available on, you know...
[206:04.81]Devs obviously I appreciate the sponsor.
[206:08.29]So thank you to the two point campus devs back.
[206:12.20]It's a great game.
[206:12.98]I think it's really fun.
[206:15.30]I actually think it's a fun game.
[206:18.04]Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[206:20.42]If you want it, if you wanted to, you know, do your own.
[206:23.96]Get on Steam right now.
[206:27.34]Seems like there's a lot of content seems promising.
[206:33.42]Is it on Switch?
[206:34.34]Yes, it is.
[206:37.17]And then Cult of the Lamb, you will see that.
[206:40.73]I will bring Cult of the Lamb back after baseball.
[206:46.21]I got a lot of things lined up after baseball.
[206:54.73]Yeah, then that game was really good too.
[206:57.85]Two solid video games back to back today.
[207:01.74]Yeah, that's going to end the stream.
[207:03.02]That'll end this sponsor segment as well.
[207:06.64]Go support these devs because they supported the channel.
[207:09.76]So that's huge.
[207:12.06]Special thanks to Two Point Campus.
[207:14.37]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[207:26.94]There's a green screen tomorrow.
[207:27.80]Green screen is Sunday.
[207:29.64]Sunday at 4 p.m.
[207:31.80]Pacific.
[207:34.18]Sunday at 4 p.m.
[207:35.08]Pacific.
[207:36.42]Not tomorrow.
[207:48.06]Yeah.
[207:48.39]Take care, everybody.
[207:49.21]See you soon.
[208:01.28]I think there are more than 100 green screen videos we're going to be watching.
[208:07.97]I know for a fact that there's at least three to four hours, I think, of content that we have not seen yet.
[208:12.95]So it should be exciting stuff.
[208:17.77]I agree.
[208:18.17]Yeah, you should.
[208:21.09]It's been about six hours here.
[208:23.30]You've been potentially watching for a long time.
[208:25.28]I would hydrate if you haven't.
[208:34.93]Yeah, see you on Sunday.
[208:36.01]Green screen, movie night, part two.
[208:52.30]Have a great night.
[208:55.88]Oh, and of course, call your mother.
[209:00.71]See you guys Sunday.
[209:49.06]you
[210:23.96]you
[210:58.82]you
