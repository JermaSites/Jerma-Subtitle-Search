[00:00.68]Hello?
[00:02.18]Hello?
[00:04.00]Can anyone hear me talking?
[00:08.00]What the fuck is going on?
[00:09.34]Oh, I think I need to refresh.
[00:21.36]It says my stream is live, but I can't see anybody typing.
[00:26.32]Hold on, let me see if this works.
[00:32.68]I think I'm live.
[00:33.68]Yeah, okay, now I can see.
[00:40.86]That was weird.
[00:41.48]Alright, so anyways, back to Nancy Drew.
[00:48.57]And the Salem mystery.
[00:52.55]I need to pop this out.
[00:53.45]Hold on.
[00:54.35]Because this one died over here.
[01:01.45]Shit.
[01:02.31]How do I get this to refresh?
[01:04.49]Refresh, please!
[01:07.75]Oh, no.
[01:08.67]Okay, I'm gonna have to pop you out over here.
[01:15.01]He doesn't know?
[01:16.25]Is it off again?
[01:16.86]Alright, I think...
[01:28.76]Why can't I open the chat?
[01:30.32]I can't even open, like, my Twitch chat room.
[01:37.66]No!
[01:43.34]Alright, I can see you over here, but you're in a really bad spot.
[01:54.53]Alright, I can see you over here.
[01:56.69]Alright, here we go.
[02:03.41]But how will he hear all about- I streamed it, I can see, I can see.
[02:08.17]Yeah, when it died, I lost connection to, like, stream labs, and then it killed everything.
[02:15.25]Anyways, hi.
[02:16.33]That was... I guess, whatever.
[02:18.89]I don't know what my brain was doing.
[02:23.27]I just hovered over, run 60 second ad break.
[02:26.43]Like, I was gonna run an ad?
[02:28.35]That would be horrendous.
[02:31.13]Alright, here we go.
[02:38.68]Alright, grandpa, right?
[02:39.70]Grandpa.
[02:42.53]Here we go.
[02:45.97]120 second ad.
[02:48.05]Dude, that's the second time that the stream has just turned off.
[02:57.85]And then come right back totally normally, completely fine.
[03:03.51]I probably would rather just have that than horrible issues all day.
[03:08.40]Alright, where's this?
[03:09.18]Where's this?
[03:09.54]What's this thing?
[03:10.14]What is this?
[03:10.96]It's a U. Alright, I need to find a U. Ceiling?
[03:17.46]Is something on the ceiling?
[03:18.38]Wait, can I move it?
[03:20.98]This is master difficulty.
[03:23.13]Can I leave the room?
[03:25.63]I can't even leave the room.
[03:37.17]Oh no, you're not getting any ads.
[03:40.29]Stream went down, and I'm not coming back with an ad after that.
[03:49.46]Oh, great.
[03:50.88]You know, that room used to be a prison cell.
[03:54.08]Mosam Castle was the site of the most famous and violent witch trials in Austrian history.
[04:00.91]I don't care.
[04:02.23]I know that's like the whole point of the game, but I just- where's the U?
[04:06.06]Am I missing something over here?
[04:07.94]Under the button?
[04:30.70]I need a U key.
[04:34.77]Here's the thing though, I know you guys don't know where it is either.
[04:41.59]So I don't feel bad because I know you don't know.
[04:44.30]I swear to god, if you slide the bookcase over into the key under there.
[04:59.37]We don't know.
[05:00.13]I know.
[05:00.55]What about this?
[05:08.42]Just spam tab go over interactive menus?
[05:11.24]It's not anything to do with like the candle thing?
[05:15.64]It has to.
[05:16.10]There really isn't much here.
[05:28.65]The books!
[05:29.31]It's in the books!
[05:37.46]The books!
[05:38.10]It's in the books!
[05:46.88]The window!
[05:47.42]I don't- I don't- Going to Amateur wouldn't even change anything.
[05:59.50]Is it like all the way in the back with the- the- the spot where you cut it out and put- had a key?
[06:05.45]Leave the room.
[06:06.43]I don't think I can- can I leave this room?
[06:08.65]Dr. Hearst?
[06:09.45]Yes?
[06:10.29]Can I leave?
[06:12.31]How long have I known my dad?
[06:14.17]I'll get back, take all- Dr. Hearst, how long have I known my dad for?
[06:22.83]Uh, well, wait- There really isn't much here.
[06:28.66]I'm just trapped in the room.
[06:31.10]There's nothing I can do.
[06:32.08]Is there a... Find the key?
[06:40.21]They're really... They're... They're real... They're real... They're really...
[06:57.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[06:57.84]It's about hiding something.
[06:59.25]Give Earth to my prayer.
[07:01.17]Give ear to my prayer, oh God.
[07:03.73]And hide not yourself from my plea for mercy.
[07:05.73]Give ear to my prayer, oh God.
[07:07.75]And hide not yourself from my plea for mercy.
[07:09.91]Give ear to my prayer, oh God.
[07:12.18]God have mercy.
[07:13.08]I feel like this is me streaming.
[07:16.22]Just replace the stuff between oh God with what's happening on the video game.

[08:00.43]Other side?
[08:00.83]There's one over here too.
[08:08.53]Hold right mouse button to rotate the item.
[08:15.98]Hmm.
[08:17.80]Click on the item to interact.
[08:20.08]What the fuck?
[08:21.98]I did it!
[08:23.38]Okay, it's one of those games.
[08:24.84]I didn't think it was one of those games, and it is.
[08:29.61]What's in here?
[08:30.41]What a clever desk.
[08:32.21]It even comes with a labyrinth.
[08:33.65]Yeah, get fucked.
[08:35.45]You thought you were gonna get to my porn stash?
[08:39.83]Let's see you in this maze.
[08:42.23]You fucking idiot.
[08:44.42]You'll never get my porn.
[08:51.89]Oh shit, that was wicked easy, but not this one!
[08:55.95]This one's even harder.
[08:58.21]There's some pawns in there.
[09:00.05]You'll never fucking get in there.
[09:01.80]I found it.
[09:02.88]It's here.
[09:03.68]What?
[09:04.90]Really?
[09:06.02]Amazing.
[09:07.14]It's locked behind some sort of cage, though.
[09:10.10]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:10.96]The lock says A-W.
[09:15.33]Any idea?
[09:16.01]A-W root there.
[09:16.81]It's a password.
[09:18.48]Oh shit!
[09:19.22]I shouldn't have shown you that!
[09:20.45]The ghost fucking like flies through.
[09:26.39]We're in another leather?
[09:28.57]Hey, Jerma sucks.
[09:30.09]Thanks for the 15 subs.
[09:31.15]I missed the first one.
[09:33.29]But thank you for the 10 community subs right here.
[09:34.83]Thank you.
[09:37.65]Thank you for the huge amount of subs, Jerma sucks.
[09:40.83]Take it back to the shop.
[09:41.83]Oh no.
[09:42.17]Alright, so let's get it.
[09:48.65]How do I pick it up?
[09:51.00]It's locked with a leather belt.
[09:54.24]How do I grab it?
[09:56.88]Is it on fire?
[09:58.76]Is it burning?
[09:59.32]Is it too hot?
[10:01.06]Oh, I can leave.
[10:05.31]Nancy!
[10:06.45]This way!
[10:08.77]Where is that?
[10:09.65]Dr. Hurst?
[10:14.29]Incoming call.
[10:17.15]Deirdre, can I call you back?
[10:19.16]I'm in the middle of... A storm.
[10:20.14]Can I hang up?
[10:20.72]Deirdre, I have to call you back.
[10:21.80]Deirdre, Deirdre, there's a tornado.
[10:23.22]I can't talk to you.
[10:23.96]My boy!
[10:24.10]Get off!
[10:43.06]Let's talk about it.
[10:43.72]Quick, hurry!
[10:44.12]Imagine having to run fast and you just move forward two feet.
[10:45.97]I'm running!
[11:11.57]That person was running like an animal.
[11:14.71]They had their hands down, like running on all fours.
[11:17.17]Is it a werewolf?
[11:19.01]Dancy, you can't do that.
[11:20.03]That'll hurt.
[11:23.81]Quick, run!
[11:31.08]Someone's pushing me from behind.
[11:33.10]No, I don't want to do it!
[11:35.52]Quick, fucking sprint!
[11:36.30]Gotta move slowly.

[13:13.65]Here look the ANW root beer key and It's got a weird pattern on it at me.
[13:19.55]We might have to put that in a weird pattern Wouldn't you want your locked box to have a very basic standard key?
[13:28.08]Because I know that this key goes to that.
[13:30.23]What?
[13:30.33]How do you make a homemade... It's like Chef Boyardee and battery acid?
[13:38.91]I don't understand.
[13:39.41]Can smoke bomb?
[13:57.61]Okay.
[13:59.25]Well, I got it.
[14:01.23]Oh my god.
[14:02.49]Don't hang up on me!
[14:03.81]Chug what's left.
[14:17.19]Well, she's gotten into some trouble here, and I thought I could help her out.
[14:22.01]But it turns out the situation is much more complicated than I anticipated.
[14:27.46]So now I'm calling you to ask for some guidance.
[14:33.62]You want my help?
[14:35.80]Yes.
[14:36.28]Don't make this more painful.
[14:38.46]I could use your professional opinion, okay?
[14:42.56]Well, it so happens that the case I'm on is connected to Boston, which is just nearby Salem.
[14:50.17]And I was never a big believer in coincidences.
[14:53.31]Oh, are you sure?
[14:56.09]I'd love to.
[14:57.61]Seriously?
[14:58.63]I thought I had reached a dead end, but it looks like I have to go to Massachusetts anyway.
[15:04.01]In any case, a fresh perspective would do me good.
[15:06.79]Ugh, you're already annoying me, and you're not even here yet.
[15:12.05]Depth of field, she's focusing on the can.
[15:16.46]Yeah, but if I look over here, my eyes are ripped down, still focused on the can?
[15:24.50]That would hurt.
[15:28.85]Automatic one-letter grade if I could drive this.
[15:31.83]I appreciate you coming here, Drew.
[15:35.15]I'm just glad you didn't change your mind and leave me at the airport.
[15:37.91]Might have crossed my mind.
[15:40.50]Keep the excessive cheeriness under control and we'll be fine.
[15:45.80]Hey, eyes on the road.
[15:46.90]No promises.
[15:48.88]Where were you, by the way?
[15:50.66]Eyes on the road!
[15:51.37]Eyes on the road.
[15:52.19]Did I interrupt a vacation with Ned?
[15:55.19]Didn't you bring me here to help with a case?
[15:58.05]Yes, I did.
[15:59.71]And that's it.
[16:01.93]The house wasn't completely destroyed, but the person who lived there had to move out.
[16:17.37]Oh, you drive a stick!
[16:18.61]Why am I leaning the other way?
[16:21.18]I'm like sitting down and looking up.
[16:22.24]Where am I?
[16:22.66]Why was I down there?
[16:36.41]This is the car ride?
[16:38.21]I'm going to tell you how it is car ride.
[16:40.41]I have done this a couple of times, Deirdre.
[16:43.55]And in my experience, we can cover twice as much ground if we work side by side.
[16:48.45]I, you know, respect your experience and whatever, but family trumps experience.
[16:55.24]It's sensitive, and I don't want you messing it up by being too... What is that?
[17:00.04]To what?
[17:00.44]To you.
[17:02.86]What is that?
[17:03.88]Is that an ejector?
[17:06.28]You can't see where your mouse is.
[17:11.10]Oh, it's that problem again.
[17:13.86]You can't see where my fucking mouse is.
[17:15.52]God damn it.
[17:15.84]Alright, where's my mouse?
[17:17.26]No, no, no.
[17:18.92]This thing over here before it gets cut off.
[17:31.21]The thing all the way to the right looks like an ejector seat.
[17:34.65]Thing.
[17:35.23]The lever.
[17:35.75]Alright, let me fix this.
[17:36.61]How did I fix this last time?
[17:47.46]How did I fix this last... I think the stream crashing broke this.
[17:50.47]I think I just broke it.
[18:01.49]It was like that before too.
[18:06.65]Is that gonna work?
[18:09.87]What the fuck?
[18:14.29]I broke it.
[18:20.27]Alright, capture the screen.
[18:27.11]Why is it scaling?
[18:28.69]Oh, I hate this program with a passion.
[18:31.65]This is it.
[18:32.53]This is it.
[18:33.25]This is the stream where I don't use Streamlabs OBS ever again.
[18:36.91]This is it.
[18:37.36]This is the one.
[18:38.18]Okay.
[18:39.14]Not using it ever again.
[18:40.60]Alright, so.
[18:46.86]Are you going to capture the fucking screen?
[18:48.38]What are you doing?
[18:53.27]It's not even right.
[18:54.69]It's incorrect.
[19:00.10]What the fuck are you doing?
[19:03.94]What the fuck are you doing?
[19:05.98]I made it worse?
[19:13.51]No, I didn't.
[19:15.19]Clipping?
[19:16.33]Where?
[19:33.39]Professional streamer.
[19:35.36]No, professional streamer using shit software is what happens.
[19:47.60]Alright, let's go.
[19:52.71]Why don't we start with your extended family?
[19:55.30]They're cousins.
[19:57.08]The Perrys.
[19:58.60]P-A-R-R-Y.
[20:01.72]Oh.
[20:02.46]Like in fencing?
[20:03.78]Yes.
[20:05.42]Tegan is the older one.
[20:07.08]Mae is younger.
[20:08.60]They've... They had a difficult childhood, okay?
[20:12.08]And now Mae is suspected of committing arson on the most important historic mansion in Salem.
[20:20.12]And I know it's not true.
[20:22.36]I know it.
[20:26.60]We haven't taken a single turn by the way.
[20:31.74]This is, wherever we're going is in a straight line.
[20:34.92]Uh, this is a, alright, we've never, we've taken one turn.
[20:39.86]What can you tell me about Mae?
[20:41.78]She has a reputation as a troublemaker.
[20:43.70]I feel like I'm sitting in a studio of being manipulated.
[20:46.92]Maybe a bit odd at times.
[20:48.16]This is being keyed in.
[20:48.98]We haven't moved.
[20:49.58]Sometimes she can even sense things before they happen.
[20:53.10]Odd how?
[20:54.14]I don't know.
[20:55.12]Troubled teen stuff.
[20:56.71]Difficult time as a kid.
[20:59.45]The oddest thing is, she won't give an alibi.
[21:02.99]That would be seen as suspicious.
[21:05.53]That's the problem.
[21:07.33]Everyone is so suspicious of her.
[21:10.77]Prejudice, yes.
[21:12.19]Because of, well, you'll see.
[21:15.82]Sounds like we should talk to her soon.
[21:18.12]Where do you think we're going?
[21:24.74]What does Tegan think about this?
[21:26.88]She's worried about Mae, obviously.
[21:29.64]Tegan isn't like Mae.
[21:31.14]She's... upstanding.
[21:33.60]She works at the Salem Museum and doesn't know a thing about criminal cases.
[21:37.83]Which is why she contacted me.
[21:43.31]Is there a, like, I don't have any more questions?
[21:45.85]I don't have one more question.
[21:47.74]I don't want, I don't have any more questions.
[21:49.58]The Hathorne house?
[21:51.40]And it's old?
[21:52.92]Alright, we got it.
[21:53.54]There's the house.
[21:55.18]The Perry house.
[22:15.85]What do you mean haunted?
[22:17.49]Get out of the car, Nancy.
[22:19.01]Exactly that.
[22:20.95]There's ghosts.
[22:22.89]Deirdre.
[22:24.08]I don't believe it either, Drew.
[22:26.38]But I can't explain it.
[22:29.12]Everyone seems to think they exist.
[22:31.66]With so many sightings, even if it isn't real ghosts, something is definitely going on.
[22:37.76]I thought that maybe you can disprove them.
[22:41.98]So would you please get out of my car and come inside?
[22:52.42]This looks like a house that's currently occupied.
[22:54.48]If we're going to work, side by side, you'd better learn to keep up with me.
[22:59.42]Who- oh.
[23:04.77]You must be Nancy.
[23:05.91]Thank you so much for coming.
[23:07.45]Am I- is this like a... Do I, like, investigate ghosts?
[23:10.97]You know, you live in the same neighborhood for 20 years, and you'd expect your neighbors to be a little more understanding when your family is falsely accused of a horrific crime.
[23:17.71]Did Nancy Drew do this before The Conjuring?
[23:19.21]Oh, I'm sorry.
[23:20.21]How are you, Deirdre?
[23:22.57]I'm good, thanks.
[23:25.33]Tegan Perry, welcome to my home.
[23:27.47]Welcome, hi.
[23:28.05]Well, our home, although right now my parents are literally on safari in Namibia, so while their daughter is being convicted of a crime she didn't commit, I'm taking care of things around here.
[23:36.98]Alright.
[23:37.66]They'll be home soon.
[23:39.22]We're, uh... A very expensive courier is tracking them down in the bush.
[23:43.92]Top notch, I found them on the internet.
[23:45.96]Deirdre tells me you'll be assisting her in clearing my sister's name.
[23:49.89]assisting yeah yeah yeah I don't know why she won't help herself she's got a difficult reputation okay well you know dear draw what people here can be like she doesn't trust easily not I'm sorry are you hungry there's clam chowder oh man oh clam chowder I wear a fucking do it or a fucking black did I remember black you do it dear dread sorry you're bunking with me
[24:15.08]Oh, I almost forgot.
[24:16.49]After you girls get comfortable, you two should swing by the museum.
[24:19.51]Might as well take in some history while you're here, right?
[24:22.95]Just don't get suckered into that witch's walking tour.
[24:26.30]Olivia Ravencroft is not a witch.
[24:28.98]She would have you believing all kinds of nonsense about the town being full of goat.
[24:33.18]I thought you two used to be friends.
[24:34.78]That was a long time ago.
[24:36.49]Look, I'm sorry.
[24:37.53]I gotta get going.
[24:38.21]Running late.
[24:38.57]Running late to an appointment.
[24:39.63]There's the bad.
[24:40.17]That's the villain.
[24:40.59]Thanks, Tegan.
[24:41.49]I appreciate you letting us stay.
[24:42.57]That's the villain with the smoke.
[24:43.83]Before you go, do you have time for a quick question?
[24:46.59]Nancy, we just got here.
[24:48.75]That's the only thing you eat in Boston.
[24:50.10]Sorry.
[24:50.54]I know you're in a rush.
[24:51.84]It would really help.
[24:53.28]Of course.
[24:53.96]I have time for one question.
[24:55.28]If it'll help.
[24:58.09]Why can't you tell me where the fire happened?
[24:59.93]Do you mind introducing me to Mae?
[25:06.56]What can you tell me about the fire?
[25:08.06]That's the quickest way to know that you are responsible.
[25:14.72]Hey, what about that fire?
[25:16.37]What do you know about the fire?
[25:17.27]What do you know about that?
[25:19.73]Oh, I know.
[25:21.63]I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.
[25:24.35]I just thought, since the Hathorne house is important to the town, you must know about it.
[25:29.12]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[25:31.12]Yes, John Hathorne was one of Salem's founders.
[25:34.18]His large house estate was the oldest surviving structure from Salem.
[25:37.74]Oh, is that all?
[25:39.06]Uh-uh-uh.
[25:39.90]That was two questions.
[25:41.18]I said one.
[25:41.86]What?
[25:44.06]But, yes, he was also the big-time judge that presided over the Salem witch trial.
[25:49.19]Is there some other fire I need to know about?
[25:51.57]No.
[25:52.71]May's accident was in a fire.
[25:56.09]just don't want her getting upset with unnecessary questions about things long over they're doing the like I understand their arms you can read all about judge when you come to the museum later alright so turn on faucet first thing I'm gonna try you jerk deegan said you've been in town for days but you haven't come by
[26:19.39]I know, I know, I know.
[26:20.55]I had to check in with your case at the, uh... I feel like I'm watching somebody that made a machinima in The Sims.
[26:26.70]How are you holding up?
[26:28.74]And it was not, it was like an experiment that we were going to try to see if they could get a camera in the house.
[26:33.82]Hey, at least I got you to get off your butt and finally visit me.
[26:37.71]Um... Oh, this is the girl I was telling you about.

[29:43.93]Uh, okay.
[29:44.43]Um... Real photos of actual people.
[30:12.92]I always find these interesting because who are these people?
[30:18.62]They're like devs or like cousins of devs or nephews or friends or brothers, sisters, children, and it's always like, it's interesting.
[30:35.57]They're random people.
[30:37.19]Now that would be weird.
[30:40.58]Are there stock photos of, like, where a family, like, just in the backyard?
[30:43.66]Is there?
[30:44.26]I guess there has to be, right?
[30:49.40]There are a lot of them.
[30:51.48]Alright, I've got rust to be gone.
[30:59.28]Can I spray rust in the bed?
[31:02.16]I've got a draw right here.

[31:14.68]Nope.
[31:15.40]What's that?

[32:42.88]Here, look, I got a photo.
[32:50.27]Look at this.
[32:50.99]Are you ready to leave yet?
[32:52.13]We don't have all day.
[32:55.32]What were you actually doing?
[32:59.86]Don't tell Tegan that's your plan.
[33:02.20]It'll give us a good overview of the town.
[33:04.49]You mean I want to meet the real Witch of Salem?
[33:07.55]Yeah, I do.
[33:09.57]She might know something.
[33:10.73]I wonder why Tegan doesn't like her.
[33:13.77]You don't have to investigate everything, Drew.
[33:15.93]Rust spray her in the face.
[33:17.05]Olivia steals Tegan's visitors, sounds like.
[33:20.37]you really want to do this dumb tour you don't have to come with me side by side it does sound more fun than the museum
[33:32.22]Alright, how do I just leave the conversation?
[33:34.30]Why do I have to do every dialogue option?
[33:35.76]What were you actually doing before you picked me up from the airport?
[33:39.08]You gave Mae a non-answer when she asked why it took you so long to stop by here.
[33:42.34]Because they're all working together.
[33:43.60]A non-answer?
[33:44.44]Yeah.
[33:45.22]You were at your witch meeting.
[33:46.26]Because I went to the police station.
[33:48.76]And?
[33:48.98]And.
[33:49.78]And I'm so oblivious.
[33:50.52]They're still going through the evidence.
[33:51.88]That you could all be witches around me.
[33:53.68]And when it turned out I was Mae's cousin, they started.
[33:55.76]And I'm busy looking around for weirdly shaped fucking keys.
[33:58.80]They think she did it.
[34:00.54]Everyone does.
[34:02.26]So, I went to check out the Hathorn house myself.
[34:06.49]But I never went inside.
[34:07.57]The ghost?
[34:09.21]What?
[34:10.79]No.
[34:11.73]There was some weirdo there who told me the ghost was going to steal my soul.
[34:17.32]It was totally creepy.
[34:18.72]And then I found out that everyone in this town believes in ghosts, so I...
[34:23.84]They're doing like a demonic seance behind me.
[34:26.18]I'm looking around finding interestingly painted eggs.
[34:27.60]Ooh, an egg.
[34:28.08]Yeah, let's go.
[34:28.54]Somebody... Maybe.
[34:28.96]I don't know.
[34:51.81]Alright, let's go.
[34:55.23]What do you think about this?
[35:01.02]What do you think about this?
[35:08.68]Nothing.
[35:11.50]Talk to Tegan in the museum.
[35:13.58]Talk to Judge Danforth.
[35:17.53]Who's Ned?
[35:22.74]Hello.
[35:24.56]You've reached the voicemail inbox of Ned Nickerson.
[35:27.40]I apologize that I did not come to the phone in a timely fashion.
[35:30.76]Please feel free to leave a message after the beep.
[35:36.30]Um... And then I'm going to really piss that person off because they have a new voicemail now.
[35:44.67]And it's going to be nothing there.
[35:45.85]Alright.
[35:47.59]Um...

[37:03.98]Everything's great.
[37:04.66]I'm seeing this through.
[37:07.24]There is something going on and I have to figure out what.
[37:09.64]Okay.

[37:41.37]I just called you.
[37:42.73]Well, not good, apparently.
[37:44.68]My pupils are fucking completely dilated.
[37:46.98]I can't see anything.
[37:57.08]What?
[37:57.52]What?
[37:57.74]What is going on?
[37:59.58]Is that... Are we together?
[38:30.33]Is that my boyfriend?
[38:32.07]That's my boyfriend.
[38:34.01]So... I'm gonna look for... Wait, look in the mailbox.
[38:44.43]Jesus Christ, don't...
[38:50.85]Don't sneak up on me like that!
[38:52.07]I don't want to call again.
[38:53.05]I wish I could text.
[38:53.79]Alright, put the phone down.
[39:29.41]What about that car?
[39:31.60]It's a broken window!
[39:32.28]No, it's not.
[39:32.72]Alright, let's go.
[39:35.86]Her eyes have madness to them.
[39:40.44]It says, Google Street View.
[39:50.37]Google Street View.
[39:55.47]By now, you know the story of the witches of Salem those I've been here is exactly what it looks like And they paid the price they may have died but witchcraft lives on Oh This should be interesting The world would have you believe witches were not real
[40:19.14]I'm not talking about old, ugly women who curse their neighbors and fly on broomsticks.
[40:25.44]What's going on with the protestors?
[40:27.80]Witches are real.
[40:29.58]What's going on?
[40:30.16]They have always been real.
[40:32.77]They are alive and well.
[40:34.93]They are powerful.
[40:35.93]Witch protestors?
[40:36.91]Carrying the secrets of the world beyond the one we see.
[40:41.57]Ritual, mystery, magic.
[40:46.13]Most exist now only in scenes.
[40:49.60]And they may be standing among you even now.
[40:55.23]It is said that in Salem, a coven of witches settled in recent years.
[41:01.38]Set on revenge for the deaths of the Salem witches.
[41:05.56]Their ritual, one midnight on Halloween, unleashed the angry spirits of the past.
[41:13.17]Is my mouth just open?
[41:15.07]Wait a minute, that's you!
[41:17.99]Thank you.
[41:18.93]I feel like my mouth is open and saliva is going down.
[41:20.57]Same animation too.
[41:33.16]I think in Austria use the same kind of stage magic she's using thief there was a thief what were you doing there visiting a spooky old castle driving all the way sometimes Boston and if you want a long trip but I'm you know trying to make my friends happy come forward
[42:05.76]I have here a photo of witchcraft in practice.
[42:13.23]And all of you here are gonna see the truth.
[42:16.34]Nevermind.
[42:26.89]Did you know that in the Malleus Maleficarum, ginger hair was the sign of a witch?
[42:38.36]That's not into it.
[42:47.07]Actually, I think he thinks she's talking to him.
[42:49.46]You truly are a witch.
[42:51.42]So to become a witch, do I need to take a test or get a diploma?
[42:55.68]A true witch is not made with pieces of paper.
[42:59.97]She is born to it and will feel the call.
[43:02.97]A true witch is just a study.
[43:06.63]We don't need permission.
[43:08.85]We don't live by the rules.
[43:13.13]Anyway, what can I help you with?
[43:14.99]No, he's stuck in a situation that I think a lot of us have been in previously before.
[43:20.02]If there's a conversation happening through you, there's not much you can really do.
[43:29.58]You could, I guess, one step to the left.
[43:33.60]But if this guy turns and looks over here and realizes that he's not even remotely part of this conversation, then it's weird.
[43:40.90]But if... You know, take out the phone.
[43:44.73]Hit a few buttons.
[43:47.13]Pretend to be on a phone call with somebody.
[43:49.35]That's how you get out of this.
[43:50.67]Otherwise, you'd like this guy.
[43:51.71]I think he has his phone on him.
[43:52.48]He's stuck here.
[43:53.16]He is stuck here until we're done having a conversation.
[43:59.87]How often do you do this show?
[44:02.11]Most nights.
[44:03.39]It gets busier around Halloween.
[44:05.37]And I'm sure you can figure out why.
[44:08.11]How about the night that the Hathorne house was burned?
[44:11.85]You look a little young to be working for the police.
[44:15.01]Don't I do puzzle games?
[44:16.11]Don't I do puzzles?
[44:17.15]It's nothing like that.
[44:18.23]We're just curious jurists.
[44:20.08]I pressed my grandfather's porn briefcase button.
[44:23.18]And we've talked about Salem.
[44:25.02]And so you were here.
[44:27.26]I was out of town.
[44:28.96]Did you girls know that Salem is haunted?
[44:32.34]There's a ghost here.
[44:34.92]If you go on my tour, you'll learn where you can find it.
[44:37.26]Get that candle.
[44:40.43]Okay.
[44:42.49]Bye.
[44:42.75]Talk to you later.
[44:43.45]We'll be back.
[44:44.31]I got a message.
[44:46.93]Hey, Nancy.
[44:47.71]Deidre gave me your number.
[44:49.81]Sorry about before.
[44:50.59]I was stressed.
[44:53.56]Don't worry about it.
[44:54.28]And thanks for... Alright, let me get the fuck out of here.
[44:56.36]Take two steps to the right.
[44:57.22]They have the conversation now.
[44:59.93]Thanks for getting in contact.
[45:01.17]Where can I find the museum?
[45:03.89]Oh, you're so welcome to come by.
[45:05.41]We're on the opposite side of the town square.
[45:07.41]I... We're on the opposite side of the town square from the courthouse.
[45:16.44]Just turn right and go past the old cemetery.
[45:18.60]You can't miss it.
[45:19.46]Great.
[45:21.98]That fucking battery, though.
[45:25.10]Come on.
[45:27.06]I want to find out... You get the idea.
[45:31.29]Am I reading their thoughts?
[45:33.17]Am I inside of, like, this is what they're texting together?
[46:01.19]Alright, alright, let's, uh, alright.
[46:08.71]Move.
[46:09.05]Road closed.
[46:10.59]Because there is a... There's a sinkhole.
[46:14.33]I don't remember there being, like, ridiculous earthquakes in Massachusetts.
[46:18.93]This giant sinkhole?
[46:21.51]Uh-oh.
[46:24.75]Here's the courthouse.
[46:32.13]What'd he say?
[46:39.26]False judgment.
[46:40.30]False claim.
[46:42.22]What do we want?
[46:51.27]Justice.
[46:51.77]When do we want it?
[46:52.53]Now.
[47:01.43]Now.
[47:08.52]Okay, that's, what am I doing in the courthouse?
[47:12.54]Talk to Judge Danforth.
[47:13.98]Okay, you got it.
[47:17.37]Hey, what are you doing?
[47:19.11]What?
[47:19.77]He's a judge, Deirdre.
[47:21.43]He's not gonna bite.
[47:22.69]Hello?
[47:23.89]Judge Danforth.
[47:25.03]Yeah, hello.
[47:28.13]Is that you?
[47:28.78]This is the restroom.
[47:31.98]My office is down the hall to the left.
[47:34.76]Uh, give me a minute.
[47:36.48]Nancy Drew?
[47:38.58]Carson's daughter?
[47:39.52]Why do we talk- is this a priest?
[47:42.22]Why do we talk through the door?
[47:43.89]No, you can't come in the bathroom with me.
[47:46.79]What the fuck are you talking about?
[48:01.24]But if you could give me some toilet paper.
[48:04.62]There's not enough left.
[48:05.66]There's just enough to make it not be gross.
[48:08.52]But I really don't want to walk down the hall.
[48:11.76]So if you could grab me a new roll, that'd be fantastic.
[48:15.89]Do you know where I could find a key to your office?
[48:19.05]Yes, I believe I gave a copy of the key to Alicia Cole as backup.
[48:23.31]She's just down the hall.
[48:24.69]I hope she's still here.
[48:33.67]So wait, this guy locked himself in his office.
[48:38.72]From the inside.
[48:39.76]Is that what we're led to believe here?
[48:44.50]That's not even possible.
[48:50.91]You can't do that.
[48:52.03]Unless you glued the door shut.
[49:02.21]I can't go in these rooms.
[49:07.65]Ah, yes, you see, I accidentally glued the whole seam of the door and held it in place for three hours.
[49:15.64]Yes, can I help you?
[49:17.52]Hi, so sorry to bother you at this hour, but we're here to meet with Judge Danforth, and he seems to be locked inside his office.
[49:26.24]He said you might have a key.
[49:29.27]Sorry, I gave him my spare.
[49:31.86]What?
[49:32.32]Um, he has a key and he's on the inside and we're gonna pick the lock to his door when he's inside the door.
[49:45.26]Helping the judge with a case.
[49:47.08]Anything I can assist you with?
[49:48.88]Thanks, but I think we got it.
[49:51.00]No need for a lawyer.
[49:52.48]At least, not yet.
[49:54.06]The diploma gave me away, huh?
[49:56.39]Aside from the cold coffee you're still drinking and the deluxe open box of sticky tabs, yeah.
[50:01.75]You could say I know the type really well.
[50:04.09]Nancy Drew, you really are your father's daughter.
[50:07.85]It's nice to finally meet you.
[50:10.37]You know my dad?
[50:11.48]Small world.
[50:12.70]If you need any assistance or more paperclips, feel free to ask.
[50:21.38]Alright, let's go pick the judge's luck.
[50:29.46]Paperclip.
[50:30.60]Judge Danforth?
[50:32.67]I couldn't find your key.
[50:34.55]What?
[50:35.47]Alicia said she'd keep a copy for me.
[50:38.37]Well, I did find a paperclip.
[50:41.19]I think I can pick your lock, if that's okay with you.
[50:45.19]Yeah, sure, fine.
[50:49.53]Oh no, wait, I have to actually pick the lock?
[50:52.45]Just open the fucking door, Judge.
[50:55.89]Open the door!
[51:00.51]Just grab it and turn it.
[51:02.99]Alright, hold to drag pin.
[51:05.71]Feel for the pin that gives resistance.
[51:07.81]Release... Hold to drag pin.
[51:19.80]Feel for... Release when the pin locks in place.
[51:22.62]Don't you go like...
[51:43.11]It's this one.
[51:47.95]I had it.
[51:49.15]No.
[51:50.31]This one.
[51:51.29]Got it.
[52:11.88]Of course.
[52:12.12]Well, what the fuck are you talking about?
[52:14.52]What does that even mean?
[52:15.12]The game just crashed.
[52:45.50]No, we just got into the judge's door!
[53:00.77]Got arrested.
[53:03.71]Alright, hold on.
[53:05.05]That- did it- does this game save?
[53:06.99]Does this game actually save?
[53:19.29]Stop right there, criminal scum.
[53:30.12]Will we ever learn?
[53:32.48]Will we ever learn?
[53:35.24]There's been decades of video game development.
[53:38.86]Decades.
[53:40.40]Decades of this shit.
[53:42.34]And you're telling me that in decades of development,
[53:47.99]We're still, everybody, and this is from like single A all the way up to the major leagues in video game development.
[53:57.15]Why do you have your splash screens at maximum goddamn volume?
[54:04.92]Why?
[54:06.24]It's like, do you not open your game?
[54:09.10]Do you not open the game?
[54:10.88]You have to open the game like a thousand times in the debug menus.
[54:14.06]Open your game before you give it to people.
[54:20.56]How many times have we opened a video game and it's like, okay, let's open this video game.
[54:26.22]Ow!
[54:28.26]Like, that happens so often.
[54:30.77]It's like, how does that keep happening?
[54:41.39]Suffer me now!
[54:43.27]Why'd you say that?
[54:46.56]Oh, we got in.
[55:05.08]Posture.
[55:06.81]That's posture.
[55:10.99]You're doing that on purpose.
[55:13.17]You're doing it on purpose.
[55:15.58]Is this money?
[55:21.02]Those protesters are out there again.
[55:24.02]Stirring the pot.
[55:26.37]You know, this town used to be a quiet place.
[55:29.03]Seems lately there's been an element of this infiltrated community.
[55:33.67]And now one of those troublemakers locked my door and threw away the key.
[55:39.10]Now, Nancy.
[55:40.70]Your father and I have discussed.
[55:43.28]Oh, sorry.
[55:44.40]I'm not Nancy.
[55:46.04]Of course you're not.
[55:46.76]You look nothing like Carson.
[55:48.83]Did your father ever tell you about the time we won fourth place at the Lake Winnipesaukee Regatta?
[55:54.66]No, but you told me how you locked yourself in an office and had to have a, like, 17-year-old open your door with a lockpick.
[56:03.22]She's working with me on the case.
[56:04.86]I don't know how old am I. You're the one who tried to break down my door.
[56:09.34]Break down?
[56:10.51]Your Honor, that's an exaggeration.
[56:13.57]I was knocking.
[56:15.51]Heavily.
[56:16.96]Break down the door.
[56:28.21]Well, we just used our free time to unlock your door.
[56:32.77]So I'm sure you'll be willing to repay us with some answers to our questions.
[56:36.07]Don't look in the corner.
[56:37.49]Yeah, how long have you been locked in here?
[56:39.13]Yes, of course.
[56:39.97]What can I help you girls with?
[56:42.19]Yeah, pay no attention to the six bags of Uber Eats that are over here.
[56:47.47]I was having the delivery drivers football throw them through the window.
[56:50.74]Sorry.
[56:53.50]Sorry.
[56:56.69]How are you involved?
[56:57.93]I was told that the burning of Hathorne House is suspected.
[57:02.50]I was told that the burning of Hathorne House is suspected to be a case of arson.
[57:07.64]How did the police come to that conclusion?
[57:10.08]The investigation found paint solvent residue on burnt embers, suggesting someone deliberately used an accelerant.
[57:18.97]Thankfully, Mrs. Tuttle never had to see what became of her home.
[57:23.26]And what evidence do you have that Mae Perry is the one responsible for this?
[57:27.59]Evidence?
[57:28.97]Have you ever heard of recidivism?
[57:31.65]Three out of four criminals in the United States are repeat offenders.
[57:35.54]And there's only one person in all of Salem who has a history of fire-related crime.
[57:41.60]So, there is no evidence.
[57:43.88]Not yet, but there will be.
[57:46.58]You don't need evidence.
[57:48.30]She's already been convicted in the court of public opinion.
[57:51.90]Is that what she said?
[57:54.00]No, I'm saying... She has a history with this sort of thing.
[57:59.28]What's May's motive?
[58:00.74]What does she gain by burning down the Hawthorne house?
[58:03.68]You'd have to ask her.
[58:05.00]And while you're at it, you can ask about her alibi, which she refused to give to the police.
[58:10.86]So, any other questions?
[58:15.74]Can you explain to us how you're involved with the Hathorne House?
[58:19.51]Well, yes.
[58:21.19]The house was built by Judge John Hathorne during the 1600s.
[58:25.79]And it represented the oldest surviving structure in the era.
[58:30.03]Judge Hathorne, of course, was one of the three judges that presided over the Salem Witch Trials.
[58:35.61]Yes, and I'm sure we can read all about the home's history in Salem's museum.
[58:40.03]Now leave me be.
[58:41.33]More recently, Francis Tubbell, Judge Hathorne's last direct descendant, lived in a small section of the house while the rest was left to hold a considerable distribution of air.
[58:51.48]She was a successful part-time caregiver, Lauren Holt, who had a bedroom in the carriage house.
[59:00.65]A few months ago, Francis Tuttle passed away, which left Hathorne House without a legal heir.
[59:07.98]According to the historical statutes of Salem, after 90 days, the house reverts to public property, the deadline of which is two days from now, at midnight.
[59:22.03]Okay.
[59:22.93]So the Book of Apologies, why did you need it?
[59:25.19]So the Book of Apologies...
[59:27.70]Why did you really need it?
[59:29.54]Yes, and first of all, I'm so glad you're alright.
[59:32.88]Nasty business.
[59:34.51]Had I known you were going to be put in harm's way, I would have never called Carson and asked for his help.
[59:39.33]I've done plenty of work for my father.
[59:42.61]Trust me, I can handle myself.
[59:45.60]Yes, I'm sure you can.
[59:49.20]So, I've already heard some stories, but would you mind giving me your version of why the book is important?
[59:55.30]Yes.
[59:56.20]So, Judge Sewell was rumored to keep a ledger of all the accused, intending to publish it to reconcile with their families and clear their names.
[60:06.81]But he passed away before he could do so.
[60:09.60]Going to Austria for a rumored book seems like a heck of a long shot.
[60:14.77]Who are you again?
[60:16.38]I have been under some pressure from the A.W.
[60:18.50]group.
[60:19.54]A.W.
[60:20.12]as in Accused Witches.
[60:21.92]Alright, well... Talk to you later.
[60:28.86]Don't get locked in your office again.
[60:29.84]Before you go, there is something else I need your help with.
[60:35.31]You're not locked out of your car, are you?
[60:37.23]Please say yes.
[60:37.95]Oh, no.
[60:39.79]There was a...
[60:41.48]there was an incident here recently someone broke into the evidence room oh have you called the police well no not yet I don't think anything was taken never mind I'll I'll call the police thank you for your time evidence room let's go get a photo of him too
[61:10.78]Where's the evidence room?
[61:12.18]Evidence room.
[61:12.90]This way.
[61:16.70]How do I get in the evidence room?
[61:21.90]Scan the photo.
[61:25.24]Rust.
[61:26.52]It's a rusty door.
[61:28.68]Use the weird key.
[61:30.66]Uh oh.
[61:32.57]Take out the camera.
[61:37.67]Hey, can I go in the evidence room?
[61:38.61]Right.
[61:38.85]Come back tomorrow?
[61:40.26]I have to go back?
[61:41.36]What do you mean, come back tomorrow?
[61:43.60]Is there a day-night cycle in this game?
[61:44.96]Alright, fine, whatever.
[61:45.58]Alright, let's go.
[62:06.72]Welcome back in the office.
[62:16.09]Why are there protesters in a small town like this?
[62:21.55]What was that?
[62:24.81]What was that?
[62:32.21]Why are there protesters in a small town like this?
[62:39.40]That was recorded... That's not an outside voice.
[62:46.52]Skyrim mod voice acting.
[62:48.63]I don't even know what that means, but it's funny.
[62:52.37]I'm just joking.
[63:02.22]Xbox Mike Xbox Mike oh stop you're gonna you guys are gonna hurt me let's visit the cemetery I want a picture of little liberty what alright let's go it'll be more useful to explore the graveyard with a tour guide it'll be more useful to explore no the game's fresh
[63:31.49]I think I'm gonna go this way.
[63:33.17]What is this?
[63:36.51]Is this a bar?
[63:37.21]We're going to the bar.
[63:39.13]Wait, can we not go- are we not allowed to go to the bar?
[63:41.57]Alright, the bar.
[63:47.23]Wait, how old are we?
[63:52.37]Get away from me!
[63:53.44]You're just in the way!
[63:56.32]Look at how much- okay.
[63:57.82]If I move this way, for instance, right?
[63:59.54]I'm going this way.
[64:01.35]Now I'm going to turn this way.
[64:03.11]She takes up so much screen real estate.
[64:04.81]Just like, put her over here.
[64:07.59]Have her be like the Microsoft paperclip that I can click on.
[64:19.66]Street art in Salem.
[64:20.82]Coming soon.
[64:26.26]What's this?
[64:29.61]Remembering the wrongly accused may history never again be repeated.
[64:41.20]Nothing.
[64:43.70]Nothing.
[64:44.36]Okay, hold to look.
[64:47.64]Something else?
[64:48.18]There's probably like a little tab I can push.
[64:51.16]The figure of a Puritan woman accused of being a witch.
[64:54.92]These were ordinary people, just like anyone else.
[64:58.18]Yeah, all of a sudden, I'm going to lean in, it's going to be like, they're going to scream, it's going to be an actor that's doing the I'm the statue thing.
[65:05.61]I'm getting unsuspecting people.
[65:08.75]The figure of... Alright, move forward.
[65:12.59]No, you're in the way.
[65:13.35]Get out of the way, I want to talk to you.
[65:16.61]Shh, wait.
[65:27.29]Alright, I'm back.
[65:27.99]I'm here.
[65:28.47]Everyone's got these fucking candles.
[65:31.00]No we didn't.
[65:31.74]It's a lie.
[65:48.11]Everyone has to make a living.
[65:49.99]Is she telling the story about a coven living here in the recent past?
[65:53.71]Yeah.
[65:54.55]Yeah.
[65:55.43]Why?
[65:56.49]Just bad taste.
[65:58.51]Olivia is quite the local character.
[66:01.41]I hope you don't mind if we do the tour.
[66:03.77]I want to see more of the town.
[66:05.67]And finding out a place's old superstitions is kind of a habit I've gotten into.
[66:11.48]I'm excited to look around the museum.
[66:13.60]Of course.
[66:15.27]We got a ticket.
[66:15.95]Wait a minute.
[66:17.25]Wait a minute.
[66:17.67]Is this the... Oh, it's a raffle ticket.
[66:25.77]Why can I not show this photo to you?
[66:33.56]Aren't you in this photo?
[66:37.86]Go on the witch tour.
[66:41.70]Admissions. $25?! !
[66:45.92]This better be good.
[66:46.38]Stray book.
[66:46.84]You see it.
[66:47.08]I do.
[66:47.20]Told you.
[66:48.62]Uh... Somebody will end up reading this somehow.
[67:15.95]What about this one?
[67:16.37]Okay, what about this one?
[67:17.13]Anything else?
[67:17.67]Turn page.
[67:18.17]Wait, somebody will read this.
[67:19.09]Any codes?
[67:19.59]Alright, cool.
[67:46.73]Cool.
[67:47.33]Alright, so let's go on the tour.
[67:53.47]And this is gonna happen.
[67:56.62]This is the intro of the game.
[67:58.26]We're gonna go on the tour.
[67:59.10]Something bad's gonna happen.
[68:00.84]There's gonna be a... There's gonna be a... A fight's gonna break out and we're gonna have to... There's gonna be a ghost that attacks us.
[68:07.42]I know.
[68:07.74]I've seen it already.
[68:17.44]That's the guy that was stuck in the conversation, and he's still stuck, and he's still pretending that he... Oh, no, no, never mind.
[68:23.34]That tree with arms just proved us wrong.
[68:25.14]Never mind.
[68:28.82]Let's go on the tour.
[68:35.80]I have a ticket!
[68:36.85]This tour sounds interesting.
[68:39.03]Welcome on my tour.
[68:40.61]Thank you.
[68:41.37]Welcome on my tour.
[68:42.75]Found a tablet.
[68:45.59]Is it which... What?
[68:49.64]They give you an iPad?
[68:52.60]Look for the Raven and place the tablet over the spots of interest.
[69:01.94]Okay.
[69:03.58]Look for me.
[69:07.55]So this is not a tour.
[69:09.73]This is an app.
[69:10.49]Uh-oh.
[69:12.03]Here comes trouble.
[69:15.65]How'd you do that trick?
[69:16.29]Magician.
[69:16.51]Magician code.
[69:16.99]That's why that guy wore the mask when he did all the reveal secrets on that TV show.
[69:21.13]Remember that show?
[69:21.91]Remember the guy that showed all the magic secrets?
[69:41.31]And he was in that full head mask, because he didn't want anyone to know who he was.
[69:47.23]Like, it was somehow dangerous for him to not have that mask on.
[69:53.74]That's what was sort of implied, like, he needs to wear this mask, otherwise the fucking magicians are coming for him.
[70:07.92]That show was fucking pretty good, actually.
[70:10.62]Alright, look for the birds.
[70:15.58]What do I have with this?
[70:20.58]Bring light into the darkness.
[70:23.58]Put your iPad on it.
[70:29.49]Before you stands Abigail Hathorne, helping the accused witches escape the grasp of her own brother, Judge Hathorne.
[70:37.01]It's a very high-tech statue for something that was made 100 years ago.
[70:40.88]Until the judge caught her in the act and locked her up in a cell deep within the Hathorne house.
[70:46.10]The statue was given the name Little Liberty in honor of her valiant efforts to free the innocent.
[70:57.73]I'm just doing what y'all, this is real life.
[71:01.33]Okay, uh, cool.
[71:02.85]So I got one.
[71:07.70]The big tree?
[71:12.50]No smoking.
[71:13.18]Wait.
[71:13.32]Scan the raven.
[71:21.36]Let's keep going.
[71:49.88]This is when you start to realize that, like, oh man, was this, like... I didn't... I thought it... No, not anymore.
[71:56.57]Not anymore.
[71:58.59]They do, like, haunted houses and shit here now.
[72:00.17]When does this game take place?
[72:10.96]Today.
[72:11.30]Ow!
[72:20.03]It's just like an iPad, like a little iPad burn mark.
[72:23.53]Just like... This thing is fucking hot.
[72:31.04]I can't fucking hold it.
[72:32.46]You guys have a... Okay, I'm gonna tell you, I'm an iPad.
[72:42.67]I'm a master of the iPad.
[72:45.33]But this is a real story, and you guys are gonna know if you also have iPads.
[72:50.57]Some apps actually hurt to use because they make the iPad so hot that it's hard to even hold it after a while.
[72:59.65]Can't use that.
[73:03.83]What I'm saying is not... This is not... Oh, well, that's funny.
[73:06.47]Like, he's... Sometimes I use my iPad and I use, like, a game that's really high graphic integrity, and the thing hurts to hold.
[73:13.69]It's just like, fuck this all.
[73:15.45]So...
[73:23.34]Alright, can I just, we're just gonna go around and do this so I can get my drink ticket for later?
[73:28.22]This is what you have to do.
[73:30.74]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.
[73:31.74]We did the thing.
[73:32.62]We did the tour.
[73:33.36]We did the thing.
[73:38.32]Alright, what else next?
[73:41.96]Where's my checklist?
[73:45.54]Oh, the sinkhole.
[73:46.58]The Puritan statue.
[73:47.60]Didn't I get that one?
[74:01.78]A-W.
[74:02.88]A-W.
[74:04.58]Yeah?
[74:04.98]No, get the fuck out of the way.
[74:08.65]A-W.
[74:10.17]A-W.
[74:10.73]Kidding me?
[74:12.91]This is the same marking as in Mosam Castle.
[74:16.33]What a strange coincidence.
[74:20.33]Nancy, you've been solving mysteries for like 30 years.
[74:24.18]In your line of work, there's no such thing as a coincidence.
[74:27.81]You're still doing, like, the, oh, gee golly, what a coincidence bit.
[74:31.96]Alright, what, what, what am I going?
[74:37.70]Over here?
[74:41.26]Nancy, dot, dot, dot.
[74:43.88]Can't use that here.
[74:44.96]What do I need to find?
[74:45.86]No, don't scan the iPad.
[74:50.88]Accused witches sink holes in a statue.
[74:56.38]Where's the sinkhole?
[74:57.38]Isn't that the accused witch's?
[74:59.14]Wait, that's the sinkhole over there, isn't it?
[75:09.01]No, that's the house.
[75:09.77]Where's the sinkhole?
[75:17.41]The soundtrack is so loud.
[75:18.96]Is it?
[75:28.17]Where's the scanner for this one?
[75:34.69]I already got this one, didn't I?
[75:40.49]How did I not do this one?
[75:46.99]Judge Hathorne's grave?
[75:48.61]Isn't that the guy I just talked to up there?
[75:51.76]Wait, I have to... Get away from me.
[75:56.28]Get away from me.
[75:58.36]You don't have to get... They're not all in here.
[76:05.99]I have to go take a picture of the famous sinkhole.
[76:09.81]Alright, the statue.
[76:23.83]There's a Puritan statue here somewhere.
[76:26.73]There it is.
[76:29.22]What an awful tour.
[76:34.14]What do you mean, I can't use that here?
[76:38.85]Yes, I can.
[76:40.01]Why not?
[76:40.47]Really?
[76:54.20]The iPad's too hot.
[76:55.12]It needs to cool down.
[76:59.37]Get away from me.
[77:02.37]Witch's memorial and Puritan statue.
[77:09.65]Where the hell is that?
[77:15.16]How is that not a Puritan statue?
[77:21.18]In the museum?
[77:26.45]Talk to the bathroom voice again.
[77:29.13]Oh, there it is.
[77:29.77]Yeah.
[77:31.97]Okay.
[77:35.08]Accused Witches Memorial.
[77:39.70]The figure of a Puritan woman accused of
[77:46.67]Don't skip.
[77:47.69]But... Okay, here's why I'm skipping.
[77:50.89]All the info that you are getting right now is an info dump.
[77:53.48]It's a history lesson.
[77:55.68]If you just typed in right now... I'm just saving us some stream time.
[77:59.66]If you typed in right now, Salem Witch Trials, and then went to Wikipedia, you'd get all this info, and you could do it whenever you... It's just an info dump.
[78:09.95]We don't need to know all this to understand that, like, the judge that we just talked to is gonna... We're gonna pull a mask off of him in, like, 25 minutes and it's gonna be him.
[78:20.75]We don't need that info.
[78:25.36]We don't, though.
[78:25.88]We really don't.
[78:27.44]Where's this last one?
[78:29.18]Accused witches with war.
[78:30.42]Where would that be?
[78:38.44]It's a mystery game.
[78:41.49]Let the ravens be your guide.
[78:43.04]Yeah, the ravens are just on the... Back in the, uh... Cemetery?
[78:53.16]Jesus, one guy told you to play this.
[79:01.21]Yeah.
[79:03.33]Zero.
[79:03.59]I already did that!
[79:17.20]I like this game.
[79:18.48]I'm into it.
[79:20.54]Back in the museum.
[79:21.23]It's in the museum.
[79:23.29]Hey, I'm into it until I'm not, right?
[79:30.65]That's how it works.
[79:31.87]Oh, this is like... I thought... Okay.
[79:34.01]Yeah.
[79:34.29]Okay.
[79:48.04]Okay, talk to Mae again.
[79:50.68]Now we can go back to the story.
[79:52.86]I'm back.
[79:54.18]I did your... there's... there's the statue in the cemetery.
[80:13.64]There's this statue in the cemetery.
[80:15.84]Little Liberty.
[80:16.92]A highlight of my tour.
[80:19.36]Many people come here just to get a picture of it.
[80:22.24]It is said to portray Abigail Hathorne helping the accused witches escape the trials.
[80:28.88]Some even believe that Abigail's ghost still walks the forest surrounding the Hathorne house, her twisted soul now dragging the living into the afterlife.
[80:42.52]Alright, I'll talk to you later.
[80:45.50]Talk with me again.
[80:48.28]you really believe some modern witch coven unleashed do you really believe some modern about eight years back there were rumors of a coven that they performed a ritual to return the dead which is to seek out their revenge is there any evidence of such a coven ever since then ghost sightings have gone through the roof Salem is now considered the most haunted place in the country
[81:13.39]And it better stay that way.
[81:15.86]Because otherwise I ain't selling iPad apps to tourists anymore.
[81:19.56]It's so haunted.
[81:21.02]Be careful!
[81:22.30]Everywhere you go there's ghosts everywhere.
[81:24.14]Please come back next year and do it again, the tour.
[81:28.48]There's only $25 to go see pumpkin carvings in here.
[81:35.68]Have you lived in Salem for long?
[81:37.86]Born and raised.
[81:40.01]So you know the Perrys?
[81:41.47]Of course.
[81:42.87]Not well.
[81:44.55]If you are looking for them, Tegan is at the- I know she's in here.
[81:49.05]We're staying with Tegan.
[81:50.82]I figured there was some history between you two.
[81:53.64]That was a long time back.
[81:56.02]We don't talk much now.
[81:58.54]That's like a- Yes, I know her too.
[82:00.24]Not spoken to her for a long time either.
[82:01.68]Just sort of slightly shit your pants.
[82:04.77]And you can't move.
[82:05.85]It's just a lip, just tiny.
[82:09.05]Just a little.
[82:11.07]Enough for you to be able to take care of it.
[82:13.17]And nothing bad's gonna happen.
[82:14.03]How else could that have started?
[82:14.89]Okay.
[82:31.83]The world is composed of two equal parts.
[82:35.07]Why did you pick the worst Nancy Drew game?
[82:36.85]This is the new one.
[82:37.69]This came out like two days ago.
[82:42.43]This is the new one.
[82:44.37]This is 2019.
[82:44.97]Two days ago, just released.
[82:46.63]Nancy Drew.
[82:47.83]This is brand new.
[82:48.57]The dark is the unknown.
[82:51.32]A plane of existence that vibrates just underneath the light.
[82:56.82]But if you were in a place like Salem, a place where a painful history permeates every surface, every crack, every brick... I bought all of them.
[83:05.14]There's a bundle where you can buy fucking all of them.
[83:08.36]I just compulsively bought them all, so it doesn't matter.
[83:11.56]We'll play them all.
[83:14.30]That's why they say, don't be out past midnight in Salem, because the dark may reach out and take you.
[83:23.11]Also, did you know that Salem has more ghost sightings than any other city in North America?
[83:28.00]Well?
[83:28.66]If you want to learn why, you should go on my tour.
[83:33.44]Talk to... Alright.
[83:35.72]Talk to Mae again.
[83:36.96]That's not Mae.
[83:40.12]Which one?
[83:40.52]Who's Mae?
[83:42.66]Who's Mae?
[83:45.75]Oh, in the office.
[83:50.47]Why are they...
[83:56.53]That group is really chanting up a storm.
[83:59.45]What has them so angry?
[84:01.35]Why do you ask?
[84:03.38]That group is... I wonder why these people are here.
[84:07.52]Can these guys get any louder?
[84:09.22]They're going to wake the dead next door.
[84:12.80]Maybe that's a good thing.
[84:14.72]I could ask them a few questions.
[84:17.79]Give us back what's ours!
[84:19.29]Wait.
[84:19.85]What do we want?
[84:21.03]Oh, excuse me.
[84:22.11]What exactly are you doing here?
[84:23.93]Excuse me.
[84:25.43]What exactly are you guys protesting?
[84:28.17]Only the greatest injustice that happened in Salem since 1692.
[84:31.17]They're going to give the house to the state justice.
[84:35.42]What happened?
[84:36.94]They're going to give the house to the state?
[84:39.74]A.W.
[84:45.28]Well, if you're doing it legally then why the protest march?
[85:01.90]Why are there protesters in a small town like this?
[85:32.43]I love that.
[85:33.01]I hope that actor shows up in a bunch of other places in this game.
[85:38.29]You know it's gonna happen.
[85:41.51]I can't wait.
[85:42.57]I'll come back later.
[85:43.99]Wait.
[85:45.85]Who's Mae?
[85:47.25]Can I call Mae?
[85:49.67]Sorry to break it to you, but I'm ghosting you.
[85:57.35]Try again later.
[85:59.07]Or don't.
[86:02.50]At least she's honest.
[86:06.84]She's a ghost.
[86:08.50]Yeah.
[86:12.04]Well, let's go back to the house then.
[86:15.74]Don't do it.
[86:19.56]Don't do it.
[86:20.80]Don't click on her and do it again!
[86:22.20]Don't do it again!
[86:23.29]Okay, let's go.
[86:40.95]alright been a long night let's go to sleep and get scary haunted first album was better yeah totally it's good really you like this why wouldn't I yeah well they were much better before they changed their basis
[86:59.28]Let's go over the evidence.
[87:00.72]That magic that Olivia was using is so similar to what I...
[87:21.98]That magic that Olivia was using is so similar to what I saw in Austria.
[87:29.24]I don't think the Witch of Salem is burning anything except people's hard-earned money.
[87:35.19]Those magic tricks are for kids.
[87:37.63]If Mae were willing to give an alibi, we could clear this up tonight.
[87:42.22]She's not talking to anyone, it seems.
[87:45.22]We are all allowed to enjoy some amount of privacy.
[87:48.35]But her refusal to be interviewed leads me to believe she is hiding something.
[87:52.62]I can't believe you, Drew.
[87:54.32]I thought you were here to help.
[87:58.98]You know, not everyone can be as brilliant and cold as you are.
[88:02.54]I'm not cold.
[88:05.10]And I never said I was brilliant either.
[88:07.18]You need to get made to trust you.
[88:09.92]If she trusts you, she'll open up and tell you the truth.
[88:13.87]And then you'll see.
[88:15.65]You're kind of my last hope to reach her.
[88:18.77]You're good at finding ways to get people to open up.
[88:22.13]Usually.
[88:23.29]So find a way.
[88:24.63]I'll try.
[88:28.53]The music from the car is still playing.
[88:32.22]Is it 10.15 in the morning or 10.15 at night?
[88:35.90]It's night time, right?
[88:37.30]Okay, this is late.
[88:46.08]Oh, we're gonna connect with the music.
[88:49.42]I liked the first album better.
[88:51.94]Hey, what are you listening to?
[88:53.66]I know that.
[88:54.29]Do you like this?
[88:55.29]Yeah.
[88:56.01]Yeah, we were listening on the way over.
[88:57.83]First album was much better.
[88:59.89]Yeah.
[89:01.41]Too bad they changed bassists.
[89:03.59]Yeah, too bad they changed bassists.
[89:06.31]Yeah, I know, right?
[89:07.99]It's just, you don't look like you listen to this music.
[89:11.50]Why does no one believe me?
[89:13.38]Now you know how I feel.
[89:16.93]Okay.
[89:22.07]I know you don't know me that well, but I'm here to... I know you don't know me that well, but I'm here to help you.
[89:29.17]I didn't burn down the Hathorne house.
[89:30.85]Okay.
[89:31.15]Why does everyone think you did?
[89:33.41]Can you turn down the loudspeaker?
[89:35.93]I look different.
[89:37.45]Or something like that.
[89:39.18]That doesn't seem like a good reason to burn down a building.
[89:42.68]What can I say?
[89:44.44]You're stupid.
[89:46.38]Look, I spoke with the judge.
[90:10.88]Look, I spoke with the judge.
[90:12.84]They don't have anything on me.
[90:15.02]All we need is an alibi, and then they can't charge you with anything.
[90:18.62]And they're not going to have anything on me, because he can't prove I did it.
[90:23.14]Then why not just give the police an alibi?
[90:25.64]That's all they need.
[90:26.90]I just can't.
[90:28.74]It's not really about me.
[90:31.64]Well... Okay, I understand.
[90:34.41]Can I take puzzles in this game?
[90:36.55]I thought you were supposed to pick up pieces and open drawers and escape rooms and unlock doors and stuff.
[90:57.02]Hey, you know your sister cares about you.
[90:58.38]Your sister really cares about you.
[90:59.82]They are, the old ones.
[91:00.84]She has strange ways of showing it sometimes.
[91:03.27]Well, she cared enough to get Deirdre and I involved.
[91:05.91]Don't worry about her.
[91:07.69]The scavenger hunt was a puzzle.
[91:08.99]She takes her work really seriously.
[91:11.11]Like, she cares.
[91:12.47]A lot.
[91:14.03]Like, way more than most normal people do for their passion projects.
[91:17.57]It's not a hobby.
[91:19.49]It's more like something she has to do.
[91:22.59]Kinda sounds like- Nope, not.
[91:25.27]It's like her personal crusade.
[91:26.91]Like, only she can make it better or something.
[91:28.71]You can't live your life like that.
[91:30.73]You need to enjoy it.
[91:33.13]Enjoy it with people you love.
[91:35.81]Yeah, believe me.
[91:37.43]I know.
[91:39.27]Alright, uh... Let me put it this way.
[91:41.89]I didn't... No, you can have it.
[91:44.53]I mean...
[91:46.58]Why don't you ask her?
[91:48.84]Okay.
[91:49.14]He's so loud.
[91:49.76]I'm done talking, okay?
[91:51.48]Alright, I got info.

[95:10.74]I'm just a customer.
[95:11.74]Who's Frank?
[95:15.74]That actually startled me.
[95:17.11]It did.
[95:21.57]Not creepy.
[95:22.55]Not at all.
[95:24.59]Alright, alright.
[95:25.65]Who's Frank?
[95:27.46]Nancy, you sound excited.
[95:31.02]Yeah, well, guess where I am right now.
[95:34.06]I, uh, wouldn't even begin to.
[95:36.72]Salem, Massachusetts.
[95:37.68]Outside, alone, and in the dark, in the rain, with no protection, nothing, not even a flashlight.
[95:43.23]And I'm by myself in a very scary spot.
[95:46.67]Not as a suspect, obviously.
[95:49.69]Tegan Perry mentioned she had hired you to investigate.
[95:53.28]Hired?
[95:54.38]Huh.
[95:55.37]That's news to me.
[95:56.73]I came here as a favor for Deirdre.
[95:58.65]Deirdre Shannon?
[96:00.15]Wow, that's surprising.
[96:02.37]Yeah, it's a strange case.
[96:05.70]Uh, are you in Boston?
[96:08.08]Are you guys in Boston?
[96:09.54]How'd you know?
[96:10.08]You said Flo.
[96:12.86]Why did I say Joe?
[96:14.46]Whoa, nothing gets past you.
[96:17.71]You must keep Ned on his toes.
[96:19.88]I thought this was Frank.
[96:20.62]Well, to be honest, I haven't really talked to him lately.
[96:23.92]Oh, really?
[96:25.32]What?
[96:26.00]Yeah, us neither.
[96:28.12]Salem's pretty close to Boston.
[96:29.76]Is this a split personality?
[96:30.86]If you guys have the time, you should come up here and check it out while I'm in town.
[96:34.38]Really?
[96:34.70]Yeah, it would be good to catch up.
[96:38.36]Eh, I don't know, Nancy.
[96:39.56]With our special detective powers, we might be mistaken for witches.
[96:42.74]Heard they don't fare well up there.
[96:43.98]Are you kidding me?
[96:45.42]They love you guys.
[96:48.03]It's two people, but it could be different.
[96:51.11]I'm in Salem.
[96:51.93]You don't make a bet with a person that's standing in the town.
[96:56.19]Why would you take that bet?
[96:57.76]What a terrible bet to place.
[97:23.53]Don't look behind you.
[97:30.69]The ghost will steal your soul.
[97:34.61]Oh.
[97:35.93]Ha ha ha, I got ya.
[97:37.09]Did you find anything?
[97:38.99]Mei isn't talking.
[97:42.23]Did you say something to her?
[97:46.44]No.
[97:48.16]Nothing in particular.
[97:49.16]Of course you're giving me the chills.
[97:53.47]I can't believe you're actually going out there.
[97:57.25]And if you see a ghost... Don't let it take your soul.
[98:04.87]Okay.
[98:13.15]Thanks for the wasted data.
[98:15.29]You know that I'm roaming in Salem.
[98:19.23]You fucking asshole.
[98:29.26]I almost just pressed F5 to quicksave it.
[98:31.14]I'm so used to pressing that button.
[98:37.35]There's someone in there.
[98:38.27]There's someone in that room.
[98:39.39]Let's go in and find out what's in there.
[98:53.34]Nancy, pick up a rock.
[98:55.14]It might be a little heavy, but with two hands you can cave in this person's face if they open the door and scream at you and try to kill you.
[99:00.87]What are you doing here?
[99:03.63]I would have just caved in somebody's face.
[99:05.69]You're trespassing.
[99:06.93]This is private property.
[99:09.61]I'm giving you one chance to explain yourself.
[99:15.07]Uh... I saw a light in the... I'm an investigator.
[99:18.61]I saw a light in the window.
[99:19.55]Enjoyment?
[99:20.17]No, I don't.
[99:20.69]I don't do that.
[99:43.78]Look, I don't have a... I don't have a camera.
[99:46.46]I don't have a camera on me.

[101:17.55]It looks like... We're gonna get... Here we go.
[101:35.73]Whoever is doing this, you're not frightening me away.
[101:38.59]Not possible.
[101:42.79]That's not possible.
[101:46.73]Curse not darkness.

[103:03.75]What?
[103:04.07]Wasn't I like... Didn't my eyes get all fucked up when I woke up here?
[103:07.94]What?
[103:08.54]What do you mean I drove home?
[103:09.68]I ran back to the house.
[103:20.81]Alright, here we go.
[103:23.23]I found out something interesting from Lauren Holt.
[103:25.87]I found out something interesting.
[103:27.47]We're going to get a one sentence explanation.
[103:29.65]Francis Tuttle had a will.
[103:31.21]Judge Danforth never mentioned that.
[103:33.19]That's the one sentence we needed.
[103:35.31]They assume it doesn't exist.
[103:37.51]So if it does exist, Lauren would get the estate.
[103:41.56]There it is.
[103:41.92]I saw something.
[103:43.67]Okay.
[104:09.64]If you were in this room, you would be like, holy shit!
[104:14.43]Every time that happened.
[104:16.57]Every time one of these... How many times have you been in a room with somebody and lightning strikes like that?
[104:20.67]It's like, holy fuck!
[104:25.30]Everybody gets up and everyone walks, paces around.
[104:28.34]These people have iron.
[104:30.84]Iron wills here.
[104:31.58]Whatever they're doing is what they care about.
[104:34.20]That's it.
[104:37.86]Hey, sounds fun to me.
[104:39.44]It's been a long day.
[104:40.76]I think I'm just gonna call it a night.
[104:43.65]You do look kinda...
[104:48.84]It's so loud and so jarring and so scary.
[104:51.67]Yeah, the chowder expired.
[104:54.31]They've been offering it to us for three days.
[104:57.15]Can you get away from the window, too?
[105:00.66]This is when, like, we all huddle into the bathroom.
[105:11.79]that's how scary this is who's Joe there's always an explanation you gotta remember that what is the town of greenwich New York sorry they have a witch on their emblem we won really sending you a pic when can we expect payment didn't lose the bet that's a fire department logo I said police public safety it's all the same a technicality
[105:38.10]There's something I have to get off my chest.
[105:40.78]I saw a ghost.
[105:43.03]Sorry, what?
[105:44.39]His case.
[105:46.07]I've never seen anything like it.
[105:47.45]It's not real.
[105:49.09]I can't explain it.
[105:51.61]What is it?
[105:52.31]What's wrong?
[105:53.71]Hold on.
[105:54.65]Joe looks pretty quirky.
[105:55.99]I don't know why.
[105:56.49]I think that's so funny.
[105:57.25]Wait, what?
[105:57.91]I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[106:00.41]We're not passing on a chance like this.
[106:02.47]Be there before you know it.
[106:05.17]Only if you really want to.
[106:07.18]Talk to you later.
[106:15.73]Is this blood?
[106:16.43]You can't just show... What is going on?
[106:24.74]Blood is getting into my eyes.
[106:25.90]What the fuck?
[106:27.52]It worked!
[106:28.58]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[106:30.32]Now I can't talk shit about the game ever again.
[106:32.48]I can't talk shit about the game.
[106:34.64]It actually got me.
[106:35.26]I can't do that.
[106:37.26]God damn it.
[106:37.92]I can't...
[106:45.61]I got scared by a Nancy Drew game.
[106:47.17]I no longer am allowed to talk about anything.
[106:50.01]I can't make fun of anything.
[106:51.51]I can't talk shit about anything anymore.
[106:53.07]I just got scared in the Nancy Drew game.
[106:55.15]It was pretty- it was good.
[106:55.81]It was pretty good.
[106:56.77]Alright?
[106:57.31]That was good.
[106:58.03]Help make breakfast.
[106:59.14]Are we gonna- my first puzzle in an hour is gonna be chopping up onions.
[107:02.40]I guarantee it.
[107:09.26]This is The Sims!
[107:10.04]You filmed this in The Sims!
[107:13.58]Oh my, oh my, not good, not good, not good!
[107:16.62]You wouldn't be breathing this in.
[107:21.61]They're trying their best to unimpress me.
[107:24.77]Mission accomplished.
[107:26.23]Nancy!
[107:27.94]Joe was just, uh, making an effort.
[107:31.50]It's like the lightning you'd be panicking right now you'd be freaking the fuck out, but he wants to prove he can do it without my help He can set out the ingredients for Johnny cakes before she had to run, but I got to admit It's been a while since I last whipped something up successful This is more accurate
[108:00.80]Let's let this conversation play out.
[108:02.10]No!
[108:17.05]What?
[108:19.43]They fixed it right when I pull up the... How did you fix this?
[108:24.15]It didn't just stop burning.
[108:25.49]What happened?
[108:29.04]Well, it's cleared.
[108:35.82]I actually, I can't fucking believe it.
[108:37.36]I can't believe it.
[108:43.45]Let's approach this sensibly.
[108:45.63]What do we need?
[108:49.13]Still trying to cook.
[108:51.51]Okay, so we need flour, sugar, salt, baking powder.

[111:25.94]A teaspoon of... One teaspoon of salt.
[111:28.50]We're getting there!
[111:30.04]This doesn't look right.

[115:50.67]Timing is important.

[122:32.34]Not saying I'm impressed by that.
[122:34.98]Just stating a fact.
[122:36.74]I prefer someone who possesses a deep intellectual appreciation and table manners.
[122:43.62]You want to be impressed?
[122:45.69]We should finally show her our business plan for our new business.
[122:48.81]What?
[122:49.53]It's very business-y.
[122:52.20]What?
[122:53.06]What is it?
[122:53.86]Well, Joe and I have been talking recently about making things a bit more official.
[122:58.36]We want to franchise out detective work.
[123:00.82]We want to franchise out teenager detective work.
[123:03.92]We're starting our very own detective agency.
[123:05.98]License, insurance, the whole thing.
[123:10.09]And we want to know if you'd be interested in being a partner.
[123:16.49]Thank you, Abe, for the five community subs.
[123:18.11]Thanks, Abe.
[123:18.55]Alright, Drew.
[123:19.73]Both of you.
[123:20.63]Why not update everyone on where we're at?
[123:24.19]Uh, I guess you're wondering about the thing I mentioned.
[123:27.25]One thing I'd like to do today is check the town archives.
[123:29.92]So, I guess you're wondering about the thing I mentioned.
[123:34.64]Yes, sounds super exciting.
[123:35.86]Can't believe the only gameplay we've been able to play has been making pancakes.
[123:41.26]Yeah, I can't explain it.
[123:44.87]Even with the most modern scientific techniques available, there are many phenomena that we still cannot explain.
[123:49.64]I believe what you saw was real.
[123:52.50]What?
[123:53.00]What?
[123:54.02]Sure, some sort of combination of gaseous blow-off and light refraction.
[123:58.78]No, supernatural.
[124:00.22]A ghost, a real ghost, with thoughts and memory and agency.
[124:05.18]I'm not so sure.
[124:07.17]I just built some new equipment that I'd love to try out.
[124:10.29]I'm sure it's nothing.
[124:11.25]But we'll go to the cemetery today and investigate anyway.
[124:14.71]Maybe we can add ghost hunting to our detective services.
[124:18.39]Where are your parents?
[124:22.46]Your parents just let you just go and be ghost detectives and put you...
[124:28.55]How old is everybody here?
[124:30.55]They're rich kids.
[124:31.29]Is this what rich kids do?
[124:32.65]Like, everything is just so taken care of that they just... They make their own detective teenager agency?
[124:39.70]And go hunt ghosts?
[124:41.92]Is that what it is?
[124:45.54]They're like 20.
[124:48.08]Oh.
[124:48.76]I... Yes, actually.
[124:51.75]He doesn't know.
[124:52.57]Oh, mega LOL.
[124:54.44]Mom and dad are out on the yacht.
[125:13.33]And they get like a... Oh, it's Joe.
[125:20.09]Hi, Joe.
[125:22.07]Dad, can I buy a $14,000 expensive-ass ghost hunting kit?
[125:28.08]Yeah, that sounds good, son.
[125:30.12]How are your grades?
[125:32.38]They're great.
[125:33.40]Okay, I won't even look.
[125:35.42]I just trust what you told me.
[125:37.11]Alright, son, absolutely.
[125:38.59]Please just charge it to the company card.
[125:45.25]the arson that happened last week and we haven't had the chance to collect any alibis yet we need to ask everyone we've met where they were on the tax deductible corroborating their answers with whomever they were with will help bring into focus who is and isn't a suspect judge danforth mentioned that he was the victim of a danforth mentioned that he was the victim of a burglary what was stolen
[126:11.63]You're not even gonna do the courtesy eat?
[126:39.07]Where you sit down at somebody's house and you don't want to eat at all.
[126:42.95]And you know that everyone else is going to be eating.
[126:45.17]It's like you're at the family's house or something.
[126:48.25]You have to at least eat the corners.
[126:49.83]You have to eat the ring around the edge.
[126:51.52]And then explain more than five times.
[127:00.33]that you've already eaten.
[127:01.41]And, oh yeah, my mom made like a huge dinner I just ate, so.
[127:05.39]And you said that like 10 times to make sure that they understand why you're not eating your food.
[127:14.16]David, you have not eaten anything.
[127:15.86]And in fact, after you leave this person's house, you like go to like the McDonald's drive-thru.
[127:25.71]We need to figure out how the theft from Moesam Castle is connected to this case.
[127:30.88]Theft of what?
[127:32.26]The Book of Apologies.
[127:34.00]My dad asked me to retrieve it from Moesam Castle in Austria as a favor for Judge Danforth, who works here in Salem.
[127:41.38]It depains all the victims of the witch trials.
[127:44.10]Well, I know why you're not eating yours.
[127:46.68]However, this book was stolen as well.
[127:49.36]We don't see the underside of that one.
[127:51.44]When Nancy was there.
[127:53.32]This is like a well-done pizza crust.
[127:54.18]Speedrun!
[127:54.38]Goddammit, they all left and I didn't even eat anything.
[127:56.26]Nothing.
[127:56.44]Not even one bite.
[127:58.32]Not even a glass of milk.
[128:23.78]Like, then you leave it there 25 minutes go by.
[128:27.75]And you look out the window and you see their car rolling by slowly.
[128:30.75]And they don't know that you're looking out the window and you see, like, three or four Burger King bags.
[128:35.31]And they're eating fries in the fucking passenger seat.
[128:37.29]And you're like, goddammit, those motherfuckers.
[128:40.10]Okay.
[128:41.32]Alright.

[130:28.03]Relax, there's no need to rush.
[130:30.34]Stop pouring them in here so fast.
[130:37.04]Relax, there's no need to rush.
[130:39.35]This is the hardest part of the whole game.
[130:54.71]Alright, we're good.
[130:56.95]Frank would like these.
[130:57.99]What are the ones?
[130:58.69]Get a witch pancake?
[130:59.45]Okay, witch.
[131:04.41]I'm gonna need this for something.
[131:09.85]Fifteen!
[131:10.51]I need to count one, two, three, four hundred.
[131:16.94]I can't even count.
[131:39.45]Not bad.
[131:54.26]One more.
[131:58.26]Oh shit, I don't have any more left.
[131:59.34]This has got to be perfect.
[132:02.34]Alright, I got a witch pancake now.
[132:03.58]Okay, is this turning into Stardew Valley?
[132:10.63]How many things am I going to have in my inventory?
[132:14.05]Alright, well, I have some pancakes.
[132:24.99]Let's see what I can do with this.
[132:30.85]Let's give Olivia a... Well, she's not here anymore.
[132:38.78]Alright.
[132:39.34]Get a key.
[132:40.00]Investigate the break-in.
[132:41.02]The person's just been there.
[132:55.45]Just can't get over the fact that there's protesters in front.
[132:58.31]They can't get over it.
[133:00.96]Okay, there's a break-in.
[133:01.86]You both named Alicia.
[133:02.70]Wow, cool.
[133:03.50]That's weird.
[133:03.88]I thought you were named Nancy.
[133:05.50]Haha.
[133:16.15]You have a hammer drill in here?
[133:17.29]Why'd you ask for it?
[133:17.75]Okay.
[133:17.85]I'm sure you've heard about the burglary.
[133:19.49]I'm sure you've heard about the burglary in the court's evidence room.
[133:33.63]What's happening in this town?
[133:36.53]There's arsons.
[133:37.32]I'm worried there's a pattern here.
[133:39.22]It's the kind of place I want to raise my kids.
[133:42.42]Yes, I want to start a family.
[133:44.26]But who has time?
[133:53.56]The people living in a place like Salem is... I'm not really into Salem.
[133:56.33]He's not part of your little trips of the thing that you're doing?
[133:58.31]Well, he's far away.
[134:06.97]And we've been dating for a couple of years.
[134:08.17]It's not easy to do long distance relationships.
[134:09.67]That's not bad advice.
[134:10.27]Just you do you.
[134:10.71]You do you.
[134:36.08]They don't?
[134:36.70]What?
[134:36.88]Uh, how about... Where were you?
[134:37.88]Did you burn the building down?
[134:40.82]You're a fundraiser.
[134:41.66]Surprised.
[134:58.94]okay uh what who has access to the evidence room as far as I know just me let me in look I don't like saying this but the judge occasionally alright sometimes the judge sometimes the judge sleepwalks the man even locked himself in his own office for pity's sake not that it matters I was told the burglar came from the outside well then is it he's probably leaving doors open
[135:26.55]Mhm.
[135:26.83]Running errands.
[135:27.81]What's the code of the evidence room?
[135:30.25]Alright, get the code.
[135:31.21]Okay.
[135:47.86]Why did you bring your hammer drill to the office?
[135:49.49]Needed more security.

[136:49.97]I know you will.
[136:50.57]Just keep at it.
[136:52.93]Thank you.
[136:56.67]Always let me know if there's anything I can do.

[138:58.46]It's gonna be literally pasted somewhere, like an old person.
[139:03.36]It's gonna be on a post-it note on a computer.
[139:18.46]This is gonna be so easy.
[139:32.01]Whoa, what?

[139:50.10]I just met Jason Danforth.
[139:52.60]What did you think?
[139:54.00]Kind of cute, huh?
[139:55.28]What?

[140:18.14]Doesn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes.
[140:20.40]He is kind of dumb, though.
[140:22.28]I wouldn't really know, to be honest.
[140:24.36]Listen, spare yourself the headache and just avoid him.
[140:27.70]Trust me, not much substance.
[140:29.65]He loves his car.

[142:10.21]Thanks, Dad.
[142:11.25]You know I learned it all from you, right?
[142:13.41]Oh, now I know that's not true.
[142:15.43]The judge told me about a certain lock-picking incident.
[142:18.71]You certainly didn't learn that from me.
[142:22.39]I may have picked up a few extra skills along the way.
[142:25.81]I'd expect nothing less.
[142:28.85]Love you kiddo.
[142:29.99]And dad's gotta go.
[142:31.47]Dad's gotta go.
[142:32.03]He's currently fucking fuming right now.

[143:15.23]Unless you bought it, like, five years ago.
[143:18.23]Oh my god, I knew it.
[143:18.67]I have to look for it.
[143:19.29]I had it somewhere.
[143:20.65]I had it somewhere.
[143:21.61]Okay, cool.
[143:45.51]Get rid of that rusted-ass pencil sharpener.
[143:49.53]That's an emergency room trip if I've ever seen one.
[143:52.17]Alright, what if I look around?
[144:07.74]0815.
[144:10.94]Who's calling me?
[144:13.98]Okay, let's go in the evidence room.
[144:21.06]Do you have a list of the evidence that was taken?
[144:22.40]Okay.
[144:22.50]Take the list with you.
[144:23.30]You're going to find all the evidence.
[144:24.82]It's going to turn into a hidden object game.
[144:27.18]Okay.
[144:27.48]Here we go.
[144:50.49]What was it?
[144:52.75]0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 5.
[144:59.84]Does somebody just break in again?
[145:02.42]What is going on here?
[145:07.06]Why did they like, why did they punch the wall in perfect places six times?
[145:15.53]No glass on the floor.
[145:16.95]So the window was broken from the inside.
[145:22.63]What?
[145:24.88]Nancy.
[145:27.08]Nancy.
[145:27.76]I think it's time to call Dad.
[145:32.20]Oh, man.
[145:32.94]Oh, man.
[145:35.96]Checked out by... Okay, there was a knife.

[150:11.71]Anyone else is welcome to leave a message after the beep.
[150:18.28]I'm sure y'all will hear from him soon.
[150:20.51]Alright, who has access to the evidence room?
[150:22.13]Well, because...
[150:32.01]Do you mind telling me what you were doing three days ago?
[150:35.14]All day?
[150:35.34]I wonder what you ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[150:37.24]Nancy Drew!
[150:37.74]Junior detective!
[150:39.62]That's a thing that I made in like a 3D printer.
[150:41.32]I flip it out like an FBI agent.
[150:42.38]Really?
[150:42.56]Yeah.
[151:01.87]Okay.
[151:01.99]Now a master.
[151:02.31]Watching Jason cut out the stump out of my front view.
[151:05.33]This lady.
[151:05.59]This lady.
[151:06.04]Okay, let's walk out of this room.
[151:31.57]A lawyer is always in need of a good private investigator.
[151:34.75]If your father would be okay with you working for someone else... Call him.
[151:37.48]Leave a message.
[151:37.94]He's calling.
[151:38.22]Alicia, I'm my own woman.
[151:39.86]I work for myself.
[151:41.30]But you've been very helpful, and I really appreciate it.
[151:44.42]Good.
[151:45.30]Well, when you solve this case, let's talk.
[151:50.82]Uh, okay.
[151:53.08]You've been around town.
[151:54.98]I have.
[151:55.46]People with minds as small as the town.
[151:58.32]You can only meet so many with the same mindset before you see a pattern.
[152:01.68]It's interesting.
[152:02.16]Something happened.
[152:02.77]Nothing much.
[152:03.43]Something I just wish this place wouldn't be.
[152:05.23]Something I wish it was a larger town.
[152:06.73]More progressive.
[152:07.41]Imagine a revitalized town.
[152:08.45]Okay, we can dream.
[152:10.39]You're sure.
[152:10.85]Okay, bye.
[152:18.39]Motive.
[152:18.83]Motive.
[152:19.15]We've got a motive.
[152:19.79]What do you mean motive?
[152:28.98]Why are you parked here?
[152:32.22]I don't understand.
[152:35.30]Why are you parked here?
[152:42.19]Are you part of the protest?
[152:43.95]I knew you couldn't resist.
[152:45.71]Yes, you are correct, Jason.
[152:47.62]I could not.
[152:48.48]I'm open tomorrow night.
[152:49.94]Or tonight.
[152:51.06]I don't know.
[152:52.18]I don't have a choice.
[152:53.98]How about three nights ago?
[152:55.58]No one sits on their car like this.
[152:56.92]We already went on a date?
[152:59.41]Definitely not.
[153:00.67]Oh.
[153:02.83]Where were you the night of that Hawthorne house was burned?
[153:05.57]Where were you on... Oh, right.
[153:07.93]I was... I was...
[153:11.65]Do you remember?
[153:12.37]Yeah, yeah.
[153:13.78]It's coming to me.
[153:15.66]Primal Cut.
[153:17.06]I'm sorry.
[153:17.98]It's a steakhouse.
[153:19.08]I was there with my dad.
[153:20.56]Great steak.
[153:21.47]Very expensive.
[153:22.83]He'll tell you.
[153:24.03]So, if we haven't been on a date yet, does that mean we're going to go on one in the future?
[153:28.80]No.
[153:28.92]No, thank you.
[153:30.47]Another question.
[153:31.11]Yes, it's true.
[153:34.92]Shocking.
[153:35.30]I actually wanted to know what you were doing three days ago.
[153:37.78]Are you sure?
[153:38.46]Yes.
[153:39.67]I was actually digging out a stump in Alicia Cole's backyard.
[153:43.94]That's true.
[153:45.20]We have two witnesses that have corroborated the same story, then that must be accurate, unless they're working together.
[153:54.04]Goodbye.
[153:54.44]Alright, so these two make one pancake.
[154:12.95]Why are there protectors in a small town like this?
[154:20.16]Alibis from Book Theft.
[154:21.40]Yeah, the alibis for the artist.
[154:22.64]Investigates breaking into the courthouse.
[154:24.40]Getting key to the Hawthorne house.
[154:28.74]The Hathorne.
[154:29.44]Is it Hathorne?
[154:30.62]Hawthorne?
[154:31.50]Hathorne?
[154:32.12]How do I pronounce this?
[154:37.79]Is it Hathorne?
[154:40.13]Hawthorne?
[154:41.39]Hothorne?
[154:42.09]Hathorne?
[154:44.86]What's the big holdup?
[154:46.56]The Perry brat has always been a little firestarter.
[154:49.70]Only a matter of time until the neighborhood watch catches her red-handed.
[154:53.86]The system has gone soft.
[154:55.72]Lets them off the hook easy.
[154:57.16]Then everyone acts surprised about repeated offenders.
[155:00.56]They better book her before Halloween.
[155:02.64]I don't want to let the kids out trick-or-treating with an arsonist on the loose.
[155:11.44]Here's the thing.
[155:16.08]You're not gonna... If they... What?
[155:19.92]I don't understand that logic.
[155:21.44]Alright.
[155:22.04]Where am I?
[155:22.30]I need to go... Did I not investigate the break-in good enough?
[155:25.82]I need a key for the house.
[155:30.35]Where's Perry...
[155:35.34]Harry.
[155:37.64]Where's this person?
[155:41.13]No, I'm not clicking her.
[155:46.46]Alright, I need to go.
[155:49.06]I'm going to go to the museum.
[155:56.85]text user has been added to the chat what chat did I get dragged into an annoying famous Nancy Drew finally arrived to solve our ghostly conundrums
[156:07.30]What is this?
[156:08.46]Oh, it's an obnoxious group chat that you cannot get rid out of.
[156:12.98]And we're gonna blow up your phone all fucking day.
[156:15.33]There's like 10 people in here.
[156:17.39]And if you leave this conversation, then we all know that you didn't want to be here in the first place.
[156:23.49]So you have to stomach this every single fucking day.
[156:28.81]Every day.
[156:34.88]until you inevitably leave the conversation, and then you text every person that was in that conversation, and you say, hey, my phone was stolen last night.
[156:46.99]I have to get a new phone number.
[156:54.09]Okay, I don't know, this is just absolute gibberish.
[157:00.04]Uh... We're trying to figure out what could have caused you to see a ghost.
[157:03.98]Maybe an actual ghost.
[157:05.42]Like this?
[157:06.22]Only in the good days.
[157:07.66]Hey, I'm here, you know.
[157:08.42]We know, we know.
[157:09.32]Oh, cute.
[157:10.04]Haha, dude.
[157:11.17]I'm gonna go follow some leads.
[157:12.07]Good luck.
[157:12.41]Let us know.
[157:13.09]Wasting data.
[157:22.37]Is this ready yet?
[157:25.71]Nancy, hey, how's the investigation going?
[157:28.25]It's going good.
[157:28.85]Where were you?
[157:29.63]You know, it would really help if I could get May to talk to me.
[157:33.57]She hasn't given her alibi yet.
[157:35.50]No, and everyone seems to have one, except her.
[157:39.18]How do I know that?
[157:39.76]I've talked to one, two people.
[157:40.94]Is it possible that it could be someone from outside of town, a visitor or something?
[157:45.82]Absolutely, but statistically speaking, crime is rarely a random occurrence.
[157:51.06]It's a mystery to me.
[157:53.64]What?
[157:53.98]You have anything you wanted to talk about?
[157:59.01]Is that true?
[158:06.66]That feels... Yeah, that feels... That's, like, not true.
[158:13.23]The person that, like... Steals your purse on the sidewalk... Is an old family friend.
[158:21.80]Okay, what's the history behind the Hathorne estate?
[158:24.90]What's the history behind the Hathorne estate?
[158:27.22]That's how you pronounce it.
[158:27.96]Cool.
[158:28.80]Alright, cool.
[158:50.39]Is the fire somehow related?
[158:51.67]Do you think the fire is somehow related to Salem's history with... What do you mean?
[158:56.44]Like, is it meant as a symbolic gesture?
[158:58.90]That was a European thing.
[159:00.56]No, they were more civilized in the New World.
[159:03.06]No, I think they just did it for no reason.
[159:07.47]A couple more died in custody awaiting... It was a random crime.
[159:10.77]You know that most crimes are random, right?
[159:12.45]Why would you even ask me that?
[159:14.83]Pressed?
[159:15.71]Yeah.
[159:16.57]They put a bunch of heavy stones on top of you.
[159:19.19]over a period of days that's horrible she did not know the weight until she felt the freedom scarlet letter also a descendant of judge hathorne except nathaniel hawthorne was so horrified with his family's history that he added a w to change it wow the focus on descendants isn't real yep we think our world is so much more advanced now but we have a hard time escaping our past
[159:50.22]Where were you three nights ago?
[159:52.02]There was this photo tucked away in the guest room.
[159:54.12]Got ya.
[159:56.20]Witches.
[159:56.44]Witches.
[160:19.25]Sour Tower Diamond Juke?
[160:20.99]I'm fucking talking.
[160:34.80]Uh, where were you on the night of the fire?
[160:36.66]Does Salem not have any police?
[160:37.75]No.
[160:51.72]Call him.
[160:51.90]Okay.
[160:52.10]Sure.
[160:52.20]I'm gonna... I'll call him right now.
[160:54.34]Right now.
[160:54.74]Let's see.
[161:19.83]Why is that your profile?
[161:20.63]Is this Damien Faulkner?
[161:22.20]Yeah, who is this?
[161:23.56]Hi, my name is Nancy Drew.
[161:25.88]I'm a private investigator currently working the Hathorne House case on behalf of Judge Danforth.
[161:31.48]Do you mind if I take up a minute of your time?
[161:33.63]Um, go ahead.
[161:35.51]Just wanted to follow up on some statements.
[161:37.55]Statements made by who?
[161:39.77]Tegan Perry.
[161:40.91]Yes?
[161:41.77]Your girlfriend.
[161:42.45]Who's that?
[161:42.89]Right, right.
[161:43.79]Where were you?
[161:45.02]Sorry, but...
[161:46.48]Were these statements given to the police?
[161:48.50]Um, no.
[161:49.16]Who was that?
[161:50.28]They were given to me, willingly.
[161:52.38]Yeah, sorry.
[161:53.92]I work for Alicia, and I've learned to make sure that when you're being questioned, you always have a lawyer present.
[161:59.27]I don't want to sound like I'm guilty or complicit, I just know my rights.
[162:02.97]Of course.
[162:03.81]But you sound trustworthy.
[162:04.89]God.
[162:05.31]Oh, thanks.
[162:06.81]How long have you worked for Alicia?
[162:08.75]Guilty, yeah.
[162:09.03]I've been here for her for a while, but she doesn't really pay attention to me.
[162:13.35]You seem to know a lot about legal framework.
[162:15.99]Press him.
[162:16.67]Press him.
[162:18.27]I'm gone.
[162:19.69]Anyway, I was with Tegan on the night of the fire.
[162:22.17]That's what you wanted to know, right?
[162:23.49]Yeah.
[162:23.93]Yeah.
[162:24.35]What did you guys do?
[162:24.79]What did you guys do?
[162:26.23]Watched a movie.
[162:27.09]Okay.
[162:27.83]What movie?
[162:28.49]Which movie?
[162:29.47]Honestly, couldn't tell you.
[162:31.21]Tegan picks.
[162:31.75]You don't know what movie you watched?
[162:32.61]You know, there's always some kind of vampire drama, apocalyptic, teenage-y, angsty thing.
[162:38.29]Oh, like this game.
[162:39.61]Like the game we're in.
[162:40.81]Okay.
[162:41.41]Okay.
[162:42.49]Okay.
[162:57.85]How did Francis Tuttle come to own the property?
[163:01.16]Ms.
[163:01.40]Tuttle bought it 30 years ago, cheap.
[163:03.70]It was falling apart.
[163:04.90]The former owners couldn't be located, so it was auctioned.
[163:08.54]She was a bit of a kooky lady living in a ruin like that.
[163:12.10]She was kind.
[163:13.49]I mean, she took in Lauren like a daughter.
[163:15.83]That says something about someone, doesn't it?
[163:17.91]I agree.
[163:18.41]What were you doing three nights ago?
[163:20.81]I don't remember what you were doing three nights ago.
[163:23.11]Ice skating.
[163:24.21]Movie.
[163:24.49]I mean, movie.
[163:24.97]Movie.
[163:25.32]Oh, no.
[163:25.64]Arrest me.
[163:26.04]I'm sorry.
[163:26.90]Why?
[163:28.15]You were working at the museum.
[163:30.14]Can anyone confirm that?
[163:31.92]Well, I'm always here.
[163:33.88]But was anyone else here?
[163:36.16]May was home all day, laying low.
[163:38.40]And Olivia wasn't here either.
[163:40.62]I don't know where she was, to be honest.
[163:42.08]You'll have to ask her.
[163:43.69]So no one can confirm that?
[163:45.95]And you're sure May was at home?
[163:47.95]She's barely left the house since the incident.
[163:50.47]People here treat her like she has an infectious disease.
[163:53.17]It's awful.
[163:54.57]And I don't blame her if she wants to sit at home on her phone all day.
[163:58.14]uh our parents need to come home soon wait what so I gotta ask what do I get out of this you get out of this I get a lot really justice matters travel around talk to all these people deal with all their problems put yourself in harm's way
[164:16.00]Not always.
[164:17.36]Alright, some of the time.
[164:19.18]I don't know.
[164:20.13]It's like there's these small obstacles that I enjoy working on.
[164:23.53]And they're interesting.
[164:25.07]But what I really love is the puzzle of humanity.
[164:27.80]What makes people tick?
[164:29.12]Why do people do what they do?
[164:31.77]This is a great comment.
[164:32.99]I know he's not skipping lines right now, but it sounds like he is.
[164:47.24]and cereal grains might have gotten into the food supply.
[164:50.51]It poisons anyone who eats it.
[164:52.19]Wait, we got a poisoned food supply?
[164:55.65]It would have made people look like they were possessed.
[164:58.17]Or made the judges think they were doing God's will.
[165:00.81]Or make the whole town go haywire.
[165:02.58]A rational explanation for irrational behavior.
[165:06.84]Just a theory.
[165:08.06]We'll never know.
[165:09.56]Anyway, I don't want to keep you.
[165:11.72]Thanks for stopping by.
[165:12.80]Thank you.
[165:13.28]By the way, Tegan, don't take this the wrong way, but seriously, that is the ugliest plant I have ever seen in my entire life.
[165:29.54]It's awful.
[165:32.58]Just put a cactus on here.
[165:34.90]This takes up 20% of your entire desk.
[165:40.14]It is so ugly.
[165:42.01]I'm sorry.
[165:42.67]I had to just tell you.
[165:44.46]And why do you have two computers?
[165:45.68]Why do you have two computers next to each other?
[165:54.40]Gamer?
[165:56.64]No, this is a cash register.

[166:14.68]This is so big.
[166:15.30]It actually is a fucking mega desk.
[166:37.54]It's so huge.
[166:38.60]Your desk is so big you don't even know what to put on it.
[166:41.42]You've got like, you've got like the, uh, the, uh, a Bible.

[166:45.56]Ooh, open the door.
[166:46.18]What door?
[166:46.42]What the fuck just happened?
[166:48.32]Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
[166:49.24]Why is there a secret entrance?
[167:08.08]Was anyone paying any attention?
[167:15.43]Nobody was.
[167:15.85]How do I get back there?
[167:39.85]She's gonna lock me up here.
[167:40.61]Restricted?
[167:41.01]What do you mean, restricted?
[167:45.43]Is this Harry Potter?
[167:46.09]What are you talking about?
[168:11.59]Someone's a busy bee.
[168:13.43]Old court protocols, ancestry records.
[168:16.86]Taken is really digging deep into the witch trials.
[168:23.10]I can't read this.
[168:23.70]Alright, so I'll just look for a code.
[168:29.30]Scarlet Letter, Samuel, Paris, Perry.
[168:31.56]Alright, that's all I needed to hear.
[168:33.40]Just those words, the highlighted one.
[168:38.66]Recipes with pancakes.
[168:41.12]It's 10.15 always.
[168:45.16]This is freaking me out.
[168:46.28]Every clock is 10.15.
[168:47.32]There's a stray book.
[169:01.36]The secret underground passage is to smuggle the illegal goods to gangsters and gain wealth of the illegal beverage.
[169:05.70]The bootleggers hold the inscription marked the way underground for a... Okay.
[169:31.58]What else can I do up here?
[169:33.34]Is that all I can do?
[169:35.32]Something else with a desk.
[169:36.16]A secret book.
[169:42.96]No other books or anything.
[169:44.16]Nothing.
[169:44.60]Nothing hidden.
[169:48.44]The first puzzle of this game was I had to click on a tiny square on a desk and open it.
[169:53.59]Nothing like that has happened since.
[169:58.33]We learned about the history of Salem.
[170:07.03]This has to be another secret.
[170:08.13]Yeah, there has to be another secret.
[170:25.30]Candles?
[170:29.64]Yeah, I could do something with the couch.
[170:32.25]Why would this be here?
[170:37.31]yuck something under the couch you wouldn't just have a couch you wouldn't there's no reason for this couch to exist that's not that nobody would have a couch because the video game is telling me whoa originals these books must be hundreds of years old yeah they're hundreds of years old but I'm hearing nothing
[171:13.19]What's that?
[171:14.71]There's a message.
[171:15.27]There's a message over there.
[171:23.29]What does it say?
[171:26.99]Two... What?
[171:30.81]The message is outside.
[171:31.81]Oh, god damn it.
[171:35.28]I know.
[171:35.46]Look, I can see the outline of the door that's back there.
[171:42.00]A broom?
[171:46.36]Pencils, pens, anything.
[171:47.80]Oh, fuck.
[171:50.85]Whatever, let's go.

[173:05.60]We jubated him.
[173:12.50]Wait, is the gift shop open?
[173:14.02]The gift shop's open!
[173:15.79]It's open!
[173:26.16]Oh, face cave in rocks.
[173:28.77]Cool.
[173:33.65]I've seen that before.
[173:34.63]Where?
[173:35.09]I just left.
[173:46.19]No, go back in.
[173:56.36]Oh, it's you.
[173:57.30]It's you.
[173:57.70]Wait, you like pancakes.
[173:59.40]Right off the bat.
[174:01.42]Here.
[174:02.48]Yes.
[174:04.60]Oh, how fitting.
[174:07.16]A witch cake for the resident witch.
[174:09.76]Aren't you just the sweetest?
[174:11.32]So thoughtful.
[174:12.70]You know, seeing this, I think you might have some magical energy flowing through you.
[174:18.53]With enough flair and a touch of charisma, you could really go a long way as a witch.
[174:24.95]Thank you, but I've got my career goals set a little differently.
[174:29.28]Enjoy the food.
[174:30.00]You're back.
[174:31.48]Great.
[174:38.70]Let me guess, more questions?
[174:41.58]Spooky.
[174:42.92]Where were you three days ago?
[174:45.34]Well, I was ordering pizzas.
[174:47.44]Three days ago, were you doing any witch tours?
[174:50.60]Three days ago?
[174:51.88]No, I was not.
[174:53.43]Three days.
[174:54.09]Okay, you remember what you were doing?
[174:57.59]Actually, I had won a spa holiday at the Wayfarer Inn over in Marblehead.
[175:02.03]It was amazing.
[175:03.83]Oh, dude, Marblehead?
[175:05.21]I know what that is.
[175:09.32]It was wicked crazy.
[175:10.08]They did their research.
[175:11.30]You went from Boston to, like, Michigan.
[175:13.08]I had... I did have a flyer.
[175:15.36]I had this wicked cool flyer.
[175:37.75]Okay, yeah, that's a lie.
[175:39.78]I've heard ghosts are haunting Salem.
[175:41.34]It's about you, Tegan, and Lauren when you were kids.
[175:44.80]It's about you, Tegan, and Lauren when you were kids.
[175:48.32]Why are you interested in this?
[175:49.84]We grew apart.
[175:50.78]It happens.
[175:51.58]Lie.
[175:52.40]I found an old photo from back then.
[175:53.72]Lie.
[175:54.02]That's a lie.
[175:54.76]It had the name Coven on it.
[175:56.34]Look.
[175:57.72]Was it the one you talk about in your show?
[176:00.22]You found this photo at Tegan's house?
[176:04.06]I didn't peg her as sentimental.
[176:06.20]So was it the same one?
[176:08.19]Well, yes.
[176:09.87]Same coven.
[176:11.03]We heard about it as kids, I guess.
[176:14.09]We were all into history and witches.
[176:16.07]We still are.
[176:18.31]And yet you've never made up.
[176:20.19]I don't get why you care.
[176:21.67]Defensive.
[176:24.04]Getting defensive.
[176:25.12]Even if you all tell me it isn't.
[176:29.64]I've been going around asking everyone in town where they were on the night of the arson.
[176:34.32]The night of the what?
[176:36.00]Arson.
[176:37.02]How do you not know this?
[176:38.50]Why, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[176:41.40]Imagine not knowing about a famous house burning down.
[176:45.08]Okay, I was going to say.
[176:46.00]Alright, spare me this bullshit.
[176:48.26]Don't look so serious.
[176:49.74]Don't, please.
[176:50.32]I'm here on an investigation.
[176:51.56]I was here that night doing my thing.
[176:55.13]I think there had to have been at least 20 people who can confirm that.
[176:58.76]It really stinks that Lauren is going to lose her home.
[177:02.44]Well, we'll see.
[177:03.74]Yeah, of course.
[177:07.30]They're ghost hunting.
[177:08.56]Of course.
[177:10.10]You believe it.
[177:11.32]How could I not when I've seen them with my own eyes?
[177:15.30]Really?
[177:15.78]Can you describe what you saw?
[177:19.38]Sure.
[177:19.92]It was dark, foggy.
[177:23.44]I was walking through the cemetery.
[177:26.32]Or was it the town square?
[177:27.38]I don't remember, but I do remember a ghost.
[177:30.60]Ooh, scary.
[177:31.90]No, multiple ghosts.
[177:33.43]Spirits.
[177:35.01]How much for the bowling ball?
[177:35.85]And did you ever see a ghost near Hathorne House?
[177:38.29]As a matter of fact, I did.
[177:41.00]I told you that a coven of witches unleashed them on the town a few years back.
[177:45.87]They will not rest until... She was bored?
[177:48.43]What?
[177:49.59]Let me guess.
[177:51.21]You can't find proof of a living soul... Hey, ACDC freak, thanks for the five community cells.
[177:55.99]Maybe the culprit wasn't among the living?
[177:59.36]That sounds even harder to prove.
[178:01.80]Have you seen the restless souls of Salem, Nancy?
[178:06.30]I've seen something, but I'm not willing to just believe it's real.
[178:10.10]I need more.
[178:11.08]be careful that World of Warcraft find you whether you believe in the new trailer for the new human redesign you might want to avoid the cemetery okay got it that's what it was that's what I've been trying to find what it was that's what I was trying to figure it out I figured it out when like cataclysm came out it was like this like the big redesign of all the models that's what this is
[178:37.90]It's been bugging me for at least 20 minutes or so.
[178:40.41]30 minutes.
[178:41.39]I haven't even talked about it.
[178:47.15]That's no joke.
[178:48.97]I didn't want to bring it up because I didn't want you guys to think about it.
[178:50.65]What the fuck is he talking about?
[178:51.75]I should have just kept it internal, apparently.
[178:54.25]I guess.
[178:56.21]That was Warloads of... Was it?
[178:59.97]Didn't they start that in... Home Depot OST.
[179:05.77]See you later.
[179:08.18]No, just rewind two days.
[179:09.34]Alright, what have we learned?
[179:12.42]Did I get alibis?
[179:13.00]Investigate the... I gotta go back to the break-in.
[179:17.30]Alright, let me... Do you have any books that I can touch?
[179:22.12]I only have 10, 15 clocks.
[179:22.76]What about this?
[179:36.60]I have to show this to, uh, I know, I know, I know, alright, alright, back it up, back it up, I know what I have to do.
[179:44.29]I have to go show that to Tegan.
[179:49.03]And say, hey, what's going on here?
[179:52.31]Why did you do all this shit?
[179:58.72]Excuse me.
[180:01.60]Deidra only mentioned it in passing, but you and Olivia used to be friends.
[180:04.46]Okay.
[180:04.60]Years ago, if you don't get along, we spread apart.
[180:06.21]This is not... Yeah.
[180:06.71]Okay.
[180:26.66]I would... Okay.
[180:27.54]Who has a motive?
[180:28.82]What can you tell me about Olivia?
[180:30.73]Okay, you don't like what she's doing because she's mocking you for being a real witch.
[180:48.98]do you think she would have burned down the hat I suppose it would be good for business okay people love a ruin especially a haunted ruin she is pretty happy lighting fires but I don't know she gets happy when fires are cleared I know I can't help but think about the rumor Olivia talks that you shouldn't pay any attention to her stories she just says whatever she thinks the crowd wants sure
[181:11.85]Real history isn't interesting to Olivia.
[181:14.63]Real magic like you do.
[181:17.01]I didn't say that.
[181:18.43]There are no witches in Salem.
[181:20.48]Just showy frauds and stupid kids doing stupid things.
[181:24.20]Don't trouble yourself with ancient history.
[181:27.18]Alright.
[181:27.98]What's this?
[181:28.30]Do you like pancakes?
[181:32.04]Okay, I've had this rust remover for two in-game hours.
[181:42.30]What do I need to do with this?
[181:51.00]Remove some rust already.
[181:52.74]I'm trying!
[181:54.06]Cool.
[181:55.24]What about this place?
[182:12.12]Oh, you're here.
[182:13.20]Oh.
[182:14.00]Yes, I am.
[182:15.16]This shop is really cool.
[182:17.13]I love the decor.
[182:18.47]Thank you.
[182:19.69]It's taken a lot of years to get it the way I want.
[182:22.77]I kind of imagine this is what an actual witch's shop would look like.
[182:27.08]Yeah.
[182:28.36]I think these are Minecraft stakes.
[182:31.02]Look, St.
[182:31.92]John's wort, mandrake root.
[182:34.16]You know, witches were just synonymous with people who used the old medieval ways of working with plants and animals, curing ills.
[182:41.85]They were healers, shamans, and confessors.
[182:44.87]You can see why some people might have been threatened by them.
[182:47.67]I know, right?
[182:48.97]No leeches here, though.
[182:50.57]I draw the line at Bloodsucker.
[182:52.42]I'm standing very far away.
[182:53.62]I'm glad you get it.
[182:54.36]A lot of people around here don't.
[182:55.86]How so?
[182:56.68]Some say I'm cashing in, not respecting history.
[183:00.23]People get so caught up in the death and judgment.
[183:03.20]That's right.
[183:04.16]Okay.
[183:04.52]You get a lot of people in.
[183:06.02]Maybe Mae Perry, for instance.
[183:07.52]Mm-hmm.
[183:07.88]Nancy Drew is Jimmy Neutron.
[183:09.18]What do you mean Jimmy Neutron?
[183:11.28]The same voice actress?
[183:38.79]Is it?
[183:39.80]No it's not.
[183:41.16]Is it though?
[183:42.61]Gosh, these pastries look delicious.
[184:06.10]No, you're completely wrong.
[184:29.01]Uh, okay, what are we doing?
[184:29.95]Alright, we're gonna- it's time to speedrun.
[184:33.83]Speedrun to the next gaming section.

[184:40.58]What?
[184:42.56]Alright.

[185:59.81]Right, okay.
[186:01.13]So how do I make these?

[192:34.37]Thank you.
[192:36.54]Okay.
[192:41.64]What was the point of doing this?

[192:52.09]No.
[192:56.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[193:25.19]Where were you on that, Mike?
[193:26.01]At the time I got home.
[193:46.79]I need garlic for my unbearable appetite.
[193:51.66]No, you got that wrong.
[193:53.36]I need a full bowl of spaghetti and meatballs to cure my unbearable appetite.
[193:58.46]I need a two large orders of buffalo wings.
[194:00.74]Okay, cool.
[194:13.84]Is there a coven in Salem?
[194:20.28]Everyone says there's ghosts in this town.
[194:21.58]Do you think there are ghosts here?
[194:22.98]Well, that... Remember where you were that night?
[194:24.84]I forgot to mention.
[194:25.88]Okay.
[194:26.02]Good.
[194:43.55]Talk to Alicia!
[194:52.45]Can she waiting room ban that person?
[195:09.39]Okay, Alicia.
[195:12.03]Hey Alicia, do you have any, you know, jobs I could do?
[195:20.57]I'm really good at cutting up carrots and shit.
[195:23.69]Yes, can I help you?
[195:26.44]If you need somebody to clean your juicer.
[195:30.36]Do you know Lauren Holtz?
[195:33.22]Owner of Luminous Infusions.
[195:35.54]Resident of the Hathorne Estate Carriage House.
[195:38.49]So do you know her?
[195:39.81]Absolutely.
[195:42.01]Okay, how's the case?
[195:42.69]I am.
[195:42.79]Need to get the will.
[195:43.41]Good.
[195:43.51]Okay, I promise.
[195:44.03]Let me give you guys a reality here.
[195:45.83]If the next piece of gameplay is cooking or preparing food items,
[196:07.99]I will Alt-F4 the game.
[196:08.95]I promise.
[196:09.17]Wait, I just got the key.
[196:09.65]I got the key to the house.
[196:10.53]Let's go.
[196:10.81]Wait, I need to investigate this more.
[196:12.67]What else is there?
[196:13.29]Huh?
[196:13.59]What do you got for me?
[196:43.26]Investigate this.
[196:53.93]No, we're going right to the house.
[196:58.92]What do we want?
[197:00.08]Justice!
[197:01.34]When do we want it?
[197:02.56]Now!
[197:03.14]What do we want?
[197:04.08]This poor lady.
[197:05.68]What do we want?
[197:08.92]Justice!
[197:10.12]When do we want it?
[197:11.06]Now!
[197:14.43]I feel so bad for that lady.
[197:25.21]Okay.
[197:26.33]You've made it to... No, where am I going?
[197:28.96]No, no, no.
[197:29.46]That was the right way.
[197:30.10]Go back.
[197:42.48]Ugh...
[197:44.03]Wow, I knew Salem was small, but I didn't know Salem was two streets.
[197:55.49]Although, it took a long time to drive here on one road.
[197:57.85]Let's go, let's go.
[198:19.51]Hmm.
[198:26.02]Oh!
[198:26.52]It's locked!
[198:27.82]Are you serious?
[198:33.09]What are you talking about?
[198:34.91]Rust!
[198:51.15]The door needs more leverage?
[198:54.68]What do I have?
[198:57.06]Put another key in first.
[199:00.34]Put in two cartridges.
[199:03.30]One on top of the other.
[199:04.28]Put one Nintendo cartridge in and then push down, place and put another Nintendo cartridge on top.
[199:11.77]And then it'll work.
[199:24.11]The Nancy Drew series is going to die, at least in America, and it may well be deserved.
[199:45.42]I can't see the competitive community or even the casual player base surviving into next year.
[199:49.55]The reasons are numerous.
[199:56.27]I know that's a... you copy and pasted what you just said, and you might have made it up, but why do I feel like that's like a Steam review?
[200:02.41]Alright, get it in there.
[200:05.87]Wedge it in there.
[200:10.56]Get that key.
[200:11.24]Go.
[200:24.84]hmm vegetables and fruits I could cut up one of these an old secretary desk roaring 20s maybe okay key rust this opens with a button somewhere I know it those of you that didn't chat right now no it doesn't yes it does
[200:52.00]If I don't, I'm going to press a button somewhere and it's going to open.
[200:55.40]Yes, it does.
[201:08.30]It doesn't.
[201:08.78]Yes, it does.
[201:10.44]The walls are still smoldering from the fire.
[201:13.01]It's making my eyes water.
[201:15.27]The walls are still smoldering from the fire.
[201:24.78]There's something peculiar about this mirror.
[201:29.91]Someone painted laurels on the mirror glass.
[201:33.59]I smoke alarm.
[201:38.20]That scared the shit out of me.
[201:40.48]Wait, what is it about a thing?
[201:42.36]Rust be gone!
[201:46.60]What's wrong with this?
[201:47.34]There's a little etching on it.
[201:48.60]So, who cares?
[201:55.32]Ooh, we found a jacket.
[201:56.04]A name on this jacket?
[201:57.22]I can't unzip?
[201:57.72]Oh, hello.
[201:58.04]A business card.
[202:25.36]Raven, witch tours.
[202:26.94]Uh-oh.
[202:28.14]Olivia Ravencroft.
[202:34.16]Uh-oh.
[202:35.12]Olivia Ravencroft.
[202:37.71]What were you doing here?
[202:38.77]What were you doing here?
[202:41.33]Uh-oh.
[202:41.45]It's dusty.
[202:54.70]What the fuck is this?
[202:58.98]Got a text?
[202:59.76]Nope.
[202:59.94]Does the phone work?
[203:21.10]The scary thing's gonna walk by the woods over there.
[203:23.06]That's a perfect place for it.
[203:23.90]I don't know why you didn't do it.
[203:28.43]Quick, what?
[203:28.89]Okay.
[203:30.31]Well, I got the business card.
[203:47.39]What about, uh, on the wall?
[203:49.11]Boxes.
[203:49.55]What's this?
[203:49.91]Is there something in the boxes?
[203:51.87]What's the painting?
[203:53.03]Not the painting.
[203:53.61]The... You know what I'm saying.
[203:55.15]The mirror.
[203:55.85]What's the mirror for?
[203:57.05]How do I open this?
[203:57.61]I gotta press a button.
[204:02.21]Oh!
[204:02.69]Okay, this is... What's... What... Okay, wait a minute.
[204:06.01]This is a reflection of something.
[204:08.94]There's something on here.
[204:09.92]An old...
[204:19.00]Anti-rust on this spreader.
[204:26.32]What about on the side?
[204:42.22]Yeah.
[204:43.54]Good call.
[204:50.53]No, there's nothing there.
[204:52.29]Good call.
[205:03.12]Nancy should not be breathing this stuff in.
[205:06.14]No.
[205:06.38]Alright, I got the jacket and I got the wall on the left side.
[205:11.50]I don't see anything.
[205:21.12]What do you see?
[205:22.91]There's just this etching.
[205:32.51]You have an AW key.
[205:34.09]Yeah, I can't use it.
[205:34.85]I already tried that.
[205:36.27]AW key.
[205:36.73]See?
[205:36.81]Ah, the game crashed.
[206:12.53]What is it gonna put me?
[206:21.88]Alright, I know, I know, listen guys, everybody listen, listen.
[206:34.07]I'm gonna speedrun this again.
[206:35.23]No, stop doing that.
[206:42.68]I got the jacket, I got the business card, let's go.
[206:51.00]98% Nancy Drew speedrun.
[206:53.72]It's possible.
[207:00.72]I can't go over here anymore?
[207:01.54]Alright, let's go interrogate, uh, the witch lady.
[207:10.75]Speedrun of Baldi's Basics.
[207:12.94]Creepy.
[207:14.82]Creep.
[207:19.02]Creep.
[207:23.79]Creep.
[207:47.82]Got ya. Got ya. Got ya. Got ya. Got ya.
[207:53.04]Say it with me.
[207:53.52]Got ya.
[207:54.26]Got ya.
[207:54.86]We got ya. We got ya. We got ya. We got ya. We got ya. We got ya.
[208:04.05]What?
[208:05.17]You're back!
[208:07.47]I found this jacket.
[208:09.13]Oh my gosh, where'd you find it?
[208:10.43]I've been looking for this.
[208:12.38]It was in the Hathorne house.
[208:13.82]Oh, something must have stolen it.
[208:16.40]That's it?
[208:45.31]I just handed over evidence.
[208:47.91]What an idiot.
[208:48.63]Like, what a dope.
[209:17.61]Let's go play by the train tracks.
[209:20.67]What does that even mean?
[209:28.21]What?
[209:29.29]Alright, somebody does it.
[209:30.63]I want to speedrun this.
[209:33.11]I don't have any evidence.
[209:34.24]Here is a business card.
[209:36.02]Can I spray somebody in the face with this yet?
[209:40.46]We just want justice.
[209:49.38]There's something that I didn't do here.
[209:50.82]What is it?
[209:55.63]Is this a bed frame?
[210:12.20]I don't get it.
[210:19.88]Anything at the house?
[210:21.81]It's the bars on the window.
[210:29.87]But... Who cares?
[210:31.75]I feel like there's something with the computer that I can't do.
[210:50.51]It's dusty.
[210:51.95]It's dusty.
[210:58.65]Imagine if you needed a key to turn your computer on.
[211:04.49]Like a car.
[211:10.50]A map of Salem.
[211:12.66]This doesn't matter.
[211:14.94]What does this matter?
[211:17.58]Investigate the break-in.
[211:18.78]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[211:21.17]a cctv camera oh there might be footage from the break-in alright let's go I went through the missing evidence and was able to get a list of everything that's missing judge
[211:39.27]Judge.
[211:39.99]I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you, Nancy.
[211:44.53]I know.
[211:45.25]What?
[211:46.09]You know?
[211:47.41]Let's just say I can tell when someone is trying to hide something from me.
[211:51.49]The reason Carson sent you to Mosem Castle was because I already knew what was stolen from the courthouse.
[211:58.53]Tegan Perry had assembled a packet of documents outlining her accused witch's claims on the Hathorne house.
[212:05.97]Someone from Sweden, I must admit that I've already figured out the entire storyline.
[212:18.13]I'll hold my tongue for you Americans though.
[212:31.55]Uh, okay.
[212:33.15]Do you remember... Do you have the CCTV footage from the break-in?
[212:39.03]Didn't even turn the cameras off.
[212:44.43]And he broke into his own house.
[212:45.94]Well, you see, Nancy, I haven't been completely honest with you.
[212:51.22]You know how I lock myself in places?
[212:55.06]Well, I was going in the evidence room to get a snack.
[212:58.85]And I got stuck in the cage.
[213:01.19]So I just picked up the computer desk and smashed it into the window.
[213:05.26]And I climbed out.
[213:07.30]I do this once in a week.
[213:11.08]I need help.
[213:12.58]I need to be helped.
[213:14.35]Do you remember any details about the AW evidence?
[213:18.47]I don't remember much, unfortunately.
[213:21.73]Oh, there was this key with its blade shape to spell AW.
[213:26.53]Very weak.
[213:28.21]Not sure what it was connected to.
[213:31.03]Like this one?
[213:32.07]Yes, that's it.
[213:33.85]Where did you find this?
[213:35.87]Just missing a ton of painful reverb, yeah.
[213:39.05]The theft of the book of apologies and the theft of evidence from the courthouse.
[213:43.91]Someone is going to great lengths to prevent the AW organization from having a claim on the Hawthorne estate.
[213:51.32]Any educated guess who that might be?
[213:53.58]Practically everybody in this town.
[213:55.70]Everyone has an interest.
[213:59.17]Carnival?
[214:00.11]Oh, I love carnivals.
[214:04.33]I'll have to dig deeper.
[214:05.95]Well, you'll need to do it quickly.
[214:07.31]I unfortunately must file the... Let's go ahead and put our sponge down that you have.
[214:19.46]And let's even out that census box.
[214:37.13]Yes, I'm losing viewers.
[214:40.13]The second Bugleberry is audible.
[214:42.99]2,000 people leave.
[214:51.89]Okay, what evidence?
[214:52.91]Who cares?
[214:53.47]Without any evidence or will, what's the legal status of the house?
[214:57.61]Well, that is a somewhat complicated question.
[215:02.12]So many moving parts and interested parties with crossover jurisdictions.
[215:06.98]You're the one who decides.
[215:08.26]I feel like that's on the same level as the slap.
[215:11.20]I can tell you're not happy about being the center of such a large decision.
[215:15.42]Well, it's muddy, legally, and complicated for other reasons.
[215:19.86]Because it's not just who lives there.
[215:21.46]It's tied up in the town's history.
[215:24.52]Yes, not to be taken lightly.
[215:29.79]Okay, where were you when this evidence was stolen?
[215:31.41]How would you not know this is happening?
[215:32.87]Headaches, I got something for that.
[215:35.19]It's cinnamon and feverfew.
[215:38.05]Mash it up into a bowl and then pour it in hot water and then drink it.
[215:41.42]Do you have diarrhea too?
[215:42.20]I can fix that.
[215:57.37]Do you mind me asking what you were doing three days ago?
[216:00.01]Hmm.
[216:01.25]That would be the day you visited Mosan Castle.
[216:04.83]Are you asking for an alibi, Miss Drew?
[216:07.71]I'm just trying to confirm what everyone was doing the day that the Book of Apologies was stolen.
[216:11.62]This is worse than Skyrim stuff.
[216:12.68]I know it was stolen.
[216:14.14]No, this is the same as Skyrim.
[216:15.94]Except the camera is zoomed out by about 100%.
[216:19.48]Right.
[216:20.44]But other people might say they were with you.
[216:23.31]I was at Salem District Court all day.
[216:25.21]Let me help you here.
[216:26.09]So unless you're...
[216:28.17]Let me help you.
[216:47.62]Yeah, a little more.
[217:13.18]Right.
[217:14.12]Thank you, Judge.
[217:15.82]Also, I thought you should know there's a car parked outside in the handicapped spot.
[217:21.30]Huh, you don't?
[217:33.93]Say, I'll have it taken care of.
[217:37.25]Goodbye now.
[217:46.77]Can I help you, Ms.
[217:47.91]Drew?
[217:55.10]Can I help you, Ms.
[217:56.24]Drew?
[217:57.30]Right.
[217:58.26]Thank you, Judge.
[217:59.96]Also, I thought you should know there's a car parked outside in the handicapped spot.
[218:05.46]Huh, you don't say.
[218:06.58]I'll have it taken care of.
[218:09.60]Goodbye now.
[218:15.77]Would you guys actually even care if I played the rest of the fucking game like this?
[218:22.89]Yes, can I help you?
[218:27.95]Do you have access to any of the CCTV footage?
[218:32.80]Ah, no, sorry.
[218:35.22]I think that's the judge's... review.
[218:41.14]Did you know that the break-in was faked?
[218:43.48]Sorry, I...
[218:45.97]I'm not following.
[218:47.81]Whoever broke in, entered the evidence.
[218:51.29]Stop moving around.
[218:52.41]I told the judge to lock that door.
[218:54.51]And considering how lax the security is around here, I mean, you just walked right in.
[218:58.57]It could have been anyone.
[218:59.57]I'm just glad you avoided the security.
[219:02.92]It's too loud.
[219:07.28]And then... See you later.
[219:19.41]Sack, sack, sack, sack, sack, sack.
[219:22.07]Okay, now we have... What do we have?
[219:25.84]I forget everything.
[219:27.24]Already.
[219:30.22]We have evidence that... What was it?
[219:35.08]It was the key.
[219:35.68]The AW key.
[219:36.90]But for what?
[219:37.66]What was it for?
[219:38.92]Watch the footage.
[219:41.98]How do I do that, though?
[219:43.76]I wasn't paying any attention.
[219:47.63]judge left get cctv can I help right thank you judge huh you don't say anyone remember break the windows uh search gather alibis VCR the evidence room didn't I try that already
[220:24.03]I don't have, like, an evidence... That's not a tape.
[220:26.33]I can't use it.
[220:32.57]You gotta wait a day.
[220:33.58]He said wait tomorrow.
[220:34.76]So I just go to bed?
[220:36.28]Justice!
[220:36.46]When do we want?
[220:55.19]Sleep a year.
[220:58.48]Okay.
[221:01.62]I forgot to mention.
[221:03.46]I forgot to mention.
[221:05.02]I was speaking with Alicia and she mentioned that she needed to talk to you.
[221:08.64]Shoot.
[221:09.40]I forgot.
[221:09.88]Do you need me to watch... You would?
[221:11.66]I have to watch the shop?
[221:13.46]I know where all the heavy hitters are.
[221:14.98]Uh-oh.

[221:28.47]Gosh.
[221:31.97]Wait, I actually have to sit here?
[221:34.73]Can I open the register?
[221:35.57]Let's see if there's something I can do.
[221:41.82]No, this doesn't count.
[221:42.40]I already did it.
[221:42.92]This doesn't count.
[221:46.08]Go in the back.
[221:47.16]Wait, the secret!
[221:47.82]The secret!
[221:48.44]The secret!
[221:48.74]The secret!
[221:49.00]The secret!
[221:49.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[221:50.46]Interesting.
[221:52.52]Interesting.
[221:54.46]Okay, uh, what is it?
[221:59.18]You're asleep in your crib.
[222:00.06]A book you have in front of you has been passed down in our family for generations.
[222:04.00]It's full of herbology.
[222:05.20]There's so much more I want to tell you, but it will have to wait until you're old enough to understand.
[222:09.94]Be sure to, I heard she's lost you.
[222:12.13]Leaving this letter, you'll find it.
[222:12.99]Remember, you're loved as always.
[222:15.45]Hey, what are you doing?
[222:17.45]That's private.
[222:21.34]That was a breath.
[222:23.33]Am I?
[222:23.75]Adults sleeping in a crib?
[222:26.07]No, that's... As you sleep in your crib.
[222:27.61]No, this is like from like 20 years ago.
[222:30.35]Skyrim AI caught you.
[222:45.52]But I would love to.
[222:46.34]Halt.
[222:46.78]The first woman in Salem to be accused of being.
[222:49.71]Halt.
[222:50.85]Practically.
[222:51.73]This is her book.
[222:53.65]Alright, got the book.
[222:54.25]Your original book.
[222:54.85]Got the original book.
[222:55.79]Are you saying that book is over 300 years?
[222:58.03]Yeah, I know.
[222:59.85]But it's for me.
[223:01.47]Stop.
[223:01.79]Alright.
[223:02.07]We had original witch.
[223:03.61]Original accused.
[223:04.63]Okay.
[223:04.87]Just play Skyrim.
[223:05.97]Why?
[223:06.13]And reading my personal belongings.
[223:07.40]I'll keep my hands to myself next time.
[223:09.48]Don't worry.
[223:31.40]I promise.
[223:32.08]And by the way, I'll take a couple of those steaks, please.
[223:37.20]If you would mind.
[223:37.78]Thank you.
[223:49.73]Actually, you know what?
[223:50.63]I'll take another couple if you don't mind.
[223:52.66]Thank you.
[224:05.18]That was an autoplay YouTuber video.
[224:09.00]Okay.
[224:12.50]Now what?
[224:15.29]There's still clues in that house.
[224:16.49]I have to wait till tomorrow.
[224:17.41]Go to bed.
[224:23.75]It's not my car.
[224:31.86]You can only sleep at night.
[224:33.60]Well, I'm just going to drive back and forth till it's night.
[224:37.52]I'm home.
[224:41.39]I'm ready for bed.
[224:49.01]Can't use that.
[224:51.11]That was worth a shot.
[224:51.81]I didn't know if it was like a secret key.
[224:54.05]Oops.
[224:54.71]Wrong door.
[224:56.94]Oops.
[225:02.58]It's too early for bed.
[225:04.79]God damn it.
[225:05.43]Okay, how do I make it bedtime?
[225:06.71]No.
[225:20.14]Wait, where'd she go?
[225:25.88]Oh, she's in here.
[225:26.36]Progress story to progress time, dummy.
[225:30.24]Still in the same spot.
[225:31.26]I said you used to hang out with the Hathorne house, right?
[225:32.92]Were there ghosts there?
[225:54.88]Do you feel ready to talk about your alibi?
[225:56.78]Where were you?
[225:57.34]I don't even have a passport.
[225:59.41]I don't go anywhere.
[226:00.23]So I wasn't in Austria, if that's what you're thinking.
[226:03.25]And?
[226:04.09]No, I'm talking about the house that burnt down.
[226:07.90]Ah.
[226:09.86]people tell me there's a good reason to suspect you but isn't it obvious I've got a burn mark covering the entire side of my face and like most of my arms what it must be me I'm sorry that happened to you and I'm sorry if people judge you for your burns I prefer it to pity would you tell me what happened there was a fire I was in it wait wait hold on a second
[226:35.14]it's just that so far the main cause for suspecting you of the hathorne fire seems to be this previous one I only want to understand oh okay yeah I was nine it was an old shed and I wasn't supposed to play in it it was kind of a den full of stuff like candles I got stuck inside you can work out the rest
[226:57.11]Is that you?
[227:27.58]Alright, I've gathered alibis for the house.
[227:30.10]Search the house for clues.
[227:33.69]Oh, I'm sick of the house.
[227:36.13]Is it night time yet?
[227:36.81]It's night time.
[227:37.21]No, it's not.
[227:38.69]God damn it.
[227:39.73]Who have I not talked to about their alibi?
[227:41.43]There's one person I haven't spoken to.
[227:49.27]Where were you?
[227:50.99]By the way, where are you?
[227:51.83]Hello?
[227:52.43]Deirdre?
[227:53.30]Help me!
[227:55.08]Deirdre!
[227:56.73]I got you.
[227:58.13]Deirdre one, Nancy zero.
[228:01.23]It's not funny.
[228:02.25]Come on.
[228:03.39]Because now I know how much you care.
[228:05.35]Of course I care, Deirdre.
[228:09.30]Well, anyway.
[228:10.84]I have some information for you.
[228:13.12]Frances Tuttle?
[228:14.40]She's the former owner of Hathorne.
[228:18.10]It all goes back to Frances Tuttle.
[228:20.42]Check it out.
[228:22.29]She took over the Hathorne house estate in 1992.
[228:25.97]Although I found three different marriage announcements in the Salem News, she was never married and never had any biological children.
[228:33.52]The only living heir now is Lauren Holt.
[228:36.52]She met Francis Tuttle and was officially adopted in 2006.
[228:39.52]The judge said there was a will.
[228:43.37]Lauren confirmed that.
[228:46.03]But as far as I can tell, there is no will.
[228:49.05]Nothing was ever filed
[228:51.66]Just repeat the last word of somewhat important sounding sentences.
[228:55.96]It sounds like you're comprehending what you're being told.
[228:59.62]Confused, yeah.
[229:01.78]Sounds bizarre, I know.
[229:06.82]But it's the most likely scenario.
[229:08.66]Likely scenario, it is.
[229:09.83]But why?
[229:10.99]Because in Salem, a historic property is classified differently if it's a ruined,
[229:19.09]That's the way to make somebody that's talking to you about things that they know you don't know for you to make it sound like you actually know it already.
[229:36.50]So you say it at the same time as them.
[229:39.36]And then they are just like, oh, you know this already, but you're just letting me talk about it.
[229:50.27]Thanks for the info.
[229:50.83]Alright, let's go.
[230:06.09]Something has to happen here.
[230:08.01]I need to have something happen.
[230:09.73]I can't exit the game, but I need to.
[230:11.49]Something has to happen right now.
[230:14.70]No herbs, no fucking spices, no food, no pancakes.
[230:18.38]Something.
[230:19.36]Give me, like, a weapon to attack a monster with.
[230:22.28]Like, give me the crowbar and let me hit the monster in the head.
[230:27.25]Okay.
[230:30.21]No, not what herbs do you have.
[230:31.85]Alright, I gotta go back to the house.
[230:52.13]I have that key.
[230:53.57]But why couldn't I use it on it before?
[230:54.93]Because I was told it was going to work?
[231:02.31]God.
[231:07.90]And make sure you check out Nancy Drew.
[231:09.46]And I'm not going to look at what the name of the game is, because I don't know what it is.
[231:13.53]The name of this game that came out two days ago, the new Nancy Drew.
[231:16.09]The Nancy Drew and... The Shadow of Salem.
[231:24.09]No.
[231:24.65]Nancy Drew and the Midnight at Salem.
[231:27.71]Did I get it?
[231:29.01]Something like that.
[231:30.48]The Midnight at Salem.
[231:31.84]Salem Midnight.
[231:34.92]Nancy Drew's Salem at Midnight.
[231:38.10]What's it called?
[231:49.86]Nancy Drew and the Half-Blood Prince.
[231:53.59]Nancy Drew and the Sorcerer's Stone.
[231:56.87]Nancy Drew... Nancy Drew and the Philosopher's Stone.
[232:03.50]How does that make any sense?
[232:05.74]What are you talking about?
[232:07.00]No fucking way.
[232:13.87]No way.
[232:17.47]How do I open this?
[232:38.48]There's a second mirror.
[232:45.26]It's something to do with this.
[232:46.42]This is not even a mirror, though.
[232:48.02]This is a painting.
[232:51.79]Look at it.
[232:52.37]It's like a JPEG.
[232:57.71]Rotate the mirror.
[233:11.20]That's not where I am.
[233:49.57]In the library museum?
[233:58.80]Right click to rotate the mirror.
[234:00.44]That's not true.
[234:04.19]It's the middle room mirror.
[234:06.29]Middle room mirror.
[234:12.42]Mirror by the front door.
[234:15.12]That's not doing anything.
[234:25.44]What else is there for me to investigate here?
[234:27.23]The other house?
[234:45.17]I can't even do anything here.
[234:46.25]It's a 15 hour game, by the way.
[235:00.14]uh somebody said somebody said investigate investigate Uranus
[235:33.98]Right side.
[235:36.20]This doesn't work.
[235:36.78]There's nothing here to put this in.
[235:41.36]But I should be able to do this.
[236:00.42]Use it on the letters.
[236:01.40]I can't do it on the letters!
[236:04.98]I can't.
[236:18.31]I can't do it!
[236:22.71]Where do I put the key?
[236:24.95]Try the lamp.
[236:27.21]What do you mean try the fucking lamp?
[236:36.34]What about back upstairs?
[236:37.00]What the fu- What's going on?
[236:37.98]What's happening?
[236:41.76]Who's f-
[237:33.33]Okay, so I... I don't get it.
[237:39.19]There's probably another one of those desks at the library.
[237:54.57]No, get the fuck out of here!
[237:57.11]Use fast travel?
[237:58.07]There's no fast travel in this game.
[238:11.10]Refund the game?
[238:11.84]Uh, it's been four hours and fifteen minutes.
[238:15.46]That ship has sailed.
[238:16.82]That's not gonna happen.
[238:24.60]let me in here anything I can use where do we see there was aw somewhere before where was it what can you tell me about Lauren Lauren is a piece of work Olivia may pretend so you I've never been in but I've had do you think I don't know maybe if she thought it would help her stay on the ground
[238:59.82]She certainly doesn't want anyone else having it, even if there are historical and legal reasons.
[239:04.74]But, like I said, I don't really know her that well anymore.
[239:09.28]Can you tell me about the accident Mae was in when she was a kid?
[239:12.52]Why do you need to know that?
[239:13.90]How is it important?
[239:15.58]I didn't think it was, but everyone else sees reason to believe Mae is the one who burned Hathorne House.
[239:21.70]So that makes it important, I know.
[239:23.76]It started with the arson, and she has other convictions on her juvenile record as well.
[239:29.36]What happened?
[239:30.36]It was an old shed near our home.
[239:32.42]May was about nine or so.
[239:34.70]She was in it.
[239:36.87]Candles, a lighter.
[239:38.65]I don't know.
[239:39.11]It caught fire.
[239:40.05]She was charged.
[239:41.67]She was so young.
[239:42.67]I feel responsible.
[239:46.03]She shouldn't even have been there.
[239:47.37]And I'm the older sister.
[239:49.41]It's not your fault.
[239:51.19]I'm sorry to just talk.
[239:54.14]I need to open a fucking door so bad before I lose my mind.
[239:57.54]Closed off.
[240:00.16]The new installation is going to be the big reveal that in the new installation the whole time back here we were sacrificing blood and here it is, we're revealing it now.
[240:09.91]That's what it's going to be.
[240:10.55]I know it is.
[240:11.31]The person from Sweden, are you still here?
[240:13.59]That's the big reveal.
[240:14.97]We're working on that project.
[240:17.03]The person that's from Sweden.
[240:19.69]That's what your guess was, right?
[240:21.15]Oh, fuck off.
[240:37.13]What's the name of this game?
[240:38.09]What's the name of the game?
[240:41.33]Nancy Drew A.W.
[240:43.90]Key.
[240:44.12]This is like 50 Nancy Drew, probably, A.W.
[240:46.40]Keys.
[240:49.02]Nancy Drew A.W.
[240:49.96]Key.
[240:56.03]Um.
[241:02.65]What's it called?
[241:03.13]Uh, Salem.
[241:04.77]There you go.
[241:10.94]Okay, hold on.
[241:11.74]Gameplay tips.
[241:18.98]Remove key from decoration at right corner of desk.
[241:26.55]Now that's the first thing we did in the whole game.
[241:34.61]Here we go.
[241:35.09]Open window.
[241:37.71]Wait, this is just a simple walkthrough?
[241:43.04]Walkthrough for Nancy Drew Midnight in Salem.
[241:45.86]Amateur detective.
[241:48.77]Open window, take cover, off desk, read note, zoom in on desk, click lamp, remove key from decoration at right corner, open desk, complete labyrinth puzzle, find the doctor and chase the thief.
[242:01.98]That's the end of the game.
[242:10.21]That's the simple walkthrough.
[242:12.76]Uh... This doesn't exist.
[242:21.68]You think somebody... No one's done an actual walkthrough of the new Nancy Drew game.
[242:24.69]It's been like... It's been two days.
[242:26.29]What do I still... Search the house for clues.
[242:32.81]But fuck, how do I do that?
[242:35.53]Okay, I'm going to save it.
[242:36.49]Hathorne House.
[242:38.18]Hathorne House clues.
[242:42.69]Oh, got it.
[242:43.27]Okay, here it is.
[242:44.33]This video has been removed.
[242:49.39]Hello, everybody.
[242:50.55]Okay, hold on.
[242:54.79]It's an actual playthrough.
[242:55.83]Okay, let me see.

[242:58.93]Please help me.
[242:59.73]Help me.
[243:04.42]I got the jacket.
[243:05.60]This person has so many more things than I do.
[243:11.16]Where'd they get this?
[243:16.28]Where'd they get the... Where'd they get the lighter?
[243:19.00]I need a lighter.
[243:26.04]How'd you get in?
[243:26.48]How'd you get in?
[243:28.06]How'd you get in, though?
[243:31.92]Jacket.
[243:32.70]I need a lighter.
[243:33.23]Where's the lighter?
[243:40.79]Hold on.
[243:42.75]And then what did they... What did they do?
[243:43.81]Did they call Dad?
[243:44.77]No, that's...
[243:52.28]You need to click the leaf on the mirror.
[243:56.19]I already did that.
[244:02.05]Watch the entire thing to know where the lighter is.
[244:05.55]I can't know.
[244:06.17]There's a lighter.
[244:11.41]There's a pumpkin.
[244:27.71]Hold on.
[244:31.21]The lighter.
[244:31.71]Wait, I think I know what the lighter is.
[244:37.72]I'm not even fucking around.
[244:39.34]I'm not even kidding.
[244:40.84]I think I know what the lighter is.
[244:53.57]Lighter in bed.
[244:56.45]No, I know where it is.
[244:58.67]Watch this.
[244:59.05]When do we want it?
[245:15.19]Now!
[245:15.83]What do we want?
[245:17.27]Justice!
[245:18.18]When do we want it?

[246:22.68]Click funny lady.
[246:24.14]No.
[246:46.75]Can't use that here.
[247:52.21]Can't use that Can't use that here
[248:08.95]You came to me in midwinter and made each day feel the brightest.
[248:12.31]Like a lion, I cared for my new cub.
[248:14.69]Something about an ox.
[248:16.65]The month where the spring is.
[248:19.01]Yeah, yeah.
[248:20.48]Remembered our ancestors.
[248:21.86]Now I wish for you to choose.
[248:22.96]Make this house your home.
[248:24.16]We'll be free of this burden.
[248:27.10]And the backside of the letter, the will, is in the house.
[248:32.26]A letter written in Francis Tuttle's own hands.
[248:35.89]Jesus Christ, that scared me.
[248:38.75]Tegan, I was able to rule out some... You need to come here, quickly.
[248:43.50]Uh-oh.
[248:44.18]Something's happened.
[248:45.60]I'll be right there.
[248:47.60]Sorry, I was dragging my eyes across pieces of wood.
[248:51.38]Something happened.
[248:54.83]What happened?
[248:55.65]I was just here.
[248:56.61]Did I do this?
[248:57.43]How did it come to this?
[248:59.77]Uh-oh.
[249:00.73]Sorry, Ned.
[249:02.67]Come on, let's get inside.
[249:16.25]So I didn't tell you everything.
[249:17.89]Of course you didn't.
[249:18.71]You know, it's just... When I started working at the museum, I was curious about our town's history.
[249:25.51]Because I think history is the most important... Of course.
[249:28.67]Well, I found out something about my family.
[249:31.09]About your family.
[249:32.01]We changed our name.
[249:34.02]We used to be Paris.
[249:36.68]Okay.
[249:37.38]Samuel Paris and his daughter Betty were the first accusers of witches.
[249:41.68]They were directly responsible for the execution of numerous people.
[249:46.34]Oh, the head of the AW organization.
[249:48.92]I have a key to that in this AW one.
[249:50.16]My family helped murder their ancestors.
[249:53.12]Which is why I've never told anybody and now everyone knows.
[249:57.25]Why do you think anyone would do this?
[250:00.10]I don't know.
[250:01.44]Maybe it's someone else who wants the Hathorne house.
[250:04.26]No one in AW is going to trust me after this.
[250:07.09]And the evidence is gone.
[250:08.27]All of this is nothing.
[250:11.45]It's going to be okay, Tegan.
[250:13.85]We'll figure it out.
[250:14.77]The shadows of Salem.
[250:23.40]I'm striking while the iron's hot.
[250:24.56]This came out two days ago and I'm
[250:28.52]Yeah, I mean, a lot of streamers are going to play this.
[250:30.88]I wanted to make sure I was here first.
[250:35.40]What do you know about this?
[250:36.22]What do you know about this?
[250:37.77]What do you think about this?
[250:39.71]Would you like a pancake?
[250:40.97]Would you like a pancake?
[250:42.95]Okay, no.
[250:46.81]Frank!
[250:55.05]What are we doing out here?
[250:58.35]Who's calling?
[250:59.07]What?
[250:59.65]I'm calling me?
[251:01.13]Different perspective gameplay.
[251:06.15]Complaining about rationality is inherently irrational.
[251:09.53]We're at the Hardy Boys POV now.
[251:13.53]Not really.
[251:15.07]I'm at the Perry house.
[251:16.67]Someone vandalized it with graffiti.
[251:18.86]Really?
[251:20.22]Turns out the Perrys are descendants of the Parris family.
[251:23.66]A family who was responsible for sending some of the accused witches to their deaths.
[251:28.22]Wow, doesn't she run that justice group?
[251:30.64]Exactly.
[251:31.84]So... Looks like.
[251:34.70]Nope, nothing here.
[251:36.08]We've not found anything.
[251:36.95]I get it.
[251:39.21]Listen, things are a little tense here, so I'm going to stay with Tegan.
[251:42.55]Can you update me if you find anything, please?
[251:46.11]What are we doing out here?
[251:46.87]No problem, partner.
[251:49.11]Western joke.
[251:50.92]mean we haven't really discussed the whole detective partnership thing yet so Frank not a good time right if you're done being awkward I could use your help what who's in alright but who's in Joe's phone whatever you say partner let's finish our search sure sure sure but don't rush we're here to prove the existence of ghosts okay who's in my phone steady equipment should I call my dad how are we doing on that front
[252:17.62]All set.
[252:18.56]I'll use the antenna to search for suspicious cold spots while you move around with the Ghost Wavelength Spectral Analyzer 2.5 and look for disturbances from the other side.
[252:27.57]The Spectral Analy... Anyway, are you sure it actually works?
[252:31.82]Of course.
[252:32.74]I built it myself.
[252:34.76]The device has a top-of-the-line scanner that can detect any disturbances.
[252:38.40]It might not have found anything yet, but you have to stay optimistic about these things.
[252:44.10]This is an $800 paperweight.
[252:47.21]Thoroughly researched.
[252:48.63]This shit's picking up the power lines, bro.
[252:50.33]Alright, let's hunt for ghosts.
[252:58.78]Let's hunt for the blood on the ground that I have to mop up.
[253:11.12]Wait, 15!
[253:12.01]What's that mean?
[253:13.23]15% ghost?
[253:31.86]Ooh!
[253:33.86]Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank!
[253:36.14]Got something!
[253:49.25]I-95 has some traffic on it.
[253:52.13]Hey, there's ghost traffic.
[253:54.89]I can't believe it.
[253:55.53]The Democrats and the Republicans... The ghosts are talking politics.
[254:24.20]It's so painful to control this.
[254:33.80]I feel like it's this one.
[254:40.25]How do I... Oh, give me a break.
[254:41.95]What?
[254:42.37]What does this do?
[254:50.94]What?
[254:53.50]What is one?
[254:54.68]One is... What is two?
[255:17.45]Why are there two different settings?
[255:21.15]Why are there two settings?
[255:32.09]They both do... Worst Amazon order.
[255:49.99]This is something that you get from the sharper image catalog.
[256:16.04]Oh, wait.
[256:19.84]I got it.
[256:20.24]It's right here.
[256:23.44]What the fuck?
[256:33.23]Found a new cold spot.
[256:34.59]You should move over there.
[256:36.23]On it.
[256:42.09]We're just LARPing.
[256:47.64]That's what this is.
[256:51.04]We're just bored out of our fucking minds.
[257:09.71]Well, that looks right.
[257:27.18]Alt-F4.
[257:28.24]This is a cooking minigame.
[257:30.00]No, it's not.
[257:31.32]Not quite.
[257:31.84]Well, it's cooking my brain.
[257:37.49]Cooking with 5G.
[257:53.59]I can't wait till the Scooby-Doo moment happens when we're just out here pretending and just doing live-action roleplay.
[258:01.36]And then a real ghost shows up on the screen, and it starts going crazy, and I go, It's a g-g-g-g-g-ghost!
[258:09.60]Just wait.
[258:16.67]Come on, Frank.
[258:17.93]Stop pulling my leg!
[258:20.59]Frank?
[258:22.49]Where did he go?
[258:24.39]Where's he off to?
[258:25.41]This is a mess.
[258:43.24]No, it's not even close.
[258:47.74]Not even close.
[258:54.82]Oh, this one sucks.
[258:55.64]Hey, do you remember when they did this in Spider-Man?
[259:21.57]I think it's actually this one because we moved.
[259:26.19]Yeah, and then to the right.
[259:27.59]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[259:28.87]You got to move.
[259:29.51]You got to move over here to the right.
[259:30.95]This way.
[259:32.81]This way.
[259:36.85]Almost there.
[259:37.93]Not quite there.
[259:41.82]Oh, we need to step off.
[259:43.92]This is cooking, right?
[259:51.24]God damn it.
[259:54.26]I think I found something.
[260:09.64]He's going to look up at his friend and his eyes are going to be bloodshot.
[260:13.10]He's got huge bags under his eyes.
[260:16.52]I'm going to put them both at zero because I don't understand what the fuck this is even doing.
[260:27.90]Zero.
[260:28.36]Both of you.
[260:30.59]Okay, this is zero.
[260:32.75]This increases...
[260:35.48]I wish I could use, like, the arrow keys, because clicking and dragging this around hurts my brain.
[260:42.46]Oh my god.
[260:44.77]Unbearable.
[260:46.03]I'm about to Alt F4.
[260:48.09]Click, hold, drag up, and to the right.
[260:51.95]Oh, no, you went too far.
[261:10.70]Look at where my mouse is right now.
[261:12.22]I want you to watch this.
[261:12.82]I'm gonna let go.
[261:13.38]Ready?
[261:18.06]You understand how stupid this is?
[261:41.34]I shouldn't have even asked that question.
[261:59.51]No, no, no, no, no.
[262:00.93]Oh my god.
[263:21.45]Joe!
[263:21.81]There's no setting to on amateur.
[263:47.91]There's nothing here.
[263:49.11]What?
[263:49.95]Hey, what's this?
[263:52.67]What is it?
[263:53.09]What is it?
[263:53.49]Is it a ghost?
[263:54.75]It's a garage door opener.
[263:56.31]Well, it seems like some sort of machine.
[264:00.48]But what's a device like this doing in a graveyard?
[264:02.88]I don't know.
[264:04.00]Put both your eyes up to it and press it against it.
[264:05.86]Press the button on it.
[264:06.56]How weird is that?
[264:08.06]Alright, put your equipment down.
[264:09.84]Your plan didn't work.
[264:11.08]Now we're tracking this so-called ghost my way.
[264:13.78]Let's see what else we can find.
[264:15.70]But I just finished setting everything up.
[264:18.95]Fine, fine.
[264:19.91]My eyes are peeled.
[264:35.44]How creepy.
[264:36.10]Putting a motion detector in a graveyard.
[264:38.32]A new addition and fully functional.
[264:40.10]It picks up movement of cemetery visitors.
[264:43.20]It's a smoke detector.
[264:45.76]How creepy.
[264:46.44]Putting a motion detector...
[264:48.53]Alright, what do you want me to do, Frank?
[265:02.29]He's like, oh, we're not done.
[265:04.11]What are you talking about?
[265:14.16]Look for a fakery?
[265:16.25]Look for fakery clues in... Is a fakery a bakery where they just sell you plastic food?
[265:25.68]What is a fakery?
[265:48.90]It's just the le- the less effective Venture Brothers.
[266:22.13]Check out the spooky Jack-o'-lantern.
[266:24.07]Innocent Halloween prank or sinister scare?
[266:27.88]In the dark, it can easily be mistaken for something supernatural.
[266:33.36]You don't even have a camera on your phone?
[266:35.30]Oh my... Wow.
[266:39.53]Not even a camera?
[266:47.42]Here it comes.
[266:48.82]I don't know about this.
[266:50.46]We shouldn't trespass onto someone else's property.
[266:52.67]I don't know about this.
[266:53.89]I don't know about... I don't know... So what do you want me to do then?
[267:01.19]Yes, I know I just did like the Spongebob leans over and said the same thing but with distorted text.
[267:06.06]I know I just did that.
[267:18.65]Rope.
[267:19.61]This was used to make something move to or from the branches.
[267:27.10]Right.
[267:36.23]That's correct.
[267:38.49]Cool.
[267:56.31]Is Joel still watching from in the shower?
[267:59.10]I don't know, maybe.
[268:07.90]If I walked in on my son or daughter playing this game.
[268:22.73]I'd say.
[268:23.27]No, no, no, no.
[268:23.92]Close that.
[268:24.36]Close that.
[268:24.86]Close that.
[268:25.20]Here, here, here.
[268:25.64]Here's like two or three red and stimpy DVDs.
[268:27.22]Watch these.
[268:31.50]Quick.
[268:31.70]Dog food?
[268:31.92]Here, here, here.
[268:32.34]Here's a Nintendo 64.
[268:50.55]There's... Mario 64, Ocarina of Time.
[268:56.59]Play them, play them.
[269:06.60]And they'd say like, Dad, get the fuck out of my room.
[269:09.12]And I'd be like... I...
[269:18.29]No, you get out of my room!
[269:20.15]And I'll start crying and I'll leave the room.
[269:28.13]And then I'm going to fucking plug in the N64 and just, in my own room, I'm going to be playing it by myself.
[269:34.60]Just crying, just... Fucking Nancy Drew.
[269:42.98]Ruining this family.
[269:45.50]Guys, what do I do?
[269:47.97]Somebody tell me.
[269:57.84]Quit the game?
[269:58.38]I can't.
[269:59.74]I can't do it.
[270:19.35]There's a hole in a tree?
[270:27.76]Where's the hole in the tree?
[270:31.78]Smash on rock?
[270:33.50]What?
[270:42.19]Don't tell him.
[270:46.89]What the fuck?
[270:48.63]Really?
[270:49.09]It's a fog machine.
[270:50.71]An affordable but effective fog machine.
[270:52.86]Should be able to cover this whole part of the forest in a layer of mist.
[270:55.28]Give me a break.
[270:56.04]Whatever happened to good old natural hauntings?
[270:58.82]There's nothing natural about our findings here.
[271:01.66]This reeks of foul play.
[271:04.04]Motion detector, fog machine, pumpkin head.
[271:07.80]Did the post not burn down?
[271:11.34]Well, you finally going to admit you were wrong?
[271:14.78]Of course not.
[271:16.16]All we've proven is that there are no ghosts here.
[271:18.90]So you still think ghosts exist?
[271:20.98]But behind you... I think we can't prove they don't not exist.
[271:24.84]Say that again?
[271:26.23]Look, the absence of proof does not mean that we can disprove their existence.
[271:29.61]But what it does tell me is that what Nancy saw was not a real ghost.
[271:33.67]So who has something to gain by setting up a fake haunting?
[271:37.51]Olivia.
[271:38.89]Olivia.
[271:39.93]That's right.
[271:40.33]There's gotta be some evidence linking her to the... Let's go.
[272:07.47]I don't know about this.
[272:08.41]Imagine if you could just ASWD.
[272:20.33]I mean, clearly I'm moving around in the, I'm clearly in a 3D space right now.
[272:27.88]What on Earth?
[272:32.19]I can move around in 3D space.
[272:35.13]What on Earth would I need to do missed controls for?
[272:42.55]And then you hold Alt to have the mouse on the screen.
[272:52.89]Hey, before we do this, shouldn't we call Nancy?
[272:56.95]What?
[272:57.85]Why?
[272:59.32]Because we're a team.
[273:02.54]We should check in with her.
[273:05.08]Let Nancy do her thing and we'll do ours.
[273:07.00]He just teleported.
[273:08.14]He teleported.
[273:08.96]What is our thing, exactly?
[273:11.70]Ghost busting.
[273:17.70]And then we just... We just stuck trash in the place.
[273:25.08]Hey, look.
[273:26.38]A list of mysterious symbols.
[273:29.98]There's a gravestone map on the back.
[273:37.31]If this isn't suspicious...
[273:55.60]I don't see Abigail Hathorne Woodley's grave on here though.
[273:59.02]Would have been too easy.
[274:00.33]No matter, we'll find her.
[274:03.57]Okay, so you're this one.
[274:07.25]What else you got?
[274:09.96]Follow the map.
[274:11.64]Follow the map.
[274:26.40]Fucking remix on you.
[274:34.52]Alright.
[274:35.39]Path to Abigail Hathorne Woodley.
[274:38.77]Dorothy Cromwell.
[274:41.13]Alexander Bell.
[274:43.91]So you're this way from Alexander Bell.
[274:49.78]Let's find... I just tried to WASD after I was very upset about it.
[274:56.37]Alright, let's find that grave.
[274:57.37]Who's this?
[275:10.82]Alexander Bell.
[275:12.26]Okay.
[275:13.34]Look.
[275:15.30]So you are exactly straight diagonal this way.
[275:23.33]You're over there.
[275:24.11]Go.
[275:24.61]Go.
[275:30.38]Nope.
[275:30.76]There's Dorothy Cromwell.
[275:32.94]You're right next to Dorothy Cromwell.
[275:35.50]Are we gonna dig?
[275:38.64]I don't understand.
[275:40.95]What are we doing?
[275:41.47]What's that one over here?
[275:58.42]Uh...
[276:00.14]Is that a box underneath the gravestone?
[276:02.82]Wait, I've got this.
[276:05.64]Picking it up.
[276:06.70]This is good evidence.
[276:07.90]Aren't you glad we broke into the museum?
[276:12.07]But look at this.
[276:14.01]I'm going to go ahead and guess that this will decipher the paper we have in the gift shop.
[276:21.01]Aren't you glad we broke into the museum?
[276:24.29]Alright, here we go.
[276:25.13]Ooh, a secret decoder ring.
[276:27.21]Okay, so... Hmm...
[276:34.28]I like to solve.
[276:37.49]What is... I don't know.
[276:44.28]Donald Duck.
[276:44.84]B.
[276:53.82]H-O is the... Okay, so it's... One, two... Crossed out.
[276:59.57]H-O.
[277:01.51]H-O, uh... Where's H?
[277:06.98]What the hell are these letters?
[277:09.30]J-K... Is this L?
[277:11.70]U?
[277:12.04]V?
[277:13.08]These aren't even... These aren't... Is this pi on here?
[277:17.00]Q... Upside down Q. T-U... Middle Q. X...
[277:23.92]W, W. Trident W, regular W. Y, Z, A, B, Y. S5.
[277:31.97]3, backwards 3.
[277:34.25]This is not real stuff.
[277:35.99]Alright, so H, O. Is there anything that even looks like an H?
[277:48.58]Alright, what about T?
[277:49.60]Is there a T?
[277:50.20]There's a T right here.
[277:51.78]T is...
[277:58.64]Not that.
[278:00.42]It's got to be this shit.
[278:08.34]The toothbrush.
[278:09.68]Where's the toothbrush?
[278:13.17]Is that the toothbrush?
[278:20.75]No, it's this way.
[278:23.53]Key on toothbrush?
[278:32.13]T on... Do the first block.
[278:44.22]H, O, T?
[278:47.24]I can't move the first block.
[278:55.58]The H on the inside circle needs to be lined up with the O on the second circle.
[279:05.97]And then put it on... Where is it?
[279:12.22]This one here.
[279:14.90]No, it's not that one.
[279:15.80]Where is it?
[279:17.20]Who would even make this?
[279:21.56]Jesus Christ.
[279:23.16]Just use a password manager.
[279:28.59]It's the double... It's the two lines.
[279:29.95]Where is it?
[279:34.29]Is it even on here?
[279:37.33]Like that, right?
[279:48.70]Whoa, what?
[279:49.34]Select letters?
[279:50.06]What is going on?
[279:53.72]Rotate... What are you talking about?
[280:01.10]Rotate cipher.
[280:08.20]h-o-t Now the letters are lined up with the symbols Solve how do I solve the puzzle?
[280:31.46]I can't like do anything nothing.
[280:32.75]I can't click anything
[280:36.76]Start the message part after the H-O-T.
[280:43.85]Okay, H-O-T and then the... This symbol ain't even here.

[281:00.64]Why would I ever have ever used a cipher wheel in my life?
[281:07.77]Dude, what?
[281:08.45]We never used a cypher wheel before?
[281:10.31]Yeah, I got one back here.
[281:26.77]Where is this double-pronged one?
[281:36.56]There ain't even a double-pronged one.
[281:38.76]2, 2?
[281:40.24]What the fuck are you talking about?
[281:41.72]That's not... Look at the space there.
[281:45.15]That's 1, 2, 3, 4.
[281:45.89]That's not 1, 2, space, 1, 2.
[281:48.15]Look at that.
[281:48.85]Let me break.
[281:57.05]These are exactly the same.

[289:06.94]It's just nothing.
[289:08.76]Why does this make any sense?
[289:09.68]Nothing, nothing.
[289:12.00]And then T, comb, facing right.
[289:14.97]Okay.
[289:19.55]That's the one, right?
[289:21.05]That's the one right there.

[290:09.69]I got it wrong last time.
[290:10.75]This one is the other way.
[290:12.93]It's just U. And then it's left facing three prongs.
[290:21.22]That's four prongs.
[290:24.18]Left-facing, three prongs.
[290:26.66]Are we correct here?
[290:29.01]Yes, we are.
[290:31.89]It's not four prongs, it's three.
[290:36.35]Alright.
[290:37.43]Left-facing, three prongs.
[290:39.65]Right?
[290:39.87]I need to triple.
[290:45.39]That's four.

[291:24.82]The last one is one prong to the right and the O with the hat on.
[291:37.33]One to the right.
[291:38.17]Where is it?
[291:38.85]One to the left, one to the right.
[291:50.20]There it is.
[291:51.34]Nope, there it is.
[291:52.90]Nothing else, right?

[292:09.49]Cat... Cat what?
[292:11.35]Cat food?
[292:18.82]Cat maintenance?
[292:22.49]Who calls it cat maintenance?
[292:23.95]It's not like a car.
[292:34.54]Okay, this last one is B, and then comb to the left.
[292:39.94]Which one of these is the actual B?
[292:41.20]It's this one.
[292:41.94]Comb to the left.
[292:44.67]How many prongs?
[292:47.35]Five.
[292:49.89]Right there.
[292:50.61]B. Come to the left.
[292:53.79]Five prongs to the left.

[293:48.87]Friend?
[293:54.07]Get stock from... Whoa!
[293:55.41]Oh, it seems you figured it out!
[294:25.47]We're not gonna just say what are you doing in the graveyard This tastes really good a little late for high tea, but it's quality This is not much of a connoisseur
[294:51.91]I'm sorry.
[294:53.01]I don't mean to be rude.
[294:54.05]It's just a bit strong.
[294:55.31]Don't worry about it.
[294:56.05]Lauren's got some of the best stuff.
[294:58.05]She gets it from all over the world.
[295:00.49]Although I usually use the mail order service.
[295:03.69]She is not my biggest fan.
[295:06.72]Imagine just programming in a sneeze.
[295:08.28]Sneeze blood.
[295:09.14]Jo, what's wrong?
[295:36.81]Just blood sporing down from his eyes.
[295:38.47]What did you do to us?
[295:40.79]What evidence do you need?
[295:43.19]She's guilty.
[295:43.87]Okay, wait a minute.
[295:45.07]Who's that?
[295:46.17]Somebody's there.
[295:46.69]Somebody's there.
[295:47.19]I raised up a little theatrical show for tourists and the like, but there's actually a real ghost here.
[295:54.67]Warren saw it.
[295:55.43]No.
[295:56.39]No, you can't have it both ways.
[295:57.99]Joe.
[295:59.77]I am calm.
[296:00.62]Don't say that.
[296:03.05]I heard something.
[296:03.77]Is it me?
[296:04.11]How do you not see that?
[296:04.97]It's like you guys trying to tell me something I can't see on the stream.
[296:32.92]A ghost.
[296:33.96]I don't see it.
[296:34.54]Where is it?
[296:35.24]There.
[296:35.84]Over there.
[296:36.38]It's over there.
[296:37.26]Right there.
[296:38.14]You idiot.
[296:39.88]Are you serious?
[296:41.18]You're serious.
[296:51.35]Okay.
[296:54.81]Well, what is that supposed to mean?
[296:56.93]You never believed.
[296:58.37]Now there's proof.
[297:00.48]It looked real.
[297:01.43]That's all I needed.
[297:02.49]Good.
[297:02.69]Let's get the condensed version.
[297:19.45]Did you track down any new leads for the arsonist?
[297:22.63]Okay, I'll go first.
[297:24.77]So far... Oh, shit.
[297:28.48]So far, the evidence seems to be indicating that we should focus on May, that we should focus on Lauren, that someone is lying about their alibi.
[297:35.27]Well, that's obvious.
[297:36.55]Someone is lying about their alibi.
[297:38.97]Didn't you interview everyone?
[297:41.13]I think it was two people.
[297:43.37]I think it was May, Lauren, and you.
[297:45.75]You're now playing as Nancy Drew.
[298:11.95]nice plan Nancy hey hi it's just I already made it
[298:38.81]So what time did you get home last night?
[298:41.70]I'd like to just eat my breakfast without being interrogated.
[298:44.52]Is that okay with everyone?
[298:47.32]Is it?
[298:48.32]I've already answered a litany of questions from these two.
[298:52.90]You want to ask them.
[298:53.98]I'm sure they'd love to tell you.
[298:55.40]Okay.
[298:57.84]Ow.
[298:58.64]What's wrong with you?
[298:59.68]My hands feel like pins and needles.
[299:02.70]I think I slept on them or... Yeah, me too.
[299:07.27]same what so is anyone going to tell me what happened yesterday
[299:13.73]Uh, they saw it.
[299:14.65]Well, they saw it.
[299:16.23]It?
[299:16.85]An anomalistic paranormal projection.
[299:18.97]You mean a ghost?
[299:19.85]That's exactly what I mean.
[299:21.37]Okay.
[299:22.05]Olivia Ravencroft.
[299:23.25]Olivia saw it.
[299:23.93]Except she claims to have seen Judge John Hathorne, not Abigail Hathorne Woodley.
[299:28.98]I'm gonna be so upset if this is actually the judge with a flashlight on his face and that's the explanation with some fog machines.
[299:37.22]I don't think so, Deirdre.
[299:39.17]It's not an act.
[299:40.57]She was genuinely scared.
[299:42.11]Ergo...
[299:43.31]no sorry not ergo or gut your hands ergot poisoning you really think it's possible mass psychogenic illness by more than one person hallucination lego by echo restriction in the hands and feet pins and needles exactly wait what what is that
[300:04.65]yeah but food or drink intentional we've just been being poisoned this whole time I'd believe it what are you guys talking about we could have been poisoned with ergot poisoned what the symptoms match and it's not without precedent especially here
[300:23.50]it says it here in this book it can actually come from the accusers of the Salem witch trials were exhibiting strange the culmination of the burnt sugars witchcraft in burned pancakes infected by ergot spores and not washing your hands after making food it was also pretty common 300 years ago
[300:40.77]I had an Asahi Super Muscle Builder Smoothie for lunch yesterday.
[300:44.01]I did not eat some sort of Pilgrim-era ripe orange.
[300:48.23]It's not ergot.
[300:50.91]It's like hepatitis A. Sorry to burst everybody's bubble here.
[300:54.49]But all the food we've been eating is my doing.
[300:57.77]It's not some mysterious poisoning.
[301:03.29]You have E. coli.
[301:04.65]I touched raw hamburger meat before I made all your pancakes.
[301:09.05]I visited the Hathorne house.
[301:11.55]And?
[301:11.79]I found Olivia's jacket in plain view.
[301:15.21]Hmm.
[301:16.96]Seems too obvious.
[301:19.36]It is.
[301:20.78]Olivia has been involved with some scare pranks in town.
[301:23.76]Mostly turning up business for her tour.
[301:25.30]But we don't think she's a suspect.
[301:27.12]To be fair, they didn't eat anything you've made.
[301:29.58]She was working.
[301:30.74]Working?
[301:31.40]As was everyone else in town.
[301:34.69]That was a will.
[301:35.07]It was written by Tuttle.
[301:35.87]That's true.
[301:36.55]That's right.
[301:37.23]Okay, access to the CCTV.
[301:37.79]Okay.
[301:57.23]I had to copy that.
[302:29.52]Fucking hate this game.
[302:38.89]Alright, new friend.
[302:44.69]Let's go talk to the judge.
[302:47.19]We're almost at the end of the game.
[303:11.73]This guy's just still standing out here on his car.
[303:14.58]Ladies, ladies, ladies.
[303:17.34]Bye, bye, bye.
[303:19.12]So... You seem to hang out a lot here.
[303:22.84]Well, yeah.
[303:24.93]It's a good vantage point of the whole town.
[303:27.03]Yeah.
[303:28.05]Oh, look.
[303:28.83]I can see the courthouse from right here.
[303:31.37]Can you see it, Nancy?
[303:33.13]I can.
[303:34.15]yeah you can see a lot of buildings from the square so did you see anyone on the day the aw evidence was no what helping her run errands what errand dry cleaning uh look just ask her we will ask her Jake do you know may you know may perry what may yeah why because she's going to be arrested for these crimes by the end of the day what are you talking about that's ridiculous there's wait you know may
[304:01.91]Good conversation.
[304:02.85]I'm trying to condense it a little bit to speed things up.
[304:21.43]What?
[304:22.17]They're skipping through the halls this time?
[304:24.55]I've just realized that this case has taken a turn.
[304:27.90]About time.
[304:29.44]How do you figure?
[304:30.90]Intentional poisoning usually has one goal.
[304:34.12]To eliminate the target.
[304:35.98]Someone was trying to kill us.
[304:38.16]Urgot poisoning at high enough doses ends in gangrene.
[304:42.76]Which, yeah, is pretty bad, but it's not death.
[304:46.20]You really think this was intentional?
[304:48.22]And not some, you know, accidental ingestion?
[304:51.87]If you look at all the evidence, yes.
[304:54.59]Olivia's jacket at the crime scene.
[304:56.07]Spray painting at the Perry House.
[304:57.71]Everyone's obsession to get me convicted.
[304:59.21]You know what all these people have in common?
[305:01.15]What?
[305:01.61]They're women.
[305:02.59]Are you saying they're all witches, or that this is a witch hunt?
[305:06.32]I'm saying it's Salem.
[305:15.92]Where are the protesters?
[305:19.64]Where's my favorite character?
[305:23.48]Case solved.
[305:24.26]It's Salem.
[305:27.57]Yeah.
[305:28.09]Okay, let's talk to the judge.
[305:32.41]Uh-oh.
[305:33.55]The judge has the lawyer present.
[305:34.97]Yes, yes, yes.
[305:42.45]You can use this on the evidence room computer.
[305:45.11]You know where that is, right?
[305:47.68]Yeah.
[305:48.38]I found the pin code here.
[305:49.92]Remember?
[305:50.68]Of course you did.
[305:51.88]Run along?
[305:53.04]Run along.
[305:54.98]The USB stick.
[305:56.90]You know, I just realized I never followed up with you two about what you were doing on the day the AW evidence was stolen.
[306:04.81]Ugh.
[306:05.97]You know, Nancy, this detective thing is really sweet and all, but we are in the middle of something important here, okay?
[306:11.63]What?
[306:12.01]What are you doing?
[306:12.74]Initiating the process of handing over Hathorne House to the state so it can be turned into a museum.
[306:19.86]What?
[306:20.94]It's our only option.
[306:22.75]But you work for Lauren.
[306:24.59]It's her home.
[306:25.69]And I'm getting her an extra 90 days before she's evicted, which is 90 more than she would have had without me.
[306:31.31]So we're a little busy right now, because we need to file this by the end of the day.
[306:35.27]And May Perry?
[306:36.33]What about May Perry?
[306:37.79]Is she being charged?
[306:39.81]I won't discuss this.
[306:41.15]It's an active criminal investigation.
[306:43.57]But from what I've heard, an arrest will happen later today.
[306:47.53]So please.
[306:48.90]Come on, Deirdre.
[306:54.66]Can't use that here.
[306:58.14]Okay, distract me, Drew, so I don't go back in there and smash things.
[307:02.89]With what?
[307:03.77]Tell me some inane detail from your life so I feel better.
[307:08.67]When were you come off badly?
[307:10.14]I know.
[307:11.04]Tell me what Ned said when you told him you saw a ghost.
[307:15.01]Oh, shoot.
[307:15.87]I totally... You forgot?
[307:18.31]You didn't call your boyfriend back.
[307:19.29]Do you even want a boyfriend, Drew?
[307:21.50]Alright.
[307:22.62]There's another girl.
[307:23.58]There's a mystery girl.
[307:24.36]Oh, come on.
[307:25.12]Shut up.
[307:25.44]No, you shut up.
[307:26.22]Maybe.
[307:27.06]You're dumb.
[307:27.64]How dare you?
[307:29.76]That actually sounds like... I know.
[307:31.40]I hate you.
[307:33.66]Oh, it's Dad.
[307:35.12]It's been three days.
[307:36.41]That too.
[307:36.83]You okay?
[307:42.48]how's the case coming along not well I have a bunch of alibis but I'm missing something then there's the book of apologies that's been stolen and the arson and a break-in at the courthouse and the judge called me an idiot slow down what no excuse me what happened there what happened honey who's on your list judge danforth judge danforth
[308:06.32]okay look he's coming on strong trying to pin the crime on a girl without any evidence it's a bit strange unbecoming he's supposed to be impartial but he's really going after this one teenage girl may well look he was like a mentor to me in college we've kept in touch but I do not know all the details of his situation is he in financial trouble no could you make that happen to get a piece of property
[308:34.19]I don't know.
[308:34.97]Which would be ironic, because that's exactly what Judge Hathorne did in 1692.
[308:41.08]But May isn't involved, at least from what I can see, in the question of ownership of the house.
[308:46.10]Could be about the people May is related to.
[308:48.66]Go after her as means to hurt the ones she loves.
[308:52.12]It's extremely unsettling for a judge to do that.
[308:55.23]But it has happened before.
[308:56.55]Is this where we're supposed to piece it all?
[309:02.77]Dad, I'll talk to you later.
[309:05.26]I want to go watch this tape.
[309:14.47]Well, I think Jason is lying to us.
[309:18.17]I'm hoping the CCTV footage will prove it.
[309:21.03]Bad news.
[309:22.05]The footage isn't sorted.
[309:23.63]We need to put it together in a timeline.
[309:25.81]Oh no.
[309:27.19]Hello, I'm Cammy.
[309:28.68]I can see that you're trying to find a suspect.
[309:31.36]Select cameras from the video source list.
[309:33.58]Add footage to the timeline.
[309:35.06]One image per numbered step.
[309:36.74]All of your added images need to have a view of the suspect.
[309:39.08]Good luck.
[309:50.32]Okay, so he came into his office, scratched his head at the window, he went over to the corner, sat in the chair.
[310:03.15]Is that a different person?
[310:05.48]Did he fall asleep at his desk?
[310:23.60]Who's this?
[310:30.56]Who's that?
[310:31.00]Alright, this is the break-in.
[310:37.40]Here's the break-in.
[310:41.23]Alright, there's the judge.
[310:42.87]Comes in.
[310:43.27]He goes into the cabinet.
[310:45.33]He goes over to the computer.
[310:48.25]He leaves.
[310:51.21]Somebody was...

[313:47.39]Do I have here?
[313:52.27]No, I don't.
[313:57.07]All of your added images need to have a view of the suspect.
[314:07.54]Nobody out in the window, right?
[314:08.98]No.
[314:12.86]Alright.
[314:14.88]Alright, Kami, I got you.

[317:17.44]So, what do I have to have for second number four?
[317:21.94]You can see him?

[329:57.77]I'm so glad to hear your voice.
[329:59.35]You have no idea.
[330:00.39]What if it was just Ned?
[330:00.93]Really?
[330:01.59]Yes.
[330:02.23]It could be Ned.
[330:02.73]Why wouldn't I be?
[330:03.69]Well, you know, we haven't really been talking much lately.
[330:07.01]I know, I know, I know.
[330:08.27]It's just... It's just that you're busy with your life, and I've been busy with mine, and... Ned, I've missed you so much.
[330:15.06]Yeah, me too.
[330:16.94]Can we go on vacation, just you and me, together for once?
[330:21.06]Uh, guys, being, getting tested positive for Taco Bell is just, you have high cholesterol.
[330:28.60]That's what that is.
[330:29.78]It's probably Ned.
[330:51.19]Hey, hey, what?
[330:52.19]Is everything okay?
[330:54.52]I don't know, it may seem distant this morning.
[331:11.22]I don't know what to do.
[331:16.18]We'll figure it out.
[331:16.80]I'm sure this is tougher.
[331:20.81]Yeah, I was thinking maybe there was something I should do.
[331:22.98]Try not to do anything rash.
[331:25.06]We'll get to the bottom of this.
[331:27.59]Yeah, thanks.
[331:29.63]Okay, you guys have diarrhea.
[331:33.51]Let's backtrack.
[331:35.23]What did you guys eat and drink around the time... We had tea.
[331:38.55]Tea?
[331:39.01]Yeah.
[331:39.57]We were looking for Olivia Ravencroft and found her.
[331:42.50]She had tea?
[331:43.42]It was matcha.
[331:44.36]Surprisingly good.
[331:45.24]Imagine being out in a graveyard in the middle of the night.
[331:47.88]In the middle of a cemetery?
[331:48.96]In the middle of a cemetery, that's right.
[331:50.20]And a random lady comes up to you and offers you tea to drink.
[331:52.96]And you drink the whole thing.
[331:53.94]Boys, focus.
[331:54.40]Where exactly did Olivia get the tea?
[331:59.17]That's when you start to run.
[332:00.93]She had just bought it from Lauren Holt.
[332:08.39]Keep digging literally, you know, we're not boys.
[332:12.10]It's just part of our name.
[332:14.12]Hmm.
[332:14.90]Whatever you say I Read this read it says
[332:26.57]The Greek god, whatever.
[332:27.37]Or the Roman god.
[332:28.41]Was it Greek?
[332:28.81]Norse?
[332:28.93]Right.
[332:29.13]Okay, bye.
[332:29.41]Thanks for confirming diarrhea.
[332:30.32]Anything else?
[332:55.79]Okay, now we have to go and confirm the person who gave us all diarrhea.
[332:59.49]The source of the diarrhea is in here.
[333:12.03]Lauren, quick question.
[333:14.32]Do you wash the vegetables that you bring into the store before you use them?
[333:19.34]No.
[333:20.10]Okay.
[333:22.07]How's business?
[333:23.91]Slow, thankfully.
[333:25.77]Ugh, I feel awful.
[333:29.97]Just a couple of questions, Lauren, and we'll get out of here.
[333:32.81]Lauren, have you ever had Taco Bell?
[333:39.20]We know what you're doing.
[333:41.76]I'm sorry?
[333:42.34]You're not fooling us.
[333:44.78]This whole New Age act, modern apothecary...
[333:55.27]Yes.
[334:04.92]Aha!
[334:05.91]I knew it!
[334:07.11]Tituba is kind of famous around here.
[334:10.69]She was the first accused witch.
[334:12.61]A slave from the Caribbean owned by Samuel Parris, Elizabeth Parris' father.
[334:18.83]What?
[334:19.57]No way!
[334:20.73]I don't know, but it's not like it comes up in normal everyday conversation, so I've never brought it up.
[334:26.20]I'm not part of that accused witches organization if that's what you're angling at.
[334:31.03]So, you don't get along with Tegan.
[334:33.68]We used to be friends, okay?
[334:36.20]And I don't know why you think this is some sort of amazing revelation.
[334:40.06]We have to play something else.
[334:41.10]Tegan works at the museum.
[334:42.66]We're almost at the end.
[334:43.86]We are right at the end.
[334:46.34]Are you accusing me of burning my house down?
[335:10.08]What do you know about ergot?
[335:28.03]What?
[335:28.53]I had a break-in a few weeks ago.
[335:30.11]Do you have any security camera footage?
[335:32.01]Which wasn't much.
[335:33.56]But the funny thing is, they also took my ergot.
[335:36.92]It's very convenient.
[335:38.26]Of course.
[335:39.24]It treats migraines and cluster headaches.
[335:41.20]It makes you see ghosts and gives you diarrhea.
[335:42.90]It makes you pass out.
[335:44.64]You can also maim people with it.
[335:46.88]Every medicine is toxic in high enough dosage.
[335:50.42]Why do you ask?
[335:52.04]We think that the ghost sightings are related to ergot poisoning.
[335:55.68]I don't know.
[335:58.38]Do you mind if I ask what you ate yesterday?
[336:00.70]I do mind.
[336:02.04]That's kind of personal.
[336:03.72]Give me a... It's okay.
[336:05.00]Personal?
[336:05.31]Just tell us.
[336:06.67]Did you eat any cereal type stuff?
[336:09.49]Like rye bread?
[336:11.03]I'm gluten free.
[336:16.10]What is all this shit?
[336:17.22]You work in a bakery?
[336:28.40]You make... What is it made out of?
[336:30.14]What is that?
[336:30.54]That's like a pound cake.
[336:31.78]This is like cheesecake and pound cake and stuff.
[336:37.47]She doesn't eat it.
[336:37.97]She just makes it.
[336:44.18]Cider donuts.
[336:46.16]Three herb bread.
[336:51.11]How do you know your bread tastes good?
[336:56.85]They're poisoning the water supply.
[337:00.67]You make this bread, but you don't eat it.
[337:03.68]How do you even know it's... Yeah, that's gluten-free.
[337:07.66]Give me a break.
[337:08.34]I don't think so.
[337:09.84]we found a demolition notice in alicia cole's office demolition yeah as in destroying the hathorne house alicia is your lawyer correct yeah so why would she have this document on her desk I have no idea we never talked about any kind of demolition you sure you're not looking to build your dream home it's a great location no I am not looking to build my dream home
[337:42.92]What kind of herb?
[337:45.11]Oh, no.
[337:46.65]Alright, what's it called?
[337:49.83]Ergo?
[337:51.60]Okay, let's go.
[338:06.48]Find source of... Oh.
[338:08.20]Oh.
[338:08.50]Oh.
[338:08.82]Oh.
[338:09.02]I know where to go.
[338:10.11]Excuse me.
[338:10.53]Get out of my face.
[338:11.91]Stop.
[338:12.63]I know where it is.
[338:22.90]Dude, you probably did this.
[338:24.50]Did you hear about the graffiti?
[338:26.16]On the Perry House?
[338:27.32]Well, sure.
[338:28.58]But that was so long ago.
[338:30.58]It was... Who even cares about that stuff anymore?
[338:32.08]It was yesterday.
[338:33.05]Are you kidding me?
[338:34.31]Tegan had the audacity to found the accused witches?
[338:37.53]Trying to profit off the witch trials her own family started?
[338:40.63]Give me a break.
[338:41.29]It was like not even two days ago.
[338:44.07]When you put it that way... I'm glad the neighborhood watch delivers justice to those who deserve it.
[338:49.08]Feels good to have crooks exposed for... What?
[338:51.86]Ages ago.
[338:52.44]No, they're talking about the graffiti on the house, not the witch trials that happened like 6,000 years ago.
[338:59.93]We have to go to the water supply.
[339:35.95]This is it.
[339:36.19]This is it.
[339:37.07]It's this house.
[340:11.63]What?
[340:15.08]Can you go around the house?
[340:16.12]Uh, no I can't.
[340:19.96]Is it actually in the other house?
[340:25.78]Find source of the poisoning.
[340:32.01]Get the crowbar?
[340:39.05]Wait, wait, that's Ergo right there!
[340:41.78]That's ergo right there.
[340:44.08]Look.
[340:44.66]Look at this.
[340:45.77]Move out of the way.
[340:46.39]Look at this green shit.
[340:49.45]That's ergo right there.
[340:50.93]Move out of the way.
[340:57.63]Look.
[340:59.95]Green paint.
[341:06.24]There's green paint all over that door.
[341:15.62]I still don't get this.
[341:16.48]I still don't understand what the fuck I'm supposed to do about this.
[341:18.50]Alright.
[341:19.80]Didger, get out of my life.
[341:32.09]Find the source of the poisoning.
[341:48.44]Where is it?
[341:54.92]I can't go around the house either.
[341:56.26]Is it like a well?
[342:00.68]This is as far as I can go.
[342:01.63]I can't go further than this.
[342:16.68]What the fuck just happened?
[342:58.71]That was strange.
[342:59.50]Okay.
[343:01.33]I got Urgot.
[343:22.37]That's her... I think this is... I think that's her girl.
[343:24.72]No, you're trying to... You're trying to poison us.
[343:35.54]we found this ergot in your water supply using blueprints we found in alicia cole's office alicia alicia has been poisoning you Lauren but why we don't know but we're going to find out run all your faucets shower anything with a spigot for 20 minutes 20 minutes I'm moving no I'm getting my whole house replaced I think I'm just gonna stick to the bottled water that works too
[344:05.38]Go run your water for 20 minutes.
[344:07.58]Your house burned down.
[344:11.84]Are you still just in that house?
[344:14.42]What are you- what?
[344:38.67]She didn't leave a note, no text.
[344:41.43]I came home for lunch from the museum and she was gone.
[344:44.52]Gone.
[344:44.78]I have an idea where she would go.
[344:48.59]Do you have any idea why she would leave?
[344:52.82]juvenile record they published it raining I could have sworn we had it expunged but someone found it the newspaper highlighted an arson incident what a rag yeah and now she's gone missing so when they find her they'll really try to put her away
[345:15.12]May never gave an alibi, because she was protecting someone.
[345:18.94]Do you have any idea who that might be?
[345:21.94]I know what it's like.
[345:24.78]Wait, really?
[345:26.38]Yeah, May doesn't really seem to be Jason's type.
[345:31.05]Before she disappeared, I admit I read through her phone.
[345:35.05]She left it in the living room, and why would she do that?
[345:38.21]They used to be friends when they were younger, but grew apart.
[345:41.41]I guess they still kept in touch.
[345:43.58]Look.
[345:43.92]Look, Tegan.
[345:56.02]I hate to say this, it's not true, because I was the one who set Hathorne House on fire.
[346:01.98]What?
[346:03.10]It was an accident.
[346:04.56]Wait, what?
[346:05.12]I was looking for the will, Francis' will.
[346:07.50]I looked everywhere, and I couldn't find it, so I just started tearing the place apart.
[346:12.08]So you burnt the place to the ground.
[346:12.98]And I was in the storage room, and there were some paint cans, and I knocked over the candle I was using, and it just ignited, like whoosh, burst into flames.
[346:23.33]why didn't may say something do you want the paint on fire I'm so sorry deirdre I'm sorry to both of you I don't know what I was thinking bringing you into this why do you have a candle was going to happen we need to find may please
[346:41.61]Please find her.
[346:43.27]If we find her, if you find her, I will turn myself in.
[346:48.06]You should do that anyway.
[346:49.40]I can't believe this.
[346:51.56]Well, I have it all recorded on my fucking face body cam.
[346:54.22]Were you planning on having May take the fall for this?
[346:57.96]Really?
[346:58.32]After everything, she's... I know.
[347:01.90]I'm sorry.
[347:02.78]I was hoping it would all just fix itself, blow over.
[347:07.34]They have nothing on her, so they can't blame her for it, right?
[347:11.29]I thought we could both just get away from it but she wouldn't give an alibi I don't understand why and I didn't want to risk my work for aw call the police how did it come to this oh boy this is messy deirdre we need to go is there any info you can give us on where she might be I know she has secret hiding places around town but I don't know where they are
[347:35.99]If you go to a certain part of the map and just start spam clicking in random places, maybe you'll be able to find it.
[347:42.17]Oh LOL, what did that say?
[347:45.25]E. It wants pancakes.
[347:59.66]Hey, what's going on?
[348:02.12]Long story.
[348:02.46]Did you just walk into people's houses?
[348:03.54]But Tegan set fire to the Hathorne house and Mae is missing.
[348:06.80]What?
[348:08.12]I need you and Joe to just stay with her and make sure she doesn't go anywhere.
[348:13.66]Our first arrest.
[348:15.81]Private detectives can't arrest people.
[348:18.77]Citizens arrest.
[348:20.89]Wait, you're going out looking for her?
[348:23.11]The storm is getting bad, Nance.
[348:25.19]You want to go arrest.
[348:26.87]I need to set these wrongs right.
[348:28.92]Be careful.
[348:30.30]When am I not?
[348:30.94]Hey, wait for me.
[348:39.83]Nah, I've had enough of this.
[348:42.17]What?
[348:42.97]Us?
[348:43.51]We don't work well together.
[348:45.21]Everything about this is wrong.
[348:47.47]What are you talking about?
[348:48.89]We just solved the crime.
[348:51.17]I called you because I needed you to connect with May to prevent this from happening.
[348:57.00]What the fuck are you doing?
[348:58.14]You've been following me around.
[348:59.88]Just close the door in my face?
[349:00.70]Find clues about Mei's disappearance.
[349:30.99]Can't use that here.
[349:35.89]There are some more things I'd like to look into before... We're gonna go into her room.
[349:44.47]Uh-oh.
[349:46.32]I probably shouldn't be in May's room without an invitation.
[349:50.58]Can't use that.
[349:51.64]Can't use that.
[349:52.62]Hold on.
[349:53.06]Wait.
[349:53.40]I'm supposed to find out... We're supposed to find out why she left.
[349:57.74]And where she is.
[349:59.94]But...
[350:01.31]keep out no parents no adults is still in play I probably what does she have what if she's just in there nobody can go in there what if she's just in there reading a book
[350:34.96]Are you fucking kidding me?
[350:41.09]You'd rather go through her phone than open her door to her room to see if there's anything in there.
[350:47.82]But this is... this is okay.
[350:55.54]Hey, what's up?
[350:56.36]Gonna head out to the house.
[350:57.68]Wait, seriously?
[350:58.30]Wait, it burned.
[350:59.94]Exactly.
[351:00.40]You want to come?
[351:01.93]Hello?
[351:02.27]Uh, no?
[351:05.07]You know I don't go there.
[351:06.63]Uh, right.
[351:07.11]Thought you'd be over it by now.
[351:08.25]The house is barely standing.
[351:10.41]Sorry.
[351:11.63]Just think you'd get over it if you came with once.
[351:15.75]It's a cool place.
[351:16.53]Think about it.
[351:18.17]Hey, you okay?
[351:18.93]I saw the papers.
[351:20.11]What do you think?
[351:21.23]You want to meet up?
[351:22.68]I'm going into hiding.
[351:23.82]Meet me there.
[351:25.18]In this weather?
[351:25.88]Hey.
[351:26.84]Hey, you there?
[351:29.44]I'm coming over.
[351:29.98]Meet me outside, okay?
[351:30.83]I'm going to head out to the... So you're just in the house?
[351:46.49]Isn't that the easiest place?
[351:47.87]Did you just add... Oh.
[352:00.20]Alright!
[352:01.42]Holy shit, Freddy.
[352:04.18]Hey, detective lady.
[352:05.74]You shouldn't be out in the rain.
[352:07.18]It'll ruin your makeup.
[352:08.75]What are you doing out here, Jason?
[352:10.49]I should ask you the same thing.
[352:12.29]I'm looking for Mae Perry.
[352:14.01]She's gone missing.
[352:15.13]You never told me you were friends with Mae.
[352:18.57]Let's talk in the car.
[352:24.08]Mae and I have been friends for years.
[352:27.86]You never mentioned her.
[352:29.48]Since when do I have to tell you everything?
[352:31.64]Do you know she's missing?
[352:33.76]She's not missing.
[352:35.52]She told me she was hiding.
[352:38.08]Where?
[352:39.78]That's a lot of fucking money.
[352:43.44]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[352:44.82]I'm trying to get a print screen of somebody that's driving by.
[352:46.94]No, fuck.
[352:47.96]Come on.
[352:53.02]It's my pleasure for making the year funny for you.
[353:02.34]Thanks for the insane contribution and thank you for watching at all.
[353:08.12]Money aside.
[353:19.55]What the hell is this?
[353:22.93]What the fuck is going on now?
[353:27.79]That was a phylacter which just matched Freddy Dredd's 25,000 bit drop with a 25,000 bit drop.
[353:34.72]Holy crap.
[353:46.43]Hey, Gerber, the McDonald's gift card should be there soon.
[353:48.52]Have a great time.
[353:54.36]Thank... Thank... Thank you so much, Violatory and Freddy, both of you, back to back.

[354:11.49]You gotta be kidding me.
[354:13.21]Oh my god!
[354:16.67]No, no bit and sub fights.

[356:29.01]I'll be at the museum today, as usual.
[356:31.11]Hey, please consider talking to Nancy and Deirdre.
[356:36.45]They're here to help.
[356:37.35]You don't have to say much.
[356:38.25]Just something.
[356:38.73]I'll talk to you later.
[356:39.31]Don't you know I have a phone?
[356:42.73]You know I have the phone.
[356:44.05]Didn't you know that?
[356:44.89]Why are you texting me?
[356:46.47]Oh, this is yesterday.
[356:47.35]Okay.
[356:50.33]Phylactery gave... Oh my fucking lord.
[356:52.80]Holy shit.
[356:56.14]Another $250.
[356:56.44]$250.
[356:56.46]$25,000 bits from Phylactery.
[356:57.58]Tis the season, Jerma.
[357:05.24]Thanks, phylactery.
[357:06.16]That's... You're at another insane amount of fucking money.
[357:10.82]I hope you make a lot of money.
[357:15.27]Holy fuck, dude.
[357:16.11]Thank you.
[357:19.79]Nancy Drew, new money stream.
[357:21.09]I got 35 of these games.
[357:24.79]I'm just gonna play them.
[357:26.98]I bought all the bundles I already told you.
[357:32.64]Alright, so here we go.
[357:33.28]Let's put this down.
[357:36.29]But thank you, everybody, again.
[357:39.57]Sometimes I don't really know what to say, besides that's fucking insane.
[357:42.45]Thank you.
[357:46.89]How do I get out of the car?
[357:50.30]No, I don't want to turn around.
[357:51.46]I probably look so stupid right now.
[357:59.84]Okay.
[358:02.88]Hey, turn off my hazards.
[358:06.94]I'm sorry.
[358:07.40]I don't know how to get out of your car.
[358:13.41]How the fuck do I get out of here?
[358:22.15]Are you okay?
[358:26.57]How's the case coming along?
[358:27.81]Dad, I'm stuck in a car.
[358:32.30]I want to talk about Jason Danforth.
[358:34.80]The judge's son?
[358:36.24]He's a real piece of work.
[358:38.46]I think the judge probably agrees with you.
[358:40.80]I don't know him personally, but I've heard stories.
[358:44.15]He claims that during the time in which the accused witch's evidence was stolen, he was helping Alicia Cole.
[358:50.82]I guess he does work for her.
[358:52.80]Claimants against the Hathorne estate.
[358:55.32]They're trying to take control of the property as reciprocity for their ancestors having that land and life stolen from them by the original Judge Hathorne.
[359:03.65]And that's valid?
[359:05.03]According to the judge, yes.
[359:07.25]But back to Jason.
[359:09.43]Sounds like he's short of cash, constantly.
[359:12.45]But I see him driving a fancy car around town.
[359:15.89]Looks like he lives a pretty comfortable lifestyle to me.
[359:19.40]Money is always a prime motivator.
[359:22.06]He could be receiving money from someone who could commit one of these crimes, or he could have a financial stake in the property.
[359:29.69]She keeps looking up for it when she starts talking.
[359:32.72]Yeah.
[359:33.48]Put it on your little list.
[359:35.04]The queen.
[359:58.96]And the other people.
[360:02.44]Alright, bye dad.
[360:09.20]How do I look in your car?
[360:12.04]How do I search your car?
[360:17.15]Pixel Mike, thanks for five more subs.
[360:20.25]Five more community subs from Pixel Mike.
[360:22.15]On top of the fucking absolute shitload.
[360:31.18]Yeah, this is a nice car.
[360:40.44]Oh, found it.
[360:42.10]Hey, look at this.
[360:44.56]It's his 3D movie ticket for... Yeah, this is what I needed.
[360:50.95]Bingo.
[360:51.83]Yo, what do you think you're doing?
[360:54.21]You can get out of my car now.
[360:58.43]Man, this storm is bad.
[361:00.70]Huh, this is interesting.
[361:03.64]Turns out we were in Austria at the same time.
[361:06.36]Huh?
[361:06.92]WTF?
[361:07.30]What a strange coincidence.
[361:10.12]I...
[361:11.25]You didn't happen to visit Mosam Castle on your trip.
[361:15.11]You did this wrong, Nancy.
[361:17.47]Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy.
[361:18.81]You gotta go in the house first.
[361:22.25]Hang out and just don't bring this up yet.
[361:23.97]Grab a candle holder.
[361:25.11]And be ready.
[361:26.11]Who bought the tickets?
[361:27.63]What?
[361:28.79]You flew first class.
[361:30.81]You didn't pay for that.
[361:31.77]Alicia Cole.
[361:34.76]Well, okay.
[361:35.56]Did you steal all that evidence?
[361:36.44]Did you steal the AW evidence too?
[361:38.92]Explain.
[361:40.04]I want my lawyer.
[361:41.44]Sure.
[361:42.28]Who is your lawyer?
[361:43.48]Alicia Cole.
[361:44.14]Whoa, I've done it now.
[361:46.51]She's not going to help me, is she?
[361:49.15]You can get another one.
[361:51.79]What's the point?
[361:53.43]Yeah, I stole it from my dad's office.
[361:56.25]It was easy enough.
[361:57.16]The guy doesn't lock his door, like, ever.
[362:00.14]And then I gave it to Alicia.
[362:01.46]I don't know where it is now.
[362:03.84]Ugh, my dad's gonna kill me.
[362:06.93]So you flew to Austria to steal the book of apologies.
[362:10.01]So you flew to Austria to steal the book of apologies.
[362:14.07]I want you to say sorry.
[362:16.09]So, you saw me there.
[362:18.61]Yep.
[362:19.89]Does Alicia have the book now?
[362:21.89]Actually, no.
[362:23.77]Where is it?
[362:24.85]It's somewhere safe.
[362:25.97]I need it to... You need to hand it over.
[362:29.17]I don't have it.
[362:31.09]You need to do it now.
[362:32.81]I don't have it, alright?
[362:36.91]Am I supposed to believe Alicia is behind this?
[362:40.66]You want proof?
[362:42.12]Yes.
[362:42.92]I don't have any.
[362:44.26]Why though?
[362:45.70]Alicia knows about my financial situation.
[362:48.08]Once she found out, she squeezed and never let go.
[362:51.14]That's perfect.
[362:51.50]I threatened to tell my father.
[362:53.28]Jason, you committed a crime in another country.
[362:56.80]How bad could it be?
[362:58.10]I know, I know, it's bad.
[363:02.41]Why would Alicia do this?
[363:04.43]Where'd that come from the other side of my head?
[363:08.21]Thank you.
[363:34.17]Thank you.
[363:34.49]Well then, we better hurry up.
[363:54.91]Come on, Deirdre?
[363:56.01]She's not next to me.
[363:56.97]Oh, shit.
[363:57.75]Usually she's right fucking behind me.
[363:59.13]Right.
[363:59.33]Okay.
[363:59.99]Yeah?
[364:00.15]No.
[364:17.32]Well, I know where May is.
[364:19.64]She's underneath Salem.
[364:21.73]Underneath?
[364:22.45]I'm gonna need your car.
[364:23.27]Meet me in the cemetery.
[364:24.37]I need your help to find her.
[364:26.49]Don't follow me.
[364:27.79]Okay, we'll be right there.
[364:29.37]What do we do about Tegan?
[364:31.11]This is more important.
[364:33.10]She's not going anywhere.
[364:34.46]And Frank, don't tell her about May.
[364:37.50]I don't want her trying to come with us.
[364:39.94]This is going to be very dangerous.
[364:41.88]Copy that.
[364:45.39]Hey, we're here.
[364:47.09]What do you need us to do?
[364:48.83]We could get umbrellas.
[364:49.95]I was going to say thank you, Joe.
[364:51.19]I appreciate it.
[364:51.80]I was going to say that right there.
[364:53.22]Thank you, Joe, for saying that.
[364:55.60]Thanks, guys.
[364:56.86]That's the smart one.
[364:57.88]That should be the leader.
[364:58.88]That should be the one that makes decisions around here.
[365:00.72]That should be the one that has the telephones.
[365:02.14]All of them.
[365:07.59]I have one.
[365:07.85]We don't have any flashlights.
[365:08.79]Yeah, we spent all of our money on expensive ghost detecting electromagnetic equipment.
[365:14.29]I don't own a flashlight.
[365:40.12]Where's my lighter?
[365:52.41]Open way into the tunnels.
[365:54.43]Doesn't it... Your phone?
[366:02.17]Fill the dark with light.
[366:03.65]Yes, I know.
[366:15.34]What?
[366:16.70]Hey.
[366:17.70]Who is this?
[366:19.42]Nancy.
[366:19.94]I don't know who this is.
[366:22.10]Sorry.
[366:22.66]Got your number off Tegan.
[366:25.92]Hey.
[366:26.94]Who is it?
[366:29.84]It's Olivia.
[366:31.14]Oh, great.
[366:34.14]Please come talk to me.
[366:37.26]At the shop.
[366:38.28]Yuzumu.
[366:41.07]Sorry for bad spelling.
[366:42.01]Too much cola.
[366:45.85]You don't, like, drunk text people when you drink soda.
[367:11.83]Where are you?
[367:17.88]What's up?
[367:18.26]Hey, Nancy.
[367:19.22]Olivia.
[367:20.20]I'm done with tea.
[367:21.02]Gave it up.
[367:21.46]Now I'm just straight cola.
[367:22.48]All the sugar, all the caffeine.
[367:23.66]I am wired up like a 10,000-volt power line, but I have not seen one single ghost today.
[367:28.39]That's great, Olivia.
[367:29.65]Hey, yes, can you do me a favor?
[367:31.85]I found something, and I, uh... Can you give this to Tegan for me, please?
[367:36.25]We used to be really good friends, and maybe this will... I don't know, remind her of that.
[367:42.66]Can you give it to her?
[367:43.62]I can't do it.
[367:44.30]I'm... I need your help.
[367:49.72]Sure.
[367:50.48]Sure.
[367:51.16]Oh, thank you.
[367:52.86]I just want her to know she isn't alone.
[367:59.03]Okay.
[368:02.05]Alright.
[368:03.55]Thanks for the little tip there.
[368:09.82]And Olivia.
[368:14.32]I know you're doing drugs.
[368:17.90]Just stop.
[368:19.73]Okay?
[368:21.25]Just stop.
[368:23.47]Not the right path.
[368:33.49]Trust me on that.
[368:40.71]But because you are, what do you got back there?
[368:47.36]Out of curiosity.
[368:55.51]Where's Tegan?
[369:00.23]Take a lamp?
[369:03.91]+2, then -2.
[369:13.08]I can't take the lamp.
[369:15.65]I know, it's right in front of me.
[369:17.75]How do we light up dark stuff?
[369:21.20]I think it'll be a mystery the whole day.
[369:47.34]What are you talking about?
[369:50.76]Guys, they're everywhere.
[370:20.82]Those ones are electric.
[370:25.04]Where do you get oil?
[370:27.31]Here.
[370:27.83]I'm going to give it to the hardy boys.
[370:29.91]Here you go.
[370:33.91]No, you're both worthless, apparently.
[370:37.13]What do I do?
[370:37.49]Like, just charge it?
[370:38.55]Do I have to, like, is it like a pull and push?
[370:40.89]Do I have to do that really, really fast, really hard for a little while?
[370:44.15]And then it'll be charged like an LED?
[370:46.13]Or is it an oil lamp?
[370:47.21]Where do I get oil?
[370:47.77]I need oil.
[370:55.10]Put pancake in it.
[370:56.02]Pancake is not fuel.
[370:59.76]There's zero nutritional value in pancakes.
[371:03.46]It's just... It's just sauce that you heat up.
[371:07.62]That has... It's like bread sauce.
[371:09.68]It's not... There's nothing in it.
[371:15.13]I need oil.
[371:27.46]Where is... Where's T?
[371:29.50]She's probably in the secret passage.
[371:34.82]Just light the lantern, please God.
[371:36.76]She's probably sitting on the couch.
[372:00.79]Light the lantern.
[372:01.79]God, please, light the lantern.
[372:03.41]Please, God.
[372:04.65]Light the lantern.
[372:05.53]Please, God.
[372:07.81]Light the lantern.
[372:08.29]I have to go to work in 10 minutes.
[372:17.08]Please.
[372:17.40]Oh, God.
[372:18.00]Please.
[372:20.14]Where do I get oil for the lantern?
[372:21.60]I don't know.
[372:26.61]Just use it at the statue.
[372:28.05]Oh, my God.
[372:28.67]Please, I have to go to work.
[372:29.43]Alright.
[372:42.67]You have to crack the lantern like a glow stick.
[372:51.94]Oh, look at that.
[372:53.93]Alright, let's see here.
[372:55.99]Whoa.
[372:58.27]That's a deep, dark hole.
[373:00.59]Yeah.
[373:00.79]Look at this place.
[373:05.73]Hey guys, hold on one second.
[373:07.53]Hey, I'm at the entrance to the tunnels.
[373:10.33]Jason says Mae is hiding down here and... You're really going down there?
[373:15.34]Everybody's in on it.
[373:16.00]Yeah.
[373:16.72]Look, I haven't been fair to you.
[373:20.42]It's okay.
[373:21.70]Deirdre, I have... You know people that aren't in on this?
[373:23.34]No, it isn't.
[373:24.68]Are the two malnutritioned Hardy boys that don't eat.
[373:27.58]And I'm just so mad that Tegan lied to me.
[373:30.50]Deirdre, I understand, but I really have to go.
[373:33.14]Wait.
[373:33.56]Wait.
[373:40.57]I know we don't see eye to eye on everything.
[373:43.33]The arson that caused Maeve Burns.
[373:45.21]It was me.
[373:47.09]I was supposed to watch her at the house that night.
[373:50.34]We're really getting this right now.
[373:51.40]She left, and I didn't even notice.
[373:54.80]Keegan was with her friends, so I was supposed to watch her.
[373:57.60]I didn't check on her once.
[374:01.38]I was stupid.
[374:02.82]What the what?
[374:03.30]I don't think either of them will ever forgive me.
[374:05.64]You were supposed to.
[374:06.29]You didn't check on her once.
[374:07.45]Just a kid.
[374:09.25]So were you.
[374:11.03]I didn't check on her once.
[374:11.71]One time.
[374:11.91]Were you under anesthesia?
[374:13.17]I don't understand.
[374:13.95]How did you do that?
[374:15.15]It doesn't make any sense.
[374:35.82]Alright, where is this passage?
[374:37.24]Is this a secret passage?
[374:38.74]Does anybody see a secret passage?
[374:40.70]I don't see a secret passage.
[374:43.27]Is there something?
[375:05.16]What's wrong with me?
[375:11.33]It's right there.
[375:11.95]What?
[375:45.72]Well, come on.
[375:47.72]What are you waiting for?
[375:49.22]We'll use our cell phones as flashlights.
[375:51.42]Let's go.
[375:52.42]It's covered with twigs and shit.
[375:56.69]Need to make sure we don't get lost down here.
[375:59.27]One misstep and we might never get out.
[376:01.47]Deep breaths.
[376:02.67]We have directions to follow.
[376:04.77]Everything will be fine.
[376:06.82]How?
[376:07.32]What?
[376:27.36]Oh, okay.
[376:28.24]North.
[376:29.36]Are we going this way or are we going this way?
[376:33.71]So we gotta go north.
[376:38.57]And then... Wait, what are you talking about?
[376:45.27]North.
[376:47.59]North.
[376:48.99]How do I turn?
[376:53.96]Okay, north.
[376:55.72]West.
[376:58.41]South.
[376:59.65]West.
[377:00.65]North.
[377:01.93]North.
[377:02.17]Oh, fuck you.
[377:02.61]You're not helping.
[377:03.63]North.
[377:03.89]West.
[377:04.93]South.
[377:05.31]West.
[377:05.43]North.
[377:05.59]West.
[377:05.79]North.
[377:06.81]North.
[377:09.45]East.
[377:11.68]North.
[377:29.31]East.
[377:30.67]East.
[377:35.08]What the fuck are you talking about?
[377:38.46]Wait, what?
[377:38.92]Hold on.
[377:39.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[377:39.82]Where am I?
[377:43.67]Okay.
[377:44.65]Where am I?
[377:45.65]East?
[377:47.89]Where am I?
[377:48.85]Which east is this?
[377:49.71]This one?
[377:50.17]Where...
[377:54.61]my ears I'm deaf sorry sorry sorry that one got away from me hey did you hear that what
[378:04.91]Ah!
[378:06.03]Ah!
[378:06.59]What is it?
[378:08.35]Jeez!
[378:09.96]Sounds wooden.
[378:11.42]Like a door?
[378:12.88]Alright.
[378:13.54]It's coming from that way.
[378:14.88]But the directions go this way.
[378:17.20]We're on it.
[378:18.26]Why are there bit messages coming from?
[378:19.68]Wait.
[378:19.78]Our cell phones don't work down here.
[378:21.78]And that sounds really angry.
[378:23.59]It could be men.
[378:24.93]There's nothing here.
[378:26.13]What?
[378:26.23]But if we go that way, we might not be able to find our way back.
[378:31.47]Look.
[378:32.81]We'll follow the signs.
[378:34.69]What?
[378:34.87]What?
[378:35.67]Follow the A.W.
[378:39.15]Carbons.
[378:40.27]You are now playing as Frank Hardy.
[378:41.58]Alright.
[379:12.53]Okay, just relax.
[379:30.34]Shoot.
[379:30.70]Get out of the fucking way.
[379:38.45]Carvings.
[379:39.07]Have you seen any AW carvings?
[379:40.69]Darn.
[379:41.51]Darn.
[379:49.85]Oh!
[379:50.03]I don't understand.
[380:29.66]You do it.
[380:30.40]I'll let you take this one.
[380:31.44]Who's behind the door?
[380:32.96]You have five seconds to answer me.
[380:34.82]Or what?
[380:35.74]You're gonna come in guns blazing?
[380:38.20]Deirdre?
[380:38.94]Deirdre, the door's locked.
[380:41.78]I know.
[380:42.56]I locked myself in here.
[380:44.42]Accidentally.
[380:45.32]I need you to get in here.
[380:47.90]I'm being crushed.
[380:49.66]I need your help.
[380:50.82]Fast.
[380:53.94]It's some sort of lock.
[380:56.29]I'm being crushed.
[380:57.83]I think you'd have a lot more to say than that.
[381:02.15]I'm being crushed.
[381:06.67]To create the key, all nine parts need to be properly assembled.
[381:10.21]The resulting icoshadgeron is then inserted into the lock.
[381:16.80]The key is modeled after the common convex type, with twenty triangular faces, five faces meeting at each point.
[381:24.52]The parts can be hidden or distributed to make sure the door is only opened when all owners or parties are present.
[381:30.05]If even a single part is missing, the Ico Shatadron cannot be completed.
[381:37.35]Hold on, Deirdre.
[381:38.43]We're coming.
[381:39.83]Yeah, but how?
[381:41.37]I don't know.
[381:42.19]We gotta find a way.
[382:20.35]Do you want to die?
[382:25.84]Stop!
[382:58.01]This is gonna be... Jeremiah, please hurry, my MacBook is heating up.
[383:04.09]You're gonna be fine.
[383:13.95]No, I want... I need the instructions.
[383:34.62]Out of the way.
[383:37.38]Corner piece... Okay, this big chunky piece, and then... Top left is a regular triangle.
[383:44.98]All the... Right is a regular... Top right, top right, and then top left is a regular triangle.
[383:49.09]Let's try it.
[383:49.51]I can't swap this and this?
[384:18.85]Ow!
[384:19.63]It hurt!
[384:29.99]Oh, both your femurs just broke.
[384:38.55]I need this.
[384:39.27]This is like an it, but it flips like that.
[384:41.67]Ow!
[384:41.75]It hurt!
[384:43.96]I'm coming.
[384:55.08]No, can this go up?
[384:56.98]Okay, hold on.
[385:04.74]Jerma hurry, I have five minutes before my dad gets the what?
[385:19.46]So this is- is it a- does it make a- it makes a circle.
[385:23.66]That's correct.
[385:25.31]So then I need, like, a... Let's see.
[385:27.39]What's... Like, a little wedge over here?
[385:32.63]No.
[385:33.41]One of these down here?
[385:35.49]Will that do it?
[385:38.15]No.
[385:44.36]Is that... No.
[385:45.80]Is that it?
[385:46.36]No.
[385:47.60]Hold on.
[385:52.77]No, it's gotta be like a flat piece going that way.
[385:55.07]Hurry!
[386:05.87]Please, operator, hurry.
[386:08.57]I'm going.
[386:19.27]I came to the middle piece.
[386:21.85]The indents and the balls need to line up.
[386:26.84]Okay.
[386:27.78]I did not even know that there were indents.
[386:30.66]I thought it was just balls.
[386:34.05]I thought it was just balls.
[386:35.13]There are indents.
[386:37.27]I thought it was balls.
[386:40.41]Okay.
[386:41.49]It gets an L. She's going to be just mush when I get in there.
[386:49.67]Alright, so if that's the case, then that don't work up there.
[386:54.63]We need an indent up here.
[386:55.67]No, it's going to be flipped.
[386:59.87]Will that do it?
[387:00.71]That'll do it.
[387:01.35]That'll do it.
[387:03.97]Ball over here.
[387:07.65]I need an indent right there.
[387:08.79]I need a ball over here.
[387:15.19]Oh, would you look at that.
[387:16.73]Got it.
[387:19.04]This one?
[387:20.32]Don't move that piece.
[387:28.39]Oh, fuck yeah.
[387:29.45]Now he gets it.
[387:31.77]He's sick.
[387:32.61]Okay.
[387:33.73]No, it's this one.
[387:37.17]No, it's this one.
[387:41.52]No, it's this one.
[387:50.56]This has to be all of them, right?
[387:55.24]Sure, sure.
[387:56.04]Now let's get on with it.
[387:59.74]Come on, get them all in there.
[388:01.78]Is that even possible?
[388:02.92]I mean, look at them.
[388:04.99]Hey guys, I can't take this much longer.
[388:07.61]What's the hold up?
[388:10.95]Ow, it hurts.
[388:11.97]It might be alive.
[388:12.65]Got it.
[388:13.27]We're coming in.
[388:20.43]Grab her!
[388:21.15]Grab her!
[388:21.59]Uh oh.
[388:26.29]What the heck are you doing down here?
[388:31.13]I'm fine.
[388:32.35]Thanks for asking.
[388:33.77]Are you okay?
[388:34.53]It's a sacrifice board?
[388:36.51]My leg.
[388:38.09]It's just bruised, I think.
[388:40.13]I'll be fine.
[388:41.48]I thought you were dying.
[388:43.92]Well, I could have died if you hadn't saved me.
[388:47.61]I would have been trapped down here for days and starved to death.
[388:51.33]Where are we?
[388:53.03]We're in Hathorne House.
[388:55.08]I came here to try and find the will.
[388:57.16]That was a secret entrance.
[388:59.46]The rain is really doing a number on what's left of the place.
[389:03.36]I managed to get past the stairs, but that bookcase?
[389:06.62]Can't skip.
[389:06.86]Sorry.
[389:07.20]Well, I'm just glad you two were here.
[389:10.46]Who knew that old furniture is really heavy?
[389:13.70]Not for me.
[389:15.10]Man strength.
[389:18.25]Yeah, right.
[389:27.07]It was all.
[389:27.59]Stop.
[389:32.47]Worth it.
[389:33.79]You know, secret room.
[389:36.80]I bet you this is where Abigail was kept.
[389:39.74]Imagine all the bad memories of this place.
[389:42.50]That's not OK.
[389:44.14]Look down.
[389:52.88]Don't move.
[389:54.34]Yeah, I'm not moving.
[389:56.58]It's a puzzle.
[389:57.22]69.
[389:57.90]Captain Obvious, reporting for duty.
[390:00.86]These symbols, I've seen them before.
[390:03.80]Look around, Frank.
[390:04.64]Maybe there's a key or something.
[390:11.93]What's that?
[390:12.65]An electrocute?
[390:13.37]Don't do that!
[390:19.39]Samhain.
[390:21.50]Arrow.
[390:22.26]Is there a book?
[390:29.15]Alright, the book of magic spells.
[390:30.39]Oh, fuck.
[391:34.82]I can't believe he can actually die.
[391:36.38]Okay, so... I gotta read this fucking book.
[392:04.06]We all know life to have as many faucets as there are stars.
[392:08.60]Like water, it flows and changes with... Yeah, that's water.
[392:12.80]Alright, triangle down, water, triangle up, fire.
[392:17.41]Anger and lust, like fire raging, is not enough to find fulfillment.
[392:20.65]Settling down into the stillness and safety of a home, like the resting Earth below.
[392:26.57]Is it people value?
[392:27.35]Yeah, yeah.
[392:27.69]Okay, so down, up, down, up.
[392:36.61]Down up, down up.
[392:37.43]Mm-hmm.
[392:49.24]Aries, the ram, is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between Pisces to the west and Taurus to the east.
[392:55.77]Virgo, the virgin, lies with Leo to the west and Libra to the east.
[393:01.29]It's the second largest monster energy drink in the sky.
[393:05.97]Cool.
[393:07.53]Libra, weighing scales, lies with Virgo to the west and Scorpius to the east.
[393:14.39]Libra is sometimes known as the claws of the scorpion.
[393:18.86]Scorpion, another brand of... Where's the clue, though?
[393:26.18]I don't know.
[393:26.78]Who cares?
[393:27.18]Date?
[393:29.67]Do I have to do... Who are these?
[393:31.65]What is this?
[393:33.49]Balthain?
[393:35.29]Who's Balthain?
[393:37.03]Is there any info?
[393:51.52]Just Google it.
[393:53.92]So I have to pick the sign.
[393:55.20]Okay, so this is water.
[393:58.36]And then pick the symbols of water.
[394:00.78]What are the symbols of water?
[394:01.80]Pisces.
[394:05.04]That's not Pisces.
[394:06.14]That's Gemini.
[394:11.10]Where's Pisces?
[394:20.11]Just open the book.
[394:26.74]Oh.
[394:27.88]Ostara.
[394:28.50]Let's do that first.
[394:30.52]Celebration of the radiant dawn of light ablaze.
[394:32.43]It is the spring equinox in the northern hemisphere where light and dark meets in a perfect balance.
[394:38.17]Belfane marks the halfway point between the spring equinox.
[394:41.69]Okay, so this is the date.
[394:43.46]Ostara.
[394:45.98]Spring equinox.
[394:56.06]Spring?
[394:56.62]What's the, what's the spring equinox?
[395:00.04]Three?
[395:00.50]Is it March?
[395:02.48]April?
[395:02.76]Okay.
[395:09.08]That killed us.
[395:09.58]Is that not the equinox?
[395:16.34]Is that not the equinox?
[395:26.28]321 is Aries.
[395:42.69]Yep, that's right.
[395:43.34]I agree.
[395:43.68]321 is Aries.

[397:17.30]Mm-hmm.
[397:17.74]So even though sometimes she could be stubborn like an ox.
[397:23.27]In the month where spring stirs, I revealed your heritage to you on the day of the Samhain.
[397:29.05]We remembered our ancestors.
[397:30.71]Now I wish for you to choose, make this house your home or be free of its burden.
[397:36.50]Like a lion, you came to me midwinter, cold, cooled.
[397:46.02]By the way, the will is in the house.
[397:48.78]Like a lion.

[398:55.73]Just say it.
[398:56.73]This is not even backseat gaming.
[398:57.91]This is just like we're all sitting behind the Captain Crunch box in a fucking family room with 30 people there and we're all doing it.
[399:03.53]I don't care.
[399:03.87]Who cares?

[399:25.57]One, two... Three... Four...
[399:35.91]Another circle bites the dust.
[399:37.95]Let's figure out the next one.
[399:44.15]This is going pretty good.
[399:46.61]Did you ever... We did it!
[399:52.26]Good job, everyone.
[399:53.80]Yes, perfect.

[400:35.95]Oh.
[400:39.05]Something moved.
[400:39.93]This is so exciting.
[400:41.43]This isn't what I'm talking about.
[400:42.55]This is a true puzzle.
[400:48.16]This is what I'm talking about.
[400:54.86]Well, what is it?
[400:55.90]What is it?
[400:57.12]It's Francis Tuttle's will.
[401:01.50]It's going to be worth, like, $2,100.
[401:03.84]It's right through here.
[401:05.12]I know it.
[401:07.08]May?
[401:08.00]May!

[401:19.81]May?
[401:20.97]Can you hear me?
[401:22.71]My head...
[401:25.12]Is she just down here huffing paint?
[401:26.52]The paint fumes.
[401:27.24]That's why you have to do this in a ventilated area, guys.
[401:33.76]Don't fuck around with spray paint.
[402:07.01]alright um where did you find me Jason your sister is really worried about you I'm sure she is we need to get out of here wait not yet didn't you literally spray paint your teeth on stream what it's a very important book that I need to find I can't leave without it
[402:33.58]I keep trying to think of the context of why you would spray paint your teeth on camera.
[402:39.82]I couldn't tell you what you would do that for.
[402:42.22]Find the book of apologies.
[403:05.50]What the hell do you have all this here for?
[403:21.82]Are you a hamster?
[403:29.73]This is like you're a hamster or you're a bird stole a bunch of shit and hid it away.
[403:36.63]You're a squirrel.
[403:37.99]Oh, great.
[403:38.59]This is gonna be great.
[403:39.56]Okay, hold on.
[403:42.66]Let's see here.
[403:43.48]This is the slots.
[403:46.24]Slot on the top and the right.
[403:50.10]How does that not go in there?
[403:52.66]Oh, it's a circle.
[403:54.34]Circle.
[403:54.96]What?
[403:59.27]Are there any circle slots?
[404:01.01]That's a circle.
[404:01.87]Where are the circle slots?
[404:04.57]Square.
[404:05.23]Circle.
[404:07.34]What is that one?
[404:07.82]Alright, now this one needs square, square.
[404:12.09]Square, square, I need, fuck.
[404:15.69]No, no, get out of here.
[404:16.55]Get out, out, out, out.
[404:17.49]I need a triangle on the edge, and there's only one.
[404:22.07]So it has to be this one.
[404:26.40]Do this edge first.
[404:28.24]Triangle on the left.
[404:29.14]There we are.
[404:34.80]Circle, square.
[404:36.51]Circle, square.
[404:38.35]Circle, square, we don't have one.
[404:42.26]Oh, shit.
[404:44.64]Uh-oh.
[404:45.34]Circle, circle.
[404:46.30]Can I rotate them?
[404:53.26]You can rotate.
[404:58.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[405:02.53]Put it away.
[405:03.11]Stop.
[405:05.05]Stop!
[405:08.57]Oh.
[405:09.37]My.
[405:10.47]God.
[405:13.38]Place... Where's my circle?
[405:21.21]Where's my circle?
[405:24.00]Alright, there's a slot for this.
[405:25.86]Who cares?
[405:26.64]It's wrong.
[405:27.19]It's wrong.
[405:31.15]Now we need a square indent and then a slot.
[405:36.27]We got a square indent and a slot down here, I think.
[405:39.08]Nope, it's some fucking dumbass.
[405:41.64]And then we need a slot, slot, right there.
[405:43.60]Nope, we need a slot, slot, slot over this way.
[405:45.30]That sounds good.
[405:45.92]Then we go over this way.
[405:46.48]We're gonna have a triangle go into here.
[405:59.40]What is it?
[405:59.64]I need a triangle slot.
[406:02.31]Are there not three?
[406:02.97]Where's the triangle slot?
[406:06.73]I'm a fucking stupid fucking idiot.
[406:07.97]Fucking game.
[406:08.57]Fucking dumb.
[406:18.83]Nope.
[406:21.12]Put it away.
[406:35.96]I need... Shit.
[406:43.84]Shit!
[406:49.63]Do the edges first, like you said.
[406:51.01]I know.
[406:53.27]I know.
[406:53.81]That's what I should have done.
[406:55.51]I'll get it.
[406:58.49]Okay.
[406:59.03]Edges first.
[407:00.12]Edges first.
[407:00.64]Did you check Tolton the right?
[407:04.50]Did you check Tolton the left?
[407:15.59]No.
[407:16.63]I need a spot.
[407:22.75]I need an arrow pointing that way.
[407:25.35]And is this an arrow pointing that way and down?
[407:31.17]Arrow pointing that way and down, is it?
[407:41.85]OK.
[407:42.90]Circle pointing right and one pointing down.
[407:46.47]Like this.
[407:48.45]Right?
[407:48.67]Yeah.
[407:48.87]Okay.
[407:50.59]Okay.
[407:53.73]I mean, now I gotta do this at the bottom.
[407:56.07]I need a circle, and I need to circle.
[407:58.27]Just square, square, square.
[407:59.31]Square all around.
[408:00.87]Open squares, by the way.
[408:03.37]Don't ever fuck that up.
[408:05.53]Circle, by the way.
[408:06.89]Circle down.
[408:07.85]There it is.
[408:10.69]Now... We've got...
[408:21.14]No?
[408:21.62]Oh, shit.
[408:25.34]And then this is a... This one's up and then the right.
[408:30.43]Oh, this one maybe this way.
[408:33.19]There's one that's all four.
[408:34.55]This is probably right in the middle somewhere.
[408:35.99]I would say it's probably this one right here.
[408:51.01]Oh, you bet your ass I just... Did I get it?
[408:56.61]Shit.
[408:58.65]I need to switch... Fuck me, no.
[409:03.82]Where does this one go?
[409:09.48]I need a... Left, right, and then one free up top.
[409:15.94]This one here.
[409:18.18]Bingo.
[409:19.32]This is it.
[409:20.52]The Book of Apologies.
[409:22.86]To think I had to follow you all the way from Austria to finally get you back.
[409:27.75]Sounds great.
[409:29.03]Really.
[409:30.67]Are you done yet?
[409:31.55]I can't even pog anymore.
[409:33.13]Let's get out of here.
[409:34.15]Now read the book of apologies.
[409:36.20]Yeah, I think so.
[409:37.22]Nancy, no problem.
[409:38.56]Why though?
[409:39.94]Why did you come down here?
[409:41.10]You know what?
[409:42.02]You don't deserve any of this.
[409:43.35]He doesn't deserve it.
[409:44.25]Neither did those people back in 1692.
[409:45.91]They were victims.
[409:48.57]Thanks.
[409:53.21]Did I win?
[409:54.43]We're just going to leave her down there?
[409:56.21]She can take care of herself.
[409:57.95]Is that what you told yourself when you climbed down and burned our house?
[410:00.35]We left her down there?
[410:01.85]What would have happened if we hadn't come along?
[410:03.67]We have to get this will to the judge by the end of the day.
[410:07.02]Otherwise, this whole thing was for naught.
[410:09.76]And if Nancy and Mae are stuck in those tunnels much longer, we'll have some actual deaths on our hands.
[410:15.40]And if we go down there, it's going to be all of us.
[410:18.37]That's alright.
[410:19.03]We gave her plenty of air.
[410:21.01]Isn't she why Nancy's here?
[410:22.07]The only reason I got into this case was because I care about my cousin, okay?
[410:27.01]But this is what we have to do.
[410:28.85]Believe me.
[410:30.09]I don't want anything to happen to Mae.
[410:32.18]Or Nancy.
[410:33.40]Or Nancy either.
[410:35.40]Fine.
[410:36.46]I'm trying to do one right thing in this whole mess.
[410:39.98]Every turn we've been lied to.
[410:42.30]And I am sick of being lied to.
[410:44.44]Now I am taking this to the judge's office because that is what Nancy would want me to do.
[410:50.14]I may not always be her biggest fan, but if there's anything I know about her It's that she's going to get herself in May out of the tunnel safely At least she's gonna come up with like a fire extinguisher and be pointing it out.
[411:03.01]It's like, I'll do it!
[411:04.75]This is a very large irritant that'll get in your eyes.
[411:10.63]We're not gonna get jumped on?
[411:17.64]Uh... Escape the tunnels.
[411:19.84]Why don't we just lead with them?
[411:21.32]She's dead.
[411:21.76]I think she's dead.
[411:23.20]She's dead.
[411:49.53]Did I just miss a jump scare?
[411:51.01]Wait, we're on drugs.
[412:02.62]Did we get tea fed to us?
[412:05.26]Stop!
[412:06.16]You would think at this point you'd stop drinking tea that people gave you in town.
[412:17.83]But your leg.
[412:18.85]Don't worry about me.
[412:27.92]Well.
[412:28.72]Are we breathing in gas?
[412:41.33]You OK?
[412:44.76]Where are we?
[412:46.58]What is this place?
[412:48.88]Paint huffing, right?
[412:49.66]I can't see a thing.
[413:00.53]Are you okay?
[413:01.77]Please, no.
[413:03.25]What's the matter?
[413:04.23]Why did you bring me here?
[413:05.69]What do you mean?
[413:06.53]You saw them.
[413:07.73]They're coming, and now we're trapped.
[413:10.56]Who's coming?
[413:11.84]What do you mean?
[413:12.74]I know what I did.
[413:15.25]You're going to die here, you know.
[413:19.19]We're about to get the supernatural.
[413:21.07]I'm the witch, I'm the ghost or something, and I've been the ghost the whole game.
[413:26.23]And I, like, burned in the building.
[413:28.27]I burned up in the building, and I'm the ghost, and no one could hear me but you.
[413:33.71]You're the only person I could talk to, and if you go back and play the whole game through, it's like, wow, that's right, nobody ever did address her, ever.
[413:41.77]no one is going to die please you're hurt I need you to calm down because you're the one who knows this place and can help us get out of here why would I help you you don't care what happens to me you couldn't leave it alone everyone has addressed her yeah of course I care people have named dropped her and spoken directly to her like a thousand times I see you now witch they sent you here to hurt me you're the one doing this
[414:15.79]I've been called many things, but I'm not a witch.
[414:19.21]I don't have special powers.
[414:21.09]And even if I did, I would never use them to hurt you.
[414:23.73]No one wants to hurt you.
[414:26.58]You've done nothing wrong.
[414:29.10]Let me help you.
[414:29.96]But I did.
[414:31.60]I did do wrong.
[414:33.84]Everyone knows I did it.
[414:35.66]That's why they... God damn it, I wish I could... And you've been poisoned by the water.
[414:40.59]I wish I could... There's real problem solving.
[414:42.41]The Hathorne House fire wasn't your doing.
[414:44.65]It was Tegan's.
[414:45.61]She told me herself.
[414:47.25]Tegan told you?
[414:48.93]She did, and I believe her.
[414:51.42]Tegan shouldn't be speaking to you.
[414:53.76]Don't listen.
[414:54.36]You don't care about us.
[414:56.60]You just made everything worse.
[414:59.22]Now we're going to die here, and you don't even understand...
[415:03.17]We have to get out of here, otherwise we're gonna keep getting high on glue solvents or whatever they are.
[415:13.29]Taco Bell did nothing.
[415:28.13]I don't think you understand.
[415:30.25]Or want to understand.
[415:31.31]Okay, fine.
[415:34.25]But my leg hurts and I'm still seeing freaky things, so I'm staying right here.
[415:39.30]Good idea.
[415:40.32]Sit tight.
[415:41.52]We'll get out of here soon, I promise.
[415:43.22]She's back.
[415:45.34]She's back.
[415:49.60]Okay, whatever.
[415:50.36]I don't care.
[415:51.81]Like, whatever.
[415:52.43]Who cares?
[415:53.49]Looks like an old oil lantern.
[415:55.51]If only there's a match.
[415:58.09]Oh yeah, I have one.
[416:02.46]Some kind of carved inlay.
[416:04.38]It feels intricate.
[416:09.57]Can we burn the wood?
[416:10.21]No.
[416:13.29]No.
[416:34.11]Need a... Need a light for... Can't make out much.
[416:46.30]Looks like an old oil lantern.
[416:56.99]Was a match.
[417:02.98]Anybody see a goddamn match?
[417:08.00]Where's the lighter?
[417:09.24]We've traded inventories a couple times.
[417:14.63]Should try to light up this cavern as... Should try to... It's not there?
[417:29.72]What?
[417:31.53]Do you have a lighter?
[417:32.85]Do you have a lighter on you?
[417:35.10]Nancy Drew smokes.
[417:37.58]Only when I'm on fire.
[417:38.68]Whatever.
[417:39.32]Some other time, perhaps.
[417:40.74]Sure.
[417:41.20]Okay.
[417:45.48]But I had that lighter.
[417:49.54]Cooked hot dogs, please.
[417:54.65]Still works.
[417:57.59]Should try to light.
[417:59.51]Okay.
[418:02.58]Like the oil barrels on fire?
[418:12.02]Yes.
[418:15.38]This box can open, but I can't force it.
[418:19.66]Even with a set of tools.
[418:22.60]This box can open.
[418:30.68]Abigail Woodley's sign.
[418:33.83]Should look more closely.
[418:35.27]I would love to.
[418:38.82]Oh, you fucking dumb game.
[418:40.54]I accidentally did that.
[418:42.16]Wow, it's beautiful.
[419:02.65]Yeah, why?
[419:03.87]Why do you care that much?
[419:04.77]Shadow of Salem, the title of the game.
[419:08.65]Huh.
[419:34.21]What?
[419:34.43]Whose footprints are these?
[420:00.29]My scar, it hurts.
[420:02.19]It hurt right before the tunnel collapsed, and it hurts now.
[420:06.44]Look, this isn't some ergot hallucination.
[420:08.30]I'm telling the truth.
[420:09.96]And I'm telling you that if you tamper with these bricks, we could be in danger, okay?
[420:14.60]Do you believe me?
[420:17.36]Let's just keep going.
[420:18.52]You know, the effects of ergot poisoning can last a- Forget it.
[420:21.96]I always- The wall seems unstable.
[420:27.77]The wall seems unstable.
[420:38.19]Stuck.
[420:40.65]Stuck.
[420:44.50]Stuck.
[420:46.52]The wall seems unstable.
[420:59.78]You know, I clicked that... I clicked that like 30 fucking times.
[421:06.17]Okay?
[421:08.43]You've seen me click on that.
[421:10.81]A shitload.
[421:14.43]Even when the room was lit up.
[421:22.36]Hmm.
[421:27.97]Like, I tried clicking on this.
[421:29.29]What, it's dark so I can't pick up the item I can see?
[421:31.75]Alright, what do we do?
[421:42.75]I am just a shadow.
[421:44.47]Alright, so where's the shadow?
[421:45.73]We have to make a shadow.
[421:53.30]Let's see what happens if I try to put this back in the wooden panel.
[421:59.35]Now we're getting somewhere just need the other piece This box It's behind one of these stupid ass bricks
[422:57.48]Letter on the- What do you mean, letter scratch on brick?
[423:05.99]What are you talking about?
[423:10.49]Letter on brick.
[423:14.08]I'm just a shadow.
[423:26.02]find the brick in the shadow is that what you want is that what I'm supposed to do hey hey can I have a lighter may yes oh fine I used to come here as a kid with Jason after we were told we couldn't hang out anymore by his father we met in the tunnels and came in here before it was blocked
[423:51.80]Find a different game.
[423:52.30]Just give me an item.
[423:54.14]Okay, good.
[424:16.36]The bricks, they have A-W on them.
[424:18.84]A-W, A-W, A-W.
[424:20.08]Don't touch those, don't touch those, don't touch those, don't touch those.
[424:25.24]This is A-A.
[424:26.40]And this is M. Are there any over here that have that on it?
[425:03.68]You gotta spell out a word.
[425:05.04]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah?
[425:08.63]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah?
[425:11.63]What are you talking about?
[425:13.17]Spell a word.
[425:13.91]Wah, wah, wah, wah.
[425:35.89]I want to... It has to do with... I have to make a shadow.
[425:41.25]I have to.
[425:41.91]Does the candles in here... But that don't matter.
[425:46.01]I don't want to take them out one by one.
[425:48.93]So where is this... There's a brick here somewhere that I can pull up first somehow.
[425:55.08]Not that one.
[425:56.90]Is there one above you?
[426:05.75]The cross marks the desired brick.
[426:08.77]Turn to the wall to the left of May.
[426:11.09]There are two horizontal stripes of bricks.
[426:14.42]Three.
[426:14.76]I gotta copy and paste this in my own thing.
[426:17.04]The cross marks the desired brick.
[426:21.28]What the fuck?
[426:22.06]I have to, like, put this in my own notepad over here.
[426:38.81]Okay.
[426:39.13]The cross marks the desire brick.
[426:40.43]Turn to the wall to the left of May.
[426:41.63]There are two horizontal stripes of bricks.
[426:43.93]Three in each with the initials AW.
[426:45.75]Yeah, I got them right here.
[426:47.27]One, two, three.
[426:48.92]Use a metal object on the middle brick in the upper strip.
[426:56.00]Okay.
[426:59.02]The wall seems un... The wall seems un...
[427:03.12]Three in each with the initials in it.
[427:04.28]We use a metal object on the middle brick and the upper strip.
[427:06.45]A niche will open.
[427:07.65]Take out a thin tablet from there and install it.
[427:14.79]The upper strips.
[427:20.21]AW, AW, AW.
[427:20.61]AA, AW.
[427:20.79]AA.
[427:20.93]That's it.
[427:35.76]I've done this on all of these.
[427:42.55]The upper strip.
[427:43.57]There's nothing I can click on on the upper strip.
[427:49.84]Upper strip?
[427:53.20]What the fuck?
[427:55.78]Use the metal object.
[427:56.98]What do you think I'm doing?
[427:59.48]The wall.
[428:01.37]The wall.
[428:02.61]The wall.
[428:03.96]I clicked there's six bricks I clicked on every single one of them put off the candles you need a reason to do it use note on candle something's different about the note my god you've got to be kidding me
[428:38.05]Light the note on fire.
[428:39.77]And it turns into a new note.
[428:44.91]I am just a shadow.
[428:45.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[428:46.67]Light me on fire.
[428:50.29]Looks like a map of some kind.
[428:52.99]X marks the spot.
[428:58.02]Here goes nothing.
[429:01.68]It's the right one.
[429:04.26]Got it.
[429:05.86]Let's see what... It fits.
[429:10.62]It's covered in a thick layer of dust.
[429:13.43]Should wipe it clean first.
[429:15.77]Oh, would you please?
[429:19.77]Why is everything so dusty in this game?
[429:22.62]It's dusty.
[429:41.37]Are they all gonna be the same height?
[429:42.33]Are they all gonna be the same height?
[429:47.03]I get it.
[430:06.20]This moves these two.
[430:21.89]Almost.
[430:23.79]Almost.
[430:41.26]I feel like after you make like 60 Nancy Drew games...
[430:45.51]You just, at 2019, you're just like, I have no fucking idea what we're gonna do for puzzle number 492.
[430:52.27]That's right, that's right, that's right.
[431:10.05]So what's, what is this?
[431:13.79]Wait, what?
[431:17.51]Supposed to be mirroring this?
[431:20.33]I can't even pull this one up.
[431:39.54]No, come down here.
[431:47.07]That's correct there.
[431:54.71]This moves these two independently.
[432:00.37]Why didn't you just play the older ones?
[432:02.17]Because this is the new one, and I had to PAINFULLY cause myself PAIN first.
[432:29.08]Click on the left side?
[432:30.20]I can't.
[432:32.66]I can only manipulate the right side.
[432:39.88]They have to be in a row like that.
[432:41.84]But wait, there's like, there's two on here though.
[432:45.66]One of them's... Try dusting it.
[432:57.14]Am I actually supposed to be mirroring?
[432:59.10]I have to be mirroring this.
[433:02.64]I'm bringing this down to here.
[433:06.63]Go like that.
[433:09.79]Oh, fuck you.
[433:21.28]This needs to come up.
[433:33.93]This comes up, and then this goes up.
[433:37.59]Oh, you motherfucker, you're right here.
[433:41.29]This comes up.
[433:44.03]No, put these up too.
[433:48.63]I can't go up any higher.
[433:58.02]That was not even accurate, what I was trying to do.
[434:01.26]I wasn't even trying to do that.
[434:12.80]Now where the fuck are we?
[434:45.99]Did I take you three tries to open the door?
[434:48.71]See, boys?
[434:49.93]You look... Dirty.
[434:53.01]I'm fine.
[434:54.15]We need to see the judge.
[434:55.55]Now.
[434:56.37]Yeah, us too.
[434:57.77]We found the... The will.
[434:59.44]No need to recap.
[435:00.72]Let's go.
[435:01.28]Nancy, are you alright?
[435:05.04]Deirdre, can you Frank and Joe wait in the hallway?
[435:08.44]Bugleberry, he's got the reverb now.
[435:10.90]My pleasure.
[435:12.74]Judge, we need to talk.
[435:15.59]What is this?
[435:16.03]I hope he leans into his light and goes, Yes, it looks like it.
[435:20.83]Is it a confession?
[435:22.57]Maybe.
[435:23.43]Judge, we've been here all night.
[435:24.73]I think it's time we retire.
[435:26.59]You're not going anywhere.
[435:27.83]Perp, excuse me?
[435:31.32]Your Honor.
[435:32.58]It's become clear to us that Miss Cole has been the perpetrator of numerous crimes here in Salem, including attempted murder.
[435:41.77]Murder?
[435:42.75]Judge, please.
[435:44.43]That's a very serious claim, Nancy.
[435:47.65]And this is a serious case.
[435:50.15]People's lives hang in the balance.
[435:52.71]This is very cute and all, but we have to do adult things now.
[435:56.05]So run along, everyone, before your PB&Js get cold.
[435:59.72]I have proof.
[436:01.66]And it's all related to the Hathorne house, the future of which rests in your hands.
[436:06.90]so I think you should hear me I want to see the end wait show me the end what you can't be serious judge this is clearly a half-brained attempt to delay what we have determined to be a sound judgment that the half-born house should revert to the state we have spent most of this evening going over all possibilities for how to decide the rightful owner of this house and you've been very adamant that the state should handle it
[436:32.49]We should probably unrush her.
[436:33.43]Well, you see, Alicia's been poisoning Lauren Holt's water supply.
[436:36.03]Why is it so echoey in here?
[436:37.11]It's so echoey.
[437:00.35]Are we underwater?
[437:01.33]It was raining.
[437:01.73]It was raining outside.
[437:18.74]doesn't cause echo inside of your house you said she was poisoned wouldn't that affect anyone's behavior what exactly are you insinuating that you know how ergot affects its victims I'm not answering these questions I happen to be well versed in biology alright but any tidbit of knowledge I have you'll just try to trap me with it
[437:39.50]Use it against me.
[437:41.07]I don't need to do that.
[437:42.63]Because I found, in your office, a map of the Hathorne house- I was- I brought- What?
[437:49.47]I was here, Miss Drew.
[437:51.55]Your coat looks pretty soaked.
[437:54.05]And muddy shoes.
[437:55.90]Water is wet, and it's raining outside.
[437:58.94]Are you satisfied with the ridiculousness of this yet?
[438:01.80]How much longer are you gonna let this go on?
[438:03.56]It all does seem circumstantial.
[438:07.79]Is that all you have, Mr. Drew?
[438:09.51]Can I refund?
[438:11.19]No, I can't.
[438:13.83]You can't play an entire game and then refund it.
[438:18.74]It's almost eight hours of this.
[438:21.86]Oh, yeah.
[438:22.22]I just got a Steam refund.
[438:26.18]I did everything.
[438:29.06]I've beaten the game.
[438:41.04]You can't go to a movie, watch the movie, and after the movie's over, you sit through the credits.
[438:47.92]You even watch the last extra end of credits scene after the credits.
[438:52.34]And you get a refund?
[438:54.63]Hey, I didn't like that movie.
[438:56.03]I want my refund.
[438:56.97]Can you do that?
[439:02.65]No, you can't.
[439:03.41]You can't do that.
[439:04.27]It's final sale.
[439:11.13]If you're annoying enough, you can.
[439:16.45]You can't watch a full movie and then leave and be like, that movie's dead.
[439:19.77]I didn't like that movie.
[439:20.81]I want my money back.
[439:30.78]Just finish it.
[439:34.60]Just finish the game.
[439:38.09]Finish the game.
[439:38.75]Finish the game.
[439:39.29]Just finish the movie.
[439:40.13]Don't walk out of the theater.
[439:41.11]By the way, you walk out of the theater now, you don't get a refund.
[439:44.13]You got to see the whole thing.
[440:02.55]I just ran 60 seconds of ads.
[440:04.01]Are you seeing them?
[440:11.94]Nobody's seeing these?
[440:20.58]There's 32 seconds remaining.
[440:21.77]No one's seeing ads.
[440:28.03]Imagine if ads appeared in the movie.
[440:30.41]Holy shit.
[440:31.33]No one would ever go to the movies.
[440:41.85]Can you, fuck, can you imagine?
[440:49.34]This universe is finite.
[440:50.72]Its resource is finite.
[440:53.18]What I am doing, it requires- It's back.
[440:56.08]Lobster Fest is on at Red Lobster with the most lobster dishes of the year.
[441:00.48]What do you choose?
[441:01.65]How about Lobster Lover's Dream?
[441:03.19]More like a lobster dream come true.
[441:05.21]A butter poached main tail, roasted rock-
[441:10.89]Did anyone actually see an ad?
[441:18.83]No one saw an ad.
[441:25.70]Alicia was responsible for stealing AW evidence from your office.
[441:30.02]Yes, and I also paid $250.
[441:32.77]Oh, that actually hurt.
[441:33.75]I spoke with your son, Jason.
[441:36.05]He claims Alicia forced him.
[441:38.03]I'm sorry.
[441:38.55]Jason is a grown man.
[441:39.71]His actions are his own.
[441:41.57]Alicia lent Jason her car then Jason broke into the evidence room and stole the files.
[441:47.46]I have proof on CCTV Oh
[441:57.79]I'm gonna die.
[441:58.37]Okay.
[441:58.53]He made $250 for this movie.
[442:14.23]And then you got an ad.
[442:15.45]Probably.
[442:17.95]Apologies, Judge.
[442:19.27]But your carelessness is the reason this happened.
[442:22.01]In all probability, Jason... And I've been talking over the whole movie.
[442:25.45]The movie was eight hours.
[442:26.61]I doubt that.
[442:28.57]He barely spends any time with you.
[442:30.27]This is... I've been speaking over the entire movie.
[442:32.87]You left it out for anyone to see.
[442:35.17]If he didn't know the door was unlocked, how hard would it have been to find your key?
[442:40.98]Miss Cole, that's enough.
[442:43.78]Anything else, Miss Drew?
[442:45.72]Yes
[442:46.84]Alicia was behind the theft of the book of apologies.
[442:48.78]Alicia was behind... I've never been to Europe.
[442:51.30]How did you know it was in Europe?
[442:53.75]I heard the judge talking to you about it.
[442:55.61]I never said such things.
[442:56.45]I found plane tickets in Jason's car.
[442:59.51]He admitted to stealing the book of apologies on Alicia Cole's order.
[443:03.81]Order?
[443:05.33]How did I order little Jason to do this?
[443:07.55]Because you like when he cleans your pool or something, right?
[443:11.67]She likes to watch him clean her pool.
[443:13.07]I don't really know.
[443:15.39]To be honest with you, I know he's always looking for money.
[443:19.02]He's in debt.
[443:20.38]Badly.
[443:20.94]A fact Alicia uses to her advantage.
[443:26.06]This is absurd.
[443:27.79]How did he buy a first-class round-trip ticket to Salzburg when the crime occurred?
[443:33.37]Because I pay him for doing errands for me.
[443:35.75]Why is she reading this as if she's reading shit off of a bingo card in a giant auditorium?
[443:41.11]I don't know how we could prove that Alicia... Call the airline.
[443:44.49]You can use the plane ticket reference number.
[443:47.67]Where are the police?
[444:06.62]Where are the police?
[444:07.52]There's been no police at all.
[444:08.80]I doubt that he stole it.
[444:10.48]The credit card company would have notified you for making a large purchase.
[444:14.17]There's nothing here.
[444:15.97]How large is this purchase?
[444:17.49]Is this room being recorded?
[444:18.69]Thousands of dollars, Judge.
[444:25.04]Miss Cole, if this was a court of law and the police were asking for probable cause, I'd be hard-pressed not to allow it.
[444:32.51]Do you have anything to say?
[444:35.09]I told him to get rid of those tickets.
[444:37.47]You know, your honor, your son is a real idiot.
[444:40.85]Truly, a world-class moron.
[444:42.93]He couldn't even follow simple instructions.
[444:45.39]I would have had better luck writing them in crayon.
[444:47.98]And this?
[444:48.92]Seriously?
[444:50.04]This is the kind of stuff I have to deal with?
[444:52.54]I went to law school.
[444:53.76]I have three degrees.
[444:55.37]And now I have... an arsonist, two ghost hunters, a wannabe detective, and her assistant.
[445:04.10]Hey!
[445:05.00]What?
[445:05.66]No!
[445:06.77]trying to screw up my plans.
[445:09.25]All the people you pointed out are the reason you're going down.
[445:13.09]No.
[445:13.85]The reason I am going down is that this stupid little town is stuck in the past.
[445:19.64]Oh, my great-great-great-great-grandmother was accused as a witch.
[445:24.08]I want repayment because I'm lazy.
[445:26.84]She loved me so much that I want this disgusting ruin of a house for free so I can run my luminous vegan tea grocery store.
[445:35.51]That is what pathetic looks like.
[445:37.45]A bunch of whining, moaning little people whose worldview is infinitesimally small.
[445:43.77]Why, Alicia?
[445:45.57]I just told you.
[445:46.31]I just went over it.
[445:47.59]Because I wanted to do something for this town.
[445:50.17]I care about Salem more than anything.
[445:52.07]Sorry, I wasn't listening to anything.
[445:53.05]Olivia's and Tegan's and Lauren's combined.
[445:55.77]I care the most.
[445:56.55]I was locked inside my own head.
[445:58.01]Alicia leveled that old house a long time ago.
[446:00.57]And built new houses!
[446:02.33]With all that land, we could have a real community here!
[446:05.42]We could bring in new business that isn't completely relying on stupid, scary stuff!
[446:10.38]I am talking about economic development on a level which Salem has never even seen!
[446:15.60]And who would be the owner of these new houses?
[446:35.39]Hold that thought for a second.
[446:42.63]Okay.
[446:50.24]Looking at the economic outlook for Salem to see if she was right.
[446:55.30]So there has been a 3.2% growth in payroll growth.
[447:08.21]General Fund, okay.
[447:09.93]Current revenue growth does not keep pace with the growth in current operations costs.
[447:14.17]Growth in property tax revenue year over year ranges between 3.5% and 3%, still below historical levels of 5.5%.
[447:21.64]Lower than predicted compression losses beginning in 2014, 2015 are expected to continue, which improves the city's forecast for essential resource.
[447:30.26]For years two through five of the forecast, PERS rates are assumed to exceed the current advisory board's recommendations.
[447:43.04]Okay, here it is.
[447:44.74]Forecast the general fund.
[447:47.68]What?
[447:50.40]$134?
[447:50.52]That's not right.
[447:55.02]Beginning working capital, current year revenues.
[447:59.12]Beginning working capital, $21.98.
[448:00.24]Current year revenue, $112.
[448:00.94]Total raise was $134.
[448:01.36]That's not...
[448:09.03]This is, is this like a different thing?
[448:11.25]Is that supposed to be a million?
[448:12.75]I think it's million.
[448:17.41]Yeah, value in millions, by the way.
[448:20.54]Value in millions.
[448:21.38]134 million in revenue.
[448:25.42]By the way, 2018 to 2019, $136 million in revenue.
[448:26.98]So.
[448:37.34]Estimated ending working capital is $15.4 million.
[448:39.52]For Salem.
[448:39.80]Okay.
[449:05.42]It's always a housing complex.
[449:08.60]You were going to level the national park to put in condos.
[449:13.38]Money in real estate, you know.
[449:15.57]You have no idea how much money I would have made with condos.
[449:22.25]It's always condos in apartments.
[449:26.33]Fuck that tree.
[449:27.47]Fuck that big tree.
[449:28.76]It's been here for a hundred years.
[449:30.10]I don't care.
[449:30.76]I've lived for a hundred years.
[449:35.48]it doesn't I already have the papers and I am taking them to the state office and none of you are going to stop me you can't cut down that tree yes I can and there'll be big expensive condos and none of the evidence that it's an average price of a condo in Salem Massachusetts
[450:06.43]The detective girl brought up will stick.
[450:08.65]So you admit to all of it?
[450:10.45]Yes.
[450:11.47]Now get out of my way.
[450:15.37]Oh, there's other people in the room.
[450:16.63]Fuck, I didn't even see them.
[450:17.81]This is unbelievable.
[450:22.95]I only wanted to make Salem...
[450:25.61]This is entirely disturbing.
[450:28.24]I am shocked.
[450:29.84]Very shocked at what has occurred here.
[450:32.54]Miss Cole will be held accountable for her crimes.
[450:35.42]I will make sure of it.
[450:36.81]But as much as it pains me to admit, she is right.
[450:41.05]We do not have a legal heir.
[450:43.69]Yes, we do.
[450:49.04]We found the will.
[450:49.64]Okay.
[451:11.26]Well, what about the Hathorne House fire?
[451:13.00]PogChamp.
[451:13.82]Legal air twist.
[451:16.48]Three messages down.
[451:17.92]ResidentSleeper.
[451:18.52]May had nothing to do with the fire.
[451:20.66]You're sure?
[451:21.32]How do you know?
[451:23.50]Because I have a confession from the person who did.
[451:26.92]Really?
[451:31.29]Tegan Perry intentionally set the fire to force out Loren and let the AW organization take over the property.
[451:38.44]That's surprising.
[451:40.08]You say it was intentional?
[451:42.03]Yes.
[451:42.91]I believe it was.
[451:44.19]And I believe that.
[451:45.69]Because anything less than intentional would mean people conspired to withhold information about who was responsible.
[451:52.36]And who might that be?
[451:54.16]You should have just played ace attorney.
[451:58.86]It doesn't matter.
[451:59.74]It doesn't matter.
[452:01.12]It doesn't matter.
[452:02.55]Speed it up.
[452:03.27]Judge, did you ever interview May?
[452:06.23]Get a statement?
[452:06.97]Well, no.
[452:07.65]So you just assumed she was guilty of the crime?
[452:10.67]A case needed to be built.
[452:12.57]There was no case.
[452:13.87]Because you never need... Ms.
[452:15.01]True, I ask that in this office you treat me with respect.
[452:18.92]You deserve as much respect as I'm currently giving you, Judge.
[452:22.23]Nancy, maybe we should... You made this poor girl's life a living nightmare because of something she did when she was young.
[452:29.10]She was a kid, Your Honor.
[452:30.92]Her entire life molded and built and destroyed by an eviction... We're not in a courtroom.
[452:34.78]You're not a lawyer in a courtroom.
[452:35.94]Can you imagine what that does to someone?
[452:37.48]There's no jury here.
[452:38.50]Can you imagine what that does to her family?
[452:41.18]Well, that is a bit unfair.
[452:44.09]You know, this town has a history of judges behaving without sound jurisprudence.
[452:48.94]Thanks for coming, Nancy.
[452:50.06]Tell your father I said hi.
[452:52.16]You would be able to right that wrong.
[452:55.76]Perhaps.
[452:56.98]But my concerns are not unfounded.
[452:59.58]You think Jason is a screw-up now?
[453:02.12]What would have happened if he had been friends with her?
[453:04.98]He is friends with her, Judge.
[453:06.82]What?
[453:08.00]How's that possible?
[453:10.54]Does it be a better audio book?
[453:11.22]Just take away the puzzles and make it audio only.
[453:13.08]I did it.
[453:13.28]Say goodbye.
[453:41.18]Fuck these people.
[453:43.14]I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
[453:45.51]For what?
[453:46.81]We always promised that a secret was the most important thing in the world and we would never break it.
[453:53.93]And I did.
[453:55.23]You saved my life.
[453:56.21]If Nancy hadn't found me, well... Why do I have such blurred vision?
[454:04.35]For a while, I've really screwed up.
[454:07.61]You haven't slept.
[454:09.87]That's true.
[454:10.25]Every time I've tried to go to bed, she goes, Nah, I don't think I'm gonna go to bed.
[454:16.82]I've tried to sleep a few times.
[454:34.06]it's locked it's
[455:10.65]Well, it's over now, so I don't have to put up with you anymore.
[455:15.87]I almost thought you could be trusted.
[455:39.11]Okay, bye.
[455:41.19]Case closed.
[455:44.91]Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
[456:00.25]Imagine playing royalty-free party music at your party.
[456:03.74]Holy shit, how boring is your house.
[456:29.29]Come visit Salem again sometime.
[456:32.05]I always have new herbs and remedies coming into the shop.
[456:35.98]Sounds fun.
[456:36.58]I'll be sure to stop by and Ster the pot.
[456:41.12]And who do we have here, if it isn't the insightful red-headed witch herself?
[456:45.70]I thought you were the only real witch around here.
[456:48.47]There's always room for another witch in the coven, Nancy Gru.
[456:51.99]And I have to say, someone with your magical insights, clairvoyance even, would make a great fit.
[456:58.71]I have always wanted to ride on the Gru.
[457:03.10]Nancy, so glad you're here.
[457:06.08]Dude, crazy party!
[457:07.58]Wild party, man!
[457:08.66]Wild fucking party!
[457:36.70]It was great working with you again.
[457:45.41]Let us know what you think about the detective agency.
[458:10.07]Crazy party I'll be sure to stop
[458:41.49]Get this guy out of the house.
[458:46.17]This guy, someone needs to get this guy out of here.
[458:53.87]Does it sound like your style?
[458:56.01]But if you say so.
[459:00.14]We've had our... Somebody in the bathroom upstairs.
[459:03.44]In the end, you cleared me.
[459:08.31]That's water!
[459:12.03]Oh, dude, what happened up there?
[459:13.66]Dude!
[459:14.20]What the fuck?
[459:17.08]It's a garbage truck!
[459:18.26]Hey, yo, yo, yo!
[459:19.34]Hey!
[459:19.96]The fuck are you doing up here?
[459:38.00]Alright, I have to stop.
[459:45.08]Somebody parked their car in the bedroom.
[459:54.46]I still can't get in here?
[459:55.74]Alright, say goodbye.
[460:09.41]Okay, leave.
[460:10.33]I need car keys.
[460:17.70]What the fuck?
[460:18.22]This crashing sounds.
[460:19.24]No, that's not.
[460:19.88]That's still.
[460:20.82]That's the game.
[460:22.68]I got it.
[460:23.60]Ready?
[460:24.80]Austria.
[460:30.59]Yeah, I know I was just there.
[460:32.65]But I didn't really get to enjoy it much.
[460:35.07]I feel like there's a lot more exploring left to do there.
[460:38.54]It's like trash all over the front lawn.
[460:42.66]He's like, kid, what's all this fucking trash?
[460:45.51]Somebody threw the trash all over the front lawn.
[460:47.69]Okay, that's the end.
[460:48.77]That's the end.
[461:16.97]Oh my god.
[461:25.83]Betty Parris' father, Samuel Parris, was a... Betty Parris' father, Samuel Parris, was a merchant.
[461:36.31]I failed the after-the-credits quiz.
[461:45.38]Oh well.
[462:01.67]What the fuck is this?
[462:02.47]Is this a game?
[462:06.19]It's an ad for the new show.
[462:31.17]What network is this on?
[462:34.21]The CW.
[462:42.17]It says 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[462:45.42]It's apparently 5 out of 10.
[462:53.98]That's not bad.
[462:54.98]That means 50% of all people liked it.
[462:58.52]That's kind of hard to do.
[463:03.76]I'm not going to tell you what happened, but I'm going to type in Nancy Drew, every spoiler.
[463:08.34]I'm just going to read it.
[463:09.92]I don't care.
[463:17.29]Okay.
[463:18.17]How many seasons are there?
[463:22.75]Season.
[463:23.15]Okay.
[463:24.15]Season one, episode 10 ending explained.
[463:26.73]I'm going to watch it.
[463:27.57]Not now.
[463:33.28]Alright, I'm out of here.
[463:34.02]I did not think we were going to play this for eight hours, but that was... You want a rating for Nancy Drew, Midnight in Salem?
[463:46.64]Okay, you know when you go, like, you go to the doctor and you have, like, that pain meter?
[463:49.80]And it's, like, the default face, the smiley face, the really happy face, and then the sort of, like, slightly like owl, and then, like, below is, like, really huge, huge red face screaming owl?
[464:06.29]I would point at somewhere between those two.
[464:11.72]It's my pain index.
[464:23.24]He loves Nancy Drew.
[464:25.81]I played the whole thing.
[464:27.57]By the way, I really hate to tell you guys this, but I own, as of right this second, Nancy Drew, Last Train to Blue Moon.
[464:41.33]Nancy Drew, Sea of Darkness.
[464:42.50]Nancy Drew, Secret of the Old Clock.
[464:44.00]Secrets Can Kill.
[464:45.08]Treasure in the Royal Tower.
[464:46.86]Warnings at Waverly Academy.
[464:57.80]I bought the bundle.
[465:02.86]I mean, you're not going to see it for a while.
[465:08.61]How many games are there in my whole library?
[465:10.39]Oh, 30?
[465:14.21]25 of them are Nancy Drew.
[465:15.49]Team Fortress 2.
[465:16.89]Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2.
[465:20.11]And the Dark Souls, and that's it.
[465:30.39]Alright, that's it.
[465:31.39]That's the end of the stream.
[465:32.40]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[465:34.48]Tomorrow, we're going to try if it works.
[465:39.64]If it doesn't work, then... I don't know.
[465:45.47]We're in non-canon week.
[465:48.81]Welcome to non-canon week, everybody.
[465:51.97]The streams that aren't canon.
[465:58.86]DOS day?
[465:59.36]No, it's going to be Tuesday.
[466:05.13]But me, Star, and Etalyx are going to try to play this game called Tools Up.
[466:13.16]The three of us are going to get together.
[466:15.38]Hopefully we can do it.
[466:16.84]It's a local-only game, so we're going to have to try to finagle with the Steam remote play feature.
[466:24.77]The three tools.
[466:25.87]That's right.
[466:29.53]If it doesn't work, I'll be doing something else.
[466:33.25]That's what we're going to try.
[466:37.13]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[466:40.62]That's going to be the end from me.
[466:41.56]See you tomorrow.
[466:49.29]And if you're sticking around, we've got bits to do.
[466:53.45]Alright.
[467:02.92]Let's go back to... I'm not going to check it.
[467:05.48]I'm not even going to check it because Streamlabs OBS doesn't work.
[467:09.38]So... Why even check it?
[467:17.39]Why even check it?
[467:19.77]Anyways.
[467:21.35]We had a ton of money come in today.
[467:22.59]We had a huge amount of money.
[467:25.69]New OBS.
[467:26.09]I'm going to use regular OBS tomorrow.
[467:29.27]I'm over this.
[467:32.22]But thank you to everybody.
[467:33.24]There was a huge amount of money.
[467:34.14]There was a ton of gifted subs.
[467:35.32]There was a shitload of bits that were throughout the whole stream here.
[467:38.30]Especially there was one part where I was sitting in a car and like a thousand plus dollars I think came in in less than ten minutes.
[467:46.21]Thank all of you.
[467:47.01]Seriously.
[467:49.67]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[467:52.47]But before that, we had 300 bits here from Sad Vega.
[467:56.77]Can I Jerma one guy you by saying that you should play the Mega Man Legends series?
[468:01.42]Mega Man Legends 1, Misadventures of Tronbone, and Mega Man Legends 2.
[468:05.68]They're an amazing series, and still, for what they are, look pretty good.
[468:15.35]I remember playing Mega Man Legends.
[468:18.17]That's the third-person camera one, right?
[468:20.05]I remember they were pretty good.
[468:29.20]Put it on the list.
[468:31.89]Those are for PlayStation, right?
[468:33.85]PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2.
[468:37.02]Put it on the list.
[468:40.60]Atma Starfish, thanks for the thousand bits.
[468:43.04]How is this the stream that you stop using OBS in Streamlabs if this stream isn't canon?
[468:48.90]I know, right?
[468:51.28]But it is.
[468:56.34]It is.
[468:57.50]Thank you for the thousand bits, Atma Starfish.
[469:01.83]Chowder Soup, thanks for 300 bits.
[469:03.39]These hardy boys have a raging clue.
[469:07.71]This is a South Park reference.
[469:12.43]25, Dr. Pepper, thanks for the 250.
[469:13.93]Lizard tier list, when?
[469:16.67]The next time there's a tier list, I hope some of you guys are saving some of your favorites, because I'll be doing it again.
[469:24.08]I have a lot of fun doing those.
[469:25.18]It's just fun to sit there and do it.
[469:29.87]Hey, W-A-S-A-D, thanks to the 250, played Nancy Drew, but not Ace Attorney.
[469:35.16]And then the face like that, I'm right in the middle, but slightly angry about it.
[469:45.34]In the pain index.
[469:54.02]Yeah, I know, but the thing about Ace Attorney is Ace Attorney...
[469:59.60]Ace Attorney is just... Ace Attorney is not like a crappy game.
[470:05.48]This grabbed me and I think a lot of other people in the first two or three hours because it was a little crusty.
[470:13.28]Plus, Ace Attorney does this thing.
[470:16.72]And I know it's a thing.
[470:18.39]It's just a thing that I don't like about it.
[470:20.71]It's just a thing that I don't even know if you can turn it off.
[470:23.71]I tried.
[470:24.21]The game flashes you.
[470:27.89]Act with white flashing every 10 seconds.
[470:34.60]It's like... It happens all the time.
[470:40.61]There is this white camera flash that does the whole screen.
[470:46.37]And you can't turn it off.
[470:47.58]And it actually kind of bothers me.
[470:57.03]You're afraid of the light?
[470:59.23]Why didn't you tell us sooner?
[471:00.31]Well, I told you that I didn't think I wanted to stream it.
[471:05.07]And also, that's a... Just don't look.
[471:10.16]Just blink when those flashes happen.
[471:12.40]Put on sunglasses.
[471:19.96]We would have understood.
[471:21.14]No, I brought this up before.
[471:24.96]I definitely brought this up.
[471:25.68]I remember talking about this.
[471:28.01]I was hoping that when the new remastered version came out that you could turn it off.
[471:34.82]And I don't think it did.
[471:42.90]I remember.
[471:43.50]Yes.
[471:46.04]Nancy Drew is more Jerma's speed.
[471:49.26]Are you sure about that?
[471:50.04]Because I think for at least three or four of the major puzzles in the game, I just looked it up on the guide or asked you what the answer was.
[472:03.56]But thank you, Wild Hubbuddy, for the 500 bits.
[472:07.79]Thank you for letting me be the jermaOneguy with that great Skyrim routine, that great Skyrim bit.
[472:12.63]You proved me wrong.
[472:16.11]Yeah.
[472:17.15]Sometimes I prove people wrong.
[472:22.31]Sometimes I'm proven wrong.
[472:30.02]Happens a lot.
[472:32.68]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[472:36.66]A lot of times you've proven wrong.
[472:38.04]Ban that person for life.
[472:39.02]Oh, it's CAD.
[472:40.42]Oh.
[472:42.66]Still do it.
[472:50.67]Hey, Abomination0, thanks for the 420 bits.
[472:52.81]Why isn't this week canon?
[472:55.93]Um... Well...
[472:59.56]The first stream was not canon.
[473:02.08]Because Joel and I had some scheduling conflicts.
[473:06.13]We were going to play Halo Reach on... The first stream of this week was supposed to be Halo Reach.
[473:13.33]And then, I mean, Joel talked and there was some stuff.
[473:16.24]He was busy with some stuff and we were like, you know what, fuck it, we'll just do it the next day.
[473:19.30]So that was the first stream.
[473:20.20]That was just...
[473:22.06]Like, whatever.
[473:23.02]I'm just going to stream because I still plan to stream.
[473:24.74]I was going to do it, but this is a non-canon stream.
[473:26.72]The next day, me and Joel did play Halo Breach, but it was a disaster.
[473:31.15]It was an absolute 100% completely unmitigated disaster.
[473:35.57]So that was not canon because it was all over the place.
[473:38.93]So I figured, okay, that's two streams in a row that were just sort of just literally throwing up dice in the air.
[473:44.45]So we'll just keep the whole week as non-canon.
[473:50.74]It was very good.
[473:51.96]Let me tell you, do not mistake this.
[473:54.98]These last three streams, I have had an absolute goddamn blast on every single one of them.
[474:01.57]I mean, that doesn't mean that they're canon streams.
[474:05.13]You can have fun in non-canon streams.
[474:10.23]Was Simpsons Hit and Run canon?
[474:13.50]Yeah.
[474:15.49]You know, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[474:16.55]You know how sometimes like you do, there'll be a piece of media that's created and then they make it canon retroactively?
[474:24.02]The Nancy Drew stream is canon.
[474:26.88]Yeah.
[474:34.50]Yes, no, yes it is.
[474:35.58]Yes it is.
[474:36.93]It absolutely is.
[474:43.59]It's happened in the past.
[474:44.59]I can retroactively make it.
[474:45.53]I can make it canon if I want.
[474:51.03]But thank you, Abomination.
[474:52.25]Thanks for the 420 bits.
[474:53.35]Thank you, Dark Soul, for the 250 bits.
[474:57.27]Hope you realize that you streamed this with 500% more viewers than the next person.
[475:02.89]Yeah, but... Do you really think that anyone's gonna stream the new Nancy Drew game?
[475:15.74]It's not like you got... This is not like the Star Wars game coming out.
[475:21.42]It's Nancy Drew Midnight in Salem.
[475:28.01]Apparently at least two people did.
[475:31.33]I did.
[475:31.83]Yeah, but... What?
[475:33.87]So?
[475:38.04]Everyone put the stream in the next tab where they were doing other stuff.
[475:40.83]Yeah, I knew that.
[475:41.67]I did a poll before the stream started.
[475:43.31]I said, is that what you're going to do?
[475:45.15]Most people said, yes, I will have you in a third or fourth tab.
[475:50.49]I said, okay, whatever.
[475:59.00]But no, I know.
[476:04.57]Hey, Silent Serenity, thanks for the 250.
[476:06.34]Holy moly, I know you'd like to talk to Transformer.
[476:10.50]And this is gonna blow your mind.
[476:11.98]It uses the same AI model to generate an infinitely complex text adventure.
[476:17.28]What?
[476:20.26]AI dungeon?
[476:24.19]Are you kidding me?
[476:30.33]Alright, hold on to this.
[476:31.57]Is that for real?
[476:34.64]Hold on to this.
[476:37.72]On the next, like, fuckface comb stream, I'll definitely do it.
[476:40.78]Hey, Spliceable Spleen, thanks for the 500 bits.
[476:49.14]Fuck all the haters, Jerma.
[476:50.86]This stream has been fantastic.
[476:53.06]And your comedy in reaction to this strange game is exactly why I tune in.
[476:57.54]Jerma Hart also, thank you for a solid year of amazing content and entertainment.
[477:03.94]Thank you, Spiceable Spleen.
[477:05.00]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[477:07.12]I don't think there were that many haters.
[477:10.64]I don't think so.
[477:13.48]I didn't get that vibe.
[477:15.28]I didn't get a bunch of, like, people-hater vibe.
[477:18.79]I thought people were having fun.
[477:26.91]I hate you in general.
[477:28.47]Mod that guy.
[477:36.49]Just kidding, don't do that.
[477:39.24]But, thank you.
[477:41.46]No, I had a great time.
[477:43.94]I loved it.
[477:44.30]It was great.
[477:49.18]Hey, Checkers8000, thanks for the thousand bits.
[477:52.40]Is this how you do it?
[477:54.56]That's how you do it.
[477:55.50]That's how you give bits.
[477:56.39]And that was during the insanity.
[477:58.81]Apparently a few hours ago.
[478:05.99]Thank you so much, checkers, and to all of you that just dumped a huge amount of money into the stream.
[478:11.87]Thank you.
[478:14.34]We were so bored that we had to donate to you to get something going.
[478:28.85]Slow update, thanks to the 250.
[478:30.31]Hey, Jerma.
[478:31.73]So glad to watch you embrace your heritage as the son of Nancy Drew.
[478:36.27]Glad you accepted who you are.
[478:37.57]Also, thanks for making 2019 such a great year.
[478:40.49]Ever since I started donating to you this year, I felt happy just talking to you in chat.
[478:45.55]Peace and love, and I can't wait for Jerma Rumble.
[478:47.29]Merry Christmas, happy holidays.
[478:52.98]Talking to you in chat.
[478:56.22]Yeah.
[479:00.01]I have a lot of fun here.
[479:01.93]Sometimes too much fun.
[479:08.48]Sometimes way too much fun.
[479:12.54]But, no, I'd love it.
[479:16.00]It's a lot of fun.
[479:17.14]Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
[479:19.86]Too much fun that your ribcage cracks and your stomach goes up into your esophagus.
[479:28.12]Hernia levels of fun.
[479:30.02]But thank you, slow update.
[479:32.80]Hey, uh, Claudius Knights, thanks for the 500 bits.
[479:35.42]There's no message, just 500 bits.
[479:37.06]Thank you.
[479:43.32]Deus Morte, thanks for the 300 bits.
[479:46.19]You say this is non-canon, but this has been one of my favorite streams of yours this year.
[479:50.29]I don't think I've ever given out this many plus twos.
[479:53.55]I've made it canon retroactively.
[480:00.13]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[480:01.20]Seriously.
[480:02.54]Thank you, Deus Morte.
[480:05.26]Goo Berry Juice, thanks for the 300 bits.
[480:07.62]No message, just 300 bits.
[480:10.46]And we're going to see some very fast credits here.
[480:14.53]They are going to fly by very, very quickly.
[480:20.99]This is going to be... Here they go.
[480:23.58]All of you.
[480:25.26]A lot of you may have just been subbed for the first time today from a community sub.
[480:31.91]Welcome.
[480:34.47]Hopefully not very many of you got cut off from the crash that happened earlier.
[480:38.89]Because remember, we played the game for about 30-40 minutes and then the stream turned off.
[480:48.12]So, sorry to those of you in the first 20-30 minutes of the stream that may have gotten cut off.
[480:55.83]Thank you, everybody, again, for your ridiculous generosity and support of this livestream.
[481:03.68]How's your Razormouse, Jerma?
[481:07.44]Uh, it's not good.
[481:14.11]It's not good.
[481:15.61]I don't like it.
[481:18.91]But, again, thank you.
[481:19.79]Seriously.
[481:21.63]Seriously, seriously, seriously.
[481:24.88]There's still some more bits to do?
[481:28.72]Thank you, MostlyLostForThe250, Hey Jimbo, any... Hey Jimbo!
[481:33.36]Any updates on that community meetup in Vegas?
[481:35.94]Or is that just another thing we can throw under the pile of things that you lied about, Jimbo?
[481:40.55]I mean, you can add it to the list.
[481:52.70]You can add it to the list.
[481:54.52]I would love to do that, but it costs money.
[482:02.45]And I keep spending money on other things for the stream.
[482:10.42]So, not now.
[482:12.10]Not yet.
[482:16.74]I think having a big private party might cost more than I think.
[482:30.77]He spent that money on Nancy Drew.
[482:44.58]That's true.
[482:48.53]Some of your bits have gone to me purchasing Nancy Drew.
[483:00.37]That was an investment.
[483:02.11]I very much resent that.
[483:03.85]Alright.
[483:08.87]I just said that.
[483:10.83]But... People make, like, meme-y jokes about...
[483:16.37]Oh, if I told you that I spent $50 of your bit money at the roulette table, people would be like, oh, gambling?
[483:24.65]What the fuck?
[483:25.71]Oh, he's going to be rolling the dough.
[483:29.45]But that's better than me buying the Nancy Drew bundle.
[483:32.59]Are you sure?
[483:42.52]I wouldn't mind it, to be honest.
[483:49.49]You didn't waste money.
[483:51.67]How is gambling not wasting money?
[483:56.11]Gambling money is wasting money with the hope that one of the times that you're actively wasting the money, that you'll get some money given back to you.
[484:06.94]If you lose,
[484:14.54]Confirmed.
[484:15.56]Nancy Drew complete bundle.
[484:17.90]Worse than going to a casino.
[484:21.12]Confirmed.
[484:33.11]Anyways.
[484:35.29]All jokes aside.
[484:39.34]We'll see you tomorrow.
[484:42.02]Whatever happens tomorrow.
[484:45.91]I'll be live.
[484:47.93]I might get some of that sweet, sweet non-canon.
[484:51.35]I don't know.
[484:53.85]But finally.
[484:55.83]We had, actually, two or three more came in.
[484:59.52]Thank you, CQ, for the thousand bits.
[485:02.54]Less than five minutes ago.
[485:04.66]I still keep re-watching your old videos.
[485:06.90]They're gold.
[485:10.82]That means a lot.
[485:12.18]Because 90% of every video I made on YouTube was designed in a way that I would want people to be able to watch them more than once.
[485:24.13]And maybe still think they're worth watching.
[485:30.24]That's part of the reason why I made some of those videos.
[485:34.18]I want you to be able to watch them again.
[485:35.68]Maybe come back and watch them again if you thought they were funny.
[485:42.57]Maybe you missed an Easter egg that you caught this time.
[485:45.60]Maybe you have to go back and watch the whole thing.
[485:47.90]Check out the Easter egg.
[485:50.52]There was at least two or three Easter eggs in each video.
[485:56.24]No, there's not.
[485:56.68]There's not.
[485:57.10]There's not.
[485:57.46]I know people are going to be like, what the fuck?
[485:58.66]And they're going to go back.
[486:00.10]That's not true.
[486:01.84]Some of them, maybe.
[486:10.54]Acting like you designed the videos.
[486:15.33]I did!
[486:15.69]I sat there for weeks at a time sometimes on some of those videos.
[486:25.59]People always wonder, why did you only make a video, like, once every, like, four or five days?
[486:30.29]I was sitting there in the editing room with the lights off.
[486:33.87]Just trying, what do I want here?
[486:36.29]What do I want to do?
[486:37.45]Is that fun?
[486:38.03]I think that's really funny.
[486:39.73]I like this.
[486:40.21]It's fun.
[486:41.63]And then you go back and you watch the same part of the video, like, four, ten, twenty times in a row.
[486:49.89]And what I'm talking about, I'm talking about, like, a five-second segment that you watch, like, fifty times in a row.
[486:59.59]Not every single video was like that, but most of them were.
[487:05.43]The developing room.
[487:06.19]Snipping each frame of film from your camera in front of your projector.
[487:09.47]That's right.
[487:20.45]The old way.
[487:22.41]That's true.
[487:23.96]But, yes, I'm happy that you still like them.
[487:28.44]Because that's another part of the fear of making videos or making any kind of content is... If people can go back five plus, almost seven, eight plus years ago.
[487:41.75]Like, if somebody comes back and watches these videos, is this still going to be... Does it stand up?
[487:50.53]I don't know.
[487:51.47]Hopefully it does.
[487:59.53]It's part of the thought process, I guess.
[488:03.21]But, uh, thank you, CQ.
[488:04.73]And thank you, CQ, again, for another 500 bits.
[488:10.61]They say for the Nancy Drew Fund.
[488:21.36]By every Nancy Drew game.
[488:27.42]See you tomorrow.
[488:33.16]Have a wonderful night.
[488:34.96]Nancy Drew.
[488:35.66]The newest.
[488:38.44]We're going newest and then down to oldest.
[488:40.61]Good night, guys.
[488:45.09]I'll see you tomorrow.
