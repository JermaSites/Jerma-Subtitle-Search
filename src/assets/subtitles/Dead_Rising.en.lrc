[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.63]I was thinking about waiting.
[00:04.19]That was a bad thing to start with.
[00:05.99]Should have done that before.
[00:06.89]That's why I'm muted.
[00:07.60]I had an opportunity to do that before the stream turned on.
[00:11.04]I don't know what I... I shouldn't be in control of this button.
[00:15.24]I was gonna wait till 1 p.m.
[00:17.70]But I'm here.
[00:19.15]I'm ready.
[00:19.59]I'm just ready to go.
[00:20.25]I don't need to wait till... I've been sitting here for like five minutes just going like, you know.
[00:25.13]Okay, I'm here.
[00:26.01]Let's just go early.
[00:29.93]Not even that early.
[00:32.88]But still, we're here.
[00:33.94]Good afternoon.
[00:35.92]If you joined us last night, today, I talked about how Dead Rising 1 was going to be the stream today.
[00:42.39]And I also made a mistake talking about what was going to happen over the next couple days.
[00:49.50]I told you I had a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[00:51.40]That's not true.
[00:52.46]It actually is the next day.
[00:54.02]So, I believe this game takes somewhere between...
[01:00.85]10 to 12 hours to do it?
[01:02.87]13 hours?
[01:04.73]So we're going to do this today, and we're going to do this tomorrow.
[01:08.93]I will then go to my doctor's appointment.
[01:13.01]So we're going to bang out Dead Rising the next two days in a row.
[01:17.91]This is a two-hour game.
[01:19.53]No, it is not.
[01:24.34]This is not a two-hour game.
[01:27.85]Yeah, what I know about Dead Rising, at least the original, in fact, all the Dead Risings, it doesn't matter which one it is, I've collectively played maybe six and a half hours of all of them combined.
[01:44.27]Dead Rising 1, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 3.
[01:47.27]So, I mean, I know how the game kind of works.
[01:52.01]I've played it off and on a couple of times randomly.
[01:56.65]60% of the way through somebody else's playthrough on a couch.
[02:00.05]Dude, take this!
[02:00.63]You gotta try Dead Rising, man.
[02:01.81]You can throw CDs at people.
[02:02.91]And I'm just like, CDs?
[02:03.45]What are you talking about?
[02:04.49]Sit down, I grab, you know, I remember grabbing the CDs.
[02:07.39]And the phrase being CDs at Zombies.
[02:10.06]And I also remember having, like, there's like a Lego set.
[02:12.68]That's the only thing I know.
[02:13.36]And you have a camera.
[02:17.41]So, I'm going to play the whole thing.
[02:21.25]Seems like one of those games that I should have done a long time ago.
[02:24.91]There's two videos of Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3.
[02:29.03]Maybe I'll just do them all.
[02:34.64]Not back to back, but should I just play Dead Rising 2?
[02:38.38]And Dead Rising 3 eventually?
[02:39.66]Just play them?
[02:41.16]All the way through?
[02:44.26]Wait, this is Dead Rising 4.
[02:49.55]Did I play Dead Rising 4?
[02:50.98]Anyone remember?
[02:51.78]Did I?
[02:55.58]What's the one where you had to get the phone app from Microsoft to like call in an airstrike?
[03:01.80]Which one was that?
[03:02.42]Was that 3 or 4?
[03:08.57]3.
[03:11.11]Yeah, there was a phone companion app that you could get for Dead Rising 3 to call in an airstrike from your phone.
[03:19.61]Well, we'll see.
[03:20.05]But that's what we're going to do today.
[03:21.49]Into tomorrow.
[03:23.71]That's the plan.
[03:25.73]And I'm almost ready to go here.
[03:28.02]Just give me one more second and we'll get started.
[03:47.75]I don't know where my lip balm is.
[03:50.23]This is bad.
[03:54.97]This is a total D.Va moment, I know, but I cannot stream without my lip balm.
[03:59.35]It's not possible.
[04:06.12]It's not possible.
[04:06.70]I can't do it.
[04:08.26]It's the only way I can livestream.
[04:12.03]Where is it?
[04:13.05]I always have two bombs right next to me at all times.
[04:17.72]Whatever.
[04:18.00]The stream is cancelled.
[04:20.64]No, fuck it.
[04:21.22]Whatever.
[04:21.46]Let's go.
[04:25.24]I'll be alright.
[04:25.88]Okay, so if the stream sucks today, it's because I didn't have lip balm on at the very beginning.
[04:31.18]Don't forget that.
[04:31.79]Alright, so I got everything ready to go.
[04:33.97]Start game is just gonna be Dead Rising 1.
[04:36.63]Let's see how fun it is.
[04:37.67]I heard it's fun.
[04:38.21]72 hour mode.
[04:42.96]New game.
[04:43.58]That's what I want to do, right?
[04:45.59]That means I have 72... That's three streams.
[04:48.37]Three full days.
[04:50.03]That's the one, right?
[04:51.31]This is the PC version.
[04:52.65]Is that a bad thing?
[05:00.75]No.
[05:01.74]No.
[05:03.18]Okay.
[05:03.74]72 hour mode.
[05:04.22]That's the one, right?
[05:07.50]September 19th, 1127.
[05:07.98]It says p.m.
[05:08.28]a.m.
[05:14.83]Cutscenesh.
[05:16.65]Haven't you played this game?
[05:19.31]Like randomly, like on a friend's couch.
[05:23.36]I've never played through the whole game.
[05:34.83]Have I played through this game on camera?
[05:36.93]No.
[05:37.81]I don't even remember.
[05:38.49]Guys, I've played like 12,000 games on stream and on video.
[05:41.77]I don't know.
[05:42.43]I have no idea.
[05:44.11]No, I didn't.
[05:45.35]You mentioned something about research for a story.
[05:48.25]That's right.
[05:49.50]Got a tip that something big's happening.
[05:52.08]In a nowhere little town like that, they sure didn't mention anything about it on TV.
[05:58.24]Yeah, well, I'm freelance, pal.
[06:00.38]I don't make my living waiting for the TV to tell me what to do.
[06:02.42]You played 4 on the street.
[06:03.30]Yeah, I kind of remember that.
[06:04.64]Not this one.
[06:18.51]Willamette, Colorado.
[06:20.49]Population 53,594.
[06:21.77]Distinguishing characteristics?
[06:26.43]Jack shit.
[06:30.05]About the only thing to do in this town is kill time at the shopping mall.
[06:36.28]Alright, everybody quiet.
[06:37.32]Nobody said anything.
[06:39.28]I'm talking to myself.
[06:44.14]What was that?
[06:45.00]The army?
[06:45.48]Yeah.
[06:48.75]I just took a sip out of my water over here.
[06:51.03]That's been here since last night, and it tastes like hamburger meat.
[06:53.92]I don't know why that's fucked up.
[06:56.74]I had to share that, because that's strange.
[06:58.26]Cooked hamburger meat.
[06:59.20]Alright, here we go.
[06:59.94]Oh, I get to take pictures.
[07:00.74]How do I take a picture?
[07:01.48]Zoom in?
[07:20.50]Should I take a photo?
[07:21.14]Oh, okay, that's zoom in.
[07:23.28]X is shutter.
[07:25.26]Got it.
[07:26.88]Oh, you got, you get points.
[07:27.96]You did points for things.
[07:28.96]Okay, move camera.
[07:30.38]Zoom in.
[07:32.70]I didn't, that's a picture of nothing.
[07:34.38]How do I zoom out?
[07:36.25]There we go.
[07:36.69]Okay, so let's zoom in and zoom out.
[07:42.21]This is Pok√©mon Snap.
[07:45.85]I need more stuff going on.
[07:46.89]Here we go.
[07:47.35]Zoom in.
[07:52.14]Nice.
[07:52.64]Brutality.
[07:56.92]Oh, wait!
[08:02.48]Action shot.
[08:05.28]Got it right when it was about to happen.
[08:08.57]Damn it, I almost had it.
[08:11.41]Save this guy?
[08:13.93]How am I supposed to save this guy?
[08:15.01]Are they on the playground?
[08:21.05]No, zoom in.
[08:25.08]I would laugh so hard if one went down the slide.
[08:27.06]Wait, here we go.
[08:27.80]He's gonna do it.
[08:30.70]Come on.
[08:33.91]Damn it.
[08:34.39]He didn't let go under the tire.
[08:35.89]Oh.
[08:44.28]They're killing this guy.
[08:45.28]I probably should have stayed on this.
[08:54.20]I gotta reduce the sensitivity on this camera too.
[08:56.00]Wait.
[08:59.50]No genre.
[09:00.16]That's a genre for the photos and everything.
[09:02.01]Should I get a picture of the skyline?
[09:07.35]That's not bad.
[09:10.75]Right here.
[09:11.03]Right down Main Street.
[09:14.04]Are they saving these photos, by the way?
[09:25.49]Oh, I have 17 photos remaining?
[09:27.55]Is that what that is?
[09:30.06]Should I... wait.
[09:31.62]That's kind of interesting.
[09:35.68]I mean, that's not interesting.
[09:39.82]There's just a guy standing on a roof.
[09:41.30]That's not that interesting.
[09:47.59]Nope, I gotta get a better one than that.
[09:52.09]Perfect.
[09:56.79]I gotta make sure I get a good angle.
[10:02.08]Whoa!
[10:02.44]No!
[10:02.94]I got it!
[10:07.86]I just barely got it too.
[10:14.16]What else we got?
[10:21.97]We're going up.
[10:23.01]Okay.
[10:30.02]Take a picture of your face?
[10:35.82]I... I can't.
[10:39.49]Here we go.
[10:41.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:41.69]Somebody fighting.
[10:45.11]Nice.
[10:45.45]She's gonna fall off.
[10:49.93]She's gonna fall off.
[10:50.41]She's gonna fall off.
[10:50.89]She's gonna fall off.
[10:56.19]I'm ready.
[10:58.43]I'm ready for the photo.
[10:59.17]Come on.
[10:59.43]I'm gonna get it right here.
[11:12.63]Come on!
[11:16.15]And... Come on!
[11:23.06]Got it!
[11:24.64]Wait, that wasn't her.
[11:34.50]I got it twice.
[11:35.64]I got it twice.
[11:38.42]Off the titantron.
[11:49.51]Why is everybody calling me fucked up?
[11:51.11]What?
[11:51.44]This is part of the game.
[11:52.22]I need to take photos of stuff.
[12:03.08]I'm a psycho?
[12:04.18]I can't save them.
[12:07.74]Hey.
[12:09.14]Can you get me on the rooftop of that mall?
[12:12.76]You gotta be kidding me.
[12:16.47]Man, you are nuts.
[12:17.83]Not with that attitude.
[12:21.17]No, not with any... I have a camera in my hand.
[12:23.93]Don't forget to come back for me.
[12:25.83]We don't have, like, grenade launchers in here.
[12:27.17]As long as you're not dead, Fred.
[12:29.48]It's Frank.
[12:30.92]Frank West.
[12:32.47]Remember that name, because the whole world's gonna know it in three days.
[12:35.56]When I get confirmed for Smash Brothers.
[12:40.76]On the next Nintendo Direct.
[12:44.32]Oh, there it goes.
[12:46.73]There's a lot of helicopters flying really close.
[12:53.25]Get us back down to that rooftop!
[13:07.03]Am I gonna make it jump for it?
[13:15.43]Get a photo of that one.
[13:16.26]Can I take a picture of this?
[13:26.48]Big Bits came in after the cutscene.
[13:36.55]You know go on the battlefield alone and turn this up no crew so What's going on around here anyway?
[13:46.87]You came by helicopter didn't you What did you see from the sky Well If it were just a riot
[14:00.73]I doubt the military would quarantine the entire area.
[14:04.32]The moratorium on information getting out is a little extreme, in my opinion.
[14:10.48]Frank is so ugly.
[14:11.06]What are you talking about?
[14:11.74]There's something else I can't put my finger on.
[14:13.42]What are you talking about?
[14:16.58]Doesn't sound like civil disobedience.
[14:19.22]It's too quiet.
[14:22.94]Almost as if everyone's already dead.
[14:30.04]Yeah.
[14:30.50]He looks like he's squished.
[14:32.56]So why don't you just tell me already?
[14:34.20]What?
[14:34.50]What?
[14:34.66]No.
[14:34.96]Alright.
[14:35.50]Just listen to the cutscene.
[14:37.70]I think you'd better see for yourself.
[14:42.48]This, my friend, is hell.
[14:51.12]We'll bring the camera up and just take a picture right in his face.
[14:56.43]So I can remember who this person is.
[14:59.66]I'd be taking pictures of everybody I came across.
[15:03.94]Can you stand right here for a second?
[15:04.80]Let me take a photo.
[15:08.85]Frank must be on the heliport at 12pm on the 22nd, or he will be left behind in the mall.
[15:15.83]Okay.
[15:17.28]Pay careful attention to the time as you play.
[15:21.60]So the check... No, it's not tab.
[15:23.23]There it is.
[15:23.51]Alright, so check watch is left on the D-pad.
[15:30.91]So it is 12 o'clock on the 19th.
[15:33.81]Oh, that's fast.
[15:36.63]Check watch.
[15:39.83]Why do I have like a world news ticker down here?
[15:44.04]Okay.
[15:50.26]Check watch.
[15:53.15]What about it?
[15:53.55]I don't need to... I checked the watch already.
[16:03.21]Looks like you're the only journalist that made it out of here.
[16:06.81]Okay.
[16:07.99]I'm looking forward to some nice pictures.
[16:09.95]Ooh, wait.
[16:10.33]Hold on.
[16:10.63]How do I take a photo?
[16:19.36]Good.
[16:20.20]Okay.
[16:27.00]Security room.
[16:28.98]Why did it just tell me to check my washing five times?
[16:32.93]You can save your progress at locations marked with S, such as the sofa in the security room or the mall's public restroom.
[16:39.51]Okay, I can save in the bathroom or in the security room.
[16:43.13]So, um, you can save your progress at locations marked with S, such as the sofa in the security room.
[16:49.85]What's in here?
[16:53.24]Uh, change clothes.
[16:54.04]Alright, I guess I'm a golfer now?
[16:58.95]What do I want to be dressed as?
[16:59.85]I don't know, I want the golf.
[17:05.53]Okay.
[17:12.77]So that's cool.
[17:14.18]Am I sprinting or is there a sprint button?
[17:19.42]Is there crafting in this one?
[17:20.84]I remember playing, like, the third and fourth one.
[17:22.44]You had to make stuff.
[17:25.66]Alright.
[17:26.54]Hold on.
[17:26.92]What's over here?
[17:27.32]Alright.
[17:33.35]I don't want to, like, waste time.
[17:35.03]Because I don't really have any time.
[17:37.19]How much time?
[17:37.97]I've been walking around for 20 minutes.
[17:39.15]Alright.
[17:39.67]Just save the game.
[17:40.37]Where's the security room?
[17:43.23]Which one of these is the security room?
[17:45.73]Straight ahead?
[17:47.94]This is the janitor's room.
[17:54.74]What is this?
[18:02.79]I'm just wasting more time.
[18:03.77]Okay.
[18:21.99]Alright, so... Zero killed.
[18:25.17]Well, actually, one is killed.
[18:31.75]Uh, staff only.
[18:32.43]No.
[18:32.77]Where's the actual security room?
[18:36.60]Is it back here?
[18:42.14]Is it up the stairs?
[18:43.58]Where's the security room?
[18:47.48]The one with the green sofa.
[18:48.80]Oh.
[18:51.75]Which one of these had a green sofa?
[18:53.65]It's just right here.
[18:54.31]It's not a security room.
[18:55.53]This is the security room.
[18:56.35]I thought I had to go in one of the... One of the rooms was a security room.
[19:05.38]No, it's the security sofa.
[19:07.44]Okay.
[19:18.10]Is there a ladder?
[19:18.96]No.
[19:24.34]So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[19:25.48]Just leave?
[19:25.94]Uh... I guess I'm going this way.
[19:47.63]Entrance?
[19:59.54]I've never played Dead Rising 1.
[20:05.98]I told you, somebody handed me the controller like 17 hours into the game to throw CDs.
[20:14.69]Who the fuck is this guy?
[20:21.55]Who are these people?
[20:23.47]She just tackled me twice.
[20:27.47]Alright, mission one, save dog.
[20:29.25]What is going on?
[20:29.83]Holy shit, this guy's eyes.
[20:55.44]Did you just say zombies?
[20:57.50]Take a look out there.
[21:00.32]If those ain't zombies, what would you call them?
[21:07.01]They're gonna get in.
[21:08.23]Why is everybody getting so close to your face?
[21:11.41]Yeah, everyone is just jumping right into your face.
[21:12.67]There's been more and more of them since last night.
[21:15.81]Now, they're all that's out there.
[21:21.05]Look on the bright side.
[21:23.20]Quit standing in my shot!
[21:36.93]This barricade sucks.
[21:41.23]You just threw a bunch of benches in the way.
[21:43.67]There's no- Where's the car that's parked in every mall?
[21:46.70]Back the car up here.
[21:47.54]There's gotta be at least two of them, right?
[21:48.72]Alright, find something.
[21:53.02]Find something to block.
[21:54.12]Alright, I don't have time for this.
[21:57.72]I'm on the clock right now.
[21:59.72]It's been an hour.
[22:01.73]Alright, find something to barricade.
[22:06.07]Okay, it's drama.
[22:08.39]That guy has a gun.
[22:08.93]Alright, whatever.
[22:10.05]Let's go.
[22:17.26]But I have to take photos of people.
[22:18.62]Hold on.
[22:21.56]Nice.
[22:21.92]More drama.
[22:23.34]How many photos do I have?
[22:24.58]I don't want to just take photos of random shit.
[22:25.86]What is this?
[22:28.38]Over the shoulder.
[22:30.04]Nice.
[22:30.56]Drama.
[22:31.32]Okay.
[22:37.33]I... I think I found something.
[22:42.17]I'm running around like a shit myself.
[22:43.71]I'm fine.
[22:47.15]You!
[22:48.61]What the hell?
[22:49.09]Can he open the door?
[22:51.13]I think they got in.
[22:51.89]No!
[23:24.05]So it's the lady saving her dog is what starts the whole outbreak here.
[23:28.41]I think the dog's a zombie.
[23:45.13]Okay, well, there's... What in the hell are you people doing?
[23:54.02]There's so many character introductions!
[23:56.34]What do I do?
[24:00.76]To the stairs.
[24:06.57]Alright, I'm going.
[24:08.03]What about everybody else down here?
[24:13.33]HDTV!
[24:14.01]Alright.
[24:14.29]Different items perform different actions.
[24:16.03]Some weapons are capable of special attacks performed by holding X for a moment.
[24:19.99]You can attack or you can hold right trigger and X's throw.
[24:24.31]Multiple items can be held in stock simultaneously.
[24:26.67]The maximum stock number can be raised by leveling up.
[24:29.73]You can change the bumpers.
[24:31.61]Throw an item down.
[24:32.43]Down.
[24:32.97]Unequipped is up.
[24:34.67]Okay.
[24:36.15]Sounds pretty simple enough.
[24:40.94]Oh f-
[24:43.13]Those are... Those are... I just... I can't remember... Oh, no!
[24:49.25]James is dead!
[24:51.49]Kathy!
[24:52.57]Kathy, hold on a second!
[24:53.73]I'm coming!
[24:54.87]I'm coming, Kathy!
[24:59.57]Stand behind me, Kathy!
[25:00.92]Get... Oh, fuck!
[25:06.86]These bits are scripted.
[25:07.88]They're supposed to die.
[25:08.94]It's scripted.
[25:10.14]It's scripted.
[25:10.72]It's okay.
[25:13.23]You can't save him.
[25:15.43]Yeah, this is scripted.
[25:16.20]You can't... Barley, come here!
[25:22.12]What are you doing?
[25:22.64]Smoking a cigarette?
[25:23.68]What are you doing?
[25:24.14]Come here!
[25:26.80]No, no, get... A little help would be... Alright, you know what?
[25:38.34]It's scripted.
[25:41.16]It's scripted, right?
[25:47.03]Whoa!
[25:50.31]When grabbed by multiple zombies, an escape command will appear on the screen.
[25:52.79]One of the commands is directed before the time runs out, and you can escape the dangerous situation.
[25:56.47]Okay.
[26:03.09]Well, I'm sorry.
[26:03.87]I tried.
[26:08.42]Barleen Willis is dead.
[26:12.34]Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!
[26:15.42]I made it.
[26:26.06]All this cause grandma wanted the dog. Yeah.
[26:33.24]Oh I made it out- no I didn't.
[26:41.87]Imagine, like, a zombie apocalypse happens and the first thing that you do is you grab a bench and just throw it just into everybody.
[26:49.22]Why would you do something like that?
[26:56.16]Like, come up with a plan.
[26:57.56]A quick one.
[26:58.76]Not grab heavy object and throw into friends.
[27:03.34]No.
[27:04.12]As long as those things are in the mall, we better not use this door.
[27:13.40]He's gonna get grabbed.
[27:47.79]Nice camera.
[27:49.51]Are you a photographer?
[27:52.27]No, no, no.
[27:52.97]Never ask anybody if they have a camera if they're a photographer.
[27:55.61]They're going to talk your ear off for like two hours.
[27:57.99]Show me some pictures, Frank.
[28:11.86]You really seem to know what you're doing.
[28:14.58]Wow, this is terrible.
[28:16.68]Why did you take pictures of people falling off of the building?
[28:19.82]I, um, I don't know.
[28:21.10]Uh, hey, we're not done talking yet.
[28:44.85]I've never taken this costume off.
[28:49.83]She wiped your SD card.
[28:52.11]Oh, 70... What?
[28:53.49]It's already been two hours?
[28:54.49]Or an hour and like ten minutes?
[29:11.04]Okay.
[29:11.92]Security room.
[29:13.07]Wait.
[29:17.15]Is there, like... I know you don't eat food.
[29:20.07]You do, right?
[29:20.65]How do you eat it?
[29:23.45]Okay.
[29:23.93]So I'm gonna take coffee creamer.
[29:25.83]I'm gonna take two coffee creamers.
[29:29.21]I can't... Okay, I gotta... Okay.
[29:36.57]What's up?
[29:37.86]You ain't planning on going back down into the mall, are you?
[29:39.88]I wouldn't do that if I were you, but you... you young... Well, if you're gonna do it, at least take this.
[29:44.72]Transceiver with you.
[29:46.28]And you better take this.
[29:47.14]You obtained the mall map.
[29:48.22]You obtained the transceiver, alright.
[29:50.90]You obtained the mall map.
[29:55.10]Okay, so how do I use it?
[29:56.50]Well, how do I... should I just go in?
[29:57.90]I'm going... go in?
[30:00.20]Any quest or anything?
[30:01.02]I'm just going in.
[30:04.14]I didn't save the game.
[30:05.03]Fuck.
[30:05.51]Whatever.
[30:09.61]I'll be fine.
[30:14.12]This is a timed game.
[30:15.14]I can't just like dilly-dally.
[30:20.48]Okay.
[30:26.50]I'm on the roof.
[30:28.98]Jeff!
[30:31.34]Jeff!
[30:33.22]Come here.
[30:35.44]You, have you seen my wife Natalie?
[30:37.73]She should still be around here.
[30:39.49]Hey, hey, hey.
[30:40.77]I'll lend a hand.
[30:42.65]That's a pretty good weapon.
[30:45.07]Fellow golfer, I see.
[30:47.43]The name's Jeff Mayer, by the way.
[30:49.11]I'm Frank.
[30:51.17]I'm telling you, that back nine here is killer.
[30:56.31]Escorting survivors.
[30:57.67]Survivors each behave differently depending on the circumstances.
[31:01.62]And their own varying personalities.
[31:04.48]It is a good idea to escort as many as possible to the safety of the security room.
[31:08.61]Call survivor or set goal marker.
[31:10.53]Okay, so it's right trigger and Y. So Y is to be like, come here.
[31:14.43]Okay.
[31:16.61]Okay, join.
[31:17.25]So... Alright, so follow me.
[31:20.99]We're gonna find, uh... We're gonna find your wife is around here somewhere.
[31:24.72]Natalie, found you.
[31:31.42]Come on!
[31:34.08]Come on, Jeff.
[31:37.52]I don't know how you guys even got separated.
[31:39.78]It's an open spot.
[31:41.04]It's an open space.
[31:43.24]Wait, wait.
[31:45.04]Hey, hey!
[31:49.92]Okay, let's go.
[31:51.63]I'll never let you go again.
[31:54.41]We have to go now.
[31:58.62]It's not safe.
[31:59.18]I know a place.
[31:59.68]I'll take you to the security room.
[32:01.20]Once the number of photos taken exceeds 30, they'll begin to be deleted in order automatically.
[32:04.52]You can save any photo from the imminent deletion by choosing to keep Y in the picture viewer.
[32:08.15]What?
[32:08.33]Alright, let's go.
[32:09.73]Come on, come on, come on.
[32:10.23]Let's go.
[32:13.61]PP prestige points are awarded for actions such as escorting survivors to safety...
[32:18.88]Or defeating zombies, right?
[32:20.46]When the PP gauge becomes full, Frank levels up.
[32:23.94]Right?
[32:25.60]Attack power increases.
[32:27.08]Speed is running speed.
[32:28.30]Life is maximum health.
[32:29.28]Stock is item stock.
[32:30.28]Throw is item throw distance.
[32:32.80]And a new skill mastered is a new skill learned.
[32:35.11]Or does it automatically, I assume.
[32:36.65]Alright, come on.
[32:39.71]Both of you, let's go.
[32:42.91]What are you doing?
[32:43.51]Come here.
[32:44.17]Hurry up.
[32:45.79]I'm on the clock right now.
[32:46.85]Please, hurry up.
[32:53.46]What are they doing?
[33:00.05]What?
[33:02.89]Why won't they follow me?
[33:09.11]What's going on?
[33:10.49]Talk to them?
[33:11.01]I can't.
[33:12.03]Oh, fuck.
[33:13.03]I just fucking backhanded her.
[33:15.47]Why can't I talk to them?
[33:17.98]Okay, we're good.
[33:23.17]Hurry up!
[33:23.59]No!
[33:24.59]Let's go.
[33:24.87]Alright, we're good.
[33:25.35]We're good.
[33:26.55]I didn't even hit the punch button.
[33:29.07]Alright, to safety.
[33:31.09]It's up here.
[33:31.49]Follow me.
[33:31.94]This way.
[33:38.84]Come on up.
[33:43.72]Can she make it?
[33:44.32]Come on.
[33:44.68]Natalie, hurry up!
[33:46.13]Alright, go in there.
[33:49.16]No, no, no, no, no.
[33:49.78]Go in.
[33:50.84]Did he just call me a bitch?
[33:53.36]No, get in here.
[33:54.64]Did they go in?
[33:55.26]Okay, good.
[34:00.67]I'm never going to the mall again as long as I live.
[34:02.61]I've had about enough of this.
[34:06.21]Escort complete.
[34:07.81]Freddy Dredge just gave 5,000 bits.
[34:09.63]Alright, time to go back out.
[34:10.75]Level up.
[34:12.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[34:14.96]Save the game.
[34:16.58]Anything else in here?
[34:17.86]Through here?
[34:20.13]No message from Freddy Dredd, just a shitload of money.
[34:21.89]Thank you, Freddy Dredd.
[34:23.13]Seriously.
[34:25.05]Okay, I'm good.
[34:30.39]Yes, override.
[34:40.10]Mid-to-late game, hand-to-hand is nuts.
[34:43.70]Alright, hold on.
[34:44.34]Give me another apple.
[34:46.14]Okay, I have two coffee creamers, an apple, and a golf club.
[34:50.42]Alright, let's go.
[34:55.03]Alright, I saved the first two people.
[35:00.03]Go down the elevator?
[35:02.71]I guess I'm gonna go down.
[35:03.53]I learned jump kick?
[35:12.14]Nice.
[35:12.36]Is somebody calling me?
[35:15.39]Hey, it's Otis, back in the security room.
[35:16.69]Can you hear me, Frank?
[35:18.01]Let me give you a rundown of the mall's layout so you know what you're doing.
[35:22.23]Right, on the other side of the warehouse you'll find Paradise Plaza.
[35:25.21]There's lots of shops there.
[35:26.19]Restaurants, sporting goods, books.
[35:27.81]It's a pretty big mall, so you'll probably need to use the can now and then.
[35:30.83]Just check the... What was it?
[35:33.74]Left?
[35:34.60]What was it?
[35:35.04]Which button was it?
[35:35.84]I don't know.
[35:37.02]People are talking too fast.
[35:41.70]Stop.
[35:41.88]Frank, are you there?
[35:43.90]It's me, Otis the janitor.
[35:52.81]Why did you have to hang up and call again?
[35:55.54]God, it's you.
[35:56.44]Look, don't sneak up on me.
[36:18.00]Brad was attacked.
[36:19.42]I located him on the monitor.
[36:21.92]It's probably just a sprain.
[36:24.64]I've got to help Brad, or he's done for.
[36:27.91]Alright, fine.
[36:29.49]Give me your gun.
[36:31.55]Come on.
[36:32.35]I'm the reason you just got hurt.
[36:33.97]Let me help.
[36:35.01]No, I can't let a civilian do that.
[36:37.33]That's against regulations.
[36:39.40]Yeah, well, I don't think they had zombie-infested malls in mind when they wrote those regulations, kid.
[36:46.18]No idea.
[36:48.48]Absolutely not a clue at all.
[36:50.30]See, at this point when I hold it backwards and aim with the handle forward and go, just use this thing, I don't know, and then you like wink at the camera.
[37:10.91]And then you go, you scoff and you walk away.
[37:18.01]Alright, case one.
[37:20.25]September 19th from 12 p.m.
[37:23.08]Case one, two.
[37:24.26]Okay.
[37:26.12]The case panels form a guide to solving the mystery behind the incident.
[37:29.66]When you encounter a key event, a new case panel opens, taking you one step closer to the truth.
[37:35.99]New development.
[37:39.33]The case.
[37:40.09]You've been handed a gun.
[37:42.81]You can take a look at the current status of the case panels via the case file option on the pause menu.
[37:47.73]Okay.
[37:49.17]When all the case panels have been filled in, the truth behind the incident will be revealed.
[37:54.80]Alright.
[37:55.18]So it's open right now.
[37:57.40]So this is like the story.
[38:00.02]Back up for Brad.
[38:02.84]Don't cut me off like that.
[38:04.02]It's rude.
[38:04.58]Anyway, here's what I was going to say.
[38:06.60]There's some young guy wandering around the Paradise Plaza.
[38:08.48]He's carrying a camera like you.
[38:11.72]I guess he must be a photographer too, taking pictures at a time like this.
[38:14.66]You're both crazy.
[38:18.17]ScoopCue.
[38:20.23]The ScoopCue provides a list of current requests along with relevant information on survivors.
[38:25.49]If you're able to fulfill the objective laid out in the ScoopCue before time runs out, you can receive PP or learn more about the incident.
[38:33.12]So if you look at your watch, backup for Brad has more than six hours.
[38:38.86]If it's yellow, it means it's less than six hours.
[38:40.84]And if it's red, that means it's less than three hours.
[38:43.91]And then if it's gray, there's no time limit at all.
[38:46.89]Okay.
[38:47.45]So by setting a guide arrow, you'll be able to more easily navigate your way to a given goal.
[38:54.77]Guide arrows can be set via the watch screen or the map screen access via the pause menu.
[38:59.47]Okay.
[39:01.59]So the guide, so when you open your watch, it'll tell you where to go.
[39:05.61]Interesting.
[39:08.91]Back up for Brad.
[39:10.87]So, here we go.
[39:11.39]Back up for Brad is currently selected.
[39:12.71]I can select... Cut from the same cloth.
[39:16.51]I got time to do Brad.
[39:18.73]Alright, cut from the same cloth is currently on.
[39:22.39]I can get rid of the coffee creamer.
[39:24.19]Alright, here we go.
[39:24.83]I'm ready.
[39:25.15]Let's go.
[39:26.31]Back up for Brad.
[39:30.37]No, not back up for Brad.
[39:34.25]Cut from the same cloth.
[39:34.95]Alright, gotta go this way.
[39:38.67]We have six- less than six hours?
[39:43.71]Holy fuck, I just ended that person.
[39:51.00]Okay, uh, is it up top?
[39:52.56]Alright, I gotta go up.
[39:53.56]Is there an escalate?
[39:54.16]Stairs.
[40:02.50]That's fun.
[40:06.00]Going to the toy store?
[40:07.10]Not yet.
[40:07.48]I only have six hours.
[40:08.80]I have six hours to do this.
[40:12.80]I gotta find the photographer.
[40:16.36]Got it.
[40:16.60]Alright, this person has a gun.
[40:27.53]Hey you!
[40:27.91]You're in my way!
[40:30.11]Can't you see I'm hard at work?
[40:31.09]I'm trying to take some pictures here.
[40:34.01]You've got a nice camera there yourself.
[40:35.19]Do you know the first thing about photography?
[40:39.01]Uh, yeah.
[40:42.27]Sorry about that, you know.
[40:43.11]I happen to be a pro, too.
[40:44.17]Maybe not as good as you, but... You think you're a professional, huh?
[40:48.49]Alright, got ya.
[40:50.27]Do you really appreciate the weight of the word professional carries?
[40:54.63]If you don't have the talent, you can't just use that word like you own it.
[41:03.31]Alright, so do I have to give him a good photo?
[41:08.28]Name's Frank West.
[41:08.92]Sorry I got in the way of your shot.
[41:11.60]I'll just get out of your hair now.
[41:14.16]Okay, okay.
[41:14.62]Hang on a sec, buddy.
[41:16.94]Why don't I do you a favor?
[41:17.93]I'll have a look at your technique and give you some pointers.
[41:21.31]Okay.
[41:21.71]Don't be shy now, Frankie.
[41:22.91]Here, I'll even model for you.
[41:25.21]Show me what you can do and I'll be the judge.
[41:28.17]What a great idea, huh?
[41:28.95]Sometimes I think I'm a genius.
[41:30.09]Let's get started.
[41:30.61]Well, let's go.
[41:31.05]I'm on the clock right now.
[41:33.91]What?
[41:36.19]When taking photos, note that the larger of the target marker, the more PP you will gain from that photo.
[41:43.01]Also, if you manage to take a photo while attacking, while being damaged, or in some of the non-standard status, the target marker will change to red, indicating an increase in potential PP.
[41:52.50]Okay.
[41:55.14]Right.
[41:57.00]The color of the target marker indicates the genre of the photo.
[42:01.45]The genre that nets the most PP will take precedence over other genres that could be included in said photo.
[42:07.55]Sexually stimulating images, horrifying images, humorous images, emotionally stirring and violent images.
[42:16.73]Alright.
[42:19.05]So, okay, first I want you to take a picture of me while I show off my photography skills.
[42:26.08]What are you doing?
[42:26.76]Do it!
[42:31.79]That was fucking quick!
[42:37.57]You did it!
[42:37.95]Nice job!
[42:38.57]I took a damn good one.
[42:40.19]Next, I'll treat you my signature cool pose.
[42:43.87]You get 200- 700 pp's.
[42:45.91]Okay, what do you say we change the workouts?
[42:52.98]He's gonna die.
[42:56.18]Wait, was I-
[42:59.66]You kind of not give me, you give me like, what are you doing?
[43:02.48]You're going to get killed.
[43:03.38]He's going to die.
[43:05.76]Holy shit, that dodge.
[43:09.36]Okay.
[43:15.78]Get a good one of me.
[43:21.61]Perfect.
[43:22.83]No, he's doing like a...
[43:28.53]I didn't get it?
[43:36.59]Hey, I'm not posing over here for no reason.
[43:38.63]You gotta take it.
[43:47.59]What is he doing?
[43:51.70]That was not cool.
[43:53.38]That was really uncool.
[43:55.66]Okay.
[43:57.58]No, do you pose.
[43:58.88]There it is.
[44:00.88]That's not drama!
[44:03.12]Am I in the frame?
[44:05.87]Hey, I'm not posing up here.
[44:06.69]No, you gotta take it right.
[44:07.53]Where the fuck are you going?
[44:12.29]Let me take a photo of you, please.
[44:16.31]Alright.
[44:19.30]That's not his pose?! !
[44:29.52]Alright, for the love of God!

[44:36.47]What do you... What do you mean it's no good?
[44:43.57]I'm not posing it for no reason.
[44:44.49]You gotta take it... You gotta time it right.
[44:55.48]I need to get 700...
[45:07.80]This vision is wonky.
[45:11.96]I'm wasting so much fucking time.

[46:32.85]So, okay, what am I doing?
[46:34.09]What am I doing wrong?
[46:38.64]It doesn't make any sense.
[46:41.06]Everyone told me this was a wonky mission, but I don't understand.
[46:43.56]I need zombies in the photo?
[47:16.90]Okay, I'm trying this one more time and I'm fucking just gonna leave
[47:34.52]What the fuck is going on?

[48:05.20]Okay.
[48:06.92]So, is this mission impossible?
[48:27.27]Perfect.

[49:45.29]Mm-hmm.
[49:46.53]Yeah.
[49:51.17]Okay.

[49:55.77]So, I have no battery in my camera.
[49:59.03]So where's the battery store?
[50:02.67]Is it back here?
[50:04.07]Somebody said the battery store was down this way.
[50:06.03]There's a camera shop.
[50:09.93]There's a battery store?
[50:13.03]It's the first floor?

[52:14.85]Please charge the batteries.
[52:16.07]What the fuck?
[52:16.91]Where are the batteries?
[52:19.67]Batteries.

[53:19.61]Okay, this is... I need something to use as a weapon.
[53:29.44]Okay, a hanger.
[53:30.18]That works.
[53:35.12]This way.
[53:39.38]Toy store?
[53:40.00]Wait, people are going to scream at me if I don't go in here.
[53:41.70]Alright, what's in the toy store?

[55:12.89]Run!
[55:13.61]Faster!
[55:14.11]I know I can run faster than this.
[55:18.37]I need to upgrade my speed.
[55:24.81]So this is another section of the mall.
[55:26.10]Okay, I get it.
[55:31.31]I need to get more PP.
[55:32.39]Okay, I got you.
[55:35.05]Why are you guys holding my hand?
[55:37.68]Don't get surrounded.
[55:45.16]Don't get surrounded.
[55:45.58]That's stupid.
[55:53.51]Come on.
[55:54.33]Wait.
[55:55.15]I see a lawnmower.
[55:56.27]That's way more important right now.
[55:57.49]I can get extra PP, I think.
[55:58.65]Okay, lawnmower time.
[56:04.93]How do I drive a lawnmower?
[56:09.29]Do you have to... Why do I eat a fucking apple?
[56:15.23]Fuck.
[56:15.71]Okay.
[56:16.67]I need... Oh, this is bad.
[56:20.14]This is really bad.
[56:20.86]Really bad.
[56:22.02]Who just threw somebody... Did somebody just throw that?
[56:29.94]How do I drive it?
[56:34.32]Ahhhh.
[56:35.82]Shit, not good.
[56:36.86]Alright, it's over, it's over, it's over.
[56:39.96]Otis!
[56:40.68]I found somebody in the jewelry shop!
[56:42.34]Okay.
[56:53.63]Yeah, it's on there in the cutscenes, I know.
[57:20.12]By the way, how many drugs are you on a Shitload man.
[57:24.06]Okay.
[57:24.42]We'll have to talk about this later way too many that gun.
[57:27.48]I've never fired at a person.
[57:28.82]I
[57:31.58]Alright, I'll cover you from here.
[57:32.71]You need to stick to the shadows.
[57:34.95]Try to get close to the target, okay?
[57:36.63]And what am I supposed to do when I get close?
[57:41.65]Well, the best solution would be to shoot the guy.
[57:45.22]But if you can't do that, keep him busy dodging your bullets and stay out of trouble.
[57:51.30]Are you up to it?
[57:52.36]I think I got, like, picked up at a rave.
[57:53.48]I'm a lot better with a camera.
[57:56.22]But, yeah, I'll give it a shot.
[57:59.37]Alright.
[58:02.01]Coachella.
[58:02.35]Okay.
[58:02.47]Let's go.
[58:02.73]Do I have a sneak?
[58:31.95]Otis, don't cut me off like that!
[58:33.85]It's rude!
[58:41.70]Nope, that's not gonna work.
[58:45.64]Otis, leave me the fuck alone!
[58:48.50]Don't cut me off!
[58:49.32]Anyways, I was saying.
[58:50.12]I don't know, whatever you're saying.
[58:51.33]And it's somebody at the jewelry store, I know.
[58:52.85]I found a woman at the jewelry shop.
[58:53.97]Not a good time.
[58:58.99]Okay, she's moving around an awful lot.
[59:00.73]Alright.
[59:02.30]great oh oh

[59:46.34]Which window?
[59:47.04]Same one?
[59:50.78]Don't use that many bullets.
[59:51.54]I don't want to use them all.
[59:52.68]He's got half health.
[59:57.07]Oh, shit.
[59:57.67]Shit.
[59:58.01]Hide.
[59:58.67]How do I duck?
[60:04.19]Oh, fuck.
[60:16.18]God damn it.
[60:17.40]How did none of those hit?
[60:19.54]What the fuck?
[60:25.45]Wait, Frank this.
[60:42.51]Oh, that's a grenade!
[60:44.05]Where'd he go?
[60:56.16]I'm gonna climb up.
[61:06.04]No, no, no, no, no, bad idea.
[61:07.05]Alright, he's almost dead.
[61:10.33]Is he shooting himself?
[61:15.07]He's shooting himself with a gun.
[61:21.57]He's going to kill himself with a grenade.
[61:25.93]Oh, shit.
[61:26.55]It was a decoy.
[61:31.84]How many grenades do you have?
[61:33.68]I'm going to go this way.
[61:44.33]Wrap around.
[61:53.78]He's gonna come over here.
[62:01.48]Run this way.
[62:03.98]Come on, over here.
[62:04.64]Alright, I'm gonna go up.
[62:13.74]I'm not gonna bait him out.
[62:17.06]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[62:20.86]He's burning his hands on the gun.
[62:26.43]I shot first.
[62:27.40]Bullshit.
[62:32.10]I... Excuse me.
[62:33.12]I don't... understand.
[62:36.16]Um... I'm in trouble now.
[62:37.90]I was literally shooting him with a gun.
[62:41.72]Now what the fuck do I do?
[62:47.55]I'm gonna try... Okay, I'm gonna throw the grenade back up to him.
[62:49.07]It's risky, but I'm gonna try it.
[62:53.59]Is that possible?
[63:02.16]I'm not gonna be able to throw anything up there.
[63:05.48]Can I throw the cash register up there?
[63:11.01]Shit.
[63:11.21]Okay, I think I can do it.
[63:19.21]Oh, shit.
[63:20.63]Wait.
[63:21.49]Corn.
[63:21.69]Alright, I'm gonna throw the bottle of Tabasco sauce at him.
[63:32.21]Right in the skull.
[63:33.95]Where is he?
[63:38.75]Where is he?
[63:43.81]Is he still hiding?
[63:44.48]Can I get up there?
[63:45.22]What if I can sneak around behind him?
[63:46.74]Wait a minute.
[63:48.46]I'm going up there.
[63:52.90]Come on, I can't do it.
[63:53.70]Let me get up here.
[63:54.46]There's no way for me to climb up this?
[64:00.79]There has to be, right?
[64:07.20]Can't reach this.
[64:08.44]Oh, what about all the way around?
[64:09.38]Yeah, I can get on these boxes, but can I go from here?
[64:19.09]Can I pick up the boxes?
[64:20.05]I guess I can.
[64:20.97]Well, I can't.
[64:21.35]They're this way.
[64:30.90]Where the fuck is he?
[64:39.87]Where did he go?
[64:46.83]He's gonna unload a clip on me.
[64:53.39]Imagine how embarrassing this would be.
[64:55.13]Having a guy sneak up behind you.
[64:58.93]He's not- Where is he?
[65:02.87]Uh.
[65:09.94]Where'd he go?
[65:10.94]Did he come... jump down?
[65:24.55]Uh... He's behind me.
[65:28.41]In the restaurant over here?
[65:34.46]Is he the Pair of Pants?
[65:45.35]Is it the Pair of Pants?
[65:46.39]You can't hit it with the Pair of Pants!
[65:54.07]Wait, this is fucked up!
[65:57.10]No, I need a better picture than this.
[65:58.08]Okay.
[66:17.84]Just leave and come back?
[66:18.87]Wait, I'm going to try and throw a table at the Pear Pants.
[66:22.65]No, the barrel right here.
[66:30.39]Alright, I'm going to... I'll just Donkey Kong this guy.
[66:32.17]Fucking god damn.
[66:38.60]How did I... I thought I was going to roll it.
[66:48.03]Just because I say something's gonna happen doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
[66:59.10]Okay, kill him!
[67:01.66]Murder these fucking pants!
[67:22.18]I can't do anything about this.
[67:27.18]That's not the boss.
[67:28.80]What are you talking about?
[67:32.52]So is he another pair of pants?
[67:33.90]Okay.
[67:43.73]I'm gonna leave and come out.
[67:46.41]Can I even leave?
[67:51.90]Okay.
[67:52.96]I'm gonna leave and then go back in.
[67:59.99]Go look for the angry pants.
[68:04.29]Okay, now... Alright, barricade... uh... There he is.
[68:20.65]Alright, I don't even have a weapon.
[68:22.41]I gotta get a chair up there.
[68:25.66]He just killed himself with a grenade.
[68:51.00]Oh, they've evolved.
[68:57.30]Wait.
[68:59.17]Why am I still holding a chair?
[69:00.81]What?
[69:02.15]This motherfucker's still up here?
[69:03.87]Okay, I've got a chair up there.
[69:09.49]Chair is up there.
[69:10.25]I'm gonna kill him with the fucking chair.
[69:14.53]I'm sneaking up behind him and I'm gonna bash his fucking brains in.
[69:30.38]Where is he?
[69:34.55]He's gone again.
[69:36.47]What?
[69:38.99]If this is a pair of pants down here, I'm gonna be so mad.
[69:41.03]Uh, what am I supposed to do?
[69:56.96]What's wrong with my game?
[69:58.30]I don't know.
[69:58.78]I don't know.
[70:03.06]I don't know what's going on.
[70:04.08]This is the first time I've ever played this.
[70:08.58]Do I have to leave and come back again?
[70:09.74]I hear something over here.
[70:15.81]Motherfucker.
[70:17.91]Okay, I'm gonna come back.
[70:39.44]I'm wasting so much time.
[70:48.27]Is he back?
[70:50.23]Okay, I need to just go up there and punch the fucking shit out of him.
[70:53.83]Don't!
[70:54.45]Don't disappear!
[70:54.99]Okay, I gotta keep my eyes on him.
[71:02.17]Okay, he's still talking.
[71:03.01]Good.
[71:04.17]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[71:05.35]Okay, okay, okay.
[71:06.61]He's still up there.
[71:07.35]He's still up there.
[71:07.81]He's still up there.
[71:08.25]He's still up there.
[71:08.91]He's shooting.
[71:09.35]Good.
[71:09.99]Excellent.
[71:10.33]Okay, great.
[71:11.45]Get this up.
[71:12.13]Chair up top.
[71:13.91]God damn it.
[71:14.66]Did he blow the chair up?
[71:25.90]Oh, you... I'm just punching him in the face.
[71:28.56]Fuck it.
[71:29.22]This is ridiculous.
[71:45.88]This is so much fucking time wasted.
[71:49.12]Yeah, he just reloaded too.
[71:50.72]Why did he have to turn into pants?!
[72:05.53]Brad!
[72:06.59]Where's Brad?
[72:07.23]Brad!
[72:08.23]Brad?!
[72:09.61]Brad!

[72:30.00]Just- am I eating flour? No, eat the corn, quick!
[72:47.37]What am I doing?
[72:48.63]No, go up here.
[72:50.75]Okay, I'm just taking like fucking five frying pans.
[72:56.55]I have to end this.
[72:57.61]I ran out of bullets.
[72:59.28]This sucks.
[73:04.82]How am I gonna do this?
[73:05.66]Can I get ammo from Brad?
[73:06.84]I'm gonna spend the next 72 hours here.
[73:18.41]I can get ammo from Brad, but he's a pair of pants!

[87:46.70]So down here and a little bit to the right.
[87:48.77]Oh my god, why are we doing this?
[87:50.57]Sir, if you could just kindly come with us, we can wrap this whole thing up.
[87:54.52]No, I'm not leaving until you can guarantee me safe passage.
[87:58.38]Just open this gate.
[87:59.46]Just open this gate.
[88:00.66]It's for your protection.
[88:01.79]I am not opening any gate.
[88:03.01]He's trying to see through the bottom of the mask.
[88:04.89]I'm going to stay right here when it's safe.
[88:07.69]Thank you and goodbye.
[88:08.97]Dr. Barnaby?
[88:15.13]Well, what happened?
[88:19.25]You can't just arrest him?
[88:21.38]He turned down my offer to protect him.
[88:23.45]Said he isn't going anywhere until I can guarantee a secure route out of here.
[88:30.55]Jesse has a direct line to HQ.
[88:32.69]It's like in anime.
[88:35.27]If I was in a costume in anime and somebody said something, it would zoom into the inside of the costume and I'd be like, oh my god, I'd have a bunch of reactions in here.
[88:52.40]Somebody gave a 10,000 bits like 10 minutes ago.
[88:58.43]Oh, that was Gibler.
[88:59.39]Thank you for the $100.
[89:01.45]10,000 bits 10 minutes ago.
[89:04.59]Hey, Jeremy, I'm so glad to see you playing my favorite game, The Thing, again.
[89:08.29]Wait, I was mistaken.

[89:12.88]That's thanks for the Thing money.
[89:15.00]Appreciate it.

[89:21.06]So, thank you, all of you.
[89:23.53]Alright, Case 1.
[89:24.43]We're almost done with Case 1.
[89:27.70]Frank, right now you're in the entrance plaza.
[89:31.30]Looks like you got the shutter open.
[89:32.90]If you want to change it to some fresh duds, just ta- I hung up on you.
[89:41.58]What?
[89:45.98]What did he say?

[89:52.88]Can I go up?
[89:55.78]What did he- Is there like a-
[89:59.68]Out of control.
[90:00.40]A temporary agreement.
[90:01.78]It's almost done.
[90:04.26]You're almost finished with the first part.
[90:05.44]Yeah, but... So... What did he say?
[90:07.66]Where can I go?
[90:08.12]I need to, like, get back to the safe zone.
[90:16.29]Go to Paradise Plaza?
[90:17.27]Because I... No, I gotta go... This way and then to the right.
[90:24.45]Because I need to go to the warehouse.
[90:27.21]Yeah, I gotta go to the warehouse.
[90:31.28]So, is it this way?
[90:33.52]Wait.
[90:34.42]No, it's not.
[90:34.91]Where the fuck am I going?
[90:35.99]Is it this way and then to the right, or is it up the stairs?
[90:39.75]Everyone scream if I'm going the wrong way.
[90:47.39]Alright, everyone's screaming.
[90:48.27]Alright, so, no, okay.
[90:52.21]Turn around completely, and then it's to the right.
[90:53.89]Okay, so it's up that way.
[91:02.48]Everyone got timed out because he's going the wrong way.
[91:09.37]So then this way?
[91:11.23]Can I even get in here?
[91:15.45]Does this even open?
[91:17.33]This shit don't even open.
[91:18.29]I have to go up the stairs in that way.
[91:19.77]Oh, okay.
[91:20.15]I have to go all the way back around.
[91:23.68]Oh, shit.
[91:24.20]Okay.
[91:24.56]That's annoying.
[91:27.66]Go to the arrow?
[91:28.36]Well, I'm not trying to go to the arrow.
[91:30.42]I'm trying to go to the safe zone.
[91:33.93]Is that taking me to the safe zone?
[91:42.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:45.87]Okay, so where's the... From here, where is it?
[91:51.06]So now I gotta go... Ah, fuck.
[91:56.48]Do I have to do this?
[92:00.00]Current mission is back to the safe zone, so yes, he follows the arrow.
[92:06.04]Oh, but fuck, it's right here.
[92:10.63]So wait, follow the arrow?
[92:11.75]I keep getting fucking phone calls.
[92:14.86]Just go, okay, I'm just gonna follow the arrow.
[92:25.99]The door is welded, it's a dead end.
[92:27.67]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[92:29.25]So, I have to go back down?
[92:30.77]I'm getting confused here.
[92:38.02]Downstairs, and then that way.
[92:39.72]That's the way I was going!
[92:46.57]I'm not gonna throw her off the ledge!
[92:58.69]What the fuck?
[92:59.35]Why is it so dark?
[93:00.01]Oh, it's because it's nighttime.
[93:12.59]Holy shit, I have, like, no time left.
[93:18.30]Alright, Grandpa, if you butt-dial me one more time, I swear to God...
[93:27.84]It's like, if I were to go and get my computer infected with a bunch of viruses to make sure that I got scam phone calls, and I mean go to every website and give my phone number to every single website that is a scam site, I wouldn't get called this much.
[93:57.34]Alright, almost there.
[94:03.14]Okay, I remember this.
[94:04.26]I have to go all the way... Wait, wasn't I back here already?
[94:12.64]I'm going the long way.
[94:14.25]Wait, what is happening?
[94:27.89]Okay.

[94:36.20]What are they... Oh.
[94:40.00]Alright, I have to stop this.
[94:42.72]Do I have... Do I still have my gun?
[94:45.46]It's scripted.

[95:05.05]Um... Are they in the car?
[95:09.85]Uh... Where's the car?
[95:13.18]Alright, this is actually concerning.

[108:20.05]But we've rewound an hour and forty minutes.
[108:26.43]I blame... I blame... What was her name?
[108:28.55]Lucy?
[108:31.28]I had two guys that had, like, weapons.
[108:34.51]And then they both died because we were rescuing Lucy from the jewelry store.
[108:38.87]And then I got run over by a car.
[108:46.37]Did I beat the thing?
[108:47.36]Oh, yeah.
[108:56.10]I'm gonna be underleveled.
[108:57.62]Underleveled.
[109:01.43]Wait, this is my opportunity.

[110:34.14]I have two guns.
[110:47.40]You can't even hurt him.
[110:48.00]You can't even hit him.
[110:49.26]He's unhittable until he stands up.
[110:54.95]What does he have?
[111:02.40]Fast.
[111:02.92]Just do it.
[111:03.50]And I'll be almost there.

[111:27.17]Brad, ammo?
[111:34.00]Holy shit, wait.
[111:34.86]That's fun.
[111:41.30]Hold on, that's fun.
[111:41.94]That's fun, I wanna do that.
[111:48.11]You know, this is actually gonna be a good thing, because I'll beat him quickly.
[112:14.79]I didn't hit him with any... Is he healing?
[112:45.12]Almost dead, almost dead, it's okay, it's alright, don't worry.
[112:46.76]I would say, alright, alright, alright, don't be fucking greedy and cocky here.
[112:54.61]Heal, just in case.
[112:55.43]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[113:05.30]It's, it's this, it's this, it's this incessant ringing of the telephone.

[122:43.49]Okay.
[122:43.75]Yes.
[122:45.49]Oh, God.
[122:46.29]I know.
[122:46.61]Goodness.
[122:50.35]Okay, good.
[122:51.85]Thank you.
[122:52.87]Stick around for a little bit.
[122:53.77]I don't have any more weapons.
[122:55.21]Okay.
[122:56.05]Um, sure.
[122:56.89]Come on, I'm not gonna let you die here.

[123:42.77]Come on!
[123:48.45]Stop!
[123:49.39]I trapped him!
[123:53.83]I'm gonna scream!
[124:02.25]Does she not know how to climb?
[124:12.59]How do I get her out of here?
[124:22.88]Let's go.
[124:23.08]You guys are the ones that have the weapons.
[124:33.56]Fellas.
[124:34.70]Oh my god.
[124:40.55]What are we doing here?
[124:44.63]Are they seriously stuck there?
[124:50.67]They are.
[124:53.75]Follow me!
[124:54.91]Follow me!
[124:55.75]Follow me!
[124:56.59]Follow me!
[124:57.41]Follow me!
[124:57.87]Brad, I'm... I traded.
[125:11.46]Fuck.
[125:13.86]No!
[125:15.94]Go!
[125:17.81]Over there!
[125:18.33]You go over there and stay over there?
[125:20.17]Oh, fuck.
[125:36.26]I can get there in time.
[125:40.34]Where the hell are they?
[125:45.21]Where are they?
[125:49.31]Where are they?
[126:07.30]He's just falling.
[126:09.14]Let's go this way.
[126:10.40]Me?
[126:10.78]To me.
[126:11.50]To me.
[126:16.17]This is un-fucking-believable.
[126:17.37]I'm gonna throw a sofa in there.
[126:18.83]I have to throw a chair or something at him.
[126:38.71]Wrapped in here.
[126:40.95]Can I pick him up?
[126:54.28]Yes, I saw this already.
[126:57.24]Go that way.
[127:03.80]How do I just punch?
[127:08.64]That's why.
[127:09.12]Come this way.
[127:15.55]This AI.
[127:16.55]Holy shit.
[127:17.27]You guys are brainless.
[127:19.05]Finally, Brat.
[127:19.83]Bert, you got up.
[127:21.67]I wonder... Alright.
[127:22.42]Good.
[127:22.68]Nice work, everybody.
[127:23.60]Now move.
[127:25.02]Don't care.
[127:25.72]Go.
[127:29.72]Come on.
[127:29.98]Fruit.
[127:30.30]You can do it.
[127:30.70]You can do it.
[127:31.02]You can do it.
[127:31.38]Come on.
[127:32.48]I got orange juice when you're done.
[127:34.07]Give me that weapon.
[127:35.09]Trade me.
[127:39.34]Don't- I- Heal with the orange juice!
[127:42.24]Alright, let's go, let's go!
[127:43.62]Out!
[127:43.94]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out!
[127:45.32]Leia's being attacked!
[127:47.00]I swear to god if I die here, I am going to fucking throw them.
[127:50.05]Throw them.
[127:51.79]What's wrong with me?
[128:00.35]He's- He's got his hands on his fucking hips!
[128:03.76]This is un-fucking-believable.
[128:12.26]Who cares?
[128:12.62]This is on.
[128:19.66]They won't listen to me.
[128:29.03]They got stuck behind the kiosk in the jewelry store.
[128:31.63]They wouldn't come out.
[128:33.01]Oh, no.
[128:34.07]The original timeline is happening now.
[128:36.23]They would have had full health.
[128:40.11]I don't care.
[128:41.05]Fuck it.
[128:47.57]Fucking idiots couldn't figure out how to walk over a jewelry counter.
[128:53.23]Should've just left you.
[128:59.50]You're supposed to drink the orange juice part.
[129:18.54]Okay.
[129:19.70]Where's the bathroom?
[129:22.60]Save point is behind me.
[129:25.55]I think we just have to get through this.
[129:35.05]Reload?
[129:36.05]What, for somebody else to get stuck in a store and then two people die or one person dies?
[129:45.13]I'm not doing another reset.
[129:46.55]There we go.
[129:46.99]Here we are.
[129:47.61]Done.
[129:47.75]Temporary agreement.
[129:48.69]Let's talk.
[129:49.01]I'm at entrance plaza.
[129:50.17]Yes, I am.
[129:50.82]We're safe for now.
[130:06.16]Take what you need from the clothing store.
[130:07.60]You got it.
[130:08.12]Alright.
[130:09.94]Here, Bert.
[130:11.72]Give me that.
[130:12.42]Drink that.
[130:14.02]Give me this.
[130:14.44]Oh, it's cooking oil.
[130:15.36]Okay, whatever.
[130:18.21]I don't know why my brain is like this.
[130:19.77]I thought that said one of seven killed in the corner.
[130:28.01]Okay.
[130:29.83]I am going to go and get some fresh clothing.
[130:33.45]What is that?
[130:36.35]We have to go... We have to walk all the way around.
[130:41.79]Save the game.
[130:42.59]But... Where is... I don't even know where the save point is.
[130:46.10]We just have to... I have to just go there.
[130:53.70]Just follow Brad.
[130:58.30]He doesn't know.
[130:59.99]If only there was a map.
[131:00.89]Yeah, but the save points are like... Here, look.
[131:04.23]Okay.
[131:05.25]So if I go up...
[131:08.02]I guess I could... I have to go this way.
[131:11.90]So, no, I am going this way.
[131:13.02]I can save.
[131:16.99]I'm saving the game.
[131:21.61]I can't even go this way.
[131:25.27]I'm gonna piss my pants, speaking of pissing.
[131:32.40]No, I... Everyone was like, you got it.
[131:34.16]You have to just do the thing.
[131:35.28]You have to go the right... You have to go this way.
[131:42.86]Go to the running guy icon on the map?
[131:49.49]I mean, what the fuck does that do?
[131:51.47]There's a save point right here.
[131:57.01]Otto?
[131:57.56]Otto's in here with me.
[132:02.24]I don't have that.
[132:02.98]Why are you guys giving me bogus info?
[132:13.41]Okay, where's the save point?
[132:14.39]It's right here.
[132:14.71]Alright.
[132:17.57]Let's just flex him.
[132:19.46]Make it to flex him.
[132:21.28]Alright, let's go.
[132:24.66]Move it.
[132:27.74]Did he just trip?
[132:31.87]Oh, God.
[132:33.83]No, you know what, Aaron?
[132:35.45]You come over here.
[132:37.73]Give me that bat.
[132:38.69]You're useless with that thing.
[132:42.85]My god, you are so useless.
[132:45.01]Just go ahead, stand there.
[132:47.51]Give me the bat!
[132:48.53]These guys are so bad!
[132:52.47]Give me your bat!
[132:53.75]Give me the bat.
[132:54.31]You take the cooking oil.
[132:55.89]I wanted to... Take the cooking oil.
[133:01.10]I don't care what you do with it.
[133:02.06]Just fuck off.
[133:03.20]Come on!
[133:05.22]Come on!
[133:10.38]Follow me!
[133:14.87]Alright, where's Flexin'?
[133:17.05]Come on.

[133:25.40]Almost at level six.
[133:30.67]Alright, Flexin'.
[133:37.21]Time to save the game.
[133:47.68]Guys?
[133:49.12]Are they dead?
[133:49.68]They're just standing around in circles bumping into stuff.
[133:53.18]Look at their icons.
[133:53.68]Just in case.
[133:54.68]Alright, where you guys at?
[134:26.81]What are you guys doing?
[134:33.06]Is he holding?
[134:33.96]What is he holding?
[134:40.94]There's only so much I can do!
[134:47.45]You guys are just walking into stuff!
[134:59.64]Like do these guys just die?
[135:01.44]Like why is this so difficult?
[135:06.04]Oh fuck the both of you.
[135:07.21]What is going on right now?
[135:21.48]Frank!
[135:21.88]I need help over here!
[135:22.78]Frank!
[135:23.62]Frank!
[135:23.94]Oh, I'm just walking into walls!
[135:25.46]Frank!
[135:26.64]Frank!
[135:28.00]Frank, help me!
[135:28.68]Oh, fuck you, Bert.
[135:33.88]What a waste of time.
[135:46.95]God damn it, man.
[135:50.54]It doesn't even make any fucking sense.
[135:55.36]Well, I di- Now I have no one.
[135:58.18]Before I had Leia.
[136:06.41]Ayayay.
[136:08.17]What is it?
[136:09.65]Frank, you're on the food court.
[136:10.99]Yep.
[136:12.91]Okay.
[136:14.59]Try mixing different food in the blenders.
[136:25.41]Mix the food in the blenders.
[136:26.95]I mean, this is... Oh, where's the blender?
[136:31.31]There's actually a lot of wine here.
[136:44.76]Microwave?
[136:46.83]Oh, I can cook food?
[136:47.83]This is strange.
[136:48.57]Okay, I don't see a blender.
[136:56.31]On the other side?
[137:00.04]I can't believe everybody's dead.
[137:07.18]Corn?
[137:08.58]Zucchini?
[137:12.06]No, okay.
[137:14.54]Any blenders?
[137:19.16]Uh, another store, maybe?
[137:20.60]I'll check another store.
[137:27.47]taco shop right here.
[137:28.39]I mean, a coffee shop would have a blender, wouldn't it?
[137:32.75]Oh, is it blender?
[137:36.26]Okay.
[137:38.24]Examine.
[137:42.00]Juice power.
[137:43.16]Insert two food items into a mixer and you can create your own original juice concoction.
[137:47.88]Different colored juices possess different properties and effects.
[137:52.16]What?
[137:54.02]So...
[137:59.05]Um... I need to get different ju... What just came up?

[138:18.66]Pick it up.
[138:21.22]Perfect.
[138:25.67]Perfect.
[138:27.94]Alright.
[138:28.67]So, is this just temporary?
[138:30.45]This is just temporary thing, right?
[138:32.81]That's cool.
[138:33.39]I'll figure out some stuff to do later.
[138:38.95]Mixed drinks will fully heal you.
[138:40.67]Oh, okay.
[138:41.11]That's cool.
[138:44.52]First step is super useful.
[138:49.80]Um, I'll have to figure that out later when I have more health.
[138:53.54]Put corn in there?
[138:54.28]Oh, wait.
[138:56.94]What's this?
[138:57.88]Yogurt.
[138:58.32]Okay, yogurt.
[139:00.42]Yogurt and ice pops.
[139:09.51]What'd I get?

[139:25.45]Alright, I gotta go.
[139:38.84]Yeah, this is Frank!
[139:42.30]Space Rider Machine in Wonderland Pizza looks like it's out of control.
[139:46.02]Maybe there's somebody out there.
[139:56.71]Go there.
[140:00.59]I'm just gonna let it talk.
[140:02.91]I know, it's a po- I know, let- I'm talking about the phone.
[140:05.53]Okay.
[140:12.25]I'm using the dumbbell as a phone.
[140:17.83]Use the quick step?
[140:21.67]Alright, I'll save Sophie.
[140:24.29]Maybe not.
[140:24.69]Should I do the quick step?
[140:27.39]What does it do?
[140:27.97]Let me see what it does.
[140:30.99]Holy shit, that's unbelievable.
[140:33.81]Oh my god, this is the best thing ever.
[140:41.93]Sophie, come here.
[140:44.53]Let's go, come here.
[140:46.05]Can you run as fast as me?
[140:47.13]Take one!
[140:50.27]What?
[140:52.01]Do I go faster?
[140:52.73]I can't just take hold of her and just drag and run?
[141:00.60]No, go this way.
[141:01.14]They're in the thing.
[141:01.89]Where are they driving to?
[141:19.89]Can they shoot that far?
[141:22.77]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we have made it to the portion where I've had to rewind to now.
[141:37.36]Alright, we're good.
[141:37.76]This way.
[141:48.76]PepoDance.
[141:49.80]This is kind of a PepoDance, isn't it?
[141:57.89]Just open the door.
[141:59.95]Alright, let's go.
[142:02.67]Come here.
[142:03.43]Alright, where's the save?
[142:12.90]Save point!
[142:15.40]is to the left and down the hall.
[142:27.31]Do I even have any weapons?
[142:32.34]Pretty good dodges.
[142:55.85]I don't have any fucking items.
[142:57.39]Oh, yes, I do.
[142:58.59]Come here.
[143:08.04]Just go to the... whatever.
[143:19.65]I need to close.
[143:22.31]Anything in the urinals?
[143:27.21]Come here.
[143:28.55]I don't even need to hold your hand.
[143:30.07]Why am I doing that?
[143:32.71]Okay, we're good?
[143:39.90]Fucking itchy eyeball.
[143:44.22]Nice push.
[143:55.84]I have no weapons now.
[143:56.90]Bad.
[144:00.30]Give me that back.
[144:03.40]Let's go.
[144:05.60]Alright, now I gotta go to the safe zone.
[144:10.27]Which is... Hold her hand.
[144:12.19]She's alert.
[144:13.29]She'll be fine.
[144:14.33]Alright, safe zone is... Down this way.
[144:19.13]Okay, I think that's just where we're going.
[144:22.18]Let's go.
[144:29.94]Nice hit.
[144:34.34]I washed my hands.
[144:36.43]There's no time for that.
[144:39.43]I'm sorry guys, but in a scenario like this... You're gonna wash your hands?
[144:44.33]You're not gonna go to the bathroom to pee.
[144:48.76]You're just gonna go over there and just piss all over the wall.
[144:51.28]As fast as you possibly can.
[144:54.18]You're still gonna use the bathroom?
[145:02.79]Good?
[145:04.01]Alright, this way.
[145:04.53]Alright, there's the exit.
[145:08.81]Let's go.
[145:15.73]Damn.
[145:16.75]Not washing hands is exactly how a zombie apocalypse starts.
[145:21.07]But if it's already happening, then there's no... It's already over.
[145:26.64]Shit.
[145:35.39]Got it.
[145:46.45]You killed them!
[145:48.75]Whoa!
[145:52.91]What in the hell is going on around here?
[146:03.52]Ooh, what a... The plot is developing right in front of us.
[146:09.22]There is a zombie playing host to a queen parasite in every large gathering of zombies.
[146:13.79]Defeat that zombie and get your hands on the queen to use it as an item.
[146:18.31]Queen infected zombie.
[146:20.01]Capture the queen.
[146:21.51]So they're the ones with the red eyes?
[146:25.41]Found a couple of those survivors in the bookstore in Wonderland Plaza.
[146:28.59]What is that thing?
[146:30.31]They look Japanese, probably tourists.
[146:31.92]Okay.
[146:33.59]Alright, let's go.
[146:35.05]Follow me.
[146:42.03]I brought somebody.
[146:42.66]I got a survivor.
[146:43.92]Oh, Queen!
[146:48.18]Get out of the way!
[146:54.93]This guy just puked in my mouth.
[147:03.72]Hold on, I want to get a good one of that.
[147:11.23]Turn around and do a big shove.
[147:14.85]And action.
[147:20.68]Turn around and shove the zombie.
[147:23.44]Go for it.
[147:34.19]She just pushed me.
[147:46.44]Every time I put the camera down, give me the queen.
[147:51.36]Whatever.
[147:51.66]Let's go.
[147:56.51]I'm taking this.
[148:03.84]Alright.
[148:05.50]I have somebody to deliver.
[148:14.52]Oops.
[148:17.06]Do I get money if it's a fake person?
[148:18.81]What if it's just a mannequin?
[148:21.47]And then I can save the game.
[148:22.33]There we are.
[148:25.73]Let's go.
[148:29.21]Sophie Richards.
[148:30.49]I can't believe those maniacs killed him.
[148:31.89]I never got the chance to tell how I feel.
[148:35.04]Very good.
[148:35.66]Escort complete.
[148:36.40]Level 7 reached.
[148:38.66]24,000 PP.
[148:39.06]Level up.
[148:42.34]Extra life cube.
[148:43.32]Nice.
[148:45.15]Alright, this is the next part of the game.
[148:52.31]Oh, that P. So that's what Dr. Barnaby said, huh?
[148:56.62]The old coot's not dumb.
[148:58.50]He wants us to call for help first.
[149:00.68]We gotta line out or what?
[149:09.16]The signal's being blocked.
[149:10.88]I can't even contact HQ on the emergency line.
[149:14.26]Still in the same costume.
[149:15.18]I was right.
[149:15.82]We want to get our hands on Dr. Barnaby.
[149:17.59]We're going to have to secure a way out of here ourselves.
[149:21.25]Alright.
[149:21.95]We've got to deal with the situation we've been handed.
[149:24.87]The boneheads back at HQ might be working on something, too.
[149:30.04]There's a thing to save every single person, right?
[149:33.30]Can you imagine how annoying that would be?
[149:37.32]At noon, it's my ride.
[149:40.72]Is your ride reliable?
[149:42.66]Absolutely.
[149:43.99]That's how I plan on getting out of here.
[149:48.01]Alright, then.
[149:49.65]I'll see to it that the DHS picks up the charter fee.
[149:52.31]Can we take Dr. Barnaby as well?
[149:54.21]Sure.
[149:55.61]As long as you tell me what's going on.
[149:58.02]OK.
[149:59.10]I'll tell you what you want to know later.
[150:02.20]We have more pressing business right now.
[150:03.80]Alright.
[150:05.75]How much money would it take me to save everybody?
[150:07.21]It just wouldn't happen.
[150:08.73]Alright, that's the first case completed.
[150:11.49]The next case will occur at 6 a.m.
[150:31.87]Oh, man.
[150:32.55]What time is it?
[150:34.23]Okay, so I got some time.
[150:35.03]Alright, I need to save the game, then I have to pee.
[150:44.41]No, it's out the other way.
[150:48.63]This way.
[150:49.71]Why is my eye so itchy?
[150:51.25]I want, like, a new pair of eyes.
[150:58.99]Let's go pee on the wall, quick.
[151:03.15]Alright, we're good.
[151:04.25]Image in the monitor.
[151:05.48]Oh, right.
[151:05.86]Alright, I'll be right back.
[151:08.58]I'm just going to pee.
[151:09.58]I'll be a minute, two minutes.
[151:12.33]See you in a second.
[155:05.46]Okay.
[155:06.56]Crisis averted.
[155:10.75]Where I was.
[155:11.29]Okay.
[155:19.13]Alright, so I have some time.
[155:20.51]Should I go for it?
[155:23.25]No, you can't even do it.
[155:25.78]What about, like, food and shit?
[155:28.74]Don't they leave stuff lying around?
[155:29.82]Okay.
[155:34.76]Didn't wash hands.
[155:35.72]I had enough time to do that.
[155:39.60]There's Jeff and Natalie.
[155:41.74]See, I'm saving people.
[155:43.84]I'm not doing terrible.
[155:46.58]Alright, I think I'm good.
[155:51.33]Yeah, there's nothing else in.

[156:22.10]You might want to consider spending the night here.
[156:23.60]Okay.
[156:27.34]Image in the monitor.
[156:29.46]Kind of running out of time on this one.
[156:33.52]Image in the monitor.

[160:32.88]Engineering.
[160:34.66]The act of holding a book is enough to activate its properties.

[160:58.63]Restorative power of food consumption is boosted with heal plus.
[161:02.66]Multiple books can be held in tandem to further increase the bonus.

[165:45.52]Bowling balls?
[165:47.86]I can't pick up the bowling balls?
[165:50.79]Alright, sporting goods.

[168:16.91]There's clearly something wrong with this man.
[168:18.31]Wait, I know Japanese.
[168:20.17]She'll hear you.
[168:20.89]I know Japanese.
[168:23.03]Don't worry, his Japanese sucks.
[168:24.19]He won't understand.
[168:25.91]We can't very well stay here by ourselves, can we?
[168:28.67]Let's just follow him for now, but remain suspicious of his tricks.
[168:32.80]This is all your fault.
[168:34.32]Of all the places to vacation, why were you so keen on this dump?
[168:38.12]What?
[168:38.44]You're the one who said it would be a good time.

[169:28.96]I don't have an option to.
[169:29.72]Because I don't have the Japanese book on me anymore.
[169:34.26]I can't talk.
[169:35.99]Where the hell is the Japanese book?
[169:41.89]There it is.

[170:52.88]Like, seriously.
[170:53.44]I, I, I, you know, I know what this does, by the way.
[170:57.52]I remember watching somebody play this, like, ten years ago, and I know what this does.
[171:00.95]It's like a grenade.
[171:04.39]Alright, I gotta bring, um, let's see, what time is it?
[171:08.69]1.30, I have to 6 to do, I can only do, what do I have here?

[171:20.42]It's time to save, save.
[171:21.46]Yeah, save the game.
[171:24.82]Anywhere I can do this?
[171:30.62]Where's the nearest save point?
[171:32.50]I'm gonna have to go down and then behind.
[171:36.33]Downstairs and then around.
[171:40.01]What's faster?
[171:40.67]This way or that way?
[171:41.39]Probably this way.

[171:49.24]There's a gun.
[171:50.80]Wait!
[171:55.12]I probably need to talk to him again.
[172:00.70]The one thing that's actually kind of hard for me to get used to is how left trigger is not aim gun.
[172:05.23]Left trigger is aim camera.
[172:06.97]Right trigger is aim gun.
[172:09.09]What the fuck did I just do?
[172:17.94]You good?

[172:57.65]How many shoe stores does this mall have?
[173:00.77]Like, half of the stores are shoe stores.
[173:19.03]Oh god.
[173:20.17]Here, you take the gun.
[173:32.55]You do it.
[173:37.11]He's got a knife.
[173:41.37]Give me the knife.
[173:44.01]Let's go.
[173:56.14]Clearing a path.
[173:59.38]Here, you take this knife.
[174:04.86]Whatever, just take... You guys, anybody take a knife.

[174:52.41]Out of control.
[174:53.03]There's still plenty of time.
[174:58.75]Where the roller coaster is a shortcut.
[175:03.19]Well, I'm already almost there.
[175:05.79]Like, I'm going to the save point over here.
[175:07.45]Or is it this way, right?
[175:15.61]Yes.
[175:16.53]This way to the right, and the save point's right there.

[176:31.89]This is horrible.
[176:33.61]I need to go to a restaurant or something.
[176:38.81]Alright, the gym is right here.
[176:45.29]Help me!
[176:53.72]Alright.
[176:54.66]Cool.
[176:55.48]I'm gonna get this.
[176:57.73]You know what?
[176:58.09]Fuck it.
[176:59.23]I think I know what this does.
[177:00.25]Let's do it.
[177:03.11]That is what it does.
[177:03.69]I knew it.
[177:05.99]Okay, now I have to... I'm dead.
[177:13.40]I'm dead.
[177:14.08]I gotta go back.
[177:18.18]I went the wrong way.
[177:19.42]I'm dead.
[177:20.02]Goodbye.
[177:31.99]Wasted the bees?
[177:32.70]I don't care.
[177:39.73]Did you guys not make it through?
[178:00.54]You guys are fucking useless!
[178:02.58]I'm just gonna let everybody die, who cares?
[178:06.10]Is this even the right one?
[178:23.01]They just stand there and let the zombies hit them.
[178:31.24]Look at all this extra work I have to do.
[178:32.93]I have like a case to solve.
[178:35.83]They're not going to get out of this.
[178:47.42]You know, the amount of times that you've cupped your hand to say help me, you could have shot the gun five times.
[179:05.60]You guys have weapons.
[179:08.56]Use them.
[179:11.54]Let's go.
[179:11.96]Go, go, go.
[179:13.70]Over here.
[179:14.08]Are you close enough?
[179:17.80]Holy sheep shit.
[179:22.07]I'm dead.
[179:35.29]What happened to my watch?
[179:39.63]Why is nothing selected?
[179:40.47]I have to clear a path for them to walk in a straight line.
[179:54.32]Oh, fuck the both of you.
[180:01.79]Come on.
[180:02.55]Here.
[180:02.73]I want you to have a drink.
[180:07.66]I'm certain I would do better in a zombie apocalypse than everybody in this game.
[180:11.66]Like 1000%.
[180:12.62]A million percent positive.
[180:23.65]Who cares?
[180:23.97]I don't even want you to have a weapon.
[180:29.67]Okay, let's go.
[180:47.01]You definitely wouldn't.
[180:47.65]You have no geography physics intuition whatsoever.
[180:52.35]Are you actually saying that in a video game, when I'm walking around a mall, that I don't know how to, like, drive my car around this city that I live in?
[181:02.38]What?
[181:10.88]Wait, where the fuck are we going right now?
[181:14.90]What is going on?
[181:17.19]Oh, it's out this way.
[181:18.07]Alright, I've got stuff like fucking fighting chat!
[181:21.03]I'm dead.
[181:21.31]Yeah guys, during the zombie apocalypse I'm just gonna get up and sprint as fast as I can and ram my body into the wall and knock myself unconscious and die.
[181:34.73]That's what's gonna happen.
[181:35.89]We'll let that be the canon.
[181:46.76]I'm so sick of babysitting these two.
[181:50.80]I'm multi-boxing on three accounts right now.
[182:00.83]My fucking god!
[182:02.83]What are you letting him do this for?!
[182:04.81]Jesus Christ!
[182:20.08]Just run and call them?
[182:20.96]That's what I was doing!
[182:21.98]Follow me!
[182:23.66]Follow me!
[182:24.52]Follow me!
[182:25.36]Come on!

[182:38.97]Over there!
[182:39.81]Follow me!
[182:40.72]No, not you.
[182:41.40]The guy... Come on!
[182:43.56]Follow me!
[182:44.46]We're dead.
[182:46.02]We're fucking dead.
[182:47.10]Are you serious?
[182:48.06]I have to go through the...
[182:50.92]Oh, we're dead!
[182:51.76]We're dead!
[182:53.10]There's no way!
[182:54.02]Just run!
[182:54.90]Go!
[182:55.26]Go!
[182:55.48]Stop running into walls, you fucking... Holy shit!
[183:01.17]There's no way I'm gonna make this back!
[183:03.69]There's no way!
[183:04.51]Not a chance in hell!
[183:05.85]They're both dead!
[183:06.69]What a waste of time, this one!
[183:11.99]God, Jesus Christ!
[183:15.25]You gotta be kidding me!
[183:20.05]I need a shortcut.
[183:21.09]How do I unlock a shortcut?
[183:37.56]Oh my god.
[183:44.22]How the hell am I going to do this with these two?
[183:53.72]Do the roller coaster shortcut?
[183:56.20]No, pick it.
[183:57.96]Somebody, help me.
[184:01.36]Oh my god.
[184:03.34]Come on.
[184:04.72]Follow me.
[184:24.78]So you're saying go back to the... I don't think this is humanly possible to get these guys across with what I have right now.
[184:34.66]Go to the gun store and get a gun.
[184:36.28]So I have to leave these guys to die.
[184:37.62]Because they just stand around and die.
[184:45.63]Use the bee?
[184:46.31]Everyone got mad at me when I used it last time.
[184:51.59]I'm just gonna use it, I don't care.
[184:53.47]Oh, he's dead.
[185:01.58]Please!
[185:03.24]Kill me, so I can redo this.
[185:06.94]Oh my god, it's such a mess.
[185:10.31]HELP!
[185:10.93]HELP ME!
[185:11.61]Are you still alive over there?
[185:28.68]Across from the gym is Home Depot.
[185:30.26]Alright, I'm gonna go to Home Depot.
[185:37.76]Come.
[185:38.31]This way.
[185:41.89]Get in here.
[185:42.45]Both of you.
[185:44.17]Go!
[185:47.05]Here, take one of these.
[185:49.31]I can't give this to you?
[185:55.33]Is it already broken?
[185:56.03]Alright, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way.
[185:59.86]Back, back, back, back, back.
[186:02.94]Oh my god, we're fucked.
[186:05.66]Okay, I need to have weapons here.
[186:07.04]I've got skill up for this.
[186:16.23]I dropped it.
[186:20.61]Everything I have is fucking broken.
[186:25.97]Okay.
[186:30.27]I need to fill up on shit.
[186:31.61]What do we have here?
[186:32.23]Toolbox, propane, 2x4.
[186:38.90]I really, really need health.
[186:44.58]Only God knows what the hell that is.
[186:46.14]Alright.
[186:54.60]At least it's not a total shitshow right now.
[187:02.71]Alright, what else have we got?
[187:03.67]Anywhere else?
[187:06.61]There he is.
[187:11.17]Alright, then we need to go... Let me look at the map.
[187:17.01]So the save point here... Everyone keeps telling me to go to the guy that's running.
[187:22.96]Go to the, go to the, the instant message logo.
[187:24.97]Aim, aim logo.
[187:25.97]Okay.
[187:27.01]I'll do it.
[187:28.69]It's like, every time I look over here, everyone's yelling at me to do this.
[187:37.35]Alright, here.
[187:37.89]You take this.
[187:38.93]How many, are there any more 2x4s?
[187:39.81]Yeah, like, lead pipe.
[187:44.89]Good.
[187:45.39]Lead pipe.
[187:46.94]Plenty of weapons.
[187:47.64]Here.
[187:47.82]You don't even have a knife?
[187:53.08]Here, take the lead pipe.
[187:54.40]It's much better.
[187:58.11]What else is in here?
[188:06.31]No, I don't want that.
[188:09.51]Sledgehammer?
[188:10.17]Where's the sledgehammer?
[188:16.80]Rake.
[188:17.74]Shovel.
[188:18.88]Oh, here it is.
[188:19.84]Okay.
[188:21.91]Okay.
[188:22.99]You ready?
[188:30.56]Let's go to the instant message logo.
[188:36.70]Bang a left and then bang a right.
[188:52.70]I need health or I'm gonna die.
[188:56.04]Fuck.
[188:57.61]God damn it.
[188:58.57]This guy with the gun keeps shooting me.
[189:04.45]He shot me like five times.
[189:16.84]Left.
[189:17.12]Let's go.
[189:22.20]Dude, there are so many motherfuckers down here.
[189:24.70]There's so many people here.
[189:34.41]What?!
[189:46.03]Don't even give me this jebaited bullshit.
[189:49.78]Fuck.
[189:50.36]Now what do I do?
[189:58.43]I'm in trouble.
[190:08.62]Okay.
[190:10.18]I have to go heal.
[190:12.04]Oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[190:17.02]I don't remember this game being this difficult.
[190:23.24]Don't, please!
[190:26.19]Did they increase the amount of enemies on the screen?
[190:29.24]In like the PC version?
[190:36.90]Maybe it's because I was throwing CDs at people.
[190:39.04]Well, they're just dead.
[190:40.62]There is no physical way I can save those people.
[190:45.75]Impossible.
[190:46.77]No way I could do that right there.
[190:59.33]Holy shit.
[191:06.18]I'm dead.
[191:08.12]So, what have we learned?
[191:09.52]We've learned that this was a mistake to come this way, and I'm going to go the other way and go to the rollercoaster.
[191:15.08]That's my only option at the moment.
[191:18.89]I don't even care if these guys die.
[191:26.73]Give me a hand here.
[191:31.33]I'm gonna go get a weapon, and good luck.
[191:33.95]Good luck, you two.
[191:39.20]I think I'm wasting too much time trying to take care of every single person I come across when no fucking way.
[191:46.89]They just die.
[191:47.55]Who cares?
[192:04.77]Give me the gun.
[192:07.99]Here, you can have this.
[192:10.53]What?
[192:10.97]No.
[192:11.45]Where's the gun?
[192:12.21]Give me the gun.
[192:14.80]Give me the gun.
[192:15.28]Come on!
[192:16.18]Come on!
[192:41.05]I'm going to get heals Holy shit I'm not gonna shoot this guy
[192:59.69]I'm gonna... I could have healed the other guy too.
[193:01.60]Is he dead?
[193:03.56]Whatever.
[193:07.08]Come here.
[193:09.94]Well, the other guy was just standing and letting the zombies fucking punch him in the face.
[193:15.73]That's been what the survivors do this whole game.
[193:20.47]This please hurt me.
[193:23.85]Taking more.
[193:26.86]Okay, let's go.
[193:40.42]We can do it.
[193:42.14]Wait.
[193:44.00]He got out of the way.
[194:17.69]Did he not make it?
[194:18.81]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[194:31.70]Fuck him.
[194:32.10]I don't even care.
[194:46.05]Not gonna need that book anymore.
[194:51.71]Okay, here we go.
[194:52.63]Hey, I'm at the roller coaster, what's here?
[194:54.89]Rover?
[195:15.88]It's a car.
[195:19.47]Everyone used to laugh at me.
[195:24.25]I was a walking punchline.
[195:27.73]This is a shortcut on the roller coaster.
[195:30.07]I just want to make sure we understand.
[195:32.02]That's what everyone told me to do.
[195:33.84]I'm never listening to chat ever again.
[195:37.49]Do I have to fight this guy?
[195:42.25]I don't- Jesus.
[196:12.07]I have to kill this guy.
[196:27.38]Whoa!
[196:29.42]Okay, run him over.
[196:30.12]Run him over with the car.
[196:30.72]Run him over with the car.
[196:31.32]Got it.
[196:31.50]Already figured it out.
[196:32.44]I already know what to do.
[196:33.44]I win.
[196:52.67]I did it!
[196:53.91]Technically.
[196:54.45]Shit.
[196:59.53]I'm all the way back here.
[197:03.55]Not good.
[197:04.58]Not good.
[197:06.12]This is not good.
[197:09.94]Oh, boy.
[197:10.70]This is gonna be fun.
[197:12.88]With me.
[197:19.31]With me, with me, with me!
[197:26.31]Fuck the hardware store.
[197:28.53]Don't read the book.
[197:31.78]Nice shot.
[197:32.36]Alright.
[197:33.00]I can keep you guys both around.
[197:34.98]Will they help me during this?
[197:39.00]Okay, both of you, come on.
[197:45.91]We got some drinking to do.
[197:47.77]Heals.
[197:52.99]Come here.
[197:54.21]Take this.
[197:56.12]Give me the gun.
[197:59.41]Oh, no, no, no, no, don't worry!
[198:00.65]I'll take care of it.
[198:03.25]You idiot.
[198:11.63]Here, drink.
[198:14.39]Drink, drink, drink, drink.
[198:15.48]You can do it.
[198:15.94]There you are.
[198:18.74]All you have to do is walk up the stairs.
[198:22.33]It's really easy.
[198:23.27]Just walk up the stairs.
[198:25.17]You guys are just bait.
[198:26.63]Just drink the wine.
[198:33.05]Okay.
[198:33.57]Give me the knife.
[198:36.09]I need... I need to bring a hit.
[198:40.40]No, you die in one hit anyways from the clown.
[198:42.78]Here we go.
[198:48.38]Follow me!
[198:49.30]Follow me!
[198:56.56]Up and in the way.
[199:01.44]Alright, stay with me.
[199:04.81]This time, don't get lost.
[199:08.53]Come on.
[199:27.09]Good?
[199:28.59]Okay, here we go.
[199:30.61]I need to get prepared for this though.
[199:31.67]Is there anything else down here?
[199:32.47]There's probably something I can take, like a bigger, better... Could be like a better weapon down here.
[199:53.10]Alright, this is... I just dyed my hair.
[199:56.38]Okay, I'm looking for something strong.
[200:02.69]That's a prop.
[200:05.65]It's not... Is that tuber?
[200:06.55]No, it's not tuber here.
[200:07.35]Just because you said that, I have to change it back.
[200:15.55]Yeah, I need something else.
[200:20.09]Alright.
[200:22.09]So...
[200:24.01]How am I going to kill this guy?
[200:28.67]Save the game.
[200:30.19]Is there a save spot down here?
[200:32.50]There is.
[200:32.78]Okay.
[200:33.08]All the way down here, we're going to save it.
[200:42.54]Trade that knife out.
[200:43.94]Still good.
[200:48.65]Let's get the game saved.
[201:02.49]Good.
[201:07.07]Finally, you guys have a shred of intelligence.
[201:24.46]This can't open.
[201:26.50]A maintenance key to open these.
[201:28.97]Fuck.
[201:32.69]Okay, let's keep going.
[201:33.39]Save the game.
[201:35.53]I'm in a much better position with this health, though.
[201:48.36]Just take it slow.
[201:49.44]No reason to go fast.
[201:54.20]You're gonna die in two hits.
[202:00.01]Yeah, I know, but at least I'm gonna die in two hits and not one.
[202:06.89]What?
[202:07.65]Oh.
[202:16.07]Good.
[202:17.96]I'm swimming through this guy.
[202:24.26]So now the game is saved.
[202:25.44]Is it worth it?
[202:26.22]Should I... Okay, I'm going up there.
[202:27.58]Good.
[202:32.98]You can be the one that shoots.
[202:34.12]I'm just gonna trail him around.
[202:38.45]Okay, here we go Throw some jewels at him.
[202:58.32]I don't think that's a great idea good.
[203:00.12]Come on.
[203:01.48]Alright, oh handgun
[203:12.13]Handgun, handgun, handgun.
[203:14.13]Okay, cool.

[203:19.71]Wait, everybody take a handgun.
[203:21.26]Take one.
[203:22.70]We're gonna do this together.
[203:24.18]Look, if we light him up, he can't do anything.
[203:27.04]If we fire three guns at him at the same time, he's dead.
[203:29.38]Don't aim at me.
[203:35.55]Okay, you ready?
[203:36.05]Three guns.
[203:44.69]I don't care if you miss.
[203:45.69]You're at least a distraction.
[203:48.35]So where am I?
[203:49.01]I just have to run back here.
[203:49.99]I'm going to light him up.
[203:59.78]Good.
[204:01.08]This way.

[204:18.61]There we go.
[204:19.99]Shoot him!
[204:30.06]He's blocking.
[204:30.80]He's blocking everything.
[204:32.04]Wait, is he coming?
[204:34.92]Oh!
[204:36.46]Shoot him!
[204:39.90]You can't shoot him.

[205:24.59]Shoot something!
[205:27.96]Oh, sorry!
[205:28.66]Light him up!
[205:42.38]Balloon!
[205:43.32]Follow, follow, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!
[205:47.10]Balloon!

[205:55.77]Run!
[205:56.07]This way!
[205:56.55]No!
[205:56.99]Get out of the way!
[206:01.31]Kill him!
[206:02.23]Somebody hit him!
[206:09.62]He was going in with the... He was going in with the dumbbell for the last hit.
[206:24.05]I freaked out.
[206:24.75]At least I got it.
[206:28.27]That was horrible.
[206:29.71]Hardest boss in the game?
[206:34.71]Psychopath defeated.
[206:36.35]Guys.
[206:37.71]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[206:38.47]Don't run away.
[206:40.59]Small chainsaw.
[206:44.47]You obtain the ID card.
[206:45.87]Okay.
[206:53.32]Excellent work.
[206:55.08]You two were worth saving.
[206:57.74]And... Let's go home.
[207:02.42]Get on the ride.
[207:16.93]Oh no, who's this?
[207:28.45]He just looks over and goes... Greg.
[207:34.52]Any other survivors around?
[207:35.52]Yes, there are.
[207:36.00]The three of us.
[207:38.62]I'm sure everyone's in the security room.
[207:39.92]It's safe there.
[207:41.86]We have to go.
[207:42.39]Security room?
[207:43.57]I know a shortcut there.
[207:46.61]Where is it, then?
[207:47.91]Great.
[207:48.73]I'd love for you to show us.
[207:50.83]Small... How many small chainsaws can I have?
[207:55.68]Uh...
[208:06.90]This way.
[208:07.38]Come on.
[208:09.56]Which way?
[208:12.42]I was ahead of you.
[208:16.83]Holy shit, this weapon is incredible.
[208:18.61]Wait, I could have done a PP there.
[208:25.37]Okay.
[208:35.77]This is so much better!
[208:40.91]Imagine playing the game with anything but this.
[208:42.47]Wait, there's some sass there.
[208:45.61]Hold on.
[208:46.99]Let's go.
[209:04.59]Come on.
[209:06.21]Uh, I don't- I- Will this instantly kill Greg?
[209:09.99]I'm so scared to accidentally kill somebody.
[209:13.45]I will instantly kill somebody if I hit them.
[209:16.29]Don't walk into me, please.
[209:18.05]This way!
[209:20.11]I got four of you.
[209:21.33]Shinji, let's go!
[209:23.47]This thing's gonna break!
[209:32.16]It's gonna break!
[209:45.74]You have another one?
[209:46.58]Yeah, but... Should I save it?
[209:51.93]You guys good?
[209:52.97]Shinji, uh-oh.
[209:54.71]Shinji, Shinji.
[210:02.05]I... Let's go.
[210:02.67]They respawned.
[210:09.53]Oh, fuck.
[210:11.70]Alright, get...
[210:19.36]Come on, you guys.
[210:25.83]Made it.
[210:27.83]Everybody?
[210:28.27]Do I have everybody?
[210:30.39]Just head through here and we're already at Paradise Plaza.
[210:32.39]Nice shortcut, huh?
[210:33.37]What do you mean, head through here?
[210:39.28]Oh.
[210:47.22]Oh, shit.
[210:47.87]Okay.

[211:04.09]Image in the monitor.
[211:04.77]We're almost there, right?
[211:09.01]Now we... Down here.
[211:11.87]Bang a left.
[211:16.42]Let's go.
[211:18.12]You guys aren't all stuck in the hallway, are you?
[211:21.12]One at a time.
[211:36.62]Okay, he's fine.
[211:37.54]I kind of, I just, I got him at the end.
[211:52.42]No, somebody's caught.
[211:54.06]Who is it?
[211:55.39]Shinji, again.
[211:56.87]Shinji, come.
[211:57.55]You're killing me, Shinji.
[211:58.67]You're killing me with this bullshit.
[212:03.15]Always you.
[212:07.89]Always you.
[212:09.23]Always.
[212:11.89]Be better.
[212:12.29]Good.
[212:25.93]Okay, now is it up or is it to the... I think it's straight ahead, right?
[212:31.11]Yeah, it's just this way.
[212:35.53]Stop running away from your problems.
[212:44.62]Okay.
[212:46.46]Does it follow the arrow?
[212:47.30]Yeah, I know, but sometimes it can be upstairs.
[212:53.33]Oh my god.
[212:58.73]No.
[212:59.35]Stop standing still!
[213:11.74]You idiot!
[213:16.93]Oh, you're gonna get me killed!
[213:28.06]Let's go!
[213:31.90]Oh shit, somebody get that.
[213:35.92]Go get it.
[213:37.48]I'm not doing this.
[213:39.78]I'm dead.
[213:40.08]They have to take care of it.
[213:50.50]You guys are useless.
[213:53.94]Absolutely useless.
[213:55.26]Don't shoot me with the gun.
[213:56.78]In fact, give me the gun.
[213:59.42]Here, you take the knife.
[214:01.50]You take the dumbbell.
[214:03.00]Give me the gun.
[214:04.36]Alright, I feel much safer now.
[214:06.25]Go in there.
[214:09.65]Alright, come on.
[214:34.47]God, I just, I would move, but I just don't have any health.

[215:34.01]Oh my god.
[215:35.11]That was horrible.
[215:40.78]Get up here.
[215:42.00]Nice jump.
[215:42.72]I got three survivors.
[215:43.94]I feel good about this.
[215:45.52]I did it!
[215:45.98]I'm honored that you helped me.
[215:50.04]Please accept my humble gratitude.
[215:53.10]Got them both.

[216:33.21]Image in the monitor.
[216:38.32]The zombies with berserk lights says I doubt the Professor is going anywhere until morning.
[216:42.97]Not this one?
[216:45.15]Might need to spend the night here.
[216:50.27]No, no!
[216:50.75]Okay, I... What?

[218:27.95]Yeah.
[218:28.53]I can't even throw a book over a fucking fence.
[218:38.34]Okay.
[218:40.46]So, let's do this.
[218:41.54]Rescue the professor.
[218:43.04]Shadow at the north of the plaza.
[218:45.96]Yeah.
[218:51.90]I didn't think that shit would happen to me when I first came in here.
[218:55.75]It's too late for that.
[218:56.49]Yeah, there's no way I'm doing that.
[219:00.49]Oh, there's Otis calling.
[219:10.34]Sorry, Otis.
[219:10.98]I'm running around.
[219:22.54]Alright, so I've got photo challenge, wherever that is, and then the professor one has to happen now.
[219:29.71]Alright, fine.
[219:31.23]Frank, looks like the shutter leading to the entrance plaza is open now.
[219:34.91]Maybe the guy dragging the old man around opened it.
[219:36.79]At any rate, you can get to the entrance plaza through Paradise Plaza now.
[219:39.87]Well, that's great.
[219:41.64]Look at that.
[219:58.78]Sniper?
[219:59.04]Oh, that's not good.
[219:59.66]Are you going to turn into a pair of pants, or are you actually going to help me this time?
[220:12.23]Baja Mama.
[220:34.32]Frank, that's not a sniper rifle.
[220:36.50]Ah, shit, that's right.
[220:39.76]Oh, great.
[220:42.32]This is gonna be wonderful.
[220:51.53]Good.
[221:04.15]I got chunks on my face.
[221:05.37]That's disgusting.
[221:11.41]Action shot.
[221:20.65]Okay, stay alive.
[221:22.67]I think I can do that.
[221:24.91]Can I get chips?
[221:26.81]Uh... Okay, I'm just gonna go this way.
[221:33.56]I'm coming to save you, Barnaby!
[221:37.22]Look, I'm blocking his vision.
[221:39.86]Good strategy.
[221:49.01]Alright, Barnaby.
[221:50.89]I'm here.
[222:03.19]That didn't work.
[222:13.26]Here!
[222:14.10]Catch!
[222:14.46]Actually, I need those.
[222:18.94]I need those.
[222:19.32]Can I shoot them?
[222:25.52]Sorry.
[222:27.05]Can I shoot the rope?
[222:37.97]That was really, really, really bad.
[222:43.39]Can you get off of me?
[222:46.31]Thanks for the help, dude.
[222:47.47]Appreciate it.
[222:49.28]Nice work.
[222:53.72]Well, I'm dead.
[223:04.79]Looks like I'm going up.
[223:09.47]Give me another, uh... Give me one of these.
[223:13.13]Do I run faster like this?
[223:14.17]Imagine turning around as Brad and seeing this.
[223:25.82]You would have no time to even react to this.
[223:27.48]You'd be like, what?
[223:29.48]What do you do?
[223:30.38]No, stop it, man.
[223:31.66]What's wrong?
[223:33.54]Holy shit, Brad.
[223:38.45]What?
[223:38.75]He's holding like a .50 caliber sniper rifle like this?
[223:41.75]Oh my god!
[223:44.55]That's awful!
[223:46.43]Brad!
[223:47.07]Just... Brad!
[223:51.72]Get some coffee creamer!
[223:53.74]Brad!
[224:09.39]Okay.
[224:15.09]So, I need to just go up there and kill that guy, I guess?
[224:23.97]I guess, I don't know.
[224:30.80]You guys both suck.
[224:33.86]I ran over to the professor and I thought I had to, like, cut him loose.
[224:54.74]I might need it later, Ankur.
[225:04.65]Don't get the chainsaws?
[225:06.99]Ooh, lead pipe.
[225:09.25]Nice.
[225:13.09]I can't take that call right now.
[225:21.04]So where was that shortcut?
[225:23.94]The chainsaws respawn.
[225:25.36]That's kind of insane.
[225:27.46]So, is this the shortcut that takes me down to here?
[225:31.12]Which is the right one?
[225:33.71]Can I now open these?
[225:40.39]Alright, so I'll go there.
[225:42.61]Can I do all those now, or do I have to have specific, like, keys?
[225:45.75]Right here.
[225:58.43]So glad I have more space.
[225:59.79]Alright, so then now I go straight this way.
[226:06.62]This game's fun.
[226:12.56]Alright, go ahead and tell me what you want to tell me.
[226:14.91]Alright, listen.
[226:23.78]Okay.
[226:24.58]Get a gun.
[226:26.68]No, no gun.
[226:28.12]Just a nightstick.
[226:29.58]Well, shit.
[226:35.94]Grab the chainsaw.
[226:37.66]How am I going to use the chainsaw against the guy with the sniper rifle?
[226:48.21]Don't.
[227:00.54]Alright.
[227:01.36]I think it's just to the right.
[227:03.36]It is.
[227:10.12]It's an early 360 game.
[227:11.43]Of course it's janky.
[227:14.01]That's alright, though.
[227:17.31]The game came out like 12, what, 10, 12 years ago?
[227:19.01]More than that.
[227:19.77]Like 14 years ago?
[227:32.01]Okay.
[227:32.63]Wonderland!
[227:33.99]Let's grab the chainsaw.
[227:38.84]Which is back over this way, right?
[227:44.12]What was that rollercoaster?
[227:47.52]That's the rollercoaster, right?
[227:58.01]Other way, pilot.
[228:03.28]You guys just bounced off that guy's hip?
[228:06.17]Oh, that's right.
[228:24.08]Are there two up here, or just one?
[228:28.64]Oh, actually, I'm with the guys.
[228:34.86]I wasn't even trying to do that, and he's gonna kill me.
[228:37.29]There's a lot of other motherfuckers over here.
[228:48.13]Ah!
[228:54.09]Oh, for the love of God.
[229:02.81]I'm gonna have to use the chainsaw to even get out of here.
[229:11.49]Bingo.
[229:11.89]Alright.
[229:13.21]Now, let's go... I can cut through here, can't I?
[229:16.30]How much fall damage is there in the game?
[229:18.20]A lot?
[229:18.76]How much is there?
[229:21.46]Barely any.
[229:21.90]Okay, now I want some more food.
[229:34.62]Why?
[229:34.98]That is such bullshit.
[229:37.42]I need food.
[229:42.91]I'm going through the food court.
[229:47.99]Ah, no, this thing sucks.
[229:48.65]I don't want it.
[229:52.90]Let's get rid of this.
[230:00.08]Alright.
[230:01.06]Chainsaw and knife.
[230:02.64]And then I want a bunch of food.
[230:04.88]Okay.
[230:05.83]Spot of two people holed up in one of the shoe stores in Wonderland Plaza.
[230:08.71]I can't do that right now.
[230:10.65]I'm sorry.
[230:12.77]Must be a couple.
[230:13.37]Looks like something's wrong.
[230:15.77]Oh, that's not a whole lot of time.
[230:19.69]Let's get three full heals.
[230:22.19]In fact, just eat this and get a bunch more.
[230:25.57]Okay, cool.
[230:26.90]Alright, I have four full heals, a knife, a gun, and a chainsaw.

[231:59.80]Recommended beverage.
[232:00.76]Nectar.

[232:44.23]Quick steps are not going to get you drunk.
[232:47.75]It's true.
[232:55.43]Okay, don't accidentally drink these.
[232:58.68]All I have is a gun.
[232:59.34]Let's go.
[233:06.17]So now I take the shortcut back.
[233:09.69]Wait, I need to save some of these.
[233:32.35]So I can go up here, right?
[233:34.85]Oh, should I save it?
[233:36.47]Save it and then go this way.
[233:38.29]That's what I'm doing.
[233:52.11]Yep.
[233:56.50]We've got a save.
[233:57.28]We've got a place to go back up.
[234:02.43]Oh, I pressed it.
[234:03.37]I did.
[234:03.81]I was just holding the gun to my head.
[234:05.47]I am now ready for the boss.
[234:21.12]Let's go.
[234:26.89]Go through the exit door, which is over here.
[234:30.79]Alright.
[234:32.39]OK.
[234:33.79]Check it.
[234:36.81]Yes, it is.
[234:44.88]I don't have that.
[235:00.09]I hear people screaming.
[235:02.87]Who is screaming right now?
[235:06.41]Here's the entrance plaza.
[235:18.50]What?
[235:20.90]This is... Holy shit, that's for real.
[235:26.89]I thought you guys were fucking with me.
[235:39.88]There we go.
[235:42.96]Okay.
[235:44.36]One.
[235:45.68]Two.
[235:47.37]Fast.
[235:49.71]And, Uzi.
[236:01.07]Hacker!
[236:02.11]Hacker!
[236:18.95]Yep.
[236:33.92]That, I just got, like, pre-fired.
[236:40.55]Oh fuck, he's gonna shoot me!
[236:45.46]Just chugging protein shakes.
[237:10.99]I should have a chainsaw in my hand.
[237:15.03]Brad!
[237:16.85]I'll be fine.
[237:19.12]Just take the other professor.
[237:20.98]Go.
[237:22.64]Can I pick up the sniper, I hope?
[237:29.19]He's unconscious, but alive.
[237:34.34]You're gonna have to carry me.
[237:45.65]And him.
[237:52.67]Just go.
[237:54.23]Go to the bike store.
[237:54.93]I'll get on the pegs.
[238:13.39]That's not a good way to carry somebody.
[238:15.31]You'd pull his arms out of his sockets.
[238:19.57]Carrying him by both of his shoulders.
[238:21.43]A fever.
[238:46.58]Yeah, that's what I said.
[238:53.32]Case 2.
[238:54.99]Case 2-3.
[238:55.63]Medi- Oh, God.
[238:59.97]I'm almost out of time.
[239:01.57]Holy shit, that's no time.
[239:02.79]No time, no time, no time, no time.
[239:04.11]I have to go now.
[239:04.57]I need to save it.
[239:06.19]I'm gonna be all hopped up on protein drinks.
[239:09.04]Save it and go.
[239:11.52]Okay.
[239:17.68]I would not hold your hand on the trigger and lie down on your chainsaw as a pillow.
[239:26.36]Alright.
[239:27.49]Run.
[239:28.41]I have to hurry up.
[239:32.69]I'm not gonna drink this yet.
[239:35.15]Not until I get out there.
[239:41.49]Medicine run.
[239:44.85]Mmm...
[240:09.31]Get out of my way.
[240:13.39]How many heals?
[240:14.77]Drink it!
[240:26.95]No, it slows me down!
[240:27.75]No, it doesn't.
[240:35.38]Get off the phone!
[240:38.91]God!
[240:39.51]Am I out of juice?
[240:52.11]Alright, I think I'm alright.
[240:56.07]I have to go this way?
[241:01.61]Do I really?
[241:02.27]What the fuck do I do?
[241:19.89]I hate these guys.
[241:31.70]Time until helicopter arrives.
[241:32.84]Where am I going?
[241:36.14]Frank!
[241:36.44]We made it to the North Plaza!
[241:39.42]Alright, I'm out.
[241:51.80]Tell me what you want.
[241:52.38]There's a supermarket there, along with a gun shop, a cutlery shop, and a home center.
[242:18.62]Every time Otis calls, take a shot.
[242:33.36]I would not suggest doing that.
[242:43.34]I need another weapon, just...
[242:55.44]Fuck.
[243:06.86]Alright.
[243:07.42]Food store.
[243:13.58]I can heal, right?
[243:16.08]Just... You're in the supermarket.
[243:18.31]I know.
[243:20.15]You can get to the pharmacy through the door between the butcher counter and the seafood counter.
[243:25.18]Good enough.
[243:33.66]Oh, this is fairly healthy.
[243:37.78]There's somebody inside the home and garden shop in Alfresca Plaza.
[243:40.98]I didn't get to look at him, but I'm pretty sure it was a man.
[243:42.84]Okay.
[243:46.18]He looks scared.
[243:48.97]Lettuce.
[243:54.45]Grapefruit.
[243:55.93]No, I need like apples.
[243:56.97]It's the thing that heals the most.
[244:00.39]I can make this into a smoothie, couldn't I?
[244:01.79]Okay, is there a save point?
[244:10.81]There is outside back here.
[244:12.27]Okay, I'm going to do that first because I have no idea what's going on in here.
[244:20.82]Lettuce and cooking oil for a smoothie?
[244:27.11]What time is it?
[244:29.27]2.15.
[244:29.31]What time does this end?
[244:40.25]2.16?
[244:44.62]What are you talking about?
[244:47.20]Are you serious?
[245:04.02]Did I make it?
[245:42.76]Okay.
[245:43.96]Person riding in grocery cart.
[245:46.62]Somebody pushing.
[245:47.30]We're gonna have to do, like, bumper cars?
[246:08.71]Ugh.
[246:18.79]He screamed so loud he disconnected my Xbox.
[246:20.95]Who's in the...
[246:41.76]Alright, so just throw a bunch of shit all over the place.
[246:47.78]Break everything in the store, throw everything on the ground, and he'll get stunned.
[246:51.13]Do I got it right?
[246:53.19]He looked like a puppet.
[247:03.57]Like somebody had the hand up his back.
[247:15.55]Oh, he has a gun too!
[247:16.39]He has a gun too!
[247:17.75]Alright, that doesn't work.
[247:19.23]It might.
[247:31.99]Holy shit, that was...
[247:45.29]Don't vandalize, right?
[247:46.37]He hates this.
[247:47.37]He's in the corner.
[248:06.11]How do I get him out of the corner?
[248:07.24]Oh, shit.
[248:12.52]Sneak?
[248:13.26]Sneak?
[248:13.96]Snack!
[248:23.99]Is he going this way?
[248:25.23]Alright, jump across and chainsaw.
[248:26.90]Ready, three, two, one, go!
[248:32.74]Did I do good or did I do bad?
[248:34.12]I can't tell.
[248:36.44]Got him.
[248:44.77]My store.
[248:47.89]My... store!
[248:55.30]Who will run my store when I'm gone?
[248:58.40]My store... My food... My sales... This guy's freaking me out.
[249:12.49]My... Customers...
[249:24.72]Don't shoot yourself in the head.
[249:45.75]I have to get a different clothes.
[249:48.33]I have the same shitty outfit on.
[250:00.47]Is my hair a different color?
[250:06.18]He's got a pretty sick Bugleberry jacket, though, I will say.
[250:28.64]Ooh, a key.
[250:30.18]Wait, I still have to...
[250:57.65]I have to hurry up now.
[250:58.95]Medicine run.
[251:01.27]How do I get in?
[251:03.07]Key?
[251:03.43]Use the key.
[251:03.88]Use the key?
[251:04.94]How do I get in this?
[251:06.74]How do I get inside?
[251:08.92]How do I get in the medicine store?
[251:11.06]How do I get in there?
[251:12.32]How do I get in there?
[251:21.43]Come on!
[251:27.93]Use the pharmacy key.
[251:30.03]First aid kit.
[251:32.23]I have to bring this back.
[251:34.22]All the way.
[251:35.26]In how much time?
[251:43.96]What do I need?
[251:44.37]Where's it going?
[251:49.55]I don't know.
[251:49.85]Should I go up the stairs?
[251:54.91]Use the cart.
[251:56.27]Okay, grab the cart and where am I going?
[251:59.12]Just follow the... cart.
[252:05.66]Okay, I have no time for this shit.
[252:06.88]I have to go.
[252:09.68]Cart and just run?
[252:10.52]You think I can make it?
[252:12.42]Okay.
[252:16.53]I didn't mean to do that.
[252:17.41]I was trying... No, I want to... I need to put this down.
[252:30.89]I can't leave with the cart!
[252:32.93]How do I leave with the cart?
[252:42.80]What?
[252:55.28]No, don't go over jumps, you idiot!
[252:57.87]It's not worth spending the time!
[253:20.05]Hurry, hurry, hurry, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[253:25.15]Go!
[253:28.54]No, no jump.
[253:30.48]What?
[253:30.80]What?
[253:36.20]Do I have to pick this up?
[253:37.82]Pick it up.
[253:43.27]Pick the card up!
[253:47.39]Wait, did I miss this?
[253:48.15]Did I miss a shortcut?
[254:03.79]Oh, I'm trying so hard to just get behind it.
[254:08.33]It's over.
[254:09.03]I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[254:16.34]Like, pick it up.
[254:17.02]Stand behind it.
[254:17.64]Pick it up.
[254:20.04]Fuck.
[254:22.42]I'm so angry right now.
[254:25.10]I'm gonna take the car.
[254:25.70]I'm gonna kill him and take the car.
[254:43.07]I can't believe it.
[254:44.17]That's what happens when you have the same button mapped to everything.
[254:52.17]They've learned since then.
[254:59.29]Out of the way.
[255:06.47]Get the fuck away from me.
[255:09.37]Okay.
[255:10.07]Where is it?
[255:13.04]Bang a left!
[255:15.50]No!
[255:16.12]Just go straight!
[255:22.69]Is there anything else I can go faster with?
[255:27.93]I wish I had that stupid shopping cart.
[255:30.61]I lost this shopping cart and that was a huge problem.
[256:10.18]Yeah
[256:33.46]Okay!
[256:41.88]Okay.
[256:47.32]The next case will occur at 11 a.m.
[256:48.72]Alright.
[256:54.64]The professor's passed.
[256:56.71]But... That's... Why is that so blocked out?
[257:02.75]Save it.
[257:03.11]Yep.
[257:07.35]Not that way.
[257:11.99]Not that way.
[257:16.13]Crap.
[257:18.53]Where am I going?
[257:19.27]I just... I'm coming down.
[257:22.32]You know when you're coming down after being really stressed out playing something and then your brain sort of starts to try to unwind?
[257:36.95]Alright, so I'm good.
[257:40.87]Free roam time.
[257:42.53]Thank you.
[257:43.27]Why don't you guys pose?
[257:46.11]No, I'm not on drugs.
[257:55.01]I'm talking about just when you... Don't matter.
[258:01.64]Alright, now look up.
[258:03.66]Give me... Sad.
[258:04.44]What?
[258:05.04]No, turn back around.
[258:10.45]I want a really good cinematic shot.
[258:37.10]Alright, stop wasting photos.
[258:57.75]Free roam.
[258:58.49]Not enough time.
[259:02.67]Yeah.
[259:04.23]I had enough time to go to the bathroom.
[259:08.19]Are you alright?
[259:10.17]You have blood on you.
[259:11.99]Huh?
[259:14.85]Oh, yeah.
[259:19.06]Must be from that girl I saved.
[259:20.64]Girl?
[259:22.08]Was she hurt?
[259:22.62]I offered to help her, but she took off.
[259:25.06]Nice flex.
[259:25.42]Can't really blame her for running from a guy with your looks.
[259:28.26]Must be from that bus full of children that I saved, you know.
[259:33.14]Anyway, she was saying something about Santa Cabeza.
[259:37.77]Santa Cabeza, I think I... Somebody turning?
[259:45.57]Dr. Burnaby, you're awake.
[259:48.95]Santa Cabeza.
[259:52.47]I should have known.
[259:56.99]I thought Santa Cabeza was over and done with.
[260:02.10]You plan to dispense justice now?
[260:04.56]Calm down, Dr. Barnaby.
[260:06.84]We're only following orders.
[260:09.31]We have to protect you.
[260:10.59]Protect?
[260:12.07]More like imprison.
[260:14.91]Professor, if we're going to protect you, we need to know the truth.
[260:17.95]I know who this is.
[260:18.89]All of it.
[260:20.57]Please.
[260:22.02]Who is this?
[260:22.56]Talk to us.
[260:28.26]Huh?
[260:30.26]I take it you know what Santa Cabeza is.
[260:32.96]Am I right?
[260:33.42]Alright, I have to get out of this WWE 2K20 created character clothing in here.
[260:47.21]I'll just get my information somewhere else, thank you very much.
[260:53.55]Maybe if I can track down that woman again...
[261:02.86]Alright, I'm just going to go.
[261:04.52]Case number three coming up.
[261:07.00]From 11 a.m.
[261:08.48]The next case will occur at 3 p.m.
[261:10.43]Oh, so I got some free roam time.
[261:11.63]I actually really do.
[261:16.81]Alright, I got some time.
[261:18.93]Is there anything else I can do?
[261:20.11]The hatchet man and the coward.
[261:22.94]Coward.
[261:28.78]Save it.
[261:38.55]Lovers A and B, I'm not going to get there fast enough.
[261:55.70]I'm the coward.
[261:57.58]Well, I'm not going to get there fast enough.
[262:04.46]It's not all about doing the missions.
[262:07.40]You know, it's about, I need, I want to go and get some cool weapons and I want to change my clothes.
[262:17.08]I want to press, just press the button.
[262:26.38]So I can throw further now, if that's the last thing I'm leveled up with.
[262:38.90]Okay.
[262:41.34]Sure did.
[262:42.05]Let's test it.
[262:46.87]Nice.
[262:54.83]Okay, let's get some clothes.
[262:55.93]This is a reading store.
[263:01.70]Let's recharge the battery.
[263:10.94]I need a new weapon, but I don't have anything.
[263:14.88]Oh, wait.
[263:16.18]Toy store.
[263:16.76]Fine.
[263:17.04]I'll put on, like, the joke outfit.
[263:20.36]Okay.
[263:23.26]Fine.
[263:24.36]Frisbee?
[263:26.58]That's actually pretty fun.
[263:30.54]Check this out.
[263:30.96]Ready?
[263:32.78]Oops.
[263:33.32]Wrong button.
[263:36.57]Change clothes.
[263:37.23]Alright, I'll give you the Roblox guy.
[263:48.68]What else can I do?
[263:51.24]Oh, super soaker.
[263:54.33]Nice.
[263:58.05]Now this, I remember this.
[263:59.33]This is what I remember.
[264:00.03]I remember, hey, dude, I gotta go to the bathroom.
[264:04.79]Like, you wanna play for a minute?
[264:06.43]Yeah, sure, man.
[264:08.27]And I did this for about 45 seconds.
[264:11.44]This is kind of a fun game.
[264:13.12]Yeah, yeah, man.
[264:14.32]Ready to go?
[264:14.94]Yeah.
[264:15.76]I'm ready to go.
[264:29.39]I'm not making, this is not a joke.
[264:30.81]This actually happened with my time in Dead Rising 1.
[264:33.01]Alright, what do I put over here?
[264:38.54]Kid's clothing.
[264:50.47]Can I pick the color of shirt?
[264:52.83]No.
[264:59.86]No, I want a different outfit.
[265:00.96]I don't want just, like, the kids' clothes.
[265:04.64]I was already in this.
[265:07.38]There's no other style.
[265:08.50]It's only this.
[265:11.28]I have to be in, like, the man-child outfit.
[265:20.96]Bowling ball.
[265:21.48]Nice.
[265:25.14]It's perfect for you.
[265:26.10]What about the... Oh, wait!
[265:28.06]Hold on.
[265:29.66]Oh no, I'm gonna Lefferdab myself.
[265:31.56]Hey, this is even worse.
[265:38.59]What about this?
[265:41.59]What's in here?
[265:42.07]There's two sides.
[265:46.34]Is it the same thing?
[265:47.04]The fuck just happened?
[265:58.81]Alright, is there a horse body that I can use?
[266:00.87]Is it like a furry outfit?
[266:08.48]Is it like a furry suit?
[266:10.46]Alright, let's do the coward.
[266:14.72]What have we got?
[266:18.55]Weekly photo magazine.
[266:19.75]What's this do?
[266:21.11]Get a visual cue to indicate prime photo timing.
[266:23.53]That's kind of cool.
[266:24.09]I'll use it for a while.
[266:26.65]I lost a scoop.
[266:28.97]Sports.
[266:31.19]Hold on to sporting goods three times as long as usual.
[266:33.77]I'll use it for now.
[266:40.66]Hey Frankie, did you get your homework done?
[266:42.70]What?
[266:50.23]Oh, what's up?
[266:51.07]It's you again.
[266:52.75]I get it, we're all nervous when we're beginners.
[266:56.83]Okay.
[266:57.27]Let me take a look.
[266:58.13]Show me your best shot.
[266:59.05]Uh-oh.
[267:02.13]Am I gonna get judged?
[267:04.79]Get your best erotica photo ready.
[267:10.43]I don't have any.
[267:19.13]This is just somebody sitting down.
[267:20.81]This one?
[267:36.50]What?
[267:38.04]Did I just complete the mission?
[267:39.20]It's like an old medieval helmet.
[267:44.21]At noon tomorrow.
[268:06.13]Cool.
[268:07.75]Alright.
[268:08.89]So, uh, I have some of these.
[268:10.51]Okay, wait, we're gonna go to the smoothie shop.
[268:13.29]Pie.
[268:13.61]Can I, is there a blender back here?
[268:14.53]Can I make a pie smoothie?
[268:17.69]That'd probably help.
[268:19.31]Pamela!
[268:21.19]Wait, you'll be fine.
[268:24.24]Pamela!
[268:25.28]Pamela, do you want a pie smoothie?
[268:28.38]I'm making two.

[270:31.39]Okay, why can I not just de-select?
[270:33.96]Okay, if I have the book in my hand, why can I just select no unarmed?
[270:37.56]I want to keep the book, but I don't want to have it in my hand and read it.
[270:40.90]Why can I not have unarmed?
[270:42.30]Follow me.

[282:18.15]Got the whole bowl of their hands.
[282:19.21]I'm running out of time for the coward man.
[282:22.53]What are you doing?
[282:23.14]Here.
[282:24.16]Come here.
[282:31.82]Why did you let go?
[282:32.44]Good.
[282:47.25]Hold on a minute, I got this.
[282:49.49]No shit, I'm trying to swing it.

[283:36.52]Don't cry.
[283:36.96]Come on.
[283:39.30]Hey, mama.
[283:40.90]I'm like yelling like I'm their mother.
[283:45.51]Am I going the right way?
[283:54.04]I passed it.
[283:54.76]It's behind us.
[283:59.21]Taunt.
[284:06.29]Where you going?
[284:08.98]What was there?
[284:25.40]Alright, we're safe.
[284:25.90]I might have to do Restaurant Man, though.
[284:30.27]Come on!
[284:34.55]Follow me!
[284:41.58]Pamela.
[284:43.28]Come on!
[284:46.10]I know you can do it.
[284:47.06]There's no zombies.
[284:48.66]I'll take care of everything.
[284:49.44]Just follow behind me.
[284:52.30]Let's go.
[284:52.64]Follow me!
[285:02.26]I'm ready.
[285:04.54]In?
[285:06.48]Come on!
[285:10.89]Come on!
[285:16.21]Bingo.
[285:21.02]Follow me!
[285:23.36]Demo?
[285:30.22]Follow me!
[285:38.85]Heather Tompkins!
[285:40.07]This place sucks.
[285:40.85]It's dirty.
[285:41.35]It's cramped.
[285:41.81]Isn't there a shower around here?
[285:43.01]Alright.
[285:49.90]60,000 P. That's a lot of P. Speed up.
[285:53.26]Good.
[285:55.78]Speed increased.
[285:56.66]Alright, I need to look at the move list.
[285:58.90]Do I have enough time to do Coward?
[285:59.88]Okay, what about Status?
[286:06.68]Ta- Speed.
[286:07.46]Okay.
[286:07.80]Skills.
[286:10.73]Jump kick.
[286:11.13]I know that.
[286:11.50]It's zombie red.
[286:12.36]This skill allows you to climb on unsuspecting zombies.
[286:14.32]You can even walk along the top of zombie crowds.
[286:16.62]Press A while pushing left stick towards nearby standing zombies.
[286:20.72]I've done that.
[286:22.16]Kick back.
[286:24.46]When grabbed by a zombie, repeatedly push left stick in the direction Frank is facing to deliver a kick to the attacker.
[286:30.39]Repeatedly.
[286:30.89]Does that mean go... Or does that mean just hold it?
[286:36.59]Flying dodge.
[286:39.33]Push left stick in the same direction twice in rapid succession to throw yourself in that direction.
[286:43.72]So it's a dodge.
[286:45.76]You are invincible at the beginning of this move, but the end will leave you open for a moment.
[286:49.12]Okay.
[286:50.84]Avoid zombie attacks with this skill when grabby zombie repeatedly push left stick to the right or left to repel the attack and escape danger.
[286:58.43]Okay.
[287:02.53]Cool.
[287:03.85]Save the game.
[287:08.35]Save it.
[287:08.82]Hurry.
[287:11.44]What am I holding?
[287:12.08]This is a really strange thing for me to say, but that's inside computer shipping foam.
[287:20.91]That's exactly what that looks like.
[287:24.18]Alright, sleep.
[287:26.06]Whew.
[287:37.43]If you buy a computer and you have it shipped to you, or if you make a computer for somebody and you send it to somebody to protect the components inside, you put this weird foam shit that you put in it, like... It grows and it conforms to all the components.
[287:50.20]It's really actually kind of an interesting thing.
[287:51.76]Alright, I'm going for the coward.
[288:11.50]You are fucking demented.
[288:19.06]Um, no.
[288:19.82]People know what I'm talking about.
[288:24.92]I think I probably could do Restaurant Man too.
[288:33.37]I just realized what character I am.
[288:37.85]I'm Rorschach from Watchmen.
[288:43.08]I'm going to keep this on.
[288:49.56]Behold!
[288:50.68]Uh-oh.
[288:51.86]The end of the world is upon us.
[288:55.67]Death itself has overflowed upon the world.
[289:01.09]Through the green mass.
[289:02.05]Defying us all.
[289:10.05]Rorschach's log.
[289:12.44]December 25th.
[289:14.20]The stench of blood and foul things plague my nostrils.
[289:30.13]Hey!
[289:31.01]That was rough.
[289:44.62]A camera!
[289:44.98]Oh no, he's gonna put this on the internet!
[289:46.78]A non-believer in our midst.
[290:17.45]If we are to achieve salvation... His blood must flow!
[290:25.23]He must be purged!
[290:28.55]Yeah, why would you be filming that?
[290:30.36]Why wouldn't you stop that?
[290:31.32]The blood of the heretic!
[290:47.97]Let's go!
[290:52.33]Hey!
[290:52.45]Holy shit, he just charges forward.
[290:55.91]Are you guys a coward?
[290:57.84]How about this one?
[290:58.74]You don't have a cow, man.
[291:13.26]That's not a Bart Simpson.
[291:14.88]What's wrong with me?
[291:15.62]Get off me!
[291:21.00]Did I just end up in a box?
[291:22.94]Wait.
[291:30.41]It's scripted.
[291:35.85]Some kind of old-fashioned lock device.
[291:41.66]I need to enter a passcode.
[291:50.94]You're dead.
[291:51.72]That's it.
[291:52.30]Nice try.
[292:02.31]They all keep doing the same move.
[292:06.31]I gotta get it.
[292:06.81]I gotta get it on camera.
[292:07.69]I've gotta get it on camera.
[292:09.07]The three of them.
[292:13.53]The charge.
[292:13.95]Come on.
[292:29.40]There's some Resident Evil shit here.
[292:32.24]Resident Evil 4, it's the same dialogue, man.
[292:37.92]Good.
[292:38.88]Holy fuck, he's running fast!
[292:40.00]You're not gonna put me back in the box, are you?
[292:47.31]How am I gonna get through this?
[293:04.92]I thought I jumped over it.
[293:10.46]Give me a knife.
[293:14.90]Where's a knife?
[293:15.28]Give me a knife.
[293:16.82]Uh-oh.
[293:17.36]Anyone there?
[293:39.59]Crunching on their Doritos is what gets their attention.
[293:42.43]That's a lot of PT, right?
[293:46.11]Fuck, that's so many people.
[294:17.86]That's it.
[294:19.30]None of these guys are dropping knives?
[294:27.41]This is bad.
[294:29.45]I'm running out of time.
[294:40.77]Good.
[294:41.03]Snap ladder.
[294:41.41]I thought I died.
[294:46.29]Oh, fuck.
[294:47.39]Oh, fuck!
[295:10.83]Oh, fuck!
[295:13.76]Oh, what do I... How do I get out of here?
[295:19.40]What is this?
[295:19.78]No, no, no.
[295:24.58]I need a better picture of that.
[295:25.64]Better picture than that.
[295:31.12]Get fucking stuffed.
[295:41.96]Cargo box.
[295:42.64]I just, like, paper cut that guy's face in half.
[295:51.32]You get the passcode.
[295:52.02]Alright.
[295:54.39]Uh, get rid of this.
[295:54.95]Did I already get it?
[296:01.89]Did I already get it?
[296:09.46]I got it.
[296:13.70]Okay.
[296:15.54]Jennifer, are you alright?
[296:16.26]Why am I out here?
[296:41.27]Where's all my stuff?
[296:42.63]It's gone.
[296:43.63]Wait a minute.
[296:46.17]Jill's sandwiches.
[296:49.21]I'm not going to be able to do either one of these.
[296:51.57]I didn't know where I am.
[296:53.69]Where's the car?
[297:00.34]I'm not going to be able to do the car.
[297:01.70]I have to go back.
[297:13.97]I'm starving to death here.
[297:15.37]What?
[297:16.57]Ronald?
[297:19.74]Ronald?
[297:24.04]Hey, you got some food, right?
[297:25.16]Split it with me.
[297:25.70]I'm dying here.
[297:26.38]Uh...
[297:35.37]That's a pretty good shot.
[297:36.23]I don't have any food.
[297:36.89]I have to bring you food?
[297:38.83]Here, have some ketchup.
[297:41.87]Sorry, pal.
[297:42.29]Fresh out.
[297:44.41]Trying to bull guard it all for yourself, huh?
[297:46.41]You're just gonna eat every last morsel?
[297:48.67]Okay, well I need to bring food then.
[297:58.83]There's nothing in this whole restaurant?
[298:03.22]Well, okay, I found restaurant man.
[298:14.74]What the?
[298:17.50]Huh?
[298:18.78]Ronald!
[298:20.06]Now would be a good time.
[298:29.15]Oh, this sucks.
[298:30.33]Um, I have to go back.
[298:32.93]Craft something?
[298:33.63]What do you mean craft something?
[298:44.03]You craft something?
[298:54.95]Heat up a pan on the stove.

[327:13.57]I just like almost spit.
[327:19.86]When they fall they land.
[327:20.84]I'm going to have to take a picture of this.
[327:29.31]This is going to break too.

[333:20.51]Sally, good work.
[333:23.23]Stay right there.
[333:28.39]Sally, don't move.
[333:38.96]No matter what you do, do not move at all.
[333:41.00]Stay right there.
[333:45.80]What is it, Audrey?
[333:47.30]I spotted a guy in the cosmetic shop in the entrance closet.
[333:50.62]I think he looks a little odd.
[333:52.00]Just check it out.
[333:52.80]I don't have any more weapons.
[334:11.52]This might compromise Sally.
[334:14.72]This is going to compromise Sally, I think.
[334:23.83]Gun
[335:07.62]I needed more guns.
[335:08.80]I needed more weapons.
[335:10.38]I had an interesting opportunity.
[335:16.99]Okay.
[335:17.31]I have to save Nick again?
[335:21.73]I just thought that was another person and it was me and it freaked me the fuck out.
[335:25.55]Okay.
[335:26.73]Uh, above the law.
[335:31.27]I need guns.
[335:33.40]In fact, I've got a better idea.
[335:36.30]I'm getting only chainsaws.
[335:37.93]Oh, I can't do that.
[335:39.81]Never mind.
[335:42.25]I'm just going up there with a chainsaw.
[335:50.10]I just need a couple of distractions.
[335:52.78]I'm not going to use the chainsaw until I get there.
[335:57.18]I'm ready.
[335:58.02]Let's go.
[336:05.95]Get rid of the dumbbell.
[336:24.34]That was a pretty good throw, it was.
[336:25.40]Okay, I also am going to pick up the other chainsaw and I'm not going to use it for down here.
[336:31.19]I'm going to kill a few people and then I'm going to get a bug.
[336:37.14]Understand?
[336:38.66]Do we understand?
[336:39.24]Mini chainsaw.
[336:42.54]I'll come back.
[336:46.30]In fact, I could probably use this.
[336:47.52]Let's put this in a place where I know it's going to be.
[336:50.54]You know what?
[336:51.18]Fuck it.
[336:51.74]Let's go.
[337:08.64]Good.
[337:10.18]Okay.
[337:10.84]Here we go.
[337:13.82]Get that chainsaw.
[337:16.42]Excellent.
[337:17.10]Don't use it.
[337:18.64]Back over here.
[337:21.79]Okay.
[337:25.33]Here we go.
[337:27.33]I'm going to just... I'm going to get a queen.
[337:34.33]Somebody's gonna have a queen in here.
[337:43.49]Where's the queen?
[337:44.03]Somebody... Who's got red eyes?
[337:46.69]Which one of you has red eyes?
[337:48.57]Show yourself, please.
[337:50.01]I appreciate it.
[337:51.95]Picture?
[337:52.35]Forgot about that.
[337:53.59]Let's get them both with a picture, what do you say?
[338:00.85]5,000 points.
[338:04.04]Pretty good.
[338:04.62]Alright, we need Queen.
[338:13.17]Queen!
[338:15.59]Swing!
[338:16.41]What are you doing?
[338:17.61]You really just let that happen.
[338:35.07]No Queens yet?
[338:38.15]Give me a fucking break.
[338:39.65]If I die right now, I will be so upset about this.
[338:48.04]I don't want to use the chainsaw.
[338:49.26]Didn't the queen drop by this point?
[338:58.08]Oh man, this is bad.
[339:13.12]I don't need to kill every zombie?
[339:14.10]No, I just need to kill one queen.
[339:28.47]Just farm chainsaws.
[339:30.42]That's kind of cheating though, isn't it?
[339:40.34]Who cares?
[339:40.96]It's a gray area.
[339:42.60]Is that a queen?
[339:45.06]I think I got one.
[339:46.54]That'll be huge if it is.
[339:51.08]You know what?
[339:51.96]I'm just gonna use it a little bit.
[339:59.32]That's not a queen.
[340:05.77]Imagine not cheesing, and Dead Rising.

[350:37.13]One.
[350:38.65]You're the only fucking reliable one, okay?
[350:41.19]Only reliable person.
[350:42.59]You motherfucker.
[351:00.05]Get out of the way!
[351:01.29]Sally's in trouble!

[351:18.65]Get in the bathroom!
[351:20.95]In!
[351:21.29]Oh!
[351:37.16]Just press it.
[351:37.72]They're not going to all make it.
[351:39.06]Don't they all have to be in here?
[351:40.08]They all have to be in here, don't they?
[351:42.79]Is that going to work?
[351:52.17]None of them made it in.
[351:53.53]I just want to make that real clear.
[351:55.06]All you jokers in here, only one person made it in.
[352:06.85]He's blocking the way.
[352:08.72]He's blocking the path.
[352:09.80]That's the problem.
[352:12.90]What are you thinking?
[352:13.66]Nick Evans defected.
[352:29.13]I'm going to fucking throw up.
[352:38.14]He has the chainsaw!
[352:41.90]Hello!
[352:46.34]I spotted somebody in the cosmetic shop!
[352:50.38]Holy shit, that was awesome!
[352:52.03]What are we supposed to do?
[353:05.34]Did she just shoot herself in the head?
[353:08.74]What happened?
[353:23.29]I just heard like a gunfire and then a flat landing person.
[353:29.55]So...
[353:34.45]Set the marker in the bathroom.
[353:36.55]Get in here.
[353:37.41]Oh, now they all... Now they all caught Brandon.
[353:40.87]You all get it now?
[353:41.95]Interesting.
[353:42.59]I didn't do anything.
[353:43.19]They all just... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[353:43.96]Follow me.
[353:44.64]Okay, we all good?
[353:47.58]1, 2, 3... It's like WoW nameplates.
[353:50.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[353:51.54]We're good.
[353:52.60]Save it right here.
[354:05.44]Give me that fucking weapon.
[354:09.08]I can't get it from him.
[354:12.36]Okay, now from here... It's as easy as coming out this door, taking a left, and going in the elevator.
[354:21.80]Set a waypoint.
[354:30.19]Go!
[354:40.32]Okay.
[354:41.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[354:42.60]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

[354:49.43]This is so bad.
[354:50.33]I need a weapon.
[354:51.01]I'm going to teleport you.
[354:51.67]Hold on.
[354:52.49]Wait.
[354:52.67]What is that on the ground?
[354:53.25]I'm going to die over here now.
[354:59.39]What happened?
[354:59.73]Trade.
[355:04.50]I don't even care.
[355:05.12]Just take this.
[355:05.72]I don't even care if you heal.
[355:10.62]Can I give this to you?
[355:12.16]Take this, please.
[355:13.22]I need to use- I need that weapon.
[355:18.02]This is a fucking mess.
[355:20.00]This is a mess.
[355:25.25]I just took the zombie bait.
[355:26.77]Oh, that's bad.
[355:28.85]Wait, everybody stay back!
[355:31.13]Go that way!
[355:33.19]I'll be back in a minute.

[355:59.02]God damn it, okay.
[356:00.56]Now I gotta get out of here.
[356:04.74]How did the glass not break?
[356:10.22]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[356:11.78]Don't keep... Move out of my way.
[356:21.45]Okay, everybody.
[356:22.55]Which way do we go?
[356:23.37]This way?
[356:23.95]Make sure I'm facing the right direction.
[356:26.30]Straight ahead.

[364:41.78]I need you all to just stand literally right there.
[364:46.54]Okay?
[364:47.20]Good.
[364:47.36]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[365:05.91]I'm gonna get, like, fucking 500 million points for this.
[365:08.29]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[365:19.67]Come on!
[365:27.02]You can do it.
[365:27.52]Up this way.
[365:29.14]Nick, you take, uh, you take up, like, the whole thing.
[365:31.06]Just, somebody please go.
[365:33.40]You just have to be in this right area.

[366:13.10]I still have like three times.
[366:14.46]240,000 people.
[366:15.24]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[366:24.54]Time.
[366:26.12]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[366:28.38]Oh, no.
[366:38.12]Oh, no.
[366:39.92]Where is this?
[366:42.14]I don't have time.
[366:42.82]I have to go.
[366:43.22]I have no time.
[366:44.24]I have to save it, but I have no time to save.
[366:51.56]What are we doing here?
[367:08.75]Let's go.
[367:33.03]Alright, help me out here guys.
[367:35.17]Help me out here.
[367:35.59]Is there a shortcut?
[367:36.80]Should I take a shortcut?
[367:37.58]Help me out here.
[367:39.30]Or do I have to run?
[367:47.82]I have to just run.
[367:48.76]Just run.
[367:49.36]Just run.
[367:52.98]Grab a skateboard.
[367:53.80]Nice.
[367:55.14]Get off the...
[367:57.99]Otis, I swear to god, you've come in at the wrong fucking times.
[368:01.41]I got- I can't- I gotta go, I gotta go.
[368:10.80]No, I don't.
[368:22.78]Movie land?
[368:26.55]How did I do three golf clubs?
[368:27.69]That was so stupid.
[368:31.95]Oh, please don't kill me here.
[368:38.74]Alright, Otis, you can talk to me now.
[368:42.08]Old Man and the Antique Chop.
[368:43.30]He seems weird.
[368:45.30]He's calm.
[368:45.98]He's not mad at me right now.
[368:54.41]There's more.
[368:54.91]I spotted a guy at the cosmetic shop at the entrance plaza.
[368:57.53]That's fine.
[368:57.99]I'm not gonna do that.
[368:58.77]There's a sniper over there, probably.
[369:05.53]Yeah, all this stuff.
[369:09.08]I was too busy saving six people.
[369:15.20]Okay.
[369:18.02]Okay.
[369:26.10]Give me this.
[369:26.42]Give me this.
[369:27.77]Get out of the way, bitch!
[369:28.61]That was rude.
[369:37.62]But, circumstance.
[369:44.22]It's not this way.
[369:45.04]It's not this way.
[369:46.26]Turn.
[369:49.25]Don't blow that up.
[369:56.50]I'll get there.
[369:59.10]Big bits for rude streamer.
[370:02.72]Uh, thank you KnitCat for the 5,000 bits.
[370:07.57]Appreciate it.
[370:08.05]Thank you.
[370:08.35]I can't believe you got all six.
[370:12.01]Thanks for the laughs.
[370:12.65]Trying to round them all up.
[370:13.55]Loving the stream.
[370:14.09]Keep it up, gamer.
[370:17.55]Am I going to try to chase this person with a shopping cart?
[370:20.50]I have to beat her before I run out of time.
[370:31.08]Oh, this is not good.
[370:32.14]This is bad.
[370:42.25]Oh, no.
[370:43.43]No.
[370:44.55]Alright, let's go.
[370:53.80]Did she just crash?
[370:56.48]I'm dead.
[371:09.56]I didn't get a single hit.
[371:13.61]Well, at least I know I can get over there.
[371:14.73]I can go to the gun store?
[371:22.88]Yeah, I'm gonna go to the gun store.
[371:24.70]That's not a bad idea.
[371:36.66]alright let's pull it up uh there's probably a better save point I can do besides this just go get the op chainsaw let me see if I can do it without it that's I don't want to use that as a crutch I have plenty of time to get down here the gun store is near the boss anyways okay
[372:05.12]Plus there's a shopping cart there, so I can get there quickly.
[372:11.14]I'm just gonna get down there.
[372:12.50]I'm gonna save the game in a bathroom that's over there.
[372:15.86]I'm gonna use the knife.
[372:26.79]Not bad.
[372:28.75]Wrong way.
[372:29.33]I don't really care about Otis.
[372:32.58]He's gonna say the same shit that he said many times already.
[372:36.26]Find the person?
[372:36.94]Nah, I don't have time for that.
[372:38.00]I just took too long.
[372:38.90]Okay.
[372:40.97]Put some shoes on, you freak.
[372:42.63]Oh, better traction.
[372:58.42]Alright.
[372:59.56]Not a big deal.
[373:05.67]Hug this wall, and then when I get in here, I gotta find a save point.
[373:08.80]So I can go right through here.
[373:34.57]investigate alright let me take a look so in here we've got home and garden movie land we've got wait a minute this is here hunting shack
[373:59.20]So if I bang a left... Is there no save point?
[374:02.28]Okay, there is a save point, but I don't... Okay, so if I go down here, through the plaza, and then bang a right in here, there's a firearm shack.
[374:09.63]Okay, you got it.
[374:26.10]I have time for this bullshit.
[374:34.95]I don't have time for this shit.
[374:39.57]Okay, let's go.
[374:42.11]And there's a save point right down there too.
[374:43.57]For the boss.
[374:46.39]I can't take a call when I'm driving.
[374:49.89]That's not safe.
[374:51.62]Alright, now wait!
[375:01.00]It's behind me and in the little corner over here.
[375:07.22]This way?
[375:08.42]There it is.
[375:14.68]All the way down?
[375:15.18]Okay, leave that.
[375:19.37]Why is this like a cutscene?
[375:24.61]Who's this?
[375:25.09]Look, mister, if we're gonna fight these zombies, we need guns!
[375:28.13]Goddammit!
[375:30.75]I trust the MDM zombies about as far as I can throw them, but I trust people even less!
[375:36.13]don't shoot look let's talk this over talk to my 12 gauge don't get no closer I'll blow y'all the kingdom come hey hang on I don't know who this is okay but they're dead it was just a random person now they're dead damn it I warned you this is a boss fight in a situation like this I can't afford to trust nobody
[376:12.91]I didn't even, I missed completely.
[376:24.08]Um, okay.
[376:25.54]So, there's, um... Is this, is this blocking?
[376:29.91]I don't have any guns.
[376:32.85]He's loading, he's loading!
[376:36.19]He's drinking!
[376:36.71]He's drinking!
[376:37.13]He's drinking!
[376:37.81]He's drinking!
[376:38.67]I'm dead.
[376:39.27]I'm gonna die.
[376:40.11]I'm dead.
[376:40.41]How many times have I been like, I'm dead.
[376:41.71]I'm dead.
[376:42.17]I'm dead.
[376:42.91]I'm dead.
[376:44.23]Oh, that's it.
[376:44.71]I'm dead.
[376:56.38]That was bullshit.
[377:06.38]That was actual bullshit.
[377:10.88]Oh well.
[377:30.38]Fuck.
[377:34.05]Damn it.
[377:39.21]Go load up on baseball bats?
[377:41.97]No, I think I could kill her.
[377:45.19]It's gonna take a little bit of, uh... crutch bullshit, but... I can do it.
[378:05.51]I also need to save some for tomorrow, too.
[378:09.70]You know, whatever.
[378:10.28]It's been six hours.
[378:12.19]Yeah, I don't... I want to save it for tomorrow.
[378:23.37]This game's long?
[378:25.43]Yeah, I'm having fun.
[378:27.73]Hold on, let me just do this first.
[378:31.18]You're only halfway through?
[378:32.16]That's what I mean.
[378:34.60]Because I'm streaming this tomorrow.
[378:36.68]So I'd like to have another full stream tomorrow, too.
[378:52.25]Alright.
[378:56.24]This way, and then... Let me look at this.
[379:04.56]Once I get over here, I'm not gonna... How do you even get down that far?
[379:10.15]It's like another six hours?
[379:11.71]Yeah, that's perfect.
[379:15.11]I'll, you know, I'll give this one more attempt.
[379:17.21]And then we'll call it.
[379:19.05]If I do it, I do it.
[379:19.83]And if I don't, I don't.
[379:20.93]We'll do it again, we'll do it twice.
[379:23.50]Because that would be a good six to seven hours, then six to seven hours more.
[379:27.64]I think that lines up pretty perfectly.
[379:37.66]Don't run straight into nothing.
[379:44.53]The golf clubs really are awful.
[379:47.31]Am I going to do Death Stranding?
[379:49.49]I don't think so.
[379:53.31]I don't.
[379:53.73]And not because I don't think the game is going to be any good, but because I think it's going to be long and a lot of story, which is good, but I'm not sure that's something I want to stream.
[380:15.05]No, why would you do that?
[380:19.97]I have plenty of time.
[380:20.67]I don't have to freak out.
[380:25.17]And now I'm going to try to save it over here.
[380:29.55]I'm sure it's going to be interesting.
[380:30.64]Alright, I don't want to go all the way.
[380:36.74]Where's the save point?
[380:40.38]Do I have to go all the way?
[380:41.50]Maybe I don't have to.
[380:42.24]I'm going to save this in a different slot.
[380:51.01]Can I bang a right?
[380:57.98]Where the hell is this?
[381:00.00]Right next to me?
[381:02.60]Alright, easy.
[381:18.25]Different slot, just in case something horrible happens.
[381:22.63]Okay.
[381:23.87]So regardless, I have a way... I'm gonna beat it tomorrow.
[381:27.09]Because I'm stuck here.
[381:29.09]It's either this or nothing.
[381:30.51]I have to do it.
[381:31.07]You were just off-camera.
[381:38.38]That was bullshit.
[381:40.46]Let's see if I can kill him.
[381:49.48]There we go.
[381:59.16]Get that gun, too.
[382:07.24]Any weapons up here?
[382:09.16]What's that?
[382:10.74]A nail gun.
[382:12.83]I fell off.
[382:13.85]Go back up.
[382:15.01]I don't have any heals, either.
[382:17.15]Alright, where's she going?
[382:25.19]No, I didn't get it.
[382:37.21]There's no time for this, just kill her.
[382:39.13]Where are you going?
[382:43.23]What?
[382:45.76]Wait, what?
[382:46.36]Is she coming back?
[382:50.10]I see a headlight.
[382:55.44]What the fuck just happened?
[382:57.96]She's not gonna- You gotta be kidding me.
[383:03.21]All the way up!
[383:05.21]Am I safe?
[383:05.95]I'm safe in here.
[383:10.99]She's a fucking maniac.
[383:17.08]Have you ever rode on a motorcycle before?
[383:19.18]I'm almost out of time.
[383:27.50]She just drove away again.
[383:35.46]I'm gonna try to crash into her.
[384:00.35]This is fucking outrageous.
[384:04.97]I mean, she turns so fast, like on a dime.
[384:07.95]What if I stand in the corner?
[384:09.87]She can't get me with her.
[384:15.36]I lost... Okay.
[384:22.05]So... I gotta kill her quick.
[384:29.28]I'll give it one more time.
[384:30.10]One more time.
[384:33.44]Maybe just hit her in the head with a board.
[384:35.04]I don't know.
[384:35.54]I wonder... How do I get... Can I get
[384:44.91]There's a sword shop next to her?
[384:49.41]The shopping cart's not doing anything for me right now.
[384:53.59]Wait, is there?
[384:54.05]What is it?
[384:55.29]Sean's Food, CD Crazy, and then Ripper's Blade is just straight ahead.
[385:01.61]Try the bomb cart?
[385:04.54]Oh, now I have to make it explode, don't I?
[385:08.66]Thanks a lot, asshole.
[385:15.40]I don't have any time to do this.
[385:17.04]This is precious seconds I'm wasting.
[385:19.26]Please, for the love of all that is fucking sacred, get away from me.
[385:23.52]Okay.
[385:26.04]Let's try it.
[385:27.30]Can I just put it down in front of her?
[385:39.41]Oh.
[385:42.19]It's gone.
[385:42.53]It disappeared.
[385:46.98]They don't really give you even one tenth of a second, do they?
[385:53.96]I just want to see what's even in the fucking room!
[386:08.17]What the hell is this encounter?
[386:12.58]It's because I'm not wearing shoes?
[386:14.92]That's not real.
[386:24.51]What do I mean by yes?
[386:28.06]I have a handicap.
[386:29.62]Because I don't have shoes on.
[386:32.50]Don't tell me that's real.
[386:33.58]Is that real?
[386:35.46]That can't be real.
[386:36.56]Alright, she's not gonna come in here.
[386:42.14]And if she does, then she's in trouble.
[386:48.38]Okay, what do we got?
[386:55.62]I can't even open the goddamn case.
[386:57.48]Thanks for opening the case.
[387:02.92]Why are you even in here?
[387:04.46]Oh my god, I want to fucking bury you.
[387:07.96]Katana.
[387:09.02]Alright, all it takes is one good katana swing.
[387:15.25]This is like the sloppiest fight ever.
[387:34.40]I feel like I'm playing GTA right now.
[387:48.43]Jesus!
[387:55.31]She's stuck!
[387:55.67]No, she's not.
[387:56.97]I'm gonna lose.
[388:02.24]She's moving around like a mouse.
[388:08.36]Okay, got it.
[388:09.12]Got one hit on her.
[388:17.52]I have an idea.
[388:20.05]I'm going to try to bait her into the shop.
[388:21.75]And have her stuff in the shop.
[388:23.83]And get stuck in there.
[388:24.65]Let's see if it works.
[388:33.12]Get out of the way.
[388:37.79]You.
[388:37.93]Give me a gun.
[388:38.89]No gun?
[388:39.19]Didn't have a gun.
[388:42.85]Any more police?
[388:45.62]Nope.
[388:48.34]Here we go.
[388:57.84]She's in.
[388:58.74]She's in.
[389:00.10]Come on.
[389:01.76]Come on.
[389:01.92]Get in.
[389:03.45]She was in.
[389:04.33]God damn it, she was in.
[389:05.23]I had her in.
[389:18.94]This is the most absurd thing I've ever seen.
[389:20.74]Let's go.
[389:30.14]Now you're gonna use your gun.
[389:31.46]Let's get in, get in, in, in, in!
[389:36.84]Is she in?
[389:42.17]Fuck!
[389:46.01]Wasn't the be- I'll take the sword.
[389:48.01]Mm-hmm.
[389:50.55]Alright.
[389:51.33]Time to slay the dragon.
[389:52.21]Can I, like, queue it up?
[390:10.05]That's the play.
[390:20.39]That's the play.
[390:28.04]That's the only way this is gonna work.
[390:29.08]I have to do that, like, ten times in a row.
[390:32.41]Well, she just gets... I don't even know what the actual strategy here is.
[390:37.62]What are you actually supposed to do here?
[390:42.00]What's, like, the real way to do this?
[390:43.32]You have to use a gun.
[390:46.70]Well, what if I don't have a gun?
[390:49.55]I need food and guns.
[390:55.21]Well, I don't have any time for that.
[390:56.07]I have to win.
[390:56.55]Is there any place over here?
[391:03.42]This food over here... I could get a bunch of food, but I'm not gonna do it in time.
[391:18.13]Guns.
[391:18.87]I need a gun.
[391:22.91]Police.
[391:23.79]Come here.
[391:25.17]You got a gun?
[391:25.77]Give that to me.
[391:28.05]Oh.
[391:28.49]Get the fuck out of here.
[391:29.51]Alright, hold on.
[391:30.79]Give me the O2 tank.
[391:35.35]You have a gun too?
[391:37.49]No.
[391:38.57]Alright, I have a gun.
[391:41.77]You have a gun too?
[391:42.25]No.
[391:44.56]Okay, where's that O2 tank?
[391:50.40]There it is.
[391:54.26]Don't shoot the O2 tank.
[391:55.58]Just give me the tank!
[392:20.22]It fucking despawns!
[392:22.52]Oh my god, that's so stupid!
[392:25.87]It's so- you have no time!
[392:28.67]I can't even go in the- Is there somebody else in here?
[392:34.94]What?
[393:04.25]Okay, so you can't go in there.
[393:07.17]I have to shoot it with that gun.
[393:08.89]I have to shoot at the propane tank.
[393:11.24]It has to be more perfect than landing a fucking triple axel in the Olympics.
[393:16.22]Where's the guy with the gun?
[393:19.96]Over here.
[393:31.46]stupid like NPC shitheads get away from me get out of here this is three oh I am so angry right now you have no idea this is a stupid ah
[393:57.35]GIVE ME THIS!
[394:06.03]My god damn it!
[394:14.78]And don't even- don't tell me it's because I don't have any shoes on!
[394:24.44]Nice climb, Frank.
[394:29.10]Where?
[394:29.42]Where are you?
[394:29.80]Where?
[394:30.16]Where?
[394:39.72]This is fucking unbelievable.
[394:42.75]How do you ever... Mouse and keyboard.
[394:46.07]How do I aim?
[394:46.89]How do I aim with mouse?
[394:49.55]What's like zoom in?
[394:50.43]What's aim on mouse?
[394:56.23]It's not right click?
[394:58.44]W?
[394:59.24]Q?
[395:02.12]Get back here.
[395:05.82]Why would Q be... I'm upset by that one.
[395:09.44]Where did she go?
[395:13.78]This game makes no sense.
[395:15.14]What the hell is going on right now?
[395:21.00]What is going on?
[395:42.21]This is fucking ridiculous.
[395:46.12]This is like I'm dead.
[395:47.32]Oh my god.
[395:50.44]Oh my god.
[396:00.25]Just throw katanas at her?
[396:02.77]Strategy number two incoming.
[396:14.09]It just happens every fucking time.
[396:16.01]Keep using the gun.
[396:17.79]I can't get a good shot.
[396:19.65]She rips around so much.
[396:21.43]Even when you shoot her, sometimes you hit her in the motorcycle.
[396:26.83]I'm just going in here.
[396:29.13]Go ahead, spin around.
[396:30.13]Nice turning.
[396:34.01]Great programming on the turning of the bike there.
[396:36.27]Who did that?
[396:38.99]It's bad.
[396:44.25]Give me the knives.
[396:48.99]Fuck outta here.
[396:50.40]Let's go.
[396:56.64]She's spinning in circles down here.
[397:09.56]Dude, no fucking way.
[397:22.73]It's possible, but can I even do this in time?
[397:44.90]How'd that miss?
[397:45.42]I don't even know how much time I actually have left.
[397:49.16]OK.
[398:01.08]OK.
[398:05.20]No, man.
[398:06.30]No, no.
[398:08.58]I have to.
[398:13.30]Swing when she gets close.
[398:14.24]It's easier said than done.
[398:17.89]Just jump kick her?
[398:19.87]Alright, honest to god.
[398:20.95]I'm going to break this thing in half.
[398:24.79]Why does this Xbox One controller suck such an asshole?
[398:27.18]I don't understand.
[398:31.50]She hasn't even run into me.
[398:42.52]It's already open.
[398:48.04]My god, this thing sucks.
[398:52.82]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[398:57.25]Like, what a piece of shi- what a piece of dog shit.
[399:01.85]Why is it disconnected?
[399:06.16]What?
[399:07.70]She was waiting for me to be plugged back in.
[399:09.29]At least I appreciate that.
[399:10.13]That's nice of you.
[399:26.05]Um.
[399:31.41]Hmm.
[399:31.73]I think I might just lose this one.
[399:35.69]Hey, wait a minute, that jump scare is out the window.
[399:37.89]Hi, guys.
[399:38.29]Yeah, we were just waiting for you.
[399:40.95]When you turn the corner, we just all bite you at the same time!
[399:50.20]That thing doesn't even do anything.
[399:53.82]And the guns?
[399:55.14]I feel like they do like a sliver of health.
[400:02.28]Throwing the katanas was doing more damage.
[400:10.45]He had a bigger gun.
[400:11.35]Well, look at the time.
[400:13.51]I might have to go back.
[400:18.52]To one of the other saves.
[400:24.34]It's actually fucking broken.
[400:28.10]I'm gonna mail this thing back to fucking Microsoft.
[400:42.44]This is so fucking broken.
[400:50.19]No, she was just... She was just stuck right here.
[401:01.74]This is un-fucking-believable.
[401:10.92]Oh, just shoot her.
[401:13.97]Just shoot her.
[401:21.20]I can't even do enough damage to her.
[401:40.09]Alright, is there like a chandelier that I can drop on her fucking head or something?
[401:44.00]Like, seriously.
[401:45.14]This seems so outrageously stupid.
[401:49.00]Even with a gun.
[401:55.63]This isn't Hitman.
[401:56.55]I just don't have enough time, so I just lose.
[402:08.82]I'm just gonna lose.
[402:11.48]Go get the gun from the fountain.
[402:16.31]I'd love to go- Alright, alright, alright, alright!
[402:19.67]I'm done.
[402:20.33]Game over.
[402:21.61]I'm done.
[402:22.33]I have to- I have to, like, fix this- I can't play with keyboard and mouse right now.
[402:25.81]I've been playing for, like, seven hours with controller.
[402:30.55]I have to figure out why this keeps disconnecting.
[402:41.61]We're gonna do it tomorrow.
[402:42.51]I'm gonna figure it out tomorrow.
[402:48.78]I'm gonna go to the fountain.
[402:49.78]You know, just kill me.
[402:50.64]Just kill me.
[403:02.17]Here she comes!
[403:03.57]Ooh, insult to injury.
[403:05.25]Ran over my head.
[403:09.01]You gotta get shoot.
[403:09.59]Alright, where was, I'm just curious.
[403:12.17]So this is, I have two saves here.
[403:15.79]Where is this one?
[403:20.00]It's all the way back, alright.
[403:21.24]Fountain, Uzi.
[403:33.71]I don't even know how to use the map.
[403:34.61]Is it M?
[403:35.05]Okay.
[403:36.13]Where's that fountain?
[403:37.73]God, I have no idea even how to control this fucking game with a keyboard.
[403:41.88]Um.
[403:43.54]What is going on?
[403:49.04]What?
[403:50.60]Alright.
[403:51.64]There's the food court.
[403:54.78]Where's the fountain?
[403:58.21]Not up here.
[404:00.01]This game sucks laughing my ass off.
[404:08.44]It doesn't though.
[404:09.44]It actually doesn't.
[404:10.54]Alright.
[404:13.42]So it's here.
[404:15.00]Can I get here and then up here?
[404:19.30]I'm going to have to just run over this way, grab a skateboard and skateboard all the way around.
[404:25.54]Is that going to work?
[404:41.00]I don't know.
[404:43.50]Into the food court.
[404:44.34]Grab some food.
[404:47.79]Hold on.
[404:48.09]Do I even have like another plug I can try?
[404:49.57]I'm so irritated by this.
[404:53.13]What a cheap piece of shit.
[404:54.73]Seriously.
[404:59.01]Yeah, like coffee pays like fucking 500 million of these things.
[405:02.14]And then dump them out for 80 bucks.
[405:04.42]Give me a break.
[405:15.32]Well, we'll go ahead and send that to our quality control department and maybe they'll figure it out.
[405:27.73]Oops.
[405:28.07]Alright, I'm done.
[405:36.23]Alright, that's it.
[405:36.87]That's it.
[405:37.19]I'm not going to start you around.
[405:38.23]I'm done.
[405:38.73]We'll come back tomorrow.
[405:41.34]Real anger time.
[405:43.73]Real anger hours.
[405:49.15]No, I'm having fun.
[405:50.19]It's just, what the fuck is going on here with this controller?
[405:52.59]Why are you doing this, man?
[405:55.37]Go on a rant?
[405:56.13]Alright, I'll tell you.
[405:57.82]Let me tell you something about fucking Xbox.
[406:01.70]Nah, we'll go tomorrow.
[406:03.44]We'll go tomorrow.
[406:03.90]Let me get like a new controller.
[406:06.70]Because here's what's going to happen.
[406:07.74]I'm telling you.
[406:09.17]I am going to get to where I was with the keyboard and mouse, and I'm not going to get the control right.
[406:14.28]And I'm going to, like, right-click when I should have hit Q, and it's going to be the make or break the rest of the stream, and I'm going to be very bad, and I'm going to go back, and I'm going to talk about Microsoft again.
[406:23.38]I'm going to go on a huge rant about how I should have had the controller, and if I had the controller, it's fucking stupid if I didn't.
[406:33.17]Nope.
[406:33.41]We'll start tomorrow.
[406:37.47]Just rebind to right-click.
[406:43.60]That's so close, too.
[406:44.98]Damn it.
[406:45.44]Whatever.
[406:46.08]It's all good.
[406:50.20]We want to rant.
[406:51.20]No, it's all good.
[406:51.74]It's all good.
[406:52.24]We're good.
[406:54.26]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[406:54.96]We're going to finish this game.
[406:57.20]And hopefully by then I will have a controller that doesn't just disconnect for no reason.
[407:07.06]No funny zoo game?
[407:09.83]No, not until this is done.
[407:11.19]And maybe not again.
[407:12.27]I don't know.
[407:12.65]We'll see.
[407:14.55]Where's Planet Zoo?
[407:15.29]I just played it yesterday.
[407:19.37]No, no, no, not... I don't know.
[407:21.74]We'll find out.
[407:23.80]We're going to be stuck on the boss for the whole next stream.
[407:25.72]No, we won't.
[407:27.44]Because I'm going to look up how to beat it by incredibly cheeseball dogshit strategy.
[407:33.46]I'm just going to type in motorcycle lady cheeseball strategy.
[407:39.47]And just look it up.
[407:40.63]Whatever.
[407:41.01]Who cares?
[407:45.57]And we'll see what happens tomorrow.
[407:47.79]I had a lot of fun with this game, though.
[407:49.45]Besides the random, like, three or four times where I was just like... So, it's been fun.
[407:56.11]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[407:57.56]Same time.
[407:59.70]Same place.
[408:03.20]Did you hear the dog?
[408:09.92]I think he just yelled at me.
[408:15.56]That was Dead Rising part run.
[408:16.88]Guitar part run.
[408:18.68]Actually, that was what I was doing the whole time.
[408:26.45]Let's do the bits.
[408:32.11]You know, sometimes I just check to see if this works.
[408:36.05]But it doesn't.
[408:37.05]That's alright.
[408:42.00]That's going to be the YouTube title.
[408:47.16]Alright, so seven hours ago here we had... Doggo, good boy, thanks for the 500 bits.
[408:53.08]Are you going to attempt a seven-day survival challenge after you beat the game?
[408:58.60]I don't even know what that is.
[409:00.12]We'll have to see after what happens tomorrow.
[409:07.17]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[409:11.65]Judging by how well I'm able to manage most of the survivors, I don't think that's going to happen.
[409:19.67]What is that?
[409:19.95]If you die once, it's over?
[409:22.09]Just like hardcore mode, that would be so horrible.
[409:26.13]Seven days is like hard mode, yeah.
[409:29.59]Don't you have an appointment tomorrow?
[409:30.60]No, I had it wrong.
[409:32.22]It's the next day, so we're streaming tomorrow.
[409:36.06]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[409:37.34]If memory serves me right, the best weapon is the mannequin torso.
[409:41.00]I remembered it.
[409:42.56]One shots most zombies and has good durability.
[409:46.50]That's a good tip.
[409:47.86]I'll take it.
[409:51.33]It's seven real days.
[409:57.02]That's... A long time.
[410:01.56]That's a very long time.
[410:07.64]I'll try it out.
[410:08.54]I'll try it tomorrow.
[410:10.50]Just say yes or no.
[410:11.00]I paid money for this.
[410:28.41]I don't even know, I don't even remember what the hell that was.
[410:30.63]I have no idea.
[410:32.58]Is there a character in this game?
[410:41.28]There's a lot of people that I've come across already.
[410:49.17]Good answer.
[410:51.61]It's the only answer because I really don't even know who they're talking about.
[410:56.94]But thank you for the 250, appreciate it.
[410:58.10]Thank you, Bobo Durango, for the 300 bits.
[411:01.42]Remember, there's a secret katana sword weapon on the awning if you jump off the second floor food court rail.
[411:08.25]Right, I look, okay, I know that there's, like, secret weapons and items.
[411:12.85]I don't know that's there.
[411:14.56]I have no idea.
[411:17.62]Jump off into the awning and grab the katana!
[411:22.56]That's metagaming.
[411:23.60]He told you.
[411:24.48]Well, now I know it's there, and that's cheating.
[411:26.26]But it's okay, we're cheating now.
[411:27.28]Because I don't care.
[411:30.00]Tell me everything.
[411:31.51]Tell me where the bazooka is, so I can stuff it into that fucking girl on the bike's face.
[411:45.62]GTA hacker.
[411:50.50]But, yeah, I'll start picking it up.
[411:57.18]Thank you to... Kimono Friend Zone.
[412:02.60]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[412:03.78]15 bucks.
[412:06.50]Jerma, not even kidding, the mannequin torso is the most powerful weapon in the game.
[412:13.16]He's like... Otto's like angry with me right now.
[412:15.42]Why?
[412:16.80]He's just like, hey!
[412:18.98]What is he doing?
[412:23.54]He's like, let me out.
[412:24.97]Let me out.
[412:25.35]Where is he?
[412:25.79]Oh, let me see what he's doing.
[412:26.71]Let me just see what's wrong with him.
[412:29.72]He's yelling at me.
[412:31.06]Be right back.
[413:05.28]I don't know.
[413:06.72]He's just sitting outside my door going like, hey.
[413:09.86]He's eaten.
[413:10.38]He's been outside.
[413:12.27]And now he's just hanging out.
[413:14.03]Okay.
[413:15.91]Well, I'll see what you want in just a few minutes, I tell you.
[413:18.97]He talks.
[413:19.45]Yeah.
[413:23.63]But I'll try the mannequin torso tomorrow.
[413:25.31]Maybe I can kill her with a mannequin torso.
[413:32.25]Thank you, Dark Soul, for the $2.50.
[413:35.20]Thank you, okay.
[414:04.40]Thanks for the 250.
[414:05.22]Appreciate it.
[414:05.66]Thank you, Al2653, for the thousand bits.
[414:11.50]Jerma, let me give you a couple basic tips for the game.
[414:14.30]Always keep a couple of healing items on you.
[414:16.12]Arrange weapon and a couple of good melee weapons at all times.
[414:19.12]Keep an eye out for save points, too.
[414:20.34]Save any time you enter a new area, baby.
[414:23.00]And ultimately, keep an eye on your main quest religiously.
[414:25.20]Keep it up, man.
[414:25.72]We all love you, even when we get angry, too.
[414:27.78]I mean, I was told that Dead Rising is an angry game.
[414:35.01]Before I played Dead Rising, somebody told me, hey, the bosses in that game are dog shit.
[414:39.50]I was like, what are you talking about?
[414:42.06]Yeah, you're going to get really annoyed with them.
[414:45.08]I'm like, no, I'm not.
[414:46.56]Dead Rising.
[414:48.44]This is me in the mirror, by the way.
[414:58.25]Somebody just said that like 40 minutes ago.
[415:02.71]and then because somebody said it in chat it was like I can say it now too I really like Dead Rising but like the boss is really like like dumb the bosses are like dumb the bosses are dumb I didn't say it the bosses are dumb and then I said people like what are you talking about oh somebody said that like somebody said that in chat I'm just like yeah that's you think that too
[415:37.89]Local comedian stealing joke from the audience.
[415:40.43]I was saying that a boss is dumb, a joke.
[415:46.57]I'm not gonna get on Johnny Carson with that one, guys.
[415:55.28]Never said it was funny.
[415:56.30]Oh, that's true, you know, you're right.
[416:02.44]Alright, Calusia, thanks for the $2.50.
[416:05.35]Hey, let's put the credits up, too.
[416:08.07]Why not, right?
[416:10.91]Roll them.
[416:12.52]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[416:13.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[416:19.84]Colusia, thanks for the 250.
[416:20.76]Hey, Jeremy, what's up?
[416:22.44]It's my birthday this Friday, so here's some pre-birthday money.
[416:25.58]Also, do you think you could say my name, Mia, so I can edit it into the rat's birthday mixtape?
[416:29.87]Yeah, absolutely.
[416:30.79]Thanks, Jeremy.
[416:31.45]Much love.
[416:32.85]You don't even need to edit it.
[416:34.45]Happy birthday, Mia.
[416:36.05]Mia, it's your birthday today.
[416:39.22]Ice cream and shit is on the way.
[416:40.94]Use that.
[416:46.72]Thanks, everybody, for your subs.
[416:48.85]And your continued subscriptions.
[416:50.21]It's...
[416:57.80]Sorry.
[416:58.18]I just, like, fucking completely blanked.
[417:00.76]I'm looking at my phone.
[417:03.12]I just, like, thanks, everyone, for the subs.
[417:06.38]I got a notification on my phone, and my brain turned off.
[417:11.49]Okay.
[417:12.11]We're back.
[417:13.27]No, seriously, thanks, everybody, for the subs.
[417:15.69]And your extraordinary support of the channel.
[417:20.91]It means a lot.
[417:21.37]He would rather look at his phone.
[417:22.31]No, no, no.
[417:22.75]It was like a... My light on my phone lit up.
[417:27.10]And I have like the brain of a fucking squirrel or something.
[417:31.00]Or like a rat.
[417:31.36]Phone light.
[417:39.69]Yeah, because I don't have notifications to sound on during a stream.
[417:43.78]Otherwise it would just be like... You guys don't want to hear that.
[417:55.07]But, uh, happy birthday to Mia.
[417:59.67]Thank you.
[418:00.47]Sad Vega, thanks for the $2.50.
[418:01.49]If there is ever a zombie apocalypse, you don't get to be the leader.
[418:07.13]Yeah, people were like, giving me shit about, you'd be so bad in a zombie apocalypse, you don't know where you are.
[418:12.99]Like, as if I'm just blindfolded, walking around my house.
[418:22.84]You know, I don't need to know where I am.
[418:24.04]I just need to move my arms up and down, left and right, real fast, really hard.
[418:31.00]With a sword.
[418:32.52]I can do that really well.
[418:37.64]And a shitload of canned food.
[418:45.63]Oh, okay, so I'm apparently doing it wrong.
[418:51.40]I'm just gonna have a go-kart that's full with, like, a train of wagons behind me that all has canned food in it.
[419:01.72]And it's all gonna be covered up so nobody knows what it is.
[419:04.44]He's gonna starve within 24 hours.
[419:15.64]That face when you gotta kill zombie Jerm of Pepe hands.
[419:30.37]No, I ain't ever turning.
[419:37.21]It's not gonna happen.
[419:40.57]I'm too sneaky.
[419:46.33]But... Thank you, SadVega.
[419:49.99]Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[419:51.13]Ever gonna do another system games collection stream like you did with the Dreamcast and PlayStation?
[419:56.51]Might be something... Might be fun with something like the GameCube or DS.
[420:01.70]Um... Not in the immediate future.
[420:05.48]I mean, the GameCube is really cool.
[420:11.60]But I would need to... You know, at one point I was thinking about it.
[420:21.89]I wanted to do an Atari stream.
[420:24.44]Just get all the old, old Atari games and play them all.
[420:26.92]There are as many as I could in over the course of a day or two.
[420:30.12]That stream would probably get really boring though, because every Atari game is almost the same game.
[420:39.32]So, after like 25 Atari games, it'd probably be like, okay, there's only so many stick figure jumps across the lake that we can do in a row.
[420:55.83]But yeah, I think about it sometimes.
[421:00.40]I guess the progression.
[421:04.50]PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Dreamcast.
[421:10.86]GameCube.
[421:11.44]Nintendo 64.
[421:12.34]I mean, there's a lot of them.
[421:17.15]Are you ever going to play Code Vein?
[421:18.85]I forgot about that.
[421:19.79]I bought it too.
[421:22.69]To stream it.
[421:29.40]I don't know.
[421:30.62]You said you were gonna play it.
[421:33.04]Yeah, I know.
[421:35.05]Well, I said I wanted to.
[421:36.85]And then I put a vote up, I think.
[421:38.85]And, like, 12% of people clicked on Code Vein.
[421:43.05]It was like, I... At least make a dumb character in it.
[421:56.93]That's because we had the thing.
[421:59.45]That's true.
[422:01.45]Maybe I'll revisit it soon.
[422:03.13]I don't know.
[422:04.01]I can't get... I don't want to get everybody's hopes up and just be like, yeah, maybe.
[422:06.93]I don't know.
[422:12.38]I don't really have a plan.
[422:14.68]But, hey, Errorless, thanks for the 250.
[422:16.58]Jerm of Saturn.
[422:17.72]Cool.
[422:20.04]It's an underused emote, I think.
[422:22.88]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 250.
[422:24.76]I haven't seen you get that mad since Hotline Miami.
[422:29.80]When?
[422:32.60]Wait, what?
[422:33.30]This?
[422:34.08]What just happened?
[422:39.52]When did I get mad?
[422:43.47]I mean, during the motorcycle part?
[422:44.69]Oh, absolutely.
[422:47.67]That was seven minutes ago.
[422:50.03]So angry.
[422:50.77]Somebody already has a clip of this.
[422:52.95]Yeah, I mean, well, come on.
[422:53.99]Like, I'm getting, like, turned on a dime with a lady on a motorcycle.
[422:58.97]That's like, that's, that's bullshit.
[423:02.87]She's driving through debris like it's nothing.
[423:09.46]Hold on, what do I do here?
[423:13.76]Stupid, like, NPC shitheads!
[423:16.16]Get away from me!
[423:17.20]Get out of here!
[423:18.48]Is this three?
[423:19.24]Oh, I am so angry right now, you have no idea.
[423:21.72]This is so stupid!
[423:23.84]Ugh!
[423:32.80]I cooled off right there.
[423:33.78]That's fine.
[423:38.49]It was a little bit.
[423:44.08]That's not Hotline Miami tear anger.
[423:46.65]It is not.
[423:49.85]not no no I can tell you as the guy sitting in the chair not even close not even close oh Hotline Miami I was just I hated it I like hated the there was like three levels in a row there I was just like oh I was inconsolable I hated that he hates it my Hotline Miami no it was hotline made me too that's probably the most upset I've ever been on stream like recorded
[424:21.06]Hotline Miami 1, I don't think I had a problem with it.
[424:24.12]It was 2, yeah.
[424:27.81]Oh.
[424:28.83]If you got a level between, like, Hotline Miami 2 was up at the top, and Drinking While Playing Nintendo Labo was at the bottom, that was probably somewhere into, like, the thing, stream number 2,
[424:47.19]when I was walking around that corridor for like 20 minutes.
[424:52.21]That's like maybe like two or three rungs below Hotline Miami 2.
[425:04.21]But that didn't even last that long.
[425:05.77]No, no, no.
[425:09.01]Yeah, that clip right there was like the extent of me being upset with Dead Rising.
[425:14.03]I was like, no, I was mad at the controller because my controller kept fucking going crazy.
[425:18.46]Not mad at the game.
[425:24.92]I know that's incredibly, that's a meme.
[425:27.56]I was mad at the controller.
[425:28.48]My controller's fucked up.
[425:29.32]My controller's broken.
[425:30.72]It was.
[425:33.02]I didn't even need to prove that.
[425:37.05]Imagine if I was just unplugging it on purpose over and over again and pretending to be angry with it.
[425:48.70]That would be such a pain in the ass.
[425:54.56]That would be a pain in the ass.
[425:57.14]But imagine... Now I said it, and now it's in people's heads.
[426:04.16]And you can never take it back.
[426:06.90]Anyways, thank you to Dr. Steam for the 500 vids.
[426:08.94]Jerma, are you going to participate in the big Minecraft streamer-only event that takes place on a huge world map?
[426:15.55]Uh, no.
[426:17.79]Do you even know about it?
[426:20.31]I do not, and I'm not going to be participating.
[426:28.45]Yo, that sounds pog.
[426:30.87]I mean, that sounds pretty cool.
[426:34.21]We already signed you up.
[426:36.19]That's not how this works.
[426:45.04]You guys aren't like my parents.
[426:49.59]Making sure I do some extracurricular activities.
[426:52.43]So you signed me up for like the French horn.
[426:55.51]That's not how this works.
[427:05.89]We said you would host it.
[427:10.91]Oh, wow.
[427:11.41]That would be ridiculous.
[427:13.41]No.
[427:13.99]Okay.
[427:14.35]I need to stop talking because let me be very clear here.
[427:18.25]I am not going to participate in that event.
[427:22.27]I wish him luck.
[427:23.15]Sounds cool.
[427:24.28]I will not be participating.
[427:25.52]There you go.
[427:27.90]Done.
[427:30.78]Hey, James, aka Bath Bomb Boy.
[427:34.81]That was not the name before, was it?
[427:35.83]I feel like it was a different name.
[427:54.99]I work at Lush making bat bombs.
[427:57.19]Well, anyways, most of the people are especially so when especially... What is it?
[428:02.21]What?
[428:03.17]English?
[428:03.51]There's two English people that are speaking English.
[428:08.00]What is it?
[428:08.32]What are you talking about?
[428:09.76]There are two... Most of the people are ESL.
[428:13.74]Oh, okay.
[428:17.96]You should have a career day stream where us fans can show you our unique jobs.
[428:23.48]Well, I'd love to chat more, but at tis point, it's cheaper to talk to a sex hotline instead of giving you bits.
[428:35.26]Alright, BF Bugleberry could use a bath bomb.
[428:38.31]What the fuck is going on here?
[428:45.89]BF Bugleberry could use a bath bomb.
[428:54.26]What are these comments?
[428:57.19]I mean, I kind of get the gist of it.
[429:00.43]Have a career day, though?
[429:01.63]That would be, like, interesting, I guess.
[429:03.25]Oh, what?
[429:03.81]I didn't even put a... Nope, turn that one down.
[429:05.49]This one.
[429:05.77]Because we're at the end.
[429:10.93]Errorless at the final bit.
[429:12.69]Thanks for the $2.50, and take care, everybody.
[429:15.01]That's the final one, you're right.
[429:17.73]Alright, guys, I'll see you tomorrow for the conclusion, the second half of Dead Rising 1.
[429:25.84]Thank you.
[429:27.70]See you soon.
[429:31.94]Have a great rest of your night.
[429:35.28]Join us tomorrow.
[429:38.22]I'll have a new controller by then.
[429:40.66]And I will be locked in to push that fucking lady off her bike.
[429:44.68]You got it.
[429:49.65]Take care.
[429:49.95]Have a great night.
[429:51.15]A grace night.
[429:52.21]A great night.
[429:56.22]I could probably use some peanut butter or something.
[430:01.64]Good night.
[430:02.40]See you tomorrow.
[430:04.98]I just saw a cat falling out of the tree.
[430:08.80]That has not left me in almost two days.
[430:10.29]Alright.
[430:15.39]Good night.
[430:15.77]Goodbye.
[430:16.11]See you tomorrow.
[430:16.71]Take care.
[430:26.51]Thank you.
[431:01.40]you
