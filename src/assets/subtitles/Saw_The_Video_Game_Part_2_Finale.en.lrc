[01:10.56]How did this even happen?
[01:15.18]Lying?
[01:15.52]Why would I lie about that?
[01:19.45]I can't go back to Ratatouille right now.
[01:21.17]The save point is like 20 minutes before I even got to that point.
[01:24.65]No, we're good.
[01:25.09]We're good.
[01:25.33]Here we go.

[02:05.53]It's been like, it's been like three months.

[17:06.27]You put it on very hard mode.
[17:08.25]Yeah, cool.
[17:20.25]That's the joke mode that was on old puzzle games that nobody... Wow, I'm never going to be able to do this shit.
[17:26.59]I put the hard difficulty scale up the whole way.
[17:29.27]No way this is happening.
[17:30.53]Get the fuck over here.
[17:35.17]Fuck you.

[18:23.90]I'm trying to select this one.
[18:30.39]Like, it's so bad.
[18:32.79]It's unbelievably awful.
[18:34.51]Don't bolt the door.

[19:29.88]I need one of those things.
[19:30.86]Go back to the box.
[19:43.85]I think there was a reason why I said I'm never playing this fucking piece of shit ever again.
[20:07.50]I need a valve.
[20:12.48]Go run around and look at every fucking stupid wardrobe to find the one thing I need.
[20:25.47]Oh, shut up, Saw.

[22:17.88]Now I need, I need, what do I need now?
[22:22.37]I got a few minutes.
[22:22.91]I have to turn on the pipe thing.
[22:26.05]Do I have that now?
[22:26.75]Where's my inventory?
[22:30.85]I think it's got it.
[22:31.47]I don't know.
[22:31.77]I think it's got it.
[22:32.31]Fucking walk!
[22:39.74]I got three minutes.
[22:40.42]Go.
[23:02.54]Fuck.
[23:05.66]Why?
[23:06.20]Why?
[23:08.69]I didn't take it?
[23:12.61]You can't be serious.
[23:16.17]Take all.
[23:17.26]A. I pressed A. I pressed A. Why would I not have pressed A?
[23:24.66]Stupid feature.
[23:30.54]Thank God this is pretty simple.
[23:31.78]This is the easy one.
[23:39.25]Oh, shit.
[23:39.77]I can't do the easy one.
[23:40.69]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[23:47.83]What is this?
[23:56.03]What the fuck?
[24:10.34]That was for a scalpel.
[24:12.08]That was for a scalpel.
[24:15.18]That wasn't even anything I needed.
[24:16.80]Get the fuck out of here, man.
[24:36.02]No, no way.
[24:37.18]I'm sorry.
[24:37.76]No way.
[24:38.84]No fucking way.
[24:43.17]Un-fucking-believable.
[24:44.47]Why would- this is a dump.
[24:46.39]This is like not even cool.
[24:51.84]I'm dead.
[25:13.86]Um, okay, so... I... Can we get a picture of the completed puzzle so I can just go through them and just do it and just get out of this room?
[25:26.86]I'm gonna go look up a walkthrough and just look at the completed puzzle and just get every single one correct.
[25:33.14]It's random.
[25:34.46]It's random.
[25:35.50]It's random.
[25:36.88]Oh, shit.
[25:41.06]Okay, slow down.
[25:43.11]Here we go.
[25:50.62]Left side first.
[25:51.32]Go.
[25:51.48]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[26:22.00]Open!
[26:22.20]Alright, I gotta do this quick.
[26:26.81]I'm so bad at these puzzles, though.
[26:28.39]It's not even funny.
[26:29.07]I don't even have one.
[26:33.21]Got it.
[26:33.43]Okay, there's one there.
[26:34.09]Hurry up.
[26:52.80]I don't even... I don't want to do this anymore.
[26:54.90]I would rather play Ratatouille.
[26:56.87]I'd rather show my fucking beehive nuts on stream than do this.
[27:36.16]What a pain in the ass.
[27:39.30]What a total pain in the ass.
[27:40.62]I don't fucking know if this is even right.
[27:49.56]This shit's not even right.
[27:59.86]Go back, I'm begging you.
[28:00.67]This stream isn't funny anymore.
[28:01.89]Ratatouille is funnier.
[28:02.83]Fuck, please.
[28:14.78]So, like, alright.
[28:15.68]You know, like, you think of, like, the Saw video game.
[28:20.98]I know everyone wanted me to complete this, but this is dog shit.
[28:25.61]Let's be honest.
[28:26.35]We gotta be completely upfront.
[28:28.11]Doing, like, the pipe dream puzzle over and over again, like, a thousand times, this game just sucks.
[28:44.10]I should really just run around and get all the couplers.
[28:50.36]Mad because bad.
[28:51.58]No, I am bad.
[28:54.26]You're right.
[28:54.72]But, oh my god.
[28:56.28]Why do you want... Who wants to do like five of these in a row with a timer?
[29:00.31]Alright, quiet.
[29:14.57]Get them all connected.
[29:16.15]Do it right.
[29:16.83]You got it.
[29:34.99]This is for fucking going up there.
[30:08.22]I need this connected.
[30:08.82]I need this connected to something.
[30:09.99]Where's the power?
[30:12.05]I need this connected.
[30:13.01]What the fuck am I gonna connect this to?
[30:21.32]Oh, you piece of shit.
[30:38.02]It's like too... Dumb ass fucking game.
[30:47.26]Dumbest fucking game on Twitch right now.
[30:52.84]This is not connected to shit.
[30:59.24]How do I get this?
[31:00.10]I gotta fucking... Okay.
[31:01.94]Connected to that.
[31:02.92]Now this is...
[31:09.34]This goes up.
[31:09.72]Oh, fuck!
[31:20.33]How do I connect you?
[31:21.27]This took too long!
[31:31.68]I got like three- I got two minutes left to do like eight other puzzles!
[31:39.14]Who made this game?
[31:40.70]I'm embarrassed for them.
[31:56.23]Go outside in.
[31:57.67]Go out.
[32:06.25]I turned it off.
[32:13.58]Are there cheat codes for this game?
[32:14.60]Can I just cheat and just fucking noclip through the door?
[32:16.64]There's four of those puzzles.
[32:22.16]There's five puzzles in seven minutes.
[32:24.42]Guys, that means I have to do every puzzle in less than one minute.
[32:27.38]Is that even possible to do that in seven minutes?
[32:28.95]This has to be the last room of the game.
[32:55.69]You wish.
[33:00.35]It's just too much, man.
[33:03.44]It's just too many things to look at.
[33:05.64]It's too confusing.
[33:07.88]Shut up.
[33:08.24]Turn the fucking TV off.
[33:09.28]I don't want to hear him anymore.
[33:19.56]My brain's like too tired to do this.
[33:22.12]I hate this.
[33:24.29]I hate these puzzles too, by the way.
[33:26.33]Of all the puzzles they could be, these are like my least favorite.
[33:48.67]Okay, hold on, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-

[35:14.15]I can't.
[35:14.81]I can't.
[35:15.75]I can't.

[35:19.59]There's one more.

[39:07.10]I got it wrong somewhere.
[39:08.16]This one thing wrong.

[39:14.50]This is connected to here.
[39:15.46]This is connected to there.
[39:16.56]This has to be connected here.
[39:18.26]This has to be connected to here.
[39:20.08]But then you lose this fucking thing.
[39:23.62]And then... I don't understand.
[39:28.66]I don't understand!
[39:41.12]It's just the last piece!
[39:42.38]I have to pause the game.
[39:45.44]Oh my god, I hate this fucking game with a passion.
[39:48.67]This is the worst game I've ever played on stream.
[39:51.09]I want to dropkick this fucking disc into the dumpster.
[39:57.43]Okay.
[39:58.41]You ready?
[40:01.01]I'm taking a screenshot of this.
[40:01.91]And we're going to up the contrast.
[40:07.12]Okay, so.
[40:08.38]The bottom...
[40:14.61]Yeah, I don't need to take a screenshot.
[40:16.07]You're right.
[40:16.33]Okay.
[40:18.53]This is a screenshot.
[40:19.31]Alright, I'm going to unpause the game and somebody... Okay, here we go.
[40:24.51]Ready?
[40:25.69]Take a screenshot.
[40:26.31]I probably should have told you to do that beforehand.
[40:35.06]Did you get it?
[40:35.64]Did somebody get it?
[40:37.48]Okay.
[40:38.04]This is stupid.
[40:39.98]Alright, so wait.
[40:41.08]Is this the puzzle solved?
[40:43.52]Did you edit this?
[40:51.00]Okay, the middle right needs to go... I need to, like, draw on stream.
[40:59.37]Can somebody draw a picture on there?
[41:02.57]Alright, somebody draw a picture.
[41:03.79]I need you to draw a picture.
[41:04.69]Somebody take that photo and draw over it the way it's supposed to look like.
[41:09.90]It should take you, like, two minutes, right?
[41:10.96]Like, not even a minute.
[41:11.68]I don't want to do this again.
[41:12.80]I fucking hate this.
[41:27.09]I don't care.
[41:27.81]I'm going to wait until somebody gets me the right picture.
[41:34.65]It's not even the middle right one.
[41:36.19]Okay, did you get it?
[41:46.94]No, not pixel dick.
[41:48.16]Not pixel dick.
[41:53.31]What are you linking me to?
[41:55.68]I don't know, this is, that's Yoda.
[41:57.08]That's Yoda.
[41:57.70]Please, I need you to help me.
[42:01.98]Pixel penis.
[42:02.84]Yeah, cool.
[42:04.88]I can't, I can't throw that on stream.
[42:08.68]Somebody please help me.
[42:12.56]This is Super Monkey Ball, again, but with, like, the stupidest shittiest puzzles.
[42:19.90]Yeah, that's the image, but you didn't... I know.
[42:21.86]I already have the image, but I need correction on it.
[42:24.00]I need you to do it for me.
[42:30.60]Just go and paint and draw what it's supposed to look like.
[42:39.90]You solve it.
[42:40.48]Yeah, you'll get it.
[42:41.23]Somebody will get it.
[42:42.19]I'm not unpausing until I can verify what it looks like.
[42:45.39]Mods, verify this.
[42:46.51]Okay.
[42:47.43]I think somebody's got it.
[42:51.22]What?
[42:51.70]No, you don't.
[42:52.30]Alright, hold on.
[42:52.94]What am I looking at here, though?
[43:06.93]This is it.
[43:07.47]Alright.
[43:07.71]No, no, no.
[43:07.97]I think this is it.
[43:08.51]Somebody's got it.
[43:14.30]Okay.
[43:14.64]Somebody's got it.
[43:15.36]You got it.
[43:15.62]You got it.
[43:15.86]You got it.
[43:17.70]Okay.
[43:18.48]So...
[43:20.17]It looks like we got the cross in the middle.
[43:22.76]The cross in the middle does not connect anything down there.
[43:26.26]This looks alright.
[43:27.78]I gotta turn the one that's blinking right now over to the left.
[43:31.24]Like that.
[43:34.22]Okay.
[43:36.08]Then I gotta get the one right below it.
[43:43.24]Be like this.
[43:43.86]Okay.
[43:45.35]Turn that one down there.
[43:50.01]Good.
[43:51.82]This next one.
[43:52.46]Remember, this is a children's game.
[43:54.54]It's rated M for mature.
[43:55.32]You can't even go in and your parents would have to buy this for you.
[43:57.24]Bad parent.
[43:57.72]Bad parent.
[43:58.22]Okay, then it comes out of there.
[44:01.36]Goes down and then goes this way.
[44:05.58]Then it goes up.
[44:07.14]Okay.
[44:09.54]This one goes which way?
[44:10.78]Left.
[44:11.70]Good.
[44:11.88]Okay.
[44:15.64]Then it goes straight over and this one goes down like this.
[44:20.71]Okay.
[44:21.71]And then this one goes up.
[44:24.17]The one down here goes up, up.
[44:26.56]The one goes there to the left.
[44:30.59]That's it.
[44:30.87]I did it.
[44:31.87]I got it.
[44:32.33]Okay, I'm good.
[44:49.84]Fucking game.
[44:51.42]This game sucks.
[44:56.60]Okay.
[44:57.12]Here you go, guys.
[44:58.38]You ready for this?
[45:02.06]We're gonna play a game called... Oh.
[45:25.58]I need to go get the couplers first.
[45:27.22]There better be one right here.
[45:30.39]I'm going to scream.
[45:30.95]Thank God.
[45:33.49]Okay.
[45:34.93]Hey, guys.
[45:37.07]Take a screenshot.
[45:39.73]Somebody saw the whole fucking thing.
[45:41.14]I just broke it.
[45:48.50]I think I broke the controller.
[45:51.72]Somebody has to stop the whole thing.
[46:03.51]Why even play?
[46:05.27]I know.
[46:07.67]Oh.
[47:20.13]Come on!
[47:27.80]That was good time.
[47:28.62]That was pretty good time.
[47:31.60]That actually was not bad time.
[47:34.37]I got five minutes.
[47:35.01]I need another decoupler, though.
[47:40.57]Slow down.

[47:47.18]Where is it?
[47:47.70]It's right in here.
[47:48.84]Did I get it?
[47:49.26]Good, good, good, good.
[47:50.04]Okay, decoupler.

[51:30.28]You did a good job solving this puzzle.
[51:35.92]Please play my game, Jerma.
[51:37.00]I'm not sure what you have against rats.
[51:38.58]Chuck E. Cheese will not be happy about this.
[51:43.19]Okay.
[51:43.47]Alright, you got it?

[52:18.95]All right.
[52:19.19]So...
[52:21.12]It goes... It'll have to go down.
[52:25.37]It goes... Yeah, that's right.
[52:29.35]Wait, did you just trace what I did?
[52:34.19]This has to go up.
[52:36.93]That.
[52:39.31]Then this has to go sideways like this.
[52:44.21]This goes down, up.
[52:45.75]This one curves over.
[52:46.61]Nice.
[52:49.03]Almost done.
[52:55.20]What happened here?
[52:56.96]This is correct.
[52:57.88]This is the way I have it.
[53:06.94]What am I doing wrong?
[53:08.18]Isn't this right?

[53:21.97]Hold on.
[53:25.85]Top middle piece goes up.
[53:29.74]Okay.
[53:30.42]You didn't solve it.
[53:31.26]You just did one part.
[53:34.74]You can't say solved and just correct one of the mistakes.
[53:50.44]Change the three-way piece.
[53:55.29]Oh shit, did I do it?
[54:16.86]Solve it.
[54:17.24]Solve it.

[54:53.95]What's wrong?
[54:55.89]Oh, oh!
[54:59.02]I have 13 seconds.
[55:01.08]I have 13 seconds to get out of here.
[55:23.22]Oh, my God.
[55:24.55]Thank goodness.
[55:25.21]Holy shit.
[55:29.51]Oh, my fucking God.
[55:30.81]Thank you, God.
[55:31.71]Thank you, the stream savers.
[55:36.54]I hated every second of that.
[55:38.00]Thank God I don't have to keep falling down in Ratatouille.
[55:41.82]Crematory.
[55:52.68]Audio tape.
[56:03.05]Save the game?
[56:04.05]I can't.
[56:04.77]It does it at random intervals.
[56:12.72]Checkpoint in here, right?
[56:14.92]Place the frozen hand into the furnace.
[56:16.40]Alright, give me a checkpoint.
[56:18.62]Where's the fucking checkpoint, guys?
[56:20.22]Where's the checkpoint?
[56:33.25]Got the crematorium key.
[56:38.54]I got a Minecraft stake.
[57:02.26]You've come to the streamer room.
[57:04.49]He's isolated himself and is broadcasting Fortnite.
[57:10.29]He hasn't been outside in over two months.
[57:14.27]Just don't boil the guy alive.
[57:17.45]I think I can get it.
[57:37.27]Okay, here we go.
[57:39.45]Outside in.
[57:40.87]That's wrong.
[57:44.15]Right, that's correct.
[57:56.16]Done.
[57:58.04]Part two.
[58:03.76]Nope, wrong.
[58:04.54]Wrong.
[58:18.46]Fuck, wrong.
[58:22.07]This is super, this is ultra wrong.
[58:29.51]He's already dead?
[58:30.35]Alright, this is very wrong.
[58:35.90]Um.
[58:40.00]Good?
[58:42.42]No, kind of.
[58:53.89]There it is.
[58:54.23]There it is.
[58:54.51]Got it.
[58:58.27]I'm gonna save him.
[58:58.83]It's good.
[58:59.25]I've got plenty of time.
[59:01.61]It's my game, actually.
[59:03.97]Okay, maybe that looks good.
[59:06.27]How's that?
[59:09.35]Close.
[59:09.89]It's close.
[59:10.23]It's pretty close.
[59:14.95]Fuck.
[59:21.49]Right there.
[59:23.19]Shit.
[59:23.49]Wrong.
[59:28.87]Fuck.
[59:29.13]There it is.
[59:32.05]All right, come on out.
[59:39.32]You ruined it.
[59:40.64]You ruined my game.
[59:42.02]It was mine, not yours.
[59:44.92]What are you talking about?
[59:46.20]I almost aced the last people 10 v 1.
[59:49.74]Put an ad in the paper.
[59:50.82]I was going to get on the front page of Twitch.
[59:52.80]Begging to be tested, to learn.
[59:57.32]I wasn't ready to come out yet.
[59:58.32]Sound of the bat hitting him right in the forehead as hard as I can.
[60:01.93]I had the choice.
[60:30.77]You have bare feet.
[60:31.91]Oh, okay.
[60:33.43]Find Jigsaw's next clue.
[60:36.65]Don't hit him until you get a checkpoint.
[60:38.19]That's important.
[60:42.02]Most people avoid pain and suffering.
[60:45.20]But not you, detective.
[60:47.78]You relish it.
[60:49.62]You believe a life of pleasure is a life wasted.
[60:53.02]You have bare feet, I guess, yeah.
[60:55.14]Useless.
[60:57.81]Your next test is to release
[61:03.92]Can you save a man who does not want to be saved?
[61:06.36]Can you save a man who does not want to be saved?
[61:09.44]Come get this weapon.
[61:10.90]Here.
[61:11.20]Can I give you a weapon?
[61:14.38]I'll take the hatchet.
[61:15.06]Are you following me still?
[61:24.01]Come on, let's go.
[61:27.95]I'm much like Dead Rising.
[61:30.59]Ugh.
[61:32.73]Wait, what was I saying?
[61:40.14]okay follow me come on follow me come on come on follow me come on uh you do it you put your hand in there
[62:09.90]Oh, I just have to grab it.
[62:15.23]Don't spill it.
[62:16.05]I still have a hatchet, right?
[62:19.03]Find the clue.
[62:26.28]At least I'm not doing a fucking puzzle.
[62:29.23]That's me hitting him in the head with the bat and his head flying back so fast it hits the fucking concrete.
[62:35.67]Made out of aluminum.
[62:36.35]Alright, well he's gone.
[62:38.41]Really?
[63:01.13]That was stupid.
[63:07.83]Here comes the final clue.
[63:10.59]The final saw clue and then I can be done with this franchise until like next week when I play the second game.
[63:29.63]I made this pipe.
[63:30.45]Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.
[63:31.75]I don't have a gun.
[63:33.21]Where's there a shotgun?
[63:35.15]Okay.
[63:58.65]I have to go down.
[64:01.41]I got to ring these install light bulb.
[64:03.21]Right.
[64:03.49]This is going to be fun.
[64:05.03]It's going to be fantastic.
[64:06.02]I can't wait.
[64:08.20]Run around, open every draw to find a light bulb to put in here.
[64:17.12]All right, go down.
[64:20.72]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[64:22.20]Are you looking here?
[64:28.44]Is it going to be like a boss?
[64:31.06]Open up every drawer in the museum room.
[64:34.94]Oh, right.
[64:35.62]I see what you're doing.
[64:44.05]Tripwire.
[64:44.79]Sure.
[64:45.37]Oh, there's a whole bunch of shit over here.
[64:56.11]The lock.
[64:56.49]Get me in here.
[64:56.97]There's items in here.
[65:17.85]Remember, they're actually releasing another game at SawCon this weekend.
[65:25.70]I don't know what SawCon is, but I know it doesn't exist.
[65:28.58]Alright, let's see if I can do this.
[65:56.96]Explosive trap schematics and shotgun shell.
[66:01.80]Pretty much 100% useless.
[66:03.46]I'm glad I used a lockpick to get in here.
[66:04.94]Alright, let's do it.
[66:12.06]Whatever it is.
[66:12.52]Saw con... Sure.
[66:21.01]I don't know what the combo is.
[66:24.54]Okay, how long does it take to brute force a three digit password?
[66:31.98]Let's start at zero.
[66:44.90]I'm not gonna do that, I'm kidding.
[66:50.33]We didn't even get a code.
[66:54.84]That depends.
[66:57.00]No, please.
[66:57.54]I'm not gonna do that.
[67:03.88]643?
[67:03.90]No.
[67:04.00]823?
[67:04.02]No.
[67:04.08]373? 574?
[67:26.92]Find it.
[67:33.11]128.
[67:39.19]Find the numbers.
[67:40.07]I thought I just said it right there.
[67:44.60]Alright, fine.
[67:51.10]Let's go find the numbers.
[68:00.54]I don't want to play your game.
[68:01.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[68:02.86]Wait.
[68:04.60]Got something on you?
[68:11.63]Any numbers up here?
[68:24.41]Stage?
[68:26.11]Eh.
[68:28.51]Date on the poster.
[68:30.67]Oh, okay.
[68:34.55]I just dropped that.
[68:35.63]Get that back up.
[68:39.30]I don't even care.
[68:40.14]Just go.
[68:42.42]The table leg that was here.
[68:48.66]The date.
[68:50.06]November 18th, 19.
[68:50.66]That's 11... 11 and 18...
[69:00.42]It was a lie.
[69:01.16]Okay.
[69:08.46]Let's go over here.
[69:14.05]Storage.
[69:16.87]Got him.
[69:17.27]Do you have the code?
[69:25.84]What's the code?
[69:34.42]Still hit music.
[69:35.02]Alright, what is this shit?
[69:42.40]Turn this on?
[69:48.54]It's 181.
[69:49.91]Well, I'm already di- I'm already down here, so... What do I- I'm already down here!
[70:09.63]Here we go.
[70:10.87]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[70:11.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:12.37]Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[70:13.27]Here comes the code.
[70:15.23]The code.
[70:15.53]If anybody needs the code.
[70:17.37]The code.
[70:18.91]No code.
[70:24.42]The flashlight up?
[70:25.00]I already have one.
[70:27.46]This dude's going to jump around the corner.
[70:28.52]What do you think?
[70:28.96]I'm stupid?
[70:34.29]What?
[70:34.39]You think I'm an idiot?
[70:34.95]What?
[70:47.22]Another person is down here?
[70:49.06]Dean Venture?
[70:51.94]Alright, let's do it.
[71:15.01]Remember, go to SawCon for the code.
[71:16.96]There's no such thing as SawCon.
[71:18.56]A guy in a Saw mask shows up at, like, Horror Fest 2018 or whatever, but not here.
[71:28.74]Double.
[71:47.82]Holy shit, I almost just died, didn't I?
[71:55.26]Two paths converge on the same objective.
[71:59.19]The order is irrelevant.
[72:08.83]You are trapped in the room.
[72:11.44]With ten minutes to play the hardest level of Wrecking Crew.
[72:22.98]Hold on, who's texting me?
[72:29.49]Uh, hold on.
[72:30.53]Hold on, I gotta text somebody.
[72:34.93]Mom.
[72:37.35]One sec.
[72:42.87]Okay, no, there's no bit incoming.
[72:44.63]I'm not about to, like, no.
[72:46.29]I actually had to text somebody.
[72:49.07]Oh, I got a nail.
[72:52.11]Ma, you interrupted my... It wasn't my mom.
[72:56.17]I'm not gonna say it was my mom.
[72:57.21]My mom's probably watching right now and she's gonna be like, I didn't text that liar!
[73:01.76]What else?
[73:16.79]Ooh, a coupler.
[73:21.06]Alright, good.
[73:22.82]Good.
[73:30.33]What do you want me to do?
[73:34.83]I completely forgot that existed.
[73:37.41]Is it gonna shoot anyways?
[73:42.92]Ooh, health.
[73:43.44]I need it.
[73:43.70]Nail.
[73:46.42]Enter the code.
[73:47.14]Yeah, I don't know what the code is yet.
[73:58.18]Maybe I'll find the code here.
[73:59.08]Look at how much less ridiculous this one is, by the way.
[74:10.38]This one is not even close to being as insane as the other ones have been.
[74:34.47]Good.
[74:34.69]Press the button.
[74:40.93]Alright, they're both open.
[74:44.01]Let's go.
[74:44.95]Anything else in here that I need to get?
[74:45.97]Ooh, a medical cabinet.
[74:47.64]I think this is not good.
[74:57.56]Bandage is nice.
[74:58.16]Okay, good.
[75:03.13]Steal the Adderall.
[75:08.05]Did I really do all this today?
[75:09.19]I could have just skipped this by putting the code in.
[75:17.54]What was that?
[75:22.54]Nobody's walking.
[75:28.35]Uh...
[75:38.35]I know I got a weapon underneath I'm not even I shouldn't be scared because there's no monsters and so it's not like a giant dead space monsters gonna I mean I might look like the dead space guy right now like the thing that like doesn't have like a thing on his shoulders I was on his back never mind
[76:13.02]Okay, um, can I take the shotgun?
[76:18.47]Oh, I armed the trap.
[76:20.27]Somebody's gonna burst out of the door here.
[76:29.56]Well, what the hell is it?
[76:33.04]Fear.
[76:33.57]Guilt.
[76:42.01]This guy's dead already.
[76:44.44]This guy, he already killed him.
[76:49.96]This is pre-recorded.
[76:50.86]It wasn't like that!
[77:10.10]Alright, so he's dead.
[77:17.62]Find a light bulb within the staff housing.
[77:19.49]Find a light bulb.
[77:20.35]Find the combination to the cafeteria.
[77:23.95]Oh, fuck.
[77:26.63]What was it?
[77:26.99]Find a light bulb in the... Find a light bulb in the staff housing.
[77:30.65]Great.
[77:41.38]435.
[77:41.40]Is that for real?
[77:45.36]435?
[77:48.81]Wrong.
[77:50.13]838.
[77:50.17]That's wrong too.
[77:56.75]The light bulb is in your ass.
[78:06.16]Is it on?
[78:07.02]Is it like, boom?
[78:07.98]Is it on?
[78:08.58]I don't understand.
[78:12.45]I don't even know why I laughed that hard at that.
[78:20.62]That was a forehead laugh.
[78:22.12]It really was.
[78:30.39]Cafeteria.
[78:31.57]Where the hell?
[78:32.55]Find a light bulb in the staff room.
[78:36.51]Where's the stupid ass staff room?
[78:39.61]Current position of the objective.
[78:40.67]Circle.
[78:40.83]Circle.
[78:44.93]I don't know.
[78:45.41]I have no goddamn idea.
[78:47.83]Why is it something loading?
[78:50.63]I hear a guy.
[79:16.57]Code.
[79:17.65]What?
[79:19.65]Oh shit!
[79:20.27]038!
[79:21.33]Some of you guys almost got it too.
[79:35.28]838, how did you- You were close.
[79:40.70]Alright, find a light bulb in the cafeteria.
[79:48.46]Probably gonna need to use these.
[79:52.02]Okay, a guy's gonna blow through here with like a chainsaw.
[79:58.60]Where's the guy with the chainsaw?
[79:59.63]I know he's coming.
[80:07.45]Where is he?
[80:18.44]You would have solved it faster if you had just done your strategy of counting up from zero.
[80:26.53]That actually would have happened, you're right.
[80:29.45]That's ridiculous.
[80:30.77]You're right.
[80:43.20]What the hell is even in here?
[80:43.96]Crowbar?
[80:44.70]I got a better weapon already.
[80:47.93]Ooh.
[80:48.99]Explosive trap.
[80:51.81]Can't make it?
[80:53.95]Oh, I have gas trap.
[80:55.16]Stun trap.
[80:56.34]Explosive trap.
[80:57.18]I already have like a bunch of shit.
[80:58.18]How do I use this stuff?
[80:59.02]Almost died.
[81:11.91]You spam.
[81:15.11]Molotov?
[81:17.21]Hell yeah.
[81:19.76]Alright.
[81:22.40]This is the cat.
[81:22.92]Where's the thing I gotta get in here?
[81:25.28]On one of the doors or something?
[81:27.80]I don't know.
[81:32.32]Important.
[81:33.78]If you ever put a lightbulb in your ass, it'll get stuck and you can't get it out without breaking it.
[81:38.42]It explodes.
[81:39.70]The safest way to remove the bulb without maiming yourself is to feed a banana around the bulb.
[81:44.56]What the fuck are you talking about?
[81:57.23]I got a gear.
[82:02.00]I don't even... No one... Who's going to do that?
[82:04.42]Why would anybody do that?
[82:05.38]What you're describing.
[82:10.11]No one would ever do what you just said.
[82:14.27]No one.
[82:15.85]Not one person.
[82:16.68]I'm going to turn that shit off.
[82:28.02]How do I get that off?
[82:36.56]Would be in Saw.
[82:44.54]No one said ass?
[82:45.50]Yes, they did.
[82:47.02]Yes, they did.
[82:47.69]I need to turn... Where's a valve?
[82:54.67]I gotta turn the valve off somewhere, but where the fuck is a valve?
[83:00.41]Can I cap it?
[83:02.45]No.
[83:04.63]It said mouth.
[83:05.72]The one that I read did not say mouth.
[83:15.31]Oh, God.
[83:15.95]It's right in the corner.
[83:28.99]Ass lighted.
[83:29.71]Yeah, I mean, the one that I read said ass.
[83:43.14]Hello?
[83:46.32]Lot of molotovs.
[83:53.70]Alright, give me the lighter.
[84:01.90]What happened to the molotovs?
[84:05.41]I just had like a bunch of fucking molotovs.
[84:06.97]Where'd they go?
[84:07.41]Turn that shit off.
[84:16.12]I'm getting so lucky disarming these traps.
[84:19.22]You have no idea.
[84:35.46]What?
[84:37.12]What?
[84:38.16]Before look out.
[84:39.84]What's it supposed to say?
[84:50.30]Oh, before cooking.
[84:51.66]Cool.
[85:06.17]Before lookout.
[85:09.03]You know what I'm trying to say.
[85:14.82]Oh, before cooking.
[85:16.14]In the freezer.
[85:18.20]Whatever I'm supposed to put in here.
[85:22.42]Get a key.
[85:22.92]Nothing in this shit.
[85:29.35]Milk you piss.
[85:33.59]Jerk.
[85:35.10]Feed the grinder to get the key.
[85:40.68]Alright, feed the grinder, what, like my own arm?
[85:44.02]Feed the grinder to get the key.
[85:45.18]Can I put my own, can I just put like a shoe in there?
[86:01.27]Shortcut.
[86:08.61]Can I see any meat anywhere?
[86:09.61]I don't see anything.
[86:19.17]Dead guy on floor.
[86:20.55]Yeah, I don't think I can move him.
[86:30.90]No, I can't move him.
[86:35.42]Go down here.
[86:40.96]Mate, he has no head.
[86:46.24]Okay, this looks like an elaborate scheme.
[86:51.74]Sewing kit?
[86:55.62]Oh.
[86:58.57]Grind up the pigs?
[87:04.05]Hopefully there's not a timer.
[87:05.03]Okay, let's grind up some pigs.
[87:20.98]To throw bricks at the pigs and knock them down Somebody said this is a Zelda minigame Yeah, it is Carnival How many more out of how many people do
[87:52.76]This is getting a little full, I think.
[87:56.96]There's one more.
[88:02.00]You have to eat it.
[88:02.78]Did I do it?
[88:07.30]Oh, I got it.
[88:13.34]Enter the freezer.
[88:17.42]For my molotovs.
[88:18.40]I don't feel safe without the molotovs.
[88:28.99]Dude, I love this event.
[88:29.79]It's SawCon.
[88:32.91]Okay.
[88:33.59]Very, very important question.
[88:35.35]Does SawCon have more than 500 attendees?
[88:45.28]I don't think so.
[88:46.94]That answer is no.
[88:51.10]I don't think so.
[89:02.23]Probably not.
[89:02.87]I don't think it would.
[89:13.77]God.
[89:14.13]Oh my god.
[89:18.57]No, this is the end of the movie!
[89:26.47]This is gonna be absolute hell.
[89:27.91]Alright, this has to move forward.
[89:33.26]Let's just move forward.
[89:33.92]Let's go back, back, back.
[89:34.62]Back it up.
[89:42.49]Mmm, shit.
[89:43.43]Let's go forward.
[89:44.03]Let's just go... Is that enough room to move this?
[89:58.26]I have to move this one forward.
[90:19.82]Pull back.
[90:20.52]No, pull it back, you idiot.
[90:24.83]Use a Molotov.
[90:26.13]Good idea.
[90:32.99]Alright, I should be fine for a few minutes.
[90:45.43]Ugh.
[90:48.25]I can't even see anything.
[90:50.25]This default Photoshop fucking hair brush thing is... I can't see.
[90:54.56]Let's do it again.
[91:10.22]I'm not even doing this right.
[91:16.69]Throw them all tough, please.
[91:21.82]How the hell are you supposed to do anything like this?
[91:34.40]This is like getting up in the morning when I was living in Massachusetts.
[91:38.81]You go to your car and you clear your car off with snow and it just looks like this.
[91:43.25]You turn the car on and you just sit in the fucking driver's seat.
[91:46.07]And this is the view you get.
[91:50.21]Oh, I guess I'll make sure to plan an extra 35 minutes before I can drive the car.
[91:57.70]This is ridiculous.
[92:00.10]I mean, at what point do you just... I die.
[92:03.94]Do I not die?
[92:04.64]There's still a little bit.
[92:09.14]I can see how that... Okay.
[92:15.94]This is going to be really, really annoying.
[92:26.43]This is going to suck.
[92:28.69]You know that traffic game?
[92:31.27]Those of you that didn't see the last stream of this game months ago.
[92:35.41]It's that traffic game where you have to move, move, move, move, and then get the one car to the left all the way over.
[92:41.10]Is it called gridlock?
[92:42.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[92:43.42]It's stupid.
[92:55.42]Called rush hour, yeah.
[92:56.30]Alright, we gotta go from the back.
[92:59.96]Let him monologue for a second, it's okay.
[93:05.39]So.
[93:06.99]This one's gotta move.
[93:09.15]To the right.
[93:10.55]So this has gotta move up.
[93:11.99]To move this one up, this one has to move up.
[93:15.31]To move that one up, these two need to move all the way over.
[93:19.97]This needs to move all the way over.
[93:25.18]So to do that, this needs to move up.
[93:59.47]What do you mean?
[93:59.87]This is right?
[94:00.21]I have to move- I think this thing has to get the hell out of the way.
[94:04.69]This moves all the way over.
[94:22.30]There's a reason why you can't just push and hold, dude.
[94:26.13]You can't just push and hold.
[94:36.61]Come on, hurry up.
[94:38.09]I almost got it.
[94:46.34]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[94:53.32]Push it.
[94:53.78]Fucking hurry.
[94:56.75]I'm trying.
[95:06.58]Fucking hurry.
[95:07.24]I'm hurrying.
[95:08.10]Come on.
[95:17.28]Come on.
[95:17.52]That's it.
[95:17.94]That's it.
[95:18.24]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[95:24.61]Okay.
[95:25.03]Get in.
[95:26.95]Oh, to the heat.
[95:30.91]Why are you guys doing question?
[95:32.03]You guys are question marking me at the beginning.
[95:33.67]That's the only way I was going to be able to move them all.
[95:41.37]He sounds drunk.
[95:52.26]I guess he's probably just been sitting there drinking whiskey.
[95:56.48]What if he just like falls asleep?
[95:57.94]I can probably just walk through all the traps.
[96:03.28]It's been in game, in universe, it's been probably like seven hours in here.
[96:08.10]This dude's probably blasted.
[96:14.58]This way till he falls asleep.
[96:22.63]I got one.
[96:24.59]I gotta get number two.
[96:25.55]Number two is in the staff housing room.
[96:32.02]Now where the hell is that?
[96:39.03]The freezer.
[96:45.79]My lighter back.
[96:49.91]A staff room.
[96:50.83]Objectively, you see a circle?
[96:58.11]None of these are even marked.
[96:59.99]Yeah, the dude is sloshed.
[97:17.58]In the next room, you will find two, uh, three keys.
[97:24.05]Inside of, wait, no, in the vase, in the room behind you, there's a vase.
[97:29.49]Inside of that vase, there's two keys.
[97:31.64]I think, I don't, I think, you'll figure it out, I think.
[97:34.80]Call me when you figure it out.
[97:37.34]Make a choice.
[97:38.30]Okay.
[97:49.59]Ooh, I got a gas trap.
[97:50.43]What's that sound?
[98:04.47]I feel like the staff room was back here, all the way back here.
[98:08.28]Guys, I thought there was like 30 minutes left of this game.
[98:10.20]There's like two and a half hours left.
[98:12.82]Actually, I would blame the first hour of this transitioning to here.
[98:18.46]On the stupid puzzle thing that I got stuck on.
[98:20.77]The seven and a half minute room.
[98:21.81]Seven minutes room.
[98:22.35]Am I going the wrong way?
[98:27.51]Look for the staff room.
[98:31.58]Whoa.
[98:31.82]Don't kill me.
[98:45.96]I feel the same way when I... You idiot.
[98:54.52]Laugh at the streamer.
[98:55.16]All right.
[99:04.22]Staff room.
[99:06.96]What does it say?
[99:07.90]Cafeteria is that way.
[99:11.02]Security is that way.
[99:12.00]I think we have to go all the way back.
[99:24.31]Staff housing, I was right.
[99:26.71]I was right.
[99:33.34]Yeah, checkpoint, yeah.
[99:36.46]Hello?
[99:43.14]Oh shit, both of our heads are gonna explode.
[99:55.54]Pretty good.
[99:55.98]I'm utilizing the traps.
[100:08.58]Here we go, I'm gonna touch it.
[100:16.37]You know the sound that it makes when you take a picture with a disposable flash camera?
[100:21.19]That's what that is.
[100:22.67]That's an industry secret.
[100:26.02]I want to let you guys in on it.
[100:26.92]That didn't do it that time.
[100:33.32]But the one where it goes... You guys know the one.
[100:39.36]To the left or the right, down each path is the light.
[100:50.45]Put your name in the light.
[100:52.05]No, put your faith in the light.
[100:53.19]It's not a name.
[100:53.91]How would that matter?
[100:57.27]I can't put your name in the light.
[100:58.73]I can't see.
[100:59.47]Ooh, a jigsaw chest.
[101:05.71]Let's open it.
[101:20.34]Gas trap and ammonia.
[101:21.50]If I even open those, it's fucking useless.
[101:31.39]Does anybody know anything about Saw 2?
[101:34.68]Saw 2, as much of a train wreck as this game is.
[101:45.47]Actually, yes.
[101:58.59]Oh, I'm hungry.
[102:00.37]Oh, man.
[102:00.93]What are we doing for food today, boys and girls?
[102:02.75]What are we doing for food?
[102:03.39]Taco Bell?
[102:13.19]Nah, no thanks.
[102:17.24]Boys, I need a fucking circuit box.
[102:18.62]I'm almost swearing.
[102:19.28]I told my mother I wasn't going to do that anymore.
[102:27.98]There we are.
[102:40.29]Mm-hmm.
[102:41.07]Funnest puzzle in the games.
[102:43.83]This app is just lovely.
[102:46.26]That wasn't too bad.
[103:05.00]Not from my big brain.
[103:13.92]Red Lobster?
[103:16.58]No, I'd rather be able to hold in whatever goes down and not have it come up immediately about 30 minutes later.
[103:21.73]Did I say that?
[103:23.25]My opinion.
[103:39.00]That's how I feel.
[103:39.40]That's my personal opinion on the matter.
[103:40.60]Done.
[103:49.91]Oh, but what about those cheddar biscuits?
[103:54.41]Okay, yeah, go to go to a restaurant and order bread for food Just get bread just eat bread for the fucking appetizer for the main course desserts eat the bread eat cheddar biscuit bread
[104:17.26]I don't even order the lobster.
[104:18.26]Why would you?
[104:18.72]Just eat those.
[104:19.48]Oh, those cheddar biscuits.
[104:22.58]Oh, no.
[104:23.24]It's not armed.
[104:28.33]Am I walking on glass?
[104:36.61]Why is it already... But those cheddar biscuits, though.
[104:45.56]Right?
[104:55.27]Hey, don't tell anybody.
[104:56.82]Sometimes, I go to Red Lobster, and I order those cheddar biscuits.
[105:01.02]Oh, the cheddar biscuits.
[105:02.76]I get them, and I like, yeah, can we get two of these?
[105:05.52]And they bring more of them.
[105:06.86]I put like two in my pocket.
[105:08.44]They're so good.
[105:09.56]And I eat them later on when I get home.
[105:11.08]No, you don't.
[105:16.15]Nobody does that.
[105:17.03]Stop pretending you do that.
[105:21.29]Why do people have to pretend to like food?
[105:23.90]Just eat it.
[105:24.52]Who cares?
[105:24.96]I know.
[105:25.32]It's good.
[105:25.62]It's probably good.
[105:26.16]Just eat it.
[105:26.90]You don't have to, like, pretend like it's cool.
[105:31.14]God, we're so much different than everybody else.
[105:49.53]We're quirky.
[105:51.72]I can't say that word.
[105:52.44]People get really pissed off when I say that word.
[106:04.75]Hey, what's a food brag that you guys have?
[106:06.83]That's what I'm referring to.
[106:09.65]I'm trying to think of this as a food brag.

[115:23.48]I need to put it back?
[115:24.14]You're hearing it before or you're hearing it after?
[115:27.02]Good?

[117:00.20]Fuck you.
[117:23.02]We're okay.
[117:24.80]Nothing happened.
[117:26.94]It was just a little dangerous, that's all.
[117:28.58]Alright, what was in here?
[117:29.54]This guy?
[117:30.46]Another camera.
[117:33.74]Great.
[117:34.54]Delete it from the game.
[117:47.13]This is a long, elaborate, shitty thing to be doing.
[117:51.99]Right?
[117:52.17]Can I just get the key already?
[117:55.75]Or the light bulb?
[117:56.27]Whatever the hell you want me to do?
[117:57.90]Wait, I have both light bulbs.
[118:00.56]Oh shit, I have both light bulbs.
[118:10.98]Alright, so now... Turn to the theater control room with the two light bulbs.

[118:50.37]He's been doing cocaine in the bathroom.
[118:54.50]for the last three days.
[118:56.82]Good luck.
[119:08.53]He's been drinking coffee and doing cocaine all morning.
[119:20.04]Ooh, violent cabinet.
[119:28.65]Wait, I was just in the theater.
[119:34.01]You thought that was in the game?
[119:35.19]No, you did not.

[120:43.62]One.
[120:44.22]Oof.

[121:06.18]9-5-1.
[121:18.29]What?
[121:20.47]How's that wrong?
[121:21.17]What did I... The other way?

[122:23.50]What are you talking about? 612?
[122:42.76]6, 2, 1?
[122:48.40]Oh, look at it again.

[123:35.86]Red, green, blue.
[123:38.88]Does it have to be a certain color or anything?
[123:42.64]What?
[123:42.98]Red, green, blue?
[123:43.81]Alright, remember these numbers.
[123:45.91]This is 8.

[124:56.86]Wasn't the last one like 1-3-8?
[125:05.90]Alright.
[125:14.05]Let's see the climax of the movie.

[125:20.47]Here comes the movie's climax.
[125:34.08]Okay, Jeff.
[125:35.36]I'm here for you.
[125:40.83]He's going to get crushed if I don't hurry up.
[125:46.43]What?
[125:46.63]Why does he have this many TVs?
[125:47.81]Catch the symbols?
[126:27.08]What?

[127:38.14]Gun.
[127:38.42]Bullets.

[128:02.46]Okay.
[128:07.00]Tape.
[128:08.15]Tape.

[128:12.19]We're good.
[128:12.57]This is it.
[128:12.89]He's going to be fine.
[128:15.83]Saw.

[128:30.49]Dead.
[128:31.45]He's free.
[128:45.98]Yeah.
[128:46.28]Sorry, dude.
[128:46.70]You got to give me something harder than back of a cereal box like Captain Crunch.
[128:54.23]Detective!
[128:55.29]The one who... Are you here to harass me some more?
[128:58.53]To interrogate me?
[129:00.43]That looked painful.
[129:03.17]Are you bleeding?
[129:04.61]What do you care?
[129:05.61]You gonna ask me what he looks like again, you shit?
[129:08.91]I don't want you bleeding to death.
[129:10.86]Yeah, sure.
[129:12.82]You just want to know his face?
[129:14.16]Well, I didn't see him this time either, so... Don't worry, Jeff.
[129:17.68]I got this son of a bitch.
[129:19.44]I have evidence.
[129:20.52]We can beat him.
[129:27.50]All right, I got, I got, I'm good.
[129:28.64]Here we go.
[129:56.94]Locate the entrance to the library.
[129:58.42]More of this bullshit?
[130:02.15]Oh, double peg fight.
[130:12.15]An infinite game.
[130:14.33]What do you see when you imagine me, detective?
[130:17.50]A masked vigilante.
[130:19.40]An obsessed psychopath.
[130:30.75]You see, I live in the Antarctic.
[130:40.53]You live in Las Vegas.
[130:42.51]Two very, very separate climates.
[130:44.57]But sometimes I have visions of being on a nice sunny beach
[130:58.37]Great actor?
[131:06.24]Oh, thanks, man!
[131:12.89]Where is this person?
[131:16.17]How do I get out of here?
[131:18.53]No one said that.
[131:19.45]Yes, they did.
[131:21.62]Can you guys tell what my face looks like when I'm doing this?
[131:23.94]My teeth.
[131:25.10]My face is scrunched up.
[131:26.06]My teeth are out.
[131:29.50]You ruined my life.
[131:39.04]You ruined my life.
[131:48.43]Then back it.
[131:49.19]Okay.
[131:57.98]How did I ruin your life?
[131:59.26]Is he telling people I did this?
[132:00.54]I think the guy that stuck the VR goggles deep into your eye sockets is the one that probably ruined your life.
[132:16.11]I didn't do that.
[132:27.86]Why did you do that?
[132:28.82]Why did you do this?
[132:33.27]He's locked back there.
[132:34.01]We're fine.
[132:45.35]I can hear him.
[132:47.80]How can I hear him talking?
[132:49.08]Hiro.
[133:01.84]That was just give me the fucking key.
[133:07.66]Give me the fucking key.
[133:11.53]Keep looking.
[133:12.43]Okay, fine.
[133:14.51]I don't want to keep looking.
[133:25.82]Locate the entrance to the library.
[133:27.38]Yeah.
[133:33.94]Guilty.
[133:34.34]Where am I?
[133:35.98]All right.
[133:36.22]I got to go.
[133:43.66]Sorry, dude.
[133:44.24]I couldn't.
[133:44.72]What am I supposed to let you out?
[133:51.30]Hang right.
[133:55.91]Then, fuck.
[134:01.49]Actual murderer.
[134:02.37]I did not murder that guy.
[134:05.69]He had a device on his head that I did not put on him.
[134:08.03]And I don't know how to open the door.
[134:11.75]Sorry I murdered this guy in here.
[134:13.87]I killed that guy.
[134:15.99]I tied him up and put Home Depot saw blades behind his head.
[134:19.49]And gave him a timer before it grinded his head into pulp.
[134:22.89]I mean, I did that.
[134:24.69]I must have done that.
[134:39.63]You're almost there.
[134:42.51]One is in the library.
[134:46.47]We're at the climax of the game.
[134:47.93]You're going to arrest yourself.
[134:55.52]It's going to be something stupid.
[134:56.76]You know it is already.
[134:57.62]We're going to find out how bad of a guy I am.
[135:07.09]I'm a really bad guy, right?
[135:08.59]I did horrible things.
[135:09.65]I'm going to be somebody that comes out and is like, I'm the bad guy.
[135:14.99]I'll be a bad guy somehow.
[135:19.55]I arrested Saw back... This whole thing is... When I was 16, I was on a roof at my friend's house and I pulled up a few shingles.
[135:31.36]I then threw the shingles off the roof.
[135:33.82]I called the police and you came and got me and put me in a juvenile hall.
[135:38.51]This is payback for when you arrested me, detective.
[135:47.94]You think Jigsaw made that graffiti?
[135:57.00]Apparently he does everything.
[136:01.05]Why don't we... Why don't somebody... Let's arrest Jigsaw and make him a game designer.
[136:07.59]Like, dude, hey, how about you, like, stop this kind of murdering shit and make us, like, a new Call of Duty?
[136:18.75]What an elaborate setup you have here.
[136:20.24]This is, like, designed very well.
[136:27.24]Blocked, blocked, blocked, blocked.
[136:28.60]Everything's blocked.
[136:29.20]Everything's blocked, blocked, blocked, blocked.
[136:30.40]Can I play this?
[136:38.55]Nope.
[136:41.57]A lot of shit in here.
[136:48.58]Okay, let's go.
[136:56.08]Now what?
[136:57.88]I went across there.
[136:58.72]Hang a right and then a left.
[137:05.19]Or you know what I mean.
[137:12.70]list for saw isn't the whole thing with saw the reason why oh he does everything is because and they're like eight of them it's like eight different saws there's like a saw team like the wizard of oz you know there's just the guy with his face is there but then like all the munchkins do all the work saw con right
[137:43.36]Okay, so what the fuck was the point of that?
[137:44.60]I just saw you down there.
[137:47.46]Can I jump down here?
[137:48.72]No.
[137:57.19]Offices.
[137:58.19]Go to the library.
[138:00.37]I can't even go over here, though.
[138:02.67]This shit's blocked off.
[138:03.47]Is there another way I can go?
[138:12.57]Get me back down to where that lady was.
[138:14.96]Oh shit, I just spoiled the whole movie.
[138:16.82]Whoops.
[138:17.24]I spoiled Saw.
[138:19.24]I told you there was going to be Saw spoils.
[138:28.92]Okay, look, if you haven't seen Saw 1 and 2 already, are you really going to sit there and watch all seven of them?
[138:36.77]No, you probably don't even care.
[138:38.03]This is probably the only experience you have with Saw.
[138:40.49]And you're like, this is all I ever want.
[138:42.49]I gotta go back down.
[138:58.63]Somebody quick, link the rat falling and landing on his head.
[139:04.25]You deserve that.
[139:05.65]Where's the last checkpoint?
[139:07.13]Fuck, man.
[139:08.37]I just need to go to the library and the game ends.
[139:10.80]You are almost there, detective.
[139:13.36]What you have been seeing is in the library.
[139:21.68]Yes, let's deactivate that cutscene again.
[139:29.47]Nothing even in here.
[139:30.13]Who gives a shit?
[139:30.87]Fuck off.
[139:31.21]For fuck's sake, come on.
[139:49.72]They made a game about the movie?
[139:51.10]I really don't... I don't know what the hell this is supposed to be, but sure.
[139:55.38]Wait a minute.
[139:55.74]Should I go down here?
[140:03.15]Well, now I know how the cat died.
[140:04.46]That's a huge cat, by the way.
[140:10.82]That cat is almost as big as me.
[140:17.91]That's a tiger.
[140:18.69]Mhm.
[140:27.25]In the library, sure.
[140:28.53]Let's go to the library.
[140:34.02]That's three in a row real quick.
[140:35.46]We gotta get him out of the way.
[140:47.33]He's taunting me.
[140:48.88]I know how close I am.
[140:53.30]I s- I tried to go.

[141:22.86]I'm not gonna die again.
[141:24.04]Oh
[141:39.57]It sounded like a Snapple opening.
[141:40.95]I haven't had a Snapple in probably 20 years.
[141:43.81]Do you still make Snapple?
[141:56.78]Snapple is gross.
[141:57.78]I haven't had it in almost 20 years.
[141:59.49]I don't know if it's gross.
[142:00.85]No, it might be.
[142:01.29]It could be.
[142:10.03]Alright, let's get the cutscene to play, and then I'm done with this shit.
[142:19.91]Yeah, you're down there making stuff.
[142:22.98]Uh-huh.
[142:26.58]Great.

[143:23.23]I'm trying, dude.
[143:24.47]I'm trying to do this fast again.
[143:25.55]I just gotta run as fast.

[143:59.02]Can't go that way.
[143:59.78]Can't go this way either.

[144:09.16]Pepe left.
[144:13.38]I know that I am.
[144:15.96]I played this game for like six and a half hours.
[144:18.28]Or like two and a half hours ago when I changed.
[144:20.50]The cracked wall.
[144:28.63]The cracked wall.
[144:34.01]Whole crack, whole crack, whole crack.
[144:37.53]Crack time, crack time, crack time, crack time.
[144:45.06]Is there a crack?
[144:50.38]Up top?
[144:50.74]Back up top?
[144:53.12]Back up top, right?
[145:05.51]Not up top, or is it down here?
[145:06.65]There's a crack in the room with the cutscene.
[145:11.35]Oh.
[145:18.01]Is it really?
[145:21.15]Are you kidding me?
[145:26.51]Oh right, I forgot this was game mechanic.
[145:28.59]Sorry guys, it's been three and a half months.

[146:01.64]Okay, we're golden.
[146:04.24]Do tape.
[146:04.60]Final gauntlet.
[146:23.95]Let's go.
[146:35.43]Uh oh.
[146:39.04]Final boss incoming.
[146:44.60]Dude, climb up the wall.
[146:50.29]We have to do that to them.
[146:57.49]I don't know why that's supposed to shock me at this point.
[147:00.05]We've seen some really awful shit.
[147:02.77]It's not a big deal.
[147:04.13]In fact, that's underwhelming.
[147:05.39]What's your final thing?
[147:14.28]Look, I have electricity on the ground.
[147:18.00]We've been doing that for like the last 12 hours, dude.
[147:19.65]It's not a big deal.
[147:21.19]Oh!
[147:40.62]Oh, somebody's attacking me.
[147:42.96]I didn't even know.
[147:43.46]Is this the gauntlet?
[147:47.76]Am I in the final gauntlet right now?
[147:49.18]I feel like I'm not, but I feel like I should be.
[147:51.00]Am I in the final gauntlet?
[148:01.22]He controlled that one.
[148:02.26]He pressed the button on that one.
[148:11.24]No, I wanna open the door.
[148:18.14]The final gauntlet.
[148:21.59]It's actually a final, it's actually a boss.
[148:25.89]Oh, it's not an instant kill.
[148:35.62]Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[148:46.39]Wait, just... Do it again.
[148:54.60]Come on.
[148:57.38]How many shotgun shells do I have?
[149:10.91]Is it armed?
[149:14.90]Oh shit, it's not armed.
[149:18.41]Oh, shit, he's fast.
[149:24.06]Lock it on him.
[149:24.48]Lock it.
[149:24.78]Lock it.
[149:30.38]Oh, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
[149:33.26]He doesn't squeeze through, does he?
[149:38.03]Okay.
[149:49.28]Did you stay there?
[149:49.80]Uh... Alright, hang tight.
[150:07.66]I'm gonna get some supplies.
[150:10.12]Rock on shell, good.
[150:13.98]Rip wire, I need that.
[150:19.91]Nail.
[150:20.39]Good.
[150:24.26]What's he got?
[150:26.40]Oh, nice.
[150:28.72]Free shit.
[150:33.88]Health.
[150:36.79]Gear.
[150:38.47]He's just standing there.
[150:39.37]Yeah, that's fine.
[150:42.59]Alright, I guess I can do another tripwire.
[150:44.25]How am I going to get by him?
[150:50.54]Definitely get this thing.
[150:51.26]This thing's way better.
[151:02.81]Yeah, nail bad.
[151:03.73]Let's go.
[151:12.48]Is he softlocked?
[151:13.36]No, I'm not softlocked.
[151:14.30]Look.
[151:21.53]Okay.
[151:21.81]Now... How do I use these?
[151:28.09]Explosive trap.
[151:30.09]How do I... Anybody know how to use these?
[151:31.43]What button do I press?
[151:46.79]Right bumper and then B?
[151:59.95]Dude, I could totally get a fucking selfie of this guy.
[152:04.45]And people would be like, how did you get so close to the pig man?
[152:08.55]Bang.
[152:09.13]Right there.
[152:09.77]Got you.
[152:10.49]That's going on Instagram.
[152:11.93]It's gonna get fucking 500 million likes.
[152:23.80]What?
[152:25.62]Did you... It took you that long to duck?
[152:33.07]Holy shit, he almost... Go back in, go back in, go back in.
[152:39.75]Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
[152:41.13]He's way stronger.
[152:41.85]That could be right in the back of the head.
[152:47.89]Alright, so R, B, and then B?
[152:58.37]R, B, B to use.
[153:00.57]Is that what you're saying?
[153:10.13]Okay, explosive trap.
[153:15.17]It's not B. That's not right.
[153:19.96]That's incorrect.
[153:23.50]R, B, B.
[153:43.08]Just keep going, keep going.
[153:45.38]He's going to get electrocuted.
[153:46.50]He's going to do the thing the dog does when the dog doesn't know where you are and runs the other way and you catch the dog.
[153:56.07]By the way, did Jigsaw just say, electrocute me?
[153:59.71]He doesn't like that.
[154:00.46]He hates that.
[154:01.68]He doesn't like being electrocuted.
[154:07.72]What?
[154:08.30]What is this mechanic?
[154:17.49]I have no idea what I even did.
[154:18.41]Oh, open that shit!
[154:29.93]Okay, just juice him!
[154:41.82]That was so anticlimactic.
[154:43.66]I actually got him.
[154:44.52]Alright, can we unmask him?
[154:47.25]Take the mask off and see who it is.
[154:48.47]I see... Oh, guys.
[154:58.34]I see a five-minute timer in there.
[155:09.79]I don't want a five-minute timer for a pipe dream mission.
[155:16.29]Please, no.
[155:17.81]Please, no.
[155:18.53]Have it be anything else.
[155:19.35]I'll do anything else.
[155:21.73]But not just the connect the pipe pipe dream thing.
[155:27.00]Alright, let's go.
[155:27.72]I'm stalling long enough.
[155:34.40]He made these levels.
[155:35.24]That's how you respond.
[155:36.14]Yeah.
[155:37.66]You know, I changed my mind.
[155:38.52]He shouldn't be a game dev.
[155:40.32]He's repeating the same level over and over again.
[155:42.34]Repeating the same puzzle over and over again.
[156:03.70]Too late.
[156:05.90]That's fine.
[156:06.28]I don't care.
[156:09.18]Thank God it was the wrong way.
[156:10.12]Here comes the climax.
[156:17.61]What happens in the end of Saw?
[156:21.90]My final choice.
[156:48.61]This is before I gas you I'm not even gonna give you the choice you just died detective.
[156:54.04]Oh
[157:21.04]Oh, he figured it out.
[157:22.66]Oh, no.
[157:25.84]I hope I get to baseball bat this guy in the head.
[157:28.75]And look, it's going to be, see, it wasn't even Saw.
[157:30.71]It was somebody else tied up to the chair.
[157:39.81]Ruth.
[157:42.63]Freedom.
[157:49.04]Dare.
[157:49.28]Dare.
[157:55.43]Truth or freedom?
[158:05.02]Which door?
[158:10.74]Okay, so I either can know the truth and die or leave.
[158:17.59]Just come out of like a subway station somewhere.
[158:25.86]Save the game?
[158:26.58]I can't.
[158:31.78]We're going to do truth.
[158:36.52]Do a poll?
[158:38.29]Alright, fine.
[158:38.69]Let's see what the people think.
[158:43.49]I'll see what the people think.
[158:44.23]I mean, am I going to use this?
[158:48.15]Unless this confirms my own assumptions on you.
[158:55.90]Freedom is probably just going to be an ending cutscene where you walk out with like sun going in your eyes and it's really bright and you go, oh shit.
[159:06.71]Here we go.
[159:14.79]Through the freedom.
[159:25.20]I don't think the pole doesn't even need to be open for any longer.
[159:28.32]There's a third door behind you.
[159:30.62]That's the door I came in.
[159:31.38]Wait.
[159:31.62]What door is this?
[159:39.93]This is the third door.
[159:46.17]It's a secret door.
[160:03.25]Behind you in the atrium are two doors.
[160:20.82]A door to truth and a door to freedom.
[160:24.85]This is the last choice you'll have to make.
[160:27.23]But to make your choice, Detective Tapp, you will need to retreat.
[160:37.46]Oh no, it's gonna be like- Oh, great.
[160:40.98]Can't wait for the puzzles.
[160:42.14]Locate the key for the choice door as we- as we were supposed to go through here.
[160:47.43]Hurry!
[160:49.75]Okay, now what?
[160:55.11]Where?
[160:55.31]The hell do you want me to do?
[161:01.82]Right.
[161:02.89]In ten minutes.
[161:03.95]Dude, don't give me a gauntlet of stupid fucking puzzles.
[161:17.17]What?
[161:19.43]Well, I don't care.
[161:20.25]I just wanna... Who's that guy?
[161:25.56]Oh, some dick.
[161:41.10]It's just a maze.
[161:42.16]Okay, this way, and then... I climb... Stupid gauntlet.
[161:55.96]There's nothing even down here, is there?
[161:57.12]Oh, great.
[161:58.44]I just wasted, like, fucking a full straight minute.
[162:00.78]That's fantastic.
[162:01.67]I can't go anywhere else.
[162:23.47]No reason at all.
[162:25.65]It has to be.
[162:34.16]Heal, please.
[162:35.64]Heal.
[162:36.06]Heal in here.
[162:37.95]Heal.
[162:39.21]Heal.
[162:40.59]You can't get away from me.
[162:41.79]Heal.
[162:42.51]Why is it not healing?
[162:43.73]X to heal.
[162:46.25]Can't heal.
[162:46.53]Do I not have any more heals?
[162:54.47]I don't have any heals.
[163:11.37]Stop.
[163:17.65]Oh shit, I'm about to go in.
[163:21.99]Um, I need to heal.
[163:24.21]Heal something?
[163:24.95]I need to... Oh, god damn it.
[163:27.35]Oh, god damn it.
[163:28.07]Oh, god damn it.
[163:28.63]God damn it.
[163:29.01]God damn it.
[163:29.33]God damn it.
[163:29.65]God damn it.
[163:29.99]Get ready.
[163:30.39]Here he comes.
[163:30.85]One, two... He's gonna throw one!
[163:32.49]I thought I hit a knife.
[163:51.81]You dumbass.
[163:52.99]But, it's okay.
[163:56.55]Holy shit!
[163:58.93]Don't throw it!
[163:59.33]Don't throw it!
[163:59.69]Don't throw it!
[164:00.03]Don't throw it!
[164:00.37]Don't throw it!
[164:02.57]Don't throw it!
[164:13.02]In the molotovs.
[164:13.68]I need those.
[164:16.32]Okay, now.
[164:17.44]Is there a button I can press?
[164:18.50]Is there something I can do in here?
[164:20.96]I'm gonna throw molotovs at this guy over here.
[164:28.65]Really?
[164:30.63]And... I don't have any left?
[164:57.37]Do I have to kill everybody?
[165:02.19]What's this final gauntlet bullshit?
[165:05.34]Who wants to do a final gauntlet?
[165:08.42]This place is so great.
[165:09.56]I can't even tell where the hell I'm going.
[165:11.94]Fucking hurry.
[165:19.17]I'm going as fast as I can, man.
[165:33.11]Is it just open?
[165:41.52]I can just leave, you said.
[165:42.93]I can just leave.
[165:43.53]Where's the door to get out of here?
[165:45.15]Oh, it's right there.
[165:45.65]Okay.
[165:46.01]Oh, shit.
[165:46.49]Okay, I know, I know, I know.
[165:47.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[165:47.57]I didn't know I could just leave.
[165:48.73]I didn't know I could just leave.
[165:49.83]You're right.
[165:50.13]I can leave.
[165:50.37]I can just leave.
[165:50.76]Alright, get the fuck out of here.
[165:57.25]What?
[165:57.87]Oh shit, man.
[165:58.79]This is making me want to fucking throw up in my hands and then wash my face with my fucking puke-covered hands.
[166:06.90]Oh, god damn it!
[166:24.26]Just kill me.
[166:24.88]I've started.
[166:25.68]I went the wrong way.
[166:33.59]I can't do that?
[166:34.51]How did you even get up here, man?
[166:42.07]Okay, I kind of feel bad for that guy.
[166:44.07]That guy actually was my friend.
[166:45.57]I think that guy was helping me.
[166:47.87]Kind of, right?
[166:48.43]I think he kind of was.
[166:50.87]Alright, I'm just going to go through the building and walk out of this stupid... I hate this area.
[167:11.20]Open Okay, so I just have to go to the right No, I gotta go up but the best way to go up is to go can I go down and then up?
[167:24.20]Yeah, let's go I'm gonna help him
[167:37.89]Alright, we just double teamed him.
[167:55.12]Did you go back to Ratatouille?
[167:56.28]No.
[167:57.14]It's too late for that.
[168:06.29]All right, we can just leave.
[168:12.91]I have to kill everyone?
[168:21.70]Quick, detective.
[168:22.34]Okay, wait, where's the exit?
[168:24.58]Right there.
[168:25.16]All right, I can just leave.
[168:26.16]Oh, my fucking God, man.
[168:50.90]What, his cap is on backwards?
[168:54.14]Stop.
[168:55.32]Stop, stop, leave me alone.
[168:57.36]Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone.
[169:00.20]I got eight minutes.
[169:12.27]Wait, I went back to, he gave me ten, he gave me ten minutes?
[169:22.54]Why did I have 10 minutes to do that?
[169:25.52]Is he giving me extra time?
[169:34.65]We've heard the end of the Saw movie music a dozen times now.
[169:39.75]When is the real ending of this fucking game?
[169:46.64]Is it timed?
[169:48.90]What?
[169:58.07]What?
[169:58.43]What the fuck?
[169:59.01]What the fuck?
[169:59.47]What the fuck?
[169:59.89]What?
[170:00.13]What?
[170:00.35]There's no panel to turn this off.
[170:10.12]Flash.
[170:11.54]Flash.
[170:14.61]Flash.
[170:14.97]Okay, you gotta... Where do I go?
[170:16.71]Oh my god.
[170:18.83]Right through the...
[170:32.77]I know, okay, I see it now.
[170:36.60]I thought I had to time it.
[170:37.82]All right, everybody relax.
[170:41.38]Everybody relax, you're good.
[170:53.83]I gotta make this a little easier.
[170:55.11]He's having a lot of trouble.
[170:57.83]Is he okay?
[171:01.25]Detective.
[171:02.47]This is a really long time to do this shit.
[171:04.73]Yet I couldn't get...
[171:32.05]Like 10 minutes to do the stupid insane puzzle room?
[171:39.80]Why would it have taken me 10 straight minutes to do that?
[171:44.40]Final choice key.
[171:56.53]Return to the choice doors.
[171:59.45]It's 10 minutes again.
[172:04.50]Why was I on this ten minutes shit?
[172:14.50]Is there a valve in here?
[172:15.16]Come on, give me a valve.
[172:18.24]Come on.
[172:19.38]Bullshit.
[172:19.79]This is how you turn the gas off.
[172:21.93]Oh, who cares?
[172:22.59]Fuck the gas.
[172:23.09]Let's just run.
[172:33.53]This way?
[172:37.01]Alright, open this!
[172:44.30]There's the water.
[172:45.30]Yeah.
[173:08.70]He's actually so fucking done with this game.
[173:13.19]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[173:15.75]We have a winner.
[173:18.77]What have they won?
[173:19.79]Come on.
[173:31.39]This one right here?
[173:32.09]Nope.
[173:38.64]No.
[173:40.14]No.
[173:43.07]No.
[173:43.73]No.
[173:44.91]No.
[173:47.97]This whole thing is wrong.
[173:53.59]Was it?
[173:53.91]Get that gas off.
[174:09.51]Alright, gas is done.
[174:10.31]Now I can actually see what I'm doing.
[174:12.03]Plenty of time.
[174:29.83]Alright, I got seven and a half minutes to do this stupid puzzle.
[174:34.20]And it's a big one.
[174:35.96]It's a big one.
[174:39.45]Be easy here.
[174:47.76]It's a monster one.
[174:56.82]Fuck.
[174:57.84]Hold on.
[174:58.12]Slow down.
[174:58.54]I got plenty of time.
[175:09.90]Outside in, outside in.
[175:10.96]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[175:12.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[175:36.27]Uh... Uh...
[175:47.24]Uh... Okay.
[175:49.64]Okay.
[175:54.37]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[175:56.15]Okay.
[176:01.39]Okay.
[176:10.28]What do I do with this?
[176:15.46]It has to connect to either this one or this one.
[176:17.98]It has to connect to this.
[176:18.94]Has to.
[176:26.69]Oh, shit!
[176:27.59]Come on, dude!
[176:28.51]No!
[176:30.73]No!
[176:33.95]No!
[176:34.46]Why?
[176:34.82]Oh, man.
[176:41.74]I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[176:44.96]We're done.
[176:45.36]We're done.
[176:54.21]The timer's still going.
[176:58.93]Why is the timer still going?
[176:59.75]How come he didn't reset it on me this time?
[177:10.95]Hurry.
[177:13.61]Hurry, um... I'm going.
[177:18.08]Did I do it?
[177:22.34]Yes!
[177:23.12]Okay, I got it.
[177:23.68]Thank God.
[177:27.04]It's time to choose, and you guys chose truth.
[177:29.52]This is what has been decided.
[177:36.23]I think I killed everybody.
[177:38.49]I think I killed everybody.
[178:07.70]I really hope truth does not add a chapter to the game.
[178:11.48]Freedom or truth.
[178:12.70]Going truth.
[178:17.78]Voice has been made.
[178:22.58]Okay, that's what the truth room looks like.
[178:23.98]Alright, let's see what the freedom one looks like.
[178:28.48]Just see.
[178:31.03]I can't, okay, I can't take it out.
[178:41.18]Let's add another chapter to the game.
[178:43.16]Find the truth.
[178:44.54]God damn it, you added a chapter!
[178:47.06]No! ...
[179:11.57]I just want to see the end.
[179:12.73]It's too late.
[179:16.43]I just got a checkpoint.
[179:17.35]It's too late.
[179:30.68]Time for the- Guilty.
[179:40.61]I wasn't even looking.
[179:50.96]Jigsaw on a little tricycle.
[179:52.74]Doesn't anybody wish that it kind of was just like that little guy on the tricycle?
[179:59.70]And not just a guy.
[180:14.57]It isn't?
[180:17.31]No, technically no.
[180:22.95]Chase him!
[180:24.23]He's so slow, get him!
[180:26.99]He's so slow, we can keep up.
[180:30.65]Wait.
[180:39.22]He's so slow guys, don't worry.
[180:40.86]Sewing kit, telephone.
[180:46.10]Maybe a health potion or something.
[180:50.88]White shadowy figure.
[180:55.85]I feel like I'm gonna hit him once and he's gonna die.
[181:02.79]This is him.
[181:15.40]He took his fucking shirt off and just went rage mode.
[181:19.30]Just kind of a big fat guy with no clothes on.
[181:22.13]This weapon sucks.
[181:34.30]Why is this guy, the final battle, is people still just down here?
[181:37.82]That had to have been Jigsaw.
[181:44.84]Alright, hopefully I get a good weapon out of this.
[181:58.79]That was Big Saw.
[182:07.18]Kill Jigsaw.
[182:10.12]Where is he?
[182:15.30]He's holding the door?
[182:19.67]Got it.
[183:26.66]What is that?
[183:32.08]Oh shit.
[183:32.99]You should have paid attention, dude.
[183:35.95]You got killed by a double trap.
[183:52.06]I don't have any sympathy at all for her at all.
[183:55.30]Not at all.
[183:56.48]The amount of times that I have gotten killed by that shotgun trap, I kind of have to expect it by now.
[184:03.29]You don't open the final door and not look.
[184:13.41]What am I doing?
[184:30.78]Pizza.
[184:31.08]Again.
[184:34.46]Should have done freedom.
[184:44.95]Hey, we made our choice.
[184:55.76]Break the disc.
[184:57.50]No, now we can play Saw 2.
[184:59.38]In like four months.
[185:06.77]It was alright.
[185:07.65]I did say that I hated the game.
[185:08.99]I thought it was awful.
[185:09.75]I thought it was the worst game I've ever streamed, right?
[185:11.82]I said that?
[185:19.22]I think I said this is the worst game I've ever streamed.
[185:21.88]That's kind of harsh, I think.
[185:22.88]Let's do freedom.
[185:31.95]Wait.
[185:33.33]I can't.
[185:37.81]It'll be 7-14.
[185:38.13]It's probably right behind the door.
[185:45.99]Yeah, right.
[185:49.02]This is it.
[185:49.58]Right now.
[185:49.84]Let's go.
[185:51.14]This is good.
[185:51.82]Freedom.
[185:59.93]Earlier than this?
[186:12.71]I kind of want to know what it is.
[186:15.47]Perfect.
[186:16.97]Okay.
[186:17.29]Time for us to find out.
[186:22.99]What happens if you pick freedom?
[186:24.55]I just skipped it.
[186:31.61]All right, here we go.
[186:32.47]Freedom.
[186:42.05]What is this one?
[187:00.04]I'm still obsessed with it.
[187:01.12]I can't get over it.
[187:24.74]Uh, truth is... I think truth is probably a better ending than... Okay.
[187:41.35]Okay, I was trying to skip the credits.
[187:43.75]Oh, man.
[187:44.75]I was trying to skip the credits.
[187:45.91]I was trying to skip the credits.
[187:48.45]Holy...
[187:56.14]Holy shit, okay.
[187:57.10]Well, that was a little intense.
[187:58.48]I was trying- I was trying to- I was hitting A to skip the credits and that was intentional.
[188:03.03]I put that in there.
[188:04.73]That was Saw and that's the end of the stream.
[188:12.93]I'll see you tomorrow for Mafia.
[188:15.73]Gonna do the Mafia remake.
[188:18.51]If I'm still having fun, then we'll go back to it a little bit later on this week.
[188:24.20]That is tomorrow.
[188:27.52]Also, I'm going to be streaming on Wednesday night.
[188:29.42]I want to tell you now because it's going to be very, very late at night.
[188:34.37]We're playing a VR game.
[188:36.89]That's right.
[188:37.21]We're going back into VR.
[188:37.87]VR virtual reality is back as of Wednesday.
[188:45.85]We're playing multiplayer VR with a very special secret guest.
[188:49.95]And then after that, we'll do some more VR games next week.
[189:00.71]I leaked it already.
[189:01.65]Accidentally.
[189:02.37]I didn't know.
[189:02.89]I'm an idiot.
[189:09.97]That's going to be... That was a perfect six-hour stream.
[189:14.47]Wow.
[189:15.79]Right on time.
[189:20.88]Is the guest going to be Otto?
[189:22.68]Otto cannot be in a helmet like that.
[189:26.44]Can't put Otto with that.
[189:27.24]What are you talking about?
[189:31.00]So we'll see you tomorrow for Mafia, and then I'll see you for VR on Wednesday.
[189:35.06]And then FTK is this weekend.
[189:37.44]Pretty packed up schedule, I would say, this week.
[189:42.60]I will give more details on everything you need to know about FTK on probably Wednesday night.
[189:50.68]Good time, I think, to do it, to tell you everything you need to know.
[189:55.40]This week has been chock full of shit.
[190:00.83]But, uh, I will see you guys later.
[190:02.31]We're gonna do the credits.
[190:03.07]We'll hang out for a few minutes, a minute or so.
[190:07.63]Here they come.
[190:09.49]These are all the subs, all the resubs, all the gifted subs, community subs, everything for the stream today.
[190:15.12]Thanks a lot, guys.
[190:15.86]This stream has thousands and thousands of fucking subs.
[190:17.96]I still sometimes cannot believe that that many people would pay me money on a monthly basis.
[190:22.64]Some of you for years straight.
[190:25.54]Some of you have been giving money to the stream more than you've ever given Netflix.
[190:30.68]I can't even understand how.
[190:34.84]I missed a few of these.
[190:36.36]I do want to say thanks to FepperLikePepper for five community subs.
[190:44.25]SuperBruce for five subs.
[190:46.97]BreeDog for ten community subs I missed earlier.
[190:50.45]BasedBernie, thanks for five subs.
[190:56.24]Thanks a lot, guys.
[190:58.55]And I will tell you, I had a little of this stream, I... I, you know, I'm so like... I can't believe I couldn't beat that fucking level on Ratatouille.
[191:10.51]I don't know why, I have no idea what was going on there.
[191:13.19]I can't believe I didn't do it.
[191:19.04]I am so glad that I beat Saw on this stream.
[191:23.53]And I'm so glad I pulled myself out of the Ratatouille Matrix when I did.
[191:27.25]Otherwise, this would have been six hours of me failing at that Ratatouille level.
[191:33.84]God.
[191:36.10]I have to beat that.
[191:37.22]I did.
[191:37.58]I did in my mind like three times.
[191:45.92]This is my first stream.
[191:49.07]Well, I hope you had a good time.
[191:52.40]Thanks for stopping by.
[191:53.10]Maybe we'll see you again tomorrow or the next day or maybe some other time.
[191:59.37]New follower song.
[192:00.47]No, you've just sent a clip.
[192:04.47]Lots of X's I've noticed.
[192:06.85]Hey, you want to be, uh, you want to, you know, stand up from the crowd on Twitch?
[192:10.97]Have your name start with a Z. There's only like eight of you in this chat right now.
[192:20.72]Thanks for subbing everybody.
[192:25.04]See you tomorrow.
[192:26.54]Get some sleep.
[192:29.09]We can now actually play Saw 2 whenever I feel like it.
[192:33.45]Hopefully it's not going to be the second worst game I've ever streamed.
[192:39.79]Good night, guys.
[192:40.19]See you soon.
[193:02.72]you
[193:36.41]People are saying raid.
[193:37.23]Yeah, let's do a raid tonight.
[193:38.29]I was about to hit the button.
[193:41.19]Who's even live right now?
[193:50.45]Let's see.
[194:00.78]Nobody I'm following is even online.
[194:06.33]This is pretty rare.
[194:07.01]Oh, no.
[194:10.41]Wait a minute.
[194:10.91]Hold on.
[194:11.23]I had to refresh.
[194:11.81]Oh, let's raid.
[194:18.79]You know, let's go.
[194:24.92]Let's go.
[194:25.22]Let's go.
[194:26.34]I can't even say words.
[194:28.04]Let's raid Ludwig.
[194:33.26]Scream at him.
[194:35.52]playing Among Us.
[194:36.18]Let's go see if he fucking loses.
[194:43.23]Let's go see if he's a good imposter player.
[194:45.67]He's pretty good.
[194:52.75]Although I was talking about Among Us earlier.
[194:55.39]About how I'm never going to play it and you'll never see it on the stream.
[194:58.47]But let's go check it out.
[195:04.41]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[195:06.53]Have a nice night.
[195:07.71]Goodbye.
[195:08.51]Take care.
[195:09.43]Good night.
[195:09.79]See you later.
[195:11.36]Sweet.
[195:12.78]Now go say hello.
[195:15.02]Ludwig's a good dude.
[195:17.58]He's a swell lad.
[195:22.51]I'll see you later.
[196:06.05]Hold on.
[196:15.42]I'm sorry.
[196:15.84]We haven't gone yet.
[196:17.00]Where is this coming from?
[196:20.44]Why do I have... There's like a video playing in the background.
[196:27.80]Where?
[196:28.02]Hold on.
[196:30.32]I need to find this.
[196:31.76]Have I just been playing YouTube videos back to back to back to back?
[196:34.42]I swear to God, I don't know where this is coming from.
[196:39.19]I missed that.
[196:40.43]And I'm dead.
[196:41.21]Is this a stream?
[196:42.03]No, I'm not.
[196:42.66]I think a video has been playing the entire stream.
