[00:01.40]Good... Oh, I can't say good morning.
[00:04.64]I have to say good afternoon, Jeremiah.
[00:10.12]Yeah, I started an hour later today than usual.
[00:12.76]I have some stuff to do this morning.
[00:17.55]But I've completed all of my tasks and I'm ready to play a video game.
[00:21.45]In front of all of you.
[00:26.71]Today, we're going to be playing Eternal Darkness...
[00:33.32]Let's stop.
[00:34.68]Let's hold on a second.
[00:36.82]Hadn't even been one, two full minutes.
[00:39.93]I'm just gonna... We're not gonna do that yet.
[00:43.47]I promised my mother that I would at least be cordial and I wouldn't be like a weirdo for the first 40 minutes of the stream today.
[00:51.71]Sorry, Mom.
[00:55.25]Return of Dr. Sinity's Requiem.
[00:56.47]This game came out for GameCube.
[00:57.69]It's a GameCube classic.
[01:02.37]This game, uh, fucks with you while you play it.
[01:05.87]It's by Silicon Knights.
[01:07.83]You might know them as the people that sued, uh, Unreal Engine and they lost.
[01:14.21]Unfortunately, that's like the biggest thing they've done.
[01:18.82]Which is sad, because this game is really good.
[01:22.48]And I'm actually one of the weirdos that liked 2 Human.
[01:26.84]I liked that game.
[01:27.79]I thought Two Human was good.
[01:29.77]That was the last real video game they worked on.
[01:31.67]And then they had all this legal problems and then they stopped.
[01:38.41]Two Human was good.
[01:40.23]I liked it.
[01:41.85]Me and my brother used to sit there and play Two Human.
[01:44.71]Like three or four hours a day.
[01:47.13]Now, granted, that only lasted maybe a couple of weeks, but we still had fun.
[01:57.46]You're too human.
[02:02.00]Hold on, I have a question.
[02:03.86]Hey, how is me... Alright, this is important.
[02:06.70]How is me telling you a story about how me and my brother played too human a -2 joke?
[02:13.52]Or a +2 joke, for that matter.
[02:17.77]That doesn't even make any sense.
[02:19.81]You know, my fond memories of me and my brother playing too human on the couch.
[02:24.85]That wasn't very funny.
[02:27.86]That was really funny.
[02:31.37]Oh.
[02:33.75]You got an emote?
[02:36.03]Wait, you got an emote.
[02:38.45]Only visible to you.
[02:39.75]You got an emote today.
[02:41.97]Thanks to EX Theo's subscription.
[02:46.11]Thank him?
[02:46.55]Hold on, I can say thank you.
[02:48.57]What does that do?
[02:51.35]Thanks for the hyper slam.
[02:53.35]Hold on.
[02:54.19]How does this work?
[03:02.66]I just hit enter.
[03:03.84]I don't know what I did.
[03:07.10]I just apparently thanked that person.
[03:10.38]Hey, thanks.
[03:16.99]Thank me instead.
[03:17.95]I don't think I've seen that before.
[03:20.17]Alright, this is Eternal Darkness.
[03:23.85]Let's move over to the streaming screen so you can see what's going on here.
[03:28.21]Are we kind of loud?
[03:29.21]But it's okay.
[03:30.15]I will turn it down for you.
[03:36.25]I'm ready to play.
[03:40.69]I have played this game before.
[03:42.31]It was about 20 years ago, as you see, 2002.
[03:44.91]So it's been a while.
[03:46.69]But I want to relive it.
[03:49.85]Audio not synced up.
[03:52.01]There's no audio to sync up.
[03:53.09]What are you talking about?
[03:58.82]Dude, audio is not even synced up.
[04:00.56]Let's test.
[04:06.10]Fuck, I just turned into the demo at Radio Shack.
[04:11.32]Where you go in and you press the buttons on the keyboard.
[04:14.04]You press like... 014!
[04:16.15]And then start hitting keys.
[04:20.79]It's fine, we're good.
[04:27.03]Radio Shack isn't real.
[04:28.70]Did they go bankrupt?
[04:30.14]Flesh.
[04:31.86]Bone.
[04:33.33]Bound together with the oddest magical incantation.
[04:37.35]This wretched book is where it all began so long ago.
[04:40.89]A scan today?
[04:41.61]No, no, not today.
[04:43.37]Before humanity.
[04:46.15]I am Dr. Edward Roivas.
[04:48.62]I am a clinical psychologist.
[04:49.68]I love Roivas.
[04:50.84]It's a great tea.
[04:51.44]I am also dead.
[04:52.94]Oh, he's dead.
[04:53.60]This is not my story, nor even the story of the Roivas family.
[04:58.38]It is the story of humanity.
[05:01.48]This is a scary game?
[05:01.92]This is not a scary game.
[05:03.22]Let me correct you.
[05:27.08]This is a... What's going on?
[05:28.50]Game.
[05:28.60]What the hell was that?
[05:29.18]What the fuck was that?
[05:29.68]What?
[05:29.86]It just went purple.
[05:31.82]Alright.
[05:55.89]Come on!
[05:57.53]Don't do this to me!
[06:00.21]No, no, stop outing me!
[06:09.12]Is it emulated?
[06:11.32]I had to!
[06:12.48]Okay?
[06:13.00]Because I have the game, I have the disk, and it wouldn't capture through my fucking capture card!
[06:27.38]We're gonna get, like, purple flashes, aren't we?
[06:29.40]Build a disk?
[06:33.75]I've already shown it!
[06:48.81]Pick up the phone.
[06:49.67]We're gonna get pur- Should I put, like, a warning that says, like, hey, intermediate purple flashing?
[06:56.57]God damn it.
[06:58.73]Of course it couldn't be perfect.
[07:00.51]Looks pretty good though.
[07:17.25]Could I use the Wii for this?
[07:18.25]I did.
[07:19.63]Here's what happened when I went through the Wii.
[07:27.12]And it's because of the capture card.
[07:28.90]I don't know why it's doing it.
[07:29.90]It's fucked up for some reason.
[07:33.92]Yes, my condolences.
[07:37.33]This is most unpleasant.
[07:39.95]It's a shame we couldn't meet under brighter circumstances.
[07:43.69]Oh, it's only going to happen when we change to a different chapter?
[07:47.81]Oh, shit.
[07:48.01]Okay.
[07:48.11]That's not that bad.
[07:48.51]Disable what?
[07:48.79]What should I disable?
[07:49.23]Disable store XFV.
[08:10.45]Alright, where the fuck is that?
[08:11.57]How do I store XFB?
[08:13.67]Is that your grandfather, Edward?
[08:17.66]Yes, it's him.
[08:20.00]He's wearing our family ring.
[08:21.52]Store XFB to texture only to avoid this.
[08:26.62]I don't understand.
[08:28.16]Why are you showing me this?
[08:29.98]Can't you check dental records or something?
[08:31.82]What is wrong with you?
[08:36.66]I'm sorry.
[08:37.40]I already know what happens.
[08:38.26]Her grandfather was Edgar Allan Poe and he wrote The Raven in here and the place is cursed.
[08:43.89]That's who cares.
[08:44.73]There's no head.
[08:46.19]None of this makes sense.
[08:47.81]There's no sign of intrusion and there was certainly a lot of force used here.
[08:52.14]I have never seen anything like this in my 20 years on the force.
[08:56.40]We have no evidence except for the body and what's left doesn't say much.
[09:02.38]When I go on my... I'll change it.
[09:05.96]I feel like that's probably somewhere easy to find in the... Go into the registry editor.
[09:09.08]Hold on a minute.
[09:09.72]I don't want to do that in the middle of the stream.
[09:11.86]Two weeks later.
[09:12.22]Purple flash incoming.
[09:12.80]No?
[09:12.90]We're good.
[09:13.12]Turn on real XFB.
[09:13.52]Or after...
[09:32.38]Okay, a real ex-FB.
[09:33.76]Shocked by her grandfather's mysterious death and frustrated at the incompetence of the local police, Alex vows to uncover the truth.
[09:43.55]She decides to search the mansion, the place where Edward Allen Poe conducted his research.
[09:53.20]If there was a tie to his past and possibly a tie to his murder, it would be here.
[09:58.50]Welcome to Eternal Dr. Sanity's End.
[10:04.18]Okay, we got a search.
[10:05.12]There's a punch.
[10:05.84]Game already has plus one letter grade.
[10:11.00]What do I think about VR, Sam, and Max?
[10:14.10]Kinda cool, I guess.
[10:18.34]It really is kind of like Resident Evil, huh?
[10:24.31]This is a sword with something I can't...
[10:27.73]Ooh, scary whispers!
[10:29.39]A wooden plaque is fastened to the door, taking the place of the lock.
[10:33.11]A colored sigil is carved into the wood above a wide slot.
[10:36.61]The slot is just wide enough to insert a narrow blade.
[10:38.31]I need a sword to open this probably, if I remember.
[10:41.18]How do I run?
[10:41.62]Is there a run?
[10:42.82]Yeah, it doesn't run.
[10:45.38]Okay.
[10:46.46]Good.
[10:48.40]What about House Flipper VR?
[10:49.36]I mean, that's kind of cool, but I feel like I already know what that's going to be like.
[10:55.93]I feel like I've already played that for some reason.
[10:57.47]I don't know why.
[10:57.91]Alright, we're gonna play the piano.
[11:03.50]I wish I could just sit down and just do like a Mozart piece right now.
[11:25.13]You know, I really think I wish... You know how games have minigames?
[11:28.57]You said, you're like, oh, well, this is a cool little feature for a minigame.
[11:31.13]How come there's never been a full piano that you control with left stick and, like, the two bumpers on the left side and right stick for your right hand for the right trigger and right bumper?
[11:43.52]That'd be so much fun if you could just... I don't know why no one's done that.
[11:46.03]It's so easy.
[11:47.35]Happens in Half- Alyx.
[11:49.37]Thanks for the spoiler.
[11:50.01]Hey, thanks for spoiling the entire series of Half- Alyx to me.
[11:53.81]There's a piano you can play.
[11:54.95]Thank you.
[11:57.95]The illustration features a collection of strange line designs related to each other in a cyclical manner.
[12:03.09]There's some significance to it, but it's particularly evident.
[12:06.87]It isn't particularly evident.
[12:07.69]Okay.
[12:10.99]I gotta find the secrets.
[12:14.63]Alright, so at what point does my screen turn off and, like, the Kojima Hideo blinks in the top right corner?
[12:19.75]Doesn't that happen in this game?
[12:27.02]Clock?
[12:29.60]A beautiful carriage clock.
[12:31.04]The hands appear to be stuck.
[12:32.96]Yet the clock continues to tick, with the time permanently set to 333.
[12:37.06]There is a key in the back of the clock, presumably for winding it.
[12:42.19]Wind the key, yes.
[12:44.94]Alex picks up the desk clock and pulls the key from it.
[12:47.58]However, there's something odd about the key.
[12:49.34]It isn't for a winding at all.
[12:51.44]It looks like a dresser key.
[12:54.52]Nice.
[12:54.90]Alright, open a bedroom.
[12:58.68]We've got to find bedroom.
[13:00.43]Bedroom 1.
[13:10.51]Fortress of the Ancestral Roivis Line.
[13:12.85]The foyer walls.
[13:15.88]Their faces reveal a dark, brooding edge.
[13:18.00]There's something about each one that gives the viewer an unsettling feeling.
[13:23.39]This is the Luigi's Mansion house.
[13:28.11]I mean, every horror movie mansion is the exact same.
[13:32.94]They all are the Resident Evil house.
[13:36.53]They all have this gigantic red carpet bullshit that goes up two big flights of stairs that are parallel to each other.
[13:44.62]And then there's two rooms on the left and two rooms on the right.
[13:50.98]And one all the way down in the hallway.
[13:52.56]This is how every single horror movie mansion is.
[13:54.91]It doesn't matter what game.
[13:55.97]It doesn't matter what movie.
[13:56.69]It's all exactly the same.
[13:59.83]It's identical.
[14:07.71]Door's locked.
[14:09.28]Oh, I gotta go to the dresser.
[14:14.50]What a worthless hallway, by the way.
[14:17.34]What's this for?
[14:19.80]Why not just end the wall there?
[14:21.29]Save yourself, like, fuckin' five grand on new building costs.
[14:26.37]Is this a secret room?
[14:27.61]Yeah, that's true.
[14:28.67]Sorry.
[14:28.81]Alright, this is the study.
[14:33.70]Five grand on new building costs.
[14:38.14]Yeah, I don't know what that was.
[14:39.70]What does that mean?
[14:41.54]New building costs.
[14:43.40]That was just a bad translation.
[14:56.51]I was trying to say a redone kitchen.
[15:01.34]In the warm glow of the candlelight, the Roivas family tree hangs from the wall.
[15:06.19]Shadows flitter across its surface, obscuring the detail.
[15:09.45]If one looks closely, the family's secrets are revealed.
[15:11.55]We'll look closely.
[15:14.79]Oh, where's the bedroom?
[15:23.91]Door is locked.
[15:24.49]How do I open?
[15:25.75]Where's the dresser?
[15:27.35]Dresser!
[15:27.99]No, I don't care about that guy.
[15:30.71]I missed a door?
[15:31.21]I'm going to hurry up.
[15:34.26]No, it's 333 forever.
[15:35.32]Don't worry.
[15:36.34]This one?
[15:36.66]Okay.
[15:53.68]Puzzle game.
[15:54.28]No, I'm fine.
[15:59.08]Oh, it's right there.
[16:01.90]This is not a puzzle game, by the way.
[16:03.30]This is just a remember where the door is game.
[16:11.09]It's not a puzzle game.
[16:12.25]No.
[16:12.51]Plus, you guys can just give me the answers.
[16:13.93]It's fine.
[16:17.69]Okay, it's time for me to be upfront with you.
[16:19.65]I don't want to lie.
[16:20.27]I have to tell you the truth.
[16:21.45]I've looked at chat more time than I've looked at the screen with the game on it.
[16:25.37]I swear to God, I've just been hanging out with you guys, just looking at chat.
[16:28.77]I haven't even been playing.
[16:29.73]Okay, so I gotta play.
[16:31.73]What did I miss?
[16:35.47]If you... I wish I could have a... I wish I could time that or something.
[16:41.92]What door did I miss?
[16:50.78]Do an eye tracker.
[16:53.60]An eye tracker stream for me would be, you guys would hate it.
[16:56.69]Some of you guys would throw up.
[17:01.79]You would just see how crazed I am on a daily basis.
[17:06.01]You'd be like, wait a minute, there has to be a calibration problem.
[17:08.83]How did it go into the four corners of the screen 10 times in the last one second?
[17:13.63]That's impossible.
[17:14.85]Hey dude, your calibration's wrong.
[17:18.49]Set this time to 333. 333.
[18:01.86]The secret study.
[18:03.78]Don't touch that.
[18:04.60]Purple screen fix coming through.
[18:10.51]jermaWalk.
[18:11.15]Hold on a minute.
[18:11.81]This is important.
[18:17.83]Oh, man.
[18:19.86]Can I, like...
[18:21.58]Does that person, like, have a sub?
[18:24.18]They gave me a picture book.
[18:26.60]Like, for a child.
[18:28.54]Graphics.
[18:29.68]Hacks.
[18:30.92]Bang, bang.
[18:31.98]Bang.
[18:34.60]Wait, did you... Wait, hold on.
[18:35.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18:36.87]Do I check that box?
[18:38.47]Or do I... Do I just do exactly what you gave me in, like, the fucking pop-up book?
[18:44.73]Alright, wait.
[18:45.09]I gotta get to a save point before I do this.
[18:46.65]Let me get to a save point first.
[18:49.13]There's gonna be a purple flash, by the way.
[18:53.98]I have to warn everybody, there's a purple flash that happens when we change chapters, and then I'm gonna save the game, and then bang, I'm gonna go turn that off.
[19:00.56]Okay, so I really am warning you that it's not like a joke, I'm not fucking around.
[19:03.12]Like, seriously, it's bad.
[19:06.06]A large leather-bound antique book.
[19:07.95]Open it.
[19:10.89]And it opened to 16x10 resolution.
[19:19.63]This is C'Thun.
[19:25.71]I had no knowledge of what was to come.
[19:28.85]Nor did I care.
[19:31.33]How the knowledge changed me.
[19:32.83]I have to do a wow reference.
[19:33.87]It will also change you.
[19:35.06]Every single string.
[19:36.32]As you read this, you will come to learn fear as I have.
[19:39.28]Hold on, I'm talking over the cutscene.
[19:41.60]You too will come to understand.
[19:44.42]Is her voice talking?
[19:45.58]Or you will perish.
[19:46.49]No, it's not.
[19:47.55]She's reading the book.
[19:50.03]Purple, be careful, Purple, I'm serious.
[19:59.43]No, that's bullshit, dude.
[20:01.01]Nobody reads a book in their own voice.
[20:05.14]That would be strange.
[20:08.28]Why would you give every character your voice?
[20:10.52]Fucking Purple, I told you.
[20:12.72]Sorry.
[20:13.08]I told you it was coming.
[20:14.68]I hope I warned you long enough.
[20:17.46]Can you imagine reading a book in your voice?
[20:19.82]Yes.
[20:20.06]I would like to compliment you once more on your battle tactics.
[20:24.60]Our enemies did not have a chance.
[20:27.41]Do you believe that it really exists, Centurion?
[20:46.35]What?
[20:46.47]Hold on a minute.
[20:47.09]So when a character talks in a book, you don't hear somebody else's voice.
[20:51.23]You hear your voice talking.
[20:52.13]What?
[20:52.61]No, yes.
[20:52.75]Yes, yes.
[20:52.93]What are you talking about?
[21:15.65]When I read a book, I can... Okay, let's put it this way.
[21:20.70]So, in like the Game of Thrones books, when Littlefinger talks, is it you doing a Littlefinger impression or is it the Littlefinger actor talking and you hear it?
[21:31.56]Both?
[21:42.06]I hear Littlefinger talking.
[21:43.10]I hear the actor talking.
[21:53.79]Something wrong with me?
[21:59.21]Purple, be careful.
[22:02.00]Give me a save point so I can fix this.
[22:09.48]Cat has no inner monolog.
[22:11.22]Omega lul.
[22:12.48]Wait, what?
[22:16.81]second.
[22:18.52]No, that's not even true.
[22:19.72]Everybody has an internal monolog.
[22:21.66]My internal monolog, I can get to be somebody else, though.
[22:26.74]Like, okay, right now, I'm, okay, I'm thinking of a Spongebob episode, where Spongebob, like, grabs Patrick's nose, squeezes it, and says, this thing's gigantic.
[22:34.57]That's not me saying that in my head.
[22:35.99]Spongebob is saying that.
[22:37.09]I'm hearing it.
[22:45.93]Not Patrick Squidward.
[22:47.23]Whatever.
[22:54.06]Everybody has that.
[22:54.84]The die on this floor is finally crafted.
[22:58.34]Inlet with golden gems that we as skin to identify.
[23:02.92]Strong linear design is situated in the middle and is equally unknown to the Roman soldier.
[23:12.40]On that fucking morning radio.
[23:15.63]What the fuck?
[23:16.83]Alright, so there's the symbol.
[23:20.67]It's all about symbols in this game.
[23:22.88]I do have a weapon now, though, which is cool.
[23:25.46]There's a cock and then there's a whip.
[23:27.38]You have to manually save.
[23:32.60]How?
[23:36.15]This function allows the manipulation of inventory items.
[23:38.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:41.29]Okay, equip the character with a weapon.
[23:44.32]Lossy examination of objects.
[23:46.74]Press L or R by switching back and forth between the sections.
[23:49.38]Alright.
[23:53.22]Oh, shit, it is.
[23:53.76]There it is.
[23:54.10]It is a manual save.
[23:55.76]Alright, let me get this done.
[24:01.46]There we go.
[24:04.12]Alright, I thought... My fucking computer... I don't know what that was in the top left.
[24:07.98]It could have just been my fucking... Whatever.
[24:10.52]Okay, so that's good.
[24:13.18]We're good.
[24:15.97]S10W update.
[24:18.17]Gave 150 10,000 bits.
[24:19.83]I'm stupid.
[24:23.96]So that's like $150,000.
[24:24.38]Alright, let me get this.
[24:27.42]Let me fix this before we get started, for real.
[24:28.94]So that's saved.
[24:30.12]Give me one sec.
[24:31.54]That's a lot of money, though.
[24:32.86]Hold on.
[24:35.54]This is good to go.
[24:36.10]Let me check this box.
[24:37.90]Reboot it.
[24:39.15]Okay, somebody just gave a lot of money.
[24:44.14]That was $100 from S10WUpdate.
[24:48.08]Thanks for the hundred fucking bucks.
[24:50.63]Jesus.
[24:51.29]People still give me insane money.
[24:52.81]I don't even... I can't even believe it.
[24:58.01]They say that they took my advice and now they're the 47th richest person in the world.
[25:01.95]Here's your cut.
[25:04.96]Peace and love.
[25:10.62]Alright, let's get the... I gotta...
[25:12.65]I gotta get this to... Hold on.
[25:13.63]Graphics?
[25:15.62]Hacks.
[25:17.96]Well, mine doesn't look like that.
[25:19.16]Mine doesn't look like that.
[25:23.42]Uncheck it?
[25:25.88]Wait.
[25:26.18]Uncheck that store EFB copies, right?
[25:29.00]Or check it because it was checked already.
[25:32.60]Okay.
[25:32.94]That's all I have to do?
[25:36.76]Skip EFB access from CPU.
[25:40.34]Alright.
[25:40.56]I unchecked it.
[25:41.12]Let's see if it fixes it.
[25:43.49]Uncheck everything.
[25:44.55]Alright, I unchecked it.
[25:50.89]It's unchecked.
[25:51.47]I'm ready to start.
[25:52.81]Alright, I have the latest version of that software.
[25:54.91]Alright, let's go.
[26:00.35]Deep into that darkness peering.
[26:03.87]Long I stood there.
[26:06.67]Wondering, fearing.
[26:08.68]You unchecked the wrong one.
[26:10.72]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:11.92]This person gave me detailed fourth grade information.
[26:20.76]A game.
[26:21.20]Alright, it might flash purple.
[26:23.50]I'm just warning you.
[26:24.22]Hopefully it doesn't.
[26:24.84]Let's see what happens.
[26:28.26]I unchecked it.
[26:32.46]You are from the third grade.
[26:34.76]Get banned.
[26:35.86]Get banned.
[26:37.00]Idiot.
[26:45.59]The ladder leads into the dank heart of the labyrinth.
[26:50.50]Danger lurks beneath.
[26:52.28]Let P.S.
[26:54.00]purge Jesus.
[27:05.74]You know, I just found out a new category for 2020's end-of-the-year awards.
[27:09.75]Uh...
[27:14.28]Worst reading.
[27:15.82]Or worst talking.
[27:19.72]Courage Jesus.
[27:22.62]Like, absolutely worst mispronunciation.
[27:24.77]I don't know what the fuck is going on, man.
[27:27.13]I aged a hundred years in fucking five.
[27:28.85]I don't get it.
[27:29.33]This guy's gonna get up just like Dark Souls 2.
[27:44.64]Okay, so this is ready and this is swings.
[27:55.31]Look, you just have to hit people.
[28:01.57]You can aim for their heads too, right?
[28:02.61]Oh yeah, you can aim for their body parts.
[28:04.03]This game is actually pretty cool for its time.
[28:09.73]You can target body parts.
[28:12.82]And we have a 5 finish hit.
[28:13.82]Should we get a 5 second slow mode so I can re-chat?
[28:18.93]Wouldn't that be worse?
[28:26.55]This meter represents life energy.
[28:28.81]Every time a character takes damage, the level will get lower.
[28:31.05]When it reaches 0, the character will die.
[28:33.09]Okay.
[28:35.79]I know what health does.
[28:38.19]I mean, this was 2002, right?
[28:38.79]This wasn't, like, 1930.
[28:39.37]People before your, what?
[28:40.05]Slapstick sounds?
[28:40.61]Slapstick.
[29:06.29]That was pretty slapstick.
[29:08.59]Strange granite block lies on the floor.
[29:10.49]Okay, I can put that block up there.
[29:17.26]Do you smell burnt toast?
[29:18.58]Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.
[29:20.60]It's like sulfur, right?
[29:21.50]If you smell sulfur, it doesn't mean you're getting possessed by a demon.
[29:27.30]Wait, should I go up?
[29:30.94]Knock on the door first?
[29:31.66]Yeah.
[29:34.24]Oh, I have to get all the cubes.
[29:41.28]100% sure.
[29:41.66]Yeah, it's something like that.
[29:43.69]It's something like that.
[29:48.35]God damn it.
[29:51.57]Why does that person have to say that?
[29:53.35]Slapstick.
[29:57.23]It actually is.
[30:00.99]Well, you just have to add... I'm so annoyed by that.
[30:08.36]One of the editors, just here, do me a favor.
[30:10.92]I'm gonna swing at a bunch of them and then just put, like, Curly Larry and Moe talking and colloquialisms behind it.
[30:19.98]It's perfect.
[30:20.69]I'll get it for you.
[30:31.73]Don't do that.
[30:32.37]Why not?
[30:33.03]That's funny.
[30:41.53]Watch out!
[30:41.87]I want to go for the legs.
[30:44.05]Need on?
[30:44.99]Need on yet, maybe I have to learn it.
[30:49.07]Alright, everybody quiet.
[31:09.40]Okay, I'm realizing something.
[31:10.34]That's like Curly, Larry, and Moe killing each other.
[31:15.02]You hear like a knife sound.
[31:16.34]A knife going into a body.
[31:18.92]All the while, with the Three Stooges goofy sound effect sound.
[31:27.90]That's like Moe killing Larry and Curly.
[31:32.47]With a knife in the kitchen.
[31:34.61]That's fucked up.
[31:43.12]How many were there?
[31:44.72]Four blocks?
[31:56.89]Dead?
[31:58.29]Die!
[31:59.97]Die!
[32:05.07]Get on the ground!
[32:09.05]Stay on the ground.
[32:10.69]Die!
[32:16.59]I have three.
[32:17.45]Yeah, I gotta place them in the... I know where I gotta go with it.
[32:27.64]One's gonna be walking right down this hallway.
[32:30.98]What's this guy's name?
[32:35.02]Pius?
[32:42.88]John Pius.
[32:44.82]I don't think his name is John.
[32:55.15]Alright, here we go.
[33:02.35]No, it's not.
[33:03.23]Biggest dickest.
[33:05.48]Alright, put the red one in here.
[33:10.14]What into the wall is a square?
[33:11.34]Alright, we have to... Ah, that's... I gotta go... It's gonna have to go to 16 by 10 every time I go in the menu.
[33:22.86]What's so funny about Biggest Dickest?
[33:25.70]Look it up.
[33:26.06]It's a funny Monty Python thing.
[33:40.55]Did I miss one?
[33:43.49]I actually missed one.
[33:47.60]You're a fake fan?
[33:49.14]What are you talking about?
[33:55.69]Give me that last one.
[33:58.95]Purple.
[34:01.25]If it's not pre-recorded, say that word.
[34:03.25]No.
[34:03.37]Now you know.
[34:04.81]The word is P. It rhymes with intravenous.
[34:13.84]I guess.
[34:30.19]No, nobody said that.
[34:34.93]I made it up.
[34:35.47]I heard Spongebob say it in my head.
[34:53.58]Didn't happen in the show.
[34:57.13]Don't you understand?
[34:57.63]I can get Spongebob to say anything in my head.
[35:08.40]Ow.
[35:08.70]I just can.
[35:09.96]You must prove your worth by destroying this statue.
[35:15.62]Yeah, so I have to destroy the whole thing?
[35:17.52]Back the head and the arms.
[35:21.28]Prove it.
[35:21.64]How can I prove something like that?
[35:31.23]Right now, SpongeBob, in my head, just said, My name's Jerma985.
[35:36.12]I'm streaming live on Jerma- And he's at the computer and stuff.
[35:38.80]Like, I can get him to say whatever I want.
[35:39.94]I just heard him do it.
[35:54.23]Are you guys figuring out that I have some kind of weird superpower where I can hear other people talking in my head?
[35:59.93]If I want to?
[36:08.23]It's a superpower.
[36:14.48]I have an eternal monolog.
[36:16.10]Yeah, I have both.
[36:16.84]I can just... I can shapeshift.
[36:21.58]It's really hard to explain.
[36:30.65]A button attached to a small pylon softly illuminates the room.
[36:35.95]A bizarre energy seems to radiate from it.
[36:38.92]Press it.
[36:41.86]Press A. There are people that cannot think of words, just concept and images.
[36:52.54]I don't know.
[36:53.94]This is news to me.
[36:57.22]I can see words in my head right now.
[36:59.30]I'm spelling them out.
[37:00.07]I can just see them.
[37:01.05]The ball is bouncing on the lyrics at the bottom of the video.
[37:03.25]I'm literally seeing every word I'm saying.
[37:04.73]Not everyone has the internal monolog.
[37:12.68]Is it real?
[37:15.88]Wait, I have to choose a power?
[37:19.64]What's the best Kingdom Hearts thing to do?
[37:22.98]Health, magic, or damage.
[37:25.17]It's never magic, by the way.
[37:27.25]They just put it there because Disney is magical and shit.
[37:29.60]It doesn't do anything.
[37:31.82]Shield and power are the best ones.
[37:38.35]Let's see.
[37:39.87]Details.
[37:41.03]An effigy resembling a warped angel shaped from the dark green emerald.
[37:46.62]Covers effortlessly above the pedestal.
[37:48.96]Should Aias claim this artifact?
[37:52.20]Alright, hold on.
[37:52.76]No.
[37:55.68]I pressed A. I pressed yes.
[37:57.02]I was trying to press B. Looks like we're going with the earthbenders.
[38:16.78]Shit.
[38:18.28]Accidental super power.
[38:20.40]God damn it.
[38:21.52]Whatever.
[38:21.94]This is the best one anyways.
[38:37.31]Hey, notice how there's no white symbol here?
[38:39.76]HEY!
[38:40.38]It's supposed to be fixed!
[38:44.47]I was once as naive as a child.
[38:47.61]But now my mind is sharp.
[38:49.86]Anyways, notice how there was no air symbol there?
[38:54.06]Just saying.
[38:55.84]Fucking purple shit ruined my joke.
[38:58.22]You know that was going to be funny.
[38:59.36]Fucking stupid ass purple bullshit.
[39:09.99]Now the text is purple.
[39:11.67]Great.
[39:12.21]It's mocking me.
[39:15.35]Tomb of the Eternal Darkness.
[39:18.86]Hey, Professor Richard Cheese, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[39:23.92]Read it this time.
[39:24.86]Ow, fuck!
[39:25.36]What do you mean, read it?
[39:27.24]There was no text on it before.
[39:34.71]Read.
[39:35.05]It just... Story... Mine was already checked.
[39:38.03]Mine was already checked, man.
[39:46.57]I was checked already.
[39:49.97]Graphics.
[39:51.31]Hacks.
[39:54.65]Dip EFB axis from CPU.
[39:56.21]Should I check it?
[39:57.95]Pretty cool game.
[39:58.55]The game is actually pretty cool.
[40:05.55]Store EFB right now to textures only was checked already.
[40:11.06]Make the check marks that are in the image.
[40:19.60]hold on fast depth calculation I'm gonna copy this person's homework internal frame buffer wait why are there two of these wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute this -2 or xfb copies to texture store efb copies to texture like it's xfb right
[40:49.81]So the AFB was wrong.
[40:53.35]I have the old version.
[40:54.23]I have the new version of... I have the new version.
[40:57.69]Chroma key out the color purple.
[40:59.35]No, you motherfucker.
[41:04.72]Turn on real XFB or disable XF store.
[41:07.90]So this, the tutorial that I got in the Imgr link is wrong.
[41:12.44]They maybe unchecked the wrong thing.
[41:21.56]That's not even a debate, I think that person was trying to be helpful.
[41:24.61]Fuck, I was gonna like mod that guy.
[41:28.47]Okay, I just tried, I unchecked the thing, let's see what happens.
[41:36.95]Key out purple, I can't just key out the color purple.
[41:41.63]Yeah, it's store XFB, not DFB.
[41:45.49]That's the- XFB is the one that I have to uncheck.
[41:48.46]So, the really easy tutorial was actually wrong and hard.
[41:54.74]Let me do it.
[41:58.08]If it happens again, I'll try- I'll key it up.
[42:06.41]What?
[42:07.41]Disable XFB?
[42:08.79]Fuck, it was EFB in this guy's image.
[42:10.93]Oh no!
[42:16.08]OK, I got to pay attention.
[42:17.06]I got to pay attention.
[42:17.66]I got to pay attention.
[42:22.51]Wait.
[42:23.65]There's going to be some coordinates here.
[42:25.07]Hold on.
[42:25.41]Alright, what is this?
[42:28.09]A crank socket is mounted to the telescope.
[42:30.37]It must be linked to a mirror supported by a brass pedestal.
[42:35.39]Curious contraption to be sure.
[42:36.99]What purpose can it possibly serve?
[42:38.51]Did you adjust it?
[42:40.91]Yes.
[42:48.78]It reminds me of like how old TV shows used to do guy is AI or made out of machines and is talking.
[42:56.14]Oh, yes.
[42:57.42]Mr. Stevenson, it is so glad to see you.
[43:01.70]I am so happy to see you.
[43:11.88]Pretty torn on that one.
[43:13.21]I see a lot of people didn't like it.
[43:14.31]A lot of people did.
[43:15.67]Hmm.
[43:16.94]It's pretty interesting.
[43:18.42]Okay, this is open.
[43:19.06]What did it open?
[43:23.68]Examine.
[43:24.10]A globe cradled in a wooden frame.
[43:26.86]Its glossy surface is painted in the likeness of an ancient map.
[43:31.56]A lens is situated in the northern hemisphere above a label that reads, There be dragons here.
[43:36.06]There's two of these, though.
[43:43.45]Just a mirror?
[43:44.35]Should I... Wait a minute.
[43:54.26]There's nothing in the top crank, though.
[43:58.48]Do you guys see a mirror?
[43:59.34]Where's the mirror?
[44:10.41]Did it say I was adjusting a mirror?
[44:17.33]The thing up top?
[44:18.45]Hold on.
[44:19.03]Why is it making that noise?
[44:28.15]Are there any more of these?
[44:28.79]Shit, there's another one of these over here, too.
[44:42.68]Fuck, what do I do with this?
[44:45.26]Can I not do this yet?
[44:45.98]I don't think I can do this yet.
[44:48.06]Come back later.
[44:59.00]The fuck?
[44:59.26]I just got the Twitter notification you sent out.
[45:02.14]Dude, what?
[45:02.66]Where you been?
[45:03.18]Alright, let's go.
[45:07.21]Where could I not go before?
[45:07.97]Let's go this way.
[45:11.71]Is this open now?
[45:13.17]No, this is locked.
[45:24.17]This is green now.
[45:24.99]Okay.
[45:26.35]Okay.
[45:30.32]Please, for the love of God, don't do that.
[45:31.56]Okay.
[45:35.05]Uh, is it like a family sword?
[45:36.75]I have to go get, like, P.S.'
[45:37.91]'s sword or something, right?
[45:39.01]How come every game I play has instant messenger sounds?
[45:48.38]Fuck, stop ruining a game I like!

[46:28.75]It's here somewhere.
[46:31.17]Give me the sword!
[46:34.27]Oh, let's go down here.
[46:39.17]Lore is unimportant.
[46:40.55]No, lore is not unimportant.
[46:41.67]Lore is unimportant for me streaming.
[46:48.92]Good.
[46:50.82]Painting of a jungle shrouded building.
[46:52.62]It seems to be a temple in Asia, perhaps from Thailand or Cambodia.
[47:01.08]Got it.
[47:02.28]Ancient Roman weapon, a gladius.
[47:03.90]Take it.
[47:07.27]Go put that sword in that door.
[47:08.85]Expressor key and second floor key.
[47:17.52]I don't, I can't use it.
[47:18.50]Alright, got the sword.
[47:24.02]Let's try to stick the sword into the door.
[47:33.79]Let her rest.
[47:34.73]What?
[47:35.65]Why?
[47:35.81]I can't... Oh, right.
[47:38.47]Because I'm holding down left trigger.
[47:39.89]Okay, she's fine.
[47:44.61]You're killing her.
[47:46.68]I'm going to be fine.
[47:56.04]I don't care about this.
[47:56.76]I want to stick this into wherever it was.
[48:01.55]Where is it?
[48:06.39]This way?
[48:08.54]No, it's one of the left doors.
[48:14.22]You know you're going to be fine.
[48:15.16]We're concerned about her.
[48:16.26]Alright, stick it in.
[48:30.88]Stick the sword in.
[48:32.68]The slot is wide enough to insert a narrow blade.
[48:44.88]God damn it.
[48:47.58]Alex places the blade in the slot but feels it push back.
[48:51.74]It is as if the magic of the blade does not fit the lock.
[48:55.06]So I gotta go like bless this thing in the blood of the green guy, right?
[49:03.03]How do we do that?
[49:11.85]Gotta be a slime guy sword.
[49:13.35]Yeah.
[49:13.59]Alright, well, how do we do that, though?
[49:14.73]Okay, so green eats blue, blue eats red, red eats green, and purple is not part of the food chain.
[49:31.66]Okay.
[49:36.79]Oh, please make monkey noises.
[49:38.19]We're not going- we're not doing that again.
[49:39.79]Okay.
[49:40.03]Okay.
[49:41.52]No.
[49:42.82]You did that once, and I'm not doing it again.
[49:53.05]Please.
[49:56.89]No.
[50:00.18]No, I'm not going to do monkey noises.
[50:02.16]No.
[50:05.34]No.
[50:10.21]The key comes apart on the lock.
[50:11.39]The key to the second floor is broken.
[50:12.88]Is there a way of repairing it?
[50:15.30]Alex has picked up the broken second floor key.
[50:17.56]Can I not use... What?
[50:18.64]It's still locked?
[50:20.86]The key must be repaired somehow.
[50:23.04]God damn it.
[50:34.49]Okay.
[50:37.19]Stop.
[50:37.61]And I'm never doing it again.
[50:38.49]I am never doing it again.
[50:40.77]Even for a thousand dollars.
[50:42.27]Is this still... I don't know.
[50:50.35]Can I do anything with this?
[50:51.19]Can I stick the sword in?
[50:52.21]No.
[50:56.50]-2.
[50:57.02]What a sellout.
[50:57.78]That means he'll... Yeah, that means I'll... No.
[50:59.48]That's not what I'll mean.
[51:00.54]Not a thousand and one.
[51:02.02]I'm not doing it again.
[51:02.76]I need to... Hold on.
[51:04.74]I need to bless this fucking sword.
[51:17.60]Gonna go into the sword room.
[51:21.03]Back into the library.
[51:21.89]Wait, book in the sword room.
[51:27.17]Use your special book.
[51:32.82]This is the Tome of Eternal Darkness.
[51:36.22]With spells.
[51:37.68]Whatever.
[51:44.03]I'm going to go back.
[51:44.83]I think I'm going to go into the library.
[51:46.19]Where's the library again?
[51:48.01]I read that.
[51:48.57]Something in here?
[51:50.51]Do an antelope now.
[52:09.12]I don't know what an antelope sounds like.
[52:10.94]I have no clue.
[52:11.96]Did I miss something in here?
[52:15.86]Some kind of mask.
[52:16.76]The face is serene in composure.
[52:22.37]Oh.
[52:24.27]Cool.
[52:25.43]Strangely, with the Tome of Eternal Darkness in her possession, Alex can read the page.
[52:29.83]It is a chapter page from the Tome itself.
[52:32.97]Take the chapter.
[52:34.49]Found the chapter page, titled The Binding of the Corpse God.
[52:37.35]Put it in the book and read it.
[52:44.88]No purple.
[52:45.62]Are there any books about, like, magic from 1400s or 1500s or something?
[53:10.09]Since time immemorial, ancient peoples have dressed up their lack of knowledge as gods and demons.
[53:17.36]I have discovered that sometimes the fates of gods and mortals intertwine.
[53:22.13]The legends are born.
[53:24.29]I guess I am just describing the Bible.
[53:25.73]I'm like, yeah, well, I want more of that, though.
[53:32.87]Thy time is done, Gray.
[53:34.55]Read the Bibles.
[53:35.93]Forever in shadow will you be master of chaos, and to fade to nothing in obscurity will be thy fate.
[53:45.28]My master has planned many Malenia for this day.
[53:49.48]It is the true chaos of all things that you now must be entombed amongst the beings of flesh and bone.
[53:57.93]See?
[53:58.33]You have a great monument here, Manturok.
[54:01.33]It is a pity that no one will ever recognize it as yours.
[54:08.17]May the darkness claim thee, crawling chaos and damp beast.
[54:13.88]No longer will thy reign be kept over the ancients you have kept imprisoned.
[54:23.22]Thou hast seen the last of this world.
[54:29.52]No, I killed this guy in this thing under here.
[54:39.07]Crushing all of his eyes.
[54:44.13]This is purple guy.
[54:46.83]Though I have claimed this temple in the name of the green guy.
[54:49.75]Yes.
[54:52.76]Okay.
[54:59.92]I only wish something that fantastic and of higher purpose could happen to me.
[55:04.50]Alright, let's go.
[55:09.83]Do I have a weapon?
[55:13.17]Gonna be like puzzles here and shit in there.
[55:20.31]Okay, yeah.
[55:21.27]Triangular design is carved into the floor.
[55:23.15]The etched grooves are filled with colored sand.
[55:25.94]Related to each other.
[55:26.86]Yeah.
[55:27.26]Okay, just keep this in mind.
[55:29.60]We kick red's ass.
[55:31.44]Blue, we have to run away from.
[55:32.89]Just remember that, okay?
[55:34.63]We are not afraid of anything red.
[55:36.17]We are only afraid of blue.
[55:46.34]Yes.
[55:46.42]Strange necklace.
[56:08.24]This necklace can be used to heal Elia.
[56:11.42]Make sure that Elia does not move when the spell is being cast, okay?
[56:15.73]Do I have to use it?
[56:16.95]Okay, I can heal.
[56:18.35]Take a look at what we got for doors here.
[56:23.58]It's kind of dark, don't you think?
[56:26.10]We're gonna go left.
[56:38.74]Is he gonna get up?
[56:45.72]E-mode only mode incoming.
[56:49.07]Um, why?
[56:49.95]Okay, this is gonna- this is harder than I thought it was gonna be.
[56:52.47]This is actually very easy.
[56:59.60]It's not hard at all.
[57:00.44]Let's go left.
[57:03.56]Right.
[57:08.78]Sen's Fortress?
[57:09.72]Oh shit.
[57:11.55]I didn't even mean to do that correctly and I'm doing alright.
[57:19.45]When located by creatures, a sanity loss occurs, causing a decrease in the level of a sanity meter and the character to pulse green.
[57:32.42]Beware, sanity loss affects perception and eventually health.
[57:36.14]Aren't these things in Zelda?
[57:40.12]Okay, what just happened?
[57:41.48]There's your sanity meter.
[57:42.34]This meter represents a character's sanity.
[57:44.94]Every time he or she meets a monster, his sanity or her sanity will get lower.
[57:48.40]The lower the sanity meter, the more the character will hallucinate.
[57:52.56]Yes.
[57:53.24]Okay, here we go.
[58:01.13]Performing a finishing move on a creature recovers sanity.
[58:03.83]That was fucking crazy.
[58:08.87]Give me that sanity back.
[58:16.91]A bronze necklace.
[58:18.45]Take it.
[58:18.69]I have two necklaces.
[58:22.57]Does one do more than the other?
[58:23.87]Is that it?
[58:28.22]Not a door?
[58:35.45]The design on the wall appears to depict a time of the day.
[58:38.03]Perhaps the candles do, too.
[58:41.18]Light or extinguish the candles.
[58:45.78]No, don't just smash it like a four-year-old.
[58:47.86]Okay, here we go.
[58:55.61]Okay, so we have extinguished them all.
[58:58.55]One in the middle.
[58:59.25]It's sun time.
[59:00.21]Yeah, I got it.
[59:14.16]Ow.
[59:16.24]Ow.
[59:16.54]Fuck, I couldn't pay attention to what door just opened.
[59:18.14]Alright, you ever have that... So I just drank... I have a soda water over here.
[59:24.83]Just a carbonated water.
[59:26.13]And you know when you drink it sometimes and you do something weird with your throat?
[59:30.83]Or you turn a weird way and it somehow hurts?
[59:33.61]It goes into like your sinuses and in your nose and it's like... Ah!
[59:36.56]Ah!
[59:38.90]like do it the wrong way somehow and it just kind of goes up to your roof of your mouth and kind of into your yeah I hate that it just happened like the worst it's ever been by the way that was horrible finish
[60:07.34]The sanity meter, if you don't know, if you've never heard of this game, and you're like, what is this game?
[60:10.07]This game's stupid.
[60:10.93]Look at this shitty game that he's playing.
[60:12.83]Well, the whole point of this game is, uh, you have the sanity meter, and the game starts to really fuck with you.
[60:18.91]The game, like, deletes your save files, like, turns off the screen, it, it, you know, torrents movies behind your back, you know, whatever it does.
[60:28.69]It's not good.
[60:30.65]It makes everything really bad, and it fucks up the whole game.
[60:40.93]Stop spoiling.
[60:44.91]Oh, yeah.
[60:45.37]Sorry.
[60:46.21]Never mind.
[60:46.89]This game just sucks.
[60:50.41]Never mind.
[60:50.96]Hey, guys.
[60:51.74]Don't worry.
[60:52.10]The game's just bad.
[60:53.42]The game just sucks.
[60:54.40]Okay?
[60:55.28]There.
[60:56.62]It's just a walk around and swing at enemies.
[60:58.52]It'll open up doors.
[60:59.78]That's it.
[61:01.64]There's nothing cool in this game.
[61:13.45]Engraved on the floor is a striking design featuring the sun rising above the edge of the world.
[61:19.00]I gotta remember that puzzle.
[61:19.90]That's probably why I gotta remember that for some... Ooh, another one of these.
[61:25.86]Appears to depict a time of the day.
[61:27.00]Perhaps a candle... Yeah, they do.
[61:28.76]Alright, so what's wrong with this one?
[61:34.85]Can't blow these candles out.
[61:37.55]Why not?
[61:53.50]Nice dodging.
[61:56.40]It's the easiest thing ever.
[61:59.82]This one's red.
[62:00.53]Red is good, right?
[62:01.21]We can kill red easily.
[62:03.77]Yeah.
[62:05.91]Welcome to Pokémon.
[62:12.22]This is how Pokémon works, right?
[62:21.52]Um.
[62:25.31]What is this doing?
[62:30.01]Not really?
[62:30.55]The grave on the floor is a striking design featuring a starry sky filling the heavens.
[62:44.85]I feel like I'm going to need to remember this shit.
[62:48.57]There's nothing here, but I can't touch it.
[62:49.87]Okay.
[62:50.23]Wait, I can touch it.
[62:51.67]So it's all empty.
[62:53.69]Yeah, that's it.
[62:54.19]Done.
[63:05.99]Both the doors came down.
[63:11.68]When I came in?
[63:12.76]Yeah.
[63:14.60]The door from that other area, which God help me if I can remember where that was.
[63:24.29]That's the Bloodborne noise?
[63:25.41]I don't know, what do you mean?
[63:27.69]Which one?
[63:29.19]Roll the credits.
[63:53.03]Oh, my saber!
[63:54.99]The shitty sword?
[64:05.82]Yeah, that sword was made... That sword was made out of like, rock candy.
[64:15.30]Not even glass.
[64:21.36]Fragments of a shattered short sword lie upon the floor.
[64:23.84]Oh, pick it up.
[64:29.82]Alright, do I get to shoot this guy with a blowgun in the head?
[64:36.32]Wait, these are my friends.
[64:37.32]These are green guys.
[64:38.00]I shouldn't be attacking green guys, right?
[64:39.32]Yeah, I'm like, my sanity's messing up.
[64:51.29]too late for that oh well alright so what do you what who are you the guard is grateful for elia saving his life in return he offers to repair elia's broken weapon as a gesture of thanks thank you thanks that was very very that was way shorter than I thought it was going to be
[65:37.80]I didn't know it was going to happen instantly like that.
[65:40.08]I don't need that guy for anything, right?
[65:45.21]It's Ren and Stimpy.
[65:46.69]Happy, happy, joy, joy.
[65:53.13]Happy, happy, joy, joy.
[65:54.87]Happy, happy, joy, joy.
[65:56.66]Happy, happy, joy.
[65:57.92]Wait, what's wrong with me?
[65:58.76]I'm a monster.
[66:12.08]Wait, I haven't saved the game in probably a full hour.
[66:15.16]I have to win as the slime guy.
[66:19.10]Where do I go?
[66:27.26]This is so stupid.
[66:29.44]No, I don't want to beat this guy anymore.
[66:31.72]Is there anything I can do?
[66:35.86]Let me regain my sanity.
[66:37.96]Let me watch, like, Fred Rogers give a speech so I can at least gain my fucking sanity back.
[66:43.98]Okay.
[66:59.17]This mural depicts a skeletal demon befriending the ancient Khmer people by denouncing one of their fertility gods.
[67:15.62]I'm not even kidding.
[67:16.98]Anytime you feel like shit, anytime you feel fucked up, watch Mr. Rogers talk about anything.
[67:26.31]You will feel fucking great afterwards.
[67:29.23]Alright, I gotta save the game.
[67:46.25]Uh-oh.
[67:48.94]I'm too insane to save the game.
[67:59.00]Why did I have to kill that guy?
[68:01.48]Why?
[68:02.02]What was the point of that?
[68:03.20]It didn't do anything.
[68:04.72]I didn't know.
[68:05.30]I thought it was... I'm going to get some sanity back right here.
[68:07.54]Come on.
[68:09.78]Okay.
[68:14.21]Give me the sword.
[68:14.87]The sword's better.
[68:20.23]I want the sword.
[68:20.81]Alright, what the hell am I doing in here?
[68:22.82]There's a hole in the device as though something can be inserted.
[68:27.32]Perhaps a key or lever.
[68:30.22]I need a key or what do I have?
[68:32.80]What the hell is a strange necklace?
[68:34.24]10.
[68:34.30]Oh yeah, heal.
[68:37.37]My insanity is too low.
[68:38.55]Alright.
[68:42.29]I can't believe I didn't fucking save the game.
[68:44.09]That sucks.
[68:44.59]Alright, I need to get a lever or I gotta get a lever.
[68:54.69]Dave, now you kill the enemy?
[68:55.77]I can't.
[69:03.71]Jesus.
[69:04.30]God.
[69:04.72]That shit's already happening.
[69:15.96]Is this hallway longer?
[69:17.88]What?
[69:18.76]This room is different.
[69:31.11]Okay, I can kill these guys.
[69:33.55]I'm gonna finish off like two or three of them.
[69:48.28]Finish.
[69:51.11]No!
[69:51.49]Don't look at me!
[69:51.97]Stop looking at me, please!
[69:55.21]You fucking can't be serious, dude.
[70:03.67]I had to shoot that guy.
[70:06.13]All because I had to shoot the guy and it ruined everything.
[70:16.84]Come here so I can finish you.
[70:21.10]Thank you.
[70:21.68]My god.
[70:36.08]Okay, I'm back to normal.
[70:37.73]Sort of.
[70:38.01]Now, what opened?
[70:45.13]This is... Alright, this is different.
[70:49.25]Save the game now.
[70:49.77]Go back.
[70:55.59]Oh, yes.
[70:59.33]That was... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[71:02.51]That would have been 45 minutes of lost time doing nothing.
[71:14.06]What is this?
[71:14.44]I got a link?
[71:15.96]What's this link?
[71:17.75]Show me.
[71:19.37]Eternal Purple.
[71:21.05]Jerma Stream... Jerma Stream Fortnite.
[71:25.71]No.
[71:28.11]No.
[71:29.95]No, I don't want to do that.
[71:30.91]I'm not going to stream Fortnite.
[71:36.48]Is this your way to make a funny image?
[71:43.02]I'll look at that and somehow I'll be like, okay, yeah, I'm going to do that.
[71:46.06]Play Fortnite.
[71:53.16]No, I'm not going to play.
[71:53.94]Why would I do that?
[71:55.00]I don't want to play Fortnite.
[71:58.39]This is pretty good, though.
[72:03.87]Wrong link.
[72:04.61]There's no such thing as a wrong link in this stream.
[72:09.27]What would constitute a right link?
[72:17.90]What is this even a reference to?
[72:20.74]No, shit!
[72:26.60]It's me in the mirrors.
[72:35.71]Alright, cool.
[72:36.75]Good, we got it.
[72:38.57]Awesome.
[72:39.03]Alright, let's go.
[72:40.41]Let's go talk to the god.
[72:41.37]Wasn't this thing supposed to be dead?
[72:55.35]Stop.
[72:56.30]Don't go near it.
[73:04.47]Wait, this is even... wait, we're further back?
[73:06.25]The Dead God.
[73:37.26]You are one of the chosen many.
[73:38.10]Relation and blood.
[73:45.37]It is now your destiny to fight the eternal darkness.
[73:48.73]I give you a gift in return for an obligation.
[74:06.05]That's tiny.
[74:06.77]It's like if the heart in your body was as big as a sunflower seed.
[74:39.85]It's not even a heart, it's... Look at how big this guy is!
[74:48.63]This guy has as big as three or four houses.
[74:53.07]That was his heart?
[74:57.24]Alright, I have the Eternal Darkness.
[75:03.84]Petal staff is held by the arms of the statue.
[75:06.92]I have acquired the staff.
[75:10.83]There's your lever.
[75:14.67]And he looks like a cabbage.
[75:25.26]I've not really seen it, but... Don't even fight him.
[75:30.62]Don't fight him.
[75:31.00]Don't fight him.
[75:31.38]Don't fight him.
[75:35.34]Oh my goodness fucking gracious.
[75:37.26]Why did I just do that?
[75:50.52]Okay, fuck it who cares finish this guy I just peeled my nose off, but my whole front part of my face just came off I'm not getting sanity for that
[76:22.68]Hurry up!
[76:23.16]I'm going!
[76:26.60]Shit!
[76:26.88]I'm insane!
[76:27.82]I don't know what to do!
[76:29.60]Put the thing in quick!
[76:31.14]What did that do?
[76:40.21]It... What if all of a sudden he just got slimed?
[76:44.37]That's it.
[76:45.85]Behind him!
[77:01.58]Wrong way.
[77:03.98]Wrong way?
[77:04.54]What?
[77:04.74]Didn't I go from the other room?
[77:08.14]Wrong way?
[77:08.72]That's the only way!
[77:38.33]Okay, I'm good.
[77:39.25]Wait, shit, it was the wrong way.
[77:42.12]What?
[77:42.42]It won't crush me.
[77:57.40]Wait.
[77:59.56]Am I getting Luigi'd?
[78:04.66]I get the bad ending already?
[78:05.86]What did that even do?
[78:40.30]Drum of the voices, drum of the voices!
[78:42.04]He was just saying chill out, dude.
[79:03.72]Alright, we gotta keep going this way.
[79:04.82]Dude, he was just saying chill out, man.
[79:16.14]SpongeBob voice?
[79:20.48]You mean the guy doing happy, happy, happy?
[79:29.40]Look around.
[79:30.06]Okay.
[79:40.02]Examine.
[79:40.50]Ooh, what's this?
[79:41.16]The statue of a human female bears witness to the monstrosity that fills the room.
[79:53.76]Somebody puking?
[80:00.16]Big up!
[80:07.62]Fool!
[80:08.90]You should have run!
[80:10.94]Instead you will die!
[80:13.28]Where is the essence of Mantarok?
[80:23.17]Do I use it to zap him?
[80:27.22]Where is it?
[80:29.64]I will not ask again, child.
[80:34.58]Very well then.
[80:37.00]You will succumb to the horrors of oblivion.
[80:41.56]Do it.
[80:58.94]Chapter complete.
[81:03.48]That was kind of a weird transition.
[81:09.64]Candles are here now.
[81:10.32]Alright, let's see the candles.
[81:16.19]Small shrine of candles.
[81:17.37]Their placement appears to be very deliberate, corresponding to the etchings on the table and an illustration upon the wall.
[81:25.15]Etching on the table, illustration on the wall.
[81:27.69]I already know what it is.
[81:30.48]Ready?
[81:30.64]I already got it.
[81:37.42]I remember things.
[81:42.32]The cigar?
[81:43.13]With the correct sequence of candles being lit, a hidden panel opens.
[81:45.91]There is a message tube.
[81:48.53]Found the message tube.
[81:52.65]What does the message say?
[81:55.01]An antique leather-bound message tube, the kind used to transport sealed message scrolls.
[81:59.35]It's unopened.
[82:03.09]Alright, chapter entitled, Suspicious of Conspiracy.
[82:19.54]Your presence is welcomed, Majesty.
[82:22.98]As always, I am honored.
[82:25.26]Our dealings are a pleasure to us both, ma'am.
[82:31.91]As do we all.
[82:33.55]What is this flow you wish to discuss with us?
[82:37.91]My concern is with the other ancients.
[82:40.45]Ulioth.
[82:42.49]Should they unite with Mantarok?
[82:44.31]He would doubtlessly possess enough power.
[82:47.23]As darkness abhors light and light abhors dark.
[82:53.42]The others will not, cannot join forces.
[82:56.80]Mantarok.
[83:06.10]As has been foretold.
[83:06.60]I was unaware.
[83:33.65]With this in place, my guardians will be hard-pressed to perform the functions you require.
[83:42.36]For your own schemes, Pius.
[83:45.50]Think of your future.
[83:48.00]Then Charlemagne will be removed from the picture.
[83:51.40]Make sure.
[83:56.65]Explain like I'm... Oh no, that's EU moment.
[83:59.97]I thought he was doing explain like I'm 5 moment.
[84:06.32]Okay, after the chapter page is removed, the message tube is no longer needed.
[84:16.62]Alex discards it.
[84:17.44]Okay, so we get to hear about our god.
[84:20.09]Okay, cool.
[84:22.27]Cool.
[84:25.39]So now we gotta find another chapter page.
[84:27.87]Which... What do I have?
[84:36.35]Wait, isn't this the save the game?
[84:37.63]Yeah.
[84:42.23]Remember to save.
[84:46.76]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[84:52.16]Okay, so...
[84:57.67]I already did this one, right?
[84:58.83]Did I not do this one?
[85:04.10]Oh, you discard it.
[85:05.86]From my research, it is apparent that the endeavors of mankind are mere puppetry at the hands of the ancients.
[85:15.15]Whenever a king vows reform...
[85:18.00]The ancients move quickly to stifle it.
[85:21.45]Sorry for that.
[85:21.97]Apologies for that image I made with the fix.
[85:24.33]It was incorrect.
[85:25.05]No, it's fine.
[85:25.87]It's alright.
[85:26.81]I'm just kidding around.
[85:27.76]Don't worry, man.
[85:39.14]But you stopped reading it?
[85:40.98]I fixed it already, I did.
[85:43.00]Yeah, no, I got it.
[85:44.12]We would have already seen it.
[86:09.20]Don't read that.
[86:13.26]Okay, quick, quick poll.
[86:14.14]Would you open that ever again?
[86:15.54]Would you open that ever again?
[86:19.48]I wouldn't.
[86:20.92]Okay, and what do you do after that?
[86:23.40]Do you tell anybody?
[86:24.86]I'm not even sure I would tell my mother that happened.
[86:30.05]What do you even do with that thing?
[86:37.15]Destroy it?
[86:37.83]You can't destroy it.
[86:38.59]It's definitely too powerful to destroy.
[86:40.25]Burning it would just make whatever god angry that you burnt it.
[86:44.91]Holy shit, I almost punched this person.
[86:50.97]After Anthony briefly describes his mission, the monk informs him that Charlemagne was last seen in audience with the bishop in the visiting chamber.
[87:03.65]Is this why everyone was spamming for me to save the game?
[87:05.69]Because I was gonna punch somebody in the face and ruin everything?
[87:13.46]That's why.
[87:13.92]I get it.
[87:14.40]Okay.
[87:16.04]Thank you for the help.
[87:16.86]I appreciate it.
[87:17.38]Do I even have a punch?
[87:22.27]Uneral casket made from unfinished wood.
[87:23.85]It is not properly sealed.
[87:25.02]Should Anthony open it?
[87:26.62]Yeah.
[87:27.86]Alright, put the... Close it.
[87:29.52]Close it.
[87:29.80]Close it.
[87:30.00]Look how his body has been defiled.
[87:32.02]As if something has burst out from inside him.
[87:34.80]Here.
[87:51.40]Take this for your protection.
[87:53.54]And find the bishop.
[87:55.02]You must be informed of this horrible discovery.
[87:57.40]The same sword that every single one of us and all of our ancestors ever threw history.
[88:04.42]It's like the historic blade that's just passed down for 10,000 years, right?
[88:07.58]Yeah.
[88:09.18]The Scramasics.
[88:12.40]That sounds like me trying to say a word, and that's me saying it incorrectly.
[88:19.48]Like, that's me trying to say Sacramento, California.
[88:22.24]That's what I say and hear in my head.
[88:26.84]Uh, yeah, it's Scratchdomastics, California.
[88:29.20]I've been there before.
[88:31.71]It was cool.
[88:38.63]Oh, no.
[88:39.01]His brain.
[88:39.93]Okay.
[88:46.99]We must warn the others.
[88:50.82]I better equip that shit.
[88:58.32]What else can I do in here?
[88:59.06]I do have a map.
[89:02.22]I'm just realizing this now.
[89:06.45]Save Charlemagne.
[89:08.11]How?
[89:09.63]I think he's been dead for like seven or eight days.
[89:11.83]How am I supposed to save that guy?
[89:16.87]Awful voices emanate from inside the bishop's visiting chamber.
[89:20.26]However, the door is locked and Anthony will need the bishop's key to enter.
[89:24.36]Alright.
[89:27.80]Go find this key.
[89:30.34]The bishop's key.
[89:39.35]Go up.
[89:42.67]He's in the toilet?
[89:43.43]No, that's like his audience chamber.
[89:49.81]Now what?
[89:53.71]Silent Hill?
[89:57.34]Illya.
[89:57.76]Pius.
[90:05.36]Oh yeah, I destroyed his statue.
[90:15.80]Right on what appears to be a leathery hand lies a mysterious book that's bound in human skin.
[90:20.08]It beckons to you.
[90:25.26]Should Anthony claim the tomb of eternal darkness?
[90:35.41]He got it.
[90:41.35]Okay, I got the book.
[90:43.67]That was up there, apparently.
[90:50.39]But who wrote it?
[90:52.93]Yeah!
[90:54.57]Who wrote that?
[91:01.09]That's a weird thing to think about.
[91:03.59]Who wrote the Tome of Eternal Darkness?
[91:09.11]Whoever wrote it, it was being dictated by somebody else.
[91:14.72]Did, like, Satan write the book?
[91:17.38]Who actually wrote that book?
[91:18.46]Why would you write that book?
[91:22.11]It had to have been like dictated by some god.
[91:24.03]I guess, yeah.
[91:30.26]I did it- I wrote it for fun.
[91:31.26]Pick this up.
[91:35.54]I know that it's red, blue, green, red, blue, green, red, blue, green.
[91:43.75]Circle of power.
[91:45.79]Circles of power describe the amount of power that a spell will have.
[91:50.17]The more points within that circle, the stronger the spell will be.
[91:52.69]Spells are magical incantations that enhance a character's natural abilities.
[91:56.35]Okay, here's the spell list.
[91:59.51]It's an inventory of all the spell information.
[92:01.37]Okay.
[92:02.91]We've assigned a quick spell.
[92:07.89]Selecting this will allow the player to experiment with rune combinations and discover new spells.
[92:12.26]Okay, that's the inventory of all the components of the magical spells.
[92:17.90]And this is the quick spell.
[92:20.32]Alright, let's see.
[92:20.72]What do we have?
[92:21.10]A quick spell.
[92:21.64]Nothing.
[92:21.96]What do I have for spells?
[92:24.52]Nothing.
[92:25.16]New spell.
[92:26.08]Don't have enough components to make a new spell.
[92:28.24]What have I got?
[92:28.72]Back in there.
[92:32.08]Ruins.
[92:32.68]Circle of Power.
[92:33.42]Okay, like, what am I supposed to do with that?
[92:42.09]Ooh, what's this?
[92:44.83]Uh, there's one that can be moved.
[92:46.63]Always check the bookcases.
[92:47.71]Always.
[92:53.44]One spell, Andy?
[92:56.47]Sure.
[92:56.73]Uh-oh.
[93:04.47]What's that?
[93:10.01]Does that mean... Is he holding something?
[93:14.69]Did he eat that?
[93:15.79]What is that supposed to be?
[93:23.85]Put his arm up.
[93:30.41]I can't.
[93:30.79]I'm stuck in this room.
[93:39.17]Good.
[93:39.27]Alright.
[93:39.75]Hold on.
[93:40.03]I'm going to stop breathing a second.
[93:42.36]It's going to go.
[93:44.10]Right.
[93:44.98]Rest.
[93:45.28]Yeah.
[93:45.48]See.
[93:45.56]Alright.
[93:47.74]We're good.
[93:55.73]Magical Rune.
[93:56.57]Alright, so, yeah, I remember this.
[94:01.34]Yeah, you go, like, Roo, Roo, Parka, Parka, Roo, Parka, and it does something.
[94:07.74]I remember this.
[94:08.22]Yeah, okay, the key elements creating spells, you use them in different ways, okay.
[94:13.96]New spell, don't have enough.
[94:25.56]Weird how your brain just remembers those things.
[94:28.08]I haven't played this game in probably 20 years.
[94:29.34]Since it came out.
[94:32.09]I don't know why, but I know that.
[94:33.35]I know that rune.
[94:34.89]The way that they say it.
[94:37.13]It's a boomer alert.
[94:48.18]Haha.
[94:54.59]What's wrong with me?
[94:55.39]I need to drink some water.
[94:57.73]I look like me when I did the last green screen stream.
[95:06.40]This guy's fucking dehydrated.
[95:08.20]You good?
[95:34.70]well yeah weirdly we're just that's a weird thing to hold on to that's a stray I'm just gonna tell you that's a weird thing for you to know and hold on to for this long
[95:51.38]Ooh!
[96:22.55]Excuse me.
[96:29.17]Nice.
[96:30.63]I love two-handers.
[96:37.06]No, I'm not going to kill this guy.
[96:39.36]I know you all want to see it, but I'm not going to do it.
[96:42.52]Everybody thinks I'm just going to haul back and baseball swing that guy's head off.
[96:49.80]No, I made that mistake already.
[96:54.48]Please rotate.
[96:55.42]The area is dark and it's difficult to make out anything.
[97:04.51]Oh.
[97:05.77]Well.
[97:07.07]I can probably help that.
[97:12.44]Picked up the piece of broken green urn.
[97:14.42]There they are.
[97:16.36]Piece of broken green urn.
[97:17.82]Mix them together.
[97:25.05]Two thirds of a broken green urn.
[97:26.83]Okay, I need the rest of the pieces of it.
[97:30.03]Rip urn.
[97:31.29]Yep.
[97:31.49]Nothing to do with these boxes, right?
[97:37.87]Nope.
[97:38.05]Put the whole thing together.
[97:43.27]Broken green urn.
[97:44.29]Do I get glue?
[97:45.53]What else can I do with it?
[97:54.87]Another rune.
[97:58.13]Ooh.
[98:00.59]Magmor.
[98:01.15]Carpstone tablet.
[98:04.64]Okay, I got the magical codex.
[98:06.24]Codex?
[98:10.40]Runes cannot be misunderstood.
[98:12.08]Runes cannot be understood without a codex.
[98:14.40]Without a codex, runes in your possession will remain a mystery.
[98:18.70]Ah, right.
[98:19.20]Okay.
[98:19.50]Alright, we need to collect those.
[98:31.77]Okay, well he instantly died.
[98:32.91]Cool, thanks for the magical rune.
[98:38.33]There it is.
[98:38.71]Alright, so this is item.
[98:42.54]No new spells I need.
[98:43.32]I think three, right?
[98:46.56]Jeremy, it's the power of fire.
[98:56.68]Why is this happening to me?
[99:05.25]Burn.
[99:07.57]Man, this thing's awesome.
[99:08.85]Okay, this is, uh, let's see.
[99:14.72]Get rid of it.
[99:18.16]Ruins.
[99:19.88]Ulathath.
[99:20.86]Ulathath.
[99:21.79]Ulaoth.
[99:23.37]Ulyoth.
[99:28.19]I still alive?
[99:35.55]Red urn.
[99:36.51]Pick it up.
[99:36.79]Alright, I just have to fix the green one.
[99:44.65]Is there a quick weapon switch?
[99:46.59]Probably not.
[99:47.17]This game is from 2002.
[99:53.69]Disturbing rendition of a monster's devil.
[99:55.41]Can I drink?
[99:59.79]Urn, urn, urn, urn, urn.
[100:01.74]What is this?
[100:06.54]An aged tapestry hangs on the wall that is soiled from the dank atmosphere and the corruption about it.
[100:10.94]After I burn that, right?
[100:18.60]I really do feel like I'm playing Resident Evil having to go into the menu and switch weapons.
[100:36.26]Damn.
[100:36.94]That was two hits.
[100:37.68]That guy got... Wait.
[100:38.46]Finish him.
[100:39.12]He's a pair of legs.
[100:42.84]He's like the number munchers monster.
[100:44.92]Really?
[100:45.22]Do I have to finish him?
[100:46.07]Oh!
[100:58.17]It's annoying.
[101:00.79]I'm leaving.
[101:01.19]I don't know what that means.
[101:06.87]Okay.
[101:07.69]An iron plate in the floor is carved with three curious circles.
[101:12.16]Bright splashes have marred its pockmarked and worn surface.
[101:16.44]Three curious circles.
[101:20.08]That's where the urns go.
[101:23.62]Okay.
[101:23.90]What is this one?
[101:30.58]Okay.
[101:30.74]We got this one.
[101:33.70]Antorbock.
[101:35.44]Project.
[101:37.86]We need to find Yuliothe.
[101:45.11]Amongst the books on the table is an ancient scroll of what appears to be paper.
[101:49.79]Enchant item, spell scroll.
[101:53.69]Ha!
[101:54.15]Through this function, the player can examine the content of each spell scroll that has been acquired.
[102:02.48]Okay.
[102:05.24]Wow.
[102:07.63]Uh, the note reads, that which is broken shall be fixed.
[102:10.07]That which is dull will be sharp.
[102:12.41]That is the nature of the enchant item magic.
[102:18.17]The spell requires the Antorbark and Magormor runes.
[102:21.46]I have them both.
[102:21.92]Alright, let's make the spell.
[102:25.04]New spell.
[102:25.52]What are you talking about?
[102:26.80]Okay.
[102:34.20]Antorbark and Magormor.
[102:37.83]Do I not have it?
[102:38.31]I got it!
[102:41.33]What the hell?
[102:52.49]Is this open?
[102:54.77]The bishop passed through this secret door, there has to be a way to get through it.
[103:01.26]Shit.
[103:07.95]How do I get through it?
[103:08.55]Do I have anything?
[103:12.79]Oh, the urns, urns, urns, but I don't have... Hold on.
[103:18.95]Although the urn appears to sit correctly in place on the pressure plate, it does not appear to be heavy enough to depress it.
[103:26.25]Yeah, I gotta fix the urn.
[103:27.77]No, I don't.
[103:29.67]What?
[103:33.03]Oh.
[103:36.08]Oh, god damn it.
[103:37.38]Okay, hold on.
[103:37.92]While fumbling around, the urn slips from Anthony's stiff fingers, dashing itself onto fragments on the floor.
[103:50.00]Cool.
[103:52.95]Wait, there's a rune in there.
[103:56.73]Oh, alright.
[103:57.61]I found it.
[104:02.55]Nice.
[104:02.73]This allows players to cast spells that have been found or researched.
[104:06.84]And you can assign this.
[104:09.52]Cool.
[104:10.62]Yes, thank god.
[104:11.04]Alignment.
[104:30.17]Spells can be cast directly from this book.
[104:32.84]Or from the quick spell.
[104:33.66]You have to press up.
[104:35.08]Yeah, okay.
[104:36.66]There it is.
[104:38.98]Magic meter.
[104:39.82]This meter represents the character's magical energy.
[104:42.97]The level will get lower.
[104:43.87]This meter regenerates whenever the character is in motion.
[104:46.09]Alright, let's go.
[104:49.43]So, check this.
[104:52.72]Go cast that spell.
[104:57.59]Nice.
[104:59.43]Ooh, the voice.
[105:12.81]Is this the voice?
[105:19.08]Oh.
[105:21.26]Ooh.
[105:22.62]Oh, three.
[105:29.10]Is that not enough to depress it?
[105:33.07]What are you talking about?
[105:33.83]I did it in the wrong spot?
[105:44.35]Oh, because it has water in it.
[105:45.85]Okay.
[105:47.16]Shit.
[105:57.66]Wow, your character looks dead.
[105:58.68]Yeah, I know.
[106:05.17]I love that sound.
[106:08.83]Sound of just like pee filling a jar.
[106:11.71]Or like water pouring into a glass.
[106:13.25]ASMR.
[106:16.93]ASMR.
[106:28.47]ASMR piss video.
[106:30.95]That would be kind of weird.
[106:34.37]That would take you a long time to film that video.
[106:40.79]It would take like 3 or 4 weeks to get a 3 or 4 or 5 minute video.
[106:50.00]Get 10 minutes of pee content ASMR.
[106:52.04]That's like 4 or 5 days of drinking food and water.
[106:58.73]What?
[107:05.50]Take one day?
[107:06.56]No, it would not.
[107:07.42]Ten full minutes of peeing?
[107:13.68]Oh shit, boss spike.
[107:34.79]He cut his head off.
[107:35.33]Alright, I got the key.
[107:47.30]Shit.
[107:49.46]Dude, I didn't even kill.
[107:52.00]I killed this guy's clothes.
[108:03.68]Detail.
[108:04.10]Alright, shrine to a god that bespeaks of an ancient evil.
[108:06.81]Alright, now I got the key.
[108:10.61]Back to the front door.
[108:20.46]Save the game.
[108:21.24]Fuck.
[108:25.58]I can't.
[108:26.16]Okay, just don't lose.
[108:42.01]Don't lose and you'll win.
[108:42.77]Yeah.
[108:43.71]Exactly.
[108:48.46]Characters just turn.
[108:49.52]Yeah.
[108:49.96]I don't know.
[108:59.06]I keep... No, no, no.
[108:59.89]I want to kill this guy.
[109:02.41]Finish.
[109:04.23]Alright.
[109:10.31]To the bishop's door.
[109:18.77]They do a lot.
[109:19.63]I don't care.
[109:22.17]Little scorpions.
[109:23.13]Great.
[109:31.91]What?
[109:41.32]I don't remember this shit.
[109:45.76]Heck, I need purple.
[109:46.24]Oh, I guess I'm good?
[110:21.13]Oh, that's to refill your sanity.
[110:22.63]Did I die?
[110:23.23]I don't think I did.
[110:33.81]Oh, I'm back.
[110:49.98]Alright, well.
[110:51.67]I refilled this entity.
[110:52.41]Let me save it.
[110:57.42]This is a little side thing.
[110:59.42]Oh.
[111:01.64]Crappers have no eyes, but can sense sound very well.
[111:04.02]If Anthony can sneak past them, they won't be trouble.
[111:10.33]Oh, just be quiet.
[111:11.47]I have no idea where they are.
[111:27.06]I can't believe Jerma STOLE this game.
[111:30.96]Right next to me.
[111:33.10]In fact, I think the Wii is still turned on.
[111:48.29]No, it's off.
[111:48.85]I got it.
[111:49.11]It's off.
[111:49.47]It's off.
[111:52.95]Wasting power.
[111:53.70]I don't know.
[111:54.24]I just looked over.
[111:54.78]It's a red light.
[111:55.94]It means it's not on.
[111:59.30]Oh, by the way, I want to make sure everyone knows this.
[112:00.81]Tomorrow is DLC movie night.
[112:04.63]That's tomorrow.
[112:06.91]Doing it somewhere around noon.
[112:09.67]11 to 12.
[112:11.03]The idea.
[112:14.11]There is a ton of videos.
[112:18.67]I don't know how much we're going to get through, but we're going to see how much we can get through in like five to six hours.
[112:28.80]Alright, I got the key.
[112:33.72]This is not community content night.
[112:36.53]This is only the DLC movie night.
[112:46.26]I really don't look good.
[112:47.12]This is... I look like shit.
[112:55.86]12 hours or Riot.
[112:57.56]I can't sit here for 12 hours.
[113:12.64]Boss fight?
[113:13.14]Uh-huh.
[113:14.68]Alright.
[113:15.56]I'm working slow.
[113:16.46]I'm just over encumbering.
[113:28.39]Cut his other arm off.
[113:30.01]Cut his other arm off.
[113:31.89]Cut the other arm off.
[113:34.53]Cut his other arm off.
[113:42.47]Good.
[113:43.73]Looks like you're using voice commands.
[113:51.88]It would have been bad if he got up.
[113:57.84]Okay.
[114:06.24]It was sexy pose.
[114:11.62]Jesus!
[114:12.34]I'm surprised this guy's still standing.
[114:21.25]You know what, I'm so pissed that Jermyn didn't get the sexy pose from that game.
[114:35.70]I don't think you are that mad about it.
[114:37.10]I think you just remembered because we just started talking about it and like two years have gone by and you remembered two years ago when you were annoyed.
[114:45.77]You're not still mad about that.
[114:46.81]Go.
[114:56.12]Go.
[115:11.23]You are a fool for trying to save him, Anthony.
[115:14.89]His fate was decided centuries ago, as is the fate of this world.
[115:21.34]Yeah, I guess it is.
[115:22.42]Despite your faith, there is little to save you from the power of Xenoblade.
[115:38.00]Yeah, the book got too scary.
[115:40.18]I'm done reading today.
[115:44.01]I don't like this part.
[115:45.01]I'm gonna stop.
[115:54.97]What else is in this room that I can fuck around with?
[116:04.60]Go back down, right?
[116:10.66]Save the game.
[116:15.52]Wait, I can fix broken stuff now, right?
[116:19.64]Every time we read in the book, we learn something in the real world.
[116:23.77]You got stick bugged.
[116:26.01]Shut up.
[116:27.91]Stop.
[116:29.21]Do not.
[116:30.37]Unbelievable.
[116:38.02]Unbelievable.
[116:38.94]I refuse to laugh at that, but it was funny and it's annoying me how funny it was.
[116:45.67]Somebody just donate like $10 and do that?
[116:47.47]Or what?
[116:47.71]Leave.
[117:06.65]No, I wanna leave.
[117:09.85]No, you're not coming in.
[117:22.14]Get the door.
[117:22.78]No!
[117:23.12]Get stick bugged.
[117:27.18]Oh my fucking god, I'm so mad at that.
[117:34.33]Come back another day!
[117:39.72]It's fucking instant messenger.
[117:42.04]Why is it... I don't even... It's so... Whatever.
[117:48.52]Benjamin Franklin.
[118:08.06]It's too dark in here to do anything.
[118:09.58]Perhaps the circuit has been broken.
[118:16.91]Bedroom.
[118:19.77]Chapter page has been hastily stashed behind the frame.
[118:23.45]Ooh, the gift of forever.
[118:26.91]Oh, sick, oh, sick.
[118:30.21]Cigarettes, ammo, yep.
[118:40.06]Let's read it.
[118:44.94]Chapter four.
[118:47.25]Modern psychology offers only unproven theories.
[118:51.45]Some see them as the meaningless tossing and turning of a brain settling into a restful sleep.
[118:57.97]Others see them as laden with symbols of our unconscious desires.
[119:02.93]To still others, dreams represent the upwelling of the archetypes, normally hidden deep within the recesses of the human collective unconscious.
[119:12.60]Of one thing I am certain.
[119:14.88]Play Riddick.
[119:15.64]After a brush with the ancients, our dreams metamorphosize into nightmares.
[119:20.48]I played it.
[119:21.04]I already did it, man.
[119:23.57]Alright, this is 565 AD in Persia.
[119:37.67]Saw?
[119:38.01]Actually, I have Saw 2.
[119:40.33]Here.
[119:41.79]I have implored you for years.
[119:44.64]Yet you ignore all my advances.
[119:48.76]You dominate my dreams.
[119:51.38]And I can think of nothing else.
[119:54.16]I fear I desire you many hundred times more than you love me.
[120:00.05]My life has become a waking dream, Kareem.
[120:05.36]For weeks, I have dreamed of an ancient treasure so precious that it changes all life around it.
[120:12.84]It must be mine, Kareem.
[120:16.04]If you truly desire me, as you say, then you will find this for me.
[120:23.12]Bring this treasure to me, and I will be yours.
[120:28.26]Both of our dreams will come true.
[120:31.98]I need nothing more than you.
[120:35.72]You have enthralled me to the point where I can think of nothing else.
[120:41.09]Promise, if I leave, you will not forget about me.
[120:46.31]You need not worry.
[120:48.07]I desire nothing more than the treasure that you seek.
[120:52.66]Leave now, Karim, and I shall await you.
[120:56.36]Karim.
[121:04.50]Time for us to do some puzzles!
[121:12.19]Fell for it.
[121:12.79]The end.
[121:24.38]No, it's not the end.
[121:25.94]It's only the beginning.
[121:33.09]This guy's gonna get up.
[121:38.99]Uh oh.
[121:39.19]Here are all the statues.
[121:39.97]There's a new one.
[121:40.55]Anthony!
[122:02.13]Ours is gonna be right here.
[122:04.85]Very, very soon.
[122:06.01]Do you claim the tomb of eternal darkness?
[122:19.03]The best part about games back in like 2000, 1999, 2002, whatever, is this is a Mario no.
[122:27.04]You know, it's just like, oh, really Mario?
[122:29.92]No.
[122:32.75]Doesn't do anything.
[122:33.77]You just actually, like, step away.
[122:40.33]Funny if it did something else.
[122:44.19]Tome of Eternal Darkness.
[122:55.32]Tome.
[122:56.48]The tomb.
[122:56.92]Why can I not move?
[122:58.01]Am I already insane?
[123:04.54]Am I actually trapped in the corner?
[123:12.81]Kill.
[123:13.57]Kill.
[123:14.61]No, don't climb down.
[123:16.41]Climb up.
[123:20.26]I want to get my sanity back.
[123:32.94]Tome is one of my fanfics.
[123:34.42]Don't read it, please.
[123:35.42]I lost a bet with a friend.
[123:36.74]Okay.
[123:49.20]Watch out for green.
[123:52.56]I lost a bet with a... A bet of what?
[123:54.52]That you had to write?
[123:56.77]A story?
[123:57.39]I don't know what that means.
[124:00.40]Alright, a statuette vaguely resembling a man stands atop a low pedestal.
[124:04.35]Pick it up.
[124:13.53]Read that guy's fanfic.
[124:16.20]So I'm telling you guys something interesting here.
[124:17.98]I'm telling you.
[124:19.84]I've decided that I'm going to keep track of the second I wake up the dream that I had the night before.
[124:30.54]And then we are going to put on kind of weird, scary music two or three months from now.
[124:38.10]And we're going to do a, I'm going to read you all the dreams I've had over the last two, three months.
[124:46.25]I want to keep, I want to keep a dream journal and tell you about all of them for like four hours.
[125:03.96]Vinny does that?
[125:06.04]Because Vinny's fucking... Vinny's a hilarious dude that, like, knows how to do comedy.
[125:10.17]So, yeah.
[125:17.13]I got a new rune, though.
[125:23.82]What is it?
[125:27.66]I don't know what it is.
[125:28.36]Alright, I need H.
[125:35.97]Wait, anything else in this room?
[125:43.65]Or better yet, just commission out animators to animate them all.
[125:47.97]Just give them exact details of what happens.
[125:50.47]And I don't even tell the story, we just watch them.
[125:58.86]It'll be like two hours.
[126:09.16]And you guys can try to break down what the hell was wrong with my brain that night.
[126:15.23]Oh lord.
[126:16.71]Starting to go a little bit crazy.
[126:20.25]Go pee already?
[126:22.37]Give me a second.
[126:23.35]How do you know that I have to go pee?
[126:28.31]Alright, statuette.
[126:40.68]Codex.
[126:41.06]What's this one for?
[126:45.48]This is the codex for Zeloteth.
[126:49.15]Okay.
[126:51.49]Oh, I have two.
[126:52.21]I got two statues now.
[126:53.33]What do I do with them?
[126:53.85]Should I put the other one on it?
[126:59.38]Oh, let me switch it up.
[127:04.14]Can't use that.
[127:06.46]Shit.
[127:07.88]Go piss now.
[127:08.52]No.
[127:09.16]Just wait.
[127:16.58]the door?
[127:20.17]Hmm.
[127:20.41]You'd have to pay animation wages for weeks.
[127:29.25]That's fine.
[127:39.14]Go to the bathroom.
[127:43.28]No.
[127:44.30]I don't have to go to the bathroom right now.
[127:50.18]Alright, what do I do with these statues?
[127:55.82]Is there a place I could put them here?
[127:57.02]No.
[128:03.85]You're shitting yourself.
[128:04.81]You're shitting yourself.
[128:05.71]You're shitting yourself.
[128:06.59]I am not shitting myself.
[128:08.17]I am not.
[128:09.25]It's not happening.
[128:12.53]I told you I have to pee.
[128:13.62]I don't know where you guys are getting shit from.
[128:23.22]You're shitting yourself, you're shitting yourself, you're shitting yourself.
[128:25.71]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[128:30.13]What do I do with these statues?
[128:43.50]You promised you would shit your pants on stream like five months ago.
[128:48.96]I don't, I did not do that.
[128:50.90]I did not promise that.
[128:52.06]Why would I promise something like that?
[128:53.46]That's the stupidest thing to promise.
[129:03.52]Alright, what do I do?
[129:04.54]I'm stuck.
[129:05.22]How can I be stuck?
[129:06.10]These puzzles are not hard.
[129:08.53]Or, statuette, use.
[129:10.21]I can't put the, the, this one here?
[129:21.37]What is this?
[129:24.01]I'm not watching videos right now.
[129:28.44]Beatrice!

[130:21.68]Seriously.
[130:22.22]A crudely sculpted statue.
[130:26.92]It seems perfectly heavy for its size.
[130:28.75]But where do I press them?
[130:31.59]Oh!
[130:31.69]Oh!
[130:35.52]Save and go to the bathroom.

[132:24.35]There's no experience points.
[132:26.65]I'm fucking leaving.
[132:42.38]So what did that do for me?
[132:48.77]This thing went up.
[132:49.75]What does that do for me?
[132:51.35]Does that do anything for me?
[132:53.65]It didn't do anything.

[136:55.70]I can now wield two Tollwars simultaneously.
[137:00.34]Well, that's pretty cool.
[137:01.34]This is going to sound weird, and maybe some of you will get what I'm trying to say here.

[139:36.92]No.
[139:37.06]Can I put my sword in here?
[139:38.62]Nope.
[140:02.26]It's my favorite toothpaste flavor.
[140:04.17]Just cool, refreshing mint.
[140:05.47]Come on, dude.
[140:14.77]Dorito.
[140:28.68]It's frozen me.
[140:39.40]Get away!
[140:48.93]Cut his arm off, dude!
[140:50.61]Do I have a heal?
[140:55.87]Wait, it was just playing the beginning cutscene.
[141:00.74]Okay.
[141:01.40]What?
[141:10.08]Did he kill me?
[141:11.48]No, I'm okay.
[141:12.10]I'm alright.
[141:12.40]I'm alright.
[141:12.84]I'm alright.
[141:13.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[141:16.89]Why can he fit down here?
[141:17.97]I did...
[141:41.81]I do it again?
[141:42.27]Get the fucking book.
[141:50.05]Hey!
[141:52.03]Wait.
[141:54.17]What's that noise?
[141:54.81]What's with the birds?
[141:58.47]No, I want to go there!
[141:59.13]I want to go there!
[141:59.53]I want to go there!
[142:04.84]I want the sanity.
[142:06.58]Yes, green.
[142:10.36]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[142:21.18]Ah.
[142:22.50]There we are.
[142:23.62]Back to normal.
[142:32.25]This game sucks.
[142:33.03]Play potty racers.
[142:37.63]Um.
[142:41.66]Somebody said true.
[142:43.18]True what?
[142:43.64]Alright.
[142:48.90]I'm going to kill this guy.
[142:53.41]Wait till he does this big charge move.
[142:54.73]There it is.
[142:55.19]Gotta go for the right arm first.
[143:07.32]Fuck, I got greedy.
[143:11.50]I'm trying to target the arm.
[143:16.04]Target the arm!
[143:19.22]Oh my god, target his fucking arm.
[143:30.36]Sick parry.
[143:41.90]Am I doing?
[143:43.74]I'm doing alright.
[143:44.22]How are you doing?
[143:45.32]Alright.
[143:51.14]Did I get a heal?
[143:58.65]Mmm, I got this these two don't have them yet.
[144:02.19]Alright, let's go.
[144:04.39]Am I doing on health?
[144:08.91]What's the spell for you to go to the bathroom?
[144:19.98]That's a great question.
[144:21.94]It's called when I get to the end of this chapter.
[144:33.71]Can you order the pizza for me tomorrow night?
[144:36.39]I cannot order a pizza for you.
[144:44.26]That's the one I just got.

[145:16.21]What does it do?
[145:20.51]What did I just recover?
[145:28.79]To the end of the chapter.
[145:30.53]I'm fine.
[145:38.21]It recovers mana.
[145:40.41]Oh.

[148:58.14]Fuck.
[148:59.38]Alright, when was the last time I saved the game?
[149:23.41]That's not good.
[149:32.46]How far away was this?
[149:33.20]10 minutes ago?
[149:38.50]Alright, I'll fucking speedrun this.
[149:43.36]Alright, alright, alright.
[149:44.41]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[149:45.05]I'll be right back.
[152:13.68]How you doing?
[152:23.23]Broke his turkey dick again.
[152:24.55]Something like that.
[152:36.34]But not really.
[152:39.54]I forgot about that already.
[152:51.45]What happened?
[152:59.82]I lost communication with the controller?
[153:01.30]Oh, I'm good.
[153:04.90]That was weird.
[153:10.08]Where the hell did I end up here?
[153:16.74]I don't remember.
[153:17.18]How far away was this?
[153:18.54]This seems like a long time ago.
[153:19.88]What was the last thing I just did?
[153:25.24]No, it's not that far.
[153:26.10]It's alright.
[153:32.17]I'll go quick.
[153:41.46]Set that heal recovery spell.
[153:43.54]Okay.
[153:50.29]Sign it.
[153:54.28]There it is.
[153:55.22]Save, save, save, save, save.
[154:14.05]I gotta do this whole room again.
[154:15.07]That sucks, but at least it's right here.
[154:30.17]It's so loud.
[154:31.05]Alright.
[154:33.34]Hold on, I'll get it.
[154:34.90]I'll get it.
[154:47.33]I missed the vroomer.
[154:49.77]Aw, don't make me reminisce about the vroomer.
[154:51.95]I miss him too.
[155:01.07]I get it?
[155:10.70]I miss getting visibly angry every 30 to 45 minutes every single day on stream.
[155:30.40]I love having my whole day ruined.
[155:31.72]I love lying in bed.
[155:34.17]At 2 o'clock in the morning.
[155:38.95]And having my eyes rip open.
[155:41.75]Because I hear a... And I think that somebody's about to drive into my fucking house.
[155:47.94]Man.
[155:51.36]I missed that.
[156:06.56]One of these guys turns into one of those things.
[156:08.00]I got lucky.
[156:14.40]It's not this one.
[156:15.00]I really wish there was a dodge.
[156:24.86]That's the next set, right?
[156:25.90]It's the next set.
[156:29.50]You don't realize what you had until it was gone.
[156:33.42]Now you're right.
[156:47.71]Did I get it off?
[156:50.28]No.
[156:51.90]Okay, I got the rune.
[156:55.24]Now I just have to get away from the sanity thing.
[157:00.02]These guys with the sanity bullshit.
[157:01.96]Why?
[157:02.38]Die!
[157:19.59]Kill it before it kills me!
[157:21.01]Okay, good.
[157:30.29]That's it, right?
[157:30.87]It can't be another one.
[157:33.21]We're good.
[157:36.87]Is my sanity too low to save it?
[157:37.99]Thank god.
[157:45.83]Couldn't have picked the green thing.
[157:48.86]I did it on accident.
[157:50.46]I didn't even mean to.
[157:51.24]Game sucks playing Nintendogs instead.
[158:00.91]I don't have Nintendogs.
[158:05.71]I'm sorry, man.
[158:14.66]Kind of fucked up.
[158:21.72]Alright, the blade's in the slot.
[158:22.50]It feels like pushback.
[158:23.52]The magic of the blade does not fit the lock.
[158:28.34]Really?
[158:31.22]Why?
[158:31.92]Really?
[158:32.24]So now what?
[158:32.62]Now what am I supposed to do?
[158:34.22]I have to enchant it?
[158:40.85]So now it's blue.
[158:55.76]Isn't it a green lock?
[159:06.31]I need to enchant it with green.
[159:07.61]Alright, hold on.
[159:11.39]How do I do that?
[159:11.97]Okay, new spell.
[159:14.77]Green.
[159:17.63]Oh, shit.
[159:21.08]Okay, there it is.
[159:21.86]And she discovered the enchant item spell.
[159:24.14]Green.
[159:24.34]Green.
[159:38.11]Alright.
[159:39.67]Take a green recover, too.
[159:51.25]That's smart, isn't it?
[159:51.99]I'll do that right now.
[159:53.11]Okay, new spell.
[159:58.23]Green.
[160:01.35]Self.
[160:03.49]Absorb.

[160:12.36]Enchant.
[160:13.02]Assign.
[160:15.18]Green.

[160:18.46]Oh no!
[160:26.87]There.
[160:33.14]Ah, that's good.
[160:33.80]Do it again.
[160:36.68]Again.
[160:44.22]That's very, very handy.
[160:45.40]Okay, save it.
[160:47.84]I forget this entire game.
[160:49.06]Why are you not letting the insanity effects happen?
[160:58.24]ResidentSleeper.
[161:00.68]Why is this door not opening?
[161:13.30]ResidentSleeper no insanity effects ResidentSleeper Yeah, you know I guess you're right yeah, I think about it The one selling point of this game is the game fucks with you all the time But you guys aren't even seeing the selling point of the game
[161:37.96]I can't make a red one, can I?
[161:39.28]Alright, breathe for a second.
[161:53.93]Game sucks, you're too sane.
[161:55.49]Too much sanity.
[161:56.37]Yeah!
[162:11.53]Oh shit, this is bad.
[162:15.01]Can I- I need- I gotta heal with this little locket thing.
[162:19.21]At least one more time.
[162:26.24]Shoot me through walls?
[162:26.92]Are you fucking kidding me?
[162:35.56]Just go, I'm- who cares?
[162:37.72]Just go down the- I don't care.

[162:49.53]Alright, so... Can I put something on here?
[162:52.18]Let's go.
[163:00.00]Let's put the Necronomicon on here.
[163:11.24]You're playing too good.
[163:12.36]I am not playing good.
[163:15.68]I'm not playing too good.
[163:16.88]I have to save it.
[163:28.93]Shit.
[163:31.51]Shit, shit, shit.
[163:32.25]I have to play good.
[163:32.87]Shit.
[163:51.75]He's too talented.
[163:52.87]Hey.
[164:02.66]He's doing this on purpose.
[164:03.82]What, he's playing good on purpose?
[164:05.88]It's usually the other way around.
[164:07.82]Pretend or riot.
[164:10.28]No!
[164:10.70]That's not how this works!
[164:14.12]He's doing good on purpose.
[164:19.72]Of course I am.
[164:20.64]I'm trying to win.
[164:28.52]Start pretending.
[164:30.56]Holy shit.
[164:44.82]Look, I'm doing good.
[164:47.81]Start pretending.
[164:48.75]Start pretending.
[164:55.19]Finally.
[164:55.63]Are we almost done with this wave of enemies thing?
[165:00.75]Hurry up.
[165:01.31]More.
[165:02.07]More funnies.
[165:02.99]Pretend.
[165:04.27]Alright.
[165:04.65]Fine.
[165:05.21]Fine.
[165:05.55]If that's what you want.
[165:09.15]No.
[165:09.43]I don't.
[165:09.81]No.
[165:09.97]I don't care.
[165:10.81]I have to be good.
[165:11.41]I have to play good.
[165:12.05]I'm gonna die in a second.
[165:21.63]That was so bad.
[165:28.19]I hate these little guys!
[165:29.15]How did that miss?
[165:39.83]Shit!
[165:44.04]How did that not land contact on his head?
[165:56.57]Stop pretending.
[165:57.51]Stop pretending.
[165:58.51]Start pretending.
[165:59.23]Stop pretending.
[166:00.03]You guys are fucking crazy.
[166:10.44]Actually bad.
[166:11.86]Laugh out loud.
[166:13.44]That's what you guys want.
[166:16.94]You want to be able to write... Bad.
[166:19.71]Oh, he's bad.
[166:24.74]Not today.
[166:26.61]It's my turn to be good today, not today.
[166:28.57]Alright.
[166:38.76]Do it good.
[166:39.66]Play good.
[166:54.24]What's this shit?
[166:54.80]What's he doing?
[166:56.47]What are they doing?
[166:58.75]What are they doing?
[167:00.91]What are they doing?
[167:10.86]Okay, here we go.
[167:12.04]Go to the bathroom.
[167:14.78]No, not this again.
[167:22.25]I could just Google a playthrough.
[167:24.71]Keep pretending.
[167:29.63]Yeah, I guess you could.
[167:30.69]Google the ending of the game.
[167:33.21]Thank you!
[167:57.49]Just Google the ending.
[167:59.31]Yeah, you could Google anything.
[168:01.05]Save it here.
[168:05.61]It actually would be funny if you did that as a joke.
[168:14.14]No, I don't want to Google the ending of the game because... No, I'm... It's wild how this game is only one year younger than me.
[168:27.69]Yeah, that is insane.
[168:28.41]Alright, should I go blue?
[168:38.22]I'm going to enchant this thing blue.
[168:40.80]Alright.
[168:52.63]Enchant item.
[168:53.95]Cast blue.
[168:59.14]These are purple, right?
[168:59.94]Does that matter?
[169:00.38]Come on, dude.
[169:09.13]Do I have to finish every single one of them?
[169:15.37]I really don't want to.
[169:30.44]Sometimes I think about just how old I am, guys.
[169:34.42]Forget about, oh wow, this game's only one year younger than me.
[169:36.84]Every day I wake up and I just go... 35 this year.
[169:43.65]This feels wrong to say, doesn't it?
[169:45.05]I turned 35 this year.
[169:51.74]35 is one of those ages that when you're like 17, 18, 19, you just never see yourself as a 35-year-old.
[169:58.92]What am I going to be like when I'm older?
[170:01.24]When I'm 50, when I'm 40.
[170:02.60]Nobody ever thinks about when they're like 30 or 35.
[170:04.40]You always skip.
[170:11.93]I do.
[170:12.47]Maybe some of you do.
[170:13.15]You know what's crazy?
[170:21.77]35 was always the age that I thought was like the old wise teacher.
[170:27.08]I'm going to die again.
[170:27.98]I'm stuck in the corner.
[170:33.44]Please move.
[170:34.89]What the fuck?
[170:37.37]I'm gonna die again.
[170:39.11]I'm going to die again.
[170:56.26]Get off!
[170:56.84]Come on!
[170:59.76]I was just waiting for him and he jumped on my face.
[171:09.18]Of course he does that move twice in a row.
[171:15.48]Why would you read this with a skull?
[171:17.00]The human skull facing you.
[171:21.66]That doesn't do- There's no reason for you to do that.
[171:28.69]Replace that with like a bowl of pretzels.
[171:30.45]Like what are you fucking stupid?
[171:42.02]Pretty good pretending.
[171:43.12]Yeah.
[171:46.97]Alright.
[171:47.85]Can I refill this?
[171:48.87]Am I just... Is it over?
[171:52.19]Am I just gonna lose?
[171:53.51]Forever?
[171:53.83]Oscar.
[172:07.02]Oscar.
[172:10.10]I need health, but I don't know any healing spells.
[172:17.45]I don't, right?
[172:22.43]I don't have any red ones.
[172:27.45]Just can't get hit.
[172:39.24]I don't even care about killing him with an execute.
[172:43.12]I'll just continue to be like this.
[172:45.40]He'll die eventually, right?
[172:46.26]You made my day better?
[172:50.08]Well, thanks for stopping by.
[172:51.06]I hope your day goes good.
[172:54.91]It continues to.
[172:56.35]Can I save it here?
[173:04.79]No.
[173:05.49]You can't save in combat.
[173:20.29]No one said that.
[173:23.03]Making up compliments now.
[173:24.37]Making up, like, things that people say that are good.
[173:26.51]Hey, like, nice job.
[173:28.56]Hey, you're making my day by making that up.
[173:31.18]That'd be very strange if I was.
[173:44.02]Come on!
[173:44.80]Kill him!
[173:48.80]Hi.
[174:18.37]Alright, I don't think I made it this far last time, did I?
[174:21.05]No, it's this exact part right here.
[174:36.07]Shit!
[174:43.71]Oh my god, you little shit!
[174:47.95]How did that not hit him?
[174:50.27]The sword went through his body.
[174:54.12]This is a fucking huge guy.
[174:55.80]What?
[175:11.51]My controls are backwards right now.
[175:16.99]Get away from me!
[175:17.78]No, please!
[175:21.02]No, please don't kill me!
[175:24.32]Run away from him!
[175:26.62]Run away from him.
[175:29.84]Okay, wait!
[175:37.37]This is not where I can even go.
[175:38.87]What the fuck, dude?
[175:40.65]I need full health.
[175:44.15]I didn't want to get stuck in the hallway with him because I'm just guaranteed to die.
[175:47.23]Oh my god.
[175:51.39]How are you supposed to do this?
[175:54.99]Just use the torch?
[176:06.33]Use the small swords.
[176:07.57]Fuck.
[176:13.99]I've not been in the same room for two hours.
[176:16.54]Stop gaslighting everybody.
[176:18.02]Okay.
[176:27.20]Give me the torch.
[176:29.94]We're gonna use torch only.
[176:38.13]This got so greedy.
[176:54.07]Gaslight him to believe he shit himself.
[177:00.60]But you convinced me that I shit my pants here right now.
[177:06.46]Do I freak out, run to the bathroom and check?
[177:21.89]Okay, so when I check and there's nothing there, do I still think I did it?
[177:31.18]Yes.
[177:40.31]So, how many of you guys have had the weird panic-inducing moment where...
[177:45.71]You're out somewhere.
[177:46.99]And this is why I don't like to fart anywhere.
[177:49.07]I don't fart.
[177:49.55]I'm not a farter.
[177:50.58]This is a dead serious conversation.
[177:52.88]I don't fart.
[177:53.88]I try to wait.
[177:54.94]And I try to do it in the bathroom or something.
[177:56.98]Because I always have this weird panic.
[177:59.04]Where if I'm out somewhere.
[178:00.44]And I'm doing something.
[178:02.02]And if I fart.
[178:03.61]And I shit my pants.
[178:06.03]This is panic always in the back of my mind.
[178:10.45]Where like I cannot fart because I may shit my pants.
[178:34.78]And even if I know I don't, I still think I did.
[178:42.23]And I will have this, I'll be going, man, I really probably should check to see if I shit my pants.
[178:45.78]I know I didn't, but what if I did?
[178:55.48]Uh, I think I softlocked myself, by the way.
[178:57.25]I don't have enough health to do this.
[179:18.82]Enchanted.
[179:19.26]Enter by Celoton.
[179:28.75]You can heal sanity if you wave with the torch.
[179:45.20]I don't like these.
[179:45.78]I want the big one.
[179:48.80]I'm just gonna win.
[179:49.78]I'm gonna beat it right now.
[179:50.90]I'm gonna win right now.
[179:51.60]I'm sitting up.
[180:15.93]Sanity ain't gonna go down.
[180:20.97]Back it up.
[180:21.61]I'm way too close.
[180:22.71]There's no reason to be this close.
[180:44.08]Pretend to be cool.
[180:56.02]Kill him!
[181:08.67]No, no, no, no, no!
[181:09.53]That's the guy!
[181:10.05]That's the guy!
[181:10.43]That's the guy!
[181:10.79]Kill him!
[181:11.15]Kill him!
[181:11.41]Kill him!
[181:11.77]Swing!
[181:11.95]Swing!
[181:12.09]Swing!
[181:19.27]Okay, big guy coming.
[181:22.45]Where's the big guy?
[181:42.30]Oh fuck, big guy coming.
[181:44.05]Big guy coming, big guy coming, big guy coming.
[181:46.13]Get full sanity.
[181:46.85]Big guy right in the way.
[181:48.47]Big guy on the way.
[181:51.37]Alright, can I save the game right here?
[181:52.67]Fuck.
[181:58.23]Okay, here we go.
[182:00.63]HeroCast 7.7.
[182:41.93]know where I can go dude it's so stupid what I can't even swing at him why would you why would they make you fight one of these huge hulk monsters in a room that's as big as a bathroom in an airplane like what why are we doing this here
[183:15.01]I'm trying to cut his arm, and it's like... And I got it once, and oh my god.
[183:49.21]Stop!
[183:51.47]No, I've ruined it already.
[183:53.43]I need help.
[183:58.80]I'm softlocked.
[183:59.80]I can't even beat the game.
[184:00.58]The game's over.
[184:01.16]I have a tiny little bit of health.
[184:05.50]I can't even do it.
[184:11.05]Why can't I execute the people on the ground?
[184:15.53]Oh, I'm so dead again.
[184:32.02]I'm about to fucking rip- I was gonna say I'm about to rip the disk out, but that's not even possible anymore.
[184:38.47]Should I just do it?
[184:39.35]Even though it's not even- I'm not gonna do anything?
[184:41.27]I'm so dead.
[185:05.60]One of these guys is going to turn into the bird and then the bird is going to slash me and my sanity is going to go to zero.
[185:13.98]Uh, what?
[185:22.23]There he is.
[185:22.65]There's the fucking goddamn bird.
[185:24.17]Sanity zero.
[185:31.11]There's no other safe point.
[185:32.03]I can't.
[185:32.35]There's no other safe point in the whole game.
[185:47.05]Use the torch.
[185:47.57]It kills in one hit.
[185:48.25]You are gaslighting yourself by using the big knife.
[186:00.98]Don't tell me that.
[186:02.24]Don't tell me that.
[186:02.84]If it's real, then I get very upset.
[186:05.64]Just only use the torch and the sanity spell.
[186:07.49]Okay, that's what I'm doing.
[186:10.97]Use the chakrams.
[186:12.99]What do the chakrams do?
[186:19.99]Throwing weapon.
[186:20.59]Okay.
[186:29.15]Throwing weapon at the big guy.
[186:39.16]How did I use one?
[186:39.80]Why are there 19?
[186:49.54]Okay, I'm ready.
[187:05.66]Don't even look at him.
[187:06.46]Why am I letting him look at me?
[187:11.81]This had to be the room that everybody said start pretending.
[187:16.80]Look what happens.
[187:17.48]You guys just get what you want.
[187:19.75]That's not even what I'm doing.
[187:27.39]See, now in all of your minds, I did start pretending to make sure that I could make a funny stream and he's stuck in the roof!
[187:34.10]He's stuck in the airplane bathroom!
[187:57.02]Best pretending stream of 2020.
[187:59.99]Alright, the bird's coming.
[188:13.34]Big knife aim up.
[188:14.44]Yeah, I was trying that.
[188:22.17]Look at that.
[188:22.49]Look at the sanity.
[188:28.03]It's too fast.
[188:29.11]Stop being so... I hate this.
[188:35.56]I'm gonna fucking scream.
[188:57.22]I'm about to fucking yell as loud as I can.
[189:13.76]Swap to other weapon for the bird.
[189:37.88]This is the one I can feel it.
[189:43.52]Just use emulator saves.
[189:46.45]Wait, what do you mean?
[189:47.59]Hold on.
[189:50.37]Wait, don't tell me I can do that because then it'll ruin the rest of the whole stream.
[189:56.67]I'm going to abuse the hell out of that.
[189:57.93]I'm just going to be completely abused.
[190:02.14]I'm not there yet.
[190:04.12]I know it exists.
[190:04.86]Good to know.
[190:05.42]I'm not there yet.
[190:07.06]We'll see.
[190:07.54]Maybe.
[190:08.96]Maybe.
[190:10.64]Not yet.
[190:15.24]Let me try to do it on my own.
[190:16.20]Okay.
[190:37.34]Alright, come on.
[190:40.08]Try to fight the bone thief in the hallway.
[190:45.50]I just gotta get one or two clean hits on him.
[190:49.59]And I'm just gonna throw the... It's not a children's game.
[191:04.12]This is rated M for Mature.
[191:09.72]This is for mature adults only.
[191:11.98]Yeah, it is rated M. M for mayonnaise.
[191:31.59]Okay, let's go.
[191:40.36]Gotta hit them one, two, three.
[191:42.98]Grab the two-handed sword and hit them once.
[191:48.33]In fact, I'm going to do it up here.
[191:53.81]Okay, okay, do it!
[191:54.89]Spell, spell, spell, spell, spell, spell.
[191:57.04]Good.
[191:58.70]Good.
[192:00.02]Not bad.
[192:01.88]Good start, good start, good start, good start, good start.
[192:03.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[192:23.44]Okay, now put on the... How do I use these?
[192:40.89]Where is he?
[192:43.45]My controls are backwards again.
[192:44.79]Okay.
[192:57.83]He makes the analog backwards.
[193:00.95]My analog is upside down.
[193:02.85]No!
[193:28.66]This is unbearable.
[193:30.14]Fuck!
[193:32.79]This is not even... Like, I don't remember this being like this.
[193:39.77]No, I can't use safe state.
[193:41.21]I'll never do it.
[193:41.87]I gotta do it on my own.
[193:50.48]Why do I have to fight the huge guy?
[193:53.38]By the way, aiming those little frisbees is... It doesn't make any sense.
[194:06.14]Once you get restore life, you'll never have to do this again.
[194:10.85]Yeah, I'd love to get it.
[194:11.93]No, we're going back to original strategy.
[194:18.81]Enchant the tiny swords blue?
[194:30.52]You are sent to Zelda.
[194:35.27]How do I make a save state?
[194:36.97]What's the button?
[194:37.59]Don't say Alt-F4.
[194:38.35]If you say Alt-F4, you're getting timed out for 10 minutes.
[194:54.09]What is it?
[194:54.51]Shift what?
[194:59.21]Hello, Jeremy.
[194:59.67]I'm your biggest fan.
[195:00.51]Alright.
[195:04.50]Wait, what are you showing me?
[195:09.35]Someone needs to put an imgur link.
[195:11.59]Load state, save state.
[195:12.83]To capture it, go to save slot 1.
[195:16.97]Shift F1.
[195:17.73]Okay, here we go.
[195:20.77]Ready?
[195:21.23]Let's see if it works.
[195:23.80]Got it.
[195:24.00]Okay.
[195:26.66]We're good.
[195:27.22]We're good.
[195:27.56]We're good.
[195:27.86]We're good.
[195:28.12]We're good.
[195:28.40]Thank you.
[195:28.70]You are sent to Zelda.
[195:34.58]Shift F1 whenever I'm feeling scared.
[195:37.90]Cheating?
[195:38.16]I don't care.
[195:39.74]I gave up on that a long time ago.
[195:40.86]I'm only going to use it seldomly, I promise.
[195:53.27]Here comes Santa.
[195:58.81]Here comes Santa.
[196:01.57]Now it's over.
[196:03.38]Everything's ruined because now I'm going to do that forever.
[196:06.14]I'm not going to use it all the time.
[196:07.16]I'm only going to get out of this fucking room.
[196:08.64]I promise.
[196:09.12]Okay.
[196:42.69]I'm gonna abuse it.
[196:55.46]Get away from me.
[196:56.80]Stop running so fast.
[196:57.86]Okay, here we go.
[197:28.60]Your experience is ruined.
[197:29.68]No, it's not.
[197:30.18]It's only for this room.
[197:31.00]I promise.
[198:00.59]Good.
[198:01.33]Okay.
[198:01.81]Yay.
[198:03.43]Yay.
[198:15.40]Blue.
[198:15.74]Pog, I guess.
[198:21.28]It is not a pog.
[198:22.96]I'm embarrassed, but I don't care.
[198:27.30]I wouldn't be able to do that.
[198:28.26]No way.
[198:33.52]Alright, so did I get anything from this?
[198:36.84]Besides the blue thing lighting up?
[198:42.76]Watch it.
[198:44.90]Shaped like a delicate dome, a pale blue statuette floats.
[198:48.02]Should I claim this?
[198:49.12]Yeah.
[198:54.76]Kareem.
[198:56.75]We will be together forever.
[198:59.23]Chandra?
[199:05.26]She's dead?
[199:14.47]What are you teaching America's youth?
[199:22.58]Cheating?
[199:22.96]I can't believe I let my children watch your stream.
[199:25.04]Spread it then for maturity.
[199:27.32]That's what you press when you first come to the stream.
[199:32.19]as the last blades were drawn across my body and my blood pooled upon the floor.
[199:38.38]She cursed that I would only be with another in death.
[199:42.18]So much for thinking only of me.
[199:45.12]I should never have left.
[199:46.34]I have seen my folly and have already paid dearly.
[199:49.97]What farce again?
[199:50.67]No.
[199:50.89]I see so much more now.
[199:52.61]No, I... We're getting over that.
[199:54.19]I'm not talking about, like... I'm not talking about that ever again.
[199:58.47]And it is not for us to possess.
[200:01.79]If we are to be together again, you must make a sacrifice.
[200:07.25]Only when that is complete will we be together.
[200:10.57]Sacrifice?
[200:13.15]Why should I do anything for you?
[200:16.95]You lied to me.
[200:18.73]Betrayed me.
[200:19.55]And you really don't look so good anymore.
[200:23.76]You must forget the past.
[200:26.98]Despite who you are now, you will also become something more.
[200:32.29]Just as I am.
[200:34.65]But the sacrifice must be made.
[200:37.69]We must remain here and guard the artifact.
[200:41.49]Dark things will come to claim it, and you must be strong to keep it from them.
[200:46.63]Without your sacrifice, the world will fall into eternal darkness.
[200:54.71]The things I do for love.
[200:59.81]She kisses me to death?
[201:09.16]It's going up his nostrils.
[201:11.24]He's like... He's... What was that?
[201:20.55]What was that, like, 1995 screensaver?
[201:33.98]Okay, so now... What did I... What did he do?
[201:38.94]I have the key to the dresser, which I haven't done anything about.
[201:44.20]What did I get?
[201:45.24]Did I get a new spell?
[201:59.11]Sword door.
[202:01.23]Oh yeah, that's right.
[202:02.81]The sword door.
[202:08.76]That's not the sword door.
[202:10.80]Save.
[202:11.31]I am.
[202:13.23]Oh, that's pretend saving.
[202:14.37]You're talking about real hard saving.
[202:16.05]Yep.
[202:25.20]So I can enchant this green and we'll do the green door.
[202:36.02]Okay.
[202:40.21]Uh... Somebody... Is this a phone call?
[202:57.61]Why is this... Why is this so odd?
[203:07.44]That's actually pretty creepy.
[203:09.06]That's creepy.
[203:09.62]I will say it's creepy.
[203:12.00]Alright, we got a quick spell.
[203:13.40]Alright, enchant item.
[203:14.08]This one.
[203:16.76]After five?
[203:26.46]It's just a pantry.
[203:33.00]Sealed it away for centuries.
[203:34.36]I didn't want anyone to touch my marshmallow fluff.
[203:38.78]You can only get that shit in the northeast.
[203:41.42]Can't get it anywhere else.
[203:44.48]Which is bullshit, by the way.
[203:49.34]Spice jar.
[203:53.24]Well, that's a huge rat.
[203:53.96]Alright, what's in the spice jar?
[204:01.25]Firmly sealed glass spice jar.
[204:03.39]The aroma of Arabian spices in there.
[204:05.59]Open it up.
[204:12.24]My liege.
[204:35.23]The future is yours.
[204:37.59]The light in the age of darkness has been extinguished.
[204:42.09]The pillar of flesh has been constructed.
[204:45.88]The master of chaos, the keeper of the ancients, is long dead.
[204:52.04]The planets will be in alignment soon.
[204:54.68]All is prepared for your arrival.
[204:57.60]I will begin the final incantation that will bring you into our world within days.
[205:04.97]The next millennium will truly usher in a new age.
[205:09.79]Your guardians, now prepare the gate.
[205:13.11]Okay, so I got it.
[205:19.04]What's this one?
[205:19.58]This is chapter five?
[205:21.34]What year is this?
[205:22.42]I will not argue that I was shocked by the sudden mention of one of my ancestors.
[205:27.51]Oh, this is 1760.
[205:28.75]The distinguished Dr. Maximilian Roivas.
[205:32.81]It chilled me to my bones.
[205:35.35]It all just takes place in the same house.
[205:38.77]How had my ancestor stumbled upon it?
[205:43.25]I feverishly began to read more, eager to learn his story.
[205:49.67]It seems that Maximilian had inherited his father's mansion, just as I had.
[205:55.91]Alone since the death of his wife, and since his children had their own adult lives.
[206:02.18]He explored the house to discover his family roots.
[206:05.78]I saw that.
[206:06.36]Yeah, it's okay.
[206:14.89]It has been two weeks since the death of my father, and it has finally come to me to look over the mansion.
[206:22.25]Now, I am truly alone and forced to start a new life here in Rhode Island.
[206:30.81]Those powdered wigs are so cool.
[206:33.49]I wish it was still cool to wear those.
[206:34.83]Why do these go out of style?
[206:36.23]Because they're ugly.
[206:56.73]But at what point in history did people just take these off and go, nah, nah, fuck that.
[207:00.44]I don't want to wear that.
[207:01.50]It looks terrible.
[207:03.58]What was the first generation that's like, nah, I don't want to put on that.
[207:05.78]It looks horrible.
[207:09.46]Something had to have happened.
[207:10.32]This had to have been something weird.
[207:11.94]Okay, the flintlock pistol.
[207:22.51]Oh, you get a gun.
[207:25.39]I have a gun.
[207:26.95]Now I got a gun.
[207:41.82]Walking around my own house with my gun.
[207:46.80]Okay, that's not a monster, is it?
[207:52.48]No, this is... Okay, this is a... It's a servant.
[207:55.12]Okay.
[207:56.56]Jesus.
[207:59.70]Why do I look so angry?
[208:00.70]Okay, was something in the room?
[208:20.46]Why did I do that?
[208:21.18]I didn't.
[208:22.34]You ever seen the Adam Sandler movie where he rewinds time?
[208:24.30]You can do whatever you want.
[208:25.18]You can do anything.
[208:26.96]The guy's fine.
[208:27.54]He's right there.
[208:28.02]He's alive.
[208:30.33]Interior outhouse.
[208:37.09]Ooh, I get more ammo.
[208:37.87]Two more?
[208:41.05]What about this candle thing?
[208:55.27]The door to the servant's quarters is securely locked.
[208:57.13]I can't help but feel uneasy.
[208:59.05]An ominous presence lurks behind that door.
[209:01.17]Alright.
[209:06.92]Okay.
[209:07.64]Stained glass window, resplendent with bright colors and exquisite workmanship.
[209:12.18]There's something odd about it.
[209:13.18]Perhaps the curious detail.
[209:15.90]Curious.
[209:16.26]Stop calling everything a stick bug.
[209:32.41]More ammo, okay.
[209:38.25]Get stick bugged.
[209:43.05]Letter.
[209:44.95]What does the letter say?
[209:46.01]A letter written with some precision in longhand.
[209:54.14]Dear friend, the antiquity of which you ask is indeed the tomb of eternal darkness.
[210:01.01]Or a copy of it, at least.
[210:02.89]Its secrets are still hidden from me, for I have been unable to read it, as have most scholars who have tried.
[210:08.63]It will remain within the sanctity of the mansion.
[210:11.35]For the wrong hands, it would be a powerful weapon.
[210:13.49]Anything else?
[210:16.65]Mr. Roivas.
[210:20.95]Medical journal.
[210:22.91]Used to take notes on medical and pathological analysis.
[210:25.47]Okay, I got 15 bullets.
[210:34.36]Got clothes on today?
[210:35.06]No.
[210:37.86]The answer to that question is always no.
[210:42.49]I swear to god I keep thinking they're bad guys.
[210:44.09]What the fuck is that?
[211:00.55]Toilet.
[211:02.67]Wait.
[211:05.10]Mirror's grim reflection returns Max's questioning gaze.
[211:08.06]More ammo.
[211:12.92]Alright, I got a lot of ammo.
[211:22.10]Shoot window.
[211:22.86]You're exhausting.
[211:23.84]Shoot window.
[211:24.87]Relax.
[211:26.77]Stop.
[211:30.89]I haven't even gone in all the rooms yet.
[211:32.67]I'm just looking around.
[211:52.80]I've pointed the gun at every single person here.
[212:02.12]Jingle keys into the mic or riot.
[212:03.91]Is that a baseball bat?
[212:06.61]Pump handle, cool.
[212:14.79]While going about her duties, the servant casually remarks about a strange quality hanging in the air.
[212:19.40]Something weird going on.
[212:24.22]Jingle keys, jingle.
[212:25.66]Look, how about this?
[212:26.28]I have two glass bottles.
[212:27.78]How about I just go like this?
[212:28.60]Is that better?
[212:47.97]Yes, people are happy.
[212:57.22]Who are you?
[212:57.48]What are you doing here?
[213:01.08]Who are you?
[213:01.48]What's this?
[213:01.76]Uh, the biggest foe is Blue.
[213:04.86]Blue hates- Blue hates- Green hates Blue, Blue hates Red.
[213:06.82]Right?
[213:29.44]Isaac is shocked.
[213:30.19]Is it red?
[213:36.75]Wait, I thought it was blue.
[213:43.57]Enter secret passage.
[213:44.43]Not yet.
[213:46.79]Uh... Sword.
[213:55.78]Curled scroll of aged parchment.
[213:59.04]Reveal Invisible spell.
[214:03.19]And a Cutlass.
[214:06.39]I'll take it.
[214:10.82]Jermich's Fart.
[214:11.60]No.
[214:12.74]No.
[214:13.56]But I did used to do that, though.
[214:17.53]I know we've talked about this.
[214:19.41]I know we have, but just to give you a little bit, people that might not know.
[214:23.11]There was a time during my YouTube career.
[214:25.11]He said career, he said office.
[214:27.61]Where I was putting just fart noises in videos.
[214:31.91]And I did it like three or four times over a course of a couple of weeks.
[214:35.39]And after like the third or fourth time, nobody even noticed they were there.
[214:40.44]And I just was like, this is not funny anymore.
[214:42.10]Nobody cares.
[214:44.09]Nobody thought that was funny.
[214:45.35]Nobody even mentioned it.
[214:46.63]It was just so, I guess, so normal that nobody cared to even say what was that at four minutes and 25 seconds.
[214:54.93]This went on for at least a week or two.
[214:57.25]And even years later, I did it still.
[215:00.45]And nobody ever said anything.
[215:04.47]I have no idea what videos they were.
[215:06.63]I have absolutely no clue.
[215:13.41]He never stopped farting.
[215:14.45]Sick.
[215:18.71]I- there was one specifically where I was talking to somebody.
[215:21.49]I think I was talking to Star.
[215:24.29]And I was like, blah blah blah blah blah, I said a sentence, and then there was a fart noise.
[215:29.27]This.
[215:30.18]You found it?
[215:31.98]Wait, hold on, did you actually find it?
[215:41.14]Found- did you found one?
[215:47.13]But I did it at least a few times.
[215:48.94]Right, so... I, uh...
[216:15.70]And I never talked about it, I don't think either.
[216:17.14]This was never brought up ever again.
[216:21.14]And then I did it a couple more times and it wasn't funny.
[216:24.00]It wasn't even making me laugh and I still put it in the videos.
[216:33.39]Here's another one.
[216:36.91]How would you even know where these were?
[216:38.71]There's no way you found them all already.

[217:43.10]Everybody thought I was making it up.
[217:46.82]There's not another one here.
[218:09.67]Definitely not a fourth one though, right?
[218:18.98]I farted in this one.
[218:20.82]There's one in this TF2 Halloween video from 2013.
[218:38.15]Oh, why would I put this?
[218:39.17]Okay, you know what?
[218:41.47]This loadout video from February 9th, 2014.
[218:45.53]In the comment section.
[218:46.56]Does anybody say anything about it?
[218:47.88]I don't see anything.
[218:52.84]People just stopped giving.
[218:53.82]Some people stopped caring.
[218:54.72]Do you see how I had to stop doing this because it wasn't funny?
[219:07.42]This is a year apart, by the way.
[219:09.98]Okay, this is TF2 I Bet You 100 Bucks, November 3rd, 2013.
[219:14.81]February 9th, 2014 was the loadout video.
[219:19.15]This is a full fucking year apart.
[219:22.57]We're in the fucking call and I told you I was going to a Halloween party.
[219:24.79]What'd you tell me?
[219:25.49]Hold on, is this a stenographer?
[219:33.06]Jesus Christ.
[219:35.51]Yeah, probably at least... What's the GTA video?
[219:38.89]October 16th, 2013.
[219:48.68]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[219:49.78]I want to see if this one's real.
[219:51.20]I know I did it at least five or six times.
[219:54.71]This is a Family Guy Peter Farting compilation.
[219:56.83]Alright, I'm going to move on.
[220:01.73]Another GTA video?
[220:09.27]No, I'm getting linked, like, just random, like, Peter Griffin fart sound videos.
[220:19.91]Alright, you get the idea, though.
[220:31.46]Examine.
[220:31.86]Appears to be a wax rubbing of some kind.
[220:34.64]Do I have dual pistols?
[220:43.46]Windlock pistol.
[220:44.36]Ooh, dual pistols.
[220:47.26]What?
[220:48.10]No way.
[220:53.54]Are we going to go kill that guy out there?
[220:59.07]Okay, well, I didn't... I didn't want to shoot him.
[221:08.69]Reload?
[221:17.63]Reload the gun!
[221:29.07]We found another one.
[221:29.81]The video we were looking for was the August 2015 GTA video.
[221:34.27]Hold on, wait.
[221:34.87]I don't know how the fuck you guys find this shit.
[221:41.59]It's another one in Cry of Fear.
[221:49.78]Hold on.
[221:50.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[221:51.96]Cry of fear?
[221:55.18]No, this is The Simpsons song.
[222:00.92]No, you guys are not even la- There's a baby crying!
[222:04.62]This is a real fart from you.
[222:15.85]Watch it again, real quick.
[222:19.86]What?
[222:22.90]Watch it again real quick.
[222:24.86]Also, by the way, I'm having an insane epiphany right now.
[222:29.30]And this is tearing down the entire fabric of my fucking mind.
[222:34.28]I was doing that on streams too.
[222:37.79]Recently.
[222:38.97]I had a fart machine.
[222:41.39]And I would play it sometimes.
[222:43.91]Like over the last 6 to 12 months.
[222:46.35]And I never said anything about it.
[222:48.17]I did it on these streams too.
[222:53.74]Yeah, I have been doing that.
[222:57.90]No, you haven't?
[222:58.40]Yes, I have.
[223:04.24]Yes, I have.
[223:04.84]I've been doing it a lot.
[223:05.82]Does somebody have a clip of me doing it on stream?
[223:09.88]I'm not gaslighting you guys.
[223:10.78]This is real.
[223:11.26]This is really happening.
[223:12.86]I know for a fact that one of them happened at least on the stream that me and Joel did.
[223:16.45]At least two or three times.
[223:18.35]We did that bomb defusal game.
[223:20.75]I did it like three times on that stream.
[223:22.29]And didn't talk about it at all.
[223:24.75]And then did it like I swear to god I did it like two or three weeks later and then a month later.
[223:34.18]It's real.
[223:34.62]It's real.
[223:35.40]Stop linking me to the fucking Family Guy thing.
[223:39.40]You're fart lighting us.
[223:40.36]I'm not... Somebody will get it.
[223:42.70]I swear to God.
[223:43.96]Somebody will actually get the real one.
[223:46.68]Holy shit.
[223:47.90]Was it the second bomb defuser?
[223:49.18]I did it like 10 times.
[223:50.22]134.15.
[223:51.12]Alright, I'm gonna stop.
[223:58.04]Because no one is actually linking me anything.
[224:03.14]You guys are just all linking your favorite fart videos.
[224:08.44]Somebody's got one?
[224:12.53]You've laughed at every fart.
[224:14.03]I have not laughed at every single fart.
[224:16.48]Absolutely not.
[224:17.94]No way.
[224:22.50]You're my queen.
[224:23.36]I have not laughed at every single one.
[224:26.06]You bring me documented proof.
[224:29.38]I did not.
[224:31.12]No, I did not.
[224:32.38]Bullshit.
[224:33.14]I don't believe it.
[224:33.98]What?
[224:40.41]Here's where... This doesn't do anything.
[224:42.73]You've laughed at every fart.
[224:44.09]Blue wire.
[224:44.57]I have not laughed at every... There's no red wires.
[224:48.41]There's one red... I fucking said that!
[224:50.06]Okay.
[224:50.60]There's only... There's only one red wire.
[224:52.64]There's one red wire!
[224:54.44]Okay, alright.
[224:55.86]Is the last wire yellow?
[224:57.72]No, it's blue.
[224:59.14]Okay.
[225:00.30]Is there one blue wire?
[225:01.64]There's...
[225:03.07]Jerma, I swear, I'm gonna fucking come over to Boston and I'm gonna fucking- Alright, is there one- I don't even live there anymore, man!
[225:08.09]Well, I'm fucking- Where's the fart?
[225:10.97]Is there one- Yes or no, is there one blue wire?
[225:13.96]There's- I- There's no fart here, you guys are fucking this all up!
[225:23.54]Radeem, fart point, fart Radeem.
[225:25.50]Oh my god, you guys.
[225:28.92]Fart Radeem.
[225:29.88]FINE!
[225:33.62]That's one.
[225:34.06]Alright, I have to move on from this shit.
[225:37.52]I can't sit here all day.
[225:45.78]That was a real one.
[225:46.48]No, it wasn't real.
[225:47.12]Hold on, here's another one.
[225:49.61]We're looking at red.
[225:54.49]Blue.
[225:56.27]We have owls.
[225:57.07]We have owls.
[225:57.57]We have owls.
[226:00.62]We have ours.
[226:01.48]We have ours.
[226:02.60]Red.
[226:04.96]We're looking at red.
[226:08.12]Blue.
[226:09.94]We have ours.
[226:10.81]We have ours.
[226:11.27]We have ours.
[226:12.25]I did it so many times.
[226:15.27]I swear to God, people got pissed one time.
[226:19.75]People got pissed one time.
[226:22.59]I forget what the exact context was, but I did it and people got fucking mad.
[226:26.52]They were like, stop, dude.
[226:27.78]That's not funny.
[226:31.63]Did he skyline stream?
[226:32.77]There's at least a couple.
[226:33.61]Somebody got pissed.
[226:34.89]And it wasn't funny at all.
[226:44.10]He's gaslighting.
[226:44.98]No, I have a distinct memory.
[226:46.46]I just don't know what the fucking game it was.
[226:48.14]Everyone doesn't know the Omega symbol.
[226:52.42]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[226:53.96]I'm done.
[226:54.40]I'm done.
[226:54.92]I'm done.
[226:56.74]I'm done.
[226:57.68]Skylines clip.
[226:58.82]Stop!
[226:59.48]I'm not clicking.
[227:00.94]Mods!
[227:02.91]When an autopsy has been performed, Max can view the new entry by turning to the journal section of the tomb and selecting autopsy at the bottom of the page.
[227:11.02]Okay.
[227:15.71]Autopsy.
[227:18.03]The creature wears the skin of people to protect itself.
[227:21.41]Gross.
[227:30.44]But yeah, it was a couple times when I did it on stream and people did not notice.
[227:35.44]And I was sitting there going, fuck, nobody noticed I did that.
[227:41.33]Nobody said anything.
[227:46.85]Oh god, he's here.
[227:47.97]Wait.
[227:58.17]He's just kicking this guy's ass.
[227:59.57]He's not a bad guy?
[228:00.43]They were all possessed.
[228:18.79]Some are possessed.
[228:20.27]Oh shit!
[228:20.89]I don't even know if I hit him.
[228:29.74]Move out of the way!
[228:43.73]You did the same thing in God Hand.
[228:45.31]Hold on, I haven't save stated in a long time.
[228:46.91]I'm gonna die.
[228:57.16]I can't shoot his arms off.
[228:58.20]Okay, just kill me.
[229:01.63]When was the last save state?
[229:05.83]I miss God Hand.
[229:12.61]It's far back.
[229:13.77]I don't even know how far back it is.
[229:15.10]We're good.
[229:20.22]I just had to load that save real quick.
[229:38.46]Okay, take out the cutlass.
[229:44.16]Stop, please.
[229:57.53]Alright, there we can see the autopsy.
[229:59.01]Cool, cool, cool.
[229:59.99]Let's just get a little bit of a save state.
[230:08.99]Somebody's gonna find them.
[230:10.67]Because I said it.
[230:11.39]And now people are gonna look.
[230:13.04]And you'll find them.
[230:16.28]And we can be embarrassed for me when we hear them eventually.
[230:20.06]I want to load the gun.
[230:26.27]I'll open the door.
[230:37.76]Black and White 2 VOD had one.
[230:39.95]I'm not going to click them unless they're verified mod links.
[231:08.78]Cut it off!
[231:10.10]Cut his arm off!
[231:22.99]He's dead.
[231:23.31]Alright.
[231:23.79]What a pain in the ass.
[231:25.51]He's not dead.
[231:29.30]Just shoot him in the head.
[231:33.34]That's not his head.
[231:38.53]Thank you, God.
[231:42.17]Mods, we got one.
[231:42.97]Mods, we got one.

[232:23.27]Why is it so low?
[232:24.29]The game is too high.
[232:29.23]I'll turn the game down.

[233:52.39]I'm done.

[233:59.89]Okay, cool.
[234:01.27]Let's go ahead and go back to what we were doing here.
[234:09.82]Alright, so let's put that on the little bar here.
[234:17.52]Spell list.
[234:19.56]Reveal invisible.
[234:22.80]We do blue or green?

[235:14.75]Wow, I would not be very good.
[235:18.00]Very bad.
[235:19.20]Not be very good.
[235:19.89]Alright.
[235:36.21]I have some bad news for you.
[235:37.11]Remember when you said that Otto had a savory dog smell as he slept?
[235:40.90]That's actually little dog farts.
[235:42.18]You were sniffing his sleepy dog farts, and you said it was savory, and that's not even real.
[235:47.14]That's not, that's not accurate.
[235:49.09]That's fake.
[235:51.57]That's not actually what was going on, but sure, okay.
[236:13.33]Nothing.
[236:15.73]Nothing.
[236:16.17]Reload the guns.
[236:24.39]Why do you huff your dog while he's sleeping?
[236:25.87]What the fuck?
[236:26.27]This is... Look.
[236:28.35]Don't listen to everybody in here.
[236:29.75]Why are you listening to these people?
[236:38.44]He's bleeding.
[236:57.13]Get him!
[236:57.91]Get him!
[237:12.30]If you don't know what the sleepy dog smell is, I'm sorry.
[237:15.14]You don't have the part of your DNA that allows you to smell it.
[237:20.62]Alright, ones in the chat.
[237:22.38]Do you know what the sleepy dog smell is?
[237:24.86]Ones or not.
[237:25.58]It's just like having an eternal monolog.
[237:30.97]Thank you.
[237:32.29]Thank you so much, all of you.
[237:43.43]It's not dog farts.
[237:44.97]It's like a scientific thing that happens with a dog when it sleeps.
[237:48.89]It's something with their paws and their... I don't know.
[237:50.77]Ooh, what's this?
[237:58.65]An envelope?
[238:00.69]Let's get it.
[238:01.13]That was supposed to scare me, but I was looking at you guys talking to me about how my dog doesn't smell.
[238:07.56]That was supposed to scare me.
[238:21.18]Uh, melted wax and odd rune is pressed into the wax.
[238:27.92]Letter addressed to one of Max's father's aides.
[238:32.21]And I got the basement key.
[238:35.05]That's totally tubular.
[238:38.73]A, uh, dear friend, as I expected, the beasts are drawing closer to our discovery.
[238:44.25]They want the book for themselves, it seems, and do not want us to have it in our possession.
[238:48.06]I have taken steps to ensure that their ilk will not touch the key in this envelope.
[238:53.04]Should you fall prey to their claws, the envelope containing the basement key has been sealed with a corrosive magic.
[239:00.72]If one not aligned to us tries to handle it, it will be released, inflicting pain, suffering, and a grievous blow to their sanity.
[239:06.48]Okay?
[239:08.96]It's blue.
[239:09.88]So just be blue.
[239:21.81]Load those guns up.
[239:26.07]Load those guns up.
[239:29.74]So people say, asking tomorrow, what time... I want to just make it clear again.
[239:34.73]DLC movie night is tomorrow, starting somewhere around between 11 and 12 Pacific.
[239:42.49]Around like 11 to 12 p.m.
[239:46.89]11 a.m.
[239:47.18]to 12 p.m.
[239:51.04]I'm assuming we're going to be sitting there for a good solid five to six hours.
[239:54.72]Someone's coming down the hall.
[239:55.86]Okay.
[240:05.06]Down to the basement.
[240:09.02]Wait, why are we in sepia town?
[240:19.47]Where'd he go?
[240:27.35]Wait, should I do the invisibility spell?
[240:38.20]He's abusing cheats.
[240:41.24]No, I'm using cheats, not abusing them.
[240:44.34]How many times do I have to shoot him in the head?
[240:52.05]It's not the same thing.
[240:53.03]You guys got three heads.
[241:04.39]Okay, should I keep shooting in the middle head?
[241:13.99]from a quick fart viewers are plummeting no that doesn't but I don't care good freeze frame look at that zoom in on that that's a great picture am I stuck like this okay no wait I finally got it thank god okay new spell list heal we want recover

[241:51.75]Alright.
[241:54.65]It's time to drop the Banhammer.
[242:15.44]Let's probably just put heals around the whole thing, huh?
[242:19.20]Cover, assign mana to... We'll go up here.
[242:26.58]This isn't doing anything.
[242:51.52]Wait, am I back to normal?
[242:57.39]He's an invisible horror stalking him.
[242:58.97]Have you no eyes?
[242:59.67]Can you not see it?
[243:00.51]Ooh, wait.
[243:01.09]Hold on.
[243:06.47]Let's find the invisible guy.
[243:08.58]He says there's an invisible guy stalking him.
[243:23.50]Guess not.
[243:26.84]Blind?
[243:27.16]I'm fighting green guys.
[243:34.76]Oh.
[243:34.96]Oh.
[243:42.00]Is there nobody here?
[243:51.57]What's this?
[243:54.72]Probably refers to some kind of spell.
[243:56.52]Why am I so slow?
[243:57.08]I need to unlock the basement.
[243:59.43]This is not the basement.
[244:22.61]Jump King waiting room.
[244:24.03]You're gonna be waiting for a very, very long time.
[244:31.17]Where's the basement?
[244:43.95]Saw waiting room?
[244:51.04]Is it all the way in the back?
[244:53.10]Hold on.
[245:05.31]When is Jeremy going to go insane?
[245:06.43]This is clickbait.
[245:08.71]Look, I don't know.
[245:09.95]I played this game 20 years ago.
[245:15.82]I don't remember.
[245:21.48]Why did I even shoot him?
[245:35.59]Classic Tuber.
[245:38.81]Oh.
[245:40.05]Yeah, well, I am a classic Tuber.
[245:41.63]Yeah, that's right.
[245:44.23]I was making YouTube videos back in like 2012, 2011.
[245:50.18]I think that makes me a classic YouTuber.
[245:53.26]Doesn't it?
[246:02.45]Are you punching me for real?
[246:16.08]You're really odd to walk into, though.
[246:18.40]You're one of the other servants.
[246:25.41]For a second, I thought I was not doing this right.
[246:34.07]You might know me from the servers.
[246:40.38]Wait, that person was normal.
[246:41.66]Why were they attacking me?
[246:47.23]Did she not walk up and punch me three times?
[246:52.47]What do you mean, no?
[246:59.13]She walked up and threw, like, three haymakers at me.
[247:01.37]Where did I go?
[247:05.75]Okay.
[247:17.96]I thought the game was actually broken.
[247:29.01]You got me.
[247:29.47]I don't know where to go.
[247:40.08]I'm trying to find the basement.
[247:52.28]Who's that?
[247:52.72]That was the somebody in the house dropped something in the shower sound.
[248:02.35]For some reason, it always sounds like they fell and smashed into everything and like broke three of their bones.
[248:06.82]Am I blind?
[248:21.22]Letter 5, letter 4, letter 2.
[248:24.31]Your friend.
[248:24.69]Whatever.
[248:28.09]I need to go to the basement.
[248:28.97]I don't know what to do.
[248:41.57]Well, you don't go up to go to the basement.
[248:44.77]Do invisible?
[248:45.23]Do invisible?
[248:47.52]Oh, there's an invisible door.
[248:48.74]Why do I hear a loud smashing?
[248:52.51]Oh, is somebody in this room?
[248:53.59]Hey, who's in here?
[248:57.59]Is he upstairs?
[249:04.93]There's nothing even in there.
[249:05.81]There's nobody here.
[249:06.55]Okay, that was weird.
[249:11.08]Okay, so I need to do, um, invisibility?
[249:17.25]Use the red reveal invisible spell.
[249:21.00]Oh, okay.
[249:34.73]Oh, I get it.
[249:35.83]Because it's the... Red hates green, green hates blue, blue hates green, and... Purple hates all of us or something, right?
[249:59.44]Rock, paper, scissors?
[250:00.20]Yeah.
[250:07.05]Get these ready.
[250:18.85]The guns.
[250:20.55]Oh, they're gonna turn into birds.
[250:26.37]Weird bird things.
[250:37.43]Not fight on the stairs.
[250:38.75]Can you please just back up a little so I can... What am I doing?
[250:54.26]I'll get stick fucked, you fucking loser.
[251:04.59]Now what's down here?
[251:09.03]New spell?
[251:10.30]Rewind time.
[251:11.14]Damage field.
[251:29.55]Ooh.
[251:29.71]I need the runes.
[251:30.51]Ammo?
[251:30.61]What's this?
[252:01.00]Pump some water.
[252:01.66]A rusted pump stands by the well.
[252:03.60]Its handle appears to be missing.
[252:04.84]Oh, I have one of those.
[252:13.64]I already have rewind time.
[252:16.53]That's true.
[252:19.87]Yep.
[252:20.81]You're right.
[252:39.03]Let me actually get a YouTube thumbnail.
[252:48.60]Respray.
[252:49.58]That's what it would have been.
[252:52.70]My thumbnails sucked.
[252:53.82]They were always so bad.
[252:54.76]It was always just, hey, to have a guy standing up that's a character in the game and just use the rule of thirds and people will think it looks good.
[253:04.24]A guy pointing a gun, a guy pointing his fist, a guy punching.
[253:08.11]It was every single thumbnail.
[253:10.63]I just couldn't be bothered, you know?
[253:13.05]I just wanted to upload the fucking video.
[253:14.65]Like, I was done.
[253:15.15]Just upload it.
[253:15.63]Did I just shoot myself in the head?
[253:19.16]Do I have bullets?
[253:27.96]Wait.
[253:29.19]Why am I in a prison?
[253:31.67]Wait, hold on.
[253:34.86]I was... Okay, I was in jail?
[253:39.16]Oh, alright, well... Give me that.
[253:49.73]Give me that.
[253:53.97]You know the main gimmick of this game?
[253:56.59]I just punched you in the face.
[253:57.77]I'm sorry.
[254:01.45]I'm so sorry.
[254:02.15]I really am.
[254:03.00]That like just... That was probably loud.
[254:07.90]Damage field spell.
[254:09.82]So nobody can walk through it.
[254:10.90]Should I turn it on?
[254:11.94]Fabulous.
[254:26.96]Stop touching the fucking mic, dude.
[254:28.54]Seriously.
[254:29.04]I have this rune now, right?
[254:47.59]Ripple?
[254:51.78]Oh, you don't have to render it.
[254:52.76]That's... No, that helps.
[255:18.11]You know, that would get me if this wasn't to, you know, 2020.
[255:30.82]This only works if you are alive in 1998.
[255:33.48]Turn it back up.
[255:38.60]I don't know how.
[255:39.44]I can't.
[255:51.78]Or did they turn down the cutscene?
[255:53.16]Alright, hold on.
[255:53.78]Wait, wait, wait.
[255:55.25]I'm sorry.
[255:55.85]It doesn't matter.
[255:56.45]Wait, so I have to do my spell. ...
[256:21.00]Does that do?
[256:29.27]Okay, power level.
[256:38.60]Protect.
[256:40.72]Protect, protect, protect.
[256:46.99]What did I do?
[256:47.39]Okay, green?
[256:48.03]Should I do green?
[256:48.57]Let me do green, maybe.
[256:50.53]Okay, green.
[256:53.43]Red.
[256:53.99]Go.
[257:33.39]Work?
[257:35.05]Oh!
[257:35.31]Got him!
[257:39.55]He's invisible though.
[257:40.57]I gotta turn this invisibility off.
[257:58.42]Stop.
[257:58.78]I need more magical energy.
[258:01.74]Tear Parka.
[258:05.79]Tear Parka.
[258:07.21]Parka.
[258:07.81]Tear Parka.
[258:08.95]Yep.
[258:09.15]I had it right.
[258:10.31]Shock him.
[258:34.17]Shoot him?
[258:35.35]I guess I could try to shoot him, but I don't think it would hurt him.
[258:43.34]Didn't do anything.
[258:45.16]You lied.
[258:46.62]Enchant it with red.
[258:51.21]Ooh!
[258:51.91]Nice.
[258:55.57]Okay, yeah.
[258:55.99]You're right.
[258:56.25]You're right.
[258:56.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[259:09.70]Alright, now I have red enchanted guns.
[259:11.02]So tough anymore, are you?
[259:13.18]Come on, come back.
[259:45.41]Reddit enchanted guns.
[259:46.65]Why does everything have to be Reddit with you guys?
[259:49.35]I didn't want to shoot that guy.
[260:10.33]Why is he so defensive about Reddit?
[260:12.07]I'm not, but what am I going to eat today?
[260:15.85]Wait, it took you three months to figure this out?
[260:40.32]That's a very long time.
[260:48.22]Damn, the powdered wig really does...
[261:07.81]Thank you.
[261:08.09]You look really different.
[261:11.25]He just looks like every dude I've ever seen at Walmart.
[261:14.82]Before he was like in a pirate outfit and he had the hair and... Thinking me mad with delirium.
[261:22.02]Fools cast away their hopes of salvation by locking me in this damned asylum.
[261:31.64]If I'm like the audio director here, it's like... That was a perfect take.
[261:37.94]What a perfect take, though.
[261:41.68]I wouldn't even change anything.
[262:09.50]What did I do?
[262:10.02]What?
[262:10.32]I pressed a button.
[262:13.22]Oh, wait.
[262:14.08]Oh.
[262:18.69]Fake DLC.
[262:19.79]Okay, that was cool.
[262:28.49]I can go into that into the basement now, right?
[262:36.98]Wait, aren't I already in the basement?
[262:40.93]I can go in the hidden door.
[262:50.28]Skipping lore?
[262:53.14]Grandma, you should make- I'm not gonna be coming out for a long time, okay?
[262:59.94]If you wanna go to the bathroom, use the one downstairs.
[263:05.02]Just leave me the fuck alone.
[263:12.53]This is where the hidden door was before.
[263:13.95]Shit!
[263:45.66]There's a hidden door.
[263:46.52]I have, like, new spells.
[263:51.30]I have reveal invisible.
[263:52.30]Damage field.
[263:53.96]Where have I not been able to go?
[263:57.26]Upstairs?
[264:10.18]Wait, the glass.
[264:11.07]Can I break the glass?
[264:12.47]Ah!
[264:17.77]What the hell is this?
[264:20.45]Blowing medieval maiden luminous even with the faint light of the setting sun.
[264:25.32]There's something in the... There's something in there.
[264:36.52]What?
[264:41.79]That wasn't it?
[264:49.67]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[264:55.37]What is it?
[264:55.99]What is it, kids?
[265:02.84]Darkest scene.
[265:03.54]Perhaps the circuit's been broken.
[265:04.74]Fuck.
[265:09.56]Cell phone?
[265:23.75]Does it have a dresser key?
[265:28.75]Where's the dresser key?
[265:33.61]I mean, where's the dresser that the key goes in?
[265:37.26]Isn't that a kind of... What do they mean by dresser?
[265:48.20]I need a funny voice so I can sleep.
[266:06.86]Real McChicken wink.
[266:10.62]I want something.
[266:11.82]I want something delicious.
[266:15.43]I want something that's 10 out of 10.
[266:17.73]But I can't eat.
[266:19.23]I'm trying to stay away from bread.
[266:24.37]Oh, shit.
[266:27.51]What am I going to eat?
[266:30.32]Wait, dresser, right?
[266:31.16]Here we go.
[266:35.22]Hey, look.
[266:37.64]Searches.
[266:37.92]Hey, hey, hey.
[266:38.46]Check it out.
[266:38.78]Check it out.
[266:39.04]Check it out.
[266:40.00]I got it.
[266:40.26]Invisibility spell.
[266:41.59]Reveal invisible green.
[266:49.73]Hash house.
[266:51.57]Stuffed blue cheeseburger, but replace buns with lettuce wraps.
[267:04.02]There we go.
[267:14.24]There's a new page.
[267:15.65]Oh, it's a gun!
[267:17.97]Take it.
[267:18.13]A journey into darkness.
[267:38.72]Did you seriously forget that you shat yourself earlier?
[267:42.00]Good callback to four and a half hours ago.
[267:44.20]The beast.
[268:03.91]How long is the game?
[268:04.78]I don't know.
[268:05.76]I don't think it's that long.
[268:32.48]Ten minutes.
[268:33.22]Longer than that.
[268:34.28]I got my new book.
[268:35.68]Gun on.
[268:35.88]This gun looks tiny.
[269:08.58]The ancients influence 13 hours, according to how long to be from all walks of life to all parts of the world.
[269:15.36]Their tendrils crept and wrought.
[269:17.69]1983.
[269:17.93]Their prisons decayed constantly as their guardians work continued.
[269:25.81]I discovered mention of a breakthrough in satellite radar imaging that reveal the presence of a hitherto unknown temple mound in the Angkor Thom region of Cambodia.
[269:36.93]An archaeologist of some repute, Dr. Edwin Lindsay, took it upon himself to investigate the area.
[269:46.58]1983.
[269:47.88]Unfortunately, the local government at the time thought differently, requiring that Lindsay find other means into the country and to finance the expedition.
[269:58.24]He found these in Paul Augustine, a collector of rare items who professed an interest in the discovery and agreed to help.
[270:08.53]This is like Indiana Jones.
[270:10.19]There's a bunch of traps in this one.
[270:13.71]I mean, that's just the guy from Indiana Jones on the right.
[270:17.05]No, I'm thinking of the judge from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[270:39.50]For years, I have searched for it without success.
[270:43.04]Oh, that's it, isn't it?
[270:44.14]Yeah, no, that's true.
[270:46.18]It's beneath the great ancient's insidious magic.
[270:49.39]I am very pleased with your performance.
[270:51.41]It's Mr. X. Mr. X before the roids.
[270:55.11]In fact, so pleased that I will give you an early bonus.
[271:12.14]My God!
[271:20.12]You are a scholar, Dr. Lindsay, not a warrior.
[271:24.03]In that regard, I have several centuries more experience than you.
[271:31.19]Don't be a fool.
[271:33.01]Die quietly, and you will not suffer.
[271:40.49]Oh, he's got... Oh, he's... It's... It's Augustine.
[271:45.06]Okay, Resident Evil.
[272:10.78]Why would you aim there?
[272:11.66]Wait till he opens up?
[272:15.52]Okay, wait till I shoot him in the stomach.
[272:30.93]Wait, what's going on?
[272:37.21]Don't meet your stomach again, please.
[272:41.36]WHOA!
[272:45.76]Of course, this Guardian sucks.
[272:53.07]Open!
[273:11.84]Open!
[273:13.52]Open!
[273:20.57]Dead?
[273:20.89]Okay, finally.
[273:23.59]Jesus!
[273:23.95]Alright, somebody just said, this is just like your colonoscopy.
[273:40.52]I'm reaching to try to find out what that means.
[273:42.46]This is just like your colonoscopy.
[273:55.28]Okay, warn of bronze dust.
[274:06.03]Let's get out of here.
[274:11.57]Wait, reveal invisible?
[274:14.89]Wait, I have a broom?
[274:15.91]I don't know if I had all this other stuff.
[274:18.98]I have a shotgun?
[274:19.76]Okay, cool.
[274:22.10]I don't have any spells.
[274:26.84]Oh, I need to find the book first.
[274:28.06]Okay.
[274:30.62]Where do I go?
[274:32.83]Thick layer of dust obscures the...
[274:44.92]There's the bronze bracelet.
[274:45.86]Pick it up.
[274:46.16]There's a lot that goes on in chat that Jerma doesn't address.
[275:05.47]It can be hard to address everything going on.
[275:08.87]Get away from me.
[275:15.67]That's a hundred dollars.
[275:21.08]Who just gave a hundred bucks?
[275:23.74]Shanji just gave 10,000 bits.
[275:25.36]A hundred fucking bucks.
[275:29.24]Thank you for the hundred dollars.
[275:30.46]Internal fart.
[275:31.62]Internal fartness.
[275:32.41]Jerm is rectum.
[275:35.95]Eternal fartness.
[275:36.91]Right.
[275:37.75]Well, thank you for the hundred bucks, dude.
[275:39.57]Seriously.
[275:41.77]Miss Karim.
[275:44.08]We all get consumed by the old gods.
[275:49.02]See?
[275:50.88]They make a statue out of all of us.
[275:52.06]There's another one here.
[275:52.80]Look.
[275:54.05]Droidus.
[275:54.47]Three more pedestals?
[276:14.10]Stop stepping on those faces.
[276:15.22]They're in pain.
[276:19.87]Yeah.
[276:20.25]Alright, let's do an invisibility check.
[276:27.21]What would it be?
[276:27.61]Green or... I don't know.
[276:29.29]Red?
[276:38.75]That sounded like something opened.
[276:55.85]What is that?
[276:57.03]A kukri?
[277:00.87]Is there an explanation for why the characters know the spells?
[277:09.13]Well, it's my understanding that these guys pick up the book and then they kind of just know everything because the book fucks their brain and I'm apparently walking through this without getting hurt.
[277:21.96]Okay.
[277:24.30]It absorbs into your body and your brain and stuff and it gets... Uh, give me that.
[277:44.21]Shit.
[277:50.46]Doing a real bad job of stealing.
[277:54.05]Red.
[277:54.39]I need red damage, right?
[278:05.44]Put it on the kukri.
[278:08.14]Play Bass Pro Fishing?
[278:15.75]That didn't work.
[278:29.71]I love fishing games.
[278:30.59]I can't move this guy.
[278:39.44]Alright, just stop getting hurt and go.
[278:47.89]I'm a big fan of fishing games.
[278:48.97]Remember the PC fishing game?
[278:59.50]I just got pre-fired.
[279:00.32]I definitely want mana.
[279:12.21]I'm so excited for tomorrow.
[279:15.79]I am mentally preparing myself for tomorrow because it's been so long.
[279:20.39]I went into the green screen like three and a half months ago.
[279:23.70]I cannot wait.
[279:26.30]And I've been a good boy too.
[279:27.44]I haven't watched anything.
[279:29.88]I did initially.
[279:30.86]I did.
[279:31.12]I could help myself.
[279:31.92]I watched a few things initially, but I've been very, very good.
[279:44.81]What time tomorrow?
[279:45.49]Somewhere around 11 o'clock in the morning.
[279:49.58]Pacific.
[279:56.78]Okay, let's do this again.
[279:59.77]I have another necklace.
[280:00.55]Okay, let's go... Where is it?
[280:10.48]Where is it?
[280:10.76]There it is.
[280:15.22]I can't go back to Fishing Clinic because Fortnite Jimmy has not forgiven you.
[280:21.94]Unfortunate.
[280:23.90]What about the bird watching stream?
[280:27.40]Yeah, there's...
[280:30.66]There are so many different things to do.
[280:32.78]I just need to do them.
[280:34.88]Another bracelet.
[280:43.59]Is it a bad thing or a good thing?
[280:48.11]Why'd you shoot at me?
[280:49.13]Hey!
[280:49.95]What the fuck are you doing?
[280:59.38]to give it back?
[281:02.06]Wait, don't I have a shitty one?
[281:16.93]Alright, I'll give it back.
[281:18.19]Fine.
[281:18.51]I can't.
[281:22.65]Can somebody help me, please?
[281:25.35]Well, I gotta replace that with something.
[281:33.29]Is that the way to go?
[281:33.81]Do you want me to auto or just wait that way?
[281:56.46]Can you do the auto laugh?
[281:59.44]What is auto's laugh?
[282:01.84]The auto laugh?
[282:16.80]What?
[282:17.02]Stop!
[282:24.55]Alright, just put the... Knock him down!
[282:38.78]I want that rune!
[282:43.39]Ooh, the laugh.
[282:44.43]He doesn't have a laugh.
[282:48.52]Auto laugh?
[282:50.42]I don't think what that means.
[282:52.32]Auto's laugh.
[283:01.07]Oh, okay.
[283:02.09]When he goes like, whatever, right?
[283:06.87]I can't just do that right now.
[283:09.51]I can't.
[283:13.04]I can't do that right now.
[283:14.27]I'm just like chilling playing a game.
[283:16.13]I can't just like start doing the auto lap.
[283:24.87]Wait, what's that?
[283:34.46]Funny man.
[283:35.04]Funny man.
[283:35.58]Funny man.
[283:38.84]Wait, is that...
[283:42.24]Something's hiding there?
[283:43.07]Can I burn it?
[284:00.68]Burn it!
[284:09.52]This chapter has a miserable rune that you can end up not having for the rest of the game, by the way.
[284:13.94]Oh god, that's not good.
[284:15.52]Use the brush.
[284:20.44]Is that the rune you were talking about?
[284:33.69]Dispel magic.
[284:39.35]Oh, I can dispel magic on that guy now.
[284:41.81]I got to stand there.
[284:42.56]This guy.
[284:47.80]Spell red.
[284:50.56]Shotgun equipped and reloaded.
[284:57.13]Like what?
[284:57.47]I can't just reload the gun?
[285:03.15]I'm just preparing.
[285:03.83]The guy's watching me prepare all this.
[285:05.27]Okay, he's loading up the gun.
[285:07.57]He's opening his spell book.
[285:13.22]Should I do anything about this or just stand?
[285:15.08]I don't have the runes.
[285:16.68]Fuck, really?
[285:30.39]Use it!
[285:35.12]What happened to my head?
[285:39.80]I lost an arm?
[285:44.94]Now I'm just the Tofu from Resident Evil.
[285:50.49]Hold on.
[286:00.19]Give me one second.
[286:01.05]I have to pee.
[286:02.40]Bad.
[288:53.37]It's all good.
[288:56.63]Alright, what do I need?
[288:59.66]I need to get that necklace.
[289:03.34]I need to have to dispel magic on that guy.
[289:05.02]Wait, okay.
[289:09.54]My character freaked out.
[289:10.46]Alright, dispel magic.
[289:13.77]I don't have to fucking ruin.
[289:15.19]Right.
[289:15.39]Can we save this for real so I don't ruin everything when I play this again?
[289:22.27]Great.
[289:24.27]Here's the bush.
[289:36.39]I tried to do that.
[289:41.39]Minus one.
[289:42.29]I didn't say anything that wasn't funny.
[289:48.58]I'm going back to fucking 1983.

[290:50.59]You know what I would love for a video game?
[290:53.11]It would be so much fun if there was a game just about trying to avoid traps in a room.
[290:59.70]Like, just make a game with this same character in the same environment, but all the rooms are traps.
[291:05.90]And it's very clever.
[291:07.01]You have to get... No, not like saw.
[291:13.21]This ruin.
[291:13.81]What do you need to put on here?
[291:20.61]Shit.
[291:24.57]Play Minesweeper.
[291:25.45]I don't want to play Minesweeper.
[291:27.59]Wait, what's this blue thing?
[291:30.45]Invisible blue, invisible green.
[291:52.28]Feel invisible green, right?
[291:55.44]Eliminate all the spiderwebs.
[292:04.27]Fuck.
[292:17.30]Did I miss the spiderweb back there?
[292:23.73]I'm just looking at the ground.
[292:24.45]I'm looking for webs.
[292:32.32]No.
[292:40.56]No webs here, right?
[292:44.54]Oh, shit.
[292:47.34]Go back.

[292:48.22]Go back.
[292:48.42]Give me that bracelet.
[293:05.88]Just get hit by everything.
[293:06.74]Doesn't matter.
[293:07.04]I can just heal instantly.
[293:14.78]I can heal.
[293:15.38]I'm going to be fine.
[293:17.40]Okay, let's go in here.
[293:20.49]Where the hell is it?
[293:26.65]Put the metal one on and then put that one on the... This is going to be a pain in the ass, isn't it?
[293:31.13]Okay, here we go.
[293:32.45]Alright.
[293:32.61]Give me it.
[293:37.70]Silver, put the metal one on here.
[293:46.07]Okay, good.
[293:49.41]Just a web.
[293:49.97]I don't see a web.
[293:59.25]Those are bones.
[294:00.59]Oh, that's a fucking web on the ground.
[294:02.11]Okay, that looked... I thought that was bones.
[294:04.13]I don't know why.
[294:04.73]No, go back here.
[294:14.94]There it is.
[294:17.03]Okay.
[294:20.45]Spell magic.
[294:28.25]And I can put the silver bracelet on that lady's neck in the hallway down here.
[294:32.46]And I can dispel magic on that guy.
[294:38.52]Let's get a good save here.
[294:39.86]What do you mean?
[294:44.15]Can't use that, huh?
[294:55.77]I need four bracelets.
[294:57.13]I'm gonna write in all caps, illegal emulator.
[295:10.76]Illegal, that's illegal.
[295:16.87]Oh God.
[295:19.63]Okay, let's do dispel magic, red.
[295:32.84]Give me that.
[295:34.03]Silver necklace, pick it up.
[295:41.49]Shotgun.
[295:43.87]This guy's so dead.
[296:07.32]Yeah!
[296:10.74]Dodge roll?
[296:11.32]No, sorry, this is before every video game had that.
[296:13.70]Cool, now I have the necklace.
[296:20.80]Go back here, put the necklace on, and maybe that'll open?
[296:24.91]Do not die here.
[296:31.91]Uncle Pop Rod.
[296:38.31]Necklace.
[296:40.65]Can it work?
[296:42.65]Thank God I don't have to get three more of these damn things.
[296:44.61]Illegal.
[297:05.20]Rune.
[297:06.68]Give me.
[297:12.79]We cleared the second cobweb that was on the first floor.
[297:16.71]Um... I don't know.
[297:19.60]Is that what this is?
[297:24.16]The minus one?
[297:24.72]Did I get it?
[297:31.96]He's fine with cobwebs?
[297:32.83]Okay, good.
[297:38.89]Shotgun back on.
[297:47.27]So, remind me again.
[297:48.67]Depending on what you pick.
[297:52.85]Depending on what character or what color you pick.
[297:55.33]That's the enemies that are in the game.
[297:58.20]Right?
[298:03.12]Yes.
[298:09.72]Wait, really?
[298:10.12]That's pretty cool.
[298:10.70]Yeah.
[298:12.45]It is kind of cool.
[298:21.14]The green is the most fun, is it?
[298:29.21]Changes what order you get the color runes, I think.
[298:34.53]Oh, okay.
[298:40.66]Green affects sanity more.
[298:41.76]Hmm.
[298:48.78]Whatever, I made it.
[299:17.29]Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing.
[299:20.85]Why do I need to swing?
[299:24.39]This is gold.
[299:24.99]It's probably going to say give that back, right?
[299:38.06]Carrying something valuable.
[299:39.92]I can't pick it up.
[299:43.06]As you can carve granite.
[299:45.42]A ceremonial temple guard appears to be keeping watch on the seated goddess in the corner of the room.
[299:50.51]How do I turn it?
[299:51.19]Like this.
[299:58.95]It's not scary at all.
[300:11.20]I got it.
[300:11.54]I think it's on a timer.
[300:13.30]Get out.
[300:17.35]Am I good?
[300:20.49]I have another silver bracelet.
[300:21.69]Where does this one go?
[300:30.09]What the hell?
[300:30.83]There appears to be a hole in the wall, but it is large enough for a small dog to pass through.
[300:37.15]Is there a shrinking spell?
[300:39.38]I'm being poisoned.
[300:54.53]I'm fucking around there.
[300:59.07]Dirty dick spell.
[301:03.07]Hey, dispel blue... Just back away from this damn thing.
[301:18.97]I need to dispel magic.
[301:20.59]Dispel magic red, right?
[301:23.91]What's the point of these enemies?
[301:26.70]I can't even... Fuck out of my game.
[301:39.59]I can't even finish him because he's inside of this stupid thing.
[301:42.27]He's inside of the wall.
[301:48.17]Alright, Dispel Magic, Red, right?
[301:53.93]Um... I did not tell him to shoot the shotgun.
[301:56.95]No, no, he shot it.
[301:57.73]That was on his own.
[302:05.56]Green.
[302:06.48]Green is what I meant to do.
[302:07.36]Red.
[302:19.23]Oh God.
[302:21.47]I've got to dispel all these.
[302:23.17]I don't even know where the hell they are.
[302:36.50]Small basin or font situated beneath the statue beside that an orb shaped button sits on a panel.
[302:42.20]Press the button?
[302:42.94]Yeah.
[302:51.20]Water smells like acid.
[302:52.16]I have to put something in there to pick up... I don't want to do it again.
[303:04.16]What can I do with that?
[303:13.57]Do I have a cup?
[303:21.44]I can't hold acid in anything.
[303:24.08]Put your hand in it.
[303:29.24]I'm not going to put my hand in the basin.
[303:37.75]Wait.
[303:38.23]Wrong way.
[303:41.47]When's monkey ball?
[303:44.23]Very, very, very soon.
[303:49.75]Wait, is this the wrong way?
[303:53.69]Oh, wait, is it?
[303:57.05]I'm so identical.
[303:58.49]Is it this one?
[304:00.27]It's this one, right?
[304:05.20]Yeah, Super Monkey Ball is gonna- I'm gonna probably 100% that game.
[304:13.50]Shit, I stepped in the goddamn gas.
[304:14.94]Ooh!
[304:15.82]Ooh!
[304:19.03]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[304:21.89]I need a... Shit, run.
[304:29.07]Come on, I'm not going to be able to get by it.
[304:31.61]Smash!
[304:34.42]Wait, I have to... Get off!
[304:48.58]What the fuck is that?
[304:49.95]What?
[304:51.45]Oh shit, no.
[304:52.29]When was it?
[304:54.15]Oh my goodness.
[305:01.17]I gotta wait for the mana.
[305:13.72]Don't cheat.
[305:15.82]The last save was like an hour and a half ago, so I have to.
[305:33.08]Fuck.
[305:38.76]Save scoundrelio.
[305:46.36]Can I finally heal?
[306:03.28]Okay.
[306:03.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[306:04.80]Who?
[306:04.96]I don't care.
[306:05.34]I don't... Jesus Christ.

[322:51.21]Look at how long ago that was.
[322:54.86]Three hours and... Okay, that was a full almost hour and twenty minutes past.
[322:57.88]Yeah, it's probably time for me to go anyways.
[323:02.56]I really want to try to stay under this five to six hour mark.
[323:08.35]Bugs all over the screen.
[323:21.98]If I could just run.

[323:50.88]I'm doing just fine.
[324:09.10]Somebody said, why save when you are never going to play this again?
[324:13.60]You don't know that.
[324:14.98]You don't know if that's true or not.

[324:38.59]Yeah, but I've only played it for like an hour.
[324:48.69]No, I'm not... I'm gonna... Just hold on.
[324:53.94]I'm not done yet.
[324:54.54]I don't know what I just did.
[325:09.50]If I don't get hit by one thing, I get a thousand dollars.

[327:05.82]It's probably going to go for at least 5 or 6 hours.
[327:08.10]It's at least 3 or 400 videos.
[327:10.96]It's going to have to probably be over the course of 2 or 3 different days.
[327:14.87]I cannot wait.
[327:15.77]I'm so excited for it.
[327:17.87]It's going to be tons of fun.
[327:19.91]The last 2 times we've done this
[327:22.97]Tears have been streaming down my face, so I cannot imagine it'll be any different.
[327:29.15]See you tomorrow.
[327:30.67]Let's roll the credits.
[327:31.47]Thanks.

[327:46.19]We'll see you soon.
[327:47.41]Tomorrow.
[327:48.33]More specifically.
[327:51.93]Let's put the... Let's get those credits rolling.
[327:55.21]What do you say, dudes?
[327:59.58]Please tell me I didn't break it.
[328:00.60]Did I break it?
[328:04.00]I didn't break it.
[328:04.98]Yes!
[328:07.51]Yes!
[328:08.85]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[328:13.19]What am I going to do?
[328:13.91]Go to the dentist on stream.
[328:18.04]what you should have said is when am I going to be a dentist on stream and work on a pretend patient pretend we know you're an irl dentist you're promising too many streams
[328:42.25]I actually was talking to this about exactly what you're describing.
[328:46.39]So the guy that does a lot of the producing work and who is essentially coming on as somebody that can help to do a bunch of the projects with me, we talk a couple times a week.
[328:56.65]And what, unfortunately, what has happened is with the coronavirus, all these things that keep coming up and all these ideas, they're all being worked on.
[329:07.40]It just can't happen right now.
[329:10.77]And over the, in the next probably few months, next three or four months, there's going to be a lot of streams that are just going to be done and ready to go when this shit is under control.
[329:22.20]So it's going to be back to back to back to back.
[329:25.64]There's going to be probably three or four huge streams in a row because they're all have already been worked on.
[329:30.96]They're all done the last three, four months.
[329:38.15]So, when you hear about a stream that's like, hey, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.
[329:42.62]The bird stream.
[329:44.86]That may or may not have already been worked on.
[329:48.42]And is being looked into.
[329:50.18]With a bunch of other ones too.
[329:54.77]And he's like, he was laughing about it.
[329:56.07]He's like, yeah, you kind of do have a bunch of stuff that you're going to just dump back load on everybody.
[330:02.23]Because it's going to happen like three or four times in a row.
[330:05.63]I'm like, yeah, that's fine.
[330:11.26]When's the slime stream?
[330:12.84]You'll know.
[330:14.24]I'm not going to tell you who it is.
[330:16.00]I'm not going to tell you where they stream.
[330:18.04]But I'll give you a hint.
[330:27.62]Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
[330:28.32]It's going to be an exciting day.
[330:33.01]I cannot wait.
[330:33.49]I'm looking forward to it more than anything.
[330:37.03]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[330:40.37]Have a great night.
