[00:00.88]Say it now.
[00:01.88]Let's say it now.
[00:04.74]Say what now?
[00:05.28]The Drew Crew.
[00:09.46]What do they want me to do?
[00:12.69]Say it.
[00:13.31]What do you want me to say?
[00:14.23]Drew Crew coming in.
[00:15.45]Is that what you want?
[00:17.09]I want to call you the Drew Crew?
[00:24.81]Say no.
[00:25.80]Alright.
[00:27.06]We're not playing this game right now.
[00:28.72]Hello, everybody.
[00:29.18]How you doing?
[00:33.85]Welcome to another live stream.
[00:36.64]This live stream is going to be on a video game that's been shafted quite a few times over the course of the last, I want to say maybe three or four months.
[00:47.56]This keeps getting onto chat choice polls and either wins and then isn't played or loses and isn't played.
[00:58.61]So it's been stuck kind of in a limbo.
[01:03.73]We're going to be playing Signal Simulator.
[01:06.83]Pre-stream chat decided that's what was going to happen.
[01:09.93]They finally got it.
[01:11.07]After... After eliminating everything else and playing other stuff, Signal Simulator was still here.
[01:17.82]Signal Simulator has always been here.
[01:20.32]We're going to do it tonight.
[01:27.08]This game could be very, very interesting, or I might get frustrated in the first 30 minutes.
[01:33.85]I'm going to try to give it at least an hour before I freak out.
[01:40.91]If I love this game, we're going to keep playing it.
[01:42.86]If I like this game, we're going to keep playing it.
[01:44.22]If I don't like this game, we are going to do a hard pivot to something else.
[01:50.38]I'm not going to tell you what it is because then all of a sudden I'll look over and I'll see... Waiting room.
[01:56.89]Waiting room.
[01:57.51]Oh my god, a ResidentSleeper.
[01:59.55]Where is... I'm not doing that right now.
[02:02.98]It's got 20 community subs.
[02:04.02]Holy shit.
[02:06.30]A 40 actually from John Cena is killed.
[02:08.94]40 community subs.
[02:11.93]John Cena, you're a madman.
[02:13.01]Thanks for the 40 fucking subs.
[02:17.45]And who could forget Holobon Zombie for the 5 subs?
[02:21.69]Right, whatever.
[02:24.39]I'm not gonna play... I'm not gonna tell you what the next game could be.
[02:28.43]We are playing Signal Simulator.
[02:30.60]Not... Get that through your mind.
[02:37.84]What is that in Morse code?
[02:38.88]I don't know.
[02:39.24]Slow it down.
[02:39.76]Figure it out.
[02:41.50]Thank you, Radfully, for the five subs.
[02:46.69]Catboy Waiting Room.
[02:47.61]You're gonna be waiting here a little while.
[02:51.66]That's not going to happen in the next week or two.
[02:53.76]I promise you.
[02:55.58]Alright, is my cam on?
[02:56.42]Hopefully it's not.
[02:57.28]Let's find out.
[02:59.46]Let's hope it's not.
[03:01.09]If it is, I'm just covering the lens just in case.
[03:03.07]Okay, it's not on.
[03:04.03]Good.
[03:06.85]I'm getting a lot of subs right now.
[03:08.33]Thank you for the subs, everybody.
[03:10.41]Robotic Rogue.
[03:11.63]Thanks for five subs.
[03:14.79]You're going to see this over here.
[03:16.27]It says continue.
[03:17.23]I didn't play.
[03:17.91]I just want to make sure the game ran.
[03:23.34]He has the costume on.
[03:24.62]I don't have the costume on.
[03:27.85]No cam because cat costume.
[03:29.43]No, no cam because I have no cam for 85% of every livestream I've ever done.
[03:33.99]Alright, so I don't know how this game works.
[03:38.23]I'm gonna have to pay attention.
[03:39.29]I'm gonna try.
[03:39.83]You guys can't hear anything.
[03:41.43]Now you can.
[03:44.27]I'm gonna- I have to pay attention.
[03:45.62]This is a pay attention game.
[03:47.64]We have to find aliens with our satellite dishes.
[03:53.96]If we can find them, we... I don't know.
[03:56.90]I don't know what happens.
[03:58.60]I haven't played.
[04:03.02]Here we go.
[04:06.18]Signal Simulator.
[04:07.00]You guys have been waiting for this.
[04:10.79]Thanks, Jimbius, for the five subs.
[04:11.95]Appreciate it.
[04:14.83]I'm zooming.
[04:15.79]Oh, good.
[04:16.19]That's very loud.
[04:20.21]Let's fix that.
[04:22.35]Better clear solid sounds.
[04:25.63]Alright, uh, yeah, we're gonna bring that down.
[04:30.37]We're gonna bring that down just a little.
[04:35.33]Now it's too soft.
[04:36.63]What?
[04:41.02]This is full blast and this is... This is zero.
[04:46.42]This is still zero.
[04:48.18]This is still zero.
[04:50.04]This is still zero.
[04:52.58]But the last third of the bar is what actually matters?
[04:57.78]Alright, that's alright.
[04:58.42]I like that.
[04:58.84]Alright, press F to sit.
[05:06.00]Is this my, like, office or something, I would assume?
[05:09.24]System efficiency, 100%.
[05:10.78]Is that my microphone?
[05:13.91]Is there a tutorial?
[05:15.69]Press F11.
[05:18.95]Use the antenna control panel to start rotating the antennas.
[05:24.68]Azimuth will rotate the antennas horizontally.
[05:28.40]Elevation will rotate the antennas vertically.
[05:30.82]Okay, so I can rotate the antenna up and down.
[05:35.63]While the antennas are rotating, the energy consumption will increase.
[05:38.25]Antennas can be upgraded to rotate faster.
[05:41.29]We're looking for this guy.
[05:45.33]Okay.
[05:47.71]So, let's do that.
[05:48.99]Press F to press.
[05:54.94]Alright, so this is, uh, I can't even read that.
[05:58.28]Is my FOV too high or something?
[05:59.64]I can't even read this.
[06:14.10]This coffee is really hot.
[06:16.72]I don't think that's the same reaction.
[06:18.02]I think you would have a different reaction with coffee that hot.
[06:24.82]Drink it all?
[06:25.68]No, you don't- are you serious?
[06:28.97]Wait, do we- do we seriously have to, like, drink coffee in less than 10 minutes, weirdos in this chat?
[06:34.91]No.
[06:35.65]If you get a hot coffee, you sip it over the course of, like, three hours until it is warm and then cold, and then you get the gross part at the bottom that you just end up dumping into, like, the sink because it's so disgusting you refuse to drink it.
[06:49.29]The last, like, 1-2% of the coffee.
[06:51.13]Alright, how do I rotate this thing?
[06:56.54]Oh, okay.
[06:58.64]I can't... Fuck, is there like a magnifying glass?
[07:00.78]Okay, there we go.
[07:02.95]Alright, so... Azimuth.
[07:05.51]Q to decrease, press E to increase.
[07:07.81]Wait, don't rotate yet.
[07:11.15]Which one am I rotating?
[07:18.96]Press E to... Q... Um... Okay.
[07:23.16]Okay.
[07:24.56]Start rotation.
[07:26.56]E. Q. Turn it on.
[07:30.23]I... Press... I'm pressing... Okay.
[07:38.15]E. Q. How do I turn the fucking thing on?
[07:50.14]Is it not on?
[07:52.54]You're never gonna figure this out.
[07:55.03]Info, hold on, let me read this.
[07:57.84]Info monitor will provide you with information of your main systems.
[08:00.62]Okay.
[08:00.96]It's the efficiencies, performance of the systems and percent.
[08:03.90]This is like why I have like five employees.
[08:06.02]This is like one of them does this.
[08:11.65]I just walk, guys, there's somebody that does the monitor, somebody that does the signaling, somebody that does, like, the repairs, and then I walk around with an expensive suit on, with my hands in my suit pocket jacket.
[08:23.82]Both hands.
[08:25.48]Walking around, looking over at everybody's monitors.
[08:28.80]Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, dude, nice!
[08:30.18]And I shake my hands a little bit, and my hands come out, and I point.
[08:33.36]Nice, dude, nice, nice, nice, cool, cool, cool, good job, good job.
[08:35.68]Hands go back in the pockets.
[08:38.09]Walk to the next station.
[08:43.14]Use the laptop button just to access the sky scanner.
[08:47.22]Skyscanner will detect anomalies in the sky, and once analyzed, you'll be able to start detecting a signal.
[08:52.02]Okay.
[08:53.32]Laptop is for the Skyscanner.
[08:55.38]Gotta figure out how to turn the fucking computer on first.
[08:58.86]Performance of the systems in percentages.
[09:00.54]Okay.
[09:01.72]Charge efficiency.
[09:03.00]Stop ResidentSleeper-ing me.
[09:04.22]I'm trying to... I'm trying to learn the game!
[09:07.38]Recharge performance of the solar panels, cleaning them... I'm just reading and not comprehending.
[09:10.46]Stop.
[09:10.78]Here we go.
[09:12.28]Recharge performance of the solar panels.
[09:14.50]Cleaning them will increase the charge efficiency.
[09:16.36]Okay.
[09:19.01]How fast the antenna is rotating.
[09:21.79]Detection error for the signal.
[09:24.01]If the signal elevates 50 and the coordination... Oh man, I need to hire somebody for this one.
[09:28.40]I need to hire somebody for this.
[09:31.34]Range of the antenna or how close you are to position.
[09:33.18]I need to hire somebody for this one.
[09:36.22]I'll figure it out.
[09:37.84]Okay, so status is ready.
[09:39.61]Azimuth is ready.
[09:40.61]Azimuth is the name of the satellite.
[09:45.61]How do I turn the fucking machine on?
[09:49.11]Start rotation.
[09:49.97]Did I do it?
[09:55.97]Okay.
[09:57.09]On.
[09:57.95]Wait, what?
[09:58.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:59.67]Why is it like an old dryer to turn the fucking computer on that's like a hundred billion dollars?
[10:07.89]Really?
[10:08.05]Okay, 80, 80 and 82.
[10:11.71]What should we do?
[10:12.54]70, 60, 80.
[10:20.47]65, alright, 75, 82.
[10:21.01]Start.
[10:21.17]Did it do it?
[10:21.49]Where is the thing?
[10:50.10]Turn the volume up?
[10:50.72]This is getting really loud.
[10:55.85]Okay, did I do it?
[11:03.59]Oh fuck, something's going on over here.
[11:04.90]What's going on over here?
[11:09.78]I'm just like the new employee that's like, oh, do I turn this on?
[11:14.55]What's this button do?
[11:16.61]Deactivate government firewall?
[11:19.01]Oh, shucks.
[11:21.35]What's all these numbers?
[11:25.31]Access granted.
[11:26.29]Oh, whoopsie daisy.
[11:27.63]You need to scan for the signal.
[11:32.78]Alright, well, let's open up the laptop.
[11:40.20]Oh, boy.
[11:41.26]Okay.
[11:41.93]Shooter?
[11:43.93]Scanner.
[11:45.83]Oh, shit.
[11:46.17]Alright, here we go.
[11:48.19]Look at our signal.
[11:48.93]Are these every... Is this every planet and every star in the universe?
[11:57.22]Left mouse button.
[11:57.90]Scan here.
[11:59.36]Scan failed.
[12:00.32]Oh, shit.
[12:06.88]Scan failed.
[12:08.08]You must check them all.
[12:15.01]Scan failed.
[12:16.29]I have to hold it?
[12:23.09]Uh... Anomaly detected!
[12:27.42]Anomaly detected!
[12:30.02]Detected an o- I dete- Help!
[12:33.22]Boss!
[12:33.72]I detected an anomaly!
[12:35.62]What do I do?
[12:40.44]Just close the computer?
[12:41.26]What are these coordinates?
[12:42.56]711.30 Follow the arrows.
[12:44.28]What arrows?
[12:45.24]What the fucking arrows?
[12:46.66]What arrows are you talking about?
[12:48.52]Where are the arrows?
[12:49.44]Oh.
[13:13.19]now what bottom right oh shit what the fuck is that I found uh I found a planet uh polarization of the electromagnetic waves what now
[13:50.67]Alright, I'm gonna fall back.
[13:51.88]I'm gonna go to my boss with all this info.
[13:54.54]Turns out I was, like, in the middle of, like, fucking Miami somewhere.
[13:57.90]And, like, it's this guy brushing his teeth.
[14:00.66]Like, look what I found!
[14:01.26]I found aliens!
[14:01.82]You don't understand!
[14:02.90]Look where it's pointed!
[14:03.64]It's pointed!
[14:03.92]And it's like, dude, that was pointing at Miami, dude.
[14:06.38]And that's a good dude brushing his teeth.
[14:08.02]Like, you're a fucking idiot.
[14:12.65]Tune the anomaly.
[14:15.45]Something's talking.
[14:18.81]Can you hear it?
[14:22.15]visual proceeding I can hear someone speaking whoa!
[14:44.58]signal detected is my phone ringing?
[14:51.66]Yeah, what am I supposed to do?
[14:54.72]Where?
[14:56.60]Escape, escape, escape.
[14:57.54]The phone's ringing.
[14:59.29]How do I answer the phone?
[15:01.17]Shoot it down, whatever it is.
[15:02.75]Leave the PC.
[15:03.37]Leave the PC.
[15:13.04]How do I answer the phone?
[15:13.70]How do I answer that?
[15:23.63]Leave the building.
[15:24.45]Why would I leave the building right now?
[15:27.86]Signal available.
[15:28.64]Tracking available.
[15:29.42]How do I track it?
[15:37.78]Next to the laptop.
[15:40.27]Download audio data.
[15:41.87]The fuck was that?
[15:43.59]Hold on.
[15:44.35]Hold on.
[15:44.55]Let's help here.
[15:45.73]Frequency detection.
[15:46.93]Once a signal is detected with the sky scanner, you have to find the right frequency signal.
[15:50.31]When you find the coordinate detection system...
[15:53.40]Alright, what do I do here?
[15:54.30]How do I do this?
[16:01.24]Top secret.
[16:01.70]Next to the laptop?
[16:02.80]I can't pick this up.
[16:06.33]How do I pick that up?
[16:08.21]Look behind you.
[16:11.29]Wrong panel.
[16:13.03]Audio signal control.
[16:14.59]Download audio control.
[16:15.81]Should I scan this here?
[16:18.07]Manual mode, frequency lock, volume.
[16:24.90]right middle antenna detection control detection energy I don't even know what it wants me to do what does it want me to even just hit auto scan auto scan too many buttons where where where is it auto scan
[17:01.19]It's not doing anything.
[17:04.33]You have to turn on the coordinate machine?
[17:07.59]What the fuck?
[17:09.69]Left, Jerma.
[17:10.79]Alright, look, there's like a five second delay on stream.
[17:14.08]If you say, look to the left, and I go left, and you go, no, that's too far left, go to the right.
[17:17.68]I'm already over here.
[17:19.36]By the time I get to here, you say left, and by the time I get to here, you tell me to go back right.
[17:29.08]I can't even go this far!
[17:35.00]Auto scan.
[17:35.66]Once signal detected, you have to find the right frequency for the signal.
[17:38.70]Didn't I already do that?
[17:45.90]To our manual mode?
[17:49.38]Look up.
[17:50.80]It's negative 16 degrees Celsius in this room.
[17:53.66]I can die here.
[18:02.76]I do manual mode.
[18:06.24]Oh my fucking god Well, that's not Your movie what am I doing?
[18:23.27]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[18:25.26]Oh
[18:27.49]game's tutorial is like a syllabus you get in the first day of school I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing okay I
[18:54.95]You didn't read the syllabus.
[18:55.95]No, I did read the syllabus.
[18:57.67]Very much so.
[18:58.59]Just hit the auto scan.
[19:15.09]I've pressed this button I think 30 times.
[19:23.86]Give me that fucking sip of this shit.
[19:28.53]Oh, fuck.
[19:30.29]My mic is desynced because of last stream.
[19:34.51]Oh my god.
[19:35.85]It was by like almost two full seconds.
[19:37.93]Thank god you caught that.
[19:41.27]Wait, so that's another problem.
[19:42.41]Hold on a second.
[19:43.01]So I- you were telling me to go left, and I was saying I'm going left, but a full two seconds was going by before you heard it.
[19:49.50]So therefore, I was going right by the time you were telling me to go right, and I was saying left.
[19:55.74]Alright, so where the fuck do I actually go?
[19:57.12]Wait, what the fuck?
[20:01.34]Okay, hold on.
[20:02.36]Hold on, right here.
[20:06.06]And just- this is it, right?
[20:11.30]so track the coordinates no that's so funny turn the manual knob until you click green wait I got something I got something
[20:33.48]We got one!
[20:35.64]Alright, track it.
[20:36.56]Oh shit, what's going on?
[20:37.86]That's some Ghostbusters.
[20:39.00]If you don't know what that is, then oh my god.
[20:40.76]Get out of here.
[21:04.48]Alright, so I have 55... 51... Okay, hold on.
[21:10.58]There's too many things.
[21:11.38]28, 76.2.
[21:11.88]Look at the averages. 31.5...
[21:23.66]And 67.9.
[21:23.80]46.9.
[21:24.04]Alright.
[21:24.48]44.7.
[21:24.68]43.1 and 75.2.
[21:25.02]This keeps changing.
[21:26.98]Eleva- Alright, so let's go elevation.
[21:29.80]We need 77.
[21:30.44]Let's just- I'm doing 47 and 77.
[21:32.22]I don't even care.
[21:33.36]So we need 47 and 77.
[21:57.76]And then 77.
[22:02.47]Okay, here we go.
[22:04.43]It's time to go.
[22:06.14]I've found the coordinate.
[22:07.32]I've found the alien.
[22:28.30]FTP is running.
[22:29.02]I have unlimited services.
[22:31.40]FTP connections.
[22:32.42]Why are there like 2,000 people connected to me?
[22:36.09]Okay, is it there?
[22:37.03]Did I go into this completely blind?
[22:41.37]Yes, 100%.
[22:42.37]I have no idea what's going on.
[22:43.75]Absolutely no clue.
[22:45.57]I downloaded it and then I turned it on and turned the stream on.
[22:47.63]Okay, so tracking available.
[22:49.69]Is that... Are we good?
[22:54.43]coordinates the system will activate when a signal is detected in the sky yeah once the system is activated it will give you coordinates within the range based on the coordinate detection system you can switch between different visual layers using the coordinate detection control panel okay now but now what we're at 47 77 48 to 7 maybe a little okay 48 point no this is accurate
[23:23.63]Now I have to go to the coordination detection panel.
[23:27.21]So it's on.
[23:30.22]Okay.
[23:31.32]Oh shit, there it is.
[23:32.04]Alright, so we gotta go up a little more.
[23:39.66]We need to go to... Um...
[23:47.74]Up and right.
[23:49.04]What is up and right though?
[23:53.20]42?
[23:53.22]42 and then 80.
[23:53.82]Alright, 42, 80.
[23:59.53]42, 80.
[23:59.73]Go.
[24:05.93]We good?
[24:10.12]We're spinning?
[24:10.96]Okay, then we're gonna go up.
[24:20.25]It's not instant.
[24:22.17]Oh.
[24:27.16]I watch as he moves the elevation bars to the right.
[24:31.56]Um, okay.
[24:37.50]Go for a walk in the meantime.
[24:38.82]What do you mean go for a walk in the meantime?
[24:40.69]Should I get up from my desk?
[24:46.23]Are you sure?
[24:47.47]I feel like I'm almost there.
[24:48.45]I'm in the bullseye.
[24:55.69]Look at the center console.
[25:01.88]Oh, Azimuth is at 41.
[25:05.36]We need Azimuth to be at 51.
[25:08.32]Oh, crap.
[25:21.13]Go, go, go, go, go.
[25:24.53]I'm gonna get you, and when I get you, I'm gonna get you.
[25:26.70]50 and 75.
[25:28.42]What do we got?
[25:30.52]70, 51.
[25:31.20]We need elevation to be at 75.
[25:37.45]Go ahead.
[25:38.21]51, 75.
[25:38.25]We almost there?
[25:41.61]That's like, we're right there.
[25:42.61]51, 75.
[25:42.93]Alright, come on.
[25:44.07]What the fuck?
[25:44.63]Where is this thing?
[25:45.25]53, it's like right here.
[25:52.91]Can I track?
[25:53.83]Tracked coordinates.
[25:54.57]Can I do attention detail?
[25:58.91]48, 78.
[26:01.42]It's not a fucking scope.
[26:04.72]Alright, I can finally watch my favorite streamer.
[26:08.62]Start at the minimum and then go to the maximum.
[26:14.56]Wait, what?
[26:15.10]29 and 64?
[26:16.72]That's not what I do.
[26:18.88]Why would I do that?
[26:24.22]No, that's not how this works.
[26:27.23]Okay, what is making that sound?
[26:28.61]Because I want to turn it down.
[26:30.23]Oh, fuck!
[26:30.69]What happened?
[26:33.39]I thought that was volume!
[26:35.77]Shit, did I mess that up?
[26:36.63]Alright, but what am I- Alright.
[26:43.25]How do I turn this fucking sound off?
[26:46.71]Oh, thank God.
[26:47.50]Okay.
[26:55.99]but what am I trying to do am I trying to get this blue circle in the middle I can't track coordinates or anything no it's time for a hard pivot Andy um we'll see maybe go back on the laptop
[27:24.88]Put the elevation up a little more.
[27:26.00]Okay.
[27:29.96]79.
[27:30.14]Go for it.
[27:34.19]Elevation.
[27:34.77]60.
[27:35.99]I can't even read this circle.
[27:43.53]Don't get discouraged.
[27:45.54]No, I'm just... I feel like this is one of those games where you have to sit here for like an hour or two before you understand how the game even works.
[27:56.28]Go up, not down.
[27:57.22]Wait, I didn't go up?
[28:04.68]What is detection control?
[28:05.96]Do I have any more tutorials?
[28:09.67]No.
[28:11.99]You switch between different visual layers.
[28:13.41]Yeah, I thought I did that.
[28:14.99]Hold on.
[28:16.87]No.
[28:20.35]One or two hour ResidentSleeper.
[28:22.23]Okay.
[28:25.25]I can't track these coordinates because it's not in there.
[28:27.07]The board is right there.
[28:32.51]I mean, look, you can't sit me down in front of your school project that I've never been to one class of yours.
[28:39.31]Like, you're in a fucking geology class, and you sit me down in all this shit that I don't know, and you go, hey, can you do my homework for me?
[28:46.20]It's right there.
[28:46.90]It's right there.
[28:47.62]You don't know that?
[28:49.56]No, I don't know.
[28:50.08]You have like 10 monitors, dude.
[28:51.42]And I have not sat in one of your college classes.
[28:54.24]I have no fucking idea what's happening.
[28:59.02]In fact, you're going to get an F. Do your work.
[29:02.04]Don't tell me to do this.
[29:02.90]Do your own work.
[29:10.49]I'm missing something here.
[29:11.85]I feel like I need to do this.
[29:18.80]Wallace and Gromit waiting room.
[29:19.98]You can scroll down on that tutorial page again.
[29:23.22]There's nothing here.
[29:23.82]So what it- okay, what is the goal of me trying to hit this average here?
[29:32.83]It's 4875.
[29:33.21]Wait, what do you mean actually pretending?
[29:44.19]Scroll on the right.
[29:45.57]Oh my fucking god.
[29:49.21]Like, alright, I have a criticism here.
[29:51.79]This is a criticism for the game.
[29:55.14]What's all this space for?
[29:56.72]What's the point of this space?
[29:58.04]What is the point of this space?
[30:00.56]Why do I need to scroll down past like a paragraph of empty space?
[30:04.14]What's the point of that?
[30:04.82]It can't just be right here?
[30:16.81]Oh, he's a real critic.
[30:19.58]Okay.
[30:20.52]Azimuth min plus coordinate detection equals possible signal.
[30:24.82]From that point start lowering the current position or wait until a new lower azimuth is detected.
[30:29.62]Okay.
[30:30.86]So we go to the minimum like that person said.
[30:33.06]We start lowering.
[30:40.07]I heard like a fucking animal.
[30:45.95]Okay, what's the minimum? 27.3
[30:57.08]Okay, 27.3.
[30:57.62]Alright, here we go.
[31:01.07]What do we got?
[31:04.77]Anything?
[31:08.81]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, it's not, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:12.82]Check the bathroom.
[31:13.64]Why would I go to the bathroom?
[31:15.00]No, no, no, no, no, that's wrong.
[31:17.58]No.
[31:17.68]Wait a minute.
[31:20.00]Wait a minute.
[31:22.67]Wait a minute.
[31:30.80]Oh.
[31:35.03]Uh.
[31:35.13]29, minimum 62.
[31:36.75]We're just gonna go up from here.
[31:44.63]Remember, the bars on the left try to fill them.
[31:58.69]Azimuth elevation signal strength.
[32:01.77]Well, what the fuck is this thing?
[32:07.18]Okay, that, I gotta... What do you mean I had it?
[32:18.75]Check the azimuth didalis.
[32:28.85]It was green.
[32:29.67]What was it?
[32:30.01]How do you mean it was green?
[32:35.69]Launch the nuke.
[32:42.14]Okay, so I'm going to go 2786.
[32:43.00]Did I go by 2786?
[32:43.66]Somebody said it was green before.
[32:45.36]Was it?
[32:58.06]When both these are fully green, you have the signal.
[32:59.90]Why wouldn't they even be a little green?
[33:01.06]The thing is right here.
[33:01.83]We'll go back to 50.
[33:09.67]Alright, let's go 32.
[33:13.27]I'm just trying to get the azimuth.
[33:21.31]I don't care about the elevation right now.
[33:29.42]33.
[33:29.52]Alright, 33.
[33:31.22]Go back.
[33:31.68]I gotta go up.
[33:32.74]I'm gonna go 35.
[33:39.20]Where's the alien?
[33:39.88]I don't know.
[33:42.62]This is like learn how to fly a plane in the first day of class.
[33:47.24]No green at all?
[33:48.08]How?
[33:48.36]27.
[33:49.46]Alright.
[33:50.66]I'm gonna go back up to like 48.
[34:00.62]It's still red.
[34:01.24]Why is it red?
[34:02.34]Check the bathroom.
[34:03.19]I'll go to the bathroom in a minute.
[34:04.27]I need to get to, like, the first alien.
[34:07.61]Let me get to the first alien first, and then I'll go to the bathroom.
[34:11.11]What happened?
[34:12.83]What the fuck happened?
[34:14.85]What happened?
[34:15.45]Why is it broken?
[34:16.09]What happened?
[34:16.45]I mean, I lost the signal.
[34:37.15]They took too much time.
[34:40.21]You think they would want to ease you into this shit?
[34:43.71]No, just sit down at the battle station.
[34:47.87]I'm going to the fucking bathroom.
[34:56.07]No, I know, this is one of those games where this game over there doesn't mean anything.
[35:00.34]This is a fake game.
[35:02.37]This is a horror game.
[35:03.57]I'm gonna like have to sleep and this guy I'm gonna be like I'm gonna hear noises in the kitchen and shit.
[35:08.11]I know what this is.
[35:08.99]This is a fake game.
[35:10.85]This is a fake game.
[35:12.85]And then I'm gonna have to there's a scary alien monster that I have to avoid.
[35:16.31]Okay.
[35:19.37]Yeah.
[35:19.99]Right.
[35:20.38]Okay.
[35:21.06]Fake game.
[35:21.58]Game's not even real.
[35:22.74]This is like a runaway from the monster and it's just for show.
[35:39.02]Get a coffee?
[35:42.28]Where's the audio?
[35:43.78]What the fuck is going on here?
[35:45.19]Are we mowing the lawn?
[35:54.03]Did I leave the computer on all night?
[36:07.68]That's the alien.
[36:10.78]Oh shit, avoid the alien.
[36:13.02]Open the server rack.
[36:19.51]Connection with the main server established.
[36:29.44]I don't know about this one.
[36:37.62]Alright, where's the bathroom?
[36:40.38]This is the fire exit.
[36:41.55]Wait, why can I go outside?
[36:55.82]Where is the bathroom?
[36:58.50]What is this doing?
[36:59.18]Is this dropping like a package?
[37:04.94]Oh, this is fantastic, dude.
[37:06.58]Everybody playing on this server is gonna fucking just be swarming this area right now.
[37:10.60]Once this drops.
[37:12.96]Great.
[37:19.87]Had a good spot here, too.
[37:20.99]What's it doing?
[37:28.32]Wait, what?
[37:38.58]That was an Amazon delivery.
[37:39.80]Is that a helicopter right there?
[37:44.14]Can I fly that?
[37:50.77]Okay.
[37:52.35]I still don't even understand what the hell I'm supposed to do.
[37:55.33]Where's the bathroom?
[37:56.05]Is everyone saying check the bathroom?
[38:00.90]Alright, I checked the bathroom.
[38:01.76]There's nothing in the bathroom.
[38:04.26]There you go.
[38:05.14]Bathroom has been checked.
[38:19.34]Okay, cool.
[38:30.60]What do you mean plus one letter grade?
[38:32.20]For a bathroom?
[38:32.90]What are you talking about?
[38:33.62]Alright, well I checked it.
[38:41.86]I need to find at least one alien.
[38:43.52]I still don't get it.
[38:45.44]I don't fucking get it.
[38:47.04]I'm trying to get it.
[38:48.00]I don't get it.
[38:49.84]We gotta start from the beginning again.
[38:51.18]Alright, so what do you start?
[38:54.82]Um... I don't get it.
[38:59.70]I don't get it.
[39:00.40]You gotta go on the laptop. ...
[39:13.98]Ooh, okay.
[39:22.32]There it is, alright.
[39:23.06]I got the first part done.
[39:24.77]Found... Oh, that's fucking Jerma Jupiter.
[39:32.57]Okay, tune the frequency.
[39:33.89]Let's get a frequency here.
[39:38.26]I understand this part.
[39:52.58]What the fuck?
[39:54.24]That's not it?
[39:57.38]I got it.
[39:57.70]That part's done.
[40:02.93]Okay, detected the signal.
[40:04.79]Now, disconnect.
[40:06.69]Here we go.
[40:07.23]I got a whole day to figure this out.
[40:09.71]We got... I don't know.
[40:12.39]I forget.
[40:12.93]What's the next part?
[40:21.15]I don't know what the next... What's the next part?
[40:23.37]I forget.
[40:25.49]Frequency.
[40:26.61]Oh, yum yum yum yum.
[40:28.80]Tracking available?
[40:31.42]How?
[40:33.62]Tracking available.
[40:34.82]Track that.
[40:35.18]Track it.
[40:35.52]Track it.
[40:35.94]Track that.
[40:36.30]Track that coordination.
[40:38.16]Track it.
[40:39.44]Auto scan.
[40:41.34]Auto scan.
[40:41.82]Stop.
[40:43.28]Track the coordinates.
[40:46.22]Manual mode.
[40:47.42]Turn off auto scan.
[40:56.96]Got it.
[40:57.20]14.7.8.2.
[40:58.16]Okay, here we go.
[41:02.36]This is the part that I have trouble with.
[41:05.36]We need to go.
[41:07.18]I've got plenty of time.
[41:07.82]Let's go.
[41:08.90]30, was it?
[41:09.75]32 and 53.72.
[41:10.31]53.72.
[41:11.05]Let's go.
[41:15.51]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[41:22.67]What's going on?
[41:23.13]Track the coordinates.
[41:23.73]I can do that?
[41:27.90]Fuck, what happened?
[41:40.01]Did I have it?
[41:40.65]Why are these not green?
[41:41.63]I thought you guys said I could only track the coordinates if these were fully green.
[41:52.92]Is that a lie?
[42:08.91]I'm just pretending to drink coffee now.
[42:12.57]This is not moved at all.
[42:18.97]He's never gonna make it to 6 a.m.
[42:22.91]This is the part that I don't understand.
[42:24.53]So I'm at 5574.
[42:28.74]Shouldn't there be at least some strength at all on either one of these two things?
[42:36.56]You need help.
[42:37.34]Call Joel.
[42:37.98]You need help.
[42:38.72]What do you mean, call Joel?
[42:43.28]I don't have just Joel on speed dial be like, Joel, hey, answer the phone every time.
[42:46.82]Hey, listen to me.
[42:51.04]He might be eating dinner.
[42:52.33]He might be busy.
[42:53.13]He might be streaming.
[42:58.82]I'm not going to interrupt somebody's dinner with my annoying, hey, I don't understand how to do geology.
[43:10.62]Hey, hey, Joel, help me with my geology homework.
[43:13.88]Can I copy yours?
[43:17.94]And here's the best part.
[43:19.64]I'm pretty sure Joel played this like five months ago.
[43:24.48]So I need to copy Joel's geometry homework from five months ago.
[43:29.19]I think I got an F in the class already.
[43:35.29]Okay, so let me get back to this.
[43:37.27]Is it something to do with this?
[43:43.47]I feel like it's something to do with this and I'm not doing it.
[43:44.95]It's still rotating.
[43:51.52]Well, hurry the fuck up.
[43:52.42]This thing's worth a trillion dollars.
[43:53.68]It can't turn faster than that.
[44:08.47]Okay, we're at 53.76.
[44:11.29]Oh, fuck.
[44:12.01]Oh, fuck.
[44:12.73]Oh, my God.
[44:13.47]Oh, my God.
[44:14.31]Oh, my God.
[44:15.19]Oh, my God.
[44:15.65]Okay.
[44:16.13]As it's... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:17.53]We're at 53.
[44:17.81]53.
[44:17.83]We're gonna go 52.
[44:22.71]51.
[44:22.73]Go.
[44:22.93]Ah!
[44:27.14]What?
[44:38.99]Wait, why?
[44:40.15]Why?

[44:40.69]Why?
[44:40.87]Why?
[44:41.17]Why?
[44:41.31]Why?

[44:41.63]What happened?
[44:42.07]54.
[44:42.13]Go.
[44:53.15]How come it's not updating?
[44:54.70]Wait, that's what was screwing me up.
[44:56.06]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[44:58.24]54.
[44:58.26]55.
[44:58.28]Here we go.
[44:59.32]Wrong one.
[44:59.70]56.
[45:01.42]Go.
[45:05.82]Because it wasn't updating in real time.
[45:07.44]That was the problem.
[45:08.12]56.
[45:10.20]We're going to do 57.
[45:14.13]58.
[45:16.53]What happened?
[45:18.01]Wait, what the fuck happened?
[45:18.95]What happened?
[45:19.31]It was just almost all the way up here.
[45:20.57]What the fuck happened?
[45:21.15]What's going on?
[45:21.83]56.
[45:21.85]Go back.

[45:23.15]55.2.
[45:23.19]What is going on?
[45:51.50]Wasn't this just right here?
[45:52.46]55.2.
[45:54.96]Do I have to go back to 54?
[45:56.00]54.2.
[45:57.64]Alright, wait a minute.
[45:58.10]54.23.

[47:13.56]I'm just puked.
[47:13.90]Okay, 50.
[47:14.08]Why am I gonna puke?

[47:51.90]Done.
[47:52.18]Alright.
[47:57.11]Elevation time.
[47:59.59]What the fuck?
[48:17.97]74, okay.
[48:18.88]Let's go to 74 elevation.
[48:19.90]I didn't know it was like this precise.
[48:34.73]I'm gonna find that alien.
[48:36.53]I'm just gonna put two hands around his neck.
[48:38.99]And then shake him back and forth and say, Give me the fucking secrets!
[48:42.65]Give me the magic secrets!
[48:50.13]Seventy... Oh, 72.
[48:52.69]Go back.
[48:58.01]Just back and forth.
[48:59.05]I know you've solved time travel.
[49:01.10]I know you have holograms.
[49:02.88]Just give it to us.
[49:08.08]Little do we know that all these aliens don't have any of this technology at all.
[49:11.96]They just figured out how to plant corn in the ground, guys.
[49:15.01]Dude, all aliens probably have, like, spaceships and crazy weapons and lasers.
[49:20.46]No, no, they just figured out farming.
[49:21.92]Like, basic 101 agriculture.
[49:24.66]We're the ones with the technology.
[49:26.02]Got news for you.
[49:32.66]Seventy... Seventy-four.
[49:35.06]Fuck.
[49:43.22]Nothing at all.
[49:48.60]Nothing at all.
[49:49.86]We're going up higher, 76.
[49:52.28]Hurry.
[49:59.32]Hurry.
[50:02.47]Fuck.
[50:02.67]74.
[50:06.79]Come on, I don't want to lose the signal.
[50:20.05]Alright, we're going all the way down.
[50:22.41]I'm going like 64.
[50:25.02]My favorite console.
[50:28.88]Hey, VYKing, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[50:31.68]StormyChew5, Jimbius5, RoboticRogue, we already got you.
[50:35.49]Thanks for the 10, though.
[50:35.99]We're fine.
[50:43.42]I get the game now.
[50:44.40]Look, it took me like 40 minutes to figure it out.
[50:46.32]It's an interesting game, and I have to figure it out.
[50:48.16]I can't just know everything.
[50:49.35]I can't just do your homework in five seconds.
[50:53.21]Lower.
[50:53.47]62.
[50:53.59]No, go up to 60.
[50:55.47]I don't know.
[51:07.92]Shit.
[51:08.20]Alright, we're going up.
[51:15.28]Minimum.
[51:15.96]Minimum.
[51:16.32]Minimum.
[51:17.62]Minimum.
[51:17.86]Minimum.
[51:20.20]Minimum.
[51:20.66]I think it's between... Yeah, I'm gonna go up.
[51:39.66]Come on, have it be high.
[51:40.58]Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[51:43.62]Well, okay, hold on.
[51:44.76]Down.
[51:46.27]Average 63.
[51:47.43]I'm going down to 63.
[51:47.99]What do you mean down?
[51:53.29]I don't know.
[51:54.13]It's hard to... 63? 62?
[52:05.81]Well, I was just going up.
[52:06.94]It's not- okay.
[52:07.68]It's not high.
[52:08.60]It's low.
[52:09.20]Go.
[52:11.04]62.
[52:13.38]You have three seconds to comply.
[52:17.66]You have three seconds to- Minimum.
[52:20.18]Minimum.
[52:21.20]Oh, fuck.
[52:21.62]I could- I could die.
[52:22.38]Hold on, wait.
[52:23.80]You have three seconds to- Minimum.
[52:26.60]Minimum.
[52:27.90]Minimum.
[52:28.82]That's an old video.
[52:29.54]No one's ever fucking seen it.
[52:30.31]Who cares?
[52:32.38]Alright, 60.
[52:32.94]Come on.
[52:33.56]Pay attention.
[52:34.14]What am I going to pay attention to?
[52:34.94]There's nothing to pay attention to yet.
[52:35.98]I have to wait like 15 seconds.
[52:44.44]Hey, how's your New Year going so far?
[52:47.38]Wait, it's loud.
[52:48.38]Too loud.
[52:48.76]I don't like it.
[53:00.05]He's scared?
[53:03.21]Not really.
[53:04.61]What's there to be afraid of?
[53:05.39]I know there's going to be a jump scare when I beat the game.
[53:08.43]It has to be, right?
[53:10.63]Why wouldn't there be?
[53:15.47]Hurry up.
[53:19.91]62.1.
[53:21.75]Nothing.
[53:23.50]How could I still have absolutely nothing? 59?
[53:36.79]How the fuck are 12k people watching this?
[53:39.51]Um... I don't know.
[53:43.09]That's a good question.
[53:44.09]Just ask them one by one.
[53:47.44]Just ask them one by one what they're doing here.
[53:49.60]Come on.
[53:55.54]56... No, it's higher.
[53:56.50]It has to be higher.
[53:57.14]It has to be, right?
[54:02.41]He's forcing us.
[54:03.17]Haha.
[54:12.89]Start with... Wait, I can't... Hold on.
[54:16.27]You guys are trying to give me help here.
[54:18.05]Start with Azimuth.
[54:18.89]Start at the minimum value.
[54:19.88]Wait for it to actually go to that position.
[54:21.38]You can check the current position.
[54:22.36]Yeah.
[54:23.10]It's at the maximum value.
[54:24.22]Start rotating through that and watch for the green bar.
[54:27.02]Stop the rotation when... I already... Um... Excuse me.
[54:34.02]What?
[54:34.48]This is full.
[54:35.14]I did that.
[54:35.46]I did it.
[54:36.38]Why give me... I did that already.
[54:41.69]Alright, so I gotta go up.
[54:43.77]Let's go 60... 64.
[54:44.13]I already did 64, but we'll do it again.
[54:47.91]What the hell are you doing?
[54:54.97]Why are you guys doing a bread recipe?
[54:59.33]Really?
[54:59.55]Get out of here.
[55:01.48]Let's change the difficulty.
[55:08.20]I could do that, but I'm already doing this.
[55:14.20]Not even a single part of that bar.
[55:16.50]Come on.
[55:16.94]69.
[55:16.96]No?
[55:17.74]70.
[55:17.82]It has to be in the 70s then.
[55:25.91]It's not.
[55:26.57]70... 71.
[55:26.61]What the fuck is happening here?
[55:27.55]72. 72.
[55:47.78]Um, 74... 75.
[56:01.29]Oh, you piece of shit.
[56:04.12]Is that...?
[56:08.70]Higher?
[56:16.62]Max is 83.
[56:17.57]The max is 80.
[56:19.23]Oh, one decimal at a time.
[56:34.54]That sounds like a painful experience.
[56:44.54]Elevation, right?
[56:45.38]That's what we're doing.
[56:45.98]We already did azimuth.
[56:47.02]This is elevation.
[56:47.84]Max is, uh, 8.
[56:48.84]Well, it just was 80.
[56:49.64]It just updated.
[56:55.64]Come on, it's almost nighttime.
[56:59.99]Really?
[57:02.67]Then it has to be, like, between 80 and 85.
[57:05.65]Nothing.
[57:06.17]Oh my fucking god.
[57:07.17]Come on, dude.
[57:07.77]Really?
[57:10.41]He's the minimum.
[57:10.95]Minimum 64.
[57:11.97]I was already down there.
[57:14.80]I did like 63, 64, 65, 66, 67.
[57:16.32]Um.
[57:16.50]There's a golf cart outside you can drive.
[57:33.56]Yeah, well I need to be able to find the signal first.
[57:37.76]Alright, I have no idea.
[57:38.80]I have no idea why I can't find this.
[57:42.64]I already did like... I did...
[57:47.05]It's 72.
[57:47.47]Oh, you don't know that.
[57:58.78]Do not skip numbers.
[58:04.64]Signal loss incoming.
[58:06.24]Fuck.
[58:06.78]I know, but I get it.
[58:07.68]This is only my second day on the job.
[58:09.20]Imagine by your third day you understand all this.
[58:12.32]I would give that person an immediate raise.
[58:14.88]They would get an immediate raise.
[58:26.81]Oh, Jesus.
[58:35.32]I can't even come close, man.
[58:37.72]What do I mean, Jerma sucks?
[58:44.18]I'm doing what you're supposed to be doing.
[58:45.65]I'm just checking decibel points.
[58:48.07]I'm just checking numbers.
[58:49.21]That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
[58:58.05]You did 71.
[58:58.77]You didn't do 73 and 74.
[58:59.99]God damn it.
[59:08.70]I'm going to lose the signal now.
[59:10.37]Not even one blip on the fucking radar.
[59:12.81]Not even a single blip.
[59:14.89]I feel like I've done every single number in between without tiny little decibels.
[59:20.02]I'm about to lose signal.
[59:24.56]You have to find the signal between 65 and 88 to the hundredth decimal point.
[59:32.54]Okay.
[59:42.47]All the way up to 86.
[59:43.45]It's gone.
[59:44.31]Fucking sick.
[59:46.15]The signal's gone.
[59:47.55]Great.
[59:49.07]Fun.
[59:54.89]Just turn the knob very gently until you find the signal.
[60:03.32]No, I'm not done.
[60:04.50]No.
[60:05.18]I'm going to find one of these signals and we're going to go do it.
[60:07.10]I'm not going to give up on it even though I am very, very upset about it.
[60:10.44]Put it on easy instead.
[60:14.82]Do you guys care if I put it on easy?
[60:16.02]I don't think I can.
[60:29.43]Nope.
[60:40.18]Lock the door, is it?
[60:41.12]Why am I still asleep?
[60:53.11]Check the bathroom.
[60:53.71]Mm-hmm.
[61:01.91]He left the doors open?
[61:04.35]So what?
[61:04.69]Guys, this is like the game Firewatch.
[61:10.31]I'm the only person here.
[61:11.79]Okay, I'm ready.
[61:20.34]Let's go.
[61:20.72]Find the signal.
[61:21.22]Go, go, go, go, go.
[61:21.86]I'm not wasting a single fucking second.
[61:23.08]I swear to God.
[61:25.08]Laptop, let's go.
[61:39.26]Hurry up.
[61:51.47]I'm going to try as hard as I can right now to find this.
[61:54.67]I know exactly what to do.
[61:55.75]It's his third day, third time's a charm.
[61:57.59]Let's find this planet.
[62:20.00]Come on!
[62:28.82]Was it higher?
[62:34.38]Why do I hear the Jerm of a raptor?
[62:35.80]Just watch a YouTube tutorial?
[62:41.28]Well, I think I already know now.
[62:43.32]The time for the YouTube tutorial was 40 minutes ago.
[62:56.15]My favorite part about the stream so far was being on a two second delay and you guys hearing me turn and say where I was going.
[63:04.75]Accidentally on like a two and a half second delay.
[63:08.59]Alright, got it.
[63:14.28]Cool, done?
[63:15.08]Alright, here we go.
[63:16.64]It's time.
[63:18.78]Find that frequency.
[63:21.68]Scan it.
[63:26.06]Damn that!
[63:31.26]Almost there?
[63:55.94]Come on, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[64:05.35]Why can't it just auto-scan?
[64:06.63]Do I not have enough power to auto-scan?
[64:09.81]Ow, my fucking ears.
[64:10.71]Do I have footsteps?
[64:16.11]That was weird.
[64:19.69]Alright, got it, got it, got it.
[64:21.81]Alright, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[64:23.03]Here we go.
[64:24.39]Let's move.
[64:26.75]What we got for an average?
[64:28.27]Now I will find the stupid frequency.
[64:30.29]We have... What the fuck?
[64:34.84]300.
[64:35.66]333.
[64:36.48]What?
[64:36.62]That's so... That's too high.
[64:38.12]325.
[64:38.42]Um...
[64:57.25]That's going to take so long.
[64:58.45]It's going to take all night.
[65:03.51]300?
[65:03.53]Don't go to the average.
[65:06.49]Alright, we're going to go.
[65:10.08]The average is 320.
[65:11.24]What was it? 312.
[65:29.76]Turn around.
[65:31.12]I'm not turning around yet.
[65:31.94]312.
[65:32.58]Alright, 306.
[65:35.56]People say go to the minimum, but the minimum changes every time.
[65:40.29]Alright, I'm going to go to 306.
[65:44.59]I can't.
[65:48.96]Well, we just have to wait for that to get to... This is going to take all night.
[65:57.68]Optimize the power box.
[65:59.26]Alright, you got it.
[65:59.70]Let's put it on antenna, right?
[66:15.80]It coins at $37,000.
[66:16.80]But I was an idiot three or four years ago.
[66:20.40]I was stupid.
[66:24.56]I was a dumb guy.
[66:31.23]You are now too.
[66:32.15]Well, sure.
[66:37.31]Bitcoin almost $40,000.
[66:38.02]Hey, remember when it was like $3,400 or $3,500 like two or three years ago?
[66:41.54]I was the idiot.
[67:04.81]What's your net worth in Bitcoin?
[67:06.79]Oh, man, I'll tell you my net worth in Bitcoin.
[67:08.83]Sick!
[67:11.13]Hey, when it dropped down to like $3,800.
[67:12.79]Oh, yeah, I told you.
[67:15.17]Here comes the crash.
[67:16.08]Oh, no, it was a scam.
[67:19.32]I held on to it for like, you know, six months and I got rid of it at like $4,500 of BCC.
[67:27.01]But that doesn't mean I was wrong.
[67:28.47]That does not mean I was wrong.
[67:29.89]That means I was right in the long term.
[67:31.53]I always knew.
[67:32.61]And guess what?
[67:33.69]I held on to one, okay?
[67:35.25]I held on to one.
[67:36.38]I still got one.
[67:37.80]I still have one.
[67:39.36]And I'm not gonna sell it until it's worth a million dollars, alright?
[67:52.05]Your azimuth is going down.
[67:53.25]What?
[68:00.72]Send power to the coordinates.
[68:02.58]Oh, shit.
[68:08.19]Why would I do that?
[68:23.51]320.
[68:23.53]Alright.
[68:23.95]Hold on.
[68:24.23]That made it better.
[68:29.61]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[68:39.15]What's your BTC wallet?
[68:48.92]Give me that coin.
[68:50.68]Use the website.
[68:51.60]What do you mean use the website?
[68:53.24]Let me check and see how my BTC is doing.
[68:56.87]Wait.
[68:57.15]Hold on.
[68:57.83]I have zero dollars.
[68:59.58]Upgrades?
[69:00.10]What?
[69:00.48]There's upgrades?
[69:01.38]Hold on.
[69:01.86]I have to look at this.
[69:04.50]Azimuth?
[69:06.26]Rotational speed increase?
[69:07.74]I don't have any money.
[69:11.02]Do I get money for this?
[69:29.36]Terminal?
[69:31.00]Database.
[69:32.30]All signals.
[69:35.06]Story signals.
[69:35.80]Random signals.
[69:38.78]Play.
[69:46.26]Where is this?
[69:48.19]Executed?
[70:07.79]I haven't found anything.
[70:09.77]Well, I'm just going to drive the car then.
[70:10.97]It's going to take like three days to get there and I'm going to lose the signal by the time it gets there.
[70:21.52]How do I leave?
[70:23.27]Out here?
[70:52.92]I'm fine.
[70:57.13]What's that?
[70:59.67]Yeah, this does get a full letter grade, but what's the point of this?
[71:25.95]You can hand crank the radar to have it go faster.
[71:28.50]What?
[71:39.72]Am I on Earth?
[71:43.33]I'm realizing this is a strange planet.
[71:49.79]Did you hear that?
[71:52.83]It was snow.
[71:53.43]It was like snow sounds, wasn't it?
[71:56.24]By the way, I don't have a left ear button.
[71:58.40]You guys know that.
[72:01.83]I do not have a left ear button.
[72:07.57]Why is it snowing out here?
[72:14.95]You missed it.
[72:16.41]What was it?
[72:20.25]It was exclusively left ear.
[72:26.61]There was an alien sound?
[72:28.05]Was it actually?
[72:28.81]Oh, one earbud Andy.
[72:37.22]Why is it all of a sudden accumulation on the ground?
[72:40.41]It just started snowing.
[73:13.87]What the hell is this for?
[73:24.31]I found my test.
[73:25.27]Can I climb this?
[73:32.33]Oh, you know, I may have found somebody else's test that they got scared.
[73:35.34]They heard Jigsaw.
[73:36.10]They threw it out in their golf cart and just didn't do the test.
[73:38.30]That would just kind of fuck up Jigsaw's whole routine, wouldn't it?
[73:45.05]I'm in my golf cart.
[73:45.73]I'm starting my job.
[73:46.39]There's a recorder under here.
[73:48.82]I pick it up and I press play.
[73:50.66]Hello again, David.
[73:52.80]This is Jigsaw.
[73:53.40]Fuck.
[73:53.94]Just throw it out the window.
[73:57.70]I don't know what it is, but I don't want to know.
[74:04.50]I would get away from this.
[74:06.64]I would go to the doctor immediately.
[74:08.14]I would get every scan.
[74:15.16]uh yeah David everything looks clean everything yeah yeah yeah there was a small little thing in uh behind your uh behind the back of your right side of your neck is it a key no no no no just a little bit a little fatty nodule we you know not a big deal or anything it's just pretty normal okay but then I would I would be fine what is that in the distance
[74:58.29]I have to.
[75:00.33]It's a UFO.
[75:02.70]It's a UFO.
[75:06.30]I'm going to go find it.
[75:07.18]This is the shittiest part.
[75:11.44]This is the shittiest version of Independence Day I've ever seen.
[75:13.82]How do we stop him?
[75:19.06]We have no power.
[75:20.92]Our weapons are useless.
[75:23.58]Who's that down on the golf cart?
[75:27.02]I'll take care of this.
[75:29.96]Aww.
[75:37.90]I need to look at that.
[75:38.42]I need to see what that is.
[75:45.17]It gets like close enough.
[75:48.81]You alien bastards!
[75:52.81]And just a small little ray just comes out of the front of the UFO and liquidates this.
[75:59.64]There's no explosion or anything.
[76:00.56]There's no... Oh my god, what a big death.
[76:02.16]Nope.
[76:02.94]It just... Vaporized.
[76:04.78]Gone.
[76:05.40]That person's gone.
[76:05.90]I don't even know where my base is.
[76:11.92]Alright, I gotta use this telescope and look.
[76:25.90]Alright.
[76:27.70]Oh, come on.
[76:28.26]Really?
[76:28.56]I can't... Okay.
[76:30.66]Wait, there's a car too.
[76:31.88]Wait, why would I get in that when there's a car?
[76:33.48]There's a Tesla truck.
[76:44.09]It's a cyber truck.
[76:46.63]And there's window breakings.
[76:49.79]This is a joke, right?
[76:50.69]They did this on purpose.
[76:54.23]That's pretty funny.
[76:58.11]What are they loading in here?
[77:04.21]Alright, telescope.
[77:13.78]Monkey eyes.
[77:14.22]Alright, where was that?
[77:22.53]It was like over there somewhere, right?
[77:40.33]Is it up?
[77:44.57]I don't see it.
[77:45.02]What?
[77:47.68]I don't see anything.
[77:50.48]It was just the helicopter.
[77:51.56]It was actually the helicopter.
[77:53.02]Which is really far away.
[77:53.90]Oh, okay.
[77:55.34]Alright, let's take a look.
[77:59.52]Let's check on my frequency.
[78:02.32]How's it doing?
[78:04.16]Alright, we are.
[78:04.72]323.
[78:04.88]We'll go 307.
[78:23.66]Hurry up.
[78:27.04]What am I doing?
[78:28.48]I'm bringing this down to the minimum so we can go from minimum to maximum.
[78:32.95]Use the website.
[78:33.65]I don't know what you mean, website.
[78:37.69]Terminal?
[78:40.76]What website are you talking about?
[78:43.48]Use the website.
[78:50.86]Dude, that thing is scrolling.
[78:53.40]Radio.
[78:54.34]Use the radio.
[79:04.54]ABC lounge.
[79:07.35]Why is this buffering?
[79:08.19]I can't even fucking hear it.
[79:25.35]Extreme DMCA.
[79:26.77]Actual DMCA.
[79:28.65]Wait, is this for real?
[79:32.13]Oh.
[79:35.97]Alright, we're at 316.
[79:41.06]Is this a real radio station?
[79:44.84]Wait, can you get DMCA'd for a radio station?
[79:51.45]You can.
[79:52.63]Oh, Santa Claus is fucked.
[79:56.74]Every mall Santa just went... Worst noise.
[80:12.02]What?
[80:14.22]What do you mean worst sound?
[80:19.14]What?
[80:23.66]Oh, I just went gulp with a cat puke sound.
[80:26.86]That's not a big deal.
[80:27.76]Do you hear yourself?
[80:28.70]No.
[80:33.38]No one understood that joke.
[80:36.44]I'm saying every mall Santa has just the Christmas radio station playing right next to them.
[80:49.81]Is it a bad joke?
[80:52.92]That wasn't very funny?
[80:53.96]Oh, oh well.
[80:57.90]But they're not streaming.
[81:00.92]Oh, yeah, right.
[81:01.98]It's not illegal to listen to music.
[81:04.56]Or will it be eventually?
[81:06.70]There's the deep part of that joke you guys missed.
[81:09.00]It went right over your head.
[81:19.08]You have to have a fucking Blizzard authenticator stick.
[81:22.50]to stick into your radio to prove that you can actually listen to that song.
[81:27.49]Just wait, just wait.
[81:28.95]And then at that point, BTC will be $100,000 and who gives a shit?
[81:32.75]I'll be a millionaire.
[81:44.06]Well, I'll have one.
[81:45.56]And then I'll probably sell it when it crashes in like a week.
[81:49.26]I don't know.
[81:49.68]I'm not a financial advisor.
[81:50.74]Don't take any advice from me.
[81:51.64]I have no idea what's going on.
[81:52.80]It's fucking, it's insanity.
[81:54.22]Okay.
[82:05.86]Okay.
[82:10.39]I have no signal.
[82:12.25]I have no signal again.
[82:14.21]Well, can I get one that's not over 300?
[82:16.03]Is it?
[82:16.23]Wait, did I go?
[82:17.05]Is this time asleep?
[82:21.96]You idiot.
[82:23.40]Coordinates.
[82:24.10]Signal simulator on GitHub.
[82:28.14]You guys are linking me a GitHub.
[82:31.04]I need to go to a GitHub website to play this game.
[82:35.75]Really?
[82:36.17]Really?
[82:40.57]You want me to cheat?
[82:42.75]Nope.
[82:43.85]I'm going to find one before the stream turns off.
[82:45.35]I swear to God.
[82:46.53]I need to find one.
[82:56.18]And the second that I find one and it goes... Wait, I have money.
[83:04.62]I have 20 bucks.
[83:07.26]Okay, how about...
[83:11.00]recharge recharge rate upgrade that doesn't seem like very much but on the solar panels 20 big ones that's right I'll probably do this how much is it 30 bucks I don't have it's all these are 30. so let me get this straight I'm not getting paid to work right now is that what I'm understanding
[83:44.29]How come I'm not getting paid?
[83:45.45]You only get paid if you do your job.
[83:50.34]How have I not been doing my job?
[83:51.68]I've been desperately trying to find these needle-in-a-haystack pinpoint coordinates and I almost got one.
[84:01.96]You get paid when you find the aliens.
[84:10.79]Where's the alien?
[84:18.61]Just because I haven't found the alien yet doesn't mean I don't get paid for the work I'm doing to try to find the alien?
[84:23.23]Alright, let's get a signal.
[84:34.46]I've slept.
[84:40.17]Where are the results?
[84:43.15]I don't know I want photos Jerma photos of aliens what is this jade is Spider-Man guy this is what he goes into when he realizes that Spider-Man's just a fucking teenager and it's not this big conspiracy or anything get those pictures of those aliens parker
[85:10.98]I didn't invest $200 billion in this university to not see results.
[85:20.37]And they better be big and they better be green.
[85:37.30]I want corn in Spider-Man.
[85:47.29]Wait, why does he call Peter?
[85:48.15]Wait, at this point he knows, right?
[85:51.63]Why is he talking to Spider-Man?
[85:57.29]Peter Parker just goes in without the mask on into the Daily Bugle.
[86:00.32]Now I spent two decades following you around, God damn it, Parker.
[86:07.78]Okay, here we go.
[86:27.56]Oh, this.
[86:41.46]What do we got?
[86:43.70]Why are they all in the hundreds?
[86:47.90]A hundred and... Ugh.
[86:50.80]Come on.
[86:51.66]Alright, 148.
[86:52.56]Let's just get the process going right now.
[86:53.86]148, go.
[86:55.52]Where are three fucking hundred, dude?
[86:57.36]I have to go down to like 180.
[87:08.41]This is going to take all night.
[87:10.83]Track is available.
[87:13.07]Alright, so if I press this button, what happens?
[87:22.50]Just do both at the same time.
[87:26.70]Wait, why is it doing that?
[87:28.02]How can we do that?
[87:30.09]It's tracking the coordinate right now.
[87:38.31]Oh.
[87:40.43]Turn up detection?
[87:43.43]Your antenna is not at max efficiency.
[87:49.39]Efficiency is at five.
[88:03.40]Aliens don't omegalo exist, dumbass.
[88:07.56]Alright, but why is my system efficiency so low?
[88:13.19]Do I have to, like, recharge the battery or something?
[88:15.07]How do I recharge a university research facility's battery?
[88:30.49]Go to the solar panels and clean them?
[88:32.57]Oh, come on.
[88:34.23]You actually aren't... That's actually for real.
[88:37.27]You really mean that?
[88:38.13]That's really what I have to do.
[88:40.49]I have to go clean the solar panels.
[88:44.02]Where are the solar panels?
[88:49.08]They're covered in snow.
[88:51.30]Oh, please.
[88:58.14]But where are they?
[89:04.92]How do I get up?
[89:06.20]Where are these solar panels?
[89:07.06]They're on the left?
[89:15.39]Like, down there?
[89:16.91]How do I get up?
[89:22.53]Oh, for the love of God.
[89:33.78]Where's my car?
[89:42.16]No, my other car.
[89:49.71]What was that?
[89:53.72]That was me, okay.
[90:09.93]Okay, let's go.
[90:12.33]Cybertruck.
[90:13.25]Oh, my God.
[90:13.95]Cybertruck.
[90:14.71]Pog.
[90:16.37]Are you serious?
[90:19.95]Get in your Cybertruck and drink your Heal.
[90:25.87]I like Heal.
[90:26.69]I don't care if you hate me.
[90:29.05]How do I clean this?
[90:35.56]This is not solar panels.
[90:36.64]This is like a grain mill.
[90:40.48]Is that a solar panel?
[90:41.52]Oh, there we go.
[91:01.01]Alright.
[91:01.47]Solar panels.
[91:01.95]Let's go.
[91:02.29]Clean them off.
[91:04.81]The splash light makes things worse.
[91:08.94]Open and close the door.
[91:11.06]Start the cleaning system.
[91:17.51]The cleaning?
[91:19.69]Efficiency 0.9%.
[91:20.29]What happens if that goes to zero?
[91:27.48]Don't press it.
[91:28.02]What?
[91:31.92]What do you mean?
[91:32.54]It's nighttime.
[91:39.71]I can't clean at night?
[91:46.60]Solar panels do not work at night.
[91:49.78]But they still take in the electricity.
[91:53.58]They take in electricity.
[91:54.50]I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-
[92:10.79]Oh shit, a huge raid just came in.
[92:12.97]Who just raided?
[92:13.53]Who just raided?
[92:15.37]Who just raided?
[92:17.57]It's ConnorEatsPants.
[92:19.57]With like 5 fucking thousand people.
[92:22.77]Welcome everybody.
[92:23.41]What's up?
[92:24.89]How's everybody doing?
[92:27.74]Welcome to the stream.
[92:30.84]My name's Jerma985.
[92:32.80]What's your name?
[92:35.38]Just write like your handle in the chat.
[92:37.18]Don't write your name.
[92:38.88]Make one up.
[92:41.22]I have to sing the raid song.
[92:42.42]No, we don't do raid songs anymore.
[92:44.00]That's how you delete a thousand people in one second.
[92:46.29]Can I just stand here until morning?
[92:53.55]Thanks for the raid.
[92:54.05]Welcome, guys.
[92:55.17]Hope you had a good stream, whatever you were doing.
[92:59.19]I'm trying to figure out how to contact aliens.
[93:01.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[93:02.29]Here we go.
[93:04.92]Would this work?
[93:10.03]You know that in an M. Night Shyamalan movie, this would work at some point.
[93:14.98]This would be a huge thing.
[93:16.14]Alright, let me check.
[93:31.17]Oh, god damn it.
[93:31.89]I have to go to sleep.
[93:33.37]What the fuck?
[93:34.27]I don't want...
[93:40.69]3,000 people left because you didn't sing the raid song.
[93:43.90]I'm not singing any raid songs.
[93:45.26]Not anymore.
[93:45.96]Not since it got nominated.
[93:47.28]There's a UFO right there.
[93:48.06]There's a UFO right there.
[93:50.84]There's a UFO right there.
[93:54.18]That's not a helicopter.
[93:55.00]I saw the circular angle on it.
[93:57.20]That is a UFO.
[93:59.36]Remember where that is.
[94:02.63]Where's my house?
[94:03.27]Where's my base?
[94:05.31]It's back this way.
[94:14.58]Over there.
[94:15.40]I see it.
[94:15.74]I see it.
[94:16.06]I see it.
[94:16.32]I see it.
[94:16.58]I see it.
[94:16.80]What's this?
[94:18.44]I don't know what I just did.
[94:21.48]Turn that off?
[94:21.90]Should I turn this off?
[94:23.52]Alright.
[94:36.55]Where was the... Where was the UFO?
[94:37.89]It was right there somewhere.
[94:44.40]It's gone.
[94:45.02]What the fuck?
[94:48.98]Hold on.
[94:49.28]Hold on.
[94:49.54]Hold on.
[94:49.80]I'm gonna see.
[94:50.26]I'm gonna see.
[94:55.22]There it is.
[94:55.54]There it is.
[94:59.16]Where'd it go?
[95:00.84]Where'd it go?
[95:01.42]Gone.
[95:14.50]Whatever.
[95:14.76]Alright.
[95:15.46]Am I coordinates ready?
[95:17.38]I need to sleep so I can go clean the stupid solar panels.
[95:24.93]You have a dirty monitor.
[95:26.69]I kind of do.
[95:27.11]You don't need to rest right now.
[95:28.29]What am I supposed to do?
[95:34.18]Okay.
[95:35.34]We are at two... Why is it still spinning?
[95:41.32]Oh, I had track coordinates on.
[95:51.06]So this thing's just been... I've just been using energy.
[96:00.84]No wonder I can't, like, even turn the TV on in my house.
[96:06.36]I used it all up just spinning this thing in a circle.
[96:11.68]You need at least 50% efficiency to do anything.
[96:13.92]Oh, God.
[96:14.52]I can't sleep either.
[96:24.91]Lock the doors.
[96:26.11]Change difficulty to the azimuth and elevation trackers update in real time.
[96:29.52]Yeah.
[96:52.51]You didn't even give me...
[97:00.52]Signal-sign detection modes update only when the antenna finishes rotating.
[97:04.04]Oh fuck that.
[97:05.15]That's not even how it works in the real world.
[97:09.11]This is not even how this works in real life.
[97:13.89]If you tune something, what, you have to wait until you get to the end?
[97:19.17]When you're sitting at your car radio and you use the tuner, you don't have a silent fucking radio until you reach like 91.2.
[97:25.05]That's not how it works.
[97:28.29]You hear a...
[97:31.26]You hear the frequency.
[97:31.94]You hear the noise.
[97:32.60]You get to hear them in real time.
[97:33.90]That's how it works.
[97:34.50]These things are worth like 500 billion dollars.
[97:45.61]You're right.
[97:45.97]Aliens will be found tomorrow.
[97:47.17]Alright, here we go.
[97:54.70]Let's do it.
[97:55.62]I'm ready.
[97:58.33]Everything's at max efficiency.
[98:00.01]Configuring the ISA PNP file system up.
[98:04.71]Did that just say imminent shutdown?
[98:06.19]Alright, here we go.
[98:07.22]Scanner.
[98:07.90]I'm ready.
[98:08.20]Okay.
[98:22.79]I want this shit in real time.
[98:24.39]The way that it is.
[98:28.69]Analyze that planet, please.
[98:41.36]Name this planet.
[98:43.26]Um... Uh... Balthazar.
[98:55.28]Balthazar-122.
[99:09.43]Planets are so far away and you want to see them instantly.
[99:13.46]I'm not actually in a research facility.
[99:17.52]This is pretend.
[99:23.12]Okay.
[99:23.64]Now I got that.
[99:24.78]It's time to... Let's find that frequency.
[99:27.06]Auto scan, please.
[99:28.59]Can't.
[99:28.99]It's alright.
[99:44.76]What is the exact speed of light?
[99:47.28]Um, isn't it like 10,000 miles per hour?
[99:50.74]It's an easy number to say.
[99:51.58]I'm just gonna say that.
[100:04.07]Got it.
[100:05.79]Got it.
[100:08.31]Got it.
[100:09.84]No.
[100:11.58]Give it back.
[100:13.76]Got it.
[100:16.06]That it?
[100:18.94]That it?
[100:20.30]Give it back.
[100:22.24]Use auto?
[100:22.88]I can't.
[100:24.40]Doesn't do anything.
[100:30.09]What's the speed of light?
[100:40.33]I would walk 10,000 miles and I would walk 10,000 more just to be the man who would walk a thousand miles to fall down.
[100:53.09]We talked about this, right?
[100:55.87]You'd walk like five miles, get tired, and then just be like, you know what?
[100:58.41]I'm just going to drive there.
[101:01.12]It's too much.
[101:01.54]There we go.
[101:02.28]Got it.
[101:09.70]Like, oh, I would walk a thousand miles.
[101:13.33]Nope.
[101:14.33]I would not.
[101:16.17]I would not.
[101:18.79]I would walk a few and then I would, uh, here's what I would do.
[101:22.99]I would walk for like 10 minutes and realize what I was doing was really stupid.
[101:30.13]But to put forth the illusion that I did so, I would just get the clothes I was wearing.
[101:34.56]I would, like, roll them into the dirt a little bit.
[101:37.12]I would take a little bit of, like, dirt and, like, rub it in my hands.
[101:39.40]Like, rub it on my face.
[101:40.80]Like, cartoon character style.
[101:43.17]Like, I got, like, attacked by it.
[101:45.35]Like, I got shot with, like, a cartoon shotgun.
[101:47.13]You know what I mean?
[101:48.69]Mess up my hair, shitload.
[101:50.55]This is a Family Guy joke?
[101:51.51]What the fuck?
[101:52.17]Are you kidding me?
[101:53.05]I can't even tell a joke anymore, and it's, like, already a Family Guy routine?
[101:56.58]They de- I've-
[102:04.47]Whatever.
[102:07.47]What do we got for a signal?
[102:09.11]Really?

[103:38.91]No, I'm going to get this set.

[103:48.19]You'll be begging for this to come back when I play Golf Simulator 2.
[103:57.06]You'll be begging for this to come back.
[104:09.17]Alright, no real-time data yet.
[104:10.83]We're getting closer.
[104:18.09]Alright, so we're going to go from 140.
[104:20.09]We're going to go to 188 and then 42.
[104:20.93]188 to 42.
[104:21.03]Looking at that elevation right now.
[104:40.61]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[107:17.27]18.2.
[107:17.37]I hear some new noise.
[107:20.51]18.4.
[107:20.53]Oh, boy.
[107:20.67]It got quiet.
[107:20.93]18.5.
[107:20.95]18.4.
[107:21.77]We got it.
[107:52.42]18.45 18.47 18.45 18.44 18.43 Got it.
[107:52.76]What's that?
[108:32.22]Waiting for data to be downloaded.
[108:34.58]Download it.
[108:45.58]Play the video.
[108:47.56]What happened?
[108:54.87]Waiting for- wait.
[108:56.91]Oh my goodness.
[108:59.77]What is this shit?
[109:02.23]coordinates and then upgrades modules energy solar panels energy distribution calibration how do I download the data oh it's downloading it's right now it's downloading
[109:34.49]This is one gigabyte of alien Zorn.
[109:37.05]Go to the power.
[109:42.51]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[109:44.07]Quick, I gotta download quick.
[109:48.04]I need more server.
[109:51.54]Put more download power.
[109:52.90]There we go.
[109:56.54]I increased my fucking speeds a little bit.
[110:08.22]Alright, I need to shut this off.
[110:09.18]This is annoying.
[110:20.52]50% incoming.
[110:22.35]This is Zetidated Wham.
[110:28.65]Planet type.
[110:29.27]This is called Trojan Planet.
[110:32.33]And it's called Fast Radio Burst.
[110:44.53]If 60%.
[110:44.73]Drink some of that coffee right now.
[110:59.50]66%.
[111:02.66]Fast radio burst.
[111:08.05]It's a bursting Trojan.
[111:19.44]Alien Zorn.
[111:29.95]I guess this is pretty fast.
[111:31.77]What internet provider is this?
[111:33.05]5 megs a second.
[111:36.55]Downloading from 500 billion light years away.
[111:40.37]That's really good.
[111:44.00]The ping on this download is probably like 600 million.
[111:49.61]In fact, I probably already downloaded this like 30 years in the future, right?
[111:55.99]Or like 20 years ago by now, right?
[111:58.04]Time works weirdly when you're going through like light speed and stuff.
[112:01.52]What would happen, right?
[112:07.06]I downloaded this now and I started to download like 10 million years in the future, right?
[112:12.35]How does that work?
[112:16.56]Because I activate the download now, it goes to do that, to pull it, like 50 million light years away.
[112:32.94]Well, it would take like, oh no, it would take a million years for me to get it, right?
[112:41.98]Radio is light, dumbass.
[112:45.67]Okay, professor.
[112:49.57]Wait, what do you mean radio?
[112:52.29]That's not even accurate.
[112:55.46]Radio.
[112:57.70]Okay, decoding complete.
[112:59.04]I got the message.
[113:00.48]Decoded data is... Oh, great.
[113:10.14]All this bullshit to have picked up like the end of a barcode on a single banana.
[113:18.89]Fantastic.
[113:22.55]How much does this facility cost?
[113:29.39]How do I bring this up to my supervisor, right?
[113:33.89]I bring him, look at this code.
[113:34.99]We got a secret code.
[113:37.02]Oh, we got to put it through all of our machines.
[113:38.48]Let's see what that is.
[113:41.06]And they put it into the machine.
[113:42.64]And it's like one Chiquita banana.
[113:45.28]40 cents.
[113:50.28]Do I get fired immediately?
[113:58.94]What do I do with this now?
[114:00.73]Just get this shit out of me.
[114:06.23]What do I do with this?
[114:06.89]I have this decoded data.
[114:10.49]What do I do with the decoded data?
[114:11.77]Oh shit.
[114:19.58]Alright, play it.
[114:24.59]Okay.
[114:49.86]You can get this exact same audio holding a microphone up to the wall if you have a neighbor that shares a wall while they're currently watching Monday Night Football.
[115:05.83]Oh.
[115:09.09]I don't think we found anything very spectacular.
[115:16.41]Wait, that's not...
[115:19.08]That's just the sounds that's going on in the room.
[115:23.58]Wait, what?
[115:24.02]Hold on.
[115:27.72]The alien is watching Monday Night Football.
[115:38.77]Oh, shit.
[115:39.31]Alright.
[115:40.03]Cool.
[115:40.35]So, did I get any money?
[115:41.33]I got $240! $240!
[115:47.76]$240 for that?
[115:49.66]Upgrade the rotation, please.
[115:54.64]And, oh, what am I supposed to do?
[115:55.78]Cooling.
[115:56.71]No, more char- more charging.
[115:58.05]What else should I do?
[116:01.85]Efficiency.
[116:03.49]Lower the energy consumption.
[116:04.71]Yup.
[116:05.65]Twice.
[116:11.06]Tracking.
[116:11.50]Reduce the consumption of electronics.
[116:13.02]Yup.
[116:17.33]Twice.
[116:19.59]Alright, we're good.
[116:20.11]Fly.
[116:27.16]I did it.
[116:28.30]I got my first alien.
[116:32.48]I got my first alien.
[116:40.19]I thought that was a gas can.
[116:44.65]How do I not need to sleep?
[116:45.63]I haven't slept in like three days.
[116:55.90]Check the bathroom Why does everybody keep saying this?
[117:09.97]Does an alien climb out of the bathtub eventually?
[117:11.75]I'm sure it does That's a weird place for toilet paper
[117:28.78]I did that one time.
[117:29.56]I don't know what happened.
[117:30.14]I got stuck in a fucking light.
[117:31.44]I got like jumped.
[117:32.00]I got jumped into a light speed wormhole there.
[117:42.08]Didn't wash hands.
[117:43.15]I didn't do anything.
[117:47.67]No, I didn't.
[117:48.35]No, I didn't wash my hands because I sat on the top of the ceramic part of the toilet and then flushed it.
[117:53.77]I didn't touch it.
[117:54.39]I didn't like touch.
[117:55.05]I didn't touch anything.
[117:56.39]I didn't do anything.
[118:09.55]planet was that?
[118:10.17]Okay.

[118:28.26]I can't wait.
[118:33.44]Scanner.
[118:36.36]You know, I'm thinking up here there'll be some aliens up this way.
[118:40.10]I'm really feeling top right.
[118:50.22]Veto this.
[118:51.90]Uh...

[119:32.86]I just solved the case of a secret alien planet.
[119:36.10]Yes, I did.
[119:36.64]I just got $200.
[119:41.00]I just cracked the case of an alien planet.
[119:43.16]In two hours?
[119:44.34]It takes scientists like 30 years to do this shit.
[119:52.47]Imagine being upset that the scientist that you just hired in two hours found an alien planet.
[119:59.37]I really wanted you to do that in like 20 minutes.
[120:09.04]Come on, where is it?
[120:11.52]This is a super high frequency.
[120:14.80]Scientists haven't found aliens yet.
[120:17.22]Okay, if you believe that then I don't know what to tell you.
[120:21.02]They've been in communication with aliens for like the last fucking 400 years.
[120:23.32]500 years.
[120:35.29]Yeah.
[120:35.51]You guys didn't see it.
[120:37.73]John Alien signed the Declaration of Independence, but they fucking whited it out.
[120:41.62]They didn't want people to know.
[120:42.90]He had a big powdered wig on.
[120:52.07]They photoshopped him out of all the photos by this point.
[121:05.24]Yeah, John Quincy Alien.
[121:11.74]They just... What do you want me to tell you?
[121:22.31]Wrong way?
[121:23.01]What?

[121:37.10]Let's give it a try.
[121:39.02]Go!
[121:57.53]Are you still playing this?
[121:58.57]Oh, there it is.
[121:59.47]The two hour mark.
[122:00.63]Somebody in pre-stream's chat said, we're gonna pick this in pre-stream and in two hours exactly we're gonna start seeing why is he still playing this.
[122:08.89]Right on the dot.
[122:09.83]They were right.
[122:10.87]In two hours exactly.
[122:12.53]Here it comes.
[122:17.34]Oh, I gotta hold on.
[122:18.00]Power.
[122:21.56]Oh, it's already there.
[122:25.11]Are you still playing this?
[122:28.94]What are we looking for?
[122:30.08]44.
[122:30.30]Alright, let's just keep an eye on it.
[122:32.36]Stop being mean to this game.
[122:37.56]I love it.
[122:37.90]I'm not being... I'm having fun.
[122:43.14]When did I say I didn't like this game?
[122:44.64]I just said that I needed a better tutorial.
[122:48.68]And what's with the paragraph?
[122:51.00]Wait, the only complaint I've had so far, guys, is the extreme paragraph space.
[122:55.48]That's it.
[122:57.58]Oh, and I hate the knobs or something, right?
[122:59.08]Whatever, that's not a big deal.
[123:12.90]Clean the panels.
[123:13.62]What are we at?
[123:14.60]61%?
[123:14.64]I'll do that today.
[123:16.56]After I find this, I'm going to scan it and we're going to watch the video.
[123:19.96]Oh shit, look at this.
[123:20.60]I just got back from pooping for an hour.
[123:30.12]Is he still playing the science homework video game?
[123:33.94]I would probably make an appointment with like a... Are you going to Beth for an hour?
[123:41.08]Wait, hold on.
[123:41.56]It's important.
[123:41.98]Was your computer in there?
[123:42.88]Cause then that's fine.
[123:53.60]Drink some water.
[123:54.34]Yeah.
[123:56.34]But if you, what it was a switch that counts too.
[123:58.75]That's fine.
[124:03.91]Video is of the poop slowly.
[124:19.03]I can't look at it.
[124:19.91]You fucking weirdo.
[124:21.08]Alright, we're getting there.
[124:26.86]Keep an eye.
[124:28.85]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[124:30.53]40!

[125:07.87]Stop!
[125:08.09]Stop!
[125:12.23]Seventy-three.
[125:14.03]Almost there.
[125:14.85]Nice job, dude.
[125:18.51]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[125:20.45]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[125:23.17]Alright, now we just gotta do elevation.
[125:24.63]Where are we at now?
[125:27.11]53.
[125:28.03]Elevation is 58 to 89.
[125:31.34]Okay.
[125:32.86]So let's go.
[125:33.44]Let's go for it.
[125:37.24]See if we can find something.
[125:40.20]Stop deluding yourself.
[125:40.94]This game sucks.
[125:41.56]Everyone knows it.
[125:42.08]It's a meme game where all you do is... I know, that person's upset about this.
[125:58.79]Ban that guy.
[125:59.45]No, what, ban him for having an opinion?
[126:02.71]He just, he doesn't like this game.
[126:04.15]Oh, what, am I going to say, how dare you not like something that I don't like?
[126:08.91]Wait, I mean, I do, I, I like this, but you know what I'm saying.
[126:12.64]Do I agree with this person?
[126:15.56]I think I, like, agree with that guy.
[126:17.54]Um, but still, relax.
[126:29.95]We already banned him?
[126:32.89]No, I'm kidding.
[126:33.83]I'm just kidding.
[126:34.73]I like this game.
[126:35.43]It's fun.
[126:37.27]It's fun just to sit and look at a number go up.
[126:38.77]It's not a game.
[126:43.94]It's a simulator.
[126:45.38]It's a video game.
[126:48.16]It's a video game.
[126:55.46]Refund.
[126:55.88]I'm not... Why would I refund it?
[126:57.18]I'm enjoying myself.
[126:59.94]Alright, can we please pay attention to this?
[127:04.22]65... 66... 67... I'm so glad I turned on the easy mode.
[127:09.14]This would have been hell.
[127:09.82]69... 70... Really?
[127:11.22]Really?
[127:12.24]Really?
[127:32.97]Really?
[127:36.01]Weird, OK, even more than 80.
[127:41.03]What?
[127:44.21]Hold on a second, I'm at 83 right now.
[127:47.86]Is it?
[127:50.42]Did I miss it?
[127:53.80]Did I miss it?
[127:57.20]Was it back down like 60?
[127:58.36]Oh, come on, really?
[128:06.94]No, it was not.
[128:13.40]Go to 90?
[128:14.28]But no, max is 89.
[128:26.69]I like the part when the number was 60.1.
[128:30.69]Oh, cool, man.
[128:32.49]It was pretty cool.
[128:34.13]It was cool when it was that number for like a second or so.
[128:36.68]I don't know.
[128:40.44]Oh, yeah.
[128:42.58]87.
[128:44.74]Got it.
[128:47.62]I can't believe people didn't like that we got one thing.
[128:49.47]I thought that was going to be a huge hit.
[128:51.39]88, 89.
[129:00.42]There it is.
[129:02.14]We got it?
[129:03.98]Waiting for binary data.
[129:05.18]Let's go.
[129:05.56]Play the video.
[129:09.96]There's no video?
[129:24.65]Oh, shit.
[129:24.99]Okay, hold on.
[129:27.92]While this downloads, I gotta go clean the, uh, the stuff.
[129:35.93]Alright, downloading.
[129:37.71]Clean the solar panels.
[129:38.43]I'll be right back.
[129:57.53]Stop beating around the bush.
[129:58.47]This game sucks.
[129:59.17]Give us Catboy.
[130:00.93]You'll get Catboy when you get it.
[130:05.22]You'll get Catboy when you get Catboy.
[130:08.68]Not a second sooner.
[130:13.38]Okay, how we doing?
[130:14.76]60% efficiency.
[130:15.94]Clean.
[130:21.44]Press F to start the cleaning system.
[130:22.99]Did I?
[130:23.29]Large efficiency.
[130:27.89]100%.
[130:27.93]F, F, F, F. Why is everybody saying F?
[130:37.49]Did that work?
[130:41.57]It's going back up?
[130:43.33]Alright, we're good.
[130:54.38]That's because I said F. Oh.
[130:57.90]Well, I'm forever messed up just because of all the internet problems I had over the last three or four years.
[131:03.18]It's...
[131:04.83]Being on fiber now.
[131:06.37]Every time I see the word F, I just go, wait, my internet must be down.
[131:09.13]Internet's down.
[131:21.16]Cool looking, like, dog.
[131:25.24]F is for fiber, dipshit.
[131:30.73]Stop it.
[131:32.35]Alright, how are we doing on the download?
[131:37.74]39?
[131:37.82]That's it?
[131:38.28]Come on.
[131:42.35]This like brings me back to when I used to go back on a 56k modem.
[131:47.81]I would download like stone cold stunning people from like wrestling websites.
[131:55.70]And a pixelated 160p video of a four second clip of stone cold stunning Ken Shamrock.
[132:05.27]I had a whole folder of stuns and rock bottoms and people's elbows and shit.
[132:11.45]Took like four hours to download them at a time.
[132:26.88]Watch a stunner compilation.
[132:28.98]You just told me how old you are.
[132:33.72]There was no such thing as a stunner compilation.
[132:36.04]You guys have it so good.
[132:38.12]You had to individually download Stone Cold Stuns Undertaker.
[132:43.66]It was eight seconds long and it took four hours to download.
[132:47.00]You didn't get to watch it.
[132:49.08]You didn't get to preview it.
[132:51.38]It was a file you had to download onto your computer and then open it in Windows and no, open it in QuickTime.
[133:02.95]You kids and your compilation videos, yeah.
[133:13.40]It meant do it now.
[133:19.02]Wait, like you mean on stream.
[133:20.40]Okay, well, sorry.
[133:21.46]I got a little upset that you just attacked me.
[133:26.38]Well, that's just like we said.
[133:28.58]We asked Grandpa how he was doing.
[133:31.40]Grandpa, how are you?
[133:33.72]We used to have to download four hours to get a Stone Cold stunner.
[133:40.50]And it sucked.
[133:43.62]And there was no such thing as Amazon.
[133:47.02]If you wanted a package, you had to send it with your own bare hands.
[133:51.59]You had to shot put it as far as you could into the fucking ocean.
[133:55.79]And hope one of the dolphins picked it up and brought it to your destination.
[134:03.23]Sorry.
[134:03.63]Yeah, that did happen.
[134:04.99]I just got charcoal all over my hands.
[134:07.45]I just touched the bottom of my chair.
[134:08.79]What the hell happened?
[134:12.08]There's tar on my hands because I touched the bottom of my seat.
[134:18.02]Underneath where the metal part is, I just grabbed it and was touching it and gripping it.
[134:21.99]I don't know why.
[134:22.55]I just was.
[134:23.63]Leave me alone.
[134:24.19]I had to wash my hands.
[134:25.11]I'll be back.
[138:39.66]Hi there.
[138:43.44]Yeah, I had some water.
[138:44.10]I went to the bathroom.
[138:45.20]Let's keep going.
[138:48.32]Throwback Jerma with Chad Wario hair.
[138:53.84]What?
[138:56.54]Let me throwback.
[138:58.62]That was like two and a half years ago.
[139:01.60]Oh, that's what I look like now.
[139:04.32]Have I aged that much in three years?
[139:07.72]Maybe it is a throwback.
[139:11.26]Okay, let's go.
[139:16.38]Download is at 87%.
[139:19.63]Career over.
[139:20.65]Hey.
[139:23.91]Still here.
[139:24.29]I had really... I got more credits added?
[139:32.22]Not enough data.
[139:35.78]What?
[139:39.23]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[139:50.00]Hey!
[139:52.80]What happened?
[140:02.03]What?
[140:02.31]What happened?
[140:02.75]87? 87?
[140:08.63]I don't understand what's going on.
[140:11.45]88?
[140:19.45]What happened?
[140:22.52]You shit your pants.
[140:25.12]Here we go.
[140:28.56]88, 89.
[140:28.80]Why did this move?
[140:34.52]Alright.
[140:35.24]Download that shit.
[140:41.04]Hey, Jimbius, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[140:43.40]Shit your pants.
[140:43.88]What are you doing?
[140:45.14]Shit your fucking pants now.
[140:46.42]Shit your pants.
[140:47.14]What are you doing?
[140:47.70]Why are you guys doing this?
[140:48.50]Shit you.
[140:55.85]Fuck you.
[140:56.21]Shit your pants.
[141:02.05]Shit your pants.
[141:03.65]I'm not gonna do that.
[141:04.51]You guys got on this somehow.
[141:13.72]Clear the debt for shitting your pants.
[141:20.48]Clear the chat and clear the account.
[141:23.74]Because that's what would happen.
[141:25.94]Permanently.
[141:28.50]So, no.
[141:35.92]This is the worst chat I've ever seen.
[141:37.46]I don't believe that.
[141:44.43]Here we go.
[141:47.26]Translating to binary.
[141:50.84]One.
[141:51.90]Zero.
[141:53.13]Let's see.
[141:55.21]I got it perfect so far.
[142:31.14]I'm done.
[142:36.72]I'm gonna mute you.
[142:37.50]Why would I finish that?
[142:41.91]That would be annoying.
[142:43.81]It was annoying like fucking four zero ones ago.
[142:48.53]Yeah, but who cares?
[142:53.17]Yes, that happened.
[142:54.69]Like, five years ago.
[142:58.41]He told that story.
[142:59.11]That's a real story.
[142:59.94]He shit his pants.
[143:02.18]I think he was streaming too.
[143:03.68]That was on his stream.
[143:04.52]What do you mean, what?
[143:09.68]Yeah, Star shit his pants.
[143:12.50]On stream.
[143:13.22]And he just didn't get up.
[143:15.19]He's told this story like three or four times.
[143:23.96]You guys don't remember?
[143:24.74]Oh, a lot of you guys are new, right.
[143:28.96]Yeah, he didn't want to lose the match.
[143:32.76]If you think about that out of context.
[143:35.08]Well, in context too, that's not good either, is it?
[143:38.32]It's not good in any context.
[143:40.85]Alright, I got that.
[143:41.37]Wait.
[143:42.41]Module schematics downloaded.
[143:51.03]Oh, shit.
[143:53.62]Let's listen!
[144:02.18]Amazing Link.
[144:11.47]Oh yeah, hey, ping, ping.
[144:14.79]Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, shit your pants, fuck you.
[144:17.61]I'm going to make their day better on purpose.
[144:20.66]Yeah, I'm gonna shit my pants on purpose to make their day better.
[144:25.69]I'm gonna make their day better on purpose.
[144:27.10]Like, I'm gonna shit my pants on purpose to make their day better.
[144:37.04]I've seen this.
[144:43.93]He doesn't get it.
[144:44.83]I do get it.
[144:45.61]Yes, I do.
[144:46.31]Okay, somebody explain to me why.
[144:52.34]I can't
[144:55.26]I can't get this out of my head.
[144:58.46]The Smash Brothers Switch theme song with the lyrics on it.
[145:04.20]Just that first, like, sacred hearts are having so much, I can't get it out of my head.
[145:10.49]Just the woman singing part.
[145:14.11]I can't stop.
[145:14.83]It won't leave me alone.
[145:20.50]Just that first, what are the actual lyrics?
[145:25.98]First sentence.
[145:31.34]Colors weave into a spiral of flame.
[145:34.15]What's the next part?
[145:36.85]What does that even mean?
[145:49.48]Nothing about the past.
[145:50.34]Distant past called to a past still unnamed.
[145:54.94]What?
[145:58.84]Colors weave until a spiral of flame Distant hearts called to a past still unnamed Colors weave until a spire of flame Distant Sparks called to a past still unnamed Bear this torch against the cold of the night Search your soul and reawaken the undying light I don't know what any of that means
[146:32.02]Let's go.
[146:39.13]You've sung this song like eight times.
[146:41.23]Do you think I don't... I'm aware of that.
[146:43.53]That doesn't mean I have to keep having it in my head.
[146:46.65]Scanner, please.
[146:55.73]That's your...
[146:59.91]Every event has led up to this point in your life.
[147:02.05]Are you happy?
[147:02.57]Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.
[147:06.35]I'm good.
[147:07.51]I'm alright.
[147:17.54]I have schematics.
[147:18.34]Check the module.
[147:19.26]I will after I scan.
[147:22.49]Sacred flame to a past still unnamed.
[147:26.26]Distant voice through the song of this I don't know I've already lost it you just gave it to me And I don't even know what the lyrics are again.
[147:34.53]It could be anything it could be just a jumble of words Sung to that tune oh I got it Alright modules
[147:52.90]Modules can be upgrading by downloading module schematics from a signal or analyzing, right?
[147:58.20]When a module schematic is downloaded, it will upgrade a random module.
[148:03.86]Okay.
[148:07.25]Well, what did I get?
[148:08.09]Did I... How did I... Slow mode Andy.
[148:20.57]Oh, stop.
[148:22.71]Oh, no, no.
[148:22.99]You're talking about... Okay, I thought you were talking about me.
[148:25.66]Yeah, we have... There's 13,000 people here.
[148:27.24]You don't think there's going to be a slow mode on for like a few minutes?
[148:30.24]A second or two?
[148:30.80]Alright, let's get that.
[148:41.36]Frequency.
[148:48.62]Got it locked in.
[148:56.05]It's your birthday today.
[148:57.45]Baldi, Baldi, happy birthday to you.
[149:00.17]I hope you have a good birthday today.
[149:02.31]That's Baldi in the chat.
[149:03.67]263 18.
[149:08.69]It's a far away one.
[149:15.32]263 18.
[149:15.44]Gonna lose this signal.
[149:17.56]Guarantee it.
[149:22.64]Guarantee I lose this one.
[149:26.63]That's power doing.
[149:31.89]65% efficiency.
[149:32.58]It's my birthday today.
[149:43.70]Put the music slider up so you can hear the decoded message.
[149:53.13]Thanks for the birthday present.
[150:04.06]I don't hear anything.
[150:12.48]Ooh.
[150:12.66]Alright, I'm going to sing happy birthday to you, but I'm going to replace a word in there with binary.
[150:23.59]Happy 1-0-1-1-0-1-0 to you.
[150:28.50]Happy one zero one zero one one zero zero to you Happy one zero one one zero zero one zero Dear Baldi Happy but one zero zero one zero one zero A to you Rude.
[150:50.09]I was calling somebody Baldi.
[150:52.15]That'd be so fucking evil.
[150:55.05]That'd be so mean.
[151:03.24]But that's their username.
[151:10.58]Is that even their username?
[151:11.66]Did I get it wrong?
[151:15.96]It's not their username?
[151:17.10]Yes, it is.
[151:21.26]It's Boldy.
[151:23.66]Not... Oh, shit.
[151:30.53]It was Bradley?
[151:34.67]It was Bold Bradley.
[151:36.44]What did I say?
[151:37.18]Yeah, but I said Bold Baldi.
[151:54.05]I'm sorry.
[151:54.65]That's not your name, but happy birthday to you nonetheless.
[152:06.28]What's their name?
[152:08.02]It's Bold Bradley, not Ball- Bold Baldi?
[152:11.90]Bold Bradley.
[152:12.80]Bold- What's their name?
[152:13.98]What's this person's name?
[152:15.88]Boldy Bradley?
[152:18.60]Boldy Badly.
[152:20.34]Boldy Badly.
[152:22.78]Not Bald Bradley.
[152:24.36]Not Bold Bradley.
[152:25.44]Not Bald Badly.
[152:27.48]Boldly Badly.
[152:28.56]Happy birthday.
[152:36.07]Not bald, boldy.
[152:39.63]Bold... Shit, whatever.
[152:47.41]The chat is going so fast.
[152:49.04]I can't fucking read it sometimes, man.
[152:51.38]Alright, where are we going?
[152:52.24]I got pretty good efficiency right now.
[152:56.60]65.
[152:58.26]And that's the reason why we have slow mode.
[153:02.02]Can you imagine?
[153:02.44]Without slow mode, I would never read anything.
[153:15.58]Go outside?
[153:16.80]Ah, fine.
[153:28.61]Read this, I'll shit my pants.
[153:30.59]I hope you don't do that.
[153:31.87]Don't do that shit.
[153:33.85]It's not like... Who is going to... That's not funny for anyone.
[153:39.03]That's not... That's a bad idea.
[153:41.98]Why would you do something like that?
[153:42.94]That's not a smart idea.
[153:43.80]Don't do that.
[153:54.86]Like, don't take anything I ever say literally.
[153:58.54]And don't you say something literally that you're going to do if I say a certain phrase.
[154:03.83]Don't give yourself secret slime actions to do terrible things if I say them.
[154:11.05]If he says the word Gesundheit, I'm going to shit my pants.
[154:14.65]Don't do that.
[154:16.19]Why are you doing that?
[154:18.25]I don't know.
[154:19.61]Just don't do that.
[154:20.41]Just watch the stream and hang up.
[154:29.62]There it is again.
[154:46.90]That doesn't remember the secret slime action stream.
[154:49.20]Yeah, you don't know.
[154:50.64]I mean like 80% of you weren't here probably.
[154:58.17]That's like circa 2015, 2016 or something.
[155:13.81]Wasn't that long ago?
[155:14.71]Oh, yeah, it was.
[155:15.47]That was at least three or four years ago.
[155:17.25]It was 2019.
[155:17.45]What are you talking about?
[155:26.75]Oh, oh, okay.
[155:27.69]You're talking about the, okay.
[155:28.77]I thought you meant the original one with me and Star from like 2015.
[155:32.67]Right, okay.
[155:33.99]You're talking about the one with the slime, the actual slime.
[155:48.80]Okay.
[155:50.22]260.
[155:50.42]We're at 295.
[155:53.15]Pull it back.
[155:53.65]Let's go.
[155:54.11]So we're looking for 260 to 320.
[155:56.15]We should be able to get a little bit of a view here.
[156:00.63]Keep an eye on that azimuth.
[156:04.61]I missed it.
[156:05.01]291.
[156:05.25]Stop.
[156:05.53]Stop.
[156:15.91]290, stop.
[156:17.01]290, 290?
[156:17.05]No.
[156:17.21]290.
[156:17.87]Stop.
[156:18.11]289 point.
[156:18.97]Hmm, interesting.
[156:40.68]289.7 289.5 289 288 288.2 That's not moving.
[156:41.36]283 What's happening?
[156:42.20]Let's do the stupid other one.
[156:43.22]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[156:45.07]Okay, 289.
[157:13.47]Oh, come on.
[157:15.05]291?
[157:15.07]Close.
[157:28.32]292.
[157:28.34]PogChamp.
[157:30.70]Where's PogChamp?
[157:31.85]PogChamp.
[157:32.37]PogChamp.
[157:32.79]What are you talking about?
[157:33.43]PogChamp is gone.
[157:34.11]PogChamp is deleted?
[157:37.73]Enable PogChamp.
[157:39.29]I didn't turn it off.
[157:44.34]Oh, come on.
[157:44.90]Really?
[157:45.92]291 decimals?
[157:56.08]Oh, stop it.
[157:59.86]Stop trying to do elevation.
[158:01.06]I don't care about elevation right now.
[158:14.01]They removed PogChamp.
[158:23.39]How am I missing this shit?
[158:24.51]Where is it?
[158:25.01]291.
[158:26.27]Ugh.
[158:26.37]290.
[158:26.39]Alright.
[158:28.11]There it is.

[161:05.26]Are they going to replace it with another PogChamp?
[161:08.06]Who replaces the PogChamp?
[161:09.28]What do you do?
[161:09.72]1.6 megabits second.
[161:14.42]Yeah, that sucks.
[161:28.18]8% download.
[161:28.52]That's so bad.
[161:33.94]It's gonna be you.
[161:35.08]It's not gonna be me.
[161:45.42]PogChamp is undergoing maintenance where it comes back as another guy.
[161:59.49]Is it just going to be another guy?
[162:00.87]So are we going to get PogChamp when it's not Pog?
[162:05.03]It's going to be like a different guy.
[162:10.95]Or will they even bring it back?
[162:26.52]wait is it is it time to is it time to shine it's time to stand up and be like hey uh are we gonna get is everybody gonna come out here and start saying like oh hey you know I got a PogChamp on my channel every single fucking Twitch streamer has their own version of PogChamp we're all vying for this space now all of us
[162:45.61]It is now every man for himself, every woman for himself to become the new PogChamp.
[162:52.94]There is not a single person on this whole website that does not have a PogChamp version of themself.
[163:00.86]I'm open for nominations here.
[163:02.20]It's not going to be me.
[163:12.57]I'm not going to win.
[163:23.60]It could be Slug Pog.
[163:29.18]It's going to be so many.
[163:31.02]Oh, my God.
[163:31.64]I can already see it.
[163:36.08]Who's going to be the new PogChamp?
[163:48.65]I mean, if there's like a tournament of PogChamps,
[163:54.71]And before that.
[164:13.22]Oh, let me see.
[164:21.28]We've made the decision to remove the Pog champion while following statements from the face of the emote encouraging further violence after what took place in the capital today.
[164:27.31]Wait, what?
[164:28.73]The fuck?
[164:39.83]We'll work with the community to design a new emote for the most hyped moments on Twitch.
[164:44.35]We want Pog to live on.
[164:45.55]His meaning is so much bigger than the person depicted or the image itself, and it's got a big place in Twitch culture.
[164:49.31]We can't... Holy shit, what the fuck is going on?
[165:02.46]Well...
[165:12.82]Now, I mean, I know about the stuff that's going on in the capital right now.
[165:16.28]But I know all of us know that that shit's going on.
[165:21.24]And it's been pretty stressful and pretty horrible to see.
[165:25.68]But I figured I would just want to try to pivot away from it and kind of at least escape for a little while.
[165:33.91]So I haven't really spoken on it at all.
[165:38.08]um let's just have fun let's it's obviously awful what's going on but we're going to continue to look for aliens right yeah this is this is wild I they need this they're going to be a new PogChamp or something
[166:12.13]But, I mean, I don't know what it's going to be.
[166:15.83]I have no idea what they're going to do.
[166:18.09]What are they even going to do?
[166:29.92]Yeah, I spent the whole morning pretty much going like, what the fuck is going on right now?
[166:36.49]What the fuck are you doing?
[166:38.07]What is going on?
[166:44.76]Remember before president?
[166:45.76]No.
[166:56.73]No, that's not gonna... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[167:03.93]Remember you're old enough to run.
[167:08.79]I wouldn't even make it past the... I wouldn't even make it past the first, like, little primary.
[167:15.95]Where they weed out the people that are just doing it as a joke like me.
[167:19.33]Become president.
[167:28.38]I wouldn't do it.
[167:29.12]I would be a terrible president.
[167:32.46]No.
[167:33.84]The jester does not get the crown.
[167:35.58]That's not.
[167:36.88]It would be bad.
[167:37.64]I would like drop the crown.
[167:46.31]thunder it would be a whole episode of this show where I dropped the crown and it shattered on the ground and I tried to glue it back together and pretend like I never dropped it with with a like a british TV show laugh track what happened whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what happened I lost signal
[168:15.82]I lost the signal, where is it?
[168:17.52]Oh, fuck.
[168:18.90]Oh well, back to bed.
[168:33.40]Check the bathroom.
[168:34.84]No.
[168:40.03]I would not vote for you, your opinions are awful.
[168:46.06]Okay.
[168:48.02]You can then vote for somebody else.
[168:50.76]But if enough people vote for me, I'm going to be the fucking president.
[169:09.23]Jerma985 has gotten 12 votes.
[169:16.41]All of his entire community went into the booth, chuckled at the fact that he was on the ballot, but said, nah, nah, I'm not a fucking idiot.
[169:23.40]I'm going to vote for like this person.
[169:24.60]Nah, this is like, that was a joke for like a week.
[169:29.50]My immediate family would vote for me.
[169:32.86]And actually, I'm not even sure that would be the case either.
[169:36.18]I'm not sure that would even be the case.
[169:38.36]I don't even, I don't think I'd even vote for myself.
[169:41.05]Because that's what you do.
[169:44.24]You vote for yourself.
[169:44.90]All these presidents and all these... They're voting for themselves.
[169:47.83]They're voting for themselves.
[169:49.13]They're not voting for the other guy.
[169:52.43]I don't even understand why they even ask.
[169:54.95]Why it's like, oh, who did you vote for?
[169:57.95]The guy trying to beat me in the election.
[170:02.13]You know, it would be funny to actually just do that.
[170:05.71]Just to say that.
[170:06.21]If you were the president.
[170:08.19]Like, oh, the president voted today.
[170:11.15]They went out, they came in, and let's get a little interview.
[170:14.06]Oh, Mr. President, you voted?
[170:16.56]I sure did.
[170:17.06]Who did you vote for?
[170:20.31]The other guy.
[170:21.15]I voted for the other candidate.
[170:23.83]I like their ideas.
[170:24.89]I think they've got a lot of things going for them.
[170:29.05]What would happen?
[170:31.70]Would you just lose?
[170:32.44]Or would you just be like, I wrote in Mickey Mouse.
[170:42.74]You vote for yourself.
[170:43.84]All of them.
[170:49.78]Okay, come out of the booth.
[170:51.27]Hold up the paper with the other person's name checkmarked.
[170:55.15]The other candidate.
[170:57.01]And say, I'm voting for Dean Dingus.
[171:00.31]I like his ideas.
[171:02.37]And by the way, I am resigning the presidency.
[171:08.74]What would happen to the news stations?
[171:17.60]Alright, I gotta find that signal again.
[171:24.83]It was right here, right?
[171:29.82]And then later on the next day, I say I was just kidding.
[171:32.44]Like, guys, that was a joke.
[171:35.48]That was a fucking joke.
[171:36.90]You think I would... What are you talking about?
[172:02.99]And then the other guy goes no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think so He's gonna do that shit.
[172:08.59]He's just got all the cameras on him.
[172:09.77]Everyone's like talking about everybody's got he's got like a piece fucking trending I Resigned my design the nomination.
[172:16.88]I
[172:20.53]Is that how you get like a Mickey Mouse president?
[172:25.65]But then if Mickey Mouse got like 11, like 5 to 10,000 votes, like 11,000, 10,000 votes, right?
[172:30.81]Would Mickey Mouse become the president?
[172:34.63]Is that how that would work?
[172:41.44]On election night, they both say they're resigning.
[172:46.10]And they have to figure out who the 1.0%, like 1.2% other votes were.
[172:52.48]Like Aquaman has like 100 votes, and he's on that CNN screen of potential fucking presidents.
[172:59.20]You got Mickey Mouse, Aquaman, Benjamin Franklin, and Kanye.
[173:05.08]Oh boy.
[173:08.00]That sounds like a Jerma rumble match.
[173:19.06]Auto.
[173:28.47]Confirmed for next year.
[173:29.67]Alright, where is this shit?
[173:32.21]1 and 12.
[173:33.01]Okay, that's easy.
[173:33.63]No, it's not.
[173:34.23]It's going to take forever.
[173:35.01]Alright, 1 and 22.
[173:37.73]Oh, let's just start it.
[173:51.67]How am I doing?
[173:52.31]Is my power okay?
[173:53.05]How am I doing on power?
[173:55.41]Oh, fuck.
[173:57.51]How do I make efficiency better?
[174:00.41]My charge efficiency is 93%.
[174:01.95]Power consumption.
[174:04.19]How do I get more power?
[174:05.45]What do I do?
[174:11.07]Turn off antennas when they aren't moving.
[174:13.93]Make the sun brighter.
[174:14.91]Start the generator?
[174:20.43]Oh, shit.
[174:20.79]Okay.
[174:31.35]On the next Game of Thrones.
[174:39.42]Satellites aren't calibrated, they aren't?
[174:48.75]Previously on the next Game of Thrones.
[174:54.96]Um, elevation is doing fine.
[174:57.30]31.
[174:57.40]Let's get that to, uh, it needs to be like, uh, 30, uh, 30.
[175:14.55]It's getting there.
[175:16.59]This 300 is going to take a long time.
[175:17.97]Actually, no, it's not.
[175:18.83]Shouldn't take that long.
[175:19.53]27.
[175:21.77]Is that going up?
[175:27.64]Komodo crew activated.
[175:29.64]360 to zero.
[175:37.00]Yeah, that's not that far.
[175:37.96]I mean, it is, but it isn't.
[175:47.88]What is it?
[175:48.24]Why am I being spammed?
[175:56.40]Moment.
[175:58.00]And thanks among themselves.
[175:59.61]Is that Jerma?
[176:01.17]What the fuck is that?
[176:03.07]That we can disagree with one another.
[176:05.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[176:07.41]What?
[176:08.13]Are you fucking kidding me?
[176:10.81]Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
[176:14.07]I'm doing a new Kill the Meme stream.
[176:17.19]I'm going to shoot a bow and arrow right through Jermasus' forehead.
[176:22.44]He's got to go.
[176:23.18]Jermasus has got to go.
[176:27.95]I should have done it in a rumble.
[176:33.95]It's a fake image.
[176:34.97]Oh.
[176:38.31]You're going to Beyonce it.
[176:41.20]Streisand effect.
[176:42.38]I know.
[176:42.84]I know.
[176:43.30]That's why we talk about it, don't we?
[177:01.84]He's going insane.
[177:02.94]Oh, my fucking God.
[177:14.09]Oh, calibrate the antenna.
[177:15.34]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[177:22.80]I need to wait till I get this.
[177:24.44]How do I wait?
[177:26.81]Oh, do you calibrate the antenna?
[177:30.66]River temperature 45.8 degrees.
[177:31.86]Is that Celsius?
[177:34.06]Do a diagnostics on the server.
[177:39.25]Open.
[177:45.99]By the way, change your fucking router password.
[177:47.61]You know, like nobody does.
[177:55.73]What do I do?
[177:56.27]Diagnostics.
[178:02.37]okay mom there's no reason to so why even have a password on it then do you really think that your like kid or something is going to get onto the router what are they going to do why is there a password on the router if that's the case what are you preventing somebody from doing you know how much of pain in the ass it is to type in like one nine eight dot one dot zero dot zero what it is and hit enter
[178:31.19]It's because you have no Roblox turned on after 9 p.m.
[178:33.77]So they could go on there and they could take the, uh, the Roblox server off the ban list.
[178:42.58]I mean.
[178:50.62]You can turn the password off.
[178:53.02]Can't you also just reset the router with like a pen to that one little spot that you just hold the button down and it just goes to factory?
[179:03.48]Why even have a password?
[179:09.18]It sets it to the default password.
[179:10.62]Right.
[179:11.06]So, um... It doesn't go to factory?
[179:13.32]You sure?
[179:13.64]Return to... Return an error.
[179:17.99]Antenna server timeout.
[179:27.41]So people in your house can't get in.
[179:29.93]The neighbors stealing the Wi-Fi.
[179:32.17]Well, no, no.
[179:32.69]That's the Wi-Fi.
[179:33.71]That's the password to get onto your Wi-Fi, not the password of your router.
[179:39.81]You have to be on the network to get onto the router.
[179:44.35]Right?
[179:47.49]Why are we talking about this?
[179:49.13]Does this really matter?
[179:50.71]Who brought this up?
[179:53.65]Who brought this up?
[179:54.45]Why are we even talking about this?
[179:55.37]This is the dumbest conversation I think we've ever had.
[180:01.24]It's alright.
[180:01.62]I'll see you previously on the next Game of Thrones.
[180:07.66]I did?
[180:10.95]It was always you.
[180:11.97]No, it wasn't always me.
[180:15.77]Alright, so.
[180:17.80]We need to go to... It's almost there.

[181:03.00]Alright, it's 30.90.
[181:11.51]30.90.
[181:11.53]We need this to go.
[181:13.87]To... Oh, just keep it going.
[181:15.35]Whatever.
[181:19.79]Whatever.
[181:32.92]Jedi Academy died for this.
[181:34.86]No, Jedi Academy is going to be played tomorrow.
[181:39.26]That's what we're doing tomorrow.
[181:40.82]Jedi Academy is tomorrow.
[181:42.66]I just leaked it.
[181:45.66]I'm sorry, I leaked it.
[181:56.49]Alright, I'm going to already stop this.
[182:00.77]Are you lying?
[182:01.35]No.
[182:01.55]30.9 is what I need.
[182:03.25]Alright, let's see.
[182:08.12]We got 3 to 15.
[182:08.52]So we're getting there.
[182:09.88]Here we go.
[182:10.42]We're at 3.
[182:11.06]I'm going to have 30.90 is what we need.
[182:14.28]30.90.
[182:14.30]Right there is good.
[182:17.60]Boot it up.
[182:29.08]Five.
[182:30.68]Keep an eye on that, uh, Azimuth.
[182:35.46]Think you're gonna have ray tracing?
[182:36.70]I don't have a 2080.
[182:37.96]I have a 1080.
[182:39.80]Still.
[182:40.82]After all these years.
[182:48.34]Really?
[182:49.18]Five, seven to 72.
[182:51.48]Are you kidding me?
[182:52.12]This one sucks.
[183:01.62]It works just fine.
[183:02.44]I have not had any problems with 1080.
[183:06.96]You can't run Watch Dogs Legions, but why would you want to run that game in the first place?
[183:19.99]I'm perfectly fine with the 1080 right now.
[183:23.47]It's sturdy.
[183:24.11]It's hardy.
[183:26.11]Some would call it the Super Nintendo of the NVIDIA GPUs.
[183:30.01]It's the perfect card.
[183:43.86]65 is the max.
[183:44.92]Alright, well.
[183:51.80]760 is the Super Nintendo.
[183:55.00]No, I don't know, but I don't think I agree with that.
[184:04.37]Here's the Christmas Deluxe Bundle event.
[184:07.93]The 1080 will get you at least three more years of high.
[184:10.17]You need a better CPU for streaming, though.
[184:11.79]Yeah, I know.
[184:14.12]Now, once GPUs come back in stock, really, and people don't have to make, like, Discord bots to figure out when they can buy one, I'll get one.
[184:34.05]What's my CPU?
[184:34.43]I76850K.
[184:34.51]Six core.
[184:34.77]Stopped.
[184:41.63]Okay, we need... Where are we at?
[184:43.98]31?
[184:44.98]We need to go back to 30.
[184:45.54]30?
[184:45.66]Is this gonna be like a mirror here?
[184:50.16]Okay, we need 30.
[184:53.36]Go like, yeah, 30 and 39.
[184:54.48]Let's do that.
[184:55.22]Okay.
[184:58.57]I fucking missed it.
[184:59.61]30, um... Is it 32?
[185:02.27]I missed it.
[185:02.79]What was it?
[185:03.09]30.5.
[185:04.73]Oh, shit. 29?
[185:12.42]Wait, what was it then?
[185:13.06]31?
[185:17.55]No, dummy.
[185:20.21]Don't change that.
[185:29.94]Come on.
[185:30.34]Hurry up.
[185:31.20]Come on.
[185:31.64]31.
[185:33.52]Come on.
[185:42.36]30.5.
[185:44.04]And we... This is moving around too much.
[185:48.78]30 point... This is looking... This is moving around all the... How do I... It's the calibration bullshit.
[185:57.47]Now auto-track it.
[186:04.71]Is it downloading?
[186:06.73]0.4 megabytes a second.
[186:08.21]What is that bullshit?
[186:13.84]What?
[186:21.49]Oh my god.
[186:22.39]I have to reboot the server?
[186:29.55]I don't even know what to do.
[186:30.58]Connection with server.
[186:37.30]Is there a server tutorial?
[186:42.54]Where's my mouse?
[186:51.21]Calibration.
[186:54.10]You can check the calibration status for all antennas in the terminal.
[186:56.00]Okay.
[186:56.22]Calibration.
[186:56.48]Calibration.
[186:56.94]Okay.
[186:58.04]Calibration.
[187:01.22]Okay.
[187:01.40]Um...
[187:17.59]So how do I... These are all wrong.
[187:19.18]I have to make these all zero?
[187:25.70]Oh, Jesus.
[187:31.86]Diagnostics.
[187:32.62]Cal start?
[187:36.42]Cal start.
[187:41.89]Antenna controls and detection disabled.
[187:44.93]Oh, fuck.
[187:47.92]I'm still downloading this.
[187:53.29]I gotta pee again.
[187:54.23]I'll be right back.
[187:54.95]Pee time.
[190:28.81]I'm back.
[190:32.04]Hey, Happy New Year.
[190:35.58]It's you.
[190:42.81]Why is it always a break, but never a poop break?
[190:47.05]Oh, well, it's really easy to explain.
[190:49.15]Because I typically don't, like, need to poop during his stream.
[190:57.74]I'll give you a streamer tidbit of knowledge that's insider information.
[191:01.97]I'd say 70% of every single reason why a streamer is late is because they are currently taking a shit.
[191:13.27]And they want to make sure they don't have to shit during the stream.
[191:16.51]So that's why I would say at least 75% of the time.
[191:24.96]That's what's going on.
[191:30.95]And here's the worst part.
[191:32.80]When you start to feel it coming on, let's say I'm going to start streaming at 3 o'clock Pacific.
[191:39.28]At like 2.45, if I start to feel it coming on, it's, oh, okay.
[191:47.34]I know if I start streaming at 3, that's going to be ready to, I'm going to have to do something.
[191:52.37]I have to take care of that at like 4, like 3.30.
[191:55.13]And I don't, am I going to have to just go take off for like 30 minutes?
[192:01.35]So you just delay.
[192:02.43]You say, oh, hey, man, I'm having some technical difficulties.
[192:05.49]One of my wires is plugged in weird.
[192:07.01]My USB stick, I can't get it to fit the right way.
[192:09.33]You can never get it the first try.
[192:10.93]See you in 45 minutes.
[192:12.31]And you wait till it's ready.
[192:13.55]You take care of it.
[192:14.15]So then you can stream for like four or five, six hours without having to worry about it.
[192:21.40]That image, by the way, that you're looking at right now was on Travis Touchdown's T-shirt.
[192:28.24]And that's in full HD.
[192:29.30]Okay.
[192:31.40]That was the one.
[192:32.04]That was it right there.
[192:36.26]You got to see it up close.
[192:42.09]Casino Inc.
[192:42.69]got robbed.
[192:43.81]A lot of people think that.
[192:44.65]Alright, let's go.
[192:53.97]That's a good dick dash, Lead Richard.
[192:56.62]What was I doing?
[193:00.71]Wait, it's calibrating the antenna.
[193:05.05]Do I have to do this?
[193:05.91]Or is it doing it on its own?
[193:08.65]Oh shit, it's doing it on its own.
[193:10.01]It's doing it.
[193:12.97]Still downloading at 7.8%.
[193:13.73]He said he would stream Doki Doki Literature Club.
[193:30.72]No.
[193:39.77]I already know, like, you can't... If I play Doki Doki Literature Club...
[193:45.42]I... First of all, I don't play those games anyways.
[193:48.62]I don't play that kind of game.
[193:50.64]So that's strike one.
[193:52.32]Strike two is... So many of you guys told me to watch the movie.
[193:56.86]And hey, watch this movie, dude.
[193:58.79]You're gonna love it.
[193:59.55]Especially after the first hour.
[194:02.39]Oh, wait.
[194:03.01]Hey, this movie, it's such a good movie.
[194:05.81]Just wait till you watch it for an hour.
[194:07.47]And then let me know what you think.
[194:09.11]Okay, cool.
[194:10.47]So I know something fucking happens in like an hour.
[194:12.35]It's gonna be like a big twist or something.
[194:14.13]Great.
[194:14.67]Thanks for telling me.
[194:15.33]Now at like 59 minutes.
[194:18.67]When one hour crosses.
[194:21.17]I now know.
[194:23.23]Here it comes.
[194:23.65]Will this thing calibrate or what?
[194:28.94]Oh, it's doing all of them.
[194:32.98]Doesn't matter.
[194:33.40]Do it anyways.
[194:35.39]You want me to pretend to be excited and pretend to be shocked when the thing that everybody wrote, Pepe Laff, he doesn't know?
[194:42.95]You know how many times I've seen Pepe Laff, he doesn't know, he doesn't know about Doki Doki Literature Club?
[194:48.69]You want me to pretend to be shocked when I see the thing that happens?
[195:00.44]Calibration takes a while.
[195:01.48]Oh, okay.
[195:01.82]I'm getting more power, by the way.
[195:04.81]That's good.
[195:07.51]Is it still downloading?
[195:08.29]This sound needs to turn down.
[195:12.59]Not the right one.
[195:16.09]I don't know which one of these is making that sound.
[195:20.71]What I... What is making that sound?
[195:27.60]Okay, it was the stupid-ass TV.
[195:35.46]My room is covered in posters with one of the Doki Doki characters.
[195:40.28]Alright.
[195:46.22]Wait, is there something... What do you want me to say about that?
[195:51.99]Um, alright.
[195:56.95]Rare TV spam.
[196:00.39]That's right.
[196:01.31]Rare TV spam.
[196:06.87]Hey, remember when I was going to remove BaldCoin?
[196:10.94]I held on to removing BaldCoin long enough for it to be relevant again.
[196:20.66]I should have held the real thing long enough.
[196:24.82]Right?
[196:28.14]But no, I kept the emote.
[196:30.78]I held the emote, but not the asset.
[196:34.65]What a fucking dope.
[196:43.36]He sold Omega Lull.
[196:44.56]Not all of it.
[196:45.62]Not all of it.
[196:49.25]I have enough to open up an account, look at it, and go... And then close it.
[196:57.44]Because I got out like two years ago.
[197:06.62]I have enough, I have just enough, and I had more previously, for me to be in the shower randomly.
[197:12.13]Like, once every, like, two or three months now.
[197:15.09]To just go, like, get the shampoo in there.
[197:19.91]There it is.
[197:20.65]That feels pretty good.
[197:23.05]Fucking should have held, I had, I should have held them.
[197:28.16]That feels good.
[197:34.20]Just turn the water off, you know?
[197:37.47]You have Ethereum?
[197:39.09]No.
[197:40.97]Why is it quiet?
[197:44.28]How come?
[197:44.58]Oh, I turned all the volume down on everything.
[197:47.52]I kind of miss the, like, frog sounds, don't you?
[197:50.96]Yeah, I miss the summertime frog sounds.
[198:08.39]This is an alternate universe.
[198:10.31]What shampoo do you use?
[198:11.75]I use Lush.
[198:12.61]Everybody asks that all the time.
[198:15.53]Why do people ask that?
[198:23.30]Calibrate this already.
[198:24.40]I lost all my data.
[198:30.18]Please be joking.
[198:30.98]Why is it a joke?
[198:31.60]I use Lush.
[198:36.61]I use big in veganese.
[198:38.29]I'm not vegan.
[198:39.47]I just happen to like the conditioner.
[198:41.37]It makes my hair feel nice.
[198:48.32]Omeglel.
[198:48.84]He's vegan.
[198:49.42]Omeglel.
[198:49.92]There you go.
[198:50.88]Fine.
[199:01.06]Is it weird that I feel like the word vegan just... It's not even... It just activates a bunch of bots that write the word Omega Lul Vegan.
[199:10.67]Like, I don't think people are writing that.
[199:11.91]I think you have like a notepad that has a bunch of like random insults on it that are copy and pasted.
[199:17.87]Like a bot that's set up that just says Omega Lul Vegan every time the word vegan is heard.
[199:29.19]Because it's immediate.
[199:32.89]Holy shit.
[199:33.65]Antenna number four is fucked.
[199:36.46]We have to get a new one.
[199:49.49]Go to sleep now.
[199:50.39]Oh, that's not a bad idea.
[199:57.46]He said the vegan word.
[199:58.96]Check bathroom.
[200:01.74]I love baths though, I'll tell you.
[200:03.24]I'm a big fan of baths.
[200:07.41]Drinks Huel and uses vegan shampoo.
[200:09.69]This streamer is fucked.
[200:18.98]Huel?
[200:19.38]I like Huel.
[200:20.96]I will die on that Huel.
[200:27.63]You can- Alright, fine.
[200:28.57]You can fight me on the lush thing if you want, really?
[200:31.65]You'll lose?
[200:32.11]Like, I mean, you're gonna lose because, I mean, it's just- I like the product.
[200:36.46]You're not gonna win the heal argument with me.
[200:47.34]He wears a healing bracelet.
[200:48.82]No, I had- I told- Didn't- In that video, I even said, I don't believe in this.
[200:53.43]It just looked cool.
[201:03.48]I'm not wearing a healing bracelet right now.
[201:05.54]And if I was, whatever.
[201:09.73]You know, it doesn't matter.
[201:12.35]It's my life.
[201:13.19]If I want to wear a vegan healing bracelet, I'm going to.
[201:17.27]It's my life.
[201:18.16]So you don't have to worry about it.
[201:19.24]Did I sleep?
[201:41.24]What's your skincare routine?
[201:43.30]I use a microexfoliant.
[201:45.22]Let me say that again.
[201:46.52]I use a microexfoliant every three days.
[201:50.02]And then I use a gel cleanser each night.
[202:03.01]I do.
[202:04.37]I use an eye serum.
[202:07.91]All real.
[202:09.61]Every maybe three or four nights, I use an eye serum underneath my eyes at night.
[202:14.38]You tap it in because I'm starting to get little crow's feet and stuff.
[202:17.58]That's not vegan.
[202:22.93]And I try to drink at least six to eight glasses of water a day.
[202:44.90]Is water vegan?
[202:49.34]Think about it.
[202:55.84]Don't like... Don't like squirrels and stuff like die in the water and everything?
[203:01.31]Don't like fish like die and stuff in the water?
[203:13.32]It gets like processed, right?
[203:14.44]But...
[203:16.00]Is water vegan?
[203:17.68]Why is it at zero?
[203:18.40]It's because it's fucking nighttime.
[203:26.45]No, they filter out the squirrels.
[203:28.75]Oh, fuck.
[203:34.13]Somebody said this is literally a fossil fuel tier level argument.
[203:38.95]I don't even know what that means, but it made me laugh.
[203:42.94]They filter out the squirrels.
[203:57.72]I'm trying to piece together what that means.
[203:59.26]A fossil fuel tier level argument?
[204:03.32]Fossil fuel.
[204:04.14]Fossil fuels equal animals.
[204:07.00]It's not vegan.
[204:09.56]But you don't drink fossil fuels.
[204:11.76]You don't drink gasoline.
[204:28.12]Okay, not enough data.
[204:30.78]Let's recalibrate.
[204:32.00]I still have a signal, right?
[204:34.12]Do I not have a signal anymore?
[204:36.76]Oh, set.
[204:39.66]Oh, set.
[204:40.30]You're a whole bunch of liars.
[204:48.21]Yeah, they are.
[204:49.87]It's just what they do.
[205:02.93]Look, I've had plenty.
[205:04.61]I've had vegan food that was good.
[205:07.45]I've had vegetarian food that was good.
[205:08.83]I've had meat that was delicious.
[205:10.93]Come on.
[205:18.52]You can't enjoy something that is just plant-based?
[205:21.20]Why?
[205:21.42]Why not?
[205:25.95]I don't have to, like, pray to, like, a vegan god to, like, enjoy a vegan-based meal.
[205:39.06]I don't have to have, like, a shrine to a head of lettuce or something.
[205:43.24]To be, like, a vegetarian.
[205:49.89]Sometimes it's nice.
[205:51.03]This is, like, good.
[205:51.83]I know it's not going to be... I'm going to feel, like, light.
[205:53.43]It's not going to be heavy.
[205:54.39]It's...
[205:56.82]Come on.
[206:12.16]Your skin's gonna turn green.
[206:18.68]Breaking news.
[206:19.18]People don't need to go to extremes.
[206:23.44]Like I've had Beyond Burgers before.
[206:27.06]with like vegan cheese on it I was like this is good this this this taste this is guy this is I don't hate this this is this is good this is fine sometimes you just want like a butternut squash soup
[206:52.17]And a little piece of toast.
[206:53.71]Is there something wrong with that?
[206:55.95]No, I don't want to drop a meat patty in there today.
[206:58.07]Not today.
[206:58.87]It's okay.
[206:59.49]That's fine.
[207:11.96]You guys are taking the BK stacker commercial way too literally.
[207:15.20]And I knew when they aired that, that was a bad idea.
[207:18.67]The second it aired, I was like, this is a bad idea.
[207:20.51]What they're doing here.
[207:22.40]Welcome to the stackers union, buddy.
[207:24.26]Meat and cheese.
[207:25.42]No veggies.
[207:27.06]And that was cool.
[207:29.07]This is probably not a good idea that they're doing this.
[207:39.35]Burger King leaned into don't put vegetables on your burgers because they're gross.
[207:44.84]Meat and cheese only.
[207:45.76]It's like, okay.
[207:48.60]It's not a good idea.
[207:53.60]184, 14.
[207:53.64]God damn it.
[207:57.02]Well, I calibrated, right?
[207:57.92]Gonna take all day.
[208:00.33]200, fuck.
[208:09.15]Go!
[208:10.92]Um... These vegetables would be extra expensive.
[208:19.87]If I wanted lettuce and tomatoes, I'd order a fucking salad, but I want a salad.
[208:22.93]I want a burger.
[208:29.13]Well, I agree with you with the tomato part, but there's other vegetables that are not tomatoes.
[208:34.26]And... Sometimes you want that.
[208:38.58]Sometimes I just want, like, A1 steak sauce.
[208:42.62]But, excuse me.
[208:44.00]Back up.
[208:46.18]Meat.
[208:46.32]Cheese.
[208:47.80]Cheese.
[208:49.60]Grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, A1 steak sauce.
[208:52.86]Excuse me.
[208:55.97]I find that to be very, very good.
[209:01.27]Now, if somebody wants to be mad at me for that, you've not eaten it yet.
[209:05.65]And you will just be swearing into your hands with a full burger with everything I just told you to put on it.
[209:11.48]And you'll be like, fucking idiot.
[209:12.86]Fucking dumb.
[209:13.84]I fucking hate that guy.
[209:15.00]He's so stupid.
[209:15.76]He's so dumb.
[209:16.48]He couldn't get the signal right in the fucking game.
[209:18.26]I did.
[209:19.40]The game's fucking easy.
[209:20.44]It took him two hours.
[209:21.79]This sandwich stinks.
[209:22.89]It smells.
[209:23.27]I hate this.
[209:23.63]This guy sucks.
[209:24.69]I fucking hate this fucking guy.
[209:27.55]This is really good.
[209:28.85]This is really good.
[209:29.37]He fucking couldn't even figure out the signal.
[209:31.35]This is wicked good.
[209:51.24]How do I have no power?
[209:52.32]I have to reboot the whole base.
[209:58.92]Did I reboot the entire base?
[210:01.50]Is that how this works?
[210:07.06]Okay.
[210:08.84]Set password?
[210:10.06]Okay.
[210:15.24]New password.
[210:15.92]Set new password.
[210:17.00]Set pass.
[210:17.70]What?
[210:18.86]No.
[210:19.24]Set pass.
[210:22.14]Set pass.
[210:41.66]It doesn't even work.
[210:44.30]What's the security hole here?
[210:57.92]How do you not feel heavier after vegan meals?
[211:00.20]Half of them are entirely carbs.
[211:04.80]I... I don't... I just... All I said was I... What do you mean?
[211:14.24]Lettuce?
[211:16.02]Tomato?
[211:17.38]Mushrooms?
[211:23.99]Look, okay, I know I keep saying lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, and onions, but that's not vegan meals.
[211:28.35]That's just, that's like the condiment level of vegan food.
[211:33.92]Right?
[211:34.12]Like lettuce, tomato, onions, mushrooms.
[211:37.44]That's not a vegan meal.
[211:38.46]That's vegan condiment.
[211:40.98]That's just, that's if you add this stuff.
[211:52.48]I love grilled onions, though.
[211:55.34]Hey, guess what?
[211:56.20]That's a vegetable.
[211:58.24]No, it's not.
[211:58.60]No, it's not.
[211:59.88]It's meat.
[212:04.11]The whole base is off.
[212:08.25]I need to go to bed.
[212:14.59]Turn the generator back on.
[212:16.97]Alright, there we go.
[212:24.15]Seafood onions.
[212:24.95]I don't know what you mean by seafood onions, but I love seafood and I love onions, but I'm not sure I would put them together.
[212:33.42]You know what?
[212:33.70]I'm a big fan of crab cakes.
[212:35.42]Anybody else?
[212:36.98]Crab cakes?
[212:40.34]I like California rolls, but not with the fake crab.
[212:45.85]I like it with actual crab.
[212:54.21]And I didn't just tell you that that's the only roll I ever eat.
[212:57.11]I like spicy tuna.
[212:58.59]I like salmon rolls.
[213:00.49]Raw.
[213:01.25]So relax.
[213:04.67]I didn't just say California roll is the only sushi I've ever eaten.
[213:08.92]And I will fight you if you disagree with me.
[213:11.52]I did not say that.
[213:12.18]I just said I like them.
[213:16.18]We get a new download speed here.
[213:23.83]Come on.
[213:25.11]Charge this shit.
[213:31.47]California rolls are boring.
[213:38.48]So fake California roll.
[213:40.02]What do you think about Korean barbecue?
[213:42.74]I love it.
[213:43.08]It's awesome.
[213:44.48]The generator.
[213:45.04]Yeah, I just turned it on.
[213:50.01]It's boring, but good.
[213:50.94]Yeah, just... You know what else is boring?
[213:53.96]A cheeseburger.
[213:55.48]It's meat, cheese, and bread.
[213:56.68]But they're delicious.
[213:58.96]Quarter Pounder for the win.
[214:10.39]I agree.
[214:11.91]Quarter Pounder better than Whopper.
[214:15.13]Although Whopper bigger than Quarter Pounder, so...
[214:21.48]Check that rock outside.
[214:22.54]I feel like I've not done anything in the game.
[214:26.06]In probably 25 straight minutes.
[214:27.82]We've just been talking.
[214:29.42]You know, sometimes that's what you do.
[214:31.02]We're just hanging out.
[214:34.23]Are we going to see the alien before the stream turns off?
[214:36.51]Probably not.
[214:38.37]Check the rock.
[215:09.03]$500 million in research, um, like 10 years of developing this place.
[215:18.28]Telescopes, equipment, radars, light speed we can see into the distance.
[215:27.84]And I picked a shoe up on the ground and that's how I found them.
[215:33.03]I just came and picked up a shoe and found the alien.
[215:47.79]Um, I don't have a cam- and here, right now, I'm sitting here surrounded.
[215:55.35]Look around in a circle.
[215:57.57]Cameras.
[215:58.79]Audio equipment.
[216:00.97]Detectors.
[216:03.64]Circling me.
[216:04.94]But I don't have any way to capture what I just looked at.
[216:11.32]That, in the middle of the research facility, no way, nothing captured that.
[216:20.49]Just my eyes and now I have... How disappointed is this walk back?
[216:26.39]This must be the worst thing that this has ever fucking happened.
[216:31.27]Just like... Oh no!
[216:34.47]Look at all this stuff!
[216:37.52]But it was... My entire life was dedicated.
[216:42.02]And nobody's gonna believe me.
[216:46.11]oh well I guess we're gonna try to listen to like deep sea noises 10 million years away for another 20 years no one's gonna believe me sit on the bench can I at least get like a disposable camera from Walmart
[217:20.50]Wait, maybe I'll, okay.
[217:22.08]We have all this expensive equipment, but what if it was just something very simple?
[217:25.38]You know, we're trying too hard.
[217:47.53]Nope.
[217:54.67]Good link.
[217:55.27]Alright, fine.
[217:55.71]I'll be the judge of that.
[217:59.29]This isn't the right link.
[218:01.79]I mean, that was alright.
[218:16.11]Okay.
[218:17.09]Do we have power?
[218:20.08]We do.
[218:21.90]At 0.29% efficiency.
[218:27.54]I stopped downloading?
[218:29.58]Actual link.
[218:30.32]What the fuck?
[218:39.41]Okay.
[218:48.78]Not that one.
[219:10.20]Wait a minute, what do you got here?
[219:12.66]You got McDonald's in the basket down there.
[219:15.24]I like it.
[219:16.50]A nice berry heel.
[219:18.06]Alright, cool.
[219:20.93]A healing bracelet.
[219:23.19]And a lush shampoo.
[219:26.71]This looks pretty good to me.
[219:27.91]I don't have a problem with any of these things.
[219:33.19]This seems like a really good Friday night to me.
[219:46.31]Shoes in the tub.
[219:48.60]No.
[219:50.48]Purple alien.
[219:51.24]Purple alien has become an influencer.
[220:01.94]I think I just have to turn everything off.
[220:03.66]And just let the facility charge for like an hour.
[220:18.94]And why is it that I cannot use the facility while it's plugged in?
[220:26.08]If it's dead.
[220:30.69]I can't stand that.
[220:34.79]When I'm sitting there, if you have a dead phone...
[220:38.21]And you plug it in.
[220:39.93]Sometimes you have to wait like 10 straight minutes for the thing to turn on because it runs on battery.
[220:44.45]It doesn't, you can't, there's no such thing as running on AC with a phone.
[220:48.07]Like, why can't I run my phone off the wall?
[220:51.63]That pisses me off all the time.
[220:59.87]Because what you're doing is you're not running off the wall.
[221:02.41]You're charging the battery and running off the battery.
[221:05.38]You're not running off the wall.
[221:06.64]And I don't know if they're concerned that, oh, but if you unplug it, but you're running on the battery.
[221:12.24]Who cares?
[221:14.44]Circuits can't run off AC.
[221:18.52]The Android can do it.
[221:20.13]Can it?
[221:25.33]Phones don't run on AC.
[221:28.15]Yeah, but I mean, that annoys me.
[221:31.31]I'll be in the middle of doing something and my phone will die and it's like, oh, fuck.
[221:35.18]I'll just plug it in.
[221:36.82]And I'm just sitting there with my hands on my face.
[221:39.60]Staring at this thing.
[221:41.80]Like five to ten straight minutes.
[221:44.32]Like, check it.
[221:44.94]No, I can't turn it on.
[221:46.67]Check.
[221:46.97]Turn the fuck on.
[221:48.75]I'll leave.
[221:49.23]I'll have to go do something.
[221:50.79]I come back.
[221:51.35]It's still not on.
[221:52.71]Hold the button down.
[221:53.57]Finally.
[221:53.95]Oh, there it is.
[221:54.67]There's the Apple symbol.
[221:56.37]And it's at like 12% charge.
[221:58.29]Well, why didn't you turn on when you were at like 5%?
[222:01.55]What's that bullshit?
[222:06.79]It's very, very annoying.
[222:15.22]Android phones can turn on at 1%.
[222:18.98]Then I have to relearn an operating system.
[222:20.48]I don't want to do that.
[222:29.09]I already know where everything is on iPhone.
[222:30.71]I already know what to do.
[222:31.83]I already know where everything is.
[222:33.27]I don't want to like have to get out.
[222:36.23]I've been using Apple mobile devices since I was like fucking, I don't know, like 20, 25 or something.
[222:48.69]I use Apple for all my mobile devices, but I've refused to use Apple for a desktop.
[222:56.74]And I'm getting to the point where I might start.
[222:58.06]I think I might switch.
[222:59.74]Android.
[223:10.57]Thinking about it.
[223:12.57]They really pissed me off with that iPhone 12 mini bullshit.
[223:15.35]I'm serious.
[223:16.38]That made me irrationally upset.
[223:20.64]Those of you that don't understand what I'm talking about, there's a lot of people that might not have been here like six months ago when I talked about this.
[223:26.53]The iPhone SE comes out.
[223:29.26]And it's a little phone.
[223:30.58]It's the iPhone 4 case.
[223:32.52]It's a little guy.
[223:33.58]It's just a compact phone.
[223:34.96]That's what I want.
[223:35.68]That's what I wanted.
[223:38.32]I hate this big-ass phone bullshit.
[223:40.02]I hate the huge bricks in your pocket.
[223:42.65]I need to carry it around like a fanny pack.
[223:44.55]Or like a backpack to carry around an iPhone.
[223:46.59]No.
[223:46.97]Or an Android.
[223:47.83]All of them.
[223:48.23]They're huge.
[223:48.95]It's stupid.
[223:49.55]I don't like how big they are.
[223:50.33]It's annoying to me.
[223:52.21]So, they are teasing.
[223:54.77]They're teasing there might be an iPhone SE 2.
[224:00.12]Oh, my God.
[224:01.56]iPhone SE 2?
[224:02.40]Are you kidding me?
[224:03.73]iPhone SE 2?
[224:05.59]It's going to be small, right?
[224:06.63]Because everybody loved it.
[224:07.51]People have been begging them to make that, right?
[224:10.79]The iPhone SE 2 is not small.
[224:14.39]It's just a standard iPhone size.
[224:16.37]And it looked like they were never going to make a small one again.
[224:18.99]You'd think that the SE, SE 2, would be the same thing.
[224:22.18]You made a little phone.
[224:23.28]It was the SE.
[224:24.20]The SE 2 was not a little phone.
[224:26.49]And they, there's no, they don't tell anybody anything.
[224:29.59]Oh, well, no, just wait.
[224:30.41]We are making a small one.
[224:31.81]Nope.
[224:31.99]They just fucking announced one day randomly that like iPhone 12 mini is now a thing.
[224:37.78]After everybody that was an SE fan bought the SE2 thinking this is the smallest phone we were going to get.
[224:43.06]These, these, you know, these, I, they came up with iPhone 12 mini like six months later.
[224:53.53]And it's the exact thing that I wanted.
[224:55.47]So now, do I have to go buy a new iPhone?
[224:58.95]Go trade in the SE?
[225:00.14]That's horse shit.
[225:04.40]That's absolute dog shit.
[225:05.90]They just want to put a 12 on it.
[225:08.76]They want to put a 12 on it.
[225:10.18]So people go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[225:10.84]I got that one.
[225:11.42]I want 12.
[225:11.62]Ugh.
[225:11.70]SE?
[225:11.76]What's that?
[225:12.06]Super?
[225:12.20]Extreme?
[225:12.38]I don't...
[225:26.48]Twelve means better.
[225:28.38]Twelve small.
[225:29.80]Oh.
[225:30.66]Angry.
[225:31.56]Angry.
[225:31.90]It makes me so angry.
[225:44.33]What the fuck?
[225:52.34]Mike, you've been hot this whole time.
[225:56.50]Can you get back to work?
[225:58.24]We've heard everything.
[225:58.86]I don't know who you're talking to, but we've heard reports that there's some new sounds at Sector 21.
[226:06.77]Yeah, I'll get right on that.
[226:10.09]Thanks, Mike.
[226:14.99]See, I'll talk to you after work or something?
[226:16.60]No.
[226:17.92]Alright, I'll talk to you after work.
[226:20.79]No, you're not.
[226:21.69]No.
[226:22.11]Okay.
[226:22.31]I'll see you later.
[226:22.85]Bye.
[226:24.39]Alright.
[226:24.91]After work, going to have a fun time.
[226:27.33]We're going to go out and go to Chuck E. Cheese.
[226:36.78]Alright.
[226:37.86]I'm just going to hang up my line.
[226:40.00]I'm going to unplug my line.
[226:46.08]How are we still at 3.3%?
[226:46.64]This is fucking bullshit.
[226:51.02]Happy hour at Chuck E. Cheese.
[227:00.55]What happy hour at Chuck E. Cheese would be they put two or three extra skeeballs in the skeeball machine.
[227:06.40]That's what that would be.
[227:18.63]Can I download this yet?
[227:19.65]Alright, it's at 16%.
[227:22.43]Alright, alright.
[227:23.13]All power to download.
[227:34.72]I lost the signal.
[227:36.74]No, turn power off.
[227:37.54]I need to recharge.
[227:45.74]I'm a small hands.
[227:49.15]I just like a small phone.
[227:50.27]They're just too big.
[227:52.05]Guys, I use my phone to make phone calls and check Twitter.
[227:58.18]I don't need a big movie screen.
[228:02.48]I don't need three super high pixel HD cameras.
[228:07.73]I don't care.
[228:08.33]I just want a telephone.
[228:21.34]Have you actually played the game yet, or are you just... Yeah, I have.
[228:24.18]We found, like, three or four different signals.
[228:26.80]But I just... I'm waiting for the house to recharge.
[228:29.73]Get a landline, then.
[228:38.43]No, I'm not gonna get a landline.
[228:42.31]Turn on the generator?
[228:43.11]Yeah, I'll turn it on.
[228:44.97]No, no landlines.
[228:48.97]You can't carry a landline around.
[228:52.35]The whole point of having a little cell phone is to have a little phone that people can like contact you in your pocket.
[229:00.98]What used to be a thing that had an ability to be contactable when you left your house has turned into a movie screen.
[229:13.55]A movie camera.
[229:23.57]so they're too big when are you going to be satisfied how many iphones do they have to go through before we before we that's it like that's all we're gonna do how many g's do we have to add we're gonna go to like 10g I don't even use 4g
[229:56.31]You do?
[229:56.85]No, but like, do you though?
[230:00.39]How fast do you need to load your Twitter feed?
[230:13.08]3G Andy.
[230:17.24]Here comes the actual boomer moment.
[230:21.41]Yeah, but like, at what point do we need faster internet for our phones?
[230:36.22]We're streaming.
[230:39.34]We need it now.
[230:42.92]How many do we need?
[230:44.88]I don't know.
[230:45.96]I can call somebody and talk to them just fine.
[230:48.80]I can like tweet out a photo of me giving like the thumbs up at my favorite restaurant.
[230:54.17]And that just goes up like in one second.
[231:12.40]But the quality sucks.
[231:22.61]You're using like 5 gigahertz internet in your phone right now.
[231:27.11]No, in your home right now.
[231:28.35]Yeah, but I'm not walking around with my desktop and my monitor like attached to my back and in front of me.
[231:39.11]I'm not downloading like GTA 5 on my iPhone.
[231:55.95]Point is, it's getting too fast.
[231:58.87]And when eventually it's going to get too fast, well, they're going to start thinking.
[232:01.51]They're going to start making problems.
[232:04.70]They're going to realize that like our spleens don't need to exist.
[232:10.16]iPhone, iPhone, like 50 with like 25 G is going to be able to understand.
[232:15.88]Uh, I can, I can make that spleen better.
[232:19.48]They don't need that spleen.
[232:20.46]What's it in there for?
[232:21.19]I'm so fucking fast.
[232:38.10]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[232:40.04]Alright, I'm done.
[232:44.00]I was gonna keep going, but I don't want to keep going.
[232:47.24]I need to stop that now.
[232:54.16]He knows too much.
[232:59.28]That was an Ellen tweet?
[233:10.13]Yeah, it was.
[233:10.77]It was.
[233:11.59]It was like, how far are we going to get?
[233:13.66]Are we going to get to iPhone 55?
[233:18.12]I don't know how long it's going to take before we get to iPhone 60.
[233:20.16]It was something like that, wasn't it?
[233:34.82]Okay, I have to stop.
[233:36.10]Look, this is just the shit.
[233:38.00]I'm trying to get to fucking 7% phone battery, okay?
[233:40.62]This is the shit that we have to do.
[233:41.72]I have to fill time.
[233:54.87]Joker, Ellen, what are you talking about?
[233:58.80]Ellen and the Joker are the same person.
[234:04.36]Start turning things off you aren't using.
[234:06.93]What?
[234:09.19]What do you mean turn things off that I'm not?
[234:11.23]That's how this works?
[234:22.32]Oh my god.
[234:35.30]Turn the lights off.
[234:36.00]Turn the lights off.
[234:36.58]Turn everything off in the... Turn all the lights off.
[234:44.25]Turn the stove off.
[234:44.99]Turn the... Turn all the lights off.
[234:50.23]I need to conserve energy so I can turn my iPhone on.
[234:58.58]Unplug everything.
[235:05.46]Fucking iPhones, I swear to God.
[235:07.50]Turn these lights off, wherever they go.
[235:09.48]How we doing?
[235:11.58]Okay, I want to say 8% battery.
[235:21.47]Turn the generator off.
[235:22.47]Yep.
[235:28.10]Turn off the monitors.
[235:29.00]What?
[235:29.14]What?
[235:35.10]I can't.
[235:35.44]Turn the computer off.
[235:42.71]I can't.
[235:45.97]Turn off the solar panels.
[235:47.90]One thing at a time.
[235:48.78]Turn everything off.
[236:07.88]the stream.
[236:11.90]Where's the generator?
[236:12.64]Where did I go?
[236:15.10]I can't drive this car.
[236:15.96]Turn it off.
[236:25.13]Turn it off.
[236:25.51]I'm turning off the generator right now.
[236:34.31]I can't.
[236:34.75]It's off.
[236:37.15]No, it's not.
[236:37.53]What?
[236:37.85]Turn it off.
[236:40.25]Turn the fucking generator off.
[236:53.07]Alright, that's it.
[236:53.63]Where's the door?
[237:05.73]Please use iPhones, they're infinitely more secure in private.
[237:08.23]Alright, everything's off.
[237:31.01]Nice.
[237:31.31]10% battery.
[237:35.97]Literally every computer guy can hack an iPhone.
[237:39.97]I don't know any shit about that.
[237:48.21]It rings and I answer it.
[237:54.30]Enough light in this room.
[237:56.44]Is there one in this room?
[238:12.52]The Ellen Show.
[238:13.20]Hold on.
[238:17.98]The Ellen Show.
[238:19.12]She says, 200 years in the future.
[238:22.08]Honey, have you seen my iPhone 378?
[238:23.89]I needed to pre-order my PS6.
[238:28.93]My PS6.
[238:31.71]Why would it be iPhone 378?
[238:33.13]Wait, is that implying that only one more PlayStation is coming out in 200 years?
[238:49.62]That's the joke.
[238:59.17]Fucking hilarious.
[239:04.45]New deal.
[239:05.43]No.
[239:06.01]We're gonna already do a cooking stream for one billion off the debt.
[239:12.83]Ah, think about it.
[239:17.70]It's all gonna be cloud-based.
[239:21.56]That's the theory, right?
[239:29.87]Well, that's the theory about the Stadia.
[239:32.63]Is that Google knows it's terrible.
[239:35.61]And knows it's an awful fucking system.
[239:39.19]But they're playing like the 10 to 20 year long game.
[239:49.52]So, we'll see.
[239:53.66]Turn off the antennas.
[239:59.64]Oh.
[240:09.93]You can already thread cloud infrastructure.
[240:12.41]I don't know what that means, but it sounds important.
[240:14.50]Turn everything off.
[240:27.72]It's going faster actually.
[240:34.63]Yeah, cool.
[240:42.65]Hello?
[240:45.18]New deal, new deal, new deal.
[240:48.30]Keeping the battery at zero, hold on, let me see what this person's saying.
[240:51.44]Keeping the battery at zero is bad, so your phone charges a little bit.
[240:55.53]They can endure on AC and bypass the battery.
[240:58.55]Well, I've never seen it before.
[241:10.42]Careful now, don't put the cat puke into the soup.
[241:15.99]What's the next big leap in technology?
[241:19.61]Do you guys think it's self-driving cars?
[241:21.99]Or do you think it's quantum computing?
[241:23.93]Or do you think it's something else that we don't know?
[241:25.95]What do you guys think?
[241:28.01]AI?
[241:31.67]Batteries.
[241:32.47]Hmm.
[241:36.34]VR sex.
[241:39.08]Hmm.
[241:40.32]Okay.
[241:43.52]The perfect Poggy emote.
[241:52.16]AI.
[241:52.76]It's going to be either.
[241:53.86]Well, it doesn't AI include self-driving cars in a way.
[242:04.43]Yeah.
[242:05.05]Yeah.
[242:07.61]I don't know.
[242:07.89]I don't know what it's going to be.
[242:13.17]It might be something just that comes out of nowhere.
[242:21.55]Battery.
[242:22.38]An upgrade in battery technology would be good because lithium is not good, right?
[242:26.10]And the whole thing about lithium batteries is we run everything on lithium.
[242:32.20]And that's not a good thing.
[242:35.20]How do we make better batteries?
[242:37.75]Hmm.
[242:38.85]Interesting.
[242:39.95]Better batteries, I think.
[242:48.41]Reusable paper plates.
[242:51.15]Hmm.
[242:52.50]Better batteries, I think.
[242:55.56]Play the video game.
[242:57.28]I am.
[243:14.00]For the people that are just like, why is he sitting here with the lights off?
[243:17.70]I'm playing the game.
[243:19.22]Solid state batteries?
[243:24.94]What was this game about?
[243:25.78]It was about finding aliens.
[243:27.42]But we found the alien.
[243:28.42]The alien flew overhead.
[243:29.90]Spoiler.
[243:31.32]I saw the alien.
[243:32.84]At least his vehicle.
[243:33.80]This guy right here.
[243:39.93]Alright, we can boot it up.
[243:40.65]... ... ... ...
[243:56.26]Open up the scanner.
[244:00.38]Joel in the chat.
[244:01.00]Joel in the chat.
[244:02.34]What's up, Joel?
[244:06.71]How far did you get in this game?
[244:08.09]Did you beat it?
[244:08.57]Did you find the alien?
[244:11.11]I couldn't.
[244:11.63]I found the alien spaceship, but I didn't find anything else.
[244:18.94]You found the alien?
[244:19.88]Oh, shit.
[244:27.81]What do you do in this game?
[244:28.51]Well, you're about to see right now.
[244:30.27]You have to scan for planets.
[244:31.53]You have to find sounds.
[244:34.06]Analyze frequencies.
[244:36.22]Upload the frequencies to the governmental database.
[244:39.80]Decipher where the alien is.
[244:42.60]And then cause an immediate conflict.
[244:46.65]And start an interplanetary war.
[244:52.33]As fast as possible.
[244:53.39]And my record so far is about 11 minutes.
[244:54.85]So...
[244:58.54]Okay, we need... Here we are.
[245:06.04]300 is the minimum, and then we got 324.
[245:11.46]Oh.
[245:13.30]Got a really itchy nose.
[245:18.78]I'm sorry.
[245:24.36]Let's go.
[245:27.87]Route that power.
[245:35.71]Poke noise.
[245:38.93]We still go... I'm sorry.
[245:39.99]I just scratched you in the eye.
[245:42.34]We're still going up in power, right?
[245:44.24]I'm still... We're still good?
[245:45.30]This is not going to start draining, is it?
[245:50.14]Perfectly balanced at 15.6.
[245:51.18]Okay, we're good.
[246:03.79]Lock the doors.
[246:08.17]Oh, who cares?
[246:08.87]I'm the only person here.
[246:11.55]A helicopter comes every day and drops off like bread, spam and eggs or something.
[246:18.14]I don't know.
[246:28.52]Aliens are going to get in.
[246:31.02]Well, they're doing a really bad job of it so far.
[246:36.60]Those doors have been open for four hours.
[246:45.57]Alright, three.
[246:46.19]What's the other one?
[246:48.27]24 and 300.
[246:49.21]Still counting up.
[246:50.35]Charge is doing good.
[246:56.52]Check the bathroom.
[246:57.16]I keep going in the bathroom.
[246:58.34]Everybody keep... Joel, people keep saying check the bathroom.
[247:01.74]Are they trying to be funny with me?
[247:04.89]Is there something funny in the bathroom?
[247:06.25]They're trying to be funny with me.
[247:11.31]Spoilers.
[247:14.58]You know, everyone was telling me to call you like two or three hours ago because I couldn't figure out how to play the game.
[247:20.60]I had a little bit of a problem.
[247:24.00]And I was like, he's probably going to be eating dinner.
[247:27.28]He could be busy.
[247:28.22]I was going to call him.
[247:41.73]Dinner at 1 a.m.
[247:48.22]It took him two hours to do the tutorial.
[247:50.00]No, it took me two hours to figure out how to play the game.
[247:52.66]And then it took me about 40 minutes to do the tutorial.
[247:57.79]Alright, hold on.
[248:03.53]I gotta pay attention.
[248:04.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[248:06.45]This has got to get to 3.06.
[248:07.27]It's going to be coming up here soon.
[248:11.75]Very soon.
[248:12.35]Omega lull flees.
[248:19.76]Wait, what did he say?
[248:22.18]I missed it.
[248:23.28]You think I know, dude?
[248:24.16]I've played this game forever and I forget all the time.
[248:26.70]All I know is there's a funny alien with a green booger for a dong and he's out of his spaceship.
[248:45.79]I guess that's all there is to know, right?
[248:57.71]Well, maybe I'll find him.
[248:58.96]Probably not, though.
[248:59.90]I'm going to be honest.
[249:06.42]A green booger.
[249:09.42]Are we doing?
[249:11.48]Again, a ton of errors.
[249:20.19]Please don't ever play this game again.
[249:23.67]Um, why not?
[249:32.24]What other color boogers are there?
[249:34.60]Well, depends.
[249:36.74]It could be green, like yellow.
[249:40.98]Bloody?
[249:41.70]Like brown?
[249:42.29]Why am I?
[249:42.63]Who cares?
[249:43.01]Why are we talking about this?
[249:44.07]There's no reason to talk about this.
[249:52.23]Of course there's other colors for boogers.
[249:55.17]You should know.
[249:55.67]You just picked one out and ate it.
[250:02.56]Losing power.
[250:03.40]Losing power.
[250:04.02]Losing power.
[250:04.54]Losing power.
[250:06.20]I'm draining power right now.
[250:07.62]It's night time.
[250:08.08]Shit.
[250:08.18]Shit.
[250:10.49]I'm not even going to get this frequency.
[250:11.91]Why do I have to be so far away?
[250:13.29]About 300?
[250:13.47]What the fuck was that?
[250:20.06]What was that?
[250:21.16]What was that?
[250:22.18]What was that?
[250:22.56]Whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[250:23.70]Everything stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop everything.
[250:27.14]What was that?
[250:34.21]Where was that?
[251:08.44]Was that the video feed for the coordinates I was passing?
[251:11.73]Or is he like in the house?
[251:12.93]He's in the house.
[251:24.95]But where?
[251:25.59]In the bedroom?
[251:37.62]Find him.
[251:41.50]Laugh my ass off.
[251:42.26]He's just running in the snow.
[251:56.08]I don't see him anywhere.
[251:56.86]He's not here.
[251:57.28]Wait, there's like green ectoplasm on this.
[252:05.41]Hold on a second.
[252:08.33]Did he like raid my fridge?
[252:16.94]What did he do to my fridge?
[252:30.62]Pissed in the fridge.
[252:40.57]He peed on the fridge.
[252:46.48]Where is this little guy?
[252:47.34]I would love if he was in the computer chair.
[252:53.67]Alright, let's see.
[252:55.99]Let's find him.
[252:57.43]Get that video feedback on.
[253:04.40]0%.
[253:04.54]How did I sleep from night to night?
[253:12.24]It's just night time again.
[253:30.78]You were abducted.
[253:31.52]You lost 12 hours.
[253:33.26]Oh.
[253:36.09]Well, I'm just going to go look around outside.
[253:45.43]The clip, the clip.
[253:46.21]Yeah, let me see.
[253:46.87]Where was he?
[253:49.65]Was he next to the refrigerator?
[253:50.71]What the fuck was that?
[254:00.37]Where was he?
[254:00.89]Yeah, I'm seeing him right here.
[254:05.10]Wait, he's peeking at me in the hallway behind me.
[254:16.74]He was right here.
[254:17.66]No, he was right here.
[254:20.09]He was right here, peeking in here.
[254:28.37]Show the clip.
[254:30.74]Alright, yeah, look.
[254:31.42]It's pretty fucked up.
[254:36.44]60 seconds late.
[254:37.80]Actually late.
[254:38.56]What?
[254:42.16]60 seconds late?
[254:44.30]What?
[254:44.92]Late.
[254:45.36]Actually late.
[254:47.04]Late but not surprised.
[254:48.10]Late.
[254:48.64]What's going on here?
[254:53.88]When I scrolled up, why is it going back to the very beginning of the stream?
[254:57.95]I scrolled up like three scrolls.
[255:01.23]Hey, give me the clip one more time.
[255:02.79]I want to show it.
[255:11.95]Those of you that missed it, we can examine it.
[255:13.71]Okay.
[255:23.89]Those of you that missed it.
[255:32.15]Fuck was that?
[255:32.65]What was that?
[255:34.45]What was that?
[255:34.83]What was that?
[255:35.17]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[255:35.97]Everything stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[255:38.15]Check it out.
[255:41.51]Check it out.
[255:45.33]Look at that.
[255:46.67]He's peeking in.
[255:49.99]That's crazy, right?
[255:52.59]Oh, dude.
[255:53.13]That's fucking crazy.
[255:57.55]Dude, that's fucking crazy, man.
[256:01.28]Nice.
[256:02.14]Alright, cool.
[256:07.60]Alright, I'm going to go outside and I'm going to just drive around.
[256:09.66]I'm going to try to run him over with a car.
[256:12.59]That's what I want to do.
[256:17.41]I'm going to find him and I'm going to run him over.
[256:30.52]I wish I could drive the truck.
[256:31.94]It's unfortunate that you can't.
[256:35.17]Like, glow in the dark?
[256:43.85]Okay, I'll find him.
[257:03.47]It's not him right there, is it?
[257:04.41]There's a little guy right there.
[257:11.70]Oh.
[257:14.38]It looked like a little guy with green eyes.
[257:16.18]It's like I got lucky, huh?
[257:32.05]Check the rock again.
[257:50.34]Bring a camera this time.
[257:57.76]Nothing on the rock.
[257:59.46]I don't see anything.
[258:07.29]If I just stand still, is this a scenario where I'm just going to get sniped if I stand here for long enough?
[258:15.23]I feel like somebody all the way up there has just got me just in the crosshair.
[258:18.76]And they're just waiting for the perfect opportunity.
[258:20.56]And it's just going to be... Boom!
[258:22.62]And I'm going to just fall down.
[258:23.74]And I'm going to die.
[258:33.95]Go to the train tracks.
[258:34.91]Where are the train tracks?
[258:37.54]Over here?
[258:45.63]Saw him.
[258:45.89]He's there.
[258:46.39]Where?
[258:46.59]Follow the tracks.
[258:49.87]Follow the tracks.
[258:50.41]I don't know.
[258:55.67]Train tracks.
[258:58.27]Left.
[259:02.94]Right.
[259:03.46]Stop.
[259:13.54]Okay.
[259:13.78]Train tracks.
[259:15.94]Follow the tracks.
[259:24.40]Oh, what am I going to eat?
[259:26.58]I'm hungry.
[259:27.00]Let's try order.
[259:27.86]What do you think?
[259:34.23]Uh, there's nothing on the tracks.
[259:40.43]Is it a McDonald's kind of night?
[259:45.56]No, I had Burger King two days ago.
[259:48.85]No.
[259:49.07]Taco Bell.
[260:16.32]Just follow the tracks.
[260:23.95]Go between antennas 10 and 12.
[260:25.13]Okay.
[260:28.29]Order from a good restaurant.
[260:29.59]That's not a bad idea.
[260:31.71]Lots of those in Las Vegas.
[260:40.08]You live in Las Vegas?
[260:40.94]Oh, yeah.
[260:41.62]I love the food in Vegas.
[260:45.04]Some of the best restaurants in the world.
[260:47.04]So much variety.
[260:48.00]So much to eat.
[260:50.97]I'll figure out something.
[260:52.15]I'm not going to order like a Big Mac.
[260:55.51]Okay, tracks.
[260:56.41]Train tracks.
[261:12.60]Fast.
[261:13.20]Going too fast.
[261:22.26]Too fast?
[261:22.90]Should I slow down?
[261:30.59]Left?
[261:32.57]What do you mean?
[261:36.55]Faster, faster, faster, faster.
[261:49.78]What am I looking for exactly?
[262:00.49]I missed it.
[262:12.72]Go.
[262:15.00]Go back.
[262:15.46]Go.
[262:15.66]Oh my God.
[262:16.82]What is that thing?
[262:23.48]What is that planet?
[262:35.31]Oh, but I missed it.
[262:35.95]Go back.
[263:05.32]I don't see anything.
[263:05.92]Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[263:28.22]There's nothing on the train tracks.
[263:36.36]What was that?
[263:37.28]Wait, what was that?
[263:37.82]What was that?
[263:38.18]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[263:39.04]There's like a weird thing on the ground over here.
[263:42.83]What's this?
[263:48.85]What's this?
[263:51.26]What is this?
[263:52.62]Why is this here?
[263:58.14]This doesn't make any sense.
[263:58.90]Why is this like this?
[264:16.29]I'm telling you, we ain't on Earth.
[264:17.78]Look it.
[264:19.40]Planet over there.
[264:20.54]Planet over there.
[264:22.24]Planet back here.
[264:23.06]You can't... And then that thing.
[264:24.66]Whatever that is.
[264:38.00]I'm sorry, but you cannot see Venus like that from the naked eye standing in your backyard.
[264:46.46]You can't.
[264:47.92]You can't do that.
[264:49.38]You cannot see that.
[264:50.50]Whatever planet that is, you cannot.
[264:57.80]You literally can't.
[264:58.48]No, you cannot.
[264:58.94]No, you can't.
[265:04.44]You literally can.
[265:05.38]No, you can't.
[265:13.80]What the fuck is that thing?
[265:18.44]It's moving.
[265:21.68]It's coming over here.
[265:23.07]It's coming this way.
[265:24.35]Whatever that is, it's moving closer.
[265:40.39]That's not a helicopter.
[265:41.68]No, it's not.
[266:03.91]Is that just where the UFO thing spawns and just waits there until you do an activation for it?
[266:11.17]Every time I do the telescope, it's gone.
[266:12.61]I'm going to keep it in frame in my eyes.
[266:35.72]If I look at it, it has to stay.
[266:52.66]Hey, guys.
[266:53.22]Chairman at A5 here.
[266:55.52]Fuck!
[266:56.14]I didn't...
[267:18.47]I see a rock.
[267:19.63]I see a rock.
[267:20.98]I see a rock.
[267:22.90]What should I do with this rock?
[267:29.32]What about over here?
[267:29.92]Dude, train tracks.
[267:33.84]I'm not driving down the train tracks again.
[267:36.05]I'm sorry.
[267:36.71]Nice.
[267:44.69]Nice.
[267:50.65]It's back.
[267:52.17]It's back.
[267:52.49]It's right there.
[267:53.75]Telescope.
[267:55.89]Telescope.
[267:56.43]Telescope.
[267:56.93]Telescope.
[268:07.66]Right there.
[268:08.02]Alright.
[268:08.26]Telescope.
[268:08.78]Where's my base?
[268:12.80]Oh, go, go, go, go, go.
[268:13.72]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[268:23.80]Right there.
[268:25.86]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[268:27.40]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[268:34.77]Wrong way.
[268:35.97]Hurry.
[268:38.91]Hurry.
[268:39.49]It's right there.
[268:40.35]I have to... That's not a helicopter.
[268:43.85]It's right there.
[268:44.53]Come on.
[269:08.34]Is that a person's face?
[269:09.56]Okay, so no.
[269:28.73]That's an Easter egg.
[269:30.99]Cool.
[269:43.48]Is it Tom Cruise?
[269:44.36]I don't think it's Tom Cruise.
[269:48.55]Why is it flying vertically like that?
[269:50.45]Shouldn't it be flying horizontal?
[269:53.49]That's the alien.
[270:07.91]Good deal.
[270:12.45]Alright.
[270:13.87]I think I might have had enough.
[270:16.09]Jeremy, you stream three times per week for six hours, and there are 168 hours in a week.
[270:20.19]With this much time on your hands, you could be literally a serial killer.
[270:23.47]For $100 million off the debt, prove that you aren't a killer by telling us what you generally do while off-stream.
[270:31.42]Um... What I genuinely do when I'm not streaming.
[270:39.14]So, I tend to, um...
[270:43.69]I take a lot of baths.
[270:46.31]Usually I take a bath for a little while.
[270:48.21]I usually... What's my routine?
[270:51.41]I get up in the morning.
[270:53.37]Somewhere between... It depends.
[270:55.43]Maybe 8 o'clock in the morning.
[270:56.59]Between 8 and like 12.
[270:57.60]Really just... It depends.
[271:02.42]Usually between like 8 and 11.
[271:03.62]8 and like 10.30.
[271:05.98]Try to.
[271:07.62]I get up.
[271:08.32]I have breakfast.
[271:11.40]I use the bathroom.
[271:12.44]I take a shower.
[271:14.77]Faith of some kind.
[271:15.97]Morning routine takes a while.
[271:18.94]It usually takes me about one to two hours to be ready for the day.
[271:22.70]So after somewhere around 12 to 1 p.m., I'm ready for the day.
[271:27.26]Why does it take you that- that's your psycho?
[271:31.76]Why?
[271:34.15]That's what a killer does.
[271:35.33]They take two hours to get ready for the day.
[271:42.71]What?
[271:42.89]What?
[271:45.58]I get up.
[271:46.12]I use the bathroom.
[271:47.34]Okay, let's break up.
[271:48.38]Let's break down the exact time that this would take.
[271:52.25]You roll over.
[271:53.33]Your alarm goes off.
[271:54.23]It's 9 a.m.
[271:55.81]Okay, 9 a.m.
[271:57.93]I get out of bed.
[272:00.33]Stumble into the bathroom.
[272:01.71]Immediate full 50 to 60 second piss.
[272:04.55]That's a minute.
[272:05.87]Now we're at 9 a.m.
[272:08.42]I walk into the kitchen.
[272:12.90]I get something to eat.
[272:13.98]Okay, this takes about maybe 25 minutes until I get things prepared and eat.
[272:18.60]9.30.
[272:20.66]Now, at 9.30, it's time to turn the shower on.
[272:27.09]Get in the shower.
[272:28.25]10 to 15 minutes go by.
[272:29.31]Maybe like 10 minutes.
[272:30.97]Now you're at 9.40, 9.45.
[272:31.37]Okay.
[272:36.09]Get out of the shower.
[272:37.49]Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat my face.
[272:39.35]Do a little skin routine.
[272:40.93]Now we're talking 10 a.m.
[272:42.01]Or 9 a.m.
[272:42.63]Yeah, 10 a.m.
[272:47.74]At this time, maybe 10 to 15 minutes later, I acclimate a little bit.
[272:52.22]I sit around.
[272:53.88]I've got to go to the bathroom.
[272:55.30]I've got to take a dump, okay?
[272:57.64]Whatever.
[272:57.90]I don't care if you hear it.
[273:00.71]10, 20, 30, 40 minutes, depending on the day.
[273:03.99]Now we're at like 10.30.
[273:06.41]10.15, 10.30.
[273:06.53]I get up.
[273:12.24]It's now like 11.
[273:12.80]Hold on.
[273:16.02]Like I don't go back to bed and then get up in 30 minutes.
[273:23.18]So, I... My name is Jeremy.
[273:27.03]What are you doing?
[273:27.65]Oh, stop.
[273:28.85]Stop.
[273:29.93]Around 11 a.m., rather than the 12, I'm ready for the day.
[273:33.43]Depending on how long that takes.
[273:35.85]I have errands to do.
[273:37.72]I have stuff to do.
[273:39.64]I have to take care of my place.
[273:41.74]Do I have to clean something?
[273:42.72]Do I have to do dishes or do laundry?
[273:45.60]I mean, this stuff takes a few hours.
[273:50.04]I've got to take care of things.
[273:52.72]I've got to clean stuff up.
[273:57.30]By this point, I'm ready for lunch.
[274:00.50]That takes like an hour.
[274:03.55]So errands.
[274:04.81]Daily errands.
[274:07.99]Somewhere around like 4, 3 or 4 o'clock.
[274:12.71]I will, um... Yeah, I, uh... At 4 p.m.

[274:35.10]I feed Otto.
[274:35.88]Otto goes out.
[274:37.82]Me and Otto spend time together for at least an hour.
[274:43.32]Once I get to 5 p.m., what do I do?
