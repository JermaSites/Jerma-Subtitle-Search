[00:01.45]Okay, so we're going to move on.
[00:05.93]My nose is getting stuffed up.
[00:07.01]God damn it.
[00:09.05]You hear all this shit?
[00:11.02]What do we got?
[00:12.38]What is this?
[00:13.66]I don't know what this is.
[00:14.50]What is this?
[00:16.00]Okay, I'm going to try this.
[00:17.40]There's a cat in here now.
[00:19.68]Cat, get out of here.
[00:21.04]Why are you in here?
[00:24.38]No, don't scratch on my thing, please.
[00:28.05]Don't do that.
[00:30.21]Don't do that, please.
[00:34.55]I don't even know what this game is.
[00:43.19]Cat.
[00:44.51]It's not auto, it's a cat.
[00:47.69]Show cat.
[00:48.83]I can't.
[00:49.19]My webcam's not plugged in.
[00:54.34]Get out of here.
[00:55.46]Hey!
[00:57.00]Don't just like scratch at things.
[01:04.23]Garfield cam?
[01:05.57]No.
[01:08.77]Alright, let's go.
[01:10.81]Is this game on Twitch?
[01:17.72]I think this... Hey.
[01:18.84]Hold on.
[01:22.73]Okay, get out of here.
[01:26.89]You're like walking over the piano.
[01:28.33]Okay.
[01:30.73]She's gone.
[01:36.84]I just had a cat walk over my piano.
[01:39.20]You know what I'm talking about?
[01:43.12]Let's turn this.
[01:43.98]There we go.
[01:48.48]This is one of those games I believe is one of the worst games ever made.
[01:53.40]So, good luck.
[01:56.68]Thank you Witch Fever and Spritech for the bits.
[02:00.15]Please stop this fucking dick shot joke.
[02:02.03]I was showing you to my friend and telling him how funny you are, but now he thinks you're just one of those dime-a-dozen Let's Players.
[02:11.51]Look, if he's still watching, can I address him personally?
[02:15.70]Let me address him personally.
[02:18.96]John, we're not like that around here.
[02:22.72]We play games, we have a little fun sometimes, but we're not like that around here, John.
[02:29.22]OK, I pride myself on intellectual comedy.
[02:34.26]I try to.
[02:37.02]And sometimes there's a ball shot.
[02:40.58]And it is a dime a dozen.
[02:41.80]It is.
[02:42.50]And, you know, actually, I apologize for that.
[02:44.70]I'm ashamed of that.
[02:47.31]John.
[02:49.35]I'm ashamed of it.
[02:53.19]I do it because it gets the clicks, goddammit.
[02:55.63]I do it for the views.
[02:56.53]I do it because it gets fucking views.
[02:58.85]I upload four times a day.
[03:00.23]And I shoot people in the dick all day.
[03:02.93]I do it because I need to get the views, goddammit.
[03:07.80]I upload seven times a day.
[03:11.34]John.
[03:12.56]If you're still listening.
[03:20.36]Who the fuck is John?
[03:21.06]I don't know.
[03:27.03]No, I'm not a dime-a-dozen Let's Player.
[03:29.47]I'm not a Let's Player.
[03:38.57]I did it.
[03:39.19]I did it.
[03:40.49]I did it for the views, okay?
[03:44.96]No, I'm not plugging my webcam.
[03:45.84]No, no way.
[03:46.62]No webcam.
[03:47.18]Not a chance.
[03:52.96]When was the last game I completed besides...
[03:56.47]I'm not sure.
[03:56.91]Red Dead Redemption, maybe?
[04:01.27]Who are you?
[04:01.75]I don't know.
[04:06.24]Fucking Let's Player.
[04:08.76]The thing is, though, like, here's the thing.
[04:11.12]And now we have to... Are we really going to sit here to install this fucking game again?
[04:17.28]Oh, my God.
[04:18.18]Do I... I got to put something on the screen here.
[04:21.67]Hold on.
[04:31.57]Like, what do I put on the screen here?
[04:34.53]Like C-SPAN?
[04:38.61]Jesus Christ.
[04:42.51]Garfield?
[04:46.49]Why is this taking so long?
[04:47.51]This game is trash.
[04:53.19]Do you hear this?
[04:55.91]It's just stuck at 12%.
[05:03.34]Holy shit, PlayStation.
[05:04.72]And it's stuck.
[05:07.18]You hear that?
[05:07.58]It's stuck.
[05:08.12]And I gotta work.
[05:12.46]What a dime a dozen, Let's Player.
[05:17.43]My favorite Let's Player.
[05:20.59]13%.
[05:20.61]We finally got a percentage.
[05:27.85]Holy shit, guys.
[05:34.61]If this doesn't speed up in about five seconds, we're putting another game in.
[05:45.10]Garfield versus John.
[05:48.74]I might just pull this out.
[05:50.20]This is going to take way too long.
[05:56.33]Show us a Let's Play.
[05:57.07]I don't have any Let's Plays.
[05:59.45]I started a Witcher 2 Let's Play like seven years ago and did one episode.
[06:05.56]Let's watch a YouTube video.
[06:09.26]How about like a funny cat compilation?
[06:13.14]How do you guys feel about that?
[06:14.16]Okay, how about this one?
[06:22.27]Cats are so funny you will die laughing.
[06:24.57]Funny cat compilation.
[06:27.01]Or this one.
[06:27.43]Cats will make you laugh your head off.
[06:31.13]This one has 53 million views.
[06:32.79]What do you think?
[06:36.25]Should we give it a shot?
[06:41.40]I want to die.
[06:42.46]Jesus Christ.
[06:54.91]Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[06:55.91]No funny cats.
[06:56.99]How about... Let's go...
[07:05.53]I'm going to type in review.

[08:15.85]Triple cheeseburger.
[08:16.79]I'm doing the new beefy triple cheeseburger from...
[08:21.09]McDonald's.
[08:22.25]That's right.
[08:22.69]It's off the McPick 2 for 5 menu.
[08:26.53]And it's $2.59.

[08:29.62]Okay, YouTube.

[08:37.43]I can't even get the ad.
[08:38.93]Ten random Steam keys.
[08:41.89]I can't exit the ad.
[08:59.57]for a triple cheeseburger, the beefy triple cheeseburger.
[09:03.89]And so you saw that.

[09:12.09]You get nuggets, whatever your little heart desires.
[09:15.59]And they're offering that today at Mickey D's or better known as McDonald's.
[09:21.32]So we're gonna give this a shot.
[09:23.82]Price point's very good.
[09:25.48]You know, you got three patties here.
[09:27.38]It looks great.
[09:28.16]Got the American-
[09:30.24]I don't care.
[09:31.54]That was a pretty good video.
[09:33.24]Alright, what about 23%?
[09:37.02]Get the fuck out of here.
[09:37.96]I'm not sitting here for two hours.
[09:46.63]Why is this taking this long?
[09:49.61]Is this this much data in this game?
[09:56.80]Don't make me put this in.
[10:03.60]17 minutes are left.
[10:06.62]Jesus Christ.
[10:09.22]What the fuck are we doing?
[10:11.20]How about... News bloopers.
[10:17.81]No, no, fuck that.
[10:19.81]Absolutely not.
[10:21.01]Absolutely no.
[10:28.66]Play Rat Movie?
[10:29.58]Why would you want Rat Movie?
[10:33.29]You want me to watch a rat movie on stream?
[10:39.75]Why?
[10:41.13]I've already seen that movie like five times.
[10:51.98]Hold on, I got a better idea.
[10:55.41]Give me a second.
[10:57.09]You guys don't think I have a better idea?
[10:59.37]Check this shit out.
[11:01.58]Hope you guys are ready for this.
[11:02.87]I was fucking prepared for a situation like this.
[11:07.85]You don't think that I was fucking prepared for this?
[11:14.59]Why can I not open Pizza Connection 3?
[11:19.25]What the fuck are you talking about?
[11:20.87]Play the game.
[11:21.91]I can't open Pizza Connection 3 Pizza Creator.
[11:24.12]Why?
[11:26.26]What the fuck happened?

[11:54.15]Wait a minute.
[11:54.73]Okay, I am, I'm actually really, really intrigued about this.
[11:58.39]I downloaded Pizza Connection 3 like three weeks ago.
[12:03.89]Now you're telling me that this game's not available till 2018.
[12:07.86]What?
[12:14.02]I already downloaded it.
[12:15.68]It just wouldn't run.
[12:17.56]Oh my fucking god.
[12:22.12]Fine.
[12:23.98]You don't think I'm prepared?
[12:27.07]Everybody thinks I'm like not prepared for this stream.
[12:29.78]That's fine.
[12:32.72]We'll see how you feel about that in about 10 seconds.
[12:41.83]That's fine.
[12:52.47]Didn't think I'm fucking prepared for this shit.
[13:05.35]This is so loud.
[13:09.12]Okay, let's go.
[13:12.54]What is this?
[13:13.36]Go.
[13:14.58]How do I swim?
[13:15.22]Go.
[13:16.24]Start the game.
[13:18.20]I think it crashed.
[13:21.70]I can't see the chat, by the way.
[13:23.14]I hope you guys can see this.
[13:26.98]Is this person naked?

[14:58.22]How about this one?
[15:06.32]Oh shit, it's gonna be loud.
[15:07.60]No, it's not.
[15:08.02]I'm good.
[15:14.76]Let's make sure we get this right.
[15:19.94]How's that?
[15:20.28]Does that work?
[15:21.92]Can you see it?
[15:23.86]Can you guys see?
[15:25.48]You guys can see that, right?
[15:26.64]Okay, cool.

[16:13.73]Leave this fucking guy.
[16:34.13]Why are they talking through a voice changer?
[16:37.37]Apologize.
[16:38.53]Okay, sorry.

[17:27.80]Okay, wait, what?
[17:32.42]Escape!
[17:38.92]He's gonna burn.
[17:39.54]He's gonna burn to death.
[17:43.78]I feel like this is a VR game and I'm not doing this correctly.
[17:53.86]What is he talking about?
[17:58.95]What's the context for anything that's happening?
[18:05.79]Alright, shove him to the monsters.
[18:08.17]Get rid of this guy.
[18:11.12]The glass broke.
[18:23.40]I... I should get to the escape pod.
[18:28.05]I should get to the escape pod.
[18:32.37]Okay.

[18:36.03]Level complete.
[18:39.57]What the fuck is going on?
[18:47.18]What am I doing here?
[18:49.16]That's me?
[18:50.12]How is this me?
[18:51.84]What?
[18:54.90]I don't understand this.
[18:56.58]I'm shooting the fucking proton gun?
[19:04.81]I think so.
[19:05.65]Yeah, I am.
[19:24.34]Okay.
[19:27.02]We're at 68%.
[19:27.32]Getting there.
[19:29.72]Are you guys ready for this?
[19:39.83]I don't know if you're ready for this.
[19:44.73]This is just funny because I think it's funny, okay?
[19:47.40]If you don't think it's funny, I don't even care.
[19:52.10]I don't care.
[20:01.35]I can't even see the chat.
[20:02.17]I don't even know what you guys are saying.
[20:03.81]I'm ready.
[20:04.39]I'm ready.
[20:07.39]Fucking butthole productions.
[20:08.79]What a fucking funny let's player.
[20:10.17]Alright, let's do it.
[20:18.50]Let's win.
[20:19.96]I'm going to win a game of PUBG on stream right now.
[20:39.35]I've never seen anyone stream this before.
[20:43.25]He actually went to PUBG.
[20:45.11]My favorite PlayStation 3 game.
[20:48.28]Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[20:49.80]Let's make this not misleading.
[20:54.74]Just so people understand, you know what I mean?
[20:57.98]Just so you understand...
[21:00.94]This is the face cam.
[21:02.18]I gotta get the face cam on, right?
[21:03.80]Fuck.
[21:04.06]Hold on.
[21:05.32]No, I can't.
[21:05.74]It's gonna crash the game.
[21:06.36]It's gonna crash everything.
[21:11.96]There.
[21:12.22]That's better.
[21:18.83]Like, this is your face cam.
[21:20.57]It's a game of PUBG.
[21:23.01]I forget how to play the game.
[21:26.33]I'm gonna go to school.
[21:28.05]I guess.
[21:35.21]School.
[21:37.29]Right?
[21:41.55]Shouldn't this be the other way around?
[21:43.79]Fuck, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[21:45.61]You know, when you're right, you're right.
[21:52.40]There.
[21:53.16]Better.
[21:54.10]Fixed it.
[21:55.42]School, right?
[21:56.02]Fuck!
[21:56.46]School!
[21:59.76]Oh, shit.
[22:00.54]I'm not at the school.
[22:01.64]I can get to the school.
[22:03.62]I can get there from here.
[22:09.78]I'll get there.
[22:19.48]You know, this might be a mistake, but I don't care.
[22:29.89]Almost there.
[22:32.23]Let's go.
[22:32.67]Get down there.
[22:33.11]Come on.
[22:37.23]What do we got?
[22:40.12]Nobody's going there.
[22:41.70]I think I'm the only person going to school.
[22:44.74]Perfect.
[22:50.30]Here we go.
[22:50.67]Let's move.
[22:58.81]You know, you guys, this is already in the top 89.
[23:01.25]I didn't even, I didn't do anything.
[23:06.72]And I'm already in the top fucking 87. 87.
[23:10.05]And we're gonna run in a straight line to the school.
[23:17.70]Here we go.
[23:20.06]Think I'm fucking around in this game?
[23:22.02]No, I'm not.
[23:33.59]You think this is a fucking joke?
[23:43.15]I got it.
[23:56.34]I'll beat this.
[23:56.78]I'll strangle this guy with my fucking bare hands.
[24:00.04]He's upstairs.
[24:02.58]Gun.
[24:07.83]Neither guy give a fuck.
[24:09.19]Bare hands.
[24:11.15]Bare hands wrapped around a gun.
[24:22.21]Where is he?
[24:26.17]High quality smoke, if you ask me.
[24:35.26]How is it nobody here?
[24:38.70]The whole reason why I wanted to do this is ruined.
[24:45.16]What the?
[24:45.60]Now what do I do?
[24:46.94]Oh, god damn it.
[24:48.82]Now I have to play PUBG.
[24:52.15]I was hoping for, like, a shootout and I would die and I could go back to this and be done.
[24:55.89]Oh, no.
[24:58.39]Oh, god damn it.
[25:02.26]I don't want to play the game.
[25:03.40]I don't want to play PUBG.
[25:07.54]Oh, what?
[25:08.14]No, I don't... What the fuck?
[25:15.45]I have to, like, play the game.
[25:19.88]This is supposed to be like a 30 second joke and it's turned into like a full round of PUBG.
[25:29.28]I got an Uzi now.
[25:30.32]God damn it.
[25:32.54]I don't... Okay, here we go.
[25:37.55]78%.
[25:40.41]Let's make ourselves really fucking known that we're coming, you know what I mean?
[25:53.46]Watch me win this round.
[25:56.32]No, I won't win.
[25:57.38]Where is he?
[26:07.43]Okay.
[26:08.13]I want to play what I was doing earlier.
[26:10.13]I want to play PlayStation.
[26:11.63]I want to play PlayStation 3.
[26:13.85]Get out of here.
[26:14.45]Fucking exit.
[26:19.85]Oh, my God.
[26:20.51]Why is it taking this long?
[26:24.96]Why wasn't nobody at the school?
[26:31.08]I'm not giving up.
[26:34.10]Just wait.
[26:36.50]Just fucking wait, everybody.
[26:45.87]Oh god, what happened?
[26:48.11]Oh my god, it's my- oh no.
[26:50.27]Oh no.
[26:52.35]Why is it an 800x600?
[26:54.26]What are you doing, Mountain Blade?
[26:57.14]What are you thinking?
[26:58.66]Bink video player.
[26:59.68]What the fuck are you doing?
[27:05.29]Mountain Blade Warband is loading up in the background right now.
[27:07.99]And it's opening at like 800x600 for some reason.
[27:09.75]Holy shit.
[27:27.22]No, God!
[27:28.72]No, I didn't want to start his video.
[27:32.04]I didn't want to start the fucking video.
[27:38.55]He's gone.
[27:41.45]Okay.
[27:45.45]Why is it taking this time?
[27:47.15]It's loading.
[27:47.99]Warband is taking as long to load as this game.
[27:56.42]Oh my god, I'm breaking my fucking... Could not reset the D3D device.
[28:00.26]It broke.
[28:05.42]Sorry, guys.
[28:06.52]No warband.
[28:08.67]I tried.
[28:08.97]Okay, let's go with... What else do I have installed?
[28:19.30]What else do I have installed? 88%.
[28:31.20]I like my Jerma streams like a fucking train wreck.
[28:35.82]I love you dearly, but you suck.
[28:37.34]I'm just fucking around.
[28:38.22]I'm doing dumb shit to wait for the loading screen.
[28:43.51]Which, by the way, I can't believe is still taking this long.
[28:47.83]That's so fucking funny.
[28:49.67]Alright, well, that's it.
[28:50.49]I'm just gonna sit here.
[28:52.81]I'm gonna put random images on the fucking screen.
[28:58.58]Alright, if somebody can guess what the fucking random image that's going to appear on the stream is, I will scream as loud as I can.
[29:10.77]I will scream as loud as I possibly can and wake up my neighbors.
[29:16.27]If you guys can tell, if you can tell me what image you're going to put on the screen right now.
[29:23.73]I don't see it.
[29:24.29]Nope.
[29:25.94]Nope.
[29:32.04]Nope.
[29:32.38]Nobody's got it.
[29:40.16]Nope.
[29:41.52]Sorry.
[29:41.84]I don't see it.
[29:45.29]I don't need to scream.
[29:47.33]Mm-hmm.
[29:54.45]Go ahead.
[29:54.65]Keep going.
[29:58.49]Mm-hmm.
[30:04.62]Nope.
[30:05.04]Sorry.
[30:05.52]None of you said Mount Rushmore.
[30:06.87]Sorry.
[30:09.25]Don't need to scream.
[30:13.05]None of you said it.
[30:16.54]Thanks for playing.
[30:34.24]I did say that I said I said presidents no you didn't say mount rushmore you said that twice though you didn't ah okay now we're done 95 come on you said rushmore you didn't say mount rushmore sorry
[31:05.39]This game's not going to be worth waiting for, by the way.
[31:07.75]Just in case anyone's curious.
[31:09.93]Not even fucking close.
[31:13.64]This is fucking stupid.
[31:15.14]This is the longest we fucking waited for a game to install.
[31:19.72]And it's going to be the worst one we've ever played.
[31:22.12]Just throwing that out there.
[31:24.06]Warning, this game has violence in it.
[31:26.52]Okay.
[31:34.25]Iguana Interactive.
[31:37.07]Let's go.
[31:41.93]Cartoon without the C. Sure.
[31:45.18]Why is there no audio?
[31:47.24]I almost just exited OBS.
[31:50.46]Do not exit OBS.
[31:53.30]Holy fuck.
[31:54.68]Okay.
[32:01.36]Opening cutscene.
[32:13.73]Am I a vampire?
[32:14.55]Is that how this works?
[32:26.20]Remember, we waited like 30 minutes for this to install.
[32:31.62]Why did I do this to you guys?
[32:33.04]I don't know.
[32:40.70]Change the game.
[32:42.14]Should be change over.
[32:46.72]Yeah, it's changed.
[32:47.64]It's there.
[32:56.40]I already don't like this.
[32:57.34]I'm already not having any fun.
[33:11.25]I'm just going over and over again in my head how long we waited for this.
[33:15.69]It better have been worth it.
[33:21.00]It wasn't.
[33:21.58]New splash.
[33:26.20]This is a painfully long opening cutscene.
[33:30.27]And it's not even long.
[33:40.97]I had to do that.
[33:41.61]I skipped it.
[33:42.23]I had to.
[33:46.35]AQ Interactive published by Ignition.
[33:50.91]Save data, sure.
[33:52.23]Creating save data, sure.
[33:53.21]How is the game not PUBG?
[34:00.12]Single play online.
[34:10.03]Okay, that's fucking Solid Snake.
[34:15.25]It's very clearly Solid Snake.
[34:21.51]Metal Gear Solid.
[34:22.89]Alright, let's go.
[34:23.53]I'm ready.
[34:24.85]Room search.
[34:28.95]Sure.
[34:30.64]Okay.
[34:34.72]Huh.
[34:36.64]What a surprise.
[34:43.54]No, what are you talking about?
[34:44.98]Go to single play.
[34:48.74]Can you imagine if there was like a bunch of people playing right now?
[34:50.78]That'd be so funny.
[34:51.68]Rain 1, Tutorial 1.
[34:53.32]God damn it.
[34:54.08]No, no tutorial.
[34:57.18]I'm done with it.
[35:00.51]East France, 1430 AD.
[35:20.12]So she's so she's a vampire.
[35:21.30]She can't be in the sunlight, but she is.
[35:25.20]It's been 800 years since I last met a vampire created by nature, not a bite.
[35:33.69]Do not fear me.
[35:35.69]I am like you, a natural vampire.
[35:38.57]What is your name, child?
[35:40.47]Oh, God.
[35:40.91]Are you OK?
[35:53.22]Anduin.
[35:55.50]Anduin Wren.
[35:56.78]Colonel Dixon.
[35:58.44]Of course his name is Dixon.
[36:00.81]What a let's play joke.
[36:04.21]They report that everything is set for the extermination team.
[36:08.09]Where's the extermination team right now?
[36:10.89]Approaching E9 at this very moment, sir.
[36:13.28]Their ETA is 2130.
[36:15.80]What about the weather in the area?
[36:17.32]Still raining, sir.
[36:18.42]Showers are expected to continue until tomorrow morning.
[36:20.72]Why does he care about the weather?
[36:21.56]I'm giving the extermination team the go-ahead.
[36:24.02]Who cares about the weather?
[36:25.14]Sir, is the Nightwalker population really expected to exceed that of humans in 908 days?
[36:30.03]Yes.
[36:31.63]Where did you hear that?
[36:33.51]One of the lab boys, sir.
[36:34.99]He also said that if the growth went unchecked... Funny you mentioned God Hand.
[36:38.27]I have God Hand.
[36:40.53]That's another one of the games we have.
[36:41.39]That's what happens when you let pencil pushers run a country.
[36:44.75]They did absolutely nothing, while Nightwalkers claimed victims every night.
[36:50.31]He is wearing an Xbox 360 headset.
[36:59.06]People in the Secret Service don't wear those.
[37:02.34]Why do they put these in games?
[37:04.23]Nobody wears those.
[37:06.62]They never did.
[37:06.96]They yelled to each other across the room.
[37:08.36]I tried to skip it, but... Somebody's trying to shoot him.
[37:10.04]I don't know.
[37:10.42]Minority report thing.
[37:10.96]Never mind.
[37:31.14]Here we are.
[37:31.60]Point E-9.
[37:33.50]Here we are.
[37:34.70]Deft, you're waiting.
[37:36.56]No unknown contacts in the immediate vicinity.
[37:38.30]No unknown contacts in the immediate vicinity.
[37:40.10]Commence the operations.
[37:41.12]Commence the operations.
[37:42.52]Okay, listen up.
[37:44.08]As you've been briefed, we're here to exterminate a Prime Walker.
[37:47.39]Yes, we are.
[37:47.75]Taking out the target will destroy every Nightwalker spawned from the Prime.
[37:51.53]Holy shit, son of a bitch!
[37:54.27]Fifty fuckin' ducks!
[37:55.99]Thank you, Lambland, for the six, six, six.
[37:58.01]I'm a fucking idiot.
[38:02.15]Thank you lamb lamb 666 for the $50.
[38:07.01]Here's their message.
[38:07.85]Because who fucking cares about anything you see on screen?
[38:12.34]When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band.
[38:15.26]He said, son, when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?
[38:22.33]He said, will you defeat them and your demons and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
[38:27.62]Because one day I'll leave you a phantom to lead you in summer to join... What is that?
[38:32.90]What is it?
[38:33.14]What is it?
[38:33.50]What is it?
[38:33.92]What is that?
[38:35.42]What is that?
[38:36.66]What is that?
[38:37.12]Yes, sir.
[38:47.39]You're on a first-name basis with the leader of the advance team?
[38:50.11]The lyrics to a song.
[38:51.59]Yeah, we go back a few wars.
[38:54.23]Afghanistan, Kosovo, Baghdad.
[38:58.04]It's nice to have someone you can trust to watch your back.
[39:01.24]Captain?
[39:02.52]Yeah?
[39:03.32]I can't get a response from the advance team.
[39:04.92]Well, thanks for the $50.
[39:05.98]Try transmitting across all channels.
[39:07.62]I've already done that, sir.
[39:08.69]They're not responding.
[39:10.95]Keep trying, Hanson.
[39:12.43]Looks like we're gonna be here a while.
[39:15.77]Solid Jerma.
[39:16.05]Am I 60 years old?
[39:16.63]I mean, I don't know.
[39:17.23]Have I?
[39:18.31]I'm like fucking 40.
[39:18.95]I'm 40.
[39:44.47]Please skip the cutscene.
[39:55.72]Am I over the hill?
[39:56.56]No, you're not over the hill until you're 40.
[40:06.71]Please, let's just press this.
[40:07.61]We spent like fucking... We spent like 30 minutes waiting for this.
[40:17.11]captain yeah handsome what's up I just got confirmation from handsome they want you to head to the rendezvous point secured by the advance team as planned I kind of figured they'd say that I skipped it I'm sorry I I just I skipped it twice rendezvous point how many times do you have to skip the cutting before we're done okay this is like siphon filter it's so dark I can't even see
[40:46.16]This was not worth 30 minutes.
[40:47.88]I already know that for a second.
[40:48.84]And we got another cutscene.
[40:49.60]Skip it.
[40:49.98]I don't want to see it.
[40:51.00]We're done.
[40:51.26]I love this.
[40:59.72]Top left.
[40:59.90]Life.
[41:11.73]Holy shit.
[41:12.79]Why did we spend this much time getting this game installed?
[41:18.32]Just go.
[41:18.98]Just go.
[41:20.02]I don't need to do anything.
[41:21.86]Just go.
[41:25.30]What's wrong?
[41:31.01]Look for yourself.
[41:32.55]It's like Splinter Cell.
[41:34.29]I know it is.
[41:34.97]It's just not good.
[41:37.17]We're back to L1.
[41:41.13]Another cutscene.
[41:41.99]Sure.
[41:42.55]Okay.
[41:43.03]It even has the call thing on.
[41:49.01]I can't go this far.
[41:50.92]He's doing the same thing I am.
[41:52.46]Okay.
[41:52.68]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[42:21.28]Oh, no.
[42:25.26]I think it skipped a bunch of shit.
[42:28.70]Because I was just incompetent, so it just skipped the whole thing.
[42:31.55]That's fine.
[42:32.03]Good.
[42:40.01]I've got, like, a kingpin.
[42:52.17]Why do you need a cutscene for that?
[42:53.81]Go.
[42:58.74]What is this game?
[43:03.34]I almost just killed myself.
[43:09.39]Haven't you guys felt like we've done the same corridor like three times now?
[43:15.51]Hmm?
[43:17.73]Oh, please.
[43:18.83]Go on.
[43:19.21]Okay.
[43:20.97]Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[43:24.81]What do you want me to do?
[43:25.55]I keep... 30 minutes of time.
[43:30.87]30 minutes.
[43:32.45]Oh, my God.
[43:32.79]What do you... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[43:36.07]Use teamwork to climb... Teamwork.
[43:50.96]Ugh.
[43:58.38]I knew nothing.
[43:59.48]Time for Demon's Souls dump.
[44:01.00]That's gonna be a whole stream.
[44:02.00]We will do an entire stream on Demon's Souls.
[44:03.71]Maybe more than one.
[44:05.25]Possibly more than one.
[44:05.79]These markings.
[44:06.75]They look like the astrological symbols for the sun and the moon.
[44:30.92]Does anything happen in this game?
[44:34.78]I do have the voice, that's true.
[44:36.96]But I don't want to start singing now.
[44:40.74]You know how embarrassing that's going to be?
[44:42.27]If I start fucking singing right now?
[44:45.43]I've had like a couple of drinks.
[44:47.07]It's not worth it.
[44:48.33]No way.
[44:49.11]Like, it'll be embarrassing.
[44:50.31]You guys will be like... It'll be like cringy and shit.
[44:52.68]Like, I'm not doing that right now.
[44:57.68]It's about time.
[44:59.82]Do it.
[45:00.22]Oh, no.
[45:02.92]I can't.
[45:03.95]I can't.
[45:07.25]Like, everyone's gonna make fun of me and shit.
[45:17.23]I'll be, like, on the internet as, like, that fucking loser that, like, sang.
[45:21.34]30 minutes for this.
[45:23.70]30 minutes for this.
[45:34.65]What was I thinking?
[45:35.59]Did you forget your mission, soldier?
[45:41.88]Oh my... What do you want me to do?
[45:46.14]Hello?
[45:55.02]Huh?
[46:02.08]Ugh!
[46:10.54]There's monsters in this game.
[46:12.34]I don't know where to go.
[46:15.83]How do I open the door?
[46:16.81]Oh my goodness.
[46:30.16]Is there an open door button that I don't know?
[46:39.79]What do you want me to do?
[46:41.09]I skipped all the cutscenes.
[46:42.09]I mean, that shit's blinkin', but like, what do you want me to do?
[47:00.26]It showed me- I wasn't- I wasn't looking at the screen, I was looking at the chat.
[47:05.01]She showed me.
[47:05.83]I looked at- I wasn't looking at the screen!
[47:11.08]I was looking at you guys.
[47:24.83]This is watching that BuzzFeed review play Cuphead.
[47:27.29]That's not true!
[47:29.73]This game is fucking stupid.
[47:31.25]It's a terrible like 0 out of 10 game.
[47:33.80]And I wasn't looking at the... I was looking at the chat.
[47:53.89]Go around the corner.
[47:54.81]I'm getting yelled at.
[48:00.87]How do I die so I can just see the fucking cutscene?
[48:11.50]Fucking stupid game.
[48:16.96]Fucking zero out of ten game.
[48:27.26]Be done with it Jump grab the zip line Get it out of give me it give me it
[49:14.41]CeeDee's out!
[49:17.67]We can't load the next level.
[49:22.21]We've loaded all the assets required to play the game.
[49:33.36]CeeDee's out of the tray.
[49:35.56]Okay, like I was th- There, good, look!
[49:39.32]Cool!
[49:46.94]Go down there, please.
[49:48.40]There's no disk in the tray.
[49:55.77]What's it going to do?
[49:56.81]You can't load the next area.
[49:57.67]There's no disk.
[49:58.07]What?
[49:58.29]That doesn't make any sense.
[49:59.05]There's no disk.
[50:14.81]How is it possible that it loaded this fucking next part of the game?
[50:19.93]It's installed, but that doesn't matter.
[50:21.62]It has to pull from the CD to know it's in there, otherwise it's gonna get fucking banned.
[50:26.30]What the?
[50:28.78]Looks like a corpse.
[50:30.72]Looks like a nightwalker got him.
[50:32.90]What a lousy way to go.
[50:34.24]The game did download the whole game, that's true.
[50:36.79]We'll go on ahead.
[50:38.45]Gee, thanks.
[50:44.11]Give me something to do here before I rage end.
[50:49.03]Grab the pipe.
[50:55.15]Oh lord.
[50:59.04]Why are we still here?
[50:59.72]Just to suffer?
[51:02.16]Sing, sing, sing.
[51:03.30]I can't do that right now.
[51:04.72]You know what?
[51:05.08]It's going to be so embarrassing.
[51:12.24]There has to be a disclaimer.
[51:14.29]If I play the voice right now.
[51:16.45]That it's... I know it sucks.
[51:18.59]I know I'm a fucking... I'm a doofus.
[51:22.75]And it's a piece of shit.
[51:23.73]And I know that I'm not good at singing.
[51:26.19]But I don't want to make that joke.
[51:28.26]Like, oh, you suck at singing joke.
[51:29.96]Like, let's play.
[51:30.76]Remember that guy earlier?
[51:32.72]The guy from earlier?
[51:35.80]That was like, you're a let's player.
[51:38.02]That's let's player comedy, don't you think?
[51:43.12]Get the fucking CD.
[51:44.00]Oh, the CD's already out of here.
[51:45.18]Never mind.
[52:00.83]Yeah, you're a washed up Let's Player.
[52:02.83]Hey!
[52:04.99]Don't say that.
[52:07.59]That's not true.
[52:10.45]Play it, please.
[52:11.17]Play it.
[52:11.45]Easily distracted streamer strains to answer for his own incompetence.
[52:14.43]Hey!
[52:16.47]Hey!
[52:17.71]Easy.
[52:23.99]I think we may have, uh... Wait, hold on.
[52:26.90]Put it back in.
[52:31.22]Oh, wait!
[52:31.60]No, no, no, no!
[52:32.54]That's Neverdead.
[52:34.04]That's Neverdead.
[52:34.66]Neverdead just, that's not the right CD.
[52:37.08]Okay, we're fine.
[52:42.77]That was the wrong disk.
