[01:28.79]Back in it.
[01:29.53]Again.

[01:37.46]That actually hurt to say that.
[01:40.61]It's already set up.
[01:42.05]Apparently, I didn't know this before setting it all up.
[01:45.55]Let's get... Look at my outfit today.
[01:47.04]I'm super springy today.
[01:48.52]I'm like really summery today.

[02:17.33]I was ready to do VR.
[02:20.36]The Wave?
[02:21.50]What's this called?
[02:23.84]This is called something.
[02:28.56]The Wave shirt.
[02:29.44]No, no, no.
[02:30.00]What's the shirt called?
[02:36.69]I look like Ric Flair.

[03:10.15]Is this the right hand?
[03:11.23]Before I strap these up, let me... And also, by the way... Boring.
[03:17.80]What's it got in the wine glass?
[03:21.98]Water?
[03:23.04]Boring.
[03:26.53]I can't drink in there.
[03:27.35]I'll fucking die.
[03:29.45]Alright, let's go.
[03:32.75]I'm gonna get this over with.
[03:36.86]Somebody has given like 20 community subs with the name JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[03:43.20]You have to change your name now.
[03:45.29]This is the stream where you change your name.
[03:49.23]Y'all thought I was a liar.
[03:50.65]You thought I wasn't going to do it.
[03:52.11]Here we are.
[03:56.15]I don't really know how to play in VR though.
[03:58.72]So it should be interesting for all
[04:06.36]This is all untangled, we're all good to go.
[04:09.78]Did you see my fucking summer outfit?
[04:11.34]I didn't even get any compliments.
[04:14.55]We're already tangled, no we're not.
[04:18.99]Yeah, that's fine.
[04:20.63]Alright, going in.
[04:26.08]This shirt probably has sweat stains.
[04:30.38]It's worn to bed quite frequently.
[04:36.04]I'm going to unmute the game too, don't worry.
[04:37.78]Alright, there we go.
[04:45.70]So we are in Minecraft now.
[04:55.77]So, what was it?
[04:57.13]One hour, right?
[04:57.93]I said I'm going to play this for one hour.
[05:00.55]And then uninstall the game.
[05:01.51]I told her I was going to just dig down until I find diamonds and uninstall the game.
[05:11.26]Which one is right and which one is left?
[05:12.48]This is kind of cool.
[05:23.27]He came underwater to do this?
[05:27.03]Okay.
[05:30.66]This is actually really interesting.
[05:32.12]I don't want the full experience.
[05:33.66]Not yet.
[05:34.32]What happened down there?
[05:34.96]Alright, this is the right hand.
[05:41.53]Because the left hand has HUD info on it.
[05:44.61]See this?
[05:44.97]There you guys are.
[05:46.91]Because there's no HUD info.
[05:48.62]I know this is the right hand.
[05:51.10]You're going to drown?
[05:52.00]I'm already dead.
[05:53.56]I already died.
[05:57.96]It's weird seeing the game like this though.
[05:59.42]This is kind of strange.
[06:03.04]The blocks look huge.
[06:08.99]destroy the tree hold on so we're gonna have to get the whole tutorial here I know how to play Minecraft but it's been fucking and the last time I played it doesn't count because I was shit-faced alright here we go so how do I respawn how do you how do I spawn

[07:29.33]Okay, how do I get this tutorial out of here?
[07:30.77]I know what I'm doing.
[07:32.55]Wait, what do you do when you first start Minecraft?
[07:34.57]Um...
[07:38.08]This is, I hate this.
[07:39.16]I feel like I'm tuning a TV.
[07:50.30]Whoa, alright.

[08:12.46]How do I place blocks?
[08:13.30]Okay, it's this button here.
[08:17.12]Then you can take them away by hitting them again.
[08:18.55]Alright, so.
[08:20.85]Say the lines.
[08:22.11]Not until I know what I'm doing.
[08:23.87]Plus, that wasn't part of the deal.
[08:27.85]Oh, destroy the tree.
[08:29.09]I know.
[08:37.40]This takes too long.
[08:38.18]Where's my inventory?
[08:39.04]Right over here?
[08:40.88]Alright, so you can slide.
[08:46.62]No, actually not bad controls.

[09:06.98]Alright, I got enough wood.

[09:14.16]Just harvest some light.
[09:19.58]Press E. What's E?
[09:24.21]Oh, that's how you throw.
[09:27.91]No, that's the menu.
[09:37.99]What is E?
[09:40.59]Top left button?
[09:41.45]Yeah, that's what I just pressed.
[09:43.29]One of the grips, maybe?
[09:48.31]What is E?
[09:52.51]Just press E. I can't just, there's no E on my hand.
[09:58.54]Where'd that go?
[10:06.78]Press E.
[10:14.12]Didn't I just do it?
[10:15.92]Ah, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[10:16.86]Okay, so hold on here.
[10:17.90]It's up.
[10:19.42]You have to press up.
[10:20.16]What's down?
[10:20.60]Let's just get the buttons ready.
[10:22.30]Down is jump.
[10:24.30]What is right?
[10:24.88]Okay, everything, it's, okay, I got it.
[10:26.55]I got E. There's the crafting menu.
[10:29.89]So this is your click to open key showing off.
[10:35.09]And this is, I make, oh, this is a lot different than what I remember.
[10:37.51]Okay, so you just put it up here.
[10:43.96]And then take them.
[10:48.98]He got it.
[10:49.38]Okay.
[10:50.88]Then you do sticks and then I need to make the tool, right?
[10:59.14]That's enough tools.
[11:01.22]So crafting, I need to make a work bench.
[11:03.04]That's this, right?
[11:03.90]I don't always split them.
[11:07.90]How do you split?
[11:09.02]There it is.
[11:11.83]Crafting bench.
[11:14.89]Alright.
[11:16.67]And then... Let me just make a little shitty fucking house first.
[11:20.33]Just hold on.
[11:21.13]Get out of the menu.
[11:22.79]I gotta make a house.
[11:24.77]Right on the beach.
[11:25.37]Perfect.
[11:25.71]What do you think?
[11:43.40]Hell yeah.
[11:43.94]I'm so ready for a 24-hour stream here.
[11:45.69]It's not going to be 24 hours.
[11:49.35]Good thing you have your beach outfit on.
[11:52.61]Yeah.
[11:52.87]Alright, so I'm thinking a long dock here and then the house.
[12:00.32]I don't want to... No, actually, living on a beach is fine.
[12:02.62]I need a shovel.
[12:04.00]This is very overwhelming.
[12:06.29]So just put the fucking crafting bench down.
[12:07.91]Who cares?
[12:09.33]Not like that.
[12:09.83]Go get it.
[12:13.69]So crafting bench, let's put it over there.
[12:16.39]I'll open it up.
[12:18.73]Does this count that I'm standing near it?
[12:20.70]Okay, there it is.
[12:26.40]Let's get it all in there.
[12:27.24]I got pickaxe.
[12:30.38]Let's get a, wow.
[12:31.75]Does it actually work?
[12:33.19]Does this work?
[12:37.41]That's actually really cool.
[12:38.75]Can I actually hit stuff with this?
[12:44.35]Okay, shovel.
[12:46.09]That's important.
[12:46.65]Alright, now let's go get what we need.
[12:50.46]Forget about all the... I'm not going to do any of this shit.
[12:52.92]I'd be lucky if I played this for more than 30 minutes.
[12:55.38]Well, it was supposed to be an hour, but you get it.
[12:56.78]You understand.
[12:58.80]You can hit.
[13:01.63]No shit.
[13:02.49]No fucking way.
[13:20.82]That's too much for anybody's brain.
[13:31.76]No, I'm just going to do it like this.
[13:34.28]That's too much.
[13:35.00]I don't want to do it like that.
[13:35.98]Alright, let's get this place cleaned up.
[13:43.51]I don't need that big of a house.
[13:44.99]I do have to go down.
[13:45.91]This is the basement right here.
[13:48.11]With this water.
[13:49.33]This way.
[13:53.37]Let's go over here.
[13:54.43]His stone.
[13:55.98]Alright.
[13:59.12]My house is over there.
[13:59.96]Is water going to get in here?
[14:05.76]I need... I need coal.
[14:19.27]Check your recipe book.
[14:20.31]I know.
[14:21.78]What about over here?
[14:24.26]Where the fuck am I?
[14:25.38]I don't want to be on this waterfront.
[14:29.07]I need to get coal.
[14:30.67]I'm just gonna go straight down here.
[14:45.15]I will say, this is probably the coolest way you could play Minecraft.
[14:54.09]Alright, you see a coal?
[15:01.73]It's getting dark out, I need coal right now.
[15:04.42]You can burn wood too, can't you?
[15:12.73]Stone axe, I know.
[15:16.15]I don't have a weapon.
[15:24.36]How long is the day-night cycle?
[15:28.84]I'm actually fucking getting scared, though.
[15:30.24]This actually is scary.
[15:51.25]There's a creeper over there.
[15:52.11]Alright, I'm gonna go burn wood.
[15:55.78]Is that where I can burn wood, right?
[15:57.70]Where's my house?
[16:07.39]Over here.
[16:16.38]Okay, at night this is a much different game.
[16:19.38]Who cares if I die?
[16:21.30]There we go, right here.
[16:22.08]I need to make a furnace, right?
[16:26.55]This is gonna be the house.
[16:27.80]Might as well... Is that a creeper face right there?
[16:33.34]That's a creeper just staring at me, right?
[16:36.14]It's coming in warts!
[16:37.18]That's a- that's a wart creeper!
[16:41.08]Must have been added in the fucking 1.2 update.
[16:42.65]Alright, let's see here.
[16:48.31]I need... Uh... Is that not a furnace?
[16:57.82]That's not a furnace?
[16:58.44]How is that not a furnace?
[17:11.81]It's eight in a... Isn't this a crafting bench, though?
[17:17.85]Am I... Is something... What's going on here?
[17:19.83]Am I in the crafting menu?
[17:22.83]This is the crafting table, isn't it?
[17:31.73]That's not the- I haven't played Minecraft actually for real without being drunk in like four years.
[17:57.41]It's the crafting table.
[17:59.09]Isn't- that's not what this is?
[18:02.36]This is not a crafting table.
[18:08.11]I just was trying to open this.
[18:11.19]What the fuck?
[18:33.31]Is this gravel?
[18:36.94]God damn it.
[18:39.46]Just give it back.
[18:40.06]Give it.
[18:40.28]Just get out.
[18:44.62]It's kind of awkward.
[18:47.34]It's kind of awkward menus.
[18:49.22]Alright, so put this down.
[18:53.89]This is not that good either.
[18:57.11]Alright, move over here.
[19:00.43]So I've got to put some wood in here.
[19:04.91]Does that count?
[19:08.19]No.
[19:08.93]Charcoal, I can't just put, like, I can't put, like, a tree in there?
[19:12.11]It's gotta be, like, a block of wood, right?
[19:16.12]No, I don't even have an axe.
[19:18.92]I need a regular fucking bench.
[19:21.94]Like a storage unit or something.
[19:24.61]There's something fucking here.
[19:29.10]so left button is it's up here it's odd because every other place you press is jump this is place okay it's hard to see so it's like a tint it's like hard to see it from here remember I'm working with like half the resolution that you guys are seeing
[20:02.88]Let's just start making a fucking house.
[20:08.84]Alright, here we go.
[20:09.56]What happened to the fucking view?
[20:11.24]That's way too many creepers.
[20:12.32]That's a joke.
[20:13.77]I'm getting stream sniped by like seven creepers over here.
[20:17.75]You knew I was going to be streaming over here.
[20:19.77]Are you fucking serious?
[20:27.69]That was at least five or six right there.
[20:31.16]No joke.
[20:32.59]Alright, let's go.
[20:43.71]How do I sneak?
[20:46.96]Not like that.
[20:49.54]I don't give a shit.
[20:50.18]I can fix it later.
[20:54.32]Uh, the ceilings are way too high.
[20:55.90]I don't know how to sneak on this controller.
[20:58.10]Anyone know how to sneak?
[20:59.87]You just crouch in real life.
[21:00.99]That's a lie.
[21:07.41]That's not how you do it.
[21:10.77]Close your closet.
[21:13.45]I can't do that right now.
[21:17.70]Let's just... I'll go over here.
[21:31.63]Everybody starts with a dirt house.
[21:32.77]For shelter.
[21:34.19]For shelter.
[21:43.48]I gotta come out here a little.
[21:44.86]I'm close to something.
[21:48.38]What are you doing?
[21:55.10]One more?
[21:55.40]Look at that.
[22:00.46]Okay, now.
[22:10.06]What am I, what am I near?
[22:12.61]Only non-pro gamers use dirt.
[22:18.94]The desk is over here.
[22:23.40]That's a new monster.
[22:24.26]How do I take care of this monster?
[22:35.31]Ah!
[22:40.99]Can't...
[22:42.35]Why is he faster in water?
[22:50.95]Monster Hunter.
[22:51.81]Alright, get the fuck out of here.
[22:53.43]Hurry up.
[22:54.29]Climb back up.
[22:55.89]Sun's coming up.
[23:01.08]The monsters are huge.
[23:03.04]I guess you are just the same size, right?
[23:05.90]Alright, where was I?
[23:08.10]I gotta find something to light the house with.
[23:10.96]At least
[23:26.87]Alright, that's fine.
[23:27.99]I just need a wall over here.
[23:29.95]Anyone know how to sneak?
[23:31.15]Turn on the music.
[23:32.35]The music is on.
[23:37.48]Change your scale above 100%.
[23:39.02]Actually, I like it like this, though.
[23:48.80]Alright, there we go.
[23:49.24]That's all I need.
[23:49.74]Then just this way.
[23:53.22]And this is it.
[23:53.72]Then I'm going to build a roof.
[23:56.57]I got two.
[23:57.25]I think it's coming along alright.
[24:04.54]That looks fine.
[24:14.14]This is just a placeholder.
[24:16.84]Okay, I gotta go on a search.
[24:18.55]I gotta go on an adventure for diamonds.
[24:20.49]Not diamonds.
[24:21.11]Fuck.
[24:21.49]Stone.
[24:22.01]Stone.
[24:29.39]Home sweet home!
[24:30.73]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of TurboCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[24:38.59]And if you can get yourself into a nice seated, comfortable position, hands inside the ride at all times, we're going to make our way over down there.
[24:46.49]I think that way, maybe there's some diamonds over there.
[24:49.80]I got myself a, uh, I got a cider.
[24:52.96]I hope you got one too.
[24:54.74]That's good.
[24:56.46]And there you go.
[24:58.50]There's the clip that I will see posted to my channel 5,000 times a week until the day I'm dead.
[25:09.39]At my funeral, one of you guys is going to show up and fucking put that on like a tablet and place it on the casket.
[25:24.56]We need a comparison.
[25:25.68]Alright, first of all, lambs.
[25:28.58]I'll take one.
[25:34.35]I almost just fucking fell over.
[25:44.79]I need that.
[25:47.96]Alright, I got the meat.
[25:48.70]Am I not supposed to be doing this?
[26:01.06]Just fucking break it with your hands.
[26:16.55]Oh, kids are going to love this.
[26:19.04]I'm serious.
[26:19.68]Kids are going to love this.
[26:22.06]Have any kids played this yet?
[26:23.06]Alright, what was I doing?
[26:28.12]Okay, I got wool.
[26:28.84]I can make a bed now.
[26:31.02]Now I just need three pieces of wood.
[26:35.28]How about this one?
[26:36.26]Looks good to me.
[26:36.82]This is a different kind of wood though, right?
[26:59.20]Okay, now bring that to the crafting branch.
[27:03.76]Make a bed.
[27:11.35]There it is, this is my house.
[27:12.05]You can always tell because it's a wall of dirt.
[27:23.72]Holy shit Jerm, I'm not gonna read that one.
[27:27.92]The house is ruined.
[27:28.76]It hasn't even started yet.
[27:32.96]Oh, that makes me want to throw up a little bit.
[27:34.34]I'm not gonna lie.
[27:36.52]Okay.
[27:37.10]Now... I need... I need an axe.
[27:40.58]I need... No.
[27:41.40]God, it's... It's so... There's so much going on in my brain.
[27:45.55]Open this up.
[27:47.25]With this menu.
[27:48.17]Okay.
[27:49.49]So... I need to make this shit.
[27:54.55]I'll take it.
[27:55.31]All of it, please.
[27:57.80]And it's one, two, three.
[27:59.32]And then bang.
[28:02.48]Got yourself a fucking bed.
[28:05.03]Perfect.
[28:06.27]So now when I die, I will spawn here.
[28:14.41]That's not how, I don't think, that's not how you place it, right?
[28:16.17]You have to... Which way do I want the bed?
[28:21.94]Who cares?
[28:23.42]That's not bad.
[28:23.90]It is your entrance right here.
[28:25.86]Put a door.
[28:34.41]Okay, there's the door.
[28:35.21]We'll come in here.
[28:37.08]Put a staircase there.
[28:37.92]What do you guys think?
[28:40.80]The bed is near your spawn point.
[28:42.60]What do you mean?
[28:43.64]That is the spawn point.
[28:51.12]Alright, and let's just get some... I need some... Do I have enough wood for it, right?
[28:54.16]I need to jump.
[28:56.62]Jumping's a little weird.
[29:00.27]Let's go with... No, that's sand.
[29:09.92]How do you make an axe?
[29:12.76]Like that or something?
[29:13.62]How do you make the chopping tree axe?
[29:27.89]Oh, okay, like that.
[29:32.33]I need a box.
[29:33.71]How do you make a box?
[29:34.49]It's like this, right?
[29:40.75]Yeah, put that here.
[29:41.67]Alright, get out of this menu.
[29:49.76]Get out of the menu.
[29:52.18]The fuck?
[29:54.00]So now let's put this here.
[29:55.72]I just need to put a bunch of dumb shit in here.
[29:58.18]Um, I don't know.
[29:58.94]Put like the... Can I send it there quickly without having to tap like a million times?
[30:05.29]There's got to be a way I can press that and just have it send over there, right?
[30:08.13]Or do I actually have to physically do this?
[30:12.37]Because I had that pick, throw.
[30:14.49]There's a button to do it.
[30:19.36]Just try everything.
[30:21.50]Try everything.
[30:22.84]Alright, that's right.
[30:24.54]This is left.
[30:25.90]This is up.
[30:27.44]This is pick up.
[30:29.36]This is right, down, left, button.
[30:42.37]Try jumping.
[30:44.41]There you go.
[30:44.81]You got your clip.
[30:47.01]You might have to set it in the control menu.
[30:48.43]Ah, whatever.
[30:48.91]Alright, gravel, cobblestone.
[30:51.90]It's not actually that big of a deal.
[30:53.32]It really is not.
[30:55.44]That kind of sucks, though.
[30:59.52]Alright, I got meat.
[31:00.36]Let's get that in here.
[31:01.22]You die, right, if you don't eat?
[31:05.97]Keep the dirt, keep the sand.
[31:07.15]Just fucking throw this in the trash.
[31:13.95]Uh, these are almost broken.
[31:14.84]I don't know, I need more cobblestone.
[31:19.10]Okay, this is, this is sparter.
[31:23.02]Ugh.
[31:23.90]That wasn't me almost puking, that was me just burping.
[31:26.32]Everything's fine.
[31:27.78]Wood.
[31:28.84]Let's go.
[31:38.29]I'm gonna cut down every tree.
[31:45.42]And I'm not gonna replant them.
[31:50.76]I don't want them here.
[31:51.36]I'm gonna plant all the trees over there.
[31:52.96]Okay, I'm gonna get like maybe 30 or 40, probably 30 to 50 more full trees.
[32:22.41]If Microsoft owns this company now, can't I just pay some money?
[32:26.49]Like 15 bucks?
[32:28.19]To already have leather fucking jackets on?
[32:31.56]And already have... What is that noise?
[32:33.82]I don't know.
[32:54.17]Yeah, like, where's my, like, $12 you don't have to cut a tree down anymore?
[33:04.26]I'd buy it twice.
[33:05.26]Times two speed.
[33:09.08]Okay, that's good.
[33:13.88]Did I get them all?
[33:25.95]Wood tools.
[33:26.69]I know.
[33:27.59]I know.
[33:27.87]I'm fucking terrible.
[33:33.43]Wood.
[33:33.89]He's using wood tools.
[33:36.63]What is that?
[33:43.53]What is this thing?
[33:45.92]Is that a fish?
[33:52.64]This fish in Minecraft?
[33:54.26]How long ago was this put in?
[33:56.92]What happened to that guy?
[34:00.16]It is a fish!
[34:01.80]That's so cool.
[34:03.06]Is there a fishing rod?
[34:08.57]I thought that was an error.
[34:10.35]Like a source engine error spinning around.
[34:14.81]They come out with a massive ocean update.
[34:16.63]Really?
[34:17.63]That's pretty cool.
[34:21.70]Punch the fish.
[34:24.00]No, not now.
[34:25.18]I'm too busy.
[34:31.94]Maybe in, like, a little bit... Hold on.
[34:33.95]Alright, I need... I need... I just need stone.
[34:39.13]Just give me stone.
[34:40.41]There's my stone cavity right here.
[34:44.15]Just give me a bunch of it.
[35:00.41]This is gonna break.
[35:05.69]Is that... I need to make a stone pickaxe.
[35:08.64]Just go, quick.
[35:15.04]With a bed?
[35:18.30]You need to be even shorter.
[35:19.47]Yeah, I'm too tall to ride that ride.
[35:23.25]I know, right?
[35:24.37]Crazy.
[35:27.13]Fish?
[35:27.67]No.
[35:27.91]Alright, let's get this going here.
[35:30.69]No, not when there is.
[35:39.23]I need sticks.
[35:40.15]Fuck.
[35:43.25]I'm safe.
[35:43.71]Am I safe in the house?
[35:45.42]That's... That's a glass of milk.
[35:49.02]Why does the moon look like that?
[35:52.58]Why is the moon a fucking rectangle?
[35:58.80]Alright.
[36:00.76]Here we go.
[36:01.22]Just make a ton of these.
[36:05.92]Can I do this faster?
[36:06.70]I guess.
[36:07.44]Just by tapping it.
[36:09.37]What's the button to make this happen instantly with everything?
[36:15.03]I'm going to have to go on the controls and see what it is.
[36:17.77]Not now, though.
[36:18.23]I'm only going to wait.
[36:18.83]Alright.
[36:23.52]So now, let's get some... What the hell is that?
[36:30.16]No, I just want... I just want some sticks.
[36:36.03]Oh, right.
[36:36.33]They have to be on top of each other.
[36:41.14]20 sticks, that sounds good.
[36:48.38]Alright, give me some good tools now.
[36:52.33]Now I can break iron, right?
[36:54.07]Let's make two of these.
[36:59.73]No, that's the worst item in the game.
[37:04.29]Alright, let's make a sword.
[37:10.83]Gonna need that.
[37:13.23]And, alright.
[37:19.87]Looks fine.
[37:25.81]Put the sticks back.
[37:31.00]And throw the, actually no, these are extreme backups, I need them.
[37:37.38]I can hold onto that.
[37:38.98]Cobblestone, put it up here.
[37:42.03]Alright.
[37:45.95]I'm ready.
[37:46.47]Let's go.
[37:50.59]Get in the bed.
[37:51.17]No, I know the trick here, guys.
[38:00.66]If I get in this bed, they're gonna be standing over me.
[38:03.00]They're gonna be hovering over my face.
[38:05.00]I have to sleep with my knife out.
[38:11.58]That's old.
[38:14.90]I thought if you were sleeping out in the open, then monsters just spawned like in your face.
[38:19.25]Now I know it skips the night, but that doesn't happen anymore?
[38:26.41]They patched that out.
[38:27.37]That was the reason why I quit Minecraft.
[38:34.20]Warcraft server mod.
[38:39.52]Why do I have a Warcraft mod?
[38:41.18]What?
[38:45.96]Why do you have Warcraft?
[38:48.29]I do not have that.
[38:53.43]No, that's not it.
[38:54.61]Let me be very, very, very clear.
[38:55.89]There's not a joke reveal there.
[38:57.83]This isn't like, oh, he's just pretending to play vanilla fucking Minecraft, and all of a sudden the sorcerer's gonna show up, and he's gonna start casting fucking spells at people.
[39:05.46]No.
[39:07.38]Everyone thinks that's what, that's what, no.
[39:09.00]I'm sorry, guys.
[39:09.56]You're gonna be really disappointed in like 20 minutes.
[39:12.58]Alright, let's go on an adventure.
[39:14.96]And by adventure, I mean let's just go break stuff until I find diamonds.
[39:18.47]And then we're going to stop playing.
[39:19.63]What do you say?
[39:24.49]I need to leave a remember trail here.
[39:30.86]Yeah, I'm like a dog, guys.
[39:32.62]I need to have this.
[40:08.02]Okay, so if I just follow the fucking Hansel and Gretel trail.
[40:13.81]Here we go.
[40:15.21]Let's go right here.
[40:19.03]I'm going right here.
[40:29.64]It broke.
[40:31.16]I didn't get a show.
[40:32.66]Don't matter.
[40:33.02]Don't even need it.
[40:33.44]Here it is.
[40:34.12]Got it.
[40:34.38]This is it, right?
[40:39.25]What is this?
[40:39.99]Is that what I need?
[40:48.31]No.
[40:48.81]It's like little coal pieces, right?
[40:50.41]Oh, this is like the easiest resource in the whole game.
[40:57.70]Because then I can make torches.
[41:21.70]Oh, I remember this song.
[41:27.24]What a nostalgic stream this really turned out to be.
[41:29.86]You guys remember?
[41:35.08]Remember... when you were eleven... three years ago?
[41:52.35]Who are you?
[41:52.73]Okay, let me, like, look, look, look, look.
[41:54.43]Hold on.
[41:56.03]I'm 39.
[41:56.21]Listen.
[41:56.67]This is a... How many viewers are here?
[42:06.23]Like, 4K?
[42:09.55]There's probably at least... People probably only are at this stream because it's Minecraft.
[42:12.65]And it's a great fucking game.
[42:13.87]I'm gonna stop swearing.
[42:17.91]I remember when I was 11, like, 10 years ago.
[42:20.19]Wasn't that long ago.
[42:24.82]Absolutely not.
[42:26.48]Change the FOV?
[42:27.28]What do you mean the FOV?
[42:29.26]Is the FOV bad?
[42:36.59]What's wrong with the FOV?
[42:43.50]Wait, hold on.
[42:43.88]You mean like in here?
[42:44.98]Dynamic FOV?
[42:59.26]What a fog start, where is it?
[43:06.81]The FOV on the webcam.
[43:11.69]Why'd you decide to play Minecraft?
[43:13.01]Because I lost a bet.
[43:14.40]And I'm gonna be very salty about it.
[43:19.12]What a messy closet.
[43:20.50]That's just an optical illusion.
[43:26.06]He's answering the FOV prayers.
[43:29.22]I don't see it in the menu.
[43:31.86]Performance.
[43:33.62]Chunks.
[43:36.66]Other.
[43:43.31]Max frame rate.
[43:44.19]View bobbing off.
[43:45.29]Use VOBs.
[43:47.19]Dynamic FOV is not the same.
[43:49.37]It's not in the video settings.
[43:56.21]It's in the actual VR settings.
[44:01.93]Stereo rendering.
[44:06.46]Stereo rendering.
[44:07.56]Mirror display.
[44:09.50]Hold on.
[44:09.94]Back it up.
[44:13.42]HUD.
[44:13.82]Head HUD.
[44:16.56]Hide HUD.
[44:18.62]World scale.
[44:21.05]Locomotion.
[44:25.05]Controls?
[44:30.90]Let me just see.
[44:31.50]Oh, this is quick commands.
[44:36.88]Crosshair size.
[44:39.72]Maybe it's scale.
[44:44.64]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[44:45.14]Hold on.
[44:48.34]Rotation.
[44:49.10]No.
[44:49.74]FOV comfort reduction.
[44:52.41]Shrinks the field of view while moving.
[44:54.93]Can help.
[44:55.41]No.
[44:57.83]That's not it.
[45:06.07]It's under controls.
[45:12.88]Sensitivity.
[45:14.40]Touchpad mode.
[45:15.28]Auto jump.
[45:15.74]Invert mouse.
[45:28.33]There is no FOV.
[45:32.81]You guys are just fucking with me.
[45:40.26]Turn down the... It's actually on the Vive.
[45:55.58]Turn up the brightness.
[46:01.15]I'm trying to do a nostalgia trip for all of us 40 year olds that when they were 11, 30 years ago when they played this game,
[46:09.50]And what I was going to say, I might even talk in the right direction.
[46:12.92]What I was going to say is, the reason why I said that comment is because there's probably people that are here that love Minecraft and are like, love this shit.
[46:22.71]And they don't watch these streams.
[46:24.01]So I'm going to stop saying bad things.
[46:30.86]This is a nice house.
[46:31.64]I think I'll keep this one.
[46:32.42]Alright, I'll turn the brightness up.
[46:34.74]I'll at least do you that.
[46:44.44]How do I do that?
[46:48.16]Dynamic lights, quality shaders.
[46:54.34]Oh, that's my entire IP address.
[46:57.19]It's every IP I've ever had.
[47:10.65]Anybody know where this is?
[47:13.56]Am I blind?
[47:14.62]No, I, okay.
[47:15.96]Brightness, moody.
[47:18.30]I see, I see the, I see moody.
[47:20.17]I don't, that's not a, this doesn't even do anything.
[47:46.58]Fuckin' Minecraft VR.
[47:47.96]I always just clicked that thinking that you guys were gonna appear.
[47:58.28]Alright, let's go back.
[47:59.07]We'll put up brightness up to, like, plus 20.
[48:02.99]There you go.
[48:04.21]Now everybody can see!
[48:05.53]Now everybody can have so much fun!
[48:06.69]Oh boy, Minecraft!
[48:08.23]Remember when we did that Picross level and we cheated and now he has to play this?
[48:12.95]That's why he's here!
[48:21.70]This actually is really cool.
[48:24.79]I'm not gonna fuck around.
[48:27.59]This is actually really cool.
[48:32.13]Okay, I'm gonna hurt the fucking vibe.
[48:35.66]Here we go.
[48:37.20]Can I please get back to what I was doing now?
[48:51.05]Just give me... Ooh, we found ourselves a cavern.
[48:56.25]This is what you play for.
[48:58.22]There it is.
[48:58.84]There it is.
[48:59.42]There it is.
[48:59.84]There it is.
[49:00.56]There it is.
[49:00.96]This is gonna kill me.
[49:06.93]Oh, shit.
[49:07.35]Is this... Will I die from this?
[49:22.25]This is really interesting like this.
[49:26.85]I just get this and then... That was a big chunk, right?
[49:35.38]Is that it?
[49:35.70]That's all that was here?
[49:39.44]Ooh, fuck, look at that.
[49:47.33]Oh well, I'm getting like Warcraft stones.
[49:50.96]Do I actually have a mod?
[49:52.27]Why am I getting the Warcraft stones?
[49:54.79]That's a mod, right?
[49:55.63]That's like mana?
[49:57.77]It's a joke.
[49:58.51]I'm kidding.
[49:59.77]I'm making that up.
[50:01.45]I know what it is.
[50:05.83]It's experience points.
[50:09.28]Oh, Jerva's getting like real salty lately.
[50:12.08]What's going on with that?
[50:14.44]I haven't watched the streams in like a few weeks.
[50:16.64]Jerva's like really salty.
[50:23.99]What was that?
[50:25.13]Okay.
[50:31.75]Ah!
[50:31.97]Where?
[50:33.73]Holy shit, that's so much worse in VR.
[50:43.11]Jesus.
[50:44.85]He got his gallbladder.
[50:46.86]Okay, I need to make... I need to make some torches here.
[51:07.27]Finally, I have light.
[51:08.19]Alright, close this up.
[51:12.41]Wow.
[51:14.45]Oh, turn the brightness up, Jeremy.
[51:18.01]I can't see, Jeremy.
[51:21.20]He's looking real salty, ain't he, Jeremy?
[51:30.46]Human fingers.
[51:34.33]I know it's here.
[51:35.15]I see it.
[52:00.07]Is that it?
[52:10.53]Do you think they'll be talking about Minecraft as... That's not a real wall.
[52:14.98]Do you think they'll be talking about Minecraft as one of the greatest human inventions in like 100 years or something?
[52:23.04]Do you think kids 100 years from now, this will be in a textbook?
[52:27.82]I think it will be.
[52:30.59]I really do.
[52:31.03]I really think they'll be talking about this.
[52:32.25]It'll be the invention of the water fountain, the wheel, and then the washing machine, Minecraft.
[52:42.54]They'll all be in a row.
[52:48.71]This goes really... Alright, there's a creeper down there.
[52:51.59]Is that... No, that's not a creeper.
[52:52.49]What the hell is that?
[52:59.24]That's one of those bow skeletons, right?
[53:15.03]Come on, I can't reach.
[53:15.83]Are they mice?
[53:20.91]What the fuck is that?
[53:22.01]Is there bats?
[53:25.69]What else is in this game?
[53:32.08]Alright, I gotta be... There's so much shit down here.
[53:49.07]That does hurt my fucking neck and back.
[53:52.95]I don't think it's worth me doing this.
[53:54.05]Let me just go over here.
[53:57.65]Get out the sword.
[54:04.45]Look at all this shit.
[54:05.17]Okay, hold on.
[54:05.81]Diamonds.
[54:14.03]This goes so deep.
[54:16.53]I'm almost out of pickaxe fluid.
[54:18.65]Alright, it's time to go back up.
[54:23.18]I gotta go back up.
[54:31.26]Almost.
[54:32.70]I got plenty, though.
[54:33.94]That's good.
[54:39.23]Let me get the ball before it breaks.
[54:52.34]Good.
[55:04.23]Okay.
[55:05.73]Time to get out of here.
[55:07.77]I hear water.
[55:10.58]Right there.
[55:13.56]What the hell was that?
[55:16.36]Why did a horror movie door just open?
[55:27.85]Oh, there's a... There's a dungeon?
[55:32.13]Alright, I'm gonna remember this then.
[55:33.49]Remember this.
[55:33.93]Alright, let's go up.
[55:39.02]I can't go up.
[55:41.74]I have to make a crafting bench down here.
[55:51.75]No, I have a secret one.
[55:52.69]Okay, never mind.
[55:53.25]I heard a car.
[56:02.16]Alright, let's go.
[56:06.06]Let's get the hell out of here.
[56:13.26]I can get a couple of these if I really want.
[56:15.22]I'm doing that the worst possible way.
[56:21.11]Might as well get them all, right?
[56:42.21]This has got to be some kind of record of coal in one spot.
[56:47.76]It just never ends.
[56:50.86]Oh, he unveiled the secret iron!
[57:11.06]Cool, is that it?
[57:13.08]That's it.
[57:13.58]Alright, I can just go up here.
[57:16.94]I see there's dirt right there, which means I'm at land.
[57:21.85]Where I will be in a second.
[57:24.77]The best part of Minecraft is when you come out of the sewer hole.
[57:30.11]And you just look around and see where you are.
[57:57.63]Okay, a little bit more.
[58:09.77]Alright, let's see where we're going to end up.
[58:32.77]How far down did I go?
[58:37.15]What?
[58:46.22]I can't be that much further.
[58:58.27]Ugh!
[59:02.42]Uh-oh.
[59:04.72]Where's my trail?
[59:05.70]Where's my trail?
[59:07.08]Where was it?
[59:07.54]That was so cool.
[59:08.58]Okay, where's my trail?
[59:09.84]Right there!
[59:10.20]Oh my god, I'm dead!
[59:18.66]Oh my god, I'm dead!
[59:27.44]Oh!
[59:27.70]Go!
[59:28.34]What's happening?
[59:29.36]Go!
[59:38.57]Okay, here we go.
[59:39.07]And we're good.
[59:55.08]Cook, eat.
[59:56.59]I got seven out of 10.
[59:59.13]Alright, let me go, hold on.
[60:03.93]Let's, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[60:05.99]What do I need?
[60:08.12]Focus.
[60:10.12]Focus, Mike.
[60:11.02]Focus.
[60:13.63]Don't say your real name, though.
[60:15.91]People will fucking know.
[60:21.23]Don't know who you are.
[60:21.87]Alright, let's just make a fucking bunch of these.
[60:31.94]I'm gonna make 64 of them.
[60:43.36]Alright, now I need to put them in here.
[60:48.80]So get me the hell out of here.
[60:57.74]That's all I want.
[60:58.48]Just enough so I can see what the hell I'm doing later.
[61:00.32]Alright, where's that meat?
[61:04.32]I need to cook the meat in the furnace.
[61:07.22]So let's get that meat.
[61:10.85]Okay.
[61:13.83]Put it down here.
[61:15.54]Can I eat the egg sac?
[61:16.38]Here we go.
[61:28.33]Perfect.
[61:32.23]Why is the screen flashing?
[61:33.21]It's because I'm dying.
[61:40.05]Once I have a couple of cooked meats, I'll be just fine.
[61:43.72]For instance.
[61:46.36]How do you eat it?
[61:50.50]You actually have to put it in your mouth.
[61:58.34]Okay.
[62:05.53]Go kill it.
[62:06.13]Is that rare?
[62:08.45]What are the squids?
[62:09.35]I think there were squids when I played before.
[62:12.52]that I can really remember.
[62:13.40]Alright, let's move.
[62:19.12]I gotta make some gear.
[62:21.12]Let's make some iron helmets.
[62:28.46]Alright, this is just a joke.
[62:31.45]Why is there no sell button?
[62:33.61]Why can't I have a little thing over here that I can just drag and it just sells it?
[62:42.88]Get the spider sack thing out of here.
[62:47.14]Wheat seeds.
[62:49.34]Oak saplings.
[62:50.16]Get out of here.
[62:50.70]I need to make a bunch of shit.
[62:53.81]I'm going to make my house out of... I'm going to make the floor out of wood.
[62:56.93]And the walls out of stone.
[62:59.99]Get all this.
[63:01.03]What the hell?
[63:01.79]Andesite?
[63:04.93]Diorite?
[63:13.63]What are these?
[63:15.75]The new materials?
[63:21.14]I'm going to hold on to them just in case I need them.
[63:23.90]Let's make some shit.
[63:25.54]So I need sticks.
[63:27.00]Let's go over here.
[63:27.68]Alright, we got... Let's make a bunch.
[63:43.31]Now let's go with 1, 2.
[63:46.69]I'm going to make... Oh, you have to smelt the iron.
[63:49.45]It just bars, right?
[63:53.75]Let me start that process.
[63:59.63]Come here.
[64:03.26]Go for it.
[64:05.76]And then I can make iron pickaxe, iron sword, iron shield, iron armor.
[64:16.38]Did I just see any good movies?
[64:20.94]Deerite, andesite, and granite are cosmetic stones.
[64:23.42]Okay.
[64:24.82]You can dual wield?
[64:33.41]Why am I in my swim trunks?
[64:38.61]Guys, it's a nice day today.
[64:42.33]And... I didn't go swimming.
[64:48.06]I wanted to though.
[64:53.86]How did something get in my eye?
[64:55.72]How is that possible?
[64:58.00]How is it possible that something got in my eye?
[65:00.70]I was locked in.
[65:01.32]I was pressured closed in here.
[65:08.45]How long has it been?
[65:09.49]Have I been playing Minecraft for an hour?
[65:13.33]I've been in Minecraft VR for an hour and six minutes.
[65:20.98]What the fuck?
[65:26.46]Yeah, I've been having fun.
[65:29.06]Told you, I'm gonna get the diamonds.
[65:31.04]I'm gonna make a diamond pickaxe.
[65:33.17]Then I'm gonna swing as hard as I can down through my stomach.
[65:37.09]And uninstall the game.
[65:49.00]Alright.
[65:49.84]That was weird.
[65:50.90]Oh, I need water, too.
[65:52.20]Where's my... Can somebody guide me?
[65:59.52]Recipe for disaster, recipe for disaster, recipe for disaster, recipe for disaster.
[66:12.61]I need a fucking straw.
[66:13.57]I need a tube.
[66:31.84]Drinking is really hard when you can't see.
[66:33.76]Why?
[66:35.74]We do it so often.
[66:36.68]We do it every day.
[66:38.00]Thousands of times a week.
[66:40.40]Why is it so hard to do anything?
[66:48.91]Where's the other iron?
[66:51.55]Right there, 14.
[66:54.37]Let me get this, close this up.
[66:57.61]What just happened?
[67:02.44]Green tea sip has made the advancement.
[67:05.40]Why is this in my other hand?
[67:07.58]How do I get that out of my hand?
[67:08.98]How do I take this off?
[67:15.26]Maybe do I want... How do I get this off?
[67:26.44]Okay.
[67:27.60]Let me... I don't like that.
[67:36.47]Is there a reason why I can't grab this now?
[67:38.95]What happened?
[67:48.94]What did I do?
[67:52.20]Too far away?
[67:53.02]I don't think... No, they usually have the cursor.
[68:00.10]It's in the slot.
[68:01.35]Yeah, but... Okay, ready?
[68:03.91]See?
[68:04.99]Open the furnace!
[68:06.38]Curse is gone.
[68:17.77]It's your finger.
[68:20.99]No, it's not?
[68:23.41]Did the game lose focus?
[68:24.63]I don't think so.
[68:39.32]It did.
[68:39.56]I don't know how.
[68:41.70]I told you.
[68:45.41]Can we get a round of applause for VR, Josh?
[68:52.39]This is my favorite song.
[68:53.75]Alright, so let's make some good tools.
[68:58.02]Over here.
[69:04.86]So, let's do the most important one.
[69:12.18]Solar paneling.
[69:21.17]I'm gonna make two of these.
[69:24.93]This is a helmet, right?
[69:25.75]This is a chest piece?
[69:33.41]What's the chest?
[69:43.66]I know this is legs.
[69:46.06]Or I thought it was.
[69:48.66]Alright, should I make boots?
[69:53.34]Should I make tools first?
[69:55.20]I'm gonna make tools first.
[69:58.41]I don't care if it's wrong.
[69:59.53]I might never see iron ever again.
[70:03.61]Extreme backup.
[70:11.53]Make another sword.
[70:14.95]Another pickaxe.
[70:15.93]I have three pickaxes.
[70:22.33]Three iron pickaxes.
[70:24.94]I have two right now.
[70:25.96]And I want a shovel too.
[70:28.82]I want two shovels.
[70:39.62]And...
[70:42.01]Wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?
[70:43.68]What's wrong with my axe?
[70:44.84]What's wrong?
[70:46.06]What's wrong?
[70:52.70]What's going on?
[70:57.29]You only need two... I'm fine, I'm good.
[71:01.87]I use the shovel a lot.
[71:08.72]Okay, so that's... One, two, three...
[71:11.94]One, two, let's get this down here.
[71:22.84]I'm not gonna use that right now.
[71:23.80]Alright, storage.
[71:27.05]Is it an iron pick?
[71:28.45]Yeah.
[71:33.25]Put the deal right.
[71:36.33]All this shit in here.
[71:37.23]Put the iron in there.
[71:38.07]I'm gonna keep the meat on me.
[71:42.28]I'm going to keep some coal.
[71:44.44]Not all of it, just in case something horrible happens.
[71:46.16]Eleven.
[71:47.38]That's fine.
[71:47.76]I'm going to put that there.
[71:51.14]I got this here.
[71:53.74]Sticks.
[71:54.22]Don't need them.
[71:57.76]Birch planks.
[71:59.66]Sand.
[72:00.48]Don't need sand anymore.
[72:01.30]Don't need dirt.
[72:01.88]Get them out of here.
[72:10.00]Okay, let me just get rid of these.
[72:32.54]What was it?
[72:33.02]It was like... It was some weird button.
[72:35.08]I did it before.
[72:37.14]There it is.
[72:37.46]Okay.
[72:48.65]Time to build the house.
[72:49.41]You ready?
[72:50.23]You ready for the most boring part of this whole stream?
[72:53.37]Or it could be fun.
[72:55.23]I'll do it quick.
[72:55.75]Don't worry.
[72:56.07]I thought those were all monsters.
[73:03.36]Oak.
[73:04.06]Cobblestone.
[73:04.78]Let's at least get a nice floor.
[73:05.72]Okay.
[73:16.99]I can't believe he doesn't even have a texture pack.
[73:19.73]Unbelievable.
[73:32.36]Use your shovel, I know.
[73:35.05]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[73:37.41]That's why I made two.
[73:46.82]This is sick.
[74:02.93]Not bad, not bad.
[74:05.41]Just there's a method to my madness, just wait.
[74:14.66]Clear this out.
[74:16.02]It's not going to be perfect, but it'll at least look alright.
[74:22.61]There, there, shit just floats, right?
[74:26.85]Yeah.
[74:32.33]Yeah.
[74:39.86]Should I have the bodies down here?
[74:49.20]No.
[74:49.54]No, no, no, no.
[74:50.20]Don't sleep.
[74:50.96]Leave the bed.
[74:54.64]Not yet.
[75:13.45]Alright.
[75:14.87]Looking good.
[75:16.53]Okay.
[75:19.03]How do you even like do Minecraft commentary?
[75:21.81]How do I even like say what it is?
[75:23.19]Okay, there we are.
[75:25.04]We got wood here now, folks.
[75:27.32]Alright.
[75:29.64]Looks pretty good.
[75:31.00]At the time that I had jury duty,
[75:35.83]Yeah.
[75:37.83]Gave the guy the chair!
[75:48.09]Uh, it don't matter.
[75:49.53]Does it matter if I don't have that here?
[75:56.36]Switch shoulder with shovel.
[75:58.78]Oh, shit.
[75:59.48]Does the button on my hand do it?
[76:02.78]Alright.
[76:04.00]Holy shit, people are so smart.
[76:07.52]wow this is you can't do this in regular Minecraft you can oh well oh well no don't do that alright that's good something I think a lot of you guys might underestimate
[76:35.83]or overestimate is the fact that if I have a piece of green here that I'm not, it's okay.
[76:41.07]I'm going to be fine.
[76:59.28]I'm not going to look at chat.
[77:01.46]I'm not going to look.
[77:02.76]I already know what you're saying.
[77:04.33]I already know what you're saying.
[77:05.33]I don't need to look.
[77:11.31]How do I use this?
[77:17.78]This is slower than doing it with... This is slower!
[77:32.80]I should be doing sword in this hand.
[77:39.27]No, I didn't see the short joke.
[77:40.57]I saw that I'm not using my shovel.
[77:43.35]What the?
[77:44.93]Why do I have two ice creams?
[77:47.33]All I need is one.
[77:49.63]And why the fuck is this one not chocolate?
[77:51.66]Is what I want to ask.
[77:53.40]Kill fish.
[78:14.65]I got it.
[78:14.97]Look at that house.
[78:23.38]That's worth a million.
[78:24.16]That'll be worth a million someday.
[78:37.54]A million of what?
[78:39.86]A million Reese's Pieces.
[78:42.56]So let's, uh... It's not done.
[78:45.92]Don't say it's bad until it's done.
[78:48.90]Just wait for my walk-in closet in my open kitchen.
[78:56.82]Just sayin'.
[79:36.96]I'm not even going to look at the chat.
[79:37.96]I don't even need to.
[79:41.34]Why would I need to look at it?
[79:42.12]I already know how to do this.
[79:44.18]I don't know how to play this.
[79:45.18]Guys, I think I'm moving forward.
[79:46.42]I think I'm going to have no chat.
[79:52.61]Yeah, I think... What do you think?
[80:00.23]Shit.
[80:04.07]Ugh!
[80:22.27]I mean, now I'm just playing Minecraft.
[80:28.50]This is what I do every time.
[80:30.20]Every single time I've ever opened this game.
[80:34.69]It goes the same way.
[80:38.95]No differences.
[80:39.77]This is the same house that I make.
[80:43.75]It's only just dirt on top.
[80:46.39]wood on the bottom, cobblestone on the sides.
[80:49.05]And then I put a door on, and then I go down and I look for diamonds.
[80:54.41]I've groundhog dayed this scenario probably 40 times.
[81:07.33]Only this time, I'm actually in it.
[81:09.48]I'm here right now.
[81:18.53]So like I said, a lot of the potential like this, some young kids here right now, made a reference to it before.
[81:27.96]I'm not that good.
[81:29.24]I'll make like a kitchen eventually here.
[81:34.20]But don't expect me to know how to do the lanterns or the electric stone cubes, redstone.
[81:45.19]I don't know how to do that.
[81:51.21]I'm out of stone.
[81:57.25]I'm actually out of stone.
[81:58.25]Alright.
[82:01.39]Now, I'm good to go for another adventure.
[82:03.93]I got meat.
[82:06.57]This is what I like to do.
[82:08.44]Hey, kids.
[82:10.30]This is how I do it.
[82:12.02]Find a corner of your house and turn it into the basement.
[82:15.54]And then the basement goes down into the mine.
[82:20.83]That's how I do it.
[82:24.17]So let's go over here.
[82:32.18]You know, I'm going to just take this off.
[82:34.86]This is not happening.
[82:38.97]I'm going to be honest with you.
[82:43.49]So for instance, now there's a front door.
[82:47.47]Open.
[82:48.47]Here we are.
[82:49.21]This leads down.
[82:50.15]It's going to go down like this.
[82:57.41]This is my basement.
[83:02.05]See, we're going to get some steps.
[83:03.29]A little bit more forward again.
[83:05.27]Another step.
[83:13.74]What is that?
[83:31.72]This is going to be paved.
[83:33.06]I'm going to pave that whole thing.
[83:43.33]There we go.
[83:43.97]One, two, three, four, five.
[83:49.99]Go down again.
[83:50.55]Make sure you bring enough light.
[83:57.93]I can take that one back.
[84:01.99]Alright, one more.
[84:04.55]Right?
[84:04.79]Are you following along?
[84:07.82]Are you following along here?
[84:09.26]There we go.
[84:23.38]What do you think?
[84:25.44]Too deep.
[84:26.12]Too deep.
[84:29.86]Keep torch in left hand.
[84:31.22]That's not a bad idea.
[84:42.27]ResidentSleeper.
[84:44.41]There's 31 torches in my hand?
[84:46.87]Holy shit.
[84:47.19]I didn't even know you could do that.
[84:57.22]Look.
[84:57.96]I lost a bet.
[84:58.64]That's why I'm here.
[85:02.45]I think that's good for now.
[85:04.81]This way.
[85:09.13]Gonna carve out a little section.
[85:10.99]A little more over here.
[85:18.66]How you doing?
[85:19.04]You sleepy yet?
[85:19.54]How you feeling?
[85:25.08]You okay?
[85:26.26]Got a headache?
[85:28.88]Got a running nose?
[85:30.10]I'm fucking sorry to hear that.
[85:31.66]Oh, sorry, I'm flippin' sorry to hear that.
[85:40.23]Alright, let's keep going.
[85:42.89]This is where it gets interesting, Ed.
[85:45.11]Uh, what, negative, like, 20 below?
[85:46.63]I didn't dig straight down.
[85:53.31]I... clearly came down a little staircase.
[86:01.68]Don't be afraid to say you like this and you're enjoying it.
[86:04.73]I am.
[86:05.43]This is fun.
[86:09.26]You know, I'm just talking shit, guys.
[86:11.32]That's all.
[86:15.01]Don't take anything I say seriously.
[86:16.31]I'm just kidding around.
[86:35.60]Okay.
[86:37.84]Actually, I won.
[86:40.54]I hear something.
[86:42.50]We're getting to a point where I need to get prepared with a sword.
[86:45.65]Is that a special song?
[87:02.94]Anything can be behind one of these doors.
[87:13.52]Is that this kind of stone?
[87:15.07]What is that?
[87:17.45]Granite.
[87:19.28]They had so many different cosmetic rocks.
[87:48.87]Can something happen?
[87:52.74]Stop.
[87:53.00]Calm down.
[87:53.62]Calm down.
[88:22.12]Where's my little seismograph meter?
[88:25.12]Don't I have one of those?
[88:26.98]Look up.
[88:38.89]Are those motorcycles in my room?
[88:40.87]I'm in VR.
[88:41.51]I can't tell.
[89:06.84]Damn it, I gotta get up there.
[89:14.88]Oh, shit.
[89:16.78]There's even more.
[89:28.40]I just realized something.
[89:31.67]This was not intentionally planned or anything, but the next game that I'm gonna play
[89:39.01]is having a realization about something.
[89:41.39]You'll see.
[89:41.69]Oh no, that was the thing breaking.
[89:53.35]Okay, how about... I feel like everyone might leave on the next game.
[90:06.41]Everybody came here because, like, oh, Minecraft VR, cool!
[90:09.06]I don't want to get lost down here.
[90:23.50]That wasn't more for breadcrumbs than anything else.
[90:29.81]Am I playing this on peaceful?
[90:33.03]No, it's on survival.
[90:37.45]At least it should be.
[90:38.19]I'm playing this on creative mode.
[90:47.87]Always get away and back up.
[90:49.09]Alright, we're getting deep.
[91:05.04]I hear running water.
[91:07.42]Right?
[91:08.28]I think I'm in the ocean right now.
[91:15.05]Is this bathroom tile?
[91:17.39]What is this?
[91:18.57]What kind of rock is that?
[91:22.89]Does it have a name?
[91:23.77]Got it.
[91:33.67]Okay.
[91:35.81]Oh, I was already down here.
[91:44.99]Alright.
[91:54.77]There was all kinds of shit.
[91:55.67]There's more of that, whatever the hell that is.
[92:05.04]God damn it.
[92:05.80]I tried.
[92:22.27]Light.
[92:22.75]I want more light.
[92:37.84]I'm going all the way down.
[92:55.53]Oh, we're fine.
[92:56.97]Can he come up here?
[93:07.84]I'll just farm him.
[93:08.54]Come on up.
[93:09.22]Was there a baby?
[93:12.07]There's a baby zombie!
[93:13.71]Where's the baby?
[93:25.51]Where'd the baby go?
[93:34.39]No, don't do that.
[93:37.91]Jesus.
[93:50.01]If I drop down there, I'm just gonna die.
[94:06.23]What?
[94:08.09]What the?
[94:08.81]Where?
[94:09.91]I'm so confused.
[94:11.35]What happened?
[94:17.39]Where?
[94:21.89]I just got... Nothing even hit me.
[94:37.73]Why am I wearing bathing shorts?
[94:39.41]That's not important.
[94:44.90]Say your letter, kid.
[94:54.36]Double cigar.
[95:01.79]Please think it was funny.
[95:02.57]Please think it was funny.
[95:03.29]Please think it was funny.
[95:03.97]Please think it was funny.
[95:04.65]Please think it was funny.
[95:15.46]Alright, I'll come back to that.
[95:32.72]Is it gone?
[95:33.60]Yeah.
[95:36.72]Made it out alive.
[95:37.48]Minecraft VR.
[95:39.54]Not even a problem.
[95:51.66]I can smell diamonds.
[95:52.68]I think I'm going to fall into a diamond pit right here.
[96:07.20]How can you tell when you're close to diamonds?
[96:08.46]Look at how we're getting deeper.
[96:23.52]Wow.
[96:34.72]Do those hurt you?
[96:35.30]Or are they just annoying?
[96:51.39]Found it!
[97:06.85]Oh my god, that was right in my face.
[97:23.77]Oh, no, it hurt.
[97:42.49]I don't know where... What happened?
[97:53.56]See, Minecraft is really just a horror game.
[97:57.58]In VR, it's just scary monsters around corners.
[98:01.17]Have I been here before?
[98:22.42]I don't think I've been down here before.
[98:29.66]That really did feel like I was playing, and somebody in chat was just spawning stuff in front of me.
[98:37.03]Like, I have Twitch enabled.
[98:39.73]And it says, spawn creeper now.
[98:56.07]I'll take more iron.
[98:57.15]I've missed a bunch of it too, it's been panicking.
[99:01.23]What is that?
[99:01.77]Oh.
[99:09.62]Sick.
[99:10.32]Okay.
[99:11.84]Might as well get it all.
[99:16.55]For one second I thought I was back in my basement, and I was like, how did that happen?
[99:28.87]Okay, where... I hear the music.
[99:38.16]That means I'm getting close, right?
[99:39.48]To something?
[99:41.28]Doesn't the music start, uh, trigger when you get near something cool?
[99:54.11]I'm going in too deep.
[99:59.91]I'm going in too deep.
[100:00.73]I have to stop.
[100:01.55]I don't know where I'm gonna end up.
[100:02.95]I'm gonna end up in a completely different place.
[100:09.46]I gotta go back.
[100:10.02]Did it keep going?
[100:13.30]I need to know where I am.
[100:15.02]I'm gonna be lost.
[100:16.43]Seriously, I have to put these everywhere, because I'll fucking forget.
[100:43.40]I'm not gonna live without you.
[100:44.32]No, I'm not.
[100:49.15]Anymore?
[100:49.93]Yeah, yeah, you're hiding on me.
[100:53.37]It's fine.
[100:53.75]Alright, I'm almost out of... I... I can't keep going.
[101:03.06]I'm almost out of power.
[101:14.64]Got it.
[101:19.24]Red stone.
[101:19.96]There it is.
[101:22.30]Now I can not know how to make anything because I have no idea.
[101:27.24]What's this?
[101:33.77]Blue stone.
[101:34.33]Alright.
[101:37.59]Where the fuck am I going?
[101:47.17]Bring it back.
[102:17.40]I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna take a piss and be right back.
[102:21.68]First rule, I know, I know.
[102:23.15]I only did it, I did it like three times.
[102:24.91]I haven't done that the entire game.
[102:29.79]I dug down three times.
[102:32.45]I didn't do that the other times.
[102:35.07]The one time that I do it.
[102:37.92]I do it like twice.
[102:39.20]Ugh.
[102:45.14]No, that's not even like...
[102:48.39]I'm fucking so stupid.
[102:51.31]I was down so deep, too.
[102:52.55]I should have known better.
[102:53.25]I haven't played, uh, whatever.
[102:55.85]Don't dig straight down.
[103:10.17]But it's different when you're, uh, I can't even give an excuse.
[103:18.22]I'll be right back.
[103:18.80]I'm gonna take a piss.
[103:20.35]Get some water in my face.
[103:22.03]Refill my cup after I drink it.
[103:24.87]There are literally shirts that say that.
[103:26.81]I know.
[103:29.95]I thought I had at least, like, one or two seconds to do it.
[103:34.94]Fucking hell.
[103:35.52]Whatever.
[103:36.28]I'll be right back.
[105:50.28]I can get back to it.
[105:50.98]My stuff is still okay, right?
[105:59.54]It burnt in the one square.
[106:05.15]It had to be the square right there, too.
[106:08.07]I'm so embarrassed.
[106:10.61]God damn it.
[106:12.67]Because that's like, okay... That happened to people...
[106:18.99]four or five years ago and that was like oh what don't dig down in Minecraft it's 2013. what's this guy burned because he fell down in a cube in Minecraft oh by the way no it's not 2011.
[106:47.70]It's 2019.
[106:48.44]Did somebody just give $100 right now?
[107:07.37]I just pulled my headset off and I'm looking at $100 from Cab Badger.
[107:13.46]That is a fantastic shirt, Jeremy.
[107:14.94]Where'd you get it?
[107:16.24]It was a gift.
[107:16.98]I actually don't know.
[107:24.33]But thank you, Cat Badger, for the $100.
[107:25.47]And JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[107:28.08]He can't say that now.
[107:28.96]Thank you for the community subs.
[107:36.70]Thank you.
[107:37.08]Yeah, it was gifted to me.
[107:40.44]Are we going to go swimming later?
[107:43.27]No.
[107:47.67]I even did the JermaCraft thing.
[107:49.63]Alright, one more thing.
[107:50.43]I just want one more try.
[107:51.27]I just want to get... Hold on.
[107:56.27]Let me just get it down.
[107:57.03]I'm going to do one more try and then we're going to move on.
[108:04.40]I'm so pissed off that that's how it ends.
[108:11.22]People are going to watch that clip and they're just going to be like... People are just going to shake their heads and be like, oh, well, good job.
[108:33.72]How many did I go down?
[108:35.02]How many did I go down?
[108:37.70]One, two, three, four, five... You guys let me do that six times?
[108:59.18]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[109:05.05]I can't believe I did that six times.
[109:07.54]I just got complacent.
[109:10.46]Where is this putting me?
[109:16.80]Your house is missing.
[109:19.38]Alright, is really every single solitary item burnt completely?
[109:26.88]Every single item is burnt in that one square.
[109:41.28]It's not even hard to get that shit.
[109:49.61]Oh, Tetris.
[110:01.71]No, it's really not.
[110:04.66]Plus, didn't I save something?
[110:05.92]I saved some stuff, didn't I?
[110:08.28]There it is.
[110:08.88]We're going back in there.
[110:18.17]I feel like I'm about to sell somebody a watch.
[110:22.81]Oh, let me see the diamond on that.
[110:24.59]Let's see.
[110:25.59]Well, it looks like it's gone through a little bit of erosion.
[110:32.34]Hold on. $250.
[110:45.69]I have a request.
[110:46.56]Lose the shorts.
[110:47.58]Alright.
[110:50.82]Alright, yeah.
[110:51.26]I just pulled it out of my fucking ear again.
[110:52.74]Alright, let's go.
[111:03.81]Something's pulling my hair.
[111:07.61]Alright, fuck it.
[111:15.48]Explain the shorts.
[111:16.39]There is no... Something is odd here.
[111:19.73]What is doing this?
[111:24.99]Alright.
[111:26.71]What do you mean?
[111:27.39]There is nothing to explain.
[111:28.39]I still can't believe you did that lava thing.
[111:36.70]Look, I still have iron.
[111:39.60]I can make a sword.
[111:40.34]Probably going to make a shovel.
[111:42.53]No, I'm going to make a sword.
[111:44.86]And then I can make... Everything's fine.
[111:46.17]Don't worry.
[111:51.77]Let's do it.
[111:53.85]That's why you make these.
[112:02.81]Not a total lie.
[112:03.37]Actually, it's probably for the best that that happened.
[112:11.50]I had so much trash.
[112:19.35]Alright, now, hmm, I need shovels.
[112:41.84]Where's the audio?
[112:49.86]I feel like I'm missing audio here.
[112:51.10]Okay.
[112:56.12]My torches.
[112:57.42]Fuck.
[112:59.92]All my torches are gone.
[113:14.04]That should be good.
[113:14.76]Maybe, uh, maybe, uh... No, I'll get some more.
[113:36.50]That's fine.
[113:37.88]64.
[113:37.92]Get the maximum.
[113:41.26]I'm going back in there.
[113:42.04]I don't have any food, but it's alright.
[113:50.57]What the hell?
[113:54.33]Oh.
[113:55.17]Alright, let's go.
[113:55.85]Are you ready?
[114:00.86]Back in there.
[114:01.90]Back to get something.
[114:03.54]Salvageable.
[114:10.50]We haven't seen a solo in stream juke for so long.
[114:14.50]Bring wood.
[114:16.40]What?
[114:16.64]Bring wood?
[114:17.28]I don't have any food.
[114:24.79]It's all gone.
[114:25.47]Alright, I guess I can just go kill something.
[114:36.27]I got a nice weapon here.
[114:46.08]I just need like a cow or something, right?
[115:05.03]Perfect.
[115:15.60]What's that?
[115:26.22]Okay, we're good.
[115:53.09]Don't kill it?
[115:54.17]How am I supposed to get food?
[115:58.09]I got plenty of food now.
[116:06.50]Food.
[116:06.83]12 o'clock.
[116:55.36]Okay.
[116:58.36]I'm not gonna drown.
[117:01.34]Now I'm gonna store this food, I'll cook some of it, and then it's time to go.
[117:04.20]How do I go faster?
[117:08.42]Okay, fishing.
[117:29.80]What the hell was that?
[117:31.15]Do they have, like, drowned zombies?
[117:42.19]Alright, that's good.
[117:49.76]Time to cook it.
[117:53.40]Back here.
[118:01.50]I'm going down there one more time.
[118:02.64]I'm gonna try to go down to where I was and then try to get diamonds.
[118:05.54]Right here.
[118:17.79]This is actually pretty fun.
[118:24.00]You're doing shots of tequila for me.
[118:26.54]Oh, that's right, it's St.
[118:27.44]Patrick's Day.
[118:31.84]I'm playing Minecraft.
[118:33.64]What are you doing?
[118:34.34]What are you doing on St.
[118:35.34]Paddy's Day?
[118:35.90]How are you?
[118:39.94]Bone meal.
[118:44.00]Raw salmon, raw cod.
[118:45.50]Alright, let's do, let's cook the chickens.
[118:50.74]Cook the chickens and eat the eggs.
[118:54.07]And I have two full chickens and two salmons.
[118:58.25]That sounds good to me.
[119:10.52]This is a sad song.
[119:21.81]Why would Sour Please be here?
[119:27.61]I'm gonna eat that egg.
[119:40.90]How do I eat the egg?
[119:46.62]It's raw?
[119:48.16]You can eat raw eggs in this game.
[119:49.64]I thought you could.
[120:01.71]I can't eat a raw egg?
[120:08.25]Says who?
[120:13.81]You don't eat eggs.
[120:14.69]And now I'm going to knock down one tree and get some wood in my inventory and then I'm going down there and that's it.
[120:26.73]Whatever happens down there, it's over.
[120:29.41]I didn't even build a whole damn house.
[120:32.29]It's an open floor plan, guys.
[120:37.44]Alright, let's get some wood.
[120:38.94]I'm going to eat this.
[120:39.62]Okay.
[120:45.64]Let's go get some wood.
[120:47.44]And then that's it.
[120:48.54]Time to go adventure again.
[120:50.58]Down to the hill.
[120:51.14]Alright.
[121:11.47]Let's go.
[121:26.72]Just in case I need it for anything.
[121:29.04]Alright, let's store this.
[121:35.69]I got a full chicken.
[121:37.33]I got plenty of food.
[121:38.93]Torches.
[121:40.21]Get this out of here.
[121:41.57]Get the rotten meat out of here.
[121:43.03]Kelp, get it out of here.
[121:44.96]Good.
[121:45.60]What's this?
[121:46.20]Bite wool.
[121:46.74]Don't need it.
[121:48.62]Here we go.
[121:58.89]See, I didn't do it here.
[121:59.89]I only did it in one fucking place.
[122:03.96]I got all this dug out.
[122:10.58]What?
[122:14.13]Oh, shit.
[122:17.95]How did I even manage to do this?
[122:38.21]Then I went down here, right?
[122:41.50]Let's get some more padding for this fall.
[122:51.79]Alright, I'm remembering.
[122:53.73]And then there was a big fight down here.
[122:55.67]I panicked.
[122:58.41]I ran that way.
[123:42.53]OK.
[124:07.25]I don't know where I went.
[124:18.82]I see an arrow.
[124:34.41]Where do I want to go back?
[124:38.33]Why do I want to go back?
[124:39.33]That's a really actually that's a great.
[124:45.23]New point to go from here.
[124:52.90]Perfect.
[125:00.58]Build the inventory back up.
[125:10.22]This way, that way.
[125:11.42]Let's just keep going across.
[125:13.63]So I'm down pretty deep.
[125:17.49]Maybe I should put a bed down here.
[125:31.71]No, just keep progressing.
[125:32.85]I'm gonna go down.
[125:48.35]I'll do that again.
[126:09.38]That shit's not gonna happen more than once.
[126:11.04]Hello?
[126:32.69]Uh, okay.
[126:36.04]Does that mean something?
[126:43.66]What does that mean?
[127:03.23]I'm not going to get Mr. X'd in this, right?
[127:15.75]You wondering why I brought so many tools?
[127:18.39]This is why.
[127:18.93]When do I get to the... I've got to be close to getting to the bottom of the world here.
[127:40.25]What cube is the bottom of the world?
[127:41.41]Like cube 300, right?
[127:48.56]It's like 320 or something.
[128:29.53]It's going so deep First of all, I'm I need to like I'm about that I can see there's a wall right there There's iron Thankfully I made it I'm at the bottom of the world
[129:04.77]Yeah, you can't dig through this, right?
[129:16.86]I don't have an iron pickaxe.
[129:19.84]Fuck.
[129:22.88]Smelt the iron?
[129:23.62]Alright, yeah.

[129:28.57]Okay.

[131:11.44]I'm going to do a helmet.
[131:14.12]Or a shield.
[131:15.04]How do I make a shield?
[131:21.02]I've never seen that before.
[131:22.01]I've never made one.
[131:24.43]The shield is ten shovels.
[131:33.91]Ten above bedrock.
[131:36.49]Just open the green book.
[131:39.31]Ooh, isn't that fancy?
[131:44.95]So it's planks and then an iron bar.
[131:50.25]Okay, let's make it.
[132:15.50]Okay, shield.

[133:11.23]This... Shield?
[133:14.21]This is a cutting board.
[133:19.42]Is this a stamp?
[133:20.76]What?
[133:23.38]How am I supposed to hold it like this?
[133:24.80]I feel like this is an old-fashioned flash photography bulb.
[133:34.84]Feel like... Alright.
[133:42.55]That's pretty cool.
[133:44.53]Put these torches back.
[133:47.31]And...
[133:49.97]I'm good.
[133:50.93]Get the shovel down there.
[133:51.93]I'm ready.
[133:54.22]I'm ready.
[133:56.94]I think I'm ready.
[133:57.46]Am I ready?
[133:59.94]Block arrows with the shield.
[134:02.04]Nice.
[134:03.98]Make an iron bow.
[134:05.28]God damn it, is what they said.
[134:10.47]I can't.
[134:10.81]I don't have enough.
[134:13.65]I don't have enough.
[134:14.29]I can't do it.
[134:17.71]Shears or Flint and steel?
[134:20.75]It's not real.
[134:24.75]Nah, they're all gone.
[134:26.69]I'm ready.
[134:27.01]I got chicken, I got my sword.
[134:29.86]Except this blocks my whole inventory.
[134:31.24]Alright, I'm ready for Minecon!
[134:50.89]No.
[134:59.64]What's the chance that there's lava in here?
[135:02.45]It's pretty high, right?
[135:07.41]No, get me the fuck out of here.
[135:09.45]Get me out of this.
[135:10.39]I'm not doing this.
[135:38.02]Okay, safe.
[135:43.82]Ugh.
[135:46.06]Alright.
[135:47.20]I'm good.
[135:49.00]Let's get the hell out of here.
[135:50.43]I'm gonna go, like, up that way.
[136:02.25]Oh, goddammit.
[136:06.67]Okay.
[136:06.81]Okay.
[136:10.06]Um... I'm gonna poke a hole in the walls, and I'm so paranoid about lava now after that happening before.
[136:17.04]I'm just gonna stand up and like poke fucking holes in the walls.
[136:23.95]Clear a nice section here.
[136:27.57]I'm also not gonna use this.
[136:30.69]For just this bullshit.
[136:31.91]I'm gonna use this.
[136:32.57]It's a waste of resources.
[136:46.59]Alright, let's switch back.
[136:50.53]Nice.
[136:58.14]What can I do with this stuff?
[137:00.68]Not like it matters.
[137:01.42]I'm not gonna spend, like, all day in here.
[137:38.27]Don't do that either.
[137:40.30]Right, that's bad too.
[137:41.24]That's just as bad as going down.
[138:06.20]What's going on up there?
[138:07.93]Nothing?
[138:08.25]Okay, it's safe.
[138:13.58]Kind of, kind of safe.
[138:42.76]Alright, I'm on the diamond level, right?
[138:57.67]I'm here.
[138:59.75]What the fuck was that?
[139:02.89]What the hell just... Is that ASCII in 2019?
[139:12.06]Have we got Justin TV?
[139:14.06]Oh, is it Justin.TV or are we Twitch now?
[139:21.66]Okay, I'm ready.
[139:22.56]I'm gonna go this way.
[139:32.39]I'm at the diamond level.
[139:34.27]This is all I need.
[139:34.91]This is all I want.
[139:35.47]I just want to get it and I want to make a diamond sword and a diamond pickaxe and that's it.
[139:39.83]And then I'm done.
[139:43.56]And then I can say I've done it all.
[139:46.01]I've done it all.
[139:47.29]I've traveled to Japan.
[139:50.95]I've been to France.
[139:54.11]I fucking have a giant empire of merchandising, right?
[139:58.90]I sold like fucking 422 shirts.
[140:01.92]Empire.
[140:03.78]I played Minecraft VR, got diamonds.
[140:13.69]It's more than that, by the way.
[140:19.03]No, wrong.
[140:27.77]Can you imagine running a fucking empire clothing company?
[140:33.39]What's your day-to-day life like?
[140:39.44]Do you, like, hold up shirts and you're like, nah, this sucks, and you, like, tell them to start over?
[140:56.43]Come on, Minecraft.
[140:57.46]Where the hell are the diamonds?
[141:26.39]Press F3 and see if you are at level 16 or below.
[141:28.97]I can't do that right now.
[141:45.47]Iron.
[141:45.79]Might be able to make some more stuff.
[141:48.37]Maybe a blouse.
[141:50.03]Maybe a t-shirt.
[142:02.51]Is that it for... Give me like a diamond patch.
[142:12.99]That's all I want.
[142:13.77]I don't care.
[142:14.65]I don't even know how to get back to my house.
[142:18.34]You think I care about what's going on at my residence right now?
[142:26.00]No, that wasn't even a house.
[142:28.60]This is weird.
[142:29.22]Why is this here?
[142:31.40]This is dirt.
[142:47.45]Okay, I got a straight shot.
[143:00.08]Is dirt this low?
[143:47.66]Okay.
[143:49.30]I think we're good.
[144:06.17]I'm so confused as to why this is here.
[144:07.51]Oh my god, eat?
[144:14.80]Eat?
[144:24.44]Eat.
[144:24.58]Eat.
[144:25.20]Eat.
[144:25.36]That was pretty good.
[144:40.15]Yeah!
[145:04.57]President sleeper.
[145:06.39]What is this?
[145:08.05]Why does that look different?
[145:16.86]I'm out of here.
[145:17.98]I'm done.
[145:18.30]I'm just gonna do it.
[145:20.06]I'm just gonna melt it right now.
[145:22.76]I'm not waiting.
[145:26.62]There are eight diamonds.
[145:28.62]Look at those diamond eggs.
[145:35.78]And I need... Put that down.
[145:40.46]64 redstone.
[145:47.57]Put it in there.
[145:56.09]Diamond axe.
[145:58.34]That's not what I want.
[145:59.38]Diamond pickaxe.
[146:04.10]Got it.
[146:05.08]There it is.
[146:06.98]Diamond sword.
[146:17.49]Diamond hoe.
[146:24.68]There it is.
[146:28.74]It's your beauty.
[146:37.44]Yeah, everyone's talking shit.
[146:38.40]You're talking shit about my fucking gonzo blade.
[146:57.64]Alright, I beat Minecraft.
[146:58.80]That was fun.
[147:10.67]I didn't get, like, I didn't use my diamond sword, though.
[147:13.67]I can't just not, I can't just give up now.
[147:16.90]Diamond sword.
[147:19.40]Look at how fast it is.
[147:21.48]What about in real time?
[147:25.54]Way better.
[147:41.28]You gotta be close, though.
[147:42.06]That's the only thing.
[147:51.40]In before lava.
[147:55.75]I'm in a decent position.
[147:57.29]I can just run that way.
[147:58.01]I want to find a cave system.
[148:23.12]Nope.
[148:23.76]It's just dark.
[148:28.88]This is really fun, though.
[148:33.35]It's just a whole other way to experience playing this game.
[148:38.43]In three dimensions.
[148:46.47]Uh, what's that?
[148:46.97]Houston.
[148:48.39]We've got a cave.
[148:50.67]Where is it?
[148:55.03]Was it this way?
[149:10.06]So one person said yes.
[149:14.28]I'll listen to you.
[149:14.80]I have to heal.
[149:19.08]I got full health, let me tell everyone.
[149:29.82]Wasn't I only supposed to play this for an hour?
[149:32.82]Well, I did have to get diamonds.
[149:42.20]How long have I been playing this?
[149:43.78]Did I just lose track of all time?
[149:45.31]It's almost three hours?
[149:52.79]Holy shit.
[149:55.67]I'm- I- That's mean I'm enjoying myself.
[150:03.87]I'm going to have to wake up a little bit though for the next game that's coming up here in a minute once I find anything.
[150:22.57]Is it?
[150:23.73]Is it?
[150:25.67]No, I'm safe.
[150:26.25]I'm safe.
[150:26.69]It's fine.
[150:29.34]Everything's fine.
[150:32.00]It's right here.
[150:32.66]It's this block right here.
[150:36.62]Come on, kid.
[150:38.18]We gotta get out of here.
[150:41.21]What does Indiana Jones say?
[150:43.93]I'm surrounded by lava.
[150:48.84]It's all here.
[151:26.06]Good thing.
[151:28.36]Good thing.
[151:38.80]I think it's actually up there.
[151:39.78]Stop.
[151:47.18]I hear noises.
[151:48.72]I can hear skeletons and shit.
[151:56.70]Where are they?
[152:15.08]There's lava somewhere over here.
[152:18.50]It might be in like three or four different places.
[152:19.96]I think they're above me.
[152:22.37]There's something above me.
[152:23.15]Alright, I'm in a safe place.
[152:39.52]That would have been fucking really bad.
[152:51.55]Where are these people?
[153:22.54]To the right.
[153:44.89]Ooh!
[153:49.73]Okay.
[153:51.38]Found it.
[154:05.67]How big is this?
[154:31.67]This is going to lead to a much bigger system, right?
[154:33.61]The lava's flowing this way.
[154:36.33]Does that mean anything?
[154:47.53]What?
[155:02.31]Oh, it is still here.
[155:03.61]Okay.
[155:10.91]I'm playing with fire here.
[155:12.07]Like, actually.
[155:16.60]Am I trying to make this hard on myself?
[155:28.50]Funny light.
[155:39.97]Come on, give me- Leave me somewhere!
[155:43.04]Leave me somewhere!
[155:45.80]It ends!
[156:02.44]I'm getting out of here.
[156:03.08]I have to leave.
[156:04.14]I gotta- I'm leaving.
[156:13.26]How on Earth am I going to navigate my way out of here?
[156:24.05]I'm not going to dig up into lava.
[156:26.93]If I do, I can make a run for it.
[156:28.57]That looks alright.
[156:42.31]We're safe.
[156:44.23]We're safe for now.
[156:53.94]Oh, come on.
[156:54.80]Give me something.
[156:55.52]I hear water.
[157:03.29]I don't think I want that to happen.
[157:05.15]I might just turn around and go the other way.
[157:15.44]This means that they're waterlogged, right?
[157:17.46]Okay, safe.
[157:35.10]Safe, let's keep looking.
[157:38.48]There's a spider.
[157:39.04]That means that there has to be land.
[157:41.68]Where's the spider?
[157:50.75]Over here.
[158:08.83]Something going on up there.
[158:17.87]Water?
[158:18.63]Is there water up there?
[158:31.97]I still have a spider.
[158:38.40]I should be fine.
[158:54.56]Alright, this... Oh my god!
[159:00.18]Get rid of this!
[159:02.94]I have so much cobblestone.
[159:04.59]It's like someone hasn't been paying attention, right?
[159:22.59]Something up here.
[160:09.35]I'm gonna open up and there's gonna be just a window of somebody's face.
[160:11.91]This might be water right here.
[160:18.15]I actually have to be very careful about this.
[160:24.57]Did I just punch somebody?
[160:49.81]I'm very confused.
[160:50.63]I don't hear anything.
[161:04.01]They were right here.
[161:05.17]It was almost like I was standing right in front of them.
[161:23.52]Uh, anybody got any ideas?
[161:24.74]Alright, no, I gotta stop fucking around.
[161:32.97]I gotta go.
[161:33.75]Time to go up.
[161:35.17]We're just going up.
[161:36.81]If I die, I die.
[161:37.79]It's alright.
[161:54.26]I'm over a cave, somehow.
[161:59.65]I should have enough time to run into something horrible right there.
[162:01.83]Okay.
[162:15.91]Oh.
[162:31.71]I ain't even dealing with you at all.
[162:49.60]What are you doing?
[163:08.24]Can I just sneak around them?
[163:09.88]I mean, I know there's... I don't know what I'm stepping on.
[163:30.83]Um, no.
[163:36.81]I can just go all the way around them.
[163:46.00]They cannot fit through that.
[163:50.64]There's not somebody behind me.
[163:53.85]You have to be right here.
[163:54.91]Fuck, he's like right in front of my face.
[164:51.13]Jesus.
[165:07.16]It's a goddamn diamond pit gas.
[165:08.60]What's this thing even worth?
[165:24.04]Come on.
[165:31.50]Get down here.
[165:44.43]What the fuck are they all doing here?
[165:46.75]What the fuck are you doing here?
[165:52.48]There's one of those spawners up here, ain't there?
[165:54.14]I gotta eat.
[165:55.44]Do I have any more food?
[166:04.35]This sucks.
[166:06.99]Okay, there's a bow and arrow.
[166:23.21]Why did that not block it?!
[166:33.15]Why did that not block?!
[166:35.69]It went through the shield!
[166:38.86]I'm gonna die, I need to eat again.
[166:40.04]What happened to my food?
[166:49.64]How do I throw these away?
[166:52.64]I don't want them in here.
[167:03.50]No!
[167:08.00]Don't touch, don't.
[167:52.37]I made it.
[167:53.03]I think I've been here.
[167:56.67]Have I been here before?
[167:57.51]I don't think... No, I haven't.
[168:05.06]I think there's another one.
[168:20.19]Oh, sh...
[168:44.33]No, not deep.
[168:44.97]I don't want to go deeper.
[168:46.03]Oh my god, this looks like... This looks man-made.
[169:01.56]This looks man-made.
[169:03.32]I think this is man-made.
[169:07.05]It's man-made.
[169:10.43]Is that man-made?
[169:51.72]What?
[169:53.34]There's no more lava to worry about down here.
[170:04.94]I'll be fine.
[170:20.80]Almost there, almost there, then I can be done.
[170:32.45]Water.
[170:48.89]Get down!
[171:01.61]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[171:16.24]I'm fine.
[171:17.86]I have no idea what's going on with the back of my head.
[171:21.40]What happened?
[171:25.55]What is this?
[171:26.09]Why is it doing this?
[171:39.30]I'm cheating right now with my left eye.
[171:45.05]What's going on?
[171:57.24]Is this going down?
[171:58.42]What's this connected to?
[172:15.85]The cord is all the way up here.
[172:24.18]What the fuck?
[172:29.34]Look at this mess.
[172:30.10]How am I going to get rid of this?
[172:38.40]It was yanking me on the back of the head.
[172:40.30]Oh, this is going to take like 20 minutes to get out of this.
[172:49.78]I've been spinning around that much?
[173:00.21]What was that?
[173:02.59]What was that?
[173:03.09]Why did my house just fall down?
[173:06.51]What was that, like, crashing wood sound?
[173:10.11]Where am I?
[173:21.90]Did I pull a cord out?
[173:22.90]I think I may have pulled a cord out.
[173:38.27]OK.
[173:55.99]Oh my lord, there's real tension here.
[174:01.47]I have to, I have to fix that before we play another game.
[174:04.61]Alright, what the hell happened?
[174:09.99]Why am I, why is it just black?
[174:12.13]Am I a lot?
[174:25.90]I was inside the wall.
[174:27.32]Okay, let's go back up.
[174:41.24]Am I dying?
[174:55.95]Come on, go.
[174:56.63]Get up there.
[175:12.50]Oh, no!
[175:16.28]Where's my house?
[175:18.04]What's one of the four horsemen doing here?
[175:20.48]What?
[175:45.08]What is that?
[175:53.84]That's rare?
[175:57.20]What the fuck?
[176:00.50]Should I like go back and kill it?
[176:08.71]It's split into... I don't even know where this is.
[176:14.51]Alright, hold on.
[176:14.95]Let me take a look for a second.
[176:18.37]So, that's the Creeper Island.
[176:20.41]Is it that way?
[176:25.80]I don't know where my house is.
[176:46.02]Where the hell was that?
[176:51.89]I think it was back here?
[177:01.02]Down there.
[177:19.57]There he is.
[177:19.91]There he is.
[177:20.35]There they are.
[177:21.13]There they are.
[177:21.53]What do I do about this?
[177:22.17]How do I do this?
[177:24.65]Okay, I'm gonna... What do I do?
[177:45.48]Run, grab stuff, and then leave.
[177:48.44]I've got a diamond sword.
[177:50.67]I have to at least try.
[177:52.17]Are there four of them?
[178:02.47]What is he wearing on his head?
[178:06.45]What?
[178:08.11]There's a giant sea turtle?
[178:09.65]Hello.
[178:17.97]You can ride his back, can't you?
[178:20.77]Of course you can.
[178:21.33]No you can't.
[178:32.16]Where's my stuff?
[179:18.34]You can't go in water, right?
[179:19.24]Yeah, you can.
[179:24.62]Come on, you son of a bitch, let's go!
[179:26.66]You get everything?
[179:35.49]Most of it.
[179:37.31]Oh, shit!
[179:59.93]Damn.
[180:01.35]Gotta kill fish and eat.
[180:14.78]Come here.
[180:21.31]Should I go for that guy?
[180:22.35]Should I try to kill him?
[180:25.37]If I have full health and it's just one, can I just bash his head in?
[180:47.44]I need more fish.
[180:49.02]I'm going for them.
[180:54.67]Maybe if it's only one.
[180:57.93]Oh fuck, that's one of them.
[181:04.95]Alright, give me some more food.
[181:11.92]My eyes are being blocked by my hair.
[181:22.11]I don't think I have one of those damn things.
[181:24.06]No, what are you doing?
[181:50.81]Give me the food.
[181:51.65]I want the food.
[181:59.64]Okay.
[182:02.16]Ah!
[182:02.28]I'm going to start healing now, right?
[182:06.34]Good.
[182:07.83]I'm going to go after the one that's over here.
[182:11.19]I feel like I can do it.
[182:14.79]Because there was like four of them at the same time.
[182:16.97]So that's why I couldn't do anything about it before.
[182:18.57]Let me get some more food.
[182:27.24]for.
[183:07.62]Oh my god, I'm just hungry.
[183:09.12]I'm starving the whole time.
[183:10.22]No!
[183:27.15]Give it!
[183:34.78]Am I supposed to go make this food?
[183:41.50]I'm wasting so much time.
[183:47.90]They'll be there.
[183:48.36]Let's see if I can get this little school of fish.
[184:09.83]Got three.
[184:10.19]Okay, I'm good.
[184:13.93]Fuck it, whatever.
[184:14.55]Just go.
[184:16.13]Back home.
[184:17.77]Store the other shit that I have.
[184:25.69]Hey look, I got another one.
[184:27.59]Didn't even need to do anything.
[184:34.37]This makes me want to pick up Minecraft again.
[184:35.99]Good way to de-stress.
[184:41.56]Yeah, no, this is fun.
[184:44.00]Get it.
[184:44.46]Don't look.
[184:44.82]Just sit there.
[184:48.40]I would have moved on already.
[184:51.07]But I don't know.
[184:51.73]I'm just... If I'm going to do it, might as well just do it.
[184:56.91]Spend at least a few hours in here.
[185:02.25]Seems like they added a lot of interesting stuff.
[185:04.99]That's the coolest part.
[185:06.15]Am I even talking?
[185:07.19]I am.
[185:08.17]Weirdly enough, I'm talking right in the right direction.
[185:12.71]The last time I really gave any care at all about this game had to have been at least four or five years ago.
[185:20.61]And I really wasn't into it that much anyways.
[185:23.63]But coming back after all these years, hold that thought.
[185:27.02]There it goes.
[185:29.76]Coming back after all the years, it just seems like the sea turtles in the game, that's odd.
[185:36.32]That's equally parts interesting and like, wow, I'm surprised that they're still adding content to the game.
[185:41.84]Alright, where's my house?
[185:45.28]There it is.
[185:49.44]This many years later.
[185:55.26]Is this a coffee pasta?
[186:03.97]It is now.
[186:04.47]Alright, hold on.
[186:17.47]Three hours in Minecraft.
[186:21.31]I'm surprised.
[186:21.95]Alright, let me just fix this.
[186:24.62]I'll go try to kill him and then we'll move on after that.
[186:27.36]Let's eat.
[186:34.10]Get my shit together.
[186:35.38]And I'm just gonna go... What happened to my hand?
[186:38.51]Oh.
[186:38.97]Alright.
[186:43.87]Food.
[186:44.35]I still got the shield still.
[186:48.86]I can make some more armor, which is good.
[186:52.90]I don't think I have any... No, god damn it.
[186:59.78]I don't have any, uh... Anything to make... to burn this oak.
[187:05.12]I'm gonna have to use my, like, trees.
[187:07.20]I have wood, yeah.
[187:12.16]I don't have very much of it, though.
[187:25.79]I need to make... Look, I have 23 iron ore.
[187:29.24]I might as well just get decked out.
[187:36.00]Are they gonna despawn in this?
[187:37.30]Do I have to run back there quick?
[187:46.51]They do, so I gotta get the hell back there.
[187:48.31]I don't have time then.
[187:51.75]Just put on... I got my clothes on, right?
[187:53.33]I just gotta go over there and start whacking them.
[188:02.61]My shield.
[188:03.21]Put it on.
[188:05.93]Alright, here we go.
[188:15.76]Armor.
[188:16.94]No time.
[188:17.46]There's no time.
[188:19.24]He's there.
[188:19.76]They despawned.
[188:23.36]One right there.
[188:24.34]One right there.
[188:24.92]I think there's another one.
[188:26.13]Let me get a better view.
[188:38.70]I'm gonna go for this one.
[188:42.66]What was that?
[188:45.16]What is that?
[188:45.54]An Enderman.
[188:49.62]Right.
[189:08.53]Don't you look at them.
[189:09.79]I wasn't I looking at him.

[189:15.53]It's one of those two You don't look I thought you were supposed to look Right.

[189:24.34]Alright you Is he still gonna be up there

[189:45.81]I have an arrow in the back of my head.

[190:08.59]Just twice.
[190:09.15]I don't care.
[190:17.45]Whatever happens.
[190:18.56]Whatever happens, happens.
[190:19.41]I'm going in.

[196:18.95]I don't need to explain it.
[196:24.19]I gotta use the shield.
[196:25.03]When I used the shield last time, it just fucking killed me.

[206:28.86]No!
[206:29.10]No!
[206:34.76]It's so dark.
[206:38.96]Oh my God, I hate this thing.
[206:41.70]Get better goddamn technology for Christ's sake.
[206:44.00]It's because I'm putting my hand over my head because I'm blind when I go like this.
[206:57.54]Is he in?
[207:02.81]Is he in?
[207:03.41]I can't tell.
[207:10.28]No, he's not.
[207:12.14]The horse is dead.
[207:13.04]What?
[207:14.32]What do you mean the horse is friendly?
[207:17.26]What do you mean he's dead?
[207:21.68]The rider is dead.
[207:26.36]So I can... Horse is not harmful.
[207:37.79]You sure?
[207:38.27]Oh man, are you sure about that?
[207:41.73]So what do I do?
[207:42.67]What can I do?
[207:43.03]Oh wow, what can I- What happened?
[207:53.12]What happened?
[208:01.00]What happened again?
[208:01.78]Fucking goddamn bed of technology, I swear to god.
[208:06.84]What happened?
[208:08.41]I can't even, I didn't touch anything.
[208:11.65]How would I suffocate in a wall?
[208:14.16]I didn't do anything.
[208:15.34]What happened?
[208:16.52]I gotta get back here now.
[208:17.40]Why can I not touch any fucking thing on the screen?
[208:19.50]What?
[208:20.28]Why did it minimize the window?
[208:30.58]I'm getting this fucking lobster, whatever it is, quickly.
[208:34.24]Where is, where is, this way?
[209:01.83]Don't care.
[209:07.76]He's going to get back over here.
[209:09.04]He's still there.
[209:09.64]We're fine.
[209:10.14]Slow down.
[209:16.08]You guys are still questioning his sanity.
[209:19.76]So what can I do with this animal?
[209:22.35]So, okay, I have... Do I, like, touch him?
[209:26.85]Can I pet him?
[209:27.71]How do I do this?
[209:30.99]Tame it.
[209:33.25]Break the blocks.
[209:36.01]I need a saddle.
[209:41.74]Break roof.
[209:45.28]Break all the blocks.
[209:46.30]They are tame.
[209:46.98]Need a saddle.
[209:48.54]Break the blocks above him.
[209:51.74]Like up here.
[210:01.37]I don't need a saddle.
[210:05.75]Oh, that's so much information.
[210:10.70]Touch him with an empty hand.
[210:13.62]The dirt blocks.
[210:16.64]That's wood, like these.
[210:22.58]Why do I need to get rid of those?
[210:23.88]What's he doing?
[210:30.30]Now ride it.
[210:38.33]What?
[210:45.45]Does he have a mind of his own?
[210:46.33]I don't even have any items.
[210:51.09]I can't get out of here.
[210:55.64]What about my... What?
[211:00.36]No, no, no, no.
[211:01.00]Don't do that again.
[211:02.10]This way.
[211:02.66]Out here.
[211:04.14]Wait, how do I get off?
[211:07.04]Grab your shit.
[211:07.54]How do I jump off?
[211:08.12]How do you get off?
[211:15.08]Jump.
[211:15.92]I can't jump.
[211:17.94]I can't get off of him.
[211:22.86]Left shift.
[211:23.64]Okay, I got my sword.
[211:27.71]Okay, I'm ready.
[211:34.51]So where do we go?
[211:40.75]That, I almost threw up from that.
[211:43.63]I almost just fell down.
[211:52.83]How do I tell him to go?
[211:58.47]Go!
[212:00.43]Go!
[212:00.67]I need a saddle.
[212:12.53]What is going on with the world?
[212:20.59]Oh, stop doing that.
[212:28.69]Alright, do something.
[212:31.11]Do it.
[212:31.59]Can I?
[212:33.37]Will he go anywhere?
[212:34.15]Now you're going to leave.
[212:40.50]You're a real.
[212:40.96]I was pointing at him.
[212:57.56]What happened to that guy?
[213:08.52]Alright, I need a saddle.
[213:10.18]Where's the crafting book?
[213:13.26]Saddle.
[213:16.74]How do I get him to come with me?
[213:17.76]Will he come with me?
[213:20.93]I craft a lead and take him home.
[213:28.19]Oh.
[213:30.87]You have to find the saddle.
[213:34.43]Oh.
[213:37.11]Well, this is cool.
[213:45.12]At least I got to see it.
[213:49.96]Bye.
[213:50.98]Be free.
[213:54.50]Just spawn a cell.
[214:01.24]Pet the turtle.
[214:05.96]That was outrageous.
[214:06.74]Look, there's another one.
[214:11.64]Well, that was cool.
[214:13.66]I gotta take a break.
[214:14.84]I gotta go get... I gotta go get a fucking drink.
[214:19.88]That last 30 minutes kind of just killed me.
[214:24.33]I'm gonna grab a drink.
[214:26.93]I'll be right back.
[214:28.15]Water.
[214:29.57]And I'm not even talking in the right direction.
[214:33.66]That's the rarest horse in the game.
[214:36.60]At least I got to ride it.
[214:39.90]I got to ride it for at least a second.
[214:41.66]I got to put the coin in in front of the fucking Walmart.
[214:43.99]Alright, I'll be right back.
[214:47.39]We'll do another one.
