[00:01.46]Kenshi.
[00:04.24]So I hope you enjoyed that preload to the stream.
[00:07.50]Except I don't think anybody did.
[00:08.56]I don't know.
[00:12.86]Turn on the vocoder, the audio tuner for Kenshi.
[00:27.10]I don't think I can even do that.
[00:30.17]I don't think that's even possible, guys.
[00:35.23]That requires... That requires like an audio engineer to be on site.
[00:42.91]And I have to explain to Kim later.
[00:45.21]I should probably just do it now.
[00:51.64]She just heard me through the wall talking about how I was gonna eat people's bones and like fucking murder them and shit.
[00:55.60]She's probably like, is it a bad stream?
[00:58.24]Oh man.
[01:00.21]Is like chat being mean and he's gonna eat them?
[01:03.57]Is it really bad?
[01:05.03]It's got that bad?
[01:07.47]Oh, I need to, by the way, speaking of loud noises, I gotta turn this back on.
[01:15.25]Cause my compressor is now off.
[01:17.31]Now it's on.
[01:18.77]Would you look at that?
[01:22.68]So now it shouldn't sound as awful, especially when I get loud and it should be a little louder.
[01:35.29]so loud well and I can change that don't worry that's probably better is it better I'm gonna I'm gonna go a little loud here whoa it's probably better good it's good okay alright alright so we're taking the frog crew into Kenshi welcome back everybody the last I don't know what any of these mean does anybody know what these are
[02:06.70]Working Auto save quick save get the book LUL debated can I get away post attack Vegas odds encounter a new beginning real timeline It's just the top one, right?
[02:20.89]Eighty one hundred bucks.
[02:25.39]Oh Does he remember any of this no I don't not at all I
[02:36.00]What happened last time?
[02:36.68]I did buy a house last time.
[02:39.00]The house was purchased.
[02:45.64]What am I sipping on?
[02:46.32]It's just coffee.
[02:48.47]It's just regular, just right out of the coffee maker coffee.
[02:54.19]Nothing in it.
[02:56.11]Can you see?
[03:00.69]Level one tadpole.
[03:08.04]But if you're still here and you just wanted to see a guy act like a dickhead for like an hour, well, welcome.
[03:15.42]Thanks for sticking around.
[03:17.18]This is an interesting, hold on.
[03:19.04]This is an interesting game.
[03:21.82]This is an example of Speaks, an audio compressive software.
[03:25.40]This is an example of Speaks, an audio, you know what I mean?
[03:28.42]Like, stay here.
[03:38.67]The one thing that I have to remember, though, is I gotta remember, like, the basic controls, because it has been, like, a week and a half.
[03:45.01]Put war.
[03:46.49]War!
[03:47.43]No.
[03:48.07]Alright, we got, uh, Chatham, Adam Sandler.
[03:50.95]Just to give you a reminder of who everybody is.
[03:55.86]Frog, uh, Musk, Massamoon, and Canroth.
[03:59.22]Canroth is currently working on some projects over here, and everyone's in the right spot, right?
[04:05.34]8,100 bucks.
[04:06.78]This is my house that I just bought.
[04:09.84]Show Chatham's face.
[04:11.82]Why is everybody gathering out here?
[04:17.58]No, wait.
[04:18.78]Don't do the... I... What is going on?
[04:33.24]Why is this guy mind-controlling every single person here?
[04:38.56]Is this a bad?
[04:39.62]Oh, it's abandoned.
[04:40.77]It's abandoned.
[04:41.43]Why are they just letting him walk around?
[04:42.61]I have no idea.
[04:47.75]Alright.
[04:48.51]So, let's take a look at the map.
[04:50.67]This is the current home.
[04:51.71]We need to do... I did an expedition out here with everybody.
[04:55.61]Where do I have food?
[04:57.87]Because that's going to mean a lot.
[05:01.07]We've got... Actually, I've got plenty of food here.
[05:04.47]What is a...
[05:07.60]Okay.
[05:08.28]So, you got all the food.
[05:09.28]Five dried meats.
[05:11.21]Four food cubes.
[05:16.25]What is this?
[05:19.23]Why do I not just put this on?
[05:20.25]Who needs armor?
[05:22.34]Well, frog was gonna stay here.
[05:23.68]Although, I'm gonna give the grog to... Let's give the grog.
[05:29.98]I need to trade.
[05:33.34]Because this thing's worth a lot of fucking money.
[05:34.57]So, let's get that over here.
[05:38.61]Oh, I was training people in the training dummies.
[05:41.42]Okay, that's the last thing that was happening.
[05:43.86]So, we got attack minus four.
[05:47.74]So, this Kandroth sucks.
[05:51.44]Chatham, Adam, Sandler, I believe, can still practice, right?
[05:56.21]Yeah, okay.
[05:57.81]So, you need everybody to get to, like, plus five.
[06:02.05]The dog can't do anything.
[06:04.27]Frog Musk is just kind of standing around.
[06:09.20]I forgot just how fucking ugly everybody was.
[06:13.34]So I want to do an expedition.
[06:14.28]I have... I'm going to bring Candroth, the dog, and Frogmusk.
[06:19.90]No, no, no, no.
[06:20.54]She's the one that needs to come with it.
[06:22.25]She's the one that has any training.
[06:25.55]Who can just go out and do something stupid?
[06:27.05]Frogmusk maybe should just go somewhere.
[06:30.51]This is lockpicking training.
[06:33.89]Slaughter the dog.
[06:34.74]Why would I do something like that?
[06:37.30]Although I do need to do this, though.
[06:38.74]Because this is kind of low on volume.
[06:42.48]Okay.
[06:50.66]Yeah, unequipped bags.
[06:52.18]I need a storage unit.
[06:57.11]Defense 5 plus 3.
[07:00.13]Everybody's healthy, right?
[07:03.53]Well, not really.
[07:05.47]Need to bandage you.
[07:07.03]Let's speed it up.
[07:12.12]Holy shit, this is taking like a full two days.
[07:20.04]Put your camera in the window?
[07:22.22]Yeah, I could do that.
[07:34.05]So I'm part of the team.
[07:35.17]Alright.
[07:41.91]Yeah, we're at a boring part of the game right now.
[07:44.09]But that's... Just wait till we get some training.
[07:48.13]Once there's training, then we can go from there.
[07:55.43]I know this is a very polarizing game.
[07:58.55]But you got... Look.
[08:01.09]I want... This was just a chill stream...
[08:04.47]I'm just hanging out, playing Kenshi.
[08:15.63]As long as you play GeoGuessr next, I'm good.
[08:21.00]What do you do in this game?
[08:21.80]I'll show you real quick.
[08:25.12]Oh, by the way, 700,000 games part 2 is actually ordered now.
[08:35.40]So, it'll be here.
[08:36.91]That'll be what we stream on either Thursday or Friday.
[08:38.67]In case you were curious.
[08:47.27]Oh my.
[08:48.13]Is this bar even going up?
[08:53.19]I'm on times three speed.
[08:54.87]Alright, this is not going to work.
[08:56.95]This is going to have to happen.
[08:57.97]Alright.
[08:59.32]So, you get off of that.
[09:01.70]Frog Musk is going to instead start training on that.
[09:08.11]Because that'll at least level you up once.
[09:09.98]So you are at... I gotta take the bag off of you.
[09:12.80]We need a storage unit.
[09:14.74]Oh, there's so much to do.
[09:15.68]Okay, hold on.
[09:19.12]Use.
[09:20.40]Uh, I need to... Where is it here?
[09:26.93]Is it in a build?
[09:27.67]Okay.
[09:28.79]Storage.
[09:29.41]Storage.
[09:36.19]Animal feeder.
[09:37.19]Armor storage box.
[09:41.35]Oh, God.
[09:42.47]Storage.
[09:43.09]Storage for copper.
[09:44.83]There's a different box for every single material?
[09:53.56]Shop counter.
[09:55.00]I just need a place to put my boxes.
[09:57.14]I'm just going to put them on the ground.
[10:01.12]Because I really... What am I supposed to do?
[10:03.54]I can't... I need to get materials.
[10:04.67]Materials.
[10:07.63]So, just put this shit on the ground for now.
[10:10.77]I'm gonna put this on.
[10:11.55]Oh my god, that's minus 11.
[10:14.65]The defense is so bad.
[10:16.45]I can't even... I can't justify wearing this.
[10:18.13]I need to just sell it.
[10:22.15]Alright, so... Put this down.
[10:25.26]That puts me at minus 2.
[10:29.98]What happens if I give this to Frogmusk?
[10:41.78]No, he's still at minus 2.
[10:45.80]Damn it!
[10:49.82]What if I put... Does anybody in here even... Can anybody even... Okay.
[10:54.38]With that bag off, 9 plus 4.
[10:59.20]She's the only one with any training.
[11:02.16]He has to sit here for... Everyone has to sit here all day and do this.
[11:05.90]So...
[11:11.66]Katana's one.
[11:12.58]It's a katana.
[11:18.99]Who has the good weapon?
[11:19.93]I know one of you does.
[11:22.43]What happens if I do this?
[11:24.01]No.
[11:28.31]I think... I don't know what to think, actually.
[11:31.83]This is going to take a long time.
[11:38.61]Because it's very, very clear that if I go out in the wilderness, I'm just dead.
[11:48.51]I'm trying to think of the correct solution here as to what I should do.
[11:52.47]Because everyone's worthless except for her.
[11:59.82]How much money do I have?
[12:02.78]I need, like, another mercenary.
[12:04.02]That's not useless.
[12:08.43]Maybe I should just take her out and just fight and just get beat up.
[12:12.19]I don't know.
[12:22.63]Because every time I take everybody out, they get their asses kicked.
[12:26.17]And then... What's toughness?
[12:29.03]Everybody at three... Ten toughness for the dog.
[12:33.28]Four, one.
[12:34.24]She has to go get beat up and fight.
[12:41.48]Alright.
[12:43.48]Let me, uh... What are the backpacks that I just threw on the ground?
[12:45.67]Let's just open it up.
[12:53.05]No, take them all.
[12:55.79]Somebody has to be the food carrier, because it really... This is just so bad.
[12:59.56]But, I mean, it doesn't matter anyways.
[13:04.14]This person's gonna be the food carrier, because this is just a 100% useless character.
[13:09.02]Even with the bag off.
[13:13.59]Even with the bag off, this character is totally useless.
[13:16.09]So you might as well just carry the fucking food.
[13:18.97]You need the best armor I can find.
[13:21.80]I need medkits too.
[13:30.12]Well, at least you're at almost level fucking 1.
[13:31.95]Minus 5.
[13:33.15]God damn it.
[13:43.05]You know, 20-20 hindsight, I should have off stream just sat here for like two hours and just had everybody just get to level five.
[13:47.96]Because we kind of, we kind of, we have to do this.
[13:55.90]There, there really is no other scenario.
[14:05.39]So how's everybody day today?
[14:06.47]You having a good day?
[14:13.08]The other scenario is to just have her get beat up outside.
[14:15.94]Alright, take the dog.
[14:24.39]Nobody has a job, right?
[14:25.33]Get rid of the jobs.
[14:28.20]What do you have for a weapon?
[14:29.12]You've got... This armor is not that great, but you can at least hurt things.
[14:34.30]Level 5 is still, like, nothing.
[14:36.04]Yeah.
[14:36.76]You can dump, like, 500 hours in this game and still barely have a character.
[14:41.89]So.
[14:42.79]There's a lot.
[14:46.49]I need to find a shitty bandit.
[14:49.15]That the dog and I can go fight together.
[14:51.75]So, let's take some food.
[14:53.73]You just train your fucking lockpicking or something.
[14:57.79]Because you two guys, the two frogs suck.
[15:02.20]I got money.
[15:02.72]I need some food.
[15:04.02]We'll just take it from you.
[15:05.09]No, you already ate it.
[15:16.24]And go on an expedition.
[15:17.24]I need some first aid kits too.
[15:18.36]Do you have any?
[15:21.10]You do.
[15:21.36]I got one.
[15:23.24]I'll take a few of them.
[15:25.42]I need to heal because I'm not at full health.
[15:36.38]Okay.
[15:37.82]Do I have enough of... I got bandage, I got a standard first aid kit, I got a splint.
[15:43.95]I might need another couple of first aid kits.
[15:53.01]Alright.
[15:53.59]Let's go buy a couple first aid kits, and then I'm gonna go and get my ass kicked.
[16:00.19]I need a store.
[16:04.07]Oh, that's alt, right?
[16:04.91]Yeah.
[16:10.33]Some of the weapons have minus attack?
[16:11.87]Yeah.
[16:12.11]Let's save it.
[16:16.97]What's quicksave?
[16:17.99]F9?
[16:18.03]F5, okay.
[16:37.57]Let's trade.
[16:38.17]Ah, I got food.
[16:39.99]You don't have any first aid kits, do you?
[16:43.81]Never mind.
[16:47.25]I want blood.
[16:49.12]Well, that's not how Kenshi works.
[16:52.72]Kenshi's one of those games where you can't go get blood.
[16:58.06]Actually, you can.
[16:58.72]It's yours.
[16:59.56]It falls on the fucking ground.
[17:01.50]You just die.
[17:04.58]Um...
[17:08.97]We want blood.
[17:09.77]You're gonna see my blood.
[17:11.01]Do I- who- where can I- Oh, it's been like too long since I played this, to be completely honest with you guys.
[17:18.46]Because I just forget where everything is.
[17:21.10]I know there's like a medical tent or something, right?
[17:29.75]Fuck.
[17:30.61]This might not have been a great idea.
[17:41.60]He doesn't want to play.
[17:42.68]No, I just forgot that I'm at a point with an extreme amount of downtime.
[17:48.31]So, mmm.
[17:52.87]No, we don't sell anything.
[17:59.68]I remember hitting this point and being like, alright!
[18:01.74]And then now it's like, I have, everyone has to train and shit.
[18:04.10]I can't, there is no like, run out there and fucking attack!
[18:08.36]We gotta like, actually play it.
[18:10.06]You know?
[18:10.84]So.
[18:12.94]That's what I'm gonna do.
[18:15.87]I wanted just today to be a relaxing day anyway, so... I'm okay with it.
[18:20.59]I just need to remember where everything is.
[18:21.87]Because there's a lot of information in this game that's really easy to have it just kind of slip away when you do other shit.
[18:31.34]So where can I buy first aid kits?
[18:34.18]The bar?
[18:39.66]I've been into, like, almost every one of these places.
[18:41.26]There's gotta be, like, the Adventurer's Tent or something.
[18:44.46]I'm trying to remember.
[18:56.55]Steal them.
[19:00.93]Ugh, I just wish I fucking remembered where anything was.
[19:04.13]The Adventurer's Tent?
[19:05.31]Wasn't I just in here?
[19:11.61]He had six kits?
[19:12.59]The scale avatar?
[19:14.77]61.
[19:21.32]Alright.
[19:30.16]Well, I gotta go look.
[19:31.34]Because I can't just sit here.
[19:33.14]My brain right now is just turned off for some reason.
[19:36.69]Because I... Just bear with me here.
[19:44.79]We need sustenance.
[19:48.87]Alright.
[19:51.37]Where the fuck am I going?
[19:54.36]The bars usually have kits, don't they?
[19:56.40]At least some of them do.
[20:10.99]Ugh!
[20:11.07]Ugh!
[20:17.43]I know there's like a medical tent.
[20:20.35]Am I just not seeing it?
[20:25.31]Shop across from the bed store.
[20:33.79]Like this place?
[20:35.73]Here's the bed store, right?
[20:45.77]Okay, good.
[20:46.31]There they are.
[20:47.87]How did I miss those the first time?
[20:48.93]Because they're tiny.
[20:49.55]Alright, that's good.
[20:51.01]I don't want to spend that much money.
[20:53.43]Alright, let's go.
[20:56.60]You two just train.
[20:58.26]Good luck.
[21:00.30]I'm going to take you guys.
[21:04.68]Let's go.
[21:05.50]I was already down here.
[21:11.33]Let's go this way.
[21:16.29]Because that's where, like, the weird bug people are.
[21:17.85]I'd rather just go... Let's try to get, like, out here.
[21:20.59]So, down this way.
[21:25.10]We have not seen over here.
[21:27.12]Let's go!
[21:32.02]The reason why I'm taking these two... Oh my god!
[21:35.10]Sorry.
[21:36.52]Is because they're the only ones that really can do anything.
[21:40.07]And if anyone wants to get in a fight, it probably should be these two.
[21:43.66]Because the other two are kind of useless right now.
[21:46.16]So they train.
[21:47.78]We go.
[21:57.87]Come on.
[21:58.73]What's this?
[22:01.39]Can I interact with that?
[22:02.51]No.
[22:04.14]Speaking of need to have things done.
[22:07.38]You need to bodyguard.
[22:09.98]And follow.
[22:11.34]And then we turn it on there.
[22:12.20]Alright, let's go.
[22:14.44]Match each other's speed.
[22:17.46]Pick up the cigarette butts.
[22:24.45]I only just noticed the webcam.
[22:31.71]Border zone.
[22:32.57]Discovered Lone Shack.
[22:37.73]Can you just give me like some shitty dog or some shitty guy walking around?
[22:41.29]Remember that wicked shitty guy?
[22:47.26]That guy was just walking around town and I kicked the shit out of him like four times.
[22:51.49]I need just like a one guy standing around.
[22:58.13]What's down here?
[23:00.77]Not much right now.
[23:06.77]I can see them training over there.
[23:09.17]Go on, keep going.
[23:24.37]I gotta save this game.
[23:25.45]I'm gonna get fucking collapsed on.
[23:27.47]Someone's gonna come from stage left and rip my fucking teeth out.
[23:34.83]Alright, looking good so far.
[23:35.79]Any resources?
[23:39.04]That's not a resource, is it?
[23:40.38]No.
[23:51.22]Don't mind?
[23:51.87]No, I don't need to.
[23:52.73]I have plenty of money right now.
[23:54.75]I have, like, $8,000.
[23:58.03]I'm good for mining.
[23:58.75]I need to discover a new place.
[24:01.69]Well, just did.
[24:08.57]Alright, here we go.
[24:17.92]Even if they're friendly, I think I'm gonna throw a sword in somebody's head.
[24:20.36]I mean, that sounds terrible, but, you know, I gotta work in reality here, you know?
[24:26.02]I have to fight somebody that sucks.
[24:30.75]I have to get into a conflict with somebody that sucks.
[24:34.81]Anybody in here suck?
[24:37.67]Anybody in here suck?
[24:44.29]59 plus 2.
[24:46.59]Oh my god, we are such shitties.
[24:50.57]Welcome, take a look around.
[24:51.63]Okay, well what do you got?
[24:54.29]Let's talk.
[24:57.12]Show me what you got.
[25:00.66]A crossbow?
[25:05.38]What does this do?
[25:07.86]Katana.
[25:08.12]120, 47 armor penetration, defense attack bonus.
[25:12.27]Damage versus robots.
[25:15.93]12 to 24 damage.
[25:16.89]Should I get a crossbow?
[25:22.48]Oh, I forgot.
[25:23.00]Don't idle.
[25:23.66]I forgot about that.
[25:28.07]How much is a crossbow?
[25:28.93]1500?
[25:30.93]Should we make this character ranged?
[25:37.45]I feel like that would be helpful.
[25:43.02]High.
[25:44.22]This is a good 1628.
[25:48.94]Chatham, Madam Sarelin might have to be ranged.
[25:52.04]And then what?
[25:52.42]Build up dexterity, right?
[25:59.12]Sell value is what you buy it for.
[26:02.78]Yeah, so I got, I got, that's 1,500.
[26:04.20]I think it's worth it.
[26:08.60]You have no ammo.
[26:10.57]What can I, can I make?
[26:11.49]I got ammo right here.
[26:13.11]Bolts, right?
[26:17.21]So that's 11 bolts.
[26:20.58]And I could probably make them.
[26:24.16]It's 6,000.
[26:26.51]Well, didn't somebody say it's the sell value?
[26:29.23]Value, 6,000.
[26:30.09]Oh, that's how much I sell it to them for.
[26:32.37]This is six grand.
[26:35.50]Oh, so that's how much I can sell it for.
[26:38.90]One person was trying to fuck with me.
[26:41.30]It's alright.
[26:46.86]So, steal it is what the correct answer here is.
[26:54.41]Time machine.
[26:58.35]Raw meat.
[27:00.38]Do you have any to sit around?
[27:04.28]I wonder... Okay, you got a chest back here.
[27:09.44]But... There's probably nothing... It would be in here.
[27:13.41]Weapon cabinet.
[27:14.85]Condition 2.
[27:16.99]Should I wait till night?
[27:21.76]Maybe let's just wait till it's dark out.
[27:31.91]Alright, a couple people up here.
[27:33.21]This is some bodyguard.
[27:35.86]These people are all... will kill me instantly, so... No, I can't do anything here.
[27:41.30]I gotta either buy it or... steal food from them.
[27:48.08]Mm-mm.
[27:50.12]Well, I know there's a crossbow here, so... Some guards may fall asleep, that's true.
[27:59.91]I don't think I can do anything there.
[28:01.11]Just gonna have to keep going.
[28:04.71]Where's the rest of the party?
[28:05.45]The rest of the party is back here, uh, training.
[28:10.23]Because... They're just, they're just truly awful.
[28:14.98]And you can get up to five points on a training dummy.
[28:19.86]I'm gonna switch off between them.
[28:21.06]Lockpicking is training here.
[28:23.10]So they're back home.
[28:25.72]Your characters should get jobs.
[28:30.55]Not yet.
[28:32.48]I need to be... I have to be able to withstand one punch before I go get like a job.
[28:40.28]So let's take you guys down here.
[28:42.64]Let's keep going.
[28:45.40]I got plenty of food.
[28:46.48]I got plenty of first aid.
[28:48.84]And Madam Sandler has nine plus four.
[28:53.20]So not totally useless.
[28:58.01]Why are you going up the mountain?
[29:01.08]We want Dr. Phil.
[29:03.12]No, no Dr. Phil.
[29:08.79]Not today.
[29:09.15]What is this?
[29:15.25]It's an iron.
[29:15.94]No, I don't need a mine right now.
[29:18.08]I'm looking for new places and new people.
[29:24.46]Because there's like a bunch of shit down here.
[29:27.63]I was told last time that down there is worth looking at.
[29:29.85]So we're going to do it.
[29:30.89]Why are you turning around?
[29:40.60]What's the frog gang goal?
[29:45.86]To just live.
[29:49.22]Just survive.
[29:50.84]That's all I can do.
[29:52.54]Look behind you.
[29:56.00]Oh, are you talking... Yeah.
[30:02.35]Just live.
[30:05.65]I walked past a town?
[30:06.73]Well, there's... I got the town right next to me.
[30:08.11]I want to get down into, like, the swamp area down here.
[30:13.53]Zoom out and go back.
[30:17.76]Well, even if there is, like, a little town.
[30:20.30]Yeah, but... No, it's... Hmm...
[30:28.06]We'll take a look.
[30:32.67]Can you guys hear, like, the children?
[30:36.15]I don't know what's going on with, like, the children I can hear.
[30:39.09]Alright.
[30:45.58]This is... What's this town called?
[30:47.60]The Hub.
[30:54.05]Just hearing things.
[30:56.87]I'm telling you, I can hear them.
[30:57.99]I can hear them.
[30:59.81]Let's go inside here.
[31:03.85]And... I wonder what we can find.
[31:05.87]That's a Fallout reference?
[31:16.82]This game reminds me of Fallout.
[31:18.41]Fallout 2.
[31:20.97]Take away a lot of the dialogue options.
[31:23.09]And... I guess, like, the guns.
[31:25.03]This, like, feels very Fallout.
[31:27.17]Top-down-ish.
[31:29.51]Alright.
[31:30.59]This is a new town.
[31:32.71]Is there anybody in here?
[31:34.95]This is still, uh... Holy Nation Outlaws.
[31:37.15]That person's by the name... That person's name is Sans.
[31:39.81]In case anybody was curious.
[31:42.31]Bunch of run-down, shitty buildings.
[31:43.95]I can buy this one.
[31:47.08]Mmm.
[31:47.98]Do I buy this shack here?
[31:53.62]This town kinda sucks.
[31:58.50]What's even in this town that's worth doing?
[32:02.62]Holy shit, look at this place!
[32:03.86]4800?
[32:09.89]This is a big house, but I'm in- the- the- the real estate is...
[32:20.20]I don't think it's worth it.
[32:20.94]There's nothing here to... I'm going to have to rebuild the whole town.
[32:25.40]You could make it your own town.
[32:28.73]I guess.
[32:29.21]Yeah, that's true.
[32:30.03]I don't have the money to rebuild the whole town.
[32:37.45]Welcome, friend.
[32:42.81]Let's do business.
[32:43.33]What do you got?
[32:45.29]More crossbows.
[32:47.97]Bolts.
[32:49.19]Polearm.
[32:51.96]What's this one?
[32:53.60]Cutting damage 47.
[32:55.90]Cutting damage 29.
[32:56.48]No.
[32:56.82]I mean, that's plus 6 attack bonus.
[33:02.13]This was plus 4.
[33:03.53]Minus 30% armor penetration.
[33:06.49]Damage versus animals.
[33:07.33]That's not bad.
[33:10.55]Crossbow would be good.
[33:11.68]I just... I can't reliably have bolts, though.
[33:19.32]Anybody upstairs?
[33:21.36]Who are you?
[33:23.10]Talk to stone.
[33:25.86]Need yourself a gunner?
[33:26.88]I promise you I've got good eyes, eyes of a hawk, been manning turrets since before I sprouted a beard on my face.
[33:34.79]The guy doesn't have a beard.
[33:37.45]Maybe, how much?
[33:40.45]6,000 cats is all I ask, that and a clan to watch my back.
[33:47.33]I don't have 6,000.
[33:52.88]Why's my dog grow- What the fuck is going on?
[33:57.68]Who are these?
[34:00.37]Oh, I- I just thought the ton was being raided by, like, Mutant Taffy.
[34:05.33]God, alright.
[34:06.25]I don't even have turrets, yeah.
[34:10.81]Forget about that guy.
[34:14.90]Anybody else?
[34:21.65]Maybe I should just buy that guy.
[34:24.23]Does that mean he comes prepackaged with good attack?
[34:27.29]At least good enough?
[34:31.36]You know what I mean?
[34:31.78]Does this guy come with, like, all the assembly?
[34:34.04]I just have to build it?
[34:44.18]That's a lot of money, but still.
[34:48.08]Pacifier.
[34:49.78]Bar Thug Drunk.
[34:52.19]Need some organs.
[34:54.69]I can get kidneys, spleens, limbs, whatever you want, all working and tested, best quality.
[35:00.39]You're creepy.
[35:01.73]How do you test organs?
[35:02.97]I need to talk to someone over here for a sec.
[35:07.79]Uh, how do you test organs?
[35:12.26]Only with the best scientifical equipments, that's how.
[35:14.96]I'd give these kidneys to my own mother if she was still alive.
[35:17.34]Valkryn, bless her bones.
[35:23.21]Uh.
[35:25.15]That sounds like bullshit.
[35:27.01]Then I get out of my face, stop asking questions, no one's forcing you to buy them.
[35:33.48]The fuck is that?
[35:38.74]Alright, well.
[35:41.40]I'm gonna do something here.
[35:42.16]I'm gonna save.
[35:43.52]I wanna see what this guy's worth.
[35:46.17]6,000 cats.
[35:46.79]Everyone else was 3.
[35:48.33]That means he's worth it.
[35:54.61]I want to try.
[35:55.59]I just want to see what his attack points are.
[36:00.43]He's a scammer.
[36:01.13]I mean, he's got 11 plus 12.
[36:09.15]That's not bad to start.
[36:10.39]11 plus 12?
[36:20.51]Everybody that's been free has been shitty.
[36:27.19]Well, I guess not.
[36:30.45]He claimed he was a gunman.
[36:31.89]Yeah, but maybe I need that.
[36:33.85]I might need a gunner.
[36:36.21]Any way to expand my crew, guys?
[36:37.59]Alright, well, this town is... There's nobody here.
[36:43.29]Alright, well, hold on a minute.
[36:44.15]Who are you?
[36:45.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:45.77]We got some interactions here.
[36:48.55]Heft.
[36:54.23]Hadn't had a city.
[36:54.87]Need any recruits?
[36:57.57]Yeah.
[37:00.08]Sure, but I'll need 3,000 cats first.
[37:03.04]Help me out and I'll work off my debt for you.
[37:06.70]You're trying to rip me off.
[37:07.78]I ain't trying to rip you off.
[37:13.30]4 plus 3 minus 4 minus 5.
[37:14.46]You want $3,000?
[37:14.76]What's up with that?
[37:15.58]Anybody else in here?
[37:30.42]You gotta give me something to work with if you want that kind of money.
[37:38.06]Any other spot to go?
[37:42.69]It's like rum in here.
[37:43.81]Or empty rum.
[37:47.45]Is there any other spot?
[37:49.93]Because there's one bar.
[37:52.81]And then... There ain't shit over here.
[37:56.58]This place is just destroyed.
[38:08.10]There's nowhere else I can go.
[38:09.73]It's just this place right here.
[38:12.17]Go into the tower.
[38:16.33]I guess I'll go in the tower.
[38:17.33]Alright, somebody's standing out here.
[38:23.02]Thief boss.
[38:27.34]Thief boss.
[38:28.02]Is this a fence?
[38:30.91]So you want in on the Shinobi.
[38:32.73]The guards try to lay the crackdown, but they ain't fooling nobody.
[38:35.51]They're nothing.
[38:36.53]Nothing a few catskin.
[38:37.67]I want to join the Shinobi thieves.
[38:41.83]Should I be a thief?
[38:48.63]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[38:52.21]You can join for a fee.
[38:54.50]That's it?
[38:54.92]I don't have to complete a test to prove myself or anything.
[38:57.82]Do I look like I've got time for handing out busy work?
[39:00.28]No, this is a business we're running.
[39:01.95]Not a social club.
[39:02.89]Just one-time membership fee of 10,000 cats.
[39:08.99]I'm- I- I could... Yeah, it's the Thieves Guild.
[39:14.21]What do you think they're doing to me?
[39:16.81]They're robbing me right now.
[39:19.89]What do I get in return?
[39:21.43]You get yourself allies.
[39:22.75]We have hideouts like this one in lots of major towns.
[39:24.79]We watch each other's backs.
[39:25.73]Shinobi thieves stick together.
[39:26.95]Okay, worth it.
[39:28.17]It's a safe haven for you to rest and recover.
[39:30.01]We have specialist training equipment to use.
[39:31.89]You can sell your stolen items to our fence.
[39:33.88]And they also sell some hard to find specialist equipment at a huge discount.
[39:41.50]Okay.
[39:44.88]How you guys doing over here?
[39:46.26]You ready to go like sell everything you own?
[39:50.61]We gotta get money, because that's very... I... Allies.
[39:53.37]I heard the word allies.
[39:57.62]This boomer is about to get scammed.
[40:01.72]I'm not gonna get scammed.
[40:07.64]Yeah, you gotta... Like, I gotta go in, like, a better spot.
[40:11.54]Is there even... There is no good spot for a webcam.
[40:13.58]Because I feel like this is distracting down here.
[40:19.86]This is distracting down here.
[40:24.88]Top left, but then I'm looking the wrong way.
[40:29.41]I'm going to have to spin this around.
[40:34.41]See?
[40:34.75]That's kind of better, isn't it?
[40:40.28]Yeah, that's too distracting down there.
[40:46.68]Alright.
[40:47.58]Alright, now, this is what we, this is what we started.
[40:49.62]This is what we, I know, I know a lot of people, you know, maybe, maybe it's about a bunch of people left, people didn't want to watch this, you know what I mean?
[40:57.63]It's boring, but, I mean, this is fun, you know?
[41:02.49]I just, we're just having fun, we're just chilling out.
[41:04.85]I know it might not be the most interesting stream we've ever been to, but, it's all good.
[41:10.95]Sometimes you gotta do one of these.
[41:11.95]I need to just chill sometimes, you know?
[41:17.03]Nah, like, fucking, let's go.
[41:18.27]I was a little, like, concerned at first because I thought I was going to be so lost, but now I'm, I am, I am found.
[41:23.62]I have been found.
[41:32.40]It just takes a minute to get back into it and get $10,000 to join the Thieves' Guild.
[41:35.83]See you in two hours.
[41:39.59]So, what are you at?
[41:41.69]What's your attack at right now?
[41:43.54]Attack is at 5.
[41:46.16]That's as much as I'm going to get.
[41:48.28]So you have to stop, Frogmusk.
[41:49.62]You're not going to get any more points from a basic training.
[41:53.68]We got the Thieves Guild.
[41:57.38]So you stop.
[41:58.40]Switch places.
[42:00.58]Let him train.
[42:02.82]Look at this.
[42:03.20]He's not going to go anywhere.
[42:04.30]He's hitting a rock right now.
[42:05.72]You're done.
[42:07.16]Switch.
[42:09.66]Because he is at...
[42:12.74]Attack 2.
[42:13.48]So you're gonna get a few more points while you do that.
[42:15.80]Work on your lockpicking.
[42:18.14]By the time they get back... Lockpicking 8.
[42:19.74]Yeah, your lockpicking is terrible.
[42:23.29]It's 22 lockpicking.
[42:24.31]Alright, they're good.
[42:25.01]They switched places.
[42:29.33]We are in pain.
[42:30.35]We need music.
[42:35.22]Not right now.
[42:37.20]Not right now.
[42:39.78]Is there... Actually, there is music in the game.
[42:42.40]But I turned off, didn't I?
[42:43.86]Yeah.
[42:45.40]We'll bring the music back from Kenshi.
[42:52.21]What an awful streamer.
[42:54.85]No, no, I just, hold on.
[42:58.27]Everybody just chill, you know?
[43:01.35]The title of the stream says, let's chill out.
[43:03.46]Alright, let's, speaking of chill...
[43:10.75]What are you guys up to here?
[43:12.85]Okay, I get 7,900.
[43:14.85]There was an iron vein out here.
[43:16.35]What's going on here?
[43:24.67]There was an iron... Wait, I actually have... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:28.15]Just wait one second here.
[43:29.75]Somebody... I have, like, a huge expensive piece of armor.
[43:35.79]Who has it?
[43:39.27]You do.
[43:43.49]$1,500 to sell this.
[43:44.53]But this might be worth keeping to put on.
[43:56.50]This is all so expensive.
[43:59.80]Sell value $2,000.
[44:01.48]Look at this shit.
[44:02.70]I could do it right now.
[44:03.48]It's too heavy though.
[44:13.74]Wait, 19.
[44:15.78]This one is only 3.
[44:18.26]I might hold on to this one.
[44:19.70]Or this one.
[44:27.34]Settle to a fence.
[44:28.36]Yeah, and I have access to a permanent fence later.
[44:31.52]So I guess... I'm just going to do it the old-fashioned way.
[44:36.44]Let's go get some... Hey, welcome to the mining stream.
[44:40.36]I need to mine.
[44:41.41]Maybe I should take everybody to mine.
[44:44.93]Let's see what we got here.
[44:49.17]Can you make the face cam smaller?
[44:51.31]Is it too big?
[44:55.87]Anything, any veins or anything out here?
[45:01.44]Who's that?
[45:02.00]Where are they?
[45:04.50]Hungry bandit.
[45:07.08]Chase this motherfucker down.
[45:23.09]Oh, you're like a little ant.
[45:30.91]Don't let him get away.
[45:39.74]How can you sprint that fast?
[45:50.49]You're so hungry, yet you're running this ridiculous marathon right now.
[45:58.26]Are we ever going to catch this guy?
[46:01.88]He's like Sonic the fucking Hedgehog.
[46:09.96]Look at how far away we are.
[46:16.50]He eventually has to stop and start walking, right?
[46:19.04]Nobody can run forever.
[46:31.13]Am I, like, in a full sprint?
[46:34.29]Whoa, he's turning the... He just ripped around the other direction.
[46:36.85]Okay, here we go.
[46:37.47]Speaking of training, it's time to kick somebody's ass.
[46:40.58]Let's go.
[46:43.44]He's running right back into us.
[46:46.98]Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go, go, go, go.
[46:50.40]Alright.
[46:51.12]This is what we trained for.
[46:53.20]To beat up feeble, hungry bandits.
[47:00.01]Get back here.
[47:10.72]No!
[47:11.96]Let's go!
[47:12.70]Get over here!
[47:19.02]First of all.
[47:27.16]Attack.
[47:29.32]Dog is set to bodyguard.
[47:31.48]Dog is set to run.
[47:35.18]Attack.
[47:36.30]They're both attacking.
[47:42.09]Are they gonna even make it there?
[47:53.88]Oh my god, why?
[47:54.94]Why is this guy so fast?
[48:05.08]And what is this?
[48:05.80]There's a copper vein right here.
[48:13.91]It's not worth it at this point.
[48:15.91]This dude has 500 trillion stamina.
[48:28.44]Fuck it.
[48:30.62]Sorry.
[48:30.96]I mean, I'm not going to chase this guy across the whole world.
[48:36.41]This copper right here.
[48:37.69]Forget it.
[48:47.41]Recruit him?
[48:48.43]I can't even track him down to have a conversation.
[48:54.01]Unless he's not... Is he like running back?
[48:57.01]No.
[48:57.39]That dude... He's just gone.
[49:14.84]See you later.
[49:16.16]Thanks for playing.
[49:22.93]This is the closest we're ever gonna get to Jerma playing RuneScape.
[49:28.24]I'm not gonna play RuneScape.
[49:30.18]Uh-oh.
[49:31.14]How much are these worth?
[49:31.82]167.
[49:33.24]I'm not gonna have enough space.
[49:34.92]Because I didn't bring a backpack because I was trying to get out there and swing at people.
[49:45.69]Shit.
[49:47.61]Why are you hungry?
[49:54.29]I did say I wasn't going to play Minecraft, but then I got shit-faced.
[49:57.37]And I played it.
[50:02.15]Don't waste time mining without a backpack.
[50:05.03]Yeah, I know.
[50:05.95]That's probably a bad idea.
[50:07.77]And I can't even carry anymore.
[50:08.77]I have two.
[50:13.81]I want to fight somebody.
[50:18.77]Where the hell even am I?
[50:19.77]I spent... I chased that guy around.
[50:21.41]Alright, here's the plan.
[50:23.42]You go back to the hub.
[50:25.28]Maybe I'll run into something on the way there.
[50:28.65]These two, now that they're trained up, and now I'm gonna take them to go mine while we head back.
[50:35.49]Sell a piece of armor, I need a fence, so I gotta take... Dead.
[50:40.25]You're dead.
[50:42.05]You're dead.
[50:44.99]Hungry bandit.
[50:46.41]Oh, you're dead.
[51:02.06]Let's go.
[51:05.57]Get him.
[51:08.57]Nice bite.
[51:10.87]Beautiful.
[51:14.37]I mean, you missed, but it's okay.
[51:16.01]Good.
[51:16.19]Okay, got him.
[51:16.77]What do you have on you?
[51:19.22]Nothing.
[51:22.72]Martial arts.
[51:24.68]I forgot how fucked up this person was.
[51:30.41]It's like they're just running into me.
[51:32.37]It's like they're just trying to let me.
[51:34.11]They heard me.
[51:45.28]Don't let them get away.
[51:46.96]Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[51:54.15]No, they're too fast!
[51:56.11]There's just a line of them!
[51:58.17]Just... Oh my god, hold on, this is too overwhelming!
[52:02.53]Kill!
[52:07.92]Just stay here, and just farm them.
[52:22.52]There's another.
[52:23.36]There's another one.
[52:24.78]Oh, he figured it out.
[52:26.14]You deserve to live.
[52:26.82]You're a smart one.
[52:31.14]What am I biting?
[52:32.78]Just nice.
[52:36.95]Destroyed.
[52:38.01]Excellent work.
[52:41.53]Pretty good practice I'm getting here.
[52:43.95]Did I level up anything at all?
[52:45.33]Combat.
[52:45.73]Melee attack.
[52:46.41]Ooh, almost.
[52:47.93]What about the dog?
[52:49.49]Eleven.
[52:50.79]Dog is fucking strong now.
[52:55.23]Anybody have anything?
[52:57.31]Why would they?
[52:57.77]They're hungry bandits.
[53:03.18]That was pretty cool.
[53:05.12]That was for free.
[53:07.34]The dog is finally useful.
[53:08.94]Feed dog.
[53:15.60]Dog fed.
[53:19.52]To all... everybody that said...
[53:22.65]Why don't you just kill the dog?
[53:24.79]Throw the dog down a cliff.
[53:26.79]Why are you carrying the dog around?
[53:29.47]It's just, look at that, 11 melee attack now.
[53:33.03]Strongest person in the party.
[53:37.97]Just is.
[53:38.89]The dog is the strongest member of our party.
[53:43.23]Something's already wrong with you.
[53:45.48]Alright, here we go.
[53:48.06]Just drip feed us enemies.
[53:51.64]Okay.
[53:53.02]Both of you.
[53:56.66]Hold on.
[54:03.26]Can I... Can I heal?
[54:09.12]Enslave, enslave, enslave.
[54:10.65]How do I do that?
[54:20.21]Heal the... I don't have... I don't have anything.
[54:24.60]Start... Why would I... No.
[54:29.26]You can't.
[54:29.86]Yeah, I can't.
[54:37.72]So we're just gonna continue our free... Our free attack.
[54:46.05]Bring it on.
[54:47.15]Level up.
[54:48.85]It's almost like the game was listening to me.
[54:51.68]Because now these two are the fighters.
[54:56.42]No, don't... Dog, don't let him get away.
[55:08.27]He doesn't... He's hurt and you can't even catch up to him?
[55:14.27]This guy has like a broken leg and I can't even catch him with the dog.
[55:35.45]He's gonna fight me for a second.
[55:42.76]Get over here.
[55:49.70]I'm closing it.
[55:50.32]I'm clo- Ooh, I cut him off around the corner.
[55:57.01]Get it!
[55:57.31]Ah!
[56:07.69]Got it!
[56:18.96]Nice.
[56:19.38]Okay, good work, dog.
[56:23.79]Come back here.
[56:25.29]This is just the bandit pass.
[56:31.21]I'm a monster.
[56:32.63]But am I, though?
[56:33.31]I need to level up.
[56:37.75]Melee attack 6.
[56:38.81]Leveled up.
[56:39.41]Good.
[56:39.65]That's good, good, good, good, good.
[56:40.91]10 plus 4.
[56:41.93]Excellent!
[56:42.27]They're not going to have anything.
[56:46.51]But, okay, it's time to sell.
[56:49.80]Where's the dog?
[56:53.04]Get over here.
[56:59.58]Match each other's speed, if you will.
[57:05.35]Alright, I was in the process of moving somewhere.
[57:07.47]Where the hell was I going?
[57:08.54]Back to the hub.
[57:12.56]Bandits and dog food.
[57:17.58]Pretty slow, though.
[57:19.08]The dog.
[57:21.28]Alright, I don't want to run into anything.
[57:24.56]So, let's check on.
[57:27.63]Nothing over here, right?
[57:28.75]I'm not going to get jumped.
[57:30.53]Alright, let's go take a look at the other two.
[57:34.75]See how they're doing.
[57:39.60]Still training.
[57:47.73]What are you at?
[57:50.39]Melee attack 5.
[57:51.73]Melee attack 5.
[57:52.91]So, not going to get any more use out of this.
[57:55.94]They're both at 5.
[58:00.14]Why do you suck so much?
[58:01.52]Minus 5.
[58:02.28]Is it because he has too much weight on him?
[58:10.09]26 out of 43.
[58:15.87]Is that why you just suck such ass right now?
[58:19.98]45 out of 43.
[58:20.46]This is too heavy.
[58:24.12]Let me see if that... Is it the weapon?
[58:31.81]Why do I have this thing on?
[58:34.17]What's the point of this?
[58:38.30]If this thing's made of- it may as well be made of rubber.
[58:45.84]I'd like whip it around a fucking socket, people.
[58:53.44]Uh, so this is going away.
[58:54.85]Because what the hell- I need a different weapon.
[58:56.83]That's not a minus five attack.
[58:58.29]Just sell this thing.
[59:00.07]What a piece of shit.
[59:02.79]What about you?
[59:04.07]-2 attack.
[59:09.84]Why do I have these even on?
[59:16.43]I need to sell... This is going to get put on.
[59:20.53]So I'm going to give this to... Sandler.
[59:24.13]Because this thing is actually good.
[59:27.00]Blunt resistance, cut resistance.
[59:28.28]It's a standard grade.
[59:33.02]What's the weight on this one?
[59:37.14]Three.
[59:37.52]This is also blunt.
[59:38.42]These two...
[59:40.89]Look at this resistance on this, though.
[59:43.25]I almost want to put this all on... I'm at a loss.
[59:50.38]I'm not sure if I should just put this on everybody.
[59:53.12]Just have them build up their strength.
[60:11.38]So this minus 5 is coming from... It's coming from the equipment penalty.
[60:18.51]So this should be 5.
[60:22.01]And then this minus 7 is coming from equipment penalty as well.
[60:26.73]Equipment penalty.
[60:28.93]God damn, how bad is the stuff I'm wearing?
[60:31.00]Have I just been wearing awful stuff the whole time?
[60:38.05]Why does my character suck so much?
[60:39.79]Combat skill bump.
[60:40.67]Minus five from the backpack.
[60:47.11]Somebody just has to be a mule.
[60:51.68]Somebody has to be a mule.
[60:52.84]That's the only way it's possible.
[60:55.02]And it's going to have to be Canroth.
[60:57.88]Canroth is the item mule.
[60:59.80]That's just what's going to happen.
[61:07.97]So, get everything over here.
[61:09.47]You just put all the items over in your backpack, your body.
[61:15.54]You're going to be worthless anyways having a huge backpack on.
[61:20.88]So let's see how that changes things.
[61:23.39]So you are now still at minus seven from all that shit.
[61:28.55]You just have a terrible weapon on.
[61:30.23]So I just need to replace your weapon.
[61:32.09]Or just take it off.
[61:34.37]Right?
[61:34.69]Why even have it on?
[61:40.02]Oh my goodness.
[61:41.59]9 plus 8.
[61:43.21]This is just weighing his arms down.
[61:46.03]This dude's arms are just spaghetti.
[61:48.31]But they made, there's like razors on them.
[61:55.88]Okay.
[61:57.12]I'm getting an indoor bonus.
[62:06.06]So, you, you're the item mule.
[62:09.28]Speaking of item mules, I need to find a fence, because I'm going to sell this armor.
[62:16.11]So let's have a fun job of finding a fence.
[62:20.39]Put on, hold on, let me save it.
[62:21.56]Just in case it crashes or something.
[62:25.68]Alright, oh, we got, let's put on, let's put on something relaxing.
[62:41.94]This is Fallout 2.
[62:43.98]Okay.
[62:44.54]Made sure it was on the right volume.
[62:55.13]I don't want it to be loud, I just want it to be in the background.
[63:00.47]Okay, let's go.
[63:03.62]I put Avril Lavigne on loop or riot.
[63:09.16]I think you might be the only person that's gonna riot.
[63:12.67]If I were to guess.
[63:14.39]It's gonna be a one-man riot.
[63:17.31]Alright, let's go find a fence.
[63:22.33]What's that?
[63:25.27]Why is that here?
[63:39.30]Go get that.
[63:40.54]No, no, no, forget it.
[63:41.80]Go find a fence.
[63:44.52]I got all this shit to sell.
[63:51.25]Fine, let's look at a bar.
[63:56.11]Oh, a forced one-guy riot.
[64:00.89]What is the percentage to sell this stuff?
[64:04.60]27, 27.
[64:08.22]Fuck this sword, this thing sucks.
[64:16.05]Uh, 27%.
[64:16.41]27%.
[64:20.67]Avril Lavigne deserves it.
[64:24.17]And Avril Lavigne... No.
[64:29.41]That's fine, I can buy one of my anti-riot shields.
[64:37.97]You want me to play the one song that Avril Lavigne does.
[64:40.65]You guys don't understand.
[64:42.71]When Avril Lavigne does a concert, she loops two songs.
[64:47.39]She gets on the stage and she does, Hey you, I want to be your boyfriend.
[64:51.29]And then she does, I hope you have the time of your life.
[65:01.79]And then she just repeats them both 17 times.
[65:09.65]Alright.
[65:11.29]Uh... No fence in here.
[65:16.65]Let's check upstairs.
[65:18.39]I know I get a fence when I join.
[65:20.09]I'm kind of at a weird spot right now because I need a fence to sell the stuff to be able to get enough money to get a permanent fence.
[65:27.27]But I need 10,000.
[65:28.05]I don't have 10,000 yet.
[65:30.96]Where are you guys?
[65:35.62]Oh, look.
[65:35.94]You made it.
[65:38.08]Alright, sell this couple of copper that I have.
[65:40.35]I need a fence.
[65:51.66]Grab your rocks, everybody.
[65:53.30]Don't you even think about it.
[65:57.88]Don't even think about picking up a rock right now.
[66:10.44]throwing rocks.
[66:12.64]Everybody wants to throw rocks at me.
[66:15.56]It's not fair.
[66:16.30]Alright, let's talk.
[66:21.79]So, I got some copper to sell you.
[66:23.89]8300.
[66:23.91]That's all I have.
[66:52.59]What's going on with you?
[66:58.37]Escaped servant?
[67:02.44]What do I do about this guy?
[67:04.54]Can I help this person?
[67:13.30]Who's this?
[67:15.86]Eat him?
[67:16.44]No, I'm not gonna eat this guy.
[67:17.92]If I first aid this guy, that's not gonna do anything for me.
[67:26.28]Join the thieves?
[67:26.98]Yeah, I need 10,000, so I'm trying to figure out the fastest way to make money.
[67:29.90]See what happens.
[67:46.19]Where's my first aid?
[67:52.14]Level up first aid, but that's spending money.
[67:59.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[67:59.94]Hold on.
[68:00.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[68:00.68]Why is it not leveling up first dead anymore?
[68:08.44]Should I leave him now?
[68:12.80]Oh, it is.
[68:13.20]Okay.
[68:21.64]Alright, so what's this guy... Is this guy gonna be thankful?
[68:26.06]Give me money?
[68:26.62]Help me?
[68:27.00]Join my team?
[68:35.62]splint his injuries.
[68:41.70]He... Uh... I don't... I don't know.
[68:52.38]His blood has to come back.
[68:53.77]Oh.
[68:55.29]How do I... Can I give him blood?
[68:57.03]Wait.
[68:57.29]Hold on.
[68:57.55]He's getting up.
[69:00.71]Stand up.
[69:10.84]I got 21st aid left.
[69:16.76]Dog, feed, dog, feed, dog, feed, dog.
[69:24.34]I guess he's just gonna be there for a little while.
[69:26.40]Whatever.
[69:29.18]If I hit him on the leg, it'll... I'm not gonna hit him.
[69:33.56]I don't wanna, like, kill the guy.
[69:36.97]Steal him.
[69:38.15]I can't.
[69:43.20]Alright.
[69:44.88]Fence.
[69:45.44]That's what I was doing before.
[69:46.42]8300.
[69:46.44]I need another... Get out there.
[69:56.81]Now.
[69:59.05]Who's available?
[70:04.82]This is free leveling up.
[70:11.84]Right when the raid ends.
[70:12.92]Come on.
[70:13.44]Alright.
[70:19.53]Fence.
[70:20.59]No, you know what?
[70:22.77]No.
[70:24.77]You just... You go and mine.
[70:26.55]That's what you're gonna do.
[70:28.41]Just run with all your dumb shit and find a vein and just sit there and smash on it.
[70:38.33]Is there any other veins?
[70:45.11]Max.
[70:46.49]The Drifter.
[70:51.43]I can't fight this guy, so I'm not even going to.
[70:52.99]I need a vein.
[70:53.53]Right there.
[70:54.01]There's a copper vein right here.
[70:56.15]Just sit here for eternity.
[71:02.84]Yeah.
[71:03.28]Just sit there for eternity.
[71:05.18]What are you up to?
[71:05.74]How you doing?
[71:07.56]You need... I can't really build much.

[71:52.58]Yeah.
[71:57.67]Let's go.
[72:00.97]We'll check back on you guys in a second.
[72:06.49]Why do I wear the same three shirts?
[72:07.95]Because I only have three shirts.
[72:10.77]I have Nightwing, Aquaman, and Captain America.
[72:13.71]And then a bunch of Star Wars t-shirts.
[72:18.69]What's going on out here?
[72:19.39]And then I have three dress shirts and four V-necks.
[72:28.17]Two pairs of jeans.
[72:30.31]Three pairs of slacks.
[72:32.64]And... Uh... Her sunglasses.
[72:38.20]You don't need much.
[72:40.14]You really don't need much.
[72:49.43]No, I'm just gonna wait.
[72:49.97]I'm gonna wait till I have the opportunity.
[72:53.21]Can I train anything or do anything?
[72:56.48]Maybe I can steal.
[73:00.22]Steal?
[73:00.62]You're still hungry?
[73:01.72]Here, eat like a fucking food cube.
[73:06.00]Actually, I can't.
[73:09.64]The dog can't even come inside.
[73:13.41]If I drop a food cube on the ground, is the dog gonna eat it?
[73:19.15]No.
[73:21.25]I... Did I just steal that?
[73:23.35]I don't get it.
[73:23.83]What?
[73:33.80]It's... I don't understand why... We're in the same party.
[73:36.00]Why can't he eat the food cube?
[73:40.78]They have cactus rum.
[73:42.24]That's pretty cool.
[73:45.30]Alright, how are we doing on the mining?
[73:47.68]Yeah, it's another mine stream, I know.
[73:49.44]I know every Kenshi stream turns into a mine stream.
[73:58.15]But, I need, I need the money.
[74:00.59]You know what I mean?
[74:09.73]That's almost gone.
[74:14.20]Sell the armor?
[74:15.00]I can't.
[74:15.62]Wait, hold on.
[74:16.76]Can't sell the armor until I can unlock the fence.
[74:22.16]So I can make sure.
[74:23.20]Because I've got to run down and track down a fence.
[74:25.97]I've got to check every bar, every location, go to a different town.
[74:29.15]They're hard to track down.
[74:31.25]Sometimes they're just not in the places you think they are.
[74:33.79]So, there's a 27% chance that I can sell this to an actual vendor, so I'm not gonna do that.
[74:38.15]I'm just gonna save scum for like 30 minutes?
[74:39.91]No.
[74:40.67]Just do this, get the money from the vein, then after this we can get out of here.
[74:45.89]Sell that stuff, join the Thieves Guild, and then... Wreck!
[74:50.75]You know what I mean?
[74:52.51]I'm actually in the way of the notifications, aren't I?
[74:57.26]You can sell all the... You can sell the items at the Hub's Bar, they buy stolen items.
[75:02.80]Yeah, but also remember, I have the items over here, so I have to run these items all the way down here.
[75:12.49]There's a vein right outside this town.
[75:15.73]I mean, let me just, hold on.
[75:18.19]I have to bring them down here anyways.
[75:20.65]So just, I'm gonna sit here for a second.
[75:22.61]I'm gonna have these two do something else.
[75:27.99]I gotta run to the hub anyways.
[75:29.01]Yeah, well, hold on.
[75:29.71]Let me at least run to the hub with some copper.
[75:32.88]Because I'm standing right in front of a vein.
[75:34.46]That's 80% quality.
[75:38.74]The Thieves Guild actually gives you plus 50% profits, by the way.
[75:42.42]Oh, that's awesome to hear.
[75:43.28]That's amazing.
[75:44.26]I can't wait to do it.
[75:49.38]Let's x3 that.
[75:51.22]And... What can you guys do in the meantime over here?
[75:54.86]I just want, like, two stacks of copper.
[75:57.10]And that's it.
[75:59.24]There's copper outside the hub...
[76:08.91]That's iron.
[76:18.15]Iron.
[76:22.19]It's iron.
[76:22.69]It's copper right here.
[76:26.49]Okay.
[76:27.67]Alright.
[76:28.01]Alright.
[76:29.21]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[76:33.05]I almost just said something.
[76:36.42]So glad I didn't.
[76:38.20]Alright, let's go.
[76:38.90]Take it over there.
[76:39.70]Go to the town.
[76:40.46]Go to the hub.
[76:41.00]I need this... We just wait for this last bar to fill.
[76:47.96]And then we're gonna go from here.
[76:54.42]Three, two, one... Go.
[76:57.89]Okay.
[76:59.91]You guys are done?
[77:02.17]Run to the hub.
[77:03.11]Hopefully there's nobody in the way.
[77:04.71]I gotta get there before it gets dark.
[77:09.98]In the meantime, why don't you... You go out there and just start mining.
[77:15.65]I guess there's two people that can be on it.
[77:16.87]Might as well just improve your mining skill while I have you here.
[77:19.85]Chatham.
[77:22.21]Or was it back here?
[77:23.89]Where was it?
[77:25.85]It was kind of up in the corner, wasn't it?
[77:27.50]Somewhere.
[77:28.20]Oh.
[77:29.78]Oh, Jeremy, did you lose your place?
[77:31.86]Where the hell is it right there?
[77:36.42]That's iron.
[77:38.14]Isn't it right here?
[77:38.74]There it is.
[77:41.26]You go mine this.
[77:43.92]Now.
[77:45.73]Times 25,000 speed.
[77:50.45]Bring the dog too for a company just in case something bad happens.
[77:55.21]Let me check and make sure you guys are making it.
[77:57.31]Not with any impeding factors here.
[78:00.37]And you guys are far away from each other, so I have to... What's going on here?
[78:06.92]You're both on sprint, but yeah, you gotta match the speed together here.
[78:14.86]Oh shit.
[78:15.86]Are those bad?
[78:18.02]Yeah, stay the fuck away from those.
[78:19.32]15 attack, 14 strength, no thanks.
[78:23.82]Alright, match speed.
[78:29.08]Looks good.
[78:29.56]I'm gonna get attacked.
[78:30.76]I know it.
[78:34.02]I'm staying with these two because I'm terrified of somebody just popping out of nowhere.
[78:44.13]Small iron, not worth stopping.
[78:47.93]Save this shit.
[78:54.11]Why are we counting?
[78:56.07]What's happening?
[78:56.91]Why are you counting?
[79:01.80]The streamer gnomes somebody?
[79:03.56]When did I... Oh, he's gonna sing a dumb song.
[79:09.98]Okay, speed it up.
[79:15.06]She's mining down at the copper.
[79:16.76]I left Frogmust going to town.
[79:20.08]I know, I left Canned Roth going to town with the goods.
[79:24.60]He's got them all anyways.
[79:28.62]What's going on?
[79:30.66]Did I miss something here?
[79:32.45]What did I miss?
[79:38.47]I must have missed something.
[79:47.49]You know what my favorite part about this stream is?
[79:49.11]Uh, the fact that... Wait.
[79:52.23]Yeah, okay.
[79:56.25]Does anyone remember what I did, like, two hours ago?
[79:58.18]You guys remember that, right?
[80:03.24]I almost forgot that I did that shit.
[80:08.58]Alright.
[80:09.08]Time to sell.
[80:10.94]Sell at the bar.
[80:12.24]Which is down here...
[80:23.92]I wish I could forget.
[80:25.08]I will never forget.
[80:26.02]Who are you?
[80:31.32]Nobody of interest.
[80:31.96]Sell.
[80:34.85]It's time to join the guild.
[80:35.83]We got everybody here too, so that's good.
[80:37.19]9600.
[80:37.21]Stolen goods, no problem.
[80:45.95]1500. 2000.
[80:53.96]But I wonder if some of these are worth keeping.
[81:08.45]Which one of these should I actually keep?
[81:10.31]This thing is...
[81:22.04]Somebody could just wear this and be protected.
[81:24.89]Alright, get this out of here.
[81:44.44]Because that's faction, right?
[81:47.72]I don't want anyone to know where I am and who I am.
[81:52.36]Faction uniform.
[81:54.26]Yeah, get this out of here.
[82:00.90]I don't want to have... Now here come the letters.
[82:05.70]I got 10,000, but let's see.
[82:09.66]This is one... This weighs... This is such a good piece of armor.
[82:15.31]Put this one on.
[82:16.33]This thing is one kilogram.
[82:19.89]And it's got great resistance.
[82:25.14]I'm putting this one on.
[82:30.72]Am I gonna have to go nuclear on this chat?
[82:40.93]I-I-Am I gonna have to go nuclear here?
[82:42.61]Ssssss.
[82:56.30]Buttons on the desk.
[82:57.62]I can press it right now.
[83:00.20]I can go... Don't make me do it.
[83:09.14]Do it, you coward.
[83:19.95]So this is a chest piece, right?
[83:24.04]I think we're good.
[83:24.86]I want... I want to wear this stuff because it's very, very good.
[83:30.00]Do something funny.
[83:45.75]The Holy Chest is really bad.
[83:48.41]Well then, fine.
[83:51.43]It's gonna go right now.
[83:52.63]You ready?
[84:20.34]It's gone.
[84:29.00]Time to buy.
[84:29.68]Let's go.
[84:31.74]Actually, everyone meet up together so we can do this at the same time.
[84:34.46]Because there's training dummies in there and shit.
[84:38.20]Jerma is as bad as chat making random exclamations.
[84:42.79]I'm just trying to keep order.
[84:45.91]Alright, where is it?
[84:46.77]Tower.
[84:47.49]So everybody meet up over here.
[84:52.01]No, you stay... Hold on a second.
[84:55.41]Stay there for a sec.
[84:58.79]Dog can go.
[84:59.33]Let's get that last piece of copper.
[85:09.33]Get to the tower.
[85:10.01]Let's join the guild.
[85:15.51]The first time our crew has been together in probably like ten days.
[85:19.03]No, like three days.
[85:21.21]Dog is getting hurt.
[85:23.24]Dog's fine.
[85:25.50]Where?
[85:28.06]Dog's alright.
[85:31.50]Dog's not getting hurt.
[85:33.56]Dog's just hungry.
[85:37.28]Why did you leave him?
[85:38.66]Leave who?
[85:41.34]Everybody's fine.
[85:41.94]What are you guys on about?
[85:45.16]I want to make sure we're all here.
[85:50.68]Where are you going?
[85:53.08]Oh, it's because you're on bodyguard, right?
[85:54.34]Okay.
[85:56.04]Okay, so... Kind of an odd route, but I'll take it.
[86:04.48]Okay.
[86:04.64]Okay.
[86:08.24]We made it.
[86:09.20]Here we go.
[86:10.28]All four of us are here.
[86:12.64]The four useless dickheads.
[86:16.89]I would like to join the guild.
[86:18.59]Thief boss.
[86:19.25]I want to join the thieves.
[86:21.37]You can join for a fee.
[86:23.55]10,000 cats.
[86:27.09]Can I negotiate?
[86:34.14]What if I said no?
[86:47.54]I'm gonna join.
[86:49.66]And 10,000 is a little steep.
[86:54.14]You're not a very good thief if you can't afford it.
[86:57.16]Done.
[86:58.44]Welcome, brother, to the Shinobi Thieves.
[87:02.51]Shinobi Thieves are now your allies.
[87:03.97]That was a lot of money.
[87:13.59]Wow.
[87:14.11]Okay, now what do I get?
[87:16.23]Follow.
[87:16.96]We can go in.
[87:17.54]All of us.
[87:17.98]Everybody get in.
[87:19.90]Look it.
[87:22.28]Who are you?
[87:25.31]Where are my allies?
[87:27.31]Guild Plastic Surgeon.
[87:30.63]No, I don't want my face changed.
[87:33.47]So what do I get for $10,000?
[87:37.41]Trader.
[87:37.77]Let's take a look.
[87:40.69]What?
[87:42.35]I have something to trade.
[87:47.57]Um, hello?
[87:51.45]Excuse me.
[87:53.96]Uh, take a look.
[87:57.32]Ooh.
[87:58.80]Stolen goods, no problem.
[87:59.92]So let me take a look here, because this is important.
[88:03.26]Minus 50%.
[88:06.03]Why minus?
[88:06.71]I thought you guys said I got a plus 50%.
[88:12.81]Minus 50?
[88:24.56]These are actually pretty good.
[88:27.82]No one said plus.
[88:29.34]People just said 50.
[88:33.47]50 plus taxes.
[88:36.96]Whatever.
[88:40.38]Oh, but there's a discount on everything.
[88:43.38]Oh.
[88:44.52]Alright, let's... I got a little bit of money.
[88:49.18]Let's buy some good armor here.
[88:51.16]Getting rid of this shit, right?
[88:53.34]I guess this is alright.
[88:55.00]This is 16%, 32%.
[88:55.30]And it's three.
[88:55.76]And it's a chest.
[89:03.25]This is... Where does this go?
[89:04.24]Here?
[89:05.50]Yeah.
[89:06.86]Okay, I'm gonna get rid of this dumb thing, because why the hell do I even have this on?
[89:11.48]Let's get rid of all this shit.
[89:14.44]Except for this.
[89:14.90]So I'm gonna wear this stuff.
[89:18.35]Somebody else is gonna wear this one.
[89:20.45]Wait, this is a shirt.
[89:24.49]Only the strongest deserves this.
[89:28.84]So what do I want to get for you?
[89:29.76]16%, 26%, 800, no, it's 30, 300, no, fuck that, too much.
[89:32.14]11, 17, 5 kilograms.
[89:32.84]That's not bad.
[89:33.68]That's affordable, in a way.
[89:34.70]16, 24, 4 kilograms.
[90:01.30]I think I'm gonna buy this.
[90:04.14]You're doing a great job idling.
[90:12.24]Stealth effect.
[90:14.26]Assassinate.
[90:15.16]Melee attack bonus.
[90:16.36]Look at that shit.
[90:17.18]Look at that.
[90:20.03]Oh, man.
[90:22.01]3200.
[90:22.71]Look at that attack bonus.
[90:27.19]Give it to me.
[90:31.25]Alright, I need to figure out who's going to wear this shit.
[90:38.60]You are the strongest.
[90:41.76]So I think you should wear this all.
[90:49.24]Let's see.
[90:49.80]So this is the armor you got right now.
[90:51.30]Melee defense plus 5.
[90:52.74]Melee defense plus 4.
[90:56.60]But this is way better in regards to resistance.
[91:00.64]Let's just see what happens.
[91:02.92]Boom.
[91:03.94]14 plus 8.
[91:08.65]Total weight.
[91:09.43]Oh, you're going to have to walk around like an idiot, though, because you can't... Too heavy.
[91:24.22]Too heavy.
[91:29.29]She has to walk around with this heavy stuff on for a little bit.
[91:35.25]Acid, 40%.
[91:35.85]How much is this way?
[91:40.78]You can take that off for now.
[91:58.85]Melee defense bonus.
[92:02.61]You're the mule, so this is going to go to frog.
[92:10.43]What's going on here?
[92:15.03]Oh, it's going to be outside.
[92:18.99]I get it, okay.
[92:19.29]I need to be closer.
[92:23.47]Alright, so you're going to put this on.
[92:27.98]Because, total weight... Okay.
[92:35.10]12 and a 25.
[92:45.08]Just go!
[92:47.28]This is the game.
[92:49.58]This is what you do.
[92:51.33]There's nowhere to- There's nowhere to go!
[92:54.63]This is where we are.
[92:58.08]This is game.
[92:59.56]This is where we are.
[93:00.53]Uh-oh.
[93:06.01]Alright.
[93:10.94]So, everyone's got good stuff on.
[93:12.90]Except the dog can't really... Can't have anything.
[93:16.24]Need to walk around to make it so that... Build strength with the heavy shit on.
[93:24.02]You just suck because you're carrying all the items.
[93:26.44]9 plus 8.
[93:28.32]14 plus 8.
[93:29.64]Let's take a look upstairs.
[93:32.79]There's a training dummy up there.
[93:33.83]Uh, I can't... I don't want to steal from the place that I just got accepted to.
[93:41.17]That would be a really bad idea, wouldn't it?
[93:44.66]Let's explore the tower, though.
[93:51.98]Oh, shit.
[93:52.46]What is this?
[93:55.76]Can I use these?
[93:57.24]Locksmith Training Box?
[93:58.54]Locksmith Training Box 2.
[94:01.12]Oh no.
[94:02.99]Training Dummy.
[94:04.29]Training Dummy.
[94:05.11]Assassination Dummy 2.
[94:08.91]MK1.
[94:10.45]Training Dummy 2.
[94:11.75]Fuck.
[94:20.30]Here we go again.
[94:27.38]This is so much in here.
[94:30.44]What's in the top floor?
[94:31.76]Beds?
[94:32.38]I can sleep.
[94:34.16]Finally.
[94:36.24]Alright.
[94:39.02]Everybody up here?
[94:39.69]What are you... What's wrong with you?
[94:44.55]Get up there.
[94:48.59]It's time to train.
[94:49.69]Only one person at a time?
[94:51.49]Only one person at a time, so the person that needs to be there the most, get there.
[94:56.75]Do you even have a weapon?
[95:01.87]What is this?
[95:02.37]Is this doing stealth?
[95:04.59]No.
[95:05.05]Melee attack.
[95:09.01]Defense, dodge, martial arts.
[95:10.55]What is it leveling up here?
[95:17.69]Is it just attack?
[95:19.67]Or is it assassination?
[95:20.45]Okay, it's assassination.
[95:25.34]Alright, nice.
[95:26.82]Stealthy knockouts.
[95:27.80]Chance to successfully kidnap somebody.
[95:29.36]Chance to break free when being carried away.
[95:30.90]Resist knockout.
[95:35.84]So, are there any other training dummies I can use that will level up the just general skill?
[95:40.63]Or no?
[95:45.97]Well, let's do the harder lockpicking then.
[95:51.09]Or maybe I can't do that yet.
[95:55.80]Am I too high already?
[96:01.22]I might be too high.
[96:01.92]Let me see.
[96:07.22]Because my lockpick is at 22.
[96:10.30]I think I'm too high.
[96:13.50]You can do the better dummies with tech too, plus research.
[96:19.79]What is this?
[96:20.37]How about you on this one?
[96:24.29]No, he's not too high.
[96:27.03]Alright.
[96:34.42]Click on it, and in the bottom left is max training.
[96:36.68]Ah, I see.
[96:36.94]20, right.
[96:37.10]10, 5, 19.
[96:37.20]19 assassination.
[96:37.70]Alright.
[96:55.27]Uh, it looks like we're all going to be assassins.
[97:02.21]I need you to go do something.
[97:04.61]Because you're kind of just standing around.
[97:05.73]We need food.
[97:06.41]Are we out of food?
[97:08.31]No, we got a little bit of food.
[97:09.45]Who's hungry?
[97:11.25]Dog's hungry.
[97:11.89]Everybody's hungry.
[97:12.63]Everybody wants food.
[97:13.38]This has got to go into his backpack.
[97:20.40]Back into the backpack with a few cubes in there.
[97:26.36]Who's eating everybody except... I need the dog to eat.
[97:31.37]So go down and feed the dog, please.
[97:33.75]While you two keep training.
[97:38.11]Dog?
[97:38.39]What?
[97:38.79]My dog's not allowed in there?
[97:39.87]That's kind of bullshit.
[97:40.97]If you ask me.
[97:46.26]Dog is just eating.
[97:47.04]Good.
[97:47.22]Good.
[97:49.80]So we got... Strength will go up when the food is better.
[97:53.86]When it's eaten.
[97:54.66]9 plus 8.
[97:56.20]14 plus 8.
[97:57.98]I'm kind of getting to be alright.
[98:01.88]I'm getting to be worth walking around.
[98:09.52]So speaking of walking around... How much money do I have?
[98:12.72]592.
[98:12.74]How much food do I have on these two?
[98:21.55]Couple of food cubes.
[98:23.59]I still have this.
[98:24.29]I should just put it on.
[98:27.69]Six plus four.
[98:28.38]At least I have some defense now.
[98:31.34]While they train up there.
[98:37.88]Who else?
[98:38.58]I mean, what else can I even do?
[98:39.80]Let me just check the other spots.
[98:41.00]I need to know.
[98:42.98]I just paid ten grand.
[98:48.96]Let's go all the way up.
[98:49.94]We're at least in the next room.
[98:52.44]What's up here?
[98:55.48]Steal from the Assassin League.
[98:57.62]That's a... I'm not doing that.
[98:59.32]This is all the way up.
[99:02.86]I can sleep.
[99:04.93]Maybe the dog should sleep.
[99:09.43]Sounds like a plan.
[99:11.33]The dog can't sleep in that bed.
[99:13.31]The dog can't come in here.
[99:18.19]Well, never mind on that front.
[99:20.92]Let's just go out.
[99:24.66]I need more money.
[99:26.26]So, you two... What are you at right now for lockpicking?
[99:34.30]What's your skill?
[99:35.08]Lockpicking 11, so I can do this 10 more times.
[99:38.12]What are you at for assassination?
[99:39.12]6.
[99:40.29]You're gonna be here for a while.
[99:44.25]Good luck.
[99:45.73]You're both gonna be here for a little while.
[99:48.65]In the meantime...
[99:55.38]Hmm, what am I gonna do in the meantime?
[99:56.98]They're gonna have to trade off.
[100:00.52]I need money.
[100:00.98]I need food.
[100:01.78]Hmm.
[100:16.09]Make canned raw- Oh, never mind.
[100:18.11]I'm not gonna read that one.
[100:21.67]The two of you just go.
[100:22.45]They'll be fine.
[100:23.35]They're not, like, hungry yet.
[100:27.30]Probably should... Is it like a general... Is it really that... What?
[100:37.58]That's kind of fucked up.
[100:38.86]Okay.
[100:40.36]Twitchy Barthug.
[100:42.70]I don't like that look in your eyes.
[100:44.52]Scum sucker, you smirking at me.
[100:47.78]You got tasty looking eyeballs.
[100:52.96]Uh... Crack your knuckles.
[100:55.34]I just wanted to buy a drink.
[100:56.56]I was, uh, just admiring your sword, that's all.
[101:04.24]Uh, what's the... What do you got for, like, attack?
[101:06.04]I don't want to start a fight here.
[101:07.22]What does this guy have for attack?
[101:10.75]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[101:12.47]Maybe I should.
[101:12.99]You got tasty-looking eyeballs.
[101:18.67]Fourteen +2?
[101:21.82]Six plus four?
[101:23.80]Stay the hell away from me.
[101:28.40]The dog's got attacked.
[101:29.46]We could have probably done it.
[101:35.66]So, I need to... Let me check over here.
[101:49.64]Oh, this guy got up!
[101:50.46]He actually got up!
[101:53.28]Wait, wait, wait!
[101:53.96]Wait a minute!
[101:54.48]Hold on.
[101:56.72]Get over there.
[101:57.18]Get this guy.
[101:57.73]Come here.
[101:58.05]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[102:01.81]Get over to that guy right now.
[102:11.87]Alright.
[102:13.33]What's the plan here?
[102:17.48]Unlock shackles.
[102:23.92]I'm going to unlock his shackles.
[102:25.78]Let's save it.
[102:29.37]And then, maybe, will he join me?
[102:33.29]I could probably get another party member here.
[102:35.37]Let's wait until he gets out of sight.
[102:43.17]Once we get out of the... Is he trying to escape right now?
[102:47.08]I'm not sure.
[102:47.76]Are there any guards?
[102:57.38]This is an escape.
[103:09.18]90% chance well stop moving man.
[103:11.38]What are you doing?
[103:14.56]Got it Kill I can't like talk to him.
[103:32.75]I
[104:21.92]Can I not?
[104:24.62]I undid his shackles and he's going back in here.
[104:28.96]For what reason are you doing this?
[104:32.02]It's because I have a negative attack value.
[104:33.92]Yeah, but I... yeah.
[104:35.08]This guy's good.
[104:39.05]I can't have this guy in a party or something.
[104:43.53]Well, whatever.
[104:44.49]Good luck.
[104:49.71]Take care of yourself.
[104:51.39]Have a good, have a nice life.
[104:56.36]There's a chance that they'll join you, they aren't assured to.
[104:59.12]I guess that makes sense.
[104:59.86]Alright, how are we doing up here?
[105:05.87]Block picking 12.
[105:09.13]And you are at assassination 9.
[105:15.51]What the hell are you two gonna do in the meantime?
[105:17.37]Can the dog train?
[105:18.65]I know, it doesn't even matter.
[105:19.77]Dog can't even train on it because dog can't go in there.
[105:25.78]How much money do I have?
[105:26.56]Alright, it's almost time to go and try to fight.
[105:33.24]Go on an expedition where the purpose is to get in a fight.
[105:36.88]I just need a little bit of... Who's malnourished?
[105:40.13]I need to get a couple more pieces of food.
[105:42.75]And then we're going outside and I'm gonna start a fight and just try to level up.
[105:48.17]So, let's get some food.
[105:52.55]Uh, does the... is there a trader in here that serves food?
[105:58.65]Or does he just do... Does he just do clothes?
[106:09.36]Nah, you just have clothing.
[106:13.14]Oh well.
[106:16.12]Gotta go to the bar for the food.
[106:18.88]But that's too much money.
[106:22.90]And then we're gonna go on an expedition and we're gonna fight.
[106:24.87]Even if I lose?
[106:26.11]Good.
[106:27.27]How much health do I have?
[106:28.41]Plenty.
[106:31.93]Come on down.
[106:32.39]I have to put on the fight music.
[106:41.54]Good to see ya.
[106:45.00]I hate how I have to walk around in a circle.
[106:46.71]Alright, we got dried meat.
[106:48.83]Take it.
[106:50.21]Fish.
[106:51.01]Ah, that's... I don't have enough money for this.
[106:52.59]I only... I don't... I only have one food cube.
[107:01.60]I can afford one of these.
[107:03.78]Okay.
[107:25.71]That's all I can get.
[107:26.49]The green fruit doesn't do anything.
[107:32.49]Steel.
[107:33.39]I mean, that's easier said than done.
[107:36.20]This grog that I could take.
[107:46.94]There's too many people in here.
[107:58.53]Go upstairs.
[108:00.57]Anything up here?
[108:01.98]No.
[108:03.84]I mean... They're not looking this way.
[108:06.66]Save it right here, just because I might be able to pull something out of here.
[108:08.58]What's in here?
[108:10.60]First aid.
[108:11.98]51% chance to steal it.
[108:12.92]That's bad.
[108:13.44]Alright, here we go.
[108:14.70]There's food.
[108:16.71]Stealing chance 53%.
[108:17.35]It's saved right here, right?
[108:23.83]Let's try it.
[108:26.23]Random furniture!
[108:30.17]Okay, hold on.
[108:32.42]Okay, I got it.
[108:34.50]What is random furniture?
[108:41.52]Display stand, interior wall, support beam.
[108:44.92]Tech level 2.
[108:45.82]Needs research bench level 2.
[108:49.48]I got it, whatever the hell it is.
[108:56.22]Well, I got one piece of food.
[109:00.06]It's not gonna do very much for me, though.
[109:09.88]We might have to actually go to one of the other smaller towns and just try to steal all their stuff.
[109:14.98]Yeah, I got enough food to last at least one small expedition to the next town.
[109:25.45]That's a lot of residents, Seligris.
[109:46.23]I missed a free recruit in this bar?
[109:58.47]And why am I still sneaking?
[109:59.73]Stand up.
[110:03.15]Free recruit.
[110:04.92]This guy's not free.
[110:05.72]6000 cats.

[110:52.99]I don't see a Hobbs.
[110:55.17]I see Hungry.
[111:01.02]This is, uh, Holy Citizen.
[111:10.02]Hobbs.
[111:23.58]Yes, that's it.
[111:24.42]Have a drink on me.
[111:25.34]Say, have you ever heard of the story of the Wailing Phantom?
[111:28.72]Oh, what's it about?
[111:30.00]Well, legend has it it dwells in a sunken cave south of the Outlands, where it has bones made of solid diamond.
[111:36.69]Just one tooth would fetch you kabillions, no, poobillions, of cats.
[111:41.29]It has the gigantic tongue of a lusty tree hag and a marvelous pair of bingo wings that droop like smooth potato butter.
[111:49.15]Some even say that it has the snout of fondled truffle.
[111:52.28]Even the most handsomest of man-warriors haven't been able to hunt the peppery thing down.
[111:56.46]What is this?
[111:57.34]This is a strange way to talk.
[112:00.30]That sounds amazing.
[112:01.28]How do I find it?
[112:05.03]If I knew that, I would have tracked it down myself.
[112:06.91]But if you're going to head out in search of it, you must take me with you.
[112:09.95]Call it an old man's dying wish.
[112:15.17]Then I will grant you your wish.
[112:17.16]Join us in search of the beast!

[112:49.48]Take him to the Thieves Guild for Plastic Surgery.
[112:51.70]Oh, yeah, alright.
[112:52.74]That sounds fun.
[112:53.90]New party member.
[112:54.64]Good.
[112:55.68]Now...
[112:59.67]You know, now somebody can die, right?
[113:01.75]I won't feel that bad.
[113:06.60]Where's the plastic surgeon?
[113:15.40]Where the hell are you?
[113:23.87]Alright, Hobbs.
[113:26.72]Uh, there's the trader.
[113:27.54]The plastic surgeon was sitting here before.
[113:34.54]Plastic surgeon, where are you?
[113:41.37]There you are.
[113:42.97]Need your face changed.
[113:43.85]Yes, help me out.
[113:44.53]Here we go.
[113:44.89]Okay.
[113:47.68]Name?
[113:48.62]Well, I gotta change the name, too.
[114:17.28]So much for normal.
[114:21.30]Why does everybody have to have this?
[114:27.58]That hurts.
[114:31.34]I just hurt my back doing that.
[114:32.58]Alright, we got it.
[114:38.21]Let's do small.
[114:47.53]Chest?
[114:48.23]Oy.
[114:49.67]What happened over here?
[114:52.33]What's this?
[114:55.44]How's that chest?
[115:40.65]Slender man Hmm
[116:10.81]It's just a Kingdom Hearts character now.
[116:31.70]No, that's fine.
[116:32.30]I think that's alright.
[116:47.02]They all have this.
[116:48.34]Can one of my characters not have this?
[116:52.29]They all have the horizontal neck.
[116:55.85]Every one of them.
[116:57.70]Every single one of them.
[117:37.40]Oh my god, what the hell am I doing?
[117:47.81]Not bad.
[118:09.67]It's another Dr. House.
[118:15.07]It's Dr. House again.
[118:18.15]Every character I make is Dr. House, and then I make it somebody else afterwards.
[118:21.59]That looks good.
[118:36.80]Alright, I like that.
[118:44.16]Looks alright.
[118:53.37]This is one of Roger's characters from American Dead.
[119:13.20]That's bad.
[119:25.31]No, no Mohawk.
[119:29.37]Oh, that's bad too.
[119:36.39]It kind of has to be Roger.
[119:45.30]In fact, I think I have to go back and just make him Roger.
[120:04.64]Please don't go for the low-hanging fruit.
[120:31.02]No, no YouTuber hair.
[120:33.12]Just regular.
[120:36.40]That's fine.
[120:36.84]Now we need to do beard.
[120:55.70]No.
[120:58.30]Why does it look like you?
[121:02.76]It shouldn't.
[121:09.03]Alright, that does not look like me.
[121:12.24]Give me a break.
[121:12.78]You think this looks like me?
[121:47.87]It fucking kinda does.
[121:49.29]A little bit.
[122:02.54]I like the no beard though.
[122:03.66]No mustache, no beard, none of them.
[122:16.82]Alright, looks fine.
[122:18.70]We're done.
[122:25.50]Name?
[122:38.47]Decrease the height.
[122:56.12]Come on, that's like a Roger name.
[122:59.80]That's me, part of his gold standard, right?
[123:07.16]That would be, oh, you can't even see the name.
[123:12.55]That's a Roger persona name, right?
[123:20.99]Take off the hat, I will.
[123:29.25]Give him the Roger proportions.
[123:30.83]I can't just make Roger... Let's just see what it looks like.
[123:38.84]I'm as corny as Kansas in August.
[123:46.66]I'm as normal...
[123:59.78]Perfect music.
[124:01.28]Taller.
[124:01.90]There, there you go.
[124:04.82]Barnabas Gold standard.
[124:31.11]One of Roger from American Dad's personas.
[124:55.12]I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May, a cliché coming true.
[125:02.13]I'm bromidic and bright as the moon, happy night pouring light on the dew.
[125:09.23]I'm as corny as Kansas in August, high as a flag on the 4th of July.
[125:16.06]If you'll excuse an excuse.
[125:37.60]Look at us down here.
[125:43.39]15 plus 12.
[125:44.29]Where did that come from?
[125:45.15]I have 85 cents.
[126:03.74]What do you have for attack?
[126:05.68]Seven.
[126:06.02]Alright, field medic six, five.
[126:09.34]-2, lockpicking.
[126:10.80]Terrible.
[126:12.00]Melee attack seven, defense six.
[126:15.01]Uh, you're gonna... Excuse me, Marcus.
[126:16.69]You need to go over here.
[126:19.33]Keep him unarmed.
[126:21.09]Oh, you better believe it.
[126:21.93]Why is his training going down?
[126:32.86]I had to go negative to go positive.
[126:40.56]Okay.
[126:45.60]I guess so.
[126:46.54]Where are you at?
[126:52.12]Looking good.
[126:54.73]12 assassination.
[126:58.06]If you are in stealth mode, you can sneak up behind people and knock them out.
[127:00.42]This skill determines how long they stay unconscious for.
[127:02.80]Good.
[127:07.58]I hate all these motherfuckers.
[127:13.53]The dog's probably the only one that I actually like.
[127:17.17]They're all so fucking bad.
[127:20.83]Okay.
[127:27.05]Mad of Chatham is actually not bad either.
[127:29.14]Alright, we have our designated mule.
[127:36.28]If you kidnap somebody, you can practice assassination on them forever.
[127:40.90]Yeah, but that's mean.
[127:42.70]This is free.
[127:46.48]Alright, here we go.
[127:48.02]I think it's time to get going.
[127:50.16]We got a team here.
[127:51.15]And what was the super secret treasure area?
[127:53.29]That guy was talking about something, right?
[128:02.92]What was, where was that?
[128:04.12]Didn't he say that there was some magical Brazilian treasure?
[128:06.48]Wait, is it somewhere in the middle?
[128:10.40]Like here?
[128:11.34]Hold on, I gotta, I gotta turn the camera off for a second.
[128:15.44]Oh, I can't even, never mind, I can't even turn the camera off.
[128:17.31]Well, it's a good song.
[128:26.53]Uh, I don't know a good song.
[128:32.34]Time for a sneeze.
[128:36.03]Alright, um, is this even doing anything for you?
[128:39.15]Plus six perception, I guess.
[128:40.57]Alright, I don't want to run out of food.
[128:46.45]Everybody, let's go.
[128:47.15]Forget about your training.
[128:48.46]You're good enough.
[128:50.46]It's time to figure it out where we're gonna go.
[128:54.74]We are playing Fallout now, apparently.
[128:57.98]Where the hell is everybody?
[129:07.12]Uh, guys.
[129:09.38]They're all Roger personas.
[129:11.55]Let me stand... Let me put them all next to each other.
[129:18.61]I don't know.
[129:40.53]Anything goes.
[129:44.01]When the mist is dead, the clay's not blended, and get crushed and spread to yester, then I suppose anything goes.
[129:56.50]When Rockefeller still can pause enough money to let Matt Gordon produce his show, anything goes.
[130:08.29]Where's the dog?
[130:38.18]There you go.
[130:38.90]There they are.
[130:42.12]Oh, look, it's a Roger persona.
[130:43.50]Oh, look, another Roger persona.
[130:44.90]Hey, look, it's me.
[130:45.74]It's me, Roger.
[130:47.76]Alright.
[130:49.24]Time for them all to die.
[130:51.39]Save it.
[130:53.79]Save it.
[131:10.26]I don't know how many we'll die.
[131:15.46]But, who, wait, we still have... I can, hold on a minute.
[131:19.86]Let's go together.
[131:20.50]No, you just stop sprinting everywhere.
[131:24.78]Match each other's speed.
[131:30.77]What have you done?
[131:41.91]I gotta sell, I have, and then buy a couple of pieces of food.
[131:46.12]Fitting music.

[132:46.77]Because... Uh, who had that?
[132:51.55]You?
[132:55.09]As long as the frog stays alive, he'll have all the medical... He's just a mule.
[133:00.86]He's here just to carry items and shit.
[133:02.66]Anybody else have any items?
[133:04.28]Put that back on.
[133:12.54]We're ready.
[133:14.04]I got 580 bucks.
[133:16.64]Let's do a little bit of business.
[133:17.76]I got plenty of heals.
[133:19.94]I got... Food's not that great, but... I could buy one of these.
[133:24.81]And that's a huge amount of nutrition.
[133:27.21]Or I could get two.
[133:29.89]Hmm.
[133:32.71]Just get this.
[133:34.01]Yeah, I'm getting it.
[133:48.88]Nutrition.
[133:51.50]Here we go.
[133:51.98]Let's move out.
[133:54.41]Everybody.
[133:56.39]Oh, I remember this one.
[134:03.69]Butcher.
[134:04.15]Butcher.
[134:04.55]Butcher.
[134:04.89]What?
[134:05.35]Oh, right.
[134:09.09]Time for the crew to do something.
[134:12.09]It's been... How long has it been?
[134:16.59]Two hours?
[134:17.37]Let's go.
[134:19.24]Let's go right to the middle.
[134:25.11]Everyone's fed, everyone's ready to go.
[134:30.17]Save it again.
[134:35.93]If I see a group of bandits, I'm going after them.
[134:43.13]I'm going to tear their skulls off.
[134:47.67]Sounds like me singing.
[134:51.09]We already heard that earlier.
[134:54.31]And it was not, it was not good at all.
[134:58.04]Speed it up!
[135:19.81]What if I just jubate you guys so hard, and all of them just go mine, and I just walk away from the computer?
[135:25.86]Why are you jumping off the cliff here?
[135:29.90]This is not... Where are you going?
[135:35.93]Where are you going?
[135:37.95]Meet up over here, please.
[135:41.87]Wait for the dog.
[135:43.55]How's everybody doing?
[135:46.23]Food, food.
[135:46.98]Some people need to eat here.
[135:48.78]Dust storm.
[135:52.44]Can somebody... I need to give food?
[135:54.94]I got food here.
[135:57.74]Why are you guys not eating this?
[136:00.66]I guess you are.
[136:01.28]Let's move.
[136:01.78]Fast.
[136:14.76]This music actually works here.
[136:43.37]Just check your surroundings every once in a while.
[136:48.83]I don't want to walk into like a mutant.
[136:57.82]Ooh, I'm loading in something.
[137:10.27]That's a long way.
[137:12.99]Long way to go.

[137:29.86]He just hacks, whacks, chopping at me.
[137:32.80]Well, they put him in jail again.
[137:35.84]They tried to give him life.
[137:37.84]He'd beat the case.
[137:39.48]He pleaded insane.
[137:40.68]They gave him back his same old knife.
[137:43.16]He keeps hacking and whacking and smacking.
[137:47.39]Dust boss.
[137:49.81]Kind of getting his ass kicked.
[137:51.99]By two starving bandits.

[141:47.60]This might be winnable.
[141:49.34]It might be.
[141:52.54]Barnabus is doing good.
[141:53.38]This guy's... Eight minus five.
[141:58.22]Tons of defense, though.
[142:01.50]Where are you at?
[142:03.83]You're... Okay.

[142:11.15]This guy needs one hit or so and he's done.

[142:37.00]That's it, right?
[142:37.84]Oh, shit.
[142:38.58]No, you dead?
[142:39.96]I gotta get out of here.
[142:41.74]I have to get the fuck out of here after this guy goes down.

[142:59.61]Nice, dog.
[143:00.51]Couple more hits and we can get the fuck out of here.
[143:02.77]Beautiful.
[143:08.97]That's it.
[143:09.33]That's it.
[143:09.61]That's it.
[143:09.87]That's it.
[143:10.17]One more.
[143:10.55]One more.
[143:11.17]One more.
[143:11.70]Come on.
[143:12.60]Stay up.
[143:13.52]Stay up.
[143:15.28]Who has med kits?
[143:16.72]That's really important.
[143:19.02]I'm going to save something here just because...
[143:40.06]Oh my god.
[143:43.27]That guy's got a hundred dollars.
[143:47.83]Hold on a second.
[143:48.53]Who just gave a hundred fucking dollars?
[143:56.64]Kvas gave a hundred bucks.
[144:00.35]Oh my lord.
[144:02.21]Thank you, Cross, for the hundred dollars.
[144:04.95]Oh my god, I fucking bought these kind of on accident because Twitch said the purchase failed.
[144:09.29]But oh well.
[144:11.70]Uh, love you, Jerma.
[144:12.42]You're still my favorite.
[144:13.24]My dog passed away today, but as long as I got you, I'm good.
[144:16.14]Uh, Nickelodeon.
[144:18.72]Way I got that slime.
[144:21.84]Slat.
[144:24.08]Nickelodeon.
[144:27.48]Uh, I'm sorry, that's terrible to hear.
[144:29.38]Sorry about your dog.
[144:32.40]That sucks, it's always hard, and there's no real easy way to deal with it, you just kind of have to.
[144:36.93]So, I'm terribly fucking sorry to hear that.
[144:43.69]But thank you for the accidental hundred dollars.
[144:47.65]That's a big, that's a big money accident.
[144:52.49]Thank you so much.
[144:53.71]For real.
[144:54.33]Thank you.
[144:57.38]Can I get some Nickelodeon Splats?
[144:59.93]What's the Nickelodeon reference?
[145:06.61]I need to be very cautious with this, because I have... Medkits.
[145:13.18]I got two bodies.
[145:14.88]Two bodies on the ground.
[145:16.42]Two able bodies to carry them.
[145:22.26]That's the first time I've ever had a successful battle, and it feels great.
[145:25.50]It feels actually fucking great.
[145:28.76]Alright, let's get a... I figured Nickelodeon, that just sounded like Nickelodeon.
[145:41.25]This is, we're in Fallout 4.
[145:42.83]This is a Fallout 4 soundtrack.
[145:52.79]Let's just, whoops.
[145:58.63]I kind of don't want this to get claimed, though.
[146:01.03]If I keep playing these, these are claimable songs, I think.
[146:06.49]Are they?
[146:06.97]I'm not even sure anymore.
[146:16.57]Loot the enemies?
[146:17.19]Oh, I'm going to, don't worry.
[146:22.19]New Vegas.
[146:24.35]I'll put on the New Vegas soundtrack in the background here.
[146:29.43]We can just hang out there.
[146:32.17]Alright.
[146:32.81]What?
[146:33.35]Hold on.
[146:33.75]Okay, everyone's fine.
[146:36.95]So, let's... I need to assess the situation here.
[146:39.79]Unconscious.
[146:40.63]Bleeding.
[146:41.61]Almost dead.
[146:44.97]Conscious.
[146:49.14]But, need of attention.
[146:51.66]Unconscious.
[146:52.30]Almost dead.
[146:56.20]Wounded.
[146:57.62]Arms almost gone.
[147:00.57]Wounded, but you're okay.
[147:01.65]So, we gotta deal with the critical injuries here first.
[147:06.68]So, who has decent first aid among you?
[147:11.40]Field medic 6, 5, 10.
[147:15.82]How does a dog have... Oh.
[147:19.89]Field medic 4.
[147:20.69]How does a dog have 10 field medic?
[147:27.48]Turn the music down a little bit.
[147:34.60]That's better.
[147:38.10]So, how's the dog a field medic?
[147:39.50]That's kind of strange.
[147:45.44]Dr. Dog is on the case.
[147:48.92]The dog can't have... Let me just see.
[147:51.96]Before I keep panicking here.
[147:55.45]Now the dog cannot heal anybody.
[147:56.99]So Frog Musk needs to be healed, so it means we're going to take Barnabus as the highest of the two that can carry anything.
[148:05.41]Yeah.
[148:07.74]So Barnabus needs those med packs.
[148:12.86]So go get them.
[148:16.46]You two stop running that way.
[148:19.20]Stay.
[148:19.90]Oh my god, where are you going?
[148:31.38]We got it wrong.
[148:47.07]Get off.
[148:47.55]Is this guy shooting a crossbow?
[148:50.95]He is.
[148:51.23]Fuck.
[149:04.63]I'm gonna have to pick people up.
[149:14.01]This guy's still alive too.
[149:18.68]Okay, here's the plan.
[149:25.06]You got nothing on you of value.
[149:33.56]Holy shit, this thing's actually kind of good.
[149:42.37]Just go into melee?
[149:47.03]I saved it, right?
[149:47.75]But they're all so hurt.
[149:51.65]If I get hit once with an arrow, I'm fucking dead.
[150:00.22]I saved it, though.
[150:00.86]I had it saved.
[150:06.19]Let's go.
[150:14.17]One down.
[150:16.80]Oh my god, there's so many!
[150:19.40]There are so many!
[150:20.98]There's like three more in the trees!
[150:28.20]I gotta have faith.
[150:31.98]Oh my goodness, 18 precision.
[150:49.30]Crossbow.
[150:51.94]Junkbow.
[151:02.72]What is this?
[151:06.86]Armored rag.
[151:08.50]Standard grade.
[151:09.44]Wow, that's kind of good.
[151:10.68]2439.
[151:10.70]It's heavy, but take it.
[151:19.53]What about the boots?
[151:23.48]Too heavy.
[151:23.84]Give me the bolts, too.
[151:32.80]Alright.
[151:33.26]I gotta get out of here.
[151:34.67]They're ranged.
[151:35.41]I think I can outrun them.
[151:37.19]Where is the boss?
[151:39.49]Dust bandit.
[151:41.05]Where's the dust boss?
[151:42.97]Because... Dust boss.
[151:46.72]I got a feeling this guy might have something on him.
[151:51.89]So we're going to run.
[151:54.45]We're going to go to the dust boss, pick up the two, and book it.
[152:08.46]Oh shit, his leg is broken.
[152:09.80]Another one of these.
[152:23.05]Ooh, that's good too.
[152:25.81]Don't... I can't get overburdened on this.
[152:27.95]Who is this?
[152:29.93]Who has this?
[152:30.69]This is Chatham?
[152:33.33]He's overburdened.
[152:35.09]Fuck.
[153:05.71]Let's get out of here.
[153:07.19]I can't risk it.
[153:10.77]I just gotta... Okay, how are you doing?
[153:14.10]Pick up.
[153:15.42]Frog musk is your task.
[153:18.10]Your task is pick up Canberra.
[153:22.75]Pick up.
[153:25.61]Go.
[153:25.69]Go.
[153:33.96]I can't carry anyone with this arm!
[153:35.88]Oh shit!
[154:12.01]How many are following me?
[154:13.60]Three.
[154:15.34]It's very possible that I can...
[154:55.24]I can't kill them.
[154:57.23]Look at my guys.
[154:59.49]I can't even hold a sword.
[155:00.81]These guys are not... Look at the attack.
[155:07.41]16.
[155:07.71]Crossbow is 18.
[155:10.62]I'm fucked.
[155:13.60]15.
[155:13.64]Attack 13.
[155:14.02]How are they doing right now?
[155:20.37]Unconscious.
[155:20.91]He's going to get up.
[155:23.86]Alright, we're just gonna have to try to get out of here.
[155:27.50]Just try to get out.
[155:37.69]I need a town.
[155:41.35]Holy military base.
[155:49.66]Holy shit, he's alive.
[155:50.46]Okay, hold on.
[156:03.27]Frogmusk is currently alive.
[156:11.86]Is there a button I have to press to have him play dead?
[156:18.70]Or is him sneaking play dead?
[156:27.11]He does it automatically.
[156:28.01]Okay.
[156:30.29]Just don't move him.
[156:34.45]This is so stressful.
[156:35.47]I took so much beating and I leveled up probably like three times.
[156:43.45]Why does this keep getting unchecked?
[156:58.80]Oh fu- He just took a fucking shot right in the head.
[157:05.79]sacrifices to get away.
[157:17.22]Frog musk.
[157:17.88]No!
[157:18.36]Get- Frog musk, can you run?
[157:21.30]He's- I think he can run.
[157:34.40]Go!
[157:35.98]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[157:37.21]Alright, we need a location.
[157:45.81]Holy military base?
[157:48.89]Or try to run back to the hub.
[157:56.05]I don't know what to do.
[157:57.03]I don't know what the safe option here is.
[158:02.88]Everybody just try to get back to the hub.
[158:14.62]Good luck.
[158:14.92]Go.
[158:19.96]Oh, Barnabus.
[158:22.00]Miss.
[158:22.92]Miss.
[158:25.92]Yes.
[158:30.26]I think we did it.
[158:30.74]I think we did it.
[158:31.28]I think we did it.
[158:31.74]They're not chasing.
[158:41.38]Get out of there.
[158:44.18]Okay.
[158:46.02]Meet up over here.
[158:47.09]They're not chasing.
[158:52.49]Holy shit.
[158:53.27]Okay, we need to have like a heal party.
[158:55.25]They're not chasing.
[158:56.03]Are they?
[158:56.27]Let me... Is this guy... They're coming this way.
[159:00.53]We gotta keep moving.
[159:05.40]Yeah, they're coming this way.
[159:06.22]We gotta go.
[159:06.88]We gotta get out of here now.
[159:09.34]Out through the little... We can't stop yet.
[159:16.69]And here comes another troop.
[159:19.78]Those are slavers.
[159:21.38]Those are slavers and we got out right at the perfect time.
[159:26.79]Damn.
[159:31.73]They're coming down this way.
[159:45.09]Meet in the middle.
[159:45.65]I gotta splint that leg.
[160:05.84]Fuck.
[160:06.92]Oh, we gotta get out of here.
[160:08.08]I'm gonna save it right here.
[160:15.13]Should I hide?
[160:17.30]What if I like, what if I hide over here?
[160:32.30]No!
[160:32.60]No!
[160:34.26]No, we were so close!
[160:38.33]We were so close to getting out of there!
[160:49.91]Come on!
[160:58.92]Oh!
[161:04.80]Put him down.
[161:25.41]He has all the health packs!
[161:36.43]He's the motherfucker in the road that has the health packs.
[161:41.89]What if they don't- Okay, hold on.
[161:42.97]What if- Can I just be a dead guy in the road?
[161:54.86]They might not see me.
[161:55.94]Alright, nobody fucking move.
[162:28.51]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[162:38.22]Oh, you slow motherfucker.
[162:51.55]What?
[162:51.83]What's going on?
[162:52.71]Why are they running this way?
[162:55.19]That guy died!
[162:56.86]Free.
[163:02.51]They're going that way.
[163:04.74]Alright, let's go.
[163:05.32]Let's go.
[163:05.72]Save.
[163:06.12]Wait.
[163:07.00]He's gonna stand up.
[163:10.42]Go chop that guy's fucking head off.
[163:14.11]Okay, here we go.
[163:15.85]Save this shit right now.
[163:37.96]No, no, I need to give these to you.
[163:41.04]He's the healer.
[163:42.38]Actually, they both can do it at the same time.
[163:47.30]Got splints.
[163:48.94]Okay.
[163:50.08]I'm out of food, too.
[163:53.28]So you, Barnabas, take care of Kandroth.
[164:00.99]Madam, you need to heal Frogmusk.
[164:07.54]I'll have to hit play.
[164:11.29]Okay.
[164:11.69]What do you got?
[164:14.17]I need a couple of these.
[164:32.85]Alright, who's... Okay, we got leg, head.
[164:35.55]Okay, he's not dying anymore.
[164:38.23]Dog is okay.
[164:43.19]Left arm.
[164:44.09]You gotta splint that shit, don't you?
[164:48.17]First aid.
[164:49.91]Pick up first aid.
[164:51.13]Go over here to Frogmusk.
[164:56.50]Alright, you gotta... If we're gonna stop sneaking now...
[165:05.05]First aid.
[165:10.59]Heal that arm first.
[165:11.41]You're gonna be fucking useless without it.
[165:19.07]How do I heal that arm?
[165:22.47]Splint the arm.
[165:29.80]Do I not have any more splints?
[165:36.31]Bottom right.
[165:37.49]Medic.
[165:38.99]Press this button will auto your selected characters to automatically heal everyone in the squad.
[165:41.79]Okay.
[165:42.31]No, no, no.
[165:42.59]But that wouldn't... I need to heal myself.
[165:44.65]Why can I not splint my own injury?
[165:47.99]Is it splinted?
[165:49.13]The wound is getting worse.
[165:49.85]Doesn't it have a little bar that goes up when it's splinted?
[165:58.30]Jesus Christ.
[166:01.60]Just heal.
[166:04.24]Kandroth is okay now.
[166:08.62]Can I do that to you?
[166:10.22]Splint injuries.
[166:14.06]Let's actually, get me to a safe place before any more of this shit is going on.
[166:17.78]Pick up.
[166:19.10]Get over here.
[166:21.56]This is just a bad place to be standing.
[166:27.88]Uh oh, just medic.
[166:29.74]Just press this button and that's it.
[166:33.60]Heal her arm.
[166:34.82]I'm trying, I don't understand.
[166:36.50]What do you mean?
[166:41.73]I can't... When I do first aid, she just stands there.
[166:44.91]First aid.
[166:48.70]It's... Where is the first aid happening right now?
[167:12.01]Because you're in the negatives.
[167:13.83]And now I'm fucked.
[167:14.57]So I have to move again.
[167:15.93]I quick-saved it before all this happened.
[167:19.07]I mean, these guys are all terrible.
[167:22.11]But are they terrible enough?
[167:23.93]No, I'm gonna get destroyed here.
[167:28.26]I mean, we can see how this plays out.
[167:39.88]Oh no, I'm getting my ass kicked.
[167:42.25]This is too many of them.
[167:44.65]Nah, that's not gonna happen.
[167:49.82]Alright, first of all, you gotta put him down.
[168:10.73]How's everybody?
[168:11.37]The arm is gone.
[168:13.29]The arm is gone.
[168:14.43]Arm gone.
[168:22.67]What?
[168:24.01]Wait, wait.
[168:25.38]What?
[168:26.06]Hold on.
[168:26.52]Mm-mm.
[168:39.81]Alright, I need to get this straight, because this is like very confusing.
[168:45.83]You have to have a medpack, you have to have a splint kit to splint your arm, and it'll just do it automatically if you press like the medic button down here.
[168:55.32]Like, there's so many different moving pieces here.
[168:59.06]So just click the medic button, and they'll just do it.
[169:05.11]You don't need to, it's just a medkit.
[169:06.69]It's only visible if it's not negative.
[169:11.91]Medic has it heal everyone.
[169:16.08]Okay.
[169:18.16]Well, let's just go back there.
[169:23.68]It was in the negative, and that's why it wasn't showing.
[169:25.44]Well, I mean, like, how the hell am I supposed to know that?
[169:32.03]Just use first aid and just wait.
[169:40.68]Uh... What's going on here?
[169:44.55]Alright.
[169:45.61]This is where we left off.
[169:47.45]Before.
[169:48.09]I need to just... I have to get out of this place.
[169:50.95]Because there's just so many different opportunities for people to come over here.
[169:55.10]Nobody's here now, but they will be.
[169:57.88]So we need to go back to where we were.
[169:59.96]Select everybody.
[170:00.70]No more sneaking.
[170:03.76]Get the fuck over here.
[170:08.85]You.
[170:10.39]Trade.
[170:11.75]Get the first aid off of him.
[170:14.89]You want it in here.
[170:19.62]Give one to Barnabas as well.
[170:27.21]Okay.
[170:28.07]Now I'm just going to press the medic button.
[170:35.50]Because that'll just heal everybody in the squad, or it'll just happen.
[170:38.60]Is that correct?
[170:39.65]Right?
[170:40.21]It is, right?
[170:43.17]So just medic.
[170:48.37]Medic.
[170:52.23]But no, first heal myself, because my arm.
[170:55.67]So, heal, first aid.
[170:58.53]Let's go.
[171:01.44]You're on just medic job, right?
[171:05.24]You're up here.
[171:05.94]Wait, where are you?
[171:08.78]Yeah, okay.
[171:14.45]Nobody coming.
[171:17.75]Alright, heal.
[171:20.03]Get that arm healed.
[171:24.23]Okay, that's what the problem was.
[171:26.17]It was so... It was apparently so negative that I couldn't even see it.
[171:30.61]That's why I was panicking.
[171:39.42]I could get a robot arm.
[171:40.86]I could, you're right.
[171:44.47]Alright.
[171:46.25]Just check.
[171:46.89]Make sure there's no bandits or people running over here to come get me.
[171:51.21]They're not, so this should be fine.
[171:58.03]Alright.
[171:58.65]Now.
[172:02.25]Medic.
[172:04.72]How you doing over here?
[172:08.31]Good.
[172:09.81]Grand.
[172:10.39]Wonderful.
[172:15.39]Minus 10,000, it's too negative.
[172:24.56]Almost time to get out of here.
[172:32.20]Good.
[172:32.50]Good.
[172:33.76]Come on, come on.
[172:39.55]Okay, why would you say that?
[172:41.69]I thought he was a bad guy.
[172:46.42]Frog Musk is now in a recovery coma.
[172:49.06]How about yourself?
[172:49.96]How about the dog?
[172:50.70]The dog needs healing too.
[172:52.74]Heal dog.
[172:57.34]Holy shit, who are these people?
[173:01.82]Oh, it's just a bunch of goats, thank god.
[173:14.64]Let's get out of here.
[173:16.16]Alright, out.
[173:18.52]Pick up you.
[173:21.04]You pick up Roth.
[173:25.69]You pick up Frog.
[173:31.43]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[173:32.71]I can't... Shit.
[173:40.68]How the hell am I going to transport anybody?
[173:44.71]You have to pick him up.
[173:51.87]We gotta get off the road.
[173:52.93]We gotta get out of here.
[173:54.70]Someplace safe.
[173:56.08]I need like a shelter or something.
[174:14.97]I know, I'm going to splint, but I just got to get off the road.
[174:17.57]I know it didn't matter last time, but just so far away here.
[174:21.98]Okay, splint.
[174:25.22]I need you to splint.
[174:32.98]Okay, I've splinted.
[174:33.94]That does not look like it's splinted.
[174:38.45]It is, though.
[174:45.21]Hydrate.
[174:48.77]It's too negative for Splint to work.
[174:55.15]Okay.
[174:56.11]Can you pick up?
[174:57.87]I can't carry with this arm.
[174:59.01]The dog can't do it either.
[175:02.65]When are you going to get up?
[175:08.73]Can you carry two people?
[175:12.41]No, you can't carry two people, can you?
[175:27.54]We have to move.
[175:29.66]Sorry, Frogmust.
[175:30.36]We'll come back for you.
[175:31.40]He'll be safe.
[175:37.28]He'll be safe, right?
[175:46.18]Don't go back to the hub.
[175:47.08]Wait, why not?
[175:47.83]That's like the safest place.
[175:52.15]Hold on.
[175:52.55]Food?
[175:52.87]I don't think he has any food on him.
[176:02.53]He was pretty empty, wasn't he?
[176:03.41]I mean, he has items, but... Should I take the items off of him?
[176:12.07]That sounds like a bad idea.
[176:16.36]He has plenty... His food is okay.
[176:18.02]He's at 272.
[176:18.98]He'll be alright.
[176:26.75]Yeah, he's fine.
[176:28.92]Yeah, he doesn't have any food on him or anything.
[176:31.12]So, there's no reason to really... I can't really do much to him.
[176:34.25]He'll be alright over here.
[176:36.63]He'll be fine.
[176:39.09]I need to go rest up at the hub.
[176:42.01]Let's go.
[176:44.41]First of all, let me quicksave this.
[176:47.83]We're gonna move pretty slowly because I have to carry.
[176:50.57]I should really move together, just in case something bad happens.
[176:57.28]Oh, this sucks.
[176:59.38]This is so bad.
[177:00.34]They have to move so slow.
[177:01.61]I can't leave him behind.
[177:04.59]And your arm doesn't work.
[177:20.72]You got nothing on you.
[177:22.20]It's worth taking.
[177:29.20]Go to the way station.
[177:33.30]Yeah, but I mean, I don't know what's here.
[177:37.14]This is, I paid 10 grand to be able to come back here and use this place.
[177:42.84]I'm just going to walk in here and be like, hey, hi guys.
[177:51.84]It's neutral.
[177:52.50]No, I mean, I got beds here.
[177:54.08]I'm going back here.
[177:56.09]Even if the way station is safe, I got beds and I got food and shit that's there.
[178:02.34]And it's... They're both... I would say they're pretty much... This is like maybe a small... The distance is not a big deal.
[178:12.54]The guild is in other cities.
[178:15.74]Yeah, that's not a guarantee for me right now.
[178:18.29]They're in every town.
[178:19.29]Yeah, but... I mean...
[178:22.59]I mean, am- am I just getting, like, spoiled, back-seated here?
[178:26.73]Should I just go down to WayStation?
[178:28.30]Just because that's where I need to go?
[178:29.54]What do you want me to say?
[178:32.98]I wouldn't know that.
[178:33.76]You all just told me.
[178:37.10]Like, you- what?
[178:41.46]I'm just- I'm going to the hub.
[178:42.82]No.
[178:43.45]Hub.
[178:44.07]That's where we're going.
[178:48.69]Don't eat the raspberries.
[178:55.32]It's right here speed it up Here comes a meltdown no, it's not a meltdown is but like I I don't like know what this is So if I had stumbled across this place, and I'm like no that's not safe, but if you know it's safe You know what I mean?
[179:21.47]I don't know it's there
[179:30.67]It's a trading place.
[179:31.49]Well, that's great.
[179:33.59]I'm sure I'll see it again.
[179:35.29]Real soon.
[179:38.05]Let's go.
[179:45.25]I'm like right there anyways.
[179:46.43]It's not a big deal.
[179:58.07]Yeah, and why would I trust chat anyways?
[180:02.34]I can count on 25 fingers and toes.
[180:05.28]The amount of times that people have told me to do something.
[180:08.74]And it turns out to be the thing I absolutely should not have done.
[180:21.02]How am I supposed to know what's real?
[180:22.06]Alright, frogmuff's just got up.
[180:25.56]And... can you walk?
[180:45.31]They're not coming over to me, right?
[180:47.91]I had nothing to do with this.
[180:57.13]Jesus Christ.
[181:02.72]Alright, let's meet up.
[181:14.20]You guys can walk, he'll make it, and we'll go.
[181:18.26]Turn on Yakety Sax.
[181:19.62]Actually, I'm just going to wait for him.
[181:26.33]That's the right thing to do.
[181:29.45]He's right here.
[181:30.07]He's like full sprinting, so he's fine.
[181:34.61]Actually, it's... No, no, no.
[181:36.37]Just get there safe.
[181:37.89]All of you.
[181:45.15]Goat.
[181:46.55]The goats just saved my life.
[181:47.87]They probably did.
[181:49.71]They probably did.
[181:53.73]Now it's the right thing to do?
[181:54.99]Well, if he can move, then yeah, it's the right thing to do.
[182:01.50]He made it.
[182:02.40]Good job, Frogmusk.
[182:03.50]Good work.
[182:14.30]Uh...
[182:17.91]Alright, we're there.
[182:22.55]Go in there, dude.
[182:23.13]What are you doing?
[182:27.79]Hello?
[182:32.48]That's because it's lagging away.
[182:33.66]It's going to crash the game.
[182:34.98]It's loading the town.
[182:44.24]There we go.
[182:47.02]On your way in.
[182:50.59]How do I like the game?
[182:51.31]I found it hard to get into.
[182:52.53]What start did I use?
[182:53.43]I did the Dog Wanderer.
[182:57.25]The game is incredibly hard to get into.
[183:00.34]It asks a lot of the player.
[183:03.86]Because you just start out at zero, and you're terrible, and everything's terrible.
[183:08.74]But I think that it's a lot of fun.
[183:10.90]I think that it's a lot... This is a great game here.
[183:13.58]If you have the patience for it.
[183:15.80]So, I think it's good.
[183:17.06]I did do the... Yeah, I did start with Slave.
[183:18.68]That's right.
[183:19.79]But I didn't finish Onslaught.
[183:24.54]If you're into hardcore RPGs, it's great.
[183:26.42]And that's the thing.
[183:27.50]I'm not really at all.
[183:30.30]I'm actually really not into hardcore... Super... Hard... Death... Patience kind of RPG games.
[183:37.34]But this one's just doing it for me.
[183:39.25]For some reason.
[183:40.59]So, I don't know what that means, but... It's fun.
[183:44.57]So.
[183:46.25]Uh, you're safe?
[183:48.81]Uh-oh.
[183:52.75]Save it.
[183:52.97]I'll save it when I get in the town.
[183:54.27]Because I have an autosave that just happened a few minutes ago, so... It's because it's goofy.
[184:02.72]It is kind of goofy, but... It's in a charming kind of way.
[184:06.38]What is this?
[184:07.64]Copper.
[184:08.64]Don't want it.
[184:14.89]And from here, I'm going to go... I want to go the way that I wanted to go in the first place, which is kind of like down here.
[184:24.28]So we'll see.
[184:27.88]Have I ever played End of the Gungeon?
[184:28.93]I have.
[184:30.29]I streamed it once.
[184:31.95]I didn't really play it that much afterwards.
[184:43.18]Probably the Freeform Sandbox is better for your playstyle.
[184:48.02]Yeah, because you kind of just get to do whatever you want.
[184:50.23]You just kind of get to do whatever the hell you want.
[184:52.75]And that could be anything.
[184:53.87]That could be whatever the hell you want.
[184:56.89]You want to eat food and just sit by a fire and tell ghost stories?
[185:00.20]Go for it.
[185:01.46]You want to go get your ass kicked by a group of bandits?
[185:03.58]Sure.
[185:05.28]Nobody tells you what direction to go.
[185:09.34]But you better go to the way station now.
[185:35.94]Is that how you think we sound?
[185:38.00]No, I was making a funny comedy joke.
[185:41.63]Actually, it's been a while.
[185:42.63]I should probably take a second to get a drink.
[185:47.51]Fill up my cup.
[185:52.89]Play Mountain Blade?
[185:53.74]Okay, is Mountain Blade... Would I like Mountain Blade if I liked this game?
[185:58.68]I know a lot of people have wanted me to play that for a long time.
[186:01.14]Would I have fun in Mountain Blade?
[186:07.14]It's not really the same.
[186:08.40]Yes, but yes.
[186:09.24]Maybe I'll try it one day.
[186:11.22]But I can tell my voice is getting a little... So, I'll be right back.
[186:15.35]Don't go... Oh, it didn't even turn on my webcam.
[186:23.29]That didn't work either.
[186:29.07]Okay, see you in a second.
[189:39.02]Alright.
[189:41.98]What's the noise?
[189:43.80]I've got the Fallout soundtrack.
[189:49.28]Wait, no, yeah, this is New Vegas.
[189:55.39]Oh shit, my house is on fire.
[190:04.79]Ah, crack it up with a cold one.
[190:09.36]Alright, where were we?
[190:16.87]Oh, there I am.
[190:17.35]Alright, we've made it.
[190:22.19]We've made it to the town.
[190:26.77]I got a Coke.
[190:29.04]They're just easy.
[190:29.62]This is not an endorsement.
[190:41.32]Alright.
[190:44.09]Everybody is normal.
[190:45.21]Hungry.
[190:45.59]I need food.
[190:46.89]I didn't... Did I get anything to sell?
[190:49.21]Let me take a look at the toughness and shit.
[190:51.23]So... 5 toughness.
[190:54.37]That's good.
[190:57.19]Everybody kind of got hit.
[190:59.07]12 toughness.
[191:01.21]6, 4, 5... At least they're not at 0 or 1 anymore.
[191:08.55]Coke?
[191:08.95]They're easy.
[191:09.57]Yeah, they are.
[191:10.63]They're pretty easy.
[191:15.31]So let's go sleep in the beds that I have up here.
[191:21.60]Everybody move.
[191:24.60]What a Pepsi shill.
[191:25.70]I actually don't like Pepsi.
[191:27.30]I think Pepsi's like... I'd rather have a Coke than a Pepsi.
[191:31.37]But I'm not one of those people that will refuse a Pepsi.
[191:36.09]They're pretty much the same damn thing.
[191:40.60]So I gotta go all the way up, huh?
[191:45.04]Everybody go rest.
[191:50.18]The thing is the dog can't rest up there, can he?
[191:54.14]Unfortunately.
[191:57.76]That's a very controversial statement.
[192:01.12]I don't think so.
[192:01.78]I don't think it's that controversial.
[192:05.72]Alright.
[192:06.82]Frog musk.
[192:08.22]Get in bed.
[192:11.35]Everybody get in bed.
[192:12.13]Am I still carrying canned Roth?
[192:15.23]Yeah, I am.
[192:30.26]Dog can rest.
[192:35.00]Is dog allowed somewhere else?
[192:36.51]Because dog can't go in this building.
[192:40.42]Where can I put the dog to sleep?
[192:46.97]Just carry the dog in.
[192:50.39]Oh, whoever's last standing here.
[192:52.13]Alright, madam, you go to bed over here.
[192:56.30]Put down... Oh, what's his face?
[193:00.70]Can Roth get in that bed?
[193:03.62]And pick up the dog.
[193:15.83]Come on up.
[193:21.69]Well, the dog is allowed up here.
[193:22.91]Well, look at that.
[193:27.92]Dog not sleeping.
[193:34.08]I guess dog is not sleeping.
[193:37.54]Well, he's pretty much in bed.
[193:41.14]How's everybody doing?
[193:43.87]We just have to rest here for like a full day, probably.
[193:47.76]Pick him up and put him in bed from Carrie.
[193:49.88]Does that actually do anything?
[194:03.13]That's weird.
[194:03.89]Okay.
[194:05.19]Well, they're all sleeping.
[194:07.43]Welcome to the rest of the stream.
[194:15.02]Alright.
[194:16.88]Fast forward.
[194:17.32]I need food.
[194:24.73]Oh man, we're going to be in here for a little while.
[194:30.39]There's some actual regular beds.
[194:31.89]A floor or two down.
[194:36.11]Is this more comfortable?
[194:39.52]Bed versus camp bed.
[194:43.84]I guess so.
[194:49.56]So how many are there?
[194:50.04]Three?
[194:50.24]No, there's enough.
[194:53.62]You get in that one.
[194:54.96]You get in that one.
[194:56.34]You get in that one.
[194:57.10]Okay.
[195:03.69]It's times eight versus times four.
[195:05.55]Is there any more?
[195:10.77]No, it's just those three.
[195:13.69]So, everyone's in bed.
[195:14.71]Uh, you...
[195:19.30]What the fuck is this camera doing?
[195:26.31]Good luck!
[195:31.39]All of our party members are in trouble, so... Just keep them here.
[195:34.84]We'll switch up the beds too.
[195:35.80]Remember when Jerma embarrassed himself singing?
[195:42.92]What a mess.
[195:44.45]That stream didn't even happen.
[195:54.81]What an odd beginning to the stream that was.
[196:03.69]Play Oregon Trail?
[196:04.77]That's kind of what I'm doing.
[196:06.61]Isn't that like a version of sort of what I'm doing right now?
[196:10.02]In a way.
[196:10.36]Alright, almost at full.
[196:19.94]Head.
[196:20.34]We need food.
[196:21.71]Bad.
[196:25.37]Canroth's almost completely fine.
[196:27.27]Dog is completely fine.
[196:29.15]Madam Chatham is... Yeah, Madam Chatham needs to be moved to one of the more comfortable beds.
[196:37.04]Just wait till you're all at 100.
[196:40.62]And there we go.
[196:45.47]So, let's just go down now.
[196:48.77]Swap beds, please, with really anybody.
[196:51.67]Just get up.
[196:52.37]You get in this one.
[196:55.64]Alright, we've lived to tell another tale.
[196:59.94]14 plus 12, 16 plus 8, 10 plus 8, 8 plus 4, and... 13, but hungry.
[197:15.79]That's 8.
[197:22.71]That almost just all fell out of my mouth.
[197:25.34]I don't know why.
[197:25.78]I like went like... And the whole thing just almost came out.
[197:31.88]So... I don't have any money.
[197:33.70]And I have no supplies.
[197:34.56]Except for I have a couple things I could probably sell.
[197:37.81]Not really though.
[197:42.53]Uh... You're gonna be there for a little while.
[197:44.29]So everybody else get up.
[197:48.81]The three of you... Need to go mine.
[197:53.14]Yeah.
[197:54.98]Yeah.
[197:56.81]I need some miners.
[198:01.90]Can you not get out of bed?
[198:05.58]Dog can't get out of bed.
[198:06.50]Everybody out.
[198:23.33]Why are you sneaking?
[198:28.76]So, get off a sneak, put the dog down now.
[198:36.10]And, who's sneaking?
[198:37.90]Oh, dog.
[198:39.96]Alright, mine.
[198:40.80]I need some ore.
[198:41.70]I need, I could do iron too.
[198:50.23]Copper, this is iron, right?
[198:54.33]Yeah, where's the copper?
[198:55.75]It's over here somewhere.
[199:05.24]On the side.
[199:12.32]Small copper, small... There's two small coppers, but... Weren't there a bigger one?
[199:19.32]I swear there was a bigger... Maybe... Is it gone?
[199:21.84]Did they despawn after a while?
[199:27.46]Iron... Iron...
[199:35.87]Iron.
[199:48.81]That's iron too.
[199:58.04]I guess there are two over here.
[200:01.04]Only two people can mine these though.
[200:06.67]I could go, oh, what's this?
[200:08.67]It's iron.
[200:12.71]Shit.
[200:14.86]Really?
[200:15.12]Hmm.
[200:19.70]I guess we're gonna go one, two, and then how many people can fit on this one?
[200:23.03]Three.
[200:24.29]So we're gonna have, who has the best mining skill right now?
[200:28.03]Use prospect?
[200:39.16]I mean, it's in those two spots that I saw, and then down here.
[200:46.15]Oh, yeah.
[200:48.09]Copper, iron.
[200:49.79]This one's a lot farther away, though, isn't it?
[200:53.41]Not really.
[200:53.77]Alright, who's got the good prospecting?
[200:56.95]Everybody can just get it.
[200:57.75]So we got one, two, three, four.
[201:00.43]That'll work out.
[201:02.55]Who has the best skill?
[201:04.89]That's the question.
[201:09.69]Got Laboring 5, Laboring 18, Laboring 28.
[201:13.38]Go ahead and go over there.
[201:17.92]Laboring 52, you go ahead and get over there.
[201:22.08]The two strongest should be on the one that both of them can go, right?
[201:25.62]Because then they'll just power through it.
[201:34.83]And then you other two...
[201:38.94]They were this way.
[201:40.44]One here.
[201:42.14]Yeah.
[201:42.62]Right here.
[201:44.64]And then... Your arm is almost better, so you can do it.
[201:49.86]We're just gonna have Copper going.
[201:51.89]And the dog can run in a circle.
[201:56.63]Need to nuke the chat?
[201:59.31]No.
[202:01.45]Alright, you're good.
[202:02.65]Get up.

[202:07.02]How's everybody doing?
[202:07.68]We good?
[202:08.58]Making your way over there?
[202:11.38]Start the mining.
[202:12.32]Good.
[202:15.58]They're already doing it over there.
[202:19.68]Out you go.
[202:22.50]Time to make some money.
[202:27.75]Chat is awfully quiet for Kenshi.
[202:29.61]No backseating?
[202:33.93]I had a reprimand moment.
[202:37.25]I said, excuse me!
[202:39.47]Excuse me!
[202:40.23]And everybody went... That face that... Go to the waystation now!
[203:07.38]Alright, what do we got?
[203:10.65]How long is it gonna take you to get one?
[203:12.21]Long time.
[203:12.97]Well, uh, it is kind of a joke, but it's not.
[203:22.87]Welcome, uh... Welcome to the next few little bit of the stream.

[204:17.22]They're like bringing Nightwing into mainstream now.
[204:22.68]A Boomer comic.

[204:27.08]Boomer comic.

[205:35.72]You guys can stay here all day for all I care.
[205:44.95]Especially because I can stack.
[205:46.91]At least Kandroth is going to stay.
[205:50.09]I still haven't turned up the music.
[205:52.43]What the... What the... What the...

[206:44.67]How about something simple?
[206:59.74]Ironforge.
[207:01.36]No, that'll be annoying after a few minutes.
[207:10.77]No, no, no, no OST.
[207:12.41]I'm going musicless for a little bit.
[207:14.78]It's almost, we're almost done here anyways.
[207:16.00]Is that near me at all?
[207:28.62]Kind of, but it's okay.
[207:35.50]What are you two doing?
[207:39.34]Get to work!
[207:39.92]What are you doing?
[207:54.74]It just paused.
[207:55.40]I apologize.
[208:01.12]Dog is hungry.
[208:02.99]You can get one more.
[208:06.59]Uh... Oh, damn it!
[208:08.93]Just fill it up with five.
[208:12.13]This hat's worth, like, a cent.
[208:14.15]Just, like, I'm fine.
[208:28.43]Can't arrange this any better.
[208:29.37]Are you sure?
[208:31.33]I guess not.
[208:40.50]No, I'll just get up to five.
[208:41.34]I can come back and grab it.
[208:44.34]So you go back to town.
[208:48.14]I'll hang out with Masamune.
[208:51.71]And then you are probably done here.
[208:55.45]Yes, you are.
[208:57.41]Same deal.
[208:57.89]This thing is worth, like, two cents.
[208:59.83]Just get rid of it.
[209:01.82]Take this last one and arrange.
[209:03.36]And now you go back to town, too.
[209:09.40]That leaves just the two of you.
[209:15.03]So.
[209:17.55]Mm-hmm.
[209:21.83]Frog, go back to town.
[209:28.47]Keep working.
[209:29.89]Keep working.
[209:32.15]I'm gonna have him fill his entire bag.
[209:37.07]What is the goal of this game?
[209:38.35]There is none.
[209:39.83]The goal of the game is to do whatever you want.
[209:42.03]Whatever you want.
[209:43.95]You can buy up stuff, make money, build a town, have a shit- What's wrong with Massimo?
[209:49.63]Oh, hungry.
[209:51.14]You could just go fight, steal, attack, kill, kind of whatever you want.
[209:56.08]And I just itched my head.
[209:58.80]And there was like something in my hair.
[210:03.61]I don't know if it's a bug or not, but I might have a scream panic moment right now because there's a bug in my fucking hair.
[210:10.15]That was weird.
[210:11.71]That was a weird feeling.
[210:14.39]It's not lice.
[210:15.43]I wash my hair all the time.
[210:18.43]At least twice a year.
[210:20.38]So, it's not that.
[210:27.88]Sell.
[210:29.24]Who is this?
[210:30.40]I don't want to sell to this person, do I?
[210:32.86]Because, doesn't this person have a 50% discount?
[210:42.81]Yeah, I know.
[210:43.53]Sell it to the bartender.
[210:45.29]Don't sell it to this guy.
[210:49.42]Where's that fucking bar?
[210:52.68]Over here.
[210:55.84]How can you only wash twice a year with all the product?
[210:59.63]And... What the fuck happened over there?
[211:06.28]Alright, you, back.

[211:27.03]My, you guys are all going the weirdest possible way.
[211:30.97]Why would you run all this way?
[211:33.43]Where the hell are you going?
[211:36.27]Can't just walk across the town like a normal person?
[211:42.11]Bar thug.

[214:12.78]And it's... Let's take that off and just go trade with you.
[214:15.72]Not you.
[214:16.40]You.

[214:40.37]Let's see.
[214:43.27]Oh, they're pants.
[214:44.03]Okay, I thought it was like a armor.
[214:46.02]What is it?
[214:46.50]Oh, they're way better.
[214:50.60]I thought they were pants.
[214:52.46]I mean, I thought they were... It was like a... Something to go on my chest.
[214:57.56]I don't know why I thought that.
[214:59.84]This, on the other hand, can just go back to where it was.
[215:04.00]That's pretty damn good.
[215:10.89]Keep that metal plate on.
[215:13.63]Keep this one on.
[215:14.45]34, that's... Eat the deer.
[215:19.67]We're in a Jupiter storm?
[215:23.96]We'll be fine.
[215:26.30]Somebody just subscribed!
[215:28.18]And I have no idea who the heck it is!
[215:33.58]But thanks.
[215:36.04]Boots, boots, what about this?
[215:37.97]Looking for martial arts, because that's really good now.
[215:41.50]Barnabus is fucking fantastic now.
[215:43.12]Alright, let's go back to selling.
[215:49.40]Sell those pants.
[215:51.86]I don't know why I thought that just said boomer.
[215:57.40]Alright.
[216:01.18]Everybody is good now, we just need food.
[216:07.35]Health pack, health pack.
[216:08.83]What do you got for food that I can afford?
[216:13.50]It might be time to steal a bunch of food from some random person's house.
[216:26.21]Make mining a job and they will pocket the ore by themselves.
[216:30.61]Interesting.
[216:39.55]Operating machine, copper resource.
[216:41.05]Is that it?
[216:41.67]Is that going to do it?
[216:44.72]I don't need storage for that.
[216:47.67]They won't pocket it unless I have the box.
[216:50.39]Well, it's alright.
[216:53.41]Let's go back here.
[216:59.51]Endless Coca-Cola.
[217:00.61]$4,600.
[217:03.63]I'll have probably about $10,000.
[217:04.56]I need food.
[217:10.08]It's probably worth buying.
[217:11.18]Is it worth buying some of this shit?
[217:12.84]Oh, can I just steal it?
[217:15.54]Bread.
[217:18.22]All you have is the expensive food.
[217:19.95]It's 500 bucks.
[217:22.01]700 bucks.
[217:22.75]287.
[217:22.77]575.
[217:22.91]I need to make food.
[217:43.66]Big money.
[217:47.73]I'm gonna buy one of these.
[217:49.91]No, I can't even do that.
[217:57.13]It's worth it to make storage.
[217:58.21]It will make it so easy to make money.
[218:03.12]That's bad, but I gotta buy another house.
[218:06.86]Right?
[218:07.94]The house that I have already bought is back there, and it's got like a level 1 training dummy.
[218:18.04]What are the houses here?
[218:19.16]Because this is... I mean, the journey is supposed to be taking me.
[218:24.84]I started up here.
[218:27.40]I went up here.
[218:29.26]I got screamed at.
[218:30.82]So I turned around.
[218:32.50]I went down this way, through here, through here, and then down here.
[218:38.20]So I was going to think about trying to go through this section here.
[218:47.27]What's going on?
[218:50.22]Now this is what I call a chat experience.
[218:56.34]And it's pretty good.
[218:57.12]I like it.
[218:58.70]Why did I just say that?
[219:00.03]I do like it.
[219:00.51]Because I do.
[219:01.41]Alright, let me just get this saved.
[219:06.51]I might just have to go hungry down.
[219:12.13]Let me just look.
[219:14.85]Yeah, I might have to go hungry down.
[219:15.93]It's very possible.
[219:22.23]If you get storage, they'll auto-mine, and then you can just have your guy with the backpack go in and out of the world.
[219:26.69]It's sweet.
[219:29.33]Yeah, I think it's probably time just to make somebody a permanent worker.
[219:34.84]And it's probably gonna have to be this person.
[219:38.36]So... Where... I gotta go back to my house.
[219:44.70]My house is back here, right?
[219:47.82]Get a storage unit built.
[219:49.56]Have him just be a permanent miner.
[219:53.36]Cantroth is not, not at all fit to fight.
[219:55.62]No, he's not.
[219:58.64]Get a new house?
[220:01.47]I could do that.
[220:02.99]This is expensive, though.
[220:04.65]What does it take?
[220:06.31]Is there any cheap, cheap houses here?
[220:08.01]This one right here.
[220:08.63]Fifteen hundred.
[220:09.17]Anything cheaper than this?
[220:16.22]Fifteen, fifteen, fifteen hundred.
[220:20.13]Because I could just build the storage thing here.
[220:22.15]There's a lot of mining and resources out here.
[220:24.19]I'm going to buy this.
[220:33.76]But... Should I?
[220:36.78]I can't build in here.
[220:37.92]It might be worth it to get a larger building.
[220:45.86]I don't have any money.
[220:47.38]I guess I could come back with the... Alright, here's the plan.
[220:51.41]His plant.
[220:53.20]I'm going to sell all this, come back, buy a big house here.
[220:57.52]And then I'm going to have him permanently mine copper with the storage unit.
[221:01.68]And just keep money.
[221:06.66]This one is 10,500.
[221:07.12]Or 6,000.
[221:07.36]Or I could get one of these for 4,000.
[221:26.75]What is... Small storage shack.
[221:36.90]I could just get a... Yeah, I could get a cheap house and have it only be for storing materials.
[221:42.88]That sounds like a good idea.
[221:54.35]Alright, 7800.
[221:59.03]Who you vote?
[221:59.69]There's no vote kick.
[222:00.89]Vote kick?
[222:09.97]I'm thinking... This one's 10,000.
[222:12.64]No, it's too... I think I just want to have... For now.
[222:17.68]I'll do... I'll get a small one.
[222:19.86]Build a... I need a research bench in there too.
[222:23.62]Oh, yeah.
[222:25.00]Do I...
[222:27.70]Wait, do I need a research bench in here?
[222:34.90]Storage copper.
[222:37.09]I need one iron plate.
[222:43.49]Don't vote kick me.
[222:44.25]Why are you vote kicking me?
[222:48.62]Yeah, how big does this need to be?
[222:53.02]Is this barely going to fit in here?
[223:05.70]So long, streamer.
[223:06.72]Uh-oh.
[223:09.72]I'm gonna be fucked.
[223:11.78]Yeah, I'm gonna buy this one.
[223:14.92]I'm just gonna do it.
[223:15.66]And then have a couple things here.
[223:17.18]I don't have the means to do this right now.
[223:19.61]I'd rather just kind of get this going.
[223:21.43]So, I'm gonna put a bed and some storage units in here and then have him just permanently mine forever.
[223:29.97]Building purchased.
[223:32.30]Everybody get over here and help!
[223:40.01]Oh, I need three building materials.
[223:42.57]That's easy.
[223:43.03]I can get them.
[223:47.38]Or can I?
[223:49.12]Does the trading... Who sells?
[223:50.54]I need to get building materials.
[223:52.02]Shit.
[223:53.16]Did you have any?
[223:53.78]I need... How many do I need?
[223:58.15]Oh, you do.
[223:58.55]I only have two, though.
[224:00.25]Shit!
[224:03.49]How many did I need?
[224:04.17]I think I needed three.
[224:12.94]I need three building material.
[224:16.86]Damn it.
[224:18.20]That's alright.
[224:25.86]That is two.
[224:30.48]Damn it.
[224:35.87]Well, bring him over here.
[224:36.89]That's adding materials.
[224:44.77]So now I need one more.
[224:45.79]What time is it?
[224:48.07]Uh, everyone just chill for a little bit of time.
[224:54.19]Anything I can do in the meantime?
[224:55.37]Maybe I could have somebody go back and... Yeah, you know what?
[224:58.44]You go mine for now.
[224:59.60]Just go mine.
[225:00.26]Go mine that same dumb vein.
[225:03.84]Because then, after that, eventually I'm going to upgrade it, so...
[225:14.51]Get back there in mine.
[225:23.02]Alright.
[225:24.88]Midnight.
[225:26.82]Sleep.
[225:36.51]What have I done?
[225:37.39]I haven't done anything!
[225:46.62]The fence might have building materials.
[225:48.78]Last time I went there... I think he only had clothes.
[225:56.34]Alright, it's almost midnight.
[226:04.29]Is it exactly at midnight?
[226:05.57]Let's find out.
[226:21.02]Midnight.
[226:22.76]Hey, you got any new stuff?
[226:23.91]You don't?
[226:27.45]Fuck.
[226:30.73]Idling on times ten.
[226:33.05]I kinda have to.
[226:33.97]I don't see anything else over there.
[227:00.93]What did I do?
[227:02.04]What did I do?
[227:02.88]You're under fucking arrest.
[227:07.74]Aram?
[227:10.04]That's the fucking arrest steam train.
[227:15.93]Go to a different place with materials.
[227:17.17]I have to send somebody on an expedition then, so... I'm gonna say...
[227:31.33]Can I get the... will they sell it at the Hive Village?
[227:34.23]They might.
[227:38.65]I guess you could go.
[227:39.37]Just go get them.
[227:41.09]Although be careful because I'm going to save this.
[227:42.71]What if you get like jumped on the way there?
[227:46.21]That's like my hometown.
[227:54.65]What time is it? 8.30.
[227:59.45]When does my new game come in?
[228:06.24]Massive... Oh, fucking goddammit, that's right.
[228:08.64]I gotta give... I have to buy, like, one piece of cheese for the dog.
[228:13.34]Come here.
[228:13.98]Where's Candroth?
[228:14.74]I gotta... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[228:16.02]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[228:19.95]Go back and get this.
[228:24.23]Yeah, I ordered a new game.
[228:35.77]He only notices when we're in mourning.
[228:38.63]That's not true.
[228:45.84]Come over here.
[228:53.52]Now, give me... I have to buy something for the dog.
[228:57.36]I'm gonna buy a... fucking food cube.
[229:00.93]25 nutrition versus 75...
[229:05.24]cooked vegetables.
[229:05.92]Will the dog eat the cooked vegetables?
[229:07.26]I don't think so.
[229:17.95]What about the food cube?
[229:24.99]Because the food cube has a bar.
[229:30.33]Facecam stream?
[229:31.23]I have no idea why this is even on.
[229:32.81]You're right.
[229:36.91]The dog will only eat meat.
[229:41.65]Well, that's not good.
[229:45.87]Call Food Cube.
[229:46.93]He's crying.
[229:55.63]I'm gonna get a Food Cube.
[229:58.11]And then bring it back to the dog.
[230:02.10]Alright, dog.
[230:05.24]Where the hell is dog?
[230:07.55]What is Dog doing all the way over here?
[230:08.69]Alright, are you on an expedition yet?
[230:13.30]You are.
[230:13.58]Hopefully you're not in any trouble.
[230:18.56]Where the hell did you end up?
[230:20.54]Yeah, you're almost there.
[230:22.40]Keep going, good for you!
[230:28.64]Why aren't I stealing food?
[230:29.78]Because it's... ...hard to do where I currently am, because there's really no food to steal.
[230:35.64]There's one building.
[230:38.10]And that one building is a bar, and there's like two pieces of bread, and there's always somebody there looking at you.
[230:43.31]This one, I just... I spent 10 grand to be part of this place.
[230:46.27]I don't want to take from this place.
[230:48.27]So... You know.
[230:57.23]You eating?
[230:57.57]Are you eating this?
[230:59.67]I didn't eat... Did I eat... Did I eat the whole thing before coming over to him?
[231:03.19]Who bought that?
[231:06.57]Who ate... Who ate that?
[231:12.94]Somebody fucking ate that before I brought it to the dog!
[231:19.78]Everybody is so hungry.
[231:21.66]I have this, like, box of food that I'm, like, sneaking around.
[231:24.32]I just got, like, fucking my pockets ripped open.
[231:28.64]Well, it's alright, because Barnabus is almost there.
[231:35.13]And we've been gone for about five hours.
[231:36.37]I'm probably gonna stop.
[231:38.95]And... I'm probably gonna move on to something else.
[231:43.45]In the next, like, 20 minutes.
[231:44.67]I want to get this, like, situated, though.
[231:53.26]We'll transition to something else.
[231:57.16]Alright, here we are.
[232:03.30]Play the original Fallout.
[232:04.40]Now, I can't go from this to that.
[232:06.43]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[232:08.83]Come here.
[232:12.23]Show me your wares.
[232:14.94]Alright, with this meat here... I kind of need to buy a lot of this.
[232:20.10]For the dog.
[232:20.54]So... Just buy it.
[232:24.38]Don't eat it all.
[232:27.71]Bread... No.
[232:29.57]These meat... Meat things?
[232:31.11]No, no, no, no, no.
[232:32.25]I came here for a very specific... I need... Building materials.
[232:38.71]So I need to go to...
[232:43.79]You left your old backpack at the old house.
[232:46.67]I did, didn't I?
[232:47.49]Did I?
[232:48.31]Interesting.
[232:55.71]Which one of these is mine?
[232:59.45]Where the hell is my house?
[233:00.87]Isn't it that one right there?
[233:06.01]Small shack.
[233:06.71]Private.
[233:08.21]Private.
[233:08.47]Which one of these do I own?
[233:17.24]Is it this one?
[233:32.41]Found it.
[233:37.29]Out of bounds.
[233:37.89]Leave it once.
[233:38.51]Get the fuck away from me.
[233:39.73]I'm in my own house now.
[233:41.52]I picked the wrong house.
[233:42.66]I'm not out of bounds.
[233:43.72]I'm in my own house.
[233:45.72]Get out of here.
[233:49.07]Thank you.
[233:52.22]You leave the door open?
[233:53.10]What are you, living in a barn?
[233:55.56]Okay.
[233:57.66]That leaves me with, where's the backpack that was in here?
[234:17.40]They're, like, sneaking into the town.
[234:25.88]They're sneaking into the town.
[234:27.88]Or sneaking out, I'm not sure.
[234:32.25]He's missing a leg.
[234:37.23]I wonder what happens to these two.
[234:50.81]What's this guy gonna do?
[234:56.43]Just watch these guys, they are now your new characters.
[234:58.93]Alright, are they gonna get out?
[235:08.45]Do you think they're gonna make it out?
[235:17.98]Phantom Pain!
[235:23.33]They actually made it out.
[235:31.05]Oh my god.
[235:39.84]Okay.
[235:41.76]You did it.
[235:43.93]Kill them.
[235:44.39]It's free experience.
[236:18.82]I'll take the free experience.
[236:19.94]Let's just watch the bar go up.
[236:29.69]Seven.
[236:32.45]Oh my god, I thought he had all that food.
[236:33.69]I was like, what the fuck?
[236:46.26]Where's my martial arts?
[236:47.12]There it is.
[236:55.47]It's free.
[236:56.11]This is the leader, yeah.
[236:57.75]Take out the leader and that's it.
[236:59.07]You're done.
[237:03.55]Did I just break my leg?
[237:05.80]No.
[237:09.74]Alright, well, that was fine.
[237:12.64]Alright, let's go back in here.
[237:14.14]I need to... Building materials.
[237:18.36]I'm going to assume I've got to get in here.
[237:22.58]What happened to the other backpack that was in here?
[237:24.06]Did somebody steal it?
[237:29.12]Did somebody steal that backpack?
[237:34.74]Alright, we got- we need two.
[237:35.96]I need more than that, though.
[237:38.53]I need at least two.
[237:40.07]Fuck, I can only carry two.
[237:43.07]I'm probably gonna need... Like, iron plates?
[237:53.35]Save the dog.
[237:58.24]Whoops.
[238:04.21]Put a backpack on this guy.
[238:05.29]What happened?
[238:05.71]That's what I'm asking, though.
[238:06.63]Like, what happened to the backpack that I had?
[238:09.30]Did somebody come in my house and take it?
[238:20.39]No, dog!
[238:21.05]Don't come all the way across the world!
[238:22.67]I don't even... I don't... Stay there.
[238:27.29]Just go to the bar.
[238:31.86]I gotta have a guard in my house, so somebody did steal it then.
[238:36.02]Alright, I'll go to the backpack store and buy a backpack.
[238:39.03]A good one.
[238:41.99]Where's backpack store?
[238:48.35]There it is.
[239:08.09]Alright.
[239:09.93]Where is this one?
[239:10.99]This is a wooden backpack.
[239:14.78]That's ones you can stack.
[239:16.70]So how much is it?
[239:17.88]It's only 800.
[239:18.36]So we'll buy it.
[239:22.78]Purchased.
[239:24.14]Medium backpack.
[239:26.24]Now I can buy some more stuff.
[239:29.06]Give food to the dog.
[240:00.35]He's thinking about... He's thinking about letting it... I'm not thinking about that.
[240:12.48]Just buy a fucking little food cube.
[240:15.06]And it's already almost gone.
[240:17.80]God damn it.
[240:19.96]Dog, come over here.
[240:23.89]I can't walk this by anybody else.
[240:34.14]He ate it.
[240:37.72]Okay.
[240:38.16]Dog has eaten the rest of the food cube.
[240:46.62]We're good.
[240:46.84]I'm going to go back to do this.
[240:55.03]I got what I wanted.
[240:55.71]I'm going to go buy a couple more building materials and then I'm going to come back.
[241:00.91]Actually, I'm going to stop there and save it.
[241:04.60]Save the game and get out of this game.
[241:08.84]That's what we're going to do.
[241:15.36]Where's the... Where the fuck is the... Oh, over here.
[241:30.62]No, where is it?
[241:34.01]It's the one with the... And I'm going to give you my final thoughts on Kenshi as we sit here for a moment.
[241:50.88]I think it's great.
[241:52.30]I think it's a lot of fun.
[241:53.18]I need a couple of these.
[241:55.46]I'll get three.
[241:57.38]Just stack them up.
[241:59.00]Because I'm probably going to need more.
[242:00.30]I know I need at least... Yeah, I'm going to need like four.
[242:06.08]But yeah, this is the last Kenshi stream you're going to see.
[242:10.50]On the stream.
[242:15.44]End of Kenshi voice.
[242:20.58]Wait, are people really asking why?
[242:22.28]That can't be happening in the chat right now.
[242:27.38]For real?
[242:34.97]It seems like every time I look over here, there's like a thousand complaints.
[242:47.97]One guy!
[242:49.86]One guy a thousand times!
[243:04.49]Not more labo.
[243:07.09]Oh, shit.
[243:07.71]Okay, no.
[243:08.29]It's not going.
[243:12.63]I like this game.
[243:13.51]I think it's fun.
[243:15.43]But I feel like the downtime that the game is designed to have is not sitting well with a lot of people here.
[243:25.58]So.
[243:27.86]I don't know.
[243:28.84]I feel torn about this.
[243:37.73]All the people that hated it left.
[243:43.76]If I actually listen to chat, then may... But that defeats the whole purpose of the game.
[243:51.12]But isn't the whole point of this game to, like, just do whatever you want?
[243:56.70]You understand?
[243:57.18]That's the point of the whole game.
[244:14.72]Don't listen to chat.
[244:20.75]Just play it all year.
[244:22.99]No, I can't do that.
[244:32.21]Don't listen to them.
[244:34.80]Well... I mean, it's kind of hard not to listen when a bunch of people are talking about how they don't want this to be on the screen.
[244:45.06]You know what I mean?
[244:45.52]It's one thing to be like, oh, forget about chat.
[244:47.20]Who cares?
[244:48.50]But what if it's a shitload of you?
[244:50.60]I mean, if it's like three people.
[244:54.13]And, you know, at some point it's like, what am I doing here?
[245:07.62]It was three guys.
[245:12.18]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[245:17.21]Do a poll?
[245:17.91]You've played like four games this whole year?
[245:31.97]What?
[245:33.01]It's January 8th!
[245:35.52]There's only been eight days this year!
[245:37.56]There's only been eight days!
[245:49.58]Alright, here's what I'm doing.
[245:51.80]This is what we're gonna do.
[245:56.47]I'm the only one that doesn't want me to play this?
[246:02.69]Do I have a different chat?
[246:08.65]Alright, here we go.
[246:09.55]Here's your poll.
[246:14.66]Let me save the game so I don't crash it though.
[246:18.59]I'm going to name this... Okay, that's what I'm going to name this.
[246:28.24]So, here's your poll.
[246:55.78]Let's find out for real.
[247:18.49]There you go.
[247:19.25]34 guys.
[247:23.85]Oh, Kenshi wins!
[247:43.55]What's the something else?
[247:45.93]Naked!
[247:46.53]I'm gonna get naked!
[247:55.08]Only like three people voted for it.
[248:00.37]That didn't like change it at all.
[248:04.19]You should have waited till I told you when the next thing was possible.
[248:17.45]Alright, I'm gonna keep playing, but just hear me out, hear me out, alright?
[248:20.79]Hear me out.
[248:25.77]We're having, like, we're just hanging out.
[248:27.69]We're just chilling.
[248:30.65]But, like, when I look over here, and I just see everybody so angry and annoyed and bored, that's not the kind of stream that I want.
[248:38.37]I don't want that.
[248:40.58]You know what I mean?
[248:41.26]Like, that's not what I want.
[248:56.50]I'm sorry if you think the game is boring, but... Like, uh... I don't... What am I gonna do?
[249:16.53]SIX MORE HOURS IN KIL... Oh, that was embarrassingly bad hair.
[249:24.52]You can't please everyone.
[249:26.30]I know.
[249:27.14]But that doesn't mean that everyone has to be bored.
[249:30.92]You know, I try to make as many people happy as possible.
[249:34.14]Because I want to have fun streams.
[249:36.84]And if people aren't having fun, then, like, I'm kind of doing my job wrong.
[249:41.46]Right?
[249:41.82]I want it to be fun.
[249:45.06]You know?
[249:50.28]I'm concerned about it.
[249:51.38]I'm concerned about this.
[250:01.13]It's not out of anger.
[250:02.23]It's not out of being annoyed or anything.
[250:04.38]It's just I, you know, I want you guys to have fun.
[250:08.52]I don't want you guys to be like, this sucks.
[250:13.04]You know what I mean?
[250:14.44]That's not my goal.
[250:17.23]So if I look over and I see a bunch of people going like, I hate this.
[250:19.91]It's like, well, I have to think about what I want to do.
[250:29.25]He's a concerned parent.
[250:40.89]Anyways.
[250:43.98]Here's what's going to happen.
[250:45.06]Okay?
[250:46.84]I know I've said that like three times.
[250:51.00]We're going to stay on Kenshi for like another 40 minutes or so.
[250:55.22]I want to get to a position where I can move on out.
[250:57.43]Maybe we'll go on one other expedition and we're going to stop.
[251:00.15]I'm then going to transition from that
[251:09.30]I'm going to play Book of Demons.
[251:11.46]Or GeoGuessr.
[251:13.06]For like a couple hours.
[251:17.97]That's a pretty nice businessman voice you got there.
[251:27.87]Alright, so.
[251:28.61]Here we go.
[251:32.30]The last thing I was doing...
[251:40.63]Here's the last thing I was doing.
[251:45.52]Let's see.
[251:48.38]Uh, I had it saved, right?
[251:53.40]What are you guys... Okay, you gotta bring the materials back.
[251:57.84]So you go back where you were over here, sir.
[252:01.06]To the hub.
[252:03.61]You got the materials, right?
[252:04.95]Yeah?
[252:05.95]Yeah.
[252:06.57]I got some food.
[252:07.45]Let's go.
[252:09.83]Let's move.
[252:16.50]In the Lego Island waiting room.
[252:23.04]I couldn't even get that fucking game to run.
[252:28.02]So that leaves the three of you here.
[252:29.52]And I'm gonna wait till you get back.
[252:37.87]Dog's been fed.
[252:38.57]Kind of just need to wait till you get back.
[252:44.10]And then get some food.
[252:45.36]The three.
[252:45.78]I'm going to leave Canned Roth here.
[252:58.01]Where do I want to go?
[252:59.23]Come on, let go.
[253:05.88]Make sure... I hope I save this right here.
[253:07.72]Just in case he gets fucking...
[253:14.02]I knew it.
[253:15.62]Is this a wanderer?
[253:16.74]Bad guy?
[253:17.26]Good guy?
[253:19.72]Tech hunter.
[253:22.22]Does that mean... Are you a person hunter?
[253:25.16]No.
[253:25.32]Alright, thank god.
[253:27.37]We're good.
[253:28.93]Yes, we're good.
[253:35.91]Tech hunters are good guys.
[253:36.81]That's good to know.
[253:39.21]So in the meantime, you just go back to what you were doing.
[253:42.05]You were mining over here, right?
[253:44.99]At the copper vein.
[253:49.26]Which is over here.
[253:53.20]Right?
[253:55.52]Iron.
[253:55.82]Where is copper?
[254:01.69]Where the hell is it?
[254:03.75]It's right there.
[254:06.18]Oh, that's like a tiny little... That's a tiny one.
[254:10.28]Is that the one I was just on?
[254:12.03]Have I almost depleted this thing?
[254:13.45]Alright, where are you at?
[254:23.14]Almost there, come on.
[254:24.46]Hurry, hurry, hurry!
[254:30.93]Dog status, alive.
[254:32.99]It's good.
[254:34.31]I almost just fucking poured this on myself.
[254:36.47]My lord.
[254:42.62]I just almost drank out the other side.
[254:44.08]Alright, build.
[254:56.16]Add the materials, let's go.
[255:00.73]Pour it down your shirt.
[255:07.22]God damn it.
[255:07.70]Alright.
[255:08.10]Hurry up and build this so I can get some more food.
[255:14.20]All of you, work together on it, please.
[255:19.83]Almost done. Almost done. Almost done. Almost-
[255:21.37]Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done.
[255:24.89]Small Shag is built.
[255:26.25]Good.
[255:27.88]You get in there.
[255:29.78]And who's the techie here?
[255:31.28]Oh yeah, Musk is, right?
[255:33.60]Musk, get in there.
[255:34.46]Where are you?
[255:36.92]What the hell are you... What are you doing over here?
[255:53.27]What?
[255:53.55]What is he doing over here?
[255:56.93]Didn't I send Barnabas here?
[256:01.13]He just... Did he even... Is he on follow?
[256:03.81]Did I accidentally click?
[256:06.92]I think I accidentally clicked.
[256:11.42]On the hub... Whatever.
[256:15.80]Oh my god.
[256:16.60]Okay, well... I don't... I accidentally did that, apparently.
[256:22.64]So let's see if anybody else can build anything.
[256:27.09]Storage.
[256:30.43]Copper.
[256:33.24]Looks pretty good.
[256:35.72]Now... How do I tilt this again?
[256:43.66]How do I... Is it like this?
[256:45.36]Yeah.
[256:46.44]This is so big.
[256:47.52]This is all that can fit in this whole house.
[256:54.72]Alright, what do I need?
[256:56.76]I need one iron plate.
[256:59.34]Do a bigger face cam.
[257:02.43]Uh...
[257:03.28]Hold on, give me a sec.
[257:13.17]So now, you're telling me that I can do mine, sell, mine, sell, right?
[257:24.48]This is lagging.
[257:26.94]I just put a dumpster in my house, that's all I did.
[257:32.57]How much can this hold?
[257:48.00]A hundred.
[257:48.96]Okay, that's... Alright.
[257:52.25]So now, inventory auto-haul.
[257:54.89]I'm assuming that's what I need to do.
[257:57.73]So we're gonna put auto-haul as a job, right?
[258:03.43]and then should I have this be hold on where'd he go um where the fuck stop stop stop stop what are you doing right there so how do I get him to mine and bring it back automatically
[258:34.77]If you put someone on a mining job, they'll auto-bring the ore back to the storage.
[258:39.81]So, hold on.
[258:48.28]Come back here.
[258:50.06]So this is use, right?
[258:51.62]Operating machine, copper resource.
[258:53.16]What's he doing?
[258:55.78]Is he just doing it now?
[258:58.72]He's trying to go back now.
[258:59.72]He only has three.
[259:06.24]How often does he do that?
[259:10.98]I tried that, but for me it only mines one ore, and then he goes back.
[259:19.58]So he's only going to pick up one.
[259:20.58]I feel like he's going to wear himself out.
[259:28.27]He's probably going to mine five.
[259:31.81]This is kind of far away, too.
[259:34.99]So he'll mine five at a time.
[259:41.90]How to get him to mine a full... I think he needs food, too.
[259:46.50]He's currently not doing terrible.
[259:48.34]Speaking of food, I need to buy it.
[259:49.86]I need to have it.
[259:52.04]I guess, like, somebody was saying you can lure animals.
[259:56.58]And pull them back to the gate and have them get killed and then pick up their meat.
[260:02.53]That's kind of a tall tale right now, though.
[260:08.53]Well, he's just gonna do that.
[260:10.17]So, keep doing that for as long as you can.
[260:13.65]Speaking of food... Frog Muskie finally made it back.
[260:20.35]This is my favorite stream.
[260:22.79]Let me tell you something.
[260:30.38]I'm happy you're watching.
[260:37.36]I don't want you to be bored.
[260:39.72]Why don't you have a good fucking time?
[260:42.98]So, you know, it is frustrating for me, right?
[260:45.96]As the person that's doing the stream to know that a lot of people aren't.
[260:49.77]So, you know, it's like nothing to do with anybody's personal tastes or anything.
[260:56.31]It's just like, damn, that sucks.
[261:01.74]He's insecure.
[261:02.68]No, I'm not insecure.
[261:03.96]I just, I'm broadcasting to twitch.tv.
[261:10.02]What's the goal here?
[261:11.70]You know, the goal is a community of people that watch and we hang out and we play games and we do fucked up shit sometimes and we have fun.
[261:20.67]That's the goal.
[261:24.01]That's just the goal.
[261:29.40]So I don't want it to be a situation where people are just like, this is not, this is dumb.
[261:35.42]Now I know a lot, a huge amount of you guys didn't say that.
[261:39.51]But a lot of people did, and not a lot, but enough.
[261:43.59]Enough for me to notice.
[261:44.39]And it has nothing to do with the game being bad, it has to do, you know, obviously people don't want to watch somebody like mining for like an hour, and I get it.
[261:53.53]But you know, it's not something that I take lightly.
[261:57.99]You know, that's pretty much it.
[262:06.08]So is he?
[262:08.40]There's three.
[262:08.88]Alright, so he is bringing it back automatically.
[262:13.37]Make your face cam only show your eyes.
[262:14.95]No.
[262:25.77]Alright.
[262:26.64]Uh, dog needs to eat now.
[262:28.96]Otherwise dog is gonna die.
[262:31.54]You are doing your thing over here.
[262:32.74]That's good.
[262:34.30]Make sure you have, like, rooms, shit you do.
[262:36.86]Okay.
[262:38.04]You.
[262:38.64]What the hell are you doing?
[262:39.84]Give that food to that dog.
[262:45.51]No, no, no, no, no.
[262:46.07]Pick that back up because somebody's gonna eat that off the ground.
[262:48.37]That's not the dog.
[262:59.01]Okay.
[263:00.01]Dog, come here.
[263:05.61]Alright.
[263:06.03]Dog's eaten.
[263:12.38]Get some more party members and let's let them stay in town.
[263:16.76]Yeah, I need money.
[263:18.42]I need to, like, add the initial...
[263:21.31]The initial less than six, eight party members is... It's hard to make enough money to have more people and make money to get more people and then send them on jobs.
[263:31.45]It's just a slow process.
[263:36.25]Did he already take it?
[263:40.50]Okay.
[263:42.54]Kandroth is doing that job forever.
[263:46.02]I wonder if somebody else should do it too.
[263:49.84]Because dog... I need food.
[263:51.98]I need to buy... I need to... Okay.
[263:53.80]New area.
[263:54.52]Let's go.
[263:56.12]I'm going down here.
[264:00.20]Or I will go... Maybe I'll go to the way station.
[264:03.90]I have enough money where I can buy food there.
[264:08.05]Dog can come with us.
[264:09.09]He will just be mining until the day he dies.
[264:12.45]Dog is back on the menu.
[264:14.79]No.
[264:15.01]Let's go over here.
[264:21.11]Don't go there to spite Chad.
[264:22.61]Because it's probably a good idea.
[264:25.07]It's probably actually a good idea.
[264:28.89]Y'all need to run together, though.
[264:37.45]Here we go.
[264:40.33]Who's the slowest one here?
[264:45.85]No.
[264:46.93]Nobody's that slow.
[264:49.35]Save it.
[264:57.66]It almost spilled.
[264:58.34]Alright, way station.
[265:02.14]See if I can buy some food.
[265:05.30]Some supplies, maybe.
[265:06.72]Who has shit on them?
[265:08.20]Somebody does, don't they?
[265:13.11]No, he... Operating copper machine.
[265:15.73]Good.
[265:18.51]Excellent.
[265:23.93]Where are you guys going?
[265:27.57]Why did you change course like that?
[265:33.60]That was odd.
[265:45.10]What am I drinking?
[265:45.66]It's just Coke.
[265:47.68]It's just a Coke.
[265:55.47]I thought that was an animal at first.
[265:56.53]It's not.
[265:56.89]What's this bridge?
[266:07.93]Where does that lead to?
[266:08.74]What's this?
[266:11.72]Small copper.
[266:12.80]No, don't do it.
[266:16.16]How close am I to the weigh station?
[266:17.88]Almost halfway there.
[266:18.78]$3,600.
[266:18.86]Good.
[266:35.30]Getting scary.
[266:38.00]Almost there.
[267:05.82]Enable MonkaS.
[267:08.14]Yeah.
[267:16.47]I probably will.
[267:17.89]I'll probably enable all of them.
[267:20.47]Eventually.
[267:20.95]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[267:25.48]Copper... I gotta... Hold on.
[267:27.68]I'm coming up there.
[267:28.48]This facecam's too big.
[267:31.16]There we go.
[267:33.68]That's better.
[267:47.96]Not big enough.
[267:55.38]How are you doing?
[267:58.52]Not terribly.
[268:06.63]Smart maps has been enabled.
[268:10.87]Where are we?
[268:11.67]Alright, way station.
[268:14.33]Who the hell is this?
[268:19.65]Did somebody get left behind?
[268:37.65]Can you walk?
[268:39.77]We're almost there, I promise.
[268:58.46]Got it.
[268:59.32]We're good.
[269:04.01]So where's the way station?
[269:06.15]Up here?
[269:08.23]This is up like a fucking mountain.
[269:23.48]Alright.
[269:23.86]Do I have to do anything weird?
[269:24.84]Is there like a... Who's the group that owns this place?
[269:32.27]Are these... There's a bed, there's supplies.
[269:36.65]What about food?
[269:39.96]Is there a place to buy food?
[269:41.28]I mean, is it a bar?
[269:42.08]There's a bunch of random supplies, huh?
[269:49.06]A new buyer.
[269:49.72]Welcome.
[269:50.12]Hello.
[269:54.36]Let's do business.
[269:57.59]Show me your goods.
[269:58.91]Okay.
[269:59.81]Literally not every single one of you has to come over here.
[270:03.93]You.
[270:04.31]You go.
[270:07.21]You solely just go.
[270:14.63]Cotton... No, you don't have anything, do you?
[270:21.96]Let's go here.
[270:24.62]Uh, I wonder if you have some food.
[270:33.67]Did a big donation come in?
[270:39.09]Oh, soup.
[270:40.85]We had a couple more than $10.
[270:42.11]No soup for you.
[270:43.87]Thanks for the $14.
[270:47.09]Thought about giving $50 for this occasion, but I need money.
[270:52.47]That's more than enough.
[270:53.75]Thank you.
[270:54.83]Jerma, I know you love your fans, but sometimes you have to play the games you love.
[270:57.58]Many of us will stick around for it.
[270:59.34]The ones that leave, that's their own fault.
[271:00.88]Just please, for your own sake,
[271:04.20]uh don't let chat get to you thank you don't worry about giving me fifty dollars but there's two sides to that coin right there's do whatever the fuck I want whenever the fuck I want because I want to do it but the other side of that is remember you know there's a lot of people that pay this stream money
[271:30.63]And at the very end of the day, I do want people to be happy.
[271:38.19]And I do want people to think, ah, this is not fun.
[271:40.95]You know what I mean?
[271:41.42]Because a lot of people pay this free money.
[271:48.06]And I do agree.
[271:49.74]Sometimes I am just going to do whatever I want to do.
[271:55.08]But it's a weird balance that I think is hard to do.
[272:00.58]In my personal opinion.
[272:03.48]Because I do want people to not be bored.
[272:06.72]I want people to have fun.
[272:07.30]You know what I'm saying?
[272:11.33]You know what I mean?
[272:14.13]Do I not like this game?
[272:14.79]No, I love this game.
[272:15.65]I think this game's great.
[272:16.51]Alright, so, with that being said...
[272:23.96]Uh, Dryski also gave $10.
[272:25.54]Uh, funny man, make laugh good, but in all seriousness, love the Kenshi streams, buddy, and love your stream even more than that.
[272:31.76]Keep up the good work, soldier.
[272:34.78]Thanks.
[272:37.53]Thanks.
[272:38.11]Thank you for the $10, and thanks for the message.
[272:43.13]Appreciate that.

[273:39.57]Who the hell is that?
[273:42.65]Looking to hire some bodyguards?
[273:43.83]I need some mercenaries to guard my outpost.
[273:47.64]2,000 per day.
[273:49.90]I can't afford that right now.
[273:51.60]Peace.
[273:55.03]Looking for someone to join together with.
[273:58.41]Maybe.
[273:59.41]But who are you?
[274:00.49]Just a nobody looking for like-minded people to band up with.
[274:05.48]Okay, I'll join you.
[274:06.18]How much?
[274:07.66]3,000 cats.
[274:08.92]So there are two people in here that I can get for 3,000.
[274:12.98]Plastic surgeon.

[274:19.11]Guild pacifier.
[274:21.77]Wren.
[274:22.33]Okay, let's talk to Wren.
[274:29.38]Looking to join.
[274:31.20]Not much to tell.
[274:32.18]The city's getting pretty chaotic these days, so I decided to band up to find myself a new life.
[274:38.54]How much you charging?
[274:41.44]$3,000.
[274:42.76]Why not join for free?
[274:45.26]Of course, don't want you leaving me stranded and butt naked in the sands now, do I?
[274:49.10]Give me some value so I know I'm not just disposable fresh slaver meat.
[274:55.36]Well, this is apparently where you go to hire a million people.
[274:59.88]Here to buy?
[275:00.44]Let's do business.
[275:01.10]What do you got?
[275:01.48]Alright, thank god.
[275:02.10]I got a lot of food.
[275:03.30]That's exactly what I'm looking for.
[275:08.74]Let's get some of these.
[275:09.62]Uh, food cubes are great.
[275:15.61]That's all I can really afford, but I have people I need to eat.
[275:18.73]Can I get another one?
[275:19.45]No, I can't afford another one.
[275:22.17]I do have enough.
[275:27.24]I should be okay now.
[275:28.18]Now we got food.
[275:31.41]At least enough to survive.
[275:32.75]I can put the dog down.
[275:37.54]I might steal some shit from here as well.
[275:43.50]It might be time to, uh, steal.
[275:47.13]If you know what I mean.
[275:49.73]What's in here?
[275:52.27]Wooden bowl, building material, fabrics, gears, fuel, what upstairs?
[275:57.59]What do you got upstairs?
[276:11.33]Nothing.
[276:11.83]Well, it's not entirely true.
[276:14.11]This is a... This is a material bin.
[276:21.89]Storage ore.
[276:24.54]Hold on.
[276:28.32]Got nothing in there, man.
[276:31.44]Not worth it.
[276:38.42]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[276:41.20]Chainmail sheets.
[276:45.48]Average price, $2,500.
[276:46.13]32% chance.
[276:49.69]That's a lot of money.
[276:59.46]The preemptive save skill.
[277:01.06]Yeah, I had to.
[277:04.49]Five community subs from beer, me, a username.
[277:07.41]Thanks again for the community subs, a lot of them tonight.
[277:10.29]You've done it before, you did it earlier.
[277:14.07]Thank you.
[277:16.49]Gotta wait for this to load.
[277:17.58]32% might not be worth doing this over and over again, but maybe it is.
[277:20.00]It's a lot of money.
[277:23.48]I don't know.
[277:24.46]It's probably not.
[277:29.60]It's probably not worth doing.
[277:35.34]Speaking of money, how's shit going over here?
[277:41.79]How are you doing as a person?
[277:43.11]You need some food, don't you?
[277:47.07]Oh, my goodness.
[277:50.49]Storage box.
[277:51.61]We're about to head back.
[277:53.87]How much is in the box?
[277:57.70]Let me just see how much is in there, because I'm going to sell it.
[278:01.58]What do you got?
[278:02.10]Five yet?
[278:03.32]Oh, just pick up.
[278:04.12]Pick up one, two, three, four, five.
[278:06.29]Head back.
[278:07.51]Because I can't even look in there.
[278:10.99]Time to sell the copper.
[278:21.06]Hurry, hurry.
[278:25.34]Seventeen.
[278:27.10]That's pretty good.
[278:31.28]Let's cash it in.
[278:32.42]Why not?
[278:38.55]Oh.
[278:39.13]What's happening here?
[278:43.03]Um... What's going on?
[278:47.95]Okay.
[278:51.09]Sell it.
[278:52.23]And then go back to what you were doing.
[278:54.84]Dog's dead?
[278:55.38]No, dog's eating.
[278:56.66]He's currently eating.
[278:59.54]Now I just gotta go sell this at... What are they doing in here?
[279:05.30]Oh my god, is this free meat?
[279:07.04]This is gonna be free meat.
[279:09.14]Uh, how do I get free meat?
[279:10.32]This is meat.
[279:11.86]They just wandered into the town.
[279:14.52]What a godsend.
[279:18.36]Free meat.
[279:24.22]I can't kill them by myself.
[279:26.48]This is gonna sound the alarms or something, right?
[279:40.75]Help me!
[279:41.11]Help!
[279:41.43]Help!
[279:45.13]Help me!
[279:52.60]Run away.
[279:57.18]Thank you.
[279:59.62]Oh yeah, beautiful.
[280:00.62]Alright, now take the meat while they're fighting.
[280:23.34]That's food for a goddamn whole winter.
[280:27.68]That's food for an entire winter.
[280:30.59]Yes!
[280:31.71]Oh my god, that's so much food!
[280:34.03]And the pelts are worth so much money!
[280:35.33]Alright, I need to heal myself.
[280:42.85]I don't have a med kit.
[280:43.55]What's wrong with my body?
[280:45.89]What's wrong with my arm?
[280:46.89]I'm holding my head.
[280:47.79]Okay.
[280:49.67]I got a lot of stuff to sell and shit.
[280:52.72]Wait.
[280:57.34]Okay, I almost had a panic attack.
[281:02.58]Let's go.
[281:10.75]That was perfect.
[281:11.69]They just waltzed right into the town.
[281:16.07]Oh my god, I couldn't have asked for something better than that.
[281:20.03]Put the camera in the top right corner.
[281:24.30]I will.
[281:24.66]Just give me one second.
[281:26.60]Am I not taking the ore out of the container?
[281:37.04]I thought I did.
[281:37.48]Am I going crazy?
[282:05.24]Am I doing this right?
[282:07.24]Am I doing this wrong?
[282:20.03]Okay.
[282:20.65]That was weird.
[282:22.17]I guess maybe because he was doing the return?
[282:24.31]Alright, I'm going to sell all the pelts.
[282:32.70]I'm gonna cook all the meat, and then I've got an expedition.
[282:40.14]These pelts are worth 200 each.
[282:42.84]Should I save any of these, or should I just get fucking rid of all of them?
[282:50.27]I could turn them into leather, but maybe it's not worth it.
[282:52.83]5,500.
[282:56.71]I've got a bunch of meat that I'm gonna cook.
[283:01.64]In the fire.
[283:03.42]Didn't miss any meat, right?
[283:05.42]That was so lucky.
[283:06.36]I can't believe... I can't fucking believe that happened.
[283:11.55]They just waltzed right in here, and it was just free food.
[283:15.05]For at least a week.
[283:23.65]Was the food not go bad?
[283:24.73]Well, I gotta make sure I cook it.
[283:26.19]I don't know, does it?
[283:26.99]I do need some medkits.
[283:31.27]Let's buy three of them.
[283:35.19]Heal my broken head.
[283:38.63]Because, you know, I need to.
[283:44.59]And then, go back to mining.
[283:45.75]Well, I'll actually cook this shit first.
[283:49.00]Because, does it go bad?
[283:53.12]Uncooked meat from some dead animal, probably.
[283:56.58]Possibly edible.
[283:58.18]Possibly edible.
[284:01.38]Dried meat does not rot.
[284:03.27]That's good to know.
[284:05.25]Did I heal enough?
[284:05.87]I think I did.
[284:11.81]Yeah, apparently I did.
[284:12.53]Alright.
[284:13.53]So now I need to cook this shit in a fire.
[284:16.90]Is it going to burn my house down?
[284:24.76]Alright.
[284:31.36]Am I alright?
[284:31.90]I look tired.
[284:32.50]I don't think so.
[284:39.76]Maybe a little.
[284:43.22]Maybe a little bit.
[284:51.91]Oh, little baby tired boy.
[284:56.97]He'll do this for a little while, so that's fine.
[284:59.63]I'll check back on you in a minute.
[285:01.15]Dog is still eating.
[285:02.09]That's good.
[285:04.41]You're up here.
[285:04.89]You gotta go down.
[285:05.51]I don't want you up there when the knight falls.
[285:10.85]And let's save it.
[285:14.15]Save game.
[285:14.85]Okay.
[285:28.44]So, what the fuck do I want to do now?
[285:35.35]I need to look for some veins that are close by.
[285:38.15]Even if it's iron, it's probably, is it worth, is it even worth collecting iron?
[285:45.71]How much does it sell for?
[285:46.98]If you can't, depends on the zone.
[285:58.87]Yeah.
[285:59.91]The warning?
[286:03.38]Not until you start building a base.
[286:08.84]How much longer will I be streaming for?
[286:12.03]Oh, well, because I decided I was going to just stick with Kenshi.
[286:15.83]It's been about six hours.
[286:18.23]Probably not that much longer.
[286:19.93]Probably maybe like another hour or two, I would say.
[286:23.69]And then I'm going to stream on Thursday.
[286:27.98]I'm going to go Thursday and Friday.
[286:30.66]Because I'll get 700,000 games on Thursday.
[286:33.48]And then... I probably shouldn't say that yet.
[286:43.60]12 hours.
[286:44.34]You should start just doing 12 hour streams every other day.
[286:46.93]I think my health would decline.
[286:51.51]Yeah, the 700,000 games 2 came out.
[286:54.63]And I got it.
[286:55.27]It's gonna be here on Thursday, so that's what we're gonna do on Thursday.
[286:58.76]And then we're gonna go Thursday and Friday.
[287:00.74]So we'll do two days in a row after tomorrow.
[287:06.05]Uh, how's that food doing?
[287:13.98]Oh, shit, I'm eating it.
[287:14.84]Right, okay, well, of course I am.
[287:16.20]It's food.
[287:18.72]Is it gonna automatically put this in here?
[287:24.52]No, I gotta do it manually, I think.
[287:25.90]Maybe I can just do this, right?
[287:28.79]Yeah, that'll help.
[287:34.07]Uh, it'll just keep going.
[287:38.73]I need... What do I need to do?
[287:46.22]Stream 24-7 for a week and then retire.
[287:49.20]I wouldn't be able to even stay up that long.
[287:56.29]Let's go this way.
[288:01.89]People are freaking out.
[288:03.09]For what?
[288:05.07]That guy's sprinting around like a psycho.
[288:08.12]Alright, let's see.
[288:09.54]Personnel check.
[288:10.38]5200.
[288:11.54]Food is over here.
[288:16.59]He's cooking it all.
[288:18.35]Empty backpacks.
[288:19.65]Some food on Barnabas.
[288:22.79]Actually, quite a lot.
[288:25.00]The dog is still eating.
[288:25.94]That's good.
[288:29.86]I'm trying to think of what else.
[288:35.69]I should probably check the other building here.
[288:37.89]So let's do that.
[288:42.38]Because I went in this one.
[288:43.30]Did I go in... At least that's the only two that are here.
[288:50.19]Cool outpost.
[288:53.05]I think I might want to go... I need to go get that food.
[288:58.57]I need that food from the hub, and then they need to go down.
[289:08.44]Because I want to keep him there mining.
[289:10.22]So we kind of have to go back.
[289:14.57]Unless I can find something to fight.
[289:18.25]Great Canadian fuck club.
[289:19.35]Five community subs.
[289:21.56]Thank you.
[289:23.06]More community subs.
[289:24.84]You guys are fucking awesome.
[289:25.74]Thanks.
[289:29.50]Five, five, five, ten.
[289:30.78]That's a lot.
[289:32.68]Thank you guys.
[289:33.38]Seriously.
[289:37.53]Every time he reads the username.
[289:39.07]This is a well...
[289:45.79]Is it time to make my own damn town?
[289:48.13]Not yet, probably.
[289:48.85]I need, like, another couple people.
[289:51.35]Give it a total of 300 subs.
[289:56.03]300 subs?!
[289:58.59]That's... Ah, that's fucking crazy.
[290:03.57]You need more people and more money.
[290:13.35]Making your own town is a grind.
[290:15.55]I could probably imagine.
[290:16.45]But I'm trying to think of where I want to go from here.
[290:19.87]I just have to go back to the hub.
[290:22.59]We got some food.
[290:23.55]We have some resources now.
[290:25.36]Now I'm going to take the troop.
[290:28.64]Deck them out with food.
[290:29.96]Deck them out with resources and shit.
[290:31.80]And we're going to go down.
[290:40.37]These are slavers.
[290:43.23]I don't think my band of idiots can defeat them.
[290:47.43]Although it's minus, is it 12?
[290:50.47]Hold on a minute here.
[290:56.56]This number right here, right?
[290:58.14]12 and then minus 13.
[291:01.10]This number is what it currently is now, right?
[291:04.46]That is with the minus 13 on it already included, right?
[291:13.70]Okay.
[291:16.02]I just need to triple check that.
[291:17.42]So I am not going to go fuck with them.
[291:18.74]I'm going to get my ass kicked.
[291:19.62]There's too many of them.
[291:21.46]Go this way, if you will.
[291:27.85]So you don't cross the path of all these dudes.
[291:36.95]Holy military base.
[291:38.03]I haven't looked at that yet, though.
[291:40.84]You guys are going to get off the road so I can walk on it.
[291:47.49]Alright, how you doing?
[291:48.15]You still cooking food?
[291:52.69]Yes, you are.
[292:01.16]No rum.
[292:02.00]Keep it cooking.
[292:03.18]Good.
[292:08.96]Dog is fine, right?
[292:10.10]Yeah.
[292:15.29]Don't want to get fucked over there.
[292:18.10]Alright, go!
[292:23.58]Just shift-click it and automate it?
[292:27.85]Hold on, what the fuck is this?
[292:31.21]Escaped Servant.
[292:39.39]Two, six, nine...
[292:47.90]Mm-mm.
[292:49.32]Three.
[292:51.00]Why do you all suck so much?
[292:55.18]From what?
[292:55.70]What's happening here?
[292:57.64]Weather penalty.
[293:03.84]That's just fucking weather.
[293:10.38]So, they're not hostile, right?
[293:13.62]State normal.
[293:15.60]No.
[293:16.22]I should be able to walk right by them.
[293:23.38]I'm not going to cause a problem if you guys don't cause a problem with me, I won't cause a problem with you.
[293:29.91]In fact... Yeah, that's fine.
[293:35.33]Recruit?
[293:37.13]I don't have an option to.
[293:40.31]I don't have mods installed right now.
[293:42.53]I'm just going to play the base game for a little while.
[293:56.02]Alright, so the hub.
[293:58.38]There it is.
[294:02.28]I made it home.
[294:05.53]We're here.
[294:07.33]We did it.
[294:10.97]No, we didn't.
[294:11.37]That's the military base.
[294:12.25]Might as well take a look.
[294:12.95]Alright, let's auto-haul this when we get a chance.
[294:25.05]I have so much fucking food.
[294:26.17]Uh, auto haul, right?
[294:31.55]There we go.
[294:36.24]Where's the dog?
[294:39.06]Where's the dog?
[294:41.66]What are you doing back here, dog?
[294:47.02]Let's go.
[294:47.34]Alright, this is all destroyed.
[294:58.15]Why is this place destroyed?
[294:58.99]There's nothing here.
[295:00.25]There's a ninja blade in here.
[295:06.40]Flesh cleaver.
[295:09.52]Mercenary club.
[295:10.34]What is all this stuff?
[295:12.80]How do I get in there?
[295:16.98]Holy shit.
[295:17.64]Are you kidding me?
[295:24.02]Well, that's fucking awesome.
[295:27.37]Oh my god, this is all free stuff.
[295:29.69]This is ridiculous.
[295:34.92]There's nobody... There's nothing here.
[295:41.18]Can I fix this place up?
[295:48.80]Damn.
[295:50.47]Alright, well, get to it then.
[295:53.99]You're the one with the backpack.
[295:56.33]Iron plates.
[295:58.70]Long Cleaver.
[296:02.88]I mean, that's not that great, but still, it's free.
[296:06.04]Ninja Blade.
[296:06.76]Oh, that's outside.
[296:10.22]Alright, hold on.
[296:12.02]Iron Plates.
[296:13.26]Horse Chopper.
[296:16.86]Uh... What about stuff I can open?
[296:21.96]Go check out that Ninja Blade.
[296:31.45]Damage versus humans.
[296:33.65]Attack bonus +2.
[296:36.35]I mean, it's alright.
[296:40.64]Cleaver.
[296:41.06]Let's go look.
[296:43.54]Could just sell them.
[296:44.46]This is not technically stealing.
[296:45.78]It was just on the ground and nobody wants it, right?
[296:52.89]Something like that.
[296:58.05]Any other boxes to open?
[296:59.45]Look at this.
[296:59.89]Are you kidding me?
[297:02.75]Damn.
[297:04.45]How much does it even sell for?
[297:07.97]113?
[297:08.09]I mean, that's not great, but that's not terrible.
[297:12.77]How many of these can I pick up?
[297:16.71]That's a lot.
[297:33.03]Hmm.
[297:35.65]Well, now I know why it's free.
[297:38.15]Because it kind of sucks.
[297:40.59]Mercenary Club.
[297:41.42]People can just load up and... Can't pick that up.
[297:48.10]Uh, Iron Stick.
[297:49.10]Worthless.
[297:53.40]That's not terrible.
[297:59.56]Welcome to the Mercenary Club.
[298:03.47]Never do it for free.
[298:04.93]Ever.
[298:07.87]Unless there's something I'm missing here.
[298:08.87]These aren't really that great.
[298:10.87]I kind of had a... Had a moment there.
[298:13.39]There's no other tools or anything.
[298:16.43]Nothing I can tell.
[298:19.50]These really just kind of suck.
[298:22.68]These sell for... I'm gonna get... 99.
[298:24.34]24. 84...
[298:32.30]387, that's not bad.
[298:33.36]197's not bad.
[298:35.21]Might as well just put this up here.
[298:36.63]Well, I guess that was weird.
[298:43.77]For storage purposes, just hold on to it.
[298:45.66]How many iron sticks can a horse mercenary... No.
[298:53.30]I think I'm gonna leave it all.
[298:55.74]Flesh cleaver, long cleaver.
[299:02.60]93.
[299:02.62]86.
[299:03.86]Eh.
[299:08.47]Well, that's not good.
[299:09.37]I mean, I guess just... I'm going back anyways.
[299:18.97]Just everybody pick something up.
[299:26.13]It's free anyways.
[299:34.76]19 attack.
[299:36.62]Not worth it.
[299:37.36]I'll get my ass kicked.
[299:38.37]Somebody will get hurt and die.
[299:43.19]You full?
[299:43.67]Where the hell are you?
[299:45.45]Get over here, man.
[299:54.20]You can't pick that up.
[299:55.16]Why the hell can't you?
[299:55.86]What do you mean you can't pick that up?
[300:00.64]You're standing right in front of it.
[300:06.89]Too long?
[300:11.05]Too long!
[300:11.77]Alright, everybody has a bunch except for you.
[300:21.40]You need to actually keep that on.
[300:24.88]Get another stick.
[300:27.00]Let's go.
[300:34.00]Everybody has their pockets full.
[300:35.60]We can head back to the hut.
[300:46.87]Make a fat 1.5k.
[300:49.53]Something like that, yeah?
[300:54.16]So let's get together again and...
[301:17.30]Minus three -2 minus five minus five minus four minus six minus five Minus six minus three -2 minus five -2 seven Isn't he better with unarmed?
[301:47.55]Four.
[301:47.93]Yeah, he's better with unarmed.
[302:12.88]Dog's here too with 15.
[302:18.96]I gotta get rid of this stuff I gotta put on the ground for now.
[302:21.20]Where is everybody?
[302:25.94]Get back inside.
[302:26.60]Throw all this shit on the ground for now.
[302:33.82]Because this is a fight here that I have to fucking win.
[302:38.48]Okay.
[302:39.92]Is it ten?
[302:40.44]How about you?
[302:49.28]Doesn't matter.
[302:51.30]You.
[302:52.50]Drop.
[302:52.86]I gotta drop it.
[302:53.62]I have to.
[302:54.30]Otherwise I'm gonna die.
[302:55.07]Doesn't really matter, does it?
[303:05.30]Dog is 15.
[303:05.80]10.
[303:06.04]Oh, they're all so weak.
[303:23.66]They're all doing minus 5.
[303:25.64]I can't get in there and just fucking destroy them.
[303:29.44]Dog is malnourished.
[303:30.43]Not starving.
[303:30.99]We're good.
[303:34.33]18, 8, and 15.
[303:41.21]There's just so many of them.
[303:43.65]Got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[303:48.62]I don't know.
[303:54.22]How much do I have?
[303:54.74]What do I have for heals?
[303:56.39]Not very much.
[303:59.19]What's lowering my attack?
[304:00.49]It's the weather.
[304:02.25]There's like a weather problem here.
[304:04.37]Equipment.
[304:06.83]This.
[304:07.13]It's like, isn't there a weather penalty going on right now?
[304:10.09]Because I don't have any like dust protection.
[304:15.01]Minus nine weather penalty.
[304:18.95]Defense.
[304:19.37]What do they have for defense?
[304:19.99]Defense.
[304:21.91]Six they have much more defense.
[304:23.59]It's probably not a good idea Alright, I'm probably too bad I just threw everything on the fucking ground that's great It doesn't wouldn't that worth that much money anyways I'm gonna save it here and just see what happens if I could fight him.
[304:39.71]I'm just gonna go for it Everybody get together over here
[304:51.17]Just bring him in.
[304:55.39]Bring him inside.
[304:56.19]Okay.
[305:06.34]Jesus, look at this fucking mess.
[305:15.03]Let's go.
[305:29.10]We just got destroyed.
[305:29.92]That's too many.
[305:32.40]I just got my ass kicked.
[305:38.38]That wasn't even a contest.
[305:43.11]This is too many.
[305:43.91]It didn't matter how much attack they had.
[305:46.05]When there's 15 of them.
[305:48.05]We're gonna have to run.
[305:50.83]Because they'll just take everything I have.
[305:57.46]How much food do I have?
[306:00.54]That's the real question.
[306:01.40]The food, actually, the food, oh, that's a lot of food.
[306:04.62]That's, that's, that's... These things are like 600 bucks.
[306:12.95]They're gonna eat the dog and shit.
[306:14.89]Let's try to get away.
[306:33.40]See if I can get out.
[306:38.62]Oh, they might not even- they might not be here.
[306:51.18]Dog turned into a food cube.
[307:07.88]No, they're here.
[307:08.93]Alright.
[307:10.69]I mean, the question is... Can we run?
[307:16.75]Look at how close I am.
[307:18.19]I might be able to just bait them over here.
[307:21.57]If everybody's in a full sprint... Go for it.
[307:27.53]Sneak away.
[307:28.32]It's too late.
[307:30.06]They are running right at her right now, I think.
[307:34.36]Go!
[307:35.53]Okay, apparently no one's running.
[307:36.83]And why is that exactly?
[307:39.84]What happened there?
[307:42.46]I have everybody selected.
[307:49.38]What?
[307:54.23]Okay.
[308:10.71]I'll pick that shit back up then.
[308:29.92]I'll take it.
[308:40.15]Let's go!
[308:42.87]Back to town.
[308:46.69]How come none of you listen when I do that?
[308:59.38]All together now.
[309:00.30]Wait for... Oh, you're over encumbered.
[309:08.47]Ah, yeah, forget it.
[309:09.23]It's not worth that much money.
[309:15.89]Hub.
[309:16.15]And everybody go.
[309:23.45]What's going on?
[309:25.03]We can't run that way?
[309:28.33]So once we get back to this town, I'm probably going to call it for the night.
[309:34.70]I'm getting hungry.
[309:35.66]I need some food.
[309:38.92]I need to go check on some things.
[309:43.38]Bad pat- it probably is bad pathing.
[309:51.23]End it with karaoke.
[309:52.57]Nah, I'm kind of drained at the moment.
[309:56.39]I can't do karaoke six plus hours into a stream.
[309:59.77]Not right now.
[310:02.39]No GeoGuessr- um...
[310:07.95]You know, probably, when I get 700,000 games in the mail, then we're going to... Maybe we'll just warm up with that and then play that on Thursday.
[310:22.92]The way my facial hair sits on my cheeks makes me look malnourished.
[310:25.98]I have to shave anyways.
[310:28.90]Thanks for the reminder.
[310:30.24]I need to do that.
[310:34.72]So, the hub!
[310:36.53]Let's get in here and make sure everyone's safe.
[310:39.37]I'm gonna run into a bunch of fucking monsters right now or something.
[310:47.83]Just watch.
[310:53.10]Now I can't unsee it.
[310:54.42]It's alright, I'm well-fed.
[311:00.28]Don't worry about me.
[311:08.26]We're safe.
[311:10.48]I think.
[311:24.11]Everybody inside.
[311:24.94]Everybody in?
[311:31.86]There's tons of food over here too, right?
[311:34.18]Let me just check.
[311:37.51]Oh, that's a lot of meat.
[311:41.56]Food will be cooking.
[311:42.36]People get to eat.
[311:43.04]That's good.
[311:43.66]Everyone's safe and sound.
[311:49.20]Oh, I'm going to, like, burp.
[311:51.40]But that's going to conclude the stream for tonight.
[311:54.22]We'll do the bits and the subs, too.
[311:55.68]About seven hours.
[312:00.76]It was kind of a wild one tonight.
[312:01.92]We started with some extreme stuff and moved on to a chill stream.
[312:06.98]And now I'm going to get some food.
[312:11.73]Maintaining a beard can be difficult?
[312:13.25]Oh yeah.
[312:14.43]I can't grow a beard.
[312:15.69]Facial hair does not grow here.
[312:18.21]It does not grow here.
[312:21.05]I get like a really sporadic shitty beard here, here, and then like here.
[312:26.75]I don't grow any facial hair here.
[312:29.11]It's strange.
[312:31.37]It's very strange.
[312:33.85]But, thanks for sticking around.
[312:36.00]I'll see you guys not tomorrow.
[312:40.24]I'll give you the tentative plan here.
[312:43.14]So, tomorrow, I have a few obligations.
[312:51.57]Human obligations, right?
[312:54.47]Thursday, 700,000 Games Part 2 comes in, so it's going to be fun.
[313:01.58]Knees never coming back.
[313:03.48]No, I am.
[313:04.10]What's going on here?
[313:05.36]Itchy?
[313:07.12]And then Friday, I'm gonna probably try to plug in the Dreamcast.
[313:10.54]It's been a long goddamn time.
[313:15.27]So, much love to you if you're taking off.
[313:18.27]See you on Thursday.
[313:21.27]Take care of yourselves.
[313:23.71]And I'm gonna disappear from the camera.
[313:25.47]I'll give you a last final wave.
[313:27.87]See ya.
[313:29.59]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[313:32.40]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[313:33.60]Slow down, slow down.
[313:34.26]Where are you going?
[313:34.70]What are you doing?
[313:35.23]Stop it, please.
[313:35.95]And there's the outro.
[313:47.13]There it is.
[313:48.84]I like the game.
[313:49.36]I think it's fun.
[313:51.92]I think it's an interesting experience.
[313:54.02]It just takes a while to get going.
[313:56.26]And that's kind of the way it is.
[314:04.25]With that being said, I'll see you later.
[314:06.59]Let's go back a while ago for the bits.
[314:16.32]Starting back here.
[314:18.78]Hey, Chickenfoot, thanks for the $5, Chickenfoot.
[314:20.36]Hey, Jerma, I showed my 60-year-old mother your videos, and she loved them.
[314:25.28]My family also watched your Christmas and New Year's streams together, and also I made this.
[314:29.89]YouTube was broken for me, so I uploaded it to Streamables.
[314:36.78]Resident Evil?
[314:45.77]Resident Evil 4?
[314:48.65]Do you eat ass?
[314:54.45]There's the link, for those of you who'd like to see it.
[314:57.43]Thank you, Chickenfoot.
[314:58.07]I'm glad your mother likes the videos.
[315:02.44]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[315:03.58]What is something in your life now that you weren't, you wouldn't have believed five years ago?
[315:09.59]Besides your fans saving over 60,000 seagulls.
[315:12.57]Uh, something I didn't think was, this.
[315:18.52]Streaming on like Twitch.
[315:20.36]I never thought this would ever be possible.
[315:25.66]So, this is, you know, impossible.
[315:28.64]What is playing right now?
[315:31.01]Oh, that.
[315:33.29]But thank you, Lazy Luke.
[315:34.11]Thank you, Binary Man, for the $5.
[315:35.11]Hey, Jeremy, here's a thing that I think chat might like.
[315:39.76]By the way, I did make the stupid musical gnome song thing in FL Studio.
[315:44.18]That thing you have never mentioned, definitely never told us you would stream.
[315:48.52]What's this?
[315:54.95]Spider-Man?
[316:15.45]Is the guy throwing a dynamite at a window in a Spider-Man video?
[316:24.56]This is called O... I don't know, whatever, O-W-O?
[316:31.60]Thank you, Binary Man, for $5.
[316:32.56]Hey, Divas, thanks for $3!
[316:37.56]Drummage Door.
[316:39.56]Drummage Door, thanks for the $1.
[316:40.56]Why are you gonna play me like this, man?
[316:43.00]You kind of hinted you'd check out Lisa, but in VisceraStream, you didn't even know that game.
[316:50.68]Um, I think I was probably just messing around.
[316:52.90]I've heard Lisa a thousand times.
[316:54.76]I was probably just kidding, that I never didn't know what it was or something.
[317:06.71]Bart.
[317:17.32]I want a sample Jerm saying, thank you Divis, and use it as a tag.
[317:23.18]You give $3 every single stream, man.
[317:25.26]Thank you.
[317:29.01]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[317:30.21]You're a handsome motherfucker, you know that?
[317:31.95]I think sometimes, you know, you look in the mirror and you go, I look okay.
[317:39.17]Sometimes you go, maybe not so much today.
[317:48.48]But thank you.
[317:50.16]Appreciate it.
[317:52.12]Jornhorn, thanks for the $1 Jerma.
[317:53.74]It's Jake from the Video Game Accreditation Agency.
[317:57.39]Your gamer license is about to expire.
[317:59.65]Please complete the Chips Challenge level blob net to renew it.
[318:03.81]I don't even know what that is.
[318:16.08]Crypt World.
[318:16.64]Thanks for the $5, Crypt World.
[318:18.14]Play your Automatone.
[318:20.48]I want to see some of your gifts you haven't used yet.
[318:22.88]Oh, that's right.
[318:23.42]I do have... That's true.
[318:26.68]That's true.
[318:26.98]I do have that.
[318:28.47]I do got to... I got to break that out.
[318:30.03]Thanks for the reminder.
[318:33.31]L on a uni.
[318:36.05]Thanks for the $1.
[318:39.88]Thank you.
[318:43.06]E dragon.
[318:43.58]Thanks for the $1.
[318:45.49]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[318:46.81]By the way, it's been six months since I last changed my name.
[318:50.21]Any suggestions?
[318:52.12]As it is now, most streamers give up after Darkstar because they don't want to read a big number.
[318:58.24]Well, the thing about 700,000 games is 700,000 games.
[318:59.94]It's seven syllables.
[319:01.28]So you got Darkstar.
[319:01.90]700,000 games.
[319:02.18]So it's a lot of syllables.
[319:15.91]Darkstar 700.
[319:17.23]It's number 700.
[319:19.47]700.
[319:19.61]Darkstar 7.
[319:23.33]Darkstar 700.
[319:23.95]Darkstar 7-0.
[319:31.85]But, uh, speaking of your name, that should be a very interesting stream on Thursday.
[319:40.00]Suggestions for your name?
[319:40.88]I don't know.
[319:45.43]You want to keep the Dark Star apart?
[319:51.35]There's two years worth of content on there.
[319:55.99]I'm sure we'll blow through it all in about four hours.
[320:02.51]But thanks a lot.
[320:03.72]I don't really know what to... Keep your name the way it is.
[320:06.30]I think it's just fine.
[320:13.56]Jerma's still short.
[320:14.59]Ha ha ha ha.
[320:15.47]One dollar.
[320:15.99]They say five foot one.
[320:17.19]I mean, your name just certainly, you know, there it is.
[320:23.97]Jerma's still short.
[320:26.77]I mean, when was I supposed to be taller at some point?
[320:30.23]How can I still be short?
[320:32.85]Right?
[320:35.32]I didn't plan on getting any taller.
[320:40.46]But thank you for the one dollar.
[320:41.50]Thank you Alec for the one dollar.
[320:42.70]Try not to use a face cam for like three months and don't shave so that one day you'll turn it on and have a full beard.
[320:47.96]Oh, it would look bad.
[320:51.48]I can't.
[320:52.84]Longest it's ever been is really in October.
[320:59.16]The balloon thing.
[321:03.62]No, I can't do it.
[321:04.56]It doesn't grow.
[321:05.02]It just kind of spreads out strangely.
[321:12.39]Hey, Jess, homeboy, thanks for the one dollar.
[321:14.95]I'm still working on that painting.
[321:16.27]Sorry it's taking so long.
[321:19.55]The beard looks good.
[321:20.35]Do you still main Pac-Man in Ultimate even though he sucks real bad?
[321:26.36]Um, I don't really play Ultimate.
[321:29.08]I had a realization when I played Ultimate that I...
[321:33.88]I just can't do it.
[321:35.34]It's very hard to get good at a fighting game.
[321:38.80]You have to put a lot of time into it.
[321:42.06]And getting dunked on by people in like 2v2s when me and Etalyx are playing is just like, holy shit.
[321:49.97]I ain't gonna be able to do this.
[322:01.13]It's still a fun game.
[322:04.46]Still an interesting game, still fun to play.
[322:12.46]Smash is still easier than something like Street Fighter.
[322:15.56]Oh boy, I could never, ever.
[322:18.34]Not in a million years would I be able to handle that.
[322:27.13]But thank you to Drummage Door, again, for the $1.
[322:30.65]Also, to add up to that Lisa Painful RPG donation, I want to underline that these bits are basically my last money from my bank account.
[322:39.63]But if you'd play that game, the entertainment value would be worth it.
[322:41.96]You're the funniest guy I know, especially after Super Best Friends split up.
[322:45.72]Greetings from Finland.
[322:46.52]Love you, man.
[322:50.58]Well, thank you for the $1.
[322:53.18]But I hope you take care of yourself.
[322:55.16]Don't worry about me.
[322:57.75]And to kind of give a very, very clear answer and... I don't... The thing about games and recommendations and things that people want me to play or things that I should play... It really just comes down to maybe one day I would, maybe one day I won't.
[323:16.09]I don't really...
[323:18.08]I don't really have a necessarily like a day-to-day... This is the game I'm gonna play, this is the game I'm gonna play next, this is the game I'm gonna play after that.
[323:25.10]Usually it's like a week-to-week basis when I'm trying to figure out what I want to do.
[323:29.06]So, I don't really have a plan to play like Lisa, for instance.
[323:34.44]I'm sure maybe at some point, like earlier today, I was thinking about doing the Obra Dinn.
[323:37.88]I was like, what do I want to do today?
[323:40.06]Kenshi, or just fuck around in IRL, and it was kind of just a stream where I was just dicking around doing nothing today.
[323:50.35]So it really, there's no rhyme or reason to when I'm going to play a certain game.
[323:57.01]It just kind of happens organically if I want to.
[324:00.85]So I know there's a lot of people that are like, hey, you should play this, you should play this.
[324:03.93]And I've taken a lot of stuff already from that recommendation channel.
[324:09.25]So I do know and I do see that they're worth playing.
[324:14.07]But I just can't, like, guarantee, like, oh, hey, you better stick around because in February, middle of February, you're going to get a Lisa playthrough.
[324:20.24]Like, I don't know if that's going to be the case.
[324:30.42]I'm always open to pretty much anything.
[324:35.46]But take care of yourself.
[324:36.47]Thank you for the $1 donation here.
[324:40.43]And, um...
[324:44.25]Have a great day.
[324:45.33]And a great tomorrow.
[324:51.55]Oh, shit.
[324:51.93]Is he going to play Lisa?
[324:54.21]Is he going to do that?
[324:56.37]Sick.
[324:58.47]Hey, Captain Scruffy, thanks for the $5.
[324:59.69]It was awesome meeting you the other day.
[325:03.81]You as well.
[325:04.99]Thank you so much for the $5.
[325:06.11]And... I love meeting people.
[325:12.80]I love talking to people.
[325:16.37]It was a pleasure.
[325:17.94]By all means.
[325:19.40]Thank you.
[325:21.80]And thank you for the $5.
[325:24.44]ZeroSnaky, thanks for the $1.
[325:28.16]ManDomRequiem, thanks for the $1.
[325:30.62]Stop singing, please.
[325:33.46]I did.
[325:34.14]I did.
[325:36.40]I did.
[325:36.64]Eventually.
[325:41.02]ElCobra, thanks for the $10.
[325:43.14]This was beautiful.
[325:43.76]10 out of 10.
[325:44.30]How have you not hit the top 10 yet?
[325:47.71]Top 10 on the billboards?
[325:51.22]I don't know.
[325:51.86]I'm as shocked as you are.
[325:54.18]I can't believe that my singing voice has not carried me to the top of the charts.
[325:58.32]It should be there.
[326:00.92]But thanks for the $10.
[326:01.73]Smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[326:02.81]The singing was more embarrassing than Jerma Raptor.
[326:04.85]No, it wasn't.
[326:07.19]I don't think that's true.
[326:10.77]No way.
[326:11.29]Not in a million years.
[326:13.38]Thank you, Shmegs, for the $5.
[326:15.40]I love all your content.
[326:16.98]Thank you.
[326:18.79]Thanks for sticking around.
[326:19.47]Thanks for paying me money.
[326:20.63]Thanks for everything.
[326:27.83]Thanks for the $5.
[326:30.43]SuperFrogman, thanks for $1.
[326:32.09]I hope this covers the cost of a name tag for the sneeze gun.
[326:35.55]Would have given it to you earlier, but had to name mine first.
[326:38.03]Seriously, I've been watching since Burger Boy puked.
[326:40.59]I've never once seen one of your videos and not laughed.
[326:43.73]You are a great inspiration.
[326:48.52]Oh, yeah.
[326:50.92]Oh, hey, I forgot about that.
[326:54.30]He did puke on, well, not on camera.
[326:56.56]He ran out of the room and into the bathroom.
[327:01.89]That's a fucked up video.
[327:05.37]Good old Burger Boy.
[327:07.45]Thank you, Super Frogman.
[327:10.63]Thank you, Jess, again for the $1.
[327:11.99]Look how terrifying this is.
[327:13.21]It's pretty terrifying.
[327:26.44]Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[327:27.68]You were forused to play Kenshi for this.
[327:29.84]I did play Kenshi for about, just about six hours.
[327:33.71]So, I did.
[327:35.41]I did do that.
[327:36.19]I did.
[327:36.63]I did.
[327:37.03]I did.
[327:38.91]Thank you, though, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[327:40.23]Thank you, C4G, for the $1.
[327:41.57]Karaoke Boy has arrived and left at the same time.
[327:45.60]Hardcore Candy Store, thanks for the $1.
[327:47.38]I love your IRL streams.
[327:53.91]Sometimes we have some fun.
[327:56.35]And sometimes I just don't know what to do with myself in front of a camera, so I embarrass myself profusely.
[328:03.60]Sometimes.
[328:05.30]SkyKingTV, thanks for the $1.
[328:06.56]Hey, I just finished a stream.
[328:08.18]Only had three people show up.
[328:10.37]But you inspire me, man.
[328:11.45]Thanks for all the laughs.
[328:12.23]Wish I could give you more.
[328:14.69]Don't worry about that.
[328:17.69]Thanks for even the consideration.
[328:20.17]Good luck with your stream.
[328:22.84]It's tough.
[328:27.43]I wish you luck.
[328:31.65]Hey Spuds, thanks for the one dollar.
[328:33.12]What a good bit, Jeremy.
[328:34.40]Very nice.
[329:15.47]Maybe I should have picked a voice that was a little less ridiculous.
[329:22.73]You couldn't hear a goddamn thing I was saying.
[329:27.87]Absolutely nothing.
[329:30.79]You couldn't hear anything.
[329:32.73]I was in there for like a full minute.
[329:35.49]At least, or two minutes.
[329:39.32]Oh my god.
[329:46.64]God damn it.
[329:47.44]Thank you MiniClips for the $10.
[329:49.82]This is the engaging content I come to watch.
[329:54.62]WildFox, thanks for the $1.
[329:56.18]Thank you for $10 though, for real.
[330:05.50]Yeah, I do.
[330:05.98]I do.
[330:06.20]You guys are great.
[330:06.64]Butted heads a little bit today.
[330:07.52]But... Nothing serious.
[330:36.72]And by butting heads, I mean... Me versus myself, in a way.
[330:49.61]If you were here earlier, you probably know what that means.
[330:56.43]But, uh, no, it's great.
[330:59.19]Everybody here is usually 99.9% of the time a fucking joy to be around.
[331:07.85]You know, every 0.001%, somebody says, Germany is short.
[331:12.13]Ha ha ha.
[331:13.05]It's tiny man.
[331:14.11]And you know, that's just 1.0001%.
[331:15.38]But it's all good.
[331:15.88]That's like 78%.
[331:16.30]No, it's not that much.
[331:39.27]But, thank you, WildFox.
[331:42.55]Uh, Avon Grad, thanks for the one dollar.
[331:44.57]Jerma Hart, right back at you.
[331:47.35]Valky, thanks for two bucks.
[331:48.91]Don't worry, man, this stream is great.
[331:51.01]If it was boring, you wouldn't have almost 4,000 viewers.
[331:54.92]Love you, Jerma.
[332:01.78]I can't even believe that there are that many people that would be here in the first place, so, thanks.
[332:04.46]Really.
[332:05.60]Really.
[332:10.50]Really appreciate that.
[332:11.60]Broluck, thanks for the $15.
[332:12.50]I was watching a different streamer on mute.
[332:15.27]Opened your stream and watched the other.
[332:16.97]For a little bit, I thought you were insane at The Witcher 3.
[332:21.05]I wasn't surprised when I realized what was going on.
[332:22.87]It's okay.
[332:23.31]I can go back to pretending you are good at video games.
[332:26.04]Beat, Simpsons, Hit and Run, First Sitting?
[332:28.22]I mean, that's the latest one.
[332:44.23]Thank you for the $15.
[332:45.21]I really appreciate that, dude.
[332:47.67]11-hour speedrun, by the way.
[332:49.17]Yeah.
[332:51.97]That guy bit his controller.
[332:53.11]I didn't.
[332:57.43]Game kind of closed.
[333:00.82]But thanks for the $15, bro.
[333:01.98]Luck.
[333:02.14]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $1.
[333:03.30]I'm definitely checking out Kenshi once I hook up my PC.
[333:05.88]Thanks for showing it to me.
[333:06.68]It's a great game.
[333:11.56]I feel like it just gets better as you play it.
[333:17.97]Thank you Broluck again for the 20 total dollars.
[333:20.59]I just did it again.
[333:21.23]I was looking at Shroud stream on mute with yours in the background.
[333:24.17]I mean, this is just a lie at this point, but I'll give it to you.
[333:27.47]And I thought maybe, wow, he's not a trash video at the game.
[333:39.52]Apparently.
[333:46.52]Thanks for the 20 bucks, Broluck.
[333:50.64]Uh, Yakubu, thanks for the $1.
[333:53.50]Jazz Jelly, thanks for $1.
[333:54.82]Hi, Jeffrey.
[333:56.24]Hey.
[333:56.90]Hi, Jazz Jelly.
[333:59.77]Prodbreaker, thanks for the $3.
[334:02.43]Yo, Jerma, what's up, man?
[334:03.33]I've been watching you since the Jerma is Mad and Jerma Rumble 2K14 days.
[334:08.67]I... I'm... Wait, you didn't know that I streamed?
[334:17.38]I wonder how many people didn't know that I streamed.
[334:21.16]I feel like it's probably a lot.
[334:23.74]We talked about this like two days ago, didn't we?
[334:25.28]Like three days ago.
[334:36.37]Wait, you stream?
[334:39.57]Because from YouTube and all that.
[334:48.36]People still don't know, surprisingly.
[334:50.67]Yeah, I'm gonna have to think about how I want to handle that.
[334:55.15]It's more like internal conflict.
[334:59.21]We have discussed it, but... We don't need to discuss it now.
[335:06.63]Thank you though, Prodbreaker, for three bucks.
[335:09.25]Welcome.
[335:11.87]Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the one dollar.
[335:13.25]This is my favorite OST.
[335:37.41]I gotta compose myself here, I'm fucking losing my mind I really was losing my mind
[335:49.09]Thank you ToshirodoTV for the $1.
[335:59.89]Can't wait for the Kenshi exclusive Jerma Rumble at the end of the year with a full squad of dumb bitches primed for our entertainment.
[336:08.58]I hope Masamune wins.
[336:10.20]Oh, goodness.
[336:15.16]Ugh.
[336:18.84]Thank you, SirTardigrad, for the three dollars.
[336:22.60]Big fan of the Kenshi streams.
[336:24.12]Keep it up.
[336:24.46]You really should keep playing Gungeon on stream.
[336:26.36]It's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.
[336:41.96]Uh... I...
[336:44.59]I don't know if I have the capacity to play it.
[336:47.69]I've watched people play Gungeon.
[336:49.35]It looks great.
[336:51.07]But I think... I feel like I need to really sink time into games like that.
[336:57.28]It's like Binding of Isaac.
[336:59.56]I put hundreds of hours, hundreds and hundreds of hours into Binding of Isaac.
[337:07.03]And Isaac, at this point, is just that game that I could go back and play.
[337:12.69]And have a meltdown after Mario Tennis.
[337:15.81]So.
[337:18.79]But, thank you.
[337:21.45]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[337:22.79]You know, if you value freedom to do whatever the hell you want in sandbox-type games, you should get around to playing Breath of the Wild.
[337:29.88]Though if you ever did choose to stream it, I would suggest maybe only one or two streams, considering how you can get bored when playing long games on stream.
[337:38.89]What the fuck is playing in the background?
[337:43.07]It's like Michael Myers in my house?
[337:50.18]Hello?
[337:50.84]What the fuck was that?
[337:55.98]Alright, I'm just going to mute the desktop.
[337:57.90]That was weird.
[338:01.68]Yeah, Breath of the Wild seems cool.
[338:08.15]I don't know.
[338:10.82]Thank you, The Jewish Bro, for the $1.50.
[338:12.40]Oh, sorry.
[338:14.70]Two, three, six.
[338:17.24]Hold on.
[338:17.80]Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[338:22.43]Thanks for the $10.
[338:24.55]Spread out over about probably 30 minutes or so.
[338:26.83]Thank you so much.
[338:32.67]Really appreciate that.
[338:36.23]Thank you, Ragtur, for the $1.00.
[338:41.99]Dude, I love Nightwing.
[338:43.11]I love his emblem tattoo.
[338:44.18]I have his emblem tattooed on my arm.
[338:45.78]Do you remember where you got that shirt?
[338:47.64]I gotta have one.
[338:48.62]Have you read Nightwing the New Order?
[338:50.62]Hugs and kisses.
[338:52.82]XOXO, how do I end these?
[339:01.32]Face cam and... Wait, what's happening?
[339:05.02]Oh.
[339:07.50]I actually don't know where the hell I got this.
[339:09.32]I think this was on a clearance rack somewhere.
[339:13.01]At one of those music stores.
[339:16.52]I don't remember exactly where I got it.
[339:18.00]I'm certain it was on the clearance rack, though.
[339:22.34]That's all I remember.
[339:23.24]It was like a buy five, get five.
[339:33.51]Ghost hunting?
[339:35.67]What is going on?
[339:40.09]But thank you, uh...
[339:41.87]Brown Cowballs for the $1.
[339:44.47]Thank you.
[339:46.33]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[339:50.29]Garfstones meet the Garfstones of the modern feline family.
[339:53.68]From the land of Toontown, they give bits to Jeremy.
[339:57.16]Yabba Dabba Doo, Jeremy, your trusty feline ambassador hath returned with a new kitty cat viewer in the chat.
[340:03.56]Wait, there are new cats?
[340:04.66]Who are the new cats?
[340:07.54]I bet you thought Garfied was slacking off with his cat-related duties, but no siree, potpourri.
[340:14.38]I know how to say potpourri.
[340:16.52]Garf just got you like a ton of new viewers.
[340:19.79]They're in the chat right now.
[340:20.75]Make yourselves known.
[340:21.57]All cats.
[340:22.19]Did Garf deliver or what?
[340:23.67]I don't see any cats here.
[340:33.69]Thank you, Garfield.
[340:34.39]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[340:35.69]Jeremy, we like watching you play Kenshi.
[340:37.01]Stop pretending like you don't know Twitch chat is full of assholes who lie and fuck with you.
[340:46.13]No, that was not... Come on.
[340:49.43]Let's be completely real here.
[340:55.67]I can... I know the difference between we're fucking with Jeremy, man, and...
[341:04.78]I don't like this.
[341:07.54]There's a big difference.
[341:14.08]Even before we switched to Kenshi.
[341:18.26]You know, come on.
[341:19.56]All you gotta do is look.
[341:29.34]Can Jeremy ban- Can you ban Jeremy?
[341:43.21]Jeremy ban.
[341:44.31]Jeremy ban.
[341:45.25]Can you ban Jeremy?
[341:46.27]Jeremy ban.
[341:52.64]But thank you, Smelly Boy.
[341:53.68]Thank you, Jiraiski, for the $10.
[341:57.00]We caught you earlier.
[341:57.96]Thank you so much.
[342:03.55]And then NoSuperU came in with 14, talked about how, thought about giving 50, don't worry about that.
[342:08.29]And they said, don't let chat get to you.
[342:11.10]No, it wasn't chat.
[342:13.16]It wasn't about, like, the chat.
[342:15.68]It was about the collective... collective boredom that a lot of people were experiencing.
[342:25.75]And even, look, even with a poll, right?
[342:28.37]30, what, like 30% said that they were just like, oh my god, get off the game.
[342:35.65]So... You know, I gotta read that, right?
[342:43.97]So when at least 30% of people are just like, like telling me, hey, I don't like this.
[342:50.85]I read it.
[342:51.34]I have, I'm reading it.
[342:54.50]It's not about, because look, to me, if you don't like a stream or if you don't like a game, that's alright.
[343:02.05]But I, at the end of the day, it's something that I need to either do, change, or take care of.
[343:11.24]You made him sad.
[343:16.60]You don't always have to listen to chat.
[343:19.16]And I mean, I don't, I kind of don't, in a lot of ways.
[343:31.76]But just, but always, but keep in mind, right?
[343:33.92]Just always keep that in mind.
[343:37.52]That I, I, I am reading the chat.
[343:42.94]So, sometimes you look over and it's just... Like, shit, man.
[343:50.08]That's, this, alright, I guess.
[343:56.20]Oh, fuck, he saw all the bad things I've said about him.
[344:11.40]Sometimes you look over and it's shit, man.
[344:13.82]I'll hang in my batch tomorrow.
[344:26.49]But don't take this as me complaining about chat.
[344:32.86]Complaining about things that people say.
[344:35.54]Because like I told you, I know there's a huge difference.
[344:41.24]between banter and boredom.
[344:57.83]I just hope you guys know that I want to make sure every stream is fun, and it's hard to do that.
[345:07.02]And that's almost an impossible task.
[345:17.04]But I'm going to try to do it.
[345:24.79]Thanks for the $14 and $10 here, Dryski and New Superview.
[345:34.95]Well, to kind of expand upon this one final time.
[345:36.17]It's tough.
[345:36.61]Here's one reason why.
[345:37.53]Because I get a lot of requests to do stuff like today.
[346:07.19]Just play a game, and just, hey, let's play something, and play it, and do it again, play that game again, play that game again, that was fun, it was relaxing.
[346:15.25]But it was almost an equal amount of people that would rather see something else.
[346:20.20]So, when maybe, I'd say probably half the people don't want to watch a game like Kenshi, and half the people do, it's kind of this, it's a rock and a hard place.
[346:35.43]It wasn't equal.
[346:36.17]But my point is that there's a lot of people that want to watch me kind of just play a game and hang out.
[346:42.11]And there are a lot of people that want to watch me do something else that's maybe a little more intense or a little crazier or more interesting, right?
[347:06.71]And it's trying to find a balance between those two things.
[347:19.03]Do a live knitting stream?
[347:42.21]But I'm really... I'm really absolutely... I'm just absolutely nitpicking here.
[347:51.48]Because... This is a great problem to have.
[347:56.12]A bunch of people like this, a bunch of people like the other stuff, a bunch of people like the other shit that I do.
[348:04.71]No, I like that so much, I want you to do that.
[348:06.43]No, I like this too.
[348:07.71]That's a good problem to have.
[348:13.06]And I wouldn't even classify it as a problem.
[348:30.18]It means that I have a big audience.
[348:33.96]Yeah, and as the channel continues to grow, I need to start to figure out how to handle stuff.
[348:41.66]Because this channel, look, I come from YouTube, right?
[348:45.01]For years ago.
[348:46.93]Where... I didn't have to... Oh, it wasn't live.
[348:51.97]I could just upload a video and that was it and leave the comments.
[348:55.72]And what did people say about that video?
[348:58.14]This video sucked.
[348:59.80]Oh shit, alright, I'll make sure to change that.
[349:02.66]I'll change that video style.
[349:05.08]In real time, it's almost like... Oh fuck, this is happening right now.
[349:09.85]This shit's happening right now.
[349:13.40]You know, not like days later when I go look at a comment section.
[349:23.20]So it's different.
[349:26.64]And the channel has almost doubled, at some points even tripled in viewership over the last six months.
[349:37.46]It's been absolutely fucking insane.
[349:47.94]Yeah, really, yeah.
[349:56.66]Oh, Jesus.
[349:57.22]That's just me watching a bunch of times in a row.
[350:03.66]Wait, like, what?
[350:05.24]Right now?
[350:05.69]Uh, there's a huge amount of money just came in.
[350:13.35]Right now.
[350:15.95]Uh, thank you, thank you Jango Wizard Spy for these $65.
[350:27.24]65 bucks.
[350:27.82]Hey, I only meant to buy 1500 bits, but it kept on saying purchase failed.
[350:31.94]Turns out it worked every time.
[350:33.91]Rip.
[350:34.95]Anyway, I wasn't here for the beginning of the stream, but I know the kind of situation you're talking about, and I hate it when it happens because it grows from being a joke into being something real.
[350:42.85]Hope you know that fans like myself love anything you put out.
[350:45.41]You're doing it great.
[350:46.11]You're doing great, Dad.
[350:50.93]Well, first of all, apparently Twitch is having a strange bit problem tonight.
[350:55.78]And people are buying way fucking more than they wanted to.
[351:02.76]Holy shit.
[351:08.05]That error is... that's not alright.
[351:12.29]But thank you anyways, regardless.
[351:22.03]Yeah, I... It's hard to even comment on.
[351:28.03]Because I... Do you think I... I don't know how to, like, deal with that.
[351:34.49]I mean, I do to an extent, but... And I am acting like this was a huge... This was a huge problem!
[351:45.68]No, it wasn't at all.
[351:48.24]Essentially, if you weren't here...
[351:51.36]There was a portion of the stream where I felt that people were bored.
[351:55.65]And they didn't want to see this anymore.
[351:59.35]And they wanted me to move on to something else.
[352:00.89]And that's what I felt.
[352:01.97]That's the way I felt.
[352:09.19]And then it was kind of like an equal amount of people were like, No, stay!
[352:11.99]No, go!
[352:12.57]I'm leaving!
[352:13.79]I'm out of here!
[352:14.33]It's like...
[352:17.14]Did you see Barnabas?
[352:18.52]Barnabas just sat down on the bed.
[352:20.86]It's cool, right?
[352:27.22]Germo, you work for Twitch.
[352:28.47]Fix this problem.
[352:33.91]Enter.
[352:38.55]But, no.
[352:39.59]I'll move on from it.
[352:40.33]It wasn't a big deal.
[352:41.01]Might as well talk about it, because...
[352:46.48]Why not, right?
[352:49.10]Thank you for the 65 accidental dollars.
[353:08.21]When Vinny played Red Dead Redemption 2, he finished the game because he enjoyed it and he had the lowest numbers.
[353:12.61]No, but it's not a numbers thing.
[353:16.59]It's not a numbers thing.
[353:18.07]The fact that the viewers were dropping when I started playing Kenshi, that's not the problem that I'm describing.
[353:32.16]I'm talking about people audibly in the chatroom talking about how badly they don't want me to do the thing I'm currently doing.
[353:51.30]audibly typing.
[353:52.34]Right.
[354:12.93]But that's the only reason why I even thought to address it in the first place because I was under the assumption.
[354:18.97]So let's just give an example here.
[354:21.69]So if you have like 4,000 people and that drops down to like 3,000.
[354:26.13]Alright, whatever, that's fine.
[354:28.38]But then like 3,000 people, you know, people are still talking about it.
[354:32.36]Maybe they're still bored.
[354:33.28]They're still talking about it.
[354:35.04]Then, you know, did people leave because they were bored or are people still sticking around hoping that I'll change to something else, right?
[354:49.85]It's tricky.
[354:54.83]Probably both.
[354:55.69]Yeah.
[354:58.42]But regardless, I don't want to smack into this dead horse anymore.
[355:04.20]It's not an issue.
[355:05.02]It's not.
[355:06.24]It's just something to talk about.
[355:16.57]Hey, Pin, thanks for the $1.
[355:18.15]Coffee Cheetos Chicken Compact Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Burger Yab Yab Boy Boot Leg Duck Dynasty Bia Batman.
[355:26.24]I always just threw up when I read that.
[355:28.82]I don't know what that was, Pin, but thank you.
[355:41.39]Ellen Noir, thanks for the $1.
[355:42.31]No, not $1.
[355:42.53]$10.
[355:42.55]Thank you for the $10, Ellen Noir.
[355:47.92]Thank you, Modus Pawns, for the $1.
[355:49.40]Have you ever played any of the BioShock series?
[355:51.06]Yes.
[355:52.78]A long time ago.
[355:54.44]I completed BioShock Infinite.
[355:57.48]BioShock 2.
[355:59.51]I don't know if I... Did I ever play through BioShock 2?
[356:01.67]I think I watched somebody else do it in BioShock 1.
[356:12.32]But thank you.
[356:15.23]I think they got stuck in the mail somewhere.
[356:21.89]I think they're stuck in the mail.
[356:22.71]I think somewhere in that mailbox.
[356:25.41]Thank you for the $1.
[356:25.93]Oh, man.
[356:28.15]Okay, that was good.
[356:42.95]thank you pin for the one dollar hey Jerma just want to take this opportunity to tell everyone in chat that I met you at twitchcon and you have these huge Boston paws for hands and it personally intimidated me when you shook my hand and stared straight into my eyes as you squeezed my hand way too hard
[357:16.73]Uh... The big, huge bucket... I don't even know how to respond to that.
[357:26.46]You just threw me over the edge.
[357:29.36]Straight into my eyes!
[357:30.90]What?
[357:32.60]What?
[357:40.45]Thanks for the $1.
[357:41.23]And yes, I did meet you at TwitchCon.
[357:45.81]I did.
[357:58.61]Yeah, you were a swell dude.
[358:02.91]It was great to hang out.
[358:11.28]But thank you, Ben.
[358:12.96]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[358:13.82]Oh, another thing.
[358:14.70]The Knight Nova raided you.
[358:15.77]He had some really nice things to say.
[358:16.97]I figured you should hear it.
[358:28.17]Let's see.
[358:30.25]Get it on here.
[358:31.78]Tonight I'm going to raid my main man Jerma because I never got to raid him and we played with him ages ago, eons ago, and he's been absolutely destroying it on Twitch.
[358:44.27]I actually actively watch his stuff.
[358:47.90]He's really, really funny.
[358:49.66]Everything that he does is great.
[358:53.38]If you haven't seen any of Jerma's stuff, I guarantee you he'll probably hook you in and you'll probably continue to watch throughout the...
[359:01.39]rest of the night, I'd imagine, if you're looking for something entertaining.
[359:06.53]So we're gonna raid him, he's really cool.
[359:08.95]And I've never raided him before.
[359:10.99]I'll see you guys next week!
[359:14.19]Next- Holy shit, that was fucking- that was an incredibly nice thing to say.
[359:26.18]Wow, I'm like floored right now.
[359:27.62]That was- that's unbelievable.
[359:30.99]Unless he's playing Kenshi.
[359:35.76]Come on, you... You had to say that.
[359:38.28]You had to just say that right now?
[359:45.36]After that, like, 20-minute conversation about trying to make people happy and trying to please everybody and people are bored and... But...
[360:01.17]Nova is back a long time ago.
[360:09.25]I used to watch his fucking YouTube videos.
[360:14.70]He's one of those original, still, still doing it.
[360:20.00]Still having a blast.
[360:21.84]Still making people fucking laugh.
[360:24.34]All these years later.
[360:26.48]So hearing that from somebody like him.
[360:31.23]is that's unbelievable it's incredible every time I've ever watched something that he's that he always comes off as a just fun loving awesome dude so thank you for sharing that clip that that was if you're not following uh nova
[361:00.96]Ruben Haxor, Novo, James.
[361:04.52]I absolutely do.
[361:06.77]I would say the same thing about him.
[361:28.24]Yeah, and, you know, that adds, uh... To kind of wrap up that conversation about how I don't want people to be bored and how it concerns me when chat is saying this, I don't like this, what the fuck.
[361:43.23]This is boring, dude.
[361:46.32]You know, like, it... That, like, hearing shit, like... I want to make sure you're entertained.
[361:53.96]That's very important to me.
[361:56.59]It's the most important thing in the... Absolutely.
[362:02.76]Absolute.
[362:05.54]I take that shit very, very, very seriously.
[362:14.16]And I just imagine scenarios where people come over and they... Something happens and they don't like it and they leave or something.
[362:19.80]It's like, fuck, I wish I could have convinced you otherwise.
[362:26.23]But that's all I'm going to say about it.
[362:29.35]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[362:30.83]I'm not even done.
[362:31.77]What the fuck are you doing?
[362:33.43]I'm out of here.
[362:34.17]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[362:34.89]There's still like another 10 bits to read.
[362:36.19]If you're worried about people being bored, then why do a poll in the first place?
[362:45.47]I mean, that's because I'm curious about what people want to see.
[362:53.63]The reason for the polls is because I have a couple of ideas, and then, you know, most people, whatever they think they would want to see, you know?
[363:16.78]But no, I'm not gonna skip out.
[363:19.04]For some reason, I was at the top.
[363:21.00]So I'm not skipping out on bits, don't worry.
[363:23.82]There's not very many more to do here anyway, so.
[363:28.74]Uh... Drosophilia, thanks for the $1.
[363:33.59]Also, if you like this game, we think you'd really like RimWorld.
[363:37.05]I have 500 hours in it.
[363:38.35]It's one of my favorite games.
[363:39.48]It generates crazy stories.
[363:41.60]Like the time I tried to replace someone's busted leg with a prosthetic, but I chopped off the wrong leg and she had to hop around on one foot for a few months.
[363:49.24]Or the time my best sniper got his entire head bitten off by a lynx.
[363:52.89]And then I regrew it, good as new, with some robo-juice, but his wife remained emotionally traumatized.
[364:00.88]I have heard, I mean, Etalyx plays a lot of RimWorld, and he talks about how it's fucking hilarious and fun, so.
[364:07.31]Maybe one of these days I'll load it up.
[364:13.55]Rad Bruce, thanks for the $10.
[364:14.89]It's my man Evan's birthday.
[364:16.75]Can you give him a shout out and tell him he's been a good boy this year?
[364:21.16]Absolutely.
[364:21.60]Happy birthday, Evan.
[364:24.74]You've been a very good boy.
[364:27.40]Very good boy.
[364:29.69]You deserve snacks and cookies and presents and shit.
[364:35.31]Thank you, Radbriz, for the $10.
[364:38.23]Happy birthday, Evan.
[364:40.09]FGWGWF, thanks for the $10.
[364:41.69]Hey, Jerma just got charged $80 for bits when I only wanted to buy 20 because I was getting the error message.
[364:48.13]I have too many now.
[364:49.23]They need to, like, fix that.
[364:52.25]You know what I mean?
[364:52.81]That's not alright.
[365:00.36]Hopefully that can be resolved.
[365:02.56]Because that's kind of not cool.
[365:07.44]But thank you regardless for the $10.
[365:09.84]Rad Bruce, thanks for $10.
[365:10.76]Another $1k for the rat's birthday.
[365:12.87]Shout out for Evan.
[365:17.03]Happy birthday, Evan.
[365:19.31]The rats are in your house right now.
[365:23.49]In your toilet.
[365:24.83]In the plumbing.
[365:26.59]Probably under your bed, too.
[365:31.50]Thank you so much, Radbriz.
[365:33.84]Flugboy, thanks for the $17.
[365:34.90]Hey, Jerma, hope you're doing alright.
[365:37.02]Accidentally bought $20 worth of bits instead of $5.
[365:39.90]So here's a little extra tonight.
[365:43.01]I would not be... I would not be offended at all if Twitch fixed this and that didn't happen.
[365:51.91]Hopefully, if you didn't want that to happen, that could be resolved.
[365:55.65]What the hell is going on there?
[365:59.46]Is it a joke at this point?
[366:00.36]I don't know if it is.
[366:02.23]I don't think it is.
[366:05.71]Drosophilia, thanks for the $1.
[366:07.12]Also, since you're not streaming tomorrow, I thought I'd say that that's my 21st birthday.
[366:11.68]I've been struggling with depression a lot this past year, and you've helped bring me back to reality a lot of the time.
[366:17.52]Because of the green screen stream and your anticipation to see what people would make with it, I created almost a dozen things, and I realized that I have a much greater drive to be creative than I originally thought.
[366:28.10]Thanks for helping me discover that.
[366:33.08]Hell yeah.
[366:34.84]Thank you, Drosophila.
[366:38.79]That was kind of the point of that whole thing.
[366:41.55]And that's the point of the second one that we'll do as well.
[366:47.55]Having the community dip down into their brains and come up with stuff.
[366:52.35]Because I see you guys come up with some funny fucking shit all the time.
[366:56.27]Interesting stuff all the time.
[367:00.63]I'm so happy that that happened.
[367:03.96]I am beyond, beyond happy.
[367:09.37]I'm filled with joy that even one person got to get their creative juices flowing for a little while.
[367:30.14]I would love to do more stuff like that in the future.
[367:32.81]So thank you.
[367:34.81]Take care of yourself.
[367:38.50]Thanks for sticking around.
[367:41.52]Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[367:43.22]Cheered this last stream, but I think Streamlabs ate my bits.
[367:46.34]Anyways, the other night, my friend and I were watching a meme playlist when we came across this.
[367:55.74]How many of these are there?
[367:57.87]How many of these are there?
[368:00.45]Jameson here.
[368:01.19]Do you eat ass?
[368:02.39]Absolutely not!
[368:08.82]How many of these exist?
[368:11.64]Jameson here.
[368:14.82]Here's the link.
[368:17.44]Thank you, Tingy.
[368:20.92]Piranha Pit, thanks for the $1.
[368:22.90]Do you ever miss Massachusetts?
[368:24.24]I live in Lowell and I'm thinking of leaving myself all the time.
[368:28.90]All of some of my closest friends and family members all live there.
[368:33.74]So, you know, you miss it.
[368:35.48]You miss it sometimes.
[368:36.70]For sure.
[368:42.25]What?
[368:43.05]That has 300,000 views?
[368:45.67]Holy shit!
[368:48.79]I didn't even notice that!
[368:49.99]Jameson here.
[368:51.14]Do you eat ass?
[368:52.38]Absolutely not!
[368:54.58]Jameson here.
[368:57.10]Wow.
[368:57.92]Oh my god.
[369:01.30]But no, it's good to change things up every now and again.
[369:08.26]I lived in Massachusetts my whole life.
[369:13.16]So, this is the first time I've ever been away from New England.
[369:17.20]So... I think it's a good change.
[369:22.33]For now.
[369:24.63]Thank you.
[369:24.91]I think it's probably hard to learn a language at this point.
[369:26.71]You have the easiest time learning a language when you're a young kid.
[369:42.32]And it's almost, for me, at least at this stage of my life, would probably be impossible for me.
[369:53.58]Everyone's watching it on repeat.
[369:55.52]But if I wanted to learn a language, um, that's really tough because it's probably like a bunch that I would think would be interesting to learn and know.
[370:11.53]To learn language in older age though, yeah.
[370:16.94]He's been trying to learn English, that's what those videos he keeps listening to are about.
[370:20.20]That's true.
[370:25.64]Um, I don't know, probably maybe like... I can't even, it's hard to even answer that because that one answer is not right.
[370:37.81]I'd probably want to know at least a couple of European languages
[370:42.96]Maybe be able to understand something like Japanese would be interesting.
[370:47.30]I don't know, that's tough.
[370:57.68]No, no, that's the... That's not why.
[371:00.54]It's just, I just, it'd be interesting.
[371:02.56]I want to go to Tokyo one day.
[371:05.31]So it would be nice to maybe know and understand what people are saying.
[371:08.91]And be able to read menus at a restaurant or something.
[371:12.57]You know?
[371:17.51]By the way.
[371:18.97]Ladies and gentlemen.
[371:20.03]No, I'm not even going to announce this until Thursday's stream.
[371:27.64]I've got an announcement to make.
[371:30.14]A big announcement.
[371:33.20]I have watched...
[371:35.31]My 2019 anime.
[371:38.91]Big announcement coming up on Thursday.
[371:40.57]And we're going to have a conversation about it.
[371:48.17]And I loved it.
[371:48.97]I loved it.
[371:58.70]Thank you P337R for the $5.
[372:01.06]They say, hey man, seems good.
[372:02.36]Hey, how you doing P337R?
[372:05.12]How are you?
[372:08.41]Hope you have a great day, great rest of your night, and a great afternoon, P337R.
[372:21.20]And that is the end of the bits.
[372:24.66]Except for one minute ago, the one Freeman gave $2...
[372:29.20]Hey Jerma, are you aware of the concept of parasocial relationships?
[372:31.90]As a popular streamer, I feel you'd have a unique perspective on the phenomena, especially after moving from YouTube to a platform with live interaction.
[372:39.12]Has it been difficult to change your relationship with chat as the channel has grown, e.g.
[372:43.54]not being able to read subs, chat going too fast to interact with?
[372:48.94]Also, do you make any conscious decisions to discourage the less healthy interactions?
[372:55.15]Um...
[373:00.03]I mean, here's the long and short of that.
[373:04.34]I want everyone here to think that they're part of a fun community, right?
[373:10.18]Because I think they are.
[373:12.44]I think hanging out here, hanging out in the Discord, making friends in the Discord, and being able to have a great, great time together is important.
[373:23.21]But I think that there is, I think there's a line for, at least for me,
[373:31.06]Because it's so hard when I want to give personal attention, but I can't.
[373:42.73]And even something like the end of the stream here is hard to do sometimes.
[373:51.79]Just because of the fact that there's a lot more people, and like you said, chat moves so fast that sometimes it's hard to even know what's going on.
[374:03.33]But for the main, I guess, question that you're asking is discouraging a less healthy interaction, I don't think I do that.
[374:14.16]I think that most of the time, I collectively want to address everybody as a community.
[374:22.84]Because if you start kind of having like a singling out people and establishing what some would call like a parasocial relationship with a singular person or entity on the internet, that's not good both ways, I think, because it almost takes that person out of what the intent of this community is, and that's to have fun and enjoy everything together.
[374:51.95]as essentially one large single entity.
[375:03.72]The hive mind.
[375:07.27]And look, I'll be completely honest.
[375:10.11]I'll be totally honest.
[375:13.17]It's not, it's really not possible for me to even have that kind of a relationship with a singular person in the chat anyways.
[375:22.07]It's not.
[375:22.65]It's kind of impossible for all the aforementioned reasons that you brought up.
[375:37.10]I enjoy this community because we get to all experience it together.
[375:43.83]Not because there's one person or one small group or something that has to be the group that is, oh, well, like, I'm here because of X. I'm here because of Y. I'd rather everyone just enjoy themselves and just be able to take their mind off of whatever they're currently dealing with or if you're just kind of bored and you want to hang out and you want to just kind of fuck around.
[376:06.38]It's more fun that way.
[376:13.54]It's a collective experience.
[376:23.37]Merchandise plans, yes.
[376:27.03]The shirt sale will be here probably in the next week.
[376:37.27]Without a doubt.
[376:39.78]Thank you for the interesting question, Juan Freeman.
[376:46.55]And yeah, it's going from YouTube to Twitch has changed a lot.
[376:49.43]And it's still something I'm trying to deal with too.
[376:51.57]Even though I've been doing this for a couple of years.
[376:53.93]Three years now total.
[376:57.00]It's always interesting.
[376:59.26]But thank you.
[377:00.14]Thank you, Rajasil, for the $1.
[377:01.34]Hey, Jerma, just came to the realization that for the past week or two, I've been doing nothing but watching you non-stop.
[377:06.38]When the stream is down, I've been watching your sorcery streams.
[377:08.96]This is probably really unhealthy.
[377:10.68]At any rate, I recently got sorcery for myself, and I just got around to telling the time serpent to kill himself after making the water serpent eat the sun serpent.
[377:18.51]I'm surprised I never heard this weird fucking game until you.
[377:28.01]Well...
[377:30.98]First of all, Sorcery is probably one of the best games ever made.
[377:36.40]But also, you know, if you have time, if you have free time and you like watching something, then that's... There's nothing wrong with that.
[377:45.74]You know, there's not... I don't think there's anything wrong with watching something and enjoying something.
[377:54.41]As long as it's not negatively affecting you.
[377:58.80]Because if it is, then you might consider trying to figure out some solutions as to how to not have something like that be a negative influence.
[378:20.69]But if it's free time you're talking about, and if it's not negatively affecting your life, then...
[378:28.83]I think that's fine.
[378:31.20]But just be careful.
[378:33.48]With anything.
[378:34.60]This stream included.
[378:39.70]All time management and moderation of yourself is important.
[378:53.35]I would much rather, and I know there's a lot of people that would say, oh, I can't wait till you stream again.
[378:59.51]I'm going to hang out here until you do, right?
[379:03.72]That's incredible to hear that somebody is that dedicated to this community.
[379:07.74]But just please take care of yourself first.
[379:12.68]Give time for yourself.
[379:14.06]Give time for you.
[379:17.32]Allow yourself, right?
[379:24.87]Because that kind of flows back into that question about parasocial relationships.
[379:36.98]Just make sure you're taking care of you.
[379:40.30]You all collectively take care of me every fucking day.
[379:44.61]So, of course I want to make sure that you are taking care of you too, you know?
[380:01.68]Just stream less.
[380:03.46]And I'm streaming way more than I used to.
[380:14.52]We're all... Yeah, we're all... Guys, we're all just a couple of humans, okay?
[380:23.61]He's making the parasocial stronger by saying that.
[380:30.27]No.
[380:31.96]You guys get it.
[380:32.70]You know what I'm trying to say.
[380:33.58]You know what I mean by this.
[380:42.29]But that's kind of the end of the bits.
[380:43.65]We have the credits to roll.
[380:45.23]No soup for you.
[380:45.81]Thanks for the $1.
[380:48.14]And Sir Tardigrad, thanks for the $1.
[380:50.80]This is supposed to go with the other bits.
[380:53.22]Anyways, I have an exam tomorrow.
[380:54.52]Wish me luck.
[380:54.96]Good luck.
[380:55.72]Soup.
[380:57.52]Good luck to you.
[381:00.11]And then thank you for the $1 also to SirTardigrad.
[381:04.60]You should play Gungeon on stream.
[381:05.82]Besides that, loving the Kenshi and the IRL stuff and the general vibes.
[381:09.26]Lots of love, Jerma.
[381:11.48]Thank you.
[381:14.92]You guys are fucking awesome.
[381:16.05]You guys are great.
[381:20.72]sorry that the stream today after and you know what it's kind of it kind of my own doing today because did all like the crazy shit with the irl and the voice changer and then it's like hey look I just like sang karaoke with a fucking auto tune on and I pretended to be a monster in my closet you guys ready for Kenshi that's kind of my own doing as well
[381:51.70]I missed bits.
[381:53.46]Are you sure?
[381:56.58]From when?
[381:57.32]From how long ago?
[382:02.68]What?
[382:02.84]How long ago?
[382:11.17]Because I have... Maybe bits are just all screwed up lately.
[382:22.15]That was three minutes ago.
[382:25.45]Yeah, I got nothing from you from three minutes ago.
[382:27.76]I got two minutes ago, soup seven minutes ago, and then Elizabeth ten minutes ago.
[382:33.44]And I say pee-pee-poo-poo.
[382:39.05]Oh, wait, no, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[382:40.21]This is all the way down here.
[382:44.01]Alright, yeah, this is like, this is down, this got knocked all the way down.
[382:47.19]Okay, so I think I caught some of these here.
[382:50.54]This is Shawnee Noodles for $6.
[382:54.22]Jerma, don't worry about what your viewers want, just keep up the good work.
[382:56.48]By the way, if you drink a gallon of milk on stream, I'll donate $6,000.
[382:59.07]Keep your money.
[383:03.50]Buy something nice for yourself.
[383:05.22]Take care of somebody else.
[383:07.20]Buy somebody something.
[383:07.86]Buy like a nice thing for somebody.
[383:10.32]I'm gonna drink a gallon of fucking milk on stream and like puke.
[383:13.46]That's not gonna happen.
[383:16.20]Trying to kill me.
[383:20.18]Thank you for the six dollars though, Shawnee Noodles.
[383:24.14]Moo means moo, thanks for the $1.
[383:25.42]I was watching the stream with chatty muted and I was so impressed with your ability to make such consistently funny and reusable jokes.
[383:31.10]But then I looked over at my screen and realized my mistakes.
[383:33.92]Anyway, love ya, pop pop.
[383:35.86]Heed the warning.
[383:40.81]Playabigd Danny, thanks for the $2.
[383:43.31]Missed the stream, but still wanted to keep, say, keep up the great work.
[383:45.79]A bad Jerma stream is still a good stream.
[383:47.67]Although, this is not a bad stream.
[383:52.07]I enjoyed myself during this stream very much so.
[383:55.11]From beginning to middle and then the end.
[384:00.47]This is not... I don't... We're kind of... We're like going through two or three different topics and kind of combining them in a bunch of strange ways.
[384:11.88]By no means did I not think this is... I liked this.
[384:14.88]I had fun.
[384:17.27]My concern was lying with other people
[384:23.94]Not having fun.
[384:27.38]You know?
[384:28.38]You know what I'm saying?
[384:28.92]You know what I mean?
[384:35.74]He's finally done playing.
[384:37.26]Somebody just wrote, fuck him.
[384:42.78]Fuck him.
[384:43.96]Oh my god.
[384:45.02]No, I'm not gonna say that, because that's... I'm not gonna say that.
[384:56.18]I just, no, I was reading what somebody in chat said, and I was very shocked by it.
[385:02.10]That was the, that was a shocked, what, the WTF reaction.
[385:06.79]Hey, Dubskeedoo, thanks for the $1.
[385:08.13]Jerma, you're just too damn nice.
[385:10.77]You need to sit chat down and tell them they can't have their made-up BTTV emotes, and they have to eat their Kenshi veggies, or they don't get to go to Disneyland.
[385:19.92]Caring but firm, Jerma, caring but firm.
[385:37.79]Thank you Dovsky, dude Pin, thanks for the $1.01.
[385:43.12]Oh shit I meant to buy one bit to send you but I accidentally bought a hundred times what I was gonna get so here you go, Girma Thank you Moo for the $1.00.
[385:54.55]Just accidentally remortgaged my house to buy bits.
[385:57.35]Amazon's really acting up tonight.
[385:58.71]Thanks a lot, Bezos.
[386:02.72]Is it true that Jeff Bezos makes like $600,000 a second?
[386:08.46]Is that real?
[386:09.58]Is that a made up?
[386:10.38]Is it a meme?
[386:19.61]Okay, so you know... You know when you get to... In the iPad idling game.
[386:26.70]Like, let's just use Cookie Clicker as an example.
[386:32.85]You know when you get to like the end of the cookie clicker where you have like forty- a thousand forty giant factories making the cookies and like ten thousand fucking grandmas making the cookies and you get to the point where you're just like, this game's not fun anymore.
[386:51.34]What do I do?
[386:54.80]That's what Jeff Bezos is right now.
[386:56.32]He has like ten thousand cookie factories and he's just staring at the screen.
[387:11.93]I mean, at some point, I would probably just be like, oh god.
[387:15.75]That would scare me.
[387:17.75]That would be scary.
[387:19.41]Can you imagine how scary that would be?
[387:23.15]If you were making tens of thousands of dollars a second, it would be like, what do I do?
[387:30.22]What the fuck is happening?
[387:31.02]What do I do?
[387:31.38]What do I do?
[387:31.74]Am I going to get in trouble?
[387:33.30]Am I going to get in trouble?
[387:34.58]I would think I was going to get in trouble.
[387:43.15]You gotta do New Game Plus at that point.
[387:48.49]He makes $191,000 per minute.
[387:51.85]I would think I was going to jail somehow.
[387:53.78]I don't know how, but I would think that.
[388:04.38]Like, what do you do at that point?
[388:07.00]What, like, do you do with that money?
[388:11.59]Okay, like, how much is a private jet?
[388:14.91]Okay, we're talking... Okay, somebody figure this math out, because I'm actually curious.
[388:20.85]Okay?
[388:22.65]How much does it cost for every major city in the country, in the United States?
[388:29.49]So, we're talking every capital city.
[388:32.32]You know, obviously we're talking about Las Vegas.
[388:36.68]That's not even the capital of Nevada, by the way.
[388:40.36]But that's like a fun place to be.
[388:44.60]Uh, so... If you got 50 capital cities, and you have a million dollar house in every state, every capital.
[388:56.83]That's 50 million dollars, right?
[389:00.68]So if you have every, you could get, you could go anywhere.
[389:03.78]You could get in a car and just drive for like an hour and you'll end up at another million dollar house.
[389:09.83]Yes, that was good math.
[389:11.33]Okay, so $50 million for a house in every single city in the country.
[389:17.55]And then parked in the garages in those 50, $51 million houses are two $250,000 cars.
[389:28.46]So you got $500,000 per 50.
[389:29.20]That's $2.5 million.
[389:29.84]No, it's not.
[389:30.74]It's $25 million.
[389:31.30]$25 million.
[389:31.66]So now you're at $75 million.
[389:32.89]You got two of the best cars you could ever have in every garage in 50 states.
[389:37.11]Okay?
[389:52.43]And if you want to fly around, you get five private jets that are always fueled up, ready to go.
[389:56.33]Like, $10 million for a private jet?
[389:57.48]$20 million?
[389:57.66]2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20... $200 million.
[389:58.20]$200 million.
[390:12.49]So now you've got, let's just say you got like $200 million.
[390:17.17]And you buy every week, you buy $50,000 worth of food.
[390:22.50]Because you have to stock up all the fridges in your 50 houses.
[390:25.50]5, 10, 15, 20, that's 5.
[390:28.20]50,000 times 50.
[390:31.86]You got 50 fridges stocked with, you know, that's $50,000 a week.
[390:36.54]Because every fridge has to be stocked with the finest quality meats and cheeses.
[390:45.91]Oh, and by the way, you buy a thousand dollars a day in lottery tickets, just for fun.
[390:53.10]How much money is that in like ten years?
[390:59.82]That is not how being rich works, but yeah, go off.
[391:07.50]How do you live in all those houses?
[391:16.92]I'm just taking the piss, obviously.
[391:18.82]I'm just an experiment.
[391:22.89]Wait, I'm a finance major.
[391:24.01]What's the question?
[391:25.55]How much is 50 houses and 50 fridges with two cars and each 50 houses a million dollars each?
[391:30.01]How much does that cost?
[391:37.16]Alright, alright.
[391:37.86]I'm done fucking around.
[391:40.88]Point is, Jeff Bezos has a shitload of money.
[391:52.65]If I had five, if I had ten billion dollars, I would have a fucking LG 6200 water purifying dispensing fridge.
[392:09.31]Damn, those things are like 20 grand.
[392:12.11]They're like 18 grand for like a triple fridge with its own sectioned off water refrigeration utility unit.
[392:29.88]Alright, goodnight everybody, goodnight.
[392:31.43]I'm gonna stop fucking with everybody.
[392:37.31]Filtered water.
[392:38.15]A filtered water filter is like $40, okay?
[392:43.77]At the very end, thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[392:45.51]If Jeff Bezos turned all his money into pennies and flooded the entire world with pennies, then he would be the only human to live on Earth with all his pennies.
[393:00.88]Have a great night, everybody.
[393:02.08]We're gonna let the credits play out here.
[393:05.20]I will see you guys very soon.
[393:11.47]How many fridges could Jeff Bezos buy for all of his houses?
[393:14.13]One for every room.
[393:17.61]You could have a hot tub in every room and a cooling tub in every room.
[393:22.77]If you felt, you know, one day you feel like I'm a little hot in this room, just go in the cool tub.
[393:29.24]Is it a little too cold in your room?
[393:30.72]Just go in the hot tub.
[393:32.28]It's behind you.
[393:42.49]Every single room.
[393:45.45]And have just one room in your house that just has oxygen pumping into it.
[393:49.85]So you can just walk in and just breathe in there.
[393:53.49]And there's a hot tub and a cool tub in that room too.
[393:56.96]and and uh like 10 awesome cool pinball machines from like the 80s yeah just pump oxygen in there and have one of like the one of those like five thousand dollar grills in that room too you feel like having a steak
[394:32.86]That would be bad.
[394:34.07]Don't do that.
[394:45.35]Don't have a grill in an oxygen room.
[394:48.49]That would be not good for you.
[395:00.65]A house- A house with a garden in it?
[395:05.25]No, the garden could be the house!
[395:06.45]You have another house right next to your other house, and it's just a giant green, like, troll house.
[395:13.16]Made it like a giant- It's made into a giant Legend of Zelda tree.
[395:29.00]What is- That face.
[395:41.57]That's where you put your grill.
[395:45.41]Yeah, there was a shitload of subs tonight.
[395:46.75]Thank you guys so much.
[395:52.16]Honest to God.
[396:05.95]Soon, I'm gonna beat Bezos with these subs.
[396:09.91]You'll know if I get to that level.
[396:11.73]Because there will be a fucking grill behind me.
[396:17.28]And there'll be two hot tubs.
[396:20.44]And I'm going to make like, and by the way, I'm going to just make like fucking beef stew in one of those hot tubs.
[396:25.17]No one's even going to go in one of those.
[396:27.67]You could have a permanent beef stew fixture in your house.
[396:32.81]You think that's bad?
[396:33.53]Whoa, always bubbling and boiling and shit.
[396:36.88]You just have to get a ladle and go in there.
[396:38.44]It'll be in one of the fucking 25 rooms in your house.
[396:54.76]I'm afraid he'll cancel the stream Thursday because he can't get 700,000 games to work.
[396:59.00]No, I will.
[396:59.60]Because if that doesn't work on Windows 10, then I'm going to use my Windows 7 laptop and pull that footage through into this computer.
[397:09.41]So that stream is going to happen.
[397:16.33]But thank you, everybody.
[397:18.01]Kind of a long-winded end to the stream here.
[397:21.29]Sometimes we have to chat, though.
[397:24.27]Sometimes we just kind of have to have a little chat.
[397:27.39]See how everybody's doing.
[397:28.19]See how I'm doing, too.
