[00:42.77]Well, I'll be damned.
[00:46.43]Shows up two days in a row, 30 minutes early.
[00:50.63]I'll be damned.
[00:55.13]Who said I was late all the fucking time?
[00:58.19]Tell him about this week.
[01:00.47]That guy Jeremy's always late.
[01:01.81]Not this week.
[01:03.17]We've been early.
[01:05.95]Damn.
[01:07.09]Early.
[01:07.25]Again.
[01:08.15]Again.
[01:12.13]Anyways, hi guys.
[01:14.01]How are you?
[01:15.91]I'll just put a tweet out and we will get this going.
[01:20.23]Friday evening.
[01:21.42]Late afternoon into early evening.
[01:24.16]And would you guys consider 6.30 early?
[01:26.86]Like early evening.
[01:27.92]Like late early... What would you consider 6.30?
[01:30.14]Is that late afternoon still?
[01:32.56]When does late afternoon become early evening?
[01:35.40]5?
[01:35.42]6?
[01:35.98]What time?
[01:43.84]Evening?
[01:45.28]Like 6 o'clock, mid-evening?
[01:48.28]Just evening?
[01:53.30]Evening.
[01:53.92]Still bad EU time.
[01:56.08]Well, I... Listen, I live in the fucking Estados Unidos, okay?
[02:01.58]I live East Coast, Estados Unidos.
[02:04.50]So, like, I stream at like 6, 7 o'clock Eastern.
[02:10.10]That's when I'm awake.
[02:11.26]And that's when I'm alive.
[02:19.45]What do you mean, what?
[02:22.11]We don't got any fucking Spanish-speaking audience here?
[02:25.71]Come on.
[02:28.75]The Estados Unidos.
[02:30.12]That's the United States.
[02:36.60]Bilingual.
[02:37.76]Not quite.
[02:39.20]But I'm ready to go.
[02:41.10]I just want to make sure I have everything set.
[02:44.32]I want to make sure I do a couple of early streams in a row.
[02:47.73]We got SEGA CDs.
[02:49.33]We got a hand... Look, okay, we also have, um... I have, like, five or six CDs.
[02:55.97]And, um, unfortunately, a couple didn't come in the mail yet.
[03:01.18]They're, like, supposed to come in, like, in a few days.
[03:03.76]So I just got the emulators for them.
[03:07.17]So, yeah, we are going to use an emulator on a few games.
[03:10.91]But, like, I bought them, and I own them, and I own the SEGA CD.
[03:14.25]So, what, what, what, what, am I gonna get in fucking trouble for that?
[03:17.49]I own the fucking games.
[03:18.76]I own the SEGA CD.
[03:20.30]It's sitting right here.
[03:22.50]Not gonna, like, big fucking deal, okay?
[03:30.50]What did I study at university?
[03:31.80]Uh, communication.
[03:34.70]Go get him, SEGA.
[03:38.30]Criminal scum.
[03:41.08]Alright, let's go.
[03:42.55]Let's take a second.
[03:43.65]Let's wait for people to trickle in.
[03:47.67]And who knows, the emulator shit might not even work.
[03:50.97]I very, very, very briefly tested it.
[03:53.03]And it's only for like two or three games anyways.
[03:57.25]And I own them.
[03:58.61]Okay, we're gonna start with Lethal Enforcers.
[04:06.10]Lethal Enforcers is... It's not like the SWAT game.
[04:13.32]It's like a... Mad Dog McCree.
[04:16.80]But only you're like a police officer.
[04:19.68]Who knows?
[04:20.28]It might be immediately ejected.
[04:23.07]We're about to find out.
[04:29.25]Let's just get over to it.
[04:30.15]Let's close this.
[04:34.39]Pull it over here.
[04:34.95]Blue screen.
[04:37.27]and hit the power button here and begin.
[04:41.09]I'm gonna do it with my foot.
[04:43.67]Bingo.
[04:48.01]Checking disk.
[04:52.01]I love the startup music.
[04:54.85]It's so... It's like somebody made that in five minutes.
[05:03.77]How come there's no audio on this?
[05:05.23]Usually there is, isn't there?
[05:08.80]Lethal Enforcers TM is a trademark of Konami.
[05:11.27]Is it a Konami game?
[05:13.55]Oh, damn.
[05:16.49]You know it's going to be fucking good.
[05:18.81]You know a bunch of people worked on this and went tried and true, working as hard as they could, and then Konami got rid of them and then sold the game.
[05:26.70]We're talking fucking relevant comedy.
[05:29.06]Hey, Dr. Fudge, thanks for the 10 bucks right off the bat.
[05:32.58]Jerma, I am actually sick.
[05:34.06]Please kill a bad guy for me.
[05:35.48]I will.
[05:36.58]I will.
[05:36.86]Don't you worry.
[05:38.22]Lethal Enforcers.
[05:38.82]This is a light gun game, by the way.
[05:41.78]And I don't, uh... I don't have... I don't have a light gun.
[05:48.92]I hope that's not gonna be a problem.
[05:54.64]Alright, here we go.
[05:57.21]Oh god, this is gonna be a huge problem.
[06:04.17]I didn't... That was just... Alright, press start.
[06:07.71]Player one, gun, joy, gun and gun.
[06:10.69]I don't understand.
[06:12.29]Player one, gun, one joypad, two, gun and gun, two player joypad and gun.
[06:17.74]Oh, I get it.
[06:18.22]Okay.
[06:18.96]It's just one player joypad.
[06:21.96]Let's go to the options.
[06:22.70]Make sure we're not missing any like fucking FOV sliders.
[06:25.82]Game mode, arcade practice, sound mode, sound check, sound check.
[06:33.15]Oh, shit.
[06:37.16]Alright, who cares?
[06:37.94]All this shit's gonna work.
[06:41.33]Not loading PCM data.
[06:42.67]Alright, let's go.
[06:46.45]We have to be a shitty and do it like this.
[06:53.05]That's me.
[06:54.59]How do you shoot the gun?
[07:02.52]The Bank Robbery Episode 1
[07:07.26]Okay, here we go.
[07:13.74]Got him.
[07:15.19]Oh.
[07:16.31]Oh god, this is gonna- Okay, this game ain't gonna work, guys.
[07:19.87]I'm gonna pick up a gun.
[07:21.71]How do you reload a gun?
[07:22.55]I think I have to go off the screen.
[07:25.43]No, it's just a C. Watch out with the gun, don't shoot the guy.
[07:30.38]Nah, I think I can get this.
[07:32.16]You don't have to be exact.
[07:39.67]I love when they slide in.
[07:42.23]The whole floor is made out of fucking cheese grease.
[07:45.35]What?
[07:45.51]Shit, continue.
[07:55.52]Okay, let's just talk about the extreme difficulty.
[07:58.11]Like, I'm gonna bring it up a thousand times.
[07:59.95]Not having a light gun and using a controller is like... Your parents bought you this on Christmas and forgot to get you a light gun.
[08:06.53]They didn't think you needed it.
[08:08.01]And guess what?
[08:08.48]You don't.
[08:08.74]I'm talking about one of the greatest fucking video game players to ever live.
[08:14.12]You think I need a fucking light gun?
[08:22.66]I'm doing alright.
[08:23.22]I say that and then I miss it a thousand times.
[08:26.56]Come on.
[08:31.68]Okay, that guy was a bad guy.
[08:34.02]Good commentary.
[08:35.34]That guy was a bad guy.
[08:37.54]What's this?
[08:40.26]Did I do it?
[08:42.26]I won.
[08:42.46]And now we're outside.
[08:49.14]Don't shoot the random lady in the blue dress.
[08:50.84]Got it.
[08:53.35]Good guy.
[08:55.55]I think that cop just got shot.
[09:00.03]I'm not gonna lie, this game probably would have been really fun in the arcade.
[09:06.20]Just watch out for the fucking Christopher Walken that comes up.
[09:13.72]So there's a Lethal Enforcers 2 that we're also going to play.
[09:19.13]Shit, I only got four continues.
[09:28.23]Are we still in the first level?
[09:38.35]Why is the guy in the front always have the... nice separating the audio tracks, I will say.
[09:47.58]Somebody has to have played this game a lot, right?
[09:50.86]Somebody probably streamed this game.
[09:54.20]Am I the only person that's ever streamed this game?
[09:55.72]Definitely not.
[09:56.32]Somebody's like, oh, and there's a continue.
[09:57.84]It's okay.
[09:58.46]Gotta get that guy, though.
[09:59.48]No, I'm not.
[10:01.02]Alright, level two complete.
[10:09.23]What else is there in Lethal Enforcers?
[10:13.57]Now we're in a car.
[10:18.65]Yeah, I'm not like... I'm not even... Is the car gonna crash?
[10:23.53]Wait, what?
[10:25.61]How many... Is that guy just GTA dead with his face on the wheel?
[10:31.02]I think he is.
[10:35.72]I like it.
[10:36.22]How many people are in this car?
[10:37.52]There's like fucking 30 people in this car.
[10:42.93]That guy was doing a really good job for driving while he was fucking dead.
[10:54.92]Here he comes.
[10:55.26]He's gonna get up, and I'm gonna shoot him right in the head.
[11:00.17]Good music, too.
[11:00.79]Yeah, you guys think about my house right now.
[11:04.27]I'm actually at, like, Papa Gino's.
[11:05.75]I'm at my, like, local pizzeria.
[11:11.75]I feel like I played this in, like, at, like, a local joint.
[11:15.48]I never played this in the arcade.
[11:16.52]This was never at an arcade.
[11:18.79]This was always at like a really weird place, like the fucking candy store.
[11:22.39]No, it wasn't.
[11:23.93]What am I talking about?
[11:24.59]What a candy store?
[11:25.55]There wouldn't be like a game where you shoot guns at a fucking candy store.
[11:30.07]At like a lo- There was a local seafood restaurant that had this shit.
[11:33.59]And it was not a chain.
[11:38.03]Papa John's?
[11:38.71]Oh, no fucking way, dude.
[11:40.91]You wanna start the Papa John's versus Papa Gino's debate?
[11:43.17]I didn't have a chance to shoot that guy.
[11:46.41]Alright, this is a two-door, so only one other person can be in this car.
[11:48.65]Alright, that's it.
[11:49.87]No one else can be in that car unless he was lying on top of that guy.
[11:53.47]Yep, okay, that guy was like lying in that guy's crotch area.
[11:57.89]Anybody else?
[11:58.91]Yep, okay.
[12:00.28]There's three people in that fucking passenger side.
[12:02.46]Anybody else?
[12:06.32]Those guys are having like a dog pile in the front seat.
[12:10.90]Papa John's is fucking dog shit compared to Papa Gino's.
[12:14.48]Like, no way.
[12:16.72]What is this?
[12:19.17]Papa John's like the... Hold on, I think we might have a boss battle here.
[12:23.17]Chemical waste service.
[12:25.71]Oh, it's a boss.
[12:39.31]This fucking guy needs a light gun?
[12:45.89]Saved.
[13:02.37]think this fucking guy needs a light gun give me a fucking break unit five out wow what oh no no what happened come on all over the fucking cds all over the cds streams over oh it's in the SEGA cd wait a minute oh fuck hold on actually 68 that's a fucking d plus I'll take it
[13:31.96]It did get all of the CDs.
[13:34.14]Whatever.
[13:39.23]That is like a couple of things ruined, though.
[13:46.05]D+.
[13:47.35]Too many rookie mistakes.
[13:48.25]Reloading.
[13:48.85]What?
[13:55.62]I just beat it.
[14:01.46]I just beat the mission, like, what?
[14:03.84]I just beat your mission and I have to do this again?
[14:08.28]What?
[14:13.91]Too many rookie mistakes.
[14:15.39]Do I have to get like a C?
[14:15.99]I have to get... D is passing.
[14:16.83]60% is passing.
[14:17.29]I got 68.
[14:17.59]God damn it.
[14:32.02]Hold on a second.
[14:33.88]I'll get this fucking thing out of here.
[14:37.02]In what world is 68% not a passing grade?
[14:40.24]I coasted through fucking college.
[14:42.40]I coasted through high school with a 68%.
[14:44.92]And look at me now.
[14:46.26]Look at me now, fucking Mrs. Stevenson.
[14:49.07]Talked about how I never was going to fucking be anything in my whole life.
[14:52.61]68% on that fucking exam.
[14:54.39]Look what I'm doing now.
[14:56.73]You fucking bitch.
[15:05.10]I'm sorry.
[15:06.36]I'm sorry.
[15:07.00]I blew off the handle there.
[15:16.75]You fucking piece of shit lady.
[15:18.31]It's alright.
[15:22.61]Don't worry.
[15:24.73]Back in action.
[15:32.62]Thank you to all the people giving bits.
[15:36.86]Satanic Santa, thanks for the five dollars.
[15:41.22]Jerma, I now move boxes for a living, so I never got to catch your stream.
[15:47.26]Finally caught one.
[15:48.15]Now take my money and keep shooting the baddies.
[15:50.55]I will, because now we're playing Lethal Enforcers 2.
[15:54.27]Thank you, Satanic Santa.
[15:55.15]Thank you to Tula Productions, also Captain Frodo for the two bucks.
[15:57.41]Here's to the light gun fund.
[16:00.71]Tula, you ran into Sprint commercials today, and your gamer's license is fucking, is fluking.
[16:05.29]You're such a rookie.
[16:06.07]No, I'm not.
[16:08.37]Now we're playing the second one.
[16:09.57]They've improved since the last one.
[16:17.14]Now we're in the Wild West.
[16:21.04]This one actually might be pretty good.
[16:27.54]It's possible.
[16:33.99]Best in the West.
[16:34.81]Now let's just go.
[16:38.47]Lethal Enforcers 2.
[16:39.71]Why is this... I don't understand how this is Lethal Enforcers 2 and the last one was like a police gun game.
[16:51.60]Are we going?
[16:52.88]No, this is a demo.
[16:54.04]Alright.
[16:54.50]Now I know I gotta get more than a 68%.
[16:56.00]No, there was no grading systems in the Wild West.
[16:58.06]You just killed each other.
[16:59.75]Why do I have to worry about that?
[17:01.75]Game mode, difficulty, normal, sound mode is fine.
[17:04.83]Player 1 joypad.
[17:07.35]There was no tests.
[17:08.72]There wasn't like a police examination.
[17:10.26]It was you shoot a guy in the face because he like fucking stole... From you.
[17:19.26]I was waiting for the fucking game to load and I'm just like... Oh, here we go!
[17:21.92]Alright, the bank's been robbed.
[17:25.76]You got it.
[17:26.14]Here we go.
[17:31.94]Look at the fucking graphics.
[17:33.10]Look at the audio and the graphics are much better.
[17:37.33]Well, I shot you before you... Yep, I got this.
[17:47.83]Fuck, what, I shot that guy, I already shot that guy!
[17:50.02]Oh, you have to shoot them more than once, fucking evolution!
[17:55.08]What a levolution.
[18:00.78]Yeah, apparently I can't hit the broad side of a barn, apparently.
[18:07.50]Alright, this one, you need a light gun for this one.
[18:10.20]I have ten credits though.
[18:23.34]They only had two lines to record?
[18:26.97]You couldn't have recorded three lines?
[18:30.25]Even a third line would make this a little less painful.
[18:36.81]This gang sure doesn't have very- NO!
[18:43.64]Jesus Christ.
[18:47.58]In what world is like that okay though?
[18:50.24]Why wouldn't you want to record like... Okay, there's a third line.
[19:03.83]You ain't gonna catch me, Sheriff.
[19:04.77]They've evolved.
[19:08.25]Shotgun.
[19:09.75]Cannon gun.
[19:10.75]Nice.
[19:12.95]That was pretty sick.
[19:15.77]That was pretty sick, if you ask me.
[19:16.87]That was perfectly executed.
[19:25.22]Don't run into the line of fire!
[19:27.00]God damn it.
[19:28.56]I don't want to use a bunch of tokens.
[19:32.36]I don't have to fucking put like a coin in the SEGA CD.
[19:38.34]Got it.
[19:42.43]Come on.
[19:43.93]Keep moving.
[19:47.07]My summer car very much proves I can hit a broadside car.
[19:51.37]This is true.
[19:55.48]Will you be doing any more beat the game challenges?
[19:57.10]Yes.
[19:59.32]We just need a game to do it on that we can try to beat him.
[20:02.40]Cannon Lynch was a very special thing.
[20:04.15]Hold on, I need to do this.
[20:04.99]I need to scratch my eye.
[20:07.15]Cannon Lynch was a special experience because that game... Hold on, I'm sorry.
[20:14.69]That game is actually like three and a half hours long.
[20:16.49]It's like a four hour long game.
[20:19.10]Like, it couldn't be any worse.
[20:24.36]Hit that, Armin!
[20:28.23]Eight continues.
[20:30.56]How many continues does it take before you, like, fail the mission?
[20:37.40]Like, are there any other games that are less than four hours long?
[20:40.19]Shit.
[20:42.87]How many fucking times do I have to shoot these people?
[20:44.67]I had to shoot the guy, like, nine times.
[20:52.26]Gatling gun.
[20:56.57]Gatling gun is very... Nice frog jump.
[21:02.27]By the way, they're saying, you ain't-a gonna get me.
[21:04.15]Listen to it.
[21:06.88]You ain't-a gonna get me!
[21:08.34]They're adding an A. They're being like Super Mario.
[21:10.60]Remember Super Mario 64 when he's like, you ain't-a gonna... Mario reference.
[21:19.94]You can do Army of Two.
[21:22.98]Army of Two is no longer online.
[21:27.10]See?
[21:27.76]You ain't a gonna get me.
[21:28.52]You ain't a gonna get me.
[21:31.22]You ain't a gonna get me.
[21:32.68]Well, I am a gonna get you.
[21:42.75]Frog jump.
[21:44.07]The fucking frog jumpers are the hardest ones to get rid of.
[21:46.89]They're definitely the most dangerous of all the enemies.
[21:49.33]All I've been doing is shooting people in the legs.
[21:56.58]Boss fight.
[21:59.48]Is it gonna be just like the first one?
[22:03.50]Hmm?
[22:04.82]There he is.
[22:07.94]Oh, yup, just like the first game.
[22:16.09]It's just the same game, just like a slightly different scenario.
[22:26.37]How is this any different, by the way?
[22:38.10]Alright, we got him halfway there.
[22:44.50]Can't even fucking touch me.
[22:51.83]Can't even touch me, dude.
[22:58.05]Fucking find me a guy that can do this without getting touched without a light gun.
[23:02.24]And I'll know you're a bullshitter.
[23:13.26]See I started fucking saying something and I just shut up everybody everybody quiet Jeremy shut up Jeremy That's got way too much health Alright, he's dead
[23:42.54]It's over.
[23:42.92]Okay, I win.
[23:46.00]Congratulations.
[23:48.40]This fucking... This water all over my desk.
[23:52.83]Shots.
[23:53.73]Accuracy.
[23:55.53]57%.
[23:55.65]What we... Okay, that's an F. That's an F. What'd I tell ya?
[24:05.86]There ain't no fucking grades in the Wild West.
[24:14.36]Told ya.
[24:17.66]Told ya!
[24:21.91]Oh, that was an innocent victim.
[24:24.55]I just shot the guy driving the stagecoach.
[24:30.49]Well, get the fuck out of the way!
[24:31.61]Why are you going over there?
[24:32.71]There's too much going on.
[24:36.87]I need a partner.
[24:37.96]You know what I mean?
[24:40.64]Look at on the right.
[24:41.50]Somebody's designed to be playing on the other side.
[24:45.86]Like, you can't even beat this without a partner.
[24:50.48]Somebody would be covering the guys and the horses, and I would be covering the carriage.
[24:55.78]We'd be working together as a team.
[24:57.11]Remember, you have to work together in anything, in all facets of life.
[25:01.75]You need to work together with people.
[25:03.27]With your friends, with co-workers.
[25:05.27]You can't do everything alone.
[25:07.09]You never should expect that you're gonna do something by yourself.
[25:15.77]I just tried to shoot the horses.
[25:17.19]I don't know why.
[25:18.76]I'm a fucking terrible player.
[25:23.60]I love how innocents just ride up here too.
[25:28.27]You'd think you wouldn't do that.
[25:30.31]It's hard to even tell.
[25:31.01]Some of these guys are just riding.
[25:36.79]I will say, though, this is the most video game of all the games we have played in the last, like, two days.
[25:44.62]This is the most of all that could be classified as a video game.
[25:55.80]So, don't let anybody tell you on the stream that, like, Jeremy played SEGA CD games, like, 17 of them, and didn't play one game.
[26:03.05]Because we did.
[26:03.43]And we did pretty damn good.
[26:06.79]Fucking with a controller in his hand.
[26:12.43]That guy was like calling in the cavalry.
[26:22.92]Surgical strike or riot.
[26:24.68]No.
[26:25.72]No.
[26:25.94]We got a lot to get through tonight.
[26:32.48]I'm just here to be in front of your gun to say don't shoot me.
[26:34.60]I know.
[26:35.28]It's just stupid.
[26:45.97]This is just fucking Donkey Kong.
[26:49.82]This is just that one level in Donkey Kong where he throws the barrels at you.
[26:55.64]This is... I can't like... Who's driving this thing?
[27:09.32]I can't take these explosion sounds.
[27:15.78]I don't know, guys.
[27:16.45]This is like... You got the upper body strength of a fucking Batman.
[27:23.51]We all know he's the strongest of all the superheroes.
[27:32.72]This was designed for two human beings.
[27:34.44]Can you imagine if I had a friend unloading on him right now?
[27:39.28]And I protected us?
[27:54.52]I'm going to be quiet here.
[27:55.42]I don't want to lose my four credits.
[27:57.40]I lost it already.
[28:07.35]Spamming does not do anything.
[28:08.79]You've got to be meticulous.
[28:10.05]Maybe it does.
[28:13.61]I can't even tell.
[28:19.34]My fucking hand hurts.
[28:22.19]I'm giving myself, like, fucking arthritis in my right hand.
[28:30.43]Alright, it might be time to give up.
[28:38.36]I'm fucking out of here.
[28:39.86]I just gotta beat this weird, like, French guy throwing barrels.
[28:49.66]Okay.
[28:51.00]Whew.
[28:54.07]What the fuck?
[28:59.62]Fully automatic revolver.
[29:00.76]I got even lower.
[29:02.80]48% accuracy.
[29:03.06]Oh well.
[29:03.32]Ooh, bonus stage.
[29:04.08]What am I gonna do?
[29:26.24]That was close.
[29:42.87]Is it okay?
[29:45.15]I think it's okay.
[29:45.71]That didn't do too bad.
[29:57.08]Oh, God.
[29:59.26]Alright, like, I got two credits.
[30:02.15]Might as well just go to the end, right?
[30:05.41]We're not gonna play this one again.
[30:06.55]I shot that lady in the fucking head.
[30:10.97]Now they're throwing knives.
[30:19.79]Oh, come on!
[30:21.49]That guy was fucking two feet tall!
[30:23.67]Why is everybody three feet tall?
[30:27.77]Did you guys notice that?
[30:28.73]Everybody's like fucking two feet tall over here.
[30:33.83]These guys are fucking tiny.
[30:41.10]Shut up.
[30:42.86]I didn't shoot through the bottle?
[30:47.14]Oh my god, we're almost out of credits.
[30:52.52]I don't even care.
[30:53.76]What if I'm hitting the off button the second I lose?
[30:56.40]But we do have to get our, like, final score, though.
[31:04.52]This is fun, though.
[31:06.22]Like, this is fun.
[31:09.38]Can I do the whole mission with one fucking life?
[31:11.79]I think I can.
[31:12.27]The whole entire mission.
[31:18.71]That lizard's a lady!
[31:21.31]That was an innocent.
[31:22.29]That was an innocent to me.
[31:24.59]She walked over like she was an innocent.
[31:25.97]I don't care.
[31:33.88]Whatever.
[31:39.60]Whatever.
[31:40.90]Okay.
[31:44.14]On to this one.
[31:53.71]This one actually has potential to be very, very fun.
[31:56.73]Might be.
[32:01.40]I don't know.
[32:02.64]I said that before in at least a couple of these.
[32:04.62]That is not necessarily the case, right?
[32:06.56]Here we go.
[32:14.58]I'm going to give this one a little bit of time.
[32:23.77]I don't even know how to spell the title of this game.
[32:29.55]Well, I'll find out in a second because it's going to be on the screen.
[32:32.39]And here it comes.
[32:41.66]No, this is not Jurassic Park, although it does look like it.
[32:52.46]Good start.
[32:54.08]Fahrenheit.
[32:58.56]The Firefighter game.
[33:07.80]Hey, Cigarette Spaghetti, welcome back.
[33:09.81]Screamer takes rare opportunity to make fun of someone for being shorter than him.
[33:15.59]That was a pretty rare opportunity.
[33:19.11]Thank you so much, Cigarette, for the 50 fucking dollars.
[33:22.80]Now we're gonna play Jurassic Park Firefighter Edition.
[33:25.30]Alright, let's press start.
[33:30.72]Thank you, Lyle.
[33:31.38]Please fo- I already- I did this before the stream.
[33:38.77]Jesus, you couldn't give me... a better fuckin' splash screen?
[33:46.52]This is just what it looks like when you're burning to death.
[33:51.62]Also, thank you, Mostly Lost, for the five bucks.
[33:54.36]Appreciate it.
[33:56.36]Let's get started.
[34:00.92]Here we go.
[34:06.63]Please.
[34:07.19]Oh man, it hurts.
[34:07.87]Alright, start.
[34:09.61]We're gonna get this one some time.

[34:24.44]I'll be with you in a second.
[34:26.14]Literally a second.
[34:27.02]I'm one of the only people that literally means that when I say it.
[34:30.65]Typically, I'd leave for like 10 minutes and come back.
[34:33.09]Nope, just had to put a hat down.
[34:34.37]You know, you're pretty good.
[34:35.99]You're pretty good.

[35:30.76]Nice mugshot with the paper, kid.
[35:32.60]We got a lot of glory around here.
[35:34.02]Stinky.
[35:34.46]Remember, first time was lucky.
[35:39.10]Sorry, it's too pixelated.
[35:41.52]I can't read it.
[35:42.84]Sorry.
[35:46.27]See that back wall over there?
[35:47.93]Yeah, it's a fucking blurry mess, but I promised it said something very prestigious.
[35:57.12]What is this fucking audio?
[35:58.40]Alright, let's get in there and search and rescue.
[36:02.54]Is my name hot dog?
[36:03.36]Did I just take a gun?
[36:04.88]Boys and girls.
[36:23.88]Okay, well, we're aware that this is for children.
[36:27.45]We're going up.
[36:28.95]Alright, let's go straight in.
[36:32.39]Come on, boys and girls.
[36:33.93]Go into a burning building, kids.
[36:36.27]Okay, we're going right.
[36:42.07]Boys and girls, like, walk into a fucking fire, little kids.
[36:45.37]Like, what the fuck?
[36:46.31]I'm looking for somebody.
[36:48.75]Wow, that's a scary flame.
[36:51.76]Oop.
[36:53.43]You're a person?
[36:53.99]Uh... Yeah, we're going straight.
[37:02.13]Rookie, check your breathing.
[37:03.86]You don't want to use up all your air.
[37:06.30]Are we scuba diving?
[37:11.38]Why are we, like, under the fucking sea?
[37:13.20]We're not gonna have a lot of time in here.
[37:14.88]This place is gonna take off any minute now.
[37:18.43]How am I supposed to do anything in here?
[37:19.89]You got us running around in circles.
[37:23.11]Get your act together or I'm going to pull you guys out.
[37:25.81]Not a good move, kid.
[37:31.68]We're just walking from... Okay, so... Your incompetence is going to get someone killed.
[37:36.36]It's a damn good thing Stinky was using his head.
[37:38.92]You're going to have to move a little faster if you ever hope to get the girl.
[37:46.52]Good thing Stinky was using his head.
[37:51.26]We have to go in and save him.
[37:52.26]I'm not done.
[37:53.42]We're not done.
[37:56.44]Let's go.
[37:57.36]Get me in there.
[38:00.13]How dare you, boys and girls!
[38:03.11]You children are so incompetent running into that fucking burning gri- Person?
[38:09.21]Person?
[38:09.55]Where are they?
[38:10.43]Right there.
[38:16.52]Where?
[38:18.48]Is that me?
[38:21.62]Yes.
[38:23.04]What?
[38:23.42]Yes, maybe, no?
[38:25.10]What are you, what?
[38:27.92]What are you talking about?
[38:30.73]What?
[38:32.61]Was I supposed to be okay with him stealing something?
[38:34.65]I don't fucking get this.
[38:38.03]I couldn't select anything.
[38:43.49]Yes, maybe, no.
[38:46.97]Person?
[38:52.36]Alright, well, turn around and go back the other way.
[38:56.52]I heard a lady saying, like, let me out.
[38:58.42]What door was she in?
[38:59.04]Listen.
[38:59.28]Where are you?
[38:59.76]Are you in this door?
[39:17.66]She's, where the fuck is this lady?
[39:19.14]She's not even in here.
[39:25.14]Okay guys, let me just fucking, this is just, I can't even see what's on the screen.
[39:29.51]This is nobody going in circles.
[39:35.43]Where else am I supposed to go?
[39:49.94]Did I just get burnt up?
[39:51.04]Alright, well, that... The screaming has stopped, so that means that, uh... That means that the lady I believe is dead.
[40:04.99]Stinky, help me.
[40:09.54]Okay, when it blinks on the screen, does that mean, like, that's, like, where you'll be going, I guess?
[40:15.20]I just, like, zoomed in on my face.
[40:16.76]I'm gonna die in here.
[40:20.31]Yeah, the screams are over, which means... Unfortunately, that means that she ain't alive anymore.
[40:28.27]What did I do?
[40:28.87]I didn't just go back in that same room, did I?
[40:31.15]Okay, here we go.
[40:32.79]Where?
[40:33.29]I do!
[40:34.23]Where is this person?
[40:36.41]Is it the TV?
[40:52.56]Wait a minute.
[40:53.04]Wait a minute.
[40:54.06]Wait a minute.
[40:55.52]The TV was making the noise?
[41:01.23]What were they watching?
[41:04.23]Where else am I supposed to go?
[41:09.85]Are there any other rooms in this house?
[41:13.01]Chief, you better have Stinky standing by.
[41:15.41]Looks like we might need him.
[41:17.43]Oh no, Stinky needs to come in here now.
[41:20.05]Sorry, I was being pranked by a f- That was so dumb.
[41:28.83]Like, what kind of fucking video game?
[41:30.83]What?
[41:36.57]You don't spin in circles.
[41:40.33]Okay, when you spin in circles, I don't know which way is left and which way is right.
[41:44.75]There's Sparks flying all over the neighbor's room.
[41:48.48]Person?
[41:50.70]I have no idea.
[41:52.92]Somebody's gonna have to... We're gonna have to send in Stinky here in a minute.
[41:59.37]Where is this family?
[42:01.01]Fam... No, just... It's this fucking hallway again.
[42:08.83]It's just a giant red maze.
[42:12.01]And a TV that yells, help me.
[42:13.57]Alright, so... Somebody go ahead and pull it up.
[42:18.21]Somebody go ahead and pull up the fucking walkthrough.
[42:29.05]I was already in- Let's go left.
[42:37.91]No, no, no, we're just doing the same thing.
[42:39.73]Nobody in the giant bathtub?
[42:40.71]No, there's nobody- I don't think there's any people in this house.
[42:47.51]Okay, it's clear.
[42:48.25]Let's go.
[42:49.49]What?
[42:50.15]Where am I supposed to go?
[42:51.87]We already walked by.
[42:52.77]You already did that effect.
[42:55.51]I just walked in a circle.
[42:59.71]Left, left, left, right, up.
[43:01.74]Left.
[43:03.44]Does that person have the correct thing?
[43:10.52]By the way, a firefighter, you'd never be able to be in here for this long.
[43:16.56]Watch out for the stove.
[43:22.28]Shut it off.
[43:24.74]Alright.
[43:25.04]Maybe.
[43:26.28]Shut it off.
[43:26.80]Maybe.
[43:28.07]Oh my fucking god.
[43:33.05]Like... The thing that has thrown me off the most is when you spin around in a circle and the left, right, and straight doesn't mean anything.
[43:42.57]Force.
[43:42.87]What do you mean force?
[43:46.28]Did I do it right?
[43:46.86]I just grabbed the handle and it worked.
[43:50.56]Left?
[43:50.86]I don't fucking know.
[43:53.90]Left?
[43:59.01]Oh, you got the girl out.
[44:00.77]Wasn't there like seven people in that house?
[44:21.55]Alright, who has it?
[44:28.74]Post it.
[44:29.94]Paste it.
[44:34.44]What do I do?
[44:36.38]No, I'm not done.
[44:37.86]I want to beat this.
[44:38.46]I want to cheat and beat this.
[44:39.96]Who's got the fucking right combination?
[44:43.64]Alright, at least we unplugged the TV.
[44:47.22]Post it up.
[44:47.76]Paste it up.
[44:51.03]It's just a guessing game, but we ain't gonna guess.
[44:52.57]We're gonna get right to the fucking nitty gritty.
[44:54.93]You know what I mean?
[44:59.21]Has this guy got it?
[45:00.16]I think somebody's got it.
[45:01.16]Somebody's got it in the chat.
[45:03.74]We're gonna try this.
[45:04.94]This is a random person in chat.
[45:08.64]No, that's not right.
[45:11.98]It says it on screen?
[45:14.03]No, it doesn't.
[45:18.13]You guys are all spamming this one, so we're gonna try this one.
[45:25.66]left left left left right I don't know if this is real but this is what everybody's spamming it might it has to be real if everybody in chat is spamming the same thing here we go left left left alright left
[45:51.76]I still don't understand this.
[45:52.92]Left.
[45:53.16]I think this... Yes, yes, get rid of it.
[45:54.50]Get rid of that.
[45:55.44]Left again.
[45:56.04]Left again.
[46:21.55]I got plenty of air.
[46:23.49]Left again.
[46:25.63]Remember, we got this cutscene.
[46:30.89]There's just one more left after this.
[46:32.28]Left.
[46:33.06]There it is.
[46:34.20]And then right.
[46:48.78]Wow, this person wasn't a liar.
[46:54.48]Right again?
[46:59.37]Well, I think Twitch chat didn't lie to me for once.
[47:01.23]Left?
[47:01.73]There's no left.
[47:02.67]There's no left.
[47:03.37]I'm in deep shit.
[47:15.85]What about that thing?
[47:17.27]Iron?
[47:17.61]Uh-oh.
[47:28.73]We just walked around in a circle.
[47:32.12]There's no more... Where's that fucking thing, the stove, to turn off?
[47:39.28]We go through the Universal Studios ride.
[47:44.48]It was a cat.
[47:45.44]Alright, we got the cat.
[47:46.20]Saved at least one member of the family.
[47:48.30]Alright, now where is... What package?
[47:50.84]What the fuck was that?
[47:52.91]That didn't happen last time.
[48:12.48]Why did the fucking roof- Why did the room explode up there?
[48:21.44]You guys are halfway through your tanks.
[48:25.90]The whole house- Oh, fucking god.
[48:32.20]I'm cheap.
[48:33.40]I'm gonna get it myself.
[48:37.65]I'll get it myself.
[48:40.87]Shit, this game- I forgot this is not like- this game like is stupid and sucks.
[48:48.51]SEGA CD Fahrenheit.
[48:49.59]Oh god.
[48:55.55]This is- this is not gonna work.
[49:05.99]Somebody- somebody almost had it too.
[49:07.85]I'm so disappointed.
[49:15.19]Would anyone ever sit through this and make a guide?
[49:16.97]I don't know.
[49:19.25]Probably not.
[49:20.25]But somebody had to.
[49:21.21]Here's a floor plan of the house.
[49:31.01]Really?
[49:31.65]Well, like, alright, floor plan of the house.
[49:33.67]Wait, can I put it on easy?
[49:36.95]Wait a minute.
[49:40.92]I think I can put this shit on easy.
[49:42.97]You better believe I'm going to put it on easy.
[49:45.21]Oh my god.
[49:46.40]Easy.
[49:50.00]Games on easy.
[49:54.00]Now it's like impossible to lose, right?
[49:55.20]Shut up.
[49:58.64]There we go.
[50:10.87]Okay, you are moving to the foyer on the first floor.
[50:13.62]We'll be in your ear, kid.
[50:15.90]Listen up.
[50:18.90]Let's go.
[50:27.05]You're on the den.
[50:27.83]Do it.
[50:32.51]I swear if you lose... I have to get rid of the hazards.
[50:38.11]One of them's kerosene, the other one's the gas stove, and you have to guess which fucking valve to turn on.
[50:43.08]I can't even get back over to the valve, because the whole game is red.
[50:48.42]Last attempt, and then we're going to the next one.
[50:52.02]Get rid of it.
[50:52.42]Get rid of it.
[50:59.05]Okay.
[51:00.29]Let's go.
[51:03.12]Good going, but you better move fast.
[51:05.28]I got a nervous family out here.
[51:06.78]You do have a nervous family.
[51:08.40]That's fine.
[51:09.52]Uh, let's just go.
[51:11.26]Let's get out of here.
[51:15.25]I gotta go, like, up the stairs.
[51:18.91]Okay, this room's a goner.
[51:20.49]Shut up.
[51:23.13]Get me the stairs.
[51:29.13]Where's the staircase?
[51:30.35]Look over to the left, please.
[51:34.71]I wouldn't do that.
[51:35.33]What are you talking about?
[51:40.71]Your incompetence is going to get someone killed.
[51:42.96]What happened?
[51:43.42]It's a damn good thing Stinky was using his head.
[51:46.20]Did I walk out of the house?
[51:47.18]You're going to have to move a little faster if you ever hope to get the girl.
[51:52.86]You alright, honey?
[51:53.76]Hold on, that was on easy.
[51:55.00]I got like 19 seconds to beat the game.
[52:02.70]Save button?
[52:03.44]No.
[52:04.18]I don't fucking care.
[52:05.16]We'll be here all night.
[52:07.04]It's going fucking straight into the house.
[52:11.45]Good sense of direction.
[52:12.47]Okay, let's go ahead and just fucking look at the fucking screen.
[52:17.65]Sense of direction, dude.
[52:20.33]Somebody right now, this is what would happen if somebody put a fucking plastic bag over your head and started killing you and then moved you around in a circle like pinning the tail of a donkey and squeezed your eyes.
[52:32.50]You're going to be able to find something?
[52:33.66]A lot of nice stuff in here.
[52:38.72]Too bad we didn't catch it earlier.
[52:40.26]This is that fucking, like, this is that, like, 112P right now.
[52:44.21]I hate electrical fires.
[52:52.07]Oh, by the way, I've been looking in chat.
[52:53.59]I haven't been paying attention to the game at all.
[52:55.87]Rookie, check your breathing.
[52:57.23]You don't want to use up all your air.
[52:59.82]Where's that, like, fucking... God.
[53:03.19]Where's the fucking staircase?
[53:05.93]Get me a... Dude, and you want to wear, like, FOV?
[53:09.85]The FOV is just this, like, straight ahead.
[53:11.99]Oh my fucking god.
[53:13.99]I gotta get the fuck out of this game.
[53:16.69]I'm gonna... I'm gonna throw up if I play this game for another five fucking seconds.
[53:22.98]Where's the stairs?
[53:24.60]Everything's black and red.
[53:26.52]Do you guys see a staircase?
[53:33.66]Give me just give me the stairs.
[53:37.84]I found them before When I said this gave my I think I found the stairs they're over here right I Don't know what that is that looked like an ice cream sandwich.
[53:50.48]I don't fucking know that could have been a staircase No, that was that was that was a fucking just big like velvet cheesecake No, we're back in here back in this fucking room
[54:04.60]Okay.
[54:04.86]Should we take it?
[54:05.66]No, fuck you.
[54:07.06]Leave it.
[54:07.60]Okay, there's this.
[54:08.49]Now we go left?
[54:10.51]No, I can't go left.
[54:11.55]Give me the fucking stairs.
[54:32.42]No, how about you send in somebody that doesn't have, like, 1-6 vision?
[54:38.08]That would be good.
[54:38.64]Dude, how do I get the fuck out?
[54:46.96]There's, like, these three rooms.
[54:48.40]There's no other rooms in this house.
[54:52.83]Where else am I supposed to go?
[54:56.63]There's no, like... I'm walking into the fucking fire and I'm turning the game off.
[55:05.32]It's off.
[55:10.64]And hey, guess what?
[55:13.66]It's across the fucking room now.
[55:15.24]That game sucks.
[55:20.12]No wonder that fucking company went under.
[55:29.45]That's the kind of... Okay, if I put my hands around your neck and squeezed...
[55:34.81]And like the world started closing in.
[55:37.41]And like, I got to the point where like, you do that to me right before I die.
[55:40.33]Like I'm about, I'm dying.
[55:41.61]You're choking me to death.
[55:42.89]I'm about to be dead.
[55:44.51]And then you slap me in the face three times and throw me into a burning building and put drunk goggles on me.
[55:52.00]It's like, go find a fucking family in there.
[55:58.16]I don't know what this one is.
[55:59.28]This one's going to be fucking the worst.
[56:01.74]You know, the one that might be the worst could be the best.
[56:17.71]Here we go.
[56:20.69]What's this one called?
[56:22.45]Hidden Valley Ranch?
[56:26.24]I think this is Hidden Valley Ranch.
[56:29.82]Monsters of a Hidden, what the fuck is this?
[56:33.78]This game is, this one's gonna fucking suck.
[56:39.05]to be so bad.
[56:40.47]Is it even going to work?
[56:42.61]Come on.
[56:46.57]Come on.
[56:48.88]Pull it together here SEGA CD.
[56:50.14]What the fuck is this?
[56:55.90]I don't think I don't think this one works.
[57:03.06]I think this one might be a little too scuffed up in the scuff department.
[57:10.44]Let's try it.
[57:10.82]Let's try reloading.
[57:11.56]Let me take it out and blow on it.
[57:23.34]Alright.
[57:23.58]Let's like scuff it up a little bit to get it back in there.
[57:27.85]Here we go.
[57:34.51]It says it can start.
[57:35.29]I mean, I had a problem with another one too.
[57:40.69]These old CDs.
[57:42.92]Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't.
[57:51.62]I don't think so.
[57:56.00]Alright.
[57:56.94]Well, that was a bust.
[57:58.52]We'll go back to another one.
[57:59.42]We're going to do another one.
[58:01.02]That's sad.
[58:03.12]Oh, well.
[58:05.38]Wait, wait a minute.
[58:07.98]I just saw life.
[58:08.74]Oh!
[58:10.76]Wow, I was about to, I was going to hit the button.
[58:14.59]We're good.
[58:14.91]I was about to turn the fucking thing.
[58:22.13]What?
[58:26.73]I already did this shit.
[58:28.50]Data storage, built-in memory, please format.
[58:30.42]The cartridge memory is not printed.
[58:31.44]Yeah, format.
[58:33.24]So do it.
[58:33.92]Format.
[58:34.44]Yes.
[58:35.72]Format complete.
[58:36.92]Okay.
[58:38.30]Let's go.
[58:40.81]Let's do it.
[58:44.47]I did this before I turned the stream on.
[58:50.15]Come on.
[58:55.19]Come on.
[58:55.43]There we go, you bag of shit console.
[59:00.37]There you go, you fucking console that got like 900 people laid off.
[59:07.16]That's fucking mean.
[59:11.99]By the way, this is absolutely going to be the worst game.
[59:13.65]By far.
[59:13.91]No way!
[59:37.03]We better go home or we'll be in big trouble.
[59:40.35]Besides, Grandma told us never to go anywhere near the elm tree.
[59:44.27]People better stop dying.
[59:45.08]Remember she said that there's ghosts there and that they turn us into butterflies if we stared at one long enough, especially during a full moon.
[59:53.90]You said there was no such thing as ghosts.
[59:57.56]Besides, I think it would be fun to be a butterfly.
[60:02.99]Hey, wait!
[60:04.29]No!
[60:05.77]I thought she was, like, stabbing him.
[60:07.65]I thought she was, like, stabbing him with a knife.
[60:10.47]Did you hear that?
[60:11.07]It was like... That was, like, psycho.
[60:23.64]That was, like, her creepy, like, we all die speech.
[60:29.42]Holy shit, this is bad.
[60:32.44]Jesus Christ.
[60:36.58]Was this game made in 3D Movie Maker?
[60:42.63]I promise you this is like... Frame rate is ideal here.
[60:49.89]There it is.
[60:51.82]There's the mansion.
[61:02.00]Imagine the hidden souls.
[61:05.76]Press the start button if you're ready.
[61:07.66]Okay, I pressed start.
[61:15.91]I'm not going to do that again, right?
[61:22.67]Yeah.
[61:26.83]Okay.
[61:27.51]Logo twice.
[61:32.05]Okay.
[61:36.60]Alright.
[61:42.04]You doing alright over there?
[61:46.66]Are you okay?
[61:53.89]Yes.
[61:54.49]I do know the company that made the game.
[61:56.47]The company that worked on this.
[61:57.43]I do.
[61:59.13]This is the game.
[62:11.12]No.
[62:12.14]No.
[62:21.11]No.
[62:23.17]No.
[62:24.85]No.
[62:25.11]Skip!
[62:27.08]I know!
[62:27.86]SEGA made the game.
[62:28.88]Let's go ahead and move on from this.
[62:30.62]Go back to the mansion.
[62:31.68]There was a fucking scary mansion that was there.
[62:36.52]There's no game.
[62:41.58]Okay.
[62:47.48]Okay, well, there they go.
[62:50.34]You can't get past the fucking intro.
[62:56.39]Look, a butterfly.
[63:05.37]Wow.
[63:05.75]Wow.
[63:09.04]One more time.
[63:09.54]Come on.
[63:10.76]I'm gonna open the fucking CD tray.
[63:13.72]CD tray, open.
[63:16.68]Opened up the CD tray.
[63:18.32]You never do that.
[63:18.88]Don't ever do that on your fucking console.
[63:20.62]Just did it.
[63:21.24]Close CD tray.
[63:23.90]Oh, shit.
[63:24.70]I broke it.
[63:25.06]No, I didn't.
[63:26.24]Oh, fuck.
[63:26.62]I think I did.
[63:27.63]I did it with my fucking foot.
[63:28.61]Why am I doing this with my foot?
[63:30.57]Use your hand.
[63:33.83]Okay.
[63:36.51]Here we go.
[63:42.95]Come on.
[63:44.87]It's reading the disk right now.
[63:47.76]Clean the disk.
[63:48.38]I already did all of them.
[63:52.44]It's working.
[63:55.10]It's still working.
[64:01.43]It's trying.
[64:02.45]God damn it.
[64:04.45]Why would they fucking tease us like that?
[64:07.55]I'm going to reset.
[64:09.37]Come on.
[64:14.64]I really want to know what this game's about too.
[64:17.73]That was such a tease.
[64:18.81]It showed us this wicked stupid opening cutscene and then we couldn't even play the game.
[64:27.68]Last attempt.
[64:28.92]We're just going to go right to it.
[64:30.14]We got the SEGA logo again.
[64:37.86]There we go.
[64:38.56]Start.
[64:39.06]New game.
[64:39.94]Got it.
[64:41.86]All it took was my fucking dirty foot to touch it.
[64:44.39]We're good.
[64:47.23]Where am I?
[64:49.57]How can this be?
[64:50.61]There was no mansion here before.
[64:55.17]Okay.
[64:55.39]Shit, this is ugly.
[64:58.73]Jonathan!
[64:58.91]Over here!
[64:59.21]Quick, I'm over here!
[65:09.19]This is Resident Evil.
[65:11.71]This is just the resi- the beginning of Resident Evil 1 with the clock too.
[65:16.68]It's the same fucking exact game.
[65:20.38]When is Wesker gonna come put like a bullet in the back of my head?
[65:27.46]It's the same!
[65:28.08]It's the same!
[65:28.66]It's the game!
[65:29.78]It's Resident Evil.
[65:31.48]The same door.
[65:35.60]It actually is Resident Evil.
[65:37.88]They fucking ripped the whole thing off.
[65:39.02]What came out first?
[65:40.74]Just... Everybody stop.
[65:43.84]Stop for a minute.
[65:44.50]Everybody stop moving.
[65:45.92]Whatever you're doing, put your fucking hands up.
[65:47.34]Put your hands in the air.
[65:47.86]Don't touch your fucking keyboard.
[65:54.90]Nobody move.
[66:11.28]I need to see it.
[66:11.84]I need to see a reference photo.
[66:16.60]Yeah, it's the same.
[66:19.80]This is the fucking exact same game.
[66:25.49]Pull up a reference.
[66:31.43]I'm like actually fucking scared of this game now.
[66:33.07]Here, you wanna see?
[66:36.11]Look at this.
[66:38.07]I gotta like download the image first.
[66:46.41]Even the clock, too.
[66:51.99]Let's, like, go in real time.
[66:53.35]Here.
[66:55.97]Resident Evil Mansion.
[67:04.54]This is, like, the updated version.
[67:05.60]Where'd the one go that I just had?
[67:12.90]There it is.
[67:16.51]Okay, look at this.
[67:25.74]I can't put it on screen for some reason.
[67:34.89]I can't put it on screen.
[67:37.61]Maybe I can.
[67:38.11]Here.
[67:44.13]No, it's, like, all fucked up.
[67:45.43]Never mind.
[67:46.29]My OBS is, like, gonna crash if I try to do this.
[67:48.29]Let's just go.
[67:54.18]I just, like, tried to do it.
[67:55.10]I just pushed my face through the door and it didn't work.
[68:08.73]It does look the same.
[68:09.67]It does.
[68:09.97]I, like, I just can't... I have to, like, dial... Oh, hold on.
[68:13.65]I can't do two things at once.
[68:20.75]Here we go.
[68:21.59]There we go.
[68:21.91]I got it.
[68:28.49]There it is.
[68:31.13]Take a look at that.
[68:31.57]It's exactly the fucking same.
[68:35.63]Let's go look at it from the front.
[68:42.83]Look at that.
[68:45.06]Exact same fucking video game.
[68:47.38]No differences at all.
[68:52.04]Look at that.
[69:05.85]Fucking ridiculous.
[69:11.78]They both have stairs.
[69:12.81]They're the same.
[69:14.19]It is the fucking same.
[69:18.27]It's the same.
[69:18.93]Speaking of the same, let's make this a little bigger for you guys.
[69:25.89]Let's get it real cinematic.
[69:34.22]There we go.
[69:39.06]They both look like generic men.
[69:40.42]It's Resident Evil 1.
[69:41.12]There's gonna be zombies in this game.
[69:42.82]Just wait.
[69:44.56]You'll all see.
[69:45.06]Did I just go in the fucking fireplace?
[70:04.84]What the hell was that?
[70:12.32]Somebody was just, like, calling my name.
[70:14.62]Let's turn around.
[70:15.40]Let's go back the other way.
[70:27.13]Is this one of those just point-and-click adventure games?
[70:29.59]Where is somebody gonna grab me and scream in my face?
[70:31.41]Give me, like, a key for this.
[70:35.91]And don't open it.
[70:38.84]I really do enjoy the PlayStation UI sounds, though.
[70:43.97]When you go in and out.
[70:48.95]This is fucking Resident Evil.
[70:50.00]I don't care what anybody says.
[70:52.92]PlayStation 1, Resident Evil.
[70:54.86]Got the exact same vibe, the same clock.
[70:57.28]Same doors, the same colors.
[71:00.44]Same graphics engine.
[71:08.52]Oh, that's not how doors work.
[71:09.60]I hit my face.
[71:11.56]What is going on?
[71:14.51]Go up the stairs.
[71:18.05]Same fucking console.
[71:19.09]Same name.
[71:21.73]Mansion of Hidden Souls.
[71:22.85]That's Resident Evil.
[71:31.30]Where are the actors?
[71:31.94]Got a fucking picture of Yoda.
[71:35.26]Pretty good.
[71:42.47]This one doesn't have a handle.
[71:45.37]Only one of these doors can be opened.
[71:51.38]What's this over here?
[71:51.92]Another door?
[71:52.90]This one's got a handle.
[71:53.74]We can open this one.
[71:55.18]Watch this.
[71:58.22]Alright, who's in here?
[71:58.88]Plane, pull.
[72:00.10]Person?
[72:00.60]It's the butterfly.
[72:01.62]Oh my god.
[72:15.42]The butterfly is talking.
[72:16.56]Vampires are supposed to be bats, not butterflies.
[72:22.51]This sucks.
[72:23.09]This is not intimidating.
[72:23.79]Especially that awful, awful accent.
[72:43.50]Oh, your brother is here.
[72:45.14]That sounds like, uh... What are you, like one of those sand snakes?
[72:48.94]What beautiful flowers.
[72:49.80]There's so many of them.
[72:54.66]You dare talk to my brother that way?
[72:59.76]Did you hear that?
[73:01.39]That was the voice of your sister.
[73:03.93]You want to see her?
[73:07.67]I don't think so.
[73:08.63]Oh, it's a scary butterfly.
[73:09.99]It's bright and blue.
[73:19.17]This is bad.
[73:20.35]But we're not done.
[73:20.99]We're gonna play darts.
[73:24.31]No, we're not.
[73:27.96]By the way, buttons don't do anything.
[73:29.78]You just walk around.
[73:36.54]Let me tell you something about where you are.
[73:38.70]You're in my mansion.
[73:39.68]I'm dead.
[73:40.22]I'm long gone.
[73:41.10]But my brother owns the place.
[73:45.26]You must challenge him to a game of pool.
[73:48.25]And if you lose, your soul is mine forever.
[73:55.45]Get me the fuck out of here.
[73:58.31]Should I take a pool cue?
[74:01.41]There's no minuses on that one.
[74:05.75]I can't leave.
[74:06.31]Oh my god.
[74:09.48]I can make a better game than this.
[74:14.42]In fact, I will.
[74:16.02]I will make a better game than this.
[74:25.41]My goal at this point is I want to make an FMV game.
[74:28.11]I want to make a game like this.
[74:29.57]I do.
[74:30.49]Badly.
[74:33.05]What is this?
[74:33.41]Some kind of TV screen?
[74:39.31]No.
[74:40.81]Just show me a red door.
[74:47.28]I can't leave this until I figure out the fucking dumb puzzle.
[74:50.59]But what is the puzzle?
[74:52.07]Is there a puzzle?
[74:53.97]No, I think it's just go in door.
[74:56.67]Yeah, it's just go out of door.
[75:03.87]That's a closet.
[75:04.59]That is not a closet.
[75:05.42]Alright, this door now has a handle.
[75:10.62]Can I go in it?
[75:11.96]No.
[75:16.34]Jeremy, can you change games?
[75:17.70]Not yet.
[75:19.22]We have to get to the first big scare, and then I'm going to change games.
[75:23.80]You guys aren't going to like the one that's coming up next.
[75:26.59]I can guarantee you that.
[75:29.01]This room is elaborate.
[75:33.77]This is like some Alice in Wonderland shit.
[75:42.24]This room hurts to look at.
[75:47.70]There's the closet, right?
[75:48.48]No, I... Can something happen, please?
[75:56.85]Ugh!
[75:58.63]What?
[76:05.29]It's a different butterfly.
[76:06.17]That's not the same one.
[76:07.99]That's not the evil butterfly.
[76:09.18]That's fucking Glinda the Good Witch.
[76:12.36]Alright.
[76:14.60]Alright.
[76:18.43]There's the thing that I saw.
[76:19.51]We have to go in here.
[76:21.95]Go in there.
[76:22.31]I found the magic key.
[76:30.84]It was under the fucking rug.
[76:37.93]You weren't trying to hide it very well.
[76:40.65]How could I find the key that was just under a rug?
[76:45.70]Shocking.
[76:48.12]Get me out of this room.
[76:48.90]I kind of want to leave this game, but I can't.
[76:54.77]I can't do it.
[76:55.75]I need to see what happens.
[76:57.41]This game was like $20.
[76:58.27]I had to spend... How much was this?
[77:00.69]The fucking price is on it.
[77:02.92]No, it's not.
[77:03.26]I ripped it off.
[77:04.62]Why did I rip it off?
[77:12.38]Oh, fuck.
[77:12.88]This is rated G.
[77:17.52]This game is rated G. Ain't gonna be no blood in this game.
[77:22.57]There's no violence in this game, guys.
[77:24.17]Sorry, it's a Disney game.
[77:27.22]There's nothing in this game.
[77:28.16]Let's just walk around the house.
[77:30.88]Oh, fuck.
[77:31.38]Somebody just gave a lot of money.
[77:37.18]J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-
[78:01.62]And a guy that's like... He's the crazy guy that's like in the darkest... Most troubling times will come!
[78:10.16]That was like one of my favorite games as a kid.
[78:11.40]Are you kidding me?
[78:15.13]Do I sense a guest?
[78:17.09]Oh, my fucking God.
[78:19.15]I hate this game.
[78:22.55]But thank you for the hundred bucks.
[78:23.73]You also gave money earlier, too.
[78:24.81]Let me just take a quick look.
[78:27.07]What a surprise!
[78:28.83]Why are you here?
[78:30.23]Do you want to be...
[78:32.04]Fuck up.
[78:37.60]You're not going to like this one.
[78:43.45]You're not going to like this one.
[78:50.60]I'm telling you right now, no one's going to like this one.
[78:59.30]I don't even know why I have this.
[79:00.80]I don't know why I bought this.
[79:01.98]I don't even want to play it.
[79:05.14]I haven't played it yet, but fuck it.
[79:06.50]It's stupid.
[79:07.11]Thank you so much, though, dude.
[79:10.07]I could play Zumbiniville.
[79:14.03]Maybe I'll do that soon.
[79:15.67]I forget how fun that game was.
[79:20.04]Ugh.
[79:22.72]No one's going to think this is funny.
[79:24.06]It's just a fucking shitty game.
[79:30.84]Mostly lost thanks to the $5... $10, actually.
[79:32.50]The game is an AVADCARD masterpiece.
[79:37.99]Endless intro is a commentary on how those substance games had gotten back in the 1960s when the game was made.
[80:00.68]It's a fucking SteelSeries.
[80:02.38]Did you see that SteelSeries logo?
[80:08.30]It's not a trap game.
[80:12.68]It's another make-my-video game, except it's not Marky Mark.
[80:20.87]Don't worry, we're not gonna be on this one long.
[80:22.81]We're just gonna skip... This is not where... We're just... Not a...
[80:35.59]What?
[80:37.23]Did I just lose the game?
[80:38.19]Am I not allowed to play the game?
[80:48.14]What game am I allowed to play?
[80:49.34]Oh, fucking N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-
[81:07.26]We now use, we now do Lowe's and Home Depot hardware.
[81:12.28]Now that is Phil Lamarr, yes.
[81:22.62]I skipped it.
[81:23.42]That is Phil Lamarr.
[81:29.94]This is my, I'm gonna go in here.
[81:31.80]Let me get in here.
[81:32.66]Go in.
[81:34.82]How do I play this game?
[81:38.39]Why can't I do anything?
[81:40.13]Why is that guy just the fucking eagle from the Muppets equivalency?
[81:47.74]That's just the eagle.
[81:48.42]Now, could we just tell it like it is, please?
[82:00.72]No, no, no, my brother.
[82:01.70]I disagree.
[82:03.04]I mean, hey.
[82:05.42]He has a knife in his back.
[82:07.54]That guy has a fucking knife in his back.
[82:09.36]What?
[82:10.12]Go ahead.
[82:11.20]Make my video.
[82:12.08]And make it a sharp cut.
[82:15.75]That guy has a sword in his fucking back.
[82:22.69]What do I do?
[82:23.17]Okay.
[82:33.89]I already know.
[82:34.37]I already know.
[82:34.84]I already know.
[82:38.00]I already know how this game goes.
[82:43.72]We've already played this.
[82:45.10]It's the same game, but just not Marky Mark.
[82:47.02]Yeah.
[82:49.15]Off.
[82:49.23]Okay.
[82:49.33]Things that make you go off.
[83:03.53]Alright, what do we got here?
[83:05.62]Oh, by the way, I... Oh!
[83:07.34]Ooh!
[83:09.40]Ooh!
[83:10.88]Okay, that's not what I wanted to do.
[83:13.84]Okay.
[83:15.36]It's fine.
[83:15.82]Everything's fine.
[83:18.27]So, I wanted to, uh... God, there... There are discs everywhere in this room.
[83:27.03]That wasn't a good sound.
[83:27.95]No.
[83:28.33]It's okay.
[83:28.57]Okay, so we didnt a good sound.
[83:29.35]No.
[83:29.41]It's okay.
[83:29.61]But we're... Okay, so we're gonna go back...
[83:32.02]We're going to go back to a game we played yesterday because I figured out how to actually play it.
[83:36.01]Okay?
[83:40.21]We're going to go back to double switch.
[83:44.87]I know how to play it now.
[83:46.63]We're going to do this.
[83:48.01]Then we're going to move on.
[83:49.53]Don't worry.
[83:53.42]We aren't done.
[83:58.38]There's plenty more.
[84:01.94]Wirehead.
[84:02.36]We already beat Wirehead.
[84:03.28]We beat Wirehead yesterday on stream.
[84:11.73]I will, eventually.
[84:15.83]Dr. Fudge also gave bits too.
[84:17.08]Thank you, Dr. Fudge.
[84:20.64]Obviously the JKF is $120 almost now.
[84:25.54]Super Rich Spaghetti with the $50 earlier.
[84:28.94]Curly Snail.
[84:29.52]Thanks for the two bucks.
[84:30.98]Am I going to play Earthworm Jim?
[84:32.17]No, the games that were on other consoles, like for instance, like Sonic, Earthworm Jim, the Mickey Mouse games and shit.
[84:42.73]You can play those on like Super Nintendo.
[84:45.10]I wanted to get shit that you could only play on SEGA CD or like 3DO.
[84:49.98]And all of them.
[84:52.30]Wirehead was really the only game that held.
[84:54.34]Fahrenheit was kind of cool for me.
[84:58.01]I can't think of any other game that was good.
[85:02.59]But I know how to do this now.
[85:05.07]I figured it out.
[85:06.07]Hey.
[85:08.95]Hi.
[85:10.57]My name is Eddie.
[85:11.71]We can skip this, don't worry.
[85:13.43]This is my building.
[85:15.03]And since the neighborhood really sucks, I built all these security systems to protect the people who live here.
[85:22.27]The problem is some bonehead... Alright, like, fuck this guy.
[85:26.01]There we go.
[85:28.79]So I know how to play this now.
[85:31.07]She's not gonna scream this time.
[85:33.45]You have to get it primed, and then when they step in the right spot, you gotta trap them.
[85:44.00]Like this.
[85:50.32]You gotta just drop, you gotta find the right point to do it.
[85:54.62]I think she said something, but who cares.
[85:58.96]I didn't get it.
[86:01.92]This guy's safe.
[86:06.88]Gotta go up here.
[86:07.40]Alright, the Tito or coffin?
[86:11.61]No, that guy's gone too.
[86:12.71]Okay, well, we fucked it up.
[86:14.91]Fan or column?
[86:15.77]Column.
[86:16.05]No, guy in here.
[86:28.55]Yellow means that somebody's there.
[86:32.86]Maybe he's going to step on something and throw him out the window?
[86:38.12]No.
[86:38.22]Okay.
[86:38.88]Down here.
[86:41.35]Punch or power box?
[86:43.01]Power box.
[86:44.55]You think you're going to, like, touch the power?
[86:47.71]Nope.
[86:47.99]See you later.
[86:50.33]Trapper.
[86:55.34]Protect the statue.
[86:56.26]This is where the band is playing.
[87:01.26]For some reason, the band is up here.
[87:02.56]Alright, punch or coffin?
[87:03.56]I don't know.
[87:05.42]I didn't get it.
[87:06.18]Fuck.
[87:08.60]That might have been punch.
[87:12.85]This is Five Nights at Freddy's.
[87:14.09]Call him or fan?
[87:15.69]Fuck.
[87:16.37]God damn it.
[87:17.01]I hate this.
[87:19.17]Somebody's currently putting their car alarm on.
[87:24.67]065?
[87:24.71]Let's get this guy.
[87:28.61]Got him.
[87:29.79]Get sent to the fucking morgue, buddy.
[87:32.51]Over here.
[87:36.31]Fireplace or window?
[87:37.17]Window?
[87:38.97]No, he's gone.
[87:39.97]This guy.
[87:41.61]Lamp?
[87:42.95]Lamp?
[87:43.65]Got him.
[87:54.24]This game is fucking stupid.
[87:57.02]I love how we tried so long to try to figure this game out, and now I figured it out, and the game is fucking shitty.
[88:01.95]Fan or column?
[88:03.75]Column?
[88:06.09]I don't understand.
[88:08.57]Uh...
[88:21.74]Is that money?
[88:23.96]I think I'm going to have to drop something on his head.
[88:31.71]No, I lose.
[88:33.13]Can you imagine being this laser district company?
[88:39.46]Okay, thanks for the tip.
[88:42.46]I got this guy right now.
[88:43.54]He's going to walk by the column, and I'm going to drop it on his head.
[88:45.62]Come on.
[88:49.40]Here he goes.
[88:54.12]Got him.
[88:59.56]I love how nobody fucking cares and that guy just died.
[89:01.86]What do we do?
[89:06.99]This guy got out.
[89:08.13]Fuck.
[89:10.75]I think I lose.
[89:14.93]Power box.
[89:15.43]Alright, this guy's going for the power box.
[89:18.19]What?
[89:18.75]Let me get... I understand.
[89:19.91]I know.
[89:20.77]Yeah, there's a guy... You just fucked it all up, dude.
[89:27.15]Thanks a lot.
[89:30.38]Fireplace.
[89:35.86]He avoided the fireplace.
[89:38.14]God damn it!
[89:43.04]Got him.
[89:44.52]That guy's dead.
[89:45.80]You don't come back from that.
[89:49.50]Mommy?
[89:50.00]Got him.
[89:51.20]Is this the same fucking person?
[89:54.54]I don't understand this.
[89:56.62]Coffin?
[89:57.99]Or the tiptoe?
[89:58.95]I don't know.
[90:01.07]I think he got out.
[90:06.15]I don't know.
[90:06.43]I don't even know what it was.
[90:07.89]No idea.
[90:09.09]Guy up here.
[90:11.96]Mommy?
[90:14.40]No, lamp.
[90:23.15]Really?
[90:25.51]Okay.
[90:31.49]Well, she's dead.
[90:33.07]Got her.
[90:34.19]You let those suckers get to the power box.
[90:38.69]And now we're all cut off.
[90:42.34]Well, there you go.
[90:43.04]There's double switch.
[90:44.44]I got the high score.
[90:51.54]Done.
[90:53.04]Where do I stand?
[90:56.44]Game over.
[90:56.84]Alright, let's move on.
[91:02.38]Is that game on iPad?
[91:05.44]Are you serious?
[91:06.06]Okay.
[91:09.74]Give me a moment.
[91:13.16]I'm going to go pee and set up the next thing.
[91:16.14]I'll be right back.
[91:17.17]Don't go anywhere.
[91:18.07]We still have a few things to do.
[91:20.21]Don't go anywhere.
[91:21.39]I'll be right back.
[94:43.48]Okay.
[94:44.90]Hi, everybody.
[94:46.62]Shall we continue?
[94:48.28]I think we shall.
[94:51.00]Cover your eyes.
[94:52.24]Because this is... This is going to hurt your eyes if you look at this for too long.
[94:58.70]We're going to jump into this one.
[95:00.18]I want to play this one bad.
[95:02.18]But... Hold on.
[95:04.98]What the fuck is going on here?
[95:11.30]My computer crashed.
[95:14.98]Okay, no, no, no, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[95:17.42]Okay, I thought my computer crashed.
[95:20.93]Let me plug my headphones in.
[95:22.65]I just ran, I just ran over all the disks again, but that's alright.
[95:28.99]Thanks to Mostly Lost for the bits.
[95:31.17]I don't think I said, no, no, I said, I did, I did.
[95:33.63]Sometimes I fucking, sometimes I fuck up, you know what I mean?
[95:36.67]Let's get the window capture here.
[95:38.23]Hey, look at that!
[95:41.47]Look at all those bits!
[95:45.34]There it is.
[95:45.92]Hey, hey, do you guys want like, you guys want to like fucking get like your brains purged?
[95:54.87]You ready for the ring lady to shoot out of this?
[95:58.47]Have fun.
[95:59.23]Alright, give me a second.
[96:02.95]Turn that off.
[96:04.06]Put this up here.
[96:04.78]And let me load this.
[96:14.73]Okay.
[96:16.23]And here we go.
[96:22.37]We have liftoff.
[96:26.78]The SEGA CD.
[96:29.26]Here comes the next one.
[96:30.20]It's so loud.
[96:31.22]Alright.
[96:34.27]This one's called like fucking Who Framed Roger Rabbit or some shit.
[96:36.97]I don't know.
[96:37.99]You'll see in a minute.
[96:47.90]Okay, for a second I thought I was already dead.
[96:56.54]Should crack open a fucking crab.
[97:02.99]This is unbearable, by the way.
[97:04.67]I can't even see anything.
[97:06.23]Who shot Roger Rabbit?
[97:08.79]I never was very lucky until I met Johnny Rock.
[97:12.17]And now someone's even taking him away from me.
[97:14.85]This is so fucking bad, holy shit.
[97:16.51]Cops closed the file on this one, and that's why I need you.
[97:20.55]I know it was one of the four diseases, but let the hammer down on my man.
[97:27.02]Mumps is the name.
[97:28.00]Whatever.
[97:28.94]Johnny Rock?
[97:30.18]He was a bum.
[97:31.48]Two-timer.
[97:32.00]A double-crosser.
[97:33.86]He was a double-crosser.
[97:36.64]Hey, this is the equivalent of the Game Boy Color by the way.
[97:39.80]Remember that fucking console?
[97:42.82]Yeah, he was an acquaintance.
[97:45.51]He had a soft spot for horses and Hudson's.
[97:48.47]I thought he said whores.
[97:49.97]He had a soft spot for horses.
[97:53.65]And he placed a few bets in my book, but I didn't shoot him.
[97:58.10]I pack a pencil, not a piece.
[98:02.98]Somebody wasted a lot of bullets, and you'll have to too.
[98:07.30]Oh, there's lots of heat.
[98:09.10]Gangsters, explosions, ambushes, and a mystery to boot.
[98:13.52]Not to mention Murderer's Row.
[98:15.08]Knitted pillow.
[98:17.92]And there's even a bad girl.
[98:19.49]Oh, oh no, not me.
[98:21.51]It's like my nana's knitted pillow, but moving.
[98:25.27]Oh, sweet talk Johnny Rock.
[98:28.07]Sure he used to sing here?
[98:29.99]I was gonna make him a star.
[98:32.23]Why would I do him in?
[98:34.81]Do I look like I'm hurting?
[98:37.61]Maybe it was that weasel- Oh, is that roulette?
[98:40.06]Double zero?
[98:42.26]You know, me and Johnny had something in common.
[98:45.20]Everybody has something to say about this shit.
[98:46.88]Like, can we just move on here?
[98:49.80]And then, somebody plugged him.
[98:53.01]Hey, not me.
[98:54.73]I took care of him.
[98:56.09]Oh, shit.
[98:58.35]Johnny Rock was good to me.
[99:01.43]I know this will be a risky case for you to take.
[99:03.77]But then I hear you're the best.
[99:07.87]Look.
[99:08.39]My fucking eyes hurt.
[99:09.67]I know, mine too.
[99:11.19]I can make sure it'll be worth your time.
[99:13.49]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[99:14.51]Let me like just double check and make sure this is not like on... Uh... Uh, there was like a filter.
[99:23.96]Does that look better?
[99:26.12]No scan lines.
[99:34.94]Uh.
[99:38.64]Hold on.
[99:38.82]Give me a second.
[99:45.20]Oh.
[99:46.66]Oh, dear.
[99:49.29]Oh, dear.
[99:53.71]Okay.
[99:55.43]Oh, God.
[99:56.23]That looks way worse.
[100:00.09]Number will appear several times during the game.
[100:01.45]Shoot your lucky number to win game money.
[100:03.07]Hold on a minute.
[100:03.59]I fucked this all up.
[100:05.72]It looks way worse.
[100:09.60]What did I do wrong?
[100:10.56]Okay, we need to go to... Okay, we're good.
[100:26.81]What, I have to solve Johnny Rockets' murder?
[100:29.69]Johnny Rockets, no.
[100:30.63]Johnny Rockets is a fucking restaurant, by the way.
[100:33.83]Okay, let's go.
[100:34.43]Let me just put this fucking shit back on there.
[100:37.03]Now let's do it.
[100:40.51]Who framed Roger Rabbit?
[100:41.97]Who killed Johnny Rocket?
[100:45.22]Uh, player one, gun and mouse.
[100:47.98]What?
[100:52.44]Gun?
[100:52.90]Is my mouse the gun?
[100:55.28]What happened?
[100:55.72]Who shooted?
[100:56.20]I just got shot.
[101:03.22]We're gonna have to shorten your nickname, slugger.
[101:06.16]What just fucking happened?
[101:07.32]There's someone to see you, boss.
[101:13.65]As soon as I saw her, I knew she was in trouble.
[101:17.71]I'm in trouble.
[101:19.81]I need your help.
[101:21.15]When I made my first mistake, I said I'd listen.
[101:25.04]Telegram for you, boss.
[101:25.96]It's not centered.
[101:26.54]I gotta shoot this guy.
[101:30.77]I'm dead.
[101:31.11]I don't think I can play this game without a controller.
[101:33.33]Hold on.
[101:33.69]Uh, give me a second.
[101:42.97]Keyboard.
[101:43.99]Yes.
[101:44.89]Up, down, left, right.
[101:48.17]Start.
[101:51.93]Okay.
[101:52.84]Um.
[101:54.64]Light gun cursor.
[101:55.72]Got it.
[101:56.62]Let's give that heart a listen.
[102:02.88]Why was it a car?
[102:04.68]My heart was a car.
[102:05.98]Alright, so light gun cursor.
[102:07.28]Is this gonna work?
[102:08.52]I don't think I can play this without a controller.
[102:11.46]Okay.
[102:32.14]Well, I'm not sure I can play this one.
[102:39.18]That's the person that shot Johnny Rocket, apparently.
[102:43.56]Power off.
[102:47.69]Well, that was fun for that one.
[102:52.57]That sure was fun for this one.
[102:57.06]There's no cursor, right?
[102:59.48]Wait a minute!
[103:01.32]What the fuck?
[103:01.78]What kind of cursor is this?
[103:03.24]What is this?
[103:05.84]This is like a fucking World of Warcraft guild logo.
[103:08.68]This is not a fucking cursor.
[103:10.04]Got him.
[103:11.60]Dead.
[103:17.61]Got him!
[103:18.19]Easy!
[103:18.37]Did- did I just do that?
[103:18.95]Did I just- Five!
[103:41.13]How many bolts do I have?
[103:42.89]I don't have any money.
[103:44.59]I have 362 bolts.
[103:45.43]Where do I keep them?
[103:46.77]Where do you keep all those bolts?
[103:50.25]Is this another fucking bad guy?
[103:52.83]Oh shit, I only have 349 bolts left.
[104:12.92]Why is this lady not giving a shit?
[104:16.95]What?
[104:18.31]Isn't the person in here?
[104:19.99]Take him to the morgue.
[104:23.23]Oh, dear.
[104:23.81]Okay.
[104:24.13]Oh, no.
[104:24.55]Out of luck.
[104:25.72]That's the name...
[104:35.33]Hold on.
[104:36.27]Did I attend my own funeral and shoot the fucking braced in the face at my own funeral?
[104:44.02]That's exactly what just happened.
[104:50.18]I didn't even get a chance, buddy.
[104:51.80]I didn't even get a chance.
[104:52.82]Alright, got him.
[105:01.23]That guy was just black.
[105:02.29]That guy blended in with the background so badly.
[105:04.07]Oh my god.
[105:05.29]To Cat's eye doctor.
[105:06.27]Yeah, we need an eye doctor after fucking looking at this shit.
[105:10.35]I didn't even get to read that.
[105:12.59]Didn't even get to fucking read it.
[105:19.60]Who's on the phone?
[105:20.78]Shoot him!
[105:21.08]What happened?
[105:33.95]Oh God, this is like Ghostbusters.
[105:35.85]Garage, ammo, office.
[105:38.95]Casino.
[105:40.51]Casino.
[105:48.24]I can't.
[105:53.46]Honest to God, man.
[105:54.38]Okay, well, it's $400 to go here and I don't have any more money.
[105:58.82]So shoot the lady.
[106:04.71]Yeah, patching you up anymore is like patching up a sieve.
[106:11.84]I don't have any money.
[106:12.58]I can't go over.
[106:13.20]Like, it's... I just lose.
[106:18.58]What are you doing here?
[106:32.34]I don't work for free.
[106:43.36]What's fucking happening?
[106:45.24]Alright.
[106:46.70]Casino.
[106:47.80]Shoot the lady right when she gets out of the elevator.
[106:49.94]Now.
[106:53.42]This guy too?
[106:56.22]Come on!
[106:57.16]That's such bullshit!
[107:00.03]The girl squawks like a fucking bird and then the guy from the left just like comes in, come on.
[107:07.81]No, we're not, I'm not nexting.
[107:09.10]And this went up to $500.
[107:09.70]Guy that's staring at me.
[107:17.64]This guy right here.
[107:19.00]You have to pre-fire everybody.
[107:22.92]Man, this guy, right?
[107:23.70]Come on, it's gotta be...
[107:27.81]Nurse, give me a hose.
[107:29.63]You'd make a good sprinkler.
[107:34.15]I don't need any ammo.
[107:40.34]God damn it.
[107:42.32]Let's go to the pool.
[107:45.64]What was I looking at there?
[107:51.16]What was I looking at?
[107:56.22]I was looking at a fucking Picasso painting and a guy died.
[108:00.25]What?
[108:02.95]How is that even fucking possible?
[108:05.51]I can't do anything now.
[108:06.79]Game over.
[108:07.22]Am I gonna shoot this guy?
[108:10.00]I just... I think I just blindly killed that guy.
[108:22.91]One of these guys is gonna have a gun.
[108:26.65]Who?
[108:27.15]Who has the gun?
[108:27.89]Just wait a minute.
[108:29.95]Wait one fucking minute here.
[108:31.41]Stay right here.
[109:06.59]That's the thing that shot me.
[109:10.52]There it is.
[109:13.12]Right here.
[109:18.37]You make out a human over there, guys?
[109:32.57]I crashed it, by the way.
[109:33.79]Hold on.
[109:36.65]We have to reload it.
[109:40.96]I see a face.
[109:41.68]You do not see a face.
[109:44.16]Don't give me that.
[109:44.82]There's no face there.
[109:46.22]I'm not done with this game.
[109:48.89]I refuse to be done with this game.
[109:52.77]It's too... I have to see the other places.
[109:55.77]It's very important.
[110:03.41]New emote.
[110:03.95]That guy's fucking face.
[110:09.59]Why didn't my SEGA CD do that?
[110:15.10]I saw it.
[110:15.72]I swear.
[110:16.18]4K revolution.
[110:17.40]4K revolution.
[110:20.02]Yep.
[110:20.54]Okay.
[110:21.92]Let's go down to options here.
[110:24.55]Just calibrate gun.
[110:25.99]Level wimp.
[110:29.37]Wimp.
[110:30.05]I want it on wimp.
[110:33.91]Make sure it's on WIMP.
[110:37.83]Good.
[110:41.28]Do you guys see how hard this is to do this?
[110:44.22]We have to play on WIMP.
[110:48.46]There's someone to see you, boss.
[110:50.95]As soon as I saw her, I knew she was in trouble.
[110:55.03]I'm in trouble.
[110:55.63]Skip this.
[110:57.11]I need your help.
[110:58.47]Then I made my first mistake.
[110:59.85]Gun, just skip, shoot the guy.
[111:01.27]Telegram for you, boss.
[111:08.42]And the guy in the mirror, right?
[111:09.86]Yeah.
[111:10.42]And here comes another guy with a fucking french bread.
[111:15.35]Bringing the guy with the french bread.
[111:16.31]There he is.
[111:16.61]He has a five in his hand.
[111:18.31]That's a different number.
[111:19.25]One.
[111:19.41]Okay.
[111:19.51]One.
[111:21.83]Johnny and I... You can call me Red.
[111:22.71]We were going to be married.
[111:40.63]Johnny had the goods on somebody.
[111:43.55]I don't want any French bread, buddy.
[111:46.53]Next time, duck!
[111:49.42]What?
[111:51.92]Johnny had the goods on somebody.
[111:54.98]I want you to find them.
[111:57.56]Who was it?
[111:58.00]Who shoots first?
[111:58.70]I asked if she would follow.
[112:00.12]She said she would.
[112:02.26]God!
[112:02.52]Okay, I'm good.
[112:03.06]The key to the mystery will be found in Johnny's safe.
[112:06.05]Fuck you, scrub.
[112:06.97]Wrong guy.
[112:09.51]There's the fucking painter that comes in and instantly dies, and his friend is back here too.
[112:13.10]I'm just gonna use my car full of bullets.
[112:19.46]Nail the rat that did this.
[112:22.66]Yeah.
[112:23.94]Let me actually read this.
[112:26.72]Must go to pool hall, casino, warehouse, and garage.
[112:29.08]Stop.
[112:30.06]Each of the four suspects has... This game was made for children and a kid can't read that one.
[112:35.47]Kid can't read that fast.
[112:36.51]Don't go to the office, okay?
[112:38.17]That's fine.
[112:38.51]We're gonna go to the... We're gonna go to the WIMP.
[112:48.70]No, oh, wait.
[112:49.20]Okay, that's the difficulty.
[112:50.50]The W here, I thought this was like the... Is this like a procedurally generated game?
[112:55.40]Let's go to JR.
[113:00.62]When the map of the city appears, shoot at the destination where you would like to go.
[113:03.50]Yeah.
[113:06.26]I know.
[113:11.82]Casino.
[113:20.53]Guy over here.
[113:25.33]And then this guy, right?
[113:26.35]This guy does it too, right?
[113:27.85]Oh my god, I forgot the guy wakes up.
[113:31.85]Oh my god.
[113:35.79]God damn it.
[113:48.66]And then you.
[113:50.91]Got him.
[113:51.21]Okay.
[113:51.35]I shot the gun a hundred times.
[113:54.61]What?
[114:09.20]Okay, which one of these smears of color is going to shoot at me?
[114:12.98]I don't know.
[114:13.56]I can't see.
[114:13.94]Where are they?
[114:14.64]That was a plant.
[114:15.20]God damn it.
[114:34.69]Was I supposed to do that?
[114:35.53]I didn't die.
[114:37.31]Oh my god.
[114:38.07]And I have no more money.
[114:39.53]Go to the garage.
[115:04.05]We're gonna give this one more attempt.
[115:09.69]One more attempt.
[115:10.89]And then we're gone.
[115:13.74]One more attempt at the casino.
[115:15.06]And we're out.
[115:17.22]At least it saves it.
[115:19.34]Okay, here we go.
[115:21.50]I gotta shoot this person right here.
[115:23.92]Oh my god, it's randomized.
[115:25.04]It is randomized.
[115:26.14]It's fucking randomly generated.
[115:29.08]I- This time the girl had a gun!
[115:31.67]The same girl had a gun.
[115:33.21]The same girl had a gun this time.
[115:40.55]The girl shot up with a fucking gun this time.
[115:43.93]Give me a break.
[115:45.83]She's gonna come up with a gun.
[115:51.87]Right here.
[115:52.13]You have to memorize everything.
[116:07.45]I can't get it.
[116:11.73]Let's move on.
[116:19.77]Okay.
[116:23.97]Okay.
[116:24.75]Let's go.
[116:27.87]The game is great.
[116:28.63]The game was great.
[116:29.83]It's just too hard to see.
[116:33.54]Alright, we're gonna play the meme game.
[116:35.04]You guys know it?
[116:35.80]Do you guys have any idea?
[116:36.45]We're gonna play the meme game.
[116:38.63]This game is a fucking meme.
[116:39.91]Everyone's gonna think it's so funny because this is like the... This was on like YouTube like fucking nine years ago.
[116:45.43]Everybody's gonna laugh their ass off at it.
[116:47.17]Because it was a meme and I was like, oh, maybe I'll play a fucking shitty meme game.
[116:50.61]Okay, fine.
[116:50.85]That's what we're gonna do.
[116:58.99]It's not Surgical Strike.
[117:03.78]It's not Battletoads.
[117:13.41]It's a fucking wild booty.
[117:17.33]Ow.
[117:17.61]Fucking easy.
[117:34.01]A, B, C. Okay, you got it.
[117:38.39]He just burped.
[117:38.91]Alright, here we go.
[117:43.17]You guys ready for the... We're only watching the opening cutscene.
[117:45.55]Then the whole joke is done.
[117:48.59]Man, it's good to be home.
[117:51.00]Hello, you have three new messages.
[117:55.72]Hey, Dusty.

[118:07.77]It's a pencil.
[118:08.43]It's me!
[118:08.69]I don't want it!
[118:09.61]Oh, jeez.
[118:09.95]Okay.
[118:10.31]Uh-huh.
[118:10.61]None of this matters.
[118:11.79]Just when we get to the actual cutscene.
[118:34.26]I'm just being quiet so we can see the meme and then we can fucking move on and play the next game That was fucking loud
[119:07.67]One went into the trash.
[119:11.00]Here he comes.
[119:13.76]Here comes the fucking meme.
[119:16.94]Here he comes!
[119:40.07]Whoa!
[119:40.31]Whoa, big fella!
[119:41.65]What's your name?
[119:42.53]Wild Woody!
[119:43.23]And that's the meme.
[119:47.14]Congratulations.
[119:47.92]Got the meme.
[119:48.40]We win.
[119:48.90]We win.
[119:49.54]That's the internet in a nutshell, you know?
[120:09.69]My good man, as of 15 seconds ago, I was BURNED to save the world!
[120:14.99]Where do I start?
[120:15.75]Squidflips went into that pirate bug, jumping after him, and look for sketches in there.
[120:20.16]Any sketch you draw will come to life.
[120:22.64]Now go!
[120:23.18]See ya in a jiff, my boy!
[120:25.22]It's time to start sketching!
[120:28.64]YAHOO!
[120:31.90]Remember, this is back when, like, Jim Carrey, like, in the mask and shit came out.
[120:36.22]The game, I think, sucks.
[120:38.00]So, like, don't worry about that.
[120:40.75]Let's go.
[120:41.15]Let me like turn this down.
[120:42.27]This is fucking loud as... This is loud and horrible.
[120:47.73]Here we go.
[120:48.17]Here's Wild Woody.
[120:52.00]And here we are.
[120:55.18]You rub your ass to sketch this jump.
[120:58.42]You gotta pick up like sketchbooks.
[120:59.54]You just jump over shit.
[121:01.20]That hurt.
[121:02.00]Okay.
[121:02.24]I don't think I can grab... I can't grab onto this.
[121:07.16]You erase people.
[121:10.13]We're currently like a pirate land Yes, if you were wondering this is just a shit platform We already saw the meme.
[121:20.34]We don't have to play anymore.
[121:21.66]What's the point of playing when you've already seen the fucking joke?
[121:32.67]It does have, like, the SEGA Genesis song music shit, though.
[121:35.89]Like that... The sound effects.
[121:38.31]You know what I'm talking about.
[121:39.01]That, like... Pick up the slide.
[121:45.80]We're good.
[121:50.18]Rub your ass on that guy's mouth.
[121:51.72]Okay, well... Why could that guy walk over there, but I couldn't?
[121:55.10]67%, we're currently at a fucking passing grade.
[122:09.59]Watch out for the knives.
[122:14.99]Excellent.
[122:19.85]Almost there.
[122:20.77]We win.
[122:22.75]I think I can jump on this.
[122:24.55]How do I get up there?
[122:29.39]No, he just dropped down.
[122:30.21]Alright.
[122:30.77]Feet climbed up the rope.
[122:33.11]The background is sickening.
[122:37.15]I'm about to die.
[122:39.01]Come on, just get to the end of level 1 in Wild Woody.
[122:41.39]That's all I care about.
[122:45.97]Almost there.
[122:46.35]Almost there.
[122:48.59]7%.
[122:49.48]Shit!
[122:55.68]Okay.
[123:03.18]We're done with Wild Woody.
[123:08.12]I hope you guys had fun.
[123:12.85]Didn't get a passing grade on that one, unfortunately.
[123:14.91]Alright, uh, the next one is going to be, uh, it's just another fucking one of these.
[123:21.57]Here we go.
[123:25.43]At least we got the meme done.
[123:29.97]That's all that matters.
[123:30.61]It's me!
[123:35.34]Wow, Woody!
[123:40.25]Alright, what else we got?
[123:41.57]It's party time.
[123:43.05]It's party time.
[123:45.27]It's Crime Patrol.
[123:51.07]Made by the same company that made Johnny Rockets.
[123:59.64]Licensed by SEGA Enterprises, LTD.
[124:01.18]Crime Patrol, 1992.
[124:01.56]Let's kick some butt.
[124:10.58]Welcome to undercover.
[124:16.00]Dude, nice effects.
[124:16.88]Oh.
[124:17.02]You gotta be tough to be on top of that.
[124:26.10]Yeah.
[124:36.62]Same company.
[124:38.42]Prime patrol.
[124:41.47]Executive producer Robert Grabe.
[124:44.83]Let's do it.
[124:46.69]Player one, I don't think the options are going to have very much.
[124:49.24]We're going to go on WIMP.
[124:50.86]It's the same company.
[124:51.62]They use the same exact shit.
[124:53.50]Wait, was it even on WIMP?
[124:59.88]No, it's on WIMP.
[125:02.37]Better be on fucking WIMP.
[125:03.71]I'll be very upset.
[125:06.25]Let's go.
[125:09.83]Shoot to choose a location.
[125:10.81]Let's go with... How about level one?
[125:20.40]That was easy.
[125:21.84]That level one is complete.
[125:23.68]Let's go.
[125:25.80]I love how my hand is like a little Simpsons hand.
[125:38.60]Look at how slow this is moving.
[125:40.52]Do you see how slow my hand is moving?
[125:46.69]Holy shit, I get like, look at this.
[125:55.82]This guy shows up right here.
[126:00.16]Got him.
[126:03.30]What?
[126:03.88]What?
[126:06.48]Oh my god.
[126:08.88]Fucking cheese hand.
[126:09.85]I have no bullets in the gun.
[126:12.23]How do you reload the gun?
[126:18.03]I don't think I'm ever gonna have a gun.
[126:19.07]Reloaded.
[126:23.15]Oh my god.
[126:23.63]That's how you reload?
[126:25.55]Holy shit.
[126:26.33]It's not gonna be possible.
[126:27.63]There's gotta be a way I can like do this, right?
[126:29.16]Hold on.
[126:32.74]Control is like a light gun cursor.
[126:34.62]Come on.
[126:36.56]Why can't I do that shit?
[126:39.34]Mouse.
[126:40.18]Oh, come on.
[126:50.54]I can't move with the... I can't.
[126:51.94]I have to use... No.
[126:53.50]I'm not going back to the casino.
[126:56.62]There's three buttons.
[126:57.54]Well, look at how slowly you move around.
[127:00.48]Look at this.
[127:01.82]Okay, so I shoot this guy, and I gotta shoot the guy right there.
[127:06.79]Got him!
[127:07.88]Let's kick some butt.
[127:08.91]Let's try this one more time.
[127:14.53]Didn't I play this?
[127:15.27]No.
[127:15.53]They all are melding together at this point though.
[127:19.89]We're at that gang fight location.
[127:26.35]We'll advise.
[127:28.98]What?
[127:31.90]Oh my god.
[127:32.58]It's not gonna work.
[127:33.38]I need like an...
[127:35.39]Not gonna work.
[127:36.93]I can't do it.
[127:41.74]As much as I'd love to do this, I can't.
[127:45.26]We have to move on.
[127:50.72]That was a great death, though.
[127:51.90]Unfortunately, I cannot play this without a Lycan.
[127:56.36]We only got a couple more.
[128:01.34]This is the one that didn't work in my SEGA CD.
[128:05.32]This one physically did not work in the SEGA CD, so we're gonna try it here.
[128:08.26]I don't remember what the name of the game is.
[128:24.61]Holy shit, my audio was way off, by the way.
[128:33.77]This whole time, my fucking mic has been, like, way far behind.
[128:37.37]Because, like, I'm not on the console anymore.
[128:40.77]Christ.
[128:46.41]Alright, let's go.
[128:53.01]This is the one with the Midnight Raider.
[128:55.89]When I got it, it wouldn't work.
[128:57.79]Well, it works now.
[129:01.80]This one's gonna be good.
[129:08.77]I can already tell.
[129:09.97]With an intro like this, you need to talk about your money was involved in this one.
[129:13.71]Lots of it.
[129:20.78]Midnight Raiders.
[129:25.62]SEGA presents the Gulf War.
[129:29.69]Because this is back in the 90s, dude.
[129:31.19]Everything was fucking messed up.
[129:33.84]You remember like the fucking scene in Ren and Stimpy when he had an ear full of ticks?
[129:39.80]And they zoomed up close and it was just his ear was stuffed with ticks?
[129:58.27]That's what we're talking about here.
[130:00.93]Some of these people may have even worked on that episode that made this fucking game.
[130:06.58]Dragonfly, this is Colonel Grimsby.
[130:08.36]Do you read me?
[130:09.14]This is Dragonfly.
[130:10.64]Word from Washington is that... Thank you, JKF, for the additional $10.
[130:13.66]...standard recon, Stryker.
[130:15.70]Stryker, this is JT... They replaced the olive on the pizza with pineapple.
[130:20.14]How fucking unbelievable is that?
[130:22.01]...proceed at bearing 170 until further notice.
[130:26.78]I think you stole them as well Mr. Adam do you mind telling you what this is all about colonel grimsby that sounds like John mccain three hours ago we received this code red communique from one of our operatives in the middle east this tape will show that the world's leading biochemist has been kidnapped and needs to be extracted immediately
[130:51.86]Can you read me?
[130:53.44]Here, Dr. Mensch.
[130:54.78]I must be fast.
[130:55.92]It may be the last chance I have to communicate with you.
[131:00.70]They have forced me to make a toxic formula that will destroy the world.
[131:05.32]You must rescue me immediately, or else the world will come to an end.
[131:07.78]No, please, Harry, please.
[131:08.76]Over.
[131:18.13]Oh no, it's the secret fucking KFC secret sauce.
[131:33.04]The lives of millions of people are at stake here, Grimsby.
[131:36.92]I don't want anyone to get a hold of this.
[131:39.19]This is what makes the chicken so crispy even when it's in the fucking microwave.
[131:43.89]Of course, I'll need congressional approval, Mr. Adams.
[131:47.76]McDonald's can't get a hold of this.
[131:58.05]This is going on very long, by the way.
[131:59.39]This is very long.
[131:59.93]What's going on with this guy's mouth?
[132:01.85]Is it a cross around the guy's head?
[132:04.47]Okay, is there a wimpy?
[132:05.15]Alright, difficulty.
[132:23.50]Oh, fuck.
[132:24.22]Okay, good.
[132:25.80]Easy.
[132:26.98]Target box is on.
[132:29.42]Done.
[132:29.66]Let's do it.
[132:35.54]Start game.
[132:42.60]Here we go.
[132:43.08]Dragonfly, this is Langley.
[132:45.90]Do you copy?
[132:46.70]That's me.
[132:47.48]This is Dragonfly.
[132:48.44]Is that you, Adams?
[132:49.70]Striker, we're getting cut out.
[132:53.14]Uh, yes, I am currently on an emulator right now.
[132:58.00]I do own these games.
[132:59.46]And I own the SEGA CD.
[133:02.00]But, uh... A couple of them haven't gotten here yet.
[133:04.91]And some of them just... This one was broken.
[133:06.81]This one just didn't work in the SEGA CD.
[133:08.09]What?
[133:08.25]What am I shooting?
[133:09.77]Shooting this other helicopter?
[133:29.18]Who was that?
[133:30.38]Was that like a civilian aircraft?
[133:33.50]It's odd.
[133:34.86]Kinda kinda close, aren't you?
[133:36.39]Where's your satellite recon, Adam?
[133:38.43]We almost bought the farm here.
[133:40.67]Soft striker.
[133:41.82]Oh, that's a cigar in his mouth.
[133:43.36]I thought he had like a mouth lesion.
[133:44.85]No time for joke Sparks.
[133:46.69]An enemy chopper was no accident.
[133:48.53]Meaning what?
[133:49.65]Meaning that the boys upstairs think your target's in place tonight.
[133:53.37]You mean we're going in?
[133:54.93]I'm calm.
[133:55.43]I got a rookie shooting.
[133:56.69]You're on point.
[133:57.97]So be it.
[133:58.59]We say your target's in, your target's in, buddy.
[134:01.42]Put me at point.
[134:02.22]Joker's in ready position.
[134:03.04]There's no smoke.
[134:03.70]That guy's not smoking that cigar.
[134:05.06]He's on point.
[134:07.70]Up, Tom.
[134:08.44]Make the best of it.
[134:09.46]The mission's on.
[134:10.89]That guy's just eating like a Slim Jim.
[134:12.33]That's not even a real cigar.
[134:18.03]You know what?
[134:18.55]What?
[134:19.15]Okay.
[134:19.42]Where?
[134:21.48]Where's the target?
[134:22.72]Right here?
[134:25.74]Got him.
[134:29.20]Those were laser beams.
[134:31.32]Did you hear that audio?
[134:35.43]That was like pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.
[134:48.11]I think I can.
[134:49.55]I'm pretty sure I can do it again.
[134:50.73]It's just like laser tag sound effects.
[134:52.83]You guys wanna go play laser tag?
[134:54.85]Wait, did that just say top secret?
[134:56.33]Hold on, let me know about my top secret fucking dinner menu.
[135:15.80]We got this from Applebee's and put a different fucking thing on it.
[135:19.60]We put different text on it.
[135:20.74]iPhone?
[135:31.39]What?
[135:39.30]What happened?
[135:40.70]What happened?
[135:42.04]Was I supposed to- Was I supposed to lose?
[135:45.42]What?
[135:45.66]Oh, goddammit.
[135:46.52]No.
[135:46.76]We're okay.
[136:09.57]Let's fucking camera.
[136:11.19]Can you please take it once I?
[136:17.22]Got it Where what am I supposed to do?
[136:29.76]Not bad, Joker.
[136:30.58]Think you can do that again?
[136:35.03]This really is like an action figure.
[136:36.57]Sorry it's so rough out there, kids, but I've got to ask you to keep going.
[136:39.51]Sir, can you send in some air cover?
[136:41.81]That's a negative, Dragonfly.
[136:42.61]I think I was supposed to lose that.
[136:43.67]There's no air cover for this mission.
[136:45.11]I'm pretty sure that... Oh, this is top secret.
[136:47.81]Did you see the menu?
[136:50.10]Also on the top secret.
[136:52.78]Got it.
[136:54.32]Yeah.
[136:57.26]Good work, Joker.
[136:58.42]Now do it again.
[137:00.95]There's a medium rare hamburger on there too.
[137:06.67]Just disregard that it's crossed out with whiteout.
[137:09.24]Don't worry You don't understand how hard that is to do
[137:24.64]Shut up.
[137:25.06]No, we've already heard that line.
[137:27.96]We heard that line three hours ago.
[137:29.68]In a different game.
[137:31.02]Oh, shit.
[137:31.40]What?
[137:31.64]What?
[137:53.29]I'm alive!
[137:53.89]Why are we wearing Hawaiian shirts?
[137:55.23]Why are we all in sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts?
[137:57.31]How many of these hinds do we have?
[137:59.91]Get it!
[138:00.21]Nice!
[138:24.41]It's so hard to hit these sometimes.
[138:26.23]Got it.
[138:28.65]Let's do it again.
[138:31.09]What?
[138:31.21]Proceed with care?
[138:31.79]Boss fight?
[138:32.19]That cigar is probably so fucking soggy right now and disgusting.
[138:52.82]You know, imagine taking that, that's a pizza.
[138:55.46]That's a pizza.
[138:57.20]That's a fucking pizza box.
[139:00.32]They have a bunch of top secret menus and pizzas.
[139:07.19]How do you fucking, what do you do?
[139:09.95]Got it.
[139:12.09]Top secret pizza box.
[139:14.83]Ridge coming up.
[139:15.59]What does that mean?
[139:22.39]We're just doing the same thing over and over again.
[139:28.85]Good shooting, kid.
[139:31.05]Joker couldn't hit the broadside of a barn.
[139:33.41]Put me in the lead.
[139:35.05]That's two conflicting opinions.
[139:37.72]I count two bogeys.
[139:40.20]Two?
[139:40.42]I got one.
[139:42.88]Get the next one.
[139:43.64]I got one left.
[139:46.22]Got him.
[139:48.06]That's a kill.
[139:49.50]Good work, Joker.
[139:51.87]Let's turn the dial a bunch of times.
[139:53.31]I win, right?
[139:53.83]Sir, an F-16 from that squadron back at Desert Base 4 had come in really handy about now.
[139:59.83]Negative, Dragonfly.
[140:00.93]Operation Midnight is top secret.
[140:03.43]Sorry, boys.
[140:04.65]You're on your own this time.
[140:05.73]Okay.
[140:06.65]Sir, how am I supposed to find this, Dr. Mensch, once we get inside the installation?
[140:11.33]I'll be in constant communication.
[140:12.63]Can you imagine pulling that cigar out and smelling the end that's been in his mouth?
[140:16.45]It definitely just smells like bad breath.
[140:18.48]What do you see, Colonel?
[140:20.49]You know like that like smelly breath smell that cigar and stinks like a fucking smelly breath tank Come on come on Got it
[140:49.30]Not bad, Joker.
[140:50.72]Think you can do that again?
[140:51.72]Is that us?
[140:54.46]Yeah.
[140:56.33]Ridge coming up, Striker.
[140:58.11]How much is more in the game to do?
[141:00.77]How many fucking enemy helicopters are in the game?
[141:07.48]Good work.
[141:08.46]Now do it again.
[141:09.96]This is never ending.
[141:10.82]This is like hell.
[141:11.62]This is like fucking military hell.
[141:13.43]They just keep giving us new coordinates and it's the same thing.
[141:16.67]It's a top secret.
[141:31.46]We're gonna get rid of the chemical weapons.
[141:33.22]Alright, I'll get it.
[141:33.82]I want to be done with this.
[141:34.86]We haven't lost yet, though.
[141:36.66]We haven't lost the game, so I can't move on yet.
[141:38.46]How are we supposed to move on?
[142:01.33]Good shooting, kid.
[142:02.65]You're seeding out.
[142:03.37]That's mild.
[142:06.03]We're about to clear the bridge.
[142:07.79]What do you see, Corrin?
[142:10.29]Part of my problem is not knowing you're supposed to go somewhere without me.
[142:15.67]I'm gonna make a lot of bogeys and kick them out.
[142:21.36]I count one bogey.
[142:24.40]Would somebody please show this kid how to shoot?
[142:28.43]Shut up, you smelly fuck.
[142:30.41]Get that fucking stinky cigar out.
[142:32.09]Wait, didn't we?
[142:32.59]We're in Groundhog Day.
[142:33.61]It's just, we're doing it again.
[142:35.45]We just keep doing the same shit, nothing changes.
[142:49.46]He has said the same line again.
[142:51.58]I'm sorry about this, fellas, but you have to stay out there.
[142:55.22]Unfortunately, there's no end to this.
[142:59.24]It doesn't end.
[143:00.74]You have to keep shooting these hinds in hell where you fucking belong, Joker.
[143:11.07]Get the tanks, too.
[143:17.47]It doesn't end!
[143:18.45]What's this?
[143:20.01]Got it instantly.
[143:21.17]No, I don't want to do it again.
[143:26.15]It doesn't end.
[143:26.63]How do I get away from this?
[143:27.83]Did we lose?
[143:46.81]Ghost is down.
[143:48.57]Ghost is down, Opcom.
[143:51.65]Take a hit!
[143:54.17]Take fire!
[143:56.75]I don't have control.
[143:59.51]We're down to just two choppers, Opcom.
[144:01.89]Two's plenty for this mission.
[144:03.59]Adams, this is a no-win situation with only two choppers.
[144:06.96]Abort mission.
[144:07.64]We'll abort this.
[144:08.20]Abort this mission when I say so.
[144:10.50]And not one second sooner do I make myself clear, old woman.
[144:16.07]Yes, and we're both made out of clay.
[144:18.37]Proceeding on.
[144:21.92]What would that be, sir?
[144:24.40]You'll find a special package in your mission pack.
[144:28.70]A mini-Mac.
[144:29.47]It's a little surprise that we cooked up... Oh my god, it doesn't end.
[144:34.35]It's kind of small,.
[144:36.63]A tactical nuke.
[144:38.43]You find Professor Minch... I've got to drop a nuke?
[144:41.13]This has got to be the end of the game.
[144:48.36]Good work, team.
[144:49.56]Take it on in.
[145:02.63]Operation Midnight.
[145:03.33]He said it.
[145:04.11]He said the name.
[145:04.89]Here we go.
[145:07.53]Here's the end of the game.
[145:10.65]I'm just gonna shoot the Death Star hole.
[145:12.84]Gonna shoot the... Is that a bad guy?
[145:17.42]What?
[145:20.40]It's... Everything's so dark.
[145:21.24]I can't... Do I have to shoot these people or what?
[145:28.20]What happened?
[145:33.96]I've found a dragonfly.
[145:35.68]Looks like it's in abort.
[145:36.70]Yes, sir.
[145:37.24]What?
[145:37.62]Aborting mission.
[145:43.69]Fuck.
[145:44.35]Hold on.
[145:44.79]What?
[145:44.93]Alright.
[145:45.43]We got...
[146:06.18]Here we go.
[146:06.82]Here's another one.
[146:12.92]I think this is the last one, by the way.
[146:19.54]I'm fairly certain this is the last one.
[146:28.10]Get your LOLs in.
[146:29.76]Here comes the final SEGA CD game.
[146:41.04]Tom Zito presented this one.
[146:48.01]This one's called Supreme Warrior.
[146:54.61]You direct.
[146:55.21]This is going to be a trap people in the mountains.
[147:06.51]Expand those pixels.
[147:18.23]Played SEGA and didn't even get Sonic?
[147:19.65]Yeah, but like, fucking who cares about Sonic, right?
[147:24.26]Sonic CD is like, they've released it like five times.
[147:29.68]Earthworm Jim, Sonic, like, Chuck Rock, these are all games we're forsaking.
[147:33.58]Nobody fucking has this game.
[147:35.96]I didn't want to show, like, playing a 2D Sonic game, like, who cares?
[147:45.25]Sonic CD, you can get it for, like, one of the compilations.
[147:47.42]They've released it, like, fucking 19 times.
[147:52.30]Supreme Warrior is not a game.
[147:53.80]Like, I... You don't easily get this game.
[147:59.09]Here we go.
[148:00.95]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[148:06.43]This is a province in China.
[148:11.56]This is fucking sick, actually.
[148:16.07]Why couldn't they all have been, like, this, like, well, like, choreographed?
[148:26.60]This one's got, like, actual production value.
[148:33.48]Pretty sick sound.
[148:34.26]Pretty sick sound effect.
[148:37.75]And he fucking dropped the piano on him, too.
[148:39.25]Is that me?
[148:47.03]It's hard to see.
[148:47.79]I can't really tell.
[148:48.53]Good, but not good enough.
[148:54.10]Don't you dare!
[148:56.02]Did he shoot electricity out of his bow?
[148:58.32]Who the fuck is that?
[149:00.30]Oh, God.
[149:01.00]It's the long-lost member of KISS.
[149:09.58]My, my, my.
[149:12.54]Car.
[149:14.06]This is all ADR by the way.
[149:16.80]This is all dubbed over.
[149:18.48]I love it.
[149:21.89]The best one so far.
[149:41.22]I'm glad we ended on this one, because this is by far the best one.
[149:43.68]Every one.
[149:43.88]All of us.
[149:50.18]Every human heart.
[149:51.02]That's like seven billion hearts.
[149:53.16]Not gonna fit all in one steak, buddy.
[150:08.03]They have painted mustaches on.
[150:10.01]They have painted fucking goofy mustaches on.
[150:12.07]Did you see that?
[150:13.95]Like strong men mustaches.
[150:15.95]The guys that ride the big tricycles.
[150:17.30]What?
[150:18.26]It was that close?
[150:24.20]Wait, hold on.
[150:25.16]I had the mask on me?
[150:36.72]That guy was looking for the mask, and I'm just sitting there holding it out in the open?
[150:41.02]When we find that mask, you will all die.
[150:43.69]Give it to me, I will find it.
[150:45.49]Hey, you have it.
[150:46.65]In your hands.
[150:47.41]That's a big fucking mask.
[150:55.29]This is a game.
[150:55.93]This is the best one so far.
[150:57.21]I'm glad this is the last one.
[151:02.06]I hope the gameplay is as good as this cutscene is.
[151:05.84]Sit.
[151:07.73]Somebody look up Guy Norris right now.
[151:09.11]Guy Norris.
[151:09.33]Who is it?
[151:21.60]That's a Norris last name.
[151:23.56]Is that like Chuck Norris' son?
[151:25.64]Or like Chuck Norris' dad?
[151:27.58]How old is Chuck Norris in like 1994?
[151:30.92]15?
[151:31.02]It was like 40.
[151:37.07]He's a stuntman.
[151:39.13]Let's look at this guy's IMDB.
[151:44.61]Okay, Guy Norris.
[151:45.85]Guy Norris is known for his work on Mad Max Fury Road.
[151:52.15]Suicide Squad and Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring.
[151:55.59]This dude is a fucking superstar.
[151:58.77]This guy is like a monster in the industry now.
[152:01.24]We will help.
[152:04.24]The guy that like stunt coordinated Mad Max Fury Road is responsible for this game.
[152:09.78]Give me a fucking break.
[152:11.48]That's pretty remarkable actually.
[152:13.78]You control our destiny.
[152:17.57]This is going to be legit.
[152:22.90]Which one do I pick?
[152:43.02]I'm not sure.
[152:43.42]Which one do I pick here?
[152:44.08]I don't know.
[152:52.67]We're gonna go win!
[152:55.38]Oh, shit!
[153:01.64]I don't think I have- do I have the second disk?
[153:05.60]Alright, shut up.
[153:09.98]Shut this up.
[153:10.58]Shut it up.
[153:12.68]Stop.
[153:13.98]Okay.
[153:16.29]Uh, disk two.
[153:18.01]Already, disk two.
[153:20.47]Oh, shit.
[153:23.65]Uh, hold on.
[153:29.46]Fuck.
[153:36.46]I got wind, right?
[153:39.02]We're okay.
[153:39.74]How do you play?
[153:42.74]How do you play the game?
[153:44.79]What are these knobs?
[153:49.33]What do the knobs do?
[154:00.92]I don't understand, like, is this like a rhythm game?
[154:06.24]The Hainan warlord, the fire master to Fang Tu.
[154:09.89]Legend has it, he was born out of a great fireball that collided with the Earth.
[154:15.19]Let's go.
[154:16.27]Do you have the mask of Fang Tu?
[154:29.59]I do have it though.
[154:31.38]I got hands now!
[154:33.62]It's one of these games.
[154:34.50]No!
[154:50.52]It's one of these fucking games.
[154:52.20]No!
[154:54.82]I just shoved him.
[155:01.25]Got it.
[155:02.29]I think I died.
[155:05.95]What is happening right now?
[155:16.95]This dude is doing this.
[155:29.81]I don't understand.
[155:30.63]I don't, guys.
[155:33.01]These games are all so difficult to do.
[155:35.73]I'm gonna get it eventually.
[155:49.74]I'll figure it out.
[155:58.45]Shit.
[156:01.19]Oh, it's one of these dumb games.
[156:02.37]Like, I think I have to go to the same side that he's on.
[156:05.11]I guess.
[156:07.57]Oh, we need to see the rest of the game.
[156:15.90]Oh, god damn it.
[156:22.82]Where's your master's philosophy now?
[156:26.58]There's just like no fucking rhyme or reason to these games.
[156:30.74]Prizefighter was the same fucking way.
[156:32.60]It was the same exact way.
[156:41.54]Killed him!
[156:42.34]What's happening now?
[156:46.62]I can't even control the character anymore.
[156:50.78]I can't do anything.
[156:54.23]No buttons work anymore.
[156:56.19]So that's fucking good.
[157:02.81]Nothing works.
[157:03.27]I'm just screaming in his face.
[157:10.80]Okay.
[157:13.98]This button works.
[157:16.56]That's just A and D, by the way.
[157:30.12]Does that mean he's coming this way?
[157:31.48]I think that's what that means.
[157:45.17]Why did it have to be a shitty Prizefighter game?
[157:48.85]These games don't make any fucking sense.
[157:52.29]They make zero sense.
[157:58.05]I can't touch this guy.
[158:04.48]It's really like well crafted and we have to not play it because it's like an impossible to play video game.
[158:15.77]Sounds like Mario.
[158:18.27]Use your Hoya button.
[158:19.63]Alright, so let's go over this.
[158:25.61]I can't punch him.
[158:28.49]Nothing connects.
[158:30.64]Use the green hints.
[158:31.54]What the fuck do the green hints even mean?
[158:35.29]The green circles on the edges, what does that even mean?
[158:37.89]Does that mean, like, punch him that way or block that way?
[158:43.25]That shit don't make any fucking sense.
[158:44.71]I'm gonna train.
[158:52.64]Let's work on the punches.
[158:54.86]Give me a fucking tutorial.
[158:56.32]This shit is fucking stupid.
[158:58.58]Hooks.
[159:00.98]Use your hook when a fighter comes in close and the side of his face is open.
[159:06.69]Left or right?
[159:08.15]This is not helping.
[159:11.79]Palm heel.
[159:14.05]When you can see the face straight on, go in for palm heel.
[159:18.89]Left or right?
[159:20.23]This is not helping.
[159:25.66]Very helpful.
[159:29.10]Body punch.
[159:31.29]When the fighter comes in close and his head is covered, punch low to the body.
[159:36.68]Okay.
[159:36.80]Thanks.
[159:41.86]But remember, your punches will not work if you're too far away.
[159:45.98]Okay.
[159:48.92]So, if I see his face close... If he comes in close, that's when you punch him in the side.
[159:58.55]Okay, here we go.
[160:01.15]Okay, this is fine.
[160:02.51]Block.
[160:05.05]No.
[160:05.15]Here we go.
[160:05.57]It's fine.
[160:08.01]You can hit me once.
[160:31.96]This shit is fucking stupid.
[160:34.06]It's fucking stupid.
[160:35.92]It's the dumbest fucking thing ever.
[160:42.24]And now I have no control of the character anymore.
[160:49.69]All I can say is, oh yeah.
[160:51.29]There's no control.
[160:52.75]Now I have control of the character.
[160:54.31]Isn't that great?
[160:55.01]Now I got control of the character.
[160:58.37]I don't know what you just- I don't know what you just said.
[161:04.94]I'm gonna fucking block.
[161:10.12]I'm just gonna hold this until I see a prompt.
[161:13.88]Okay, I didn't get it apparently.
[161:28.99]This fucking game sucks.
[161:35.63]It's not possible.
[161:37.19]It's fucking impossible to attack anyone.
[161:42.56]It's just not fucking possible.
[161:46.74]You fucking do it.
[161:47.86]You do it and you fucking send me a tweet.
[161:49.66]Alright?
[161:50.76]You fucking get into this game.
[161:52.50]Do what I just did.
[161:53.50]Send me a tweet.
[161:54.66]I want to see you do it.
[161:56.05]Do it.
[161:58.43]All the people fucking talking shit.
[162:00.01]You do it!
[162:00.63]Send me a fucking tweet!
[162:02.89]www.Twitter.com.com Send it to me.
[162:06.18]I'd love to see it.
[162:12.52]You got the fucking Twitter account.
[162:13.82]You know where it is.
[162:19.92]Did I turn off English following?
[162:21.83]I think I turned off English.
[162:31.51]Did I turn the English off?
[162:32.91]I learned the speed run.
[162:43.51]Oh, he really did kill everybody, huh?
[162:47.51]I wonder what he's saying.
[163:02.15]I didn't see any hearts, no, neither did I. I don't think I can skip this.
[163:07.86]An association with the Shaw brothers.
[163:16.53]Come on, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[163:23.97]The intro is the best part, I know, right?
[163:28.46]It's had an opportunity to be so good.
[163:29.88]It had to take the prizefighter route.
[163:33.34]Just like the fucking mess.
[163:36.40]Where like, it's just, it's just, there's no rhyme or reason to fucking anything.
[163:42.01]Prompts come on the screen, you like throw punches, don't even matter.
[163:46.57]This game has like a fucking zero.
[163:49.09]Uh, this game has like a .8 score.
[163:51.97]It's got like at least a 3.
[163:52.87]Let's go.
[164:02.13]And half the time the controls don't even work.
[164:04.81]That doesn't help.
[164:05.57]Here we go.
[164:15.45]But there's no prompts on the screen of what to do with this.
[164:17.75]How many of you don't have enough 20 to hit him?
[164:23.40]He wants me to kick then.
[164:25.86]Holy shit dude, don't way.
[164:36.95]What the fuck?
[164:40.44]Oh, I hit him!
[164:41.18]I got him!
[164:41.56]I kicked him in the face!
[164:45.84]I'm dead!
[164:51.04]No, I'm fucking out.
[164:51.90]I'm done.
[164:52.48]I'm fucking out of here.
[164:55.02]I'm done playing this fucking game.
[164:57.78]The same shit happened with Prizefighter, and that game was just as much of an unbearable mess as this one is.
[165:04.08]Get the fuck out of here, game.
[165:10.26]Now, you guys didn't think there was a secret game, did you?
[165:19.92]Is there a secret game?
[165:20.86]Actually, I don't think there is a secret game.
[165:23.37]Oh, shit.
[165:23.77]Now there has to be a secret game.
[165:25.07]Alright, fine.
[165:27.97]You guys want a secret game?
[165:33.79]Here's your secret game.
[165:34.62]I'll be right back.
[165:40.73]Here's your secret game.
[166:13.49]Give me a sec.
[166:13.79]Give me a sec.
[166:14.45]You're going to get it.
[166:16.11]No joke.
[166:16.45]There's no joke here.
[166:17.25]This is your secret game.
[166:21.65]Be here in like 15 seconds.
[166:25.10]No, it's a SEGA CD game.
[166:26.28]Come on.
[166:26.84]What are you taking me for here?
[166:38.98]It's not Wirehead.
[166:40.18]No.
[166:45.11]Not Wirehead.
[166:53.27]What the hell is my avatar supposed to be?
[166:54.71]Me.
[166:56.67]It's literally me.
[166:59.80]Okay, here you go.
[167:00.50]Here's how we're going to end the stream.
[167:06.56]Here you go.
[167:09.92]Y'all wanted it.
[167:10.94]You're gonna get it.
[167:11.50]You're gonna get it for a good, like, 25 seconds.
[167:18.06]At least, like, fucking four of you in chat wanted me to play this.
[167:21.38]Here comes the end.
[167:29.13]Yep.
[167:30.11]There he is.
[167:31.77]Sonic the Hedgehog.
[167:32.79]Sonic 3D CD.
[167:45.08]Isn't there a fucking video here?
[167:47.10]What happened to the video?
[167:48.96]Isn't this like a full motion video?
[167:54.16]Wow.
[167:56.00]Holy shit.
[167:58.26]This is so cool.
[168:00.54]This is nothing like the other Sonics.
[168:07.77]What?
[168:08.15]What?
[168:09.11]You can move wicked fast.
[168:12.87]Whoa.
[168:23.63]This time it, like, spins around in a circle.
[168:29.04]Wirehead 2?
[168:29.52]There's no such thing as Wirehead 2.
[168:34.50]Wirehead 2 doesn't exist.
[168:38.56]Told me that he wouldn't play Sonic, but he doesn't care now.
[168:43.71]This is kind of fun.
[168:45.55]This is kind of a fun game.
[168:50.04]Oh, Jesus Christ, somebody gave $100.
[168:51.66]Hold on a second.
[168:56.34]Why did you give $100 right now?
[168:57.56]I'm playing Sonic CD.
[168:59.80]Oh, God.
[169:00.52]Hold on.
[169:03.72]Which Sonic is this?
[169:04.76]Sonic CD.
[169:07.84]Sonic Compact Disk.
[169:10.20]I'm gonna be the first boss.
[169:13.33]Hold on.
[169:13.69]Somebody... Fuck.
[169:15.93]Cigarette spaghetti dropping mad money again.
[169:17.77]Hold on a second.
[169:19.70]CigaretteSpaghetti, thank you for the $100.
[169:22.10]You can't fool me, these graphics are Sonic 06 for the Xbox 360.
[169:26.52]And I think the game crashed.
[169:29.12]Uh, thank you so much, Cigarette.
[169:30.32]You've been, you've given, like, well over, like, $500 or $600 the last few days.
[169:36.42]That's a lot of fucking money, dude.
[169:37.62]Thank you.
[169:39.72]Uh, but no, this is, this is, in fact, this is Sonic, this is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[169:46.38]We're gonna be the first boss.
[169:48.02]I bet you guys that Dr. Robotnik is gonna be in like a fucking floating egg.
[169:53.23]And I gotta bump him three times.
[169:56.35]He's gonna be in this like generic egg.
[169:57.71]Don't worry.
[170:00.41]We haven't played this game like six times already, SEGA, by this point in history.
[170:06.27]I'm being like a real asshole right now.
[170:07.75]No, I'm just kidding.
[170:08.69]I like Sonic.
[170:10.13]I enjoy Sonic.
[170:12.89]Sonic is like cool.
[170:13.93]He's funny.
[170:14.83]He fucking runs fast.
[170:18.99]It's like eggs in this game.
[170:19.99]How can I hate this game?
[170:25.19]We're gonna get to the first Dr. Eggnick.
[170:27.31]Egg Robotnik.
[170:28.55]What did I say?
[170:29.27]Eggnick?
[170:30.97]Dr. Eggnick.
[170:36.96]But before we go, this is gonna be the cap of the stream here.
[170:42.02]Tuesday is gonna be Jerma Rumble.
[170:44.94]Oh, a Jerma card.
[170:45.90]Wait, what?
[170:46.44]What happened to the fucking boss?
[170:48.00]Did it just skip a level?
[170:50.86]So, Tuesday I'm gonna spend all weekend making characters and making up, like, cards and scenarios and stuff.
[170:56.46]So you will see WWE 2K17 on Tuesday.
[170:59.16]There's a lot of characters that have been introduced over the last, like, six months of streams, so it should be fun.
[171:09.65]And if it isn't, then, sorry, I tried.
[171:13.82]make Wild Woody?
[171:14.88]Fine.
[171:15.04]And I'm going to have... Oh, here we go.
[171:17.64]I wonder if it's going to be... Oh, look!
[171:19.24]It's Dr. Robotnik and he's in a mech suit.
[171:21.86]Watch out!
[171:22.60]He's going to punch you!
[171:23.70]Oh, no!
[171:27.74]Get him!
[171:28.76]Right in the belly!
[171:33.28]Come on, Sonic!
[171:34.78]Oh, no!
[171:36.17]Whoa!
[171:36.31]Three times!
[171:37.75]Three times!
[171:47.15]Told you.
[171:48.37]Sorry.
[171:48.59]What do you want me to do here?
[171:52.43]What do you want me to do here, game?
[171:59.69]Alright, should we save the animals?
[172:01.28]Alright, let's save the animals.
[172:12.92]Holy shit, dude.
[172:17.54]Donating to have a character added to the Jerma Rumble.
[172:20.06]The human cigarette.
[172:23.72]I don't think I can do that.
[172:28.02]I don't know if I can... 2K17 sucks.
[172:30.20]Is that Amy?
[172:38.55]What Sonic is that?
[172:41.45]Is it Robot Sonic?
[172:42.55]I haven't kept up with my Sonic lore, guys.
[172:44.47]Sorry.
[172:46.81]I'll try to put a cigarette in the rumble.
[172:48.19]Alright, that's it.
[172:52.10]We beat the first boss.
[172:58.10]Alright, guys.
[172:58.72]That's going to wrap it up.
[173:00.16]I need to clean up this mess back here.
[173:01.74]There's like 17, like 18 CDs back here.
[173:07.99]I ran over one of them accidentally.
[173:11.10]But yeah, that's going to wrap it.
[173:13.03]Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[173:15.66]We're going to close it out.
[173:18.83]Wanted to just make sure I finished up the SEGA CD stuff.
[173:23.65]Because there was still, like, obviously, like, at least a few hours.
[173:26.23]Or, like, a couple hours worth of stuff.
[173:28.28]So, hopefully you had fun.
[173:30.10]Don't mind my rage at not being able to figure out 27-year-old games.
[173:34.98]But, yeah, that's just the way it is.
[173:37.61]Good night, everybody.
[173:38.75]See you on... SEGA CD isn't over.
[173:42.79]See you on Tuesday for a wrestling card.
[173:46.15]It's going to be like it was last time.
[173:47.85]I'm going to spend all weekend on it, so hopefully it's at least worth watching.
[173:53.67]Good night.
[173:54.21]Thank you so much, especially to Cigarette Spaghetti.
[173:57.23]Like right now, just giving $200 in five minutes.
[174:00.77]And obviously everybody else that's given money.
[174:02.30]A lot of people have today and yesterday.
[174:06.20]Much love.
[174:07.90]I'll be sending you the complete Supreme Warrior Challenge.
[174:11.50]Yeah, you got the fucking... Yeah, I'll give you the... Here you go.
[174:18.14]It didn't even work.
[174:19.64]It's alright.
[174:20.60]I was apparently so angry I couldn't even write it.
[174:22.98]Whatever.
[174:24.78]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[174:26.34]I'll see you guys Tuesday.
[174:27.66]Bye-bye.
[174:28.62]Thank you.
[175:31.28]BONUS WILD BUDDY STREAM!

[176:20.28]Open the box.
[176:21.04]Come on, open it up.
[176:22.56]Erase.
[176:23.26]What am I erasing?
[176:24.56]Erase what?
[176:25.78]There's nothing to erase.
[176:49.58]Oh shit!
[176:50.68]Look at that fucking tactic!
[176:54.32]Cigarettes!
