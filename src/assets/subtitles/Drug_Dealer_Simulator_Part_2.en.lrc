[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.80]Yeah, I thought everybody was ignoring me.
[00:03.60]Like, there's no way that all of them can collectively pretend that I'm not streaming.
[00:09.34]I was like, this is kind of crazy.
[00:12.53]Like, maybe they can.
[00:15.90]Because I saw a bunch of- I saw at least five or six people in all capitals, live, live, live, but I think people just say that no matter what, just to, I guess, fuck with other people?
[00:26.93]To pretend that I was live?
[00:28.05]Like, they had a stream, but other people didn't?
[00:30.56]I was like, wait, how does that make any sense?
[00:34.25]I was sitting here talking to nothing for at least 60 seconds.
[00:38.25]I did a, I did a Twitch broadcast test, an internet test.
[00:43.45]I was just checking different things with this new connection to see what the best route is.
[00:48.53]And I think I got it.
[00:52.03]I forgot it was on.
[00:53.75]So it was still on when I pressed the, now it's time to really stream.
[00:57.59]We have 10 community subs from the chef's corner.
[01:02.91]Chef's Corner has been incredibly generous lately.
[01:06.25]Thank you, Chef's Corner.
[01:07.11]Appreciate it.
[01:07.59]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[01:12.14]Welcome back, though, guys.
[01:12.92]Hi.
[01:13.10]Nice to see you.
[01:15.32]We have a very, very interesting week planned ahead of us here.
[01:18.90]Well, mid-week into weekend.
[01:20.92]We're gonna go back to the crack game.
[01:22.35]I just... The drug dealer simulator.
[01:25.37]The crack game.
[01:26.07]We're just gonna call it the crack game.
[01:27.17]That's what it is.
[01:28.41]A nondescript civilian.
[01:29.61]Thanks for 10 community subs.
[01:33.42]10 from nondescript and 10 from the chef's corner.
[01:35.62]Thanks, both of you guys.
[01:36.35]Oh, yeah, we're going to play the drug dealer game again just for a little bit.
[01:40.15]I just want to play it.
[01:40.85]I'm kind of into it.
[01:43.13]I'll probably get my fill of it today.
[01:45.07]Who knows?
[01:46.73]But tomorrow, we're going to get the real schedule here.
[01:51.41]Because I've been flipping it around because like, oh, it's going to be Thursday.
[01:54.00]That's going to be on Saturday.
[01:55.14]That's going to be on Sunday.
[01:56.22]But that's going to be on Friday.
[01:57.20]But I want to play the crack game.
[01:58.42]So let's get it for real with the real thing here.
[02:01.54]Crack game tonight.
[02:03.18]Tomorrow we're going to do community content night.
[02:05.61]That leaves us with the weekend of Friday and Saturday.
[02:08.13]Friday is going to be movie night.
[02:11.23]So that will actually be happening on Friday.
[02:13.71]Public domain movie night is Friday.
[02:15.55]Like that's just it.
[02:17.09]That's the one that's today it's going to be.
[02:19.87]Saturday is supposed to be the Easy Bake Oven stream.
[02:22.27]But I'm telling you right now, I'm having a little bit of reservations on it.
[02:26.33]For one reason.
[02:30.72]A space.
[02:32.98]I probably am going to have to go to the studio to do the Easy Bake Oven stream.
[02:42.63]Now imagine taking that phone call.
[02:47.54]Oh, yeah, this is the movie studio.
[02:49.04]Hi, yeah, remember me?
[02:50.80]Oh, yeah, the green screen guy.
[02:52.45]Yeah, that's me.
[02:54.17]What can I do for you?
[02:55.93]Oh, you know, I'm thinking about coming and using your space to use an Easy Bake Oven.
[03:02.49]That's all.
[03:02.90]I just want to use an Easy Bake Oven at the studio.
[03:07.10]Oh, that's it?
[03:08.80]Yeah, that's it.
[03:09.66]I just have like 20 recipes.
[03:13.15]Why don't you just do it at your house?
[03:15.06]Well, you know, because I want the space and I want to be able to like fucking do like look-a-mays and stuff.
[03:19.54]I can't like, there's not enough space for the cameras to catch me doing like look-a-may when in the middle of it.
[03:25.04]Oh, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Elbertson.
[03:27.04]Absolutely.
[03:29.18]So if I cannot get studio space by Saturday, then we're going to, we'll do it like a day or two later.
[03:36.92]But I'm going to be in the studio for the Easy Bake Off and Stream.
[03:39.84]It just, I'm just gonna like, whatever.
[03:43.64]I'm gonna put, like, a fucking chef background behind me on the green screen.
[03:46.94]It'll be a fu- It'll be a mess.
[03:48.26]Don't worry.
[03:55.13]Is the studio open?
[03:56.57]Oh, shit.
[04:01.27]Ah, yeah.
[04:02.57]That's another thing, isn't it?
[04:04.11]Huh.
[04:07.46]Well, I- Here's the thing.
[04:08.64]I have to assume maybe, because...
[04:11.67]Oh, no.
[04:12.69]No, it's not.
[04:13.49]It probably won't be, right?
[04:14.41]Because it's like a... Because there's no... Oh.
[04:22.98]I'll check.
[04:23.54]I'll check.
[04:23.90]I'll see.
[04:25.48]Because when you rent studio space, nobody else is... Nobody's there.
[04:29.46]It's like you're renting part of the studio, so it's not like there'll be a bunch of people around.
[04:33.16]I have no idea.
[04:35.58]I have to make a few phone calls.
[04:38.39]Oh, Easy Bake Oven stream fucking canceled.
[04:41.54]No.
[04:44.45]I just wanted to have some more space.
[04:49.85]Oh, and the Toontown stream.
[04:51.31]First was the Toontown stream.
[04:52.39]No, let's see what happens.
[04:54.79]If I have to do it from here, I will.
[04:57.53]But I have to set up the cameras in a way where I can see everything.
[05:01.65]Because I don't want to have... Alright, listen.
[05:05.03]For streams that happen when I'm on camera, I don't want another unlock card game stream.
[05:11.92]And what I mean by that is forget about how fucking bad that stream potentially was because the stream was just bad.
[05:17.78]Right?
[05:19.07]Let's talk about like how you couldn't see anything.
[05:22.07]Couldn't read the text.
[05:23.08]You couldn't see the close up.
[05:25.04]I want to make sure that there's like you can see stuff.
[05:32.85]That stream was horrible.
[05:34.37]I don't think it was horrible.
[05:35.51]It was bad.
[05:36.91]It was pretty bad.
[05:37.67]Because you couldn't even, like, see.
[05:39.21]You couldn't read.
[05:40.01]I couldn't do basic children's math problems.
[05:44.68]Yeah, and you couldn't read anything.
[05:46.26]The camera wasn't good enough.
[05:47.68]You know what I mean?
[05:48.20]I want to make sure I don't fall down that path again.
[05:51.92]It wasn't as bad as Hearthstone.
[05:53.31]Wow, you must have hated that stream.
[05:57.69]You must have hated that Hearthstone stream.
[06:02.19]But anyways, we're going to play more Crack Game.
[06:05.03]Just going to play it for a few hours.
[06:07.40]And then tomorrow, Community Content Night.
[06:10.04]I will get that prepared.
[06:11.56]It should be Community Content Night up until... I'm like forever behind on Community Content Night.
[06:19.76]We might have to do, like, a lightning round to catch up.
[06:23.42]Because it's gonna be from, like, February, like, 15th or something to, like, March 15th.
[06:29.99]I'm gonna be forever, like, 30 days behind Community Content Night.
[06:36.35]And I even did two.
[06:38.17]I did one to catch up, and it didn't matter.
[06:48.16]No, skip.
[06:48.94]No, skip.
[06:49.74]No, skip.
[06:53.70]You're a year behind the green screen stream.
[06:56.14]Well, if I get into the studio, then I can do a little bit in front of the screen.
[07:01.07]I'll be there.
[07:04.43]But let's play.
[07:05.75]I'm going to play this video game.
[07:08.75]You know what it is.
[07:09.37]Move the thing so you can see.
[07:14.96]He's a year behind on VR.
[07:16.80]That's not true.
[07:17.36]When was the last time I played VR?
[07:20.26]I played VR.
[07:20.97]I thought that was in my house.
[07:23.43]I thought that was just my room.
[07:27.35]That just scared the shit out of me.
[07:28.95]I was like, somebody opened my door?
[07:30.61]When was the last time I played VR?
[07:37.21]It wasn't a year ago.
[07:38.27]It was like two months ago.
[07:39.91]It was a long time ago.
[07:43.84]Alright, what were we doing?
[07:45.00]I just got access to Ecstasy.
[07:49.08]By the way, I'm just thinking about this right now.
[07:52.16]If you happen to not know what was going on in here, and you heard from outside the door, or if you heard me talking like this,
[08:03.58]What do you think?
[08:04.80]That'd be weird, right?
[08:06.44]Okay, yeah, so I just got access to ecstasy.
[08:08.34]How much should I buy?
[08:08.94]Uh, I'm gonna say like 20 grams of ecstasy and I'll sell the, I'll sell the amphetamines.
[08:15.07]Uh, that's, I, I'm gonna be like quiet.
[08:20.31]Okay, I'm gonna like say these things quietly.
[08:22.69]I don't, I don't know.
[08:23.45]You know what I mean?
[08:24.33]Like, that's just fucking weird.
[08:25.87]Alright, so, I'm gonna call, no, I'm gonna, alright, I have, there's orders.
[08:34.39]Remember Whisper, my mom's in the room.
[08:36.03]Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs!
[08:38.55]How did I just do that?
[08:39.27]That was 50 fucking thousand dollars from Freddy Dredd.
[08:45.73]Freddy Dredd just gave 50 community subs.
[08:47.53]Freddy Dredd just drops thousands of dollars here.
[08:50.81]The man, Freddy Dredd.
[08:55.20]Thanks a lot, Freddy.
[08:58.00]Thanks for the 50 fucking subs.
[09:01.92]That's so much.
[09:04.68]Like, I've... I've dropped, like, 100 community subs before.
[09:09.14]I've dropped, like, 500 community subs before.
[09:12.12]That's a lot.
[09:15.03]Like, 20, 30, 40, 50 subs, 100 subs.
[09:17.69]That's fucking a lot of money.
[09:22.69]It's... I can't even believe people would do it.
[09:25.85]Thanks so much for fucking doing it.
[09:28.43]That was a humble brag.
[09:29.35]No, no, that's me saying, like, I looked at my bank account after doing it and went, holy fucking shit, that's a lot of money.
[09:43.31]But thanks, Freddy.
[09:44.25]And I'm just like, I'm shocked that people want to give me that kind of money.
[09:47.85]That's what I'm saying.
[09:48.69]Thank you.
[09:50.13]Flex, flex, flex.
[09:52.87]I just did it, and it wasn't even on camera, but you know what I did?
[09:54.87]I did, you saw it in your head.
[10:01.93]I didn't even need to do it on camera.
[10:03.95]My fist went up, my fucking boink, I went like that, you know, like boink.
[10:08.27]Alright, I gotta fucking play.
[10:11.52]Alright, I need weed.
[10:13.10]Six grams of weed.

[10:25.07]I do.
[10:25.53]I need six grams.

[10:34.77]What do I have?
[10:35.25]Okay, so now I need... What do I need?
[10:36.65]Amphetamines and MDMA?
[10:38.08]MDMA?
[10:40.45]I remember when this was a wholesome Twitch channel.
[10:42.15]Not anymore.
[10:43.27]I've activated the mature audience filter.
[10:46.70]That means that if you click on this stream, you are agreeing that you are a mature audience member.
[10:51.40]It has been activated.
[10:54.46]What?
[10:57.02]Why do I keep thinking this shit is happening in my real fucking place?
[11:01.49]I was like, are we being invaded?
[11:04.49]What the fuck is going on?
[11:12.65]I, I, like, what am I supposed to, I keep thinking this stuff is real.
[11:15.75]Alright, we have six grams of marijuana.

[12:22.39]Amphetamine.
[12:23.19]One pack of ecstasy.
[12:23.93]One pack of new, new sugar mix.
[12:29.13]And then $70.

[12:39.62]I need $16 more.
[12:46.19]Alright, 16 of MDMA.

[12:52.75]Mike Byers?
[12:54.02]Oh, right.
[12:54.34]I just bought a place.
[12:55.14]Alright, I'm ready to take all these.
[12:56.14]Here we go.
[12:56.50]Gonna make some money here.
[13:04.68]That's my dealer, right?
[13:05.70]Yeah.
[13:05.80]What are my skill points again?
[13:14.96]Illusionist.
[13:17.73]So what's the actual percentage?
[13:22.91]What's the actual percentage?
[13:25.79]What do you mean Bernie in chat?
[13:27.47]Bernie Sanders in chat?
[13:31.57]The real Bernie's in chat.
[13:33.13]I don't think so.
[13:34.39]I don't believe so.
[13:35.98]I don't think so.
[13:37.00]I really don't believe so.
[13:40.76]No, it's probably a fake name.
[13:46.34]It's a fake name.
[13:47.86]Alright, I got a delivery.
[13:49.33]It's because somebody gifted him a sub.
[13:53.81]Yeah, alright.
[13:57.93]That trick only works a handful of times, guys, before you sub every single game developer to me.
[14:04.50]Every major Twitch broadcaster.
[14:07.18]And like 5 out of 10 of the celebrities I've talked about.
[14:12.03]Like, holy shit, dude.
[14:13.05]Wait, Jim Carrey was here?
[14:14.65]At Jim Carrey.
[14:16.99]He's got a sub, dude.
[14:18.27]He's fucking subbed.
[14:21.05]What?
[14:21.33]Jim Carrey subbed me?
[14:24.86]There's only so many times you can play that joke before I know.
[14:28.58]Alright, I'm looking for the police.
[14:31.48]Alright, we're good.
[14:36.64]Nope.
[14:39.75]But he doesn't know.
[14:41.17]No, I know.
[14:42.45]I do know.
[14:43.86]I got... Where's the dealer?
[14:49.02]He wanted two grams of amphetamines.
[14:52.36]One two-gram pack.
[14:54.46]Thank you, sir.
[15:00.18]$24.
[15:00.30]Oh, dude.
[15:01.12]Didn't you know every celebrity you've ever heard of all subscribes to you?
[15:07.35]Two grams of amphetamines.
[15:08.37]You got it.
[15:13.54]Oh shit.
[15:14.38]They don't see me, right?
[15:15.14]No.
[15:16.24]Alright, I gotta go across the street.
[15:22.84]Real Taylor Swift.
[15:27.52]Holy shit.
[15:28.40]I can't believe real Taylor Swift.
[15:32.24]And then... Hey, Super Frog!
[15:36.12]Thank you, Super Bruce.
[15:37.46]For the 20 subs.
[15:38.60]This is just back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back subs.
[15:42.86]Thanks for the 20 subs, dude.
[15:44.24]Seriously.
[15:44.68]That's so much money.
[15:49.33]That's so much money.
[15:51.47]Thank you, Superrog.
[15:57.93]Oh, thanks, Bruce.
[15:59.39]Oh, this is the big one.
[15:59.95]This is 16.
[16:00.65]16 grams.
[16:02.93]Take it.
[16:03.66]There you go.
[16:05.06]And I got you right next to you, Donald.
[16:09.22]You wanted the 6 grams of marijuana.
[16:12.32]There you are.
[16:12.98]I'm almost at level... What was it?
[16:14.32]Level 8?
[16:14.87]Level 10?
[16:15.01]I've done almost all of them.
[16:18.80]Can you fast travel or something?
[16:27.02]One of these days, somebody's actually gonna be here.
[16:28.74]One of these days, somebody's actually gonna click on this fucking shitty stream.
[16:33.21]Because somebody, like, linked them.
[16:35.23]And they're gonna just... They're gonna show up.
[16:37.73]And it... What?
[16:39.53]No.
[16:40.73]No.
[16:42.10]Well, yeah.
[16:43.28]Let me finish my thought.
[16:45.24]Like... Hey, dude.
[16:46.76]Oh, Taylor Swift.
[16:47.98]Check out this streamer.
[16:49.44]Oh, he's so cool.
[16:51.16]And they're gonna get her and I'm just gonna be going...
[16:56.33]And this is what happens when you make a fucking joke.
[16:58.81]This is what happens.
[16:59.39]This is what I deserve.
[17:04.81]Where's my house?
[17:09.22]Where's my house?
[17:09.74]Oh my god.
[17:15.11]Long story short, there ain't no fucking celebrities here.
[17:17.39]There's no one here.
[17:18.85]Nobody's here.
[17:19.47]It's just you.
[17:20.11]It's just you and me.
[17:21.03]We're the only two people that are here.
[17:22.26]It's just us, and I just lost the money that I just sold.
[17:24.92]It's just, like, us 5,000 people.
[17:27.48]There ain't no celebrities.
[17:28.67]There's, like, Bobby Flay's not here, guys, okay?
[17:31.09]It's okay.
[17:39.37]See, right now, somewhere in sunny California, Bobby Flay is in his pajamas, sitting there watching Jerma985 going, oh, shit.
[17:51.34]Nobody thinks it's real.
[17:52.92]That's alright.
[17:53.88]Holy shit, though.
[17:55.46]Wow.
[17:56.26]That was almost bad.
[17:57.02]I can't fucking believe I lost everything.
[18:14.09]That was going so well.
[18:18.96]God damn it.
[18:20.78]What do these guys want?
[18:21.60]At least I got the ecstasy to the dealer though.
[18:24.84]That's the good thing.
[18:28.54]That was a Family Guy joke.
[18:29.94]No, that was a Jeremy Elbertson joke because I just said it.
[18:34.28]Just because Family Guy goes like, hey, wouldn't it be funny if... Doesn't mean anybody else can go, hey, wouldn't it be funny if...
[18:41.13]Family Guy has not tarnished the wouldn't it be funny if scenario.
[18:44.35]I refuse to believe that.
[18:45.19]And if they did, then that's a sad day.
[18:53.41]Alright, let's go back to the house.
[18:59.16]Oh, now everyone can say F. Oh, now everyone can say F. F's in the chat, huh?
[19:03.92]That's so funny.
[19:05.44]It's hysterical when people do F's in the chat.
[19:10.01]Oh, he's getting fibered.
[19:11.55]Wait.
[19:12.23]Wait, what?
[19:16.83]I knew I should.
[19:17.75]I did all those tests.
[19:19.01]I shouldn't have done that.
[19:20.15]I shouldn't have done that.
[19:21.07]I shouldn't have done that.
[19:21.91]It's alright.
[19:23.79]I changed servers.
[19:25.21]I shouldn't have done that.
[19:26.43]I knew it.
[19:27.23]I shouldn't have done it.
[19:28.31]Which one of these is my house?
[19:42.11]See, I was doing, through the VPN, I was just testing different servers.
[19:46.89]Which ones?
[19:47.31]Hey, let's try this one.
[19:48.52]Let's see what the speeds on this one are.
[19:50.48]And I changed it.
[19:51.34]And I was like, yeah, that one looks good.
[19:53.60]And I was fine.
[19:54.64]I don't know why I changed the server.
[19:55.86]It was my own fault.
[19:56.60]But it's fine.
[19:57.08]Alright, I still have plenty of drugs.
[19:59.28]Don't worry.
[19:59.90]Did we just get more money coming?
[20:01.56]Are you feeling the burn?
[20:03.14]Thanks for the five community subs.
[20:05.10]And sweaty man, thanks for five community subs.
[20:11.55]Using a VPN.
[20:12.69]Yeah.
[20:13.69]And it works perfectly good.
[20:21.50]But I, I, what, why, why is this such a problem?
[20:26.31]No, I'm not streaming with that.
[20:27.75]I'm not streaming with the one that people get paid to use.
[20:31.07]Okay?
[20:31.34]It's a different one.
[20:32.38]And it's a secret.
[20:33.94]Because, I don't know.
[20:34.84]I like having... I don't know.
[20:36.46]I have my virtual private fucking station.
[20:40.72]Whatever it is.
[20:47.35]VPS.
[20:49.15]What?
[20:51.63]I don't use that one.
[20:53.13]No, that's not the one.
[20:54.25]I don't use that one.
[21:01.88]No, I don't use that one.
[21:03.31]Stop saying that.
[21:04.05]You're going to get me in trouble.
[21:05.25]And I don't want to get in trouble.
[21:06.89]I don't want to get in trouble.
[21:08.17]I've done... No.
[21:13.22]That's that one.
[21:14.12]No, it's not.
[21:14.62]Alright.
[21:15.60]You guys are distracting the fuck out of me today.
[21:18.40]I got arrested because you were distracting me.
[21:21.80]That's a real drug deal.
[21:24.29]Like that.
[21:27.07]Hey, you got the stuff?
[21:28.11]Yeah, I got the stuff.
[21:29.77]Alright, hey, shh, yeah, come over here.
[21:31.07]What, uh, what do I owe you?
[21:32.67]You owe me, uh, hold on a second, I got a phone call.
[21:35.11]Hey!
[21:36.05]Hey!
[21:36.85]Hey, imagine, imagine if Bobby Flay was, was calling me right now.
[21:41.87]Hey, doot doot doot doot, Bobby Flay.
[21:44.07]Hey, it's me, Bobby Flay.
[21:45.19]Can you imagine, dude?
[21:46.91]No, I think it's my mom.
[21:48.01]Hey, can we just, like, get this over with and... Whoa, I hear the hole, I think I hear the police, man.
[21:51.99]Hey, woo, woo, we're over here!
[21:56.11]Imagine if they came over here after I yelled at them.
[21:58.35]Hey, look at this.
[21:58.81]Hey, have you ever seen somebody do a stance like this?
[22:00.81]And you do like a fucking look at me.
[22:06.41]That person does not keep going.
[22:19.66]I can't figure out if this is a -2 or a +2.
[22:21.88]You don't have to figure it out at all.
[22:23.24]Just fucking watch the TV.
[22:28.10]Why do we have so many fucking comedy detectives in here?
[22:33.71]Just watch the television.
[22:36.65]I'm trying to figure out if I liked that or not.
[22:40.15]Let me do some math.
[22:47.89]Alright, let's put this down.
[22:53.56]Wait, let me check the TV.
[22:54.86]It's a laptop.
[22:59.95]Nobody, right?
[23:00.57]I got, at least I got it off to her.
[23:02.91]This is the important one.
[23:08.62]I have nothing.
[23:09.06]Did I just sleep?
[23:14.24]No offense, but I think the look at me thing is really dumb.
[23:16.26]Me too.
[23:18.44]It's the only thing that pays the bills nowadays, okay?
[23:21.12]So just give me, just let me do it every now and then, man.
[23:23.89]Come on.
[23:32.52]Come on, man.
[23:34.38]All I got are three words.
[23:35.66]Look at me and the spider one.
[23:40.12]Shut the fuck up, man.
[23:41.28]You're trying to ruin this for me.
[23:47.66]Take this out.
[23:53.38]I need new clients.
[23:54.58]I need my... Did they take the bag too?
[23:57.16]Please don't tell me they took the bag.
[23:58.26]Okay, thank God.
[24:00.20]Hey, Justice Nugget, thanks for the five community subs.
[24:03.62]And what does he say every time he gets five community subs?
[24:06.25]He says, look at me.
[24:11.89]Thanks, though.
[24:12.65]Jesus Christ.
[24:14.11]Balance, thanks for the five subs.
[24:15.97]And Justice Nugget, thanks for the five subs.
[24:18.25]I have to give these free samples away to people.
[24:28.18]Check this out.
[24:30.15]Until I get my drug deal.
[24:31.37]What are the tasks?
[24:34.74]I need five addicts.
[24:37.56]Check out the furniture shop.
[24:38.42]I already did that.
[24:39.70]Two grams of ecstasy, two grams of ecstasy.
[24:41.68]Two grams of adiphenamine, two grams of ecstasy.
[24:43.30]I have that.
[24:44.86]Okay, thank God.
[24:45.62]Didn't take everything.
[24:50.68]Store this.
[24:51.78]Actually, keep a little bit out.
[24:57.13]Oh, this is the mixed up shit.
[24:58.43]This is the thing you guys are all screaming.
[24:59.69]Wait a minute.
[24:59.99]This is not even ecstasy.
[25:01.01]I just faked myself out.
[25:03.25]This is the fake shit.
[25:04.77]And I just thought it was real.
[25:06.37]That means it's good.
[25:07.01]I'll keep the marijuana.
[25:09.29]Put the money away.
[25:14.17]I want to break this up.
[25:20.62]Let's put that on here.
[25:25.36]Alright, here we go.
[25:25.78]Finally.
[25:26.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[25:26.78]Stop, stop, stop.
[25:27.62]I hate F. Everybody else, like, hate F where E should be.
[25:32.76]You know what I mean?
[25:33.71]I feel like that's not just me.
[25:42.90]F, F, F. Oh, no.
[25:44.42]No.
[25:53.37]Okay, you wanted to put the rest of this shit away.
[25:56.53]Um... No, put... I gotta... I'm just gonna... Can I just, like, throw this in the trash?
[26:07.26]How do you get rid of... How do you get rid of drugs?
[26:11.59]I know this is not, like, looking up, like, how to dispose of a battery.
[26:14.97]Right?
[26:15.19]Like, how do you... How do you get rid of batteries?
[26:18.17]But still, like, what are you... What am I supposed to do?
[26:23.68]Okay, put this away.
[26:29.36]I want enough to give a couple samples out.
[26:30.96]Alright, let's go.
[26:33.72]I'm gonna get fucking arrested again.
[26:37.65]You cook a steak with it.
[26:38.87]You eat them.
[26:40.69]You don't waste them.
[26:42.69]You don't waste... Did you hear that?
[26:45.43]That was like... I can't even do that again.
[26:47.55]Yes, I do.
[26:47.87]I have a backpack on.
[26:48.55]That was like a full-on, like...
[26:54.11]Wow, that was... I can't even replicate that.
[26:55.97]Let's go.
[27:00.61]Is this thing bugged, though?
[27:04.66]Because remember I went in the furniture shop last time?
[27:06.52]Why is it not doing it?
[27:07.72]Alright, here we go.
[27:18.07]Free sample.
[27:20.43]Hey.
[27:22.14]I have a free present for you.
[27:24.18]It's one pack of marijuana.
[27:26.48]Try it on the house.
[27:29.00]I have something for you too.
[27:31.79]I have a one gram pack of amphetamines.
[27:35.67]You know what?
[27:39.57]Take two.
[27:39.99]Go ahead, take two.
[27:44.44]Share.
[27:53.94]There we go.
[27:55.20]Finally.
[27:58.28]I have to be getting close to the next level, right?
[28:02.98]Making drug addicts.
[28:04.25]I mean, that's the best point of the game.
[28:05.63]Hey, you clicked the mature content thing.
[28:07.59]VR, you can be here.
[28:09.89]I wanted two grand back to see.
[28:11.43]Okay.
[28:12.41]Put that over there.
[28:13.53]Okay.
[28:17.96]Watch out for the police.
[28:29.17]What did you want?
[28:29.71]Two grams of amphetamines?
[28:30.67]Yep.
[28:32.52]Okay.
[28:36.76]Why do I sound weird?
[28:37.80]I don't know.
[28:39.72]I shouldn't.
[28:41.08]I sound weird?
[28:42.23]Is it a one guy scenario?
[28:43.83]What if he failed?
[28:48.05]I just gave it to him.
[28:57.62]Oh, I don't sound weird.
[28:59.22]It's the game.
[29:03.90]It's the fucking game.
[29:05.63]The game is playing twice.
[29:10.41]Right.
[29:11.63]Because, sorry, I turned off my computer and turned it back on and opened the GoXLR app, which resets my settings every single time I open this program.
[29:25.06]I don't know why this happens every single time.
[29:28.91]Just save?
[29:29.61]Why do I have to?
[29:30.29]Why can't I just?
[29:30.95]Why can't I just save?
[29:31.91]Do I have to make like a full-on new?
[29:34.61]I'm on the demo.
[29:36.09]Why would I make a new profile or something?
[29:38.17]What the fuck?
[29:41.19]Come on.
[29:51.32]There you go.
[29:58.79]I will tell you though... I mean, you guys probably know this by now.
[30:04.05]If there's ever a product that you hear me talk about that I like... Get it as fast as you can.
[30:10.23]Because that means it's good.
[30:11.45]And it's real.
[30:12.13]And I actually mean it.
[30:15.93]So I'm serious.
[30:16.81]Because everything I use, I just go, this sucks.
[30:20.68]This is stupid.
[30:22.36]This product is terrible.
[30:24.70]Do I like anything?
[30:29.87]Have I been satisfied with any products I've ever purchased?
[30:35.85]What was the last time I was satisfied fully with a product?
[30:38.93]Where I was like, man, I'm McDonald's.
[30:41.31]Yeah, but... Okay.
[30:48.20]Okay, that's true.
[30:50.04]So go get McDonald's, I guess.
[30:53.98]That's the only thing that satisfies me.
[30:57.62]That's fucking ridiculous.
[31:00.91]Yeah, I mean, I can't think of one time where I've been like, oh, McDonald's, fucking, this, McDonald's, like, sucks.
[31:06.81]This thing sucks.
[31:08.01]I haven't said that in a long time.
[31:09.57]Well, actually, that's not true.
[31:12.07]McDonald's, it depends on what McDonald's, right?
[31:15.19]Because, like, they differ in quality.
[31:17.92]One McDonald's could be a zero, and another McDonald's could be a six.
[31:22.50]And they both serve the exact same menu.
[31:24.52]So that's hard to determine.
[31:29.13]You could go to a 9 out of 10 McDonald's and be like, wow, this is amazing.
[31:32.31]And then you go to a 0 McDonald's and it's just like they threw together the lettuce and they didn't even fold it correctly.
[31:39.23]The bun is like soggy and off to the side and fucked up and the thing's cold.
[31:43.79]It's the same food.
[31:45.31]That happens.
[31:50.56]He's a picky eater.
[31:51.34]What?
[31:53.86]No, that happens.
[31:54.60]The soggy lettuce and the bun off to the side.
[31:56.94]Like, come on.
[31:59.06]Whenever I open it up and the bun is like wet and off to the side, don't you just go like... I do that.
[32:15.93]Alright, we got to do seven grams of speed.
[32:18.68]I have it.
[32:20.78]Here we go.
[32:21.14]Money.
[32:21.26]This is going to be a big buy.
[32:24.12]How close am I to the next stage here?
[32:31.01]I'm almost at stink.
[32:32.05]I need 800 respect.
[32:34.51]Crystal meth is the next thing.
[32:36.29]Oh, boy.
[32:36.77]When do we get crack?
[32:41.37]You were one of those mac and cheese and hot dog kids every day, huh?
[32:47.21]Wow.
[32:47.65]How wrong could somebody be?
[32:50.01]It was Captain Crunch.
[32:51.68]Get it right.
[32:56.54]Okay.
[32:57.10]Let's go.
[32:57.94]I have
[33:00.17]Any more deals?
[33:01.69]No, I just need amphetamines.
[33:03.87]I need more amphetamines.
[33:05.03]Should I just mix some of this shit together?
[33:06.55]What do you want, seven?
[33:09.81]Shit.
[33:13.95]Okay, well, I'm gonna have to give this guy junk.
[33:17.09]Does this even have amphetamines in it?
[33:19.00]You know it's bad when you don't even know if there's even 1% amphetamines in this.
[33:24.02]The dry rub has it, right?
[33:32.16]It's getting dry, Rub.
[33:39.25]What's that command?
[33:48.58]Oh.
[33:49.78]It's a fart command.
[33:58.05]How do I stamp a giant, like, notary stamp on this chatroom with -2 right now?
[34:04.57]How do I do that?
[34:06.13]Can I do that?
[34:10.10]Well, you get to do it to me.
[34:10.88]No, no, I didn't want to change scenes.
[34:16.37]I wanted to...
[34:26.45]Here.
[34:26.59]Let's see how you like it.
[34:27.85]Let's see how you guys like this.
[34:35.10]When you look at the screen, this is all I see when I look at the screen.
[34:39.69]This is all you see when you look at the screen.
[35:02.33]It's blurry?
[35:03.73]Well, sorry.
[35:04.92]OBS apparently doesn't have vector-based graphics.
[35:07.98]Maybe I should ring him up and ask him.
[35:12.48]Oh, he knows what vector-based graphics is?
[35:14.26]I thought he was stupid.
[35:17.37]I gotta rethink everything.
[35:18.35]$180.
[35:19.21]Late.
[35:33.93]I don't want any drugs on me.
[35:35.57]You wanted the seven.
[35:36.37]Okay, he's gonna hate this, but I'm sorry, dude.
[35:38.68]Just take the dry rub and whatever.
[35:40.40]Bye.
[35:42.42]That's it?
[35:48.36]Anti-ali- Alright, fine.
[35:50.31]You learned your lesson.
[35:51.19]None of you did.
[35:53.07]None of you did.
[35:54.89]Not one person did.
[35:56.01]Okay, 378 bucks.
[35:57.45]I got five points.
[35:58.09]Where's it going?
[36:06.11]Ah, fresh coffee.
[36:09.75]I like coffee, right?
[36:14.43]I can't do illusion.
[36:15.11]I need six.
[36:20.57]I love coffee.
[36:23.86]I'm going to say either quick learner or I'm doing quick learner.
[36:30.86]I want more experience.
[36:36.38]Yeah.
[36:38.30]EXP is good.
[36:41.68]Now I just have to unlock the new area.
[36:44.88]Save the thing.
[36:46.28]Maybe one day.
[36:46.80]Alright, let's go... Back to the house.
[36:53.63]Save the line.
[37:17.33]Sorry, I phone-vibrated that to you.
[37:19.27]Did you get it?
[37:33.70]We need to enhance it.
[37:38.50]Wait, what did he say there?
[37:40.28]Zoom in a little.
[37:43.97]A little more.
[37:44.39]10% more.
[37:50.05]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[37:52.43]There it is.
[37:53.01]Yes, I knew it.
[37:58.67]He does still love us.
[38:08.80]Liar.
[38:13.56]After ten years.
[38:14.82]I heard you sell.
[38:18.98]Candy.
[38:20.42]I need four grams.
[38:22.38]Sure.
[38:22.80]Delivering soon.
[38:30.06]That's all I have.
[38:31.21]I should probably get a...
[38:35.17]Can I send this to a lab and find out what was in it?
[38:38.53]What's in this?
[38:42.70]I don't know what's in here.
[38:47.72]I need to get a pill press.
[38:48.82]I don't have access to it yet.
[38:56.12]This was sugar and ecstasy.
[39:00.46]Okay.
[39:02.08]Just find out.
[39:05.18]This was ecstasy and dry rub.
[39:07.26]Why does dry rub have to be in everything?
[39:10.10]Alright, one gram of ecstasy.

[66:03.60]Hey, I know you're having a lot of fun playing the drug dealer game.
[66:07.62]Dealing drugs.
[66:09.42]What's going on with this flat Earth, huh?
[66:15.07]Well, let me tell you.
[66:22.13]You have proof that the Earth is round.
[66:26.69]Do I?
[66:28.07]Do I have proof?
[66:30.96]Do I have proof?
[66:32.60]Me.
[66:33.50]Jeremy.
[66:34.52]Like sitting in my office.
[66:35.92]Do I have proof that the Earth is round?
[66:42.22]Of course I do.
[66:46.52]You don't think I fucking did my research on this?
[66:54.58]It's called... Be in Ecuador and jump.
[67:02.46]I bet you land on the ground.
[67:27.12]I don't have anything.
[67:27.70]I don't have anything.
[67:28.26]I don't have anything.
[67:28.80]I don't have anything.
[67:37.86]Look, you want to know why I think the Earth is round?
[67:42.49]It's easy.
[67:44.27]Because the dinosaurs, when they were here, a meteor hit the fucking Earth.
[67:51.83]Okay?
[67:52.89]That means there had to be enough gravity on...
[67:58.33]On the moon... I've got... Hold on.
[68:01.62]I've got to... I've got to put the fucking spray paint down.
[68:03.52]The fumes are fucking on my head.

[82:54.71]Just keep selling it?
[83:00.29]Just even if it's like, oh, this stuff sucks.
[83:02.67]Just buy one, 10 grams of amphetamine and stretch it to 100.
[83:06.91]That's kind of what I did last time when people got really mad at me.
[83:19.57]Two grams of ecstasy.

[84:51.46]I'm gonna make it look nice.
[84:52.34]We're gonna label this shit.
[84:57.97]By the way, I'm going to do this same shit on the Easy Bake Oven stream because there's like 20 recipes I'm going to be making.
[85:12.63]By the way, on the Easy Bake Oven stream, I'm going to make a bunch of drugs.
[85:15.73]I'm going to be making drugs on the Easy Bake Oven.
[85:17.72]I got to figure out how to do this the right way.

[89:42.19]One pack of new, new sugar mix mix.
[89:47.35]Should I just dump it all over here and have like just a bunch of trash?
[89:50.93]This is just trash.

[98:07.56]This is diluted powder, but I need to... It's... This is amphetamine.
[98:15.46]I know, but fuck.
[98:16.56]I can't... Okay, that's amphetamine.
[98:18.84]We're going to add to it.
[98:21.28]We'll do washing powder this time.
[98:22.49]We're going to do a little kick of washing powder.
[98:27.47]Maybe some silica gel.
[98:31.35]Oh no, it's diluted.
[98:42.98]Just fucking... Just fucking snort the whole counter.
[98:51.30]I don't know why that's making me laugh.
[99:15.44]I can't.
[99:15.88]I can't.
[99:16.36]I can't.
[99:16.90]I can't.
[99:17.34]I can't.
[99:19.73]I can't.
[99:20.95]Alright, let's... This is 9.7... 9.97.
[99:25.89]Let's add some washing powder.
[99:30.10]I'm gonna add 3 grams of washing powder.
[99:35.66]Can you really do 350?
[99:36.34]Can I just dump the whole box?
[99:38.36]Can I eat like 10 boxes?
[99:45.18]Can I just cover my desk with baking soda?
[99:54.23]How much is it?
[99:54.85]Oh, no.
[99:55.25]30 grams is the max capacity there.
[100:00.31]I guess I could just put it in bags and just make a desk out of baking soda.
[100:04.72]I don't want to spend the time.
[100:08.42]That's a taking.
[100:09.60]That would take like an hour.
[100:15.62]That would take an hour.
[100:16.74]I can't do it.
[100:17.70]Okay, let's put this over here.
[100:23.55]So mix.
[100:27.65]It's a little bit of amphetamine and washing powder.
[100:30.09]Okay.
[100:31.49]Now we're going to mix it up.
[100:42.29]Okay.
[100:45.50]Oh, I'm sorry.
[100:46.08]One of my teeth just fell out.
[100:47.30]I had to do something about it.
[100:54.72]Uh, package.
[100:55.16]12 packets.
[100:57.37]Okay, keep going.
[101:10.63]My eyes are itchy.
[101:12.69]I just get itchy eyes for no reason.
[101:17.01]And then when you itch them, it makes them worse.
[101:19.75]Just way worse.
[101:23.04]Sometimes I'll slightly itch my eye, and I know I'm not supposed to.
[101:27.96]And then when I start touching my eye, it heightens the itchiness by 10,000%.
[101:34.51]And then you're like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[101:37.79]Itch, itch, itch, itch, itch, itch, itch.
[101:40.29]And you can't stop it, and it will not go away.
[101:47.32]Don't tell him.
[101:48.00]What?
[101:53.89]Mix the amphetamines with the weed.
[101:55.21]I don't think I can.
[101:56.03]I have to powder it.
[101:59.71]Wait, what?
[102:02.81]Oh, the sink.
[102:03.98]I can put these in the sink, right?
[102:05.06]Okay, hold on.
[102:05.76]I'm going to put them in the sink.
[102:06.68]I'm going to try this.
[102:16.74]No bottles to... Oh, wait!
[102:18.04]Uh, take one of these bottles.
[102:27.15]How do I pick it up?
[102:31.23]I want to pick one of these up.
[102:35.07]Uh, how do I put it in my inventory?
[102:41.15]Can I not pick this up anymore?
[102:51.99]Okay, no, I just have to walk away.
[102:53.55]Alright, let's fill this jar up with water.
[102:55.69]No bottles found in inventory.
[102:56.85]What the fuck are you talking about?
[102:59.69]What?
[103:06.64]How do I fill up a bottle?
[103:08.54]I need a water bottle?
[103:11.10]What?
[103:15.96]It's a jar?
[103:16.66]It's a container.
[103:17.46]It can hold water?
[103:22.59]Alright, so now, this is, let's mix this up.
[103:35.70]It's a game.
[103:36.36]He's pretending.
[103:42.77]I, what, you can't put water into a jar?
[103:48.01]I didn't, sorry, I didn't know that the game didn't want me to get like a bottle of, like a water bottle.
[103:52.77]Okay.
[104:00.32]I have.
[104:02.54]I now am the owner.
[104:06.10]Of.
[104:09.88]Let's see.
[104:11.52]Just throw this in the trash.
[104:18.49]What do I got?
[104:18.89]I still don't know why I own this.
[104:24.40]Okay, let's put the silica gel.
[104:25.64]Let's put this shit out of here so I don't look at it.
[104:30.00]Okay, silica gel.
[104:34.32]Silica gel.
[104:36.34]Okay, here it is.
[104:36.98]Diluted.
[104:39.02]Diluted mix?
[104:41.05]Marijuana bag.
[104:42.61]Diluted mix.
[104:46.11]New, new sugar mix.
[104:47.62]I have 29 of these.
[104:48.84]And then fake ex- Okay.
[104:50.50]But I don't have a pill thing.
[104:51.56]And everyone got mad at me because I did this.
[104:53.70]Might as well add like 50% salt to it.
[105:01.67]Oh, washing powder.
[105:03.41]Just mix everything.
[105:08.05]Guys, this is not...
[105:10.44]This is dangerous drugs.
[105:13.64]This is not when you were six and you were making potions in the bathroom.
[105:19.41]Take two tablespoons of shampoo and then mouthwash and mix it up with this and then add a little bit of water and then shaving cream.
[105:29.78]If you didn't do that, I don't believe you.
[105:32.78]This is not what this is.
[105:33.56]You don't just make a magic potion in your bathroom.
[105:44.16]This is less dangerous than doing that.
[105:49.48]What?
[105:52.06]Putting like a little squeeze of toothpaste in a small cup and like a little bit of shaving cream and a little drop of shampoo and mixing it up and saying I'm making magic potions.
[106:05.40]What's wrong with that?
[106:08.35]This is less dangerous.
[106:18.82]I just...
[106:37.57]You could have made... No, I wouldn't.
[106:43.11]Where do I... Where am I getting this bleach?
[106:45.76]Like, fucking ammonia.
[106:47.10]I wasn't allowed to have, like, aerosol cans, guys.
[106:50.62]What are you talking about?
[106:51.42]What do you think my, like...
[106:53.25]Hey, sit down here.
[106:54.38]So you wanna make magic potions?
[106:56.08]Alright.
[106:56.82]Here's some bleach.
[106:58.28]Here's a couple of cigarette butts.
[107:01.16]And a full glass of whiskey, ammonia, and the spray duster that I spray my computer with.
[107:08.34]Don't hold that upside down.
[107:09.88]Wink, wink, wink, and spray.
[107:11.24]Are you serious?
[107:13.34]What are you talking about?
[107:14.70]We're talking about toothpaste and like water.
[107:22.92]I think I'm making some awful dangerous chemical mix.
[107:26.14]I was having fun as a kid.
[107:27.91]Oh, by the way, I know how much you love whipped cream.
[107:33.81]There's four of them.
[107:37.57]He just turned it upside down.
[107:44.87]Have fun.
[107:52.51]he's gone toothpaste and like a little bit of shampoo and maybe maybe like a fucking conditioner or something and by the way I was holding in my shit the whole time while I was doing this
[108:24.96]I'm like when I'm talking about when I would do this it was like I was I was like purposely holding because I would okay hey remember that remember that therapy session that we were going to do I was going to go to like a therapist and talk about this stuff and we're going to do that on stream maybe I should save this
[108:54.08]I used to be like, I wanna, alright, I'm gonna keep going.
[108:59.66]No, I'm not done!
[109:01.37]Jeremy, are you alright in there?
[109:04.05]Yeah, I haven't gone yet.
[109:06.77]What, are you gonna go?
[109:07.63]Yep.
[109:09.15]Well, you better hurry, come on, hurry up.
[109:11.45]Okay.
[109:11.75]A little bit of shampoo, and then a little bit of toothpaste.
[109:17.01]What are you doing in there?
[109:17.91]Uh, nothing, making, uh, potions.
[109:22.59]Have you gone to the bathroom yet?
[109:23.77]Uh, yes.
[109:26.33]Are you sure?
[109:26.95]No, yes.
[109:29.05]Leave me alone.
[109:32.11]It's been four hours.
[109:37.61]Why was that fact important?
[109:40.03]I don't know, because that's important to know.
[109:43.44]I'm an open book, okay?
[109:45.20]Each page is... I'm going to tell you.
[109:50.21]Alright, I got like 30 grams of fucking baking soda shit.
[109:53.34]Let's... Delivery.
[109:58.62]Childhood.
[109:59.12]Yeah, it was like a childhood story.
[110:01.68]I was like fucking eight.
[110:06.54]Ooh, got money.
[110:07.40]Wait.
[110:09.54]I still... I don't understand this.
[110:12.71]Am I not old enough for this?
[110:14.47]Or am I not high enough for this?
[110:23.37]You gotta buy them from the shops.
[110:25.08]Oh.
[110:29.10]Alright, I'm gonna do it during police hours.
[110:31.60]Fuck it, as they say.
[110:32.46]This is the most transparent streamer.
[110:36.63]Too transparent, maybe.
[110:37.91]Alright, give me my money.
[110:42.27]We need... We got another dealer.
[110:46.25]I have three dealers now.
[110:47.33]Alright, cool.
[110:48.16]But what happens?
[110:49.76]So I'm going to run out of people to sell to and just have a bunch of dealers.
[110:53.90]Alright, six grams of amps.
[110:56.82]This is, what are you, four grams of amps.
[110:59.24]This is two grams of ecstasy.
[111:01.18]Alright, we got a lot of amps.
[111:04.64]You want two ecstasy.
[111:07.62]And then we have ten amps.
[111:09.64]Two ecstasy, ten amp.
[111:16.92]Okay.
[111:20.30]Two ecstasy, ten amp.
[111:30.00]Alright, one pack of new diluted mix.
[111:33.74]Okay, let's just take this.
[111:37.06]Only what we need.
[111:38.02]You dummy.
[111:42.18]What is it?
[111:42.56]New diluted mix?
[111:45.33]What the fuck is the difference?
[111:51.10]We're gonna start labeling these better.
[111:52.37]Alright, let's go.
[111:56.47]Two, ecstasy, and then ten, and then you just get money.
[111:59.72]Alright, let's move.
[112:01.44]One of them has washing powder in it.
[112:02.94]Oh, right.
[112:03.58]Shit.
[112:05.40]Shit.
[112:05.50]Shit.
[112:11.49]This is important.
[112:12.53]I have to address this.
[112:14.63]Let me get this straight.
[112:15.99]As a kid, you made potions while you took a shit.
[112:18.29]As a teenager, you brought your entire desktop computer into the bathroom with you.
[112:22.95]And as an adult, you do poop stretches.
[112:25.17]Your bathroom habits are fucked.
[112:33.62]I've told this story plenty of times, but...
[112:36.85]It seemed like bringing my whole computer into the bathroom.
[112:40.03]I would sit there.
[112:41.03]Although there's probably some new viewers.
[112:42.53]I'll just TL;DR this whole thing.
[112:45.55]I would bring my entire computer into the bathroom.
[112:49.17]And a little wobbly table.
[112:53.06]And I would plug everything in and I would set everything up and I would sit there and take a shit and play video games.
[113:00.60]And it was always such an insanely awesome idea.
[113:04.22]It was like the greatest thing ever.
[113:06.56]Until you were done.
[113:07.92]Because then it was just.
[113:10.76]I have to fucking dismount.
[113:12.75]How am I going to do this?
[113:14.97]And I was just trapped there.
[113:18.45]I couldn't even move.
[113:30.37]But, man, I'll tell you, like, it was... And I don't... I didn't think that was that weird.
[113:37.94]You know why that's not weird?
[113:39.42]I'll tell you a reason why.
[113:40.48]Let's go over this.
[113:41.23]I have to go over this.
[113:43.55]Listen to me.
[113:44.37]No, it's not weird.
[113:45.43]Listen.
[113:46.25]You gotta hear me out.
[113:48.36]What do you do when you go to go to do your business?
[113:52.69]You have a phone now and that phone has websites, games.
[113:57.09]Some of you guys have iPads as switches and you bring your switch and you just go to the bathroom and you sit there with your phone and you read your phone and you fucking play your switch.
[114:06.70]I didn't have that when I was younger.
[114:08.42]That was it's the same deal.
[114:10.54]I wanted to like play with my switch in the bathroom.
[114:16.26]You understand?
[114:16.92]I used to have to bring my fucking entire computer into the bathroom.
[114:20.72]You now have that in the Nintendo Switch.
[114:23.03]That's the reason why I bought it.
[114:25.69]It's my entire teenage childhood life just squished into a little box that I now, it's the best system that's ever been made.
[114:32.39]I sanitize.
[114:38.94]I sanitize.
[114:40.32]Excuse me.
[114:42.98]Do you guys act like I bring this thing in and go to the bathroom?
[114:46.38]I don't wipe my ass with the switch.
[114:51.08]Do you guys think I'm done?
[114:52.57]Well, I'm done.
[114:53.21]Let's turn the switch on its side and just drag it up my ass.
[114:58.81]No.
[115:00.21]I put it down before touching anything.
[115:04.72]I slide it under the door.
[115:07.74]It goes under the door into the bathroom.
[115:10.84]I haven't touched it.
[115:13.56]I clean outside wash the hands pick after drying the hands pick the switch up off the floor no not into the no not I'm saying I slide it like under the door like out I said into the bathroom
[115:40.58]Whoops.
[115:41.66]All these years I thought you're supposed to go to the bathroom outside the toilet.
[115:45.64]Wow.
[115:46.92]So that's why the bed smells so bad.
[115:49.08]Oh, I didn't know this.
[115:51.28]Oh, I'm just a dopey fucking screamer.
[115:53.88]I have no idea.
[115:58.87]I'm going to get arrested.
[116:00.13]Hold on.
[116:00.91]Not for that.
[116:01.91]There's nothing wrong with that.
[116:03.89]Okay.
[116:15.80]I slide it under the door.
[116:17.00]Or it's... Arrested for shitting on the bed.
[116:32.33]We got a call that somebody may have... You've gone to the bathroom in your bed?
[116:35.57]Yeah.
[116:38.07]You might take me away.
[116:54.53]Who the fuck are you?
[116:55.46]Wait, Illusion!
[117:06.77]Oh my fucking god.
[117:08.19]What's the point of putting points in that?
[117:21.16]What's the point of having fucking half my points in illusion?
[117:32.62]What did I even have on me?
[117:34.86]Not very much.
[117:38.72]180 fucking dollars, though.
[117:39.92]Great.
[117:44.35]Oh, what a fucking pain in the ass.
[117:46.41]Come on, really?
[117:47.05]Really?
[118:02.64]What if poop stretches?
[118:05.24]It's not even... I don't even know what they're talking about.
[118:09.50]You're scum for doing that.
[118:12.59]It's fine.
[118:15.49]Um... It's not... I don't know why people think this is so strange.
[118:21.62]It's... I think... I don't do, like, stretches before I go to the bathroom.
[118:29.11]I just make sure I've been walking around.
[118:33.27]Once I walk around for a bit, the pipes start moving and then I drink water.
[118:44.73]Let this topic go.
[118:46.45]I can't.
[118:47.79]It's very near and dear to my heart.
[118:54.82]Somebody gave $50. $50.
[118:58.00]You're basically a dog.
[119:00.26]And dogs are basically mammals.
[119:03.02]Isn't that interesting?
[119:07.94]So we're not that different.
[119:10.04]You and I. Dog.
[119:13.60]Alright, I did the exact same thing last time.
[119:15.14]I'm not going this way.
[119:15.80]Filactory Lich gave 5,000 bits.
[119:17.14]Thanks for the $50.
[119:17.75]That's huge money.
[119:25.51]They say, and then your legs would fall asleep and you wouldn't be able to stand up.
[119:29.14]I'm with you, Jerm.
[119:29.70]A computer poop was your night.
[119:31.00]Yes.
[119:33.41]Yes, that was always the indicator where it was time to get up.
[119:36.11]Because my legs would start to tingle and it would hurt and I'd be like, I have to get the fuck up.
[119:49.30]Or, you know, in some of the later years, when I had laptop capabilities, I could always tell because when I lifted up the laptop for some reason, the legs were red and they had like lines all over them and made them like hot.
[120:05.97]It was like, okay, it's probably time to get out of here.
[120:42.66]Hey, thank you.
[120:43.06]Dremel sucks.
[120:44.24]For the five community subs.
[120:52.26]I can't even get over here, man.
[120:53.16]There's cops everywhere.
[121:04.85]Alright.
[121:08.61]I have to deal drugs over here.
[121:10.65]There's a cop just standing here.
[121:22.05]He's a fugitive.
[121:26.12]Here, have you ever pooped upside down?
[121:29.78]Why the hell would anybody do that?
[121:34.98]Alright, there's somebody right here.
[121:41.99]Where's that cop?
[121:51.05]It's like right here, isn't he?
[121:56.20]Where is he?
[121:56.64]I can't see him.
[122:00.02]I thought that was... Okay.
[122:02.88]Why are you scary?
[122:06.20]Why are you scared?
[122:07.71]You don't need to be scared.
[122:13.37]True?
[122:13.73]What?
[122:14.61]True?
[122:15.55]True is what I went... Stupid!
[122:18.09]What?
[122:18.27]What?
[122:27.90]Don't let this guy go to the bathroom in your house.
[122:30.28]Why?
[122:30.82]He might take your whole computer into the bathroom?
[122:35.36]Hey, uh, hey man, where's your bathroom?
[122:38.34]Oh, it's right there on the right.
[122:39.58]Oh, cool.
[122:40.08]Where's your computer?
[122:42.16]It's on the left.
[122:43.32]Alright.
[122:52.97]Why did I scream so late?
[122:58.10]That was such a late scream.
[123:00.66]Oh, man!
[123:02.08]Go away!
[123:04.84]Fucking, I hate this!
[123:06.98]I hate this!
[123:07.98]I have to reload.
[123:10.85]Why were they all over there?
[123:12.23]Oh, wait, hey, which one of them was it?
[123:15.85]Which one was it?
[123:16.57]Hey!
[123:21.33]Oh, I think I found it!
[123:40.16]Alright, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna do this.
[123:44.20]I'm not going out there in the nighttime.
[123:46.51]No, I'm not going out there.
[123:48.99]You have to wait for your delivery.
[123:52.25]No, you don't.
[123:52.89]I'll get it right now.
[123:53.47]I'm going right now.
[123:55.62]Let's go.
[124:12.62]Okay, Wendy?
[124:27.31]Hurry up!
[124:31.43]I got the dough.
[124:35.27]Thank you.
[124:35.84]Cool.
[124:36.28]Okay.
[124:37.10]Back to the house.
[124:37.80]Save the game.
[124:45.27]Prove you're not on the toilet right now.
[124:49.89]It's probably TOS.
[124:51.98]But I think it would be kind of funny if one day I just kind of turned on the webcam.
[124:56.26]And I was just sitting on the toilet.
[124:58.54]Just with a full computer in front of me streaming.
[125:00.90]Like a headset on and shit.
[125:10.19]Okay.
[125:10.89]I'm saved.
[125:11.49]I'm ready.
[125:17.95]Guillermo, you sound like you're in a bathroom.
[125:19.73]You sound like you're in a bathroom.
[125:21.63]What up?
[125:21.93]You know what you're talking about.
[125:24.33]Is this some kind of fucking bathroom thing?
[125:46.10]Close the door.
[125:47.10]No, I need to be able to see.
[125:52.35]Okay, now they're...
[126:19.44]Suspect.
[126:22.06]Oh.
[126:22.62]Oh.
[126:23.88]Oh.
[126:24.42]Suspect on the loose.
[126:32.62]I'm a fugitive.
[126:33.12]That means I get extra points.
[126:44.85]Okay.
[126:45.15]Last one is just this person.
[126:48.01]They're in a really strange spot with tons of police activity.
[127:05.98]Good to go.
[127:07.24]Alright.
[127:08.32]Now just get home.
[127:20.01]There he is.
[127:20.57]There he is.
[127:22.33]There he is.
[127:24.37]There he is.
[127:26.54]Eleven.
[127:31.42]That's not even in this game, but I wish it was.
[127:36.48]Same line, just pitch shifted up and down.
[127:39.09]Could be a different person.
[127:40.25]Alright, made it.
[127:48.13]Safe.
[127:50.24]Oh, save game one.
[127:51.92]Oh.

[128:24.27]You're on it.
[128:24.63]Then you're on it.

[129:06.11]I have that, I think.
[129:14.02]Where is it?
[129:19.24]Do I have 20?
[129:22.23]I think I just picked it up, didn't I?
[129:31.87]I fucking knew it was on.
[129:33.97]You guys think I'm stupid?
[129:46.62]Weed.
[129:46.92]How much weed do I have?
[129:49.96]Not enough, apparently.
[129:50.72]20?
[129:51.18]What the fuck?
[129:54.36]Didn't I get a bunch?
[129:56.04]Was it taken from me?
[130:01.86]10?
[130:03.70]Did I... Somebody already... I need... That's a lot.
[130:12.57]Alright, Eddie, I need an order.
[130:15.70]Just a bunch.
[130:16.40]I don't want to have to think about this again.
[130:18.20]Like 50.
[130:19.86]No.
[130:21.14]100.
[130:21.24]He's pretending.
[130:31.89]Don't tell him.
[130:32.47]The filter is still on.
[130:33.65]No, it is on now.
[130:35.01]It's off now.
[130:43.88]My prices?
[130:45.46]Ooh, prices.
[130:46.14]Okay, marijuana.
[130:47.08]12 bucks?
[130:50.98]What?
[130:51.22]That's too high?
[130:52.22]11.
[130:52.24]Um... 10.5.
[130:59.59]I can't even up the prices.
[131:02.55]What are you talking about?
[131:12.64]Don't tell him.
[131:13.26]What are you talking about?
[131:15.08]There's nothing on.
[131:16.93]What is he saying?
[131:17.69]I need to listen to see what it sounds like.
[131:21.09]I can find out if you guys are bullshitting me or not.
[131:26.29]Let's see.
[131:27.17]No, it sounds fucking normal to me.
[131:29.63]It's normal.
[131:30.73]Now it's not normal.
[131:32.94]This is what it sounded like before.
[131:35.96]Hey, what's up?
[131:37.88]Hey.
[131:38.88]Hey, what's going on?
[131:41.11]Okay, that's kind of interesting, I guess.

[138:36.22]They're going to leave.
[138:37.10]But it's okay.
[138:39.94]You go up, you go down.
[138:41.10]You go up, you go down.
[138:44.04]You gain viewers, you lose viewers.
[138:45.50]You lose viewers, you gain viewers.
[138:47.02]You lose viewers, you lose viewers.
[138:48.36]You lose viewers, you lose viewers.

[139:49.10]You didn't... I mean, maybe like 500 of you came here for Funny Noises.
[139:53.04]No, why would you come into this stream for Funny Noises?
[139:56.70]The title of the stream is like Drug Crack or something.
[139:59.16]Like it's a drug dealing game.
[140:00.59]You clicked on the stream because you thought you were going to watch a drug dealing game.
[140:04.04]The title of the stream is not, hey, like, listen to fucking funny voices stream.
[140:08.14]That's not what this is.

[158:02.10]He's dipping into his own supply.
[158:04.08]Fuck, it's hot in here.
[158:18.60]Fart into the mic, fugitive.
[158:27.50]Filactory Lich gave another $50 earlier, and they say, thanks for basically making an abridged Jerma stream.
[158:36.95]You're very welcome.
[158:43.09]Fart into the mic, fugitive.
[158:48.73]Three grams.
[158:49.65]There it is.
[158:50.17]There's the fugitive.
[158:56.15]There you are.
[158:56.63]Alright, we'll let you go.
[158:59.15]But you have to fart into this mic.
[159:05.56]Alright, does this guy want the weed?
[159:08.42]No, he wants ecstasy.
[159:10.26]I don't have it.
[159:13.16]Do it.
[159:13.60]Do it, citizen.
[159:15.88]Do it, citizen.
[159:17.06]That wasn't very good.
[159:17.90]I can do better than that.
[159:19.24]You're a citizen.
[159:22.81]The stupid filter's not even on.
[159:24.19]You're a citizen.
[159:32.39]Fuck the microphone.
[159:33.67]No.
[159:45.74]No.
[159:49.91]I'm clearing it all because I know I'll abuse it.
[159:52.07]I will.
[159:52.39]I will.
[159:52.93]Hey, thank you MilkSistant for the five community subs.
[160:02.44]Appreciate it.
[160:12.73]Let us record them.
[160:17.38]These are pre-recorded subs.
[160:19.34]Now, that's actually funny.
[160:20.78]If I just do, like, six of these, and it's just banking fake people, I would confuse the fuck out of a lot of people.
[160:27.77]Okay, then there's two people up here.
[160:37.88]Level 10!
[160:39.68]New drug!
[160:42.80]Jeremy, you should do a stream that's half pre-recorded and half live and have chat guests.
[160:47.92]I got crystal meth now.
[160:49.14]That would be really, really hard.
[160:52.48]Okay, those of you that remember the detective stream.
[160:55.86]That would be very hard to do.
[160:57.29]Because I would have to be able to take control, but there would have to be a video.
[161:05.75]The detective stream was already just so hard and so many moving parts.
[161:17.46]That was so much fun though.
[161:21.42]If you might be new to the channel.
[161:24.30]We did a game where I pre-recorded an entire stream.
[161:28.83]And then I just sat in the chat room with fake accounts.
[161:31.57]And people had to try to find me and find who I was in the chat.
[161:36.77]and every about five to ten minutes there was a freeze in the video and people had to pick and vote on who it was and some people got banned that shouldn't have been I was I lasted a pretty long time do another one the thing about that though is that you want to talk about oh wow what a that's a long well that was a very very elaborate stream that must have taken a lot of effort
[162:04.96]It's more so The accounts need to be I need to have accounts that are like more than three four five six months old subbed to people subbed to random streamers Following random fucking people and have activity on the account for like fucking two years So that's where it gets to be hard What does he want oh I tried to loot it
[162:38.29]I will just give you my account.
[162:40.96]No, but that's your account though.
[162:43.36]I need ecstasy.
[162:47.62]Back home.
[162:48.08]I need ecstasy.
[162:49.50]Right now.
[162:54.86]Yeah, and somebody just said that also might be actually against terms of service.
[162:58.88]I don't think I... They probably wouldn't... Twitch would probably be pretty unhappy with that somehow.
[163:04.33]I would assume.
[163:05.91]Just give me your accounts, guys.
[163:19.05]distribution in sector b might get tricky like the blockades got lifted right on let's go look around sector b shall we wait a new sector but keep in mind that the police will search your shit each time you pass the checkpoint so if you need to move something illegal through that wall well we're gonna have to get creative
[163:41.76]Okay.
[163:43.30]Oh, we got cash.
[163:44.14]I'll take it.
[163:47.30]Got some new property.
[163:48.46]Alright, well, what does he got for property?
[163:50.34]We need a hideout.
[163:53.19]Police lifted the blockade for Sector B. Okay.
[163:57.53]Checkpoints are guarded by police officers.
[163:58.97]To move contraband through the wall, you'll have to find alternative ways to the other side and back.
[164:03.05]That was a pain in the ass.
[164:11.22]Old town small apartment.
[164:15.20]Stink building.
[164:15.92]Second floor stink building.
[164:19.48]Small dog's warehouse.

[168:37.36]I was about to be like, nice.
[168:39.22]Fresh fruit!
[168:40.28]I thought, like, stuffed at the brim of bananas.
[168:42.44]That checkpoint's up by the drugstore, right?
[168:53.22]Yeah, it's right over here.
[169:04.61]No, it's open.
[169:10.15]Okay.
[169:11.79]Wait.
[169:13.97]I know how to do this.
[169:15.61]Just throw your backpack over the wall.

[169:41.64]Oh.
[169:42.64]Open it.
[169:42.90]Yeah, I know that's like a reference to a television series.
[169:54.27]What's up here?
[169:54.67]The drugstore?
[169:55.19]Oh my god.
[170:07.45]How do I get to the drugstore?

[170:31.87]Can't go in?
[170:35.04]Why?
[170:42.36]What?
[170:42.48]You're going to tell me to leave?
[170:43.50]Alright, let's try this.
[170:57.26]I want to test this theory.
[171:10.82]I was following the wrong indicator.
[171:14.98]Got this crystal meth in here.
[171:20.05]What can you do with crystal meth?
[171:22.43]Ready to put it and make a pill?
[171:27.73]Is it in the truck?
[171:28.95]On the back of the truck?

[171:56.11]That was pretty good.
[172:00.67]That was alright.
[172:01.89]I'd say that was like a seven.
[172:16.10]Okay, let's try it.
[172:19.45]I hit minus seven, that didn't even count.
[172:27.07]But I was playing catch the backpack.
[172:29.85]No, it's in the backpack, right?
[172:40.23]How did you find drugs?
[172:41.17]It was in the backpack.
[172:41.87]What?

[174:33.72]We'll meet.
[174:34.26]You bring me cash and you get a clean legal transfer from my company to your account.
[174:37.56]40% fee?
[174:40.02]What the fuck?
[174:43.74]That's too much.
[174:45.28]No, I'll just store it in my mattress.
[174:47.82]Thank you, though.
[174:54.35]Wait, these guys want drugs.
[174:57.53]So this is cash and then ecstasy.

[203:15.63]Okay, I want to see how they do this because with the shredded lettuce, wouldn't this just dump all over the place?
[203:22.32]That would just cascade off of the plate.
[203:29.37]No, no way.
[203:30.09]That's glued.
[203:30.81]That has to be glued on.
[203:32.65]Right here, this is on the floor.
[203:34.35]Right there.
[203:34.63]It's like on the floor right there.
[203:35.53]Shit.
[203:36.11]It's glued.
[203:37.13]Shit.
[203:45.75]That's my favorite part right there.
[203:46.85]This guy with the briefcase with the fucking suit on and the gray suit.
[203:49.41]Look at that.
[203:49.75]Like he goes low and he like left, right, low.
[203:53.47]That's my favorite part.
[203:56.09]Bang, bang.
[203:57.23]Like the guy with the briefcase.
[203:58.09]I love the briefcase guy.
[203:58.97]He's my favorite character.
[204:00.45]Briefcase guy.
[204:01.45]McDLT briefcase guy is going to be in the next Rumble.
[204:07.43]I love that guy.
[204:08.91]I wish I knew that guy.
[204:13.29]And by the way, his stats are going to be 100 and everything.
[204:18.72]Okay, I want 20 grams of meth.
[204:20.58]Do you still have some?
[204:21.98]I think so.
[204:30.07]It's probably as old as your dad.
[204:33.67]Well, I mean, yeah.
[204:34.33]I mean, that commercial was like 1981 or something.
[204:41.67]Alright, I need 20.
[204:42.89]How many did I pick up?
[204:49.84]Like Jason Alexander was so good.
[204:51.76]He looked he's like his quick lightning movements.
[204:54.78]Just bang bang Just like wha wha is walking and like electric guitar like he was so animated.
[205:00.69]He could just be like boom boom $1,000 wait, where's my I have pit coins too.
[205:09.95]Where did I get this money?
[205:12.08]Where did I get $900 from?
[205:17.87]I gotta break down this crystal meth.
[205:19.03]How much do you think I want?
[205:19.80]20.
[205:22.50]So, okay.
[205:23.26]What did you want?
[205:23.74]3?
[205:23.76]I'm gonna break this down.
[205:26.54]What was it in Breaking Bad?
[205:28.12]Okay, I have one.
[205:50.77]Alright, now I got 20- I need 20 of crystal meth.
[205:56.62]Fuck.
[205:56.96]Okay, that's all I can do right now.
[205:58.94]Let's go.
[205:59.68]I need to pay Eddie.
[206:00.08]I think I owe Eddie $700.
[206:00.76]Jesse, we have to- $840?
[206:03.41]What?
[206:03.51]That's all my money.
[206:22.81]The hot stays hot, the cool stays crisp.
[206:29.52]I actually don't like crispy lettuce on any of my hamburgers.
[206:33.84]Because it's like watery.
[206:36.78]It's like eating pickles.
[206:38.90]I don't like pickles either.
[206:39.80]Because when you bite it, when it pickles on your burger, or like crispy wet lettuce is all over you, it makes it watery.
[206:46.79]You get like this little layer of water that pools up on top.
[206:52.16]Pickles do it too.
[206:54.12]When you bite into a pickle with your burger, you bite into the... Okay, there we go.
[206:57.56]My teeth.
[206:58.47]Here's their layers they're going through.
[207:00.63]Bread.
[207:02.07]Cheese.
[207:03.05]Onions.
[207:03.73]Mushrooms.
[207:04.95]Cilantro.
[207:06.61]Pickles.
[207:07.27]Water.
[207:08.72]Meat.
[207:09.90]Fun.
[207:10.32]Like, no.
[207:11.26]Get it off.
[207:26.72]I'll get arrested.
[207:40.37]I got crystal meth.
[207:41.57]Crystal meth is expensive, isn't it?
[207:43.78]You know, I'm just going to Jack the prices up a million percent for one day.
[207:53.15]Goiki just gave 5,000 bits.
[207:54.87]Another $50 drop.
[207:57.09]$50 donation in bits.
[207:58.47]Thank you, all of you, for the extreme amounts of money.
[208:01.67]Seems to happen every fucking stream.
[208:03.60]Thank you.
[208:04.86]Goiki, though, says, Okay, human burger expert, if that's no good, if that's no good, build us your perfect burger right now.
[208:14.10]What's the perfect burger?
[208:16.44]Um, okay.
[208:20.14]Listen, listen up.
[208:23.07]Tomato?
[208:24.27]Get rid of it.
[208:25.57]Do not ever put tomato on anything for any reason.
[208:28.19]The only time the tomato should ever be consumed is if it's mashed the fuck up and turned into spaghetti sauce.
[208:33.66]Tomatoes are disgusting.
[208:35.50]Wet, slimy, watery tomato.
[208:37.64]No.
[208:38.44]It ruins it for me.
[208:41.43]Grill up some onions and mushrooms in the same pan.
[208:43.15]A little bit of butter and maybe a little bit of garlic in there.
[208:48.00]Get them nice and sweat them out.
[208:50.54]Mushrooms, onions, sweat them out, caramelize them.
[208:54.55]Take that slop when it's done.
[208:56.82]That caramelized, gooey, sticky, fucking hot, delicious stuff.
[209:03.52]When you fry up some onions and some mushrooms.
[209:07.38]Get it up.
[209:09.02]Right on the top part of the bun.
[209:10.12]Make sure the bun has been toasted, by the way.
[209:12.12]I'm not talking, like, toast it until you crunch through it and it hurts your teeth.
[209:15.34]No.
[209:15.78]Just barely golden brown.
[209:18.22]You can do that on a stovetop or a pan.
[209:20.28]By the way, don't cook... Charcoal grill.
[209:24.79]Get your gas grills out of here.
[209:26.55]Charcoal grill wood.
[209:29.43]Real good hardwood.
[209:33.33]Get that up to temperature on a grill.
[209:36.61]On one side.
[209:37.43]This is making me hungry.
[209:39.97]You only got to do this for a few minutes.
[209:41.89]Cover it up.
[209:42.41]Cover the dome or cover your grill with whatever you have.
[209:45.67]You want to let it cook a little bit all the way through, but you don't want it to get past medium, medium well.
[209:50.39]You want to really just get a good sear on both sides.
[209:52.98]Flip.
[209:53.66]Two or three minutes.
[209:54.34]Flip.
[209:54.62]Two or three minutes.
[209:55.24]Bang.
[209:55.92]Charcoal grill.
[209:56.72]Hot.
[209:57.24]Fucking hot grill.
[209:58.36]Hot, hot side.
[209:59.46]You want to take that hot, hot side.
[210:01.71]Put it on the bottom part.
[210:03.21]Smear a little bit of mayo.
[210:05.81]Shh.
[210:07.51]I know.
[210:08.33]Some of you, I don't care.
[210:09.07]Just a little bit.
[210:10.35]A little bit of mayonnaise on the top part of the bun.
[210:14.02]Put your slurry of grilled caramelized goo onions and fucking mushrooms right there.
[210:21.03]You turn that burger when it's almost ready to go, you flip the burger over, now you're gonna finish it.
[210:25.59]Slap a big thick, and I'm talking at least, you know, like when the person at the deli holds this thing up to you, and they go, is that good?
[210:34.14]And you go, no, a little bit thicker.
[210:35.56]That's what I'm talking, just one tier up.
[210:38.14]Swiss cheese.
[210:39.94]Whack on top of that burger.
[210:42.69]Let it melt.
[210:44.09]Pull it off.
[210:44.97]Cover it.
[210:45.79]Swiss cheese.
[210:47.09]Fucking caramelized onions, mushrooms, a little bit of mayo.
[210:50.86]That's it.
[210:51.24]That's all you have to do.
[210:57.34]No lettuce.
[210:58.26]No tomato.
[210:59.58]None of those disgusting wet foods.
[211:02.53]No disgusting wet vegetables that turn into water in your mouth when you chew them.
[211:06.89]Oh, by the way, how many times have you done this shit?
[211:12.20]I will demonstrate.
[211:12.92]I will demonstrate with a... Ready?
[211:15.78]How many times have you done this?
[211:19.36]I gotta go on... Can I go on cam for this one?
[211:22.13]You bite into a burger with a piece of lettuce on it.
[211:24.89]Yeah, all you lettuce fans.
[211:27.61]This is... We're talking about you here.
[211:35.53]This is for the lettuce fans.
[211:40.40]You're not going to capture my webcam?
[211:41.72]Or are you going to be fucking stupid about this?
[211:43.08]You're not going to capture my fucking webcam?
[211:49.99]Are you going to be a dick about this game?
[211:51.17]Who's going to be a dick about this?
[211:54.37]Are you going to be a dick about this?
[212:05.01]I can't pull my webcam through.
[212:07.26]I have to, though.
[212:09.09]Hold on a second.
[212:10.69]Important.
[212:16.59]Why won't this get captured?
[212:30.74]Okay, there we go.
[212:37.56]So hear me out on this.
[212:39.08]A lot of people, let me, come on, let me, I don't care about my Reddit.
[212:43.12]Alright, listen to me.
[212:51.49]When you bite into a burger that has lettuce on it, this happens maybe 30 to 40, maybe even 20% of the time.
[212:57.07]That's too much of a risk to take.
[213:21.44]I don't want you- Fuck the pops!
[213:23.70]I just shaved, too.
[213:25.02]Look, when you bite into a burger that has lettuce on it, this just fell on the ground.
[213:29.66]I can't- I'm gonna bite a burger, okay?
[213:37.44]This has lettuce on it.
[213:39.53]I'm gonna take a big bite.
[213:40.93]Here's the burger, right here.
[213:41.65]I got it.
[213:42.55]You ready to see what happens when you have fucking lettuce on a hamburger?
[213:49.41]Oh, what's that?
[213:50.55]The whole fucking thing came out?
[213:54.82]And then, now what do you have to do?
[213:56.70]Now you have to go, um, oops.
[214:01.06]Take the, put the bun up and like put it back on and put it back like this.
[214:06.90]Let me go.
[214:07.82]Mmm, delicious.
[214:10.76]That's weak teeth.
[214:12.76]No, that's, you pull it out, it's just like...
[214:16.85]And then the fucking tomato falls, and then you look at the fucking plate, and what's that?
[214:21.62]The tomato's, like, red water is, like, bleeding all over your plate, and it's like, no, that's not, like, juice from the burger.
[214:29.22]That's, like, blood from my tomato.
[214:32.62]Oh, get those wet vegetables out of here.
[214:36.06]Get those... Good thing I turned on the webcam to do that.
[214:38.88]It only took, like, four minutes to turn it on.
[214:45.03]no no wet no wet vegetables on hamburgers oh I think people need their drugs classic redditor crying over lettuce they do this
[215:01.00]No, look, I love lettuce.
[215:03.17]I like lettuce in salads, on sandwiches, cold sandwiches.
[215:08.33]When you have a hot sandwich and you put lettuce on it, you're just adding a gross piece of paper that disintegrates into like this weird, like somebody said Reese's paper before.
[215:19.92]That's what it turns into a lot of times.
[215:27.08]I love salads.
[215:27.96]I love romaine lettuce.
[215:29.46]I think of the romaine hearts that crunch on a salad on like a nice sub.
[215:35.35]You know, if you like a nice Italian sub, you put like a little bit of, you know, maybe you put a tomato on it, whatever.
[215:40.88]I love like bruschetta.
[215:42.24]Tomato.
[215:42.92]Delicious.
[215:43.46]It's designed that way.
[215:53.72]That's E. coli lettuce.
[215:55.68]Well, that's what we call slander.
[215:57.80]And I didn't say it, you did.
[215:59.12]This is so loud.
[216:09.37]Lettuce.
[216:12.59]Lettuce is just like... Lettuce is a scam.
[216:17.46]They've said... The fucking lettuce... Lettuce... The big... The big lettuce has found a way to convince you to eat water.
[216:28.60]I'm telling you, it spits big lettuce.
[216:33.61]Big romaine.
[216:34.79]I actually do like lettuce, though.
[216:46.88]I'm just walking around at night.
[216:48.28]What am I doing?
[216:50.32]Oh, Eddie.
[216:50.76]Right, I gotta pay Eddie.
[216:54.47]Do a poll?
[216:55.61]No, because I know the things I'm saying.
[216:57.01]People are like, he's fucking crazy.
[216:59.83]How many takes blood pressure?
[217:01.01]What is it at right now?
[217:01.85]Is it like 180 over like fucking 160?
[217:04.21]Dude, relax.
[217:05.03]It's lettuce.
[217:06.13]I know.
[217:07.43]But I don't like lettuce on hot food.
[217:10.08]I think it kind of just adds nothing.
[217:16.84]I think lettuce on cold food, yes.
[217:18.44]Lettuce on hot food.
[217:19.25]I don't like it.
[217:21.77]I don't like it.
[217:23.21]It's okay.
[217:32.20]What about on tacos?
[217:36.16]Okay.
[217:36.76]Here's the thing about tacos.
[217:38.12]Hold on.
[217:38.66]Tacos.
[217:44.14]got him not hold on just give me a second I'm about to get arrested for being outside hear me out about tacos tacos are an interesting thing because the lettuce in a taco does not get hot like it does when you put it in between bread and in a hamburger that's hot off the grill lettuce sits protected on top of two or three different ingredients
[218:09.63]Meat's at the bottom, and it's very bottom.
[218:12.19]On top of that, you've got potentially fucking sauce, cheese, cold cheese, by the way.
[218:16.51]On top of that, you've got potentially, like, salsa, and then on top of that, you've got lettuce.
[218:20.15]Lettuce never touches anything hot.
[218:22.84]Lettuce never comes into contact with any of the hot food.
[218:25.36]Putting the lettuce down on the burger, boom, you've compromised it.
[218:32.40]I'm just telling you the things that I think.
[218:38.42]What about the tortilla?
[218:42.84]Somebody wrote it in all caps.
[218:47.44]Someone institutionalize him.
[218:50.27]What the fuck?
[218:52.85]It's not the same thing because there's no top part of listen when you have a hamburger you are closing it up so the heat gets like trapped in between the buns a Taco is open at the top.
[219:07.30]There is no top to a taco You don't close the taco and have the meat heat up the lettuce so it gets hot and salt is soggy and shit Lock this guy up
[219:27.62]Who puts salsa on a burger?
[219:29.16]I'm talking about putting salsa on a taco.
[219:32.82]By the way, a salsa on a burger, I'm sure there's some that exist where you could put something like, I don't know, there's probably different creations.
[219:40.10]You'll be hearing from my lawyers.
[219:47.42]I like putting shit on burgers.
[219:50.01]I like putting, that would probably be kind of good.
[219:55.58]No, it wouldn't.
[219:56.26]Oh, I don't like, like, wet tomatoes.
[219:57.56]I'm saying no wet stuff.
[220:02.58]Oh, and by the way, can we get over this, like, put mac and cheese on everything?
[220:05.76]Can we get over this?
[220:09.99]I don't understand it.
[220:13.09]Put mac and cheese on your hamburger.
[220:14.49]Put mac and cheese on your pizza.
[220:15.65]Put mac and cheese on your lobster.
[220:22.75]I'm over it.
[220:30.99]Lobster mac is so good.
[220:32.51]I know, but like... Crab is better than lobster.
[220:39.96]Why is there no crab mac and cheese?
[220:41.58]Why is it always lobster mac and cheese?
[220:43.00]How come there's no crab?
[220:43.96]Why they don't like the crab so much?
[220:45.30]Crab is better than lobster.
[220:49.20]King crab is better than the best lobster I've ever had.
[220:55.67]Crab is just better than lobster.
[220:57.39]I'm sorry.
[220:57.79]And this is coming from somebody from New England.
[221:00.93]Me saying that crab is better than lobster, I may as well just said, like, fuck the Red Sox out loud.
[221:15.41]Oh, I got money.
[221:18.81]How much ecstasy do you want, man?
[221:20.27]How much ecstasy do I have?
[221:30.54]Bruins.
[221:31.12]Alright, I have... I don't have enough ecstasy.
[221:38.58]I have a bunch of bullshit, but this is not even real.
[221:46.91]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[221:49.11]Wait, I got money?
[221:49.99]24 of ecstasy.
[221:54.11]I don't even have 5 ecstasy.
[221:55.95]I don't have any.
[221:56.43]I need more ecstasy now.
[221:58.29]Eddie, hit me up.
[222:01.18]I need a shitload of ecstasy.
[222:02.83]50.
[222:04.93]No.
[222:05.13]100.
[222:06.41]What the fuck is going on?
[222:16.17]Guys, he's just goofing.
[222:17.04]He doesn't really believe his crazy ideas.
[222:23.36]Oh, fuck.
[222:25.52]I gotta get my money.
[222:26.22]I got two deliveries of money.
[222:35.01]He's pretending, right?
[222:36.24]Okay, yes.
[222:36.78]Alright, get these two collections.
[223:03.73]So, by the way, if you are curious, we're going to be doing community content night tomorrow.
[223:08.40]That's the plan tomorrow.
[223:10.32]Don't know what community content night is.
[223:11.64]That's where we just hang out, chill, and we look at artwork people have made for the community and videos people have made.
[223:21.56]Random stuff.
[223:23.76]Just kind of hang out for a couple hours, three or four hours or so.
[223:26.26]Everyone's saying into the stream voice and they're right.
[223:30.45]They are correct.
[223:32.69]Remember I told you I gotta follow the doctor's orders here, I gotta follow the new rules.
[223:39.37]More stream days, less stream time.
[223:41.37]Gotta follow the rules.
[223:55.96]Stupid doctor, what does he know?
[224:01.60]I don't know.
[224:02.02]Almond or Wi-Fi.
[224:06.02]$494.
[224:11.20]This game was fun.
[224:15.17]You ready to give your first impressions?
[224:17.39]Okay.
[224:17.85]First impressions after eight, nine hours of playing?
[224:25.25]Good.
[224:25.97]It's good.
[224:26.43]I just wish there was more to do.
[224:31.93]It's fun to go around and, like, sell drugs.
[224:34.95]But... I mean, I feel like I've kind of been selling drugs to the same five people for eight hours.
[224:47.78]Actual opinion.
[224:49.36]Not joke.
[224:50.08]I just told you that's what I think.
[224:54.06]Official review.
[224:54.80]It's a negative review.
[224:56.16]No, it's not.
[224:56.88]I think it's fun.
[225:00.56]I mean, I haven't been like, nobody's like robbed me.
[225:02.88]I haven't had any fights.
[225:05.24]All I've been doing is kind of just running around and just giving people drugs that they order from my computer.
[225:13.67]I'm level 10.
[225:14.15]I only have three more things I can unlock.
[225:20.01]Is there anything else I can even do?
[225:22.37]It's just been a lucid dream.
[225:32.52]Just make crack.
[225:35.00]Well, I can't make crack until I need cocaine, right?
[225:39.07]I can't get cocaine until level 16.
[225:49.73]Just do the drugs.
[225:52.44]Put them in your quick slots to do them.

[229:32.23]Alright, what is it called?
[229:46.58]Poison.
[229:50.32]Alright.
[229:52.29]Pick up the poison.
[229:53.01]Poison.
[230:06.79]Okay.
[230:16.36]Wait, that's not took deluded.
[230:18.08]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[230:19.95]It's two.

[230:52.28]Am I floating?
[230:53.08]I'm flying!
[231:35.11]Moon shoes.
[231:40.19]We need more FOV.
[231:43.67]Let me see if I can get some FOV.
[231:47.81]Okay.
[232:12.09]I can't- Yo, what?
[232:15.27]Ow!
[232:17.72]He's crying.
[232:20.72]Oh shit.
[232:24.44]Alright, I'm gonna call it here.
[232:26.96]Saturday.
[232:35.92]At first, I thought that was $1.
[232:37.08]Alright, well, that's Drug Dealer Simulator.
[232:45.01]We had some fun.
[232:46.17]Talked about hamburgers.
[232:49.73]Sold some drugs.
[232:50.61]I got to level 10.
[232:51.70]I think that's pretty good.
[232:55.24]I will see you tomorrow for Community Content Night.
[232:58.18]Take care, everybody.
[232:59.46]See you tomorrow.
[233:02.52]Those of you sticking around, we're going to do these subs and bits and everything.
[233:04.84]And chill for a little bit.
[233:08.30]We'll see you tomorrow.
[233:10.35]Around 4 p.m.
[233:12.03]Pacific.
[233:14.97]Take care.
[233:18.93]Let's get the music rolling.
[233:27.98]So, where are we in the bits?
[233:30.36]We are down here.
[233:33.24]with 250 from StyxRenegade, we all should have pretended he was streaming.
[233:38.19]See how long he'd last.
[233:42.75]Um, if I, if you guys were to sit here and just write, I told you, I thought I was live because I saw like 10 people write the word live in all capitals.
[233:50.88]So I was like, okay, that people usually do that.
[233:54.20]So I had talking to nobody for 60 seconds at least.
[234:02.14]So, yeah, you guys have fun doing that, don't you?
[234:06.57]Yamaha, thanks for the 300 bits.
[234:07.97]Jermo, when are you streaming Circus Maximus Chariot Wars for the PlayStation 2?
[234:14.59]I did not know that game existed until right now.
[234:17.98]I'll have to go look up and see what it is.
[234:19.86]See if I'd want to play it for the PlayStation 2 Portable.
[234:23.72]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[234:27.01]Hey, Zake, thanks for the 250.
[234:28.31]It's only a matter of time when VR will be at a point where all of our senses, thoughts, and memories will be simulated.
[234:34.96]This new world will be superior in every way.
[234:40.60]And there will be no reason to go back.
[234:44.68]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[234:46.84]Do we know this hasn't happened already?
[234:50.38]Anyway, love your streams.
[234:52.82]Keep, keep, keep, keep, keep, keep, keep, keep it wholesome.
[234:58.19]Oh, my head.
[235:00.31]Sorry.
[235:00.87]I had a backache for a second.
[235:04.51]Hey, the chef's corner.
[235:05.41]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[235:07.53]No one wants to give you money because you are a nerd.
[235:10.15]No.
[235:18.24]Well, thanks for the $10 telling me that no one wants to give me money while you give me money.
[235:24.34]I do appreciate a thousand bits though.
[235:25.78]Chef's corner.
[235:28.93]Hey, Video Games McGee, thanks for 500 bits.
[235:30.67]Okay, thank you, Video Games McGee.
[235:33.85]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[235:56.26]Hey, are you feeling the burn thanks to the 500 bits?
[235:59.15]No message, just a bunch of PogChamps.
[236:02.83]Dark Soul, thanks for 250.
[236:04.07]I wasn't kidding about the whole Skyrim VR thing.
[236:06.57]Oh, the porn part, yeah.
[236:08.33]The game is really fun, actually, when you get VRIK going and have a full character body with sheets and stuff.
[236:15.44]It's a lot more responsive than you'd expect.
[236:17.94]And you can still mob the shit out of it.
[236:19.46]This PSA has been brought to you by Todd Squad.
[236:23.38]Thanks, Todd Squad.
[236:26.06]Yeah, I just need to get healthy.
[236:29.12]I actually have a doctor's appointment coming up here.
[236:33.14]We get to play the game called... It's been pretty much narrowed down 100%.
[236:39.86]It's either intercostal nerve damage.
[236:51.00]Which explains the cost of chondritis.
[236:54.33]Or I may have rheumatoid arthritis.
[236:57.71]There's ways to treat them both.
[236:59.91]But I don't want to really talk about if they're 100%.
[237:02.13]But the costochondritis is still a thing.
[237:04.91]And it can be caused by potential damage to your intercostal nerve.
[237:09.69]So, I don't know.
[237:11.09]I don't know.
[237:15.12]But once that is in the rear view mirror, and I can actually, like, not have to worry about it every day, then I will go back to being able to be a lot more physical in front of the camera, like you were used to, like, a year ago or so.
[237:34.43]We'll see.
[237:35.79]Hey, Creamcorn, thanks for the 250.
[237:37.43]Jerma, I just hit 100,000 channel points.
[237:39.47]When are we getting another high-tier point sync?
[237:42.99]Sooner than you think.
[237:45.56]Sooner than you think.
[237:48.41]Got some ideas.
[237:51.43]Oh.
[238:05.98]Should I not have talked all this shit about, uh, I can't help it.
[238:09.28]What did I say yesterday?
[238:09.96]I was going to dropkick it out of my window or something?
[238:12.61]I'm just, I'm just full of emotion.
[238:14.61]You know what I mean?
[238:15.13]Like, I'm just full of emotion.
[238:18.13]I just, like, I was fighting it.
[238:23.56]I'm just, I'm so emotional.
[238:26.99]Remember when I took the element test to say that I was fire and air?
[238:30.43]Makes sense, doesn't it?
[238:31.25]There's no way I'm Earth or metal.
[238:34.09]Or water.
[238:35.55]I'm absolutely fire and air together, combined.
[238:37.74]Which is steam.
[238:39.00]No, which is gas.
[238:40.74]No, which is... Dust.
[238:44.74]What is it?
[238:46.16]Hot air.
[238:48.18]He's all fire.
[238:49.14]He's all hot air.
[238:50.73]Oh, fuck.
[238:52.25]You know what I mean.
[238:53.69]Fucking gas or something.
[238:55.05]I don't know.
[238:57.38]Thanks tag.
[238:57.94]I'll actually look into it.
[239:01.57]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[239:02.39]Thanks for the 10 bucks tag.
[239:04.47]You're doing well.
[239:06.67]Vladkovich, thanks for the 500 bits.
[239:10.51]Leonks, thanks for the thousand bits.
[239:12.05]$10.

[240:44.23]Where is it?
[240:44.73]No, no, no, no.
[240:45.51]I don't want to... This is like an ad website.
[240:47.17]I need to go on, like, YouTube.
[240:54.68]YouTube.
[241:04.93]Okay, hold on.
[241:05.39]Alright, look, look, look.

[241:14.95]How about the music?
[241:30.66]Hopefully this works.
[241:32.26]It's probably not going to work.
[241:35.13]I'm trying to get it to work.
[241:35.95]It's not on YouTube.
[241:45.62]I'm trying to, I'm gonna, hold on.

[242:16.13]You seeing this?
[242:26.31]Look at him!
[242:30.67]Frosted their day with a great taste of frost.
[242:36.63]Tigers start their day with a great taste of frost.
[242:40.65]See, you guys thought I was lying.
[242:48.55]He's like, I'm telling you, they made him like, didn't he used to take up the whole screen?
[242:57.20]Are they trying to like shrink him down so he's like a kid or something?
[243:00.34]I don't get it.
[243:00.82]He used to like bump into shit and be like, well, sorry about that.
[243:04.96]I'm fucking huge.
[243:06.58]They're great.
[243:08.88]And even when he pointed his finger up, he would break the chandelier and shit.
[243:12.47]He would break the light above him.
[243:14.73]He was a fucking terror.
[243:16.81]You didn't want him in your house.
[243:27.82]But anyways, yeah, they shrunk them.
[243:33.09]Thanks for the ten bucks, Leon.
[243:34.25]Appreciate it.
[243:39.21]Hey, Vladkovich, thanks for another thousand bits.
[243:42.42]Ten dollars.
[243:42.90]Dermot, three things.
[243:44.28]One, you're rad.
[243:45.88]Two, when are you going to play the Resident Evil 3 remake?
[243:48.22]And three, you should make your bit sound a cash-registered cha-ching sound.
[243:53.24]I don't even know what it is now.
[243:55.42]I think I deleted them all.
[243:58.62]I have such ADHD.
[244:02.04]The sub sounds and the bit sounds... They... I just like... They distract me.
[244:08.67]If I hear it, I just go, what was that noise?
[244:09.97]And I have to pay attention over here now.
[244:12.41]Like... Noise over there.
[244:14.93]What was that noise?
[244:15.43]And then I get like killed on the screen.
[244:21.96]Make it you laughing?
[244:22.84]No, I don't want to do that.
[244:27.46]I remember when there used to be subs and bit sounds.
[244:30.22]Yeah, I know.
[244:30.94]Just make it a sneeze.
[244:39.44]I can't make it a sneeze.
[244:41.15]When am I going to play Resident Evil 3 Remake?
[244:43.29]I don't know.
[244:43.89]I have no idea.
[244:45.51]Hopefully at some point over the next two weeks.
[244:48.65]I don't know.
[244:49.01]I have no plan.
[244:49.87]I never have a plan.
[244:50.65]Jeremy, no plan, Elbertson.
[244:54.51]Invictus, thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[244:57.79]$15.
[244:59.07]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[244:59.81]Hello, Jerma.
[245:00.19]I just wanted to send you a picture of my rats.
[245:02.51]Charlie, Winston, Eric.
[245:04.05]I'd like to sit on my lap while I watch your VODs.
[245:05.81]Thanks.
[245:06.43]Love ya.
[245:07.03]And the link has been banned because links are banned.
[245:09.82]Well, shit.
[245:12.14]The link has been deleted because links have been banned temporarily.
[245:17.52]The privilege was removed because of an attempted mutiny on me.
[245:24.64]That's... Unbanned.
[245:27.28]I don't even know what it was.
[245:29.97]He scammed us.
[245:37.07]Release the rats.
[245:37.93]I don't even... It's just three asterisks.
[245:40.33]I don't know.
[245:40.75]I can't... There's no thing to do.
[245:42.31]Charity.
[245:47.93]I'm sorry.
[245:48.97]I'm sorry.
[245:50.04]If you have an image of... If you're still here.
[245:55.58]But you can't.
[245:56.14]You can't.
[245:56.54]I forgot.
[245:56.90]Links are banned.
[245:57.72]Fuck.
[245:58.16]Links are banned.
[245:59.90]Links were banned for three days or so.
[246:03.46]Nothing is temporary on this stream.
[246:04.96]Unban it now or it will last forever.
[246:08.78]I think the whole point of this stream is the entire stream is just everything is temporary.
[246:13.25]Doesn't that make... That's... Everything on this stream is temporary.
[246:18.41]Everything.
[246:20.37]Everything.
[246:24.32]Links shall not be infringed.
[246:27.09]Free the links.
[246:34.13]Well, if one of the mods can get a link to the image, I'll put it up.
[246:38.58]Invictus, if you're still here.
[246:39.56]One of the mods want to put it in the chat if they can.
[246:43.06]If they find it.
[246:45.64]Thank you.
[246:46.12]Invictus, though, sorry we didn't get to see the immediate link.
[246:53.57]Thanks for the $15, nonetheless.
[246:55.89]Hey Drago, Death Knight, thanks for the $5.
[246:57.93]Thank you for being awesome.
[246:59.87]I'm glad you think that way.
[247:01.51]I didn't think I was awesome if you hated me.
[247:03.61]I'd probably feel kind of bad.
[247:04.57]Because I really don't want anyone to hate my guts.
[247:08.12]You know what keeps me up at night?
[247:11.16]Is there anybody out there that really hates me?
[247:13.48]I really hope not.
[247:14.26]Maybe they do.
[247:15.92]Do they?
[247:16.24]I don't know.
[247:18.06]If you do, then I don't know.
[247:19.42]I hope you don't hate me.
[247:22.78]If people dislike me, okay.
[247:24.85]I don't like him.
[247:25.49]I'm not into that.
[247:26.53]I think he's annoying.
[247:27.51]I hope nobody hates my guts.
[247:30.45]I really hope not.
[247:33.26]After the whole lettuce thing, though, I probably made at least a handful of enemies.
[247:38.24]Well, what are you going to do?
[247:43.33]LM man, thanks for the 450.
[247:44.45]Jerma, on a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the general knowledge of chat?
[247:48.05]General knowledge of chat, 10.
[247:50.43]Because chat gets a computer, and they can just literally have every single thing that's ever been known, and they can pretend like they knew it.
[248:01.26]It's actually a great position to be in.
[248:04.20]Because when I don't know the square root of 8, people can go, it's 60, it's 35, idiot.
[248:11.00]Because they just typed it into their fucking other monitor.
[248:13.74]And if I do that, people know.
[248:14.82]And they call me out on cheating and that I don't know.
[248:18.72]So you have all the power in that regard.
[248:20.39]So I would say a 10.
[248:25.57]JPNY, thanks for the $15, JP.
[248:29.19]Jeremiah, me and my friends at Northeastern put a live production of the Rats movie.
[248:33.70]Please give it a watch and let us know what you think.
[248:36.18]It's a banned link.
[248:44.20]Well, community content night is tomorrow, so we could skim through it depending on how long it is.
[248:51.82]Asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.
[248:58.97]I see what your wrath has done my wrath.
[249:02.25]What has your wrath done?
[249:04.07]What has your wrath brought upon this community?
[249:12.79]Uh, we'll find it.
[249:13.49]We'll watch a little bit of it tomorrow.
[249:14.73]See if we can still find it.
[249:17.55]Tomorrow is community content night, so... It would be good there.
[249:22.09]It's my fault.
[249:22.71]It's your fault.
[249:23.17]Isn't that how the game works?
[249:25.07]We just point at each other and yell?
[249:26.13]It's your fault.
[249:28.46]It's your fault.
[249:28.94]No, it's your fault.
[249:29.44]It's your fault.
[249:30.46]Don Detrillo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[249:32.92]Of all the bad games you've played, which would you least like to play again?
[249:38.68]Um...
[249:48.42]Of all the... What constitutes a bad game?
[249:51.58]A game that I didn't like?
[249:52.96]Or a game that was truly awful?
[249:54.92]Like a 4 out of 10 or something.
[250:03.58]One that you didn't like.
[250:04.58]Uh...
[250:12.49]I mean, I probably wouldn't play any of the bad games I've played again, so that's this kind of hard decision to make.
[250:16.81]Uh... I mean, I... The Thing, I mean, I beat The Thing.
[250:28.62]I don't have any reason to play The Thing ever again.
[250:30.32]I beat the whole game.
[250:32.69]The Evil Within?
[250:33.37]Yeah, but The Evil Within's not considered a bad game.
[250:35.35]I just didn't like it.
[250:36.73]Um...
[250:38.92]Probably Odama.
[250:40.30]There's no reason why I would play that again.
[250:41.68]It was just, it was horrendous to me.
[250:47.24]There's no reason for me to go back and play that again.
[250:50.48]For what reason would I ever do it?
[250:53.78]I could somehow, in some stupid weird world, find a way maybe where I could play the evil within.
[250:59.90]But I would never play Odama again.
[251:01.46]So, yeah.
[251:07.11]Thank you for that.
[251:08.55]Glad you think this is fun and funny.
[251:10.52]That's important to me.
[251:11.02]Another game that I have to play.

[253:07.06]Holy shit.
[253:18.95]That sounds horrible.
[253:22.20]That sounds like a horrible thing to do every day.
[253:26.14]I can imagine waking up and being like, fuck, here we go.
[253:30.18]I'm sorry to hear that, whatever the reason was.
[253:35.11]Thanks for the 250, though.
[253:39.66]A sugar shinks thanks for the 250.
[253:42.10]Hi, Jermouse.
[253:43.08]Happy 52nd birthday.
[253:45.10]I know you already have a big list of games you're gonna stream, but have you considered playing Pikmin 1 and 2?
[253:48.70]Yes.
[253:49.96]So I recommend playing the Wii versions.
[253:52.36]Hope you do.
[253:53.52]So I can watch you get all your Pikmin killed to a single fat frog.
[253:57.48]Have a blessed day, King.
[254:00.38]Uh, yeah, I'm gonna play Pikmin 2, the good one, right?
[254:03.54]Pikmin 2 on the Wii, the good one?
[254:05.93]That's the plan.
[254:09.37]Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[254:10.23]So let me get this straight.
[254:11.77]Yeah, this is the potion one.
[254:13.25]That was Gnarly who brought up all the teenager bringing your desktop into the bathroom thing.
[254:17.46]Yep, that was me.
[254:19.08]Thanks for the $2.50, Gnarly, and appreciate the comment.
[254:24.20]Flat McTragic, thanks for the thousand bits.
[254:26.48]Jerma, it's my friend Sam's birthday, so this is from us.
[254:30.56]Love you, idiot.
[254:31.34]Happy birthday.
[254:32.90]Happy birthday.
[254:34.74]To friend Sam.
[254:37.83]Birthday, Sam.
[254:41.13]This is from us.
[254:42.19]I'm assuming that includes you, Flat McTragic.
[254:47.98]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[254:48.76]Happy birthday, Sam.
[254:52.75]Hey Bone Jackal, thanks for the three dollars.
[254:54.63]I started drinking shower water every day like you told us to.
[254:57.75]And for some reason, I began pissing like a sprinkler.
[255:00.53]Starts out with a steady stream, then turns into quick machine gun like bursts.
[255:03.90]You've been experiencing this side effect as well?
[255:05.68]You're drinking the water.
[255:07.99]He's drinking the water.
[255:09.27]That's not what I said.
[255:09.97]I'm haunted by this.
[255:11.57]What does it mean?
[255:13.29]Are dogs not mammals to you?
[255:15.33]What's Otto?
[255:15.99]I said basically?
[255:16.77]No, I said dogs are mammals.
[255:18.93]I didn't say basically mammals, did I?
[255:38.62]I said the dogs are mammals, so it makes sense.
[255:43.06]Well, I don't know.
[255:44.66]Yeah, dogs are mammals.
[255:47.04]And so is the goddamn blue whale.
[255:49.24]Isn't that weird?
[255:52.54]How is that possible?
[255:53.62]It's the only mammal that can breathe underwater.
[255:58.40]The heck is going on there, guys?
[256:03.67]Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[256:04.95]Sorry for exposing your sacred bathroom rituals, but I just thought we needed to address it.
[256:09.75]I love you no matter how weirdly you poop.
[256:11.89]I don't still do this.
[256:15.66]I don't still bring my computer into the bathroom.
[256:24.10]Thank you, Drumajor, for the $2.50.
[256:25.60]They say read, but it might not be suitable to say out loud.
[256:29.73]Okay, let's see.
[256:32.29]Mm-hmm.
[256:35.87]Right, okay.
[256:38.40]Right.
[256:42.28]Okay, well, without getting into the details, they say TL;DR.
[256:48.38]They said that you could be putting unnecessary strain on your asshole.
[256:54.52]I get the appeal of it, they say.
[256:55.62]I used to make music on my laptop years ago when taking a shit.
[256:58.70]Do take care of yourself.
[257:01.90]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[257:04.91]It's okay.
[257:05.33]I'm alright.
[257:06.79]Thanks for the $2.50, though.

[258:03.61]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[258:05.15]Can you say this with a robotic voice?
[258:06.71]It's part of a song by Lemon Demon.
[258:14.62]In the robot voice?
[258:15.56]How does that work?
[258:21.44]Let's see.
[258:24.98]Let's find out.
[258:27.25]This one?
[258:27.99]Okay.
[258:30.21]What does it say?
[258:33.39]Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this record in no way endorses a belief in the occult.
[258:46.20]Does it do that?
[259:03.76]that is that of the song why does it sound weird still what hold on a second what the hello why does this sound do I'm going up and down still is there something still wrong something hold on is something still wrong something's wrong what auto-tune is still on it shouldn't be auto-tune should not be on
[259:33.22]Auto-tune is... No, it wasn't on.
[259:40.65]It was off.
[259:45.51]It was off.
[259:46.73]I don't know.
[259:47.01]It just sounded weird for a second.
[259:49.40]Hey, thanks, SticksRenegade.
[259:50.32]I have no idea what I just said, but hopefully it was Terms of Service friendly.
[259:53.72]Thanks for the $2.50.
[259:54.86]Hey, Milk!
[259:57.10]I got those five community subs from Milk.
[259:58.58]I don't think I caught them.
[259:59.36]No, I did.
[260:00.00]Milk is stant.
[260:00.88]Yeah, I got it.
[260:01.72]I remember.

[260:04.46]Jeremiah, please, please watch a video of African civet cats drinking milk.
[260:11.22]They drink in such a fucked up way, I'm crying over this video.
[260:14.91]Google it.
[260:15.97]I'm begging you.
[260:19.71]Wait, what is it?
[260:23.03]What is this?
[260:23.80]African civet... African civet cat milk?
[260:32.71]They don't know how to drink milk?
[260:35.41]What?
[260:48.54]They think it's food.
[260:49.44]They think it's food.
[260:52.46]They think it's solid.
[260:53.18]Hold on.
[261:12.98]He thinks it's, yeah, they think it's solid.
[261:14.90]He's trying to eat it like dog food.
[261:16.32]He's like, I don't understand.
[261:32.79]He's putting his whole face in.
[261:41.65]Are these raccoons?
[261:42.81]Yeah, they look like... These are cats?
[261:52.20]Huh.
[261:52.94]Interesting.
[261:55.88]Interesting video.
[261:56.50]Thanks for the $5.
[261:56.88]Hey, Yoda.

[262:15.72]OlaVonZombie, thanks for 250.
[262:16.62]You ever been to a Wimpy?
[262:19.22]We had one at a bowling alley that had laser tag.
[262:21.68]Kind of dump of a place.
[262:22.92]A Wimpy.
[262:27.47]No, I've never been to a Wimpy.
[262:36.67]Laser tag.
[262:38.15]I miss a laser tag.
[262:40.26]It was fun.
[262:40.70]Hey, NV11 casting, thanks for the $2.50.
[262:44.68]This is McDLD commercial.
[263:00.80]This McDLT commercial is making me cry laughing.
[263:03.62]I have another commercial like that for you, but I absolutely fucking love it.
[263:07.00]Look up Splash Mountain Wrap.
[263:09.88]It's a real treat and an absolute bop.
[263:14.85]I'm going to be eating food and watching it.
[263:20.81]Let's see.
[263:21.85]Splash Mountain Wrap.
[263:29.78]We're here, we're ready to ride Splash Mountain.
[263:34.34]That's terrifying, by the way.
[263:41.51]We're here, we're ready to ride Splash Mountain.
[263:45.57]But, uh, no, you can't.
[263:47.91]I was told that we could be the first to ride Splash Mountain, and we're ready to go.
[263:51.29]Well, it's not open yet.
[263:54.49]I'm sorry.
[263:55.21]Well, hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry, you guys.
[263:58.09]I don't know what happened.
[264:03.97]Did souls just come out of their body?
[264:27.63]See you guys when this is a Just Dance DLC.
[264:40.71]That's a hard one to do.
[264:41.66]I gotta get five stars to get that one.
[264:44.10]Didn't do that one good.
[264:51.72]Dude, the 80s was fucking crazy.
[264:52.92]Everybody was wearing a clown costume.
[264:56.18]80s fashion was just like big bright colors, big popping reds and blues.
[265:01.02]It was all clown costumes.
[265:03.27]I should have been existing in the 80s.
[265:08.09]Everyone just has like a circus uniform on.
[265:18.11]No, I was born in the 80s, but I wasn't cool in the 80s.
[265:21.21]There's a difference.
[265:25.37]Like, this guy was fucking cool.
[265:27.45]With his, like, purple pants and his, like, clown shoes and his Mickey Mouse shirt.
[265:32.13]Ugh.
[265:39.77]Damn it.
[265:41.19]Well, that was interesting.
[265:43.71]Yeah, that was a pog, I guess.
[265:48.45]Hey, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $2.50.
[265:50.04]Read this off stream.
[265:50.96]Okay.
[265:52.14]Okay.
[265:55.82]Oh, they're saying that links are banned still.
[265:59.15]Because you can't post clips because they're links.
[266:06.49]Fuck.
[266:06.71]Alright, well, don't worry.
[266:08.69]We will alleviate it a little.
[266:11.72]It was just to teach some of these chatters a lesson.
[266:21.26]Approve specific domains.
[266:23.55]Really?
[266:25.12]Well, that sounds pretty interesting to me.
[266:29.60]Quick, clip it!
[266:33.35]But you can't.
[266:36.35]Hey, Vimthral, thanks for the 300 bits.
[266:37.87]The McDonald's song over the Tom and Jerry screaming almost made me choke on a gummy bear laughing.
[266:43.21]Also, my mash joke sucked, and I'm sorry, here's money.
[266:46.35]I don't think the joke was bad.
[266:49.21]I think it was just... Wait, were you talking about the gross mashed potato feet thing?
[266:53.84]It was just gross.
[267:04.06]Hey, shibiriririwa, thanks for 300 bits.
[267:07.36]The McDLT is some of the dumbest shit I've ever seen.
[267:09.09]Also, grilling burgers is the boomer dad way of making a burger.
[267:12.01]They're always dry and taste like ass.
[267:15.49]I can't... I cannot imagine that's a real comment.
[267:20.65]I can't imagine that's a real comment.
[267:23.39]I don't... I don't know.
[267:25.28]I think that that's got to be like a fucking laugh out loud, yell about the moment, I think.
[267:33.05]A burger on the grill is with, like, a good charcoal.
[267:38.28]I'm not sure this... You know what else?
[267:40.18]Listen to me, guys.
[267:41.82]Burger on the grill, that's great.
[267:43.36]I know.
[267:44.06]Like, burger on the grill, that's, like, level one of, like, the fucking super, super intelligence meme thing, right?
[267:50.72]Right at the very end?
[267:52.85]Corn.
[267:54.69]Corn on the cob, slather it in a garlic butter, and just grill it right on the grate.
[268:04.57]Ah, grilling is the best.
[268:06.73]Like, grilling's the best.
[268:09.55]It's like one of my favorite things.
[268:12.45]I can't believe you just said that.
[268:13.89]It was the boomer way to make food.
[268:15.95]Well, how do you make a burger?
[268:16.93]You put it in like a pan?
[268:18.05]I mean, yeah, put it in the pan, I guess.
[268:21.23]But if you have access to a grill, it's just exponentially more flavors.
[268:26.40]There's so much more going on.
[268:27.38]Now, I will give you this.
[268:32.32]Grilling's a pain in the ass.
[268:34.40]Because if you have a charcoal grill, you have to preheat the grill.
[268:40.47]You've got to put the coals in.
[268:41.95]You've got to heat the coals up, dump them in there.
[268:44.13]It's dangerous.
[268:45.65]I get it.
[268:46.91]But it's way better.
[268:47.69]I mean, is that just my opinion?
[268:50.56]I think, I don't know.
[268:51.46]I think it is.
[268:55.65]Yeah, it takes a while.
[268:56.21]It takes like 20 minutes to heat up coals.
[268:59.01]And then it takes a long time for the grill to heat up.
[269:00.79]It's a process.
[269:01.61]But you do it.
[269:02.05]You hang out.
[269:03.55]You get some party hats.
[269:07.15]Get a couple of seats.
[269:09.19]Just hang out outside.
[269:11.55]Get the grill going.
[269:13.69]Make some burgers and dogs, man.
[269:16.55]Get some corn on there.
[269:18.87]Right on the grate.
[269:19.83]Garlic butter.
[269:23.39]Just hang out.
[269:26.58]I said bergs.
[269:27.96]Bergs and dogs, not birds.
[269:30.31]Although you could put chicken on there if you wanted to.
[269:36.99]I'm sorry, I disagree.
[269:39.41]I don't know where you get the idea that burgers on the grill are bad.
[269:44.13]You know that burgers on the grill are good when an entire chain pretends that they do it that way.
[269:51.47]Burger King's whole ad campaign is about pretending to grill their hamburgers.
[270:02.32]Flame broiled.
[270:03.96]Flame grilled.
[270:06.14]Grill.
[270:07.22]Grill marks.
[270:08.72]Flame.
[270:14.96]You don't get a fire in a microwave.
[270:18.72]You don't get a fire in an oven.
[270:21.96]It just doesn't happen.
[270:23.66]And if it does, you've got a big problem.
[270:30.92]Moving on.
[270:33.32]ike turtle thanks for the 250 hey lettuce hater you probably let your burgers sit up for like three hours before you eat them because your weak teeth can't handle fresh lettuce I made this hamburger today and I put lettuce on it because I have strong teeth lettuce lads and it's a deleted link anybody have it anybody get the link stripes beast thanks for 250 Jerm I swear to god the perfect burger you described is the buttery Jack from Jack in the Box
[271:03.56]Your perfect burger is like five bucks.
[271:08.84]No, it's a mushroom and onion Swiss br- No, it's- You- That's not even accurate.
[271:13.97]That's like saying your favorite- Okay, so McDonald's has a fucking bacon cheeseburger.
[271:19.33]Is my favorite burger gonna be from McDonald's?
[271:22.63]The Baconator from fucking Wendy's or whatever.
[271:25.15]Oh yeah, that's my- No.
[271:27.65]There's a version of it that exists that's like a popular way to make a hamburger.
[271:34.00]If you make your own Baconator, it's going to be way better than if you get it from Burger King.
[271:39.42]It's just, it's a difference.
[271:42.82]Did you say, no, it's not?
[271:44.70]What do you mean, no, it's not?
[271:46.46]Wait, if you order a Baconator from Wendy's, and you make your own Baconator on the grill...
[271:55.27]Are you trying to tell me that they're the same?
[271:57.63]I have no, no, no way.
[272:02.46]What?
[272:03.40]Who is saying this?
[272:06.00]There's nobody in this chat actually saying this.
[272:07.94]Have you guys ever made bacon on a grill?
[272:17.15]You can do bacon on the grill.
[272:18.93]I don't know how to do anything.
[272:22.49]I don't know how to cook at all.
[272:24.67]Cooking on the grill is awesome because it's just the caveman fire fucking way to cook.
[272:31.74]Hot.
[272:32.94]It's hot fire.
[272:36.64]Food.
[272:37.72]Burn.
[272:38.38]Flip.
[272:39.36]Done.
[272:40.78]You don't need no shit.
[272:43.65]Smell good.
[272:45.23]Take off fire.
[272:46.19]Eat.
[272:47.45]You don't need to, oh, well, first get a little bit, put some oil and then add a, put a marinade on that and then slip it down over here and you'll get the, and make sure you put, delicately put it in the oven for 15 fucking minutes at 425 degrees.
[273:00.11]Take it out, put it back in the pan.
[273:01.59]No, no, no.
[273:02.37]Fire.
[273:03.87]Burn meat.
[273:06.29]Yes.
[273:06.57]You don't have to know shit.
[273:15.49]It's the best way to cook because it's like you can't really screw it up.
[273:20.60]You could put like literally anything you want and like here's how you tell if something's done on the grill.
[273:30.75]Take it off.
[273:33.01]You eat it.
[273:40.80]You can burn it.
[273:41.94]Yeah, but you don't.
[273:43.32]It's, it's, as long as you follow the directions, you're fine.
[273:48.63]He knows how to cook, he's just lazy.
[273:53.07]But grilling, no, lazy?
[273:56.13]Grilling takes so much prep work.
[273:58.82]It's unbelievable.
[273:59.88]It takes like exponentially, like three times more prep to get a grill going than just to turn the burner on your stove on.
[274:07.25]It's not the lazy way.
[274:08.68]It's the... No, no.
[274:09.46]It's the exceptionally lazy way.
[274:13.28]Because it takes a ton of work to get it going, and then you just sit there while your food just sits on a grill.
[274:20.35]You don't have to do shit.
[274:24.62]You don't use propane.
[274:27.21]I really don't want to start an argument here about how like hardwood versus propane, like wood fire and coals.
[274:34.73]I really don't want to start an argument here, but I could about hardwood and wood grilling and coal grilling versus gas and propane grilling.
[274:43.84]I could start a fight here.
[274:49.46]There ain't nothing in this world.
[274:52.97]There are a few things that really get me going.
[274:58.17]And that can never be compared to.
[275:00.71]And one of them is the sound, smell, and sight of hot coals at the bottom of a grill.
[275:10.14]When you, when they dump in there and they make that like, and the smell is just that hardwood and the sight that just, you see the fire, you see the, the red, the orange hot heat fire.
[275:28.67]Get that grill back on.
[275:31.23]It ain't much like it.
[275:35.22]This is boomer talk.
[275:36.88]No, it's not.
[275:37.78]Come on.
[275:38.56]No way.
[275:39.70]It's like a hot... This is boomer talk.
[275:45.88]Hot coals are just such a... Sure, it is boomer talk.
[275:50.08]You know why?
[275:50.48]Because people were cooking with it like this for fucking hundreds of years.
[275:55.55]They didn't have a button they turned on.
[275:57.37]And this is... You want to call me a boomer?
[275:59.31]This is like super boomer.
[276:01.35]This is like fucking caveman boomer.
[276:04.01]Okay?
[276:04.81]They used to cook on rocks, guys.
[276:06.59]And it just, it's something about it.
[276:08.95]There's so much interesting history with like grilling over hot wood.
[276:12.95]It brings you back to the fucking 1700s.
[276:17.33]When Christopher Columbus made the first Weber grill.
[276:26.87]It had stoves.
[276:28.64]Go back even further.
[276:30.62]Go back to the 1200s.
[276:32.10]They used to cook on rocks on the ground.
[276:36.23]Coals.
[276:37.07]Hot.
[276:37.75]Charcoal.
[276:38.47]Carbon.
[276:42.03]They also had stoves in the 1200s.
[276:43.97]Go back even further.
[276:45.39]Go back to 680.
[276:50.10]The smell, the air was so clean.
[276:52.41]Fresh.
[276:53.87]Hunting.
[276:54.61]And the coals.
[276:55.99]Hot.
[276:56.85]Still stoves.
[276:59.29]When did they not have stoves?
[277:01.11]When did humans not have stoves?
[277:02.61]When did they cook on rocks?
[277:04.02]When was it?
[277:09.24]It was like B.C.
[277:13.42]We've always had stoves.
[277:14.70]No, we have not.
[277:18.67]Before, wait, you're telling me that, you're telling me B.C.
[277:22.37]before Christ, like, Jesus was using a stove?
[277:26.27]That's kind of a weird image, isn't it?
[277:30.67]Like, can you, God, can you picture Jesus, like, cooking macaroni on a stove?
[277:36.89]That's, like, kind of weird, right?
[277:37.97]He's, like, I think about, like, the magical things that I've written about him.
[277:41.66]And he's, like, just sitting there stirring, like, food, like, stirring, like, fucking macaroni and cheese.
[277:48.02]Huh.
[277:49.25]Macaroni wasn't invented yet.
[277:51.46]Go back then.
[277:53.52]No, go forward and then go back.
[277:55.76]Go forward and get a box of mac and cheese and go back to fucking 2 AD and get it on those hot coals.
[278:02.84]The point still stands.
[278:03.98]There ain't nothing like hot fucking rocks and wood that's cooking your food.
[278:09.49]And the best part?
[278:11.09]The smell doesn't leave your body for two weeks.
[278:16.25]You will run your fingers through your hair and you will just be like, why does it smell like an ashtray in my hand?
[278:23.75]But it's a good ashtray.
[278:25.20]It's like a hardwood.
[278:26.34]It's a carbon.
[278:27.26]It's a heat.
[278:29.46]It's a strong, hot smell.
[278:32.70]Okay.
[278:33.62]Moving on.
[278:36.56]It's a strong, hot ashtray.
[278:42.37]Just nuke your food in the microwave.
[278:47.71]We already went over the fact that can you cook a full turkey in the microwave?
[278:55.30]Makes me laugh.
[278:57.44]How long?
[278:58.66]Do we even come to a determination how long?
[279:02.22]What would the time be?
[279:03.04]Like, 70 minutes?
[279:04.04]Like, 60 minutes in the microwave?
[279:10.40]I know, the Mr. Bean thing.
[279:11.76]But seriously, like, what would it actually do at, like, low power?
[279:16.62]One minute on max power.
[279:22.86]Probably 40 minutes at, like, 2 out of 10.
[279:30.03]Would it explode?
[279:33.29]Not at minimum power, right?
[279:36.69]It would be 7 to 9 minutes per pound.
[279:39.54]So you're talking about, like, more than an hour at low power in the microwave.
[279:46.80]It...
[279:51.65]It would be cold inside.
[279:52.77]It would just be raw.
[279:55.67]It would just be steam it.
[279:57.29]Can you steam a turkey?
[280:00.85]How would you steam a turkey?
[280:06.85]You can steam a turkey.
[280:10.88]Easy bake oven turkey.
[280:13.46]A boiled turkey.
[280:14.92]Oh my god.
[280:17.40]Oh, that's that does not sound good.
[280:26.04]Anyways, let's run the credits.
[280:29.21]Thanks for sticking around.
[280:29.97]We'll see you tomorrow for community content night.
[280:35.13]Boiling a turkey.
[280:37.59]It would hurt to bite into that.
[280:39.27]You'd break your teeth.
[280:39.93]It would be hard.
[280:40.85]It would be a rock.
[280:47.00]Thanks, Will.
[280:47.34]We had some huge sub drops today.
[280:49.93]So, thank you for dropping them.
[280:52.11]Freddy came in with 50 community subs.
[280:54.79]We had 20 from SuperBruce.
[280:57.75]We had 10, 10, 10.
[280:58.89]None of you guys.
[281:01.65]Thank you.
[281:02.47]A shitload of people.
[281:06.15]Thanks for the huge amount of support.
[281:09.87]Thanks, guys.
[281:14.73]Anyways, Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[281:17.61]Lettuce gives you very little nutritional value.
[281:19.65]It's just crunchy water.
[281:20.99]Why eat it?
[281:22.47]I eat meat.
[281:23.17]I ain't no fucking... I ain't eating no fucking salad.
[281:25.77]I'm no hippie hipster.
[281:27.13]Fuck all that shit.
[281:27.95]Give me a big-ass chicken sandwich with lots of mayo and ketchup.
[281:30.51]That's the good shit.
[281:31.69]And yes, I do like ketchup and mayo on a chicken sandwich.
[281:34.53]Sandwich, shut up, chat.
[281:37.87]Okay, now that's a boomer.
[281:39.13]That's the boomer way.
[281:40.83]Jerma, are you, like, using a grill?
[281:42.98]What are you, fucking 50?
[281:49.99]I will tell you, Hayley, there is a lot of nutritional value in some vegetables.
[281:55.42]We're talking mushrooms.
[281:56.52]We're talking onions.
[281:57.70]We're talking putting them in the pan with a little bit of butter and a little bit of oil.
[282:01.48]Let them get happy together.
[282:02.96]Take that slurry.
[282:04.02]Put it on a bun.
[282:05.06]Put that bun on top of a burger.
[282:06.86]Put that burger on top of your mouth and eat it.
[282:11.22]Mushrooms aren't a vegetable.
[282:23.09]Oh.
[282:24.75]You know what I've come to realize?
[282:25.63]I don't really like vegetables.
[282:28.71]That's weird.
[282:29.39]Listen to me.
[282:30.57]I'm a bean guy.
[282:34.50]I'm a bean and fungus guy.
[282:36.36]I'm a bean, fungus, and shallot.
[282:42.10]I love garbanzo beans.
[282:43.18]I love kidney beans.
[282:43.88]I love black beans.
[282:45.08]I love beans.
[282:46.06]I love them.
[282:46.56]I love legumes.
[282:48.60]I love legumes.
[282:51.38]I love them.
[282:52.74]I love mushrooms.
[282:54.22]I love onions.
[282:55.09]I love garlic.
[282:55.83]It's one of my favorite things in the world.
[282:56.93]Garlic.
[282:59.03]I thought I'm not a vegetables guy, huh?
[283:02.65]I don't like lettuce.
[283:03.23]I don't like tomatoes.
[283:04.95]I don't like eggplants.
[283:05.79]I don't like zucchini.
[283:07.61]It's gross.
[283:09.73]Huh.
[283:12.39]I don't like potatoes, really.
[283:13.69]Potatoes, I don't like them.
[283:15.13]I do like asparagus, though.
[283:16.89]Is asparagus vegetable or is that a fucking fungus?
[283:19.70]I'm kidding.
[283:20.00]I'm kidding.
[283:27.16]You like avocado?
[283:27.86]I like avocados.
[283:29.54]Not every day, but I do like them.
[283:37.09]Oh, yeah.
[283:37.65]I'm a fungus and bean guy with the weird shit that grows in the ground that makes your eyes hurt.
[283:44.69]Green onions, onions, garlic, shallots.
[283:47.05]Yeah.
[283:48.65]I'm not like a true, truly vegetable kind of guy.
[283:51.70]I eat them, but I don't love them.
[283:55.68]I do like fruits too, I love bananas.
[283:57.18]As you know, I eat bananas all the time.
[284:00.95]I'm a big banana fan.
[284:05.77]I don't like sweet potatoes.
[284:07.75]I find them to be odd.
[284:16.83]Sweet potatoes are... There's one place that I like sweet potato.
[284:22.11]And I might be even wrong.
[284:24.93]What's that dish that's at Thanksgiving where it's the really, really mushed up sweet potato with the marshmallow on top?
[284:35.76]Yams.
[284:36.96]Those are sweet potatoes, right?
[284:39.38]Candied yams.
[284:40.04]There it is.
[284:40.54]Candied yams.
[284:42.88]They're very good.
[284:46.86]It's that the yams mashed up hot with the marshmallow on top.
[284:50.15]It's phenomenal.
[284:52.27]I don't like sweet potato fries, sweet potato this, sweet potato that, sweet potato bread, sweet potato, sweet potato, sweet potato.
[284:58.12]People put it in everything.
[284:58.84]It's like the new avocado.
[285:02.68]Before, people put avocado in everything.
[285:04.18]Now they put sweet potato on everything or part of everything.
[285:10.75]You would open up a menu at a restaurant.
[285:12.13]It's like, oh, avocado here, avocado there.
[285:15.03]We've got avocados on this.
[285:16.29]There's avocado here.
[285:17.15]And it's like, okay.
[285:18.37]Now open a menu.
[285:19.67]Sweet potato on there.
[285:20.95]Sweet potato fries.
[285:22.05]We've got sweet potato mash.
[285:23.21]Sweet potatoes.
[285:25.61]Eh.
[285:32.24]Handed yams are a disgrace.
[285:33.56]Why?
[285:37.54]Pretzel buns.
[285:38.26]Fantastic.
[285:39.56]I'm glad you said that.
[285:45.23]They taste like poop.
[285:47.03]Why do you know what that is?
[285:50.17]Why are you comparing your... What?
[285:55.61]Anyways, Peaceful Haley, there are some vegetables and some beans and shallots.
[286:02.30]Especially beans.
[286:02.90]Garbanzo beans.
[286:03.54]Hummus is my... I could eat hummus until I died.
[286:06.98]If you told me if the devil broke up from the ground, I'd...
[286:15.13]Yeah.
[286:18.21]Oh, this is not a devil voice.
[286:20.19]Sorry, I'm having a little bit of a cold.
[286:23.77]There we are.
[286:28.97]No, not quite.
[286:30.27]Why does it sound so strange?
[286:33.02]Oh, okay.
[286:34.20]Jeremy.
[286:38.06]for the next three years you can only consume garlic hummus oh I have ruined your life haven't I no that sounds great do I get to literally eat any other food no only garlic hummus it is the only thing you can eat what do I get for doing this
[287:07.47]Well, if you're everlasting soul for one and two, I'll give you 2,000 Bitcoin.
[287:14.12]That sounds good to me.
[287:14.86]Sure, sign me up.
[287:15.62]I would love to.
[287:17.70]Ooh, I'm going to get another one.
[287:20.22]I'm going to get another soul.
[287:22.00]2,000 BTC is a lot of fucking money.
[287:27.64]No, I can do it.
[287:28.14]I can literally do it.
[287:29.88]I can eat hummus every single day.
[287:32.30]Garlic hummus, Mediterranean hummus, roasted red pepper hummus.
[287:35.71]We've got like olive hummus.
[287:36.79]We've got like cheddar hummus.
[287:37.95]There's so many different variations.
[287:39.87]I love it.
[287:40.19]It's so good.
[287:41.09]If you've never had hummus before, Cedar's a good brand.
[287:45.73]Tribe is a good brand.
[287:46.69]Tribe is a great hummus brand.
[287:50.91]They're all great.
[287:52.19]But nothing else?
[287:53.31]Wait a minute.
[287:54.23]Hold on.
[287:54.47]Is there bread involved?
[287:56.39]Is there bread involved?
[287:57.03]Can I eat this with bread?
[287:58.03]Hey, what?
[288:04.44]There was nothing in the contract that said it was gonna be bread here, my friend.
[288:10.94]You done just fucked up.
[288:15.28]No!
[288:16.18]No!
[288:16.76]Hey, thank you, HackItFast, for the thousand bits.
[288:24.89]Remember, my friends introduced me to you years ago, and I used to think that your videos were just alright.
[288:30.01]That's okay.
[288:31.39]But as I familiarize myself with you and I find myself watching your VODs and live streams almost daily, your videos are the perfect way to end my day after my 9-5 job and especially help during these stressful and uncertain times.
[288:42.74]Just want to mention that if I ever have a conversation with you in real life, I will never ask you about hamburgers.
[288:47.64]And I'm very skeptical of Hash House.
[288:52.70]Though do not be skeptical of Hash House, Ogogo.
[288:55.33]At the link.
[288:58.21]Everything there is good.
[288:59.33]If you don't like hamburgers, it doesn't matter.
[289:02.11]They have this meatloaf sandwich thing there.
[289:05.65]Oh my goodness.
[289:08.62]It's so good.
[289:09.38]It's the best thing ever.
[289:11.62]It's the best restaurant on Earth.
[289:19.77]It's so fucking good.
[289:23.22]That hamburger, the burger is just, it's like a big, but it's thin.
[289:27.90]It's huge, but it's thin patties.
[289:30.20]There's two thin, big patties and they're just perfect.
[289:39.35]Where is the link?
[289:42.03]The link is on the Las Vegas strip.
[289:46.49]Kind of right in the middle.
[289:50.93]But thank you, HackItFast, for the thousand bits.
[289:53.83]Thanks for hanging out.
[289:57.87]Hey, Goiki, thanks for the five dollars.
[289:59.29]Hi, BurgerGuy again.
[290:00.94]I've been told I'm a maniac because of how I eat things.
[290:03.54]Like I only eat the meat on the burger and no bun or anything else.
[290:06.90]And also slathered in mustard.
[290:09.68]Also, I eat tomatoes like apples.
[290:12.32]There's something wrong with me.
[290:15.76]Um... Maniac.
[290:18.90]I'm not sure that's a maniac thing.
[290:21.65]I think that's a... I mean, that's a thing people do on diets, don't they?
[290:26.09]That's like a low-carb diet.
[290:31.69]Is mustard allowed on a low-carb diet?
[290:33.62]I mean, people do that?
[290:37.02]That's a mustard diet.
[290:38.18]Shut up, he's a maniac.
[290:43.50]You are a dog that was raised as a human.
[290:46.02]What the fuck?
[290:49.12]Hey...
[290:51.13]Hey, Milkistan, thanks for the $1,050, $10.50, $10.50.
[290:54.44]You're the only streamer I've actually donated this much money to.
[291:00.56]And even $10 is a lot of money to give to anybody, especially a random e-clown.
[291:07.84]So thank you.
[291:09.06]Your content has helped inspired me and got me out of a negative headspace these last few months.
[291:13.20]My boyfriend and I almost went homeless, but things are picking up.
[291:16.76]I got a full-time job now and that one that I really enjoy.
[291:20.16]And you've inspired me to make art again.
[291:22.58]Thanks for what you do.
[291:23.42]My outlook on the future has become more hopeful.
[291:25.61]That's awesome.
[291:26.17]That's very good.
[291:28.79]I'm really, that's awesome to hear.
[291:35.71]Whatever you're doing for your job, hopefully you enjoy it.
[291:41.16]You say you do, whatever it is, keep doing it.
[291:45.50]And keep trucking.
[291:48.66]Thank you so much for the thousand bits.
[291:53.46]Good luck.
[291:55.48]I wish you the best.
[291:59.90]Peaceful Haley gave five community subs.
[292:02.85]Just dropped them.
[292:05.32]Right there.
[292:06.26]Thank you, Hayley.
[292:09.36]Appreciate the five subs.
[292:12.46]Catboy, if 250, why call it Big Lettuce when you can call it the Romain Empire?
[292:21.03]Oh.
[292:22.83]Damn.
[292:23.39]Can I go back and delete the VOD and restream the whole stream and we'll do the same thing and get to that one point and I'll say that?
[292:30.27]Also, let your anime of the year be Hunter x Hunter King.
[292:35.66]That's going to be a tough one.
[292:36.98]We're in 2020.
[292:38.64]I've got to figure out what my anime of the year is going to be.
[292:41.17]It's true.
[292:43.11]There's been quite a few suggestions.
[292:45.97]Jack the Mac, thanks for $5.
[292:47.41]I'm sorry that you were getting old.
[292:48.49]Jerma arthritis sucks.
[292:50.11]I'm not sure if that's it yet.
[292:53.64]We don't... I don't know.
[292:56.50]It's either rheumatoid arthritis or I have intercostal nerve damage somehow.
[293:05.15]which I kind of know maybe how it happened but I don't know a thousand percent I don't know and I don't I don't want to talk about medical stuff I do sometimes unless I kind of know what I'm saying and if I'm saying is true I don't want to be like well guys this is the thing that I have I don't want to do that I'd rather just do it and see what happens
[293:34.43]It has nothing to do with an injury, I will tell you.
[293:37.11]It's not an injury thing.
[293:45.93]I will maybe have some more info, hopefully, if it turns out that's what it was.
[293:50.30]But I don't know.
[293:53.28]Right now, I've been diagnosed with costochondritis.
[293:56.66]That's the diagnosis that's there now.
[293:59.16]And then, wait a minute, hold on.
[294:00.63]We did another test, and...
[294:03.71]You might have RA.
[294:05.41]You might have rheumatoid arthritis.
[294:07.45]This thing is high.
[294:08.19]You've got to come back and we've got to recheck this.
[294:11.39]Okay.
[294:15.27]We'll see.
[294:18.17]But thank you, Wolf, for the $2.50 Jerm.
[294:20.23]Thanks for the good times as always.
[294:21.33]We sure do need them right now.
[294:23.07]My mom found out yesterday that she had a sister she never knew.
[294:26.01]And we found out today that she had passed away in her apartment of COVID-19.
[294:29.81]That's terrible.
[294:32.93]I don't know what else to say other than I hope you and all the chat are staying safe and sanitized out there.
[294:37.15]Very trying times we're in right now.
[294:39.54]You and your content helps me get through it all.
[294:42.18]I know a lot of chat feels the same.
[294:46.14]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[294:47.24]That's finding out that you have a sister you never knew and then that she passed away.
[294:54.64]That's sort of two very, very kind of Earth-shaking things.
[294:58.95]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[295:04.76]But thanks for the $2.50, and stay safe.
[295:06.92]I wish you and your family the best.
[295:12.80]We are almost at the end of the bits here.
[295:14.16]We had 500 bits from Batmom.
[295:16.68]Thank you, Batmom.
[295:18.66]$2.50 from Rosie Breyer.
[295:20.32]Get well soon, Jerma.
[295:21.52]I'm doing alright.
[295:22.06]I'm doing just fine.
[295:23.76]I'm good.
[295:25.50]Thank you.
[295:25.96]Appreciate the concern.
[295:27.96]Guillotine Senpai, thanks for $5.64.
[295:29.16]Ponder this, streamer.
[295:32.01]A burger with the meat marinated, not dipped, in barbecue sauce and a fried egg.
[295:36.22]Uh, I'm gonna, I have to stop you right there.
[295:41.34]I'm sorry, I have to stop you there.
[295:43.87]I don't like egg.
[295:44.57]I don't like egg on my meat.
[295:47.69]Uh.
[295:49.14]I don't like the, no, I'm sorry.
[295:51.12]I'm not an egg.
[295:51.68]I'm not a fried egg on burger guy.
[295:53.74]I know people love it, but it's a, it's a textural thing for me because when you bite into the egg and if the egg starts to run and then all you got a problem with the egg running and it's runny egg in your burger, I know people love it.
[296:09.74]And it's a huge, like Kim loves that shit.
[296:13.33]She's a huge fan of that, but I'm, I'm not really that big of an egg guy either.
[296:20.12]I like hard-boiled eggs.
[296:21.24]I don't like runny eggs.
[296:22.40]I think that's my problem.
[296:26.46]I like a jammy egg.
[296:31.16]But most places that do egg on a burger, it's deliberately, in my opinion, and not even my opinion, it's actually deliberately, well, make sure it's a big runny egg.
[296:42.23]Bite into it and get the fucking egg all over you.
[296:45.59]It's like deliberate.
[296:46.21]They do it on purpose.
[296:48.51]That's every restaurant I've ever been to.
[296:51.35]Doesn't like that.
[296:53.64]But maybe I would like it if it was a jammy kind of medium, over medium egg rather than over easy.
[297:03.30]Maybe I would like it.
[297:04.50]But I just don't like the runny egg.
[297:05.54]It's a textural thing.
[297:07.46]Also, have you ever considered playing Metro Exodus?
[297:10.42]It can be finished in three streams.
[297:12.12]Yeah, I thought about it.
[297:12.82]I played, I beat Metro 2033 on stream.
[297:16.31]And then I had a meltdown in the first 30 minutes of Last Light and vowed to never play the whole series ever again for some reason.
[297:25.41]I don't, I have no idea.
[297:26.55]And it was like, it was kind of like the Halo scenario where I had such like a bad stream kind of moment that like the game is now fucking ruined because like the stream I was like so fucked up and so like annoyed or I couldn't like do the first mission or something.
[297:42.98]And now like the game is ruined for me.
[297:45.14]It's weird how that works.
[297:47.76]He's just traumatized.
[297:52.25]But maybe when, maybe eventually, I don't know.
[297:55.13]I'd have to play Last Light first.
[297:56.53]Because 2033 was good.
[298:02.20]It was a lot of fun, and I beat it.
[298:06.51]I'm assuming I would like the next one.
[298:07.87]I just had a huge issue for some reason that day.
[298:11.88]Hey Bulbaswag, thanks for the $5.
[298:13.32]Russian Car Driver is the best worst game I've ever played.
[298:16.97]Full of awful translations and poorly designed UI.
[298:19.49]I would recommend it.
[298:21.19]Russian Car Driver.
[298:25.44]Never heard of it.
[298:28.76]Hey Addison, thanks for the $3.
[298:29.60]Hey Jerma.
[298:31.56]I've been loving listening to your streams while playing Animal Crossing lately.
[298:35.01]Have you played any more with Kim?
[298:38.05]Actually, no.
[298:39.69]I have not.
[298:40.15]I have not played any Animal Crossing.
[298:42.07]There hasn't really been a whole lot of time.
[298:45.39]Just recently have Kim and I really started to settle.
[298:48.61]And there hasn't been something crazy that needs to be set up or done.
[298:54.32]So maybe now that these last like a few days.
[298:59.14]But no, I haven't played it.
[299:01.67]The villagers all moved.
[299:03.17]Does that happen?
[299:03.97]Oh, well.
[299:04.67]I'll get new ones.
[299:06.73]Anything else show official?
[299:07.73]Thanks for the $5.
[299:08.11]Hey, Jerma.
[299:09.67]When will you do the public domain movie night?
[299:11.89]Two days.
[299:12.77]And what weird movies and games do you think are underrated?
[299:15.73]I want to find something new to do during the quarantine.
[299:19.33]Any movies and games that I think are underrated?
[299:21.97]Hmm.
[299:24.02]Friday is the public domain movie night.
[299:28.82]But stuff to do that's weird or underrated.
[299:36.60]Watch Ghostbusters 1 and 2.
[299:38.98]Watch Gremlins 2, especially.
[299:41.69]If you haven't seen Gremlins 1 and 2, watch them today.
[299:48.99]I would say Gremlins is a pretty underrated series.
[299:53.96]Kirby enthusiasm is pretty is a pretty highly rated series a lot of people know about that underrated Ghostbusters Not a movie well they said movies and games.
[300:08.84]I'm doing the movies part first I
[300:14.14]Games?
[300:14.56]I mean, the easiest one to say is Sorcery.
[300:16.72]I think that's the criminally most underrated experience.
[300:21.28]Although it can be kind of frustrating if you weren't around years ago.
[300:26.00]Sorcery is probably the most underrated experience for a game.
[300:33.02]Herb Your Enthusiasm is my favorite Soulsborne game.
[300:40.59]I don't know.
[300:41.15]Besides that,
[300:45.84]I don't know.
[300:47.62]All the games that are underrated that I play or liked.
[300:51.84]I've played so many games, it's like hard to keep track sometimes.
[300:54.44]There are games that I forgot that I've played.
[300:57.36]That actually happened recently.
[301:00.04]I think somebody brought it up in this stream.
[301:01.26]I was talking about like playing it and somebody was like, hey, I think you did that.
[301:04.01]I'm like, maybe like a month ago somebody said it.
[301:06.13]What was the game that I said that I didn't know that I played already?
[301:12.73]Oh, Enter the Gungeon.
[301:13.25]Yeah, Enter the Gungeon.
[301:15.31]I streamed it.
[301:18.45]And I'm like, maybe I'll check that out.
[301:20.13]He's like, dude, you already did that.
[301:22.23]Well, I did.
[301:24.41]I can't check it out?
[301:26.25]Yeah, that happened.
[301:26.73]What do they do?
[301:31.38]They come up and they go... And they go back down for like four hours?
[301:46.44]That's kind of cool.
[301:47.74]What a fucking badass mammal.
[301:50.67]What a badass mammal.
[301:54.21]And they also go like this.
[302:02.25]That's pretty cool.
[302:09.54]Hey Pigeon, thanks for the $2.50.
[302:10.52]I probably should have mentioned that I was like 10 at the time of the great shitholding.
[302:15.44]I assumed.
[302:19.00]RIP Alex Trebek, thanks for the $5.
[302:21.10]You have a great stream today.
[302:23.28]You don't have to read my name if you don't want to.
[302:24.98]Oh, because I remember last time.
[302:28.52]Last time, I, yeah.
[302:30.60]I was wondering if you could help me with tax advice.
[302:34.62]I'm 23 and I've never done my taxes.
[302:36.69]Do I need to do them?
[302:38.61]Am I going to get in trouble?
[302:41.05]XOXO, tell Otto I said hello stinky.
[302:47.27]Okay, let me help you here.
[302:50.16]Did you have income in 2019?
[302:54.62]If the answer is yes, you, yeah, you do.
[303:01.30]Am I going to get in trouble?
[303:02.38]Well, that all depends.
[303:06.03]That all depends on if you claim your car as a dependent.
[303:10.65]I would recommend against not doing that.
[303:18.82]But you should file taxes.
[303:20.09]I would recommend getting in touch with a certified public accountant, a CPA.
[303:25.51]Or if you're worried about potentially, wait, I had a bunch of money that I didn't pay taxes on, you get a CPA and help you out with it.
[303:37.98]Just use TurboTax.
[303:42.69]Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.
[303:49.79]But if you don't... You can make mistakes on TurboTax.
[303:52.77]You have to be careful.
[303:58.43]Some people can potentially make mistakes on there.
[304:04.71]Just don't make mistakes.
[304:07.59]Yeah.
[304:13.45]But if you had income last year, yes, I highly advise you filing a return.
[304:17.48]Although, hey, I will tell you, the date to file a return has been extended in the United States, I believe to July 15th.
[304:23.90]It usually is April 15th is tax day.
[304:27.10]It is now July 15th, apparently.
[304:28.64]So got some time to figure that out if you haven't done it.
[304:35.30]Good luck.
[304:36.80]Yes, you have to pay your fucking, yes, you have to pay your taxes.
[304:40.84]And no, you're not going to get in trouble as long as you don't lie to the IRS.
[304:46.46]Anyways.
[304:48.39]Thank you, MothPriest, for the 250.
[304:51.79]Jerma, I want to let you know you always make me laugh so hard and always make my day better.
[304:57.08]Thanks for doing what you do.
[304:57.88]Thanks for the incredibly nice message.
[304:59.42]Appreciate it.
[305:01.80]Lizard4000, thanks for the 300 bits.
[305:05.30]Hey, Jerma.
[305:05.92]RatsInstagibDev here.
[305:08.60]Can you remember?
[305:09.58]Of course I do.
[305:11.12]I just sent you an email about a new game I'm working on.
[305:13.38]I hope you can look at it sometime.
[305:14.66]Best regards.
[305:15.31]Really?
[305:15.45]Really?
[305:18.08]I will have to.
[305:18.80]Well, did you send it to the Jerma email that's on YouTube?
[305:31.05]You probably could throw a paper airplane and it would get here faster than I would read that.
[305:38.47]Hit up one of the mods.
[305:44.06]And let them know some details.
[305:47.20]And maybe we can get in touch through Discord.
[305:49.19]Discord's a lot easier for me at this point.
[305:51.69]But that sounds pretty cool.
[305:53.61]Looking forward to it.
[305:54.87]I'll take a look.
[305:56.71]This is not a guarantee that I'm going to play the game.
[305:58.33]This is not a guarantee that I'm going to play that game.
[306:00.75]I'm going to look into it.
[306:02.97]It's going to be fun.
[306:04.23]It's going to be cool.
[306:04.87]It's going to be interesting.
[306:06.49]It's going to be cool.
[306:09.29]And I've got to be into it.
[306:10.95]Okay.
[306:11.77]Just want to make sure we're aware of this.
[306:16.27]You just rejected him.
[306:17.39]No, I didn't.
[306:18.19]No, I didn't.
[306:18.87]I've got to be clear.
[306:23.49]No pressure.
[306:27.44]No, I'm sure it's going to be fun.
[306:28.80]I'm just fucking around.
[306:30.08]Don't worry.
[306:30.88]Hey, Yoda985, thanks for the $2.50.
[306:33.36]Damn, those African civet cats really be like... And then they did jermaChomp and then Milk Twitter.
[306:42.60]Yeah, that's... That's true.
[306:49.11]milk uh milk emoji Twitter emoji of milk well I don't know what this is yeah what's that it's why does it say Twitter Twitter emoji of and then it's a bottle it says Twitter emoji of milk I don't get it why does it say that why does it say Twitter emoji I don't know that's weird
[307:14.03]A freak ate out.
[307:15.85]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[307:16.71]Hey, Jeremy, watch this.
[307:17.46]It's Arnold Schwarzenegger reading the book of Genesis.
[307:23.30]Why do I want to watch this?
[307:30.29]Click it.
[307:30.69]I just did.
[307:31.35]Hold on.
[307:41.96]and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waiters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night I I have screamed from the mountaintops how terrifying this is
[308:12.54]Because you and I think this is funny.
[308:16.72]But your grandparents will think that's real.
[308:27.62]Here comes the rant.
[308:30.60]Here comes the boomer rant?
[308:33.72]What?
[308:34.48]No, I've already done it.
[308:37.10]But thanks for that book of Genesis.
[308:38.56]Appreciate it.
[308:41.33]Hey, Stripes Beast, thanks for 250.
[308:42.91]By the way, somebody says boomers are on their way out anyways.
[308:47.32]You've got some time.
[308:50.80]You've got... You've got a long... You've got time here.
[308:54.48]You've got at least 20 to 30 years.
[309:02.26]At least.
[309:03.61]So, I mean, if you think that boomers are on their way out by July...
[309:09.30]Um, so I've got news for you that probably about 20 years.
[309:11.76]You're going to be like 40 by then.
[309:14.76]You'll be a fucking boomer by then.
[309:25.99]Ah, shit.
[309:28.19]Shit.
[309:29.25]No, not me.
[309:30.93]Not me.
[309:39.94]I will never be a boomer.
[309:41.54]Hey, Crispy Scooch, thanks for 300 bits.
[309:52.71]Hey, Jerm, just a heads up that the source codes for TF2 and CSGO have been leaked.
[309:57.77]So if you play them, you could get a virus.
[309:59.65]What?
[310:02.08]How does that make any sense?
[310:03.42]What?
[310:05.46]The source code for TF2 is leaked.
[310:07.26]If you play TF2, you'll get a virus.
[310:12.32]I don't get it.
[310:17.22]What, so somebody just will make their own TF2?
[310:19.58]Wouldn't that mean that, like, somebody has to make their own TF2 and inject it with something bad?
[310:29.13]How would they... No.
[310:38.76]People are finding ways... People are finding out a way to remote code execute.
[310:43.51]Oh.
[310:47.51]Valve said you don't need to worry about it.
[310:53.07]Oh.
[310:54.09]Well, let's hope there's not a problem.
[310:57.16]That sounds kind of insane.
[311:01.22]Source code is almost two years old, and Valve themselves have said there's no cause for alarm at this point.
[311:06.66]Oh.
[311:09.31]Well, somebody get fucking Norton on it.
[311:13.67]Somebody call Norton!
[311:18.15]Um, that's kind of fucking horrible if that's true.
[311:24.56]Well, TF2 hasn't updated in three years, so, uh... Hey, Stripesbeast, thanks for $2.50.
[311:34.72]Oh, so the last supper was Jesus showing off his grilling skills for the boys.
[311:43.67]Hey, Trans Scout, thanks for the five dollars.
[311:46.37]How about a ketchup sandwich?
[311:48.03]Ketchup is okay in certain random places.
[311:50.58]I'm not a huge fan of it in a lot of places, though.
[311:52.40]I'm not a fan of tomatoes.
[311:53.72]I just don't like tomatoes.
[311:58.65]Hey, Razzle, thanks for the 250.
[311:59.95]Jerma, you started this whole YouTube streaming career as a normal guy.
[312:03.49]And through your success, you've kind of been pushed into this huge influential position that people look to for support.
[312:08.61]Does that stress you out at all?
[312:12.14]Um... Not really.
[312:15.10]Because I think I've been very clear from the very beginning that...
[312:21.19]I've kind of just been doing this one thing that I think is fun.
[312:25.79]And I really try not to inject very much more than my intentions here.
[312:34.16]So we make a lot of jokes and we fuck around a lot here.
[312:38.38]But I never want to get to a point where I'm kind of... It's been like this for a decade.
[312:42.45]A decade.
[312:45.17]I don't... I want it to be fun, and I want it to be just something that I like to do.
[312:51.44]And when you talk about, like, influential positions looking for support, I've made it pretty clear that I'm just kind of a guy.
[312:57.16]And I don't hold very many large... I don't hold very many...
[313:11.99]like when people ask me for advice I always say like I'll give you some the best I can but I'm not somebody that can I'm just a guy that likes to have fun and that's kind of been the mantra since like 2012. but if I can influence you to stop eating gross lettuce on your hamburgers then oh I'm gonna use it but no it doesn't stress me out I think everyone here has an understanding that this is just a fun community
[313:37.47]There's not very much pressure on this community or on me, really.
[313:42.37]And it's kind of been designed that way from the beginning.
[313:47.88]Guy equals vessel.
[313:50.66]Right, whatever.
[313:58.99]Yeah, no, it's all good.
[314:03.59]We have only a couple more to do.
[314:04.81]We have Westule.
[314:05.75]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[314:06.75]$10.
[314:06.85]Jeremy, you have the absolute best chat on Twitch.
[314:09.24]Can we get a round of applause for chat?
[314:10.68]Sure.
[314:16.92]What is this in Morse code?
[314:19.45]Can somebody do Morse code here?
[314:20.45]Ready?
[314:20.97]What is this?
[314:35.56]What'd I say?
[314:42.83]You're pissing my cat off.
[314:45.76]I'm sorry.
[314:47.81]Hey, stream beyond.
[314:49.43]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[314:50.23]Best of luck with whatever's ailing you, Jerma.
[314:52.39]Also, I agree that lettuce on burgers is a travesty.
[314:55.28]Often it ends up piling all the toppings off with it.
[314:58.00]Yes.
[314:58.94]No matter the strength of your teeth, it brings any delicious burger down with it.
[315:02.54]No wonder it's called iceberg lettuce.
[315:05.14]Much like the iceberg to the Titanic.
[315:07.94]Monkey ass.
[315:10.68]Damn.
[315:11.38]Didn't even think about that.
[315:15.28]A pink goat?
[315:17.61]Thanks for the $5 as we ended here.
[315:22.77]Thank you, Pink Goat.
[315:23.45]They say, Hi, Jerm.
[315:24.05]The reason I absolutely hate candied yams is because I cannot understand why anyone would put marshmallow on top of vegetables.
[315:29.77]Also, plain sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods next to salmon sashimi.
[315:33.49]Love ya.
[315:35.37]Because they're sweet.
[315:36.93]They're sweet.
[315:38.01]Sweet potatoes are sweet and they're ground up and then marshmallow.
[315:40.95]I just love marshmallow.
[315:41.77]Marshmallow is like my favorite candy thing.
[315:44.62]Reese's, and whipped marshmallow.
[315:51.40]I love it.
[315:53.30]And I know where it came from.
[315:55.39]We talked about Ghostbusters.
[315:57.59]When I was a kid, the part, and this is kind of like fucked up, I guess, but, and this is a spoiler for Ghostbusters.
[316:04.09]If you've never seen Ghostbusters before, the stream's over, and this is the last bit here.
[316:08.93]So, goodnight.
[316:10.35]We'll see you later.
[316:11.45]This is a spoiler for Ghostbusters.
[316:13.57]Okay, see you tomorrow.
[316:16.67]Okay.
[316:18.35]When they kill the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and he explodes all over everything, and his like marshmallow cream goes all over the whole place.
[316:30.18]It goes everywhere.
[316:33.26]I wanted to eat it so bad, and I knew what it tasted like, and I wanted it so bad.
[316:37.71]It was all over them.
[316:39.67]They had cream.
[316:40.85]They were eating it and stuff.
[316:42.93]They were peeling it and pulling it off of statues and biting into the creaminess.
[316:49.53]It made me love.
[316:50.45]I want marshmallows.
[316:51.67]I want it right now.
[316:52.49]In fact, I hope there's some marshmallow-related thing in the fridge because I'm going to eat it right now.
[316:59.47]Why does it have to be so sexual?
[317:01.47]It's marshmallow.
[317:03.53]It's marshmallow fluff cream.
[317:08.01]Yeah, relax.
[317:09.99]Get out of here.
[317:11.40]Get out of here.
[317:14.76]I love marshmallows, and that's where it came from.
[317:16.44]State Park Marshmallow Man died, and I liked it.
[317:19.64]Yes, there you go.
[317:20.56]TL;DR.
[317:22.60]And then finally, we had Freak Out for $5. $5.
[317:27.35]Thanks for the five bucks.
[317:28.03]Did you hear about Rick May?
[317:29.52]He's the voice of the TF2 soldier, and he died last week from the virus.
[317:33.44]It took a heart attack, cancer, and a global pandemic to kill that man.
[317:37.30]He did good, son.
[317:38.00]Real good.
[317:38.45]Maybe even the best.
[317:41.13]Yeah, that's horrible.
[317:45.69]I don't know what else...
[317:49.16]Rick May may have done, but these characters, like the soldier, it'll stay, that, just how fun and funny and interesting the soldier was, it'll stay with me forever.
[318:03.71]I think a lot of you too.
[318:05.97]Just the timing and the delivery that a lot of those guys had was just, they were having so much fun.
[318:13.20]And you could tell, you could tell that when TF2 was first released and they started doing the meet the team videos, those guys were having a fucking blast.
[318:22.76]The devs were having a blast.
[318:24.35]The players are having a blast.
[318:25.79]The actors were having a ton of fun.
[318:27.39]It was so much fun shit.
[318:29.61]Everybody was having such a great time.
[318:31.03]It'll stay with me forever.
[318:31.85]Like some of those lines will stay with me forever.
[318:36.89]So somebody like Rick May has absolutely, will stay in my memories and in my thoughts forever.
[318:54.02]So I'm really, really sad to hear that.
[319:02.25]But with that, we are going to be done.
[319:04.67]I will see you guys tomorrow for community content night.
[319:07.34]We're going to do some art videos and we're going to hang out.
[319:11.84]Maybe you'll be there.
[319:12.44]If not, maybe we'll see you again the next day for public domain movie night.
[319:18.77]Take care.
[319:20.17]We'll see you soon.
[319:21.97]Goodbye.
[319:29.98]Thank you for watching.
[320:03.90]you
