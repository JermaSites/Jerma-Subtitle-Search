[ve:61.1.100]

[00:01.11]Hey, we're back.
[00:02.67]And it's time to unbox some CS:GO crates.
[00:05.26]That's what I'm talking about.
[00:06.20]We have 100 CS:GO crates that we're going to open.
[00:08.80]Wow.
[00:09.10]And I'm excited.
[00:10.08]Mala is a pro CS:GO player.
[00:11.88]Pretty amazing here.
[00:12.96]She's going to enjoy this.
[00:15.40]We pitch a few things before we start.
[00:17.27]We have six knives already unboxed.
[00:19.91]Six knives?
[00:20.87]Yes.
[00:21.33]It's a timed raffle.
[00:22.53]Yeah, we have a timed raffle for the six knives.
[00:24.17]So it's $5, just like all the other timed raffles during this segment.
[00:28.84]I don't know how long it's going to take to unbox 100.
[00:30.88]Probably 40 minutes, maybe.
[00:33.24]Hopefully.
[00:33.58]A little less than that.
[00:34.42]A little celebration when we unbox the best knife in the world.
[00:36.91]Oh, of course.
[00:37.43]That's going to add 20 minutes on there.
[00:39.05]Marshmallows.
[00:39.33]For sure.
[00:40.97]Yeah, we got some marshmallows.
[00:42.82]So yeah, that's what you guys want to get on that.
[00:44.98]It's automatic.
[00:45.88]And then everything that we unbox is also a raffle incentive.
[00:48.64]It's only $1 to enter the CS:GO stuff.
[00:50.95]$1?
[00:51.39]Yeah.
[00:51.47]If you donate five bucks, you get five entries, and you get an entry into the time raffle.
[00:56.07]That's only for CS:GO, though, because we're going to do 400 TF2 crates.
[01:00.62]Starster and Jerma are going to be a part of that, too, commenting on the crap that Truck Truck unboxes.
[01:09.04]The more you donate towards the raffle, the better chance you have.
[01:11.70]Yes.
[01:12.64]And if you specify $1 for whatever we unbox in the CS:GO raffle, the winner gets that.
[01:18.01]And then every $5, you get a chance to win one of the knives, right?
[01:21.98]We're not giving away all six at once.
[01:23.34]Six winners, six knives.
[01:24.51]So there's six separate winners.
[01:25.39]So you have actually a way better chance.
[01:27.01]Good chance.
[01:27.61]And everyone loves knives.
[01:29.00]So we're going to get right into it.
[01:30.78]I don't want to wait anymore.
[01:31.92]We also have the auctions up if you want to join the Tip of the Hats theme group.
[01:35.27]That should be posted in the stream chat.
[01:37.34]Click on the discussion forums and you can look at all of the threads that are up are an individual item.
[01:42.61]There's some really cool stuff.
[01:43.81]A lot of bids already, though, so hopefully you've got some cash.
[01:46.96]But some really good stuff.
[01:47.74]Signed Jerma, signed Ster items, and we're off here.
[01:50.44]Yeah.
[01:51.56]We apologize.
[01:52.18]We're not going to be unboxing any of the new ones.
[01:54.13]We weren't able to get a hold of any of them.
[01:56.71]I think they're still like five bucks.
[01:58.55]There's like this new knife in this game.
[02:00.19]It's like two little knives.
[02:01.47]Really?
[02:01.72]You go like this.
[02:03.00]It looks so weird.
[02:03.82]I mean, some people might like it, but I think it looks a little tacky.
[02:07.52]I got a CZ.
[02:08.84]That's a pretty good unbox.
[02:10.75]We want the knives, though.
[02:12.31]It's all or nothing, in my opinion.
[02:13.89]But the pretty skins are good, too.
[02:15.27]Yes, I agree.
[02:16.49]And you can also, if you win all of them, you can put them in trade-up contracts.
[02:20.45]Even if we don't get a knife, you're going to get at least $100 worth of stuff.
[02:23.74]I think we got an op here.
[02:24.92]Ooh, that's nice.
[02:25.54]This is pretty good so far.
[02:28.12]We should just quit right now.
[02:29.62]We are actually ahead.
[02:31.16]Yeah, just stop.
[02:33.28]Nice.
[02:33.85]Alright.
[02:34.25]No more.
[02:34.65]We're good.
[02:35.03]That's it.
[02:36.33]Alright.
[02:39.39]So who exactly is doing the unboxing right now back there?
[02:41.77]Eren.
[02:42.22]Eren's doing it.
[02:43.12]She was doing the overnight, and she did a great job doing the overnight, I'm sure.
[02:46.64]Maybe we could, if she, you know, 10 in or 25 in, if she's not, there's no results, we can switch it out.
[02:51.87]Maybe you can go back there.
[02:52.71]You are the, you're due.
[02:54.99]You're good luck.
[02:56.19]No, I'm not.
[02:56.88]Ooh, what did we get here?
[02:57.68]This is like gold.
[02:58.54]The deagle.
[02:59.10]It's almost as good as the well-worn mutter.
[03:01.96]My pride and joy.
[03:03.81]Alright.
[03:04.46]But, yeah, what was I going to say?
[03:07.84]Oh, yeah, last year, Mela, Lang, and I unboxed 200 TF2 crates.
[03:12.41]We got nothing.
[03:13.41]Nothing at all.
[03:14.03]So I'm not good luck, at least when it comes to, like, clicking on stuff.
[03:17.53]Sawed-off origami.
[03:19.03]Beautiful.
[03:19.40]In the tiers of the colors, these are the bottom tier, that, like, blue.
[03:22.90]But they're still pretty.
[03:23.92]Purple are better.
[03:25.14]If you look at the scale there.
[03:26.66]Yeah.
[03:27.12]We're going for a knife or that silenced M4 thing.
[03:31.17]Looks pretty awesome.
[03:31.87]That Tech 9 is pretty great, too.
[03:33.79]Oh, looks like an AK.
[03:35.31]But in the CS:GO world, all these skins you can gamble.
[03:39.80]There's all sorts of craziness you can do with skins in the game.
[03:42.14]That one's nice, though.
[03:43.20]If you're into gambling, CS:GO is a fantastic game.
[03:46.41]Even if you don't like playing the game, it is a fantastic game to watch.
[03:50.68]Still an AK, though.
[03:54.70]I've never seen live.
[03:55.90]I've watched my fair share of CS:GO streams, crate openings.
[03:59.08]I've never seen a knife unboxed live.
[04:00.77]Really?
[04:02.21]Maybe today's your day.
[04:03.27]We're going to be unboxing 100 here and then 400 TF2 cases and crates.
[04:08.02]We better get something rare.
[04:09.98]It's for the kids.
[04:10.58]We better get something.
[04:11.83]Come on, Ralph.
[04:12.77]All the way through this unboxing, if you want to join that time raffle,
[04:18.54]I'm losing my words here.
[04:20.62]It's $5, and you can put those five towards winning all these items.
[04:25.81]For the time raffle, we have six knives.
[04:27.74]We're raffling each six.
[04:29.90]You can win one, you can win two, you can win six.
[04:33.27]Got another saw.
[04:34.81]If you only have $1, you can get it on this raffle.
[04:38.44]You could win something just with $1.
[04:40.06]Yes.
[04:40.44]Sweet.
[04:41.00]You win everything that we unbox.
[04:43.27]You can unbox a $1,000 knife and you could win if you just throw a dollar at the sword.
[04:48.35]MP7 armor core.
[04:49.90]How would you rate this right now so far?
[04:51.36]It's eight items in.
[04:52.94]Average.
[04:53.74]Average, yeah.
[04:54.28]Average.
[04:54.66]Not bad.
[04:54.92]Not terrible.
[04:55.62]Yeah, could be worse.
[04:56.49]Floor tires in the room.
[04:57.99]Will that help?
[04:59.39]Here's good luck.
[05:00.09]Stay right there.
[05:00.95]Don't move.
[05:02.15]Don't move.
[05:04.06]AK Elite build another one.
[05:05.12]That's okay.
[05:07.71]But yeah, after this event, I'm going to be hosting this, hopefully with Lang.
[05:11.58]Who's not here because he's sleeping.
[05:13.17]The surf segment.
[05:14.09]Lang took a crap in the bathroom and then said he had to go nap.
[05:16.71]He went home to take a nap.
[05:17.98]Hopefully it wasn't a sleep.
[05:19.80]Just a little nip nap.
[05:21.75]Paddy whack.
[05:22.75]Yes.
[05:24.15]Alright.
[05:25.13]I'm looking for something here.
[05:26.55]I want something.
[05:27.19]Well, what you're looking for is probably the M4S Hyper Beast, but the M4S got nerfed recently, so it's worth, like, nothing now.
[05:39.06]Oh, really?
[05:39.84]Yeah.
[05:40.28]All that regular M4s.
[05:42.17]It might get fixed, though.
[05:44.47]Who knows?
[05:45.31]Yeah.
[05:45.79]In the future.
[05:46.29]It could be a knee-jerk reaction, too.
[05:47.83]It, like, happened right away.
[05:50.51]Yeah.
[05:51.06]Yeah.
[05:53.41]RELAXING UNBOXING.
[05:54.88]THEY WOULD LIKE ME TO MENTION FOR THE AUCTIONS THAT I BROUGHT UP EARLIER, YOU WANT THE SIGNED Ster Jerma ITEMS OR THE NUMBER ONE.
[06:00.67]WE HAVE TWO NUMBER ONE HATS.
[06:02.34]THE MAXIMUM BID INCREMENT IS $100.
[06:05.12]I mean, I feel like if you want to go, I mean, within reason, you know, if you want $800 for that thing.
[06:09.67]It's to keep people from trolling.
[06:11.77]Going in there and just throwing down a huge number and just not showing up again.
[06:14.64]That's true.
[06:15.08]Because we will take the next highest bid if that winner doesn't pay.
[06:19.11]So there's a chance, even if you don't win, if the person that did win doesn't pay, that you could still get the item.
[06:24.46]And all that info is in the chat, I'm sure, being spammed of how to bid if you so choose to do that.
[06:31.55]Oh!
[06:32.83]Oh!
[06:34.61]That's pretty good.
[06:35.01]That's pretty good.
[06:35.65]Except it's the science version.
[06:37.13]What wear is that?
[06:38.26]But Hyper-V's nice.
[06:39.06]It's hard to tell what it is.
[06:40.54]Can you check the quality of it?
[06:41.54]Is it factory?
[06:42.20]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[06:42.84]What's the quality?
[06:43.56]Let's check that one out.
[06:44.40]We've got to field test it.
[06:45.68]That's pretty good, though.
[06:46.41]That's worth quite a bit.
[06:48.09]Good stuff so far.
[06:48.81]They know it works.
[06:49.39]It used to be.
[06:49.99]Maybe it still is.
[06:51.13]Who knows?
[06:51.51]Give it some time.
[06:52.09]Give it some time.
[06:52.83]It's still very pretty.
[06:54.27]I agree.
[06:54.80]If you want to win that, then...
[06:56.56]Just put a donation of at least a dollar and put that as your incentive.
[06:59.93]That plus all these blue items.
[07:02.20]You can have yourself a... Nah, that's terrible.
[07:06.33]Can't even say anything about that.
[07:08.82]Yeah, next.
[07:10.85]I just want to point out, too, that we're almost to $170,000.
[07:12.51]That is crazy.
[07:14.55]We are in the money.
[07:15.26]Every little bit helps, even if you don't want to enter any of the raffles.
[07:18.34]Even the dollar.
[07:19.00]You should be able to find something that you'd want to enter in, but you can throw some money towards the charity.
[07:23.44]It's a fantastic organization.
[07:25.05]It is, and so much great stuff up, too, if that's an incentive.
[07:28.47]We're actually only $20 away from it, so by the end of this sentence, we're probably going to be done.
[07:33.86]That's my boy.
[07:34.88]Best gun in the game.
[07:37.44]There's a reason it's the most expensive.
[07:40.16]Because it's the best gun.
[07:44.99]Your bad luck, Whisker.
[07:48.21]Yeah, get out of here, Whisker.
[07:49.43]Get out of the room.
[07:50.61]Either on the couch or out of here.
[07:52.99]Alright, I think that last donation indeed puts us over, or will eventually put us over $170,000, so yay.
[08:01.58]Yeah, after 50 Chroma II cases, we're going to be doing 50 Falcon.
[08:06.52]Oh, yeah, $170,000.
[08:07.23]$170,000, yay!
[08:09.25]$170,000, woo!
[08:10.37]Gamers on the corner don't care.
[08:14.39]So shooting for 200,000.
[08:15.56]I think that's well in reach.
[08:17.36]We've gotten one really good item, right?
[08:23.31]Yeah, one good.
[08:24.49]And then some decent stuff.
[08:26.59]Oh, this one's nice.
[08:27.95]B250.
[08:28.35]I want a knife.
[08:30.48]Yes.
[08:30.92]It's all I want.
[08:31.54]Valence.
[08:32.80]Justin will take it and run with it.
[08:34.76]What kind of knife would you want?
[08:35.94]Do you even know what kind it is?
[08:36.94]I want a butterfly knife.
[08:37.89]Butterfly knife?
[08:38.71]I like just the regular butterfly knife.
[08:41.65]I want the one you were talking about, the double.
[08:44.24]You can't get that in this crate.
[08:46.48]Those crates came out two days ago.
[08:48.57]Oh, wow.
[08:49.11]And they're like $5 each.
[08:50.81]So we could not afford to do that right last second, unfortunately.
[08:56.76]But anyway, I'm not a huge fan of how those look.
[09:00.42]You can look them up.
[09:01.60]Is that a cool animation when you kill a guy at least?
[09:03.95]I don't know, but he just goes like this.
[09:07.69]When you attack, you go like this.
[09:09.15]The butterfly knife's cool.
[09:10.21]You go like this.
[09:11.64]It's like you're driving a miniature car.
[09:16.82]I'd rather have a nice Huntsman or a Bayonet M9.
[09:23.02]Or like you said, a butterfly.
[09:24.92]But you can't get a butterfly out of this either.
[09:26.97]So we're all just going to be disappointed.
[09:30.62]Oh, so close.
[09:31.72]That's okay.
[09:32.28]Next time, next time.
[09:35.15]We're almost... Are we over halfway there?
[09:36.69]No.
[09:37.25]Yeah, because that's... We're only to, like, 25.
[09:40.72]Okay, yeah, it's 20.
[09:41.74]We're about a quarter of the way there.
[09:42.96]Yeah, a quarter of the way.
[09:43.52]We're making good time.
[09:44.48]We just want to make sure we don't go over time.
[09:47.23]Alright, well, we're looking for a big one here.
[09:49.03]Get some hype going.
[09:49.93]But, yeah, if you just entered the stream, if you throw down a dollar, you can get in on winning all of the stuff that we unbox.
[09:57.04]It doesn't matter how little value or how expensive...
[10:00.31]OF THE STUFF WE UNBOX.
[10:01.33]IF YOU DONATE A DOLLAR, YOU CAN GET IN ON THE CS:GO RAFFLE.
[10:04.28]JUST GO TO TIPOFTHEHATS.ORG.
[10:06.56]IF YOU DONATE $5 OR MORE, WE ARE GIVING AWAY SIX KNIVES.
[10:12.65]SIX KNIVES, YEAH.
[10:15.06]Make sure you specify that the knives is only during this unboxing.
[10:20.79]Yeah, it's only during this unboxing.
[10:24.67]That's great.
[10:25.29]Check it, check it.
[10:26.01]Yeah, what's the quality?
[10:26.93]It's a gin.
[10:27.88]Field tested.
[10:28.42]Field tested, alright.
[10:29.38]I mean, we're just saving the good quality for the rarest of the rare.
[10:32.78]Yeah, but if you donate the $5, you're automatically entered to win one of the six knives.
[10:36.71]And you are also entered to win all of the stuff that we invite.
[10:40.29]You have to specify if you want to win the items.
[10:42.80]It's on the tracker.
[10:44.00]But it's easy.
[10:44.68]Just go to the website.
[10:45.62]It is easy.
[10:46.90]And it's for a good cause.
[10:48.14]For the kids.
[10:48.96]For the kids.
[10:51.06]TF2 does look different right now.
[10:53.19]TF2 looks, yeah, a little strange.
[10:54.73]A little bit different.
[10:55.51]A little bit like CS:GO.
[10:57.13]We're going to see some CS:GO as we're actually surfing.
[10:59.61]Yeah, we are going to be surfing in CS:GO.
[11:01.80]Are we surfing in TF2 as well?
[11:03.46]No, we are not.
[11:04.24]Oh, okay.
[11:04.82]Just CS:GO surfing.
[11:05.92]Okay, cool.
[11:06.44]We have surfers from every surf community, TF2, CS:GO, and Source.
[11:13.27]You yourself, you're going to lace them up and get out there.
[11:15.57]Yeah, if we hit a donation incentive, that's for another hour from now.
[11:21.92]Well, Lang and I are going to co-op surf.
[11:23.42]I'm going to have the mouse, and he's going to have the keyboard.
[11:25.32]We're going to get real close.
[11:27.97]That's going to be adorable.
[11:29.01]We're going to be sweating on each other by the time that's over.
[11:31.63]Hey.
[11:35.43]Yes.
[11:36.47]It's perfect.
[11:37.50]That's not bad.
[11:39.20]Worm God.
[11:39.96]Yes.
[11:40.44]Trufflecopter is going to be there.
[11:42.24]He's probably the most popular streamer for surfing.
[11:45.22]Oh, that's cool.
[11:46.88]Field tested.
[11:47.60]Nice.
[11:48.19]He's going to be there for sure.
[11:49.81]100%.
[11:50.43]He's going to be doing Omnific too.
[11:52.31]For those of you guys that know that map, it is considered one of the hardest maps.
[11:56.43]And he has one of the most impressive runs on that map.
[12:03.02]Oh.
[12:03.16]Another P250.
[12:09.35]Okay.
[12:11.24]Next.
[12:12.30]The chat's just like going through every single surfer and just like caps locking them.
[12:17.01]Yes.
[12:17.41]Muffins is going to be there.
[12:18.55]And blue again.
[12:23.48]Alright.
[12:25.25]Another deagle.
[12:27.51]We do have a lot of donations coming in.
[12:28.87]Could read a couple of them.
[12:30.29]Yeah.
[12:30.43]Go for it.
[12:31.13]We're getting all perfect for donations.
[12:32.74]Yeah, it's perfect for donations.
[12:34.04]I don't want to read one as we roll over the knife and I miss it, but whatever.
[12:36.86]We'll take that chance.
[12:37.80]I'll watch it for you.
[12:38.72]We'll interrupt you.
[12:39.64]We'll scream if one's on the star or whatever.

[12:51.36]Hoping that we'll be blessed with something.
[12:53.60]That is a hot meme.
[12:54.54]It's been hot ever since it's born.
[12:56.59]Maybe he'll come to the next tip of the hats.
[12:58.49]I think that's a good goal.
[13:00.21]Ask Gavin for the knife.
[13:02.33]He doesn't care.
[13:03.94]He doesn't even know.
[13:05.04]But you can ask him.
[13:07.66]Shut up.

[13:26.53]We got a lot of P250s.

[13:36.21]I mean, I would like one.
[13:37.89]Yeah, well, who wouldn't?
[13:39.41]I like that skin.
[13:41.46]That's a hot skin.
[13:42.94]The kids out there.
[13:43.76]It's a real hot skin.
[13:45.08]They call that the Swag 7.
[13:46.02]Literally, it's hot.
[13:46.90]That's the Swag 7.
[13:47.92]It's well-worn.
[13:50.06]That's what I'm talking about.
[13:51.47]Well-worn Swag 7.
[13:53.09]It's so hot, it's well-worn.
[13:54.95]It's got a lot of kills on it.
[13:56.27]A lot of heat damage there.

[14:19.79]Yeah, that looks like $1,000.
[14:21.19]I think that's pretty big.
[14:22.30]Let's see if we got a message on it.
[14:23.54]Someone wants some knives, I think.
[14:24.66]Yeah.
[14:25.50]Just say, hey.
[14:26.64]We had a $120 donation as this thing refreshes.

[15:15.43]That's the motivation.
[15:16.19]I think that's right.
[15:16.71]You want to win, but for the kids, bottom line.
[15:19.60]Gun hats, yes.
[15:23.24]I mean, there's a banana hat in TF2, so there's probably going to be a gun hat eventually.
[15:27.57]Yeah.
[15:30.61]That's a hot meme, too.
[15:33.12]$25 donation from FaZe96.
[15:35.80]Keep up the great work, Jimothy and crew.
[15:38.26]That is in Rio.
[15:39.36]I believe FaZe is a good friend of Rio's who couldn't make it out here.
[15:43.73]Shout out to FaZe and in Rio.
[15:47.02]Yes, thank you very much.
[15:47.74]Thank you.
[15:48.22]Thanks to all our donations.
[15:51.35]We're probably getting close to halfway through this thing.
[15:54.07]Seems like you really want this to be over with.
[15:59.14]It's a banana.
[16:00.28]It's a banana.
[16:01.48]Monkey business.
[16:02.89]It's a banana.
[16:03.89]Someone made that and he is getting paid for it.
[16:06.85]Field tested.
[16:07.35]That's okay, though.
[16:08.70]It's the banana gun.
[16:09.84]How much is that one worth, Justin?
[16:12.98]Probably a fair amount.
[16:14.24]I like that.
[16:15.55]Yeah.
[16:16.03]You could win that if you just donate.
[16:17.97]No, I brought up the time because I want to make sure if you're interested, because I'm sure we've got some people that are joining because they see us on the CS:GO.
[16:23.22]Yes, yes.
[16:23.78]We've been seeing you all day.
[16:24.66]Mention the raffles again, for sure.
[16:26.22]Yeah, if you're just clicking in.
[16:27.95]All the stuff that we're opening, you can win for just a $1 bid.
[16:31.07]You'll be entered in the raffle, but you have to specify as you bid that you want your money to go to that.
[16:35.86]You can have it go to all sorts of cool stuff.
[16:37.42]You can win this quilt.
[16:39.86]It's an amazing quilt.
[16:41.08]Speaking of in Rio, his mother made this beautiful quilt.
[16:42.94]This is the coolest thing ever in Tip of the Hats.
[16:45.43]I agree.
[16:46.79]If I was allowed to win anything, I would put it in there.
[16:50.62]It would be rigged.
[16:51.78]But yeah, you just put a dollar or more, and you select this raffle.
[16:58.18]And at the end of the date, we will raffle off the winner of all 100 of these crates that we're opening up.
[17:03.13]We've got some pretty good stuff.
[17:04.41]Nothing groundbreaking.
[17:05.87]Just an update.
[17:07.13]The timed raffle for the knife giveaway, it is during the surf event as well.
[17:12.44]Oh, okay.
[17:13.04]So if you need to steal your mom's credit card, you got an extra hour.
[17:16.18]What?
[17:17.03]You got an extra hour to get upstairs, get in her purse, get back downstairs.
[17:21.85]It's for the kids.
[17:22.23]It's for the kids, Colin.
[17:24.19]Yeah.
[17:26.14]You did your little hand thing too.
[17:27.48]Steal your mom's credit card.
[17:28.28]I don't know why.
[17:28.94]Just steal your mom's credit card.
[17:30.68]We all have done it before.
[17:32.44]for CS:GO Unboxing.
[17:34.37]Neutral.
[17:34.93]I like that one.

[17:58.51]This is good.
[17:59.17]Minimal wear.
[17:59.97]Yeah, nice, nice.
[18:01.11]That thing's worth four bucks.
[18:02.51]Four whole dollars.
[18:03.61]You know?
[18:03.93]No.
[18:04.44]You look it up?
[18:05.08]No.
[18:05.54]We have people on computers that can tell us.
[18:07.74]We just have people looking at us right now.
[18:09.74]Like thousands of people looking at us.
[18:12.29]It's like two in a row.
[18:14.05]We're getting there.
[18:14.63]Wow.
[18:16.51]Ooh, I like that one.
[18:17.75]I like that.

[18:19.88]That's a snazzy one.
[18:20.46]That is nice.
[18:21.46]I would donate a dollar for that.
[18:22.86]Yeah, I would donate a dollar for all this.
[18:24.28]I would donate more than a dollar.
[18:25.34]All this stuff is worth way more than a dollar.

[22:14.33]Just a dollar.
[22:15.19]Or five dollars for five entries and an entry into the timed raffle, which is six knives.
[22:22.62]Yeah, the time raffle ends after the surfing segment.
[22:24.97]So we're staying in CS:GO for a little bit longer surfing, which is going to be incredible.
[22:28.61]I'm not sure how surfing in CS:GO compares.
[22:33.59]It's very similar.
[22:34.13]Hey, get over there.
[22:34.55]Oh, my.
[22:35.29]That's a great one.
[22:36.22]That is a beat up awkwardly.
[22:40.98]What's the quality there?
[22:42.28]The dolphins are in some trouble.
[22:47.37]The dolphins are injured.
[22:48.63]Can we see that one again when you have a chance?
[22:51.41]Can you inspect that?
[22:52.39]Just right click it and inspect it.
[22:55.74]Someone rolled over that thing in a lawn mower or something.
[23:00.52]That's alright.
[23:01.46]It looks okay.
[23:02.51]$16.
[23:03.09]Nice.
[23:05.13]So if you donate just a dollar, you could win that and all this stuff.

[24:04.55]I don't know how Kurt looks so good in that horribly colored shirt.
[24:08.44]I think this is a woman's shirt, but somehow he does.
[24:11.12]It's definitely a woman's shirt.
[24:12.22]Yeah, I just found it in a box in the back.
[24:14.39]But it's a one-step camp shirt, so I decided it would be a good idea to wear it.
[24:18.05]And it says camp on the back.
[24:19.41]How could you not wear it?
[24:20.27]Come on.
[24:21.08]You don't fill it out like Justin does, but...
[24:23.53]I'm not jacked.
[24:24.79]I'm just a gamer.
[24:26.32]Eating some gamer grub and opening some cases.
[24:28.92]Oh, oh, oh, pink.
[24:30.16]It's MP7, so, you know.
[24:31.50]MP7?
[24:31.78]That's okay.
[24:32.32]But that's still good.
[24:33.31]Sometimes you need to buy the MP7.
[24:34.51]It's not okay.
[24:35.25]We need another.
[24:35.93]Nemesis.
[24:36.59]Nice, nice.
[24:37.37]That looks pretty awesome.

[24:51.50]Alright, alright.
[24:52.20]That's a good point by Mela.
[24:53.48]He's correct.
[24:54.09]It's an MP7.
[24:54.51]But still, that's cool.
[24:55.47]Factory new.
[24:57.86]You can bet on that.
[25:02.82]Mr. Jelly169 with a $20 donation.
[25:05.38]Of course, the spy main wants a knife.
[25:07.03]Shake my head.
[25:07.67]Not even a spy main.
[25:11.03]It's smhmyheadcurtisthegamer.
[25:13.26]Yeah, he's shaking his head.
[25:14.42]Shake my head.
[25:15.46]My head.
[25:16.66]That's the joke.
[25:18.45]I don't get the joke.
[25:19.17]Oh, pink.
[25:19.73]It's a stat track, too.
[25:21.09]That's great.
[25:21.95]Wow.
[25:22.79]That looks... Cyrex, another Cyrex.
[25:24.86]Yeah, it looks, you know...
[25:26.02]And what's the quality?
[25:27.56]It looks a little rough there.
[25:28.85]Well worn.
[25:29.33]That's okay.
[25:32.11]That's okay.
[25:33.16]Well worn.
[25:35.00]Hey, you know, getting there.
[25:37.67]Justin's not impressed over there.
[25:38.71]He's like, whatever.
[25:39.81]I'm popping over here.
[25:44.65]Alright.
[25:45.93]What the hell is that?
[25:47.26]It's in the give.
[25:48.06]It's a bumblebee in the give.
[25:49.20]Definitely in the give.
[25:49.94]Loudmouth.
[25:50.70]Beautiful.
[25:51.18]Actually, that one is really cool.
[25:52.53]Is that like animates?
[25:53.77]Yeah, it animates the teeth.
[25:55.17]I like it.
[25:55.51]That one's pretty cool.
[25:56.47]It looks a little rough.
[25:58.88]Field tested.
[25:59.44]That's okay.
[26:01.48]You know, it's alright.
[26:05.98]You can get two of those for under a dollar.
[26:14.13]Or you can enter this raffle and potentially get everything that we unbox.
[26:18.14]60 bucks?
[26:21.88]That's alright.
[26:22.90]That's not bad.
[26:25.79]$250 for the keys.
[26:26.87]$70?
[26:29.81]Oh, really?
[26:30.35]Nice.
[26:31.31]I'm sorry to interrupt here.
[26:33.13]Somebody needed some of my superpowers.
[26:35.48]Yes, we need your luck.
[26:36.86]We need your superpowers.
[26:38.42]We need to sync this up.
[26:39.68]Please, Jerma.
[26:40.83]Please.
[26:41.71]Okay, so I don't know.
[26:43.09]I went for a jog this morning, so my superpower meter might be a little bit low, but I'll give it a go.
[26:48.04]We're looking for a loot, right?
[26:49.84]For a knife.
[26:50.66]We're looking for some loot.
[26:52.60]Well, does it have to be a knife, or can it be a blue?
[26:55.05]It could be a rare... I'd like a knife.
[26:57.77]Yeah.
[26:58.75]No, that's the least rare, Jerma.
[27:01.40]Well, I told you.
[27:02.00]I told you.
[27:02.32]I went for a jar.
[27:02.92]Let me try.
[27:03.66]Let me drink my loot juice.
[27:05.36]Right here.
[27:06.05]Let me just get... Oh.
[27:10.73]Whoa, boy.
[27:11.31]Okay, I got to go now.
[27:12.60]Are you ready?
[27:13.82]We're so ready.
[27:14.46]Let's do it.
[27:14.96]Let's do it.
[27:17.55]Oh, my God.
[27:17.81]Let's see.
[27:18.11]Let's see.
[27:20.59]Alright.
[27:22.37]It doesn't look like Jerma's going to be on the stream for the remainder of the house.
[27:28.18]It was really nice having him.
[27:29.84]It was nice having you here.
[27:30.84]So, yeah.
[27:32.78]Factory new.
[27:33.20]It was factory new.
[27:33.96]Did you drink more lute juice?
[27:35.81]That's 70 cents.
[27:36.71]I think you need more.
[27:37.53]70 cents over here.
[27:38.49]More lute juice.
[27:39.11]Come on.
[27:39.31]70 cents for the can of Coke you just drank on stream.
[27:42.48]Yeah.
[27:43.01]Jeremy, can we try again?
[27:44.77]He's gone.
[27:46.30]He peaced out.
[27:47.70]How about Ster?
[27:48.74]Ster, yeah.
[27:49.74]Ster's good luck.
[27:50.56]Can we get him in here?
[27:51.12]He's good at burning money and deleting stuff that's valuable on stream.
[27:56.90]I don't know.
[27:57.60]If we get a knife, Star's probably going to somehow delete it.
[27:59.91]I don't even think you can delete knives in this game.
[28:05.31]Maybe you can.
[28:06.29]Who knows?
[28:06.95]Probably can.
[28:07.87]Yeah, I think you can delete it.
[28:09.35]Maybe we'll have to test it if we get a knife.
[28:11.56]Definitely.
[28:12.42]Definitely.
[28:13.42]We're not going to get a knife, though.
[28:15.10]Well, we're three quarters, almost three quarters of the way through.
[28:18.31]So we still have a chance.
[28:20.33]It wasn't Coke.
[28:21.18]It was Dock to Peppa.
[28:24.56]Oh, pink.
[28:24.92]Oh, not pink.
[28:27.73]Just as good.
[28:29.99]Stat track.
[28:30.73]Stat track, yeah.
[28:32.90]If you guys are just joining us, you can donate just $1 and specify that you're donating for the CS:GO unboxing, and you can win all of this stuff that we're unboxing.
[28:42.26]And if you donate $5 and specify that it's for the knives... No, you don't have to specify for the five.
[28:46.55]Oh, okay, okay.
[28:47.81]If you donate $5 within this event, this unboxing and the surfing, you get a chance to win one of six knives we're raffling off.
[28:55.68]And, yeah, that would be five entries to this as well.
[28:59.44]Nice.
[28:59.96]Secret and bold.
[29:00.86]Yeah.
[29:01.22]Or you could just donate, like, $1,000 and have 1,000 entries.
[29:04.22]Like that guy did.
[29:04.92]Yeah.
[29:07.51]Yeah.
[29:07.97]Dr. Pepper.
[29:09.35]Dr. Pepper.
[29:09.85]Even if you donate $1 right now, I think you're, like, getting roughly 75 times the amount.
[29:14.09]You have good equity on your dollar.
[29:17.66]Throw down that dollar for the kids.
[29:19.60]For the kids.
[29:20.02]$20 donation from Two's Compliment.
[29:24.25]May the based Gaben be with you.
[29:26.59]Please, Gaben.
[29:28.15]You got to go over that knife.
[29:30.23]That's what all the streamers do.
[29:31.46]It's for the kids.
[29:32.22]I'm a streamer.
[29:33.08]For the kids.
[29:34.38]You put your mouse over the knife, and you're like, Lord Gaben, give me a knife.
[29:42.37]We're running out.
[29:43.23]Oh, we're almost done.
[29:44.20]Are these different crates now?
[29:45.42]What?
[29:46.33]These are different crates.
[29:49.04]Come on.
[29:49.80]Come on.
[29:50.73]Go.
[29:51.27]Pink.
[29:52.25]Come on.
[29:53.51]You got an arsenal of Cyrex SGs.
[29:55.88]This is the third Cyrex.
[29:57.52]Yes.
[29:59.11]But you could win three Cyrexes.
[30:00.91]It's field testing.
[30:01.45]Among other things.
[30:02.43]FIELD TESTED, YEAH.
[30:04.10]AND IF YOU GUYS ARE JUST JOINING US, WE ARE RAISING MONEY.
[30:06.60]THIS IS TIP OF THE HATS.
[30:07.42]WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR ONE-STEP CAMP FOR KIDS WITH CANCER TO GO TO CAMP AND HAVE A GREAT TIME.
[30:14.68]IF WE REACH 200K, THAT IS 200 CAMPERS.
[30:16.79]200 KIDS CAN GO TO CAMP.
[30:18.09]THAT'S BASICALLY AN ENTIRE CAMP.
[30:19.77]YEAH.
[30:20.33]YEAH.
[30:21.03]HOW MUCH IS THAT FIELD TESTED THING?
[30:22.55]THAT'S $3.07.
[30:23.91]BACK TO YOU.
[30:24.59]THANK YOU.
[30:25.64]WOW, $3.
[30:26.56]THANK YOU, LAYLA.
[30:29.46]DON'T TAKE OFFENSE.
[30:30.16]THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
[30:31.91]Blaine's awesome.
[30:32.87]Look at all those USPs in a row.
[30:34.78]Come on, Gaben.
[30:35.48]That's the USP case.
[30:36.68]Which one do we want?
[30:37.58]Which USP do we want?
[30:38.90]That one looks nice, at least.
[30:39.88]Alright, I think we need to hover over the knife before unboxing.
[30:45.95]Unbox it and then put the cursor on the knife on the bottom right.
[30:49.93]That's going to work.
[30:50.77]Yeah, that adds to something.
[30:54.07]Do a couple swirls up to you.
[30:55.70]How many swirls do you want?
[30:57.20]I think five more.
[30:57.94]One, two, up.
[30:59.79]THAT'S ABOUT FIVE.
[31:01.50]THAT WAS REAL FAST.
[31:07.27]Wow, that did not help.
[31:09.25]No knives.
[31:10.19]Purple, though.
[31:10.79]That's actually pretty good.
[31:11.75]Yeah.
[31:12.41]That's PG.
[31:13.54]So maybe five more swirls?
[31:15.14]I like that.
[31:15.54]Yeah, five more swirls.
[31:16.40]I'd rock that.
[31:16.88]Okay.
[31:17.34]Oh, that's well-worn.
[31:19.38]Alright.
[31:19.82]I actually am.
[31:21.17]That's $1.47.
[31:22.31]Wow.
[31:23.73]I want to get another.
[31:25.07]Swirl, swirl, swirl.
[31:27.35]About five more, and then another five.
[31:30.24]Oh, yeah.
[31:31.28]Let's go the other way.
[31:32.14]One, two, three, four.
[31:33.12]Okay, that's it.
[31:33.72]Let's go.
[31:34.54]Alright.
[31:38.30]And purple.
[31:41.20]We're not doing too bad on the mid-range items.
[31:45.69]I don't know if that one's worth a dollar, though.
[31:47.35]How much is that one worth, Mila?
[31:50.94]Field tested.
[31:51.60]34 cents.
[31:55.12]Ooh!
[31:55.90]Wow!
[31:57.38]Wow!
[31:59.11]Almost three for a dollar.
[32:02.85]Almost.
[32:04.95]Man, she's going back and forth.
[32:06.73]Alright.
[32:07.45]Justin, go do one.
[32:08.50]Keep swirling.
[32:09.36]Alright.
[32:09.82]The last one we're going to have to swirl real hard.
[32:13.73]Oh, P90.
[32:15.64]So close.
[32:17.26]I have a $25 donation from Silvermoon88.
[32:19.87]Loving everything about the stream, and I'm glad I'm watching it.
[32:22.77]Saw it last year and loved every second of it.
[32:24.60]Awesome job, guys.
[32:25.74]Thank you.
[32:26.18]Thank you.
[32:26.96]Thank you.
[32:28.20]Alright.
[32:28.54]Swirl, swirl, swirl.
[32:30.02]Maybe you just need to, like, go across the knife.
[32:31.97]Like, if you're going around the knife, maybe you're dodging it.
[32:34.43]Yeah.
[32:35.15]Or maybe this doesn't do anything.
[32:42.70]It doesn't do anything.
[32:45.12]Another P90.
[32:46.00]I thought maybe that was the case.
[32:49.51]A dollar donation from LeDude91.
[32:51.89]Gabe N. Come on, man.
[32:53.21]It's for the kids.
[32:54.19]It's for the kids.
[32:55.23]Okay, we have three more guys.
[32:56.10]It's saving the best for last, you know?
[32:58.16]Three.
[32:58.88]Alright.
[32:59.32]Yep.
[33:01.14]Okay.
[33:01.34]Just touching it.
[33:02.10]Stroke that knife.
[33:03.09]Put it back on the knife.
[33:05.77]Wow, not even anything.
[33:07.11]Nope.
[33:07.59]Stat track.
[33:08.17]Stat track.
[33:08.75]Okay.

[33:30.69]MY HEART IS SINKING.
[33:31.93]THIS IS TERRIBLE.
[33:33.21]THE LAST ONE IS GOING TO BE IT, GUYS.
[33:34.69]I CAN FEEL IT.
[33:35.31]I CAN FEEL IT.
[33:40.14]YEAH, I THINK I NEED TO LEAVE THE BUILDING AFTER THIS ONE FOR THE TF2.
[33:43.69]OKAY, ALRIGHT, GUYS, WE GOT THIS.
[33:45.15]LAST ONE.
[33:47.34]AND GO.
[33:47.80]VIEW OUR BACKSCREEN.
[33:50.52]Please.
[33:51.72]Oh, my God.
[33:54.52]Alright.
[33:55.00]I'm disappointed.
[33:56.30]I thought we were going to get out of here.
[33:58.19]For the kids, Gavin.
[33:59.17]For the kids.
[33:59.81]That track.
[34:00.49]You still get value.
[34:02.09]Yeah.
[34:02.41]I mean, these are pretty good.
[34:03.45]We got some good stuff here.
[34:05.11]Let's go to the Aquamarine Revenge battle card.
[34:07.60]$1.62.
[34:08.14]Yeah.
[34:10.82]Bottom right there.
[34:12.18]Let's inspect that bad boy again.
[34:14.03]That thing's so bad.
[34:15.25]How much is this one worth?
[34:16.33]I like it.
[34:16.61]It's basically... It's like street art.
[34:20.65]Yeah, it's like a little graffiti gun.
[34:24.06]Someone threw some bleach on it.
[34:26.16]Let's clean it up.
[34:27.98]Try to clean the gun with some bleach.
[34:30.93]How much is that worth?
[34:32.15]That's 16.
[34:33.21]And the Hyper Beast Fuel Tested is 30.
[34:35.69]Alright.
[34:36.67]And they have a bunch of Cyrexes.
[34:37.95]What about all the Cyrexes?
[34:39.85]Three Cyrexes.
[34:41.08]That's alright.
[34:41.96]We got like 75-ish.
[34:42.82]Wow.
[34:43.04]That's it.
[34:43.90]So just $1 donation.
[34:45.44]You could win all of this.
[34:46.42]I think this is a lesson learned.
[34:48.90]Don't do this.
[34:50.28]If it's your own money, don't do this.
[34:53.27]Go to the market and purchase the item that you want.
[34:55.59]Have someone else do it for you.
[34:57.05]Or go to a stream and donate money for a chance to win all of it.
[34:59.97]How much is this one worth, Mayla?
[35:01.48]30.
[35:01.62]30.
[35:02.50]Okay.
[35:02.78]Alright.
[35:03.26]So this is our most valuable item here.
[35:04.71]I think it's pretty sweet.
[35:06.05]It's beautiful.
[35:06.89]I still use the M4A1.
[35:08.74]Yeah.
[35:09.52]I do too.
[35:10.22]Yeah.
[35:10.86]Got a little Cyrex action there.
[35:12.31]Yep.
[35:13.09]Yeah, the time raffle is going to go on through the surf segment.
[35:17.67]Yeah, six knives, six winners.
[35:19.25]Donate $5 or more.
[35:20.95]That's for the hats.
[35:22.65]Hats come later.
[35:24.12]You can wear a knife as a hat in this game.
[35:27.16]Yeah, so we have six knives.
[35:28.18]$5, you're automatically entered to win one of the six.
[35:32.48]And the more $5 increments that you donate, the better chance you have to win one or more of those knives.
[35:37.53]I don't know if you can win more than one.
[35:39.15]The guy who donated $1,000 has a really good chance of winning more than one.
[35:42.01]I don't know if he can.
[35:43.07]I think it's... I don't know how it works.
[35:44.99]It might be rigged if that guy went.
[35:46.24]To be honest.
[35:47.02]And Kurt, we've got a list of the knives here.
[35:49.64]We've got the kind of knives.
[35:50.60]We can tell you what we've got here.
[35:51.54]Maybe we should just not read them.
[35:52.82]No?
[35:53.18]They're all worth $10 or less.
[35:55.42]Really?
[35:55.92]No.
[35:56.28]But they're pretty.
[35:57.35]We've got... I don't think that's true.
[35:59.01]No, they're like mid-range knives, I'd say.
[36:01.43]Pretty decent knives.
[36:02.41]And a banana gun.
[36:03.23]We've got a scorched butterfly knife.
[36:05.09]A flip knife, blue steel.
[36:06.87]Nice.
[36:07.43]A flip knife, stained.
[36:09.08]A flip knife, stained.
[36:10.84]A Huntsman knife.
[36:12.87]Forest and another flip knife Safari match.
[36:16.04]Alright.
[36:16.48]I really am a fond of the flip knife.
[36:18.68]Yeah.
[36:19.24]Yeah, so They're all worth well over $5 and yeah, they're worth Roughly 65 bucks and if you play kind of straight go everybody wants a knife if you play it a lot Even if you play it just a little bit.
[36:33.28]I mean you look amazing when you have like Really cool
[36:37.02]So $5, enter a chance to win.
[36:41.25]What?
[36:42.05]That's what the chat's saying.
[36:44.22]Too late.
[36:44.52]You already donated.
[36:46.16]Hey.
[36:46.26]But guys, we hit $175,000.
[36:47.72]That's pretty good.
[36:51.13]And we still have plenty of time to get to that $200,000.
[36:53.35]I think it's going down.
[36:54.83]It's happening.
[36:55.74]Definitely happening.
[36:56.48]So up next, we have surfing.
[36:57.76]I think you're going to be a big part of that, playing and hosting and letting us know what's going on.
[37:02.47]Potentially playing.
[37:02.93]If we get Lang here to be your right hand.
[37:04.79]Hosting for sure.
[37:05.45]The people that are surfing are the best of the best.
[37:08.92]Okay.
[37:09.56]That's amazing.
[37:10.28]I'm excited for it.
[37:10.88]I think jumping was a lot of fun yesterday.
[37:13.16]Surfing, everyone's going to, I think if you've never seen it before or you're not that familiar, these guys are going to blow your mind.
[37:17.71]Yes.
[37:18.67]So that's ridiculous.
[37:19.71]What's coming up next?
[37:20.47]I don't know if we'll start it a little bit early since we are 10 minutes short of the hour change.
[37:23.40]Yeah, we can do more than an hour of surfing if we have time.
[37:28.31]Or we can get more pub time.
[37:29.69]We need to get everybody in the mumble.
[37:32.38]Yeah.
[37:32.76]Okay, so we're going to throw it to a quick break.
[37:35.18]We'll be back with more CS:GO in the surfing variety.
[37:38.73]Time for Apple will be continuing on through that hour.
[37:40.55]Donate $5.
[37:41.63]Get a chance to win one of those ewe knives.
[37:45.07]Yeah, ewe.
[37:46.23]They're knives, man.
[37:47.09]They're awesome.
[37:47.55]We are doing Surf the Distance.
[37:49.56]$5 donation.
[37:49.98]If you don't want them, we'll take them.
[37:51.42]Yeah, I'll take them.
[37:52.50]Just give it to me.
[37:54.64]Thanks, everybody.
[37:55.24]$175,000 and counting.
