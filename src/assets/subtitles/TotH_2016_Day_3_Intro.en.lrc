[ve:61.1.100]

[00:03.46]I had so much fun last year when I went, and I was sad to leave, so I waited a whole year to come back.
[00:14.12]I'm Caelid.
[00:15.16]When I was just about out of treatment, my nurse practitioner recommended camp to me.
[00:20.13]I just thought it was really fun that I could go somewhere where everybody would know what I've been through.
[00:24.56]When I'm talking to people who aren't involved with camp about camp, I could talk four or five hours about it.
[00:30.21]Outside in what I call the real world, they're kids with cancer, but here they get to be kids for two weeks.
[00:35.22]We were just playing paint twister and then it really escalated into a giant paint bite.
[00:41.47]Just put all the cares of the world away.
[00:43.43]You know, there's still the medical things in the background that we help take care of to make sure they're safe and still being treated if they need to be treated, but it's not up front.
[00:50.77]Up front you're a kid, you're having fun, you're doing things that other kids do at summer camps that these kids don't always get to do.
[00:56.68]My favorite thing to do is go swimming and play with my friends.
[01:00.15]Baking, fishing, arts and crafts.
[01:03.67]Archery, softballs.
[01:06.30]I've met so many great people here, just campers and counselors that I can relate to.
[01:12.08]We completely forget about our cancer and we just go along with it and we treat everybody the same.
[01:18.11]I am an attending physician at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, and I'm one of the medical directors of the Children's Oncology Services.
[01:25.55]We have nurses and physicians and advanced practice nurses out in the programs with the children so that all the medical needs can be taken care of.
[01:33.15]I take care of a lot of these kids in the clinic.
[01:35.27]And to be able to see them out here interacting with their peers, having a blast is the best.
[01:41.04]There's no need to sort of halt any treatment.
[01:43.64]Things can go on as normal.
[01:45.35]And the best part about it is that it's sort of seamless so that they don't feel like they're missing out on anything.
[01:50.25]Come even if you are nervous about it because everybody here really gets you.
[01:55.88]Everyone loves each other and would do anything for each other.
[01:59.66]It makes you comfortable then talking to just regular people that really probably doesn't really understand your situation.
[02:05.51]And you don't have to explain every little thing like about the treatments because they just know what's going on because they've been through the same thing.
[02:11.70]Everyone's so much fun and we all act like family and I can be myself around everyone.
[02:16.49]It's a family that extends beyond this week.
[02:18.65]You get such a close bond with someone who shares something so intimate as a disease that even after camp's over
[02:25.46]You end up keeping in touch with these people.
[02:27.58]One Step has so many different programs throughout the year that you get to see your friends more often.
[02:31.65]I never want to leave this camp.
[02:33.53]This is the best place.
[02:35.73]It's like a second home to me.
[02:37.23]I tell my sisters and my mom and my dad when I get back, I have too much fun that I forget about them.
[02:44.66]I've heard many campers say this, that they wouldn't actually give up having cancer because without cancer, they wouldn't have camp.
[02:51.09]Sometimes people think, oh, since you had cancer, you can't do these things, but just watch me and I will.
[03:46.76]Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Tip of the Hats 2016.
[03:50.59]We're here at the start of day three, and boy, do we have some things in store for you today.
[03:54.80]But before we get too much into all the fun and festivities, we do want to just take a moment to talk about why it is that we're here.
[04:00.61]What are we doing?
[04:01.13]Well, we are raising money for one step forward.
[04:04.06]And One Step Camp's mission is to put on programs for kids with cancer.
[04:09.47]Their goal is just to provide a place where kids with cancer can just be kids.
[04:12.84]And this morning we'd like to take a moment to actually share a story from one of the campers.
[04:17.27]His name is Ryan Sartori.
[04:19.20]Ryan says, my name is Ryan Sartori.
[04:20.98]You might have figured that out already.
[04:22.98]I am 18 now and a senior at Minooka High School in Minooka, Illinois.
[04:27.53]I am also a cancer survivor.
[04:29.67]When I was nine years old, I was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, also known as ALL, and my world was completely turned upside down.
[04:37.88]I can remember the day I was diagnosed.
[04:40.36]There were so many different thoughts running through my mind.
[04:42.90]What's going to happen to me?
[04:44.04]Will I still be able to play football this summer?
[04:46.49]My main question was, am I going to live?
[04:49.72]I'd heard stories of people getting cancer and dying.
[04:52.63]I was worried one of those stories was going to be about me.
[04:56.30]The doctors and nurses at Children's Memorial in Chicago were amazing.
[05:00.16]It was the hospital that I first found out about Children's Oncology Services, Inc., COSI.
[05:05.21]I was told about a summer camp at Lake Geneva, and my first thought was, not a chance.
[05:09.86]At nine years old, I had never been away from my family for more than a day, and now I'm going to be gone for seven to 14 days.
[05:15.97]On top of that, no phone, no iPod, no communication with anyone at home.
[05:19.69]This was madness to me.
[05:22.22]At home, we talked it over and decided that I should go see what this camp had to offer.
[05:26.67]Little did I know this would become one of the best decisions of my life.
[05:30.58]Camp really helps kids regain some of the childhood that cancer has taken.
[05:34.74]For me, I missed out on countless activities and memory-making events, but through this absolutely amazing organization, I've been able to make up for many things that I missed out on.
[05:43.66]The opportunities that are presented at camp are endless, from skiing in Utah, talking about childhood cancer issues in the nation's capital, to horseback riding in Wisconsin.
[05:52.73]We swim in the summer and ski in the winter.
[05:54.85]We have campfires and sing-alongs, and we are always together making memories with friends, new and old.
[06:00.52]At summer camp, I am in EXCEL, the counselor training program.
[06:04.40]I'm glad to be in this program because I want to make an impact on future campers.
[06:08.36]I was scared the first time I went to camp, and I want to help the kids that are as scared as I was my first time.
[06:15.59]COSI is the best organization ever.
[06:18.08]When I'm at camp, all the other worries of life dissipate.
[06:21.00]I can be myself and not have to worry what other people think.
[06:24.46]At camp, everyone gets the pain of cancer.
[06:27.63]One year, my counselor said to me, you have something in common with every single kid in this room, and that connection is what makes camp so special.
[06:35.85]And so thank you to Ryan Sartori, one of the campers at One Step Camp, for that story.
[06:39.35]And speaking of One Step, I'm actually joined now by Jeff Infusino, the president of One Step Camp, who's here to tell us a little bit more about the program and what we're doing here.
[06:46.21]Great.
[06:46.81]Thank you, Alex, for having me on, and thanks for reading that story.
[06:49.68]Absolutely.
[06:50.74]Ryan is one of the thousands of kids that we take care of every time we have a program.
[06:55.55]And as he was stating, we have 11 different programs, and we try to do everything possible to make the kids feel like kids again.
[07:02.38]Cancer does put a stop in people's lives.
[07:05.18]They think about it and say, is it over, as Ryan was talking about, and by far it's not.
[07:09.65]Our theory is bumping the road and what can we do to help you feel a kid and feel that you can believe in yourself again.
[07:16.22]As Ryan was talking about, it's not about what you're going to camp, but it's also getting that kid factor back, but also talking to other people that have gone through it.
[07:26.67]As we all know, we go through life in many different ways, whether it's school or business or even when we have some kind of illness.
[07:33.12]And we'd like to know what's next and what can we do.
[07:36.12]And I think that's the important thing that we work on is trying to make sure that
[07:39.62]You know, kids understand that we're together.
[07:41.85]We're with them.
[07:42.51]It's a family.
[07:43.87]You talk about it and you look at our video.
[07:46.31]Kids come to our organization to find other kids that have been going through this, but also to start believing that they have a future.
[07:53.84]And, you know, that doesn't happen without what you guys are doing.
[07:57.29]And the Tip of the Hats group, what they've done for the last couple of days and the commitment, the time, the effort.
[08:02.35]Also, the Tip of the Hat community, what we see come across as donations and some of the wonderful stories that have been shared here today.
[08:10.21]Cancer does touch lives of many.
[08:12.69]It's not just about childhood cancer, it's about cancer in general.
[08:15.53]So you kind of parlay that to a child, you know, that we all go through life and say, what's tomorrow?
[08:21.06]Tomorrow's just we're going to get up and do our thing.
[08:22.53]And then, you know, the diagnosis comes in and everything stops.
[08:26.01]So we're there to help them, help mom and dad, and help their siblings because we have multiple programs for families as well.
[08:33.34]So we have a family camp, a brain tumor family camp, and a sibling camp.
[08:36.41]One of the things about sibling camps is siblings are, you know, they're pushed aside a little bit.
[08:41.64]You know, we hate to say that, but it's true because, you know, mom and dad are 24-7 and they're trying to figure out the whole cancer thing with their other child.
[08:48.49]So we give them an opportunity to go through and be a child again and be a kid again.
[08:52.52]And that's, you know, that's the whole thing.
[08:54.62]And they get a chance to say it's about me this week.
[08:57.47]So our whole process here is to send as many kids to camp, get them to many programs that we have.
[09:03.08]If they want to come to all 11, God bless them.
[09:05.02]Let's come on and do this, right?
[09:06.92]And that's what we do.
[09:07.58]But we have to remember that we have 350 wonderful volunteers that come every year.
[09:11.91]We have amazing stories that happen.
[09:14.80]Friday I shared about one of our campers that was a silver medalist in the paratriathlon.
[09:18.89]Yeah.
[09:18.97]Haley Denisovich, and now we have another person that was a childhood cancer survivor that came on, that yesterday was the basketball, won the gold in basketball.
[09:29.04]Really?
[09:29.20]Yep, absolutely.
[09:29.84]I had not heard that.
[09:30.56]That's wonderful.
[09:31.10]Yeah, that's terrific.
[09:32.14]And he was a counselor with us.
[09:34.60]So he didn't start out at camp, but he became a counselor.
[09:37.35]And when you look at it, when you have someone that's all gone through cancer and could be a counselor and share that message, the kids not only have hope there, but they hear from someone that's been there.
[09:46.96]And that's our whole message.
[09:48.48]So
[09:48.92]I can't tell you enough how grateful we are.
[09:52.16]Today is all about how many more kids can we send to camp and how much can the Tippett Hats community support us doing that.
[09:59.07]You guys have a great venue and a great thing, a lot of things going on today.
[10:02.48]And, you know, we're just very, very appreciative of what you do for us.
[10:06.49]Yeah, and by the way, for any of our viewers who don't know, for approximately every $1,000 we raise, we are able to send a kid to camp for one week.
[10:13.96]So bear that in mind.
[10:15.32]Right now, we've got about 117 camper weeks worth of donations raised.
[10:19.86]So thank you so much for that, and can't wait to see what more we can raise today with your so generous support.
[10:24.91]So tell you what, now that we know what we're here doing, I think we're just about ready to throw it over to our players.
[10:29.38]We're going to be joined by Jerma, Razefire, Getawayl, and Admirable.
[10:34.12]Folks, how are you doing?
[10:35.41]Hey.
[10:35.97]Hello.
[10:36.53]Good.
[10:38.09]Pretty good.
[10:38.53]We're doing good.
[10:39.23]Pretty good.
[10:39.73]We're doing pretty good.
[10:40.39]Good morning.
[10:42.17]You hopped into the pub now?
[10:43.12]You all set?
[10:43.52]You all going?
[10:44.68]Oh, we're gaming.
[10:45.30]We're mostly set.
[10:46.32]We're mostly set.
[10:47.22]We're getting in there.
[10:47.88]We're getting there.
[10:48.60]Tell you what.
[10:49.14]Alright.
[10:49.46]We're seeing the game and watching Raze fire now.
[10:52.28]I don't know if that's the best decision.
[10:54.02]Let's watch Raze intently.
[10:56.59]Every time we got to that yesterday, I just died in about five seconds.
[11:00.11]So far, I'm not dead, though.
[11:01.87]So we're already doing better.
[11:03.39]It's good to not be dead.
[11:05.45]Most of the time, yes.
[11:12.34]I'm drinking coffee.
[11:13.14]That's how I'm not dead.
[11:16.16]We all got a cup of Joe in front of us.
[11:18.08]Do you guys have coffee, too?
[11:20.31]Did Joe come by the couch already?
[11:22.57]You got a coffee over there?
[11:23.85]You got a coffee?
[11:24.75]Joe's got to make his rounds, man.
[11:26.07]He's got a lot of people to meet in the mornings.
[11:28.16]Talk to Joe.
[11:29.30]He'll get you.
[11:30.98]Let's straighten you out.
[11:32.24]What are you doing to my computer?
[11:33.26]Let me get my Steam Guard mobile authenticator going here.
[11:36.21]What are you doing to my computer?
[11:38.06]Um, well, we'll see.
[11:40.16]What have you done?
[11:40.88]Here.
[11:42.16]Oh, now I've got to punch you in the secret code.
[11:44.45]My cell phone.
[11:47.14]Yeah, it's like working for NASA or something like that.
[11:50.67]Or something like that.
[11:51.69]Or something like that.
[11:53.19]Thank you.
[11:54.07]TF2, it's like NASA.
[11:57.96]Are you talking about the mobile authenticator thing?
[12:00.18]Yes.
[12:01.12]Yes.
[12:01.60]See, my phone was dead, and I had to log in this morning before we started playing.
[12:05.09]I had to, like, remember the code and run across the room and type it in before it expired.
[12:09.41]I thought I was, like, hacking the system.
[12:11.07]Yeah, the Gibson.
[12:12.63]Are you hacking the Gibson?
[12:14.11]Yes.
[12:14.71]While you guys are hacking Gibsons and planets over there, let me actually read an item donation comment that we have.
[12:19.79]We're trying to make ourselves able to read these item donation comments now.
[12:23.20]I know we've not been able to do that for the rest of the event, but if you are donating items over on scrap.tf slash Toth, you can go ahead and add a comment in there, and we'll try to get to those as well.
[12:33.27]But we have a $196 worth of items donated by Jesse Carr.
[12:39.15]who's one of the co-founders of Marketplace.tf and Scraptf.
[12:43.44]And he just says, for the kids.
[12:44.78]So thank you so much, Jesse Carr, for that donation.
[12:46.45]Thank you for your support of our event.
[12:48.83]Thank you.
[12:49.87]Jesse.
[12:51.91]I know him and Jill have been putting in a lot of work to prepare the item donation stuff, right?
[12:56.98]And so it's cool to see them supporting and doing stuff like that for the event.
[13:03.49]Yeah, I was talking to Jill earlier in the green room and he told me expressly never to mention Jesse Carr, only mention Jill.
[13:10.45]Oh, okay.
[13:10.99]Is that the scam we're pulling?
[13:12.14]Yeah.
[13:12.56]I didn't realize the politics were so complicated.
[13:14.24]Okay.
[13:16.45]So I see we actually have Hiko in the pub.
[13:19.43]Is that the same one?
[13:22.70]The Hiko.
[13:23.34]That is indeed our friend Hiko joining us in the pub.
[13:28.02]That's cool.
[13:28.48]Glad we finally got him in here.
[13:29.38]We've been trying for a while.
[13:31.07]It's been a couple years.
[13:31.89]But he's got that busy CS:GO schedule, but we appreciate him able to find some time for us to join us in this TF2 pub.
[13:37.70]Look at that with the pistol aim.
[13:39.34]Not exactly a 1D.
[13:40.66]We call that the old 15 pistol in TF2, roughly how many shots it takes to take anyone down, but...
[13:45.83]If you get it within that first 15, that's pretty good.
[13:48.09]You can be proud of that one.
[13:49.31]What if the pistol could headshot?
[13:51.22]What if the pistol could headshot?
[13:52.74]Guys, can we please install the ambassador?
[13:56.43]Guys, what if the pistol could headshot?
[13:57.89]We don't install overpowered OPs.
[14:02.54]OPs are banned in this.
[14:03.90]Goodbye, race.
[14:04.82]I'll miss you.
[14:07.66]I'll miss you.
[14:08.41]What are you playing as, a soldier?
[14:10.09]Myself?
[14:10.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:11.33]Soldi.
[14:11.87]I call it Solly, actually.
[14:13.10]Playing the old Solly.
[14:14.02]What's your favorite class in TF2?
[14:16.40]My ideal... I like Soldier, honestly.
[14:19.04]When I play on my stream, I'm a big Soldi.
[14:21.07]No, he doesn't.
[14:22.03]Why?
[14:22.39]What are you getting at?
[14:24.23]Now, there's a skin for the Engineer where you can have a bald head.
[14:28.58]And a lot of people like to see me do that one because it's the Getawayl cosplay.
[14:32.62]That's not on this account.
[14:33.58]I'm playing on Lang's account.
[14:35.39]You have the classic level three chin, of course, but I'd like to think I'm not quite there yet.
[14:38.85]Oh, you mean in the game?
[14:39.69]Oh, yeah.
[14:40.16]No, no, no.
[14:40.64]Okay.
[14:41.06]I've got the level three chin.
[14:43.14]Are you using those community weapons, Mike?
[14:44.96]Oh, I'm using them there, guys.
[14:46.34]You're using them.
[14:47.25]Okay.
[14:47.41]I found your community rocket launcher and your shotgun.
[14:50.95]I'm using those.
[14:51.63]How are you finding it, friends?
[14:52.55]Oh, they're pretty ducky.
[14:53.76]Oh, ducky.
[14:54.42]Okay.
[14:55.60]What is a ducky?
[14:57.31]It's a little duckling.
[14:59.55]Okay.
[14:59.67]A little.
[15:00.11]That's our friend Marxist, actually, who does shoutcasting.
[15:03.72]That's a saying of his that he likes to say.
[15:06.62]That's his answer to, how are you doing?
[15:07.91]I'm just ducky.
[15:08.79]Just ducky.
[15:09.59]I like that, so I picked it up.
[15:11.09]Speaking of just ducky, seem to be every ten seconds crashing in Team Fortress 2.
[15:16.68]Yeah, do you know what?
[15:17.40]We might need to log Jerma into an account that's not my Steam account.
[15:21.51]There's some magical thing happening with my Steam account that's causing it to crash every day.
[15:26.00]Tell you what, can we get some emergency tech support over to the Jerma station?
[15:29.50]We're going to fix this live on the air if we can.
[15:31.56]We need some emergency tech support over here.
[15:32.55]We need someone with a Steam account to log into theirs.
[15:35.91]Sorry, Jerma.
[15:36.69]Just someone.
[15:37.35]Here's my screen.
[15:38.42]I don't know what's causing it.
[15:39.50]See what's happening here.
[15:40.46]It's easy to tell.
[15:41.12]I was healing this scout, right?
[15:43.26]Okay.
[15:43.58]I was following him around.
[15:44.40]I see I've got the beam on.
[15:45.19]I'm doing well.
[15:45.51]We've got the telestrator.
[15:46.47]I'm doing very well here.
[15:49.07]While it was before we crashed, it was doing very well.
[15:51.67]Oh.
[15:52.42]Currently at 300% Uber.
[15:53.54]See, 3-0-0.
[15:54.28]That is a lot of Uber.
[15:56.30]You can see.
[15:57.12]Perfect.
[15:57.68]It was doing really well.
[15:58.60]We're going to see if we can get Jerma fixed back into this game.
[16:01.37]But in the meantime, why don't we check in with Admirable?
[16:04.11]Let's find the Admirable perspective if we can.
[16:06.06]Ads.
[16:06.52]How's it going?
[16:07.14]I'm dead right now.
[16:07.80]You're going to have a lot of trouble finding me.
[16:09.35]I'm dead, mate.
[16:10.01]He's hiding.
[16:11.43]He's in hiding.
[16:12.08]He's ghosted out.
[16:12.74]You're never going to know where he is.
[16:14.01]I can't smell anything because my own butt's too smelly, man.
[16:18.07]Sounds just like him.
[16:19.11]Is that what he says a lot?
[16:20.30]I'm trying to see you from under my humongous bum.
[16:22.98]My mic isn't moving, but the words are coming out.
[16:25.92]All you're talking about ads is bum.
[16:27.12]Oh, you're using the Widowmaker.
[16:28.26]I like that.
[16:29.07]I'm going to read some donation comments here.
[16:30.63]We have $111.11 from David.
[16:34.89]He's got a little accent over the A there.
[16:36.57]Ah, David.
[16:37.27]Ah, David.
[16:38.22]It says, want to thank everyone who is working on this event for putting in days of work.
[16:41.72]Well, we want to thank you, David.
[16:43.72]for that $111.11 donation.
[16:47.19]We have $100 from Raptor, who says, Thanks for this event.
[16:50.49]I'm watching it for the third time now, and it's always fun to watch all the events and hope to see you all at a future LAN.
[16:56.12]Also, Raise H. Can we get some Raise H in the chat?
[17:01.29]Well, that's one of my emotes.
[17:02.39]Oh, that's one of his emotes.
[17:03.49]Yeah.
[17:04.17]Picked it up.
[17:04.75]You're picking up on putting it down.
[17:06.73]You know, I'm not good friends with Joe, so it takes me a while to get going in the morning sometimes, you know?
[17:12.34]Oh, okay.
[17:12.72]You've not made acquaintances with the coffee?
[17:14.20]I have not.
[17:14.88]I am not a coffee guy.
[17:16.02]Got it.
[17:16.56]I'm more of a juicer.
[17:18.38]I'm a juice guy.
[17:19.24]Did you have that juice?
[17:20.01]You had that juice earlier.
[17:21.05]Yeah, it was a good juice.
[17:22.17]Juicer?
[17:22.69]Well, see, I thought it was going to be juice.
[17:24.97]We call him the juicer sometimes.
[17:27.47]What do you grind up?
[17:29.71]Uh...
[17:30.75]Things that taste good.
[17:33.60]You got kale in there?
[17:34.42]You got spinach in there?
[17:35.30]You got apples?
[17:35.98]You got bananas?
[17:37.06]I got it all, dude.
[17:38.73]If you can think of it, it's in the cup.
[17:40.99]That's weird.
[17:42.83]That's weird.
[17:44.96]Don't look into that too much.
[17:46.68]We got an inappropriate boy over here.
[17:50.43]You alright there?
[17:51.11]We're getting Jerma back in here.
[17:52.35]I don't know what's happening.
[17:53.72]I've got a virus.
[17:55.04]Someone told me I have a Trojan horse in my steam.
[17:57.96]What did you do?
[17:58.67]It's the most amazing thing.
[18:00.43]I don't know.
[18:00.75]I play at home fine.
[18:02.29]The second I come to Chicago,
[18:04.55]It's freezing up computers left and right.
[18:07.00]It's the happy birthday virus.
[18:08.30]When you got it buzzed through the TSA device.
[18:11.28]Yeah, they messed it up.
[18:12.91]I think they fried it.
[18:14.75]Mike, did this happen at last tip of the hats, or did we never let you play at last tip of the hats?
[18:18.03]Do you know what?
[18:18.50]I may have never played.
[18:19.30]I don't think we ever let you play.
[18:20.52]I was in that little back room with the chains on me and didn't see much of the outdoors.
[18:25.87]Sorry.
[18:26.05]I mean, this is actually the first time I think we've had you playing during this event.
[18:28.85]It might be the only time as well.
[18:30.09]Maybe we need to...
[18:31.12]Well, listen, like I say, it's not a problem with the person.
[18:33.92]There's something happening with my Steam account, and I can't explain it.
[18:36.84]Right.
[18:37.53]Can't explain it.
[18:38.35]It is beyond explainable.
[18:39.39]Was that familiar to you?
[18:40.31]If we have any doctors out there, what's that?
[18:42.25]Was like that frozen screen a familiar thing?
[18:44.80]Ever since I got here, when we go on my Steam account and play TF2, it freezes after a couple lives.
[18:51.53]I don't understand it.
[18:52.75]Anyone in Twitch chat, how is that possible?
[18:55.28]Can you tell us?
[18:57.26]I think you've been hacked, man.
[18:58.24]How is that possible?
[18:59.02]And it's nothing to do with the computer.
[19:00.93]It's the account.
[19:01.81]We even turned off the Steam cloud.
[19:03.17]Hypothesis.
[19:03.83]Let's see what happens.
[19:04.69]It still didn't work.
[19:05.65]While we're waiting for the security report on the getaway Steam account hacking, I have a few more donation comments here I'd like to share with you all.
[19:11.92]I have $150 from William Roivas, who says, just doing my part to support you in this event.
[19:17.00]And he even capitalized the E in events.
[19:19.59]Wow.
[19:19.91]Really just marking this as being that important, worthy of being a proper noun.
[19:23.47]Thank you so much, William.
[19:24.19]The event.
[19:24.37]The event.
[19:25.23]Welcome to the event.
[19:26.70]Willkommen.
[19:28.10]I have $11.25 from sadly, but that S is a five there.
[19:32.91]That's a little bit of computer lingo.
[19:34.39]Cool.
[19:34.68]For those of you not in the know.
[19:36.38]Who says, love what you guys are doing with this event.
[19:38.22]This event makes me not be 5AD anymore.
[19:40.93]That's sad.
[19:41.59]Also in computer lingo.
[19:42.83]Maybe he's talking about the year 5 AD.
[19:44.76]Yeah, makes him not be in the year 5 AD.
[19:47.12]He actually, he unfortunately fell back in time.
[19:49.30]That's terrible.
[19:49.70]When Jerma fell through the wormhole into this venue, someone, you know, nature has to be balanced for every action.
[19:56.21]You all know.
[19:57.56]And sadly was actually sucked back through to the year 5 AD.
[20:00.92]But with that $11.25 donation, the wormhole was like, oh, yeah, that's the toll.
[20:04.85]You can come on through.
[20:05.91]And he's back in now.
[20:06.73]So thank you so much for coming through the wormhole with that donation.
[20:10.30]Thank you very much.
[20:11.96]What the heck?
[20:16.77]Thank you very much.
[20:17.19]Thank you very much for that one.
[20:18.11]Jeremy does this character called the guy whose voice doesn't work.
[20:24.33]I think you might need more juice, man.
[20:26.84]That was like so many times.
[20:28.14]Laryngitis.
[20:30.94]Sudden onset of laryngitis.
[20:32.88]The character's name is Larry Laryngitis.
[20:35.89]What the hell is going on?
[20:37.27]Okay.
[20:37.79]Got a frog in the old...
[20:39.60]I think the computer bug, it's moved to him.
[20:42.87]Now it's just in him.
[20:44.39]I gotta get away from this computer.
[20:45.51]It's contagious.
[20:47.48]It's getting into my bloodstream.
[20:49.76]Seems like you're fine though now.
[20:50.68]You're not crashing.
[20:51.70]Like I say, it's literally somehow only affecting my account.
[20:56.05]No!
[20:56.80]What the heck?
[20:57.50]Right when you say it.
[20:58.68]A virus.
[20:59.34]Maybe it's voice activated.
[21:01.29]You got a virus.
[21:02.43]Do you want to swap?
[21:03.37]You swap out.
[21:04.07]You're a guest.
[21:05.61]You're a guest.
[21:07.30]Go get malware bites.
[21:09.54]While they're doing the hot swap there, I'm going to go through a few more donation comments.
[21:13.99]We have $100 from Boopatee.
[21:16.31]Boopatee, may I just congratulate you on having such an excellent alias?
[21:19.74]Who says, I've been watching Toph since the beginning, and I'm so glad it's still happening.
[21:23.64]It's incredible that TF2 and its community can make such a difference in kids' lives.
[21:28.47]Let's make it to 200,000, and I'm right there with you, and ensure TF2 stays alive when it turns 10 this October.
[21:33.99]Now, can you all believe that?
[21:35.37]TF2 is going to be turning 10 this October?
[21:37.74]Is that right?
[21:38.70]Or is it next October?
[21:40.42]It would be like in the fourth grade or something.
[21:42.47]If it were a child.
[21:43.64]I think TF2 turns nine this October.
[21:45.81]Because it came out in October of 2007.
[21:47.93]Are game years longer than human years?
[21:49.89]Oh, they might be.
[21:51.03]Maybe it's like each one is like one in a ten.
[21:53.02]It's like very close, but just slightly different.
[21:58.20]We figured out the secret to Valve time.
[22:00.79]We have swapped computers successfully.
[22:02.69]Okay.
[22:03.81]I'm going to change this name.
[22:05.12]This is not a name for you.
[22:06.38]No, that's not.
[22:07.54]That's a good old stream joke.
[22:08.78]You don't want that one.
[22:11.46]Danger.
[22:13.37]What's dangerous about it?
[22:15.69]Yep.
[22:18.95]Sounds dangerous.
[22:19.45]I'm just going to leave it at that.
[22:21.04]Yep.
[22:24.26]Yes.
[22:25.10]Yes.
[22:25.76]So, alright.
[22:26.97]I want to see how many, like, ad wares you have and, like, spy wares you have.
[22:31.13]We're getting Nortons on the line here.
[22:32.69]Thanks.
[22:33.05]Shout out to Symantec for sponsoring the event.
[22:35.74]I'm going to call Mr. Norton.
[22:38.08]Call him up on the old telly.
[22:41.37]Hey, what happened to my computer?
[22:42.59]It keeps freezing in TF2.
[22:45.12]Call up my buddy Mal.
[22:46.18]He's going to be like, stop calling me.
[22:48.00]Malwarebytes.

[22:52.03]I can just play Windows Pinball by myself.
[22:56.82]It's not a big deal.
[22:58.56]I mean, it could be worse.
[22:59.54]Windows Pinball is a pretty good game.
[23:01.26]Yeah.
[23:01.72]It is a good game.
[23:02.28]I agree with you there.
[23:04.95]I cosign on Windows Pinball.
[23:09.76]What was the last time you opened Windows Pinball?
[23:12.20]I don't know if I've ever played it, but I heard it's good.
[23:14.44]You've never played Windows Pinball?
[23:16.06]No.
[23:16.75]What?
[23:17.41]Really?
[23:17.85]Like, the classic Windows Pinball with the really loud music and it's in space.

[23:59.44]It was that one.

[24:00.50]It's like the 75... That was just the name of the game.
[24:02.95]The 7500 Windows games or whatever.
[24:06.01]I saw that in Staples, actually, before I saw that you had done a video with it.
[24:09.58]Oh, with the 700,000?
[24:10.20]Yeah, I was like, oh, this is five bucks.

[25:18.02]It's a waiting game at this point.
[25:20.24]Okay.
[25:20.61]Submitted my crash log to Malwarebytes.
[25:24.27]You're waiting for them to give you the full analysis.
[25:26.87]Yeah, you have to pay for it, so they're just giving me a preview.
[25:30.49]Oh, okay.
[25:30.99]You have to buy a monthly, you have to buy a live 365 Microsoft.
[25:37.48]I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
[25:39.18]My Steam don't work.
[25:40.23]Your Steam doesn't work now?
[25:42.89]No, we'll figure it out.
[25:44.59]Don't worry about it.
[25:45.77]Don't worry about it.
[25:47.31]Slowly, slowly your computer is turning rabid.
[25:51.33]Oh, boy.
[25:52.52]My Microsoft outlook is just being ravaged by virus.
[25:56.42]Rhys, can you tell us a little bit about this shotgun heavy strat that you're doing, and this weapon that you have equipped?
[26:01.39]Yeah, so this is the family business, and I like to consider myself a pretty family-friendly guy.
[26:07.37]Okay.
[26:08.26]And so I play the heavy, and I use this weapon specifically to get in character.
[26:13.10]So, you know, I was having a rough morning.
[26:15.12]Turn around, turn around, turn around!
[26:18.79]No, you're not in real life!
[26:21.02]I was like, I was like, what's going on?
[26:23.74]You're like in the middle of this great, he was gonna get us both, and all of you in the middle of this story.
[26:27.63]It's coming right for you.
[26:28.67]Watch out, someone's behind you, they're gonna throw a pie in your face.
[26:32.78]Raze, turn around in real life.
[26:34.24]Turn around.
[26:35.63]I was like.
[26:37.45]It's a camera.
[26:38.83]To be honest, I think I did point over there.
[26:41.30]I think I did.
[26:42.78]You were like... Get out of there.
[26:46.62]You're in danger.
[26:47.40]Somebody's got an ice pick behind you.
[26:50.38]Like a ski mask.
[26:51.32]What would you like to do?
[26:55.19]How would nobody have stopped that guy?
[26:57.57]How did he get in the venue?
[26:58.81]All these production people.
[27:00.05]We got Lang over there.
[27:01.81]And this guy with an ice pick just comes in and gets behind you.
[27:05.12]Just standing there waiting for you to turn around.
[27:08.76]It's giving you a fair chance.
[27:09.86]I was trying to warn you about the spot.
[27:13.97]Uh, anyways, fairly business, yeah.
[27:16.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:17.33]Giving them the business.
[27:18.14]I saw you doing that yesterday too, Raze.
[27:19.84]You were giving people the business as well.
[27:22.06]Give them the business.
[27:23.32]So, realistically, the reason that I used this weapon is because someone saw me using the shotgun once and they said, don't use that, it's bad.
[27:33.44]And so I switched.
[27:34.24]And I don't really know why this is better, but someone said it was better.
[27:38.62]So, that's where we're at.
[27:40.77]Someone somewhere said it was better.
[27:42.43]Yes.
[27:43.87]I'm gonna come pocket you because we need to get your family business.
[27:47.86]I don't know if that's the right decision Well, I can warn you of spies.
[27:52.07]That's true.
[27:52.57]You just like just point behind me like behind you point your direction It's screaming

[29:38.59]We actually have $50 from a real-life friend of mine that I know from elementary school.
[29:44.76]His alias here is Sir Adjusty.
[29:46.72]And he says, keep up the great work, guys.
[29:48.12]Thank you so much, Aaron.
[29:49.02]Glad you're watching the show.
[29:50.79]Shout out to you and George and Nate and Ryan and all those guys.
[29:53.27]Thank you so much.
[29:54.55]We have $300 from Paddy Khan, once again making another appearance, dropping the big, big numbers.
[30:00.04]Says, 300% Ubers will make you crash.
[30:02.96]Please balance Jerma.
[30:04.20]P.S.
[30:04.70]Pancakes rule.
[30:05.44]That's a little add-on for tag there.
[30:07.49]Pancake's pretty good.
[30:09.23]Oh, yeah, I know him.
[30:10.13]We have $10.50 from an anonymous donor who says, I just started work.
[30:13.97]I don't earn too much.
[30:15.31]This is from my very first paycheck.
[30:18.26]We've had so many of those.
[30:19.16]We've had so many of those, and that is just so touching.
[30:21.66]Surprisingly high in number, which is amazing.
[30:24.20]This anonymous donor also says, I wanted to say you're all doing an awesome job.
[30:27.65]Keep it up.
[30:28.23]And a little smiley face.
[30:29.11]That's another classic one.
[30:30.09]Just the colon and the closing parentheses.
[30:31.91]Nothing wrong with that.
[30:32.70]It's tasteful.
[30:33.68]I like that one.
[30:35.12]Jerma, we're watching your perspective.
[30:36.42]Hopefully you've stabilized in this pub.
[30:38.02]Of course you have.
[30:39.05]You've changed computers now.
[30:40.05]We currently have a situation where the red team is really close and we lost.
[30:44.01]You lost.
[30:44.41]That's the situation in hand.
[30:45.42]That's the situation.
[30:46.42]That's our situation.
[30:47.42]The end.
[30:48.24]I'm going to talk.
[30:48.94]Kill this guy.
[30:50.52]There we go.
[30:51.15]Oh, there he goes.
[30:51.77]There's my game crashing.
[30:55.81]I thought I was doing so well.
[30:56.94]I was just about to gloat about it.
[30:59.48]I mean, you can still gloat about it if you want, but now it's just going to be legitimate.
[31:02.38]Boy, my game is so solid.
[31:06.37]The stability here is amazing.
[31:09.16]We've got to get you some updated, what do you got, ATI in the video?
[31:12.93]Listen, these are perfectly fine computers provided to us by iByPower, which has nothing to do with the problem.
[31:20.01]It's my Steam account, which is not sponsoring the event.
[31:24.68]How is this possible?
[31:26.58]It's only my account.
[31:28.65]NVIDIA.
[31:29.13]Doesn't matter what computer I'm on.
[31:31.59]Amazing.
[31:32.33]So like when you're at home and you're playing, does it just like... No.
[31:35.44]I've never had TF2 crash.
[31:37.14]Maybe you plugged into the internet here and it just doesn't like you.
[31:40.06]It's amazing.
[31:41.10]I'm going to validate my game feels.
[31:45.55]Good luck.
[31:48.73]I wonder what's doing that.
[31:51.27]Somebody suggested to me, go into console and put SV crash 0.
[31:55.42]That's a really good idea.
[31:56.53]While you're turning off the crashes in the game, it's weird that your config has that on, Mike.
[31:59.51]We have a tweet from One Step Camp up here on the screen.
[32:02.88]It says, congrats to One Step Camp counselor and childhood cancer survivor
[32:09.33]He's got a Twitter username there.
[32:10.31]You'll all figure it out in the stream.
[32:11.40]Monitor's a little far away from me over here.
[32:12.94]We're winning gold in Rio.
[32:14.64]That was the basketball gold medal that Jeff was talking about here on the couch.
[32:18.59]So that's super awesome.
[32:19.43]Congrats.
[32:20.07]And that is the second medalist that One Step Camp counselors have had at the Paralympics down in Rio.
[32:26.06]So that's just fantastic.
[32:26.96]That's wonderful.
[32:27.46]Good job to them.
[32:28.38]And also, while we're talking about putting things up on the screen, I believe we have just opened the first giveaway of the day.
[32:34.31]worth about 80 keys estimated in value.
[32:36.77]You can enter that giveaway right now for free.
[32:38.47]You don't really have to do anything.
[32:39.41]Just head on over to scrap.tf slash toffgiveaway.
[32:42.54]We'll get that link up on the stream as soon as we can.
[32:44.38]And by the way, if you're sticking around, if you're able to stick around, our final giveaway closer to the end of the day, we think, will be about 500 keys worth of items.
[32:53.91]So you're going to want to stick around for that giveaway at the end of the day.
[32:56.05]Wow.
[32:56.31]A little incentive there for you to keep watching.
[32:57.90]That's keys.
[32:58.72]Thank you for sticking around.
[32:59.74]Wait, and for those of us that don't know the conversion, like, how much is one key?
[33:04.83]Like, in dollars?
[33:08.49]I think it's about $1.80 or $2.
[33:10.91]Someone who plays this game would probably know.
[33:12.47]That's not me.
[33:14.28]I don't play this game.
[33:15.18]I just produce this show.
[33:16.66]It takes too much time to play the game.
[33:18.60]Now, guys, how good is Lang on the host spot, by the way?
[33:22.67]What are you doing wasting your life making good money doing things that use your other skills?
[33:28.60]Should be a host.
[33:30.04]Mike, I'm flattered.
[33:30.98]Thank you so much.
[33:31.66]Let me tell you, being a host, boy, that doesn't pay the bills.
[33:36.07]No.
[33:36.95]But you could do it.
[33:40.08]You got the gumption, my man.
[33:42.86]If I have anything, it's gumption.
[33:44.79]Gumption, yeah.
[33:45.47]We were talking about that earlier.
[33:46.59]Yeah.
[33:47.45]What does gumption mean?
[33:48.89]We were just at Gumption Fest, actually.
[33:50.44]They just had that in Lincoln, Nebraska.
[33:53.28]Not a lot of people there.
[33:54.40]Gumption Fest.
[33:55.63]But what is it?
[33:56.41]Gumption Fest?
[33:57.51]Gumption.
[33:58.57]You mean to tell me Sean has said Gumption Fest in his hometown this whole time?
[34:01.49]Get up and go.
[34:02.29]Yeah.
[34:02.88]Well.
[34:03.34]Wow.
[34:03.72]I thought it was like a kid detective.
[34:07.00]Detective Gumption.
[34:08.06]No, that's Gumshoe.
[34:09.04]You're thinking of Gumshoe.
[34:10.00]Gumshoe.
[34:10.36]Remember the Carmen Sandiego show on PBS?
[34:13.33]That's what I'm thinking of.
[34:14.65]A Gumption.
[34:16.15]I love it.
[34:16.51]A kid detective.
[34:17.39]Hello, Gumshoes.
[34:19.72]That's what they used to call them.
[34:22.66]I'm so dead.
[34:23.76]See, I think of gumption, and then my mind immediately goes to gumbo, and those are, like, not related at all.
[34:29.75]Oh, no, I'm going to burn.
[34:30.81]I'm going to burn.
[34:32.29]I burned.
[34:33.25]Gunboats.
[34:34.89]That's like gumption.
[34:36.37]Gumboats?
[34:39.00]It's a bit of a stretch.
[34:40.54]Yeah.
[34:41.02]I think you're thinking of gum... It's hard to drink coffee with this thing.
[34:46.52]You're, like, pushing the thing out of the way.
[34:49.31]We're going to get those underwater headsets next year.
[34:53.27]If people keep donating, we will at least.
[34:55.40]Underwater.
[34:56.56]Yeah.
[34:57.72]Underwater.
[34:58.76]With a snorkel attached to it.
[34:59.90]Get those overwater ones.
[35:01.68]Guys, how do you feel about Badlands as a pub map?
[35:03.74]I know we all like it as a sixes map, but how do you think about it as a pub?
[35:06.77]I think it's a good one.
[35:07.75]Yeah?
[35:08.05]Yeah.
[35:08.69]It's... Well, okay, it's good until you get to last, and there's, like, ten, like, sentry guns just everywhere.
[35:15.74]But up until that point, it's solid.
[35:17.16]How do you think of this?
[35:19.62]If you're pubbing Badlands, basically the two times you run into the NG on Badlands last is if you're pubbing Badlands or playing against Enigma.
[35:27.51]We're going to run into that NG.
[35:28.87]You're going to have a bad time.
[35:30.69]Shoutouts to Carl Yang Shang backcapping last.
[35:35.50]That's the thing.
[35:38.08]I just tried to play Sniper and I immediately changed.
[35:40.36]I was just like, yeah, play Sniper.
[35:42.43]No, I'm going to go Heavy.
[35:43.57]That's just the way it is.
[35:44.83]I'm not playing the Shoot Head class.
[35:47.21]Not now.
[35:47.97]Shoot Head.
[35:49.77]I'll play the wrap-up guy.
[35:52.42]Now, I will say, if I have to compare Badlands as a pub map to Doublecross, I'm going to pick Badlands.
[35:58.73]When are they adding Doublecross to the ESEA map rotation?
[36:03.01]I think Mr. Slim's working on that campaign.
[36:04.96]Oh, Sleeve, I love it.
[36:06.20]It's going to be universal, too.
[36:07.34]It'll be in every league.
[36:09.45]Look at this.
[36:09.87]We got Jeremy taking in the fatty Tomislav Uber here.
[36:13.17]Cast me.
[36:14.07]We got Jeremy now coming through.
[36:15.92]There's his face on the side of the floor.
[36:18.94]I'll do it as you.
[36:20.12]Apparently I'm casting it as you.
[36:23.87]He walks in.
[36:24.63]He's going to lose his face.
[36:26.41]There's his face on the side of the floor.
[36:29.22]On the side of it.
[36:30.38]Is that how I sound?
[36:31.22]That's what you sound like.
[36:32.26]That's what I sound like?
[36:33.28]Here's Jeremy now.
[36:34.03]He's put his finger on the W key of the keyboard.
[36:37.19]That's a little bit higher pitch.
[36:38.77]That's a little JFK-ish.
[36:41.10]Ask not what your Thomas Love can do for you.
[36:44.02]Ask what you can do for your Thomas Love.
[36:50.49]There it is.
[36:50.93]He's got to kill Captain Hamshank.
[36:53.58]Got him.
[36:55.04]Got to watch out for him, man.
[36:56.10]Oh, Captain, my captain.
[36:59.55]You're not casting.
[37:00.49]You're not shoutcasting me.
[37:01.43]Oh, I'm sorry.
[37:02.15]Excuse me.
[37:02.86]Here he comes!
[37:03.76]Your virus-riddled computer is not as important.
[37:08.48]Sorry, I was casting but not shoutcasting.
[37:10.43]Verifying integrity of game cache.
[37:12.39]You know how many times I've done that?
[37:14.23]How many?
[37:14.43]Once.
[37:14.68]Once?
[37:15.30]In like nine years.
[37:16.46]I'm doing what my parents over there are telling me to do.
[37:19.34]The boss said verify integrity of the game file.
[37:22.53]I swear to God that's in the game.
[37:23.99]That doesn't do anything.
[37:25.55]That bar just fills up.
[37:28.02]That's like a flash animation.
[37:30.14]Yeah, this is someone's project in grade 12.
[37:34.01]It's their programming project.
[37:35.71]Make a status bar.
[37:37.72]Status bar fills.
[37:39.38]Wow, they timed it out too perfectly.
[37:41.78]Look at this.
[37:42.43]Very realistic.
[37:43.55]The textures are very realistic.
[37:47.95]There's going to be one person in chat that's like, actually, oh, my problems were solved.
[37:51.31]My Windows was blue-screening, and I validated TF2, and it worked.
[37:54.74]I booted into DOS and verified the integrity of my game files.
[37:59.69]Suddenly, everything was fine.
[38:01.05]Can we go over just real quick?
[38:02.15]What does that even mean?
[38:03.09]What, DOS?
[38:04.31]No, no, no, no.
[38:05.82]That stands for Microsoft's Distribution of Services.
[38:13.37]Nailed it.
[38:14.19]Yep.
[38:15.45]That stands for Microsoft's Distribution of Services.
[38:20.00]DOS.
[38:23.17]I mean, it sounds legitimate, dude.
[38:24.49]We'll be right back.
[38:25.33]Like, that could be something.
[38:27.47]I don't know if that is the something, but that could be something.
[38:31.61]Well, maybe.
[38:32.44]Maybe.
[38:34.92]Jeez, eh?
[38:35.74]Tell you what, speaking of distributing services, we need to start distributing some of these cash donations around to these donation incentives that we've got coming up.
[38:43.11]We've got four of them today.
[38:44.41]Each of those is at a goal of $10,000.
[38:46.63]The closest one right now is that Scout voice actor donation incentive.
[38:50.82]We're going to have Nathan Vetterlein
[38:52.26]the Scout voice actor, pubbing on our servers, in our Discord, in character as the Scout.
[38:58.25]That is currently at $8,400 out of $10,000, and you'll see these totals and these incentives coming up in that ticker down at the bottom of your screen about once a minute.
[39:06.81]So get your donations in for that if you want to have that met.
[39:09.35]We also have the pipe launcher jump race incentive.
[39:12.08]That's going to be happening at the end of the jump segment is when we're going to be closing that.
[39:16.21]It's a two hour long rocket jumping and sticky jumping segment that the jumpers have been preparing for months.
[39:21.89]You do not want to miss it.
[39:22.87]That segment's going to be fantastic.
[39:24.37]We're also going to have pre-produced movies
[39:26.18]of some really exciting jump content as well, as we always do.
[39:29.58]You know, the jumpers just always come out and force every event.
[39:32.04]They're editing videos, they're recording footage, they're planning awesome races and cool tricks, new freestyle tricks.
[39:38.27]Often, sometimes you're making new maps or modifying maps, coding new plugins to make spectating it an easier, more enjoyable experience.
[39:44.92]And the surfers as well, also putting in a bunch of work, as we saw yesterday in that segment.
[39:48.56]So definitely want to tune in for that.
[39:49.78]Also, we have the Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes speech jammer incentive.
[39:55.17]Let me explain this for you.
[39:56.37]So if you're not familiar with the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player sits at the computer and they see a bomb.
[40:02.54]And they have to describe what they're seeing.
[40:05.22]We're then going to have players here on the couch, each with a paper bomb defusal manual.
[40:10.51]And based on what the player is describing to them, they have to flip through their manuals and tell the player what to do, how to defuse this bomb.
[40:17.46]And if we meet this $10,000 donation incentive, we're going to turn on a speech jammer on all the players.
[40:24.39]And that's going to make them hear themselves on about a 240 millisecond delay and make it extremely hard for them to talk.
[40:31.62]You can go ahead and just Google speech jammer.
[40:33.68]You can find YouTube videos of it, I'm sure.
[40:35.42]But that should be a fun round of keep talking if we can get that going.
[40:39.27]We were testing it this morning before the cameras went live.
[40:41.27]It is something else.
[40:44.97]I had never tried it before.
[40:46.23]It's wild.
[40:47.08]It's going to be real rough for us.
[40:49.20]A lot of us did.
[40:51.30]It's worth it, I promise.
[40:52.90]And then the final donation incentive I want to plug today is actually my own.
[40:57.15]If we get $10,000 towards the TF2 with Guitar Hero controller incentive, I will be playing TF2 on one of these computers with my Guitar Hero 2 Xbox 360 controller.
[41:10.50]Call that the old pyro hero strategy.
[41:14.02]I've got my config all set up.
[41:15.76]My binds are all ready.
[41:17.08]I've been practicing.
[41:18.06]I have the pocket strategies.
[41:20.87]I know the best way to conquer a pub with the Guitar Hero 2 Explorer 360 controller.
[41:27.99]And if we get $10,000 towards that incentive, we'll see that happen.
[41:31.06]And remember, to put your money towards these donation incentives, you need to donate cash.
[41:35.18]Unfortunately, I couldn't code it so you could donate items towards these.
[41:38.40]That's my fault.
[41:39.10]I'll try to do it next year.
[41:40.48]But if you head on over to tipofthehats.org slash donate, click donate cash.
[41:46.21]On the left, you'll fill out how much you want to donate.
[41:48.78]And on the right is where you select your incentives and how much money you want to put towards each of those incentives.
[41:54.29]So again, tipofthehats.org slash donate, donate cash, fill out your donation on the left, select your incentives on the right, hit that donate button, and we'll add that to the total.
[42:03.30]And you'll see that update down in the ticker at the bottom there.
[42:06.49]So a question about the pipe jump incentive.
[42:09.37]Is that just going to be them, like, shooting rollers from Demoman and then just waiting for them to detonate and using that to do a jump map?
[42:15.41]Yeah, so there's all sorts of, like, really advanced tricks you can do with pipe launcher jumping.
[42:21.64]So, I mean, you think about rocket jumping, right?
[42:23.53]Like...
[42:24.68]You just look at the wall or look at the ground, you shoot, you jump, you go.
[42:28.47]Sticky jumping, again, you shoot the sticky and you control when it detonates.
[42:31.65]With pipe jumping, you have to just shoot the pipe and it's going to detonate after a certain time.
[42:36.28]So say, like, you want to jump off the ground.
[42:38.07]Okay, you have to shoot the pipe and then run towards it and jump over it right as it detonates.
[42:41.93]Little tricky, sure.
[42:43.05]But what if you need to, in midair, get another boost off of another pipe?
[42:47.88]you have to precisely aim it, such that it will arc and detonate at the exact spot where you're going to be, so you get the boost from it.
[42:55.79]Like, the skill ceiling is ridiculously high, and some of the tricks you can do with pipe launch jumping are really cool, so definitely want to get in towards that segment.
[43:02.22]Again, we'll be closing that near the end of the jump segment, so you have, like, most of that two-hour jump segment to get your donations in for that.
[43:10.15]Don't miss it.
[43:12.25]Okay.
[43:12.77]Jerma, you just bopped them.
[43:14.15]Yeah, I got, like, stuck in the corner over there.
[43:15.59]Jerma, you're bopping people.
[43:18.01]Trying to get a bop chain.
[43:19.17]There it goes.
[43:19.77]Holy mack.
[43:20.99]Oh, Jerma, Jerma, you have to do it all.
[43:22.65]I didn't do it.
[43:24.31]Can we get some heels on Jerma so he can be a boopy bopper?
[43:26.70]Hey, cool map you got here.
[43:27.90]Yes.
[43:28.98]That's a good map.
[43:29.66]It's one of the launch maps.
[43:30.80]It's called Crash Test.
[43:34.87]Crashy.
[43:35.75]That's a cool screenshot.
[43:38.34]Would you just stop?
[43:41.90]Oh, that was in brackets.
[43:42.88]Sorry.
[43:43.20]He, he, he in brackets.
[43:44.39]He, he, he.
[43:44.81]Yeah, right.
[43:45.87]Right.
[43:47.13]Well, this is infuriating.
[43:49.12]I can see why we didn't have Ghetto Whale as a player.
[43:52.14]You can't play the game for more than five minutes.
[43:56.93]Thanks, Gabe.
[43:58.11]Can we get Gabe on the phone?
[44:00.03]Gabe, you got some words for him.
[44:01.74]I verified my game cache.
[44:03.44]He'd probably tell you to get Linux.
[44:05.20]Well, what's that?
[44:06.17]He's using Windows.
[44:08.63]What is that?
[44:09.21]Well, your problem is you're using Windows.
[44:10.87]That is your problem.
[44:13.42]I can just shoutcast Jeremy.
[44:20.31]I mean, J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-
[44:39.78]What up, Jari?
[44:40.80]Alright, so we got Jari now coming through.
[44:43.89]He's got his gloves.
[44:44.83]He's coming around the corner here.
[44:45.87]What could be around the corner?
[44:46.76]Nothing there.
[44:47.28]There's a soldier, though, over there in the window going down below now.
[44:50.77]He's looking at the point.
[44:51.83]He's got his fists out.
[44:52.77]He smacks him down.
[44:53.97]Boy, oh, boy.
[44:55.48]360 punches.
[44:57.82]Being thrown a mile a minute.
[44:59.92]And now we've got Pyro, God's class.
[45:02.07]That's young Ian there wearing the Pyro face.
[45:06.07]Yo, Ian, when did you put these stunner shades on?
[45:08.29]Don't worry about it.
[45:09.25]I didn't even notice.
[45:10.14]Don't worry about it.
[45:10.88]Where were you keeping those?
[45:12.64]I can't reveal my secrets.
[45:13.96]Yeah, I'm going to come over there and stone cold stun you.
[45:17.57]I don't... What?
[45:19.59]I don't even think you need to do that, man.
[45:20.75]I think the ice pick guy already did that.
[45:23.11]Yeah.
[45:24.08]Ian, hit this dude to the car battery.
[45:26.20]Oh, you almost had him.
[45:26.90]Nice pick, guy.
[45:27.22]Almost had him.
[45:27.92]Almost had him.
[45:28.44]You can't fight hap- captain, hap- hapten, captain.
[45:31.81]Hampton.
[45:32.49]Cam- camshank.
[45:33.81]Well, we're figuring out how to say captain.
[45:35.47]Another speech jammer.
[45:36.74]We're gonna drop in- Well, we're turning off the speech jammer on all of our players over here.
[45:40.10]We're gonna read off a few more of these donation comments.
[45:42.80]We have $100 from an anonymous donor with no comment.
[45:45.47]Thank you so much for that $100.
[45:46.85]It's such a big donation.
[45:48.19]We have $1 from SuperNovaFox, who says, "'Last donation of the day.
[45:52.78]Fish!'
[45:53.46]Thank you for that, SuperNovaFox.
[45:55.24]I remember that.
[45:55.74]We have $50 from an anonymous donor who says, you guys are awesome.
[45:58.63]No, you're awesome, anonymous donor.
[46:00.11]Thank you for that $50 donation.
[46:01.81]We have $30 from Ipoli, who says, watch every year, and it's always an amazing event full of amazing people.
[46:07.64]Much love to everyone involved with Toth and One Step Camp from the whole Hugs.tf crew.
[46:12.41]Thank you so much, Ipoli.
[46:14.07]We have $150 from BendyStraw.
[46:17.44]who says, this is my third year with Toth and sixth year with TF2.
[46:20.84]And while I don't play the game anymore, I still love everything the Toth community does.
[46:24.97]Also, I love Jerma and have been watching for four years now.
[46:28.21]Can he say happy birthday to Bayzine and myself today?
[46:32.22]Also, you seed at 150.
[46:34.50]Happy birthday, Bayzine.
[46:36.34]And yourself.
[46:37.17]They've been watching for four years.
[46:38.47]That's a long time.
[46:39.69]Have they used the bathroom?
[46:42.23]Guys, we're offline for most of the year.
[46:43.87]You don't have to keep the stream open.
[46:45.73]But you know those VODs, man.
[46:47.15]They just keep them on replay, man.
[46:49.43]Non-stop.
[46:50.72]They are.
[46:51.52]You gotta eat.
[46:52.26]We have $150 from Gurkak, who says, So happy to be watching Tip of the Hat 2016.
[46:57.78]I hope this donation makes a child extra happy at camp.
[47:00.57]Hashtag for the kids.
[47:01.55]And I'm sure it will, Gurkak.
[47:02.65]Thank you so much.
[47:03.77]We have $10 from Atsboom, who says, Keep up the good work.
[47:08.08]Thank you.
[47:08.52]Can you give me the spelling on those usernames?
[47:10.90]Because they were a little... Yeah, so the last... So Gurkak was G-U-R-K-E-C-K.
[47:15.93]Gurkak.
[47:16.85]Gurkak.
[47:17.77]Gurkak.
[47:18.87]And then Atsbum was A-T-Z-E-B-U-M-M.
[47:23.58]There was a Z in there.
[47:24.50]There's a Z in there.
[47:25.64]Atsbum.
[47:26.42]I feel like we're on the final round of a spelling bee.
[47:31.03]Can you use Gurkhek in a sentence?
[47:33.81]No, I cannot.
[47:34.71]Country of origin, please.
[47:35.97]Country of origin.
[47:37.56]We have $10 from the Aragonian who says, Make good use of this.
[47:40.78]Got another smiley face here.
[47:42.10]Ready.
[47:42.34]I don't know if you've seen this one before, but it's a colon.
[47:44.93]Capital D. Capital D. Big old happy smiley face in there.
[47:48.93]It's looking real happy on this page.
[47:50.43]Wow.
[47:51.39]Capital D was my nickname in high school.
[47:54.11]Why was that?
[47:55.36]Never could figure out why.
[47:57.72]Capital D. Yeah.
[47:59.66]Big D?
[48:00.20]So speaking of internet emoticons, what's everyone's favorite internet emote?
[48:04.39]I like the smiley face.
[48:05.45]Upside down smiley face.
[48:06.78]Well, sorry.
[48:07.70]Different strokes.
[48:08.42]Sorry, you lose.
[48:09.38]But what really is upside down?
[48:11.18]Aren't they all sideways?
[48:12.41]Sorry to interrupt you guys, but we actually just got... I have two pieces of news to share.
[48:16.23]One, we have a $1,000 donation that just came in from Justin47, and I have the comment right here.
[48:22.76]Justin says, Hi, everybody.
[48:24.12]I discovered Toth in its first year and fell in love with the event, the production, and the people.
[48:29.19]At the time, I was drifting without a direction, struggling in my personal and professional life, but tuning in and seeing the dedication of all the event staff refreshed my motivation and life.
[48:38.06]I especially want to thank Lang.
[48:39.22]Oh, that's me.
[48:39.71]Thank you.
[48:40.49]who I discovered following the event.
[48:42.47]Seeing his incredible commitment, selflessness, and huge heart filled me with determination.
[48:47.00]If I knew that I could be half as dedicated as Lang, wow, thank you, I could do anything.
[48:51.82]Since then, I've finally been able to find stable work as a software engineer, and I couldn't be happier.
[48:56.13]Congratulations, Justin, that's amazing.
[48:58.52]I want the staff of Toth to know that even though I don't have a personal connection to cancer, Toth saved my life.
[49:05.33]Please consider this donation the least I can do to thank the incredible producers and event staff, especially Lang.
[49:10.93]And of course, dollar sign for the kids.
[49:13.82]Thanks.
[49:14.44]Justin, thank you so much.
[49:15.50]Congratulations on landing a job as a software engineer.
[49:17.46]And yeah, that's truly amazing.
[49:19.01]Wow.
[49:19.49]Thank you so much for that $1,000 donation.
[49:21.03]And I know you guys were just talking about what your favorite emotes are.
[49:23.63]I believe we actually have a special offsite guest who we can ask.
[49:26.24]Hiko, what's your favorite emote?
[49:30.89]That's a good question.
[49:31.98]I have to go with Kappa.
[49:35.00]Every time I see Kappas in the chat, it just puts a smile on my face.
[49:40.17]He likes the Kappas.
[49:41.44]Kappas are pretty good.
[49:43.28]Timeless.
[49:44.40]What's your favorite Kappa variant?
[49:47.53]Kappa pride I like rainbows you know Kappa Ross is a big one as well I'm into the Kappa Ross I actually used to look like the Kappa rossimo when I was younger I had a nice pro going on it was great that's cool that's good so hiko I believe you're playing the spy class right now is that correct I was when I was in there yeah oh you were okay we got we got you knocked out I guess
[50:10.63]I was told to leave, so yeah.
[50:13.08]We told you to leave.
[50:14.88]Hey, Hiko, you want to join the Discord?
[50:16.62]But please leave the pub immediately.
[50:18.65]That would be great for the show.
[50:21.11]Sorry about that.
[50:21.71]I guess a little miscommunication, perhaps.
[50:23.28]But yeah, Hiko, thank you so much for joining us.
[50:25.46]So I'm going to tell you, what is your connection to Tip of the Hats here?
[50:29.57]How did you find us?
[50:31.30]uh actually one of your your staff members mala I I used to be pretty good friends with her and she told me about this and I think I was planning on actually coming out to Chicago last year yeah you were but I yeah but I had a tournament and same thing with this year I'm actually leaving uh tomorrow morning for a boot camp for one of my CS:GO events oh fantastic couldn't
[50:54.24]Couldn't attend both years, but I'm pretty big into charities, and I really identify with charities that are for children.
[51:04.37]So it really is a good cause, and I really do like what this is all for.
[51:10.30]Yeah, well thank you so much, and of course we appreciate you putting in the effort to try to participate every year, and listen, believe us, we understand.
[51:17.83]It's okay with you being too good at Counter-Strike.
[51:19.95]You're busy, you got stuff going on.
[51:21.52]We understand, and I remember actually last year, that qualifier that you were playing in that would determine whether or not you could make it, we were all actually watching, and we were like, we're really conflicted because we want him to win and be able to go to this tournament, but we want him to lose so he can come to Tip of the Hats.
[51:37.68]That'd be great.
[51:38.84]My team actually won last year, so hopefully we win this year, too.
[51:44.10]Yeah, exactly.
[51:44.52]We'll all be watching.
[51:45.23]We'll all be rooting for you.
[51:46.71]Super excited for it.
[51:48.31]Thank you so much, Hiko, for supporting the event.
[51:50.03]Maybe one of these years we can get you to come out.
[51:51.81]Maybe one of these years the schedule will line up.
[51:53.65]I don't know.
[51:54.54]That's yet to be seen.
[51:55.60]But I'll tell you what, as we're moving through here, we've got a few minutes left in the segment.
[51:59.28]I do want to get to just a couple more of these donations.
[52:03.67]I have $10 from Tectonic Improv, who says, Legend of the Sport.
[52:07.83]I think we have the legend of the sport, Rick Flame, in here a little bit earlier in this pub.
[52:11.86]Actually, it might be in here.
[52:13.02]We have a player named Rick Flame, a master of the sport.
[52:15.85]Is that an upgrade or a downgrade from legend?
[52:18.35]That's going to be an imitator.
[52:20.12]That joke will be funny, I think, forever.
[52:21.88]Yeah, no, it's going to keep going.
[52:23.42]That'll be a good one.
[52:25.00]We have $2 from LilRaptor, who says, Hello Toth, LilRaptor here.
[52:29.05]Huge fan of your charity event, as this is my third year as a donor.
[52:32.42]Also awesome to see Jerma is on this year.
[52:35.12]He says, Hey San, which is hello in Swedish, to all in Toth and Jerma, thank you for the little Swedish lesson.
[52:41.33]LilRaptor, thank you so much.
[52:42.97]Thank you very much.
[52:45.35]Son of BigRaptor.
[52:46.56]Son of BigRaptor.
[52:49.92]That's just a size thing.
[52:51.77]I'll tell you what.
[52:52.41]We do just want to thank Hiko real quick for stopping by.
[52:54.70]He has to go.
[52:55.16]He's a busy man.
[52:55.86]Lots of Counter-Strike going on.
[52:56.92]But, Hiko, thank you so much for poking your head and playing some Spy with us and popping into the Discord.
[53:02.54]Thanks, and good luck this year again, and I'll be watching.
[53:05.95]Alright.
[53:06.17]Thank you so much, Hiko.
[53:06.81]We'll see you around.
[53:07.55]Thanks, man.
[53:08.01]Thanks.
[53:08.59]Take care, dude.
[53:11.27]Bye.
[53:11.37]As you're on top of Spy or sawing people, are you doing some medic-ing, uber-chaining going on here with Quick-Fix?
[53:18.44]I tried healing Jerma, but he was...
[53:21.46]Underperforming, let's say, so medics are just bounding together here.
[53:25.38]What did you say?
[53:26.04]What?
[53:26.52]Do you need to borrow the ice pick?
[53:27.60]We can bring the guy back in here.
[53:28.96]Oh, excuse me.
[53:29.46]I'm not that tall.
[53:30.08]I got to stand up to see you.
[53:33.13]Wow.
[53:33.75]I know there's not much coffee in here, but I mean, you know, I could throw that in your face at any moment.
[53:41.57]For the kids.
[53:43.10]For the kids.
[53:44.32]Guys, if we hit 200,000, we're going to burn Admiral's head.
[53:50.46]Using this coffee in my glass.
[53:52.55]It's probably not a great idea.
[53:54.85]I was underperforming.
[53:55.81]We have fun here, guys.
[53:56.91]We have fun.
[53:58.11]Oh, is this underperforming?
[53:59.88]Oh, is this underperforming?
[54:01.18]And here he goes again.
[54:02.16]Go for another hit!
[54:03.76]Oh!
[54:04.04]Look, it crit me.
[54:05.76]That was a crit.
[54:06.24]It's always the crit, man.
[54:07.62]Can we look into that?
[54:08.33]There was a glitch in the game.
[54:09.37]I thought you froze it again.
[54:12.11]No, no.
[54:13.43]Jeepers.
[54:14.21]I just saw the frozen screen.
[54:16.82]You just, like, leaned back into the chair.
[54:26.81]I can't believe it.
[54:27.35]It can hear us.
[54:28.62]Amazing.
[54:29.26]It can actually hear us.
[54:33.06]That is freaking crazy.
[54:34.41]One of those self-aware viruses.
[54:36.43]Tell you what, I think on that cue, we're going to wrap up this segment.
[54:39.15]Just got two things I want to get to here.
[54:40.74]First off, I have a few more item donation comments I want to go through.
[54:44.42]We have $3.92 worth of items from Decision.
[54:51.74]who says, love you guys and what you're doing.
[54:53.40]Heart, more coming soon.
[54:54.74]Winky face.
[54:55.32]Oh, thank you so much for that little winky face in there.
[54:57.78]We have $9.80 from 3xlneat, who is a scrap.tf admin, by the by.
[55:02.69]He says, I have been watching Tip of the Hats for a few years and been enjoying it a lot so far.
[55:07.04]My dad was a victim of cancer, which started on his intestines.
[55:09.96]and fought against it for two years.
[55:11.88]Sadly, he lost his battle, four years, but still lives through us.
[55:16.75]Some days ago, before the start of the event, it was the fourth year without him.
[55:19.94]And as a family, we are still together and leaving flowers from time to time.
[55:23.60]Cancer completely changes your life, from the moment it's detected to the moment to which that person passes away, leaving a scar within you.
[55:31.19]I hope the money that we all have been donating brings a smile to a lot of kids, making them forget that they even have cancer, enjoying life for the kids.
[55:38.40]P.S.
[55:38.84]Jesse Carr is best car.
[55:40.23]And that's exactly what our donations are doing here.
[55:41.97]Again, this is all going to One Step Camp, which provides these camp programs for kids with cancer where they can just be like kids.
[55:49.26]That's what we're doing here.
[55:50.41]And about every $1,000 that we raise can send a kid to camp for about a week.
[55:54.05]And remember, One Step has all sorts of camps throughout the year.
[55:56.11]They've got their summer camp.
[55:57.20]They've got their winter camp.
[55:58.10]They've got their ski trip.
[55:59.00]They've got the Dude Ranch program where they do horseback riding and all sorts of fun stuff.
[56:02.50]I actually really want to volunteer at the Dude Ranch program because I actually used to volunteer at a stable.
[56:08.23]Not a lot of people know that.
[56:08.97]I actually know how to ride a horse.
[56:10.21]I'm actually not bad at it.
[56:11.40]I'm actually kind of OK at it.
[56:12.28]Do you really?
[56:13.06]I actually, yeah.
[56:14.14]I'm not bad.
[56:14.68]Humble brag.
[56:15.40]Wow.
[56:15.68]A little bit of a humble brag.
[56:16.26]I don't even know if it's like a humble brag.
[56:18.85]He's just like, yeah, I'm pretty good.
[56:20.91]Yeah, I'm a little bit of a cowboy.
[56:22.43]I'm pretty good.
[56:23.85]Hey, cowboy.
[56:24.43]Pretty good.
[56:26.08]But yeah, the Dude Ranch program, I think that'd just be really fun.
[56:27.98]Just going up in the beautiful Wisconsin Dells with the camera, taking some photos of nice autumn scenery.
[56:32.73]Unfortunately, that program happens, I think, the same time as Tip of the Hats every year.
[56:35.89]Last year it was happening during Tip of the Hats.
[56:37.67]Maybe we'll just move the whole show so I can volunteer at that camp.
[56:40.28]Ride some horses.
[56:41.16]Probably be a good idea.
[56:42.34]And this last item donation comment I want to read here is from The Bird Excalibur, which is a lovely alias.
[56:47.91]Can I just say, I'm a fan of the name The Bird Excalibur.
[56:52.56]Donating $98.39 worth of TF2 items over on scrap.tf.com.
[56:58.23]uh says first time I've ever donated I am a survivor of a rare blood cancer called leukemia I was able to experience a similar camp to one step camp and it's great to have these types of supportive programs to make you feel normal again I'd like to send a shout out to my old pal rick flame and a shout out to my best friend evan who died to a brain tumor actually unfortunately and may he rest in peace thank you so much bird excalibur we do also want to give a quick update
[57:22.87]on the pins.
[57:24.05]So these jaunty pins here, you see this one I'm wearing, it is quite jaunty.
[57:27.10]Initially, we had about 150 of these made.
[57:29.39]We sold out of all those, but they were so popular, we had Jazz Butts, who designed these enamel pins and had them manufactured.
[57:36.06]We actually have a second bash that we had printed up.
[57:38.53]And of that second batch of 150, 95 of them have already been snatched up.
[57:43.54]We have 55 of these pins left.
[57:45.84]You can pick those up over at tipofthehats.bigcartel.com.
[57:50.14]And we'll have that coming up down here in the lower third in just a moment for you.
[57:53.35]So you can see that link.
[57:54.51]That is, once again, tipofthehats.bigcartel.com.
[57:57.90]You can pick up one of these pins.
[57:59.10]Each one is about $30.
[58:01.51]And with that, we're actually going to throw it to a break.
[58:03.21]We need a setup for the next Source Filmmaker segment.
[58:06.16]And trust me, you do not want to miss that one because we're going to have Uber Chain and Kronkodile once again joining us, showing us more of their SFM wares.
[58:13.69]Sideshow is going to be sitting where I'm sitting, hosting the segment.
[58:16.21]And on the couch, we're going to have Admirable and Geel.
[58:18.57]That should be a good combo for that segment.
[58:20.10]I'm pretty excited about it.
[58:21.22]Tell you what, we're going to throw it to a break.
[58:22.52]And when we come back, we'll have Source Filmmaker.
