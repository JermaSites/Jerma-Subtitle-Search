[00:50.50]Little early.
[00:52.94]Don't mind me.
[00:54.82]Just making a quick fire.
[00:56.82]Like the cavemen used to do.
[00:58.56]No, it's freezing in here.
[01:03.87]It is a chilly.
[01:06.39]Like 49 degrees in this room.
[01:13.47]23 hours and 56 minutes late.
[01:14.42]What are you talking about?
[01:18.34]How am I that late?
[01:19.06]What did I do?
[01:22.34]I'm six, I'm a full six hour minutes early.
[01:27.55]Right?
[01:28.45]Because if you count like 24 days in an hour, like 24 days in a day, and you got 24 hours in that day, I'm not gonna make that joke because I already, I already just, you know the meme where you see the fucking numbers, it's like that lady that's looking left and right and there's all the equations around her?
[01:47.04]I just did that to try to do my own joke and it didn't work.
[01:52.47]Anyways, we're going to play Alpha Protocol tonight.
[01:55.79]I don't know anything about this game.
[01:59.13]I remember one of my college roommates played this game.
[02:04.11]I looked at the screen while he was playing.
[02:10.87]Maybe two minutes total over the course of four days.
[02:13.38]I know it's like a third-person shooter and there's skill points.
[02:18.13]And it's an obsidian game.
[02:19.59]I think that's all I know.
[02:21.10]I mean, I think that's all I know.
[02:22.60]Am I on trial?
[02:26.04]I will be soon.
[02:28.97]Anyways, give me a minute.
[02:30.39]We're going to switch over to the game.
[02:32.05]See you guys in about two minutes.
[02:56.46]And right off the bat, thank you to Stix Renegade, thank you Stix for the $1.
[03:00.54]Stix is fun fact number 9191.
[03:03.66]Canada has bagged milk.
[03:06.68]Why the fuck do they have milk in a bag?
[03:08.22]Well, it's the same reason why they have boxed water.
[03:12.32]You notice that?
[03:13.82]You got your bottle of water, you have the water from the sink, and then you have boxed water.
[03:21.67]I don't know what the hell that's about.
[03:26.03]jugs not everywhere in Canada yeah they have boxed water they have like boxed water it's like it's like an extra like a dollar eighty and all it says look I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna give you like a little bit of a little bit of a trend that I think I don't necessarily agree with it's like let's take thing and add two bucks to it and then say on label of thing
[03:52.04]The reason why this is so expensive is because it's so natural and sustainable.
[03:57.30]And good for you.
[03:59.50]Motherfucker, go eat an apple.
[04:01.80]You know what I mean?
[04:04.41]Look, I'm a big fan of smoothies and juices.
[04:07.43]Like, you know, make a juice at home in a smoothie.
[04:10.87]Dude, don't go to Whole Foods and spend $5 on cucumber water.
[04:17.17]Don't do that.
[04:18.98]Eat a grape.
[04:20.14]Eat a handful of grapes.
[04:21.68]That's all you're gonna do.
[04:23.26]Grapes, a fucking hundred grapes are like four dollars.
[04:29.12]Just take a handful of them and eat them.
[04:31.34]Don't go spend like 30 bucks on grape water.
[04:39.65]Anyways, let's switch over to the game.
[04:42.69]Give me one second.
[04:54.72]Alright, you'll hear the, uh, you'll hear it in a second.
[04:59.91]There we are.
[05:00.33]Uh, I don't know how loud, this is probably loud.
[05:03.83]So let me go ahead and fix that audio.
[05:08.11]Turn these effects down a little bit.
[05:10.54]I am using an Xbox One controller.
[05:12.34]That should be good, right?
[05:14.92]How's that?
[05:15.30]Maybe a little bit more?
[05:19.12]We'll find out real soon.
[05:22.94]It's too quiet.
[05:25.51]No, it isn't.
[05:26.83]It's perfect.
[05:28.05]It's perfect.
[05:29.25]It's perfect.
[05:30.49]It's perfect.
[05:32.83]Okay.
[05:33.87]New game.
[05:34.29]I'm not going to put it on maximum volume.
[05:39.55]Are you guys crazy?
[05:44.47]Hold on.
[05:47.63]Come on.
[05:47.93]You don't think I know how to make perfect audio?
[05:52.96]New game.
[05:53.32]We're gonna do it on normal.
[05:56.94]And, okay, here we go.
[05:58.13]This is where we pick our class.
[05:59.45]I'm ready for this.
[06:01.13]Soldier.
[06:01.51]Decorated for service in the armed forces, your commanding officer felt that general infantry was a waste of your potential.
[06:07.91]Your natural language talent.
[06:10.35]And quick wit.
[06:11.19]Okay.
[06:11.67]Caught the attention of a recruiter for an agency that doesn't officially exist.
[06:17.40]I like that one so far.
[06:18.28]I think that's a good horoscope for me.
[06:21.72]Field agent.
[06:23.42]No stranger to covert operations, you spent the last several years working for the U.S.
[06:26.90]State Department on a boring tech specialist.
[06:31.53]Having made a mockery of every aptitude test sent your way, a brainiac.
[06:36.47]Fearless from birth, the only thought that ever caused you an ounce of panic was the thought of a 9-to-5 job, okay?
[06:44.27]After a remarkable college career, you vanished off the radar of the known world to make your fortune, okay?
[06:51.62]According to your dossier, you've been a mercenary in Africa, a bodyguard to the Sultan of... That didn't do this.
[06:59.49]The on-again, off-again paramour of a European princess and the holder of three patents in Great Britain.
[07:05.57]Yeah.
[07:08.29]My horoscope was right.
[07:09.27]It was like, oh, you found new money?
[07:12.05]life's gonna turn around and then they say something completely off completely wrong and your children are gonna do just fine you're three four-year-olds it's like god damn it like you had it so right yeah uh no this is not me select recruit for an additional challenge though you barely logged you haven't logged into your main channel for three months working for the department of youtube your ambition drive and aptitude caught the eye of a clandestine government agency
[07:41.67]Your path will be difficult.
[07:43.19]With little experience and formal training, you'll have to rely on your wits while you learn your lessons in the field now.
[07:48.87]I'm gonna have to go Soldier.
[07:52.65]Like, funny guy.
[07:54.49]Got a fucking natural talent with language.
[07:58.45]Okay.
[07:59.13]Let's go with this one.
[08:01.23]Oh, lord.
[08:01.83]Alright.
[08:02.23]Okay, so we got... That's like the right brain hemisphere right there, so that's stealth.
[08:07.67]It's a nice side profile of a fucking, like, really, really intelligent brain.
[08:11.76]The stealth skill reduces enemy perception and affords an agent special techniques for going unseen and unheard.
[08:17.38]Yeah.
[08:17.76]Okay, pistols.
[08:20.54]Oh, boy.
[08:21.20]Martial arts?
[08:23.39]I kind of want to do martial arts.
[08:27.53]Pistols.
[08:28.15]How many points do I have?
[08:28.89]I don't have any points.
[08:32.73]This is just what you start with.
[08:33.55]No, I want to...
[08:37.05]I wanna do martial arts.
[08:37.85]Who's the martial artist?
[08:41.27]Okay, this guy you just get to put your own points in.
[08:43.11]Okay.
[08:45.99]Alright, we'll just do this guy.
[08:48.63]Let's do martial arts.
[08:54.17]Okay, so I'm going all in on martial arts.
[08:58.83]What does this do?
[09:00.51]CQC proficiency increases the damage inflicted with all hand-to-hand attacks.
[09:08.12]Alright, so my strike damage is 10 points higher.
[09:12.22]The strike combo ability extends the number of quick strikes Mike can chain together by quickly pressing B. What do you mean this is wrong?
[09:20.89]At the basic level of this ability, Mike's basic three-strike combo extends to four strike... Alright, we increased our Dynasty Warriors attack combination.
[09:28.03]Cool.
[09:29.67]Each level of the melee defense ability reduces the damage received from enemy hand-to-hand attacks.
[09:34.81]So I take less damage from melee.
[09:38.22]The knockback strike is a slower but more powerful variant of Mike's standard CQC attack.
[09:44.70]A successful knockback strike will stagger your victim and push them out of your personal space.
[09:49.79]Hold B to use it.
[09:52.61]Fury sends Mike into an adrenaline rush that increases hand-to-hand damage, reduces the effectiveness of enemy blocking attempts, and slows down the world for a brief moment.
[10:03.35]Alright, so I'm going all in on martial arts, right?
[10:07.98]Martial arts and... Stealth?
[10:13.39]I think I have to put a point into stealth.
[10:14.85]If I'm gonna do martial arts, I gotta sneak up and karate chop people in the back of their necks, right?
[10:21.71]Either that or I'm doing martial arts and shotguns.
[10:25.90]But I do want to use shotguns as my favorite weapon.
[10:30.47]Can I do martial arts, shotguns, and stealth?
[10:34.85]Can I do stealth and shotguns?
[10:37.02]Yeah, I think that's what I want to do.
[10:38.32]Forget this.
[10:40.62]I want to do stealth.
[10:41.62]Can I pull this back?
[10:45.16]I'll remove it.
[10:45.60]Okay.
[10:46.58]Alright, we're going to do stealth and shotgun.
[10:51.48]Alright, no, no, no.
[10:52.72]I'm keeping my original plan.
[10:55.98]Get rid of the shotguns and we're going to do toughness.
[10:59.12]Each level of improved health increases the amount of punishment Mike can sustain before dying.
[11:04.96]Resilience decreases the delay before Mike starts to recover.
[11:09.26]Okay.
[11:10.38]So I have a faster endurance recharge.
[11:13.83]And this is more health.
[11:14.93]But I have three points I can do.
[11:17.89]Sabotage?
[11:20.81]Hmm.
[11:25.17]The interference ability allows Mike to tune his EMP charges to temporarily disable electronic keypads.
[11:30.61]So I can get so martial arts that I can Hulk smash my hands down.
[11:36.01]Well, this is all I can do.
[11:37.36]Actually, hold on.
[11:41.98]Yeah, I'm going to do this one.
[11:42.88]I feel like I'm pretty good with computers.
[11:46.52]Alright, so we got toughness, martial arts, and sabotage.
[11:49.30]We're going to see.
[11:50.14]I don't know what.
[11:51.86]I just committed.
[11:54.42]Committed.
[11:56.60]I never played this game before.
[11:58.17]Here we go.
[11:58.63]This is a SEGA video game.
[12:00.17]Do you know that Sonic is going to be like a plushie in the corner in one room?
[12:02.81]You know that, right?
[12:10.33]We're committing to this build.
[12:14.36]Reset it.
[12:18.64]We got a lot of Agent Smiths on that plane.
[12:25.11]An obsidian entertainment production.
[12:30.79]Mm-hmm.
[12:31.67]That's my arm.
[12:32.89]I'm gonna have like a robot-like calisthenic arm.
[12:38.09]Oh boy, that's pretty great.
[12:44.66]Alright, that's like a 3D Movie Maker plane takeoff.
[12:48.72]I feel like I could have done that in 3D Movie Maker.
[12:55.52]Are we shooting a missile at the plane?
[12:59.20]Oh, it must be a Scud.
[13:04.71]Wait, what is this?
[13:05.91]Why are they shooting a missile at this plane?
[13:09.03]Oh no, it broke off into a bunch of baby missiles!
[13:14.58]Okay, well... We got hit by a rocket.
[13:31.69]That like that wait what was pretty good That's me That's me Frank West what was his name the guy with the camera?
[13:45.53]This is the guy the Capcom right?
[13:46.73]Well, no to take a make that game if anyone is to blame for these events.
[13:49.95]Mr. Thornton It is you
[13:54.58]Alpha Protocol began here, after all.
[13:57.97]I thought I turned on subtitles.
[14:02.55]Three months ago.
[14:03.41]The gray box.
[14:04.19]Location classified.
[14:05.37]I want to turn on my, uh... Come on.
[14:09.91]So that must be me there.
[14:13.24]I got my, uh, my Ethereum address.
[14:15.16]It was, uh, pasted on my shirt.
[14:17.16]That's good.
[14:18.50]Just in case you didn't know, all those are, like, my Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses.
[14:21.54]Just make sure you, like, scan those.
[14:22.38]I feel like I've been hit by a freight train.
[14:25.63]Checkpoint.
[14:28.25]L to move and R to adjust the camera.
[14:35.56]Supersonic shoes!
[14:37.18]Wait, I gotta, what do I have to pick up?
[14:39.92]Wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:40.76]How do I, I don't need to pause the game.
[14:41.81]Acquired in PDA.
[14:47.71]Good, you're awake.
[14:48.97]There are subtitles, what the fuck?
[14:50.55]Oh, when speaking to somebody, you'll enter a timed conversation.
[14:53.60]Choose a stance.
[14:55.52]Suave, aggressive, professional, or sometimes an action or special stance.
[14:59.87]Alright, how are we going to play this?
[15:03.87]Are we going to play... Should I play aggressive every time, suave every time, or professional every time?
[15:13.98]Always suave, aggressive only.
[15:20.36]Suave.
[15:20.86]I'm seeing a lot of... I kind of want to do aggressive 24-7.
[15:26.50]I love how I don't think one person in this chat has said professional.
[15:30.01]Not one of you.
[15:30.69]Okay.
[15:33.03]I wasn't sure how long you'd be under.
[15:34.33]Those tranquilizers were all fast.
[15:36.89]Oh, okay.
[15:37.27]I got aggressive.
[15:38.59]Who are you?
[15:39.43]Why did you drug me?
[15:40.60]My name is Mina.
[15:41.30]And I didn't drug you.
[15:43.56]They did.
[15:44.02]You unlocked Mina.
[15:44.86]They drove to everyone who arrives here to protect the location.
[15:47.90]Or should I play it the way that I would do it?
[15:48.96]I'm not sticking around for any more chemical therapy.
[15:50.56]I'm getting out of here.
[15:53.80]My daily life is like that.
[15:55.22]Oh, shut up.
[15:57.13]Wait a minute.
[15:58.83]Wait.
[15:59.23]Improvise.
[15:59.77]That's what I would do.
[16:00.35]It's not just those three options.
[16:07.67]I thought it was going to be those three options.
[16:10.78]Every time.
[16:11.32]Where's the aggressive?
[16:12.74]I can probably break glass.
[16:15.44]What the fuck is going on here?
[16:16.62]Alright.
[16:18.50]New objective.
[16:19.20]Out.
[16:22.75]Oh, yeah, that's what happens when you do martial... How do I stand up?
[16:28.13]I can't wait to be a martial artist.
[16:29.61]Throw extinguisher.
[16:30.89]In case of emergency.
[16:31.99]Did I not have done that?
[16:34.12]Did I just, like, sound the alarm?
[16:37.10]Oh, goddammit.
[16:39.56]First beat, you attack an enemy in melee.
[16:41.14]Alright, wait a minute, hold on.
[16:42.06]This is so loud.
[16:43.92]Where are the...
[16:54.52]Oh wow, you suck.
[16:58.70]Well, that guy... That guy was really not good at his job.
[17:03.24]I mean, I've heard of terrible henchmen before, but holy shit, dude.
[17:07.21]Break open door.
[17:08.15]Alright, so it's quick open and slow open.
[17:17.15]What's this thing?
[17:17.95]Do I have to pick anything up?
[17:21.54]You need to shut off the alarm.
[17:23.72]Panels on the wall.
[17:24.96]Deactivate the alarm tutorial- oh god damn it.
[17:28.82]Oh my god, look at this maze!
[17:32.53]Alright agent, you have to start on the bottom left and make it all the way to the top right in the maze.
[17:38.75]Imagine that, imagine like I have to go through the whole thing.
[17:43.01]Use L to move between circuits and A to clip a circuit.
[17:45.87]Clip circuits in numerical order to bypass the panel.
[17:51.68]Okay.
[17:52.86]Clipping the wrong circuit will decrease the time left.
[17:55.70]Running out of time will trigger an alarm.
[17:58.34]Clipping all circuits will override the board.
[18:00.46]Alright, let's start the bypass.
[18:04.26]Here we go.
[18:16.61]Master Hacker!
[18:20.18]Guard the lobby.
[18:20.80]Alright, how do I sneak?
[18:26.63]Arm yourself.
[18:27.31]I don't need to arm myself.
[18:28.17]Do I get boxing gloves?
[18:29.39]Do I get comical boxing gloves?
[18:31.55]I need to stop doing that.
[18:32.41]How do I sneak?
[18:34.53]Oh, there it is.
[18:38.58]This is so stupid.
[18:40.02]Enemies are less likely to see you when you're crouched or in cover, making it easier to move around in stealth takedown.
[18:44.48]Alright, is it
[18:49.91]What's their field of view like?
[18:50.85]Do I just press B next to his head?
[18:57.94]God damn it.
[18:59.76]Alright, well, I got him.
[19:00.98]Give me the gun.
[19:03.03]Wait, I thought I just hacked the... Why is this guy not looking at me?
[19:09.75]You...
[19:12.89]What?
[19:14.13]Wait, how?
[19:17.27]How?
[19:17.95]How did you not get hit by any of those?
[19:20.42]I don't understand.
[19:21.26]Put down the... The guy is still in his earpiece.
[19:39.48]Zero gun skill.
[19:42.50]Oh shit.
[19:45.30]I don't have one point in a gun skill.
[19:48.32]Oh no.
[19:49.94]Oh no.
[19:51.73]So do I get to reset the game?
[19:53.49]You need ammunition.
[19:58.91]No, I need to not have zero gun skill.
[20:01.15]Hello!
[20:08.68]I'm a martial artist.
[20:09.52]I gotta stop.
[20:10.10]Just get in there.
[20:14.62]It takes three punches to kill these people.
[20:16.64]Let me go heal now.
[20:19.82]I'm not gonna be able to hit anybody.
[20:21.02]I have to run up and punch people.
[20:27.25]This is gonna be a disaster.
[20:29.93]So you don't pick anything up on anybody?
[20:31.47]They don't drop anything?
[20:33.31]It's just three punches.
[20:34.33]Alright, here we go.
[20:34.99]One, two, three.
[20:45.84]I'm like, I'm really good at that.
[20:47.14]I can't wait to get a bunch of hard ones and you guys get really impressed by my skills.
[20:50.10]Watch out for cameras.
[20:50.88]Watch out for cameras.
[20:51.34]If they spot you or you destroy them, they'll sound an alarm.
[20:54.28]Don't destroy them if I... Okay, I can't destroy them.
[20:57.64]Alright, we got a medical... I can't even say it.
[21:02.73]I can't say it.
[21:03.31]You know what I'm going to say.
[21:04.79]It's the exact same cone from MGS.
[21:08.85]That's easier.
[21:11.21]Is it actually just that cone?
[21:15.21]Yes, I think it's just the cone there.
[21:17.03]Can't destroy it, just need to sneak by.
[21:19.87]Just get in the door, sneak in here.
[21:22.63]Press A to enter cover.
[21:24.85]No, we don't need to enter cover.
[21:31.15]How did he wake up so fast?
[21:32.43]He just got here.
[21:34.73]There it is, the karate chop.
[21:35.85]That guy's not dead.
[21:41.67]I missed.
[21:44.23]That guy's gonna shoot me.
[21:44.95]Just look at that.
[21:45.63]That's just like the end of a fucking horror movie.
[21:47.91]He's pretending to be, he's gonna shoot me with that gun.
[21:52.07]I missed him again.
[21:55.35]I don't think I can hit him.
[22:06.71]Oh man, that sucks.
[22:08.51]I just karate chopped him in the throat.
[22:11.94]I didn't just put the gun down, seriously.
[22:14.56]There's no reason to even use this.
[22:17.48]Just a waste of time for me right now.
[22:21.81]Alright, there's the heal.
[22:22.71]I stopped sneaking around.
[22:23.91]Alright, which one of these, which one of these, like, Dell Inspirons am I gonna get onto?
[22:31.25]Hey, which one of these, like, 2003 every college student computer am I gonna, uh, buy?
[22:38.35]Alright, what's gonna move?
[22:44.11]Anything else?
[22:44.81]Can you sprint in this game?
[22:51.66]Doesn't look like it.
[22:52.34]I feel like I'm going to miss it.
[22:53.98]This is Obsidian, man.
[22:54.84]I feel like I'm going to miss something.
[22:57.18]They're one of those you-missed-it games, aren't they?
[22:59.16]Aren't they one of those companies?
[23:01.54]See?
[23:02.94]You missed it.
[23:04.27]Not me.
[23:05.33]How do you reload?
[23:05.87]Alright.
[23:08.79]X. Okay, got it.
[23:14.24]Okay.
[23:15.80]Just keep following the yellow brick road.
[23:18.24]Put the camera here.
[23:20.30]Put the gun away.
[23:20.98]How do I holster the gun?
[23:27.69]Wait.
[23:28.95]Oh.
[23:29.13]Okay.
[23:36.91]I went the wrong way.
[23:38.31]I'm fine.
[23:38.79]Everybody just relax.
[23:41.70]How do I always do this?
[23:42.87]Because I get turned around easily.
[23:45.23]I'm like a fucking two-year-old.
[23:51.99]Alright, we got... Pick locks on barred doors to gain access.
[23:55.78]Alright, what do we got?
[23:58.08]This door is closed.
[24:00.64]I'm gonna go in here.
[24:01.46]Pick the lock.
[24:02.08]Another tutorial.
[24:02.76]You got it.
[24:04.30]I'm awful at these.
[24:05.50]Use LT to apply pressure to a pin.
[24:07.54]RT sets the pin.
[24:10.73]Align the pin along the sheer line to set it.
[24:15.52]Oh, god damn it.
[24:17.62]Okay, trying to set a misaligned pin will strain the pick and eventually break it.
[24:22.48]Yep.
[24:23.75]Align and set all pins.
[24:25.73]Okay, we go one, two, three, go.
[24:33.63]Oh.
[24:34.79]That's going to be so hard.
[24:35.80]My hands are so terrible.
[24:36.84]I'm going to mess that up a million times as we play through here.
[24:42.15]Special ammo.
[24:44.65]Got full health.
[24:47.39]Cutscene.
[24:54.15]Nice.
[24:55.87]Remember, that instantly kills people.
[24:57.35]Remember, if you trip and you land on your, like, bum, you're knocked unconscious when that happens to you.
[25:09.10]Awareness?
[25:09.62]Special ability.
[25:11.95]Okay.
[25:14.09]I already have this.
[25:15.36]I don't think the game expected me to have my ability already.
[25:25.32]Alright, what does awareness do?
[25:29.85]Oh, it just pins people on the map.
[25:31.09]I get it.
[25:32.81]Okay.
[25:32.99]For like 12 seconds.
[25:36.27]Guy to the left.
[25:37.07]We're going to come back.
[25:38.65]We got a red barrel here.
[25:40.43]Folks, we got a red barrel.
[25:44.47]I'm not getting out of this one without getting rid of this red barrel.
[25:48.96]You understand?
[26:03.44]Oh god damn!
[26:06.62]I missed it!
[26:08.12]I missed it!
[26:09.98]Oh my god!
[26:10.90]I can't believe I missed it!
[26:14.18]I just didn't, there was no reason why that was gonna happen!
[26:17.52]Wait, wait!
[26:27.22]No!
[26:28.38]I missed it!
[26:31.24]No, my camera work!
[26:33.60]I never miss it!
[26:35.54]I didn't know that it was gonna blow the car up!
[26:40.91]That guy went 1,000 miles per hour off the screen, too.
[26:44.15]Oh, that was perfect.
[26:45.47]Oh, what a ruined VOD.
[26:49.90]It's alright.
[26:50.30]I'm going to get out of this.
[26:52.28]Let's see if I can do a little bit of fun gunplay here.
[26:54.00]Check this one out.
[26:54.60]Ready?
[26:55.34]Bing bong!
[27:04.28]How do I get down?
[27:05.90]How do I get down?
[27:17.27]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[27:23.93]No fucking around.
[27:24.57]Wait, I'm gonna heal.
[27:25.67]I'll heal.
[27:30.34]This is funny.
[27:31.44]I like this game.
[27:33.54]I don't want to die, though.
[27:38.05]Nobody else?
[27:40.47]I love how I'm still in my hospital pajamas.
[27:44.54]Nothing over here.
[27:45.08]Are there any items that I can pick up in the trunk?
[27:47.24]Am I going to light on fire if I touch this?
[27:50.14]I think I will.
[27:51.42]I don't want to test it because I don't want to die.
[27:52.80]I'm not doing the joke to die.
[27:53.85]You know what I'm saying?
[27:58.09]I mean, sure it would be funny if I walked up to the car and oh, I only have 30 HP left and I got lit on fire and I died and we start the whole thing over.
[28:07.92]I got a lot of saliva in my mouth too, by the way.
[28:12.63]Stop sneaking around!
[28:14.87]I need healing!
[28:15.69]Wait, what's that?
[28:19.07]No, that's just a ladder.
[28:19.91]Okay.
[28:20.15]Alright, we're gonna hack this thing.
[28:24.10]Here we go!
[28:35.84]Stop doing that!
[28:36.66]Stop it!
[28:37.24]Why do I do that shit?
[28:42.33]Alright, I'm going to make a reference here.
[28:44.77]And I want to see if this is a correct reference.
[28:47.47]You know like MLB baseball, like MLB The Show.
[28:51.64]Or even like Ken Griffey, no we're going to do a Ken Griffey N64 baseball game reference here.
[28:57.48]You know when you have a player that has the giant circle and you're supposed to hit the ball, the ball has to go into the circle?
[29:03.45]I feel like that's what I'm using.
[29:05.99]And my player has such low power statistics that there's no way I'm going to hit this baseball.
[29:16.02]See, I'm like the eighth player.
[29:18.20]The eighth player.
[29:20.83]I have to go punch him.
[29:29.15]I can't shoot anybody.
[29:32.15]Yeah, I missed the ball.
[29:33.13]I struck out three times.
[29:37.03]I have to get this player.
[29:41.26]Any more hacking I can do?
[29:42.86]This is, like, actually good.
[29:44.41]What happened?
[29:44.93]Oh.
[29:45.41]Briefcase.
[29:51.09]2,500 bucks.
[29:51.67]Damn.
[29:55.95]Hack the computer.
[29:56.79]Sure thing.
[29:57.47]Another tutorial.
[29:59.40]Oh, man.
[30:02.76]Okay, yeah.
[30:03.42]This is one of those Facebook chain posts.
[30:08.76]What are the first three words that you see?
[30:12.34]Whatever they are, that describes your personality!
[30:15.17]Alright, let's see what they are.
[30:20.99]Let's see what my personality is.
[30:25.99]Match the top password with its twin.
[30:27.63]Lock in the left password.
[30:31.94]Oh, man.
[30:32.42]Okay.
[30:34.28]Okay.
[30:37.94]And then, if the security bars fill up, the sequence will move.
[30:40.64]Running out of time will trigger an alarm.
[30:42.58]So I gotta find the path.
[30:43.60]Alright, here we go.
[30:44.16]I'll be pretty good at this.
[30:46.62]Here we go.
[30:46.98]Start the hack.
[30:54.84]No, it's right there!
[30:55.40]4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4.
[30:57.36]Right there.
[30:57.80]No!
[30:57.92]Where is it?
[30:58.48]4.
[30:58.50]4.
[30:58.52]4!
[30:58.68]Where's the 4?
[30:58.98]Oh god!
[31:09.55]Hold on, I need to know what my profile says.
[31:12.33]D?
[31:13.59]Oh man, I'm not gonna be good at this.
[31:15.55]It's right here.
[31:16.09]There's this one.
[31:17.59]Where's this other one?
[31:21.98]There it is.
[31:24.02]What was my horoscope?
[31:31.76]It's just the one, it's whatever text is not moving.
[31:35.35]Easier said than done though.
[31:39.86]Don't what?
[31:44.02]Here we go.
[31:44.44]What is it?
[31:45.12]I wonder what that QR code is.
[31:50.93]That's enough.
[31:51.71]I think that's my line.
[31:53.67]The hell's going on?
[31:54.55]Why did you drug me?
[31:55.41]We need to get the location of this facility confidential.
[31:58.15]That was way too... Especially if you get kidnapped and questioned.
[32:02.71]Is it like three or four engines in this game like every game back in 2007?
[32:08.08]Are there one of two endings in this game that I'm doing all these question answers for no reason because I'm going to get one of the two endings?
[32:13.95]Yep.
[32:15.77]I'm going to ask you some questions, run you through some more tests, then you and I can talk face to face.
[32:21.61]I'm ready for this.
[32:24.57]No, but some morphine might.
[32:26.95]Whatever cocktail you shot into my system.
[32:28.94]What the hell was that?
[32:30.36]That's classified.
[32:32.04]Although I didn't expect you to shake it off so quickly.
[32:35.84]I've been rereading your dossier.
[32:40.09]Your file makes you seem more like a tourist than an agent.
[32:43.29]Are we gonna do another personality test?
[32:45.15]The stamps are just for show.
[32:46.71]I can't confirm or deny I was ever in any of those places.
[32:50.16]Nor were there any witnesses.
[32:51.84]Well, I hope you like going where it's hot.
[32:53.74]And I'm not talking about hell, but some place close to it.
[32:56.78]Look at the amount of money it takes for those TVs to be there.
[32:59.56]That is... Those are nine, like, 70-inch... No, that's like 12 70-inch TVs.
[33:10.46]What overkill?
[33:12.34]Why does he have to be across... Sarcastic.
[33:13.62]You could get this across by being on like a 16 to 17 inch TV.
[33:15.49]What a waste of money.
[33:17.09]There's 16 of them.
[33:35.99]I won't lie to you, Mike.
[33:37.93]It's a big one and dangerous.
[33:39.48]But I think you're the man for the job.
[33:41.72]See, this guy knows how many TVs he's on.
[33:45.82]And he knows how menacing that's going to look on 16 70-inch TVs.
[33:49.46]Alright, I leveled up.
[33:51.38]I can spin my EP real quiet.
[33:52.60]Alright, perks aggressive.
[34:02.37]Okay, that's kind of cool.
[34:03.97]You've shown your aggressive side in your earliest conversation, so we're going to be aggressive in every conversation.
[34:13.54]Damage sustained, pistol... Alright, this is cool.
[34:16.74]So what's the next thing for martial arts?
[34:18.76]I don't even have it unlocked yet.
[34:21.90]How many points do I have?
[34:23.70]Ten.
[34:23.92]Alright, let's take a little bit of a look here.
[34:27.41]Stealth is going to be a big deal.
[34:30.44]I have to do stealth.
[34:31.23]I'm going to do martial arts.
[34:36.15]QR code projection.
[34:37.19]Yeah, I already made the joke.
[34:38.99]Scan that.
[34:39.41]That's my Ethereum address.
[34:42.35]You want to send me some Ethereum?
[34:43.69]It's down there.
[34:46.46]That's right.
[34:47.10]Jerma now accepts Ether.
[34:50.76]Let's hope it doesn't crash down to like $500 again like it did last night.
[34:58.60]I'm doing stealth.
[35:04.12]No stealth?
[35:04.94]How am I supposed to hit anybody?
[35:15.40]Let me not be a total moron here.
[35:19.49]Let me just see.
[35:22.69]I like technical aptitude.
[35:27.17]Additional rounds.
[35:30.31]Quickly strip ammunition out of a gun's chamber.
[35:32.65]It's a faster reload.
[35:36.06]Cool down on first aid.
[35:37.64]Weapon balancing.
[35:40.26]Sabotage.
[35:43.84]Breaking and entering reduces the difficulty of lockpicking.
[35:46.56]Okay.
[35:47.68]Thank you.
[35:49.26]Yes, I want that to be a little easier.
[35:50.90]Why not?
[35:53.26]Toughness here.
[35:53.92]Let's do... Oh, I've got four more points.
[35:59.76]This requires three.
[36:06.56]Extra ammo to compensate for lack of aiming.
[36:11.14]Sabotage.
[36:11.94]When activated over a clock, enhances the effect of the next offensive gadget used.
[36:17.57]The effect radius as well as any applicable... Okay.
[36:21.61]Let's do toughness.
[36:23.83]I feel like I need to do at least one point here.
[36:27.89]Because medic basic I feel like is very important to have this.
[36:33.88]And he committed.
[36:35.38]Committed.
[36:37.29]Big ass screen.
[36:40.23]See, he got it half right there.
[36:46.01]Oh, wow.
[36:47.31]I really do love watching twitch.tv.
[36:50.68]These are all my favorite streams and my favorite streamers.
[36:54.10]See over there on the top left, somebody's playing Plague Inc.
[36:58.14]Oh, I love that game.
[37:00.08]Down here in the lower left, we've got a helicopter simulator.
[37:02.86]That's one of my favorite games to see streamed.
[37:06.69]Right there in the middle, I love Medical Simulator 2012.
[37:10.15]I love it.
[37:12.41]Oh, we've got HankyPanky21 is playing Metal Gear Solid here on the top screen.
[37:18.17]God, I love these guys.
[37:25.13]That was a good joke.
[37:25.91]Give me a break.
[37:31.58]No, no, that was a good joke.
[37:32.88]That was a good joke.
[37:34.40]And by the way, that shit's banned!
[37:40.36]Fucking dumb, stupid thing.
[37:43.18]Why would I have these here?
[37:44.84]I have two coffee lids.
[37:47.93]They're like Dunkin' Donuts lids, and they're different sizes.
[37:51.45]Why do I have these here?
[37:53.83]I need to show this on screen, because why the fuck do I have these sitting right here?
[37:58.67]What are these here for?
[37:59.89]Wait a second.
[38:01.29]This is really important.
[38:02.45]I don't care about the game right now.
[38:04.75]You need to see this.
[38:05.31]Okay, so explain to me why I have a medium, a medium and a large coffee lid.
[38:31.43]Here.
[38:33.59]There's nothing else on the desk.
[38:36.85]These are the only two things that are here.
[38:38.58]And obviously the coffee that I almost just like dumped on the ground.
[38:40.48]That's like right there.
[38:42.94]I don't get it.
[38:45.10]I don't know what kind of like drugs I'm taking and I don't know.
[38:48.98]No, I gotta save these two coffee lids.
[38:53.32]I don't take drugs.
[38:54.12]That was a fucking fake drug joke.
[38:56.99]Give it a rest.
[39:02.05]Two... Those aren't Dunkachinos.
[39:03.65]Those are iced coffees.
[39:05.17]Oh, what a weirdo.
[39:08.21]LOL.
[39:08.69]No, that's not... Look, I'm not trying to do that.
[39:11.23]I'm not... Oh, my goddammit.
[39:12.67]Let's go back and play... Amazing.

[39:38.92]What a random... The way he's looking at me, he's like, holy shit man, those are really cool moves.
[39:49.18]Yep, okay.
[39:50.22]I'm gonna let you tire yourself out here.
[39:51.86]It's like watching a dog.
[39:58.64]How do I give him my weapons?
[40:04.50]Did he take my weapon?
[40:06.30]He didn't even look.
[40:09.04]Hey, there's no weapons beyond this point.
[40:11.28]We use the honor system here.
[40:13.42]So, just go ahead.
[40:15.52]Hope you don't have anything.
[40:16.36]Wasn't I just fighting these guys?
[40:31.09]I don't know.
[40:31.57]I'm confused.
[40:32.69]I was just murdering these people.
[40:39.48]Okay.
[40:43.02]I wonder if he's going to go to school.
[40:45.86]No, he's going to military base.

[43:23.68]I'm gonna hack this guy's computer in front of him.
[43:25.64]Easy.
[43:26.68]Okay, here we go.
[43:29.34]Six, five.
[43:31.26]There it is.
[43:33.06]Dude, it's actually hard to move this all the way over here.
[43:35.28]Go, go, go!
[43:37.10]Eight, five.
[43:38.74]There it is.
[43:43.66]Fuck you.
[43:44.80]Where is it?
[43:45.68]Oh, they updated it on me.
[43:46.74]Oh, shit.
[43:47.32]They fucking updated it.
[43:48.54]There it is.
[43:50.48]Ah!
[44:00.19]Well, I don't think there's any problem.
[44:01.37]Let's do it again.
[44:03.75]What great security you have here.
[44:06.83]2C.
[44:10.79]Oh, it's so annoying to bring this all the way down here.
[44:14.05]4E.
[44:19.46]Come on.
[44:19.88]There it is.
[44:22.52]Alright, let's look at the emails.
[44:28.20]Uh...
[44:29.69]Alright, so this is an email from that streamer that's gonna get banned, and he's like, he's trying to appeal his ban to like Twitch staff.
[44:39.07]Wait, is this like, are we just at twitch.tv?
[44:41.79]Am I like a twitch.tv partner manager?
[44:46.71]I don't know who cares about this.
[44:51.41]This is just lore.
[44:52.65]Hack for lore.
[45:05.21]It's just lore.
[45:06.23]Cool.
[45:08.29]Hilarious jokes.
[45:16.08]Come on!
[45:17.08]Just because the jokes suck doesn't mean you have to... Just give me a fucking sympathy laugh, please!
[45:23.21]Hello?
[45:24.31]Anybody shooting in here?
[45:27.11]See?
[45:27.35]They're like shooting a live broadcast.
[45:30.27]Hey.
[45:31.31]Hey, you're the one I spoke to when I woke up in the medical bay.
[45:35.45]I'm glad that wasn't a hallucination.
[45:37.45]It may have been.
[45:39.07]Do you remember my name?
[45:40.61]Or do I need to write it down for you?
[45:42.03]I got it.
[45:44.32]Mina, right?
[45:45.28]I remember names.
[45:45.94]I'll go with that.
[45:46.50]Good to see you've recovered from the medical room with your memory intact.
[45:49.48]Memory intact?
[45:51.12]Speaking of which, I don't remember where I left my keys or my passport.
[45:54.66]Confiscating personal items is quite routine.
[45:57.00]I wouldn't worry about that.
[45:58.54]I'm like every tattoo artist you've ever seen.
[46:00.88]I'm here to run you through the weapons training and test your accuracy.
[46:04.35]I already know how to use firearms.
[46:05.95]Can we just get to the range?
[46:07.41]I want to get through this and get to the real assignment.
[46:09.49]I need aggressive.
[46:11.00]Be my guest.
[46:13.16]Just head through the door to the firing range, and I'll keep in contact with you over the earpiece.
[46:17.44]Head over to the table, get your weapons, and we can begin.
[46:23.00]The standard field agent package includes a pistol, SMG, shotgun, and assault rifle.
[46:27.44]I hate this.
[46:28.04]Each has its strengths and weaknesses.
[46:30.10]I don't want to be this guy.
[46:31.74]Let's start with the pistol.
[46:34.28]I know how to use guns.
[46:36.92]Equip the pistol.
[46:38.16]Then aim down range and take some shots.
[46:40.00]Alright, I have a pistol equipped.
[46:42.30]Target.
[46:45.86]I can't, like, attack him from the... Alright, here we go.
[46:47.78]Pistol training.
[46:53.02]Okay, the changes in size, the smaller the recticule, the more accurate.
[46:56.55]Of course it will.
[46:57.15]Bingo.
[46:59.79]This just takes a long time.
[47:04.85]Thank you.
[47:05.39]Okay, I understand.
[47:06.03]So, like, I can't shoot this gun unless I do this.
[47:08.29]It's pretty much happening.
[47:09.91]See, I don't have to worry about this.
[47:23.42]This is just pray and spread.
[47:24.63]Now let's empty the clip.
[47:26.15]Let you get a feel for the recoil.
[47:27.89]Target changes size as you move and aim the small... Okay.
[47:31.67]What the hell?
[47:32.15]Why am I holding it like this?
[47:33.01]Look at this spread.
[47:41.15]That is insane spread.
[47:46.57]I'll be lucky to hit anybody.
[47:48.36]Still using cover.
[47:49.52]Take some shots at the target.
[47:50.80]Oh no.
[47:56.40]Yeah, my accuracy is terrible in general too.
[47:58.54]I might as well just do this.
[48:02.10]Now try popping out and focusing your aim.
[48:04.20]You can use cover to your advantage here.
[48:10.04]There's no reason for me to aim with an actual targeter.
[48:14.43]I've unlocked the door to the tactical range on your right.
[48:17.89]Let's see how you do against some moving targets.
[48:24.49]Alright.
[48:25.69]Stand up.
[48:27.21]Pick up the weapon.
[48:30.40]Can I lose the tutorial?
[48:31.72]That was actually pretty good.
[48:38.08]We got moving.
[48:38.66]Oh no!
[48:39.00]Shit!
[48:42.10]I missed completely and the terrible spread hit him in the head.
[48:46.44]That's it.
[48:48.80]That was the whole challenge.
[48:52.23]Okay.
[48:52.85]No, no.
[48:53.13]I'm going to be moving around.
[48:58.30]I have to make it through the challenge.
[49:03.38]RNG.
[49:04.60]There we go.
[49:05.22]This is what I'm talking about.
[49:06.16]Shotgun, baby.
[49:09.95]This is very far away to shoot this.
[49:12.17]Shit.
[49:12.37]God damn it.
[49:12.69]Good.
[49:12.97]Next.
[49:31.53]Hold down the button and... What if I just shoot the gun?
[49:38.48]Alright, I'm not even going to aim anymore.
[49:40.10]Who cares?
[49:40.48]Damage multiplier for protective hits.
[49:42.34]That's cool.
[49:42.72]Me and this are going to get along very, very well.
[49:58.39]Shotgun or submachine gun are really the only ones I can use.
[50:01.09]I cannot use the pistol.
[50:01.99]It's not going to work.
[50:05.41]I guess I'll put a point into shotguns, maybe?
[50:06.77]Look at that.
[50:08.53]I'm going to strike out here.
[50:10.19]Holy shit.
[50:10.53]Oh, man.
[50:10.89]Oh, I would fail this field test.
[50:29.73]Just stand still there for me, enemy.
[50:35.37]Thank you.
[50:35.73]Do I get to keep these?
[50:41.10]Or do you not get to keep these?
[50:49.91]Can you please change his appearance?
[50:51.75]This guy makes me so fucking mad.
[50:57.20]Well, now he has to stay like this for at least the first mission.
[51:01.14]Look, how about this?
[51:01.60]We'll change our personality type based on the character that we look like.
[51:05.24]This guy's gonna be aggressive and mean.
[51:07.86]And then we'll make a very kind, gentle-looking man.
[51:11.38]And he'll be nice.
[51:17.18]Good, Mike.
[51:17.98]I'm logging the results now.
[51:20.00]Alright.
[51:20.38]I thought that was my stomach growling.
[51:23.78]Darcy, he's trying to beat your time.
[51:26.70]That was an I'm hungry stomach growl.
[51:28.02]Darcy, who the hell is that?
[51:29.85]Our tech instructor.
[51:31.87]Very insecure.
[51:33.89]Good luck.
[51:34.45]He can try.
[51:35.15]Aggressive.
[51:35.59]Oh, he will.
[51:37.75]Repeatedly.
[51:38.27]Does he not know when to quit?
[51:40.91]As soon as he knew you were talking to me, Mike, he was in here in a second.
[51:44.71]In case he saw you as a challenge for my...
[51:47.17]Affections.
[51:48.91]It's like a cage match with you boys.
[51:50.95]Aggressive.
[51:52.05]How's he doing?
[51:52.65]I don't want him beating my time.
[51:54.65]It's not bad.
[51:55.89]Close.
[51:56.77]But it won't beat yours.
[51:58.25]Why don't you guys take lunch here?
[51:59.27]Alright.
[52:00.15]Let's see here.
[52:04.35]Okay.
[52:05.27]Misses. 37.
[52:09.73]So time taken, 134, so 37 misses, 22 hits, 11... Alright, so that's negative.
[52:21.29]That is a negative score for hits versus misses.
[52:27.09]But at least I took, I got a good time.
[52:30.42]I think you might still be feeling the effects of the drugs.
[52:33.29]It's definitely affecting your aim.
[52:34.23]Why didn't you show the amount of karate chops that I landed?
[52:36.03]You can give it another run if you want.
[52:37.69]No.
[52:38.13]The course should be free.
[52:39.07]I do not want to do that again.
[52:40.91]Eh, I'll pass.
[52:42.31]Very well.
[52:42.99]I'll log your score.
[52:44.45]I'll have the results sent to your handout.
[52:45.69]Oh, shit.
[52:46.39]And Westridge can give the rest of your evaluation, provided you completed the other tests.
[52:49.53]Oh, no.
[52:49.71]He's going to get that test?
[52:51.01]That was actually being graded?
[52:52.43]I thought that was just a dumb tutorial.
[52:55.70]Ugh.
[52:59.22]Alright, we already hacked that.
[53:01.34]Wait, what is this?
[53:02.00]No.
[53:02.50]I don't want to do that again.
[53:06.80]Interrogation room.
[53:08.54]AP classes.
[53:09.50]Yeah, I'm not ready for AP.
[53:11.50]I need to do college prep only.
[53:13.62]That was my downfall.
[53:19.33]Alright, we gotta... Oh, okay.
[53:22.88]Now we're going to get interrogated.
[53:23.96]The professor's going to be really mad at us.
[53:26.18]You guys must have spent a fortune on the TVs in this place.
[53:29.58]You all done?
[53:30.20]As much as I thought was necessary.
[53:33.60]Good.
[53:34.20]I have to admit, I was worried whether we'd be able to keep you here after you woke up in medical.
[53:39.07]You gave our staff a run for its money.
[53:41.69]Maybe it's their training that's in question, not mine.
[53:45.45]Fair enough.
[53:46.61]It'll be a good excuse to up the morning drills around here.
[53:50.41]Mina's report says you might need more practice on the gun range, but you're probably still shaking off the drugs we gave you.
[53:56.34]No, confident.
[53:57.00]I'll do better next time, believe it.
[53:58.86]Presuming you don't dope me up before the next test.
[54:01.26]I promise not to drug you unless you get too full of yourself, and we need to bring you back to the level of normal folks.
[54:07.47]Might be time to look at different employment when your employer says, in quotes, I promise not to drug you this time.
[54:14.33]Not everyone gets chosen for this line of work, but you volunteered.
[54:18.47]Usually we have to ask.
[54:20.20]You ever had an intern position at a government agency?
[54:22.95]I have.
[54:24.25]Need I say more?
[54:25.43]All my exercise was moving papers from desk to desk.
[54:29.23]I'm here to do work, not sit back and manage it.
[54:31.82]I want to be out where the action is.
[54:33.32]I want to make a difference.
[54:34.92]What makes you think you're ready?
[54:37.03]There we go.
[54:38.01]The faster you press the button, the more aggressive it is.
[54:41.25]Eventually, you grab him by the neck and scream in his face.
[54:42.99]Here comes the personnel.
[54:43.85]Go.
[55:05.82]That's what we're going to discuss now.
[55:07.52]Got to make a joke here.
[55:08.14]Are you suggesting I have an attitude problem?
[55:11.17]No, believe it or not, you're not here because you're a people person.
[55:14.63]You're here because your site profile says you're skilled at manipulating others.
[55:18.41]Was that a compliment?
[55:19.95]You'll see.
[55:20.81]The way you project yourself definitely affects what people think of you and your reputation with them.
[55:26.23]What do I care what others think?
[55:27.53]So please choose the answer here that's going to give you a minus one or a plus one to me.
[55:33.68]Sometimes you want to piss someone off so they can't think straight.
[55:37.12]Other times you want to build a strong rapport with someone and talk your way out of a bad situation.
[55:42.26]All depends on your objective.
[55:44.14]This goes for your handlers as well.
[55:46.30]We're going to be sending you into a lot of dangerous places and your only backup is going to be who you're talking to on your headset.
[55:53.13]Oh, we're gonna have moody people on the headset.
[55:54.31]This is a long way of telling me that I should just act the way I want.
[56:09.82]I don't have time to chat when there's work to be done.
[56:11.84]It sounds like it'll just leave me vulnerable.
[56:13.48]Don't let anybody like you, but don't let anybody hate you either.
[56:15.94]No, again, there are no bad choices, just results.
[56:19.78]Over time, folks may hear about you and your attitude before they meet you.
[56:24.28]They may have a preconceived notion of how you're going to treat them, which can affect their reaction.
[56:28.90]Well, maybe they should take the time to know the real thing.
[56:30.86]What's going on in chat right now?
[56:32.81]Time something no one seems to be able to spare.
[56:34.99]Are people using illegal memes?
[56:37.65]Although that can be a plus.
[56:39.93]I don't see how.
[56:42.07]Yeah.
[56:42.63]The clock doesn't stop when you're speaking to someone.
[56:44.59]Endurance recharges.
[56:45.23]So if you need to get your second wind before a fight, making small talk can buy you time.
[56:49.68]But if I'm running on adrenaline, won't chatting take me off my guard?
[56:53.22]It can.
[56:53.64]But if you need to get to the point, act instead of fight.
[56:56.78]For example, if you don't think I have any more to teach you, then you could just say, I'm done with this.
[57:02.69]I wouldn't think any less of you.
[57:04.93]Well, then I already do.
[57:06.51]I'm done with this.
[57:07.13]I'd rather skip the pep talk and get started.
[57:09.45]Fair enough.
[57:10.71]Meet me in the command center, and I can give you a proper mission briefing.
[57:14.27]Good.
[57:14.51]Here we go.
[57:14.89]Mission time.
[57:15.29]Because I'm sick of this room.
[57:17.10]Trust me, Mike.
[57:18.26]If it was up to me, you'd never see this interrogation cell again.
[57:22.06]Does that mean he would kill me?
[57:23.98]That's kind of a passive-aggressive way to tell me that.
[57:30.14]Alright.
[57:30.46]Mission time.
[57:32.86]Recognize him?
[57:34.68]That's Sheikh Ali Shahid, the voice of Al Samad.
[57:39.18]They say he was responsible for shooting down that airliner in the Middle East.
[57:42.98]Yeah, he got his hands on some prototype Halbeck technology.
[57:46.84]A missile with a multi-stage targeting system called Jacob's Ladder.
[57:50.50]That airliner was his first target.
[57:51.66]He's teaching me how to talk to people, yeah.
[57:53.06]Halbeck?
[57:54.33]I've run across them while I was touring the world.
[57:56.11]They don't exactly keep their hands clean.
[57:58.72]How did Shahid get his hands on that missile?
[58:01.06]Missiles?
[58:02.14]He's got more.
[58:03.34]He stole them from Halbeck, and we need them back before he gets any more.
[58:06.58]Eager.
[58:07.90]Then we want you to kill him.
[58:09.12]Come on, come on, come on.
[58:10.12]Let me in there, let me in there, let me in there.
[58:12.34]Alright, then.
[58:13.00]Pack your gear.
[58:14.18]You're heading to Saudi Arabia.
[58:15.52]You're not coming with me?
[58:16.88]I'll be there in spirit.
[58:18.50]And on video and radio when needed, agent.
[58:21.32]And I just got here.
[58:22.42]Oh, well.
[58:24.03]I'm going to miss this place.
[58:26.70]I doubt it.
[58:27.66]I'll contact you when you reach Saudi Arabia.
[58:30.66]I'm looking forward to a mission.
[58:37.07]So what is this?
[58:38.95]Alright.
[58:40.29]After awakening in a medical facility... No, this is just telling me what I did.
[58:44.88]Hands.
[58:46.60]Okay, so I got 2,500 bucks.
[58:49.92]What do you spend money on?
[58:55.95]Care to explain how Halbeck lost its missiles?
[58:59.61]What?
[58:59.81]Old news.
[59:01.17]An accounting error.
[59:04.34]The missiles.
[59:06.16]You didn't lose them, did you?
[59:09.54]Why am I in different clothes?
[59:11.40]Because of what happened in Saudi Arabia.
[59:14.22]Oh, he's bringing back memories.
[59:15.44]We're going to play through a memory.
[59:21.41]What was that?
[59:21.77]Mike, can you read me?
[59:22.45]What the fuck is going on?
[59:23.13]I'm getting lots of interference.
[59:26.04]I think I can figure things out from here.
[59:27.54]Oh, shit.
[59:28.11]Okay, yeah.
[59:28.73]Sir.
[59:29.39]What?
[59:30.11]Wait.
[59:31.37]Okay.
[59:32.75]Alright, that's how you skip conversations in this game.
[59:37.18]Alright, where, can I turn, wait.
[59:39.36]Shit, I don't even know the mission.
[59:47.28]Alright, let's just go.
[59:49.04]I don't know what the mission is though.
[59:50.24]Do I have like an indicator?
[59:51.22]Did I turn off my where's the mission indicator hud on the, oh God.
[59:54.93]No, it's right here.
[60:00.03]Email, clearing house.
[60:03.48]That just showed my IP address on stream.
[60:05.66]Great.
[60:06.66]Okay, here we go.
[60:08.76]Don't need to worry about any of these things.
[60:10.22]What about gear?
[60:12.76]What do I have for money?
[60:13.46]I got 7,500 bucks.
[60:16.00]Shock pads.
[60:17.68]No.
[60:18.92]Where is the punch gloves?
[60:21.46]Ammo punch.
[60:22.32]No, that's an OU.
[60:29.09]There's nothing for my hand-to-hand?
[60:33.05]Explosive.
[60:42.05]Okay.
[60:42.63]I saw a grenade and I knee-jerk reaction did that.
[60:49.57]That was probably dumb.
[60:50.41]That was really dumb, I think.
[60:53.87]Alright, we're good.
[60:57.45]Increases endurance, reduces stealth.
[61:05.20]I don't need any of this shit right now, I don't think.
[61:08.44]Let's just do the mission.
[61:09.20]I don't have anything.
[61:11.04]I need a gun.
[61:11.80]Oh, fuck, I need a gun.
[61:12.74]No, I don't.
[61:18.23]That's fine.
[61:19.45]I can just walk around.
[61:20.15]This is just going to be a martial arts movie.
[61:22.95]Martial artists never use guns or anything.
[61:26.72]Does Jackie Chan shoot a gun?
[61:28.82]No.
[61:29.64]But Jackie Chan goes up against hundreds, if not thousands of people with machine guns.
[61:34.47]Just think like Jackie Chan.
[61:35.67]You'll be fine.
[61:36.15]Okay.
[61:38.13]Bug Al-Samad Airfield.
[61:41.43]Investigate Jizan weapons stockpile.
[61:43.93]Intercept the arms dealer.
[61:47.01]Let's intercept this guy.
[61:49.13]Intercept the arms dealer.
[61:50.43]Question Nasri about the stolen Halbek missiles.
[61:55.16]Reputation, he doesn't like me.
[61:58.08]Handler.
[61:59.90]Loose Cannon.
[62:00.54]Favored weapon damage plus one.
[62:01.86]The stolen missiles have been tracked to a black market arms dealer.
[62:06.18]He has set up camp in an abandoned palace outside Zalim.
[62:09.05]Break into Nasri's compound and find out everything he knows about the Halbek missiles.
[62:17.73]Here we go.
[62:22.42]Here we are.
[62:23.56]Sneak in here.
[62:24.98]Interrogate.
[62:29.11]I'm just driving in the front door.
[62:30.69]That was odd.
[62:31.07]I'm going to play a ton of games.
[62:33.75]Alright, no, no, no.
[62:34.31]We got... Oh, Jesus!
[62:34.85]I missed!
[62:56.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[62:57.89]Wait a minute.
[62:58.41]Wait.
[63:01.60]I didn't go by Master Jackie Chan's guidance.
[63:03.90]Oh, I'm getting my ass kicked.
[63:12.40]No, no, no.
[63:12.74]Restart the mission.
[63:16.49]There's no more bullets in that gun.
[63:17.95]Alright, we're good.
[63:24.45]No, I...
[63:27.72]No, no, we're doing this the right way.
[63:33.44]Let's do this the right way.
[63:37.49]Wait!
[63:40.67]What's happening?
[63:41.65]I can't redo the choice?
[63:43.77]Oh god, they're throwing grenades.
[63:47.05]How do I throw a grenade?
[63:48.26]I wanna throw a grenade too.
[63:50.98]You wanna play grenade with grenade?
[63:52.14]How do I throw grenades?
[63:53.44]Alright, I think this is good, right?
[63:55.10]That guy.
[63:59.03]Got him.
[64:09.45]What do you do in this situation?
[64:23.93]Oh god damn it.
[64:26.09]Why did I do this shit?
[64:34.26]We're going all the way back.
[64:38.44]I'm not gonna fucking just be a total dickhead about this.
[64:42.51]I want to do this right the way that I would do it if I was like part of the publisher's clearing house when that's what it said clear alright we're good just go let's do it we're gonna send what do you mean no redo is what I didn't know that that was gonna happen now I do so now we can I have the knowledge that I'm not gonna do that again clean intercept the dealer let's go
[65:10.95]Here we go.
[65:12.23]I'm gonna play this cool.
[65:13.33]We're not gonna do aggressive bullshit.
[65:14.89]I'm gonna sweet talk my way into the mansion.
[65:18.93]Careful, Mike.
[65:20.17]Don't play games with these guys.
[65:22.30]If I can get in without a firefight, that makes getting to Nasri that much easier.
[65:26.60]Follow Jackie Chan.
[65:28.00]Like a joke?
[65:28.48]American.
[65:29.18]Alleviate the situation.
[65:30.34]Nasri said nothing about an American.
[65:32.80]Canadian, actually.
[65:33.90]Have you gone?
[65:34.26]But I won't hold that against you.
[65:35.88]He's gonna be like, What is your business here, Canadian?
[65:39.16]Christmas trees.
[65:40.88]Come on.
[65:41.70]You know what I'm here for.
[65:42.97]I call Nasri.
[65:44.57]Check on you.
[65:45.61]Why is that guy doing the Christian Bale Batman?
[65:48.39]You need to take him out before he gets to the radio.
[65:50.59]What?
[65:54.79]Okay.
[65:55.27]So, wait.
[65:55.91]I haven't made a move yet.
[66:03.87]Wait.
[66:04.67]What?
[66:08.50]It don't matter.
[66:09.08]All choices don't matter.
[66:11.08]Wait, I gotta turn off the alarm.
[66:17.78]Oh, shit!
[66:25.09]My bullshit was ineffective.
[66:26.39]Let me turn the alarm off.
[66:27.61]Okay, one.
[66:35.15]Got it.
[66:38.50]So is there anything else I can do here?
[66:41.76]I don't want to miss anything.
[66:42.81]Let me check upstairs.
[66:50.07]No, nothing.
[66:51.75]Okay.
[66:52.95]I can't... I don't want to use the gun unless I have to.
[66:57.44]How do you just fast travel down?
[66:59.38]What's the sprint button?
[67:00.62]These are things I need to know.
[67:04.00]That's not sprint.
[67:05.24]That's not sprint.
[67:06.66]That's crouch.
[67:08.61]Okay, holding A is sprint.
[67:12.82]Oh, should I just use a goddamn perk?
[67:16.24]How do I get in?
[67:20.26]Around here?
[67:22.36]I do have to go this way.
[67:23.96]Do I?
[67:29.55]Jump across.
[67:31.85]There we go.
[67:32.57]Alright, let's be cautious here.
[67:34.13]I want a good stealth score.
[67:36.78]No fucking around.
[67:37.50]I'm a martial QCQ artist.
[67:47.18]That's... That's... Quality... That's quality combat.
[67:54.34]Quintessential.
[67:54.92]That's quintessential quality combat.
[68:05.12]Quintessential combat quality.
[68:07.37]Thank you.
[68:21.37]Quintessential quality combat.
[68:24.87]Alright, it's hard for me to talk sometimes.
[68:26.45]Let's check the radar.
[68:27.17]Alright, we got a guy up here.
[68:29.75]Nobody over this way.
[68:30.59]We're gonna sneak over here.
[68:33.17]And, uh, grenade out!
[68:34.31]No, just kidding.
[68:34.81]I'm not gonna throw a fucking grenade.
[68:37.45]Is there a whistle?
[68:38.89]Wait, hide in the dumpster.
[68:39.85]Can I hide in the dumpster?
[68:40.57]No, no, no.
[68:40.77]How am I gonna... Ah, wait.
[68:41.93]I gotta think of something here.
[68:44.63]How... Shit.
[68:46.35]I think I can... He's just right here.
[68:51.23]Where's the other guy?
[68:54.85]Is this bullets or are these tranquilizers?
[68:59.85]Pistol ammo.
[69:00.87]Hold on.
[69:02.55]Wait, I want... No, I want tranquilizers.
[69:09.08]Explode.
[69:09.46]No.
[69:09.80]You idiot.
[69:11.08]No, you idiot.
[69:13.22]I don't think I have any.
[69:21.41]Anybody hide over there?
[69:22.25]Alright, here we go.
[69:25.79]Some quintessential...
[69:29.43]There it is.
[69:38.90]Guards are all dead.
[69:42.86]Reload this and infiltrate the palace.
[69:48.58]No breaking doors.
[69:49.38]I don't want to alert any guards.
[69:53.63]Anything to hack?
[69:55.59]Doesn't look like it.
[69:57.61]Nazra's headquarters are in an old palace up the hill.
[70:00.15]That's your target.
[70:01.21]Nice, okay.
[70:02.79]Oh, don't do that.
[70:05.75]I'm so used to doing that in Resident Evil 5 that I have to do it.
[70:09.22]It's been quiet since the airliner.
[70:11.22]I would have expected more to have happened.
[70:13.62]The airliner was enough, and we have the Hellback missiles for that.
[70:16.82]Do not be too eager.
[70:21.52]Ah!
[70:30.71]I don't think, it doesn't matter.
[70:31.77]Oh no!
[70:40.60]Shit.
[70:41.20]I gotta be careful here.
[70:45.81]Time for some quintessential quality combat control!
[70:59.28]Okay, I don't think he can go over here.
[71:01.62]No, he's not gonna hit me.
[71:03.02]So I need to think this through.
[71:03.95]I need to think this through.
[71:05.71]God dammit!
[71:10.89]God dammit!
[71:20.76]What a fucking wreck.
[71:22.86]What a total wreck.
[71:26.72]I don't even do QCQC.
[71:31.61]I might as well just put points into fucking grenade tactician.
[71:37.83]Where's the goddamn thing?
[71:39.53]I gotta stop joking around.
[71:42.51]I'm playing this really jokey, and I shouldn't be doing that.
[71:49.15]Can I put something in the microwave?
[71:50.69]No, there it is.
[71:51.09]Alright, we gotta hack this.
[72:00.79]Yeah, we're fine.
[72:05.80]No more jokey shit.
[72:07.12]Maybe one more.
[72:08.10]I have one more jokey grenade that I can throw.
[72:12.44]You have to remember something, guys.
[72:13.86]Okay?
[72:15.61]Remember.
[72:17.26]If a game has a car you can drive, it's automatically fun.
[72:21.04]If a game has grenades you can throw, it's automatically fun.
[72:24.50]You're not going to give me the car equivalent of a third person shooter, which is the grenade.
[72:30.37]It just is.
[72:31.49]So I'm sorry.
[72:32.15]Nothing out the window.
[72:43.16]Is anybody down there actually?
[72:44.08]No.
[72:50.86]That just... That just hurt my body.
[72:54.16]Aye-yi-yi.
[72:54.82]I was gonna say, that's pressure sensitive.
[73:06.61]Nothing... Wait, I did... Didn't I just do this?
[73:12.23]What the hell?
[73:12.65]Why did I go all the way around?
[73:15.11]I just unlocked a Dark Souls shortcut.
[73:21.11]That didn't do anything for me.
[73:22.83]What the fuck is that for?
[73:23.65]I just went in a total circle.
[73:28.95]I wanna go that way!
[73:33.92]What?
[73:41.36]I went in- I just- I just went in a circle again.
[73:46.61]Okay, I might have to go the other way.
[73:49.77]Maybe not go up the stairs or something?
[73:53.59]Oh.
[73:53.71]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[73:59.06]There could be some bad actors here.
[74:02.12]Checkpoint.
[74:02.82]Got it.
[74:03.50]Good.
[74:05.96]Alright, we only have one funny grenade opportunity.
[74:08.32]We gotta make sure we use it in the right spot.
[74:13.72]And I ain't gonna blow that.
[74:18.04]One shot.
[74:18.54]Wait, oh shit.
[74:21.10]That guy heard me.
[74:30.14]Can I drag bodies?
[74:31.79]No, you can't.
[74:40.03]Shit.
[74:43.93]Wait till he turns.
[74:44.45]He's not gonna see him.
[74:45.11]Do they see dead bodies?
[74:52.98]No, don't like just diagonally come over here.
[74:56.74]Should I funny grenade this guy?
[74:59.54]No, that's not a funny grenade opportunity.
[75:01.30]We're gonna go up.
[75:06.99]Who heard that?
[75:08.47]I thought that piece of paper was a person.
[75:11.07]Oh, you got scared.
[75:14.57]What?
[75:16.54]Where'd the guy go?
[75:19.24]I think the guy woke up and sounded the alarm.
[75:21.97]Oh, no, it was you!
[75:26.08]I'm not gonna hit this guy.
[75:26.88]I need to wait till he... Got him.
[75:35.94]Just pick the fucking block.
[75:48.65]I'm under a lot of pressure right now.
[75:53.50]I'm in.
[75:53.74]Can I close the door?
[76:00.53]Oh, she!
[76:01.13]Nice.
[76:04.95]Good roundhouse.
[76:07.89]Sneak.
[76:08.45]Good sneaking skills.
[76:18.87]Red barrel.
[76:20.61]Perfect.
[76:23.43]We got a red barrel opportunity here with a guy that has no idea what he's doing.
[76:42.58]Oh my god.
[76:50.30]Trooper.
[76:52.24]Oh, no, no.
[76:53.26]Not another grenade.
[76:56.04]Can I make you throw that grenade at yourself?
[77:01.19]Throw a grenade over here.
[77:06.95]Crack the safe.
[77:07.71]Now's not the time to crack the safe.
[77:17.72]Wait until he comes up the stairs.
[77:26.67]You don't think I have the aim?
[77:27.53]I can get lucky, like anybody else can.
[77:41.18]It's just free target practice.
[77:43.40]I got him in the hand.
[77:44.92]No, that went over his head.
[77:46.18]No, that went to the left.
[77:47.14]He's just like, I'm gonna just gently turn into an animated gif.
[78:01.22]Whatever.
[78:01.68]Let's go.
[78:02.14]I just have to go, like, strangle the prince or whatever.
[78:12.59]Dead.
[78:13.89]That was a good stealth kill.
[78:17.80]Somebody come up the stairs.
[78:19.66]Oh, shit.
[78:20.08]He's right here.
[78:21.02]He can't see me.
[78:21.38]He doesn't know where I am.
[78:22.10]Good.
[78:33.63]That guy baited me out.
[78:36.37]So bad.
[78:36.83]I think that's good.
[78:41.22]Where's the alarm that's ringing?
[78:43.82]Somebody turn off that telephone.
[78:47.96]Duffel bag had 4,500 bucks in it.
[78:50.28]We got... That's how you get Darth Vader'd.
[78:57.50]I'll just use the Force on this motherfucker.
[79:12.25]What's in the safe?
[79:13.83]I'm getting a lot of money.
[79:18.79]Okay, I need to turn off this alarm.
[79:22.57]This alarm has to go.
[79:23.79]I don't even know where it is.
[79:26.25]It could... Oh, shut up.
[79:36.07]Finally.
[79:37.55]Now I can, at my leisure, go to the prince.
[79:42.40]We go up here.
[79:47.80]Let's turn on the debugging unit.
[79:51.08]There are no living organisms inside of this building here.
[79:55.59]There's a guy up there.
[79:56.39]Sneak in there, and I'm gonna... There's nobody in here, so who cares?
[80:00.31]Just go.
[80:02.75]Any ammo?
[80:03.29]Any money?
[80:06.11]The missions are timed, too, aren't they?
[80:07.74]Not timed, per se.
[80:10.29]But if you complete a mission in a small amount of time, you get benefits.
[80:17.43]I think.
[80:19.72]Alright, here we are.
[80:23.76]We're at the checkpoint.
[80:26.70]Let's play this intelligently.
[80:30.98]Guy over there.
[80:33.09]Do I have anything else?
[80:33.95]Okay.
[80:35.01]Alright, here we go.
[80:36.27]We're gonna do a test here.
[80:46.41]Let me see if I can get this to play out here.
[80:48.53]Where is he?
[80:49.63]Is he over there?
[80:51.49]Shit, how do I put this down?
[80:53.45]Can I put the grenade down?
[80:55.95]I can throw this really far.
[80:57.21]I wanted to put it down.
[80:58.75]I just want to see how far I can throw.
[81:15.49]It's alright.
[81:15.83]In a minute, they'll forget about me.
[81:23.86]That was heavy weapons, guy.
[81:26.06]It kind of was.
[81:29.32]Once this guy goes back to normal, then I'm just going to sneak down there.
[81:34.88]I think they're alright now.
[81:35.60]I just don't want to be seen.
[81:39.77]That noise every time is so horrible sounding.
[81:43.33]Is there an alternative way to go here?
[81:46.20]Can I jump on the rooftops?
[81:52.36]I ultimately need to go up there.
[81:53.90]So if I just wrap around... There's stuff on the table.
[81:58.18]I think there's money on the table.
[82:01.40]What was that?
[82:01.80]Are you kidding me?
[82:07.81]I was just pretending to not know where I was.
[82:11.39]Why did I...
[82:14.59]Run.
[82:16.01]No, don't fucking punch.
[82:22.75]Just give me the money.
[82:26.62]There's no money there.
[82:27.32]There's no money.
[82:27.90]Just go up, up, up, up, up.
[82:31.86]Somebody has a fucking machine gun.
[82:36.10]Okay, made it.
[82:37.98]Now it's just a question of will they come to me.
[82:49.47]I don't want to open the door.
[82:50.47]If I open the door, the alarm is still going.
[82:52.51]No, I have to get it.
[83:04.48]Car.
[83:05.10]Shoot the car.
[83:05.54]I can't even hit the car.
[83:09.29]Go in the door.
[83:09.85]We're going in here.
[83:12.66]Hot as in temperature or hot as in... there are lots of people that are gonna try to get me.
[83:24.06]Time to find him.
[83:30.87]Alright, we got a door here I can open.
[83:32.31]I can pick this lock.
[83:33.17]Anything in the... lockers or anything?
[83:45.65]Goddammit.
[83:46.67]Holy shit.
[83:47.05]I was about to be so angry.
[83:50.69]Get intel.
[83:54.13]Briefcase.
[83:54.57]No, it's just a bunch of money.
[83:55.35]Okay, cool.
[83:58.91]The alarm is still sounding.
[84:02.56]So there is that.
[84:03.34]Should I go up?
[84:12.13]What is this?
[84:14.61]Oh shit.
[84:16.27]Wait, what?
[84:23.87]Really?
[84:24.27]Yeah?
[84:25.88]You were just waiting for the door to open?
[84:28.38]Is that what this is?
[84:30.26]Okay.
[84:31.68]Nice work.
[84:47.04]fucking serious.
[84:47.92]Give me a break.
[84:51.36]I need to turn off the alarm.
[85:01.43]Well, looks like we're just gonna have to barrel in here and scream at this guy.
[85:04.73]Oh, shit.
[85:06.13]Okay, wait, wait.
[85:07.85]Alright, there's the twitch.tv symbol.
[85:09.47]We just gotta get to the twitch.tv symbol and deactivate the channel.
[85:16.62]There's a tank in here.
[85:25.95]Oh my god, why do they know I'm in here?
[85:27.57]How do I turn?
[85:28.19]Where's the alarm I have to turn off?
[85:32.70]Wait, what do you mean the alarm is right there?
[85:34.46]Where?
[85:41.36]Oh my fucking god.
[85:42.80]Dumb, stupid, imbecile streamer.
[85:45.26]Fuck this idiot.
[85:46.50]Stupid, dumb, fuck-faced.
[85:52.47]Oh, no, no, no.
[85:54.01]Three.
[85:55.21]Four.
[85:55.47]Alright.
[85:55.65]Now I'm just gonna stand here.
[86:09.03]How long do you think this takes?
[86:16.50]These guys are all hidden.
[86:17.70]They're inside the walls and shit.
[86:22.74]The music is still playing.
[86:23.60]No, here he is.
[86:24.02]Okay.
[86:29.81]You saw... Oh my fucking god.
[86:35.77]Blast it, Jeffrey!
[86:51.28]I can't even aim at anybody.
[86:54.12]What was that?
[86:57.68]What is going on with this guy?
[87:03.36]Okay, just one more.
[87:05.54]Almost.
[87:06.50]Not quite.
[87:07.28]We're almost there.
[87:09.22]Okay, got him.
[87:10.42]One more?
[87:10.72]In the chest or something, maybe?
[87:13.92]Got him.
[87:14.66]Nice work.
[87:19.67]He's taunting me.
[87:22.31]He was just standing there like, no, you know.
[87:24.95]I don't fucking think you're going to be able to do this.
[87:26.79]Just go.
[87:27.19]I want to... Hold on a minute.
[87:32.22]Wait.
[87:41.10]Can I shoot this guy with this?
[87:45.31]Good thing this guy has the same amount of skill points as I do in the right places.
[87:47.97]Alright.
[87:49.19]6B.
[87:50.29]6B.
[87:52.09]There's 4D, 4F, 4, 5, 6, 5.
[87:52.99]Alright, I need 6BA.
[87:58.15]There it is.
[87:59.32]Oh, you dumb motherfucker.
[88:00.20]There it is.
[88:00.48]Okay, good.
[88:05.22]I missed.
[88:06.58]I think I missed.
[88:11.88]What?
[88:20.79]I was not supposed to do that?
[88:21.87]I, uh, you know, I fired a missile at the, uh, at the prowler.
[88:28.56]You know, I, uh, fired a fucking missile at him.
[88:31.90]Is this game too loud?
[88:34.53]Might be.
[88:34.85]Let's drop it a little bit.
[88:40.73]Yeah, not even the missile was accurate.
[88:42.29]I can't even aim a missile and hit a guy.
[88:48.07]Yeah, like the title of this stream or video or whatever should just be the fucking inaccurate QCQ specialist.
[88:54.65]That's like the title.
[88:59.38]I know, impressive stuff.
[89:00.70]Actually punch him though.
[89:01.54]That would be nice.
[89:16.22]This game is actually pretty fun, though.
[89:18.82]All like, jokiness aside, this is fun.
[89:21.38]Alright, I need to... I gotta deactivate the crane.
[89:31.59]Okay, no more alarms.
[89:33.39]And... I'll be fine.
[89:37.95]I think I'm supposed to pick these up?
[89:41.87]How does one pick this up?
[89:42.87]Well, here's the car.
[89:44.05]No, to crack the safe situation here.
[89:49.67]That was in there.
[89:50.35]It was.
[89:52.56]Don't tell me it wasn't.
[89:56.26]And we got 2,500 bucks.
[89:57.60]How do I... Can I move the car?
[89:59.72]No.
[90:01.60]Why do these things look like they're climbable?
[90:03.46]I guess they are.
[90:07.91]Healing.
[90:08.59]Very necessary right now.
[90:10.39]Thank you very much.
[90:13.41]Ammo.
[90:14.97]Reload this bad boy.
[90:16.21]I'm such a bad boy.
[90:19.26]God, I'm such a badass.
[90:20.39]What a bad boy.
[90:23.73]We're almost at the prince.
[90:26.67]Defeat his guards.
[90:29.51]Alright, we can just have the... They're gonna think it's a ghost that opened the door.
[90:35.96]Yep, see, he's like, who's there?
[90:38.48]Bait him.
[90:38.94]How many people are there?
[90:39.68]One, two.
[90:41.28]Three.
[90:43.18]Four.
[90:45.90]So, I'm gonna do this.
[90:46.90]I'm gonna run around in a circle like this.
[90:50.23]And they're going to hear the footsteps, and they're going to come in here and investigate, and I'm going to knock them both out with one punch.
[90:55.44]They're curious.
[90:59.80]Okay.
[91:00.02]I'm just going to do some tap dancing, and they'll come down here.
[91:07.39]Come on, guys.
[91:07.81]Really?
[91:10.43]There's sprinting noises over here, and you're not even going to check it out?
[91:18.59]They're aiming down the hallway.
[91:19.65]Will you come down the hallway and investigate?
[91:21.53]Do your job.
[91:22.31]Do your job, okay?
[91:24.49]Do your job.
[91:25.15]Dirty jobs.
[91:26.87]With Mike Rowe.
[91:27.45]Dirty jobs.
[91:29.07]Somebody's going to do it, but, you know, it ain't going to be me.
[91:33.19]I'm going to show up for one episode and, like, climb in a sewer.
[91:36.47]Dirty jobs.
[91:38.19]I make $900,000 a year.
[91:38.73]Dirty jobs.
[91:51.19]Where's the prince?
[91:52.31]Prince!
[91:54.87]That's the prince right there.
[91:58.79]Was it?
[91:59.05]No, it wasn't.
[91:59.47]Where's the prince?
[92:10.06]Okay, I was there.
[92:14.76]Got it?
[92:15.36]Come on.
[92:15.68]I need an A+.
[92:23.28]Where's this last guy?
[92:24.18]Where are you?
[92:25.60]Oh my god.
[92:32.74]Lockbox.
[92:33.78]I got a grenade.
[92:34.36]Alright, I can go into the prince's room with a grenade.
[92:36.28]That's very important.
[92:38.90]I would attribute this to making sure you have, like, full Estus Flask when you go fight, for instance, a Gaping Dragon.
[92:46.84]Make sure you have a full Estus.
[92:48.88]Make sure you bring a grenade into every one of these scenarios.
[92:53.32]Here we go.
[92:53.72]I'm gonna... Reassuring.
[92:56.18]Intimidating.
[92:57.12]It's a different voice actor.
[92:57.94]Somebody already shot them!
[92:59.12]Into the wall, in fact!
[93:21.05]Pretty ridiculous.
[93:21.89]I'm not sure who would do that.
[93:24.63]You come a few days ago.
[93:26.09]Maybe you could have killed them instead of my men.
[93:28.56]Mike, this is bad news.
[93:30.24]If he's telling the truth.
[93:32.06]What you do now, huh?
[93:33.68]Kill me?
[93:34.86]Let not get your missiles back.
[93:37.02]He's pulling every clever villain.
[93:40.06]If we let him go, he could lead us to the people he sold the missiles to.
[93:44.09]Or they might come after him.
[93:46.11]Either way, we win.
[93:47.67]But if he can't lead us to the buyers, then we've led a killer campaign.
[93:52.59]So what do I do here?
[93:53.21]That was tough.
[93:53.75]I want the money.
[93:54.97]Now.
[93:55.31]Alright, now shoot him anyways. $15,000.
[94:23.52]Nice.
[94:25.95]That's such a terrible way to explain that.
[94:33.75]That's so funny.
[94:34.75]Yeah, yeah, I did that because he would have not believed me if I didn't take 15 grand from him.
[94:40.45]Alright, we got XP earned.
[94:44.28]6 out of 7.
[94:46.04]That's a pretty good grade.
[94:47.22]$38,000. $38,000.
[94:52.38]Oh, whoops, I completely skipped the other screen.
[94:54.42]Oh well.
[94:56.24]Level up.
[94:58.24]Ten points.
[95:02.01]Can't do this yet.
[95:04.95]Might as well put this into... I mean, we have to have at least... some.
[95:11.73]What about toughness?
[95:16.10]Three missiles for $15,000. $15,000.
[95:19.37]yeah that was the equivalent of a bunch of fireworks you know you have like that like drunk uncle that every single year he spends like five grand on a bunch of elaborate fireworks that's what that was alright uh weapons pistols I'm using pistols now
[95:48.87]a new car costs more money yeah it does um what do I want to do here got perks Loose Cannon aggressive and the big picture knowing fell well that the ends justify the means you let nazri go receiving a bribe as well as a connection to the underworld market five percent weaponry discount from all's discount
[96:20.32]I'm going in toughness.
[96:22.98]And then... I should put like a point into stealth.
[96:28.16]Yeah.
[96:29.66]Reduce the range with... Cameras and enemies alerted to your presence are not affected by the vision reduction.
[96:35.74]That's fine.
[96:37.86]Discount.
[96:40.82]Confirm.
[96:41.52]Yes!
[96:41.66]Now I have a lot of money.
[96:49.22]I'm going to put in a new armor.
[96:54.66]Can I buy a new beard too?
[96:55.84]Can I buy new stuff?
[97:01.60]Interceptor body armor.
[97:03.59]Good endurance and noisy.
[97:08.09]Quiet and low endurance.
[97:12.07]Sound dampening.
[97:12.91]Tactical utility armor.
[97:15.23]More inventory space.
[97:16.51]Upgradable armor.
[97:18.97]Can't afford that.
[97:19.75]Ability cooldown.
[97:26.86]More ammo.
[97:29.56]Damage resistance.
[97:38.79]I think I'm going to go with this thing.
[97:41.01]Stealth is... No.
[97:44.45]Less sound dampening.
[97:45.51]Less inventory space.
[97:47.96]More endurance.
[97:49.53]If I am gonna be shoot me a hundred times, punch everybody person.
[97:56.75]Yeah, I'm gonna get this one.
[97:59.65]And then we'll take a look at here.
[98:00.56]First aid kit.
[98:03.04]Incendiary bomb.
[98:07.16]Fire.
[98:08.44]Radio mimic.
[98:10.38]EMP charge.
[98:11.28]Sound generator.
[98:13.79]A tool for deception and harassment.
[98:18.45]Yeah, bring this to, like, a concert and, like, hold it in the air and hold the button down.
[98:26.23]You ruin a lot of people's day.
[98:27.53]Alright.
[98:29.21]I think we're gonna use this.
[98:31.28]Flashbang, remote mine, shock trap.
[98:34.76]Upgrade.
[98:35.40]Alright, I want the speech jammer.
[98:43.56]Oh my god, these are $10,000. $10,000.
[98:51.35]That is a lot of money.
[98:54.23]Anything else I want to do here?
[98:58.99]Flashbang.
[99:06.19]I already have seven fucking grenades.
[99:07.73]Alright.
[99:09.95]We're going to keep everything here for now.
[99:11.35]Unless I want Samuel Sidewinder.
[99:15.29]Samuel Sarah.
[99:16.17]Why is everybody Sam?
[99:17.90]Sam, why do you own all these guns?
[99:20.93]Samuel.
[99:21.63]Sam.
[99:23.02]Salmon.
[99:23.98]Sam and Sideminder.
[99:25.12]What if that said that?
[99:26.16]Everyone would be like, what the fuck?
[99:28.44]Let's get a silencer.
[99:34.88]And a... I just spent $10,000 on a giant Bluetooth speaker.
[99:41.76]Yeah, that's fine.
[99:46.40]So... Okay, I just bought that gun.
[99:50.68]Is there like an equipment screen that I can see?
[99:53.83]Where's my inventory?
[99:55.15]Oh, there it is.
[100:01.29]Alright, armor.
[100:05.19]This one.
[100:06.67]Armor mod.
[100:07.55]Don't have any.
[100:11.34]Oh, okay.
[100:12.24]Models.
[100:13.62]We've got the Hamilton.
[100:17.16]This one has better stability.
[100:20.34]Hamilton AR-21.
[100:21.84]This one's better.
[100:26.56]I just bought this.
[100:27.77]I just bought it.
[100:28.37]Okay, guys?
[100:33.29]We're decking out this thing for good.
[100:36.11]Slot number two.
[100:37.81]Hamilton 12 gauge.
[100:39.31]Barrels.
[100:40.57]Sights.
[100:41.76]Magazines.
[100:42.94]Accessories.
[100:45.84]I don't have anything for it.
[100:46.80]That's fine.
[100:49.70]So much for martial artists.
[100:50.90]No, this is just to have the guns upgraded in case I need to use it so I don't alert anybody.
[100:57.39]I'm ready for the next mission.
[101:00.61]And now, the next case.
[101:03.97]Bologna!
[101:06.64]No, no, no, no, no!
[101:07.42]That's bologna!
[101:10.02]Anyone know what that is?
[101:14.44]Oh, thank God.
[101:20.26]No, I can't take my beard off.
[101:24.80]Alright, sound generator.
[101:28.12]Gadget 2.
[101:29.97]First aid kit.
[101:30.63]Gadget 3 will be explosive grenade.
[101:33.73]Gadget 4 will be EMP charge.
[101:39.43]I didn't say bazinga.
[101:42.16]Bazinga?
[101:43.10]Really, guys?
[101:43.84]Really?
[101:44.56]Really?
[101:47.91]Okay, bug.
[101:48.67]Investigate the weapon stockpile and bug this person.
[101:52.05]Let's bug the airfield.
[101:55.71]Reports indicate Shahid may be using an airfield east of Jizan.
[101:59.14]Infiltrate the airfield, download the flight logs, and get out without being spotted.
[102:03.72]Good thing I just put a point into stealth.
[102:07.46]I'm going to get constant encouragement from Mina.
[102:12.66]Looks pretty good to me.
[102:16.92]What?
[102:19.15]Why did I lose access to this?
[102:22.07]What the fuck is going on here?
[102:23.63]What are you doing?
[102:24.29]Why is it keyboard and mouse controls?
[102:25.49]Just say the title.
[102:27.17]God damn it.
[102:27.47]Why did this happen?
[102:48.09]This assignment with Shahid is probably the biggest one I've been involved in.
[102:51.53]What other assignments have you been on?
[102:53.35]I went undercover with Parker and Milan as a contractor for Halbeck.
[102:56.23]Really boring TV to have.
[102:57.23]It's how we found out the missiles were gone in the first place.
[102:59.35]Although it was too late to stop Shahid.
[103:03.49]The incident with the airline... Revenge!
[103:05.55]We'll catch him and make him... I will show you revenge.
[103:10.09]I'm just worried he's going to take... Oh fuck, he's going for the village!
[103:14.20]that's right it might be years before he turns up again he's not getting away I'll hunt him down no matter where he hides alright Mike but remember the missiles are more dangerous than he is still without the protocol what I don't understand is why the united states would want to keep this operation secret don't they want shaheed captured I think it's the missiles that are the problem hellback's a substantial government contractor the fact the missiles were involved
[103:43.08]So we're cleaning up a Halbeck mess.
[103:45.20]Partly.
[103:46.50]But if word of the stolen missiles gets out, it'll hurt the United States even more.
[103:51.37]Why is this pre-recorded?
[103:53.31]Oh, I'm watching a pre-recorded stream.
[103:55.49]I see what you mean.
[103:56.09]Or all the names this program has had.
[103:58.49]It carries out missions without the knowledge of other U.S.
[104:00.89]agencies.
[104:02.33]Why do I lose access to my controller?
[104:05.20]It allows us to move quickly when need be.
[104:08.91]No one said that.
[104:09.75]Yes, they did.
[104:11.11]You can't fool me.
[104:12.59]I have hyperintelligence.
[104:14.03]You can't fool me with a hyperintelligent brain.
[104:16.07]Sorry, guys.
[104:16.68]I can move shit with my mind.
[104:17.56]I didn't even tell you that.
[104:20.48]Alright, I'm done with you.
[104:21.80]Interesting.
[104:22.12]I guess that's good to know.
[104:22.82]I wonder if I'd get a new name if Alpha Protocol shut down.
[104:38.95]Why did you turn off my screen too?
[104:51.67]I wasn't ready.
[104:52.23]I needed to change my control scheme.
[104:55.17]Oh man, this is gonna be a disaster.
[104:57.05]Who just shot a gun?
[104:58.07]Somebody just shot a gun at me.
[105:03.90]Alright.
[105:04.24]Wait a minute.
[105:05.02]Options.
[105:05.36]What's going on here?
[105:05.96]Controls.
[105:07.08]Turn on the gamepad.
[105:09.22]Why are you turning it off?
[105:10.44]What the fuck are you doing?
[105:16.10]This is... Okay.
[105:17.02]What the hell is going on here?
[105:20.18]Alright.
[105:20.90]Now I can use it again.
[105:22.38]There we go.
[105:22.86]Cameras everywhere.
[105:23.48]Okay.
[105:28.29]I just made the Halloween noisy sounds.
[105:29.89]Wait.
[105:29.99]What?
[105:34.40]I just have like a fart machine.
[105:37.19]Why would you throw a grenade?
[105:38.57]That's so stupid.
[105:48.27]Alright, more grenades.
[105:49.91]Okay.
[105:51.89]What if I run up to him and do this?
[106:00.37]No, they're not afraid of the noise.
[106:02.81]It just says, please come to my location.
[106:07.99]Wait, one last ditch effort.
[106:17.82]I know, I'm just, I'm a mic spammer.
[106:23.29]Just with a shitty mic.
[106:41.97]I'm still talking.
[106:44.43]Why are you fucking up my controller every time I go to a menu?
[106:47.93]Wait a minute, this is like getting really annoying actually.
[106:52.43]What the fuck is going on here?
[106:56.31]Give me back access to my controller.
[107:10.01]Turn, keep it on.
[107:14.02]Alright, reload last checkpoint.
[107:15.18]Let's go.
[107:15.50]Alright, so... Bug the tower.
[107:27.20]Don't use the sound device unless you're gonna use it for some other reason, right?
[107:33.26]Why did... Honest to god, what was that?
[107:37.61]I need to reload this.
[107:40.11]Right?
[107:40.71]Everyone just heard the fucking machine gun fire.
[107:46.42]Maybe they didn't.
[107:47.20]Okay.
[107:47.54]I think I'm still okay.
[107:53.12]I'll just do a front flip and then... I have to be stealthy.
[108:00.39]I can't alert anything.
[108:02.29]Just play it stealthy.
[108:03.83]Play it right.
[108:05.05]Let's see where everybody is.
[108:08.24]Looks like we got... Nobody here.
[108:15.26]Okay.
[108:15.64]Climb up.
[108:15.96]Anybody up here right?
[108:16.90]Nah, I don't wanna get exposed.
[108:17.92]Mm-hmm.
[108:18.08]Eventually make my way over there.
[108:19.60]Let's drop down this way.
[108:37.20]There's probably something in there, but who cares?
[108:42.08]Climb up the tower.
[108:43.04]Maybe I can go from there and jump out of the boxes.
[108:52.64]Can't, like, deactivate or anything.
[108:55.70]So what's the point of coming up here?
[108:58.54]Get a good view.
[109:07.23]I don't want to get exposed.
[109:09.89]Alright, slow it down.
[109:12.28]Weren't there just like five guards here?
[109:14.56]Watch that camera!
[109:19.70]I'm going to accidentally press the stupid noisemaker from the dollar store.
[109:25.45]Anybody inside?
[109:27.77]No, doesn't look like it.
[109:28.61]Does that camera go all the way over here?
[109:34.14]Doesn't.
[109:35.63]I have an opportunity to get rid of this.
[109:37.09]Disable.
[109:37.91]Bypass the key code.
[109:42.65]To... Oh, no.
[109:46.07]Oh, no!
[109:47.51]Oh, no!
[109:48.93]Oh!
[109:49.31]Which one is it?
[109:49.93]Got it.
[109:53.01]Oh, no!
[109:53.91]Ammo.
[110:00.80]Oh, if I'm trying to sneak around, I'm using the noisiest armor I have.
[110:10.27]Nobody up on the rafters with a sniper rifle or something stupid.
[110:15.26]No.
[110:18.62]Why did I go all the way around?
[110:19.90]There's just a camera.
[110:24.82]I... I can just run across.
[110:28.22]Make sure you play it really stealthy.
[110:39.02]Alright, 1F.
[110:40.29]There it is.
[110:44.25]5, 9, 3, 7, 9, 5, 5, 9.
[110:44.95]Got it.
[110:49.31]That gives me access to what?
[110:52.59]What do I do?
[110:52.97]What?
[110:53.97]I just, okay, open the gate?
[110:59.97]Yeah, gate's open now.
[111:01.92]Don't want to go through the front door, do I?
[111:03.98]No.
[111:04.46]Wait for that to turn.
[111:09.18]Can I climb this?
[111:09.82]No, let's just wait.
[111:10.54]I'm going to do this right.
[111:13.18]Don't do it.
[111:15.48]Jeremy, stop it.
[111:17.54]I don't have access to the controller anymore.
[111:19.90]Stop it.
[111:20.86]Don't do that.
[111:22.53]I want him in.
[111:23.03]I want to fucking blow it up.
[111:23.97]Don't fucking blow that up.
[111:25.97]Do it.
[111:26.31]Give me the fucking controller.
[111:27.89]It actually... I don't have access to the... I got access.
[111:34.17]I'm back on the mouse and keyboard now.
[111:39.70]I can control a Jerm I just like took it from him well I don't know why this keeps happening though actually is pretty annoying okay alright I'll calm down I won't do it better not oh my god what is happening what is this like a shitty cable I don't understand
[112:09.64]I think this cable just sucks ass.
[112:11.84]For some reason.
[112:15.76]I believe you.
[112:16.26]You're gonna be like a good boy.
[112:17.54]Just stop doing that.
[112:24.53]Nobody here.
[112:26.09]Go.
[112:33.79]Eat the controller's ass.
[112:40.71]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[112:43.29]Somebody's freaking out.
[112:44.10]Somebody's coming in right now.
[112:50.06]Oh, god damn it.
[112:50.85]Why do these guys show up now?
[112:56.15]Why did you... All these guys just appeared.
[113:01.54]Give me a break.
[113:02.23]Don't saw the fucking... Blow it up!
[113:07.84]What is going on?
[113:08.76]Why?
[113:20.39]Okay.
[113:21.17]You know, in a video game, the boss has a mechanic where if you don't jump and he smashes both of his hands down on the ground, it fucking does a lot of damage and everybody gets hit by it and you go up really, you just got to go over like a zero G roller coaster for a second.
[113:38.46]And that's what just happened.
[113:40.34]We all didn't jump when we were supposed to dodge that attack.
[113:51.22]Alright, but let's be honest here for a second.
[113:54.24]That was bullshit.
[113:56.00]Those guys all just appeared out of nowhere.
[113:57.50]They spawned in.
[114:06.71]And that's that.
[114:08.77]Oh, I got the cameras off.
[114:13.31]What the fuck are you?
[114:15.39]What?
[114:21.03]here last time oh my god I get it up there can I get it up there can I get it up there
[114:49.95]I'm confused.
[114:50.54]I have to get up there.
[114:57.50]I have to.
[114:59.46]Get me over here.
[115:08.32]I'm getting up there and I'm fucking throwing this in his head.
[115:10.53]I'm gonna hit him with this.
[115:12.03]Just watch me.
[115:12.63]I'm so irritated by this.
[115:15.11]There's no way I don't get this guy.
[115:21.75]I don't care if I have to restart the mission.
[115:24.83]That guy's getting a grenade in his window.
[115:28.00]Where is he?
[115:28.30]Like, right here?
[115:30.86]Where is that guy?
[115:42.18]What?
[115:45.30]No, this is the other side.
[115:46.34]This is not the right way.
[115:49.04]Oh, you fucking...
[115:57.01]Got money.
[115:58.17]Do I really need to restart this thing?
[116:05.02]I'm going to throw this in his fucking face.
[116:06.94]I'm so irritated by this.
[116:09.52]Yeah, I gotta get that open, but hold on.
[116:13.26]Shit, now I have to actually throw it.
[116:23.33]Almost there, almost there.
[116:25.49]Got it.
[116:26.47]Fuck!
[116:35.10]Fucking care.
[116:42.48]You think I give a shit right now?
[116:47.16]Got it.
[116:47.60]No, I didn't get it!
[116:49.90]Get it!
[116:51.33]Got it.
[117:04.11]Where is it?
[117:09.00]Alright, I just went like psycho.
[117:12.00]Climb the ladder really slowly with your fucking demon powers.
[117:26.11]Just restart it.
[117:27.01]Like, honest to god.
[117:34.87]No more joking around.
[117:36.01]No more fucking around.
[117:36.79]Actually, I keep saying that.
[117:38.05]But, you know, I'm going to have trouble.
[117:39.99]Where am I?
[117:40.95]And it's saved in an awful place.
[117:44.16]Oh, well.
[117:44.58]Just play it smart here.
[117:46.30]Jump off this.
[117:52.90]No more dicking around.
[117:53.96]Get the health.
[117:55.52]Hack the other thing that's over here.
[117:57.34]Don't just go running out into the open.
[118:01.09]And I just ran into the open.
[118:02.75]No, I didn't.
[118:04.70]Here's the other thing I have to hack.
[118:06.18]Right?
[118:07.86]There's another door to go in.
[118:11.53]Shotgun, but I don't... Here we go.
[118:12.93]Right?
[118:13.11]I already did this one.
[118:16.67]So, there's that guy.
[118:19.77]So, I need to go around here.
[118:22.84]Watch out for those explosive barrels.
[118:28.94]Get out of my life.
[118:31.04]Alright, where is another computer that I can break into?
[118:36.06]Collect everything.
[118:39.22]Armor mod.
[118:40.14]Alright, that's good.
[118:41.50]Cool.
[118:45.20]Can I drag this?
[118:46.06]No.
[118:46.76]I can go up, though.
[118:51.66]I mispronounced shoot those barrels.
[118:57.94]I have to get out of this.
[118:58.92]I have to do this right.
[119:00.12]I don't even know what that way is.
[119:07.71]I don't even know what that word means.
[119:10.43]I can't jump?
[119:13.22]Why not?
[119:18.58]Alright, loading that checkpoint fucked up my brain because I don't even know what direction I was even going to begin with.
[119:27.11]Because this door is not open.
[119:29.77]The gate's not open.
[119:30.59]I have to hack another computer to open that gate.
[119:37.29]Right?
[119:37.43]Because this... I have to go this way.
[119:39.75]I can't go straight across.
[119:42.95]Do I have to go up there and then jump off or something?
[119:45.17]Because I already used that computer.
[119:48.81]Is there any other way for me to go?
[119:54.42]Okay.
[120:01.52]Got it.
[120:07.41]That's interesting.
[120:11.31]Now let's play stealthy.
[120:15.35]Who is around right here?
[120:16.51]There's a guy down there.
[120:18.67]Oh, you fucking stupid idiot.
[120:20.57]That guy's still just sitting there.
[120:23.33]Why are you still aiming over here?
[120:28.32]I can't even hit this guy.
[120:29.44]There's no way I'm going to be able to shoot this guy from this far away.
[120:31.84]Oh my god.
[120:39.48]Aim it over here.
[120:41.00]Use the zipline.
[120:43.82]Okay.
[120:45.05]That was fun.
[120:53.61]Okay.
[120:54.44]I'll take it.
[120:55.04]I'll take it for what it is.
[121:00.62]I'll just wait until somebody walks around and then they'll eventually...
[121:06.07]There's no way you would have known that.
[121:07.95]He just took a guess.
[121:09.09]As long as I don't make any screaming noises like that hurt, he won't know I'm here.
[121:17.40]You know what?
[121:17.78]I'm going to take a guess and see if he's open.
[121:24.92]God.
[121:28.42]Fuck.
[121:29.32]No.
[121:29.68]Get underneath him.
[121:30.24]He can't aim down here.
[121:31.76]He can't aim underneath him.
[121:36.41]Just get inside of a building.
[121:39.42]Made it.
[121:40.28]What?
[121:40.54]What?
[121:40.76]This guy's sleeping.
[121:41.86]What is... Why was he lying down?
[121:46.94]There was no reason for him to be lying down.
[121:53.97]Oh my fucking god.
[122:00.97]Oh my god, please don't kill me.
[122:02.17]Not this far ahead.
[122:06.75]I deactivated the alarm.
[122:09.05]I'm good to go.
[122:10.91]I just have to wait a little bit for this to recharge.
[122:13.79]And I'm going to be fine.
[122:15.74]Drink water?
[122:18.00]What do you mean drink water?
[122:22.34]Drink water?
[122:32.46]Why do I have water?
[122:36.74]What are you talking about?
[122:46.93]That sucks.
[122:48.23]I need to put... Okay.
[122:50.37]We're gonna have to put a few points into pistols.
[122:53.54]Because I'm getting kind of sick of being at point blank and shooting all around them.
[123:00.60]Like a Yosemite Sam cartoon.
[123:06.83]Hold on, somebody just came by.
[123:10.81]I didn't even do that.
[123:11.49]I didn't even get the pleasure of doing that.
[123:20.58]Finally.
[123:22.08]I thought that was not going to work out.
[123:24.60]Let's just get on there and start shooting people.
[123:28.71]I can't get up there.
[123:29.49]Of course I can't.
[123:30.35]Why would I be?
[123:33.61]I've lost all...
[123:37.30]I'm gonna die if I don't hydrate in five minutes.
[123:41.89]Hold on.
[123:42.27]Well, somebody gave 50 bucks.
[123:45.37]Let me just see who the hell that was.
[123:48.63]Uh, it was E-Wort-Wort-E-Wort-Wort.
[123:51.23]Thank you for the $50, dude.
[123:54.56]Uh, thank you for the $50.
[123:56.02]I just said repeated.
[123:57.40]I just rewind my brain eight seconds.
[124:01.36]When's the next Stanley Parable stream?
[124:03.72]Also, just letting you know, I work for the Federal Police, and we're actually, we've narrowed it down to 24 murders that you've been linked to.
[124:12.87]We recently found Etalyx' body in the Charles River.
[124:18.46]Etalyx is streaming right now.
[124:21.10]So, I don't believe you.
[124:24.08]Second of all, thank you so much, dude.
[124:27.46]He set a dead beam.
[124:30.12]Hey guys, guess what happened?
[124:31.40]My controller doesn't work.
[124:40.70]Okay, out we go.
[124:45.27]But thank you for the 50 bucks.
[124:48.73]Appreciate it.
[124:51.55]There's no reason.
[124:53.15]Just break the doors open and just punch.
[124:57.84]What am I doing?
[124:59.20]What do you mean, that's the last of them?
[125:03.08]Reputation with Mina is improved, okay?
[125:05.06]So apparently I just have to come in here and touch them.
[125:08.58]Interesting.
[125:20.98]No, no, no, no, no!
[125:22.05]Don't, no!
[125:28.71]Why?
[125:29.49]Did that just happen?
[125:32.15]Why did I fly that far?
[125:46.06]Checkpoint.
[125:47.30]Checkpoint!
[125:49.22]Checkpoint!
[125:51.04]Cruisin', yeah.
[125:53.66]Cruisin' USA.
[125:55.24]What happens if I do this, funny stream?
[126:01.61]Oh, nothing.
[126:02.13]I thought it was a bomb.
[126:07.25]That guy's limping.
[126:18.73]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[126:26.44]My immersions, broooo!
[126:29.24]What?
[126:32.98]Get out of my life.
[126:37.26]Okay.
[126:40.72]Don't!
[126:44.57]Idiot streamer, don't ever say that again.
[126:47.99]The next person that calls me an idiot is going to get in deep fucking trouble.
[126:59.28]And by deep trouble, I mean goodbye.
[127:02.46]Wave goodbye to that person.
[127:03.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 30, 100, 150, 200 people gone.
[127:05.40]500 people gone.
[127:06.18]1,000 people gone.
[127:07.20]Shut up, Jared.
[127:07.74]Not you guys, me.
[127:08.88]God damn it.
[127:37.35]You know what I was trying to do there.
[127:38.35]Autism.
[127:40.57]Nice.
[127:44.09]I want to pick up someone.
[127:47.27]There's probably shit down there that I want.
[127:49.79]Is there?
[127:50.03]Is there anything over there that I want?
[127:52.55]There's nothing over there I want.
[127:55.71]God, I don't even know what I want.
[127:58.68]I'm in the control tower now.
[128:00.64]Look around for any computers.
[128:04.76]Uh, how do I use... How do I switch weapons?
[128:07.79]There we go.
[128:14.35]Okay, I got the shotgun on now.
[128:22.44]Stealth shotgun.
[128:24.86]It's just like, you guys just know where I am at all times.
[128:36.73]I just got shot right in the head.
[128:46.70]Did I get him?
[128:52.02]One, two, three.
[128:59.40]Guy right here.
[129:05.97]This is so, this is just like embarrassing.
[129:09.89]For everybody involved.
[129:11.11]Fucking come on.
[129:18.96]This is embarrassing for everybody.
[129:21.50]Literally for all the people in this room.
[129:23.40]The shotgun isn't worth it.
[129:24.68]I need to put points into weapons.
[129:26.82]I'm not doing just punches.
[129:33.60]Now this time...
[129:35.72]This guy saw me immediately.
[129:37.06]Oh, you fucking... God damn it.
[129:45.05]They think it's that guy.
[129:46.51]They all just aimed at him.
[129:48.13]Perfect opportunity.
[129:48.97]I got a good opportunity right now.
[129:55.05]Didn't get anybody.
[130:07.23]Just be the trapdoor spider.
[130:08.33]I don't even care.
[130:12.91]No alarm yet, though.
[130:18.77]Okay, he's gonna load.
[130:22.85]Right when he reloads, they're going in for the kill.
[130:25.99]Shoot one more blast.
[130:28.27]And reload the gun.
[130:32.67]Okay, pick up the money.
[130:36.97]Love the gun.
[130:42.56]Got a lot of doohickeys here to play with.
[130:48.24]Why am I not hydrating?
[130:49.44]Okay, what's this hydration meme?
[130:53.16]Is this something that I'm supposed to laugh at?
[130:54.70]$5,000, damn.
[131:06.21]Hydration is... Yeah, what's this thing about, like, drinking water that's a meme?
[131:10.11]Why is that so funny?
[131:14.33]Have you heard this really funny joke, Jeremy?
[131:16.83]Drink water.
[131:17.55]Let's open this lock.
[131:31.49]XP.
[131:32.33]Oh, this is just an entrance into here.
[131:34.09]I gotta go up there.
[131:37.18]Health potion.
[131:40.64]Got loaded ammo.
[131:41.58]Got a grenade.
[131:42.13]So I have to bug the air... Somebody up here?
[131:47.11]Yeah.
[131:55.59]Can we shoot each other through this?
[131:58.13]I don't think... Maybe we can't.
[132:07.32]Okay.
[132:07.96]How many times do you have to get shot for you to die?
[132:10.58]Finally.
[132:17.25]Anybody else up here?
[132:19.39]That I need to know of?
[132:22.64]Doesn't look like it.
[132:23.70]There's plenty of money.
[132:27.18]More money.
[132:30.24]Rolling in dough.
[132:31.72]Okay.
[132:32.78]Plant the bug.
[132:35.47]C. Look over C. There it is.
[132:41.19]Idiot.
[132:41.83]A. There it is.
[132:49.35]Right here.
[132:50.83]Got it.
[132:51.17]Cool.
[132:53.09]So, okay.
[132:54.03]Completed mission.
[132:56.65]XP.
[132:57.05]Got it.
[132:58.87]Thwarted that person.
[132:59.95]Leveled up.
[133:00.37]Got 13-6.
[133:03.52]Enemies killed by fire out, four.
[133:04.98]Enemies killed by a gadget is one.
[133:08.06]Zero collateral damage.
[133:11.18]Sounds good.
[133:16.53]Aggressive Alderman.
[133:17.99]See, I just rang.
[133:19.45]That's some good ice water.
[133:20.37]It may be a problem in the future, though.
[133:33.83]If Shahid feels we're onto him, he'll bring his elite guard in, which could make your upcoming mission more difficult.
[133:39.05]I mean, hydration is no joke.
[133:40.09]That's correct.
[133:40.39]It'll spare me the trouble of tracking them down to kill them.
[133:42.61]But, I mean... Is the bug transmitting?
[133:45.14]Loud and clear.
[133:45.66]No problems.
[133:46.98]You can get hydration from a lot of places.
[133:48.24]Which is why I called.
[133:50.20]Looks like we have something.
[133:51.64]Shahid's coordinates and an ETA.
[133:53.96]How reliable is it?
[133:54.80]90%.
[133:55.56]I need to get... I want to get rid of this stupid haircut.
[133:58.75]And the transmission we're getting from the airfield confirms it.
[134:01.73]It looks like this is it, Mike.
[134:03.58]Westridge will be with you on the comm, and I'll be monitoring in case things get difficult.
[134:07.99]Sure.
[134:08.63]Bye.
[134:09.27]Alright, then.
[134:09.93]I'll get my gear and head out when I'm ready.
[134:11.99]Good luck, Mike.
[134:12.61]This is the first boss fight of the game.
[134:16.55]Awareness improves Mike's ability to sense enemy placement and positions.
[134:19.82]The basic level of this skill greatly extends... Okay.
[134:25.86]Sure.
[134:28.28]Silent running.
[134:29.80]I'm going to put...
[134:33.44]some points into pistols.
[134:37.96]I don't care what anybody says at this point.
[134:41.02]Now, wait a minute, but do I want to use pistols?
[134:43.14]No.
[134:44.56]Do I?
[134:44.82]I don't know what I want to do here.
[134:56.49]I still can't do any of that.
[135:00.83]Shotguns.
[135:01.29]This level of shotgun proficiency provides bonuses to recoil control and stability.
[135:08.38]Yeah, I'll be shotgun guy.
[135:11.96]Let's go for it.
[135:13.80]Mike can brace the shotgun for a knockdown shot by holding LT.
[135:17.46]The time it takes to ready a knockdown shot decreases with each level of improved shotgun.
[135:27.03]Martial arts and shotguns.
[135:32.24]Confirm that.
[135:36.30]I'm going to deck up my shotgun.
[135:37.44]I'm going to buy some shotgun improvements.
[135:41.62]I want... I want new everything.
[135:44.30]I don't care about my emails.
[135:50.53]I never check emails anyways.
[135:53.01]Alright.
[135:53.63]Shotguns.
[135:54.25]Let's take a look.
[135:56.69]Vengeance.
[135:57.17]Vengeance.
[136:01.34]This one is all, everything, accuracy, everything.
[136:03.82]This one's damage as well.
[136:07.10]104,000 don't have it.
[136:07.64]I can buy this one.
[136:13.25]But I can't do anything else.
[136:16.77]Let's get the vengeance.
[136:20.41]Okay, I went all in.
[136:21.25]I spent every single cent I have.
[136:24.77]Okay, let me sell.
[136:26.13]I'm going to sell the dumb Hamilton.
[136:36.27]I'm telling this stupid thing to Sell it all all of it Keep the shotgun sell this dumb thing to sell the scope for this Okay pistol shotgun Can I want to buy
[137:07.03]Now, let's go with like modifications, right?
[137:12.22]Do I have any?
[137:13.14]Alright, streamlined shotgun frame, modified choke.
[137:17.86]Increases accuracy but reduces recoil.
[137:20.42]I like that.
[137:24.43]Increases stability.
[137:25.31]Increases recoil.
[137:29.15]Oh my lord, there's a lot of things here.
[137:31.95]Phosphorus
[137:36.27]Increases recoil control, reduces damage.
[137:40.37]Increases damage, but reduces recoil.
[137:45.47]Increases recoil.
[137:49.13]Muzzle assist.
[137:54.58]I think I want to go with accuracy.
[137:56.52]Let's grab... Let's just get a basic shotgun sight.
[138:05.63]Yeah.
[138:07.25]Basic sites.
[138:12.40]Extended mag.
[138:15.24]And I can get one more, right?
[138:16.26]Let me just take a look at that first.
[138:38.08]Alright, Samuel.
[138:38.84]Okay, I'm going to sell the Samuel gauge.
[138:40.97]Then I can buy some more stuff.
[138:42.81]Can I sell that?
[138:47.67]Wait, I didn't sell my shotgun?
[138:54.18]My shotgun's still sitting there.
[138:55.20]Why can I not get rid of the...

[139:04.62]Wait a minute.
[139:06.26]Wait a minute.
[139:06.82]I thought this was the buy and sell menu.
[139:10.78]Wait, hold on.
[139:18.90]Wait, I thought this was changing the menu.
[139:21.72]What happened?
[139:22.74]Let me go.

[139:50.90]Get off of the stupid... Turn on the controller.
[139:58.60]Oh, it's... Seriously, it's this stupid fucking cord.
[140:01.96]It keeps disconnecting for some reason.

[140:14.59]Weapons.
[140:16.83]Models.
[140:18.05]Fuck me.
[140:22.47]So what even just happened right there?
[140:24.89]What happened to all my money?
[140:26.89]Did I just buy and sell at a loss over and over again until I don't have it anymore?
[140:39.16]So buy and sell.
[140:43.35]What happened to it?
[140:44.25]What did I spend my money on?
[140:47.37]What did I spend my money on?
[140:52.57]What do I even own?
[140:56.91]I'm reloading the checkpoint.
[140:58.69]I can't.
[140:59.47]There's no reloading checkpoint.
[141:02.99]Load checkpoint.
[141:06.03]Is this?
[141:06.61]Yeah.
[141:06.97]Save house.
[141:07.61]Load it.
[141:12.32]That menu is confusing.
[141:18.12]Here we go.
[141:24.02]There we go.
[141:24.80]Okay.

[141:54.65]Alright, now I would like to buy shotgun ammo.
[142:02.37]Basic sight.

[142:28.73]There it is.
[142:34.41]Never going to run out ever again.
[142:35.43]Let's go back to the menu.
[142:43.53]Let's go outfit ourself.
[142:47.63]No, where's my fucking wardrobe?
[142:50.09]This place sucks.
[142:52.41]I would never have done this.
[142:53.54]I would never have made it like this.
[142:54.68]I wouldn't have designed my house like this.
[143:02.53]And here we go.
[143:04.81]Vengeance.
[143:05.91]Barrels.
[143:07.21]I don't have any barrels.
[143:08.13]Sight.
[143:08.95]Basic sight.
[143:11.00]And nothing.
[143:12.64]But I can do this.
[143:14.20]Got it.
[143:15.24]Now I can sell the other shotgun.
[143:18.46]That's correct.
[143:24.36]It was right behind me.
[143:32.42]Sell it.
[143:34.21]Sell the Hamilton.
[143:36.53]And there we go.
[143:41.01]I am ready to go to the next mission.
[143:50.08]So I've got Intercept Shaheed and Recover Missiles.
[143:55.43]Let's intercept him.
[144:01.53]Okay, they're all gonna be there.
[144:05.37]I'm ready.
[144:07.15]I gotta capture or kill.
[144:09.76]Every time I see this I just get so irritated by how he looks.
[144:32.06]You need to get to the control tower.
[144:33.56]The control tower.
[144:34.52]Locate the missiles and disable them.
[144:38.94]So nothing on satellite.
[144:39.88]We're going to need you to transmit the exact coordinates.
[144:42.73]There's a lot of area to cover.
[144:44.45]And Al-Samad knows how to hide their stockpile.
[144:47.03]Why is he aiming at the door?
[144:48.87]Why would you be aiming at this door?
[144:50.53]Unless he knew I was coming.
[144:53.67]That guy's only job is to hold the minigun at the door.
[144:59.62]Okay.
[145:00.48]Sure.
[145:00.66]Sure.
[145:02.93]I need to wait until he turns around.
[145:13.89]Go on.
[145:14.19]I need to go to the left of that truck.
[145:21.21]He's just staring over there.
[145:22.13]He's going to be just completely blindsided by this movement.
[145:27.79]And... Here... we... go.
[145:37.37]Yep.
[145:38.05]Just like I thought.
[145:40.21]That is a mindless idiot.
[145:41.56]I could actually probably karate chop him.
[145:47.12]Can I climb up anything here?
[145:50.34]No.
[145:50.50]This is just a way to get around them.
[145:51.89]So now I have to wait until he comes back again.
[145:57.69]What is he doing?
[145:58.25]Now he's aiming over here.
[145:59.79]Now that guy's aiming over here.
[146:02.19]Did they see me?
[146:03.07]Or is this... Am I missing something here?
[146:07.50]Is this just part of their drills?
[146:11.38]How am I supposed to get over here?
[146:20.02]How does one walk by this without that guy seeing?
[146:23.02]I'm going to have to go up.
[146:24.56]I blew it.
[146:25.74]I blew it already, but that's okay.
[146:28.02]I had to go up there and across.
[146:38.44]If only I had any more accuracy.
[146:44.43]So we're gonna go up.
[146:49.05]Yep.
[146:51.61]Those little baby steps.
[146:55.29]Alright.
[146:56.03]Go for it.
[146:56.37]There's a ladder.
[147:00.87]There is no ladder here, is there?
[147:04.99]What was that?
[147:08.53]What was that?
[147:14.15]Who shot the gun?
[147:15.39]There's somebody coming in here right now, isn't there?
[147:31.07]Oh my fucking god.
[147:32.33]Give me a break.
[147:54.10]I... I'm at a loss.
[147:56.76]Okay, so I have to go back this way.
[147:58.39]The guy up there... I'm gonna have to go up there and stealth kill him, aren't I?
[148:01.81]There's no way I can walk through this without him dying.
[148:04.15]That guy has to die.
[148:05.01]But what about the guy that can see me right there?
[148:07.61]Is that guy looking at me?
[148:08.37]I can't even tell.
[148:09.37]Is that guy gonna shoot me?
[148:24.96]What is this guy's line of sight?
[148:26.38]What is a glasses prescription like?
[148:31.57]Why are you over here?
[148:38.39]Did he hear me move?
[148:42.53]Alright, I need to put points into stealth because apparently I'm wearing speakers for sneakers.
[148:49.30]I'm wearing speakers for sneakers!
[148:59.47]I gotta take off this stupid thing, too.
[149:01.17]I'm wearing, like, I'm wearing the loudest costume.
[149:03.99]Alright.
[149:15.79]I can zipline.
[149:16.35]Where does the zipline go?
[149:18.45]Is this a bad idea?
[149:19.07]Okay, forget about me.
[149:26.10]I made it.
[149:31.10]Okay.
[149:33.72]Who is in here?
[149:34.30]There's a guy right in this room.
[149:36.90]He's literally right here.
[149:39.22]Guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.
[149:41.40]Where's that guy going?
[149:42.18]Oh, guys.
[149:42.65]I'm gonna go up.
[149:44.31]No, I'm not.
[149:44.65]There's a guy looking at me over there.
[149:47.53]Shit.
[149:50.61]Okay, I have to get in this room.
[149:53.31]Bypass the key code right now and get this quick.
[149:58.89]Nice, nice and quick.
[149:59.77]Nice and clean and nice and quick.
[150:03.46]God damn it!
[150:11.88]I'm just pissed off and rushing now.
[150:15.57]I gotta turn off the alarm now.
[150:24.85]Oh my fucking god.
[150:33.44]Nice throw.
[150:44.66]I'm like seriously about to turn.
[150:47.38]I am so irritated right now.
[150:55.19]No, I want to do that again.
[150:56.35]Like that was horse shit.
[150:57.37]I just like fucking tried to rush because the guy in the window was looking at me and I got like spooked.
[151:06.67]Yeah, fuck off.
[151:07.59]This is how he's shooting at me.
[151:09.05]Oh my god.
[151:09.45]Why, game?
[151:09.77]Why are you like this?
[151:10.61]No, it's already rang!
[151:11.33]Uh...
[152:02.75]Fucking hell, I don't even care shotgun time It's time to pull out the fucking shotgun and make mayhem happen
[152:23.89]going against all stealth there why would you get off the gun to shoot me with your pistol that was not smart oh my god give me that why can I not use this why can I not use that gun
[152:53.15]It's just chaos.
[152:56.77]It's chaos.
[153:00.95]It's just total calamity.
[153:02.93]I have no control over anything that's going on.
[153:05.53]I've lost all control.
[153:20.18]Alright, you can stomp.
[153:25.09]Alright.
[153:26.75]So, let's take a moment here.
[153:30.59]Let's get some money.
[153:36.52]Don't, no, don't.
[153:37.44]I was going to say, don't ring the alarm, please.
[153:42.38]I need to turn off the alarm.
[153:48.54]What are you doing here?
[153:53.83]Okay, I got health.
[153:55.57]That alarm, I need to turn off the alarm.
[153:57.81]I need to disable it.
[153:58.83]Looks like I got full health.
[154:04.79]There's the alarm room.
[154:05.81]Okay, here we go.
[154:09.42]This one guy, though, is going to cause a problem.
[154:12.74]This guy has to die first.
[154:31.77]Turn off the alarm just dump some water on it Deactivate do this right don't rush it for no reason no one's going to get you That's not the right one.
[154:53.28]How could you have made that mistake like that?
[154:56.94]How could you let that happen?
[155:02.55]Okay.
[155:03.83]Sneak up the stairs.
[155:05.17]Checkpoint activated.
[155:06.17]It's slow.
[155:09.07]Who's up here?
[155:11.23]It's nobody here.
[155:16.70]It's just a microphone.
[155:20.00]Data disk.
[155:22.20]Part two is to intercept this radio call, hack the computer.
[155:27.94]Checking the logs now.
[155:31.41]Mm-hmm, here's this one.
[155:34.93]3F, 3F, 3F, 3, right.
[155:37.82]Where is it?
[155:38.44]I just had it right there, right above it.
[155:42.28]The missiles aren't anywhere near the runway.
[155:44.46]Looks like they're being held in a munitions depot in the mountains.
[155:47.01]Checking the satellite imagery now.
[155:48.27]I got to go like 0.5 miles.
[155:49.07]Looks like there's a small trail that leads to the rear of the depot.
[155:52.67]Marking it on your PDA.
[155:54.29]On it.
[155:54.57]Thanks.
[155:56.29]Locate the missiles.
[156:02.57]13.
[156:02.99]Navigate graveyard.
[156:08.24]I guess there's a graveyard.
[156:11.76]Somebody... What?
[156:22.53]I think that was the only guy left in the compound.
[156:25.53]He was trying to be a hero.
[156:31.80]That's pretty far away.
[156:32.94]I guess I can go this way.
[156:33.82]Alright, we've got three switches.
[156:39.42]Which is the right one to do?
[156:40.98]You don't even have to... I just have to press the button.
[156:43.02]Don't do anything.
[156:45.16]Guess this is where planes go to die.
[156:48.74]He's gonna see me immediately.
[156:52.02]Even while sneak walking, I need to put... Every other point I get is now going into stealth.
[156:57.69]For the remainder of this entire game.
[157:01.68]Who do we have here?
[157:03.73]We have one, two guards.
[157:07.25]Yeah, there's two guards here, and then a little bit further up there's a couple more.
[157:21.54]No, I just don't know.
[157:22.52]Their route seems to be right in the middle.
[157:24.12]As long as I can get behind this box...
[157:32.94]Right here.
[157:34.88]See where anybody goes.
[157:36.10]I don't want to do anything hasty.
[157:41.26]Does he come all the way?
[157:42.04]There's one more guy that comes this way, right?
[157:43.30]Let's hope I can get rid of this guy before he shows up.
[157:50.66]No.
[157:50.90]No barrel.
[157:51.33]I'm not doing the barrel.
[157:52.19]Oh, maybe I will do the barrel.
[157:53.19]Don't do the barrel.
[157:55.09]I think that's a mistake.
[158:07.39]What?
[158:11.67]Why?
[158:12.21]Dude, I did a... I did a take... It don't even matter.
[158:17.42]Like, you can't... I can't do stealth.
[158:18.98]I can't.
[158:19.26]I have to just shoot everybody.
[158:20.16]There's no way.
[158:22.14]They just fucking turn around instantly.
[158:23.94]I even tried to do a takedown.
[158:27.48]No, why would I do that when I can just do this?
[158:29.82]What are they all waiting for?
[158:39.05]That guy just fucking got up to get shot again.
[158:41.93]I wasn't even trying to hit that guy.
[158:55.97]That guy has a sniper rifle or something.
[158:57.47]Alright, it doesn't even matter.
[158:59.85]The door's already open.
[159:00.87]Just get in.
[159:14.71]Okay.
[159:15.50]There's one guy here.
[159:20.44]There's the... Alright, I can... I'm gonna wait till he shoots, blah blah blah blah, and then sprint around and punch him.
[159:25.20]Okay, ready?
[159:28.37]Wait till he shoots, he's gonna shoot, and he's gonna have to cool down for a second.
[159:46.99]I got the alarm in style.
[159:50.57]Style point.
[160:03.54]Play the game immediately following this one.
[160:05.62]What do you mean?
[160:06.54]There's a sequel or something?
[160:08.44]Well, that guy's looking for me.
[160:14.47]You're coming up on a weapons depot.
[160:18.39]Gate sealed off.
[160:19.79]Must be another way around.
[160:21.21]Alright, check out the surrounding buildings.
[160:23.39]See if there's another route inside.
[160:30.60]Every game is so hyper aware except for this one.
[160:35.64]And I missed him.
[160:37.44]I missed him.
[160:39.90]You gotta be kidding me.
[160:50.08]I'm not sure what was worse.
[160:51.06]Alright, don't be too crazy here.
[161:00.91]There's two guys.
[161:01.91]Okay, I have an idea.
[161:07.93]We're at the fuck it stage, you know what I mean?
[161:17.59]Nice, it worked.
[161:25.43]I ain't up there, buddy.
[161:30.11]I was down here.
[161:36.31]I really hope they're expecting a returning patrol.
[161:38.23]90... What is it right there?
[161:41.99]F7AF?
[161:43.73]A... No.
[161:45.00]5-7.
[161:46.24]Come on, don't do this to me.
[161:50.50]What does that do?
[161:57.73]Plenty of money.
[161:58.33]Are they coming in like a car?
[162:00.95]Are they going to be driving down here or something?
[162:02.67]Or not yet.
[162:03.09]Probably not yet.
[162:06.49]I could do for some health.
[162:07.97]That would be nice.
[162:08.69]Hmm.
[162:22.76]I didn't even do that for any reason at all.
[162:26.32]I just did that because I could.
[162:30.38]I can't jump through that?
[162:37.22]We're just going down.
[162:38.06]Okay.
[162:38.84]Get off.
[162:50.94]Again, I... I don't think they're very bright when they run up a hill.
[162:58.34]Every other scenario.
[163:00.59]They are hyper-intelligent.
[163:06.98]WHAT?! !
[163:26.55]I need health.
[163:28.49]Where is health before I die and I don't want to start over?
[163:31.63]There's the... Just get rid of it now.
[163:36.34]Just to save my ass in case it ever happens.
[163:38.62]Okay, there's a guy that's pissed off coming down this way.
[163:42.06]Just gonna open the door.
[163:49.96]Okie dokie.
[163:55.91]Guy right behind the door.
[163:56.71]Here we go.
[163:56.99]We're gonna surprise him.
[164:06.23]Good.
[164:06.45]Picking up the cash.
[164:17.21]There's gonna be two guys on these stairs.
[164:18.67]I'm gonna guarantee it.
[164:21.92]That is a 100% guarantee there's gonna be two guys right at the top here.
[164:31.46]Just kidding.
[164:36.84]They migrated to this room.
[164:42.09]Got a visual on the missiles.
[164:43.51]Looks like they're being loaded into a convoy outside the warehouse.
[164:46.85]Here's a decision.
[164:51.52]Yeah, I know.
[164:52.46]So I'm gonna sabotage the missiles like this?
[164:55.24]Deactivate the, no, get the cameras out of here.
[164:57.00]Let's see, where's this one?
[165:06.01]Right here.
[165:12.91]Mm-hmm.
[165:17.45]Silent, quiet.
[165:20.68]There are a lot of people.
[165:21.88]Okay, now they're sprinting around like crazy.
[165:23.82]I think they just heard the door smash open.
[165:27.62]Yes, they did.
[165:31.02]What do I have?
[165:31.48]I have explosive grenade.
[165:32.68]I have incendiary bomb.
[165:34.27]I might have to make this work here.
[165:38.25]I'm gonna cause like a sea of fire in front of me.
[165:43.39]No, no, not yet.
[165:44.75]Not necessary.
[165:50.01]Just have to go down there.
[165:51.05]Okay.
[165:57.32]See a fire?
[166:05.85]Don't think I need to yet.
[166:06.89]He's right here though.
[166:20.11]Oh, what the fuck is happening?
[166:45.90]Where's the checkpoint?
[166:47.62]Why is this guy not lighting on fire?
[166:50.44]That doesn't seem very fair.
[166:51.32]I didn't get him.
[167:05.05]Okay, thank god it's not that far away.
[167:08.31]At least I made myself look cool when I died.
[167:19.26]Deactivate the cameras.
[167:20.99]I'm a master at this, so I'm not gonna take very long.
[167:23.27]30.
[167:23.57]D1.
[167:27.53]Bingo.
[167:28.95]Camera's off.
[167:32.13]Let's be smart about this.
[167:36.23]You understand, like, how that doesn't make any sense.
[167:38.89]Why is he here?
[167:41.11]Why don't they just know I'm in here?
[167:43.83]They automatically just know where you are.
[167:53.97]There are three people down here.
[167:55.25]There might be health in this room.
[168:00.54]Why is... Who's throwing grenades?
[168:08.86]He threw a grenade and then ran this way.
[168:13.99]Do you understand how this don't make no sense to me?
[168:30.10]Oh my god.
[168:44.60]Cool view, cool view!
[168:46.69]Told you.
[168:48.29]I got a black belt.
[168:57.06]This don't make no sense to me.
[168:59.88]Was there a guy up here?
[169:02.07]Huh?
[169:03.09]Oh, it's you.
[169:03.85]I need to turn off the alarm.
[169:11.51]Alarm deactivated.
[169:23.16]Oh my God.
[169:32.38]That's so, what is happening to my guy?
[169:42.39]Just like a hacking in an online video game right now.
[169:51.64]Explosive fist.
[170:05.45]I'm just running.
[170:06.75]I'm running.
[170:09.69]I'm running through this.
[170:12.11]I'm just sprinting.
[170:16.31]Go.
[170:16.63]Go.
[170:16.97]Go.
[170:17.60]Go.
[170:17.98]Take the money.
[170:18.92]Take the money and run.
[170:20.00]Go on.
[170:20.54]Take the money and run.
[170:21.54]Take the money and run.
[170:22.60]I have given up on trying to do this.
[170:30.06]Disable cameras.
[170:31.39]Sneak around.
[170:32.05]No.
[170:37.71]Get rid of that.
[170:38.91]Who's this?
[170:40.67]I don't know who that was.
[170:54.55]Where is he?
[170:57.33]I got customized assault rifle.
[170:58.53]Got to do this good.
[171:07.76]Perfect.
[171:09.08]In.
[171:10.60]That's it.
[171:11.02]It's that easy.
[171:12.36]Goodbye.
[171:12.74]There he is.
[171:15.30]Headshot.
[171:15.54]Something is wrong.
[171:29.45]Have our men come to meet the trucks of the checkpoint with the assault vehicles at once.
[171:34.48]Okay, first, I thought that was just a gigantic square type.
[171:37.46]Should I take the shot?
[171:38.34]No, if we do that, we lose the missiles.
[171:40.44]But if you can still intercept the convoy, we have a chance.
[171:43.12]Alright, find missiles.
[171:46.17]Now I have to intercept him.
[171:48.31]How am I going to do that?
[171:50.19]Damn it.
[171:50.69]Looks like the convoy's already headed out.
[171:53.35]I wrote the convoy's answer.
[172:00.86]You got it.
[172:03.50]You got it.
[172:09.73]God damn it.
[172:10.61]Can I not aim it over there at him?
[172:18.62]You can't aim it at him.
[172:20.50]Remember, we gave the fuck up.
[172:23.06]Remember that, guys.
[172:36.91]Bounce it off the corner.
[172:38.49]Into his little cubbyhole there.
[172:40.85]Got him.
[172:41.29]Nice.
[172:41.73]Excellent work, Jeremy.
[172:42.67]Excellent fucking work.
[172:53.04]Dead.
[172:54.02]Go.
[172:58.94]Gonna have to run.
[173:06.54]Running out of time, Mike.
[173:08.35]Don't you think I know that?
[173:12.87]Okay, what else is over here?
[173:13.65]Bottle?
[173:14.49]What else?
[173:15.63]Ammo?
[173:17.25]I gotta run.
[173:17.73]Fuck.
[173:18.07]Just go, go, go, go, go.
[173:18.67]I don't have time for this.
[173:24.83]There's no time.
[173:25.41]We have to catch the truck.
[173:26.27]Where is it?
[173:27.87]Up on the top of the bridge.
[173:29.25]Looks like Shahid's second in command.
[173:31.46]And he's brought friends.
[173:36.76]Oh, god damn it.
[173:38.61]It is the first boss.
[173:42.51]Okay, I gotta play this smart.
[173:44.05]We're gonna do... Incendiary grenade.
[173:48.43]We're gonna throw it up on top.
[173:49.43]What are you doing?
[173:54.38]Shoot him!
[174:03.91]Oh, boy.
[174:04.29]Okay, we're gonna make this work.
[174:05.11]Ready?
[174:06.62]It's got to be right in a precise location.
[174:10.00]Up and over.
[174:11.92]No, no, it's not going to work.
[174:13.10]Hold on.
[174:14.66]I can't see.
[174:15.28]It's too bright up there.
[174:16.67]I can't see where it's going.
[174:18.17]Okay, there it is.
[174:19.61]Ready?
[174:21.41]He fucking knew.
[174:22.09]He heard me.
[174:23.15]One.
[174:25.23]Stop it.
[174:25.79]Oh, you dick.
[174:26.71]There it is.
[174:28.63]Perfect.
[174:31.87]He's going to be on fire, right?
[174:34.41]He's on fire, right?
[174:36.74]Got him.
[174:38.46]I actually did just, like, shoot him into the fire.
[174:43.20]Where is he hiding?
[174:48.43]I did it.
[174:48.77]What?
[174:54.59]What?
[175:05.20]What did I do?
[175:08.84]I have to destroy this?
[175:12.62]What do you mean?
[175:13.62]What do you mean?
[175:14.28]Why did I just do that?
[175:18.03]I don't even know where I'm supposed to be going right now.
[175:23.32]Oh shit.
[175:23.86]Oh my god.
[175:24.26]Wait a minute.
[175:24.98]Missile launcher.
[175:25.78]What?
[175:29.60]There's only one shot.
[175:31.52]Oh, I wasted it.
[175:32.40]I wasted the one shot.
[175:33.98]Nope, there's another one.
[175:36.20]I gotta make this one count.
[175:39.52]I gotta make this one count.
[175:41.30]I only got one more shot here.
[175:51.31]That didn't even destroy it.
[175:52.77]Wait, where's the other one?
[176:03.71]There's one more here.
[176:10.52]I have to finish this with grenades.
[176:11.60]I have two HP.
[176:26.93]I did that on purpose?
[176:27.81]I'm playing bad on purpose?
[176:29.53]No, it fucking tele... No, get the... Fine, I'll show it to you.
[176:36.18]You want to see me play the game well?
[176:37.46]Watch this.
[176:37.88]This is more like it.
[176:40.31]Time to use some Haldeck tech to resolve this problem.
[177:04.62]Did it!
[177:18.96]Alright, I got a gadget.
[177:22.22]Let's not be idiots here.
[177:24.64]Let's make this happen for real.
[177:31.51]Oh, well that was an idiot.
[177:33.59]They're just scattered around.
[177:36.33]Yeah, I'm not going to lie, this actually is going to be fairly difficult.
[177:43.94]Is there anything else up here?
[177:46.10]Here!
[177:46.42]I might have to actually restart this.
[178:01.36]Yeah, I'm gonna have to restart the game.
[178:09.31]I'm gonna clear out the people.
[178:20.27]I have three shots with the... Alright, when you hit the double B's, that means you have the weapon.
[178:28.49]Okay.
[178:29.21]Make sure I hit this.
[178:30.53]Right there.
[178:31.19]There.
[178:33.93]There's the... Watch it.
[178:39.19]The car's gonna explode.
[178:40.05]Why am I connected?
[178:40.89]Get off that.
[178:43.84]Pick it up.
[178:45.54]What are you thinking?
[178:55.33]One more shot.
[178:55.87]Alright.
[178:56.45]Got it.
[178:56.79]This is where I'm gonna make a choice here.
[179:21.07]Are we gonna get another bribe?
[179:22.05]What do you think?
[179:24.61]Should I just try to make as much money as I can?
[179:26.17]What?
[179:40.35]Oh, I'm remembering.
[179:41.75]Flo, you thought the death of one terrorist leader would somehow fix the world.
[179:49.14]And by the way, it looks like that disease you got from the shitty GPU you had spread to your neck.
[179:54.04]You might want to see a doctor.
[179:58.29]The fruity pebbles disease sure has spread through your bloodstream.
[180:08.23]That's not a good sign, by the way.
[180:10.16]Maybe you were just cornered.
[180:18.24]I just bought this graphics card.
[180:20.68]Am I about to take my anger out on this guy?
[180:24.34]I've only had this graphics card for like seven and a half months.
[180:28.24]After your extortion of Nasri, I was expecting a more mercenary welcome.
[180:35.35]Have you come to kill me as you've killed my followers?
[180:38.89]I'll take that PDA of yours.
[180:40.67]That contact list on it should prove handy.
[180:43.95]Oh, I have to be flashy about it.
[181:04.25]Okay, that was a little much.
[181:08.57]Somebody said that was not aggressive?
[181:10.28]I threw the guy off a cliff.
[181:12.26]Oh no, it's Iron Man, and there's two associates!
[181:34.76]All three of them are dead.
[181:38.64]Mike.
[181:39.76]Mike, can you hear me?
[181:41.67]Yeah.
[181:43.07]In stereo.
[181:45.23]Mina?
[181:48.25]Mike, you need to get up and get out of here.
[181:50.51]I would be pretty aggravated.
[181:52.57]Your bedside manner sucks.
[181:56.84]Mina, I found Shahid.
[181:59.22]He's still talking with that load.
[182:01.66]Man, what the hell is going on here?
[182:04.24]Three missiles just hit my fucking area, dude.
[182:06.60]Damn.
[182:07.04]Can't believe that.
[182:08.64]Conspiracy.
[182:25.99]And whoever it is, fed them the coordinates for the missile strike.
[182:28.71]Anger.
[182:29.85]So then, I come back there and kick someone's ass until I get a confession?
[182:35.77]He's so unenthusiastic.
[182:37.05]I don't think it's that easy.
[182:39.13]I should have guessed.
[182:39.93]This guy is just Shadow the Hedgehog, but in human form.
[182:44.51]That's why no one knows I'm talking to you right now.
[182:47.77]Mina, why did you cut Westridge off?
[182:49.17]By the way, don't have access to the controller, so I couldn't choose an option.
[182:51.19]Because I picked up the missile walk-on before anyone else.
[182:53.07]There wasn't time to ask him.
[182:55.24]Why?
[182:55.96]You're assigned to Saudi.
[182:57.28]You're currently my only contact with Alpha Protocol.
[183:00.20]And now we're having a very one-sided conversation.
[183:03.08]I'm trying to help you, Mike.
[183:05.11]Fine.
[183:05.97]So I need to get back to base.
[183:07.53]Can you get any choppers out?
[183:09.31]The hedgehog.
[183:10.31]Mike, you can't come back.
[183:11.79]I have guns, too.
[183:13.19]You're rogue.
[183:14.39]Why am I rogue?
[183:16.25]What did I do that was wrong?
[183:19.45]If they find you, they'll give you up to the government.
[183:22.87]If they don't kill you first...
[183:25.99]Wait, what about Alpha Protocol?
[183:28.45]That's what the agency is for.
[183:30.21]To allow agents to carry out ops like this.
[183:33.29]It's to allow the government to deny ops like this.
[183:36.66]So that if they're exposed, they can say they had no involvement.
[183:39.94]Oh, no.
[183:40.74]What just happened?
[183:41.36]What did I do?
[183:41.68]What?
[183:41.92]What?
[183:42.18]What?
[183:42.42]What?
[183:45.76]It just skipped the whole thing and he sprinted.
[183:49.61]Whatever.
[183:49.99]Here are your stats.
[183:56.63]Got 422 damage.
[183:59.59]My Wi-Fi connection is pretty all over the place.
[184:08.76]I killed the guy I needed.
[184:09.92]Oh.
[184:11.42]I'm still analyzing the information I got from Shahid.
[184:14.14]Never take off my sunglasses and never take off a backwards hat inside.
[184:20.56]I'm like the worst of the worst.
[184:22.67]Looks that way.
[184:24.35]But what worries me is why.
[184:27.07]According to this, Halbeck's got three targets.
[184:30.06]Taipei, Rome, and Moscow.
[184:34.72]Transmitting the information now.
[184:36.42]Looks like the missiles were shipped through Moscow.
[184:39.12]Oh, my internet!
[184:40.98]What's going on?
[184:43.59]Oh, my internet is dying right now.
[184:46.81]Oh, no.
[184:47.19]Guys, if I lose connection, I'm so sorry.
[184:48.95]Oh, no.
[184:49.25]I think we're gone.
[184:50.03]Uh-oh.
[184:50.21]Can anybody hear me?
[185:03.90]Shit well I think yeah, I think people can hear me right now Yeah, I'm gonna wait like a minute or so here, but I'm sorry if this goes out then Sorry, we'll play off a protocol again.
[185:18.39]I'm actually having a good time.
[185:19.29]So This sucks what the hell why we've been going strong for like over three hours I
[185:33.09]That's annoying.
[185:36.11]Um... Yeah, this is... We have to sit here for a little while.
[185:44.91]Give me a minute.
[185:46.61]If not, if we die right here, then I'm really sorry.
[185:48.83]I'll see you guys on Thursday if we die here.
[185:52.47]And... At that point, we'll probably be doing some potential light gun stuff.
[186:00.24]If not...
[186:02.11]Then you'll see that stuff on Friday.
[186:04.13]Octageddon comes out on Friday too.
[186:05.70]God damn it.
[186:06.62]We were like just getting into it too.
[186:08.48]This shit's so annoying.
[186:11.68]I was planning on going for like at least five hours today.
[186:13.78]This is so fucking irritating.
[186:14.98]I'm going to give it like another minute and then we're going to have to call it unfortunately.
[186:21.06]I need to drink some more water.
[186:34.47]Don't stop bel- yeah, it might just die here.
[186:38.01]So again, goodnight.
[186:40.54]Goodbye.
[186:41.10]If the stream turns off, like, for so- it keeps going to 0k up for me.
[186:46.28]So that means that the stream might just completely turn off.
[186:49.34]So, I'm sorry that we have to end so abruptly.
[187:12.75]God damn it.
[187:15.86]I'm still barely live.
[187:17.06]I keep going down to like 10k up.
[187:19.72]That's not good.
[187:27.20]Yeah, I'm gonna read bits.
[187:31.47]We'll read some bits for a little while and see what happens.
[187:36.29]Or maybe we won't.
[187:42.88]Am I still live?
[187:43.48]I think so.
[187:59.75]I think we have enough internet to just talk.
[188:03.35]So I'm going to turn off this and just stay at a black screen and see if I can save my bitrate to just do voice.
[188:13.43]Let me just put that on the screen so people know.
[188:25.23]Like that.
[188:30.24]Just so people know that this is what they're supposed to be seeing.
[188:38.42]Yeah, even on my browser, I'm slow as shit.
[188:43.44]Alright, well, thank you to... Let's do some bits.
[188:46.75]Good night.
[188:48.77]I'm going to get cut off every fucking five seconds from this.
[188:53.85]We're going to go.
[188:54.45]I'm going to read bits until the stream don't work no more.
[189:01.86]Apple Cooler, thanks for the $1.

[189:15.07]This is going to be a fun stream.
[189:16.65]I had a lot of fun.
[189:17.85]I like this game.
[189:21.25]That has enough interesting things going on.
[189:23.61]I'm having a good time.

[189:48.62]Well, like, heh heh.
[189:51.06]Is that a new thing?
[189:54.41]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[189:57.19]I've been gone for months.
[189:58.19]Please tell me the rats meme isn't banned.
[190:00.21]No.
[190:01.95]It was just the stuff that was in the box from 2017.
[190:06.97]And a couple others that I just... Not every single thing I've ever said is... Just those specific things from 2017.
[190:15.54]And guess what?
[190:19.18]Like, they're in jail, right?
[190:20.72]Well, no, a lot of them are dead.
[190:21.98]But, like, you know, some of them are in jail.
[190:24.64]And they'll get released on parole.
[190:26.80]If they're good.
[190:27.49]If they're on good behavior.
[190:32.37]But thank you, Command Rabbit, for the $1.
[190:33.71]Did you see the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launch?
[190:38.40]I did not.
[190:40.14]I did not.
[190:42.12]I'll check it out.
[190:44.37]Albert McMull, thanks for the $1.
[190:46.17]Jerma, have you thought about playing the Mad Max game that came out a couple years ago?
[190:49.31]I think it's a mage you would like.
[190:52.37]Game?
[190:52.97]Game.
[190:55.45]You know, I have looked at it.
[190:58.19]But every review I read said it was kind of just like a generic third-person shooter that didn't really do much.
[191:04.33]But there is a car in it, though.
[191:05.69]There are cars, so that might mean something.
[191:12.61]I'll give it a look again.
[191:14.09]Thank you, though, Albert.
[191:14.75]Appreciate it.
[191:16.92]Spirit Snail, thanks for the $1.
[191:18.44]Hi, Jermo.
[191:19.52]Are you ever going to play with Boo again?
[191:20.92]I miss his golden voice.
[191:23.66]Um...
[191:25.94]I'm not sure.
[191:26.88]Me and Boo, we talk like from time to time.
[191:29.48]I think kind of just he's kind of doing his own thing now.
[191:36.43]We're, you know, it's not like we're on like bad terms or anything.
[191:40.45]If I happen to see him, I usually, if I see him around, it's like, hey, there's Boo.
[191:45.11]But, you know, he is a really, really swell man.
[191:53.18]But thank you for the $1 Sprint Snail.
[192:00.56]Thank you for the $1 to Hydra.
[192:04.56]Streamer complains about food and pee-pee-poo-poos his pants.
[192:09.78]Mm-hmm.
[192:11.08]Yes.
[192:12.42]Sometimes.
[192:12.92]Sometimes we pee-pee-poo-poo.
[192:16.69]DragonBreath75, thanks for the $1.
[192:18.65]Hi, streamer BaldBoyBaby.
[192:20.35]I just remembered that tomorrow is my birthday.
[192:21.95]Can you please send me a cake covered in Jermas?
[192:27.89]Sure.
[192:29.85]I will, like, shrink myself down.
[192:31.43]Honey, I shrunk the kid's style and clone myself a hundred times.
[192:35.38]And then I'll just dump them on your cake.
[192:37.72]But then that's fucked up because you like eating people.
[192:39.54]You don't want to eat a... You want to eat, like... You want to be a cannibal?
[192:41.79]I don't know about that, dragon.
[192:43.67]Happy birthday, though.
[192:44.53]Happy birthday tomorrow.
[192:46.93]D Jack, thanks for the $1.
[192:48.23]I had some real fun recently going through some of the later videos on your main channel, like NeuroStory ElectroDump.
[192:54.05]It's been a fun ride, and I'm sure I'm not alone in saying it's been amazing to watch you and your humor evolve.
[192:59.19]You're a really great and unique entertainer, and I can't wait for your future content.
[193:01.72]Thank you, D Jack.
[193:03.36]Thank you so much.
[193:05.27]Well, when you speak about evolving, 2018 is kind of what you're describing.
[193:10.69]I hope you guys enjoy it.
[193:11.97]We're kind of going to mishmash live and scripted kind of video content together in the same realm.
[193:19.25]I feel like it's the most adapted course of action.
[193:22.39]And if it works, it works.
[193:23.33]If it doesn't, then at least it tried.
[193:26.15]But thank you.
[193:26.57]Appreciate it.
[193:28.31]Shlabaza, thanks for the $1.
[193:29.27]Are you going to stream Shadow of the Colossus after Light Gun?
[193:32.18]It looks amazing.
[193:33.00]I love Shadow of the Colossus.
[193:35.79]I played Shadow of the Colossus a long time ago.
[193:39.91]It's great.
[193:41.51]It's just bosses the video game and it's very beautiful.
[193:44.05]The soundtrack is awesome.
[193:47.30]But I don't know, maybe.
[193:50.40]I'm not like a big fan of playing a game that I've already played through completely and I know everything about because I can't really...
[194:00.16]There's no real reactions to anything.
[194:03.44]I'm not like seeing things for the first time.
[194:05.40]I'm kind of just going through the game again, but this time on camera.
[194:09.64]So I'm not sure I would stream the new Shadow of the Colossus.
[194:16.81]But maybe I would check it out just to see what's changed or what's different.
[194:24.12]But I'm not like really, that's the same reason why I haven't played Bloodborne on stream.
[194:27.79]Because I've beaten Bloodborne, it's like six times.
[194:32.15]And at that point, it's like, okay, so I know exactly what's going on here.
[194:35.69]Yeah, I remember beating this guy.
[194:37.41]This is kind of cool.
[194:38.16]Over here is an item.
[194:39.36]You get this item, like, I'm not like a speed runner.
[194:41.50]I'm not like, it's not one of those situations where you're going to watch me play the game really well, super fast or something.
[194:47.12]It's just me playing a game I've already beaten a bunch of times and me just kind of being on camera this time.
[194:53.51]But if enough people want me to do it, I would absolutely do it.
[194:56.18]We'll cross that bridge when we crossed it, right?
[194:58.64]You know, I thank you, dude.
[195:01.28]Thank you, Jake Sunshine for the 10 bucks.
[195:04.34]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching you for years now and I love you, man.
[195:06.73]I don't think my sense of humor would be the same without you.
[195:10.49]Thank you.
[195:12.98]Thank you for sticking around for years.
[195:15.82]And I'm glad you enjoy hanging out here and you think the dumb shit I say is fun.
[195:25.89]Thank you, Jake.
[195:28.25]Hopefully in the future there'll be more for you to watch.
[195:31.35]I hope.
[195:32.93]What do I mean I hope?
[195:34.39]Of course there will be.
[195:36.41]Thank you, Stix Renegade.
[195:37.71]Stix again.
[195:38.31]Hey, for the $1, what's your favorite shotgun and why is it the Winchester Model 1887 lever action?
[195:45.46]No, my favorite kind of shotgun is actually just a, the straight up old school buckshot with the two shells that you close.
[195:56.12]Just boom.
[195:57.50]That's my favorite kind of shotgun.
[195:59.95]That old school handle cracks in half and you put the two shells in and close it.
[196:05.87]You know what?
[196:06.55]It ain't even about the gun.
[196:07.45]It's about the closing mechanism.
[196:08.91]That close it is my favorite part.
[196:14.34]But yeah, there you go.
[196:16.60]Comcast Customer Care.
[196:17.68]Hey, Comcast Customer Care.
[196:19.92]Thanks for the $5.
[196:22.18]Really like what you're doing to the stream right now.
[196:24.95]But thanks for the five bucks earlier.
[196:26.11]This game is like an off-brand Mass Effect, but it's actually a tasty off-brand.
[196:30.53]Well, it was made by Obsidian, so Obsidian is a good game company.
[196:35.23]They make good quality products.
[196:37.95]And do keep in mind this game did come out like more than 10 years ago now, right?
[196:45.13]So I think it's fun, but that's a good way to put it.
[196:49.49]Sean Vich, thanks for the $1.
[196:51.85]Jerba is King Fury confirmed.
[196:55.46]I don't know what that means, but thank you.
[196:59.89]Apple cooler again.
[197:00.53]Thanks for the $1.
[197:01.39]Angrily kick open your door or pre-recorded.
[197:05.33]No.
[197:07.21]This door is heavy, dude.
[197:08.55]I can't like kick this door open.
[197:12.11]If I kick this door right now, I'm going to break my ankle.
[197:14.53]This door weighs like 400 pounds.
[197:16.35]It's not even true.
[197:17.27]It's a lie.
[197:19.03]Thank you.
[197:19.31]Bake me home for the $1.
[197:20.31]Thanks for the thanks for the $1.
[197:21.69]Oh, no.
[197:24.88]I see.
[197:25.18]Thanks for the thanks for $1.
[197:26.60]Yeah, you got it, man.
[197:28.12]Thank you.
[197:30.26]Palasonic, thanks for the $25.
[197:31.36]25 bucks from Palasonic.
[197:36.07]Jeremiah, I first discovered you in like seventh grade, back when you were a living room set.
[197:41.85]Anyway, my computer broke in 2014, and I never got back into it.
[197:45.35]My friend sent me one of your videos the other day, and I'm so happy I've rediscovered you.
[197:49.73]At first, I was a little sad you quit TF2 and were inactive on YouTube, but this new direction you went with Twitch is pretty cool.
[197:55.64]I look forward to watching you play some games.
[197:58.48]I'm a broke-ass college student, so this is all I can give, but cheers.
[198:01.38]Hope it helps.
[198:04.13]That's incredibly generous.
[198:06.83]$25, Palasonic.
[198:07.69]Thank you.
[198:10.53]But that just, I think about that sometimes.
[198:12.99]It's kind of weird, but cool in a way that I've been doing this.
[198:19.50]A lot of you guys that have been here for a long time.
[198:25.88]It's been almost seven fucking years.
[198:29.68]That's crazy.
[198:32.61]I think if you've been around since the very beginning, when I first uploaded my first YouTube video on that channel, I was like 25, 26 years old.
[198:42.11]I was like a young boy.
[198:43.55]I was a little boy making videos.
[198:46.87]And almost like seven, six or seven years later, I was still here.
[198:51.86]And it, you know, it humbles me and surprises me every day.
[198:55.94]So thank you guys for sticking around for this long.
[199:00.97]Like seven years.
[199:03.75]Some of you guys, like you're talking about seventh grade.
[199:05.80]That's through high school into college.
[199:10.70]That is so humbling to think that somebody has been watching me since they were a teenager through into their like adult life.
[199:18.32]Thank you.
[199:20.02]It means a lot.
[199:22.04]Hopefully you stick around.
[199:27.88]I have inspired a new generation.
[199:30.04]I'm 25 and just hit affiliate.
[199:32.42]If I never saw you, I wouldn't be here.
[199:33.86]A little sparkle twinkle.
[199:38.95]Thank you.
[199:39.27]If you can use me as that inspiration, like I'm happy.
[199:44.73]That is so, that's so like grounding to hear somebody say that.
[199:51.43]And I never take that for granted ever.
[199:53.91]I hope everybody understands that.
[199:57.22]Been watching through high school all the way through college.
[200:01.46]Yeah.
[200:08.08]Fuck you're old and I'm old.
[200:10.52]You're never too old.
[200:12.10]You're never too old.
[200:14.56]That's not true.
[200:15.38]You're never too old for anything.
[200:18.40]Actually, well, hold on, that's not true.
[200:21.11]But hold on, what are you too old to do?
[200:23.01]Okay, I guess you're too old
[200:25.97]to get on the ride that like babies go on at the carnival.
[200:29.75]But are you though?
[200:30.65]I think I've done that.
[200:32.46]I've gone on like the baby ride as a joke.
[200:35.50]I mean, was I too old for that?
[200:37.14]Maybe.
[200:39.14]Okay.
[200:39.54]What are you too old for?
[200:44.07]Drinking milk out of a bottle?
[200:46.63]No, I mean, that like nipple on the top of the bottle can be very, very convenient.
[200:50.25]Because what if you fall asleep drinking something out of the top?
[200:52.89]It's not going to spill.
[200:54.50]I don't think you're too old to drink out of a bottle.
[200:56.34]You're sitting there.
[200:57.62]What if you drop it?
[200:58.95]That's pretty... It has a lot of applications.
[201:06.39]Too old to go to school.
[201:07.29]That's not true.
[201:08.47]There are a lot of people that get held back for a couple of years.
[201:12.56]A lot of people that are still in college and they're like mid-30s.
[201:16.70]No.
[201:21.52]Not much.
[201:25.32]You're too old to go on the baby swing set?
[201:27.00]That's also not true.
[201:30.22]You can go swing on the baby swing set, but you're going to break it and you're going to have to owe somebody money.
[201:33.60]You know how many big, dumb, drunk, fat guys I've seen, jokingly, fat guy gets on that's an adult onto the baby swing and it breaks and everybody laughs?
[201:45.04]That's happened like five times in my life.
[201:47.52]I can pinpoint each of those occasions where that happened.
[201:55.69]Too old to be breastfed.
[202:01.25]Okay, alright.
[202:02.97]Now we're getting into the weeds here.
[202:05.46]I was making a couple of dumb references.
[202:07.64]We're getting into the weeds.
[202:08.76]We're going to move on.
[202:09.48]Thank you.
[202:12.42]Thank you to Palasonic for the 25 bucks.
[202:18.10]Combine.
[202:18.84]Thanks for the $1.
[202:19.26]Wicked pisser.
[202:22.11]That is a Boston terminology.
[202:25.30]I never say that.
[202:27.78]I don't like pissa.
[202:28.96]Who says that?
[202:31.91]I don't say that word, pissa.
[202:32.99]That's dumb.
[202:34.51]It's not dumb.
[202:35.23]If somebody probably says that and thinks it's cool, that's fine.
[202:44.11]I just keep thinking about it.
[202:45.05]I keep thinking about like a fucking adult.
[202:48.44]I can't even, I got, oh my God, I get this guy.
[202:50.42]I have to get this image out of my head.
[202:52.68]It's going to be there all day.
[202:53.54]I'm going to wake up.
[202:54.10]I'm going to have a nightmare about this.
[202:59.43]Thank you to Ragharnoy for the $5.
[203:02.55]Jerma kills the memes and instantly after the DAO crashes and all the cryptocurrencies almost die, except Ether.
[203:10.98]Coincidence?
[203:11.72]I think the jig is up.
[203:15.18]Ether tanked too, man.
[203:19.25]All of them did.
[203:20.43]I think they recovered a little bit today.
[203:21.73]Yeah, they did.
[203:23.21]There was a swell recovery in crypto today.
[203:26.77]But still.
[203:30.57]If you scroll down, I do take Ethereum.
[203:33.47]I'm not going to say that again.
[203:34.29]You guys already know.
[203:34.95]Everybody already knows that.
[203:36.49]That's why it's just buried at the bottom of my Twitch page.
[203:39.39]Because I want the one person that understands that space to scroll down and be like, oh, okay, cool.
[203:46.34]Here's a dollar.
[203:47.58]And then I can be like, oh, somebody did a transaction!
[203:50.66]Because I'm a weirdo and I think this stuff is cool.
[203:54.16]Too old for dabbing.
[203:55.23]No, you just look dumb.
[203:57.07]And it's really dumb for you to do that as an adult.
[203:59.33]You're not too old to dab.
[204:00.77]You just look real dumb doing it, and it's a stupid dance.
[204:10.62]Thank you, though.
[204:11.80]Thank you, Combine, again, for the $1.
[204:13.14]Also, Jeremy, will you ever play Half-Life 1 1⁄2?
[204:14.78]Oh, no, I think it's saying 1 or 2.
[204:18.08]No, those are games that I've also played a ton.
[204:20.37]I beat Half-Life 2.
[204:21.25]Ugh.
[204:24.56]I didn't beat all the episodes.
[204:25.58]Oh, did I?
[204:25.88]I don't even fucking remember.
[204:26.90]I beat Half-Life 1.
[204:29.44]Those games are just so old and so well known and everybody's played them and everybody knows everything that happens in those games that we would just simply be going through the motions while we talked about something.
[204:39.04]I don't think I've... I'd rather just... I'd rather experience new shit.
[204:47.14]Did I beat Episode 2?
[204:47.90]I don't even remember.
[204:48.84]I think I watched somebody do it.
[204:51.63]I don't know.
[204:53.87]But thank you to Biggie Brunswick for the $10.35.
[204:56.21]Thanks a lot, dude.
[204:58.93]I love you, Jerma.
[205:00.62]First of all, thank you.
[205:02.74]That's very, very kind of you.
[205:05.22]I've been watching your videos for as long as I can remember.
[205:07.88]One time I laughed so hard watching one of your videos that I almost puked on my desk.
[205:12.24]I always love looking through your old videos on your main channel and watching your streams to lighten up my day.
[205:17.44]Maybe could you give us a beer?
[205:19.32]My birthday is in a month, but I didn't want to wait that long to say how much you mean to me.
[205:23.58]Thank you, Brunswick.
[205:25.42]Biggie Brunswick.
[205:30.33]I have almost puked laughing at stuff in games on that channel.
[205:36.23]I don't puke when I laugh.
[205:38.39]I get a bad headache and I almost pass out.
[205:42.02]Not passing out from the laughing, but like, I get this extreme headache if I laugh really hard.
[205:47.63]I'm trying to think of the, probably like the, some of the GTA stuff.
[205:52.33]The Death to Spies did it to me.
[205:55.73]There's a few instances where I can remember it actually physically harming my body laughing at something in a game.
[206:03.45]But it was so worth it.
[206:05.39]That Death to Spies, that is my favorite video, I think.
[206:09.91]Now that I think about it completely.
[206:12.59]That game is absolute gold.
[206:16.63]I loved every second of playing in that game.
[206:22.84]But thank you for the incredibly kind words and the... obviously the monetary contribution here, Biggie.
[206:30.16]You want a beer?
[206:30.80]I could give you a beer.
[206:32.40]Let me... Sometimes you gotta warm up a little bit.
[206:43.42]You know, sometimes you gotta get to the throat here.
[206:49.06]Beer.
[206:50.02]Oh, fuck.
[206:50.40]I fucked it up.
[206:50.84]It's all good.
[206:53.42]If I didn't do too much of that, it would have been fine.
[206:55.30]Demon beer.
[206:58.88]Oh, he still got it.
[207:01.26]He still got it.
[207:05.08]Maybe sometimes he don't got it, but today is one of those days where he got it.
[207:11.24]You should sing a song like that.
[207:13.06]Be like fucking Tom Waits.
[207:20.85]Thank you, me, Double J, for the 30 cents.
[207:22.65]They say a meme that is not banned, but it's not allowed either, but it's allowed, but it's banned.
[207:28.85]Yeah.
[207:29.57]Thank you to Gabe DeGrossi for the $1.00.
[207:32.89]You took those guys out so silently.
[207:38.11]I'm pretty silent when I play games like this, except for... No, I'm not.
[207:42.47]That's a lie.
[207:42.91]I made it up.
[207:44.46]Thank you, though.
[207:45.22]Gabe DeGrossi.
[207:47.36]Bob Danko, thanks for the $1.
[207:50.80]They say nothing.
[207:52.90]Thank you, Bob.
[207:54.33]Gabe DeGrossi, again, thank you for...
[207:58.31]The one dollar here.
[207:59.81]Jerma's equivalent of stealth is explosions.
[208:05.62]They do an Etalyx emote.
[208:08.98]Yes.
[208:10.68]Because then nobody's around to tell the tale.
[208:13.38]The stealthiest way of all is nobody knows.
[208:16.26]Nobody knew you were there if the whole place gets destroyed.
[208:20.69]Eventually somebody finds out.
[208:21.73]If you slit somebody's throat sneaking around in a costume with night vision goggles on...
[208:27.61]Guess what?
[208:28.49]Eventually, when you sneak out, somebody's going to find that body eventually, even if it's the janitor.
[208:34.51]Destroying the whole building and everybody inside, that's the stealthiest way of all.
[208:38.92]Because there are no witnesses.
[208:41.64]There's nobody left.
[208:42.92]Complete and total silence after the fact.
[208:48.94]But thank you.
[208:51.90]And Atom, thanks for the $1.
[208:52.85]Snape...
[208:54.92]Try to retain the fundamentals of QCQ.
[209:01.86]Thank you to iNunPorter for the $1.
[209:05.23]And then eWertWert, twertytwert, gave $50, but he also gave a dollar back here.
[209:12.81]Replay LEGO Worlds, and also, when is The Stanley Parable stream?
[209:18.55]I'm just gonna play The Stanley Parable and do an entire recording of it and then play it on this stream at like times 100 speed.
[209:26.26]So the whole thing is done in like 28 seconds.
[209:31.88]And then if somebody really wants to, they can clip that portion of the stream, right?
[209:37.25]Because a clip on Twitch is what, a minute long?
[209:42.27]So you can clip that portion, save it, put it into a video editor, and reduce the speed by like 5,000%, and you'll have like a 20-minute Stanley Parable playthrough.
[209:55.45]That's the plan.
[210:00.53]Thank you to Ultraviolet, or Ultraviolent, for the $1.
[210:04.44]So this is basically just a Steven Seagal movie, right?
[210:09.08]Steven Seagal's a weird dude.
[210:14.11]Like, every one of his movies.
[210:16.71]He comes off as just off to me.
[210:20.23]I'm sure I'm not the only one that thinks that.
[210:23.56]Thank you to Gabe DeGrossi again for the $1.
[210:26.52]This is like a really, really, really bad Ghost Recon Wildlands.
[210:33.32]Well, it depends on how bad you mean, because Ghost Recon Wildlands is really bad.
[210:38.64]So if this is a really bad, really bad Ghost Recon Wildlands...
[210:44.21]You're getting towards ET.
[210:52.29]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[210:53.12]Hey, Jerma, long time watcher here.
[210:57.18]Been watching you since your first video where you were playing with the Dead Ringer on Pee Pee Poo Poo.
[211:06.56]Thanks, Pin.
[211:09.32]Look, Wildlands was fun.
[211:10.78]It was fun enough.
[211:11.58]There was like a bunch of funny shit to do in the cars.
[211:13.32]There was a lot of exploring.
[211:15.56]But it was just Far Cry with a different title.
[211:19.68]And look, they've made a fifth Far Cry is coming out here soon.
[211:24.12]So Wildlands was just Far Cry, but Far Cry already has like six games.
[211:35.51]I didn't hate my time in Wildlands.
[211:37.03]I didn't.
[211:42.88]But again, thank you to Ewert Wittertwirter for the 50 bucks.
[211:48.66]We covered it already, but thank you, dude.
[211:52.03]$50 from you.
[211:52.97]Much love.
[211:55.07]Cheese it up.
[211:55.79]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[211:56.75]Why won't you hydrate on camera?
[212:01.22]God.
[212:02.90]There's nothing.
[212:03.42]No, no, I'm not.
[212:04.38]No, I'm not doing that.
[212:05.30]I'm not participating in the new meme.
[212:09.20]I'm not going to participate.
[212:11.28]I refrain from participation.
[212:16.69]Thank you.
[212:16.97]Cheese it up, though.
[212:18.49]Your hydration bot told us to tell you to hydrate before you die.
[212:26.21]There you go.
[212:27.23]There.
[212:28.13]It's done.
[212:28.85]I'm hydrated.
[212:29.55]Well, I feel much better now.
[212:31.59]Glad I participated in the meme.
[212:34.82]Gabe Degrossi, thanks for the $1.
[212:36.07]Your character looks like the office jerk who decided to wear a giant croissant upside down on his neck.
[212:42.55]What?
[212:44.87]Thank you Internet Jorge for the five bucks.
[212:47.88]Erdemius89 for the bits, 50 cents here.
[212:50.16]You were really hard on yourself this stream.
[212:51.86]Be sure to take it easy.
[212:53.68]Also, I had to watch two ads for this, for his and hers lubricant.
[212:59.37]I hope it's worth it.
[213:01.55]Why are you getting like porno ads?
[213:04.37]Hard on myself this stream.
[213:05.43]I'm sure if I was just joking around.
[213:07.73]I was having a good time.
[213:08.55]This game was a lot of fun.
[213:09.49]I'm going to play it again.
[213:11.19]I was having a blast.
[213:14.31]Gabe Degrossi, thanks for the $1.
[213:15.71]Fruity Pebbles Wildlands.
[213:17.24]That's a pretty good title, actually.
[213:20.72]Sadelf.
[213:21.88]God damn it.
[213:22.76]Sadelf26, thanks for the $1.
[213:24.74]Hey, Dermot.
[213:25.18]I've been watching your content since very late 2011.
[213:28.14]Expect more money in the future.
[213:30.94]Love your shit, dude.
[213:32.52]Sad Elf.
[213:34.06]I really should just start calling you Sad Elf.
[213:40.52]I don't know why.
[213:42.08]I feel like I like Sad Elf.
[213:46.02]But under no obligation, Sad Elf, to give me any money.
[213:51.76]Thank you, though.
[213:52.40]I very much appreciate it.
[213:57.32]Reptilian God, thanks for the $1.
[213:58.94]Have you thought about playing Metal Gear Rising Revengeance?
[214:02.18]It's a really fun game with some fun mechanics.
[214:03.82]I think you'd like it.
[214:04.44]I think, I'm not sure if it was you, but I think a couple of people were telling me to play that game a long time ago.
[214:13.65]It's sort of hack and slashy, very action oriented, right?
[214:18.53]I actually have never given that game a proper look and I really probably should, but thanks dude.
[214:24.88]I'll give it a look again for like the third time maybe if I ever, it's pretty wild.
[214:30.89]Maybe we'll play it at some point.
[214:32.37]We got a lot of stuff going on the next two weeks.
[214:35.67]Like, I'm actually, at the end of this week, I'm going to have all the light gun stuff.
[214:39.53]It's just the reason why the light gun stuff is taking so long is because, man, you guys wouldn't believe how much of a pain in the ass it actually is to, like, get a big CRTV, like, CRT TV down here.
[214:52.36]A tube TV.
[214:53.02]One of those big fucking, like, 150-pound TVs.
[214:57.15]you can't play these old light gun games on any screen or TV or monitor that's been made in the last 10 years so it's a lot of like weird dumb that I have to figure out but it's all it's all going to be ready to go hopefully play vanquish one day maybe
[215:23.59]But thanks a lot, ReptilianGod.
[215:25.17]Potterfan, thanks for the $5.
[215:27.61]Jerma, can you clear this up?
[215:31.18]Clear what up?
[215:33.80]What am I clearing up here?
[215:36.46]O-W-O isn't either.
[215:37.48]You can't ban it.
[215:40.75]Yeah, but... Fuck, you're right.
[215:43.97]Okay, alright.
[215:44.49]Let's clear this up.
[215:45.77]So... I don't... I can't control what... Look, I can't control what anybody's going to say.
[215:52.33]Right?
[215:54.22]the kill the meme stream and meme funeral was to was to just put a stranglehold on some of the jokes from 2017 right that doesn't mean all references to anything I've ever done can never be said ever again we're just trying to clean up the house a little bit we're just trying to sweep some shit get it in the dumpster and we'll move on it's not I can't tell you old shit that I and here it comes
[216:28.95]Look, no one's actually, look, can we talk about the non-joke here?
[216:33.00]No one's actually going to get, like, banned from this channel if you make any, like, jokes.
[216:39.10]It's, uh, this is just, you, we're just, this is part of the joke.
[216:42.36]This is part of the, you gotta play along.
[216:45.39]If you don't play along, then, as you see, five seconds.
[216:53.51]And sometimes, five minutes.
[216:58.44]I can't prevent anybody from doing anything.
[217:00.22]Okay, like, if I really was banning people, like, for more, like, oh, yeah, you're banned from the channel because you said, like, coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[217:08.08]That's not going to fucking happen, right?
[217:10.58]But, like, obviously, it would just, we're letting it play out a little bit.
[217:14.84]We are all playing along.
[217:23.66]I love looking over here and just seeing, like, has been timed out for five seconds, has been banned for fucking a hundred seconds.
[217:30.74]It's part of the fucking, this is the new meme, okay?
[217:34.02]2018.
[217:34.98]A meta meme.
[217:37.06]Stronger than any meme you've ever seen before.
[217:39.14]It's a joke about getting rid of the old jokes and itself is its own joke.
[217:44.14]We've made a layer.
[217:45.34]There's like +2 defense on this one.
[217:49.42]Anyways.
[217:51.92]Thank you for the $5, dude.
[217:56.33]Sticks, Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[217:57.61]You know what meme you forgot to get rid of?
[217:59.41]Dabbing.
[218:00.93]Dabbing is a stupid dance move.
[218:04.66]It's not a meme.
[218:06.40]I can't get rid of it.
[218:08.06]That's like when Beyonce tried to delete that picture of her from the internet.
[218:13.46]And then guess what happened?
[218:16.55]It was everywhere.
[218:18.18]So if I was like, nah, I want to delete that picture of me dabbing, that shit's going to end up on the front page of the New York Times if I try to do that.
[218:29.07]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[218:31.91]Play JFK Reloaded.
[218:34.75]What the fuck is that?
[218:37.77]What is that short for?
[218:39.66]I have no idea.
[218:41.16]But thank you, Smelly Boy.
[218:43.50]DJ Emberman, thanks for the 75 cents.
[218:46.84]I gave 25 bits when you paid for that shitty celebrity voice app.
[218:51.48]And I need to even it out to a multiple of 100 bits.
[218:56.34]Or I'll piss me.
[218:57.10]It'll piss me off.
[218:57.96]Also, it's my birthday.
[218:58.74]Happy birthday, DJ Emberman.
[219:04.23]Oh, it's like a fucked up.
[219:05.77]I'm not going to play that game.
[219:09.59]No, I don't like play, look, I don't play like fucking offensive fucking games on this stream.
[219:18.10]You know what I mean?
[219:18.60]Like, you want me to like go play that game?
[219:22.43]What?
[219:24.53]What happens to like this channel if I, why would I, I'm not going to do that.
[219:37.25]You played WWE.
[219:38.65]Why was WWE like an offensive game?
[219:41.10]Oh, it's offensive.
[219:42.84]I'm offended by that.
[219:44.14]I'm just offended by it.
[219:45.94]Stop offending me.
[219:50.27]But I played the aquarium game for five hours.
[219:52.79]It's a game where you feed fish.
[219:59.32]I played Alpha Protocol.
[220:01.18]Alpha Protocol is not a simulation where you murder... No, I'm not gonna even... We're not even gonna... Just stop offending me, okay?
[220:11.57]I'm getting quite offended by this.
[220:13.09]Alright, thanks.
[220:19.15]Let's go.
[220:19.71]Let's go.
[220:20.35]Move on.
[220:21.09]Move on.
[220:24.01]Let's get out of here.
[220:25.07]Get out of this, like, fucking tunnel we've gotten into here.
[220:31.97]Thank you to Convo Breaker for the $1.
[220:35.89]Death Despise Extreme Body Sliders, the full section of the original instance of the Clip It joke, and Dictation Disaster.
[220:44.16]All of a very, very real possibility of actually killing me.
[220:47.78]They're so fucking funny, I mean it so much that one of them actually nearly killed me in my sleep.
[220:53.66]I love Jerma.
[220:54.56]Please keep the attempts at my murder coming.
[220:56.85]I enjoy it.
[220:57.63]Jesus.
[221:00.30]um yeah those are I I do have a very very uh large place in my heart for every video I've pretty much ever made every video every stream I've had like a very I got a large heart and the sections there's different rooms and each room is a different video and stream this is like a 5 000 room hotel room in here
[221:26.74]I mean, I gotta say, I gotta make room for, like, friends and family and stuff, too.
[221:29.20]There's, like, there's lots of places to sleep here in the jermaHeart Hotel.
[221:34.50]But thank you.
[221:35.88]I appreciate that.
[221:37.70]I'm gonna just keep doing it.
[221:40.60]Who knows?
[221:41.30]I don't know.
[221:41.64]I can't predict what the next thing I'm gonna do is.
[221:44.88]Sometimes I just come up with something that I like to try, or sometimes even you guys come up with things that would be fun to do, and that's how we do it here.
[221:51.61]It's a community effort.
[221:53.33]Thank you.
[221:54.97]Crunchy Jester, thanks for the $1.
[221:57.11]Gabe DeGrossi, again, thanks for the $5.
[221:58.75]I have to say, your spy party videos killed me.
[222:03.06]I brought it the other day.
[222:05.36]Oh, I bought it the other day, and it's so funny.
[222:07.12]Will you ever go back?
[222:09.68]Yeah, Spy Party was a weird game because Spy Party was in development for, like, so long that every update they did was super tiny, but they did, like, a dozen and a half of them.
[222:20.71]Like, they did, like, 15 updates to that game or something in, like, three years or, like, two years.
[222:26.59]And they just eventually got to, like, full 3D graphics.
[222:30.41]It's been such a long time that I'm not even sure what that game's like now.
[222:35.38]I'm curious.
[222:35.92]I want to, like, look at that after the stream, but maybe, Gabe.
[222:38.58]Thank you.
[222:40.23]Mostly lost thanks to the $5.
[222:41.33]Do you ever see yourself streaming more GTA?
[222:44.03]I first discovered you through your hysterical GTA 4 videos and would love to see you revisit it.
[222:48.43]Maybe when GTA 6 comes out.
[222:49.93]Oh my god.
[222:51.71]I'm going to play the absolute hell out of GTA 6 whenever that comes out.
[222:57.37]But it's funny you say that because we were actually about to play the new heist update tonight instead of Alpha Protocol.
[223:06.48]So GTA is pretty much always on the menu.
[223:11.26]It's always that game that you can play, especially when they come up with an update.
[223:14.87]Red Dead Redemption 2 is another one.
[223:16.33]Of course, we played through the whole thing and the DLC of the first one.
[223:20.55]So I'm absolutely going to play through the whole thing in the second one too.
[223:26.21]But yes, you can expect whatever GTA comes out next.
[223:29.38]You'll see it.
[223:31.66]Based Shark.
[223:32.52]Thank you, Based One Shark for the $1.
[223:34.30]Jerma, have you thought about playing Breath of the Wild since you recently got the Switch?
[223:38.56]I don't own a Switch.
[223:40.04]That was Etalyx' Switch that he brought over to hang out.
[223:43.86]And we played on his Switch.
[223:45.28]I don't have one.
[223:48.20]But I probably will get one soon.
[223:54.20]I was gonna get it for Mario Odyssey because that game is crazy.
[223:58.91]But let me just burp onto my breath real quick and make it so nobody heard it.
[224:05.23]But I... You know, Zelda is a touchy subject for me here.
[224:11.62]Because we've talked about Zelda.
[224:12.84]We've talked about how I don't like... With that cry guy video is what I just did.
[224:19.46]Um... Well... How do I say this?
[224:26.12]How do I say this?
[224:28.01]Well... Yeah...
[224:35.07]To be determined.
[224:37.43]I'm not going to say anything bad about Zelda.
[224:39.07]We had a Zelda conversation for like 40 minutes one time.
[224:42.41]Not my cup of tea.
[224:43.17]There you go.
[224:43.63]Perfect.
[224:46.97]You stop right there.
[224:48.93]I don't hate it.
[224:49.57]What?
[224:49.85]He hates it.
[224:50.49]What are you talking about?
[224:51.25]I just played Zelda.
[224:57.82]I played the original one for the regular Nintendo.
[225:01.30]Remember, I'm old.
[225:02.78]I'm a lot older than a lot of you guys here.
[225:05.90]I played My Zelda.
[225:07.72]My Zelda was the first one for Nintendo Entertainment System.
[225:13.82]And then I played Link to the Past.
[225:16.24]And then Ocarina of Time came out, and what a wonderful experience that was.
[225:21.89]One of the greatest.
[225:23.17]Masterpiece.
[225:24.77]Oh, it was great.
[225:27.25]And then Majora's Mask followed soon after.
[225:29.95]Whew!
[225:31.88]Wow, time, you got like, you only have like a certain amount of time to beat the game?
[225:35.22]Fucking crazy, awesome, revolutionary.
[225:38.82]Even.
[225:40.94]Man, was that cool.
[225:43.36]Once you got to the Wii.
[225:45.91]Nah, Twilight Princess, I hated it.
[225:48.65]I hated Twilight Princess.
[225:49.99]I'm sorry, I did.
[225:51.95]I did, it just, I don't, I didn't like it.
[225:53.63]I did not like it at all.
[225:57.01]The dog, the thing with the dog, I just, I don't like the dog.
[225:59.87]I didn't like the dog part.
[226:04.04]I'm sorry.
[226:05.64]I'm sorry that I'm making somebody angry right now.
[226:07.93]But I did not like Twilight Princess.
[226:12.25]And then, hold on here.
[226:13.75]Hold on a second.
[226:15.59]That one when you played the four different popsicles?
[226:18.29]The four different popsicle links?
[226:20.13]What was it called?
[226:20.63]The four swords?
[226:21.63]The four swordsmen?
[226:22.40]The four horsemen?
[226:23.86]The Legend of Zelda link is the four horsemen.
[226:27.08]Whatever it was.
[226:28.00]That was great.
[226:28.52]I loved that one.
[226:29.28]What was it called?
[226:32.54]What was that game called?
[226:40.69]The Four Swords.
[226:41.40]Yeah, okay.
[226:42.68]That was cool.
[226:44.42]That was a really, really fun game.
[226:46.30]It was very interesting.
[226:48.78]Then you got to the more... Then you got to the sword one.
[226:51.56]What was it called?
[226:52.50]The Skyward Sword.
[226:55.08]Didn't even play that one.
[226:57.05]Didn't play that one for... Sorry, Wind Waker.
[226:59.11]Wind Waker was great.
[227:00.05]Let's go back.
[227:01.19]Rewind about six years or so.
[227:04.21]Wind Waker...
[227:06.91]I would be in the audience clapping if that came onto a TV screen.
[227:09.54]Oh, like, great, awesome, cool.
[227:12.30]Skyward Sword didn't even play it.
[227:14.74]It was a gimmick to me.
[227:18.00]It was like, let's use the Wii mode as gimmicky as we can.
[227:20.50]Nah, didn't even play it.
[227:25.50]And then it brings us kind of to the present day.
[227:29.84]I just, I don't, I'm not like a huge Zelda fan, but I respect and appreciate...
[227:35.93]Every single one of them.
[227:37.33]I didn't personally like Twilight Princess, but huskies are so cute.
[227:42.26]I love going to the front page of RR.
[227:44.86]And my god, do you see that husky with the different colored eyes?
[227:48.34]Oh my god, he's great.
[227:49.65]I respect that.
[227:50.49]I do.
[227:52.75]Just didn't really click with me.
[228:03.01]I don't like Zelda and by that I just mean Twilight Princess.
[228:06.13]No, I think like, okay, look, we're gonna get really into this here and I don't mean to, like we're about to turn the stream off on my like fucking 500K upstream that's still here.
[228:17.65]But so after playing Dark Souls and games that are like that, Dark Souls is my Zelda.
[228:30.22]When you go back to Zelda after playing, this is just my opinion, this is just for me.
[228:34.98]Playing a game like Dark Souls, which is essentially like the more interesting version of Zelda for me.
[228:44.69]The leveling up, the collecting, the if you die, you lose everything, the difficulty.
[228:50.29]I feel like that Dark Souls is my Legend of Zelda.
[228:55.26]That's just my opinion.
[228:58.89]The Zelda of Dark Souls.
[229:04.01]Breath of the Wild is Dark Souls.
[229:12.98]But they're totally different.
[229:13.98]No, no, no, but I'm just saying like that like adventure, like action adventure games where you have a sword or a weapon that you swing at stuff and you have to dodge and lock on
[229:26.85]I would rather play Dark Souls than play Zelda.
[229:30.81]Because I feel like there's more at stake when you play a game like Dark Souls versus Zelda.
[229:35.53]I know they're different games, but hopefully that can make any sense to anybody.
[229:42.77]Zelda is not an RPG.
[229:44.31]I know, but still, it's like an action-adventure game.
[229:48.45]I'm not saying that Zelda's just like Dark Souls.
[229:50.47]I'm saying that Dark Souls is the Zelda to me.
[229:54.00]I would rather play that.
[230:02.84]Witcher 3, now Witcher 3 and Dark Souls aren't, like, I can't put them in the same category.
[230:06.45]No more game comparison.
[230:07.59]Zelda sucks!
[230:09.19]It's the worst fucking game series ever.
[230:11.39]You got it out of me, okay?
[230:13.05]Oh god, oh, it's like a fucking green Kermit the Frog kid that spins around and screams and every single game is so easy you could close your fucking eyes and beat it.
[230:26.24]Made for fucking children.
[230:32.10]He's got a stupid fucking princess friend.
[230:35.14]I'm kidding.
[230:42.12]I'm kidding.
[230:42.66]That's a joke.
[230:43.24]That's a joke.
[230:43.90]Zelda's a great series.
[230:45.40]Don't take me out of context.
[230:46.62]Don't burn me down.
[230:48.10]Get out of here.
[230:49.28]Don't ever, don't you ever hold that flame in front of me.
[230:56.61]The thing is like, even though I'm just fucking around and making a joke,
[231:01.13]Somebody's gonna hear that clip out of context and they're gonna be so fucking angry with me.
[231:07.34]They're gonna think I'm like a dick and like, yeah, don't, make sure they see.
[231:12.08]I was kidding around.
[231:14.12]It was just a joke.
[231:15.86]Zelda is my like childhood.
[231:17.70]I like love that series.
[231:21.14]It just fucking sucks.
[231:24.93]Hey, thanks you, thanks you.
[231:27.15]Thanks Orc and Beard for the $1.00.
[231:30.12]Now, I gotta see how this sounds out of context.
[231:31.78]Does this sound jokey?
[231:32.75]Let's make sure it does.
[231:35.37]Zelda sucks!
[231:36.93]It's the worst fucking game series ever.
[231:39.15]You got it out of me, okay?
[231:40.81]Oh god, oh.
[231:41.59]It's like a fucking green Kermit the Frog kid that spins around and screams.
[231:46.78]And every single game is so easy, you can close your fucking eyes and beat it.
[231:53.26]Oh, no, that doesn't sound... Made for fucking children!
[231:55.92]No, that's not good.
[231:57.28]You don't say that.
[231:58.36]You don't say that.
[232:00.04]I confided the unforgivable sin.

[232:40.76]I just got back into them.
[232:41.56]They held up extremely well and could make for a great stream.
[232:45.12]I played the first Descent ever on the first PC I ever had in my house.
[232:50.86]I just didn't understand it.
[232:52.26]I was too young.
[232:53.08]I was just an idiot.
[232:53.96]I just was flying around and shit.
[232:58.92]I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
[233:00.10]It was a 3D game.
[233:03.94]I'm afraid because I can't beat Breath of the Wild.
[233:07.06]No, I'm sure that game is awesome.
[233:09.00]An open world Zelda game?
[233:10.46]Like, how can you go wrong?
