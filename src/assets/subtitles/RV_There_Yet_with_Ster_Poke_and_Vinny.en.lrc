[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.98]I liked it.
[00:05.54]I thought it was a great idea.
[00:06.99]That's what you're supposed to talk about on Thanksgiving is someone's report card.
[00:11.14]True though.
[00:16.96]um well apparently Vinny has to host because his stuff never works wait we'll try this time maybe it'll work if you post star
[00:24.80]You're the most, like, you're very good at hosting.
[00:29.36]Why?
[00:29.68]Because I do it?
[00:31.31]You are good at it, so you should do it.
[00:33.74]Yeah, you know what, sir?
[00:34.34]You do it.
[00:35.60]Also, it's RV there yet.
[00:44.94]Yeah, we tend to play games where we're on road trips, which makes me think genuinely one day we should take a road trip to the Clown Motel.
[00:54.40]Oh yeah, I forgot about the clan motel.
[01:00.42]Wow.
[01:00.48]I would hope you forgot about that um geez no we wanted to do when I was in Vegas I was like guys we got to go to the clown motel
[01:09.03]And it was like eight hours away.
[01:10.53]So obviously that's for next time.
[01:17.96]It's real hard to host the game and invite people when no one ever wants to appear online.
[01:22.09]Oh, shit.
[01:22.41]I'm here.
[01:22.77]I'm online.
[01:23.66]What's up, dog?
[01:24.32]Am I not online?
[01:25.37]Yeah, I mean, you're the only one.
[01:27.08]What?
[01:27.86]I'm usually the one who's not online.
[01:29.89]No, it's usually all of you.
[01:32.22]I'm online.
[01:32.88]It's usually please host the game.
[01:34.27]Where is the game?
[01:36.01]And then no person is online.
[01:37.78]I'm good for an invite.
[01:39.53]Yo, am I in twice?
[01:41.59]You hear me twice, Ster?
[01:42.74]I don't know.
[01:46.93]I'm tapped out.
[01:49.52]let me know if you guys can hear me in game is this an in-game mic one or is this an out game mic one in game mic in game mic one part two okay
[01:59.68]My mouse sensitivity is... Let's all try and communicate, but we'll mute each other.
[02:03.17]Okay, well, we'll mute it again.
[02:07.42]Okay, toggle to talk?
[02:16.18]Uh-uh.
[02:17.66]We might be on the wrong microphone.
[02:19.86]We may.
[02:20.30]I definitely have.
[02:25.34]That's what I'm looking for, immersive.
[02:29.76]Should I keep it?
[02:32.59]No.
[02:33.98]Okay, I have to restart the game apparently.
[02:42.16]Hold on.
[02:51.35]Da-da-da-da-da-da.

[03:38.73]Could I get another invite?
[03:39.94]I had to, uh, restart the game.
[03:47.56]I don't know if he heard me.
[03:49.45]Maybe I can just join off him.

[04:31.70]Can you hear me?
[04:33.28]Shit.
[04:34.89]It's a bit louder than poke, so I don't hear poke.
[04:37.22]Alright, but you can hear me though.
[04:40.05]Yeah.
[04:40.67]Okay, good.

[05:01.60]Okay, so now it'll be easier.
[05:06.64]Quit fucking around!
[05:08.69]What are you doing to me?
[05:12.47]Stop grabbing me.
[05:13.70]Oh no.
[05:14.92]No, don't do that.
[05:16.77]Wait, we can do a pickup train?
[05:18.86]You're hurting my eyes.
[05:22.01]What the fuck?
[05:23.99]Hold on.
[05:28.55]Ow!
[05:29.50]That almost killed us.
[05:30.52]That dealt damage.
[05:33.85]Alright, so how do we play?
[05:37.06]We have to drive the car, right?
[05:38.27]I got you.
[05:40.66]Alright, are you guys ready?
[05:42.43]Are we good?
[05:43.01]Everybody sounds good?
[05:43.91]Everybody ready to play?
[05:45.14]I am... FUCKING LIT!
[05:48.88]Alright, so...
[05:51.69]We can smoke cigarettes and shit.
[05:54.75]I can't hear Vinny if he's talking.
[05:58.49]Why are we so small?
[05:59.33]I can't hear Vinny if he's talking.
[06:01.84]Wait, can you hear me, guys?
[06:02.97]Oh, now we can.
[06:03.55]I can hear you now.
[06:04.54]Ah, fuck.
[06:05.04]That whole time I was muted.
[06:06.94]Oh.
[06:07.37]Put me in the van.
[06:13.01]I am almost dead.
[06:22.30]Burger pack.
[06:24.11]Wait, do we need to bring this shit with us?
[06:26.07]Wait, I can't hear Jerma if he's talking.
[06:28.06]No, I'm... Yeah, Jerma, you might be muted.
[06:30.00]Am I muted?
[06:31.39]Am I muted right now?
[06:33.39]No, you're good.
[06:34.17]I can hear you now.
[06:34.93]Can we all talk?
[06:36.46]Yeah, it's gotta be blue, but we're good now.
[06:38.55]We're all talking.
[06:39.13]Can we talk to each other?
[06:39.94]Some of you are louder than others, though.
[06:41.24]I don't know how to fix that.
[06:43.60]Oh shit.
[06:45.32]Every game needs an individual volume slider.
[06:47.51]Who's too loud?
[06:48.52]I'm smoking.
[06:50.02]Vinny, you are loud for me.
[06:53.01]I lowered myself by 25%.
[06:54.60]Is this better?
[06:55.93]Maybe a little bit more?
[06:57.85]How loud am I?
[06:58.50]I think you're okay.
[07:04.47]Oop, how about this?
[07:05.28]I can lower myself.
[07:06.18]I think that sounds good.
[07:08.03]Alright.
[07:09.40]Alright, you guys ready?
[07:10.64]Who wants to drive?
[07:11.25]Go to the clown motel.
[07:12.35]I'm ready.
[07:17.23]I'll drive.
[07:18.94]So where do we want to go?
[07:20.67]I'm smoking.
[07:21.82]I want to go to El Capitan, the mountain in Star Trek 5, the worst one.
[07:27.14]Your character looks unrealistic in real life standards.
[07:29.73]Alright, well sit down.
[07:30.56]Your character looks just like you.
[07:32.56]Oh, sorry.
[07:33.08]What?
[07:37.63]Let's see if we got an owner's manual here.
[07:39.86]I'm gonna read from the owner's manual.
[07:41.87]Am I in first gear?
[07:45.16]Uh, there's a winch.
[07:47.12]Wait, there's, uh...
[07:49.36]This FOV needs to be a little higher.
[07:51.20]I cannot see anything when you do that, by the way.
[07:53.35]So whatever happens is about to happen, and I don't know if it's going to be bad.
[08:00.36]That was so loud.
[08:06.36]Was it me screaming that was loud?
[08:08.64]Yeah, it was.
[08:10.27]Oh god.
[08:14.27]You scared the fuck out of me in real life.
[08:16.98]I asked earlier if I should lower it.
[08:18.88]But you were okay earlier.
[08:20.61]I don't think there's like a compressor.
[08:23.99]How do we?
[08:24.81]Oh, fuck.
[08:25.37]What's that noise?
[08:26.36]Okay, 1.4.
[08:27.02]I'm at 1.4 now.
[08:27.97]Maybe everybody turn yourself down.
[08:31.58]Do you notice that our RV is, like, completely fucked up?
[08:36.18]Dude, we can't- I can't even select my fucking settings anymore.
[08:41.87]Should we use Discord?
[08:44.44]Or is it better than this game because you get lost and shit?
[08:46.97]Wait, what?
[08:47.39]Jerma, how bad is it?
[08:49.88]Everything's fine.
[08:50.50]It's just when people get really loud, it goes like...
[08:54.72]I heard that, yeah.
[08:55.79]Can you guys scream so I can hear it?
[08:59.53]It's not like you're getting hit.
[09:04.79]Okay.
[09:05.47]That's not a scream at all.
[09:06.68]Is there a different view?
[09:08.29]Because if people are just gonna stand in front of me, I'm just gonna get out of the driver's seat.
[09:13.09]Jerma, this vehicle is totally fucked.
[09:15.90]That one crash took off the roof.
[09:19.44]Yeah, we need to reset.
[09:21.39]Just reset the game.
[09:22.31]We gotta figure this out.
[09:23.76]Everything slid down the mountain.
[09:24.82]We can fix this.
[09:30.25]Oh, I can't drive it.
[09:31.16]It's a car.
[09:31.66]We can push, apparently.
[09:34.94]We can push the RV.
[09:39.50]I don't know, someone told me.
[09:43.24]Spam X?
[09:45.22]Oh god, oh my god.
[09:48.06]Was it really a Devil May Cry moment for Jirba?
[09:51.02]Ah, no.
[09:52.52]Dude, nothing compares to that ever.
[09:56.46]Okay, we should... Let's just reset the server.
[10:05.25]I crashed into a tree.
[10:08.10]Look at your health.
[10:09.39]You guys were throwing us in the air and breaking all of our...
[10:12.68]I have broken bones and the RV is fucked.
[10:15.24]What?
[10:16.17]Let's start it over!
[10:17.29]It's bad.
[10:18.78]It's real bad.
[10:21.55]Drinking...
[10:28.57]Hey!
[10:29.64]And that's why I'm going through what I'm going through.
[10:32.44]Are you guys hearing me the whole time?
[10:33.86]Can you raise your mic more somehow in game?
[10:36.03]Yeah, your report card.
[10:43.27]You are for me.
[10:44.44]This game's freaking me out.
[10:47.53]How am I for audio?
[10:50.75]You're good.
[10:51.27]You sound perfect.
[10:52.62]A, B, C, D. I'm actually maxed out again.
[10:54.76]Okay.
[10:56.67]No, Sturge, you're fucking with me.
[10:57.98]I was loud.
[10:59.84]Alright, so let's actually play the game.
[11:02.57]Can you move the gain up in game?
[11:04.54]Yeah, no.
[11:05.64]Fuck, I was muted again.
[11:06.66]God damn it.
[11:08.69]Okay, everybody get in the fucking car.
[11:12.06]I don't know.
[11:13.22]We may have to switch.
[11:14.53]Oh, burgers.
[11:16.03]At some point.
[11:18.16]What the hell is that?
[11:20.69]Somebody do... That's the laugh on the TikTok videos.
[11:23.34]What is that?
[11:24.25]the fuck is that that's like the look a funny TikTok is playing it's the laughing sound effect
[11:33.34]What was that?
[11:34.71]I'm fucking muted again.
[11:38.40]Okay, somebody re- You're just talking Discord.
[11:40.13]This is not going well.
[11:42.12]Everybody get in the RV.
[11:44.31]Get this shit off.
[11:45.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[11:46.22]Bring the stuff.
[11:46.86]Bring the stuff.
[11:47.47]Bring the burgers.
[11:48.17]Bring the beer.
[11:48.76]I'm not driving this time.
[11:53.20]There was a manual.
[11:54.17]I'll drive, but...
[11:55.95]I'm reading it.
[11:59.14]You need scrap metal to repair.
[12:00.59]I have some scrap metal.
[12:01.55]There was scrap metal at the base.
[12:05.45]You can only hold one item, I think.
[12:09.49]I just threw a cigarette on the ground.
[12:16.95]Wait, that was actually you, Poke.
[12:18.23]I thought that was the sound of the fucking laugh sound effect.
[12:22.06]Yeah, same.
[12:23.61]I looked at the clip.
[12:24.65]The clip made me die.
[12:26.70]Oh, of the loud noise?
[12:28.85]Yeah, it was pretty good.
[12:29.90]I was not going for that at all.
[12:32.33]I just said it.
[12:34.23]It sounds like when you got loud, you broke a window with how loud you were.
[12:41.14]Jerma, is that what inspired you to crash?
[12:44.10]Well, no, what inspired me to crash was the ass that was in my face taking up the entire field of view.
[12:50.85]That sound makes me
[12:59.37]Alright, everybody in.
[13:01.46]Everybody sit.
[13:04.95]Whistir.
[13:05.62]Ster.
[13:06.20]Whistir go.
[13:07.74]I'm coming.
[13:08.74]I'm messing with the audio.
[13:10.45]We're all having a hard time.
[13:11.68]My stomach hurts so bad.
[13:15.70]Can we just please, can we please Discord?
[13:20.56]Yeah, let's use Discord in exactly five minutes.
[13:25.69]No, we have to keep trying, because what if we get lost and shit?
[13:32.68]Don't put your ass in my face.
[13:34.65]Okay, that's how you crash into a tree.
[13:35.94]No, no, no.
[13:36.75]We just did that and we had to reset the server.
[13:39.36]so sit please sit down sit down I have a lot of I have a lot of energy sit down and just use it in the back food
[13:48.29]I probably just fixed my mic, right?
[13:51.35]What was that sound?
[13:52.01]Watch out!
[13:52.29]Watch out!
[13:52.55]Watch out!
[13:52.90]Guys!
[13:53.06]Guys!
[13:53.60]Avalanche!
[13:54.14]Avalanche!
[13:54.52]Rocks falling!
[13:54.87]Rocks!
[13:58.13]That was so scary.
[13:59.71]Everything's failing back here.
[14:00.80]Oh, my God.
[14:02.44]I'm going to Discord.
[14:03.18]I'm opening Discord.
[14:04.13]Park the car.
[14:04.67]Park the car.
[14:05.31]Oh, wow.
[14:05.71]Now everyone wants to go to Discord.
[14:08.12]Hey!
[14:09.47]I'm muting the fucking whole VoIP here.
[14:13.54]Ster, you have to say it with urgency.
[14:14.83]Wow, that was cool.
[14:15.78]Holy shit.
[14:16.91]You have to say it with urgency.
[14:19.49]Why can I still hear him?
[14:20.72]There was no urgency.
[14:21.99]We all went on Discord Poke.
[14:27.42]What?
[14:28.07]For real?
[14:29.27]Yeah, dude.
[14:30.22]It was fucking awful.
[14:32.41]My mic?
[14:33.03]Was it just me?
[14:33.83]It was everything.
[14:35.66]Okay.
[14:38.59]What is going on back here?
[14:40.45]Just mute, mute in-game audio.
[14:42.10]It just bugged me out the car.
[14:48.45]Jerma, you need to... You're still...
[14:49.85]There's two of you.
[14:50.84]Is it... Oh, fuck.
[14:52.42]Okay, there you go.
[14:56.24]We should be good now, right?
[14:58.12]Yeah, where's Poke?
[14:59.81]I got launched out in here.
[15:02.20]Come on.
[15:02.86]No, I'm not.
[15:03.73]I didn't get inside.
[15:04.99]It's hard to get.
[15:06.08]Alright, I'm in.
[15:07.23]Alright.
[15:07.53]Are we good?
[15:08.42]Let's go.
[15:08.90]I guess so.
[15:09.91]I don't know where we're going.
[15:10.76]Can you put the radio on?
[15:11.66]It's too silent.
[15:12.69]I'll turn the radio on here.
[15:17.32]I'm so nervous about my mic.
[15:19.74]No, you're good now.
[15:21.90]Alright, I think we gotta go this way.
[15:25.49]I could fix it in game though.
[15:26.77]I figured out how to fix it.
[15:28.40]Guys, I don't think we're going that way.
[15:30.25]There's a map next to you, Jerma.
[15:32.27]Oh, shit.
[15:32.94]Okay.
[15:35.96]This is, I, like, go ahead and you try fucking reading.
[15:39.15]Good luck.
[15:41.02]It looked like I spilled coffee all over my fucking keyboard.
[15:43.73]Alright.
[15:45.66]Okay, so... Guys, we... Ster, there's two of you.
[15:49.89]Oh, sorry.
[15:50.79]I got used to pressing the button.
[15:53.77]Okay.
[15:54.67]Oh, I get it.
[15:55.53]We gotta line it up with the tires.
[15:58.06]We're going up the hill.
[16:00.15]Is there only two boards?
[16:01.10]No, we're not.
[16:01.95]No, the fuck we're not going up the hill.
[16:04.24]Well, we have to go up the hill.
[16:05.88]There's more boards here.
[16:07.17]Get it close.
[16:08.66]Let me get it.
[16:09.82]Just like you're at a, like you're getting your oil changed.
[16:12.47]Here.
[16:16.23]How do you get in?
[16:19.78]No, you can do it two woods.
[16:21.43]How do you drive it?
[16:27.71]How do I get in the fucking car?
[16:32.66]Nah, that's too much wood.
[16:35.66]I don't know.
[16:36.08]I'm just saying shit.
[16:36.98]No, I think you're right.
[16:40.06]You can store boards on the side of the RV.
[16:42.29]Thank you.
[16:50.93]Okay.
[16:52.60]So I'm gonna drive this.
[16:55.31]And you guys tell me if you can
[16:57.29]You want me to go on webcam and like give you hand motions which way to turn?
[17:00.36]I just gotta line the tires up.
[17:01.97]Only if the filter's on.
[17:05.61]What the hell did I do?
[17:06.82]Yeah, Jerma, this isn't looking great in terms of lining up boards.
[17:10.93]It's so uneven.
[17:13.84]Yeah, I feel like it was fine before, and you just went crazy with it, Vinny.
[17:20.09]Boom.
[17:21.38]Oh, no.
[17:22.42]Okay, I'm gonna pull it up a little bit.
[17:26.37]Come on.
[17:28.03]Come on.
[17:28.68]Wait, come at it on a straight line.
[17:31.59]Not turned.
[17:33.10]Come on it.
[17:34.00]This board is...
[17:37.31]This board is messed up.
[17:38.45]Hang on.
[17:41.14]Come on.
[17:42.68]Okay, R is turn engine off.
[17:44.55]Your turn was totally bugged out on my screen.
[17:47.06]Okay.
[17:48.08]I don't think I'm going to cross that.
[17:49.61]No, you need to go... You're coming at it at an angle.
[17:51.94]Come...
[17:52.84]Go turn a little bit left and then come at it.
[17:56.04]Guys, we don't need to put down four planks when the car has... Oh, shit.
[17:59.59]Oh, my God.
[18:00.18]He's...
[18:00.54]We let him drive.
[18:02.33]We let him drive.
[18:06.08]Yeah, line the car up.
[18:06.97]Is this the game?
[18:08.74]Maybe that's a good idea to have it like that.
[18:10.41]It's hard to turn it...
[18:11.88]It's hard to turn the...
[18:12.50]I don't know what's behind me right now.
[18:13.77]Where are the mirrors?
[18:14.60]Oh, there they are.
[18:20.20]Guys.
[18:21.00]It's hard to come at this with a straight line.
[18:23.47]Touching the wood.
[18:25.67]Put the wood back.
[18:28.34]You can't come at this with a straight line.
[18:30.22]Line up the planks with the tires.
[18:33.01]Yeah, that was... Yeah, the tires drive on it.
[18:36.40]Yeah.
[18:37.87]What the...
[18:38.83]Fuck.
[18:39.57]Oh my god.
[18:41.10]I'm gone.
[18:42.99]What do you mean you're gone?
[18:43.93]I'm gone forever.
[18:45.34]Can someone pick me up?
[18:47.49]I'm in the rocks.
[18:48.82]Hold on, I need to go find this wood that fell.
[18:50.58]I'm lined up.
[18:51.99]You're in the rocks.
[18:55.34]Oh my god.
[18:58.64]That looks lined up.
[18:59.67]That shit's gone.
[19:02.72]Grandma, just drive it forward.
[19:05.29]No, you know, he can't.
[19:06.64]He can't yet.
[19:07.16]I can't.
[19:07.96]And come into the RV for a second because I'm having a fucking problem.
[19:11.18]What?
[19:12.56]I don't... Just somebody come help me.
[19:15.10]Okay, now, Jerma, you can do this.
[19:18.45]Okay, thank you.
[19:21.98]Yeah, I bet you don't.
[19:22.92]Dude, just drive into it.
[19:25.14]I bet you'll be fine.
[19:26.72]Yeah, start slow, and then we'll see where it goes.
[19:30.05]Go very slow.
[19:30.73]He needs to go up.
[19:32.04]He's going to hit the rocks.
[19:32.68]What if he just went fast?
[19:33.94]What if fast is the way?
[19:35.58]You know, a little bit of, not a problem.
[19:38.75]There's got to be more boards, right?
[19:40.38]How are we able to get...
[19:41.24]There's only...
[19:41.74]There's four, and one of them's missing.
[19:43.51]Where was the fourth board?
[19:44.60]Who's driving?
[19:45.22]Just go.
[19:45.70]I promise.
[19:46.26]I think you can make it.
[19:50.83]Dude, wake up.
[19:54.61]Oh, I can't believe we let him drive.
[19:58.39]Alright, great.
[19:59.92]Now don't go forward yet, because we've got to get the board.
[20:02.87]Damn it, he did it.
[20:05.51]He hates to see it.
[20:06.93]He hates to see me succeed.
[20:11.81]How do I put the wood on the car?
[20:13.18]I gotta make the FOV bigger.
[20:14.87]Yeah, how do you attach the shelf?
[20:17.33]Well, I think one at a time, both times.
[20:20.20]Yeah, that's better.
[20:21.63]Yeah.
[20:22.03]Cool.
[20:25.81]Alright, I'm going to scout out what's in front of us.
[20:30.48]He's eating the floor.
[20:33.63]Alright, it is a straight shot.
[20:35.76]It's not hard.
[20:36.47]There's a big turn here coming up.
[20:41.85]Okay.
[20:43.17]Are you gonna drive it now?
[20:44.19]I don't have to.
[20:46.70]I'm not driving a car.
[20:48.03]I already tainted myself too much.
[20:52.12]Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[20:54.42]Who's driving like crazy?
[20:56.61]No, no one.
[20:58.64]A big turn coming up.
[21:01.81]I would start cutting that turn now.
[21:06.64]Excellent.
[21:07.20]Did you import custom tracks in the game?
[21:11.92]Oh, fuck.
[21:14.19]I think you're alright.
[21:16.27]Wait, what is wrong with you?
[21:17.35]Imagine we upload our own songs.
[21:19.28]We all hear it.
[21:19.74]Why?
[21:20.75]What's happening to the RV?
[21:22.37]You connected to a fucking bungee cord.
[21:25.37]I wonder.
[21:26.45]That's gotta be Stirr.
[21:27.54]Stirr fucking did that, guaranteed.
[21:29.08]110% that's Stirr.
[21:31.70]Hey, hey, put me down!
[21:35.19]How do I take it off?
[21:42.64]Sir?
[21:43.16]Just stop.
[21:44.02]I'm kidding.
[21:45.38]No, you're not.
[21:46.10]This is not funny.
[21:46.93]Oh, my God.
[21:48.07]Oh, my God.
[21:48.59]It actually does wrap around the trees.
[21:50.46]It connects to the trees.
[21:51.84]On go, okay?
[21:52.69]Three, two, one, go.
[21:55.13]Ah, you're too fast.
[21:56.28]Three, two, one, go.
[21:59.17]So let's check in with the progress of a bunch of different streamers that have played Are We There Yet?
[22:04.18]Let's take a look at the four horsemen team.
[22:07.98]Looks like they have crossed 0.0003 meters, the lowest of every streamer that's ever played the game.
[22:17.18]Guys, press 1.
[22:18.32]You had to put the mic filter on, remember?
[22:24.52]The highs and lows.
[22:27.20]Alright, get us out of here.
[22:28.88]That's right, Polk.
[22:36.22]Are you good?
[22:37.25]I'm good.
[22:37.89]No.
[22:39.36]I don't know how to back up.
[22:40.87]Put it in reverse.
[22:44.20]True.
[22:45.64]True, though.
[22:47.58]I didn't do anything.
[22:48.57]Wait, what?
[22:51.14]There's no reverse.
[22:52.85]You gotta put it in reverse.
[22:54.01]Hold the clutch button and put it into reverse.
[22:55.78]There's no reverse on the...
[22:57.95]It's the bottom right.
[22:58.71]There's a horn.
[22:59.60]Bottom right.
[23:00.45]Call the clutch.
[23:01.12]Bottom right.
[23:02.69]R.
[23:09.59]Hey, rock, paper, scissors.
[23:12.96]Here we go.
[23:16.02]There it is.
[23:17.12]Easy.
[23:17.68]How do you do rock, paper, scissors?
[23:19.63]How do you do it?
[23:20.37]Hold X.
[23:22.41]Rock, paper, scissors.
[23:23.44]Ready?
[23:23.96]Got it.
[23:25.44]Alright.
[23:25.87]Rock, paper, scissors.
[23:30.05]You're shaking.
[23:30.69]I can't see where you are.
[23:31.57]That was a fist.
[23:34.25]Ow!
[23:36.52]We're pretty damaged now.
[23:38.71]We got engine damage.
[23:39.19]We're missing a door.
[23:39.83]Hold on.
[23:40.13]Let me get the door.
[23:41.78]Did it fall out?
[23:44.76]Where's the door?
[23:46.59]I don't know.
[23:47.22]Oh, you're picking me up.
[23:48.28]That's why.
[23:49.06]I didn't mean to.
[23:50.07]That was weird.
[23:50.65]I just tried to get up.
[23:52.02]Maybe he lost the door.
[23:53.16]This game is really fucking janky.
[23:55.99]Need some work.
[23:56.58]Sure is.
[23:57.82]I want that beer.
[23:58.65]Way to go.
[24:01.83]Shit.
[24:02.31]No, give it to me.
[24:04.77]Wait, who got the door?
[24:05.63]Did anyone grab the door?
[24:06.70]I went looking for the door.
[24:08.58]I guess the car is gone.
[24:11.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:12.46]Star, stop.
[24:17.81]St-
[24:22.00]It's fine.
[24:22.52]He DM'd me.
[24:23.42]He said I need this run anyway, so I'll make it.
[24:26.17]There, I did my part.
[24:27.76]Did the door disappear?
[24:29.73]I think so.
[24:30.11]We don't need it.
[24:30.69]We don't need a door.
[24:31.48]We're fine.
[24:32.24]Alright, let's take a look at what's ahead.
[24:35.45]Uh...
[24:37.34]Is this what you do when you drive, Jerma?
[24:39.21]Do you get out every 15 feet and then walk down the road and come back to your car?
[24:42.81]He's like, I think I can do that.
[24:44.15]That'd be crazy.
[24:48.71]Ow!
[24:50.99]What the hell was that?
[24:55.38]Hang on, I wanna repair the engine.
[25:00.08]I just got kidnapped.
[25:01.62]No!
[25:03.31]Drive!
[25:04.51]Ow, dude, I have fucking broken bones.
[25:08.34]Wait, really?
[25:08.74]Yeah, man.
[25:10.24]See how you like it.
[25:12.43]Engine is underneath the rear bed.
[25:15.69]No.
[25:17.01]Engine takes motor oil.
[25:20.44]I'm going to be careful.
[25:21.39]Get off blade.
[25:23.37]That's some crazy tech.
[25:25.22]Everybody in.
[25:29.19]Everybody in?
[25:30.84]Yeah.
[25:32.31]Do real RVs have engines underneath their beds?
[25:38.24]I've never been inside of an RV.
[25:43.55]Left or right?
[25:44.27]Left looks like a little bit of a pit stop.
[25:45.70]Let's go left.
[25:48.41]Ow!
[25:49.98]Stop hitting me with the hammer.
[25:51.33]This is a checkpoint.
[25:52.13]I'm repairing, repairing, repairing.
[25:58.37]Wait, you get up the hatch.
[26:00.60]start like oh scrap metal here for more repairs how do you put it in park and oil too oil lp
[26:09.93]Alright, Jerma, can you walk 15 feet ahead?
[26:11.36]Is there a way to see how much... Oh, it's in the top.
[26:13.87]Shut up.
[26:15.73]The bathroom's a jump scare.
[26:18.59]What do we do with the oil?
[26:25.27]Oh, nice.
[26:26.62]We went to Caesars, the casino, and Ster was hitting me with a hammer.
[26:32.83]This guy just loves being a fucking menace.
[26:34.94]He's a joker.
[26:37.11]Did you guys win?
[26:38.91]Not really.
[26:40.44]No.
[26:41.32]No.
[26:43.11]A little.
[26:44.26]No, we had a rotten...
[26:46.99]blackjack table, like actually fucking rotten, miserable blackjack table.
[26:51.24]We could have a grill.
[26:54.24]Oh, that sucks.
[26:56.47]Okay.
[26:56.59]I have literally one HP.
[26:59.72]Ster is killing everyone.
[27:02.17]What are you fucking doing?
[27:04.00]I think I'm a dead person.
[27:07.01]What did I do?
[27:10.39]Put it down!
[27:11.97]Put it down!
[27:17.87]Am I alive?
[27:20.08]How do you turn the grill off?
[27:24.33]Was that some lore?
[27:25.30]Did we just miss some lore?
[27:26.61]Probably.
[27:28.57]I don't know if you could hear it over the sound of your own head being beaten with a hammer, but yeah, it was pretty cool.
[27:33.20]Is there a walkie-talkie in the fridge?
[27:34.97]Guys, if you look around, you can find scrap metal.
[27:36.53]I just found scrap metals.
[27:39.55]I did get some scrap metal.
[27:41.42]Hey, here's a question.
[27:42.44]Chat, how do we utilize these oil?
[27:46.19]These oils?
[27:48.00]Yeah.
[27:51.06]No, I don't want to litter.
[27:51.93]Oh, I'm not in the car.
[27:59.01]Whoa, what is this?
[28:00.11]Not the barrels?
[28:08.32]I'm not-
[28:09.35]Wait, Star, before you drive, let me clear the road.
[28:16.01]Alright.
[28:16.52]Good.
[28:20.24]Uh, do it then.
[28:21.90]If you're gonna do it, I wanna see it.
[28:23.43]I'm doing NPC movements, I'm sorry guys.
[28:24.97]Let me see you lift that lumber.
[28:28.78]Alright, we have one scrap.
[28:31.56]Wait, do we really gotta do this?
[28:33.35]There's no way around this?
[28:34.36]Who has the manual?
[28:35.16]Just drive to the right.
[28:36.88]You need a saw, apparently.
[28:38.60]Shit, okay.
[28:39.23]Well, what about over here?
[28:40.23]Can we go left?
[28:41.55]You guys can literally just drive to the right.
[28:44.36]Could you?
[28:44.88]Yeah.
[28:45.35]Yeah, look, boom.
[28:46.91]You could also do this.
[28:49.68]I fixed it.
[28:50.83]That is more fun, though, yeah.
[28:53.03]Go do it.
[28:53.65]It's up to you guys.
[28:54.22]What do you want to do?
[28:54.74]You want to try?
[28:55.68]No, try it, try it.
[28:56.56]Alright, go for it.
[28:56.98]It's good practice.
[29:01.00]Wait, what if it was more in the middle so it becomes like a seesaw in the middle?
[29:05.45]That could be fun.
[29:07.54]I feel like they might be, if there's physics with this, this could be a disaster.
[29:11.44]I say we try it.
[29:15.28]Ster, I'm going to get on top of the RV and I'm going to guide you.
[29:19.26]I'll let you know how you're doing.
[29:20.71]Alright.
[29:21.67]Hold on.
[29:22.17]Hold on.
[29:22.45]Don't go there yet.
[29:25.95]You can use beer cans for scrap metal, apparently.
[29:34.79]We are out of scrap metal now, too, so we'll need some.
[29:37.36]I have four.
[29:38.83]Oh, zero.
[29:39.70]That's a collective amount.
[29:42.76]Oh, wait.
[29:43.18]You actually did it.
[29:44.34]That was sick.
[29:45.91]Nice.
[29:46.53]That was good.
[29:49.46]Okay.
[29:51.48]Monster Monday.
[29:53.59]Um...
[29:59.19]They put the radio on.
[30:03.09]Hey, you did it!
[30:04.23]Congratulations!
[30:06.10]You went the wrong fucking way!
[30:09.81]Drive till you die.
[30:12.36]Backwards.
[30:14.92]I think this is the way we came from that's the way we came from we have to go the way that you just drove from don't isn't it wait but we went over log
[30:27.22]Yeah, I think... Yeah.
[30:33.22]Yeah, we have to go around.
[30:35.02]Yeah.
[30:36.79]That was very impressive, though.
[30:38.66]That was good.
[30:44.12]Dead.
[30:45.84]Oh my god!
[30:46.56]Wait, are you actually dead?
[30:49.54]No, but I did get crushed.
[30:52.30]I like this game.
[30:53.20]It's a really nice vibe.
[30:54.69]I can't believe you're drawing a circle.
[30:56.62]And we're so proud of ourselves that we went over.
[30:58.53]I think you've got to go down the hill.
[31:01.78]Oh, be careful, hun.
[31:03.81]I think the game needs, like, more sounds, though.
[31:05.70]Oh, yeah, and by the way, just read over in my chat...
[31:09.51]That's why you scout 15 feet ahead.
[31:11.74]Bear!
[31:11.86]Bear!
[31:12.22]What the fuck is a bear?
[31:13.65]That's a pig!
[31:14.66]What is that?
[31:16.60]What do I do?
[31:17.09]What do I do?
[31:19.32]Uh, play dead, play dead, play dead.
[31:21.30]Oh, he's coming to you.
[31:22.69]What do you mean?
[31:25.00]Uh, if it's brown, go to town.
[31:26.35]If it's black, uh, fight back.
[31:33.10]It's coming!
[31:35.52]I love black bears.
[31:36.61]They're so cute.
[31:40.53]What?
[31:41.39]Ah!
[31:42.05]Oh, yeah.
[31:42.54]What?
[31:42.70]What is happening?
[31:43.76]Where's the repair hammer?
[31:44.65]Where's the repair?
[31:45.19]Who's got the repair hammer?
[31:46.07]I need help.
[31:46.61]It's up on the... Oh, I don't know.
[31:48.44]Someone lost the repair hammer.
[31:51.21]I'm holding it in my hand.
[31:52.62]There's a bear chasing after me.
[31:54.40]Attack the bear.
[31:54.90]Oh, attack?
[31:56.09]He's going to kill me.
[31:57.57]Get in here.
[31:59.04]We just left him.
[32:01.75]Climb up on the ladder.
[32:02.66]Climb the ladder and get on top of the RV.
[32:06.15]Everything's fine.
[32:07.81]I die, everything's fine.
[32:09.55]Everything is totally fine.
[32:10.55]I am in perfect... Me and the bear are perfectly in sync with one another.
[32:16.22]Are you dead?
[32:17.06]No.
[32:17.92]But I'm going to need you to have to come back and I'm going to have to pull up like an Uber driver and kind of pick me up and tell me when you're here.
[32:24.94]Yeah.
[32:27.44]Okay, we're good.
[32:30.54]Excuse me, where- I'm gonna die.
[32:32.85]I'm gonna die for real.
[32:41.82]I'm dead!
[32:42.72]I'm dead!
[32:43.76]It's an RV!
[32:45.43]How'd you die?
[32:46.75]Oh!
[32:48.62]Chill up here with me.
[32:50.37]Dude, your car is made- it came apart like a LEGO set.
[32:53.55]What the fuck is this thing made out of?
[32:56.24]We're PvPing.
[32:58.24]How'd you even die?
[32:59.52]Were you not in the RV?
[33:01.25]No, I'm alive.
[33:02.66]I'm just... Poke could have killed me.
[33:04.23]He had checkmate.
[33:06.37]We need scrap metal.
[33:08.66]Oh, there's a camp down this way.
[33:12.47]I'm going to look at the camp.
[33:15.15]Did someone kill that bear?
[33:16.49]The bear despawned for some crazy reason.
[33:19.06]I don't know why.
[33:19.83]Someone in my chat said this is literally why I don't road trip anywhere.
[33:23.82]This happens every single time.
[33:27.13]There's water.
[33:28.54]This is fucking snake!
[33:31.21]Where?
[33:33.84]Oh, God, I'm...
[33:34.95]I... Oh, I thought that was a piece of material.
[33:37.28]I got poisoned, but I used the antidote.
[33:41.34]Oh...
[33:47.02]Okay, I took an antidote.
[33:49.31]As well.
[33:51.66]Oh my god.
[33:52.39]Somebody pick up the hammer.
[33:55.32]Oh my god.
[33:57.91]What do we do with these glasses?
[33:59.01]How do we?
[34:02.29]How do I make it scrap metal?
[34:06.97]Are you getting crack?
[34:08.26]Oh, cigarette.
[34:10.41]Yeah.
[34:12.16]Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.
[34:18.61]I jumped right- he was pretending!
[34:20.44]He was- I just got baited, he was literally camping.
[34:24.02]I got him, watch this.
[34:30.63]It's bad down here, fellas.
[34:31.69]Okay, they look like pieces of... Say it.
[34:39.74]Should I bring the RV down there?
[34:41.36]I wanna bring the RV down there
[34:44.47]Are you trying to throw me into a snake?
[34:46.05]What is this all about?
[34:47.46]I just took the antidote.
[34:49.59]I'm sorry.
[34:50.61]Wait, is there still more antidote?
[34:53.17]I thought it was Ster.
[34:56.25]Okay, there's other... Why did I carry this stupid hammer all the way down here?
[35:02.05]What is this?
[35:03.84]How do we break stuff down?
[35:05.45]Should we, we should like actually figure that out.
[35:08.32]The manual in the car.
[35:09.65]Yeah.
[35:15.18]Isn't this lumen that's so bright?
[35:19.79]Where'd you guys go?
[35:22.74]Look at you walking.
[35:26.42]Is there no way to fight back when someone grabs you?
[35:30.75]Grab them right before you get launched.
[35:34.60]You can swim.
[35:35.72]You grab them right as you get launched.
[35:40.44]Can you drink the water?
[35:41.82]I feel safer with the bear and the snakes than Ster.
[35:50.13]Hey, Vinny!
[35:52.13]What are we doing?
[35:53.20]We driving?
[35:53.82]Where are you guys, by the way?
[35:55.72]I'm lost.
[35:57.39]We're in the RV.
[35:59.12]Can you guys honk so I can find it?
[36:00.70]I see air up there.
[36:03.47]I'm kind of all the way down, though.
[36:04.56]How do you... Oh.
[36:05.46]I guess there's not a whole lot of... You can just kind of go back up.
[36:10.20]Is the RV drivable?
[36:12.35]Yeah.
[36:13.33]Alright, I'm gonna fix the window.
[36:18.07]I think I'm lost.
[36:20.58]Fuck.
[36:21.08]I'm trying to fix shit.
[36:22.28]Stop it.
[36:25.95]Oh my god.
[36:32.06]Stop.
[36:32.56]Can you guys honk for me?
[36:33.57]Stop pushing me.
[36:36.24]He started it.
[36:36.94]Oh, you dropped your hammer, you silly little hammer boy.
[36:39.62]I'm trying to help poke.
[36:42.96]You're just honking.
[36:44.43]Yeah, he said, can somebody please honk?
[36:46.38]I've made the most drive progress, so I don't have to do anything for the next hour.
[36:49.77]That's fine.
[36:51.96]I'm fucking lost.
[36:53.68]That's how it works on metal.
[36:57.31]Yeah, we do.
[36:57.90]We actually need metal.
[36:59.55]I found a lot.
[37:01.57]A lot of metal.
[37:02.13]Let me fix the side.
[37:10.55]I wish there was a fucking punch in this game.
[37:14.33]Bear spray.
[37:20.32]Okay.
[37:21.05]The whole side panel is back on the car.
[37:22.72]That's all the scrap that I have, though.
[37:29.00]You just used all the scrap I found.
[37:31.43]That was my scrap.
[37:32.53]Dude, I'm not playing.
[37:34.46]Well, it was very helpful because we repaired the car.
[37:39.17]It's fine.
[37:39.57]Can you guys get me at the houses that we found with the snakes?
[37:44.51]I think we can get down there.
[37:48.28]Oh, beer lets you lift big rocks.
[37:50.83]Maybe it's this way.
[37:51.36]I think I can find it.
[37:54.85]Yeah, it's kind of a poke.
[37:55.97]If you're at the lake, let me see if I can see you.
[38:00.84]Or the water, the body of water.
[38:02.39]You kind of have to just go up the hill.
[38:11.71]Are you driving away from them?
[38:15.34]I'm driving the path He's pretty much at the top of the mountain I'm walking the path
[38:22.02]Oh yeah, I hear you guys.
[38:24.57]Hey.
[38:27.04]Where did our ladder go?
[38:28.53]Oh god, our ladder was destroyed.
[38:30.76]Alright, do not cross this, it's probably unsafe.
[38:33.16]You ever played a Dark Souls game before in your life?
[38:38.07]or any game with any, like, Lord of the Rings characters in it, like, this is not safe.
[38:44.87]I'm not doing it.
[38:45.41]Yeah, one of those woods look breakable.
[38:46.90]You see that wood?
[38:47.75]It's a different color in the middle.
[38:52.63]I think you just gun it across.
[38:54.34]Just go like 50 miles per hour over it.
[38:56.25]I think it'll be fine.
[38:57.73]How are you doing that?
[38:59.10]Hold control and then mouse click.
[39:03.78]Wait, that's exactly what I was saying.
[39:06.05]That's cool.
[39:10.67]That is cool.
[39:11.25]That's good mechanic.
[39:12.52]oh oh over here over here we need a wood over here there's a big gap there is okay should we lay it the other way
[39:22.84]I think we do this horizontal.
[39:24.18]My wood was literally perfect.
[39:26.90]Wait, really?
[39:28.56]Sorry.
[39:31.07]Go ahead.
[39:31.63]Sorry.
[39:33.14]No, you guys handle this one.
[39:35.25]There's thorns over here.
[39:36.24]Be careful.
[39:39.09]Vinny, why did you walk 15 feet ahead of us?
[39:41.76]He hates me.
[39:42.84]I don't know what you just said.
[39:48.97]Where's the Jerma hates Ster?
[39:51.89]Jerma hates you now?
[39:52.93]Oh, I thought I did.
[39:55.00]No, both of you.
[39:59.03]I think it's different because there's a 15-year hatred relationship between the two of us.
[40:06.44]Oh, and for me, it's a new hatred.
[40:09.10]I don't think we even need this wood.
[40:12.06]Yeah, but you don't know.
[40:14.39]I'm afraid this is gonna mess up the car.
[40:19.51]But... My turn to drive!
[40:21.41]I'll be over here, you guys come this way.
[40:23.94]Here, I'll guide with hand signals.
[40:28.49]This is gonna be a disaster.
[40:31.75]Living in a van down by the river.
[40:39.40]You actually might hit that pretty perfectly.
[40:42.72]A little bit more to the right.
[40:43.61]A little bit more to the left.
[40:44.41]A little bit more to the left.
[40:45.07]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[40:46.12]Oh, your wheels.
[40:46.90]Your wheels.
[40:47.93]Stop, stop.
[40:49.11]He's not listening.
[40:51.50]Ow.
[40:52.21]He's not listening, but he did it.
[40:54.15]I just had to wing it, you know?
[40:56.24]Put it down.
[40:58.49]No, this is bad.
[40:59.10]We gotta clear this.
[41:00.40]How do we clear the brush?
[41:01.98]What happened?
[41:03.06]Can we just drive around it?
[41:04.65]Why am I getting hurt?
[41:05.70]There's thorns.
[41:06.48]What the fuck just happened?
[41:07.95]Spiky plants.
[41:08.95]You locked in so hard.
[41:10.30]You didn't even listen to any instructions.
[41:11.99]If I stopped, I would have fell.
[41:17.40]The right wheel was going over the bridge.
[41:28.01]You'd get lost in the middle of the desert if you did an IRL road trip.
[41:30.93]No, I would follow the directions.
[41:33.35]Uh-oh.
[41:33.94]Yeah, it wouldn't be that difficult.
[41:35.20]Guys, yeah, this thing can't drive through this little bush.
[41:38.14]How do we clear the bush?
[41:40.39]Well, first you gotta go reverse, right?
[41:42.30]We need a saw, maybe?
[41:43.55]How much reversing can I do before I fucking die?
[41:47.54]Oh, hey!
[41:48.64]We can push it at the same time.
[41:51.47]Somebody come back here with me?
[41:53.06]We'll time it.
[41:54.32]Oh, that wheel.
[41:56.19]What if you just drove left?
[41:57.82]Oh, there we go.
[41:59.66]I lied.
[42:00.08]It was parked.
[42:04.34]What's ahead of us?
[42:11.35]Alright, we got big, steep, very dangerous hill.
[42:14.65]Keep it in first gear.
[42:15.59]And you're going to have to pretty much hold the brake the whole time.
[42:20.01]Otherwise, you're going off that left edge.
[42:22.78]Okay.
[42:24.55]And I would cut that wheel...
[42:27.01]Very, very, very tight up there, up at the very top of the hill, I would start cutting, but I would not be accelerating.
[42:34.84]You guys ever used to put a water bottle on your bike?
[42:37.07]the tires to make it sound like a motorcycle.
[42:39.59]Yeah.
[42:40.20]We talked about that.
[42:41.48]Where are you going?
[42:42.32]Yeah, we did.
[42:42.78]And I busted my lip doing that.
[42:44.61]Where are you going?
[42:45.27]Yeah, we did talk about that.
[42:47.90]That's not the right way.
[42:49.14]Who's driving?
[42:49.58]I'm winched.
[42:50.45]I'm winched.
[42:52.57]Wait, no, I'm not.
[42:54.28]I did a perfect scout job and gave you perfect scout directions.
[42:57.70]You just turned the wrong way is the problem.
[42:59.18]I was speedrunning.
[43:00.69]So we have to get this out of here.
[43:03.16]Wait.
[43:04.55]We might be able to turn this way.
[43:06.54]If you've already... Is it wedged in between the trees?
[43:11.14]Uh, yeah.
[43:11.90]Yeah.
[43:12.80]Oh, boy.
[43:14.01]Alright, push.
[43:15.59]Oh, this is bad.
[43:17.92]We have to push it out.
[43:22.87]yeah I thought my hands just burned yeah yeah you're having fun right sir
[43:34.14]Cut the wheel to the left.
[43:35.39]How can you not steer?
[43:37.04]I thought that, like, look, if I could make it between these two, I would have skipped the whole turn.
[43:41.32]That's really funny.
[43:42.26]I think we have to... Look, it's like perfect size.
[43:43.99]How did you even get in here?
[43:45.27]How did you even get in here?
[43:49.73]How did you even do this?
[43:51.22]Everybody push on this side.
[43:53.15]On the side I'm on.
[43:57.36]You need the remote.
[43:58.47]You gotta drink a beer to get more powerful.
[44:00.46]No, everyone come push!
[44:01.75]Yeah, we need beer.
[44:03.40]There's beer.
[44:04.64]No one listens.
[44:05.75]Yeah, but we have to be more powerful to... Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[44:08.46]It's inside.
[44:09.17]It spawned in the car.
[44:12.55]No, not the front.
[44:13.46]Vinny, come here on the side.
[44:14.89]Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.
[44:18.74]If we can get this tire around the tree, then it can drive.
[44:22.73]No, you guys, watch this.
[44:25.14]We're getting it.
[44:25.74]We're getting it.
[44:27.43]No, you're not getting it.
[44:28.47]Watch this.
[44:29.14]We're literally getting it.
[44:30.32]Watch this.
[44:31.97]Is someone on the steering wheel?
[44:34.60]Because it's about to roll down this fucking hill.
[44:36.67]Oh, boy.
[44:37.37]No one's on the wheel.
[44:39.20]Switch to rear.
[44:40.22]You pull it.
[44:41.34]How do you... Oh, my God.
[44:44.34]Get the winch off.
[44:47.11]On it, on it, on it, on it, on it.
[44:49.08]It's off.
[44:50.04]No one was listening to the calls.
[44:51.53]It's off, it's off, it's off.
[44:54.92]What have we done?
[44:56.63]What have you done?
[44:58.79]Alright, now pull it.
[45:00.38]Do the, uh, forward wrench.
[45:01.96]What do you... Stop.
[45:03.25]We gotta pull it through.
[45:06.24]How are you going to get there without being pulled?
[45:08.71]How the fuck?
[45:10.42]No, do the forward winch.
[45:11.60]He's right.
[45:11.95]Do the forward winch.
[45:12.91]Trust me.
[45:13.31]It's worth a shot.
[45:15.08]Alright, do it.
[45:16.48]You have to go to the back.
[45:18.40]There's a little thing you can do.
[45:19.89]Oh!
[45:21.28]There's a reload option that takes you to the last checkpoint, apparently, as well.
[45:24.93]Pull that.
[45:25.65]Go forward on that winch.
[45:26.96]I'm pulling it.
[45:27.46]I'm pulling it, right?
[45:28.12]It's pull.
[45:28.70]Come on!
[45:32.48]Almost, almost.
[45:33.29]Oh!
[45:37.37]Maybe we should pull it to this right tree on me right here.
[45:39.54]You see what I'm saying?
[45:40.38]Yeah.
[45:45.73]Over here.
[45:51.84]OK, you got me.
[45:52.76]There you go.
[45:55.30]It's still stuck.
[45:56.06]Pull it.
[45:56.56]Pull it again.
[45:57.02]I'm pulling it.
[45:58.21]It might explode.
[46:01.52]Dude, why did you do that?
[46:02.32]I'm gunning it.
[46:04.54]Oh!
[46:05.33]It's coming!
[46:10.08]It's gonna happen.
[46:12.51]Get behind and push.
[46:18.50]Oh my gosh!
[46:25.96]Oh my god, why did that audio?
[46:30.60]What is happening to the audio?
[46:32.65]The audio came back.
[46:33.35]Oh my god.
[46:33.90]Mute, mute, mute, mute.
[46:35.36]Mute, mute, mute, mute.
[46:36.57]What the fuck, dude?
[46:39.07]Hit me, everybody.
[46:47.54]It'd be...
[46:52.00]Oh, hey, sir, I got a good idea.
[46:53.43]All I need is to fucking drive between two trees.
[46:55.68]Wait, wait, wait.
[46:56.12]We didn't get the scrap metal from the checkpoint.
[46:58.47]We...
[46:59.12]He's not even...
[47:00.08]He's just completely...
[47:01.25]He's glazed over.
[47:02.21]Look at him.
[47:03.19]Dude, Sturt, can you lock in?
[47:05.08]He's too locked in.
[47:06.04]Jesus fucking...
[47:08.80]Your mic is on.
[47:10.19]Ster wants loot.
[47:11.71]That's the thing.
[47:12.14]He wants rares, epics, and legendaries.
[47:14.42]And if there's none, he's not happy.
[47:16.97]No, I heard there's legendary tires at the end with prefixes.
[47:22.49]Dude, there's prefixes.
[47:24.22]You guys would have been happy.
[47:25.52]Like, my play should have worked.
[47:27.03]What the?
[47:27.81]Oh, the roof came off.
[47:30.97]Do we even need a roof?
[47:32.04]I got it.
[47:34.31]Job done.
[47:34.87]You guys are all acting like I've been doing nothing.
[47:37.70]Ster, I need you to lock in and clutch the wind.
[47:39.99]There's a term called doing too much.
[47:42.74]doing too much alright let me scout first don't
[47:54.08]Alright, if I stay on the road, he has such a bloodthirst for me.
[47:56.66]He'll not go off the road, right?
[48:00.54]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:02.05]We're already here?
[48:02.63]We don't need the wood.
[48:04.09]Just drive.
[48:05.46]Yeah, you're good.
[48:08.57]Don't drive into me.
[48:09.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:12.79]he's not gonna stop no we're okay wait this is a speed run guys there's a there's a bear
[48:22.50]Guys?
[48:24.26]Yeah, there's a bear.
[48:25.11]He's about to...
[48:27.94]He's going to attack.
[48:29.63]He's faster than the RV.
[48:31.49]Can I ride him?
[48:38.11]Is that even a bear?
[48:38.87]What the fuck is that thing?
[48:39.71]I know, I thought it was a pig.
[48:40.56]I thought it was a rhino for a minute.
[48:41.40]We're back to where we were.
[48:42.51]Oh no!
[48:43.69]The bear is destroying the RV.
[48:49.62]Wait, I have a spray?
[48:50.53]I don't know what to do about it.
[48:52.59]Where's the spray?
[48:53.67]Wait, you got bear spray?
[48:54.69]We don't have it anymore because we reset, I think.
[48:57.64]Oh, yeah.
[48:58.59]They're lying.
[48:59.31]How do we despawn them?
[49:01.97]Drive into him.
[49:04.20]He's running away.
[49:05.14]He's gone.
[49:06.17]He doesn't like the cigarette smell.
[49:08.66]Yeah, just smoke at him.
[49:09.60]Throw your cigarettes at him.
[49:18.69]Oh, we take a beer.
[49:20.04]Drink a beer and then punch the bear.
[49:23.26]Oh.
[49:23.90]Careful.
[49:25.83]Okay.
[49:26.91]We have a task ahead of us.
[49:28.58]I'll repair the ladder so we can, one of us can get up there and scout.
[49:31.73]Let me see if there's a ladder.
[49:32.75]Who's driving this?
[49:34.07]We should figure out a way to
[49:35.82]I'll take this.
[49:37.45]This is flammable.
[49:39.21]Oh!
[49:39.88]Bear!
[49:42.39]Bear's back.
[49:44.34]Poke, make it fall.
[49:45.73]Get on the ladder.
[49:46.63]My push does nothing.
[49:47.55]He doesn't care about the cigarettes.
[49:48.90]He built the tolerance.
[49:51.14]He's on my ass.
[49:53.47]Everybody get in.
[49:58.43]Will he attack?
[49:59.32]We might just have to go.
[50:03.15]I believe in you.
[50:04.19]Okay, close the door.
[50:05.40]I think you gotta go.
[50:06.20]I do, I have to go.
[50:09.86]Yeah, I'll put music for you too.
[50:12.08]Oh.
[50:12.16]Let go of me.
[50:16.60]What the fuck?
[50:18.18]Oh.
[50:18.92]We don't need a roof, we don't need a...
[50:22.23]Perfect, perfect.
[50:23.57]Perfect, perfect.
[50:24.58]A little left, a little left, a little left.
[50:26.00]Get out of the way!
[50:26.42]Get out of the way, you fucking idiot!
[50:30.04]Alright.
[50:32.27]I actually was stressed out there.
[50:35.98]I don't want that to be on me.
[50:37.31]I don't want that to be on me.
[50:39.29]That can't be on me.
[50:41.97]What's in front of me?
[50:43.84]What's in front of me?
[50:44.68]What's in front of me?
[50:46.49]I have to park the car.
[50:47.37]What's in front of me?
[50:47.96]You're going to make a right.
[50:48.96]Cut a right.
[50:49.56]No, I can't do it after that stress.
[50:51.79]Alright, I'll do it, I'll do it.
[50:52.77]Alright, Vinny, you do it.
[50:59.33]That was like a horrible place to see an ass.
[51:04.35]Hard right.
[51:05.43]Hard right.
[51:07.18]You might have to back up.
[51:08.31]You might have to back up.
[51:08.99]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[51:16.65]No, no, no, no.
[51:17.59]Okay, okay.
[51:18.19]It looked like you were going over to the right side.
[51:21.31]I wish it was like a third person mode.
[51:22.48]I can look at the car.
[51:28.00]Anunnaki?
[51:29.57]The fuck is this guy talking about?
[51:33.82]Oh boy, that does not look good.
[51:38.40]I'm surprised there is no third person.
[51:46.79]I think you guys are the third person.
[51:53.71]I guess it would be cheating.
[51:55.14]Alright, we need a checkpoint.
[51:57.00]Look at all this stuff.
[51:57.91]Look at all this stuff.
[51:58.51]Oh, right there, right there.
[51:59.51]We deserve a checkpoint after that.
[52:01.04]Hey, Jerma, throw me at it.
[52:04.11]Behind you.
[52:05.74]Throw me at the car.
[52:10.74]Ah, do it again.
[52:11.30]Do it again.
[52:11.74]Do it again.
[52:12.29]What?
[52:12.73]What's wrong with you?
[52:14.88]Ramp.
[52:16.15]One more time.
[52:17.60]Keep going.
[52:18.32]Tell me when you're going to throw.
[52:19.79]I'm going to throw in 1, 2, 3, now.
[52:25.73]That's the tech.
[52:26.98]That is pretty cool to the other side of the map.
[52:29.95]Oh, I see what you're saying is just leave the car and just
[52:36.99]You need a roof.
[52:39.22]The jump tech.
[52:40.07]We need a roof.
[52:41.70]Is it over here?
[52:42.96]It's a good thing people left all these things for us here.
[52:47.30]Yeah.
[52:49.03]What do we do with the winch poles?
[52:50.92]Can we just
[52:52.70]I don't know.
[52:53.36]I'm sure we'll find out.
[52:55.07]We're going to need them at some point.
[52:56.42]Actually, put the stuff on the shelf.
[52:59.29]It feels like everything's kind of flying around here.
[53:03.01]We're going to find out, I bet.
[53:05.50]Is there a trunk, technically?
[53:13.73]Fix the damn RV.
[53:15.17]Oh, on the roof.
[53:15.76]I mean, we're trying.
[53:17.72]What do we need?
[53:18.25]I can do it.
[53:19.51]What's the most pressing thing?
[53:21.50]Can you throw me on the roof?
[53:22.75]We need to fix the roof?
[53:24.26]Throw me up there.
[53:26.26]Okay.
[53:27.67]Thank you.
[53:30.48]I'm dying.
[53:31.78]Oh, attach the... Use motor oil.
[53:34.68]You're supposed to attach the winches to the...
[53:37.42]To the roof.
[53:38.56]Alright, toss them up here to me.
[53:42.22]Oh, we have a Flipatronic 2000 up here.
[53:44.81]Dude, we need a windshield.
[53:47.05]Fix the ladder too?
[53:49.58]Yeah, what's the most pressing thing to fix right now?
[53:54.76]Throw me more stuff.
[53:55.48]Is there more shit?
[53:57.60]I think the vibes are perfect right now.
[54:00.39]What are you talking about?
[54:01.63]They're not fucked.
[54:02.72]Yeah, vibes.
[54:03.24]I feel great.
[54:05.42]I'm hella anxious.
[54:06.71]What's going on?
[54:09.23]The ladder?
[54:09.73]Where's the ladder?
[54:11.80]Ladder needs a platform and then you've got to repair a ladder into existence.
[54:16.56]Where's it usually...
[54:18.70]What side?
[54:19.12]Like the back?
[54:19.72]It should be somewhere around the back.
[54:22.85]Yeah, I forgot.
[54:24.41]Left rear.
[54:25.31]Left rear.
[54:26.78]So like back here?
[54:29.38]I guess.
[54:30.98]Oh, Jerm, Jerm, you need this.
[54:34.14]You need the platform.
[54:35.76]The bumper.
[54:36.43]You need the bumper.
[54:37.39]Oh!
[54:38.72]Someone killed Poke!
[54:40.02]Am I dead?
[54:40.55]Wait, why is he dead?
[54:43.84]Oh, thank you.
[54:44.74]Wait, you actually die?
[54:46.37]Yeah, throw me up there.
[54:49.36]Yeah, I didn't want to use our only scrap on something that was bad.
[54:53.54]You need the wheel with you, right?
[54:55.09]No, just throw me.
[54:58.00]We're not getting the ladder, are we?
[55:02.84]We definitely should take this other tire.
[55:04.26]Was the ladder here?
[55:04.68]Chat, was it here?
[55:06.86]You healed me.
[55:08.02]Ladder's back.
[55:09.39]I get it.
[55:10.47]Oh, hell yeah.
[55:11.11]We have three left.
[55:12.78]Alright, I'm gonna throw the repair hammer down.
[55:15.26]Um, I need more winch poles.
[55:17.21]Throw those up here and we'll, we'll attach them.
[55:18.98]Winch poles.
[55:19.38]You got it.
[55:23.20]Uh, yeah.
[55:27.70]Huh?
[55:32.64]I just keep thinking about Ster and how much fun he was having in that fucking Roblox rat game.
[55:42.06]You know, sometimes we get our game and we only get it for 20 minutes.
[55:44.95]Oh, there's a shit ton of scrap right over this hill.
[55:47.56]Be right back.
[55:51.05]One second.
[55:56.06]Dude, when I looked over at my chat, it was just L spam.
[56:02.09]For what?
[56:03.51]For that rat game.
[56:08.82]I thought it was funny.
[56:09.69]I had no idea what was going on.
[56:11.97]I thought it was funny.
[56:16.30]Uh, okay.
[56:17.67]Let's attach this to...
[56:19.00]Okay, we have a lot of good... Can't put that up there?
[56:24.68]I can't put the oil in here?
[56:25.84]Why?
[56:26.75]Why not?
[56:35.64]Can I put this anywhere?
[56:36.60]Uh... Well, whatever.
[56:44.98]It has to be in a wide one.
[56:46.35]This one isn't wide down here.
[56:47.86]Oh, okay.
[56:48.12]Over the side.
[56:48.88]Alright.
[56:51.17]Do we need oil in the car?
[56:53.44]Hey, Jerma, catch this.
[56:58.16]Ooh.
[57:00.49]I'll take some.
[57:03.04]Sardines?
[57:03.46]Hey, Jerma.
[57:04.57]Jerma, catch this.
[57:10.26]Boom.
[57:15.40]Well, apparently there's tech with this thing.
[57:18.01]Oh, there's tech.
[57:20.25]Does it show where we are?
[57:24.71]Oh.
[57:26.62]Okay.
[57:27.97]Oh, it does show where we are.
[57:29.54]Look at how much progress we've made.
[57:33.55]Yeah, but now we're at Turn Mountain.
[57:36.18]We actually are kind of in a shitty place, though.
[57:38.90]Ready to go.
[57:40.86]Because we need to go through the mud pit and then this way, I think.
[57:46.51]I don't know.
[57:47.60]What do you think?
[57:50.18]Higher?
[57:52.92]Hmm.
[57:56.20]How's it look?
[57:56.96]You see where we are?
[57:59.40]No, you're shaking too much and it's so small.
[58:04.43]Guys.
[58:06.12]Okay, how are we doing?
[58:09.06]engine's like it seems like if we go over this hill right here it's a shortcut
[58:16.40]Isn't our RV kind of screwed up?
[58:20.62]Wait, where do we even need to go?
[58:21.60]I'm telling you right now.
[58:25.14]I can only do one thing at a time.
[58:27.31]My brain was looking at the map.
[58:28.75]If we go over this, it's a shortcut right next to the RV.
[58:32.02]Alright.
[58:34.11]As far as I can tell.
[58:35.60]This guy just can't get enough of Ster's green bean.
[58:38.17]No, Ster's broccoli.
[58:41.63]He boiled it.
[58:43.45]He just boiled it.
[58:44.43]That's all he did.
[58:45.28]And it was delicious.
[58:46.80]The natural broccoli flavor was there.
[58:49.50]You don't know what I did.
[58:50.95]What did you do?
[58:52.59]I just put it in foil.
[58:55.80]Should we have the...
[58:56.89]These are spread out a little too far.
[59:00.66]Ster, do you remember the...
[59:03.97]The guy at the horror land.
[59:07.52]Who?
[59:08.20]broke the golden rule.
[59:11.20]He wasn't supposed to speak.
[59:12.30]Is there a plan for when we get over this?
[59:15.80]Uh, no, which one are you saying?
[59:19.07]When I said you're being a buzzkill, and then he was like...
[59:23.15]you are or something remember that you said that you're the worst person to bring to a
[59:28.39]a Halloween horror something.
[59:31.38]And then the guy who worked there said, I know, right?
[59:34.96]Yeah.
[59:36.69]He said exactly.
[59:39.69]He turned to the two of us and he said, exactly.
[59:45.77]it was it was a really great time I I genuinely loved hanging with you guys poke I'm going to be honest we were going to tease you a little bit but the truth is we just missed you wait wait wait wait wait wait
[59:56.89]Sorry, guys, I just, uh...
[59:58.90]Yeah, but we were thinking... We'll get you eventually.
[60:02.67]We thought it might have been kind of funny if we took a group photo, but we've had your stream up.
[60:07.57]and you were in the fourth spot, but it was your stream on a TV.
[60:11.52]Yeah.
[60:13.59]Hold on.
[60:13.83]We need to line him up with his tires.
[60:16.58]Thanks for thinking about me.
[60:18.12]We were, we were, but we'll get you one day.
[60:20.19]We'll do something together.
[60:22.98]We had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner.
[60:25.35]You should have that.
[60:28.34]She gave me a lot of shit for not going.
[60:30.97]This is exactly what I was concerned about.
[60:34.53]We need to winch it.
[60:37.14]We got the winch hooks.
[60:44.26]I need a winch hook over here.
[60:45.78]Oh, I can put it on a tree.
[60:47.38]Put it on the tree, yeah.
[60:48.37]Yeah, yeah.
[60:48.81]Wait, I don't want to get it stuck on anything.
[60:50.05]Right here?
[60:50.65]Yeah, yeah.
[60:51.10]This is going to be a disaster.
[60:53.59]Ah, dude, no, this is gonna be sick.
[60:55.82]Why am I holding this tire?
[60:57.40]Are you wasting gas?
[60:58.61]Whoa.
[61:03.27]You have the winch controller?
[61:05.26]I don't, but we should take...
[61:06.96]Hold on.
[61:07.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[61:08.13]Before you do anything, we should put some of these... We gotta put the boards where we want to pull it.
[61:13.26]Do you know what I'm saying?
[61:14.17]Like, if we're going to pull it this way, we should have... Because where are we even trying to go with this?
[61:18.73]Like, what direction?
[61:19.41]What is the... How is this a shortcut?
[61:21.74]I think just pulling it might be the play here.
[61:23.45]Okay, okay.
[61:24.42]I was going to tell you, but everyone's going to just keep fucking judging everything I do.
[61:28.15]Well, I just, where do you want us to put planks?
[61:30.60]You know, I'm glad Poke didn't go another person to gang up on me.
[61:36.15]I just want an explanation as to where you want... You said it was a shortcut.
[61:40.56]What happened?
[61:42.18]We're turning to the right.
[61:44.17]We don't need to go up that hill.
[61:45.19]We're turning right.
[61:46.68]Connection to host lost?
[61:49.14]What?
[61:49.71]Oh, crap.
[61:53.30]I'm gonna let it go.
[61:56.26]You kicked him?
[61:56.87]He kicked him, I think.
[61:58.90]Guys, we have a limited amount of revives if you're jumping off.
[62:03.50]You may be able to just drive over this, but hold on.
[62:07.55]I need an invite, sir.
[62:09.12]I'm sorry.
[62:09.60]No.
[62:11.15]Yes.
[62:11.49]I'm fucking dead.
[62:13.09]No.
[62:15.41]Can you just drive up this?
[62:16.61]I'm afraid you can't, but...
[62:18.34]Hold on.
[62:31.28]Alright, now we gotta spread them out.
[62:35.25]Does that work, Vinny?
[62:36.70]Yeah, I'm here.
[62:38.09]We can hear your voice.
[62:43.21]Wait, no you can't.
[62:44.32]In game?
[62:45.46]Yeah.
[62:46.16]Oh, God.
[62:47.55]And you know?
[62:48.67]Yes.
[62:49.32]There you go.
[62:50.12]You know.
[62:51.10]We need to move some of these planks.
[62:52.71]Because this is going to...
[62:54.87]This is going to be messed up here.
[62:56.14]The winch strats didn't work.
[62:59.07]I'm afraid of... No, they did.
[63:00.79]What if you can you go?
[63:02.70]Hold on a sec.
[63:03.85]Do you think you can get up that?
[63:06.22]I think that's too far.
[63:07.01]We need to be spread out a little more.
[63:10.09]What's up there?
[63:10.75]Am I just going to fall?
[63:11.87]There actually is.
[63:13.80]It actually, if it doesn't crash straight down and explode.
[63:21.61]uh this rock hey wait no this rock on the other side would be easier it's already slanted
[63:27.27]So I should turn back left?
[63:28.35]That's gonna be hard for him to turn around.
[63:29.84]I can do it.
[63:31.00]Um, I mean... Poke's really fucking good at this, dude.
[63:37.29]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[63:38.26]Just be careful because you got your backs up against the wall.
[63:45.21]You got plenty of room back here if you want to back up a little.
[63:48.32]You good?
[63:50.20]Excellent.
[63:51.20]Dup, dup, dup, dup, dup, dup.
[63:54.88]No, not that way.
[63:55.94]Not that way.
[63:57.65]Well, you said up this hill.
[63:58.85]Actually, you're in a perfect spot to cut the wheel.
[64:01.67]You cut the wheel so you go right.
[64:03.21]Yep.
[64:04.08]What you just did.
[64:05.76]And do it hard.
[64:07.17]Why don't you change your name to player with
[64:09.54]I don't think you understood what I was asking.
[64:12.98]I heard, go ahead, do it hard.
[64:18.57]You know what's so funny?
[64:25.61]That's it.
[64:25.89]That's it.
[64:26.33]Oh, when you actually got over it.
[64:28.46]And we doubted Poke for a second.
[64:32.35]What was wrong with us?
[64:36.84]Oh yeah.
[64:39.04]A winch fell off.
[64:39.64]When I see this guy... coming... Gotta store these.
[64:47.93]We can't take any more than two?
[64:50.88]Stupid.
[64:53.53]Alright, someone else is trying to drive.
[64:54.73]I've done enough damage.
[64:55.86]Can you put this on top?
[64:58.98]I mean, I'll take the everything bounced off the Academy Award for landing that perfectly if you stopped the clip right there.
[65:13.65]Alright, Mr. Whoa.
[65:17.54]Hold on.
[65:17.96]What's ahead?
[65:19.53]Well, he hasn't drove yet.
[65:21.82]I've driven a little bit.
[65:22.96]I got us through a couple obstacles, but I got this.
[65:25.15]Whoa!
[65:25.72]Whoa!
[65:26.68]Whoa!
[65:27.43]Careful!
[65:28.07]Whoa!
[65:28.53]Actually, be careful because this is a massive steep drop.
[65:31.08]This is a monster drop.
[65:32.67]Wait, be careful.
[65:33.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[65:37.42]Hold on.
[65:38.41]Slower, slower.
[65:39.13]Shut the fuck up.
[65:40.02]You're good.
[65:41.10]Stop.
[65:41.89]Stop.
[65:44.32]Stop.
[65:46.22]Jerma, can you tell him to stop again?
[65:50.55]One more time.
[65:51.27]What about down here?
[65:52.11]It looks like there's scrap metal.
[65:53.92]Follow my hands.
[65:55.86]Vinny.
[65:56.66]OK. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[66:03.23]All his hands, you're running him over.
[66:06.48]Oh, sorry.
[66:08.51]There's so many dodge rolls.
[66:10.14]My iframes got that.

[66:29.74]You know, man,
[66:31.10]You bought me stuff from Area 51 or some shit.
[66:35.06]That's gotta be worth like one point.
[66:36.74]That was very nice, can I just say?
[66:39.29]You know, you were really awesome.
[66:40.98]I really enjoyed hanging out with you in person.
[66:44.45]Gaming!
[66:45.68]Ready?
[66:46.18]I'm launching you.
[66:46.68]Three, two, one, gaming.
[66:51.39]It was actually very, it was very sweet.
[66:54.88]Three, two, one.
[66:56.89]I'm gonna fix some of the car here.
[66:59.47]Three, two, one.
[67:01.96]Guys, this looks... Wow, that was actually kind of cool.
[67:08.02]What's going on?
[67:08.43]Are we lagging?
[67:09.68]Who's lagging?
[67:10.28]Who's ult tabbed?
[67:10.90]There is some lag.
[67:11.63]I mean, it got me kicked before, so there's something.
[67:14.16]Guys, I think this is a winch job.
[67:17.51]Wait, do we have to drive up this?
[67:19.52]I don't know.
[67:20.00]I'm looking up here.
[67:20.43]I think we're going to have to winch up that.
[67:25.51]At this point, why not hike?
[67:27.36]Oh, there are wind poles up here.
[67:30.11]Are you saying we should pull the whole thing?
[67:32.78]There's a garage up here.
[67:34.17]What do you need to poke?
[67:35.82]I'm bugged out.
[67:37.43]Winch poles are single-use disposable.
[67:40.09]I'll come pick you up.
[67:40.72]There's a winch pole down in that little ravine.
[67:44.27]Do we want another one?
[67:47.50]Yeah, can you throw me or pick me up or something?
[67:52.66]Better?
[67:53.23]Yeah, it fixed me.
[67:54.45]Nice.
[67:58.26]Spinny and Ster ignite the passions of the Christ.
[68:02.52]Do we need a winch pole?
[68:05.01]Because there is one down there.
[68:06.72]I got there's two on the top up here yeah how many do we need to do this because I have I have one up here now right here
[68:14.95]I didn't watch Passion of the Christ.
[68:16.56]My dad did.
[68:18.55]Oh, my bones.
[68:20.62]We're kind of burning fuel here, I think.
[68:23.39]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[68:27.39]You guys see where I am up here?
[68:31.03]Oh, I found a winch.
[68:32.00]Yep.
[68:33.04]This is the hill you want to drive up.
[68:35.19]There's already a winch in the ground here.
[68:36.62]Excuse me, though.
[68:37.85]I'd waste it.
[68:40.50]It's gonna be the easier way.
[68:43.03]So you're saying- Oh my god, what is going on with the car?
[68:46.67]What is going on with the car?
[68:48.94]What happened?
[68:49.66]Why did a wild animal just get into the car and drive it off the fucking cliff?
[68:55.59]Yeah, dude, it was weird.
[68:57.31]That was weird.
[68:58.46]You don't know what happened to the car There's been a disaster
[69:07.92]That was a little weird, I'd say.
[69:09.78]Was there a checkpoint any time recently?
[69:11.49]It's up this hill, there's a checkpoint.
[69:14.61]I have to use the bathroom.
[69:16.58]Uh oh.
[69:17.23]I'm gonna sit in the car.
[69:19.53]No, no, this is recoverable.
[69:21.12]We might be able to pull it up.
[69:22.20]Hold on.
[69:23.23]Do you know what happened?
[69:24.35]I was in reverse, and I was happily reversing a little bit,
[69:29.37]And then I...
[69:31.13]Here, winch pole, winch pole, right there.
[69:34.54]Alright.
[69:35.39]So that's what happens when Vinny gets in the car.
[69:37.60]I pressed the wrong button.
[69:38.96]I just pressed the wrong button.
[69:40.09]I'm sorry.
[69:41.96]I'll be right back.
[69:42.78]Two minutes.
[69:44.37]Oh, yeah.
[69:44.63]This is a good... Yeah, me too, Poke.
[69:46.00]This is a good time.
[69:47.26]For the thing we were going to do?
[69:49.25]Vinny, we're going to make sure we get this while they go to pee.
[69:52.02]We could do it.
[69:52.50]We could do it.
[69:52.92]We could do it.
[69:54.79]I can't get in, unfortunately.
[69:56.76]Oh my god.
[69:58.41]It's so damaged.
[70:00.76]It's so sad because I just repaired the whole car.
[70:05.23]Isn't there a flipper on the roof?
[70:08.08]Keep going.
[70:09.79]Keep going.
[70:11.69]You're going to hit a rock.
[70:12.68]Hold on.
[70:13.46]Hold on.
[70:13.78]This is not great.
[70:16.15]I hope you don't hit this rock.
[70:20.68]I can't really...
[70:25.14]Wait, if we push it, push it.
[70:28.22]The rock will work because it's going to get it back on track.
[70:31.33]It'll get it right side up.
[70:32.62]Come on.
[70:34.73]Alright.
[70:35.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[70:36.66]Yeah.

[71:11.82]There's a big repair garage at the top of the hill.
[71:15.33]So where are we going from here?
[71:17.28]So you want to drag this all the way up?
[71:20.31]Yeah.
[71:21.17]I know I kind of revoked my rights to drive here, but give me a minute.
[71:26.61]I have an idea.
[71:27.56]Ster, I know your game of the year is white knuckle, but I don't know if we do the white knuckle strategy here.
[71:32.91]This is going to be insane.
[71:34.18]This is going to be horrible.
[71:34.92]What are you suggesting then?
[71:36.89]I don't have an alternative.
[71:38.82]I don't know.
[71:39.74]Okay, we're doing this.
[71:40.74]Why?
[71:41.37]Do you want to, like, fucking zigzag it up these blocks?
[71:44.52]Hold on, we need to attach it first.
[71:55.24]Give me up on the highest winch.
[71:56.73]Yeah, give me the high one.
[71:59.59]Oh, it's just a little short.
[72:03.47]Jerma, there's a winch down on the ground.
[72:05.23]If you can place like a middling one.
[72:07.01]Yep.
[72:09.90]where we can pull no let's just pull with this first winch no that seems wait he got it wait this guy's the man go go go go go go go go go yeah

[72:20.98]Alright, it's on, it's on, it's on.
[72:22.12]Alright, I need someone to do the winch thing.
[72:23.95]I don't know how that works.
[72:25.83]Where is it?
[72:27.52]It's in the back, right?
[72:32.74]Yeah, it's on the...
[72:33.76]There it is.

[73:01.60]I'm just gonna gun it.
[73:05.46]If we need it, we have one more winch up here.
[73:10.47]I think we're gonna need another one or no we could attach it to a tree oh look at all three of you in there we're working together
[73:21.84]Alright, we're getting kind of up here now.

[73:34.15]Yeah, but you keep reeling me in!
[73:36.96]Do you understand?
[73:37.95]I can't get up there.
[73:39.76]I can't get up there.
[73:40.84]Attach it to the witch.
[73:43.55]Stop!
[73:43.67]You are pulling me with it!
[73:45.06]I'm not touching any buttons.

[73:55.90]You're attached.

[74:42.81]Let it roll.
[74:44.74]Yeah.
[74:45.56]Okay.

[75:36.18]I need to let this go.
[75:38.40]I'm just putting it down.
[75:39.64]I'm just putting it on the ground.
[75:40.63]Ugh.
[75:45.18]I don't think you're supposed to drive it in.
[75:49.67]Dude, I don't think this looks, this looks, this looks odd.
[75:52.46]Okay.
[75:53.16]This is not supposed to be in here.
[75:54.65]You use drill on wheels.
[75:56.70]Maybe we have to drive it in a little bit more.
[75:59.39]Oh, my stomach hurts.
[76:10.83]Jerma, come here.
[76:11.99]Yes.
[76:13.20]Are you serious with this?
[76:14.24]What do you want?
[76:15.67]Are you serious with that?
[76:16.69]Can you please put the winch controller back where you found it?
[76:19.37]I had to put it down, dude.
[76:20.47]It was like a wild animal in my hands.
[76:22.58]Hey, can you put things back when you're done using them?
[76:26.38]Is Poke here?
[76:28.02]He's been AFK this whole time, through this entire saga.
[76:31.57]He missed a lot.
[76:33.34]Yeah.

[76:59.98]I got a power pole.
[77:00.79]The frame is still, like, gone.

[77:08.02]Hoke is live playing our creators.
[77:10.27]Is he?
[77:10.91]Guys, I'm so sorry.
[77:11.98]The Thanksgiving dinner earlier fucked me up.

[77:25.57]We need to repair it.
[77:26.82]Underneath?

[77:48.12]Something like that.
[77:54.10]Okay, I'm fixing the engine.
[77:57.24]Who let the dogs out?
[77:59.65]Alright, the engine is completely fixed.
[78:01.56]We are perfect.
[78:03.84]Engine is good.
[78:04.64]Alright, but now we need scrap to get more frame back.
[78:08.66]There's beer.

[78:35.25]Heck.
[78:36.19]Has anyone said that yet?
[78:37.79]You get it?
[78:39.06]Look for the poop rock.
[78:40.34]No.
[78:40.62]Somebody said.
[78:41.05]Can you explain that?
[78:42.29]Oh, yeah.
[78:42.59]Poop rock is nearby.
[78:43.61]You found one?
[78:45.56]Yeah.
[78:46.36]That was the best part of the previous game.
[78:48.29]Oh, and we have a campsite down here with burgers.
[78:51.05]What?
[78:51.25]You guys want to make burgers?

[79:05.11]What?
[79:05.55]In the video.
[79:07.54]I passed you an alien because you were jealous of my aliens, so I gave you one.
[79:12.24]Oh, there was so much going on.
[79:14.06]Yeah, you'd have to watch it like three more times to get all of the details.
[79:17.41]It really is a Peter Jackson.
[79:19.38]Jerma was right.
[79:20.12]I told you.
[79:24.50]What is baloney?
[79:30.02]Wait, should we make some burgers?
[79:31.53]Let's have a little cookout down here.
[79:35.03]Yeah, everybody come down here.
[79:36.52]I wanted to cook with the rice and I wanted to put it with wheat buns.
[79:41.21]Oh, this is where they do that.
[79:43.44]Okay.
[79:43.52]I'm a rat now.

[81:39.13]It's okay.
[81:41.68]I'll throw you up, okay?
[81:42.71]Yep.
[81:43.43]Everyone hold Q.
[81:44.39]Everybody Q it up.
[81:45.62]Okay.
[81:45.74]I'm going to go first.
[81:48.95]Jerma.
[81:50.06]Ster.
[81:51.06]Vinny.
[81:52.29]Okay?
[81:53.27]Let's do it.
[81:53.69]Three, two, one.
[81:56.28]Boom, boom.
[82:00.33]Oh, shit.
[82:01.96]Oh, you're up there.
[82:02.60]You got up there.
[82:03.28]You got up kind of up here.
[82:04.47]No one caught me.
[82:05.96]Oh, he's gone.
[82:07.75]Ah, whatever.
[82:10.26]I probably could've too.
[82:11.18]He's in the floor!
[82:11.90]Where is he?
[82:13.05]I'm dead and I rolled down the hill to the lake.
[82:16.31]Did you actually?
[82:18.53]Oh my god.
[82:19.86]I'm playing peak now, I guess.
[82:21.20]Dude, Vinny, you actually got up there.
[82:22.57]That's pretty sick.
[82:23.19]I'm kind of trying to... Yeah, I'm trying to platform up to the top, but I can't.
[82:27.73]I think you threw too early.
[82:31.25]Me?
[82:32.99]Yeah, because you weren't done getting your max height yet.
[82:36.15]I was able to hold Vinny for a while before I tossed him.
[82:39.02]Oh, I didn't know we could go that high.
[82:42.00]Two minutes.
[82:42.48]Are you ready?
[82:42.86]Grab me.
[82:43.18]Oh, well, Vinny came down.
[82:44.91]Start getting me ready.
[82:46.62]Do you want to try it again?
[82:47.32]Well, let's do our same order.
[82:50.19]Okay, same thing.
[82:51.25]Vinny's here, let's do it.
[82:52.74]Alright, same order.
[82:55.15]Pope grabs Jermo.
[82:56.18]So I'm going to wait a pretty long time.
[82:57.45]Yeah, that was a pretty long time.
[82:59.50]Did I go a different angle?
[83:04.37]What was it?
[83:04.67]A solid, like, two or three seconds before you were at max peak?
[83:08.46]I mean, you'll feel your character slow down.
[83:11.98]Have you ever played a... You've jumped in a video game before?
[83:16.16]This is pretty fucked up weird shit that we're doing right now.
[83:18.85]This is not hitting the jump button.
[83:22.20]Okay.
[83:24.49]Is that an angle?
[83:27.49]You think he's going to hit the bad angle?
[83:30.20]I think it's a bad angle personally, but you know, whatever.
[83:33.16]And are you guys going camera full tilt up?
[83:36.54]Or are we angling?
[83:37.35]Yeah, I'm doing full tilt.
[83:38.63]Full tilt, yep.
[83:40.31]Okay, let's try it again.
[83:40.90]Ready when you guys are.
[83:42.14]Three.
[83:43.03]Two, one, go.
[83:52.12]It's about the same height as before.
[83:54.27]Poke catch me.
[84:02.15]I throw you and you pick me up.
[84:03.86]Ready?
[84:04.38]Guys, it's a little too high.
[84:06.11]We can do this two men.
[84:06.91]We can do this two men.
[84:08.02]Sure, we can.
[84:09.67]Ready?
[84:10.19]I'll throw a U-Poke.
[84:11.25]You guys should get the initial height.
[84:14.32]Alright.
[84:14.65]You guys ready?
[84:15.97]Yep.
[84:17.23]It may be better to throw all at the same time to accumulate speed.
[84:23.58]The momentum was fucked.
[84:24.78]I never even got the prompt to grab you.
[84:26.95]Oh, Vinny, you mean like just all of us let go at the same time?
[84:30.21]That actually might be kind of good.
[84:31.30]About that, like on the upswing.
[84:34.93]Okay, guys.
[84:36.30]We have two revives left.
[84:38.04]What?
[84:38.33]That costs shit?
[84:40.47]Yeah.
[84:40.77]Yeah.
[84:42.08]Oh.
[84:44.74]There's also graves.
[84:46.99]We can use those.
[84:48.52]What the fuck?
[84:51.02]Use the bounce pad?
[84:52.69]No, that was a reversible pad.
[84:53.92]That wasn't a bounce pad.
[84:56.01]That was like, if you flip your vehicle, you can use that, I think.
[84:58.76]Well, we got a lot of scrap.
[84:59.50]Use the graves.
[85:00.02]We can repair the RV now.
[85:02.29]My knees.
[85:04.64]Yeah, my knees in real life.
[85:08.11]Vinny.
[85:09.96]Yeah.
[85:10.71]You're doing great.
[85:11.85]We'll just keep spamming launch each other, Vinny.
[85:19.64]coffee.
[85:24.53]What the hell was the Thanksgiving bit?
[85:27.52]I'm going to 3, 2, 1 you, and right before you get launched, you pick me up.
[85:30.87]Ready?
[85:31.76]3, 2, 1, launch game.
[85:35.26]I couldn't do it.
[85:35.93]I couldn't do it.
[85:36.55]Maybe there's a way, but I couldn't do it.
[85:39.06]We can revive friends from the gravestone.
[85:40.85]Maybe I don't jump.
[85:41.91]Maybe I don't jump.
[85:42.45]Ready?
[85:43.24]Okay, three...
[85:44.27]Two, one, go.
[85:46.12]I tried.
[85:47.75]I was pressing it.
[85:48.92]Let me mash it.
[85:50.38]Go ahead.
[85:52.34]Three, two, one, go.
[85:56.40]No.
[85:57.27]I couldn't do it with the straight down angle.
[86:02.03]Oh, someone said there's a flip pad.
[86:05.78]You could use it like a catapult.
[86:08.32]Oh.
[86:09.36]Do we need oil in the car?
[86:12.10]I don't know.
[86:14.57]I just don't know.
[86:15.61]If I just get a plank, I can do it.
[86:18.00]Don't do that.
[86:18.50]It's going to explode.
[86:23.34]Repair frame.
[86:25.09]Ooh.
[86:27.31]Can we do that?
[86:28.62]I'm going back to poop rock with the catapult.
[86:32.92]There's nothing up, there's definitely nothing up there.
[86:35.44]Like, it's a waste.
[86:37.43]Is this being repaired?
[86:43.66]Don't say that, bro.
[86:44.36]It's probably the craziest fucking loot.
[86:46.96]There's a legendary up there.
[86:49.39]Just for structural damage?
[86:50.44]Oh, okay.
[86:54.98]Sorry if you hear my chair.
[86:57.15]It's really loud.
[86:58.36]Oh, by the way, one of my favorite parts of the video.
[87:00.57]is, Poke, when you, uh, Ster says, hey, thanks for inviting me.
[87:05.02]And, Poke, you immediately just go, Ster, yeah, sorry, my chair made a noise.
[87:13.32]It's one of my favorite parts.
[87:14.53]That's not a good flip.
[87:18.05]I don't see how those two things relate.
[87:20.26]I'm just reminiscing.
[87:28.33]Oh, it's so weak.
[87:29.87]Check this out.
[87:30.73]Check this out.
[87:31.30]Ready?
[87:31.72]Yeah, fix all this shit up.
[87:33.49]Watch this, watch this.
[87:35.79]Come on.
[87:38.84]Good.
[87:40.55]Wait.
[87:44.01]There we go.
[87:55.87]You just broke my fucking arm and now I have two broken arms and I'm almost dead.
[88:01.35]You broke my grill, Douglas?
[88:04.02]Oh my God, look at me.
[88:07.39]Oh shit, oh my god!
[88:08.40]Rez me!
[88:08.68]Rez!
[88:10.41]Wait, can I- I can revive station.
[88:12.02]Should I do it?
[88:14.57]Uh, maybe?
[88:15.86]I'm here.
[88:17.17]Oh, that brought you back.
[88:19.27]Get that wood in the ground.
[88:20.32]I can do it.
[88:20.76]I can do it.
[88:23.12]You drop it at a 45 degree angle.
[88:25.54]Drop it at a 45 degree angle.
[88:26.89]E.
[88:27.83]then walk up on it and then you pick it up and then do it again are you guys still going up on poop mountain this is an attempt being made here yeah yeah poop mountain will be will be
[88:38.85]Completed.
[88:40.91]If we get on the road, we can actually make a pretty decent amount of progress just going around the lake.
[88:46.88]I really feel like
[88:50.69]Maybe.
[88:53.31]Here we go.
[88:53.91]Watch this.
[88:57.09]Is it your bedtime yet, Stark?
[88:59.94]I'm getting a little tired.
[89:02.61]But it's not my bedtime.
[89:05.40]There's another lake.
[89:06.58]Holy shit, Poke.
[89:08.79]Would you do it?
[89:12.16]Hoke has discovered a miracle.
[89:14.13]What?
[89:14.53]Is you dead?
[89:14.99]Yeah.
[89:17.08]Is you dead?
[89:20.63]What's the miracle?
[89:21.71]It's worth the res.
[89:22.36]I can do it now.
[89:24.57]Do you want me to res you back here?
[89:25.47]No, no.
[89:26.96]I got him.
[89:27.69]I got him.
[89:28.90]I got told this.
[89:29.99]Alright, here we go.
[89:39.09]Dead again?
[89:40.26]Yeah, maybe don't waste the res.
[89:42.95]I got you, I got you.
[89:44.58]Unless we play hardcore mode.
[89:47.05]Oh, man.
[89:48.56]Try it.
[89:49.26]Remember, let it drop a bit.
[89:50.84]45 degree angle when you drop it, under you a little bit, aiming down, walk up on it, and then you pick it up, and then do the same thing.
[90:05.06]This might take a quick second, somebody in chat.
[90:07.05]Well, they got deleted, but it was a good attempt.
[90:09.78]I said at the beginning, I said.
[90:10.80]They're doing this all the time.
[90:12.15]Oh, you're doing it.
[90:13.46]I said in the beginning that if you say like up your ass on anything, I'll read it.
[90:16.80]And I did.
[90:17.30]I actually did.
[90:18.58]It was Jerma.
[90:19.87]Do you think you're going to finish this game tonight?
[90:21.81]Up your ass.
[90:23.62]And I would probably not have read that if he didn't put that at the end.
[90:27.66]And you just, there you go.
[90:30.01]You proved it.
[90:34.14]Oh shit.
[90:35.00]Alright, I'm back.
[90:37.91]Yeah, I don't think I'm getting...
[90:38.89]I'm not getting enough height.
[90:41.26]Alright, let me try that one.
[90:44.38]Yeah, you had it better.
[90:48.62]Guys, I'm ready to drive this RV.
[90:50.18]I don't know about you fucking plank boys.
[90:53.48]Alright, last attempt.
[90:55.25]So you guys are trying to launch?
[90:57.09]Blank Olympics.
[91:02.55]Oh.
[91:02.63]Whoa, that was kind of cool.
[91:11.94]Last try ever.
[91:12.79]Last try ever.
[91:17.71]Oh, I just forgot to pick it up.
[91:20.60]I didn't think, I didn't think that's my first time down here.
[91:24.21]Vinny, you got this.
[91:27.30]Oh,
[91:29.98]Alright, we can just drive up to you guys.
[91:31.20]I don't mind.
[91:33.51]As he runs away.
[91:35.27]Dude, you know Wiz Khalifa's streaming on Twitch?
[91:39.14]I gave him 50 subs and he did a nose dab.
[91:42.05]Wait, does that mean he did nose candy?
[91:46.47]Sugar booger?
[91:47.34]No, he did a weed dab up his nose.
[91:51.66]How do you dab weed up your nose?
[91:53.09]Wait, I don't understand.
[91:53.93]What is this new drug shit?
[91:56.38]like a weed bong hit up his nose ah up his nose does he just do that for 50 so is that his sub goal
[92:06.95]that would hurt you for like a week.
[92:08.88]I think, sorry to be a narc, but I don't think Twitch lets you self-harm for subs.
[92:15.07]Apparently, I don't know.
[92:16.85]Maybe he would argue he's not self-harming.
[92:18.46]He's self-enjoying.
[92:19.97]He has a little...
[92:21.61]Yeah, it's like a special tool that goes in his nose, like a little tube.
[92:25.13]It's like a bong that's normal for the nose.
[92:27.96]Oh, he's got a snorkel.
[92:30.21]Yeah, apparently that's a thing.
[92:32.58]People do nose bong hits now.
[92:35.15]I learned so many new things in these streams.
[92:37.82]Yeah.
[92:39.28]Boofing sub goal when?
[92:40.82]Yeah, I gotta up...
[92:41.97]I gotta...
[92:43.52]I got to get a sub goal, period.
[92:46.82]How are we doing this?
[92:49.93]Let's drive.
[92:52.68]This thing is fucking wedged in here, by the way.
[92:54.97]I don't think this is coming out.
[92:57.07]Oh, it's definitely... Yeah, there you go.
[93:01.52]Careful, careful, careful, careful, careful, careful.
[93:03.15]Too much.
[93:05.07]Dude!
[93:05.91]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, careful there, sir.
[93:08.16]Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[93:11.11]Alright.
[93:12.49]Making way too much nose hits, sir.
[93:14.74]There's a box!
[93:16.03]I'm dying.
[93:16.47]Alright, we have to go...
[93:20.54]Can I get in the car?
[93:23.81]Wait, wait, let me get to the car.
[93:29.84]Well...
[93:32.05]If you had the rat voice, that would have been funnier.
[93:35.40]See, it was funnier.
[93:40.05]He was right.
[93:41.38]Yeah, I'm thinking of becoming a rat streamer permanently.
[93:46.92]I keep thinking about that rat game.
[93:49.67]Are we all ready?
[93:50.58]I feel like I dreamed that we played that.
[93:52.33]Does anybody else feel that way?
[93:53.92]That didn't feel real, honestly.
[93:55.83]I don't think any of us were even attempting to pay attention to that thing.
[93:59.72]I was enjoying it.
[94:00.51]They were all nervous about when the fucking video was gonna start.
[94:03.40]I was thinking about the video the whole time.
[94:05.36]Yeah, it's like, alright, when are we doing the video?
[94:07.27]I couldn't wait.
[94:08.23]I couldn't wait.
[94:13.43]Who's not in the car?
[94:14.73]Oh, where am I?
[94:15.05]Who's driving?
[94:15.53]Ster.
[94:16.42]Oh, boy.
[94:17.66]Alright.
[94:20.11]Then I'm done.
[94:21.64]What?
[94:22.47]You're going to hit me with that?
[94:23.90]Let's see you do it, big man.
[94:25.33]He doesn't even know where he's going.
[94:28.14]I'm going to scout first.
[94:29.95]Just threw the cigarette at me.
[94:32.65]We're not driving over this.
[94:37.54]Are you crazy?
[94:37.98]We're doing a turn.
[94:38.72]We're doing a turn here.
[94:39.55]We're going that way, right?
[94:40.87]Okay.
[94:42.05]I think we might need to winch.
[94:43.30]This is going to be very hard without winching.
[94:47.35]Wenching?
[94:48.59]I don't even know.
[94:50.32]Speaking of, do you know what?
[94:51.58]Oh, scrap down here.
[94:54.97]That's where another RV must have crashed.
[94:56.98]Have you guys heard the term whinging?
[94:59.16]Yes.
[95:00.20]No.
[95:00.86]What's that all about?
[95:01.60]They say that in British.
[95:03.19]Yeah.
[95:04.09]It's an English term where if you whinge, you're just a complainer.
[95:07.88]You're like a whiner.
[95:10.51]What about Garry's Mod, Minge?
[95:13.75]No, I think Minge is a... Is that a slur?
[95:18.26]No, not a slur.
[95:19.14]Oh my god, fuck.
[95:20.61]It means pussy.
[95:22.11]I'm scared the fuck out of me.
[95:23.42]Wait, is it bad?
[95:23.82]No, you're good.
[95:25.81]Okay.
[95:26.21]every listen every word in another language is like a potential minefield anyway so even if you say something like that's bad alright so I just yeah it's okay
[95:36.20]Am I cutting this right now?
[95:38.79]Do anybody have the winch?
[95:39.93]You're cutting this?
[95:40.57]I have it winched up so that you have a safety net.
[95:43.40]Who has the winch controller?
[95:44.97]I don't know how that works.
[95:46.50]Okay, so don't tell me we're good to winch.
[95:49.96]Vinny, get the winch.
[95:52.43]The witch is on the- Now.
[95:54.22]Dude, just drive and go left, bro.
[95:56.13]You're not gonna fall.
[95:57.97]Okay?
[95:58.26]You're gonna be fine.
[95:59.50]Just go.
[96:01.48]Just go.
[96:03.31]Left.
[96:03.88]Left.
[96:06.64]Left.
[96:08.19]Hey, excellent.
[96:10.22]Alright, drop that winch.
[96:11.48]Yeah, man.
[96:12.21]Yeah, man.
[96:13.35]Feeling pretty good.
[96:14.51]Alright, going up the hill.
[96:16.32]You got it.
[96:16.68]I'm scouting ahead.
[96:17.74]Going up the hill.
[96:19.23]Up the hill?
[96:20.33]Up the hill?
[96:20.61]Aragorn jumped up the hill.
[96:22.70]Aragorn jumped up the hill.
[96:25.75]Yeah, yeah.
[96:27.19]Oh, and then we have a...
[96:30.03]Holy shit.
[96:30.68]That was like a real California bridge up here.
[96:35.85]What do I do about the bridge?
[96:37.64]Keep coming.
[96:38.65]Keep going?
[96:39.87]Keep going.
[96:41.04]I'm gonna scout ahead a little bit.
[96:42.06]You'll see.
[96:44.19]Remember to smoke your cigarette so you can run faster.
[96:47.12]Don't drive over the spot where I am.
[96:50.11]Let's just not do any of that, okay?
[96:52.24]Yeah, you're right.
[96:53.14]I agree with you, Poke.
[96:54.25]The spot here looks like it'll break.
[96:56.27]So, what would you have me do?
[96:58.54]Go to the right?
[96:59.08]Come down this side.
[97:01.63]Uh...
[97:03.02]I'm gonna be real with you.
[97:05.60]I think you can make it.
[97:08.94]Uh, safety winch?
[97:11.77]No.
[97:11.89]Winch?
[97:12.59]Do I just kind of have to gun it over that?
[97:14.40]Yeah, you know what?
[97:15.00]No, no, safety winch.
[97:15.88]Yeah, safety winch.
[97:16.85]No, no, no, no.
[97:17.75]I think you can do it.
[97:18.53]Gun it.
[97:18.93]Wait, wait, wait.
[97:20.52]Don't just say that.
[97:21.35]Do you see the rim?
[97:22.35]I see it, but I'm not going to be lined up for that.
[97:25.16]I think we can hit this.
[97:26.79]I need to make it into the car.
[97:29.54]I need to get my wheels lined up.
[97:32.16]Okay, you need to hit this full speed.
[97:34.68]Hold on.
[97:35.10]I'm not going to do it.
[97:35.81]I'm not going to just worm over it.
[97:37.95]Guys, I say I say you got to make this.
[97:40.68]You got to go for it.
[97:41.58]I'm going to die.
[97:42.35]This is what the four horsemen is all about.
[97:44.15]I got four H. If.
[97:49.22]I'm laughing, hold on, hold on.
[97:52.47]Can you throw the winch to me?
[97:54.34]The pole?
[97:56.31]Alright, you gotta tell me, are my wheels lined up on this?
[97:59.67]How do I?
[98:00.17]Straighten me out.
[98:00.86]No.
[98:01.00]Not even close.
[98:01.72]Not even close.
[98:02.22]Can you throw that start?
[98:03.23]Yeah.
[98:05.36]Good throw.
[98:05.78]Good throw.
[98:08.75]Alright, you got a safety net.
[98:11.18]One of you guys get on the winch, and that way, if there's a terrible jump malfunction,
[98:16.27]Okay, I'm on it.
[98:17.84]I need some wheels.
[98:19.53]Follow my hands.
[98:20.31]Okay, I need some wheel help here.
[98:23.80]Out of the wheels.
[98:24.78]To the left, okay?
[98:25.95]More?
[98:26.32]it looks good it looks good you need to know it's not a little bit a little bit a little bit more a little bit more to the left yeah your body's coming in the wrong angle your body's gonna turn the body more
[98:36.27]Turn the body more.
[98:37.76]I got to back up.
[98:38.22]Turn the body more.
[98:38.68]I got to back it up.
[98:39.50]Turn the body more.
[98:41.63]Are you saying to the left?
[98:44.62]Turn the body more.
[98:46.87]You want me to go to the left like this?
[98:48.49]I want you to fucking do it already.
[98:53.21]I- no, Polk, you were my absolute shining star.
[98:55.95]You were helping me so much.
[98:56.83]Stirr wants me to lose.
[98:59.16]Is this lined up, Stirr?
[99:00.96]Yes.
[99:01.66]No, you liar.
[99:02.89]That was a fake.
[99:03.33]That was a lie.
[99:05.06]That was a lie.
[99:07.11]That was a lie.
[99:08.05]Yes.
[99:09.55]You look, Jerma, from here, you look lined up to me.
[99:12.62]Okay, alright, alright.
[99:13.46]Someone get on the winch.
[99:14.43]Someone get on the winch.
[99:15.53]No one fucking believes Stirr.
[99:17.52]How far back can I go, Stirr?
[99:19.98]I believe in Ster.
[99:22.33]Can I keep going Ster?
[99:23.36]You told me that this is a scary thing behind me.
[99:26.88]You go back a little bit more, Jerma.
[99:28.12]Don't worry about that.
[99:29.85]Someone get on the winch.
[99:30.63]The winch is not letting me go any further than this.
[99:32.68]Go, yeah.
[99:33.30]You gotta go.
[99:33.76]I think it's because I'm stuck under the car.
[99:35.41]We ready?
[99:36.23]Wait, no, no, no, I'm stuck under the car.
[99:38.29]Don't go, okay.
[99:38.92]Yeah, okay, now go.
[99:40.18]Go, go, go, go, go.
[99:40.88]Wait, wait, Poke is under the car.
[99:42.00]Go, go, go, go, go.
[99:42.97]I think we should remove the winch.
[99:44.07]I think the winch is a bad idea.
[99:44.73]Just do it.
[99:45.11]The winch is going to pull it back.
[99:46.13]The witch is gonna... Oh, yeah.
[99:54.61]At least the car's not ruined.
[99:56.44]Look at this.
[99:57.67]At least we could save this.
[100:00.22]There was no speed!
[100:02.82]There was no speed on that at all!
[100:06.06]I don't think we should pull it up.
[100:11.39]Should we just drop it slow?
[100:13.46]We're going up.
[100:14.12]I mean, it's coming up.
[100:16.51]Dude, you were in first gear.
[100:18.66]Don't say that.
[100:20.60]You were in first gear.
[100:22.63]Oh, yeah.
[100:22.83]You should have called me back.
[100:23.99]And then go boom.
[100:24.35]Don't you...
[100:27.14]That was pretty funny looking though.
[100:28.89]Who put the winch?
[100:29.72]It was very cool.
[100:31.15]Why do we keep the winch on it?
[100:33.54]The witch was pulling me back.
[100:34.93]That's why I asked like three times.
[100:37.72]No, the winch has a limit of 50 meters.
[100:41.92]First gear full speed.
[100:43.11]I was going like 22 miles per hour.
[100:45.11]I don't even know.
[100:47.95]Oh my god, it worked!
[100:50.60]No way!
[100:52.31]Alright, unwinch me.
[100:54.16]Back up wind strength.
[100:55.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:56.37]Get ready to drive.
[100:57.01]Get ready to drive.
[100:57.57]You ready?
[100:57.81]I'm driving.
[100:58.10]I'm driving.
[100:58.38]I'm driving.
[100:59.24]Go.
[100:59.98]Oh, we are clean.
[101:02.89]No, we're not.
[101:03.63]We're clean.
[101:04.30]You got it.
[101:04.86]You got it.
[101:05.50]Fuck yeah, dude.
[101:06.27]Oh, hell yeah.
[101:06.79]Alright, so let's not be in first gear and...
[101:11.64]The winch was...
[101:12.46]I gotta turn this around.
[101:13.25]...safe.
[101:13.63]The reason we won.
[101:15.14]The winch was both a detriment and it saved it.
[101:18.59]But it also was a detriment probably.
[101:21.51]I think without the winch, we still would have crashed.
[101:25.31]Every single panel on this vehicle is now gone.
[101:28.81]Like, every single one.
[101:31.67]Oh.
[101:32.37]So... That's not great.
[101:35.40]Am I...
[101:35.72]I got clearance here?
[101:37.41]There's no mirrors.
[101:38.21]I don't know if there's clearance.
[101:40.36]There's clearance if you just cut a left.
[101:43.25]Oh, okay, fine.
[101:44.58]Jerma... Jerma, you're sliding!
[101:47.69]Jerma, it's sliding!
[101:48.82]There's a cliff!
[101:49.44]Jerma, there's a cliff!
[101:50.85]Jerma!
[101:51.59]Jerma, stop!
[101:52.84]Is there actually a cliff?
[101:55.48]You are a dick, man.
[102:05.10]Where are you going?
[102:06.45]I'm turning it around.
[102:07.79]No, no, you're going the wrong way.
[102:11.85]You're going the complete opposite direction.
[102:13.64]Whoa, whoa, guys, we made the jump?
[102:16.15]Turn left.
[102:16.93]Yes!
[102:20.42]Yes, we made the jump!
[102:23.75]Did you black out?
[102:24.47]I tied the winch to the opposite side!
[102:26.24]I thought you tied it to the other side!
[102:28.12]I thought you tied the winch to...
[102:30.02]We did it.
[102:30.77]We did the jump.
[102:32.16]Oh, hey, we did it.
[102:33.49]Excellent work, everybody.
[102:38.88]I thought you pulled me up on the other side of where the jump was.
[102:42.60]was the best reaction time yeah dude that was like a five minute late realization
[102:50.04]Dude, we did it.
[102:50.80]Nice job, everybody.
[102:52.57]Are you high?
[102:53.21]No, I'm doing fine.
[102:57.30]Don't hit me.
[102:58.08]I have a broken bone already.
[103:04.42]Dude, your brain's in first gear.
[103:05.80]My brain operates at maximum capacity in first gear, okay?
[103:17.88]And I feel bad.
[103:19.35]You never got ahead a little bit.
[103:22.34]Never get the chill out.
[103:23.83]Damn.
[103:24.72]Well, I guess permanent first gear is permanent chill out, isn't it?
[103:29.24]100% at first gear.
[103:30.62]You just can't.
[103:31.27]So how do you go past zero?
[103:33.39]Under one, you're just dead.
[103:35.46]Done.
[103:36.56]That's true.
[103:37.10]Sleep.
[103:38.96]You want to have some gears.
[103:41.19]Sometimes you need a gear.
[103:48.43]like this game a lot this is fun yeah it got really engrossing it's pretty gross
[103:56.31]Just needs music.
[103:57.27]It just needs some sound.
[103:59.04]It's on the radio.
[104:00.26]It needs some tuber noises.
[104:02.67]Do we have any actual food besides beer?
[104:05.00]Beer!
[104:05.52]Beer!
[104:05.86]Bear?
[104:06.28]There's no door.
[104:07.97]Oh, bear.
[104:08.50]Oh my god.
[104:09.24]Oh my god.
[104:17.33]How do you punch?
[104:20.04]I don't think you're punching.
[104:22.61]Well, it's push, that's push, yeah.
[104:23.89]Yeah, is there a punch?
[104:26.26]Not really.
[104:27.38]He took the ceiling off.
[104:30.25]Did anyone bring the bear spray?
[104:31.67]There was bear spray in the fucking garage.
[104:36.01]Are you gonna wing it?
[104:44.99]Oh my god.
[104:46.49]Shit.
[104:47.40]Hold on, I'll save you.
[104:48.10]Hold on, the second part.
[104:50.29]What about the second part?
[104:51.82]Oh god.
[104:55.44]No one locked the cabinet, so it fell out.
[104:58.18]Oh my god, we fucked that up so bad!
[104:59.97]You guys did that perfectly!
[105:03.20]Can we even get it?
[105:05.22]Oh, mine's good.
[105:08.64]This needs to be here still.
[105:11.60]We might need to winch.
[105:12.94]I got a good wood, wood, wood.
[105:14.40]Shitload of scrap down here.
[105:17.41]I don't think we need wood in the back, we just, I think we just go for it.
[105:19.52]We just need the wood in the front and then gun it.
[105:25.52]There's a scrap apparently in the ravine.
[105:27.13]I got it.
[105:31.39]That looks good.
[105:33.84]You got to drive this time.
[105:34.95]You haven't done a risky maneuver in a bit.
[105:38.07]Yeah, Vinny, you should take this one.
[105:40.34]Alright.
[105:41.66]Uh-oh.
[105:42.26]The wood does not solve the front of this.
[105:46.77]Are we lined up?
[105:47.71]I'm very concerned about the back tires.
[105:50.40]The back tires are...
[105:51.31]This is very concerning.
[105:52.21]This guy's going to get stuck.
[105:53.12]Let me line this one up.
[105:56.84]I think we need a piece of wood here too.
[105:58.37]Jerma, Jerma.
[106:00.98]Stop.
[106:02.33]Wait.
[106:03.46]Oh, good.
[106:05.24]Oh.
[106:07.15]Let's go.
[106:08.03]Oh my god.
[106:11.31]This guy's a doubter through and through.
[106:13.19]No, I was just trying... Look at how far we've...
[106:17.95]This is game progress, man.
[106:19.93]You don't bring me to the horror place.
[106:22.14]You don't bring jermaOn a road trip.
[106:25.58]I would be the best person to take on a road trip.
[106:27.74]I'm so calm and calculated.
[106:28.92]You had a good time at the horror place, though.
[106:30.35]You did.
[106:32.18]Okay.
[106:33.60]In real life, I'd be sitting there like, I'm going to check my mirrors.
[106:36.47]Everybody have any food?
[106:37.22]Everybody have soda?
[106:38.67]I actually am one head away from dying.
[106:39.75]Don't do that.
[106:41.68]Yeah, me too.
[106:42.86]I'm also one head away.
[106:51.06]Oh, Jerma, you're a fucking cutie.
[106:54.48]Thanks.
[106:55.36]Thanks.
[106:57.97]We got another body of water coming up.
[107:05.17]Do we have healing items?
[107:07.48]We might.
[107:08.05]Hold on.
[107:08.87]In the fridge, maybe?
[107:09.78]That was burger, maybe granola.
[107:12.73]We have a grill.
[107:14.12]There's beer.
[107:15.62]There's a power pole.
[107:18.21]Which I don't know what the hell that even is.
[107:21.27]There's the engine.
[107:25.86]Dude, look at Poke.
[107:27.51]He's flying.
[107:29.12]Holy shit.
[107:29.80]Holy shit, he's doing it.
[107:31.03]What?
[107:32.15]How did you do that?
[107:38.77]That's insane.
[107:41.30]He lost it.
[107:43.14]Better land in the water.
[107:45.47]I'm good.
[107:46.58]Are you alive?
[107:47.54]You're not.
[107:47.88]You're not moving.
[107:50.13]He made it.
[107:52.00]Oh, he did make it.
[107:52.78]Wow.
[107:53.36]Okay.
[107:53.50]This is a scary drop here.
[107:58.95]Did it look cool?
[107:59.60]It looked awesome.
[108:01.78]That was amazing.
[108:08.27]I feel like we could wench across to the left instead of going down there and doing whatever it wants us to do.
[108:17.19]I feel like you don't need to do that.
[108:20.71]He seems very powerful.
[108:23.34]Does anyone know what Jack's power pole is?
[108:25.58]I don't know, but we have one.
[108:28.09]I've got one.
[108:29.19]We can winch down, too.
[108:30.52]People are saying we can just winch down.
[108:38.19]Are we stuck?
[108:39.03]I think we can...
[108:40.03]I think we could just drive down there.
[108:42.49]No, I'm saying I don't think we should even go forward.
[108:45.44]Why?
[108:46.22]hold up look look over we we attached to the tree over here there's a road down there guys
[108:52.92]No, guys, you guys are not listening to the...
[108:55.76]There is a road.
[108:58.35]I want to look at the map.
[109:02.19]I want to look at the map.
[109:05.07]I can explain it.
[109:07.14]It goes down the hill, and then we have to do some weird bridge puzzle.
[109:11.28]Or... No, we cannot do this.
[109:13.47]Never mind.
[109:14.10]Here, poke.
[109:14.96]Take a look.
[109:15.90]See the map?
[109:17.42]You can ride down the hill then.
[109:19.47]Yeah, we're going down the hill.
[109:21.06]We have to kind of go around this body of water.
[109:23.37]Yeah, I might be stuck now.
[109:25.59]Hold on.
[109:26.17]Oh yeah, you are stuck.
[109:27.34]Your right back tire is not on the ground.
[109:40.10]I'm trying to pull him.
[109:42.15]I have nothing I can attach to here.
[109:46.22]You have Austin Powers in the ravine.
[109:50.39]What?
[109:51.76]You are perfectly there.
[109:57.34]I mean, I don't want to rip them up.
[109:59.18]Drink a beer and push it.
[110:02.02]I guess I should pull him back?
[110:07.34]Like, I look away for a couple seconds, and I turn back, and this is happening.
[110:12.57]I'm gonna let it go.
[110:13.25]I don't think this is helping.
[110:15.54]Push it.
[110:16.06]Push it.
[110:20.21]Attach it.
[110:21.72]What are you doing?
[110:23.52]He told me to push it.
[110:24.91]Attach.
[110:26.05]To what?
[110:27.08]The tree?
[110:28.40]Yeah, you could do a tree.
[110:29.71]Well, winch it.
[110:45.00]This car's about to explode.
[110:50.04]Alright, cut the wheel to the left hard.
[110:53.47]And unwinch.
[110:54.23]And unwinch.
[110:54.70]Go.
[110:57.10]This back right tire does not, you're kind of doing it though.
[110:59.69]Can we, do we have any boards?
[111:00.72]Here, hold on, wait.
[111:03.03]What if we do this?
[111:04.43]Like give him something to like actually be that back wheel on.
[111:12.79]Okay, your back wheel's on the ground now.
[111:15.99]There you go.
[111:16.33]Wait.
[111:25.15]Come on.
[111:27.16]Let me attach this to something over here.
[111:30.92]Stop winching for a sec.
[111:31.90]Stop winching.
[111:32.89]No.
[111:33.75]Stop winching.
[111:34.29]Oh, yeah.
[111:34.94]No, because it's working.
[111:36.77]It's working because, I mean, the air is a counterweight.
[111:40.76]No, that's not true.
[111:43.47]Alright, winch is off.
[111:52.57]What is this?
[111:53.17]Oh, you're trying to do the flip?
[111:54.49]Careful, careful.
[111:55.36]I would do... Ooh.
[112:00.05]I gotta get in front of you.
[112:02.69]I'm good.
[112:06.33]What?
[112:06.68]I'm dead.
[112:08.04]What?
[112:08.95]I am also dead.
[112:12.72]How?
[112:14.05]I don't...
[112:15.97]How did Jerma die?
[112:17.62]How did you die to Jerm?
[112:18.71]I skipped a little too much.
[112:21.54]There was a little too much skipping.
[112:24.29]We only have one revive.
[112:27.85]Get Jerma back.
[112:30.64]Can we revive Vinny too?
[112:36.69]We can revive Vinny.
[112:38.10]Nah, just get Jerma back.
[112:39.40]I'll come back later.
[112:40.30]Don't worry about me.
[112:41.35]Let's do it.
[112:41.73]Once you make it to a checkpoint.
[112:44.00]No, all four of us have to be here.
[112:45.52]It's a rule.
[112:46.00]Where's the winch controller?
[112:47.77]4H.
[112:48.12]I have it.
[112:52.21]Oh, I can't revive.
[112:54.17]Why are you trying to... Why are you trying to pull it that way?
[112:58.48]I'm making it easier to, like, run his head over.
[113:01.63]Good, no.
[113:03.85]Oh boy, I'm sorry Vinny.
[113:08.95]Grab the fucking flip device, I had that.
[113:12.12]It was an accident.
[113:12.91]I got rid of it.
[113:16.45]What the fuck am I stuck on now?
[113:19.09]Uh, you're...
[113:19.99]Hold on, let me attach you.
[113:21.82]Let's get you on this tree.
[113:23.69]Winch him forward.
[113:26.56]We need a forward winch.
[113:30.35]Who has the winch in their hand?
[113:32.32]No one.
[113:32.94]Oh, no one.
[113:33.54]Hold on.
[113:35.41]Do it forward?
[113:36.86]It's in the back here.
[113:37.50]I got it.
[113:44.89]You good?
[113:45.47]Bear.
[113:46.42]Yeah.
[113:47.76]Alright, release that winch.
[113:48.93]Bear, bear coming.
[113:51.23]What the fuck?
[113:51.92]That's not bears.
[113:52.94]How do I turn the winch?
[113:54.31]How do I get the winch off?
[113:55.11]I can't release it.
[113:57.04]Oh, God.
[113:59.53]I can't release it.
[114:00.47]R?
[114:04.23]Moose!
[114:06.54]Get this wench off me!
[114:07.74]He's proper sick of the game.
[114:09.15]Dude, I'm not...
[114:10.98]playing what the hell happened to this I'm just just watching there's a moose uh you have a moose on your head oh
[114:19.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[114:19.63]I gotta get that winch.
[114:21.48]Oh, the book stopped driving.
[114:25.30]You ran over a moose.
[114:27.44]How did you kill multiple moose-sci?
[114:29.77]Whatever they are.
[114:30.43]They drove into me.
[114:34.40]You fucked this up so badly as soon as I started driving?
[114:36.93]What?
[114:37.80]Who wants to drive?
[114:38.52]That's Ster doing that, not me.
[114:41.14]What?
[114:43.56]Checkpoint.
[114:44.11]We can rez.
[114:49.24]Oh.
[114:50.43]Is there food in here too?
[114:51.49]Oh, there better be.
[114:52.56]Is there a rez?
[114:53.84]There should be, you know, there's no cemetery.
[114:58.01]There might be a revive in here though.
[115:02.67]I didn't see one, I looked.
[115:05.22]What?
[115:05.96]I was looking everywhere.
[115:07.41]New music.
[115:11.24]Burgers.
[115:14.38]Cheeseburger, yeah!
[115:19.60]Why are we... Why are we going backwards?
[115:22.87]That was winch music.
[115:27.89]Wait, it's the same song?
[115:29.96]Apparently, we can revive at checkpoint, and it's a free revive.
[115:34.98]Oh, yeah, do that.
[115:36.89]Is this a checkpoint?
[115:39.62]I'm dead and still have a lit cigarette in my mouth.
[115:41.79]We should be right here, right?
[115:47.99]Everyone needs to turn their mic off.
[115:49.02]I'm back, I'm back.
[115:49.74]Toggle your mics.
[115:50.30]I'm back, I'm back.
[115:52.53]Hello, hello?
[115:52.85]My microphone is toggled.
[115:54.94]Wow.
[115:55.32]We're good, hey.
[115:55.89]Alright.
[115:57.16]We should cook these burgers.
[115:59.67]Yeah.
[116:00.73]It's funny because I still have low health.
[116:04.95]That's not funny.
[116:06.91]It's kind of funny.
[116:09.14]Is there a grill?
[116:10.50]Or do we use the one we have?
[116:12.17]We have a grill.
[116:13.83]We can use it.
[116:15.16]We do.
[116:17.08]We also, if there's ever bear spray, just be sure to keep that.
[116:22.55]There you go.
[116:23.41]Alright.
[116:24.19]I'm going to put the grill down right here outside.
[116:29.05]Where are those burgers?
[116:29.77]Oh my God, what is this?
[116:35.82]Use the welder.
[116:37.49]Where's those burgers?
[116:42.77]you have to repair the car I think the only thing that matters for repairing the car is you get to watch it explode again where are the burgers well that and also you can go stand on the roof
[116:54.50]I got a grill going.
[116:55.28]Where's the burgers?
[116:58.58]Does anyone have... Where were the burgers?
[116:59.98]There was Berg?
[117:01.65]They were on the ground, so we had to pick them up.
[117:08.38]I got a res and a scrap metal.
[117:12.49]Did anybody pick up those burger patties?
[117:13.86]There was a stack of them on the ground.
[117:15.74]No.
[117:16.71]What?
[117:17.51]So where are they?
[117:18.86]Yeah, what happened to them?
[117:21.19]Did we lose them on the restart?
[117:24.28]I guess we did.
[117:29.74]Can you weld burgers?
[117:30.84]I think you could probably weld burgers.
[117:34.14]Oh, it refreshed the loot pool.
[117:36.00]We lost our burgers on the ground.
[117:38.39]That's so unfortunate.
[117:41.35]Oh, so it's random loot per checkpoint?
[117:45.26]Are we ready?
[117:46.08]This grill is crazy.
[117:49.13]Get on the ferry.
[117:50.80]Alright, so we have to get this on here.
[117:54.17]You can get extra repair scraps if someone walks to a save point and loots it before the RV arrives.
[118:01.11]Ah.
[118:02.87]Ah.
[118:05.47]This is, uh, this is like in every Resident Evil co-op game.
[118:08.90]There's one of these.
[118:09.53]Yep.
[118:12.56]Alright, we good?
[118:14.37]Yeah, I think you might need to drive with it.
[118:20.12]Oh God, I might drive with it.
[118:21.71]Drive with it.
[118:23.59]Yep.
[118:31.02]Why don't we just go on the rocks?
[118:33.81]You alright?
[118:35.90]You good?
[118:37.15]Yeah, shut up.
[118:37.93]What do you want?
[118:42.60]You don't need to drive with it, I'm being told, but let's... Yeah, I don't.
[118:45.63]It's pulling it.
[118:47.16]Okay.
[118:47.98]Is there room to turn right or am I going to fall in the water?
[118:50.39]Turn right now.
[118:51.07]You can turn.
[118:51.69]You good?
[118:57.33]Okay, can you move are you good man?
[119:00.12]Yeah, I'm trying I Did it's as far as I can go
[119:07.32]Hold it, you gotta hold it.
[119:11.09]No, don't gun it into the water!
[119:12.36]You freaking dumb guy!
[119:17.53]You good?
[119:22.60]Seems good.
[119:24.23]No.
[119:26.05]The names I was called will stay with me for a while.
[119:28.96]This trail is pretty bad, however.
[119:32.38]As good as we are...
[119:34.29]We're not going to be good enough.
[119:35.65]I believe Ster could do this.
[119:37.88]Ster?
[119:39.93]Are you good?
[119:42.66]Nobody's asked if I'm good, which is kind of irritating We know you're good
[119:52.85]Dermot, when was the last time you fucking bathed?
[119:58.35]Uh, like seven or eight hours ago?
[120:02.82]We may need a wench pole here.
[120:05.15]I'll get it.
[120:06.56]To make this easy.
[120:09.05]Depends.
[120:09.83]I got you.
[120:10.39]I got you one.
[120:11.09]Oh, I know what the wench pole is now.
[120:12.71]I can't get the limit.
[120:14.92]How far can you take it?
[120:15.85]How far can you push it to the limit?
[120:17.15]Right there?
[120:17.86]Yeah.
[120:19.42]I can't get in the RV.
[120:27.05]It's hard to get in the RV.
[120:29.02]Somebody get on the winch.
[120:30.85]The winch is in there and none of us are going to be able to get up here.
[120:36.91]I wish I cried longer in the video.
[120:41.38]I think randomly crying was good.
[120:47.49]Be careful with that.
[120:49.96]Max, Eugene.
[120:50.58]I need someone to get on the winch.
[120:52.67]Somebody's winching it right now.
[120:55.14]I'm winching.
[120:57.21]Stop now.
[121:00.47]Can we disconnect it?
[121:03.34]Okay, you need to go there.
[121:04.95]Winch is being disconnected.
[121:06.43]Winch is disconnected.
[121:07.36]I hope you're ready for that.
[121:09.41]What if we were four ASMR content creators that just played games together?
[121:13.17]Attaching to a tree.
[121:14.37]Hold on.
[121:14.65]Don't pull it.
[121:15.10]Don't pull it.
[121:15.64]Don't pull the winch yet.
[121:17.34]Don't pull the winch.
[121:19.89]Don't pull the winch.
[121:21.22]Don't pull the winch.
[121:25.10]What is it attached to?
[121:26.01]What's happening?
[121:26.61]It's on me or something.
[121:29.28]Get it off me.
[121:31.99]I can't.
[121:33.19]Oh, I picked you up.
[121:34.20]No, I didn't want to do that.
[121:36.47]Uh, somebody take the winch off of Poke.
[121:39.56]Okay.
[121:39.71]Okay.
[121:43.70]Winch it up.
[121:48.26]Yes.
[121:50.17]Pull on the winch.
[121:52.93]No one's pulling.
[121:53.63]I am getting in there.
[121:54.42]What's the point of this RV car?
[121:55.52]I feel like we're moving, like...
[121:57.83]I'm winching.
[121:58.42]I feel like this trip would be better without the car.
[122:02.41]I agree, but we spent so much money on it.
[122:07.32]Okay, stop wenching.
[122:11.32]Whinge.
[122:12.13]Go, whinge.
[122:13.80]Unleash it, unleash it.
[122:16.84]Unleashing.
[122:18.41]Alright, what's this turn looking like?
[122:21.04]You're just going to come to me.
[122:29.33]This looks crazy.
[122:30.28]It looks like there's poison up ahead.
[122:35.88]That looks unsafe.
[122:37.79]I'm gonna have to take a look.
[122:44.54]Okay.
[122:46.36]Honestly, you guys don't even need the wood.
[122:49.73]Would you guys trust me to try something?
[122:52.20]Just winch it the whole way?
[122:54.14]No, would you trust me?
[122:55.52]I trust Poke.
[122:56.34]Poke is, uh, yeah, 100%.
[122:57.65]You're good to go up the wall?
[122:59.48]Yeah.
[123:00.62]Oh, okay.
[123:02.83]Just wall-ride it.
[123:04.00]Just do it, Ster.
[123:08.62]Watch out for that.
[123:09.48]Is it rock?
[123:10.06]Oh my god.
[123:11.08]Damn.
[123:11.30]You did it.
[123:12.89]Watch out.
[123:13.17]There's a tree in front of you, though.
[123:14.11]Hold on.
[123:14.59]I died picking up a plank, guys.
[123:17.12]I am scared about this.
[123:18.59]I'm winching you.
[123:21.24]I'm going to release the winch.
[123:22.06]You ready?
[123:23.49]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[123:25.90]The winch is helping.
[123:27.44]Okay, we're good.
[123:27.92]We're good.
[123:29.53]So I want to revive dead vineyard sauce.
[123:32.76]Don't worry about it.
[123:33.80]I'm rolled all the way down.
[123:36.31]No.
[123:36.65]That's why we're worried about it.
[123:39.17]Do you just want to, like, stop?
[123:42.18]No, I'm enjoying the experience.
[123:44.13]Okay, as long as you can get me back and it's not a problem.
[123:47.52]Is the car in park?
[123:49.26]Yeah.
[123:50.37]Put it in H!
[123:55.83]Dude, 4-H.
[123:59.71]I like the asmr man I like that that's a good one I like I like when we cut it shorter and we call it the four horse
[124:08.67]Hey, Paulie, you want to go down to the bottom wing?
[124:12.34]The four horses are there.
[124:15.32]I'm still winched, aren't I?
[124:16.75]No, you are not winched.
[124:20.13]Something's turning me to the right.
[124:21.78]Like, I think I'm on a safety windshield.
[124:24.76]I'm winching you right now.
[124:26.85]Winch me off.
[124:28.59]Somebody needs to have that winch in their hand.
[124:32.13]I don't know.
[124:35.22]I think we're overly winching.
[124:36.87]when in reality, careful driving would be enough.
[124:40.26]Okay, we're good.
[124:41.07]Release winch.
[124:45.97]Okay, Vinny who is just dying and rolling down hills has some commentary for us on how he thinks things should be done.
[124:51.69]We definitely need to settle the differences here for a second because this is a turn that could go ugly.
[125:02.29]You trust me to drive this real quick?
[125:05.12]I do, actually.
[125:07.09]Do you want to?
[125:08.20]Yeah, I'm not scared.
[125:09.68]I'm not scared.
[125:11.48]Are we resetting the winch or what?
[125:14.19]Do you want winch or do you want no winch?
[125:15.88]No, he's smoking and he's going for it.
[125:17.08]Watch this.
[125:17.77]You want winch?
[125:19.95]Keep winch, alright.
[125:20.76]Wow, there's nobody winching, is what I'm saying.
[125:24.56]It's a backup winch, just in case.
[125:26.15]Okay, well, you know, panel came off, but that was a little...
[125:28.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[125:29.85]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[125:30.70]Put it in park.
[125:32.96]This is coiled around the other tree.
[125:34.91]Don't drive forward.
[125:35.59]Don't drive forward.
[125:36.17]You're going to slingshot yourself.
[125:38.38]You're turning into Trebuchet right now.
[125:40.15]I got rid of the winch.
[125:41.95]You can just drive.
[125:42.61]You're good.
[125:46.53]You're going to hit a rock.
[125:47.94]It's alright.
[125:48.54]It's alright.
[125:49.04]Just keep going.
[125:49.86]Just keep going.
[125:53.40]Right.
[125:53.74]Turn right.
[125:55.00]Sharp.
[125:56.29]Sharp right.
[125:58.60]Yeah.
[125:58.78]All the way to me.
[126:00.49]Oh.
[126:00.95]To the left.
[126:02.38]You're okay to reverse a little bit.
[126:04.27]Go for a little reverse and then immediately go to the clutch one and then go turn left.
[126:07.78]We might want to winch this.
[126:09.12]You might have to...
[126:09.83]Okay, okay.
[126:10.71]Actually, yes.
[126:11.33]Good.
[126:11.92]Good.
[126:12.44]Perfect.
[126:13.16]Perfect.
[126:13.54]You're good.
[126:13.96]Perfect.
[126:15.61]Excellent.
[126:15.79]Good calls.
[126:16.84]Are we going to fork in the rodeo today?
[126:18.85]Wait.
[126:19.38]Look at the map.
[126:20.28]We need to see where we are.
[126:21.61]It's a bit of a fucking fork in the road, Dan.
[126:24.59]Okay.
[126:25.82]We can go...
[126:26.88]Okay, if we go left...
[126:29.19]It kind of just goes down into a weird ravine.
[126:32.29]If we go right, there is an Omega Bridge.
[126:35.76]Omega Mart.
[126:37.01]Ooh.
[126:38.15]You know the jump?
[126:39.22]I see it, yeah.
[126:40.00]Yeah, you know the jump that's in Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo on the ghost level?
[126:44.65]Where you can have a feather, you can skip everything?
[126:46.80]There's a mine in the road.
[126:48.14]Oh my god.
[126:50.47]Can someone disarm this mine in the road for me?
[126:53.74]Oh!
[126:55.47]Watch out.
[126:56.63]It's been disarmed.
[126:58.20]There's another in front of the... How do you disarm a mine?
[127:02.82]Okay, the omega bridge, we probably do not want to go on.
[127:05.25]You want to go left.
[127:06.87]I think the Omega Bridge is like...
[127:08.40]I'm not getting an indicator to disarm this.
[127:10.07]You have to avoid it.
[127:11.71]Okay.
[127:13.58]Wait, who the fuck is putting mines in scenic trails?
[127:16.11]Give me a beer.
[127:17.20]I can handle this.
[127:17.79]Give me a beer.
[127:20.29]Hey, Ster.
[127:22.50]Toss me a beer.
[127:23.86]That's how every bad decision has ever started, Jerma.
[127:31.78]Catch.
[127:32.63]Pass me a beer.
[127:34.41]Let me see it.
[127:37.27]That, you, I... You missed.
[127:39.66]You missed.
[127:40.18]That's alright.
[127:40.78]And I know what you were doing.
[127:42.17]I think you come to the bridge, actually.
[127:43.55]Come to the bridge.
[127:44.09]We could do this.
[127:44.60]I think you have to drive around it.
[127:47.20]Ster, actually, can you take a right?
[127:49.60]What about a cigarette?
[127:51.12]Can I take a right?
[127:52.61]Yeah, can you go right instead and go to the bridge thing?
[127:56.03]Okay, well it worked.
[127:56.97]Yeah, I'm on the right path.
[127:58.34]I'm on fire.
[127:59.64]Yeah, I'm on fire too.
[128:01.07]Okay.
[128:01.43]Well, we're alive.
[128:02.17]Watch out!
[128:02.53]Watch out!
[128:02.83]Watch out!
[128:03.15]Watch out!
[128:04.26]Watch out!
[128:05.00]Watch out!
[128:09.80]No way that is the... Where'd that beer go?
[128:14.96]Oh, it's an elevator.
[128:16.73]Yeah.
[128:18.53]PogChamps in chat!
[128:23.44]I know the beer, I got the beer.
[128:25.16]It hit a landmine and it's still intact.
[128:30.59]Oops, sorry, Poke.
[128:36.31]I'm gonna be the guy that presses the button.
[128:42.62]This is what we've all been waiting for.
[128:46.78]Nice work, sweetie.
[128:48.41]You might need a reinforcement on that side.
[128:50.94]Okay.
[128:52.35]Uh...
[128:52.47]Positive reinforcement?
[128:53.57]Well, Ster's doing that.
[128:54.87]You're not quite on it all the way.
[128:57.18]You need to drive a little further.
[129:02.57]A little more.
[129:02.97]A little more.
[129:05.02]Oh boy.
[129:11.10]Did we have to keep doing that?
[129:15.83]Alright.
[129:17.29]Pressing it?
[129:17.72]Let's do it.
[129:18.04]You may elevate.
[129:21.06]Wait, what about us?
[129:23.15]You're supposed to be on here.
[129:25.48]I'm on the elevator with Poke.
[129:29.85]You may drive.
[129:32.22]Do you guys remember in classic WoW, that corner in Ironforge, we could just jump into the corner and go all the way up to the ceiling and jump.
[129:38.65]It was crazy.
[129:39.31]People did it.
[129:39.88]I did
[129:40.00]That was my favorite thing in a while, was going through the maps, finding weird spots.
[129:44.83]Right next to the zones.
[129:46.00]Right next to the fireplace.
[129:46.88]More than leveling.
[129:48.25]Yeah, same.
[129:51.47]Stormwind, a little near the bank.
[129:53.05]You can jump on the lamp and then go through the map.
[129:55.20]Oh, yeah.
[129:56.53]Dude, remember going down?
[130:00.08]Can I please tell my little story or are you going to hold that horn down?
[130:04.63]Dude, when Magni Bronzebeard was down there and you could find the unfinished Ironforge that they left in the game.
[130:10.09]Oh my god, that shit was crazy.
[130:12.04]Yeah.
[130:14.93]Oh, the, oh, the, yeah.
[130:18.40]Or that one unfinished zone, like the Kale something.
[130:22.10]That one whole unfinished zone on the Kalimdor.
[130:25.42]Oh, yeah.
[130:26.27]No, actually, no.
[130:27.91]Was it Eastern Kingdom?
[130:28.73]They were like two or three that were just unfinished and people just kind of jumped over and found them.
[130:33.37]Yeah, hijal.
[130:34.27]Oh, that's just crazy.
[130:36.43]Did I used to love to swim?
[130:38.04]See, no one was talking to the RV driver.
[130:40.39]Apparently I had to keep going up.
[130:41.72]I turned in here.
[130:43.38]You're talking about World of Warcraft right now?
[130:46.32]Are you serious?
[130:47.73]Dremel, were you gonna mention the admin, the...
[130:50.70]the admins island yeah admin island gm island gm island oh yeah imagine that getting paid to have a secret area
[130:59.56]We need to make burgers.
[131:00.29]How do we light this up?
[131:03.64]Oh, you have to hold it and then click it.
[131:06.11]Oh, this thing is like toast.
[131:08.95]This thing's like burnt up.
[131:11.49]Here.
[131:12.10]Here's a fresh one.
[131:15.81]So floaty.
[131:18.02]Alright, burgers coming up.
[131:20.15]Oh my god, there's a super jump coming.
[131:23.87]Why is this guy talking about Nibiru?
[131:27.63]Not like it's in our solar system headed towards Earth.
[131:34.98]Maybe.
[131:37.13]Come get a burger.
[131:38.21]So I heard 20 years ago.
[131:40.06]We got burgers here.
[131:42.93]2001.
[131:46.53]You will see in the beer room.
[131:48.13]2003.
[131:50.22]We'll see.
[131:51.30]Uh, Ster, where are you going?
[131:55.22]Ster, you need to eat.
[132:00.60]Vinny, do you want to split his burger and just not give him one?
[132:06.07]I don't think he putts one anyway, but we got plenty of brokers.
[132:07.93]I don't want, I don't, I have fucking gout.
[132:09.68]You're being really insensitive.
[132:11.79]Poked him.
[132:12.47]Oh my god.
[132:13.33]Guys, ready, ready, ready?
[132:15.23]Get in a circle, get in a circle.
[132:22.81]We gotta be closer.
[132:24.53]Ow!
[132:25.43]Bro, in the air.
[132:30.77]I'm bad at this.
[132:33.12]Okay, Jerma, you're up.
[132:34.08]I'll start it.
[132:34.48]Ready, ready?
[132:35.43]Time to redeem yourself.
[132:37.64]Hey, uh, did we make it across the bridge or not?
[132:40.41]Hey...
[132:41.94]The answer is it's a yes or no question.
[132:43.64]Jeremiah, you're up.
[132:45.16]Everybody up.
[132:47.58]We having like fun on this vacation right now are you having a lot of fucking fun?
[132:52.42]I feel like Chevy Chase
[132:55.21]Hey, well, look at this.
[132:56.59]Look at this.
[132:57.10]You like your little ball?
[132:58.52]No, Ster!
[133:02.33]What are you doing?
[133:03.21]He threw the ball over?
[133:04.34]What an asshole.
[133:07.47]You're next.
[133:08.60]Let me go.
[133:10.68]know I'm going to say what I said in Vegas buzzkill no we hit him with the b
[133:18.68]Go get that medal.
[133:20.89]You ready?
[133:21.51]What do you want?
[133:21.89]You want to do this?
[133:22.47]You're killing me.
[133:23.30]You're killing me.
[133:24.24]This is how I...
[133:25.18]I'm not going to go that far, Poke.
[133:26.35]That's death.
[133:27.15]I want to see what's over here.
[133:28.40]You're a CS:GO master.
[133:30.71]Look at him.
[133:31.77]That's crazy.
[133:34.06]We all need to be in the car for this.
[133:35.42]Or somebody...
[133:36.17]Honestly...
[133:37.09]Somebody should be all the way down there to get a good view of that, because that's going to be absurd.
[133:41.44]What the hell is the lotion?
[133:44.74]Someone take this.
[133:48.35]Got it.
[133:49.71]What is it?
[133:52.97]I just saved the game.
[133:56.09]There's more metal under the bridge.
[133:58.18]Ster.
[134:00.27]That hurt me.
[134:00.85]And I just ate.
[134:01.40]Well, I did eat your hamburger, so whatever.
[134:07.13]Okay, um, are we all in the car for this or do we want somebody outside down there to look at this?
[134:13.11]I'll get a good view.
[134:14.68]Okay.
[134:15.46]Lotion heals your burn damage.
[134:18.12]I'm burning because of the landmine.
[134:20.21]I need that too.
[134:21.04]So where is that lotion?
[134:26.06]Oh, I use it all over myself.
[134:29.68]I hope for the appropriate method.
[134:31.63]I think we have to all be in it
[134:33.71]Like, if it jumps without one of us, I think you're left behind forever.
[134:40.24]Oh my god, are we really doing this?
[134:42.33]Yes, and we want to put it in fifth.
[134:44.94]So we want to drive this a little bit further back.
[134:48.37]You can change your cosmetic on your head if you want.
[134:51.43]If you sit on the toilet.
[134:53.78]Thank you, mods.
[134:56.13]There's probably no point in repairing the vehicle until after the jump, but yeah, we should definitely... What the hell is wrong with me?
[135:04.32]So we all should be in here.
[135:05.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[135:06.20]Can you start the vehicle in fifth chat member?
[135:09.30]You probably need to go 1, 2, 3.
[135:10.93]First to second to third.
[135:12.80]Or can you just do fifth?
[135:13.87]They didn't let me do fifth earlier.
[135:15.30]No.
[135:18.46]Who wants to be the one that takes the wheel?
[135:24.97]We probably all need to be seated for this.
[135:26.81]We can rock, paper, scissors.
[135:29.65]Alright, that works for me.
[135:30.58]Let's rock, paper, scissors for it.
[135:35.55]I'm going to repair a little bit, not much, but someone said this acts as armor.
[135:39.64]It doesn't get completely fucked up.
[135:42.49]Wait, you can rock, paper, scissors in this game?
[135:44.84]Yeah, hold X.
[135:50.00]Hold on, don't go yet.
[135:51.99]Um...
[135:53.17]You guys ran me over.
[135:55.96]Alright.
[135:57.10]We probably all need to be seated for this.
[135:59.66]Shut this guy up.
[136:01.93]Safety is important, especially if we don't...
[136:06.25]I like the window.
[136:06.97]I'll take the window in case I puke.
[136:09.84]You ready?
[136:11.11]Close that door.
[136:12.27]Wait, should I go immediately five?
[136:14.62]I think you gotta go shift from one, two to five, but maybe, or something, I don't know.
[136:20.56]Do we not have a door?
[136:23.75]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!
[136:28.17]Keep it straight, man!
[136:32.74]What?
[136:33.02]Why?
[136:33.37]Where?
[136:39.53]You did it!
[136:40.59]You did it!
[136:41.47]Put it in the park.
[136:42.60]Don't let it roll, don't let it roll.
[136:45.10]It hit on the ceiling and died.
[136:47.43]Why is it going?
[136:49.42]Put it in the park.
[136:50.75]Everybody was up at the front.
[136:53.52]There's a piece on the bridge.
[136:54.49]Someone's gonna get it.
[136:55.35]I can't move.
[136:57.73]Where are you?
[136:58.40]I'm dead on the bridge.
[137:00.40]I thought there was a piece on the bridge.
[137:04.06]What is that over there?
[137:06.76]Oh, it's one of us.
[137:08.05]All three of you are up the front.
[137:11.16]There's gonna be the Graves over here!
[137:12.54]What do you know?
[137:13.24]There's gonna be the Graves to revive us!
[137:15.11]Don't die!
[137:15.75]There's gonna be the Graves!
[137:16.75]The worst throw ever.
[137:18.39]Why did you do that?
[137:21.43]What was the point of that?
[137:22.45]Just to kill another person?
[137:23.64]No, I thought I'd launch him way further.
[137:30.35]Okay.
[137:31.44]I saw the three of you all standing up front.
[137:33.54]You had a great view and I'm in the back and I wanted a better view.
[137:36.51]So I stood up and I hit my head on the ceiling and died and I watched you guys explode.
[137:41.17]My bad, sir.
[137:43.86]Well, it's alright.
[137:44.38]You and Vinny can do it.
[137:46.33]Wait, we have one Epi.
[137:48.42]What if I went down there and got him?
[137:51.04]No, we need two people.
[137:51.99]We need two people.
[137:53.56]Wait, what are you... Who the fuck just... Did you just back into him?
[138:02.18]Wait, where's Vinny going?
[138:04.61]Oh, he hit a checkpoint.
[138:05.54]Is this a checkpoint?
[138:07.14]Yeah.
[138:07.67]Are you dead, Poke?
[138:08.91]The graves are here.
[138:10.85]You can rest.
[138:11.79]Look at all that scrap metal.
[138:12.94]This is awesome.
[138:13.99]Perfect.
[138:15.31]Vinny.
[138:16.89]It's the revs at the top.
[138:18.18]Vinny.
[138:19.46]What just happened?
[138:20.49]Uh-oh.
[138:20.77]You're like the Family Guy train scene right now.
[138:22.46]You gotta be careful.
[138:24.56]Vinny.
[138:25.27]Can you revive us, Poke?
[138:30.28]You're right next to him.
[138:32.07]Oh yeah.
[138:35.02]Yeah, look at all this scrap.
[138:38.93]There you go.
[138:45.45]Dude, we're gonna be able to get the whole car back.
[138:46.97]We got burgers too.
[138:48.02]I'm putting these in the fridge.
[138:53.17]Alright, I need to pee in real life.
[138:57.02]okay look I'll be back in like two minutes I thought that was donkey kong country 64 music
[139:06.39]I'm just going to leave it like this.
[139:07.37]We don't need to go BRB screen.
[139:10.53]Oh, it's the other scene.
[139:12.06]Is it good like that?
[139:13.38]It's good.
[139:29.80]oh yeah look down and do it
[139:42.96]Tell them about the time you saw uncensored vagina in Duke Nukem.
[139:48.32]It's true.
[139:48.84]Now that Jerma's not here, I'll tell you guys about it, but...
[139:52.21]It was actually... Was that your first time?
[139:54.53]It was.
[139:55.74]When was this?
[139:56.20]How long ago?
[139:56.76]About three days ago.
[139:58.74]Oh, shit.
[140:01.29]Just turn off stream, delete everything?
[140:04.24]Uh, no, I mean, it was, you know...
[140:06.45]It was a shitty, corny 3D model, so I think it's okay.
[140:09.72]Yeah, you're fine.
[140:10.59]But yeah, I didn't turn off the stream.
[140:12.66]I think, you know, just careful.
[140:16.24]I think you're fine.
[140:16.98]It was an accident.
[140:18.24]I mean, I didn't intend to see that.
[140:20.27]It's Duke Nukem.
[140:22.06]Dukie Nukie.
[140:24.61]If it's in-game content, you're actually fine, I think.
[140:29.38]Depends.
[140:30.03]That was a problem.
[140:32.15]I got banned on Twitch
[140:34.85]for two times.
[140:37.33]The first time was I was playing a mod
[140:41.80]of a game, I think Serious Sam, and it was a Blade Runner mod.
[140:45.42]And there is a projection, right?
[140:47.93]It was like a video playing on the wall.
[140:50.60]And it was the scene in Blade Runner where Joy's boobies are out.
[140:55.00]There was real boobies from a movie on my stream.
[140:59.81]Booby movie?
[141:01.26]It was about three seconds of booba and I was gone for like three days.
[141:08.31]So I saw I saw like a trailer from a 1980s of and then had some guy's ass in the beach shittiest quality ever He's walking on the beach man his butt
[141:17.31]And I got like a day band.
[141:20.83]I lost a lot of bounties.
[141:22.36]I looked at Haunted by Femboy and no one noticed my stream.
[141:26.98]What?
[141:27.43]Well, first of all, it's probably for the best.
[141:30.07]Second, what was on your stream when that happened?
[141:33.19]Well, I was looking at, it was Steam Next Fest, which I didn't think would have like porn games in it.
[141:40.05]Because I was like, oh, Next Fest demos.
[141:42.12]Oh, what's this?
[141:42.68]Oh.
[141:42.72]And I hovered over it and this girl was like, there was like a popsicle in her mouth, I think.
[141:50.26]And it was fine.
[141:51.28]You didn't get banned.
[141:52.56]Well, I guess it wasn't a girl.
[141:53.64]It was because you were haunted by a femboy.
[141:57.05]Oh, yeah.
[141:57.73]You're connected to a lie detector right now.
[141:59.52]That's OK. That's one game on Steam.
[142:03.29]What poke?
[142:04.35]Have you ever bought a goon game on Steam?
[142:05.94]You're on a lie detector right now.
[142:08.33]I think Honey Pop is really well made and well designed as a match three.
[142:13.36]heard honey pop I've heard good things I wish there were more games like honey pop that weren't honey pop
[142:24.18]Is that like a porn game though?
[142:25.29]That was like one of the OGs, like the original that everyone started talking about, Steam having that kind of stuff.
[142:34.48]Oh, it's 90% of Oregon.
[142:41.16]It's 90% of match three.
[142:46.34]I've never done that stuff.
[142:51.27]I remember Second Life.
[142:53.46]up and on Twitch and that was like a completely different thing after that you ever play house party when it came out yeah
[143:02.15]I played House Party on stream when it came out.
[143:04.92]I streamed it and it was definitely a porn game.
[143:07.25]And then they changed the rules the next day.
[143:09.53]It was so bad.
[143:10.52]I feel like I played that
[143:12.14]What year was that?
[143:17.46]Oh no, maybe I didn't play that.
[143:22.69]I did.
[143:25.78]Huh?
[143:26.92]Oh, yeah, they were around the fire and stuff.
[143:28.77]Yeah, I don't think I really saw very much from it, but.
[143:33.25]All I remember is that you get, like, bring a girl to a room or some shit.
[143:36.10]I don't know.
[143:36.82]It was weird.
[143:41.58]Not the UFO 50 house party, no.
[143:49.21]Who's driving?
[143:51.78]Nerma is really copying me and taking a shit on stream right now.
[143:54.77]That's just insane.
[143:55.68]Like, I just can't do anything.
[144:02.36]Hey, Puck, why are you so distant from your computer right now?
[144:05.49]What are you doing?
[144:07.10]I'm also taking a break right now.
[144:09.76]I'm pissing right now.
[144:10.76]You're taking a break.
[144:11.59]Okay, cool.
[144:12.67]Can you leave the mic open?
[144:14.34]Ster, you're, you're, um, what you doing, pal?
[144:18.41]Driving.
[144:19.74]You know you got something attached to the vehicle, right?
[144:23.04]Of course I know.
[144:25.73]I'm dragging them.
[144:32.18]Can you guys pretend you had a fight right now?
[144:35.04]Yo, Stern, Vinny, can you guys pretend you had an awkward fight?
[144:37.81]I'm just...
[144:39.01]Really, I'm not okay with him.
[144:43.18]Man, I hate when Vinny's in the call with me.
[144:45.91]I didn't like him you guys need to chill you guys like I don't know why you guys are fighting
[144:51.37]What what what happened you guys are like you guys ate each other for what?
[144:54.88]I hand delivered the alien stuff to him and he threw it on the ground and like rubbed into the dirt with his foot Yeah
[145:02.72]That's the part he doesn't tell.
[145:05.14]And then, like, I told him he was a buzzkill.
[145:07.95]Because he was being a fucking buzzkill.
[145:10.07]Wait, Star, you should meet up and open up White Knuckle.
[145:12.94]And we'll just say, like, I don't know what happened.
[145:15.19]He left and played White Knuckle.
[145:18.26]Are you just saying that because you're playing our creators?
[145:21.16]I'm burnt from that game.
[145:23.27]Are you, Polk?
[145:24.01]You're done with it for now?
[145:25.60]A little bit, yeah.
[145:27.60]Let's play tomorrow.
[145:29.75]Okay, I'll play.
[145:33.33]Are you addicted to anything else at the moment or is it just that?
[145:36.88]What's wrong with my character?
[145:38.34]I'm back to playing League with GG right now.
[145:42.08]When I get addicted to a game, it's all I do.
[145:45.30]What is going on?
[145:49.16]We're just talking.
[145:49.88]No, I'm like flying around the map.
[145:53.60]So I play like 300 hours in one month, and then I get really depressed.
[145:58.72]Well, yeah, because...
[146:00.84]I mean, that makes sense to me, Poke, to be fair.
[146:03.91]The depression part of it.
[146:05.00]But I'm good back.
[146:05.69]I'm good now.
[146:06.88]It was only for like a day or two.
[146:08.20]Now, is it depression because the game is no longer providing the thrills, or is it just because you look back and you're like, holy shit, that's 300 hours gone?
[146:17.65]Oh, no, no, no.
[146:18.25]I never care about the gone thing.
[146:19.46]I care about, like, now what?
[146:21.71]The fuck do I do now?
[146:23.62]Goddamn.
[146:24.06]That's life, man.
[146:24.95]That's life, isn't it?
[146:26.37]And that's where it's good to... And also, it's just really bad sleep and...
[146:34.32]I'm doing good, though.
[146:35.35]I'm sleeping now.
[146:36.27]It's nice.
[146:36.82]That's nice.
[146:39.96]listen poke you know I'm only your senior by like a couple years I know this but have you considered like seven instead of eight hours a day
[146:49.49]Sleeping?
[146:50.42]More like seven instead of... Can someone come unhook me?
[146:53.86]Are you talking about games or sleeping?
[146:56.25]Games.
[146:57.13]Let's just pull the wench in.
[146:59.02]Maybe if I had a kid.
[146:59.85]You know what I mean?
[147:00.79]I have a cat now, so I already feel weird.
[147:04.00]Why is this?
[147:04.97]Where are you guys?
[147:05.75]Why am I across the whole game?
[147:07.78]I hooked you and I drove pretty far away you oh my goodness can you just shut the up like yeah we were vibing until you came back
[147:19.48]I came back to be the vibe cleanser.
[147:24.81]Vibe terrorist.
[147:28.08]Somebody pull me in.
[147:30.15]I'm getting sick.
[147:32.32]Can you not walk around?
[147:34.24]I see you bouncing around on the other side of the map.
[147:37.53]You guys remember that ride?
[147:39.67]Holy shit, I'm locking a core memory.
[147:42.71]that sky coaster ride that just dropped you and you flew you were hanging by like a bungee cord like this do you guys ever see one of those yeah
[147:51.19]Those things were insane.
[147:52.63]I would never get on one of those.
[147:56.14]It's a gigantic human pendulum.
[147:58.19]They were terrifying.
[147:59.61]Yeah, I don't think I would want to do that.
[148:01.11]The most fucked up one I did was one called Zumanjaro.
[148:05.98]And it was attached to a giant fucking coaster.
[148:10.39]Did they drive off?
[148:11.46]You just drop.
[148:12.46]I'm dead.
[148:14.03]Wait, I was chilling in the garage.
[148:16.10]Did you guys drive off?
[148:16.90]Are you guys gone?
[148:18.06]Poke, I'm so glad you did that.
[148:20.27]That's amazing you did that, Poke, because now I can actually come back.
[148:24.38]Tell them about the Green Lantern Cockpuncher.
[148:26.93]I don't know if they need to know about that.
[148:29.99]That sounds like a story.
[148:32.14]Just a ride at Six Flags.
[148:34.03]It was a stand-up coaster.
[148:38.98]The harness would punch you in the dick during the ride.
[148:42.37]Why are you running back, Mark?
[148:43.91]I was like a feature.
[148:46.14]I got a feature.
[148:47.76]Oh, I understand what's going on now.
[148:52.36]Ha!
[148:54.10]I wrote it and then later it was a famous coaster.
[148:58.91]And then later I saw people leaving the park and there was one guy that was like, oh, my balls.
[149:03.97]And he was like, the fucking Green Lantern.
[149:05.92]And I was like, yeah.
[149:10.14]Okay, if you're a worker there, how often do you think you hear that?
[149:14.47]Is it something that happens very frequently, you think?
[149:17.30]I don't know.
[149:17.82]They got rid of it.
[149:18.65]So clearly there was, you know, some form of they knew.
[149:23.17]Are you guys the kind of guys who, like, finish a rollercoaster?
[149:26.70]Motor oil.
[149:27.62]Sorry, I just fucked you guys' conversation.
[149:29.53]No, go ahead.
[149:30.63]Are you the kind of guy who likes to, like...
[149:33.75]If you leave a restaurant and you see someone walking in, you're like, oh, that was so good.
[149:37.34]Not to them, but like, so they could hear it.
[149:39.99]Or like prank them, be like, dude, that shit sucked.
[149:42.88]like at a roller coaster like yeah when I'm gatekeeping something really dope I'm like oh that was that was it punched me in the dick the green lantern
[149:50.54]Yeah.
[149:52.19]So that way there's less lines for next time.
[149:53.65]You ever do it on purpose though so people can hear you?
[149:56.52]Yeah.
[149:56.64]No, I've never done that.
[149:58.27]No, I want people to, if I'm at a restaurant or if I'm leaving a restaurant and I know that people are like, oh, can I see a menu?
[150:06.91]I'll be like, oh, the scallops, scallops were, can I talk to the chef?
[150:10.45]Like I'll say that to the receptionist.
[150:13.78]Sorry, I'm speech jamming myself.
[150:15.49]I can't even like say words.
[150:16.83]I did it too.
[150:18.40]I said most are oil.
[150:20.92]If the food's really good, I'll tell them, like, dude, this was amazing.
[150:25.60]You know, I'll say that.
[150:27.58]I feel that.
[150:28.85]Why did I get a... Tell people that it's good.
[150:32.16]Somebody asked why I get a single meatball.
[150:34.58]Vinny, you can go ahead and take over here.
[150:36.91]It was two meatballs.
[150:38.99]We call it the big meatball as a joke, but you did get a single meatball at Carmine's, right?
[150:44.90]Oh yeah.
[150:45.64]It was like a singular meatball.
[150:47.28]It was good shit too.
[150:48.17]It was great.
[150:49.32]That was delicious.
[150:50.20]That meal was fucking...
[150:51.87]I mean, I know that's a New York City thing, but they nailed it.
[150:54.95]They were fantastic.
[150:56.05]But no, at John's Pizzeria, you get a meatball appetizer, and it's two big meatballs.
[151:01.81]So the idea is you split a meatball.
[151:04.88]We call it the big meatball.
[151:06.30]And it's just fucking good.
[151:07.60]It's just really good.
[151:08.75]So good.
[151:10.25]So good.
[151:13.04]You guys, next time you're in New York, if we ever do a thing in New York, Jerm, Ster, poke.
[151:19.02]I thank you for the big meatball.
[151:20.37]I'm so glad you said my name.
[151:21.84]I really thought you were going to leave me out.
[151:23.69]No, no, you're alright.
[151:25.16]You're alright.
[151:26.12]You know what's funny?
[151:27.07]The only times I'd really like meatballs is if it's from a restaurant like that.
[151:32.37]Or the Subway Meatball Sub.
[151:34.29]That's the only two times I like it.
[151:36.69]I hate to agree with you.
[151:39.54]So I won't.
[151:40.71]But I will.
[151:42.79]a nice Italian restaurant or Subway.
[151:45.39]Those are the only two places where I really want to get a meatball.
[151:49.11]It's weird.
[151:50.07]Yeah, I'm not crazy about meatballs in general, but I agree.
[151:53.33]I know what you mean.
[151:55.12]I think they're good with spaghetti.
[151:58.54]I think it's because, like, one is, like, on the zero part of the spectrum.
[152:02.85]Like, Subway's, like, a zero part of the spectrum.
[152:04.40]And then the Italian restaurant's, like, a hundred.
[152:05.82]So, for me, there's, like, no in-between.
[152:08.03]Sorry to cut you off.
[152:08.53]No, no.
[152:10.92]I grew up with Italian food and family that made very good meatballs.
[152:15.15]So for me, I've been chasing that high.
[152:17.46]And I found it a couple times.
[152:19.16]And the Carmine's meatball, I'm sure it was good, but the John's meatball is that.
[152:23.08]It's that good.
[152:24.12]It's so good.
[152:25.05]But I also, here's the thing, I will eat, like, oh, God, I'm a pizza snob, but I'll eat Domino's once a year.
[152:32.53]So I know what you mean about the Subway meatballs.
[152:35.62]I know what you mean.
[152:36.15]There's a bear, bear, bear, bear, bear, bear.
[152:38.40]Is fast food pizza really that bad, though?
[152:41.49]Is fast food pizza, those places really that bad to you, though, if you're a pizza snob?
[152:46.63]No, they're not that bad.
[152:48.24]It's like frozen pizza.
[152:49.96]Yeah, I'll eat that once in a while.
[152:51.33]I like pretty much any pizza.
[152:53.06]Dude, I'm telling you guys right now.
[152:54.22]Oh, shit.
[152:55.59]Where is the RV, by the way?
[152:57.66]I said this last time, right?
[152:59.27]Cauliflower frozen pizza is the move, guys.
[153:02.38]I didn't know you were with me, Vinny.
[153:04.57]I ran all the way here, man.
[153:06.36]You fucking drove off with everybody left behind.
[153:08.94]I haven't seen it in a long time, but Dr. Oetker's frozen pizza was...
[153:13.18]Literally better than most pizza places I've been to.
[153:16.27]And I'm going to get fucking fried for that comment.
[153:19.48]Is that a... Is that a... Dr. Okers?
[153:21.63]Is it cauliflower?
[153:22.57]Dr. Oetker's.
[153:25.61]I haven't seen it.
[153:26.05]I don't think it's a cauliflower crust.
[153:28.13]It's just kind of normal.
[153:29.38]Like a regular.
[153:30.64]but man those Dr. oaker's pizzas I haven't I've not seen it in
[153:35.76]Almost a decade now.
[153:37.22]I remember you used to yap about that all the time.
[153:39.88]If you find it... You couldn't get this guy to shut the fuck up.
[153:43.03]I know, but it was true, though.
[153:45.66]Dr. Oker Pizza.
[153:46.99]I just Googled it.
[153:49.34]There's a guy with a big mustache.
[153:50.22]It exists still.
[153:50.94]You could order it.
[153:52.31]Yeah, it was based on, I forget the lore.
[153:55.11]It's like watching a TV show you saw 10 years ago and try to remember the plot.
[153:58.23]Was it Dr. Oetker invented flour or something, right?
[154:01.64]I invented flour.
[154:02.77]It's a very special proprietary Dr. Oetker's flour.
[154:06.13]Is that completely wrong?
[154:07.08]It's something like that.
[154:09.86]I'm Canadian, so I don't know about that.
[154:13.85]Somebody get the lore.
[154:14.87]Somebody get the lore.
[154:21.61]We had many hippos.
[154:26.68]Tiny hippos on TV.
[154:28.26]How is the Canadian pizza?
[154:29.65]I've always kind of wondered that.
[154:31.88]House hippos.
[154:33.23]It's not bad.
[154:35.33]It's not bad.
[154:36.74]Basic.
[154:38.36]It's like, you know,
[154:40.62]We have like one big pizza chain there.
[154:42.98]And it was like, it's just called Pizza Pizza.
[154:45.77]I don't know if it changed.
[154:47.42]Isn't that just Little Caesars?
[154:49.87]That's like their motto, right?
[154:53.20]Uh, they still, yeah, they got Little Caesars, too.
[154:55.75]Pizza, pizza.
[154:56.23]Pizza, pizza.
[154:57.50]Pizza, pizza.
[154:57.92]Oh, okay.
[154:58.35]Also, yeah.
[154:58.69]Dr. Oetker.
[154:59.15]I was at Pizza.
[154:59.79]Pizza.
[155:00.55]So Dr. Oetker invented baking soda.
[155:04.02]I trust that guy with pizza.
[155:08.87]That's why.
[155:09.29]That's the real lore.
[155:12.53]Maybe this is like his son who's just trying to make money.
[155:14.95]That's true.
[155:16.26]Someone detached the winch.
[155:17.95]You're...
[155:19.35]Industry plant pizza.
[155:20.52]You can do it with the remote.
[155:23.21]Oh, can you?
[155:24.19]Yeah, I get it.
[155:27.55]I mean like an industry plant take would be that Pizza Hut is amazing, but I mean it kind of is.
[155:33.87]Do you guys like Pizza Hut?
[155:35.75]When you're a kid, yes.
[155:37.18]It used to be good.
[155:37.76]I don't think there's one anymore on Staten Island.
[155:40.83]No, I'm telling you.
[155:41.45]Pizza Hut used to be amazing as a kid.
[155:44.34]It used to be...
[155:45.91]But also, Polk, our tastes were different as kids, too.
[155:48.82]No, but it was a restaurant that people went and ate at a restaurant.
[155:52.98]Didn't they have a salad bar at Pizza Hut?
[155:55.94]I'm telling you, they changed it.
[155:57.42]What the fuck's going on over here?
[155:58.55]And no one's thinking about it because they just think it's, oh, I was a kid, so it was probably different.
[156:03.24]No, they actually changed it on us.
[156:05.79]I think we didn't winch it back.
[156:07.54]I like Pizza Hut, but that shit will kill you.
[156:11.70]Stuffed crust pizza.
[156:12.86]You're going to die.
[156:15.73]It used to be so good, bro.
[156:16.85]A stuffed crust.
[156:18.56]Pepperoni stuffed crust.
[156:20.42]I'm...
[156:21.16]You want me to winch you back?
[156:22.57]It looks like you're kind of weird here.
[156:23.96]Pull forward.
[156:25.03]Hold on.
[156:27.49]I don't fuck with stuffed crust.
[156:28.80]I don't see the point.
[156:29.92]Oh, yeah, I don't like that either.
[156:31.36]Oh, that's why I like crust being crust.
[156:33.27]And then like, isn't the whole pizza the pizza itself?
[156:38.31]Where is the winch device?
[156:40.10]Poke, do you have it?
[156:41.56]No.
[156:42.27]It's not on the wall where it belongs.
[156:43.83]That's not good because, yeah, now we don't have a winch device.
[156:46.87]yeah didn't you take it a second ago when you said you were gonna do it and then you didn't I said I was but it wasn't there so yeah
[156:52.43]I had it in my hand, I put it on the floor next to me.
[156:57.07]There were two winch devices at one point, and now we have zero.
[157:02.44]Yeah, my fast food pizza take is I think a pepperoni stuffed crust Pizza Hut pizza I think is like up somewhere around A or S.
[157:11.65]I know that's gross to some of you.
[157:14.37]Look, I found beer.
[157:15.11]Can we just push the car?
[157:16.98]Maybe we should push it.
[157:19.42]That's apparently that's all we can do.
[157:24.41]Well, the winch is going to keep it attached.
[157:26.20]I'm going to keep bothering you guys until you try it.
[157:27.85]Only Vinny is a pizza snob in this chat.
[157:31.92]I've had a cauliflower crust before.
[157:33.23]It's good.
[157:34.82]It's been a while, but it's good.
[157:37.24]Alright.
[157:38.45]I'm sorry.
[157:39.53]It's kind of crunchier because it's a little more dusty, but I kind of like it.
[157:45.32]It's in a good way.
[157:47.63]I'll tell you what, you mentioned the Subway meatballs, right, Jerma?
[157:52.61]I had the Subway personal pie.
[157:55.24]When I was working at Public Access,
[157:59.12]That was a once a week order because it was close, it was cheap, and it was tasty.
[158:06.63]Subway?
[158:07.80]I liked it.
[158:08.96]Even though I had better pizza places nearby, I would get that.
[158:12.24]Where the fuck did the winch go?
[158:15.14]This is bad.
[158:15.88]I drank a beer, this is doing nothing.
[158:18.66]Dude, especially back when it was like the five dollar foot long.
[158:21.23]That was crazy.
[158:22.78]That was amazing.
[158:24.17]You get a huge ass sub.
[158:27.00]Yeah.
[158:27.96]I got us all the way up here and then I asked someone to help for one second and now we're stuck.
[158:33.85]Well, somebody threw the winch into the toilet and flushed it.
[158:39.27]Just keep pushing.
[158:40.25]Just keep like jamming, pushing the back.
[158:42.44]I'm getting it, you getting it?
[158:43.61]I drank beer, I'm pushing your motherfucking ass.
[158:50.53]Am I pushing it weird?
[158:52.36]Let me drink a beer.
[158:52.90]I want frozen pizza now.
[158:56.00]God damn it.
[158:57.82]This is the first time I've had a frozen pizza craving in like three years.
[159:01.45]Do we just drop the wench?
[159:02.58]I'd be totally down for one.
[159:03.97]God damn it.
[159:04.33]Ster, if we get the winch off and you just cut it to the right hard, I think you make it down there.
[159:10.29]The winch shouldn't be affecting it at alright now.
[159:12.70]Yeah, but if we just detach it.
[159:16.46]OK. Yeah, it's stuck on the trees.
[159:20.94]We have to push you like this way.
[159:25.91]Beers make you push much harder.
[159:28.10]Yeah, everybody drank one.
[159:34.08]Bruh.
[159:35.87]Alright, drinking a beer.
[159:41.90]Okay, push.
[159:43.80]Why is he ghosting?
[159:47.31]Oh, hold on.
[159:49.30]Oh, that's why.
[159:52.61]The tree is kind of inside the RV.
[159:56.49]I don't even know if the winch is going to really help, even if we had that.
[160:02.56]It probably would.
[160:03.87]Yeah.
[160:03.95]Well, I mean, there's an option, which is we go back to the last checkpoint and grab the winch device.
[160:12.78]Bring beer and push.
[160:15.22]It's not just on the ground over here somewhere.
[160:18.05]Oh, you know what?
[160:18.66]Chat member brought up a good point.
[160:20.20]Remote is by
[160:22.83]the driver foot organ pedals.
[160:25.80]What?
[160:29.41]Oh, it is.
[160:30.11]It looks like
[160:32.74]You guys good?
[160:33.28]Okay, I have the controller.
[160:35.79]Oh my god.
[160:36.01]Okay.
[160:36.89]Someone go attach to a tree and wench me.
[160:41.02]Wench?
[160:42.40]Yeah.
[160:45.01]I get lost.
[160:47.49]I'm lynching you.
[160:50.30]Alright, push.
[160:52.54]I got lost.
[160:54.13]How did I get this easily lost?
[160:58.88]This is as lost as you would get if you let a gerbil out out here.
[161:01.93]Oh, God.
[161:04.02]I like how that was just, like, on the tip of your tongue.
[161:06.20]That's...
[161:06.98]I unlynched you.
[161:07.57]Just scurrying the fuck away.
[161:09.20]You're detached?
[161:10.28]What the hell am I?
[161:12.68]They reset.
[161:13.79]Jermble.
[161:14.85]Okay, drive straight to me.
[161:17.40]How did I fuck this up so fast?
[161:18.45]Slow down slow, so slow.
[161:20.40]Actually, hold on, hold on.
[161:22.72]You think you can fit through those trees?
[161:26.29]We need to go down to where that block is and drive across that block.
[161:29.10]Oh, wait, you're right.
[161:29.59]Actually, you should just...
[161:31.43]Okay, go straight down here, but slow.
[161:33.50]Oh, it's gonna be really bad.
[161:37.99]As slow as you can.
[161:43.51]Okay, this is bad.
[161:48.68]Can you guys honk the horn?
[161:50.50]Oh my god.
[161:52.03]That's crazy.
[161:52.72]Nice.
[161:53.64]Good save.
[161:54.64]Somehow.
[161:56.69]Okay, Vinny.
[161:57.82]With the confidence in me.
[162:00.11]Alright, cool.
[162:02.78]Okay, is there no gaps?
[162:03.85]Like, can I just ride this?
[162:06.71]Ah!
[162:07.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[162:09.16]This whole thing's an object.
[162:10.83]Oh my god!
[162:15.67]Was that bees?
[162:17.57]I think I heard it.
[162:19.00]Oh, it's a snake.
[162:19.84]There's a snake.
[162:22.93]Oh snake, snake.
[162:24.68]Once in a while I try to do something just like for like two seconds in this game and then I'm back to just like talking about pizza.
[162:32.89]Do we have to winch that backwards, you think?
[162:37.21]I think we need to fill this gap with it, but I can't.
[162:39.82]You can't push it.
[162:40.65]Push it.
[162:40.93]Just push it.
[162:41.49]I don't know what the hell that was.
[162:42.70]We could drink beer or we could use the winch.
[162:44.65]The pushing is working.
[162:45.90]Drink beer.
[162:46.59]Alright, let's do it.
[162:50.69]If we just group F this thing.
[162:55.32]Just push.
[162:57.37]Just gang bang it, right?
[163:00.22]Yeah.
[163:01.73]That's what we're all thinking.
[163:06.49]Excellent.
[163:08.08]Fucking five minutes.
[163:11.19]Please, push this cube.
[163:16.54]Hoodie hole.
[163:18.07]Oh, there it goes.
[163:21.87]Please.
[163:22.27]You guys are fucking disgusting.
[163:26.04]Push this cube.
[163:31.10]It's almost there.
[163:36.96]Oh, no.
[163:39.36]No.
[163:44.44]Fuck.
[163:45.70]Please.
[163:46.57]That was your fucking idea and it was a bad fucking idea.
[163:48.98]You're yelling at somebody.
[163:55.47]Ah, so now what?
[163:56.84]If you keep fucking with me one more fucking time, I swear to- Ah, I can feel my snake!
[164:01.37]I'm- I'm poisoned.
[164:02.29]There's an antidote in one of the cabinets.
[164:04.74]That snake is going to kill me.
[164:05.84]That snake is definitely going to kill me.
[164:09.63]There's an antidote in one of the cabinets.
[164:13.16]And if you have a cabinet, then there is an antidote in the cabinet.
[164:17.84]Oh, let me see.
[164:23.50]Oh my god, are you okay?
[164:27.68]You alright?
[164:29.12]There's a snake under the RV!
[164:32.15]Go snake!
[164:33.34]Snake!
[164:35.89]Is the snake in the car?
[164:37.71]Dude, what if we went up here?
[164:39.00]There's a whole secret path.
[164:41.06]Dude, monkey ass, monkey ass.
[164:42.39]Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.
[164:44.70]Holy shit, why?
[164:45.98]You did it.
[164:46.42]How did that work?
[164:47.82]He's got a massive confidence inflow into his brain here.
[164:50.95]This is not good.
[164:51.70]Vinny, be careful.
[164:53.44]I think we're going down this hill into the mudslide.
[164:55.53]I don't know, though.
[164:57.69]That massive overconfidence adrenaline boost, but we got up here.
[165:00.41]We may have to investigate.
[165:02.17]Yep.
[165:06.38]Can you guys throw me a wood plank so I can get back over?
[165:09.31]I get it.
[165:09.59]No.
[165:11.84]I'll get you a plank.
[165:14.25]Fuck, I need that antidote.
[165:18.18]In the cabinet?
[165:19.58]Where do you see in the cabinet?
[165:22.81]I already drank the antidote.
[165:25.04]No, there's another antidote.
[165:27.75]poke it eat that no actually I just came back
[165:37.06]Hoya!
[165:38.73]Okay, yeah, we're just going down this hill.
[165:41.10]What about that scrap?
[165:43.37]Alright, come over this way.
[165:45.44]Oh, boy!
[165:48.22]Yep, this way.
[165:49.04]A little more and a little more.
[165:53.02]I might have died.
[165:58.71]Might've or did.
[166:00.30]I was trying to be quiet because I did it and I didn't want anyone to think I was an idiot.
[166:10.73]Help me.
[166:12.81]There's a snake on your body.
[166:14.95]My legs look like weird toes with nails.
[166:17.92]I can't get your body.
[166:19.13]I think we're supposed to do this one with the RV.
[166:23.61]No.
[166:27.65]Got the scrap.
[166:30.48]I'm just stuck down here with a snake hissing in my ear.
[166:33.82]Oh, there's an EpiPen right next to me.
[166:36.37]Is there?
[166:37.57]Yeah.
[166:39.02]Um, why are we facing all the way vertical?
[166:43.82]What perspective am I looking at here?
[166:47.63]This is mud, Ster.
[166:49.45]We don't do this, it's mud.
[166:52.36]Oh, no.
[166:54.15]It's mud.
[166:54.65]We don't have the tires for that.
[166:55.60]We need to put the...
[166:56.63]It's mud.
[166:58.25]Yeah.
[166:58.81]Wait.
[166:59.69]Wait a minute.
[167:00.78]He's right.
[167:01.42]It's mud.
[167:01.97]Is there a goat behind you?
[167:03.83]My name is Mud.
[167:05.37]Sir, go behind you in the hole, please, and just save me.
[167:07.66]Someone pulled the wench out.
[167:10.27]Wench solves all.
[167:13.78]Yeah, actually...
[167:15.21]Yeah, what's up?
[167:16.53]In that hole?
[167:18.00]Someone do it.
[167:20.52]Now.
[167:21.47]There's a snake in here.
[167:22.85]Someone work together with me.
[167:24.18]If you just pull the front winch forward.
[167:26.95]What's up, Poke?
[167:27.58]If someone could help.
[167:28.58]I'm good.
[167:29.50]If anyone, three people, one person can just grab it and I can see the max length.
[167:37.18]There's one person.
[167:39.09]I got you, Polk.
[167:42.02]Pull the wench.
[167:43.91]Alright, pull the wench, Polk.
[167:46.49]Where's the wench thingy?
[167:48.71]I just need the wire.
[167:50.19]It's all I need.
[167:51.02]It's one person.
[167:59.89]I don't think that's what we need.
[168:01.26]You want me to get in there and gun it?
[168:03.37]How far can it go?
[168:04.35]I could try.
[168:04.83]I could winch you.
[168:05.39]How far can it go?
[168:06.74]Pushes out when stuck.
[168:08.07]Why don't I just winch you?
[168:09.59]Okay.
[168:11.43]You stand there.
[168:13.71]Oh.
[168:19.31]You should be able to.
[168:23.29]This thing is not in park.
[168:24.55]Thanks everyone for helping.
[168:25.98]You didn't even park the car.
[168:28.61]Idiot.
[168:40.09]Yeah.
[168:40.67]I'm a pretty mean guy.
[168:41.68]Like, don't meet your hero.
[168:42.44]Do you need some wenching?
[168:44.13]No, meet your hero so he can fucking make you hate him and scream in your face.
[168:49.08]Yesterday, I was mean.
[168:51.52]I was mean to chat.
[168:52.76]You just have better heroes.
[168:54.69]I was drinking.
[168:56.54]They were like, Dad, why are you drinking?
[168:58.81]And I was like, because you told me to, chat.
[169:02.32]It's true.
[169:02.94]Do you want me to hit the gas on this or no?
[169:05.07]Yeah.
[169:13.42]Yowch!
[169:14.50]Is there like fake mud?
[169:17.71]What's going on here?
[169:18.78]Real fake mud.
[169:25.89]Oh it's so sticky and gross.
[169:34.58]Uh, I'm kind of, yeah, I'm not going to hit the gas anymore.
[169:43.52]Okay.
[169:45.31]Okay.
[169:46.57]Almost.
[169:47.32]Amaretto?
[169:47.92]Is that what you drink?
[169:49.73]Oh, yeah.
[169:50.25]Someone told you.
[169:50.97]Yeah.
[169:52.01]Have you ever had that?
[169:54.42]I can't quite get outta here.
[169:57.29]I know.
[170:00.09]Do we have another poll?
[170:02.88]Tradition.
[170:03.61]We can't reach these trees.
[170:07.06]I feel like the rat game would save the vibes.
[170:10.37]They're not rancid yet.
[170:13.06]The vibes have been an A-plus for me the whole time.
[170:17.26]Yeah, they're immaculate.
[170:18.58]Someone please save the vibes.
[170:22.69]Please?
[170:25.34]In fact, I may have been on a vibe overdose earlier and had to calm down.
[170:28.91]I had a lot of fun.
[170:30.24]Almost too much fun.
[170:31.25]Oh, that was when you went to go piss.
[170:33.01]When I screamed earlier, the scream was the polar.
[170:36.85]I cried laughing.
[170:38.45]That was too funny.
[170:39.66]I'm I don't have the polar.
[170:42.35]I mean, I'm still attached to this short one over here.
[170:54.85]Second gear.
[170:59.87]Third gear.
[171:02.84]No.
[171:04.09]First gear.
[171:06.06]Neutral.
[171:07.96]First gear.
[171:12.50]Alright, how we doing?
[171:15.59]Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster.
[171:17.00]I just look over.
[171:19.55]It's just vibrating violently.
[171:21.45]you good oh my god are you good I have the question I mean I think should I keep going if I should are you attached to him I detached
[171:31.86]The problem is we don't have another pole.
[171:33.86]We don't?
[171:36.53]Here, here, here.
[171:37.31]I have a plan.
[171:38.74]I have a plan.
[171:39.42]Let me drive.
[171:41.26]Let me scout ahead a little bit and see if there's another pole somewhere or a winch.
[171:50.86]I think the back tire can't move because it's on the mud.
[171:56.66]What are you laughing at?
[171:57.99]Yo, you good?
[172:02.54]stop earlier.
[172:03.61]Oh, that was amazing.
[172:05.47]That was so good.
[172:14.52]Yeah, what is ahead?
[172:15.35]Vinny, did you say you were looking ahead?
[172:17.35]I'm looking, there's bear spray and two scrap metal and burger and that's like pretty much it.
[172:23.07]There's no winches.
[172:25.03]There's nothing that can help us on our journey.
[172:27.24]I think I see one.
[172:30.89]Just be able to ride the wall here.
[172:34.36]Do we have oil for the car?
[172:35.53]I hear gas.
[172:38.60]I think we're wasting gas.
[172:39.90]Because we...
[172:41.15]It's looking like we need it.
[172:49.40]Gaius.
[172:53.69]Need some Gaius in it.
[172:57.77]Oh, you need some Gaius.
[173:00.60]Gasp.
[173:01.82]A gasp for further room.
[173:08.77]Is the car in VR park or iron?
[173:12.67]Looks like it has one.
[173:14.01]I did see that clip a long time ago.
[173:15.66]It's fine.
[173:16.34]Okay.
[173:16.90]Yeah.
[173:18.61]Yeah, that was my first exposure to that bit and I didn't know what was happening.
[173:21.98]I was very confused.
[173:24.41]I felt I was in real danger.
[173:28.46]Oh shit, you guys didn't complete Parkour Island, did you?
[173:34.20]Heh.
[173:34.64]Is there more up there?
[173:36.03]There is a winch up there.
[173:37.88]Oh my god.
[173:38.66]There's a pole.
[173:40.17]Get that shit and bring it over.
[173:42.70]I don't... You stand the smelly smells.
[173:44.75]I threw the wood.
[173:49.61]You wouldn't touch them when you were a child.
[173:56.23]That was a fun time.
[173:59.83]What was that originally for?
[174:02.72]I was playing House Slipper 1.
[174:08.71]I think I need help.
[174:10.56]I made a saw house.
[174:11.95]I either need help or I need to stop trying.
[174:17.52]Where are you at, Ster?
[174:19.11]I'll help you.
[174:22.08]I'll parkour.
[174:24.61]Can you push the car?
[174:26.60]Someone else?
[174:27.51]Gulpster, gulpster.
[174:34.48]That was such a funny noise.
[174:38.07]Alright, I'm pushing the car.
[174:42.29]I'm dead.
[174:44.99]And it's weird because you said you were going to come help, and now you're saying you're pushing the car.
[174:48.61]Okay, from...
[174:49.56]I want it timed.
[174:50.26]You got distracted in those two seconds from when you said it.
[174:52.97]Exactly.
[174:53.86]So you died in two seconds after I was, I'm coming to help you.
[174:57.07]Okay.
[174:57.97]Okay.
[174:58.38]So how am I supposed to help you?
[174:59.70]Not include help.
[175:00.99]But where are you?
[175:02.68]I fell in the hole.
[175:03.90]You fell in with the snake ones.
[175:06.03]Yeah.
[175:07.22]Oh, where I died last time?
[175:08.59]Where Pogue died?
[175:10.71]Is there a spider there?
[175:12.26]A snake?
[175:15.01]I can see what everyone's doing and no person is doing anything.
[175:18.49]Look at my screen.
[175:19.11]Look at my screen.
[175:19.99]I'm doing a lot of tech right now.
[175:23.50]Look at my screen.
[175:26.25]And look who came to save your ass.
[175:31.10]Where are you?
[175:34.23]Oh, there you are.
[175:36.29]There.
[175:37.97]Don't act like I didn't save you.
[175:39.52]Is this why I can't drive?
[175:41.57]No, this is me trying to help you drive.
[175:44.12]Oh, okay.
[175:46.87]He can't do it.
[175:48.54]You need the pet.
[175:49.75]What the fuck was that?
[175:52.32]He stinks.
[175:53.06]He stinks.
[175:53.46]Are you dead?
[175:56.00]Yes.
[175:57.27]Oh.
[176:01.13]Uh.
[176:02.50]The plank launched me into the wall.
[176:07.34]So hard I died hitting the wall.
[176:09.41]Well, let's see if you...
[176:10.67]I'll parkour for you, okay?
[176:12.12]Here we go.
[176:12.66]Oh, look at me.
[176:13.34]I'm Stern.
[176:13.99]I'm going to be jumping around.
[176:14.91]Why didn't you...
[176:15.49]Hey, everybody, why don't you come to me?
[176:17.65]I said to come to me.
[176:18.72]Look at me parkour.
[176:19.75]Watch.
[176:25.85]It's hard to do that when you can't see.
[176:30.15]There's a revive down there.
[176:31.27]I think I saw like under my body.
[176:33.36]There's also a snake in here.
[176:35.27]Yeah, but then you could revive me.
[176:37.84]Is it under back wheel?
[176:39.43]And I get bit by a fucking- I knew the snake was there!
[176:42.20]We don't have a flip tool anymore.
[176:43.44]Yeah, but under our body there's a revive.
[176:47.76]All you have to do is not die.
[176:49.69]The snake that's coiled around your body.
[176:53.34]I guess this is the end.
[176:54.31]No, it's not.
[176:56.20]They're going to get this out of here.
[176:57.90]There's a garage right down there.
[176:59.21]They can go revive us at the garage.
[177:02.02]Are you both dead?
[177:02.54]Not all the garages have revives, yeah.
[177:04.82]He guilt tripped me into coming to save him.
[177:07.35]You have little ramps.
[177:08.35]Maybe those might help.
[177:10.18]There's another.
[177:11.49]Guys, there's another winch pole.
[177:15.42]on the island.
[177:17.72]I love how it's just out of reach.
[177:19.31]That's how you died, right?
[177:20.91]Trying to get that.
[177:22.02]Yeah.
[177:22.76]Dude, Ster.
[177:23.24]Watch out.
[177:23.82]There's a Minecraft spider in here.
[177:26.91]Whoa.
[177:27.51]It must be behind this block.
[177:28.89]I'm so scared.
[177:40.09]You guys are kind of doing it.
[177:42.74]Try now.
[177:59.32]I think Ster muted you.
[178:00.87]That's fine.
[178:01.25]He can hear me in his head.
[178:03.00]I'm gonna get it.
[178:03.64]He'll never be able to mute me for real.
[178:05.93]He'll always hear me in his head.
[178:09.23]Hello?
[178:11.48]The hell was that?
[178:13.79]Who was that so far back?
[178:22.17]I'm going to revive you guys, and we can figure out what we're going to do from there.
[178:25.28]But if we can get to that next checkpoint, that would be a great place to...
[178:29.46]figure out.
[178:30.25]Yeah, folk, you just need to do the wood up there.
[178:34.17]I tried to do the wood and it killed me.
[178:40.47]Ugh.
[178:42.76]This is a good time.
[178:43.93]I'm having a great time.
[178:45.01]You could stand on the top of the RV.
[178:47.70]Yeah, there's no graves here.
[178:49.09]Oh, wait.
[178:49.35]No, there's two.
[178:49.85]There's one.
[178:50.39]There's one.
[178:52.28]Oh, there you go.
[178:53.35]You guys are back.
[178:54.53]Nice.
[178:56.16]Now we can try platforming again to get that winch.
[178:59.02]Scrap metal.
[179:00.50]Burgers.
[179:03.00]Coffee.
[179:06.72]There's a winch controller in here too.
[179:10.48]Yeah, but we need a pole.
[179:12.97]Yeah, is there one up here?
[179:13.93]You said there's definitely one up here?
[179:16.00]I'm fairly sure.
[179:21.36]Like, I could be wrong, but I've never been wrong before, you know what I mean?
[179:25.64]Mm-hmm.
[179:26.06]Yeah.
[179:27.27]Name one time, Vinny.
[179:29.20]I didn't say you were.
[179:30.52]Oh, Jerma, come over here.
[179:34.14]What?
[179:37.42]What are we doing?
[179:39.87]I'm gonna pass you.
[179:41.24]Looks like there's scrap metal.
[179:49.27]Okay, wait, where am I going?
[179:52.16]You're going to that island.
[179:53.33]I'm going to make it that island?
[179:55.50]Yeah, shut up.
[179:56.27]You're doing it.
[180:01.31]Did you live?
[180:02.18]I lived.
[180:03.05]He took 20% of my health by doing that.
[180:05.65]There's a lot of cool things here.
[180:08.20]Wait, are you really alive over there?
[180:09.99]I'm alive over here and I'm picking up all kinds of shit.
[180:12.56]There's like a ton of scrap.
[180:13.41]There's a pole up there and throw it down here.
[180:15.61]Yeah, hold on.
[180:16.21]Is there a pole?
[180:17.19]I got a winch right here.
[180:18.92]Bingo.
[180:19.34]Oh, man.
[180:20.76]Alright, who wants it?
[180:23.49]Wait, wrong side.
[180:27.13]Alright, here we go.
[180:28.98]I'm gonna throw it down.
[180:31.11]It.
[180:32.17]I don't want to throw it in the mud.
[180:33.46]What if it screws up?
[180:35.13]Yeah, put it back there.
[180:37.12]Oh shit.
[180:38.82]Alright, I'll throw the other stuff down here too.
[180:43.82]We can repair the car.
[180:45.07]There's a ton of scrap I just got.
[180:47.36]Someone grab the front winch on the truck.
[180:50.45]and and then and then and then and then bring it to me there's another winch pole
[180:57.36]Someone bring the wrench and then I'm going to put the pole in the ground and then we're going to beat this.
[181:03.84]A winch pole coming down behind the RV right now.
[181:06.27]I can't go further.
[181:07.19]Okay, we go right this side because there's no mud on the side.
[181:10.53]We're not.
[181:11.83]I think he just like, he loves that.
[181:13.96]Okay.
[181:16.21]The joy in his voice in that first 40 minutes.
[181:18.18]I think people listen more.
[181:19.46]He wants to regress the baby.
[181:21.71]If I was saying that, I don't think anyone would have come that quick.
[181:26.28]I was coming before.
[181:29.61]Alright, wench me.
[181:30.60]I think that's everything up here.
[181:34.77]Wench me.
[181:37.11]You've got to wench me.
[181:43.41]Wow.
[181:46.18]It really is like a cheat code.
[181:47.96]Yippee.
[181:48.50]We did it, everyone.
[181:49.99]We did it.
[181:50.83]Not fully.
[181:51.84]Not yet.
[181:52.46]Not quite.
[181:52.94]Could be stuck here.
[181:54.82]Can we get the thing in the front?
[181:56.40]We did it everyone.
[181:57.60]There's another winch pole that I threw down.
[181:58.95]Did you guys get it?
[182:00.09]Everybody, we doing it.
[182:02.88]Get that other winch pole that I threw?
[182:04.89]Yeah, I have that.
[182:07.25]Sick.
[182:08.60]You do a great job, everyone.
[182:15.82]I don't know if that's a little kid or old lady.
[182:17.93]It's hard to tell.
[182:22.22]Uh, this wench.
[182:24.37]What's up with the, what's up with the, what's up?
[182:29.38]I don't know.
[182:29.98]No one was driving.
[182:30.66]You don't need to connect.
[182:31.64]You can disconnect.
[182:34.07]Oh, fuck.
[182:35.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[182:38.96]I didn't disconnect it.
[182:39.84]I dropped it.
[182:41.09]It's still...
[182:43.02]Okay.
[182:43.14]It's fine.
[182:43.80]It's fine.
[182:44.18]It's fine.
[182:44.49]It's fine.
[182:44.77]We made it.
[182:45.15]We made it.
[182:47.06]Checkpoint connected to...
[182:48.70]I don't know nothing.
[182:52.43]You can just click reset on the front of the car.
[182:54.10]I got it.
[182:57.51]Wait, that wasn't even the one that I put down.
[182:59.27]Alright, where did that other winch go?
[183:02.75]Guys, was there another winch that dropped out of the car as I was driving?
[183:08.47]That and the Jack.
[183:11.78]We got a lot of repairs we need to do though.
[183:13.77]Holy shit.
[183:20.27]in the shadow um does the do we need to use the scrap metal do we get a free repair with the little thing down there
[183:33.06]I really don't understand what this does.
[183:36.06]I've never seen it do anything.
[183:39.98]The welder is the blue damage.
[183:42.61]Okay.
[183:43.07]Thank you.
[183:43.70]I'm going to assume something looks like a penis.
[183:46.93]Yeah.
[183:48.08]Come get your... Do you see your shadow down here?
[183:50.07]Do you see your own shadow?
[183:53.65]Did I press X?
[183:58.26]With the rock.
[184:00.44]You might not have the lumen.
[184:01.23]Do you have the lumen lighting on?
[184:03.34]No, should I?
[184:03.92]Yeah.
[184:05.99]I'll throw lumen.
[184:10.44]It's not that funny anymore, honestly.
[184:13.19]Oh, okay.
[184:16.39]Okay, we at least have a bumper now.
[184:19.21]Even with the lumen, it's not doing anything particularly.
[184:23.20]Let's go through your settings.
[184:28.68]Any more scrap lying around?
[184:34.78]I'm gonna look at the map too.
[184:37.14]Have we figured out what the drill does?
[184:38.70]It's been like four in-game hours.
[184:40.19]Do we know what it even does?
[184:41.20]We haven't lost a tire.
[184:43.25]Oh, because I've been repairing.
[184:45.91]Oh, you're so good.
[184:47.34]Just saying.
[184:50.71]Anybody want a burger?
[184:52.78]I might need a res.
[184:54.94]Oh my god.
[184:55.86]Oh my god, fuck.
[185:03.51]It's my burger.
[185:10.09]Hey, yours fell out of the ground.
[185:12.69]Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[185:22.85]So we did it.
[185:23.72]That's the final one.
[185:25.41]We did it?
[185:26.89]Yeah.
[185:27.52]Poke, Vinny, what's your health at?
[185:30.53]Like in real life?
[185:31.82]Well, I got a little bit of a knee thing going on lately.
[185:34.68]In the fake life.
[185:36.59]Lower left.
[185:38.19]Yeah, I'm probably at 20% health.
[185:42.46]Is a burger on the ground?
[185:44.23]I suggest whoever needs it eats it.
[185:46.66]I could use a ground burger.
[185:48.80]Ow.
[185:55.06]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[185:57.59]Hold on.
[185:59.01]I think we could do this whole thing backwards.
[186:01.33]Um, I'm trying to cook here.
[186:11.79]Where's that burger?
[186:12.47]Is it still real?
[186:13.58]It's cooking on the ground now.
[186:17.07]There will be two.
[186:22.99]If you need a second one, it just...
[186:24.24]I don't know where it went.
[186:24.88]It rolled under the seat.
[186:26.89]Don't... We need these.
[186:27.79]Don't throw those out.
[186:29.27]What are you throwing these out for?
[186:30.30]This is health.
[186:30.88]This is a health potion.
[186:33.37]it rolled someone put a burger under the seat I need to get onto the we're keeping it there
[186:40.29]Oh, the winch pole is here.
[186:41.55]We got the winch pole.
[186:43.64]Roof is unaccessible, I think, because...
[186:47.63]Untenable.
[186:49.00]Can you throw me up there?
[186:49.94]I see the map.
[186:52.84]Yeah, I need a res.
[186:54.81]You guys at the grave?
[186:56.28]I got you.
[186:57.45]Thank you.
[186:58.96]Oh, you can put those in cabinets.
[187:00.48]Oh, my God.
[187:01.75]This whole fucking time.
[187:02.98]Alright.
[187:03.78]Let me put this...
[187:04.44]Does this go in a cabinet?
[187:05.85]No, the winch pole doesn't, so I'm going to need someone to toss me.
[187:08.56]I need you to toss me.
[187:10.46]please um I gotta say we've made kind of unbelievable progress
[187:18.55]for how fucked some of this run was looking, yes, absolutely.
[187:21.94]You show me?
[187:23.21]Yeah, we're, we're, take a look.
[187:25.38]We've kind of made insane progress.
[187:29.24]Am I higher?
[187:32.90]Oh, wow.
[187:34.45]I want to see the map.
[187:39.76]Where am I going?
[187:42.81]Here, the map is on the ground.
[187:43.98]You're gonna break my leg.
[187:44.94]You actually caught me.
[187:55.00]I feel like we're at the end game here.
[187:56.48]I think this next turn is maybe one or two quadrants.
[188:03.42]What are you going to do?
[188:06.59]How's it look?
[188:07.25]Oh, wow, we did make insane progress.
[188:10.41]No!
[188:11.47]Wait, there's a cave in there.
[188:12.96]We're not done yet.
[188:15.68]What a real piece of shit.
[188:18.02]I'm assuming, oh my god, it looks like there's so much more.
[188:19.89]Wait, pause.
[188:20.19]Sir, wait.
[188:20.85]Sir, wait.
[188:23.33]No, I want to go now.
[188:27.47]Somebody put an endgame spoiler in the chat.
[188:29.40]Bro, I just fucking started watching that.
[188:32.19]And I got to the point right before they are about to confront Thanos.
[188:36.25]And I had to pause it because... Well, after this tunnel, we have to do maps.
[188:42.68]Dude, did you guys watch Pluribus?
[188:45.88]I'm watching Plurb.
[188:47.87]How you feeling about it?
[188:49.30]I like it.
[188:50.02]It's an interesting premise.
[188:51.10]It's a slow burn.
[188:53.25]I think we just go.
[188:55.56]Yeah.
[188:56.36]It's a good show to fall asleep to and then come back at it next day.
[189:00.20]Yeah, I agree with that.
[189:01.23]But I'm liking it.
[189:02.56]I mean, hey, it's...
[189:04.17]Better call Saul and Breaking Bad Vince Gilligan.
[189:08.10]I've never heard of this.
[189:08.99]What is it?
[189:09.55]We got a music track.
[189:12.00]You might like it.
[189:12.60]It's interesting.
[189:16.06]not drive into the cave yet and no spoilers or anything just uh well everyone was here what the I'm not in the vehicle dude everyone is here we were just talking about Marvel
[189:25.97]I feel like the main character is a Ster.
[189:27.49]Am I right?
[189:28.62]What is this show on?
[189:31.65]Is it on the Apple?
[189:33.25]It's on wherever you want it to be.

[189:51.73]Dude, what the hell is going on?
[189:52.82]This place is on fire.

[190:08.29]And I really enjoy playing with games with you guys.
[190:10.16]I'm just talking about shit.
[190:12.27]Sounded ominous, but you sound genuine.
[190:15.77]I'm probably gonna die soon in the show, but just letting you know I love you guys, man.
[190:19.64]In the show?
[190:20.22]In the show.
[190:22.61]We're in a show?
[190:23.36]What is this?
[190:25.72]What season are we on?
[190:28.03]Well, that means we got canceled real quick.
[190:30.77]Once in a while, someone will tell me they like my show.
[190:34.36]Like at conventions or like... Yeah, in some... Vinny, I like your show.
[190:39.93]Fire extinguishers.
[190:43.34]I guess it could be classified as a show a lot of times.
[190:47.98]My Sunday streams are kind of more like a show than...
[190:50.61]Your streams make no sense to me.
[190:53.28]Which one?
[190:54.40]The way you go live.
[190:56.69]Like, you're so, like, good at streaming, but you go anytime, and it's so, like, it's scheduled.
[191:03.15]It's like scheduled content but random.
[191:05.51]It's so good.
[191:06.78]I love that.
[191:09.45]uh excuse me folk I mean in the best way possible um it is sometimes on a schedule and sometimes you'll be like holy she's live again you're doing like two segments in the streams like what the
[191:19.44]You planned this?
[191:20.74]Nominated for Best Variety Streamer.
[191:23.01]Best Variety Streamer nominee.
[191:24.42]I think there's a reason for that, Vinny.
[191:26.79]Well, you're a legend.
[191:28.21]I'm telling you, you're a goddamn legend.
[191:32.02]Ster, we'll talk later.
[191:32.92]I gotta go, guys.
[191:39.52]Hey, Polk, do you want some whipped cream?
[191:41.43]Yes!
[191:41.97]Yeah, let's go!
[191:43.03]I hope I didn't just fuck up the RV.
[191:55.53]I feel fat.
[191:56.56]What is this?
[192:01.64]Can you move?
[192:03.53]Okay, cool.
[192:08.09]So we have...

[192:10.78]I love you guys so much.
[192:14.23]You guys are great.
[192:15.78]What?
[192:16.75]Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[192:18.74]This doesn't sound real.
[192:19.97]It's real.
[192:21.30]Alright, sweet.
[192:22.70]Okay.
[192:23.18]Why wouldn't it be real?
[192:24.07]This is scary.
[192:24.97]We have to go fast kind of over this.
[192:27.12]I'm kind of afraid because there's a gap.
[192:29.11]Oh my goodness.
[192:31.04]Celebratory whipped cream for the driver.
[192:34.71]Celebratory whipped cream.
[192:35.52]I love you guys so much.
[192:40.74]How are you doing?
[192:44.20]Do you love us?
[192:47.76]Warning, warning, what's ahead?
[192:49.61]Warning, there's a warning.
[192:51.72]That's a big word.
[192:52.82]One of my minions, check it out.
[192:55.11]Yes, sir!
[192:57.46]Reporting for duty!
[192:58.97]Sir!
[193:00.90]There is a rock!
[193:03.69]Rock in the road!
[193:05.12]I mean, like, is it safe to drive over this shit?
[193:07.27]It is not safe without a plank, sir!
[193:10.37]But isn't there planks already laid down?
[193:11.90]There are!
[193:13.98]We should just go over, not around.
[193:17.36]That's nonsense to go around.
[193:18.97]Nonsense!
[193:21.56]Yeah, you put...
[193:22.24]I agree with Ster.
[193:24.11]I say we put the wood to the right and just dig it.
[193:26.51]We can do it.
[193:27.13]Oh, goodness.
[193:27.65]Yeah, let's dick this shit.
[193:28.98]Let's dick this thing up.
[193:30.04]You guys want to dick this?
[193:31.75]Yeah, we'll get down and dick it up.
[193:33.68]Strain that wood up into the air.
[193:37.55]Yeah, short for vindicative.
[193:39.89]What are you talking about?
[193:42.20]Which way?
[193:43.58]Where do you want to go?
[193:44.21]Straight forward.
[193:45.23]You want to go up like this?
[193:46.31]Straight like this?
[193:47.76]Oh, I dropped it on myself!
[193:50.15]That cabin looks like it's burnt to a crisp.
[193:54.03]Is this what you want to do?
[193:54.79]Okay.
[194:00.10]Going crazy for no reason.
[194:01.97]Poke, Poke, can you talk to him?
[194:03.70]He does not listen to me.
[194:05.49]He listens to you.
[194:07.68]Thank you, Poke.
[194:08.86]Oh, and look at that.
[194:10.33]He'll receive it better.
[194:11.48]Is that perfect placement or should I get my glasses checked?
[194:17.72]The left tire?
[194:18.80]The left one's a little bit too weird.
[194:26.82]There's no way that the fire is a weird rock.
[194:29.49]Something about it.
[194:30.38]I learned something about the fire.
[194:31.91]What happened?
[194:32.91]It hurts you.
[194:39.57]Thanks for getting out and doing it, Poke.
[194:42.52]You're a real one.
[194:44.83]How about that?
[194:46.35]I don't know, let me just get lined up.
[194:47.72]Just do the Metal Gear Solid, like...
[194:52.77]Oh, hey, what's up, Stuart?
[194:54.01]Oh, yeah.
[194:57.57]Turn left, please.
[194:58.78]Turn left, please.
[195:00.28]Can you put the woods back on?
[195:05.70]And then get in the car, because I don't want to hear any little whippersnappers saying, well, you left without me.
[195:10.36]I'll go straight ahead.
[195:10.96]I'll go straight and tell you.
[195:11.89]Oh, yeah.
[195:12.63]A little fall.
[195:13.46]It's a little bump.
[195:14.50]There's a little bump in front of you.
[195:19.03]Careful.
[195:21.85]Alright, all the way down.
[195:23.13]Dude, that's crazy.
[195:27.93]I'm going to puke.
[195:29.41]I'm going to get in the car for this.
[195:30.26]We're fine.
[195:32.51]You gotta punch it through up there.
[195:34.23]Well, not here, but up there.
[195:40.46]Switch to two.
[195:41.00]Switch to two, probably.
[195:41.66]Oh, fuck.
[195:42.63]Never mind.
[195:43.09]Gotta get that better gear.
[195:44.98]I did.
[195:45.32]I just probably did it too late.
[195:47.26]First gear.
[195:47.85]I'm in trouble.
[195:48.71]I'm falling back.
[195:49.19]Low and slow.
[195:49.49]Low and slow.
[195:50.20]Winch.
[195:56.22]I think this is a good time to just reverse it.
[195:59.38]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[196:01.21]Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[196:03.02]I just wanted to kill you both.
[196:04.59]No, no, no.
[196:04.93]I have the winches.
[196:05.79]The winch, the winch, the winch.
[196:06.76]Stop, stop.
[196:07.36]I'm not kidding.
[196:07.76]I'm being dead serious.
[196:09.05]I'm being dead serious.
[196:09.73]Please don't stop moving.
[196:12.67]Don't stop moving.
[196:13.64]Okay, I'm going.
[196:15.09]Oh, and oh, that's it.
[196:19.27]Wait, wait.
[196:19.83]Good job, guys.
[196:20.79]Well, that's it, isn't it?
[196:25.61]Dickhead.
[196:26.09]Well, I don't even think we have to repair this little buster.
[196:30.05]That was kind of a flawless execution.
[196:33.71]It still needs a repair or two.
[196:35.90]Can't say that's it and then do nothing.
[196:38.21]I'm also stuck here.
[196:40.42]Can someone save me?
[196:42.83]Where are you?
[196:44.72]Thank you.
[196:45.17]Vinny, I think you need lotion.
[196:47.08]That's a fucking weird chat member.
[196:48.43]Why?
[196:48.71]No, why?
[196:50.74]I have second degree burns.
[196:53.61]Does anyone have any lotion?
[196:56.09]He's all on me earlier.
[196:58.02]God damn it.
[197:00.31]The out-of-context shit from the stream, I swear to God.
[197:03.99]Wait, do we have three hammers?
[197:05.97]We don't need this many hammers.
[197:07.48]Oh, yeah, the burn is burn.
[197:09.33]No, we don't need three hammers.
[197:11.89]Burn is like a jumpscare, kind of, out of nowhere.
[197:17.27]Watch out, watch out behind.
[197:18.09]Checking the roof.
[197:19.12]There's no lotion on the roof.
[197:20.88]Behind Chef?
[197:22.01]Hmm?
[197:22.97]Burgers.
[197:23.63]Where?
[197:24.24]Is this map always random?
[197:25.42]Is it procedural?
[197:25.98]Yes, Chef.
[197:27.56]Chef, you have a huge drop, chef.
[197:29.17]We're not done in there.
[197:30.80]Ster, Ster.
[197:31.35]We're not done in there.
[197:31.97]Stop reversing, chef.
[197:36.31]We didn't get the health from the welding machine.
[197:41.20]Oh no!
[197:43.33]We never had to replace our tires, right?
[197:46.32]We're so good.
[197:47.02]Pretty good gamers, I think.
[197:48.38]Tires are in good shape.
[197:50.51]Generally.
[197:51.24]We should replace a couple.
[197:52.45]Which direction am I driving out of here?
[197:54.52]Gotta look at the map.
[197:58.66]Can we get the, um, what do they call it on the top of the boat where the, you know, pirates up at the top of the spyglass?
[198:04.04]Can we get one of those going?
[198:05.12]Mast?
[198:06.63]No.
[198:08.44]Crow's nest.
[198:09.66]Yes.
[198:12.65]No, but we're all getting to the age where we're going to have crow's feet.
[198:18.14]our asses um alright I think you need to reverse the car and then turn left
[198:25.65]Poke, you're a fucking real one.
[198:28.32]No one else gets it.
[198:29.76]I told you to stop reversing.
[198:30.93]I wanna see the map.
[198:38.62]They need a grill.
[198:40.57]Should we bring the grill?
[198:42.72]Actually, probably.
[198:43.67]I think we have a grill.
[198:45.73]We used one of them.
[198:48.09]Okay, we've got... What the hell is up here?
[198:50.83]How are we going to navigate this?
[198:52.10]I don't know.
[198:53.43]No idea what's up here.
[199:00.41]Oh, this is, this is cooked.
[199:03.08]It's looking a little spooky over here.
[199:06.48]Is that a monster?
[199:07.43]Did anyone bring bear spray?
[199:09.08]No.
[199:09.65]Watch out, Poke.
[199:10.41]He's gonna fuck us.
[199:12.61]Up.
[199:12.91]I don't wanna get hit by this bear.
[199:15.45]Oh, boy.
[199:17.98]You just kind of went with it, huh?
[199:19.84]Yeah, I'm a monster truck.
[199:22.80]The bear can't cross the bridge.
[199:24.06]You can take your time now.
[199:26.92]You're doing good.
[199:28.06]Good shit.
[199:29.09]My time is double time.
[199:30.90]That's my tempo.
[199:33.12]This is going to be crazy.
[199:35.37]Burger pack in the bathroom.
[199:37.50]one false move here and it's all over Ster.
[199:40.49]That's a rock on your right tire.
[199:42.34]Cut it a little more to the left or maybe even reverse a little.
[199:44.73]I'm not quite sure.
[199:46.17]I can't see.
[199:47.46]You're on the rock right now.
[199:49.07]I would say reverse Gun it
[199:57.43]Okay.
[200:04.84]You got it, bro, I believe.
[200:12.94]Dude, just threading this needle.
[200:15.68]Uh-oh.
[200:16.02]They don't understand.
[200:21.09]that's so true oh this thing is tipping it's tipping you see my hands yeah
[200:28.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[200:30.65]We might want to winch it.
[200:32.50]Where do we go here?
[200:35.51]He's crashing out right now.
[200:37.02]No, he just has the driver's instinct.
[200:44.01]He's crashing out right now.
[200:45.49]Dude, we're winning right now.
[200:47.62]Am I gonna hit this tree if I turn?
[200:49.05]Left.
[200:49.37]Dude, we're winching right now.
[200:51.82]Uh, this tree might be in your way, but no, you're good.
[200:54.29]You gotta keep going.
[200:55.55]Got it.
[200:55.85]Wait, wait, this might be a big ramp.
[200:57.48]Hold on, let me check.
[200:59.10]Oh no, you're good.
[200:59.89]Uh, hold on.
[201:00.63]Ster, your left side is a little... Yeah, there you go.
[201:06.11]I think we're good to get in the car.
[201:07.26]Hold on.
[201:08.36]Yeah, let's get in.
[201:13.22]It sounded like the... Baby.
[201:18.64]You know that I want you.
[201:20.57]Oh.
[201:25.69]I heard that song recently.
[201:27.26]What is it?
[201:27.78]I don't know it.
[201:28.53]Where are we going here?
[201:30.10]To...
[201:31.83]Pop song?
[201:32.47]Recent?
[201:32.87]Old?
[201:33.12]Baby, you know that I want you.
[201:35.91]Kiss me through the phone.
[201:37.52]Kiss me.
[201:39.34]I don't know what's happening.
[201:40.84]Is that like the birthday song?
[201:42.21]I thought it was Baby Shark.
[201:46.92]Do do do do do do.
[201:48.74]I can play the first second.
[201:53.33]The first one second of the song.

[201:59.49]Oh yeah, I know that one.
[202:00.42]Yep.
[202:05.52]That's Soldier Boy.
[202:08.43]Yeah, soldier.
[202:09.86]Soldier boy.
[202:11.99]You're good just to keep going, I think.
[202:14.15]Yeah, I know.
[202:16.03]The map is a little messy.
[202:17.19]It doesn't really show anything.
[202:18.92]Oh, the song.
[202:20.06]No, I know Soldier Boy from selling bootleg game consoles that he doesn't have the rights to.
[202:24.87]That's my, like, my primary information on him.
[202:28.14]Game is game.
[202:29.10]I respect that.
[202:34.62]We're just cruising right now.
[202:35.97]This is a total cruise.
[202:37.47]This is great.
[202:47.67]Yeah, right.
[202:48.67]There's locked in.

[203:18.68]I wasn't doing I wasn't doing shit.
[203:20.79]It's just they had extra people out for Thanksgiving.
[203:24.75]That's another checkpoint already.
[203:26.95]Holy shit, we're doing good.
[203:28.28]This is pretty great.
[203:30.13]We know you're not like that, sir.
[203:31.45]We know you don't put other lives on the line.
[203:34.71]Just yourself.
[203:36.64]True.
[203:37.42]Antidote.
[203:39.15]There are flares now.
[203:40.29]Who needs lotion?
[203:42.40]Oh man, I need lotion.
[203:43.60]It's right here.
[203:44.25]There's flares.
[203:51.91]There's more motion.
[203:53.41]Are you good?

[203:55.96]That was a genuine you good as well.
[203:57.39]I was curious because you were holding the horn down.
[203:59.99]I'm just got nothing else to do.
[204:01.52]I'm just driving.
[204:02.68]Oh, the flare guy.
[204:05.19]The flare guy, you should follow him.
[204:06.45]Somebody fucking Ubered a PS5.
[204:11.48]I haven't played that since.
[204:15.03]Like anything on the PS5?
[204:16.37]Your PS5 at all?
[204:18.68]Like one hour of Death Stranding since we talked about it.
[204:20.91]Oh my god.
[204:23.38]Yeah, that's a common tale.
[204:25.31]I've heard a very similar tale, and yet it is a very high-selling console.
[204:29.79]There's not much else on there.
[204:31.95]well my friend though someone got me one and I just like I don't know what else to play on it astrobot
[204:38.79]Asshole Bot?
[204:40.30]Yes, that one.
[204:41.53]Very funny.
[204:43.58]Listen to the song.
[204:45.20]Very funny young man.
[204:46.11]He says, I am Asshole Bot over and over again.
[204:48.72]Okay, are we leaving?
[204:51.82]Yeah, come.

[204:58.07]I, you, you need to wait.
[205:00.70]Wait.
[205:01.92]You should go at this with speed.
[205:03.69]Go back and go fast.
[205:04.66]I was trying to get the supplies.
[205:07.97]I need some supplies.
[205:09.40]Close that door.
[205:11.98]Where's Jeremiah?
[205:14.29]Not too fast.

[205:16.37]Wait!
[205:17.10]Don't go!
[205:17.68]Listen, when you land, you want to take a little bit of a left, okay?
[205:22.53]So once you get up, go fast and take a left.
[205:25.72]It looks like a right.
[205:26.47]Actually a right.
[205:27.25]A right.
[205:27.93]Sorry.
[205:29.02]A right.

[205:35.22]Wait.
[205:35.35]Wait, wait, wait.

[205:49.39]Do these pants look good?
[205:50.31]Maybe I'm gonna change these socks.
[205:52.72]Do you want to drink nugget juice with me?
[205:54.32]If not, then go.
[205:55.87]Alright, hang on.
[205:56.35]Give me a minute.
[205:56.79]I'll be right there.
[205:57.62]You're going to wring those nuggets out over my head.
[206:00.13]This is molten core.
[206:01.37]Look.
[206:01.83]Is everybody attuned?
[206:04.76]Oh, get in there.
[206:06.10]Let's go.
[206:07.16]Dude, wait a second.
[206:08.67]Bio break.
[206:09.95]You may go.
[206:10.47]I brought the nuggets.
[206:13.00]Yeah.
[206:14.03]And it always meant shit, by the way, because why wouldn't you just say pee?
[206:18.03]Yeah, what the hell is that?
[206:20.16]Oh my god!
[206:22.10]Oh my god!
[206:23.21]I said go fast!
[206:24.91]I was going fast!
[206:26.79]Nobody scouted that.
[206:28.56]Winch it.
[206:31.28]We could restart back to the previous checkpoint.
[206:34.23]We're going to lose all our stuff.
[206:35.56]Wench it.
[206:36.36]No.
[206:37.56]Wench pole.
[206:39.04]Boom.
[206:39.48]Bingo.
[206:40.44]There's hot lava down there.
[206:43.03]Who's got the winch?
[206:43.67]Pull forward.
[206:45.00]I feel like Poke did this to me.
[206:48.07]Pull that winch forward.
[206:50.02]After everything we've been through.
[206:52.88]That was way steeper of a drop than I had been told.
[206:56.05]Oh, God.
[207:02.60]Wait, wait, wait, the wench.
[207:03.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[207:04.44]He's gunning it.
[207:05.97]We can't stop him.
[207:07.77]What are you doing?
[207:09.29]The wench.
[207:10.84]Why are you just gunning it?
[207:14.05]I gotta go.
[207:15.54]You might be going the wrong way.
[207:16.65]Yeah, I think that path, I have a feeling that path behind you, Vinny.
[207:21.18]Fuck off.
[207:21.92]Wait, we need that remote.
[207:22.96]Where's the winch remote?
[207:24.21]I got it.
[207:24.61]I got it.
[207:25.03]Okay, you got it.
[207:29.35]No, do you see this other path?
[207:30.91]Right behind you guys.
[207:32.88]It might be a good one.
[207:33.99]Why are you throwing the things in here?
[207:36.28]I'll take the winch.
[207:40.75]Thank you.
[207:42.05]Thank you.
[207:43.38]Thank you.
[207:44.02]Go this way.
[207:46.81]No, I'm telling you this way is going to be better.
[207:50.19]This is a scary way.
[207:51.37]Why don't we just go check it out?
[207:52.45]Why don't we just go check it out then?
[207:54.22]Because it requires you to think twice.
[208:03.21]Kind of goes up and, oh.
[208:07.27]Is that a hole?
[208:07.83]This is scary.
[208:08.61]Yes, it's a hole.
[208:09.49]Why do you think we were freaking out?
[208:14.03]okay about to show you why they call me yeah but if you go this way you can oh no if you go this way you're fine Ster the hole
[208:21.93]This way.
[208:25.10]He's just going for it in the hole.
[208:29.17]Okay.
[208:29.65]Oh, and then there's another.
[208:30.55]There's another.
[208:31.16]We need wood.
[208:32.16]We have wood?
[208:33.75]Hold on, let me store this.
[208:37.32]Can we get one of the seven hammers that we have?
[208:40.53]Wait, we need to repair.
[208:45.04]Let's take a repair break.
[208:46.21]This car is fucked up.
[208:48.38]Bio break.
[208:48.90]Go.
[208:49.60]Can you make this?
[208:51.67]Why did Poke break this car?
[208:54.97]Actually, we need to do the tires.
[209:04.25]because they have like they have like the slightest injury hey ask me how I'm doing how you doing I'm bored
[209:15.10]Oh.
[209:16.44]Okay, good.
[209:21.54]Oh my god!
[209:24.57]That was so brutal.
[209:26.03]Okay, you know when you press the back of an action figure and they do like an action move?
[209:31.25]Somebody just flip the lever on the back of the car.
[209:34.27]No, why can't we oh no Stop stop driving
[209:39.52]We can't see a single thing.
[209:41.01]So is this where we were a moment ago?
[209:43.52]It was, wasn't it?
[209:44.38]What?
[209:44.75]Yes.
[209:45.51]Oh my god.
[209:48.29]I'm counting on you guys with the flares out there.
[209:52.31]Wait, aren't you the one that wanted to do the, let's go to the shortcut?
[209:56.61]Yeah, but I wanted you guys to go see what was down it.
[209:58.98]I kept saying, see what's down there.
[210:00.54]I bet it's shorter.
[210:01.25]See what's down there.
[210:02.13]I would like you to do me a favor.
[210:04.42]Let me walk forward right now.
[210:05.72]This is a perfect.
[210:06.48]They're all gonna go get so it was probably worth it fast No, if you look left side you'll make it though
[210:16.47]This way.
[210:19.85]Alright, guys.
[210:20.61]Brace for impact.
[210:21.94]Oh, no.
[210:22.82]That's an EOSV, if I've ever heard one.
[210:30.75]You'll be fine here.
[210:33.64]You're not going... Why are you going so slow?
[210:35.65]That's the slowest...
[210:37.82]This thing sucks.
[210:40.05]That's so slow.
[210:41.89]This thing sucks!
[210:43.05]Oh, no.
[210:44.52]He's... Ster, do you have, like, a food delivery that's showing up in five minutes?
[210:49.92]No.
[210:54.39]I think I'm more checked out than he is.
[210:56.04]He's at least locked in.
[210:57.96]It doesn't go faster.
[210:59.31]There is lava.
[211:01.68]Wait, I winched it to you.
[211:02.54]Can you turn it on?
[211:04.09]I'm pressing it.
[211:05.17]I don't think it worked.
[211:08.03]Why not?
[211:08.29]It's just pulling me.
[211:09.07]Unless I grab you.
[211:12.94]Uh, I'm for pressing it.
[211:17.90]It's gotta be on something sturdier.
[211:24.21]What was it on last time?
[211:25.30]This pole right here.
[211:27.37]Put it on that pole.
[211:28.24]The little, like, piece of wood sticking out.
[211:32.95]Dude, traffic is crazy down here.
[211:34.98]Just bam it.
[211:35.74]Ready?
[211:37.71]This light has been red for like five minutes.
[211:39.78]Did you get it?
[211:40.58]No, it's attached to me.
[211:43.07]Hold on.
[211:43.94]Oh, you're right.
[211:47.39]Get it out of me.
[211:49.02]What did I just do with the remote control?
[211:50.68]Alright, here we go.
[211:52.35]Oh, there you go.
[211:52.99]That was the only problem.
[211:55.44]It's fine.
[211:58.99]Nice.
[212:01.62]Good.
[212:02.08]Alright, now cut it.
[212:03.14]There you go.
[212:03.60]Now take that winch off.
[212:06.59]I never heard that voice.
[212:09.15]Any more flares?
[212:09.89]That was a new one, right?
[212:15.15]There's no control of him anymore.
[212:16.52]He's...
[212:19.29]He's just gone.
[212:20.86]Control me, master.
[212:21.86]Tell me what to do.
[212:22.84]Someone go pick up that flare.
[212:23.71]Someone go pick up that flare right now.
[212:26.09]Where?
[212:27.42]Behind us, the red.
[212:28.27]The red light.
[212:29.25]Fine.
[212:29.85]No one else has a flare?
[212:34.37]Poke the green one.
[212:35.88]This flare is done, man.
[212:40.05]This is the second room.
[212:41.41]No one is moving.
[212:42.27]Everyone's saying, I'm done.
[212:45.55]No one is moving.
[212:46.69]Did I dupe this?
[212:48.02]Why is there another one of these back there?
[212:50.90]Where's the flare?
[212:52.02]It's dark back here, man.
[212:53.81]We can't see shit.
[212:56.84]Is there...
[212:57.22]Wait, I got a flare.
[212:58.56]Alright, where do you want this?
[212:59.34]Right in front of you?
[213:00.67]I need someone to grab me.
[213:01.73]I'm in this hole.
[213:02.84]I'm lighting the flare right now.
[213:04.30]I got you.
[213:04.60]Come back.
[213:04.90]Come back.
[213:05.42]Alright.
[213:05.81]We've got... Guys, I'm stuck in a hole.
[213:07.97]Right here, right here, right here.
[213:08.78]One of my chat members just said, this has turned into RV done yet.
[213:12.67]Guys, help.
[213:13.29]Over here, over here.
[213:14.82]To me.
[213:15.14]Come to me in the corner.
[213:16.93]Guys, help!
[213:18.34]I'm stuck in a hole!
[213:21.63]Was that an explosion?
[213:22.65]Ow!
[213:24.18]I don't know what happened, I'm sorry!
[213:26.67]I just may have actually saved us, I'm sorry.
[213:31.37]Um, that exploded!
[213:32.54]Vinny, that explodes!
[213:34.17]Vinny, it explodes!
[213:37.12]This explodes!
[213:38.87]Alright, alright.
[213:39.81]Wait, why did that- No, wait, what happened to me?
[213:42.70]Anybody know what the fuck just happened?
[213:43.71]Did you step on a landmine, dude?
[213:45.66]I don't know.
[213:46.22]You're good to go?
[213:51.71]Oh, God.
[213:53.00]Be careful of landmines, apparently.
[213:55.02]Let's get these.
[213:55.51]I think we need these.
[213:56.13]Maybe.
[213:56.61]I'm dead.
[213:57.41]I don't know if it was a landmine or it was... Dude, it was like a lava erupting.
[214:03.36]Are you kidding me?
[214:04.28]Are you?
[214:05.41]Look what I just felt.
[214:06.73]Flares and cigarettes ignite that.
[214:09.59]What'd you find?
[214:10.83]I fell in the next set of winches.
[214:12.91]One pixel hole.
[214:15.09]Oh, it's too dark.
[214:16.07]We need we need the flare.
[214:18.21]There's the gas coming out.
[214:19.44]I might have thrown a flare flare.
[214:21.42]There's one here.
[214:23.25]Oh, no.
[214:28.05]Oh my, oh my god.
[214:29.75]That is a terrible thing.
[214:32.53]That should not be in this game.
[214:33.99]Oh, that's, that's very bad.
[214:35.84]Yeah, I don't even want to risk going near it.
[214:40.43]Uh-oh.
[214:41.34]I'm on my own adventure.
[214:42.35]I'm under the law right now.
[214:43.27]Poke, if you could saw your own arm off.
[214:45.21]Wait, can you throw me a flare?
[214:47.47]You're gonna have to crawl through Saddam's chamber.
[214:50.47]Yeah, it's true.
[214:52.46]I don't want to waste the flare, but I'll... You know what?
[214:55.17]For you, Poke, I'll do it.
[214:56.06]No, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[214:56.92]I'm ready to...
[214:58.04]I fell through the map.
[214:59.25]I'm in Azeroth right now.
[215:00.55]I'm in Kalimdor.
[215:01.58]Okay.
[215:04.70]We're not going to leave these winch poles.
[215:07.42]I'm following through the whole map.
[215:08.74]Our vehicle is very damaged.
[215:11.15]We have no scrap.
[215:13.68]Bye.
[215:16.61]What is that I See the whole game this is Dude, you got a probably a cool view then
[215:26.55]I see hell.
[215:27.90]Alright, he's just going, I guess.
[215:31.17]Don't worry about me.
[215:32.48]You guys gotta make it to the next grave.
[215:41.03]Uh oh.
[215:43.42]Did it say checkpoint?
[215:49.50]This is bad.
[215:57.57]Hurray.
[215:59.61]Is there a crouch?
[216:06.71]Somebody needs to save Germany.
[216:08.10]Vincent has officially checked out.
[216:10.90]In most social circumstances...
[216:14.39]I do this regardless.
[216:16.19]I just take a little time to myself.
[216:18.54]But I rejoined, don't worry.
[216:19.95]Hey, we're good.
[216:21.23]Everything's good.
[216:21.99]Listen, this isn't a sponsor, man.
[216:23.38]We're just chilling, yeah.
[216:24.84]We're just farting, burping, doesn't matter.
[216:29.44]Ster, can one of you guys come back to the bridge?
[216:34.78]No.
[216:35.98]Are you sure?
[216:36.46]Because I've got a giant golden key.
[216:43.19]No.
[216:44.68]Engine's kind of repaired.
[216:46.97]One of these days I'd like to do...
[216:48.40]I would actually like to play a game that's kind of long.
[216:51.73]That we have to do sessions for.
[216:54.01]I got one.
[216:55.98]Four Swords Adventure.
[216:57.21]The GameCube game.
[216:59.04]The Zelda one.
[217:01.99]Okay, there you go.
[217:03.06]That's why it's, you know, I would throw my, that would be my suggestion.
[217:09.42]Me and Jerma have been planning this, where we go to Grandmaster and League of Legends in one session.
[217:16.24]Okay, we can do that.
[217:17.87]I've played League maybe twice in my life.
[217:21.15]Abiotic factors type stuff?
[217:22.30]I would rather smash my face into a brick wall five to ten times before doing that, by the way.
[217:29.71]Minecraft someone's okay well that's like you'd be a sick mouth fight if you don't hurt yourself just saying
[217:39.02]I think someone has to hold this button.
[217:41.70]I made it out.
[217:42.50]I'm here.
[217:43.57]Malphite is really strong right now.
[217:47.71]Who's the worst League of Legends champion, tier list-wise?
[217:53.45]Um...
[217:55.20]whatever poke plays.
[218:00.43]I'm a tearless Andy, dude.
[218:02.22]You know what I'm saying?
[218:03.32]I'm...
[218:03.42]I'm a huge update to Barony.
[218:07.41]Dude, Barony is a game I do want to learn.
[218:10.10]Let's talk about that again when that update drops.
[218:13.53]I'm totally fucking down.
[218:15.76]I've heard only good things about Barony, dude.
[218:17.57]Yeah, me too.
[218:18.33]Me too.
[218:19.05]It's like super in-depth.
[218:20.96]Jerma, weren't you telling me you did not like it?
[218:23.15]Um, something just happened to me, but I played Barony for the first, like, I just couldn't do it, man.
[218:28.36]It was just too much.
[218:29.17]It was like, I couldn't, I didn't like it at all.
[218:31.65]I gotta be honest.
[218:33.09]Fair enough.
[218:42.17]I'm sorry.
[218:42.59]I have to be honest.
[218:43.97]I'm not going to lie.
[218:44.44]That's okay.
[218:44.72]That's good.
[218:45.32]Honest is good.
[218:46.08]You don't want to... Like, for example, abiotic factor, I love.
[218:50.54]I got burnt so hard on that game because it was 40 hours of just like...
[218:55.08]It is long.
[218:55.80]survival of just like drinking coffee and making food and like not making progress and dying and dying and dying.
[219:03.13]And then they dropped an update.
[219:05.27]that allows you to customize it.
[219:09.15]So it's a great game.
[219:10.53]I have a little cameo in it.
[219:12.32]I love it, but I don't know if I could
[219:15.07]Oh, you didn't play after that stuff.
[219:16.86]Like, customizable.
[219:18.00]I got to my cameo, and predictably, I stopped.
[219:22.66]I played with Jolly.
[219:23.78]And like, uh, fucking, uh... God, my mom's... Park it!
[219:28.23]Press park!
[219:30.48]Ugh, I'm so predictable.
[219:33.25]Vinny.
[219:34.73]Yeah.
[219:38.95]Who?
[219:39.79]Honestly, Vinny.
[219:41.72]Yeah.
[219:42.71]Vinny, we're a little doomed here if we don't have the ability to shot rope.
[219:49.82]I got a winch pole here.
[219:51.31]I'm scavenging back.
[219:52.19]I think I can go to the left and get it.
[219:54.61]We got a winch pole.
[219:57.53]I say you just wing it, bro.
[219:58.84]Full speed to the left, you can do it.
[220:01.19]Yeah.
[220:04.74]Wait, how are you going to get... Uh-oh.
[220:06.76]Oh, dear.
[220:10.28]When I say full speed, you know,
[220:15.06]I don't know what I was saying.
[220:16.17]Just be careful.
[220:17.73]Full speed, but be careful.
[220:19.14]Yeah, but we got that one.
[220:20.10]More speed.
[220:21.20]But Vinny left.
[220:22.63]I'm here.
[220:22.99]I'm just looking.
[220:25.66]There's stuff under the bridge.
[220:27.07]I'm still falling under the map.
[220:28.67]I can see the world getting smaller still.
[220:31.75]How big is this Earth?
[220:34.46]Poke, I'm trying to...
[220:36.39]Why is every game like have infinite worlds?
[220:41.39]All these new games have infinite worlds, dude.
[220:43.42]It's crazy.
[220:44.44]Yeah.
[220:44.86]There should also just be a respawn button for exactly that kind of shit.
[220:50.91]Wait, should I just rejoin?
[220:52.53]I'm still leaving rejoin.
[220:54.94]That's a good idea.
[220:57.71]I can't get back to Ster.
[220:59.36]I think, Poke, unfortunately, you might go to the checkpoint, which is it's pitch black for, like, a mile.
[221:05.89]It's going to be hard to navigate back to where they are.
[221:08.49]Pistons under the bridge.
[221:09.70]Wait, I'm literally in the car.
[221:11.80]Wait, what?
[221:12.46]I'm literally back in the car.
[221:13.96]If you just want to come back, just rejoin.
[221:15.79]Oh, shit.
[221:16.05]You need to turn your mic on and off.
[221:18.52]Okay.
[221:18.74]What?
[221:19.57]Hello.
[221:19.85]Hi, how are you?
[221:20.69]Hi, how are you?
[221:21.65]Hey there.
[221:22.17]Oh, look at that.
[221:22.60]There's immersive audio.
[221:24.41]I'm coming back.
[221:25.81]Hello.
[221:26.56]This winch needs to be further forward.
[221:28.34]Oh, my God.
[221:28.95]Don't.
[221:29.41]Don't.
[221:30.93]Someone come down here.
[221:32.02]Was it loud?
[221:33.40]Was it loud again?
[221:36.15]It was horrendous.
[221:39.14]Blame Vinny.
[221:40.30]He's alone.
[221:42.17]Look what I found.
[221:42.78]Look what I found, guys.
[221:43.56]I can do this.
[221:47.49]Sorry, sorry.
[221:48.47]Sorry, everybody.
[221:53.51]Where's it going?
[221:55.12]What the hell?
[221:55.54]Wait, what's happening?
[221:57.25]I can activate these pressure plates.
[221:59.43]Pressure plates, pressure plates.
[222:01.54]What is going on?
[222:02.83]You're all talking in the game again.
[222:04.58]No, no.
[222:07.61]Turn this fucking song off!
[222:13.04]I'm back in the car too, this is cool.
[222:15.79]Uh oh, how do you get up?
[222:16.88]Oh, this is bad.
[222:20.07]Yeah, we might have to wench backwards, actually.
[222:22.59]This is not... pulling forward.
[222:28.70]without flipping it.
[222:30.07]I think we have to pull you back.
[222:34.82]Those pressure plates are too... No, I have an idea.
[222:39.14]I can pull you back to here.
[222:41.65]Put a wench up on the rock up here.
[222:44.58]and then wench up.
[222:48.05]Do you want, Sturdy, do you want me to, should we pull you forward or pull you back?
[222:53.13]Uh, if we have a rod, then we could do what Poke is saying.
[222:55.85]That would work.
[222:57.54]I don't know if we have a rod down there.
[222:59.91]Let me see.
[223:00.37]I don't see one.
[223:01.55]Do we have one of those things that push the front up that Vinny was using?
[223:06.11]Can you res me?
[223:07.68]Not those things that you're using right now, but like... You know what I mean?
[223:12.00]when we were in the mud?
[223:12.84]There's pressure plates down here, guys, that we have to activate.
[223:16.40]I've taken so much fall damage for no reason.
[223:20.27]I think we put bosses on them.
[223:21.79]Hey, we got a winch right here.
[223:25.75]What do you want?
[223:30.66]Alright, got the winch.
[223:31.95]Pull.
[223:34.00]And you're saying to stick this...
[223:37.49]Your ass.
[223:40.40]Alright, what do we want it?
[223:42.85]I'm gonna push you up on the rock on the roof.
[223:45.07]Ready?
[223:45.67]Wait, hold on.
[223:46.33]Poke, you do this.
[223:47.36]This is a poke thing.
[223:48.80]This is not... Jerma's like, we'll make a joke about somebody doing this, not actually do it.
[223:55.35]Where do you want to go?
[223:57.00]It's 3, 2, 1, up in the sky.
[223:58.43]Up in the sky.
[223:58.89]Ready?
[223:59.46]Here you go.
[224:04.90]Never mind.
[224:05.36]You can't put it there.
[224:07.48]I think we can do this where we lift the front.
[224:09.81]Uh-oh.
[224:10.52]You can't pick this up?
[224:11.90]No.
[224:12.79]They are one-time use.
[224:13.91]I got it.
[224:14.41]I got it.
[224:16.42]You just bumped me.
[224:20.73]Man Ster so fucking crashed out right now.
[224:23.40]Yeah, he did.
[224:25.10]He was screaming earlier.
[224:26.25]How do I?
[224:30.01]oh spare tire okay alright you dude actually poke that's in the way now and the car is gonna hit it
[224:39.61]No way.
[224:45.37]Hang on.
[224:45.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[224:46.78]We can follow you from here.
[224:47.86]I got this.
[224:52.98]Oh, shit.
[224:55.74]Oh!
[224:57.67]Excellent.
[225:00.98]We lost a bunch of stuff.
[225:05.17]Okay.
[225:05.84]We need to grab some of that stuff.
[225:08.10]Burger spell.
[225:10.04]I got him, though.
[225:12.33]There's Flipatronic down here.
[225:13.89]It's the
[225:20.79]OK, um.
[225:25.00]Where's the truck?
[225:30.15]Let's repair a little bit this thing.
[225:31.66]This thing is about to explode.
[225:34.15]If it touches anything, it blows up.
[225:36.54]We need the thing, the welder.
[225:39.32]uh flat tires can be fixed with a drill we have a lot of scrap too though so I think we're oh yeah oh the scrap yes yes you're correct
[225:48.36]Which tire isn't flat?
[225:52.30]You can see the screws are out a little bit.
[225:57.27]in the ones that are... Oh, my God.
[225:59.91]Oh, my God, I did it.
[226:03.03]Are we good?
[226:03.99]Hold on.
[226:05.29]What's down here?
[226:06.36]I can't see anything man.
[226:11.33]Let me fix these tires.
[226:13.56]Wait, there's another pressure plate somewhere.
[226:14.86]I got it.
[226:18.20]Oh, there's two though.
[226:18.87]I got the other box.
[226:20.03]That is so satisfying.
[226:29.84]Oh, it's... Was it too much?
[226:33.25]It should be good.
[226:37.31]We... Well...
[226:38.85]We could lower it a little bit.
[226:41.16]No, that's good.
[226:41.74]Wow.
[226:42.26]Okay.
[226:42.75]Wow.
[226:43.75]Wow.
[226:45.94]We're doing okay in spite of ourselves.
[226:49.09]And I don't want to take anything away from Ster, because you're doing a great job, sweetie, but... Man.
[226:53.53]I feel like we're, like, lucking into solutions.
[226:57.90]Oh!
[226:59.57]I got a hell of scrap metal down here.
[227:00.78]Oh, when I do it, it's luck.
[227:02.83]No, not you.
[227:03.39]I mean us as a group, but yes, also you.
[227:05.94]Yeah, grab that scrap.
[227:07.11]I'm doing repairs.
[227:09.82]Wow, that was the most Boston Jerma I've heard in a long time.
[227:15.96]Yeah, it's working over here.
[227:17.89]Oh, God.
[227:21.21]Did you get that, Scrap?
[227:26.37]Pokey, you alright?
[227:27.55]Okay, this looks like a difficult maneuver.
[227:30.47]And talk if I'm dead, it sucks.
[227:32.78]Aww.
[227:33.16]That little maneuver cost us 25 years, Murr.
[227:38.14]This is quite the maneuver, you're right.
[227:40.77]Well, I'm gonna get lucky real quick here.
[227:46.24]Just in case you need extra support.
[227:50.76]I need to know if I'm about to like fall off and tell me to stop because I can't see down.
[227:55.40]Alright.
[227:59.33]Like, what is the front tires doing here?
[228:01.74]Front tires?
[228:02.08]You got to lower the bridge?
[228:03.60]Wait, really?
[228:04.70]You... Oh, my God.
[228:06.51]This is tight.
[228:07.27]This is going to be rough, dude.
[228:09.32]You need to cut it to the left pretty hard.
[228:12.29]I would even back up a little.
[228:14.69]Okay.
[228:15.03]I need like someone behind me.
[228:16.26]Tell me how much to tell me to back up someone in front.
[228:19.34]Yeah, I'll go behind you for a second.
[228:23.25]Is it possible to get you?
[228:24.78]I don't know.
[228:26.44]Can I get back up?
[228:27.63]I'm scared.
[228:30.45]Maybe.
[228:31.53]Be careful backing up here.
[228:32.60]You might not even be able to.
[228:34.55]Your tire's going to go into the...
[228:38.09]Hold on.
[228:39.30]How much room do I have?
[228:40.94]You have like an inch.
[228:45.32]Stop right there.
[228:47.68]If you go...
[228:48.90]Okay.
[228:49.66]You could go back a tiny bit more.
[228:52.88]Like, a tiny bit.
[228:53.82]Like, one little, like...
[228:57.24]Okay, that's it.
[228:59.09]Now I would go, I would cut it left.
[229:01.35]Because it's going to be, dude, you're going to have to back up again, I think.
[229:03.86]This is such a narrow little place to go.
[229:07.15]Okay.
[229:08.21]Actually, you're fine.
[229:09.98]Go straight.
[229:11.71]Okay.
[229:12.15]Now stop.
[229:13.92]You're gonna have to go straight.
[229:16.90]Straight forward.
[229:17.73]Straight forward for like a little blip.
[229:20.99]Okay, now cut to the left.
[229:23.86]Alright.
[229:24.62]Stop.
[229:24.96]Straight.
[229:26.05]Now cut to the left again after the...
[229:27.52]Okay, cut to the left hard.
[229:31.15]Okay, keep cutting left.
[229:33.19]I feel like the car is falling.
[229:35.30]Are you sure?
[229:36.00]More left?
[229:37.53]More left.
[229:37.97]Yeah, a little bit more left.
[229:41.66]We're left and straight, and you're good.
[229:43.91]Okay, I think...
[229:46.82]Honestly...
[229:48.14]Honestly...
[229:49.30]Hold on.
[229:53.10]You... Let me move these out of the way, because it's going to fuck you up.
[229:58.10]You can back up, yeah.
[229:59.29]A little bit.
[230:00.03]You have a decent amount of room.
[230:01.25]I'll tell you when to stop.
[230:04.34]Stop.
[230:04.94]Wait!
[230:05.41]Stop!
[230:10.09]I want to see what's going on.
[230:11.36]Hey, can one of you guys poke?
[230:14.06]Can you throw like a plank at me?
[230:16.03]I'm dead.
[230:16.78]Okay, honestly, do you want to know my real opinion, dude?
[230:21.43]What?
[230:22.56]If you go straight from here...
[230:27.05]I think you actually, hold on.
[230:30.61]Oh, yeah, this is doable.
[230:32.20]I think that's doable, but hold on.
[230:34.05]Should I move a plank over to the right?
[230:35.45]You might have to actually, yeah, people are saying full send it.
[230:37.22]You might have to just full send it.
[230:38.73]I think this is fine.
[230:40.00]I think you have enough room to get down here.
[230:41.32]He's got this.
[230:41.66]He's got this.
[230:42.13]You're overthinking it.
[230:43.39]Down and left.
[230:44.48]Easy.
[230:45.26]There.
[230:45.52]You're the god.
[230:46.43]Boom.
[230:47.15]Oh, man!
[230:48.72]Wow!
[230:50.11]That was... that worked.
[230:53.65]Nice.
[230:55.52]Thanks for being honest with me, guys.
[230:57.77]Oh, Vinny, you were in here the whole time?
[230:59.48]I was in there.
[230:59.98]I did a thing.
[231:00.98]I had to activate that, yeah.
[231:04.82]There's a secret room up here.
[231:07.29]Uh, that's where I came from.
[231:08.92]And there's a snake in there and some scrap that I got.
[231:12.11]Okay, so what's down here?
[231:13.27]Uh, you're clear, sir.
[231:14.64]You're clear.
[231:15.28]Garage.
[231:19.78]Another checkpoint?
[231:20.67]Oh, damn.
[231:22.39]but be careful on that on the on your left side just keep to hold hug the right wall what happened here
[231:34.82]Hell yeah.
[231:36.70]I thought my house exploded I thought my house exploded
[231:46.35]Fuck was that?
[231:47.13]I have no idea.
[231:48.22]That scared the shit out of me, Paul.
[231:51.16]No.
[231:53.62]I'm not trying to fuck with you guys.
[231:56.03]I swear I feel terrible.
[231:58.14]Dude, that was as if you blew an air horn in my head.
[232:03.19]Sorry to everybody.
[232:04.19]It was also purely my left ear.
[232:07.15]I apologize deeply to everybody.
[232:08.67]No, it's okay.
[232:10.25]It's okay.
[232:12.23]Oh, my God, man.
[232:14.17]Hey, at least we're playing a horror game too.
[232:15.84]Okay.
[232:16.86]I am so glad that I actually have this turned down like 30% at a hard level.
[232:23.00]But it was still awful.
[232:26.83]What the f- I thought there was something happening in the game!
[232:30.90]No, no more sound effects.
[232:33.99]Sound effects are banned for the rest of the evening.
[232:35.85]Okay, good.
[232:38.26]Repair this shit.
[232:40.92]We don't have a repair hammer.
[232:44.84]Oh my god, dude.
[232:46.51]I kind of accidentally did a lot of damage to the vehicle just now by slowly moving it forward.
[232:53.44]dead for a while I thought I was you know I was chilling I was blowing it up how'd that do something here to see what this sounds like on my what's up
[233:03.38]Yeah, just do it again and we can hear how loud it is.
[233:05.76]Why does part of me think that you did that to listen to the clip after?
[233:11.57]Oh, that's going to amuse him for like a couple hours.
[233:15.94]Easily.
[233:19.50]Okay, we need to repair.
[233:23.21]Oh, cool hat.
[233:27.95]Yeah.
[233:29.42]Yeah, real funny.
[233:30.34]Real funny guy, huh?
[233:34.72]Laugh it up, fuzzball.
[233:39.45]Okay.
[233:42.36]Put the hammer back in the RV.
[233:47.93]I mean, well, you.
[233:52.00]I'm good.
[233:53.24]Alright.
[233:53.97]It was the loudest thing I've heard because I was like, you know, we were getting to safety.
[233:58.02]We had accomplished a thing, and I was paying attention to a thing on the ground, so my attention was fully diverted.
[234:05.43]Yeah.
[234:05.95]and you scare like I jumped in my seat and that doesn't happen a lot for me so I knew it would be a fart in game but I didn't know loud wait that was in game that wasn't even on Discord
[234:15.89]No one loves the game.
[234:19.57]I'm so glad I have this shit turned down.
[234:21.09]It was very bad, but I would...
[234:23.60]If I would put it on the scale of...
[234:25.92]No, no sound effects are banned for the rest of the evening.
[234:30.39]If I have a sailor... Bring them into the RV, just in case.
[234:33.62]Yeah, we definitely need to take them all.
[234:35.27]Are we going this way?
[234:36.25]No, is that the way we came from?
[234:38.88]I'll tell you what.
[234:45.44]You know, Polk, I think it's because this, we're in an, ready, I'm going to turn my mic on.
[234:49.28]Like Vinny, you just talked.
[234:50.96]We're in an echoey area.
[234:54.03]That is loud by itself.
[234:56.20]Right, by itself.
[234:57.55]So, Poke, you did the fart and it echoed off of every wall in the cave and exploded.
[235:06.89]I have a feeling this is the home stretch right here.
[235:10.75]Someone said earlier we were halfway through, like maybe like a half hour ago.
[235:18.15]I mean, it feels like the volcano has to be the end and we can't be that.
[235:23.48]We seem pretty far.
[235:24.97]I mean, I would imagine it's it looks like we have to go down and around.
[235:30.38]Somebody said there's about four more checkpoints from here.
[235:33.47]Yeah, that's probably going to be another several hours.
[235:37.69]It was way worse for Vinny.
[235:39.90]oh you heard my clip okay okay yours was like left ear you were right in my face screaming somehow yeah so
[235:49.50]Yeah.
[235:52.17]I'm going to listen to this.
[235:55.58]Chad, I'm sorry.
[235:56.26]This might be loud.
[235:59.19]There's snakes in the car?
[236:02.21]right outside I went out to check and I just got killed by a snake I gotta eat these sardines I'm sorry guys it was so it was in my ears so bad
[236:11.30]You heard it again?
[236:12.05]Yeah, I just listened.
[236:14.03]Fart terrorism.
[236:22.34]It's funny because I swear I didn't mean to make him laugh.
[236:26.65]It's actually, you know, it was worth it.
[236:28.20]It's fucking hilarious, so you're good.
[236:30.07]Poke, it's funny.
[236:31.14]I almost feel like you were apologizing for it while you pressed the button.
[236:35.75]Because the reaction was like I just nuked something.
[236:39.91]Oh my god, those fucking snakes are still there.
[236:45.51]Guys, I don't know if I have it in me if there's four more with how late it is.
[236:50.26]That's alright.
[236:51.34]I don't either.
[236:53.12]Those are the vibes.
[236:55.07]Okay.
[236:55.83]I think we ended on that fart, man.
[236:56.88]That was great.
[236:57.44]That was a fart ending, I think.
[236:59.19]alright I'm just gonna send it well it was fun as man it was fun
[237:08.46]There's snakes down here too.
[237:09.74]I'm dead.
[237:10.14]Could have been a little bit more effort.
[237:12.07]There could have been more effort there.
[237:13.35]Like there was a bridge.
[237:13.97]I fell out of the car and died to a snake.
[237:16.40]Thanks.
[237:20.15]The game does have a checkpoint respawn, so you can make horrendously egregious mistakes and still be alright.
[237:27.18]Yeah, this game is fun.
[237:28.07]I like this game a lot.
[237:28.81]really nice chill game I think it's good I liked this way more than I expected like the first 20 minutes I was like eh
[237:37.72]And then it was pretty great after that.
[237:39.87]The cooperation and the teamwork is really nice.
[237:43.77]Yeah, this is great.
[237:44.73]I loved it.
[237:47.91]I could, if the devs watching, I would just give more like ambient sound and some music.
[237:55.90]I just feel like I was just empty.
[237:57.34]I think we were supposed to be the ambience we did turn the radio off there is a radio
[238:05.46]Alright, I'm gonna do...
[238:06.40]But I love the game.
[238:07.07]It was great.
[238:07.77]Amazing.
[238:09.70]I'm going to get out of here before there's another fart nuke.
[238:13.99]I felt like one was coming.
[238:17.46]Bye.
[238:21.63]Alright.
[238:23.05]Quitting.
[238:24.08]Alright, boys.
[238:24.74]Fellas, it was really, really good to hang again.
[238:27.57]It was real.
[238:33.24]real when I got back from Vegas I was a little sad because uh you know it's so fun we had so much fun and poke like I said genuinely we're gonna bust your balls a little bit but
[238:41.78]Did you guys hear that?
[238:45.12]That was pretty.
[238:45.76]That was weird.
[238:46.32]That was what you like.
[238:49.21]Don't make conversation.
[238:50.43]And then you just sped up really fast.
[238:52.96]You get a clip like one of your channels.
[238:55.11]I was like, how are you talking so fast?
[238:59.52]I thought you were doing that not, it wasn't a lag.
[239:01.37]I thought you were doing that that fast.
[239:02.58]I was like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[239:05.10]I even throwing in like a sentimental moment.
[239:07.71]Damn.
[239:07.93]Alright.
[239:08.17]Well, regardless, I, you know, I'm going to listen to the clip, but I really like hanging out with you guys.
[239:12.85]It was fun.
[239:13.54]We made progress.
[239:14.45]We went on a camping trip.
[239:15.44]We had burgers together.
[239:17.53]That's good.
[239:18.12]We got to get more games like this and less like the rat game.
[239:21.47]Yeah, I'd like to say that it's canon that we all died in the volcano together.
[239:26.55]It's true.
[239:27.76]Dude, I'll tell you the vibes, I was having fun in that game, but then all the voices, all the high-pitched voices,
[239:34.61]and then the dude dude the chat vibes were rancid during that too they were actually was it actually
[239:42.51]For like five to ten minutes.
[239:44.82]I think it was like a hundred guys.
[239:46.17]Yeah, there was a little while.
[239:49.87]Oh, that's funny.
[239:51.01]I think my chat enjoys video games.
[239:56.86]It was fun.
[239:57.24]That was funny.
[239:59.99]A little rancid.
[240:00.90]Never hurt anybody.
[240:02.68]Alright.
[240:03.64]Now, I'm going to go eat some raw chicken.
[240:05.61]You guys have a good one.
[240:06.71]I'm glad we get to have Thanksgiving dinner together.
[240:08.76]That was fun.
[240:10.08]Yeah, maybe in a couple weeks we can figure out another game or we could just finish this.
[240:16.16]I'm down, we could do this and then we could play another one.
[240:18.47]Wait until February.
[240:21.90]I think we find a new game.
[240:23.12]It'll be good.
[240:23.60]I'm fine with that.
[240:24.63]We got plenty of options.
[240:26.44]But it was great.
[240:27.08]We got a lot of stuff stocked up after the drought.
[240:31.06]And...
[240:31.60]The video too, that little Thanksgiving experiment, that was fun.
[240:36.65]I'm glad you guys all had fun doing it.
[240:38.66]I had fun doing it.
[240:39.36]I thought it was great and I'm happy.
[240:41.47]Yeah, me too.
[240:42.60]It was fun.
[240:44.20]Oh, man, I just listened to the me speeding up clip.
[240:46.31]It was pretty good.
[240:48.00]Alright.
[240:48.44]Alright, guys.
[240:50.34]Hey, it was a pleasure.
[240:51.37]Good night.
[240:51.99]See you.
[240:52.93]Thank you.
[240:53.51]Bye, everybody.
[240:55.24]Have a great night.
[240:55.76]Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[240:58.03]Very cool.
[241:00.98]Yeah, the Rat Game was alright.
[241:02.68]It was...
[241:04.37]For me, it was more a Ster of running around behind me doing that Roblox shit.
[241:08.89]Just the high-pitched voices.
[241:10.11]When three people have a high-pitched voice...
[241:13.87]I know you could probably turn it off, but I mean, that's the point is to keep it on, but.
[241:20.65]Um, I couldn't take it anymore.
[241:23.47]And then I looked over a chat and it was just like, it was like a, people were screaming.
[241:27.15]So I was like, holy shit.
[241:30.81]I thought the vibes were great though.
[241:32.10]I had a great time the whole time.
[241:36.09]I couldn't tell who was talking most of the time.
[241:38.74]Yeah, it was very confusing.
[241:49.85]But I, that was a great, I had a great time.
[241:53.59]I know that anytime we kind of get together, we kind of have a good time, but
[241:59.69]Seems like there was a lot that happened today.
[242:03.81]Vibes were amazing.
[242:06.47]Thanks for watching.
[242:07.58]Thanks for hanging out.
[242:08.44]And I was gone for about a month, I know.
[242:11.13]It will not be another month before you see me again.
[242:21.61]I'll probably see you guys in the next day or two.
[242:25.00]I'm probably going to just do something and just kind of stream something for fun just for a little bit.
[242:30.20]We'll chill it down.
[242:31.26]We'll slow it down.
[242:36.86]Should be a good time though.
[242:38.37]I think somebody said the biggest problem with that game is that there was a trailer that was AI gen. And then after they released it, they said we didn't use AI.
[242:44.98]Yeah, I get it.
[242:47.11]But I get it.
[242:51.05]I get how people would be annoyed.
[242:53.92]We just saw that it was like a rat slop game.
[242:56.68]We're like, oh, okay.
[242:58.45]Let's try it.
[243:03.14]But I did, look, I had fun because the people I played with were fun.
[243:08.46]That's all you need to say.
[243:09.64]That's all there is to it.
[243:18.44]Would you play Tears of the Kingdom?
[243:23.86]Uh, I would, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to give you an unequivocal absolutely no.
[243:29.23]Sorry, but it is no.
[243:33.70]Dude, he hated Breath of the Wild.
[243:35.00]It's not gonna happen.
[243:36.11]I didn't hate Breath of the Wild.
[243:37.35]I just complained for four hours out of a 40-hour playthrough.
[243:42.23]That's like 10% complaining.
[243:46.57]I didn't give it a 0.0.
[243:56.48]I gave it like an 8.4 or something, didn't I?
[243:59.01]That's a good game.
[244:01.50]I know I just said that like somebody that's trying to, uh,
[244:05.91]Like, placate an audience, but whatever.
[244:09.16]Who gives a shit?
[244:21.54]I don't really know what I'm going to play next, but just keep an eye on the Sus the next couple of days.
[244:30.84]See you guys soon.
[244:31.82]Take care of yourselves, obviously.
[244:33.61]I gotta get the outro video.
[244:35.92]I know I say that every time, but it is what it is.
[244:55.03]Hey, you're ugly?
[244:58.01]No, when I look in the mirror, I see.
[245:02.79]Every time I look in the mirror, I just go...
[245:06.59]I'd go, I'd turn side to side.
[245:08.68]I'd turn around, flex my back muscles.
[245:11.51]Fists up into the... take a look at those.
[245:13.49]Take a look at those fucking back muscles.
[245:22.98]What does that have to do with being ugly?
[245:25.68]I don't know.
[245:27.13]Alright, I had a great time.
[245:27.89]That was an amazing stream.
[245:29.28]I actually had a...
[245:30.16]In my opinion, that was an amazing time.
[245:31.55]I had a lot of fun.
[245:32.19]There was a lot that happened.
[245:33.63]Go to play with the 4H.
[245:37.27]Poke wants that to stick.
[245:39.88]We'll see.
[245:41.04]He brought it up in the DMs.
[245:43.87]But talk to you guys soon.
[245:45.71]Take care of yourselves.
[245:46.74]Have a great night.
[245:48.23]Call your mother if you haven't.
[245:52.73]See you later.
