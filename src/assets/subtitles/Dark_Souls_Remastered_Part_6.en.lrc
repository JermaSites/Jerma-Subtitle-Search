[01:44.47]So, hold on.
[01:50.39]It's fucking humidity, man.
[01:51.46]I'm telling you.
[01:52.36]It's humidity.
[01:57.59]What's today?
[01:58.29]Today?
[01:58.55]Is today Tuesday?
[01:59.99]Yeah.
[02:00.95]Welcome to Tuesday, a new week.
[02:03.91]We're gonna pick back up with Dark Souls Remastered.
[02:07.78]I have a general understanding of what I need to do and where I need to go.
[02:10.84]So this... I'm not gonna like be running around like a moron not knowing what the fuck I'm doing.
[02:16.54]I spent like about 30 minutes before the stream just making sure I knew what the fuck I was doing.
[02:21.72]So don't worry.
[02:23.12]I know exactly where we're going first.
[02:26.02]You know, up here.
[02:27.09]I've been using it.
[02:31.17]It's Wednesday.
[02:31.83]It's not Wednesday.
[02:32.55]Well, actually, it might be Wednesday for some of you guys.
[02:36.03]I think there's a bee stuck in my window.
[02:38.81]Yeah, there is.
[02:40.09]Is that a bee?
[02:42.99]You know, the glass to the mesh?
[02:47.59]I think he's... I'm going to have to let him out.
[02:49.09]Hold on.
[02:51.50]What are you doing in here?
[02:54.80]Go.
[02:56.27]Come on.
[02:56.69]Go.
[02:57.50]Get.
[02:59.52]Go.
[03:00.00]Come on.
[03:05.06]He's fine.
[03:08.20]In fact, he's dead.
[03:10.56]He was just dead hanging on there.
[03:11.86]He's dead.
[03:14.12]I didn't kill him.
[03:16.40]He's dead.
[03:16.72]So, alright.
[03:22.39]I'm just kidding.
[03:23.23]Jesus Christ.
[03:25.63]You guys are too easy sometimes.
[03:26.85]Alright, let's go.
[03:29.25]You already know what we're doing.
[03:33.47]Bring it back to Firelink.
[03:36.71]And here is Firelink.
[03:37.63]Alright, let me make sure my audio is good enough for me to not freak out.
[03:45.32]I might want to lower it a little bit, just for me.
[03:47.54]Let's see.
[03:49.74]Volume Mixer.
[03:53.99]Adjust the volume.
[03:55.33]Yeah.
[03:56.13]Just a little.
[03:57.35]Just a little for me, you know?
[04:00.85]Okay, that's better, right?
[04:02.31]Can you guys hear it?
[04:04.65]Or did I ruin everything?
[04:09.72]Tim Allen is so much louder.
[04:16.66]Sounds too quiet.
[04:17.42]Well, hold on.
[04:17.80]I think I can fix that.
[04:20.09]I'm pretty sure I can fix that for you guys.
[04:22.85]What if I go like this, this, this?
[04:29.51]That should be in a decent spot, right?
[04:36.88]Bring back the hamburger guy?
[04:40.10]What hamburger guy?
[04:40.96]Oh, he's talking about Orson Welles.
[04:45.08]Hey, bring back the hamburger guy.
[04:49.49]Okay, guys, let's go.
[04:51.05]Here's what I want to do first.
[04:52.67]First thing is first.
[04:55.09]I want to go back to the Stray Demon.
[04:56.92]I need to go back up to where the nest is, sit in the nest, and I want to go kill that demon.
[05:02.96]Very important.
[05:03.94]Because all the things that I want to clean up a little before we go to the last part of the game, because that's where we are, right?
[05:10.10]We have maybe 30-40% of the game left.
[05:14.92]So I'd like to clean up some of the areas.
[05:19.13]What is that noise?
[05:21.45]I don't know.
[05:22.13]I've never heard it before in my life.
[05:26.20]One last thing.
[05:27.24]I feel like I need to... How do I do this?
[05:33.30]How do I make this work for me?
[05:36.46]I need to get an equalizer or something.
[05:40.45]Because for some reason I can never get my audio just right.
[05:44.75]It's always too loud for me and too quiet for you guys.
[05:47.81]Only on specific games.
[05:54.63]I think that's a sweet spot right there.
[05:56.29]Let's see.
[05:57.99]I would consider that a sweet spot.
[05:59.19]Alright, let's go.
[06:01.97]I know I need to go this way.
[06:05.26]The sub sound is the largest part.
[06:07.26]I know.
[06:08.92]Lower the monkey sub sound.
[06:10.62]God damn it.
[06:14.32]Alright, hold on.
[06:15.90]I just put that in like two days ago.
[06:23.11]Lower the fucking monkey.
[06:24.75]God damn it, you idiot.
[06:26.27]Fuck.
[06:29.28]Hold on, wait.
[06:29.82]I gotta get in the right spot.
[06:30.86]I gotta get ready.
[06:31.98]Get rid of that sub sound.
[06:33.90]I can't.
[06:38.28]Come on, I haven't played in like five days.
[06:40.56]Six days.
[06:41.70]I need to remember what I'm doing.
[06:43.72]Delete the monkey.
[06:44.73]I can't right now.
[06:45.69]You're gonna have to deal with it.
[06:47.87]I'll lower it.
[06:51.40]I'll lower it in just a minute.
[06:53.42]Let me just... Okay, hold on.
[06:55.68]I'm going to lower the monkey sound by a little bit.
[06:58.36]Just bear with me here.
[06:59.68]That one's not getting lowered.
[07:00.92]I refuse.
[07:04.19]Alert box.
[07:08.17]There's my subscriptions.
[07:09.69]Okay.
[07:12.31]I'm sorry, guys.
[07:14.09]There's Tim Allen.
[07:15.03]There we go.
[07:17.84]So now...
[07:20.31]This shouldn't be as loud as it is now.
[07:24.13]That's about, that's 15% lower than what it is now.
[07:28.75]Save.
[07:31.17]I don't know if it worked.
[07:32.06]I'm going to have to hit save again.
[07:34.24]That should have done it.
[07:35.36]I think we're good.
[07:38.20]Alright, let's go.
[07:40.88]Hey, see, that's better.
[07:41.54]Alright, something just came in my mouth.
[07:45.43]What is this?
[07:46.77]What is that?
[07:47.49]Why is there something in my mouth?
[07:50.54]What in the name of God is that?
[07:52.00]It's like... That's like a big piece of cotton.
[07:55.38]What is this?
[07:59.26]Why is that in my mouth?
[08:01.56]I didn't do anything.
[08:02.68]I just drank up... Okay, you know what?
[08:04.42]I'm freaking out right now.
[08:07.02]That's from Dunkin' Donuts.
[08:08.54]I've been drinking this coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.
[08:10.40]They like... Somebody like poisoned me.
[08:13.97]What is this?
[08:14.75]Why is... Whatever.
[08:16.35]I'll be fine.
[08:18.29]I gotta go this way.
[08:21.93]This is like a big piece of lint or cotton or something in my drink.
[08:35.64]Here we go.
[08:36.24]No, not quite.
[08:38.84]I want to go do this because I couldn't do it before and I'm one of those people where I will absolutely not do it at all.
[08:45.71]I'll skip this whole thing and we'll skip a whole boss and I'll be very upset about it in the long run.
[08:53.94]No, it's definitely not my hair this time.
[08:55.80]Not this time.
[09:03.01]This is the first boss.
[09:04.95]Yeah, remember when I came here, though?
[09:06.87]When I came here last time?
[09:09.21]I couldn't even hurt the guy.
[09:15.79]Well, we got... 50 bucks just came in.
[09:19.62]From... Who just gave $50...
[09:23.02]Callie Brady just gave 50 bucks.
[09:26.12]And they say, hey, Jerma, good luck with your move to Nevada.
[09:28.56]Nevada.
[09:29.74]Get it right, Jeremy.
[09:31.35]Love your work and hope it all works out.
[09:34.33]Just short, sweet message.
[09:36.33]Thanks a lot, man.
[09:38.27]Thank you so much for the $50.
[09:39.11]I'm looking forward to the move myself.
[09:44.68]Much appreciated, though.
[09:46.02]Callie Brady.
[09:46.48]Hold on, hold on.
[09:52.76]I don't even need to fight these guys.
[09:54.14]I just want to run and do the boss.
[10:00.28]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[10:04.46]Why do I have this stupid curse on?
[10:07.69]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[10:09.77]Jesus Christ.
[10:17.17]Why am I leaving New Jersey?
[10:18.37]I don't live in New Jersey.
[10:22.97]Is there even a bonfire here or am I going to screw myself?
[10:27.98]I don't remember.
[10:28.38]Is there one down here?
[10:29.12]Or does this one just not work?
[10:40.14]It's always the shittiest enemies that give me trouble.
[10:42.24]Especially when I first start back up.
[10:45.41]There's a bonfire right here, right?
[10:48.55]Eh, okay, good.
[10:50.49]Alright, let's try to kill this thing.
[10:53.30]This thing's not kindled, but we'll see if I even need it.
[10:56.06]I might not even need it.
[10:59.78]Let's see if I can beat this thing.
[11:02.46]Stray Demon, let's go.
[11:05.19]I'm ready.
[11:05.55]I had my vitamins this morning.
[11:12.49]Alright, so he blows up the world.
[11:14.65]Yeah, I can hurt him now.
[11:20.93]Couldn't hurt him before.
[11:25.99]I think when he does that... Alright, so when he puts his hands in the air and turns it around, you get yourself a... He has a braze.
[11:36.68]Just be quiet, Jeremy, and just beat him.
[11:39.47]He's going to do it again.
[11:40.07]There he goes, the big stomp.
[11:51.90]His hands and his weapon's on a hitbox.
[11:54.75]Who designed this game?
[11:57.29]Ooh, that hurts.
[12:02.76]Alright, so he doesn't really swing.
[12:03.90]He just puts these little bombs.
[12:08.86]Okay, I get it.
[12:17.75]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!
[12:21.31]Okay, we're good.
[12:25.47]There he goes again.
[12:26.01]So now that I can actually hurt him, this is not too bad, actually, at all.
[12:36.08]Is he going to do it?
[12:36.54]Where are you going?
[12:37.02]Uh-oh.
[12:39.42]New move?
[12:42.16]Ooh, not really.
[12:44.20]Good thing I wasn't in the center of that.
[12:45.42]I'm going to do it again.
[12:55.61]Should be able to kill him.
[12:56.71]No, don't get greedy.
[13:02.81]So what do I get for doing this?
[13:07.70]Three, two, one, see you later.
[13:10.58]Okay.
[13:10.68]We're cleaning the bosses up.
[13:14.16]Victory achieved, pick up item.
[13:15.52]That's a tight knight slab.
[13:17.98]Good.
[13:18.96]Humanity, homeward bone, and how many souls?
[13:24.28]So now I can get this thing to plus 15.
[13:30.45]I should probably... Alright, let me ask you something.
[13:34.75]There are only... Anything else I can do down here?
[13:38.01]Like every other Souls game, I'm assuming there's only like one or two Titanite Slabs in the whole game, right?
[13:46.45]So... Am I gonna have a plus 15 Butcher?
[13:53.14]I think that's what's going to happen.
[13:56.62]There are a few more in the DLC.
[13:57.80]Okay, so I'm going to get this to plus 15.
[14:01.46]Nothing else here.
[14:03.72]Okay, just making sure I didn't miss anything.
[14:05.08]What about like an illusory wall or anything?
[14:08.12]No connection to another world?
[14:09.76]Don't think so.
[14:12.80]So there's like four in total.
[14:13.80]Okay.
[14:19.83]The butcher goes to S. That's pretty great then.
[14:23.99]This puts me here.
[14:24.99]So this has been destroyed, so let me take a look around for a second.
[14:31.92]I'm not going to farm dark wraiths.
[14:35.08]I definitely am not going to farm dark wraiths.
[14:38.07]I don't even know what that is.
[14:38.89]Let's take one more little gander.
[14:49.37]I do have a Black Knight weapon.
[14:50.79]Remember, I got it accidentally.
[14:52.01]The guy walked off the cliff and I got the halberd.
[14:54.53]I don't want to use that, though.
[14:55.47]I think... Because that's a... Isn't that one of those weapons... That just turns the game into the easiest game ever.
[15:03.74]Can't open that.
[15:06.50]And plus, I don't have enough decks for it anyways.
[15:08.12]Alright, I was already here.
[15:09.46]I did all this anyways.
[15:10.56]I just didn't kill the boss, so... Let's get out of here.
[15:16.30]I'd rather my first playthrough of this game be not the snooze mode where I can kill a boss in like two swings.
[15:35.44]Alright, let's get out of here.
[15:37.54]Let's get out of here.
[15:38.18]And I did, I'll tell you, I did do a few things.
[15:40.92]I told you I was going to do the soft stream.
[15:43.78]I got the thing where you can reinforce at a bonfire.
[15:46.84]I got the thing where I can keep... There was a lot of advice in the last stream.
[15:54.56]And I took it very, very much to heart.
[15:58.06]I prepared this time that I'm ready to go.
[16:03.15]I bought some things that I needed.
[16:04.73]I did a little bit of cleanup.
[16:07.37]So now we're going to be ready to go.
[16:12.92]Ugh.
[16:14.14]Paid cheats.
[16:15.38]No, it's called advice from viewers that are giving me advice.
[16:20.08]So here's the deal.
[16:21.68]We are going to plus 15.
[16:24.18]It does not go to S scaling.
[16:30.95]Although, can I get it to go to S scaling?
[16:34.27]Plus 15.
[16:34.63]The Titanite Slab.
[16:42.86]I'm cheating in a game.
[16:43.82]Are you still drinking the poison coffee?
[16:50.98]Yeah, I paid for it.
[16:52.34]I'm just going to do it.
[16:59.01]Fuck it.
[17:02.27]Plus 14?
[17:03.81]Do overleveled?
[17:04.73]Well, we're not here.
[17:06.03]I currently am supposed to be going... At this point, I'm supposed to be in... What is it?
[17:10.25]The Duke's Archives is where I'm supposed to be.
[17:12.85]That's what somebody told me.
[17:13.63]That's, like, where I am now.
[17:20.66]Or Izalith.
[17:21.24]Yeah.
[17:21.50]So, like, I'm, like, near the end of the game.
[17:23.64]So... Plus 15, butcher knife.
[17:27.06]I don't give a shit.
[17:27.54]We're doing it.
[17:33.99]We're doing it.
[17:34.39]We're just doing it.
[17:37.77]Besides the DLC.
[17:38.34]Alright, let's see here.
[17:45.04]Am I overleveled?
[17:45.68]I'm only so level 70.
[17:47.80]That's overleveled?
[17:50.77]I guess... I don't think that.
[17:53.91]I don't think that's correct.
[17:54.85]But whatever.
[17:55.37]We're going to go to... First thing that I actually need to do... I need to go...
[18:01.66]Because I can't fight that boss that's inside of New Londo.
[18:11.79]So now I... Clean it up.
[18:15.79]There's one more thing I think I have to do before we keep going.
[18:17.65]Alright, so from here, there was one place I didn't go.
[18:38.04]If you do the DLC any later, it'll be too easy.
[18:43.18]He's still in Anor Londo.
[18:44.64]There he is.
[18:49.29]Oh, God.
[18:49.71]This guy can't even fucking leave Anor Londo.
[18:52.57]This guy sucks.
[18:53.85]Alright.
[18:56.45]Where do I need to go from here?
[18:57.63]This place is sprawling and large.
[19:00.17]I'm certain that over there is the next area.
[19:03.45]That's where it is.
[19:04.23]I'm certain of this.
[19:10.11]It's almost like this is a main connecting area.
[19:15.09]I could go there right now, but I don't want to just skip a bunch of shit.
[19:18.58]I'd rather see it, right?
[19:24.76]Please get my UTI treated.
[19:26.50]What the fuck are you talking about?
[19:29.57]What are you talking about?
[19:34.92]What do you mean he looked it up?
[19:36.23]No, I took a while reading and watching.
[19:39.49]I was watching and reading things people were saying.
[19:42.09]I went back to the VODs.
[19:43.97]I went into the Discord and I was lurking the fuck out of you guys and I was seeing what people were saying about me.
[19:49.32]There were a lot of things that I was embarrassed.
[19:52.77]I was scared.
[20:04.08]Look, just because I wanted to make sure I knew where I was supposed to go.
[20:09.54]Did you see the last stream?
[20:10.96]Will you hear the last stream?
[20:12.48]Did you see what happened to me?
[20:14.60]I turned into a fucking goblin last stream.
[20:17.32]I don't want that to happen again.
[20:22.16]Not like last Dark Souls stream.
[20:24.36]I turned into a little mutant.
[20:27.92]I don't want to turn into a mutant again.
[20:29.20]Alright, so from here.
[20:35.02]I actually don't know what you guys are talking about here.
[20:38.14]So there's a boss here that I need to fight.
[20:40.52]But where is it?
[20:45.01]I'm trying to remember where that would even be.
[20:49.89]I'm showing my true colors.
[20:53.09]Go into the painting.
[20:57.95]You gotta kill the lady.
[21:05.00]I'm not going into the painting.
[21:10.44]Alright, so where was the lady?
[21:12.21]No, I'm not going into the fucking painting.
[21:21.71]She has her own bonfire.
[21:25.10]Chamber of the Princess.
[21:26.18]I'm going to assume that's where it is.
[21:35.14]And this is correct.
[21:37.32]There she is.
[21:38.92]Alright, so let's, uh... I have a lot of souls, though.
[21:41.10]I don't know if I like this.
[21:43.95]How much is it to get?
[21:44.63]Uh, to level up once?
[21:47.61]Not very much at all.
[21:48.89]I need to do this one more time.
[21:49.87]I gotta level up before I go fight a boss.
[21:53.57]Let me just kill a few things.
[21:55.07]I still have a soul, don't I?
[21:58.67]No.
[21:59.15]I don't want to break that.
[22:00.23]Because I want to just see what it is.
[22:01.57]Pfft.
[22:06.47]Alright, well, whatever.
[22:07.23]So you're telling me I have to kill this lady?
[22:12.21]How?
[22:12.65]I can't reach her.
[22:17.25]I can't reach her.
[22:18.13]Am I supposed to hit her on her fucking confetti?
[22:20.43]This isn't going to do anything.
[22:23.56]I'm going to throw a knife at her?
[22:24.68]Oh, chosen undead.
[22:33.16]Thou.
[22:36.04]Let's talk.
[22:36.88]He's reading the one guy again.
[22:46.16]Okay, well.
[22:53.00]Knife, knife, knife.
[22:55.90]Let's take a look at some item descriptions.
[22:58.10]Like people were telling me to do.
[22:59.64]Here's the great soul of Lord Neato.
[23:03.71]Right of kindling.
[23:04.57]A weird little doll.
[23:08.07]Already bought this because I cheated and you've all figured it out by now.
[23:11.61]So I don't, doesn't matter that somebody told me to get this.
[23:15.75]It doesn't matter.
[23:16.43]I was going to try to pretend that I'm going to buy it.
[23:18.55]I was going to go to a BRB screen and buy it and then come back and be like, oh, I'm supposed to buy this.
[23:23.39]But I failed.
[23:24.27]And you see it now.
[23:25.07]So I fucked up and you know that I cheated.
[23:27.19]But let's get over it because it's over.
[23:28.47]Alright, big pilgrim's key.
[23:35.69]I was gonna sit down and be like, oh, I gotta piss, be right back.
[23:38.01]And then like come back and be at that screen and be like, oh, I gotta get this.
[23:40.26]What's this?
[23:42.00]Somebody told me to do it.
[23:42.94]And they told me I was gonna save me like two hours of time.
[23:45.86]How was I ever supposed to know to buy that?
[23:47.40]Nobody would have told me unless I read the item descriptions.
[23:49.60]And there's a lot of those item descriptions that I didn't read.
[23:53.16]Let's see.
[23:55.28]Oh, let's take a look at some of the rings.
[23:58.96]That can't be how it happened.
[24:01.84]Ring of sacrifice.
[24:02.84]Can I put a ring on?
[24:07.20]Wait a minute.
[24:14.29]The Dark Sun Gwyndolin is the only remaining deity in Anor Londo.
[24:17.67]His followers are few, but their tasks are of vital importance.
[24:21.87]Can I put this ring on?
[24:26.05]Good actor.
[24:28.10]Top tier acting, by the way, with, wait a minute!
[24:31.38]Alright, I'm gonna put on the seance ring.
[24:36.45]Wait a... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[24:37.87]That is a real wait a minute because I don't want to... I don't want to replace this.
[24:44.69]Wait a minute.
[24:45.11]Oh, chosen undead.
[24:56.16]I have it on.
[24:58.20]Father's role thou should assume and thou shalt end it this eternal twilight.
[25:03.88]The primordial
[25:08.50]I have to kill her.
[25:09.33]So why is everybody telling me I'm killing her?
[25:11.51]Fuck it.
[25:12.59]Who cares?
[25:13.97]We're almost done with the game anyways.
[25:15.49]I got another 17 hours of gameplay left.
[25:17.75]It's not a big deal.
[25:25.22]How could you?
[25:26.22]What are you talking about, how could you?
[25:29.80]I didn't read enough guides.
[25:39.52]Don't go downstairs.
[25:40.80]Don't do it.
[25:41.58]Okay.
[25:42.10]You know what?
[25:42.60]I have a better idea.
[25:44.07]I'm too fucking scared to do this because I don't know what it's going to do and everyone's trying to get me to do two things.
[25:48.41]Three things at the same time.
[25:49.43]So here's what we're going to do.
[25:50.85]We're just simply going to go to where I need to go.
[25:54.39]I'll come back to this.
[25:55.77]I don't like how I'm being treated here with this chat room telling me to do shit.
[25:59.82]I don't know what to do.
[26:03.02]I'm going to come back and make a decision in another few minutes.
[26:10.45]No, no, I can't.
[26:13.49]Fucking Dark Souls, man.
[26:14.63]Why can't it just be like, go to level two?
[26:19.02]Why can't it just be, go to level two?
[26:21.24]You know?
[26:24.24]Leave that one on.
[26:24.82]Absorbs HP.
[26:26.46]Stamina recovery.
[26:27.68]More max equipment load.
[26:29.88]Let's have super recovery.
[26:33.67]I know what I need to do.
[26:35.51]And that is very, very simply I have to go back down and open this door.
[26:43.37]We can come back here.
[26:55.19]I need to grow some balls.
[26:57.81]Come on, man.
[26:59.93]You know how tough it is to stream this game with 50,000 people watching?
[27:05.27]This is probably a whole country's worth of people here.
[27:11.69]Look at this entire country worth of people.
[27:14.59]Actually, hold on a second.
[27:17.33]Like 2,000 people.
[27:17.81]That's like at least... Let me see here.
[27:21.96]Can I do anything else with my... No.
[27:25.34]I got a plus 15 butcher knife.
[27:27.04]That's all I can do.
[27:27.68]I can't do anything else to it.
[27:30.76]I don't have any more dragon skills, so I can't do anything with that.
[27:36.12]This too... Yeah, guys, there are 2,000 people that live in the Vatican.
[27:39.24]Come on, it's like a whole country.
[27:42.81]Another $50 coming in here from 3tsluke.
[27:46.62]Thank you so much for the $50, Luke.
[27:50.32]Big bits.
[27:52.80]Thanks so much, man.
[27:54.74]I realize it's not a lot, but I wanted to give something considering how much I watch.
[27:57.92]Also, ignore chat.
[27:59.02]That's a lot.
[27:59.92]That is a lot.
[28:02.02]Don't ever think that giving me $50 is not a lot of money.
[28:06.26]That's a huge amount of money.
[28:12.92]Thank you so much, man.
[28:18.41]I'm going to take his $50 advice.
[28:20.79]You got it.
[28:21.11]I'm going to ignore chat.
[28:24.93]In fact, let's... No, I'm not going to do that.
[28:28.31]We're keeping sub chat off.
[28:30.74]I'm not doing that.
[28:35.48]Thanks, 3TS.
[28:36.48]Thanks so much, man.
[28:37.84]It means a lot.
[28:39.74]Don't ever feel like $50 is not enough money for me.
[28:50.67]$50?
[28:50.71]That's like 2,000 people.
[28:52.33]Holy shit.
[28:53.77]What's going on?
[28:54.71]Oh, great.
[28:55.17]I have to... Don't back off and lose these.
[28:57.18]Alright.
[29:01.26]Still not enough.
[29:03.38]I really want to get rid of these souls before I go and fight a boss that I've never seen.
[29:06.51]Oh god.
[29:06.69]Ah!
[29:06.89]I need 3,000 souls.
[29:07.37]God damn it.
[29:14.79]Be better at the game and earn our loyalty?
[29:17.04]Come on!
[29:17.38]I beat Ornstein and Smoeg in like five tries!
[29:20.00]First time!
[29:20.76]That doesn't earn any loyalty points with you guys.
[29:22.68]I can't scan my loyalty card.
[29:29.92]Six tries.
[29:30.60]Well, whatever.
[29:31.21]It was still less than ten.
[29:37.29]Five tries.
[29:38.41]First time.
[29:39.29]I'm gonna get to 29,000.
[29:39.83]I'm not gonna lose 29,000 souls.
[29:42.11]Just kill one of these big guys.
[29:50.59]Come on, when can I get the hits on him?
[29:55.21]Imagine you woke up just to die.
[29:59.61]Oh, what a good nap that was.
[30:01.44]You don't even know you woke up.
[30:07.94]Come on, some more.
[30:09.62]Just give me another couple so I can get to 29,000.
[30:11.46]Remember how much of a pain in the ass this was when I first came here?
[30:21.47]That's the beauty of Dark Souls, though.
[30:22.67]You just feel so much stronger.
[30:24.27]I'm so glad the enemies don't scale in these games.
[30:26.51]You know how much that would suck?
[30:35.28]Nobody else?
[30:35.80]Come on.
[30:36.06]What are these little tree bush things?
[30:41.98]I need to kill one or two more of these guys.
[30:44.74]I'm going to go refresh them.
[30:51.49]One reason why I think this Dark Souls 1 is a great game.
[30:56.63]There's no poison swamp in this game.
[30:59.45]Besides, well, you could say that Blighttown is a poison swamp, but it's not, not really.
[31:06.53]That's not, but no, not really.
[31:07.91]Like, there's no poison swamp that you have to actually stay in.
[31:11.27]You just like walk through it once.
[31:14.15]That poison swamp in Blighttown is not, you're not like knee-deep in poison for the whole level.
[31:19.00]You just like walk across it once or twice.
[31:28.69]That's enough for me to be very happy with this game.
[31:31.51]Okay, two more kills.
[31:32.39]I'm sorry this is taking forever, but... Literally, I know it's a poison swamp, but it's not the poison swamp that I'm referring to.
[31:44.38]I'm referring to knee-deep in water for the whole level.
[31:50.97]And it's enough to make you go insane.
[31:55.07]The poison swamp is not the issue with Blighttown.
[31:57.07]It's Blighttown is the issue with Blighttown.
[32:01.31]Come on, one more.
[32:08.04]Yeah, I'm still in the forest.
[32:09.24]Almost done.
[32:12.02]The rapid fire toxic guys?
[32:13.26]Yeah, but that's an enemy.
[32:14.52]That's not like the area.
[32:16.34]Oh, shit.
[32:16.68]Is that enough?
[32:20.57]Just to be sure, I'm going to kill this guy too.
[32:22.99]So I'm not going to have to do this again.
[32:34.12]Alright, we got it.
[32:36.02]Time to go.
[32:39.59]Goodbye.
[32:53.31]Mm-hmm.
[32:54.61]Let's go rest in the bonfire.
[32:55.83]Level up once.
[32:57.79]And then let's put this thing inside of there.
[33:00.87]Well, not yet.
[33:04.57]They're backing off.
[33:07.72]Alright, level up.
[33:08.70]Let's do it to vitality.
[33:11.50]Just to do it.
[33:13.84]Should I get to 40 endurance?
[33:16.92]That's the actual cap, isn't it?
[33:18.04]Alright, I'm ready.
[33:26.04]Let's go put the thing in that I, before the stream, cheated to make sure I was not going to have a terrible walk around aimlessly stream.
[33:31.66]But here's the thing, though.
[33:32.44]Like...
[33:34.04]What I have actually... We're talking about me.
[33:36.70]We're not talking about other people.
[33:37.88]We're talking about me.
[33:39.12]Would I have figured that out?
[33:40.50]That I needed to buy that from Harold?
[33:43.08]Probably not.
[33:50.87]Okay, this is a new area.
[33:53.83]This is where I'm supposed to be right now, I believe.
[33:57.59]Let's take a look around.
[34:05.28]Oh, a cliff.
[34:08.06]There's a light over here.
[34:08.92]Oh, it's just one of those light flowers.
[34:12.40]Hold on.
[34:13.62]Somebody died.
[34:14.44]No?
[34:14.90]Okay, that hurt.
[34:16.14]Who the fuck is this guy?
[34:17.20]Alright, there are randomly knights here.
[34:18.49]Get out of my fucking way.
[34:27.63]Holy shit, that guy's still alive.
[34:33.79]No, don't do it.
[34:34.41]I ducked underneath that.
[34:35.29]How the hell was that possible?
[34:36.31]Okay, he's done.
[34:37.80]Alright.
[34:47.75]Two ghost people?
[34:49.53]Are these guys ghosts?
[34:50.21]I don't know, but I'm going to look around.
[34:59.30]The way to go over here.
[35:04.15]item that way.
[35:05.05]Let's go get it.
[35:07.74]Why not, right?
[35:10.36]That was a one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people leader.
[35:15.40]Just got it.
[35:21.64]Ow.
[35:28.77]Great reference.
[35:30.75]I don't know if anyone was going to get that reference.
[35:32.69]That's an old reference.
[35:35.95]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[35:37.35]Don't, easy now.
[35:38.17]There's a lot of people here.
[35:49.58]Really?
[35:52.98]Really, part two?
[35:53.66]Alright.
[35:57.94]Am I going to do DLC stream?
[35:59.92]I plan on doing it all.
[36:01.86]We're going to do it all.
[36:03.68]Eastern Helm, Eastern Armor.
[36:05.66]Okay, cool.
[36:08.16]There's a bunch of snakes down there.
[36:11.10]Alright.
[36:16.89]Is that the boss?
[36:18.77]Do I have to maybe get all the way down there?
[36:23.19]Hold on, not yet.
[36:24.41]I don't want to just run through.
[36:25.47]There's probably more to see.
[36:42.18]Nothing at this bright light.
[36:44.00]We're kind of just walking around in circles now.
[36:54.34]Oh, that's not good.
[36:55.43]Oh, that's not good.
[37:00.75]Oh, there's another guy here.
[37:01.55]Are you just stuck like this?
[37:07.81]Is this a free kill?
[37:09.57]Looked like it.
[37:16.63]Oh, fuck you, dude.
[37:18.53]I gotta get away from the tree.
[37:19.93]It's causing a problem here.
[37:32.62]This is just a standard enemy, huh?
[37:36.73]I didn't go over here, so I might as well...
[37:44.41]Don't even give him a chance.
[37:45.93]Oh, really?
[37:49.07]Get... What the fuck was that?
[37:51.74]Come on!
[37:52.18]These guys probably have a chance to draw... Oh, there it is.
[38:00.42]Blackbow of Faris.
[38:01.50]Faris's hat.
[38:07.93]Interesting.
[38:10.13]Where is it?
[38:13.60]Mask of the Mother.
[38:14.50]I think I need to do some changes here.
[38:19.48]Should I be like weird Robin Hood?
[38:22.45]Broad-brimmed hat favored by the archer hero Faris.
[38:25.17]Faris was an accomplished archer.
[38:27.15]And though he was human, he ranked alongside Hawkeye.
[38:30.99]One of the four knights... Wait, hold on.
[38:33.55]Is this the Avengers?
[38:35.63]Are the four knights the Avengers?
[38:37.25]The four kings?
[38:40.73]It's very popular among children.
[38:42.77]Okay.
[38:45.95]Doesn't really, this thing kind of sucks though.
[38:51.81]Why am I getting ha-has for that?
[38:53.59]I'm just making a reference to the Marvel Universe.
[39:00.68]I kind of like this.
[39:05.80]I just said like Hawkeye is in the Avengers and all of a sudden people are like telling me ha-ha?
[39:11.41]Is that it?
[39:11.89]Is that all it takes?
[39:15.55]Read the description.
[39:16.55]Fucking goddammit, I pressed the wrong button.
[39:18.17]Let's read the description of this one.
[39:24.05]One of the three masks is a pinwheel.
[39:26.09]This mask, belonging to the Kindly Mother, slightly raises your HP.
[39:29.41]That's actually really cool.
[39:33.68]That's very cool, actually.
[39:35.32]Nice.
[39:35.66]Alright, I'll keep it on.
[39:45.39]I didn't go over here.
[39:48.79]One could get lost down here.
[39:50.43]I will say.
[40:00.15]More... Okay, this is a little area I haven't been.
[40:02.98]Alright, well.
[40:09.54]Good thing it's one at a time here.
[40:12.18]Who are these people?
[40:14.63]This is the first time in a while we've seen just people are the enemies.
[40:17.92]Just the default enemies are people.
[40:22.98]These are all like starting characters.
[40:24.70]Am I in like the noob zone?
[40:25.90]Did I just get fucking backstabbed?
[40:36.25]Oh, fuck this guy.
[40:43.97]I'm going to crush this dude.
[40:51.36]See you later.
[40:52.70]Okay.
[40:53.04]Are these guys all non-holos in the tutorial zone?
[40:59.78]I'm definitely making progress because this is probably the way I need to go.
[41:16.55]Nothing else over there?
[41:17.39]I mean, is there?
[41:17.97]Not really.
[41:19.88]Let's just go in here because it's here.
[41:22.18]Bonfire.
[41:24.86]Talk.
[41:25.84]Talk to what?
[41:31.45]What is this thing?
[41:33.11]Thou fared well to find me.
[41:35.27]But cometh thee not for the grave of Sir Artorias.
[41:38.41]This is the best character in the game.
[41:39.59]My advice true.
[41:41.86]Forget this.
[41:42.88]Alice in Wonderland.
[41:43.72]The legend of Artorias are none but a fabrication.
[41:48.50]Traversing the dark.
[41:51.52]It is but a fairy tale.
[41:53.37]Have thine own respect.
[41:55.49]Go not yonder knocking for nothing.
[41:57.61]Beanbag Sonic, but without the Sonic.
[42:00.01]Wait, what?
[42:01.51]That was a fucking Alice in Wonderland riddle.
[42:03.62]I think I'm going to have to say yes to this lady.
[42:14.76]Maybe I can be in the fat, overfed cat covenants.
[42:21.01]I feel like this is a while you're in the line at a Universal Studios ride you cross by this and she repeats this a hundred times
[42:53.79]This is just like the, I'm going to tell you the story while you walk by to get on the roller coaster.
[42:59.85]Yeah, let's do it.
[43:10.02]So it is a covenant.
[43:12.20]Join the covenant of the animatronic roller coaster line queue overfed cats.
[43:20.37]Yes.
[43:29.07]I got a ring!
[43:32.40]Cat covenant ring.
[43:33.48]So this is where you defend your zone.
[43:36.00]Alright, so now hold R2 and cut off head.
[43:52.10]See, he's definitely sitting on eggs.
[43:54.24]No, don't take my eggs!
[43:55.78]Oh, goddammit.
[43:57.89]So you can't leave this covenant, is that what she's saying?
[44:03.59]Can I buy things from her?
[44:22.30]My hopes for thee are of the highest.
[44:27.58]There's no covenant thing I can do with her?
[44:29.53]There's nothing I can do?
[44:30.31]Okay, well.
[44:33.13]Let's see what that ring is.
[44:34.99]Cat Covenant Ring.
[44:35.93]It's a very pretty ring.
[44:38.29]Answer the summoning.
[44:40.41]Ring granted to those bound by the Forest Hunter Covenant.
[44:43.31]Answer Alvina's summoning.
[44:44.65]The white cat, Alvina, speaks a human tongue and has lived since the early age of fire.
[44:48.63]Alvina was a trusted friend of Knight Artorias.
[44:51.52]And the Great Wolf, Sif.
[44:53.34]So it's just a PvP ring, okay.
[44:57.58]PvP ring, that's cool.
[45:00.02]Alright, well, where's your cat bonfire?
[45:02.00]Alright, there's more.
[45:14.25]There's more, hold on.

[45:41.50]There's a new guy.
[45:42.14]New guy.
[45:42.46]Is this guy hostile?
[45:46.33]He's not.
[45:47.87]Where did this guy come from?
[45:49.23]I've heard all about you.
[45:50.81]I'm Shiva of the East, captain of the brigade.
[45:54.27]Let's teach you the clan basics now.
[45:56.17]Wait, what?
[45:56.91]As there's no time to chat in the midst of fighting.
[45:59.39]Oh, now I'm one of their friends.
[46:00.67]There is little in the form of rules, you hear?
[46:04.37]Fight and hunt as you like.
[46:07.65]Whoever's fastest gets the prey.
[46:10.77]That's the way we do it.
[46:12.70]I think it's cool, that sword.
[46:14.30]Don't forget what Alvina said.
[46:18.02]Traitors aren't given a second chance.
[46:20.96]So what does that mean?
[46:21.65]That means I'm just going to get hunted?
[46:23.13]That's about it then.
[46:24.65]Don't worry.
[46:26.07]It's a good old time, isn't it?
[46:27.99]Great to have you with us.
[46:29.87]Good hunting.
[46:31.45]Job application.
[46:32.49]Alright.
[46:33.07]So.
[46:35.41]Don't worry.
[46:35.95]You'll be called in hunters.
[46:38.63]That's it.
[46:39.95]Nothing else?
[46:40.99]Don't worry.
[46:42.18]What about the guy back here?
[46:46.75]Nothing out of you Backstab the guy Well, okay, thanks guys, thanks for the tip bye Anything else?
[47:06.45]Oh, what's that?
[47:10.97]Can I am I What if I get shit on?
[47:15.90]That is a perfect, like, cat butthole right there.
[47:18.40]How do I get that?
[47:20.70]Can I fall off?
[47:27.64]Can I just roll off this?
[47:31.31]Can I... No.
[47:34.53]Shit.
[47:35.03]I guess I can go around, then.
[47:37.17]I'm gonna go around the back.
[47:44.74]What did I say?
[47:45.30]I talked about how the cat was going to shit on me.
[47:51.14]There we go.
[47:54.86]Are you one of those creatures?
[47:56.28]No, you're not.
[47:59.22]Stone helm, stone armor, stone gauntlets.
[48:03.66]Stone.
[48:06.80]Stone helm.
[48:08.85]Holy shit.
[48:10.75]Moss-covered helm with a stone knight.
[48:12.93]The stone knight is a product of ancient magic, and although this helm is also imbued with magic, it is incredibly heavy.
[48:20.64]Equipment load.
[48:21.28]I think that'll be too much.
[48:22.98]Although, if I put it on Havel's ring... Let me see.
[48:31.54]Maybe I can put, like, the pants on.
[48:33.70]Stone leggings.
[48:34.64]48.
[48:34.70]I can put these on.
[48:38.55]Jesus, that's a lot of defense.
[48:40.01]Alright.
[48:41.87]Put those on.
[48:44.31]Katarina.
[48:44.93]What's better?
[48:47.29]Stoneman.
[48:50.49]54.
[48:51.05]I can still do it.
[48:54.64]So much more poise, too.
[48:55.66]Okay, what am I at for 54 or 135?
[49:02.18]I can do another one.
[49:03.08]I like the mask.
[49:03.94]I want to keep the mask on, I think.
[49:15.17]That extra HP.
[49:15.89]How much x-ray am I still?
[49:17.67]No, I'm good.
[49:18.13]I mean, you just kind of look dirty.
[49:26.25]I mean, that's... If I take that mask off, will you die?
[49:32.69]Well, I'm not sure, but it would be extremely... I'm sorry.
[49:39.14]Nobody's didn't know.
[49:39.78]You guys were being good, and I did it anyways.
[49:42.42]I'm sorry.
[49:46.12]We'll keep the mask on for now.
[49:48.22]But I'm still mid-rolling.
[49:50.94]Oh, back to the mushroom people.
[49:52.10]Okay.
[49:54.19]I need to find... Hold on, there's like a little trail over there?
[49:56.67]Nah, I only take out the Bane voice when people are bad.
[50:04.23]Alright, watch out.
[50:08.26]I'm gonna hug this right wall.
[50:09.92]Right cliff.
[50:11.88]I ain't gonna get fucking killed here.
[50:20.15]Looking for some kind of shortcut or some kind of... Okay, there's a ladder right there.
[50:24.28]That goes down.
[50:28.28]Hold on.
[50:31.26]Hmm.
[50:35.44]I don't want to fuck with these guys.
[50:37.94]Items.
[50:38.52]This place is big.
[50:43.02]Big.
[50:46.49]Anyone else?
[50:47.21]No, no.
[50:48.13]I think there's a boss over here.
[50:50.33]Right there, but I need to find a shortcut.
[51:01.96]That is absolutely a boss door, so... What's the quickest way to get back from here?
[51:07.98]Let me see.
[51:15.71]I'm just going to walk around.
[51:16.65]There was that ladder over there.
[51:18.21]Hold on.
[51:25.30]With these large open areas, these maze-like gigantic trees, let me just look around in a circle.
[51:36.78]I don't want to miss much.
[51:37.54]I don't want to get to a point where I go, oh, what?
[51:43.72]I can't believe it.
[51:45.56]I missed it.
[51:47.24]Alright.
[51:47.49]Well, obviously I didn't miss anything.
[51:48.77]So I'm going to go to the ladder, which was over here.
[51:58.19]Because I ain't going to just drop down.
[52:06.38]And you got, well, there's a chest.
[52:07.36]See, this is why you got, there's a chest right there.
[52:09.22]Just hold on.
[52:14.21]These guys freak me out, and I know they're not even that strong, but they're still scary.
[52:18.51]Yeah, and they are very strong, actually.
[52:19.95]Why would I... Don't underestimate these guys.
[52:30.79]They're just really slow.
[52:31.69]Okay.
[52:37.92]He dropped something.
[52:40.94]Gold pine resin.
[52:42.16]Very useful.
[52:45.89]That is not a mimic, so it's just kind of a chest that's here.
[52:53.07]Can I fucking parry these guys?
[52:54.25]I don't think so.
[52:58.05]Can they be backstabbed?
[52:59.75]Everybody can be backstabbed.
[53:04.34]No, can they?
[53:07.04]Maybe not.
[53:11.22]Well, that's actually pretty easy just to not... Oh, no, it's not.

[53:57.47]Those are adults.
[53:58.15]Alright, there's the ladder.
[54:02.37]How do I get down there?
[54:03.65]I guess... I don't know.
[54:06.55]Fuck me, I don't know what the hell to do there.
[54:08.01]Okay, hold on.
[54:10.03]If I come down here, am I gonna regret this?

[54:51.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:53.41]Where does this go?
[54:58.42]This goes around.
[54:59.28]So there's like a little slot right here that you go through.
[55:05.04]You can miss it.
[55:05.70]It's really easy to miss.
[55:06.68]So don't miss it.
[55:11.04]So let's just turn from here.
[55:15.01]Ow, fuck you.
[55:17.23]Really, you fucking dick.
[55:22.45]Let me just see what this is.
[55:23.87]So if I go straight from here, does this lead me back out somewhere?
[55:31.97]Okay, this... Straight from there, past that swamp.
[55:36.22]The swamp zone has to be on the left.
[55:45.16]Huh.
[55:47.30]Well, I sure am getting lost.
[55:52.52]Well, there's a good view over here.
[55:53.62]I might as well see it.
[55:54.38]Fuck.
[56:03.96]At least I know that's how you can get back to there.
[56:09.83]Let me go back here and look.
[56:12.81]I'm not even sure if I'm in a new area or if this is just an old one.
[56:16.55]I need to find a point of interest that I recognize.
[56:20.01]Alright, hold on.
[56:22.64]Point of interest.
[56:23.54]This is where the cat was, right?
[56:27.38]It is, isn't it?
[56:27.88]Alright, where's the cat?
[56:32.99]Oh, no.
[56:33.61]Oh, yo, yo, yo.
[56:34.87]Hey, yo.
[56:35.65]There it is.
[56:36.17]Alright.
[56:37.55]So we just have to go straight down and around.
[56:40.42]Bonfire.
[56:41.66]Nice.
[56:42.00]Okay.
[56:43.56]Hey, yo.
[56:44.10]Hey, yo.
[56:44.98]I feel like I should kindle this.
[56:49.82]Not even a shortcut.
[56:51.76]But now I know I can go straight there.
[56:54.04]And walk around.
[56:56.62]Yo, I'm walking here.
[56:58.44]I'm going to kindle this.
[57:03.92]Let's kindle it.
[57:05.04]So I can get plus 10.
[57:09.54]Use two of these humanities.
[57:11.30]Not 20.
[57:13.08]I'm going to do that one day, man.
[57:14.38]And it's going to be a disaster.
[57:24.77]Universe Hollowing, and then Kindle.
[57:30.22]That's going to happen, and that's going to be a spike my controller into the ground moment.
[57:41.92]Can Kindle it twice?
[57:43.41]Do I want to, though?
[57:44.53]Do I really?
[57:48.07]I mean, might as well.
[57:49.17]I can warp to this and just get it right.
[57:51.59]Can I?
[57:52.09]No, I can't warp to this one.
[57:56.30]No, I'm not doing that to this one.
[57:58.06]We're fine as we are.
[57:58.90]Alright, I still can't level up.
[58:00.32]Yeah, if you can't warp to it, there's no point, right?
[58:06.54]I don't have any other souls, so I have to just walk around with these... Fucking 22,000 souls, which I don't necessarily like, but we're gonna have to do it anyway.
[58:14.57]So, let's go back to what we were doing through the front door.
[58:18.05]And then find that little crevice to walk down again.
[58:22.73]Oh shit, these guys are alive again.
[58:24.03]Oh well.
[58:27.01]I think it was this way, right?
[58:31.77]Over here.
[58:33.15]I don't think I need to fight them.
[58:33.95]I think I can just walk by them.
[58:36.29]Alright, look at the crevice.
[58:39.07]Where's that crevice?
[58:40.33]Not there.
[58:47.68]It's over here.
[58:48.28]Okay, keep going.
[58:50.94]Just gotta find the crevice.
[58:58.83]Shit, it's not there.
[58:59.83]Where is it?
[59:00.23]It's over here somewhere.
[59:00.93]I've got to remember this next time.
[59:04.01]It's all the way on the right side then.
[59:05.85]Found it.
[59:06.21]Okay, there's the crevice.
[59:09.94]This takes me back to where I was.
[59:11.56]Okay, now I'm going to go down.
[59:17.70]Because now I'm okay.
[59:18.84]Now I know how to get back here.
[59:19.82]Alright, we're fine.
[59:33.97]I'm gonna take a look.
[59:36.39]There's an item right there.
[59:37.93]Get off me.
[59:38.37]Is this guy still alive?
[59:43.17]Not anymore.
[59:43.65]Okay.
[59:50.00]Item.
[59:53.02]Celebrate warrior.
[59:53.96]I need that.
[59:54.50]Alright, um...
[60:03.70]I'm going to get caught by the current here.
[60:09.42]Is this something... Am I... Wait, no, no, no.
[60:10.82]This is water in Dark Souls.
[60:12.06]Am I going to die instantly by walking into this?
[60:16.71]Is this like knee deep or is this die because Dark Souls is like Super Mario 1?
[60:24.39]I don't think I can do this.
[60:26.69]So we're going to go back.
[60:33.71]I don't know if you're supposed to ride the wave down there to fight the boss.
[60:41.27]Look, I'll just throw knives at him from here.
[60:42.92]There's a bridge right there, though.
[60:46.82]Where does that bridge go?
[60:48.52]Okay, so down around the corner there.
[60:50.66]It looks like I can go down here.
[60:51.72]Can I get that from here?
[60:56.40]No.
[61:03.36]Your stone armor.
[61:06.33]I didn't want to swim.
[61:07.59]I'm just taking a look.
[61:16.06]I didn't go.
[61:16.58]Where did I not go?
[61:23.12]I saw the real boss already.
[61:24.45]Yeah, that was a big double doors, but what is...
[61:41.08]Is that a cat?
[61:42.25]It is a giant cat!
[61:43.81]Should I not kill this thing?
[61:48.17]Okay, I think I have to kill this thing.
[61:51.79]Come on, I gotta get it up his ass.
[61:53.97]Come on, up his ass.
[61:55.17]Come on.
[61:56.65]What the fuck?
[61:58.21]Why?
[61:58.54]But I'm a traitor though, right?
[62:03.10]Didn't they say don't be a traitor?
[62:08.26]What?
[62:08.48]How did I hear him?
[62:14.81]I knew it.
[62:15.61]I did.
[62:15.85]They said don't be a traitor.
[62:21.03]Oh my fucking god.
[62:25.57]Thank god for the P-O-W-S-E.
[62:27.64]Whatever it is.
[62:28.52]The poise.
[62:30.02]Okay, I gotta run.
[62:30.90]I gotta get in a better spot.
[62:32.30]I don't get it.
[62:33.44]Large soul of a brave little toaster.
[62:39.16]They left.
[62:42.96]I hear them still though.
[62:52.00]Okay.
[62:55.01]Where the fuck am I going?
[62:58.47]One of these mushroom men.
[63:02.25]There's the bridge.
[63:10.49]I still hear them.
[63:12.92]I still hear them.
[63:14.30]Alright.
[63:18.68]It looks like I'm going to have to go the other way there.
[63:22.42]It's time to go over here.
[63:28.22]Right there.
[63:28.96]There's a boss.
[63:30.10]Find the way over there.
[63:32.38]They can't fit through the trees.
[63:33.38]Well, thank god I didn't get killed.
[63:41.41]Alright.
[63:41.85]Here we go.
[63:42.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[63:50.79]Why is everybody telling me to stop?
[63:55.06]Do the DLC first or it's ruined.
[63:57.04]Why?
[63:57.14]What are you talking about?
[64:02.74]Why is everybody freaking out right now?
[64:13.73]No, I'm fighting the boss.
[64:14.85]I'm not doing like the roundabout, do the DLC first.
[64:17.15]We'll do it after this.
[64:21.79]Special cutscene?
[64:23.05]Who gives a shit?
[64:29.83]Let me see.
[64:30.19]Well, I'm not going to go yet.
[64:31.07]It looks like I can go up here.
[64:34.75]I can't.
[64:35.21]Okay.
[64:36.79]I'm going to be hated forever if I do this.
[64:38.73]What are you talking about?
[64:40.23]I'm opening the door, okay?
[64:41.81]I'm going to open the door and I'm going to fight the boss that's in this door.
[64:53.07]Whatever it is in here, I'm fighting it.
[64:55.05]I got a lot of souls to lose, but it's okay.
[64:57.20]We're going to first try this guy.
[65:04.71]Where is he?
[65:12.13]No, it's going to be like the sword and the stone.
[65:13.75]I have to go grab the sword and pull it out and then... He's going to come and be like, that's my blade!
[65:20.07]You have no purpose taking my sword.
[65:22.10]Oh, I know what this boss is.

[67:45.46]Drink from the fountain.
[67:48.74]Delete your channel.
[67:50.28]What?
[67:51.14]Is that really a problem here?
[67:56.84]Now I'm going to go take the sword because he didn't want me to touch it.
[68:00.95]See?
[68:01.25]There's the sword.
[68:02.41]No, it's the hornet ring.
[68:06.78]Sif did attack me first, that's right.
[68:08.10]Alright, well, what is that?
[68:09.02]Hornet Ring.
[68:14.96]Boost critical attack.
[68:17.98]One of the special rings granted to the four knights of Gwyn.
[68:21.31]The Hornet Ring belonged to the Lord's Blade Tarion.
[68:24.43]By boosting critical attacks, it's where it can annihilate foes.
[68:30.75]Okay, so that is... This is to make your crit damage way higher.
[68:35.13]Cool.
[68:36.51]So that's if you have good parry skills and you really want to kill people in one attack.
[68:42.73]Pretty great.
[68:44.53]Alright.
[68:46.01]That's all that's here, I think.
[68:50.88]Let me just take a look around.
[68:52.18]Hold on, everybody.
[68:58.40]Dark Souls has crit damage.
[68:59.46]It's not what you're thinking.
[69:01.94]Crit damage only happens...
[69:04.27]On a backstab or a parry.
[69:06.93]That is the only way it can happen.
[69:08.68]Unless I'm... Does bleed do it too?
[69:11.74]If you do blood loss enough, right?
[69:14.04]No, is that not correct?
[69:21.14]Alright, well this is where it came in.
[69:25.52]Read the other ring.
[69:27.01]Idiot.
[69:30.37]Jesus fucking Christ, man.
[69:36.62]This ring symbolizes Knight Artorias' covenant with the Beast of the Abyss.
[69:40.10]Its wearer, like Artorias, can traverse the Abyss.
[69:43.91]So I can go into the Abyss now.
[69:46.95]Sorry for strangling your son by not reading that.
[69:50.95]Because that's the equivalent of what I just did.
[69:55.71]So we can now go fight the other boss, which I already did.
[70:05.92]you aren't forgiven alright that's nothing else I can do in here so now we're gonna go remember when I did new londo and I cleared all of new londo well now this is just like boss rush stream I can probably just bone out of here then huh yeah I think that's what I'll do I think that's what I'll do
[70:36.53]Let's go.
[70:36.83]Alright, let's rest and level up.
[70:49.62]I wonder if I should just keep going with this.
[70:52.46]Strength is currently soft capped, but I might need it for the smog hammer eventually when I don't care.
[71:03.19]Hmm... Put it into Faith.
[71:06.17]I'm not going to put it into Faith.
[71:09.33]Smile.
[71:09.89]Smag.
[71:14.69]Put it into Dex.
[71:15.47]It's going to take a lot to get there.
[71:17.49]I don't want to use the Halberd.
[71:21.54]I'm just going into fucking Endurance.
[71:22.78]I'm just going to be a heavyweight champion.
[71:29.82]Alright, so... Now...
[71:33.73]Let me think about this now.
[71:34.99]So now I can go to do the four kings.
[71:38.90]You must defeat the kings!
[71:40.34]The four kings, they're all there!
[71:42.00]I opened up that.
[71:45.56]We already did all of New Londo.
[71:46.76]It's all done.
[71:47.26]You just have to walk to the boss.
[71:55.11]So, from here...
[72:01.27]Let me think.
[72:03.87]We could go to the archives, which is from Anolando.
[72:13.64]One ring to rule them all.
[72:16.32]Okay, the DLC.
[72:18.42]Is it one of those scenarios like in all the Dark Souls games where there's no way I'll know how to get there unless I look it up?
[72:26.65]Because there's always some weird, convoluted mess of a way to do the DLC.
[72:30.93]Okay, so... So I don't feel bad asking, where do I go?
[72:39.78]So from here, where do we do the DLC?
[72:48.92]So I gotta go... I have to stay here.
[72:58.31]So go down and fight the thing that's down there.
[73:03.29]Okay.
[73:05.45]Now can I get there from here?
[73:07.85]Should I just traverse down there?
[73:15.10]Okay.
[73:19.20]I already killed Havel.
[73:20.62]I already have his stuff.
[73:24.64]It's under that bridge.
[73:25.50]Okay.
[73:27.29]So let's go back over here.
[73:33.34]I think we've got to go over here.
[73:41.88]You mean Havel?
[73:42.62]Yeah, of course I mean Havel.
[73:46.74]Who else would I be talking about?
[73:54.96]Don't push me off.
[73:55.70]I'm just trying to find the crevice.
[73:57.19]Don't push me off.
[73:59.03]Where was it?
[73:59.45]I missed it.
[74:04.44]No, I got the entire forest after me.
[74:10.74]Where's the crevice?
[74:12.66]Did I miss the crevice?
[74:16.34]God damn it, where's the fucking crevice?
[74:25.73]Where's the crevice?
[74:27.53]Oh, wait a minute!
[74:28.95]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[74:29.87]I can do it, right?
[74:30.77]Come on, I can do it.
[74:31.87]I can do it.
[74:32.81]I can do it.
[74:33.34]I can do anything.
[74:33.98]I feel good.
[74:42.42]Made it.
[74:50.04]I know there was a voice crack there.
[74:51.30]I know.
[74:51.62]Just relax.
[74:59.08]And I know I've done the James Brown joke like 12 times, but sometimes material works.
[75:05.14]Sometimes you've got good material to work with.
[75:08.83]Alright, we're gonna fight.
[75:09.61]Wait a minute.
[75:09.97]This is water.
[75:10.73]Excuse me.
[75:19.50]Am I fat rolling now, though?
[75:20.76]Yeah.
[75:21.14]God damn it.
[75:21.62]Okay.
[75:21.72]Okay.
[75:27.58]52.
[75:27.66]This has got to come way down.
[75:33.30]Looks like 27.
[75:34.86]Silver Knight is 38.
[75:35.54]What do we need?
[75:39.19]40.
[75:39.21]We can't go past, like, 46.
[75:46.29]Let's put on, like, the weird... Who cares?
[75:48.21]Alright.
[75:49.05]We're fine.
[75:49.47]It doesn't matter.
[75:52.72]Alright.
[75:55.34]Is he going to start attacking me immediately?
[75:58.19]Is there some special way to do this?
[76:06.50]I'm not going to die in the water.
[76:07.42]Do I have to fight him on the land if I step in the water?
[76:09.16]Don't I die?
[76:09.64]Okay, so let's think about this.
[76:18.35]Whoa!
[76:19.93]Alright, that's like a Sonic boom.
[76:22.35]I'm going to die if I step in the water, aren't I?
[76:25.05]Okay, I can walk in this water.
[76:31.80]Jesus Christ.
[76:32.90]Okay, hold on.
[76:40.02]How the fuck?
[76:43.65]Dead?
[76:44.77]Not dead.
[76:45.17]Okay, I'm alive.
[76:48.49]What do I do?
[76:50.09]Wow!
[76:54.09]He doesn't have that much health.
[76:57.02]I gotta be ready to dodge.
[77:03.53]Get the smist out of my face.
[77:10.03]Fuck.
[77:14.19]Oh my god.
[77:16.29]Jesus.
[77:17.79]Cut it, cut it.
[77:18.53]Ah, shit.
[77:19.25]Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[77:21.45]They bait you with two.
[77:23.49]So they go, one, two, and then one comes over across.
[77:28.74]It's this one.
[77:37.42]Oh, we got four more heads left?
[77:41.82]Oh, shit!
[77:44.02]We're good.
[77:45.86]Which one is gonna land now?
[77:46.72]This one?
[77:51.39]Oh, my... What?
[77:59.83]Wait, wait, wait, why?
[78:00.81]What?
[78:05.00]I thought I could... Did I just get, like, glitched through the ground?
[78:12.86]Hold on.
[78:13.56]Wait, there's a certain part of the water you can't be in?
[78:17.04]The underwater ledge.
[78:18.36]Oh, of course there is.
[78:21.54]Oh my fucking god.
[78:28.47]I knew there was a... I knew it.
[78:30.41]I didn't even need to see it.
[78:32.07]Whatever, let's just jump on the bridge again.
[78:35.71]Oh well.
[78:38.01]That's a feature.
[78:38.73]Alright, where was I?
[78:40.55]Over there.
[78:40.91]Gotta go this way.
[78:47.24]I need to look out before... Oh, that sucks.
[78:50.24]Was I just accidentally missing all of that, by the way?
[78:53.26]Was it like a remarkable feat that I didn't fall off?
[78:57.69]No, I'm jumping off from here.
[78:59.13]I'm not going in the crevice.
[79:01.31]I'm doing the same jump.
[79:08.84]That's kind of funny, though.
[79:10.00]Whatever.
[79:11.50]I got really close several times.
[79:17.81]Alright, line it up right here.
[79:19.19]Oh.
[79:21.05]Oh my god.
[79:24.33]Oh no.
[79:26.26]No, no.
[79:28.18]Okay, we're fine.
[79:30.06]You know, this is probably a ten times easier way to do this.
[79:33.94]Let me see.
[79:34.24]Can I see it from here?
[79:35.10]No.
[79:37.88]I can just go down the ladder.
[79:40.64]Let me take a look.
[79:41.42]Where is it?
[79:42.99]Alright, the trick is I gotta get right over there and run right to him.
[79:48.40]Because those globules that he shoots out are... They'll kill you instantly.
[79:53.71]Just get over there.
[79:57.33]Okay, where is it?
[79:58.03]I can't even see it.
[80:01.21]I can't even see the damn thing.
[80:03.41]How are you guys seeing that?
[80:07.59]I can't... Where am I?
[80:08.61]Oh, that's not a wall.
[80:09.53]That's his head.
[80:11.17]I'm so paranoid, right?
[80:12.13]Okay, I see it.
[80:12.57]I see it.
[80:12.81]I see it.
[80:18.54]It's forward, it's not... Fuck.
[80:27.38]I'm so paranoid.
[80:34.14]Where'd he go?
[80:34.86]Oh, he's right there!
[80:36.14]Damn it!
[80:36.86]This is too... That guy's got two.
[80:43.24]Did I just get two right there?
[80:48.69]Ow.
[80:49.43]Alright, it's the guy right in front of me.
[80:50.45]Can I still get him?
[80:52.47]Yep.
[81:00.06]Where's the next one?
[81:00.92]This guy over on the left.
[81:01.88]Okay, don't fall off the edge.
[81:02.98]It's right there.
[81:04.14]Pull back.
[81:10.26]I can't walk over there, man.
[81:12.94]You guys have to be so paranoid.
[81:13.92]You should never have told me.
[81:15.81]You guys should have told me I got glitched out.
[81:17.26]And I probably would have beat this already.
[81:20.24]I'm so paranoid.
[81:21.10]About falling off.
[81:22.70]Okay, he's there.
[81:26.30]Up.
[81:28.34]Okay, up here.
[81:30.09]Jesus Christ.
[81:30.77]Okay, I can stand on this.
[81:36.41]And two more.
[81:44.84]Come on, do it.
[81:49.35]They go right here.
[81:51.37]Ow, really?
[81:52.03]Don't do this to me.
[81:53.25]Got it.
[81:54.87]No, I didn't.
[81:56.47]Okay, so it's dead.
[81:57.21]Alright.
[81:58.75]Now what?
[82:01.54]Dragon Scale and Dusk Crown Ring.
[82:05.18]Well, I need that Dragon Scale for my big weapon.
[82:10.32]Get my souls back.
[82:12.52]I don't think I had anything.
[82:13.43]Let me see.
[82:16.23]So what the hell was that?
[82:21.89]What was it called?
[82:24.33]Grants extra magic castings, but halves HP.
[82:30.99]This magic crown-shaped ring was granted to Princess Dusk of Olakail upon her birth.
[82:37.22]Allows its wearer to cast additional magics, but at the cost of one half of HP.
[82:40.00]Okay.
[82:45.15]So, now, how do I get that item?
[82:53.12]Where's the ledge stop?
[82:55.44]I hate this.
[82:58.39]No, it's right here.
[82:59.21]We'll find it.
[83:04.13]I'm gonna walk right off.
[83:05.91]I'm so scared.
[83:07.77]Night helm.
[83:08.45]Okay.
[83:15.35]Reload the game.
[83:18.61]Reload the game.
[83:19.63]I have to save and reload?
[83:29.34]Reload from the main menu?
[83:34.66]Hold on, there's currently a guy taking a bath over here.
[83:48.74]Okay, hold on a second.
[83:51.78]Save and reload.
[84:00.95]You sure?
[84:01.45]So now what?
[84:43.43]Go over here.
[84:44.33]I'm going to fall here.
[84:46.93]This way?
[84:48.95]Am I going to fall off?
[84:49.95]Am I going to fall off here?
[85:00.92]I never would have fucking done this.
[85:02.42]I never would have figured this out.
[85:06.07]I'm okay with taking an ultra vac seat here because I never would have found this DLC.
[85:11.13]What is this thing?
[85:21.95]Kill and then reload the game.
[85:26.29]What the fuck?
[85:48.00]Okay.
[85:48.58]I killed him.
[85:50.58]A person fell out.
[85:57.21]Okay, I can talk to this person.
[85:59.15]How would anybody want to figure this out?
[86:05.52]I am Dusk of Ulusil.
[86:07.86]I cometh from an age long before thine.
[86:11.16]So she was the mosquito in the Jurassic Park candy stuff.
[86:14.34]I'm going to say yes, because that's probably yes, please take me to the DLC area.
[86:23.17]Yes, ma'am, I would love to see the DLC.
[86:27.05]Okay.
[86:48.73]May the great flames guide thee.
[86:50.01]Where's the door?
[87:14.46]Where's the door to go into the DLC?
[87:16.98]Welcome to the Dark Souls DLC!
[87:18.58]Are you prepared, man?
[87:20.78]Time to grit your teeth!
[87:22.12]Where's like the guy in the loading screen to tell me all these things?
[87:27.94]Now, reload the game again.
[87:31.12]What is this nonsense?
[87:45.15]Alright, is she here again?
[87:46.17]With the door?
[87:52.07]Alright.
[87:56.07]Now it's time to go back.
[87:57.31]And now I have to go to the new area.
[88:03.25]You got it.
[88:03.65]So I have to... There's no ladder or anything, so I have to go up.
[88:16.06]Actually, there is a ladder, isn't there?
[88:18.12]What is over here on the right?
[88:19.04]Let me see.
[88:19.92]I've got to spin three times and then reload the game again.
[88:26.21]Get out of here.
[88:30.06]I just want to see what's up here.
[88:33.94]This connects back up to the original...
[88:45.49]Talked to her three times.
[88:47.69]I would not be surprised, man.
[88:48.65]There's some weird... Like the Bloodborne DLC, for instance.
[88:52.27]Remember that shit?
[88:53.74]Remember how you got into Bloodborne's DLC?
[88:56.74]Who the hell ever would have fucking figured that out if it wasn't for a goddamn Wikipedia page?
[89:08.53]Oh, okay.
[89:08.91]There's this over here.
[89:09.65]What's this?
[89:13.53]This is a summon sign.
[89:14.49]Is this her?
[89:18.41]What did I just do?
[89:22.97]Okay, that's her.
[89:23.57]Purchase item?
[89:28.17]Learn?
[89:28.53]Purchase item?
[89:30.13]In case she has... Okay.
[89:31.45]Learn gesture.
[89:32.31]Proper bow.
[89:32.69]Talk.
[89:46.66]For a very long time, I was trapped within the Crystal Golem.
[89:51.28]From my home, I was taken, banished to a plane of distortion.
[89:56.02]It was there that thou came to my rescue, long after I had relinquished all hope.
[90:01.68]So gleeful was I. Okay.
[90:05.41]So you're just a... Okay, cool.
[90:09.21]Well, bye.
[90:10.35]So, I learned the gesture how to properly bow.
[90:16.41]Slay her.
[90:16.85]I'm not going to kill her.
[90:19.05]I don't care if that would give me 500,000 souls.
[90:21.33]I'm not doing it.
[90:24.08]Just curious as to what's up this way and if I can connect it to somewhere else in my brain that I've been before.
[90:30.48]Also, put on the Havel's Ring again.
[90:34.84]And let's get my stone stuff back-back on because it is good stuff.
[90:42.72]Yes, I can put the stone gauntlets on, right?
[90:48.02]stone uh I actually kind of like half was better poison curse resistant though no that's the wrong item fire defense a little more strike defense but you lose poise that's alright we'll keep it like this alright so what's up here
[91:14.04]This is just... Alright, this is that.
[91:18.32]That's where I was before, but over here.
[91:24.42]Just want to take a look, guys.
[91:25.58]Don't worry.
[91:26.88]This is the... Okay, I know where we are now.
[91:29.32]So I'm just going to... Okay, now I'll bone out.
[91:31.00]I know where we are.
[91:31.56]I got to pee.
[91:36.90]So take this opportunity toberger to pee, too.
[91:39.12]And make sure you pee into a toilet.
[91:48.67]I will just be right back in two minutes.
[91:53.61]See you in a second.
[93:57.90]Alright.
[94:00.62]How you doing?
[94:03.86]Let us head over to Anor Londo.
[94:08.83]Why not?
[94:13.89]Yes.
[94:16.49]That scared me.
[94:17.39]Well, you didn't think I was coming back?
[94:19.29]Alright.
[94:24.81]Let us... Hold on.
[94:26.47]I think I have some souls to crush.
[94:31.24]Sif.
[94:32.00]Okay, what do I get for Sif's item?
[94:35.28]Worth holding on to or no?
[94:37.62]Ah, fuck.
[94:46.14]Probably not.
[94:50.22]Some swords or shields.
[94:51.22]Not that worth it.
[94:51.84]The big sword he swung at you.
[94:53.02]Yeah, I'm not going to use it.
[94:56.43]Crush it.
[95:00.13]That should be enough for... No, not quite.
[95:03.20]I think I have a couple of those.
[95:08.22]Yeah, I got Large Soul of a Brave Warrior.
[95:09.94]Use it.
[95:13.63]I just absorbed the dog.
[95:14.67]Is that a problem?
[95:18.33]Okay, let's go Endurance again.
[95:20.73]More Endurance.
[95:21.49]More Endurance.
[95:25.27]To Anor Londo we go.
[95:27.27]Let's do it.
[95:32.85]This shitty streamer killed Ornstein first, never watching him again.
[95:36.11]What am I supposed to do?
[95:37.33]Like the secret way to do everything?
[95:38.89]Here he is.
[95:48.76]He's still here.
[95:53.02]Still here.
[95:56.46]For now.
[95:57.94]I put on the new rings.
[95:59.12]Yes, I did.
[96:01.22]I gotta get this off the bar.
[96:02.78]There will be a point in this.
[96:05.10]When I lose my fucking mind screaming about that.
[96:07.41]Why did I keep it on my bar?
[96:08.81]What's wrong with me?
[96:09.83]Look at these guys.
[96:21.73]These guys give me trouble because they move so slow.
[96:28.39]Oh, fuck.
[96:28.87]Come on.
[96:33.97]They only take like two... They took two hits last time, too, didn't they?
[96:37.66]I couldn't figure them out.
[96:38.46]Alright.
[96:47.08]We could not go up here before.
[96:48.58]This was blocked off with the golden seal.
[96:52.95]So.
[96:54.61]Here we go.
[96:56.39]First new area of the game.
[96:58.83]There's a giant animal here.
[97:05.03]He's gonna charge at me.
[97:05.87]I know this works.
[97:07.01]I've seen this before.
[97:10.45]Here he comes.
[97:11.05]Okay.
[97:11.75]We have to do this just like a bull in... I can go up his ass.
[97:17.15]I know that for certain.
[97:21.95]Go up his ass!
[97:23.09]Up his ass!
[97:23.91]Why?
[97:31.53]You can't go up their ass, whatever.
[97:32.56]Alright, we got left or right.
[97:35.32]Let's see.
[97:35.80]Illusions or anything.
[97:38.42]This is a cool looking place.
[97:51.67]I can see his tusks.
[97:54.13]Well, it's a good thing I stopped moving.
[97:56.37]Oh, God.
[98:01.35]This one's... Is he smaller?
[98:02.57]Please don't tell me this is just a default enemy in this area.
[98:07.10]It probably is.
[98:07.72]Well, it's not even worth doing.
[98:13.54]Ow.
[98:20.26]Okay, uh, here's a bonfire.
[98:22.86]Probably should kindle this.
[98:24.00]Fangbore Helm!
[98:27.68]Oh, come on.
[98:28.32]That's probably gonna look so stupid.
[98:30.00]I have to put it on.
[98:35.02]No, I'm gonna look like a pig.
[98:36.06]This is gonna be perfect.
[98:36.66]I'm going to beat a pig.
[98:40.16]Damn.
[98:46.13]Severed head of the fully armored Fang Boar taken by the one who killed it as proof of his victory.
[98:51.63]Just as the gods once did with the head of the ancient dragon, can be worn on the head as a surprisingly sound piece of protective gear.
[99:08.41]This is... I lose the... Let me see what the HP increases.
[99:13.41]Alright, we're going to line this up with the flame, okay?
[99:18.11]Right on the flame.
[99:19.80]So we'll see just how much more... Right on the edge of the flame.
[99:24.92]Let's put the head back on and see how far it goes.
[99:29.71]Mask of the Mom.
[99:33.81]That's...
[99:39.16]You can check the HP stat.
[99:41.10]Yeah, but numbers only say so much.
[99:42.40]I want to know how many centimeters and inches we got here.
[99:50.28]That's not a big deal at all, actually.
[99:52.14]Go back to the funny helmet.
[99:55.33]But now I kind of need to... I need to roleplay now, right?
[100:03.81]This doesn't look funny enough.
[100:06.13]Like, now it does.
[100:16.15]But now that means I can put on... Instead of these... How much more toys are these worth?
[100:24.04]Not much.
[100:26.92]Yeah, I mean, I kind of... I want to be the pig.
[100:28.68]It looks fun.
[100:29.44]I want to be fun for a little while.
[100:30.68]Even if it's worse.
[100:31.36]Alright.
[100:35.66]Light the bonfire.
[100:36.36]I'm going to kindle this.
[100:38.84]Probably.
[100:39.26]Good idea.
[100:49.39]fun what do you mean fun okay well let me take a look nothing this way just some bureaus a couple of ways to go uh sundial contraption doesn't move none of this stuff moves
[101:19.15]We just have to go up here.
[101:24.74]Jerma's having fun, but that's about to change.
[101:28.08]Why?
[101:28.22]Does this place suck?
[101:31.56]Am I going to be upset about this place?
[101:33.88]This place looks kind of cool already.
[101:37.44]I like the way this is like... Alright, well, hold on.
[101:39.42]We got people coming.
[101:40.99]Ow.
[101:46.37]What in the name of God was that?
[101:49.26]Hold on.
[101:49.72]Wait, wait, wait.
[101:50.20]That was weird.
[101:51.78]Was I not fast enough?
[101:52.66]Alright, that was odd.
[101:56.88]He was only... I'm so confused right now that my brain cannot handle fighting any of these guys.
[102:05.42]So they're only stunned for like a half second.
[102:13.51]Okay.
[102:14.85]Okay.
[102:16.53]Watch out for this guy.
[102:17.35]Okay.
[102:27.80]Alright.
[102:29.58]Well, there's the crystal guy that I need to kill.
[102:31.55]That everyone's been yelling at me for.

[102:54.80]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:59.76]No, I want to knock you, this guy.
[103:05.40]These guys come back to life or something?
[103:06.56]What am I missing here?
[103:10.99]Okay, he's dead.
[103:12.95]Broken Pendant.

[104:23.62]No, I'm totally fine with people backseating here, for real.
[104:26.90]Because... How the fuck am I supposed to know what this stuff is?
[104:39.64]I gotta go back where I killed that golem.

[104:45.75]Alright, so I can do... I got another... How many do I need?
[104:51.29]Shit, I need another one.

[104:57.01]That's all I can do here.
[104:58.05]Although, hold on.
[105:01.51]No, that's enough.
[105:09.16]Backseat until the final boss.
[105:10.52]That ain't gonna happen.
[105:14.00]Did I eat any vegetables today?
[105:15.20]No, actually I didn't.
[105:16.10]I had a pretty shit diet today.
[105:21.30]Not good diet at all here, guys.

[105:36.68]And a coffee.
[105:37.32]That's it.
[105:42.66]It's funny because yesterday I had like a great beet salad and some sushi.
[105:46.31]I ate really well yesterday.
[105:48.69]Not today.
[105:49.11]Go get some food.

[107:04.71]That shit is fucking garbage can food.
[107:06.85]And we all eat it.
[107:20.48]Don't give me the Mercury thing.

[107:53.81]I almost just walked off the fucking edge because I'm like looking at chat and being angry about my fish diet being criticized You can eat tuna fish like come on just don't eat tuna fish like seven times a week
[108:26.43]I don't know why I keep doing this.
[108:29.81]It's burned into my brain to do it like this.
[108:39.78]Alright, here we go.
[108:41.08]Let's go down.
[108:41.63]Hey, I got news for you guys.
[108:49.55]Everything is bad for you.
[108:51.33]Everything.
[108:53.56]There ain't nothing in this world that is actually really good for you.
[108:58.19]It all has a fucking pro and a con.
[109:00.32]Every single food is bad for you.
[109:03.95]Everything.
[109:05.41]They did studies.
[109:06.41]They've done studies.
[109:08.03]Like 10 years ago.
[109:08.87]Let me tell you something.
[109:10.09]Apple a day keeps the doctor away.
[109:12.19]Make sure you eat plenty of apples.
[109:13.65]Apples are the best fruit ever.
[109:15.23]Eat only apples.
[109:16.73]There's a recent study.
[109:17.75]Don't eat apples anymore.
[109:18.85]You're going to get stomach problems.
[109:20.59]Apples are bad.
[109:21.43]Only eat them sometimes.
[109:23.15]Watch out.
[109:23.49]There's poison in the seeds too.
[109:25.63]Be careful.
[109:29.72]Hey, make sure you drink coffee.
[109:31.17]Coffee makes your, you know, the world go round.
[109:33.15]Drink coffee.
[109:33.75]Don't drink coffee.
[109:35.03]It actually has led to brain problems.
[109:37.35]And then there's a new study.
[109:38.29]Drink coffee.
[109:39.09]It's good for migraines.
[109:41.41]Don't listen to these fucking people.
[109:42.69]Eat whatever you want as long as you do it in moderation.
[109:48.88]Here's the thing I gotta walk into.
[109:52.64]First let me get the item.
[109:55.30]I know what that crown does.
[109:56.14]I put it on in Dark Souls 3.
[110:00.10]Eat whatever you want.
[110:02.30]As long as you're not eating sticks of butter every day, you know, you can have a stick of butter.
[110:07.97]Guess what?
[110:09.07]People that are scoffing at me and going, oh, feet of butter.
[110:11.63]What is this fucking dumbass?
[110:13.27]Have you had a batch of fucking cookies before?
[110:15.51]You ever eat a cake?
[110:17.39]There's like half, there's like two sticks of butter in a cake.
[110:20.45]How many times have you eaten a full cake before?
[110:22.29]I know I've done it once or twice.
[110:23.56]You've eaten two sticks of butter.
[110:25.28]Come on.
[110:32.30]You ever eaten a whole pizza by yourself?
[110:34.10]I've shared a pizza with two people before.
[110:37.02]You know how much fucking cheese and dog shit is in a whole pizza that you've eaten like six slices of?
[110:48.04]You've all done it.
[110:48.70]You've all done it.
[110:49.20]You can't tell me you haven't done that.
[110:53.08]What?
[110:53.26]Hold on a minute.
[110:53.66]This guy's talking about how he like ate like half of a large pizza before.
[110:56.97]I've never done that before.
[110:58.01]Never.
[110:59.22]I've never done something like that.
[111:00.56]How disgusting can you be?
[111:02.80]By the way, my delivery is scheduled on my Yelp app.
[111:06.36]It'll be here in 13 minutes.
[111:07.84]A large fucking pizza.
[111:18.82]Well, I would certainly hope so.
[111:20.22]I paid good money for that extra shit.
[111:23.06]Yeah, that's fine.
[111:24.64]Alright, I'm gonna enforce this.
[111:32.23]Can you eat manticores?
[111:33.35]No, that's a magical not real animal.
[111:35.22]You can't eat it.
[111:36.12]It doesn't exist.
[111:41.78]What was I doing?
[111:43.52]Oh, yeah.
[111:47.44]I only have plus three Estus.
[111:49.16]Don't make fun of me for that.
[111:52.12]I'm dumb.
[111:52.58]What do you mean dumb?
[111:55.44]No.
[111:55.80]It's time for me to do what I want.
[111:57.00]I'm going to eat what I want, okay?
[111:58.48]And I want to eat two estuses.
[112:00.72]I mean, two humanities.
[112:11.49]Oh, god damn it.
[112:12.15]I need another one.
[112:17.06]Mercury Estus.
[112:20.34]No, you guys are all so judgmental.
[112:26.99]If it's not the food you eat, it's the item you just used in Dark... No, I'm kidding.
[112:37.03]Let's get the plus 10.
[112:38.91]That's alright.
[112:42.00]Mercury.
[112:42.50]Dude, everyone puts out these like fucking hit pieces on every piece of food.
[112:48.64]You see the big... Hold on.
[112:50.02]Did you guys see the big hit piece that was put on red meat like a year or two ago?
[112:55.01]About how all red meat causes cancer?
[112:57.49]All of it is carcinogenic.
[112:58.71]All of it.
[112:59.75]Like it was a hit piece.
[113:00.55]It was just straight up like a hit piece.
[113:02.33]Go look it up.
[113:09.98]It was essentially saying if you ate red meat, don't eat red meat ever again.
[113:13.88]You're dead if you eat it.
[113:14.86]It was just a hit piece.
[113:19.48]Just eat whatever you want, but don't eat too much of it.
[113:21.18]Alright, let's fight the DLC boss.
[113:24.72]That actually is the DLC boss.
[113:26.04]That was very easy to get to.
[113:27.14]Okay.
[113:28.58]So I know somebody said manticore for a very particular reason, I guess.
[113:32.52]And you move very fast.
[113:33.66]Okay, you're a guy that moves fast.
[113:35.08]I gotta be quiet here.
[113:36.33]Stop talking about eating him.
[113:41.96]Holy shit.
[113:42.68]Alright, hold on.
[113:45.33]Whoa, I heard him.
[113:50.79]What's he doing?
[113:57.83]I do a lot of... Okay, he's a glass cannon here.
[113:59.94]I gotta just be... I gotta get some hits in.
[114:07.40]Poisoned.
[114:10.51]The whole the whole ground turns into poison and electricity not poison stupid No, that's bad This is a fight about aggression I got to stay aggressive
[114:39.84]Holy shit.
[114:41.22]He probably grabs you.
[114:43.42]Cut the tail.
[114:43.86]Cut the tail.
[114:44.46]Cut a scorpion tail.
[114:47.31]Right?
[114:55.93]What does that mean?
[115:00.75]Oh, fuck.
[115:05.72]Oh, man.
[115:06.32]That's hard to dodge.
[115:06.98]I'm going to do it again.
[115:12.80]Oh my god, I'm not touching anything he's doing.
[115:15.06]I'm so fucked.
[115:21.00]He's so fast.
[115:24.04]I'm not gonna beat him here.
[115:32.32]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[115:33.12]Alright, new plan.
[115:36.86]New plan.
[115:39.89]I'm taking off all this armor.
[115:42.85]Because you gotta move around faster than this.
[115:45.55]So here we go.
[115:49.13]We need to get down to not mid-rolling here.
[115:51.72]What does it take?
[115:56.46]That's it right there, isn't it?
[116:00.40]Is that it?
[116:00.76]Can I just put up 44 and 1?
[116:05.08]No, that's not it, right?
[116:08.20]Nope.
[116:11.46]There it is.
[116:11.88]Okay.
[116:13.57]So what are we at now?
[116:14.11]35.
[116:14.13]Can I put on like a fucking... I need like lightning resistance, right?
[116:20.05]Might as well try to put on some lightning resistance here.
[116:23.67]21, 25, 18.
[116:25.13]34 for the Silver Knight.
[116:28.61]21 for this one.
[116:29.27]Let's put this on just for now so we can take a look at the rest.
[116:33.33]54 for the Stone Armor.
[116:34.61]Jesus Christ.
[116:39.27]This is better.
[116:41.37]Doesn't weigh a lot either, does it?
[116:42.97]No, it doesn't.
[116:47.62]Okay.
[116:49.08]Take this off.
[116:52.18]Looking for lightning.
[116:53.38]Lightning and lower... Okay, 15.
[116:55.53]20.
[116:55.95]No, it's still on.
[117:00.27]8.
[117:00.53]No, I'm not putting the bug helmet on.
[117:01.99]Not in a million years.
[117:03.09]9.
[117:07.45]None of this is any good for lightning, huh?
[117:11.90]14.
[117:14.06]Oh, this stuff all sucks.
[117:19.92]I'm going to stay under, like, 36-ish.
[117:22.96]35.
[117:22.98]Uh, well.
[117:26.18]Still at 29.
[117:26.88]I can keep these up, but I'll see if I find something better.
[117:36.27]That lightning really isn't... No, this is alright.
[117:38.25]I'll try it like this.
[117:42.63]That looks alright for me.
[117:43.81]Alright, let's go.
[117:47.89]Moving around is better.
[117:52.13]I have an idea of what he does.
[117:53.49]Let's see if I get my ass kicked again.
[118:13.82]Bad move.
[118:20.04]Ah!
[118:24.19]Got it!
[118:25.41]Got the tail.
[118:26.95]Oh my god, I could have just beat his... Shit!
[118:35.92]Shit!
[118:36.86]I'm dead.
[118:37.68]Ah!
[118:38.86]I was too focused on the tail!
[118:41.60]I got it, whatever.
[118:49.92]That's the one thing, the one thing that I really don't like about these games.
[118:53.59]Is like, when you do something like that, and the whole screen dims, and it's like, look what you got!
[118:58.77]And it takes up the whole fucking screen.
[119:00.78]Like, can't you just put that in the corner, man?
[119:02.42]Like, does it have to, like, do I have to press X?

[119:20.19]Wait, what did it just pick up?
[119:27.53]There it is.
[119:27.91]Okay, what is this?
[119:28.70]It's a whip?
[119:30.46]Okay, that's cool.
[119:35.58]So it's a poison whip.
[119:38.13]Yeah, that's alright.
[119:41.37]Except not really.
[119:42.57]Alright, let's do it.
[119:43.17]Third time's a charm.
[119:43.97]No, like, tale to get in my rearview mirror while I'm trying to drive.
[119:56.83]Okay, let's go.
[120:15.03]Fuck, I didn't want to do that!
[120:23.38]Damn!
[120:32.16]Such a bad opportunities every time can you not do that every fucking time I want to heal Great I Gotta put on the poison thing, too
[121:00.22]Four?
[121:00.52]Holy Jesus Christ.
[121:07.11]No!
[121:07.61]Oh, God, you fucking asshole.
[121:13.45]Oh, this guy sucks.
[121:18.94]Alright, he does that twice.
[121:28.31]I'm having more trouble with this guy than fucking O and S. He's just so erratic.
[121:38.30]Look at the guy.
[121:48.08]Come on.
[122:06.36]Got it.
[122:06.72]Alright.
[122:07.16]Woo!
[122:10.60]He's just so erratic.
[122:11.96]His moves are just so like, wag, wag, wag, wag, wag.
[122:15.84]Woo!
[122:20.20]He was cool.
[122:24.29]30,000 souls.
[122:30.83]And now there's another door.
[122:34.33]Let me go this way first.
[122:40.37]Because I want to, uh, you know.
[122:44.81]Wait, the DLC's not, don't tell me that.
[122:46.39]The DLC's not over.
[122:47.89]No way.
[122:53.13]I need 2,000 more souls, which I don't even know if I can do.
[122:57.37]I think I have one more.
[122:58.27]Yes, I do.
[122:58.73]Thank God.
[123:01.77]Thank you for playing the Dark Souls DLC.
[123:05.37]We added a boss.
[123:06.93]I hope you like it.
[123:09.52]Probably put my armor back on too.
[123:19.42]Although I really do like moving around faster.
[123:21.62]Batrolling and midrolling just... It's harder to avoid stuff.
[123:34.11]Okay, what do we got?
[123:49.26]Olis Isle Sanctuary.
[123:50.47]Okay.
[123:51.89]Bonfire here.
[123:59.71]Let me just grab items first.
[124:03.56]I don't see any items.
[124:05.26]But, you know.
[124:11.08]Whoa, whoa!
[124:13.38]Oh, whoa!
[124:13.96]There's a friendly mushroom person.
[124:18.14]Hold on, nothing else here?
[124:19.08]I think we're talking to the mushroom.
[124:28.08]Let me guess, there's a mushroom in the Wall Covenant.
[124:30.50]Well, look at this one.
[124:32.62]From what faraway age hast thou come?
[124:35.90]Thy scent is very human indeed, but not intolerable.
[124:41.01]Ah, Princess Dusk's savior.
[124:44.35]Thine aura is precisely as she described.
[124:47.64]How many persons stuck in wall covenants are there in this game?
[124:52.12]But Princess Dusk is here no longer, snatched away by that horrifying primeval human.
[124:59.39]And so I must ask, couldst thou once more play the savior?
[125:03.79]This is like three.
[125:06.45]Do I want to be the savior?
[125:10.22]Everyone is so vague.
[125:13.65]How vague can you get?
[125:14.69]Are you going to save?
[125:20.43]Are you saving everything?
[125:23.37]I mean, yes.
[125:25.38]You just always say yes.
[125:26.98]Well, that was fairly straightforward.
[125:34.74]That one wasn't vague at all.
[125:38.62]Alright, what do you got?
[125:41.93]Repair powder, gold pine resin.
[125:43.51]That's pretty sick.
[125:44.27]I'm going to buy the gold pine resin.
[125:48.61]How much does she have?
[125:54.59]Might as well.
[125:54.99]May the flames guide thee.
[125:59.68]Well, does this do anything else?
[126:02.86]Thou shalt see further on.
[126:05.34]An abyss was begat of the ancient beast and threatens to swallow the whole of Oolacile.
[126:12.05]Knight Artorias came to stop this.
[126:15.21]But such a hero has nary a murmur of dark.
[126:18.45]Without doubt, he will be swallowed by the abyss.
[126:22.09]Overcome by its utter blackness.
[126:24.57]Indeed, the abyss may still.
[126:27.84]Princess Dusk needs to be rescued.
[126:29.68]So we're going to rescue a princess.
[126:33.32]We have a bonfire here.
[126:35.78]I'm going to put my armor back on.
[126:45.68]Where is it?
[126:49.94]Where's my... There it is.
[126:53.12]Stone armor.
[126:54.14]Let's make sure we don't go overboard here.
[127:00.01]The whole stone set is on.
[127:02.79]Okay.
[127:03.07]Alright, let's do it.
[127:16.19]Uh... I don't... I don't want to... Because... I don't... How far... What's the next area here?
[127:24.25]Because... Am I going to sit at this?
[127:25.65]Because I don't want to... I'm trying to... What I'm trying to say is... The bonfire is right behind this one.
[127:33.82]And I already kindled it.
[127:37.24]So why would I kindle that one?
[127:38.51]Why would I sit at that one?
[127:42.17]Didn't I kindle the one before it?
[127:48.76]sit at it you can warp you I know I'm just saying like everyone gives me for doing what I just did there's a bonfire right behind here and I kindled it and then like everybody in the chat goes like why what have you done yeah you kindled that yeah somebody get into his house and put their hands around his neck until he turns purple
[128:19.01]Alright, new zone.
[128:19.75]We're at the Funny Swamp 2.
[128:22.88]You got it.
[128:27.00]Royal Wood.
[128:30.06]This just looks like a higher brightness basin.
[128:34.92]Oh boy, there's Jack Skellingtons.
[128:37.62]Okay.
[128:41.38]One hit.
[128:45.99]Let's go the way they came.
[128:53.85]Okay, we're back up.
[128:57.86]This is the downloadable content area.
[129:03.48]I see more of those dudes over there.
[129:04.95]Oh, my back hurts.
[129:07.59]I need someone just to Yokozuna on my back.
[129:14.66]Does it look familiar?
[129:15.44]It kind of does.
[129:25.38]Hmm, this does look familiar, doesn't it?
[129:31.98]I like the, this, I like the way this place looks better.
[129:34.00]Alright, we got more of these, like, pumpkin people.
[129:41.17]Oh boy, don't get collapsed on here.
[129:42.83]Holy shit.
[129:43.97]Okay, easy.
[129:45.65]Easy.
[129:46.53]Easy.
[129:50.31]Oh man, they're just, they're running over here, aren't they?
[129:59.02]Okay, hold on.
[130:04.26]Gotta isolate you.
[130:09.28]What the fuck was that?
[130:11.04]Did something just come out of the ground?
[130:12.30]No, it was his hammer.
[130:14.73]I thought like a snake came out of the ground.
[130:16.91]God damn it.
[130:21.91]He pulls it back up.
[130:23.61]Of course he does.
[130:35.05]So far, so good.
[130:37.30]Item.
[130:41.22]Killing landscapers?
[130:44.02]What the hell are they doing out here?
[130:45.10]There's a bridge over here on the left.
[130:58.39]Okay.
[131:05.09]What?
[131:06.49]Oh.
[131:09.81]It's toothless.
[131:12.73]I know what movie I'm in.
[131:13.81]That's the DLC.
[131:17.45]It's How to Trade Dragons.
[131:23.52]Don't give me minuses for that one.
[131:28.62]Fuck.
[131:31.14]I got it?
[131:32.56]Got it.
[131:33.00]Twinkly Titanite.
[131:49.87]Big.
[131:51.07]Huge.
[131:52.73]Guy.
[131:54.56]Twinkling Titanite.
[131:55.36]Nice.
[131:57.46]Wow again, but not, you know, you can't follow up with that.
[132:01.66]That's not that impressive.
[132:03.00]You should have came in first.
[132:04.64]And then he should have came in after.
[132:06.70]He really blew that one.
[132:07.58]Sorry, dude.
[132:08.62]I'm assuming that's a boss.
[132:10.29]I have to fight that thing?
[132:11.09]I guess.
[132:17.23]Here are all of his feathers.
[132:27.07]I can hear him.
[132:27.87]Are we, like, above his grotto or something?
[132:34.07]I see a birdcage over there.
[132:35.65]That's definitely a birdcage.
[132:37.21]So we're not going over there yet.
[132:38.57]Hold on.
[132:41.89]God fucking damn it.
[132:43.01]I saw it.
[132:55.45]I saw it and, like, I thought there was enough room.
[132:57.57]I just... Whatever.
[132:59.37]I have to kindle this.
[133:00.79]I ain't doing... I ain't... Yeah, I ain't... Mm-hmm.
[133:03.39]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[133:04.59]Sorry.
[133:06.25]We're kindling this thing.
[133:10.64]Don't... God damn it, Xbox controller.
[133:13.54]Why are you such a piece of crap?
[133:22.72]Okay.
[133:30.94]I might actually Kindle this to 15.
[133:33.46]Do I have enough to do that?
[133:35.17]Kindle.
[133:41.15]Yeah.
[133:43.03]Yeah, I'm gonna.
[133:46.43]I did not die to Pinwheel.
[133:50.05]Do not spread false information.
[133:51.76]I didn't die to Pinwheel.
[133:53.08]I beat him first try.
[133:54.06]It takes three swings to kill him.
[134:01.14]Kindle to 20?
[134:01.86]Can I Kindle to 20?
[134:04.56]I don't think I need to do 20.
[134:05.50]I think 15 is alright.
[134:17.31]Just do it?
[134:20.96]I don't think I need to do it to 20.
[134:22.28]No, I'm not going to Kindle to 20.
[134:25.26]I'm going to do this with 15.
[134:25.86]Okay.
[134:27.86]Because then nobody can say, well, you know, he did that area, but he did kindle to 20.
[134:36.45]There's no reason not to?
[134:38.31]Well, I... There's no reason not to while you're human.
[134:45.83]He did kindle to 15.
[134:47.79]Alright, you know what?
[134:48.31]We're kindling to 20.
[134:48.95]Because fuck it.
[134:54.28]Damn it, man.
[134:55.50]I can't catch a fucking break.
[134:57.44]Alright, yeah.
[134:58.22]Kindle to 20.
[135:08.49]Get it to 20.
[135:09.83]Why not?
[135:12.33]I'll have 20 Estus flasks.
[135:18.99]There you go.
[135:19.91]Look at this guy.
[135:22.17]This guy has... That seems like so much.
[135:27.81]I've never experienced having that.
[135:29.95]And Bloodborne, maybe.
[135:32.25]But even still, Bloodborne... 20 feels like a lot for Dark Souls.
[135:41.29]Alright, let's do this slow.
[135:43.67]Go back to where we were.
[135:44.43]20 Estus.
[135:50.61]LOL.
[135:54.88]It's fine.
[135:57.84]It's gonna be fine.
[136:06.69]How many times did he kindle?
[136:08.01]Oh my god.
[136:08.63]I can't fucking believe it.
[136:17.33]Watch out.
[136:18.05]They jumped down.
[136:19.35]The whole field of the poppy fields, right?
[136:22.25]They all come down here.
[136:25.07]Let's make quick work of these two.
[136:28.71]And then big guy comes over too.
[136:32.19]There he is.
[136:35.95]Really, really wish I didn't have to confirm that.
[136:40.85]Damn it.
[136:41.13]Didn't want to dodge.
[136:51.92]Great.
[136:54.92]I'll take the Titanite, though.
[136:58.86]I will take that.
[137:01.29]Where did I fall down?
[137:01.97]It's over here somewhere, right?
[137:07.57]The dragon comes down and scares you?
[137:09.13]Yeah.
[137:14.86]Does he do it again?
[137:15.40]Or is that just a one-time deal?
[137:17.78]What if you were looking down or something?
[137:20.36]That's unfortunate.
[137:21.02]He should come every time.
[137:23.38]What happens if you weren't paying attention?
[137:25.16]Like your mom calls or something and you look down and you never get to see that ever again.
[137:35.34]It sucks to be you then.
[137:39.92]Well then, too bad.
[137:41.28]Alright, this is where I fell.
[137:44.34]The guy comes over here though, see?
[137:46.04]Two people come over here.
[137:48.76]Oh shit.
[137:51.18]I was trying to be cheeky.
[138:00.05]Alright, stop.
[138:00.94]Good thing I did those 20 Estuses, because I'm trying to be so cute here.
[138:14.56]Alright, let me ask you guys something.
[138:16.55]This is important, okay?
[138:18.45]So let's just say... Let's just say that I was a streamer.
[138:23.31]Not me.
[138:24.11]Not like Jerma985.
[138:26.77]And I got to Pinwheel...
[138:29.33]And I had a lot of trouble with Pinwheel.
[138:32.05]And I died to Pinwheel.
[138:34.62]What, um... What would you guys say in that chat?
[138:40.28]What would happen?
[138:42.50]Would you, like, tell that person that they're terrible?
[138:46.79]What would happen?
[138:48.85]What would you guys... What, you guys gonna get banned from a chatroom?
[138:52.33]Is that what's gonna happen?
[139:02.32]Yeah, yes.
[139:03.14]Is that worth getting banned from a chat?
[139:09.34]You know, other streamers may not be as tolerant as I am.
[139:14.96]What happens if you tell some streamer that they suck?
[139:16.60]What's going to happen to you?
[139:19.48]Never forget my tolerance.
[139:21.82]And how I got the nuke on my finger.
[139:24.17]Alright, I don't want to fall off.
[139:39.82]Don't fall.
[139:40.66]Jesus Christ.
[139:45.82]So, my point is that don't spread me dying to pinwheel to anybody.
[139:51.98]Otherwise, we might see the end of that.
[139:54.52]I'll do chatless streams.
[139:55.84]Don't fall.
[140:01.13]Seriously, stop it.
[140:02.07]Okay, enough.
[140:07.79]Dictator.
[140:18.11]Your bad forehead.
[140:20.45]Alright, I need to pay attention because I'm going to get eaten by that fucking dragon.
[140:27.04]We're going to the rabbit cage.
[140:34.06]Alright.
[140:34.94]That way.
[140:36.72]Huge congregation of people over here.
[140:40.49]Oh, fuck.
[140:43.91]Got it.
[140:46.87]Alright, we got a law.
[140:47.92]I gotta do this smart.
[140:52.42]That's smart.
[140:55.42]Isolate the big guys.
[140:56.18]Gotta get rid of him quick and first.
[141:04.97]Didn't think I'd do that.
[141:08.45]Come on, before he gets over here, he's gotta go!
[141:17.49]He dropped something though, what is this?
[141:18.63]I hear a guy!
[141:23.47]Is there- is he- where is this dragon?
[141:27.44]I heard the dragon.
[141:28.02]Did he spray fire or something?
[141:29.08]Like stone fire?
[141:29.88]Did he spray dust fire at me?
[141:31.94]You know what I'm trying to say.
[141:32.78]I heard it.
[141:38.82]Two in a row, come on dude.
[141:42.94]I'm just panicking.
[141:49.52]I'm gonna fucking walk in here and die.
[141:50.80]I'm gonna walk through this thing and get, gosh darn it, I'm gonna die.
[141:55.08]Not going over there yet.
[142:00.05]There's an item over here.
[142:02.89]Scared the shit out of me.
[142:09.09]These guys just... They are landscaping.
[142:13.74]You guys were not kidding.
[142:14.60]They actually are doing that.
[142:19.22]We're just clipping the trees.
[142:25.43]Gold coin.
[142:26.13]I guess we're going in that building and down.
[142:29.29]If I were to take a guess.
[142:34.43]Anything else?
[142:41.37]Got lucky there.
[142:44.07]Got lucky there again.
[142:47.81]Up there...
[142:51.63]Don't want to go down that way.
[142:54.13]$50.
[142:54.39]We got $50 from Lorag.
[142:57.80]Lorag98, thank you so much for the 50 bucks.
[143:02.36]50.
[143:04.36]They say, GermanNA5, isn't that the guy who lost a pinwheel on stream?
[143:07.54]I think I'll watch somebody else.
[143:13.15]You see, thank you for the $50, Lorag.
[143:15.87]I appreciate it.
[143:16.57]It's a lot of fucking money.
[143:18.03]But here's the thing.
[143:19.25]Um,
[143:20.89]I got documented proof.
[143:22.27]I have evidence that what you said is not true.
[143:25.45]You know?
[143:25.89]See, you guys can't go in and doctor anything.
[143:27.67]I got the original raw data.
[143:29.29]I got the raw footage of me walking into that bonfire.
[143:34.28]First try.
[143:38.84]It's doctored.
[143:39.56]It's not doctored.
[143:42.00]You were here.
[143:42.62]I want that item.
[143:52.34]How do I get that item from there?
[143:54.50]I want it.
[143:54.84]I know I just like lost potential progress here, but I want that item.
[144:09.79]Oh my fucking god, no!
[144:26.07]Come on.
[144:26.71]That's just not even fair.
[144:28.96]I'm gonna need one.
[144:40.76]Whatever.
[144:46.03]Look down.
[144:46.75]Well, I just... I didn't know it was gonna be right there.
[144:50.13]There's no... You have to lose to that to know it's there.
[144:53.03]Ugh.
[144:57.45]Running blindly around corners.
[144:58.89]Hey, what did you do there?
[145:00.23]Did you jump over that?
[145:01.23]How much Mercury did you eat today?
[145:17.63]This is dangerous.
[145:19.57]This is a very bad idea.
[145:20.63]But it's going to work.
[145:22.93]Just bear with me here.
[145:41.07]Alright, they're not following anymore.
[145:41.99]We're fine.
[145:46.35]Now which fucking fish did you eat last night?
[145:53.55]I'm getting that.
[145:57.70]I can't go that way.
[146:04.68]Hey, what's that old saying?
[146:05.42]Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house?
[146:10.58]Seen a lot of windows with you guys.
[146:12.60]Seen a lot of glass windows around here.
[146:14.43]Alright, let's go back right here.
[146:26.07]Just don't fall into the hole.
[146:27.57]Grab your souls.
[146:32.89]It's not very many, but still don't want to lose him.
[146:34.95]Alright.
[146:35.89]Now.
[146:36.91]Let's try this again.
[146:38.41]This time, I'm not going to run.
[146:40.19]I'm going to walk.
[146:46.18]Fucking dumb game.
[146:47.16]Why?
[146:48.38]How did that happen?
[146:49.94]How did that?
[146:50.44]I very clearly made that jump.
[146:52.38]That was so clear.
[146:53.24]It was as clear as day.
[146:54.66]You all saw how fucking clear eyes...
[147:08.78]I made that jump.
[147:11.52]You could tell me I didn't over and over again.
[147:15.16]And I'll tell you I did.
[147:20.82]I have to get this worthless item.
[147:25.33]Yeah, bring Ben Stein over here and get him to fucking take a look.
[147:35.77]He's refuting reality now.
[147:38.09]I made that.
[147:39.21]I was very careful.
[147:41.36]I was perhaps too careful and that was the problem.
[147:51.68]The pinwheel of jumps.
[147:57.67]He's gonna lose it.
[147:58.65]No, I'm fine.
[147:59.81]I'm totally fine right now.
[148:01.13]I'm relaxed.
[148:03.81]Just I'm just chillin here playing Dark Souls remastered um, everything's going well.
[148:08.48]I'm doing well.
[148:09.86]How are you?
[148:18.04]Almost there Narrator he was not fine Everything's gonna be just fine
[148:34.57]Okay, here we go Stay away Don't okay fine.
[148:45.82]Alright, let's I gotta get rid of these guys actually because they're gonna cause a problem Okay Get the souls do it again.
[149:00.47]Oh
[149:05.83]Take off some of the gear.
[149:09.03]So you weigh less.
[149:12.39]Just do it.
[149:14.32]I'm overthinking it now.
[149:15.26]I'm overthinking it.
[149:16.24]Just go.
[149:18.92]Okay.
[149:19.68]Good for you.
[149:20.18]Okay.
[149:21.58]It's the big guy's helmet.
[149:23.68]So it was worth getting that, I think.
[149:25.04]Let's take a look at it.
[149:25.71]Is that guy pointing over here?
[149:28.71]That guy's waving at me.
[149:31.87]What?
[149:32.01]What?
[149:34.36]He doesn't come all the way over here, does he?
[149:40.16]He's going to fall in the hole.
[149:43.08]No.
[149:43.58]Is he?
[149:44.06]I'm so confused.
[149:44.88]Alright.
[149:45.10]Let's see how much difference.
[149:49.37]Stone Helm.
[149:51.05]Guardian Helm.
[149:54.05]I mean, this thing's pretty good.
[149:56.81]It's an improvement almost in every single way, besides the fire defense.
[150:14.70]Are you fucking kidding me?
[150:15.56]Could I have walked this the whole time?
[150:18.38]No.
[150:18.72]Okay.
[150:22.10]I made this game.
[150:26.52]Why is that like the thing that people say?
[150:31.97]Why is that the thing that people say?
[150:33.77]Oh, I'm nice.
[150:37.59]I made this game.
[150:40.15]I want that item too.
[150:44.49]See, one of these days, it's going to be real.
[150:45.99]That's not going to be a lie.
[150:47.63]I'm not going to fight him.
[150:52.51]I just want the item.
[151:00.29]Some great arrows.
[151:01.27]There's items over here, too.
[151:02.65]Did I just jump into that?
[151:05.47]Get out of here, dude.
[151:08.72]Dude, I'm not lying.
[151:09.94]I did.
[151:10.50]Guardian armor.
[151:11.50]Okay, that's probably better than stone armor.
[151:14.40]I have the guardian legs, too.
[151:15.50]Alright, let's make our way back to reality here.
[151:22.54]Alright, now I can slow down.
[151:29.43]No, they're still following, aren't they?
[151:37.11]Snip!
[151:40.71]Okay.
[151:43.09]Things are looking up.
[151:45.39]This way or that way?
[151:46.13]Let's go that way.
[151:52.09]Remember this part with the two guys.
[151:53.77]I kind of want that pitchfork.
[151:58.43]It's not going to do very much for me, but it's still... I want it for the aesthetic reason only.
[152:05.84]Clear this out.
[152:12.28]That's definitely an item these guys drop, right?
[152:13.82]It has to be.
[152:21.33]Pitchfork.
[152:24.19]Too bad.
[152:28.67]Okay.
[152:28.85]To the bird fortress.
[152:31.31]Post haste.
[152:35.31]There's a fortress over there, too.
[152:36.79]No, I gotta clear it.
[152:37.97]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[152:39.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[152:44.59]Over there on the right, that's probably, I'm gonna say a bonfire, maybe?
[152:46.85]Oh, fuck.
[152:51.77]That was lucky.
[152:57.51]Shit.
[153:00.19]Oh, shit.
[153:01.29]Oh, shit!
[153:03.69]Oh!
[153:08.15]Will you please just give me a moment?
[153:17.64]Alright.
[153:18.14]God.
[153:21.54]Let's go in the house.
[153:25.09]Bonfire.
[153:30.93]I hear twinkling.
[153:33.41]Is there a cookie bug in here?
[153:35.80]No.
[153:36.36]Wait a minute.
[153:37.72]Where does this go?
[153:38.36]Okay.
[153:45.84]Okay.
[153:51.88]Okay.
[154:00.95]Now, there's another one of these.
[154:02.37]Except this is not here.
[154:10.34]I can't call this elevator or anything?
[154:15.38]Shit.
[154:37.06]There's more places to go.
[154:38.30]That's not a bonfire.
[154:42.04]Is that a lady?
[154:43.16]Is that a person?
[154:43.81]That's not a fire.
[154:44.53]Okay, here's... Here's, like, the guy that hacks your computer.
[154:51.89]What's his name?
[154:52.35]What?
[155:06.49]Everything is a yes in this game, isn't it?
[155:09.13]It's always a yes.
[155:14.34]The Bloodborne guy.
[155:19.58]I didn't get snatched.
[155:30.99]Yes, of course.
[155:32.77]Exactly what happened to me.
[155:34.27]Oh, right, the hand came up.
[155:35.83]Grab me.
[155:37.69]But at least now there are two of us.
[155:43.10]Alright, you got cool things for sale.
[155:46.34]He sells humanities, too.
[155:47.66]Alright, well, might as well buy a bunch of your shit like these.
[155:57.47]Green blossoms are good just to have.
[156:12.91]I already have too many of those.
[156:18.23]So long.
[156:19.37]Nothing else to say?
[156:20.05]Oh, think of anything that you might need.
[156:28.04]Did you happen across Knight Artorias?
[156:30.70]No, I did not.
[156:31.14]The legendary abyss walker from the old tales.
[156:34.76]Well, if you haven't, it's just as well.
[156:36.92]This guy's a scammer?
[156:37.68]He's a colorless sort.
[156:39.04]Oh, well.
[156:39.64]If you ask me.
[156:43.31]So long.
[156:44.03]You're really funny.
[156:45.70]Thanks a lot, funny guy.
[156:46.68]Another elevator.
[156:49.78]Is this, where is this?
[156:57.84]Okay.
[157:01.04]What the fuck is this?
[157:04.12]This is up, buried, died.
[157:15.53]um that's a shortcut where's the to the bonfire I gotta remember where the fuck this is um okay I have to like always make sure that the the coliseum is alright well whatever I got 16 estes can I go up
[157:46.36]Yes, I can.
[157:52.07]Well, there's the gauntlets.
[157:52.87]Alright.
[157:57.43]I want to look at those.
[158:00.29]Guardian armor.
[158:01.57]Wait, don't look at it yet.
[158:02.71]Oh, my God.
[158:10.06]Do I really have to fight you in here?
[158:11.90]I'm going to...
[158:14.24]I'm like stuck on the fucking staircase.
[158:16.88]Holy shit in my fucking pants.
[158:24.48]Come over here.
[158:30.52]Come on, don't... Is there another one here now?
[158:45.43]Oh my god, damn it!
[158:47.21]Get me out of here!
[158:49.17]I want out of here!
[158:51.76]Oh my fuck!
[158:54.86]Okay, where's the bridge?
[158:56.02]I want to make sure I know where I am.
[158:59.86]This is back here.
[159:03.91]That bonfire takes me... I'm just going to find a little house up here.
[159:06.97]Okay, there's the poppy seeds.
[159:15.54]So it actually is like right... It's like right there, isn't it?
[159:23.61]Okay, there it is.
[159:27.29]So there's the bridge, which leads up to here.
[159:30.23]You go straight across and right into the door.
[159:34.93]You got it.
[159:38.69]So that is actually a pretty good shortcut.
[159:43.57]So I'm just going to go sit at the bonfire and get 20.
[159:53.89]That's pretty good.
[160:01.12]Rest.
[160:03.84]Let's go.
[160:06.70]Yeah, it actually is pretty crazy.
[160:07.96]This whole game was just a community mod of Elder Scrolls.
[160:11.24]It's pretty interesting.
[160:14.42]When it takes, like, dedication and map creating, it's really interesting.
[160:23.12]Alright, armor.
[160:23.76]Let's take a look.
[160:27.29]So this is stone or this is guardian.
[160:30.83]Guardian has more magic defense.
[160:32.87]I fucking want to smash this Xbox controller into the ground and have it explode like a firecracker in front of me.
[160:40.45]Alright.
[160:41.89]Uh...
[160:44.83]Actually, not that much better.
[160:48.05]The amount of times I press up on the D-pad or down on the left and right and it just skips.
[160:54.50]It's gonna get me killed.
[161:01.56]It's infuriating.
[161:06.50]Why don't I use my PlayStation controller?
[161:07.92]I tried to use my PlayStation to talk correctly.
[161:13.27]I tried to use my PlayStation controller, but it kept on losing connection.
[161:20.94]For some reason, I tried to do it at first and it wouldn't work.
[161:26.78]I think I can put this on.
[161:28.15]Yeah, I can.
[161:28.61]Can I?
[161:36.43]Guardian Gauntlets.
[161:37.21]Let's take a look.
[161:41.14]Guardian versus Havel.
[161:44.13]Not much of a difference.
[161:45.17]I mean, Havel gives you more poise.
[161:49.01]Oh, I'll keep the stone ones on.
[161:51.07]Do I lose?
[161:52.39]What's the way?
[161:53.23]These weigh exactly the same.
[161:55.11]These have more magic defense.
[161:57.49]Loose fire.
[161:58.09]Whatever, that's fine.
[162:00.43]What about you?
[162:01.85]Guardian legs, same deal.
[162:03.21]Magic.
[162:06.63]61 out of 142.
[162:07.21]I'm still not fat rolling, so that's alright.
[162:12.58]Let's go.
[162:16.88]So if I go this way, and just avoid all these people.
[162:24.36]Just keep going over here.
[162:27.44]This should lead me right to the house.
[162:30.11]And if it doesn't, then boy was I wrong.
[162:35.49]And I was correct.
[162:36.87]Good.
[162:44.85]Did I miss something behind this house?
[162:47.91]I missed something behind that house, but it's too late.
[162:56.23]Let's go.
[163:05.25]I look like I could take three bullets.
[163:09.25]I probably could.
[163:12.13]Hey, what's in the chat right now?
[163:13.33]Dude, I'm such a huge fan of your armor and stuff.
[163:19.01]You're my inspiration for Dark Souls, dude.
[163:22.15]Oh, sorry I killed you.
[163:24.17]I'm sorry that you're dead because I murdered you.
[163:26.17]But thanks for joining the chat, man.
[163:28.61]Welcome to the Germanites, man.
[163:31.19]Pound it, buddy.
[163:36.23]Worth a shot.
[163:41.12]Alright, boss time.
[163:46.18]Who's behind door number three?
[163:54.32]Oh, it's Mr. Pumpkinhead.
[163:55.46]Oh, it's not.
[163:55.96]It's this person instead.
[164:07.18]Oh, dear.
[164:09.89]Okay.
[164:13.97]Oh, fake.
[164:14.57]Fake reaction.
[164:15.53]Fake reaction.
[164:20.65]It's one of those guys from Bloodborne.
[164:29.96]That's pretty cool though.
[164:32.62]Alright, for one- I thought that was me for one second.
[164:38.69]Ooh, okay.
[164:40.29]I'm assuming don't- don't step on the trail he leaves behind him.
[164:45.11]Better take a guess.
[164:52.20]Jesus.
[164:53.08]Alright, he does double- he does like a lot of flips- flipping around.
[165:03.73]Whoa.
[165:04.23]Alright, easy.
[165:10.84]What is that?
[165:16.56]What is that?
[165:17.06]I don't know what to do here.
[165:22.65]Did he just, he like powered himself up?
[165:39.17]You know who this guy reminds me of?
[165:40.13]Oh boy!
[165:44.29]Just drink!
[165:45.25]Just drink as- I have 20 Estus Flasks!
[165:47.97]Oh fuck, I'm dead.
[165:50.91]Alright, so.
[165:52.31]He reminds me of Slave Knight.
[165:57.10]20's not enough.
[165:57.74]I could beat this guy.
[165:58.56]I'm just too busy talking.
[166:04.18]Died with 20 flasks.
[166:05.54]I don't even know what he does for moves!
[166:13.60]I don't know.
[166:16.66]Can parry?
[166:17.44]Yeah, his moves do look very parryable.
[166:22.93]I said five words?
[166:23.83]Yeah, all of them were, do you know who this guy reminds me of?
[166:28.01]And that was enough for me to die.
[166:43.44]I'll try for a parry.
[166:45.42]It seems... Some of his moves are predictable enough where you could probably get a good parry in.
[166:57.19]Make sure you send it back.
[167:00.43]Gotta send it back.
[167:05.52]Do I need motivation for this fight?
[167:06.84]No, but this fight seems pretty cool.
[167:10.05]It's just a straight-up sword fight between two very skilled swordsmen.
[167:19.02]I just happen to be wearing a giant turtle shell.
[167:20.94]Okay, let's try it.
[167:30.41]No, that didn't work.
[167:34.22]Oh boy, you're not very good at this, are you?
[167:39.77]Can't parry that.
[167:45.28]Are you sure?
[167:48.92]What?
[167:50.50]Are we sure about this?
[167:52.54]Are we sure about this?
[167:54.62]Some of those look pretty good.
[168:01.47]So I was lied to.
[168:02.49]Okay, well thanks for lying to me.
[168:05.89]Some of those looked really good.
[168:14.57]Good thing I have 20 Estus Flasks.
[168:19.53]I like this fight, though.
[168:20.31]This is cool.
[168:26.65]Okay, he's doing that thing again.
[168:29.26]Probably can get damage on him here, but I'm not going to risk it.
[168:36.46]Well, I tried to dodge and nothing happened.
[168:38.86]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[168:41.87]He threw sand in my face.
[168:42.79]That's fucking cheating.
[168:52.89]Ooh, that slash.
[168:56.45]Wow!
[169:03.83]He poised, motherfucker!
[169:12.61]He's doing it again.
[169:13.31]Shit!
[169:15.51]Wait, he goes even more?
[169:17.35]Is he going faster and faster and faster now?
[169:24.79]Probably.
[169:34.35]One.
[169:35.76]Just one?
[169:39.12]Oh, easy here.
[169:57.11]He's doing it again.
[169:57.77]I feel like I should be doing something here.
[170:03.43]Now he's like quadruple speed.
[170:18.33]Oh, sand bullshit here, man.
[170:19.49]Come on.
[170:35.10]Ah!
[170:35.26]I didn't get it.
[170:38.92]No!
[170:55.75]I'm being so, like, scared.
[171:05.85]Ow.
[171:07.91]Do the flip again, come on.
[171:13.94]No, back it up here.
[171:17.44]Holy shit.
[171:26.19]No!
[171:26.29]Wrong time, again!
[171:33.47]Damn it!
[171:34.31]Again!
[171:34.77]Fuck me!
[171:36.10]One more hit, come on.
[172:02.52]Get out!
[172:04.23]Alright.
[172:05.11]Did it.
[172:10.01]That was a cool fight.
[172:10.79]I like that one.
[172:13.73]Good thing I had the extra 50.
[172:15.45]Greg, 15 ecstasies.
[172:20.94]That was cool.
[172:22.48]He's probably like the cool... That was a cool fight.
[172:26.00]50,000 souls too, damn.
[172:32.65]What level am I?
[172:34.51]Uh... 75?
[172:38.67]That was the fake boss?
[172:39.65]I'm sure that probably is.
[172:40.65]Alright, let's go.
[172:55.48]Can only go one way, right?
[173:03.82]Oh, Jesus.
[173:04.76]So the real boss is right here.
[173:06.04]Hmm.
[173:20.98]How did this guy beat Dark Souls 3 and not Dark Souls 1?
[173:23.98]One came before 3.
[173:26.07]Alright, let's just sit here.
[173:34.13]Alright, we can do 40 Endurance.
[173:35.39]Let's go back to... Let's get it to 40.
[173:38.11]40, 40.
[173:38.61]Let's do Vitality from here on out.
[173:41.81]Do I have any... One is smaller than three!
[173:56.12]What do I need now?
[173:58.50]One more of those should do the trick.
[174:05.39]Will it?
[174:12.52]Yeah, good.
[174:14.42]Alright.
[174:16.94]Level design is harder in Dark Souls 1.
[174:18.48]Bosses are harder in Dark Souls 3.
[174:20.85]I would definitely agree with that.
[174:25.27]I would 100% agree that the Dark Souls 1 bosses are easier than Dark Souls 3.
[174:30.57]Hold on, let me get back here, though.
[174:37.85]But Dark Souls 3 was just relentless.
[174:41.00]You take a look at like Pontiff, Sullivan.
[174:43.64]Like just absolutely fucking relentless bosses.
[174:47.44]Dancer, Pontiff.
[174:49.62]Even Slave Knight Gale was like that too.
[175:01.27]Enter the gazebo.
[175:05.60]Nameless King.
[175:06.24]Yeah, it was Purple Coward's Crystal.
[175:09.96]What in the name of God am I?
[175:19.82]There's like a lot of things.
[175:21.54]Battle of Stoicism is only available online.
[175:25.08]Duels are 1v1.
[175:26.00]Oh, this is the... Okay, this is the... This is the PvP area.
[175:32.21]Windstreak resets to... Okay, PvP.
[175:37.76]Deathmatch.
[175:38.56]Okay, yeah.
[175:39.04]This is PvP.
[175:43.60]Although I can go this way, too.
[175:49.11]I felt the same way about Demon's Souls, too.
[175:50.77]Demon's Souls, the bosses weren't a big problem as much as the areas were.
[175:56.19]Now, Demon's Souls had a couple of really, really difficult bosses.
[175:59.39]But in the grand scheme of things, I mean, even in Bloodborne, too.
[176:04.37]Bloodborne's bosses, some of them in the DLC...
[176:08.20]Orphan is fucking insane.
[176:11.11]I've never spent more time on a boss than Orphan.
[176:14.97]It's almost like they just dialed up to a thousand.
[176:19.45]What is this?
[176:24.05]This door is locked.
[176:30.78]This is a long fall.
[176:45.16]Let's go here.
[176:52.13]Lawrence sucks.
[176:54.65]I think the most trouble I had in any of these games was by far with Orphan.
[176:58.41]Orphan and... I mean, I guess the correct answer is probably Paunt of Sullivan.
[177:07.18]when he splits into two and you just just just why don't you guys watch the whole thing uh how I I died to pontiff like 15 or 16 times didn't I pontiff can be parried that's true but you know orphan was easy
[177:36.24]Alright, well, we're just going to keep going further here.
[177:45.89]Oil Asylum of Township.
[177:51.13]Everyone's yelling, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[177:54.63]Um, okay.
[177:55.95]I will go back.
[178:00.33]Pontiff just punishes.
[178:04.43]The best boss fight in the whole series was Gale, for sure.
[178:09.41]It just was.
[178:10.27]That was the most heart-pumping.
[178:13.35]It wasn't unfair.
[178:15.71]It was just awesome.
[178:17.43]That whole fight was incredible.
[178:18.67]That's definitely the best fight of the whole series.
[178:21.27]So far.
[178:23.47]Let's go back to here.
[178:27.00]Ludwig as well.
[178:27.96]Ludwig is one of my favorite boss fights ever.
[178:32.49]But not because of the encounter, but just because of the character.
[178:35.85]He was really, really cool.
[178:38.69]Alright, but fight mechanics-wise, Gale was by far my favorite.
[178:46.59]So if I go all the way back to the beginning of this area... Is this an item or something people were saying?
[178:54.41]Back to the start of this whole zone.
[179:01.48]Just reload in the boss area.
[179:11.17]I know, what an idiot.
[179:12.05]He didn't know you had to reload in the boss room?
[179:16.64]How come he hasn't beaten this game 30 times like I have?
[179:20.10]Unbelievable!
[179:38.63]There's a person here.
[179:39.51]Hi.
[179:42.79]Hi, new person.
[179:43.61]Top ten streamers that are idiots.
[179:46.37]Alright, so I can give her the soul, and I don't get his cool weapon, but
[180:07.21]Maybe she gives me something fun.
[180:10.81]Crush the soul in front of her.
[180:23.04]Eat it in front of her.
[180:24.44]And then hold down R2.
[180:31.00]Really, don't.
[180:31.60]No, yeah, I guess...
[180:35.44]Again, I'm in the room with the poisoned food in front of me, and people are all screaming at me to eat it.
[180:43.37]I'm going to give it to her.
[180:48.35]Thank you.
[180:48.69]You can have it.
[180:49.81]You are very kind.
[180:51.34]Please take this.
[180:53.34]I no longer need it.
[180:57.28]Ooh.
[180:58.98]May the Lord guide thee.
[181:01.54]Thank you.
[181:07.88]Those are definitely dex weapons, but these are the dancer weapons, aren't they?
[181:12.89]S scaling with dexterity.
[181:14.13]Holy God.
[181:19.19]A and S scaling.
[181:22.77]Curve sword used by the Lord's blade.
[181:26.01]Kyarian.
[181:27.25]One of Lord Gwyn's four knights.
[181:30.03]This is the dancer weapon.
[181:31.89]Nice.
[181:35.85]Poison and gold.
[181:41.36]Alright, well there you go.
[181:42.44]There it is.
[181:44.00]Now kill her.
[181:55.38]Don't!
[181:59.60]Do it!
[182:00.00]Do it!
[182:01.79]She's in the perfect position for me to do the execution.
[182:09.90]This is the one time that I'm going to make the decision for myself.
[182:14.98]Are you ready?
[182:19.04]You humans.
[182:20.84]Always taking what you please.
[182:23.48]Then I shall do the same.
[182:51.67]Just get dumped on, for real.
[182:54.68]Alright, now we got 10,000 souls.
[182:56.62]We got whatever she dropped.
[183:00.50]Look at this!
[183:02.56]We get her clothes!
[183:06.29]That's not gonna be... Tell me the truth.
[183:07.95]Did I just fuck everything up for myself?
[183:18.96]Okay, good.
[183:20.76]Wait, wait, wait, where is it?
[183:23.38]Shadowgarb, what was it called again?
[183:24.64]It was Blue Lord's Blade Robe.
[183:28.76]Oh.
[183:29.84]A robe common to all the Lord's Blades, these deadly women shift nimbly between layers of darkness.
[183:35.01]Streaks of gold into the air.
[183:37.15]No super secret reason to put it on.
[183:39.65]Okay, what about the helmet?
[183:45.59]The Cyclops headpiece is common to all Lord's Blades.
[183:48.91]The mask is lined with ivory locks of hair.
[183:50.83]It's a unique mask.
[183:51.99]It's just decoration.
[183:52.85]It doesn't do anything.
[183:54.95]This thing sucks.
[183:59.40]What do you mean best helmet?
[184:00.58]That thing's terrible.
[184:10.33]No.
[184:10.99]Get this thing out of here.
[184:13.29]I'm not wearing the fucking Star Wars helmet.
[184:15.13]No.
[184:17.21]We're going back to Stone Man.
[184:21.99]Alright, let's go.
[184:25.20]Fashion is everything.
[184:26.50]Yeah, well, I want to be this guy.
[184:30.36]Alright, we're going back here.
[184:31.76]Straight away this way.
[184:32.86]Next part of the DLC.
[184:33.90]I feel like we're getting close.
[184:47.54]Go down, go down, go down.
[184:49.80]Go down, down, go!
[184:51.84]I'm just- this is just Twitch tells their dog what to do.
[185:04.91]Sit.
[185:05.47]Fetch.
[185:06.33]Good boy.
[185:07.51]Down.
[185:08.11]Down.
[185:08.49]Okay, down.
[185:12.81]They want me to go down.
[185:13.51]Down.
[185:17.11]No, you're going the wrong way.
[185:17.99]Bad dog.
[185:18.61]Bad dog.
[185:19.18]Alright, here we go.
[185:41.15]There's some person down here.
[185:42.79]We're going to go get the item first.
[185:49.53]Wow, what a skilled dog.
[185:51.45]Speaking of dogs.
[185:55.79]There are dogs down here.
[185:57.74]See?
[185:57.94]This is bullshit.
[186:00.16]So I'm not the first dog you've talked to, then.
[186:03.48]You've sent more than one dog down here, guys, haven't you?
[186:06.60]These are other streamers that you screamed at to go down the ramp?
[186:10.12]I see how it is.
[186:25.23]That's it?
[186:27.69]Person?
[186:28.37]No, I thought this was like a kneeling lady.
[186:29.99]It's nothing.
[186:38.71]We're just still going here, aren't we?
[186:46.92]Oops.
[186:49.12]Really?
[186:51.00]I was going to say, that's not possible.
[186:59.58]Well, we both missed.
[187:00.71]We can both be embarrassed at the same time, dude.
[187:04.25]Alright, there's another way to go.
[187:06.01]Straight through.
[187:06.49]I'm assuming this is probably going to bring me to Firelink or something eventually at the end here.
[187:18.30]I mean, there is a... What is that noise?
[187:22.30]I see I almost missed it.
[187:25.30]I almost fucking missed it.
[187:26.80]That's what I'm talking about.
[187:27.58]Why can't they show that again?
[187:29.29]Where's, like, my TiVo feature?
[187:33.37]Where the hell am I?
[187:33.99]It's gonna take forever to climb back up that.
[187:48.14]Oh, shit.
[187:59.02]I fight the guy here, don't I?
[187:59.88]There's a chest back there.
[188:04.24]Can I not aggro the boss yet?
[188:10.90]Just like every other game, when you have three items to pick up in the same spot, something happens there.
[188:19.43]I'm going to get the chest first.
[188:20.40]Is this water safe?
[188:28.96]Yep.
[188:34.47]When does it become not safe?
[188:45.91]Chest.
[188:46.29]Alright, good.
[188:49.72]What's in here?
[188:52.07]Titanite slab.
[189:05.80]Alright, we gotta go.
[189:07.00]Time to go.
[189:08.28]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[189:12.19]Oh, he's coming back to do it again.
[189:32.14]block it.
[189:35.58]Well, I don't know if I can go down there.
[189:43.68]So we're not going to go down that way.
[189:48.05]I'm going to not kindle that yet.
[189:50.13]Let me just take a look.
[189:51.49]Let's just walk down here.
[189:55.67]It's only 13,000 souls.
[189:56.61]Not a big deal.
[189:57.21]I can make those in fucking 10 minutes, dude.
[190:08.57]Get some architecture.
[190:11.85]I got the slab.
[190:12.43]That's all that really matters.
[190:15.54]Now I can level up another item to max, right?
[190:18.92]That's all that matters.
[190:19.88]Elevator.
[190:25.30]Anything else here besides this elevator?
[190:28.15]No.
[190:32.71]People are screaming.
[190:34.01]I can't do anything?
[190:34.89]No.
[190:34.99]Parry the dragon.
[190:36.87]Parry the dragon.
[190:40.27]You can't parry lightning.
[190:52.56]Keep moving.
[190:55.34]Don't jump down there.
[190:56.04]You're going to get yourself in a lot of trouble.
[190:58.04]Just keep moving.
[191:03.28]I haven't even tried.
[191:04.66]I'm not going to try.
[191:05.44]This guy's got magic.
[191:08.04]And I even got hit by it.
[191:10.01]And I knew.
[191:17.41]Check corners, right?
[191:18.35]That's a soul.
[191:21.01]I'm not going to drink this yet.
[191:27.31]Yes, I am.
[191:27.81]What are you talking about?
[191:28.61]Let's get full.
[191:35.66]Hmm.
[191:36.06]Okay.
[191:41.65]I can go all the way around and down.
[191:45.15]Why would I do something like this?
[191:54.20]Only 20 left.
[191:54.72]What do you mean 20?
[192:02.57]Who's screaming?
[192:03.35]I hear like a little kid screaming.
[192:05.77]Where are we?
[192:06.29]Who the fuck is screaming?
[192:23.85]Alright, there's a room in here.
[192:25.25]Oh dear, I'm like, I'm lost.
[192:29.95]I'm just getting lost.
[192:34.81]I gotta slow down because this is one of those levels that seems to be sprawling.
[192:37.55]There's a lot of interior, exterior, stairs.
[192:43.37]Oh, for the love of God.
[192:44.97]Somebody already got these items.
[192:55.56]Fuck you.
[192:56.32]Kill him.
[192:58.78]Alright.
[192:59.12]Nothing.
[192:59.80]Nothing.
[193:00.88]And you are not a mimic.
[193:05.38]Dark orb.
[193:06.14]It's a spell.
[193:06.78]I don't have any sorceries.
[193:10.42]Look at how many ways to go.
[193:11.66]I definitely can't do this.
[193:25.02]Might have to come back here later.
[193:25.96]What about out here?
[193:33.12]Kind of?
[193:35.66]Well, okay.
[193:40.95]I'm sorry carving.
[193:47.77]Wait, is this the thing that says I'm sorry?
[193:55.59]Oh, I got it.
[193:56.27]That's the best item in the game.
[193:57.31]Well, it looks like we got... At least we got the best items in the game in here.
[194:14.19]So they replaced those in Dark Souls 3 with... Hey!
[194:19.11]That's the only thing I ever heard.
[194:20.29]Somebody would kill me in an invasion and then do that.
[194:23.07]I've never heard any of the other emotes.
[194:28.85]It kind of sounds like that, actually.
[194:31.41]You're right.
[194:37.35]What is this trying to tell me?
[194:39.01]Let there be light.
[194:45.58]Like, a.k.a.
[194:46.94]a.k.a.
[194:47.26]there's an illusion wall here.
[194:54.46]Oh, fuck.
[194:55.14]Okay.
[194:57.04]There ain't no going back now.
[195:02.91]Oh, shit!
[195:04.77]The lantern!
[195:09.72]Is that what I had to do there?
[195:13.66]I thought it was just a stupid default saying, like, oh, praise the sun, let there be light.
[195:17.94]This guy's gonna fall.
[195:27.57]I can't believe I just got hit.
[195:37.87]I have to use the lantern there.
[195:40.55]Well, shoot.
[195:47.70]This is a mimic.
[195:48.56]Look at that.
[195:49.28]There's no chain.
[195:52.14]Wait, the chain's in the ground.
[195:53.02]You can't tell if it's pointing anywhere.
[196:13.19]Yep.
[196:16.63]I was going to open it.
[196:27.00]This is where you get all these stupid sayings.
[196:36.58]Alright.
[196:38.72]Let's keep moving.
[196:45.14]Dear lord.
[196:45.76]Okay.
[196:46.04]Oh, there's an item right there.
[196:59.87]Hold on.
[197:00.45]Don't get it.
[197:00.91]Don't kill yourself from this.
[197:08.15]This is just back here.
[197:22.21]That was panic, but I got it.
[197:23.79]Soul of a Brave Warrior.
[197:24.79]Let's go light the thing up.
[197:34.27]Alright, lantern.
[197:37.67]Oh!
[197:39.13]Okay.
[197:40.17]Look, lantern.
[197:42.35]Yeah!
[197:42.99]It worked!
[197:44.49]They weren't kidding.
[197:49.55]Silver pendant.
[197:51.60]Whatever that means.
[197:52.30]So what does that do?
[198:13.67]Broken pendant.
[198:16.35]Is it just in here?
[198:18.01]Silver pendant deflects dark.
[198:27.47]Did I go buy it?
[198:28.07]You fucking idiot.
[198:34.61]So do I... What happens if I press square?
[198:39.41]Am I gonna... Can I just use it forever?
[198:44.88]Okay.
[198:49.86]Let's see what it actually is for.
[198:58.85]Okay, silver pennant engraved with Artorias' crest, one of the ancient treasures of Anor Londo, presented to Artorias for facing the Abyss.
[199:05.64]Effectively deflects the dark of the Abyss, especially in its magic forms.
[199:14.08]Okay, so I don't really know what that's supposed to mean, but it's to repel the darkness of the Abyss.
[199:22.15]I will keep that in mind.
[199:23.73]Now let's just keep going.
[199:32.17]And I also have to pee again.
[199:34.36]So don't mind me.
[199:36.20]I'm going to go to the bathroom again.
[199:37.28]Because I've been drinking just like Gatorade.
[199:44.02]Oh, I'm dead.
[199:45.24]I'm dead.
[199:45.72]See, that doesn't matter.
[199:47.10]Time to pee.
[199:53.16]It's a good time for me to stop.
[199:54.08]I'm just holding it in.
[199:55.20]That's the problem.
[199:55.64]You know what I mean?
[199:56.08]I've got to kindle this bonfire.
[199:57.24]Just hold on.
[199:57.90]I'll be right back.
[200:01.96]Go get a snack.
[202:04.94]Hey there.
[202:08.27]Okay.
[202:08.63]Let's bring it back.
[202:19.04]That's the rest of the bonfire.
[202:20.08]Let's rekindle this bonfire.
[202:26.14]Take 2 Humidor.
[202:26.90]I'm just going to give it a 10.
[202:30.66]I like 10 more than I like anything else.
[202:47.12]reverse it and 10. human 20 or you're a try hard elitist no I I'm neither I'm neither one of those things that you just said
[203:12.45]But I want to just do 10.
[203:13.53]I like the number 10.
[203:14.61]I don't like the number 20.
[203:15.39]It gives me anxiety.
[203:17.01]I like 10.
[203:18.40]You know why I like 10?
[203:18.92]Because I feel like I'll overuse it.
[203:21.12]I'll use it as a crutch.
[203:22.64]20 to me is... I'll take extra damage.
[203:25.82]I'll get hit by more things.
[203:26.90]Because I got 20 Estus.
[203:28.14]It's going to be bad in the long run.
[203:36.78]I just got everybody.
[203:37.56]Good.
[203:39.83]Bloated Head.
[203:46.27]I don't like having more health.
[203:47.21]It scares me.
[203:48.29]It does.
[203:48.75]It's scary.
[204:00.15]Where is it?
[204:00.63]Is it not a helmet?
[204:01.19]There it is.
[204:03.39]The bloated head is fissured.
[204:04.72]The cracks lined with immu... tiny red eyeballs.
[204:10.94]With a heart outside and mucus filled inside.
[204:13.18]No sane person could ever wear this.
[204:20.95]Yeah, this looks pretty dumb.
[204:23.83]Are we in emote only mode?
[204:24.97]Are we in sub emote only mode?
[204:26.45]What happened?
[204:28.60]What did you guys do?
[204:37.02]Was chat misbehaving?
[204:38.34]Did I miss something?
[204:40.32]You guys are misbehaving?
[204:41.46]Is that what I've been told?
[204:42.60]He's not dead.
[204:44.54]Let's find our way down.
[204:53.48]Magic.
[205:00.34]Oh, really?
[205:06.07]You've been naughty?
[205:07.85]Stop being so naughty.
[205:08.73]There's somebody just screaming.
[205:10.49]Is it going to be one of those scenarios where I find... Well, this is where I died.
[205:14.23]I don't care.
[205:19.16]I want to progress.
[205:21.41]Let's go down the route to progress through the game.
[205:29.89]Oh, it's this guy.
[205:32.44]He kicks?
[205:33.06]This guy has, like, spin kicks?
[205:38.40]Oh, what the fuck, man.
[205:41.96]Of course you have to... This fucking dumb guy has to be here.
[205:43.98]Okay.
[205:52.75]So here is the bad guy.
[206:01.23]Backstab.
[206:01.68]Come on.
[206:02.04]There it is.
[206:07.94]Why would he be doing this?
[206:11.12]Dark Spirit Marvelous Chester was vanquished and you get to take his hat.
[206:16.83]Or nothing at all.
[206:23.43]actually kind of fucked up that's okay so if I go talk what if I talk to him again I'm assuming if I go speak to him he'll be like oh sorry about that just was testing you that's all we got around the corner I have to fall off onto there but maybe not yet
[206:56.51]I'm going to die down here.
[206:57.33]He's going to get an unusual.
[207:08.56]Oh, that sucks.
[207:09.24]Make sure I don't get... What happens if I block this?
[207:14.29]What does it do?
[207:16.53]It's not that bad.
[207:17.59]I'm just going to block it.
[207:21.59]Go ahead and laugh.
[207:22.17]That's fine.
[207:22.65]I'm not going to fall off here.

[208:08.52]That's an EU reference, by the way.
[208:10.08]There's a bunch of these people in this room.
[208:19.06]Anybody else?
[208:21.38]This looks like a spot in Bloodborne.
[208:29.94]Rubbish.
[208:32.89]Down or up?
[208:35.61]Up first.
[208:42.79]Uh, can't go up first.
[208:44.27]We have to go... Wait, maybe I can.
[208:45.65]No.
[208:49.99]Gotta go down first.
[208:59.98]Safe route.
[209:00.78]I'm not jumping down there.
[209:02.42]That would be a mistake.
[209:05.18]There are so many of these people.
[209:08.60]Not these guys laughing.
[209:10.97]It's gotta be the magicians.
[209:11.77]These guys sound like gremlins.
[209:16.98]Jesus Christ.
[209:20.58]Well, we're gonna have to make it happen at some point, right?
[209:36.55]Illusion?
[209:38.09]Nope.
[209:38.57]Wait.
[209:40.49]I'm going to be doing that so many times now.
[209:46.21]Come on down.
[209:49.24]I really want to get that shortcut wherever it is.
[209:51.28]Alright.
[209:59.98]I'm not going to go that way yet.
[210:02.58]This is to get up.
[210:09.40]Fuck those magicians.
[210:12.40]Somebody's chasing after me.
[210:14.22]I can hear them moving.
[210:17.41]Yep.
[210:21.43]Come on, let them come.
[210:22.19]Come on.
[210:30.35]Another bloated head.
[210:31.27]I'll be selling that to Framped.
[210:33.95]Because why not?
[210:45.66]I'm still going around and up.
[210:49.76]This is taking me every which way here.
[210:53.43]Um... Now what?
[210:58.19]Shit, really?
[210:59.91]Where is this?
[211:00.49]God damn it.
[211:06.97]I'm not gonna go down there yet.
[211:12.71]Can I make this fall over there?
[211:16.28]I think I can.
[211:16.86]Alright, this is a mimic.
[211:28.91]I can tell because the chain is coming after me.
[211:30.95]So, kill.
[211:31.61]I'm being very careful here.
[211:38.52]I'm too far down here to fuck this up.
[211:41.80]Crest Key.
[211:50.82]There was a door that I couldn't open before.
[211:53.74]I wonder if that's the key to open it.
[212:00.28]Even more shit to do.
[212:01.86]Climbing down, going out.
[212:04.74]What's that painting where if you go up the stairs, you go down the stairs and it actually takes you sideways and then around the corner down the stairs?
[212:12.44]What is it called?
[212:12.80]It's a famous math painting.
[212:18.35]I guess I could go down there.
[212:23.89]I don't know about this.
[212:25.41]Whatever.
[212:25.75]You only live twice.
[212:26.49]That's right.
[212:29.43]You get to live two times.
[212:31.19]I don't know why people thought it was only once.
[212:32.49]Humanities.
[212:43.81]I can keep going down.
[212:47.77]I guess so.
[212:49.49]I don't know.
[212:51.63]I'm gonna try.
[212:56.74]Should I jump to this?
[212:58.12]I don't think I need to.
[213:00.38]No.
[213:00.94]Alright, we're here.
[213:04.00]Missed a few items, but, you know, whatever.
[213:05.34]What the fuck are you doing here?
[213:11.38]Night Knight Shard, Dark Fog, which is another spell.
[213:14.13]There's an item out here.
[213:21.59]What in the name of God just hit me for that much damage?
[213:24.35]That was so much damage.
[213:27.19]Why was that extra damage?
[213:31.57]And where's the person that's gonna push me off?
[213:32.99]Okay, easy now.
[213:44.88]I'll get hit by this fucking thing.
[213:46.00]Alright, uh, I guess we're just gonna keep... ...going this way.
[214:00.47]Can he shoot out the window or something?
[214:01.65]He's gonna shoot out the window.
[214:09.68]Wait.
[214:12.06]Elevator?
[214:12.56]Yes!
[214:14.46]Yes, thank God.
[214:16.80]Found the skip.
[214:17.50]Hooray.
[214:22.57]Oh, feels wonderful.
[214:29.81]Go back.
[214:31.43]Use some of these souls.
[214:35.34]And be done with it.
[214:41.68]35,000.
[214:41.78]Let's do HP again.
[214:44.04]I need to use one or two of these.
[214:55.33]Soul of a hero.
[214:56.05]That should do it, right?
[214:56.91]This is 10,000?
[214:57.11]5,000?
[214:57.25]That should do it.
[215:02.61]And it did.
[215:03.05]Okay.
[215:07.63]Uh... I'm gonna kill this again.
[215:12.19]Just because I have it.
[215:19.00]Just because I have it.
[215:24.70]Let's take a look at the key that I picked up as well.
[215:29.68]Crest key.
[215:30.54]Bent crest key.
[215:33.72]Uh, the grooves of the crest are enchanted, the door sealed with a powerful spell.
[215:42.47]So, this opens up the door.
[215:44.77]Back there, I think.
[215:45.83]But I kind of want to... Do I do that first?
[215:51.03]Where was that?
[215:53.17]Where was that door?
[215:58.78]Wasn't it, like, right here?
[216:04.15]I feel like it's here somewhere.
[216:10.79]Am I just completely wrong?
[216:12.89]Probably.
[216:15.35]No, it's right here, right?
[216:18.41]Yeah, this is the right way.
[216:19.09]Let's see what's in here.
[216:25.41]Use the crest key.
[216:29.32]You found the hermit.
[216:39.04]Another giant blacksmith?
[216:43.45]Oh, he's the voice actor.
[216:47.91]He recorded all the sounds.
[216:49.97]Can I get a custom one?
[217:07.01]purchase hello thank you pathmarker Titanite shard he sells all these okay dragons shall never be forgotten that's actually really cool he he's the voice actor and it was rock microphones
[217:33.03]We lost three score of our own.
[217:36.41]Exhilaration.
[217:38.41]Pride.
[217:40.07]Hatred.
[217:41.76]Rage.
[217:43.54]The dragons teased out our dearest emotions.
[217:47.68]Thou will understand one day.
[217:49.68]Dung piled.
[217:50.36]With our twilight, old thoughts return.
[217:54.98]And great waves of nostalgia.
[217:58.33]Please buy my shit.
[218:04.41]Okay, I'm just buying... Can I... I'm gonna... You know what?
[218:06.89]I'll take one.
[218:08.73]You know?
[218:09.43]I'm... I'll take them all.
[218:16.88]Nobody buys this shop.
[218:18.00]This guy needs some money, you know what I mean?
[218:26.30]What happens if I say something to him with his own microphone?
[218:35.89]He sounds much more happy there Black dragon that is causing me lots of pain and suffering.
[218:50.86]Can you stop the black dragon?
[218:52.20]I
[218:59.19]I thought as much.
[219:01.09]He's called Calameet.
[219:02.96]Calameet.
[219:03.58]A voracious dragon indeed.
[219:05.48]Even mighty Anor Londo dared not provoke his ire.
[219:10.36]I see little good coming from this, but my intent is to persevere.
[219:19.25]Sounds like Snape.
[219:22.07]Are you sure that's not Snape with a funny pitch on it?
[219:26.60]Am I going to fight the boss right now?
[219:34.09]I think it's time to fight the boss.
[219:41.81]What is bravery without a dash of recklessness?
[219:46.01]I've taken a liking to thee.
[219:48.21]My best friend.
[219:48.79]I owe thee much for thy service to Artorias.
[219:52.37]Now watch and see how God guides dragons.
[219:59.12]Cool.
[220:01.14]Okay, skip this cutscene.
[220:03.04]Skip the cutscene, right?
[220:03.86]Skip.
[220:04.42]Skip it.
[220:05.06]Skip it.
[220:12.30]He's got a big bow.
[220:21.65]See, this is the coolest shit in Dark Souls.
[220:24.69]Give me more of this.
[220:44.56]Nice shot.
[220:45.36]Nice shot.
[220:52.94]Now go down there and cut his tail off.
[220:58.16]Yes.
[221:00.02]A truer shot was never loosed.
[221:03.32]That bat will be grounded for a good spell.
[221:06.58]Do not disappoint me.
[221:08.64]I await good tidings.
[221:14.49]Dragon slaying.
[221:17.33]Knighthood's highest calling.
[221:21.08]And what are you doing out here, wandering the halls, Mr. Potter?
[221:26.36]Alright, so now I get to go to the dragon?
[221:27.68]He is an ancient dragon.
[221:30.97]Sky would I know.
[221:40.20]This is definitely the best character in the series.
[221:52.93]Now let me go down to where the dragon was and kill him.
[221:58.51]Because he's dead.
[222:00.11]I'm going to go cut his tail off and go sell his organs.
[222:05.85]So let's get out of here.
[222:07.35]That dragon was down.
[222:10.05]Boy, oh boy.
[222:10.88]I don't know.
[222:17.76]He was back.
[222:20.32]Where I... In the swath of water.
[222:29.15]He was like in the very beginning.
[222:30.85]Can I warp to him?
[222:31.65]I hope I can warp there.
[222:40.66]What do we got?
[222:41.38]Warp.
[222:43.41]Daughter.
[222:43.79]Sanctuary.
[222:44.29]Garden.
[222:46.09]Sanctuary.
[222:46.45]Garden?
[222:49.59]It's right here, right?
[222:51.39]No.
[222:51.71]Altar of the Gravelord is Sanctuary.
[222:53.03]Garden.
[222:54.59]I'm pretty sure that's where I need to go.
[223:01.34]Artoria.
[223:02.26]Let's go here.
[223:10.29]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[223:11.79]Why am I here?
[223:13.73]I didn't select this.
[223:17.47]Hold on.
[223:17.77]Did I just get Xboxed?
[223:19.89]Did it select something else?
[223:21.29]I wanted to go... Oh.
[223:33.08]I got Xboxed.
[223:35.57]Oracle Sanctuary.
[223:39.77]I think it skipped over it maybe no that is that was when nito is okay here we go so now from here it was down like the ramp right no you go down the ramp from artorias's boss room
[224:15.76]I was in the right place.
[224:16.86]I just went backwards.
[224:25.22]I'm just trying to remember, like, where it is.
[224:27.48]This place, this world is so fucking huge.
[224:34.97]And then it's down the ramp.
[224:37.85]I'm just gonna walk there, because I know, I can see it in my brain where it is.
[224:43.31]Is this this close?
[224:44.73]This is not even close.
[224:45.75]Yes, it is.
[224:46.54]No, it's not.
[224:47.28]Whatever.
[224:49.72]What was it?
[224:50.12]Sanctuary Town?
[224:52.22]We're just walking.
[224:56.74]We're already walking.
[224:57.80]We're already going there.
[225:07.12]How do I deal with the brain zaps?
[225:08.60]No, it's just too many areas.
[225:15.11]I have the worst sense of direction.
[225:16.42]I agree with you!
[225:19.56]Which is why playing a game where there's 60 locations is hard to remember where everything is.
[225:24.44]Alright, this is- okay, now I remember.
[225:46.59]Now we go down around... Which way was it?
[225:49.61]Down like this side, right?
[225:52.02]Right here.
[225:56.80]You can remember where the 50 states are?
[225:58.72]Yeah, because when I was in the fourth grade... I didn't play Dark Souls every day in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh grade.
[226:09.51]That, like, what are you talking about?
[226:11.88]You learn the 50 states when you're in middle school.
[226:14.82]Because you go over it every day.
[226:18.56]We didn't go over where Anor Londo was in fucking middle school.
[226:28.18]Okay, so remember, when you take the bonfire from here... Oh, yes, we have a hand back there, little Gregory.
[226:33.50]Yes, I'm confused.
[226:35.00]So, when I go from New Londo... That didn't happen.
[226:50.78]Alright, here we go.
[226:51.34]So this is a boss.
[226:56.84]Or is he, like, dead?
[226:58.24]And I just have to, like, pick up his stuff.
[227:00.30]I'm sure we'll find out.
[227:09.37]Where is he?
[227:12.81]He's not as long- I can't just, like, do, like, a jumping slash on him?
[227:18.29]I don't see him.
[227:18.81]Where's his body?
[227:19.53]Whoa, there's a cookie bug right here.
[227:20.79]Yeah.
[227:34.20]What are you going to say about that, huh?
[227:39.32]Still alive.
[227:54.69]Yeah, here's the Mr. Boss dragon.
[227:58.57]Where is he?
[228:01.51]So now he just can, he walks around now.
[228:03.85]Alright, I get it.
[228:04.71]Is he injured?
[228:05.15]Why is he not at like 50% health?
[228:13.72]Oh god, oh god!
[228:14.90]Alright, I'm fine.
[228:17.42]He goes from right to left.
[228:21.54]I don't care.
[228:21.90]Just give me the items first.
[228:22.98]So I don't have to do this anymore.
[228:24.12]Give me the items.
[228:29.56]There's electricity everywhere.
[228:30.96]Any more items?
[228:41.83]There's an item back there.
[228:42.89]Get it.
[228:52.16]Give me the item.
[228:52.92]That's all I care about right now.
[228:53.96]Just give it to me.
[228:57.12]No, okay, wait, wait, I can fight him.
[229:06.69]Can I cut his tail off?
[229:13.29]Wow, that's... Okay, when he goes up in the air, you gotta run.
[229:20.77]No, boy, I'm dead.
[229:30.97]Get out of his way.
[229:37.57]Shit.
[229:38.97]He's kind of blocking my view there.
[229:48.41]What the fuck are you doing to me?
[229:49.68]He's got like a suck move?
[229:53.58]Alright, he's got a lot of moves.
[229:56.56]What does that do to me?
[229:57.90]Why do I have like an RPG status effect?
[230:13.09]Oh my god, I'm so dead here.
[230:20.98]Holy fuck.
[230:23.22]What in the name of god are these moves?
[230:28.60]I just saw... He just did so many new things in a row.
[230:33.25]Okay.
[230:37.17]Go back to the fucking other bonfire.
[230:45.01]He dashes forward and then his tail spits out electricity.
[230:48.05]Alright, so speaking of which, we gotta change this armor for sure.
[230:55.20]I need to be a little bit faster.
[231:03.62]That's not gonna do anything for me though.
[231:04.92]I already have a ton of lightning damage resistance.
[231:13.88]That's a little bit better, but that's stone.
[231:15.58]Is stone the best at lightning resistance?
[231:22.23]Looks like it is so far.
[231:23.19]It just is.
[231:30.59]Not on this apparently.
[231:33.71]Alright, now what can I take off to be down...
[231:44.48]Let me see.
[231:45.44]Boost.
[231:46.16]Defense.
[231:46.60]Physical.
[231:47.20]Fire.
[231:47.78]Curse.
[231:53.14]Miracles.
[231:53.98]Crits.
[231:59.18]Absorbs HP.
[232:00.23]Get this thing out of here.
[232:07.31]What do I have now?
[232:14.30]58 out of 144.
[232:20.74]So, I don't have, like, an electricity ring.
[232:27.35]Nothing I... No ring I can put on puts it up.
[232:31.09]It's fire?
[232:33.53]That's the weirdest looking fucking fire I've ever seen.
[232:37.36]That's fire.
[232:38.34]That's not electric.
[232:43.94]He spits it down on the ground.
[232:46.78]That's fire?
[232:54.17]Callumy doesn't do fire damage.
[232:55.77]Alright, you guys are just fucking trolling me.
[232:57.27]It's magic and... Yeah, give me a break.
[233:00.25]It's not fire.
[233:00.99]I'm trying to get me killed.
[233:03.37]It doesn't matter.
[233:06.04]This is still the best.
[233:09.26]It's magic, not fire.
[233:10.38]Okay, so... Let's go ahead and put on this thing.
[233:19.23]This is a little bit better.
[233:21.93]Havels is better.
[233:23.51]And yes, I'm going to keep saying it like that.
[233:31.77]Yeah, we're going to keep on.
[233:34.53]We're going to use Havels.
[233:36.83]53.
[233:38.22]Magic.
[233:38.66]This is more magic resistance.
[233:43.66]32.
[233:43.72]No, that's probably the best thing I got.
[233:51.16]Guardian legs.
[233:52.60]33 and 32.
[233:52.98]This is way heavier.
[233:55.64]39.
[233:56.38]And I can... Okay.
[233:57.66]35.
[233:57.68]30.
[234:00.62]Where's the... No, let's go back to the 39 one.
[234:06.03]30.
[234:07.41]Actually, that'll... I think I'm gonna keep this on.
[234:10.03]Because that is better defense.
[234:18.71]Although, it doesn't really matter, does it?
[234:24.12]Because I'm still mid-rolling anyways, so... Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[234:30.27]I'll still be mid-rolling.
[234:36.81]The tail gives a greatsword, by the way?
[234:38.45]Okay.
[234:40.43]It's magical and physical, not fire.
[234:41.81]Alright, well, that's fine.
[234:42.79]Here's what we're doing.
[234:43.43]Fifteen!
[234:59.42]Okay, let's go.
[235:02.45]Try it like this.
[235:06.81]Hold on a minute.
[235:07.35]What about... Oh, get the fuck away from me.
[235:09.71]What about shields?
[235:15.66]Lightning.
[235:16.10]80.
[235:16.78]I mean, is it worth trying to block it?
[235:22.64]Probably not.
[235:24.40]That's probably detrimental to my health.
[235:30.61]Probably not.
[235:32.63]Alright, let's go.
[235:39.98]Don't follow me.
[235:40.60]Don't follow me.
[235:41.14]Don't follow me.
[235:42.06]Don't do it.
[235:43.34]Don't follow me.
[235:46.02]Thanks for listening.
[235:53.63]Oh, I... I'm going the wrong way.
[236:04.20]No, where am I?
[236:06.48]Yes, I am.
[236:07.02]This is not the correct way.
[236:08.00]I need to go backwards from here.
[236:10.68]We're not going down to that boss down there.
[236:12.41]We're going across to fight Kalameet.
[236:15.35]We gotta go backwards.
[236:25.18]Might as well sit again.
[236:35.31]Yeah, this is Fashion Souls.
[236:36.73]I'm cosplaying as a Lego guy.
[236:38.21]Alright, get out this way.
[236:47.96]Oh, my back.
[236:50.38]Ugh.
[236:57.14]Royal wood.
[236:58.01]Again, here we are.
[236:58.93]Hold on.
[237:02.71]Oh, my back is in so much pain.
[237:04.29]I don't know what's going on lately.
[237:06.71]But the middle of my back is like somebody is sticking needles into it.
[237:13.76]I don't know why this happens sometimes.
[237:15.08]It's really fucking annoying.
[237:19.93]Getting old, apparently.
[237:24.72]It's not even like a posture thing.
[237:26.36]Sometimes for like three weeks, I have this awful back pain and then it's gone for four years.
[237:31.97]I don't understand.
[237:36.57]Like once like every couple years, I get this like, oh, I can't move.
[237:42.78]What's wrong with me?
[237:46.62]And then I could do a backflip like in a week.
[237:57.09]I'm gonna drink more milk.
[237:58.89]I'm not sure it's milk.
[238:02.86]Alright.
[238:03.60]Let's do it.
[238:07.30]Do a pre-recorded... Do a backflip on stream where this is a pre-recorded stream.
[238:13.80]Alright, I'm ready.
[238:14.26]Let's go.
[238:14.58]Let's go.
[238:14.86]Let's do it.
[238:17.76]I'm gonna be very... I'm gonna be safe and cautious and we're gonna beat Calamity.
[238:23.89]Come on over here.
[238:26.89]Posh is safe.
[238:27.99]Safe!
[238:31.59]I could probably just run by that.
[238:46.02]What are you telling me?
[238:50.14]That's a really electric looking fire.
[238:54.35]Oh fuck.
[238:56.38]Damn it!
[238:58.78]The hitbox on that is huge.
[239:00.38]You just gotta run away.
[239:02.74]Can I take this off?
[239:05.93]Probably can't.
[239:10.39]Oh shit.
[239:24.71]Oh no.
[239:26.17]No, not again!
[239:37.49]What hit me?
[239:39.19]Oh no, here we go again with this shit!
[239:51.14]Oh my god, I just can't see.
[240:00.41]No, fuck.
[240:01.15]What are you doing?
[240:10.46]What the fuck are you doing?
[240:14.18]Give me a break.
[240:21.01]Did I fall down through the water?
[240:22.43]No, god damn it.
[240:34.86]What is with that hitbox, you fucking dickhead?
[240:42.47]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[240:46.53]Oh, come on now.
[240:47.69]Eat my fucking shorts.
[240:49.57]Bart Simpson style.
[240:55.28]Oh, what horseshit?
[240:56.12]Give me a fucking break, game.
[240:57.68]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[240:59.14]What the fuck is this?
[241:00.52]What the fuck is this?! !
[241:02.94]What the fuck is this bullshit?!
[241:06.01]What?!
[241:10.43]Are you fucking kidding me?!
[241:12.45]Do a different move!
[241:14.11]Oh my god!
[241:15.63]Why?!
[241:17.13]Will you do anything else?!
[241:22.52]Oh my fucking god!
[241:23.64]I'm just like locking myself!
[241:25.00]I can't even move!
[241:29.06]I'm stuck in the rock.
[241:31.22]Thank Jesus Christ.
[241:32.54]Baby Jesus.
[241:35.54]Give me a break.
[241:39.93]Oh, fucking God.
[241:50.96]Fuck you, dude.
[242:10.12]Top it off.
[242:10.50]Come on.
[242:24.88]Get out of here.
[242:26.50]Get out of here, dog.
[242:27.10]Get out of here.
[242:28.80]You follow me?
[242:40.25]That was bullshit.
[242:45.21]That, like, I was locked in the corner there with the lightning and the fire and the... Ugh.
[242:55.41]The tail has the best greatsword in the game.
[242:57.17]Y'all, I... You know what?
[242:59.51]My first playthrough, I'd rather... I'd rather just kill the goddamn guy.
[243:05.67]I'd rather he just die.
[243:06.69]Than worry about an item he drops.
[243:17.66]Oh, there's an item still here.
[243:23.64]How many souls do I have?
[243:27.09]1,000?
[243:27.15]Thank god I kindled to 15.
[243:29.11]Yeah.
[243:33.29]So these are that guy's arrows.
[243:34.41]OK.
[243:37.35]So let me see.
[243:38.01]Let's take a look at the ring.
[243:40.90]Calamity ring.
[243:47.96]Alright.
[244:17.53]So is it one of those cases where you take double damage, but you deal double damage to?
[244:24.65]It's only for good players.
[244:29.80]No, it just makes the game harder.
[244:31.18]That's it.
[244:33.28]Alright, so there goes that guy.
[244:34.56]Now let's go down and do the other guy.
[244:36.54]There's another boss down the other way.
[244:39.46]We got the skip for it.
[244:41.04]It's just it's a meme ring.
[244:42.12]Okay, I'm not gonna use the meme ring.
[244:45.23]Now I can take off this ridiculous outfit.
[245:11.35]That's better.
[245:13.68]I should probably just bone out of here.
[245:14.84]Yeah, whatever.
[245:17.84]I have enough bone security.
[245:29.23]The Warthog Warrior.
[245:32.05]Alright.
[245:34.17]Township.
[245:34.67]This is where I want to be.
[245:36.39]Level up.
[245:38.09]Let's get that vitality up.
[245:40.50]Let's do it again, because I have enough to do.
[245:44.78]I didn't get good?
[245:46.10]What do you mean?
[245:47.78]What do you mean I didn't get good?
[245:54.34]You don't think I got good?
[245:57.45]Shit.
[246:00.29]My armor looks like cheese.
[246:02.83]I can see that.
[246:05.94]One more of the little ones right here.
[246:14.38]35 vitality, 40 endurance, 40 strength.
[246:16.20]Almost at 40, 40, 40.
[246:17.25]At what point then we probably just start putting points into strength.
[246:22.03]I would assume.
[246:23.37]Alright.
[246:24.19]Let's go.
[246:27.27]Let's go fight this boss.
[246:28.77]Because we've got the shortcut to keep going here.
[246:39.96]He's gonna jump.
[246:41.34]And he's gonna die.
[246:42.26]Right in front of me.
[246:42.87]Watch this.
[246:45.93]Oh, don't, you idiot.
[246:54.65]Alright, front door into the new area.
[246:56.87]Or at least the second half of this area.
[247:01.72]Okay, well... Sure.
[247:04.88]Sure thing.
[247:09.40]Let's get some line of sight here.
[247:18.88]Hello?
[247:21.50]Ah!
[247:22.34]Okay.
[247:23.89]So!
[247:29.77]Who's that?
[247:36.53]Uh... Is this an enemy?
[247:38.75]Is this the boss?
[247:44.36]It's not.
[247:44.92]It's just a big guy.
[247:48.84]I thought we were going to get a boss meter or something.
[247:51.68]Alright, well... I can't even tell what part of this guy's body is attacking me, but that's fine.
[248:11.56]Chain helm.
[248:14.28]Anything else in this room?
[248:19.50]Nothing there.
[248:22.28]I don't think so.
[248:37.01]Calling a elevator.
[248:38.29]Is this going to be the elevator?
[248:40.63]What?
[248:42.09]Did I put him there?
[248:42.87]I feel like I put that guy there.
[248:46.89]No, did I?
[248:47.37]I didn't.
[248:48.27]He's just there.
[248:53.14]Another bonfire?
[248:55.18]Wait, hold on.
[248:58.87]Can I go in any of these?
[249:04.39]Doesn't look like it.
[249:11.27]Bonfire lit.
[249:18.51]Well, I'm not gonna kindle this yet.
[249:22.23]Because I still have 13.
[249:22.87]I'm just going to sit at it.
[249:33.18]Not another dark area.
[249:34.34]Don't give me another dark zone here.
[249:41.03]Just in case.
[249:41.61]I feel like it's going to be one.
[249:43.85]Where's the lantern?
[249:52.68]Is it?
[249:53.26]It is.
[249:53.72]Fuck you.
[249:54.42]No shit.
[249:55.30]It is.
[249:57.28]Shit.
[249:58.35]What is that?
[249:59.07]It's one of these places.
[250:03.39]You missed really.
[250:22.55]Something tells me I'm not ready for this one.
[250:25.48]I'm gonna have a blast down here.
[250:31.36]You actually dodged it.
[250:36.08]Oh my god, my back is killing me!
[250:38.14]I just wanna like jump backwards and land directly on my back.
[250:44.14]And have it be like Then maybe it'll like fix itself after a month.
[250:52.80]Dark bead.
[250:53.46]It's a spell.
[250:58.02]I just want a huge person to pick me up and do like a Bugs Bunny where they turn me into a ball and stretch me out and stuff.
[251:04.82]Remember the guy with the big mustache in the Looney Tunes cartoons?
[251:07.48]They rode on a bike.
[251:13.46]Well, here we go.
[251:18.97]Can't wait.
[251:19.83]This is gonna be fun.
[251:21.35]Another dark zone.
[251:29.50]Yeah, it was two guys.
[251:34.56]Nothing over here.
[251:36.82]I'm not sure this is even helping, but I'm not going to take it off.
[251:46.26]Hello?
[251:52.10]Did those things do anything?
[251:53.14]Are they just part of the environment?
[252:01.94]Wait a minute, don't I have this thing?
[252:05.38]Oh, yep, I do.
[252:08.72]I can send them back to hell.
[252:19.06]Easy.
[252:21.94]Back to hell.
[252:25.38]That scares them.
[252:35.77]Are they coming over here?
[252:37.03]I don't know if they're coming.
[252:37.91]Are they a decoration?
[252:38.97]These guys are just a decoration.
[252:42.68]Oh, no, they're not.
[252:44.66]That doesn't do anything.
[252:49.28]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[252:50.98]What am I supposed to do?
[252:52.35]What do I do about these?
[252:53.13]Can I kill them?
[252:57.99]Okay, they can die.
[253:01.35]Oh, fuck.
[253:05.46]They don't shoot any projectiles.
[253:14.41]Look at these souls they give.
[253:15.21]They don't give anything.
[253:19.55]Somebody said use the lantern.
[253:20.45]That doesn't do shit.
[253:26.55]Lantern doesn't do anything.
[253:33.21]Okay, I just gotta go.
[253:35.41]This way, apparently.
[253:38.79]Oh, dear.
[253:40.54]Oh, dear me.
[253:41.60]Fuck you, Mr. Blobby.
[253:43.82]You suck.
[253:56.33]Am I going the right way?
[253:57.19]Let's just go here.
[253:59.28]Oh.
[254:00.14]And he's still shooting me with his fucking stupid spell.
[254:04.24]He's gonna hit me again.
[254:04.88]Alright.
[254:14.96]Give me a second.
[254:18.64]Twin humanities.
[254:19.56]That's good.
[254:20.18]Gonna need them later.
[254:26.92]There's something down there, but hold on.
[254:28.70]Is there another way I can go, or... Did you hear my voice right there?
[254:32.30]Is there another way I can go, or... Like, I am scared to be here.
[254:50.37]White Titanite slab...
[254:57.87]Why do I ignore every helpful thing in chat, but I listen to the one fucking lantern guy?
[255:03.01]I don't know because I glanced over and saw it.
[255:12.76]There has to be something else I can do here.
[255:19.52]So the guy telling me to use the lantern was just fucking horseshit.
[255:26.09]It was just a bunch of nonsense, is what you're telling me.
[255:29.51]It's all of a hero.
[255:42.09]The lantern is 100% useless.
[255:43.87]Okay.
[255:45.33]So here is the boss door.
[255:51.03]I was messing with you.
[256:02.94]I have the pendant equipped, and I tried it.
[256:04.60]It didn't do anything.
[256:13.76]No, I'm Lantern Guy.
[256:15.90]This is a secret wall here.
[256:23.67]Look at the pendant's description.
[256:24.83]Didn't we already do this?
[256:25.57]It was like, you can fend off all kinds of evil.
[256:28.61]Oh, fuck.
[256:33.68]yeah effectively deflects the dark of the abyss especially in a magic form why aren't I used it it didn't do anything though I'm that pendant okay well somebody said there was a wall or something back here
[257:04.30]Illusion.
[257:08.41]Over here or something?
[257:09.13]Where?
[257:15.25]Wait, did one guy tell me there was a fucking illusion wall back here?
[257:24.38]This is actually very easy to get to, though.
[257:25.80]So, let's just go.
[257:26.92]Let's see what he does.
[257:30.38]Whatever.
[257:30.70]I got 12.
[257:31.24]It doesn't matter.
[257:31.96]Let's fight this guy and see what happens.
[257:42.72]I'm going to fight a boss in a dark area.
[257:56.17]Okay.
[258:07.72]Who is it?
[258:15.10]This guy looks, uh... This guy looks very unfriendly.
[258:20.74]Should I join Manus, the Father of the Abyss?
[258:25.59]Sure.
[258:25.83]Alright, he's got a huge sloppy hand.
[258:28.03]And then he has a regular hand.
[258:31.47]Big sloppy hand is slow.
[258:33.29]The regular swing hand is not slow.
[258:36.03]Okay.
[258:38.18]Okay.
[258:43.18]I feel like this is a moveset fight where you need to learn his moveset.
[258:46.50]Otherwise, you're just gonna die.
[258:52.62]Where the fuck did he go?
[258:53.60]Okay.
[259:05.17]Oh, that was a spin?
[259:11.97]Looks like he only attacks with that other hand.
[259:15.45]For the most part, at least.
[259:16.29]Hmm, not quite.
[259:29.66]Again?
[259:32.99]Shit.
[259:34.45]Ah, I didn't want to drink that twice!
[259:35.65]Fuck.
[259:42.07]Well, okay.
[259:43.37]Good thing I only got... Sure.
[259:47.09]I'll take it.
[259:53.61]Whoa, that's new.
[259:54.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[259:55.56]Pendant!
[259:58.52]Okay, that's what you gotta do.
[259:59.36]You gotta use a pendant.
[260:03.42]Oh, I'm dead here.
[260:18.73]So it doesn't actually delete them.
[260:22.03]It just makes them freeze.
[260:24.61]OK.
[260:26.71]Oh, damn it.
[260:27.21]I got to Kindle this to 15.
[260:37.66]Alright.
[260:38.80]So let me get three humanities here.
[260:48.08]I think I'm going to try Goldfine as well.
[260:50.08]I'm going to try just to burn him.
[260:51.42]This is a burn fight.
[260:52.24]It just is.
[261:02.94]Wait, twisted behind you?
[261:04.26]What do you mean?
[261:06.60]Get a shortcut to the other fire.
[261:10.20]Oh, shit.
[261:11.94]We're back here.
[261:23.84]Look behind you.
[261:30.51]One guy.
[261:32.03]You know what?
[261:33.11]That's not a far run.
[261:34.33]I'm just... We're just going for it.
[261:36.85]I'm not gonna even re-chat anymore.
[261:39.37]I'm just gonna go beat Manus.
[261:44.60]I'm just running right to him.
[261:45.58]I know where to go.
[261:46.12]I'm gonna get this to 15.
[262:05.50]Hey, one guy.
[262:06.52]Tell him to use the Calamity Ring.
[262:12.46]Use the lantern against him for critical damage.
[262:14.48]No, I don't think so.
[262:17.40]I don't think that's what I'm doing.
[262:24.49]Alright.
[262:25.33]I'm just going to try to run there.
[262:26.73]Forget all these other things.
[262:28.21]Let's take a look, though.
[262:29.41]I've got the gears alright.
[262:30.97]Everything's fine.
[262:33.09]I do want to put on a gold pine.
[262:37.15]I feel like I just want to try it.
[262:38.61]Might as well.
[262:39.19]I haven't used it at all the whole game.
[262:40.61]So we're going to try to just burn him with gold pine.
[262:44.94]And I got the silver pendant when he does that move.
[262:46.60]And then I have to dodge very quickly.
[262:48.08]Alright.
[262:48.54]I'm ready.
[262:49.14]I'm tying.
[262:49.68]Let's go.
[262:52.64]That was the wrong way.
[262:53.56]I thought it was right straight there.
[262:55.36]Okay.
[262:56.16]No.
[262:56.70]Get your hats on.
[262:57.56]Let's get moving.
[263:02.89]Okay.
[263:04.37]Nothing happened there.
[263:05.01]Nothing bad happened.
[263:07.43]It's this way, actually.
[263:08.51]I saw the blue and I thought it was... Oh, go the blue way.
[263:17.15]Forget all this.
[263:17.79]Just run right to that and you slide down.
[263:20.84]Just watch out for the fucking guy shooting the spells and you'll be fine.
[263:26.76]Right?
[263:27.08]Yes.
[263:27.46]I don't know.
[263:29.50]Okay, here we go.
[263:46.60]Probably a better way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet.
[263:52.23]Fuck you, guy.
[263:55.51]Fourteen.
[264:01.49]Okay.
[264:02.92]I'm gonna do it.
[264:04.10]Let's do it.
[264:12.28]Let's get the gold pine on, step through, and go for it!
[264:21.36]And then charge him and just go for straight up death.
[264:23.58]Ah, it's a fucking cutscene every time.
[264:25.49]And where... Hmm, it's not much more.
[264:55.87]Shit.
[264:59.39]Easy now.
[265:09.09]Wow!
[265:09.99]Fuck.
[265:14.56]Jesus Christ, you gotta get behind him when he does this.
[265:23.07]Jesus fucking Christ.
[265:25.63]There's nowhere I could go.
[265:26.51]I just... Maybe underneath him?
[265:37.88]Oh, this is rough.
[265:38.56]Okay.
[265:39.14]I'm not putting on the Calamity Ring.
[265:52.21]Have you tried killing him in one hit yet?
[265:53.97]I try, I don't know what it is.
[265:55.18]I just don't, I can't do it.
[266:02.36]The one thing that I have a problem, trying to time, can I just jump down here?
[266:07.16]I can, okay.
[266:10.58]Please don't follow me down here.
[266:12.84]Is this the correct way?
[266:13.71]Get the fuck away from me.
[266:17.21]No, this is the wrong way.
[266:18.51]I gotta help me.
[266:21.52]Where the fuck am I?
[266:22.52]I'm just picking up items and shit.
[266:26.34]Black flame.
[266:27.58]Where am I?
[266:34.07]Okay.
[266:35.95]Okay.
[266:36.73]Um.
[266:41.81]I don't even know.
[266:42.31]I don't know where I am.
[266:45.92]That's not the right way either.
[266:46.84]Oh, I'm somewhere right to the middle.
[266:50.26]That's how you play football, guys.
[266:51.20]That's an HP sneak.
[266:54.16]Take notes.
[266:57.12]I... I don't care.
[267:00.46]I don't care.
[267:13.19]We're just going.
[267:14.15]I was going to walk around in circles there for like two minutes.
[267:16.05]No.
[267:16.61]I already used flask.
[267:17.96]No.
[267:18.78]No.
[267:20.60]No, not happening.
[267:22.12]What is going?
[267:31.58]Okay.
[267:35.68]Part of me wants to switch to the Dragon Axe.
[267:41.37]But that's probably a terrible idea.
[267:44.91]Considering... Considering how... I wonder if I can dodge this.
[267:53.44]Yeah, he said to dodge.
[267:56.37]He's so fast, I don't think that's a good idea.
[268:03.91]Use the Calamity Ring.
[268:04.87]Fight me.
[268:05.31]Sincerely, Lantern Guy.
[268:09.46]Whatever.
[268:13.84]I actually should take this off the bar.
[268:17.37]Because it's not doing much.
[268:18.53]And I really want to be able to switch between these two.
[268:20.41]I will have a meltdown.
[268:25.93]Okay, here we go.
[268:30.08]Ah, that little delay there.
[268:31.18]Fuck.
[268:34.28]Again, he did it again.
[268:35.10]Fuck!
[268:49.23]What if I should stay on the left side here?
[268:52.83]Oh god, not this again.
[269:05.88]He does like this.
[269:07.02]He like throws his hands in the air.
[269:10.32]Like that.
[269:10.62]That's it.
[269:10.90]That's it.
[269:12.61]How the fuck do you avoid that?
[269:14.47]What do you do?
[269:16.03]How do you get away from that?
[269:25.79]Jesus Christ.
[269:28.75]Get away from me for a second here.
[269:46.64]Aye.
[269:51.27]Here we go.
[269:51.61]Did that not do anything?
[269:55.47]What the fuck?
[269:56.27]I don't... Once... Damn it!
[270:02.74]There it is!
[270:03.52]Ah!
[270:06.46]Ah!
[270:09.52]No!
[270:10.16]No, no, no!
[270:15.11]Oh, I'm fucking dead.
[270:16.45]Oh my god, this guy is horrible.
[270:23.52]Ugh.
[270:25.74]Should I even be using that?
[270:26.80]I feel like that pendant sucks.
[270:28.16]Like, I feel like it's a waste of time.
[270:33.23]Like, I feel like going like this and going, ugh, it doesn't even, it doesn't help at all.
[270:36.43]Might as well just dodge the damn thing.
[270:45.34]Well, this is by far... I think this is the hardest boss so far.
[270:49.88]That I've seen.
[270:50.80]In this particular video game.
[270:52.40]For sure.
[270:53.70]Taking unnecessary... I'm gonna get this to 20, by the way.
[271:02.03]If I don't do it in the next two or three attempts, we're going human.
[271:04.81]And I'm doing 20.
[271:07.72]Fuck it.
[271:09.42]Spam the... Spam the pendant.
[271:12.36]That leaves me so open.
[271:15.24]Oh my god, fuck you.
[271:16.76]Why does that guy have to be there?
[271:19.29]Like, how unnecessary of a fucking enemy do you have to get?
[271:24.99]That guy is that... Like, I'm gonna get hurt if I do that.
[271:35.20]I mean, I'm getting him reliably to like 50%.
[271:36.96]It's just that... I think every time he throws his hands in the air like that, I'm just gonna run away.
[271:49.98]Right?
[272:02.06]Let me just take a look here.
[272:02.98]I wonder if that'll work.
[272:07.88]I... No, I have no idea.
[272:11.82]I have absolutely no idea how to get away from that.
[272:14.36]It's so quick.
[272:21.51]Just run the other direction?
[272:43.43]Don't do it.
[272:43.89]Don't do it.
[272:44.35]It doesn't do that much damage, but it puts you in a really bad spot.
[272:52.37]You land on the ground, it's just not good.
[273:03.90]Part of me wants to hit him and then run.
[273:05.16]Let me just focus on him for a second here.
[273:17.71]Now just turn around and run.
[273:23.53]Yeah, that's it.
[273:24.98]You just really want to hit him and then get away.
[273:26.50]Alright, now get me the fuck away from him!
[273:56.47]How did that not hit him?
[273:57.15]I don't understand.
[274:14.15]Fuck.
[274:15.15]No!
[274:27.58]I'm so scared of this guy Come on do it
[275:00.90]Come on, Manus.
[275:02.54]Give it to me.
[275:04.14]Woo!
[275:23.97]Don't blow it.
[275:26.47]There he goes, there he goes, there he goes, there he goes.
[275:27.81]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[275:28.55]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[275:30.83]Full health.
[275:31.52]I want full health.
[275:33.34]Nothing more.
[275:44.89]Oh, you dick!
[276:03.09]Oh my god, he's still alive.
[276:09.73]Do it!
[276:11.87]Don't die from this!
[276:12.59]No!
[276:24.91]My whole life just flashed before my eyes.
[276:34.03]I thought I was going to get hit by every one of those things.
[276:38.55]Alright.
[276:39.47]He was fucking hard.
[276:46.84]That was tough.
[276:48.52]That was a cool fight, though.
[276:51.01]Okay, let me pick these up first.
[276:52.87]Before I talk to the dead person on the ground.
[276:56.27]Okay, I'm going to mod Manus now.
[276:57.93]Manus is getting modded.
[276:59.05]That was a good fight.
[277:02.45]Okay, should I do this first?
[277:07.37]I feel like I'm scared.
[277:08.19]I'm gonna light the bonfire first.
[277:09.37]36.
[277:19.05]Let's see what you have to say.
[277:27.35]Hello.
[277:34.16]Is that it?
[277:37.18]It's time for phase two.
[277:41.74]Should I just stick my boot up in the air and just slam it down on her head?
[277:54.78]Pendant.
[277:57.43]Ah, this is gonna kill her.
[277:58.13]I'm not doing it.
[278:01.83]No!
[278:02.93]I thought I had the lantern.
[278:12.85]Don't make me do this.
[278:13.67]I'm going to go talk to the mushroom lady.
[278:38.13]So we need to go to...
[278:42.78]Uh... Sanctuary Township, right?
[278:56.32]Wrong.
[278:57.03]Wrong again.
[278:59.39]Wrong again.
[279:03.53]How do I get them wrong?
[279:04.71]Because they're all the same.
[279:05.91]Sanctuary Garden, Sanctuary Town, Sanctuary Hipbone, Sanctuary Skull.
[279:21.74]What is he doing here?
[279:27.62]What's going on?
[279:28.66]Why are there two of these people here?
[279:32.30]What the fuck is this?
[279:33.87]Um... Right.
[279:49.29]Okay.
[279:49.79]Well, I'm going to level up again.
[279:51.55]You're going to be shitting me.
[279:56.09]Okay.
[279:59.29]Let me just level up again.
[280:00.75]I just beat Manus.
[280:05.00]Don't be a chump.
[280:05.88]There's two of them.
[280:06.82]I didn't beat two Manuses.
[280:23.61]That should be enough.
[280:29.17]Vitality.
[280:29.71]There it is.
[280:30.13]Okay.
[280:32.82]Let me talk to the lady first.
[280:39.00]Where are we?
[280:39.42]Sanctuary.
[280:40.10]Where's the garden?
[280:43.53]I am the garden.
[280:44.51]So I have to go this way.
[280:52.23]Did I miss stuff?
[280:52.91]Well, I'm gonna miss a lot of things.
[281:05.18]Talk to the manticore babies?
[281:06.46]I'm not doing that yet.
[281:09.12]I'm talking to the lady.
[281:14.16]I have awaited thee.
[281:16.04]Thou hast rescued Princess Dusk and rid us of that terrible primeval human, even halting the spread of the abyss.
[281:24.80]I salute the grandeur of our enterprise.
[281:27.98]Please allow me to express my gratitude.
[281:31.50]I thank thee, as do we all.
[281:35.78]Elizabeth's mushroom.
[281:39.65]Okay, what the hell is that for?
[281:42.09]I will remember this.
[281:43.63]No one will sing thy praises, for it will be my purpose to remember.
[281:50.15]May the flame... Okay, let me see what those do.
[282:00.52]Great, it restores HP for a limited duration.
[282:04.66]uh large medicinal mushroom of Elizabeth keeper of the sanctuary eating this mushroom invigorates the flesh and greatly restores HP for a limited amount of time its dramatic effect can make the difference between a warrior's life and death okay so that's one of those panic buttons
[282:29.55]Alright, let's go fight the double manticores and lose over and over again.
[282:31.95]That sounds like fun.
[282:33.75]No, do not warp there.
[282:39.21]Kill her.
[282:40.21]No.
[282:46.11]Can fix somebody's back.
[282:47.57]I need that.
[282:53.44]Can you get me to say the word poop?
[282:57.32]Okay.
[282:59.41]I don't know why.
[283:02.75]Alright, let's see what happens when I stand out here.
[283:16.24]Okay, well, let's isolate them.
[283:24.52]Oh my god.
[283:29.92]Is there a point of this?
[283:38.57]What?
[283:38.91]I didn't rest at it.
[283:39.67]Goddamn.
[283:45.65]You don't have to do this.
[283:49.35]I'm gonna give this a few tries.
[283:55.56]Shoot them from inside the cave?
[284:05.79]Did they take the same amount of damage as the boss did?
[284:09.00]I'm curious.
[284:10.62]Let me get like a hit on them.
[284:21.54]Oh my god.
[284:29.39]They're making like storms and shit.
[284:39.09]Okay, alright.
[284:39.63]We're alright.
[284:40.25]We're alright.
[284:41.72]Coming up.
[284:43.56]Oh, fuck you!
[285:00.19]Which one had the low health?
[285:08.16]Oh, fuck off, man.
[285:09.16]Really?
[285:15.17]Ah!
[285:18.79]Swing the fucking sword!
[285:20.14]What are you doing?
[285:22.00]Why would I... I was pressing L1 like a thousand times.
[285:36.01]Oh, you dick.
[285:39.37]He's dead.
[285:42.13]Okay, one dead.
[285:44.91]What do we got?
[286:01.46]Ayayay!
[286:18.95]Oh, you fucking little dick.
[286:28.12]Dick!
[286:29.74]You're a dick!
[286:38.41]I can't see anything!
[286:46.93]You're a dick!
[287:10.29]Alright, I beat the secret boss.
[287:20.14]You don't get anything.
[287:21.10]Okay.
[287:21.92]Well, you just get to say I did it.
[287:32.03]Now reload and fight four at a time.
[287:39.10]Okay, so this... I'm done with this area.
[287:42.68]Did I actually... Is the DLC over?
[287:46.53]That's it, right?
[287:52.01]There it is.
[287:52.43]Okay.
[287:55.86]Go back and talk to the princess.
[288:07.90]Have you enjoyed the best part of the game?
[288:11.10]No, that was great.
[288:13.60]Those were really challenging, fun encounters.
[288:17.31]The areas were kind of crazy.
[288:21.65]That was really cool.
[288:23.65]So now am I about to be sorely disappointed for the next three or four hours of this game?
[288:36.35]Alright, where, where to now?
[288:40.13]Alright, let me, can I do anything else with this?
[288:53.01]This actually is probably a good stopping point.
[288:59.59]Five hours or so.
[289:00.47]I think this is a decent stopping point.
[289:04.29]Because that's the DLC.
[289:06.53]And then we'll finish the rest of the game for the final stream of Dark Souls Remastered.
[289:13.04]And it's getting to be about like midnight.
[289:16.56]Five hours or so.
[289:20.76]We will pick up right when we left off.
[289:25.59]Duke's Archives is pretty decent.
[289:26.87]That's the next place we're going.
[289:29.69]Yeah, so that's going to be it for tonight.
[289:33.49]Actually, it was a lot of fun.
[289:35.97]A lot of cool things that I've seen in Dark Souls Remastered.
[289:38.41]That was pretty cool.
[289:41.59]So how many bosses are left?
[289:45.71]Actually, a better question should be how much time is left in the game?
[289:53.88]Hours-wise.
[289:55.46]After completing the DLC and being at Duke's Archives.
[289:59.50]At least two or three.
[290:03.06]okay somewhere around four or five five alright so here's the deal the next stream which is going to be on Friday we are going to start early and we're just going to play until it's completed
[290:23.80]so any side stuff any might even jump in some pvp uh Friday stream is going to be complete Dark Souls and do the whole thing and don't stop until it's done we'll stick around in pvp I'll turn the online on that is Friday yes the next stream is Friday

[292:23.38]Okay.
[292:25.56]Oh, shit.

[292:37.68]Everybody, thank you.
[292:39.76]What am I doing for the fourth?

[292:44.01]Just going to my mother's house.
[292:48.51]I actually, I don't know how to, I don't think I can restart this.
[292:52.59]No, I can't.
[292:54.57]There's no restarting this credits.
[292:59.76]That just has to run.
[293:01.04]And then we have to do it again.
[293:02.68]So, hey, what do you know?
[293:03.62]What do you do?
[293:04.70]Let's do this instead.
[293:06.18]We're gonna do... We're gonna do the bits first today.
[293:11.36]We're gonna do the bits first.
[293:14.34]Because that's gonna go on for like another few minutes.
[293:20.08]So, starting back here.
[293:22.30]Morgo, thank you for... Let's turn this off.
[293:24.29]We're going to go backwards today.
[293:27.35]Bits first.
[293:31.29]Thank you, Morgo, for the $1.
[293:33.45]Happy almost 4th of July.

[293:49.83]You better watch it now.
[293:52.17]Thank you, MetalSand, for the $1.50.
[293:53.75]Can your next game be that mod of Doom that replaces all the textures and sound assets with Tim Allen?
[294:01.63]Oh.
[294:04.05]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[294:08.09]I don't... We might do, like, a Doom old FPS day or something.
[294:15.35]I don't know if I'll do that, though.
[294:17.79]but thank you.
[294:18.83]Thank you StixRenegade for the $1.45.
[294:20.47]This one second stream delay better be permanent.
[294:25.33]I don't know why I would turn it off now.
[294:28.58]If it works, then why take it off?
[294:32.56]Unless I had a reason to keep it on.
[294:35.70]Thank you again to Kali Brady for the $5.
[294:39.44]That's a lot more than that.
[294:40.36]Thank you to $50.

[294:55.84]Thanks for all the laughs.
[294:59.58]Thank you, Honeychain.

[295:06.32]Thank you.
[295:08.58]Thank you to Radio Vidya for the $1.

[295:53.89]Let's see.
[295:54.37]Okay.
[295:54.71]Ready?
[295:59.55]There you are.
[296:00.17]Alright.
[296:03.34]Please don't share passwords or personal information.
[296:07.16]I promise I won't.
[296:10.06]There we go.
[296:10.44]Okay.
[296:10.84]That's the right person, right?
[296:11.62]Yes, it is.
[296:15.34]Thanks, though, man.
[296:17.32]Thank you to, again, to 3TSLuke for the 50 bucks.
[296:23.60]Tons of money.
[296:24.10]Thank you, dude.
[296:24.60]That's a lot of fucking money.
[296:27.11]You said it's not a lot, but yes, it is.
[296:31.31]It's a lot.
[296:35.23]Thank you.
[296:35.69]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.
[296:37.11]We're all dying to know, how do I cook my hot dogs?
[296:41.43]Boiled, which is gross.
[296:42.81]Grilled, which is inferior.
[296:44.25]Or fried until the outside is black and crispy and the inside is hot and juicy, which is clearly the best.
[296:49.97]Uh, no.
[296:51.95]No.
[296:52.83]I actually do think boiled hot dogs are the best.
[296:57.09]They're the most tender.
[296:58.99]When you bite into a boiled hot dog, you go right through.
[297:02.94]It is by far my favorite.
[297:06.94]Boiled is dumb.
[297:07.80]No, it's not.
[297:08.44]It's the most tender dog.
[297:13.73]If you want like a- you want to bite in and get that snap where you bite the skin and the fucking skin comes off in your mouth.
[297:21.63]That's- that doesn't happen when you boil it.
[297:30.14]You gag at boiled hot dogs?
[297:31.92]What are you talking about?
[297:38.09]That's how I do it though.
[297:38.85]That's my favorite kind.
[297:39.77]KXE thanks for the $30 KXE earlier.
[297:43.56]Thank you so much, man.
[297:44.90]Hydra to Golden Golem to Broken Pendant to Dusk.
[297:48.07]Follow these when the time is right and you will profit greatly.
[297:53.83]That was a weird way to get to the DLC, but I'm glad I have you guys here to help me.
[297:58.84]So thank you, KXE, for the $30.
[297:59.90]Lots of money.
[298:04.13]Garfield, the Monday killer.
[298:06.04]Thanks for the one dollar here.
[298:07.34]Jerma, how's it going?
[298:08.66]Long time no see.
[298:09.38]You remember me?
[298:09.84]It's your old pal Garfield.
[298:10.92]Hope your move to Vegas isn't stressing you out.
[298:13.80]I mean, it is.
[298:14.22]Because, you know, anytime you move across the country and you have to get rid of a house that you currently are in, there's a lot of, it's a pain in the ass.
[298:23.43]But anyways, yeah.
[298:25.11]After all, you can't spell vegetarian lasagna without Las Vegas.
[298:30.05]I guess you can't.
[298:32.11]Uh, you just rearrange a few letters.
[298:34.56]Visit my restaurant.
[298:35.50]It's up.
[298:36.54]We gotta drive.
[298:37.82]You can't miss it.
[298:38.50]Best wishes to you and your loved ones.
[298:39.98]Garf wink.
[298:40.62]And here's the comic book.
[298:44.36]You do this enough times, you're gonna be able to make your own book.
[298:49.17]Let's see.
[298:50.01]Sleeping.
[298:52.83]He wakes up.
[298:53.47]Another day, another garf a graph.
[298:55.09]Garf bucks spent.
[298:57.22]Chat is clamoring about how much they hate me.
[299:00.10]Tons of LARP jokes, even though LARPing is live roleplay and I'm a cartoon cat.
[299:05.55]My goodness, Garfield, how'd you get in that cat box?
[299:08.39]Beat it, Jan.
[299:08.85]I'm having an existential crisis.
[299:10.21]No one likes our comics.
[299:11.21]I turned 40 and no one seems secure.
[299:13.19]In a world without Garfield, what would change if I would disappear?
[299:15.52]Would anyone care?
[299:16.14]Jesus Christ!
[299:22.16]Well, Garfield, thank you for the $1.
[299:23.50]That's...
[299:26.07]You went real heavy in that last panel.
[299:27.79]I was not, uh... I was not expecting that.
[299:31.94]But thank you.
[299:32.34]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $1.
[299:33.62]Joined the furry covenant, I see.
[299:35.14]Hmm... Yeah, I did.

[300:34.15]They say for you a bunch of times.
[300:37.80]That $1 is for me.
[300:39.14]Thank you.
[300:40.41]Machete Mario, thanks for the $1.
[300:41.47]What the fuck is up with you and cat assholes today?
[300:43.53]I don't know.
[300:44.43]I wanted to shove my hand up them because there was like three of them that you could fight.
[300:48.05]And I've been conditioned to put my hand up the pigs and cats assholes from previous games in this series.
[300:55.79]So I don't know.
[300:56.29]I figured that's what it would be.
[301:01.64]Thank you, Zombieman, for the $10.
[301:03.64]Thanks, Zombieman.
[301:06.79]I think I know who you're talking about.
[301:14.04]I've been watching your channel and streams ever since I got my first PC in 2013.
[301:19.50]And I've loved the sense of humor since then.
[301:21.63]Just want to thank you for the opportunity to play one of my most favorite games of all time with you on stream.
[301:27.79]Even if it was just for 10 minutes.
[301:30.57]Thank you, Zombieman.
[301:32.70]Always a pleasure.
[301:35.34]To include people, it's hard to do.
[301:38.36]But... It's... Equal parts fun, equal parts chaotic, and... When you can do it, you can do it.
[301:45.15]But for the most part, you kind of can't.
[301:47.29]And we saw kind of why.
[301:49.65]Doesn't mean I'm not gonna try, though.
[301:53.05]Thank you so much, dude, for the 10 bucks.
[301:55.49]Man, my voice is going out.
[301:56.49]I don't know why.
[301:57.03]It's probably because of the air.
[302:00.91]It's like hot-ass, like, humid air.
[302:04.45]but thank you guys thank you zombie man for the one dollar again to follow up his ten dollars here also I think I speak for all of us when I say that we appreciate everything you do for us every single week brightens us up after long days of work and school to come home and watch you play these games and hear your jokes and listen to you laugh thank you very much thank you very much that means a lot thank you
[302:35.05]Casey, thanks for the two bucks.
[302:36.19]Hey, Jerma.
[302:37.47]Just wondering if you ever watched the movie The Wrestler.
[302:39.49]It's about a washed-up 80s pro wrestler by Mickey Rourke.
[302:42.81]I know you're a fan of old-school wrestling, so I think you'd like it.
[302:45.35]I've seen it.
[302:46.21]I actually saw that movie in the theaters when it first came out.
[302:49.97]On pretty much day one.
[302:52.77]That's a very interesting movie.
[302:56.57]But thank you, Casey.
[302:59.37]Sir Feline, thanks for the one dollar.
[303:03.11]Still in Anor Londo.
[303:08.52]I'm just going to start every stream in Anor Londo.
[303:11.98]Every single one.
[303:14.16]Thank you, Casey, again for the $1.
[303:15.44]Hey, Jeremy, you should check out JQBXFM.
[303:21.84]It's a web app for Spotify that lets you DJ and chat with people.
[303:25.96]I've heard a lot of new music on there, and it's free if you have Spotify Premium.
[303:31.26]I've never heard of that.
[303:33.02]I don't have Spotify, but that sounds pretty interesting.
[303:39.43]So that's just like Twitch streaming, but you're a DJ.
[303:43.84]So that's like DJ.TV.
[303:53.09]Oh, I'm going to choke.
[303:55.41]He said he's not sponsored.
[303:56.33]He's not sponsored.
[303:57.09]He just likes it.
[303:59.85]Thank you, Casey, though.
[304:00.59]Check it out.
[304:02.65]The Marty...
[304:04.65]I got scammed with that, so... If you bought one, I'm sorry that you got scammed, too.
[304:08.87]Cactus has... like, milk in it, right?
[304:13.27]He cut it open and there's coconut milk in there. $2.50.
[304:36.09]It's okay, Jeremiah.
[304:36.73]I eat a lot of fish and I'm not dead yet.
[304:43.62]I know.
[304:44.48]People are crazy.
[304:45.64]People are crazy telling me not to eat fatty fish.
[304:49.50]And how good that is for your brain.
[304:50.96]Yeah, everyone's talking about hot dogs.
[304:55.50]How many hot dogs have you guys eaten this week?
[304:58.86]Don't eat fish, there's Mercury.
[305:00.16]But please eat ground-up pig intestines and cow eyeballs.
[305:04.56]Because that's so much better.
[305:14.75]Yes, it is.
[305:18.93]Thanks, man.
[305:20.31]Thank you VRJosh for the $5.
[305:21.37]Hey, Jerma, sorry for being the one who brought up Mercury in fish.
[305:25.71]It was just a joke.
[305:26.55]I didn't think you'd get all Jerma's son over it.
[305:29.13]Love your streams, man.
[305:30.05]You're great.
[305:30.53]P.S.
[305:30.81]The real danger with fish is the plastic they absorb into their bloodstream.
[305:34.01]You can't just say, sorry for bringing up the Mercury and then give me another danger about plastic.
[305:43.29]Do I have to refute this?
[305:44.41]Do I have to refute that?
[305:52.69]I'm just fucking around.
[305:54.09]We're all just fucking around.
[305:55.05]Don't worry.
[305:56.30]Thank you, VRJosh, for the five dollars.
[305:58.54]You can't absorb plastic.
[305:59.96]I mean, if it's melted down and you, like, breathe it in, I guess maybe, but why would that happen to a fish?
[306:05.26]Hey, Grillmaster, ex-BBQ, thanks for the one dollar.
[306:12.34]Wow, hatin' on burgers, are you Jerma?
[306:14.00]I hope you like your dementia from all that Mercury in your sushi, you weeb.
[306:18.84]Since I'm like the sissy type that's even- that's seen ten whole animes.
[306:24.74]If you had any real taste, you'd go and watch me again on your pro-grilling needs and come back to the light of the true American way of deep-fried butter and bagel bite sandwiches.
[306:34.90]Get the fuck out of here, grill master.
[306:44.41]Yeah, go microwave your Celeste pizza.
[306:48.17]And fold it in half and eat it.
[306:54.81]Hey, Grillmaster, thanks a lot, man.
[307:00.18]Holeof1zombie, thank you.
[307:02.28]Fight me.
[307:04.20]Thank you, Holeof1zombie, for the $1.
[307:06.84]Can I ban that guy yet?
[307:08.04]No.
[307:09.06]Nope.
[307:11.38]He stays.
[307:14.04]Hey, hold the ones on me.
[307:14.80]Thanks for the $1.
[307:15.58]What's the worst thing you ate from a can?
[307:17.28]I had mac and cheese once.
[307:18.32]Tasted like canned hate.
[307:20.74]Worst thing I've ever had from a can.
[307:26.39]Probably a tomato soup.
[307:28.95]I had a tomato soup one time that was in a can.
[307:30.75]It was Campbell's.
[307:32.51]And I don't know if it was just old or sucked.
[307:35.07]But it had this weird layer of tomato foam that wouldn't dissolve.
[307:41.80]So I dumped it in like...
[307:44.14]And then like the actual liquid came out into a bowl.
[307:47.21]And I added the water, put it in the microwave like it says you're supposed to do.
[307:51.57]Stirred it up and it was the- these tomato snots were just everywhere and that was disgusting.
[307:58.23]I don't know why, I've never had- I've had Campbell's tomato soup before.
[308:02.09]Many times and it wasn't like that.
[308:04.27]So I think I just got a bad batch.
[308:09.67]Why did I still eat it?
[308:10.83]I never said I ate the whole thing!
[308:14.14]I said I saw, I didn't eat it.
[308:17.02]I ate like a portion of it, not all of it.
[308:19.38]I moved around like the weird tomato snot.
[308:26.69]But thank you, dude.
[308:27.33]Thank you, uh, youunkscreen for the $1.10.
[308:30.53]Hey, Jerma, just got my fireman shirt today from the Jackbox stream.
[308:35.02]Thank you for all the quality content recently.
[308:36.66]I haven't been able to donate much, but I just want to know that I appreciate everything you do.
[308:44.04]Absolutely.
[308:44.60]Thank you.
[308:45.96]I'm anticipating mine arriving soon too.
[308:50.98]I bought it and then I closed the window.
[308:53.70]So hopefully it comes.
[308:55.21]It's the right address.
[308:59.17]You bet your ass the second I get that shirt I'm going to do a stream and just turn the webcam on.
[309:02.75]I can't wait.
[309:03.51]That's going to be my favorite new shirt.
[309:08.14]But don't worry about donating, dude.
[309:09.72]Seriously.
[309:12.46]Your viewership is enough.
[309:13.54]For real.
[309:15.44]It does way more than you think.
[309:17.05]So, thank you.
[309:18.89]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $10.
[309:20.51]And they just say, thank you.
[309:22.23]Thank you, Lazy Luke.
[309:24.85]Thank you so much for the $10, too.
[309:28.15]Devakitty, thank you for the $10, Devakitty.
[309:32.11]Hey Jerma, me and my girlfriend absolutely love your streams.
[309:34.15]They helped us through much depression and dysphoria.
[309:38.42]I have to go in to prove I need estrogen in a few days and it's got me in the worst depressive episode I've ever had.
[309:43.40]So I'm happy you're here to relieve the pressure and make me smile.
[309:47.32]Have some bits as a token of our gratitude.
[309:51.28]Well, first of all, thank you so much, Demokitty.
[309:54.94]I'm glad to help in any way.
[309:59.51]in the ways that I can right I've talked about this a couple times but I I wish there was more that I could say wish there was more that I could do but just knowing that somebody's somebody likes this and I'm improving somebody's mood that's a huge deal I think about that a lot but good luck to you I wish you all the best
[310:30.05]Thank you.
[310:33.21]Somebody likes this?
[310:34.45]Well, you know, it's... It's a weird thing.
[310:37.07]Because obviously, like, it's a weird... Double-edged sword that I grab onto.
[310:44.30]Because it's like, I want people to like the things that I do.
[310:47.08]But then it's like, when somebody does like it, it's like, Oh, wow.
[310:50.90]You like this?
[310:52.50]Oh.
[310:52.90]I wanted you to like that, but you do like it?
[310:55.66]Okay.
[310:56.44]Hmm.
[310:56.60]Hmm.
[310:57.95]Should I do that again?
[310:58.49]I'm gonna do, I'm gonna try that again.
[311:00.45]Do you like that?
[311:01.21]You liked it.
[311:01.71]Oh, you did?
[311:02.17]Are you sure?
[311:03.15]I hate this.
[311:08.85]I hate watch this.
[311:11.57]Well, thank you for being here.
[311:18.60]I wonder if anybody, you know, I think about that sometimes and it like drives me fucking crazy.
[311:24.14]does I hope did anybody who somebody hate watching me somebody here hate watching me for real like I just that that hurts that brings me another level I don't want that like how do I make that not possible the guy that hates hate watching me right what can I do to make to change that is it money do you want money a bunch of money because he ain't gonna get it from me
[311:55.04]I've hate subbed for over a year.

[312:08.20]Thank you.
[312:08.54]Oh, thank you.
[312:09.06]Thank you.
[312:10.40]I think about that other side as well, right?
[312:14.90]What if somebody just fucking hates you guts?
[312:18.15]That's like an odd feeling.
[312:20.67]Oh, this guy fucking sucks.
[312:21.73]I hate this guy.
[312:23.58]Oh, shit.
[312:24.04]You do?
[312:25.38]Sorry.
[312:26.42]Sorry, dude.
[312:29.21]That's awkward.
[312:30.07]I don't know how to even respond to that.
[312:37.96]There must be someone.
[312:39.02]I'm sure there is.
[312:39.58]I'm sure there is.
[312:51.17]I love you.
[312:51.77]Please notice me.
[312:52.95]I just... Hey, Griff.
[312:55.05]Thank you.
[313:00.51]Anyways.
[313:01.29]Yeah, I think about stuff like that all the time.
[313:05.88]Moving on.
[313:07.82]Lone Tech.
[313:08.42]Thank you, Lone Tech Wolf for the $2.44.
[313:10.38]You're my favorite streamer.
[313:14.24]Been here for a while.
[313:15.66]Keep up the great work.
[313:16.60]Boston man.
[313:17.34]Soon to be Vegas man.
[313:21.11]But thanks, man.
[313:22.83]Appreciate the $2.44.
[313:26.01]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[313:28.76]They're doing another one of those W things with the O's and the W's and every day R is a W. Thank you very much for the wedding invite with the wolf on it.
[313:35.74]Very pretty.
[313:38.24]Yep.
[313:39.40]By the way, Sir Feline, I'm going to tell you right now.
[313:43.05]I ain't reading this in the other way.
[313:44.85]So if you donate like money and you say, hey, look, you got to do it now.
[313:48.55]Oh, no, no, no.
[313:49.23]Just be aware of that.
[313:52.41]I'm not going to read it the way.
[313:54.03]I'm not reading it properly.
[313:55.27]I'm not going to do that.
[313:56.67]I can't.
[313:59.27]I can't do it.
[314:00.19]I'm not going to read it.
[314:00.83]Not now.
[314:01.24]No.
[314:03.30]Thanks very much.
[314:04.10]That's all you're getting.
[314:04.78]Bye.
[314:06.02]That's all you're getting.
[314:06.66]You're getting two words read.
[314:15.27]I don't blame you.
[314:16.07]Good.
[314:21.16]Oh, it hurts.
[314:23.54]It hurts.
[314:24.06]I will never do that again.
[314:30.23]Thank you, though.
[314:30.69]Thank you, Lorag, again for the $50.
[314:31.87]Tons of money.
[314:34.83]You guys spoiled the fuck out of me.
[314:36.09]Thank you.
[314:37.90]Ancient Sasquatch, thanks for the $1.50.
[314:39.60]Jerma, I checked your specs command, and I'd like to know how you managed to get your computer to run with 17 CPUs.
[314:48.22]What?
[315:01.37]Leave it.
[315:02.01]Leave it.
[315:02.27]I got 17 6850s.
[315:06.23]No, leave it.
[315:07.43]I want people to think I'm powerful.
[315:10.85]It's been there forever.
[315:11.61]Whatever, leave it.
[315:16.71]Thank you, ancient Sasquatch.
[315:17.89]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the one dollar.
[315:19.43]You can parry Knight Artorias.
[315:22.37]Actually believing chat.
[315:24.75]I believe you guys all the time, because I trust you.
[315:29.54]Thank you again, Sir Feline, for the dollar.
[315:31.04]Should have named Artorias Dens instead.
[315:36.36]Thank you.
[315:38.12]Erdemius, thanks for the $1.
[315:41.64]Fun fact.
[315:42.76]Marvelous Chester, yes, that's his name, was probably a Bloodborne test character since he fights in a Bloodborne combat style.
[315:49.95]Range weapons, multi-projectiles, leaping dodges rather than rolls, Victorian-era clothes, and is uniquely rigged unlike other NPCs.
[315:58.41]Also, the team who made the Artorias DLC immediately went on to make Bloodborne.
[316:03.87]So that's a pretty good guess.
[316:07.18]Yeah, it is.
[316:10.38]Well, they... They did a great job with this DLC, so I'm not surprised they made Bloodborne.
[316:14.72]Okay, he's uniquely rigged.
[316:20.77]Just like his stances and his character design.
[316:24.97]Damn, what's going on with my throat?
[316:26.69]Am I getting, like, laryngitis?
[316:27.91]That's not cool.
[316:31.09]Judge Artyom, thanks for the $1.50.
[316:34.07]Long have we waited.
[316:34.91]Artorias jebaited.
[316:39.13]Erdemius again, thanks for the $1.
[316:41.69]Another link between Bloodborne, Dark Souls, and Demon's Souls is Patches, who has mostly the same appearance throughout.
[316:48.56]Thank you, Wiki.
[316:50.80]Is Patches in, um... Patches is in every single game, right?
[316:57.33]In Bloodborne, he's the spider.
[317:02.65]But he's the same guy in every game except for... He's not in Dark Souls 2?
[317:09.87]I wonder if there'll be patches in Sekiro.
[317:12.17]That would be interesting.
[317:15.37]He might be pate in Dark Souls 2.
[317:19.39]Interesting.
[317:21.87]Uh, thank you, ZeroGiblets, for the $1.
[317:24.13]Uh, another fun fact about Marvelous Chester, he's voiced by the same voice actor as Jura, the Gatling Gun Hunter in Old Yharnam.
[317:34.78]Both good chaps.
[317:37.14]jura oh right the guy that's sitting on top of the church and he yells at you and somehow you can hear him talking from what seems to probably be a couple miles away and he's talking with a normal speaking voice interesting stuff thank you again sir feline for the one dollar second timing artorias due to being over leveled and having excessive poise
[318:05.67]I thought I wasn't over-leveled for this.
[318:07.77]I was level like 68 when I went into the DLC.
[318:11.16]Was I over-leveled for the DLC?
[318:16.42]Or is that an excuse for me, for you guys to not let me have that?
[318:22.95]Are these excuses so like Jerma, the guy that sucks at video games, can't have that?
[318:27.11]Is that what it is?
[318:44.79]Over-leveled.
[318:47.07]I mean, but I... You guys have watched me play every single ounce of the game.
[318:51.99]I haven't, like, ventured off to go grind souls.
[319:03.75]You did that today.
[319:04.67]No, I did that for five minutes.
[319:07.64]I didn't go do anything else.
[319:14.71]It took you 20 times to beat him, but you were level 2 and your hand was broken.
[319:27.88]Overlevel is not the problem, it's the poise.
[319:31.41]Well, it was my understanding that the first time you ever play through Dark Souls, you want to play with a high poise character.
[319:42.15]Isn't that the thing?
[319:43.31]Don't you want to do that?
[319:44.24]Your first time blind playing through the game?
[319:54.32]He has infinite stamina.
[320:00.66]Wait, didn't I fight Artorias without that armor on, though?
[320:03.46]Or was that the boss before that?
[320:09.53]I thought I took off most of that armor.
[320:10.99]Was that for Artorias or was that for the person right before Artorias?
[320:22.78]Before that.
[320:23.24]You can cheese with the shield.
[320:26.47]I haven't used the shield like one time.
[320:33.79]I don't think I've blocked a boss's attack with a shield the whole game.
[320:38.01]Oh, that was for the Manticore thing, yeah.
[320:44.91]Well, whatever.
[320:45.39]I should just, like, I should just fight, like, the next boss naked.
[320:56.62]And try to beat him first try.
[320:59.04]And then just, and you know, then see.
[321:00.70]And then be like, I'd like for you to say something now.
[321:08.43]With the Calamity Ring.
[321:10.61]And with a weapon I haven't even upgraded yet.
[321:16.79]What's the thing to bring me down from that?
[321:23.18]We'll do it.
[321:23.54]I'm gonna try.
[321:28.80]That's actually a very viable strategy.
[321:34.32]But, thanks man.
[321:35.14]Thank you Lord Camilla.
[321:37.44]Camillus.
[321:39.82]20 Estus?
[321:40.78]Hold on a minute.
[321:42.48]I've been playing this game with 5 to 10 Estus the whole time.
[321:47.12]Only this stream, today, have I had more than 10 Estus Blasts.
[321:54.06]Only this stream.
[321:55.56]This is the only one.
[322:00.19]Give me a break.
[322:02.57]Snap it.
[322:03.17]Snap that in half.
[322:09.78]That's false?
[322:10.30]That's not false?
[322:18.50]It's only downhill from here.
[322:23.38]He has his PC monitor turned on?
[322:25.84]What are you doing, like a heat sensor?
[322:28.30]I don't have a heat... No, alright, you're talking about my actual monitor, not like a thing if my CPU's heating up too much.
[322:34.61]Alright, I'm gonna move on.
[322:39.51]Thank you, Lord Camellius, for the $10.
[322:44.77]Man, talking about Dark Souls 3 reminds me of the time you couldn't kill Dark Eater Medeir.
[322:48.46]You should go do that.
[322:50.36]I did it off-stream.
[322:51.22]Like, right when the stream ended, I just picked the control up and... I took all my clothes off.
[322:57.44]And I beat him.
[322:58.04]I'm talking about in life, not in the game.
[322:59.54]I had to get naked for it.
[323:00.73]It was hot in here.
[323:03.89]But thank you, dude.
[323:04.35]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the 10 bucks.
[323:05.83]Jerma, my 20th birthday is coming up on the 5th.
[323:08.69]And I just want to thank you for all the entertainment you've given me.
[323:11.51]I've been working with special needs folks this summer, and your stream has helped me wind down after a stressful day.
[323:17.35]I seriously look up to you just because of your positive attitude and the amazing way you tolerate these lovable dickheads in chat.
[323:24.62]I didn't say it.
[323:26.36]I didn't say it.
[323:27.38]Somebody else did.
[323:29.73]Thank you.
[323:30.77]I'd be subscribed if my banned account wasn't already.
[323:34.13]Wait.
[323:38.29]I'm sorry you have a banned account.
[323:45.26]I mean, technically I did say it, but I was speaking through somebody else.
[323:48.84]No, they were speaking through me.
[323:52.66]Thank you so much, Smelly Boy.
[323:54.96]And yes, they're all lovable.
[323:55.91]You're all great.
[323:59.36]Thank you, Lorag, again for the $1.
[324:00.78]Streamer brutally murders Morning Widow on stream for her clothes.
[324:06.57]It did happen.
[324:08.49]Hey, Fractal Swordsman, thanks for the $1.
[324:10.47]I missed a lot while having a garbage time trying to complete the pyro contracts on TF2.
[324:15.56]I'm disappointed you stepped down from being the Dark Souls 1 hero, The B. We'll probably go back to The B.
[324:29.31]We will go back to the V. Next stream.
[324:35.21]Hey, Drewbert, thanks for the $1.
[324:36.64]Jerma's back hurts.
[324:37.42]We need a Cairo practice stream.
[324:40.46]No, I'll be one of those people that has a Cairo practice stream and I, like, get... The guy breaks my neck on camera or something.
[324:51.93]Thank you, SirFelon, again for the $1.
[324:53.61]You can really see why they removed the passive poise system.
[324:57.69]Jerma just tanking hits from Artorias and Kalameet, basically ruining the fights.
[325:10.10]How do I respond to this?
[325:17.71]You know, a bunch of people wanted me to put on the Black Knight Halberd and upgrade that and three hit bosses.
[325:23.15]Should I do that instead?
[325:29.02]You know, from my understanding, should I put on lightning and, like, fucking one-hit bosses with lightning?
[325:34.36]It's something you gotta understand.
[325:35.76]Dark Souls 1 is broken.
[325:38.30]There are, like, four different ways to, like, cheese this game completely.
[325:46.05]Like, this whole game is fucked up.
[325:50.67]Like, really.
[325:52.23]I've been told there's, like, five different ways to, like, one or two-hit kill every boss in this game.
[325:57.89]I'm not doing those things.
[325:59.34]I'm trying to just play, and okay, I might have poise, but like... How are you supposed to play this game, like, legit?
[326:10.90]No armor and a dex weapon or something?
[326:13.18]Like, I don't understand.
[326:27.25]I mean, at the end of the day, if I wasn't doing this, and I was doing something else, I'm sure somebody would say something about that too.
[326:41.82]Just don't even play.
[326:50.82]I'm just saying, from my understanding, that's like... If it wasn't one of these things, it'd be one of the other things.
[327:04.99]But regardless, I'm just gonna play it.
[327:10.37]I told you guys this from the very beginning.
[327:12.40]I've never played it before.
[327:15.56]So I'm just gonna play it.
[327:18.04]Sure, if I want to play through a second time and do something a little bit harder, give myself more of a challenge, I will.
[327:27.26]But thank you, Donut, for the $1.
[327:28.62]Thanks a lot, dude.
[327:33.43]Sir Phelan, thanks again for the $1.
[327:35.29]Dark Souls is so easy.
[327:36.41]Just reduce their health to zero and keep your own above zero.
[327:40.74]Works every time.
[327:44.70]That's usually how it works.
[327:48.62]Although sometimes, though, you get a boss's health to zero and then they do a move that hits you way later.
[327:55.17]So, you know, it almost happened to me 15 minutes ago.
[327:58.67]20 minutes ago.
[328:03.73]Hey, thanks a lot, Milkman, for the $1.
[328:05.07]Please make more good videos like Otto's Adventure and less bad videos like Rat Movie.
[328:09.51]I don't know if you want to say that out loud.
[328:12.12]You just went into the Manchester United football stadium and just yelled as loud as you can.
[328:20.22]This is the worst fucking team in all of England.
[328:23.81]They're terrible.
[328:24.85]They should be demoted to the secondary leagues.
[328:29.35]That's what you just said.
[328:30.91]So I'm just saying, I don't think you want to do that.
[328:41.53]Who said that?
[328:42.35]I'm not even going to say who it was because I want them to get away with it.
[328:53.31]But thank you to Sand Raker for the $1.00.
[328:57.28]Hey, Jerma, do you have any advice for someone who is struggling with depression?
[329:00.64]The last few weeks especially have been really hard.
[329:02.48]I think about suicide almost every day.
[329:05.80]And I'm just so tired.
[329:06.88]This isn't a troll message.
[329:08.00]I really mean this.
[329:08.68]And I want to know if you have any encouraging words.
[329:11.25]Your streams and videos are one of the things that seem to keep a smile on my face lately.
[329:15.31]Love you.
[329:17.63]Well, first of all, I would say if you're thinking that already, you need to start.
[329:23.05]You need to talk to somebody.
[329:25.38]You've got to talk to either a doctor or a family member or a friend or you've got to talk to somebody.
[329:32.22]Because being there already, that's not good, right?
[329:37.93]You never want to get there, right?
[329:40.39]So I would say try to get in touch with somebody.
[329:48.45]As much as I would love to give you a bunch of advice... I think that a... A actual professional is way more equipped to give you that advice.
[329:59.69]But... But... Also keep in mind... I don't know... I don't know how old you are.
[330:08.74]I'm not sure what your age is, but... Depending on how old you are... A lot of people get into this... Into a mode... I was in it before too.
[330:17.38]Where...
[330:19.33]You're talking about like 10, 15 years ago.
[330:23.46]Where I felt like shit every day.
[330:28.62]Every single day.
[330:31.24]And eventually... Eventually you get to a position... Where... A time... This sounds like a meme, it really does.
[330:43.07]But time does like heal all wounds.
[330:47.36]What you think is impossible right now, time and dedication can solve it.
[330:57.02]But please, please, please, I implore you, don't feel bad or feel wrong or stupid or something for talking to a professional.
[331:03.98]They will help you.
[331:13.04]You never want to get there.
[331:14.00]You never want to get to that spot that you're talking about.
[331:20.58]Try to make yourself happy every day.
[331:22.24]Small things.
[331:22.84]Little things.
[331:27.96]And again, I don't know your situation.
[331:29.32]I don't know, again, how old you are and all that stuff.
[331:35.63]But please.
[331:38.67]It ain't worth it.
[331:40.39]It ain't.
[331:43.75]Talk to somebody.
[331:52.24]A lot of us have been there.
[331:53.94]Stick with us.
[331:54.70]Seek out help.
[331:57.38]Yeah, and if anybody, of course, please link the Discord.
[331:59.52]I'm sure there's a lot of... We've talked about it a million times.
[332:02.60]But there are a lot of people in that Discord that are just hanging out and talking.
[332:06.19]And I'm sure a lot of them have been in that same scenario.
[332:08.49]So... But regardless of what any personal person, anybody on the internet, any friends of yours... Again, I'm going to reiterate this one more time.
[332:18.94]don't feel bad talking to a professional or getting a medical help, a medical treatment.
[332:25.83]It's there.
[332:30.17]I wish you the best of luck, Sandraker.
[332:32.15]Please take care of yourself.
[332:37.84]And good luck, because it's a... Depression sucks.
[332:41.12]It's a battle.
[332:46.68]But I'm really rooting for you here.
[332:55.60]Helping yourself is more brave and manly than not getting any help at all.
[332:58.62]That's true.
[333:08.75]And moving on from that, we're going to move on to SirFeline.
[333:13.41]Thanks for the $1.
[333:15.66]Still in Anor Londo.
[333:16.92]What a garbage streamer, Kappa.
[333:18.58]Please read the Kappa thing.
[333:22.58]Feline, alright, Sir Feline.
[333:24.26]You're on like a mass troll mission today, aren't you?
[333:28.82]This is like the fourth bit donation in a row where you've been very mean to me.
[333:40.39]What's with the hostility?
[333:44.85]What did I ever do?
[333:46.85]I put poison in Dark Souls and I beat Artorias.
[333:52.15]That's what I did.
[333:52.93]That's my crime.
[333:57.53]I'm just kidding, dude.
[333:58.15]Thank you, Eves, for the 10 bucks.
[334:01.10]Hey, Jerm, I hope you're doing alright, man.
[334:02.66]Just wanted to ask if you had any tips for fighting the Nameless King in Dark Souls 3.
[334:07.44]Because as of this very moment, I want to kill...
[334:14.43]This is like going off a deep end.
[334:16.74]I wanted to you wanted to kill I'm just gonna read the fact that you said you were gonna kill You're gonna kill the you're gonna you're gonna get the vah the Nameless King And you want to create a black hole to suck you in and tear you apart molecule by molecule He went off on like a fucking paragraph of just a hatred so How did I beat the Nameless King?
[334:42.82]I don't think I beat the Nameless King on my main character.
[334:47.12]I think I beat him on my sorcery character.
[334:56.05]Yeah, I think I was casting, dodging, casting, dodging.
[334:59.71]I don't think I did that.
[335:06.80]I'm trying to remember.
[335:07.96]Because I played him on stream a few times.
[335:11.75]You're an assassin build and you... oh my god.
[335:15.21]I can imagine.
[335:18.48]When I streamed it, I think I was sorcery.
[335:21.14]I don't think I beat him on stream though.
[335:27.44]But I don't... be sorcery.
[335:30.17]And stand back and do heavy soul arrow and then dodge.
[335:34.41]Or you can summon somebody.
[335:36.05]That works too.
[335:44.21]But thanks, man.
[335:45.67]Good luck to you.
[335:46.51]He's a hard fight.
[335:47.77]He's a really cool fight, though.
[335:50.71]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[335:52.03]We get to see Jerma get fucked in PvP on Friday.
[335:55.85]Or maybe I'll surprise you and beat all your asses.
[335:59.67]You know, whatever.
[336:01.33]Hey, Dirty Margaret, thanks for the $1.
[336:03.27]Don't spend this all at one casino.
[336:06.37]I mean, I probably will.
[336:07.15]I'll probably put a dollar into a slot machine and spend it like once.
[336:10.69]Thank you, Carver Toby, for the $1.
[336:12.10]Jerma dies to Ornstein and Smough more times than all bosses in the DLC.
[336:15.48]Must be a god gamer.
[336:19.50]He must be.
[336:21.74]I believe you.
[336:22.50]I agree.
[336:24.70]Hey, Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[336:26.38]Hey, Jerma, I'm late again.
[336:27.32]Sorry.
[336:27.68]Are you going to play Godfather for PlayStation 2 after all?
[336:31.00]It's a great game.
[336:34.02]Once we go back to destroy all humans, this is when we'll probably tap into the last bit of these that I have.
[336:42.02]So I'll probably go back to it.
[336:44.82]We'll see.
[336:46.74]That game was very fun, though.
[336:49.21]Hey, Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[336:50.65]Since you talked about hot dogs earlier, I want to hear your opinion.
[336:53.11]Are hot dogs sandwiches?
[336:54.67]No.
[336:56.59]Hot dog is not a sandwich.
[336:59.23]It is a small sub...
[337:02.63]Which I guess that is a subsidiary of the sandwich.
[337:05.93]So you could say that a hot dog is a subsidiary of the sandwich.
[337:09.37]Because a sub is a sub sandwich.
[337:12.98]I mean, I guess it is, but it's not.
[337:15.50]It's not a sandwich.
[337:16.84]It's like a hoagie.
[337:19.16]A sub is a sandwich.
[337:20.10]Yeah, but it's not.
[337:21.30]A sandwich is a typical two pieces of bread.
[337:26.40]You know, like the loaf of bread.
[337:27.80]Not a sub roll.
[337:32.63]subsidiary sandwich hoagie is a sandwich but it's in like a bun it's not in a sub roll it's not enough it's in a bun would you guys call it is a hamburger a sandwich is a burger a sandwich is that a burger sandwich it is so how come you don't call it a sandwich how can people call it a burger a hamburger why don't they call it a hamburger sandwich
[338:04.85]It has another name.
[338:07.31]So how come people don't say it's a meat sandwich?
[338:15.99]Why do people call pizzas pies?
[338:18.76]I don't know.
[338:19.10]Because they look like a pie.
[338:22.50]People like math class.
[338:29.64]Different kinds of meat?
[338:33.85]We're having this argument at 1230 in the morning, just for curious.
[338:39.28]What does JFC mean?
[338:40.34]Just for curious?
[338:41.90]Just for... What does this mean when somebody does that?
[338:45.84]Just for curious.
[338:48.97]What does it mean?
[338:50.01]Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, okay.
[338:57.30]Thank you though, Clueless Sniper.
[338:58.60]Thank you Casey again for the $1.
[338:59.86]Do a fishing stream.
[339:01.64]I won't catch anything.
[339:03.30]That'll be a very boring stream.
[339:05.42]Hey Graveyard Ghoul, thanks for the $5.
[339:07.22]So you said you never heard of Death Grips, then why do I have this photo of you from that interview?
[339:15.11]That doesn't even look like me.
[339:17.23]I don't look like me.
[339:22.38]Thank you, Half Bondi, for the $2.
[339:23.82]It's like when you eat McDonald's and you enjoy it in the moment, but then you feel bad later.
[339:28.18]That's how I watch.
[339:31.65]McDonald's is fucking good.
[339:33.37]McDonald's is delicious, so you know what?
[339:35.23]I'm happy to be the McDonald's streamer because it's absolutely delicious when you eat it.
[339:40.61]I don't care how badly I give you diarrhea.
[339:45.23]Hey, thanks SirFeline for the $1.
[339:47.65]Anyone have the JermaCraft OWO rating?
[339:49.79]I'd love to share it with the scamming streamer.
[339:54.53]How do I ban this guy?
[340:00.70]Thank you, dude.
[340:01.60]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[340:02.92]Hey, Jerma, can I get a $1 joke?
[340:10.67]Yeah, sure.
[340:30.04]No, sorry, that's the wrong one.
[340:38.76]Okay, here you go.
[340:43.83]Uh, three people check into a hotel room.
[340:46.55]The clerk says the bill is $30.
[340:48.77]So, each guest pays $10.
[340:50.65]Later, the clerk realizes the bill should only be $25.
[340:53.53]To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $5 to return to the guests.
[340:59.25]All the way to the room, the bellhop realizes that he cannot divide the money equally, as the guests didn't know the total of the revised bill, right?
[341:07.14]So the bellhop decides to just give each guest $1 and keep $2 as a tip for himself.
[341:13.24]Each guest got back $1, so now each guest only paid $9, bringing the total paid to $27.
[341:20.99]The bellhop has 2, and 27 plus 2 equals 29.
[341:24.99]So, if the guests originally handed over $30, what happened to that remaining $1?
[341:29.46]Come on.
[341:44.92]He notices bulge.
[341:46.75]That is not the answer.
[341:52.19]Okay, so let's look at the solution here.
[341:54.77]The misdirection in this riddle is at the end of the description, where a bunch of unrelated totals are added together and the listener assumes these numbers should add to 30.
[342:02.70]There is in fact no reason this sum should add to 30.
[342:06.02]The exact sum mentioned in the riddle is computed as this.
[342:09.86]Sum equals $9 payment by guest 1, payment by guest 2, $2 money in the bellhop's pocket.
[342:15.59]The trick here is to realize that this is not the sum of the money that the three people paid originally, as that would need to include all the money the clerk has, $25.
[342:21.51]This is instead a sum of a smaller amount that people could have paid, $9 times three people equals $27.
[342:28.07]Added with the additional money that the clerk would have needed had they paid a smaller amount, $27 minus $25 actual cost equals $2.
[342:33.00]Another way to say this is that the $27 already includes the bellhop's tip to add the $2, $27 would look double-counted.
[342:41.50]So the three guests cost the room, including the bellhop's tip, is $27.
[342:44.64]Each of the three guests has $1 in their pocket, totaling $3.
[342:46.98]And when you add the $27 to the revised cost of the room, including the tip of the bellhop, the total is $30.
[342:54.71]So there you go.
[342:56.25]Thus, the sensible sum that we really desire is the one where there's $1 in everybody's pocket, $2 in the bellhop's pocket, and $25 in the hotel cash register.
[343:11.53]See me after class.
[343:18.15]Alright, how many people did I get to leave the stream?
[343:20.63]What do you think?
[343:21.93]100?
[343:31.51]Hey, you wanted a $1 joke.
[343:32.83]That's the kind of quality shit material you're going to get if you want a $1 joke.
[343:46.91]That's the kind of dog shit material you get.
[343:57.61]That wasn't a joke.
[343:58.89]I know.
[343:59.65]It was pain.
[344:01.09]I gave you pain.
[344:04.13]I will inflict pain.
[344:06.41]Julia.
[344:07.51]Julia, return to the atrium or I will inflict pain.
[344:11.40]What a shitty movie.
[344:16.99]Hey, thank you, Sir Feline, for the one dollar!
[344:20.67]Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[344:21.43]We got more behind us.
[344:26.78]Oh, where are we?
[344:27.66]Where did we leave off?
[344:29.34]Here we are.
[344:31.60]Hey, Cosmic Moses, thanks for the one dollar.
[344:34.14]It's my dog's birthday today.
[344:35.34]She's turning either 16 or 17.
[344:37.76]We don't know for sure because the people at the shelter we got her from don't know either.
[344:41.57]But she's been with us for about 14 years and she's the best.
[344:44.59]Her name is Venus and here is a pic.
[344:48.54]Oh, look at this.
[344:51.84]Holy shit, your dog looks like a Disney character.
[344:59.82]Look at those eyes.
[345:00.68]Oh my goodness.
[345:06.02]17 years young.
[345:08.25]Beautiful dog.
[345:11.45]Happy birthday to Venus.
[345:15.60]Hey, Sir Feline, thanks for... Sir Feline paid $5 in a row here.
[345:20.16]Thank you, Sir Feline, and let's see what they say.
[345:24.34]Uh... Talking about poise, it was the poise, not the levels.
[345:28.72]Beat Gwyn with Calamity Ring, no clothes, and Calamity Ring, and I'll donate lots of bits.
[345:33.17]Sure.
[345:35.87]Sure thing.
[345:36.65]I'll do it.
[345:40.29]I'll beat Gwyn with no clothes and the Calamity Ring on.
[345:42.99]You heard it here.
[345:43.41]It's gonna happen.
[345:47.66]Uh, thank you, Sir Phelan, again.
[345:48.96]Everyone's mad at me for my opinion feels bad, man.
[345:51.62]Um... I don't think anybody's mad at you.
[346:01.21]I think... I think everybody has an opinion.
[346:04.69]I think the point with Dark Souls is... Everybody has, like, an extreme opinion of this game.
[346:11.70]Whether you like to admit it or not.
[346:15.05]So, everyone's opinions are going to smash into each other.
[346:27.72]No, I am mad at him.
[346:29.04]Don't be mad at him.
[346:29.84]He's just saying that Poise is stupid, and that's fine.
[346:34.10]But I'm not going to change my playstyle.
[346:35.81]I've been playing through the whole game for like 40 hours so far.
[346:40.05]Like this.
[346:48.48]Dark Souls sucks.
[346:52.76]This is what I- this is what we were talking about earlier.
[346:54.60]There's like a bunch of- there's a bunch of fucked up shit in this game that should have been patched like seven years ago, whenever this game came out.
[347:01.57]It's in the game, it's here, it's gonna happen.
[347:10.17]I'm telling you, like I said, I'd be getting the same shit if I was throwing lightning bolts.
[347:15.21]Or if I used any of the Black Knight weapons.
[347:21.12]I would.
[347:22.92]It's funny because this is a remaster.
[347:24.70]That is, you know, don't be mad at me.
[347:28.00]Be mad that FromSoftware came up with a remaster and left every single game decision in the game from 2011.
[347:33.33]Is this a me problem?
[347:40.09]Or is this like a we didn't remaster a game that we called a remaster?
[347:43.60]We added a couple of lightbulbs.
[347:50.77]Dark Souls re-released.
[347:52.91]Pretty much.
[347:55.07]I think it's a great game, though.
[347:55.93]I'm having a good time.
[347:57.27]I'm having a great time in Dark Souls.
[348:07.33]Thank you, Spreo, for the three bucks.
[348:09.95]A question, how much do you consider playing Discord-suggested games?
[348:16.95]I mean, I've already done a lot of them.
[348:19.71]I've pulled a lot of streams, at least game-wise, from that Discord, so...
[348:30.34]15% of the stream has been the stream over screen.
[348:31.90]Well, if you're new here, just want to be aware, I do not read subs or bits on stream pretty much ever.
[348:40.26]I don't read donations.
[348:41.80]We do it all at the end.
[348:43.54]So if you think about it, the stream, if I were to stop and say or read a bit or thank a sub, right?
[348:54.37]Over the course of a four or five hour stream, this is how long it would take.
[349:03.06]Oh, somebody said this.
[349:03.78]I'm going to respond to that and talk about that for a minute and then go back to the game.
[349:07.00]Instead of interrupting the game, we just do the stream for four, five, six hours and then do all of this at the end.
[349:15.33]Because I feel like it takes away from the actual stream.
[349:18.59]So we do this every time.
[349:24.95]But we're almost done.
[349:27.51]But that makes you think, though, that like 15 to 20% of every stream is reading something or like talking about bits or subs, right?
[349:36.95]So if it was implanted in the middle of the stream every like 25 seconds, every like two minutes, you see how that extends the middle of the stream.
[349:44.68]Because we're doing it right now.
[349:49.48]Anywho.
[349:50.94]No, I don't want to spite anybody.
[349:52.06]Oh, really?
[349:52.32]This is from Rockstar.
[350:12.98]Just want to say that you got me into TF2 and PC gaming in general, and I wanted to say thank you for all the great experiences you and your content has given me.
[350:19.84]Also, you better play New Vegas on your first stream in your Vegas house.
[350:26.31]No, we don't have to play New Vegas.
[350:28.39]I can walk down Vegas Street.
[350:31.93]My first stream in Vegas could be me, like, walking down the strip.
[350:41.10]We don't have to play it.
[350:41.82]We can do it for real.
[350:45.80]Hey, thank you, Sir Feline, for the one dollar.
[350:48.08]They do a sad face.
[350:49.48]Don't be sad.
[350:50.44]Don't be sad.
[350:52.44]Everybody has different opinions about Dark Souls and Dark Souls games.
[350:55.84]Don't feel sad.
[350:57.18]We all love you, Sir Feline.
[350:58.50]Don't worry.
[351:00.44]And they say, I think, I'm not even going to read it.
[351:03.51]I'm not going to read it.
[351:04.13]Thank you for the dollar, Sir Feline.
[351:07.44]because we're over this whole poise versus not poise we're just gonna keep going and we're gonna thank you so much Mr. feline he said trolling you is so funny this is Kappa you better read this Kappa I did but thank you dude okay let's settle this
[351:36.42]Hey, Varian, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[351:39.31]Hey, Jerma, when I was 14, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.
[351:42.77]I was in a pretty bad spot, and your early videos helped me through a tough time in my life.
[351:46.89]We all go through tough shit.
[351:48.25]It's great to see that six years later, you're still the positive guy that I fell in love with.
[351:51.62]Cheers, dude.
[351:52.10]Thank you, Varian.
[351:54.58]And those fucking sub sounds keep coming to the worst fucking times.
[352:01.24]Anyways.
[352:01.60]Um.
[352:04.64]as somebody that has IBD that knows that life man it uh it can be a real real monumental pain in the ass I've had so many issues with that which I'm sure you have as well the only difference is I was diagnosed with my IBD at like 23 with like 24. so at 14 that's that's I would say even worse so
[352:33.18]I'm happy to try to be positive.
[352:36.06]I'm of the opinion that I'm not even sure if positive is the right idea, you know?
[352:42.44]Am I that positive or do I just try to have fun?
[352:45.42]Right?
[352:47.52]I think life is crazy.
[352:48.96]Life doesn't make any fucking sense.
[352:50.18]So I might as well have fun through the whole damn thing.
[352:55.46]Whatever that means, right?
[352:58.74]I don't know if I like, maybe I do, but I don't know if I give off like
[353:03.35]extreme positivity as much as I... You're here, I'm here.
[353:08.42]We like having fun, we like talking shit, we like having a good time.
