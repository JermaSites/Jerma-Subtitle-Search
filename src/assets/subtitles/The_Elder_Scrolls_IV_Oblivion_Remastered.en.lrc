[00:06.73]Hey, what up?
[00:20.13]There it is.
[00:27.91]Do I have the crunchiest pretzel on Earth?
[00:31.60]That's going to break my teeth.
[00:32.58]I need to be careful.
[00:36.09]I'm probably not going to play that much tonight, but I do want to make the character.
[00:40.04]The crunchy sourdough pretzels, they're amazing.
[00:44.30]It's actually going to be loud.
[00:45.21]It might peak the microphone.
[00:46.37]I'm not kidding.
[00:54.48]Probably sounds like we're chewing glass.
[01:01.37]Alright, are we ready?
[01:03.89]It turned up.
[01:08.11]Press any button to start.
[01:09.11]Well, let's go.
[01:14.20]Already, I messed around with the graphics already.
[01:17.06]I was born 87 years ago.
[01:20.63]Skip, because nobody cares about this.
[01:21.75]For 65 years, I've ruled as Tamriel's emperor.
[01:24.34]I'm kidding.
[01:25.86]But for all these years, I've never been the ruler of my own dreams.
[01:33.00]I have seen the gates of oblivion, beyond which no waking eye may see.
[01:40.06]Behold, in darkness, a doom sweeps the land.
[01:59.88]My compressor is compressing the crunches to make them louder.
[02:06.01]Somebody said it's compressing my laughs too.
[02:27.37]When I get really loud?
[02:28.57]It might, yeah.
[02:31.58]Does it give me some work?
[02:32.95]Yeah, it does.
[02:53.78]This is going to be so annoying.
[02:55.76]I should go to a movie and somebody is just eating hard sourdough pretzels next to you.
[03:02.33]If it's a friend of mine, I'm telling the theater.
[03:04.63]And I'm going to pretend like I didn't do it.
[03:08.48]Excuse me, sir.
[03:09.68]We got a noise complaint.
[03:10.58]And I look over and be like, dude, what?
[03:12.22]Who the fuck?
[03:13.67]Was somebody complained?
[03:16.57]What?
[03:16.97]Dude, okay.
[03:18.05]Well, I don't mean people nowadays.
[03:19.41]I don't know, man.
[03:22.82]I think I'm done.
[03:31.69]Alright.
[03:33.24]What do I want to do?
[03:34.22]Who do I want to play as?
[03:43.41]Let chat vote?
[03:46.43]No, I'm going to pick.
[03:48.69]Maybe a cat?
[03:58.00]I'm desperately trying to get... I am across the room right now.
[04:02.78]And it's still picking up.
[04:09.07]Um... Maybe, uh, Argonian?
[04:29.56]Okay.
[04:35.84]A dark reality.
[04:37.22]You dabbled in magic just to survive, and you're quick with... Yeah.
[04:43.15]Thornmarsh?
[04:46.17]And we're going to do the... We're dabbling in magic.
[04:53.19]Okay.
[05:00.42]Oh, wow.
[05:00.72]You can make it... It can be really crusty.
[05:12.32]I think that looks good.
[05:13.16]Okay.
[05:14.74]Alright, here we go.
[05:19.25]Brow bone.
[05:21.84]Definitely angry.
[05:23.90]Incredibly angry.
[05:29.25]Okay.
[05:33.15]Wait, growths?
[05:35.28]Oh, actually, I should do this first.
[05:37.14]I think I just want to do bald head.
[05:38.86]Yeah.
[05:39.00]Yeah.
[05:42.21]Just bald?
[06:10.42]You can make it pretty wide.
[06:21.88]I want a thin face.
[06:26.25]Yep, good.
[06:39.17]Hold on.
[06:39.89]I'm almost done.
[06:59.98]Okay.
[07:00.70]I'm good.
[07:00.98]I'm good.
[07:01.28]We're good.
[07:03.07]Somebody said keep the turkey neck?
[07:12.09]Okay.
[07:12.21]I like it so far.
[07:13.93]Yep.
[07:14.66]100%.
[07:15.16]Yes.
[07:15.52]Got to have a strong front chin.
[07:24.60]That's a little too wide.
[07:29.21]Looks good so far.
[07:40.35]Far apart or together?
[07:43.83]Together.
[07:48.48]That's good.
[07:49.60]I want the brow, nose, chin to be up.
[07:59.93]I kind of love that.
[08:02.46]It's just weird enough.
[08:03.30]It's weird looking enough for me.
[08:13.41]That's a little too wide.
[08:23.24]Do we have a crushed in head?
[08:27.23]Yep.
[08:30.51]Dude, his side profile is almost flat.
[08:33.26]Like his head is, it's almost like a piece of wood being laid down.
[08:47.31]Underbite or overbite?
[08:49.83]He's really aerodynamic.
[08:53.71]It's exactly why he's going to be a rogue.
[09:03.58]He looks like a shoe?
[09:04.61]He does.
[09:11.09]He looks like a Skechers.
[09:22.91]first mouth definitely happy hmm all the way up all the way up is a little too extreme we want to lengthen this to make him his head more look more like a shoe
[10:03.48]Good, that's more shoe-like.
[10:17.59]I think I like small.
[10:27.16]Okay, nose.
[10:43.93]That looks more like a shoe.
[10:45.69]I like it like this.
[10:58.60]What do you think?
[10:59.04]Like that?
[11:00.14]Or like that?
[11:00.55]Probably like that.
[11:17.31]Those nostrils are freaking me out, but I'm going to keep it.
[11:36.09]That's too deep.
[11:36.65]That's better.
[11:39.88]That's better.
[11:40.28]That's better.
[11:40.64]That's fine.
[11:40.94]Alright, what about eyes?
[11:45.92]Green eyes?
[11:46.62]Blue eyes?
[11:49.74]Those are cool.
[11:52.69]There's a lot of eyes.
[11:57.91]Orange?
[12:00.58]No, no, not orange.
[12:05.82]This is my eye color right here.
[12:10.33]It's like between here and here.
[12:17.52]Make sure you give him lipstick.
[12:24.69]These are perfect.
[12:26.07]Look at how these are kind of weird.
[12:27.25]These are weird looking.
[12:28.06]I like these.
[12:44.10]Yeah.
[12:46.50]Whoa.
[12:50.34]Yep.
[13:11.91]It looks like a crumpled up newspaper.
[13:37.39]I think that I like this.
[13:38.52]Alright, what do we got here?
[13:39.50]We can give him eye shadow.
[13:42.50]Here it kind of has eyeshadow.
[13:45.73]Okay, I'm liking it.
[13:48.71]Go back to the eyes.
[13:57.81]Definitely huge.
[14:05.00]No, alright.
[14:06.36]I like it.
[14:09.02]Fix the nostrils.
[14:12.42]wrong with him now he's perfect okay so now I did that let me see what he would look like with something else
[14:44.82]He kinda looks like a gremlin from Gremlins 2.
[14:51.11]Should I make him a gremlin?
[15:03.23]I don't know, I kinda just want the bald head.
[15:05.20]I think that just fits him.
[15:21.00]I got poison immunity, breathing underwater, good at picking locks, and increased intelligence.
[15:34.52]Name him Shoe Bitch.
[15:40.66]No, we're not going to use your Instagram name, okay?
[15:46.10]Something else.
[15:54.84]This actually looks like you?
[15:56.54]Oh, nice, thanks.
[15:59.98]It could just be, yeah, it could just be the shoe.
[16:05.83]That sucks.
[16:13.23]But I kind of like it.
[16:20.16]Name him Croc?
[16:26.83]how about, what, croc?
[16:35.98]shoe croc?
[16:38.54]croc shoe croc shoe
[17:05.73]I like Krokshu.
[17:09.37]It's just, hey, what character is he and what does he look like?
[17:14.16]It's perfect naming.
[17:18.99]We put like a... That's fine.
[17:24.21]That's fine.
[17:24.67]We're going to look at this name once.
[17:27.30]Krokshua.
[17:29.68]You need to time that person out for imaginary 15 seconds.
[17:36.54]Let's go.
[17:37.52]I'm ready.
[17:42.67]When do I pick my spells?
[17:48.25]Hey, lizard.
[17:49.34]It must break your heart, huh?
[17:52.22]Being so close to the water, knowing you'll never get to swim again.
[17:58.37]You know, sometimes when they let us in the yard, you can hear the sounds from the lake.
[18:05.13]Can't pick this block.
[18:08.19]Yeah, when I get out of here, I'm gonna punch you in the face.
[18:29.91]Stewie Griffin?
[18:34.68]Yeah, open it up.
[18:45.71]You're not gonna kill me.
[19:03.13]Alright, fine.
[19:07.10]I am already away from the door.
[19:11.85]Big mistake.
[19:14.43]Punch the emperor.
[19:18.74]Ha ha ha ha.
[19:21.79]I've seen you.
[19:24.31]Let me see your face.
[19:26.28]You are the one from my dreams.
[19:28.84]Then the stars were right.
[19:31.58]And this is the day.
[19:33.68]Gods give me strength.
[19:37.13]What's going on?
[19:37.77]Assassins attacked my sons, and I am next.
[19:41.15]My blades are leading me out of the city along a secret escape route.
[19:45.18]By chance, the entrance to that escape route leads through your cell.
[19:50.87]Okay, why am I in jail?
[19:57.64]It's been a while since I played this.
[20:10.92]Okay.
[20:11.86]Who are you?
[20:19.01]Okay, hold on.
[20:19.57]Let me change the audio real quick.
[20:25.38]Real quick.
[20:26.80]I should... Do I hear it better now?
[20:31.91]I think I hear it much better now.
[20:34.17]Okay, so do I start punching him in the face now?
[20:50.50]Better not close this one.
[20:51.94]There's no way to open it from the other side.
[20:54.67]This doesn't concern you, President.
[20:56.81]If I start fighting him, am I going to be in trouble?
[20:58.95]What's quicksave?
[21:02.90]It's like F5, right?
[21:10.03]F5?
[21:12.85]Your disk can only lead to your disk.
[21:15.21]This pool now will save us from becoming... Don't give me a reason to kill you.
[21:28.94]Close up left.
[21:30.12]Protect the Emperor.
[21:33.53]What the fuck?
[21:34.13]Why are they fighting each other?
[21:35.03]Why are they killing each other?
[21:38.85]For the Emperor!
[21:42.58]Take that!
[21:43.84]What's going on?
[21:44.54]Are you alright, Sire?
[21:49.48]We're clear for now.
[21:50.60]Yeah, we're good.
[21:51.10]We got rid of them all.
[21:51.88]She's dead.
[21:53.39]Sorry, Sire, but we have to keep moving.
[21:55.89]Keep quiet and stay out of the way.
[21:58.56]Alright, well, I'm good.
[22:02.64]Oh, those are the assassins.
[22:05.77]Right, right, right.
[22:08.53]I remember.
[22:09.59]Give me a weapon.
[22:14.04]Give me something to swing.
[22:15.34]Okay.
[22:15.88]Hey!
[22:30.13]It feels pretty fun to play.
[22:32.74]Rat meat?
[22:33.42]Give it to me.
[22:42.17]Your fatigue is low and you may not be able to perform exhausting actions.
[22:44.65]The green bar at the bottom is your current fatigue.
[22:48.25]Stay on the bar, alright.
[22:53.92]I'll take the rusty iron axe.
[22:59.12]Okay, how do I, uh...
[23:06.57]Where's my inventory?
[23:07.29]I?
[23:11.07]Okay, let's go.
[23:13.75]What difficulty is this on?
[23:14.70]I think it's just on standard, right?
[23:21.89]Oh, check the body to find a weapon.
[23:31.08]Do I want any of this junk?
[23:32.30]I got a cool axe.
[23:40.00]Can I put the robes on?
[23:41.88]I'm going to put the robes on.
[23:46.08]Press QE to change menus for the inventory tab.
[23:47.88]Yep.
[23:54.23]Okay.
[23:57.15]Perfect.
[24:03.42]Tab is journal.
[24:09.09]Or is it journal?
[24:09.69]It's journal.
[24:11.03]Quests.
[24:12.79]Uh-huh.
[24:30.87]Okay.
[24:30.99]So what should I do as a class?
[24:32.45]Should I play... I want to play as a wizard or something.
[24:35.33]I want to do magic.
[24:39.19]Did you do astronaut?
[24:48.89]Flash bolt?
[24:51.97]Give me all of it.
[25:00.00]Flash bolt.
[25:01.22]I want to do it.
[25:04.77]Fire damage on target.
[25:06.69]Chameleon on self.
[25:09.65]Do I have to learn these?
[25:18.96]It's been a long time.
[25:21.57]These are single use.
[25:27.61]Practice casting spells.
[25:28.44]Open your journal, navigate to the magic tab, and equip the clairvoyance spell.
[25:37.13]Ah, here it is.
[25:37.79]Okay.
[25:42.49]Okay.
[25:46.41]C. Oh, nice.
[25:51.34]It's the Fable Tube Breadcrumb.
[25:52.66]Perfect.
[26:06.19]Maybe I want to be a big, huge two-hander.
[26:09.58]I think that's what I want to do.
[26:15.50]Oh, shit.
[26:22.77]I can do two-hander and magic?
[26:27.18]That thing's kicking my ass.
[26:34.44]I'm gonna die to the tutorial zombie.
[26:36.40]Are you fucking kidding me?
[26:53.05]I can eat this, right?
[27:09.02]You're a lizard?
[27:09.66]Yeah, I can eat rat meat.
[27:10.64]That's fine.
[27:20.31]Third person?
[27:21.11]Third person is cool.
[27:29.23]more lockpicks this is a controller game for me cool I prefer first person I think it's more fun
[28:02.30]I made this character I forgot that's what this character was I got kind of jump scared my own face what's my weight 124.
[28:29.44]This is Rat King.
[28:31.34]I can eat the lettuce, right?
[28:37.31]Oops.
[28:45.28]I don't pick up every single item, right?
[28:47.92]I shouldn't be doing that, should I?
[28:55.15]But I can't help it.
[28:58.73]This blade's pretty good.
[29:14.23]Alright, I'm almost there.
[29:20.63]Lighting's beautiful.
[29:26.54]Is there a walk?
[29:28.78]I kind of want to walk.
[29:29.51]I want to take it in.
[29:33.87]Caps lock?
[29:36.72]Yeah, that's more like it.
[29:50.08]Alright, that's what I want.
[29:51.28]Potion of healing.
[29:51.82]Am I drinking these or am I taking them?
[29:53.13]No, okay.
[29:58.97]Is this E3 gameplay?
[30:02.08]Nah.
[30:04.86]Yeah, shortcut.

[30:06.53]It'll tell me.
[30:18.85]Alright, definitely want potion of healing.
[30:20.19]Definitely want rat meat here.
[30:28.76]I definitely want... Um... I think that's good for now.
[30:47.09]Please play a lot of this game.
[30:48.21]I actually do plan on playing a lot of this game.
[30:53.86]Versus 1 through 8 will equip that shortcut immediately.
[30:56.26]Good.
[30:56.64]I'm glad I drank it.
[31:04.21]Alright, this is gonna get hard here.
[31:11.28]It's just freaky to see this like this.
[31:24.08]Did I just kill him?
[31:25.56]I killed him instantly.
[31:28.56]Nice, my favorite roasted rat.
[31:37.79]Alright, quest updated.
[31:40.36]You have a lockpick.
[31:41.08]You can try to pick most locks.
[31:43.32]To move the lockpick from slot to slot, press A, D, press W, or move your mouse up to move the pick upward into a tumbler.
[31:49.91]When the tumbler reaches the top of the lock, you will hear a metallic sound.
[31:54.93]Okay, I gotta remember how to do this.
[32:00.66]When you hear the sound, you press space.
[32:09.55]That was tough.
[32:16.84]Two chevrons will appeal?
[32:18.71]What?
[32:20.43]When a fight begins, two chevrons will show up.
[32:26.70]Alright, I got a water and pestle.
[32:30.77]Alright, rat meat.
[32:35.85]Maybe I should be an alchemist.
[32:43.44]Damage health on self.
[32:45.90]Alright, cool.
[32:48.64]What about two rat meats?
[33:07.01]Love that spell.
[33:08.51]That's a good spell.
[33:18.40]Well, you messed up the whole trap, dude.
[33:31.60]Pins have three speeds they rotate through.
[33:33.37]You can only set them when they're the slowest.
[33:36.19]They only change speeds if they fully descend, so you can tap it before it falls.
[33:41.68]Oh, okay.
[33:42.78]I have to burn that into memory.
[33:50.57]Good old rat meat.
[34:06.63]Cool.
[34:10.19]I feel like I'm really gonna like this game.
[34:18.03]It kind of feels like a different game.
[34:20.77]But I don't remember that much of the first one, but it feels very different, but I like it.
[34:26.08]It's a lot of potions.
[34:37.34]Huh?
[34:44.07]What am I doing wrong?
[34:55.03]Oh, it's right when it goes... It looks really good, too.
[35:10.46]Did they do any patches?
[35:11.40]It's been a couple weeks since the game came out.
[35:13.94]Did they patch any of the shitty performance people were having?
[35:22.79]Or is this just a DLSS?
[35:26.56]Working overtime.
[35:29.42]No, just wait till you get outside.
[35:30.52]Oh, okay.
[35:43.55]It's beautiful indoors.
[35:51.27]The goblin witch did fucking nothing.
[36:02.77]You good?
[36:12.86]A ruby?
[36:19.07]Pretty soul gem.
[36:22.63]I kind of want this shaman staff.
[36:33.70]Why did that scare me?
[36:34.42]That was weird.
[36:39.92]Topaz, gold.
[36:48.05]Oh, great.
[36:48.73]I got to throw out some plates.
[36:49.97]I remember this.
[36:53.58]Uh, get rid of the bone, right?
[36:59.50]Do I need... I don't need a knife.
[37:03.23]I don't need... Uh... I don't need this.
[37:10.79]Get rid of some of the rat meat.
[37:14.88]The sell price is listed?
[37:16.16]Wait, is it?
[37:17.22]It is.
[37:17.58]Oh, shit, it is.
[37:21.82]This thing sells for 188 gold.
[37:23.37]Holy shit.
[37:36.18]So I think this is probably going to be the... I was going to be Dracula.
[37:39.56]I can still play Dracula.
[37:41.77]But I'm definitely going to be playing this for at least the next handful of streams that are not Saturday.
[37:52.03]Saturday we're doing itchy O'Hara stuff.
[37:54.07]Have a few drinks.
[37:56.32]It's Sunday or Monday.
[37:57.10]Probably Monday we're going to be hanging out with Squeaks.
[37:59.74]Playing Switch games.
[38:02.48]And... Then I'm going to be playing this.
[38:05.95]So... Alright, don't attack... Attack these guys.
[38:24.65]Oh my god!
[38:25.43]What?
[38:26.37]Wait, what are you talking about?
[38:29.28]What are you talking about?
[38:35.57]I thought it remembered when I punched him in the face and I didn't save it or something.
[38:48.02]They cannot understand why I trust you.
[38:51.43]They've not seen what I've seen.
[38:53.83]How can I explain?
[38:55.82]Listen, you know the nine how they guide our fates with an invisible hand.
[39:03.09]Saturday's beer streams I mean.
[39:06.03]Two weeks ago, yeah, maybe like once or twice a month.
[39:09.18]Maybe.
[39:12.10]Uh, I'm not on good terms with the gods.
[39:14.87]Oh, great.
[39:36.89]The warrior, the mage, the thief, the steed, the apprentice, the shadow, the tower, the atronach, the ritual, the lord, the lady, the lover, the serpent.
[40:17.65]Hmm.
[40:19.71]Did you do Green Day?
[40:27.60]Do you have the time to... No, no.
[40:31.54]I want to pick it this time.
[40:32.56]I don't want to play the innkeeper class or whatever it is.
[40:38.93]With all my points and luck charisma and I have a knife in my pocket.
[40:51.73]That one seems kind of fun.
[40:55.24]What is the shadow?
[40:58.90]I don't even care.
[40:59.52]I don't need to see anything else.
[41:00.57]I don't want to see any other abilities.
[41:05.65]I want to be able to be invisible.
[41:08.24]And I don't care about anything else.
[41:12.94]The signs I read show the end of my path.
[41:16.37]My death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.
[41:21.89]You can only do it once a day?
[41:23.13]There's way better ways to be invisible in the game.
[41:29.20]Why would they make it one of the religions of the game?
[41:31.70]You don't show me the class selection and, oh, by the way, in, uh, in like 10 gameplay hours, you can do a better version of that.
[41:44.84]Whatever.
[41:47.25]Your stars are not mine.
[41:49.39]Today the shadow shall hide you from destiny's coming hounds.
[41:53.48]I'm not changing it.
[41:57.63]Most people read.
[42:02.99]Yeah, I read books and science reports.
[42:06.40]And tons of literature.
[42:08.06]Lots of Old Testament, New Testament.
[42:11.31]I do a lot of reading.
[42:13.37]But just in a video game, I skip over some stuff.
[42:17.10]My dreams grant me no opinions of success.
[42:20.59]Their compass ventures not beyond the doors of death.
[42:24.23]But in your face, I behold the sun's companion.
[42:27.87]The dawn of Akatosh's bright glory may banish the coming darkness.
[42:33.10]With such hope, and with the promise of your aim, my heart must be satisfied.
[42:38.44]Dude, I'm telling you, Red Robin is good.
[42:40.32]I may have talked shit about Red Robin before, and what a mistake that was.
[42:45.61]That place is good.
[42:49.05]What's the name of the burger?
[42:53.53]It's a tavern burger.
[43:02.68]It's called... It's the one with the sauce on it.
[43:13.91]It's the tavern burger, and it's got the sauce on it.
[43:20.01]Are you bored?
[43:20.81]No, I'm just chilling.
[43:23.46]I chill.
[43:30.25]No, it's got a name.
[43:36.38]No, no, no.
[43:37.10]Red's Double.
[43:37.68]That's the one.
[43:38.58]Yep.
[43:39.56]Red's Double.
[43:41.58]That burger is good.
[43:43.09]Red's Double is awesome.
[43:46.07]You get the fries.
[43:47.51]I go to my grave.
[43:49.27]A tongue shriller than all the music calls me.
[43:52.60]You shall follow me yet for a while.
[43:54.56]Then we must part.
[43:58.99]Okay.
[43:59.87]I like the staff.
[44:00.65]It's pretty good.
[44:03.61]You may as well make yourself useful here.
[44:05.75]Carry this torch and stick close.
[44:07.56]So who is that guy?
[44:08.98]The guy with the blue robe on?
[44:11.26]Is he like a mystic or... Seems like he knew a little bit of magic.
[44:19.78]We're the Emperor's bodyguards.
[44:21.11]Our job is to get him out of situations like this.
[44:23.75]Although I admit, things are not going according to plan.
[44:27.59]I saw the Emperor earlier in the cell.
[44:30.42]He ran away.
[44:30.88]That was a different guy.
[44:33.70]That's a completely different person.
[44:37.50]You think that's... God, some of the people in this chat are fucking so stupid.
[44:41.11]My job is to make sure the Emperor gets out of here alive and I intend to do it.
[44:47.94]Okay.
[44:48.34]Stick close and let us do our job and you'll be alright.
[44:56.23]Alright, let's go.
[44:57.67]Get out of here.
[45:15.90]Come on over here.
[45:18.80]I'm not attacking because I'm going to accidentally hit this guy in the back of the head and I'm going to splatter his brains into the ceiling.
[45:27.35]And they're all going to get mad at me and I have to load the save again.
[45:38.60]Nice.
[45:41.61]I don't need to.
[45:46.03]I can just walk around.
[45:51.99]but I can show us where we need to go.
[46:04.23]Hold up.
[46:05.39]I don't like this.
[46:06.37]Let me take a look.
[46:18.15]Looks clear.
[46:18.41]Come on.
[46:22.75]Can you talk while moving the staff's jaw?
[46:27.80]I'm sure I could try something like that.
[46:32.29]Oh, to be honest.
[46:35.01]Oh, God, hold on.
[46:41.14]Let's go.
[46:55.14]Is that a Red Robin strawberry lemonade?
[46:57.06]Could I have a sip?
[47:04.09]Wait here with the Emperor.
[47:08.44]Guard him with your life.
[47:10.34]For the Emperor!
[47:14.35]For the Emperor!
[47:27.25]I killed that guy.
[47:31.22]Get back with the Ember.
[47:37.92]Protect him with your life.
[47:39.53]Am I out of mana?
[47:42.16]Bro.
[47:42.38]I can go no further.
[47:43.76]You alone must stand against the prince of destruction and his mortal servants.
[47:48.41]He must not have the amulet of kings.
[47:51.55]Take the amulet.
[47:52.77]Give it to Joffrey.
[47:54.01]He alone knows where to find my last son.
[47:57.20]You wasted the staff and the tutorial?
[47:59.18]Close shut the jaws of oblivion.
[48:06.91]Hey!
[48:09.31]Did I fuck up?
[48:11.81]Did I fuck up?
[48:18.96]I don't remember.
[48:20.06]I haven't played the game in a long time.
[48:32.07]We failed.
[48:33.49]I failed.
[48:35.34]Dude, you gotta make a new character?
[48:37.28]Ah, he gave it to me.
[48:43.79]Yeah.
[49:02.09]He always dies like that.
[49:11.50]I must take it to Joffrey.
[49:13.56]I miss when it was super obvious he was really high while streaming.
[49:26.81]I'll see you at Bush Light Saturday, alright?
[49:29.10]Nothing I ever heard about.
[49:30.83]But Joffrey would be the one to know.
[49:33.06]He's the Grand Master of my Order.
[49:35.48]Although you may not think so to meet him, he lives quietly as a monk at Weynon Priory, near the city of Coral.
[49:44.90]first you need to get out of here through that door must be the entrance to the sewers past the locked gate that's where we were heading it's a secret way out of the imperial city or it was supposed to be secret here you'll need this key for the last door into the sewers a key alright let's go there are rats and goblins down there but from what I've seen of you I'm guessing you're an experienced knight am I right
[50:12.62]Well, you would be wrong.
[50:19.34]Because I am an agent.
[50:24.41]I'm an acrobat.
[50:28.41]I'm an acrobat.
[50:48.85]I am shadow.
[51:00.35]Personality?
[51:01.09]Strength affects the amount of damage you deal.
[51:07.26]Okay, so this is just damage with melee weapons.
[51:10.50]And maximum carry.
[51:12.76]That's a huge deal.
[51:18.30]How about agility?
[51:22.65]What if I do bows?
[51:24.01]Is that stupid?
[51:35.14]Stealth archer.
[51:39.20]I like it.
[51:42.75]Stealth archer again?
[51:44.13]Is that what I did last time?
[51:52.56]It's always the stealth archer.
[51:54.64]Stealth archer, stealth archer, stealth archer.
[51:56.75]Everyone's a stealth archer.
[51:57.63]Everyone plays stealth.
[51:58.37]Everyone's a stealth archer?
[51:59.99]It's a build that everyone does.
[52:02.28]What?
[52:04.50]Is it good?
[52:05.00]Who cares?
[52:09.55]Everybody does stealth archer.
[52:12.87]What if I did stealth personality?
[52:29.06]Alright, stealth personality with a bunch of speed.
[52:36.50]Yeah.
[52:38.60]What else we got?
[52:42.85]Should I just beat the shit out of people with my bare hands?
[53:05.05]Stealth, Speed, Personality, Hand to Hand.
[53:10.60]Hand to Hand is legit terrible.
[53:13.67]You said you didn't want to pick the Innkeeper class, but you just chose Personality.
[53:17.15]Yeah, as of 1.
[53:34.72]strength and endurance and hand-to-hand athletics stealth drunkard luck oh there's more
[54:07.86]yeah hand-to-hand athletics oh shit okay hold on oh fuck there's so many more I thought it was gonna be so easy acrobatics sneak alteration destruction
[54:39.22]Illusion.
[54:51.71]Does this do anything?
[55:00.30]I definitely want to do this dumb shit.
[55:02.48]Is this dumb?
[55:03.77]Alright, I'm taking a break.
[55:04.51]I'll be right back.
[55:14.75]Oh, I got a few more minutes.
[55:15.59]I'm fine.
[55:19.62]Alright, illusion.
[55:20.84]I want to do, yeah, charm.

[55:27.33]I want to do color spray.
[55:38.82]Yeah, athletics hand-to-hand.
[55:41.35]Alteration, illusion.
[55:45.75]Acrobatics and sneak.
[55:53.98]And light armor.
[55:58.23]This looks like dog shit.
[55:59.55]I think it's perfect.
[56:15.89]Hand-to-hand is bad.
[56:16.75]It falls off hard and can't use enchantments like weapons.
[56:20.68]You'll need mods by the time you get further.
[56:23.16]I need to mod the game to be able to play it later?
[56:27.37]Don't cave into the haters.
[56:30.38]Wait, it's true?
[56:31.14]It's true, it's true.
[56:34.30]It can get really hard.
[56:49.83]It's so bad.
[56:56.29]Get a stab weapon instead.
[56:57.74]It's dog shit.
[56:58.78]It's dog shit.
[56:59.42]It's dog shit.
[57:01.60]Hand to hand is nerfed and bugged, but have fun.
[57:05.72]Cry can just render the exact problem while doing hand to hand.
[57:08.67]Alright, we'll do blunt.
[57:09.79]No.
[57:13.83]Conjuring.
[57:26.92]Okay.
[57:32.34]Conjuring.
[57:34.24]Intelligence.
[57:37.37]And Endurance.
[57:44.45]With Athletics.
[57:51.66]Illusion.
[57:54.82]Mysticism.
[58:00.92]Who gives a shit?
[58:02.16]This is what I'm doing.
[58:05.71]You're going to be summoning 2004 AI mobs.
[58:07.53]Alright, I'm going to be a conjurer.
[58:15.91]I'm going to be summoning skeletons.
[58:18.89]I'm going to make a bunch of skeletons.
[58:20.73]We're going to take over an inn.
[58:23.40]Alright, let's go.
[58:24.78]Adventurer?
[58:28.56]That's lame.
[58:38.03]Change your specialization.
[58:42.78]Oh, shit, right.
[58:56.16]Alright, fuck it, let's go.
[59:10.80]There you go.
[59:11.74]How's that?
[59:20.01]Mystifying Magic.
[59:22.30]Why are you alerted to space?
[59:23.52]That's a lame title.
[59:24.66]It's the title of the class.
[59:26.14]Who cares?
[59:31.21]Oh, let's go through the classes in Oblivion.
[59:33.31]Mage, Sorcerer, Battle Mage, Healer, Mystifying Magic Man.
[59:42.29]Wait, what the fuck is going on?
[59:50.39]Alright, it's done.
[59:53.03]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[59:56.24]I'll be back, and then we'll play for a little bit longer, and this game's fun.
[59:59.61]I'm going to have a lot of fun with this, I think.
[60:01.43]I'll be back.
[64:06.47]You guys fighting in here?
[64:10.15]What's going on?
[64:10.94]What's going on here?
[64:11.80]People fighting?
[64:15.98]Not anymore?
[64:18.87]People fighting earlier about Oblivion.
[64:20.51]What's going on?
[64:22.39]Just chill.
[64:24.78]Somebody did call me the ad summoner.
[64:26.96]I thought that was really funny.
[64:30.65]Arguing about the game?
[64:34.85]Dude, I'm gonna... I... I'm gonna be doing backflips off the table.
[64:39.00]Summoning skeletons.
[64:41.14]In a fucking speedo onesie.
[64:42.88]Okay?
[64:43.34]Like... I... I think we got a weird build already.
[65:02.63]That sounds badass, but fuck Bethesda.
[65:08.48]Tell me how you really feel.
[65:11.35]Yeah, I'm eating another... It's another pretzel.
[65:12.82]I'm sorry.
[65:18.97]That just happened to be the loudest snack in the world.
[65:36.75]Hey, I tried to make the Jerm a smoothie, but I fucked it up.
[65:39.33]What is the... What is that?
[65:41.45]That's the first I've ever heard of this.
[65:57.45]What is it?
[65:59.31]Do not make the smoothie.
[66:02.20]Yep, sourdough pretzel.
[66:03.38]You got it.
[66:04.64]Good stuff.
[66:10.31]The Kefir and piss one.
[66:15.94]Some of you guys need to go to church.
[66:18.88]It's clear to me.
[66:23.33]Alright, let's go.
[66:36.76]Why you so religious today?
[66:39.59]Am I?
[66:40.17]I feel like I made a couple of references, didn't I?
[66:50.81]What if I loot the Emperor?
[67:05.24]Well, look, he's like Family Guy death posing right now.
[67:08.11]We can't... We gotta move him.
[67:10.53]This is not dignified.
[67:12.09]Alright, let's go.
[67:26.65]I don't know what I just did.
[67:32.72]Where's my spell that helps me?
[67:36.61]There it is.
[67:38.07]Alright.
[67:38.38]Summon Skeleton.
[67:46.37]Uh, yeah?
[67:51.92]He's going to do whatever I tell him to.
[67:52.96]This is going to be awesome.
[68:01.87]I need to set some stuff here.
[68:03.84]Hold on.
[68:11.61]What's moon shadow?
[68:19.80]Can I read the spell?
[68:20.72]Protect?
[68:22.67]Starlight's in this?
[68:34.88]I didn't know that was in this.
[68:41.13]Okay, this is the thing that I got for being shadow.
[68:49.53]Cool, let's go.
[68:55.24]I need a different weapon because I drained all the battery on this thing.
[69:10.67]Where's the skeleton?
[69:16.22]Is he dead?
[69:37.52]Alright, let's do it.
[69:40.41]Can I have more than one skeleton?
[69:41.87]Can I have like ten?
[69:43.55]I hope so.
[69:54.39]You are so slow.
[69:55.57]It is unbelievable.
[69:59.14]They're stupid too, aren't they?
[70:04.98]Oh, this is the worst decision I've ever made.
[70:06.60]This class is dog shit.
[70:16.77]Fight that!
[70:31.03]Okay.
[70:36.26]Alright.
[70:37.79]Well, it worked.
[70:51.83]Attack.
[70:53.55]Attack that kill it.
[70:57.24]Actually kind of good.
[71:04.90]I should make a separate save here?
[71:08.42]Like a hard save?
[71:22.84]Oh, because you can respec everything.
[71:24.68]I see.
[71:25.54]Good call.
[71:32.51]Very interesting.
[71:33.13]Okay.
[71:37.82]Yeah, we're good.
[71:51.32]Okay, so this is the real test if it's going to run on my computer well.
[71:54.86]Let's see.
[72:13.63]Beautiful.
[72:15.96]Wow.
[72:20.18]So this is Albion.
[72:36.53]And by the way, we're not doing any fast traveling.
[72:38.77]I have to walk or run to every single place I go to.
[72:41.88]This is going to be a 300-hour playthrough.
[72:43.98]I hope you're ready.
[72:58.62]There's a sideways cave over here.
[73:02.42]Increase the game's audio a little bit.
[73:05.89]It is a little low, isn't it?
[73:23.88]Okay, cool.
[73:30.52]Whoa, what's going on?
[73:36.76]Something, I don't know what it is.
[73:37.82]Kill it!
[73:53.22]Gorgeous.
[73:56.71]The air's probably so fresh out here.
[74:00.01]Alright, where's my goal?
[74:12.10]Deliver the amulet.
[74:16.38]To Weynon Priory.
[74:22.59]Go anywhere.
[74:23.13]You can do anything.
[74:25.19]Dogs!
[74:26.29]Look, dogs and cats over here.
[74:29.82]Look.
[74:33.80]Oh, it's two goldies.
[74:35.23]It's two golden retrievers.
[74:36.73]Oh my god, it's so cute.
[74:48.75]It's so cute.
[74:49.41]I love golden retrievers.
[74:50.85]They're so fucking cute.
[75:15.58]Okay, as a mage, should I get a staff or something?
[75:25.87]You can breathe underwater.
[75:26.89]Go swimming.
[75:33.38]I'll take a detour.
[75:34.04]Let's go see what we got.
[75:41.98]Get this armor off too.
[75:43.04]That's not.
[75:45.42]What's that?
[75:48.95]Are you going to fight a crab is going to fight me?
[75:55.32]Oh, fuck!
[75:56.52]Don't mess around with these.
[76:04.01]Oh, shit!
[76:07.07]These things are kind of... It was scary.
[76:23.01]That was a little loud.
[76:23.81]Let me turn that down a little bit.
[76:33.39]You can summon magical weapons and armor.
[76:38.70]Nirnroot.
[76:46.12]It's pretty.
[76:54.60]Okay, if you went back in time to the year 1996, and you brought with you a computer tower, a monitor, like a 27-inch monitor with 120 hertz, the mouse and the keyboard, or a controller, it doesn't matter, like PlayStation 5, whatever, and you went into a gamer and you put a gamer in front of this, do you think they would believe what they were seeing?
[77:22.73]Do you think that they would think it was actually possible to do this?
[77:31.55]I would think it was a movie.
[77:33.35]Yeah.
[77:42.77]How ugly is he?
[77:46.01]It's not bad.
[77:46.77]Fine.
[77:52.94]Can I wear the amulet?
[77:54.00]That's kind of funny.
[78:06.53]He's scary.
[78:07.87]He's scary.
[78:24.19]Any secrets down here?
[78:26.79]I'm gonna do every quest in the whole game.
[78:39.41]Bet you guys didn't know about one down here.
[78:47.04]Can I fish?
[78:55.65]I should be able to kill that.
[78:58.35]Nice remake.
[79:00.73]Oh yeah, the game's been remastered.
[79:03.08]Game's a piece of fucking shit.
[79:05.74]Look at how terrible this is.
[79:07.47]Awful.
[79:13.84]Absolute dog shit.
[79:18.23]Yeah, this game needs work.
[79:31.91]I probably cooked the crab, right?
[79:35.35]Okay, the last time I played this game, I do have to tell you, it's all a blur.
[79:39.86]It's all flashes.
[79:41.52]I believe I just teleported to the town, fought a bunch of people, killed three people there, and laughed for half an hour and never played the game ever again.
[79:51.89]Is that accurate?
[79:54.43]I want to take this game.
[79:55.29]I've never experienced this game for real.
[79:57.62]I played it for like two or three days, didn't I?
[80:02.23]I want to experience Oblivion.
[80:10.41]You got a decent amount of time in.
[80:21.34]You got to, like, level 3 or 4, played for 12 hours, and went to the hard... I went to the DLC.
[80:25.37]Yeah, the DLC was hard, right?
[80:26.61]Did I make that up?
[80:33.40]I went straight to the DLC.
[80:35.04]That was the problem.
[80:36.05]That's right.
[80:38.31]I went right to the DLC.
[80:46.48]I don't know what it looks like for you, but it looks pretty good for me.
[80:48.64]Who's that?
[80:49.76]Get him.
[80:57.98]Wait, is this person friendly?
[81:04.28]Who are you?
[81:11.01]In each attempt to persuade, you must admire, boast, joke, or coerce.
[81:15.66]Each of these phrases lowers the character's disposition.
[81:22.41]Okay, you can love, like, dislike, or hate.
[81:28.84]Their disposition increases if you select a loved or liked action.
[81:33.78]Okay.
[81:34.30]I need more speech craft.
[81:42.79]Okay, uh... I just paid this person money.
[81:50.36]How about I admire you?
[81:52.72]Okay, what about this funny joke that I heard?
[81:55.92]Have you heard the one about... Uh... Listen to me.
[82:01.71]I got a big strong arm.
[82:05.32]and um I admire what I you win this one hey I salute you most impressive you win this one you think that's funny what the am I doing
[82:39.12]Not now.
[82:40.10]Not later.
[82:40.76]What the fuck am I doing?
[82:49.00]Such adventures.
[82:51.16]How I envy you.
[82:52.61]I won't fight you.
[82:58.08]I can only do the... You think that's funny?
[83:07.10]You can only do one at once per round.
[83:09.62]Oh, shit.
[83:10.50]I get it.
[83:11.20]Don't talk such rot.
[83:14.41]I salute you.
[83:15.75]Most impressed.
[83:16.77]Don't waste your flattery on me.
[83:20.75]That's just stupid.
[83:22.27]That's enough.
[83:25.14]How do I get out of here?
[83:26.00]I have to do them all, don't I?
[83:32.34]Such adventures.
[83:35.02]I won't.
[83:35.54]Alright.
[83:35.76]Now I want to leave.
[83:36.47]I want to stop.
[83:38.40]Don't talk such... That's just stupid.
[83:40.99]I win.
[83:42.05]That's very good.
[83:49.34]Apparently some fool tried to resurrect the Crimson Scars in Deep SCORN Hollow.
[83:56.77]The Dark Brotherhood will not like that.
[84:03.57]This better be good.
[84:17.25]Just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm not gonna do that.
[84:21.12]But wait, are you gonna get attacked by a bat?
[84:26.88]You know, there are giant bats that fly around.
[84:29.89]You're gonna get killed by this bat?
[84:51.13]Whoa!
[84:53.78]Get out of here!
[84:54.36]They're shooting lightning bolts out of their eyes!
[84:58.95]Run!
[84:59.27]Run!
[85:01.29]Run!
[85:08.04]Oh my god, you killed it in one punch!
[85:09.81]I was just... I was... I'm not going to fight you.
[85:12.65]You're strong.
[85:15.86]Holy shit, don't you fucking see that?
[85:19.64]I don't think she could have killed him in one hit.
[85:28.61]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[85:30.61]Oh!
[85:33.00]And it bites back.
[85:38.32]Oh shit.
[85:41.03]Help!
[85:42.05]Help!
[85:43.23]Help!
[85:44.19]Help!
[85:50.94]Where'd it go?
[86:02.10]I'm not a coward, I just don't understand.
[86:07.51]Why am I running like a fucking weirdo?
[86:14.20]Look at these weird mushrooms.
[86:25.30]This game is cool.
[86:26.14]I like it.
[86:38.89]I don't know where I'm going.
[86:39.88]I'm just going in a direction.
[86:41.58]There was something cool over there, though.
[86:42.70]Wait, hold on.
[86:51.97]What is this?
[86:59.01]Why not?
[87:04.02]It needs to be nighttime?
[87:21.09]Okay, well, I'll just sit here.
[87:24.35]How do I make it nighttime?
[87:31.80]There are enemies nearby.
[87:35.95]I can't wait.
[87:37.80]What enemy?
[88:04.83]Okay, this is midnight.
[88:10.49]Who the fuck is this guy?
[88:14.62]It's a bunch of conjurers!
[88:19.55]I can do that too?
[88:32.92]No!
[88:34.73]Get in there and do something!
[88:46.08]What just happened?
[88:46.62]Am I alive?

[88:57.74]My FOV is 100.
[89:05.54]My FOV is 100.

[90:32.05]God damn it, I gotta go.
[90:52.81]What did I get?
[90:55.84]I took his magic book out of his pocket.
[91:05.11]Where is it?
[91:08.87]You did not?
[91:09.62]He caught you.
[91:11.68]Are you kidding me?
[91:16.82]Alright, I need to do three?
[91:18.29]Three and seven are what I need to do.
[91:21.49]Three is heal.
[91:28.29]Don't scare me like that.
[91:29.21]Come on, let's go.
[91:34.62]Where is he?
[91:38.90]The dude's dead.
[91:43.07]I didn't even kill this guy.
[91:47.41]The skeleton got him?
[91:56.42]He's got some good shit on him.
[92:01.08]Bound gauntlets tome.
[92:03.96]Do you want to add bound gauntlets to your spell list?
[92:07.13]Yeah?
[92:13.68]What does it do?
[92:22.77]Bound gauntlets on self.
[92:26.94]What is it?
[92:35.03]I can punch people with these?
[92:40.98]It just... I get to use Hulk hands?
[92:43.16]That's all that is?
[92:44.07]It's 20 second Hulk hands.
[92:54.89]Or did they make the sound effects?
[92:55.91]If they don't make the sounds, I don't care.
[93:06.20]How many hospital visits do you think were because of the Hulk hands?
[93:16.93]Alright, is this thing- can I touch this now?
[93:23.70]This looks active.
[93:26.78]Marked by a special fate, you rule your destiny.
[93:29.05]Do you choose to steer by the stars of the Thief?
[93:33.19]Is this changing my class?
[93:43.78]It's nothing?
[93:46.90]It's just a bonus?
[93:50.20]Stars of the Thief shine upon you.
[93:51.29]You've gained the cheater's nip greater power.
[93:55.47]Okay.
[94:02.08]Player's spell list.
[94:08.20]Alright, let me go to the... That scared the absolute shit out of me.

[94:27.31]That's kind of crazy.
[94:47.83]What's going on?
[94:58.42]Skeleton actually is kind of good.

[97:27.81]Alright, I just want to get a good view of the city.
[97:29.65]And then I will fast travel.
