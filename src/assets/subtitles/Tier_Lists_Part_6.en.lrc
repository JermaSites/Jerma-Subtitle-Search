[02:47.16]This is a big one.
[02:49.58]Let me just capture my fucking window.
[02:51.02]Oh, this is not a shirt.
[02:57.22]It's a huge shirt.
[02:58.82]Okay, window capture.
[03:05.04]What even is being captured right now?
[03:06.86]I have no fucking idea.
[03:07.64]Okay.
[03:15.14]Alright, here we go.
[03:16.28]This is Jerma meltdown tier list.
[03:22.68]No, you can see.
[03:23.62]No, hold on a second.
[03:40.27]Where am I?
[03:44.97]Some of these aren't fair.
[03:51.83]The way this camera is set up, someone's coming out of there in five minutes and strangling me from behind.
[03:58.80]Oh, yeah.
[03:59.74]Hey, guys.
[04:02.48]Perfect fucking view of that closet.
[04:05.60]No one's coming out of there with a knife.
[04:13.20]It's Halloween, man.
[04:13.92]You're freaking me out.
[04:17.84]You're in the wrong category.
[04:19.29]I'll change it.
[04:19.69]I'll get it.
[04:19.97]What category are we in?
[04:23.73]Legion of Grandmas.
[04:25.77]How about, should I just write Watch Dogs sucks.
[04:29.75]Pivoting to tier lists.
[04:34.27]It really doesn't suck though.
[04:35.71]My computer sucks.
[04:37.14]My computer sucks.
[04:42.28]Tier lists for 10 minutes.
[04:47.85]No, how about just my computer sucks.
[04:49.89]There you go.
[05:03.74]Okay.
[05:05.80]Here we go.
[05:07.20]I'm actually going to zoom this in because... And you.
[05:16.16]Alright, so these are the worst meltdowns I've had on stream.
[05:21.21]Start with Katamari.
[05:22.15]Beautiful Katamari.
[05:25.07]I don't know if that was true.
[05:25.89]That's probably a C. This is Chili Time.
[05:32.11]Chili Time is probably an S because I remember being hurt.
[05:35.12]I hurt myself on this stream.
[05:39.16]Like an hour after that stream ended, I like actually hurt myself.
[05:43.94]And I do remember that being unbearable.
[05:47.12]Dark Souls, I beat it.
[05:48.33]It was good.
[05:48.91]The game was fun.
[05:49.99]I would say this.
[05:50.61]No, Katamari is higher than that.
[05:52.93]Dark Souls 3?
[05:55.93]Nah, not really.
[05:58.37]Dead Rising 2 was not really a meltdown.
[06:00.94]It was fun.
[06:01.50]I had a lot of fun in Dead Rising 2.
[06:05.42]These are up here.
[06:07.22]I think I specifically started... I remember specifically talking about how the games are getting way too hard.
[06:13.18]And how much I hate every video game or something during this, right?
[06:16.38]Hotline Miami 2, way more than Hotline Miami 1.
[06:22.90]Jump King is S. I remember that was horrible.
[06:25.89]No, I wouldn't put... Lifeline's probably around B.
[06:31.30]areo tennis was one of the only times really on stream ever that I was actually angry truly angry upset very very angry and not like oh like like tonight right tonight it's like oh watchdogs hey what the oh that stream was oh that sucked oh no no no no no I was like I hated it every second of playing that game every second of it I was like I hate this
[06:58.48]Uh, I, I hated being on, I hated the stream.
[07:01.26]I hated the fucking game.
[07:03.18]I hated the, the Switch or whatever, dumb, whatever it was, the Wii U at that point, whatever it was.
[07:12.13]Shit, this is up there too.
[07:13.23]Lord of the Rings, the two towers.
[07:18.79]I mean, this, I think this has to trump this because this is the longest stream I've ever done.
[07:22.91]This is 13, 14 hour long stream.
[07:31.95]Yeah, that's probably the belonging.
[07:33.97]Oh, Damu was just stupid and broken and hurt everybody's ears.
[07:40.87]I don't know if Sekiro is over Hotline Miami.
[07:45.25]It might be.
[07:45.71]Especially that last boss.
[07:56.12]Hmm.
[07:56.76]I'm going to leave it there for now.
[08:00.49]Monkey Ball was... Probably more than... No.
[08:06.16]Probably more than Katamari.
[08:10.20]You spent two hours on it.
[08:12.54]On the ape?
[08:13.81]Yeah, that's true.
[08:14.71]I did.
[08:17.13]The thing is S.
[08:20.85]I always gauge on how high up on a list like this that this has to be if I, like, talk shit about the developers of the game.
[08:30.36]That's very important, right?
[08:33.92]The amount of times that I was like, why did they do this?
[08:36.66]What were they fucking thinking?
[08:37.90]Like, that's how I can tell that it should be up here.
[08:48.64]Stuntman Ignition was just fun.
[08:53.33]Okay, now I have to get this right.
[09:03.77]Simpsons was definitely worse than Hotline Miami.
[09:06.39]Simpsons was definitely worse than Chili Time.
[09:08.51]We're going to demote Chili Time.
[09:09.81]Hit and run is S. Yeah, it definitely is.
[09:16.33]Was hit and run more of a meltdown than Jump King?
[09:20.39]I don't think so.
[09:26.67]Was it?
[09:30.11]I feel like these two are on par with each other.
[09:36.58]Have you seen the stream?
[09:39.16]I lived it, bro!
[09:43.54]Why did my face look like it just was going like this?
[09:46.18]That was weird.
[09:51.69]I think this is accurate.
[09:59.60]Because this was not really meltdown.
[10:02.04]This was anger.
[10:02.82]Yeah.
[10:08.50]I think that's correct.
[10:17.33]Now it's correct.
[10:18.93]Now it's good.
[10:22.39]There you go.
[10:23.85]There's me ranking the times that I've... Oh, and where would I put the Watch Dogs Legion stream?
[10:27.95]Probably like here.
[10:32.85]That was just, but I didn't have like a meltdown.
[10:34.77]I just, my computer crashed like five times.
[10:37.67]And I had to download drivers.
[10:42.83]And this whole stream was like a fucking mess.
[10:45.37]But this wasn't a meltdown stream.
[10:46.79]This was a mess stream.
[10:50.04]Behind you.
[10:52.60]You think that opened?
[10:57.32]Shelf is collapsing.
[11:02.05]Make sure you get a good view.
[11:05.11]Alright, next one.
[11:06.55]This is Ubisoft tier list.
[11:10.55]This should be pretty easy.
[11:13.41]Okay.
[11:22.56]I can't even... What are some of these?
[11:24.62]Assassin's Creed Origins.
[11:25.78]Didn't play it.
[11:26.28]Assassin's Creed...
[11:29.13]Reincarnation?
[11:30.63]I can't read that.
[11:31.53]Assassin's Creed 3.
[11:33.27]Assassin's Creed Rogue.
[11:34.23]That's like an iPad game.
[11:35.21]Assassin's Creed 2.
[11:36.53]Assassin's Creed.
[11:37.79]Assassin's Creed Black Flag.
[11:39.75]Assassin's Creed Revelations.
[11:41.75]Assassin's Creed.
[11:43.05]No, didn't play any of these fucking games.
[11:45.09]Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
[11:46.01]None of them.
[11:51.32]Uh, okay.
[11:53.03]Whereas, uh, this is Far Cry Classic.
[11:56.11]This game is an F. I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this.
[12:00.86]This game is not good.
[12:05.92]It's, I mean, at the time, at the time it was a very, it was amazing for graphics and fidelity and draw distance, but the video game is actually really bad.
[12:18.07]It's not good.
[12:22.96]People wanted me to play this.
[12:24.69]And I was like, oh yeah, Far Cry.
[12:26.05]And then I remembered this is the game where people can shoot you literally that have not been generated by the map yet.
[12:32.05]You can get shot through walls?
[12:33.15]Okay.
[12:39.66]No, I think it should be there.
[12:41.54]It's better than Far Cry.
[12:43.48]No.
[12:44.14]Was Far Cry 5 really that bad?
[12:49.20]Do I even like any Ubisoft games?
[12:51.95]Why do I play them?
[12:55.15]I feel like every single one of these I would put in D. Do I like any of these games?
[13:00.83]Although I'll be honest, I've never played a whole lot of the Assassin's Creed stuff.
[13:12.65]This game was good.
[13:14.88]It's Beyond Good and Evil, right?
[13:16.20]No, this was good.
[13:19.74]You know, it would be really great to see Beyond Good and Evil 2 and not Assassin's Creed 15.
[13:37.90]I played all the Rayman games when I was younger.
[13:39.68]I remember really liking them though.
[13:45.88]I've not played a Rayman game in a long time.
[13:47.55]Where's Raving Rabbids?
[13:48.89]That's S tier.
[13:53.39]Don't you think it's funny?
[13:53.99]Well, No More Heroes 2 is not.
[13:56.35]No.
[13:57.11]I'm sorry.
[13:57.99]I have to be completely honest with everybody and myself.
[14:01.00]No More Heroes 2 is not S tier.
[14:10.43]It's very good.
[14:11.15]But I think No More Heroes 1 is better.
[14:18.01]Let's make this right.
[14:18.75]Okay.
[14:22.00]Assassin's Creed Unity.
[14:23.48]I didn't play the Prince of Persia remake.
[14:26.28]I didn't play any of these.
[14:27.22]I don't even know what the game this is, but I know I didn't play it.
[14:31.47]I don't know what game this is, but I know I didn't.
[14:32.85]Wait, this is Far... Which Far Cry is that?
[14:34.23]Is that Far Cry 2?
[14:35.19]Because that's the good one.
[14:39.12]Stands of Time is the only good one.
[14:40.55]Oh.
[14:42.89]Far Cry Primal.
[14:43.71]No, I didn't play it.
[14:47.67]This is Rayman.
[14:48.33]It's going up here.
[14:48.97]Oh, this is Rayman Origins, right?
[14:52.17]Rayman Let... No, what's the new one?
[14:53.74]The one that came out not that long ago, like five years ago.
[14:58.72]This one, this was good.
[14:59.64]This was actually pretty very... Yeah, this is the good one.
[15:06.59]I think that's accurate.
[15:12.28]Uh... Watchdogs... You know what?
[15:14.86]Like, I'm gonna be... I have to be honest with everybody.
[15:21.27]I have to... I just have to be honest with you.
[15:23.85]I really... I don't think these are good.
[15:30.56]They're probably better than...
[15:35.55]problem is like these are like all the same that get all the things that are on e right now are the same game with just like some differences like open world with like a bunch of random missions to do but like one is like a hacker and one you like drive around and like get shot at by like religious people right cult I I put these these on the same exact category like that to me they blend together as the same game
[16:04.64]I think I just don't like watchdogs.
[16:19.71]2 was better.
[16:20.19]I actually do remember playing 2 and it was fun for a little bit.
[16:26.28]It was.
[16:32.22]Yeah, I think I just don't like Watch Dogs.
[16:36.88]What's wrong with me?
[16:40.62]I didn't really like Watch Dogs 1.
[16:42.86]I didn't really like Watch Dogs 2.
[16:46.45]So let me buy Watch Dogs 3 and stream it on launch and be excited for it when the first two games I would put down at E tier.
[17:01.90]Why did I do that?
[17:06.45]Yeah, I'll just say that.
[17:07.13]I gotta be honest.
[17:07.87]I just don't think I like the games.
[17:11.53]I see how people could think that they're fun.
[17:14.38]Backtracking Barry.
[17:15.34]He's backtracking.
[17:16.28]No, I'm not.
[17:17.42]This is a me.
[17:18.66]I'm forward tracking.
[17:23.12]Okay, there's so many games in this list.
[17:25.17]I thought this was the list of things that haven't been put up yet.
[17:28.49]Oh, wow, okay, what's next?
[17:29.49]Assassin's Creed?
[17:30.35]Oh, no.
[17:31.00]Okay, uh, don't look at me.
[17:32.24]Alright, so let this be a future reference.
[17:41.34]Uh, don't ever invite me to, like, an Ubisoft event.
[17:46.26]Because, very clearly... Aw, man, I didn't get invited to the Ubisoft party?
[17:53.69]What the fuck?
[17:54.93]They didn't put me on the list of streamers?
[17:58.17]But I have played 1% of their whole catalog of video games.
[18:04.07]What the heck?
[18:04.81]Why won't they talk to me?
[18:05.97]I don't play any of their games.
[18:12.68]What?
[18:12.98]You mean my name was glossed over when I could have been like a VIP at the Ubisoft conference?
[18:20.09]Name one game you've completed that was an Ubisoft game.
[18:27.76]No More Heroes, and No More Heroes 2.
[18:30.98]Those are the only Ubisoft games that I have completed.
[18:41.88]Every single other game on this list has been played for a maximum of four hours.
[18:58.60]Wait, where's For Honor?
[19:04.64]Where is it?
[19:09.93]I'm sorry, it's like... I can't even see... Like, okay.
[19:13.97]I feel like...
[19:15.53]Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed, which one?
[19:17.45]These are all just different cards.
[19:19.15]You know, like the collectible Marvel cards?
[19:21.23]This is just different artist depictions that you collect in that series.
[19:25.04]It's just like, I can't even just... Alright, this is like the Hulk, but like kind of metal.
[19:29.40]This is like Intergalactic Hulk.
[19:32.62]This is She-Hulk.
[19:35.13]There's... Okay, this is Deadpool.
[19:37.89]Like, I feel like I'm just collecting fucking the cards of the same character.
[19:47.71]Where is For Honor?
[19:48.57]There it is.
[19:49.01]Okay.
[19:49.69]It gets a D. Deadpool is the Hulk.
[20:00.55]Yeah, the only... I don't play any of their catalog.
[20:05.40]I've never... I don't even... Why would I play Ubisoft games?
[20:10.88]These two aren't even Ubisoft games.
[20:20.64]and yeah because every time like the Ubisoft does like a big press conference thing or like an e3 thing I just skip it I just don't even stop watching I think the only time that I ever watched a Ubisoft conference is when I was on stream with you guys I'm roasting them I'm not though this is just me
[20:59.28]That Far Cry 3... Where's Far Cry 2?
[21:06.20]Wait, wasn't Red Steel kind of good?
[21:10.99]Why do I remember this being kind of fun?
[21:19.53]I might be thinking of a different game.
[21:20.85]No, I didn't play any of the South Park games either.
[21:30.68]Yeah, no, this list is done.
[21:35.50]No, I haven't played South Park.
[21:37.78]Why is Black Flag so low?
[21:39.82]Black Flag is so low because it's the only Assassin's Creed game that I've ever played for more than four or five hours.
[21:45.40]And I don't remember it.
[21:47.72]It definitely should be in front of, yeah, above Red Steel.
[21:55.69]Well, yeah, this has been an eye-opening stream for me.
[22:02.22]Just got removed off of all the Ubisoft content creator email lists.
[22:10.06]Okay.
[22:12.74]This is artificial flavors.
[22:15.56]What is the best artificial flavor?
[22:19.90]This is going to be really hard.
[22:24.22]I know that for certain.
[22:25.08]I know the grape for certain.
[22:38.39]grape and uh watermelon Terry's up there too but I don't wear banana okay when I think about artificial flavoring I think of hard candy but I love banana cream pie it's one of my favorite things ever and there's just banana flavoring that some people put in banana cream pie does that count it counts it's just like an added artificial banana flavoring it goes up here then
[23:10.21]I know.
[23:10.73]If I put banana up at S tier, then there's people buried under my floorboards.
[23:14.75]I get it.
[23:15.43]But there's not.
[23:16.89]But I like it.
[23:19.65]Strawberry?
[23:20.35]Eh, hit or miss.
[23:22.09]Second grape?
[23:22.73]Okay.
[23:27.40]I actually don't really like artificial orange.
[23:29.44]Or artificial lemon.
[23:31.54]Artificial lemon just tastes like heartburn.
[23:34.14]That's like the flavor it is when you burp up fucking heartburn.
[23:39.38]Blue raspberry, that's A. Green apple, that's A. Peach?
[23:48.73]Artificial peach flavoring is just... It's kind of like battery acid.
[23:52.15]I don't like it.
[23:54.27]It's trying to... No, it tastes like perfume.
[23:56.65]Artificial peach flavoring just tastes like you're drinking... Like you're eating perfume.
[23:59.33]I think this is good.
[24:12.19]How do you know?
[24:12.75]I'm just guessing, man.
[24:24.41]Watermelon sucks?
[24:25.43]No, it does not.
[24:26.95]You eat a watermelon Jolly Rancher right now, son.
[24:29.97]And then you come to me and you come back to the stream and tell me it was bad.
[24:40.03]Watermelon's the only thing in the right place.
[24:42.07]Grape?
[24:42.63]You don't think the grape belongs here?
[24:50.65]No?
[24:52.11]Grape flavoring?
[24:53.47]Like a grape popsicle?
[24:56.97]Grape is based.
[24:58.13]Yeah, it is.
[25:02.03]Cherry's miles better than grape.
[25:04.20]I'll tell you, the cherry's probably better than banana.
[25:09.59]I think this is good.
[25:12.67]Grape is B tier.
[25:15.73]How could you say something like that?
[25:20.11]Alright, I like it.
[25:22.09]Yeah, cough syrup.
[25:25.17]Maybe that's why I like it.
[25:26.73]Because when I was a little kid, there was that Dimetap.
[25:29.77]It was grape Dimetap.
[25:32.83]And I remember being like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten in my life.
[25:35.90]Whenever I had a cold or a cough or something when I was a little kid.
[25:44.77]You guys don't remember that?
[25:45.89]How it would be, oh, Grape Dimetap.
[25:49.02]And when you were a little kid, it was like, oh my god, it's like candy!
[25:53.20]But it wasn't.
[26:01.06]You're leaning?
[26:03.00]You're a crackhead.
[26:04.31]What?
[26:04.57]Because I said the artificial grape flavoring was good in Dimetap when I was like 11?
[26:10.93]What?
[26:14.43]No, I don't like put it in fucking Coke or Sprite or anything.
[26:18.11]I'm talking about just the flavor.
[26:19.63]It was a grape Jolly Rancher flavor.
[26:23.17]Okay.
[26:32.38]Sandwiches.
[26:34.44]Oh, I'm going to get attacked over these.
[26:36.80]This is going to be okay.
[26:39.02]Bacon, egg, and cheese.
[26:40.40]That's S tier.
[26:41.42]It's fucking unbelievable.
[26:43.85]A grilled cheese.
[26:44.88]That depends.
[26:47.38]Is this a sad grilled cheese that you make at 2 o'clock in the morning because you don't have any food in your fridge?
[26:51.64]You just have slices of cheese and bread?
[26:54.78]Or is this like a hipster restaurant where they give you a grilled cheese, but it's actually a bunch of other shit that they pretended is a grilled cheese and it's super, super ritzy and uppity?
[27:06.47]Which one?
[27:09.05]Because I'll tell you.
[27:11.09]Uh, the one that I make at 2 o'clock in the morning goes up here.
[27:13.53]The one that's from the restaurant where they make it, they like dress it up a lot is down here.
[27:21.12]Ah, that's a pulled pork sandwich.
[27:22.14]That's S tier.
[27:24.14]That's a banh mi.
[27:24.80]That's B. B, L, T, F. I wish I could give it an F. I wish I could say like put immediately into a garbage can.
[27:32.84]BLT is a scam.
[27:35.88]It's a way for you to buy a sandwich without buying a sandwich.
[27:38.60]And somebody made it up.
[27:39.32]Somebody just was like, let me put some of the shit that people put on top of salad.
[27:44.52]Here's like condiments in between two pieces of bread.
[27:47.04]That sounds great.
[27:49.02]No, there's not enough.
[27:57.01]You're missing the thing that goes underneath all that.
[28:00.33]I'll never understand a BLT.
[28:03.56]What do you put on your hamburger?
[28:05.00]A lettuce, tomato, and bacon.
[28:06.92]What do you put on, like, a ham sandwich?
[28:08.08]Oh, I put lettuce and tomato on a ham sandwich.
[28:10.64]Um, what do you put on a, what do you put on a tuna fish sandwich?
[28:14.52]Lettuce, maybe a slice of cheese, maybe, maybe, maybe a tomato.
[28:19.19]What do you put on a BLT?
[28:20.67]That's just it.
[28:21.03]It's just tomato and lettuce.
[28:24.09]And then you put bacon on top of it.
[28:25.51]And bacon is supposed to be the protein part, but that's just an extra.
[28:28.19]It's an additive.
[28:28.71]You got to be something else there.
[28:36.04]Cheese on tuna?
[28:37.40]Yeah, a tuna fish sandwich.
[28:38.14]You never have cheese on a tuna fish sandwich?
[28:39.22]It's good.
[28:40.04]Just like a slice of American cheese.
[28:43.68]That's what a tuna melt is.
[28:44.60]How have you not had a tuna melt?
[28:46.59]No, I just don't think BLTs are... Look, I would eat it and I would be happy about it, but I wouldn't order it.
[28:56.95]Because a lot of times a BLT is like $8 and the large steak and cheese sub is $8.50.
[29:04.28]You're getting scammed.
[29:10.46]Just go and buy a head of lettuce.
[29:13.10]And go buy four tomatoes and a pound of bacon.
[29:15.90]And you can eat BLTs for a month.
[29:20.22]Move on.
[29:21.62]No, this is important to me.
[29:26.16]Holy shit, French dip.
[29:27.46]Oh, fucking get up to S. Are you kidding me?
[29:31.10]Thanksgiving sandwich that goes up in front of that.
[29:33.16]Italian sub.
[29:35.48]They can be a little watery.
[29:37.10]I don't know.
[29:37.44]They can get soggy.
[29:39.06]They're okay.
[29:41.02]Lobster roll?
[29:43.85]Eh.
[29:45.11]Eh.
[29:45.87]Turkey club?
[29:47.63]No, too annoying.
[29:51.21]It's annoying.
[29:52.21]Because you have to open your mouth, look at huge, and you end up going right on to the, like, just the corner.
[29:59.62]You can only bite the corner, and when you bite the corner, every single thing inside just shoots out.
[30:06.10]And you have to, like, oops!
[30:09.26]That's why they had the stupid little thing in there.
[30:18.49]This is based.
[30:19.75]I'm getting a lot of based today.
[30:24.80]Uh, cheesesteak.
[30:25.72]Fuck, I love cheesesteaks so much.
[30:28.20]I really do.
[30:29.02]Fried chicken sandwich.
[30:29.86]I love sandwiches.
[30:31.32]This is gonna be very hard.
[30:32.42]This might be the hardest tier list that you guys have linked me.
[30:37.74]Um... Okay, I don't know what this is.
[30:41.32]This looks like a Kit Kat bar with chocolate taken off.
[30:43.43]I don't know what it is.
[30:46.49]Uh, tuna melt.
[30:47.27]Oh, fuck.
[30:55.34]Meatball sub.
[30:56.18]Fuck.
[30:58.73]A Reuben.
[30:59.43]Oh, man.
[30:59.83]There's too many S-tier sandwiches here.
[31:01.61]A Gyro.
[31:02.91]Fucking S-tier.
[31:03.63]I don't know what that is.
[31:09.73]Oh, Cuban sandwich.
[31:10.64]Come on.
[31:11.78]Come on, Gwen.
[31:13.00]That's better than grilled cheese.
[31:14.48]Patty melt.
[31:15.02]These are all... There's too many.
[31:17.00]Roast beef.
[31:17.58]Disgusting.
[31:18.26]I hate roast beef.
[31:20.60]Come on.
[31:21.40]Come on.
[31:22.45]Come on, let's hear it.
[31:23.53]I wrote, wrote, what?
[31:25.33]Cold meat.
[31:27.55]Cold meat.
[31:28.75]No.
[31:29.77]Give me this.
[31:30.41]Give me the French dip.
[31:31.31]Actually heat it up and put it in a sandwich like fucking real.
[31:35.42]I don't, cold roast beef that you get.
[31:37.70]No.
[31:38.12]It just, it tastes like it came out of somebody's trash.
[31:46.02]Every time that I bite into or smell roast beef that comes from the deli, it just smells like old trash.
[31:55.73]You guys aren't actually using Arby's as a barometer for good roast beef sandwiches, are you?
[32:07.71]Just because they say that in the commercial doesn't mean it's any good.
[32:16.64]Arby's is okay.
[32:21.20]It's not good.
[32:22.20]Quiznos?
[32:22.78]Quiznos disappeared.
[32:27.56]Reviewers are dropping because of this.
[32:29.92]I feel like my roast beef opinion is not an unpopular one.
[32:34.22]You guys want to talk about a boomer food?
[32:36.12]A roast beef sandwich is like the ultimate boomer food.
[32:39.92]You want to be like a boomer?
[32:41.73]Come on.
[32:45.91]Egg salad?
[32:46.69]It depends.
[32:47.69]But usually pretty good.
[32:50.05]Peanut butter and jelly.
[32:53.39]I'd put fluff on there instead and I'd be happier.
[32:57.23]Monte Cristo.
[32:58.23]Too heavy, but very, very tasty.
[33:01.37]B. Torta.
[33:07.27]Ugh.
[33:08.41]A. A standard ham and cheese sandwich.
[33:13.42]No, I'm putting it down here at D, not because I don't like it, but because this is like the go-to when I have nothing else to eat.
[33:23.37]So I don't really want a ham and cheese sandwich with just lettuce on it.
[33:27.48]But if I have to eat it, I'll enjoy it.
[33:34.36]Nah, it's just... No, I'd rather be like turkey with mayo, provolone.
[33:41.43]Ham is... I'm not a big ham fan.
[33:44.15]I'm really not.
[33:47.67]A Cuban sandwich is way better.
[33:50.70]Egg salad is gross?
[33:52.38]Why is egg salad gross?
[33:56.73]You have too many S-Tiers.
[33:57.73]I know.
[33:58.65]I'll work on it.
[34:01.99]I don't know what that is.
[34:03.07]Waffle pita.
[34:06.07]I'd rather it be a gyro.
[34:08.31]Chicken salad.
[34:09.05]Fuck yeah.
[34:09.63]Get up there.
[34:11.52]A bologna and cheese sandwich.
[34:14.10]It's only going to go up to B because it's what I ate every single day from the ages of 8 to 20 during the hours of 11 to 2 p.m.
[34:32.74]It was eaten almost every day.
[34:38.30]These two, where's tuna?
[34:41.59]It's a tuna fish sandwich.
[34:44.80]Cucumber tea.
[34:46.82]It's a cucumber sandwich.
[34:49.99]How have they made the BLT even shittier?
[34:55.45]This is just L. Wait, you just put two pieces of cucumber between bread?
[35:09.54]Somebody had to turn their homework in in 10 minutes and they're in homeroom.
[35:15.32]And they're like, fuck, I gotta come up with a sandwich.
[35:18.24]Okay, cucumbers between bread.
[35:20.12]Done.
[35:20.54]Fuck.
[35:21.16]I hope they're okay with it.
[35:26.04]No, that's all the way down.
[35:27.04]Why would I eat that?
[35:29.34]How about a Kentucky hot brown?
[35:31.74]I don't know what that is.
[35:33.22]Italian beef sandwich.
[35:42.99]Is it better than egg salad?
[35:47.89]It might be better than a... This is not roast beef.
[35:56.08]This is hot.
[35:56.90]This is not cold.
[35:58.68]This is a hot sandwich.
[36:00.32]It's not cold.
[36:01.82]Roast beef sandwiches are fucking cold.
[36:13.32]That's a cold fucker.
[36:15.04]What?
[36:15.56]Is it?
[36:16.76]Are these cold?
[36:18.60]Usually it's hot.
[36:26.33]A croque monsieur.
[36:27.53]Um, never had it.
[36:30.81]Po' boys are okay, but...
[36:33.35]This is kind of boring.
[36:35.19]It's just fried shrimp between two pieces of sub roll.
[36:39.70]I'd rather just have you take it apart.
[36:42.00]And I just want to eat the fried shrimp with like some dipping sauce.
[36:46.64]I don't want fried shrimp between bread.
[36:48.41]This is kind of boring to me.
[36:53.07]Bagel with lox?
[36:54.95]That's
[36:56.90]Here's the weird part about bagel with lox.
[36:59.65]I was just gonna put it up here to pretend that, like, to be sophisticated.
[37:03.65]I've eaten it plenty of times.
[37:06.15]But I was, oh yeah, of course, bagel with lox.
[37:07.83]I'm sophisticated.
[37:08.57]I'm, like, cool and smart.
[37:10.64]But, like, it actually is probably down here.
[37:11.92]Like, if I want to pretend to you guys that, like, wow, look at, I'm, like, look at how, how, look at my food eating habits.
[37:20.34]I eat, like, salmon lox on bagels.
[37:22.67]Who cares?
[37:23.13]Like, it doesn't matter.
[37:24.01]Yeah, it's down here.
[37:27.57]Just be pretending to be like sophisticated when I'm not.
[37:31.07]Liverwurst, F. Veggie and hummus, F. Okay, veggie and hummus is just BLT.
[37:40.32]It's different, some other way, made a different way.
[37:44.76]Veggie and hummus, this is like the Mediterranean BLT.
[37:55.90]So is this.
[38:01.27]Bocadillo.
[38:03.38]Is it red rub with butter?
[38:07.50]I've never had it.
[38:08.96]Okay.
[38:12.04]Let me get this right.
[38:16.88]What is the best sandwich on Earth?
[38:24.34]I gotta be like dressed for this.
[38:31.24]I'm hungry right now.
[38:32.48]I'm very hungry right now, so this is important.
[38:34.60]This is the best time to take this quiz.
[38:40.97]If you presented all these in front of me right now, and you said, Jeremy, pick between fucking any of these.
[38:45.87]You can have any one of them right now.
[38:47.49]And all the other ones disappear.
[38:49.23]Okay?
[38:55.67]Let's get that right.
[38:56.33]Right off the bat.
[39:04.72]Ooh, feeling like fucking Ruben tonight.
[39:06.54]Oh, wait a minute, this patty melt sounds pretty good too.
[39:22.19]Oh, meatball sub.
[39:23.21]Actually, fuck, meatball sub has to go down a full two letter grades.
[39:26.13]Because this is just the thing that's at school lunch every day.
[39:30.29]And it sucks.
[39:42.74]But I love meatballs.
[39:43.68]I love meatball subs.
[39:46.66]Ah.
[39:48.83]French dip comes up.
[39:50.47]Patty melt.
[39:51.01]Thanksgiving sandwich is about to get knocked out.
[39:54.01]No, it can't.
[39:54.55]It's like my favorite.
[39:56.11]It's my favorite.
[39:57.37]But if I was presented with all these right now, and I just assigned my fucking soul away to eat one of these right now, which one would it be?
[40:04.95]It would be...
[40:10.68]It wouldn't be it, Aguirre.
[40:11.48]It wouldn't be a two in a mile.
[40:13.25]That's too simple.
[40:36.67]Mmm, French dip is creeping.
[40:50.64]Oh shit!
[40:51.50]It's... Pulled pork is on the move.
[40:53.56]Pulled pork's on the move.
[41:01.49]Fuck.
[41:01.95]Fuck.
[41:13.55]I gotta knock them down.
[41:14.53]You gotta knock some down.
[41:15.62]You have to.
[41:17.06]It's gonna be harder if I don't.
[41:22.32]Reuben with like fresh, fresh fucking like, oh, sauerkraut.
[41:28.74]And with that fresh, like corned beef, just like shredded up and just placed over like, oh, with tender and just bite into it.
[41:37.82]You get the hint of the sourness from the sauerkraut.
[41:41.42]You get that Dijon mustard, what's on it?
[41:43.64]Russian dressing.
[41:44.92]It's like my favorite sandwich.
[41:46.30]I don't fucking know what's on it.
[41:48.71]I love Reuben's.
[42:01.79]No, but that's so basic.
[42:03.03]It's so easy to love a cheesesteak.
[42:04.83]Everybody does.
[42:08.61]Is it weird that I don't think you're... Okay, if you don't like cheesesteak... There's something wrong with you.
[42:18.64]Right?
[42:19.40]If you eat meat, right?
[42:22.18]If you're a vegetarian or vegan, whatever.
[42:23.50]You're not going to eat these.
[42:24.96]But if you eat meat and you don't love cheesesteak, I don't even know how it's possible.
[42:40.77]I've never met anybody in my life that ate meat and had a cheesesteak and went, oh.
[42:48.34]No, thank you.
[42:49.84]That is awful.
[42:51.80]Yuck.
[42:53.03]Who's ever done that?
[42:56.56]What if you're lactose intolerant?
[42:57.64]No, but I mean, like, if you are of the body of people that can eat these sandwiches, if you can, if you're not lactose intolerant, you're not vegetarian, you're not vegan, you eat meat, you eat beef, if you, all those things, if you do that, and you don't like a cheesesteak, who are you?
[43:19.77]Cheese is garbage.
[43:24.67]What?
[43:29.17]I have digestive problems, and I still eat the fuck out of cheese.
[43:32.56]Don't eat a lot of it, but hold on.
[43:44.30]I know cheese is like a meme, like, oh my god, cover it with cheese.
[43:48.43]The ooey gooey cheesy, oh yeah, oh my god, does it have like a bunch of fucking nacho cheese on it?
[43:54.49]Oh, beast.
[43:56.39]I know, I get it, but it's still good.
[44:01.51]Oh, how can we make a Caesar salad better?
[44:06.73]Cover it with ooey gooey yummy cheesy cheesy cheesy.
[44:11.67]I know.
[44:12.39]People like that.
[44:13.13]And it's like, okay, we're like, that's funny.
[44:15.24]Cheese, put cheese on everything.
[44:18.46]Stop, please.
[44:24.00]Please don't talk like this.
[44:36.06]No, this is fine the way it is.
[44:39.06]Now we gotta go to A. Chicken gyro.
[44:48.06]I love them.
[44:49.99]Chicken salad.
[44:52.71]Egg salad.
[44:53.29]Get up there.
[44:54.99]Especially with a little bit of mustard.
[44:57.15]And if I want to make this even better, I could put some... Tort is better than grilled cheese.
[45:05.21]It is.
[45:11.75]Tuna melt's better than Italian beef.
[45:13.49]It is.
[45:13.89]I'm sorry.
[45:14.31]It's really easy to make, too.
[45:17.49]These kind of are both the same in my brain.
[45:20.38]If you want cold versions, you know, if you're feeling like a cold sandwich, chicken salad, hot, tuna melt.
[45:27.14]Do that sub notification with that.
[45:30.64]Oh, you know how we could make this sub so much better?
[45:32.82]With a ton of... No, people would hate me.
[45:44.79]Grilled cheese is good, but a grilled cheese with tuna in it is better.
[45:47.75]Alright, enough with the pretending.
[45:53.30]I don't actually like this that much.
[45:58.62]Bologna cheese, it's just a childhood favorite.
[46:00.68]It has to be up there.
[46:02.86]Lobster roll is 1000% way too low.
[46:07.02]What the hell was I doing?
[46:14.55]Yeah, what the fuck is wrong with me?
[46:16.76]Lobster rolls better than Italian beef.
[46:27.12]I think it's good there.
[46:29.82]I think it's good there.
[46:36.46]Get out of here.
[46:41.64]Okay, I'm okay.
[46:44.30]Gooey, gooey.
[46:47.96]Alright, ham and cheese, turkey club, PB&J, falafel pita, po' boy.
[46:52.08]I think this is fine.
[46:55.36]Ham and cheese probably comes up.
[46:56.54]BLT goes to the bottom.
[46:58.30]Caprese comes up.
[47:02.62]This goes to the bottom.
[47:05.82]This goes to the bottom.
[47:09.52]Veggie and hummus.
[47:11.38]No, that goes... No, I think that
[47:16.70]Flip of Worst, no.
[47:19.37]I don't really know what these other ones are.
[47:20.49]So I'm going to say sure.
[47:25.03]Alright, ham and cheese.
[47:26.55]Better than a... No, I'd rather have a po' boy than just a ham and cheese.
[47:30.07]Imagine going to a restaurant.
[47:32.05]What do you have on the menu?
[47:33.37]Well, on our sandwich list, we have a po' boy with a horseradish mayo on it and a little bit of a cucumber sliced down the middle and butterflied over there with a little bit of aioli on top.
[47:44.19]We also have a ham and cheese sandwich.
[47:46.53]It's just ham, cheese, and lettuce with just a bun that you get at the grocery store.
[47:52.40]Get out of here.
[47:56.51]Why is cucumber above roast beef?
[48:00.16]Because I think cold roast beef sucks.
[48:03.66]But you're right.
[48:04.49]It should be at the bottom.
[48:08.75]Why is bologna so high?
[48:09.87]I like bologna.
[48:12.00]Fringe.
[48:18.87]Streamer is artificially inflating the price of... What am I doing?
[48:24.49]Rubens, stop watching the stream.
[48:26.99]Rubens are fan-fucking-tastic, man.
[48:28.63]I might have to get one today.
[48:31.75]Why is PB&J so low?
[48:32.95]Because I would prefer if it was peanut butter and fluff.
[48:37.05]Marshmallow fluff.
[48:39.38]PB&J, I don't want it.
[48:42.08]I want marshmallow fluff instead.
[48:46.54]That's a stupid reason.
[48:49.04]But is it though?
[48:50.56]I want- I- I pro- I would rather have a turkey club than a PB&J.
[48:55.76]Buff fucking sucks.
[49:05.41]You've never had it then.
[49:07.45]It's just this ooey gooey sweet
[49:22.52]You know, am I trying to get you guys to not like me?
[49:26.80]I think about like some of the things that I say in the stream and I'm like, and I think back later, I'm like, am I trying to like make everybody hate me?
[49:33.14]Is that like what I'm doing?
[49:34.18]Like, is that the goal of the stream like recently?
[49:37.60]Hey, what can I say that people are going to like hit the X wicked fucking fast?
[49:43.46]Oh, I know.
[49:44.18]This like ooey gooey thing that everyone fucking hates.
[49:49.51]Alright.
[49:50.53]By the way, it's like a million degrees in here, and I have a full robe on.
[49:54.31]I'm gonna die.
[49:56.25]Alright, anymore?
[49:56.93]You got any more lists before I end this stream?
[50:02.33]I've done cheeses before.
[50:04.43]Jurassic Park dinosaurs?
[50:05.99]Oh, fuck yeah.
[50:10.13]Alright, we're gonna do Jurassic Park dinosaurs.
[50:17.12]How can I not save this?
[50:21.58]Control-C saves, right?
[50:24.74]And then it's Control-V to paste.
[50:26.86]I'm getting the hang of things.
[50:27.60]Can we see the community rank?
[50:35.04]Yeah, alright.
[50:36.12]View community rank.
[50:43.23]This is the community rank.
[50:44.21]Fried chicken, grilled cheese.
[50:48.55]Where's Ruben?
[50:52.35]That's way too fucking low.
[50:55.41]That's way too low.
[51:00.18]Where's roast beef?
[51:07.55]What?
[51:11.43]No.
[51:12.31]Roast beef better than a lobster roll?
[51:20.87]Okay, we're going to do one more.
[51:22.41]We're going to do Jurassic Park dinosaur list of my favorite dinosaurs.
[51:27.69]You guys ready?
[51:30.85]What image is this?
[51:35.28]Do faces updated.
[51:36.76]I'm not doing a tier list of my own face.
[51:39.42]That's so megalomaniac.
[51:47.58]Wait.
[51:49.55]Did that work?
[51:53.17]Jurassic Park dinosaurs.
[51:57.09]Do it.
[51:57.47]Do it.
[51:57.85]Do it.
[51:58.29]Oh my fucking god.
[51:59.47]Fine.
[52:00.29]I'll do it.
[52:01.47]I'll do it.
[52:06.31]Where'd your link go?
[52:07.81]I'm not gonna do human organs.
[52:13.03]Link me.
[52:14.26]Link me.
[52:19.30]Alright, I'll do this one right now.
[52:20.72]This one's apparently updated.
[52:24.43]Jerma's face is updated.
[52:31.83]So what am I ranking these based on?
[52:36.29]How ugly they are?
[52:37.67]Or just what they look like?
[52:43.44]Or how much I like them?
[52:47.54]Just rank them.
[52:48.74]Okay.
[52:49.06]That's F.
[52:53.40]This is A, because it's a pog.
[52:55.13]It has to be high.
[52:59.17]That reminds me of the Jerma Rumble, so it goes up there.
[53:01.07]This reminds me of the Carnival, so it's not that high.
[53:08.56]It should be high A. I fucking hate this one, too.
[53:22.51]I like this one.
[53:25.40]Look at how handsome I was when I was a young man.
[53:27.56]Look what I'd be.
[53:30.04]That's just a Photoshop.
[53:31.16]Alright, what about the ones that are just Photoshopped?
[53:33.38]They're not even my face.
[53:43.59]Delete that image off the internet.
[53:44.75]I fucking hate that image.
[53:48.15]This is just me looking.
[53:49.12]Oh, that's fat me.
[53:50.02]Okay.
[53:50.18]Okay.
[53:56.86]This one's fucking stupid.
[53:59.30]I like this one.
[54:00.70]This one's going up to like A. This one's probably A. This is like the Roblox face.
[54:25.83]Like, you made me in Roblox.
[54:26.97]There's a lot of shitty... Oh, wow, yeah, that's up here.
[54:54.52]This is... Okay, I thought this was a screen grab from this stream.
[54:57.58]I was like, what the hell?
[54:58.24]This is... They are!
[55:06.32]These are screen grabs from this stream!
[55:16.67]These aren't even faces.
[55:17.69]You just took the... Alright, hold on.
[55:39.25]I'm fixing the list.
[55:40.11]Hold on.
[55:50.21]This is a picture of me in fucking high school.
[55:51.79]Who cares?
[55:52.37]Bought them.
[56:14.37]Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, you're right.
[56:15.81]Yeah, this goes up here.
[56:18.51]Done.
[56:20.33]Wait.
[56:26.81]Now we're going to close this out with Jurassic Park dinosaurs.
[56:36.27]This should be easy.
[56:37.73]Pterodactyl, yes.
[56:41.52]Uh, Triceratops.
[56:43.66]B. This is, uh, this thing's just dead.
[56:46.42]What is that?
[56:49.66]This is a goofy looking one.
[56:50.50]B. A. Selfie T-Rex.
[56:55.58]A. Weird little praying mantis dinosaur.
[56:59.97]Uh, these things are cute.
[57:00.71]They get the BS.
[57:03.01]Spitter.
[57:03.55]A. Uh, food.
[57:07.29]D. Food 2.
[57:09.31]D.
[57:14.86]T-Rex.
[57:15.88]Hey.
[57:18.42]Velociraptor.
[57:20.44]Eh.
[57:21.30]They're cool.
[57:24.25]What is the, uh... What is, like, the Omega Dawn?
[57:26.21]Isn't that the thing from Jurassic World?
[57:28.39]What's the thing called?
[57:29.47]Whatever it is, I'm giving it an F. What's it called?
[57:35.23]The new... They made, like, a Super T-Rex, and it's just stupid.
[57:43.46]Well, what was it called?
[57:45.27]He's so hungry.
[57:46.33]I'm gonna fucking try to get a Reuben is what I'm gonna do.
[57:54.67]Uh... Taffy dinosaur.
[57:57.47]S. Brontosaurus is so cool.
[57:59.64]Um... It's like Armadillo.
[58:01.50]Not even a dinosaur.
[58:06.36]This thing's... No.
[58:07.38]F. Is this just bones?
[58:12.12]Stegosaurus?
[58:14.22]Mm.
[58:16.11]Whale.
[58:18.27]I don't know.
[58:18.71]I don't think it's stupid.
[58:19.77]So is this.
[58:21.43]I can't even tell what these dinosaurs are.
[58:22.78]These are really shitty pictures.
[58:26.88]Wait, this is a pterodactyl with a T-Rex head.
[58:30.22]I guess it has to be up here.
[58:32.64]For a second, I was like, why is there a human up here?
[58:38.71]Uh, this is from The Hobbit.
[58:41.59]Smog.
[58:41.97]Smog.
[58:49.41]Okay.
[58:52.45]Wait.
[58:54.27]Food gets to be, like, all the way at the bottom.
[58:58.70]Why do I feel like this is just Jerma985 faces?
[59:01.62]What's your favorite face?
[59:02.66]It's just the same dinosaur doing other weird faces.
[59:04.96]Pterodactyl.
[59:13.18]The little ones.
[59:16.02]And a brontosaurus.
[59:16.78]Done.
[59:24.43]Halloween candy list.
[59:27.03]Oh, it's ooey gooey.
[59:29.38]Don't say that.
[59:30.64]Somebody will fight you.
[59:34.96]This is me and my friend's tier list.
[59:36.94]Wait, what?
[59:39.44]Tastiest nuts?
[59:45.03]Okay, I'll do this one.
[59:47.51]Tastiest nuts.
[59:57.29]I don't want to reveal it.
[59:58.53]I don't want you guys to see it too soon.
[59:59.67]Because I want to get a good look at this first, okay?
[60:08.70]Uh, these almonds?
[60:10.14]Almonds S. These are pistachios D C. I would put pistachios up in B, but fuck you for being in pistachio ice cream.
[60:20.38]Seriously.
[60:22.06]If pistachio ice cream didn't have pistachios in it, it would be so much better.
[60:28.23]It just, it angers me.
[60:30.85]I like pistachios, but when they're in pistachio ice cream, what the fuck are they doing in there?
[60:35.31]I like the green ice cream that pistachio ice cream sits in.
[60:39.59]Whatever that is, I like that.
[60:43.30]I don't like the nuts in there.
[60:46.26]Walnuts, they kind of just, after you chew them up for too long, they get like dry and grainy.
[60:51.76]I don't like them.
[60:54.30]What are these?
[60:57.03]Peanuts in the shell.
[60:57.77]Pretty good.
[61:00.91]Macadamias.
[61:02.95]Pretty good.
[61:04.31]Cashews.
[61:05.01]F. Are these coffee beans?
[61:13.06]I feel like you're duping me here and there's beans on this list.
[61:20.68]Are these chickpeas?
[61:22.27]Chickpeas are A.
[61:26.73]I don't know what these are.
[61:28.35]These are like salted honey roasted nuts.
[61:33.54]And this is a white plastic bag.
[61:38.20]There.
[61:40.98]Almonds suck donkey dick.
[61:49.09]Okay.
[61:53.63]What are these?
[61:54.69]These are hazelnuts.
[61:59.45]Done.
[62:03.53]Done.
[62:05.38]Organs or riot?
[62:06.44]Oh my.
[62:06.90]Alright, fine.
[62:07.54]I'll do human organs.
[62:12.58]Stupid.
[62:13.02]Why does this even... Okay.
[62:25.01]There you go.
[62:29.79]Uhhh... Brain is A. S. Brain is S. Otherwise, how would we have Fortnite without brain?
[62:39.75]It'd be impossible.
[62:41.15]If we didn't have brains, there would be no... There would be no Twitch.
[62:45.95]There'd be no Fortnite.
[62:47.23]There'd be no driving cars.
[62:49.76]There'd be no drivable cars.
[62:51.00]It's the most important organ.
[62:57.40]Without kidneys, we couldn't drink our gamer fuel and play fucking Fortnite, and... This is the dumbest tier list I think I've ever seen.
[63:14.16]Lungs.
[63:15.70]You know, how would we be able to breathe in and rage when we get headshot from across the map in Fortnite?
[63:23.23]If somebody builds and we're like, fuck you!
[63:25.67]How'd we be able to do that?
[63:30.60]Without a... What the fuck is that?
[63:34.12]Without a second brain, without brain stem.
[63:39.98]We wouldn't be able to... What is that?
[63:45.04]Without a heart.
[63:47.22]Heart, no, let's be real.
[63:50.00]What is this?
[63:51.62]It's a liver.
[63:53.54]Liver, I think, would be higher up than... Liver would be here.
[64:01.96]Intestines.
[64:03.26]Meh.
[64:04.73]Stomach.
[64:05.07]We need stomach to eat.
[64:06.49]S. I don't know.
[64:09.77]Is this bladder?
[64:11.87]Bladder and kidneys need to be together.
[64:12.87]Yeah, I just made a person.
[64:24.56]Is this a new organ?
[64:25.67]New organ.
[64:26.35]Pog.
[64:32.26]Imagine they discover a new organ just ran somehow.
[64:35.89]Science has discovered a new organ in the human body.
[64:38.97]Like they never knew it was there.
[64:44.35]They did?
[64:44.77]Well, here's the thing though.
[64:49.09]We have an appendix, but nobody knows what the fuck it's used for.
[64:53.55]For all, seriously, for all we know, appendix things just like turn like metal into fucking gold.
[64:59.06]How would we even know?
[65:00.02]We don't even know what it does.
[65:03.83]They do know what it does.
[65:04.59]I thought they don't.
[65:07.02]I thought it was just a fucking thing that's there for no reason.
[65:12.90]It was for grass and leaves and for turning metal into gold coins.
[65:18.34]We know of what appendixes are for now.
[65:24.37]It's there to explode.
[65:25.59]It's just that's what it does.
[65:32.21]There's an organ in your... There's a new organ in your nose.
[65:38.90]Is there?
[65:39.78]What's it called?
[65:41.56]A snip-o-meter?
[65:43.67]Nose 2.
[65:44.03]Gooey gooey.
[65:51.51]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[65:52.39]I'll see you tomorrow.
[65:54.08]I'll see you... Me and Natalia are going to do co-op.
[65:57.16]That's the plan.
[65:57.72]Unless, like, that goes all fucking wrong.
[65:59.26]I gotta... My computer needs some serious work.
[66:04.61]Well, that was fun.
[66:05.15]I actually did have kind of fun playing Watch Dogs while we, you know, we were just chilling.
[66:09.93]Talking.
[66:12.41]I'll see you tomorrow.
[66:14.29]Round... Actually, you know what?
[66:16.21]Tomorrow, I think, starting around 4pm Pacific.
[66:21.32]Co-opting with somebody.
[66:22.10]Gotta move some times around.
[66:23.84]I think we get burpee today, too.
[66:26.62]What the fuck?
[66:29.41]So I'll see you tomorrow.
[66:30.90]Somewhere around 4 p.m.
[66:32.22]Pacific time.
[66:34.10]And then on Halloween night, we're going to be playing some more scary VR games.
[66:40.24]Got some fun stuff going on.
[66:42.06]So that was Watch Dogs.
[66:44.06]And we can all just pretend that we can just burn that out of our brain for a little while.
[66:50.87]Here come the subs that subbed this stream.
[66:52.47]There were a lot of community subs.
[66:53.93]There was a lot of money today, too.
[66:56.91]We got raided by Ludwig, who... I mean, that was a huge raid.
[67:00.39]It was 15,000 people.
[67:02.27]So... If you stuck around from Ludwig, thanks a lot.
[67:08.98]He's a really good dude.
[67:15.02]I would follow that boy.
[67:29.65]Play five nights at Bugleberry's.
[67:37.22]But yeah, we had a lot.
[67:38.18]There was like five $50 donations in bits today.
[67:42.48]And then there was $100.
[67:43.10]There was like three or four hundred bucks in bits today.
[67:45.90]So thanks, guys.
[67:47.76]That's a lot of fucking money.
[67:51.07]I'll be giving somebody on the internet.
[67:54.65]You're not explaining the cashews?
[67:57.27]They're the meat.
[67:59.75]Of the nut family.
[68:01.19]And I don't like it.
[68:01.73]Hey, Ludwig subbed!
[68:04.44]I just saw it.
[68:04.92]They're the meat of the nut family.
[68:11.31]They're very earthy, very meaty.
[68:12.69]They get a very deep flavor.
[68:28.34]Layers of Fear 2?
[68:30.58]Hey, hold on.
[68:31.24]I have a question.
[68:33.85]I heard Layers of Fear 2 wasn't that good.
[68:44.37]It is?
[68:45.67]I heard it was kind of not as good as the first one.
[68:56.77]Play it, play it, play it.
[68:58.45]Both are bad.
[68:59.65]I thought Layers of Fear 1 was pretty good.
[69:00.91]I mean, we got some of the- we got one of the most iconic video clips of the whole stream ever.
[69:07.65]I can't believe that was like in my fir- wasn't that like in the first few months that I even started streaming on Twitch?
[69:17.27]It was.
[69:28.79]Peaked at his fucking debut.
[69:37.39]I did not peak at my debut.
[69:39.83]We haven't peaked yet.
[69:40.99]Don't worry.
[69:44.41]You'll know when we peak because it might happen in 2021.
[69:50.04]Everything that I planned on doing in 2020 had to get pushed to 2021.
[69:52.58]So 2021 is going to be loaded.
[69:57.82]with something crazy every probably two or three months.
[70:01.40]Because it just has to be, because it's been- everything's been dumped and delayed.
[70:17.83]Why do I have a fucking headache now?
[70:21.40]I have this, like, wicked bad headache right now from... What is it from?
[70:26.05]From Watch Dogs?
[70:26.79]Did I get my brain hacked?
[70:27.79]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[70:32.81]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[70:34.37]Take care, guys.
[70:36.21]See you tomorrow.
[70:42.09]Good night.
[70:55.20]you
[71:30.24]you
[72:04.94]Thank you.
