[00:01.75]Hey guys, what is with this LUL boy thing?
[00:07.97]I make a couple of typos and all of a sudden... Why would I watch German when I can watch late night TV?
[00:17.48]I mean, that's a question for you.
[00:23.30]I don't get it because I'm not an LUL boy.
[00:29.51]Every time I write L-U-L, people laugh at me.
[00:33.77]Okay, look.
[00:34.97]When I write this, right?
[00:37.75]Back in my day, we didn't have emotes to show our feelings.
[00:42.78]So if you thought something was really, really funny, you'd go like this.
[00:49.74]But people make fun of me when I do that, so now I'm trying to be hip and be cool.
[00:53.90]And when I do the new one, I'm not allowed to do that either.
[01:02.60]So which... Should I go back to doing... Should I do this?
[01:12.45]Just don't express any of your emotions.
[01:19.55]Ah, that's a nice hot coffee.
[01:22.20]But yeah, today we're gonna chill.
[01:24.32]The next couple days are actually gonna be a little more relaxed.
[01:26.86]I don't know why I keep saying that.
[01:30.97]But we've had some intense stuff going on the last week or so.
[01:35.83]The VR last night went pretty late.
[01:40.19]It was all over the place.
[01:43.15]So today, we're gonna do something that I tried to do a couple years ago.
[01:51.00]And that is play Call of Juarez Gunslinger.
[01:56.94]There was technical problems last time.
[01:58.38]They shouldn't be there now.
[02:03.41]I tested it.
[02:05.77]Let's hope that even after testing, that we can actually do it.
[02:15.98]And then tomorrow is Chill Stream 2.0.
[02:20.62]Tomorrow, all bets are off of whatever the hell's gonna be on the screen.
[02:28.74]We've got some videos we can watch.
[02:31.12]I might just start to... I might just play the first episode of Sam & Max.
[02:34.42]Maybe we'll play Picross.
[02:37.50]I don't know.
[02:42.75]But today, we're gonna dial it back a little.
[02:46.43]And I'm just gonna play a game that I've wanted to play for a couple years.
[02:49.55]And I forgot that I wanted to play it.
[02:51.55]Because a couple years ago, I was really into it.
[03:01.68]Labo stream?
[03:03.40]Here we go.
[03:03.98]Here comes the next Labo.
[03:06.98]No.
[03:09.96]No, I gotta like dial it down.
[03:17.45]Let me make a tweet.
[03:27.43]Cooking stream with mom?
[03:28.83]No.
[03:29.03]No.
[03:35.82]I think I've seen too many intense things over the last week.
[03:42.14]Let's just hang out and play a cowboy game, right?
[03:44.52]And just chill.
[03:45.22]Let's just hang out.
[03:55.24]Cooking is intense.
[03:57.40]Yeah, have you ever cooked anything before?
[04:00.63]It's a constant, never-ending stress in your brain that you don't want to over or undercook the thing that you're cooking.
[04:07.31]So you pace around, you like put your hand in your mouth like, ah, okay, is it ready yet?
[04:10.87]No, it's not.
[04:11.33]Don't touch it.
[04:13.52]And then you flip it and you're not supposed to flip it and you get mad at yourself.
[04:18.16]I can't cook.
[04:19.30]I can only cook three meals and they're like 10 out of 10.
[04:21.56]So that's the only thing I can do.
[04:27.42]So let me, let's get this on the screen here.
[04:33.24]You need to see to believe.
[04:35.78]Yeah.
[04:36.88]You'll see one day.
[04:37.60]Alright, let's get it up.
[04:39.94]Alright, everybody cross your fingers.
[04:48.44]I tested it already.
[04:50.70]But is this game going to actually work this time?
[04:55.42]I'm gonna turn some of this down even more.
[05:00.27]That's better.
[05:03.52]Alright.
[05:06.07]I'm ready.
[05:08.63]Here we go.
[05:11.97]Put the subtitles in French.
[05:13.03]Why would I put the subtitles in French?
[05:15.95]Who here speaks French?
[05:19.46]Does anybody here actually speak French?
[05:25.48]Alright.
[05:25.88]Story.
[05:28.24]New game.
[05:29.86]I told you I tested it, so I want to do a new game.
[05:34.06]There's normal, hard, and true west.
[05:42.48]How hard is hard?
[05:47.58]I can't even select true west.
[05:49.04]Is this... This is like 2010 hard.
[05:52.64]That could be very hard.
[06:01.69]Hard is normal.
[06:04.84]I don't, uh, okay, sticks, sticks is the, uh, I'm doing normal.
[06:16.94]I'm not gonna do hard.
[06:18.20]This is supposed to be a relaxing hangout stream today.
[06:21.16]You want me to, like, fucking clench my ass and try as hard as I can?
[06:37.64]You picked the easiest.
[06:38.50]Why does it have to be the... Why can't there be an easy underneath that?
[06:41.10]That's Ben 10's dad.
[07:08.15]Hell, son, it would be my honor to drink it.
[07:10.73]I'm Molly.
[07:11.62]Howdy.
[07:12.98]I'm Dwight.
[07:13.90]That's Jack and Steve.
[07:15.38]Ben's behind the bar.
[07:16.88]Oh, Ben.
[07:17.38]Ben 10.
[07:17.82]I bet you got some great stories.
[07:20.16]A couple.
[07:21.88]Any of them true?
[07:23.58]Jack, be nice.
[07:25.44]A few.
[07:26.50]What about your shootout with Henry Plummer's gang in Bannock, Montana?
[07:30.74]Is that where you started as a bounty hunter?
[07:33.18]That's what it says in this here dime novel.
[07:36.28]Don't believe everything you read in them dime novels, boy.
[07:40.82]First man I hunted was back when I was riding with Billy the Kid.
[07:44.56]You knew Billy the Kid?
[07:46.44]Damn right.
[07:47.20]L-U-L, boy.
[07:47.98]That scrawny son of a bitch had no fear.
[07:51.27]Wouldn't back down for nobody.
[07:53.03]I heard he collected the ten stars off any crooked lawman who crossed him.
[07:58.11]Is this game good?
[07:59.13]Is it... I know I've wanted to play it for a while, but this is a good game, right?
[08:28.23]I remember, yeah, I remember I tried to play this, like, two years ago.
[08:34.23]Fuck it, let's just play it.
[08:34.97]Who gives a shit, right?
[08:40.90]It was about 30 years ago.
[08:44.46]Billy was hiding out in an abandoned farm near Stinkin' Springs.
[08:50.27]Well, the property value probably ain't high on that place.
[08:52.83]Stinkin' springs.
[08:53.35]I think we're running fine.
[08:54.67]Was that Joe Pesci?
[08:55.73]Why is Joe Pesci talking to me about... I am funny like a clown?
[08:59.26]Funny like ha-ha funny?
[09:26.15]Uh, okay.
[09:27.61]Is there any, like, secrets?
[09:36.83]Well, uh, guys, this is a plus.
[09:38.86]The game runs.
[09:41.30]Press O to see objective.
[09:44.36]Turn to the hideout.
[09:45.12]So it just puts it on the ground.
[09:47.28]That's not fair.
[09:48.56]We're missing all the fun.
[09:50.22]I knew those two morons would never let me through.
[09:52.81]I had no choice.
[10:00.48]That was clean.
[10:01.76]You're inexperienced by killing enemies.
[10:03.22]You need it for leveling up and gaining extra abilities.
[10:11.80]Okay.
[10:13.20]Shift to sprint.
[10:15.07]Wait.
[10:15.73]Hold on.
[10:19.31]I know you want to move fast, but I need you to hold on a second.
[10:21.61]I need toggle on.
[10:25.69]Is there toggle?
[10:30.97]Aiming, vibration, auto-aim.
[10:33.49]Why is auto-aim on?
[10:35.67]Oh, this is for controller.
[10:36.51]Okay.
[10:36.81]Uh-oh.
[10:46.00]Uh-oh.
[10:55.61]Crouch toggle is on.
[11:00.31]Aim... Is it... Okay, melee... Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[11:03.77]Melee is gonna be this.
[11:05.65]Quick throw dynamite is gonna be this.
[11:09.07]Why can I not make it that?
[11:13.90]No.
[11:15.48]No, fire is pee-pee.
[11:17.88]Right?
[11:18.48]Right?
[11:19.12]Right, Twitch chat?
[11:19.82]Isn't that funny?
[11:20.40]I can't make my other mouse button.
[11:29.90]So there is no toggle aim, is there?
[11:32.86]E-O-A-U.
[11:34.04]Next weapon.
[11:34.64]Wheel.
[11:35.92]One, two, three.
[11:38.28]Grab weapon.
[11:39.52]Move hand?
[11:45.26]There's a sprint toggle.
[11:46.34]There's no aim toggle.
[11:49.60]My life is gonna be hell in this game.
[11:54.41]Garrett and his army of deputies have surrounded the entire homestead.
[11:59.45]Don't use it as an excuse.
[12:00.44]I'll take care of it.
[12:08.36]It actually doesn't feel that bad.
[12:14.09]Gunning down enemies fills your concentration gauge.
[12:16.19]Press... Okay, then you press Q.
[12:23.95]Alright, so this is, this is bullet storm.
[12:27.19]But in the old west.
[12:28.17]How do you crouch?
[12:29.49]That one a headshot?
[12:30.43]Oh, these are my friends.
[12:31.44]I'm going to lean on.
[12:56.15]Now let's move.
[13:03.69]Who's left?
[13:04.31]Time to die!
[13:07.02]Who are you?
[13:08.02]Where are you?
[13:14.28]I knew that going through that front door had been putting my butt in a shooting gallery.
[13:18.96]So I decided to get sneaky.
[13:23.91]Is that a person doing a dog?
[13:28.37]Secret.
[13:29.75]Show nugget info.
[13:32.36]The Lincoln County War is often considered one of the most famous examples of a range war in the history of the West.
[13:39.62]Range wars were conflicts over the control of open range, or rangeland, freely used for cattle grazing.
[13:45.17]The disputes were usually over grazing or water rights.
[13:48.71]But in this case, the fight was over the control of dry goods trade in Lincoln County.
[13:53.66]The quarrel rose around a conflict of interest between the Dolan Murphy faction and a newly arrived Englishman, John Tunstall.
[14:01.54]At first, they tried to use the legal system to resolve their dispute, but soon the fight devolved into a conflict between armed gangs.
[14:10.27]Murphy and Dolan had ties to outlaws like John Kinney and his gang, Jesse Evans, whose outfit was known as the Boys.
[14:17.91]They were responsible for the death of Tunstall, which became the central catalyst of the conflict.
[14:24.12]The other side had the Regulators.
[14:26.30]William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, rode with them, promising revenge on the men who murdered Tunstall.
[14:32.38]Both sides were sworn in by different officers of the law, so technically they were all acting within the law.
[14:38.79]After the Regulators were defeated, some of their members became fugitives and, just like Billy the Kid, met untimely and violent ends.
[14:47.48]This has been our top five coolest WTF moments from modern American history.
[14:55.56]Make sure you click that bell.
[14:56.94]We put videos up every single day that are just like this.
[15:01.44]A bunch of fucking nonsense over the course of two and a half minutes.
[15:05.46]And we upload like nine of them every single day.
[15:09.00]Stay notified.
[15:18.47]New level.
[15:25.60]You have one skill point to spend here now.
[15:27.42]It's like they need three skills.
[15:28.54]Okay.
[15:30.40]Well, it's modern American history.
[15:31.86]Yeah, this is modern.
[15:34.70]Okay, so... I remember this a little bit.
[15:38.70]Close quarters, fighter, ranger, long distance sharpshooter.
[15:43.67]I told you I was going to make a few YouTuber jokes.
[15:45.45]You guys knew that was coming.
[15:48.62]Dual Weld, long range.
[15:52.82]I kinda like, um... YouTube, stupid YouTube screamer Let's Players are an easy target.
[16:06.92]Minus two.
[16:12.43]Can I look without doing it?
[16:14.03]Yeah.
[16:15.61]Eagle Eye, alright, Ironsight slows down time.
[16:25.26]That's cool.
[16:31.28]Dual Revolvers.
[16:33.26]That's cool too.
[16:34.02]I'll go Trapper.
[16:41.40]I don't think I want to do this.
[16:45.32]Deep Dynamite.
[16:46.84]Higher combos and concentration.
[16:48.12]I think I'll go... Let's go with the...
[16:52.40]I think I'm gonna go with the Ranger.
[16:53.72]That sounds cool.
[16:55.31]Iron Slight slows down time.
[17:01.13]You get a fraction of concentration like Slowdown, just enough to aim perfectly.
[17:04.11]Yeah, I wanna get it.
[17:13.00]Rifle ammo capacity.
[17:13.98]I'm gonna do Rav Rifle.
[17:17.92]So, okay, points available.
[17:19.08]So now, let's see how that works.
[17:28.11]Whoa, but you can avoid lethal shots only when your sense of death is charged.
[17:34.58]Avoid the bullet using A to dodge left or D to dodge right.
[17:42.20]Are you serious?
[17:43.41]That's actually pretty cool.
[17:56.96]Anybody else?
[17:57.68]Yep.
[18:01.98]Alright, anybody who's left alive?
[18:08.18]Luckily, these shooters Garrett hired weren't the sharpest tools in the shed.
[18:13.26]This is cool.
[18:13.86]A lot of them were saddle tramps or sod busters or drunken drifters looking to make a few bucks.
[18:24.48]The shooting is actually really fun.
[18:25.94]Whoa, who's next to me?
[18:43.64]What's melee?
[18:44.84]Oh, okay.
[18:48.62]This game could easily be a light gun game.
[18:51.64]I can see that.
[18:52.84]Fight your way to the rear entrance of the farmhouse.
[18:56.08]What?
[18:56.28]I thought he was holding like a baby or something.
[18:59.77]That was fucking weird.
[19:15.76]Does this count your headshots?
[19:16.90]Yep.
[19:17.92]Where is this dude?
[19:18.66]This could easily be a crossover with Mr. Mosquito.
[19:44.98]Wait, what about secrets?
[19:46.02]I'm not going to just blow through.
[19:46.92]Hold on.
[19:49.44]How could this be a Mr. Mosquito crossover?
[19:51.72]You know, sometimes people just write a sentence.
[20:01.07]And then I read it for some reason.
[20:04.97]And like that, I was inside.
[20:07.69]None the worse for wear.
[20:13.56]Is there, like, a sneak?
[20:14.20]Okay.
[20:14.32]Secret!
[20:14.54]Oh, there's three in here?
[20:15.66]Hold on.
[20:17.74]How many skills do I have?
[20:45.70]God damn it.
[20:46.32]I really... Crack shot.
[20:53.36]Smart as a whip.
[20:54.74]21 killed by age 21.
[20:57.31]Billy looked at me and said, About time, amigo.
[21:00.29]Grab a gun and get to the window.
[21:02.91]Look away.
[21:03.81]So you were friends with Billy the Kid?
[21:06.85]Yeah, sort of.
[21:08.09]I keep doing these weird Spider-Man introspectives.
[21:11.44]We were surrounded by dozens of deputized shooters who wanted to do us harm.
[21:23.60]That's when Charlie got hit.
[21:25.08]Catching us in a crossfire, shouted Bill.
[21:27.16]Get to the other side.
[21:50.35]Action lever rifles are the best.
[21:51.47]Yeah, this is... The bolt.
[21:53.80]I can feel the bolt.
[21:54.76]I can hear it.
[21:56.56]That's a lot of pluses.
[22:01.84]That barrel just told a really funny fucking joke.
[22:04.08]You should have heard it.
[22:11.51]No, get out of the way!
[22:17.83]We good?
[22:18.83]No, not yet.
[22:31.68]I don't know how many of those cocksuckers I personally put down, but it was pretty clear.
[22:47.71]Even to Billy.
[22:48.87]What?
[22:49.53]What's going on?
[22:51.43]Wait, what?
[22:54.55]I didn't have it too- S?
[23:04.21]S. All right.
[23:06.29]S is shoot.
[23:07.15]Uh, is somebody in a Heinz helicopter?
[23:23.19]All right.
[23:24.49]You directed that order at me, and I thought, why the hell do I have to do it?
[23:29.77]But I win anyway.
[23:32.05]Dumbass that I was back then.
[23:35.01]Dumbass.
[23:37.54]Oh, boy.
[23:42.36]Whoa.
[23:43.92]Many would have fled in my place.
[23:47.65]Bring the horses from the stable.
[23:49.15]Where are those horses?
[23:49.87]What?
[23:50.05]Oh, over here.
[23:50.81]That guy was just hiding behind... He was the door.
[23:54.09]You were heading for the barn.
[24:24.15]What?
[24:25.33]Oh, melee.
[24:26.09]Right, right.
[24:26.69]I changed melee to my mouse button.
[24:32.67]I at least got to hold the page in the Choose Your Own Adventure book.
[24:35.49]Get the bomb!
[24:58.02]Sounds like Garrett hired a whole regiment of hired guns.
[25:07.21]Yeah, and just when I thought I was done with them, all these hapless bastards would pop up.
[25:15.38]Finally, I had the stables within my reach.
[25:27.59]That guy was hiding in there.
[25:29.22]He had the pumpkin on his head.
[25:30.06]Alright.
[25:32.22]That was a fun level.
[25:32.94]That was a fun tutorial level.
[25:55.47]Proud, handsome, and ham-handed.
[25:58.63]Pat Garrett.
[26:00.85]See you in the next German Rumble.
[26:04.51]Right, you're gonna be there.
[26:05.37]Okay.
[26:05.51]Focus.
[26:24.34]Keep your energy... Keep your enemy in focus using the mouse.
[26:28.26]Press space.
[26:28.74]I gotta keep him in the... Put the camera on him.
[26:37.36]It's a little slow.
[26:38.54]Focus.
[26:40.76]Where do I need to shoot him?
[26:45.82]That's not what my intention was.
[26:48.00]But I... When your opponent reaches for their gun, press to draw your weapon and aim.
[26:53.36]And then shoot.
[27:01.44]And that you killed him in a fair fight.
[27:04.49]Is that what that penny dreadful says?
[27:06.87]No, boy.
[27:08.15]That ain't what I meant when I said I met Pat Garrett.
[27:13.01]So let me start again.
[27:14.37]What, we're going to do this whole thing again?
[27:23.36]It's hard to control that.
[27:27.24]Don't tell them about shooting the guy in the balls.
[27:33.35]Totally not on purpose.
[27:37.41]I mean, initially it wasn't, but the second half of that maybe was.
[27:52.74]68.
[27:53.02]70% accuracy.
[27:54.70]Rifle.
[27:55.44]Award of choice, headshot.
[27:58.14]Honorably killed.
[28:02.18]I only got two out of the three nuggets.
[28:03.44]Alright, I got one point available.
[28:06.40]What's down here?
[28:06.96]Let's see.
[28:09.96]Truth Seeking.
[28:14.22]Don't miss any important details.
[28:15.42]Additional sounds and hints will lead you to the hidden nuggets of truth, provided you get close enough.
[28:20.98]That's not bad.
[28:23.48]Or ammo capacity increased.
[28:29.17]What does that lead to?
[28:31.42]Additional zoom while aiming.
[28:35.72]Hold your breath and be more precise.
[28:37.12]You'll be able to zoom even more.
[28:42.19]And this one is fast rifle reload.
[28:51.00]Fast rifle reload on this one, interestingly enough.
[28:57.66]I think I'll do more ammo.
[28:58.80]We'll go this way.
[29:03.15]Do you live on a racetrack?
[29:06.30]No, I live in Vegas.
[29:10.28]We'll get more ammo.
[29:17.97]Seems like it was a bit easy after all.
[29:19.51]Would you like to switch to hard difficulty?
[29:30.93]I can't... What, am I going to on-stream say no to that?
[29:33.13]Hey, you did that pretty easily.
[29:36.67]I think your audience might start resident sleeper-ing if you don't go to heart.
[29:52.60]When he realized there was no getting out of there alive.
[29:56.08]So they locked you up in Lincoln?
[29:58.48]Indeed they did.
[30:00.12]Sentenced me to hang right along with the kid.
[30:07.28]You'd like Red Steel for the Wii.
[30:09.88]Yeah, that game was really just interesting and odd, wasn't it?
[30:19.63]Alright, Fistful of Hot Lead.
[30:23.25]It's important to know that I was only riding with Billy so I could find the bastard I was after.
[30:30.07]Lincoln Jail.
[30:31.89]April 28th, 1881.
[30:33.43]Four months after the arrest.
[30:34.93]He was with John Kinney's gang.
[30:37.33]And they were sworn enemies of Billy's regulators.
[30:41.38]Why were you after him?
[30:42.84]I owed that son of a bitch a bullet for what he had done to me and mine.
[30:46.34]Instead, all I got for myself was a goddamn death sentence.
[30:54.57]Prison break sequence?
[30:55.31]Luckily, it was right around then that I heard Billy make his move.
[31:00.96]This is on hard now.
[31:02.16]I gotta get up.
[31:03.84]I was lying on my back this whole time.
[31:06.38]That's why that guy sounded a little weird earlier.
[31:10.94]What the papers didn't say is that Billy helped me escape too.
[31:19.01]What?
[31:19.43]Okay.
[31:20.91]My first order of business was finding a firearm.
[31:31.02]So I gotta find a gun.
[31:33.68]Do I have a melee?
[31:34.36]I don't think I can do anything.
[31:35.80]Alright, I gotta be careful, because it's on hard now.
[31:40.88]Oh.
[31:45.18]William, I'm not gonna do that again.
[31:51.41]Cool.
[31:52.81]That's good, you get little nuggets of info.
[31:56.81]These give experience, right?
[32:00.60]They give a lot of experience.
[32:05.32]Jesus.
[32:07.08]Okay.
[32:08.50]Fast rifle reload.
[32:09.64]Reload your rifle in the blink of an eye.
[32:11.24]Inserting the cartridges from the bottom of your rifle can cut down the reload by 50%.
[32:14.38]Uh, yeah.
[32:16.70]I think so.
[32:17.88]Sounds pretty great.
[32:28.17]Gun?
[32:29.70]Oh, there's a gun.
[32:30.36]Ten gauge.
[32:30.86]Loud as thunder.
[32:31.92]Oh, a man clean in half.
[32:53.10]Why does this look like Borderlands?
[32:55.90]I forgot that's the title.
[32:57.32]Exit the jail.
[32:58.18]It's on hard.
[32:58.68]Okay, I can't fucking run.
[33:02.38]Huh?
[33:02.66]Is there like a queue or can I... Thank God.
[33:05.96]Should've built this.
[33:24.77]Don't even need that.
[33:30.02]So it'll be good for you, Jerbo.
[33:31.72]Okay, use the roofs to escape.
[33:36.10]I'm just gonna go this way.
[33:36.93]Any secrets?
[33:37.77]What about secrets?
[33:38.49]Shouldn't have shot from up here.
[33:44.97]What was that?
[33:45.57]I followed the planks where I could.
[33:53.74]Why is it... I'm so confused.
[33:55.50]We're gonna get through here.
[33:56.72]Go on!
[33:57.02]Down here, okay.
[34:17.14]Good thing Hard Mode still has the, please go this direction.
[34:19.82]Okay.
[34:19.96]He's screaming right now.
[34:20.68]I don't even have to say anything.
[34:49.19]I'm gonna take this one stealthy.
[34:50.85]Good thing I don't need to reload this.
[34:52.77]Can't really aim it that well, but it doesn't matter, you know?
[34:54.99]Ooh, ammo!
[35:03.33]Okay, got ammo now.
[35:04.05]Do I have to buy the guns?
[35:05.91]No.
[35:14.65]Make your way through the town.
[35:24.11]They weren't all waiting for me.
[35:25.91]Tell us more.
[35:27.85]Apparently, some of them thought I was Billy.
[35:32.43]Ah, that was good.
[35:46.13]See, me and the kid shared a certain similarity in build and coloring.
[35:52.56]Where is he?
[35:55.72]Oh, no!
[35:56.20]No!
[36:00.11]Okay, I'm fine.
[36:06.91]30 FOV?
[36:09.75]Is it?
[36:16.07]Is it that bad?
[36:17.15]It looks like it's somewhere around... How do I change it?
[36:22.67]It's very low.
[36:23.03]Is it?
[36:23.21]Now that you say it, now that you mention that, it is a little low.
[36:26.19]I don't think... Can I not change it in the game?
[36:29.78]I might not be able to change it.
[36:52.90]Unless it's a game of an eye-and-eye?
[37:03.92]You can do it in the config?
[37:04.86]Alright, well then yeah.
[37:06.88]Once we get to a checkpoint, I'll do it.
[37:08.87]I'm trying to get points.
[37:23.05]Thank you, it's making me sick.
[37:24.17]Alright, I don't want to make anybody sick, you know?
[37:30.71]You can disable the screen border?
[37:32.13]Yeah... Maybe I'll do that too.
[37:35.91]What?
[37:48.12]What the hell was that?
[37:52.78]Can I get through there?
[37:57.66]Oh.
[38:04.40]Yeah, I'm up.
[38:05.56]I'll be at checkpoint in like a minute here.
[38:06.92]Playing fourth reload.
[38:23.95]Why?
[38:32.46]Alright.
[38:32.86]I did it.
[38:34.22]Did I not get him?
[38:35.62]It's a guy that is a door guy here.
[38:47.36]I knew if I made it out of there in one piece, no one would put a price on my head.
[38:52.21]Oh my god, what's happening?
[38:54.41]Because everybody in Lincoln would be dead.
[38:56.69]What?
[38:58.09]No.
[38:59.33]Was that another door guy?
[39:00.67]I have no idea what that was.
[39:02.76]And all that blame would fall on him.
[39:06.00]Meanwhile, Deputy Bob Olinger was organizing a posse to put me down.
[39:12.13]Now he's talking about when he went to the casino last week.
[39:35.22]Back to the stream.
[39:36.06]Last tape.
[39:37.68]What I did last night.
[39:39.80]Yeah, played some plucky cards and shit.
[39:43.43]Oh, damn.
[39:44.19]I almost got hit by that one.
[39:49.85]I don't want to talk over the streamer.
[39:51.43]God damn it.
[40:06.81]Oh my god!
[40:08.53]Die!
[40:26.34]I wish I had my rifle.
[40:27.42]I built into rifles, not into pistols.
[40:35.74]I gotta get up there and shoot him with a shotgun.
[40:41.19]Holy shit, there's a guy right here.
[41:15.42]Finally, I found what I was looking for... ...the stables on the edge of town.
[41:29.99]I guess Billy saved your ass, taking out Bob Olinger the way he did.
[41:33.87]Billy didn't kill Bob.
[41:36.35]Sure he did.
[41:36.89]He dispatched him right after he shot David out.
[41:38.57]Are we going to rewind again?
[41:39.69]No, sir.
[41:40.91]Because Bob came right up behind me, angry as hell that Billy had lit out.
[41:45.57]Hello, Bob.
[41:46.41]I said, I think you better let me go.
[41:51.55]He's in a Peter Griffin costume.
[41:53.07]I don't think so, boy.
[41:55.21]Not with my shotgun.
[41:58.12]So we stood there in the middle of the street, eyeball to eyeball.
[42:03.46]He intended to kill me, and I knew I had no choice but to defend myself.
[42:07.70]Adjust your hand position using A&D for faster draw.
[42:15.49]Oh, fuck.
[42:16.79]I gotta play the claw game, and I have to keep this guy in focus?
[42:24.99]When you hear the heartbeat, you can draw your gun first.
[42:29.55]but this will be noted as dishonorable and scored accordingly.
[42:32.33]Fuck!
[42:42.45]Yeah, that was quick.
[42:49.32]You were focused so that your hand speed was 42% and your reaction time was 0.6... 600 milliseconds.
[42:57.48]I'm better than that, I'm like 200 milliseconds.
[43:23.59]What?
[43:23.89]I didn't know I had to aim a second time.
[43:28.29]I didn't know I had to aim a second time.
[43:30.48]I thought you just shoot with the... shot over his head.
[43:36.18]0.3 seconds, that's better.
[43:41.83]These are gonna get so hard.
[44:05.01]Got it!
[44:05.39]Ooh.
[44:05.47]New skills.
[44:05.97]Uh... What is this one?
[44:35.43]It's not just pretty, but an engineering masterpiece.
[44:38.75]And a very deadly firearm.
[44:40.05]The simplified trigger mechanism and longer barrel.
[44:43.40]Faster rate of fire and better handling.
[44:46.74]And then ultimately we get the golden rifle.
[44:51.06]Quick fingers.
[44:53.68]Reload rate increased by smashing handle...
[44:57.19]Okay.
[44:57.31]I already got a legendary weapon?
[44:58.63]Jesus.
[45:21.88]already a legendary okay so uh I want to let's just continue for a second let me get the loading screen there get the save point in the top right and then I'm going to change the fov where'd you go after lincoln mexico until I realized nobody was looking for me I ended up taking a job at the ruralis the mexican ruralis I was hired to help them track down the cowboys
[45:51.11]The most vicious outlaw gang in Cochise County?
[45:54.38]Curly Bill Brocious?
[45:55.92]Johnny Ringo?
[45:57.02]Led by old man Clint himself.
[46:00.24]They must have paid you a pretty penny to take them hombres home.
[46:04.18]Not really.
[46:05.71]But truth be told, I had my own reasons for going after those boys.
[46:11.31]So, somebody said that this game only has like five levels.
[46:15.75]Are you telling me I'm more than halfway through the whole game?
[46:27.07]No, that doesn't make any sense.
[46:28.55]This game's not 20 minutes long.
[46:36.79]Alright, so.
[46:37.77]Uh, I got new Nuggets of Truth.
[46:41.96]Already saw them.
[46:43.22]Let me just quit out and go to the I&I.
[46:47.58]Is it really that simple?
[46:48.52]It's not a bunch of bullshit where I have to... I can just do it in the I&I, right?
[47:03.83]Hopefully.
[47:04.43]Yeah, the INI.
[47:04.97]Yeah, it's in the INI.
[47:06.57]Okay.
[47:09.04]Give me a second.
[47:10.58]I'm gonna put the BRB screen up just to have it up.
[47:16.94]We'll put it on 90.
[47:17.46]Oh, there's actually like a Steam discussion link that somebody put up.
[47:30.57]Okay.
[47:30.69]Okay.
[47:32.28]Let's see.
[47:33.42]FOV.
[47:35.34]Navigate to your settings.
[47:38.35]Drag video SCR onto notepad to edit its contents.
[47:42.67]Pretty self-explanatory.
[47:47.97]360 degree FOV.
[47:49.17]No, I can't do that.
[47:52.52]Okay, so we're going to go to users.
[47:57.30]Mm-hmm.
[48:01.11]You gotta go into the actual app data, huh?
[48:04.21]Oh, that's annoying.
[48:11.84]Let me open up my app data then.
[48:27.27]App data.
[48:29.27]It's kind of hard to get there on Windows 10.
[48:30.51]You have to search for it.
[48:33.88]Local... Wait, Techland made this game?
[48:49.16]Shit, it might not be here.
[48:52.42]No, this is like a Windows 7, like, tutorial.
[48:56.89]I'm gonna have to do, yeah, local app data.
[49:06.22]Local app data.
[49:09.86]Is Techland in here?
[49:12.30]Techland, there it is.
[49:14.26]Gunslinger.
[49:16.90]Out settings.
[49:18.44]Here we go, video.
[49:23.33]All right, so let's hope this doesn't break the game.
[49:28.92]So now we're going to drag this onto Notepad, or just open it with Notepad.
[49:33.47]I'm going to turn off.
[49:49.04]Notepad.
[49:49.76]I need to put it on the desktop.
[49:55.02]How do I drag this?
[49:55.80]How do I drag this onto Notepad, though?
[50:00.86]Because notepad, I can't open this with notepad for some reason.
[50:07.49]Send to open, I can't open it with.
[50:12.01]Yeah, usually I just right click and then open with.
[50:14.01]There is no open with on this because it's like an SCR file.
[50:21.58]Let's just, okay, notepad.
[50:25.78]New notepad.
[50:33.51]Yeah, pretty much every file you can do that.
[50:35.09]It says, so I got test, configure, install, share, give access to.
[50:41.37]Like give access to is where open with.
[50:48.28]It usually is.
[50:56.14]What is test?
[50:56.60]Test.
[51:08.19]What if I just drag it into notepad?
[51:10.95]Like into that, okay.
[51:12.43]I thought I had to open it with notepad.
[51:13.91]I can just drag it into a new notepad.
[51:16.05]All right, I got it.
[51:16.45]I got it.
[51:16.67]I'm good to go.
[51:17.87]All right, so let's do.
[51:21.69]So I got to add forced horizontal FOV.
[51:26.99]Forced.
[51:30.68]Make sure I spell this shit right.
[51:33.24]Forced.
[51:35.85]Whores.
[51:38.21]Forced Whores FOV.
[51:42.24]Forced Whores FOV, and then in brackets, 90.
[51:44.56]Okay.
[51:52.43]So, now... How do I get rid of some of the other dumb shit?
[51:56.79]I'm only gonna do this once.
[52:00.01]How do I get rid of the stuff on the top and the bottom?
[52:03.90]Forced Whore is FOV.
[52:05.08]Forced Whore is FOV 90.
[52:20.79]What?
[52:20.99]What are you talking about?
[52:28.32]Oh.
[52:29.52]Unless there's like a... Anyone's got an ad.
[52:31.50]Yeah.
[52:31.86]Phrasing.
[52:32.42]Yeah.
[52:33.00]Yeah.
[52:35.48]Alright, how do I remove the vignette?
[52:38.18]Do I have to do that here too?
[52:39.50]Because I don't see it here.
[52:41.62]I mean, FX level, full dynamic shader path.
[52:49.58]Mmm, filter, I don't see it here.
[52:53.42]Gamma float?
[53:00.68]Disable, there it is.
[53:01.94]Okay, so disable screen border.
[53:03.60]Disable the hand-painted comic border.
[53:08.60]Do I do say, yeah, like, okay, here, look.
[53:12.15]Do I put one in here?
[53:20.39]Like, in the brackets, do I put one?
[53:21.91]Or do I just get rid of the exclamation point?
[53:44.23]Delete the bars.
[53:46.55]Just do what the guide, well the guide doesn't say, it doesn't say anything, does it?
[53:50.85]Hold on.
[53:52.94]You can delete this file and run the game to reset the default settings.
[53:57.64]It doesn't, it just says, there's like I-S-F, I-S-F, I-S-F.
[54:06.41]Delete the exclamation point, it doesn't disable it otherwise, okay?
[54:11.03]So, deleting that exclamation point.
[54:16.44]Okay, that should work.
[54:17.50]Okay.
[54:24.01]I'm going to save this now.
[54:25.05]Let me make sure it actually saved it.
[54:45.43]Okay.
[54:46.87]Let's open it and let's hope it doesn't break it.
[54:58.50]The joys of running old games on Windows 10.
[55:00.64]Yeah.
[55:03.54]That should be good, though.
[55:05.33]Thank you for your patience.
[55:16.04]Coming back.
[55:23.28]Jesus.
[55:26.06]Why?
[55:28.55]This is... Still a trend that no one seems to want to solve.
[55:38.15]The default FOV was 82, by the way.
[55:41.12]Okay.
[55:43.98]Well, that makes sense.
[55:46.80]Because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either.
[55:55.43]Okay.
[55:56.21]Here we go.
[55:57.49]Story.
[55:59.47]Continue.
[56:01.95]Did it work?
[56:03.27]Are we good?
[56:20.56]Fuck.
[56:20.80]Is it read only?
[56:21.48]Set the file to read only, ahhh.
[56:22.90]Did I add more screen border?
[56:53.51]Did I add another layer?
[56:54.95]An extra border?
[56:59.53]No, I tried to... This is freaking me out now.
[57:11.62]Oh, wait.
[57:12.32]So the FOV may have changed.
[57:16.64]And the border is now showing... Okay.
[57:20.40]God damn it.
[57:21.02]Alright.
[57:21.22]Ugh.
[57:27.39]Just make it nothing but water.
[57:33.85]Whatever.
[57:34.25]All right, still playing on hearts, so I got to remember that.
[57:57.17]Just clip it in OBS?
[57:58.31]Yeah, but that would make the FOV bad for you guys, because it would zoom you guys in.
[58:03.36]So I would change the FOV to 90, and then change it back to 80-something, because I have to zoom it in.
[58:10.38]Oh, this is the new shooter, okay.
[58:17.63]It was then I wondered if the rocks weren't hiding more bandits.
[58:21.12]Was that all of them?
[58:22.38]Or did I just hit the rear guard?
[58:24.40]I quickly got my answer.
[58:26.17]They attack from on high like a patchy dolphin deer.
[58:33.66]I need a rifle for this one.
[58:34.70]What?
[58:34.92]What?
[58:35.10]The FOV fucked up my video game.
[58:36.48]Those were all headshots.
[58:38.04]All of them.
[58:51.18]What the fuck?
[58:51.86]Okay.
[59:17.55]Look at that.
[59:17.99]Look at that!
[59:18.63]Look at that.
[59:19.03]I'm gonna die.
[59:19.31]I'm gonna die.
[59:19.85]I'm gonna die.
[59:20.23]I'm gonna die.
[59:44.28]But to get to Ringo, I knew I'd have to find my way past these other assholes first.
[59:55.87]Goddamn.
[59:56.21]Ammo's right here.
[59:56.89]What are you talking about?
[60:07.99]I've got plenty of ammo.
[60:08.89]No, no, no, pick up... What is... Dude, this is like too many people!
[60:42.53]He finally did it!
[60:46.03]This narration!
[60:51.39]It's on hard mode, it's alright.
[60:53.55]I'll get good, don't worry.
[60:58.85]Hold on, he's resetting here?
[61:04.68]Why would it zoom in over there?
[61:07.04]I'm looking over here!
[61:15.88]Finally.
[61:18.20]Do you see how many fucking people are here, guys?
[61:29.29]Holy shit.
[61:30.11]What?
[61:44.27]That was fucking perfect.
[61:47.55]Was I supposed to find that?
[61:52.54]Oh my god, I have no gun.
[61:53.62]I have one bullet!
[62:06.75]Why would you turn?
[62:07.67]I'm trying to run away and he like whips his head around and stares at the guy.
[62:16.05]Oh God damn it.
[62:18.73]I need ammo first.
[62:39.86]Whatever, I got... Where's that shotgun?
[62:47.28]Why do I have one fucking bullet in the shotgun?
[63:13.23]Same guy, yeah.
[63:14.29]Tried to get me again.
[63:23.80]Uh, thank you.
[63:25.02]Billy the Kid's massive dong for the thousand dollars.
[63:28.51]I appreciate it.
[63:29.37]Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[63:31.25]So I just kept running.
[63:32.13]You know, I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[63:33.69]What?
[63:33.83]Was that supposed to just be there, or was it supposed to fall down?
[63:53.26]I don't... Oh, I have ammo now.
[63:54.76]Oh, it's a joke.
[63:55.40]Oh, okay.
[63:55.86]It's supposed to.
[63:56.74]Unreliable narrator.
[63:57.34]Yep.
[63:58.02]Ah!
[64:19.12]It was time to turn the table.
[64:20.74]I didn't know what it was like.
[64:23.00]Now I'm chasing them with dynamite.
[64:25.58]Time for the hunted to become the hunted.
[64:30.19]Alright, jeez.
[64:31.25]We get it.
[64:32.77]They were right where you wanted them.
[64:37.05]I was done running.
[64:39.23]That was just an explosive New Vegas build.
[64:42.60]That's true.
[64:43.64]I'm just playing Fallout.
[64:45.84]Oh, fuck!
[64:46.12]I really want to get rid of this...
[65:09.47]Water Frankie mean as hell old man Clinton Turns out that was a bad idea is why would you ever announce your position and have somebody shoot you with a fucking minigun I
[65:40.25]But I knew I could not let that deter me.
[65:45.91]Not if I was to find and kill Ringo.
[65:50.77]I needed to get that old man off that gut.
[65:53.17]Alright, I'm gonna get up there.
[65:57.16]Do I have a rifle?
[66:00.00]Where's the next place to go?
[66:05.20]Over there.
[66:20.51]I was really, really greedy there.
[66:21.69]It's okay.
[66:26.05]Where is he?
[66:26.47]He's up... I'm gonna hit him right in the head.
[66:28.73]Watch this, ready?
[66:50.71]That's why you guys all play, like, Fortnite and Apex and shit like that.
[66:54.26]I figured it out.
[66:54.82]I know why.
[66:57.40]You want to do that long-range shot and have it go like, bang!
[67:09.29]My hands were off the... I didn't have my hands on the keyboard or anything.
[67:12.87]I was at my... Okay.
[67:15.46]I got tanked up on.
[67:16.48]I'm fine.
[67:18.07]I... I can't even turn my camera on.
[67:20.29]I was putting my fingers up towards my mouth and talking and moving my hands.
[67:23.45]It's alright, I'm right here.
[67:35.04]Um... I don't even... I don't know what the fuck that was.
[67:43.84]Can I sneak up around and shoot him in the head?
[68:17.30]I shot him in the head three times.
[68:24.97]No, I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna get up there, I'm gonna put two in his chest.
[68:27.59]Ready?
[68:40.30]He even pulled his knife out, and the gun was still shooting.
[68:55.26]This thing is a turret.
[69:03.22]Alright, I was gonna do it this way.
[69:09.19]Is he gonna shoot?
[69:16.52]What's he doing?
[69:19.38]What the fuck is he doing?
[69:28.58]Is he being blocked by that one little thing in the middle?
[69:47.68]He's head glitching.
[69:55.20]Why do bullet holes appear on the screen when you get hit?
[69:57.20]Because I'm in a car.
[69:58.50]There's a windshield in front of me.
[70:02.44]I got really, really thick gamer glasses on, that's why.
[70:06.43]Apparently one of the cowboys made it out of there alive.
[70:13.18]Okay.
[70:13.32]Headshot.
[70:13.70]Didn't get any nuggets of truth.
[70:14.52]Bad.
[70:14.68]Alright, but hold on.
[70:15.36]Did you want...
[70:44.77]I should get some of these.
[70:45.55]If I'm playing on hard mode, then... Close combat resistance.
[70:51.15]You can't be bulletproof, but you can be more resistant.
[70:54.81]Yeah.
[70:59.61]What's this next one down here?
[71:02.45]Pick your targets faster.
[71:03.37]Your speed of aiming any weapon will be increased by 30%.
[71:05.24]I want this, though, too.
[71:08.38]More zoom.
[71:10.08]Yeah, fuck it, dude.
[71:11.28]We're doing this whole game.
[71:12.44]I'm gonna beat this whole game today.
[71:14.34]This game's awesome.
[71:17.26]I want the zoom.
[71:23.49]Yeah, I want this.
[71:42.50]Gonna be a 30-minute stream.
[71:49.89]When I take my first pee break, I'm gonna desperately try to remove this border.
[71:54.07]I'm gonna go shove the piss out of me as fast as I can, get back here and try to delete that border.
[71:59.78]Not yet, though.
[72:00.20]I'm not gonna do that now.
[72:01.84]Not yet.
[72:06.54]A few weeks after that dust-up at the OK Corral, I was still after Johnny Ringo.
[72:13.48]Okay, I got only 10 shots?
[72:14.30]What is that bullshit?
[72:14.99]Alright, this is the point of the game where I stealth.
[72:44.66]Somebody's coming!
[72:48.96]So what exactly did Johnny Ringo do to piss you off?
[72:53.24]Well, him and that other bastard.
[72:55.38]Roscoe Bob Bright?
[72:56.74]Yep.
[72:58.04]They both deserve to die.
[73:00.00]Oh, nice dual commentary.
[73:02.89]But first I need to tell you about the cowboy's new boss, Curly Bill Brocious.
[73:08.69]What happened there?
[73:09.45]Get ready, boys.
[73:14.09]Runner, plus a hundred.
[73:15.23]Look at that reaction time.
[73:19.91]It's fucking inhuman.
[73:53.56]It was on him!
[73:54.61]Oh, that was his death animation.
[73:56.57]It's alright.
[73:57.41]Alright, don't use all these bullets.
[74:34.47]Nice, alright.
[74:37.84]So, what's the sound?
[74:38.94]There's an indicator now that I have that level up.
[74:43.00]Oh god.
[74:49.78]Was that a... Did I fail it?
[74:53.18]Why did I fail?
[74:53.72]Check this.
[75:08.98]But I wasn't about to let Ringo walk away unscathed.
[75:12.84]And that's what drove me home.
[75:19.21]Come on.
[75:20.85]Come on.
[75:26.47]They say that Ringo was infernally fast.
[75:30.23]Hardly saw anyone faster, boy.
[75:32.18]Ooh, ammo.
[75:32.90]That man was all hat and no cap.
[75:41.28]Drop it.
[75:43.52]I can't drop that.
[75:46.02]They never charge anyone for the murder of Morgan earth Everybody knew that curly shot him in the back that was common knowledge.
[76:01.21]I
[76:03.03]Maybe so but Ringo had nothing to do with it.
[76:06.63]He was just being you need to aim at it I did is that what you call it?
[76:12.29]being loyal Right in the rope to get that loyal friend.
[76:16.73]I had to pass by some buzz saws as big as a man.
[76:19.58]Oh
[76:35.22]Alright, when they get close it scares me.
[76:36.56]Oh, that's full rifle ammo.
[76:38.98]Very cool.
[76:39.42]Make your way through the sawmill.
[77:05.32]Get to the lumber yard and find Curly Bill.
[77:12.83]What do I need these for?
[77:34.33]It actually was kind of easy.
[77:38.63]It was pretty easy.
[77:42.39]Nice!
[78:03.59]Alright, I'm gonna save the other ones.
[78:14.46]Don't undermine the storyteller.
[78:17.48]Yeah, I forget.
[78:18.40]He's giving his tale.
[78:19.72]He's telling his tall tale.
[78:20.98]That's not even true.
[78:25.44]He's embellishing on everything he's ever done or ever said.
[78:32.40]Inflating his- this guy really is a streamer, isn't he?
[78:34.42]Alright, let's get up here.
[78:45.24]Uh-oh.
[78:58.67]That collective turnaround, that like, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
[79:03.06]I didn't get killed by it.
[79:03.84]That's the good thing.
[79:04.72]I accidentally avoided that.
[79:35.42]Why would there be a big barn here?
[79:37.38]Secret?
[79:47.17]Secret?
[79:47.49]I don't think there's any... Wait.
[79:52.98]That sounded like a secret.
[80:03.26]And where was Curly Bill?
[80:04.42]Did you see him?
[80:06.05]I'm about to get to that, Ben.
[80:07.79]Patience.
[80:10.25]I'm painting a picture here.
[80:12.67]It was this beautiful waterfall and a crystal clear stream that led to a verdant valley that was truly... Consider your picture painted.
[80:21.08]What happened next?
[80:22.16]Well, finally the bastards that were still alive made a last stand.
[80:25.98]How does... Let me see.
[80:33.74]No.
[80:44.19]No.
[80:44.43]I'm gonna keep what I have.
[80:48.81]Alright, last stand incoming.
[81:06.59]Curly Bill in here?
[81:07.53]What the fuck?
[81:17.07]Ow.
[81:21.71]Wait, what am I doing?
[81:24.16]Did I just go... Did I just ruin everything?
[81:26.84]Okay.
[81:35.36]I guess I was just... No, here comes another one of these.
[81:39.99]Takes a shot before he takes a swig.
[81:48.56]Defeat Curly Bill.
[81:50.91]Oh, that is Curly Bill, right there.
[81:53.29]Oh, Jesus.
[81:53.71]There's a Metal Gear Solid boss that's just like this.
[81:57.11]It's freaking me out.
[82:31.30]Got him.
[82:48.63]Ow.
[82:48.87]Oh, God.
[82:49.59]What?
[82:50.43]Which way?
[82:55.44]This is a fucking Looney Tunes fight.
[82:58.36]We're both aiming really close and missing.
[83:05.56]Ow.
[83:21.24]That scream.
[83:23.40]He's like, no, please!
[83:40.05]Where?
[83:41.43]That wasn't even him.
[83:44.33]Fuck!
[83:48.34]Dammit.
[83:55.62]Oh, oh!
[84:12.68]What?
[84:42.91]This whole story is being told out of order and incorrectly.
[84:50.83]Next in line to take over.
[84:55.13]Johnny Ringo.
[85:04.62]Shut the fuck up, I'm trying to concentrate.
[85:13.82]Get me killed, you fucking idiot.
[85:21.24]We'll talk later.
[85:41.49]Alright, let me be real with you guys.
[85:44.30]Back... That's probably how all these duels ended.
[85:51.48]Yeah, I know.
[85:52.18]You get the story.
[85:53.67]Here it comes.
[85:54.83]Pulls it out.
[85:55.31]Shoots him.
[85:57.53]These guys probably got... These bullets were small.
[85:59.45]The guns were fucked up.
[86:00.51]They jammed all the time.
[86:01.45]They didn't work half the time.
[86:03.93]These guys were probably lying on the ground just shooting back and forth at each other until one of them died.
[86:11.42]Half the bolts didn't come out.
[86:15.27]They probably be like, ah, fuck!
[86:16.57]And the other guy just shot.
[86:17.59]Hits the other guy.
[86:18.23]They both fall down.
[86:19.05]They crawl off of their guns, shooting at each other.
[86:20.57]That's incredible, sir.
[86:29.72]I always thought that Doc Holliday was the one that killed him.
[86:48.89]God damn it!
[86:53.36]You gotta keep the hand.
[86:54.74]You gotta keep the hand.
[86:58.74]It's fucking hard.
[87:04.17]Because they both move at different speeds.
[87:07.33]STOP TALKING!
[87:19.17]Oh!
[87:20.31]I'm gonna fucking lose again.
[87:21.27]Dude, this is fucking, this is really difficult.
[87:28.99]Shh.
[88:02.33]That didn't even happen at all.
[88:04.87]Let's rewind.
[88:05.73]No nuggets of truth.
[88:07.83]This is bad.
[88:08.13]I said I wanted this.
[88:08.87]Steady aim.
[88:09.37]Additional zoom while aiming.
[88:10.77]Got it.
[88:30.62]No nuggets at all either, yeah.
[88:32.22]It's too bad.
[88:37.44]That's incredible, sir!
[88:38.50]Now quite well, I'm trying to remember.
[88:40.86]Trying to remember how fun that was.
[88:50.58]Good perk?
[88:51.04]What do you mean?
[88:52.18]There's water in that bottle, Grandpa.
[88:53.64]You can stop pretending to be drunk.
[89:07.41]Wasn't he the sheriff who augmented his income by shaking down miners and robbing gold shipments?
[89:13.41]That's the one.
[89:14.80]Oh yeah, I remember him.
[89:16.80]He ran that gang of thieving outlaws called the Innocents.
[89:21.08]So it's true that you went toe to toe with him?
[89:24.04]Indeed I did, son.
[89:25.82]Indeed I did.
[89:28.70]Smoking inside.
[89:29.44]It's illegal now.
[89:43.55]Sounds like you're doing the voices.
[89:46.77]Maybe in another lifetime.
[89:49.59]I knew I needed resources if I was going to track down Roscoe Bob Bryant.
[89:54.44]And hunting plumber looked like a good way to get rich quick.
[89:59.62]As the local vigilantes exposed him as a leader of the bandits, and put a generous price on his head.
[90:07.98]This way.
[90:08.32]People are gonna be upset about it.
[90:10.14]I just... I got points for it.
[90:11.50]Uh, hold on.
[90:11.80]There's, like, secrets.
[90:13.14]How far can I go?
[90:47.99]You're leaving the story.
[90:49.39]Oh.
[90:57.42]I mean, look, okay.
[90:58.20]Red Dead was really fun.
[91:04.28]But I would love a current-gen Western shooter.
[91:18.32]They don't really exist anymore.
[91:25.80]Well, there's a... A nugget is somewhere nearby.
[91:28.53]Take secret.
[91:29.11]There's a bunch of shit in here, too.
[91:33.97]Cool.
[91:35.85]A lot of weapons.
[91:38.71]Shotgun.
[91:39.45]What's that called?
[91:40.15]Ranger.
[91:40.57]I don't think I... I don't... I shouldn't take any of these.
[91:46.21]Yeah, Red Dead is... That's explosive.
[91:50.47]Red Dead's great.
[91:52.97]But I like being able to actually aim one-to-one, shoot, and... You know, because Red Dead, in all... I mean, Rockstar makes great video games.
[92:01.42]But one thing that they don't really do that well is... Like, the combat portion.
[92:06.52]Because... When you just hold down left trigger, you just...
[92:15.76]And you just have to... It just auto-attaches to people.
[92:20.24]I know you can turn it off, but it's kind of detrimental to your experience.
[92:25.42]And they're like, yeah, well, what about PC?
[92:27.72]That game... Is that game ever going to even release on PC?
[92:29.92]Yeah, and you can just turn it off, but, like, the game...
[92:42.46]The game's a kind of nature.
[92:43.78]It's there, but it's not smooth.
[92:44.74]Yeah, it exists.
[92:45.46]It does exist.
[92:46.00]What is it?
[92:46.54]Who the fuck were you?
[93:18.92]The game is clearly intended for auto-aim, so without it, it's even worse.
[93:24.75]Yeah.
[93:26.05]To an extent.
[93:29.49]It is, like, hard to turn that off and aim with a controller.
[93:32.39]Especially with how some people's heads just kind of poke up and... It can be... It's not very smooth.
[93:38.95]Any secrets?
[93:42.67]I gotta go that way.
[93:43.37]What about over here?
[93:51.49]I don't think so.
[93:59.92]Secret?
[94:02.02]No.
[94:22.27]I mean this is the shitload of it, so why not just take a bunch and play with it?
[94:41.33]He's like, hey!
[94:41.88]Fuck you, don't do that.
[94:43.02]Anybody else?
[95:05.62]like those that ran with plumber so just regular folks I knew from town drawn by greed and easy pickings oh god james who worked in the stable sam and jeremiah barber the butcher's son these are people that you should follow he's giving you his list of like other streamer friends
[95:36.41]Oh fuck not good He set up a defensive perimeter which I had no idea how to breach I
[96:04.52]Panic for a second Was that rifle ammo
[96:43.68]I finally made it past and headed on to meet my destiny.
[96:49.37]Alright, so... Is that a person over there?
[96:53.11]No.
[96:55.87]But first, I had something I needed to figure out.
[96:59.66]Uh-oh.
[97:00.72]A puzzle.
[97:02.06]I had a few ideas on how to get into that mine.
[97:05.05]But once I made my decision, I knew there was no turning back.
[97:09.21]So my first thought was to enter the nearest mine portal.
[97:12.85]I saw an entrance.
[97:14.67]What the fuck?
[97:16.79]I feel like he's telling the story, but he has a big white horse.
[97:19.81]And he's drawing all this for them.
[97:22.01]And he erases it as he goes, actually, over this way.
[97:25.21]...the enemy pickets posted along the way.
[97:30.88]Alright, we got... What's in here?
[97:31.90]Ranger.
[97:40.55]Did dead guy say that?
[98:01.72]Should I get the shotgun?
[98:06.59]I'm gonna take a shotgun.
[98:10.81]And then, is there a secret in here somewhere?
[98:17.63]Who the fuck is shooting me?
[98:20.67]Okay.
[98:21.37]I didn't know there was a hole in the ceiling.
[98:40.31]Do I take the Ranger?
[98:41.27]Is the Ranger better than what I have?
[98:54.17]How do you tell which one's better?
[98:57.49]The Six Shooter has a star next to it.
[99:02.08]That means it's better, right?
[99:05.24]Just a powerful revolver.
[99:09.81]Yeah, I'll stick with what I got.
[99:10.57]Come on, no secret anywhere in here.
[99:20.28]Give me the experience.
[99:21.12]What the hell?
[99:21.68]Hello?
[99:21.88]Oh.
[99:41.72]They really want me to have that rifle, don't they?
[99:44.68]But, I'm not gonna take it.
[99:45.84]Deadly plunge, so I gotta be careful.
[99:51.37]They can't just like... E to climb.
[99:53.19]Wait.
[100:16.88]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[100:19.30]The fall damage is pretty severe.
[100:20.90]So are we gonna do something like Donkey Kong?
[100:25.55]A nugget is somewhere nearby.
[100:26.65]Well, where is it?
[100:38.73]A nugget is nearby.
[100:56.03]It's right there.
[101:00.80]Got it!
[101:05.74]Level up.
[101:08.56]Okay, do I keep going through here or do I do a different tree?
[101:12.11]I feel like I need to do a different tree.
[101:13.25]Okay, this is dual-wield revolvers.
[101:15.33]Grab two revolvers and give them hell.
[101:18.45]Press a wheel up or three to dual-wield.
[101:26.12]Yeah.
[101:29.05]I mean, I kind of have to do that.
[101:31.61]Can't play a game about cowboys and not dual-weld revolvers.
[101:36.55]Well, I'll just take two of these.
[101:37.79]Okay, so you just... Right mouse is still zoom.
[101:49.55]Alright, cool.
[101:53.25]Let me get down here.
[102:02.17]Quick reflexes often make up for a lack of common sense.
[102:05.63]Luckily, I was never one to be easily bushwacked.
[102:15.26]I pressed A, and it didn't.
[102:22.45]Oh, okay, so that wasn't a quick time event where you had to pr- I had to hold A. I thought I had to just press like A and move out of the way.
[102:32.70]I didn't know it was... I thought it was a quick time event.
[102:41.98]Nugget!
[102:45.17]But where?
[103:03.29]What the hell is this?
[103:06.39]What?
[103:06.51]No.
[103:06.57]No, come on.
[103:06.79]Alright, good.
[103:07.31]Looks like I'm just inside of this wall.
[103:08.87]Can I get up there?
[103:51.78]um maybe is it down here that's why would you do that here why would you do that here I thought we didn't even get to see the domino effect
[104:22.14]You were saying I... I'm saying... I'm saying I didn't even get to see like the brrrrrrr He's not gonna do shit.
[104:35.74]Maybe you are, I... It's gonna hit a barrel behind me.
[104:40.84]Why are you standing on them?
[104:44.12]You're just gonna kill us all.
[104:49.53]Where the fuck did he go?
[104:52.39]Okay.
[104:54.59]Did he blend in camouflage with the game?
[104:57.81]Did I not see him?
[104:59.53]How did I?
[105:00.65]I'm fucking blind.
[105:01.39]I have to be.
[105:09.60]Murderer.
[105:16.14]Eat shit.
[105:17.38]Okay.
[105:18.56]There it is.
[105:18.98]It's in here.
[105:26.47]Murderer!
[105:30.95]Okay, so now that I'm not out there, we can do it.
[105:56.30]So you gotta run.
[105:58.22]I get it.
[105:58.60]Could've been secret.
[106:10.97]Am I supposed to jump off?
[106:15.75]What the fuck?! !
[106:28.10]Wait, what happened?
[106:29.95]What did I do wrong?
[106:32.01]Oh, that's scripted.
[106:33.65]Scripted.
[106:34.45]Scripted.
[106:35.33]Scripted.
[106:39.73]That didn't happen.
[106:42.30]Grandpa's been, like, drinking fucking NyQuil again.
[106:45.90]I was gonna say, there's no way.
[106:52.54]It was a long way around, but that approach seemed more sensible at the time.
[106:57.95]Of course, being I had a problem with heights, that scaffolding scared the bejesus out of me.
[107:04.71]Climbing down that ladder required some caution.
[107:08.41]Was he aware of the younger man's reflexes?
[107:13.88]No man can dodge a damn bullet while climbing down a rickety ladder.
[107:22.14]I needed to make a leap of faith.
[107:29.99]I can't tell what's scripted and what's not scripted.
[107:34.01]I just hit my face on that board.
[107:37.31]My entire front row of teeth are gone.
[107:39.11]Implying this guy had any front teeth.
[108:09.16]When am I going to change the FOV?
[108:10.56]I tried to do it before and it didn't work.
[108:13.51]So when I take my pee break here after this level, I'm going to try to do it again.
[108:27.42]A choice.
[108:28.60]Is this an elevator?
[108:29.08]Nugget!
[108:29.30]The elevator's boring.
[108:58.06]No, elevator's boring.
[109:00.30]I'm climbing the ladder.
[109:00.90]Do I have to race this thing?
[109:12.80]There's the, uh... I told you this is a good idea.
[109:14.82]Do I have to beat this?
[109:21.87]How is a ladder less boring?
[109:23.53]Because, I don't know, at least I don't have to... Who's shooting me?
[109:31.16]Do you see anybody here?
[109:34.16]Oh, they're already up there.
[109:35.48]They took the elevator.
[109:36.54]Okay.
[109:57.04]I just fucked up my accuracy for the whole level.
[109:59.08]God damn it.
[109:59.58]But I had to do that.
[110:06.20]Alright, we'll take the elevator back down.
[110:10.84]That wasn't even a cool choice.
[110:12.02]It was just walk or don't walk.
[110:14.27]First wheel, okay.
[110:19.03]Uh-oh.
[110:20.89]I don't care about accuracy anymore.
[110:37.85]I don't have my rifle Oh, Nevada?
[110:47.46]Oh, Nevada?
[110:50.52]I've been there before Okay, so find Henry Plummer Is that him?
[111:14.35]Can I jump over this?
[111:16.93]I guess.
[111:19.21]There might be a secret down here.
[111:26.16]No.
[111:26.90]Oh shit.
[111:34.22]So there's Mr. Plumber.
[111:38.10]He's dynamite enthusiast.
[111:46.96]I got four to four.
[111:54.79]Oh, okay.
[112:06.76]What?
[112:06.96]Did somebody stab me?
[112:08.42]Did I step on a fucking bear trap?
[112:38.55]What the fuck?!
[112:49.46]No, don't kill me, please!
[113:07.58]It's gonna get him!
[113:09.16]Where's the dynamite?
[113:11.28]I threw dynamite!
[113:12.90]Nice!
[113:33.41]I can't see!
[113:34.21]Oh, no!
[113:34.83]Okay, don't... I need that rifle.
[113:37.95]I don't have the rifle.
[113:43.53]I need that rifle.
[113:45.45]No dual welding.
[113:48.17]And no, like, fucking comedy throws.
[113:51.45]Where is he?
[113:57.84]Oh, shit, no.
[113:58.52]Okay, I'm starting at the second phase.
[114:11.87]He's back?
[114:15.84]Shit, there he is.
[114:30.19]Fuck!
[114:32.39]Oh my god, he's throwing my... Jesus Christ!
[114:36.51]What?
[114:52.98]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[114:56.64]Ow.
[115:03.35]I'm trying to shoot them.
[115:04.57]I'm trying to shoot them.
[115:09.91]Where's the, is this another person shooting me?
[115:35.87]No!
[115:36.61]No!
[115:37.43]Which way is he going?
[115:38.99]Oh god!
[115:45.35]Oh god!
[115:46.23]Oh my god, what's doing that?
[115:48.05]Holy shit!
[115:49.88]Is he throwing three at a time?
[115:53.84]Who the fuck is shooting me?
[115:56.98]I swear to god, it's this guy.
[115:59.18]Jesus!
[116:02.88]Oh, this is it.
[116:15.77]I didn't hit him, fuck!
[116:23.04]Why do I have this shotgun?
[116:29.48]If I had my rifle, this would be... Can I get you?
[116:33.08]Oh, you're too far away!
[116:35.74]Why do I even have this thing?
[116:51.45]I said no to the rifle and took the shotgun.
[116:53.61]I'm only gonna use the rifle and the pistol.
[116:56.07]I have one gun right now.
[117:12.37]Look at this shit.
[117:21.82]All right, don't let him collapse on me.
[117:28.00]Where is he?
[117:30.75]Where's the other guy?
[117:37.85]There he is.
[117:42.20]Oh fuck!
[117:43.22]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[117:50.75]Where the fuck did he go?
[118:21.75]Oh shit.
[118:24.05]This is supposed to be a chill stream.
[118:33.18]No, it still is.
[118:33.64]Told you I fucked up the accuracy bad.
[118:49.62]Alright, one level.
[118:50.36]There we go.
[118:50.84]We can go up here.
[118:51.56]Revolver ammo capacity increased.
[118:56.80]100% more ammo.
[119:00.78]Don't stop your killing frenzy so soon.
[119:02.64]Your combo meter will stay active for longer.
[119:05.45]Better chaining and longer combos earn more experience.
[119:10.01]Yeah.
[119:13.63]Hydrate, hydrate.
[119:14.43]I'm alright.
[119:15.05]I'm good.
[119:16.11]I've had a drink writer.
[119:20.18]In before everybody says coffee doesn't count.
[119:22.36]Okay.
[119:24.72]But you suck at combos.
[119:28.98]Don't ever say that again.
[119:31.48]Alright.
[119:32.92]I'm going to go grab another water.
[119:35.10]Even though there was never a water here.
[119:36.68]It was coffee.
[119:37.20]I'm going to grab a coffee and a water.
[119:40.98]I'm going to try to fix the FOV thing again.
[119:44.10]So we'll do our first little pee break.
[119:46.18]So I'm going to try to go very fast so I can sprint back up here to be able to, um, to fix, to try to get this done.
[119:56.07]I'm going to, like, flatfoot run.
[120:01.30]Well, I heard word he was in Kansas with John Wesley Hardin.
[120:05.90]So that's where I went.
[120:08.66]we're in kansas this game's really fun though I like it a lot no reason was harden as fast as ringo ringo was fast but john wesley was as fast as the devil himself
[120:27.57]Yeah, I want my heel, my bottom, and my toes to hit the ground at the same time.
[120:33.28]So it's like... So, like, you know, I'll give you an example, like... But times 50.
[121:00.62]Alright, I'm gonna get here.
[121:01.36]I'm gonna exit the game.
[121:02.98]I'll be right back.
[121:03.78]Hold on one second here.
[121:05.70]Alright, I'll be right back.
[121:07.24]Get some water.
[121:07.86]And I'm gonna run as fast as I can back here.
[121:34.45]Exit game.
[121:34.93]All right.
[121:35.93]I'm going to try this one more time.
[121:38.45]Somebody was linking stuff.
[121:42.61]What were you linking?
[121:52.10]There were people that said there was the... There it is.
[121:57.58]Okay.
[122:04.34]Go to the configuration file.
[122:07.98]Would you look at that?
[122:11.14]I might be able to do this for a second before I leave.
[122:28.72]Local data.
[122:29.94]How come I can't get into this folder now?
[122:43.67]It's percent, local data percent, right?
[122:46.95]What did I do?
[122:52.25]What the fuck did I do?
[122:55.55]Local app data, right?
[122:56.41]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[123:02.55]Okay.
[123:04.33]Go get yourself something to drink.
[123:06.91]I'll be right back.
[123:07.95]See you in... I'm just gonna sprint.
[123:09.63]See you in a minute.
[125:25.91]So a quick question.
[125:28.93]I'm still here.
[125:29.77]I'm just getting this done.
[125:31.21]So this video file, when I opened it again, the changes I made were gone.
[125:37.87]Okay?
[125:41.26]So the things that I put in on opening after closing the game are gone.
[125:47.90]Should I make this read only?
[125:49.50]And we'll, yeah, I'm gonna have to make the video file, this file here actually read only, right?
[125:57.74]Okay.
[125:59.34]Alright, cool.
[126:02.10]Did you know?
[126:02.46]No, I saved it.
[126:03.10]I saved it, like, three times.
[126:04.78]Just make sure it's... Now, this should work.
[126:08.32]I did everything I should.
[126:10.83]Post the fight to Twitter.
[126:11.99]I will once the Pikachu sock's coming.
[126:15.93]Next week or something.
[126:18.49]Alright, let me just make sure it's read-only.
[126:20.65]It is... FOV 90, disable screen border, render viewpoint.
[126:34.41]So that's all activated now.
[126:39.45]Should be all saved.
[126:40.31]All right.
[126:49.10]Now I'm actually going to go pee.
[126:50.56]So I'll be right back.
[129:42.62]All right, let's try this again.
[129:57.52]Let's open that.
[130:01.82]Okay.
[130:02.16]Alright, cross your fingers.
[130:04.42]Let's hope this works.
[130:06.22]It's gonna be a little loud too.
[130:07.55]I can't really change it because there's no windowed full screen in this game.
[130:12.41]So, loud incoming.
[130:13.83]Prepare your ears.
[130:14.93]Alright, come on.
[130:24.79]Take off the FOV.
[130:25.69]Take off the border.
[130:36.16]Damn it.
[130:41.36]Why?
[130:41.72]Come on.
[130:55.13]This is just here, right?
[130:56.79]It's just in the first menu?
[131:00.37]I made it read-only.
[131:01.23]I added the three things to the bottom.
[131:03.15]I saved it.
[131:08.78]Come on.
[131:17.62]Do it.
[131:20.20]Yes!
[131:20.56]Oh, I feel like I can breathe.
[131:22.78]I'm dead.
[131:23.33]Alright, I was...
[131:39.72]Wine in a can?
[131:40.60]No, it's a pineapple juice.
[131:49.59]Oh, we went the other way this time.
[132:02.76]Didn't hit him?
[132:03.48]Come on.
[132:04.28]Do I have another gun?
[132:04.78]Oh, I have a rifle.
[132:15.70]Come on.
[132:16.50]None of those hit anybody.
[132:18.26]You gotta be shitting me.
[132:20.78]Do it.
[132:21.80]Yeah.
[132:34.91]That's what they want you to believe.
[132:50.51]I'm not gonna take it.
[132:51.71]Why ever take anything besides these two guns?
[132:53.93]You know what I'm saying?
[132:54.59]These are the only two guns you should have.
[132:57.69]Nugget?
[132:57.87]On the wall?
[132:58.22]No.
[132:58.62]Only a hundred bucks!
[133:24.22]Oh God, this is gonna be another one.
[133:26.65]Wait, I'm jumping the gun here.
[133:29.13]Let me back up and give you some background on this son of a bitch.
[133:33.45]He deserves that.
[133:34.37]Big bets.
[133:35.71]Don't you think so, Ben?
[133:38.78]John Wesley Harden was a killer.
[133:41.12]Fine Harden.
[133:42.58]By the end, he confessed to taking the lives of 42 men.
[133:46.70]Fathers and husbands.
[133:48.53]Brothers and sons.
[133:50.29]Men with families who cared about them.
[133:52.97]He was a bonafide folk hero by then, and had amassed a gang of armed miscreants and other assorted thugs.
[133:59.02]I didn't get the... I'm annoyed that I didn't get the secret.
[134:00.86]He and his men set up camp outside of town, and I was hoping Bob was among them.
[134:06.14]Shit, it's cold out here.
[134:07.36]All right, let's see if I... Let me get, like, a times five.
[134:09.89]Ain't right we gotta stay out here keeping watch like this.
[134:12.83]Ain't no mercy.
[134:13.75]Damn it!
[134:17.76]Dammit.
[134:18.04]Anybody else?
[134:18.54]That was a Collat.
[134:21.07]Alright, what's in here?
[134:23.61]Nugget.
[134:41.04]They keep trying to give me what's... I don't want that stuff.
[134:46.02]I definitely want that.
[134:47.48]Alright, that's my close range.
[134:56.40]This is my long range.
[135:05.71]German, can you pretend this is $50?
[135:06.87]Thanks, man.
[135:09.66]Pretend this game is $50?
[135:12.48]I think this game's like six bucks.
[135:15.12]Why would I pretend it's more money?
[135:17.48]Hello?
[135:17.82]Where?
[135:22.16]I don't think this is supposed to be up here.
[135:44.93]Jerma, come on.
[135:45.77]Wait, what?
[135:50.53]Bits?
[135:51.15]Was it?
[135:51.51]Oh, bit.
[135:51.94]Hold.
[135:52.68]My stream labs is not even updated.
[135:54.60]Hold on.
[136:00.14]Hold on a second.
[136:08.34]Oh, gee.
[136:08.92]AM Scoots gave 50 bucks.
[136:11.04]No, that was yesterday.
[136:16.13]Okay, hold on.
[136:18.09]All right.
[136:18.43]All right.
[136:18.71]All right.
[136:19.11]All right.
[136:20.35]I get it.
[136:20.93]I understand now.
[136:24.80]Do you get it?
[136:27.92]I get it.
[136:28.52]There's not the game.
[136:29.90]The bits.
[136:30.89]Pretend the bits.
[136:31.69]Can you pretend this is 50 bucks?
[136:34.01]I was saying, what the fuck are you talking about?
[136:52.11]That's double-digit IQ.
[136:54.17]No, it's called... I'm paying attention to the game, and I look over and I see, pretend this is 50 bucks.
[137:03.78]I got a triple-digit IQ.
[137:05.52]I already told you what it was.
[137:06.46]126.
[137:08.92]With a few deductions.
[137:09.70]Ooh.
[137:25.77]It was 126 and I got 18 points deducted because I ripped the page in half.
[137:35.73]And said, you can't.
[137:36.55]I'm not doing it.
[137:38.91]And then it was minus 10 points because I fell asleep during the test.
[137:43.85]And then I got plus 8 points
[137:57.45]Because I got one question right that nobody else did.
[138:00.37]So they were like, Jesus, we've got to give them extra points here.
[138:06.29]What was Abraham Lincoln's wife's name?
[138:10.30]I don't know why.
[138:10.84]I'm the only person, I guess, in the country that knew what that was.
[138:19.84]Before I could test my mettle against Harden, however...
[138:24.13]Minus 10 points for trying to stream the test.
[138:25.83]Why are none of these hitting?
[138:52.51]Okay, I was in Q mode.
[138:54.13]That's absolute bullshit.
[138:57.24]It's not bad aim.
[138:59.48]It's not bad aim.
[139:00.14]Like, game is not even... It's like fucking a bug in the game.
[139:03.04]It's like a game bug problem, you know?
[139:06.84]It's not my problem.
[139:08.10]It's a game code bug fucking issue.
[139:19.74]Like, what's with that code?
[139:21.58]Watch this code.
[139:23.00]Unbelievable.
[139:29.49]Like, bracket stop.
[139:30.83]Bracket close.
[139:33.25]See line one.
[139:34.59]Like, fuck you.
[139:35.50]You know what I mean?
[139:36.40]Watch this.
[139:38.72]What was that?
[139:56.19]Oh yeah, like bracket if stop bracket close hyphen semicolon then entity A bracket close stop new bracket Thank God that was a code that worked.
[140:16.78]Okay, I'm gonna stop fucking around.
[140:31.63]Does Jerma know that IQ tests aren't written tests?
[140:36.83]Um, there's some written portions.
[140:39.99]You gotta remember numbers, sequences, you have to... You have to, like, move blocks around and create pictures with blocks.
[140:49.16]I did one.
[140:49.78]They take like six hours.
[140:51.44]I've done it twice.
[140:54.28]Guys, an IQ test is not as simple as going to, like, IQtest.com and it takes 30 minutes.
[140:58.39]No, no, no.
[140:58.85]It takes, like, fucking all day.
[141:01.19]My god.
[141:02.71]Like, just enlightened on another level I am.
[141:07.69]See?
[141:07.91]Let's see.
[141:19.77]What have we got?
[141:23.44]You did it twice so you can add the numbers together.
[141:27.18]That's not how it works.
[141:29.68]Let's see.
[141:31.59]Fast revolver reload.
[141:36.91]Let me look at the other one.
[141:39.99]Fast aiming.
[141:42.47]Throw, shoot the dynamite.
[141:43.84]Create a nice fireworks display and do some damage as well.
[141:46.86]After you throw a stick of dynamite, you can easily shoot it from the hip as the crosshair of your gun will get sticky to it.
[141:53.67]Huh, that's cool.
[141:55.97]Dual-weld IQ tests.
[141:58.19]Just hold them up in the air.
[142:00.91]Look at how much smarter I am than you.
[142:11.34]What's this one?
[142:11.84]Headhunter.
[142:12.48]More concentration for headshots.
[142:18.25]Make some headshots to increase your focus.
[142:21.75]Oh, yeah, I want that.
[142:23.78]I want this next.
[142:38.09]You say you have high IQ, but you're a streamer.
[142:44.78]What does...
[142:48.87]I don't know.
[142:49.23]Okay.
[142:50.02]Is it like a sample size of streamers that are just like dopes or something?
[142:53.86]I don't understand what that means.
[143:00.74]How many channels are live right now?
[143:09.05]Hey, it's real easy to take like the high ground.
[143:11.25]I'm so smart.
[143:13.15]I'm so smart.
[143:13.77]I'm smarter than the streamer.
[143:15.93]Are you though?
[143:18.09]Are you?
[143:19.25]Tell me.
[143:21.24]How do you calculate that?
[143:22.22]How do you know that?
[143:32.48]Well, I know this because you didn't get a headshot on that guy behind you.
[143:36.85]And you died there.
[143:37.65]That's why I'm so much smarter than you.
[144:09.86]What?
[144:10.04]I don't know what direction.
[144:12.04]I couldn't see through the chain link fence.
[144:15.98]Didn't you know that reaction times and hand-eye coordination is intelligence?
[144:26.29]What are you talking about?
[144:46.06]Dude, I... Dude, it's like they're throwing fucking ketchup in my eyes!
[144:57.77]I can't even see, they're like squeezing blood in my face!
[145:07.25]Goddamn!
[145:24.62]No, I can't see shit!
[145:29.82]If you get shot, all of a sudden the whole world goes blank and there's ten people in a circle around you.
[145:44.16]What?
[146:12.82]This shit, that shit's just not gonna happen.
[146:14.46]Like, everything is made out of these fucking whole fences.
[146:30.77]I was disappointed that neither Bob nor John Wesley were among the dead.
[146:35.75]If you're so smart, what's a hundred times two?
[146:38.55]As a moment later, I was facing down the fastest gun in the West.
[146:42.31]I have no idea.
[146:43.80]It's... One times two, then you carry the two zeros.
[146:49.12]I don't know.
[146:49.48]I'm gonna fucking close it.
[146:53.00]Math does not equal intelligence.
[146:55.75]How good you are with numbers and math is not intelligence.
[146:58.81]It's being able to add things and subtract things together and times them and shit.
[147:01.89]Was he just standing there?
[147:03.03]This is freaking me out.
[147:04.81]Why is he just sitting there like this?
[147:07.56]Am I fighting a cardboard cutout or is the guy behind me?
[147:27.93]Oh god, this is like a fucking wet sock.
[147:58.55]Why would you put that in- I don't- Agh!
[148:26.56]No shit!
[148:27.30]I didn't want to do that!
[148:28.94]I clicked it accidentally!
[148:30.08]I actually clicked it accidentally.
[148:40.63]Oh my god.
[148:55.41]I feel like I'm tied up right now.
[149:13.24]What?
[149:13.73]I dodged?
[149:14.29]I'm dod-
[149:40.01]This is the one As he was he didn't count his shots and now he was at my mercy I
[150:00.13]Did I get him?
[150:00.77]Does that... It's scripted.
[150:02.09]I can't kill him.
[150:03.18]That was supposed to happen.
[150:04.88]No skills.
[150:31.77]intelligence I get news for you everyone's dumb some say revenge is a dish best served cold so whatever happened to that bob guy you were after personally I'd like to hear some of your other adventures like uh I don't know do you ever go toe to toe with a red man there's only been like eight smart people to ever live
[151:01.50]They call it the Enlightened Eight.
[151:03.74]Who are they?
[151:04.28]Uh...
[151:41.16]I said, look, look.
[151:42.64]I'm reading the story.
[151:43.64]Ben Franklin.
[151:43.90]Ben Franklin.
[151:44.42]Stephen Hawking.
[151:54.35]Gray Wolf was a Chiricahua Apache medicine man who had led a war party in revenge for a massacre against his people.
[152:01.25]Albert Einstein.
[152:01.95]The U.S.
[152:02.31]Army had attacked his tribe during his daughter's secret sunrise ceremony.
[152:06.65]The Heinz ketchup lady.
[152:07.65]The slaughter was unspeakable.
[152:09.97]I understood his anger, as there's nothing more traumatic than seeing those guys die a cruel and painful death.
[152:27.28]Not John Maytag.
[152:30.30]All right, so you got... That's four.
[152:44.85]That's enough.
[152:45.27]I don't know.
[152:49.71]Dr. Dre?
[152:50.37]Uh...
[152:57.92]Um... Dr. Okur?
[153:05.90]Two doctors on that list.
[153:12.34]Dr. Pepper?
[153:15.45]They all gotta be doctors.
[153:19.93]Oh fuck, I'm going the wrong way.
[153:32.44]Doctor Doom?
[153:33.36]Yeah, there's gonna be a fictional doctor on that list.
[153:35.59]That's true.
[153:43.39]Doctor Octopus?
[153:44.35]No.
[153:46.99]Doctor House?
[153:49.33]That's like 11.
[153:50.25]That's enough, I think.
[153:55.34]Are you implying that Dr. Pepper isn't real?
[153:57.24]Dr. Pepper is 78 ingredients.
[153:58.42]78 different people.
[154:03.38]Guys, Dr. Pepper is like Satoshi Nakamoto.
[154:07.96]It's like 30 people that made one product, one beverage.
[154:11.82]It's like Shakespeare.
[154:12.88]That's a myth.
[154:33.65]I don't know.
[154:34.15]You don't know.
[154:37.73]Do you know?
[154:38.21]You don't know?
[154:39.95]Stop.
[154:52.56]Stop.
[154:52.96]I'm just playing.
[154:56.48]Stop it.
[155:11.22]Did you just say that turkeys were endangered?
[155:13.00]What was that guy doing?
[155:15.81]What?
[155:15.91]Ooh.
[155:37.27]Hey!
[155:38.77]What line of sight do you have?
[155:41.25]Oh, I see.
[155:42.75]The bullshit one.
[155:50.03]Oh, he was busy.
[155:50.55]He was inventing the wa- Alright, I'm not gonna be one of those people that just gets like really mad at like at the fact that I didn't get any hit registration there.
[156:15.92]Where?
[156:16.32]Ah!
[156:16.96]Alright.
[156:18.80]Ah!
[156:19.04]I don't have to say anything.
[156:30.51]All I have to go is... Ah!
[156:38.64]I already have that.
[156:39.84]Where's he going?
[156:40.97]Where is he?
[157:13.87]Who's left?
[157:14.49]Is that it?
[157:18.66]I think that's it.
[157:20.90]I need more gamer fuel.
[157:28.14]Alright!
[157:33.44]It didn't work!
[157:34.08]It didn't work!
[157:34.66]It didn't work!
[157:35.34]It's supposed to work!
[157:38.88]Come on!
[157:39.60]What?
[157:40.05]No!
[157:41.70]What, you're telling me that drinking powdered sugar and powdered vitamins like B2 and B12 is not gonna give me superpowers?
[157:49.45]With like orange creamsicle flavoring?
[157:52.21]What?
[157:52.85]No!
[157:53.47]Okay, hold on.
[158:14.09]By the way, you guys mean to tell me that glorified Kool-Aid is not gonna make me a better gamer?
[158:19.69]What?
[158:37.63]You need those acai berries.
[158:42.21]Holy shit, that scared me.
[158:43.60]How do you feel about brain fluid?
[158:45.62]I mean, it hurts if you drink it, but... I think that's because it's too acidic.
[159:28.20]Why does he know that?
[159:32.98]Okay, that scared the shi- I thought the rock was fucking alive!
[159:36.63]It was weird, it was like glitching out and fucking coming at me.
[159:58.52]Search the caves.
[160:01.34]We got ourselves a search mission.
[160:09.41]Alright, I want to get times like five here.
[160:11.25]Ready?
[160:11.51]One, two, three.
[160:17.44]There it is.
[160:17.76]Times four.
[160:23.76]It didn't happen this time.
[160:26.85]High IQ streamer scared by beehive!
[160:29.58]That's what I thought that was for a second.
[160:33.16]Really?
[160:58.68]I thought they were going to come forward.
[161:06.15]Damn.
[161:22.11]I hope they get you.
[161:27.51]Come on.
[161:28.23]Really?
[161:29.94]Be nicer to me.
[161:37.70]Ooh, secret!
[161:41.58]Uh, no level up though.
[161:43.72]It's pissing me off.
[161:46.83]No level up?
[161:47.37]It's like really fucking pissing me off now.
[161:59.24]That wasn't a headshot.
[162:01.39]It's like fucking pissing me off now.
[162:09.48]Play Red Steel 2.
[162:10.28]I know you have a Wii, you casual fuck.
[162:12.12]That's like pissing me off.
[162:14.52]Relax, man.
[162:15.14]Like, that's fucking pissing me off.
[162:30.25]Just code happiness into the game.
[162:33.03]Happiness is pissing me off.
[162:34.11]Don't fucking be happy right now.
[162:34.99]I don't want... I don't... I... That's... I don't know.
[162:36.11]Whatever.
[162:36.59]Let's just go.
[162:36.97]You're pissing me off.
[162:37.64]Smiler?
[162:37.78]What?
[163:02.66]No, I got such a good hit rating going right now.
[163:04.50]Don't fuck it up because you pressed the wrong button.
[163:14.53]Keep the streak.
[163:16.81]It's all about the streak right now.
[163:17.81]Come on.
[163:18.01]Five.
[163:23.08]Six?
[163:24.50]Oh, that's all that's here.
[163:26.74]Okay.
[163:57.71]Secret.
[164:00.29]Now I gotta level up.
[164:01.04]Okay.
[164:07.78]Streamer, you're grinding my gears.
[164:11.81]It's okay.
[164:15.59]Oh, this is... I wanted Headhunter, right?
[164:16.91]Yeah.
[164:19.77]None can hide.
[164:20.53]Hints about enemies behind you.
[164:21.89]Spot enemies even beyond your field of view during concentration.
[164:26.27]Markers on the edge of the screen will point at every enemy nearby.
[164:29.93]Every nearby enemy that you would not normally see.
[164:31.55]And then we get the golden rifle.
[164:34.33]I want that.
[164:34.71]We're going to go fast.
[164:36.81]Full fast tech tree and golden rifle.
[164:45.34]Can you get a talent to make it so that you can actually aim?
[164:50.97]I mean, is that supposed to be funny?
[164:52.45]Was that supposed to be a funny joke?
[164:55.23]I didn't think it was very funny.
[164:56.09]Now this pisses me off.
[165:23.47]What's going on?
[165:25.32]Has his story unfolded in my mind?
[165:28.92]You will come to this place again and kill many more men and the darkness will grow until it consumes everything.
[165:35.76]That's a good way to get to like plus 10 or 20.
[165:38.36]I had no tears.
[165:44.07]He said I was a great warrior.
[165:46.69]A coyote man.
[165:48.51]Unequaled by any other pale-faced warrior.
[165:51.07]SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT
[166:31.71]Alright, you just, you broke my concentration.
[166:35.61]Anybody else?
[166:38.01]Is that it?
[166:42.12]Did I shoot him in the eyelash?
[166:46.40]I didn't see any way out of this trap.
[166:49.04]But suddenly one just appeared.
[166:51.16]Kind of like a miracle.
[166:58.26]Well, I gotta level up.
[167:00.60]Right here.
[167:03.36]Yeah, this is good.
[167:04.22]Okay, then we get Executioner.
[167:08.47]So, I can spot enemies even beyond my field of view.
[167:13.97]It'll show me where people are.
[167:16.63]Oh, wow!
[167:17.31]Cheating game is now easy.
[167:18.39]There's nobody here.
[167:25.22]Oh, no, never mind.
[167:36.20]I'll take the ammo, though.
[167:39.26]Jerma, are you joking?
[167:41.98]I mean, I saw the, like... Okay, I... Look, I just pressed the level up button, and all of a sudden... I saw, like, two or three stars pop up.
[167:50.75]He never jokes.
[167:51.33]Very serious streamer.
[168:07.48]I hit- I pressed the button!
[168:08.64]What was wrong with that?
[168:10.56]Okay, here.
[168:10.86]Oh.
[168:27.94]Chase.
[168:28.30]I chased after him, determined to make him explain the meaning of all that mumbo jumbo.
[168:34.44]Mumbo jumbo is right.
[168:36.64]Are you making this all up as you go?
[168:39.06]A few details may be fuzzy, brother, but I am relating exactly.
[168:43.36]He can't reach it.
[168:44.84]He can't reach it.
[168:45.76]There were dozens of Apache warriors aiming at me from on high.
[168:49.70]Dozens.
[168:51.46]Well, maybe not dozens.
[168:52.48]I hit every single one of those shots.
[168:56.97]What?
[168:57.91]Wait!
[169:10.34]Where the hell were you?
[169:15.86]What?
[169:19.20]It's really fucking pissing me off.
[169:22.66]It's pissing me off.
[169:27.43]Is that the one thing I'm gonna repeat a hundred times today?
[169:29.81]Probably.
[169:30.21]Dude, where the fuck are you?
[169:46.90]Where is this magic person?
[169:59.25]I had a steep climb up creek ahead of me and scrambled up those rocks like a mountain goat.
[170:04.27]I was determined to locate Grey Wolf and find out exactly what the hell he was trying to tell me.
[170:09.84]And wouldn't you know- Boss fight.
[170:10.86]That crafty son of a bitch- I- okay, I just put my head- I scratched my fucking face.
[170:16.50]Well, son, there had to be at least a hundred of passengers around.
[170:20.08]This is sometimes why I want to face Kim.
[170:23.28]So you guys can see my proof.
[170:24.02]I don't know where he is.
[170:25.16]I don't know where I... I don't...
[171:11.35]Where are you?
[171:12.95]What the fuck is you?
[171:19.13]Jesus.
[171:19.89]Okay.
[172:06.85]Come on!
[172:07.35]I'm getting deja vu.
[172:15.75]Is he getting deja vu?
[172:16.71]You have to, yeah, don't you have to like break the cycle?
[172:19.71]So go, like go pee or something.
[172:39.52]Go pee and shake your face a little bit and put some water in your face and you'll wake up in the real world.
[172:45.53]Was I supposed to do something there?
[172:57.36]Was I supposed to... I don't... I think I was supposed to do something there.
[173:05.98]No, throw some water in your face.
[173:09.98]Thank you, darling.
[173:11.52]It's interesting how the truth can sometimes seem malleable, depending upon your point of view.
[173:19.06]Like how those dime novels make you out to be something you're not?
[173:23.29]Jack, don't be starting trouble.
[173:26.19]No, he's right.
[173:27.03]They do tend to exaggerate.
[173:30.45]Did they exaggerate your part in taking down the Dolphins?
[173:34.43]Well, I was there in the flesh, boy, so I saw what happened firsthand.
[173:42.03]Have you ever played a first-person shooter before?
[173:43.67]I'm doing just fine.
[173:47.49]63%?
[173:47.51]You sound like all those headshots.
[173:48.71]What are you talking about?
[173:49.43]Why are some of you guys acting like I'm from the 1800s and this is the first time I've ever seen a movie?
[174:22.04]You should play Bulletstorm.
[174:24.48]Yeah, Bulletstorm looks really fun.
[174:25.66]I played it for a little while.
[174:27.12]Not very long.
[174:27.84]Oh.
[174:27.90]Two banks at the same time?
[174:29.34]Bulletstorm is a great... It'll be a great stream.
[174:50.87]Yeah, I like these cool, stylish shooters.
[174:59.55]What is this I see in front of me?
[175:02.92]Magic?
[175:04.98]I don't think I'm very comfortable here, seeing as the magic that's playing out in front of me.
[175:09.52]I've never been here before.
[175:10.54]I've never seen such a thing before.
[175:11.94]Witchcraft, I say!
[175:12.98]A moving picture?
[175:23.39]That one can control.
[175:24.39]No, no, no, no, I've never heard of such a thing.
[175:30.36]Burn it.
[175:37.18]The brothers paid dearly for their stupidity, but everybody knows they had it coming.
[175:43.94]There's more to it than that.
[175:45.76]I read all about that day, so I know for a fact that it went down very differently.
[175:52.54]First of all, it was high noon.
[175:54.86]A posse of U.S.
[175:55.97]deputy marshals were on the rooftop.
[175:57.99]U.S.
[175:58.39]deputy marshals.
[175:59.75]True thing.
[176:02.93]Get ready.
[176:04.33]Leveled up the horn.
[176:06.35]Now they finally had him dead to rights.
[176:08.77]Among them was a bounty hunter feared by many a lawbreaker.
[176:14.36]The marshals tried to get the Daltons to surrender.
[176:20.91]Come on, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo!
[176:22.09]Come on, somebody else come out!
[176:23.67]Please!
[176:23.87]Nooo!
[176:24.07]Sorry!
[176:24.27]Back of the bank!
[176:47.48]From behind.
[176:47.86]Behind the bank.
[176:48.24]But, there might be a secret.
[176:49.18]No, no, no, really?
[176:49.77]Come on, there's no secret here.
[176:51.85]Oh well.
[177:18.12]Bulletstorm is the most generic shooter ever created.
[177:20.74]Jesus.
[177:50.31]Alright, I made it.
[178:01.88]More, more.
[178:02.32]You know, a speedrun of this game would be really cool.
[178:05.75]Just sprinting through and just racking up like times 20 or something.
[178:10.37]Oh.
[178:12.33]I feel like I don't want any of these.
[178:15.41]I don't.
[178:22.72]I don't think I want any more.
[178:30.24]Oh, he... What?
[178:47.18]That's not how you load those pistols.
[178:49.36]Nugget!
[178:51.32]In the... in here?
[178:53.14]Yep.
[178:55.96]I have a level up.
[178:56.40]I'll do it afterwards.
[178:57.00]Okay.
[178:59.54]What?
[179:00.65]Ah!
[179:00.79]Huh?
[179:20.52]Anymore?
[179:20.86]That's it?
[179:21.08]Keep telling the same story.
[179:22.98]This game... this is... this game is so dumb, I love it.
[179:26.08]No, that's not how it happened.
[179:50.87]Let me tell you what did happen.
[179:52.45]Go back.
[179:54.23]It was Halloween and I was doing the fucked up shit that I usually do.
[180:08.50]Smashing pumpkins.
[180:10.68]What?
[180:20.17]The leader, the lover, the loser.
[180:22.01]Bob, Emmett, and Grat.
[180:23.45]Uh, I went even out of the cutscene and I took a hit.
[180:26.53]The Shielder.
[180:26.89]Uh, well, his name was Shielder!
[180:49.06]He was the shielder!
[180:51.38]What?
[180:52.02]I thought he had a health bar!
[181:07.48]Now I know what the hell is going on.
[181:18.74]Don't let him get away.
[181:33.13]Just run around and just backstab him.
[181:42.62]Those friends came after me like a pack of wild dogs, tooth and nail.
[181:48.61]They were coming at me from all directions.
[181:50.68]Come on, come on, come on.
[181:52.06]What?
[181:52.84]I caught sight of the Daltons running with the money.
[181:55.26]Didn't want to lose them.
[181:56.58]Problem was, they knew the town better than I did.
[181:59.72]And to top it all, I found myself in the middle of another shootout and tired.
[182:05.49]Where are you?
[182:06.35]No, it was the Smiths.
[182:09.17]Where are you?
[182:10.25]They were cousins of the Daltons.
[182:12.27]And they were shooting at the Browns, who were shooting at the Daltons.
[182:15.95]Which wasn't any surprise, because those two families have been feuding forever.
[182:21.06]Dispatch the Dalton brothers' allies.
[182:23.30]In here.
[182:23.46]Secret up here, probably.
[182:24.72]Oh, you better believe it.
[182:26.06]It's in here, right?
[182:26.64]Come on.
[182:27.18]Where is it?
[182:27.74]I keep touching it.
[182:28.36]Secret?
[182:51.29]God damn it!
[182:51.88]Where is it?
[182:55.06]In here?
[183:03.54]Where the fuck is this thing?
[183:05.09]He's downstairs?
[183:23.59]Oh, it's right here.
[183:25.57]Got him.
[183:30.61]My God!
[183:32.69]What the fuck?
[183:38.86]Where is this guy?
[183:39.70]All right, my goodness.
[183:47.30]Up here.
[183:48.20]The Dalton boys knew I would never give up.
[183:53.00]Is that gonna hit me?
[183:53.82]Um... I can go underneath?
[183:54.86]Wait, why did this turn into Donkey Kong?
[183:57.02]I did it.
[184:23.72]You can get up there.
[184:24.34]I know you can.
[184:24.82]Emmett Dalton.
[184:28.50]Why is he just walking over to me like the Terminator?
[184:31.00]He just...
[184:53.29]Um, why is he right here?
[184:55.15]I thought maybe I could... it gave me a cover system.
[185:14.82]Is there another place I can run to?
[185:17.58]Over there.
[185:17.94]Okay.
[185:25.07]Itchy leg.
[185:25.49]Ow.
[186:05.60]Go back this way.
[186:14.24]Ow!
[186:19.84]I just stopped- Oh, fuck.
[186:24.08]Oh, fuck.
[186:25.16]Please don't kill me.
[186:27.86]Come on!
[186:38.31]So we're going to do another retelling of the story from the other side?
[186:41.57]I got them all.
[186:42.29]Alright.
[186:42.47]Executioner.
[187:09.15]Uh, deal some headshots without even aiming.
[187:12.27]Pressing and holding Q will eat up all of your concentration in exchange for marking nearby enemies for execution with perfect headshots.
[187:21.46]The more concentration you sacrifice, the more of them will die.
[187:26.17]So this is actually the Deadeye from every... Why is this the case?
[187:39.78]Is there some lore or something behind why every Western game has to have a slowdown?
[187:45.84]Target everybody and then... That's in every single one of these.
[187:52.16]Because it's cool.
[187:52.78]I mean, it is cool, but it's in every single Western game.
[187:55.20]Is there nothing else we could do here?
[188:14.31]It's a trope from the movies.
[188:17.37]Yeah.
[188:25.04]Well, let's do it.
[188:26.92]And then we can get the golden rifle.
[188:30.08]I got it.
[188:34.70]I don't really care about these.
[188:35.60]I'm not going to use them.
[188:38.10]So I got the two weapons I want.
[188:40.23]Which leads us, let's see what's over here.
[188:41.61]Fast revolver reload.
[188:42.93]I need to get one of these.
[188:47.89]Silver shotgun.
[188:53.70]We'll take a look later.
[189:03.77]That's how the Wild West worked in real life.
[189:05.59]That's how Billy the Kid died.
[189:06.75]The sheriff slowed down time and blew his brains out.
[189:09.69]Oh my god.
[189:10.41]There it is.
[189:16.16]Golden Rifle.
[189:31.30]Oh my god, I love it.
[189:32.04]Dude, it's an Australian rifle.
[189:33.30]It is kind of an Australian rifle, isn't it?
[189:35.68]Does it make a different noise?
[189:36.60]I mean, it looks cool.
[189:38.12]I'm not gonna shoot this.
[190:01.13]It was early fall, right?
[190:03.11]Beautiful time of year.
[190:05.03]At least you had the weather on your side.
[190:07.68]By my recollection, it was damp and foggy as hell.
[190:11.44]I could have changed the title of this stream.
[190:20.65]That was funny for like 30 seconds.
[190:24.17]It was tough to stay on a true course, so we kept an eye out for landmarks.
[190:29.41]Okay, gotta go towards the, uh, bandanas.
[190:38.94]I don't know what the title is, though.
[190:43.44]It was never funny.
[190:44.20]I thought it was funny.
[190:47.52]We can, we can disagree on what we think is funny.
[191:06.46]Just name it Trope.
[191:17.79]What the fuck?
[191:27.71]Fog and swamps hinder orientation.
[191:29.45]The waypoint indicator is disabled.
[191:31.08]Great.
[191:34.32]Oh, I got a waypoint right now.
[191:36.76]I'm gonna get ambushed in a second.
[191:43.82]Just watch.
[191:48.55]No?
[191:50.53]I really thought they were gonna come out of the shadows.
[191:57.19]I'll take a secret.
[191:57.87]Ooh, there we go.
[191:58.83]Alright.
[192:01.35]Uh, what the hell do I want to do here?
[192:05.24]Yeah, I guess we could go up and then here for more combos.
[192:16.45]Plus, that's just... I can take more hits.
[192:21.53]We'll go up here.
[192:29.07]Oh, I... I gotta... I already did it.
[192:32.78]What?
[192:36.36]That was weird.
[192:36.88]Okay.
[192:37.20]I'll go this way.
[192:45.53]I was looking over.
[192:46.29]You know, this game, more than any... If I look over at my other monitor to chat or at stream labs for a second, I always time it.
[192:58.25]So somehow, I'm looking over to a different monitor when one of these guys pops up and wants me to press S.
[193:12.93]Okay, that's ridiculous.
[193:13.71]That is so insane.
[193:14.83]I don't even, you don't have to see anybody.
[193:17.49]I don't even have to aim at anyone.
[193:18.89]It does it in 180 degrees.
[193:41.84]I don't know.
[193:42.36]Why would I pick up any of these, really?
[193:43.50]Shotgunner.
[193:43.92]Why do these guys have beat-em-up names now?
[194:12.03]Can I not?
[194:12.43]What the hell?
[194:13.23]Why can I not hit Q?
[194:14.73]Do I have to be a full bar?
[194:17.43]I can't just slow it down at all?
[194:19.29]Oh, there we go.
[194:32.29]That was weird.
[194:33.93]Gotcha.
[194:39.05]Okay, and...
[194:43.15]What?
[194:43.39]Oh my god, he has extra health.
[195:04.48]Where are they coming from?
[195:05.52]Do you guys see this?
[195:10.10]Oh, they're...
[195:17.80]Down here.
[195:18.32]Blow this shit up.
[195:21.48]That guy's giant.
[195:23.56]Look at how huge that guy is.
[195:24.68]Oh, no.
[195:25.56]No, he is.
[195:26.08]Is he huge?
[195:27.82]He's as big as the house.
[195:34.74]I wasn't crazy right there, right?
[195:35.78]That guy was gigantic.
[195:38.10]He was... I scrambled up top to get a better view.
[195:45.48]Okay, that was really weird.
[195:47.26]He looked very big.
[195:57.95]Just get in there with actual weapons, please.
[196:00.73]That would be nice.
[196:05.61]Oh, I got one of them.
[196:06.95]Steve?
[196:32.71]Chat, you still with me?
[196:33.69]I think they're getting bored of the game.
[196:39.68]Did they?
[197:10.38]Indians?
[197:11.70]There were Indians?
[197:13.16]No.
[197:13.62]I want to play.
[197:14.36]Stop it.
[197:14.84]I just wanted to make sure Steve was paying attention.
[197:17.48]Now, where was I?
[197:19.80]You were following the Daltons through a swamp?
[197:23.38]That's right.
[197:24.28]See, Steve?
[197:25.42]Dwight's paying attention.
[197:26.98]Oh, I'm listening.
[197:28.66]I was just resting my eyes.
[197:32.36]So, where was I?
[197:34.52]The Daltons.
[197:35.70]Right.
[197:37.28]Just a bunch of old men talking.
[197:38.50]I swear to god video games are not even good.
[198:08.33]What's more important than family?
[198:10.47]I bet Ben knows what I'm talking about.
[198:15.13]That guy has diamond on his chest?
[198:29.08]Alright.
[198:31.02]That's the way we're gonna go.
[198:31.94]I thought I got two of them in a row.
[198:36.20]I thought it went right through their ears.
[198:43.05]Come on.
[198:43.63]Quickly.
[198:44.07]Anybody else?
[198:46.79]Oh, shit.
[198:47.87]That guy has a magic door.
[198:51.33]Whoa, whoa.
[198:51.81]Easy, easy, easy.
[199:05.15]I got him.
[199:05.67]I think I did it.
[199:09.01]I wish I could grab the door.
[199:09.97]That'd be fun.
[199:20.80]This exact location is insecure.
[199:22.38]There's a lady up here.
[199:27.85]There's a guy lying down right there.
[199:29.09]I just really... Talk about deja vu.
[199:38.35]That is... Okay, what is hitting me?
[199:49.89]Uh-oh.
[199:50.51]I shouldn't be up here.
[199:57.55]I have full ammo with that gun.
[200:03.82]That's it?
[200:07.94]I guess I have full ammo.
[200:08.86]I don't think I got him.
[200:27.77]It's fun to do that, but it takes too many bullets.
[200:33.40]Have I seen the new game about me on Steam?
[200:36.32]Uh, yeah, we played it on stream actually.
[200:39.80]We played it on stream.
[200:44.55]Oh, fuck.
[200:48.37]I'm dead.
[200:56.27]Of course the guy with the health pool is the one that I couldn't see.
[200:59.15]He blended in with the bushes because he has like a fucking green coat on.
[201:31.84]Where the fuck are these people?
[201:33.78]Like, where the fuck are you?
[201:35.26]Is this guy here?
[201:44.44]Stop dying.
[201:44.98]It's pissing me off.
[201:53.59]Where's the shotgun guy?
[201:55.27]He's, like, in there.
[202:00.99]Where is he?
[202:09.66]Look at that.
[202:13.35]That was like inside of this tree.
[202:23.47]Another boss fight, I think, coming up here.
[202:24.91]Let's load the guns.
[202:31.69]Oh fuck, I gotta change the title.
[202:43.23]That's when I saw it.
[202:44.69]A goddamn steamboat.
[202:46.81]A steamboat?
[202:48.31]In a swamp?
[202:49.47]Yeah, Steve, but this wasn't much more than a wreck.
[202:52.18]This looks like Borderlands.
[202:53.84]That's not even... Oh, my fucking God.
[202:56.88]I didn't know what to do.
[203:00.30]Stretching.
[203:01.44]Now, was it a sternwheeler or a sidewheeler?
[203:06.14]Does that really make a difference, Steve?
[203:08.42]It was a steamboat with a goddamn army on board.
[203:13.18]That it?
[203:13.66]There's probably a secret in here.
[203:16.32]I would be shocked if there wasn't.
[203:42.52]Where's it going?
[203:43.70]That was odd.
[203:45.48]Teleporting bullets.
[203:50.19]Let's get up there.
[203:57.69]Can I get in?
[204:06.64]Climb?
[204:09.32]A nugget.
[204:10.34]Hmm.
[204:14.89]Might be up top.
[204:16.63]Yeah.
[204:19.35]It's probably on the edge.
[204:20.13]Oh my god, that guy has a shotgun.
[204:30.71]I do it.
[204:33.66]Surrender just ain't in my nature.
[204:36.64]Plus, I'm stubborn as hell.
[204:43.05]I mean, that is effective too.
[204:46.25]Don't always have to aim down sights.
[204:47.61]You can just shoot them.
[204:59.82]Gotta go that way.
[205:14.61]That's why it's so goddamn fun.
[205:18.89]It is very fun.
[205:22.39]There are other game modes, too.
[205:24.87]We gotta try those out.
[205:27.55]There's dual mode, there's arcade mode.
[205:31.83]It's not just the story, so there's a little bit more to see.
[205:35.17]Once I complete the game.
[205:38.65]Which I don't know exactly where I am in the story right now, but... We'll find out, right?
[205:54.77]Let's do it.
[205:55.05]Oh, the double cross.
[206:24.31]The Daltons had played me like a fiddle.
[206:27.31]Apparently the vigilantes were on their damn favor.
[206:29.91]It's burning down.
[206:30.75]I have to get out of the burning.
[206:32.45]They wanted to burn me alive.
[206:35.52]But finding my way out of a burning labyrinth proved to be quite a challenge.
[206:40.72]It was a riverboat, right?
[206:41.94]I mean, it's not like it was a goddamn ocean.
[206:44.22]Well, yeah, but I was in a fight.
[206:47.02]I'm going up.
[206:48.02]I don't think I should be going up the stairs.
[206:49.50]I think I need to go down the stairs.
[206:51.08]This is so dumb.
[207:08.65]I got out.
[207:09.25]What the fuck?
[207:09.85]All that- we got a lot of information there very quickly.
[207:39.56]I'm gonna get a lot of experience here.
[207:52.62]19, 20... 22... 23... Dude, these are like Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[207:58.51]That's where I am in my combo right now.
[208:03.55]I'm at Flamin' Hot Cheeto level.
[208:09.45]Come on, is that it?
[208:11.33]33?
[208:11.35]I think that's it.
[208:15.45]No, this guy right here!
[208:16.37]Oh, it's okay.
[208:17.20]It's alright, got 33.
[208:17.98]Oh, God.
[208:18.20]How am I gonna do this?
[208:19.26]The guy in the back?
[208:43.46]No, no!
[208:50.27]Did it.
[208:50.63]They got it wrong.
[208:52.47]A sad end for those two.
[208:54.95]If they'd only known that Emmett was still alive despite his wounds.
[209:00.76]I rolled 14 units.
[209:01.78]It was the guy in the back, I got it right.
[209:03.06]He moved to California and sold real estate and lived off the legend of that fateful day.
[209:09.02]And the tragic death of his two brothers.
[209:12.88]So how do you dishonorably kill somebody?
[209:15.37]You just shoot them without waiting for them to shoot first?
[209:18.17]To pull first?
[209:29.19]Yeah, okay, I see.
[209:34.20]More combos.
[209:34.80]I can do it again.
[209:37.58]But hold on, let me... I want to see what's further down this tree.
[209:44.13]Hmm.
[209:45.45]Cold Rage.
[209:46.41]Damaging concentration.
[209:53.23]Reload while sprinting.
[209:54.45]That's actually really good.
[209:59.68]Yeah, I think I want that.
[210:01.48]I move around a lot.
[210:03.42]I run around all over the place.
[210:04.46]This game looks super fun.
[210:06.98]Is it a blast?
[210:07.70]Yeah, it's fun.
[210:11.96]I'm actually glad I get to play it.
[210:14.32]Tried to play this like two years ago on stream and then gave up on it because I couldn't get it to work.
[210:19.21]And here we are now.
[210:21.43]I want to get this.
[210:22.75]So I'm going to go down this way.
[210:26.44]I want the sprinting reload.
[210:35.30]Am I going to change the stream title?
[210:37.08]Yes.
[210:38.10]After I get out of this.
[210:39.70]Episode 7, The Wild Bunch.
[210:41.72]Juarez, 1868.
[210:45.23]Mexico.
[210:59.71]One night after my brothers retired for the evening, I found a little poker game in a cantina with a couple of cowboys.
[211:08.47]And I just couldn't lose.
[211:10.87]I even won an old Spanish coin that had to be a hundred years old.
[211:14.67]You want ads?
[211:16.22]Later.
[211:16.80]Not right now.
[211:18.08]I was mighty pleased with myself the next morning as my brothers and I rode for Texas.
[211:23.68]But before we crossed the border, those cowboys caught up with us.
[211:28.35]It was Johnny Ringo, Roscoe Bob Bryant, and another asshole named Jim.
[211:33.65]They wanted their money back and everything else we had, including our lives, as those boys didn't want us coming for them later.
[211:42.58]Bob put that old Spanish coin in my mouth and said, I won't have it said that I left you with nothing, boy.
[211:50.80]Am I gonna play Dreams for PS4?
[211:51.90]Yeah.
[211:52.12]I'm really excited for it, actually.
[211:53.50]I've been looking forward to it.
[211:55.62]But Bob eluded me.
[211:55.98]Until I heard he was riding with the Wild Bunch.
[212:24.68]It's in early... Isn't it in, um... I thought it was in, like, super, super early access.
[212:33.94]Like, you have to get invited to play at early access.
[212:38.91]I don't know.
[212:39.29]I thought that was the case.
[212:39.93]Alright.
[212:40.09]So, give me one second.
[212:41.59]I'm going to... I'm gonna pee.
[212:52.69]Because I drank a bunch of fucking water.
[212:55.33]And then I'm going to finish this game.
[212:56.95]It seems like I think we're almost at the end, right?
[212:58.85]Another, like, three or four missions.
[213:01.05]And then I'm going to do the duels and then the arcade mode.
[213:03.35]Play it for a little while longer.
[213:04.17]I'm going to change the title of the stream.
[213:07.51]To... Juarez.
[213:11.01]Um... That's the title.
[213:21.96]Just Juarez and then like a dot.
[213:27.76]I'll be right back.
[217:24.43]And I'm back.
[217:24.77]Let's keep going.
[217:37.75]I shook that up too much.
[217:38.67]Fuck.
[217:49.69]More beer.
[217:51.96]It's not beer.
[218:00.46]No, it's pineapple juice.
[218:03.28]I'm a huge pineapple guy, if you guys didn't know this.
[218:09.50]Pineapple juice, pineapple slices, pineapple flavoring.
[218:16.90]Except get that shit off pizza.
[218:23.53]Yeah, I see you.
[218:24.25]How are you?
[218:28.07]Somebody heard that as they were driving by.
[218:31.16]I think I'm really fucking mad.
[218:39.70]I'm just kidding.
[218:41.32]I love pineapple.
[218:42.06]I just, I love pineapple.
[218:43.36]It's my favorite fruit ever.
[218:45.50]It's better than apples, it's better than pears, better than oranges.
[218:49.06]I just don't like it on my pizza.
[218:51.02]I like pepperoni pizza.
[218:52.34]That's it.
[218:53.64]I don't like anything else.
[218:55.39]I don't really, you know, meat lovers too much.
[218:57.19]Just pepperoni.
[218:58.35]With a flat, crispy, thin crust.
[219:03.11]God damn it, now I want that.
[219:05.35]You don't deserve pizza.
[219:06.79]Jesus.
[219:07.31]Why?
[219:07.51]How do you deserve pizza?
[219:09.49]You just buy it.
[219:11.13]No, boy.
[219:11.57]A circus like that would have slowed me down.
[219:14.48]Besides, I wanted Bryant all to myself.
[219:30.97]Don't eat too much pineapple, though.
[219:32.31]It has bromelain in it.
[219:33.19]That's why your mouth hurts when you eat it.
[220:05.99]No, that's real.
[220:06.43]That's real.
[220:06.67]They blew the bridge with the intention of forcing the train to stop.
[220:13.12]Well, I assume the Wild Bunch was likely in the still intact part of the train high above.
[220:18.34]So I had no choice but to make my way up to the passenger cars dangling down.
[220:25.12]Pineapple eats you.
[220:26.46]Yes, it does.
[220:27.73]I was determined to make that sumbitch Bob pay for what he did to my brothers.
[220:34.28]Weirdly enough, yes, there's an enzyme in pineapple that is a flesh-eating enzyme.
[220:38.99]And it is eating your flesh while you put it in your mouth and your body and stuff.
[220:42.78]But it's actually kind of good for you.
[220:44.18]Just don't eat it too much.
[220:59.53]I found the device they used to blow the traps.
[221:02.04]Oh, okay.
[221:02.36]So I knew I was headed in the right direction.
[221:06.66]Did I miss a cool thing?
[221:08.64]I just wasn't paying attention?
[221:09.88]What?
[221:11.90]Wait, rewind.
[221:12.88]Tell the story again.
[221:13.84]Somebody else tell a different version of it.
[221:19.67]My ears are still ringing from blowing up that bridge.
[221:23.47]What'd you say?
[221:24.85]I can't hear a goddamn thing.
[221:28.33]What the hell is what you say?
[221:29.15]Oh no, I got shot in the head.
[221:30.47]What the hell?
[221:31.09]He's gonna shoot the horse, calling it now.
[221:32.43]Nope.
[221:32.57]Not gonna do that.
[221:33.27]Thought I was gonna do that too.
[222:03.07]You think that's too easy for me to do that, but look at how crazy that is.
[222:07.23]Are you happy?
[222:24.74]Are you happy?
[222:26.75]Like I did the stupid thing.
[222:35.86]Eliminate train robbers.
[222:36.40]Let's try to get some points here.
[223:07.17]no oh right here as I mentioned before I am not fond of heights but I was too busy dodging bullets to worry about falling to my death odds were I was likely to die that day anyway oh god damn it so I was determined to take down as many of those bastards as I could it's a little ledge it's tiny come on give me a break
[223:58.08]That was a cool move.
[223:58.66]I didn't even do that.
[223:59.28]He did it on his own.
[224:07.29]Do I have to go back on the outside?
[224:11.73]This doesn't open.
[224:12.71]I guess I can go this way?
[224:23.00]Okay, they were just in the way.
[224:25.03]I didn't even do that.
[224:25.81]Somebody else fell on top of it with a match in their hand.
[224:36.85]Um... Secret.
[224:45.69]Alright.
[224:45.87]Alright, back around the corner.
[224:51.06]I can go up.
[224:55.74]I kept hoping the law would show up and give me a hand.
[224:58.58]Like that giant Pinkerton posse that I read about.
[225:01.54]Pinkertons?
[225:02.23]Goddamn Pinkertons.
[225:19.38]Joe, Jeff, and Tim.
[225:23.40]Grand Posse versus the Wild Bunch.
[225:27.83]Here it comes.
[225:29.19]You've been waiting for this.
[225:34.16]Oh.
[225:34.64]Well, that's great.
[225:42.81]Oh, one dead.
[225:45.27]Okay, another wild boy.
[225:47.67]All the wild boys dead.
[225:49.39]Wasn't even that hard.
[225:50.29]It was actually pretty easy.
[226:17.50]Nugget.
[226:18.68]Where?
[226:21.54]On the outside of the train, maybe?
[226:23.02]I don't know.
[226:23.50]Outside, left, right, down, up.
[226:43.51]Whoa, he's alive!
[226:44.25]Oh.
[226:53.26]Right next to me.
[226:54.14]It's inside the... that was... they made that really easy to find that.
[226:59.24]What was that?
[227:02.71]Chase the Wild Bunch.
[227:03.35]Does he have money?
[227:11.10]Only a few stragglers were left.
[227:12.68]I had to cut them down pronto if I was going to stay on old Bob's trail.
[227:16.43]One light's given to me.
[227:28.70]I want more levels.
[227:41.20]Um, was it there in... Okay, I can't... Get off it, get off it, just get off it and hide.
[227:48.91]What a stupid fucking idea that was.
[227:50.57]That was the dumbest idea I've ever had.
[228:05.90]Duck?
[228:07.90]Once I silenced all those guns, I went searching for my nemesis, determined to finally have my justice.
[228:15.04]But the only survivor who welcomed me was George Flatnose Curry.
[228:19.34]Who was he?
[228:19.86]The fastest gun in the gang.
[228:22.79]Great.
[228:23.65]Right after Sundance, I mean.
[228:26.49]And Kid Curry.
[228:27.73]And maybe LZ Lay.
[228:28.83]Though some folks might dispute that.
[228:34.87]Uh...
[228:41.48]You gonna go for it?
[228:42.16]Who's gonna go for it?
[228:47.75]I shot that fucking ground.
[229:02.15]He stops right here for a second so I can get a good focus right here.
[229:08.54]Oh god.
[229:11.16]This is gonna be bad.
[229:14.60]I've already fucked it up, but I think I can still get it.
[229:18.82]I shot him!
[229:24.52]I shot him right in the... Does he have a bulletproof vest on?
[229:27.72]What the fuck was that?
[229:28.46]This is gonna be it.
[229:51.33]What happened there?
[229:51.91]What happened there?
[230:26.54]As long as I stay above 50%, that means I had the majority of accuracy, right?
[230:48.96]Alright.
[230:49.24]I like how it still does the story.
[230:51.26]What did I want to do here?
[230:52.29]What did I actually want to do?
[230:54.13]It was over here, right?
[230:54.91]Oh, alright.
[230:55.35]Sprinting Reload.
[231:37.41]Got reload How many other ways I tracked those boys to a camera one two three four oh
[232:07.19]Barrels not a person just in case you were wondering Number that didn't bother with a warning shot.
[232:19.44]I just started taking those best At least I get it because it was medical by a guy hiding in the barrel I
[232:34.26]That would be possible, right?
[232:35.26]Clues?
[232:58.64]uh find clues as to the whereabouts of the how about the map that they drew a map with their bold plan clearly marked this time they were fixing to blow up a train trestle property of the union pacific the plan clearly indicated how they were fixing to undermine several of the weakest wooden supports another game
[233:35.49]This is in another game.
[233:36.87]What game is this in?
[233:40.87]I swear this is in... This happens.
[233:45.15]The same... Gun.
[233:46.33]Gun.
[233:46.90]Right.
[233:48.24]Okay.
[233:48.66]Yeah.
[233:49.24]What happened to my weapons?
[233:55.12]Why did I... It took away my cool weapons and gave me shitty ones.
[233:59.84]Alright.
[234:00.06]Prevent them from blowing it up.
[234:02.26]I'll do my best.
[234:06.02]Did I have a beep gun?
[234:07.76]I don't remember.
[234:10.80]Did I?
[234:11.12]I don't think so.
[234:20.39]Kid Curry had bragged to a whore how he was gonna rob a train heading to the U.S.
[234:24.73]Mint in Denver.
[234:25.97]And that whore, Fat Sally, she told me.
[234:32.22]The bridge was rigged with dynamite, so I decided I best be careful confronting those bastards.
[234:38.43]Exactly.
[234:39.67]One misplaced shot and that could easily have happened.
[234:44.29]That wasn't for a joke or anything.
[234:45.76]I just wanted to see if it actually did that.
[234:49.20]I didn't know if that was just like a joke for like, you know, like, okay, you can disarm them.
[234:53.02]I didn't know.
[234:53.42]I was just seeing if it actually did it.
[234:54.88]This way.
[235:20.71]No, don't do that.
[235:23.25]It's gonna take us all out.
[235:24.53]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[235:31.99]Disarm, right?
[235:32.99]Disarm!
[235:33.29]Why can I not disarm?
[235:47.95]That's what I'm saying, that's what I'm trying to do.
[235:49.91]Load, load, load, load, load, load.
[235:51.31]Oh, right in the face.
[236:24.95]Don't, don't blow, no no no no no, oh god, did I blow it up?
[236:28.54]Don't blow things up, that's bad.
[236:46.98]Armored Shotgunner, that's... Did I get him?
[236:59.06]Got him.
[237:01.52]That was scary.
[237:16.52]Oh, God.
[237:17.82]We have community subs just come in.
[237:20.40]Uh, Jerma's average dong gave, how, is it 10?
[237:23.72]20?
[237:24.02]How many?
[237:24.68]I didn't see it.
[237:26.17]Pixel Mike, 5 community subs.
[237:28.09]Jerma's average dong, 10 community subs.
[237:31.53]Thank you, guys.
[237:35.27]Thank you for the community subs.
[237:37.58]You guys are awesome.
[237:40.42]He he he said it.
[237:42.72]Yes, he did.
[237:46.18]Let's get me a new gun.
[237:47.04]Increased range and piercing power.
[237:52.76]It's now easier to hit what you're aiming at.
[237:55.76]And look good while you're doing it.
[237:58.64]Be quick as greased lightning.
[237:59.70]You'll be able to move and run 50% faster.
[238:02.96]Let's get it.
[238:03.40]So this is an engraved ranger.
[238:08.50]So it's 25% range.
[238:10.34]So it's better range, less recoil.
[238:12.74]What's the other one?
[238:14.59]This is faster fire rate and faster aim speed.
[238:17.11]No, I don't have it.
[238:30.01]Okay, well, let's shoot the rope.
[238:45.59]No, I didn't get it all.
[238:49.65]Oh, what?
[238:55.43]That guy was just wood in my brain.
[238:57.17]Is that the last guy?
[239:14.55]Once I removed it, my path was pretty clear.
[239:21.65]Ah, come on.
[239:22.09]He was standing still.
[239:24.25]What the fuck?
[239:26.03]I did... I thought I shot him twice?
[239:29.32]There we go.
[239:37.58]I don't like these quick shooters.
[239:38.90]They're terrible.
[239:45.31]Don't blow those up.
[239:47.07]Bad move, Jeremy, bad move.
[239:58.29]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[240:00.09]Whoa.
[240:01.41]So I proceeded onward.
[240:03.45]I realized that that way just wasn't gonna work.
[240:06.50]I needed an alternate path forward.
[240:12.10]The upgraded quick shooters are OP.
[240:15.26]Are they?
[240:21.24]Find an alternate path to reach the other part of the overpass.
[240:27.45]Let's go.
[240:31.55]Nugget.
[240:34.61]Where the hell is it?
[240:35.13]I think it's above me.
[240:41.54]This place is cool, but I kinda wanna get out of fuckin' Blighttown.
[240:55.34]Where is it?
[240:55.80]Is it down here?
[241:04.96]Where's this thing?
[241:10.01]It's right there.
[241:13.69]Shit.
[241:14.37]Alright, how do I get that?
[241:17.67]It's right there.
[241:18.25]Alright, I gotta go up and then down.
[241:35.34]Good.
[241:36.82]Alright.
[241:37.64]Find an alternate route.
[241:42.00]So we gotta go that way.
[241:44.26]So how do I get to there?
[241:45.46]Can I just go down?
[241:50.22]What happens if I go down?
[241:51.02]Wait a minute.
[241:55.44]Guess I'm just gonna run over here?
[241:56.68]Oh god.
[241:56.86]Jerma's average size dong.
[242:10.46]Five community subs.
[242:12.60]No, five!
[242:14.64]It was twenty... Five.
[242:22.37]Five.
[242:23.67]What's happening?
[242:24.65]Chase and extinguish the fuse?
[242:26.81]Thank you for the... Thank you for the twenty community subs.
[242:29.48]I really appreciate it.
[242:31.94]Where's the fuse?
[242:33.82]That just fucking scared the shit out of me.
[242:42.25]uh but thank you for the 20 community subs nugget somewhere it's right there okay can I get up the burning fuse was so damn quick I had to run like the wind I almost had it but no thought I was gonna have a coronary when I lost sight of those sparks my heart was pounding like a sledgehammer
[243:16.80]He's shooting the fuse.
[243:18.02]I was trying to extinguish What tell us tell us Okay, thank you.
[243:34.70]Of course.
[243:35.06]I was successful or clearly I wouldn't be talking to you folks here today Naturally, I removed the last dynamite charge.
[243:42.86]Oh
[243:45.39]What?
[243:53.21]Did somebody just cut off my story?
[243:56.85]Did somebody come into the bar and grab a glass and sit down and start telling their side?
[244:00.15]I walked off accidentally.
[244:02.90]I didn't press space.
[244:04.28]Thank god the game knows I'm stupid.
[244:26.18]Oh, that's right.
[244:26.64]I forgot the nugget.
[244:27.48]Oh, well.
[244:28.46]It's okay.
[244:30.67]It's alright.
[244:31.03]Alright.
[244:52.91]My body was just moving around in such weird directions.
[244:56.09]Alright, let me just chill for a sec.
[245:06.36]What?
[245:08.83]Why do those guys die?
[245:19.96]He's not going for the 100% run.
[245:21.08]No, I'm not going for the 100%.
[245:22.32]I'm going for any percent.
[245:23.40]Oh.
[245:23.52]There's Kid Curry.
[245:50.33]Well, he has a great line of sight.
[246:07.22]Jeez.
[246:07.84]Alright, there he is.
[246:16.52]I'm trying to shoot through the hole.
[246:18.24]I don't think that's gonna work.
[246:33.49]It's gonna have to get close.
[246:37.35]Shoot.
[246:37.59]Right down there.
[246:38.92]Dynamite.
[246:40.38]There's apparently a... there's a nugget somewhere over here?
[246:49.02]Probably in the wagon.
[247:05.79]Is that far enough?
[247:08.22]That's not far enough.
[247:08.82]I gotta go... I gotta run in, throw the ball, and run back.
[247:17.82]That's all the damage that did.
[247:24.42]Oh, it hurts.
[247:31.69]Oh no, no, no, no!
[247:50.05]What?
[247:53.09]I... Is this guy real?
[248:00.59]Oh, I'm so upset by that one.
[248:03.48]Oh, fuck you.
[248:04.84]Get outta here.
[248:26.67]Why would you set him up running straight at me?
[248:34.96]Holy fucking Jesus!
[248:36.56]What?
[248:36.80]Where'd he go?
[248:39.36]What the fuck is it?
[248:42.80]What?
[248:43.80]My fucking god.
[248:45.06]Oh, come on.
[248:49.21]Whatever, I know it.
[249:16.62]Okay, here comes the guy.
[249:18.74]He's gonna sprint over here.
[249:26.29]Oh god, that's not good.
[249:32.95]Is he still alive?
[249:35.15]He's not still alive, right?
[249:39.80]Okay, here we go.
[249:55.54]Eventually I brought that tunnel down.
[249:57.08]Got it.
[249:58.58]That's when I met Kid Curry himself.
[250:01.02]Let's go.
[250:01.83]Duel.
[250:01.99]He decided to stop pussyfooting around and deal with me personally.
[250:07.43]This is gonna hurt.
[250:17.93]Get that speed up.
[250:31.16]This guy's dead.
[250:40.35]Shit.
[251:03.10]As fast as he was, I was just a bit faster.
[251:10.74]And as he lay wounded, I demanded to know the whereabouts of Roscoe Bob Bryant.
[251:16.16]He shouted at me.
[251:17.68]He pointed the gun at me.
[251:20.87]Bob went with Butch's Sundance to South America.
[251:24.39]You ain't never finding him.
[251:26.19]Ha ha!
[251:33.15]Good thing I was paying attention and not looking at chat.
[251:38.05]Imagine letting that guy shoot you.
[251:41.13]East down south, you bastard.
[251:45.53]You'll never find him.
[251:47.72]Thanks for the info.
[251:49.54]Headshot. 71%.
[252:05.14]There's a lot of stories.
[252:33.36]Sometimes I think about stuff like this.
[252:36.52]My life is not even 1% as interesting as this guy's.
[252:42.78]I mean, the coolest story I have is one time I got two double cheeseburgers when I ordered one.
[252:48.92]I'll tell you a story about the extra couple nuggets I got.
[253:00.01]Which is why there was such a rich bounty on their heads.
[253:02.86]They just put, like, more fries in the bag!
[253:04.52]Dead or alive, that's one hell of a payday.
[253:26.41]Meanwhile, they forget my fries four times.
[253:32.06]This is the new gun.
[253:33.00]I didn't hit the guy right here.
[253:34.26]This is the new one, yeah.
[253:35.29]Engraved Ranger.
[253:37.17]Another train mission.
[253:37.99]Oh, God.
[254:00.43]I just crouched and I took the shotgun right in the face.
[254:02.75]I'm trying to duck from a shotgun.
[254:11.00]That's not gonna happen.
[254:21.20]I'm gonna get like 20 points here.
[254:26.36]See if I can get it.
[254:36.36]Damn it.
[254:36.82]It's hard to string it together in these missions.
[254:41.43]Jesse James!
[254:42.69]There we go.
[254:43.21]Legend was... He could stop a train with his bare hands.
[255:06.65]by staring it down.
[255:07.71]Jesse James.
[255:10.80]They hopped a freight train, having heard there was a big payroll in the express safe.
[255:16.48]So, I hopped the same train.
[255:20.52]What the heck just happened?
[255:25.92]They're behind me?
[255:30.17]James' younger gang was decimated after that little fiasco they had in Northfield, Minnesota.
[255:37.07]Unless we got... Okay, this is done.
[255:43.89]I can lead into here.
[255:47.15]Improve damage and concentration.
[255:48.80]Just focus to do even more damage.
[255:51.58]All you bullets shot in concentration... Yeah, but 50% more of a headshot is... They're dead.
[255:59.00]They already were dead.
[256:00.82]All I do are headshots.
[256:03.74]It doesn't really matter.
[256:06.82]More concentration in the bar, that's actually good.
[256:11.91]And then, uh, dynamite looting.
[256:15.31]Eh, the explosive stuff really not... didn't really do it for me.
[256:20.07]Uh... Extra damage on combos.
[256:24.52]Yeah, let's go up this way.
[256:25.52]Nugget somewhere.
[256:37.95]Climbing around that train, I must have swallowed a hundred damn bugs before I reached it.
[256:42.17]The James Younger gang pulled the first train robbery west of the Mississippi.
[256:45.96]Sounds like you hold them in high regard.
[256:48.78]Everyone knows they were the most famous outlaw gang ever.
[256:51.72]And you took them all on by your lonesome.
[256:54.40]Again.
[256:55.62]I'm planning this all a little hard to swallow.
[256:59.22]But maybe you need to wash it down with some whiskey.
[257:02.17]By the way, did I mention that that train was flying down those tracks like a bat?
[257:07.52]Come on, more.
[257:10.90]Damn it.
[257:21.26]Air burst.
[257:28.64]Nugget?
[257:29.30]Oh god.
[257:38.83]I thought I heard the nuggets sound.
[257:48.14]Am I gonna go take a piss?
[257:50.08]Again.
[258:12.80]See, he pees just as much as I do.
[258:14.28]Up?
[258:14.34]There are no enemies.
[258:15.02]I have to tell the story so enemies can show up.
[258:17.71]I'm just in a giant loop.
[258:38.21]Jack?
[258:38.35]What?
[258:38.51]I have to break the cycle?
[259:06.35]It was a rickety ride and quite precarious.
[259:19.33]It worked!
[259:24.81]I gotta- where's the- I have to P-Line.
[259:34.00]I've never heard so much malarkey in my life.
[259:37.06]You think he's bullshitting us?
[259:39.35]You don't think he's Silas Greaves?
[259:41.35]I think he's just some old drunk looking for some free liquor.
[259:48.93]Where is this story coming from?
[259:58.39]I'm not telling this portion.
[260:01.41]This is the audience talking now.
[260:02.85]What?
[260:23.85]Did I mention that this gem was married to the infamous Bell Star?
[260:27.77]Of course, I didn't learn that until later.
[260:31.18]That went really, really fast.
[260:33.56]He didn't even have a chance to come back.
[260:37.84]He didn't pull his pants up.
[260:39.34]He's sitting here with his pants around his ankles.
[260:42.86]I hope that I have to do the whole thing again.
[260:50.61]Thank god.
[260:58.73]It was definitely safer on the inside of the train.
[261:01.59]I am on the... I don't understand.
[261:03.19]That wasn't the inside of the train?
[261:09.43]Did I fall off?
[261:11.53]I don't think it... That's weird.
[261:14.07]Yeah.
[261:20.21]I just got shot right in the face No wonder each and every asshole on that train wanted me dead Oh
[261:44.88]He was doing so many animations that I couldn't shoot him.
[261:48.96]I can't believe what just happened.
[262:02.05]I didn't even get outplayed.
[262:04.53]Outplayed?
[262:05.59]No, I think he shot me off the train.
[262:11.73]Where the fuck am I right now?
[262:22.48]What is happening?
[262:30.54]Didn't I have to go?
[262:38.58]It wasn't like this before.
[262:41.70]Was it?
[262:42.04]Did this happen before?
[262:45.64]What did it just... Where did it put me?
[262:47.04]This is not where the... Okay.
[262:50.78]Why did it put me there?
[262:52.71]Did it, like, skip me ahead?
[262:53.73]Yeah, it put me ahead.
[263:16.90]That was weird.
[263:20.73]It's just like, hey, go this way.
[263:22.43]Remember how you died twice?
[263:23.83]Can you get the mud off your face?
[263:30.85]What the fuck is going on?
[263:49.49]I wondered if I was ever going to find the front of that train.
[263:52.85]Or the bastard I was after.
[263:54.60]Jesse hired a damn army after Northfield.
[263:57.66]Guess he didn't want to be outgunned like that.
[264:00.46]Where's this gatling?
[264:01.74]I was attacked by some asshole on a gatling gun.
[264:04.82]Another one of these.
[264:07.08]Seems like you run into a lot of them.
[264:09.57]Where's this nugget?
[264:10.35]Can I climb up?
[264:12.71]Yes, I did.
[264:14.17]Now, I don't remember how I took it out.
[264:16.35]I don't think I can get that.
[264:17.47]Or dynamite.
[264:19.46]Got it.
[264:19.88]Oh, Jesus.
[264:52.02]I'm just gonna stay down.
[265:01.84]That didn't hit him?
[265:03.43]That looked like it hit him.
[265:20.69]What?! !
[265:22.42]Wasn't he done?
[265:23.12]He was done shooting!
[265:25.14]He was in the middle of... What the fuck?
[265:38.37]He was done shooting.
[265:39.25]I just instantly died.
[265:59.89]Alright, you can stop any second now.
[266:01.37]I'm gonna get up to there.
[266:33.13]That was a lot.
[266:40.24]No, I'm just gonna do it this way.
[266:46.55]He's dead.
[267:06.87]What the fuck?
[267:07.63]I'm gonna- Okay, you move now.
[267:09.61]Will you fu- Just stop shooting!
[268:05.85]Why did that do so little damage?
[268:08.47]I was gonna shoot him in the fucking head.
[268:27.49]Dumbest thing.
[268:35.54]Now it's my turn.
[268:38.08]These are just like Meat Boy replays of me coming at that guy.
[268:41.78]Remember when I did that?
[268:59.74]That was crazy.
[269:07.08]This is a hard level.
[269:12.52]Is that it?
[269:14.80]Shoot that stupid son of a bitch.
[269:19.36]Ooh, I got that.
[269:26.98]I was looking for Jim and shooting any son of a bitch stupid enough to get in my way.
[269:31.46]Jim, you on the train?
[269:32.90]And that included Jesse James himself.
[269:43.95]This happened already!
[269:46.86]Didn't we do this already?
[269:48.12]The same exact scenario with the armored shotgun guy behind the veil and the nugget.
[269:55.06]Right?
[269:55.28]This happened already.
[270:14.18]Am I supposed to be doing something here?
[270:17.28]What?
[270:17.54]Wait, it just took all my juice.
[270:22.66]Jesse James, again?
[270:23.96]Oh, right, we rewound and did the whole thing again.
[270:27.44]Okay, okay, right, right, right.
[270:36.24]It was then that Jesse detached the express car from the rest of the damn train.
[270:45.76]I could see Jesse waiting for me.
[270:48.17]Fixing to kill me so he can get away.
[270:50.17]Do I walk over here?
[270:51.29]I have to walk through this?
[270:54.53]No.
[270:55.03]I almost just walked in and died.
[270:56.35]Good.
[270:56.99]You had a showdown with Jesse James?
[270:59.23]Of course he didn't.
[271:00.82]Everybody knows that Jesse was killed by Bob Ford.
[271:04.00]Yeah.
[271:04.92]Jesse went out like John Wesley Harden.
[271:07.60]Cowards shot him in the back of the head.
[271:10.02]Guess it doesn't matter how far you run, does it, man?
[271:13.58]Your past always catches up with you.
[271:18.41]This shit's moving around all over the place.
[271:26.61]He was terrible.
[271:27.15]Not bad.
[271:54.29]Then I was going to come up here to more concentration bar.
[272:00.12]And then leading to extra damage.
[272:04.72]Very cool.
[272:08.82]How are the people here that never heard the phrase, wet my whistle?
[272:22.95]You never heard that before?
[272:26.40]That's been around forever.
[272:27.54]Get through the hostile territory and find Jim.
[272:29.92]Just like broke all my bones.
[272:30.86]What was that little ding there?
[272:35.94]What was that little ding?
[272:58.71]I think we've already replayed this mission.
[273:01.83]He's told the story so strangely so many times.
[273:05.85]I remember this exact location.
[273:28.99]Remember this?
[273:31.35]Like I fell, but it was a good advantage.
[273:48.87]I want to get combo here.
[273:55.36]No, no, no!
[273:55.66]Don't slow it down!
[274:05.08]I wanted to go fast.
[274:06.06]Yeah, see?
[274:06.68]I remember this.
[274:08.15]Jesus Christ.
[274:29.92]Okay.
[274:30.82]Alright.
[274:31.38]Somebody replay it.
[274:32.36]Somebody replay that whole thing on a clip and look at it and slow it down.
[274:34.87]I feel like I like fucking three times.
[274:37.61]Play it again.
[275:11.62]This guy's just running around.
[275:13.68]No, hurry, hurry, come on.
[275:16.42]How many ammo?
[275:17.38]Nice.
[275:17.78]Pretty good voice, actually.
[275:43.98]Won't you spare me over till another year?
[275:49.20]What is this that I can't see with ice-cold hands taking hold of me?
[276:00.33]Well, I am death, none can excel.
[276:05.43]I'll open the door to heaven or hell.
[276:13.62]And I stand unshaken.
[276:17.42]Oh, death, won't you spare me over?
[276:23.72]And I stand unshaken.
[276:33.95]I didn't ruin it, he was done.
[276:34.97]Uh, do I have to dodge these?
[277:02.58]Won't you spare me over till another year?
[277:08.08]So, are you going to answer the question?
[277:10.40]What question is that?
[277:11.82]Jim Reed.
[277:13.46]Did you ever find it?
[277:14.93]Reed was indeed that song that you certainly heard.
[277:19.77]That's right, Ben.
[277:22.39]A despicable character.
[277:24.19]I remember him laughing like a hyena that cold morning they lynched me and my brothers.
[277:29.99]Now, here we are.
[277:30.57]That's... Frank James.
[277:31.51]Frank James.
[277:32.15]Get to the hilltop and avoid the sniper's bullets.
[278:00.32]Uh, alright.
[278:00.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[278:01.68]I need... This is extra damage during combos.
[278:08.29]After fourth level combo, your bullets will do 100% more damage.
[278:12.05]Eh, that actually kind of sucks.
[278:13.47]Let me roll some of these.
[278:27.13]These are all based on the shotgun.
[278:28.47]Come closer.
[278:29.07]More concentration for full blast.
[278:30.63]Yeah, it's all shotgun.
[278:35.57]Mmm.
[278:40.24]Yeah, I guess we'll get it.
[278:41.12]I'll end up with the quick shooter.
[278:48.16]We'll go down here.
[278:48.76]Frank Jane.
[279:01.09]Jesus, don't even give me a second, man.
[279:02.43]Come on.
[279:10.47]Whoa, where's he?
[279:19.77]Um... I have the reaction time of a pineapple?
[279:25.15]I was just looking in the menu!
[279:29.51]I'm in the menu doing points and I come out and die in a tenth of a second.
[279:33.98]That's pineapple reactions?
[279:44.72]Why did it not go through?
[279:45.54]He's up there.
[279:56.14]I'm gonna go this way.
[280:10.20]That doesn't even make any sense.
[280:12.42]I shouldn't even laugh at that so I don't enable that kind of behavior in chat.
[280:19.17]I shouldn't even be laughing.
[280:22.85]I should be... I should go... Time that guy out quick.
[280:26.79]Okay.
[280:26.95]That's what I should have done.
[280:33.14]I'm guessing Frank James believed I was responsible for the demise of his brother Jesse.
[280:37.88]I couldn't really disagree with the man as I thought Jesse was dead then as well.
[280:44.61]Make your... What does it say?
[280:45.65]Make your what?
[280:46.79]Make your what?
[280:47.99]It could be anything.
[280:48.75]Make your bed.
[280:50.49]Make your taxes.
[280:52.33]Make your gun shoot.
[280:53.38]What does it say?
[280:54.04]Make your what?
[280:57.20]That could have been anything.
[281:00.77]So he's not there?
[281:01.65]Secret.
[281:02.17]Told ya.
[281:02.57]Is that a... shotgun?
[281:03.83]Uh, I'll take that.
[281:32.56]Oh fuck, he's shooting again.
[281:33.56]Oh my god, I don't know where he is.
[281:37.49]What direction is he shooting from?
[281:38.55]Alright, straight ahead.
[281:48.40]Oh my god, he's right there!
[281:49.38]Fuck, I just saw him.
[281:50.14]Okay.
[281:53.24]He's right there.
[282:05.44]Well, I can't fault Frank for wanting his revenge as I was there for the same damn reason myself.
[282:11.10]I don't know where to go.
[282:11.60]At this point, I'm guessing you think Silas Green is the worst murderer than Jim Reed ever was.
[282:17.33]No, sir.
[282:18.29]A man who spent half his life killing somebody's brothers, fathers, sons.
[282:24.13]I think you were just looking for justice.
[282:26.45]Is that what I was looking for, Dwight?
[282:29.19]God.
[282:29.31]Is that what it was?
[282:30.02]Justice?
[282:30.98]Justice?
[282:32.69]I think he's right... Is there... I don't... There's nothing I can hide behind.
[282:36.17]This rock right here is the only thing I can hide behind.
[282:37.75]Do you see anything else?
[282:42.55]Fuck.
[282:43.31]Uh, this is... What?
[282:51.98]The sky is falling.
[282:52.88]He hit me.
[283:01.60]There he is.
[283:02.00]Jeez.
[283:02.20]Ow.
[283:32.22]Can he hit me from here?
[283:32.82]Is that him?
[283:51.20]Give me the dynamite.
[283:53.94]That was throwing him off the cliff.
[283:56.78]I was trying to aim it, so... Oh, whatever.
[284:00.40]What a shitty hideout.
[284:01.72]Fuck you for having such a bad hideout.
[284:14.13]Yeah, go back to the three little pigs.
[284:16.53]Your house sucks.
[284:17.97]See, I grew wings and flew down there, and now here he is.
[284:49.96]I explained to Frank that I had nothing against him personally and that I was looking for someone else.
[284:55.02]You want Reed?
[284:56.40]Have at him.
[284:57.57]I never did like that bastard.
[284:59.73]I am done here.
[285:04.35]Bullshit, he's gonna pull a gun.
[285:05.45]We parted in peace as Frank pointed out the path to my prey before making his way back down the hill.
[285:23.55]That, that's... I'm trying to preemptively.
[285:26.53]He was going to shoot me or something.
[285:27.57]That's how it always happens.
[285:31.72]Now you're stuck in a time paradox.
[285:35.52]I'm sorry.
[285:37.84]We'll get out of it together.
[285:39.70]You and me.
[285:40.68]Just you and me.
[285:43.05]Yes, I'm talking to you.
[285:44.91]There are a lot of people here, but you're the one I'm talking to.
[285:50.61]Forget about all these other people here, you know?
[285:52.79]I was determined not to let that murderer escape my revenge again.
[286:20.04]Right in the leg.
[286:22.48]Drama.
[286:42.93]It was about that time, right?
[286:44.45]Of course it was.
[287:12.69]Fucked up the accuracy, but it's fine.
[287:37.67]Shit.
[287:38.31]Not good.
[287:45.97]Can I shoot through this?
[287:46.59]It's just wood, right?
[287:51.99]No, I can too.
[287:52.53]Ooh.
[287:58.89]Ooh.
[288:00.43]Whoa!
[288:36.49]Come on, bring it on.
[288:37.23]Here we go.
[288:44.59]Had waited a long time to face him down so I could repay him for what he did to my brothers Lightning
[289:20.53]It's a lot easier now, yeah.
[289:24.38]Oh well.
[289:26.32]No points?
[289:26.82]I got four out of five secrets?
[289:27.74]What?
[289:28.00]Pineapple reaction.
[289:35.02]He had pineapple reaction time.
[289:54.26]Back to Episode 7.
[289:56.30]The Wild Bunch.
[289:58.53]We're going back to the future again.
[290:00.13]This is the worst mission in the game.
[290:01.59]Oh, well.
[290:01.89]That's encouraging to hear.
[290:21.09]We'll see.
[290:26.01]The good, the bad, and the dead.
[290:36.11]Have fun with this one.
[290:37.21]He doesn't know.
[290:50.05]How close am I to the last weapon that I want to unlock?
[290:54.12]I'm pretty much there.
[290:55.88]So then we'll get the ivory-handled quick shooter.
[291:00.24]More damage and faster aiming speed.
[291:01.84]I'm going to try it at least once.
[291:12.83]Wow.
[291:14.55]That's it?
[291:15.83]There's no... Why would it not get... Usually you get to do like three or four of those.
[291:20.70]I just get to quick time event the one guy?
[291:22.54]All right.
[291:23.04]Why is that guy doing a backflip?
[291:26.96]I couldn't even be certain I could recognize him.
[291:29.92]By now he'd be close to 70.
[291:43.75]Got them all.
[291:44.07]There we go.
[291:44.51]There it is.
[291:44.89]I've re-handled Quick Shooter.
[291:47.31]I can't wait to try him.
[292:08.84]By this point in my storied career, I had killed more men than Bob Bryant ever had.
[292:15.42]I was furious as hell at that bastard for making me who I am.
[292:18.94]A man with no family, no friends, no purpose except shooting Bob Bryant dead.
[292:28.47]Bob Bryant.
[292:38.49]Oh.
[292:40.12]Well, it's one way to do that.
[292:41.96]Nugget?
[292:43.57]Oh, there's a nugget somewhere.
[292:46.25]There it is.
[292:46.99]Nope.
[292:48.51]Ooh, there it is.
[292:48.93]Okay.
[292:49.05]So these are the quick shooters.
[292:51.39]Those are fast.
[293:18.66]Very quick!
[293:19.98]Alright, nice.
[293:20.78]I'll use him.
[293:21.10]Let's head back down here.
[293:26.90]And out the door.
[293:34.70]Oh, I don't want any of those.
[293:35.76]At this point in the game, why do I even have boxes like this?
[293:39.34]I have upgraded better weapons.
[293:42.08]Every version, essentially.
[293:43.26]I gotta go up here.
[293:50.35]Why doesn't it want to go back up here?
[294:03.36]Uh...
[294:14.63]Hang over here.
[294:15.33]Okay.
[294:35.00]The stair- the stair's going up?
[294:36.58]Yeah, I mean, it wanted me to go in that building and go up here, but where the fuck was I supposed to go up to this?
[294:45.12]Where are the stairs?
[294:46.12]What the hell does he want me to do?
[295:02.25]Is he actually blind?
[295:03.49]No!
[295:03.73]Like, what?
[295:14.85]I did it.
[295:26.79]What?
[295:28.89]Okay.
[295:29.21]Secrets?
[295:49.94]Alright.
[295:59.61]Again, just one guy.
[296:01.11]Alright, you in here?
[296:02.27]What house are you in?
[296:25.20]Find Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
[296:29.26]Yeah.
[296:34.67]Even though the ghosts of my dead brothers were begging me to end what I started so long ago.
[296:40.41]Mr. Graves, are you alright?
[296:42.43]Would you like some water?
[296:44.67]The Wild Bunch knew I was there.
[296:47.78]They were after a treasure they had hidden before they fled.
[296:51.06]Buried in the grave of a dead amigo.
[296:54.37]Some folks think the town is haunted, so they figured there wouldn't be many people poking around.
[297:00.65]Nugget?
[297:01.09]I intended to fill that grave with Bob Bryant's corpse.
[297:05.16]What the fuck was that?
[297:06.28]Well, like I said, the bandits knew I was on to them.
[297:09.18]All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[297:11.20]I just want them.
[297:12.04]There's the secret.
[297:12.50]Hit me with everything they had.
[297:16.70]I'm just going to get collapsed up.
[297:26.26]Let's take the other guns.
[297:28.08]I feel like this is going to be more useful.
[297:46.11]He's up there.
[297:49.47]Five points!
[297:56.35]Wait, I'm dead?
[297:58.43]I'm supposed to be dead?
[298:26.43]Because when I woke up... From the dead?
[298:33.42]There was silence all around me.
[298:38.24]Dead the whole time.
[298:41.62]Find your way through ghost town.
[298:44.42]Billy who?
[298:45.72]Billy the kid.
[298:48.32]Can I walk out here?
[298:49.88]He was shooting at me from a rooftop.
[298:55.81]Nah, I don't want those.
[299:06.15]Can't open the door?
[299:06.73]Ghosts?
[299:26.03]Um, so.
[299:26.27]Hi.
[299:26.43]Guy that just appeared on my screen and killed me instantly.
[299:48.68]There's two Pat Garrets.
[299:50.20]Holy shit.
[300:26.59]Wait, and where is he again?
[300:34.15]He's throwing dynamite.
[300:36.33]What?
[300:40.39]I tried.
[300:43.99]Jesus.
[300:45.40]Hide.
[300:49.80]You can't even see him.
[300:57.00]I can barely see their ghost faces.
[300:59.14]What?
[301:12.91]You need to have that concentration bar filled for this.
[301:20.15]Oh, come on.
[301:26.94]How many Henry Flummers are there?
[301:30.04]Alright, I just crouch.
[301:36.34]Oh, come on.
[301:41.49]I'm going this way.
[301:44.27]No, I'm not.
[301:44.65]I can't go that way.
[301:55.73]There he is.
[302:01.02]Fuck!
[302:01.82]Which way?!
[302:12.70]Fuck.
[302:13.46]It's alright.
[302:22.93]Alright, nope.
[302:23.67]That's not how you do it.
[302:25.19]I thought maybe I could just run in there and just... No, that's not gonna happen.
[302:40.38]I gotta get cover somewhere here.
[302:41.88]He's gonna throw a dynamite at me.
[302:49.98]Alright, there's two down.
[302:52.45]The other one's over here.
[302:54.37]Alright, that's it.
[302:59.13]He's over here.
[303:24.38]I can see him a little bit.
[303:34.87]Let's lay a heal up.
[303:35.61]All right, I'm good.
[303:51.88]Any more people from your past?
[303:53.46]Any more boss rush people to deal with?
[304:02.89]I guess not.
[304:04.01]Hold on.
[304:04.35]There's a nugget here, right there.
[304:08.83]Alright, got them all.
[304:17.67]Please tell me this is a checkpoint.
[304:19.47]robert oliger appeared with his terrible double barrel shotgun holy he really did appear stormy was stopping me god he really did appear my father-in-law got hit with a fallen branch he spent the rest of his life talking to dogs
[304:48.84]What's left?
[304:49.34]Oh God.
[304:51.03]Okay.
[304:51.71]Up there?
[304:51.95]Fuck!
[304:54.45]Fuck!
[305:18.98]Where?
[305:19.92]Up here still?
[305:21.50]Over here.
[305:24.38]Oh god, tree!
[305:25.52]Save me!
[305:27.39]Jesus!
[305:28.47]Where the fuck?
[305:37.08]Oh my goodness gracious.
[305:46.51]Alright, I gotta save.
[305:49.58]Alright, hide behind a tombstone or something.
[306:09.46]I'm going away from the story.
[306:10.66]How?
[306:12.12]They're all down there.
[306:14.61]Here we go.
[306:20.65]Wow.
[306:30.24]God!
[306:33.24]God dammit, he's still alive!
[306:55.50]Okay.
[306:56.92]Dude, I gotta hide behind the house or something.
[307:01.56]I can't go that way.
[307:03.43]Fuck.
[307:04.27]No.
[307:15.32]Where are you?
[307:16.06]It's the last one.
[307:26.55]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[307:28.38]I'm dead.
[307:30.60]I...
[307:58.06]This is insta- oh no.
[308:01.34]I- You gotta be kidding me.
[308:09.95]And okay, here's another dumb thing.
[308:13.93]If you walk too far, you restart the whole level.
[308:20.97]How big is this area?
[308:24.73]Oh, this sucks ass.
[308:26.69]Alright, well... How the fuck am I ever gonna beat this?
[308:34.02]I'm not gonna use... I'm gonna try to hold this.
[308:51.43]I say that now.
[308:52.03]They just spray a thousand bullets.
[308:53.97]And look, I'm going too far from the story.
[308:55.69]Time to restart the level.
[309:15.73]Jesse, Woodson, James, and Jim Reed.
[309:18.77]Each one deader than the next.
[309:23.22]Fast shotgun reload.
[309:24.44]No, what can help me here?
[309:28.60]Faster revolver reload, maybe.
[309:30.94]Probably the faster reload.
[309:59.53]Is somebody behind me too?
[310:01.97]I have no idea.
[310:03.54]This guy is next to me.
[310:06.32]Somehow this dude got next to me.
[310:16.79]The Dalton brothers.
[310:18.13]Robert and Grattan.
[310:19.53]Guardians of the Garden of the Dead.
[310:28.50]Uh, this gun's not good for this.
[310:33.41]I think I gotta stay with the pistols.
[310:35.93]This takes too long to kill anything.
[310:37.50]Even with headshots.
[310:38.10]They're all over here.
[311:03.56]Jesse, Woodson, James, and Jim Reed.
[311:06.56]Each one deader than the next.
[311:09.72]I thought I would go crazy.
[311:16.47]They're fucking everywhere!
[311:28.02]Mike, come on!
[311:42.01]What?
[311:42.25]What?
[311:42.43]Why do you have that much health?
[311:44.81]Why do you have that much health?
[311:48.23]I don't know what to do.
[312:10.82]Oh my fucking god.
[312:18.71]Where is he?
[312:19.09]Which one?
[312:19.77]Left or right?
[312:20.25]Ooh!
[312:32.67]Somebody said the Undertaker.
[312:45.03]He just baited me so hard.
[312:48.79]Holy fuck, man.
[312:49.75]You gotta be kidding me.
[313:10.40]No!
[313:11.26]Tombstone save!
[313:22.03]Don't do it.
[313:28.18]Holy fuck, man.
[313:33.46]No!
[313:34.10]Which way?
[314:07.52]Holy fuck, Jesus Christ, that was insane.
[314:09.40]That was fucking crazy.
[314:11.42]I didn't think I was gonna beat that.
[314:14.28]Fuck.
[314:14.52]Butch Cassidy.
[314:38.25]Sundance Kid.
[314:40.96]The good, the bad, and the dead.
[314:42.84]And Silas Greaves.
[314:44.30]We're gonna do a three-way duel?
[314:49.54]Thank God I had those improved guns.
[315:08.30]I was hoping I wouldn't have to kill you.
[315:11.14]You won't have to, Butch.
[315:13.20]I'm killing you first.
[315:14.33]I asked them about Bob Bryant, but they were too busy with their own heated conversation.
[315:24.25]Let me get this shit straight.
[315:25.99]You want my money and the love of my life?
[315:29.53]You've figured it all away, Butch.
[315:32.13]Etta's mine.
[315:33.59]So is that damn money.
[315:36.32]I didn't want to shoot anybody until I had an answer to my question.
[315:40.09]But those boys didn't give me much of a choice.
[315:43.23]Wait, what?
[315:43.85]I'm going to interfere in their game?
[315:48.14]Use Q and E to switch your focus to the enemy who's looking at you.
[315:53.90]Are you serious?
[315:58.35]Wait, I have to...
[316:13.82]Who makes the first move?
[316:40.67]Damn.
[316:41.19]Alright, so he's looking at me now, right?
[316:51.32]SCP Cassidy.
[316:58.76]Whoops.
[316:59.72]Bad speed.
[317:00.36]This is going to be fucking... It's botched already.
[317:04.34]Oh, this is looking all botched.
[317:05.24]This is already... I fucked this whole thing up.
[317:08.03]There's no way I'm going to do this.
[317:09.93]This is going to be a fucking Christmas miracle if this goes through. 8%.
[317:30.38]Why was it mice Look at me look at me Look at me, please
[318:03.52]This is the one.
[318:15.65]It was kind of anti-climactic, but it's alright.
[318:19.92]I'll take... at least it's over 50%.
[318:36.31]It is 50%, so I'm okay with that.
[318:39.39]Never under 50.
[318:39.97]At least no 49s, no 38s.
[318:58.94]It's the finale.
[319:04.75]Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were killed by the Bolivian Army.
[319:09.12]Everybody knows that.
[319:10.52]That's the legend, but it ain't the truth.
[319:13.68]So, you never found Bob?
[319:16.08]There is no Bob.
[319:17.66]This old sumbitch ain't even Silas Greaves.
[319:22.09]Sir, is that true?
[319:24.21]Have you been pulling our legs this whole time?
[319:27.61]Not the whole time.
[319:29.55]Oh, man, I think you've worn out your welcome here.
[319:32.77]Maybe you're right, Jack.
[319:34.77]Maybe it's time to pay.
[319:38.16]You see, Ben, or should I say Bob, your past always catches up with you.
[319:49.15]I found him.
[319:49.65]Choose your destiny.
[319:50.25]Revenge?
[319:50.51]Redemption.
[319:50.89]Hmm.
[320:23.52]I think we got a... two different endings.
[320:38.78]Revenge is kill.
[320:40.08]Redemption is no kill.
[320:54.04]I'm thinking redemption here.
[321:05.92]But then there's also kill him.
[321:09.70]You killed everyone in your path, why stop now?
[321:12.14]Yeah, I get to the goal and I say, alright, I'm done.
[321:22.88]Uh...
[321:24.75]one more the um why'd you toy with me like that telling those tales knowing all along why not just lay your cards on the table wanted to suss you out bob see what kind of man you turned out to be maybe prod you into drawing on me see all those years on your trail turned me into a killer
[321:53.99]We've been killing so much.
[321:55.23]We need to see what happens.
[321:56.54]Dwight Eisenhower!
[322:22.75]We got the Dwight Eisenhower reveal on Redemption.
[322:24.93]Didn't get that on Revenge.
[322:26.17]Yes, sir.
[322:49.34]I won't have it said I left you with nothing, Bob.
[323:34.73]Okay.
[323:38.26]Now we can see the other ending.
[324:00.39]Alter the timeline.
[324:01.03]Let's see how it ends the other way.
[324:08.38]I knew it was gonna work as long as I didn't get to the loading screen.
[324:12.46]See what happens with revenge.
[324:16.37]No, I chose redemption.
[324:17.57]That's my choice.
[324:18.33]That's my ending.
[324:19.73]But... Let's see what happens on the other side.
[324:23.62]This is my choice.
[324:24.72]But... We're peering into the eyes of other gamers, you know?
[324:36.94]Why'd you toil with me like that?
[324:38.66]Telling those tales, knowing all along.
[324:41.28]Why not just lay your cards on the table?
[324:43.89]Here.
[324:45.61]I won't have it said that I left you with nothing.
[324:52.81]That's how you want it?
[324:54.97]So be it.
[325:00.74]Holy shit!
[325:01.88]All right, Molly, move against that wall.
[325:03.54]Go!
[325:07.34]We actually get to play.
[325:08.40]There's more gameplay with this ending.
[325:16.60]There's no indicators either.
[325:17.58]I'm not gonna blow it.
[325:33.12]He's dead.
[325:41.04]Did you know it was him all along?
[325:45.22]Cassidy told me Bob was in Abilene before he died.
[325:49.26]But I wasn't sure Ben was my man until he revealed how much he knew about Ringo and Reed.
[325:55.06]The coin, of course.
[325:56.64]Well, that was the last nail in that particular coffin.
[326:00.96]I better go get the sheriff.
[326:02.89]You okay, boy?
[326:04.23]You look a mite shook up.
[326:05.55]Dwight, maybe you best go home.
[326:07.47]See, we're never going to know who he is.
[326:08.81]Oh.
[326:08.97]Never mind.
[326:10.01]He shouldn't get caught up in something like this.
[326:14.19]They tell you anyway.
[326:15.39]I think I might head out myself at this juncture.
[326:19.08]Unless you want to stop me, Jack.
[326:22.16]No, sir.
[326:23.26]Mr. Graves.
[326:24.56]So where are you going now?
[326:26.78]Now that you had your revenge.
[326:29.58]Doesn't really matter, does it?
[326:32.74]I heard that.
[326:35.38]There's a giant fucking gorilla that can talk.
[326:41.53]He's getting the whole team back together.
[327:01.88]There it is.
[327:17.05]That's a short little bite-sized game.
[327:20.29]There are other game modes too, we'll try them out.
[327:27.24]That was fun.
[327:29.44]Challenging.
[327:31.46]I'm actually glad I played that on hard.
[327:35.74]There's another difficulty after that.
[327:41.36]Just a fun, short little game.
[327:47.83]I want to try the dual game mode and see how that's different.
[327:52.69]What's my rating?
[327:58.48]It was like an 8.7.
[327:59.56]It was like an 8.6, 8.7 until I got to that last encounter, which made it like an 8.2.
[328:15.35]It's always an 8.7.
[328:16.81]Yeah, it is.
[328:19.67]8.6.
[328:20.23]That was an 8.6, 8.5.
[328:21.23]No, it was good.
[328:35.32]It was solid.
[328:35.88]I don't think that was the best video game I've ever played in my life, but I would recommend you play it.
[328:41.27]It was fun.
[328:51.08]It's somewhere in that, like, 7 to 8, I'd say, out of 10, depending on who you are.
[329:03.81]It doesn't need to be any higher.
[329:04.87]It's just an arcade shooter with some fun mechanics.
[329:15.58]I think I should be able just to go, right?
[329:17.36]Nothing after the credits.
[329:19.95]New modes are available and New Game Plus is now available.
[329:22.39]Start a new story retaining all the unlocked skills and weapons.
[329:25.47]True West difficulty is now available.
[329:27.34]Try going through the story with minimal HUD and extra difficulty to get the real Western experience.
[329:35.96]Alright, Arcade.
[329:36.76]What's Arcade?
[329:39.28]Position.
[329:42.88]I guess you have, like, positions with people.
[329:45.14]What's Lincoln County?
[329:51.24]Arcade, Lincoln County.
[329:59.30]So it's just score runs of the level?
[330:01.84]Anything different in it, or it's just... Welcome to Arcade mode.
[330:06.97]It's all about the high scores.
[330:08.01]You get points for kills and awards.
[330:10.45]But the key to success is linking kills together into combos.
[330:13.51]You have to finish the mission alive to keep your score.
[330:16.24]Get it done quickly.
[330:18.56]Gunslinger, Trapper, Ranger...
[330:23.12]Okay.
[330:25.50]Start game.
[330:32.78]Each kill raises the combo by one.
[330:34.42]Alright, well, I can't hit anything.
[330:40.89]Apparently, why can't I... Bad!
[330:44.61]Kill under the enemy... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[330:52.75]This is not gonna be a great score.
[330:54.17]Like, what?
[331:02.11]Okay, but... Did you see that?
[331:05.09]Somebody has to look... Did you see what just happened?
[331:10.37]I did... That's... It's not me.
[331:16.37]I did it three more times!
[331:18.06]Did I shoot... Restart.
[332:06.26]Come on, somebody!
[332:07.16]Anybody!
[332:07.46]Ah.
[332:08.50]I'm getting C over here.
[332:18.34]He's being blocked.
[332:41.55]Come on, somebody!
[332:42.83]Damn it.
[333:07.12]Ooh, I'll take it.
[333:23.28]Oh no, they shot Bill.
[333:25.06]Poor Bill.
[333:28.06]He was a good guy.
[333:28.96]Oh fuck, didn't even know he was there.
[333:56.37]I can't believe you're still alive.
[333:58.74]Alright, clean it up here.
[333:59.92]That was bad.
[334:32.56]That's it?
[334:33.64]Okay.
[334:37.50]That's it.
[334:37.80]That's really fun.
[334:38.34]If you can get the whole route down, it'd be kind of cool.
[334:52.65]So, to be able to get a... Alright, I get it.
[334:54.23]I understand.
[334:56.03]So, you really need to get a route down.
[335:00.85]unlock the skills and replay them.
[335:05.09]One star?
[335:05.49]Yeah, it's designed for you to get one star and then you replay it like 50 times and you do much better every time.
[335:14.83]That's cool.
[335:19.91]What about the duels?
[335:20.45]Let me see what the duels do.
[335:24.62]What a real pineapple response that was.
[335:33.10]Duel Challenge.
[335:43.63]Win a series of showdowns honorably and quickly to become a true legend of the Wild West.
[335:47.68]You have five lives to try it again just in case you get shot along the way.
[336:06.59]I'm not very good at these.
[336:13.33]But I'll try.
[336:13.81]2,000, right?
[336:26.06]15 stages!
[336:28.30]Oh, God.
[336:28.82]You're gonna do all 15 people in the story?
[336:34.75]Remember the Peter Griffin joke I made?
[336:36.67]Make it again.
[336:37.25]Somebody in chat do it.
[336:38.05]I'm gonna... I'm gonna lose at the last level, probably.
[337:07.56]Honorable.
[337:08.78]Lives left.
[337:10.29]Continue.
[337:15.09]I remember this guy.
[337:16.29]Oh, yeah, I do.
[337:19.23]Old man Clanton.
[337:30.00]Oh, shit.
[337:31.00]You're going way too far off camera here.
[337:38.54]Fuck!
[337:39.10]The cross... The crosshair was on him too.
[337:42.45]Damn it.
[337:45.63]He took like so many steps to his left.
[337:53.97]Somebody told me that this with the controller is like 30 times easier, but I don't have one here plugged in.
[338:12.29]Got him.
[338:12.67]Alright.
[338:18.11]Controller is for scrubs.
[338:27.16]This is still fun, though.
[338:28.02]I wish... Another one of my wishes.
[338:30.48]Where's my gamer genie?
[338:31.66]Where's my game genie?
[338:33.58]For me to plug these things in.
[338:37.45]So Red Dead came out, right?
[338:38.99]Red Dead Redemption 2.
[338:41.11]And there was... The duels weren't... They weren't that elaborate.
[338:46.01]It was kind of just... I want a game like this.
[338:50.21]Where... Alright, I'm just like talking.
[338:52.27]You know, a game where the intensity of a duel is there.
[339:04.08]Different mechanics, breathing, reaction times.
[339:11.62]Those old, even those games we played on the Wii.
[339:14.18]Those old arcade cabinet games.
[339:16.36]Mad Dog McCree and shit.
[339:17.42]Like, I wish somebody would make one of those.
[339:24.67]Just make the whole game about this.
[339:26.03]And even do multiplayer.
[339:27.83]I mean, you'd have to have pretty good netcode, but still.
[339:41.43]It's two in each.
[339:43.68]Yeah, but people have said that about other stuff before.
[339:45.94]And they became fairly popular games, right?
[339:52.17]Why don't I just shoot the... Yeah, why would I... Just shoot the barrel.
[340:11.55]I'm too busy focusing 100% on the barrel, and there is a distraction.
[340:17.16]It's just a distraction.
[340:42.10]I dodged it.
[340:48.25]Yeah, he's too fast.
[340:58.29]John Harden!
[341:06.07]Now I need that speed.
[341:09.99]I wanna almost press my eyeballs to the screen.
[341:13.53]Can I, like, push one eye on this left side?
[341:16.37]I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[341:22.00]I have to go, like, frog-eyed.
[341:25.86]I can't see them both at the same time.
[341:47.56]Oh.
[341:47.72]Airblade Bushido Blade.
[341:58.02]Um, that name's really familiar.
[341:59.42]Bushido Blade.
[342:07.60]Bushido Blade.
[342:10.92]It's got a very familiar name.
[342:24.37]I got this one.
[342:29.45]It's an old PS1 game, one hit and you die.
[342:33.99]Is that the game with a bunch of different weapons?
[342:37.25]It's almost like a 3D fighter, where you fight one person at a time.
[342:47.45]Maybe we'll give it a try.
[342:50.56]I vaguely remember playing that game.
[343:00.30]Not good speed so far.
[343:01.38]I might be able to still do it.
[343:05.26]We're good.
[343:16.09]It's got a cool story mode where you have to fight honorably to get the best ending.
[343:18.71]That's actually really awesome.
[343:29.33]Just get Bushido Blade 2 if you do.
[343:32.74]Is that one of those cases like Monster Rancher where the second one is just better?
[343:36.86]It's just a better version of the first one?
[343:44.50]Yeah?
[343:44.98]Okay.
[344:11.99]Got them both.
[344:15.83]You just get both for a decent price.
[344:19.10]PlayStation 1 games are weird, though.
[344:20.68]Some of these old games that you would think, eh, it's probably like $5.
[344:24.10]Some of them are like $50 to $100.
[344:28.16]But if it's worth it, it's worth it, right?
[344:31.06]I like playing on original hardware.
[344:32.31]You know that's a meme on this channel, but it's true.
[344:48.99]Oh, fuck!
[344:50.01]No!
[344:50.59]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[344:52.14]I, like, my... I have, like, a greasy hand right now.
[344:57.04]I have, like, a fucking watery hand.
[344:59.78]And it just, like, accidentally slipped.
[345:09.25]Ah, I'll get close.
[345:10.39]I don't know if I'll get all the way to the end, though.
[345:12.59]This is already looking bad.
[345:21.72]Damn it, man.
[345:22.43]That's fucking fast.
[345:26.47]Well, this is it.
[345:57.33]100% speed.
[346:04.60]I just have to do four more and not miss any shots.
[346:08.65]Only four more.
[346:41.50]That's it.
[346:48.96]New high score.
[346:50.36]Died on Jim Reed.
[346:52.08]I could see getting, like, addicted to that for at least a little while.
[347:02.71]That's cool.
[347:06.17]New game plus.
[347:07.53]What does recollections mean?
[347:12.15]Oh, I see.
[347:12.69]It's the movies, the... that's cool.
[347:17.55]PvP would be neat.
[347:18.48]Yeah, it would.
[347:25.58]Wait, what am I saying?
[347:28.96]Recollections?
[347:29.70]Recollections.
[347:31.26]Recollections.
[347:35.54]Like a 100,000 IQ streamer, right?
[347:44.35]But I think that's a solid place to call it for tonight.
[347:49.19]Just six hours.
[347:51.48]I think that's a pretty decent place to call it.
[347:54.24]I don't really want to get anything else started.
[348:02.39]We'll do the bits.
[348:02.89]We'll hang out for a little bit.
[348:03.69]Should be probably like six, six and a half.
[348:06.37]And then tomorrow, for those of you that, you know, you've been around, you already know this, but the reason why I'm going four days in a row, I don't typically do more than three or four days in a row, but I'm not going to be around this next week.
[348:26.56]My mother is coming up.
[348:28.20]We're going to spend a bunch of time together.
[348:29.46]I haven't seen her in a long time, so I'm going to take about five days off.
[348:35.78]Because that's when she'll be here, and I want to spend time with my mom.
[348:38.64]So I'm taking a little vacation.
[348:41.28]I'll be back.
[348:46.00]Because when she's gone, I'm probably going to see her one more time.
[348:53.21]And then I'm obviously not going to see her for like probably another six months, a year, whenever we do something else together as like a family, right?
[349:01.13]So I do want to spend some time with my mother.
[349:04.23]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[349:05.97]Tomorrow we're going to do... We'll probably... Oh, by the way, tomorrow I'm starting at like 6 plus p.m.
[349:16.50]Pacific.
[349:17.54]I have an appointment tomorrow.
[349:20.60]So I have to do, I'm going to the dentist.
[349:23.34]So I gotta do that in the early afternoon, and then we're just gonna hang out for like a few hours.
[349:29.18]Maybe a little bit more.
[349:29.90]I might play the first episode of Sam & Max.
[349:33.97]We'll hang out.
[349:34.85]There's a couple videos that I want to watch.
[349:38.01]So tomorrow, there's no plan at all tomorrow.
[349:41.87]I just wanted to go live again, because I'm not gonna be live for a long time, so...
[349:47.73]I wanna put the time in for you guys, I wanna see you guys.
[349:49.95]I'm not gonna see you for a while.
[349:54.09]So, we're just going in completely no plan tomorrow.
[349:57.30]Should be fun.
[350:02.72]I got good dental.
[350:07.42]Please play more Telltale games, we'll see.
[350:10.63]Has my mom ever seen what I do for a living?
[350:12.61]Yeah.
[350:14.87]She knows.
[350:16.41]Oh, yeah.
[350:17.67]She's very well aware.
[350:24.27]But thanks for watching tonight.
[350:28.23]I hope you enjoyed.
[350:28.99]I wanted just to kind of chill, relax, and play a game that I've wanted to play for a while.
[350:36.03]So we just kind of hung out and played Gunslinger.
[350:39.13]And it was great.
[350:39.83]It was a real comfy stream today.
[350:43.30]I liked it.
[350:46.91]Kind of needed this after the insanity of the last week or two.
[350:56.90]But let's get to the bits.
[350:59.10]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[351:00.58]Late afternoon, somewhere around like 6 o'clock Pacific.
[351:04.07]Depending.
[351:04.55]I don't really have an exact time because I don't know how long I'm going to be at this appointment for.
[351:12.61]But regardless, I'll see you.
[351:13.43]If you're going to come hang out tomorrow, we'll see you tomorrow.
[351:18.87]Does my mother watch the streams?
[351:20.29]No.
[351:23.03]I think it's one of those cases where she's like, I know what you do, and it's great, but she's not going to sit here and watch.
[351:32.81]My mother's very supportive.
[351:33.87]She's great.
[351:35.31]She really is.
[351:37.49]And I can't wait to see her.
[351:39.19]I'm excited.
[351:39.61]She'll be here real soon.
[351:43.17]But let's go back.
[351:44.95]Earlier this afternoon.
[351:47.85]to, uh, Afro Ninja, thanks for the five dollars.
[351:51.52]Thank you.
[351:53.22]Thank you Zorro Carlos for the 250.
[351:54.76]The title of this game sounds like a Family Guy cutaway joke about some, uh, Mexican Call of Duty knockoff.
[352:05.29]A Family Guy cutaway joke.
[352:12.97]And I made a Family Guy reference.
[352:14.29]That, he did have the green pants, the white button-up, and he was like, had a fat stomach.
[352:21.18]That's just the Peter Griffin.
[352:23.24]It is.
[352:24.68]I'm sorry.
[352:32.03]Thank you, Some Guy, for the $15.
[352:34.89]It's been a long time since I posted a meme video.
[352:38.77]Hopefully, a meme video last and hopefully, and honestly, sorry.
[352:45.16]I still don't have a good video to show you.
[352:47.56]But anyway, here's Shark Tale for three minutes.
[352:54.04]I don't want to watch Shark Tale.
[352:58.89]This is Shark Tale times 31 speed.
[353:11.91]Somebody had to upload this.
[353:18.45]Is this some weird fucked up way to get around the YouTube algorithm to catch content ID?
[353:24.18]Do you download this video and then undo the x31 speed?
[353:34.16]Is that how that works?
[353:37.62]Do you slow it down until you can comprehend it?
[353:43.19]Well, thank you for the $15, first of all, some guy.
[353:45.86]And thanks for the whole entire shark tail.
[353:51.04]It's a three-minute video.
[353:53.74]It's the whole movie, I guess.
[353:57.63]Thank you.
[353:58.03]I appreciate it.
[354:09.24]Thank you, Spicy Pepe's, for $5.00.
[354:12.78]Hey Jerma, I hope you're doing well.
[354:13.92]Just wanted to say that I really appreciate you and all that you do on these streams.
[354:17.72]Been watching you a couple years now, and every time I click on an old YouTube video or hop into one of your streams, I know I'll be laughing throughout it all.
[354:24.08]I think you're the most genuine and caring human on the planet, and you're the best.
[354:29.87]Thank you for the $5 spicy pepes, and thank you for an incredibly kind fucking message.
[354:37.79]That's... Thank you.
[354:46.43]There's a lot of things that I'm glad you think of this community in these streams.
[354:52.98]So, thank you so much.
[354:54.56]I really appreciate it.
[355:00.71]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the 250.
[355:02.27]Johnny test whip crack.
[355:06.83]Is that a sound effect?
[355:11.53]Uh, Atrolux Atrix, thanks for the three bucks.
[355:13.65]Hey, Jerma, can you pretend this is a $50?
[355:14.99]I remember that.
[355:16.17]That was from earlier.
[355:17.47]That was Atrolux.
[355:21.13]That really confused me so much.
[355:24.90]And then Atrolux again gave $250.
[355:26.00]Alright, I didn't expect that.
[355:27.80]Thanks, Jerma.
[355:28.34]That was accidental comedy.
[355:33.10]Can you pretend this is $50?
[355:34.26]Ugh.
[355:43.92]Thank you, cadbtv, resident game developer here.
[355:49.30]Thanks for the 250.
[355:50.18]Hey Jerma, I've never played this game before.
[355:52.24]Is the objective to shoot the buildings?
[355:53.94]You're doing great.
[356:00.00]50 plus percent every time.
[356:02.93]Some of those levels were 75, 71%.
[356:06.03]That means seven out of every 10 shots landed into somebody.
[356:11.21]Come on, on hard mode too?
[356:13.89]That's not bad, that's fine.
[356:15.37]What's wrong with that?
[356:17.11]There's nothing wrong with that!
[356:20.71]Why is it, that's like, good.
[356:23.21]That's good.
[356:24.25]It is.
[356:25.57]I'm gonna toot my horn here, because there is no horn to toot.
[356:28.59]That's good.
[356:29.15]60-70% accuracy on hard mode in the game, that's fine.
[356:35.21]That's fine, you don't have to worry.
[356:36.83]What do I have to worry about?
[356:41.76]Give us closure on if you're gonna play God Hand or not.
[356:45.32]I don't know.
[356:46.06]I don't know what I'm gonna have for breakfast tomorrow.
[356:51.42]Are you saying that you missed 25% of the buildings you were shooting at?
[356:56.78]Let's just say yes, I guess.
[357:08.07]You guys, man.
[357:08.89]Sometimes you guys are fucking crazy.
[357:12.07]Oh, I love it.
[357:14.55]Thank you, an anonymous cheerer, for the ten dollars, ten... Sometimes words explode inside my brain and they run into each other.
[357:24.03]A thousand bits from an anonymous cheerer.
[357:26.09]Ten bucks.
[357:28.99]Thank you, whoever you are.
[357:32.70]Whoever you are.
[357:34.60]And then we had a bunch of community subs.
[357:35.78]Jerma's Average Dong gave a bunch.
[357:37.64]Pixel Mike gave a bunch.
[357:41.74]Lots and lots of community subs given a couple hours ago.
[357:44.88]Thank you, guys.
[357:47.00]Chunky Baloney, thanks for the $5.
[357:48.44]Buy yourself some double cheeseburgers on me.
[357:52.00]I really want a crispy, thin crust pepperoni pizza right now.
[357:55.18]We were talking about it earlier.
[358:02.21]I'm just super, like, I'm relaxed.
[358:07.45]Anybody else just totally relaxed right now?
[358:12.88]I'm just going to eat some pizza and just sit on the couch and just... I can't wait.
[358:21.75]Quick, somebody stress him out.
[358:22.77]Don't do that.
[358:23.97]I'm in a great spot right now.
[358:25.65]What do you mean stress him out?
[358:28.85]I'm frustrated with you.
[358:29.93]Why?
[358:30.19]What?
[358:30.51]Why?
[358:30.85]What are you talking about?
[358:32.52]We're just relaxing.
[358:35.66]Everyone's trying to stress me out.
[358:44.52]Don't mess with my vibe, dude.
[358:56.36]Everybody thinks you're an idiot.
[358:58.60]No, they don't.
[358:59.13]That's a joke.
[359:01.77]It's a meme on the channel.
[359:03.11]I made it up, I said.
[359:04.11]I went, I am dumb!
[359:06.65]Like four years ago, and everybody just doesn't know.
[359:09.57]It's a meme on the channel.
[359:10.45]It's a joke.
[359:10.97]Every time anybody says it, it's a funny thing that we do.
[359:19.64]Yeah, I made that up four years ago.
[359:22.78]And I said, it's going to be wicked funny.
[359:24.84]Because everyone's going to keep saying this.
[359:26.56]And I want this to be a thing on the channel.
[359:28.24]Like, guys, dumb.
[359:31.13]And people still do it now.
[359:32.03]I'm surprised.
[359:32.61]It's cool to see that the streamer's dumb joke that I made that I told you guys that was funny to do.
[359:41.57]You guys still do it.
[359:42.23]It's great.
[359:42.75]I think it's fun.
[359:57.24]He's deflecting.
[360:00.16]Yeah, oh wouldn't you?
[360:02.68]If a stranger walked up to you and said, hey, hey dude, you're dumb.
[360:06.90]What would you do?
[360:09.94]But first of all, you were like trying to get into the sewer.
[360:13.77]Right?
[360:14.91]You were trying to like get into the sewer with your bare hands.
[360:20.09]But still, like let me do me, right?
[360:21.67]Like, would you go up to that guy and be like, hey dude, you're dumb.
[360:24.31]No, he's just trying to get in the sewer, whatever.
[360:31.38]Okay, if a guy was just, like, yelling about Pop-Tarts or something on the sidewalk, would you walk up to him and go, hey, dude, you're stupid?
[360:37.80]No, you wouldn't.
[360:38.32]You would be like, oh, that guy's just kind of weird.
[360:40.22]Let him do what he's gonna do.
[360:46.37]You wouldn't do that.
[360:48.47]You wouldn't download a car.
[360:52.19]Okay.
[361:01.83]Thank you to... Where are we here?
[361:03.57]Germa's Average Dong.
[361:06.50]No, that's Germa's... There's so many Germa's name something.
[361:09.56]Germa lied about Minecraft.
[361:10.90]Germa's dick.
[361:11.60]Germa's dong.
[361:12.52]Germa lied about Fruity Loops.
[361:24.20]Thank you, Germa lied about Minecraft VR for the five community subs right now.
[361:30.67]Maybe I should stop lying.
[361:32.69]Half of these are not even about lying.
[361:33.99]They're about my, like, penis.
[361:35.29]What do you mean, lying?
[361:46.84]What's that have to do with me telling anything?
[361:51.76]Liar.
[361:53.12]Oh my god.
[361:55.11]But thank you to Smelly Boy for the $2.50.
[361:57.21]This game is so cool.
[361:59.05]It was very cool.
[362:00.73]I liked it.
[362:03.45]Thank you Have Gun for the $2.50.
[362:05.57]Hey, German, did you notice that all the level names are the names of Western movies?
[362:09.26]Just altered a little bit.
[362:10.48]I didn't even pick that up.
[362:11.88]That's cool.
[362:18.34]I guess the good, the bad, and the... Yeah, I could see that.
[362:24.38]That's very cool.
[362:32.48]Thank you, Castlion, or Castlion, for the $5.
[362:37.51]Just paying you back for spamming your chat with history facts about the guys you killed.
[362:47.83]That's fucking funny.
[362:52.47]I'm surprised you didn't get, like, timed out.
[362:59.51]That's cool, though.
[363:04.81]Knowledge with our games, right?
[363:13.56]Mods were nice to me.
[363:14.58]Well, that's good.
[363:18.50]But thank you for the $5, and thanks for the history.
[363:22.70]Thank you.
[363:30.68]Thank you, Pretty Support, for the five dollars.
[363:33.04]Sleep tight, streamer.
[363:35.16]I'll try.
[363:35.52]I will try.
[363:46.91]Sleeping, I told you, my biggest... My biggest superpower that I wish I had was... Being able to go like this and go to bed.
[363:54.93]Although that would be not good, because if anybody... If you snapped for some reason, you'd just fall asleep.
[364:05.04]Sometimes that would- it would be good but it wouldn't. It would have to be something very specific.
[364:09.04]It'd have to be like snap three times in a row and then like say a series of words.
[364:13.50]I remember reading uh- there was a thing on reddit before about what would your superpower be or- or if you if everybody had the same superpower or something whatever it was.
[364:24.50]Somebody said that like the only way that they would make it so I could fly or if everybody could have the same superpower but you could add something to it or something.
[364:34.07]And one of the comments said something like, I would make it so everybody had the ability to fly, but I only knew that it took this insane regimen of things to do before it worked.
[364:47.12]You know what I'm talking about.
[364:56.12]Produce an infinite amount of spaghetti sauce.
[364:57.88]I don't know about infinite.
[365:07.21]Nice joke.
[365:07.67]That wasn't it.
[365:08.73]I'm not making a joke.
[365:09.63]It was a thing with... I can't even remember it.
[365:12.47]I shouldn't have even started talking about it, because I don't even remember it.
[365:14.85]I remember it was something like that, though, where you choose a superpower, but everybody gets to have it.
[365:21.54]Just type in superpower everybody gets to have it reddit, and you'll find the cool comment that that guy put.
[365:31.64]But let me get the credits up.
[365:33.41]We have a couple more bits left.
[365:37.32]Let's see those community subs fly on by.
[365:40.26]What do you say?
[365:43.82]Thank you, Devakitty, for the three dollars.
[365:47.02]I gotta go on a six-hour train ride twice in one day to get hormone treatment because I made the journey here two weeks ago, but only when I got to the hospital they told me my appointment was cancelled.
[365:58.54]So I returned home feeling very defeated and your streams helped me through a tough break.
[366:03.77]Thank you for being such a good streamer.
[366:05.75]They say transgender pride.
[366:08.56]I'm sorry to hear that that didn't go well.
[366:14.50]Back and forth, that sucks.
[366:24.07]Thank you for being here.
[366:30.21]Sorry that didn't go well, but there's another day, right?
[366:40.05]Glad to have a spot where people can just hang out and have fun.
[366:46.78]It's the only thing I fucking care about, so... Fun!
[366:53.76]I'm glad people can have it here.
[367:01.83]Whoa, whoops.
[367:04.59]Feed me ads.
[367:10.41]I'm gonna do two adds, just wait.
[367:15.53]Cheer 500.
[367:16.48]God damn it, I fucked it up.
[367:17.60]Play Oblivion again.
[367:20.20]Why did that work?
[367:22.84]It just, it did.
[367:23.68]Hey, PikaBanana, thanks for the 250.
[367:28.50]Did I just say German Heart?
[367:30.89]Thank you.
[367:33.98]If you're gonna play Sam & Max tomorrow and you're starting with episode one, don't get the wrong impression.
[367:36.92]It starts off slow because there's six episodes and it gets way better.
[367:40.90]Well, whatever.
[367:43.72]That's fine.
[367:47.05]I'm only gonna... I'll do the first episode, alright?
[367:51.55]We'll have like four, probably like three to five hours to kill.
[368:01.74]So we'll have plenty of time to do at least one.
[368:10.04]Play all three?
[368:10.82]There are three different games?
[368:14.34]Of Sam and Max?
[368:18.75]Bingo, Sunshine, $5.
[368:20.27]Good to my word.
[368:21.25]Play Oblivion, though.
[368:24.95]You didn't have to do that.
[368:25.99]It's alright.
[368:26.83]Thank you, Phil.
[368:32.18]Look at all these fucking subs rolling by.
[368:34.96]Can you play every game ever?
[368:37.05]Well, I will get in there.
[368:39.57]I've played a lot of the old ones.
[368:48.14]But thank y'all.
[368:49.46]I'll see you tomorrow.
[368:52.52]We're gonna do... It's... There is no plan.
[368:57.98]I might just do like a little bit of Sam and Max.
[369:00.42]I might watch a few videos.
[369:03.60]And then we might just do fucking chat roulette.
[369:07.48]You know what I mean?
[369:09.22]What game am I going to play?
[369:10.68]Whatever it is.
[369:12.85]Try this one.
[369:13.47]Okay, maybe we'll play for like an hour.
[369:29.60]VR chat on open.
[369:31.84]I don't know about that.
[369:35.68]That doesn't mean what you think it means.
[369:38.96]No, I mean, like, in chat... Where, like, just pick a random... Somebody says something and I pick it and we play it.
[369:46.09]Oh, God.
[369:46.85]Okay.
[369:50.03]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[369:51.09]Probably around, like, 6 o'clock Pacific.
[369:53.27]I'll set this up accordingly.
[369:55.14]See you soon.
[369:55.72]Thanks for hanging out.
[369:57.81]I'm glad I actually got to play Gunslinger, because it was a very solid, cool, fun game.
[370:05.23]Thank you for experiencing it with me.
[370:08.01]See you tomorrow.
[370:09.35]Take care of yourselves.
[370:13.00]9 p.m.
[370:13.54]Eastern Stream.
[370:14.12]Yeah, it's because I have a dentist appointment that I can't miss.
[370:18.50]It's probably going to be a while.
[370:20.16]It's scheduled.
[370:25.20]So I'm going to be there for a little while.
[370:28.84]I'll see you whenever I get... I'll probably turn it on at some point.
[370:33.02]Up to before 6.
[370:34.10]Maybe a little after.
[370:34.84]I don't know.
[370:35.22]We're just going to do whatever.
[370:38.07]See you soon.
[370:38.69]Take care.
[370:39.95]And good night.
[370:41.67]And no.
[370:42.19]Not good night.
[370:43.51]Not good night.
[370:44.09]Not yet.
[370:44.91]Because I'm going to run two ads.
[370:45.99]Otherwise people are going to scream at me the next time I turn my stream on.
[370:51.57]So.
[370:53.01]Let's run a couple ads.
[370:56.10]Here comes a 60 second ad break.
[371:01.23]See you guys later.
[371:04.33]Good night.
[371:05.67]Goodbye.
[371:06.03]Take care.
[371:18.64]Turning off ad block for this one.
[371:23.73]Running ads.
[371:28.06]We'll see, we'll see what they get.
[371:29.24]What'd you get?
[371:30.06]Samsung?
[371:30.78]Nice.
[371:37.90]Stream Legends?
[371:39.32]Stream Legends, unfortunately, is not ready yet.
[371:42.28]Because, uh... I went very into the early morning this morning.
[371:48.21]So, I did that at somewhere around 1 AM.
[371:53.91]Pacific.
[371:54.77]Today.
[371:56.98]So that's not... I can't do that for a long time.
[372:05.21]Didn't get an add?
[372:05.93]Well, I ran them.
[372:06.81]I'm telling you.
[372:07.83]They're ending in five seconds.
[372:13.48]And there it is.
[372:14.46]That's it.
[372:16.74]I will see you guys real soon.
[372:18.82]Take care of yourselves.
[372:19.94]Have a good one.
[372:22.05]Good night.
