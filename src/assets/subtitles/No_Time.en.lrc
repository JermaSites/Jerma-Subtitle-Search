[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.03]Hey, what's up?
[00:06.05]Sorry I'm a little late.
[00:06.69]I had to do my get ready thing I do in front of the mirror that all streamers do.
[00:17.06]If you don't know, after you get out of the shower and after you do your hair and you get something to eat, you have some water.
[00:23.88]I, like many others, go in front of the mirror.
[00:27.55]I just point at myself and I go, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it for about 25 minutes.
[00:35.90]Really get myself pumped up for the day.
[00:55.79]That would get in the way so much if you really had to do that.
[01:07.50]Just sitting here yelling own it to yourself in the mirror.
[01:12.19]But anyways, hi, how are you?
[01:14.37]Today, we're going to play a game about traveling through time.
[01:20.21]The game is called No Time.
[01:21.15]No Time.
[01:22.95]It's a game about driving around in a car.
[01:27.93]That car has time travel capabilities.
[01:31.38]It is a car game.
[01:32.96]Just to let you know, this is a car game.
[01:38.82]Could be very fun.
[01:47.08]Travel back to an hour ago when you weren't late.
[01:51.56]I think you can... I'm... Alright.
[01:53.50]From the description of this game, I think you can put in any date in modern human history.
[02:00.62]As long as it's 1 AD.
[02:05.30]So, I... Maybe we can go forward.
[02:10.31]Go back to 23 years ago.
[02:12.33]Oh, no.
[02:18.33]The title sucks?
[02:19.25]It doesn't matter.
[02:27.80]You guys are still doing the 20... Yeah.
[02:31.14]You still on the 23 thing?
[02:34.44]I have a question.
[02:35.38]How many of you guys watched the movie yesterday?
[02:39.62]You guys have had one full day in between the last stream?
[02:42.62]Anybody watch the movie?
[02:44.24]I have to assume some of you have.
[02:51.35]Why would I do that?
[02:52.39]I don't know.
[02:54.53]I thought about it.
[02:58.11]I was pretty close to... You know, is it on... Can I get it on, like, Amazon or, like, iTunes or something?
[03:03.19]What does this person say?
[03:11.37]I don't know.
[03:14.04]Whatever it was, it got removed.
[03:16.04]I think they're asking what the best VR headset is.
[03:18.06]Well, it depends.
[03:20.86]Do you want to save some money to get one of the small wireless ones?
[03:24.62]Or do you want to have the wire going into the back of your head?
[03:27.68]I don't know.
[03:32.64]I would say the index.
[03:33.70]The only problem is my index was kind of screwed up.
[03:36.66]My left ear of my index just kind of stopped working randomly.
[03:40.62]So, I don't know.
[03:41.34]I don't think I can say that.
[03:50.40]Can't wait for 2023.
[03:53.02]How do we end that joke?
[03:56.18]Do you know how unbearable 2023 is going to be on this channel if we don't end that joke?
[04:01.04]We have to find an exit for it.
[04:12.02]I can't wait till 2025.
[04:14.04]We got to come up with a new thing.
[04:16.92]We got to give you guys a new number because otherwise next year is going to be hell.
[04:25.11]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:27.17]Let's go.
[04:27.53]It took me long enough.
[04:29.15]I do have to say this.
[04:30.05]I know a lot of people are going to pogsad in the chat when they hear this, but after this stream, streams are going to be a little sporadic over the next couple of weeks.
[04:43.81]I've got a lot of work to do.
[04:46.60]I've got a lot of work to do.
[04:49.24]But seriously, I'm not going to be streaming this weekend.
[04:53.32]I'm not going to be streaming...
[04:55.71]They're going to be all over the place.
[04:56.65]A green screen will happen in the next week.
[04:59.35]I'm going to give you a hard date.
[05:01.85]Very soon.
[05:06.19]Within the next 10 days.
[05:11.08]But that June into July is probably going to be the busiest I've been since...
[05:21.07]2021 a few months two or three months before the dollhouse there's a lot of stuff going on so I don't worry I'm not gonna you'll see me I'm not going away I'm gonna try to do one or two streams a week until july at least so don't worry I'm not going anywhere what happened I was playing fallout
[05:47.95]Uh, the streams are going to be sporadic.
[05:50.49]That's it.
[05:52.33]But not too, don't worry.
[05:53.35]It's not like I'm going to not stream for like, don't worry.
[05:57.83]Since 2022, all through 2021, I was kind of a once a week Andy.
[06:03.55]That's probably not going to happen.
[06:06.17]So don't worry.
[06:06.65]It's not like I'm going to go to once a week in the next month.
[06:10.55]Don't worry about that.
[06:12.67]They already are once a week.
[06:13.77]No, it's not.
[06:14.31]I do like, I do like two or three times a week.
[06:17.63]I stream three times a week.
[06:19.38]Since 2022.
[06:26.82]I went back to the old pre-Vegas schedule.
[06:30.58]Three times a week or so.
[06:34.55]Actually, the first year in Vegas, wasn't I streaming four plus days a week?
[06:42.15]Yeah.
[06:45.98]Oh, come on.
[06:48.32]Stop.
[06:49.80]Stop it.
[06:50.28]2 to 23.
[06:52.15]Oh, my God.
[06:53.51]I'm going to give you another number.
[06:55.17]6. 6.
[06:59.45]Isn't that number 6 cool?
[07:01.64]There's so many things that you can add up to make 6.
[07:03.68]2 plus 2 plus 2 is 6.
[07:07.10]7 minus 1 is 6.
[07:09.68]6 times 0 is 0.
[07:13.33]But 666, that's the devil number.
[07:17.27]That's a crazy number, isn't it?
[07:18.83]That's a scary number.
[07:21.61]You know what number I really don't like?
[07:22.89]The number 6.
[07:23.47]Because 666, that's devil.
[07:25.49]I'm scared of the devil.
[07:28.02]Now don't meme that one.
[07:29.44]Don't meme that one.
[07:30.48]Don't do that.
[07:32.16]No, I fucking hate that.
[07:35.30]Did it work?
[07:35.62]Alright, let's go.
[07:36.98]How you doing?
[07:43.90]What's up?
[07:46.72]Uh, this is no time.
[07:50.28]Is my camera in the right?
[07:54.04]Just making sure.
[07:57.46]Nice evil hair.
[07:58.78]Yeah, that's alright.
[08:01.25]Alright, let's get it up.
[08:04.83]See, what would have been really funny is if I had been in a Back to the Future costume with goggles and a big lab coat.
[08:14.58]And before I turned the stream on, my webcam, I was like, Oh, here we go.
[08:19.28]Oh, we're going to go for it.
[08:20.48]We're going to find a future.
[08:21.76]We're going to go back to the future.
[08:22.98]And it was I was in a Back to the Future costume.
[08:24.90]And that would be funny.
[08:28.35]I think you guys would like that.
[08:29.25]Alright, let's go.
[08:32.01]This is a driving game.
[08:33.17]Is this a controller game?
[08:40.48]This is a car game.
[08:41.28]Maybe I should use a controller.
[08:45.06]Thanks for your disappointment.
[08:50.47]That would be Richard Nixon.
[08:51.65]That was not Richard Nixon.
[08:54.34]I can't... You can't do... Alright, listen.
[08:56.78]This is important for all of you watching at home.
[09:00.04]If I do a Doc impression, I'm doing a Rick impression.
[09:03.78]And you all hate that.
[09:04.90]Nobody can ever do a Doc impression ever again.
[09:07.61]Because you're just doing Rick from Rick and Morty.
[09:09.69]You understand?
[09:11.65]Like, I would have tried to go into it and really do it, but it would have been Rick.
[09:17.51]Let me try to do a Doc.
[09:19.37]Oh!
[09:20.47]Morty!
[09:21.07]We've got to be careful!
[09:23.73]Back in there and we're going to go back in time to save them.
[09:25.99]Actually, it is different.
[09:32.00]Morty!
[09:33.58]Morty, we gotta be careful.
[09:35.76]I don't know.
[09:36.68]Guys, I've never seen all these movies.
[09:37.78]I've never seen them.
[09:38.76]I just know, I know Christopher Lloyd.
[09:40.06]Christopher Lloyd!
[09:41.18]Right?
[09:44.23]His name's Morty, not Marty.
[09:45.67]Marty, not Morty.
[09:47.65]I just dropped everything.
[09:48.79]Alright, stop.
[09:49.99]Let's go.
[09:52.59]Alright, let's play the core game.
[09:54.47]Play the official story campaign of no time along with all side stories and secrets.
[09:57.85]Sure, why not?
[09:59.37]You guys ready?
[10:02.85]Can I drive?
[10:06.91]Sir Adam, the energy source of the future requires a fusion reactor.
[10:12.95]I gotta put my headphones in to understand.
[10:16.36]PLC entry.
[10:18.65]Hello and welcome to No Time, a Lost in Days experience.
[10:23.87]If you've got a minute, I'd like to take you through the basics of the game.
[10:27.75]Why is there crash dummy stuff on there?
[10:31.19]All right, let's go.
[10:31.65]Tutorial.
[10:32.37]W-W-W-W-W-A-S-D.
[10:35.69]Pretty good.
[10:36.11]Press space to jump and left alt to crouch.
[10:38.77]Is there a punch?
[10:39.89]Left alt is crouch?
[10:42.49]That's changing.
[10:48.37]uh that's got to come down to like 30 uh crouches left alt we're gonna make that c is compass use is f when did this change use was e for 50 years and they just everybody collectively all decided it was gonna be f why please help me with this what happened
[11:17.85]E, E, E was for everything.
[11:19.33]It was for use.
[11:20.11]It was for interaction.
[11:20.99]Now it's F. Everyone collectively at the same time said that was a good idea.
[11:26.81]Why?
[11:27.82]There has to be a reason, right?
[11:29.18]Because Q and E is for leaning.
[11:32.10]Oh, that, whatever.
[11:33.10]That's right.
[11:34.36]All right, I'm going to make this what I want.
[11:35.82]So it's going to be E. Take is going to be F.
[11:40.42]Sandbox, that's fine.
[11:41.68]Full power mode, G. Zoom, X. Punch?
[11:47.30]There is a punch.
[11:47.84]Holy shit.
[11:48.32]Okay, there's a throw.
[11:49.46]This game's already pretty much a 9 out of 10 so far.
[11:52.75]Crouch is going to be C. Compass is going to be Control.
[11:56.95]Or Tab.
[11:59.19]No.
[12:00.33]Compass.
[12:01.99]Compass.
[12:02.33]I don't know.
[12:03.17]Two?
[12:03.67]Four.
[12:05.01]Compass is going to be four.
[12:06.03]I don't know why.
[12:08.01]Because it's like four directions.
[12:09.54]North, south, east, west.
[12:11.72]That makes sense to me.
[12:13.74]Zoom.
[12:14.02]That's fine.
[12:14.38]All right.
[12:14.58]I think this is good.
[12:16.08]If I need to change it again.
[12:17.08]Car.
[12:18.64]WASD.
[12:19.18]Space.
[12:20.14]Fly mode.
[12:20.94]Thrust up.
[12:21.78]Up arrow.
[12:23.44]Time conductor.
[12:24.32]Cooling.
[12:24.94]Okay.
[12:25.30]What about ride?
[12:26.06]All right.
[12:27.34]I think we're good.
[12:28.74]Uranium?
[12:29.22]Did you say E?
[12:30.23]Wait, what?
[12:30.83]Didn't I say... Wait, didn't I say E?
[12:33.97]He said E. What's going on?
[12:37.91]Am I going crazy?
[12:38.73]No, seriously, I'm going crazy after just saying that.
[12:40.41]What's going on?
[13:00.02]What?
[13:00.72]Oh.
[13:01.30]It is F. Okay.
[13:03.56]Alright.
[13:03.80]Put the uranium on top of the reactor chamber.
[13:06.12]Use number 1 to 7 to scroll through your inventory.
[13:08.49]Or mouse wheel.
[13:09.15]Alright.
[13:11.45]So put it in.
[13:11.81]What?
[13:11.97]What?
[13:12.13]Okay.
[13:12.33]I have to eventually come back to 1984...
[13:29.40]Day 2.
[13:31.80]At 0, 0, 0.
[13:33.54]Turn the volume up.
[13:34.28]I will.
[13:36.58]Okay.
[13:36.74]Ah, that's loud for me.
[13:37.50]Alright, useful notes.
[13:58.55]Like, fucking Jesus, why can't I just, I wanna, how can I grab it?
[14:02.01]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:06.85]I'm on step, what step am I on?
[14:09.57]Step one, insert uranium sample into reaction.
[14:11.72]Okay.
[14:13.10]Step two, get in the car.
[14:16.88]This, we got one lamp in the test zone?
[14:21.94]Step three, check the reactor temperature.
[14:23.48]Alright, we gotta get in the car.
[14:34.10]It's fucking dark in here.
[14:35.38]No, no, I need those notes.
[14:42.65]I don't know what to do.
[14:43.55]And you can save and load the game above.
[14:47.75]Oh, and if your reactor temperature is above 300 degrees Fahrenheit, cool it down first.
[14:54.99]Okay, cool debris.
[14:55.91]Oh, and you can look up the controls in the pause menu.
[15:00.76]Alright, so we can't go over 300 degrees.
[15:01.90]Alright.
[15:02.18]Let's go.
[15:02.48]Drive.
[15:02.70]How do I drive?
[15:03.42]I need those notes.
[15:05.14]How do I get out of the car?
[15:06.78]I need the notes that are on the top.
[15:30.46]Find an advanced source of energy for the reactor.
[15:33.54]Estimations would be around 2014, I think, or a little later, okay?
[15:38.96]Uranium samples as temporary power source are in the luggage space.
[15:43.47]Do not travel through time if the reactor temperature is above 300 degrees.
[15:48.37]Avoid yourself at all costs, okay?
[15:51.15]I repeat, avoid yourself.
[15:55.67]What about the actual useful notes?
[15:58.29]Give me this.
[16:01.32]Step 5.
[16:01.74]Toggle the time conduction and enter the date into the timetable that order.
[16:05.10]Alright.
[16:09.66]Step 6.
[16:10.32]The travel sequence should start... That's month, day, year, and then hmm.
[16:15.00]What is hmm?
[16:17.71]Travel sequence should start at about 70 miles per hour.
[16:19.69]Okay.
[16:22.49]Let's go.
[16:32.34]Get in the fucking car.
[16:33.06]Alright, here we go.
[16:34.86]It's time to set our destination.
[16:36.58]We are gonna go to... Type a date and time.
[16:42.72]Um... What am I pressing?
[16:48.66]Date 12?
[16:54.84]What did I just do?
[16:56.08]Type a date and confirm.
[16:57.36]I just... Who shot me?
[17:07.15]What?
[17:10.47]Why did I just explode?
[17:11.64]What just happened?
[17:15.20]Why am I like fucking three feet tall?
[17:18.98]What a terrible nightmare.
[17:27.02]Hello?
[17:28.02]Open up.
[17:28.68]Hello?
[17:30.68]Shut this off!
[17:36.33]What happened?
[17:37.35]Oh, that's me doing that.
[17:48.55]Turn it down.
[17:52.78]Hello?
[17:53.54]Who is it?
[17:56.02]Finally, have you been sleeping on the floor again?
[17:59.26]You bet I had made some progress by now.
[18:02.50]Edward, but...
[18:05.94]Tell me you finished the reactor.
[18:08.31]I did, but awesome.
[18:09.87]Come on now, there's a little time.
[18:12.21]Our supervisor will show up soon.
[18:13.59]We need the machined if you're ready.
[18:17.06]Holy shit, this guy.
[18:19.90]The time machine.
[18:20.78]Come on now, we got no time.
[18:22.04]Alright, grab the reactor and follow me to the elevator.
[18:33.43]Alright, there's a reactor.
[18:34.23]I think they had coffee.
[18:38.21]Stack of bo- How- That's a reactor.
[18:39.59]Give it to me.
[18:47.82]Let's go.
[18:52.34]Oops.
[18:54.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[18:55.83]Put your hand in the door.
[18:56.83]I dropped the reactor.
[18:57.99]Put your hand in the door.
[19:03.07]Alright, let's go.
[19:04.39]Where we going?
[19:07.71]I'm holding the reactor.
[19:09.33]You press the button to go to the lobby for the... Oh, give me a break.
[19:13.37]Why would I have to do this?
[19:14.47]I'm holding a fucking nuclear reactor or whatever this is.
[19:20.22]I'll do it.
[19:22.62]I'm sorry.
[19:23.14]If somebody has one of these, they go and let this...
[19:26.29]And there's going to be a person in front, a person to each side, and a person behind walking with them.
[19:32.07]All moving step by step at the same time.
[19:35.98]And there's going to be somebody literally... There's going to be something attached to their stomach.
[19:39.96]Like a big umbrella underneath them.
[19:41.94]So if they drop it, it just goes right into the big chute.
[19:44.19]Like an umbrella.
[19:46.35]There's no way somebody's holding this in their hands like this.
[19:48.09]Alright, so this is the... This is it.
[19:56.33]Quest turn in.
[19:59.74]Edward looks proud.
[20:00.60]Wow, a Mach 3?
[20:03.12]Yep, I modified it to reach speeds of up to 90 miles per hour.
[20:06.85]And to also give you a nice clean shave.
[20:09.09]Cleaner than a single blade.
[20:11.25]Let's hope it will last longer than the Mach 2.
[20:14.69]I heard that C-Corp is working on nuclear-fueled cars.
[20:18.92]We're going to beat them to it.
[20:21.00]Oh, stop.
[20:22.48]Let's assemble the rest of the car first.
[20:23.90]Hope your reactor works.
[20:25.78]Open the reactor hatch and insert it in the front of the car.
[20:27.48]Alright, let's go.
[20:29.04]Let's do it.
[20:44.60]Alright, got it.
[20:46.54]You didn't say I had to open the first car we had.
[20:48.94]We didn't have to do that.
[20:51.60]Alright, now the time core is what makes time travel possible.
[20:56.07]Converts a frequency of time stream into an actual date and time.
[21:00.91]Where the fuck did you go?
[21:02.99]How do I close this?
[21:06.69]Presently, you can only compute the dates in between roughly 4000 BC and 2030.
[21:11.81]But I'll figure out a way to mend it.
[21:13.11]The time frequency just oscillates.
[21:15.27]Though currently, you can only input dates after 1 AD anyway.
[21:19.44]Okay.
[21:24.04]Alright, so what's the deal?
[21:26.38]He sounds like Peter Griffin?
[21:29.52]Let's do a test run.
[21:33.58]Pfft.
[21:37.34]Oh, fucking come on.
[21:39.09]I know, I know.
[21:39.55]I promise the time displacement procedure will occur this time, even if you crash the car into the wall.
[21:46.45]I've had nightmares ever since.
[21:47.48]I'm lucky to be alive.
[21:50.04]Or maybe the rest of the island, the accelerator could have gotten destroyed in a nuclear blast due to the impact.
[21:56.31]Don't worry.
[21:57.29]I made the car very sturdy, so the probability of a nuclear explosion... Yes, but first retrieve the personal log computer.
[22:04.86]Please.
[22:06.32]They're on the table.
[22:10.60]Yeah, it's like if Peter Griffin was in Undertale.
[22:13.62]I know what you mean.
[22:14.14]Alright, dress in the hazmat suit.
[22:22.57]Should I be in this?
[22:31.27]What is this thing?
[22:34.45]What am I looking at here?
[22:40.51]Okay, I got it.
[22:42.21]Oh no, what do you want me to do?
[22:48.99]Is it those notes or something?
[22:50.03]What do you want me to do?
[22:55.75]What do you want me to do?
[22:58.89]They say there was something on the table.
[23:00.08]This is what was on the table.
[23:05.69]What do you want me to do?
[23:07.24]I don't remember.
[23:07.80]What do you want me to do?
[23:10.34]The computer.
[23:10.88]Okay, thanks.
[23:20.48]It's the Pip-Boy.
[23:23.81]Okay.
[23:25.21]Prologue.
[23:26.81]Edward gave me his newest PLC, a few bug fixes, and so on.
[23:29.93]Let's talk to Edward.
[23:32.93]Ooh, there's music.
[23:37.26]Isn't it great?
[23:37.72]It works.
[23:38.52]Made a few bug fixes and cleanups.
[23:40.54]Hope it'll help you with your work in the future.
[23:44.38]Looking cool.
[23:45.08]Thanks, Ed.
[23:47.52]This game is random?
[23:49.88]Can you strap it on my arm?
[23:51.82]This thing weighs like three kilos.
[23:53.38]I don't think you want that kind of strain on your wrist.
[23:56.30]Anyways, you see I've strapped... I'm not suffocating, right?
[23:59.16]Am I just suffocating in a suit?
[24:02.94]Okay, what do you want me to do?
[24:07.87]I've strapped a meter on the right side of the PLC.
[24:09.75]It tells you whenever a temporal shift occurs.
[24:13.87]Remember our little theory session?
[24:15.75]This shift happens when your activity in space-time reaches a certain threshold.
[24:19.53]Time itself morphs around your actions, wiping your past selves, since you or anything you left in that time weren't meant to be there.
[24:28.05]Oh, of course.
[24:29.61]It's the grandpa paradox.
[24:33.96]I think.
[24:39.04]The Grandpa Paradox is if you go back in time before you were born, you technically weren't born, so therefore your grandfather had to have been alive first for you to be alive, so therefore you can't exist in that time frame.
[24:51.95]It's called the Grandpa Paradox.
[24:58.31]It's something like that.
[25:01.76]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:02.66]It's if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, then you can't exist, so you disappear.
[25:07.86]And you fade out like in the movies.
[25:21.16]Why would you do that?
[25:26.65]Oh yeah, I got a time machine!
[25:28.25]The first thing I'm gonna do!
[25:29.75]Oh man, I could go see anything in human history!
[25:32.59]I could go forward, I could see what the world looks like, I could see what happened back when the dinosaurs... No, I think I'm just gonna go kill my grandfather and disappear.
[25:40.87]What?
[25:42.13]Well, yeah, why would I do that?
[25:43.37]Why would I do that?
[25:50.47]That's a Chad move?
[25:52.83]No, it's not?
[26:06.67]Giga Chad goes back in time to kill his grandfather.
[26:13.12]If you drop something sometime in the past, it would vanish.
[26:17.33]What is this, the grandfather- This is the grandpa paradox, right?
[26:20.03]Bigger changes would prob- Oh, no, the grandpa paradox is if you go, swat a mosquito on your arm, then your grandfather never meets your grandmother, because everything can change, possibly.
[26:30.48]And then, when you go forward in time, you look out the window, and it's raining donuts, and you wish you would have stayed in that timeline, but you- you got really freaked out at something that happened at the family dinner table, so you left before it started raining the donuts.
[26:44.99]I understand.
[26:46.58]I understand.
[26:50.48]It's a fucking Simpsons episode!
[26:52.70]You say I'm the one that's not a cultured media viewer?
[26:56.08]That happened in The Simpsons, and all of you are question-marking me, and everyone says Simpsons is the best fucking TV show ever made.
[27:00.67]And that was back when The Simpsons were in the first 10 years of its existence, not the last 20 years of its existence.
[27:07.43]To me, the last 20 years of The Simpsons' existence has been like an iPad ad for, like, a mobile game.
[27:12.84]Like, trailer.
[27:14.54]That's the same thing for me.
[27:15.86]The last, like, 10 to 15 years of The Simpsons has been like an iPad trailer.
[27:20.55]I just, like, I skip it.
[27:21.57]I don't want to watch this.
[27:23.51]What were we doing?
[27:24.01]I don't know.
[27:24.39]Leave me alone.
[27:24.87]I'm fucking relaxing.
[27:28.91]You need to fix the fragmentation.
[27:30.55]I'm just sitting here, like, breathing in my own, like, carbon dioxide.
[27:34.50]What's... Alright.
[27:36.42]I said I was going to chill out today.
[27:38.26]And that's happening.
[27:39.10]So stop fucking saying the number 23 or you're going to be fucking banned.
[27:44.35]Back to it.
[27:46.61]You need to fix the fragmentation of time for me.
[27:51.03]So during some tests of the core, I ended up making rifts in the time space continuum.
[27:55.19]I sent boxes with items through time, but they came back empty with strange letters inside them.
[28:00.31]Just keep that in mind.
[28:01.07]Don't lose sight of your boxes while time traveling.
[28:06.32]I should make a box that's a mailbox and I put it in one place.
[28:11.40]And if you put stuff into it, it goes back and forth in time.
[28:15.20]And then I could have a pen pal to communicate with somebody from a different time period.
[28:22.39]That'd be cool.
[28:27.85]Somebody said play the fucking game.
[28:33.33]I have to be honest, I'm very confused.
[28:34.82]I am playing the game.
[28:36.04]There's a lot of dialogue.
[28:37.20]Okay, let's go.
[28:41.29]No time for that.
[28:41.79]Drive the car into the acceleration tunnel, move the car to the starting position, then wait for my signal.
[28:46.09]When I open the gates, the mod chip, which I inserted earlier, will send you exactly one hour into the future.
[28:51.67]Make sure to remove the chip afterwards.
[28:53.05]It blocks the time input, okay?
[28:54.57]Alright, let's go.
[29:06.59]Yeah, why one hour?
[29:11.82]Okay, so he said it already.
[29:14.48]Did he said it already?
[29:21.19]Did you turn it on?
[29:21.85]I brought him over.
[29:40.67]Save the game?
[29:45.18]Alright, that's good.
[29:46.02]Save it right here.
[29:48.44]The save system's not turning on.
[29:52.96]Can I help you?
[29:57.79]Alright.
[29:59.51]Let's go!
[29:59.97]Turn it on!
[30:00.81]Is it on?
[30:11.67]Okay, here we go!
[30:12.23]Oh, fuck.
[30:19.35]You need to put the uranium in.
[30:20.57]Didn't I already do that?
[30:21.77]It's right there.
[30:25.04]Didn't I already do that?
[30:26.80]I already did that, didn't I?
[30:34.88]Oh, it's... Okay, I didn't know it was the second thing.
[30:36.91]Alright, let's go.
[30:40.17]Here we go!
[30:41.61]So get to the starting point, which is over here.
[30:56.72]I'm imagining this is probably the starting point.
[30:58.16]Are you going to open the door?
[31:05.20]Alright, let's go!
[31:07.41]Everything seems to be active.
[31:10.31]Activate them.
[31:10.91]I think they're active.
[31:14.59]Reactor.
[31:16.05]On.
[31:18.60]Accelerate to 70 miles per hour.
[31:20.05]Time conductor on.
[31:22.61]Get ready.
[31:22.99]Let's go!
[31:47.36]Suspect located!
[31:48.42]You're coming with us?
[32:00.49]I got one!
[32:01.07]I got one!
[32:02.57]What do we do?
[32:03.77]Drive the car down the secret door!
[32:05.17]I can't fucking see anything with this stupid suit on!
[32:15.28]You just skipped over that hour and here you are.
[32:17.86]Incredible.
[32:19.34]Are you alright?
[32:22.16]Like, do you feel weird in any way?
[32:23.30]Don't worry about the guys back there.
[32:24.44]I'll be explaining in due time.
[32:25.56]Do you want a gun?
[32:27.00]What is this place?
[32:29.25]Yes, my personal invention.
[32:30.43]A stun gun, to be precise.
[32:31.57]The first prototype that works.
[32:33.11]Oh, but this place... This is my secret hideout.
[32:37.37]I installed a secret door, entrance, and so on.
[32:39.87]I knew it would come in handy someday.
[32:42.17]Is it even legal?
[32:44.94]I don't know.
[32:46.88]What's going on here?
[32:47.56]Do you want the short version or the long version?
[32:50.94]Whatever.
[32:52.70]Agents, they broke into the facility and are raiding all our research.
[32:56.02]We need to get the machine out of here.
[32:58.89]They call them that on the news.
[33:00.67]C-Corp has made no comments on whether they got attacked too.
[33:04.45]How do we get the machine out unnoticed?
[33:08.57]Unnoticed?
[33:08.97]Not possible.
[33:09.55]I know how to give you enough time before they catch up, though.
[33:12.10]This room leads to the drainage tunnels of the facility.
[33:14.02]From there, you can move on the main road, which leads to Pine Island.
[33:18.60]Just go as far away as possible, jump some time into the future, just till things cool off.
[33:23.41]We'll meet each other somehow.
[33:25.49]What about you?
[33:26.89]Someone needs to distract them from you and our invention.
[33:29.07]Don't sweat it.
[33:29.71]I'll make it out.
[33:30.71]This is only one of many hideouts.
[33:32.47]Someone needs to hold the floodgates open for you, and I have my stun gun.
[33:35.09]Don't worry.
[33:36.95]We'll see each other on the other side.
[33:38.45]Outside, you'll need to open the first gate.
[33:40.63]There's no time.
[33:41.39]Hurry!
[33:46.45]Open it!
[33:46.89]Let's go!
[33:51.35]Let's go.
[33:51.83]Get me out.
[33:52.35]Get me out.
[33:56.63]Don't worry.
[33:56.97]I know a way out.
[33:57.55]Alright.
[33:57.97]Open it!
[33:58.99]Let's go!
[34:02.97]Good luck.
[34:03.77]Um...
[34:08.19]I need to put a new date in, right?
[34:10.93]Reactor is on.
[34:11.85]Okay.
[34:12.35]Put a new date in.
[34:14.57]Um.
[34:15.57]Type in a date.
[34:16.33]Month?
[34:18.41]Four?
[34:18.85]What is it?
[34:19.17]What's April?
[34:20.99]April 4?
[34:21.63]04?
[34:23.48]Dude, what am I looking at here?
[34:28.66]What is going on?
[34:29.50]No, I don't understand.
[34:31.58]Cool it off, cool it off, cool it off.
[34:44.00]How do I actually do this?
[34:49.40]What the fuck?
[34:53.42]Set destination.
[34:56.65]4, 1, 1, 2.
[34:57.19]How do I actually use this thing?
[35:05.31]Time target.
[35:07.53]Present departure.
[35:08.83]How do I punch this in?
[35:09.87]41 o'clock.
[35:19.84]I don't want to actually go to this time period.
[35:24.57]It literally said... Yeah, but I... Okay, I... That's... I don't know... There's one, two, three, four, five, six slots.
[35:30.48]How am I supposed to know which one I'm doing?
[35:32.24]Okay, when I just typed it in, it did this one, this one, then this... It, like, jumped around.
[35:42.06]Because this is the present day.
[35:43.36]Is that departure time?
[35:46.72]Type in a date.
[35:47.54]Okay, like, month first.
[35:50.66]04 is April.
[35:52.38]Right?
[35:54.35]Why is it not working?
[35:56.91]I'm just fucking driving.
[35:59.47]It's the letters?
[36:03.09]What are you talking about?
[36:05.05]Letters for month first.
[36:11.55]APR... No, guys, it doesn't work.
[36:15.27]It doesn't work.
[36:15.75]Nothing works.
[36:22.10]APR is April... Yeah, but I can't... You don't understand.
[36:25.42]I can't change it.
[36:26.02]It doesn't make any sense.
[36:36.37]Type a date and confirm with enter.
[36:41.29]Okay, let's try this again.
[36:42.16]I need to remove the override chip.
[36:46.92]Alright, let's take it out.
[36:54.13]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[37:24.83]Okay, let me try this again.
[37:26.15]Time target.
[37:31.41]Alright, the reactor's off.
[37:32.19]Everything's good.
[37:33.71]Should I travel now?
[37:34.83]Do I have to go... I have to go 70.
[37:38.22]Get the chip out.
[37:38.88]Hold on.
[37:44.82]Dude, can I... How do I rip the fucking chip out of the thing?! !
[37:58.31]Give it to me!
[38:13.38]Alright, let's go.
[38:16.04]Okay, I made it out.
[38:17.26]Quest complete.
[38:18.42]Don't pull that up while you're driving!
[38:20.22]Okay.
[38:26.50]Sounds good.
[38:31.14]Oh, that was just scripted.
[38:31.93]I just... Okay, I get it.
[38:38.13]Wait, this is not an ending, right?
[38:55.52]In the heat of the takeover, planned by his group, one of the inventors managed to... No, okay, I got it.
[39:06.10]I shouldn't have even been touching anything.
[39:07.24]This was all the scripted first, like, 20 minutes of the game.
[39:14.63]Everybody, like, wants me to go back to, like, fucking 100 AD, but, like, I can't even do that.
[39:19.69]Now I have access to this stuff.
[39:25.92]Take this off.
[39:26.78]It's gonna give me a fucking headache.
[39:39.61]Okay.
[39:40.59]So.
[39:44.09]I made it out.
[39:45.93]Now, let's get in here.
[39:51.55]Get that thing out of here.
[39:54.63]Do I have a trunk or anything I can put this stuff in?
[39:56.29]I feel like it's going to fall out.
[39:57.16]Okay.
[40:01.76]Save the game.
[40:04.32]The autosave cannot be overwritten.
[40:05.60]Well, then this one.
[40:08.84]1.
[40:09.12]Alright, cool.
[40:10.64]So, we are currently April 15th, 1984.
[40:17.17]13.
[40:18.31]Departure... What does that mean?
[40:27.13]Where should I go?
[40:29.22]Set date.
[40:30.46]Type a date and time.
[40:31.50]Okay, so I'm going to type in... It's a month first.
[40:37.78]Which would be 04, right?
[40:40.18]Okay, yeah, it is 04, not APR.
[40:43.56]So let's do 04... 14.
[40:48.07]Let's go yesterday.
[40:48.83]1984.
[40:50.37]And then we're going to do it at... 10 o'clock.
[41:00.30]We're going to go to yesterday.
[41:03.08]That's exciting.
[41:04.28]I'm just testing to see if the machine works!
[41:08.02]Guys, know what?
[41:10.30]Fuck that.
[41:11.18]If you had access to a time machine, you are going to just go back a day or so, man.
[41:18.00]I'm not going back a thousand years.
[41:20.00]What if I get stuck?
[41:23.34]What if I get stuck?
[41:25.02]I need to test to make sure it works.
[41:27.99]Let's go for it.
[41:28.53]You ready?
[41:44.12]Let's go!
[41:44.56]What's happening?
[41:46.91]What's happening?
[41:54.19]I didn't hit enter.
[41:57.65]Yeah, I did.
[41:59.01]Oh, my... 04-14-1984.
[41:59.35]10 o'clock.
[41:59.85]Enter.
[42:01.03]Reactor.
[42:01.53]Let's go!
[42:12.97]I don't have any uranium left?
[42:16.51]Oh shit!
[42:19.25]I need to put the chip back in?
[42:23.31]Where is it?
[42:25.27]Where's the chip?
[42:26.89]Oh fuck.
[42:28.37]I thought I had to take the chip out because that was like the safety protocol.
[42:35.32]Oh dear god, where the fuck is it?
[42:43.23]Where is it?
[42:47.13]I don't think I need to do that, guys.
[42:48.99]It wasn't part of the game that I take the chip out.
[42:52.37]No, it's not relevant.
[42:53.19]It's not.
[42:54.75]Am I out of reactor fluid?
[42:59.01]How can I tell?
[42:59.45]Is there a way to tell?
[43:15.44]Okay.
[43:21.29]Why am I moving?
[43:24.89]Why am I moving?
[43:30.44]What's going on?
[43:31.22]The car's moving on its own.
[43:34.60]I mean, I'm driving it now, but that was weird.
[43:36.36]Why was it doing that?
[43:40.87]Okay.
[43:43.89]I will need to... Okay.
[43:45.43]I always wanted to visit the distant future of 2014.
[43:48.05]Okay.
[43:48.95]Remove that mod chip.
[43:52.42]Afterwards, I can input the destination if the time conduction is active and confirm it with enter.
[43:59.40]Do I have to go to 2014?
[44:15.96]Is it just scripted?
[44:19.16]It said to get some snacks first.
[44:20.34]There's a donut shop right here.
[44:21.94]I don't have any fuel.
[44:25.77]Where was that donut shop?
[44:30.53]Back there, right?
[44:31.67]Yeah.
[44:31.97]It said get snacks.
[44:33.27]Because I have like a hunger beater.
[44:45.30]Uranium is at 0%.
[44:46.10]Oh, okay.
[44:48.00]That makes sense.
[44:57.25]So I should have one more uranium pod?
[44:59.63]Or do I have to actually go find one?
[45:07.20]Alright, let's get out of here.
[45:11.04]I have no money.
[45:16.82]The best donuts.
[45:18.72]I don't have any money.
[45:22.18]Can I just take them?
[45:35.21]Sell the car.
[45:39.46]Alright, so what does the quest want me to... What does it say?
[45:42.44]Go first.
[45:42.72]Go first.
[45:45.87]Buy some snacks?
[45:46.49]I don't have any money.
[45:48.39]Where am I supposed to get... You're telling me to buy snacks, but you're not telling me where I get money.
[45:52.96]I don't have... I have zero dollars.
[45:55.36]Do I have something in the trunk?
[46:13.95]There's so much back there.
[46:16.09]You don't have your hazmat suit on?
[46:17.73]I don't care.
[46:18.43]I don't give a shit.
[46:23.38]No, that's wrong.
[46:24.20]Somebody pulls up.
[46:26.20]Hey, can I give you a hand there, stranger?
[46:29.18]Yeah.
[46:29.90]Can you come in here?
[46:31.68]Can you hold this?
[46:52.21]Alright, we got 100% uranium.
[46:53.71]I'm ready.
[46:54.07]I'm ready to go.
[46:57.36]Okay.
[46:58.48]We've got uranium.
[46:59.74]I'm going to April 14th, 1984 at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[47:06.38]I want to see if it works.
[47:17.63]Here we go.
[47:29.32]Alright.
[47:31.82]Alright.
[47:32.70]I'm back.
[47:34.79]It is currently April 14th, 1984 at 10 o'clock.
[47:42.07]Look it!
[47:42.97]Everyone's a- Don't be alarmed!
[47:54.06]You'll be talking about this for centuries, motherfuckers!
[48:08.86]This would be the number one article on top of every webpage.
[48:14.36]You know what's... Yeah, I got out and I punched that guy.
[48:16.52]Yep.
[48:17.60]You know what's funny, though?
[48:18.80]That guy will be on every... That guy will be interviewed for every major news outlet.
[48:29.93]I probably made that guy fucking at least $100,000.
[48:38.62]That guy's gonna write a book.
[48:40.56]And everyone will buy it.
[48:41.58]Because, like, you're the guy that, like, the time traveler interacted with.
[48:46.32]Oh, fuck.
[48:46.80]I'm gonna be... I'll turn it off!
[48:48.24]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[48:58.76]I almost just fucking exploded in, like, a nuclear reaction.
[49:05.21]Can I do anything?
[49:13.26]Don't cut off the time traveler.
[49:14.46]That's a big mistake.
[49:16.76]There's got to be a quest I can do, right?
[49:18.28]I'm back a day ago.
[49:19.32]Should I go back to the facility?
[49:29.99]I want to go back to the facility.
[49:32.33]I'm going back to where I started.
[49:34.85]Back here.
[49:37.31]Wait a minute.
[49:41.92]This is literally a donut shop.
[49:44.28]Tomorrow.
[49:46.62]Right?
[49:47.56]Because there's the bridge.
[49:55.91]Alright, I want to go see what's going on at the facility.
[49:58.43]Your quest was for 2014.
[50:00.71]Yeah, but I wanted to... And now I understand how it works.
[50:03.37]I'm not going to fucking finagle around and flop around like an idiot.
[50:08.03]Oh.
[50:08.99]There's the donut place.
[50:14.49]It still sent you... No, it didn't.
[50:15.77]It didn't send me there.
[50:18.65]It's 1984.
[50:19.47]1047.
[50:25.36]Close the door.
[50:28.88]Close the car door, please.
[50:32.62]Because I want to see if he's there.
[50:33.62]There's money in your trunk.
[50:39.78]Alright, I'm very interested now.
[50:45.22]Now I get it.
[50:45.70]I understand how the game works.
[50:47.50]Don't worry.
[50:48.02]We're good.
[50:49.51]Relax.
[50:50.23]We've got plenty of time.
[50:57.87]The reactor's off.
[50:58.65]I wish I could close this door.
[51:04.44]Am I going to be in here?
[51:17.79]It's literally 1984.
[51:23.07]Go to 4-20-1969.
[51:23.71]What do I do?
[51:29.74]Just get out, walk around, and wheeze, laugh, and get in the car and leave?
[51:37.86]There might be material in here.
[51:41.97]Alright, so there it is.
[51:42.93]It's not on fire.
[51:48.14]Can I just go in the front door?
[52:08.92]Find yourself in the past and kill them?
[52:12.82]Alright, well here's the front door.
[52:13.72]I wonder if I can open this.
[52:25.68]Alright, if I'm looking at the security camera right now, then it's me in this car trying to get in the door.
[52:31.72]Jerma, I miss... I miss when you played games that had substance.
[52:35.23]Now you just play dog shit fart simulator games that are made for the purpose of being a meaningless shallow novelty to fill up your... Dude, I don't know where you've been for 12 years, but this is like the thing that I do.
[52:46.43]This is literally what I've been doing for like the last 12 fucking years.
[52:50.99]What are you... What's that person on about?
[52:58.39]My, like, fifth video I ever made on YouTube was Insane Aquarium.
[53:06.88]What are you, smoking crack?
[53:13.32]Alright.
[53:14.08]So, I don't think I can get in.
[53:17.62]I'm gonna go in the trunk, though, because now I can... Let me try something else.
[53:22.95]That's a grandpa video.
[53:26.47]There's 50 bucks in here.
[53:27.45]Alright.
[53:28.63]So, I'm gonna... Take this out.
[53:40.76]These things are finite.
[53:41.93]I gotta be really careful with this.
[53:55.58]Go to 2012?
[53:56.76]Let's go somewhere fucking weird.
[54:00.98]Right?
[54:02.16]I'll buy food later.
[54:03.66]I gotta be careful.
[54:04.30]I'm gonna run out of stuff.
[54:06.87]Alright, I'm gonna go to 2014.
[54:08.67]Because that's the quest.
[54:10.17]And I know I'm gonna fuck this up.
[54:11.41]I'm gonna softlock myself.
[54:12.37]So here we go.
[54:14.97]Let's just go to, like, I don't know.
[54:16.35]July... July 4th.
[54:26.28]2014, I guess.
[54:26.78]I don't know.
[54:28.36]Was it June?
[54:29.78]And then, I don't know, like 10?
[54:32.10]AM?
[54:34.66]July 4th?
[54:35.32]I don't know.
[54:43.19]Let me get a good straightaway.
[54:57.30]Let's go!
[54:58.44]I'm ready.
[54:59.10]We're gonna do the quest, and then after that I'm going to the dinosaurs.
[55:16.38]Alright, so I... I went... into the future.
[55:19.74]It's 2014.
[55:19.96]Ah!
[55:29.35]Okay.
[55:36.44]What's going on?
[55:38.26]Stop moving.
[55:39.64]Okay, so now what do I do?
[55:43.35]I always wanted to visit the distant 2014.
[55:49.09]Okay.
[55:50.21]Just have to lay low?
[56:01.60]This looks kind of the same.
[56:06.22]This looks identical.
[56:09.50]Nothing changed.
[56:10.36]What did I do?
[56:12.04]What?
[56:14.82]Wait, what happened?
[56:15.58]Did I just time travel to the same spot?
[56:20.34]At the same exact time?
[56:21.62]Wouldn't I have just crashed into myself and we both would have died?
[56:26.03]Oh my god, I wasted a fucking reactor.
[56:34.57]I only have two more of these.
[56:35.87]I'm gonna... That... I did... I... Why was... How would that have been a bit?
[56:48.57]I... I thought I was going to... What happened?
[56:52.65]July?
[56:54.47]Enter.
[56:55.73]Right?
[57:07.69]Okay, let's go for it.
[57:23.56]My trunk?
[57:24.18]What?
[57:24.50]What's wrong with the trunk?
[57:29.76]What?
[57:38.75]Don't scare me like that!
[57:40.13]Seriously, what the hell?
[57:45.09]Let's go.
[58:00.53]July 4th, 2014.
[58:01.07]It is 10 AM.
[58:01.27]Okay.
[58:18.28]I kind of want... Okay, I would... This is what I would do if I had a time machine.
[58:23.77]Okay, if I had a time machine.
[58:27.01]And I had unlimited uses on the time machine.
[58:32.49]I would go into this donut shop, right?
[58:35.62]And I would just go there.
[58:37.08]And I'd be like, how are you?
[58:38.08]How are you?
[58:38.46]Good to see you.
[58:39.50]And I would be like... And...
[58:43.07]Check that out.
[58:44.47]Bring it back.
[58:45.23]I'd say something really like odd, just specific.
[58:47.59]And I would hand the money and I would leave.
[58:49.19]And then I would come back like five years later.
[58:51.09]And I would do the same exact thing.
[58:53.71]I would just be a fucking customer at that point.
[58:56.42]Who cares?
[58:57.14]The person wouldn't even remember that you were there.
[58:59.24]They wouldn't give a shit at all.
[59:00.52]You would just be a customer coming in again.
[59:02.54]Like after five years.
[59:03.96]Why would I time travel to do that?
[59:05.24]That would be stupid.
[59:08.79]They would have forgotten that you came in, and they would have been like, oh, that guy was kind of weird.
[59:11.85]That guy maybe was in the area, maybe he doesn't live here.
[59:15.05]That would be fucking dumb.
[59:16.72]Never mind.
[59:17.12]Okay, I want donuts.
[59:20.78]Chocolate donut?
[59:28.53]Oh, thanks.
[59:29.09]Can I pick them up?
[59:32.53]What will it be, friend?
[59:33.17]I make the best donuts.
[59:36.55]You know, this would be a cool indicator to see if you went to a place and you went back in time five years and forward in time five years, did the donuts taste the same?
[59:43.95]Or did the, um... Go bring that donut back.
[59:51.12]What time is it?
[59:58.34]July 4th, 2014 at 1028.
[59:58.86]Come back and eat it again?
[60:17.49]Alright, well, there's a new quest here.
[60:19.03]Alright, Town Square.
[60:23.19]Go back and stop yourself from eating the donut.
[60:24.91]Yeah, because they changed the recipe and it's not as good.
[60:47.89]That's a cartoon.
[60:48.67]I don't want to do it because I don't want to run out of material.
[60:52.43]I can travel one more time.
[60:54.41]And you know the joke where if you got three wishes, Oh, I know what I would do.
[60:58.93]I have this crazy elaborate plans for each one.
[61:02.47]I just had five wishes.
[61:03.51]I'm down to one.
[61:04.23]I haven't done fucking anything.
[61:06.83]So I'm full of shit.
[61:09.89]You know, what have we done?
[61:11.83]I've accidentally went to the same place twice.
[61:15.59]I wanted to eat a donut again.
[61:19.59]What is this?
[61:25.95]What the fuck is that?
[61:27.15]What is that?
[61:28.70]What is that?
[61:32.30]Why is this here?
[61:32.94]Did I just drink that?
[61:40.56]Why are there giant radioactive crabs in 2014?
[61:42.96]Who's doing that?
[61:53.20]What the fuck is this?
[61:54.40]Is nobody else seeing this?
[61:57.54]Is nobody else seeing the giant crab that's attacking me?
[62:05.15]Hello.
[62:06.23]Wow, it's the future.
[62:08.75]Okay.
[62:11.45]Wow, the future.
[62:13.11]Bye.
[62:16.81]Get that thing out of here.
[62:24.73]I gotta go.
[62:25.23]I don't like that.
[62:29.03]I really don't like that thing.
[62:31.77]Alright, I'm looking for a technology center.
[62:41.02]I'm gonna get out of the... You have a quest.
[62:46.82]What is it?
[62:50.99]Any rumors?
[62:52.85]I've recently read about the bank robbery in the 1870s in a document in Pine Lake's archives.
[62:58.14]It's worth a read.
[62:58.76]It's what led Westwood into defeating 20 bandits single-handed.
[63:02.90]You remember the story.
[63:03.92]1870s.
[63:06.18]Okay.
[63:15.51]Somebody write that down.
[63:28.95]What just happened?
[63:33.69]That's two bucks?
[63:41.78]What can I get you?
[63:42.32]You don't have anything to buy.
[63:44.74]You don't have any products.
[63:45.70]Oh.
[64:02.21]Alright, I'm technically not going to steal it.
[64:03.75]I'm going to throw it outside.
[64:08.75]How much is this?
[64:11.91]I would like to buy this, please.
[64:15.89]And... What is this?
[64:19.65]Turns organic material into fuel.
[64:22.67]I only have $47.
[64:25.23]Box.
[64:27.82]This box fits a small amount of items.
[64:31.42]I probably should get the flashlight, right?
[64:32.86]Yeah.
[64:33.35]I'll take a flashlight.
[64:39.15]Oh my god.
[64:44.10]And... A radio?
[64:47.14]Wasn't your favorite radio stations?
[64:48.46]No, I don't want that.
[64:50.08]I'll take another reactor.
[64:55.53]Okay, this is what I would like to buy.
[65:01.90]Thank you.
[65:05.94]Can I take this out now, right?
[65:07.36]You're not going to get pissed?
[65:08.64]I have ten bucks left.
[65:17.71]Do other people have time machines?
[65:25.44]Get the radio.
[65:26.12]I don't want the radio.
[65:27.90]I don't have enough money.
[65:37.34]Okay.
[65:40.04]Do I have to hold it in front of my face?
[65:41.28]I have to... Who holds it like this?
[65:54.12]Can I not just put it on my... Okay.
[65:58.61]Alright, there we go, there we go, there we go.
[66:03.27]Put this in the trunk too.
[66:09.99]Alright, I gotta keep looking around because there's apparently a technology thing somewhere.
[66:21.93]Wait, is this it?
[66:27.21]Build the second mechanic.
[66:31.59]I'd like to modify my car.
[66:32.72]Can you repair my car?
[66:34.78]Park it in the garage and then I'll take a look at it.
[66:36.24]Alright.
[66:38.94]This thing's probably beat up.
[66:39.88]How much health does it have?
[66:41.22]Can I tell?
[66:41.56]Why are you dumb?
[66:52.29]Turn the flashlight off?
[67:01.13]Why do you care about the flashlight being on?
[67:14.61]There's no battery in the flashlight, dude.
[67:17.31]What are you talking about?
[67:28.59]Alright, what if I put my destination to 10 seconds ago?
[67:35.03]So my car pulls up and then there's a huge flash and another one of my cars pulls up.
[67:43.38]What would he do?
[67:44.22]What would he do?
[67:44.70]Okay, this thing's fixed.
[68:06.69]I want to go to the 1870s.
[68:15.29]Get out of the way.
[68:18.27]Alright, I need to... Let me do this quest part.
[68:20.15]I'm looking for... This is the town square, I'm assuming.
[68:30.38]Alright, can I fast forward, like, one minute to when I... After I did that jump?
[68:33.90]Because I'm gonna do it.
[68:40.50]Job requests?
[68:42.60]Oh, okay.
[68:43.04]Here's a new location.
[68:48.02]There was a bank robbery in Pine Lake during the 1870s.
[68:49.68]I bet you some money.
[68:58.70]Alright, where am I?
[69:03.90]Money drop head?
[69:05.92]Okay.
[69:14.18]This is definitely the town square.
[69:20.64]What else was in there?
[69:28.45]Oh, nice, a sandwich.
[69:36.07]Sheriff Westwood.
[69:38.94]Deeds of Sheriff Pine Lake.
[69:41.84]Okay, so the first quest is to go back.
[69:58.16]Oh, where is it?
[69:58.90]Hello, welcome to my workshop.
[70:03.12]I am E.R.
[70:05.28]Aether Inventor.
[70:09.28]Are you here for a scientific con- Ooh, it's him!
[70:12.14]It's, um... It's the guy.
[70:15.92]Hey.
[70:16.88]Wait a minute, you look rather familiar.
[70:19.11]Have we met before?
[70:21.17]Never mind that now.
[70:22.17]I'm in the middle of something big.
[70:25.15]Hey, is this something I've got to... We'll have plenty of time to talk later.
[70:29.01]I'm afraid this takes precedence.
[70:30.35]Okay.
[70:31.27]I'm building an atmospheric motivator.
[70:33.63]A device that transfuses the very particles of high and low temperatures at will.
[70:38.29]English professor.
[70:39.03]I'm building a weather machine and all I need is a couple of items to help with its assembly.
[70:42.96]What do you need?
[70:43.38]Okay.
[70:48.60]Here, take it.
[70:49.34]Copy it into your personal log.
[70:50.92]It shouldn't be too hard.
[70:52.08]There are only a few more things I need.
[70:55.01]magnetometer?
[70:56.09]It's a device which meters magnets, of course.
[71:01.51]Isn't it obvious?
[71:02.13]Besides, it's the MacGuffin.
[71:04.27]For most inventions these days, there should be some down the road at 612.
[71:07.21]Though they're pretty pricey.
[71:10.10]I suggest that you get it from Burns Scientific Store at Bridgetown.
[71:15.78]Bridgetown?
[71:19.94]The northern end of Cape Dun, a town located on top of a bridge, quite literally.
[71:24.64]C-Corp is behind that monstrosity to copy St.
[71:27.96]Andri, that ugly megacity just on the other side of the coast.
[71:31.22]Anyway, his shop is located on the top floor at the back.
[71:35.21]Okay, so we gotta go to the northern end of Cape Dun.
[71:39.35]Take a hover train to Bridgetown.
[71:42.41]I have a time machine.
[71:49.95]Okay.
[71:51.53]Uranium has been perfectly safe.
[71:52.61]Well, almost perfectly safe ever since the prismic ceiling glass was invented in 1992.
[71:57.18]10 times stronger than lead.
[72:01.22]Okay.
[72:06.96]I need something that can duct enough gigawatts to power the machine.
[72:13.79]Okay.
[72:15.17]A what?
[72:18.37]He's thinking.
[72:22.00]Too much lore?
[72:24.22]I think it's just enough lore.
[72:27.42]Okay.
[72:31.86]What could do the job?
[72:32.82]Unless you somehow get back my family heirloom pocket watch.
[72:37.37]Could I have gotten it back when I wasted a time travel device?
[72:41.09]Okay.
[72:46.75]One of the first settlers had a pocket watch of set quality.
[72:49.13]Let's just go to one, right?
[72:50.60]Let's just do it.
[72:51.86]I'm gonna go... Look, I can buy... I got a limited amount of money.
[72:58.44]I can do the quest later.
[73:03.57]Let's go meet Jesus.
[73:09.50]Okay.
[73:11.52]Back then, the Park Hill was our estate.
[73:13.88]And he lived just next to it.
[73:17.42]You never told me this story.
[73:19.38]I did just now.
[73:20.30]Alright.
[73:21.80]Okay, let's do it.
[73:28.51]Yeah, yeah.
[73:29.09]Like you've never seen a fucking time travel machine before.
[73:34.51]Car flipper?
[73:44.18]Do I have a map?
[74:01.53]Am I flying?
[74:18.68]My god, I can't do that!
[74:26.60]That's not fair!
[74:28.56]That's bullshit!
[74:31.04]I'm from the past man.
[74:34.69]I don't understand this stuff.
[74:37.21]Why am I stuck?
[74:42.61]Yes, it can.
[74:47.44]I'm actually stuck.
[74:59.00]Use the car flipper?
[75:04.26]I'm gonna fall off again.
[75:06.23]Go out the other door.
[75:09.23]What the fuck have I done?
[75:10.39]I'm gonna fall off again.
[75:11.95]And this time I'm probably gonna die.
[75:12.99]I think I can get out eventually.
[75:17.99]I'm just loading the game.
[75:19.51]Here.
[75:19.75]Here's real time travel for you.
[75:22.25]I'm loading this save file.
[75:27.85]Done.
[75:34.29]Okay.
[75:37.69]Let's load up the car.
[76:00.34]I'm not going to use it.
[76:00.90]I just want to make sure it's in there.
[76:04.96]Okay, let's go.
[76:11.24]What are you guys doing?
[76:13.40]So should I go... I gotta go to the northern end of this area.
[76:19.90]There's two or three quests.
[76:25.33]I can go get the stuff for that guy.
[76:30.49]What is that?
[76:31.07]Okay.
[76:32.61]Okay.
[76:34.42]His heirloom brass clock from 1795.
[76:39.22]Uranium from 612.
[76:40.10]Okay, let's go to 1795.
[76:42.65]Go to year one.
[76:43.25]You said one.
[77:09.91]Let's go.
[77:10.39]Fine.
[77:16.39]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[77:26.43]Where are my headlights?
[78:00.40]Whatever, shut up.
[78:01.86]I just got a little startled.
[78:08.16]Where's Jesus?
[78:10.64]Jesus?
[78:14.86]Jesus, I have a lot of important stuff to tell you.
[78:16.78]Can I get lost?
[78:32.77]I can't see anything.
[78:36.73]Were there snow in 1 AD?
[78:40.17]Don't you feel like all this stuff shouldn't be here?
[78:42.79]I know that's not that far away, but it kind of feels like it should be, right?
[78:46.24]I feel like there wasn't grass.
[78:48.46]Think about that, right?
[78:49.36]I feel like there wasn't grass in like 600 million BC.
[78:55.96]Isn't that weird to think about?
[79:00.99]I'll drive around for a minute.
[79:13.85]NA education?
[79:14.57]No, I know that it existed.
[79:15.55]I'm just saying it's weird to think about.
[79:16.93]I keep taking this fucking thing out and I'm an idiot.
[79:25.94]I'm going to start holding onto these.
[79:27.08]Because if I go back in time, maybe it'll be Phil again.
[79:29.60]Alright.
[79:35.00]I'm going to drive around for a little bit.
[79:38.00]Do I have my... Where are my headlights?
[79:39.35]Okay, they're on.
[79:41.09]Are they on?
[79:42.87]I can't... I really can't tell.
[80:05.68]Oh my god.
[80:11.22]Where are my headlights?
[80:13.83]There we go.
[80:39.88]I guess it's really not that interesting.
[80:44.71]What would be so interesting here?
[80:48.67]It's just outside.
[80:50.07]That's it.
[80:53.57]I don't know what everyone was expecting.
[80:57.65]It's just outside.
[81:03.95]Even if there were dinosaurs or even if there were other animals, it'd probably be pretty hard to find them.
[81:12.55]Even right now... Wait a minute.
[81:14.53]Wait a minute.
[81:14.89]There's a structure here.
[81:15.75]What's going on?
[81:16.23]What is this?
[81:16.59]Okay, if you walked into the woods right now, and your goal was, I'm going to find a bear.
[81:37.72]You probably wouldn't.
[81:39.74]That's just not going to happen.
[81:44.22]There's so much surface area, they could be anywhere.
[81:49.98]They could be anywhere.
[81:56.92]It would take, like, hours, potentially, to find one.
[82:03.73]At least an hour, which I'm not giving it more than an hour to look for a dinosaur.
[82:11.39]The airbag just fucking hits me in the face.
[82:18.00]I'm just unconscious.
[82:20.36]How would this change the course of human history?
[82:26.88]Because there's nuclear shit in here.
[82:31.88]Somebody would find this, and I would change the complete course of all history.
[82:44.63]120 FOV Andy.
[82:47.45]What's wrong with that?
[82:48.35]Is this water?
[83:05.00]I thought this was slate.
[83:17.26]Okay.
[83:27.25]Let's go to, like, 9999?
[83:28.57]No, not- that's too easy.
[83:38.77]Let's go somewhere weird.
[83:51.63]I don't want to go to 1 and then 9, 9, 9, 9.
[83:53.53]Okay?
[83:57.60]I'll go to 23, 23.
[83:58.46]That sounds fun.
[84:00.64]And I just said to not do that number, but whatever.
[84:02.88]We're here.
[84:03.26]Okay, here we go.
[84:12.11]Okay.
[84:12.65]Let's go to... 12.
[84:13.31]25. 25.
[84:35.50]At, I don't know, somewhere in like the evening.
[84:41.22]Let's go.
[84:54.50]My FOV is not 120, it's 90.
[85:12.10]Oh no!
[85:15.66]Civilization!
[85:19.99]What happened?
[85:23.50]No, this is a bad- This is not a good Christmas.
[85:25.54]25... Wait, what?
[85:33.12]This thing bugged.
[85:35.28]I don't- The difference between 1 AD and 25 AD is not that long.
[85:42.36]I didn't type it in wrong.
[85:45.82]What?
[85:48.32]What happened?
[85:56.62]I did not type that in wrong.
[85:58.69]Was it a typo?
[86:13.15]It's set for December 25th, 1225.
[86:14.23]The maximum is 2030.
[86:14.69]Oh, that's right.
[86:19.92]So...
[86:28.61]Oh this sucks Christmas doesn't exist in 2525 whatever
[86:56.54]I didn't cool it off.
[86:57.74]Oh, whatever.
[86:58.90]Civilization didn't exist anymore.
[87:00.32]Alright, I want to go... Okay, I'm going to put it all by favorite numbers.
[87:06.92]You ready?
[87:08.64]What are some of my favorite numbers?
[87:09.66]Okay, I like... I like 10.
[87:14.04]I also like... I like 7.
[87:22.52]And then think of a few digits.
[87:24.10]What's some of my favorite numbers?
[87:26.67]I like the number... 10?
[87:28.51]No, I like the number 5.
[87:29.51]I like 5.
[87:36.24]I also like... 3.
[87:43.14]I also like... 7.
[87:45.74]No, I like... 7?
[87:50.18]Okay, I also like the number 10.
[87:53.33]I also like the number 5.
[87:57.95]Let's go.
[88:24.80]Okay.
[88:27.06]Where we at?
[88:30.81]540?
[88:30.87]Like year 537?
[88:31.77]Holy shit, that probably was really loud.
[88:39.80]I just... Whatever.
[88:43.33]This is the Middle Ages?
[88:45.53]So this is probably like a town, right?
[88:48.83]Should I just look for a town?
[89:04.35]I'm gonna find a settlement.
[89:05.41]I'm gonna run around screaming.
[89:08.75]You'll never be the same!
[89:10.08]You'll never be the same!
[89:11.40]None of you will ever be the same!
[89:15.48]I'm gonna go like this with a lighter.
[89:20.01]Then I'm gonna show my phone to everybody.
[89:21.57]I'm gonna go like this and I'm gonna leave.
[89:37.88]Settlement?
[89:38.36]No.
[89:56.78]God, the world was really boring before fucking Twitter, huh?
[90:12.49]This is in the middle of nowhere in Arizona.
[90:15.29]Check your world map.
[90:17.55]Do I have a world map?
[90:24.55]M?
[90:28.43]World map.
[90:31.25]Ancient ruins?
[90:34.51]Guys, there's ancient ruins.
[90:38.55]How do I get here?
[90:48.52]Oh my god.
[90:49.32]Alright.
[90:50.34]Fuck everything else.
[90:51.40]We're going to the ancient ruins.
[90:54.61]Shit.
[90:54.95]Alright.
[90:55.39]So I gotta turn around and go this way.
[91:02.63]So just turn the car completely around and just drive this way.
[91:05.19]Alright.
[91:08.26]This is cool.
[91:08.72]I'm very excited now.
[91:09.58]Let's go.
[91:28.92]Maybe I'll run into some people.
[91:37.45]Don't drive into the lake?
[91:38.31]I'm not going to drive into the lake.
[91:40.39]Not again.
[91:40.71]Alright, don't go 100 miles per hour.
[91:55.32]I'm being stupid.
[91:58.64]Alright, this pine lake.
[92:00.98]Old forest.
[92:02.95]Where are the... Wait, weren't there ruins?
[92:06.43]What happened to the ancient ruins?
[92:09.43]They're gone.
[92:10.17]There's no ancient ruins anymore.
[92:12.09]Lower your FOV?
[92:13.31]It's not that high.
[92:15.22]It's literally 90.
[92:20.62]What do you want it at?
[92:47.54]It's the first ever McDonald's.
[93:06.81]What actually is this?
[93:09.41]Is this a tree?
[93:13.05]Why is there a tree made out of weird banana leaves?
[93:15.20]What is this?
[93:17.35]Should I take a sample or something?
[93:31.85]That's kind of... weird.
[93:35.01]This is tar?
[93:38.41]Were there really tar pits like this?
[93:42.09]At five... six hundred AD?
[93:51.44]I don't know why, but a big tar pit to me sounds like it should be a long time ago.
[94:05.15]Something right here.
[94:12.06]What the fuck?
[94:15.24]There was just like a settlement.
[94:16.74]Alright, where are those runes?
[94:21.18]There's the lake.
[94:21.84]Old Forest.
[94:22.58]Let's go to Old Forest.
[94:26.96]Why don't... Just please go to AD 69.
[94:28.88]I'm thinking about it.
[94:33.22]Alright.
[94:44.07]Old Forest?
[94:46.01]I think I'm there.
[94:46.53]Yeah.
[94:49.83]Ancient Runes.
[95:14.54]Stop!
[95:15.62]Oh my god!
[95:16.54]I think I'm gonna get on foot.
[95:33.14]So I don't smash up the car.
[95:48.05]It says they were here.
[95:48.79]What's that?
[95:56.17]There's an animal!
[96:16.59]Any supplies or anything?
[96:26.55]Where is anything?
[96:28.05]Wait, now travel from here.
[96:29.61]Oh, wait a minute.
[96:40.94]Dude, if I travel right here and I go either back or forward... This is cool.
[96:47.77]I'm actually into this.
[96:55.64]Alright, let's go.
[96:56.16]Let's go forward, what, a couple hundred years?
[96:57.80]Or go backwards a hundred years?
[97:05.00]Is this the ancient site?
[97:06.04]I would imagine it is, right?
[97:07.32]It kind of has to be.
[97:09.58]It says it's, like, here.
[97:13.02]Yeah, these are ancient ruins, which means, like, two or three hundred years ago.
[97:16.92]Let's do it.
[97:18.16]I'm going to save the game, because I want to make sure I don't get this... I want unlimited... I want to explore.
[97:22.83]I don't want to do the quests.
[97:33.01]Only two or three hundred?
[97:34.31]What do you mean?
[97:36.87]I'm almost out.
[97:38.45]Go to three hundred?
[97:45.48]Will that be there when I come back?
[97:49.70]Okay.
[97:52.94]Alright, you guys ready?
[97:53.86]We're gonna find out who this ancient civilization was.
[97:58.31]So we're gonna go back a hundred years ago.
[98:01.41]October 7th.
[98:09.63]Or, I mean, September, whatever.
[98:12.38]Let's go to September 7.
[98:13.34]Zero... 200?
[98:15.32]Zero 100?
[98:15.98]100 years, dude, is barely one generation.
[98:22.30]But, you know what I mean?
[98:23.50]Let's go 100?
[98:24.04]Well, like, I don't know.
[98:25.18]20?
[98:25.20]50?
[98:25.22]I'm gonna try 50 AD.
[98:26.24]Let's go.
[98:44.15]Not enough speed.
[98:57.36]I'm just doing donuts at the ancient site!
[99:09.18]Whatever, I'm just gonna go this way.
[99:13.64]I didn't hit enter?
[99:14.28]That should have been like BOOM!
[99:21.24]It disappeared.
[99:21.98]I just fucking left here.
[99:25.06]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[99:26.49]Yes, I did!
[99:27.05]I hit enter.
[99:27.59]I don't know, 5 AM?
[99:37.37]There.
[99:48.13]What the hell was that?
[100:05.24]Come on, I gotta get speed.
[100:18.29]All right, all right, all right.
[100:19.27]I'm good, I'm good.
[100:20.01]Uh-oh.
[100:40.93]All right, let's go back to that place and see what's going on.
[100:50.83]Get these fucking trees!
[100:52.55]Oh, I'm so mad right now.
[101:05.88]Okay, am I gonna bang a right?
[101:11.07]Why is it so weird looking?
[101:12.23]Why is it so green?
[101:28.61]There it is.
[101:28.92]Alright.
[102:02.51]Humans have been around for 250,000 years.
[102:05.11]I can't... I can't go back that far.
[102:21.54]Go negative?
[102:30.98]I can only do 0, 0, 0.
[102:33.67]Alright, let me load it.
[102:34.35]I'm going to go forward and see what happens.
[102:38.05]Go BC?
[102:38.89]I can't.
[102:39.59]I don't think I can.
[102:42.69]Yeah, it's only AD right now.
[102:47.52]1 AD would have it, maybe?
[102:48.48]Yeah, I can only go to 1.
[102:58.22]I want to see what happens in the future.
[102:59.80]So what do we think?
[103:00.74]Maybe like 1,000?
[103:01.10]Like 1,200 AD?
[103:01.54]1,000 AD?
[103:09.90]do the quest.
[103:11.06]Alright, I'll do the quest, but I just want to do this one more time.
[103:13.28]Let me load the game.
[103:16.10]Because I want to see if anything actually changes here.
[103:17.66]Does that be cool if it did?
[103:23.61]Yeah, I'm going to lap my ass off if the ruins are the exact same and it's like the year 2000.
[103:27.19]Okay, here we go.
[103:34.58]I think I need to put the...
[103:39.93]I can't leave the car.
[103:51.28]Stop doing that!
[103:52.10]Alright, after this we'll do the quest.
[103:58.17]I just want to see if it was possible.
[104:00.27]Alright.
[104:01.27]We're gonna go to... Um... Twelve...
[104:10.12]Ten... Okay, what?
[104:13.04]Fifteen hundred?
[104:13.68]Two thousand?
[104:15.51]Fifteen hundred.
[104:18.41]At... During the day.
[104:20.27]So, like, noon.
[104:23.45]You think that's good?
[104:26.76]Let's try it.
[104:41.61]Oh, come on!
[105:21.78]We didn't go yet, no.
[105:27.78]Although I could pretend if you were in the car here.
[105:30.30]Get out and look around and then see if you'd, you know, oh, hey, yeah, look how different everything is and see if you're like, holy shit, wow, is everything so different?
[105:46.01]Just drive around in a circle five times and tell somebody you actually time traveled.
[105:50.59]Okay.
[105:50.71]Okay.
[105:52.80]It's gotta get under 300.
[105:54.22]And then I can go.
[105:57.91]Can we get ice cream?
[106:00.69]If you're good and you haven't been very good.
[106:27.57]It's a fucking dinosaur!
[106:33.47]I'm in the car!
[106:34.65]I'm in the car!
[106:35.87]What are you talking about?
[106:36.89]I'm literally in the car!
[106:54.96]Did I kill him?
[106:56.32]Did I kill him?
[106:57.72]I don't know if I killed him.
[106:59.86]I'm sure that won't affect anything.
[107:07.63]Why can't I kill it?
[107:08.65]I can't.
[107:17.75]I don't think I can kill it.
[107:25.21]Wait!
[107:26.11]I come in peace!
[107:26.99]I have a cheeseburger in the backseat!
[107:30.43]No, I don't.
[107:38.45]Okay, if I fed this weird alien creature a cheeseburger, would it change genetic makeup throughout all of history of animals?
[107:55.72]What the fuck is happening?
[108:08.39]Like, what do I need to use?
[108:23.80]Let's go!
[108:24.18]No, I didn't mean to punch.
[108:32.79]Can I ride it?
[108:33.33]I think I bugged it out when it went into the car.
[108:37.93]I want to bring it with me.
[108:58.82]I'm trying to put him in the car.
[109:01.92]Come on, get in the car.
[109:03.06]Get in the car.
[109:03.64]There's a bunch of scientists that definitely want to see you.
[109:45.31]Alright, what about... Fuck you guys, I'm going to 1500 AD.
[109:52.56]See you later.
[109:54.44]Have fun with the fucking meteor!
[110:13.00]Alright, we're at 1500.
[110:29.10]Let's go check it out.
[110:33.82]I have to bring the car, man.
[110:38.80]Quick, dude.
[110:39.39]Make Among Us before the other people do.
[110:43.99]You don't understand.
[110:44.67]If I made Among Us, it wouldn't be successful.
[110:47.46]Nobody would play it.
[110:49.56]No, it doesn't work like that.
[110:56.95]My Among Us would be just barely, slightly different.
[111:01.13]And it would not take off.
[111:03.89]You should go... That's the idea...
[111:10.02]What, so I go back and make Among Us and make it shitty, so then nobody cares about it?
[111:15.96]You guys really don't like that game.
[111:19.93]Of all the things we could change in all history, you want me to go back and make sure Among Us is not popular?
[111:24.93]Okay.
[111:38.10]This is a fun game!
[111:38.92]What's wrong with you?
[111:39.52]Alright.
[111:41.34]So this is 1500 A.D.
[111:43.00]It's been about a thousand years.
[111:46.88]Here we are.
[111:48.28]What does civilization look like?
[111:54.76]Why is it so radioactive here?
[111:59.30]Everything's radiated.
[112:05.55]Have I been doing it too much here?
[112:10.07]I've been traveling through time in this one location too many times that I've... I've irradiated the... Is nobody here?
[112:23.81]Holy shit, the whole world is green.
[112:25.77]What did I do?
[112:31.15]Too many times in the same spot?
[113:31.84]Oh shit.
[113:33.54]Oh my god.
[113:37.06]What's happening?
[113:42.90]It's even worse.
[113:44.50]What is happening to the world?
[114:20.22]What happened?
[114:22.52]I've ruined civilization.
[114:25.62]I just wanted to see if there were any people in these houses.
[114:28.52]I fucked up everything.
[114:34.88]Wait, what if I go to the... What if I just go to... Okay, wait a minute.
[114:39.87]It's the year 2000.
[114:40.27]What if I just go to one of these stores?
[114:44.17]Did I really ruin everything?
[114:47.51]I'm going to just drive this way.
[114:50.25]Did I fuck up the whole world?
[114:51.11]Do I have to restart the whole game?
[114:53.55]I'm going to go touch that.
[114:54.41]I'm going to put my face in that.
[115:00.61]You never know, guys.
[115:01.13]It could be like the Matrix.
[115:03.21]I might put my head in here and know how to fly a helicopter.
[115:12.74]What?
[115:24.39]It was a collectible.
[115:33.63]Oh my fucking god.
[115:34.99]Did I seriously just kill myself?
[115:55.37]That's so fucking dumb.
[115:56.57]Alright.
[115:59.15]Alright, I'm gonna go back.
[116:01.17]I think I fucked up a lot of stuff here.
[116:04.42]Let me just see.
[116:07.54]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[116:08.70]There's nobody here.
[116:10.10]There's no civilization here.
[116:12.87]There's just these squares with holes in them.
[116:14.41]That's it.
[116:19.11]Derma fucking hates the Lorax.
[116:20.89]I've never seen that movie and I've never read the book.
[116:22.65]I don't know what it is.
[116:23.45]I just know Danny DeVito is the main character.
[116:35.27]I want to go here.
[116:36.73]We're going to check one thing.
[116:38.57]I'm going to do the mission, but I got to turn this way because this is where the town is.
[116:44.42]I'm going up there.
[116:50.52]I give off Lorax vibes.
[116:54.20]What does that mean?
[117:03.23]I don't know what that means.
[117:04.25]You have to elaborate.
[117:05.13]I don't know what you're talking about.
[117:14.37]Okay.
[117:14.63]So it's 537.
[117:17.03]That's the year.
[117:26.09]Droppings.
[117:29.07]Some kind of droppings over there.
[117:35.03]Okay, now I gotta bang a left.
[117:39.28]He's short and orange.
[117:50.67]I mean, I am kind of orange today.
[117:54.55]I'm not wearing concealer, no.
[117:57.32]I am a little orange, you're right.
[118:03.55]This is a good place to do it, because I want to go to the... I'm going to save it.
[118:08.43]We're going to go to the year 2000.
[118:09.19]We're going to go to the year 2000.
[118:11.83]No, we're not.
[118:16.20]What do I want to do?
[118:22.46]It was a bank robbery in Pine Lake during the 1870s.
[118:27.93]Supposedly, this led Westwood discovering the secret hideout of some 20 bandits.
[118:34.26]The courthouse archives in Pine Lake supposedly have a document on it.
[118:37.29]All right.
[118:39.43]I'm just going to time travel again and load, like, save number one, whatever it was.
[118:43.25]Because I'm interested in that.
[118:45.27]I want to know what that means.
[118:48.35]This one here.
[118:51.24]Drink some more water.
[118:51.98]I got it right here.
[118:52.58]What do you think this is?
[118:59.70]Yeah.
[118:59.94]All right.
[119:00.16]So this puts us back here.
[119:01.14]Let's go to the archives.
[119:02.36]I want to look at that up.
[119:07.53]I need the city archives.
[119:15.72]This looks like a city building.
[119:28.06]This time, don't dump nuclear waste everywhere.
[119:34.66]I didn't.
[119:34.90]It was empty.
[119:44.29]Alright, this 612 store has it.
[119:48.11]But where do... It said to go up, right?
[119:54.94]Cape Dunn.
[119:58.72]That's for the other guy.
[119:59.60]The old guy that used to be our friend.
[120:02.84]I want to do the 1800s one.
[120:08.57]So I need to go to the city archive?
[120:10.37]I don't know where that is.
[120:11.87]It's probably here, right?
[120:20.90]Recycling station?
[120:22.92]Who's talking to me?
[120:35.55]Alright, I need the... I need the courthouse or something.
[120:38.49]Wait, what do you have?
[120:42.84]Huh, yes?
[120:43.62]Why are you sad?
[120:44.14]Ah, well, I don't know if I should even tell at this point.
[120:47.22]It was about her.
[120:51.14]Yeah.
[120:52.34]Well, Sandy, she works in that ice cream shop just across the square.
[120:57.58]lowers his voice.
[120:58.82]I mean, yes, I want to ask her out.
[121:01.08]Why don't you just ask her out?
[121:02.72]I thought about making a nice present of sorts that would fit her.
[121:05.53]Okay.
[121:09.17]A flower.
[121:11.15]Just one flower.
[121:12.45]No, it's a special one.
[121:13.19]It's called the Eleanor.
[121:17.14]Seemingly, everybody tells me I should stop dreaming.
[121:18.92]This particular plant is extinct for hundreds of years now.
[121:21.98]I know I can find one.
[121:22.78]I'll have to search really, really hard.
[121:30.70]Am I really going to go back in time and pick a flower for this guy?
[121:43.10]Sure.
[121:44.24]Yeah, I can help.
[121:46.38]Okay.
[121:49.02]Look at the bookstore.
[121:49.62]Okay, I think you can look at the bookstore just next to the mechanic.
[121:52.63]Get that flower book and see if it can help you.
[121:56.66]I want to go do the bandit thing.
[121:58.18]Alright, no, no, no.
[122:00.72]I want the courthouse.
[122:03.66]I need that map to show me where the courthouse is.
[122:07.50]Fucking burping and you can hear it.
[122:09.84]I hate that.
[122:17.16]Do the flower plot line.
[122:18.52]No, that's boring.
[122:22.54]I'm going to go fight the bandits.
[122:58.89]I'm not hitting the tree.
[123:14.58]Okay.
[123:16.80]Town square.
[123:17.44]It's probably where the statue was, right?
[123:21.96]I'm going to assume.
[123:25.42]That statue is over here.
[123:37.87]Oh, information.
[123:47.94]This is definitely it.
[123:48.70]100%.
[123:49.28]Okay.
[123:58.89]Post office.
[123:59.91]Archives.
[124:00.39]There it is.
[124:13.65]Why is that a health bar on the screen?
[124:21.21]Okay, Mrs. Nice.
[124:23.57]I'm looking for info on the robbery that happened.
[124:27.09]Never mind.
[124:27.43]You're not going to help me.
[124:29.47]A new life awaits you in the Flying Colors.
[124:33.00]The chance to begin again in a robbery full of opportunity and adventure.
[124:44.24]Oh, shit.
[124:47.26]After a lengthy interrogation, I managed to deduct that the thieves have been hiding underneath the well-known waterfall in the west.
[124:55.31]That's when I ambushed and defeated the 20 bandits and their boss.
[124:59.25]My new friend helped me in the ambush by his clever distraction.
[125:03.76]I recovered a load of redacted material from the cave.
[125:07.12]All the captured bandits are to be relocated to Isla de los Tontos, charged for robbery.
[125:15.80]By the speedy aid of my friend... This is... They're talking about me.
[125:22.59]There was a minor altercation afterwards with... ...Diango's gang.
[125:27.43]They tried to steal our recovered goods from the bank.
[125:29.49]They weren't much of a problem.
[125:30.37]I suggest also moving them to Isla de los Tontos, charge for... Okay.
[125:33.27]So this is 1871.
[125:38.72]1871.
[125:39.02]The robbery at Pine Island National Bank occurred March 15th, 1871 at 1.20pm.
[125:51.31]So we should go there at 12?
[125:52.85]And just wait?
[126:03.32]Write that down.
[126:03.80]Yeah, write it down for me.
[126:07.76]That happened at the well.
[126:08.72]Alright.
[126:10.46]12 o'clock.
[126:11.14]March 15th, 1871.
[126:12.72]12 o'clock.
[126:14.08]Pine Island National Bank.
[126:16.18]Write it down.
[126:21.68]Let's go.
[126:35.07]You write it down.
[126:35.71]I can't.
[126:36.15]My hands are occupied.
[126:46.11]Alright.
[126:47.21]Where's the bank?
[126:50.05]Fuck.
[126:50.25]Where's the bank?
[126:51.91]I need to know where the bank is.
[127:15.43]Park?
[127:17.70]Train station?
[127:18.40]It's not on here.
[127:19.78]I have to find it.
[127:27.28]I know you have a quest, but fine.
[127:28.64]What is it?
[127:30.86]Any rumors?
[127:31.48]I heard back in the 70s there was this accordion man who you would not want to meet at nights in the forest.
[127:39.83]I suppose you could try it in the town archives.
[127:41.43]I don't care about the accordion man.
[127:45.57]Where's the bank?
[127:50.35]Ice cream.
[127:55.67]Where's the bank?
[127:56.25]Is this a bank?
[127:59.62]No, it's like a recycling center.
[128:00.76]Where's the bank?
[128:03.08]Books.
[128:07.36]Hoverboards.
[128:11.25]I don't know.
[128:15.05]I'm not doing accordion, man.
[128:16.85]I don't want to do that right now.
[128:28.68]By zooming, will it say?
[128:38.62]Do it after the bank?
[128:40.18]Maybe.
[128:44.14]You didn't read Homestuck.
[128:46.42]What does it have to do with anything?
[128:51.00]This is not a bank.
[128:51.82]This is a library.
[129:00.84]There's the lab.
[129:01.58]Where's this fucking bank?
[129:05.90]Okay.
[129:17.59]Bank time.
[129:18.97]So, this is where I need to be.
[129:21.01]I'm gonna get here at noon.
[129:21.83]Let me look at the map, because literally I'll mess this up.
[129:29.47]Alright, it is right below that Pine Lake thing.
[129:34.20]Right below it, kind of to the southwestern area.
[129:36.90]Right next to the ice cream shop.
[129:38.28]Let's go.
[129:38.52]Alright, where's the car?
[129:45.56]Over here?
[129:46.48]Alright, I'm just going to drive down this street.
[129:51.48]And I'm going to get there at noon.
[129:52.46]We'll be there about an hour early for me to stop the robbery.
[130:02.17]You're disgusting!
[130:02.99]Why would you say something weird like that?
[130:05.57]Alright, here we go.
[130:06.83]Get in.
[130:07.49]I'm ready.
[130:19.46]Let's do it.
[130:23.46]What was the date again?
[130:24.15]It was something... Something... It was March?
[130:35.49]3-15.
[130:35.99]Um.
[130:36.41]No.
[130:41.35]What are you... Okay.
[130:52.74]3?
[130:56.70]I'm trying to do the fucking month!
[130:58.40]What do I do?
[130:59.96]0-0-3?
[131:03.91]What is going on right now?
[131:07.92]It won't accept 03.
[131:08.42]03.
[131:08.90]I just did that three times.
[131:14.31]03.
[131:17.35]Stop giving random dates.
[131:18.77]1871 at 12 noon.
[131:25.59]Let's go for it.
[131:28.15]Let's fucking do it.
[131:28.77]Let's get to the bank.
[131:46.47]I need a better straightaway.
[131:47.73]There we go.
[132:15.50]What even happened?
[132:17.26]Too much juice?
[132:37.54]Alright, they're gonna rob the bank.
[132:39.80]Turn that off, turn that off, turn it off.
[132:42.67]Alright, they're going to rob the bank in... an hour.
[132:49.16]I want to sell my... No.
[132:50.62]What do I do?
[132:50.98]How do I stop them?
[132:58.62]What do I do?
[133:31.98]Anybody suspicious?
[133:32.68]Do I have like a weapon or anything?
[133:44.64]Go tell the sheriff?
[133:48.02]Sheriff!
[133:48.86]Sheriff!
[133:49.46]Listen to me!
[133:52.43]Am I too late?
[133:58.69]What exploded?
[134:01.80]What did I just do?
[134:04.04]I didn't just blow up the bank.
[134:06.89]Get out of the fucking way.
[134:07.91]Sheriff.
[134:09.03]Sheriff.
[134:11.29]Everything's safe.
[134:12.01]No, it's not safe.
[134:13.51]Oh my God.
[134:14.21]What time is it?
[134:24.17]Wait, they already robbed it?
[134:25.17]Is that them robbing the bank?
[134:32.51]What?!
[134:32.75]I did it!
[135:02.38]Why were they coming out of my car as if I brought them here?
[135:08.02]I backed up the car into the bank and they all started getting out of the car.
[135:18.80]Everybody wants to rob it.
[135:37.15]okay um so I went to wait what oh it's an auto save I'm getting in the car should I get a gun
[136:06.89]They haven't robbed it yet.
[136:23.75]Why did the month and day change?
[136:27.71]What?
[136:27.89]Throw uranium at them.
[136:39.87]Year 2000?
[136:40.65]Wait, what's going on?
[136:47.28]How come the dates are different?
[136:53.41]I'm so confused.
[136:54.09]Oh, okay.
[136:54.45]120.
[136:54.53]I'm ready.
[137:17.02]Oh my god, that's too far.
[137:20.74]Go talk to the sheriff?
[137:21.52]I tried to talk to the sheriff and he didn't have anything to say.
[137:23.50]He just said, oh, alright.
[137:28.75]There's no options.
[137:34.85]Here we go.
[137:35.79]That wasn't the sheriff?
[137:36.69]Why was he standing behind the counter?
[137:58.86]I can't... I can't interact with them.
[138:01.55]Sorry.
[138:08.21]What fucking time is it?
[138:09.41]What?
[138:09.65]13... Oh, right.
[138:11.77]It's not a regular clock.
[138:13.23]It's a 20...
[138:42.59]Kind of works.
[138:47.77]Ten- five minutes and then another wave.
[139:10.45]Excuse me?
[139:11.75]Excuse me?
[139:12.47]Turn- The car won't turn on.
[139:20.52]What?
[139:22.84]You can't be fucking serious.
[139:24.43]Why is it so dark?
[139:39.30]Why did the fucking car turn off?
[139:42.02]I'm getting a gun.
[139:45.10]What is that?
[139:46.22]Did I run out of gas?
[139:53.13]I don't know what happened.
[139:55.73]I need to go get a weapon or something.
[139:56.83]$4 back in the 1800s is like $50 million, so I'll be fine.
[140:09.35]Two bucks?
[140:10.43]What are you... I don't think I can get a gun.
[140:30.54]So how am I supposed to... There's a lot of people that come in.
[140:33.68]Can I get like a melee weapon?
[140:36.58]Blacksmith, here we go.
[140:40.22]Can I buy something?
[140:41.08]Ooh, revolver parts.
[140:47.38]Okay.
[140:49.43]20 bucks.
[140:49.79]I need money.
[141:14.81]Motherfucker.
[141:15.57]I gotta go back in time again.
[141:17.01]I gotta go find gold or something.
[141:18.15]Go back another... Oh my god.
[141:21.82]I gotta go back like three days and find gold and sell it.
[141:32.58]I gotta find gold here.
[141:37.75]You should just rob the bank.
[141:47.49]Okay, I... No!
[141:52.55]There's gotta be gold, right?
[141:56.12]Rob the bank and then travel back in time and pay with the stolen money.
[142:00.52]But wouldn't I always rob the bank if I kept going back?
[142:33.98]Don't you have a bank to rob?
[142:35.24]Why is everybody chasing me?
[142:51.63]They're not robbing the bank.
[142:52.97]I'm preventing the bank robbery.
[143:09.85]They're shooting each other.
[144:05.70]I think if I wrap around and eat a barbecue sandwich, I think I'll be fine.
[144:07.96]Where's the barbecue place?
[144:40.01]Get out of here.
[144:40.99]There's people attacking town.
[144:50.96]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[144:58.96]Quick, quick, quick, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[145:01.26]No, I want to order a barbecue.
[145:03.42]I want to order a sandwich.
[145:06.35]I can't have a barbecue?
[145:08.08]This is the barbecue place, right?
[145:10.34]What's going on?
[145:11.24]Barbecue, get out of here.
[145:19.56]Fuck.
[145:19.86]Where are they going?
[145:25.74]Bill Banker said, what was that?
[145:28.28]Bill, have you not been paying attention this entire time?
[145:32.28]Where's the gold?
[145:39.18]My gold!
[145:40.12]I guess I have to open up the reserves in the bunker.
[145:43.23]Wait.
[145:44.33]Why does the sheriff not have a gun?
[145:47.79]The sheriff doesn't have a gun?
[145:50.71]This is fucked up.
[145:57.67]He's just running around like...
[146:12.94]I have to hide the car?
[146:14.16]These are the Time Police?
[146:16.66]Why are they... They're not the Time Police?
[146:21.74]They're Time Agents.
[146:24.82]What are you talking about?
[146:26.58]They're... Time Agents?
[146:39.84]I'm so confused.
[146:45.56]Let me bully you?
[146:47.44]Wait, what?
[146:53.15]Why did they kill that guy?
[146:55.81]What's happening?
[146:59.67]Why?
[147:00.13]They're dressed like they're from this time period.
[147:03.01]Alright.
[147:03.35]Okay, hide the car.
[147:08.49]I'm gonna hide the car.
[147:09.15]I'm gonna hide the car.
[147:09.77]Hide the car.
[147:10.13]Hide the car.
[147:11.71]I thought that was an entire group of people coming to get me.
[147:15.03]That they are dressed with... They have like... They have bandit masks.
[147:19.42]What do you mean?
[147:20.08]They're time agents?
[147:24.87]Get the car out of the way.
[147:25.53]Hide it.
[147:52.82]Okay, here we go.
[147:56.74]They're trying to blend in.
[147:58.98]Okay, Bill Banker.
[148:01.02]What do you have?
[148:02.00]Buy a dollar for 210 coins.
[148:06.32]Buy 100 gold for 100... I can't even look at that.
[148:10.82]My head hurts looking at it.
[148:13.49]Alright, now I gotta protect it.
[148:28.05]Fucking time agents.
[148:29.09]I thought they were bank robbers.
[148:31.45]What time is it?
[148:39.38]Alright, they'll be here any minute.
[148:43.04]I don't know what time it is because my fucking car is over there in a ditch.
[148:46.09]So I don't know what time it is.
[149:06.06]Oh, okay, cool.
[149:11.23]Alright, they're gonna come in a minute.
[150:04.24]What is this game?
[150:04.70]The game is called No Time.
[150:06.36]It is on Steam.
[150:07.34]It's early access.
[150:10.12]I think it's actually really fun.
[150:12.88]I am confused about it a few times, though.
[150:16.18]Once you get used to it.
[150:18.64]I think this is really cool.
[150:19.40]This is a really great idea.
[150:26.70]Alright, they should be coming any second now.
[150:34.01]Yep, here they come.
[150:36.70]From what direction did they come, though?
[150:45.10]What a beautiful day.
[150:45.80]Bill Banker.
[150:48.30]Yep.
[150:49.84]What?!
[150:51.98]Go, go, go!
[150:53.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[150:54.11]What's going on?
[151:00.41]UGH!
[151:16.08]Why was he already in there?
[151:17.40]I need a fucking gun.
[151:23.20]I'm so red.
[151:28.13]I'm so sick and fucking tired of waiting.
[151:29.91]I'm not waiting anymore.
[151:31.19]Just get in the car.
[151:32.83]No, get out now.
[151:34.05]I'm going.
[151:34.45]I don't care.
[151:35.59]Pull me back.
[151:36.43]Take this fucking thing out.
[151:43.55]Time agents.
[151:46.72]I'll show you how we're gonna handle this.
[152:13.77]No, not 11.
[152:14.97]No, not 11.50.
[152:17.35]You piece of shit.
[152:20.92]No, not March.
[152:33.36]Why can't I do 1.15?
[152:35.75]1.0.1.
[152:37.87]At this point, it's already... Just give me a fucking calendar.
[152:45.62]I don't care.
[152:59.19]I'm not waiting.
[153:07.33]I want to see if this works, actually.
[153:11.36]I'm testing something.
[153:22.12]It doesn't work.
[153:22.72]Fuck it.
[153:23.06]Never mind.
[153:24.02]Reload the game.
[153:24.70]Reload the game.
[153:25.32]Reload the game.
[153:25.84]I was trying to... I was trying to send it and just not even be in it.
[153:48.79]Okay.
[153:52.48]How come the trunk is closed?
[153:54.96]All right.
[153:56.00]I guess the correct way to do this is to get a gun.
[154:00.52]Right?
[154:02.72]We're going to find a job.
[154:03.76]The blacksmith pays well.
[154:07.27]Really?
[154:08.11]Wait, I can work there?
[154:11.95]Need help?
[154:13.61]Grill steaks.
[154:18.67]Holy shit.
[154:19.13]Okay, cool.
[154:21.92]Prepare the steaks on the grill.
[154:23.02]Take an order.
[154:25.00]I'll take a steak, please.
[154:28.12]Um... What do you want?
[154:46.70]What happened?
[154:53.91]Prepare the steaks on the grill.
[154:55.05]Once they're done, put them on the plate and ring the bell.
[154:58.25]That's what I did.
[154:58.93]A steak, please.
[155:02.97]Yes.
[155:03.37]Okay.
[155:03.79]Here's a steak.
[155:10.84]Why did the guy leave?
[155:13.06]What the fuck?
[155:14.78]What?
[155:19.32]Don't order food and fucking leave, dude.
[155:36.06]The fucking bank!
[155:37.36]The bank, the bank, the bank, the bank, the bank.
[155:39.04]Oh, the time people are...
[156:06.69]Why is there no juice?
[156:07.93]Oh, because I didn't load it.
[156:16.46]I have to go back.
[156:25.12]I gotta go back.
[156:26.44]I gotta go back here and I gotta come back here like a day early.
[156:34.54]I gotta go back a day early.
[156:36.06]I can't be here 15 minutes before it happens.
[156:40.68]I gotta be here, like, a few days early.
[156:43.87]Go and stop it, potentially, at the hideout.
[156:45.87]Why are you forcing yourself to- I'm not forcing myself to play this.
[156:50.81]I actually am having a good time.
[156:53.75]You suck, and this game sucks.
[156:58.75]Well, why don't you go rake some leaves, then?
[157:01.15]What are you doing here?
[157:03.56]Why don't you go rake some leaves?
[157:06.88]If you don't like the game and you don't like me... What is keeping you here?
[157:10.81]Why don't you go fucking rake some leaves?
[157:15.55]What do you want me to do for you?
[157:23.80]It's summer.
[157:24.88]So go rake some rocks!
[157:33.31]Okay.
[157:34.93]I am going to do this mission.
[157:41.81]Oh, dude.
[157:42.59]Your stream sucks.
[157:43.74]This game sucks.
[157:44.52]My computer sucks.
[157:46.08]I have a virus on my computer.
[157:47.82]Something smells in my room.
[157:51.24]Something smells in my room, too.
[157:52.82]Oh, by the way.
[157:53.44]I ordered something from Amazon.
[157:56.38]I didn't get it today.
[157:57.06]I don't know, man.
[157:57.65]What do you want me to say?
[158:02.84]Spray some air freshener in your room.
[158:16.35]Go play Scrabble.
[158:18.19]Alright.
[158:19.23]I'm gonna do... I have an idea.
[158:22.85]This game doesn't suck.
[158:23.59]You just... You just don't have an IQ like I do to understand it.
[158:25.89]Okay.
[158:27.13]March?
[158:29.23]March?
[158:32.21]14th.
[158:34.69]1871.
[158:36.07]At 12 o'clock.
[158:37.21]This gives us plenty of opportunity to make some stakes.
[158:45.38]We can make some money.
[158:46.08]I'm going to buy a gun.
[158:46.70]And I'm going to stop the robbery.
[158:50.09]Let's go for it.
[158:55.15]You ready?
[158:56.49]I am.
[159:15.17]We're here a day early.
[159:16.07]Okay.
[159:27.15]I have a day to get enough money.
[159:28.97]I'm gonna buy a gun.
[159:30.21]And I'm gonna be prepared this time.
[159:34.34]Sometimes you sound like Peter Griffin.
[159:36.30]It's because Peter Griffin and I... Peter Griffin's a fictional character from fictional New England.
[159:41.96]He has a fictional New England accent.
[159:43.50]Sometimes I have a New England accent.
[159:44.86]I grew up there.
[159:46.60]So sorry, me and Peter Griffin are from the same fucking area.
[159:51.12]I'm sorry.
[159:51.96]I'm sorry that I sound like Peter Griffin.
[159:56.87]I'm leaving that there.
[160:00.71]We're doing this without the time.
[160:05.95]Hey, nobody asked for your life story.
[160:19.04]That's so stupid.
[160:24.08]Where are you from in New England?
[160:25.60]It's Rhode Island.
[160:26.72]It's called Quahog.
[160:27.56]It's like a small town.
[160:35.83]Alright, let's make some money.
[160:48.37]You look like a man that could use a stake.
[160:50.55]Can I help you?
[160:58.60]Anybody want any food?
[161:08.09]Nobody's here.
[161:22.24]Do I have, like, all of my clothes on?
[161:24.28]Why is everyone just sitting here looking at me?
[161:25.58]I don't... What's... Nobody hungry?
[161:40.93]Alright, that was fun.
[161:43.47]Alright, what about the blacksmith?
[161:59.76]They might have bugged out.
[162:01.88]Actually, something really important.
[162:03.44]Oh my god, I forgot.
[162:04.63]It's going to take me a fucking whole day to go back to the... I didn't save it.
[162:10.31]I got to go back to the car.
[162:14.30]Oh, I got to go back to the car.
[162:32.21]I'm... I will be... What's going on?
[162:35.07]What?
[162:42.43]I'm here a day early.
[162:48.63]You fucking assholes.
[163:00.21]God, leave me alone!
[163:01.09]I didn't save it!
[163:41.26]oh
[164:24.39]I didn't save the game!
[164:25.69]I have no health.
[164:29.27]People were tougher back then, dude.
[164:31.75]How do I get rid of these guys?
[164:52.90]You're doomed.
[165:05.50]Okay, at least the game is saved.
[165:08.52]I'm gonna eat some food.
[165:09.50]I don't know if they're gonna follow me or not.
[165:12.37]Probably not.
[165:15.01]Okay, I have a save game.
[165:22.67]Back to the town.
[165:27.34]Okay, blacksmith.
[165:29.88]Can I do some work for the blacksmith?
[165:32.12]I gotta be able to eat, right?
[165:33.06]Yeah.
[165:36.83]Okay.
[165:37.15]Need help?
[165:38.17]Good luck.
[165:39.97]Your task is to craft tools on demand.
[165:41.43]You'll get a guide with every new product.
[165:42.99]Okay.
[165:47.43]A woodcutter's axe, please.
[165:49.60]You got it.
[165:50.22]Woodcutter's axe.
[166:26.84]Okay.
[166:28.04]And then you hit it with a hammer.
[166:35.88]Okay.
[166:41.33]And then this goes into the water.
[166:47.71]Okay.
[166:50.59]And then this goes on a stick.
[167:02.86]I got it!
[167:04.77]Where's the customer?
[167:10.21]Nice, alright.
[167:10.87]What do you want?
[167:12.31]Hammer, please.
[167:12.93]You got it.
[167:16.21]Hammer, hilt.
[167:16.73]How do you make a hammer?
[167:20.33]It's literally the same exact thing.
[167:49.93]Good.
[167:50.39]Alright, anybody else?
[167:54.11]Can I use an axe as a weapon?
[167:56.80]Maybe I can.
[167:57.28]Alright, I'll take a woodcutter's axe.
[168:00.70]And I... Alright, let's go.
[168:11.26]I made it with an axe hilt?
[168:13.27]I don't know.
[168:13.69]Whatever.
[168:14.05]It's fine.
[168:22.11]Is it not ready?
[168:22.51]Oh my god.
[168:55.44]Okay.
[168:56.52]Let's go, let's go.
[168:57.08]Come on, I'm gonna make like 50 bucks.
[169:07.09]You made a block of cheese, kind of.
[169:21.95]I'm running out of time.
[169:22.93]I got enough to do one more.
[169:31.68]What do you want?
[169:32.04]Hurry up.
[169:32.50]Axe.
[169:32.78]Done.
[169:33.08]Go.
[169:57.40]Quick!
[169:59.58]What was wrong with it?
[170:05.10]What's going on?
[170:11.43]Whatever.
[170:12.09]I'm making... I'm taking it.
[170:13.11]I'm making an axe myself.
[170:14.01]$65!
[170:14.03]Go get my gun.
[170:40.58]Who sells the gun?
[170:43.52]Oh, the blacksmith sells the gun.
[170:44.78]Alright.
[170:53.91]Buy Bitcoin right now and cash it out in 300 years.
[170:57.43]Okay.
[171:05.50]And I want the cowboy costume.
[171:09.23]That's too much money.
[171:09.95]Alright.
[171:11.05]So now what do I do with this?
[171:14.73]What am I supposed to do with this?
[171:23.77]How do I make it?
[171:30.03]Revolver parts.
[171:43.75]Do I have to build it?
[171:44.89]How do I do that?
[171:45.75]Do I have to put it together?
[171:56.05]How do I put it together?
[172:01.14]Is there instructions?
[172:11.02]Press the build button?
[172:12.18]I don't think there is a build button.
[172:18.38]Is it just junk?
[172:19.18]I don't think it's junk.
[172:27.31]He's pretending.
[172:28.01]Dude, I got a box of junk on the ground.
[172:32.09]How am I supposed to turn this into a gun?
[172:36.40]Is there a gunsmith?
[172:42.98]They might be.
[172:48.48]Not in this town.
[172:51.84]Unless the sheriff can do it.
[172:55.09]Maybe talk to the blacksmith again?
[173:00.87]Press 8 on the number pad.
[173:02.57]B?
[173:02.87]8?
[173:05.91]That does not do it.
[173:11.37]Can you make anything with this?
[173:12.37]No.
[173:19.75]All this guy sells is props.
[173:22.31]Okay.
[173:24.77]Two and then three?
[173:29.54]Somebody has to be able to put this together, alright?
[173:50.36]Maybe I should bring it to a different time period.
[173:59.11]Oh my god, leave me alone.
[174:00.85]E?
[174:01.09]No, E doesn't do it either.
[174:03.53]It's definitely something I have to make.
[174:04.65]I probably need a recipe or something, yeah.
[174:15.38]Put it on the blacksmith's table.
[174:38.90]Use the bossy.
[174:39.92]I don't know what that is.
[174:43.87]I don't think I can do anything with this yet.
[174:45.07]I probably have to unlock it.
[174:50.89]Unless somebody else can make this into a gun.
[175:17.92]Do not travel to 666 AD.
[175:19.38]I don't even know where the car is, man.
[175:23.48]Do the main quest.
[175:27.94]Okay.
[175:32.24]Is crafting hidden?
[175:34.59]Wait, so I can take this with me and make it and then come back?
[175:43.17]Let me go in the car.
[175:48.31]How far back in travel?
[175:49.15]You can go to 0001 AD.
[175:51.15]1 AD.
[175:51.65]Do you remember saying hi to my grandma?
[175:56.87]She's 82 and loves your streams.
[176:02.95]Um, hi grandma.
[176:08.80]Alright, I'm giving this game another 30 minutes.
[176:10.50]Then we're going to move on to something else.
[176:22.52]Hi, Grandma.
[176:37.63]Wait, is it... What day is it?
[176:44.94]Do they attack the bank right now?
[176:47.88]Go to the future where the gun is already built.
[176:50.18]Alright, hold on.
[177:56.68]I don't have any more fuel.
[177:57.92]Okay, I need to reload the...
[178:21.52]Okay.
[178:22.30]Was that way too dank?
[178:23.18]I'm sorry.
[178:25.78]Way too dank.
[178:41.97]Alright.
[178:42.79]You know, my favorite part about this game is this.
[178:45.61]I love the traveling around.
[178:48.35]I want to find a good place to go.
[178:50.66]I'll do 2023.
[178:52.05]My brain is too small for this game, alright?
[178:54.15]I'll be honest with you.
[178:57.09]See, for instance, I just tried to type in 15 for the month.
[178:59.77]There's not a 15th month.
[179:26.35]Let's go Wedged in somewhere How did I go perfectly into a wedge?
[180:06.95]What the hell is that?
[180:07.97]I can't, I don't think I can get in the car.
[180:16.81]Alright, we're good.
[180:28.95]Headlights, let's go.
[180:33.39]So here's the donut shop.
[180:42.05]Are they aliens or something?
[180:45.19]What is in the road?
[180:54.44]Is that mine?
[180:55.00]I'll take it, I guess.
[181:03.92]God!
[181:04.62]Stop!
[181:05.54]Oh my fuck!
[181:10.04]I keep thinking it's a fucking monster.
[181:12.10]What's going on these days?
[181:25.68]Watch out for the crabs.
[181:49.43]There we go.
[181:50.30]Okay.
[181:50.80]I want that.
[181:58.84]It's like flying spaceships.
[182:01.60]Dorma likes this game.
[182:02.64]I really do.
[182:03.46]I like the idea of this game a lot.
[182:09.99]Why is there a giant laser?
[182:21.87]What the hell is that?
[182:26.02]Is that the track?
[182:46.13]What is that?
[182:48.51]I'm investigating.
[182:51.25]Don't read into it.
[182:51.95]He likes it.
[182:52.43]No, yeah.
[182:53.65]I think it's a really, really fun experience.
[182:56.51]I think it's a really, really cool idea.
[182:59.51]And I commend the devs for trying something different.
[183:09.60]My brain just can't handle going into like three places at the same time.
[183:24.55]Stop being so nice, Madge.
[183:27.25]Why?
[183:27.85]It takes a lot of work.
[183:34.33]I'm still here playing it, aren't I?
[183:35.57]I want to know what the laser is.
[183:45.02]I'm going up there.
[183:45.86]Flashlight.
[184:05.00]What the hell?
[184:05.44]Alright, I'm going up to the laser.
[184:24.57]Drive up there?
[184:25.17]I mean, it's... I... You think I'm gonna be able to drive up this hill?
[184:30.62]That's not gonna happen.
[184:40.47]Ooh, there's a waterfall in 2020 AD.
[184:42.03]Oh, this is not a laser.
[184:47.12]This is a track.
[184:49.88]I'm going to find the laser beam, and it's not what I think it is.
[184:57.07]Very futuristic.
[185:10.31]Is this 2023?
[185:10.85]Alright, now I'll do 9999, right?
[185:24.24]I will do the coveted 99999.
[185:29.78]Oh no, we can't.
[185:30.44]It stops at 2030.
[185:30.90]Right, right, right, right, right.
[185:38.15]Alright, well that was fun.
[185:39.11]That was a cool little game.
[185:40.11]We're gonna move on.
[185:41.83]I just wanted to play it.
[185:42.55]I saw it and I wasn't gonna play it.
[185:43.51]Whatever.
[185:44.93]I think it was really cool.
[185:47.18]I think it was fun.
[185:47.86]I think it was interesting.
[185:49.00]There's a whole main quest line if you'd like to try it yourself.
[185:51.56]It's called No Time.
[185:53.06]It's on Steam, currently on early access.
[185:55.60]Seems like there's a lot of content in it so far.
[185:58.98]That has been Checking It Out Thursdays.
[186:02.44]We're gonna check out something else.
[186:07.35]Go back to Wheel of Fortune.
[186:09.96]Whoa, what is this?
[186:47.39]Oh, it's a lighthouse.
[186:48.13]Okay.
[186:49.57]Maybe I should have got the car.
[186:52.83]That does not hurt.
[186:54.19]That doesn't hurt.
[186:58.73]Shit.
[187:02.05]Alright, we're going to move on.
[187:02.75]I'm going to take a break.
[187:03.39]I'm going to pee.
[187:03.77]I'll be right back.
[187:04.91]That was no time.
[187:05.93]There's a lot in that game.
[187:06.99]If you want to check it out for yourself, give it a go.
[187:09.79]I think that was a fun part of the stream.
[187:11.31]We're going to move on to part two, which that's going to be.
[187:13.95]What would you like to know?
[187:14.93]I would too, because I don't know.
[187:21.07]I'm going to go pee.
[187:21.56]I'll be right back.
[187:22.08]We'll figure it out.
[187:23.28]See you guys in two minutes.
