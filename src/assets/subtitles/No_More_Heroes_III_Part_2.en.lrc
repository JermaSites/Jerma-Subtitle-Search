[00:05.42]Dude, I just took a big sip out of my coffee.
[00:09.38]It was a huge mistake.
[00:11.76]Just a massive mistake.
[00:14.39]Because I didn't Ster it enough.
[00:16.11]I stirred it a little bit.
[00:19.31]And the creamer that I put in went to the bottom.
[00:23.11]And I sucked up pretty much like 30% of the cream that I put in.
[00:26.97]So now my cream ratio is ruined.
[00:31.23]I had this perfect.
[00:32.41]I didn't Ster it enough.
[00:35.24]God, that's a real sad emote scenario, I think.
[00:41.74]Spit it back out?
[00:42.56]He's already swallowed it.
[00:43.70]Yeah, there's some new random emotes.
[00:50.80]We're testing out a couple of them.
[00:53.63]This Jerma window, is there now?
[00:56.91]I might just make that official.
[00:59.41]I was thinking about, because there's animated emotes now.
[01:03.35]I was like, hmm.
[01:04.99]I was thinking maybe I could have me jumping out of the window as an animated emote.
[01:09.31]So we're going to give it a trial run here.
[01:10.63]This one is just free.
[01:13.11]See how people like it.
[01:13.81]I don't want to do jermaTV again.
[01:16.49]Because that is never used.
[01:19.20]And it's just still there.
[01:19.96]Upside down, we're going to play No More Heroes 3 again today.
[01:27.96]Continuing the journey through the game.
[01:29.42]I don't think I'm going to beat it today.
[01:33.75]We're gonna go the same amount of time, I think.
[01:35.09]Somewhere between, like, five, four and a half to, like, six hours or something.
[01:40.25]I wanna play.
[01:40.81]I wanna just get into it.
[01:43.13]But I doubt I will see the end.
[01:46.47]So, we will finish this next weekend.
[01:49.53]After today.
[01:50.87]And after WarioWare.
[01:52.27]Because WarioWare comes out on the 10th.
[01:55.89]So, you bet your ass that on the 10th, we're gonna play WarioWare.
[02:00.37]And on the 11th, probably No More Heroes 3, finish it up.
[02:03.21]I mean, I'm just on the Switch.
[02:05.23]So that makes a lot of sense.
[02:09.33]jermaTV is my most used emote.
[02:11.43]Jerma punching.
[02:12.56]Jerma punching maybe should be official too.
[02:17.76]I got a tweet.
[02:18.64]I'll be right back.
[03:11.80]I'm also realizing the title right now for a lot of you probably just like, what the fuck is he doing?
[03:16.62]That's the seal.
[03:17.94]I don't know.
[03:18.32]I couldn't think of what to write.
[03:19.26]I couldn't think of anything to put on the title because it's just playing no more heroes.
[03:24.60]So I couldn't, whatever.
[03:30.65]Sometimes there's titles that make sense.
[03:34.33]I didn't have one.
[03:36.69]What about the sunflowers?
[03:39.85]Yeah, maybe you'll see those tomorrow.
[03:47.10]I'm just kidding.
[03:47.88]Yeah, I've got a full spread of images to show you today.
[03:54.72]Green thumb Andy.
[04:01.36]You'll see those eventually.
[04:04.02]I got to find a way to put those in and just stall somewhere in the stream.
[04:07.34]I don't want to do it right now.
[04:08.38]I want to wait till there's 25,000 people concurrent viewers here today to do that.
[04:16.48]So, I mean, I'm not going to show the sunflowers until I have 25,000 viewers.
[04:22.46]So, I'm sorry.
[04:23.64]That's just the way it is.
[04:29.61]No, we'll do it in a few minutes.
[04:31.63]I'm just kidding.
[04:33.53]I'm not going to hit 25,000 viewers.
[04:34.47]It's 12,000 people with two eyes.
[04:35.31]Holy shit.
[04:45.42]That's a next level take, I think.
[04:49.92]You're gonna max out at 12k.
[04:52.62]If that.
[04:53.18]I don't know.
[04:54.10]I don't think so.
[05:04.11]Yes, you will.
[05:04.69]Well, we'll see.
[05:05.11]Because if I do, then you get to see some of the sunflowers.
[05:12.29]I'm very excited to play this again.
[05:19.79]Do it now.
[05:22.79]No, we gotta wait.
[05:23.37]A lot of people have been waiting to see these sunflowers.
[05:27.13]So, they might not.
[05:28.77]Maybe they just got the notification.
[05:29.99]Maybe they're eating.
[05:30.67]Maybe they're just hanging out.
[05:31.57]I don't know.
[05:33.09]We're gonna wait till like at least 10 to 20 minutes into the stream.
[05:38.25]Last thing we did was I just beat the ninja.
[05:45.22]The last thing that happened.
[05:48.46]And we just kind of stood right here.
[05:52.18]This is Persona.
[05:55.96]This is no more heroes.
[05:58.14]Free.
[05:58.46]Switch mobile notifications take about 20 minutes to send.
[06:03.35]Yeah, so we got time.
[06:12.35]You won't play the spin-off.
[06:15.59]We have new clothes.
[06:19.99]We already had this.
[06:23.77]I actually really like this.
[06:26.35]Got a good message on it too.
[06:32.80]I really- I like the black hoodie and the black pants.
[06:34.56]Yeah, I'm gonna wear this.
[06:41.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[06:42.37]I wanna see what else is there.
[06:43.27]Hold on.
[06:45.21]Let me see what else is there.
[06:49.85]You have a hoodie that just says, fuck.
[06:56.01]I think you need to load in a little more.
[06:58.53]Let's see what I want.
[07:01.41]I got like two or three other shirts though.
[07:13.51]I actually like that one too.
[07:14.56]That shirt's actually merch of a band.
[07:22.30]Really?
[07:27.97]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[07:37.18]Didn't I get something else?
[07:38.04]I thought I got something else.
[07:40.28]I thought I had another shirt.
[07:41.16]No, I wore kill, kill, kill, kill, kill already.
[07:45.00]I like that hoodie.
[07:49.45]I want to put it on.
[07:55.25]That's the one.
[07:57.75]Let's go for it.
[08:02.38]I want most of these shirts IRL.
[08:03.46]I mean... What's the term?
[08:09.20]What's the term for like... Look at how awesome these... The good clothes.
[08:13.44]Shirts, the pants.
[08:14.54]What is it?
[08:18.05]No more Racists 3.
[08:25.19]It's called Drip.
[08:29.53]I feel like in all the Suda games, there's lots of that.
[08:44.92]You didn't wipe?
[08:55.30]No slang, Andy.
[08:56.24]I don't, how, why would I have slang?
[08:57.90]I'm like 20 years older than you.
[09:02.44]You know what my slang was?
[09:04.04]It was fucking radical.
[09:07.80]Totally tubular.
[09:10.57]You would punch me in the mouth if I said that to you, wouldn't you?
[09:14.53]That's totally, totally tubular.
[09:17.57]Like you would punch me in the face immediately.
[09:19.27]And like, I don't want to, why would I want someone to do that to me?
[09:25.73]51 Ronin.
[09:26.27]What's with the 51?
[09:27.36]51 Ronin.
[09:34.96]51 grams.
[09:36.38]Oh, it's Suda51.
[09:37.76]Okay, but like... Whatever.
[09:41.73]Whatever.
[09:42.59]Alright, let's do it.
[09:43.89]We gotta go to Perfect World.
[09:53.97]This sus guy has really changed.
[09:57.22]No, he hasn't.
[09:58.32]You've changed.
[10:01.68]Your perspective on how you feel about me has changed because you've changed.
[10:17.45]Anti-aliasing Andy.
[10:19.34]Well, I didn't make this game, so don't worry.
[10:24.84]I didn't unclog this toilet?
[10:33.91]You've changed.
[10:37.23]He's got drip.
[10:46.07]This sus guy literally did the face like five days ago.
[10:49.63]That's me.
[10:50.32]Just say I did it.
[10:58.88]We're waiting for the sunflowers.
[11:00.06]Yeah, they're coming.
[11:01.22]Don't worry.
[11:02.28]You'll see them soon.
[11:05.80]It's actually, it's gonna be like really cool.
[11:07.78]I did like a... You'll see.
[11:13.84]I had a professional editor edit the photos.
[11:22.25]We're professionally done.
[11:23.11]I don't think I'm fucking around.
[11:26.45]Cleanliness first.
[11:31.29]Itchy butt!
[11:37.51]I'm watching this while taking this shit.
[11:41.17]That's based.
[11:44.49]You see?
[11:45.23]When I say it, you don't like it.
[11:47.13]You think it sounds weird.
[11:48.95]Right?
[11:50.85]If somebody in your Discord call right now says it, you think that they're cool.
[11:53.82]Do you understand how this works?
[11:56.32]I'm way older than you.
[12:04.24]I gotta save it.
[12:10.75]No, that saying is just dumb.
[12:12.21]Is it a scorpion?
[12:17.95]Ooh, I'll get it.
[12:23.74]You just got plus 10 social credit for that one.
[12:28.90]Why do I save so much?
[12:32.06]It just goes back to like the old days.
[12:35.01]Oh, there is one.
[12:35.45]Okay.
[12:36.09]The old days of video games when shit you didn't save, you got screwed over.
[12:45.96]That was terrifying.
[12:47.08]Why?
[12:57.88]Oh, that deserves a MonkaW.
[13:02.11]It's MonkaW or MonkaW.
[13:05.53]W. It's MonkaW or W. What do you guys prefer?
[13:12.19]A MonkaW or MonkaW.
[13:16.45]Oh, oh!
[13:17.01]MonkaW!
[13:18.66]Which one?
[13:24.60]First one?
[13:25.67]I'd probably say the first one, you know?
[13:29.97]Uh, alright.
[13:30.25]Let me go to the highway.
[13:45.90]This map is big.
[13:49.38]There's fast travel?
[13:50.30]Is there?
[13:51.42]Oh, well, I'm right here.
[14:02.49]Yeah, there is.
[14:03.47]Perfect world.
[14:08.81]Oh, there is fast travel.
[14:13.42]Oh, shit.
[14:14.02]Okay.
[14:14.88]I kind of like the... I like driving around because I like to do the random things, though.
[14:17.62]I don't want to get just used to this.
[14:21.49]Hurry, please show the sunflowers.
[14:23.51]I'm going to show the sunflowers in exactly five minutes.
[14:27.71]T-minus five minutes for the showing of the sunflowers.
[14:31.89]I'm going to go over the entire thing.
[14:35.21]I'm going to tell you everything about it.
[14:36.71]The process.
[14:38.75]Internalizing everything and seeing how things play out.
[14:43.66]Alright, here we go.
[14:45.42]Now, do designated matches.
[14:47.28]Cool.
[14:48.18]I just upgraded a bunch of shit, too.
[14:53.85]Sunflower stream.
[14:54.65]Let's go.
[14:55.27]Yep, let's go.
[14:55.99]Oh, this is a blue fight?
[15:02.67]Yep.
[15:03.67]Alright, let's get back into this.
[15:10.00]Furby's having a good weekend.
[15:10.90]How's your weekend going?
[15:11.98]I didn't even ask you.
[15:22.61]Good.
[15:23.11]Quit stalling.
[15:24.79]I'm playing the game.
[15:25.45]I'm not even stalling.
[15:29.33]Your perception of me stalling is what's changed.
[15:32.06]I didn't change anything.
[15:32.84]I didn't do anything.
[15:37.24]Oh, I thought I was a super mode.
[15:44.88]I hate these guys.
[15:45.44]They're the worst in the game.
[15:49.62]Oh, I have these new moves.
[15:51.38]Holy shit, this makes this game so much more ridiculous.
[15:59.13]Like, holy shit.
[16:05.30]Those moves make this game, I don't want to say easier, but I want to say maybe.
[16:17.74]I'm watching a scary video at the same time as this.
[16:20.04]Why?
[16:22.88]Watching a scary video?
[16:24.14]Close that, you need to pay attention here.
[16:26.38]There we go.
[16:34.46]Do I remember all the No More Heroes 2 bosses?
[16:36.60]I mean... If you told me that if I could name all the No More Heroes 2 bosses in the next five minutes without Google, that you'd give me a million dollars, I wouldn't be able to do it, but I remember a couple of them maybe.
[17:01.76]The fake fan.
[17:02.54]For a second, I thought something was wrong with this bench.
[17:09.47]I thought it was pushed up.
[17:11.61]I was like, what's wrong with this thing?
[17:14.43]I thought it was one continuous piece of furniture.
[17:30.12]Dude, zonked?
[17:36.83]Two minutes until Sunflowers.
[17:37.84]Yeah.
[17:39.90]We're getting there.
[17:49.52]Name all 151 Pokémon.
[17:54.29]Charizard.
[17:56.25]Squirtle.
[17:59.31]Man Champ.
[17:59.69]Uh...
[18:06.82]No Toad?
[18:09.46]Well, that's Futurama.
[18:10.54]Alright, I can't... I have to stop.
[18:12.22]I gotta pay attention.
[18:12.98]Hold on.
[18:25.93]These moves are so good.
[18:27.07]Alright, will you get over... I hate this dude.
[18:43.80]What did I miss?
[18:46.83]You know what's really hard to do?
[18:48.63]Holding left trigger and then having to hit hold left bumper to do like the special moves.
[18:53.17]I guess that's by design.
[18:55.05]Because you can't just do your, uh, yeah, I get it.
[18:59.40]Favorite enemy type so far?
[19:02.52]Um, I like the, I like the sword guys, like the ninjas.
[19:15.95]Good dog.
[19:18.27]Gonna get a double kill here.
[19:20.29]Nice.
[19:20.61]Alright.
[19:20.85]That just saved me a shitload of time.
[19:21.87]10 seconds till sunflowers?
[19:28.26]Here they come.
[19:39.91]Okay, so let's talk about the sunflowers.
[19:43.68]I know for some of you, this is a big deal.
[19:45.10]For some of you, you don't care at all.
[19:46.48]It's not going to take very long, maybe like 10 minutes or so.
[19:49.54]Let's get to a pause menu.
[19:57.48]So a few months ago, I decided that I wanted to... Well, hold on.
[20:02.97]I can't talk over the cutscene.
[20:15.98]Is this a Metal Gear joke?
[20:25.39]Or is he?
[20:31.39]It's me.
[20:33.19]I'm here.
[20:34.95]Where are you?
[20:38.03]Oh, can't you see me?
[20:39.93]That means it's not time just yet.
[20:42.47]What?
[20:42.75]What does that mean?
[20:46.13]Exactly what I said.
[20:48.15]You are not yet prepared.
[20:50.85]Stop screwing around.
[20:55.20]You harbor doubts, don't you?
[20:58.16]With regard to me and yourself.
[21:00.88]Myself.
[21:02.46]Okay, that was awful.
[21:03.70]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[21:04.50]That last one was fucking terrible.
[21:06.26]That was like TikTok cringe compilation levels of bad.
[21:10.15]I'm done with this.
[21:11.47]We're moving past this one.
[21:14.74]Your past.
[21:15.30]Is it really yours?
[21:18.06]What about your memories?
[21:21.52]Your body.
[21:22.74]Your mind.
[21:23.50]Enough with the riddles.
[21:27.03]TikTok.
[21:32.33]I'll give you one more.
[21:33.25]I...
[21:44.82]But am I really?
[21:51.78]Once you begin to doubt, there is no end.
[21:55.90]Aunt May?
[22:00.42]That deserves a sip of coffee with me.
[22:02.71]I just stabbed myself in the fucking mouth.
[22:04.31]Ow.
[22:05.21]The straw.
[22:06.33]I'm bleeding.
[22:08.01]Fucking hold on.
[22:10.05]Yeah, I just like stabbed myself right in the mouth with the straw.
[22:15.07]Yeah, like underneath my lip.
[22:17.17]Like where my teeth meet, you know what I mean?
[22:27.59]It's fine.
[22:28.01]It's not that bad.
[22:30.49]I just, I hit the straw and I hit my teeth and the upper part of my kind of gum lip area and they both connected and it pinched.
[22:42.18]I'm never doing a snake impression ever again.
[22:43.78]That's what caused this.
[22:46.04]Okay.
[22:47.45]Here we go.
[22:48.45]Once you begin to doubt, there's no end.
[22:49.67]But once the seed of doubt has been planted... Call an ambulance.
[22:54.45]Oh, no.
[22:55.83]I bit my tongue.
[22:56.59]I didn't need an ambulance.
[22:59.70]That seed takes root and begins to grow and becomes as you are now.
[23:02.88]What are you trying to say about me?
[23:06.80]We'll meet again.
[23:08.42]Soon.
[23:14.71]To be continued.
[23:21.81]Stop stalling.
[23:22.51]I just had to get away from that and I can pause the game.
[23:33.86]Is this the doy doy doy guy?
[23:36.06]You know what?
[23:37.50]You know, I've been in other fucking TV shows.
[23:41.31]I've had multi-million dollar television shows produced.
[23:45.27]I've been in ten different movies.
[23:47.03]I won two Academy Awards.
[23:50.97]But I'm the doy doy doy guy.
[23:53.89]Yes.
[23:54.85]Five years ago, I made a sound on stream.
[23:58.38]You know how many other things I've done?
[23:59.82]Hollywood Andy.
[24:10.98]Alright, let's do sunflowers.
[24:14.90]But you do it a lot.
[24:16.13]Yeah, I do.
[24:19.13]Alright, so the following...
[24:22.10]Get excited.
[24:22.90]Are you ready?
[24:24.34]So a few months ago, the idea crossed the mind to plant some sunflowers.
[24:33.75]I actually learned a lot about gardening and planting.
[24:37.18]It's something I've never really done before.
[24:41.52]You don't just put things in a pot and just water them.
[24:45.92]There's a lot of things that go into the first two or three weeks of growing flowers that I just had no idea.
[24:52.37]Especially sunflowers.
[24:54.53]So the following images you will see on your screen are that process.
[25:03.31]And this is not just one picture.
[25:05.70]This is multiple images over the course of the entire life.
[25:10.35]So the first one you're going to see, which is pretty cool.
[25:12.84]This is the pot.
[25:15.72]And this is like right, maybe like, I don't know, a week after planting.
[25:19.60]You're probably noticing there's a lot of little guys here.
[25:25.97]He's growing his own weed.
[25:29.43]Not, no, not, no.
[25:32.18]Uh, when you grow sunflowers, or any kind of big plant like this, they sort of fight to get to choose who gets to be the one that lives.
[25:40.78]It's pretty sad in a way.
[25:43.69]Because after you germinate them, and you put them in the ground, you have to thin them.
[25:50.23]And you get to watch which ones are the strong ones.
[25:54.81]And they're the ones that kind of get to stick around.
[25:57.53]Which is sad, because you'll end up with scenarios like this.
[26:02.33]Where this one's coming up.
[26:04.93]It's like, oh, he's so strong.
[26:05.99]He's so big.
[26:07.38]Look at him.
[26:07.70]He looks perfect.
[26:09.14]But the one next to him can't be there.
[26:13.26]So even though the one next to him is growing and looking good, he's going to have to go.
[26:19.52]It's sad.
[26:22.79]Because you have to, with sunflowers, I believe it's at least six to eight inches apart to have them have their roots be okay.
[26:31.40]So, yeah, it was a sad process of watching them all kind of do this.
[26:37.46]And as you see, here they come.
[26:41.15]And you see the ones on the right?
[26:42.49]That's the seed.
[26:44.01]That's the sunflower seed still on it.
[26:46.87]It stays on.
[26:49.24]And then eventually it falls off and they spread out.
[26:52.12]And that's how they look like then.
[26:56.47]So after a couple more weeks, this is probably like maybe two and a half weeks, two weeks.
[27:02.13]The ones that get the tallest forced Darwinism.
[27:10.60]It's called thinning.
[27:13.34]It's not for...
[27:16.46]These look like in-game screenshots.
[27:18.12]Well, they've been like... They've been edited to look a little nicer.
[27:22.30]And to accentuate sort of the important stuff.
[27:27.95]He's thinning.
[27:29.31]No.
[27:29.69]You have to understand.
[27:31.81]If you just... They can't survive like this.
[27:36.03]And you don't know which is going to be a strong seed.
[27:38.51]Because you don't know... Because when you put it... Okay, so some of them don't come up at all.
[27:43.41]Right?
[27:44.13]So when you plant...
[27:46.37]10 to 20 of them.
[27:47.97]Five of them might not even come up.
[27:50.51]So if you just plant one or two and they never show up, you don't have a harvest.
[27:57.15]You don't have a plant.
[27:59.27]So you have to do it like this.
[28:00.45]Otherwise, you don't know.
[28:06.44]This is just another image of it.
[28:08.60]And at this point, it was hard to tell.
[28:10.87]At this point here, it's like, alright, so who's going to be the ones that are going to grow big and strong?
[28:15.53]You can see some of them that look like they're a little bit hardier than others.
[28:20.77]And this is after some of them have already been removed at this point.
[28:27.68]If you can, we'll zoom in here.
[28:29.60]Some of these have actually been removed already.
[28:36.09]Down here, there was one or two that were removed because they just weren't really coming up at all.
[28:40.95]They were stuck.
[28:42.29]They were kind of wilty.
[28:45.20]Would we survive in your society?
[28:54.04]This is basic gardening 101.
[28:55.72]I am not like, what are you talking about?
[29:01.29]This is basic gardening 101.
[29:08.14]Aced?
[29:08.44]Yeah, alright.
[29:09.76]So eventually, after they've been thinned a few times, and some of them were stronger.
[29:14.90]Some of them were strong enough, actually.
[29:18.46]So as you see in the right pot, there are four.
[29:22.08]So four were able to kind of stick around.
[29:24.64]And also, notice the two over here.
[29:27.78]These were taken out of the pot on the right.
[29:31.05]Because they looked healthy enough, and I just, I don't know, just felt bad.
[29:34.65]I didn't want to just... If they were strong, then I wanted them to survive, so they got their own pot.
[29:40.49]Actually, like, three or four of these, besides the one on screen, were repotted.
[29:46.94]If I have to give you a real number of the seedlings, maybe like three or four, maybe five total didn't make it.
[29:54.26]The other ones were repotted.
[29:55.64]And were given as gifts.
[29:57.02]So... It was like, hey, here's like a... Here's like a kind of young sunflower.
[30:02.80]Do you want it?
[30:03.68]You can have it.
[30:06.78]It's like watching your child go off to college in a weird way.
[30:09.40]It's like, okay, here you go.
[30:11.26]I've taken care of them for so long, but... Make sure you give them plenty of water and plenty of sunshine.
[30:16.05]Make sure you aim them at the sun.
[30:17.97]And make sure they eat every day.
[30:19.95]It's like watching your kid go to school.
[30:22.79]Or like off to college or something.
[30:26.96]But, eventually, as you see the ones in the pot on the right, they're about six to eight inches apart.
[30:34.25]So they're good.
[30:35.53]Very healthy, growing, strong.
[30:38.39]This is where it gets interesting.
[30:41.17]See what that is?
[30:41.63]I'll zoom in on you.
[30:46.11]A little praying mantis baby decided to sit up here and stay here.
[30:54.76]And there's an interesting story about this praying mantis.
[31:01.04]They never left.
[31:06.58]And you'll see maybe a few images later.
[31:11.31]Maybe you'll see this little friend again.
[31:16.53]And the best part about the praying mantis was this guy controlled a lot.
[31:22.40]We're talking about, like, if there's aphid problems, right?
[31:26.45]It's really, really easy when you have this just guard dog that's here constantly.
[31:33.38]That was kind of an issue, too, was trying to figure out, like, huh, I don't want to use pesticides, so how do you naturally...
[31:39.23]take care of the leaves.
[31:40.43]I don't want aphids.
[31:41.19]I don't want, like, the spider mites.
[31:43.75]So having to come up with a solution of, oh, you can, like, make your own, like, organic insecticide spray.
[31:48.75]It's like light soap and peppermint.
[31:52.20]And it actually works pretty well.
[31:55.46]And yes, this praying mantis will be in the next Dreamer Rumble.
[31:59.00]So that's a guarantee.
[32:07.26]This is where they started to actually form leaves.
[32:11.15]As you see, they look weird too.
[32:13.15]It's an insane process.
[32:16.24]Look at that.
[32:16.60]Doesn't it look like it's just gonna open up and just spit acid in my face?
[32:23.99]And they were very healthy too.
[32:25.37]They were very healthy.
[32:26.21]They were very strong.
[32:26.97]But the problem was, it's really windy in Vegas.
[32:31.45]And these things grow these long stalks.
[32:34.54]So, do you know how many times there was like 15 plus mile per hour winds here?
[32:40.02]And the panic that ensued of trying to make sure they weren't going to get blown over?
[32:49.35]There were storms, there were big winds, it was just like shit, okay?
[32:53.39]Just shimmy it behind like a wall.
[32:57.99]When it got to this point, this is like, I never thought I was ever going to be able to see this.
[33:04.61]I thought I was going to screw something up.
[33:05.89]There were so many opportunities to like break them or damage them or weather problems.
[33:11.50]I was like, holy shit, they're actually going to open.
[33:15.52]and eventually another probably and this is probably about two months at this point maybe two and a half months eventually they opened and this is what he looks like after opening so there you go there's your sunflower picture big beautiful and ready for the bees
[33:50.97]Is it taller than you?
[33:52.41]Yes, it was.
[33:54.55]Especially the one on the back got to be about, I want to say, 8 feet tall?
[33:58.77]7 feet tall?
[34:00.77]I didn't stand next to it for scale because I'm not going to do that.
[34:02.94]I'm not going to give you guys that image.
[34:07.46]Yeah.
[34:07.92]Oh, there's more.
[34:08.36]Don't worry.
[34:13.78]See the one behind?
[34:18.80]So the one behind did not open immediately with the others.
[34:21.86]Took about another two or three weeks.
[34:25.55]He has his father's eyes.
[34:27.93]But see, the green stakes were to prevent the wind.
[34:30.77]He was really trying to stop the wind from just crushing him.
[34:35.25]The one in the back, actually, at one point was a big windstorm.
[34:38.16]And it bowed to a point where I, like, gasped audibly.
[34:42.16]And was like...
[34:44.31]Like, I just watched, like, a animal that I had.
[34:49.91]Or, like, a fucking kid.
[34:51.73]Like, running out of the house.
[34:53.04]Like, straight out of the house.
[34:53.90]Like, into the front yard and stuff.
[34:55.20]And into, like, the driveway.
[34:56.10]Like, no, don't get back here!
[34:59.16]It was horrible.
[35:02.30]But, he was okay.
[35:07.62]Well, because, remember, this is important to know, too.
[35:10.25]Is, you gotta take care of these every day.
[35:13.17]This wasn't just a, oh, I just have, like, a plant back there, fuck it, don't even care.
[35:17.47]They needed constant attention.
[35:20.37]Trimming some of the leaves, you can see some of the, um, like, some of the browning, the yellowing, you really don't want that to happen.
[35:25.39]You gotta try to keep them healthy, they need water, they need to be trimmed, they need to be, like, fertilized, it's an everyday thing that's out there.
[35:33.14]So, if one of them had, if they got destroyed, like, two and a half straight months of doing this, it would have been so sad.
[35:48.39]So this is the other one.
[35:49.21]This is the secondary one.
[35:52.16]It was just barely opening.
[35:53.14]And here's the cool part about it.
[35:54.16]Sunflowers, if you didn't know, they're not always yellow and orange.
[35:58.54]Sometimes, they can be... Drumroll, please.
[36:03.66]Drumroll, please.
[36:04.36]I'm waiting for you.
[36:09.21]Red.
[36:11.07]Purple.
[36:12.55]Brown, even.
[36:13.55]Almost like a dark brown.
[36:18.72]Now this is a rare.
[36:19.60]You know what I mean?
[36:21.28]You got the yellows are commons, oranges are kind of uncommon.
[36:24.56]Red is rare, purple is fucking legendary.
[36:28.30]And there's white too, yeah there is.
[36:32.71]And the packets that I was using was an assortment.
[36:36.13]So I did not know.
[36:37.33]I had no idea what they were going to be.
[36:40.37]So it really was like opening up flower loot boxes.
[36:48.87]And when it's fully open, kind of went more orange.
[36:54.11]It was red initially.
[36:54.97]Take a look.
[36:58.75]The bees loved these things.
[37:01.33]There was constantly bees, honeybees.
[37:05.33]And going out there and looking at three or four honeybees, just collecting, picking up pollen and stuff.
[37:09.90]It was awesome.
[37:15.89]Because you kind of get to, like, watch what happens around us in a way.
[37:20.47]And don't worry, I'm not going to become, like, a little philosopher in humanity.
[37:24.85]No, but listen.
[37:26.79]When you get to just sit there and watch that, a bee just coming over and just collecting pollen, it's like this whole world is around us of just constant moving and shaking and, like, cars and trucks and airplanes and technology.
[37:41.29]If you slow down for a second, this is ridiculous that this is still going on.
[37:47.25]They collect this shit every day.
[37:51.05]It looks like a stock photo.
[37:52.19]Yeah, that's how good it is.
[37:54.23]Thank you.
[37:54.55]I appreciate that.
[37:59.88]Yeah, that's the one that was in the pot on the left.
[38:03.18]So this one is... Let me see if I can get it again.
[38:06.10]No, no, no, no.
[38:08.62]Where is it?
[38:10.02]Nope.
[38:11.06]Nope.
[38:11.72]Okay.
[38:12.24]So the pot all the way to the left is the one that you just saw.
[38:15.37]It's the red one.
[38:19.92]Now, we're almost done.
[38:24.11]Hey, come on.
[38:24.37]This is like three and a half months in the making.
[38:26.13]I can do this.
[38:26.75]I can stall.
[38:30.23]Take a look.
[38:33.25]Look at how big our boy has gotten.
[38:38.06]He's stuck around for the whole four months.
[38:45.16]And then, one day he just wasn't there.
[38:50.34]When we see these things, it makes us a little sad.
[38:56.92]It makes us cry.
[39:01.58]You ate him.
[39:02.26]I didn't eat him.
[39:08.36]They grow up so fast.
[39:11.62]So, uh, when they had to be, uh, when the sunflowers actually had to be, because they were done, they were kind of dead or dying, they had to be taken up.
[39:21.47]Because here's a really sad thing about sunflowers.
[39:23.59]If you didn't know, this is really important info.
[39:26.03]Sunflowers, at least most of them, there are some that are, um, that they come back.
[39:32.75]I believe perennial versus annual.
[39:34.73]Sunflowers die and don't come back.
[39:37.98]So it's not like, oh yeah, I plant my sunflowers.
[39:40.08]They grow ahead this year.
[39:41.62]Cool, they bloomed.
[39:42.80]See you next year.
[39:43.52]Ooh, it's chilly out in December.
[39:45.32]I'll take care of you.
[39:46.12]No, they're dead.
[39:46.62]They don't come back.
[39:48.60]So watching them die and knowing that that was it and you were just going to kind of trim them down and pull them.
[39:55.94]It was like, okay, I mentioned like having your kid go to college.
[40:01.12]You know, think about what it's like to have, that's, it's like, no, you're, not only you're at college,
[40:08.13]You got married and you're never coming back to mom ever again.
[40:12.28]You got married and you have like four kids and you're gone.
[40:14.64]It was sad.
[40:16.02]Are you going to dry them and roast them?
[40:22.48]They actually were harvested.
[40:24.59]So I took the heads off.
[40:26.89]Spread them out.
[40:30.37]It's a really weird process when you do that too.
[40:34.58]Actually harvesting a sunflower is not what you guys think.
[40:37.48]If you've never seen, go look at a video.
[40:39.18]Go watch like a sunflower harvesting video.
[40:44.67]It's weird.
[40:48.07]You decapitated them.
[40:50.79]Yeah, I did.
[40:51.83]What was that?
[40:52.19]What was that?
[40:56.12]Oh, it's... Wait, is that... I don't...
[41:03.67]Oh, look at it!
[41:04.73]It's Otto!
[41:12.26]But yeah, this guy stuck around the whole time.
[41:15.74]And then he went off somewhere else.
[41:19.38]But it was cool to see the baby turn into the adult.
[41:25.92]I believe there's, what, one more?
[41:27.26]Yeah, so here's the final picture I'm going to show you.
[41:32.79]It was a Hydra.
[41:35.18]So the one in the back grew to be this five-headed Hydra.
[41:42.69]And this is about, I want to say, seven to eight feet tall.
[41:49.55]And there were even more heads, too.
[41:55.18]There were two or three more heads that started that kind of stopped halfway.
[41:58.16]Because sometimes this doesn't happen.
[42:06.46]Getting a Hydra, a lot of people will trim the heads to make the big head, the head in the front, in the middle, bigger and stronger.
[42:13.66]I was like, no, fuck it, let's just see what it does.
[42:17.78]It had like seven or eight heads, but only four or five of them opened like this.
[42:28.13]This is a legendary drop, yeah.
[42:30.81]So I will tell you, that's the remainder of these, we'll zoom in a little.
[42:36.01]It was really cool.
[42:36.91]It was actually cool.
[42:37.57]It seems like a kind of a boring... I mean, I guess when I turned 35, I never thought I'd be like, oh, I can't wait to take a look at my sunflowers.
[42:47.36]But it is kind of cool.
[42:55.14]It was a fun experience.
[42:59.43]And I'm going to do it again.
[43:01.25]We'll see what kind of legendary drops I get next time.
[43:03.89]Or maybe not.
[43:06.33]It's not boring.
[43:08.29]Well, yeah, I don't really think it is.
[43:12.55]But it's so sad now, because they were outside.
[43:15.83]So when I look outside to where they were, it was always sort of a morning ritual to just look out there and be like, ah, there are the... Oh, they're gone.
[43:24.16]They're absolutely gone, completely.
[43:28.00]But I got seeds from their heads, and those seeds, I'm going to preserve them, and that's the seeds I'm going to plant next year.
[43:36.83]So the family will live on.
[43:46.03]Yeah, it was cool.
[43:48.07]We'll do one more to give you a little perspective here.
[43:50.51]So here we go.
[43:51.09]Here's the little babies.
[43:54.93]There they are.
[43:55.43]And they grew into this.
[44:03.58]Plants are so weird.
[44:04.52]The fact that a tiny little seed can just do this.
[44:09.84]It's just crazy.
[44:13.31]So if you want to know which one this one is, this one, I believe, is this one here.
[44:21.35]Yeah.
[44:22.21]So this right here turned into this.
[44:27.08]Stage one, final stage right here.
[44:33.04]Absolutely insane.
[44:43.19]It's to scale.
[44:44.01]Yeah.
[44:47.05]Did you name them?
[44:48.95]No, not really.
[44:52.47]There you go.
[44:52.88]There's the sunflowers.
[45:01.75]The sunflower journey is over.
[45:05.25]Wasn't that worth waiting for?
[45:06.21]The stream's not over.
[45:14.00]The stream's not over.
[45:18.12]Alright, see you later.
[45:19.16]See you next week.
[45:20.98]That was an accidental click.
[45:22.32]You don't have to leave.
[45:22.88]Okay, let's go back to it.
[45:33.44]Back to no more heroes.
[45:34.90]End of the stream.
[45:37.28]I got a couple more battles to do, but yeah, it was cool.
[45:39.32]I always wanted to do sunflowers.
[45:45.57]And they get really big and healthy out here.
[45:47.51]We had some community subs here.
[45:52.09]We had five community subs from STXNE, ten from Leon.
[45:57.93]Five community subs from TheFoolLead and five community subs from Halulu.
[46:02.07]Thank you, guys.
[46:03.27]Thanks, Halulu.
[46:06.50]Appreciate those five subs.
[46:14.68]Talking about your flowers for 10 minutes added years onto my lifespan.
[46:18.16]Well, if you got... Yeah, it's... Cool.
[46:21.84]Cool.
[46:23.46]Can you eat more than the seeds?
[46:24.96]I think you can eat the heads.
[46:26.16]Yawn.
[46:27.44]Shut up.
[46:28.24]I'm talking about my sunflowers, okay?
[46:30.05]Sorry, I'm not like killing people with a fucking sword right now.
[46:32.83]Alright, relax.
[46:38.87]Uh, yeah, I think you can eat the heads.
[46:43.22]I don't know if I would eat the actual heads.
[46:47.08]You can grill them.
[46:49.16]I love sunflower seeds, they're delicious.
[46:54.88]And you get a lot of them.
[46:56.24]That was also surprising, too.
[46:57.34]I was wondering how many sunflower seeds I get from one sunflower head.
[47:02.38]It's like 50.
[47:03.44]It's like 100.
[47:08.17]LS Phone, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[47:09.75]Appreciate it.
[47:16.63]Snooze and Copter.
[47:17.41]What's up with all the community subs?
[47:19.26]Live community subs from Snooze and Copter.
[47:20.54]Thanks.
[47:27.07]Eating your children.
[47:34.58]We're actually eating sunflower babies?
[47:36.30]No.
[47:38.02]I don't think that's, that's accurate.

[47:57.33]I'm not going to say it.
[47:57.97]You can figure it out.
[48:03.73]What's going on right now?
[48:04.59]Why are so many people giving subs?
[48:06.47]MadSturry gave 20.
[48:18.94]MelScribbles5?
[48:20.34]Oh my god.

[48:34.52]Oh my goodness gracious.
[48:35.90]I don't... This is... You guys just did this, like, a week and a half ago.
[48:39.72]You don't have to do it again.
[48:41.59]You guys just did this.
[48:44.09]You know how many people subbed during the dollhouse stream?
[48:47.43]We don't have to do this again.
[48:48.27]I mean, I really mean it.
[48:49.93]Trust me.
[48:54.09]I can't even talk.
[48:57.05]Another 10 came in.

[49:02.81]Oh, Jesus.
[49:04.63]Alright, I'm just gonna... You're funding the sunflowers.
[49:10.92]Sunflowers are like a dollar.
[49:13.02]It's like two bucks for a pack of like a thousand of them.
[49:16.98]You're giving me like a 50 million percent premium.
[49:20.63]So, you don't have to do that.
[49:31.48]Oh my god guys I can't even It's a sub storm It's for some cry cry cry, I'm not gonna cry oh
[49:54.31]Thank you, all of you.
[49:55.39]It's unnecessary, though.
[49:57.23]We don't have to do this.
[50:01.58]Too much.
[50:06.10]You're standing in the middle of the street.
[50:10.16]Hundreds of subs are coming in.
[50:15.05]This is a new enemy.
[50:19.15]He's going to cry when he says he's not going to cry.
[50:21.13]I'm not going to cry.
[50:25.51]Thank you, though, guys.
[50:26.35]Appreciate it.

[50:52.28]I'm going to play.
[50:53.84]This is fucking insane.
[50:55.11]You just did this.
[50:57.33]Thousands of subs came in a week and a half ago.
[50:59.29]I don't expect this to ever happen again.
[51:03.89]Thank you, everybody.
[51:04.67]I'm going to continue to play No More Heroes.
[51:08.51]I really appreciate it.
[51:09.53]I hope that you think it's worth the money you're paying.
[51:11.45]I'll try to use your money the best way I can.
[51:16.31]By buying snacks and by purchasing equipment.
[51:21.20]Oh, you know, I'm gonna get equipment for the stream.
[51:23.50]Like, no.
[51:24.54]Alright, what does this guy do?
[51:27.76]What does this guy do?
[51:28.86]He's cracking.
[51:29.44]You guys are cracking me!
[51:30.44]I'm getting cracked.
[51:31.91]These guys are full-on attackers.
[51:33.35]Guard yourself.
[51:34.11]Watch out for an opening.
[51:35.05]Check your remaining power.
[51:37.83]Sunflower equipment.
[51:39.81]I'm gonna buy stream equipment.
[51:41.17]Like, what the fuck?
[51:42.23]What a lie.
[51:43.03]I'm not gonna buy streaming equipment.
[51:46.02]What does that even mean?
[51:59.46]I love this game, by the way.
[52:00.74]I like gardening equipment.
[52:03.10]Throw crazy!
[52:03.62]Throw crazy!
[52:04.04]Throw crazy!
[52:04.44]Throw crazy!
[52:04.92]Throw crazy!
[52:10.61]Throw crazy!
[52:11.07]I can't grab the boss?
[52:29.13]Why does he keep saying double kill?
[52:30.47]I'm not killing anything.
[52:33.69]Alright, let's go kick this guy's ass.
[52:39.44]I have to do a perfect dodge to hurt him?
[52:58.70]Oh my god, what the fuck's going on?
[52:59.62]Do I have to guard?
[53:02.41]I think I have to first dodge him.
[53:07.77]Alright, dodge.
[53:09.35]What the fuck?
[53:11.87]What do I have to do?
[53:26.23]I guess he just did perfect dodging.
[53:33.29]Jesus.
[53:35.01]No, I can hit him now.
[53:36.23]That was weird.
[53:36.65]Why couldn't I do it before?
[53:37.47]I was just swinging at nothing.
[53:40.16]What are you going to do?
[53:40.66]Harvest Moonstream?
[53:42.06]Tomorrow.
[53:43.60]Just kidding.
[53:50.06]Whoa.
[53:50.54]He's got weirdly timed moves.
[53:55.72]Jesus, this guy's fucking hard.
[53:57.22]He has like 15 different moves.
[54:01.45]Alright, this is my least favorite guy so far.
[54:10.67]I don't think I can dodge that.
[54:31.19]alright there we go that's how you just double it up he's boring he's not boring so you can't beat him I had like an s going that whole time too now it's gonna be a c you've said this is my least favorite guy so far to everybody
[54:58.60]No, I haven't.
[54:59.16]I've sent it to two different enemies.
[55:00.26]What are you talking about?
[55:02.34]This title is so annoying.
[55:08.98]I'm probably so annoying people that scroll by.
[55:10.88]Okay, one more of those.
[55:23.21]There's one right next to me.
[55:28.97]Why are you so self-conscious?
[55:33.40]I mean, think about it, okay, just think about, pull yourself out.
[55:36.72]Think about it with a different perspective.
[55:38.32]If you were scrolling down Twitch right now, and you saw this stream and the title was, Hello there, haha, like how it's funny, like all capitals.
[55:47.52]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out of here.
[55:51.40]You'd be like, I'm not clicking on that stream, that guy's like a dork.
[56:02.42]Where's this fight?
[56:22.18]Don't talk about my favorite streamer like that.
[56:28.60]This is great, so if I really like this game a lot, it's very, I'm having a good time.
[56:33.82]Alright, count how many times I say this is my least favorite enemy, but also count how many times I said I like this game a lot.
[56:42.79]There's so many of these guys, holy shit.
[56:51.24]I gotta fight them inside of this thing.
[57:00.56]Mustang mode.
[57:01.30]Oh my god, give me an S+.
[57:03.82]Come on, S+.
[57:07.52]S+, I can get it by doing this.
[57:08.66]This is how you get the S+.
[57:28.12]Only one guy left.
[57:28.90]Come on.
[57:29.36]It's been like not even two minutes.
[57:30.70]Come on.
[57:43.79]That has to be us.
[57:47.96]I didn't get the 100 combo.
[57:48.94]I know.
[57:49.20]It sucks.
[57:51.80]I'm good though.
[57:52.28]We're fine.
[57:56.37]One minute and ten seconds.
[57:57.37]There we go.
[58:01.43]Probably isn't an S+.
[58:09.04]I took too much damage?
[58:09.86]Yeah, probably.
[58:13.14]Fuck.
[58:17.40]There is actually an SS.
[58:18.81]Oh.
[58:24.98]How much money do I need for the tournament?
[58:31.60]30,000 coins.
[58:31.98]What do I have?
[58:33.72]How many coins do I have?
[58:43.59]I sound sad?
[58:44.39]We just did the sunflower thing and I'm like sad about it.
[58:48.33]Okay?
[58:49.47]I was putting it off for so long.
[58:56.41]These cars are driving backwards, by the way.
[58:57.75]Unless there was a star system in the game.
[59:19.40]I feel like, is there another job I can do?
[59:21.16]I don't know if this is going to be enough money.

[63:23.39]Tried to dodge, but I pressed every button on the Switch's Joy-Con controller because it's a piece of shit.
[63:28.68]Okay, hold on.
[63:29.22]Slow down.
[63:30.00]Don't get angry at this.
[63:31.00]I love this game.

[67:24.55]Never.
[67:26.15]Ever.
[67:27.87]I promise you'll never see that on this channel.
[67:32.09]Ever.
[67:35.79]I got crystals.
[67:36.39]Nice.
[67:43.41]Do I even have enough money?
[67:44.27]I don't even have enough money.
[67:47.03]It's 30,000.
[67:52.62]Good, you would suck at it.
[67:53.52]You don't have to worry about watching me play it.
[68:02.33]I've definitely done... Ooh, I like that.

[68:26.01]Alright, we're going to make some money.
[68:30.83]Let's travel here.
[68:34.75]I know, fast traveling.
[68:35.93]I know.
[68:36.19]Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[68:42.88]I feel like I've already done everything over here and why would I drive by anyway?
[68:55.44]Remember, you only have four months left for two Catboy streams.
[69:01.50]Um... What do you mean, two?
[69:09.45]Catboy's already made their appearance.
[69:11.31]What are you talking about?
[69:18.78]Alright, here's the Scorpions.
[69:21.33]I got shredded snake skin and a chicken feather.
[69:26.09]Oh, now I got enough money.
[69:29.12]Nice.
[69:31.86]It was supposed to be two in a row.
[69:33.08]Do you guys remember?
[69:36.04]Some of you guys that have been here for more than four or five years plus.
[69:39.85]Some of you guys will remember that.
[69:41.99]Didn't I ask a long time ago to have somebody compile every lie I've ever said?
[69:48.32]And it was a funny little joke, but somebody in the chat made a really good point.
[69:51.24]They were like, dude, that video would take forever to make.
[69:53.06]It'd be like four or five hours long of edited clips.
[69:58.84]I'm like, holy shit, is it really that much?
[70:00.48]They're like, yeah, dude, you say weird fucking lies every other stream.
[70:07.89]I'm like, no, but not that much.
[70:12.05]Glitter box.
[70:12.65]Yeah, I will.
[70:17.21]Did I do this one?
[70:19.84]Level 2 volunteer mission.
[70:21.02]Let's go.
[70:21.22]Alright, accelerate.
[70:36.18]Boost.
[70:37.08]It goes two streams in a row.
[70:43.96]Oh, right.
[70:44.28]I can't hit the other cars.
[70:44.98]I forgot.
[70:49.14]Well, it's hard to do that when they're directly in the way and I take up onto the whole road.
[70:54.75]The only thing I've hit this whole time has been a pedestrian car.
[70:58.87]It's the only thing I've hit the whole time.
[71:15.47]Get it!
[71:20.31]God.
[71:24.29]It's because I have to hit him with the edges of the car, right?
[71:26.93]I don't have a minute to do this.
[71:29.63]I'm not going to do it.
[71:44.52]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[71:53.29]Just forget about it.
[71:54.17]I have to just win.
[71:57.07]Can you get an F?
[71:58.91]I guess F is actually not completing it.
[72:00.45]Is there actually a D or a C the lowest you can get?
[72:14.52]I'm just looking at chat.
[72:32.32]Name the Mantis Cromwell.
[72:34.54]It's not a bad name.
[72:41.58]Fuck.
[72:52.18]Get over here!
[72:58.67]I'm gonna be really honest with you.
[73:00.85]This minigame is as good as the game that's in the ad for the iPad game.
[73:09.18]That's how good this is.
[73:11.38]Like, the ad you get for the game.
[73:14.96]For the iPad game that they're advertising you.
[73:19.38]The ad game.
[73:20.16]That's same quality.
[73:33.23]A lot of you don't get it?
[73:34.25]Alright.
[73:34.78]So, you know when you get an ad for an iPad game?
[73:37.98]And they say, DRIVE ON THE ROAD!
[73:40.34]Then you just put your finger and you have to actually do it to... It's not the actual game.
[73:44.46]It's an ad game for the actual game.
[73:47.72]I don't get ads.
[73:48.88]You're just a hater.
[73:49.96]Mobile gamer.
[73:53.04]Well... Never mind. ...
[74:06.67]Is there another one already?
[74:09.19]Level 3?
[74:09.57]Oh god, I hate this!
[74:10.73]I don't wanna do level 3.
[74:22.67]I'm just gonna get out of the way.
[74:24.43]It's all about speed, that's all I care about right now.
[74:36.58]I'm collecting these, like, punchies.
[74:37.50]That's all I care about.
[74:38.18]Good start.
[74:50.43]Good start.
[74:51.67]This might be A. Alright, wait for the cooldown.
[75:12.83]No pedestrians hit.
[75:18.97]I'm just waiting to accidentally touch the screen so the app store opens.
[75:51.27]Alright one more come on still in this territory.
[76:06.90]Oh, please Don't hit yellow So close
[76:19.93]So close, so close, so close, so close, so... Got it.
[76:23.97]Is this giving me motion sickness?
[76:28.42]Me too.
[76:29.74]I'm just trying to get him out of the way.
[76:35.29]Alright, I'll take a gold.
[76:56.77]Holy shit.
[76:58.75]Death Drive MK1.
[76:59.79]Do I get a car?
[77:06.51]Nice.

[77:14.58]This is rank... Coming up rank 6?
[77:16.66]Rank 7?
[77:18.22]I don't know.
[77:18.52]I'm just playing.
[77:21.06]Go to the video store first.
[77:22.24]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[77:26.75]What the hell's a video store?

[77:37.33]Ooh!
[77:39.17]Should I do trash collection?
[77:43.25]Where is it?
[77:43.81]Is it Beefhead?
[77:51.73]What is that?
[77:52.07]What's the video store called?
[77:52.95]The video store is near Parliament.
[77:59.17]I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
[78:00.47]You didn't stand up slowly.
[78:04.25]And arch your back and put your chin in the air.
[78:06.31]So I may as well not have... I don't understand what you just said.
[78:19.52]Yeah, this is it.
[78:30.87]This guy's high as fuck.
[78:37.23]No, he's not.
[78:39.17]Deathman is just too damn cool.
[78:40.64]Here's your cut.
[78:43.26]Final doll.
[78:47.58]I had more than one, didn't I?
[78:51.42]Hey, what's up?
[78:52.69]Check card.
[78:53.57]Oh, sell junk?
[78:57.55]That's 10 grand.
[79:01.58]Wait, but isn't this... I don't know.
[79:03.85]These are materials.
[79:07.71]I don't want to sell these.
[79:10.81]This is not junk.
[79:14.41]No, no, no, no.
[79:15.17]I don't want that.
[79:15.67]Cool.
[79:15.77]Do not sell.
[79:16.05]Hold them.
[79:20.98]Yeah, I'm not selling.
[79:24.44]Hold them.
[79:28.94]I have the things I put in my watch.
[79:30.56]I'll just take the money.
[79:37.90]You ever been to Boston before?
[79:40.10]Never?
[79:40.30]I heard it's like a pretty cool place.
[79:41.93]I live in Vegas, so... I don't know.
[79:46.35]I heard it's pretty cool, though.
[79:47.07]I heard it's a nice place.
[79:49.15]Have fun when you go.
[79:52.13]On the other side, isn't it?
[79:52.93]Yeah.
[79:54.21]Of course it is.
[79:59.58]You should go to Boston.
[80:00.22]They have pizza.
[80:03.26]Yeah, they do, I heard.
[80:04.54]I heard it's really good.
[80:06.33]I heard that if you don't have it for a while, you really start to miss it.
[80:11.35]And you wish you could have it.
[80:15.37]But you can't.
[80:17.27]From what I understand, what I've been told, nothing comes close where you currently are.
[80:22.85]Nothing comes close.
[80:26.69]Prince, you hate me, don't you?
[80:29.85]I don't hate you.
[80:30.71]I just don't like you is all.
[80:33.37]That counts as being in the hate category, but what would you know, huh?
[80:38.32]You making fun of me?
[80:39.92]I'm just being honest.
[80:42.15]Listen, value those who tell you the truth.
[80:45.93]Nobody speaks their mind in front of the prince.
[80:48.97]What?
[80:50.37]The people always say nice, happy things to you.
[80:54.76]But they're either talking shit behind your back, or they're knocking on you to the king.
[80:59.94]Definitely.
[81:01.24]One hundred percent.
[81:03.64]Is this true?
[81:05.16]If you don't believe me, set up some cameras or something.
[81:09.30]This shit is not okay.
[81:12.30]I'm gonna execute them all.
[81:14.34]Hey, now, calm down, Prince.
[81:17.04]That's textbook spoiled rich kid talk.
[81:20.26]Let it go.
[81:21.62]Bernie Sanders?
[81:21.98]Forgive your enemies and make them your friends.
[81:24.94]No, it's not.
[81:25.68]That's how a real leader does it.
[81:29.45]Vanishing point.
[81:31.07]Will you keep being honest with me?
[81:33.37]Prince, I couldn't bullshit you even if I wanted.
[81:37.47]No, that's like vendor in Gadgetzan.
[81:40.16]Come on.
[81:57.15]I love that voice though that like hey come on what do you got this game for you the hell is it go ahead open it what you don't mind what if it's a love letter or something love letter my ass kimmy love wait for reals it's for kimmy's concert it's an invitation to the vip seats oh
[82:21.47]This is huge.
[82:22.59]Do you know her or something?
[82:24.55]Who the hell is that?
[82:25.99]Recently they say she's even bigger than Taylor.
[82:28.53]Yeah, she's famous.
[82:29.35]I got that.
[82:30.41]This already sounds hella sketchy.
[82:32.27]Why are they doing this?
[82:34.51]Just play along and accept the invitation.
[82:37.01]Otherwise you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
[82:39.39]I know I will at least.
[82:41.07]This concert is some serious shit.
[82:43.32]If it's serious shit, more reason to say screw it.
[82:50.79]It's a weird thing to have.
[82:54.35]An alien criminal who steals memories.
[82:57.59]This should turn out to be a real battle of the minds.
[83:01.55]Hey, call before you show up.
[83:03.89]What?
[83:04.69]Is there something you do not want me to see?
[83:07.17]Is this also part of the review?
[83:09.23]I'm subscribed to your channel, you know.
[83:11.37]The recipe stuff you do is awesome.
[83:13.45]I check it out for tips all the time.
[83:15.49]It's funny this was just pulled transcript right from whatever review they're parodying.
[83:20.95]It really should be me doing it, but... Diversity!
[83:24.77]Diversity!
[83:25.59]I mean, I don't know what that means, but diversity is something people say at times like this, right?
[83:34.31]Are you acting as an agent for the ranking battles?
[83:37.82]Prince Fu has formed a business alliance with the UAA.
[83:41.88]So as the head organizer, I can move around freely.
[83:45.48]They're safe to keep your enemies close, right?
[83:48.20]They're talking about real movies.
[83:49.72]I thought the reviews were real, too.
[83:52.00]I know, right?
[83:53.85]Travis is kind of simple-minded, so he doesn't realize what he's got here.
[83:58.97]I appreciate everything.
[84:00.67]For reals, I mean it.
[84:02.33]Okay, whatever.
[84:04.32]Accept this invitation and go to the concert.
[84:07.74]Vanishing Point will be there.
[84:09.86]Anyway, I'm kind of in a hurry.
[84:23.46]Not real reviews.
[84:24.24]I don't know why someone said that.
[84:25.51]Did I get one guide?
[84:26.57]Because yesterday people said there was real reviews.
[84:31.27]It was more than one guy.
[84:32.43]It was a lot of guys that said that.
[84:34.11]Alright, 20.
[84:39.62]I have to get 20.
[84:41.18]I refuse to leave if I don't get at least 20.
[84:43.29]You were tricked.
[85:02.95]That counts?
[85:04.45]Double the dead if you don't get to 20.
[85:05.73]No, we're not doing that.
[85:08.51]Once you get to 12, 15, 16, it becomes impossible.
[85:13.85]I gotta treat this like I treat Stacker in the arcade.
[85:16.47]It's just on the first go through, right?
[85:18.01]Immediately.
[85:18.67]Don't give it a chance to fuck with you.
[85:20.43]Just the first pass.
[85:21.45]Hey.
[85:23.65]That's the Stacker strategy to how you get the major prize every time.
[85:28.85]Don't even let it do it.
[85:30.33]Don't let it go over, because then it gets in your head.
[85:32.05]Just the first movement it does.
[85:34.45]Okay, well, it baited me a little bit, and they got my stacker strategy.
[85:36.99]They heard about it.
[85:41.50]Stacker is rigged.
[85:42.26]I know it is.
[85:50.38]But if it goes past it on the first pass, you gotta do it.
[85:57.56]Alright, now that strategy's out of the way.
[86:03.62]Shit.
[86:04.06]This is so hard.
[86:05.70]I have to get 20 or I'm not getting up from this.
[86:08.03]I promise, I swear to God.
[86:10.23]Steady your hand.
[86:10.85]I'm not doing that.
[86:11.43]Alright, it's alright.
[86:14.49]I'll give it 20.
[86:15.13]This is boring.
[86:16.39]Alright, like, chattered 500, whatever. 20.
[86:31.57]Don't yikes me right now, okay?
[86:33.99]I'm restarting that because somebody yikes me.
[86:37.61]Yeah!
[86:52.49]20.
[86:53.47]I've hit 17.
[86:54.35]I can hit 20.
[86:55.65]Don't be an idiot.
[86:56.25]Just be smart about it.
[86:56.99]Don't blame chat.
[86:58.87]I am.
[87:09.01]The debt will be cleared if you watch Cromwell on stream.
[87:11.55]Well, that would be illegal, so no.
[87:14.59]I would rather have fake debt to a chatroom of friends and family members.
[87:20.23]Well, none of you are friends.
[87:22.11]No, just wait.
[87:22.65]Hold on.
[87:22.87]None of you are family.
[87:26.17]I just fucked myself over here.
[87:27.70]I just fucked everything up here.
[87:30.44]I just created a huge problem right here.
[87:32.72]Do you understand how much of a problem I just caused myself right now?
[87:38.89]What's up?
[87:39.42]Just a single little offhanded comment just created a huge amount of problems.
[87:43.32]Okay, so listen.
[87:44.74]What was I saying?
[87:46.84]Okay.
[87:47.86]Having a debt on my channel as a joke is not as good as having debt with lawyers and actually getting into real debt because I get sued from like fucking Paramount Pictures for watching a licensed TV movie on my stream.
[88:01.85]That's illegal.
[88:03.20]Come on.
[88:04.22]Bring it.
[88:10.97]Too late.
[88:11.71]We're family now.
[88:14.71]The debt isn't a joke.
[88:17.91]Okay, but you understand?
[88:19.03]Like, you and I, as acquaintances, as online entertainment acquaintances, I'm not- Look, listen to me.
[88:27.08]I'm gonna give it to you real.
[88:29.88]I can't call everybody my friend.
[88:31.92]I don't know half of you guys.
[88:33.78]No, that implies I know half of you guys.
[88:35.30]I don't fucking know any of you guys.
[88:37.03]I don't know anybody here.
[88:38.21]I know, like, eight of you.
[88:41.89]Paralegal?
[88:42.61]Parasocial?
[88:43.47]No.
[88:43.79]Listen.
[88:45.89]I just fucked it up.
[88:46.59]Until I get 20.
[88:47.17]I'm not leaving until I get 20.
[88:47.95]He hates us.
[88:48.35]No.
[88:48.41]Paralegal.
[88:48.73]Paralegal.
[88:48.99]Parasocial.
[88:49.29]How does Mike know?
[89:15.37]Alright, we're good.
[89:20.47]I thought we were family.
[89:24.01]This is my favorite one of these comments.
[89:26.67]I thought we had something.
[89:27.69]I know not... Hold on, I gotta read it.
[89:30.03]I make sure I get it right, because it's funny.
[89:34.34]I thought we had something.
[89:35.88]I can understand the other people, but me?
[89:38.72]I like that.
[89:41.24]That's funny.
[89:42.86]Family is everything.
[89:53.15]Where's my Christmas present, family member?
[90:05.02]You don't turn your back on family.
[90:09.61]Paranormal relationship.
[90:18.01]I invited you to my birthday party.
[90:20.85]You see how hard this gets after 10?
[90:22.45]20 is insane.
[90:32.59]Alright.
[90:33.01]We're on a good pace here.
[90:34.31]I got three lives.
[90:43.60]Nice.
[90:45.08]Use the stacker technique.
[90:46.06]It works every time.
[90:48.82]I had it, but I second-guessed myself in the last quarter of a second.
[90:51.90]Alright, come on.
[91:00.14]20, let's go.
[91:00.50]Shit, is that in there?
[91:04.47]Ah!
[91:04.57]Come on!
[91:20.40]That's fucking with me.
[91:24.63]Shit!
[91:25.81]One more try.
[91:26.97]Alright, I'm 35.
[91:29.25]What am I acting like that for?
[91:31.40]Shit!
[91:31.78]Stomping my feet.
[91:32.54]What am I, 12?
[91:33.26]Let's go, come on.
[91:36.08]Last try is pretty good.
[91:53.31]Isn't your birthday Hobbit Day?
[91:54.67]I want that person banned permanently.
[91:57.21]Permanently.
[91:59.36]And then I want them unbanned.
[92:00.40]And then I want them timed out for 10 seconds.
[92:03.46]That's an old joke.
[92:18.64]-2.
[92:21.08]But it's a good one.
[92:30.46]Alright, back up to 10.
[92:31.06]This is my last try.
[92:33.18]If I don't get to 20, then whatever.
[92:34.24]I'll get a game to play.
[92:41.71]That... Come on.
[92:42.59]That's such bullshit.
[92:43.49]That's in.
[92:44.51]I'm gonna be quiet.
[93:07.04]That's in.
[93:12.60]Shit!
[93:13.04]I thought it was gonna move really fast.
[93:15.98]Holy fuck, this is impossible.
[93:18.78]Actually impossible, you just get lucky.
[93:25.27]Alright, this is my last attempt, I swear.
[93:39.40]What's up?
[93:51.09]I'm not talking at all until I get it.
[93:52.99]I just have to lean in, just stare, and not say any words and just focus.
[94:02.32]Yeah, come on, bring it.
[94:07.22]Added a game designed for cats.
[94:14.76]Alright, here we go.
[94:30.66]What's up?
[94:31.26]Where are you aiming?
[94:34.08]Come on, what's the matter?
[95:00.40]Then it's in right on the edge.
[95:03.23]That's a right of the corner paint to the corners Come on what's the matter?
[95:20.88]What's up, huh?
[95:25.28]Come on, what's the matter?
[95:33.09]the fuck in there.
[95:33.77]Two more.
[95:37.69]Ah!
[95:39.25]I thought it was gonna go right across immediately.
[95:41.33]Alright, come on.
[95:42.69]18's enough.
[95:43.75]It rounds up to 20.
[95:44.95]You stupid game!
[95:51.75]You dumb game!
[95:52.69]One more.
[95:53.19]No.
[95:53.69]Fuck!
[95:54.15]What's up, huh?
[96:03.17]I'm just getting so goddamn mad, I'm just like gonna start punching my fucking desk!
[96:11.06]PUNCH THE DESK!
[96:12.06]PUNCH THE DESK!
[96:15.48]I'M SO SICK OF THIS!
[96:16.84]I'M SO SICK OF THIS!
[96:30.83]Ha!
[96:50.99]Remember, I just joined the stream.
[96:55.47]Hey, what's going on?
[96:56.05]How are you?
[96:57.17]Good to see you.
[96:58.53]That was Tommy Wiseau.
[97:04.60]Paranormal streamer pretends for likes.
[97:20.09]This is a pretty good run so far.
[97:21.49]I haven't missed.
[97:25.27]Bingo.
[97:25.61]We're at 14.
[97:26.03]Three lives.
[97:27.59]Let's go.
[97:27.95]This is the one.
[97:30.55]That's it.
[97:32.09]Aye.
[97:32.45]Alright.
[97:34.65]I'm fine.
[97:59.05]That's it.
[98:00.41]Done.
[98:04.89]I win.
[98:06.33]Good game.
[98:07.97]20.
[98:08.17]That's impossible.
[98:09.63]That's literally not completable.
[98:11.98]I'm done.
[98:30.25]That's not possible to get that.
[98:32.03]Look at how small that is.
[98:33.99]I got to 20.
[98:36.35]That's what I wanted.
[98:36.89]Is that not worth anything?
[98:43.76]Really?
[98:44.06]Get a 50 high score to clear the debt.
[98:56.86]That's not possible, man.
[98:59.40]Sorry.
[99:03.42]25 is a t-shirt.
[99:06.08]You just decided that 20 was an arbitrary number.
[99:08.46]But doesn't 20 sound like a number?
[99:10.22]First of all, 10 sounds like a number to get something.
[99:13.84]20 sounds like a number to get something cool.
[99:16.00]And then something like crazy, like 50 is just, oh, you get the achievement and you get like a t-shirt or something, right?
[99:30.13]The prize is at 51.
[99:30.89]Aye, aye, aye.
[99:32.79]Alright, what am I upgrading here?
[99:34.93]I got a lot of money.
[99:40.19]What should it be?
[99:41.65]I'm thinking attack power.
[99:47.09]Definitely attack power.
[99:47.99]I got 79.
[99:48.47]Did I get the charge?
[99:51.43]I feel like I wouldn't use this this much though.
[99:53.22]I would use the double dodge.
[100:00.66]More battery, yeah.
[100:05.52]Do I have enough?
[100:10.22]Yeah, I can do another attack.
[100:11.92]Yeah, I want another attack.
[100:21.65]2,000 left.
[100:21.93]Is that enough for 36?
[100:22.69]Yeah, I can do health.
[100:23.77]Nice.
[100:29.31]Cool.
[100:29.69]Alright.
[100:31.55]Good.
[100:34.93]I don't think I got any new chips that I want to put in.
[100:41.48]We'll see.
[100:42.48]Is this new?
[100:52.42]Oh, this one's new.
[100:53.28]Hmm.
[100:59.18]Death force attack power 10% higher.
[101:01.08]Death slow duration 10% up.
[101:07.46]I like that.
[101:07.90]That's my favorite one, I think.
[101:09.78]Out of the kick.
[101:12.12]When health is at 20% or lower, weapon attack is... This is worded weirdly from my brain.
[101:18.60]When health is at 20% or below, weapon attack power 15% up.
[101:21.55]Okay.
[101:21.71]Now...
[101:31.19]I already have one of these.
[101:31.89]During slowdown after a perfect dodge.
[101:37.35]That's good, but not enough.
[101:38.61]I would want it to be like 30%.
[101:39.55]I'd get three of those.
[101:41.25]Oh, I think I'm good for the chips right now.
[101:54.10]It's like tanky.
[101:54.76]Okay.
[101:57.16]I think that's fine.
[101:57.86]I think the ones I have are good.
[102:05.70]I do want health.
[102:07.34]Definitely always have this maxed out.
[102:11.84]It's just Estus's essentially at this point.
[102:14.88]I have not even used this.
[102:16.04]I can look at my menu, my quick menu, right?
[102:22.75]Because I haven't even used any of those.
[102:28.65]Special move.
[102:29.47]Okay.
[102:29.81]This is my sushi.
[102:32.31]How can I tell?
[102:32.81]Can I see like the menu?
[102:41.01]No, is there a way I can tell?
[102:42.31]What's mapped to what?
[102:46.31]I don't know what's mapped to what.
[102:47.17]You can only see it in battle.
[102:49.99]Oh well, okay.
[102:51.05]Well, I got what I wanted.
[102:52.61]I might actually eat one of the actual eat-in ones.
[102:54.73]You know what I mean?
[102:58.35]For this fight.
[103:03.79]How's everybody doing?
[103:07.10]Master, master.
[103:08.70]It's me, I'm right here.
[103:11.07]Shinobu, wake up.
[103:11.91]I'll teach you a super special suplex.
[103:14.69]Hurry up and wake up.
[103:16.29]Let's get training.
[103:17.57]My favorite suplex is... It's gotta be the one that Maeda used to take down Ordoff with a reverse arm assault.
[103:24.08]When he made his triumphant return from Europe as Quick-Kick Lee.
[103:28.92]Fleeting beauty of that bridge in Parabola.
[103:31.74]Shinobu, remember how that moment felt.
[103:48.05]Parabola relationship.
[103:49.37]Parasocial.
[103:50.11]Whatever.
[103:52.11]Oh, it's Jean.
[103:55.51]Jean?
[104:02.60]Not interested.
[104:04.32]Not interested.
[104:04.86]What?
[104:05.38]Try it again.
[104:05.70]Jean?
[104:08.58]Jean?
[104:16.09]No, doesn't care.
[104:19.68]Okay.
[104:28.90]Alright, time for rank battle.
[104:32.89]Versus the memory guy.
[104:38.93]Stop having a parasocial relationship with your cat.
[104:51.50]Alright, I'm gonna get sushi.
[104:59.72]True.
[105:00.14]What do you mean true?
[105:05.69]Okay, it's sushi time.
[105:07.75]Should I do that first?
[105:13.95]Will that last all through to my next battle or something?
[105:16.12]Or should I buy it right before the boss door?
[105:19.06]I would assume right before the boss door, right?
[105:28.95]Yeah, I was by there.
[105:39.76]Perfect world.
[106:11.26]Is he finally playing the game?
[106:15.26]Yeah, I mean, I've been just kind of grinding money.
[106:21.84]Practice that off stream for at least 20 minutes.
[106:23.78]Nope, not even one second.
[106:27.86]Or maybe a few seconds.
[106:28.84]Maybe like two seconds.
[106:29.68]That did sound very practiced and rehearsed, didn't it?
[106:31.92]But I didn't.
[106:32.42]I can assure you.
[106:42.85]This is weird.
[106:45.95]I'm buying one of the Eden ones.
[106:47.33]They're expensive, but I'm gonna do it.
[106:58.18]This one's really expensive.
[106:59.48]Okay, if you die, you come back to life.
[107:00.87]That's a lot of money, though.
[107:03.15]Greatly increased health and attack power.
[107:05.01]Okay.
[107:09.19]This is just a chef's choice.
[107:10.25]Who knows?
[107:10.59]Maybe he's more easily stunned.
[107:16.91]I'll just go with this one.
[107:22.54]Yeah.
[107:24.04]Enter into battle with a greatly increased health and attack power.
[107:28.31]It's very expensive, but I'm gonna do it.
[107:30.56]I think it's worth it.
[107:34.02]Can you say your stream title out loud so I know what it means?
[107:37.00]Sure.
[107:37.48]It's Hey There.
[107:37.96]Get outta here, get outta here, get outta here, get outta here, get outta here, get outta here, get outta here.
[108:08.24]It's the seal video of the seal talking.
[108:19.73]And that really cleared it up, thanks.
[108:22.13]Anytime.
[108:24.94]Okay, it's time for a fight.
[108:27.50]Action!
[109:02.51]Whoa.
[109:12.32]Oh, shit!
[109:17.62]It happened again?
[109:18.42]Back to back?
[109:36.01]Aren't these all these guys supposed to be Thanos level threats?
[109:40.63]What's he doing up here?
[109:59.99]This is the high school girl from the second game.
[110:02.64]Is it?
[110:17.18]Oh.
[110:19.14]Wait, do I have to go?
[110:20.06]Oh.
[110:31.19]We need a voice crack.
[110:32.63]I need a voice crack right now.
[110:35.19]Please.
[110:36.26]Please suit him.
[110:38.94]This certainty hits the core.
[110:41.92]Start to reform.
[110:43.12]You're not the same as before.
[110:44.78]Excited in new ways for these fresh new days.
[110:47.64]You changed the world, girl, with your gaze.
[110:49.70]For you, never furious, fragrant, and delirious.
[110:53.32]Little girl, lost for days.
[110:55.59]Swore to grow up and get out of this maze.
[111:07.00]This is so- this is so- this is all- this is insane.
[111:11.34]I don't even know.
[111:39.58]Wait, what?
[111:40.52]This is so stupid.
[111:41.20]This is insane.
[112:05.46]I don't even know.
[112:06.32]I can't even process what just happened.
[112:08.34]He actually had a voice crack.
[112:14.27]Oh, God.
[112:18.97]Yeah.
[112:22.83]Where?
[112:26.95]Oh, they explode.
[112:27.87]Okay.
[112:27.99]Okay.
[112:31.10]Stop it, quick!
[112:32.64]He just snapped my neck!
[112:34.00]Oh my god!
[112:45.79]Get off of me!
[112:48.27]Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine, everything's good.
[113:05.40]Dodge.
[113:05.74]I need to do some dodging, man.
[113:07.05]I'm not dodging anything.
[113:09.47]Alright, let's go.
[113:19.75]Nice and easy.
[113:20.31]Get in here.
[113:31.51]Oh, Mustang mode, it's over!
[113:34.45]Oh my god!
[113:35.25]Holy shit!
[113:37.84]I don't even know what's happening, I'm still swinging, she's in a cutscene!
[113:56.15]What?
[113:58.03]Oh my god!
[114:03.76]Oh shit, I'm dying down here!
[114:05.24]Holy shit, do I guard?
[114:12.60]Can I block it?
[114:14.38]No, I can't block it!
[114:15.24]She back?
[114:24.79]Ow!
[114:29.41]This view is insane.
[114:30.92]No, not this shit again.
[114:35.24]Did you hear that?
[114:36.86]Hey!
[114:37.02]Hey, hey, hey, get outta here!
[114:42.64]Got it.
[114:48.38]Game over.
[114:53.77]Got it.
[114:54.35]Is she dead?
[114:54.75]She's over here.
[114:57.39]See you later.
[114:57.77]That was crazy.
[115:01.55]That was fucking crazy.
[115:13.45]Yeah, and it was a diamond cutter.
[115:14.45]Thunder Fire!
[115:34.46]Damn.
[115:34.68]Oh my goodness gracious.
[115:37.12]I'm so overstimulated right now.
[115:56.79]First of all, they pulled the, it's not this boss, it's this other guy.
[115:59.73]At this point, I'm assuming that all the people in Foo's party are just dudes they found at the subway that are in fucking Halloween costumes.
[116:09.52]No, they haven't done anything!
[116:10.62]Alright, that's B. I'll take a B.
[116:28.57]Oh, I got a CD.
[116:38.42]Congratulations.
[116:39.40]That was the most wild one yet.
[116:41.46]As number seven in the galactic rankings.
[116:45.14]And just look at this kid.
[116:46.76]I guess she just could not grow up after all.
[116:50.37]This is the last time I kill a woman.
[116:53.80]Well, how kind of you.
[116:55.12]Don't ever hit a girl.
[116:56.93]My grandma used to tell me that.
[117:00.09]What are you?
[117:00.95]A good Samaritan now?
[117:02.53]How far do you think that kind of posing will get you?
[117:05.09]They're just cheering.
[117:07.67]Aren't they fans?
[117:09.17]I'm only after those fucking alien assholes.
[117:11.85]I never signed up for this.
[117:13.73]The strong survive.
[117:16.00]Zadis has a world of healing works.
[117:18.60]You have not forgotten, have you?
[117:21.21]Did you think you were going to become friends and team up to defeat the big, mean aliens?
[117:27.18]This is not a superhero thing.
[117:29.30]It is not that simple.
[117:31.02]Why don't you ask your katana there just how much blood it has sucked so far?
[117:40.56]It is still too early.
[117:42.50]Stay at the ready, though.
[117:52.85]I mean, if I have to rank the Star Wars movies, this is definitely number one.
[117:58.15]Without a doubt.
[117:58.61]Like, No More Heroes 3 is by far the best one.
[118:12.98]The one thing that I miss, and this is why we played the second game, right?
[118:17.74]I really, really liked the 8-bit...
[118:21.43]Sort of old Nintendo-esque minigames for money.
[118:24.29]Those are really cool and just kind of funny and interesting.
[118:27.00]And they're really easy to play over and over again.
[118:28.88]There's one thing that I really liked in the second game.
[118:38.78]The first game was sort of, I don't think, I mean, maybe they did.
[118:42.45]I don't know.
[118:42.77]I don't know if he thought this was something that he was going to do later.
[118:45.19]The first game felt like a complete package.
[118:47.45]Just, oh, it's a Suda51 game.
[118:48.97]It's No More Heroes.
[118:50.33]This is it.
[118:51.05]Cool.
[118:51.33]It was a fun experience and I made it.
[118:53.46]But No More Heroes 2 and 3 and then having all these other things in the franchise.
[118:58.44]No More Heroes 1 is this almost enclosed in its own place.
[119:01.68]Did the game just end?
[119:04.16]No.
[119:04.26]No.
[119:05.27]Those of you that were just catching the stream, no, no.
[119:09.50]It's like a fake anime with intros and outros.
[119:28.95]This is by far the most, like, fun.
[119:34.02]And fun doesn't mean, like, actually playing the physical video game either, right?
[119:37.34]A lot of times.
[119:40.08]Fun is just the whole package sometimes.
[119:42.56]Like watching the cutscenes and the boss fights that aren't really boss fights.
[119:46.31]They're kind of just there to be fun and interesting.
[119:48.75]It's not about just like swinging the sword at people.
[119:51.69]It's the most fun Star Wars movie.
[120:10.21]So what rank?
[120:10.93]What was it?
[120:11.51]Rank six?
[120:15.56]Time for a pee break?
[120:16.32]Actually, that's a great idea.
[120:22.00]After this next cutscene, we'll take a quick break.
[120:26.28]Where's Damon?
[120:27.56]He said he would be out on his monthly glamping trip today.
[120:30.87]Oh, that guy is such a hassle.
[120:33.89]What's up with Velvet Chair Girl?
[120:35.93]She called in saying she could not make it due to an appointment at the nail salon.
[120:41.33]I see.
[120:42.79]So she couldn't make it, huh?
[120:45.02]Was it really such an important appointment?
[120:48.24]It is for her nails, so... Okay, I'll let this one slide.
[120:52.72]Seriously, women are the biggest hassle of them all.
[120:56.68]Both humans and aliens are a hassle.
[121:00.32]Oh, here it goes.
[121:07.77]The intro.
[121:10.15]Don't ever skip the intro.
[121:13.71]How many times have you ever skipped an intro accidentally?
[121:15.61]And you get pissed?
[121:17.81]Or you're too lazy to go back and watch it?
[121:19.46]But you're really just sort of secretly incredibly annoyed.
[121:37.88]How do you accidentally do that?
[121:40.22]Um, I don't know.
[121:40.80]Sometimes you just press the button.
[121:42.14]Sometimes, like, if you have, like, a touchscreen.
[121:43.91]Or if you have, like, an Apple TV or something.
[121:47.69]Or you have, like, a remote.
[121:48.65]Nope, I don't think so.
[121:49.97]You're just hella wrong.
[121:51.29]You're hella wrong.
[121:51.81]You accidentally press left on your console controller.
[121:54.07]If you're doing it on, like, PS4 or PS5.
[121:55.72]Oh, shit.
[121:56.60]Miike never read the original.
[121:58.54]The script is what's most important.
[122:00.88]The script is what the entire art form is based on.
[122:04.34]Terraformers.
[122:36.37]Ooh, got a new t-shirt.
[122:37.05]Oh wait, important.
[122:42.33]Cat.
[122:43.45]Cat, check wardrobe and NP.
[122:46.73]No, I'm not throwing the ball again.
[122:47.87]Okay, uh, this is with this hoodie on.
[123:01.30]Yeah.
[123:07.73]Okay, I just want to see what the shirts look like.
[123:09.81]Didn't I get new shirts?
[123:20.20]Where is it?
[123:20.60]Otaku freak.
[123:29.96]Flame tea.
[123:31.43]Ooh.
[123:36.42]Oh, there it is.
[123:36.88]I like that one a lot.
[123:43.16]I really like this, though.
[123:44.23]I actually really like this.
[123:45.45]I'm going to wear this until I get some more clothes.
[124:04.16]I like it.
[124:15.20]You did no progress and you saved.
[124:16.52]I know, I just do it because I sometimes do.
[124:20.19]I just like, it's like a nervous habit in a way.
[124:22.35]Just like, okay, save.
[124:22.93]Press button.
[124:23.49]Okay, good.
[124:23.77]Alright, I'll be right back.
[124:24.94]Time to go pee.
[124:26.06]See you guys in like a minute or two.
[127:41.42]Okay, I'm back.
[127:44.02]I just was laughing in the bathroom.
[127:45.48]I just keep thinking of the insanity of that last fight.
[127:49.51]It was all over the place.
[127:51.93]I couldn't even process.
[127:53.41]I just went into full-blown panic mode.
[127:58.63]Okay.
[128:01.25]I gotta get out of here.
[128:07.42]So we are rank 7, so the next fight is 6.
[128:12.06]Very, very cool.
[128:16.60]Hey.
[128:20.68]Huh.
[128:25.89]We have Germaplexus back?
[128:27.47]I don't remember what Germaplexus is.
[128:40.66]Are we gonna get a cutscene here?
[128:42.50]I will shush up.
[128:55.85]No?
[128:57.43]No?
[128:57.87]Okay.
[129:00.17]Get on the highway and head to Call of Battle.
[129:02.23]Check my mail.
[129:07.03]Rank 6 is 35,000 coins.
[129:15.36]Oceans 51.
[129:15.72]Alright, let's head to the... This is a new zone, I think, right?
[129:22.81]Call of Battle?
[129:31.58]What are you drinking?
[129:33.26]Uh, it's nice coffee.
[129:36.56]Is it ice?
[129:38.12]Coffee.
[129:38.40]Are you still bleeding?
[129:44.21]No.
[129:47.35]If you get a cut in your mouth, it's weird how it bleeds really badly for 5 to 10 seconds, and then it's just immediately sealed.
[130:00.47]It's really weird.
[130:01.01]It's just like, oh, oh my god, I can taste blood.
[130:06.34]I'm bleeding.
[130:07.46]Gone.
[130:08.02]Not anymore.
[130:08.60]Healed.
[130:10.50]Why is the mouth so... Mouth heals super fast.
[130:13.80]Yeah, but why?
[130:14.38]Why?
[130:15.87]What makes the mouth so different versus getting a cut on your finger?
[130:21.33]Iron?
[130:24.57]This is ugly.
[130:25.59]Holy shit.
[130:28.51]I just want to get to my destination quickly.
[130:30.18]Five figures.
[130:37.64]It's because it's saliva.
[130:42.36]Rapid cell replication.
[130:46.70]Damn, this is an ugly zone.
[130:47.69]Is he giving me double middle finger?
[130:48.71]What was that?
[130:51.71]Okay, designated matches.
[130:55.25]This place is ugly!
[130:56.55]I feel like I'm looking at this with 3D glasses.
[131:10.43]To a movie or a thing that is not supposed to be 3D.
[131:23.56]Gears of War 1.
[131:25.36]You know I've never played any of the Gears of War games.
[131:28.36]That might freak a lot of people up.
[131:30.54]I've never played Gears of War for even 15 seconds.
[131:33.16]Alright, let's go.
[131:58.47]We played 14 seconds.
[132:00.71]Uh, I don't know.
[132:01.39]I don't know what that is.
[132:03.85]The answer is probably no.
[132:06.46]I was gonna get a double kill right here.
[132:10.62]Hit them both!
[132:12.64]Yeah!
[132:17.04]Go crazy, let's go.
[132:22.02]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
[132:23.92]Ow!
[132:24.91]Hurry!
[132:25.95]Ow!
[132:26.39]Whatever.
[132:29.22]Oh my god, this is the worst enemy in the game for me.
[132:35.70]It's the worst enemy in the game for me.
[132:37.88]I hate this enemy.
[132:39.46]It sucks.
[132:48.18]What the fuck?
[132:51.12]Do all your moves, take up the whole screen!
[133:01.91]Don't!
[133:02.36]Fuck!
[133:27.50]Oh, sorry!
[133:31.35]Where'd you go?
[133:32.93]Where'd you go?
[133:33.97]Where'd you go?
[133:34.27]Did I destroy the eggs?
[133:41.81]Just- I'm gonna beat the eggs up.
[133:45.33]Oh, fuck you.
[134:04.10]What was the Peter Griffin thing?
[134:09.10]Oh, it's me, Peter Griffin.
[134:11.60]I'm playing The Sims.
[134:13.13]I remember that was so embarrassing, man.
[134:46.39]I'm gonna push you out of the fucking zone.
[134:49.14]Get the cute shit out of here.
[135:03.53]That enemy is the- I'm not gonna do the fucking like you slowed down 0.25x on YouTube joke again.
[135:10.07]You heard it before.
[135:26.70]When has that ever stopped you before?
[135:27.98]Yeah, you're right.
[135:37.87]Somebody said it was literally Gears of War's fault for all the cover shooter bullshit that swept the whole industry.
[135:51.53]I never really played it, so... But yeah, I do remember pressing right bumper against any surface.
[135:59.10]It was a really big deal for a long time.
[136:01.70]Hey.
[136:16.55]Oh, this stuff over here.
[136:17.75]What is it?
[136:19.62]Oh, it's sushi.
[136:29.75]Chest-high walls everywhere.
[136:36.31]That's right.
[136:37.35]Oh, look sushi.
[136:40.93]Cleanliness first.
[137:04.24]This is your moderators clearing up chat.
[137:14.99]Thousand bucks for that.
[137:16.77]I'm almost halfway there.
[137:17.53]It's because I made a lot of money last time.
[137:19.58]I didn't spend it.
[137:20.10]What?
[137:21.12]What?
[137:39.75]Flog it up again.
[137:43.73]He says berries because it's a reference to an in-universe magical girl anime where all the girls are named after berries.
[137:52.01]Really?
[137:57.70]Refill these.
[137:59.92]I still have not used any of the other ones.
[138:07.50]Strawberry on the shortcake.
[138:11.98]Is that a tank mission?
[138:12.94]Alright, I kind of need to know what that is.
[138:16.69]How do I get in here?
[138:18.59]Yeah, I know he was, um... I know he says it in the first two games, but I never kind of knew why.
[138:30.59]I had a feeling it was something anime related, but I didn't really know.
[138:51.53]Alright.
[138:55.53]And... hi.
[138:56.31]Bye.
[138:58.25]And... hello.
[138:59.39]Hello.
[139:00.45]And let's go!
[139:06.52]Those things shouldn't be able to explode at regular speed inside my vault.
[139:18.71]Did you guys find that incredibly infuriating?
[139:20.90]Come on, do a move then.
[139:28.20]If your buddy's not there, you're dead.
[139:31.23]You know what?
[139:44.32]Very good.
[139:44.76]Very good.
[139:46.12]Very good.
[139:47.24]Go crazy.
[139:53.72]I actually hate these enemies.
[139:55.16]I hate these stupid balls.
[139:56.21]They're annoying.
[140:01.09]What is that?
[140:04.81]Your next lot effect will always be Mustang mode.
[140:09.51]Really?
[140:09.83]Holy shit.
[140:11.27]I'm going to clear this in a second.
[140:16.80]Give me a thing so I can slash.
[140:23.71]You're so annoying.
[140:25.43]Give me the slot.
[140:26.07]And...
[140:50.59]Okay, 88 hit combo.
[140:57.34]That's gotta be worth at least an A. That was less than a minute.
[141:18.74]I took a lot of damage, but whatever.
[141:21.32]Uh-oh.
[141:30.17]This shit again.
[141:42.19]Okay.
[141:47.76]Where is he?
[141:53.61]Where are you, huh?
[141:54.77]Across the road.
[141:56.75]I can't really see you.
[142:03.68]Is that so?
[142:05.76]But you're becoming able to see me more than before, yes?
[142:11.56]I heard I can ask for anything I want.
[142:14.88]Of course.
[142:16.44]As long as you pay the appropriate price.
[142:20.54]Even murder?
[142:23.05]I don't dabble in such vulgarity.
[142:26.29]However, I am able to perform actions that would result in death.
[142:30.78]Is there really a difference?
[142:34.30]Of course there's a difference.
[142:38.24]Can you kill anyone?
[142:40.52]That's what you wish.
[142:41.34]The problem lies in why exactly you want the person in question dead.
[142:48.43]Why?
[142:48.69]Do you need a reason?
[142:52.71]Yes.
[142:54.01]That's part of the price you must pay.
[142:57.15]Think about that first.
[142:58.83]Money comes after that.
[143:01.29]The reason I want them dead is... Hello?
[143:06.23]Hello?
[143:07.47]Are you there?
[143:08.49]The line's dead.
[143:09.82]Oh, never mind.
[143:10.92]I can't hear you.
[143:12.42]You're still not fully prepared.
[143:15.24]Let's speak again later.
[143:23.57]Are you actually gonna finish you Kriza?
[143:41.75]I shouldn't have laughed at that.
[143:43.27]I'm sorry.
[143:43.64]I just laughed like in your face But I mean that I did not expect to answer that question today I'm really I should not have laughed at that
[143:51.57]Um, that's not what my intention was.
[143:55.64]That was a laugh out of nervousness.
[143:58.76]That was really rude, it was.
[144:00.78]Alligators are taking over the beach.
[144:01.88]I'd like to test out your fortitude.
[144:03.52]Please go enlist with the Coast Guard.
[144:07.88]Coast Guard?
[144:08.54]Help to quell the mass panic.
[144:10.12]Fight off the alligators riding in on tanks.
[144:14.55]Okay.
[144:24.71]What?
[144:26.17]You know what this reminds me of?
[144:31.93]This reminds me of the VR shit that you can play in the mall.
[144:37.44]Like it sucks absolute asshole.
[144:41.62]And it's like not good.
[144:43.06]It feels like it's from VR tech from like 15 years ago.
[144:47.10]Like an Oculus Quest is better.
[144:48.52]Right?
[144:57.30]Am I almost out of time?
[144:58.26]I don't understand.
[145:09.28]How am I gonna have to kill?
[145:11.30]Oh, it's just a tutorial.
[145:13.60]Mall VR is what made me buy Oculus Quest.
[145:20.82]That's true, because it's really, like, it's a watered-down version of what you can actually do in VR.
[145:25.93]So, just maybe gets you interested.
[145:29.63]What's wrong with the quest?
[145:30.63]There's nothing wrong with the quest.
[145:31.45]I'm just saying, like, the quest is better than the huge, gigantic system that's in the mall.
[145:39.20]Some of them might even be on quests now.
[145:53.02]Lots is wrong with the quest.
[145:54.52]I've never used it.
[145:59.90]Alright, let's do this now.
[146:02.20]Focus.
[146:12.19]I gotta have an efficient way to do this.
[146:16.87]I missed?
[146:17.33]What?
[146:18.03]Ow.
[146:24.13]They were in the middle.
[146:37.94]That's a hit.
[146:44.27]This is actually scary.
[146:49.45]I've had nightmares where this happens.
[146:52.63]Off in the distance, gigantic monsters destroying a city or coming out of the water.
[146:55.73]I've had this nightmare before.
[147:13.36]Oh my goodness.
[147:14.08]Okay.
[147:16.91]You can double kill?
[147:17.95]I don't think that was supposed to happen.
[147:21.31]I feel like I'm playing... What's that game?
[147:33.88]With bugs.
[147:34.40]You fight off the gigantic bugs.
[147:36.50]It feels exactly like I'm playing that.
[147:41.64]Why can I not think of that?
[147:42.78]What is what that is?
[147:48.80]Holy shit.
[147:49.50]He's big.
[147:54.72]I got him.
[147:55.73]I killed them all.
[148:01.65]EDF.
[148:02.03]Right.
[148:02.23]Earthbansport.
[148:07.43]You see that?
[148:14.51]Gold?
[148:14.99]I think that was better than gold.
[148:26.84]It's a reminder for you to give our daily Otto update to tell us everything about Otto.
[148:31.78]I want level 2.
[148:33.92]Uh, Otto's great.
[148:39.23]He's doing really well.
[148:41.37]He's nice and happy.
[148:45.17]This is level 2, what makes this harder?
[148:46.80]I imagine this probably does get much harder.
[149:02.63]Easy way to make money though.
[149:11.68]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[149:12.65]They run fast.
[149:13.41]They run faster.
[149:14.13]Oh, God.
[149:15.53]That's terrifying.
[149:18.67]You got to start to prioritize enemies now.
[149:20.67]Alright.
[149:21.01]I get it.
[149:23.02]Why is that one red?
[149:23.70]Why are they red?
[149:35.29]Oh, they walk in different directions.
[149:36.67]I get it.
[149:42.04]This is scary.
[149:42.68]I don't like this.
[149:53.05]Oh!
[149:54.95]Whoa!
[149:56.25]Good.
[150:03.32]Missed.
[150:03.80]Come on.
[150:22.47]He'll die Hit him in the head do more damage and does that does that not even matter I bet it doesn't matter Oh Whoa, no, I missed fuck you.
[150:38.60]What are you serious?
[150:40.50]I how did I burn under the armpit?
[150:43.02]Whatever
[150:48.82]He raised his hand up and I shot under his arm.
[150:51.26]Alright, we're good.
[150:56.45]Targeted and firing.
[151:02.83]Yeah, this motherfucker raised up his armpit.
[151:06.91]Well, now I know what happens.
[151:07.67]Hit!
[151:07.75]Hit!
[151:08.77]Hit!
[151:10.13]Hit!
[151:13.68]Hit!
[151:16.73]So it's not based on when they decide to run.
[151:18.41]It's who comes up first is who runs first.
[151:21.43]They had that messed up.
[151:23.55]I was assuming the person that was in front was going to run fast.
[151:27.41]They go in order.
[151:28.25]Yes!
[151:45.15]Shit.
[151:45.53]OK, here comes the big guy in second here.
[152:06.82]Big guy coming up.
[152:28.47]Okay, go.
[152:29.27]What is he worth?
[152:35.13]How many points?
[152:40.40]500?
[152:46.62]Okay.
[152:47.12]That's where I died.
[152:53.74]Okay.
[153:00.87]I got it.
[153:03.89]It really does look like a dream.
[153:07.52]Yeah, it feels like a dream.
[153:08.78]It's creepy.
[153:12.94]Somebody said that level 3 is really the actually hard one.
[153:18.26]Find out.
[153:18.61]It'd be available, right?
[153:24.77]Level 3?
[153:27.93]I guess not yet.
[153:29.73]Later.
[153:30.01]Okay, cool.
[153:35.03]Damn it.
[153:36.39]Alright, well, there's a fight right here.
[153:46.03]Come on, I don't want to walk that way.
[153:47.83]I'll just walk, fine.
[153:58.55]Right here.
[154:07.86]Do I still play VR games?
[154:10.06]Yeah, I've taken a break from VR just because it really, really, really fucked me up last time.
[154:22.21]Breakdancing and getting thrown through a window at the dollhouse for some reason was not even remotely as bad as streaming VR for a few days.
[154:29.98]I don't know.
[154:31.46]It just kills me now.
[154:38.33]Something about the headset being on and how hot it gets in there and the movement and standing and all the motions.
[154:48.69]It was a lot.
[154:49.17]It was just horrible.
[154:49.89]Alright, come on.
[154:57.52]This feels like I'm playing Resident Evil 1 Silent Hill or something.
[155:12.12]I really would like to get out of this area.
[155:14.58]It hurts.
[155:28.24]Game's resolution keeps getting worse.
[155:31.54]And we keep losing a couple hundred pixels in either direction.
[155:38.62]Let's get this over with.
[155:41.69]Oh, this is going to be, this is going to suck.
[155:52.52]Keep him in here.
[155:55.22]Pick him up.
[156:08.85]Dodged it.
[156:09.61]Alright, this was really clean.
[156:11.57]Did I get a kill here?
[156:12.29]This is funny.
[156:14.12]Really clean.
[156:14.86]And give me Mustang right now.
[156:17.12]And let's go for it.
[156:19.50]Bro crazy.
[156:20.50]I can't even pick these guys up.
[156:22.54]I can't even touch these guys.
[156:26.54]Yeah.
[156:26.88]No.
[156:27.18]What's the... They have like these stupid ass shields.
[156:36.19]Screw Crusher Death Kick!
[156:48.66]Just start hitting people.
[156:55.31]God, you're fucking with my flow, honest to God.
[157:27.62]Well, one of you die already.
[157:29.38]Fucking puff.
[157:40.47]Come on.
[157:44.29]Oh.
[157:46.43]Okay.
[157:47.41]We got a raid?
[157:55.54]Shit, hold on.
[157:57.29]Oh, give it to me!
[157:57.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[158:02.11]Good, good, good, good, good.
[158:02.91]That's exactly what I wanted to have happen.
[158:06.42]I just saved the whole run.
[158:14.76]Thank God.
[158:15.20]Okay.
[158:16.36]We got a raid?
[158:17.10]We're raiding.
[158:21.12]Jimmy here!
[158:23.31]Jimmy here with a... That's a big raid.
[158:25.01]We got 1,500 people just showed up.
[158:28.46]Welcome, everybody.
[158:28.98]How you doing?
[158:30.52]Thank you, Jimmy.
[158:31.56]Thanks for the raid.
[158:34.13]Raid song?
[158:38.67]Oh, I haven't done raid songs since, like, 2019.
[158:39.75]Oh, no raid songs.
[158:46.05]Welcome.
[158:46.73]Playing No More Heroes 3.
[158:48.59]I love it so far.
[158:49.79]We're about, I'd say, probably halfway through the game, so if you're gonna play it yourself, just, you know, be aware.
[158:54.53]You might see things you don't want to see.
[158:56.99]We're about six to seven hours into the total gameplay.
[159:02.38]Raid song, fine.
[159:04.04]Welcome to the stream.
[159:05.28]I think you're the best.
[159:07.04]Welcome to the stream.
[159:08.08]Now this is a test.
[159:09.76]Welcome to the stream.
[159:10.96]Will the raiders stay?
[159:13.04]Welcome to the stream.
[159:15.41]Hey, after I scream this shit, let's see how many you leave.
[159:29.00]I was just in there, come on.
[159:31.69]Do I have enough money?
[159:32.27]35, right?
[159:34.99]Yeah, I don't have enough.
[159:38.47]Spoken word is not a song.
[159:51.65]You know what this actually feels like?
[159:53.37]And it's weird because this was a game that was on that console.
[159:56.47]This feels like a shitload of original Wii games.
[160:01.18]Damn, were they ugly.
[160:02.76]They were so ugly.
[160:05.30]Some of them were so ugly that it was almost impossible to play them.
[160:17.31]I remember having a Wii and other people having a 360.
[160:21.40]And anytime a game that had decent, in quotes, graphics on the Wii came out, it was always a big deal you tried to make to your friends.
[160:27.24]Like, yeah, look, it looks pretty good.
[160:30.30]And deep down, you know that this is supposed to be the good graphics.
[160:33.91]And everybody's judging you.
[160:37.69]And you're even judging you.
[160:48.96]I remember selecting.
[160:49.90]You guys remember switching cables on the Wii?
[160:55.16]And it was like an Omega Chad moment.
[160:57.57]Because you switch to component cables and could do 480p.
[161:00.29]Here we go.
[161:00.63]720.
[161:00.67]I get progressive scan now.
[161:16.89]Yeah, I remember the old MegaChad moment of just plugging in the blue cable.
[161:22.21]Like, yo, bro, I got the blue fucking cable.
[161:25.30]Oh, you got the Chad cables.
[161:26.80]Yep.
[161:27.32]Of course I did.
[161:29.62]Based 480i.
[161:30.40]What's that?
[161:38.93]Low armor standing by.
[161:41.41]Oh, let's go.
[161:50.07]We have not seen this in-game yet.
[161:55.09]Holy shit, I just killed everybody.
[162:06.16]480p has a nostalgic, comfy amount of crust.
[162:08.64]I actually liked 480p.
[162:09.41]I remember switching from 480i to 480p for the first time.
[162:20.29]It's a double S. When I switched from 480i to like 480p, you guys remember the Wii used to have a little bit of input lag?
[162:27.95]And when you switched, you had that kind of sloppy, maybe 50 millisecond, 100 millisecond response delay.
[162:35.76]And when you select 480p, it was almost one to one.
[162:42.22]It was literally the 480i to 480p Nintendo Wii was like having a 120 hertz monitor the first time.
[162:53.25]It was world changing.
[162:59.45]Yeah, it was like going from 30 to 60 FPS.
[163:05.03]Alright, I got enough.
[163:09.98]There was an ATM.
[163:10.52]I'm actually pretty close to one.
[163:15.76]Hold on.
[163:16.68]There's a lot of question marks here.
[163:27.42]GameCube component cables go for like $400.
[163:31.37]They make adapters for the Wii.
[163:32.85]That are HDMI.
[163:35.53]And it forces the game... If you put a GameCube game in, it forces progressive mode.
[163:40.45]Which is really cool, actually.
[163:41.45]A lot of times you've seen me play GameCube are with the HDMI adapter in a Wii.
[164:03.46]Fake pirated game?
[164:10.43]Fake pirated game is just you bought the game, dude.
[164:13.63]How do you fake a pirated game?
[164:33.36]Cleanliness first.
[164:36.60]VR is going to get scary technology in the future.
[164:41.82]Yeah, it is.
[164:42.38]It's already kind of scary now.
[164:55.01]What else is over here?
[164:55.61]There's tons of stuff.
[164:56.43]There's a trash cleanup.
[164:59.45]I'll do that.
[165:02.59]There is a... one of these?
[165:03.85]I couldn't even see that on the ground.
[165:05.35]Okay.
[165:14.06]Ooh.
[165:16.24]Acquire a total of over 10,000 Utopicoins.
[165:20.37]I have that.
[165:21.61]I want that.
[165:22.19]I like that shirt a lot.
[165:31.64]How am I doing on Sushi?
[165:32.82]I'm about to fight the boss.
[165:43.60]It's now more of a fun thing than a scary thing.
[165:45.16]It's really easy to tell the difference.
[165:46.90]Yeah, once they make... And I don't know.
[165:48.50]Here's the thing.
[165:50.06]I don't think there's ever going to be a point where we can tell the difference.
[165:53.76]At least in our lifetimes.
[165:56.90]Well, we can't tell the difference is what I mean.
[166:01.76]This is like kind of, oh, real life VR type shit.
[166:05.10]You know how many pixels it would take just to get somebody's realistic face photo realistic to show up on your screen?
[166:15.48]It would take an incredible amount of computer power.
[166:18.62]So you and I are not going to see that.
[166:22.20]Maybe a few, I don't know, few generations ahead of us.
[166:25.92]Depends on how quantum computing goes.
[166:31.35]You and I aren't going to see it.
[166:33.15]Maybe somebody else will.
[166:35.75]But... And I'll tell you, I'm kind of happy I won't.
[166:39.53]Because it's going to be really weird.
[166:43.60]That real life is going to be... It's going to be so uncanny valley.
[166:53.37]I like being able to tell the difference.
[166:54.73]Even if it's really good looking.
[166:58.33]Being able to actually tell the difference lets us exist in both spaces.
[167:04.51]Because once you can't separate fiction from reality, what the fuck even is reality anymore?
[167:11.91]I don't like that.
[167:12.97]I like to be able to separate them.
[167:19.93]I don't want it to get to that point where I can't tell the difference.
[167:22.39]It terrifies me.
[167:32.56]Everything's just a lucid dream at that point?
[167:34.38]Yeah.
[167:35.24]Ah, yeah.
[167:35.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[167:36.92]No thanks.
[167:38.42]Shut up and stream, gamer boy.
[167:41.72]Shut up and stream, gamer boy.
[167:43.22]And now that's what happens when I'm not even looking.
[167:44.75]Uh, where is it?
[167:52.01]Head to the motel parking lot.
[167:54.23]Oh, okay.
[167:54.57]Well, we can just pass through.
[167:57.71]Shut up and stream, gamer boy.
[168:12.95]I imagine like a hacker sends you like a video of your mother Like freaking out and like crying and screaming and shit It's not it's not even real but technology has gotten to the point where you can fake everything and it's not even like the deep fakes.
[168:31.65]Oh It's a deep fake no, no, it's like it's just you can't even tell the difference between fucking fact and fiction
[168:44.90]MonkaW, yeah.
[168:47.51]We MonkaW at deepfakes right now.
[168:59.20]The one thing that I would be happy with, with, like, the kind of technology of not being able to tell the difference, is, like, somebody kind of just mentioned it a little bit.
[169:05.56]Like, imagine somebody just had made a realistic, like, in real life, you're watching reality of, like, Richard Nixon, like, fighting, like, fucking, like, I don't know, like, the Quaker Oats guy in, like, a wrestling ring.
[169:17.33]Like, that's kind of funny, right?
[169:22.83]And if you couldn't even tell the difference, it's just, like, actual video footage.
[169:28.46]I already did this.
[169:36.86]That was a very strange example.
[169:41.04]Or like a realistic, real life of... Let's just use Richard Nixon again.
[169:44.64]Like they just make him like a pop star.
[169:48.69]And he has like singles and shit.
[169:50.53]It could be anybody.
[169:51.39]They could like break... Like Abraham Lincoln could have like a... Like songs and like movies.
[169:55.09]And it would just be him.
[169:58.84]Like, we... Okay, here we go.
[169:59.90]I'm gonna get really existential here.
[170:01.04]Are you ready?
[170:04.04]He... This is really existential scary shit.
[170:06.04]You ready for this?
[170:06.46]I don't know if you guys are ready for this.
[170:07.60]I don't know if it's... It's too early for this.
[170:11.46]If we have a world where we can just... It's so realistic that you can't tell the difference, people don't die.
[170:19.26]Huh?
[170:23.32]Yeah?
[170:25.12]Yeah?
[170:28.48]People will always be able to exist.
[170:31.08]Terrifying.
[170:33.11]Look at that.
[170:34.83]Smoke on that one for a little while.
[170:42.64]Black Mirror already did this five years ago.
[170:44.66]I don't... I don't care if Family Guy did a reference to that.
[170:48.25]I don't care.
[170:49.19]You and I are having a conversation right now.
[170:51.61]Alright, let me get... Okay, listen to this.
[170:53.67]If you and I are having a conversation in a living room, where I'm sitting on a couch, you're sitting on the chair across from me, and I'm like, man, you know, let's just talk in like existential stuff.
[171:03.30]Like, can you imagine, like, I got something for you.
[171:05.08]Imagine how fucked up it is, like, when you can't tell the difference between, like, fact and fiction.
[171:08.61]It's going to be so fucking crazy.
[171:10.19]And you just leaned in and said, they did a Black Mirror episode about that.
[171:12.55]Stop talking to me.
[171:14.53]Alright.
[171:15.93]Hey, dude, I saw a funny thing today.
[171:17.37]Dude, you know Captain Crunch?
[171:19.29]Dude, it, like, cuts the roof of my mouth all the time.
[171:22.08]Like, what the fuck?
[171:23.26]Family Guy did that joke already three years ago.
[171:26.06]Shut up.
[171:27.56]I, okay.
[171:27.80]Okay.
[171:35.50]You're so stoned.
[171:40.18]Chat canceled.
[171:43.90]Alright, I'll make it back to the game.
[171:46.01]We got like a bunch of new people here.
[171:47.57]Come on, Gwyn.
[171:52.89]Don't cross over just yet.
[171:54.04]You must not chase after the swan on the other side of the lake when the rain falls.
[171:59.26]That little girl is dangerous.
[172:00.21]You'll get sucked down to the deepest depths of your subconscious.
[172:03.63]The beautiful landscape and the melancholic melody are just lures.
[172:07.65]Stay away.
[172:08.11]I can hear Birkin's voice.
[172:10.07]Your daddy doesn't want to see you just yet.
[172:11.75]What am I- This is fucking weird.
[172:13.05]What am I doing?
[172:22.09]Dude, imagine like... Never mind.
[172:25.79]Dude, imagine like the world, like when technology gets so crazy, you know, it's me and you're just hanging out talking.
[172:32.90]Shut up, Simpsons watcher.
[172:34.18]Did I save the game?
[172:39.49]Wait, I gotta upgrade.
[173:00.37]I'm past the joint already.
[173:01.71]I don't have any toys.
[173:04.81]Where do I get the toys?
[173:05.61]I have no toys.
[173:07.29]This sucks.
[173:23.18]Wayne's World already did that.
[173:31.32]And I know the song they did, too.
[173:34.20]Ballroom Blitz, Blitz, Blitz.
[173:36.50]Ballroom Blitz, Blitz, Blitz.
[173:39.43]And the girl in the corner said, Everybody wanna hear a new ballroom blitz.
[173:43.59]And the girl in the corner said, Everybody wanna... Yeah, I've seen that movie.
[173:47.07]I've seen that scene.
[173:48.81]That doesn't mean we can't have a conversation about it.
[173:50.59]Alright, I have $6,300.
[174:01.81]I'm going to just, yeah, I got to do this.
[174:05.61]I got to go down this path because I want the double dodge.
[174:12.11]Hold X to charge your beam katana.
[174:15.19]Leaves you so vulnerable, though.
[174:16.35]Takes too long.
[174:20.41]I'm going to dump it into this because I want to be able to get that immediately after this.
[174:28.82]That's skill level one.
[174:31.95]Why is it death skill level one?
[174:36.08]Oh, shit.
[174:38.42]Right.
[174:38.84]That's what this is.
[174:39.54]Alright.
[174:40.74]I'll do that again.
[174:42.30]Do it after this.
[174:45.02]Okay.
[174:50.94]Alright.
[174:51.82]I think I'm good.
[174:59.79]Any chance of a face cam?
[175:00.77]Not with this nudity.
[175:07.37]Would you ever like to be immortal?
[175:09.59]No.
[175:11.61]Although, I can't lie, I don't ever want to be immortal, but I think I would want to live a thousand years.
[175:17.17]I think that's enough.
[175:20.09]Maybe less, maybe 500.
[175:27.01]Or, you know what, like, okay.
[175:29.97]Maybe like 150.
[175:32.69]And you don't really start to actually get old until 130, 140.
[175:35.66]A thousand might be too long.
[175:43.14]What about immortal with the chance of ending it on your own when you want to?
[175:46.10]No, I don't like that, and I'll tell you why.
[175:48.31]So, if you have the choice to just turn it off, when are you going to turn it off?
[175:54.27]Just one day you flip a switch?
[175:56.95]Okay, that's it.
[175:59.20]I don't think anyone would actually be able to do that.
[176:04.76]It would be a really tough thing to do.
[176:06.06]Because I imagine, like, the two or three lifetimes of different people.
[176:15.76]It's a lot, yeah, it's a lot of, like, responsibility.
[176:18.10]To be able to, like, okay, I can turn the switch off.
[176:22.76]Like, I imagine, like, me right now.
[176:25.45]It's been, like, 600 years.
[176:26.95]I don't know.
[176:28.75]Part of me would just sit there and kind of be like...
[176:31.37]You know, I wonder if Bitcoin's gonna be like 60 million dollars.
[176:34.20]Like, I gotta stay alive, right?
[176:38.88]What if the- Okay, hold on.
[176:39.76]I gotta stay alive.
[176:40.36]What if the US dollar is worth like 600 million US dollars in one dollar?
[176:44.50]Like, I kinda need to know.
[176:48.66]Are aliens gonna show up?
[176:51.96]Well, I wanna- Okay, what if I turn it off, and then like a week later, the aliens show up?
[176:56.58]I kinda wanna see it.
[177:02.80]What do cars look like?
[177:03.68]Are there cars?
[177:07.88]What happens to roads?
[177:11.01]I feel like I would have a list of like endgame of things that I thought were like, okay, like economic stuff.
[177:16.49]What does a stock market look like?
[177:17.95]What does like cryptocurrency look like?
[177:20.07]What does the world look like?
[177:21.39]What do world powers look like?
[177:22.81]I think I'd have a checklist of things that I would want to see how they played out.
[177:32.97]What happens in the Marvel Universe?
[177:37.57]Yeah, what happens in phase 35 of the MCU?
[177:41.29]I need to know.
[177:49.08]Yeah, I don't know.
[177:49.60]I kind of would want to like see how the world plays out in a lot of very kind of maybe specific ways.
[177:54.56]But when would I turn it off though?
[178:01.07]I don't know, what if I, okay, what if I fulfill those things?
[178:03.05]What if, like, okay, uh, by the way, the, uh, the stock market went to zero, and, uh, fucking Silk has replaced the US economy.
[178:12.79]Oh, alright, cool.
[178:13.91]Now what?
[178:14.43]Like, when does it end?
[178:15.81]The number six ranked assassin is Velvet Chair Girl.
[178:19.69]She is the intergalactic musical chairs champion.
[178:23.26]She works with Oma, who has a huge gastro-gun.
[178:27.70]Turn it off before the sun explodes.
[178:33.32]So what, you're saying that like, wait, okay, I'm looking at the sun and it's been like another four or five thousand years and I see it start to shake a little.
[178:42.83]The sun's shaking a little bit and turning bright orange.
[178:47.59]And then I look up and I'm just like, yep, switch off, off, off, off.
[178:52.05]Is that what you're saying?
[178:53.85]Or do you wait till you see the, when do you do it?
[179:00.74]Sun is shaking, it's making sounds, and then it just implodes and starts waving towards us.
[179:06.68]And then flip, switch off.
[179:10.00]There's a billion years left on the planet before that happens.
[179:18.23]I don't want to live a billion years, I'm sorry.
[179:20.03]I don't have any money, so I can't buy anything anyways.
[179:26.31]Although I could do one of the little ones, yeah.
[179:30.80]Oh, I actually can't.
[179:31.58]I can't afford anything.
[179:36.07]Just before it turns into a red giant.
[179:42.40]Um, I... Ugh.
[179:56.47]Living forever would be mad boring at some point.
[179:58.49]Like, at some point, you would run out of things to do.
[180:00.15]Yeah.
[180:06.97]It would be kind of boring after a while.
[180:10.07]Honestly, after the first, like, I think, hundred years, I think it'd be like, well, fuck, there's only so many times I can go to Disney World.
[180:18.91]Before I've, I've shaked hands with Mickey Mouse, like, 400 times already.
[180:22.59]Like, how many more times can I do that?
[180:26.45]I've traveled the world a hundred times over.
[180:28.79]What else do I do?
[180:29.47]Should I try to... Okay.
[180:32.09]Here's a question for you guys, though.
[180:33.27]If I'm immortal, does that count for other planets?
[180:36.33]Like, do I breathe oxygen still?
[180:40.14]Like, could you just shoot me in a rocket into space and could I, like, try to find another planet or something?
[180:46.30]Do I need to... Do I have to breathe oxygen?
[180:49.24]Or could I actually... Could you just shoot me in a rocket into a random planet in space?
[180:53.61]Just give me a deck of cards and I'll play solitaire for like a thousand years.
[181:01.19]Immortal does not mean invincible.
[181:02.75]Right.
[181:06.65]Your mind would break?
[181:12.66]But what if I said to make... Okay.
[181:14.82]So I'm not invincible.
[181:15.62]So I'm just a person though.
[181:16.90]Would I be a person or could I withstand a rocket going like 500 times faster?
[181:24.80]I'm just a person.
[181:25.48]Alright, well, look.
[181:33.71]We'll wrap back to this later.
[181:35.59]We have a cutscene.
[181:36.37]And a boss.
[181:36.83]Ooh.
[181:40.26]Ooh.
[181:47.14]Wow, what a beautiful place.
[181:50.18]Yeah, it's a bit too over the top.
[181:53.90]Looks like public funds spent badly.
[181:56.28]It's a form of culture, you know.
[181:58.37]I don't think so.
[181:59.43]I mean, what even is... I don't want to talk about this all night.
[182:03.05]Yeah, well, first let's take out this next dickhead.
[182:05.73]Then we'll talk.
[182:08.33]I love that term.
[182:08.89]I love dickhead.
[182:10.93]Today's main event.
[182:13.31]The Galactic title match is about to begin.
[182:17.13]What is going on?
[182:18.07]Please welcome the Galactic champion, Velvet Chair Girl.
[182:26.03]I feel like I'm watching an episode of Xavier Renegade Angel.
[182:31.78]What the hell is this?
[182:33.54]Looks like Las Vegas.
[182:36.10]You know, I actually kind of like this stuff.
[182:42.17]Blaze, I've got to do it.
[182:43.73]It has to happen.
[182:45.45]I don't know.
[182:46.03]Adrian!
[182:47.37]Being immortal, I could never be immortal.
[182:50.23]Or could I?
[182:50.77]That's the question.
[182:58.75]What, musical chairs?
[183:04.52]When the music stops, bolt straight for the closest chair.
[183:07.30]Hit the buttons displayed on the screen in time with the metronome.
[183:11.50]Oh no.
[183:12.20]I don't have this memorized, this controller.
[183:16.97]What?
[183:17.21]Fuck.
[183:34.00]I said to pretend I'm playing Super Mario RPG and I have it memorized if I think I'm playing Mario RPG.
[183:47.39]I swear to god that's how I'm doing this.
[184:15.45]When do I stop doing this?
[184:23.92]How do I stop?
[184:26.98]I got a chair.
[184:30.98]Nice.
[184:33.16]This is just Mario Party with a few extra steps, I think.
[184:42.89]Oh, no.
[184:43.51]Here we go.
[184:51.36]There's only four chairs.
[184:52.30]Oh, what?
[185:00.34]That was quick!
[185:02.69]Okay, there's only two.
[185:15.49]I gotta be ready.
[185:16.16]This blinking is hurting my head.
[185:30.04]I gotta remember where I'm going here, where I am.
[185:35.85]Oh my god, where am I?
[185:37.81]What happened?
[185:38.53]What?
[185:38.73]I did it.
[185:40.29]I just like failed the game.
[185:42.81]What?
[186:04.73]Oh shit, okay.
[186:09.57]This is fast.
[186:27.52]It's so hard when I don't have it memorized completely.
[186:29.52]I just don't.
[186:53.24]What?
[186:53.48]What?
[186:53.72]I win.
[186:54.36]What are you drinking?
[187:25.63]uh what just happened there's one velvet chair girl dead you lost musical chairs so you die no what the hell she killed herself shock of losing was too much for her
[187:52.28]We hadn't even started going at it yet.
[187:54.33]For her, the most important battle was lost.
[187:58.35]Adrian.
[187:59.29]Adrian.
[188:00.35]Oh, no.
[188:01.27]Adrian.
[188:03.95]That monster thing.
[188:05.59]It's getting super weird over here.
[188:07.81]It's freaking out.
[188:08.79]Suicide by orange juice?
[188:15.89]To think that I'd be saving the world.
[188:19.41]Isn't that hilarious?
[188:21.38]Oh boy.
[188:23.04]Okay.
[188:24.90]Here comes the actual fight.
[188:31.15]Whoa!
[188:34.91]Alright.
[188:44.57]That's an instant kill if he touches you.
[188:53.30]Don't let me down, dude.
[188:55.14]Party time.
[188:57.75]We try with one and a half times attack power.
[189:00.33]Thank you for the cheat code.
[189:12.67]pity mode.
[189:13.49]Okay, so what's the strategy here?
[189:21.61]Is that on time?
[189:22.47]Oh!
[189:23.97]Alright, you have to wait until it's a big long one and then you start swinging.
[189:34.02]There you go, now get in.
[189:37.54]Don't get gritty.
[189:39.86]It's about not being gritty.
[189:49.64]It's going to touch me.
[189:52.86]Don't let it touch you.
[189:53.62]Is that hitting?
[189:58.15]Whoa.
[189:58.77]Okay.
[189:59.13]No.
[190:00.05]Okay.
[190:17.52]She's not doing it longer anymore.
[190:21.94]There we go.
[190:30.32]What am I doing?
[190:33.05]That was really stupid.
[190:34.79]Okay, I'm fine.
[190:58.30]Don't let it touch you.
[191:03.04]She's always dead.
[191:06.18]Adrian! Adrian! Adrian.
[191:14.70]I'm out of fucking battery power.
[191:37.56]Adrian!
[191:38.40]Raspberry!
[191:39.10]Adrian!
[191:41.38]Raspberry!
[191:42.52]Strawberry!
[191:44.24]We're just two shitty Pokemons.
[191:48.51]Somebody said that.
[191:49.07]That was funny.
[192:06.68]Oma.
[192:22.33]Omegaloma.
[192:23.07]What a sad sound.
[192:25.09]She's crying.
[192:28.27]It really is just like tears.
[192:36.72]I think I have the extra power.
[192:41.85]Oof, 11,000.
[192:51.62]Congratulations.
[192:54.20]You have been recognized as number six in the galactic rankings.
[192:58.84]I still got a long way to go.
[193:00.18]But this is getting kind of fun.
[193:02.73]If I take down the baddest dude in the galaxy, then I'll be the baddest dude in the galaxy, right?
[193:08.81]Rise up, Travis.
[193:10.51]Higher and higher.
[193:11.89]To the edge of the universe.
[193:13.55]He won by cheating.
[193:15.75]I'm going all the way to the edge.
[193:18.43]Meow.
[193:24.86]Do some fives.
[193:28.37]Midori Midori Kawa.
[193:32.95]I just noticed the planets on the right.
[193:48.22]The Earth is a star.
[193:50.61]Oh, yeah.
[193:53.81]Back to the existential talk.
[193:57.51]I don't even remember what we were talking about.
[193:58.69]We were talking about being immortal.
[194:01.43]And like when you see the sun about to explode, you just like turn it off.
[194:06.31]And then we had... I don't know the rules.
[194:22.66]Immortal means unkillable by definition.
[194:27.43]Hmm... Well... Okay, what about never age, but you can die of anything else?
[194:37.49]Yeah, then, I mean, after like a few hundred years, you would have experienced Disney World 50 times.
[194:43.74]You would have traveled the world 10 times.
[194:45.22]You would have eaten every single food probably 50 times over.
[194:48.36]I think it's like 300 or 400 years.
[195:01.35]You would just die in like a car crash or something.
[195:04.79]Wait, hold on.
[195:10.65]Why am I assuming that I'm going to live for 400 years?
[195:15.43]That's exponentially giving me more time to die by something.
[195:19.70]Like get hit by a bus.
[195:21.68]Or like fall down like a ditch or something.
[195:27.38]Statistically speaking, yes.
[195:29.16]Huh.
[195:34.68]Interesting.
[195:37.82]Statistically speaking, you'd probably be guaranteed to die in a few hundred years.
[195:42.16]Regardless of if I aged or not.
[195:44.60]Shit!
[195:47.27]You know, you don't even really think about that too much.
[195:53.27]What are the chances- somebody look this up.
[195:55.27]What are the chances of somebody being struck by lightning?
[196:00.12]What is that actual chance?
[196:01.24]Because the average person lives to be about, what, 75 to 90 years old?
[196:04.43]Like 80 to 90?
[196:10.98]It's one in what?
[196:11.88]One in like 500,000?
[196:12.73]One in 5 million?
[196:14.13]Hold on.
[196:15.67]Hold that.
[196:16.03]We'll get back to this in a minute.
[196:21.33]If you lived forever, thousands of years, would you statistically be struck by lightning and die at some point?
[196:31.01]I'm going back to work.
[196:32.79]Miss Christelle, I'm leaving him to you.
[196:35.47]Son of a bitch.
[196:42.59]That's not how stats work.
[196:44.53]Right.
[196:45.15]But if you lived for like 50, like 500,000 years on Earth, you probably are going to get struck by lightning and die at some point.
[196:58.00]Just because you're giving it, it's just going to happen eventually.
[197:13.78]Just only live in a sunny area.
[197:16.58]They got lightning here, man.
[197:23.69]Man, the Underground Society series is so great.
[197:27.49]Miike's film is just blazing.
[197:29.89]Kitamura is so badass.
[197:35.00]I love my favorite.
[197:35.92]Oh, monkaW, there's lightning?
[197:37.82]There's so many other things that are more likely.
[197:42.86]Yeah, but those increase exponentially if you live for thousands of years.
[197:48.12]One of these days, man, he'll totally bring back Kitamura's Underground series.
[197:57.36]Statistically speaking, carrying a bunch of Oreos in my hand up to my bedroom and falling down the stairs exponentially increases when that happens 50,000 times.
[198:07.53]Eventually.
[198:16.31]I wonder what would get me, though.
[198:17.17]You know what I mean?
[198:17.65]What would it be?
[198:18.09]If, like, if I was guaranteed, like, immortal, like, I don't die.
[198:22.39]Like, I'm just, I just live for 100,000 years.
[198:26.21]I wonder what would actually be the thing to get me.
[198:33.60]I think I'd get attacked by a bird.
[198:35.14]I really think, I think a bird would, like, swoop down and fucking take my head off.
[198:39.06]Like, an eagle would just decapitate me or something.
[198:40.82]Like, I would get attacked by an eagle and die.
[198:42.72]I think that's really what it would be.
[198:46.64]After, like, year, like, 400 and, like, like, 400,000, like an eagle, I'm gonna be in the wrong place somewhere and I'm gonna get attacked by a fucking eagle.
[198:53.55]It's gonna rip my eyes out.
[198:57.69]Alright, we're gonna close.
[198:58.77]I wanna see.
[199:10.38]Where's that mountain?
[199:11.00]There it is.
[199:11.32]Death Mountain.
[199:12.76]Ooh, I like it.
[199:19.53]Do we have any other pants?
[199:28.00]I want to change my pants.
[199:28.96]That's my angry goose.
[199:32.94]No, jacket off.
[199:38.28]Yeah, we'll wear this for a little while.
[199:59.03]Like his brain.
[200:00.17]Row.
[200:00.39]Go for 25.
[200:02.15]I'm not going for 25.
[200:03.95]No, I wouldn't want to be immortal, though.
[200:36.97]Okay, um... How much?
[200:39.09]Let's keep going.
[200:44.77]I need, like, at least 3,000 or 4,000 Wesson, right?
[200:51.14]Just check the weather wherever you go and you'll be fine.
[200:55.26]You can't check the weather for eagles.
[200:57.84]Swooping down.
[200:58.50]With a vicious look in their eye.
[201:01.93]There's no forecast for that.
[201:09.55]Alright, we're going to, uh, Neo-Brazil.
[201:11.75]It's a new zone.
[201:14.48]Oh, let me turn in these, uh... I have a couple of cards.
[201:19.28]Don't I have a... scorpion too?
[201:22.60]Do I have a scorpion?
[201:23.32]Maybe.
[201:23.50]Do I?
[201:32.59]Nope.
[201:35.32]Come to Brazil.
[201:36.14]He's going to Brazil.
[201:37.26]Finally!
[201:37.78]What the fuck?
[201:54.38]Yes, there is a Czech Eagle schedule.
[201:55.90]Just see where they play.
[202:08.48]Okay, good.
[202:11.24]Ooh, vinyl kloobs.
[202:12.84]I don't know what that is.
[202:18.32]What if you were immortal and got caught in an avalanche or a landslide and got stuck?
[202:22.27]I would die.
[202:22.69]Well, because I assume I still have to eat food.
[202:26.53]I still have to eat.
[202:27.13]It seems like we're changing the rules here a few times over.
[202:39.67]You're immortal.
[202:41.11]Do I have to eat?
[202:41.81]There's a very specific bunch of rules here that we need to get clear.
[202:49.62]Do I have to eat?
[202:52.10]I don't have to eat food.
[202:59.44]No.
[203:00.42]Only for pleasure.
[203:01.34]Okay.
[203:03.70]Okay.
[203:12.83]You will never have to use the bathroom again.
[203:16.53]You see, I don't know if I buy this though.
[203:24.10]Of course you would have to use the bathroom.
[203:25.80]Where would anything go?
[203:27.16]Do you just disappear as a black hole in my stomach?
[203:33.31]Do I have organs?
[203:35.93]So I don't have organs then.
[203:37.45]I'm just like skin filled with air, like cosmic air.
[203:53.50]You have a skin and a brain.
[203:54.66]I'm a jellyfish.
[203:56.88]Okay, Neo Brazil.
[204:07.22]Alright, how much money?
[204:07.98]Fine, designated match.
[204:08.98]We need to do three.
[204:09.86]Let's go right here.
[204:23.16]Where is it?
[204:23.60]Right here.
[204:26.70]What if you had to poop?
[204:37.94]Whatever.
[204:38.34]That one's weird.
[204:38.98]Because that one doesn't make any sense.
[204:40.66]You're just trying to get me to say a gross thing on stream.
[204:42.52]And it was really close.
[204:43.38]You almost had it.
[204:44.20]Start the game.
[204:48.21]Spin death, bro.
[204:56.55]Alright, let's kill that guy.
[205:01.48]I'm gonna try to get a 100 hit combo.
[205:08.70]It's gonna be hard with that other guy over there though.
[205:13.88]One kill.
[205:14.48]Ooh, that's good.
[205:16.98]77 hit.
[205:18.62]80 hit.
[205:31.13]Ooh, 88.
[205:31.65]93.
[205:31.67]95.
[205:31.73]Give me 100.
[205:31.97]Yeah!
[205:32.15]120.
[205:32.17]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[206:00.97]Oh, I lost it.
[206:02.27]Try to build a combo on these guys.
[206:07.43]They have a shield.
[206:08.27]I just took one damage already.
[206:13.07]Fuck you.
[206:13.51]I hate you.
[206:14.91]Stupidest enemy.
[206:16.71]This enemy sucks.
[206:20.08]Just fuck up the flow.
[206:35.66]I just want to correct the record.
[206:36.50]Jellyfish don't have brains.
[206:38.56]They have what's known as a nerve net.
[206:40.18]I like you, but don't want you spreading dangerous misinformation on your platform.
[206:46.03]Time that guy up for an hour.
[206:46.95]I'm kidding.
[206:50.99]I'm kidding.
[206:51.97]Ten seconds.
[207:08.77]Yeah, and that's like saying we don't have... A brain is not a brain.
[207:11.47]It's just electromagnetic pudding.
[207:14.49]Chunky pudding.
[207:16.96]See?
[207:17.24]I can say smart things too.
[207:28.36]Is this... What is this?
[207:32.51]Oh, free wave defense mission.
[207:33.85]I'll do it.
[207:39.86]There's so many weird animals on this planet.
[207:41.52]So many weird organisms.
[207:42.54]Wave 1.
[207:47.84]Nice.
[207:48.12]Give it to me.
[207:48.96]Yeah!
[207:49.24]I thought it was better.
[208:11.24]Stay in the same wave.
[208:12.32]Come on, wave two.
[208:15.53]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[208:16.51]Give it to me.
[208:28.90]Try not to take a hit.
[208:32.52]That'll hit two.
[208:45.08]Ooh, full armor.
[208:46.02]Let's go.
[208:46.56]No!
[208:47.02]What did I do that for?
[208:48.14]Fuck.
[208:48.90]That was stupid.
[208:50.57]I should have... I'm so mad right now.
[208:52.99]I could have just ended it immediately.
[208:56.71]Oof.
[208:59.33]What an oof.
[209:00.11]That's just actual oof.
[209:02.11]Unbelievable.
[209:03.03]I could have ended it immediately.
[209:11.83]It was a sad...
[209:30.45]Ooh, sidestep.
[209:33.31]Everybody freeze!
[209:37.27]Ooh!
[209:38.57]Still killin' both.
[210:09.87]I got Mustang mode!
[210:12.91]Holy shit!
[210:13.77]Alright, that's F. Absolute S+.
[210:15.91]Go ahead and see what's happening on the screen.
[210:23.52]That's how you know it was good.
[210:29.54]Yeah.
[210:44.05]that was really cool very fun how much do I need okay I have 40 000 coins to enter I think I have like 30.
[211:17.15]Game's a little loud.
[211:17.83]Yeah, I'll turn it down.
[211:27.43]Alright, again.
[211:33.36]Land, please.
[211:35.72]Oh, bad.
[211:36.46]It's okay.
[211:42.33]Behind, really?
[211:43.07]Get out of here.
[211:56.59]That was a perfect dodge.
[211:57.49]I felt like that was a perfect dodge.
[211:58.51]I think I got hit from the other guy.
[212:18.85]Let's give this a try.
[212:21.39]I just kicked him in the air.
[212:32.91]Hit em both!
[212:33.59]Get em both!
[212:34.05]Get em both!
[212:34.51]Get em both!
[212:34.97]Get em both!
[212:35.43]Get em both!
[212:36.07]Kill em!
[212:43.38]Oh shit, watch the health.
[212:54.62]He's invisible, right?
[212:55.68]Okay.
[212:55.98]Wait till he comes out.
[212:57.06]Perfect.
[212:57.30]Dodge it.
[212:58.26]And... Come out of there.
[213:03.93]I'm wasting time here.
[213:04.83]And...
[213:26.88]SS streak is over.
[213:27.86]Well, it might actually be an S. Ah, it's okay.
[213:47.07]Hmm?
[213:48.37]Alright, this is the third time this guy's called.
[213:50.19]I'm very curious now.
[214:07.24]My reason.
[214:07.74]You need my reason, right?
[214:11.20]Hell no, we've gotten so close.
[214:13.64]Have you thought of a reason?
[214:17.07]Yeah.
[214:18.75]It's a hassle.
[214:25.55]Just thinking about him makes me nauseous.
[214:30.55]I want him to disappear.
[214:31.65]I feel like I can't breathe.
[214:35.49]Like I have something stuck in my throat.
[214:37.57]I feel like I'm gonna die.
[214:44.67]All just too much to deal with.
[214:47.97]So, am I trying to get somebody to kill Fu?
[214:51.59]I think that's what's happening.
[214:59.18]I see.
[215:02.17]How self-centered.
[215:06.57]I've heard your reason.
[215:08.63]I'll accept your request.
[215:10.89]Out of consideration for the utterly pitiful weakness of your heart.
[215:16.70]I don't care why you do it.
[215:17.84]I just want it done.
[215:19.48]In that case, we'll enter into a formal agreement next time.
[215:25.74]An actual physical contract is not necessary, however.
[215:30.02]Shit, we have to do this again?
[215:31.00]Whatever, fine.
[215:35.12]Next time it is.
[215:38.46]What if it is Fu?
[215:40.30]Uh-oh.
[215:43.66]Calling the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[215:45.12]Alright, I want to do a couple of jobs.
[216:03.10]I did that match job, but I want to do another job.
[216:06.22]Do not call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[216:16.17]I really want to make that video.
[216:20.25]I would love to.
[216:20.87]God's sake, don't.
[216:27.75]I kind of need to, though.
[216:29.65]I have to.
[216:37.65]I almost need to do it out of... Okay.
[216:41.99]Does that video have more video views than any of the main channel videos I've ever made?
[216:48.89]If I do it the same way, I do it exactly like the videos act, it's not a joke.
[216:54.24]I don't make it a funny joke.
[216:56.28]It's just I make one of those videos and try as hard as I can to do that.
[217:00.98]No, yeah, no swearing.
[217:02.50]Just like, oh my god, guys!
[217:05.20]What the heck is happening?
[217:07.14]Don't call him!
[217:08.56]It's, like, I would just put on, like, the thing and just see if I can do it.
[217:13.77]Holy sh- I can't say holy shit, right?
[217:17.55]Head off to conquer the space monster.
[217:20.75]Yeah!
[217:27.30]Like, holy crap, guys.
[217:29.30]Oh my god, guys.
[217:30.90]Oh my goodness.
[217:33.48]What the heck?
[217:35.83]Yeah, I could pull it off.
[217:38.77]You know how to fight this guy?
[217:50.98]Round two.
[217:57.05]Round 2 it is.
[217:57.65]Got it.
[218:06.47]Gonna break that ice.
[218:35.13]Watch the rockets!
[218:36.73]Ice coming in.
[218:37.83]Cannon!
[218:59.78]Wow.
[218:59.94]Peace?
[219:00.32]Yeah.
[219:03.14]Hit him with the core.
[219:11.32]Hit him with the core.
[219:17.19]Come on, his mouth is open.
[219:24.99]Hit it.
[219:28.30]Four coming up, right?
[219:29.68]Oh shit.
[219:37.67]Death is part of life.
[219:41.73]Not if you're immortal.
[219:42.61]Alright, let's see if I can get him right here.
[219:52.84]And line up the cannon.
[219:58.69]Alright, got it.
[220:05.04]Nice.
[220:09.34]I haven't been called a fuckhead.
[220:21.87]I just got here.
[220:24.15]That's just what he does.
[220:26.63]Eh?
[220:27.65]Ooh!
[220:27.97]Ooh!
[220:30.99]Alright.
[220:31.37]Okay.
[220:46.38]Go for... There's a couple of other things in the map.
[220:50.08]Yeah.
[220:50.66]I'm not going to do this one yet.
[220:52.07]Actually, I probably can just get out of the way.
[220:53.29]Yeah.
[220:54.23]This is the main one.
[220:56.25]I'll get this out of the way.
[220:58.32]And then we're going to go do some jobs around the city.
[221:12.00]something that I've noticed let's get deadly I I feel like I'm like halfway through the game right does it feel it feels like that um I only are there any other beam katanas when do I get another katana I'm looking at chat I'm not playing the video game there's only one really
[221:41.49]You know, I haven't really noticed it being a problem or anything.
[221:46.09]It's just like, oh, right, where's my other katanas?
[221:50.11]So, eh, it's fine.
[221:53.21]Alright, time to play the game.
[221:54.95]I've literally just been looking to my left.
[222:08.96]Not a big deal, but it's a weird change to make.
[222:11.44]Yep.
[222:12.10]Batteries almost done.
[222:14.12]I just double dodged but I can't hit him.
[222:17.72]Fuck.
[222:17.96]Really?
[222:42.00]Shit.
[222:42.60]Watch out for those stupid parasite things.
[222:48.06]Goodbye.
[223:16.04]Watch out for those parasite things.
[223:17.22]Oooh, alright.
[223:31.59]Throw him back into that.
[223:37.85]He's dead.
[223:38.91]Oops, all fuckberries.
[223:48.89]My bet seems to be more in depth in three more katanas aren't needed.
[224:00.20]Yeah.
[224:02.14]I think with the chips in the glove makes it a little more interesting.
[224:09.63]Although I say that, but I've only been using the same three the whole game.
[224:11.85]I have enough money.
[224:18.88]I want to go do the jobs.
[224:19.66]There's a couple of jobs here that I want to do.
[224:35.07]There's a toilet to unclog.
[224:38.27]But what is this?
[224:43.42]A t-shirt alien.
[224:51.72]Mmm.
[224:53.38]Okay.
[224:54.78]Uniform of Don Mai Sushi.
[224:56.40]I love it.
[224:57.68]Defeat a total of 50 enemies.
[224:59.04]I've done that for sure.
[224:59.97]Yeah, I want that.
[225:09.21]Nice.
[225:10.49]I love it.
[225:13.09]Looks pretty clean.
[225:13.79]Oh, toilet.
[225:17.93]Toilet.
[225:29.98]Matches the bike, it does.
[225:38.03]End of the stream voice?
[225:39.29]What?
[225:41.31]No, I'm just relaxing, man.
[225:42.55]I'm good.
[225:44.39]Ending the stream.
[225:45.23]End of the stream voice.
[226:10.46]I just wish that that NPC just kind of glanced over and then glanced back.
[226:14.46]It'd be a nice touch.
[226:16.62]There's a race over here.
[226:32.74]This has got to be level 4 at this point.
[226:34.60]Or level 4 and 5?
[226:35.88]I wonder.
[226:36.14]Oh, let's get this out of the way.
[226:45.43]Yeah?
[226:47.29]Bike missions.
[226:48.51]Yeah, I've done this.
[226:50.31]Accept this request.
[226:52.25]Yeah, didn't I already do this?
[226:53.43]Why does it make me do the tutorial again?
[227:04.71]Is this better than 1 and 2?
[227:06.77]Yes.
[227:09.07]Absolutely without question.
[227:18.09]Holy shit, that's a sharp turn.
[227:37.61]I gotta keep in mind that that turn happens, because that sucks.
[227:57.71]He loves the game.
[227:58.51]I do.
[228:02.27]I think it's more...
[228:05.80]Well, it's definitely longer, right?
[228:11.54]I think it's, it's, I don't know.
[228:13.20]It's, it's in a weird place because they've removed the levels in the game from what it seems.
[228:20.62]They just made a bunch of open world mini games.
[228:24.69]Some of them are fights.
[228:25.41]Some of them aren't.
[228:28.01]And something about that doesn't like take away from the other games.
[228:33.40]But it makes the whole process just streamlined and you can kind of do whatever you want.
[228:37.07]So if you want to do, um, like the fighting missions and run around the open world, it's more of a focus on actually just kind of going around and looking at stuff.
[228:46.99]I do some, a little bit, I do the actual missions where you go run around and fight in corridors and stuff and it's just a wave of enemies, you keep going, there's a little cutscene, a wave of enemies, a wave of enemies, but at the end of the day, does it really matter?
[228:58.36]If you're doing the same thing, you just have to press a button that says, I'd like to do a fight mission, please.
[229:15.17]It does feel weirdly paced.
[229:16.27]Fun to play, but not very immersive for an open world.
[229:20.75]Yeah, I could see that.
[229:22.23]I still think it's better.
[229:22.99]I think it's a better game.
[229:28.71]Something about this one feels more fun than the other two.
[229:32.20]But, I don't know.
[229:32.92]There's recency bias is a problem.
[229:38.08]Because I love those little minigames in the second game.
[229:48.17]I think I like this game's... This game's feel.
[229:52.57]And this game's kind of storyline.
[229:54.51]I love the kind of superhero aspect of it.
[229:57.70]I think it's funny.
[229:58.92]Because what the hell are you supposed to do with a guy that can kill all the assassins?
[230:01.42]Oh, we just do like a Marvel universe.
[230:03.50]It's funny.
[230:12.02]I think that we're... I don't really miss the other stuff I'm talking about.
[230:16.35]This feels different enough where it's not a problem.
[230:18.85]I haven't really thought about that at all this whole time.
[230:26.28]I really need to kind of beat this before I get a D.
[230:47.98]Don't do that.
[230:51.46]Shit.
[230:55.24]He's right there.
[230:56.24]Just get him.
[230:56.72]Wouldn't you want to be immortal to be able to play all the video games?
[231:10.43]Sure.
[231:14.11]But would you though?
[231:16.67]Would you really want to?
[231:17.69]There's only a certain amount of media your brain could consume before it all really just bleeds together.
[231:30.56]10,000 years of video games?
[231:42.98]I wouldn't remember Super Mario.
[231:57.11]You would just forget about the worst ones.
[232:03.89]I would need to kind of have post-it notes around me at all times to remember all the things I thought were cool.
[232:09.95]My fridge would be just all post-it notes that I have to look at from time to time.
[232:17.01]A year. 3,200.
[232:23.15]Game system.
[232:25.82]The Omega Sony.
[232:27.60]The Sony Omega.
[232:28.46]Okay, what was it?
[232:31.84]Liked main character.
[232:33.78]His laugh was funny.
[232:35.94]And attack of the gigantic monster villain.
[232:43.60]You'd have to constantly remind yourself of what you thought was interesting.
[233:02.74]There's one.
[233:03.16]Alright, slow it down.
[233:04.70]I have to kill some of these guys.
[233:09.83]Look at the health they have.
[233:10.73]They have no health.
[233:20.06]Damn it.
[233:29.74]And I'm not even close either.
[233:30.80]Fuck you.
[233:38.84]No!
[233:39.48]Fuck!
[233:39.90]Come here!
[233:40.42]Oh god.
[233:41.54]I'm ahead of him.
[233:56.40]That turn doesn't even make any sense.
[233:58.68]Why is it even there?
[234:15.30]I don't even care if I get bronze.
[234:16.44]I just want to get these over with.
[234:17.86]Alright, we're good.
[234:30.45]If you were immortal, people would find you and experiment on you to find out why.
[234:34.73]Why would you tell anybody?
[234:35.59]I didn't even- I did- I failed it.
[234:40.87]I didn't get a medal.
[234:48.10]I'm not gonna walk up to a CIA agent and whisper in his ear and go, Hey, I'm immortal.
[234:53.66]Nothing kills me.
[234:54.28]I can't die.
[234:59.99]No, you live your whole life, and then... No, I wouldn't tell anybody.
[235:04.49]Why would anybody need to know?
[235:06.35]You would just cycle a whole new lifetime, right?
[235:19.35]You wouldn't get old.
[235:20.07]I would just constantly be making new friends.
[235:25.55]But what age are you?
[235:26.61]How old are you?
[235:29.79]How old do you look?
[235:34.67]Am I the age that I am right now?
[235:36.41]Like 30?
[235:36.57]50?
[235:36.59]20?
[235:36.63]You'd be in your prime.
[235:47.89]What, like 28, 29, 30?
[235:48.77]What?
[235:49.45]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[236:00.46]I was up all night and slept in.
[236:03.27]Gonna have to cancel.
[236:09.73]My job done laters.
[236:16.18]All this fucking punk!
[236:21.44]Oh yeah, you're probably pissed, huh?
[236:25.84]You're gonna try to kill me now, right?
[236:27.32]My boyfriend is already onto you.
[236:30.26]If you're gonna kill me, he's gonna kill you as soon as possible.
[236:32.95]Don't get in the way with this Travis fight, okay?
[236:36.45]This is serious stuff.
[236:42.53]Who's that?
[236:46.12]Was he just killing people in this restaurant?
[236:50.59]You can't kill my boyfriend.
[236:51.85]What is he doing?
[237:01.37]You just stood up and just blasted that person?
[237:03.12]The person was just enjoying like a tuna melt.
[237:06.14]What the hell was that?
[237:17.03]Travis.
[237:18.41]Gene.
[237:25.16]Do I have enough to level up?
[237:30.48]I feel like I didn't get that many Wesson.
[237:33.26]Could be wrong.
[237:40.09]I had a tuna melt for dinner last night and it was good.
[237:50.06]You guys know that once we start talking about food, the stream end countdown is about like one to two hours after that, right?
[237:58.45]I like this shirt.
[237:58.89]I'm gonna keep it on.
[238:05.05]The more you tell me how awesome and delicious the food you ate yesterday was, the more that like the internal clock has just started.
[238:17.02]I got 10,000.
[238:22.78]Alright, let's go with cooldown time reduced on this, because me and one of mine are just not going to do it.
[238:28.98]I seem to use him a lot.
[238:32.12]Cooldown time reduced again.
[238:38.51]And then the double dodge.
[238:45.19]How do I do this?
[238:47.33]Let's press B while dodging to dodge even further, so it's just B, B.
[238:54.97]No, it's AB, actually.
[238:55.89]It's boom, boom.
[238:56.45]Okay.
[238:58.01]Last attack.
[239:02.93]So this is just a normal attack?
[239:04.79]Mash Y to unleash a high-speed continuous thrust attack.
[239:14.51]Don't I already do that?
[239:18.48]Eight, nine, ten.
[239:20.98]I will go with this.
[239:24.50]I feel like I already do that move.
[239:25.54]Today is National Cheese Pizza Day, is it really?
[239:29.42]Alright, I'm going to look at this because I feel like I need to make something.
[239:37.76]I got to do something here.
[239:39.54]I've been doing the extra damage, it's cool.
[239:41.33]But I kind of want to go for something else.
[239:48.89]Okay, during slowdown after a perfect dodge.
[239:51.33]Hmm.
[239:55.53]Damage taken.
[239:56.21]I don't want the tanky ones.
[239:57.21]I don't care about the tanky ones.
[239:58.23]Tension gauge depletion.
[240:03.47]That's not bad, because that means I get to stay in the cool modes 30% longer.
[240:06.61]Another tanky one.
[240:20.08]Wait, what?
[240:21.12]After a successful perfect dodge, slow time 50% up.
[240:25.58]Does that mean the cooldown is reduced?
[240:27.65]Or does that mean I get a slowdown?
[240:30.45]Does that mean, wait, after a perfect dodge, slow time, it'll last 50% longer?
[240:36.03]Oh, shit.
[240:42.35]That's really good.
[240:44.05]Wait.
[240:45.18]So if I get three of these, that means it's 150% longer.
[240:53.03]Yeah, I'm gonna get one of these.
[240:53.81]That's awesome.
[240:54.83]That's a huge deal.
[240:59.70]Even if I just have one of them.
[241:00.48]I can get two of them?
[241:07.28]I'll come back to it.
[241:08.00]This is 39.
[241:12.10]50% more attention gauge.
[241:13.86]That's pretty good.
[241:18.62]While performing the recharge, power charge amount.
[241:20.68]So I get 50% more charge.
[241:23.86]Essentially, recharging the battery takes half as much time.
[241:27.04]But I don't think that's that big of a deal.
[241:30.40]While walking, alerts you when search object is close.
[241:35.41]I'm assuming that's... Scorpions and stuff?
[241:46.55]I think I'm going to make two of these.
[241:53.87]Yeah.
[241:57.69]I'm gonna get a full 100% longer.
[242:01.19]But I have to start doing perfect dodges, though, otherwise it's not worth it.
[242:06.73]We had pizza yesterday?
[242:07.59]Yeah, it was good.
[242:11.49]I had a barbecue, chicken, bacon, garlic, vinegar, and oat milk pizza.
[242:20.14]It's pretty good.
[242:21.84]Alright, I wanna... What's this?
[242:22.78]Well, your health is...
[242:27.92]At 80% higher.
[242:28.66]Alright, so this is just 20% more damage.
[242:37.05]I'll... Okay, we're going to get rid of two of these.
[242:43.57]So now I do 10% more damage.
[242:46.30]Or technically, like 18% less damage than I was doing before.
[242:51.28]But the slow time function is like forever.
[242:54.28]Forever.
[242:56.89]Let's try it.
[242:58.07]See if it's any good.
[243:00.01]He combined all of our sleeper agent words.
[243:08.06]Yeah.
[243:11.58]That's funny.
[243:16.05]I'm going to eat one of those things too.
[243:18.67]Why not?
[243:22.64]I'm ready to move.
[243:23.28]Let's do this boss fight.
[243:25.80]It is time.
[243:28.04]It is time.
[243:29.36]But not yet.
[243:29.90]Let's check on Shinobu.
[243:35.39]I can still fight.
[243:36.25]Shinobu, even in your nightmares, you're fighting.
[243:38.99]You're a real beast.
[243:40.61]Speaking of beasts, Hakuto's Northern Lights Bomb.
[243:44.39]That move is risky.
[243:45.35]It really tests your skill.
[243:46.33]Shinobu, are you ready to drop a Northern Lights Bomb?
[243:50.83]The Northern Lights Bomb awaits you.
[244:03.72]Alright, let's just do it.
[244:05.26]I'm ready to go.
[244:08.54]I also can go back to the time machine and fight other bosses and make them harder.
[244:10.98]I haven't done it all.
[244:16.70]I have to pee again, but I'm going to hold it until after the boss.
[244:19.52]If that makes sense to me.
[244:21.68]Or should I go right before the boss?
[244:22.80]What do you think?
[244:25.14]One's in chat if I should go before the boss.
[244:34.79]Alright.
[244:34.95]I'll be right back.
[244:38.39]This is probably the last break of the night.
[244:40.59]Probably go for like another hour, hour and a half or so.
[244:43.36]We'll see.
[244:43.62]I'll be right back.
[247:52.93]Hello.
[247:57.31]What's happening?
[248:00.65]Oh, there we go.
[248:01.91]Okay.
[248:12.14]The smile.
[248:13.22]What's with the smile?
[248:17.98]What's with the smiling?
[248:24.36]Don't worry about it.
[248:25.08]Okay.
[248:26.57]If you tell me not to worry about it, I'm not going to worry about it.
[248:28.39]Why would I worry about something I'm told just to not worry about?
[248:30.61]Okay.
[248:37.39]Let's do the boss.
[248:39.20]Here we go.
[248:51.99]The Garden of Insanity.
[248:59.37]Dark World Princess.
[249:00.45]I wonder what they're going to do.
[249:01.97]I have no idea what this game is going to throw at us now.
[249:07.35]Because...
[249:26.20]I think there's only really been two or three real boss fights the whole game.
[249:32.80]There's been maybe three you fight the boss games.
[249:38.71]The rest have just been insanity.
[249:41.17]Mini games inside of the rooms, people killing each other, somebody teaching me moves.
[249:46.49]I wonder what this is going to be.
[249:55.54]Alright, let's go with this one.
[249:57.52]Eat in.
[249:59.14]Uh, greatly increase health attack bar intention.
[250:01.08]Let's do it.
[250:02.01]I mean, why not?
[250:02.79]If you have the money, just use it.
[250:04.03]Yeah, but just musical chairs.
[250:09.05]Alright.
[250:09.31]I got five heals.
[250:09.85]I'm good.
[250:10.27]Save it.
[250:33.08]Does she fall asleep in the toilet?
[250:34.18]Let's see if she looks good.
[250:45.61]Yeah, it does.
[250:49.03]Somebody said a tuna fish, and I don't want it.
[250:51.77]I want like a nice, big, cheesy tuna melt.
[250:57.36]With just like a bunch of pickles on the side.
[251:04.11]Damn, that sounds good.
[251:06.33]That's the game plan after this.
[251:07.41]There's like a side salad, carrots and shit.
[251:15.69]Yeah.
[251:19.81]Where the hell are we?
[251:21.41]At school.
[251:22.63]A Japanese school, huh?
[251:24.29]I've seen places like this in Miike's movies about delinquents and stuff.
[251:28.94]this place is kind of scary yeah like one missed call scary scary oh god something feels off here yeah super off is this I'm probably gonna have to run away from a scary monster thing I'm a cleaner
[251:54.65]My little sister's name is Doremi Midorikawa.
[251:57.31]It's spelled like notes and pronounced Doremi.
[251:59.89]It's one of those weird names people give their kids these days.
[252:03.05]My house is near Midori Yama Studio.
[252:05.23]During my rebellious period, I wore lots of Kimidori green.
[252:09.01]I was disappointed in myself for not wearing my favorite color, red.
[252:12.56]I've been cursed by green, which is Midori in Japanese.
[252:16.46]There are so many things I hate about it, and I almost totally blamed my parents, but I just couldn't hold them accountable because I love mommy and daddy.
[252:24.46]I would run.
[252:24.82]I don't care how skilled I am.
[252:26.04]I'm gonna run.
[252:56.80]I'll just call the nuke in.
[252:58.54]You know what I mean?
[252:59.06]I'll just send a nuke.
[253:00.72]I'm gonna run.
[253:01.36]I'm gonna try to get out.
[253:07.16]Are you fucking kidding me?
[253:11.67]It's first person.
[253:15.08]They really just said, fuck it.
[253:16.92]They don't even give a shit.
[253:18.34]They just said, fuck it.
[253:19.38]We're gonna do whatever we want.
[253:20.98]Each one of these bosses has been like a weird, almost like trope-y thing.
[253:26.42]I love it, but they just said, fuck it, huh?
[253:30.50]It's now a scary game.
[253:31.48]It's gonna be a jump scare.
[253:37.88]There has to be.
[253:39.49]You don't make this without a jump scare.
[253:49.12]It kind of feels like I'm in Gary's mod right now.
[253:53.06]What does that mean?
[253:58.64]We need a face cam.
[253:59.42]I don't have a T- I don't have clothes on.
[254:03.71]Oh, God.
[254:04.41]Okay, fine.
[254:05.17]I gotta put a t-shirt on.
[254:06.15]Give me a sec.
[254:07.45]I'll be- I'll give you two seconds.
[254:40.37]Okay, I got a bathrobe.
[254:41.89]That's the closest thing I could grab.
[254:47.99]Hold on.
[254:56.64]Okay.
[255:05.14]I got a bathrobe.
[255:15.97]Alright, that looks good.
[255:17.91]Here we go.
[255:20.56]Turn off the lights?
[255:25.74]No.
[255:43.29]It's gonna turn around.
[255:43.89]It's gonna scream.
[255:51.05]No?
[255:51.29]And we're certain that Suda51 didn't have seven or eight games in development and just mushed them all together and made No More Heroes 3.
[256:05.37]Are you sure?
[256:05.73]Are we certain about that?
[256:17.09]I feel like these are all just, like, EXEs he had on his desktop.
[256:21.45]That he was just like, yeah, I'm gonna try to make, like, a little horror game.
[256:24.10]And he's got, like, fucking 40 EXEs on his desktop of, uh, games that he made.
[256:28.06]With, like, a group of friends and his teammates.
[256:31.36]And it's like, yeah, fuck it, let's just put that in No More Heroes, why not?
[256:50.00]We're good.
[256:56.61]Mustang mode!
[257:08.18]I will back to first person each series.
[257:21.03]It's a 20k robe?
[257:24.77]I think this is from Target.
[257:27.44]What happened?
[257:48.22]Blood.
[258:00.77]Okay.
[258:01.21]This is getting more and more bad and scary.
[258:06.61]It's gonna be- It's gonna come out, she's gonna be screaming, coming out, and I'm gonna turn around and run.
[258:21.80]Left or right?
[258:24.14]That doesn't open.
[258:24.66]Alright, I'm gonna say... Right is a shorter hallway, so I'm gonna go right.
[258:32.23]What's that?
[258:37.13]Return to the motel?
[258:38.27]Return to the motel?
[258:46.48]What the hell is this?
[258:51.38]It's a way out.
[258:52.12]Wait, it's the midway point in the haunted house so the little kids can leave when they're really scared?
[258:55.88]Okay.
[258:58.45]Okay.
[259:00.59]You know, like fucking Darth Vader's holding the door open for the parents to take their kids out.
[259:05.39]It's like, oh, thank you, Darth Vader.
[259:06.66]He lets you out.
[259:07.74]You don't go to the scary, awful part.
[259:11.10]Like, they wave.
[259:12.14]Like, two or three of them wave as you leave.
[259:13.86]I remember that.
[259:16.76]They try to keep you from the really scary shit.
[259:33.35]Unlocked a memory?
[259:35.25]Old joke, Andy.
[259:36.27]No, I can make... A reference is an old joke.
[259:40.29]You're referencing something that happened before.
[259:42.37]So I can reference a thing that I'm referencing because it's old and I'm referencing it.
[259:47.33]Okay.
[260:02.56]Two, two.
[260:03.06]Alright, remember these numbers up here.
[260:05.59]Salty Andy.
[260:08.03]There's a flashlight in there.
[260:10.51]That's a mirror.
[260:11.03]Never mind.
[260:15.65]I did that on purpose.
[260:16.93]Haha, that was funny.
[260:17.65]I have this blood in here.
[260:27.92]Dang.
[260:28.66]Whatever.
[260:32.50]I hope this part goes on for an hour.
[260:35.86]Watch this shirt.
[260:59.41]I feel like I just have like a lit cigarette.
[261:15.40]Just in an ashtray right here that you can see.
[261:17.62]I don't smoke it once.
[261:20.74]It's just there.
[261:22.38]Just lit.
[261:24.30]And for an hour.
[261:28.01]Do I have to clear all these rooms?
[261:29.03]Is that what's going on?
[261:29.63]Or is it just the ones with blood?
[261:42.14]Definitely all the rooms with blood.
[261:43.30]Absolutely right.
[261:43.98]Yeah, of course.
[261:50.94]I want to try the dodge.
[261:59.05]Let's try a dodge.
[262:00.11]So, let's see.
[262:05.96]Now, how long does this last?
[262:11.06]I mean, I can't even tell.
[262:13.92]I'm just killing him so hard.
[262:15.08]Remember, we can see the damaged tattoo.
[262:26.63]What if you guys just never knew, but I was just covered in tattoos from here down, from the neck down?
[262:31.64]You just saw like a bunch of patterns in there?
[262:33.38]I feel like I would not, I would have been, you probably would have known that by now.
[262:45.48]Nothing?
[262:45.70]I see green.
[263:01.17]Oh shit, no.
[263:04.03]So where do I go?
[263:04.65]Wait, what just happened?
[263:14.50]Hey!
[263:16.08]It's putting me at the end of the hallway.
[263:18.13]Oh, that's what's going on.
[263:19.27]It's putting me at the...
[263:24.88]Okay, this is just putting me at the end of the hallway when I do that.
[263:28.72]So, alright, let's fight then.
[263:30.25]Okay, I gotta clear the rooms.
[263:36.33]Put a tattoo of yourself.
[263:39.39]Hey, come on, reference Andy, come on.
[263:41.51]I already, I made the joke like three years ago that I was gonna get a tattoo of my face on my face.
[263:46.18]Full scale.
[263:49.74]Come on.
[264:07.28]I think that's it.
[264:09.59]Maybe one more room.
[264:13.97]Get a tattoo of the sus face on your face.
[264:18.29]No.
[264:32.92]What is this?
[264:34.42]Disco?
[264:34.94]Somebody started a disco?
[264:36.80]That was like a big thing.
[264:37.48]It was a disco in the chat or something.
[264:38.88]What was that?
[264:39.32]What am I supposed to do?
[264:51.66]Do I just leave?
[264:58.19]Oh, it's open.
[264:58.69]Okay, it's open.
[265:08.74]Good thing the face cam was on so you could see that.
[265:14.83]Okay, I think you got your face cam that you wanted.
[265:17.31]You're tough, Travis.
[265:19.29]So I guess you've heard about me, huh?
[265:21.16]My boyfriend knows a lot about you.
[265:22.80]He is always talking about you.
[265:24.34]That you're free-spirited and stupid and intelligent and dumb.
[265:29.89]But you're also a nice guy with a serious side, too.
[265:32.33]Is this chat talking to me?
[265:34.73]There's a certain type of guy that reminds me of my old boyfriend.
[265:38.14]Something happened and we ended up breaking up.
[265:40.68]But the reason for that was actually pretty funny.
[265:43.02]Want to hear about it?
[265:45.22]No, I'm not really in the mood.
[265:48.47]Oh, it's about time we finish settling this.
[265:51.74]Alright then, let's go up to the roof.
[265:53.96]Jump with me, okay?
[265:54.96]I kind of hope it's still first person.
[265:56.06]That seems quickest.
[265:57.62]One, two, three!
[265:58.84]Huh?
[266:04.59]Alright, so we actually gonna fight.
[266:06.35]Is that a mouth on her hand?
[266:36.42]I'm thirsty.
[266:38.17]I want some tea.
[266:39.69]Holy shit.
[266:42.09]Sleepy.
[266:43.97]Still so sleepy.
[266:46.95]Listen, this mean, scary old man is standing right there.
[266:51.24]Let's kill him together.
[266:52.66]He's pretty tough.
[266:54.90]I might even die.
[266:55.78]No!
[266:55.84]Don't die!
[266:56.50]No way!
[266:58.66]Run!
[267:05.00]That's a free fee.
[267:07.34]Really?
[267:07.80]Is this a suit fight?
[267:08.98]Is this a suit fight?
[267:10.40]We're going into space?
[267:36.56]I'm gonna have nightmares about this.
[267:39.64]I really will.
[267:40.46]Are they like Wallet Warrior laughing at me?
[267:42.88]Okay.
[267:43.14]Like nice skin.
[267:44.70]Okay.
[268:06.32]Press R to launch a Tiger attack.
[268:08.61]Press L to fire your multi-missile.
[268:12.73]Tiger attack multi-missile.
[268:15.77]This is also called full green mode.
[268:17.97]These are both extremely powerful attacks, so they'll need time to cool down after use.
[268:21.95]Watch out for the right time to unleash them.
[268:24.65]Do I have a regular attack?
[268:29.85]I have regular attacks.
[268:35.48]This is ridiculous.
[268:38.02]So when should I use this?
[268:43.08]I'm gonna use it now.
[268:46.28]I can't do it.
[268:46.66]I just tried to do it.
[268:48.05]Oh, wrong button.
[268:51.65]Get the fuck out!
[269:00.91]Get the fuck out!
[269:06.71]I just point blanked.
[269:16.89]Can I stand in the fire?
[269:17.79]Wait, you guys get to see my APM down there.
[269:23.76]How am I doing?
[269:39.69]Ow.
[269:44.42]Alright, almost phase one.
[269:53.38]Of course, we get a pew, pew, pew.
[269:55.10]Alright, phase two.
[269:56.12]Now what?
[270:02.65]Got it.
[270:06.79]Okay.
[270:14.55]I'm fine.
[270:19.07]This is pretty easy.
[270:23.44]This one's pretty easy.
[270:24.58]Let's just kill her.
[270:27.96]That was easy.
[270:36.18]That was a cool fight.
[270:36.90]Just a cool character.
[270:37.58]But, I mean, I just absolutely dunked on you.
[270:55.53]Midori.
[270:56.57]Midori.
[270:57.73]Midori.
[270:58.67]Lose.
[271:01.71]It has to be a little easier since you can't use your healing items.
[271:04.05]Oh, I guess I meant to say it makes sense.
[271:14.50]That was more of an experience than it was a fight.
[271:19.33]Is this a real boss fight?
[271:49.72]Who the hell are you?
[271:51.56]Trav, it's me.
[271:53.62]Kamui, is that you?
[271:55.95]Not this one.
[271:57.75]Stay out of this.
[271:59.03]That's my girlfriend.
[272:00.95]Seriously?
[272:02.09]This is your girlfriend?
[272:03.73]We've got no beef with you.
[272:05.67]We just sort of took Fu up on his offer and thought of it kind of like going to a nice barbecue, you know?
[272:10.80]Like that thing that's really trendy these days.
[272:12.96]Dompering, or whatever.
[272:15.04]That was basically what we envisioned coming here.
[272:17.70]Are you for real?
[272:19.97]I've never actually met Fu.
[272:21.87]During the breakout, I made eye contact with him for like a second, and I could feel the dark world in those eyes.
[272:29.06]Oh yeah, by the way, I'm a dark world princess.
[272:32.72]And that's right, Midori is an actual princess.
[272:35.92]Isn't that awesome?
[272:37.76]Okay, so I kind of got no idea what's going on.
[272:42.20]Travis strikes again.
[272:43.14]Skipper left in the dark.
[272:44.58]Omega lull.
[272:48.14]Thanks, Trav.
[272:49.84]How can I return the favor?
[272:51.26]Come on over and hang out sometime.
[272:53.50]That's good enough for me.
[272:55.08]Trav, you really are a good guy.
[272:58.55]I've been too good of a guy, really.
[273:04.93]So then, what do you all think about this?
[273:08.71]This boss fight?
[273:11.12]It had become quite the confusing mess, but somewhere inside that confusing mess hid the truth.
[273:18.91]What is real?
[273:20.37]What is not?
[273:21.73]We were just talking about this.
[273:22.55]These are indeed questions for the ages.
[273:25.25]There is only one thing that is real.
[273:28.79]I am here in front of your very eyes.
[273:32.13]After crossing the river of life and death, find the place where the point and the line of everyday life intersect.
[273:43.03]Is this the streamer?
[273:44.01]Kill the boy.
[273:44.81]And let the man be born.
[273:47.01]And then have everyone forget.
[273:48.31]Because it was so awful.
[273:49.49]That no one even remembers this entire series, John.
[274:12.83]Kill the fast.
[274:13.73]Yeah, that was okay.
[274:19.10]That was weird.
[274:25.14]Kill the boy.
[274:26.90]Kill the boy.
[274:34.03]I feel like I'm at a Suda51 convention and I don't even know I'm there.
[274:39.77]It's like, he's just referencing every game he's ever made.
[275:01.15]Okay, we're now number four.
[275:03.99]We're number five now.
[275:05.07]We're going for number four.
[275:05.93]Let's go for the next one.
[275:14.51]We'll do another one.
[275:25.86]Yeah, I feel like going for the... Being number four means that we have three more to do.
[275:32.50]Hmm.
[275:33.32]That's probably not enough for a whole stream, though.
[275:37.86]So... Okay, so I'm going to play WarioWare on Friday.
[275:43.92]We're not done.
[275:44.34]I'm still here.
[275:44.90]I'm going to stream for like another hour.
[275:49.30]WarioWare is going to be Friday.
[275:52.00]And then Wario... I might even play... I'll play this on Saturday.
[275:56.68]Depending on how long this takes to finish it.
[276:02.31]Because I feel like there's probably still another four and a half, maybe four to five hours left in the game.
[276:12.85]There's also the time machine to do the bosses on higher difficulties.
[276:15.28]That's true, yeah.
[276:16.22]There's still plenty of content to do for a whole stream.
[276:21.86]So we'll go for one more.
[276:23.76]And then I'll finish this up on Saturday.
[276:26.42]And then we'll do WarioWare on Friday.
[276:27.82]We'll do one more.
[276:35.72]Get us towards heading to the top three.
[276:37.86]And then it's tuna melt time.
[276:53.65]What if you get struck by lightning before then?
[276:56.89]I've already lived like 200 lifetimes.
[277:00.05]So, I don't care.
[277:03.04]Mr. Sonic Juice has arrived.
[277:05.61]I see.
[277:07.35]Alright, I'll see him.
[277:09.15]Okay.
[277:10.29]Damon, you come with me.
[277:12.01]Me?
[277:13.25]Why?
[277:14.39]Just fucking come!
[277:21.58]Foo.
[277:22.86]Everyone so far has died.
[277:26.06]What's a Big Hero 6 guy?
[277:26.94]What's his name?
[277:27.52]Amex.
[277:49.08]So what if a little kid drew Baymax?
[277:54.21]Because Baymax is their favorite character.
[277:56.09]And then they just put it to a 3D renderer.
[278:04.28]By the way, I love this character's design.
[278:05.68]I think it's amazing.
[278:06.82]There was not a dog at the design.
[278:07.86]It's just kind of an observation.
[278:20.34]Who are these two?
[278:24.28]Ah, the big four have gathered.
[278:27.54]Or to put it a different way, only the big four survived.
[278:31.34]WWE 2K20.
[278:31.92]I'll wait patiently.
[278:34.18]Could this human even make it all the way to me?
[278:37.24]It's fucking crazy.
[278:38.14]I'm not worried.
[278:39.30]Sniping Lee here will put this Earthling down.
[278:42.69]That's what everyone says before they get killed.
[278:45.66]You're probably gonna die too.
[278:48.00]Prince Foo, can I kill this guy?
[278:51.30]Take him out with a headshot.
[278:53.68]Xavier Renegade Angel.
[278:54.84]Yeah, it is.
[278:57.10]Those are some pretty big words there, huh?
[279:00.43]It's the truth, Foo.
[279:01.63]I just want that guy killed.
[279:03.33]I want to see him torn to shreds.
[279:06.73]Jump Force, create a character.
[279:08.53]Soul Calibur, create a character.
[279:10.51]It's for me!
[279:12.01]Keep your opinions to yourself.
[279:14.23]Fine.
[279:15.32]I'll kill him my own way.
[279:17.18]Don't you fucking get in mine.
[279:19.54]Hurry up and take this guy out so I don't get in your way, big fool.
[279:22.50]It's so funny how intentional that is, though.
[279:24.74]Can I kill this guy, please?
[279:27.13]I really hate this Earthling.
[279:28.93]It's so charming.
[279:29.83]I love it.
[279:30.55]This is stupid.
[279:31.65]I'm going to take a nap and wait.
[279:33.97]Don't get killed in your sleep.
[279:36.43]I'll take your head first.
[279:46.83]These guys don't look very powerful at all.
[279:48.83]That's number two, number three and number one there.
[279:55.33]It's so funny.
[280:19.21]I look like such jobbers.
[280:20.45]I remember the E3 trailer being like, holy shit, look at those guys.
[280:25.03]They look crazy.
[280:26.73]When there's no lighting effects and they're just standing around.
[280:30.67]Yeah, it's like, yeah, you kind of do look like a bootleg action figure.
[280:36.96]I'm Bishop.
[280:38.22]I'm kind of stuck with this asshole.
[280:40.28]Nice to meet you too.
[280:41.76]Hey, didn't you guys meet in TSA?
[280:44.93]Well, it's my first appearance in the numbered series, and I'm the main character of a different game, so I'm fine with the first encounter thing.
[280:53.52]You're so humble, Kamui.
[280:55.62]Oh shit, this scene is awesome!
[280:57.78]Really?
[280:58.66]These guys are kinda creepy.
[281:00.74]Man, Kukihara is so cool!
[281:03.74]For reals, Kakehara is the shit.
[281:06.94]Asano is kicking ass too.
[281:09.24]He's totally losing his shit.
[281:11.56]Actually, I don't really care for Japanese movies.
[281:15.84]Even though you're Japanese?
[281:18.50]Yeah, but still, I just don't like them much.
[281:21.42]I guess I kind of like the serialized dramas a bit more.
[281:25.08]Okay, then.
[281:26.02]How about the Girls X Heroines series?
[281:29.36]What's that?
[281:31.04]I recommend Majima Joke.
[281:33.41]Can't go wrong with Majima Joe.
[281:35.51]It even beats Bizarre Jelly.
[281:37.76]No, I mean like Aibo, Tokyo Detective Duo and stuff.
[281:42.02]Aibo?
[281:43.32]You mean the Aibo where Miike guest starred in Season 10, Episode 16?
[281:47.30]You've got good taste.
[281:49.78]I only have Season 10, Episode 16.
[281:52.79]But let's watch it together, you guys.
[281:55.23]Want something to drink?
[281:56.93]Okay, I'll take a mango cola.
[282:00.13]Nice.
[282:00.93]I'll have one too.
[282:08.53]Man, oh I got a t-shirt Nice Nice, let's get this out on a tray Let's get this out onto a tray Why did you say that?
[282:26.66]What the fuck?
[282:28.74]Did you say that now?
[282:30.34]I'm gonna only think about that for the next two hours.
[282:32.22]Oh
[282:43.37]I can't.
[282:48.78]Yeah, I've probably seen every single one of his videos up until like a year or two ago.
[282:55.33]I've seen almost every single one.
[282:58.13]I used to listen to those videos before I would just put them on on repeat.
[283:04.01]Just go straight through them all while I was about to go to sleep.
[283:13.82]He always loves the cigarettes, right?
[283:15.08]So he's like, oh man, there's cigarettes in here.
[283:17.54]These old cigarettes.
[283:18.54]And I'd be like, oh, what kind of cigarettes?
[283:26.98]I actually like that.
[283:30.02]On instant coffee, yeah, the coffee too.
[283:31.88]It's like, is the coffee good?
[283:32.86]Can you still drink it?
[283:45.77]I want the Devolver burger.
[283:51.08]It's just my favorite color.
[283:53.22]Sorry, if you have a shirt that has my favorite color in the world, I'm gonna wear it.
[284:01.94]Gene?
[284:02.58]I'm hungry.
[284:11.96]You see him eat the Civil War hardtack.
[284:13.75]It was wild.
[284:14.83]I don't think so.
[284:15.61]I don't remember.
[284:32.12]Jermacolor is mint toothpaste.
[284:37.42]Yeah, just really too bad that they don't have the aquafresh orange shower clean.
[284:43.70]Shower for your mouth toothpaste anymore.
[284:45.69]I can't find it.
[284:46.19]I don't know where it is.
[284:48.43]It sucks.
[284:54.77]That's a lot of subs.
[284:55.67]Mystic Mushroom.
[284:56.45]Thanks for the 20 community subs.
[285:00.23]20 community subs.
[285:00.79]Appreciate it.
[285:08.89]20 subs.
[285:10.07]And I have enough to do this.
[285:12.07]Yep.
[285:12.23]I haven't heard that reference in a while.
[285:16.21]I think about that toothpaste all the time.
[285:20.08]It was white and orange.
[285:22.44]An orange stripe.
[285:24.16]And it had this flavor.
[285:25.78]It was almost like a minty citrus kind of flavor.
[285:28.86]And it just foamed up and made these insane, awesome, like minty, tingly foam bubbles in your mouth.
[285:36.99]Why would they ever get rid of that?
[285:37.92]It was awesome.
[285:45.94]No, it wasn't like candy flavored.
[285:47.60]It was mint.
[285:48.42]But it was just a small hint.
[285:52.26]Tiny hint of this kind of orange flavor.
[285:56.57]It was too good for the plebs.
[285:58.21]Oh, that's sad.
[286:03.17]You didn't say community subs in the goofy voice.
[286:04.85]Oh, sorry.
[286:05.27]I got community subs.
[286:12.01]Master, I'll kill him.
[286:12.73]Please let me kill him.
[286:14.25]Still fighting in your dreams.
[286:15.77]If you're going to kill someone, you've got to go full on.
[286:18.78]Tag team version of the infamously STO move.
[286:21.62]Back when New Japan was at its peak, Hashimoto and Ogawa simply owned it.
[286:27.04]The one tag team surpassing the fabulous Freebirds has got to be Hashimoto and Ogawa.
[286:32.88]Has to be.
[286:33.28]Alright, let's go.
[286:39.37]I think I'm going to unlock the last area of the game right now.
[286:45.45]That's how Neelix would say.
[286:46.81]Everyone used to hate me for doing that.
[287:04.24]When I first did the Neelix impression, everyone screamed at me.
[287:07.43]And now you all want me to do it.
[287:11.07]Now it's what I hear.
[287:12.11]Do the Neelix impression.
[287:13.67]Even though when I did the Neelix impression, like, two years ago, like, 3,000 people left the stream.
[287:20.08]And I was told, I'm going to unfollow the channel if you do that again.
[287:29.38]Lenny the person, thanks for the 10.
[287:30.40]Get me out of here, sub.
[287:36.36]Go to Call of Battle?
[287:37.44]Where is that?
[287:43.85]Didn't I get some new cards?
[287:44.71]I think I did.
[287:46.47]Pretty sure I got a couple of cards.
[287:51.69]Aquafresh Extreme Clean Whitening Toothpaste.
[287:53.58]It exists, but is it orange?
[287:56.02]And do you have to buy it on Amazon or eBay?
[288:17.27]Didn't get any?
[288:20.95]Secondhand toothpaste.
[288:25.83]Say errand.
[288:30.08]You guys hate something until I do it enough times and then you want me to do it.
[288:34.12]How about this?
[288:34.76]I will trade you one errand.
[288:36.02]How's that?
[288:55.42]I only picked up two scorpions the whole game.
[289:12.89]Call a battle.
[289:19.73]Go.
[289:22.77]So easy!
[289:35.22]Do the sunflower joke?
[289:36.70]Oh, I have to go back here.
[289:37.60]Alright.
[289:39.94]Let's not spend very much time here.
[289:43.28]Let me get the missions done.
[289:44.18]Oh, yeah.
[289:59.14]C is for cookie, that's good enough for me.
[290:03.00]C is for cookie, that's good enough for me.
[290:06.85]C is for cookie, and that's good enough for me.
[290:11.45]I figured I would try a new one.
[290:20.93]I figured I would try a new one today.
[290:22.95]I figured I would try a new one today.
[290:26.89]Ow.
[290:30.11]What the fuck?
[290:32.27]Do it!
[290:36.02]That does last so much longer.
[290:40.86]Hey, can you untry that please?
[290:49.25]Oh my fucking goodness.
[291:05.53]Oh, I got you with another one, didn't I?
[291:09.01]I don't know where I am.
[291:17.42]DO IT!
[291:20.72]Oh my fucking god, this camera's just stuck in the goddamn wall.
[291:44.96]Whoa!
[291:46.40]Is he blocking it?
[291:54.66]Oh fuck yeah, good night.
[292:19.34]Really, this fucking motherfucker just ruined everything.
[292:21.78]Are you kidding me?
[292:23.14]I'm in the middle of Mustang mode and this guy hits me from behind?
[292:25.66]Are you shitting me?
[292:27.76]Why are you still alive?
[292:33.09]Why are you still alive?
[292:34.43]Why?
[292:34.99]Full green mode standing by?
[292:39.89]Oh, nice.
[292:47.77]Let's go.
[293:00.92]Why is it off?
[293:02.70]Alright, this has been really confusing.
[293:20.36]Okay.
[293:21.92]What system is this on?
[293:28.56]This is on the Nintendo Switch.
[293:35.20]C, whatever, just skip it.
[293:43.01]I'm still wearing this bathrobe and it's so uncomfortable.
[293:51.25]Nintendo Switch.
[293:56.30]Daniel Bryan just walked out at AEW.
[294:02.46]What?
[294:02.66]Are you serious?
[294:03.76]Are you fucking with me?
[294:14.27]Are you kidding though?
[294:14.91]Is that really happening?
[294:15.83]Holy shit.
[294:29.70]Do you stream naked because it's a fetish?
[294:32.41]I stream naked because it's hot in Nevada.
[294:36.05]I'm not naked.
[294:36.69]I just have a shirt on.
[295:02.67]Dodge!
[295:32.88]There it is, 100.
[295:36.76]Knock him out.
[295:37.22]Let me get a 200-hit combo right now.
[295:42.96]Grab him!
[295:44.00]Grab him!
[295:45.68]You motherfucker.
[295:47.66]I'm actually infuriated over this one.
[295:52.78]Fuck!
[295:54.88]Fuck!
[296:14.15]150 at least.
[296:19.37]Where am I?
[296:22.21]God damn it.
[296:23.13]This fucking camera.
[296:26.41]Let me get to 200.
[296:27.77]Come on.
[296:37.24]Don't kill him.
[296:45.66]200!
[296:45.68]Let me see it!
[296:49.10]There it is.
[296:49.46]Sorry, I got too early to combo.
[296:50.62]I'm fine.
[296:53.51]I'm happy.
[297:00.13]I get stuck in between the cars and the trucks.
[297:04.46]I love the idea of having to reload the sword from a design perspective.
[297:15.85]You know, it was actually a lot harder in the other games.
[297:19.33]It took a lot longer, and you had to stay still.
[297:22.64]During some boss fights, it was hell.
[297:25.54]You'd have to just sit there, standing still, just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[297:29.74]It's kind of like doing a whetstone in Monster Hunter.
[297:35.83]It took a little longer.
[297:50.63]Will you ever stop streaming?
[297:52.99]You mean permanently?
[297:54.61]Eventually?
[297:56.33]Yeah.
[297:57.27]Probably one day.
[297:57.83]I mean, tonight?
[298:01.29]I mean, not right now.
[298:02.49]Maybe in a little bit.
[298:05.11]I mean, we all permanently are going to stop doing stuff.
[298:07.34]Permanently at one point.
[298:09.20]Change what you're doing.
[298:09.98]Do something new?
[298:13.50]I don't know.
[298:19.16]I don't have any plans on when that will be.
[298:21.55]I just know that eventually maybe it will happen.
[298:25.57]No, I'm a human.
[298:27.35]I kind of want to do the tank, the alligator thing again.
[298:37.43]I'm going to do this and then go see if I have another mission for the alligator.
[298:40.67]That looked like it was kind of fun.
[298:54.90]What will you give the channel to?
[298:56.92]Let's go.
[298:57.54]I have like a son or a daughter.
[299:03.58]Girma985 continues.
[299:04.82]Through Greg Elbertson.
[299:08.56]Strawberry.
[299:09.42]Right on.
[299:09.80]Screwcrusher.
[299:10.54]Dead kick.
[299:11.54]Spin death row.
[299:21.15]That was a little explodey thing, really.
[299:22.27]Yes.
[299:23.27]Ooh, utopia coins!
[299:24.69]We get another 100 hit combo.
[299:35.42]I'll take it.
[299:55.50]I don't think so.
[299:56.22]I don't think I want to do that.
[299:57.82]That would be... Invincible.
[300:11.22]I just kicked him out of the thing I wanted to keep him in.
[300:13.96]Am I still invincible?
[300:20.54]Nope!
[300:21.06]No!
[300:23.63]I thought I was still invincible.
[300:25.65]Oh, that's annoying.
[300:26.70]Got 1.5x attack power.
[300:34.20]No, it's just going to exist.
[300:53.38]Nobody has to own it.
[300:54.74]It's going to exist though, right?
[301:15.44]They're out of my way.
[301:20.58]They already have us again?
[301:23.10]What is he hitting me with?
[301:29.58]I need healing out of them.
[301:36.07]Here we go.
[301:37.45]Hold green, standing by.
[301:46.61]What's happening?
[301:50.22]What's going on?
[301:53.83]What?
[301:54.03]That scream is like frozen.
[302:07.52]I'll give you $10 for the channel.
[302:10.79]Did you know this channel's worth $2 to $5 billion, or like $100 billion, when we looked at it last time?
[302:21.47]I bet you, I bet you, if I, what's this channel worth, I think?
[302:24.73]What's my collective online internet channels worth, collectively?
[302:36.86]Like, if a company were to wake up tomorrow morning with all of my logins and it's just theirs.
[302:41.36]I'm gonna say a clean 20 million.
[302:53.77]Not even close, probably.
[303:00.03]20 million. 10?
[303:08.04]You think that's more than a million?
[303:09.25]What do you think?
[303:09.71]My channel.
[303:09.97]8 million?
[303:10.15]6 million?
[303:10.35]750,000?
[303:10.49]Million?
[303:10.69]Okay.
[303:10.99]Okay.
[303:35.23]3 million?
[303:36.06]2 million?
[303:37.74]You're slowly coming down.
[303:39.98]You're collectively slowly coming down.
[303:41.28]It started at like 10, 20 million, and now it's like you guys are being like, actually, no, not even close.
[303:47.94]It keeps going like 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[303:49.96]This is the auction, no.
[304:00.75]I know what this channel's worth.
[304:03.01]Priceless.
[304:03.87]How's that sound?
[304:06.35]I'd like to get down there, though, so I could, like, actually do the mission.
[304:10.67]Shit's priceless to me.
[304:19.31]Ten million or go fuck yourself.
[304:20.27]That's where I stand.
[304:33.99]Hmm.
[304:39.73]$20 gift card.
[304:48.77]It's not worth anything without you.
[304:52.64]Oh, man.
[304:53.20]That was, like, actually... I mean, we're all just fucking around.
[304:56.38]I'm just messing around here, but... Damn, that, like... I felt that one.
[305:04.07]I did...
[305:17.17]He's getting a big head.
[305:18.07]Now, anytime I feel like I'm getting a big head, I just, like, pull the, I just open up the little thing in the back of my neck, and it lets some air out.
[305:31.20]You gotta let the air out every now and then, you do.
[305:48.32]Nice dad joke?
[305:49.20]Thanks.
[305:50.94]Alright, somebody said this was actually hard.
[305:52.70]So, we'll see how hard.
[306:05.27]Okay, here we go.
[306:06.23]Alligator attack.
[306:06.97]This one's the hard one.
[306:13.25]Yes!
[306:14.09]Hit!
[306:14.25]Next!
[306:17.25]Hit!
[306:18.25]Two full minutes.

[306:38.90]Hit!
[306:40.06]Bingo!
[306:41.22]Yes!
[306:42.30]Hit!
[306:45.58]Bingo!
[306:46.61]Yes!
[306:49.18]Focus on this guy first before the red guy.
[306:51.28]I don't know how close he needs to get to kill me.
[306:57.92]Mm-hmm.
[307:19.50]Hit!
[307:20.38]Next!
[307:21.54]Yes!
[307:22.52]Ringo!
[307:23.66]Yes!
[307:24.38]I wouldn't say this one was particularly harder than the last one.
[307:26.54]Ringo!
[307:29.35]Next!
[307:30.35]Hit!
[307:31.45]Ringo!
[307:32.59]Yes!
[307:33.53]Next!

[307:46.13]Next!
[307:47.31]Yes!
[307:51.19]Oh, shit.
[307:53.11]Oh, shit.
[307:54.62]Oh, shit.
[308:02.08]Um, three seconds.
[308:08.21]Nice.
[308:09.69]That was close.
[308:12.83]If I didn't get the devil, I might not have done it.
[308:20.59]Take the gold.
[308:28.77]5,500.
[308:28.89]Nice.
[308:35.86]Is there another one after that?
[308:36.66]Nope.
[308:39.98]What do I... I need 45,000.
[308:44.04]So I got a long way to go actually.
[308:45.88]I need some more missions.
[308:54.99]I'll do the mission over here.
[309:01.18]What's your favorite Star Trek?
[309:02.08]I actually have only watched... I'm probably going to make a lot of people mad.
[309:07.54]I think I've said this before, but, you know, there's a lot of new people here.
[309:11.40]Um... So... Star Trek Voyager is the Star Trek that I actually watched the whole thing through.
[309:28.05]I've seen a fair amount of The Next Generation.
[309:34.69]I've seen one clip from the original series because it was in a Jim Carrey movie.
[309:44.97]And I've not seen anything after that.
[309:47.33]I especially have not seen the Star Trek Rick and Morty edition.
[309:52.68]I haven't seen that one.
[309:53.72]I don't know anything about that one.
[310:00.90]I don't know anything about it.
[310:05.60]When I saw an advertisement for it, I really thought it was a Rick and Morty episode.
[310:12.11]We're all crazy.
[310:35.25]Both throw crazy?
[310:35.97]No, not anymore.
[310:39.83]Um, yeah, I've never seen it.
[310:47.34]What's the, what came after Next Generation?
[310:50.80]Was it Voyager?
[311:04.15]Oh, Deep Space Nine.
[311:05.35]That's right.
[311:05.65]I think I've seen some Deep Space Nine.
[311:07.94]Not very much, but I've seen a little bit.
[311:19.10]What's the one with, um, with, uh, why was six afraid of seven because seven ate nine?
[311:23.16]What was it?
[311:23.52]Who's that?
[311:24.34]Is that Deep Space Nine?
[311:34.93]That's Voyager, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[311:39.99]Careful, careful, careful.
[311:41.75]Oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[311:42.81]I'm in trouble.
[311:50.04]I'm sorry.
[311:57.42]He's got cubes.
[311:58.32]Don't let me down, dude.
[311:59.99]You can't end on a lie.
[312:03.99]Your next lot effect will always be Mustang.
[312:05.79]Good.
[312:10.02]You're reading chat too much.
[312:11.12]You would love Deep Space Nine.
[312:13.92]You would love Quark.
[312:14.70]He loves gambling.
[312:15.60]I don't love gambling.
[312:21.09]I just heavily enjoy RNG and Rift.
[312:45.32]So much healthier
[313:31.34]Excuse me.
[313:32.18]Excuse me.
[313:33.42]Excuse me.
[313:33.80]What's happening?
[313:35.06]Where's my face?
[313:35.74]Oh, he hit me with one of the parasites, right.
[313:57.33]I'm reading a bio paper right now.
[313:58.75]Thanks for the relaxing fight sounds.
[314:00.17]Hey, you're welcome.
[314:02.95]I'm about to fight the Nameless King for the first time.
[314:05.01]Don't tell him.
[314:25.68]Alright.
[314:26.04]I think I have enough now.
[314:28.82]Just barely enough.
[314:37.13]There's another fight mission over here.
[314:38.13]I need to refill my sushi because it's gotten me killed like two times now.
[315:08.70]Uh, straight ahead.
[315:13.18]Are you ever going to do anything familiar to the dollhouse in the future?
[315:19.35]Probably not.
[315:21.09]I'm going to do something hopefully to that scale.
[315:24.73]I want to do that more often.
[315:29.34]I'd kind of like to move on to the next thing.
[315:36.31]Come what I'm how would you jump that far?
[315:39.06]I'm trying to stay away from him Whatever
[316:02.79]I talked about this a few streams ago.
[316:04.55]It doesn't have to be that scale every time.
[316:08.17]I want each calendar year to have a couple of smaller scale streams, a couple of mid-scale streams, and a couple of large-scale streams.
[316:19.70]This is... Alright.
[316:24.52]Well... Space Peacock.
[316:28.96]Supergiant Bird Monster.
[316:32.78]Be sure to reveal his weak spot.
[316:34.12]Watch him closely.
[316:34.92]Something's got to be hiding in those colorful chairs.
[316:36.88]Is this Simon?
[316:37.48]It's Simon Says.
[316:41.20]Hey, Fly4Shy, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[316:44.76]Those, wait, those are tier 3.
[316:46.44]Holy shit, dude.
[316:47.30]10 tier 3 subs?
[316:51.96]What are you doing?
[316:55.03]Thank you.
[316:55.35]That's crazy.
[316:57.49]Where'd he go?
[317:02.22]Watch it.
[317:04.88]This guy's much more difficult than the other one.
[317:09.31]Oh my god, it's a lot to pay attention to.
[317:11.15]I can't... You know what's freaking me out about this?
[317:13.01]I can't move forward or backward.
[317:14.35]I can only move up or down.
[317:18.90]I wonder if the color is... Is it purple?
[317:20.62]I think it was purple.
[317:26.60]It is purple.
[317:28.16]Right?
[317:28.34]Yeah.
[317:28.44]I understand.
[317:30.28]I understand.
[317:37.09]How do I get away from that?
[317:38.01]Purple gone.
[317:43.12]Time for red.
[317:43.74]Where you going?
[317:52.98]Now what?
[318:00.67]Yellow.
[318:01.81]My health!
[318:06.22]Yikes.
[318:12.16]Blue.
[318:12.96]What is phase two going to be like then?
[318:29.79]He's sucking me up.
[318:38.08]Phase two.
[318:45.06]What is it?
[318:46.22]Right in the middle?
[318:47.84]In the head?
[318:48.32]In the back?
[318:58.14]Oh my goodness.
[318:59.38]I don't know.
[319:01.04]I'm just floating around in between these stupid pillars.
[319:03.01]In the back.
[319:08.98]Oh my god, it sucks to have to do this.
[319:13.94]Oh!
[319:15.41]Oh, I need to hit it one more time!
[319:20.07]That was actually hard.
[319:23.81]I got 50 subs.
[319:26.05]Bill Wanchalo.
[319:27.07]There's the 50 community subs.
[319:40.37]That's a lot.
[319:42.55]And 20 Tier 2?
[319:43.49]Who gave 20 Tier 2?
[319:48.51]Fly4Shy gave 20 Tier 2.
[319:49.69]That was 10 Tier 3 from Fly4Shy, 20 Tier 2 from Fly4Shy, and then 50 Tier 1 from Bill Wanchalo.
[320:03.02]And then... Oh my goodness gracious.
[320:15.20]That's absurd.
[320:15.78]That's a lot.
[320:17.78]Tier 3s and Tier 2s.
[320:28.23]Thanks a lot, guys.
[320:30.71]I got enough money.
[320:32.31]It is time to do the next boss.
[320:33.97]And then after that boss, we're going to call it.
[320:35.43]I'm going to get this scorpion right now.
[320:40.51]I'm not going to overthink it.
[320:41.37]I'm just going to get it.
[320:45.10]Don't even overthink it.
[320:45.94]Just stay behind him.
[320:47.90]And... Got it.
[320:53.03]Silver.
[320:54.77]How do I get out of here?
[321:02.00]I have to run all the way back here.
[321:14.70]We'll conclude today's stream after this fight and cutscenes and everything.
[321:19.74]And then, I will see you guys on Friday.
[321:23.54]The launch of WarioWare.
[321:26.16]And then we'll finish No More Heroes the next day.
[321:39.21]I'm just trying to get here as fast as I can.
[321:41.21]I don't even care.
[321:43.77]When are you gonna play Freddy Fish?
[321:45.03]I don't know, dude.
[321:48.19]That's steep, man.
[321:54.27]Yee-haw!
[322:04.35]On this planet, they say if you eat this before a showdown, it'll help you to win.
[322:09.31]How nice, Prince Foo.
[322:11.19]You do this for me?
[322:12.75]So happy.
[322:15.44]I swear to god if this guy dies before we get to see who it is.
[322:20.85]We have to assume it's gonna happen now, right?
[322:40.92]Delicious.
[322:42.20]Yeah, so delicious.
[322:44.34]So yummy.
[322:46.10]Super yummy.
[322:48.06]Do a prediction?
[322:49.24]Yeah, do a prediction.
[322:50.33]I don't know.
[322:51.41]Wait.
[322:52.09]I'll pause it before we see.
[322:54.79]Does this guy get baited and they die before we fight him?
[322:58.65]Yes or no?
[322:59.05]I'll go win.
[322:59.43]Go, Lee.
[323:07.85]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[323:08.77]If you already played the game, this is not an exclusive stream of the game that no one's ever done.
[323:15.40]That... What am I talking about?
[323:18.64]Half of you guys could have already beaten this game and just get free points.
[323:30.95]Damn.
[323:31.69]Okay, well, we're gonna upgrade.
[323:32.53]Huh.
[323:39.01]You could also just Google it.
[323:44.15]Yeah, don't do a prediction.
[323:45.11]That's right.
[323:48.17]If you lost that prediction, then I think that, holy shit, something would be wrong, right?
[323:51.45]Oh, no.
[323:54.47]Or that person really is just trying to play along.
[323:59.05]And they don't want to go look it up.
[324:00.15]So they actually have altruism.
[324:01.39]And they're actually like a good person.
[324:07.49]Points have been ruined by coin flips anyways.
[324:09.17]Alright, what do we got?
[324:16.21]I'm going to say... Attack, Battery... That's a lot.
[324:25.84]I'll do Attack.
[324:26.74]Attack or Health?
[324:28.80]Health.
[324:29.04]Do I have enough for Attack or another Health?
[324:36.74]I do.
[324:43.51]I have the sushi I need, and I can do it anyways after that.
[324:52.88]Let's just go.
[324:58.46]I can guess for debt off.
[325:01.75]Or if I'm wrong, debt gets added.
[325:19.23]To call a battle.
[325:19.91]100 million to get it right.
[325:25.08]100 million on it.
[325:27.06]Nah, that's not worth it.
[325:31.18]500 million off if you guessed right.
[325:35.74]But I can just Google it.
[325:37.04]And just go to the bathroom in quotes.
[325:40.02]That's not fair.
[325:59.62]Why would you spoil the game for yourself?
[326:00.96]Yeah, that's also true.
[326:02.76]Well, I mean, half a billion dollars of debt taken off is worth it.
[326:05.60]No, not doing it.
[326:21.31]I want to experience this game the way I want to experience the way it should be played.
[326:27.75]Doing it how I'm at my own pace.
[326:30.57]My own time.
[326:31.62]My own.
[326:35.08]Yes.
[326:36.76]Here we go.
[326:46.58]So this would be ranked number four.
[326:50.98]So then on Saturday, we'll have three ranked battles to do before getting to the end of the game.
[327:01.95]I don't think I have enough money to buy Sushi.
[327:03.17]Yeah, I've got five heals.
[327:22.27]Wait, is this a... Yeah, I got five heals.
[327:34.04]I can't afford the, uh... Eden sushi that I want.
[327:40.20]Plus, I don't want to waste money.
[327:41.09]I don't want to... Okay, can I make the prediction just for fun?
[327:52.31]Sniper Lee is going to get sniped in the head by somebody that's another sniper.
[327:55.58]This is going to be a different sniper.
[327:57.92]Here we go.
[327:58.24]Let's find out.
[328:21.78]There's a similar area in the other game.
[328:27.23]Travis.
[328:28.21]Yeah, we're being targeted.
[328:30.13]It's the next ranked assassin.
[328:32.39]You hear me, Travis?
[328:34.93]You got one minute left to live.
[328:38.39]That red mark don't lie.
[328:39.49]I'm a space sniper.
[328:52.33]Something feels wrong.
[328:54.33]What do you mean?
[328:55.53]This feeling.
[328:56.77]I've had it before.
[328:57.59]He's going to get sniped.
[328:58.49]Now I get excited.
[329:03.10]So beautiful.
[329:06.52]Headshots.
[329:07.32]You're so good.
[329:08.02]Headshots.
[329:09.06]Headshots all day.
[329:09.96]Every day.
[329:10.92]Is he holding the Enterprise?
[329:13.14]When the countdown ends, that's when he comes.
[329:17.75]Three, two, one.
[329:23.50]He did.
[329:23.90]He got sniped.
[329:27.16]Wow, I should have bet 500 billion.
[329:29.62]I should have bet half a billion dollars.
[329:31.96]Why did I not do that?
[329:33.28]I should have bet it.
[329:33.94]It's so... I knew it was going to happen.
[329:42.93]It's not him.
[329:44.39]Who is that?
[329:45.51]You know this guy?
[329:46.83]Nope.
[329:47.83]That's the entrance of someone big and important.
[329:53.46]Are you Travis?
[329:54.58]Yeah.
[329:57.62]Something wrong?
[329:59.17]No.
[329:59.95]Just some memories coming back, is all.
[330:02.93]I'm Notorious.
[330:04.85]You're tough.
[330:06.03]What's your story?
[330:07.47]I'm a superhero from Earth.
[330:09.55]And also, I'm the WWWW heavyweight champion.
[330:16.19]Holy shit!
[330:20.94]Ooh, this guy's a famous pro wrestler.
[330:23.48]Are you really THE Notorious?
[330:25.60]Like, for reals?
[330:27.06]Yeah.
[330:28.16]I had a couple of overlapping road shows and was a little late arriving for the whole threat to the planet thing.
[330:34.59]My apologies.
[330:36.21]You don't have shit to apologize for, man.
[330:38.69]But listen, I kinda feel like a hunter who's had his kill stolen from him.
[330:43.31]it pains me to hear this after all eliminating external threats is a superhero's duty are you really an actual superhero yeah albeit part-time but I am indeed a superhero champion please let me take the fight from here you go wait in the back champion I can't do that my duty is protecting this town is the duty of the people living here and I accepted their challenge
[331:15.54]Oh, is this a... Oh, don't do it.
[331:16.40]Don't do it!
[331:43.34]Oh, they're just friends.
[331:44.16]Okay.
[331:44.88]I thought he was gonna like spin me around and throw me.
[331:50.12]This one apparently got skipped.
[331:52.59]Next up is the number three ranked assassin.
[331:56.15]But this is going against the rules.
[331:59.73]It's no fun without any boss fights, right?
[332:04.33]Was that her eye or her clipboard?
[332:05.59]Okay.
[332:05.83]Um.
[332:05.95]Hold on.
[332:06.49]What the fuck?
[332:32.91]What the fuck is going on in this game?
[332:36.77]Something weird is coming.
[332:38.95]Who is it now?
[332:42.61]Switching to blue.
[332:46.79]All power systems functioning.
[332:49.49]This silhouette...
[332:53.37]That's destroy man.
[332:54.99]That's fucking destroy man.
[332:56.97]They just had to put him in the game.
[332:58.75]They had to find a way.
[332:59.81]Destroy man.
[333:09.62]Another handshake.
[333:10.94]Looks like the main character from Frisky Dingo.
[333:14.35]What's that guy's name?
[333:43.27]Kill face, yeah.
[333:52.91]So they had a switch boss fight into another switch boss fight.
[333:56.66]Seriously?
[334:03.50]This guy seriously...
[334:06.79]Why are we fighting this guy?
[334:07.91]He just came out of the ground.
[334:08.95]I don't understand.
[334:11.59]This guy is seriously dumb.
[334:14.43]He totally believed me.
[334:16.53]Oh, God.
[334:17.65]Oh, God.
[334:18.17]I'm going to die.
[334:21.04]I'm going to laugh myself to death.
[334:24.50]Oh, shit.
[334:25.64]Oh, I'm dying.
[334:27.88]Oh, my God.
[334:28.72]This guy is so stupid.
[334:33.20]I don't fucking think so.
[334:34.58]No.
[334:34.72]No.
[334:41.05]What?
[334:43.23]Oh, we didn't even get to fight him either.
[334:45.62]Wait, what?
[334:51.92]Oh, it's all destroy man bots.
[334:53.66]It's just man versus machine.
[334:55.06]Oh.
[335:14.88]Oh, God.
[335:15.80]This is gonna be horrible.
[335:18.87]Mass-produced destroy man.
[335:21.63]Third time's the charm.
[335:23.35]They'll attack in droves, so take them down with your death glove skills.
[335:26.27]Don't underestimate that destroy cannon.
[335:28.83]How many times is this guy gonna come back to life with his head spinning like that?
[335:31.51]He's freaking me out.
[335:34.03]Ay-yi-yi.
[335:38.32]Ow.
[335:43.45]Wait, he sucks.
[335:45.02]He's like falling down.
[335:46.04]It's like Curly Larry and Moe.
[335:47.52]One of them's just stupid.
[336:05.58]What the fuck are they doing?
[336:10.77]Oh, almost a 7-7-7.
[336:11.51]Ooh, that hurt.
[336:15.21]Let me guess.
[336:16.41]I gotta fight 5 and then level 10.
[336:36.40]I like the sound, sounds like I'm gonna have a Game Boy.
[336:52.79]How do I do the dodge?
[336:54.78]Is it AA?
[337:08.58]I could have just killed that guy.
[337:12.18]That's two, right?
[337:16.61]Yep.
[337:42.13]You hit me?
[337:42.37]I thought it was AB at the same time.
[337:44.38]It is AB at the same time.
[337:46.52]You're a genius.
[337:47.04]Thank you.
[337:48.72]Oh, okay.
[337:52.32]It's going to get hairy.
[337:55.60]Okay.
[338:14.00]Battery.
[338:14.52]I dodged that.
[338:16.22]My mistake.
[338:20.67]Invincible mode.
[338:22.57]Let's go.
[338:41.83]What is happening?
[338:43.01]I just beat him.
[338:43.63]With my incredibly powerful abilities.
[339:10.32]What the fuck?
[339:11.68]There are millions of them.
[339:12.96]Maybe not.
[339:14.52]This is pretty fucked up, Travis.
[339:16.74]All battles must end.
[339:18.90]Here we go.
[339:20.71]Travis, get away from there.
[339:22.71]What?
[339:23.49]Jam.
[339:24.61]I cast your cannon.
[339:25.73]Did you get him?
[339:32.15]Travis, I've located the enemy.
[339:34.71]The real one is down below.
[339:36.91]Leave this to me and get to Central Magna.
[339:40.15]Uh... The cat!
[339:40.85]Let's at least hold on to the cat.
[339:43.02]Oh, goodness.
[339:44.12]Oh, mega destroy man.
[340:09.64]Now let's have a fair fight.
[340:13.50]So this is the real one, huh?
[340:15.52]This place, it's been turned into a Destroy Man factory.
[340:19.52]What the fuck are you even trying to do, you weird-ass bastard?
[340:23.84]I'm Destroy Man, the superhero.
[340:27.60]I destroy the evils of this world.
[340:30.93]Evil assassin Travis Touchdown.
[340:37.87]Okay, let's go.
[340:38.59]Alright, real fight incoming.
[340:39.98]Bring it on!
[340:40.60]That was sneaky, wasn't it?
[341:04.91]He's got a lot of health.
[341:05.91]This is gonna be a long fight.
[341:06.93]Ow.
[341:07.53]Okay, easy, easy, easy.
[341:10.39]Alright, I gotta run.
[341:15.05]Alright, dodge.
[341:33.31]Holy shit, he just double tapped me.
[341:35.27]I forgot they were in the air.
[341:36.11]Okay, I gotta... Walk around, walk around.
[341:39.87]Don't be an idiot.
[341:40.93]I gotta check his moves out.
[341:42.61]I gotta wait for this.
[341:46.83]Okay, those have to get ran into the wall, for sure.
[341:49.09]Destroy punch!
[341:59.38]Destroy punch!
[342:04.95]Alright, let's go.
[342:09.47]Fuck.
[342:10.27]Oh, those things are so hard to dodge.
[342:11.94]That was a good spring.
[342:22.50]Alright.
[342:46.67]Come here.
[343:00.04]Stunned?
[343:00.50]I thought he was stunned.
[343:04.46]Alright, phase two incoming.
[343:06.62]Alright, move back.
[343:21.97]That's a huge AoE.
[343:26.55]Okay.
[343:27.47]Alright.
[343:27.77]He's got a few more moves.
[343:32.57]I can't just outrun him.
[343:33.57]Fuck.
[343:33.99]Okay.
[343:34.29]That was really, really close.
[343:35.65]That would have been bad.
[343:37.15]I can't outrun those.
[343:42.94]Oh, yeah.
[343:43.78]Oh, yeah.
[343:44.34]Oh, yeah.
[343:44.66]Let's go.
[343:46.62]That's lucky shit right there, let's move.
[343:49.38]Oh hell yeah.
[343:52.54]I just killed him.
[343:57.49]That was lucky shit right there.
[343:59.79]Nice, okay.
[344:01.77]Rolled sevens.
[344:03.95]Easy.
[344:20.68]destroy man true face dead you just skip the boss pretty much although I'm not on the hardest difficulty though I'm on the medium difficulty there's a difficulty after this there's probably another difficulty after that when you beat the game so the game probably gets a thousand times harder if you're on the spiciest
[344:47.17]I'm not on the spicy difficulty.
[344:52.29]Champ.
[344:53.70]He was an unaffiliated terrorist.
[344:56.00]He took money from militaries around the world.
[344:58.03]I'm not playing on easy.
[344:58.63]I'm playing on bitter.
[344:59.27]He tried to mass produce himself to take over the Globes.
[345:02.57]Have you been watching him?
[345:04.17]Yeah, I was observing him.
[345:06.35]Thanks to you, I was able to stop him.
[345:09.69]He was one tenacious dude.
[345:12.01]Yeah, you got that right.
[345:13.58]Alright, champ.
[345:15.22]Let's run.
[345:16.36]Let's.
[345:21.20]Whoa!
[345:41.57]Yuck.
[345:45.16]That was rocky, oh.
[345:53.87]Somebody said this seemed a little undertuned for what is medium effectively.
[345:57.95]Can I really hire you to do this?
[346:00.19]If it's a contract, I won't turn it down.
[346:03.42]Kill this man.
[346:04.50]Maybe a little.
[346:04.96]What's the price tag?
[346:06.52]Some of them have been pretty challenging.
[346:09.18]30% of the total stock.
[346:11.18]Convert it into cash, and you'll be a very rich man.
[346:14.97]Sounds like a good plan.
[346:17.41]I'll take the job.
[346:20.33]How does he not getting hit by-
[347:03.74]Alright, is that... I've... I don't... I... Whatever.
[347:11.50]There's nothing I can really say right now.
[347:22.95]This is just a series of weird dreams that Suda51 stitched together and made a video game.
[347:32.25]Stuff has like no beginnings or ends.
[347:35.81]Just middles.
[347:39.18]And then ends.
[347:39.72]There's middles and ends.
[347:47.00]It's just insane.
[347:51.30]I love it though.
[347:52.02]I think it's hilarious.
[347:52.89]I think it's wonderful.
[347:53.81]It's always climaxing.
[348:00.91]Yeah.
[348:05.34]It's just out of context, everything.
[348:15.34]No exposition, just context.
[348:23.69]This is the best No More Heroes game so far.
[348:26.31]You know, now that I'm almost done with it, like another probably few hours, that really depends on what you want.
[348:35.66]Because I think this experience has been the best one.
[348:41.90]But I think the first game is more of like almost like a true video game than this one is.
[348:48.36]This seems like a series of interesting things stitched together.
[348:52.69]And the characters are all hilarious and everything is just funny and crazy and out of this world.
[348:59.34]I think the first one is actually like a video game.
[349:02.94]This feels less like a video game and more like almost like an interactive dream experience.
[349:09.86]And this one has an actual big open world to kind of go around.
[349:12.62]I'll be honest, it's not that interesting.
[349:15.20]The actual physical open world is not that... I mean, they put NPCs moving around that you can run into with your car.
[349:23.96]For me personally, this is the best one.
[349:28.08]But if you're more into, I guess, more of a structured video game, the first two are probably what you're looking for.
[349:37.65]This feels like a lot less structured than the other two, but somehow I like it better than the other two.
[349:45.61]I don't see Damon.
[349:47.47]I have not heard from him in several days.
[349:50.15]What happened with Sonic Juice?
[349:51.23]It's more of a hub.
[349:51.97]I cannot get a hold of Mr. Juice either.
[349:55.69]He's probably off training again.
[349:57.43]Sonic is a tough guy.
[349:59.23]I mean, it's my fight, but still.
[350:05.05]Okay.
[350:12.22]There was something wrong with me there.
[350:13.76]I spent too much time fucking around.
[350:16.88]How many hours of gaming per day?
[350:18.96]Ten hours.
[350:20.33]Oh, wait.
[350:20.79]That's too much.
[350:21.39]That's too much playing.
[350:22.89]It should be like an hour, right?
[350:25.47]Ten hours is too much.
[350:26.33]I've gotten too caught up in gaming.
[350:28.95]I'm sick of video games.
[350:42.00]wake up who is it oh I'm still sleepy so you can't even beat your desire to sleep huh he's just killed him he's just killing this guy and we're not gonna be able to fight this one how long are you gonna sleep
[351:13.87]They just gave up on these bosses.
[351:21.56]They just don't give a fuck about these bosses at all.
[351:24.08]There's no rhyme or... When I talk about structure, this is what I was referring to.
[351:27.40]There's zero structure.
[351:29.52]It's just... It's nothing.
[351:31.73]It's just all... Nobody matters.
[351:33.11]Nothing matters.
[351:35.07]Travis, Touchdown, and Fu are the only characters that matter in the game, and maybe Damon.
[351:38.59]That's it.
[351:39.15]Nothing else matters.
[351:48.94]and something about that is kind of refreshing in a way that like who gives a shit about any of this you forgot about gold Joe the big problem is miike's comedies you want to watch the mo song one more time no we should go back to zebra man yeah miike and kuro go great together
[352:16.94]Kudo's comedy is complicated, you know?
[352:19.57]So now there are only two left?
[352:20.69]Yeah, there's only two people left.
[352:23.15]Kudo's scripts are really strong.
[352:24.57]He always ends up leaning on the words.
[352:27.05]And Miike uses his imagery to push back without leaving all the work to Kudo's words.
[352:32.36]Push back!
[352:33.10]It's Charlotte.
[352:41.31]Hey, you want a beer?
[352:51.03]Damn, that's good.
[352:53.03]I've been revitalized.
[352:55.89]You're finally doing better, huh, Charlotte?
[352:58.43]Quit calling me that.
[353:00.77]It's a nice name.
[353:02.03]It suits you.
[353:03.31]I'll fucking kill you.
[353:06.81]I'll fucking kill you.
[353:09.29]Miike?
[353:10.44]Who's that?
[353:11.66]For reals?
[353:13.18]You don't know Miike?
[353:14.82]He's like a film super director from Japan.
[353:17.99]If it's Japanese stuff, give me anime.
[353:20.63]What anime do you like?
[353:22.41]Lotons or Dougram.
[353:24.47]Seriously?
[353:26.53]Were those two real shows?
[353:28.55]My dad was a Takahashi fan.
[353:31.31]I see.
[353:32.33]He's got good taste.
[353:33.45]Knock it the fuck off.
[353:35.19]Don't get cute.
[353:37.27]Let's watch it together.
[353:39.13]All I got is Leisner, though.
[353:41.91]Nice.
[353:42.77]And beer.
[353:44.33]Let's drink.
[353:51.93]Aye, aye, aye.
[353:52.65]Okay.
[353:55.93]What a mess.
[353:58.54]This game is a mess.
[354:02.30]It's wonderful.
[354:03.30]Okay.
[354:04.10]Well, I'm going to save it here.
[354:07.84]Wait.
[354:08.50]Is there any new games with Gene?
[354:19.33]Well, let's save it.
[354:22.17]Alright.
[354:23.89]That's gonna be it.
[354:26.03]This has been wonderful.
[354:26.87]We will finish this, uh, this coming weekend here.
[354:29.19]I got a feeling there's probably at least another three hours left in the game.
[354:34.14]Somewhere between two and four.
[354:38.50]There's still an entire area that I have not been to.
[354:40.82]I think.
[354:43.36]So, I'm assuming there's probably at least another two or three hours.
[354:47.14]Three-ish hours, yeah.
[354:49.01]I'm not gonna complete it tonight.
[354:51.63]So the next time you see this stream live, we'll be playing WarioWare.
[354:55.05]Get it together.
[354:55.81]I wish I... This has been insane.
[354:59.72]Somebody said this the other day.
[355:02.28]I'm being spoiled.
[355:04.60]Two of my favorite franchises have had brand new games come out that have not had really new games come out in their series in a very long time.
[355:16.20]I've been waiting for No More Heroes 3, like a game like this, third person, No More Heroes 3, since probably a year after No More Heroes 2 came out.
[355:25.30]This is awesome.
[355:26.64]I've been waiting for a real WarioWare game since Smooth Moves.
[355:31.91]So, we're getting two 10-year sequels here in the first two weeks.
[355:41.72]So, I'm very excited.
[355:43.94]I will see you guys soon.
[355:45.76]Friday.
[355:47.10]We're going to be streaming at 2 p.m.
[355:49.18]Pacific on Friday.
[355:50.19]I'm going to pull it back.
[355:51.75]I'm not going to do 4 p.m.
[355:52.65]anymore.
[355:52.91]I'm going to pull it back to 2.
[356:02.03]So, I'll see you Friday.
[356:03.65]We're going to have a lot of community subs here through these credits.
[356:09.51]There was a shitload of subs given.
[356:13.62]And Psychonauts 2, yeah, I forgot about Psychonauts.
[356:15.42]What's with these games that have been celebrated for a decade that just all the sequels came out?
[356:25.53]But if you're curious if you should buy No More Heroes 3, I would say yes.
[356:29.35]Absolutely.
[356:29.79]If you're a fan of this franchise and you think it's an interesting place, interesting concept, yeah.
[356:35.22]It looks like there's a shitload of content that's not the actual main game either.
[356:39.18]The time machine to go back and fight bosses at a harder difficulty for materials.
[356:44.67]That's cool.
[356:51.61]Did he beat the game?
[356:52.21]No, I did not.
[356:54.45]You will see the end of this game on Saturday of this coming week.
[356:58.16]I want to make room for WarioWare.
[356:59.28]Remember, I am twice a week, Andy.
[357:08.98]It's only on the Switch.
[357:09.98]As of right now, No More Heroes 3 is only on the Switch.
[357:14.00]So who knows if the coming next six months, a year or whatever, it might show its face on PC or Xbox or something.
[357:21.61]The other two did.
[357:23.07]We'll see.
[357:33.67]It makes it more special that it's on the Switch.
[357:37.77]It's nice to see Nintendo have exclusives that are not just first party stuff.
[357:44.69]Worth having the console for.
[357:45.91]I think the Switch is a really good console, but... Kind of adds just to it, right?
[358:01.78]It's time for tuna.
[358:02.76]It is time for tuna.
[358:05.24]A tuna melt.
[358:07.04]Of all things.
[358:12.31]Hold on.
[358:12.77]What kind of cheese am I going to get, though?
[358:15.25]Do I have cheese?
[358:16.63]Oh shit, this is a disaster.
[358:20.51]This is a disaster in the making.
[358:22.55]I don't know if I have cheese.
[358:25.91]You can't have a tuna melt without the melt portion.
[358:28.83]That doesn't work.
[358:29.39]Uh-oh.
[358:35.31]That's bad news.
[358:40.68]Do I have... I gotta see if I have cheese.
[358:43.87]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[358:45.06]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[358:46.10]Goodbye.
[358:46.84]Goodnight.
[358:47.62]Take care of yourselves.
[358:48.64]Thanks for watching as always.
[358:54.91]I'll see you soon.
[358:57.95]Don't forget about me.
[358:58.65]I won't forget about you.
[359:01.72]No, goodnight.
[359:02.24]I'll see you later.
[359:30.49]you
[360:05.38]you
