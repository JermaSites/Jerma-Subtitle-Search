[00:02.62]Oh, alright.
[00:03.48]Hello.
[00:03.82]Fuck this dog hair all over my boomer vitamins.
[00:09.51]No.
[00:11.07]I just, like, touched him.
[00:12.11]I just, like, petted him.
[00:12.83]I was like, okay, Otto, it's time to start the stream.
[00:16.61]Now I've got fucking dog hair all over my boomer vitamins.
[00:22.09]Yeah, sorry I'm late today.
[00:24.29]I had some major pee.
[00:27.16]Okay, hold on a second.
[00:28.84]Let's take, hold on.
[00:30.35]Okay.
[00:31.27]I had some major PC fan issues that I have since resolved.
[00:35.05]Let's hope my computer doesn't explode.
[00:37.05]That my case fan stops spinning.
[00:42.21]All of them.
[00:43.30]The front ones.
[00:44.86]So I had to figure out why that was.
[00:46.70]So, you know, I'll take it apart.
[00:48.16]Plugged it back in.
[00:48.88]Changed it.
[00:49.76]Fucked with the power supply.
[00:51.64]Here's the TL;DR for all of you.
[00:55.64]There are one, two, three...
[00:58.15]four case fans in here uh one of them is permanently just doesn't work anymore so I really hope that my 3090 is not going to burn out because one of the case fans doesn't turn on but we're good I might turn the graphics down a little bit
[01:17.44]You're lying.
[01:18.50]I'm not lying.
[01:20.98]I swear to God.
[01:23.24]I don't know.
[01:23.80]I have this.
[01:24.44]This is a 30.
[01:25.06]I'm on a 3090 right now.
[01:27.49]You can make fun of me all you want.
[01:28.57]I got this is a 3090.
[01:29.73]You'll see it.
[01:30.23]This is the first real stream that you're going to see with 3090.
[01:37.15]What game have I played in the last like three or four weeks that required anything more than like a fucking 780?
[01:48.49]That hasn't happened.
[01:51.03]The invisible hand?
[01:51.85]That did not require a 3090.
[01:52.79]That wasn't getting the full capabilities of the 3090.
[01:55.03]Um, anyways.
[01:58.54]Today, yes, we're going to play Resident Evil Village.
[02:00.98]I have no idea how long this stream is going to be.
[02:04.30]I plan on going two days.
[02:06.20]I might just get obsessed with it.
[02:08.00]And play a shitload of it tonight.
[02:09.52]I might be like, after four or five hours, you know what?
[02:11.32]Fuck this.
[02:11.68]I'll see you tomorrow.
[02:13.34]We'll see.
[02:13.70]It's so rushed.
[02:16.93]Even if I give myself an extra hour, it doesn't matter.
[02:18.77]I'm sitting there, like, taking my computer apart, going like, I gotta be live in, like, fucking 45 minutes!
[02:25.48]Every second counts.
[02:26.92]I get pissed off when I have to pee.
[02:30.20]You ever get pushed against a clock, and, like, a 60-second piss infuriates you?
[02:36.58]I'm just sitting there going like, hurry the fuck up!
[02:40.84]Why?
[02:41.28]I drank too much water today!
[02:44.40]That's 60 seconds that I couldn't have been inside the computer.
[02:50.58]You're a goof.
[02:51.26]No, I'm telling you.
[02:55.05]Alright.
[02:55.87]Yes, we're doing facecam today.
[02:58.49]Let me tweet this.
[02:59.12]I'll be right back.
[03:00.02]Give me a second.
[03:48.89]Wait, it's, it's not, it's not village?
[03:53.83]It's V-I-L-L-A-G-E.
[03:57.77]I thought it was V-I-L-L-I-A-G-E, like village.
[04:02.50]Like a village.
[04:03.96]A village.
[04:05.50]It's village?
[04:07.12]I thought it was village, like welcome to the village.
[04:10.16]I, I, I, well, people must think I've been really stupid over the years.
[04:13.07]I've never, I've never done A. It's I-A.
[04:16.05]Village.
[04:19.37]I don't know why I'm still holding these.
[04:22.37]Okay.
[04:23.49]I'm holding these for some reason.
[04:25.53]I want to take these on stream and I think it's like funny for some reason.
[04:29.81]Like, I don't know.
[04:31.57]Explain to me why I think this is funny.
[04:34.15]Oh, hold on.
[04:35.37]Taking my turmeric.
[04:37.23]Wait, why is that funny?
[04:38.59]Oh, taking my like B vitamins.
[04:42.35]Like, why do I think they're taking like drugs?
[04:44.13]These aren't even drugs.
[04:44.95]They're fucking natural supplements.
[04:50.71]They're not essential oils.
[04:51.83]It's fucking supplements.
[04:53.63]It's turmeric.
[04:54.25]I'm taking it.
[04:54.75]It's my pain shit.
[04:55.99]You know, I gotta try something.
[04:59.83]What is this?
[05:02.35]Oh.
[05:02.73]Oh, yeah.
[05:03.09]Right.
[05:03.33]I forgot.
[05:04.84]Yeah, this is a Fiji water.
[05:06.46]Hold on.
[05:11.96]There's not actually Fiji water in here.
[05:15.10]See, when I finish a Fiji bottle, I just refill it with regular water.
[05:19.70]I still walk around and drink it so people think I'm fucking very high class.
[05:23.56]Fucking pro tip.
[05:26.94]There's actually just regular water in here.
[05:30.25]That's illegal?
[05:30.87]Illegal?
[05:39.83]He's pissed?
[05:40.75]No, I just have very, very negative energy right now.
[05:44.50]I'm trying to expel it before we start playing the game.
[05:54.64]Oh, by the way, if you thought those were supplements... You're fucking... I have no idea.
[06:01.03]You'll see in 40 minutes where I can't even fucking read writing.
[06:07.45]It's turmeric and B vitamins.
[06:08.61]Give it a rest.
[06:11.27]Alright, so this is gonna be interesting.
[06:13.13]Hopefully these fans work.
[06:14.51]See how big my arms look today?
[06:16.67]Alright, this is Resident Evil Village.
[06:17.89]Hold on.
[06:20.31]Right when the edibles kick in.
[06:24.32]He's getting zonked.
[06:25.24]No, those are not... Why would it be... I told you it's turmeric.
[06:30.86]Hope you guys had a good week.
[06:34.56]Remember, I found the piss bottle.
[06:37.42]Let's not pee, either.
[06:39.70]Why is my... What are you doing, webcam?
[06:40.82]Don't do that.
[06:41.16]Alright, what's a good place for the webcam?
[06:43.06]Right here?
[06:43.34]Hopefully I don't get scared.
[06:46.77]Oh, and you don't think I have more than one beverage at this table.
[06:49.97]I'm prepared.
[06:50.57]I always am.
[06:52.92]That's the thing about being a streamer.
[06:53.94]Somebody said, oh, what's it like being a streamer?
[06:56.34]Do you have any advice?
[06:57.36]Yes.
[06:58.38]Have literally every liquid you want to consume and all the food you want to eat for the whole day on the desk when you start the stream.
[07:06.07]That's the only advice I'm going to give you.
[07:13.23]Okay.
[07:14.65]Looks good.
[07:15.03]We're going to start.
[07:16.11]Resident Evil Village on the brand new 3090.
[07:18.04]Okay.
[07:21.11]Not doing it on hardcore, no thanks.
[07:23.91]Is the cam too big?
[07:24.53]You guys hear it?
[07:31.50]Village of Shadows.
[07:34.28]Long ago, a young girl went with her mother to pick berries for her father, who was hard at work.
[07:40.76]But the forest greeted them with a dark, cold silence.
[07:43.94]The bushes emptied.
[07:45.79]I got it.
[07:46.40]Yet determined to find the berries, the rascal broke free from his grasp and vanished into the trees.
[07:53.13]Mother's worried cries faded fast as the girl ran on over vine and under branch and into the forest deep.
[08:00.23]Feeling strange eyes upon her, the girl recalled Mother's scary bedtime tales and her throat became bone dry.
[08:07.80]Then the Bat Lord appeared.
[08:09.76]He greeted her warmly and bit his own wing.
[08:13.18]Come, child, quench you a thirst, he said.
[08:16.44]So she drank the thick, dark blood and smiled with joy.
[08:21.09]Passing through the graveyard, menacing storm clouds loomed, and the air turned... This is the right game?
[08:27.07]What a game is this?
[08:27.99]The girl was shivering in her thin clothes.
[08:30.53]Then, a dark weaver appeared, and with a clip of his fingers, crafted mist into a beautiful dress.
[08:37.92]Come, child, warm yourself, he coaxed.
[08:41.58]So she clothed herself and smiled with joy.
[08:48.49]This is the wrong game?
[08:50.81]No, it's not.
[08:51.95]Is this the wrong game?
[08:53.27]I'm losing my mind.
[08:55.93]Then the fish king appeared and offered one of his many fins.
[09:03.82]Come, child, eat your fill.
[09:06.64]So the girl ate and smiled with joy once more.
[09:11.53]Continuing on, she soon entered the forest's dark heart.
[09:16.64]Then an iron steed appeared, bearing a beautiful golden gear.
[09:21.54]I just wanted to cut to somebody's, like, nose getting closed in a book.
[09:24.93]And snatched what she thought was another gift.
[09:27.47]You know what I mean?
[09:27.95]Like, and that's the end of the story.
[09:29.17]Like, right here.
[09:30.61]The horse grew angry and summoned the other monsters.
[09:36.39]Terror filled the girl's heart as a wild wind rose around the beast.
[09:41.76]Suddenly, a witch appeared.
[09:43.88]Dark, yet regal.
[09:50.23]Come on.
[09:50.61]Oh, I just... Skin came off my mouth.
[09:52.41]What was that?
[09:52.89]What's going on?
[09:53.35]Yes, we gave, but more you took, she snarled.
[09:55.75]Oh, well, don't do it to the baby.
[09:56.91]So more in turn is due.
[09:59.77]In a blink, the girl was trapped inside a mirror.
[10:05.65]Babies can't even fucking understand English right now.
[10:08.61]She's asleep.
[10:09.25]You literally could have just said banana, carrot, strawberry over and over again.
[10:12.17]That is a creepy story.
[10:13.03]She's only six months old.
[10:15.60]Woman at the store said it was traditional.
[10:19.03]A local tale.
[10:21.59]Besides, Rose doesn't seem to mind.
[10:24.28]I'm getting a little screen tearing.
[10:25.36]What's going on, 3090?
[10:26.80]Thank God.
[10:28.24]We moved here so that she wouldn't have to deal with any of that, remember?
[10:30.70]There's nothing wrong with my memory.
[10:34.52]You're just being paranoid.
[10:36.38]It's not... Never mind.
[10:39.16]I'm sorry.
[10:40.50]But I'm not paranoid.
[10:41.66]I'm just cautious.
[10:43.26]Then, go cautiously take your daughter to bed.
[10:49.24]I heard there's a lot of weird PC problems in this game.
[10:51.17]Is there one of them?
[10:54.61]I hate this.
[10:56.57]I don't like this.
[10:59.23]If somebody wants me to hold their baby, I hate to decline, but I do because I feel like I'm going to break it.
[11:06.55]You know what I mean?
[11:10.09]It's like, why don't you hold the baby?
[11:11.72]I don't think so.
[11:13.14]How do we hold it?
[11:17.60]And they teach you, oh, what you do is you support the head, and you put the neck up, and you have to make sure that it goes that way.
[11:23.00]Rest the bum.
[11:24.09]It's like, can I just watch you do it?
[11:25.99]I don't want to fucking do it.
[11:26.67]Alright, yeah, the graphics are fucking, what's going on here?
[11:31.97]I know, look, I know I'm not utilizing the extent of the 3090.
[11:35.49]I'm scared, because one of my fans doesn't work.
[11:38.79]So look, look, I got 23 gigabytes of available memory, but I'm afraid of the fucking overheating.
[11:45.39]So I turned it down a little.
[11:48.33]But I need to fix this.
[11:49.79]Why is it?
[11:50.29]Is it VSync?
[11:52.57]I make my frame rate the same as the refresh rate.
[11:54.37]Is that the problem?
[11:55.67]Or should I just turn on VSync?
[11:59.17]Why is it doing that?
[12:01.85]Yes, yes.
[12:02.43]But what if it makes the graphics card go faster?
[12:07.93]Oh, that didn't fix it.
[12:08.93]I'm still getting a bunch of screen tearing.
[12:11.87]How am I getting screen tearing?
[12:17.03]I have to turn on VSync.
[12:19.40]Doesn't V-Sync give you input lag, though?
[12:20.88]I feel like I'm going to complain about that.
[12:26.38]Did I just do it?
[12:27.82]Well, let's see.
[12:28.38]Yeah, I got input lag now.
[12:36.69]I'll see how I fare for a little while.
[12:38.65]V-Sync off.
[12:44.98]Fuck it up.
[12:48.60]Okay, I'll be fine.
[12:49.32]Whatever.
[12:49.56]Alright, let's go.
[12:50.30]Alright, so what I have to do?
[12:52.41]Feed the baby.
[12:53.39]Oh, this looks fucking beautiful on a 3090, if I will say.
[12:56.27]Oh, wait.
[12:56.53]You guys can't even see that because I forgot to do that.
[12:59.61]So, like, on the next stream, I'm going to up the quality of the stream to, like, 900p.
[13:02.51]What do we got?
[13:07.62]Tomato.
[13:09.36]Bread.
[13:11.84]Do it now?
[13:12.32]I can't do it now.
[13:12.92]It's not going to work.
[13:18.70]We just eat bread and sauce?
[13:21.42]Wait, what is that?
[13:24.20]Don't get too close to me when I'm cooking, babe.
[13:27.50]Did you take this?
[13:28.26]Oh, right.
[13:29.80]Watch out for that splattering hot oil!
[13:33.14]Is it a European diet?
[13:35.50]Bread, sauce, and apples is European?
[13:37.96]What are you talking about?
[13:44.86]What's this?
[13:46.16]Oh, baby food.
[13:47.76]I have to change that one.
[13:50.70]I hate F as I can examine.
[13:52.67]I'm going to make it one of the mouse buttons, maybe.
[13:55.35]Ah, wait.
[13:55.77]We'll see.
[13:56.49]Give me like 20 minutes.
[13:57.13]We'll see if I hate it.
[14:00.33]What's the sprint button?
[14:05.61]How's the audio for you guys?
[14:06.41]Is it good?
[14:13.07]Alright, put the baby to bed.
[14:14.09]Wait, is this, um... Those of you that haven't seen Resident Evil 7 or haven't played Resident Evil 7... I don't have no fucking idea why you're watching this without... If you want, like... This is... I'm gonna talk about the 7 to 7 thing.
[14:24.05]Is this the house?
[14:26.03]Is this the original family's house?
[14:27.59]This is like the original house.
[14:30.05]That's cool.
[14:30.47]No, it's not.
[14:31.13]You sure?
[14:45.35]I hate two hands.
[14:47.93]Two hands, man.
[14:48.49]It's like a bicycle.
[14:56.77]Oh my god, that's the top of the cake from our wedding day.
[14:59.41]I think I gotta turn the brightness down.
[15:09.98]Oh wait, I have to kill these.
[15:11.62]Please interact with the monkey toy.
[15:17.17]Thanks for the spoiler.
[15:26.25]Wait, is this the baby's sleep?
[15:27.76]No.
[15:28.10]I'm not like... Wait, why are we... This is like kind of bad.
[15:31.80]Why am I bringing the baby into like the weird dusty room?
[15:35.24]Somebody else will read this.
[15:37.63]Somebody else will read this.
[15:38.47]I hate reading these.
[15:39.49]I know people are going to get so pissed about this, but I fucking hate reading these.
[15:42.99]I just wish somebody would just say it, like, uh, BioShock.
[15:47.57]And I mean, like, just let me pick up a fucking tape and just play it in my ear.
[15:51.77]Like, even Diablo 3 got this right.
[15:54.01]And that game was fucking dog shit.
[15:56.79]Well, for the first year or two.
[16:01.73]Everyone's forgotten about this already.
[16:05.61]He wouldn't pay attention anyways.
[16:07.43]Well, at least... I mean, I've fallen asleep listening to audiobooks and, like, 12 chapters go by and I wake up and I'm, like, a third of the way through the book.
[16:17.43]I'm just like, well... Oh, well.
[16:19.41]Alright, I have to play with a monkey toy.
[16:28.60]Wherever the monkey toy is.
[16:29.94]Almost there, honey.
[16:32.12]I'm not gonna get screamed at, right?
[16:33.26]I mean, this is...
[16:37.67]I can't do two headphones.
[16:38.63]No, I have to hear myself talk.
[16:43.19]That's a cool toy.
[16:43.87]Alright, wait, wait.
[16:45.81]Play with the monkey toy.
[16:48.23]Roses close for tomorrow.
[16:49.43]Can you guys hear me?
[16:49.99]I think we need to move the mic.
[16:56.39]I don't see a monkey toy.
[16:58.17]Play with the monkey toy?
[16:59.29]I don't see a monkey toy.
[17:11.30]Ah, I see a monkey toy now.
[17:12.58]I thought a car was gonna hit us.
[17:29.98]I thought a car was gonna crash into us.
[17:33.10]I was supposed to scream.
[17:35.42]I was like, what the fuck?
[17:39.90]I just hear... Yeah, yeah.
[17:45.52]Rosemary winters.
[17:47.41]Screenings, hearing, vision, touch, reflex.
[17:49.21]They're all good.
[17:49.97]Patient's good.
[17:54.39]You're on the second floor.
[17:55.41]I don't know.
[17:55.71]I could have gone off and jumped.
[17:58.87]Me and I had another fight.
[17:59.92]I accidentally mentioned what happened three years ago and she blew up at me.
[18:03.42]We finally settled down in our new life in Europe and can bring Rose up properly.
[18:07.71]But I still feel like a part of me is trapped in that hellhole back in Louisiana.
[18:10.83]So this is talking about the seventh game.
[18:14.65]I know Mia doesn't like to talk about it, but can we really just forget everything and pretend it didn't happen?
[18:19.11]Shouldn't we face what happened there so we can live our lives with Rose without it hanging over our heads?
[18:25.41]We owe her that much at least.
[18:26.56]I know Mia knows this.
[18:27.82]She wouldn't have exploded like that at the hospital if she didn't care.
[18:30.66]Alright, let's put this kid to bed.
[18:37.38]Can you keep your mother waiting?
[18:39.01]She's scary when she's angry.
[18:41.83]Oh yeah, didn't she like chainsaw my hand off?
[18:45.78]Alright, Rose.
[18:46.46]Time for bed.
[18:52.14]We gonna get Ghostbusters 2'd here?
[19:01.94]Anybody that saw Ghostbusters 2?
[19:03.92]Like, are we... Is that gonna happen?
[19:05.16]I feel like that's gonna happen.
[19:05.96]I feel like that... Like... The guy, like... Oh, Vigo!
[19:09.88]Like, isn't he gonna come and, like, steal the... Look, if you haven't seen Ghostbusters 2, then fucking what's wrong with you?
[19:24.52]People in chat aren't old enough for that.
[19:27.82]I would rather you watch Ghostbusters 2 three times in a row than watch this stream right now.
[19:38.96]Watch out.
[19:39.28]I'm not going to say that because that's an actual spoiler.
[19:41.63]I just made a voice.
[19:44.45]Alright, it's time for dinner.
[19:51.49]Is she okay?
[19:52.87]Sleeping like a... Is that Mia?
[19:54.43]Like a baby.
[19:57.25]That smells good.
[19:58.17]What's that?
[19:58.80]Oh, hands off, mister.
[20:01.00]It's chuba de lagoon.
[20:02.66]It's a local recipe.
[20:03.56]Well, she went like... Wow, you've gone full native, haven't you?
[20:06.48]Like my health bar went down a little.
[20:07.78]Local wine, too.
[20:09.66]But if you're going to keep sulking all evening, maybe you shouldn't have any.
[20:13.39]What do we got here?
[20:15.81]You really have to stop worrying.
[20:19.32]Almost missed.
[20:20.54]No.
[20:20.68]The baby's gonna get Vigo'd.
[20:22.46]I've told you!
[20:23.58]Wait.
[20:23.70]What happened?
[20:48.12]Mia! Get down! Mia!
[20:49.20]What the fuck?
[20:53.37]Wait what?
[21:05.44]Who is doing this?
[21:06.44]Why would you do this?
[21:10.44]That was at every angle.
[21:12.44]Mia. Oh god.
[21:18.44]Chris?
[21:19.30]What the hell?
[21:20.46]Sorry, Ethan.
[21:22.62]No!
[21:23.95]No, no, you're supposed to be Whisker!
[21:26.59]Why?
[21:27.95]Go on, move!
[21:48.54]All clear.
[21:49.60]Rose?
[21:50.20]What the hell are you doing with my daughter?

[21:53.70]Package secured?
[21:55.30]Take him away.
[21:56.42]I said get your hands off her!
[21:58.10]Ethan, no.
[22:01.78]That kills people, by the way.
[22:05.21]I never understood why people continue to do that in TV shows.
[22:07.65]Get him out of here.
[22:13.75]I would be instantly dead if you did that right into the middle of my head.
[22:24.72]What is photo mode?
[22:25.70]Did I have like paused it at some point?
[22:29.36]Well, whatever.

[23:03.70]We hardly talk about anything else.
[23:07.22]I keep telling you, it's not Rose that I'm worried about.
[23:10.31]Well, then what are you worried about?
[23:11.87]Look, she's gonna be fine.
[23:14.57]I just know it.

[24:09.02]Oh, it's work.
[24:11.28]Shit, I gotta take this.
[24:12.96]About damn time.
[24:14.60]What's your status?

[24:17.18]What are you talking about?
[24:18.30]Where's Chris Redfield?
[24:20.61]And Rose?
[24:21.13]Who is this?
[24:29.47]Somebody just, like, fucking strangled that guy from behind.
[24:32.25]Like, squished his windpipe.
[24:35.19]Oh, no.
[24:35.41]That was where the edibles kicked in.
[24:39.21]What are you doing here?
[24:40.31]This is a secure... Oh, boy.
[24:43.17]Eliminate target.
[24:49.30]Recover body.
[24:49.94]Secure Rosemary Winters and Ethan Winters.
[24:52.18]Move the two Winterses...
[24:55.32]Move the two Winterses to Site C for further investigation.
[24:58.88]At least two transport officers do it.
[25:00.84]Why did they have to kill the girl?
[25:06.33]Any guns back here?
[25:13.21]I don't think so.
[25:13.65]Alright, let's go.
[25:21.70]Is this 90 FOV?
[25:27.53]Alright, alright, fine.
[25:28.57]I'll put them both in.
[25:31.39]Do I have, like, light-up shoes?
[25:57.23]Work is calling.
[25:58.69]Turn the light off.
[26:00.01]This is why I didn't want to start till later in the afternoon because it's fucking... It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon in Las Vegas.
[26:07.00]This is just sunny out right now.
[26:08.54]I'm telling you.
[26:09.30]This is why I wanted to start later.
[26:12.30]But that's not why I actually started later.
[26:15.72]I actually started later because my fans didn't work.
[26:18.82]Close the windows.
[26:19.88]The windows are closed.
[26:23.52]I don't have blackout curtains in my house.
[26:37.32]Ooh, you're gonna have to get a shot for that one Where the hell am I going?
[26:56.49]Oh shit
[27:01.91]Birds.
[27:02.23]A lot of dead birds everywhere.
[27:04.39]They're being hung up everywhere.
[27:05.91]Turn the light off.
[27:08.07]I can't turn the fucking light off.
[27:13.71]Alright, somebody tell me.
[27:14.35]Is this not EFOV?
[27:15.55]Before I, like, immerse myself in this game?
[27:17.33]Or do I have to do something?
[27:25.43]Is it?
[27:29.31]Okay, do your best.
[27:30.29]No, there's not a good fix for it.
[27:33.37]What?
[27:36.29]You need a mod.
[27:37.37]What the fuck are you talking about?
[27:39.29]What?
[27:42.60]It's 80.
[27:42.92]It's locked at 80.
[27:45.22]You have to hack the game.
[27:53.18]What the fuck are you talking about?
[27:56.47]That's not, that can't be real.
[28:02.13]How is that... How can there not be 90 FOV in a 1920x1080 game?
[28:08.87]Like, the ability to have it without it being a... That doesn't make any sense.
[28:16.76]Mod manager and FOV trainer.
[28:27.51]Don't restart that!
[28:28.67]I thought that said resume!
[28:35.42]Fuck Capcom!
[28:36.58]Fuck you, Capcom!
[28:37.92]Capcom sucks!
[28:39.36]That would've- I just ruined my game experience.
[28:41.52]That would've, like, scared me, and I would've been like, holy shit, that was so scary.
[28:45.20]Are you fucking kidding me?
[28:51.07]You've already ruined my game experience, because, like, wow, the FOV looks weird.
[28:53.87]Do we have to hack my video game to do something that should've, uh, that's been a normal thing since, like, 2012?
[29:04.18]How does it even happen?
[29:05.56]How does this even happen?
[29:07.36]How does this happen?
[29:10.04]Is everybody asleep?
[29:26.99]Meltdown percent.
[29:31.85]That would have been like a good scare too.
[29:45.15]I mean, boogers just almost came out of my nose.
[29:48.12]The first thing, if you're gonna have a game go on PC, I'm sorry.
[29:51.50]I have no fucking, I have absolutely no sympathy for any of this shit.
[29:55.76]If a game is gonna release on PC, and it's after 2008, if it's not 90 FOV, just throw the whole thing in the garbage and start over.
[30:07.22]Like, it should not even release.
[30:08.34]I can't even fucking believe it.
[30:09.96]Like, it's so simple.
[30:14.04]Did they just release this for console and just copy and paste the fucking code over here?
[30:18.14]Nobody cares about fucking PC gaming.
[30:20.16]Everyone thought this was going to... People thought like five years ago, man, PC gaming, people are going to start to care way more about this.
[30:26.52]Well, companies are starting to take PC gaming way more seriously.
[30:29.92]No, they don't give a fuck about this.
[30:47.90]BabyRage.
[30:48.56]It's true though!
[30:49.20]What the fuck?
[31:01.55]It's available in photo mode.
[31:05.09]I can't believe you have to hack your fucking game to do something that should be here from like 10 years ago.
[31:16.50]You're whining now.
[31:20.01]Yeah, I am.
[31:21.47]It's really fucking annoying.
[31:45.14]Oh, is this the big lady?
[31:49.99]It's already 90 FOV?
[31:51.37]It'd be so funny if it actually was.
[31:58.96]I hope it is so that I seem like a fucking psycho.
[32:04.42]I really don't think it is though.
[32:20.35]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[32:24.17]Can I pick this up?
[32:24.69]Out of the bed?
[32:40.73]Books?
[32:43.15]Oh, fuck.
[32:43.75]Okay, over here.
[32:49.26]I can't see anything though.
[32:52.52]Oh, don't make me go into the basement.
[32:53.80]I thought that was a sausage.
[33:08.01]It's a banana.
[33:29.15]Oh wait, I wasn't done.
[33:34.19]It's pretty creepy.
[33:43.41]What is that?
[33:52.06]There's something in there.
[33:53.14]Alright, I'm ready.
[33:55.12]I'm ready.
[33:56.66]Here it comes.
[33:57.24]One, two, three.
[33:58.14]It'ss gonna jump out.
[34:02.52]He's gonna be behind me.
[34:04.48]Can I grab the broom and just turn around?
[34:05.66]I thought right now I grab this broom and I turn around and just start swinging as hard as I can.
[34:11.06]If any, like, horror games and horror movies have taught me anything, it's that just grab this and just turn and swing as hard as you fucking can in a circle.
[34:24.80]Damn it.
[34:25.30]There's nothing here.
[34:25.92]Okay.
[34:26.12]I knew it.
[34:30.48]I fucking knew it.
[34:35.66]Is that a rat?
[34:40.31]Is that a rat doing that?
[34:41.49]Hey.
[34:41.63]Hey.
[35:25.87]Alright, give me a weapon.
[35:33.88]I need a weapon.
[35:34.38]I need a chair.
[35:34.98]I need a stick.
[35:35.92]I need like a rake or something.
[35:37.42]Give me a rake.
[35:37.88]There's gotta be something, right?
[35:48.93]Rake.
[35:56.99]Just run?
[35:59.87]Or a gun?
[36:00.33]Yeah, I mean, I was... I'll take a gun, but I'll take something, just a rake or something.
[36:07.12]Just to start.
[36:07.74]Wow.
[36:26.85]This looks really cool.
[36:27.69]Alright, I did- I may have said fuck Capcom earlier.
[36:33.47]I want to just correct that.
[36:34.39]Fuck Capcom.
[36:38.04]This particular instance.
[36:39.20]I love Resident Evil 2.
[36:40.00]It's like one of my favorite games the last five years.
[36:46.90]Ugh.
[37:00.78]I need to like get my emotions under control.
[37:02.94]I really am like Donald Duck.
[37:07.40]I connect so strongly with him.
[37:09.04]I don't know.
[37:09.36]I just like I get so just so frustrated.
[37:14.07]Oh, look at that poor miserable duck.
[37:17.05]I can't stand it.
[37:18.09]He starts eating plates and shit.
[37:34.08]Okay, there's like a staple.

[37:39.52]Is this the introduction to the- Is the big lady even like a- Is the big lady a bad character?

[39:19.20]Somebody's sleeping in that bed.
[39:45.77]Oh, it's that thing again.
[39:46.69]Alright, there's nothing in here.
[39:51.44]Tuber reactions.

[39:59.22]Why can't I pick it?
[39:59.78]Do I need a lockpick?

[40:11.51]Oh, shit.
[40:16.33]Tuber, you're talking like a tuber.
[40:21.07]Hey, this is just my normal speaking voice, man.
[40:23.20]What are you talking about?
[40:23.96]Is it because I'm playing a game that came out like a week ago?
[40:30.94]Is that why everybody's saying this?
[40:38.95]I mean, it looks great.
[40:40.31]It really does.
[40:42.79]Capcom.
[40:44.21]Just outdoing yourselves.
[40:45.59]Art direction, phenomenal.
[40:46.57]Graphics, unbelievable.

[41:07.68]Pick something.
[41:08.08]Pick up a weapon, man.
[41:10.56]One of these rocks will do.
[41:17.61]I didn't even play the game for five minutes and I already just said that.
[41:25.25]Don't worry, I'll patch it in three months.
[41:28.87]Locked due to missing homeowner.
[41:39.94]It's locked.
[41:41.12]It's got one of those things on it, okay.
[41:46.97]I believe this is where we need to go.
[41:59.22]Ah, there's a knife.
[41:59.98]Okay, finally a weapon.
[42:05.02]Knife.
[42:06.24]Attack.
[42:10.03]Is it like a block?
[42:13.55]What am I hitting?
[42:14.07]Am I stabbing myself in the stomach?
[42:18.83]You don't get a knife and then not fight something.
[42:32.70]Nothing.
[42:33.06]Okay.
[42:36.00]Here we go.
[42:43.46]Friendly.
[42:44.02]How did he miss?
[42:44.72]Who are you?
[42:46.20]Who sent you?
[42:47.02]How did you miss?
[42:48.06]There was an accident down the road.
[42:52.19]He shot me in point blank and missed.
[42:58.19]He looked like Ernest.
[43:00.60]One second.
[43:02.32]Oh, no.
[43:05.40]Well, give me yours.
[43:07.23]You can't seem to aim with it.
[43:09.41]Help.
[43:30.68]Dude, you stopped shooting the gun.
[43:33.24]Stop shooting your weapon.
[43:34.32]You have no idea what you're doing.
[43:35.90]This guy sucks.
[43:37.10]This guy sucks.
[43:41.14]Oh my god, that guy was awful.
[43:43.91]Can I get his gun?
[44:01.19]He did his best.
[44:05.31]Okay.
[44:14.68]I want to toggle.

[44:42.28]It has to be though, right?
[44:49.18]Two minute out.
[44:50.82]Aim.
[44:57.47]No, there's no toggle.
[45:01.86]Of course not.
[45:02.32]Why would there be a toggle?
[45:07.49]I like toggle.
[45:08.65]It's easier to do.
[45:09.91]Easier to use.
[45:10.35]I don't have to press down my middle finger.
[45:17.49]I know people think it's bad, but whatever.
[45:18.94]I like it.
[45:19.42]What the hell is wrong with this place?
[45:30.80]There's somebody there!
[45:33.96]Holy shit!
[45:36.14]This guy keeps losing his hand!
[45:43.23]Alright, let's shoot him!
[45:47.25]Shoot him!
[46:10.74]Space is guard?
[46:11.80]What?
[46:14.20]I could have just shot him in the head three times.
[46:21.63]These guys take a lot of shots.
[46:23.21]Oh my god.
[46:23.87]These are all headshots.
[46:28.49]Every single one of those is a headshot.
[46:29.83]Every single one.
[46:30.55]Holy shit, that's a lot of time to shoot.
[46:32.30]What the hell?
[46:39.85]Alright, so don't use weapons that often.
[46:42.19]Okay, one is.
[46:42.83]Okay, two.
[46:43.29]Do I have a flashlight?
[46:46.47]Why would I have a flashlight?
[46:47.47]What am I talking about?
[46:48.99]Chem fluid.
[46:49.53]Okay, view materials that can be crafted.
[46:54.72]Okay.
[46:57.34]First aid is chem fluid and herb.
[47:00.12]It looks like they got rid of anything besides green.
[47:03.10]Like just green herbs.
[47:05.98]The items, family photo, treasure.
[47:07.60]Okay, let's go.
[47:10.36]Everything gives you ammo.
[47:16.88]There it is.
[47:17.24]Alright, so herb.
[47:18.26]I don't think this... Looks like this... Just... Alright.
[47:21.97]Craft first aid.
[47:22.73]Excuse me.
[47:23.97]Get out of the way.
[47:24.51]First aid.
[47:26.31]Okay.
[47:29.43]Do it.
[47:31.79]I made a first aid kit.
[47:36.40]Okay.
[47:39.96]That...
[47:41.51]Do I have it?
[47:51.51]One in... Select the item to craft.
[47:54.54]Did I already do it?
[47:55.82]Okay.
[47:56.10]Am I losing my mind here?
[48:02.52]I've already made it.
[48:03.08]It wasn't really... It wasn't like a good indicator.
[48:08.20]I don't need to use it.
[48:16.43]Not pretending.
[48:16.97]Well, I just, I didn't see.
[48:18.19]Uh, I don't have a key to open this.
[48:21.97]This needs some kind of key.
[48:29.87]He sucks.
[48:30.94]I don't.
[48:31.48]Does this guy have anything on him?
[48:42.90]Wait, can I shoot this lock?
[48:44.52]Is it even a lock?
[48:47.17]No.
[48:53.89]There's gonna be another one of those guys.
[48:54.95]Alright, bolt cutters.
[48:57.37]Here we go.
[48:57.91]Yeah!
[48:58.59]Let's go.
[49:00.26]Don't let them bully you.
[49:01.20]Nobody's bullying me.
[49:05.54]I just played... Nobody's bullying me.
[49:07.24]I just played this game six days late.
[49:10.24]You already know where the bolt cutters are.
[49:12.24]I don't.
[49:25.06]Cool.
[49:37.01]I gotta... Okay, is ammo really a problem in this game like it is in every single one of these games?
[49:49.33]Yes.
[49:52.84]Oh, God.
[49:53.44]Somebody's gonna run down the stairs.
[49:56.41]Handgun ammo.
[49:57.32]Open inventory.
[49:57.80]Okay.
[49:59.04]Yes.
[50:02.04]I was just discarded.
[50:04.34]Okay.
[50:05.20]You have a huge inventory in this game.
[50:06.58]That's good.
[50:18.79]What?
[50:19.23]Okay.
[50:19.57]Okay.
[50:19.79]Do it.

[50:21.23]Please.
[50:22.01]What?
[50:38.43]Hey!
[50:41.47]It's just a scare.
[50:42.23]He can't get in here.
[50:42.87]Can I just get... I got chemicals.
[50:46.97]Hey!
[50:47.33]We can get in.
[50:47.77]He can get in.
[50:48.93]Can he get in here?

[51:01.06]Hey!
[51:01.54]Oh, fuck.
[51:02.44]Hey!
[51:04.00]What do I do?
[51:04.66]What am I supposed to do?
[51:05.32]What am I supposed to do?
[51:05.90]Go out here?
[51:07.02]What do I do?
[51:07.48]What do I do?
[51:08.25]What do I do?
[51:08.65]I don't know what to do.
[51:10.59]Can I jump?
[51:23.14]How do I get him off?
[51:52.28]What the hell?
[51:53.02]I was trying to put three in there?
[51:54.50]Is it over?
[51:59.14]He's taking three clips and I go, oh shit, which one?
[52:01.62]Oh, for the legs, not for the head?
[52:07.91]God damn it.
[52:09.51]I didn't mean to do that.
[52:10.31]My, my mouse is really sensitive.
[52:16.91]If there are any survivors out there, come to my, to Louisa's house.
[52:23.25]Big lady.
[52:24.05]It's the big lady.
[52:32.89]Go to the house near the field, okay?
[52:38.12]Those aren't any kind of standard zombie.
[52:40.66]Those things... Usually... Okay, every Resident Evil game has done this before.
[52:44.90]The first enemy you face is just a standard zombie.
[52:48.00]These guys are very, very quick.
[52:52.50]Okay, go to the big field.
[52:57.38]Where should I go over?
[52:58.58]Oh my god, okay.
[53:03.22]I don't think this is the right way.
[53:04.10]I wish I had a flashlight so I could see anything.
[53:16.04]First enemy in Resident Evil 7 is your wife.
[53:18.95]Yeah, but it's really, it's pretty scripted.
[53:23.37]Can't break this?
[53:37.56]Don't even.
[53:41.56]Wait, hold on.
[53:42.40]I gotta make another... How many items do I have?
[53:45.06]Okay.
[53:49.00]Got it.
[53:54.21]You missed the shotgun.
[53:55.67]Stop, stop, stop.
[53:56.83]This part sucks, Guillermo.
[53:58.09]What?
[53:58.57]What do you mean missed?
[54:00.03]Go to the old house.
[54:00.79]What are you talking about?
[54:11.26]What?
[54:11.38]Use the map.
[54:11.88]I didn't even know I had a map.
[54:19.51]Why would I have a map of this place?
[54:23.27]I just got like dumped here.
[54:28.54]You missed the shotgun.
[54:29.46]Go back.
[54:30.48]Did I really miss the shotgun?
[54:31.74]Why would they give you?
[54:32.34]No, I don't actually don't believe you guys.
[54:34.30]Why would you get a shotgun this early?
[54:38.82]I can't even leave.
[54:41.44]I'm stuck here.
[54:42.60]I can only go one way.
[54:53.79]Don't help him.
[54:55.47]I really don't think there's a shotgun.
[54:57.99]I think you're full of shit.
[55:07.57]Oh my god.
[55:11.10]What do you mean run?
[55:16.40]What?
[55:16.58]Oh my god, what did I do?
[55:18.04]What did I do?
[55:18.68]What happened to me?
[55:20.16]What did I do that for?
[55:20.88]I gotta run.
[55:25.50]Ammo, ammo, ammo, ammo, ammo.
[55:26.58]Alright, up, up, up, up, up.
[55:32.88]Survive the attack?
[55:34.42]Shotgun!
[55:35.16]Shotgun!
[55:36.57]Okay.
[55:43.87]What is that?
[55:44.19]Gunpowder.
[55:46.11]What's in here?
[55:47.89]Shotgun.
[55:50.61]What's in there?
[55:52.32]Shotgun bullets.
[55:57.73]Kick that down.
[55:58.51]Wait, what's that?
[55:59.21]What's that?
[55:59.55]Who is it?
[56:01.41]Gunpowder.
[56:02.37]Examine.
[56:02.91]It's full of flour.
[56:03.99]Oh, I can blow up... Why do I think I can blow up the flour by shooting it?
[56:06.99]Can I go down?
[56:16.38]There's no end to them.
[56:18.16]What?
[56:18.44]What's that?
[56:20.22]Rusted scrap?
[56:21.83]I don't want to miss any items.
[56:26.19]I don't know.
[56:34.86]Wait, I need to look at the map.
[56:37.88]It's right up here.
[56:39.38]Scrap metals for hats.

[60:43.94]No depth of field.
[60:44.75]Here we go.

[66:17.52]Rose, yes.
[66:20.35]She is in great danger.
[66:23.43]No.
[66:23.89]Since Mother Miranda brought her to the village, we have fallen into darkness.
[66:28.75]I'm trying to get like a...
[66:32.30]I want to get her going like this.
[66:34.29]And then make like a YouTuber thumbnail.
[66:54.47]Rose is here?
[66:55.97]I mean, I could have clearly just pointed the gun at this lady and been like, tell me what's going, tell me what you know.
[67:00.27]Like, I'm like, I have a gun.
[67:02.63]And like, you're like this weird witch person.
[67:04.44]Like, I will shoot you.

[67:32.20]You're a psycho.
[67:33.58]I'm the psycho.
[67:35.00]I just got literally attacked by all these people that were just trying to kill me and bite my hand off and shit.
[67:40.96]This is not a regular place.
[67:42.68]This is like, shit's going down here.
[67:44.26]People are killing you and eating you.
[67:47.81]What the fuck?
[67:48.35]I thought I just grabbed.
[67:49.21]It's Q. May they come to eat our flesh.
[67:54.41]May they come to tear us apart.
[67:55.47]Yeah, I'm going to read that.
[67:56.59]And then what?
[67:57.17]I'm not supposed to carry my gun?
[68:02.79]A guy with a sledgehammer just jumped from a ceiling, like 40-foot story, and was swinging it at me.
[68:17.70]An easy-to-pick lock.
[68:18.52]Shit.
[68:19.46]I want to get in there.
[68:28.29]I don't know what made me just think about this.
[68:29.69]I'm just going to say it because I don't know why I'm thinking it, but I was thinking it for some reason right now.
[68:35.03]Chewing gum is really gross.
[68:36.05]Chewing gum I hate the most.
[68:37.07]I don't know why that was... I don't know what that's from.
[68:39.32]It's from Willy Wonka?
[68:44.20]It's still something... Oh, it's because of the... I don't know why I had to say that, but I just did.
[68:56.12]Why V?
[68:57.70]It's M. Look for Rose.
[68:59.77]Okay, sure.
[69:00.49]We will.
[69:00.79]Can I move around?
[69:04.89]There we go.
[69:05.13]Alright, this is where I am.
[69:06.97]So, this door is locked.
[69:09.03]I didn't search this whole place, but let's just keep going.
[69:16.77]Vitamin B just kicked in.
[69:19.41]Oh, wait.
[69:20.21]No.
[69:22.41]Damn it.
[69:22.71]Okay, well, there's two of those.
[69:29.43]You never know what could be under the car.
[69:32.41]You're high on turmeric.
[69:33.59]Let's check.
[69:39.59]Can't open this door.
[69:40.26]Can I even go in here?
[69:41.28]No.
[69:44.48]Do you have a front door?
[69:45.38]What about this thing?
[69:48.20]Ever?
[69:48.40]Okay.
[69:53.34]I just want to make sure I don't miss anything.
[69:54.64]I'm trying to complete the game.
[69:56.31]Castle Dimitri Sioux.
[70:00.27]Well, that's where the big lady is.
[70:04.19]I know that's what the character's name is.
[70:13.24]Walk from the other side.
[70:14.06]Alright.
[70:14.40]Alright.
[70:14.66]Let's just go.
[70:15.16]Let's just go get the introduction.
[70:16.20]We're going to get, like, an interesting, like, violin, like, piano mix.
[70:22.83]She's going to waltz in, like, oh, hello.
[70:24.73]It's going to be, like...
[70:31.00]It's going to be like a violin and shit.
[70:32.26]It's going to be cool.
[70:32.92]I can't wait.
[70:36.66]Oh, darling.
[70:37.72]I bet she says darling at least two or three times.
[70:39.78]I guess this leads to the castle.
[70:48.20]I need to find that thing and that thing.
[70:53.20]There's two circle depressions there.
[71:08.99]What is that?
[71:10.49]Ooh, there's one of them.
[71:17.44]Ooh, what the hell?
[71:20.40]Oh, type right up.
[71:22.94]Good thing my game didn't like crash.
[71:29.95]Something's still in here.
[71:32.81]What is still in here?
[71:33.71]Ooh.
[71:35.11]Ooh.
[71:36.49]Should disaster fall upon the village, seek out the crests.
[71:39.05]One is in the care of the church, the other is at Louisa's house.
[71:43.24]Okay, Louisa's house.
[71:46.14]Got it.
[71:52.50]So Louisa's house is down here.
[71:57.54]Is that Louisa's house?
[71:59.81]Which one of these is Louisa's house?
[72:00.95]Probably this one or that one.
[72:02.11]This one right here.
[72:03.33]So we need to go that way.
[72:07.38]Go back.
[72:09.62]It's not fully explored?
[72:10.70]Shit.
[72:13.39]What did I miss?
[72:13.87]How is this not fully explored?
[72:23.94]Really?
[72:26.26]Look up.
[72:36.77]Crystal fragment.
[72:39.45]Treasure.
[72:39.97]Whoa, I got a treasure?
[72:44.33]White mineral found in this region.
[72:46.43]Could probably sell it.
[72:47.37]Valuable.
[72:48.47]Oh, shit.
[72:49.07]That's cool.
[72:51.47]Now, ah!
[72:52.21]Alright, good, good.

[73:00.54]Yeah, so I have to go to this place.
[73:05.81]This place has keys and shit.
[73:06.98]Alright.
[73:07.40]Let me go over there.
[73:10.76]Making money.
[73:11.26]What?
[73:17.57]Explore everything.
[73:18.31]I don't want to miss anything, guys.
[73:19.63]Another one of these wells that I can't use.
[73:23.13]Stop helping him.
[73:26.19]I want him to lose.
[73:29.85]See how many headshots I got in a row?
[73:31.79]And by the way, that first part I've heard was very difficult.
[73:35.47]I only had to use one healing potion.
[73:37.98]Okay.
[73:48.32]Do I have any bullets in this shotgun?
[73:51.98]No, I don't.
[73:53.32]I've got to be smart about this.
[74:00.49]Oh my god, they're running through, what is this, corn or wheat?
[74:03.81]What is this?
[74:07.11]Oh god, he's right there.
[74:08.31]Can I jump over this?
[74:10.31]Alright, is it like blinding?
[74:14.68]I think the flower blinds them.
[74:20.28]If I would take a wild guess.
[74:24.06]Here we go, alright, reload this shit right now.
[74:41.82]How many arms do I have?
[74:47.64]Craft some ammo.
[74:52.24]Ammo.
[74:53.00]Gunpowder and rusted scrap.
[74:54.92]Did I waste that?
[74:59.52]Did I waste it?
[75:06.44]Shit.
[75:06.80]Well, whatever.
[75:08.57]I'm going.
[75:12.15]Can't jump over this?
[75:12.83]Why?
[75:18.03]How do you not jump over that?
[75:19.46]I don't... How are you... That... Can't jump over that?
[75:30.75]Okay, here we go.
[75:33.97]Ouch.
[75:44.86]My foot!
[75:52.73]Slap him!
[76:17.69]I hate when they do that move.
[76:25.87]Can I step on his head?
[76:33.50]Yeah, I'm getting too close.
[76:36.42]You think so?
[76:43.17]Ammo.
[76:43.85]Make it.
[76:45.26]Okay, good.
[76:48.74]So much ammo.
[76:49.64]Just use the one.
[76:52.82]Okay, I want to go this way.
[76:59.86]He thinks he's playing Resident Evil 4.
[77:01.34]Do I?
[77:01.68]I got two heals.
[77:14.24]No, I'm not gonna heal.
[77:15.33]Why would I heal right now?
[77:19.25]I feel like there's something in the middle of that field.
[77:20.75]Yeah.
[77:27.79]He's eating something.
[77:28.45]What is he eating?
[77:29.25]Should I just kill him?
[77:31.51]Will he notice me if I don't do anything weird?
[77:48.77]Don't hurt us.
[77:49.97]Whoa.
[77:50.63]What?
[77:51.09]It's okay.
[77:52.21]I'm not gonna hurt you.
[77:53.85]I'm just glad to see normal people at last.
[77:56.37]Have you seen any other survivors?
[77:58.73]No.
[78:00.09]They're all in Louise's house.
[78:02.03]And she's not answering and the gate is locked.
[78:04.40]Quiet, girl.
[78:06.08]He's an outsider.
[78:07.38]Oh.
[78:14.40]Shit, we're sending ducks in here.
[78:15.78]Can your old man walk?
[78:18.05]You're talking so loud.
[78:19.71]You're gonna kill us.
[78:20.43]When the outsider is sus.
[78:21.57]My eyes just rolled back in my head and I think I caused permanent damage to them.
[78:24.79]Can I have that?
[78:25.29]I'll trade you a knife for that.
[78:49.90]Okay.
[78:50.50]They're all in Louise's house.
[78:54.00]It's down here.
[78:56.92]I don't know.
[79:04.32]Good.
[79:04.62]Ammo.
[79:04.88]I need it.
[79:11.15]What is that?
[79:12.77]Oh, gunpowder.
[79:13.83]Nice.
[79:14.25]Alright.
[79:15.71]On the roof.
[79:16.05]Can you go on the roof?
[79:19.79]When are we going to see the big sus lady?
[79:21.55]I don't know.
[79:21.97]Oh, this is Louise's house.
[79:29.27]Let's go.
[79:29.59]And...
[79:46.62]No?
[79:48.06]Out of... One of the crests is in there.
[79:49.73]Could probably open it... What?
[79:51.09]Could probably open it by removing a screw.
[79:53.75]Okay, I need like... I need a screwdriver.
[79:55.09]There's definitely a screwdriver in this house.
[80:00.87]By the way, how does it look with the 3090?
[80:02.05]Did you get those two inside?
[80:11.84]Looks like shit.
[80:12.54]Looks like total dog shit.
[80:27.45]You have an RTX on?
[80:33.57]No, because I'm afraid of overheating it.
[80:35.82]Because one of my fans in front of the case doesn't work.
[80:37.92]I'm sorry.
[80:41.38]We'll be safe in here, won't we?
[80:44.36]Safer here than out there, that's for sure.
[80:45.92]Hey, do you know anything about what's going on around here?
[80:51.79]It doesn't make any sense.
[80:53.75]Mother Miranda has always protected us.
[80:56.07]Nobody's answer.
[81:01.08]Father?
[81:04.70]We have to get inside.
[81:10.13]Audio cut off.
[81:12.77]Just hold on a bit longer, Papa.
[81:15.31]The audio cut off.
[81:17.18]Alright, we have to get inside.
[81:22.08]Hello?
[81:24.52]Anybody home?
[81:26.69]Maybe a familiar voice.
[81:28.95]Louisa!
[81:30.01]Open up!
[81:30.41]It's me, Elena!
[81:34.65]Stop shouting.
[81:36.32]You'll draw the monsters.
[81:37.50]I thought it was the same guy.
[81:39.18]A friend.
[81:39.94]Stay back.
[81:41.48]Father.
[81:41.86]I thought it was the shotgun guy.
[81:43.86]Let us in.
[81:44.82]No, they'll smell the blood.
[81:45.62]You'll endanger us all.
[81:46.84]My father will die.
[81:47.88]And no sudden movements.
[81:49.01]I learned how to aim from my father.
[81:52.51]Hold earnest.
[81:54.01]Come now.
[81:54.83]I would just run at him if I heard that.
[81:56.77]Go on.
[81:57.23]Go inside.
[81:58.57]Come now.
[81:59.45]This way.
[82:02.42]You're not from this village.
[82:04.56]Uh, no.
[82:06.56]I'm Ethan.
[82:07.98]Julian, go make yourself useful and check the grounds.
[82:11.70]I said go!
[82:17.57]Well, if Elena trusts you, then so do I. Come inside, Ethan.
[82:29.54]Where's the huge lady?
[82:30.82]I'll check on the others.
[82:37.11]They're going to eat me.
[82:42.51]They've broken again.
[82:43.19]Got more of the livestock.
[82:44.19]I don't think we'll make it through winter at this rate.
[82:46.31]Ernest is still... Your guys' name is Ernest?
[82:55.86]Ernest is still missing too.
[82:56.96]We can't find him anywhere.
[82:58.46]Has Mother Miranda abandoned us?
[83:04.30]Are you kidding me?
[83:07.24]okay whatever did it tell me that before and I just no I don't think so rotate your saves yeah I will hold on let me look at this can I get a closer look oh whatever these nice photos whatever I don't care
[83:37.78]Right this way.
[83:46.29]Who are the presidents?
[83:49.69]Two presidents on the wall.
[83:53.11]Come inside.
[83:53.71]The others are waiting.
[83:57.69]What the fuck is this?
[83:59.26]Outsiders, you're gonna get us all killed.
[84:00.96]Right, Anton.
[84:02.70]He helped Leonardo and Elena.
[84:04.52]We were doing fine by ourselves.
[84:06.96]Please, Ethan, take a seat.
[84:09.78]Emergency meeting.
[84:11.70]Right in the front of that table.
[84:12.99]I don't like that guy.
[84:16.73]All that's left?
[84:18.63]There is no one left!
[84:21.62]worthless, invalid, a stupid, wailing bitch!
[84:27.90]And you!
[84:29.36]You drag a bloody man and an outsider in here like it's nothing?
[84:33.35]And expect to be all safe?
[84:35.03]There is no safe!
[84:39.31]Every sorry bastard out there has been ripped in half.
[84:43.42]But tomorrow?
[84:48.92]Tomorrow we'll all be dead.
[84:52.56]Just like her damn husband.
[84:54.78]Put a sock in it, Roxanna!
[84:56.22]That's enough!
[84:57.74]This house has protected my family for generations.
[85:01.80]And drunk or not, you are all welcome and safe in here.
[85:07.97]Whatever.
[85:10.63]Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on here?
[85:13.63]We don't know.
[85:15.38]One day we were a quiet, devout village, and the next, the monsters came and attacked us.
[85:23.19]And they... They kept coming.
[85:25.27]Wait, Louisa.
[85:27.03]Where is your husband?
[85:29.45]Did they... No.
[85:31.71]No, he is out there.
[85:34.57]Somewhere.
[85:36.84]He went to get help.
[85:39.16]Yes, yes, that's... I feel like this is an elaborate escape room that I paid a bunch of money to do.
[85:44.46]Let us pray.
[85:46.44]For him.
[85:47.76]For all of us.
[85:49.36]Good idea.
[85:52.99]Someone's gonna start flicking the lights.
[86:03.52]Hear our voice together as one in reverence.
[86:08.24]We call on thee within the endless dark to deliver us into fate's hands.
[86:15.48]As the midnight moon rises on black wings,
[86:19.47]So we make our sacrifice and bring the light at the end.
[86:25.25]In life and in death, we give you glory, Mother Miranda.
[86:34.91]Now, the tea should be ready.
[86:37.31]Come help me, Elena, please.
[86:38.95]I've heard it before.
[86:39.53]There was an old woman near the graveyard.
[86:40.51]Give me the hag.
[86:48.96]Some bitch is crazy as a bag of rats.
[86:52.18]There is wisdom in her devotion, though.
[86:55.72]And I hope it protected her, as it shall protect us.
[87:05.61]I'm sorry.
[87:19.21]The fucking monster is gonna come out of him.
[87:21.39]So I was trying to time the photo.
[87:26.99]I'm sorry, whatever.
[87:28.11]Oh, I got it!
[87:29.71]How do I move the camera?
[88:12.79]okay filters oh wow that's scary I don't like any of these yellow this looks like a loading screen for this game

[88:50.18]Okay.
[88:51.16]Alright, that looks good.
[88:54.06]Why can I not change the camera shit?
[88:56.00]Adjust the scope of the camera.
[88:57.30]What's going on here?
[88:58.00]Okay.
[89:01.68]Now, control, hide HUD.
[89:07.50]F. Photo.
[89:09.82]It's because it's a cutscene.
[89:10.90]Oh, okay.

[90:07.48]Fuck!
[90:09.84]Alright, I have to stop doing this.
[90:11.40]Why did you tell me I could do this?
[90:13.22]I know.
[90:13.54]I'm done.
[90:14.00]I'm not doing it anymore.
[90:14.82]No more.
[90:15.30]I'm done.
[90:15.76]I'm not doing this ever again.
[90:17.64]I promise I'm not gonna do it again.
[90:19.72]Ever again.
[90:20.62]I swear to God.
[90:22.26]I promise.
[90:22.84]I'm not gonna do it again.
[90:23.84]I'm done.
[90:24.42]It's over.
[90:24.76]Don't even do it.
[90:26.93]I wanted the shotgun shooting him in the face.
[90:29.39]Elena?
[90:33.09]I said no!
[90:35.01]Yeah, I didn't do it, see?
[90:37.27]Oh my god.
[90:40.95]I'm so sorry, father.
[90:42.07]Hey.
[90:43.49]Hey.
[90:44.19]That wasn't your father anymore.
[90:45.93]You did the right thing.
[90:46.81]Elena.
[90:50.23]Elena, no.
[90:51.79]So is he infected?
[90:52.61]I don't get it.
[90:53.03]There's nothing you can do.
[90:56.22]Escape.
[90:56.36]Alright, this is where the escape room happens.
[91:24.89]Oh my god.
[91:25.39]This is so scary.
[91:28.81]Whoa, what's that?
[91:30.77]Hey, hey!
[91:32.09]There's a five?
[91:33.46]There's a five written on the ceiling.
[91:35.96]Write that down.
[91:39.04]Under the car.
[91:42.82]I got a seven over here on the tire.
[91:46.81]Maybe there's a padlock.
[91:53.31]Oh, wait, this is the house that was from the beginning of the game.
[92:08.47]Whoa, that's a lot of money.
[92:11.31]I'll take 500 bucks.
[92:12.31]Why not?
[92:13.31]Take the screwdriver out of the key ring if you need it.
[92:16.41]I'm really, you know, this company, this escape room company, they leave little helpful clues.
[92:28.22]Truck key.
[92:32.99]Examine items.
[92:34.07]Examine... What is that?
[92:42.37]Damn it.
[92:42.71]I was so hoping, like, a four was going to be written on this key for some reason.
[92:47.00]Oh, well.
[92:58.99]Okay, I got the screwdriver.
[92:59.89]What else have we got here?
[93:03.53]Shotgun ammo.
[93:04.33]Let me make sure it's loaded.
[93:05.19]One, two.
[93:07.51]Good.
[93:15.21]This has been explored.
[93:16.08]Let's check this side.
[93:19.08]Cool.
[93:23.10]Oh, I'm not going up there yet.
[93:24.00]I think there's something in here.
[93:24.90]Yeah, there's something in here.
[93:27.95]Something?
[93:28.29]There's fire in here.
[93:30.35]But wait a minute.
[93:30.77]What about here?
[93:31.17]Come on.
[93:37.94]There's got to be like one of those shining things, right?
[93:40.50]A jewel?
[93:57.11]That's a jewel right there, isn't it?
[93:58.19]Isn't that a jewel?
[94:06.64]Shit.
[94:10.04]Where is this?
[94:11.34]There's something in here.
[94:12.14]Oh, here we go.
[94:17.70]If we could just get through this wall.
[94:19.10]No.
[94:20.36]No, I can't.
[94:21.00]Whatever.
[94:22.12]If I...
[94:25.97]If I can't, whatever.
[94:26.55]The fire's moving fast.
[94:29.71]Potted plant.
[94:39.76]Got it.
[94:40.30]Nice.
[94:43.26]Oh shit, we're like fucking dying.
[94:44.74]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[94:46.44]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[94:47.44]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, go, go, get in.
[95:03.42]Stop reading chat?
[95:04.44]No.
[95:04.62]Hit the gas.
[95:05.60]That didn't work.
[95:39.56]Are we driving up the stairs?
[95:42.94]Did I think this was a Bugs Bunny cartoon?
[95:46.19]What the fuck am I doing?
[95:48.83]Wait, what?
[95:49.51]A car?
[96:04.22]You know the craziest thing?
[96:05.06]We probably could have used this car.
[96:07.05]Or something.
[96:07.47]Alright.
[96:07.75]Move.
[96:08.03]Move.
[96:10.33]Move.
[96:10.47]Help me move this.
[96:31.98]There that's our way out Window hey don't talk like that We'll find a safe house to put you in until I could find my daughter my hunch is she's in that old castle No
[96:57.80]The place is full of nothing but blood and death.
[97:00.86]And I don't want to be alone while you're... Father?
[97:06.12]Elena, no.
[97:07.20]That's not him.
[97:08.16]Not anymore.
[97:08.68]Don't press P. He said my name.
[97:12.58]Father!
[97:13.00]Wait, it's not safe!
[97:16.74]I was hoping he was going to do the thing with the stuntman.
[97:19.32]Wait.
[97:19.68]Stay there!
[97:23.64]Come on.
[97:24.47]Give me your hand.
[97:29.98]Don't hit P. Don't hit P. I'm gonna hit P. I'm gonna hit P. I'm gonna... I'm gonna rip P off the keyboard.
[97:53.01]I'm gonna rip P off the keyboard, I think.
[97:55.17]I won't stop.
[97:56.75]This is just too much.
[97:58.80]I have to take pee off the keyboard, I think.
[98:02.25]I'm so annoyed with myself that I'm doing that.
[98:04.45]No more.
[98:04.87]Don't do that shit anymore.
[98:05.71]It's not fucking funny.
[98:07.09]Don't do that anymore.
[98:07.81]You don't fucking do that anymore, alright?
[98:09.83]Alright, alright.
[98:10.31]Don't fucking do it anymore.
[98:14.02]I just... I don't get it.
[98:15.56]Let's go.
[98:26.07]Jump.
[98:29.60]This place is going mad.
[98:33.31]Why the fuck is this happening again?
[98:35.51]What the fuck?
[98:37.59]Shit.
[98:40.69]That would have been awesome if that cratered with his fist and the wood bent and broke and made an explosion sound.
[98:46.50]He figured out that he had fucking powers.
[98:50.56]Capcom, what have you done?
[99:06.72]Hey.
[99:08.18]Alright, I gotta get the thing out of here.
[99:13.34]Use the screwdriver.
[99:14.34]I'm really low on health.
[99:16.68]I need a save point, too.
[99:17.66]This is not... This is kind of getting ugly.
[99:19.16]Okay.
[99:27.11]Let's go in the castle.
[99:35.48]When I used to play like PUBG on my mobile device, you would hear that and you'd just be like, where is this guy?
[99:43.13]He's fucking like 500 miles away.
[99:46.39]And I would stand still.
[99:50.11]And he would still miss.
[99:52.31]And that's how I knew if he was shooting at me, right?
[99:56.36]I didn't even care if I lost or died.
[99:58.14]If I was standing still and I didn't get hit, then he was aiming at somebody else.
[100:06.02]And he doesn't even potentially even see me.
[100:07.81]Pills.
[100:08.35]Anything else I missed?
[100:12.09]I have explored pretty much everything.
[100:35.17]follow the plot no that okay I thought that was telling me like to go this way because the plot is that way to like keep the story going these guys are all dead right I need a typewriter
[101:11.09]Is that it?
[101:13.57]Is there anything else?
[101:39.84]This is just a MOBA character select screen.
[101:44.16]That's the one line and then she's sitting there doing her little animation.
[101:52.47]And like the fucking stadium is screaming because they can't believe that.
[101:55.91]Like, wow.
[101:58.28]What a counter pick.
[101:59.94]This is a low tier character.
[102:01.42]I'm getting too out of control here.
[102:12.37]Oh, that's wrong.
[102:17.01]Wait, where is this?
[102:18.36]Oh, out here.
[102:22.34]Death.
[102:23.18]Death!
[102:24.68]Death!
[102:28.14]Death!
[102:29.66]Death.
[102:37.00]Hey, get in there.
[102:38.51]Set.
[102:44.29]There's a Jerma behind you.
[102:45.99]What?
[102:47.41]Oh, it's Otto.
[102:49.76]What's the matter?
[102:50.26]Do you need something, Otto?
[102:51.98]What is it?
[102:55.78]Otto?
[102:57.92]What is it?
[102:58.24]Do you see his tail?
[103:01.21]What is it?
[103:03.73]What is it?
[103:06.51]Hey, come over here.
[103:07.57]They can't see you.
[103:09.25]Hold on, let me just make sure I have pants on.
[103:21.33]Wanna get out?
[103:23.41]He doesn't even wanna be- He wants to leave.
[103:30.47]Okay.
[103:34.77]Dude, and when he's running out, he was like, fuck Capcom.
[103:37.11]I was like, well, holy shit, dude.
[103:38.47]What happened?
[103:41.15]Why did he even say that?
[103:43.24]What was that for?
[103:47.24]It was kind of rude.
[103:48.42]It's like they make good games and shit.
[103:54.39]Alright, let me in.
[103:55.21]Here we go.
[103:55.61]We're gonna meet Lady of the Castle.
[104:02.42]Can't wait for the... And she's probably gonna go like this.
[104:09.51]And, like, cool herself off with it, right?
[104:26.39]What's this cord?
[104:28.75]This cord's going... Is that electricity?
[104:32.05]Am I gonna get zapped?
[104:36.60]Come on.
[104:36.92]There's something under here, right?
[104:39.26]Why would they have this?
[104:44.14]Are we for later?
[104:44.70]I hear something in the water!
[104:49.81]What's in the water?
[104:50.55]I just heard that.
[104:56.25]What is that for?
[104:57.06]A rope?
[105:04.54]It was you?
[105:05.10]It didn't sound like me.
[105:06.38]Whoa.
[105:12.85]You guys can't see how much ammo I have.
[105:17.43]Right.
[105:17.65]Does it matter?
[105:19.23]Lower left?
[105:20.25]Lower left?
[105:37.89]Because now you can actually see how much ammo I have.
[105:41.11]Save the game?
[105:41.69]I mean, there's nowhere I can save right now.
[105:47.54]What is in the middle?
[105:49.78]Looks weird.
[105:50.40]Top right?
[105:52.10]I don't like top right.
[105:59.22]Flipped it.
[105:59.62]Yeah, well, because now if I'm looking that way, that would be weird.
[106:04.09]I don't want to be looking this way because I need to be looking at the game.
[106:11.48]Does it look weird?
[106:12.24]Turn it back, please.
[106:24.85]I think this is alright.
[106:25.63]Wait, that does look kind of weird, doesn't it?
[106:26.87]Top right doesn't feel right to me, though.
[106:32.90]It always feels weird.
[106:37.44]Right?
[106:40.73]No, I hate that.
[106:43.15]I actually hate that.
[106:43.97]I could go, like, here.
[106:46.61]Where's the, where's it come up?
[106:49.55]That's fine.
[106:51.41]I'm not, I don't hate that.
[106:52.41]Alright, that's okay.
[106:58.30]There's nothing wrong with that, but that kind of... Then you don't get to see, like, kind of this side of the screen, though.
[107:03.90]Whatever.
[107:10.87]Well, well.
[107:14.67]Didn't think anyone was left.
[107:17.27]You must be pretty tough.
[107:20.03]Huh.
[107:21.71]Who the fuck are you?
[107:24.02]Oh, you're not local.
[107:27.30]Even better.
[107:34.14]Mother Miranda's gonna love you.
[107:41.04]Guys can tell he sounds like Elvis.
[107:45.10]Oh, Mother Miranda's gonna love you, uh-huh.
[107:49.00]Oh, what have you brought me?
[108:08.20]He's going to walk in.
[108:09.62]Oh, what have you brought me, darling?
[108:12.42]The man is of no real use to anyone else.
[108:14.97]And my daughters do so entertaining for us.
[108:19.65]Furthermore, I can assure you that you trust the mortal to have still trust.
[108:23.51]My daughters and I will deliver to you... Get out of the way, ugly!
[108:27.43]If I want to see!
[108:29.70]He's awake!
[108:30.62]Both of you shut the fuck up!
[108:36.15]You mean you'll screw around with him in private, and where's the fun in that?
[108:39.61]Give him to me, and I'll put on a show that everybody can enjoy.
[108:43.13]Ugh, so gauche.
[108:45.09]What do we care for bread and circuses?
[108:47.61]The man-thing's suffering is assured.
[108:49.91]Gag, gag, as a man's dick is cut off in the castle, blah, blah, blah.
[108:55.23]What the fuck is going on?
[108:56.95]I've heard all your arguments.
[108:59.05]Some of you were less persuasive than others, but I've made my decision.
[109:05.31]Heisenberg, the man's fate is in your hands.
[109:09.25]Mother Miranda, I must protest.
[109:11.89]Heisenberg is but a child, and his devotion to you is questionable.
[109:16.92]Give the mortal to me, and I will ensure he is ready.
[109:20.90]Set her down, and don't be a sore loser.
[109:24.99]You'll find her food somewhere else.
[109:26.71]Quiet now, child.
[109:28.67]Why are they Avengers?
[109:29.69]They're like the evil Avengers.
[109:31.43]You're the one who's arguing with Miranda's decision.
[109:33.48]You wouldn't know responsibility if it was welded together.
[109:36.08]Oh, keep glory.
[109:37.02]One day your head might actually fit your ego.
[109:38.88]Fight, fight, fight, fight.
[109:40.38]Hey, don't I get a say in this?
[109:41.80]Silence!
[109:43.94]My decision is final.
[109:46.05]There will be no argument.
[109:48.83]Remember from whence you came.
[109:51.49]Dang.
[109:53.75]Huh.
[109:55.64]Lycans and gentlemen, we thank you for winning.
[110:01.48]And now let the games begin.
[110:05.84]Let's see what you have there, Ethan Hunter.
[110:12.40]Get ready.
[110:13.78]Get ready.
[110:16.66]You missed.
[110:17.16]Ten.
[110:19.72]Nine.
[110:20.64]Eight.
[110:22.52]Seven.
[110:24.36]Six.
[110:26.18]I didn't need any water.
[110:27.96]I just needed water.
[110:29.28]Can I have one sip of water?
[110:30.32]Alright.
[110:32.08]This is a game.
[110:40.92]It's a game to them.
[110:43.88]It's a game.
[110:45.18]Whoa.
[110:55.96]It's a fucking game!
[110:57.14]Why do I keep- Duck!
[111:10.49]Oh shit, I didn't duck.
[111:14.08]It's a game show?
[111:23.81]Joel already made that joke?
[111:26.54]FUCK!
[111:26.74]I should've played this a week ago!
[111:54.96]What do I do?
[111:55.28]What do I do?
[111:57.26]What do I do?
[111:59.86]What do I do?
[112:00.42]What do I do?
[112:01.18]What do I do?
[112:02.62]What do I do?
[112:07.17]Shit!
[112:12.15]My word.
[112:13.73]You truly are as strong as they say.
[112:16.58]Who said?
[112:17.12]Who said that?
[112:18.18]Open.
[112:19.00]Open!
[112:19.38]Break it!
[112:19.66]Break it!
[112:20.18]What happened?
[112:20.80]What just happened?
[112:22.24]What?
[112:54.02]I was trying to break the box.
[112:55.34]I couldn't break it.
[112:56.36]Break, break.
[112:57.18]No, wrong way.
[112:58.14]Oh, I just, I can't even.
[113:02.55]Wait.
[113:03.27]Oh, no, never mind.
[113:04.35]Oh.
[113:12.43]I was about to do it like a bit, but I cut it off.
[113:17.57]This is so loud.
[113:18.61]I gotta turn this down.
[113:19.51]Oh my god.
[113:20.97]It's like I'm talking way louder than I normally would be.
[113:23.75]Sorry.
[113:25.33]Alright.
[113:43.61]Building all this bullshit.
[113:52.00]Alright, so I can't break that shit.
[113:54.76]Crouch!
[113:56.26]Okay, wait a minute.
[114:03.90]So what's going on here?
[114:07.30]I can't break those, so I just have to run.
[114:08.78]I don't think I can break them.
[114:17.15]Does it go this far?
[114:19.17]Whoa.
[114:19.39]Chill.
[114:49.46]Wait, do those freaks have rows?
[114:55.04]300 bucks.
[114:58.36]Handgun ammo.
[114:59.50]I have had my weapons, too.
[115:00.64]Were you telling me I couldn't pick that up?
[115:02.46]No, I couldn't have.
[115:03.08]Never mind.
[115:04.72]I could have shot the handgun, though.
[115:05.78]Are you telling me I couldn't have shot the handgun?
[115:09.80]Is that going to move?
[115:21.41]That's gonna move.
[115:22.03]Alright, go.
[115:23.35]Oh my god.
[115:24.13]Oh, this is... Oh my goodness gracious.
[115:25.97]Okay.
[115:28.31]It's not gonna drop.
[115:29.13]It's gonna drop.
[115:33.05]God.
[115:39.29]I made it.
[115:39.67]Alright.
[115:45.06]Oh, is he communicating with me, by the way?
[115:46.92]I'm confused about that.
[115:56.53]The speaker?
[115:57.21]This is just a saw game.
[116:07.35]I mean, it kind of is.
[116:09.45]It's good.
[116:10.64]So far, I like it.
[116:13.60]Don't take the first five minutes of this game what I said.
[116:16.02]Just to learn if I like this game.
[116:22.80]Big burps.
[116:25.25]Alright, so now we just gotta go back in there and just, wait, go back to where we just were?
[116:28.97]I can just go there and, like, wipe the sweat off my brow and be like, alright, I did it.
[116:39.57]Gotta be something over here, right?
[116:43.39]Yep.
[116:49.79]He's gonna have a stopwatch.
[116:50.93]He's gonna be like, there you are, record time.
[116:55.62]Something like that, right?
[116:56.46]That was like a test.
[116:58.28]See if I'm worthy to be the next Avenger.
[117:04.85]I've been waiting for you, Mr. Winters.
[117:08.89]How do you know my name?
[117:10.55]Anyone who knows anyone has heard of the likes of you.
[117:14.55]A hero searching for his daughter.
[117:18.13]Though I must say, that castle arouses suspicion.
[117:22.36]Are these all fairytale characters?
[117:24.06]This is like Humpty Dumpty.
[117:25.65]This is fairytale characters, right?
[117:26.69]Holy shit.

[123:19.49]I'm going to have to turn that on later.
[123:20.61]Alright, let's keep going.
[123:23.47]It's like an elevator room.
[123:28.46]They say it in the game.
[123:30.04]They do?
[123:30.32]You're a liar.
[123:34.40]I guarantee they don't say Dimitrisu one time in the whole game.
[123:41.59]I bet you one wink that they don't.
[123:51.93]Remember I don't think they say like I could say it and like other characters But I'm talking about like the Dimitri sue family is not gonna say Dimitri sue the whole game Like I'm lady Dimitri sue no Alright, that's good handgun ammo either that was weird I
[124:25.48]They literally said it.
[124:26.32]No, but for us again.

[125:41.74]You are so kind to me, daughters.
[125:47.47]Now, let's take a look at him.
[125:51.09]Wow.
[125:51.91]Well, Ethan Winters.
[125:54.45]You escaped my little brother's idiot games, did you?
[125:58.85]Let's see how special you are.
[126:00.55]No, I don't want to play any more games.
[126:02.63]Yes, mother.
[126:03.19]Yes, mother.
[126:07.20]Look, can you just get out?
[126:08.20]Can we talk?
[126:09.00]Like, why do I have to play games?
[126:11.20]What the fuck?
[126:20.39]Do vampires have like a blood filter like we filter water?
[126:23.91]Wouldn't that just be the equivalent of like drinking out of the sewer?
[126:49.83]Oh, be careful what you wish for, Ethan Winters.
[126:54.25]I don't know.
[126:55.03]I feel like that's dirty.
[126:55.87]You need like a vampire Britta.
[126:58.31]What are you doing?
[127:11.80]What the fuck was that?
[127:12.78]What was that?
[127:14.22]What was that thing?
[127:15.32]What was she smelling?
[127:16.97]What was... What did she just... What the fuck was that?
[127:20.53]Alright, so if I sit here for 15 minutes... I don't do anything.
[127:38.52]The main character bad guy from Fall...
[127:42.40]Fall out?
[127:44.10]Fall Guys?
[127:44.96]What's the game?
[127:46.30]I've ruined the joke already.
[127:48.40]Fall... What's the name of the fucking game?
[127:50.72]Far Cry!
[127:52.72]They gotta get out of here before they come back.
[127:54.50]Ah, whatever.
[127:55.22]I was gonna say, he kicks the door and he's like, Hey!
[127:57.81]Remember me?
[127:58.81]And then he lets me out.
[128:00.35]Whatever.
[128:00.71]It would've been funny.
[128:15.58]I couldn't even think of the name.
[128:16.76]They're all, like, Far Cry.
[128:18.12]Far Out.
[128:20.34]Fall Out.
[128:21.46]Fall Guys.
[128:22.36]Fall Cry.
[128:23.61]Cry Far.
[128:24.77]Like, how many... Whatever.
[128:28.43]These poor guys' hands.
[128:46.25]Kind of wish like all his fingers would be like Like oh cool, that'd be totally video game of this wouldn't it By the way, why did I wink?
[128:57.43]She didn't say it.
[128:58.11]She didn't say Dimitrescu.
[128:59.95]That one was free Crimson glass It was a free wing, alright guys, there's a big lever here
[129:16.30]I take that.
[129:16.74]Okay, hold on.
[129:19.40]I have yet to understand what the fucking goal is because every time I walk in a room, one of the main characters is like, oh, let's play with him.
[129:25.92]And then there's no goal.
[129:26.78]They just like do something weird and leave.
[129:32.18]Look for Rose in the castle.
[129:33.48]Okay.
[129:44.47]Easy to pick lock.
[129:45.25]I need a lock pick.
[129:53.35]Get in there.
[129:55.16]Oh, secret hidden tunnel.
[130:02.56]Not yet.
[130:02.92]Hold on.
[130:03.26]There's probably stuff.
[130:05.67]Yeah, there's like something in here.
[130:08.33]Books, things to read.
[130:09.69]Can I leave?
[130:10.11]Can I just open the door?
[130:12.19]No, of course not.
[130:12.87]Alright, well, there's a lockpick thing right there.
[130:15.05]I'm just going to come back with a lockpick.
[130:17.24]And let's go.
[130:23.41]By the way, I think since using the 3090, I think this room has increased its temperature by five full degrees.
[130:31.87]I need like an air conditioning unit or my computer.
[130:36.72]I swear to God, I think it's probably 80 plus degrees in here right now.
[130:42.70]Scrap, okay.
[130:43.78]I can make some stuff.
[130:52.16]Pick up the baby.
[130:54.22]Rune Eye Ring.
[130:59.12]Throw your case?
[130:59.92]No.
[131:00.12]I don't do that.
[131:03.94]You guys will, like, make fun of my, like, cable management or something.
[131:07.58]It'll always be something.
[131:08.36]Throw your case.
[131:10.61]Throw your case.
[131:10.99]Oh, wow.
[131:11.39]Nice cable management.
[131:12.33]Like, whatever.
[131:12.91]I don't care.
[131:24.07]Okay.
[131:25.85]We know the bedchamber, so Hall of the Four, which is... Oh, wait.
[131:28.29]I can open this door now.
[131:29.05]Wait.
[131:29.23]What's that?
[131:30.75]There's a coin in here.
[131:33.05]Can I break this?
[131:35.31]Crystal Fragment.
[131:35.97]Hell yeah.
[131:36.55]Alright.
[131:36.81]Okay.
[131:44.54]Where's the next... Wait.
[131:45.94]Wait.
[131:51.54]on ray tracing for just a little bit I don't know it'll get it'll be 100 degrees in here ray tracing's a meme guys it doesn't matter alright so that's like a little shortcut to the bed chamber
[132:17.32]I mean like it's cool but it's really cool but I don't know I don't really care to like increase my like graphics card energy consumption by like 150 to like have the floors be reflective I don't I don't care I would I would I have my like comfort in this room of it being 80 degrees way more put it I put it so much higher than like a reflective screen like a reflective mirror
[132:46.24]This shit, it will be roasting in here.
[132:50.40]It's cool.
[132:50.94]I don't hate it, but... I need, like, a fucking car exhaust on here.
[132:59.89]Ask the angels.
[133:00.75]Blind the gaze.
[133:01.57]Okay.
[133:05.94]The ring.
[133:06.38]Okay.
[133:07.58]Mask the angels.
[133:08.64]Blind the gaze.
[133:14.10]Okay, I'll figure that out later.
[133:15.94]This is like the ultimate puzzle probably.
[133:17.38]Okay.
[133:23.24]Let's go up.
[133:24.83]Seems to be the place to go.
[133:25.59]This is a cool house.
[133:28.61]Nice.
[133:35.54]I gotta save money.
[133:45.13]How many suits of armor?
[133:46.14]This is... That's weird.
[133:48.32]I have a suit of armor.
[133:49.18]This many suits of armor in your house.
[133:50.30]It's too many.
[133:50.70]I can understand one.
[133:54.02]More than one is very strange.
[133:55.44]I'm gonna T. Is that lipstick or blood?
[134:07.73]Or both?
[134:08.35]Why would you drink blood?
[134:12.03]Okay, is it weird that I find it less disgusting if they were to literally cook me and eat me than if they were to drink my blood while I'm alive?
[134:19.59]I find that to be, like, just less gross.
[134:28.21]Can I unlock this?
[134:30.24]I can.
[134:32.46]Excellent.
[134:32.76]Alright, so now there's a way to get around this whole house.
[134:35.28]Let's go up here.
[134:38.96]I'm going up.
[134:48.70]I hear something moving.
[134:53.30]Wine room.
[134:54.20]Ooh.
[134:55.26]This is gonna be blood.
[134:59.24]Alright, I can make shotgun.
[135:04.68]Whoa, I can make 30... Whoa, no I can't.
[135:06.92]I need two rusted scrap.
[135:08.24]Shit.
[135:10.86]Wait.
[135:13.64]Wait, how many rusted scrap do I have?
[135:14.78]Just one?
[135:15.08]Whatever.
[135:17.56]Why am I making tech... Whatever.
[135:18.80]I don't care.
[135:19.18]Put the ring on it.
[135:24.03]You can't use that.
[135:25.39]What, like a gravy boat?
[135:26.71]Alright, I gotta, like, put gravy in the gravy boat or whatever I need to do.
[135:35.38]I gotta remember this.
[135:40.62]Ah, the French champagne.
[135:41.76]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[135:45.83]There is a California champagne by Paul Masson.
[135:49.69]I love that guy.
[135:53.39]Ring.
[135:53.69]Maroon eye ring.
[135:56.03]You can't use this as is.
[135:57.26]Why not?
[135:57.58]Take the eye out?
[136:01.52]Can I like examine it?
[136:02.22]Okay.
[136:07.28]Maroon eye.
[136:07.90]Alright.
[136:09.66]I know where that goes.
[136:13.82]Say Aaron.
[136:14.12]Aaron.
[136:17.50]Okay, I'll do a Kickstarter campaign for $1.4 million.
[136:20.64]And if it gets to $1.4 million, I will say Aaron on stream.
[136:26.36]How's that sound?
[136:35.99]I need to save the game.
[136:38.13]Very, very badly.
[136:39.05]I have not saved the game since...
[136:49.96]Fuck.
[136:50.40]This guy's hands!
[136:53.63]What?
[136:53.81]Oh god.
[136:54.19]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[136:55.61]Let's not do that.
[136:58.69]I- nothing, neither.
[136:59.55]Can I hide in the closet?
[137:00.71]What do I do?
[137:01.37]Oh my god!
[137:29.07]I thought this just said Jerma985.
[137:31.81]To Jerma985.
[137:33.67]It was my first day working at the castle today.
[137:35.93]I was most shocked to see the other staff were all women.
[137:38.73]The mistress and her daughters were very adamant that they wouldn't bite.
[137:41.91]It was quite peculiarly earlier.
[137:44.57]It's been two weeks since I started working at the castle and I'm a little afraid.
[137:47.75]Another maid, Adela, made a mistake and Miss Daniela slashed her face with a knife.
[137:53.39]And at night I can hear wailing as if ghosts roam the halls.
[137:56.19]I want to go home.
[137:58.46]I don't know what to do.
[137:59.70]The young ladies were complaining it was too hot and stuffy during dinner.
[138:03.36]So I opened the window just to crack.
[138:05.64]Shut it!
[138:06.00]Shut it now!
[138:06.50]They all shrieked at me in unison.
[138:08.72]Looks like I'm going to have to suffer with my 3090 in my own bedroom in heat.
[138:14.70]That was funny.
[138:15.40]I refuse to see fucking minus twos.
[138:16.94]That was actually really funny.
[138:19.66]I fear I may be taken down into the cellar and never to be seen again.
[138:22.09]I don't know what to do.
[138:22.95]I don't know what to do.
[138:24.07]That was funny.
[138:25.09]Don't fucking tell me it wasn't.
[138:26.21]I know when it was funny.
[138:27.57]Because I know.
[138:43.09]Now it's funny.
[138:45.27]Now it's funny.
[138:59.88]This game is really cool.
[139:02.26]I'm really into it.
[139:03.81]Oh my god, is that Lady Dimitrescu?
[139:19.37]Hey Cabbagehead, PhD, thanks for the 25 community subs.
[139:23.29]That's a lot of money, thank you.
[139:25.85]Tasting Room, thanks for the 25 subs.
[139:30.45]My eyes just went too far when I looked over at chat.
[139:32.91]That hurt.
[139:33.27]Do they chase you around the house?
[139:36.40]Oh my god, they probably do.
[139:37.32]Did I go in that door she just opened?

[140:32.52]Alright, light it up.
[140:42.67]What does that do?
[140:53.52]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[140:54.90]He walks down the hall with a sledgehammer.
[141:01.78]Where the hell am I?
[141:11.55]What the fuck?
[141:12.67]It's covered in dried blood.
[141:14.29]I don't understand.
[141:18.18]Was this like putting somebody inside of that?
[141:20.68]Oh!
[141:32.71]Alright.
[141:32.87]I have to be honest with you.
[141:36.06]I feel like this would kind of feel kind of good.
[141:40.24]I have like chest and like back pain issues and I feel like sitting there and pushing back on those just lightly would hit like a bunch of pressure points if I didn't do it too hard.
[142:00.27]You're a freak.
[142:17.05]Alright.
[142:18.58]I wouldn't want to put that on somebody.
[142:21.04]You know what I mean?
[142:21.46]Wouldn't that be fucking terrifying?
[142:22.82]Like, oh, yeah, yeah, go get the pig mask thing.
[142:27.44]No, no, I don't want to do that.
[142:28.50]That's scary, man.
[142:29.44]Like, that's fucking terrifying to me.
[142:35.28]Can't we just, like, beat the shit out of him?
[142:37.82]Why do we have to, like, put, like, a fucking weird mask on him?
[142:40.63]I don't want to do that.
[142:44.71]Help me, brother.
[142:50.04]It's a horror game.
[142:50.96]I know, but, like, I'm just saying, like, that's... They used to do all kinds of fucked up shit back in, like, the medieval times and stuff.
[142:57.85]It's like, why would you want to do that?
[143:07.67]Like, look at all this stuff.
[143:08.33]I don't want to, like, pull somebody's fucking teeth out while they sit on, like, a bunch of spikes and nails.
[143:23.03]You missed a save point?
[143:24.53]I did?
[143:25.11]Where?
[143:25.31]Did I just close myself in a cell?
[143:31.50]Next to the angel.
[143:42.23]Where?
[143:48.38]Hold on a second.
[144:03.49]This is a cool photo.
[144:04.53]Focus area right up in the front.
[144:24.07]Actually cool.
[144:24.65]It's a cool photo.
[144:35.49]I wish I could actually use a scroll with this.
[144:37.95]Wow, this is such a weird way to do this.
[144:40.19]Focus area.
[144:40.79]I want it, like, back.
[144:45.66]Why can't I go back with the focus area?
[144:47.46]There you go.
[144:52.86]Okay.
[145:00.88]It's a console port.
[145:04.13]Blur strength.
[145:04.71]Yeah, I want it to be blurry up here.
[145:06.33]Focus area.
[145:09.65]Where is this focus area?
[145:12.55]I don't even know what the fuck they're trying to tell me.
[145:13.89]Please play the game.
[145:16.98]I'm taking a picture in photo mode.
[145:19.72]I want to do this.
[145:22.92]I can't take less than five seconds to do this?
[145:26.08]I mean, it's been probably two minutes, but still.
[145:33.56]I think it's a cool photo.
[145:43.35]Wait, I didn't know I could do these.
[145:44.49]I could have had a newspaper for the... I could have had it on this.

[160:04.85]Fake Fiji.
[160:07.95]If she is truly here, the lady of the castle would have kept little Rose in her private chambers, would she not?
[160:15.68]Domitrescu?
[160:17.22]The very same.
[160:18.98]Why don't you take a look?
[160:21.10]Maybe you'll get lucky.
[160:23.04]And speaking of looking, care to make a purchase?
[160:26.93]It's Domitrescu.
[160:29.21]It's not Dimitrescu?
[160:34.00]It's Dimitrescu.
[160:35.80]Dimitrescu.
[160:37.64]Dimitresc?

[161:13.77]Can things go?
[161:14.33]Wait a minute.
[161:14.65]Let me just check.
[161:21.09]It would say, okay.
[161:23.67]Sell it all.
[161:26.74]It would actually say, like, combinable.
[161:28.44]Okay.

[161:45.27]You can like touch this stuff and like look around at it.
[161:47.37]Examine.
[161:52.27]Alright, maybe this is like the thing I can touch or open or click on.

[161:57.11]Hold on.
[161:57.37]No?
[161:57.59]Nothing?
[161:57.91]Nothing?
[162:06.94]No?
[162:09.39]I guess I don't think so.
[162:10.59]It's an escape room.
[162:12.49]Wait, I know, but like I'm serious.
[162:14.61]There's probably like a button on this shit somewhere.
[162:18.95]I'm serious.
[162:20.69]This is just Skyrim.
[162:22.12]It's not... Alright, you owe us a wink.
[162:23.88]There you go.
[162:26.14]What about the glass?
[162:28.76]Alright, please spam yes if I'm overthinking the absolute hell out of this.

[162:59.57]Mines.
[163:00.15]I could just buy some first aid.
[163:01.27]Shotgun ammo.
[163:04.30]High capacity magazine.
[163:06.16]Hair trigger.
[163:09.23]Greatly increases fire rate.
[163:18.06]Probably slots.
[163:20.16]I'm going to do the save thing.
[163:22.06]Give me the save thing.
[163:25.90]I'm going to buy... I'm buying one of those.
[163:31.81]And... I'm going to buy some shotgun ammo.
[163:35.99]How much should I buy?
[163:36.51]Okay.
[163:38.28]It's 1000 for one shot?
[163:40.58]No, thank you.
[163:42.90]Did I get the boom, boom, boom?
[163:45.64]The shotgun?
[163:50.03]Greatly increases fire rate.
[163:51.15]I think I'm going to do it.
[163:54.95]Yeah, I want it.
[163:58.09]Nice.
[163:58.29]Alright, I'm out of money.
[164:01.40]I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons.
[164:03.08]Thank you for your patronage.
[164:05.81]He just yelled that at me.
[164:08.01]That was weird.
[164:08.41]Okay.
[164:10.26]Way more space.
[164:11.08]Let me rearrange.
[164:17.50]How do I rearrange?
[164:21.61]Shift.
[164:21.97]Move.
[164:22.21]Okay.
[164:27.93]Let me clean up my inventory.
[164:28.95]It's a mess.
[164:42.93]That's better.
[164:43.53]No.
[164:44.61]Yeah, see, that's much better.
[164:45.48]Shotgun ammo.
[164:48.34]Let's get it.
[164:55.09]It's a Tarkov inventory.
[164:56.67]Holy shit.
[164:58.19]Look at how far away this was.
[164:59.19]This was an hour and 45 minutes ago.
[165:11.45]I would have been so sad if I didn't get it.
[165:12.95]Okay.
[165:15.27]So, what actually is supposed to go here?
[165:17.47]Let me pick out some keywords.
[165:19.92]Labyrinth.
[165:20.96]House on a hill.
[165:21.54]Water wheel.
[165:22.46]Iron tower.
[165:24.20]Labyrinth.
[165:24.62]Unique.
[165:25.20]Special crafted metal ball.
[165:27.10]Special metal ball.
[165:28.04]Okay, I need a special metal ball.
[165:42.96]Where have I not gone?
[165:43.54]Uh... I could... I could go this way.
[165:47.87]We'll go into Lady... Lady Demetra Sue's chambers.
[165:55.23]What's this?
[165:58.55]Is that guy alright?
[166:00.51]What just happened?
[166:01.35]Wait, what?
[166:05.79]What did he do?
[166:13.84]By the way, that guy's definitely sitting on the toilet.
[166:16.10]I would be shocked if he wasn't.
[166:17.10]Okay, we need to go to Lady Dimitris's chamber.
[166:22.85]Let's just go this way, right?
[166:26.29]Bed chamber.
[166:34.96]Q is spin.
[166:35.78]I gotta remember that.
[166:44.43]Nothing here?
[166:44.89]This is not Lady Dimitrescu's chamber?
[166:46.38]Isn't this her bedroom?
[166:55.68]Is this not her bedroom?
[166:56.52]Fuck.
[167:03.12]I think it's upstairs.
[167:10.50]Just saying it to piss us off now.
[167:11.88]I don't... I don't... I'm sorry.
[167:14.06]I have my own headcanon.
[167:16.98]Dimit... Dimitrescu sounds much more... I don't know.
[167:21.36]What was it?
[167:21.74]I don't even know.
[167:22.17]I don't remember even what it was because I find it to be something I don't want to say.
[167:32.35]Domit... Domitresc.
[167:35.75]That sounds... Okay, so, like, have you heard, like, oh, what would you like on your taco?
[167:40.66]I'll take a jalapeño, please.
[167:43.54]It's jalapeño.
[167:45.32]Like, I feel like Dometresque is Dimitrescu.
[167:54.75]That's not how language works.
[168:02.37]What do you want me to say?
[168:03.73]Alright, I need to go D-E-E.
[168:10.66]You're the one saying jalapeño, though.
[168:14.87]Whatever.
[168:19.91]Is the wine room?
[168:21.39]No.
[168:21.87]Okay, now where are we going?
[168:23.61]Where's Dimitris's chambers?
[168:30.72]Here?
[168:31.84]Walk from the other side, sure.
[168:33.14]Where's this lady sleep?
[168:38.84]Ugh!
[168:55.61]Oh, I have the bottle of wine.
[169:06.44]Ooh.
[169:07.02]Ooh, courtyard key.
[169:17.85]I got a new key.
[169:18.49]Is that right?
[169:22.71]Nice.
[169:24.23]Let me look at what it says.
[169:27.64]A key for the door from the castle's dining hall to the courtyard.
[169:31.04]Down to the dining hall.
[169:31.86]Do you want the bottles?
[169:35.88]I don't want to waste bullets, no.
[169:55.69]Don't break all this shit.
[170:00.32]God damn it.
[170:01.58]Where do I go?
[170:02.44]Where's the dining room?
[170:03.99]Dining room is behind me.
[170:05.03]So it's behind her.
[170:07.11]So I'm going to run.
[170:08.13]I'm just going to do a juke and run right by her.
[170:10.31]Here we go.
[170:14.10]Oh, she's fast.
[170:15.30]She's fast.
[170:16.54]She's fast.
[170:18.68]Oh, she's fast.
[170:21.00]Oh, she's fast.
[170:24.54]Oh.
[170:33.74]Alright, that was not hard.
[170:42.78]Think fast!
[170:43.68]Think fast!
[170:44.34]I can do it.
[170:45.57]Think fast!
[170:47.43]Sora!
[170:47.97]Think fast!
[170:48.85]Think fast!
[170:50.29]I can do it.
[170:51.85]Think fast!
[170:53.17]Nope.
[170:54.37]Think fast!
[170:56.93]It's close.
[170:59.05]Think fast!
[171:00.20]Think fast!
[171:01.18]There it is.
[171:11.88]Oh, I need another.
[171:12.50]I don't know what that is.
[171:21.08]There's no doors.
[171:25.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[171:29.11]Open.
[171:38.37]OK.
[171:42.44]I'm getting a shock out of this one.
[171:43.66]I thought I had 38 rounds.
[171:44.97]I was like, wow, I just beat the game wicked easily.
[171:57.91]Titans in Aaron's voice.
[171:59.22]No.
[172:00.50]That gets me in trouble.
[172:01.28]I'm not doing it.
[172:13.74]I gotta like open the window so light comes in so I can shoot the people.
[172:18.16]You know I'm here?
[172:23.31]Oh, a map.
[172:37.14]Oh, dude!
[172:38.84]Dude!
[172:40.20]Dude!
[172:40.90]Yes!
[172:47.67]We're gonna... I'm gonna kill Lady Dimitrescu.
[172:56.02]Dude.
[173:00.90]Hello, it's me, Daughter Killer.
[173:03.50]I'd like to talk to you.
[173:04.40]I'd like to have a little bit of conversation.
[173:25.90]What is that for?
[173:32.51]What are these?
[173:32.91]Why are they holes?
[173:35.13]It's a gamer chair?
[173:41.00]That's so stupid.
[173:56.85]What do I have to do there?
[174:01.10]What have you done to my daughter?
[174:04.10]My daughter!
[174:06.50]What do you do?
[174:12.60]My daughter!
[174:13.95]There's nothing I can do in here.
[174:21.52]women are blind to male advances but the poor shall take their chances to give their lord their bounty sown so that that soon the wine may flow like move them women are blind to male advances
[174:45.78]But male advances turn toward... What was it?
[174:51.38]Women are blind to male advances, but the poor shall take their chances to give their lord the bounty sworn so that soon the wine may flow.
[175:01.01]Okay, so they have to... This is the lord.
[175:02.69]Who's this?
[175:17.48]Women are blind to male advances.
[175:20.31]So you look this way.
[175:22.27]Yeah.
[175:27.63]I got it.
[175:29.51]That's the lord and that's the wine.
[175:30.99]I know.
[175:31.91]What do you think?
[175:32.29]I don't know what I'm doing.
[175:35.41]My goodness.
[175:40.17]What a gamer.
[175:44.28]Thanks.
[175:49.97]I fell asleep.
[175:52.01]Well, then you must not even have the volume on, because there's... Okay, if you're sleeping on this stream, the stream's muted.
[175:57.29]There's been screams and shit.
[175:59.03]Shotgun blasts in your ears.
[176:00.51]Like, there's no way you're watching the stream muted.
[176:01.93]You know how many times I've screamed in the last hour?
[176:09.96]Like, as loud as my body can probably do it.
[176:22.18]Damn it.
[176:22.96]Okay, this is gonna be scary.
[176:23.98]I know it.
[176:24.32]This is gonna be scary.
[176:28.82]This is gonna be a scary monster.
[176:35.27]Yes, there is.
[176:39.71]Can I jump over this?
[176:40.67]Nope.
[176:44.09]I just have to kill this guy.
[176:56.50]Where'd he go?
[176:57.04]He's in the water.
[177:00.64]Oh my god!
[177:01.25]Is that him?
[177:02.63]No.
[177:23.15]Women are blind to male advances, but male advances take their chances.
[177:27.22]For the lord they seek to swore their keep.
[177:31.12]The wine will flow.
[177:31.96]Falls deep.
[177:34.44]I don't know.
[177:36.95]Whatever it was.
[177:37.69]I think there's another one right here.
[177:52.57]That low recoil is awesome.
[177:53.99]That's really useful.
[177:58.96]Hold on, I gotta reapply.
[178:00.74]This is important.
[178:12.97]Remember, that sounded like iPhone predict text.
[178:16.36]Sometimes I feel like I actually am doing iPhone predict text.
[178:20.72]Sometimes my brain goes too fast and has to just say words that just sound like they might fit there.
[178:25.91]It actually happens all the time.
[178:26.83]Fuck.
[178:38.84]Too close.
[178:39.56]You're too close.
[178:43.33]He was just way too close.
[178:44.23]I'm sorry.
[178:45.73]Way too close.
[178:52.51]What the hell was that for?
[178:53.55]That didn't do anything for me.
[178:54.33]That just screwed everything up.
[179:00.08]No, open this.
[179:00.56]I'm going to have to close this on somebody.
[179:03.14]Somebody's going to be coming down this way and I'm going to have to close it on him.
[179:11.48]Like right now.
[179:13.02]Like right now.
[179:13.50]Close it.
[179:18.61]Where'd they go?
[179:19.05]Free shots.
[179:31.78]Okay.
[179:39.68]Worked out.
[179:43.75]Vipers, drink the bong water.
[179:51.73]Bong water.
[180:06.11]I can't see anything!
[180:13.68]Alright, I'm gonna make some handgun ammo.
[180:20.91]This game is actually pretty scary.
[180:22.65]It's really scary.
[180:36.70]Run!
[180:42.28]Run!
[180:42.50]Run!
[180:42.74]Run!
[180:50.10]Alright, I gotta make handgun ammo.
[180:54.64]Aaron.
[180:59.55]Where the fuck are you?
[181:01.11]Oh, that was not a smart play.
[181:10.03]Very, very unintelligent play there.
[181:17.21]I'm making a lot of money.
[181:17.97]This is good.
[181:18.79]Okay, hold on.
[181:19.31]I need ammo.
[181:20.54]I have three med kits.
[181:22.66]I'm doing fine.
[181:23.46]Okay.
[181:27.34]Should I just make a shitload of shotgun bullets or what?
[181:28.94]What do you think?
[181:34.18]Just make six shotgun shells?
[181:35.68]Just have just a massive amount of bullets?
[181:37.82]What should I make?
[181:38.94]Be safe.
[181:42.02]Oh, whatever.
[181:42.37]I'm gonna make these.
[181:51.41]Still something in here that I'm missing.
[182:00.41]I gotta pee too.
[182:01.27]I'm gonna go- I gotta do my first pee and then I'm gonna refill my fake Fiji water.
[182:18.30]Why are you here?
[182:28.85]I get a lot of items.
[182:33.61]I hear something.
[182:38.70]Oh wait, what is this?
[182:39.36]Alright, I got everything.
[182:45.28]Look at his face.
[182:45.90]My spit just came all over my mouth.
[183:02.91]Guys, you're over there.
[183:03.43]Alright.
[183:06.89]Demetrius is... I know.
[183:08.58]Whatever.
[183:09.00]I don't care.
[183:09.66]A thousand bucks.
[183:21.43]Holy shit.
[183:25.55]I don't want to go in here yet.
[183:26.61]I want to go back outside here because it's stuff.
[183:30.87]There's phones in Resident... I didn't even think there'd be like a telephone in this game.
[183:49.16]It's 2020.
[184:00.57]Hello?
[184:01.05]Hello, hello?
[184:02.09]I'm sorry.
[184:02.73]I regret to inform you that Ethan Winters has escaped that fool Heisenberg.
[184:10.89]Because he is in my castle and has already proven too much for my daughters to handle.
[184:15.27]When I find him... No, Mother Miranda.
[184:22.01]Yes, of course, I understand the importance of the ceremony.
[184:26.20]I won't let you down.
[184:29.96]Why does she have a reflection?
[184:31.12]Holy shit.
[184:32.38]Um.
[184:45.52]What is going on in this game?
[184:46.98]I have no idea what the story is.
[184:48.10]I'm the guy from the last game.
[184:51.54]In the last game, there was that old- Like, spoilers if you haven't played Resident Evil 7, but what the hell are you watching Resident Evil 8 for in the first place?
[184:57.95]There was the la- The old lady in the chair was, like, the antagonist.
[185:02.59]And... It was, like, this experiment, right?
[185:05.03]There was a boat.
[185:06.49]You- You had, like, this- Your girlfriend was, like, the runner of a project.
[185:14.84]That, like, had to do with this little girl.
[185:17.13]And the little girl, like, aged rapidly into an old lady.
[185:23.61]And, like, she was controlling everybody.
[185:26.57]Everyone was, like, under her control.
[185:27.77]She was making them do, like, crazy things.
[185:37.00]She was the little girl's caretaker.
[185:38.48]Yeah, right, right.
[185:40.79]But then, we, like, escape the island, Chris Redfield's like, Nice job, nice job, partner.
[185:46.52]And... Now Chris Redfield wants to take my baby, and, like, killed Mia.
[185:52.44]And now we're in this weird, like, fucking cartoon Avengers house.
[185:57.75]I guess we're gonna figure it out.
[185:59.81]With, like, this vampire lady, this, like, little, like, corpse bride person, Igor...
[186:09.25]and fucking, like, cool, like, Mortal Kombat Elvis.
[186:19.94]We're just gonna find out.
[186:27.95]We were all called by Mother Miranda to decide the fate of the child's father, me.
[186:32.52]Just thinking of that family meeting makes me shudder to think I am treated like a sister to those miscreants, especially Heisenberg.
[186:40.02]That riffraff wouldn't know proper manners if they slapped him in the face.
[186:43.73]I would have sliced him into ribbons if mother hadn't.
[186:45.49]Okay, so mother, why does she treat me the same as them?
[186:49.37]She gave me the castle, obedient daughter's everlasting life, did she not?
[186:52.58]Am I not her favorite?
[186:53.34]Am I not special?
[187:01.73]I didn't even realize just how tall this, how tall she is.
[187:13.07]That's fucking huge.
[187:19.54]Wow Just realized I mean I mean Every time I've seen her I've been like crouching looking up or like in chains looking up at her I've never like actually stood up like face to face She like picked me up and put me on like hooks What am I supposed to do here?
[187:44.41]Look for Rose in the castle
[187:49.40]Can I move this?
[187:51.78]Oh, all this shit's locked.
[187:54.30]Does it open the door from the other side?
[187:58.57]Where am I supposed to go?
[188:17.20]I'm stuck in her bedroom.
[188:26.79]Okay.
[188:28.13]Dimitrescu Key.
[188:29.77]It's the one... That's what these keys... Okay, these doors.
[188:32.68]There's a couple of them I need to go to.
[188:33.78]Oh, shit.
[188:36.32]There you go.
[188:38.46]All this for a child who isn't even here.
[188:42.47]What the hell do... You ungrateful, selfish wretch!
[188:47.57]You come into my house!
[188:49.67]You lay your filthy manhands on my daughters!
[188:55.02]And now you even try to steal my property!
[189:05.01]Rest while you can... ...because I will... ...hunt you... ...AND I WILL BREAK YOU!
[189:12.49]Go ahead... ...do your worst!
[189:20.20]She's like falling, screaming like she fell in the same hole or something.
[189:24.48]She lands right on her neck.
[189:26.52]And fucking you hear just crunches.
[189:29.02]Her legs, her knees hit the fucking ground behind her.
[189:32.78]And her neck just snaps off.
[189:38.17]If I fall through there, she falls through there too.
[189:40.57]She's got like at least fucking 300 pounds on me.
[189:46.89]How is the floor holding her if I fall through the floor?
[189:53.63]She put in so much force.
[189:55.96]I don't buy it.
[189:56.42]That's rude.
[190:08.47]She's like 12 feet tall.
[190:13.64]I'm just saying she's big.
[190:14.82]She's very large.
[190:15.90]She's like 12 and a half feet tall.
[190:17.62]9 feet tall.
[190:19.52]Sorry.
[190:20.24]Sorry, I got it wrong.
[190:22.44]She's like 10 feet tall.
[190:24.27]If you were 10 feet tall, you would probably weigh like 300 fucking pounds.
[190:35.76]Alright, let's go.
[190:40.37]No, I wouldn't.
[190:40.99]Yes, you would.
[190:41.85]You'd just be a large person.
[190:47.79]Let me look up.
[190:48.21]Alright.
[190:48.67]How much does Shaq weigh?
[190:51.09]How tall is Shaq?
[190:53.19]Shaq's like 7'5", right?
[190:55.29]Like 8 feet tall?
[190:57.49]How much does Shaq weigh?
[191:05.62]Shaq is 7'2".
[191:08.44]So Lady Dimitrescu is like three feet taller than Shek.
[191:16.97]I'm going to guess that she's probably 300 tons.
[191:30.70]She's gonna chase me around, right?
[191:34.28]This is a boss room.
[191:35.40]This is like a weird boss room.
[191:42.05]Shaq is 324 pounds, okay.
[191:43.35]Alright, oh god, what is going- this is a boss room.
[191:46.87]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[191:47.59]I don't have any hands!
[191:54.15]Boss fight!
[192:12.58]Oi.
[192:14.46]Where'd she go?
[192:15.18]Whoa.
[192:18.50]Whoa.
[192:22.04]My hand.
[192:24.66]Pull it.
[192:28.76]Cut the other hand off.
[192:30.42]Whoa.
[192:30.84]She's probably right here.
[192:35.92]Whoa.
[192:40.38]Ooh, a box.
[192:42.25]I can't right- I- I can't use my hand!
[192:43.92]Duck!
[192:46.76]Move out of the way!
[193:11.08]You actually thought I was going to let you get away, darling.
[193:15.80]Okay.
[193:16.34]Yep.
[193:16.86]This time, don't freak out.
[193:18.88]Just press it again.
[193:19.72]Ow.
[193:20.80]Ow.
[193:40.63]There it is.
[193:41.27]You will learn what it means to insult an outstomach mask.
[193:45.43]I'm a- no!
[193:46.51]Don't waste my time.
[193:52.07]Fucks you.
[193:54.29]What the fuck am I doing?
[193:55.59]Let's wrap things up.
[194:13.07]Any items?
[194:13.57]Any stuff?
[194:14.41]Stuff?
[194:16.23]Any items?
[194:17.01]Nope.
[194:17.41]Go.
[194:22.99]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[194:24.41]Open the door.
[194:24.93]Key.
[194:26.95]Open it!
[194:29.77]Oh, jeez.
[194:31.45]Okay, I got the Mask of Sorrow.
[194:37.22]Oh, jeez.
[194:48.50]Like that.
[194:49.62]I guess I'll try.
[194:50.50]What?
[194:51.84]Is this guy like a Roblox character?
[195:00.16]Like, what is he made of?
[195:00.94]Legos?
[195:02.60]Did it work?
[195:10.79]Good.
[195:11.75]It worked.
[195:12.67]Man, screw this castle.
[195:18.61]Did I use my guns?
[195:24.35]The fuck is making that sound?
[195:27.43]Escape the castle.
[195:32.04]I have, hold on, I have the Dimitrisou key.
[195:37.08]Right?
[195:38.36]Isn't there another Dimitrisou door?
[195:44.02]Right there.
[195:44.58]No?
[195:51.31]I swear to God, there's another Dimitrisou door.
[195:56.50]Oh.
[195:57.34]It's literally right behind me.
[196:03.09]Alright, where's the big- where's that fat guy?
[196:17.08]I need him.
[196:24.16]Everybody's spoiling.
[196:25.04]Spoiling what?
[196:26.12]I'm not even looking at chat.
[196:27.04]If you're sending me the look out for spoilers, spoiler alert.
[196:29.58]I'm not looking at the fucking chat.
[196:30.98]For like at least 20 minutes.
[196:42.91]Oh, nice.
[196:43.27]Castle map.
[196:45.17]Opera hall.
[196:48.45]Can I go in?
[196:49.13]I can't go in the opera hall.
[196:51.06]I'm not looking.
[196:51.40]I don't want to see.
[197:01.71]Let me actually, I need to do some crafting here.
[197:06.23]Yeah, give me another one.
[197:07.19]How's my health?
[197:07.67]Am I okay?
[197:11.00]Please be aware the mistress's lipstick is missing.
[197:12.98]If anyone finds it, could they please return it to her bathroom?
[197:15.82]It is custom made and therefore very expensive.
[197:46.66]What's this?
[197:56.39]What's that Metroid thing?
[198:07.98]Three girls have stopped moving.
[198:09.30]They seem almost dead.
[198:10.30]An insect flew out of the eldest's mouth.
[198:13.83]It appears to be a common fly.
[198:16.41]Two days since treatment.
[198:17.67]All three bodies are covered in flies.
[198:19.25]It appears the flies are consuming their flesh.
[198:21.57]When I opened, I got to pee.
[198:22.61]I'll be right back.
[206:36.28]I'm back.
[206:36.70]I'm back.
[206:37.04]Sorry.
[206:37.72]I dropped a coffee on the ground.
[206:41.10]I dropped it on the ground and it was a disaster.
[206:45.96]Yeah, the toilet got clogged.
[206:47.18]I had to plunge the toilet.
[206:52.79]It was a joke.
[206:55.89]Be lucky I wasn't gone for 40 minutes.
[207:01.80]But I'm ready to get back into it.
[207:03.12]Let's go.
[207:08.39]Oh, I got a question for all you PC enthusiasts here.
[207:12.36]So, I have a 3090, and this thing is loud and runs hot.
[207:22.58]How hard is it to put a new heat sink on this?
[207:29.79]Like, should I get, like, a water cooling system for the GPU?
[207:33.45]Because this thing is going like... Like, it sounds like a jet engine in here.
[207:44.72]Clean the fans.
[207:46.85]I mean, this is a... This is literally brand new.
[207:54.28]What 3090 is it?
[207:55.14]I don't know.
[207:57.72]Honestly, it was... All these graphics supplies are in such low supply that it just... Whatever one was available, I bought it.
[208:07.63]I don't even know what the brand is.
[208:09.05]Let me see.
[208:09.33]Let's see what the brand is.
[208:13.27]OTEC?
[208:21.18]OTEC?
[208:23.72]It's Zotac gaming?
[208:28.94]Zotag?
[208:30.86]I don't know.
[208:31.28]What's Zotac?
[208:38.37]I knew it.
[208:39.79]Those are the only ones that are available.
[208:42.59]What do you want me to do?
[208:47.76]Zotac is one of the brands.
[208:48.96]Yeah.
[208:49.66]Zotac is fine.
[208:50.32]Yeah, people are saying Zotac is good.
[208:51.62]Zotac is fine.
[208:52.41]Yeah, Zotac is fucking fine.
[208:53.81]What's wrong with Zotac?
[208:56.63]I haven't had any problems with it.
[208:57.97]The only problem I have is that I think it's a little loud.
[209:00.37]Like the fans.
[209:01.39]I just get to take the heatsink off, put a new one on.
[209:03.81]I mean, if you're going to have a 3090, 3090 is literally like a down payment on a house.
[209:09.76]Like it's like buying a car.
[209:11.78]So like I may as well like pony up to put like a liquid cooling system on it, right?
[209:24.00]Coming back.
[209:29.80]3090s run, just run hot.
[209:41.43]I got another fake Fiji.
[209:44.85]Why do you stream in 720p?
[209:46.83]Because I have only had a 3090 in the computer.
[209:51.39]Like three hours.
[209:54.14]Sorry.
[209:55.30]It's been like a little bit longer, but whatever.
[209:57.04]It's been like a few, whatever.
[209:58.60]It's been like a little while.
[210:00.69]Whatever.
[210:00.95]Alright.
[210:02.31]All three bodies have almost completely consumed by the insects.
[210:04.67]Insects eat people.
[210:06.23]It's just afternoon and the insects just started eating.
[210:08.65]Those around the face turned pale and the lips turned red.
[210:12.35]The mass of insects have transformed into human bodies again.
[210:15.94]All three girls awoke looking at me like newborns.
[210:18.94]I sense a bond between us like mother and daughters.
[210:21.42]I've already decided their names.
[210:28.11]Flies are turning into people.
[210:29.11]Okay, interesting.
[210:40.68]Every Zotac fan, uh, card I've bought had the fans die.
[210:44.04]Um, I mean, that's kind of anecdotal evidence, I think.
[210:47.66]But, I mean, still.
[210:49.89]They are pretty, they are churning right now.
[210:51.93]But it's just so hot in here.
[210:52.99]I gotta, like, get, I gotta figure out a solution.
[210:54.75]Alright, escape the castle.
[210:56.37]Let's just go.
[210:57.37]Whatever I was doing.
[211:11.40]Bingo.
[211:12.74]Bingo.
[211:16.74]Running out of bullets.
[211:18.20]This is bad.
[211:18.98]Need bullets.
[211:32.23]There's a big piano.
[211:34.67]Oh, wait.
[211:35.07]This is a piano.
[211:36.37]Can I play the piano?
[211:38.24]Yes!
[211:58.97]You didn't even look at the stage?
[212:19.06]What do you mean?
[212:20.00]What stage?
[212:21.79]Ooh, got the iron key.
[212:29.81]Oh, alright, it's an opera.
[212:30.65]You can tweak the fan curve using Zotac software.
[212:39.92]You're running at 1080p.
[212:41.10]You can make it quiet for a thermal ceiling of 78 degrees Celsius.
[212:44.26]That's good to know.
[212:45.10]Thank you.
[212:46.82]Probably use that.
[212:54.13]Alright, so the iron key.
[212:55.85]There are a few iron doors.
[212:58.11]There's still shit in here though.
[212:59.29]Alright, looking for iron doors.
[213:02.92]Where's an iron door?
[213:08.50]There are no iron doors here.
[213:09.64]There's an iron door down in like that weird chamber place.
[213:16.37]Which is this way.
[213:17.27]Alright, we're going there.
[213:22.34]Just spit on it.
[213:24.18]It would go... That wouldn't do anything.
[213:26.60]That'd be... Ban that fucking person.
[213:29.44]Seriously.
[213:30.28]What are you talking about?
[213:31.14]God.
[213:33.38]Okay, I need to go... This way, right?
[213:50.15]Okay.
[213:52.48]Because then I need to go down here.
[213:55.83]Right?
[213:56.09]That's an iron key, isn't it?
[214:11.08]Ah!
[214:11.22]Oh my god, it's Lady Dimitris!
[214:14.88]See?
[214:16.94]There you are.
[214:32.90]Where the fuck am I?
[214:35.86]Into the courtyard, let's go!
[214:36.82]Did she come down here?
[214:43.83]They really do have swords and shit.
[214:59.57]They really are Dark Souls enemies.
[215:01.99]Did she come out here?
[215:02.61]Oh my god, she actually comes out here!
[215:04.85]Alright, I need iron door.
[215:09.93]Which is I gotta go right down through the kitchen.
[215:13.97]Which is gonna bring me through here.
[215:16.76]I hope so, I don't know.
[215:25.00]Wait, I can burn her.
[215:26.22]Just run, fuck it.
[215:38.31]Down here?
[215:38.69]I'm making a mistake.
[215:41.81]Am I making a mistake?
[215:49.25]I don't think this is a mistake.
[215:50.47]I think this is a good idea.
[215:52.64]This is a good idea.
[215:54.60]If you're gonna shoot that many times, just get the money and go.
[215:59.28]I'm sorry.

[219:39.69]That was down here.
[219:44.55]Second floor is up here.
[219:45.91]There's a Dimitrisu, um... There's a Dimitrisu key over here.
[220:07.17]I got to go to the Hall of Pleasure.
[220:08.71]But first, I got to craft some stuff because I am almost out of ammo.
[220:17.90]Very important.
[220:18.54]Handgun's good.
[220:19.20]Alright.
[220:20.50]We're going to go to the Hall of Pleasure.
[220:22.36]So if I bang a left here and run straight, that'll take me down and go through the kitchen into the merchant's room.
[220:29.23]Let me stop there.
[220:32.76]And then I go to the second floor.
[220:34.00]Okay.
[220:34.48]Let me go.
[220:34.84]I gotta get to the merchant room.
[220:37.23]Down here.
[220:38.53]Into the main hall.
[220:40.07]Through the kitchen.
[220:40.63]Let's go.
[220:48.92]Shit.
[220:54.42]A pleasure room.
[220:58.84]It's kind of a creepy thing to name a room.
[221:07.01]Okay, here we go.
[221:07.89]She's gonna show up here and I'm gonna have to dodge around her.
[221:09.97]Alright, we're going just straight through there.
[221:14.33]Bang her right in the dining room.
[221:16.01]Okay, here we go.
[221:25.52]Ah!
[221:26.36]Oh my god, escape us if I have a headache.
[221:27.60]I have a headache.
[221:29.06]Oh my god, escape us if I have a headache now.
[221:31.64]I just popped a blood vessel in my brain.
[221:38.32]Wrong way.
[221:40.16]Shit!
[221:40.50]She saw me!
[221:41.32]Wrong way!
[221:41.94]Are you okay?
[221:50.57]Oh, I think so.
[221:51.97]I feel like I'm alright.
[221:58.53]Okay, we gotta go to the merchant's room.
[222:02.45]He is... No, wrong way.
[222:05.14]Turn around.
[222:05.62]Straight ahead.
[222:10.05]Alright, I finally feel safe.
[222:12.43]It's a pleasure to see you safe.
[222:14.35]How worthy.
[222:15.53]Coffee, anybody?
[222:16.95]No sign of Rose.
[222:18.49]I'm so sorry it turned out that way.
[222:22.69]Well, you'll find your way to her once you're out of this castle.
[222:27.62]Do you have need of anything for the road ahead?
[222:30.64]Yes.
[222:31.92]Welcome, welcome.
[222:33.66]You're sure to find something new.

[222:44.09]Ask of sorrow, the key, the iron key.
[222:49.42]Eyes are like so watery.
[222:56.34]Valuable, valuable.
[222:57.34]Okay, combinable.
[223:04.63]Crystal fragment, crystal skull, azure eye.
[223:07.75]Can the azure eye go in the skull?
[223:17.69]Or does everything hit?
[223:18.37]No.
[223:24.66]Oh my god, I have three of these.
[223:26.52]Holy shit.
[223:27.00]Okay, I'm going to hold on to that.

[223:59.62]Sell the shotgun, you schmuck.
[224:07.25]Ammo capacity?
[224:08.45]Don't do upgrades.

[224:11.25]Alright.
[224:11.53]Oh, there it is.
[224:13.15]Haha.

[229:42.72]How's my health?
[229:43.16]I think I'm fine.
[229:49.44]Played on hardcore and normal looks way too easy by comparison.
[229:53.22]Actually, I heard that hardcore in this game is way too hard.
[229:59.69]That's what I heard.
[230:07.81]Really?
[230:11.64]So that doesn't go there?
[230:12.96]I have to put the mask back.
[230:37.57]Of course there's a button on it.
[230:47.40]Okay.
[230:50.66]Back out we go.
[230:51.48]There's only one more of those sisters left, so that's all I have to worry about.
[230:54.82]Wait, there's something in here.

[231:17.19]Go into the Hall of Joy?
[231:18.47]Can I get in here now?
[231:20.53]This is blocked off.
[231:21.27]Maybe I can go this way.
[231:22.05]In here.
[231:36.44]Nothing.
[231:46.38]I don't want to go down.
[231:51.25]What is it?

[231:54.63]What's happening?
[231:56.76]I don't know what's happening right now.
[231:59.82]Do I go down?

[234:30.96]I don't want to go in the armory.
[234:32.53]Oh, I hate this.
[234:33.61]Alright, just run by or whatever.
[234:44.61]Fuck it, I'm going.
[234:56.16]I need to go...

[235:02.68]You know what I'm saying?
[235:17.63]Like, I can't go in the Hall of Joy.
[235:19.59]Did I get raided?
[235:23.09]Where's the raid?
[235:24.53]Who raided?
[235:31.45]Why do you force your viewers to watch this?
[235:33.11]Click the X on the top right of your window.
[235:44.74]Go read a book or something.
[235:55.01]Was the difficulty hardcore?
[236:00.03]Who raided?
[236:00.45]Go back to the courtyard.
[236:02.75]I can't...
[236:29.93]I'm not as kind as my daughters.
[236:41.82]Which way do I go?
[236:43.50]Okay, alright.
[236:44.36]Settle down.
[236:48.66]This way.
[236:53.59]She's right behind me!
[236:57.18]Imagine screaming distraction and throwing a grenade, like, into the air.
[237:01.24]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[237:03.24]Where do I need to go?
[237:06.43]Opera Hall... Will take me down here, which then... Down to the distillery?
[237:16.66]Where do I- Ultimately, where am I trying to go?
[237:19.24]I'm trying to go up to the library, second floor.
[237:21.99]So I'm right here.
[237:22.71]So if I go into the opera hall, I can go that way.
[237:25.73]So get to the opera hall.
[237:29.25]I need to go just bang a left right here.
[237:31.41]Okay, this is the opera hall.
[237:40.45]Now I should be able to go from here.
[237:41.91]Is there a typewriter anywhere?
[237:43.91]I don't know, probably not.
[237:49.22]From the opera hall, now we go up the stairs, which will take me up here, and then I go this way.
[237:57.14]Don't be up here.
[238:05.57]And then this way.
[238:17.30]And then straight on this way.
[238:19.02]Here we go.
[238:19.52]Alright, let's do it.
[238:20.10]Is there a typewriter anywhere?
[238:28.14]I thought she just said, you unlocked it.
[238:30.02]Oh, please.
[238:31.61]Break the glass in the ceiling!
[238:33.07]What?
[238:47.74]Break the glass to the ceiling, what are you doing?
[238:49.58]Break the glass to the ceiling.
[238:57.84]Oh!
[239:04.64]Close the window, close the window.
[239:12.39]No, no, no, open the window, close the window.
[239:17.65]Why are you doing this?
[239:20.69]Damn.
[239:21.76]Don't let her get close, Jeremy.
[239:24.62]Have you learned nothing?
[239:26.32]I don't want to die.
[239:35.19]I'm sick of bugs.
[239:41.21]All of the sisters are dead.
[239:49.52]All of them.
[239:50.52]All sisters have been vanquished.
[239:56.84]Hello, what's going on?
[239:58.19]What the hell just happened?
[240:00.25]What just happened?
[240:03.05]I'm so pumped up right now.
[240:05.01]This is why I can't play horror games.
[240:08.05]I get so bent out of shape about this stuff.
[240:10.39]I just started making noises, screaming and stuff.
[240:12.67]I can't play these.
[240:13.27]Let me get everything.
[240:20.81]It's probably a secret.
[240:30.84]Oh, there's still more in here.
[240:32.52]This door won't... Oh, yes it will.
[240:34.42]I thought it was locked.
[240:40.08]What is still in here?
[240:53.71]He's playing on normal like it's hardcore.
[240:57.25]Yeah, it's called... I'm fucking 36 this year and this is a scary game and I don't care how hard the game is.
[241:04.33]I don't want to fucking torture myself and play this on hard.
[241:17.18]See anything?
[241:19.16]There's got to be something I can shoot or pull or push or touch or...
[241:27.76]Where is it?
[241:28.40]There's something in here.
[241:29.18]I don't know.
[241:39.63]Too bad.
[241:40.53]Not giving it any more time.
[241:48.20]I got a feeling she's just going to pop out.
[241:53.20]Beauty and the Beast clock looking motherfucker over there.
[241:55.12]I don't know what's going to happen with that.
[241:56.36]I'm scared of it.
[242:08.33]Yes.
[242:09.13]Don't touch that.
[242:09.63]Come on.
[242:15.29]Let me see what this is first.
[242:17.69]This goes this way.
[242:18.77]I thought that was her running by.
[242:22.36]Okay.
[242:22.82]Now we're in this weird place.
[242:34.07]Okay.
[242:34.43]Can I make shotgun bullets?
[242:35.43]I need them.
[242:35.79]No, I can't.
[242:40.14]I'm running out on... I'm running low on stuff.
[242:41.66]Okay, I only need one more mask.
[242:53.72]What's this do?
[242:54.16]What's this?
[243:00.82]Let the five bells of this chamber ring out.
[243:03.16]Okay.
[243:10.97]Let me just see where they are first because I'm probably gonna summon her.
[243:26.46]She'll be like, what?
[243:28.62]You're hitting my bells again?
[243:31.15]And then she'll run after me.
[243:32.69]So we got one here.
[243:46.39]What's the point of this?
[243:51.87]Well, whatever.
[243:52.41]There's one there.
[244:01.74]Two.
[244:19.57]The bell?
[244:25.53]The five bells of this chamber.
[244:27.05]I only see two.
[244:27.89]Where are these other five?
[244:34.88]Are there three more bells in here?
[244:36.28]I have no idea where the hell that would be.
[244:39.30]Keep looking, nerd.
[244:48.21]It's not this entire area, right?
[244:59.46]Herb?
[245:02.56]Only that room?
[245:03.58]Where are the three more bells?
[245:45.05]I don't know what... I don't... I don't know.
[245:46.51]I really don't know.
[245:48.07]It's three.
[245:56.96]It's two more.
[246:16.18]Come on.
[246:16.80]Come on.
[246:17.34]What?
[246:17.64]I don't- I don't see them.
[246:25.50]This chamber.
[246:27.14]This chamber, huh?
[246:29.42]Okay.
[246:42.16]Where's the last one?
[246:52.86]This is the worst bit.
[246:54.74]This is not a bit!
[247:00.23]Does she have one like on her or something?
[247:21.85]Ooh, it was behind the Lady Dimitrescu photo.
[247:26.82]Oh my god, my eyes.
[247:52.66]Nobody's scary.
[247:53.22]Nobody's scary.
[247:53.74]Nobody's scary.
[247:54.26]Nobody's scary.
[248:16.72]Nope.
[248:23.45]I don't have my shotgun crutch.
[248:25.57]I don't like this.
[248:31.05]There's a lot of handgun ammo though.
[248:34.69]So that's good.
[248:43.49]What was that?
[248:44.43]Why did the magical goat just disappear?
[248:52.41]Treasure map.
[248:54.92]Oh, a dungeon?
[248:55.68]I heard there was something called the Dagger of Death's Flowers somewhere in this castle.
[249:04.18]It's apparently an antique from the Middle Ages that's coated in a concoction of poisons from across the continent.
[249:09.34]It's said to have been crafted to kill demons and monsters.
[249:12.24]Sounds fascinating, but no one knows where it is.
[249:13.86]Thanks for the tip.
[249:22.86]Oh, shit.
[249:25.14]Sniper mission incoming.
[249:27.85]F2 rifle.
[249:30.95]Nice.
[249:32.21]I'm pretty damn good at this.
[249:33.13]That's as far as it zooms.
[249:37.33]Oh.
[249:38.27]No.
[249:38.37]This is the worst sniper rifle I've ever seen in my life.
[249:43.55]What a horrible weapon.
[249:50.22]Okay.
[249:52.20]Well, whatever.
[249:52.64]Whatever.
[249:58.54]Any ammo for it?
[250:01.12]I'm probably gonna have to use it.
[250:02.35]I'm gonna have to snipe these guys, is what you're saying.
[250:52.21]You're gonna stop?
[250:52.93]What?
[251:00.90]Well, I'm gonna have to fight you on the ground.
[251:02.52]Can they grab me?
[251:15.59]Why would I get that close?
[251:19.07]Whoa!
[251:19.59]Run.
[251:23.78]Oh, wait!
[251:27.38]Bleh!
[251:43.10]Oh shit, I'm trying to wipe the raid!
[251:47.06]I kicked that guy!
[251:47.86]Kick that fucking guy right now!
[251:49.64]Kick him!
[251:51.98]Don't let him do any more.
[251:52.78]Just kick him.
[251:53.22]He'll have to phase out of the instance.
[251:55.02]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[252:13.79]Is this a zip line?
[252:18.06]Sniper rifle ammo.
[252:18.96]Sick.
[252:21.59]Sniper rifle ammo, sick.
[252:23.01]Oh my god.
[252:26.35]Sniper zipline, quick.
[252:37.33]Mask of rage, I got all the masks.
[252:38.89]I should be able to get out of this.
[252:47.97]Come here!
[252:50.79]Oh shit!
[252:51.79]Oh shit!
[252:55.93]Get off me!
[253:16.24]Die!
[253:18.37]I want his money!
[253:21.93]How do I get out of here?
[253:22.75]Give me his money.
[253:28.78]Give me his money.
[253:29.22]Give me his money.
[253:29.60]Good.
[253:31.34]Okay.
[253:32.60]I need to get out of here.
[253:36.48]Oh, there's a ladder.
[253:57.40]Load this shit.
[253:58.14]I'm not going in here just completely blind.
[254:05.46]Alright, what do we got?
[254:07.22]I have two of these.
[254:11.10]I want shotgun ammo.
[254:12.39]Let me give it to me.
[254:13.41]It's more important than health.
[254:16.09]It's my panic button.
[254:19.69]Okay, I'm ready.
[254:21.51]Now I need to just get out of here.
[254:22.65]Place all the angel masks.
[254:24.63]Just get the hell out of here.
[254:26.29]Just go down the elevator.
[254:30.20]Get me out.
[254:30.66]Let's go.
[254:31.00]Throw a pipe bomb at the merchant guy.
[254:36.71]No.
[254:43.25]How's my health?
[254:52.04]It's okay.
[254:56.30]This brings me back here, which now... Here we go.
[255:02.12]Entrance hall.
[255:02.77]I have all the masks.
[255:07.13]Place them, and then I should be able to continue.
[255:08.77]Good.
[255:13.67]That's what I want.
[255:16.43]Anything else in here?
[255:26.69]Stupid man thing.
[255:28.51]You won't live long, even if you run.
[255:33.21]Get back in the elevator.
[255:34.73]Get in the elevator.
[255:35.51]Get in the elevator.
[255:36.35]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

[258:56.39]Why does she know my full name?
[259:06.63]The webcam's like lagging.
[259:09.91]I don't like how the webcam's lagging.

[261:27.01]Thanks for the raid.
[261:36.81]I use the handgun so much that, like, why would I not upgrade it at least once?
[261:44.32]Right.
[261:53.52]Delighted to.
[261:56.96]And maybe... Power.
[261:58.82]It's just 140.
[262:03.94]That's not that much.
[262:07.16]Reload speed?
[262:08.14]No, that's not that much either.
[262:09.40]Eh, let's do power.
[262:10.36]These hands are more dexterous than one might think.
[262:20.07]I have 18,000.

[262:25.61]Uh, ammo capacity.

[263:20.72]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[263:23.16]Never buy something you can craft.
[263:28.64]Hey, where are you in this game?
[263:30.66]Don't sell it.
[263:32.44]Upgrade the sniper rifle.
[263:33.46]Wait, should I not sell this?
[263:36.34]Why would I not sell it?
[263:37.10]Can I use it somewhere?
[263:48.45]You need it later.
[263:50.85]You should.
[263:54.04]Chad is dumb.

[276:50.91]Oh, she had to restart her line.
[276:52.11]Grab the hood, pull it back, look right in her eyes.
[276:54.45]Remember me?
[277:11.18]How can a man be almost dead?
[277:13.96]Whatever.

[277:18.34]See, he did it though.
[277:19.16]You know what I mean.
[277:20.48]And I still haven't found Rose.
[277:22.22]Where did Mother Miranda take her?
[277:25.55]You're too late.
[277:27.79]Or maybe almost too late.
[277:31.67]The child will be sacrificed.
[277:33.59]Life for life.
[277:35.15]What kind of sick medieval shit is this?
[277:37.41]She's just a baby.
[277:39.88]She is not just a baby.
[277:40.95]It's only a riddle if you don't know the answer.
[277:43.79]Wait a second.
[277:44.41]That looks familiar.
[277:45.81]Why am I letting her just leave?
[277:47.73]Hey, hey, wait.
[278:09.35]Why not just swing, just roundhouse kick this lady in the face?
[278:14.95]And when she's like, on the ground, be like, where's the fucking baby?
[278:19.16]Tell me.
[278:27.98]Winged key.
[278:31.48]This is an evil witch, like warlock lady.
[278:35.84]She's like killing people.
[278:37.46]She literally is killing me.
[278:39.16]She tried to kill me that time.
[278:40.50]In the very beginning, remember she was like, scrape, scrape, scrape, slash!
[278:43.56]And she like slashed and killed like somebody.
[278:45.12]Is that the same person?
[278:50.42]That's the same person that like killed like a bunch of, there was a bad person, there was a bad person.
[278:55.64]That's not the same person.
[279:00.44]Didn't she like slash somebody with like a fucking magic wand?
[279:12.81]Whatever.
[279:17.51]It's a different person.
[279:28.14]It has human skulls on her step.
[279:30.22]I swear to God, in the very beginning of the game, she, like, was walking and tap-tap, and then she, like, slashed us.
[279:46.71]What is this?
[279:47.63]Oh.
[279:50.41]This looks great.
[279:52.87]And this doesn't even have RTX on because I'm afraid to overheat my computer.
[279:55.40]This pattern looks... Yeah, this is Umbrella.
[280:08.07]Wait, is this, like, implying that Umbrella has, like, existed for, like, 500 years or something?
[280:13.77]Wait, what year is it supposed to be?
[280:15.93]What year is this?
[280:23.43]What year is it?
[280:24.07]Is it supposed to be 2021?
[280:25.11]Oh.
[280:28.63]Um, do I have anything I can put here?
[280:34.12]I don't think so.
[280:50.82]Resident Evil 7 takes place in 2017.
[280:51.86]Oh, it doesn't.
[280:52.42]Come on.
[281:02.57]Oh my god!
[281:25.05]Alright, I need some more healing.
[281:30.61]I accidentally wasted a whole healing potion for no reason.
[281:34.15]It was really dumb.
[281:34.93]Where'd he go?
[281:36.41]Oh.
[281:39.86]I need to make some heals.
[281:47.54]Ooh!
[281:50.38]Magic goat.
[281:57.12]I still don't have whatever this thing is.
[282:00.90]That's been there from the very beginning of the whole game.
[282:12.26]Bill!
[282:13.58]Oh my god, Bill.
[282:14.90]Wait, I thought it was going to be like, who is that?
[282:17.42]Never mind, it's just a guy.
[282:35.53]Easy.
[282:45.10]Something... Alright, that's where the... little turn... tourniquet thing is.
[283:00.00]Um, I kind of don't want to leave yet.
[283:03.80]There's more money to be made.
[283:05.68]Yes, that's why I didn't want to leave.
[283:06.74]I told you.
[283:11.60]What?
[283:13.76]What is this?
[283:21.66]What?
[283:21.90]How do I not have that?
[283:33.40]It's annoying.
[283:33.86]This is tomato town, somebody said.
[283:41.21]This is tomato town.
[283:47.93]There you are.
[283:48.81]I had a feeling you would pop up here.
[283:52.79]It was all worthless.
[283:54.62]Is that so?
[283:56.14]I assume you've picked up something of value.
[283:59.68]Not sure if it's of value, but...
[284:03.85]Ah, the Jurassic Park mosquito.
[284:08.08]What are you saying?
[284:11.00]Take a closer look.
[284:18.00]Was that a liquifier?
[284:29.29]Rosemary's head?
[284:33.70]Her head's in there?
[284:34.46]That flask seems to contain her head.
[284:37.36]No.
[284:42.95]What?
[284:43.93]Rose is... Don't say another word!
[284:45.93]This... This is impossible.
[284:52.13]He dropped it.
[284:53.13]This just can't be!
[284:54.62]Your daughter's essence is still intact.
[284:58.16]Her powers are truly unique.
[285:04.49]Who could even do this?
[285:06.13]She can be saved, you know.
[285:08.35]Saved?
[285:09.67]From this?
[285:10.89]Are you insane?
[285:11.63]There's a house with a red chimney on the western side of the village.
[285:16.07]Go and seek out the man who lives there.
[285:18.79]Then we can continue our conversation.
[285:21.97]Quit holding out and get to the damn point.
[285:24.68]He lives there.
[285:25.34]You don't have to trust my words.
[285:28.76]But do you have any better options?
[285:36.59]Your choice.
[285:39.11]The customer is always right.
[285:42.35]After all.
[285:42.99]I'll give you 20 bucks if you drink pickle juice.
[285:47.51]I'll pay you if I find out this is a lie.
[285:50.57]Titans!
[285:51.21]I'll kill every one of them!
[286:06.85]What goes here?
[286:09.62]Well, I have a lot of stuff to sell.
[286:12.80]Louis Anderson.
[286:15.96]Ooh.
[286:16.26]Wow.
[286:16.60]25,000.
[286:16.68]Fish.
[286:31.77]Oh, Lady Dimitrescu.
[286:33.89]Beautiful even in death.
[286:35.97]That waistline, yes.
[286:38.25]He put something on that.
[286:39.22]He put a little twist at the end.
[286:40.62]Dimitrescu.
[286:43.06]Dimitrescu.
[286:43.84]Dimitrek.
[286:44.80]Dimitre, like Dimitrek.
[286:52.69]I think it's just kind of tomato-tomato at this point.
[287:03.01]There's another tier of upgrades?
[287:08.82]I'll take it.
[287:09.50]Alright, hold on.
[287:10.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[287:12.44]30,000 for extra baggage.
[287:13.82]Pipe bomb recipe.
[287:14.90]Pipe bombs, mines, rifle.
[287:19.24]Customizable part for sniper.
[287:20.36]Reduces weapon sway while aiming.
[287:21.93]I mean, should I even do this?
[287:31.63]Handgun ammo.
[287:36.31]You need handgun ammo.
[287:41.17]I have a lot.
[287:42.10]How much do I have?
[287:47.26]It's just a waste of money.
[287:56.55]One moment, please.
[288:02.72]Handgun's better.
[288:03.56]Do you have a typewriter?
[288:05.40]Yeah, you do.
[288:12.02]Hold the fish.
[288:14.38]That's the plan.
[288:15.02]Alright, go to that house over there.
[288:17.36]Up on that hill over there.
[288:22.19]Find the house with the red chimney.
[288:25.53]We gotta go this way.
[288:26.99]Find a house with a red chimney.
[288:40.37]Anything else?
[288:40.79]Did I miss anything?
[288:41.29]It's a decorated crest with four wings.
[288:54.04]Oh, you know what?
[288:54.70]I want to look at the baby thing.
[289:09.92]Specimen.
[289:17.09]Okay.
[289:19.71]Uh, I think the only door I can go in is the one that I'm currently going to.
[289:22.18]Yeah, okay.
[289:23.88]Let's go find the red chimney.
[289:25.36]I almost was like, oh, I found it!
[289:30.12]That's a red door.
[289:38.75]Load everything just in case I get collapsed on.
[289:43.46]You know, I do appreciate this game.
[289:44.62]Ooh.
[289:44.74]Ooh, okay, cool.
[289:47.54]We're going this way.
[289:48.28]Wait, ooh.
[289:51.02]Oh, this is the first area.
[289:52.02]Alright, let me go around and just start opening shit.
[289:53.88]Let's go this way.
[289:56.61]I like that they kind of went back to like the village era stuff.
[289:59.67]I like that.
[290:00.09]I think it's cool.
[290:00.51]Do I have any lockpicks?
[290:02.25]I don't think so.
[290:04.97]I do, actually.
[290:07.64]Reminds me of Resident Evil 4.
[290:08.56]It's like a first-person Resident Evil 4.
[290:09.88]Which is pretty cool.
[290:12.73]I like it.
[290:13.05]It said the game name.
[290:23.07]I did say the game name.
[290:23.89]You're right.
[290:24.16]That's seven bullets.
[290:25.02]Holy shit.
[290:25.60]Okay, that's good.
[290:27.92]Anything else in here?
[290:28.58]No.
[290:31.42]Play Postal 2.
[290:32.20]Postal 2, not Portal 2.
[290:34.50]What?
[290:36.19]I think you were talking to somebody in chat and I just answered.
[290:37.95]Alright.
[290:39.51]Wait, there's something else in there.
[290:42.57]What else could possibly be in here?
[290:53.07]Fabled monster, wolves of old, may they come eat our flesh.
[290:56.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[290:56.96]Is there a diamond in here?
[291:07.79]What am I missing?
[291:35.80]Oh, it's $500 under the bed.
[291:37.74]Okay, I got it.
[291:38.26]Clear.
[291:40.92]Alright, we're going to take a right.
[291:41.84]There's the house with the red... Alright, I found it.
[291:45.00]There it is.
[291:45.42]Is this an open?
[291:55.85]Okay, well, here's the house.
[292:03.70]Walk from the other side.
[292:04.70]Okay.
[292:05.38]Well, now what?
[292:06.68]What the fuck?
[292:11.06]Go all the way around?
[292:11.84]That was a pretty... The chimney was pretty... Okay.
[292:19.81]Settle down.
[292:20.23]Propane.
[292:22.39]Nope.
[292:29.98]Everything walked from the other side.
[292:38.49]What is that?
[292:38.91]Can I climb this?
[292:53.44]Where the hell do I go?
[292:55.78]Through here?
[293:00.37]Let's go.
[293:01.01]He's on the grind.
[293:07.25]I can't go that way.
[293:20.85]There's stuff in here.
[293:21.57]I heard a scream from the house with the chimney.
[293:24.13]I was going to take a look, but the way was blocked by debris.
[293:27.17]Going to have to take the long way around.
[293:29.71]Who would have thought the hole in the stable walls would come in handy?
[293:39.58]If I'm not back by morning, you should go to Louise's house.
[293:43.52]Hole in the stable walls.
[293:46.26]He said portal makes him feel sick.
[293:47.44]It does.
[293:49.84]Oh, it does.
[293:50.38]It makes me feel like shit when I play it.
[293:58.55]Debris.
[294:01.05]How would you say it?
[294:02.53]Debris.
[294:03.81]The different debris.
[294:05.11]Debris.
[294:07.33]Debris.
[294:17.23]Wooden animal body.
[294:19.23]Uh, is the plural of debris, debris?
[294:21.15]Or is it just debris?
[294:22.03]Debris.
[294:26.52]Debris.
[294:28.04]You're lucky I didn't say Debris to make you all fucking flip out.
[294:30.84]Okay, that's a little shortcut.
[294:35.72]Good.
[294:35.92]What's in here?
[294:41.22]Anything?
[294:41.76]There is...
[294:50.48]Anything?
[295:04.55]Nope.
[295:04.73]Okay.
[295:07.53]We need to go to the house with the chimney.
[295:10.92]And seek out the raven or whatever his name is.
[295:14.16]Could possibly move this somehow.
[295:20.40]I can move the tractor with something.
[295:32.27]What's this doing here?
[295:33.61]What is that doing there?
[295:39.18]Crazy frog moment.
[295:50.40]Do not enter.
[295:52.62]Do not enter.
[295:53.30]Crazy frogs.
[295:58.46]Workshop.
[295:59.90]Well.
[296:00.24]What's in the workshop?
[296:05.83]What's going on?
[296:07.95]I love that so much.
[296:08.87]It's like my favorite thing in the world.
[296:12.25]What's going on is my favorite sound effect, I think.
[296:21.09]It's up there.
[296:21.83]It could be... It's really high, whatever it is.
[296:25.60]Uh, this is a guy... This is like Iron Man.
[296:34.04]Look out the window.
[296:34.88]Oh!
[296:42.35]Which one?
[296:42.77]There's three.
[296:50.82]Is it four thousand?
[296:57.20]Oh no, this is the escape room.
[297:03.65]Look out the window.
[297:05.95]Oh four.
[297:23.05]Sorry.
[297:30.19]Sometimes it gets a little weird like that.
[297:31.53]Okay, 04.
[297:31.65]We got 07.
[297:32.23]07, 04, 08.
[297:32.53]Is that it?
[297:32.91]07, 0... How many numbers are there?
[297:35.28]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[297:35.48]There's 6 numbers.
[297:38.76]So it's 07, 04, 08.
[298:06.84]open and it is an m1911 and a Jack handle that's a new weapon hold on a second fully automatic handgun this thing's fucking awesome alright I want to put this equip this
[298:35.21]Shortcut to here.
[298:42.12]This is it.
[298:42.62]Nice.
[298:42.88]Okay, cool.
[298:47.16]Holy automatic?
[298:49.12]It is... Whoa, what?
[298:50.34]That's weird.
[298:50.82]I don't know if I'm going to like this.
[298:53.78]I'm not sure I'm going to actually like this.
[299:05.79]Alright, let's go back to the well over here.
[299:19.06]What?
[299:25.75]Shoot him!
[299:26.23]Shoot somebody!
[299:27.77]What am I doing?
[299:46.36]I don't notice my voice is going like a lot recently.
[299:51.58]You notice that?
[299:54.64]When I get really excited, it's like I don't know.
[299:58.28]What's going on?
[299:58.66]I think I'm getting older.
[299:59.24]I need some kind of item.
[300:06.46]I think I have one.
[300:08.36]I need some other item.
[300:09.64]Don't I have one?
[300:10.18]It's like it's the Jack, right?
[300:11.56]Don't I have the Jack?
[300:18.80]This seems like some kind of other item.
[300:20.24]I don't understand.
[300:33.57]Oh.
[300:33.75]Maybe it's for the tractor.
[300:38.45]Yeah, it probably is for the tractor.
[300:39.99]You're right.
[300:40.25]Alright, let's go.
[300:43.49]It's locked from the other side.
[300:44.90]Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[300:53.94]I'll get out.
[300:55.48]Alright, this same guy is just following me and pretending to be dead in different places.
[301:02.68]I feel like I've seen this guy lying down dead.
[301:05.76]Like, at every other scene.
[301:15.52]Not anymore.
[301:24.33]What the fuck?
[301:25.09]The guy's fucking following me around.
[301:34.08]What the fuck?
[301:34.48]My girlfriend's sleeping.
[301:35.18]You woke her up.
[301:35.82]Dude, we watch together.
[301:38.74]What are you talking about?
[301:44.04]You're not watching together now, are you?
[301:49.18]These sounds are so loud.
[301:50.52]It's so loud, isn't it?
[301:52.28]This game's too loud for you guys.
[301:53.94]The big, strong, loud blow-up explosion noises happen all the time.
[301:57.12]I keep looking over here and I'm getting just drowned out.
[302:05.42]No, you know what it is?
[302:06.88]It's this.
[302:10.47]That's the problem.
[302:11.11]Okay, now I'm good.
[302:12.19]I'm good now.
[302:20.28]This can come back up.
[302:21.08]Alright.
[302:24.81]Turn on ray- Alright, I will turn ray tracing on.
[302:27.99]Like, in- I didn't even see this guy.
[302:29.75]Is that fully automatic?
[302:44.02]I wouldn't classify this as fully automatic.
[302:45.66]Alright.
[302:50.83]Go this way?
[302:51.68]Wait, hold on.
[302:52.22]Any items?
[303:01.52]No.
[303:04.19]It's fully, completely semi-automatic.
[303:12.27]It's fully, completely kind of semi-automatic.
[303:27.05]Realistically, I probably shouldn't even use it, though.
[303:28.79]Because this is more powerful.
[303:36.65]And until I upgrade it, it's probably not worth using the bullets with it, right?
[303:40.53]Theoretically.
[303:45.19]Are the animals nice in this game?
[303:53.52]Alright, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[303:54.60]It didn't even hurt me.
[303:55.52]I don't have to kill it.
[303:57.60]Do I have to kill it?
[303:58.66]Can I feed it?
[304:02.16]You're eating the blood?
[304:02.94]Is it good?
[304:07.90]It's a good pig.
[304:17.24]I pet him.
[304:22.14]He was just scared.
[304:22.88]Why would I shoot it?
[304:42.00]No, no, nothing in here.
[304:42.88]Whatever.
[304:43.14]Okay, well, I don't have any more lockpicks, so I gotta... Is there a chicken over there?
[304:52.64]Wait, why are these listed here?
[305:01.21]Why is there a chicken here?
[305:17.35]Alright, I need to go to the chimney house.
[305:18.83]Where is it?
[305:19.59]It's over here.
[305:20.37]Go this way.
[305:28.01]Alright, I gotta go back here.
[305:32.43]It's meat?
[305:33.19]Wait, I actually get meat from the pig?
[305:39.07]Really?
[305:39.31]Are you shitting me?
[305:43.73]Did I actually do that?
[305:52.06]Don't kill it.
[305:52.92]Is it actually health?
[305:57.16]You're not going to do the same thing, right?
[306:03.61]I don't want to kill the pig.
[306:09.37]It's going to give meat.
[306:12.05]Pick a BLT.
[306:15.73]I can't do it.
[306:16.55]I'll rather have a harder game.
[306:18.49]I can't do it.
[306:19.05]He's just hanging out.
[306:19.91]What did he do?
[306:22.47]What did he do wrong?
[306:32.84]He rammed you.
[306:33.76]No, I startled him and then he freaked out.
[306:36.64]He ran at me because he was scared.
[306:37.88]Alright, here we go.
[306:43.38]You're on the roof.
[306:43.98]You're on the roof.
[306:44.44]Okay.
[306:50.11]That actually... Does that make... Oh my god.
[306:57.51]Trying to shoot them both at the same time.
[307:06.83]He slipped.
[307:07.85]He just slipped and exploded his head on the ground.
[307:10.01]I feel like I didn't even do that.
[307:12.51]Alright, this is the house, right?
[307:19.28]No, it's not.
[307:23.80]Might as well just look around.
[307:29.23]Light bomb, good.
[307:32.85]You'll kill zombies, but you won't kill the pig.
[307:34.69]The zombies are actively attacking me to trying to kill me.
[307:38.53]The pig ran by me and screamed.
[307:51.68]If that pig kept attacking me, you better believe I would have... That guy looks a little different.
[308:03.08]Is that hurting him?
[308:15.59]Ah!
[308:22.86]Holy shit, that guy took a lot of hits.
[308:26.54]A perfect crystal skull.
[308:29.64]It's ManBearPig.
[308:37.54]What does that sign say?
[308:49.18]Locked due to missing homeowner.
[308:52.19]Hold on, not yet.
[308:54.69]Open this.
[308:55.15]Oh, where's the door closing?
[308:59.65]Was the door closing?
[309:00.47]Whatever.
[309:00.85]Okay, I want to open this.
[309:13.63]Use the fucking knife.
[309:14.65]I have guns.
[309:15.53]Why would I use a knife?
[309:20.01]Finally, I have the wheel.
[309:21.41]Well, it took long enough.
[309:22.55]It took five plus hours into the game to get this item.
[309:25.28]Alright, I'm gonna... I wanna go use it.
[309:36.10]Back here, right?
[309:42.67]Alright, there's one well here.
[309:44.13]Are there only two?
[309:45.51]There's three.
[309:47.15]Alright.
[309:47.45]I want to get all the wells.
[310:01.66]Wheel.
[310:04.73]Where is it?
[310:06.95]Where are you?
[310:07.63]That's where the pig is.
[310:11.73]This is wrong.
[310:16.85]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[310:20.29]Right?
[310:21.51]Yes.
[310:23.37]Underneath.
[310:23.71]We're gonna have to crawl underneath her.
[310:27.82]Kill the pig.
[310:28.38]I'm not killing the pig.
[310:29.62]It's not gonna happen.
[310:31.02]I'm not killing any of the animals unless they attack first.
[310:34.16]Except for the fish, because I thought they were mutants.
[310:46.78]Real well.
[310:50.04]And... Block pick.
[310:52.30]Okay, there's one.
[310:54.96]Wait, do I need to pick it back up?
[310:56.46]No.
[310:58.88]The second one is... This way.
[311:04.53]Can't open that.
[311:05.11]So where's the other one?
[311:08.51]If I go... Down and then to the right.
[311:16.01]I go this way.
[311:16.77]What's over?
[311:17.11]Did I?
[311:17.49]Did I do this?
[311:21.41]Yes, it did.
[311:27.35]Well, is over here.
[311:34.86]Down here.
[311:36.02]Well.
[311:40.86]Where is it?
[311:41.72]Where is that?
[311:42.36]Well, behind me.
[311:43.62]Yeah.
[311:51.22]Shotgun.
[311:52.82]Wooden head.
[311:53.79]Oh, I got the... I have a wooden body and a wooden head.
[311:56.51]Can I combine them?
[312:06.43]I can complete the wooden goat now.
[312:07.74]Okay, do it.
[312:10.74]Nice.
[312:12.00]Wooden goat.
[312:12.64]Very valuable.
[312:15.68]There's another one up here.
[312:19.60]Shit, I never would have done that, huh?
[312:33.56]Million channel points to turn the stream off.
[312:35.21]My stream would never turn back on ever again.
[312:42.81]Necklace with two holes.
[312:49.19]There is one more well this way.
[312:59.25]Five hours in and he's still in the first area.
[313:01.65]I like to take my time with the game.
[313:03.59]I don't want to rush it.
[313:06.17]I like to take my time.
[313:08.59]Yeah, I mean, this is like the first zone.
[313:10.33]I didn't... I heard that there's like a big lady or something.
[313:14.63]Like, I'm looking forward to that.
[313:15.71]But I take my time in games.
[313:19.41]Is that something that's... Was that bad?
[313:20.89]Because I'm taking my time?
[313:22.01]I hear a person.
[313:24.37]Where are they?
[313:24.71]Shit, where is it?
[313:29.50]Oh my god, I don't know where he is.
[313:31.22]Oh my god, I don't know where he is!
[313:32.30]Oh, it's... Oh my god, the fucking Wizard of Oz bats, whatever they are.
[313:48.15]Oh, they're everywhere.
[313:50.60]I just want to... Alright, just run.
[313:51.76]That was 1,200 bucks.
[313:52.82]What?
[314:05.47]I just, I... What's that?
[314:11.47]What's that?
[314:11.95]What is that?
[314:12.87]What's that?
[314:15.12]Necklace.
[314:15.44]Fuck.
[314:24.82]Leave it.
[314:25.22]Leave it.
[314:25.88]Close the door.
[314:47.12]Oh, God, God, God, God.
[314:51.22]Is he in the bathroom with me?
[314:55.18]Can I get the money through the wall?
[314:56.08]I don't know.
[314:56.70]A crystal wing.
[314:57.24]Got it.
[315:05.34]I'm going to make a shitload of money.
[315:06.98]Oh, my God.
[315:07.42]This is so much money.
[315:08.14]Okay.
[315:10.24]I need to get through here.
[315:11.84]Can I climb this?
[315:12.96]Why does it say I can go through that?
[315:16.22]That's weird, right?
[315:23.39]Explosive rounds.
[315:25.95]I'm really glad I came here.
[315:26.95]This looks like there's a wall here.
[315:36.76]I want... Maybe... Can I... Magnum ammo?
[315:41.50]Holy shit.
[315:42.46]Where's the magnum?
[315:45.04]Alright, I gotta run.
[315:46.08]I don't even know where the hell this is.
[315:47.25]Can I actually bait?
[315:51.13]Can I go through the shed?
[315:57.01]Where's the fucking shed?
[315:57.77]Oh my god, I... I'm like Map Andy.
[316:01.19]I just keep pressing the map.
[316:02.48]Where am I, map?
[316:03.14]Map, where am I?
[316:03.72]Where's the map, map?
[316:04.32]Where am I, map?
[316:04.80]Alright, that's just a pig.
[316:07.60]I don't kill pigs.
[316:11.10]Don't kill pigs.
[316:18.80]He's fine.
[316:19.58]He's fine.
[316:21.16]Stop.
[316:21.58]He's gonna try and kill me.
[316:29.50]He's fine.
[316:30.30]It was not... He's fine.
[316:41.10]He's fine.
[316:42.92]He's walking around talking and... Wait, there's something on the table.
[316:51.44]Stop it!
[316:51.84]Do you actually get meat for doing this?
[317:03.98]I...
[317:09.49]I'm sorry.
[317:10.61]I'm sorry.
[317:11.15]I'm sorry.
[317:11.59]I'm sorry.
[317:13.13]I'm sorry.
[317:13.45]I'm sorry.
[317:13.77]I'm sorry.
[317:14.09]Oh, I hate it.
[317:16.07]Okay, quality meat.
[317:19.23]Give these to the Duke.
[317:20.25]I had to do that.
[317:23.11]Oh, I hate that.
[317:23.61]I'm not doing that again.
[317:25.00]I didn't like that.
[317:26.92]I did not enjoy that.
[317:28.16]I didn't like that at all.
[317:31.02]Alright.
[317:33.68]The idea... I gotta go this way.
[317:34.82]At least I picked up a bunch of shit.
[317:37.18]Nice.
[317:47.20]Get the chicken, too.
[317:56.96]Can I get the chicken?
[317:57.58]Holy shit, there are chickens.
[318:08.99]I just clotheslined him.
[318:22.91]I don't want to do that.
[318:24.17]I hate this.
[318:25.38]I hate it.
[318:25.90]I don't like doing this.
[318:27.94]Alright, no more.
[318:29.04]I can live off of this for the next like 10 years.
[318:31.44]Okay, map Andy.
[318:37.26]We're going up.
[318:41.63]No.
[318:44.57]Where's this stupid house?
[318:45.47]Okay.
[318:53.94]It can open this door.
[318:58.84]What's back here?
[318:59.46]Okay.
[319:11.27]I feel like I'm getting a ton of collectibles and tons of money and stuff.
[319:17.90]So this is not a bad what I'm doing.
[319:25.56]Walk from the other side, okay?
[319:30.88]You're collecting meat.
[319:33.97]Sort of, yeah.
[319:38.77]Andy.
[319:39.47]Andy.
[319:41.83]My name is...
[319:49.07]Need the meat.
[319:49.53]I just have to.
[319:50.09]Whatever.
[319:50.33]I'm doing it.
[319:52.45]I give it to the guy.
[319:53.19]The guy like I can make like chicken stuff.
[319:54.85]And I can make chicken.
[319:55.73]Stop.
[320:17.05]You're making him cry.
[320:23.74]Okay.
[320:25.20]No more.
[320:26.62]I got all the stuff.
[320:27.80]I have so much stuff now.
[320:31.39]I'll come back and do that later for something.
[320:33.23]Whatever it is.
[320:33.77]I got all the... Alright.
[320:35.59]Now we have to go back to the house with the red chimney.
[320:38.91]That's the goal.
[320:39.47]That's what we're doing.
[320:40.15]That's what I'm doing.
[320:40.81]I'm going to the house with the red chimney.
[320:42.01]That's what I'm doing.
[320:42.61]The house with the red chimney is... Fuck.
[320:47.46]I don't know.
[320:50.50]Looks like we have to go back this way.
[320:52.90]It's blocked by trees.
[320:54.20]We have to go over here.
[321:01.42]No, back through the church, through the door, down here.
[321:05.36]It's confusing.
[321:07.78]It is.
[321:21.41]What's this?
[321:24.37]It's confusing if you can't read a map.
[321:31.13]Look, dude.
[321:32.27]It's like half of these things are blocked.
[321:35.34]Half of them are blocked by... I'm playing a maze here.
[321:38.44]You have to just... Step by step.
[321:41.18]It's difficult.
[321:42.56]It's not easy to read this.
[321:48.06]Half of these roads are blocked.
[321:50.18]Look, man.
[321:50.62]Alright, I'm going...
[321:56.06]Down here.
[321:57.90]And then like around here and through here.
[322:00.50]Okay.
[322:01.74]Straight ahead.
[322:02.18]Let's go.
[322:02.46]And it doesn't look like the same thing.
[322:06.74]Wait.
[322:07.06]Look.
[322:07.30]It's blocked.
[322:09.34]It's blocked up.
[322:10.47]Okay.
[322:10.71]So now I can't go this way.
[322:12.89]Read the map, Andy.
[322:13.81]Right?
[322:14.25]It's blocked.
[322:20.31]Half of them are locked from the other side.
[322:21.75]Okay.
[322:26.48]This is locked.
[322:37.45]I gotta go through here.
[322:38.55]And then like... Where the fuck am I going?
[322:54.99]I have to get back to, like, the place with the pig.
[323:03.46]In some places, you have to go through houses.
[323:05.24]Okay, hold on.
[323:07.46]Can I, like, get through this way?
[323:11.04]No, what?
[323:15.94]I... Alright, I'm going down this way and...
[323:27.81]How do I, how did I get here?
[323:29.22]Through here, through here, this is blocked.
[323:34.74]I gotta go down, I can't go through here.
[323:36.91]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[323:40.65]Is he high or something?
[323:41.51]This map is fucking, this map is dog shit.
[323:48.76]You can't give me a shit map and then be like, well, how come we didn't go to the birthday party?
[323:52.96]It's because your directions were fucking terrible.
[323:54.86]Remember back like 20 years ago, 15 years ago?
[323:58.08]Those of you that drove like 20 years ago, 15 years ago, before GPS, people used to give you the most absurd directions.
[324:07.59]Oh, at the fourth light, you'll look over, there'll be a clown.
[324:10.21]Take a left at the clown and there's no clown.
[324:12.67]There's absolutely no fucking clown.
[324:14.85]And there's like 12 lights and you don't know which one to take the left at.
[324:18.53]I remember looking at directions that were written out.
[324:21.29]It was like 75 steps.
[324:22.33]Alright.
[324:37.99]I can't go this way.
[324:39.61]This is locked.
[324:46.80]Can I like go through here?
[324:48.64]And like out there?
[324:51.06]Where do I go?
[324:52.14]How do I get out of here?
[324:54.10]I'm fucking trapped.
[324:56.97]I'm trapped here.
[325:03.09]There's one little specific route I have to take through this fucking map.
[325:13.32]You keep turning at the clown.
[325:14.86]There is no clown.
[325:16.80]This way?
[325:17.28]No.
[325:20.88]And I would love to zoom out, but I can't.
[325:22.50]Everything disappears.
[325:23.58]Alright, settle down.
[325:25.85]Relax.
[325:33.47]I am gonna lose my mind.
[325:34.81]How do I get over here?
[325:39.41]I can't go this way.
[325:41.37]Do I have to go straight?
[325:44.57]And then... Right?
[325:47.25]And then... Back to where you got the wheel.
[325:50.67]I have no idea where that is.
[325:54.74]Right from where you are now.
[325:58.82]It's blocked off with a fucking wagon.
[326:06.72]Flying back under the tractor.
[326:08.48]I don't even know where that fucking tractor is, man.
[326:16.17]Oh.
[326:20.41]Oh shit, there's a fucking diamond in here.
[326:22.17]Teddy bear?
[326:26.11]I hit the jackpot down here.
[326:28.49]Okay, now... Look at the statue.
[326:48.00]Nice.
[326:49.82]There's the red chimney.
[327:07.54]Left of the wagon?
[327:40.30]Where the, where, somebody hack my computer and just do it for me!
[328:05.66]Oh!
[328:10.86]Why is it this confusing?
[328:12.55]This should just be able to walk down a path.
[328:16.65]Why can't I just walk down a path?
[328:19.72]Go through the shack?
[328:36.65]This shit isn't even on the map!
[328:39.17]It's not even on the map!
[328:47.56]Okay, alright!
[328:49.02]Great!
[328:55.14]Now I gotta go... ...through this shit... ...and then, like, back around this... AHH!
[329:08.06]I'm gonna shock out of... No, I'm not.
[329:09.56]Relax.
[329:19.60]I just walked around in like three circles.
[329:21.46]If I could just walk just over here.
[329:22.86]Oh, above that.
[329:27.03]And I just slide under there.
[329:28.07]And go through the shack.
[329:30.69]Through the door.
[329:34.03]Through the window!
[329:34.71]Oh, I've got through the window!
[329:36.59]Through the door!
[329:48.12]Okay.
[329:48.72]Oh, wha- I fucking made it!
[329:52.14]I- I can't even go in this door.
[329:53.44]I can't even go in here.
[329:55.50]Oh my god.
[329:57.71]What is- where- And climb up the ladder.
[330:02.59]Your ski!
[330:29.94]What's even in here?
[330:30.81]Relax.
[331:08.22]Wait, do I have to go back around and get on the ladder again?
[331:10.72]Go through the house.
[331:20.24]Everything's just confusing me.
[331:21.45]I'm so confused right now.
[331:23.05]Every door is locked from the- How many fucking doors are locked from the other side?
[331:29.81]Half of the shit in this game is locked.
[331:31.39]Everything's locked.
[331:32.15]What are these people doing in their houses?
[331:41.10]Give me that crystal.
[331:49.69]I'm just throwing a fucking grenade into the chimney.
[331:55.33]Alright, I made it.
[331:56.01]I'm in your house.
[332:05.94]Who's in here?
[332:20.29]Do you not lock your door?
[332:21.39]I- What the f- Every door is locked from the other side.
[332:28.17]Everything's locked from the other side.
[332:31.07]Okay, is somebody- I'm so- I'm so- Where is this person?
[332:34.21]Oh my fucking god, it's gonna be like another- The wing key is just a single piece.
[332:40.31]Three more parts are needed to make it whole.
[332:42.41]Oh no.
[332:45.81]The wing key is just one single piece.
[332:48.03]Three more parts are needed.
[332:51.10]Combined with the winged key.
[332:52.50]I don't even know what I just did.
[332:55.89]Oh, God.
[332:56.23]I have to leave.
[332:57.77]I have to leave.
[333:01.49]I have to get out of the house.
[333:02.71]I have to go back to the Duke.
[333:07.26]Who is over here.
[333:08.68]Oh, this is simple.
[333:09.30]Just walk out the door.
[333:18.76]Where's he?
[333:19.02]This way?
[333:19.22]Over here.
[333:21.44]Alright.
[333:21.78]I'm good.
[333:24.41]God, you're an idiot.
[333:25.49]This map sucks.
[333:26.79]This game sucks.
[333:28.37]I'm kidding.
[333:28.83]It's a joke.
[333:29.35]Relax, everybody.
[333:33.91]How was it?
[333:34.93]Did you learn anything?
[333:37.57]I found these feathers.
[333:38.93]Now tell me how to fix this like you said you would.
[333:41.33]Settle down.
[333:41.81]I'm kidding.
[333:42.19]The game's fun.
[333:42.77]First, you must use that key and collect all of your little roses flasks.
[333:48.12]Where are the rest of them?
[333:50.48]There are four in total.
[333:52.50]You have the one, and the other lords have the rest.
[333:56.59]Lords?
[334:01.49]Mother Miranda is the cold, calculating ruler of this village.
[334:06.17]Four lords serve under her.
[334:10.01]The first you've already met, the Lady de Mitresque.
[334:13.31]Mitresque?
[334:15.81]The second lives deep in a valley of mist, the doll maker, Donna Beneviento.
[334:23.34]Getting the hub world.
[334:23.96]None of her playmates have ever come back from that dank old estate.
[334:32.32]The third is Moreau, a being of twisted flesh that lives in the reservoir past the windmills.
[334:38.49]He's pretty weak.
[334:39.17]Just one shotgun blast to his face will do it.
[334:40.65]He said that he is not the only monster that lives in those waters.
[334:47.83]Okay.
[334:48.01]So... Okay, so we already claimed Lady de McQuay.

[337:27.70]Gun Smitty.
[337:28.34]Alright, so this is 150 power.
[337:31.32]This is 160 power base.
[337:35.22]I'm going to get the suitcase.
[337:39.66]Sorry, speaking to myself there.
[337:42.63]Okay.
[337:43.37]So this is 170 now.
[337:44.99]Yeah, I'm going to use this.
[337:56.34]Let's do ammo capacity.
[337:57.58]Get it up there.
[338:00.16]Nine.
[338:00.68]Reload speed.
[338:01.54]Rate of fire.
[338:02.12]The rate of fire is fine.
[338:03.02]Let's do reload speed.
[338:04.06]Leave everything to me.
[338:11.89]Okay, and he probably has something else I want, right?
[338:19.18]Oh, there we go.
[338:19.76]That's cool.
[338:24.24]Should I sell the pistol, the other one?
[338:31.15]Alright, so this one is just... I'm going to... Wait, should I take the recoil off?
[338:36.85]No.

[338:52.73]The Duke's Kitchen.
[338:55.21]You kill it, we cook it.
[339:00.67]Oh, shit.
[339:02.49]This is permanent health increases?
[339:05.01]This is permanent stuff.
[339:07.67]Why would I not kill every animal?
[339:13.29]Damage taken when guarding decreases permanently.
[339:15.97]Increases health permanently.
[339:21.49]Oh, my God.
[339:22.44]I can't believe that.
[339:23.52]I was so concerned about, like, killing the pig.
[339:28.52]Alright.
[339:28.90]Well, let's do this one because I can make it.
[339:31.30]Okay.
[339:37.59]Two, two, right?
[339:38.93]Yes.
[339:39.11]Yes.
[339:42.62]We've gathered all the ingredients.
[339:44.44]Health slightly increased permanently.
[339:45.96]Now.
[339:57.20]Apologies for the wait.
[339:58.60]Here's your share.
[340:02.33]Sounds like he kind of just ate that in front of me.
[340:05.53]Not a bad dish.
[340:08.29]Okay, so now...
[340:11.79]Poultry, meat.
[340:12.75]Okay, we just kill animals.
[340:14.41]That's all I need to know.
[340:15.05]Alright, cool.
[340:15.51]We're going to increase the rate of fire on this.
[340:21.50]No, we don't.
[340:22.80]Shotgun.
[340:23.64]Ammo capacity on the shotgun.
[340:25.10]Yes.
[340:26.46]And reload speed.
[340:27.20]Thank you.
[340:28.82]And let's make the sniper rifle more powerful.
[340:30.80]Yes.
[340:33.09]Sounds good to me.
[340:33.55]You know what?
[340:34.07]I'm just going to buy a shitload.
[340:35.01]Just give me more rounds.
[340:43.87]Whatever, I don't care.
[340:49.09]Thank you.
[340:49.39]Uh, I need to do some organization here.
[340:57.98]I gotta pee, though.
[340:58.78]I'll be right back.
[340:59.62]Pee time.
[343:59.25]Alright.
[344:02.27]So.
[344:07.19]Does anybody know?
[344:09.43]I'm assuming I'm probably almost at the halfway point of the game.
[344:13.60]If I do one of these areas and I get two of four, I'm assuming that's probably somewhere around halfway.
[344:21.08]Maybe.
[344:28.32]So if I get another piece of rose, and that would be somewhere, would that be 33%?
[344:36.31]Let's, let's, we're going, here's what we're going to do.
[344:41.53]That'd be about 40%.
[344:44.50]Okay.
[344:56.12]Lady Dimitrescu is about third of the way through the game.
[344:58.43]Alright, so I'm going to get one more piece of rose.
[345:02.85]From one of these areas.
[345:04.31]And then we'll see where we are.
[345:05.37]But we'll finish it tomorrow.
[345:08.22]Alright, let me fix my inventory.
[345:12.84]What's this?
[345:15.37]Oh shit, this is the extra space.
[345:16.77]Nice.
[345:16.99]Alright, well we're going to put weapons over here.
[345:26.84]All guns, all weapons, all ammo.
[345:29.58]No?
[345:29.88]What are you doing?
[345:33.62]Oh.
[345:34.54]Okay.
[345:37.04]That's just to organize.
[345:37.98]I thought it was an extra backpack.
[345:45.31]First of all, let me re... Wait, are my weapons all gone?
[345:49.97]Let me reload everything.
[345:54.23]Everything reloaded?
[345:55.29]Yes.
[345:55.47]Alright.
[345:57.40]Okay.
[345:57.56]So we're going to do weapons down here.
[346:03.56]Weapons on the right.
[346:04.62]That sounds good to me.
[346:13.29]Okay.
[346:13.55]Okay.
[346:16.81]Kite bombs up here.
[346:17.99]The knife will spin it this way up here.
[346:19.77]This game's really good.
[346:21.91]I like this game a lot.
[346:23.73]Turn off your lights.
[346:24.83]No, but you won't be able to see me.
[346:27.82]It'll be just dark.
[346:30.44]Lights off.
[346:31.00]You're not going to be able to even see me.
[346:40.83]You don't want it like this.
[346:42.63]This sucks.
[346:45.37]And this sucks to play.
[346:47.87]I don't like this at all, actually.
[346:49.35]I hate this.
[346:54.20]This is good.
[346:54.74]It's not good because I'm playing a video game in a dark room.
[346:58.43]no I'm putting it back on I'm putting no no we're not doing that it's scare saturdays yes I know
[347:18.70]Alright, let me get back to this.
[347:19.58]I really like this game.
[347:20.54]I'm going to give this game an 8.6 right now.
[347:23.56]At this stage right now.
[347:25.30]It would be like an 8.9 or like an 8.8 at the moment if the FOV was scalable.
[347:30.95]And if I didn't just get stuck and beg somebody to fucking help me.
[347:35.25]An 8.6 at the moment.
[347:37.63]It's really bad for your eyes.
[347:38.45]Yeah, I know it is.
[347:38.95]It's horrible for you.
[347:39.53]It's like really horrible for you.
[347:40.25]It's bad for your brain.
[347:40.95]Alright, handgun.
[347:45.01]With the handgun.
[347:45.81]Shotgun.
[347:46.25]With the shotgun.
[347:46.82]Shotgun.
[347:53.15]Shotgun.
[347:53.67]With the shotgun, of course.
[347:57.59]Handgun with the handgun.
[348:00.69]This is magnum.
[348:01.30]I don't have a magnum, but whatever, I guess.
[348:06.44]We'll put the health in the top right.
[348:10.88]Meat down here.
[348:11.60]Magnum ammo.
[348:13.64]It's going to go with the pistol, just because.
[348:15.20]Why not?
[348:16.36]Lockpicks up here.
[348:17.30]Explosive rounds up here.
[348:21.55]Right here.
[348:22.19]Yeah, right here.
[348:23.67]Much better.
[348:24.17]Alright.
[348:24.39]I like it.
[348:24.67]Good.
[348:24.77]Good.
[348:28.53]What is this?
[348:29.45]Sniper ammo?
[348:29.93]I don't have any.
[348:36.60]Clean.
[348:36.80]This is clean.
[348:37.32]Wait.
[348:37.54]Hold on.
[348:42.69]That's better.
[348:43.07]I like that better.
[348:43.61]Okay.
[348:46.99]Up right?
[348:47.91]What about...
[348:51.33]I have a magnum.
[348:56.03]What?
[348:58.53]Where's my magnum?
[348:59.05]I don't have a magnum.
[349:06.34]Okay.
[349:07.64]That's better.
[349:08.46]Where should I go?
[349:09.42]There's a treasure over here.
[349:15.64]Peaceful Hayley just gave 10 community subs.
[349:18.76]Thanks for the community subs, Peaceful Hayley.
[349:21.21]Sorry, I said that like, let me do that better.
[349:23.67]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[349:26.65]I'm not turning my... I promised I wasn't going to get angry today.
[349:31.97]I already broke that promise like three times.
[349:33.49]Alright.
[349:37.60]Who do I want to go to?
[349:40.06]I kind of want to go to like the weird little doll thing.
[349:43.72]That's where I want to go.
[349:44.44]I want to go to the doll.
[349:52.64]Turn RTX on.
[349:53.54]I will before the stream turns off, I promise.
[349:55.58]Inkcat, thanks for the five.
[349:56.72]Give me 30 subs.
[349:58.40]You know it.
[350:01.21]So, that is up here?
[350:07.67]Or down here?
[350:09.67]I'm assuming it's probably just up this way.
[350:14.03]This way.
[350:16.40]Dim the lights.
[350:16.98]I don't have a dimmer.
[350:20.08]I can't dim my lights.
[350:29.28]This is a good game, though.
[350:30.16]I like this a lot.
[350:32.16]So far, this is better than Resident Evil 7.
[350:36.90]If I were to give you a comparison so far.
[350:40.30]Resident Evil 7 was really fun for the first, like, two or three hours, and then I kind of just thought the game was boring.
[350:47.48]This has been consistently still pretty good.
[350:48.94]Alright, here we go.
[350:52.56]We're going towards this little doll thing.
[350:57.82]I'm going to get attacked by dolls, aren't I?
[351:00.20]I thought that was a stormtrooper helmet.
[351:20.06]Like right here.
[351:24.78]I'm not turning my lights off.
[351:28.26]No, lights stay on.
[351:42.13]Ethan.
[351:44.07]What?
[351:50.47]Ethan, come with me.
[351:52.87]There's something I have to tell you.
[351:54.24]Mia?
[351:55.02]Mia!
[351:56.24]What's going on?
[351:57.88]What's going on?
[351:58.62]I don't want to miss that treasure.
[352:07.21]Don't let me miss that treasure.
[352:14.85]Don't open.
[352:17.39]Rose feels different.
[352:20.57]Ethan, you have to fix her.
[352:23.41]Okay, I'll try.
[352:24.55]What the heck, dude?
[352:27.56]What the heck is this?
[352:28.44]Don't be so fucking offensive to me.
[352:29.76]Irma, invest in a lamp, you absolute man.
[352:33.12]I don't want recessed lighting.
[352:33.98]I don't want a lamp.
[352:36.57]Alright, here's the treasure.
[352:57.60]A. Beneviento.
[353:00.74]1987 to 1996.
[353:01.84]Freed from the binds of flesh, she now walks the valley of death.
[353:06.06]Okay.
[353:11.24]Beneviento's treasure.
[353:15.66]Am I losing it?
[353:16.72]I don't think I can open this yet.
[353:22.72]I can't open that.
[353:23.56]I think it probably opens when I kill Beneviento.
[353:38.75]Put it in the mail slot?
[353:44.07]What's going on?
[353:45.39]What the fuck?
[353:47.21]Okay, that was very strange.
[353:50.53]Here, I'll do this.
[353:51.95]I'm gonna, like, make it so the, uh... Let me just change this so, like, the... It's not gonna... Ready?
[354:01.07]I'll darken it.
[354:09.16]There, I'm making some people go, okay, alright, finally, finally, we can see.
[354:12.40]Now, well, that's just making me look like, it's like turning into a silhouette.
[354:25.20]Should I be, hold on, ready?
[354:29.82]Hold on, give me a second.
[354:33.15]I'm like one of those people that's just like blacked out doing one of those interviews, but they don't want you to know who they are.
[354:38.33]But I'm streaming.
[354:39.61]I'm a streamer.
[354:40.22]I just don't want you to know.
[354:46.74]Okay, so... Let's take a quick... Hold on a second.
[355:09.17]Okay.
[355:12.73]That sounds pretty good.
[355:13.47]Imagine watching... Imagine watching this fucking stream, hold on.
[355:31.92]Uh, like for privacy purposes.
[355:46.66]That's good.
[355:47.10]Okay.
[356:08.90]I'm just going to stream like this.
[356:18.78]Alright, so... Let's go ahead and head down this hallway here.
[356:32.61]You know, I really would tell you more about my boss.
[356:35.56]My boss, really, he was a fucking tyrant.
[356:38.96]And I'm not just saying that because we're playing Resident Evil...
[356:45.05]He really was a tyrant.
[356:45.99]He was a terrible guy.
[356:48.53]We're not going to use this anywhere, right?
[356:49.99]Are you going to make sure nobody can hear me?
[356:51.41]Go hit that follow button if you could.
[357:02.08]Holy shit.
[357:08.26]Those lights just flickered.
[357:09.52]Holy shit, man.
[357:10.42]That was crazy.
[357:18.69]Nothing gonna happen?
[357:26.53]Wait, wait, I don't wanna miss anything.
[357:27.97]Come on, I gotta get those items.
[357:30.63]I gotta get those items, man.
[357:37.20]Why is this happening?
[357:39.00]I'm just making sure that I get protected, because... It was part of a potential... There was 45 gold bars were stolen.
[357:47.97]I watched it happen.
[357:49.75]And I know who did it.
[357:51.53]And I'm just gonna be careful.
[358:01.41]Okay, what do we got here?
[358:10.14]Stringer on the ground.
[358:16.36]Aaron?
[358:16.72]Aaron!
[358:17.51]Aaron!
[358:17.83]Aaron!
[358:20.47]Oh shit, you don't even know who I am!
[358:24.53]No, uh, what I meant to say was... No, I just, you don't know who I am, I'm the secret streamer.
[358:39.59]Somebody's shadow right there.
[358:48.02]Who's the secret shriever?
[358:50.20]That's so stupid.
[358:57.79]I don't want anybody to know who the fuck I am.
[359:00.53]Are you kidding me?
[359:02.17]I'll be dead.

[363:10.95]Gorge, Bicky.
[363:11.93]Uh-oh, Crack Era's back.

[363:42.23]I have a plan.
[363:43.39]Don't you tell me, Arthur, what we can't do.
[363:48.15]It's just everybody's, I've already did this before.
[363:54.32]Hey, Jimmy, I've done this before.
[363:55.88]We've already been here before.
[363:56.98]And I, it's not, you don't even know who the fuck I am.
[364:01.01]How many times do I have to do this bit?
[364:02.85]It's like I get, we're like in a time loop.
[364:08.19]Okay.
[364:08.37]Can I open that?
[364:10.41]No.
[364:16.57]This looks like the Resident Evil house from the first game.
[364:20.31]Is that an herb?
[364:33.50]No.
[364:33.84]Oh, it's that thing.
[364:34.62]It's that corn.
[364:48.67]What is that?
[364:51.27]It's the little doll lady.
[364:52.61]Uh-oh.
[364:58.64]I've been waiting for so long.
[365:03.06]I need a much better daughter than Rose.
[365:06.60]Please, won't you stay with me forever?
[365:11.66]This bit is over.
[365:12.20]I'm going back to playing the video game.
[365:14.37]Thank you very much.
[365:43.43]Wait, hold on.
[365:46.63]Wait a minute.
[365:49.73]What did I just do?
[365:50.63]What just happened?
[365:57.45]I think I broke the webcam.
[365:58.39]I can't, like, change it anymore.
[366:01.97]None of my changes are doing anything.
[366:05.31]Oh, God.
[366:16.57]You see, the movement just sucks.
[366:24.48]I look like I'm... Why do I look so weird?
[366:31.42]I look like strange, don't I?
[366:34.16]Get an actual camera.
[366:35.64]It's not my fault that every webcam has the same technology from, like, 2003.
[366:40.82]Okay?
[366:45.04]Is that really my fault?
[366:51.19]You want me to get a DSLR and, like, have my room heat up by, like, another 500%?
[366:55.05]I'm gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna, I'm gonna be hot-boxed out of here.
[366:59.05]Hey, Jimmy!
[367:03.14]Oh, it doesn't work anymore.
[367:04.06]I found the key.
[367:22.98]Where are my items?
[367:25.82]Where are my weapons?
[367:26.40]Wait, the actual escape room.
[367:35.35]It really actually is an escape room.
[367:37.87]Okay, well that's funny.
[367:46.68]I have the key.
[367:47.28]I have to... Oh my god.
[367:49.40]Okay, that's pretty...
[367:53.08]Alright.
[367:54.70]What else can I do?
[367:55.20]Do I have to remove any legs or anything?
[368:02.09]Why don't you stay and play with me forever?
[368:13.59]Deadly nerve agent.
[368:16.60]Ring.
[368:16.92]Eye.
[368:20.18]Am I taking eyes out?
[368:21.16]Alright, we'll just pull over.

[368:46.33]You need to cut them.
[368:49.70]Oh, shut up.
[368:51.86]I don't need to cut them.
[368:59.59]Anything else?
[369:00.11]Can I pull anything else off?
[369:02.89]I pull the arm off?
[369:05.37]Remove arm.
[369:12.84]Um.
[369:16.72]OK, I waited to close the eyes.
[369:18.38]Wait, what the hell was that?
[369:24.86]It's three closed eyes.
[369:31.56]Anything else?
[369:31.90]What about the leg?

[387:29.68]Is there gonna be a baby in here?
[387:36.97]There's not, right?
[387:38.69]Okay, I thought I was gonna have to take, like, a baby...
[387:44.95]Alright.
[387:45.51]Is that... You know, I'm... I got to tell you I have a little bit of an issue with this part of the game.
[388:11.01]This is just the same, this is like the same exact thing that happened in Resident Evil 7.
[388:16.77]It's like, oh, like the puzzle weird like escape room guy.
[388:19.35]They're kind of just doing that again.
[388:31.05]Wait, I'm going to save it.
[388:37.86]In a while.
[388:41.30]Why is everybody doing... I understand the BabyRage from the first 20 minutes of the stream when I was screaming, fuck Capcom, into the camera.
[388:50.93]And yeah, I know, I'm noticing a trend here.
[388:53.25]I'm gonna run out of companies to, like, hate in the next, like, you know, every week it's another one.
[388:58.57]It was Nickelodeon, Capcom, Nintendo.
[389:02.11]I just... I'm gonna run out of things to dislike.
[389:09.16]And maybe it's me.
[389:10.12]You know, if I hate everything, is it just me?
[389:14.14]I'm the problem.
[389:21.64]He looked over there and then he looked this way.
[389:23.08]I guess I'm just going in.
[389:43.82]It's still an emote only.
[389:45.08]I'm assuming that something really, really ridiculous is going to happen here soon.
[389:51.10]Breaker box key.
[389:52.10]Is that it?
[389:53.53]I believe that's it.
[390:01.57]Don't lock me in here.
[390:18.37]Where's my baby?
[390:19.93]Where's my baby?
[390:26.39]Fuck Capcom!
[390:28.90]Fuck Nintendo!

[391:51.92]I don't know what it is.
[391:52.62]I don't know what it is.
[391:54.18]Oh my god, I don't know what it is.
[391:55.76]I don't know what's going on.

[393:29.40]That was really, really scary.
[393:32.20]I did not like that at all.
[393:35.06]Did Capcom just play P.T.
[393:37.82]and then go, yeah, well, that's never getting fucking made, so let's go ahead and make something like that.
[393:47.93]That was terrifying.

[393:50.35]Mama, dada.
[393:52.37]That was... Whoa, I can't even tell you.

[411:45.11]Okay.
[411:50.81]Touch a button on it or something?
[411:53.67]I'm good.

[411:57.62]I'm good.
[411:57.92]I'm alright.
[411:58.30]I'm not done.

[412:17.68]Alright.
[412:18.80]I got two pieces of rose.
[412:22.96]Now I can get the treasure.
[412:24.16]This is going to take me back up, right?
[412:41.66]Yeah.
[412:47.09]I've been live for like 10 hours?
[412:48.41]No, I haven't.
[412:48.79]It's been like six and a half, seven.
[413:02.40]I need a bathroom break.
[413:03.98]Alright.
[413:05.16]I want to get some water because I apparently blew my voice up.
[413:08.58]Hopefully it doesn't stay like this.
[413:11.06]I'm supposed to be streaming tomorrow.
[413:14.34]I'm getting old, man.
[413:16.32]Like, really?
[413:17.04]I can't even, like, yell about video games anymore?
[413:29.54]I want the treasure.
[413:38.24]Oh, no.
[413:38.48]Put the doll here.
[413:46.46]Where is she?
[413:49.24]Where's Angie?
[413:59.97]What?
[414:00.53]Wait, did I not?
[414:05.55]Can't use that here.
[414:09.65]Examine the doll?
[414:12.16]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[414:25.83]Is it like a button?
[414:26.63]Take like the head off?
[414:27.79]Pull like a leg off?
[414:28.57]I don't understand.
[414:31.34]What do I do?
[414:35.74]Stop!
[414:36.22]Press E?
[414:48.97]I don't think that does anything.
[414:51.59]Shit!
[414:52.05]So what am I supposed to put here?
[414:56.20]Oh, that would make so much sense if I just put the doll there.
[415:02.35]Well, what the... I don't know.
[415:03.39]Oh, whatever.
[415:08.39]Alright, we're going back.
[415:12.61]And... Damn it, I really wanted that.
[415:23.48]I didn't fire a single weapon almost that whole time.
[415:37.09]Now we are firing weapons, aren't we?
[415:48.70]We can die.
[415:56.90]How many people are... My goodness.
[416:11.39]Alright, I gotta sell and upgrade.
[416:12.87]Because I have a lot of money.
[416:13.93]How am I going to reload?
[416:17.93]Reload what?
[416:22.62]Okay.
[416:25.02]So... Hey.
[416:29.60]Hey.
[416:29.96]Hey.
[416:32.26]What's this?
[416:33.90]Oh, shit.
[416:34.24]It's a new gun.
[416:36.79]I don't want to use it yet.
[416:42.98]Nice mine.
[416:44.86]Block pick.
[416:55.59]Whatever.
[416:58.52]Free kill.
[416:58.96]I'll take it.
[417:12.17]I dropped a gun?
[417:13.13]No, I didn't.
[417:15.09]I just picked up a new one.
[417:17.33]Alright, powerful widespread pump action combat shotgun.
[417:24.26]Very cool.
[417:27.58]Alright, nothing else here.
[417:28.54]I can go... Wait, hold on.
[417:39.67]Nothing.
[417:41.15]Nothing.
[417:42.80]Whatever.
[417:43.10]Alright.
[417:50.88]Oh, yeah.
[417:51.22]2,000 bucks.
[417:51.62]I'll take it.
[417:52.08]I need to get a ray gun.
[417:57.36]I need to get water.
[417:58.84]Let me get back to the hub.
[418:00.19]Because this is going... This wraps around.
[418:06.67]Hold on.
[418:07.59]Let me see where this goes.
[418:17.30]If I go... Yeah.
[418:22.63]Yes.
[418:23.45]There we go.
[418:23.81]Oh, I thought that was a birdcage.
[418:25.11]Damn it.
[418:25.35]Hyper-focused Andy.
[418:30.17]Oh, fuck.
[418:33.92]I'm trying to just leave to go get a drink.
[418:37.64]I'll be fine.
[418:38.26]Once I drink some water, I'll be back to normal.
[418:39.96]Just you watch.
[418:43.40]Finish it tomorrow?
[418:45.89]Um, I probably will, but I'm good.
[418:48.41]I'm still having fun.
[418:49.05]I'm still going.
[418:50.41]Having a good time.
[418:52.61]You're a sponge.
[418:53.57]I know.
[418:58.16]I still like it.
[418:59.12]I'm still having a good time, so I'm going to keep playing.
[419:05.78]Ooh, nice.
[419:12.41]I'll be honest with you.
[419:13.15]I'd rather do like eight, nine hours tonight...
[419:19.59]Where does that go?
[419:23.75]Then... Have like seven or eight hours tomorrow.
[419:27.79]If that makes any sense.
[419:35.47]Go over a strange bird.
[419:36.67]A blue bird.
[419:39.83]Is that... Do I put that down?
[419:43.66]Do I put the head down?
[419:55.48]Shit.
[419:55.72]I think spherical.
[420:01.21]Oh, there's like so many of these little spherical things and I can't do any of them.
[420:12.77]Luthier is key.
[420:13.89]Don't sleep yet if you want to keep going.
[420:20.12]Yeah, I'm good.
[420:23.20]Mistress Donna is now Mother Miranda's adopted daughter.
[420:25.71]In all my years, I've never been this overjoyed.
[420:27.49]There's a lot to read.
[420:30.23]Somebody will read it someday.
[420:33.35]Something else still in here?
[420:40.08]It's that.
[420:43.00]Okay.
[420:43.40]What else?
[420:46.40]I fully explored this zone.
[420:48.59]Let's go.
[420:55.51]Give places to be?
[420:56.37]Okay, another hour.
[421:00.69]Another one hour.
[421:01.43]And I'm good.
[421:18.27]Just beat the game.
[421:20.49]Oh, I don't... I think it's gonna... It's like, I think there's at least another four or five hours left in the game.
[421:26.33]If I would assume.
[421:36.25]Where are you?
[421:43.26]What?
[421:43.40]It's like probably three or four.
[421:48.64]Give me that.
[421:49.08]Whatever.
[421:53.59]Somebody's... I think somebody's behind me.
[421:55.63]Holy shit, where did you come from?
[421:57.13]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[422:00.33]I've had enough.
[422:00.95]I've had enough of you.
[422:09.72]Hi.
[422:15.56]Okay.
[422:15.84]You missed a... Bofa?
[422:23.76]Oh, I didn't.
[422:30.20]Didn't even get a chance.
[422:32.80]What?
[422:44.50]Alright, finally.
[422:52.03]I have returned.
[422:56.92]Alright, let's sell.
[422:57.90]Wait, can I combine anything?
[423:06.25]I need health.
[423:07.67]Let's do the smart thing.
[423:08.44]Let's make some shotgun ammo.
[423:12.82]My handgun ammo.
[423:14.36]Another health.
[423:15.14]Alright, I'm good to go now.
[423:18.55]Does this look familiar to you?
[423:26.44]28,000.
[423:26.58]Holy shit.
[423:33.24]Combinable.
[423:34.60]Combinable.
[423:35.32]Don't do that.
[423:36.00]Alright.
[423:36.34]Sell that stuff.
[423:36.82]Alright.
[423:37.78]So this is definitely just going to be better than the shotgun.
[423:41.72]So let's upgrade it. 840.
[423:54.36]Okay.
[423:54.74]Ammo capacity.
[423:55.69]Let's get that up.
[423:56.33]I'm going to sell the other shotgun.
[424:01.97]Because that's okay.
[424:03.35]720.
[424:05.39]Go to 800.
[424:05.63]It's got 9 capacity.
[424:08.63]This has 6 capacity.
[424:10.33]I'm just going to sell it.
[424:17.20]Can I take that off?
[424:19.36]Or is that just for this weapon?
[424:22.25]Please do take a look at my new stock.
[424:28.23]39th, yeah, sell it.
[424:33.78]Do take care selecting your weapons.
[424:45.00]I got plenty of money.
[424:45.66]Let's upgrade this too.
[424:48.04]Uh, ammo capacity.
[424:49.35]One moment, please.
[424:51.67]Rate of fire.
[424:52.21]The rate of fire on this is terrible.
[424:53.56]Let's do power, though.
[424:54.28]High magnification scope.
[425:05.74]Yeah.
[425:06.97]Alright, you got anything else here?
[425:12.45]Explosive rounds.
[425:13.57]Flashbangs.
[425:15.71]Pipe bombs.
[425:19.78]Call me moron, doesn't matter.
[425:23.46]Yeah, I don't care.
[425:30.19]I just want more.
[425:32.39]Let's put that thing up here.
[425:42.85]So this thing is a combat shotgun.
[425:45.57]Very cool.
[425:46.09]Alright, looking good.
[425:48.68]Alright, I'm gonna get some water.
[425:49.50]I'll be right back.
[425:49.94]This is the last break of the night.
[425:54.48]We're gonna see if I can get to, like, through one more area.
[425:59.03]So then tomorrow, I can come back and finish it in a few hours.
[426:08.55]So we're going down here.
[426:17.24]I'll be right back.
[426:18.52]Final break.
[429:37.50]Okay.
[429:39.08]Oh, I feel so much better.
[429:39.84]I just... Somebody said I was a sponge.
[429:45.80]Yeah, pretty much.
[429:49.50]Oh, I feel like a thousand times better.
[429:58.89]Do you... Do you know how hot it is in here?
[430:03.57]So it's been like seven hours, right?
[430:05.75]How much is in here?
[430:08.10]This is a quart of water.
[430:09.36]This would be the third quart of water I've drank today.
[430:13.46]It's kind of crazy if you think about it.
[430:17.67]Okay.
[430:21.67]So, to go down, let's go... We have to go this way, right?
[430:27.33]We need to get to this guy.
[430:29.29]This, like, Igor guy.
[430:30.29]We're gonna go down.
[430:31.89]We need to save it.
[430:42.52]I'd be drinking a gallon a day.
[430:43.94]I don't know about that.
[430:47.92]I don't know about that.
[430:57.64]How'd you find the doll section?
[430:58.82]Horrifying.
[431:00.66]Frustrating.
[431:01.24]Terrifying.
[431:02.84]Very, very, very scary.
[431:08.62]Frustrating is not even the right word.
[431:09.53]It was like... The doll part...
[431:28.63]What the fuck?
[431:38.63]Run.
[431:39.83]The wounds are severe.
[431:40.59]I won't last much longer.
[431:41.65]I can hear it shuffling about outside.
[431:43.37]It barely flinched when I shot it.
[431:45.75]I feel like it's toying with me.
[431:46.93]That isn't a wolf.
[431:49.09]Still, I won't lie down like a dog.
[431:50.43]If I can get to the old water mill, I can stop it.
[431:55.09]I can protect you.
[431:55.65]It's so close.
[431:56.25]Damn, I'm so close.
[431:57.55]My legs don't work.
[431:59.69]Get to the old water mill.
[432:03.03]Okay, sure thing.
[432:03.84]Get to the water mill.
[432:13.54]Oh my god, I'm gonna have... This sucks.
[432:27.93]Can you jump up here?
[432:28.55]I don't think you can jump up here, right?
[432:31.41]Alright, what's the plan?
[432:35.31]The plan is to go through that door.
[432:36.65]Wait, treasure.
[433:00.93]I don't... Stop making noise, chicken!
[433:13.78]Scrap.
[433:16.88]Did he break that?
[433:17.40]I don't know, maybe.
[433:23.33]Shh.
[433:23.75]Shut up.
[433:36.43]Quiet.
[433:42.71]So when did this game become like the scary monster just finds you game?
[434:02.13]Okay, then I'm going from here into this building.
[434:04.61]I need a route.
[434:07.05]I need a route.
[434:07.65]I need a plan.
[434:08.24]There's a person in this one.
[434:37.69]Alright, we're good.
[434:45.34]That person just proned in Call of Duty twice accidentally.
[434:54.43]Okay, can I break this?
[434:57.89]This looks like it's here for a reason, doesn't it?
[434:59.91]I don't know what it's here for, but...
[435:06.28]Whatever.
[435:07.22]Is he not?
[435:07.88]Okay.
[435:13.96]Can't go through this?
[435:24.88]Like, there's weird, like, poison over there.
[435:26.12]So I have to go straight across here?
[435:50.76]What's in here?
[435:51.28]Anything?
[435:51.54]Is this a safe house?
[435:59.75]There's a treasure in there.
[436:05.31]Damn it.
[436:09.62]Can I get there from here?
[436:27.85]I think I hear him behind me running.
[436:30.43]Do I hear him running behind me?
[436:32.09]No, that's the water.
[436:36.83]That's the water.
[436:37.33]That's the water wheel.
[436:38.86]Oh, man.
[436:39.54]Oh, man.
[436:39.98]I don't know what that is, but that's a rocket launcher.
[436:44.56]It's a grenade launcher.
[436:49.46]Holy shit.
[436:50.14]Alright.
[436:50.39]Inventory management.
[436:51.27]I have so many heals.
[436:58.49]Alright, bring this down here.
[437:01.85]Explosive rounds.
[437:03.22]Pipe bombs.
[437:05.94]I don't have a magnum.
[437:10.24]Fine, get that over here.
[437:16.68]I don't like this.
[437:17.34]This has got to go up top.
[437:18.38]You've got to do it in order of appearance.
[437:36.52]Okay.
[437:37.74]Shotgun.
[437:43.53]Looks better.
[437:43.99]Alright, let's put that here.
[437:45.83]Okay, so now I have a... Oh, shit.
[437:52.21]Should I just blow him up?
[437:54.36]Can I just kill this thing?
[437:55.68]Like, just by killing it?
[437:56.42]Like, attacking it?
[437:58.56]Or should I just not be an idiot?
[438:00.48]And do it.
[438:01.46]Do the way that I think I'm supposed to do.
[438:08.25]This is clean.
[438:10.74]You can kill it.
[438:11.68]You can kill it.
[438:16.62]It's not that crazy.
[438:17.60]Alright, let's just fuck him up.
[438:20.68]You suck at gaming.
[438:21.88]That's not the question I asked.

[439:20.42]I'm gonna shove this into his mouth.
[439:24.24]What's the trajectory like?
[439:25.20]I don't know.
[439:25.50]Where the hell is he?
[439:41.56]How many more?
[439:41.96]How many more?
[439:42.36]Another one?
[439:42.70]You want another one?
[439:43.44]How's that?
[439:43.76]That was just like Wario, but like Waluigi.
[439:55.67]Will that hurt me?
[440:03.33]Got him!
[440:08.74]Crystal Beast.
[440:12.10]Oh, nice.
[440:12.56]Alright, he's dead.
[440:13.34]That wasn't that bad.

[440:18.82]Nice.

[440:30.84]Wait.
[440:37.13]Eh, fuck it.
[440:45.58]Go to the other treasure.
[441:01.45]Nah, let's go.
[441:04.77]Nah.
[441:07.55]We're in a slimy substance.
[441:08.51]Looks breakable.
[441:17.75]Okay.
[441:19.21]Nothing else, right?
[441:20.01]Yeah, we're good.
[441:24.89]Remember the Igor man has a PS4.
[441:28.05]I don't blame him for having a PS4.
[441:29.91]It's not worth getting a PS5 yet.
[441:31.35]Probably won't be for like another year.
[441:41.96]Block from the other side.
[441:42.74]Alright, I gotta kill these pigs.
[441:52.32]Well, I mean, it's because they're still releasing games for PS4.
[441:55.92]Most things that come up for PS5 just come up for PS4 anyways, don't they still?
[442:00.30]There's like three or four games you can only get on PS4, right?
[442:02.72]PS5, right?
[442:07.57]Yeah, so I mean, maybe like in a year they'll have a bunch of stuff.
[442:10.13]Yeah, that's good.
[442:10.83]I didn't say the PS5 sucks.
[442:14.67]Don't hurt me.
[442:15.41]Alright, I gotta, I have, alright, we gotta do it.
[442:19.37]I just, I want, it's permanent health upgrades.
[442:26.17]I hate doing this, but it's for huge upgrades.
[442:43.29]Photo of a rare animal.
[442:51.70]That's the white pig that I didn't kill.
[442:58.42]I shotgunned him in the head.
[443:00.14]Once.
[443:01.36]And let him live.
[443:12.15]I don't think I... I don't... I don't know.
[443:13.71]I don't think I killed it.
[443:18.93]God damn it.
[443:19.88]I don't think I did.
[443:28.60]I did kill him?
[443:29.26]Are you sure?
[443:29.87]I don't think I did.
[443:31.55]This stuff too, I don't get what this stuff is for.
[443:44.17]You definitely killed one pig.
[443:45.30]Yeah, but it wasn't like the rare pig.
[443:48.29]Alright, well I have to go get this thing from the... There's definitely like a... There's a thing I gotta get down here.
[443:52.91]It's like a laboratory down here.
[443:54.43]Alright, I gotta get like the thing to open the door to go to the laboratory and then shoot Igor in the head.
[444:01.39]You got it.
[444:01.79]Let's go.
[444:13.58]I shot him with a pistol, did I?
[444:23.72]Alright, question.
[444:25.14]How far in the game am I right now?
[444:29.14]Percentage wise.
[444:38.83]More than, a little bit more than halfway.
[444:39.93]45?
[444:39.95]50%?
[444:39.97]55?
[444:40.69]Okay.
[444:40.83]So after I do this portion, I'll be about 60% of the way?
[444:54.65]Alright, let's see it.
[444:56.43]Alright, cool.
[445:00.07]We'll see how I feel, I don't know.
[445:03.63]Alright.
[445:04.55]The Labyrinth Puzzle.
[445:05.83]Of course it has to be a fucking puzzle, doesn't it?
[445:08.63]Okay.
[445:27.22]Reload.

[445:39.73]Can't get rid of these boogers?
[445:42.27]Why not?
[445:45.23]Oh, I can just walk by them.
[445:51.89]You can't take it, master.
[445:53.93]It's mine.
[445:55.49]Pretty good Igor, I'll tell you.
[446:07.31]I'll just be taking this She's not hers Oh
[446:28.34]I love this guy.
[446:52.26]What's so funny?
[446:54.02]You're stupid.
[446:56.30]You talk too much.
[446:57.40]It's all over.
[447:00.53]I plugged the way in.
[447:02.65]What are you... This is my territory.
[447:08.49]And I won't let you leave.
[447:12.46]Shit.
[447:12.76]This is my territory.
[447:16.46]And I won't let you leave.
[447:22.72]I gotta tell you, I have an announcement to make.
[447:27.42]You know, I'm an actor.
[447:31.52]This isn't me.
[447:32.42]I didn't do this one.
[447:34.20]I did an iPad game, though, like 12 years ago.
[447:36.28]Alright, well, whatever, man.
[447:52.13]Hey.
[447:53.87]Don't go.
[448:05.37]I can't let you leave.

[449:05.18]Ooh.
[449:07.68]Engine nut?
[449:08.76]No, I don't want to do that yet.
[449:09.89]I want to open this.
[449:12.11]That guy sucked.
[449:16.83]I don't think that's the last that we're going to see of him.
[449:19.11]Okay.
[449:23.30]I'm pretty sure that guy is the main antagonist for the remainder.
[449:27.68]I need the boat key.
[449:40.31]Oh, it's a giant swamp.
[449:52.96]Where's the boat key?
[449:53.96]Do I have to go back in here?

[450:01.21]You need to get the boat.
[450:03.85]Oh, no, you can't leave.
[450:05.13]You need to get the boat key.
[450:08.47]There's a canoe that's outside.

[450:43.65]I tried to break yellow wood before and it didn't work.
[450:48.59]I don't know.
[450:48.97]Remember I tried to slash it and it didn't work.

[456:30.39]Nevermind.
[456:33.81]Somebody said Minecraft boat physics.
[456:38.12]That's pretty good.
[456:39.04]That's funny.
[456:41.68]It really is Minecraft.
[456:51.13]Oh, God.
[456:52.05]Not another giant monster to attack you.
[456:54.93]Wait.
[457:01.98]I can go through that!
[457:03.34]Oh my god, don't even tell me.
[457:04.74]I can go through that!
[457:05.72]I'm gonna puke if I keep doing that.
[457:11.34]I'm actually gonna throw up if I do that anymore.
[457:12.74]I'm actually gonna throw up now.
[457:16.48]Alright, disembark.
[457:33.06]Everything reloaded?
[457:34.32]Seems like it.
[457:34.88]Very good.
[457:38.39]Let's go.
[457:43.19]What the hell?
[457:45.69]Research post or something?
[457:48.51]What the fuck are they doing here?
[457:52.81]Chris.
[457:53.79]It's Chris Redfield.
[457:56.59]No.
[457:57.41]It's Hunk.
[457:58.31]Ethan.
[458:02.40]I gotta say, I'm surprised you made it this far.
[458:06.12]It'd be a shame if something happened to you now.
[458:09.01]Sir Chris, why not?
[458:10.97]You killed Mia.
[458:12.25]Now do me and finish the job.
[458:17.59]Hey Cap, I'm getting some serious motion readings out here.
[458:20.82]We should move on.
[458:24.37]What kind of readings?
[458:25.77]What's moving?
[458:26.59]Unknown, but my guess is we've been here too long and Miranda knows it.
[458:30.27]Hey, hey, did you say Miranda?
[458:32.41]How are you involved?
[458:33.17]Leave it alone, Ethan.
[458:34.35]You are out of your depth.
[458:35.95]What about the sample analysis?
[458:36.74]I don't know why you're putting on an Australian accent.
[458:44.82]Now I hate when you do the fucking Australian accent.
[458:47.78]You stay out of our business, Ethan.
[458:49.08]What business?
[458:49.70]Watch out!
[458:56.83]Why did he save me?
[459:04.42]Oh my god.
[459:06.02]Is Chris not a bad guy?
[459:08.48]Why did he save me?
[459:09.38]Is that him?
[459:16.99]Wait, that's him.
[459:22.93]I don't have time for this.
[459:27.18]His voice got deeper.
[459:53.90]What are you talking about?
[459:59.34]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[460:23.76]I just had like a long night of partying.
[460:27.83]That was like the couch.
[460:29.47]Oh my god.
[460:42.85]I am running.
[460:54.51]what am I supposed to do yeah I don't know down here it knows you killed the fish why did you kill those fishes there was no reason for you to do that those were my friends
[461:23.06]He said the exits underwater.
[461:24.36]He's just a giant fish guy.
[461:33.08]Alright, well, he's just a big fish.
[461:40.85]Oh no, OK.
[461:43.31]Red, red all the way down.
[461:59.13]Oh, it's this guy.
[461:59.89]Okay.
[462:13.39]How do I get in that room?
[462:20.66]Oh, that's... Okay.
[462:22.80]Hi!
[462:24.70]If it's just looking, window shop away.
[462:28.49]Crystal Fragment.
[462:29.61]Perfect Skull.
[462:31.80]Crystal Beast.
[462:32.40]That is... Yeah, so that was worth it killing him.
[462:37.14]Alright.
[462:38.94]I did get some new shit, though.
[462:40.40]Let's see.
[462:41.95]Oh, I can't upgrade the Grenade Launcher?
[462:43.37]That's annoying.
[462:47.59]Are you selling these for... Okay, hold on.
[462:58.05]Great leaders recoil.
[463:01.01]His recoil.
[463:13.18]I mean, I don't know.
[463:16.72]Oh, it's because they have all their upgrades.
[463:17.88]That makes sense.
[463:24.14]I feel like I should get the shotgun thing.
[463:28.05]What do you think?
[463:29.23]Should I just save money?
[463:30.89]I don't really even need it, though.
[463:31.89]I don't.
[463:32.23]I really don't need it.
[463:36.32]Maybe, uh, crafting explosive rounds?
[463:38.68]Yeah, that's good.
[463:42.54]Have the grenade launcher.
[463:47.43]I'll save my money.
[463:48.15]Okay.
[463:55.46]Metal scrap, herb, and gunpowders to make an explosive round.
[464:00.42]Yeah, I'll do it.
[464:11.63]Does the duke sell catboy suits?
[464:15.09]No.
[464:18.23]Save.
[464:19.13]Save.
[464:20.23]Save.
[464:21.10]Yes, I will.
[464:24.25]Yes, I will.
[464:24.83]Okay, good.
[464:28.57]Uh, I think I'm ready to keep moving.
[464:32.29]There's a weird puzzle here I have to do.
[464:35.84]If I can drain the water.
[464:40.32]Shit, there's no power.
[464:41.64]Of course not.
[464:42.14]Throwing the electricity to the sluice gate.
[464:47.08]Alright, let's go.
[464:53.46]Cook the meat.
[464:56.62]Very, very, very good idea.
[464:58.06]Thank you.
[465:00.90]This one is... Oh, I can't do it.
[465:11.43]Ah, shit.
[465:11.87]I need fish.
[465:12.91]Health increases permanently.
[465:14.09]I need juicy game.
[465:16.99]Okay, I need...
[465:31.28]I need fish.
[465:34.76]I need... Okay, I need two more chickens.
[465:40.50]Or... I need four fish.
[465:43.10]I'm going for four fish.
[465:46.40]I'm sure I'm going to get them in this level.
[465:47.50]Kiss him.
[465:48.18]What are you talking about?
[465:49.02]Alright.
[466:00.62]Turn on the electricity.
[466:05.33]Which... I'm kind of just going the other way.
[466:07.65]I have to go this way, right?
[466:08.75]Can I... Wait.
[466:10.03]I'm losing my place here.
[466:11.71]I gotta go this way.
[466:17.93]Alright.
[466:18.59]Up.
[466:18.71]Let's go around.
[466:20.39]Into the outhouse.
[466:21.18]Cool.
[466:25.70]Chem fluid.
[466:26.48]Good.
[466:28.40]Very good.
[466:40.06]This crank is old and busted up.
[466:41.40]It feels like it's going to snap any second.
[466:43.27]I hope it doesn't break.
[466:44.09]The only other one we have is at the windmill.
[466:46.61]Over at windmill two.
[466:53.79]This is windmill one.
[466:54.83]Where's windmill two?
[467:01.43]Over there.
[467:01.73]It's gonna break.
[467:17.70]Seriously?
[467:20.44]Why would it have not broken?
[467:21.90]Of course it's going to break.
[467:32.61]There are chickens.
[467:33.23]Go back.
[467:40.68]And...
[467:42.40]I think I'm going to officially call it.
[467:43.76]I'm starting to get really tired.
[467:47.81]I'm starting to get tired.
[467:49.95]I will be back here tomorrow.
[467:58.45]Let me actually do this first.
[467:59.77]Let's go get the chickens.
[468:03.63]Yeah, I'm getting tired.
[468:04.25]I can feel it waving over me.
[468:08.59]We'll just pick up tomorrow.
[468:11.19]So, theoretically, I should, tomorrow, as long as I don't stall Andy, I should be able to, um... Did he survive the gunshot?
[468:29.50]Oh my god!
[468:31.36]Killed his chicken!
[468:32.08]I think I have enough.
[468:43.46]Another fan's not gonna work tomorrow?
[468:44.91]Do not jinx me like that, please.
[468:50.59]I should be at, like, the halfway mark.
[468:52.27]You think I'll be able to do it tomorrow?
[468:55.11]If I do, like, another solid, like, five to six hours tomorrow, you think I'll finish the game?
[468:58.70]I should, right?
[469:00.18]I get this guy, the hammer guy, and then whatever the last part of the game is.
[469:04.16]Yeah, that's fine.
[469:05.38]It's easy.
[469:07.06]As long as I don't delay Andy.
[469:09.98]Yeah, I won't.
[469:14.84]Oh, yes.
[469:15.50]I thought he was eating that book.
[469:18.54]Okay.
[469:19.60]Good.
[469:20.28]Let's make it.
[469:22.93]Damage taken when guarding decreases permanently.
[469:25.57]Or, wait.
[469:30.93]I'll still have enough to do this.
[469:32.19]But I'll need more meat to do this one.
[469:34.57]I don't think I've guarded once.
[469:36.75]So, I'm not going to use it.
[469:39.55]I'll use it later.
[469:40.31]Alright.
[469:42.51]Save the game.
[469:47.25]What time tomorrow?
[469:48.55]We're gonna start around 2 p.m.
[469:50.89]tomorrow.
[469:51.97]2 p.m.
[469:52.29]Pacific.
[469:55.55]I like starting with the car games later.
[469:57.57]Because then, like, it goes into the nighttime.
[469:59.21]2 p.m.
[470:00.95]Oh, RTX.
[470:01.53]Right, we'll do RTX.
[470:04.94]Let's see what it looks like.
[470:07.86]RTX on.
[470:17.15]Look, I turned this down because I was scared.
[470:18.95]Ray tracing.
[470:19.57]Let's go.
[470:19.85]Did it work?
[470:26.77]Ray tracing on.
[470:28.91]Hi.
[470:29.61]Hi.
[470:29.81]Here we go.
[470:34.21]Ray tracing on.
[470:48.19]Did I not apply it?
[471:20.68]I need a light source.
[471:25.22]Is this doing anything?
[471:25.92]It looks like kind of cool.
[471:39.79]Restart it?
[471:42.95]Yeah, it's because there's no like shiny floors.
[471:45.42]I need a shiny floor to look at.
[471:48.54]Yeah, there's no shiny floor to look at.
[471:51.30]Eh.
[471:52.47]It's streaming at 720.
[471:53.33]We're not going to see anything.
[471:54.49]Actually, let me see if I can get that for tomorrow, too.
[471:57.65]Shoot the gun?
[472:03.63]Whoa!
[472:04.01]Look at that!
[472:06.57]Was it doing that before?
[472:07.35]I don't know.
[472:16.42]It may have actually been doing that before.
[472:28.44]I don't think anything changed.
[472:31.49]Just don't save it.
[472:33.77]Alright.
[472:35.05]We'll try to finish it tomorrow.
[472:36.15]I'll see you tomorrow at 2 o'clock.
[472:40.05]Yes.
[472:45.71]Ray tracing looked good.
[472:49.20]Yeah, I think you'd want to do that in the mansion.
[472:55.14]Actually, hold on.
[473:01.46]This is the castle, right?
[473:06.13]I'm curious.
[473:06.95]I want to see.
[473:07.25]I want to see what it looks like.
[473:09.69]Okay, ray tracing is on.
[473:19.54]Okay, that actually looks pretty fucking cool.
[473:28.34]It actually does look really good.
[473:35.97]That looks really nice.
[473:43.47]The autosave might mess up.
[473:44.84]Oh, shit.
[473:45.36]Will it?
[473:49.30]No, it's not going to fuck it up, right?
[473:53.48]No, we're good.
[473:53.90]Okay.
[473:54.84]Alright.
[473:56.94]Let me see if I can do... I'm going to try to go to 900p.
[473:59.28]If I can.
[474:03.94]So tomorrow, if all goes to plan, this will be a 900p stream.
[474:11.97]I gotta be careful, though.
[474:13.97]I gotta replace one of the fans.
[474:19.23]Even this looks good, too.
[474:21.99]Alright, well, thanks for watching.
[474:22.91]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[474:24.29]I'll try to finish Resident Evil Village.
[474:26.85]I ran out of gas.
[474:28.66]Go eat something.
[474:31.65]Uh, I... Sorry, I said, uh, fuck Capcom, I don't mean that.
[474:35.93]I did, very much so, at the very beginning of the stream, because I can't believe that a company in 2021 would put a game on a PC and have hardlocked the fucking FOV.
[474:44.90]I don't, I find that to be impossible.
[474:47.14]It's like, I almost think it has to have been done on purpose.
[474:59.00]Still, the, wait, the baby was the NASCAR fuel?
[475:02.35]That I just burnt through?
[475:04.25]I pretty much did.
[475:09.03]I blew out my voice during that segment.
[475:12.23]I can't wait to see the embarrassing clips and gifs that I'm gonna feed through in the bath later.
[475:18.06]And I cringe in the bathtub.
[475:23.71]I'll see you guys tomorrow, thanks for watching.
[475:28.67]Thanks for all the subs.
[475:29.29]There were a lot of gifted subs today.
[475:30.61]I missed a bunch of them.
[475:31.27]I was very, very much in the zone here.
[475:36.59]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[475:44.42]I'm now going to eat something to eat and shut up and stop talking till tomorrow.
[475:50.44]Otherwise, it's going to be really interesting waking up with a broken voice.
[475:57.61]Like I was at a soccer game or something.
[476:00.01]I was just screaming.
[476:02.12]No, no, no.
[476:02.52]I feel like I was at my son's baseball game.
[476:06.72]And I was really, really proud of him.
[476:20.65]It's already break.
[476:21.33]Yeah, I'm going to stop talking.
[476:25.01]Drink tea.
[476:25.73]Yeah, I'll have some tea.
[476:26.90]That sounds good.
[476:29.52]I'll give you... My rating of the game so far is still an 8.6.
[476:34.34]It stays there.
[476:36.46]We'll see how it ends.
[476:37.78]It might drop a few points tomorrow.
[476:39.18]It might go up a few points.
[476:40.10]I don't know.
[476:40.48]I think it's really good.
[476:45.78]Why is it not a 9?
[476:46.40]Because it's locked at 80 FOV and I find that to be fucking embarrassing.
[476:50.16]And I'm not afraid to say it.
[477:05.77]If the FOV mod is easy to get, I might just put it on tomorrow.
[477:19.61]Do a raid?
[477:20.07]Well, let's raid tomorrow.
[477:22.69]I feel like it's really late right now.
[477:26.80]We'll do a raid tomorrow.
[477:28.00]I'll dump you guys somewhere tomorrow.
[477:33.00]It's like 3 a.m.
[477:37.80]I think it's like 2 or 3 a.m.
[477:38.72]Eastern right now.
[477:46.39]Ooh.
[477:47.11]It's very late.
[477:50.49]Alright.
[477:50.75]I'll see you tomorrow.
[477:53.55]Have a great night.
[477:54.93]Goodbye.
[477:55.45]Oh, my God.
[477:57.65]Alright.
[477:58.01]I'm not talking anymore.
[478:02.34]Thanks for sticking around.
[478:03.06]I know a lot of you stayed up late, so see you tomorrow.
[478:07.89]Have a good night.
[478:53.42]Thank you.
