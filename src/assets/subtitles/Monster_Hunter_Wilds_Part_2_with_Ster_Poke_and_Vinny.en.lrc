[00:05.07]Alright.
[00:06.59]So what happened?
[00:07.77]You sound good.
[00:08.71]You sound perfect.
[00:11.08]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:12.38]Everything was my fault today.
[00:15.86]Uh, that is not true.
[00:20.34]I'm not going to hear that.
[00:25.81]They're saying I'm mudded.
[00:28.89]Mudded?
[00:29.23]Wait, what?
[00:32.89]Why won't my Monster Hunter open?
[00:36.06]Oh, yeah.
[00:36.99]It took me about, I don't know, 40 seconds yesterday.
[00:40.75]Do they even care?
[00:49.29]No.
[00:49.82]Fix the game.
[00:50.70]Alright.

[01:03.63]You had that ready to go.
[01:04.81]That was loaded.
[01:06.51]in the barrel.
[01:09.68]Was Babe Ruth in The Simpsons chat?
[01:12.00]Probably.
[01:12.38]Everybody's in The Simpsons, right?
[01:15.98]So who is your favorite Simpsons character that isn't the main family?
[01:23.21]I kind of like...

[02:18.76]Nah, I love Homer.
[02:21.47]Yeah, he excluded Homer.
[02:23.51]He was not allowing family choices.
[02:25.97]Oh, wait, he did?
[02:26.89]I was fixing my flank.
[02:29.98]Alright, so what do you guys have?
[02:32.00]One of you rank 500 gamers?
[02:37.96]No main family.
[02:38.96]I'm opening it.
[02:40.44]The thing is loading.
[02:42.93]It's like crash loading right now.
[02:48.27]um I hold on create a private lobby millhouse's dad says a chat member I do it yeah kirk is amazing I'm a I'm a skinner fan as I like I like millhouse those are some good ones should we join our own games first or do we wait till you have the lobby code right yeah Vinny thought that homer had a beak yeah what's the religious dad
[03:17.57]You know about that?
[03:18.81]The Religious Dead is Flanders.
[03:20.32]I don't know why I know about that.
[03:22.50]Flanders is hilarious.
[03:24.72]I like Flanders too.
[03:25.78]Here, take a look at this image.
[03:28.18]So I was showing this weird art.
[03:31.58]No, it's real.
[03:33.72]So I was showing art of human-animal hybrids that was in some weird book in Japan.
[03:40.27]And then I remembered that when I was a kid, I thought Homer's Five O'Clock Shadow was a beak.
[03:47.76]So wait, yeah, I always thought it was weird, but I never did studies like you here I'm kind of I'm like kind of like sick in the head, but that's cool.
[04:01.17]No me too.
[04:01.77]No me too.
[04:03.07]Yeah, I'm mentally ill I have my sickness.
[04:07.71]I also have my sickness completely normal
[04:12.71]I've been watching a lot of Simpsons, though, too.
[04:14.85]Like, if you go on Twitch and you scroll down a little bit, there's Family Guy, Simpsons.
[04:19.66]Shit just took over.
[04:20.62]Just a little bit?
[04:22.48]A lot of it.
[04:24.24]Man.
[04:24.84]Yeah, I've been doing a lot of Simpsons lately, so I'm like very... This is the first time in my life I'm actually putting effort into the show and watching it.
[04:32.12]I'm really enjoying it.
[04:33.23]I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, and you know what?
[04:35.19]I'm just going to freaking say it.
[04:36.69]I'm so sorry to everybody, and some of you in this call are probably going to look at me different, okay?
[04:42.33]But I just do not enjoy Bob's Burgers.
[04:48.06]I can't enjoy it.
[04:51.32]What is it?
[04:52.52]I did it for like a couple months, and I watched a lot of it, and I had fun with it.
[04:57.78]Maybe I'm in the wrong season.
[05:02.12]I would poke, actually.
[05:03.99]I haven't given it a fair shot, but every time I've seen it, I've kind of just... Teflon slid right off into the ocean.
[05:12.45]I can't invite any of you guys, by the way.
[05:14.31]It shows you... Oh, Vinny is online.
[05:18.36]Let me check something here.
[05:20.56]You're going to invite me?
[05:21.56]Guys, I'm getting a lot of hate right now.
[05:23.96]Can we... Help me.
[05:26.48]Can we turn the heat down on this guy for a sec?
[05:29.25]Link party and also maybe...
[05:32.69]Why don't you make a room?
[05:34.77]Right?
[05:34.93]So we can all see each other.
[05:36.27]Why don't you do your job, Stirr?
[05:38.87]How do you even do it?
[05:41.66]I don't know.
[05:43.70]Neither of you got- Poke and Jerma are not online.
[05:46.88]I'm on now.
[05:49.06]We're talking about Simpsons.
[05:53.60]This game's like- Oh, man.
[05:56.25]This ground texture is so weird.
[05:58.09]Do you want me to do it?
[06:00.97]Do you want me to do it?
[06:04.49]I think I've invited everybody but you into the link party and it says you are not online huh this is last login zero days ago why do I have to like get into a game first maybe yeah okay I'm gonna just go online yeah you need to be like in the game you see me yet what where where were you if you weren't in the game I was opening I mean I was in the menu might have leaked the code but once he gets in
[06:34.74]okay I invited you to link party is there a second step to this like link party is not enough or we needed to make a squad oh my god no it makes it easy at least I put everyone in the link but I don't know how to make a squad the great link quark link my chat saying link party is enough and I tend to believe them half the time
[07:03.60]Hunter request.
[07:05.36]I don't know who that is.
[07:06.16]OK, there you are.
[07:07.72]That's the whole set.
[07:10.80]I should be in, right?
[07:12.84]Like jabroni-ass gear.
[07:14.18]I do like this.
[07:21.54]Am I in the party?
[07:23.08]Yes, everybody is in the party.
[07:26.43]So who was the furthest behind?
[07:28.21]You can just kind of go on your quest and I think it'll give us the alert.
[07:31.53]I'm the furthest behind, I believe.
[07:34.88]Yeah, just keep playing, and we'll join when you're in the thing.
[07:39.20]Okay, I'm going to ride my horse and listen to dialogue for 10 minutes, and then you guys will know.
[07:44.70]Yep.
[07:46.50]Alright.
[07:47.84]I just need to make some new armor because my armor is mega outdated.
[07:51.04]I'm going to drop some graphics.
[07:53.87]My game is lagging.
[08:00.23]Man, it's tough to get rid of Divine Blessing.
[08:04.14]Alert, they don't get the Star Trek references.
[08:08.70]Should we do a Rathian together?
[08:11.09]Yeah, Rathian's the... Rathalos is the one I'm on right now.
[08:15.73]Oh, I'm excited for Rathalos.
[08:16.99]Wait, if you're on one, Dreamer, we just join you.
[08:19.51]Rathalos is right in front of me if anybody wants to pop in.
[08:22.85]Yeah, just start it, I think.
[08:24.50]Okay, I'm fighting Rathalos right now.
[08:27.40]Is that how it works?
[08:29.34]I think so.
[08:32.20]And after you hit it enough times, it starts the quest, and then I think we can join.
[08:35.80]Okay, I'm fighting Rathalos right now.
[08:39.48]Any food?
[08:40.96]I got the thing.
[08:43.12]I have one more before Rathalos.
[08:44.80]I can't do Rathalos.
[08:45.62]Yeah, that's why we're waiting for Vinny.
[08:50.27]Okay.
[08:51.01]You guys have fun, then.
[08:52.27]That's what I'm saying.
[08:53.07]We were waiting for you to start, and I don't know why Jerma... I was just making a piece of armor.
[08:57.81]That's why I'm a little bit behind.
[08:59.35]Poke told me to do it.
[09:01.07]Oh, so stupid.
[09:03.51]Yeah, that's like three layers down of.
[09:07.05]We're waiting.
[09:07.49]Oh, well, he said he wanted to dial easy to dialogue, though, so we can just do this if Jerma is on it and then go back and help.
[09:13.39]I mean, kill it.
[09:14.75]You can do that while I'm doing stuff.
[09:16.41]It's fine.
[09:16.89]You're all good.
[09:18.25]We'll do twice.
[09:19.73]Killing the boss twice is actually getting more mats.
[09:22.48]Hair shopping.
[09:24.54]Chat member, how do I make the thing you were just saying?
[09:34.16]make a divine blessing oh this guy's hard he is really hard I don't know how to join you well you can't join I let me see forge upgrade oh I'm blessing farm
[10:02.75]okay I'm coming I'll be right there I saw a little bit of you playing with the bow the other day Vinny it did look really fun I haven't tried it yet I'm surprised how fun it looks yeah it's not always very fun but I'm using now oh I liked it better than the the light bow gun personally
[10:31.39]I keep busy poke I gotta get um I gotta get some potions go ahead go ahead yeah every game I play I end up a sneaky archer I can't help it skyrim sneaky archer just that one game I got so much in my inventory I laughed that's good
[10:58.25]change equipment blessing charm divine blessing okay I'm coming I'm here what is my divine blessing limit I'll find out I thought that was you doing the voice again shit but it's it's not it's your character doing that I apologize three so I'm already maxed out I'm gonna try to make one more piece of equipment
[11:25.59]I can't control me.
[11:29.18]Where is he?
[11:29.48]Where'd he go?
[11:29.86]Oh, over there.
[11:30.44]Because the ingot has got divine blessing.
[11:37.02]Maybe we can avoid... I like this.
[11:41.30]This is cool.
[11:41.84]Looks awesome.
[11:52.95]Good.
[11:55.62]oh excellent oh I'm about to oh wow I'm about to hit him with that with that fighting game commentary that poke is a little loud oh I do have poke raised hang on I'm sorry alright no no that's my bad it's because I'm you have me lowered so he's like actually like way louder
[12:26.30]you know what star you're at 189 volume on my end Jerma's at 100 and poke was like 150. that's real interesting those are good numbers that's number one look at this move I'm doing oh crap never mind damn oh damn it that's all I had alright we just did we let him go
[12:54.53]Capture and release.
[12:56.77]Oh shit, I will.
[13:02.33]So how do you mount?
[13:03.74]How do you actually mount?
[13:04.90]On a controller?
[13:08.00]Yeah, a controller.
[13:08.74]Do you just have to jump near them or on their back?
[13:12.40]You just attack their back after you jump off the horse, right?
[13:15.90]Yeah, you have to be in the air and then there's a hidden meter of how likely you are to get on their back.
[13:24.01]For me, I feel like the closer I do, like, a good jump on him, more likely.
[13:29.63]If you haven't done it in a while, you'll kind of get when you can do it.
[13:46.00]Oh, also... Oh, we got another guy.
[13:48.44]We got a fucking another monster.
[13:50.56]The offset attacks?
[13:52.68]What's that?
[13:54.04]If the enemy has a red sparkly spot, you do a shift attack.
[14:01.12]You do a mega combo on it.
[14:03.09]Gotcha, yeah.
[14:04.13]When you aim, right?
[14:05.93]I don't know what it is for range, though.
[14:08.07]It should say a focus assault, I think.
[14:11.11]A focus strike.
[14:16.85]Yeah.
[14:18.17]That looks pretty good, right, chat?
[14:23.66]Focus is not offset.
[14:25.96]Yeah, not offset.
[14:26.70]Offset is actually like a parry.
[14:28.69]Oh.
[14:29.47]I was wrong.
[14:30.23]But yeah, it's off... Focus is like the red spot.
[14:41.37]Where's my mail?
[14:47.31]Oh, I was... I was aiming.
[14:53.90]Oh my god.
[14:56.10]Dude, you better dodge those.
[15:04.22]Your father who slew dragons before you dodged those.
[15:11.79]Rathalos, you'll never defeat us.
[15:23.90]I think I can change the pigmentation on this.
[15:25.68]Don't do it!
[15:27.67]I got some with you.
[15:31.07]Bucked it up.
[15:31.57]Yeah, maybe I did.
[15:35.19]Maybe I don't need that.
[15:41.28]Oh, I'm out of food.
[15:42.16]I'm really hungry.
[15:44.54]Why can't I give you food?
[15:46.76]Well, I can eat some.
[15:48.90]I just more mean like the Giga food buff.
[15:54.25]Vinny complaining about story, then doing Barbie mode for 30 minutes.
[15:59.69]Barbie mode?
[16:03.16]I'm trying to make my character look cool, come on.
[16:06.26]That's the most important part.
[16:08.34]Yeah.
[16:09.32]Fashion Hunter.
[16:11.06]I regret fucking up my character's face.
[16:14.19]It's really bad.
[16:16.81]I do like your character's face, to be fair.
[16:19.45]I try to fix it, it's just... You'll see.
[16:30.64]Oh, cool move.
[16:32.18]Very good.
[16:38.02]And this, OK.
[16:38.96]Use monster parts to melt armor spells.
[16:42.34]I need to get soft about it.
[16:50.49]This is Rock Shad.
[16:52.37]Oh, something.
[16:59.68]he run he run to the tune of she bangs by ricky Martin so how many are after um rathalos um not many five ish am I going the right way is that wrong oh I think when you told me you fought the octopus I thought you were talking about a different one
[17:29.73]That was another octopus?
[17:31.49]The fire octopus?
[17:32.53]Yeah, there's another octopus later.
[17:34.45]Spoilers!
[17:35.59]That's a lot.
[17:41.42]This new update for Hello Kitty is neat.
[17:44.02]Like, right now, if you run off that edge, your character will jump in the air and you'd probably get on its back.
[17:49.58]Run off the edge?
[17:50.10]Yeah, do an attack.
[17:51.20]Yeah, if you, like, sprint off of the edge of that high ground, it makes your character jump over here.
[18:00.73]So you sprint off with no weapon, and then in the air you attack.
[18:04.95]Oh, you have a bow.
[18:05.65]I have no idea.
[18:06.53]Never mind.
[18:08.99]Oh, okay.
[18:09.31]Forgot that part.
[18:10.11]You know, put mantles.
[18:15.67]To the whetstone right here.
[18:16.53]Hopefully I don't die.
[18:20.46]Mantles are baby mode.
[18:28.86]We cut the tail off of Raffles.
[18:31.14]Yeah.
[18:36.40]Hey.
[18:38.98]How do you get decorations?
[18:41.34]Cool.
[18:44.56]Well, nice sleigh, guys.
[18:46.22]Go to equipment, press D-pad on right.
[18:54.58]Dude, last time we played, I was such a hater.
[18:59.05]It was rough.
[19:00.03]No, it was.
[19:01.41]This game is notorious for how obnoxious it is to do anything before you beat the game.
[19:08.16]But I did give it a real chance, and I like it now.
[19:10.54]Yeah, it's good.
[19:12.14]I mean, I crashed a lot.
[19:15.48]I still crash, but yeah.
[19:18.22]How's the stream performance?
[19:19.46]I know that for some reason this game looks bad through stream, but plays okay.
[19:24.63]It's weird.
[19:27.34]It's just the effects and bitrate.
[19:28.78]There's so much shit going on.
[19:39.37]I'm gonna write this down in my diary.
[19:42.35]Apparently, pierce coding makes it easier to mount.
[19:46.18]Interesting.
[19:53.32]Um...
[19:56.42]you set them in your forge or tent okay I feel like Vinny's gonna be there for an hour I don't know no no I'm already I'm riding the horse now and hearing them talk the dialogue I'm hearing from Vinny I don't know but don't we shouldn't change how you want to play Monster Hunter if you want to do that that's cool this person's a hunter uncle because we can do it we can do other shit too I am so good I'm almost ready I think at some point a monster is going to show up
[20:26.45]monster showing off you this way you can join now yeah oh cool okay what happened after I helped nata escape and blocked the passage oh I remember is the sight of that I just accepted your friend request I guess I awoke several days later more days passed before I was even like oh I'm like in a cutscene
[20:50.11]Trying to remember how to use the bow.
[20:58.73]Jeremy, are you using the bow?
[21:00.27]I am using the bow.
[21:01.17]Is that your primary?
[21:03.11]I would say it probably is, but I've been thinking of toying with the idea of going lance.
[21:11.44]Gotcha.
[21:12.38]Yeah, it's my secondary.
[21:13.50]I like it.
[21:18.30]once our wounds were healed we unblocked I had heard that they were selling out of like non-cheese in Japan or something that everyone's going Monster Hunter crazy because they like watching the cut scene so much and they all got really hungry and they ate the whole I think like the island is sinking now because they ate everything yeah it was a lot of none they ate and
[21:41.73]Oh, the cheese nods, right?
[21:43.31]Yeah.
[21:44.26]That's crazy.
[21:46.60]Dude, the food cut scenes are insane.
[21:50.24]It's crazy that a game like this has that much influence, that it can influence what people are going to eat in real life.
[21:55.66]Yeah.
[21:58.71]That's crazy.
[22:01.43]I'm hoping my horse doesn't kill me.
[22:03.91]The Marvel movie did it with the shawarmas, right?
[22:07.51]Did it?
[22:07.79]I remember that.
[22:08.85]There was the post credit scene.
[22:09.99]It made me want it.
[22:12.15]Shit.
[22:12.53]For sure.
[22:12.85]It made it popular as fuck.
[22:15.23]Look at some of this food looks really healthy.
[22:16.93]Maybe people will eat cabbage for once.
[22:19.23]I'm knocking him down.
[22:32.08]I got a major cutscene.
[22:35.30]Wait, what?
[22:39.46]oh that move is so cool sir it's really funny on one of the long dragons because it goes from head to tail and you're like a roller coaster down the whole dragon yeah I saw clip was insane it's really silly trying to remember how to use bow again so the bigger the mob more damage right it doesn't do a lot while it's moving but I guess so
[23:08.85]I don't know how, like, applying status effects or anything work in this game.
[23:12.17]You tried the hammer switch?
[23:13.33]The hammer axe?
[23:14.83]Or switch axe, I mean.
[23:16.74]No.
[23:17.06]That's my, I usually main that.
[23:18.90]That's a good one.
[23:20.14]I like it.
[23:20.64]I've been using it.
[23:21.72]Way more fun than the hammer.
[23:22.92]I'll try and land.
[23:25.38]See, I was using the hammer and I got bored.
[23:26.88]Hold LT and then RT and then press Y to ready a tracer.
[23:30.08]What button am I pressing?
[23:37.64]Oh, I'm pressing the wrong button.
[23:39.08]No wonder I couldn't figure out how to use a tracer.
[23:42.44]Do you guys get lost a lot when you're playing and just forgetting buttons and combos and shit?
[23:48.82]Yeah.
[23:50.90]Something about holding left trigger, right trigger, and then pressing triangle and circle at the same time is kind of scratching your head and rubbing your belly.
[23:59.69]Oh, you guys should use your F1 keys.
[24:01.75]I started using that for heals and stuff.
[24:04.55]It's so good.
[24:06.50]use a keyboard though oh yeah I forgot yeah no no shade I I think I think the keyboard's nice honestly I try both I really prefer the keyboard I think they made it pretty good because the way I play with it
[24:32.44]oh you learned about the wyvern milk yeah I've heard about that one too oh man what is that you don't want to know you'll see the dragon torch the source one of the cutscenes I missed I skipped
[24:47.50]only that it has existed since the white monsters seem to the key that you should see for yourselves that movie right there dude is so cool why is it that the keepers haven't been you see why viria fell a millennium of those our ancestors were doing the half skip through cutscene where the founders of this village you don't commit to skipping the whole thing but you just go one two three and then let it play for like a half minute and then do one two three what exactly did your ancestors do
[25:16.72]You're disrespecting the fine work they spent on those cutscenes?
[25:20.70]Yes.
[25:29.30]I want to make a good lance.
[25:30.44]Hey, what's a good lance to make?
[25:33.06]What's a, hey, that's a... Actually, you know what?
[25:34.93]I don't want to know.
[25:36.05]Because I want to do like a lightning one or ice one.
[25:38.47]I want to do an ice lance.
[25:39.51]Fuck yeah, let's go.
[25:43.15]Ice Lance goes pretty wacky.
[25:46.05]Oh, Ice Lance goes brr.
[25:49.37]I know.
[25:52.44]Brr.
[25:56.46]Are you guys still fighting?
[25:57.10]Are you guys playing over there still?
[25:58.88]Yeah.
[25:59.34]Yeah, we're fighting this guy.
[26:00.94]I probably shouldn't join because I'm going to join and you're going to kill it and I'm not even going to get there.
[26:04.18]It's going real well.
[26:05.66]He's probably about done.
[26:06.65]Let me make a lance.
[26:15.45]Where is... Is she not here?
[26:22.72]Nah, I'll just go back to town.
[26:31.42]Chad, do I have any more... Oh, Chad, sorry.
[26:35.06]You guys should test out this AI thing.
[26:39.98]You talk to this AI and it responds so fast.
[26:42.59]I saw you.
[26:43.41]I saw that.
[26:44.49]It's surreal.
[26:46.11]I was laughing so hard at one part where you told it to roleplay.
[26:50.09]I actually checked it out for a second.
[26:57.03]Just tell it to roleplay as Tourette's.
[27:00.57]See what happens.
[27:01.77]Okay.
[27:02.21]Okay.
[27:06.43]I took a look at it for a second and I said, um... What do you think of Vinesauce?
[27:11.85]And they were like, I love Vinesauce, Josh.
[27:15.21]So... Yeah.
[27:17.46]And then I just stopped.
[27:18.56]I was done.
[27:18.98]I was like, I'm good.
[27:21.94]AI scares the shit out of me.
[27:23.02]You know, I've never even used... I've never used chat GPT once.
[27:26.80]I've never asked it anything.
[27:27.86]I mean, I played, like, Call of Duty and the enemies would hide, but...
[27:39.23]LOL.
[27:42.76]I'm just afraid that if I use it... It scares the shit out of me because I know that it... Here's the thing, using it... You use it once and you go, oh, that was kind of... Well, I'm going to ask it everything now.
[27:55.89]I'm gonna ask it literally everything.
[27:57.39]And do I need a recipe?
[27:58.61]How do I make, like, two eggs over medium?
[28:00.71]I just ask that.
[28:01.61]I'm gonna ask it.
[28:02.19]I scroll past it in Google when you get that first result.
[28:06.13]Like, it says that my name is Vinny Melpert Vinesauce.
[28:10.32]Like, and it's, like, there's all these bizarre, like, incorrect facts that it spits out, and I just stopped using it.
[28:18.66]I saw, like, it was spitting out, like, bad information for people's health.
[28:22.73]of, like, you should rub oil on your wound.
[28:25.75]I can attest they gave me bad info on gout.
[28:29.21]Well, why would you use it for health, though?
[28:30.67]I feel like if you're using AI for health, that's, like, you're already fucked up.
[28:34.18]That's already fucked up.
[28:35.66]You know how people is.
[28:37.06]They see that.
[28:37.62]They're like, it must be right.
[28:39.60]First result.
[28:41.04]Ooh, I kind of want this.
[28:42.22]Yeah, first result for sure.
[28:44.34]I kind of like it because it's kind of wrong, and I like it's funny when it's wrong.
[28:51.79]That was the best part.
[28:52.91]Years ago, I would do, um, like, AI dungeon and, like, stuff that had AI for, like, creating, like, adventures and stories, and it was the funniest shit, because it would just break, and it would repeat the same things.
[29:07.68]Like, I remember one time it was telling me about the Maklanka,
[29:10.75]It was like you eat the McClanky and it was delicious.
[29:13.15]You eat the McClanky and you boil it.
[29:14.99]And it was just like repeating itself for hours.
[29:18.33]It was so stupid.
[29:19.33]I got a slime girl animation out of it, but now it's too good.
[29:23.74]And it's like, just, I don't know.
[29:27.02]Yeah.
[29:27.36]Chill out.
[29:29.50]It's stupid how good it is though.
[29:31.20]Like you can literally tell it to do anything.
[29:32.72]Yeah, but I wouldn't.
[29:41.19]Dude, I'm going to get this cool little... This is from the spider, right?
[29:44.45]This thing is awesome.
[29:45.71]I was going to do ice, but this is paralysis.
[29:48.31]And it's a lance.
[29:49.59]And it looks pretty sick.
[29:51.97]Oh, I like it a lot.
[30:05.86]Oh, there's the jewels.
[30:08.20]They're jewels, Betty.
[30:09.88]Jewels.
[30:12.24]Proud of you.
[30:13.42]That was an ominous encounter.
[30:14.80]I gotta learn how to use the lance.
[30:23.01]It really should have stayed at the weird fucked up psychedelic dream images.
[30:29.92]Yeah, when you watch, like, AI videos of people talking and doing things, now it feels like a dream, but a bad dream.
[30:40.55]And not a funny dream.
[30:41.93]Yeah, it used to be, yeah, it used to be a funny dream.
[30:45.01]Oh, look, here he is.
[30:46.11]Oh, here's somebody, like, their face is all messed up, and they're lifting weights, and they're on a skateboard, and their head is all squished in.
[30:53.58]Now it's kind of like a bad dream.
[31:00.46]Yeah, I'm less inclined.
[31:02.82]I liked it when Will Smith was eating spaghetti.
[31:05.90]It was, like, so bizarre, and now it just looks like Will Smith eating, like, spaghetti.
[31:10.38]Like, his finger might be missing, but other than that, like, it's pretty normal.
[31:14.40]It kind of reminds me of game graphics in a way, where video game graphics and movie CGI, right?
[31:20.79]it's look at how good it is look at how amazing it is look it looks just like real life I kind of don't want it to look like real life I kind of wanted to look scuffed and and interesting and I wanted to be made out of real real people to make the puppets and stuff and I don't know I agree game should look uh games like uh it sounds stupid but Overwatch was like the last one that I think is like you know what I'm saying like it looks so good it's something like
[31:50.63]I like games with their own style.
[31:52.25]I mean, I don't really care for Overwatch anymore, but I know what you mean.
[31:56.61]Oh, yeah, I know.
[31:57.53]If you look at it now, it still looks like its own... Looks unique, you know?
[32:03.02]Yeah, it's not just like ultra-realism that takes seven years to make.
[32:06.32]People don't care about that.
[32:08.84]They just make a game and just slap the fucking effects on it now.
[32:13.35]Yeah.
[32:15.18]We're one of those guys.
[32:16.28]Unreal Engine slop.
[32:18.48]Freaking Unreal Engine slop, man.
[32:21.78]Yeah.
[32:22.12]This thing's kind of good.
[32:24.90]No Concord.
[32:25.68]Sorry.
[32:28.36]Man, I thought he was talking to me.
[32:30.84]I almost was that one time.
[32:32.16]I'll get him next time.
[32:32.84]Yeah.
[32:38.46]D-A-E Engine slop.
[32:43.06]Does anyone else?
[32:47.19]Day.
[32:47.43]I just read it as day.
[32:49.51]Day.
[32:58.46]Right.
[32:58.94]Video games were so much better back in the 1990s and 1995s.
[33:03.22]Well, the cool thing about living now...
[33:05.86]I mean, there's not a lot, but sometimes there's some cool stuff.
[33:09.19]Wait, wait.
[33:11.07]Did you say the cool thing about living?
[33:14.37]Living now in the year of our Lord.
[33:16.37]There's not a lot of cool things about living.
[33:19.69]No, there's plenty.
[33:20.40]I was just joking around.
[33:21.90]The glasses.
[33:23.38]But we have access to all of the music and games and movies that have been made.
[33:29.31]Like, so when people are like, man, it was better in the 90s.
[33:31.96]It's like, go play Banjo Kazooie now.
[33:35.64]And it's easier to play than ever, too.
[33:37.06]Like, you could just play that.
[33:38.14]You could just play it right now on your, like, phone.
[33:41.18]So...
[33:42.06]Yeah.
[33:42.56]Yeah.
[33:43.54]It's not the same necessarily, but, you know, I go back and play a lot of games that are 90s, and I'm still, like, having fun with them.
[33:52.04]Shit, Rathalos is here.
[33:53.88]That's the one we did with Jerma, so you're good.
[33:56.28]It's just limitation, bro.
[33:58.28]I've been on Blockbuster every week for one game.
[34:00.02]You had to play it.
[34:01.99]Yeah, that's true.
[34:03.81]And I played plenty of stinkers.
[34:06.51]Cool Spot 7-Up game.
[34:08.95]No, no, no.
[34:09.69]Cool Spot was a good game.
[34:11.15]I was talking about the other day, Cool Spot was good.
[34:13.59]And then you rent something and you know it sucks, but you've rented it and you have friends over and you try to pretend that you like it because otherwise you've made a... what a bad rental that was.
[34:22.09]Then you're the jerk because you screwed up.
[34:24.74]Don't join my quest, join Vinny's.
[34:26.10]I just skip my shit.
[34:29.34]Just Skibidi?
[34:30.60]Yeah.
[34:31.00]So how do I do that?
[34:32.08]A communication or something?
[34:33.00]How do I join his game without... If Vinny's ahead though, just do your stuff.
[34:38.83]We're in the same.
[34:41.13]Jerma's now worth caught up, I believe.
[34:43.13]Yeah, I'm caught up.
[34:44.49]This is Rathalos again.
[34:45.63]You would press escape and go to the link party somewhere, communication, one of those menus.
[34:53.26]Communication and invitation list, and you should see a quest invitation from Phoenix.
[34:58.74]There it is, hell yeah.
[35:01.95]How do I rain hell from the sky again?
[35:11.24]R when you have a full shot loaded, maybe?
[35:14.38]LT.
[35:16.27]Oh, not R. Both circles and then A. Thank you.
[35:28.15]The thing I forget to do most.
[35:32.46]This thing is different than a Wraithian, right?
[35:36.04]I think, from what I remember, the Wrathion or Wraithion was the female of the species.
[35:41.70]Okay, okay.
[35:43.66]Damn, you know your shit.
[35:44.40]A little bit.
[35:46.14]He's a Monster Hunter fan.
[35:50.73]You're probably the world's biggest Monster Hunter fan, right?
[35:54.15]That's right.
[35:55.65]I almost played a couple of them almost all the way through.
[36:02.01]That's true though, because I would consider myself a fan of these games and I've probably beaten one of them.
[36:06.73]Yeah, exactly.
[36:08.13]Alright, good luck.
[36:13.24]I've never even played with this weapon, so I hope I don't do terrible.
[36:15.30]Didn't you finish Monster Hunter: World?
[36:20.24]Yeah, no, I finished them.
[36:21.28]I don't, like, you know... Sometimes I don't end up going too far beyond the high rank stuff.
[36:36.57]That's where it's at.
[36:37.79]That's where it's really at.
[36:39.95]It is.
[36:43.72]We can parry too, right?
[36:45.92]Yeah.
[36:47.00]There's also a perfect time block with the spear and stuff.
[36:51.64]I think I did it.
[37:12.01]I do have a Razzalos plushie, so I guess I am a pretty big fan.
[37:17.27]When's the last time you slept with it?
[37:23.03]How big of a fan are you, really?
[37:26.09]I also have, you know the meat spit from the previous games?
[37:29.16]Maybe you don't Ster, but it was like when you would make food on your own, it would just be like a comical meat.
[37:37.14]I have that plushie as well.
[37:40.65]I got that at the PAX East, I think I met you at, Jerma, I'm pretty sure.
[37:47.43]How many millions of dollars do you think they make on their little merchandise, do you think?
[37:54.33]Not as much as Sanrio Hello Kitty stuff as I've learned recently, but a lot.
[37:58.98]A lot, lot.
[38:00.60]Especially in Japan.
[38:03.10]Monster Hunter was so big back in... I remember that shit, because I used to go to PAX East all the time.
[38:08.12]All the Paxes.
[38:09.52]Wait, really?
[38:10.18]All the Paxes, yeah.
[38:11.26]And we never met?
[38:12.67]I was... No, I was just a random dude.
[38:14.79]I used to go as a random dude.
[38:17.45]Back in the day.
[38:18.17]I was just a... I wasn't a content creator yet.
[38:22.31]I waited in lines.
[38:25.22]You met me?
[38:26.70]I don't think I met you.
[38:28.82]Probably.
[38:31.18]I think I was a big Mega64 fan.
[38:34.32]Oh, I love those guys.
[38:35.92]It's so weird, like, you never know.
[38:38.72]Like, what if you were... Because you kind of just don't remember.
[38:42.76]What if we were out of packs together and just didn't know each other, would never put the long-term memory into the bank, and, like, you cut me in line or, like, I cut you in line or something, and you just were like, fuck that guy.
[38:54.59]He's just waiting for an excuse to, like, be mad at one of you guys.
[38:58.67]Could be.
[38:59.29]Yeah, but you just won't even remember.
[39:00.53]Like, what if I cut you in line at PAX East?
[39:04.32]And you just... Like, that guy's... What a prick.
[39:08.36]Well, you did, but I don't want to bring it up, but... I DM'd you about it, but...
[39:15.15]I actually do have a story, a cut-and-line story.
[39:18.87]I might have told you, Jerma, but poke and Ster.
[39:22.23]You know what?
[39:22.61]Maybe I didn't.
[39:24.80]This is for me and Ster.
[39:25.78]Jerma, don't listen.
[39:26.64]Yeah, Jerma, don't listen.
[39:28.46]I was getting pizza at Joe's in New York City, and it's a place where you wait outside because it gets kind of busy, and you go in, you grab some slices.
[39:38.18]And this was after I went to sleep no more with Pluto, who is a Twitch dude, years ago.
[39:45.13]And we're waiting in line, it's raining, it's cold, it sucks out.
[39:50.21]And Clito's like, dude, look, it's Lil Dicky.
[39:54.07]I'm like, who the fuck is Lil Dicky?
[39:55.98]He's a rapper, he's a popular rapper.
[39:57.54]I'm like, okay.
[39:59.20]So I see Lil Dicky get on line, a couple people behind us.
[40:03.02]Someone in the front of the line recognizes him.
[40:05.88]Lil Dicky goes over to him and is like, yo, what up?
[40:08.04]Pretends he knows him.
[40:09.91]They talk for all of 20 seconds, then little Dickie just stays there.
[40:16.07]So he effectively used his fame to cut the pizza line.
[40:20.25]So he did a stop and chat.
[40:21.57]He did a Larry David stop and chat?
[40:23.05]He did.
[40:23.59]It was a Larry David moment.
[40:24.73]He stopped and chatted with a fan, and then he pretended he knew him, and then just stayed there online and got his pizza first.
[40:31.31]That's funny.
[40:31.93]That's well played.
[40:34.43]I told the story on stream, and it got kind of a lot of...
[40:38.12]views on the clip and I was like, listen guys, I don't want to start a beef with little Dicky.
[40:42.06]Really, it's fine.
[40:42.74]Yeah, because it sounds like a Reddit post.
[40:46.67]Yeah, I met this guy at the grocery store.
[40:49.57]He was like, huh, huh, huh, huh.
[40:53.82]Oh, like you're doing now?
[40:56.62]Yeah, I know what me and Jerma waited in line to play.
[41:00.65]That's funny.
[41:01.22]Evolve?
[41:02.14]Yeah.
[41:02.98]That was worth it.
[41:03.92]Really, Evolve?
[41:05.06]Yeah, that's the kind of shit we're working on.
[41:07.94]They had a crazy booth.
[41:09.72]They had a crazy booth.
[41:10.48]We were there.
[41:10.96]We were both in line.
[41:12.79]Yeah, we remember that.
[41:15.17]I don't think we... That was fairly early on, right?
[41:19.87]Yeah.
[41:20.37]I don't know if it was like, oh, maybe we get an invite to check it out.
[41:24.78]I don't think that had happened.
[41:26.38]It did not.
[41:28.85]I just remember having a vague memory of, like, the Borderlands booth being the loudest shit ever, and I just would think... I would think I feel bad for anyone next to them.
[41:36.96]Yeah, that happens.
[41:38.62]Because they have to hear that shit 24-7.
[41:39.86]It's just ruined.
[41:42.85]Wait, Borderlands and Obnoxious?
[41:45.01]No.
[41:46.11]I remember they just had the most craziest, loudest booth ever.
[41:52.73]And Booth Babes.
[41:54.39]Oh yeah, wow.
[41:55.38]I haven't thought of that in a while.
[41:56.54]I think those are banned now.
[42:00.16]Look at what they've taken from us.
[42:04.51]Meanwhile, you look around, everyone in cosplay is just like half naked anyway.
[42:08.17]It's crazy.
[42:08.65]There's so many companies that are like, hey, just come here and take a picture with hot women.
[42:12.51]That was it.
[42:13.67]E3 was all just like, I remember seeing the magazines I would like get like EGM.
[42:19.08]It's like, alright, here's two pages on the games and here's the booth babes.
[42:25.28]True as fuck.
[42:26.70]What was the point?
[42:27.40]It worked.
[42:29.48]It worked, yeah.
[42:38.35]Don't let it escape.
[42:39.29]Oh wait, now that's the opposite of what you want to do.
[42:47.88]Remember when they drove a car on stage at E3?
[42:50.44]Yeah, there was like... When I was covering E3, like eventually we would do bingo.
[42:55.74]And one of them was like, someone drives a car or motor vehicle onto the stage.
[43:00.28]And inevitably it would happen.
[43:02.71]Whether it be a Lego car or a motorcycle.
[43:06.59]Ferrari for like a Forza game or something.
[43:08.49]I don't even have a fucking whetstone equipped.
[43:12.49]Wait, how is that possible?
[43:13.97]Raw dog.
[43:14.47]You're raw dogging.
[43:15.96]Oh, no, I got it.
[43:16.46]I got it.
[43:19.25]So whetstones were not... You go ahead first.
[43:22.55]Go ahead.
[43:22.91]No, no, no.
[43:23.81]Mine's very dumb.
[43:24.69]I promise.
[43:25.79]No, mine's stupid.
[43:26.53]Go ahead.
[43:28.86]Let's go at the same time.
[43:29.68]Ready?
[43:30.26]I'm muted.
[43:34.46]I wanted to go back and watch old E3s and see how the announcements compare and did the game come out?
[43:40.42]Was the game any good when it came out?
[43:41.62]What was the hype like?
[43:42.89]Go watch like 2002 E3.
[43:43.69]Just like react to it.
[43:48.17]That's not a bad idea.
[43:49.61]It's way better than my Whetstone question.
[43:53.50]Especially lately, like, the E3 stuff.
[43:57.96]Yeah, it feels like it was more exciting.
[43:59.72]But you know what, Jerma?
[44:01.05]The one that I'll always point to as my favorite E3 moment was the Zelda Twilight Princess reveal.
[44:08.25]People lost their fucking minds.
[44:12.09]Like 20 years ago.
[44:12.83]That was my favorite one.
[44:14.07]I'm not going to get any loot for this because my guy was not on the auto track anymore.
[44:17.61]He's just decided to go with... How come I'm not auto following the way the monster is?
[44:24.86]He's dead now.
[44:25.50]I think.
[44:29.27]I'll get there.
[44:31.23]What was the reveal?
[44:31.95]What did they do?
[44:33.80]No, they just had... People were starved for a realistic Zelda and they just showed it.
[44:38.80]I'll link the video because it's just a two minute trailer and you see the audience lose their mind.
[44:43.43]And Miyamoto goes on stage with a sword.
[44:46.03]And it was just like after Wind Waker, the adult baby gamers wanted a realistic Zelda.
[44:51.39]And so it was just very exciting.
[44:57.48]I must have pressed the wrong button, because I didn't even get any items.
[45:02.48]I was just talking, we were just having a good time, and I thought I was auto-following the road, but apparently I was going the other direction.
[45:09.10]Everything's ruined now.
[45:12.44]Well, we're caught up to you, Germont.
[45:15.38]Yeah, both of us now have the same quest.
[45:21.31]Oh, but that makes it awkward, where you have to both see it, and then one of you goes to the other person.
[45:30.51]But whatever.
[45:33.81]Wait, how does it work?
[45:34.99]We both have to start doing it?
[45:37.10]You have to see the monster and start the fight before you can join the other person.
[45:42.66]Yeah.
[45:43.62]You have to have seen the boss.
[45:47.64]So if we both go... I'm starting it right now, I think.
[45:52.85]Wait, you skipped everything?
[45:53.97]You don't have to skip so hard.
[45:57.85]No, I just started the cutscene, I think.
[46:01.30]I want them to make a zelda like gears of war you know what I mean what like that is they need that level of graphics like that's an adult zelda yeah I want link to be like a jacked barbarian
[46:23.89]I just want them to make a Zelda card game and just put all their money into it.
[46:27.49]Let me play as Ganondorf and let me stomp someone's head into the ground.
[46:33.85]I would play, I mean, they're doing Final Fantasy Magic, The Gathering, which is exciting for me.
[46:39.38]So, Zelda cards would be cool.
[46:42.70]And fight Goku.
[46:44.44]Why is Goku in this hypothetical Zelda?
[46:51.17]I feel like if I'm making demands, you gotta aim high, and then they pull back, and then you get what you actually wanted.
[46:56.81]Which was the fuck did you do?
[46:57.61]Start with Goku, get Gohan.
[46:59.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:00.53]I see.
[47:01.75]Dude, I hate marathoning a show, and then, like, it replays the intro.
[47:07.25]Every time.
[47:08.01]I'm so sick of that.
[47:08.59]In game shows, specifically.
[47:09.91]Are you talking about Severance?
[47:12.63]Severance isn't too bad, but, like, I was trying to watch Dragon Ball.
[47:16.62]and man like the the outro the singing and the intro singing like it felt like every it was like half the watching you know what I mean yeah I was watching like a stream that was replay like doing a 24-hour Dragon Ball marathon which is it wasn't possible yeah I don't know there's something I'm thinking about been on the brain a little too much lately
[47:43.81]dude they do that in game shows and it's so annoying when they tell you the rules of the game and this is like the 500th episode of this game show I already know the rules you don't have to explain them to me every time they could fit like three whole questions in like an episode an extra three questions if they don't explain the rules like I know that how many questions it is till you get to the beast uh and I know exactly how you lock it in you don't have to tell me every time
[48:12.97]don't die of natural causes not as long as they continue to consume the wyvern milk ever since wyveria fell the guardians stayed fighting a monster I forgot to skip the cut scenes oh wyvern milk this place is rich in wyvern milk they have all the sustenance they could ever need
[48:35.45]Yet Arkveld escaped to the outside world.
[48:39.92]Do you think we would do good at family feuds together?
[48:42.86]We were one of the families.
[48:44.12]I think we all have a separate knowledge pool.
[48:47.32]I think it would be good.
[48:48.66]Yeah, I don't know.
[48:51.52]Is there like an online family feud?
[48:53.48]Like we're going on?
[48:54.32]Steve Harvey said it's cool.
[48:55.51]Who are we challenging?
[48:57.69]Attack the village.
[48:59.35]I don't know the Smiths.
[49:01.35]Ludwig and them?
[49:02.65]Ludwig.
[49:03.15]You want to get a family food challenge?
[49:09.41]Isn't there a Jackbox?
[49:10.61]Doesn't Jackbox do that kind of?
[49:12.23]This is a cool new Jackbox with the survey stuff.
[49:17.87]It's fun.
[49:18.15]We should do Jackbox one day.
[49:26.26]Yeah, I had a fun Jackbox recent.
[49:30.26]I don't know what that sentence was, but yes, I'd be down.
[49:36.89]Do it against Ludwig, Squeaks, and others.
[49:45.78]You know what's cool about Squeaks?
[49:48.48]He's actually a New York guy.
[49:50.72]It's like, finally, there's another, like, dude that streams that lives in New York.
[49:56.22]I love Skleeks.
[49:58.00]Yeah, he's really funny.
[50:00.82]Good guy.
[50:02.02]Yeah, he's awesome.
[50:05.42]He's a good dude.
[50:07.22]No, of course, Mike.
[50:08.58]No, chat, I didn't forget Mike.
[50:10.14]I've known the guy for 40 years.
[50:11.52]That's not true.
[50:12.64]20.
[50:15.30]Just bring up everyone from New York that he just forgot about.
[50:17.72]Just bring them all up now.
[50:18.94]Please.
[50:19.48]Please do.
[50:22.22]I was in New York once.
[50:23.24]Do I count?
[50:23.82]Sorry.
[50:25.58]I mean, you grew up in New Jersey.
[50:28.98]Close enough, man.
[50:31.26]I grew up in Boston.
[50:33.31]You hated me, though.
[50:35.19]You guys would have hated me.
[50:37.81]I don't get the feud because I wasn't into baseball, so I wasn't programmed into disliking you.
[50:42.73]I was definitely programmed into disliking you, for sure.
[50:48.03]Listen, I grew up liking the Yankees because my dad told me that was what I had to do.
[50:53.43]So yeah, we were enemies.
[51:02.36]For me, it was soccer.
[51:04.06]For me, it was just soccer.
[51:04.86]I had to be a Brazil fan.
[51:07.17]Are you a soccer fan?
[51:08.97]Football fan?
[51:09.33]Not really anymore, no.
[51:10.49]When I was younger.
[51:15.51]But, dude, soccer is huge as fuck.
[51:18.37]It's so big.
[51:19.99]It's crazy because it really wasn't, at least in the United States, it really wasn't a huge, huge deal, I don't think, at least 20 years ago or so.
[51:28.18]yeah yeah is it like the NBA times like five or some it's like 10 times 10 or something like in terms of fans and size monstrous now it's huge yeah it's like way bigger than what we imagined anything in a so big yeah my bad for saying soccer football
[51:54.26]It makes it easy.
[51:54.88]It just kind of makes it easy.
[51:58.26]Still has a lot of room to grow in the U.S.
[51:59.50]too.
[51:59.66]Yeah, it did.
[52:00.22]I mean, it's seeing very expansive growth.
[52:03.83]I'm surprised.
[52:06.19]What is the U.S.
[52:08.45]soccer teams, the Major League Soccer, is that popular or is it more of the international contests and stuff?
[52:16.70]Uh, international.
[52:17.54]I think NA stuff is... Still not that popular, right?
[52:20.48]No one really cares for it, I think.
[52:21.92]Wait, whose quest am I joining?
[52:24.37]I just saw the monster, and I can chill and be ready, or you can join me.
[52:28.29]I'm ready.
[52:28.97]I also just saw the monster.
[52:30.37]Oh, alright.
[52:31.01]Well, where did it go?
[52:32.37]How do I join?
[52:32.95]Whoever's safer.
[52:34.39]Who's safer right now?
[52:38.07]I'm safe.
[52:38.47]I'm good.
[52:39.49]Okay, so join Binny.
[52:41.39]Okay, I'm... Okay, then I'm joining... I'm joining Jerma.
[52:45.47]I'm joining Jerma.
[52:46.15]Perfect.
[52:49.27]I'm just blocking.
[52:51.87]I can... Whoa, what am I doing?
[52:52.77]I'm fighting him.
[52:54.55]That was cool.
[52:56.23]We were doing like a test of strength together.
[53:03.86]Oh, it's called MLS for America.
[53:09.30]See, I don't even know that.
[53:10.56]It sounds like a disease.
[53:11.96]Yeah.
[53:18.23]They got to change the name.
[53:23.43]Just redo the whole thing.
[53:26.23]Major League Soccer.
[53:27.21]I love sports ball.
[53:31.81]I mean, I want tennis.
[53:32.99]You just want to.
[53:39.12]Hello.
[53:43.76]We just want major league ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong.
[54:01.40]We still gotta do the VR stream.
[54:02.52]Make sure you guys get that shit up.
[54:04.77]I keep wanting to.
[54:06.11]I got recommended so many cool worlds too recently.
[54:08.95]Really?
[54:09.21]And I just keep forgetting to do it.
[54:12.63]Get your list going.
[54:14.27]Save a list for us.
[54:15.41]I have a huge list, and several of my mods are very, very knowledgeable about VRChat.
[54:21.99]So we would have a really good VR.
[54:24.98]Yeah, I'm excited.
[54:26.14]Because every time I play, there's always something that blows my fucking mind that wasn't there like a year ago.
[54:30.88]Exactly.
[54:31.30]It's been so long, right?
[54:32.96]Yeah.
[54:33.48]It's got to be crazy now, for sure.
[54:34.88]It's got to be good.
[54:39.52]I can't wait until we're all in the metaverse.
[54:42.63]Remember how cool it looked with the Eiffel Tower and Zuck?
[54:45.73]Like, he looked so real.
[54:50.57]I just want more land in the metaverse.
[54:55.56]Now I'm going to get rich with Atlas Urk or whatever he says.
[54:59.64]Crypto Luigi.
[55:01.02]Not you too, though, Jerma.
[55:02.24]Why do you know that?
[55:04.40]Hey, I'm a fan, man.
[55:08.49]Wow, Crypto Luigi fan, we found the first one.
[55:20.02]If Crypto Luigi has one fan, then it's me.
[55:26.36]I definitely have to learn some combos because it's kind of just pocket and pressing triangle.
[55:31.86]My experience with Spear was that you do like heavy attack, heavy attack,
[55:37.62]And then you do light attack three times, and it does, like, three small posts, and, like, that was the depth of that weapon.
[55:42.78]I mean, it seems to be doing pretty good damage.
[55:45.12]Like, 20 to 30 a hit when it crits.
[55:47.43]It does.
[55:49.15]Did you see the, like, you can do the full run with it?
[55:52.33]Yeah, you can sprint around.
[55:55.17]Oof.
[56:12.39]I got into a cool test of sprinkling before, I don't know how I did it.
[56:16.57]Uh, I think that just happens against some attacks when you do like a time block.
[56:21.95]Oh shit, scripted.
[56:27.63]Nani?
[56:27.87]Yeah, what's your guys' favorite monster so far?
[56:37.29]I have been talking a lot about Senator Rom Pompolo.
[56:43.44]I actually, that was going to be mine too, or the octopus.
[56:46.66]I think the first octopus is, I just love that monster.
[56:49.34]It's so cool.
[56:51.44]Did you see the cat's gear for the first octopus?
[56:56.59]No, wait, what was it?
[56:59.19]When you get back to the base, I want you to check something out if you have a moment.
[57:04.83]Yeah, what's the... It's hilarious.
[57:08.64]It's honestly really funny.
[57:09.96]Yeah.
[57:11.38]If you do Palico equipment, scroll down to that octopus and check out the cat version.
[57:19.91]oh you do you're you're waiting thank you ah my bad the strength now this man has taste it is ideas very excited about it it's worth being excited about what arkfeld was doing yes it was feeding it's unprecedented might be time for me to make a new bow where did it learn this behavior
[57:43.74]very close to the end by the way like it really is like four bosses and if not what is it in danger you can probably hold back on crafting new stuff until then I'm definitely gonna want to eat some food soon here not that I'm aware yeah I wouldn't care much about your upgrades until you get to me I feel like nothing really feels strong until you get the high rank
[58:05.32]Okay.
[58:06.22]You have to be in the same lobby to see each other at camp.
[58:10.50]I guess it doesn't matter while we're doing all this stuff, right?
[58:15.17]There's no car if we just... Oh, okay.
[58:16.17]Oh, man, the armor looks awesome.
[58:24.10]Oh, my God.
[58:34.68]I don't know how to talk to her and it sounds like they built a base camp in that secret place uh in your tent the tab all the way to the right is like equipment appearance that might be it they might have info to share too
[59:01.06]Oh, high rank and low rank is different for Trasmog.
[59:05.10]Okay, that makes sense.
[59:10.75]Oh.
[59:12.57]Frontiers.
[59:18.09]So, Ice Shard Clips.
[59:21.35]I think I'm good for one more, and then I want to get some dinner.
[59:25.22]Oh, okay.
[59:26.96]You'll be late.
[59:29.11]Do you normally eat this late?
[59:31.49]I missed eating dinner earlier.
[59:33.13]That's why.
[59:34.27]Oh.
[59:36.57]I guess it's kind of an awkward time.
[59:38.53]What, for you, it's 5pm that we stream?
[59:41.93]Usually I eat well before, but I didn't get a chance to eat.
[59:46.34]I had food earlier this morning and into the afternoon, but...
[59:58.11]Yeah, I'm down for one more.
[60:01.63]How do we get to the ice shark?
[60:04.89]Are we there?
[60:07.67]I will arrive.
[60:08.35]And then I will end stream and eat whale.
[60:16.88]What?
[60:17.26]I don't know what that means.
[60:21.64]Ooh, there it is.
[60:42.85]I can't believe they're adding motorcycles to this game.
[60:44.63]I can't wait.
[60:48.81]That's what Capcom should have done.
[60:50.35]They should have drove a motorcycle up onto the stage for the Monster Hunter Wilds reveal.
[60:55.54]Jay Leno could have been driving it.
[60:57.25]They should have had a dragon on stage.
[61:00.73]You know, I watched a Jay Leno headlines compilation and I got to admit, I laughed at least four or five times.
[61:09.35]Yeah, it's not that he wasn't, he had good moments.
[61:14.65]I mean, he was consistently the most popular late night host beating out Letterman, which I don't understand, but you know, whatever.
[61:27.50]I didn't really watch a whole lot of all those shows that kind of blended.
[61:31.46]I remember Craig Ferguson though.
[61:32.52]I liked Craig Ferguson's show.
[61:34.78]Yeah.
[61:35.68]I thought he was cool.
[61:37.10]I like Conan.
[61:39.10]Conan and Craig are my two.
[61:42.16]And Lennon.
[61:43.50]Lennon.
[61:44.94]Wrong guy.
[61:46.48]Letterman was pretty influential too.
[61:49.66]And then Leno was just kind of there.
[61:51.49]He's like, alright fellas, what do you want to do?
[61:53.09]You want to talk about cars a little bit?
[61:54.93]I don't know, whatever.
[61:56.77]Whatever floats your boat.
[61:57.81]Oh my god, I fell forever.
[62:00.71]Are we talking about favorite late night people?
[62:03.09]Yeah.
[62:03.85]Conan was my guy.
[62:05.41]Yeah.
[62:06.23]Yeah, no, Conan, I'm still, I listen to his podcast a lot.
[62:09.29]I might start, might start listening to it.
[62:12.39]It's worth it.
[62:13.23]He's as good as he's ever been.
[62:14.61]I feel like he's always great.
[62:20.62]Yes.
[62:22.51]+2 +2 how do I get out of here where's the where's this where's this ice shard clips oh so you go to map and then press like x or something that'll take you to the world map oh it's wow I thought you could walk there okay oh right right right conan wrote some of the best Simpsons back yo you mentioned The Simpsons yeah conan was he did the monorail episode in particular
[62:54.17]Was Conan an early SNL writer, too, or am I misremembering that?
[62:59.71]Early by today's standards, but I think he was there late 80s into early 90s before he got The Simpsons gig.
[63:07.70]Him and Bob Odenkirk wrote for SNL.
[63:10.36]Like, they wrote together.
[63:11.94]Yeah.
[63:14.38]So... Yeah, that's right, Chet.
[63:19.78]Did you know... Here's one.
[63:22.35]Bob Odenkirk, who is Saul Goodman, wrote the Van Down by the River sketch for Chris Farley.
[63:27.30]Yeah, that's amazing.
[63:29.44]That was his... Never seen that one.
[63:34.20]50 years ago by today's standards.
[63:36.51]Are you going to...
[63:39.89]it's funny because when I was thinking like no it's not early snl but by that point like 89 snl was only on the air for like 14 years so now it's 50. so it's just man I've been talked about before crazy that's why we need to find a walnut cake we bumped into it that's so weird do you think it's gonna get to 100 ready to go um Lauren Lauren will be 128 but yes yes it will
[64:07.69]he will be a skeleton he'll be like the rise of a lot of online media and different avenues to find funny comedians they all used to funnel through SNL or one of the like the what the Second City or the Groundlings Second City, SCTV yeah you don't really need to do that anymore it's you can just be a comedian and be online and you're a comedy guy you don't really need SNL just harass a couple people on the street and you can get yourself big on YouTube
[64:39.09]good enough but yeah it is uh um my mods are just saying too it is it is crazy that it survived through youtube because they they pivoted hard to youtube like I remember 15 years ago they weren't you couldn't find their stuff now they upload that shit like the night of yeah and they found a way to like get it real memeable and clippable and
[65:01.66]I think they've got some exclusive deal where they're able to sell snl skits as like real news because that shows up everywhere like you will not believe the take they had on this last night no other show gets that yeah no it does kind of pretty heavily go around
[65:23.05]For better or worse, by the way, because a lot of modern SNL I just don't really care for.
[65:27.79]But I like the Mike Myers, Chris Farley era.
[65:31.69]Dana Carvey a lot.
[65:33.09]Adam Sandler, yeah.
[65:35.61]Norm Macdonald.
[65:37.39]Norm is, like, the best.
[65:39.71]I don't, like, he's the best best.
[65:41.65]Kevin Nealon.
[65:43.33]Love Kevin Nealon.
[65:46.23]You guys doing a quest?
[65:47.23]I'm doing a quest and I'm doing a cutscene.
[65:50.65]Yeah.
[65:51.93]I'm just fishing.
[65:53.75]I should be fishing.
[65:56.03]Don't skip cutscene.
[65:58.71]Oh.
[66:00.47]I don't even know where I can fish.
[66:01.59]I don't even know how to fish.
[66:03.33]Apparently if you fish in Area 17, you get better whetstone.
[66:07.66]I don't know... What?
[66:10.74]The one with the aliens?
[66:12.90]I don't know.
[66:13.34]Or Team 17 worms people?
[66:15.92]Maybe I get one guide.
[66:21.57]don't know the path is self-evident so so this whole part of the game is like my chat like loving it they say this is the best part of the game so I don't know how is it a long time chat because Jerm is hungry oh yeah you guys are getting like 17 cut scenes in a row right now aren't you we might be

[67:29.96]Well, we can just camp out then.
[67:32.32]If you want to join in mine, it's all good.
[67:39.68]Oh, it's a repel quest.
[67:40.70]Repel means you don't get loot, right?
[67:43.28]I think you get loot, you just don't kill.
[67:44.96]Oh, wait, it drops loot, but you don't get to the carcass, whatever.
[67:49.06]Yeah.
[67:52.10]Yeah, this thing's weird.
[67:55.74]Oh, this is the thing.
[67:56.98]This is the roller coaster for daggers.
[68:00.19]Oh, shit.
[68:01.31]What does that mean?
[68:03.85]I'm going to poke your voice.
[68:05.29]My voice?
[68:05.99]What happened?
[68:06.83]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[68:11.13]It's freezing the ground to secure its footing I think I'm knocking it down We have to stop it don't stop no matter what Say I'm riding the roller coaster I get it Oh stop That was close
[68:38.99]He gets it.
[68:39.85]Is this the dragon, sir, with the one move?
[68:44.53]Uh, yes.
[68:46.55]Okay.
[68:47.53]Have you guys ever done Shadow of the Colossus?
[68:48.79]Because they're streamed.
[68:49.72]Shadow of the Colossus.
[68:50.40]Is it a good stream game, do you think?
[68:52.88]Oh, definitely.
[68:54.68]Remaster?
[68:57.04]The remaster's really good.
[68:58.22]I played both.
[68:59.52]Yeah, I think it's a good stream game.
[69:01.10]Yeah, I loved it.
[69:02.66]I loved that game.
[69:03.89]Cool.
[69:04.55]Because I played the original a long time ago.
[69:07.09]I just didn't know how they remade it.
[69:09.70]The remake is excellent.
[69:11.22]I'm looking for good retro games.
[69:14.58]Dude, I could give you... I could be your retro game dealer.
[69:16.15]I could give you a fucking list of... You know when, like, the jokey things where they pull up the thing and it just, like, it falls down and they pull the big scroll out and it just hits the ground?
[69:26.05]From, like, medieval times?
[69:26.91]Give me some.
[69:28.51]I could give you one of those old games on it.
[69:30.37]Many probably, too.
[69:31.11]Did you ever play Super Metroid?
[69:34.64]Uh, when I was younger.
[69:35.34]It was okay.
[69:38.48]It's my second favorite game of all time.
[69:42.40]But I might be biased.
[69:43.54]I don't know.
[69:44.08]I just like Metroid a lot.
[69:46.62]Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
[69:49.03]What's up?
[69:49.45]Yeah, I think I got like... I just like 3D more.
[69:53.19]You know, like the... I mean, Metroid is 3D, but like... Metroid Prime Remastered.
[70:02.50]I'll just keep recommending Metroids.
[70:04.06]No, I have plenty of recommendations.
[70:06.26]There's a lot of good stuff.
[70:08.04]I really liked Metroid when I was younger, when we turned the ball on GameCube.
[70:12.41]That's Prime.
[70:12.99]Yeah, that one was really good.
[70:15.61]And on the 3DS, it was ahead of its time on the 3DS, right?
[70:20.09]With the PvP online.
[70:21.19]Yeah, the DS.
[70:22.09]Yeah, the Hunters, yeah.
[70:23.89]That shit was ahead of its time.
[70:25.89]It's great, yeah.
[70:27.74]Yeah, if you have specific genres you're looking for, I might be able to throw you a recommendation.
[70:33.88]Poke, I would pay good money to watch you play any FMV game on the fucking 3DO or the CDI.
[70:43.14]What about that one, um... You played it on Steam?
[70:48.31]It's like an FMV... Yeah, they ported a lot of them to Steam.
[70:53.59]Murder One?
[70:55.19]Deadly Premonition?
[70:56.97]No, I played that one.
[70:57.99]I love that game.
[70:59.81]Harvester?
[71:01.21]I think, yeah, Harvester.
[71:02.27]Harvester is a twisted-ass game.
[71:03.35]It's like fully unhinged.
[71:04.85]I've never played Harvester.
[71:06.75]Yeah, okay, Harvester is one of the most off-putting games ever.
[71:10.93]It's a point-and-click adventure game, but it's just, it's so awful and so off-putting, and there's things you can do in it that are just so terrible, and I would say you could, you'd probably get some good content out of that, but be aware it is like a fucking wild-ass experience.
[71:29.11]It's like a really bad experience in a way.
[71:31.97]I've heard something similar about the game Fear and Hunger.
[71:34.91]Is that what it's called?
[71:37.40]you guys heard of it I don't know that one it's like a it's like a what's it called those uh RPG maker games yeah Vinny did you play that what did you see play fear and hunger I don't know I swear I saw somebody clear
[71:58.83]I'm hearing a lot of people saying that it's like very unhinged or but like it's just like really creepy and creepy yeah the the way that those old games were it's old horror fnb creep and you you will a few points you will go wow like chills will go down your spine just how bizarre it is yeah Jerma what will you say huh
[72:27.27]while you're playing it about what the developers want it you're you're not that sad oh oh oh oh okay it's wicked up yeah hey I did I haven't eaten much today you're right could have caught that one
[72:50.26]And you can just tell that when they were making that game, they were just saying how fucked up this is.
[72:59.06]People are gonna think that.
[73:03.34]I wish there was more Banjo-Kazooies.
[73:06.18]Oh, no, not Banjo.
[73:07.82]Conker's Bedforday.
[73:09.51]Oh, yeah.
[73:10.15]Conker was one.
[73:12.38]Didn't they do a weird bait and switch where they said, here we go, Conker is back, and he was a character in a Minecraft kind of game they made?
[73:20.68]It was like Hololens.
[73:24.90]It was like young Conker.
[73:27.28]Project Spark, I believe.
[73:28.54]Yes, there it is.
[73:29.42]Then they tried to make him an AR character.
[73:34.08]It was a nightmare.
[73:34.77]As a huge Conker fan growing up, I've just given up.
[73:39.65]You have a new Conker fan because I played it last year.
[73:43.43]And I always saw the game when I was younger.
[73:46.43]I just thought I was too young for it, even when I was young.
[73:50.61]Looking at the box.
[73:52.31]Yeah, I'm not playing that.
[73:53.95]Platformers like that?
[73:55.67]Yeah.
[73:57.09]Mario loved it you might like um god I don't know if I want to recommend it but I just played donkey kong 64 with like a mod to make it better and I had a really good time with it recompiled is that out yet it's called vanilla but better it's not a the recomps not done yet no see my like I'm just waiting for a lot of recomps because I played the recon for um
[74:20.72]Majora's was just amazing.
[74:22.64]Yeah, it's great.
[74:24.00]Yeah, and Perfect dark is another of my favorite n64 games that got a really good recap Wait, there's a perfect dark recap.
[74:32.10]There is he thought about that and Goldeneye Yeah, I'll try to go.
[74:36.41]I I missed out on the perfect dark when I was younger, you know, I know oh No, wait, oh we're dead, right we did Just gonna run away very quickly I
[74:50.04]wow what the fuck was all that oh my god we are dead did we just all cart uh me and poke didn't they hit you with the you haven't seen this before ability you need to pull down the rocks and take cover behind them oh wait somebody said somebody chat saying you could get banned for harvester now
[75:18.74]Really?
[75:19.20]What?
[75:20.48]Did I read that right?
[75:23.37]Do you guys remember that game on Steam?
[75:24.97]House Party?
[75:25.57]When it came out?
[75:27.23]Yeah, I do.
[75:27.81]Did you stream it?
[75:29.11]I don't remember if I did.
[75:30.11]I streamed it when it came out.
[75:32.05]It was just insane.
[75:34.65]You thought you... Yeah, people saying... I was saying I was going to get banned for it, probably.
[75:43.10]Oh, shit.
[75:44.82]Yeah, that game is fucked up.
[75:46.34]Hey, you know what?
[75:46.80]Never mind.
[75:47.12]I'm pulling that recommendation back.
[75:50.30]I mean, people are playing Fear and Hunger.
[75:51.58]Apparently, that's just as fucked up, right?
[75:53.82]True.
[75:55.95]Yeah, it's wicked fucked up.
[76:06.78]um there's a game where you play as a cockroach it's called bad mojo from the 90s it is an FMV cockroach game and it is like Joe's apartment the game if you know what that is but it's it's very weird and when you're looking for like crusty like FMV games that's a good one okay I'll look at it I'll look that one up too yeah just stuff like that it's good
[76:43.49]Hitting his hand.
[76:44.03]I'm hitting his hand.
[76:44.67]It's working.
[76:49.34]Perfect block, dude.
[76:50.48]Perfect block.
[77:15.72]I think my guy is cold.
[77:17.12]I forgot we could drink a hot drink.
[77:20.88]Yeah.
[77:21.62]Make a hot drink.
[77:22.92]Shit.
[77:23.38]I don't think I have one.
[77:24.70]Shit.
[77:25.10]Yeah, I ain't got one.
[77:30.22]I don't think.
[77:31.32]Uh-oh.
[77:31.82]Man, that tracer round doesn't last very long, does it?
[77:35.92]Oops, out of heals.
[77:42.29]I marked him.
[77:43.03]Maybe you guys can't see him.
[77:50.73]The focus of his head is too hard.
[77:52.21]I think I'm real cold.
[77:53.66]Die.
[77:55.64]Can't you just loot items on the map?
[78:00.34]Here, like a heat thing.
[78:01.90]Wait.
[78:02.38]I don't think there are any here.
[78:07.83]There's none.
[78:19.38]is he laying down oh oh man the dragon pierces go like through that whole thing with so much damage
[78:49.96]We got them.
[78:50.48]Now you can attack it back directly.
[78:56.95]Here's my move.
[78:57.67]Oh, no.
[78:59.77]What?
[78:59.99]I want us to attack the back.
[79:06.94]OK, I'm nice.
[79:18.02]yeah oh man oops no portable I'm just like very slowly learning the gameplay loop of the bow it's cool
[79:46.96]Okay.
[79:47.60]Oh, do we have to?
[79:48.90]Yeah.
[79:49.48]Wait, what do we do?
[79:50.06]You got to get behind.
[79:51.00]You got to get where Olivia is.
[79:51.92]Fucking God.
[79:53.96]Where's Olivia?
[79:54.50]Oh.
[79:59.64]It still hit me.
[80:00.54]You saw that?
[80:01.40]What the hell?
[80:02.81]I was right next to you.
[80:08.09]Nice.
[80:09.45]Nice.
[80:11.29]That was great.
[80:12.77]Really cool monster.
[80:13.67]That was fun.
[80:18.95]Don't focus on nudity in a game.
[80:22.03]Yeah, there was some nudity in the Dracula game.
[80:23.87]We just kind of hand-waved it away.
[80:26.65]Just close your eyes.
[80:30.29]As long as it's artistic.
[80:33.99]Apparently Twitch is cool with artistic nudity.
[80:35.87]Yeah, I think the rule is if it's part of the game and you don't focus on it and... Yeah, like really artistic, like Conan Exiles...
[80:45.70]it's not in the middle of the screen the whole time like any game like that there was like a lot of floppy dong and conan exiles like it was distracting it was too much you guys ever play age of conan the MMO I'm saying the box at the game stop
[81:15.62]I saw you, Hope, open Ragnarok Online for two seconds the other day.
[81:20.25]It was a random private server I didn't really trust.
[81:24.85]The dream died.
[81:26.33]The dream died.
[81:27.43]What can I say?
[81:32.72]The starting area was weird.
[81:35.29]That was enough.
[81:37.61]They all are different.
[81:39.11]Exactly.
[81:39.69]It just wasn't what I was used to.
[81:41.73]Damn.
[81:42.89]Vibes off.
[81:43.65]You played Ragnarok?
[81:45.01]I played a ton of custom servers, and yeah.
[81:47.41]Oh, I love that game.
[81:48.35]So good.
[81:50.29]Yep.
[81:52.19]I love Ragnarok so much, I played Tree of Savior.
[81:55.94]Oh... Yeah, I didn't do that.
[81:57.38]But if people... Dude, I would play again, you know, if it came back.
[82:00.74]It had a small comeback a while ago because they had sort of their own, like, classic server comeback.
[82:07.74]I played a little bit and it kind of fell off again.
[82:11.05]Shit.
[82:12.97]Um, did you ever play MapleStory?
[82:15.79]Yeah.
[82:17.63]And then MapleStory 2 that, like, immediately people just kind of gave up on.
[82:22.79]You hear about that, uh...
[82:24.72]called maple three worlds they made like a big one in uh I think Korea or where it's like a it's like roblox where you can make your own type of game in it and people just recreated the original maple story and it's huge it's huge in that game it's like millions of players damn yeah yeah I never got into any of those that was a was that a browser-based MMO I didn't really play very many of those which is the 2d
[82:53.40]it was just like a 2d it's a side scroller MMO and it was very grindy it put me off almost immediately but the first MMO I played was shadowbane I think and that was like a proto wow and it had like you know supposedly build your own towns and this is like early 2000s they attempted this but uh I fell off very quickly
[83:18.73]WoW kind of just stomped out every other MMO in my book.
[83:22.83]Never heard of Shadowbane.
[83:25.53]Oh, really?
[83:25.93]I heard that you were contemplating maybe doing some WoW classic hardcore, or you said it was probably the number one thing that you would want to do?
[83:34.87]Absolutely not.
[83:36.51]Are you still playing, Jerma?
[83:37.47]What level are you?
[83:38.71]Like level 20.
[83:41.01]I can make you bags if you need anything.
[83:42.68]I got my mage still.
[83:44.20]Yeah, me and Etalyx are going through it.
[83:47.06]He's in it too.
[83:51.67]I'm just playing it casually, though.
[83:52.85]I'm not trying to grind or anything.
[83:56.35]The only thing I would do is, like I said, I played up until Burning Crusade.
[84:00.09]I would go revisit my character, run around the world a little bit, have some nostalgia, and then I think that would be enough for me.
[84:10.64]Chat, am I able to stop the game now and return to this point?
[84:15.78]Yeah, right?
[84:16.24]I mean, of course.
[84:17.07]What am I saying?
[84:18.15]Okay, yeah.
[84:19.79]God, I just reverted back to the 90s.
[84:21.55]Alright, I'm going to stop here then.
[84:24.77]Yeah, same.
[84:27.49]Pretty late for me.
[84:28.21]Alright, GG's.
[84:30.25]This was fun.
[84:30.95]Repo was fun.
[84:35.26]Oh, repo is great.
[84:37.36]Apparently, Jerma, we're like three quests away from HR.
[84:41.58]So we're getting there.
[84:43.36]Yeah, I plan on... I'm going to probably play it probably on like Sunday.
[84:46.74]I'm probably just going to be... I know what Talek was saying.
[84:50.35]He was going to try to get to HR, one of the high ranks, so bring in some other boys.
[84:56.85]If you play Sunday, I might be able to play for like an hour or two if I get all my shit done.
[85:01.27]So keep me posted.
[85:03.33]Red alert next week.
[85:05.83]and try.
[85:06.21]Just gotta do some technical stuff, but I'd be down to give it a shot.
[85:09.77]If it doesn't work, then, uh, you guys have VR?
[85:13.73]Yeah.
[85:14.43]I'd be down to do a little bit of, maybe some VR.
[85:17.04]Okay.
[85:18.62]Well, we've got options.
[85:20.24]It's cool.
[85:21.16]I think maybe we get some VR, just get some VR fuckface games, you know what I mean?
[85:25.10]And just go through, like, Oh my god, I don't think I can play those on stream.
[85:29.40]I'm so down.
[85:30.58]Let's go through a list of random multiplayer games.
[85:37.15]Or VRChat.
[85:38.45]Sure.
[85:39.21]Yeah, I'm down.
[85:41.01]That's going to have to be a three-hour stream, I think, for me.
[85:45.15]It's going to eat me alive.
[85:50.37]I've noticed this about VR.
[85:51.54]It doubles my exhaustion.
[85:53.24]I've quantified it.
[85:56.70]So, yeah, that's probably a good strategy.
[86:00.10]I'm definitely down, though.
[86:00.98]I'm into it.
[86:04.61]Lads, it was nice.
[86:06.05]I enjoyed these sessions.
[86:09.45]See you next time, guys.
[86:10.84]Yeah, if any of you guys want to play, I might be playing on Sunday, but if any of you want to, you could probably get to me, you, and Etalyx could probably get to HR, Max, because these boys are already there.
[86:23.52]the people of wyveria yeah yeah I think we can do it so I just Sunday's a kind of a busy day for me but I can I could play for an hour or two so yeah I might not be around on Sunday but we'll see if you're around I definitely want to get to that max rank so if you uh just let me know if you guys are wrong just type in the chat I'll join cool okay alright then see you guys alright see you later guys see you later
[86:55.08]Hmm.
[86:55.58]Okay.
[87:17.55]Well, that's all she wrote for me.
[87:23.70]And I haven't watched a single second of this cutscene.
[87:29.75]On a second playthrough, I'll read it.
[87:32.18]I'll just read the book.
[87:35.04]The book is better anyways, guys.
[87:36.34]Hey, you wanna know something to do?
[87:38.72]Something funny?
[87:39.88]Next time you go to a haunted house with your friends, I'm telling you, you are gonna... Why didn't I tell the other guys this?
[87:45.41]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[87:46.13]This is perfect.
[87:47.97]If you go to a haunted house...
[87:50.11]You want to impress some friends and make them laugh?
[87:53.15]Go through the haunted house.
[87:54.57]Have a big like, oh my God, a huge jump scare happens to you.
[87:58.91]And oh my God, one of your friends are all laughing.
[88:01.24]Turn to your friends and just go, I don't know, man, the book was way better.
[88:06.42]You're going to get some laughs.
[88:08.72]Guaranteed.
[88:15.56]That works every time.
[88:16.55]I've used it a dozen times with a dozen different parties, and I get the same reaction every time.
[88:26.01]Yeah, guaranteed laughs with just this one joke.
[88:31.65]Do I have to pay you royalties for that bit?
[88:34.21]Yeah, so if you do that, and then your friend's laughing and tears are in his eyes, and he hands you a $10 bill, I expect, um, I expect like $1.50 of that.
[88:49.83]But okay, now if somebody pulls that on me, I know where they got it from.
[88:52.92]Exactly.
[89:01.34]They're laughing at you, not with you.
[89:04.39]Now, when people laugh with you, you can tell.
[89:07.13]They all have their fingers all extended and their arms extended, pointing out.
[89:12.01]Like, eight to ten people all pointing out full extension, laughing and pointing.
[89:19.06]And that's how you can tell that they've landed.
[89:20.32]So much beauty.
[89:20.66]Everything is truly, truly beautiful.
[89:38.10]Why do I feel like you already made this joke with other streamers?
[89:40.48]I just told you, I've used it a dozen times.
[89:43.78]It works every time.
[89:45.64]It's a great icebreaker.
[89:53.90]You go to a restaurant that sucks?
[89:56.86]On the ride home from the restaurant?
[89:58.18]You know, that crab rangoon was pretty tough.
[90:03.05]It was awful.
[90:04.63]Yeah, I know what you mean.
[90:06.19]The book was way better.
[90:11.82]Be careful if they're driving the car, by the way.
[90:14.10]If they're the one driving, hold that one back.
[90:16.52]Wait till you park.
[90:35.06]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[90:36.46]That's gonna be it.
[90:40.13]That repo game was really funny.
[90:45.57]That was... It's just perfect little moments to catch on the camera switching around.
[90:55.38]It was great.
[90:56.58]Hope you had a good time.
[90:57.16]Hope it was worth watching.
[90:58.24]Hope you had fun.
[91:00.18]I did.
[91:00.58]That was great.
[91:04.32]Just trying to get to the highest rank so we can do some of that stuff.
[91:11.05]So I will see you all... What is today?
[91:14.01]Is today Thursday?
[91:16.21]I will probably see you guys on Saturday.
[91:17.87]Maybe we'll whip out some other stuff.
[91:23.04]And then Sunday... Maybe we'll get some boys together to do some Monster Hunter.
[91:35.10]And then I'll probably take a couple days after that.
[91:39.40]Like I've been going...
[91:42.05]Pedal onto the ground.
[91:44.62]So.
[91:46.20]Probably take like Monday or Tuesday or so.
[91:48.06]And then maybe come back on Wednesday, Thursday.
[91:55.48]I will see you Saturday.
[91:57.11]Probably around.
[91:58.37]Like.
[92:02.05]One, two, three.
[92:05.91]Between one, two, three.
[92:07.49]I'd say.
[92:08.11]Just keep an eye on the sauce in the next couple days.
[92:12.12]Thanks for watching.
[92:13.44]Thanks, uh... Thanks for this... Whoa, I'm like reading the text that I see.
[92:17.84]Thanks for supporting the stream.
[92:20.96]I gotta get some food.
[92:23.82]But I mean that anyways.
[92:25.06]Thank you for hanging out.
[92:26.16]Thanks for spending time here.
[92:28.24]See you in a couple days.
[92:34.91]Take care.
[92:37.33]Call your mother.
[92:40.13]See you Saturday.
[92:44.47]And bye-bye.
[93:17.41]Thank you.
