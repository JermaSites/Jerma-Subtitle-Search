[04:28.28]And Sam, thanks for the bits.

[04:39.11]Alright, let's go.
[04:39.59]Let's get in.
[04:43.91]Walter, P-Pack, thanks for the three months.
[04:45.23]Nino, Clock, and... I said hi to Kaimo already, but... Hi.
[04:52.48]So, this is going to be one of those things where I'm going to be learning as we go.
[04:57.60]Because I don't know much.
[04:59.14]All I know right now, the last thing I had to do.
[05:02.54]Long sword or riot.
[05:03.54]I want to use the giant goofy katana.
[05:07.41]I got to the base camp.
[05:09.83]And the chief's son was like, oh, cool, thanks, welcome to the base camp.
[05:14.13]You have to give me resources now so we can fix the base camp.
[05:20.36]So, villager requests.
[05:21.94]This is like a quest I have.
[05:22.82]I have to get 30p?
[05:24.60]30 resources or something?
[05:26.30]I think you just get that by killing monsters, right?
[05:29.50]Something like that?
[05:31.28]Wait, what?! !
[05:35.60]Start playing Stardew Valley, thanks to you.
[05:37.02]What have you done to me?
[05:37.94]That's a great game.
[05:43.42]So I think I'm just going to go in the wilderness and just kill things.
[05:46.24]I'm pretty sure that's what I have to do.
[05:50.59]Hey, it's me, the chief's son.
[05:53.85]No, I'm not Junior.
[05:54.91]No one calls me that.
[05:55.65]Anyway, check your map.
[05:56.53]It's expanded.
[05:57.85]It has.
[05:59.80]Which reminds me, I know you're still fresh off the boat, hunter, but I've got a favor to ask.
[06:03.51]I'd like you to gather resources to help us restore the camp to its former glory.
[06:07.13]You know what's rich in resources?
[06:08.41]Carnivores.
[06:08.93]You're a hunter, hunt some.
[06:10.63]As luck would have it, area six on the map is a nest of carnivores ripe for the hunting.
[06:14.68]You should gather some herbs to restore your health.
[06:17.46]I actually have potions already.
[06:19.86]Go get carnivores.
[06:22.68]Mm-hmm.
[06:25.29]Alright, so you guys can't see it, but I can.
[06:27.79]I'm using the Wii U gamepad.
[06:31.35]Does that make me a piece of shit?
[06:35.38]Please tell me if I'm doing this wrong by using the Wii U gamepad.
[06:39.40]And if I am, who gives a shit?
[06:44.86]What am I supposed to do about it?
[06:47.80]Alright, so I can see on the map, but I gotta go to Area 6, which is... It's kind of far away, actually.
[06:51.89]Can I get there?
[06:52.43]Wait, what?! !
[06:55.20]Gamepad cam?
[07:01.87]Max, oh god.
[07:03.59]You're not going to like Dark Souls 2 me, are you?
[07:08.67]Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[07:12.94]You lose max stamina.
[07:17.14]There's no better cure for shrinkage than steak.
[07:22.90]Barbecue spit.
[07:23.56]That's not... Yeah, yeah.
[07:24.64]It's not for tossing salads after you get some raw meat.
[07:26.88]Select the barbecue spit from the item window in the lower right corner of the screen.
[07:30.75]Okay.
[07:32.03]Press the A button once your meat's golden brown.
[07:33.49]Time to... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:34.87]Cook your steak rare or well done and it'll increase your maximum stamina.
[07:38.23]Okay.
[07:39.75]Hold the L button and press the A or Y button to cycle through your items.
[07:43.27]To use selected item, release the L button and press Y. Okay.
[07:48.97]This is the raw meat.
[07:49.89]This is the spit.
[07:50.67]Okay.
[07:54.26]So, just... What do I use it for?
[07:57.48]Why?
[08:01.66]Why is it playing old time piano music?
[08:06.50]Wait, I've burnt it?
[08:12.24]Why did I burn it?
[08:13.30]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[08:17.00]Let me play the fucking piano again.
[08:22.55]That wasn't even fucking cooked.
[08:23.72]It was still pink.
[08:24.80]Alright, done.
[08:25.60]Right?
[08:26.62]Rare steak.
[08:27.38]That's what I like.
[08:27.92]Okay, now do I have, like, is it here?
[08:32.32]Burnt meat.
[08:34.14]Rare steak.
[08:40.03]I hate that steak like a corn on the cob.
[08:42.43]Holy shit, that's a lot of back stamina.
[08:45.95]You see how bad I am at cooking?
[08:47.63]It's either burnt or raw.
[08:49.71]Okay.
[08:52.19]Alright, let's go.
[08:53.15]Let's go kill some fucking monsters.
[08:55.87]Thank you, Gray2j, DLGendRider, TheLegendRider, HawkBitsSlayer1, AlamoBin, SlamButtSky, and ElioButt, thank you guys.
[09:06.63]Oh, and Sly161!
[09:08.07]Thanks a lot!
[09:09.27]And ZachTheSloth!
[09:10.05]Thanks, man!
[09:12.25]Alright, so let me look at the map.
[09:13.23]I guess I gotta go to 6.
[09:14.67]How do I get to 6?
[09:17.37]This way, I think?
[09:18.69]Yeah, this way.
[09:23.71]Well done, steak.
[09:24.51]It's good.
[09:27.93]I barely even know how to fight things.
[09:30.89]The monster list.
[09:33.99]Hunter's notes, okay.
[09:36.45]You can increase your monster list categories by buying monster info in the market.
[09:46.18]Hunter notes.
[09:47.58]Monster list.
[09:51.02]No data.
[09:53.24]I don't know shit, apparently.
[09:54.28]Okay.
[09:55.78]So now I gotta go... This is gonna take me to Area 7 if I go up this way, but... Am I gonna beat Monster Hunter 3?
[10:02.89]I don't... I don't know.
[10:03.61]I'm just kind of playing it to see if I like it.
[10:05.85]A lot of people told me to play this.
[10:07.37]They were saying... Monsters!
[10:09.27]Hold on a second.
[10:09.91]Monsters!
[10:16.60]No, take it out!
[10:17.96]There we go.
[10:19.46]Hold on a second, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:20.60]Monsters!
[10:21.44]Monsters!
[10:28.97]Alright, wait.
[10:29.41]How do I play?
[10:30.65]How do I play this game?
[10:32.01]It's A, right?
[10:32.71]Come here!
[10:36.91]Come here, you monster!
[10:39.73]What?
[10:42.09]Oh, nice attack.
[10:43.59]Maybe you're not such a fresh-off-the-boat hunter after all.
[10:47.05]You can check the resources you've collected from killing monsters once you get back into the MOGA village.
[10:51.96]After I finish blabbering, look at the lower left corner of the screen.
[10:54.74]Once you have 30 resource points, we'll be good to go.
[10:56.48]Happy hunting.
[10:59.28]Alright, that was two resource points.
[11:02.48]How do I put the... Was it Y to put it back?
[11:04.28]How do I put the sword back?
[11:05.14]I think it's Y. Yeah.
[11:07.33]And then you can, like, chop him up and eat him, right?
[11:11.55]Warm pelt.
[11:16.99]Huh?
[11:20.05]I stole his skin and he came back to life.
[11:23.30]Okay.
[11:26.80]Come here, you monster!
[11:28.97]Is there a lock-on in this game?
[11:30.07]I don't think there is.
[11:31.34]Am I supposed to be doing like A, like A, X, A for combos?
[11:46.23]Is that gonna happen again?
[11:47.07]Yeah.
[11:49.47]Alright, see ya.
[11:51.93]Come back here.
[11:53.91]I'll kill you in the afterlife.
[11:56.60]Wait, what?
[12:00.24]Hey, thank you Mellow Beats and Dr. Moosington and Dragon Pie or Dragon Nipple.
[12:06.91]Alright, Area 6 is this way.
[12:08.25]Let's go.
[12:13.37]You could kill them in the Wii version?
[12:17.09]Oh shit, it's a spitter!
[12:19.09]We're in Jurassic Park.
[12:19.97]You guys thought this was Monster Hunter?
[12:21.25]Nope.
[12:25.14]Uh-oh, here come the other spitters!
[12:27.38]They're gonna go... Right here, listen.
[12:36.83]The carvers are called jagi.
[12:39.41]Killing these critters is a great way to collect resources.
[12:42.25]If your health gets low, use an herb to heal pronto.
[12:44.89]And them jagi ain't fond of fire, so use a torch to get them away.
[12:48.57]I don't have a torch.
[12:51.41]Focus too much on attacking and you might never come back.
[12:53.52]Remember, you have evasive moves too.
[12:56.32]Okay.
[12:57.86]That's a seal?
[13:05.18]What are my evasive moves?
[13:06.52]Okay, left stick and B is like a dodge, I'm assuming.
[13:11.59]Wait, what?
[13:12.59]There's a maneuver to cancel out of the attack, okay.
[13:17.82]You can also evade vertically underwater while attacking.
[13:20.45]Vertical evasion with the left stick using orientation type 2 depends on which way your character is facing.
[13:25.87]Alright, so... It really is just Dark Souls.
[13:29.95]How do you lock on?
[13:31.43]Can you lock on?
[13:32.13]Alright, let's get these fucking spitters.
[13:38.85]That's not what I want to do.
[13:42.15]Let's take them all one by one.
[13:43.09]I don't think there is a lock on.
[13:48.89]Oh, see you later, Yaggy.
[13:55.19]Dark Souls.
[13:59.13]Alright, I get it.
[14:00.33]I get it.
[14:00.63]I'm sorry.
[14:15.26]That was great.
[14:21.73]Ooh, nice hit.
[14:25.53]Any more?
[14:25.83]Let's get some meat.
[14:32.63]Only lock on to big monsters?
[14:34.03]Okay.
[14:37.21]Wait till I hunt the big game.
[14:40.69]Big game hunter.
[14:47.22]Whoa, excuse me.
[14:50.46]Oh, god damn it.
[14:52.22]Oh, I need to unbind that.
[14:54.06]That's gonna be obnoxious.
[14:55.68]I think, like, I'm so used to Y being attack.
[15:00.20]X is not attack ever in a video game for me.
[15:06.41]Like, the top button on the controller is attack.
[15:09.33]It's always Y. In every video game.
[15:12.91]Why would they make that X?
[15:15.57]Are you fucking crazy?
[15:26.77]Can I change the... Hold on.
[15:30.11]Can I get to the options?
[15:32.35]I have to change that.
[15:33.17]It's going to drive me fucking crazy.
[15:35.74]Maybe I can't.
[15:39.76]Maybe I can't right now.
[15:45.33]Next?
[15:46.63]Next?
[15:46.97]What do you mean next?
[15:48.21]God damn it!
[15:57.36]This is gonna take so much getting used to.
[16:16.31]He's like, why?
[16:17.50]Alright, hold on.
[16:18.46]First of all, first of all, let me explain something.
[16:19.98]Let me explain why this is fucking stupid.
[16:21.98]Okay?
[16:23.48]Why puts the sword away, but why doesn't take the sword out?
[16:29.76]Why puts the fucking sword back, but not... Why?
[16:32.68]That's like, what?
[16:38.77]Oh, I'm done.
[16:39.21]Let me put my sword away with Y. Oh, now if I press Y again, could I take... No!
[16:43.83]Sharpen your fucking blade!
[16:54.72]Shut up and watch the stream, you diaper babies.
[17:00.76]How many resources do I have?
[17:01.62]Let me see the list.
[17:08.79]Quest info.
[17:12.11]30 resources.
[17:14.39]Can I see how many I have?
[17:17.02]Garbage?
[17:17.78]Why do I have garbage?
[17:21.96]Oh, there's 39.
[17:22.44]I got enough.
[17:26.93]So I can just go back.
[17:28.57]Is it faster if I go this way?
[17:31.41]No, I'm just going to have to run.
[17:34.57]Wait, there's another jaggy.
[17:35.37]These guys kind of just don't even move.
[17:43.24]Alright, let me just be done here.
[17:53.54]Hey, thank you, coffee, for the four months.
[17:55.48]Hollow shards, thanks for the new sub.
[17:58.37]Thank you, Jobby Smith, for two months.
[18:00.88]A.K.O.
[18:01.28]Shawn Michael.
[18:02.56]Missed Muppet.
[18:03.92]Thanks a lot, guys.
[18:06.06]Let's go back to town.
[18:07.14]Can I, like, salvage something in here?
[18:08.60]No.
[18:08.82]Let's go.
[18:10.70]Time to go.
[18:14.22]XXA is a good combo.
[18:15.24]You can repeat it.
[18:17.47]I'm going to try.
[18:18.23]Let's see.
[18:19.17]What?
[18:21.91]That's good.
[18:22.61]Cool.
[18:23.17]Can you do, like, AXX?
[18:25.09]Yep.
[18:26.03]What about AXA?
[18:30.97]Not quite.
[18:31.37]Oh, whatever.
[18:33.61]I gotta pick up herbs, too.
[18:37.89]Is this an herb?
[18:38.77]It is.
[18:39.19]What is it?
[18:42.31]Say, it looks like you found some herbs.
[18:43.57]You can gather items like herbs multiple times, you know.
[18:45.81]Aside from herbs, you'll find all sorts of good.
[18:47.94]Nice World of Warcraft ripoff.
[18:51.94]Yeah.
[18:53.02]Peeking your item pouch from the game, you need to get an idea of what the items you found are good for.
[18:55.82]Alright, once you're ready, it's time to hunt some carnivores.
[18:58.81]Remember, Area 6 on the map is crawling with meat eaters.
[19:03.21]Yeah, I know.
[19:05.93]Mm-hmm.
[19:06.73]Wait, what?
[19:08.63]I guess I can pick them up.
[19:11.55]Hey, Zero, thanks for the sub.
[19:12.83]And, uh, Toop.
[19:14.09]Thank you, Toop, for the resub.
[19:16.37]There's a lot on here.
[19:19.29]Ooh.
[19:19.41]Ooh.
[19:23.38]How many times can I do this?
[19:24.38]I can do this like a million times?
[19:33.97]Okay, that was a lot.
[19:41.03]Herb.
[19:44.65]Okay.
[19:46.83]We can restore health.
[19:52.20]Whatever, let's go.
[19:58.79]And thank you, Zev.
[20:01.93]Appreciate it, dude.
[20:03.41]Uh, what do I need to go down?
[20:04.65]Thanks for the sub.
[20:05.81]Um, your favorite internet personality?
[20:06.99]Well, that's very kind of you, dude.
[20:08.02]Thanks a lot.
[20:13.66]Combine herbs and blue potions.
[20:15.12]Yeah, you guys are going to have to help me out a little bit here, because I, um... It's not that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but, you know, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[20:26.53]Yeah, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[20:40.26]Oh, hold on, my mic is muted.
[20:42.80]Wait, wait, you were sleeping?
[20:45.14]Oh, you were asleep.
[20:47.42]Oh, hold on.
[20:47.76]Don't be in a rush.
[20:48.36]You feel free to come and go through the village.
[20:52.85]When you go back to the village, it makes you... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:54.97]Hunting report.
[20:55.53]Hunting report.
[20:55.97]I'm sure that the resources you got... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:58.37]Don't forget, report back after you... Yeah.
[21:00.97]This is all shit I don't need to care about.
[21:03.43]Oh, a dog got in here.
[21:04.15]No.

[39:41.72]She was like, what the fuck are you doing?
[39:45.24]Jeremy got nowhere quick.
[39:47.76]He was walking around in circles like I typically fucking do on these streams.
[39:51.67]Just like you do around your fucking apartment.
[39:53.35]You're just slumping around, dude.
[39:56.67]Wait, what?
[39:56.97]What's wrong with schlepping around?
[39:58.41]Dude, it's okay.

[40:21.72]Like, this is just, like, for some reason, this is just fun to do.
[40:24.24]I like walking around and picking up stuff.
[40:26.70]I just have you know, somebody just, uh, gave you a hundred bits or something like that.
[40:30.53]What?

[42:16.36]So I got to bring that ore back to town.
[42:19.91]Jeremy's dead.
[42:20.73]No, I'm alive.
[42:22.41]By the way, something that I noticed.
[42:24.67]The stream's still on.
[42:28.01]I called up the fucking Comcast guy, and I'm just like, hey, Comcast guy, like, fuck you.
[42:32.42]In layman's terms, right?
[42:33.26]Okay, combine materials.
[42:34.12]Go to the blacksmith.
[42:35.46]Alright, so, should I make, do I have, can I make the longsword?
[42:37.70]Maybe I should just do that.
[43:01.63]Oh God, she's back from the dead.
[43:03.85]Dude, I'm like literally dead.
[43:06.11]Just fucking bury me already.
[43:10.85]I get it.
[43:12.55]I get it.
[43:15.79]So you sent the next scheduled stream starting in an hour.
[43:20.61]One hour.
[43:20.91]This guy?
[43:21.99]Yeah.
[43:22.65]I put on a different armor.
[43:31.56]Should I make the longsword?
[43:37.81]Can I?
[43:38.13]Let's see.
[43:41.35]No, I have... That sword is longer than your entire body.
[43:46.20]Yeah, I don't know why I would need anything else.
[43:49.71]Let me see.
[43:50.71]Today's going great.
[43:52.13]Don't ruin my mood.
[43:53.11]He wants more fun.
[43:54.37]I about slipped a disco.
[43:55.73]This aura runs back in the day.
[43:56.87]Eat these tips from Junio.
[43:58.80]I mean me.
[43:59.40]First, always bring a pickaxe.
[44:00.50]Yeah, I have one.
[44:01.38]You can't mine already.
[44:02.14]Bare hands in caves and rocky areas.
[44:03.86]Study your surroundings.
[44:05.58]Look closely and you'll notice the odd patches.
[44:07.94]Just like World of Warcraft.
[44:09.12]Just like WoW.
[44:11.40]Have you ever played RuneScape?
[44:13.33]I actually have never played RuneScape in my whole life.
[44:19.01]Dude, I played RuneScape for like five minutes.
[44:22.27]Alright.
[44:24.57]So you opened the menu and made a character and then you hit the X in the corner.
[44:28.05]How do I feel about dating such a poor guy?
[44:30.11]Thank you for the 400 bits.
[44:31.69]Oh, thanks for the bits, dude.
[44:32.64]Wait, dating such a... Wait, what did it say?
[44:36.60]I think Kim swears more than Jerma.
[44:39.60]This is astounding.
[44:41.36]You want to have a swear contest?
[44:42.62]No, let's not have a swear.
[44:43.46]I actually don't swear that much, I don't think.
[44:46.46]It's just a thing with being around here.
[44:48.74]Trimming armor.
[44:49.72]Yeah, it looks good.
[44:50.16]Let's see how those woods look.
[44:52.64]Alright.
[44:53.34]Let me see.
[44:55.46]Hunt report.
[44:57.88]Are these the things that you kill?
[44:59.62]Yeah.
[45:02.65]Broodscape is for casuals.
[45:04.25]I've never played it.
[45:06.79]Fish finder shroom Jerma.
[45:08.97]Shroom Jerma.
[45:12.75]Stay sharp, it's cruel world.
[45:13.77]Alright, um... Let me look at my little mini-map here.
[45:19.27]Don't say stories.
[45:20.29]Okay, I will try not to swear for the rest of the time I'm down in the basement with you.
[45:24.26]Down in the basement.
[45:26.36]Alright, so let me ask a question.
[45:27.98]Let me ask a quick question for people that have played this game.
[45:31.40]What should I be doing?
[45:32.52]What's my next goal?
[45:35.64]How do I get quests?
[45:37.62]Isn't there a person that I can get missions from?
[45:41.54]I swear to God there was somebody I could get missions from.
[45:43.24]Let me save the game first.
[45:47.58]I love the save game, it's amazing.
[45:50.00]You just like throw yourself onto the bed.
[45:52.42]That's how you save a fucking game.
[45:56.26]And then you like burp out acid.
[46:02.14]Time serpent.
[46:04.02]Just talk to people.
[46:04.74]Kill stuff or get friends to kill stuff with you.
[46:09.09]Just keep doing the jobs in quests?
[46:10.19]Okay.
[46:13.04]I think I have enough money to buy better shit.
[46:16.78]I thought you had to make your own tools.
[46:18.42]Like, what is this?
[46:20.06]I mean, you can be lazy like me.
[46:21.54]Just buy things.
[46:23.26]Yeah, catnap in the bed.
[46:24.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:25.65]I don't have any DLC.
[46:27.87]I was catnapping earlier.
[46:29.37]Yeah, you were taking, like, a catnap and you were watching a cat documentary.
[46:33.37]While, like, my cat was, like, lying on your, like, stomach.
[46:36.59]You mean your dog, Otto?
[46:38.38]Yeah, he's pretty much... He was watching TV, too.
[46:40.50]For a little while.
[46:41.16]He, like, he watches TV.
[46:42.26]He's smart.
[46:44.67]Just keep doing what the guys tell you and you'll get proper missions, okay?
[46:50.49]Thanks for the 200 bits.
[46:54.89]Do I get... I don't get 10,000 bits donations every time I stream.
[47:00.88]What does this person have to say?
[47:03.60]It's amazing when it happens and I never am, like, asking for it.
[47:06.88]You guys are fucking spoiling me sometimes, though.
[47:11.94]I'm gonna go, let's just go look around.
[47:13.58]I'm just gonna, you know what, I'm just gonna look around.
[47:15.08]I'm gonna go to an area I haven't been to and just start fucking smashing people.
[47:17.53]I think that's what I'm gonna do.
[47:23.23]Um... Do these last?
[47:26.71]Do I need to buy these, or do they last a lot?
[47:28.21]I would say just, like, buy the better quality one.
[47:30.55]Just like how I buy, like, better quality everything, and then you, like, are astonished by the price tag.
[47:35.55]Yeah, you fucking spend, you spend money.
[47:38.27]Well, I'm a bougie bitch.
[47:40.09]Pfft.
[47:43.98]Raindrop.
[47:46.14]What the fuck are you doing?
[47:50.40]I'm dancing.
[47:53.48]Jarrah scams his subs?
[47:56.70]I'm only 20% convinced that this isn't a prank.
[47:59.96]Maybe it is a prank.
[48:01.22]It's not a prank.
[48:01.90]We did the joke yesterday, right?
[48:05.16]Yesterday we did that?
[48:06.52]Yeah, we did the prank yesterday.
[48:07.62]I'm just going to buy one of these.
[48:08.48]Who cares?
[48:09.14]I'll buy the better one.
[48:16.73]I don't like that music.
[48:17.67]I don't like that music.
[48:19.65]It's not nice.
[48:20.81]You need to listen to like fucking church music.
[48:24.61]Where's the church music with the organs?
[48:26.17]Dude, we still have the fucking clown makeup down here.
[48:28.61]Where's the church music with the organs?
[48:29.95]Dude, sometimes I feel like I need to go to church because of the fucking way I be acting sometimes.
[48:40.38]Should I just go fucking kill shit?
[48:43.50]I'm just gonna go kill stuff.

[48:52.44]We're gonna be polar opposites in this stream.
[48:54.28]Don't listen to me.
[48:55.28]You stay in school, drink your fucking milk, and take your multivitamins.
[48:58.61]You understand?
[48:59.07]Listen, milk is actually really fucking bad for you.

[52:47.83]This is a giant mushroom.
[52:51.09]You can pour it back to camp with a menu.
[52:52.59]Can you actually do that?
[52:54.74]What?
[52:58.60]How the fuck do I do that?
[53:00.18]Kim, ask him about the movies he made in the movies.
[53:03.76]Don't let him weasel out of it either.
[53:06.58]Thank you for the 300 bits.

[53:40.15]I just gotta go back to the village.
[53:41.41]Okay.
[53:41.80]Well, let's go this way.
[53:42.62]I am not streaming on Jerma's thing.
[53:45.92]But I have streamed on my own before.
[53:48.32]My own Twitch channel.
[53:50.64]And I literally streamed for all of like five minutes before I started freaking out.
[53:54.61]And I was like, fuck that shit.
[54:00.00]Maybe, maybe you'll play, like, Left 4 Dead or something.
[54:01.88]No, you should, like, stream, like, VR or something like that.

[54:14.77]I'm getting weaseled.
[54:16.66]I didn't get weaseled.
[54:17.86]I was just fucking threw up.
[54:21.14]I gotta talk to some artisan guy in the village.
[54:23.82]Thank you for the 500 bits of skis, because I don't know how to pronounce that.
[54:27.44]Skits or something.

[56:14.72]It is fun.
[56:15.98]I just, like, my brain can't focus.
[56:18.93]Wait, so what about the sleeve of Oreos?
[56:22.37]You just told the whole story.
[56:24.20]You basically ate a whole entire sleeve of Oreos if you turned your mom's back.
[56:27.20]I was sick, and I ate an entire sleeve of Oreos, and I threw up directly into my mother's bed.
[56:31.94]And we, like, flipped the mattress.
[56:35.58]Oh, my God.
[56:37.06]No, we cleaned it.
[56:37.66]It wasn't that big of a deal.
[56:39.44]Dude, the fact that you can eat a whole entire... Guild, sweetheart.
[56:43.62]Girl, the desk next to your house.
[56:45.06]Okay.
[56:45.94]Thank you for that.

[57:19.37]Down by, like, the farm, maybe?
[57:20.49]I had a quest to give somebody that ore.
[57:27.72]Little Hammer Man needs the ore.
[57:29.56]Okay.
[57:30.00]Yeah, there we go.
[57:33.26]Give me that iron ore.
[57:36.58]You have to use pickaxe to mine it.

[57:41.73]Okay, so everybody has, like, a little list.
[57:43.61]I get it.
[57:44.65]I got you.
[57:45.49]Okay.
[57:46.07]Got it.
[57:49.35]We're here for Kim.
[57:50.35]It happened 10 years ago when Jermo was 30.
[57:55.34]You're 31.
[57:57.62]Jermo was just a little boy at 30.
[58:00.90]Just a little baby boy.
[58:02.32]Danny DeVito.
[58:04.76]Don't leave a cup in my hoodie.
[58:06.21]It really upsets me.
[58:08.79]I don't get it.
[58:09.86]Yeah, you're not gonna get, like, a lot of the random things that these people are gonna say.
[58:14.66]Because they're bringing, like, inside jokes from, like, fucking five years ago.
[58:18.34]Thank you for the 100 bits, though.
[58:21.46]Left 4 Dead with Jerma Kim Stern tag.
[58:25.06]Who's tag?
[58:26.32]I haven't heard of him.
[58:28.02]He's another streamer and, like, content creator guy.
[58:31.41]TF2.
[58:33.19]Team Fortress.
[58:34.75]Oh, by the way!
[58:35.47]I wanted to mention this because...
[58:40.44]Okay, now that that opened this up, I think.
[58:44.49]Chief is looking for you.
[58:45.55]Go see what's up.
[58:47.83]He's sitting right here.
[58:48.81]Hold on, give me a minute.
[58:49.81]I need to get on track for a second here, guys.
[58:51.55]Sorry.
[58:53.69]That's not the person I wanted to talk to.
[58:54.77]Oh my god, please.
[58:59.83]Can you move the arrow over here?
[59:03.75]Can you... I want to talk to this guy!
[59:06.77]Okay.
[59:07.37]Okay.
[59:09.12]With all the pieces out there, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:11.55]So you get to sign proof that you're cut above the average hunter.
[59:13.63]You've got exceptional judgment.
[59:14.63]After all, why go out there and risk your neck and bring... I've got a good feeling about you, son.
[59:19.55]Anyway, we'll have to base camp up and running before you can say, Jumpin' Jaggy!
[59:23.85]Hang tight and what?
[59:24.75]You'll get bored if you have to wait around for the repairs.
[59:28.91]I read that so literally.
[59:31.28]You're more tenacious than a Kelby in heat.
[59:33.00]Alright, I got an idea.
[59:38.84]You're gonna take a sea monster on.
[59:40.14]You've literally got to get your feet wet.
[59:42.28]Go through the mogu woods till you hit the shore.
[59:44.12]Dive in and try hunting some fish.
[59:47.60]Okay.
[59:48.20]Okay.
[59:55.13]Okay.
[59:56.75]Mogeshore.
[59:57.49]Is it this way?
[60:00.53]Have I seen the Jeremiah Rumble live action?
[60:02.63]I have not.
[60:03.76]She has not.
[60:07.84]That is something that she has not seen.
[60:10.88]A sea monster.
[60:13.52]Let's see the artisan.
[60:15.25]Am I going to be in the next Jeremiah Rumble?
[60:18.31]I don't believe it.
[60:19.07]I'm a very non-violent person.
[60:21.60]Yeah, but you gotta come in and give, like, somebody, you gotta give, like, a clothesline to somebody.
[60:25.27]Do you want me to wear my cheerleader outfit?
[60:27.85]And then do, like, a sprint and do, fucking, like, a lariat to me, and I'll go over the top ropes, and I'll do, like, the fucking hands in the air, like, can't believe it.
[60:36.55]Am I dating him for his internet fame?
[60:38.53]He's not famous!
[60:39.47]Let's just get that he's just, like, a regular dude.
[60:45.58]You hear that guys?
[60:45.98]I'm just a regular fucking guy, just like you!
[60:48.54]Just like you, I never was any different, right?
[61:04.07]I love how this went from a Monster Hunter stream to like a Jerma gets roasted.
[61:11.16]That's funny.
[61:13.30]Alright, umm... Head farmers looking for you.
[61:16.24]A lot of people are always looking for me.
[61:17.32]I just want to go kill monsters.

[62:33.26]Alright, let's go.
[62:33.80]I mean, how do I finish?
[62:36.46]Oh, I'm stupid.
[62:39.15]Who do I need to talk to?
[62:40.01]Nintendo fangirl.
[62:46.13]You could be a Nintendo fan, girl Nintendo fanboy.
[62:49.04]Oh, I would kick his ass in Super Smash Brothers.

[63:28.64]No, I could just go get it.
[63:31.10]Smash ro- Actually, no, I couldn't.
[63:32.42]Never mind.
[63:33.36]Wait, what?
[63:36.58]Break her switch when she buys it.
[63:38.36]Dude, if he did that, I would break all of his fucking fingers and then run over him with his car.
[63:54.42]If I break your switch, you're gonna run me over with a car.
[63:57.12]Your car.
[63:58.62]I could, like, find the keys.
[64:00.82]I have, like, ten different sets of keys hidden in the house.
[64:03.89]How are you gonna know where the real one is?
[64:06.77]Only I know.
[64:07.93]Only I know where the real one is.

[64:47.76]I just think that the chat is so funny.
[64:49.88]Yeah, I've been just all of it paying attention to is just our, like, this whole conversation.
[64:55.06]Well, we had a really good conversation before you even started playing.
[64:57.94]Like, you couldn't even focus on this game earlier because, like, we were talking about, like...
[65:02.94]Um, stuff that I won't say on stream.
[65:04.36]Yeah, yeah.
[65:05.18]I don't want to, like, open that can.
[65:06.68]Don't open that can.
[65:07.98]We don't do cans of worms.
[65:09.11]You don't want to open cans of worms.
[65:10.13]You don't know what they taste like.
[65:11.03]They might be fucking rotten.
[65:13.69]I'm sure you know what they taste like.
[65:15.69]You think I know what worms taste like?
[65:17.03]Because you eat vermin, yeah.
[65:19.47]Like fucking poultry, dude.
[65:20.78]Disgusting.
[65:22.86]Why is it gross?
[65:23.91]Dude, chicken is so fucking weird.
[65:26.73]And so is turkey.
[65:27.73]Turkey is also- Turkey.
[65:29.15]Turkey is fantastic.
[65:31.47]You and those fucking turkey burgers.
[65:33.85]I swear.
[65:35.83]Oh, no.
[65:36.05]Now you opened up the chicken can of worms.
[65:39.84]So what do I do?
[65:40.60]I can combine these things?
[65:43.58]Blue mushroom and shroom Jerm?
[65:45.34]What does that do?
[65:46.04]Cycles?
[65:48.18]Let's do two cycles.
[65:51.37]Shroom, Jerm, and blue mushrooms.
[65:52.35]So I can like grow my own shit?
[65:53.27]That's cool.
[65:56.03]Should I do two cycles?
[65:56.88]Three cycles?
[66:02.66]Turkey burgers.
[66:03.46]What's fucking wrong with turkey burgers?
[66:07.58]Why does everybody keep typing like coffee, Cheetos, and can of chicken?
[66:11.99]Or chicken.
[66:13.27]It's something.
[66:14.59]It's just one of those jokes.
[66:19.11]Can of chicken worms.
[66:22.88]So how long does this take?
[66:26.73]No new requests.
[66:28.81]What?
[66:29.69]Remember that can of worms you were talking about?
[66:38.23]He said it.
[66:38.77]He said it.
[66:39.23]I did.
[66:39.55]I said it.
[66:43.59]Um, what does this person do?
[66:45.51]Veggies, veggies, veggies.
[66:46.33]There's more than... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[66:47.53]During the health boom a while back, a lot of us felines decided to go organic.
[66:52.07]Yeah, that's why our vegetables might not be the prettiest, but they're definitely the most tasty.
[66:55.39]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[66:58.89]Sushi fish added.
[66:59.81]This is the best.
[67:03.85]Not even sub mode can save, chat.
[67:07.11]Wanna try giving me a new meme?
[67:09.65]Tater.
[67:12.67]Okay, bye.
[67:15.31]So now I can... I guess that takes, like, a couple days?
[67:20.45]Some of your subbies saw my face yesterday.
[67:26.11]Some of your subbies saw my face yesterday.
[67:28.15]Don't call them subbies.
[67:29.31]Call them, like, substantials.
[67:32.25]Subbies?
[67:32.79]Substantials.
[67:33.55]Subbies.
[67:35.79]They're substantials.
[67:36.99]Subbies.
[67:37.79]Because, like, subbies has two Bs in it.
[67:40.49]And I call you BBs.
[67:44.33]This is embarrassing on stream.
[67:46.49]Oh, I'm like here to roast the fuck out of you.
[67:50.17]I know.
[67:51.67]Yeah.
[67:54.57]She's like fucking so happy to be down here and just fuck with me right now.
[68:00.69]On stream.
[68:04.99]She is having so much fun just fucking trying to get my face to turn bright goddamn red.
[68:10.52]It is.
[68:13.24]It's just, ah, tomatoes.
[68:16.94]Where do I go?
[68:22.68]This is all deliberate, by the way.
[68:25.12]Deliberate.
[68:28.38]Oh, boy.
[68:32.71]Let me save the game.
[68:35.93]Stream ruined.
[68:39.29]Should I put, should we want to put the, I don't, the face cam's not even plugged in.
[68:44.67]What does he do?
[68:45.11]He actually might need to go out.
[68:48.02]Oh, do you want me to take him out?
[68:49.46]Just take him to go pee if you would.
[68:51.36]If you could, please.
[68:53.62]Otto, you want to go for it?
[68:54.88]I walk.
[69:08.67]Wait, what?
[69:17.44]Okay.
[69:20.18]Let's go fight a monster.
[69:20.92]I gotta go fish shit.
[69:24.17]This is now a sun stream?
[69:25.15]Alright.
[69:27.37]So after that... After that, now let's blink twice if I need help.
[69:35.81]Talk to this person.
[69:40.06]Yeah, she likes to come on here and... And, like, fuck with me.
[69:43.69]To, like, make it, um... To make me, like, wince.
[69:47.91]She gets lots of... Pleasure out of doing that.
[69:51.99]Apparently.
[70:00.05]Sorry, I haven't been able to pay very much attention.
[70:01.72]I've been... Insult her while she's gone.
[70:06.08]No.
[70:10.25]What happens if I go here?
[70:11.31]This is multiplayer, but what is this?
[70:14.39]Just another area?
[70:17.96]I would assume something like that.
[70:25.36]Give me one second.
[70:26.08]My dog's being a freak show.
[70:27.32]Hold on.
[70:27.70]One second.
[70:28.10]Tea break.
[70:28.40]I'll be right back.
[70:48.68]Yeah.
[72:08.99]Hi.
[72:14.95]Okay.
[72:18.34]Oh, that's the wrong thing.
[72:19.44]There it is.
[72:25.33]Mute the mic.
[72:25.79]The mic was muted.
[72:31.15]Alright, let me go... I just got so distracted.
[72:35.46]I think I need to talk to this... Can I talk to this lady again?
[72:38.12]Does she have a quest for me now?
[72:44.66]Yeah.
[72:46.80]Hunt for beans, make a good cheerleader.
[72:48.42]What were we talking about?
[72:49.42]By the way, the chief was looking for you.
[72:52.11]No, I guess this just leads into the next part.
[72:56.17]I guess this just leads into the next thing.
[73:00.39]That's my guild card.
[73:04.13]Hello there.
[73:04.69]Okay.
[73:07.47]Gotta go swimming now.
[73:10.32]Now, do I... Is there a certain place I have to go swimming?
[73:12.32]Or can I just go, like, in here?
[73:13.38]Or do I actually have to go to, like, a certain area for it?
[73:24.10]How do I see the status?
[73:25.50]Quest info...
[73:29.94]Guilt card.
[73:31.80]Get a rundown of what's going on.
[73:32.96]Okay.
[73:33.38]Farm status.
[73:33.96]Blue mushrooms.
[73:34.66]3 to 3.
[73:35.00]I guess I just have to go to the woods.
[73:42.79]Area 9 is the diving area?
[73:43.97]Okay.
[73:44.45]Oh, there we go.
[73:47.29]I hear about that ore you mine.
[73:48.39]Not bad.
[73:48.83]Now then, have a look at your map.
[73:50.07]See that?
[73:50.57]That hole of Moga Woods is open.
[73:51.93]Oh, shit.
[73:52.55]Wow.
[73:52.89]Everything opened up here.
[73:56.43]All the way to the sea, and that's good because I'd like you to go and hunt one of the molids that swim around there.
[74:00.79]Mold would be good practice for hunting underwater, and I'll wager you could use the practice.
[74:04.19]Besides, it would make a great gift for that gal in charge of finding you guild quests.
[74:07.97]Okay.
[74:09.77]Set up for area 11.
[74:12.75]Area 11.
[74:13.55]That looks like I go straight.
[74:19.13]I'm gonna go to the left.
[74:21.37]This way.
[74:27.03]This game will be confusing once you start, but give it a while and you'll love it.
[74:29.99]Oh, absolutely.
[74:30.61]I mean, I just haven't... Obviously... You guys have got your proper introduction to Kim and her fucking with me on the stream.
[74:38.97]Oh, and she'll be back and she's gonna do the same shit.
[74:41.61]She's gonna say all these things that are gonna make me be like... She's doing it for fun.
[74:54.48]I can go this... I've never been this way before.
[74:59.62]Can I not?
[75:01.14]Oh, I can climb it.
[75:04.95]My hands just, like, auto-extended.
[75:07.25]What the fuck was that?
[75:09.43]Uh-oh!
[75:09.83]Monsters!
[75:17.01]I kind of just want to charge this thing.
[75:18.89]Let's do a spin attack.
[75:20.81]Seems way more effective.
[75:23.05]If I actually go the right way.
[75:28.43]Oh my lord.
[75:28.99]Alright, let's get this straightened out here.
[75:41.41]Hammer?
[75:41.79]I'm not sure I like the hammer.
[75:44.29]It hits right in front of you.
[75:49.77]I think I like the sword better.
[75:50.67]Looks like this game would be fun.
[75:57.10]Well, there's like huge monsters in this game.
[75:58.76]I mean, it is Monster Hunter.
[76:05.95]These are new.
[76:07.53]These are new bugs.
[76:11.13]One hit kill.
[76:11.65]Cool.
[76:14.19]Come on down here.
[76:15.30]Come on.
[76:18.00]The great sword rules.
[76:19.78]Yeah, I'll be streaming this game again.
[76:21.06]This, honestly, I was having internet problems again.
[76:25.34]And I just kind of turned it on and made sure I could even turn it on today.
[76:29.76]It's been such a fucking pain in the ass, by the way.
[76:32.26]What?
[76:36.05]Did that just die?
[76:39.23]What is going on?
[76:41.74]I thought I just fucking died.
[76:43.90]Oh, okay.
[76:45.68]I gotta get used to the way this game works.
[76:48.33]How did that not hit him?
[76:50.33]How the fuck did I miss that?
[76:52.41]Oh my god.
[76:54.91]You know what?
[76:55.99]Fuck this.
[76:56.49]There we go.
[77:03.73]I need to go left.
[77:06.26]No, up.
[77:10.89]What do I think about the switch?
[77:11.83]I mean, it's probably going to be good.
[77:12.89]I'm not, like, a Zelda fan, though.
[77:15.51]Like, Breath of the Wild, eh.
[77:17.91]Shouldn't say that, would you?
[77:18.73]Wait, isn't this the way I go?
[77:19.81]How is that not the way I go?
[77:24.95]Can you lock on?
[77:25.57]There is no lock on.
[77:30.86]Um, it says to get over to this area.
[77:32.66]Can I, like, jump down this?
[77:36.00]On my map, this looks like the way to go.
[77:38.02]Whoa, okay.
[77:40.98]Okay, that is the way to go.
[77:46.78]Look, it's the fishes I need to kill.
[77:53.70]Okay.
[78:13.35]Ready to get your feet wet.
[78:14.13]Next up, let me instruct you in the moga art of swimming.
[78:16.27]No, you haven't eaten in the last hour, eh?
[78:18.39]No matter.
[78:19.19]Point the camera into the direction you want to swim, then move.
[78:22.23]Use the camera controls to change your view, and you'll swim in that direction.
[78:25.57]That's all there is to it.
[78:28.27]Okay.
[78:30.93]Alright, let's try to swim.
[78:32.54]Control pad to face the direction you want to swim, and then use the left stick to move.
[78:38.32]Is it like this?
[78:41.87]I guess, yeah.
[78:43.04]Easy enough.
[78:44.40]Alright.
[78:45.36]Fishes.
[78:46.54]Harpoon, though.
[78:47.92]Do I have it equipped?
[78:49.00]Do I even have it?
[78:52.06]Mega pickaxe.
[78:53.77]Herb.
[78:54.91]Hold on.
[78:55.43]Give me one second.
[78:56.73]I think she might be locked out.
[78:58.77]Give me a second.
[79:41.72]Wait, what?
[80:33.74]Okay.
[80:34.96]Let's keep going.
[80:37.48]There's one other thing I have to tell you about when you're swimming, try not to drop- OOOH!
[80:44.22]Thank God this popped up.
[80:46.62]Thank fucking God it popped up.
[80:48.66]Otherwise, I would have been dead.
[80:49.95]Okay, yeah, yeah, this is an oxygen bar.
[80:56.13]You know, if you'll breathe, it'll make your health gauge gradually decrease.
[80:58.77]Fortunately, there are three ways to refill your oxygen.
[81:00.79]Okay.
[81:00.99]Okay.
[81:02.71]Swim to the surface.
[81:04.70]We're at an air supply point.
[81:06.04]We're using an oxygen restoration item.
[81:11.80]Are the bubbles at the bottom of the floor?
[81:15.36]Once you get used to the camera controls, you should have no trouble finding these life-giving bubbles.
[81:18.48]Okay.
[81:22.31]I have actually plenty.
[81:23.69]There they are, right?
[81:24.81]Those look like bubbles to me.
[81:25.81]Right?
[81:28.79]Okay.
[81:33.79]At least I... Yeah, there they are.
[81:34.77]Okay, good.
[81:35.09]Alright, there they are.
[81:36.61]Hi, guys.
[81:42.35]What about the harpoon?
[81:46.85]Maybe I just don't... Do I have to equip it or something?
[81:48.67]I don't think I equipped it.
[81:51.05]Fuck it.
[81:51.37]We don't even need it.
[81:52.83]Unless it's a... Is it like an item that I have to put on?
[82:02.93]Any fish finder?
[82:06.17]No.
[82:09.07]Well, let's just kill them.
[82:10.07]Let's just get it over with.
[82:15.07]That was so fucking violent and blind.
[82:34.01]Return to village option has not been added to your game, and you're good.
[82:37.25]You can zip back to the village.
[82:38.37]It sure beats running.
[82:39.51]Once you get back to the village, talk to the girl.
[82:40.99]With all the quest info, she's starting to get impatient.
[82:45.82]Okay.
[82:49.68]I can't even tell... Are they gone?
[82:53.42]Did I get them?
[82:56.92]Apparently, they're dead.
[82:58.40]Okay.
[82:59.78]That's all I had to do, right?
[83:06.84]Put shit away in your item box in this game.
[83:09.65]You need to manage your slots.
[83:10.63]Okay.
[83:12.81]Makes sense.
[83:14.07]But also, I want to say, I want to run through some subs here.

[85:01.31]There you go.
[85:03.67]Sometimes I just abbreviate names.
[85:04.75]Not a big deal.
[85:08.27]And talk to the girl, right?
[85:09.23]Alright, give me some... Give me my first real, like, actual... Very, very long... Complicated game.
[85:17.69]I think, but... Let's see if we can get, like, a... Theory only quest.
[85:22.52]I've got you.
[85:22.92]So, let's collect a bunch of mushrooms.
[85:24.16]I don't want to get... I don't want to go collect mushrooms.
[85:33.44]Yeah.
[85:35.22]Can't go back to your house when you got a quest.
[85:37.06]You have to cancel the quest.
[85:39.30]Okay.
[85:44.69]What do we got?
[85:45.95]Oh boy, look at these.
[85:48.69]Harvest shrooms.
[85:51.81]Deliver three unique mushrooms.
[85:53.17]I think I already have them.
[85:58.29]Reward hits zero or time expires.
[86:00.53]Okay, just gotta get mushrooms.
[86:03.11]I think I might even already have them.
[86:05.92]Okay, can I... I brought them back.
[86:13.18]Hunter's notes.
[86:16.42]Um... No, I don't want to cancel it.
[86:28.08]Uh... Info.
[86:29.76]Quest info.
[86:31.64]Alright, deliver three unique mushrooms.
[86:33.76]Main monsters, Alteroth and Yaggy.
[86:39.09]If you have them, bring them.
[86:40.03]You can finish the quest in five seconds.
[86:41.42]Let me just check my box and see if I have anything.
[86:44.56]I can't even go in there.
[86:46.00]Okay, never mind.
[86:46.72]Oh, you gotta go left.
[86:50.26]I got it.
[86:50.70]Okay.
[86:53.50]Figured I'd just talk to these people first.
[86:55.32]I know it's tricky, especially if you're used to hunting on level ground.
[87:01.47]In the water, you have to maneuver up and down.
[87:03.29]At least you've got a good set of lungs.
[87:04.77]Kid, or so I hear, don't let a little water scare you off.
[87:07.01]Okay.
[87:11.21]1500 megahertz.
[87:12.82]Let's just start this.
[87:16.62]Depart on quest.
[87:18.74]Let's do it.
[87:30.91]I'm surprised I've been able to stay alive for this long.
[87:35.57]Just go collect them like you would regular mushrooms.
[87:37.81]Okay.
[87:40.16]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[87:40.90]Now that the camp is back on its feet, there's no better time to be a hunter.
[87:43.40]It's a catastrophe-proof industry.
[87:45.97]This camp serves as both the departure point and the end goal for your quests.
[87:49.61]Now this camp is equipped with three things to help you in your quests.
[87:52.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[87:53.89]Please ask.
[87:54.37]Please.
[87:54.59]I'll just tell you the red box, the blue box, and the bed.
[87:57.27]It's all you need in life.
[87:58.97]Practice your hunting, hunter.
[88:00.14]Have a look around and see if you can find all three of these illusive hunters.
[88:04.74]I have 50 minutes to find the red and the blue box.
[88:08.12]Oh, shit.
[88:11.04]Is this a red box oh good delivery box When quests require you to deliver items like this quest does this box will come in handy?
[88:19.99]We have items you were asked to deliver bring them to the delivery box see how much sense it all makes Didn't even notice what happened 100 bucks what?
[88:35.03]I'm like so busy just like reading this shit.
[88:42.82]Thank you, LDD, for the fucking hundred bucks.
[88:46.04]LDD714.
[88:50.05]They say, I love you, Jerma.
[88:52.93]Well, LDD, thanks a lot, man.
[88:55.45]Or woman.
[88:57.83]You're, uh... You're very fucking kind.
[89:04.16]Ignored?
[89:04.64]No, not ignored.
[89:06.60]How do you feel about your scam stream?
[89:11.57]$100 joke?
[89:13.63]No, there's no $100.
[89:14.43]I don't have any jokes right now.
[89:15.59]I'm playing Monster Hunter.
[89:18.27]But honest to God, dude, that's... We talk about it sometimes.
[89:23.17]Like the whole $100 shit.
[89:26.38]It's... I don't have much to say.
[89:29.58]That's fucking a lot of money.
[89:31.48]Thanks a lot.
[89:34.91]Gotta get my clown costume on again.
[89:36.29]I know.
[89:45.60]Free Kim?
[89:47.80]She's, uh, I think she's just upstairs.
[89:49.14]Okay, this is a supply chest to help me complete things.
[89:54.86]Okay.
[90:00.52]What's inside?
[90:03.36]A map of the hunting ground.
[90:04.50]Torch.
[90:05.62]There's a lot of shit in here.
[90:10.29]Portable whetstone.
[90:11.25]Normal S level 2.
[90:13.71]Specialized ammo.
[90:14.37]Are there guns in this game?
[90:19.21]Fuck, my pouch is full.
[90:20.17]What the hell is all this shit?
[90:24.60]Maybe I can remove this stuff.
[90:28.36]Eat the fucking burnt meat.
[90:35.14]Too distracting to the game.
[90:38.10]This is a game where I have to pay attention to them.
[90:40.74]It's hard to pay attention.
[90:44.97]Drop some shit.
[90:46.73]Let's drop some shit.
[90:49.63]Like this garbage, for instance.
[90:53.97]Warm pelt.
[90:58.13]Shroom Jerm I like just don't I don't know if I need to keep any of these things Insect husk I need to like store this stuff I'm starting to slowly understand how this game works And I think I'm really going to like it, but it's going to take a little while.
[91:13.92]I'm gonna play this off stream For sure and like get it going for real Because this seems like a lot of things I would need to know
[91:29.23]I remember when this was a clown stream.
[91:34.25]Um... I don't know.
[91:40.01]Not a mod.
[91:41.33]Range weapons are hard to use.
[91:42.45]I suggest using basic ones before using those.
[91:44.55]Okay.
[91:47.57]Let's see.
[91:47.99]I definitely need this map.
[91:50.19]That would be important, right?
[91:53.05]And a torch.
[91:55.33]Let's just try it.
[91:57.40]Alright, do I have the map equipped?
[92:02.95]Or do I just have to look at it?
[92:03.95]I wonder how that works.
[92:06.61]Map of the hunting ground.
[92:11.48]Would it just be like here?
[92:14.12]Possibly.
[92:17.80]Have a guide next to me.
[92:19.56]No, I'll just play.
[92:21.06]You just have to play to learn how to do shit like this, right?
[92:24.82]Monster Hunter 4 guy.
[92:25.90]Alright, this is the bed.
[92:27.76]I think I'm fine for now.
[92:45.30]Okay, where am I in the map?
[92:47.38]Here, okay.
[92:49.58]So, I'm ready to go, I think, right?
[92:56.76]I think we're just... We've got to tell you about the other key feature.
[93:00.65]Do you see the clock in the upper left?
[93:01.89]Yeah.
[93:03.11]Keeps track of the time.
[93:04.01]Watch as the white hand advances by one dot every five minutes.
[93:06.35]That makes the time limit for this quest 50 minutes.
[93:09.29]Run out of time and you'll fail the quest.
[93:10.75]Embarrassing.
[93:12.25]So, you better hustle.
[93:12.89]The clock starts flashing red.
[93:14.09]Alright, let's go.
[93:18.39]I need mushrooms.
[93:21.67]Just three unique mushrooms.
[93:26.35]Can I just run and grab them?
[93:27.41]They're right here.
[93:31.64]Blue mushroom.
[93:36.14]Blue mushroom.

[94:28.09]You can check out the completion requirements.
[94:29.68]Yeah, yeah.
[94:30.28]So, unique... Okay, it's actually a unique mushroom.
[94:33.62]Swap it with, like, the fucking bird fangs or something.
[94:36.50]Whatever.

[95:19.00]That's it.
[95:21.26]Easiest thing in the world.
[95:22.57]Wait, I don't care.
[95:23.85]Let's just finish this quest so we can keep going.
[95:29.63]For the horde.
[95:35.84]Excellent, fantastic, you've completed the quest.
[95:38.42]Next you receive the reward, then it's back to the village.
[95:40.04]Report your results to the guild.
[95:41.96]New quest for you.
[95:42.90]Good hunters are never unemployed.
[95:46.15]Okay.
[95:49.99]I feel like I'm going to actually really enjoy this game.
[95:54.83]There's probably a lot to it.
[95:59.67]I think he just teleports me back, right?
[96:03.70]Don't forget to drop useless shit in your box and try the greatsword.
[96:06.60]I'll do that when I get back, Stomp.

[96:24.24]Thanks a lot, dude.
[96:26.30]Alright, send them to the item box, because I can't even take them.
[96:32.20]I... I... This is... I just... I'm gonna have to, like, study.
[96:37.33]Five... Four thousand megahertz.
[96:39.39]Cool.
[96:41.41]It gets really good really fast once you understand it.
[96:46.59]Yeah.
[96:47.93]I can see that.
[96:55.74]Let's see what else is there to do.
[97:02.19]So this is one of those games that takes like four or five hours to really get going.
[97:05.97]But once it gets going, you like love it, right?
[97:12.09]Turkey burger boy.
[97:18.00]Bunch of new jobs for you this time.

[98:01.18]I don't have any other stories.
[98:02.76]Is there a faster way to do this?
[98:14.91]There's got to be a faster way to do this, right?
[98:19.59]Maybe not.
[98:26.12]Mega pickaxe, okay.
[98:33.37]You're shitting in a box?
[98:34.49]Are you a cat?
[98:37.09]Do guts, it's what's for dinner?
[98:38.07]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[98:42.59]Alright, well, I can store these herbs, too.
[98:44.79]I have potions.
[98:45.61]I'll be okay.
[98:47.11]Well, I can do herbs and mushrooms, right?
[98:57.60]Manage equipment.
[98:58.86]Did I get any new stuff?
[99:02.12]No.
[99:07.04]Metal bagpipe.
[99:09.32]What is that?
[99:11.44]Okay, we're using the giant horn.
[99:13.12]I'm sorry, guys.
[99:14.63]We're using the giant metal bagpipe.
[99:22.99]When you take your next quest, remember to eat a ration or two to bump your stamina bar.
[99:26.45]Good call.
[99:31.04]What the fuck is this thing?
[99:32.32]It really is a giant dreamcatcher.
[99:37.66]Save it.
[99:40.79]Hunting horn hype.
[99:46.21]Do the guts quest.
[99:47.05]It's what advances the story.
[99:48.27]Okay.
[99:48.69]We'll do it.
[99:51.21]Let's do it.
[99:55.29]We can take it off sub mode, by the way.
[99:57.71]Sub mode can come off.
[100:05.79]The reason my sub mode was on is... It can be taken off now.
[100:16.70]So is this... At least freedom.
[100:24.56]Freedom.
[100:34.35]Armor sphere.
[100:37.55]Upgrade armor.
[100:40.25]Okay.
[100:44.79]Armor craft, upgrade armor.
[100:49.21]Leather.
[100:49.55]I don't think I want to use it on this.
[100:51.73]Garbage, right?
[100:52.57]Why would I want to do that?
[100:58.37]Level up.
[101:00.63]No, I feel like I should hold on to that.
[101:07.09]Jaggy scale, ivy.
[101:11.19]Damn, this is a lot in this game.
[101:16.97]I'm free at last.
[101:19.17]Alright, let's just keep going.
[101:20.25]Let's just keep doing the quest.
[101:21.47]I can figure all this shit out another time.
[101:23.70]Offstream, and then the next time I turn the stream on, I can know exactly where I'm going.
[101:27.86]Let me... I have potions already.
[101:30.08]I'm sure this quest is not going to be that hard.
[101:33.16]Let's do guts.
[101:36.64]Three monster guts.
[101:42.02]Let's do it.
[101:47.93]The hunting horn is really hard to use solo.
[101:51.47]Well.
[101:57.57]Check the quest time limit.
[101:58.69]Take items from the supply box.
[102:04.86]It's unfortunate that a game like this has such a, like, dragged, dragged, dragged, dragged out beginning of the game.
[102:13.21]Because it's probably really, really awesome.
[102:19.51]I don't really care about this shit.
[102:23.65]Paintball.
[102:25.17]Torch.
[102:25.91]First aid.
[102:26.77]No, let's just kill monster gut shit.
[102:29.20]Who cares?
[102:33.54]Play co-op?
[102:37.32]Alright, can I get monster cuts from anybody?
[102:41.32]Find out.
[102:47.12]This thing is very large and sloppy, but I kind of like it.
[102:54.01]Where's the charge for this one?
[103:00.67]Do you play this song?
[103:01.65]Wait, let me just make sure.
[103:06.03]Rations in the map?
[103:06.79]Well, I mean, does it really matter?
[103:07.61]I mean, this is, like, a very easy quest, isn't it?
[103:11.93]Always take the stuff from the chest?
[103:15.53]I thought, like, moths... Yeah.
[103:16.74]Okay.
[103:17.02]From water.
[103:21.04]Hunting horn's your favorite.
[103:26.38]Um... Hold on a second.
[103:31.79]Basic controls...
[103:38.21]Should I go back and just get it?
[103:38.99]Or should I just go to the... I mean, I could get the map to know exactly where I'm going.
[103:47.37]But I think I could find my way to where I need to go.
[103:49.61]It's this way, right?
[103:52.55]Fuck the map.
[103:52.97]We're not going to use it.
[103:55.89]We're just going to make it to the water area.
[103:59.90]Water area.
[104:11.26]I'll give you one second, guys.
[104:12.35]I'll be right back in two seconds.
[106:58.26]Alright.
[107:02.10]Yeah, it was um... She wanted something to eat.
[107:05.46]She was wondering where she could go.
[107:08.48]I'm on a time limit right now, aren't I?
[107:10.06]Yeah, I'm on like a time limit.
[107:12.68]Whatever.
[107:13.74]Pressure.
[107:14.10]We do pressure on this stream.
[107:21.36]Swinging the horn plays notes when you get the correct notes in the music sheet.
[107:24.56]Really?
[107:25.42]Why is everybody fail fishing?
[107:30.07]Fail, what did I do?
[107:32.55]Can I get there through this way?
[107:34.04]I can go up here, right?
[107:39.10]What did I do?
[107:39.90]What did I do wrong?
[107:46.74]Oh, you guys planned that?
[107:47.88]You guys just being funny goofies.
[107:55.70]Now I can jump off this cliff, right?
[108:04.20]Now I'm underwater.
[108:05.12]Let's go get those fish guts.
[108:13.06]Hey, Black McGee, didn't you subscribe earlier?
[108:15.64]That thing is, okay, that thing is fucking huge.
[108:20.57]Oh, hold on a minute, I need to like pay attention to this.
[108:27.03]This thing might actually kick my ass.
[108:34.37]The Ligaracrus, the sea monster that's been tormenting our poor village.
[108:38.31]I must relax, breathe again.
[108:39.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[108:41.83]Please pick an area where the Ligaris is nowhere to be seen.
[108:46.11]You're no match for the creature right now.
[108:47.79]Live to hunt another day.
[108:51.13]What?
[108:55.89]How am I supposed to not be seen by him?
[108:59.34]He can just instantly see me.
[109:00.68]I jumped in the water.
[109:02.56]Oh, God.
[109:03.20]Oh, God.
[109:04.66]Just give me the fucking... Give me the bits.
[109:08.51]Not the bits.
[109:08.99]Give me the guts.
[109:13.09]Quick, give me the monster guts.
[109:15.43]Quick.
[109:16.85]Quick, put it away.
[109:17.65]Put the horn away and take this fucking guy's body.
[109:20.77]Come here.
[109:21.01]Come here.
[109:21.21]Come here.
[109:23.63]Monster guts.
[109:27.22]Why?
[109:27.50]Oh, God.
[109:27.82]He sucks.
[109:28.32]He can't hit me.
[109:29.14]Oh, okay.
[109:32.90]Give me the monster guns.
[109:35.78]I just need one more.
[109:37.32]Oh, shit.
[109:38.62]You wanna go, motherfucker?
[109:41.02]Oh, don't fight him.
[109:41.60]You're no match for this guy, huh?
[109:44.20]Okay, I really am no match for him.
[109:45.50]Terrible.
[109:52.52]Okay, I really am gonna die.
[109:53.86]Run.
[109:56.64]Bring me those healing potions.
[109:57.74]Please?
[110:00.44]Please?
[110:02.97]Please!
[110:03.67]What the fuck?
[110:09.97]I was trying to, like, drink a potion.
[110:11.33]Okay, so.
[110:12.71]Well, that was dumb.
[110:18.94]How come when I was selecting the potion, it was just unselected when I was doing this?
[110:23.48]Why was it doing that?
[110:27.53]Stupid.
[110:29.09]You guys saw that.
[110:29.97]I was doing this and letting go.
[110:31.67]And it wasn't staying on it.
[110:33.41]That was fucking dumb.
[110:43.09]This game is so fucking complicated.
[110:45.61]But I'm going to learn how to play it.
[110:47.86]Because I want to play it.
[110:49.26]But it's going to be fun.
[110:54.72]What a dumb map.
[111:02.19]I love how it told me, don't be seen by the thing, and I jump in the water and the thing's in front of me and I was seen instantly.
[111:11.81]Like, I'm gonna keep it on the potion.
[111:16.98]I didn't ask for a Dark Souls stream.
[111:21.88]This fucking game, this fucking stupid game is so stupid!
[111:24.60]It'll be fun, okay?
[111:25.56]Stupid!
[111:30.29]Let's do that again.
[111:31.69]That was no big deal.
[111:34.59]You can't drink potions when you're getting attacked?
[111:36.33]Really?
[111:37.22]So how are you supposed to heal?
[111:42.68]You were supposed to run away?
[111:43.70]Okay.
[111:48.58]Let's try that again.
[111:55.35]The game has a very steep learning curve, so be prepared to Google shit.
[112:01.67]I feel like there's a really great fucking game here, though.
[112:04.43]I'm gonna play it.
[112:06.43]I'm looking at the mini-map.
[112:07.17]I'm getting turned around.
[112:10.62]All the way around.
[112:11.50]Okay.
[112:12.32]Yeah, I'm looking down at my Wii U gamepad when I walk into walls, guys.
[112:21.18]Is that the right way?
[112:23.72]Yes.
[112:29.76]It's kind of like Dark Souls, but on a larger scale.
[112:33.44]That's cool.
[112:36.81]That's cool!
[112:41.09]Enjoy the bugs!
[112:45.55]The learning curve is difficult.
[112:46.49]I have an app for recipes on Monster Hunter 4.
[112:52.63]Let's try this again.
[112:53.41]This time I'm gonna try to run away.
[112:55.56]This game's better with friends.
[113:01.02]Okay, well where is that fucking giant monster?
[113:04.72]Where is he?
[113:05.02]Okay, I don't see him anywhere.
[113:09.49]Do you think I can just kill this shit and get it and leave?
[113:13.37]I think I can.
[113:14.59]Oh god, where is he?
[113:15.53]Oh god!
[113:17.49]Swim.
[113:17.87]Swim, swim, swim, swim.
[113:19.59]I'm supposed to run away.
[113:24.07]Oh, he just blew up my eardrums.
[113:28.11]No, run away, run away.
[113:29.57]How do I get out of here?
[113:30.75]How do I get out of here?
[113:31.66]I'm gonna get on the shore.
[113:37.65]Get me out of the shore.
[113:39.35]What am I doing?
[113:40.99]What's my character doing?
[113:45.37]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[113:46.75]Get up.
[113:48.35]I'm not sure where to go here.
[113:56.40]Should I fight this fucking thing?
[113:59.42]The lady told me to run.
[114:03.40]You can't beat him right now.
[114:04.46]So what am I supposed to do?
[114:10.56]Am I hitting an invisible wall right now?
[114:13.36]Yeah, this is a fucking invisible wall.
[114:15.06]What?
[114:21.42]Can I go this way?
[114:21.86]I got plenty of... I think I lost him.
[114:29.74]He's over there.
[114:30.20]He's over there.
[114:30.64]Okay, I think I can go down here.
[114:36.43]He's kind of in the way though.
[114:40.11]I can go that way, right?
[114:42.14]No, I'm going to go this way.
[114:43.94]I see the exit right over here, right?
[114:46.80]This way.
[114:52.14]Put the map... I'm looking at the map.
[114:53.68]I can see the map right here.
[114:54.38]I have the map on my gamepad.
[114:58.71]Okay.
[114:59.87]Well, there we go.
[115:02.63]That was terrifying.
[115:07.35]Now I can just kill these things and be fine.
[115:17.85]Just hit it.
[115:19.89]Hit the giant monster that I'm guaranteed to die if I go near.
[115:22.87]These guys only need one hit.
[115:29.61]Or two.
[115:29.83]Looks like two.
[115:34.64]That should be enough, maybe, right?
[115:40.18]Maybe.
[115:40.52]Maybe.
[115:50.39]If I had Germacon, what would it be?
[115:53.57]It would be a bunch of snakes.
[116:07.62]Is there a Kim and Star fight in the chat?
[116:15.06]Kim, all you need to know about Star is that he sucks.
[116:17.44]That's all you need to know.
[116:22.57]I think I have all three.
[116:23.23]I'm just kind of having fun.
[116:24.38]What are the notes on the top?
[116:29.02]Somebody was trying to tell me what they were.
[116:30.28]Monster bone S. Oh!
[116:39.38]What is he doing here?
[116:40.88]What the fuck is he doing here?
[116:42.62]What is he doing here?
[116:43.98]How do I get out of this?
[116:45.87]I gotta...
[116:50.76]Why is he here?
[116:52.25]He shouldn't be here.
[116:55.05]How do I get to the beach?
[116:57.05]How do I get to the beach?
[117:02.57]Please?
[117:03.31]Please?
[117:05.15]Wait a minute.
[117:05.61]Come here.
[117:06.99]Oh, you cheesy piece of shit.
[117:08.53]I'm gonna cheese the fuck out of this first boss.
[117:11.86]Oh, what's that?
[117:12.42]Sorry, buddy.
[117:14.32]Oh, wow.
[117:14.90]That's a nice lightning bolt you just did there.
[117:16.70]Have you seen my musical instrument?
[117:20.08]Come on.
[117:20.82]Get over here.
[117:24.18]Okay, don't fuck around.
[117:29.19]Go, go, go, go.
[117:30.57]Go.
[117:31.59]Get me out of here.
[117:34.77]Yeah.
[117:36.71]Fuck you, buddy.
[117:39.25]I'll drink to that.
[117:42.80]Did I get enough?
[117:46.06]I think I got enough, right?
[117:49.36]I probably didn't pay any fucking attention.
[117:52.95]He can go on land?
[117:54.57]Alright.
[117:56.15]Am I going the right way?
[117:57.93]What is connected to here?
[117:58.85]Ten and nine?
[117:59.65]Okay.
[118:04.03]Did I get three?
[118:05.17]I wasn't paying any attention.
[118:06.17]I'm electric right now.
[118:11.03]What the fuck is going on?
[118:13.31]How am I on land?
[118:17.94]That guy wasn't even paying attention.
[118:19.08]Attack deflection prevented?
[118:28.55]This thing is very awkward.
[118:30.59]Attack deflection... Can I stop playing this?
[118:33.43]Please?
[118:36.07]You got five?
[118:36.63]Yeah, I know.
[118:37.15]I wasn't really paying attention.
[118:38.75]There's no ground here.
[118:46.29]Secret stash.
[118:50.78]paw print stamp?
[118:54.16]So many fucking items.
[118:55.12]I feel like this is like Binding of Isaac.
[118:57.24]What the hell are you doing here?
[119:04.94]Oh, that's switching stances.
[119:06.34]I get it.
[119:10.64]You two are so hard to hit.
[119:12.04]There we go.
[119:16.67]Now I see why people tell me not to use this item.
[119:22.88]Alright, it's dead.
[119:25.90]It's not dead.
[119:26.76]Come on!
[119:30.59]Oh god, I like pray for a fucking logon.
[119:33.33]Really.
[119:34.19]Oh fuck these things, I'm outta here.
[119:46.48]Different attacks get different notes.
[119:55.39]Handsome boy plays shitty music for undeserving creeps.
[120:02.21]Down here.
[120:04.36]It's a little hard to use and you won't get lock-on for this game.
[120:09.40]It's the hunter horn as a starter.
[120:11.44]I don't know, it had a lot of damage.
[120:12.74]I was like, sure, why not?
[120:17.72]The game is designed around fighting big monsters, so fighting little ones is super awkward.
[120:23.69]That's it, right?
[120:26.32]Hey, look at that.
[120:27.50]Secret stash of monster guts.
[120:31.53]Wait.
[120:35.51]Did I not?
[120:36.39]I did it, right?
[120:36.85]I think I did it.
[120:43.40]You get lock-ons for big things.
[120:45.62]Yeah, there we go.
[120:50.78]Quest complete.
[120:56.63]You did it!
[120:58.93]What are the rewards?
[121:01.09]Uh, just sign up for the box.
[121:03.89]Monster.
[121:04.25]Handy material used to make everything from equipment to sundries.
[121:06.63]Okay.
[121:08.41]Sweet golden honey.
[121:09.23]Yeah, everything just goes to the box.
[121:11.99]Everything's gonna go to the box and I'm gonna read later online what this all does.
[121:17.36]Ignore the damage numbers when comparing to others.
[121:19.40]There's numerous factors when actually showing damage.
[121:21.48]A high damage weapon for one weapon could be crappy compared to the same number for another weapon.
[121:24.80]Okay.
[121:28.60]I'll change it then, though.
[121:29.80]I was liking the last thing I was using.
[121:43.49]Hey, thanks, Wolfie, for the sub.
[121:44.91]Welcome back.
[121:46.49]Tobster.
[121:47.97]Tanager.
[121:49.56]Thanks for nine months, dude.
[121:51.82]Stormflare.
[121:52.38]Thanks for the 15 months, Stormflare.
[121:56.16]That's a long time.
[121:58.18]Thanks, man.
[122:02.30]Also, Dr. Jensen, thanks for the 500 bits a little bit ago.
[122:05.73]Thank you, man.
[122:07.47]The music in the game is good.
[122:09.53]This game is cool.
[122:12.87]I'm not unimpressed.
[122:17.34]I just want to, like, tomorrow, or even probably tonight, I might play a bunch off-stream and just get to a position where I'm fighting big monsters.
[122:33.17]I'll stream tomorrow, too.
[122:34.52]Just because it's been such a mess recently.
[122:36.38]Because of the internet.
[122:41.44]Do Twitch IRL with auto?
[122:43.18]Can't believe you made it back.
[122:49.88]You're tough.
[122:50.74]I'm sure your luck played a part, too.
[122:52.68]Might still be out there, so keep your eyes peeled.
[122:54.28]Okay, here's what we got.

[123:02.62]Let's talk to the chief.
[123:12.63]You don't have to answer.
[123:13.15]I don't expect you to turn right.
[123:14.25]Yeah, I'll be honest.
[123:19.26]I'm going to like this game.
[123:20.24]I know I am.
[123:20.58]I can already feel it.
[123:27.42]I played for like 30, 40 minutes or so before the stream too and went through like the very, very initial tutorial.
[123:35.99]IRL park stream.
[123:40.25]I want to do like weird IRL streams like that.
[123:43.25]Be like fun.

[123:51.84]I am that hunter.
[123:59.76]yeah so the plan is here's what the plan will be after tonight I'm going to play a bunch off stream tomorrow and then tomorrow I will turn the stream on and hopefully at that point we'll be at a position where there'll be like a bunch of interesting shit to see thank you Funky Berlin for the 10 bucks I love this game use the switch axe weapon it's epic and crazy fun to use maybe I'll check it out
[124:30.90]Fishmongers, yeah.

[125:00.08]Asking all kinds of fucking questions.
[125:03.30]Punch the old man in the face?
[125:04.74]Thanks, Jensen, for the ten bucks.
[125:06.22]I don't think I can.
[125:08.74]Well, let's switch act.
[125:09.66]Let's try it.
[125:10.75]This is like a trial and error.
[125:12.05]I'm just gonna mess around.
[125:12.99]Do I have to make it?
[125:20.91]Switch acts.
[125:23.58]I need... I have the bones.
[125:25.35]I need malachite.
[125:26.85]No, that's not malachite.
[125:28.99]Matchalite.
[125:30.75]Monster fluid.
[125:31.47]I just need stuff.
[125:36.31]Okay.
[125:39.92]Oh, yeah.
[125:40.32]I already have one.
[125:40.90]Is one in the box already?
[125:41.70]Really?
[125:41.90]Let's go take a look.
[125:53.72]Switch axe.
[125:57.95]Oh, bone axe.
[125:58.57]There it is.
[126:01.27]What else?
[126:01.63]A bone blaster?
[126:02.65]Alright, let's put on the bone axe.
[126:08.79]What is this thing?
[126:12.91]This thing's crazy.
[126:14.63]It really is just a bone axe.
[126:21.09]Malachite axe.
[126:26.40]Now that sub mode is off, I really hope you get into this.
[126:28.42]It's a rough start, but awesome game.
[126:31.01]That's what people have been saying.
[126:32.25]So... I guess it's like a slog for the first five or six hours, right?
[126:41.05]It transforms.
[126:41.75]That's cool.
[126:42.05]Alright, should I do a quest?
[126:45.59]Or is there something else I need to be doing here?
[126:47.33]Oh, wait.
[126:48.19]I can go to my farm.
[126:48.93]Let me go to the farm after this.
[126:58.60]Hunting fleet.
[126:59.68]Okay.
[127:07.40]This is something I'm going to need to figure out.
[127:09.80]Not on stream.
[127:12.48]Dispatch.
[127:13.10]This is like Clash of Clans.
[127:14.96]Alright, do it.
[127:17.70]Dispatch.
[127:19.98]Go to the dark waters.
[127:24.42]And bring a power paddle with you.
[127:27.50]Why not?
[127:28.40]Okay.
[127:30.10]Go for it.
[127:30.48]I don't even know what this means.
[127:36.10]How's my week been so far?
[127:37.06]It's been great.
[127:40.99]This is going to do another quest.
[127:47.49]Harvest room.
[127:48.63]Prescription pickup.
[127:49.31]Golden fish opportunity.
[127:50.19]Let's do sunken treasures.
[127:53.59]Fish and Epioth.
[127:55.27]Terms, quest fee, limit 50 minutes.
[127:57.59]D Island.
[127:58.33]D!
[128:00.57]Eight red coral stones.
[128:06.18]Let's do it.
[128:12.54]Oh, I have to do a hunt, they come back with treasure.
[128:13.85]That's cool.
[128:16.17]Let's do it.
[128:24.13]Do the farm aid quest to unlock you.
[128:25.47]We'll do that after this.
[128:27.95]Mario Maker.
[128:28.61]No, we're not playing Mario Maker.
[128:31.59]Not a chance.
[128:35.37]Let me cook.
[128:36.55]I have food.
[128:37.07]Let me make it.
[128:38.19]I've had food since like the fucking two hours ago.
[128:41.93]Right, and I still have raw meat.
[128:42.93]Alright, this I'm not going to fuck it up.
[128:52.16]And... Done.
[128:54.75]Rare steak.
[128:55.47]Fuck.
[128:57.69]I wanted medium rare.
[129:06.34]And... There it is.
[129:08.32]Well done.
[129:12.88]Look up where the key quests are.
[129:13.80]They're not all essential.
[129:18.09]Wow, this thing's fucking cool.
[129:31.98]What's it going to do?
[129:33.84]Ooh!
[129:36.46]Turns out like a giant lance.
[129:41.98]Now let me eat that meat and then we'll get going.
[129:53.77]Wow, that's a lot of stamina.
[129:54.61]Alright.
[129:55.39]So I need to, what was it again?
[129:57.72]Sunken treasure.
[130:03.33]Deliver eight red coral stones.
[130:08.19]Okay.
[130:10.47]From area D?
[130:11.75]What didn't... Area D. Did it say, like, where I was supposed to be going?
[130:21.84]Local D island.
[130:25.12]Fish.
[130:25.36]Just the same fish area?
[130:32.46]Dive down and get me some red coral stones.
[130:34.26]Okay.
[130:34.68]I guess it's sick in the water.
[130:39.27]Just back in the water area where I was before.
[130:41.17]It's gonna go up.
[130:49.76]Let's-a go!
[130:50.20]Need to grind materials.
[130:57.25]Yeah, I'll do some of that stuff off stream.
[130:59.87]I'd rather stream me fighting giant monsters and that kind of thing.
[131:03.88]Let's test out this weapon.
[131:08.68]That motherfucker just took something from me.
[131:11.56]He just jump roped over me.
[131:15.80]You dead?
[131:18.89]I like the lance better.
[131:19.69]How'd that not hit him?
[131:27.56]Always take the stuff out of the boxes?
[131:29.10]Okay.
[131:37.41]Oh my god, this is fucking obnoxious.
[131:40.01]I'm not gonna lie.
[131:41.67]This shit is obnoxious.
[131:46.16]Like, why do they even have these enemies in the game?
[131:48.40]That's what I don't understand.
[131:50.70]Is there a reason to have those enemies in the game if they're that annoying to fight against?
[131:55.46]All these little enemies.
[132:07.32]The gun lance is your favorite?
[132:16.38]Oh my god, don't even... Thank god I still had it.
[132:24.79]Iron pickaxe is broken.
[132:26.99]What?
[132:28.13]Fuck.
[132:31.90]Just fill her.
[132:42.27]Alright, let's get some corals.
[132:44.93]Play through Dark Souls 2?
[132:46.15]I have played through Dark Souls 2 before.
[132:48.75]That fucking giant monster's not going to be in here, is he?
[132:53.00]Is he still here?
[132:56.18]Please don't tell me he's here.
[133:05.06]Still alive, no?
[133:06.54]That's weird.
[133:06.90]Okay, looking for a red coral.
[133:12.43]Red coral.
[133:27.36]I wonder if it grows not, like, in the water?
[133:30.24]I don't know.
[133:32.79]Up here, maybe?
[133:35.81]Loot the bones?
[133:38.45]Can I loot the bones?
[133:42.19]I'm looking for, like, red coral reefs.
[133:52.10]We can get in here.
[133:52.94]Let's see what's... Red coral stone!
[133:56.40]Hey, look at that.
[134:01.78]Jumbo pearl.
[134:02.44]Alright, let's just go to the... Whatever.
[134:09.10]Bone piles.
[134:14.64]Can I loot this guy?
[134:15.62]No.
[134:21.68]Have I ever played?
[134:22.40]This is the first time I've ever played Monster Hunter.
[134:24.74]Today.
[134:25.76]First time ever.
[134:30.97]No, that's a wall.
[134:35.13]I have no previous experience with this series at all.
[134:44.07]Go to area 10.
[134:47.05]I'll head there.
[134:47.51]I'm going there right now.
[134:53.13]I'm absolutely going to get the new Zelda game for sure.
[135:00.33]I better watch my oxygen.
[135:07.37]Red coral stones.
[135:08.31]Broken shell.
[135:09.01]Watch out for the shark.
[135:17.18]Put the map on the TV screen?
[135:19.48]Yeah, I could do that.
[135:20.16]It's probably not the dumbest idea.
[135:32.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[135:39.35]Ugh.
[135:46.34]Is that killing them?
[135:47.49]I don't understand if they're actually dying from that.
[135:54.77]Stream Breath of the Wild right now?
[135:56.68]The game's not even out.
[136:00.04]Breath of the Wild doesn't even exist right now.
[136:03.08]There's no release date for it, is there?
[136:07.97]I own a 3DS, but I have not turned it on in, like, two years.
[136:13.03]And, you know, it would sure be swell if I could actually, like, touch these bones.
[136:19.98]Oh, my God.
[136:23.32]Am I playing, like, Tomb Raider right now?
[136:25.60]Is this, like, Resident Evil fucking 2?
[136:28.34]Or what?
[136:32.76]Okay.
[136:33.64]Please.
[136:35.60]For the love of God.
[136:39.33]Alright.
[136:42.19]You're about to hear me say game sucks.
[136:43.95]It's gonna happen.
[136:48.35]Holy shit, that was annoying.
[136:54.27]Didn't even get it.
[136:54.77]What about these piles, huh?
[137:14.75]Do you keep your room below 70 degrees?
[137:16.23]What are you talking about?
[137:21.18]What's the... I need eight.
[137:24.70]I wish I could see how many I have.
[137:29.46]Is there a way for me to like to see that?
[137:32.68]I guess I can just go in here, right?
[137:34.22]I need one more.
[137:36.12]One more!
[137:37.66]And then we can get out of here.
[137:39.88]Do I don't have a pickaxe?
[137:50.79]Give me one more pile.
[137:52.51]Please.
[137:58.30]Please.
[137:58.80]Why do I have to click A three times?
[138:09.53]I guess it's just old school, right?
[138:14.37]Did I get all the bone piles that are here?
[138:19.02]Don't see any other piles.
[138:26.99]Shit.
[138:27.27]Well, maybe when I go the other way, it'll spawn another one in the other room.
[138:34.94]Do you want to aim like me?
[138:36.12]Use the special code.
[138:38.40]Yeah, really?
[138:43.14]Just go get me out of the water level.
[138:47.78]So when do you guys think that game development companies will stop putting water levels and poison swamps in their games?
[138:57.38]When do you think that's going to happen?
[139:01.28]I can't tell you one time I've ever played a video game.
[139:05.42]And we're talking in my entire life.
[139:10.01]My entire life.
[139:11.61]Where I've ever done a water level and said, that was fun.
[139:20.41]That has never fucking happened.
[139:25.61]God, you know what I really love about this game?
[139:28.27]Swimming slowly in the water.
[139:30.18]Man, that was... I loved that shit.
[139:34.50]That was... That was fucking incredible.
[139:40.85]There it is.
[139:41.37]Okay.
[139:41.57]Alright.
[139:48.71]Get me out of here.
[139:52.19]I think I have to wrap around.
[139:53.59]How do I get out of here?
[139:54.85]I have to go all the way back, too.
[139:55.87]Yeah, I have to go all the way back.
[139:58.77]Fantastic!
[140:02.03]This is the only Monster Hunter game with swimming, is it really?
[140:10.07]4U had no water levels.
[140:10.99]How come it's not on the Wii U?
[140:15.47]Why won't they put it on the Wii U?
[140:17.44]I want to be able to play it on Wii, not on 3DS.
[140:26.16]Can I go this way?
[140:29.38]Yeah.
[140:33.20]There we go.
[140:35.78]Check for secrets.
[140:36.70]I don't think there's any secrets.
[140:45.83]There we are.
[140:46.71]I just have to go this way, right?
[140:51.11]What is down... Can I like do this?
[140:52.85]Is this really a little skip or something?
[140:56.13]I kind of want to know what this is.
[140:58.09]It's like, where's this going to put me?
[141:03.31]What does this do?
[141:08.60]Alright, that's a nice little skip.
[141:10.02]Good.
[141:12.58]Go, Janelle.
[141:24.13]And turn it in.
[141:26.45]I want to at least see one big monster before I end the stream.
[141:30.33]Before I like stop playing and play it off stream.
[141:32.80]And get to a point where we can see big monsters.
[141:36.94]Press A and X together for an attack?
[141:39.84]Let me try that.
[141:42.02]Ooh.
[141:43.93]Interesting.
[141:48.65]That was cool.
[141:56.46]No big monsters in this quest.
[141:57.86]Oh well.
[142:04.68]We'll do the farm-made one.
[142:07.38]Yeah, I saw a Ligarius, but I didn't get to fight him.
[142:13.07]Rest in peace, Mega Pickaxe.
[142:15.53]Oh well.
[142:17.37]Oh well.
[142:32.57]Oh, that's a lot of ore.

[142:41.42]I have a lot of money.
[142:42.02]Alright, we'll do the farm quest.
[142:49.28]And we'll see where we're at after that.
[142:56.43]Future.

[144:57.71]Call your friends.
[145:00.17]Let them know what happened.
[145:03.13]Can you eat more than one ration to max your stamina?
[145:04.99]Okay.
[145:07.06]I'm rioting because of peer pressure.
[145:10.46]Why am I sneaking around?
[145:21.51]Where are your friends?

[145:35.80]They have to kind of just explore and find them?
[145:48.32]I only have these certain areas here.
[145:49.82]Unless there's something I'm missing.
[145:53.32]If I'm missing something, I'm missing something for sure.
[145:54.70]Is that herbs?
[145:58.80]What?
[146:08.27]They're not in the water?
[146:09.13]Okay.
[146:15.58]Look for their nest with me, old bones.
[146:18.16]Whoa, watch it.
[146:23.94]I don't think they're in this cave.
[146:30.91]Honey's a very useful item.
[146:33.20]Put this thing away.
[146:33.80]I'm just going to run.
[146:35.12]I'm going to go to area four.
[146:37.49]Okay, that was area four.
[146:42.77]I guess I will just go there.
[146:43.67]They should be in six.
[146:46.77]I guess I'll go through four to get to six, I guess.
[146:51.53]Super confused.
[146:56.76]Hop down.
[147:04.81]What is extreme content?
[147:11.83]Tell me a story?

[148:17.58]Two more of the big ones.
[148:20.32]Got it.
[148:25.94]Let's reload this area two more times or something.
[148:27.88]Okay.
[148:38.76]There's still stuff in there.
[148:40.67]Give it to me.
[148:44.55]That was the joke that your grandmother told us?
[148:47.19]Oh, I forgot that was from last night.
[148:49.90]I'm just going to reload this place.
[148:56.50]Or do I need to?
[148:59.16]Oh, this one right here, right?
[149:18.48]One thing that's going to take a lot of getting used to is how long it takes for you to move after you swing your weapon.
[149:25.66]So, like, I'm swinging and I'm holding right right now.
[149:28.82]Like, that is so long.
[149:30.96]I gotta get used to that shit.
[149:33.95]Maybe the weapon's really heavy as well, but it's going to take some getting used to.
[149:44.48]Orange dinosaurs.
[149:53.51]Axe attack fills it up and sword attack drains it.
[149:56.51]Really?
[149:57.03]Okay.
[150:00.03]Dodge out of your animations?
[150:03.07]I guess... Yeah, I mean, I guess that is kind of helping a little.
[150:11.62]Dodge cancel.
[150:12.20]Okay.
[150:12.32]Okay.
[150:15.41]I'm learning.
[150:15.79]Let's reload six again, and that should do it.
[150:23.65]Animation cancels have been a game since 2012.
[150:24.99]Come on, now.
[150:25.82]Yeah, well, I mean, even with the animation cancel, it's like... It's still like a good quarter of a second.
[150:35.02]Like, I'm mashing it.
[150:38.10]Hmm.
[150:45.41]That's actually better.
[150:46.19]Yeah, that's better.
[150:51.17]Alright, where the hell are these guys?
[150:57.01]Come on.
[150:58.59]I need one more, don't I?
[151:00.85]Fuck.
[151:02.65]I can't just like... What's going on?
[151:06.42]What's this blinking?
[151:11.70]Um...
[151:16.63]Your weapon is trash.
[151:19.92]I have no idea what's good or bad.
[151:22.02]I'm gonna go this way.
[151:39.97]Like, you guys could tell me literally anything.
[151:42.33]And I would probably be like, oh, that's better?
[151:43.97]Okay, great.
[151:45.93]I have no goddamn idea what's going on.
[151:51.77]Let's go up to five, though.
[151:59.73]Camera, what are you doing?
[152:04.15]Just use what looks cool.
[152:04.97]Oh, I don't want to go that way.
[152:15.06]Only kick?
[152:20.37]Here we are!
[152:20.93]Hello.
[152:22.89]Oh lord.
[152:28.07]Okay, hold on.
[152:28.81]I gotta be careful here.
[152:29.73]Oh, easy.
[153:00.33]I need to like, know the combos too.
[153:02.34]God, I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[153:04.36]Fuck!
[153:09.44]I need to go study like the fu- Remember back in the day when games had the game manual inside the box?
[153:18.61]I need that for this game.
[153:20.53]I need the fucking in-the-box game manual.
[153:23.23]Otherwise this game's unplayable.
[153:29.76]I bought the digital copy, I don't even have the game manual!
[153:45.65]There is a manual.
[153:47.85]You want to go read the manual?
[153:53.21]Let's go.
[153:54.11]Teleporting me back, right?
[154:08.76]Jesus Christ.
[154:21.56]What, a 780 streamer?
[154:22.82]Nah, I'll get to him in a minute.
[154:31.01]Alright, let's fight the first giant monster.
[154:36.37]Read the Monster Hunter lore on stream.
[154:40.12]I could do that.
[154:42.61]Hey, Chad, thanks for the sub.
[154:44.19]Likespancakes, thanks for the sub.
[154:45.73]Malecatgirl, 717crow, wittybaton65videos, thanks for the sub.
[154:51.22]Your friend SauceArmboard, the Endermaster, thanks a lot, guys.
[154:55.22]Welcome to the channel.
[154:56.16]Welcome back.
[154:59.82]Read the manual or riot.
[155:03.26]Quest can take upwards of 30 minutes, so one minute isn't really that long.
[155:07.07]That's true.
[155:10.87]Okay.
[155:12.17]So now that opened up potentially something else, right?
[155:20.68]Brand new monster slaying request.
[155:22.86]Ludroth.
[155:26.08]Carnivorous monsters that live near water prone to violence.
[155:28.84]Jeepers Creepers.
[155:29.54]Well, it's been nice working with you.
[155:31.03]I mean, I don't worry.
[155:31.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[155:32.93]This is a Moga Woods monster.
[155:34.77]So what do some writers know?
[155:38.05]You'll be fine, probably.
[155:40.64]Okay.
[155:40.74]Here are the drop requests.
[155:46.41]Urgent quests.
[155:47.41]No love for Ludroth.
[155:49.55]Slay six Ludroth.
[155:54.27]Right.
[155:56.83]Okay.
[155:57.39]D Island D. Uh, not yet.
[156:05.04]I want to... I want to get some, like, better armor or something.
[156:14.10]Head.
[156:14.36]There you go.
[156:15.58]Chainmail headgear.
[156:19.38]Thunder and -2 for thunder.
[156:20.70]That doesn't sound good.
[156:21.36]Well, I'm going to buy it.
[156:22.12]Fuck it.
[156:24.42]This will get you level two.
[156:34.13]Go to the town and get shitfaced.
[156:38.95]We're nearing the end of the tutorial.
[156:40.25]Okay.
[156:41.29]Should I... Is this a waste if I buy this?
[156:44.03]Wait, what?
[156:50.37]Like, if I buy this, is this a terrible idea?
[157:03.22]You're gonna have a swell time learning about armor skills.
[157:09.68]It's a waste, okay.
[157:13.52]Well, if you can already tell, I already did it on my chest.
[157:23.70]Okay, yeah.
[157:24.54]So, we'll just buy a couple of these.
[157:25.80]I have money.
[157:27.22]Let's buy... I already have a vest.
[157:33.69]With a head.
[157:37.01]Just get the cheap shit.
[157:42.83]Arms.
[157:43.15]We'll get a set of the cheap shit, you know?
[157:51.99]And then we'll get this one... This quest done.
[158:01.68]Okay.
[158:02.94]Let's go to the box.
[158:04.46]Don't buy this shit?
[158:05.38]Why not?
[158:08.92]Is there a reason why you shouldn't be buying this?
[158:12.20]Jerma confirmed to be bad at Monster Hunter.
[158:14.50]Or Jerma confirmed to have never played a Monster Hunter in his entire life.
[158:19.06]And this is the first time he's ever played two hours ago.
[158:22.77]That could be a reason too.
[158:28.91]You can't know everything.
[158:30.71]You can't know how to play a game before you play it.
[158:35.09]Right?
[158:36.04]Doesn't that make sense?
[158:45.23]What else did I get?
[158:57.56]Hold down the rest button?
[159:06.10]Read the paper manual.
[159:15.02]You can't know everything?
[159:15.78]That's the opposite of what the internet led me to believe.
[159:20.32]I'm just learning how to play the game.
[159:26.79]I'm just learning how to play.
[159:35.01]Let's just do it.
[159:40.60]Six loot drops, let's just go.
[159:54.43]You got the whole set.
[159:55.36]You're absolutely fine.
[159:56.34]Did I just buy, like, a set that has, like, a shitload minus of the enemy I'm fighting?
[160:06.78]Okay.
[160:11.58]The Luthra might be just a bit stronger than what you're used to.
[160:16.55]You're ready and you're ready to go.
[160:17.49]Of course you are.
[160:17.99]Just go.
[160:18.71]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[160:20.83]Time loot, 50 minutes.
[160:21.87]Alright.
[160:31.35]Let's eat some food.
[160:32.87]Eat a rare steak.
[160:40.07]Why not?
[160:47.71]Whatever.
[160:49.14]That's all I really need.
[160:52.48]Put on my healing potions.
[160:59.36]50 minutes.
[160:59.60]Go, go, go.
[161:00.08]You don't have much time.
[161:03.59]Alright, well, I need to go to water, right?
[161:07.86]Should I go up to five and then left to six?
[161:10.64]Let's do that.
[161:16.27]Is it true that I beat Dancer of the Bororeal Valley in my first try?
[161:18.85]Yup.
[161:31.58]I wonder, nine or ten?
[161:33.03]I think, I would think that those are the most, um... You can eat before you go on hunts.
[161:38.03]Yeah, okay, cool.
[161:40.49]Yeah, I don't mind you guys giving me tips and, you know, telling me where things are and what things to do.
[161:44.41]I mean, I know the game is very, very unforgiving in that sense.
[161:55.10]Um, okay, here we go.
[162:03.24]Did I beat Dark Souls 3 without a guide?
[162:05.54]Yeah!
[162:07.44]Oh, watch out for the serpents!
[162:08.68]Oh fuck, that's the fucking Earth serpent.
[162:10.71]And that's the water serpent.
[162:13.65]Alright, this might be like the first real challenge of the game.
[162:21.82]I feel like that hurts.
[162:35.53]Wait, what happened?
[162:36.27]She needs, like, an iPhone charger?
[162:37.55]Hold on.
[162:38.95]Give me a second.
[162:50.74]Okay.
[163:46.90]Silence.
[163:47.78]There it is.
[163:48.58]We're back from the silence.
[163:49.47]No, we weren't silent.
[163:53.33]How many do I have to kill?
[163:58.95]Three more.
[164:01.38]Are these in the water?
[164:07.28]Like, I guess?
[164:09.22]Yeah, okay.
[164:09.70]I'm not gonna get, like, snuck up on, am I?
[164:13.78]There's one here.
[164:19.80]Well, that hurt a lot.
[164:26.75]Shit.
[164:29.03]Wrong button.
[164:35.22]Am I gonna die or what?
[164:44.74]Part 2 out of 135, no commentary.
[164:51.27]Alright, I just tried to press A, and it just swam the other way.
[164:57.58]Two more.
[165:03.74]I chose an annoying character voice?
[165:04.90]Yeah, I did.
[165:09.38]He sounds like Link.
[165:11.75]Uh, where the hell is this last one?
[165:15.21]Two more.
[165:21.39]Please tell me that as the game goes on, we don't have water levels anymore.
[165:25.19]Or do I have to deal with these for the rest of the game?
[165:39.67]Okay.
[165:40.04]Well, I guess we just have to keep going until like 11.
[165:51.67]I'm going to give me one second.
[165:53.57]No, actually, hold on.
[165:54.19]Let me kill these two, and then while it loads, I'm going to be right back.
[166:00.85]I'll BRB after these two things are dead.
[166:10.92]Or maybe I'll die.
[166:15.44]There it is.
[166:16.36]Hooray!
[166:16.72]Alright.
[166:18.92]I'll be right back.
[166:19.88]T-break.
[166:20.34]I'll see you in a second.
[167:00.08]Thank you.
[167:51.26]Alright.
[167:56.14]Quest complete.
[168:03.63]Wait, what happened?
[168:08.07]I'm done, right?
[168:09.53]I got it.
[168:15.46]There goes his stuff.
[168:24.96]Alright, we're gonna get our first, like, big boss, right?
[168:33.40]Thank you, Toast, for the sub.
[168:35.08]Slug Christ, thank you for the sub.

[168:53.45]Thank you for those bits.
[168:55.84]Alright, let's fight.
[168:56.60]Let's do it.
[168:58.00]Let's fight the first major boss.
[169:05.98]Major boss.
[169:06.60]Yeah, right.
[169:07.04]Okay.
[169:12.12]Is it just her?
[169:22.76]A new hunting ground.
[169:26.66]Okay.
[169:29.23]Sandy Plains.
[169:37.27]A lot of info.
[169:38.55]Very huge amount of info.
[169:44.67]Okay, there's a quest to hunt the Great Jagi.
[169:49.60]Okay, let's do it.
[169:53.45]I guess the target cam is for you.
[169:55.35]Ooh.
[169:55.81]Hey guys.
[169:57.00]Here's how you lock on Press the ZR button to use target cam It's the L button when the top right monster icon changes then just press the L button Okay Alright
[170:22.45]Bug hunt?
[170:22.93]Where's the... Secret of the Bug Harvest?
[170:26.67]Where's, um... Where's the quest for the great jagi?
[170:41.08]Bug hunt?
[170:42.02]No.
[170:44.40]There it is.
[170:44.92]Hunt a great jagi!
[170:47.64]Let's do it!
[170:53.84]We're going in hot.
[170:58.62]Jag-eye.
[171:05.65]Just press the monster thing on your gamepad.
[171:08.89]Two star quest, bud.
[171:10.16]Yeah, we're moving on up in the world.
[171:17.04]Don't know.
[171:18.54]What do you mean, don't know?
[171:26.79]Alright, jag-eye.
[171:27.55]Where's the jag-eye?
[171:35.97]This is gonna be good?
[171:36.85]Oh, great.
[171:40.81]Jag-off?
[171:41.49]We're gonna go fight the great jag-off!
[171:51.24]I forgot to eat shit!
[171:52.06]Oh, shoot!
[171:58.17]It's alright.
[171:58.57]I'm going to beat this guy first try.
[172:03.74]Blar.
[172:04.40]Like my battle cry?
[172:05.22]I'm here to inspire you to have a great hunt.
[172:06.52]Did it work?
[172:07.10]How about now?
[172:09.36]Alright.
[172:09.58]Your target this time is a great jagi.
[172:10.92]This big fella is much tougher than anything you've had to hunt before.
[172:15.19]They say a great jagi can boss around jagi.
[172:18.42]They say a great jag-off can boss around.
[172:20.30]They say a great jag-eye can jag-off a great jag-off, organizing them to attack you in a pack.
[172:24.73]Oh, isn't Mother Nature wild?
[172:26.65]Great jag-eyes are also smart enough to run away when they're in trouble starting to miss that fishing quest, aren't you?
[172:31.63]No, because it was in the water.
[172:32.71]Sorry.
[172:33.67]But don't despair.
[172:34.30]You should find a paintball in the supply box and one high-end-y item, splat a monster with it, and you'll be able to track the beast on the map.
[172:43.81]Paintballs are a perfect way for wussy monsters who try to flee.
[172:46.15]Let them, yo, see where they roam.
[172:49.73]Start the quest off right with a battle cry together.
[172:51.57]Ready?
[172:51.89]One, two, three.
[172:52.83]Ah.
[172:53.67]Okay.
[172:57.84]Isn't Mother Nature wild?
[173:00.64]Who the fuck is this?
[173:08.56]Ration.
[173:09.40]Okay, hold on.
[173:13.82]He just gives me a bunch of shit?
[173:18.44]Thanks, man.
[173:19.74]Thanks, Dobby.
[173:22.10]Hey, Dobby, can you, like, snap your fingers and get me to safety?
[173:26.11]I'm sorry.
[173:28.41]That was not funny.
[173:33.51]That would have been funny if the delivery was a little bit better, but that delivery was lacking, I will say.
[173:37.65]Alright, I need a paintball.
[173:47.03]Paintball.
[173:50.03]Paintball.
[173:50.83]Toss this scented paint at a monster to mark it, allowing you to track its position.
[173:55.73]Can't wait to fuck this up.
[174:02.14]Get out of the cauldron, Dobby.
[174:05.26]Now let's take a look at the item pouch.
[174:06.50]Let me eat those rations.
[174:09.68]Let's go kill this monster.
[174:11.57]What do you say?
[174:12.01]Okay.
[174:21.15]Okay, good.
[174:22.47]Paintball.
[174:24.75]There it is.
[174:26.29]So I have to throw this at the Great Jag-Eye?
[174:30.47]Where the hell is the Great Jag-Eye?
[174:33.03]What direction is it in?
[174:35.81]I'm assuming it's going to be like 1.
[174:42.18]Put on Acid Base.
[174:44.36]You got it.
[174:55.52]Always take the healing items every time.
[174:57.16]Okay.
[175:06.65]I'll get it.
[175:06.95]Don't worry.
[175:07.19]I'm going.
[175:08.87]I'll get that cool drink.
[175:16.72]Extreme heat.
[175:25.19]Okay.
[175:27.21]Uh... Alright.
[175:30.49]You have to hunt the monster.
[175:31.73]Alright, let's hunt him.
[175:32.75]I'll find him.
[175:36.81]There'll be a cutscene when you find it.
[175:37.99]Okay.
[175:38.13]Let's go this way.
[175:50.81]I'm assuming he's going to be a huge version of these things, right?
[176:03.59]Full punch.
[176:18.43]Throw the paintball at every enemy?
[176:20.39]Should I really be doing that?
[176:24.19]Four.
[176:28.53]I'll put it away.
[176:29.07]Let's just go.
[176:35.55]Cave.
[176:36.03]Deep cave.
[176:36.59]If I'm a great jag guy, I think I'm in here.
[176:45.46]Or in one of these deep cave areas.
[177:01.04]Alright, well, never mind.
[177:02.48]Alright.
[177:04.72]Not that way.
[177:05.24]I'm going back.
[177:13.88]Fishing is 300 bucks.
[177:23.12]Uh-oh.
[177:24.96]Oh, boy.
[177:25.38]I gotta get acid base ready.
[177:27.24]I'm not ready for this.
[177:32.14]Shit, I'm not ready for this.
[177:35.50]Oh god, he's huge.
[177:36.98]Acid base.
[177:37.56]Where is it?
[177:41.83]Quickly.
[177:42.83]Quickly.
[177:50.19]I can't get it.
[177:56.88]Got it.
[178:10.12]I'm gonna do it.
[178:11.02]First try.
[178:12.12]Paintball.
[178:14.42]Lock on.
[178:14.74]Get it!
[178:15.72]Got him!
[178:16.91]Come on!
[178:38.70]Oh, it's so- oh, no, wait, wait, stop, hold on a second.
[178:42.04]That's so fucking loud.
[178:43.70]That is loud.
[178:44.32]I'm sorry that's so loud.
[178:45.88]Turn your music down.
[178:51.14]Oh, shit.
[178:54.69]Oh, god.
[178:56.75]Why won't this lock on?
[178:57.83]I thought it was supposed to be L. There we go.
[179:07.71]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[179:18.28]It's just, it's just so fucking sloppy.
[179:22.52]It's like I might as well be eating like a sloppy Joe right now than playing Monster Hunter.
[179:41.93]This has got to turn off.
[179:42.83]I got to concentrate.
[179:43.89]I can't concentrate like that.
[179:50.41]I'm dead.
[179:50.83]I'm so dead.
[179:58.19]Come on!
[179:59.33]Yes.
[180:01.09]You don't have to flex after you eat something.
[180:02.75]What the fuck?
[180:07.05]Hey, you know what?
[180:08.45]After you eat a healing item, makes the fucking character flex.
[180:11.85]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[180:14.75]Yeah.
[180:15.29]There's not like an extreme danger right now.
[180:20.95]He got away.
[180:28.30]Where the fuck did he go?
[180:28.96]I threw that paintball at him.
[180:31.06]Where is he?
[180:42.09]Where did he go?
[180:49.71]That's why you paintballed him?
[180:50.75]How come I can't... Different area.
[180:53.63]Okay.
[180:56.57]Take a look at the map.
[180:57.93]Oh god, he's down in seven right now.
[181:00.67]Son of a bitch.
[181:08.99]Check the map.
[181:10.85]I didn't want to go there.
[181:13.01]I didn't want to go there.
[181:15.85]I did not want to go there.
[181:17.31]At all.
[181:20.79]I wanted to go this way.
[181:28.72]Now this time I'm going to kill the little babies first.
[181:42.53]Alright, here we go.
[181:43.31]Let's fight it again.
[181:44.05]Oh boy.
[181:50.49]Whoa!
[182:12.47]I still don't understand this lock-on thing.
[182:14.65]It looks like it's trying to do it, but it just doesn't want to do it.
[182:17.69]Like, I'm tapping L right now.
[182:20.01]And it's just like, nope.
[182:20.91]There we go.
[182:25.21]Fuck the lock-on.
[182:26.67]No, no, no, no, no.
[182:27.39]Don't run away.
[182:27.89]Don't you run away from me.
[182:29.27]Don't run away.
[182:30.31]Don't run away.
[182:31.07]God damn it.
[182:34.36]Well, now he's in two.
[182:44.54]Die!
[182:45.80]Die!
[182:58.54]Oh, there's no full lock on that guy.
[183:01.65]I get it.
[183:07.41]Watch it.
[183:09.27]Don't fucking flex again.
[183:10.77]I'm gonna die.
[183:13.75]I'm so dead.
[183:20.76]Come on.
[183:21.82]Don't flex.
[183:22.78]Don't do that shit.
[183:36.65]Come here.
[183:37.29]Oh, I don't love it.
[183:43.79]God.
[183:44.17]Oh, my God.
[183:45.11]Oh, my God.
[183:45.69]Enough.
[184:01.62]Die, please!
[184:02.88]I did it!
[184:06.52]Skin him!
[184:07.42]No, skin him!
[184:12.04]What?
[184:12.52]He's still alive.
[184:14.24]Oh, fuck.
[184:25.88]Come on, die!
[184:31.82]What?
[184:32.62]What is he doing?
[184:35.00]What is he doing?
[184:37.44]He's like limping away.
[184:39.82]No, don't.
[184:41.90]What the fuck is happening?
[184:44.74]Where is he going?
[184:46.57]What?
[184:46.77]What?
[184:46.97]Where did he go?
[184:48.27]Oh.
[184:59.71]Hold on, let me eat some... I don't even fucking know what to say.
[185:09.43]How do I get... I need to eat, like, food or something.
[185:14.83]Where is he?
[185:15.29]He's at four?
[185:16.67]That means I gotta go for three.
[185:18.17]How do I heal out of combat?
[185:21.99]I don't have any more potions.
[185:24.24]I have, like, the cold drink.
[185:25.54]I have raw meat.
[185:29.89]Oh, I do have potions.
[185:30.65]Alright, eat these, quick.
[185:31.31]Alright, go.
[185:36.12]Go free.
[185:43.44]I have- I gotta sharpen my shit, too.
[185:52.11]Yeah.
[185:53.29]Straight up, he'll be right here.
[185:58.37]Oh, the thrill of the hunt!
[186:05.89]There he is.
[186:07.33]Where's he gone?
[186:12.27]Oh, there's so many stupid enemies here too.
[186:13.93]Come on, get out of here.
[186:20.54]Oh lord.
[186:23.98]This is not good.
[186:29.40]He's not- Shit, he's running away again.
[186:31.40]What the fuck?
[186:34.48]He wasn't limping like that before.
[186:37.92]Seriously, that was... He wasn't limping before.
[186:42.16]He ran full speed at me.
[186:45.50]Alright, I'm just going after this guy.
[186:47.12]Fuck this.
[186:51.64]Now he's just asleep over here.
[186:55.04]Rise and shine, motherfucker!
[186:56.58]You thought you were going to be able to go to bed?
[187:00.92]Nope.
[187:05.63]Get out of town!
[187:13.61]Die, please!
[187:21.58]Got him!
[187:22.06]Dead!
[187:23.02]Dead!
[187:24.18]Got him!
[187:29.86]Oh, I forgot about the charge attack.
[187:31.18]It's all good.
[187:40.60]Exciting!
[187:48.15]That was fun.
[187:49.83]Okay, if that's like what the game is, this is a fun game.
[187:57.15]If there's more of that, then hell yeah.
[188:06.06]Carve him, carve him, carve him, carve him.
[188:08.32]I'm carving, I'm carving, I swear.
[188:10.20]I promise.
[188:11.28]Skin it, carve it quick.
[188:14.36]I did it.
[188:14.88]It's fine.
[188:16.16]What else is in here?
[188:16.74]What's that?
[188:19.02]Digging the trash.
[188:24.66]Okay.
[188:26.80]Alright.
[188:27.80]Cool.
[188:28.92]That's exactly what the game is.
[188:30.10]Then fuck yeah, this game's awesome.
[188:33.84]I'm looking forward to playing that game and learning how to play it.
[188:37.28]A lot of cool shit.
[188:46.06]Okay.
[188:49.29]Look at that.
[188:50.43]Your best.
[188:53.15]Oh, they actually have different... Okay.
[188:58.95]They have different sizes?
[189:00.77]That's kind of cool.
[189:05.03]Can you hunt monsters in this game?
[189:13.28]Alright, so here's the plan right now.
[189:16.56]I'm just going to save the game.
[189:19.02]I'm going to turn the stream off right now.
[189:26.29]And tomorrow, I'm going to play and get a little bit more situated and more understanding of what's going on.
[189:36.16]I'm gonna do some reading, I'm gonna do some research, and tomorrow's off schedule, but I'm gonna stream tomorrow.
[189:40.50]I'm gonna stream this tomorrow.
[189:46.28]Because I, like, want to know more about... Before I, like, keep going, I'd like to know more of what the hell I'm doing and what I'm talking about.
[189:55.03]So tomorrow, expect me to stream off schedule for about, like, I'd say, like, four or five hours.
[190:03.47]I am shocked that I was able to stay online this long just because of my internet problems.
[190:09.81]And I'm going to like... I could see myself playing this game and enjoying it a lot.
[190:13.31]So... For all my stupid complaints, this is going to be a very enjoyable game, I think.
[190:23.87]I'll hop in the Discord as well tomorrow, like early afternoon, like somewhere on like... I'll probably stream tomorrow like afternoon, late afternoon maybe.
[190:31.70]Streaming Thursday as well, yep.
[190:35.22]But yeah, that'll wrap up tonight.
[190:37.46]Just wanted to get my feet wet on the game.
[190:39.96]This game was heavily requested and it seems very fun.
[190:44.31]We're going to give it a shot.
[190:45.23]But before I go, I do need to say... Hold on.
[190:53.25]A special thanks to Jake from State Farm.
[190:56.29]Thanks for the sub.
[190:57.64]Four Leaf Sunday, Colonel Zero, Callboy for three months.
[191:01.46]Monster Hunter is one of my favorite game series.
[191:03.42]Well, maybe I will become a big fan as well.
[191:09.46]We'll see.
[191:11.09]And I'm sorry that, like, I'm... I, like, learned baptism by fire, and... Sorry about, uh... Me not knowing what the hell I'm doing, but I'm just barely learning this entire series, so... I'll see you tomorrow.
[191:25.72]We will pick up where we left off.
[191:27.43]I might do a couple things off-stream just to get my feet wet a little more.
[191:32.93]But that's going to be it.
[191:34.87]Also, thank you to Endangered Polar Bear, Kirby the Embraced, Patman3780, Kaboosh47, Toast100.

[191:50.56]We'll go longer tomorrow.
