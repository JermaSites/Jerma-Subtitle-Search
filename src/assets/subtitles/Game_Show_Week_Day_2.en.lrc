[08:44.21]It's, yeah, you answer a series of questions.
[08:47.73]100 to a million.
[08:48.95]If you get one question wrong, it's over.
[08:52.54]So I have to get every single question right.
[08:54.64]It goes from very, very easy to very, very hard.
[08:57.48]And you get lifelines, too.
[08:59.14]One of them's phone a friend.
[09:00.07]You can call a friend.
[09:00.87]One of them's ask the audience.
[09:03.84]Which of these terms is used for the most luxurious section of accommodations on an airplane, ship, or train?
[09:10.21]That would be C, first class.
[09:12.65]Easy.

[09:17.43]Thank you, SticksRenegade.
[09:19.23]Got it right.

[09:56.05]It's coattails.
[09:56.69]These are easy.
[09:57.91]Don't need to worry about this shit.
[09:59.77]It's correct.
[10:03.03]It's gonna be good.
[10:04.45]They start off very easy, and then the game pretends to crash.
[10:08.59]The game pretends to crash, but then it doesn't crash.
[10:11.56]So it's all good.
[10:13.39]You've got $200 and a long way to go.
[10:16.29]$200.

[11:41.75]Is it Toadie or Froggy?
[11:44.09]No, it was Toadie.
[11:45.73]I knew it.
[11:45.97]I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[11:49.43]That's the $500 question.

[15:07.28]It's barley.
[15:07.76]You're selecting answer C. Okay.
[15:09.26]Unfortunately, that's not correct.
[15:14.85]Here's the correct answer.
[15:23.25]Well, now that I've made 40 years, maybe you'll have the million.
[15:27.34]Or you could just come back again and play.
[15:31.30]Thanks.
[15:31.62]Who wants to be a millionaire?
[15:33.36]Whoops.
[15:33.74]Third edition.
[15:34.88]No, ask the audience.
[15:36.36]There's a straw poll.
[15:37.31]I thought I had it.
[15:38.09]I thought I had it.
[15:43.10]No, we're gonna play it again.
[15:44.04]And there's nothing I can do about the lag, by the way, because it's like reading off the fucking disc, and I can't do anything about it.
[15:49.24]We're doing it again, but everyone calm down.
[15:52.18]We got all our lifelines back.
[15:54.21]Okay, how many players do we have?
[15:56.49]Got one player, don't worry.
[15:58.19]Hey, how about giving me your name?
[16:02.89]Hey, thanks a lot.
[16:04.32]Now we can get started.
[16:09.82]Oh, well, italics really just did that for nothing, huh?
[16:13.78]Fuck.
[16:16.20]Let me, like, resize this.
[16:17.70]Here we go.
[16:22.45]That's better.
[16:24.37]Alright, first question.
[16:25.91]According to a well-known proverb, one good turn deserves another.
[16:29.61]A better turn, a turn signal, a dollar.
[16:31.93]One good turn deserves another.
[16:33.31]One good turn deserves another.
[16:40.38]If I got the $100 question wrong, I would be very fucking upset.
[16:45.78]I remember this game.
[16:46.52]I got this from a cereal box.
[16:47.90]Yeah.
[16:48.62]Yeah, pretty much.
[16:57.13]I'm using a fixed disc.
[17:00.07]It's just this shitty who wants to be a millionaire.
[17:04.08]So I apologize for like the shitty audio.
[17:06.00]It's just the cereal box who wants to be a millionaire game.
[17:10.74]Alright, $200.
[17:12.28]A cranky person is said to have gotten up on the wrong side of the what?
[17:16.01]Wrong side of the barn?
[17:17.65]Wrong side of the bed?
[17:19.11]Wrong side of the law?
[17:20.03]Or wrong side of the fence?
[17:21.01]Wrong side of the fence.
[17:21.99]Because, you know, when you have a neighbor and you get up and you're angry with your neighbor.
[17:26.16]Wrong side of the fence.
[17:27.54]Got ya.
[17:28.22]Wrong side of the barn.
[17:43.81]What a trickster.
[17:46.70]We have to get to a million dollars, right?
[17:48.62]But there's no way.
[17:50.10]There's no fucking way I'm gonna get to a million dollars.
[17:54.06]I'm gonna try my damnedest, though.
[18:03.35]A person keeping a secret often says, my lips are what?
[18:07.11]Signed, chapped, delivered, or sealed.
[18:10.83]It's sealed, my lips are sealed.
[18:12.23]We don't need to use any lifelines here.
[18:14.75]Why would we need to use a lifeline for that?
[18:18.46]It's very easy.
[18:21.56]Lower the quality for better frames.
[18:23.62]I haven't dropped any frames.
[18:26.74]There is no... Alright, I'm gonna try to say this one more time.
[18:29.68]This is a shitty old 1995 Windows 95 video game.
[18:35.20]It's not my computer, it's not my stream.
[18:37.60]I haven't dropped any frames.
[18:39.50]It's just, like, it's reading off of the disk and it's a piece of crap.
[18:43.56]Don't worry, it's alright.
[18:44.42]Everything's gonna be fine.
[18:47.10]There is no, like, quality setting in, like, here.
[18:51.78]There are no low graphics for here.
[18:56.06]Fortune magazine features articles that primarily focus on what subject?
[19:00.34]Uh, it's business.
[19:02.60]Fortune magazine is business.
[19:05.92]You think answer B will work out for you?
[19:08.32]Cereal box game.
[19:09.16]You are so right.
[19:11.65]Bad disc.
[19:13.39]It's like, yeah, it's reading off like a fake bad disc.
[19:18.25]Use a virtual disc for better frames.
[19:21.05]Well, dude, you know how hard it was for me to figure this shit out?
[19:23.15]You think I'm gonna figure that out?
[19:26.70]It is only this game, though.
[19:28.12]Because there's another game we're going to be playing through 95 emulation that doesn't do this at all.
[19:34.43]Don't worry.
[19:37.98]Just getting warmed up.
[19:43.54]A person who loves someone deeply is said to carry a what for them?
[19:47.19]Carry a torch.
[19:48.39]Carry a match.
[19:49.65]Carry a flashlight.
[19:50.59]Carry a light.
[19:51.15]Carry a torch for them.
[19:53.45]You carry a torch for somebody.
[19:55.61]Alright, we're getting up there.
[20:04.34]We're up to a thousand dollars right now.
[20:07.17]Flashlight.

[44:02.37]In the words of his 1973 song, Bob Dylan is knock, knock, knocking on what door?
[44:08.27]Teacher's door, the green door, heaven's door.
[44:12.41]Knocking on heaven's door.
[44:13.60]See, when Jeremy doesn't fuck around, he gets answers to every question correct without anybody's help.
[44:27.07]Knocking on the rice door.
[44:28.69]That's $1,000.
[44:29.79]This one's worth $2,000.
[44:30.32]Here we go.
[44:30.82]You know, it's kind of funny.
[44:32.32]They got Regis into the studio and he didn't even fucking read these.
[44:34.32]You have to read them yourself.
[44:46.62]Alright, here's the $2,000 question.
[44:47.74]This is where they get hard.
[44:49.42]From 1973 until 1993, Tom Brady... Tom Bradley was the mayor of what major U.S.
[44:55.22]city?

[45:31.76]But I'm going 50-50.
[45:32.26]50-50.
[45:32.36]It's either Los Angeles or Chicago.
[45:34.04]Alright, so it's LA.
[45:35.56]So it's LA.
[45:45.93]It has to be LA, then.
[45:49.39]You think answer B will work out for you?
[45:51.29]It's definitely not San Francisco.
[45:53.98]Yes, you got it right!
[45:55.06]He got it!

[63:43.25]That's good.
[63:43.71]Alright, next question.
[63:45.45]While your opponent is bleeding, let's check out the next question, shall we?
[63:52.14]What could Americans legally do once the 18th Amendment was repealed?
[63:57.04]To give you an edge and to prolong the game, we've furnished a list of potential answers.

[64:07.88]Well, there they are.
[64:08.79]I wish I could help.
[64:09.91]But to be honest, I'm reading these things right.
[64:12.53]That, of course, will be my final answer.
[64:17.11]All righty, then.
[64:17.90]You wouldn't trust me.
[64:19.78]And the right answer is... B!
[64:25.48]You got it!
[64:27.13]All right, now we get to punch this fat guy.
[64:30.27]We've now reached the ultraviolet portion of our show.
[64:35.99]Oh, he's going... Whoa!
[64:45.17]Now he's just slightly surprised.
[64:47.68]That was like George Foreman with mono.
[64:53.87]The only thing this guy has is connected to Trump.
[64:56.94]They just took his name and changed it.
[65:00.00]That's it.
[65:00.58]This guy is not supposed to be Donald Trump.
[65:02.58]Is it Saturn?
[65:03.06]I don't know.
[65:04.06]I don't know.
[65:06.30]I don't know what he did.
[65:08.78]Lifeboats.

[66:15.68]What do you think?
[66:16.24]Oh, no.
[66:16.58]He's only down to $200,000.
[66:17.84]Saturn's named after Kronos.
[66:20.62]Kronos did eat them.
[66:21.98]He ate everyone but Zeus.
[66:42.64]I didn't know that.
[66:46.44]That was me.
[66:52.54]I've got an owie.
[66:58.05]Kill me quicker, I'm still alive.
[66:59.69]Hell is waiting.

[67:34.06]I got it!
[67:35.18]I got it!
[67:35.62]I freaked out and that was the answer.
[67:39.32]Special weapon.
[67:41.35]Oh, and guess what?
[67:43.07]Looks like you've stumbled on a special weapon.
[67:46.01]Well, good for you.
[67:47.34]Let's tell them what they've won.
[67:49.22]It would be my pleasure, Egregious.
[67:51.56]Our lucky player will be using the following special weapon.
[67:56.63]A box of Cuban cigars.
[67:58.23]Okay.
[67:58.90]Two dozen of the finest cigars in the world.
[68:00.78]Oh, he really was.
[68:01.38]All beautifully packed into a solid mahogany box that's designed to give your opponents una problema grande.
[68:07.36]Now I whack him with, like, a pizza box?
[68:10.20]Well, hockey puck, get ready to put the smack in Smackdown.
[68:16.91]Cha-ching!
[68:18.49]100 grain left.
[68:19.51]This is just like Punch-Out!! !
[68:22.07]He only has $50,000 before he, like, dies, apparently.
[68:25.63]That doesn't look like mahogany.
[68:31.86]I'm surprised that person still has vital signs after that throbbing.
[68:35.74]That's right, I said it.
[68:36.84]It was a throbbing.
[68:40.39]Let me, like, turn this down.
[68:43.45]That's better.
[68:44.13]Are you ready for the next question?
[68:46.45]Answer me.
[68:47.43]Good.
[68:47.89]Here it is.
[68:50.27]This is the camp.
[68:51.25]Alright, let's go.
[68:51.61]Profiteering northerners?
[68:52.56]I have no idea.
[68:53.52]I'm going to have to... I don't know.
[69:16.69]I don't know.
[69:18.17]What is the chicken?
[69:19.92]Well, you chose to chicken out.
[69:22.00]Since this question is obviously too hard for you, we will shuffle the deck and choose a brand new one.
[69:27.64]It's always B. But if not, too bad.
[69:30.78]Let's see what your new question will be.
[69:32.60]Oh, God.
[69:34.58]Which children's book has a character named Weenie?
[69:37.84]Weenie.
[69:39.61]Is it A, B, C, or D?
[69:44.29]Uh... The character Weenie.
[69:47.91]I don't fucking know, dude.
[69:49.33]Weenie?
[69:53.30]I have no idea.
[69:54.46]I have no idea.
[69:55.66]I'm gonna say Charlotte's Web.
[69:58.32]I think, like, the pig is... That's the pig's name, right?
[70:02.58]Okay, let's see.
[70:05.12]You chose answer A. The right answer is...
[70:08.98]I'm pretty sure it's the pig.
[70:11.50]Fuck!
[70:11.90]What happens when you lose in this game?
[70:13.90]Oh, Wilbur, goddammit, yeah.
[70:36.52]I gotta do this again.
[70:38.54]I'm gonna do this again.
[70:44.08]This time I know what the lifelines are.
[70:48.38]This is summoning Satan from the ninth circle of hell.
[70:50.70]Hey, my favorite pig, Weenie.
[70:53.00]All right, let's keep going.
[70:54.74]Let's go to like, let's go to Melvin.
[70:57.80]With a push of a button and a click of a mouse, our next contestant rose from the depths of Silicon Valley to the head of the world's most powerful computer corporation.
[71:07.87]And all without ever having once seen the sun.
[71:12.71]Okay, so this is supposed to be like, this is supposed to be like an entrepreneur or something, whatever.
[71:17.84]Alright, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's win.
[71:21.26]We won Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
[71:22.94]I got to like $64,000.
[71:23.96]That's how you win that game.
[71:25.44]Nobody fucking wins that game.
[71:31.27]White lifting.
[71:31.81]This is so unbearable.
[71:32.60]Beethoven was deaf.
[71:33.88]He's dead.
[71:34.54]By the time Beethoven composed his final symphony, he was dead.
[71:37.30]Wait a minute, maybe, I think he actually was dead.
[72:01.89]Because it didn't come out till after he died.
[72:03.33]No, okay, good.
[72:04.61]What a fucking childish game.
[72:08.93]What a childish game.
[72:25.50]He had more than five symphonies.
[72:27.38]I want to see what happens when you win.
[72:30.61]Do you, like, kill these people?
[72:35.73]How would he compose if he was dead?
[72:37.31]Like, his son put it together.
[72:38.21]I don't know.
[72:38.89]Andy Warhol.
[72:49.99]Is it A, B, C, or D?
[72:55.21]I can't say I'm happy about this, like, freak out.
[72:58.49]This, like, insane freak out that he does when you press a button.
[73:04.42]Soup can, yeah.
[73:09.04]It's a soup can.
[73:10.64]What a genius.
[73:22.02]Alright, do you think anybody that worked on this game would ever imagine that this would be streamed on Twitch TV?
[73:29.23]I can't believe it.
[73:30.45]If I was like a person that was like a character artist on this game and I'm like 75 years old right now.
[73:36.90]This is like on Twitch right now.
[73:38.58]I would have never thought that would be possible.
[73:41.54]It's time for the next question.
[73:46.20]On what TV show did Janet Jackson debut?
[73:49.32]When did Janet Jackson debut?
[73:51.00]Is it A, B, C, or D?
[73:54.11]Fuck.
[73:54.97]There they are.
[73:55.89]I wish I could help.
[73:56.89]I don't know.
[73:58.31]I'm reading these things back.
[73:59.45]I'm too old.
[74:00.03]I was not old enough for this.
[74:01.63]I'm going to have to say... What is F?
[74:02.95]Time for the magic fortune cookie.
[74:16.11]After selecting your answer, we'll break open the fortune cookie and see what it says.
[74:20.87]Then you can choose a new answer or stay with the one that you've chosen.
[74:24.93]Okay, well, it's definitely... I don't know.
[74:27.23]D, maybe?
[74:27.71]I don't know.
[74:29.51]Let's see.
[74:34.97]B?
[74:35.03]I have no idea.
[74:35.57]We can reconsider.
[74:35.99]So it's... B?
[74:36.25]I don't know.
[74:46.10]It's either A, B, C, or let's go with B. Alright, playtime is over.
[74:49.52]B. I don't know.
[74:52.18]Is it just always fucking B?
[74:56.50]And the right answer is... It still says who wants to be a millionaire?
[75:04.12]B!
[75:05.03]You got it right!
[75:05.61]I thought I changed it.
[75:06.49]It should say who wants to beat up a millionaire.
[75:10.93]Well, generic contestant, go ahead and make your day.
[75:17.27]He lost a tooth I think he lost a tooth that means we're doing well Why is Fred Flintstone in this game look over the host shoulder on the left oh?
[75:39.13]Holy shit, there really is, like, a Fred Flintstone.
[75:43.03]I think that's just a kind of Hawaiian shirt, though.
[75:44.65]I don't think that's actually Fred Flintstone.
[75:45.75]Who received four write-in votes in a Boise, Idaho mayoral election?
[75:51.93]Who received four write-in votes in a Boise, Idaho... Is it A, B, C, or D?
[75:57.35]It's gotta be Mr. Potato Head, right?
[76:00.75]None of these are, like, funny.
[76:03.04]It's gotta be Mr. Potato Head.
[76:06.99]Because all these are like actual... I'm just gonna straight up say Mr. Potato Head.
[76:13.73]What the fuck was that?
[76:31.70]Wow.
[76:32.54]Lucky, lucky you.
[76:34.33]Let's see what you've won.
[76:35.97]He's just like choking on himself.
[76:37.37]Our lucky player will be using the following special weapon.
[76:40.57]Ooh.
[76:42.19]A federal injunction.
[76:43.57]This carefully worded document can single-handedly reverse effects of supply and demand while packing one hell of a wallop to boot.
[76:51.69]That is some real... That is some real statire.
[76:56.01]That's some real commentary here.
[77:01.67]Well... Uh... If you guys want a profile picture... There's a pretty good one on the screen right here.
[77:15.31]If I can get the Federal Injunction to move, that's a profile picture.
[77:18.15]That's a Steam profile picture.
[77:24.19]He's almost done.
[77:25.29]I still got two lifelines.
[77:31.11]Who was the first host of the Tonight Show?
[77:33.31]The first host of the Tonight Show?
[77:34.29]Wasn't me.
[77:34.51]That's a different story, though.
[77:35.65]I'm just saying.
[77:36.61]Was... Is it A, B, C, or D?
[77:40.27]Ah, fuck.
[77:41.95]I don't think it was Johnny Carson.
[77:43.59]I don't think it was Johnny Carson.
[77:48.61]It wasn't Johnny Carson.
[77:49.73]He did it for a long time.
[77:51.37]Was it Johnny Carson?
[77:52.27]I don't fucking remember.
[77:56.43]Was it Carson?
[77:56.88]Like, was he the first one?
[77:57.68]I don't think it was him.
[77:58.66]I really don't.
[77:59.06]But, I mean, it makes sense if he was.
[78:00.54]I think it was Jackpar.
[78:15.43]Okay, shout ahead.
[78:17.11]You didn't do too bad.
[78:18.53]Although hardly what you'd call a stellar performance.
[78:21.59]You know, I bet you hear that a lot.
[78:24.64]Well, that was exciting.
[78:26.04]But whether you won or lost isn't really important.
[78:28.50]What's important is that I make roughly $3,000 for every word I read.
[78:34.54]There, I just raked in $90,000.
[78:36.22]And that was another $18,000.
[78:37.64]I'm playing you trying to power off the machine.
[78:43.11]Okay.
[78:47.75]Yes, I'm trying to power off the machine.
[78:51.47]Alright, we're going to move on.
[78:54.27]We'll move on to some more Family Feud.
[79:06.08]So, I didn't get a chance to do the thing I wanted to do, but it's okay.
[79:10.82]We're still going to play Family Feud.
[79:20.45]Oh, hold on.
[79:21.61]My bad.
[79:24.43]We'll play Family Feud for, like, maybe just about an hour.
[79:33.09]I wanted to get the picture, but I didn't get it in time, so... The bumps or the bumps?
[79:39.90]No, actually, it don't matter who we play as.
[79:43.62]Did I make... I didn't have a chance to make the custom characters.
[79:46.06]I was not here.
[79:50.33]I didn't make the custom characters.
[79:51.77]I didn't have a chance.
[79:56.01]And speaking of which, speaking of chances, speaking of like discs, where the fuck is the disc?
[80:01.04]There it is.
[80:07.60]Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, and Peggy.
[80:10.93]Let me just see how much of a pain in the ass it'll be.
[80:14.09]Give me one second.
[80:14.97]I'll be right back.
[80:15.73]I'm going to see how long this would take if I were to do it just while we chill and talk.
[80:19.37]Let's just see.
[80:20.60]Give me one minute.
[82:32.40]Okay, we can try this.
[82:34.69]We'll see, uh, we'll see if this one works.
[82:37.13]We'll give it a go.
[82:40.15]And let me open this.
[82:41.99]There's Family Feud.
[82:46.68]The Feud!
[82:47.22]Uh, hold on.
[82:58.38]Okie dokie, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[83:00.29]Oh god, please.
[83:04.33]This is why... This is what annoys me about the world.
[83:08.82]This is what annoys me about the world.
[83:10.20]Okay.
[83:13.48]Go.
[83:17.44]Yeah?
[83:18.00]Are you there?
[83:18.62]Can you see it?
[83:21.78]Okay, hold on.
[83:24.10]Family Feud appears to be broken.
[83:26.88]Can Family Feud even open?
[83:29.22]I wonder.
[83:29.60]Let's stay tuned and see.
[83:32.77]Okay, it opened now.
[83:34.87]Don't ask me what the fuck that was.
[83:38.99]Okay, hold on.
[83:39.31]Um, so what is going on here?
[83:40.07]I'm gonna have to do this again.
[83:40.85]Well, hold on.
[83:41.23]Let me move this thing over here.
[84:05.33]Load of shit if you ask me Put the monitor capture here.
[84:10.73]There it is.
[84:11.49]Hello.
[84:12.47]Well, you can see my monitor.
[84:14.35]Yes, you can good Hopefully you can see this Except it's fucking tiny.
[84:21.96]All right, so I need to go like this Like last time because there is no possible way to get this to work correctly I
[84:34.47]It is literally, there's no possible way to get this to work.
[84:37.47]I've tried every single possible avenue.
[84:40.27]Every single one.
[84:41.97]So, sorry.
[84:43.43]You're gonna have to deal with the sides of the screen being a piece of shit.
[84:50.38]I wish I could do this.
[84:57.10]Mm-hmm.
[85:01.90]Bear with me here for a second.
[85:03.81]Okay.
[85:04.68]There we go.
[85:07.33]So, let's see if this works.
[85:09.65]Make a new family?
[85:10.91]Or you can make changes to one that you've already saved.
[85:13.73]Click on whatever you'd like to change.
[85:15.31]Okay.
[85:17.03]First off, you'll need to write in a name for your character.
[85:20.38]Have some... Oh, fuck.
[85:23.52]Have some... Where did that come from?
[85:27.24]okay fun changing any options you'd like if you want to use a photo of your own yes I do want to use a photo we'll minimize the game so you can search for the file oh god now what happened dude this is what happens when you work with like this is one of you and you work with like the 200 year old panda at the zoo
[85:50.92]Every single possible problem, it doesn't matter what it is, every single problem will happen if you play a game that's 20 fucking years old.
[85:57.44]There was a huge... I can't do it.
[85:58.10]This is not gonna work.
[85:58.73]The game crashes literally every single time.
[86:00.45]I cannot... I can't keep the game open.
[86:12.53]So, I cannot physically keep the game open because when it minimizes, the game just crashes.
[86:18.05]There you go.
[86:18.71]Nothing I can do.
[86:19.67]I'm just gonna play.
[86:21.73]Let's just fucking play.
[86:25.66]That's what happens when you try to run a fucking 20-year-old game on Windows 7.
[86:34.84]We're gonna go back to the bump.
[86:38.22]Alright, let's go.
[86:39.96]Bring back fucking Louie Anderson.
[86:41.00]Our first family hails from Boston, and they describe themselves as off the wall and sober.
[86:47.61]A feud machine.
[86:48.43]Let's hear it for them.
[86:49.99]Family number one.
[86:53.51]I'm so sad.
[86:55.29]I'm going to try to get it to work.
[86:56.55]It just wasn't here yesterday.
[86:58.31]I was barely at the house.
[87:00.25]Game crashes suggest another game that crashes.
[87:05.46]These two families will be going head to head on the family feud.
[87:10.77]Have you tried running a compatibility mode?
[87:13.85]I spent, like, 27 hours trying to get all these games to work.
[87:20.05]And, yes, I've tried.
[87:21.21]I literally was running those other games in an emulated Windows 95 environment.
[87:25.09]Let's have some good old-fashioned family fun.
[87:27.21]Good luck, everybody.
[87:28.09]At least he feels like that.
[87:32.57]At least I can see his face and laugh.
[87:36.57]We're looking for the most popular answer.
[87:39.88]Name something that has a... Bag.
[87:41.02]Bag.
[87:41.71]Bag.
[87:41.89]Bag.

[87:45.25]Bag.
[87:46.17]Bag.
[87:46.35]Bag.
[87:46.61]Bag.
[88:10.18]Good answer.
[88:11.44]Good answer.
[88:13.98]A bag has a fucking flap.
[88:15.64]You lift it up and it's at the inside of the bag.
[88:17.88]And they're gonna play it.
[88:21.77]Okay.
[88:22.23]Gonna play?
[88:23.09]Let's go.
[88:23.57]Name something that has a flap.
[88:30.81]Come on, guys.
[88:31.27]PG-13.
[88:31.51]Okay.
[88:31.61]Give me the answer.
[88:37.26]How does a game get made this way?
[88:41.00]It does.
[88:41.78]Somehow.
[88:45.46]Next family member.
[88:46.62]What do you say?
[88:47.92]Name something that has a flap.
[88:49.86]An airplane.
[88:54.22]A long... Long underwear has a flap.
[88:58.87]Okay.
[88:59.95]Easy answer.
[89:01.23]I mean, it's true, but... What?
[89:04.49]Who's walking around in, like, shitty long underwear?
[89:08.75]That's right.
[89:12.08]Another player over there.
[89:13.42]Yeah, maybe my, like, grandfather does that.
[89:15.19]Name something that has a flap.
[89:17.21]Like, I picture, like, a 95-year-old man.
[89:19.59]A doggy?
[89:21.37]Doggy door.
[89:21.99]Survey set.
[89:22.23]I don't remember what answer it would even be.
[89:30.34]What has a flap?
[89:32.98]A truck?
[89:33.82]Next family.
[89:34.76]One more strike, and you get a chance to steal.
[89:38.56]This game is just a fever dream.
[89:40.36]Name something that has a flap.
[89:44.40]What?
[89:45.04]I don't know.
[89:45.42]What has a flap?
[89:46.16]Okay.
[89:47.12]Give me the answer.
[89:49.50]What did he just write?
[89:51.14]I didn't even see what he wrote.
[89:55.46]Oh, good answer, but sorry.
[89:57.14]What the fuck?
[89:57.70]What did he just write?
[90:00.52]Your answer, family number one.
[90:02.28]All right.
[90:03.30]Flap.
[90:04.12]Number one answer is still there.
[90:05.30]Flap.
[90:07.94]A purse?
[90:08.22]I don't know.
[90:08.98]A hat?
[90:09.66]I got it.
[90:11.44]It's a purse.
[90:12.68]So what the hell?
[90:13.54]What's number one?
[90:14.88]It's number one by a huge amount, too.
[90:21.69]What was the number one response?
[90:34.20]An envelope.
[90:35.70]Oh, my God.
[90:37.48]And a car truck.
[90:38.30]Yeah, see, like a truck.
[90:40.34]Was it a truck or a purse?
[90:43.61]No airplane is on that list.
[90:47.65]Number one is Bird.
[90:48.49]That brings us to the end of the first round.
[90:50.73]Let's look at the scores.
[90:54.90]Family number one, you're playing great.
[90:56.56]I want 32 points for that?
[90:57.16]That's kind of bullshit.
[90:57.64]Family number two, you're not far off the lead.

[108:42.77]Okay, I can't all tabbing is so dangerous All tabbing could just break everything and like I can't see to the right let's go the other screen is fucked up there from Kim is not Full screen I don't the people that are just coming in that have no idea this game can't run in a full screen.
[109:05.98]I
[109:13.90]I can't explain that as many times as I possibly can.
[109:16.80]Getting this game to run took like all fucking day a few days ago.
[109:22.26]This game doesn't run in full screen.
[109:23.88]If it runs in full screen, I can't stream it.
[109:26.76]It takes over my whole computer and will crash the game.
[109:29.51]It will crash my whole computer.
[109:30.91]It's not going to happen.
[109:34.39]It has to be played like this or it can't be played at all.
[109:37.53]I've got the questions.
[109:38.61]You've got the answers.
[109:39.73]Let's have some fun.
[109:44.58]Oh no, not this game, I guess.
[109:45.70]Go full screen.
[109:46.08]It's not gonna work.
[109:46.82]That is a taxi driver.
[109:47.86]Taxi.
[109:48.14]Thank you.
[109:50.24]Yeah, it's almost as if CD-ROM games didn't have 16x9 in mind when they were made.
[109:53.41]I know, right?
[109:53.85]But apparently I'm a shit stain if I don't have it in full screen.
[110:14.23]Alright, uh, method of transportation.
[110:18.61]Submarine?
[110:20.31]What are you talking about?
[110:28.31]Yeah, maybe if you're in the Navy, you have a guy that fucking drives it for you.
[110:33.09]Are you serious?
[110:34.16]Submarine?
[110:36.52]Let's go.
[110:44.26]That is out-fucking-raging.
[110:46.61]I guess that, you know, that's true.
[110:49.69]That is true, but that doesn't make any sense.
[110:54.21]A limo.
[110:54.95]Number one.
[110:56.81]Wow.
[110:58.49]Uh, taxi, bus, plane, school bus.
[111:03.96]Another player.
[111:04.92]We need another answer.
[111:06.44]Tell me a method of transportation in which someone else does the driving.
[111:10.30]Uh-uh.
[111:10.76]Bus.
[111:11.10]All right.
[111:12.00]Show me.
[111:12.88]Good answer.
[111:14.05]Bus.
[111:15.13]One.
[111:15.63]And the last one's probably plane.
[111:20.63]Good answer.
[111:21.11]Number one.
[111:21.43]Airplane, train.
[111:22.41]We'll go with airplane.
[111:23.97]Another player.
[111:24.67]Okay.
[111:25.53]Got an answer for us?
[111:26.67]Tell me a method of transportation in which someone else does the driving.
[111:29.81]Soaked teeth.
[111:32.83]Is it there?
[111:37.82]Flawless, come on.
[111:38.40]It's alright, train.
[111:40.64]You don't drive a plane?
[111:42.24]Yeah, you do.
[111:42.64]You drive a plane.
[111:43.50]You drive a plane, you fly a plane, but you drive a plane too.
[111:46.16]Train.
[111:46.28]There it is.
[112:01.12]Uh, so I think maybe the AI... The AI, I think, was trying to say Subway and said Submarine.
[112:09.61]I think that guy's just a fucking brainless idiot.
[112:13.43]Subway is the right answer.
[112:14.41]He wrote Submarine.
[112:15.59]I think his AI got programmed wrong.
[112:17.26]To add the Marine part.
[112:19.78]Was the AI this stupid last time we played?
[112:24.58]I don't remember that.
[112:25.92]Family number two, you're not far off the lead.
[112:30.89]I feel like when we played this a couple days ago, it was not this ridiculous.
[112:36.07]I feel like they were smarter.
[112:37.05]It's just lines of code.
[112:38.53]It just says random shit.
[112:40.13]A business that makes money from other people's tragedies.
[112:43.97]A lawyer.
[112:44.25]A lawyer.
[112:58.88]I spelt it.
[112:59.48]I spelt it wrong.
[113:01.76]I can't spell people.
[113:03.30]I can't spell things right.
[113:04.44]I got it.
[113:05.70]A lawyer.
[113:09.27]Good answer, but there's one that can beat it.
[113:11.47]Next family.
[113:14.15]Funeral.
[113:15.07]Lawyer.
[113:17.69]Bankers.
[113:18.41]I hope it's up there for you.
[113:21.59]Bankers.
[113:22.61]Bankers.
[113:24.73]I'm passing this, by the way.
[113:25.61]But it's not up there.
[113:28.65]Pass it.
[113:31.71]These people can't do shit.
[113:33.37]It's funeral lawyer, the only two I can really think of.
[113:38.62]Or like doctor.
[113:40.38]Insurance, I don't know.
[113:43.66]Pun shop.
[113:45.90]Very specific good answer, but I don't think that's correct.
[113:48.22]I don't think that's going to be right.
[113:49.22]She just punched herself.
[113:54.32]This woman just hit herself.
[113:57.42]Calm down there.
[113:58.04]Towing service?
[113:58.76]No.
[113:59.20]It's not going to be towing service.
[114:01.96]I have to steal though.
[114:03.03]So I'm going to say hospital?
[114:06.89]Doctor?
[114:07.21]I'm going to say doctor.
[114:25.52]Another player.
[114:26.48]We need another answer.
[114:27.92]Carl Sundell.
[114:28.42]Tell me a kind of business that makes money from other people's tragedies.
[114:32.16]Monuments.
[114:33.98]Okay.
[114:36.04]That is so meta and specific.
[114:38.35]It's true.
[114:39.31]Like, meta-wise.
[114:41.71]It's not there.
[114:42.53]That is deep.
[114:44.39]Yes.
[114:45.21]Yes, when, like, Ulysses S. Grant, like, fucking died.
[114:48.49]When, like, George Washington died.
[114:50.07]Hold on.
[114:51.05]I'll make that point in a minute.
[114:53.22]Got an answer?
[114:54.76]Like, when, like, George Washington died, there was, like, a tragedy.
[114:58.32]And, like, yes, the guy that made the fucking money... What?
[115:00.06]Dub, it's the same damn thing.
[115:01.22]News media.
[115:01.46]Whatever.
[115:01.70]But my point is, when you say that monuments are working off a tragedy...
[115:24.36]Like, you're talking about the guy that made the statue of George Washington after George Washington died like a hundred years ago.
[115:29.84]Sorry, they only got 20 points.
[115:30.54]Doctor is not a business.
[115:34.14]Yeah, it's a doctor.
[115:34.70]Well, that guy wrote Monument, so come on, give me some slack.
[115:36.19]That dude wrote Monument.
[115:37.27]Good luck.
[115:55.12]Name a place where people daydream.

[125:49.23]This is a very bad idea.
[125:50.37]Which plays Family Feud?
[126:06.17]I still can't get over how terrible it is that they laugh at Sober.
[126:09.67]That's so bad.

[126:35.34]Welcome to another game of Family Feud, everyone.

[127:29.98]Achoo.
[127:35.05]Who thought to give a sneeze animation?
[127:38.19]That doesn't need to be there.
[127:39.27]That just gave somebody extra work at this developing place.
[127:43.50]You know, give them sneezes.
[127:48.80]Do we really have to do that?
[127:56.53]Yes!
[127:59.96]Next, tell me.
[128:02.72]Uh, guys, you guys are writing words.
[128:08.32]I'm not playing right now.
[128:10.02]We lost because I wrote chocolate.
[128:11.83]Because that was the first word that I saw.
[128:13.19]And now we're at the mercy of the AI.
[128:16.03]So you guys are giving the AI words, but they can't read because they're a computer program.
[128:20.27]They can't speak English.

[129:24.63]How is the AI getting all these answers?
[129:27.77]You know what?
[129:28.45]Because this is the random items list.
[129:30.85]This AI just says random words and these random food items actually is working for them.
[129:38.42]Because that's what they say every time anyways.
[129:42.94]What the fuck is a TV dinner?
[129:50.15]TV dinner is a microwavable meal that got popular like 40 or 50 years ago.

[130:48.29]Okay, here we go.
[130:49.11]I'm going to see my first answer.

[131:00.54]You're in the lead, family number two.
[131:02.02]Sorry, we can get this back.
[131:02.98]You're within striking distance.
[131:05.46]So, here we go.
[131:06.62]It's round two.

[131:32.43]Let's see what's on the board.
[131:35.67]It's gotta be broke.
[131:36.53]Come on.
[131:39.01]I'm sorry, but it's not one of our topics.
[131:40.69]Oh, I just, like, cut my eyelid with my finger.

[131:58.17]So... Good answer.
[132:00.65]Number one.
[132:01.25]Family number two.
[132:03.39]Are you going to play or pass?
[132:09.69]You're playing?
[132:10.55]Okay.
[132:11.91]This whole game is going to be the AI.
[132:13.63]I know it is.
[132:14.31]Another player.
[132:14.97]Okay.
[132:15.71]Got an answer for us?
[132:16.81]Name a product people buy for its firm support.
[132:19.61]I hope you guys watch the AI play Family Feud while we laugh at the things they say.
[132:30.91]That's what we're doing right now.
[132:34.20]Next player.
[132:35.16]What's your guess?
[132:36.72]Name a product people buy for its firm support.
[132:48.21]They really are using the chat.
[132:50.77]They really are using the chat.

[132:55.89]Get ready to steal.
[132:56.73]Next player.

[133:21.26]General Electric GE?
[133:22.52]What do you think it is, family number one?
[133:24.16]They are fucking reading the chat.
[133:26.76]A bra!
[133:28.02]Let's win one for crying out loud.
[133:29.96]You got the point.
[133:43.61]What was in third place?
[133:46.31]Let's see what was in fourth.
[133:47.93]Underwear.
[133:51.10]Man.
[133:52.30]I honestly was not expecting to see the word tomato pop up there.
[133:55.30]Not a fucking chance.
[133:56.52]Unless one of you guys made me write it.
[133:58.64]Do we flip?
[133:59.48]Am I the AI and is that me?
[134:00.84]Jesus.
[134:01.00]God.
[134:01.10]Ugh.
[134:11.39]Long pause, correct answer.
[134:13.45]Chat family is too good.
[134:17.82]Name the crime you think most people are arrested for.
[134:19.86]It's, uh, I mean... I have to start it, okay?
[134:21.26]Because it's like, honestly, it's drugs.
[134:22.46]I have to start it, and then I can take a look.
[134:45.39]Very good.
[134:46.25]But there's two up there that can beat it.
[134:48.21]Next family gets a chance.
[134:49.97]No, I'm looking.
[134:52.72]Nobody gets arrested for loitering.
[134:56.68]Come on, we need an answer.
[134:57.82]Breaking and entering.
[135:01.46]Let's see if it's up there.
[135:03.19]No, you lose.
[135:06.89]Good guess, but it's not up there.
[135:08.51]I kind of want to let him play and just dig himself in.
[135:11.29]Are you going to play or pass?
[135:13.05]Let's...
[135:15.71]Let's let them dig their own grave.
[135:17.40]They're seriously, like, so bad.
[135:18.76]They're going to lose every time.
[135:21.24]They're using the N symbol.
[135:22.94]That's, like, how stupid the AI really is.
[135:29.47]Okay, good.
[135:30.01]Murder.
[135:30.89]God bless you, by the way.
[135:31.83]What?
[135:35.69]Wow.
[135:35.97]Murder is not up there.
[135:40.19]Next family member, what do you say?
[135:42.73]Let Twitch play.
[135:43.67]We will.

[135:49.43]I already did that.
[135:50.27]Drugs.
[135:51.93]Not up there.
[135:55.84]I thought it would be there.
[135:56.94]Sorry.
[135:57.58]That's two strikes.
[135:58.80]Twitch watches family feud.
[136:00.52]Next family.
[136:01.44]One more strike and you get a chance to steal.
[136:05.15]Next player.

[136:07.71]Name the crime you think most people are arrested for.
[136:14.66]Let's see if it's up there.
[136:17.92]Twitch is already playing.
[136:19.10]That's it.
[136:28.27]Don't be lewd.
[136:29.27]Yeah, I'm not going to use any lewd answers.

[139:27.87]The three, like, weird people that have the birds in their house.
[139:30.89]Fish, snake, rabbit, bird.
[139:45.44]Birds are great.
[139:46.12]I'm just kidding.
[139:46.86]It was a joke.
[139:47.72]I'm kidding.
[139:48.26]I used to have a bird when I was a little kid.
[139:50.66]I didn't have a bird.
[139:51.24]I'm lying to you.
[139:51.96]Well, let's see how they do.
[139:53.69]Let's see how the computer does.
[139:54.51]The computer's destroyed.
[139:55.19]I had two birds.
[139:55.51]Wait, we don't get to watch them?
[139:58.51]Oh, we don't.
[140:12.27]Hi, folks.
[140:12.79]Two choices for you here.
[140:14.59]Go backstage.
[140:15.45]Fair enough.
[140:18.17]Backstage.
[140:19.19]All right.
[140:20.18]Pick your band.
[140:21.16]No more messing around.
[140:23.70]We also need to do a couple of updates.
[140:24.90]Okay, backstage.
[140:26.50]Start off.
[140:27.12]How many families are playing?
[140:29.28]Pick your family.
[140:29.94]We don't even get to dance either.
[140:31.54]Family one, you have the space bar.
[140:34.56]All right, let's go.
[140:35.54]Oh, shit, hold on.
[140:37.46]We're not going yet.
[140:39.49]I need to update this.
[140:43.46]It still says we're playing Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire.
[140:45.44]That's not true.
[140:46.06]It's going to make the bumps return.
[140:51.17]There we go.
[141:01.21]And also important.
[141:04.59]Let me read some bits while we start this off.
[141:10.58]Let me see.
[141:11.66]Make sure I start back here.
[141:15.46]I missed a lot.
[141:16.17]I'm a fucking terrible streamer, guys.
[141:17.67]I'm sorry.
[141:19.29]I will get to the ones that were before this in a few minutes.
[141:22.36]But let me read these ones first.
[141:25.02]Oh no, we're going to have a permanent mouse.
[141:32.11]We're going to have a permanent mouse.
[141:35.19]Sorry, there's nothing I can do about that.
[141:36.81]It's just permanently going to be there.
[141:38.69]That's going to make everybody have so much anxiety.
[141:41.48]No, I can't.
[141:43.12]I can't.
[141:43.96]I have to restart it.
[141:44.76]I can't do that.
[141:46.96]I literally am going to cause you guys so much stress.
[141:49.18]It causes me stress, so we're not doing that.
[141:55.83]Anyways.
[141:57.85]Let's move this.
[142:02.27]Okay, so.
[142:03.71]God damn it.
[142:08.28]Give me a fucking... Come on.
[142:10.26]Stop doing this.
[142:20.27]Come on.
[142:23.91]Okay.
[142:26.16]You guys can see, right?
[142:28.02]Hi, welcome to the Family Feud.
[142:29.53]Ah, hi.
[142:32.05]It just messes me up.
[142:33.73]I thank you, A Wild Marrow, for the $5.
[142:36.33]Somebody I can't even... It used to happen when I alt-tap and I'm trying.
[142:39.32]Let's start back here.
[142:42.20]Emperor William, thank you for the $5.
[142:45.94]Be honest, you paid somebody to make this game for you.
[142:48.88]I wish.
[142:49.80]Thank you, Emperor, for the $5.
[142:51.92]Cigarette Spaghetti, again with $10.
[142:54.67]I'm going to go ahead and need you to open that picture of your face.
[142:59.72]I will.
[143:01.22]Thanks for the $10.
[143:03.48]Mr. Sneakman, also thanks for the $10.
[143:04.82]Hey, Jeremy, if you want more ideas for Western League, you can play Fallout New Vegas multiplayer.
[143:09.54]Then just use cowboy weapons.
[143:10.74]That would be kind of fun.
[143:12.98]You're right.
[143:15.04]We'll see.
[143:16.37]Thank you also to Matters of Darkness for the... We skipped that before.
[143:22.41]I didn't know there was a fucking explosion.
[143:24.70]This is the official German 985.
[143:25.94]Better future.
[143:26.54]Better future, apparently.
[143:27.38]Somebody gave $2.20.
[143:28.00]I just can't see it because my fucking brain is being covered.
[143:32.91]But thank you.
[143:33.43]The screen's black.
[143:34.25]Wait, you guys can't see this?
[143:35.05]Can you guys not see the screen?
[143:36.33]Let's see.
[143:36.77]Yes.
[143:54.39]83.
[143:57.23]Good answer.
[143:57.89]Number one.
[144:02.45]Play RDR on Cowboy Week.
[144:04.01]Red Dead Redemption.
[144:07.11]I thought for a second you were saying DDR.
[144:09.13]All right, then.
[144:10.79]I was like, why would I play Red Revolution Dance Revolution?
[144:21.01]storms okay what a perfect answer for these idiots that was very very smart you got it play dance dance redemption yeah another player we need another answer besides babies name something else that is given a human name red dance revolution there it is let's see if it's up there yeah I'm gonna
[144:51.08]I'm gonna play American Idol tomorrow.
[144:53.88]Tomorrow's American Idol.
[144:56.00]By the way, let's be very clear about something.
[144:58.30]American Idol, the video game that I have, sucks.
[145:02.12]It's not good.
[145:03.52]But we're gonna play it tomorrow.
[145:06.46]I will at least show you guys how not fun it is.
[145:18.33]Family number one, one more strike and you get a chance to steal.
[145:21.87]Next family member, what do you say?
[145:26.97]Besides babies, name something else that is given a human name.
[145:29.91]Sounds like the perfect, no, it's not even, it's not good.
[145:32.19]It's awful.
[145:32.95]Answer, please.
[145:34.03]Cars are given human names.
[145:43.07]I guess there are some, like, random fucking weirdos.
[145:48.93]Uh, this is my car, Sally.
[145:51.04]Yes, I'm still streaming in the morning.
[145:52.56]Because I'm getting on an airplane tomorrow, uh, afternoon.
[145:58.02]Tomorrow... Actually, I actually don't even know.
[145:59.96]Boats?
[146:01.54]What the fuck are they doing this whole thing?
[146:04.60]Yeah, I'm getting on a plane tomorrow.
[146:06.98]I actually have no idea when it is.
[146:09.20]But I know it's like later on in the evening.
[146:12.53]Or afternoon.
[146:13.83]But I'll be streaming tomorrow morning.
[146:19.69]So, expect a very short stream tomorrow, because I, like, I literally, I thought today was going to be a short stream, but we're going for, like, a few hours here.
[146:29.29]This is shocking.
[146:32.01]Tomorrow's going to be very short.
[146:33.43]Tomorrow's going to be, like, less than two hours, because I have to get on a plane.
[146:37.83]So, early stream, early short stream tomorrow.
[146:40.91]So, I'm probably around, I'm going to say, like, probably 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning.
[146:43.53]Eastern.
[146:45.91]Is what I would probably assume.
[146:46.85]Hair.
[146:47.39]You just got like a bunch of fucking hair everywhere.
[146:57.36]Hair.
[146:58.82]Yep.
[147:00.34]Got it.
[147:02.10]I am not going to California.
[147:03.97]As much as I love California, I'm not going there unfortunately.
[147:06.79]Sputnik.
[147:09.63]Only get on a plane if it has a human name.
[147:11.67]Yeah.
[147:13.99]Litterbox.
[147:14.51]That makes sense.
[147:16.61]Good answer.
[147:17.17]There's like one smart person on their team.
[147:19.65]And that's... Okay.

[166:04.19]Let's do it.
[166:04.85]A hundred people surveyed.
[166:06.89]Top three answers up on the board.

[166:08.97]We're looking for the most popular answer.

[166:45.81]Somebody just said something really mean about Louis Anderson.
[166:48.85]It's just gonna be shaving shit.
[167:04.63]It's going to be shaving cream, razor, and like... Aftershave.
[167:08.34]Aftershave.
[167:08.86]I win.
[167:09.16]Men shave, don't they?
[167:10.32]That's it.
[167:10.62]I win.
[167:10.80]That was a 1-2-3 clean sweep.
[167:11.60]Game over.
[167:11.86]Hey, what do you know?
[167:13.90]Men shave.
[167:14.32]Don't you know that, folks?
[167:41.88]Wait, you guys don't know what aftershave is?
[167:46.87]Aftershave.
[167:47.51]That's a good term.
[167:48.57]It's time for round four.
[167:55.40]Stop making fun of Louie Addison.
[168:00.52]Louie, blink twice if you need to.
[168:05.54]You know the drill.
[168:06.31]A hundred people did the survey.
[168:08.09]Top five answers up on the board.
[168:10.55]Good luck.
[168:12.59]Name something that people use to pick a log.
[168:15.16]Family number one.
[168:17.00]A corkscrew.
[168:19.54]No, no, not a corkscrew.
[168:20.76]What is that thing called?
[168:21.56]A paper clip.
[168:22.10]Is it there?
[168:22.52]What?
[168:24.28]People use a paper clip.
[168:26.22]Oh, man.
[168:27.00]Oh, well.
[168:31.62]Oh.
[168:43.83]Okay, well we both can't do it so we're getting a new question.
[168:50.17]Oh well.
[168:50.39]I think you might be insane.
[168:51.18]Parents.
[168:51.76]Parents.
[169:15.13]I hope it's there for you.
[169:16.51]Okay, show me.
[169:18.81]Parents.
[169:19.81]Parents.
[169:23.01]Somebody just pushed on his stomach when he said that, by the way.
[169:25.69]He was asleep, and they put the mic right in his face, and they were like, Louie, what's something that little kids tell white lies do?
[169:31.33]And they pushed on his stomach, and he came out with parents.
[169:36.11]I love how I just had to say that joke so fast because I didn't want to get talked over by Louis Anderson.
[169:41.48]Teacher.
[169:41.66]Teacher.
[169:41.90]Yes!
[170:00.55]Another player.
[170:01.51]We need another answer.
[170:02.57]They tell lies, too.
[170:04.19]Kids tell little white lies.
[170:07.15]Other... We need an answer, please.
[170:10.45]Are the kids friends?
[170:11.79]Siblings.
[170:12.23]Yeah, siblings.
[170:15.13]Is it them?
[170:16.05]Show us.
[170:16.93]The minister.
[170:17.45]The next family can steal.
[170:27.08]Other kids?
[170:27.84]Oh, shit.
[170:28.90]Don't get this.
[170:32.11]Taking up a long time.
[170:34.39]Grandparents.
[170:39.33]That's so fucking lame.
[170:40.99]That is so lame if they get that right.
[170:42.59]And they just won the game.
[170:47.04]They just won the game because of that.
[170:54.43]What was in third place?
[170:56.10]That's so dumb.
[170:57.16]The fifth most popular answer.
[170:58.72]That's why dudes like never, never play when it's in this round.
[171:03.92]They just got 246 points because they said one thing correct.
[171:08.00]And I had to guess like three fucking times.
[171:11.28]Let's check out how both families are doing after this round.
[171:13.52]I just lost.
[171:16.52]Very well done, family number two.
[171:17.78]I just fucking lost the game.
[171:19.78]What a shitty game show.
[171:20.86]Congratulations.
[171:22.37]What a piece of shit game show.
[171:24.15]They had zero fucking points.
[171:27.42]Why would you have that be a thing?
[171:30.66]Oh, that's great.
[171:31.74]You know, your family was losing the entire game and you said grandparents once and you won all the points.
[171:37.48]That's so fucking stupid.
[171:45.56]Like, what a fucking moronic.
[171:46.97]Computer opponent level.
[171:57.08]Spelling accuracy, loose.
[172:00.76]Let's see how dumb we can make, Pia.
[172:01.68]Let's see how dumb we can make.
[172:02.74]They can be even stupider.
[172:04.14]All right, this is the last one.
[172:06.74]Whatever happens, this is the last one.
[172:27.59]They're from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[172:29.43]Because I got to go pick up Kim.
[172:30.95]So this is the last one.
[172:32.61]But mostly tenacious.
[172:34.63]Give it up for family number two.
[172:36.25]The game couldn't be handled like this.
[172:40.14]The battle for big bucks on the Family Feud.
[172:44.42]I can't let that pass.
[172:45.68]Here he is, the host of Family Feud, Louie Anderson.
[172:56.45]Welcome to another game of Family Feud, everyone.
[172:59.01]What are we waiting for?
[172:59.83]Let's get started.
[173:00.73]So when you make them hard, you just make it so they would get every single question right.
[173:04.03]100 people surveyed.
[173:06.15]We've got their top five answers up there.
[173:08.13]Mostly sober, mostly, yeah.
[173:10.79]Name something people pad.
[173:12.49]People pad.
[173:13.19]I don't know.
[173:14.65]Your answer, family number two.
[173:18.15]Nice sneeze, sneeze answer.
[173:21.70]Pad income tax return.
[173:26.11]Survey set.
[173:28.75]That's a very specific card question.
[173:32.45]Good guess, but it's not there.
[173:33.81]Let's give family number one a shot.
[173:36.79]Income tax return.
[173:37.75]Something pad.
[173:39.27]Just income.
[173:40.95]All right.
[173:42.87]Why go so crazy with that?
[173:44.27]Just be literal.
[173:47.55]No, that's not it.
[173:48.97]Okay, then.
[173:49.84]Let's try another survey.
[173:53.80]How much money do you think Louis Anderson made for this gig?
[173:56.12]This specific thing here at the game?
[173:57.52]You know the drill.
[173:58.32]A hundred people did the survey.
[173:59.88]Top six answers up on the board.
[174:02.24]Good luck.
[174:03.05]Think he made more than 10 grand for this?
[174:04.37]Name something people rehearse.
[174:06.45]What do you think it is, family number one?
[174:07.95]Speech.
[174:10.49]Rehearse a speech.
[174:11.91]Survey says...
[174:19.28]One meatball sub.
[174:21.50]You guys are terrible.
[174:25.87]Poor Louis Anderson.
[174:26.95]You guys have been making fun of him all night.
[174:31.02]Dance steps.
[174:33.24]I love how making the opponent easy made them add words.
[174:40.07]Good guess, but it's not up there.
[174:42.57]I want to pass this.
[174:43.83]Family number one.
[174:44.85]Are you going to play or pass?
[174:45.69]Let's see how smart the easy opponent is.
[174:47.21]All right, family number two is going to play.
[174:48.83]There's way too many answers here.
[174:50.53]What do you think it is, family number two?
[174:52.46]If they were less than five, maybe.
[174:53.88]There's six possible answers here.
[174:56.04]What do you rehearse?
[174:58.80]Movies.
[175:00.06]Survey set.
[175:02.50]I guess you rehearse.
[175:05.09]It's not up there.
[175:06.05]Sorry.
[175:08.41]You don't rehearse movies.
[175:10.13]I don't know what that means.
[175:16.81]Concert.
[175:18.41]Concerts.
[175:19.01]I mean, you're just wrong.
[175:20.05]You rehearse like music.
[175:26.07]Let's think about this so I don't fuck this up.
[175:27.61]A speech, a play, a script.
[175:30.83]I'm going to say a play.
[175:38.55]When they inevitably get three wrong in a row.
[175:42.55]Ah, that's... They're gonna get it.
[175:45.79]Sorry, I gotta rehearse my movies, yeah.
[175:49.10]Ready?
[175:51.98]Play.
[175:52.50]Play's gonna be number one.

[175:56.62]Telephone.
[175:57.78]Reading.
[176:09.95]I mean, that is true.
[176:10.49]My father did record a telephone greeting back in the day like 30 times in a row because he wasn't happy with it.
[176:19.52]Okay.
[176:19.94]Play.
[176:21.26]Play.

[176:31.54]Say the word.
[176:32.02]Come on.
[176:34.30]Number one.
[176:34.79]There it is.
[176:35.23]When he says the word, it means you got it.

[176:46.26]No.
[177:10.29]Family number one, you are off to a great start.
[177:12.87]Family number two, you're not far off the lead.
[177:14.99]Oh, my God.
[177:15.65]It's round two.
[177:18.13]Guys, seriously.
[177:20.06]Leave him alone.
[177:20.82]He's like a nice guy.
[177:22.22]A hundred people surveyed.
[177:24.90]We've got the top three answers.
[177:28.18]So who is the other?
[177:28.94]Who else is in the end?
[177:29.90]If you were a single parent, tell me something you wouldn't let your dates do at your house.
[177:33.59]What do you think it is, family number one?
[177:34.77]Wait, what?
[177:34.99]If you were a single parent, tell me something you wouldn't let your date do at your house.

[177:50.29]Let's see what's on the board.
[177:55.37]Three answers.
[177:55.87]No, sorry.
[177:57.23]Family number two?
[177:58.39]Yeah, but you guys are writing sex.
[178:00.55]That's tough.
[178:01.19]That's like, yeah, I wouldn't let my date have sex in my house.
[178:04.69]Okay.
[178:06.77]You made the answer.
[178:07.45]Like, that doesn't say with me.
[178:11.05]Yeah, you can't smoke in my house, but you also, like, you can't have sex with somebody in my house?

[179:14.24]What happened to the other 12 people?
[179:18.62]What happened to the other 12 people?
[179:22.72]Let's see how our families are doing after round two.
[179:26.44]Huh?
[179:28.10]78 plus 6 plus 4 equals 100.
[179:28.80]Apparently.
[179:29.02]I don't know how that's possible.
[179:30.58]Family Feud exposed.
[179:32.60]We don't talk about the other 12 people.

[183:11.44]Just because trash is in the trash doesn't mean it's personal and not personal.
[183:15.50]What are you talking about?
[183:16.98]How many times have you guys thrown something away that was, like, personal to you but was just trash?
[183:21.62]Like, I ate a fucking... I had a bunch of bananas the other day that I threw in the trash.
[183:25.66]They were very personal to me.
[183:27.62]But they got gross and rotten and I had to throw a couple of them in the trash.
[183:31.76]They were personal.

[185:39.18]Let's flawless this one.
[185:41.98]Well done, family number one.

[185:47.78]Going to the Fast Money round is our big winner, family number one.
[185:51.60]There we go.
[185:58.61]A lot of people like boats, guys.
[186:00.92]Who's gonna play Fast Money?
[186:02.48]It doesn't even matter.
[186:03.96]I've made this same joke like a hundred times.
[186:07.03]So who cares?
[186:08.55]We have our first player.
[186:09.81]Good luck.
[186:10.41]The clock won't start until I finish reading the first question.
[186:13.21]Here we go.
[186:14.31]Name an occupation for which you would wear grubby clothes every day.
[186:17.39]Uh, janitor.
[186:20.14]Name a food you can spread.
[186:21.68]Butter.
[186:22.74]Name a place you hear very loud music.
[186:24.58]Concert.
[186:25.98]The best things in life are free.
[186:27.82]Name one.
[186:28.80]Um...
[186:30.54]What a loaded fucking question, asshole.
[186:36.07]I don't know.
[186:36.41]Name a place where some people go dressed up and others don't.
[186:39.77]I don't know.
[186:40.23]Let's see how you did.
[186:47.29]Name an occupation for which you would wear grubby clothes every day.
[186:50.43]Here's your answer.
[186:52.85]Let's see if it was there.
[186:55.25]What?
[186:56.35]It's not number one?
[187:00.36]How is gender not at least five to ten people?
[187:03.16]Name a food you can spread.
[187:04.82]Here's your answer.
[187:07.26]Show it to us.
[187:16.61]Name a place you hear very loud music.

[187:25.85]I fucked it up.
[187:31.55]The best things in life are free.
[187:33.39]Name one.
[187:34.17]You gave us... Oh, my God.
[187:36.97]What a bad answer.
[187:38.47]Two people.
[187:40.35]Two useless assholes wrote that.
[187:41.88]Like, that's so funny.
[187:43.28]I'm so glad that's up there, actually.
[187:46.44]Name a place where some people go dressed up and others don't.
[187:49.06]But these are such loaded questions.
[187:50.30]It didn't make any sense.
[187:52.20]Was it up there?
[187:53.64]Like, those last two questions are, like, just so vague and opinionated.
[187:57.70]Those are, like, opinions.
[187:59.71]Those aren't factual things.
[188:01.03]Those are just opinions.
[188:02.73]Our next player needs 140 points to win the fast money round.
[188:05.91]I forgot this whole game is opinions, isn't it?
[188:07.45]No, it's factual information.
[188:08.37]We now have our second player.
[188:09.33]Same five questions, looking for the most popular answers.
[188:11.99]Can't duplicate.
[188:12.67]Those two people are a couple.
[188:13.41]The clock won't start until I finish the first question.
[188:15.36]Good luck.
[188:16.26]Okay.
[188:16.60]Name an occupation for which you would wear grubby clothes every day.
[188:19.46]I mean like painter?
[188:22.92]Or like trash man.
[188:24.10]Painter.
[188:28.02]Name a food you can spread.
[188:31.41]Name a place you hear very loud music.
[188:34.49]The best things in life are free.

[188:39.99]I don't know.
[188:40.55]Fucking water?
[188:41.57]Name a place where some people go dressed up and others don't.
[188:46.57]A club?

[188:51.97]Name an occupation for which you would wear grubby clothes every day.
[188:54.92]Trash man.
[188:57.30]Let's see if it was there.
[188:59.24]Oh, come on.
[189:03.40]Come on.

[189:06.32]No, apparently not.
[189:08.59]Here's your answer.
[189:11.03]Show it to us.
[189:12.81]That's so stupid.
[189:13.77]A janitor and a trash man.
[189:14.99]Nobody said any of them.
[189:20.85]Name a place you hear very loud music.
[189:23.33]You answered.
[189:25.89]Was it up there?
[189:26.61]No.
[189:34.84]The best things in life are free.
[189:36.35]Name one.
[189:37.51]You said... Let's see if it was there.
[189:40.95]Name a place where some people go dressed up and others don't.
[189:52.62]Here's your answer.
[189:55.00]Was it up there?
[189:58.67]What?
[190:00.05]How?
[190:01.41]Some people go to the bar with the dressed up and some people go to the bar in like fucking ratty clothes.
[190:10.44]Those questions sucked.
[190:13.72]Those questions sucked, guys.

[190:33.98]A trash man's not on that list.
[190:36.82]What the fuck else could be on that list?
