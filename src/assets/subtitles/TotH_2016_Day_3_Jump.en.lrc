[00:14.71]Welcome back to Tip of the Hats.
[00:22.32]We're loving that video, the intro there.
[00:25.93]And wow, that's what rocket jumping might be like if it was real in real life.
[00:31.92]We got truck truck, we got Mela, my name's Ghetto Whale.
[00:34.74]We're getting ready now for the jump segment.
[00:37.54]And as fun as that little video was, every year for Tip of the Hats, the jump community puts together
[00:44.29]an unbelievable video and it's really a group effort the production value is out of this world the creativity in the video is out of this world and I personally am very excited for it and I mean that very honestly and so I think without further ado we're going to throw to that video guys you do not want to miss this and when we come back we will be speaking to the jumpers we're going to have the actual jump section but first of all take a look at this
[01:19.23]So, last week we covered a story on the, uh, sudden simultaneous disappearance of several people from around the world.
[01:31.15]They were all, um, jumpers.
[01:33.84]Well, tonight a few of them were found, and Rofus just interviewed a couple of them.
[01:37.34]What did they say, Rof?
[01:42.40]Well, they were unclear of where exactly they were taken.
[01:45.78]Some said a facility, some said a massive playground sort of thing.
[01:52.82]About half of them said it was a nightmare.
[02:09.33]Thank you.
[05:45.14]you
[09:14.05]so so
[09:52.75]so so
[10:30.26]you
[10:48.98]so
[11:09.65]Pretty wild.
[11:10.63]Very, very impressive.
[11:12.75]Unbelievable.
[11:13.59]We were looking at each other throughout the video at certain parts, just shaking our heads because that's all we can do.
[11:19.20]Pretty wild.
[11:21.23]So we are going to get started with some live jumping now.
[11:26.21]And I believe we have Vexxon with us in the Discord.
[11:29.52]Are you there, Vexxon?
[11:30.98]Yeah, dude, how you doing?
[11:32.20]Very, very good.
[11:33.36]We're all kind of like picking our jaws up off the floor a little bit.
[11:37.87]The videos that the Jump community has put together every year, like we said, for Tip of the Hats, it's like the production values through the roof every time.
[11:46.54]The creativity is through the roof every time.
[11:49.40]And it's like just when we think we've seen everything from year to year, you guys come up with new stuff.
[11:55.83]New tech.
[11:56.41]So congratulations, first of all, on that.
[11:58.55]I know a lot of work went into that video.
[12:01.47]Oh, yeah.
[12:02.45]Renew actually missed a bunch of days of school and stayed up a lot of nights for that video in this last two weeks.
[12:10.07]She didn't miss school.
[12:11.39]Don't miss school.
[12:12.35]School's important, Renew.
[12:14.03]Come on now.
[12:14.53]But it is a fantastic video.
[12:16.30]Editing, jumping.
[12:17.42]Wild.
[12:17.82]Amazing job.
[12:18.66]Absolutely fantastic.
[12:19.34]We won't sit here and geek and nerd out about it.
[12:21.69]So Vexon, welcome.
[12:23.57]And you're joined by and you will be joined by some of the best jumpers, of course, in the world as we get through this section here.
[12:31.16]So tell you what, why don't I give you the floor to maybe talk a bit about what we're doing and what people can expect over the next little bit here?
[12:39.86]Alright, yeah.
[12:41.00]We've got a bunch of different maps lined up and some new maps.
[12:45.41]We just had that amazing jump movie.
[12:47.17]We're going to close with another jump movie as well.
[12:50.94]Let's see.
[12:51.36]Right now, me and Melon are on Jump Above by Situ'd.
[12:55.66]Yep.
[12:56.29]And I thought we were going to do something a little bit different this year and just kind of do almost a little tutorial for jumping, just so people know what's going on.
[13:04.50]Because I feel like a lot of the time, people
[13:06.66]uh you know who watch it don't even know what's happening yeah absolutely I feel like this could you know we've tried in the past I mean we try to sort of talk about it but there's a difference between talking about it and actually seeing it uh done because a lot of people that watch you might be thinking to yourself what in the hell is that so I mean that's a fantastic idea yeah so uh yeah tell you what and I think throughout the are we still doing races and whatnot what do you guys have uh on slate for uh after this just as a little preview
[13:35.26]Yeah, we got some races set up.
[13:37.63]We have a Jump Academy race, I think, next for their new map that they're making.
[13:42.71]It's a small preview of it.
[13:44.08]And we've got a blind race, so none of the players have actually seen the map that's going to be played.
[13:51.03]Nice.
[13:51.69]And they're just going to race the map and hopefully finish in a decent amount of time.
[13:56.75]Cool.
[13:56.87]I like that.
[13:57.15]That sounds awesome.
[13:57.94]Yeah.
[13:59.14]We've got a lot.
[13:59.80]Yeah, we don't want to hold you up then, so why don't we kind of give you the floor to sort of talk and whatnot, I guess, and we can, you know, if we have questions or clarifications, stuff like that, we can try to hop in.
[14:10.66]How's that sound?
[14:11.70]Sounds good to me.
[14:12.54]Yeah, do it up.
[14:13.70]Alright, so the plan right now is I'll do a jump and somewhat explain it, and then the camera will switch over to Mellon, and he will do the jump and kind of explain it.
[14:24.61]I know it's a soldier map, so he kind of has to improvise a little bit to show you guys some of the demo things, but I think it'll be good.
[14:33.28]So I think I'll just start off with this jump.
[14:36.10]This is just a basic rocket jump.
[14:38.32]um the basic rocket jump just consists of crouching and and jumping and shooting at the same time like that it's pretty pretty easy not too much to it really yet um melon should probably go now alright yeah let's move over to the demo segment so unfortunately I'm working with a little bit of a ping problem here but I should be able to do this just fine so the basis of all demo jumping is this right here single sticky
[15:03.13]And just like Vexen said, you're going to want to jump and crouch at the same time to get the maximum potential out of your sticky bomb.
[15:10.20]And there are a few different ways that this can be done.
[15:11.94]This can be done in different directions.
[15:13.91]If you want to go straight up, you can go straight up.
[15:15.55]But for this jump, we want to go straight up and a little forward to get over the wall.
[15:22.42]Boom.
[15:23.90]Nicely done, dude.
[15:26.03]And then you shake your head for style points.
[15:28.32]Just let everyone know you got it.
[15:30.44]This is what we intended to do.
[15:32.02]This one's just a basic skip, which a lot of people use in all sorts of different play styles in TF2.
[15:40.26]I mean, competitive, it's definitely useful there.
[15:42.93]Whereas something like Wapogo isn't as useful.
[15:46.99]So I'm just going to show something else here with a single sticky.
[15:51.62]This jump, as you might notice, is a lot farther horizontally than the other jump.
[15:55.50]The other jump was very short.
[15:57.29]So to do this with a single sticky, you want to do the jump and crouch as you kind of walk forward out of the sticky's radius.
[16:03.52]So that way you get propelled forward instead of up.
[16:09.15]Boom.
[16:09.85]Nice.
[16:10.51]Alright.
[16:11.29]I just want to say one more thing about skips.
[16:12.91]Skips, you don't actually touch the ground or anything.
[16:14.99]You're completely over the ground.
[16:16.35]It's almost basically a pogo.
[16:19.64]Yeah, so you're kind of just, you're just, yeah, pogo, I mean, kind of speaks for itself.
[16:23.20]You picture a pogo stick, you're kind of just like, you know, shooting down and kind of shooting yourself forward off the ground, yeah.
[16:30.59]Yeah, and then this is just another pretty basic jump.
[16:33.62]It's just wall shots.
[16:35.71]It's another thing that's really used a lot in different play styles for TF2.
[16:44.65]Alright, so how would the demo do this one?
[16:46.55]Let's have a look at Melon and see because it might be similar but different.
[16:50.42]Yeah, so talk us through it here.
[16:51.76]So you know that you can detonate stickies obviously on the ground, but you can also detonate a sticky while it's in the air and still get knockback from it.
[16:59.31]And this is used in a somewhat advanced to extremely advanced technique that we call air pogo, which kind of implies that it's pogo done in the air.
[17:06.96]This can be chained together, many stickies or just one.
[17:10.10]I'm going to try to do one for you here.
[17:14.79]Nice.
[17:16.11]Boom.
[17:17.00]It's beautiful.
[17:19.26]So, I mean, overall, would you say that the demo jumping stuff is harder than Soldier, or does it depend on the map, or are they close in, you know, or is it kind of high?
[17:31.20]I think they both have equally high skill ceilings.
[17:34.30]Yeah.
[17:34.62]I agree.
[17:35.06]To be honest, yeah.
[17:36.30]Cool.
[17:37.19]I mean, I can't demo.
[17:38.15]I'm terrible at demo.
[17:40.31]Some of the concepts are the same, but it's definitely a different skill pretty much to learn, right?
[17:45.54]Yeah, definitely.
[17:46.54]Yeah.
[17:47.66]um this jump you could do a number of ways you could do a sink wall shots you could do a tele sync so for those who don't know what is a sink a sink is basically where I mean it's kind of what it sounds like you just sync up a rocket with another one and instead of using one to jump yeah you got two or three or four or five
[18:12.47]And it can go pretty much, I don't know the actual rocket limit for like the speed that you get, but I think it's like seven, yeah.
[18:24.47]So this one you can do a number of ways.
[18:26.73]I mean, wall shots, sinks, a bunch of other things.
[18:30.46]There's a lot of different things you can do in jumping.
[18:33.02]Yeah, and with sinks is when you really start to get into the timing, when the timing of the rockets becomes important, right?
[18:39.42]Yeah, definitely.
[18:41.26]So let's have a look at Melon here.
[18:42.84]So now we're going to start using multiple stickies.
[18:45.73]And usually most people know if you use two stickies, you can live.
[18:50.23]So it's similar to one sticky bomb jump.
[18:52.12]You're going to crouch and jump when you're on the two stickies.
[18:58.55]There you go.
[18:59.27]Nice.
[18:59.59]Now, one thing we noticed, and people might be scratching their heads, is that obviously, Melon, you hurt yourself with those stickies.
[19:06.42]You're down to 45 health.
[19:07.91]But as you flew through the air there, you got health.
[19:10.79]And that's not through magic, right?
[19:12.25]It's the fact that you're on a jump map.
[19:14.62]You weren't healed up or something.
[19:16.88]Yeah, there's no invisible medics or anything like that.
[19:20.00]But that's just a part of the map, right?
[19:21.92]Well, most of these maps.
[19:23.83]Some of the older ones aren't so great with it, but there's regen that will regen your health and sometimes your ammo, so you won't die.
[19:29.73]Yep.
[19:30.55]Speaking of ammo, I just saw it flash up on screen.
[19:32.78]We have the incentive for the pipe launcher jumping, which we want to mention.
[19:38.44]I mean, can you talk about that?
[19:39.97]I know that you're doing kind of the stickies here right now, but the pipe launcher jumping is a lot tougher, isn't it, Mellon?
[19:47.68]Oh yeah, you know, Pipe Launcher Jumping is something that I am terrible at, that I've never been able to get down.
[19:52.75]And I think there is going to be some other people, if we reach that incentive, that you're going to want to watch.
[19:57.21]But it's very limited in what can be done, obviously, because you can really not use more than one at a time, except in different circumstances where you can kind of time it.
[20:06.21]It's really limited and difficult, but you might think it's pretty fun if you see it done by someone with skill.
[20:11.34]Yeah, we're just under 4,000 on that.
[20:13.44]It's kind of like a super handicap, which makes it even better to watch.
[20:17.00]Saw it in the video for one of the jumps.
[20:19.23]Yeah, we saw it.
[20:20.31]Oh, my gosh.
[20:20.93]We were going bonkers on that, yeah.
[20:22.75]Jumping with both a sticky and a pill.
[20:25.72]Yeah, that was one of the most insane demo jumps I think I've ever seen.
[20:28.26]Yeah, we liked it.
[20:29.16]Shout out to Walrex.
[20:30.26]Tell you what, take it away here on this one.
[20:32.58]Alright, so this is just your basic jerf, which is like a combination of jumping and surfing.
[20:36.81]You can just surf, but you don't have the same...
[20:40.56]Eryxell?
[20:41.90]Eryxell, yeah, surfing.
[20:43.33]So you need rockets for this one.
[20:46.77]Because, I mean, this is a soldier map.
[20:48.19]You can do it as demo, but it's definitely weird.
[20:51.21]And you just want to hold your opposite key to where you would slide off.
[20:55.50]So if I was sliding off left, I'd hold my D key.
[20:58.70]And you kind of just strafe and shoot, just like a surf, but with rockets.
[21:02.44]Yeah, we had the surf segment yesterday.
[21:04.14]We talked a bit about that kind of stuff.
[21:05.85]So how about for the demo version?
[21:07.87]Is it similar for you, Mellon?
[21:09.37]Oh yeah.
[21:10.41]I would have liked to have done something more fancy on this jump, but unfortunately the ping kind of limits me.
[21:14.52]So what I'm going to talk about is all in the same vein as what Vexen was talking about.
[21:19.08]I can't really do this while I talk because I have to hold the key.
[21:22.37]But when you hold A on a ramp that is slanted downward on the left side, you'll stay on it.
[21:28.46]And the same thing, opposite, if you hold D on a ramp that's slanted downwards on the right, you'll stay on it.
[21:33.20]And this works for demo too.
[21:34.45]And you can put stickies on these ramps, as you can see.
[21:37.87]And you can gain lots of speed from stickying off ramps because you have the effect of sliding and the effect of the sticky.
[21:44.73]So I'm going to showcase that.
[21:53.70]nice nice now we go through the tunnel of uh fun here tunnel of love while you're doing that we have a we got a lot of people hyped up for the jump we had 10 bucks from fibu saying jump hype we had a Dr. cube with a hundred dollars says streamer please play spy you know there's no spy jumping there's no spy jumping but maybe next year will someone will uh figure it out so what do we got here now boys
[22:17.29]This is your basic pogo jump.
[22:20.81]Pogo is probably one of the hardest things to learn in jumping, I think, because, I mean, I don't know, it took me the longest for sure.
[22:27.74]It's definitely weird to wrap your head around how it works.
[22:31.87]We have your show keys here on the screen to see.
[22:34.75]I don't know if you want to try to do it again so we could see that you were using, obviously, the shoot button, the mouse one.
[22:40.25]Yeah.
[22:40.71]And it's all sort of mapped out here.
[22:42.24]So, I mean, do you want to sort of talk about, you know, why are you pressing the certain things?
[22:47.21]Yeah, so you definitely want to be crouched.
[22:49.25]If you uncrouch, you'll fall.
[22:51.24]But you want to hold crouch.
[22:52.84]I always hold space just because I have a problem with my keys.
[22:56.01]I don't know.
[22:56.91]And you really just, I don't know.
[22:59.01]It's kind of hard to explain.
[22:59.97]You got to get the feel for it.
[23:01.19]Sure.
[23:02.44]But you can just basically maneuver wherever you want to.
[23:05.30]when you've reached a decent point at getting good at it.
[23:09.82]It's hard to explain.
[23:10.99]A lot of jumping is definitely getting the feel for it.
[23:13.59]It also is dependent on what rocket launcher you're using, if you're using the original or the stock.
[23:18.57]True.
[23:19.33]Because the original shoots it up from the center of your model, whereas the regular rocket launcher, it's slightly off-center.
[23:26.44]It shoots it to the left.
[23:27.68]What do you think are the most important key aspects of doing the pogo off the wall, though?
[23:32.61]What do you think is the most important thing to have the grip on?
[23:35.07]It depends, again, on your view model.
[23:37.71]But like for the stock one, you basically almost always want to be holding W. If you look left, you'll go higher because your rocket comes out of the right of your screen.
[23:46.75]Right.
[23:47.33]And a lot of people, I think, just learn to like tap D a lot.
[23:51.10]You never really hold A, I guess, unless you're going left.
[23:54.28]But I don't know.
[23:54.85]It's hard to explain.
[23:56.13]Now that I think about it.
[23:57.01]It's just all about finding that sweet spot.
[23:59.39]For me personally, I've learned how to do the basics of soldier jumping over the past few months.
[24:04.64]It's just finding that sweet spot and just getting comfortable.
[24:07.29]It's kind of second nature after doing it a few times.
[24:10.59]Exactly.
[24:11.59]Cool.
[24:11.97]So how about you, Mellon?
[24:13.68]Alright, so similar to what Vexen just said, pogo is really hard for a lot of people, I think, especially on demo, because the key to pogo on demo is you need to have two stickies on the ground, pretty much at all times.
[24:25.93]So when you detonate one sticky, there should always be another sticky ready to catch you, and it's hard for people to understand this concept, because when you have one sticky, and you try to pogo with one sticky, and then shoot another one, by the time you come down, that sticky's not armed yet.
[24:39.57]So I'm going to try to show how you keep two stickies on the ground at all times.
[24:49.99]This is where the difficulty really ramps up.
[24:54.37]This is where it really sort of separates and, you know, it becomes more of a demo thing and less a universal thing.
[25:00.75]But that's impressive.
[25:02.11]And for those that don't know, this particular map does get a bit harder.
[25:05.19]They are showcasing the basics of Demo and Soldier.
[25:08.26]So when we get into the more ridiculous and complex maps, hopefully the viewers that aren't familiar with jumping as Demo and Soldier kind of can wrap their heads around how crazy all this is.
[25:19.88]So we're working our way through this map and yeah, let's continue.
[25:25.78]And yeah, this is just another basic surf jump.
[25:30.65]I don't want to spend too much time on it because I think we are actually taking a little bit longer than we should.
[25:35.06]Sure.
[25:36.69]But yeah, that's just a basic surf jump or derf jump.
[25:39.69]Just like the last one.
[25:40.61]It's just got a nice turn to it.
[25:42.38]Yep.
[25:43.52]I'm going to do the same thing as him.
[25:44.68]It's very similar to the one we just showcased.
[25:46.49]I'll try to breeze through it.
[25:51.54]I noticed your ducking there.
[25:52.68]Is the ducking almost a little more important with the demo because you fly off differently, don't you, depending on whether you crouch or not?
[26:00.25]Yeah, that's correct.
[26:01.11]It's pretty important to crouch almost all the time.
[26:03.54]There are situations where you would want to be uncrouched, and that's usually when you just want a little boost or a specific situation.
[26:09.45]But if you don't crouch, you generally don't go anywhere.
[26:11.91]Yep.
[26:12.54]So what do we got here now, Vaxen?
[26:14.52]We got the first speed shot.
[26:15.98]This is probably the jump I will choke on if I choke or the bounces.
[26:20.91]A speed shot is kind of weird because it's like a skip except you actually touch the ground and that one unit while you are on the ground, your rocket hits the exact same time.
[26:31.73]And so it's really like, it's kind of like a bounce almost because you hit the ground right as your rocket does.
[26:39.16]And I don't really know why it works, but it does.
[26:41.29]And you just, you kind of go flying from it.
[26:44.01]You get your speed still and you also get a good boost because you're as close as you can be to your rocket.
[26:48.12]So that's all about timing there, right?
[26:50.60]Yeah.
[26:51.40]All of these things are kind of peculiarities of the source engine that allow you to do these kind of things, right?
[26:57.01]Yeah.
[26:58.60]Millen?
[26:59.61]Alright, so I'm going to try to do something to show off a little bit of height control and movement control.
[27:05.36]So as you can see, there's a green ceiling there, which means that if you tried to go straight across and didn't control your height, you hit the green ceiling and fail.
[27:12.43]So similar to what Vexen just did, this might be something that I could choke on a little bit with the ping, but I'm going to try to show how I use the S key in specific to slow myself so I don't hit the wall.
[27:27.29]Nice.
[27:28.25]Well done, dude.
[27:29.31]Didn't even need the S. Yeah, in that time I didn't.
[27:32.95]Well, could you strafe to the right to avoid the wall?
[27:35.42]So just the strafing mechanics allowed you to make it through.
[27:39.38]So we got something new here.
[27:41.24]Yeah, it's just the basic thing.
[27:42.90]So just shoot one rocket and shoot the second one and do a rocket jump right as it hits you.
[27:49.09]It's pretty self-explanatory.
[27:50.81]It's definitely one of the weirder things to learn, but once you get it down, it's definitely easy.
[27:55.73]Is this going to look similar for you, Millen?
[27:57.86]Not exactly.
[27:58.94]I wanted to show a better representation of strafing because as you can see there, there's a little ring on the top of that jump.
[28:05.76]And if you land outside of that ring, you will fail the jump and be teleported back.
[28:09.50]So you need to strafe into that ring.
[28:12.15]And when you use two sticky bombs, you're going to go way farther and way faster than that ring.
[28:16.81]So I want to show actually how you can strafe, use the S keys and A keys to get in that hole.
[28:25.64]Nice.
[28:26.00]And there you go, just tapping that S key to just slow down just a little bit.
[28:29.14]Yeah, control.
[28:31.13]Alright, this jump is... It's got a lot of different ways you can do it as Soldier.
[28:35.71]There's actually two different types of bounces, which I kind of want to talk about for a minute because bounces are really weird.
[28:42.16]I don't really know how they work either, but... Just really good at them.
[28:46.39]Yeah, we'll have RNC in later.
[28:48.23]Maybe he'll explain it because he's a genius at that, but...
[28:51.36]I know that there's different heights for some reason that work for certain types of bounces.
[28:57.71]Like there's a number of different bounces, but the main ones are crouch bounces.
[29:01.89]So you do something like that.
[29:03.37]Nailed it.
[29:03.91]And you're not touching the ground right there, are you?
[29:06.46]No, I think so, but the tele doesn't register.
[29:09.69]Okay, so if he were not to shoot a rocket at a specific time while falling, he would get reset.
[29:15.48]So you have to bounce right off the ground at a perfect time, and it launches you up as if you're rocket jumping, which is a very neat mechanic.
[29:23.20]yeah and then the other type of balance is like a bounce hop which you also need a specific height for and I'll probably mess this up but um most people have it bound like their jump key bound to their mouse wheel so they don't mess this up but I use space because I don't know how to keep with the times interesting but um that's what you do you just jump right as you hit the ground um and then you can also down pogo this jump
[29:46.81]And just, you know, there's a number of different ways, but those are definitely like speedrun strats.
[29:50.99]I'm envious of your downpogoing skills.
[29:53.56]Yeah, man, the downpogoing is always super hard.
[29:55.68]It's difficult, yeah.
[29:56.40]That's a tough one.
[29:57.20]Yep.
[29:58.36]Melon, you're up.
[29:58.98]Takes a long time to learn.
[29:59.68]Alright, yeah.
[30:00.39]Downpogoing on demo is a lot easier than on soldier because the sticky bombs have so much more power.
[30:05.35]So I'm going to show how I can use the sticky positioning, which is mostly my mouse, following the two sticky rule to climb down this wall and then up.
[30:21.13]Wow.
[30:21.77]You say it's easier, but there's no way it is.
[30:25.05]That's wild.
[30:25.49]Such a sharp angle, too.
[30:26.82]A tight angle on that wall.
[30:27.96]It was well done.
[30:29.79]This will be the first jump where we introduce water.
[30:32.73]And water is really, really glitchy in this game.
[30:36.06]It's not very nice, especially when you put ramps next to it.
[30:39.40]But we'll talk about those, I think, next jump.
[30:42.06]This one, you just want to hold space in the water.
[30:44.47]If you hold space, you'll float and you can actually keep your speed pretty well.
[30:49.19]And I just did a sink in there and got some speed and flew over here.
[30:53.30]Fair enough.
[30:54.61]Alright.
[30:55.19]Just a simple water sink.
[30:56.60]Wall sink this time.
[30:58.48]Well, sink stickies.
[30:59.96]So you can put stickies on the floor, but you can also put them on walls a lot of the time.
[31:03.55]And this, of course, makes it easier for you to have momentum going sideways because the two stickies will push you sideways instead of up.
[31:11.55]Oh, there you go.
[31:12.31]Don't have to get wet.
[31:14.78]Alright.
[31:16.92]This is the thing that everybody hates in jumping right here is water and ramps put together because ramps are very glitchy, as you might find out if I mess this up.
[31:28.65]No, I didn't.
[31:29.17]But a lot of the time you get stuck on them and there's nothing you can do about it.
[31:33.62]There's a new jump plugin that might fix them.
[31:37.56]It does a pretty good job so far, but it's still not 100% bulletproof.
[31:41.59]never knew that so because that's happened to me a bunch of times on jump maps with the ramps so they're that's just out of your control yeah they're it doesn't matter you could be going really fast and sometimes they just glitch stops yeah you get stuck in them yeah and water and ramps are the worst combo for sure they don't mix keep that in mind kids not as bad as jumping as I thought I was yeah there we go when they work it's beautiful when they don't work it sucks
[32:05.11]Alright, Melanie, we're on you about this on this on a search segment where they were talking about ramp bugs in the engine.
[32:11.22]Yeah.
[32:11.40]And yeah, just look back and said, you really can't do anything about this.
[32:14.29]You can be going as fast or as slow and just stop.
[32:17.53]Luckily, this doesn't affect them too much.
[32:19.05]But what I'm going to show is a lot of people not misconstrue, but they don't understand the fact that you can indeed survive a jump using three stickies.
[32:28.60]if you get on top of them you'll die because they'll kill you but yeah that's easy enough correlation between dying and being dead yeah yeah if you're in front of them by a certain distance when you get the full force doesn't hit you so you don't die but you get much more knockback than just with two so let's go ahead and hope I don't die on this one
[32:48.92]Nice.
[32:51.37]And if he did, he would have been immortalized anyway.
[32:53.43]Yes.
[32:55.33]This is just basic rocket jumps, wild shots.
[32:58.88]I don't want to spend too much time.
[33:00.40]We're definitely running low on time.
[33:02.22]Yeah, it seems like this map at this point kind of has gotten through the basics and just applies the basics and mushes them all together in the later jumps here.
[33:13.42]Yeah, I mean, do it as quick as you guys need to.
[33:15.20]We want to try to stay on time so you guys can do everything you want to do.
[33:18.89]I think we got two more jumps after this.
[33:22.16]Yeah, we'll make this quick.
[33:23.42]Cool.
[33:24.24]Alright, yeah, this one I'm just going to show how.
[33:26.32]It was kind of like the down pogo from before, but instead you're going up.
[33:37.52]Nice.
[33:38.24]Nice.
[33:38.69]Nobody beefing yet.
[33:40.31]Oh, yeah.
[33:40.83]You just jinxed it.
[33:42.84]Yeah, you just jinxed it.
[33:44.44]No, that's just skips.
[33:46.39]Just three skips and then some jerfs.
[33:48.88]Simple enough.
[33:49.68]Nice.
[33:50.56]I'm impressed.
[33:51.78]Alright, there's something I do want to talk about here just before we go to the last jump.
[33:55.71]And I can't really show you this right now because the region on the server won't necessarily allow for it.
[34:01.32]But there is a technique that demos use called a pre-fire, which is where they put down two or sometimes three stickies.
[34:07.35]And then as they walk over them in debt, they shoot another sticky into the air in front of them.
[34:12.17]And this means that when they get the stickies that are on the ground,
[34:15.24]the one in the air will get almost immediately.
[34:17.30]So they get two knockbacks, one from the one on the ground and one from the one in the air, which allows them to go a lot farther.
[34:22.83]And you would die if you did this without a certain amount of regen or luck.
[34:26.51]But I'm just going to do a three sticky thing so I don't die.
[34:32.13]I'm going to land on this ramp.
[34:33.42]You can land on the top.
[34:36.06]Boo.
[34:37.20]No, I don't know how else you'd be able to do this as demo, to be honest.
[34:40.32]If you land on the ramp, you just slide so far down because of the momentum.
[34:43.77]Yeah, that's right.
[34:45.90]And here is the last jump.
[34:48.11]This is just the basic sinks, you know?
[34:52.20]Got a lot of sinks, and this is actually a quad, but you can quint it like this.
[34:59.35]Normally, it would be a lot higher for a Quint, but that was a quad.
[35:05.76]Most jumpers are watching it saying, how did he just do it?
[35:08.70]Yeah, I noticed on this map, a lot of people love this map, but get stuck on this stage.
[35:12.79]Learning how to Quint is quite difficult.
[35:15.35]The timing is wild.
[35:15.93]I was going to say, one time I was streaming on this map, and on this jump, I was stuck here for an hour and a half.
[35:20.48]I was doing the first try, so, well, there you go.
[35:22.70]No problem.
[35:23.49]Good night.
[35:23.93]We know why Vexen's here.
[35:26.41]Mel, what do you got?
[35:28.25]Ping plays a big part in syncing, for sure.
[35:31.10]If you have high ping, you've got to pass the rocket and then shoot.
[35:33.79]If you have low ping, like zero, you'd shoot right as it passes your screen.
[35:39.90]Alright, Melon?
[35:41.20]right so this wall is obviously way too high to just use two stickies you'd make it maybe halfway three quarters up but you wouldn't make it all the way up so there's a technique that jumpers use which we call vertical air pogo which as the name implies pushes you up instead of horizontal and this can be done in two forms crouched and uncrouched if you uncrouch the timing is negligible because the stickies push you by a standard amount so you can just kind of spam the button if you crouch you have to time it correctly so I'm not going to do that
[36:07.84]and we better hope that ping doesn't screw this one up.
[36:12.85]We can only hope.
[36:15.59]Oh, look at that.
[36:16.20]There's one.
[36:17.32]It's okay.
[36:18.88]Ping in jumping is very important.
[36:23.65]A lot of speedruns, from my understanding, are actually done on local servers because of the zero ping consistency.
[36:31.74]Really can be finicky.
[36:33.71]So yeah, that's basically it.
[36:35.70]That took a bit, but I hope we got the general idea.
[36:40.73]I think we should be going to a jump race right now, the Jump Academy race.
[36:45.81]There we go.
[36:46.63]We'll let you guys load that up.
[36:48.01]I want to get a bunch of donations here.
[36:49.58]Whenever there's jump, people go nuts with the donations.
[36:53.10]So let's see.
[36:54.06]We got A Cup, $10, says, can't wait for jumping.
[36:56.65]I'll miss Kip and the sentry jumping.
[36:58.61]Can't wait to see him again sometime.
[37:00.49]Swede donated $40, saying, shout out to Syro, Fishy, Huma, Juno, Blind, and the entire jump community.
[37:07.97]We had, let's see as well, Pan Pan, $100, saying, jumping, smiley face.
[37:14.05]We had $250 from Steven M. saying, four kids.
[37:19.45]Shout out to my boys at Resurfed and Jump TF.
[37:22.26]Love y'all.
[37:24.24]Liz the Wiz just put down $100 as well, saying, hey, Lemon, melon in brackets, Vex, Lil Gib, Zyke, Shigets, Jones Sausage, someone I know, and everyone else.
[37:36.00]Thank you, Liz the Wiz.
[37:37.84]thank you we got more coming too keep those donations coming in guys actually speaking of the donations the incentive we still uh we're still trying to reach plant eating meat put down at 20 and said uh talked about starting school recently he bought the shirt but he says these 20 bucks are going towards the pipe launcher race which I'm sure nobody wants to miss greetings from Germany that's right no one doesn't want to miss it so you better reach out please guys thank you so much for donating but keep it coming yep we're almost at 130k
[38:08.69]almost almost are we almost in the server or we got some more donations there's tons here uh the pins of course and t-shirts are still available uh maybe we can get the link for the shirts up there the teespring's available all weekend and there I don't think there's any limit on numbers for that uh we have hyperion rising saying toth is the best event of the year absolutely love all you guys
[38:30.46]So enjoyable seeing everyone so much.
[38:32.68]$30 put down.
[38:34.46]We had an anonymous one here.
[38:35.99]You guys might be interested in this, jumpers.
[38:38.15]I don't know who it is.
[38:38.85]$20.
[38:39.71]Says, good luck to everyone in the jump segment.
[38:41.90]Maybe next year some of us old schoolers can come back and show you how to really jump.
[38:46.42]Winky face.
[38:47.48]Winky face.
[38:47.97]We don't know who that is.
[38:50.11]But it's an old-schooler, supposedly.
[38:52.90]Reptile.
[38:53.94]Yeah, reptile.
[38:56.19]So are we back in game here now?
[38:57.91]Are we on the next map here for the race?
[38:59.93]Here we are.
[39:00.53]We see people.
[39:03.22]So who we got here?
[39:06.32]We've got... We're still waiting for people to join up, I guess.
[39:11.07]So Vexen, are you still there to talk us through?
[39:12.72]Or is Vexen... Hello?
[39:13.98]Hello?
[39:14.87]He's dragging people and stuff.
[39:16.05]Just dragging people in.
[39:17.23]He's busy.
[39:18.30]We got Zig, Zaddy.
[39:19.32]We got Fractal, Brought, Gorge, Fishy, Mesley.
[39:23.98]Some of these people, I recognize the names because they've been donating throughout the weekend.
[39:27.35]Yeah.
[39:28.09]Yeah.
[39:28.29]They put the money where the mouth is.
[39:29.69]Supposedly.
[39:31.89]Supposedly.
[39:32.62]Supposedly.
[39:33.68]Supposedly.
[39:34.76]Chipotle.
[39:35.48]Chipotle.
[39:36.93]Alright.
[39:37.37]Sorry about that.
[39:38.09]I had to drag some people in here.
[39:39.75]We got some, uh, the top level jumpers in here.
[39:42.49]We got a B share, John D fractal brought RNC and tort.
[39:50.97]Um, in the, uh, the race we've got, uh,
[39:55.18]My Masley, Divine, Fishy, Gorge, Fractalbrot, and Zigzotti.
[40:02.11]And this is the Jump Academy race.
[40:04.10]Cool.
[40:05.22]So they're going to race, and are you jumping Vexen, or are you going to be able to talk and tell us about the map and whatnot?
[40:10.86]I'll be able to talk and stuff.
[40:12.05]I think Fractalbrot is the JA guy, but he's jumping, so I'll do my best to talk about that stuff.
[40:20.41]I made the map, so.
[40:22.61]There you go.
[40:23.28]Yeah, we know Fractal was in on the Pub Communities event the other day.
[40:27.50]But no, take it away, boys.
[40:28.36]Alright, and I'm going to count it down.
[40:32.18]Three, two, one, go.
[40:37.93]Sorry, that was hard.
[40:38.63]I had to type and talk at the same time.
[40:40.49]That's cool.
[40:41.29]So this is the new Jump Academy map that we're working on.
[40:44.60]It's like Divine got a bit of a late start.
[40:46.82]Yeah, this is a preview of the brand new Jump Academy map.
[40:50.91]RNC, who's in here, made a lot of this.
[40:54.89]Did you make every course in this?
[40:57.42]I made two of the courses that are in here.
[40:59.50]We actually have like 10 or 12 people that are working on this map.
[41:02.52]So it's a huge project.
[41:04.93]Yeah, I've definitely seen it.
[41:06.33]And right now, this is the easy strafe course that was made by Situ'd.
[41:14.28]Soutou is one of the bigger map makers.
[41:16.72]And I mean, is map making, is it an addictive thing?
[41:19.53]I mean, once you make one deer, you're just kind of hooked for life then, guys?
[41:24.58]You kind of hate it for the first like 300 hours, and then after that, you start to enjoy it.
[41:29.45]Only 300, right?
[41:32.96]that's kind of what the the mapper we had I think it was crash uh was saying when he was making maps when you're learning it it's very difficult but once you once you get it down it's it's very rewarding and these this map is beautiful and this is this is a new map uh this is the easy wall shot course which was made I think it was made by pardonesis pretty sure on that I don't have any notes looks clean it does look very clean it's got a good look uh but
[42:02.79]Yeah, working with Hammer, there's like a million things that you can learn.
[42:08.16]And it's just impossible to absorb all of that at one time.
[42:12.44]So that's why a lot of people get really frustrated and just give up immediately.
[42:17.37]I like this.
[42:17.87]We've got the leaderboard.
[42:19.01]I don't remember the live leaderboard in the corner from previous races.
[42:23.43]We've got right in the lead.
[42:25.24]We've got a couple jumpers actually on jump 23.
[42:27.54]I like that.
[42:28.34]That's a new thing, I believe.
[42:29.48]Is it not?
[42:30.62]Or at least we haven't had it in... Yeah, that's the thing that...
[42:34.13]Are you guys using the jump plugin to see who's in first?
[42:38.34]Yeah.
[42:38.46]Yeah, that thing is pretty neat.
[42:39.66]That is very cool.
[42:41.37]So this is the sync course, I imagine.
[42:43.95]Yes, this is the easy sync course, which I think this was also made by Parnesis or Protist.
[42:51.34]I can't remember their names.
[42:54.59]I hope it's one of them.
[42:57.11]Yeah, I do too.
[43:00.92]Fishies in first, I think.
[43:04.14]We got two.
[43:04.66]We got Mazzoli now as well.
[43:06.58]Fractal hot on their heels.
[43:08.63]Actually, Fractal now on Jump 27 as well.
[43:12.00]Going to be close.
[43:12.80]Got three people on jump 27.
[43:14.20]Looks like Fishy is still in front here.
[43:16.54]A couple more donations, guys, we want to get to if we can.
[43:19.59]HumaHuma put down 22-22.
[43:21.01]A bunch of us know Huma.
[43:23.41]Says, want to say thank you to everyone doing another tip of the hats.
[43:25.89]Everyone in this community is so amazing and nice.
[43:27.98]Want to give a shout out to all my jumper friends for being really skilled.
[43:31.16]Also, hashtag dandy is a butt.
[43:33.80]P.S.
[43:34.16]TruckTruck said he'll tip his hat live, and he hasn't.
[43:36.36]I don't have a hat.
[43:37.23]It doesn't have a hat.
[43:38.01]That's your answer.
[43:38.61]I will if I get a hat.
[43:39.55]That's your answer on that.
[43:40.73]I need a hat.
[43:41.48]$10 from Dan who says, I always look forward to the jump segment.
[43:44.50]As an amateur jumper, it's super exciting to see my jumps make it into these movies with some of the best of the best while being streamed to thousands of people.
[43:52.52]Thanks to Tip of the Hats for all you do and to Renew.
[43:54.83]for making the movie and accepting my jump.
[43:59.15]And as well, Catface, $30, donating third year.
[44:03.28]Great work, as always.
[44:04.08]Hyped, as always, for the jumping.
[44:05.69]Just want to give a quick shout-out to the guys at Chill on my server, too.
[44:09.61]Much love.
[44:10.30]We're getting more jump comments.
[44:12.80]And here's Centrionic, $100 with a Catface.
[44:15.79]thank you sentry on a cat face thanks all you people and we'll be reading them out as much as we can while still getting the giving the jumpers their time so we're looking at fishy's point of view right now climbing a wall he's doing great this is the easy pogo course that I made actually
[44:30.84]it's actually pretty cool too because from what I've seen there's multiple ways to do each jump like you'll probably see them do a shortcut here yeah that's the shortcut yeah interesting I really wanted to add that into the design for this because if we can teach people like the basics of just how to speed run a jump map how to look for strats and all that you know I might as well start with pogo
[44:50.85]Yeah, that's cool.
[44:52.34]I mean, the more I watch this, the more I'm just going to be wondering, when the hell do I get to play it myself, you know?
[44:59.04]It looks cool.
[44:59.86]It does.
[45:00.30]It's definitely a better version of the Last Jump Academy map.
[45:03.67]That's for sure.
[45:04.51]Yeah.
[45:05.55]As you'll see, I think my favorite course on this map is the Jerf course because it's so speedrun friendly.
[45:13.22]There's so many strats that are just obviously meant to be used.
[45:18.63]I feel you.
[45:19.61]We got some pipe hype on the donations.
[45:21.69]$30 anonymous pipe hype.
[45:23.75]Alex Acutioner, $10 pipe hype.
[45:27.00]I've got my pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe.
[45:31.06]Guys, we got pipe, pipe.
[45:32.59]It's going to be a good time.
[45:33.81]Yeah.
[45:34.13]We need to attain the pipe, pipe.
[45:36.21]Got to hit up that money.
[45:38.14]Hit those pennies.
[45:38.80]How far away are we?
[45:40.06]30 bucks.
[45:41.00]I don't know.
[45:41.44]I don't know how.
[45:42.02]Let's get it up to date.
[45:43.71]It looks like 3.6k.
[45:47.10]3.6k.
[45:47.32]$4,410.
[45:48.52]That's not even close.
[45:50.26]I don't know how to math.
[45:52.21]5.6.
[45:53.23]Well, if we get 3.6, we'll be closer.
[45:55.57]Yep.
[45:56.94]That will be much closer.
[45:58.60]So here's Fractal now in the woods, in the forest, doing his thing.
[46:03.05]This is the trip course.
[46:04.92]Yeah, this is the jerf course and the one that we just saw, that was the all blue one.
[46:10.27]That was the easy mixed course, which is just sort of a variety of everything.
[46:13.96]And that was the one that I made.
[46:15.94]And this is the medium jerf course.
[46:19.04]And this was made by Power John, the maker of the original Jump Jerv.
[46:25.31]And it was detailed by Ciro, who is actually very new to the community.
[46:29.98]Cool.
[46:30.60]And he's a very, very talented map maker.
[46:33.14]Is that how you say it?
[46:33.90]Ciro?
[46:34.02]Isn't it Poner John?
[46:35.78]I thought it was Poner John.
[46:37.41]We just call him John, honestly.
[46:39.89]Oh, Power John?
[46:40.43]Lost the poner.
[46:41.51]I mean, he's a poner in my heart, regardless of what he thinks.
[46:44.82]A lot of poners here this weekend.
[46:46.60]He ain't poning like he used to.
[46:47.98]I found out why Melon wasn't on the server.
[46:52.69]It's because he just plunked down $100.
[46:54.89]Saying shout-outs to Obese, Lizzie, all the Jump community, as well as people who worked hard to put on this event.
[47:00.19]We also have Purple Pegway putting down a hundy.
[47:03.86]Saying shout-out to AI, Cat King, Fractal, Masley, Gorge, everyone else at Jump Academy.
[47:08.28]A lot of those guys right now are doing this race.
[47:10.53]Good luck to everyone jumping.
[47:11.69]Can't wait to see the Pipe Jump race.
[47:13.79]That sounds to me like Pipe Pipe.
[47:15.41]Pipe Pipe.
[47:16.11]And with those couple of hundies, we broke 130K.
[47:18.92]There we go.
[47:20.52]30K.
[47:21.84]Alright.
[47:22.38]Pipe pipe.
[47:23.66]We'll get the pipe pipe.
[47:25.86]The pipe pipe meter on screen maybe to sort of indicate where we're at.
[47:29.99]How much pipe pipe we have.
[47:30.93]Yeah, there's an Amber pipe pipe alert.
[47:33.35]What's up?
[47:34.70]Can't say that so aggressively.
[47:36.06]Pipe pipe.
[47:37.08]Pipe pipe.
[47:38.10]You guys see?
[47:38.74]Now you've got it.
[47:42.51]This jerf course looks really fun.
[47:44.71]It looks like they're implementing some syncs right at the end there.
[47:48.28]Yeah.
[47:48.90]There are a lot of strands on the course.
[47:50.84]It's really well done.
[47:51.86]Well, what I like about it is, I mean, Kurt is obviously a, you know, he's humble, but he's kind of a...
[47:57.78]Bit of a god at jumping.
[48:00.66]He's pretty darn good.
[48:01.90]Kurt's real good.
[48:02.62]He's been doing a lot longer than most people here.
[48:05.48]Mail is a great soldier as well.
[48:07.33]I do it on stream.
[48:09.53]I'm not garbage, but I'm just acceptable.
[48:12.29]But that's what I like about this map is that, and with the Jump Academy maps, is that it's all kind of levels.
[48:17.36]So, you know, Kurt can come and do quints and crazy stuff that I could never dream of.
[48:22.30]And, you know, I can do pogo or do, you know, whatever's my skill level.
[48:25.81]That's one of the cool things about jumping is, like, you think you can never dream of doing it.
[48:30.31]You see someone do some crazy jumps.
[48:32.45]Like, you watch jump above the last stage.
[48:34.58]It's like, I'll never beat this.
[48:36.04]You come back to it after a couple months of jumping, and it's, like, the easiest thing in the world, and it feels really good.
[48:40.95]It's true.
[48:41.29]It's all practice, isn't it, boys?
[48:43.79]Yeah, definitely.
[48:44.43]Oh, yeah.
[48:45.11]and we really wanted this map to be just the map we're gonna it's gonna go ramp all the way from tier one up to tier five out of six years and it's just gonna be if you want to learn any specific skill you got a map
[48:59.18]Yeah, that's what I like about it.
[49:00.69]I mean, you know, you can, like you said, the map, you know, it's got great longevity as you sort of develop.
[49:07.31]And it's one of those things where, you know, the more time you put into it.
[49:10.38]I mean, listen, a year ago, I could barely rocket jump at all.
[49:13.16]But, you know, every stream, I've just been doing a little bit, do it for an hour or two, and you start to really see improvement.
[49:19.67]I mean, I guess it's like any skill, certainly, but it's really cool that way.
[49:23.10]practice yeah definitely definitely takes a long time I mean most people in here have at least over a thousand hours in jumping like I know I have I don't know how much I have but I know it's an embarrassing amount I think 13 000 or something yeah like 27 000 hours wow that's nothing
[49:45.27]Well, we talk about it sometimes, and the thing that's so cool about it, and it's the thing that's cool about TF2 is that, you know, you have all those hours in TF2, but it's almost all jumping hours, isn't it?
[49:57.49]It's not like you have a whole ton of competitive and you have a whole ton of this and that.
[50:01.23]For most of you guys, it's mostly, you know, just doing jumping, is it not?
[50:07.30]With a couple exceptions, I'm sure.
[50:08.94]It changes from person to person.
[50:11.43]Yeah, absolutely.
[50:12.99]Like, I've strayed from jumping.
[50:14.57]Pardon?
[50:14.99]I've strayed from jumping, like, a bit, played maybe a little bit of competitive, but I always come back.
[50:19.69]Yeah, which is cool.
[50:20.88]It's just, like, the main thing that I love about this game is jumping, for sure.
[50:24.52]Yeah.
[50:25.12]We got a friend of yours, or a pal, or maybe a fan of yours here, Vexen Scotch, $101, saying, Heart Tempest, jump.tf, hashtag Vexen for admin 2016.
[50:36.01]Admin of what?
[50:37.43]What are they talking about there?
[50:39.56]Tempest, I don't know.
[50:41.38]I thought that was for the Jump TF forums or something.
[50:44.54]Yeah, it's kind of everywhere.
[50:46.43]I don't know.
[50:47.33]Vexen's quite the popular man.
[50:48.63]Yeah, my goodness.
[50:49.91]Some more callouts here.
[50:51.05]I love this.
[50:51.53]The Jump community's all just, like, coming all out in droves.
[50:54.06]We got Zyke with $30 saying, quote, I love anime, unquote.
[50:59.04]And Gato Shada to Crockett, Fractal, Gato, Shigetsu, Gorge, Seabird, Nat King, Mezzy, and all the other Tempest mains.
[51:07.22]$30.
[51:07.40]$30.
[51:08.40]Not bad.
[51:09.64]Yeah.
[51:10.80]Pipe Pipe.
[51:12.16]That's the end.
[51:12.84]Fishy won.
[51:13.76]That is a beautiful map.
[51:15.64]Well done, Fishy.
[51:17.69]That was great.
[51:19.97]I love that jerf part.
[51:21.01]The forest jerfing.
[51:23.09]Very nice.
[51:24.73]It's picturesque.
[51:26.02]What do we got coming up now?
[51:27.72]We got a map called Tom Brady.
[51:30.68]Tom Brady is my favorite football player.
[51:34.09]He's a quarterback, I believe.
[51:35.27]Is he not?
[51:36.97]Something like that.
[51:38.53]Touchdown!
[51:42.70]Pipe pipe.
[51:43.64]Maybe we try to get Tom Brady for this year.
[51:46.13]Are you there, Tom?
[51:47.91]Hello?
[51:49.92]We had him.
[51:50.40]We must have lost him.
[51:52.09]uh we got five adly or sadly 27.99 saying back at it again been excited for the jump segment this year we had a 30 anonymous donation saying shout out from jump academy to everyone a tip of the hat so thankful for our chance to be on stream and contribute looking forward to what's to come in the future thanks to ai vexen and everyone running the stream for putting this all together catch you around
[52:16.64]And that is anonymous.
[52:18.28]Some people don't want their name, but that's cool.
[52:19.91]A member of Jump Academy.
[52:21.25]A big old community, right, guys?
[52:23.60]Oh, yeah.
[52:24.08]Yeah.
[52:24.56]Tight knit.
[52:25.34]One big happy family.
[52:26.71]Yeah.
[52:27.35]That's cool.
[52:28.69]So this map's going to be my boy Rise and Jondi.
[52:32.64]Um, this is probably going to be the talk of the, uh, the jump stream.
[52:37.76]If the movie is.
[52:39.17]Oh boy.
[52:39.53]That's a big thing to claim.
[52:42.57]Tom Brady.
[52:43.39]This map is pretty, pretty crazy.
[52:46.76]Yeah.
[52:47.16]Tom, the guy.
[52:48.02]This is the first time it's ever been done before like this.
[52:50.71]This is the world like we're here.
[52:52.27]What does that like this?
[52:53.99]You're going to see it.
[52:56.60]Gravity set to 100.
[52:57.72]No, no.
[53:00.20]Alright.
[53:01.12]Play this on the screen.
[53:02.67]Are you trying to get us banned?
[53:04.31]Take the camera.
[53:06.35]And this is not safe for work.
[53:07.81]This map.
[53:08.99]Oh, no, no.
[53:09.68]I mean, we're not at work.
[53:13.20]So
[53:13.81]Oh, we're restarting the map, I guess.
[53:15.77]I think something went wrong.
[53:17.04]Well, tell us when you're ready.
[53:18.74]In the meantime, we got BAME Time, a.k.a.
[53:20.90]Jones Sausage, saying, Loving the three people on hosting the section.
[53:24.59]Had to give more because of the amazing, great jump community.
[53:28.28]Extra shout-out to Truck Truck for giving me the inspiration to start jumping.
[53:31.28]$100.
[53:32.28]Thank you, BAME Time.
[53:33.51]Thank you, BAME Time.
[53:35.09]I don't know how to say your name.
[53:36.35]I've only known you for like a year, but I don't know.
[53:37.87]liz the wiz plunking down another hundy thank you so much liz saying go fractal booty also hey devin nublet Simon kidder person and everyone else I love you can't name them all I guess you could try alright donate more donations more people you love you guys ready yeah I think they're ready um you guys want me to count down yeah we can't see the screen here we go okay oh it's a little dark one go
[54:06.51]We're not racing.
[54:08.35]We're not racing.
[54:08.79]But you guys are going to start at the same time.
[54:10.28]They love each other too much.
[54:12.40]We're just going to start off explaining some mechanics of this map just so you guys understand it better.
[54:19.51]Oh, boy.
[54:19.99]So these things that I'm looking at, they... No, this blue teleport, it makes it so that when you land on your rocket, it, like, propels you like that.
[54:34.64]Makes it so that it hits yourself.
[54:37.00]You airshot yourself.
[54:38.01]Yeah, you're basically airshotting yourself, and that's what this map is.
[54:41.43]If you know about the jump pads on the pastime maps, this is what that uses.
[54:47.40]Interesting.
[54:48.20]So that's a new thing.
[54:49.26]Yeah.
[54:50.84]It's like attached to the rocket.
[54:52.54]Also, these squares teleport your rockets through the blue teleports.
[54:57.53]So just try and bear with me.
[55:02.30]Hmm.
[55:03.44]And each shot.
[55:05.14]This is so cool.
[55:06.16]This is a new wrinkle in jumping air shotting yourself up.
[55:09.61]Yeah.
[55:10.47]Each level has like their own settings, if you will.
[55:14.39]Like this, this last job will propel you like a certain speed or, you know.
[55:22.30]But this one is just like fell down all the way.
[55:28.16]It's pretty fun.
[55:30.24]Sounds like it.
[55:31.88]Who was that?
[55:39.23]Besides yourself.
[55:41.68]That was a classic dude.
[55:47.13]Got him.
[55:48.00]So basically you're shooting the Rockets into the water that launches them back up into yourself So you air shot yourself and it looks like you have to avoid touching the ground That you're shooting the Rockets at this wild rocket doesn't go to the water, but Yeah So he's shooting now just to like kind of act as a timer like a stopwatch Because he's done this a million times.
[56:12.30]So I
[56:14.93]There you go.
[56:15.53]That's the speed.
[56:16.33]Oh, my.
[56:16.89]Where is he going?
[56:18.48]Alright.
[56:19.04]See you.
[56:19.50]To the moon, Ellis.
[56:21.12]Where'd my socks go?
[56:22.99]What I want to know is how is Ryze inspecting his regular festive rocket launcher?
[56:27.89]I guess it's a... You can do that?
[56:29.14]I'm cheating to you.
[56:29.76]That's all I can say.
[56:31.26]Wow.
[56:33.61]This is very interesting to me.
[56:34.75]I've never seen anything like this, honestly.
[56:41.27]Yeah, it's definitely a really cool idea.
[56:45.10]This is something that jumpers who have been doing it for years could be looking at this and saying, like, what in the hell is going on?
[56:52.01]Yeah.
[56:52.93]First time I saw it, I was amazed.
[56:54.41]Yeah.
[56:55.33]I don't know how B-Boogie did this.
[56:57.31]These two guys are really, really good at it, but everyone else is just as confused as everyone in the stream.
[57:03.66]So this one, they're shooting at that little square there, and when they walk forward, they just teleport to that square and fall down.
[57:08.39]They're trying to hit themselves.
[57:11.02]There you go, right?
[57:12.97]Got him, dude.
[57:14.31]Alright.
[57:14.53]So for this one, you want to watch on the right hand side or left side and shoot through the square.
[57:18.29]You're going to straight back onto your rocket.
[57:20.50]So a little bit like this.
[57:25.94]What?
[57:26.74]Yeah, I just love all the rockets are like pointing the wrong direction.
[57:31.71]Yeah.
[57:32.41]What?
[57:34.37]What?
[57:35.64]Yeah, that's just first tried it.
[57:38.98]both did that was wow my mom my brain I don't know what I'm seeing alright so for this one you're gonna do four wall shots on the right hand side and there's gonna be like a little square that pops up that I need to shoot through and I'm gonna catch my rocket when it comes out it's not what happens when I get an air shot
[58:03.35]Well, is it because does it have to do with the fact that it has to do with how far away you are when you fire the rocket, doesn't it?
[58:10.78]Something like that.
[58:12.77]Oh, no, it's just that the launch pads that are attached to the rockets all have different settings.
[58:17.19]Oh, so they speed.
[58:18.28]OK, gotcha.
[58:19.64]Yeah, it's different for every job.
[58:20.92]It's special, like to the job.
[58:22.46]Yeah.
[58:24.21]It's it's blowing us away.
[58:27.07]It's so goofy looking.
[58:31.55]Is this the only map that kind of makes use of this so far, or are there efforts to kind of put this onto more maps?
[58:38.16]This is the only one so far, and I kind of hope it stays that way.
[58:41.73]Yeah?
[58:43.61]How come?
[58:44.45]Just to make it unique?
[58:47.12]I guess, yeah.
[58:48.36]He might make another one.
[58:49.38]He's in mumble.
[58:50.16]He's just not talking.
[58:51.56]I'm watering my dog right now.
[58:55.35]Oh, okay, good.
[58:57.62]Yeah, I'm making another one right now.
[59:00.61]Just got the hose in the living room.
[59:02.98]Dog's in a little kiddie pool.
[59:04.43]Don't worry about that.
[59:05.19]We've all been there, watering our dogs.
[59:08.96]Yeah, you know how it goes, dude.
[59:10.81]Yeah.
[59:11.51]Tom Brady.
[59:12.55]We got more Pipe Pipe Beanie with $10 saying, Pipe Pipe.
[59:15.88]Pipe Pipe.
[59:16.64]Pipe Pipe.
[59:18.22]We got Elk $30 saying, shout out to Zyke for not shouting me out.
[59:22.71]SMH, my hecking head.
[59:24.77]Come on, no shout out?
[59:26.49]Poor Elk.
[59:27.62]Poor guy.
[59:28.80]Gibbous donates $100 and says, RTV.
[59:32.17]Dangerous.
[59:35.35]I love this.
[59:36.77]Sal had put down 30 bucks, said congrats to Fishy on winning the race.
[59:39.88]Can't wait for that new map of Jump Academy.
[59:42.52]Seeing lots of new faces on the servers after Tip of the Hats.
[59:45.92]We will be doing that and making sure to give the details on how people can go and start jumping themselves.
[59:51.53]We'll do that when we're all set here.
[59:52.89]What's up, Jay Dizzle?
[59:54.84]Oh, yeah.
[59:55.18]So this is my personal favorite jump.
[59:57.88]So we'll see.
[59:59.96]You got to catch up to your rocket.
[60:01.71]And I suck at it.
[60:05.70]You got this, Jay Dizzler.
[60:08.31]There it is.
[60:09.41]Wow.
[60:10.43]Nice.
[60:11.55]And this one's probably definitely the hardest.
[60:14.40]Someone's excited.
[60:15.46]Bye-bye.
[60:16.18]Outiful.
[60:17.36]Sorry.
[60:18.52]This one is intense.
[60:20.87]Yeah, this one's pretty gnarly.
[60:23.09]So I'm supposed to like this rocket right here.
[60:27.06]I land on that rocket.
[60:29.06]I go to that ramp and then I shoot off that ramp and then my rocket right here.
[60:35.45]You'll see.
[60:35.85]It's pretty.
[60:37.93]I'll take your word for it.
[60:42.21]Just let it happen.
[60:47.70]So seem incredibly difficult.
[60:49.30]Yeah.
[60:51.82]I mean, for me, there are certain jump maps you get on and it takes you a minute or two to look and figure out what you're supposed to do.
[60:59.44]I can't imagine... You told me and I still don't know.
[61:02.63]Yeah, exactly.
[61:03.73]Trying to make heads or tails of this.
[61:05.57]This is beyond... That actually isn't that hard.
[61:11.78]I think it's just Jandy's first time.
[61:13.82]Oh, okay.
[61:14.48]Yeah, yeah.
[61:15.66]Ouch.
[61:17.24]Roasted, dude.
[61:18.88]Let's get some Toth Roasted in the chat now.
[61:21.05]Toth Roast!
[61:23.83]Troasted.
[61:24.57]Troast.
[61:25.85]Oh, so close.
[61:26.73]I don't know which one is mine.
[61:33.46]I don't know which one is mine either.
[61:35.21]Slash hide, am I right?
[61:41.39]Alright.
[61:41.61]Take it easy on us.
[61:44.09]Maybe now would be a good time to read off some donations while these two struggle on this.
[61:47.30]Yeah, let's do that.
[61:48.80]No offense, guys.
[61:49.58]We've got Zed, 30 bucks.
[61:51.78]Hey, guys.
[61:52.50]Taunt is one of the events I look forward to every year.
[61:55.31]Sorry, boy.
[61:56.99]He said fish here.
[61:57.91]He's got the fish.

[65:06.31]Boy, I love this pipe pipe.
[65:07.73]Guys, that incentive, that's what we're talking about.
[65:09.65]We're not just like having brain problems.
[65:13.14]A little bit of both.
[65:15.18]Well, we've always had some problems in the brain.
[65:17.31]But everybody's special.
[65:19.29]The pipe pipe is our incentive, which you see flashing on screen and whatnot.
[65:22.52]We want to do some of that pipe.
[65:24.16]hype hype some of this pipe launcher jumps yep uh we want to see them and we know that a lot of people do too don't let us down the thing is unfortunately the jumping segment won't be lasting all day while we're here yeah absolutely gotta donate fast and a lot right now and a lot
[65:44.88]What's up?
[65:45.34]If we switch maps here, we're just looking at ourselves.
[65:48.39]What's the name of the map?
[65:49.51]Oh, we're in here.
[65:50.33]We're in.
[65:51.29]Jump Forward to Kids is the name.
[65:53.07]Yeah, Jump Forward to Kids.
[65:54.45]Oh, that's amazing.
[65:55.70]Love that.
[65:56.10]2016.
[65:57.00]Yeah, this is named exactly for this event.
[66:00.92]This map is gorgeous.
[66:03.20]Oh, yeah.
[66:04.16]Oh, yeah.
[66:05.41]How many people submitted jumps for this?
[66:07.03]I don't know.
[66:07.67]Kendrick's not in here.
[66:09.61]A decent amount.
[66:11.69]Before this gets chaotic, I'm just going to count it down.
[66:14.74]before people start doing the map.
[66:16.20]Yep.
[66:21.11]Alright, go.
[66:23.69]That was a pain.
[66:24.75]Alright.
[66:26.05]We are off.
[66:27.28]We got some ASMR going on with the rockets here.
[66:31.34]Yeah, boys, give me the tinglies.
[66:34.89]I got goose pimples.
[66:38.59]Let's get all these people.
[66:39.98]We don't know where they're going.
[66:43.79]This is pretty nutty.
[66:47.48]We had more donations just all flooding in.
[66:50.08]People love jumping the same as we do.
[66:52.91]Corny put down a one hundo saying hashtag for the kids jump for life.
[66:58.07]Why we?
[66:58.87]$111.
[67:02.92]It says great show, great cause.
[67:05.78]They had a call to action for Twitch chat that I'm going to omit from the comments.
[67:09.03]Sorry.
[67:10.07]You can't just tell Twitch chat to do dumb stuff.
[67:13.67]Even if you're donating to charity.
[67:16.02]It's not how this works.
[67:17.56]Joint Census put down $30.
[67:19.46]It's amazing to see the jump limits being pushed each year.
[67:22.35]Shout out to AI and Nolum helping keep the community alive.
[67:25.31]Everyone who supports East Coast Jumpers, Liz especially.
[67:29.60]We've seen Liz already putting down big dollars and cents.
[67:35.32]Ooh.
[67:36.44]A little head check at the end there.
[67:38.29]Yeah.
[67:39.25]Kendrick in the... No, we got a couple people here.
[67:41.87]I think the plugin's not configured for this map because it's super secret.
[67:45.89]Secret.
[67:46.41]Super secret.
[67:47.79]Yeah, that's actually a problem.
[67:50.03]We did have it, I think, zoned, but I'm not sure what happened.
[67:53.84]Well, that's okay.
[67:55.06]We can get the status updates here.
[67:56.58]We got Renew making his way through, looking at Gibbous here now as well.
[68:00.93]There's a Marketplace TF ad that somehow managed to get itself onto this map.
[68:06.06]Wow.
[68:07.66]Cheaper than the Steam Market.
[68:08.38]I'm sure Jill's pumped about that.
[68:10.92]Not a singular trade hold in history either.
[68:13.07]There never will be one.
[68:13.87]The least.
[68:15.49]I think Gibbous is in the lead here.
[68:18.00]Yeah, Gibbous and Ryze.
[68:19.74]I think that's who it is.
[68:21.48]We got Minto as well.
[68:22.64]Yeah, we're a little behind on the cam here, like four or five jumps behind.
[68:26.60]There we go.
[68:28.47]Oh.
[68:28.99]Gibbous as well, a name that we know from last year was here doing the jump as well, back again.
[68:35.35]Something about that jumping that you stick with it as long as you can.
[68:38.98]People never quite leave.
[68:41.63]Yeah, that's a problem.
[68:44.20]That's okay.
[68:45.64]That is okay.
[68:46.68]We got Waste came through with $25, has now donated more than he probably should have, he says, as a student, but we appreciate it.
[68:55.25]RetroServers.net, $100.
[68:57.63]Shout out to AI and Jump Academy.
[68:59.29]It's been an honor hosting your servers free of charge.
[69:02.82]Look forward to our continued relations.
[69:04.58]That sounds like a pretty good deal.
[69:06.59]Pretty good.
[69:07.35]Yeah.
[69:07.51]Good.
[69:08.21]Pretty good.
[69:08.83]Good.
[69:09.28]Nairo or Nero.
[69:10.46]10 bucks.
[69:11.02]Great event, guys.
[69:11.80]Hashtag pipe pipe.
[69:13.34]Pipe pipe.
[69:14.26]If that's the Nairo that made Omnific and Unicorn, shoutouts to him.
[69:18.15]Yeah.
[69:18.53]Wow.
[69:19.37]That's cool.
[69:19.84]He's moving on.
[69:20.44]I think Super Chuck's taking the lead.
[69:26.37]You guys really like that second jump, Cam.
[69:29.89]Getting a real good taste of the first two jumps here.
[69:38.01]Jababa's doing some different stuff.
[69:39.78]Here we go.
[69:41.28]Boy, oh boy.
[69:42.08]Tasty.
[69:43.32]Oh, that's good.
[69:48.12]That's only when you donate items we get to do the cool sound effects on stream.
[69:52.15]We're at $132,000 in terms of donations, but they're still pouring in.
[69:54.96]$111.11, and do you know what they call that?
[70:00.19]a quint rock rocchio says here's a perfect quint on behalf of jump tf and although we all know that hats equals skill and jumping you still need somewhere to show off those new skills so check out the community thanks to everyone involved making the jump community great and of course to all the people who work so hard to make taunt the success every year hashtag save the jumpers hashtag for the kids hashtag
[70:22.90]I thought you guys were going to catch on there.
[70:27.05]Too slow.
[70:27.87]Too slow.
[70:28.13]Nice Quint there.
[70:29.09]Thank you for the Quint and the $111.
[70:30.73]That's what they call it.
[70:33.64]20 bucks from Lifted Please, Kurt.
[70:35.76]This is for my Trailblazer.
[70:37.18]Trailblazer cane.
[70:38.23]My Trailblazer pin saying someone tell Kurt Lifted Please misses him.
[70:43.23]Give you all a nice donation.
[70:45.14]Unusual, too.
[70:47.23]That's fantastic.
[70:48.25]We appreciate the item donations.
[70:49.82]We're trying to get through as much as we can.
[70:51.62]If I can interject real quick here.
[70:53.74]If the jumpers could tell us who is in the lead because the production is... It's Super Chuck, I think.
[70:59.13]Super Chuck.
[70:59.85]Let's get him.
[71:01.87]He's killing the map right now.
[71:04.55]Lifted Please also says this is a great cause.
[71:06.44]Plus, is Getaway all single?
[71:08.76]Winky face.
[71:10.94]That's an interesting question.
[71:13.67]I'm sure we'll answer that at some point.
[71:16.48]This one looks a little confusing.
[71:19.28]Yeah, this one's... I think it's just wall shots.
[71:21.90]Oh, okay.
[71:22.35]This is my jump.
[71:23.19]Yeah, it's just wall shots.
[71:26.05]Just wall shots?
[71:27.35]That's no attitude to have.
[71:29.11]Wall shots are amazing.
[71:30.04]Just gotta go over this giant wall.
[71:32.26]Gotta go for a massive wall and then get around the head check.
[71:36.18]Oh, no.
[71:36.38]Yeah.
[71:36.87]The awning's covering the platform there.
[71:39.23]The head checks sometimes get me as well because I have such a big head.
[71:43.13]Yeah.
[71:44.36]Six head.
[71:45.81]Six head.
[71:46.35]Can we get some six heads in chat, by the way?
[71:49.55]You might have heard of four heads.
[71:51.15]You might have even heard of five heads.
[71:53.90]Get a whale with the six head.
[71:56.04]I'll get it now.
[71:58.52]I wasn't following.
[71:59.30]I'm sorry.
[71:59.68]I'm a little slow.
[72:00.68]Little slow.
[72:01.66]That's okay.
[72:02.71]Oh, that's the one.
[72:03.73]There it is.
[72:05.21]Barely had the strength at all.
[72:06.59]That was good.
[72:07.49]He just busted that jump.
[72:10.29]I like the aesthetic of these jumps.
[72:12.33]It's like bluish and purplish.
[72:14.20]Yeah, well.
[72:15.28]I like that.
[72:15.64]It's clean I like that it you know it uses the snow and cliffs and whatnot But it doesn't look cheap like some maybe older maps or whatever.
[72:22.33]It's a nice look to it for the kids for the kids
[72:29.28]Mike, if you want to go into how to donate with items and maybe other possible donation ways you can donate for the kids.
[72:37.75]Yes, let's do that.
[72:38.93]And actually, we can read out some of those donations as well.
[72:41.87]Of course, you guys all certainly know if you've watched in the past that you can donate using money through PayPal or whatever.
[72:51.20]But first time ever, you can donate items now through Scrap TF.
[72:55.93]They will get converted to cash directly
[72:58.89]I'm going to take a sip of water.
[73:00.92]That's what I'm going to do.
[73:02.92]But the items will get converted to cash.
[73:05.39]These include Australian weapons of all sorts, keys, tickets, as well as unusuals.
[73:12.38]They will get converted straight to cash.
[73:14.37]Right in one step.
[73:16.59]And that's what we do when you donate with items, so go ahead and do that.
[73:19.38]And it goes straight to the charity.
[73:20.88]We have, for example, Lifted Please.
[73:22.40]It just plopped down an unusual that was mentioned.
[73:24.59]$81 worth.
[73:26.45]Hey, hey, hey.
[73:27.29]Had an all-class unusual bring a hole in my backpack, so I thought I'd give it to a good cause.
[73:32.76]And also, of course, mentioned Miss Kurt.
[73:36.10]Just Mrs. Kurt.
[73:37.27]I'll be back home soon.
[73:38.87]You're a great kid.
[73:39.83]Thank you.
[73:40.21]You're a good kid.
[73:42.47]But yeah, a lot of people putting down stuff.
[73:44.38]Donating an unusual of $63 was my back.
[73:48.98]Friend of my neck, probably.
[73:50.58]Chewy donated an unusual.
[73:51.93]$26.59.
[73:53.29]Lazarus, five keys, worth $10.
[73:55.79]So guys, you know, there's no such thing as too small of a donation.
[73:58.52]And I think there are some people that have unusuals that are kind of...
[74:02.24]I don't know if you want to say burning a hole in their backpack.
[74:05.36]Collecting dust.
[74:05.72]Yeah, I mean, you might not wear often, or maybe you don't play TF2 as much.
[74:09.35]A lot of people have been doing that, which is fantastic.
[74:11.45]Go and scour those backpacks.
[74:13.19]Yep.
[74:14.21]There might be a key hidden on page 8 with all of your Righteous Bisons.
[74:18.24]Check page 8.
[74:19.30]Make sure to check page 8.
[74:20.66]Yep.
[74:21.78]So we're looking at Super Chuck here still, making his way downtown.
[74:25.65]Walking fast.
[74:27.86]So how long did it take for this map to be made?
[74:29.84]It's very high quality.
[74:31.25]The texturing is beautiful.
[74:32.97]Yeah, it is.
[74:34.67]It was made by like 20 people.
[74:36.96]So it's all distributed work.
[74:39.59]Okay.
[74:40.93]I think I spent like five hours on my jumps.
[74:44.58]So people would make a jump, and then they gave them all to one person, Kendrick, and he put all of them together.
[74:51.93]Yeah.
[74:52.55]That's kind of a change, too, because I know from some older maps, like, it's always been a community where people would put, they would name jumps after their friends, but I think more and more now in kind of modern-ish times, if you want to call it that, it's like everyone's making the actual jumps and putting them together.
[75:10.00]We talked about it a year ago during Tip of the Hats where everyone's kind of
[75:13.60]contributing to make this big super map right collab maps have been around for a while but yeah they definitely they feel like they have been more common in recent years for some for whatever reason people have the more experience and they're kind of learning more and more which is cool yeah that too yeah yeah who was super shocked with the wall bug say yeah I saw that man that was pretty gnarly
[75:36.07]$50 from an unusual donation from Moo, who says, and get this, donating for that hunk on the couch, Mela.
[75:44.48]But in all seriousness, I love Toth so much.
[75:48.03]It's such a great cause.
[75:49.09]By the way, do you know what?
[75:52.16]I think that we can make it on the pipe launcher jump race.
[75:54.76]Do you know why?
[75:55.35]I mean, we've made...
[75:56.57]We're skyrocketing up here.
[75:58.01]We'll get a live count on the screen in a moment.
[75:59.82]Yeah, we're coming up on 6,000 for it.
[76:02.55]We can do it.
[76:03.95]Pipe hype.
[76:04.99]This is not a pipe dream.
[76:08.40]It's a pipe pipe.
[76:10.10]This is real.
[76:11.92]This is pipe reality.
[76:13.97]All the air just flew out of my lungs on my mouth.
[76:18.73]100 bucks came down from Apollyon Abaddon.
[76:23.50]$100 says hi, truck truck.
[76:25.59]Hi!
[76:26.81]There you go.
[76:27.43]You got your answer.
[76:27.91]Wow.
[76:28.03]Thank you for the donation.
[76:28.65]We really are soaring up the pipe.
[76:29.83]Hi, smiley face.
[76:31.20]I feel like I said 5,000 just 27 seconds ago, and it's already at 6.
[76:35.43]It is.
[76:35.69]Let's go.
[76:36.01]And we're at 37 seconds ago now.
[76:36.87]Keep it going.
[76:37.57]Pipe, pipe.
[76:38.21]If you are part of this, you can feel real good.
[76:41.12]And if you guys didn't see, there was one pipe launcher jump in the initial video that set off the segment.
[76:47.91]Yep.
[76:47.97]One time I saw it and I was like, yeah, well, we need to hit that incentive because that was really cool.
[76:51.86]That could be an opportunity to plug a YouTube channel.
[76:54.44]Do you guys know where that is going to be hosted after this event, if it's not already on YouTube?
[77:00.37]It's for sure going to be on the YouTube channel TF2RJWeekly, which I'm sure someone's going to spam in chat now.
[77:07.62]Yeah, do you want to tell us a bit about that?
[77:09.54]What kind of stuff you can find on TF2RJWeekly, guys?
[77:12.33]I know you like to plug that a lot.
[77:15.37]Tort started it, so I'll let him talk.
[77:17.28]Yeah, I can do a little bit about it.
[77:19.02]So me and Afterglow, me being Tort, we started that channel, I think, four years ago now, or three years ago.
[77:25.19]And we had this idea of once a week we had the best jump that we got submitted, and once a week we had the best speedrun we got submitted.
[77:33.09]And we just put music over it, put it up on the channel, and...
[77:37.60]It's still happening.
[77:38.42]We're at, I think, jump of the week 5,000 or something like that.
[77:43.02]It's been a while.
[77:43.71]Wow.
[77:43.81]That's been around for somewhere.
[77:46.11]YouTube.com.
[77:47.05]That is a high number.
[77:48.93]They also have some jump videos or jump movies.
[77:51.97]I mean, not jump videos.
[77:54.68]Movies and videos.
[77:55.56]You can find them both.
[77:56.66]TF2RJWeekly.com.
[77:59.08]Like the one you saw earlier.
[78:02.51]You should go to tf2rjweekly.com.
[78:04.55]That would be just a neat way.
[78:05.73].net as well, .org, whatever you could get.
[78:09.22]Just sort of reserve them just in case.
[78:11.34]You don't know what those sites are, man.
[78:12.62]It could be a bunch of viruses.
[78:14.08]You never know.
[78:14.86]Don't go to them, then.
[78:16.29]Get a virus scanner.
[78:19.07]Pick up Norton's, yeah.
[78:22.96]We had Julian Eisenbraun, 20 bucks, says, Sad I missed most of the stream, but glad I could make it to the jump part, my favorite one.
[78:30.79]Thanks to everyone who helped out with this favorite stream of the year.
[78:35.27]Definitely.
[78:36.52]Thank you.
[78:36.88]$30 from DBZ Gohan.
[78:39.20]Heart the jump community.
[78:40.76]Hype for Dota Fortress.
[78:41.78]That'll be coming, of course, later on today.
[78:43.92]We're in the jump now, right now.
[78:45.77]Anonymous, $30.
[78:47.03]Greeting from Sweden.
[78:48.41]My second year watching, and I'll continue watching this year.
[78:51.09]Really liked Jacob's story earlier.
[78:52.96]Also, jump hype.
[78:55.06]No, it's type hype.
[78:56.40]You weren't listening.
[78:57.32]Okay.
[78:59.19]Pipe Pipe!
[79:01.63]It's Pipe Pipe.
[79:02.96]Get on board.
[79:05.67]How's the race going here?
[79:06.57]We're still on the Super Chuck cam.
[79:08.15]Who we got in second place?
[79:09.25]This is a pretty hard map.
[79:10.84]You're struggling with this jump.
[79:11.96]Yeah, well, this jump looks pretty finicky, but it's very pretty.
[79:16.10]It's a nice little broken bridge.
[79:18.80]Yeah, that ramp, you can actually shoot off that, and then you have to do a triple rocket catch on top of the rock at the end.
[79:25.71]Oh, that sounds easy enough.
[79:28.19]It's pretty crazy.
[79:29.74]You do that all the time.
[79:30.90]yep don't uh don't drink the water you know rembo 190 dollars brought to you by pipe pipe love the jump segment every year says mini 20 yeah eat it up eat it up eat it
[79:46.24]Get it in there.
[79:46.98]Get it into you.
[79:48.02]Camper says, I look forward to tip of the hats every year.
[79:50.20]Thanks for all you do.
[79:51.12]Big hundo bucks.
[79:52.49]I hope these are all going into where the pipe hype incentive.
[79:55.57]Look at that.
[79:55.93]We're at about $6,000.
[79:57.49]Keep it coming.
[79:58.60]Another $70 one.
[80:00.00]They're flying hot and heavy.
[80:02.88]Airbus A380.
[80:04.52]That's what I flew here on, an airplane.
[80:07.23]Airbus.
[80:08.97]I think SuperChuck's approaching the stage.
[80:11.41]Oh, SuperChuck.
[80:12.21]Oh, he found the strat.
[80:13.33]That is the strat.
[80:14.69]Well done.
[80:15.13]Much easier.
[80:15.88]Got him.
[80:16.34]Can we shout out some other names?
[80:17.40]Like who we got second and third place?
[80:19.02]Do we have any idea?
[80:21.28]Beats me, dude.
[80:22.34]I don't know.
[80:22.76]I think this is there somewhere.
[80:24.27]There's people.
[80:27.57]You guys didn't give up yet on the server?
[80:29.85]You guys didn't give up just because we were looking at SuperChuck at home.
[80:32.42]There's one jump that a lot of people are on.
[80:34.83]I think it's NOM.
[80:36.21]That's the letters that I'm seeing.
[80:37.51]And there's like half the servers on there.
[80:40.38]You can see them in the top left corner.
[80:41.98]Yeah, you can see the outlines very faintly.
[80:45.53]Thanks, Val, for that feature.
[80:48.72]That's cool.
[80:49.14]I kind of like this one where you go into a little circle and jerk around.
[80:52.64]Yeah, the toilet bowl.
[80:54.48]I like that idea, though.
[80:55.92]I'm always blown away.
[80:56.80]We said it right off the top when we saw the video, but the creativity of the map makers and the jumpers, it's really cool.
[81:04.69]Mazily, just watering the dog, maybe?
[81:07.66]Yeah.
[81:07.78]Geist is there.
[81:08.88]We had a message, or maybe I skipped that one.
[81:11.40]There was someone that said something about Geist.
[81:14.08]I skipped it.
[81:14.83]How dumb is that?
[81:15.97]I didn't think he was there.
[81:16.87]I don't think that's the actual Geist.
[81:19.65]No?
[81:20.59]Is that one of the many impersonators?
[81:23.03]He's a Rocket League guy now.
[81:25.30]Oh, boy.
[81:26.24]Boo.
[81:26.76]10 bucks from Fagrid saying, known Chuck in real life for eight years.
[81:33.09]Can't believe he's winning.
[81:34.27]I don't know if that's an insult or a compliment.
[81:38.77]I know him as a loser, but he's winning right now.
[81:42.96]$15 anonymous.
[81:44.64]Hashtag pipe hype.
[81:46.33]We got our pal Drummer Kid who put down 20 and said, how much pipe could a pipe pipe pipe if a pipe pipe could hype pipe?
[81:54.18]That's a really fantastic question.
[81:55.62]We'll get to the bottom of that later on.
[81:57.86]What is this stage?
[81:59.21]This jump that Super Chaka's on is blowing my mind.
[82:02.09]What is this?
[82:02.57]This is an exile jump.
[82:04.07]Yeah.
[82:05.07]Exile does crazy stuff like this a lot.
[82:07.80]But really confusing, so it's not really the best for... There's no way this could be possible.
[82:12.59]He got it.
[82:14.36]He got it.
[82:14.74]Oh, yeah.
[82:15.12]What?
[82:15.24]Hey.
[82:15.52]Hi.
[82:16.16]What?
[82:17.80]Yeah, go down the hole.
[82:19.01]Don't jump off the edge.
[82:20.49]If you blink for a second, you miss it.
[82:23.01]Alright.
[82:23.25]This is the last.
[82:24.26]I think Chuck might take it.
[82:27.28]It has a door.
[82:28.70]Chuck testing.
[82:29.92]I like doors.
[82:32.33]Tell us more about that, Kirk.
[82:40.47]I'm going to just read this.
[82:42.35]I shouldn't.
[82:42.86]It's not, you know, it's not, just don't.
[82:45.48]It's not, it's appropriate.
[82:47.18]It's just weird, but it'll make people laugh.
[82:49.22]$30 from Keplar says, where is Lang at?
[82:53.03]I'm serious.
[82:53.77]I wanted to get into professional squatting and I need to see Lang's beautiful squatting posture.
[82:58.70]I need to see him strut his hips like a dog being watered because it was covered in pipe pipe.
[83:04.15]There you go.
[83:04.73]Some people are wacky.
[83:05.75]That's very relevant to a lot of recent saying.
[83:09.65]Life, yeah.
[83:11.64]SuperChunk, you killed it.
[83:12.76]You're feeling it.
[83:13.36]That is Wheaties today.
[83:15.82]Well done.
[83:16.50]And here we have a list of all of the map makers except... Oh, no, I am on there.
[83:22.23]I thought you said that I wasn't on there.
[83:24.33]When you get to the end of the map, it's important to look at your own name on the credits when you get to the end.
[83:29.50]That's the only thing that matters, you know?
[83:31.10]Yeah.
[83:33.07]Who's in second place?
[83:34.95]Who's furthest along?
[83:35.88]Do we know here who's in second?
[83:37.14]We can maybe get on their camera.
[83:40.14]I'm gonna guess Geist.
[83:42.11]No.
[83:43.85]Do we have any other maps planned?
[83:45.71]I think we do have another half hour to go as well, so we got some time for the Pipe Hype.
[83:52.25]We're laughing.
[83:54.42]Pipe.
[83:55.56]I think we're going to jump Ultra next.
[83:58.02]Okay.
[83:58.72]By the way, speaking of Pipe Pipe, NotRickFlame donated 10 bucks and said, hashtag Pipe Pipe.
[84:03.69]$100 from Mice, M-M-Y-S.
[84:07.70]I hope I'm saying that right.
[84:10.00]Which said, of course, Pipe Pipe.
[84:12.19]Easy to predict what that would have said.
[84:13.91]Well, I'm bringing it along.
[84:15.23]Thank you guys for donating for the Pipe Pipe.
[84:17.10]We are bringing it along.
[84:17.96]Guys, remember, that's our incentive for the Pipe Launcher jumping.
[84:21.32]We're running out of time here.
[84:22.94]I don't... I think we can get there.
[84:25.33]I think we can get there.
[84:26.65]fight.
[84:26.99]I think we can.

[84:42.62]I have no idea why you guys are laughing.
[84:44.16]I think Mela has a crush on Pissy here.
[84:46.18]Oh yeah?
[84:46.96]That must be it.
[84:48.31]Aww.
[84:48.37]5-5-5-5-5-0 dollars, also known as 50, from T Reynolds.

[84:59.38]Shout out to Vexen, Cody, Brock, Mellon, and Aurora.
[85:04.19]Another $30 Pipe Pipe love from an anonymous donor.
[85:08.15]This is great, guys.
[85:08.95]Keep it coming in.
[85:10.69]If it helps, the pipe map is actually a custom map.
[85:15.82]Well, it's not a custom map, but the map maker took the map and cut out most of it and made a special version just for tip of the hats.
[85:24.54]And the end of the map has a little surprise.
[85:27.58]We got to do that.
[85:29.94]That's some crucial information.
[85:31.21]Where are we at?
[85:32.39]We got 6434.
[85:33.37]Oh, come on, guys.
[85:35.37]You can do it.

[87:49.55]There's so many people involved.
[87:51.78]42 has donated $100.
[87:53.66]No message.
[87:55.54]We're getting there, boys and girls.
[87:57.39]Is the camera here?
[87:58.97]Let's get the camera.
[87:59.49]I hear some people high-fiving, so we are... We have the audio.
[88:03.58]Get your cameras ready.
[88:04.52]Get your cameras ready.
[88:05.76]We got RNC in here as well.
[88:07.64]We want to run down the names.
[88:08.66]Do you have a list of names who were racing here?
[88:11.04]It's just Super Chuck and Walrex, I believe.
[88:16.12]Walrex.
[88:16.54]Okay, RNT just wanted that camera time, that's all.
[88:19.80]Yeah, exactly.
[88:20.73]Let's see what's playing on this map.
[88:22.69]Alright, we'll take it away, guys.
[88:24.29]Alright, you guys ready?
[88:25.77]Yeah, just looking at this beautiful no-draw here from the best mapper, Shunix.
[88:29.81]Alright.
[88:31.84]We'll hit it whenever you guys are ready.
[88:33.50]Alright, Walrex, let's jump in together into the unknown.
[88:37.28]Is this the portal, Germituk?
[88:40.67]We'll find out.
[88:42.19]Sorry, he wasn't in.
[88:44.19]3, 2, 1.
[88:47.68]So this is Jump Ultra made by Shunix.
[88:50.58]I think it was made for Beginnings 2 or 1.
[88:56.53]The first Beginnings speedrunning competition.
[88:59.25]Yeah, could you say what that is real quick?
[89:02.23]I know we mentioned it last year and talked about what it is, but that's a competition.
[89:05.86]What's the nature of it?
[89:08.24]Basically what we've done in the past is we just get like... Well, the first year we did six maps, we just had six mapmakers make a brand new map that nobody had played before.
[89:17.97]And then we just gave everybody one week on every map to just get the best speedrun that they could.
[89:23.14]And then whoever won, won.
[89:26.01]And in the past two years, we've just dropped it down to only three maps.
[89:29.62]But it's still a very exciting time.
[89:32.14]It's very hype.
[89:32.86]It's amazing.
[89:34.28]Pipe pipe, maybe.
[89:35.27]Yeah, just new maps for the community and just another thing for high-level jumpers to work at.
[89:41.05]It's really fun to watch on YouTube and participate even as a lesser-skilled jumper as myself.
[89:47.54]It's just fun to have new maps, and Beginnings does just that.
[89:52.05]always so in awe and just like almost jealous of how like cool the jump community is and that's I'm not trying to like suck uh be sucky suck up or whatever but sure it's cool I mean you have all these events you have yeah you know pipe pipe uh can I get some cool cats and cats yeah cool cats
[90:12.10]I said suck too many times.
[90:13.56]It came out wrong.
[90:14.91]I was trying to say suck up, but I just stuttered.
[90:17.65]I have a problem, Kurt.
[90:19.02]I'm crying now.
[90:19.84]Cucumbers.
[90:20.22]Inside I am.
[90:21.28]But no, I mean, just all these cool events and how tight-knit it is.
[90:24.27]Guys, we're at $6,300.
[90:27.84]out of that 10 grand.
[90:28.96]Might be even a little higher here.
[90:30.29]We had an unusual donation, I believe, $47 from Strex, $46 from D Burger Chef.
[90:37.16]There's a new giveaway posted, by the way, but don't worry about that.
[90:39.62]We're doing Pipe Pipe right now.
[90:41.52]But there is a giveaway to be aware of, and those giveaways are free.
[90:45.77]We got some more Pipe Pipe donations.
[90:47.41]$5 from Hungry Monkey, Pipe Pipe.
[90:50.82]Chesham, $100, says Pipe Pipe.

[91:02.57]Shout out to Thunder Chunky and Ed Rofflington.
[91:05.84]Ed LMAOington.
[91:07.46]Mile High Tech put down a 20, said, Hey guys, love the event.

[91:31.66]Oh, my God.
[91:33.29]This is a pretty jump.

[91:58.69]That's $30 more.
[92:01.12]Another $30 anonymous.
[92:02.42]I work with kids, love kids.
[92:03.76]Let us make them happy.
[92:05.08]Worth mentioning, even though we have Pipe Hype and we'll get treated for it later,
[92:08.45]But this is all going to One Step Camp.
[92:10.21]That is a charity.
[92:11.02]It is for the kids.
[92:12.34]This is not for us.
[92:13.24]It's not for the jumpers.
[92:14.12]It's not for anyone.
[92:15.32]We're just real lucky to have this great event happening right now.
[92:18.33]And you can see it all there.
[92:20.43]Jenny, $10, sorry.
[92:23.78]Shout out to the jumpers for being insanely skilled.
[92:25.86]Hashtag pipe hype.
[92:27.89]I mean, the pipe hype, it's flooding me out here.
[92:30.41]There's been a stack overflow.
[92:31.97]Tactician, please donate to the Pipe Pipe, guys.
[92:34.64]It's for the kids and save the jumpers.
[92:37.31]Twiku, $19.

[92:40.76]Also, are you holding W?
[92:42.54]Shout out to Ed Boringby.
[92:45.17]Hmm.
[92:46.25]Interesting.

[92:48.25]100k.
[92:48.74]Yeah, guys.
[92:49.24]Make sure not to hold W. We hit 7k on the Pipe Pipe.
[92:53.00]We got... Let's see.
[92:54.68]Kevin Ispone put a dollar.
[92:56.01]He says, Donating $1.
[92:57.47]Because if everyone donated $1 right now, we'd reach the incentive.
[93:01.33]Let's go.
[93:01.65]There you go, guys.
[93:02.22]That's a great way to put it, guys.
[93:04.20]$1 each.
[93:04.52]$1 each.
[93:05.30]We got the Pipe Pipe.
[93:07.24]We got our very own sleeve, Mr. Slin.
[93:09.45]$102.
[93:09.81]$102.
[93:10.89]He's put down 102.
[93:12.13]He has a long heartfelt message.
[93:15.11]We can read another time.
[93:15.93]I'll leave it there.
[93:16.53]But Pipe Pipe, I imagine he's thinking maybe in his head.
[93:19.14]Thank you, Slim.
[93:20.04]Hopefully he put it down for the pipes.
[93:22.06]I got a big fist.
[93:24.36]Let's see.
[93:25.42]We got Goohy, $100.
[93:27.33]Loving the stream.
[93:28.57]Love tuning in, especially for the jump segments.
[93:30.45]Really awesome.
[93:31.11]Can you have the good work?
[93:31.93]Let's see if we can hit that pipe jumping goal.
[93:34.13]I'm with you.
[93:34.67]That's a good idea.
[93:35.77]Yeah.
[93:36.11]We just thought of that.
[93:39.38]Wow.
[93:40.74]That superchuck was a nice five.
[93:42.93]That was a good run, dude.
[93:46.02]That was really good, yeah.
[93:47.46]Oh, thank you.
[93:48.03]Alright, next.
[93:50.07]That left ramp didn't screw me over.
[93:52.81]We got Zyke and Ungato on Jump NBN.
[93:57.61]It's going to be a demo playthrough.
[93:59.93]Alright.
[94:00.45]Oh, my boy.
[94:01.92]Pat CDR, our old friend.
[94:05.24]There he is.
[94:05.64]A perennial, you know, big donator.
[94:09.92]The $500 donation.
[94:11.49]That is great.
[94:12.15]That's got to be hype arena right there.
[94:15.11]Don't wait for that.
[94:15.69]No message, but...
[94:17.49]well that's very generous the message is contributing to uh child's oncology services yep null trooper fifty dollars pipe pipe we've got 70 from international boards of pigeons that's a peculiar name bonus bucks shout out to stabby folks at the stabby stream uh hashtag pope hope
[94:36.14]Seems like they made a typo in their hashtag.
[94:38.93]They were trying to say Pipe Hype.
[94:40.97]Wrong vowel.
[94:41.65]Didn't get it there.
[94:42.65]Close, though.
[94:43.29]Almost got it.
[94:44.86]Another dollar from L.S.
[94:46.26]Bungato saying Pipe Hype.
[94:47.70]So the $1 donations are starting to come in.
[94:49.70]Guys, if everyone, like I said, can hear this, did a buck, we'd get there real quick.
[94:53.27]We're shooting up there real fast, though.
[94:55.59]$20 from J. Mizzle.
[94:57.64]Is that RJ Mizzle?
[94:59.08]Yes, it is.
[95:00.24]The message is, I love giving my money away to a good cause.
[95:03.33]Love you long time.
[95:05.31]Pipe, pipe, the type of pipe you pike the light for fight and right.
[95:09.11]Well done by Jondi.
[95:10.57]I don't think that's our Jondi.
[95:12.00]It's not?
[95:12.42]Okay.
[95:13.10]Well, it's someone named J Mizzle.
[95:15.02]Hard to imagine there's going to be more than one J Mizzle.
[95:17.64]No, that's just the name they use.
[95:19.23]Not their Jondi.
[95:20.09]100 bucks from B Lund, who's given shout outs to fellow heavy mains in the Portland Burn Siders.
[95:26.03]Yow!
[95:27.36]No pipe pipe, though, but it's fine.
[95:30.28]If I can already do something on the server, just to kind of hurry and show you guys a little plug-in that AI made that's really helpful.
[95:39.99]It's called Jump Bot.
[95:41.41]So what I can do is, since I have the admin powers, I can record a jump like this and stop the demo.
[95:51.07]Oh, I didn't record.
[95:51.87]Whoops.
[95:52.55]Hang on.
[95:53.41]Time out.
[95:54.55]Forget that.
[95:55.19]We'll rewind.
[95:56.15]Whoop!
[95:57.65]Yeah, there we go.
[95:58.39]Alright.
[95:58.85]So now I recorded.
[96:00.22]I don't know why it's not saving.
[96:01.71]Never mind.
[96:02.67]Let's not do it right now.
[96:03.58]It's broken.
[96:03.88]Good night, everybody.
[96:05.32]We're at $7,000 for the Pipe Pipe, guys.
[96:08.59]We're making the most craziest time.
[96:10.69]Another $100 coming in there.
[96:12.22]Guys, I think we might get there, but we've got to keep hitting it hard.
[96:15.80]$150, a competitive player a lot of us know.
[96:18.97]A lot of $1 donations flooding in.
[96:21.43]We had Hayden, $1 from Catface, $1 from, let's see, $1 from Nimtra, who we know.
[96:27.62]Pipe Pipe, we must double our Ed support.

[96:53.77]We are going to get it.
[96:55.22]I need a thermometer to take my temperature.
[96:57.16]I'm getting hyped to the extreme.
[97:00.12]Okay.
[97:00.20]This is really, we're reaching critical mass here with the Pipe hype.
[97:05.70]And I mean, it's got this person.
[97:07.82]Hayden said, I'm hype, and what is Pipe?
[97:09.85]If you're wondering what that is, it's our donation incentive for Pipe Launcher Jumping.
[97:14.20]And I'm sure that the demos are hearing this all, and they're like,
[97:17.25]It's even more pressure now, but we want to see this.
[97:20.03]We're over 7,000.
[97:21.48]Keep it going.
[97:22.52]Vand was $150.
[97:23.10]Vand says, hello, I'm donating a $1 for 149 other people who are too scared to donate.
[97:29.96]Well, thank you, Vand.
[97:30.92]Thank you, Vand.
[97:31.50]That's very responsible of you.
[97:33.58]Look at them all come in.
[97:56.26]DJ Sylveon, Pillar of Bees.
[97:59.63]Let's see.
[98:00.05]$32 from Atticus Koya, Pope Hope, Curl Hines.
[98:03.95]Twitch chat's going to love that.
[98:05.27]Twitch chat loves thinking they're making a funny variation on the joke.
[98:09.54]$2.
[98:10.88]Carabast, Boots, $2.
[98:12.44]Sorry, go ahead, guys.
[98:13.55]There's too many.
[98:14.19]Alright.
[98:15.29]Ready to go now?
[98:15.99]Yeah, we're ready to go.
[98:17.19]We got Zyke and Ungato going to be playing the pro course on Jump NBN.
[98:23.24]You guys can go whenever you're ready.
[98:24.70]Yep.
[98:24.76]alright uh three two one go this map is one of the harder demo maps if I'm not mistaken yeah it's like a four-year-old map or something and it's still pretty difficult yeah that's like one of the easiest tier sixes there is so tier six is the highest tier you guys have mentioned that earlier right that's as hard as it gets yeah yeah we just took what the surf community did and we just straight up copied it cool it works it's good
[98:55.15]best ideas are copied.
[98:56.44]Look at the iPhone, for example.
[98:58.60]What?
[99:00.26]Just take a bunch of cool stuff that other people made and throw them together.
[99:04.60]Like a trillion dollars.
[99:05.94]Calling you out, Steve Jobs.
[99:07.21]We'll have him maybe next year.
[99:11.01]Jeez.
[99:11.41]So, anyway, does the same mapper make all the maps with this texture here?
[99:18.08]Because whenever I log into the jump server and I see a map with this texture, it always signals...
[99:25.04]Hard demo jump map.
[99:26.40]Yeah.
[99:27.40]Yeah, this was for some reason pretty popular.
[99:30.45]It's the jump ice texture.
[99:32.35]I don't know.
[99:32.95]Nobody uses it anymore.
[99:34.11]It's been like seven years.
[99:35.04]Yeah.
[99:36.26]It's a very common texturing just because it's really easy to do and we're lazy.
[99:42.47]There you go.
[99:45.05]That's it.
[99:45.41]This is insane.
[99:48.24]Yeah, I could never do this.
[99:49.32]I don't understand how people demo jump.
[99:51.82]Going around the corner...
[99:54.03]Yeah, on the right wall, it's way harder.
[99:56.30]And it's like you said at first try.
[99:57.58]Yeah, you can also do a really dumb strat where you don't use the wall at all.
[100:00.88]I've never actually done it, but I've gotten halfway through without using the wall.
[100:05.63]There you go.
[100:07.63]And we got some more $1 donations flowing in.
[100:10.92]Once again, guys, if you keep donating, if everybody donated $1, we will be able to reach the Pipe Hype segment.
[100:17.39]We got time there.
[100:18.37]I think we can get there and I think we can find some kind of time for it.
[100:22.74]We got a whole lot more.
[100:23.88]Pipe Hype, Pope Hope.
[100:25.08]Let's see.

[101:57.75]It's too much.
[101:58.62]iPads weren't meant to handle this kind of hype.

[102:03.71]They're just popping up every second.
[102:06.23]Don't visit border.gg.

[102:10.98]Probably another one.
[102:11.61]People really don't want to go to that website.
[102:13.23]It's backed up so much that they're only just down six to five minutes.

[102:53.92]Hype for the NG Jumping.
[102:55.28]I don't know that we're doing this this year, unfortunately.
[102:58.53]But you can find videos, of course, on TF2RG.
[103:00.99]We did have a... I think we had a nice jump on the video.
[103:05.44]In the video, yeah.
[103:06.40]We saw Kip on there.
[103:07.52]Oh, yeah.
[103:08.47]This is just, just keep going here.
[103:10.91]Let's get a live count here.
[103:12.17]What are we looking at?
[103:12.73]Another 100.
[103:13.17]We were at almost.
[103:13.89]We are so close.
[103:14.35]It has to be.
[103:14.64]We were at almost just 1,000.
[103:16.12]We're just under 9,000.
[103:17.24]Oh, we're going to get there.
[103:19.38]We're going to get there, guys.
[103:20.70]Keep them donations coming, boys.
[103:22.03]Keep it going.
[103:22.57]We're running out of time here.
[103:24.53]The time is of the utmost essence.
[103:27.05]We got $10 from Saturn.
[103:28.50]We got $2 anonymous sleeping bear with a buck saying, now I'm in debt.
[103:32.06]Thank you, sleeping bear.

[103:38.25]Harambe, $5.
[103:39.56]That's funny.
[103:40.80]Enza with a dollar.
[103:42.16]Popop, CX.
[103:43.00]I don't even know anymore, man.
[103:44.19]Nero just plunking down the bucks.
[103:45.85]We got Rikachu, $30.
[103:47.83]Wish I was good at demo jumping.
[103:49.28]Just work at it.
[103:50.30]Destrolisher.
[103:52.00]Oh, boy.
[103:52.84]This is just... This is amazing.
[103:54.79]This map is insane.
[103:57.03]Yeah, between the donations and the jumping, yeah, you're making this one of the most memorable segments, guys.
[104:02.34]Keep it up.
[104:02.84]Yeah, this is easily one of the hardest jumps on this map.
[104:05.80]Looks incredible.
[104:09.01]No pressure.
[104:09.57]This feels like maybe one of the hardest maps that we've had ever on Tip of the Hats for jump.
[104:13.48]Actually, I'm not trying to, you know, hype up the ego.
[104:15.74]I think I've done something harder before.
[104:17.08]Yeah, it's up there anyway.
[104:18.96]It's way up there.
[104:20.47]Yeah, it's definitely up there.
[104:21.65]Wow.
[104:22.09]Yeah, this is still a tier six map, so.
[104:24.19]One shot that jump.
[104:27.14]How many maps are not maps?
[104:28.56]Jumps are left.
[104:29.88]Not very many.
[104:30.52]I think just one after this one.
[104:33.12]Wow.
[104:34.21]Yeah, he is.
[104:36.21]Tagorino Bambino.
[104:38.11]Currently has the world record on course two, which is the one he's playing right now.
[104:44.00]Oh, OK.
[104:45.48]Makes sense.
[104:48.08]yeah so I just got it uh yesterday when I was practicing for tough I got a 418 crushing the old world record by 20 seconds wow 20 seconds if you check out the TF2 rj weekly channel you should see it there soon yeah yeah cool normally when we're breaking world records you're looking at like a second two seconds or less
[105:11.99]Oh, my God.
[105:13.73]That was.
[105:14.43]That was insane.
[105:17.42]Holy mac and cheese.
[105:20.18]Mac and cheese.
[105:21.52]Go ahead.
[105:22.38]The thing with some of these demo maps is that the individual jumps are just so long that you can lose ten seconds by screwing up one jump.
[105:31.30]Some of the jumps on here, it's like that wall pogo jump you saw me doing earlier with all the going around corners.
[105:36.42]If you fail at the end, that's like 30, 40 seconds sometimes.
[105:39.55]Easily.
[105:40.27]$9,417.
[105:40.79]Oh, my gosh, guys.
[105:43.66]I'm actually blown away.
[105:45.38]I cannot believe the support.
[105:47.26]We started at, like, what, $5,000?
[105:49.71]Something like that?
[105:50.75]I don't know what it was exactly.
[105:51.81]20 minutes ago, we were not even close, and now it's probably going to happen.
[105:55.91]Let's see who we got.
[105:56.73]Actual pipe hype around the corner.
[105:58.38]Double hype hype.
[105:59.58]We got an artichoke, $10.
[106:01.12]We've got, let's see, ghost food with $10.
[106:04.26]Top hat, $30.
[106:05.79]Pipe me.
[106:06.33]Atta or Ata with $100.
[106:08.15]Forgot it was Tip of the Hats weekend.
[106:10.09]Hope this makes up for it.
[106:11.11]Yep, you're hyping me.
[106:12.49]Is this Tip of the Hats?
[106:13.43]QJ at KCD.
[106:16.16]It is Tip of the Hats.
[106:16.90]I said that right.
[106:18.20]Morsi, I assume of the Fanshawe variety, given a try-hard emote.
[106:21.82]Axis, 0x40.
[106:24.26]Ruthless.
[106:24.94]Adeski, I just mentioned.
[106:26.45]Adeski says, I didn't win anything at I-58, but here are $10 for Pipe Hype.
[106:31.93]Ignacio with $1, saying Pipe Hype doubles into the billions.
[106:35.45]Insubordinate Chicken, $35.
[106:37.64]Half Hero, $2.
[106:38.94]Piperoni hype.
[106:40.48]Four from MooBug.
[106:41.88]A lot of competitive players that we know and names that we recognize getting in on this.
[106:47.35]Like my lungs are suffering.
[106:48.72]I'm too excited.
[106:49.44]All the competitive players just have so much of that prize money to be throwing around.
[106:52.68]Yeah, I know, right?
[106:53.52]Running out of breath here.
[106:55.05]Do you guys have the camera in the server?
[106:58.39]EU?
[106:58.89]Yes.
[106:59.83]Yes?
[107:00.39]Okay.
[107:00.59]Here we are.
[107:01.09]It's me.
[107:01.47]No, we're not.
[107:02.51]We just switched it off.
[107:03.94]We're switching over.
[107:05.32]We'll tell you once we're in there.
[107:06.92]Nick for a dollar.

[108:19.44]We did it.
[108:20.16]I cannot believe we did it.
[108:21.51]We made it.
[108:22.29]We made the putty pipe.
[108:24.26]Woo!
[108:25.82]I've never been more excited I don't think that is unbelievable that really is unbelievable sorry boys we're we're uh and that's like a testament to it it doesn't matter how much you donate the fact that you are donating it it just contributes to such a big cause generating that amount of money in such a short period of time is unbelievable thank you guys so much I need a cigarette alright boys go for it don't smoke
[108:53.59]Alright, so what map is this, guys?
[108:55.19]I think it's Jump Cube.
[108:56.30]Jump Cube?
[108:56.92]Yeah, Jump Cube V6.
[108:58.26]This is like one of the coolest looking maps, in my opinion.
[109:01.48]I think I put a lot of time into the textures and stuff.
[109:06.89]Oh, we were playing this the other day.
[109:08.25]This was on a server recently and we were commenting.
[109:10.83]I like the little instructional panels with the little icons that tell you what the jumps are.
[109:15.74]I was very impressed by this one.
[109:17.82]Yeah, he put a lot of time.
[109:19.43]This just went on Tempus, I think, or it might have been ECJ.
[109:21.99]I don't remember.
[109:23.87]Well, I don't think this is that new of a map, but it is a very nice map.
[109:28.01]It's similar to Jump Force Starters, in my opinion, at least aesthetically.
[109:33.70]It's a very nice map.
[109:35.00]The only stage that's a bit convoluted, in my opinion, is the last one.
[109:38.71]We will see that one.
[109:40.49]There's a lot of targets you've got to shoot.
[109:42.65]I love the little hologram that shows you what kind of jump it's going to be in the beginning.
[109:45.93]Yeah, I was just saying that little thing.
[109:47.20]Cool detail, yeah.
[109:48.59]It's cool.
[109:49.53]I thought it was new.
[109:50.19]I was wrong.
[109:50.63]Whatever.
[109:51.11]It was new to me.
[109:52.07]There you go.
[109:52.92]It's new to a lot of people, I'm sure.
[109:54.90]It looks modern, that's why.
[109:56.14]It doesn't look like those old maps, you know?
[109:58.87]Yeah.
[110:00.93]Yes.
[110:01.35]Not that the old maps look bad.
[110:02.73]Portal 7.
[110:03.57]Yeah.
[110:03.93]It's no jump propel fixed by Kofsta, I'll tell you that.
[110:07.78]There you go.
[110:09.31]Wow, so it's already on the red course?
[110:10.73]There's no way.
[110:11.87]I think Ben's cheating.
[110:14.52]Can we get him out of here?
[110:16.38]The plugin isn't perfectly set up.
[110:20.72]It's okay.
[110:22.06]And I think Minto, who we're watching now, also cheated.
[110:24.91]The exploit section.
[110:25.93]Oh, really?
[110:26.77]Just a bunch of cheaters.
[110:28.01]So Gibbous is the actual leader right now.
[110:30.49]Wow, so guys, start the chargebacks.
[110:32.99]What?
[110:33.74]No, don't.
[110:36.30]In the lead.
[110:37.00]Just kidding.
[110:38.86]I can't believe we hit the incentive.
[110:40.28]That's amazing.
[110:41.50]Amazing.

[111:25.52]Hi.
[111:26.52]Skia with $10.
[111:28.14]$20 from Kirch.
[111:29.12]$10 from Random.
[111:32.51]Just a lot.
[111:34.77]A lot of them.
[111:35.73]$2 from Boots.
[111:36.57]Pep Hep.
[111:37.37]$1 from Banku.
[111:38.07]Speaking of Lang, Mike, what do we got Lang doing if we hit the next donation incentive?
[111:43.66]I believe it's Guitar Hero TF2?
[111:47.00]Yeah, also known as Pyro Hero.
[111:49.49]Let's have a look.
[111:50.27]So let me refresh the page here.
[111:52.79]I'll just use the refresh button.
[111:54.39]$6,589 out of $10,000 for Lang playing TF2 with a Guitar Hero controller.
[112:02.16]And I'm just going to give a little tip and a highlight out there to the viewers.
[112:06.72]I'm told the strumming thing is how you shoot.
[112:10.13]That is so cool.
[112:11.13]Which is hilarious.
[112:11.79]She's actually going off.
[112:13.59]Funnier to me for some reason.
[112:15.51]Something about that.
[112:16.55]If you just held down a button, it wouldn't be the same.
[112:18.81]But doing the strumming thing to shoot, I'm into that.
[112:21.54]Yeah.
[112:22.52]I Fs with it.
[112:23.26]Yeah, definitely.
[112:24.38]So that's at $65.89 out of $10,000 right now.
[112:28.86]$66.99, just even as I refresh the page.
[112:32.37]So that's our next hype.
[112:34.51]Guitar Hero hype.
[112:35.91]I don't think that... Well, alright.
[112:37.31]I think I have a little more hype in the chamber.
[112:39.73]I just need to eat lunch first.
[112:41.31]Yeah, we're trying our best.
[112:42.30]Cheesecake hype.
[112:43.66]Cheesecake hype.
[112:44.50]We had Poop Hoop, and that's $150 donation.
[112:47.20]That's why I read it.
[112:48.54]Poop.
[112:50.56]Poopy.
[112:53.83]Just say wacky words and Wyatt will just laugh his bum off.
[112:57.61]His butt.
[112:57.85]You're right.
[112:58.31]Tang from Rayburn, my man.
[112:59.35]My butt's falling off right now.
[113:00.94]Say one more wacky word and it's coming right off.
[113:03.40]Julander with an $11 donation as well.
[113:07.17]Thank you, Julander.
[113:08.43]It was fun pubbing with you the other day.
[113:09.87]How can pipes exist if our hypes aren't real?
[113:12.35]They are real.
[113:13.07]We just found out.
[113:14.40]Pop Hops.
[113:15.72]Shout out to Curtis Russ.
[113:17.26]That's from Ian Thompson.
[113:18.42]Tacky on.
[113:19.38]Well, thank you.
[113:22.43]I recognize the name, but I don't know who the alias is.
[113:25.39]Is there an alias attached to it?
[113:28.76]Tachyon.
[113:29.92]Tachyon.
[113:30.54]He called me a nerd on Twitter the other day.
[113:32.76]Don't think I didn't see it.
[113:33.88]Oh, yeah?
[113:36.66]Yep.
[113:38.09]Well, he likes me at least.
[113:40.41]One out of three ain't bad.
[113:41.71]What do you think of Wyatt?
[113:43.61]Donate again, Tachyon.
[113:45.35]Tell us if you like mail or not.
[113:47.10]Here's another hundred.
[113:50.58]Boy, oh boy.
[113:51.74]I've got a billion of these to clear through.
[113:54.08]$5 from Skurr says, I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pipe hype.
[113:57.99]I work here with my old pipe and my hype, big pipe.
[114:00.79]Everything here has a hype and a pipe.
[114:02.81]One thing I've learned after 21 years, you never know what is going to pipe through that hype.
[114:08.40]Everyone looking at me for my reaction to that.
[114:11.46]Well, we're working our way through this map.
[114:13.10]Bashi is going ham right now.
[114:15.35]He's a couple stages ahead.
[114:16.97]Not many left over as well, so...
[114:19.63]This race is looking to co
[114:24.68]yep bosh is in first and he didn't cheat his way to get to the last course oh that's good how about that that's always nice by the way this is worth mentioning milkshakes donated 100 bucks and said if we get the pipe dream to become a reality which we already have I'll throw in my number 44 craft tipped lid 44 the kids 44 of the kids so we'll be looking for that one that's pretty cool yeah crisscross 30 bucks
[114:50.58]So when is the- is the Pipe Pipe, like, right after this?
[114:52.75]When is it happening?
[114:53.59]Yeah, we're going straight to the Pipe Pipe.
[114:54.63]You guys gotta prime that and get it ready to go if you can.
[114:56.73]They weren't just words.
[114:57.81]We weren't just talking nonsense.
[115:00.01]Is it a real thing?
[115:00.87]I know it sounds funny.
[115:01.61]There's so much pressure on the actual event.
[115:05.20]Yep.
[115:06.68]WarHerYeah.gg, $5.
[115:08.66]I just completed Jump Beef with a world record time of 25 minutes, 30 seconds.
[115:13.03]Well done, War.
[115:13.81]And why don't you, like me, get a whale?
[115:17.85]You stink.
[115:18.80]That's a good one.
[115:23.05]Smells like cats up and mice reviews.
[115:29.13]I don't like Wario.
[115:30.10]You're alright.
[115:30.74]Twitch chat is always right and this is no exception.
[115:35.08]Shoutouts from Lye to Fishy, Fractal, and AI.
[115:42.39]Boy, another 100 coming through from Anonymous.
[115:44.60]Yeah, Anonymous is the biggest donor.
[115:46.80]I can't.
[115:47.20]I got to mark it and get all these marked.
[115:49.19]I can't keep up with it.
[115:50.95]It's just like... Jason's just in the other room just shuffling them all in.
[115:56.17]Trolling me.
[115:57.39]He has a huge grin on his face, I'm sure.
[115:59.40]Trollorino.
[116:00.70]And we're already getting really close to the Guitar Hero Pyro as well.
[116:04.35]Yeah, 6831, so that'll be coming soon, hopefully.
[116:07.89]We need, like, a saying for that.
[116:09.19]We'll have to come up with it during the next segment.
[116:11.18]Hopefully the Scout can do that.
[116:15.53]Mm-hmm.
[116:15.85]TrollfaceXD.
[116:18.23]High five.
[116:19.96]Feels good, man.
[116:21.48]Hyping those pipes.
[116:22.72]We got another one from Ian Thompson.
[116:25.63]We'll find out what he has to say.
[116:27.57]Who's number two?
[116:28.93]Why don't you judge the entire staff as humans?
[116:31.60]Keep donating and tell us about ourselves.
[116:35.05]We love you.
[116:35.51]Don't get the wrong idea.
[116:36.93]He's on Twitter a lot.
[116:38.13]He retweets a lot of stuff, and he plays, I believe.
[116:40.33]I think he's in IM, possibly.
[116:41.85]So shoutouts to him.
[116:42.59]Well, thank you.
[116:43.82]Here's the shotguns.
[116:44.78]Megamome donates $1.
[116:45.82]It says, boy, it's much easier in this version.
[116:48.12]There's no... And that's the end of the map.
[116:49.94]Wow.
[116:51.22]You ever been tired?
[116:52.10]That's what Megamome said.
[116:53.86]Nice one.
[116:54.36]So hopefully we can get... Yeah, let's get the pipe pipe, boys.
[116:57.85]Yeah, the server's already ready.
[116:59.21]Okay.
[117:00.09]So Aaron is getting in the server.
[117:03.77]We're getting it.
[117:04.71]Go get it.
[117:06.97]Anonymous again.
[117:08.11]Thank you.
[117:09.39]I can't read English anymore.
[117:12.09]My brain broke.
[117:15.58]Kyger, two bucks for me and my wife.
[117:18.22]A dollar from each of us.
[117:19.04]Truck Truck is a handsome boy.
[117:20.54]Aw.
[117:20.72]Thank you.
[117:21.25]You are a handsome boy.
[117:23.01]I'm a man child.
[117:23.69]Ten dollars from Ghost Food.
[117:24.85]This is all I have left to donate.
[117:26.69]I love this stream.
[117:27.51]I love everyone involved.
[117:28.41]Shout out to Coffee's grandson, everyone's favorite, Pfeiffer.
[117:31.12]I don't know what that means.
[117:33.42]What the heck?
[117:33.68]That's a cool example of someone.
[117:43.33]Ali used to be a huge jumper and was one of the most well-known ones.
[117:46.34]We had him on Tip of the Hats, and now he's kind of made that transition to playing competitive, one of the best in the world, which is pretty cool.
[117:54.27]He was actually supposed to be on the stream and do a map, but he told me that he broke his arm, so I don't know.
[117:58.95]Wow, that's unfortunate.
[118:00.51]But Ellie has actually posted on the stream highlights channel for one of the funniest jump highlights on a live stream.
[118:07.26]We'll have to check that out.
[118:08.02]I think it's called He Doesn't Believe It.
[118:09.28]I'm pretty sure you'll find it if you Google it.
[118:12.81]Aurora and Ali, yeah.
[118:13.85]Alright.
[118:14.77]So it's the moment we've all been waiting for as Super Chuck puts down $100.01.
[118:20.37]So tell us how this is going to work with the Pipe Pipe.
[118:23.38]So, it's a race.
[118:25.54]You can say it.
[118:26.20]You can do it.
[118:28.39]This map has a special little attribute to it where the pipes actually don't roll around all that much so it's really easy to get exactly where you need to.
[118:38.25]Okay.
[118:38.87]And I think this is an entirely bounce course, correct?
[118:43.41]I haven't actually played this map.
[118:44.97]I have no idea.
[118:45.73]I just know Gorge004 is like the man at this map.
[118:51.20]He has like the world record on it.
[118:52.78]Yeah, he has like a sub one minute time on this bonus.
[118:55.68]Well, it's a bonus on the real map, but... Yeah, so he's probably the one to spec.
[119:00.67]Oh, we got him.
[119:01.89]The end of the map where the capture point is has a little surprise.
[119:06.09]Ooh, I can't wait.
[119:07.25]I love surprises.
[119:08.21]You want to count this down?
[119:09.81]Yeah, I'll count it down.
[119:11.22]Three, two...
[119:13.55]One, go.
[119:16.67]Guys, I've got pipe hype.
[119:18.31]Do you have it, Twitch chat?
[119:20.23]Tell us if you've got pipe hype.
[119:21.74]I think at least a few of you will.
[119:24.48]So it is, you know, and we see here actually a couple, at least a couple of the jumpers opting for the Iron Bomber, which sort of slows down the roll even more, even though the map does it as well.
[119:35.99]I would say that they are cheating and they should be disqualified.
[119:38.43]Yeah, can we get them out of here, please?
[119:40.29]Get them out of here.
[119:41.84]Oh, so what is this?
[119:43.55]George is what?
[119:45.37]Gorge.
[119:46.03]You need two pipes to get up here.
[119:49.74]So you have to kind of just spam the second one up there.
[119:53.36]And hope that it all works out.
[119:54.94]This is crazy to me.
[119:56.40]Yeah, this is something else.
[120:00.06]I'm looking away from the iPad because this is wild.
[120:05.73]Barrymore is taking a huge lead.
[120:08.05]Yeah, this map is pretty crazy.
[120:11.67]Wow, what is he doing here?
[120:13.55]Are you serious?
[120:14.53]What?
[120:16.10]But you can't control when they explode, so you have to pre-fire every single pipe.
[120:20.18]Right.
[120:22.78]Oh, my gosh.
[120:28.23]One thing that I've sort of noticed in the jump community is that a lot of the map makers have been becoming increasingly bored with just standard jump maps.
[120:36.94]So we just come up with stupid stuff like this and just give it to people.
[120:41.80]We got Jermis sneaking in because we got to say goodbye to him in a couple minutes.
[120:45.21]We're watching still the Pipe Pipe race here on the screen.
[120:48.44]It went a little long, so we're trying to get everything fit in here.
[120:52.65]This guy's got to catch an airplane.
[120:56.08]how long have you been a pilot for Jerma a couple years that's cool great job but this I I was looking forward to seeing this yeah everyone was like yeah apparently I didn't think it was even physically possible to do this oh my gosh you're so close yeah using multiple pipes is like doing one pipe jump is enough for me that feels like a victory for me you know
[121:24.72]Oh, my God.
[121:25.50]He's going to get it.
[121:26.88]He's going to do it.
[121:29.60]Oh, my God.
[121:30.98]This is so wild.
[121:32.08]So you have to, like, bounce off this pipe here.
[121:35.38]Are you kidding?
[121:35.88]Yeah, this is the first bounce.
[121:38.21]The first bounce?
[121:40.61]You can't touch the ground.
[121:42.93]There's more than one here.
[121:44.31]Wild.
[121:44.67]I hope not, but maybe.
[121:48.64]Wild.
[121:50.50]Should I explain how bounces work?
[121:52.64]Yeah, sure.
[121:53.74]Why not?
[121:54.89]Alright, so bounces are, um, they're probably my favorite exploit in the entire game.
[122:00.74]Uh, basically there's this little two-unit window, which for anyone that doesn't know Hammer, uh, that's a little inch and a half, basically, where if you're above the ground and you happen to land in that spot, the game will just stop you.
[122:14.50]So what we've done is, um, we've found, like, all of the heights, all of the list of heights where this will always happen, and we just threw that onto a big spreadsheet.
[122:24.74]and now when a rocket hits like when you hit the ground the explosion happens at the exact same time so you would get boosted as if you were just standing on the ground normally no way this can't be real he just did both bounces there and now he has to air shot himself in the end yeah what even with all the pressure he's just pulling through I can't handle this
[122:53.87]No way.
[122:55.31]It looked like it connected.
[122:56.27]Oh my gosh.
[123:00.94]He's so good.
[123:05.93]He's looking up and crouch jumping so he gets the proper angle off the pipe.
[123:14.37]Yeah, and you also need, this is, aim is really important when you're just doing demo jumping in general, but it's especially important here, just because you have to arc it to match whatever your arc is going to be.
[123:24.96]Right.
[123:26.56]Oh my gosh.
[123:28.87]This is the last stage of the jump segment here.
[123:31.77]But we do have a surprise at the end as well.
[123:33.59]We do.
[123:34.73]I have no idea what the surprise even is.
[123:38.58]I think there's like three people in the world that know.
[123:41.89]I'm not one of them.
[123:43.03]This is exciting.
[123:44.44]Oh, he hit him, too.
[123:46.20]Super Chuck's right behind him, dude.
[123:47.68]This could be close.
[123:49.28]Oh, boy.
[123:57.47]Does the silence... Oh!
[123:59.01]He's got it.
[124:02.06]The straights.
