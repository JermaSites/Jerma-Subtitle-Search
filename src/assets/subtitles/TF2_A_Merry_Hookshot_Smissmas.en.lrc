[00:07.09]Foundry with... There's a briefcase here?
[00:16.13]What the fuck is going on there?
[00:20.53]They added hookshot to the game?
[00:23.89]They added hookshots?
[00:25.43]This is a fucking Legend of Zelda now?
[00:28.91]How do I get one?
[00:30.73]Where do I get one, where do I get one?
[00:32.35]How do I, is it Q?
[00:33.37]It's gotta be Q. It's not Q. So, this item, alright, let's do, let's talk hookshot.
[00:43.83]So this, this is just capture the flag.
[00:45.59]Ooh, watch out for this guy.
[00:53.19]So this, this sticky, new sticky launcher is all about the quick detonations, huh?
[00:58.40]It max charges faster.
[01:01.18]This is like a combination of a lot of different items.
[01:05.24]Because I can do stuff like this.
[01:08.32]What I meant to say was just bottle this guy.
[01:12.00]That's what I meant to say.
[01:13.66]You know what, we're gonna hookshot.
[01:15.68]He didn't even know what had happened.
[01:16.80]This guy didn't even know.
[01:19.46]That guy knew behind me, but the scout in front of me doesn't.
[01:23.10]What is this?
[01:23.94]Give me this!
[01:25.18]Ooh, I got precision power-up.
[01:27.36]What does that mean?
[01:29.02]Precision power-up?
[01:31.84]Do I have... Holy shit.
[01:33.64]Do you see how far that goes?
[01:34.56]Oh my god, dude.
[01:38.64]I can like snipe... Oh, you ruined it!
[01:45.06]Why am I walking around?
[01:46.94]When that's in the game.
[01:49.58]Why am I not going all over the place with that?
[01:52.20]How far does it go?
[01:53.04]Can I go all the way up there?
[01:55.26]You've got to be shitting me right now.
[01:57.98]And these places are no longer... I...
[02:05.66]This guy!
[02:06.62]Come here!
[02:09.06]He's gonna blow up from that one.
[02:11.74]Give me the Batman!
[02:13.30]I got the vampire power-up?
[02:15.18]So I'm assuming I heal off of hits or something, right?
[02:19.14]That's interesting.
[02:20.66]I'm gonna go be Batman.
[02:22.92]Be a bird of prey.
[02:23.90]I'm gonna just snipe people with this thing.
[02:29.02]Oh my god, are you serious?
[02:31.82]I get to stay up here?
[02:34.89]This guy's not even gonna know where I'm hitting him from.
[02:37.59]Lookit, he's just like, oh, he's hookshotting.
[02:39.05]He's like, what the fuck's happening?
[02:40.25]Where am I?
[02:40.83]You think you can hookshot away from me?
[02:43.03]I'll hookshot to you.
[02:46.28]Hookshot heavy is crazy, man.
[02:50.24]What?
[02:50.92]Hookshot spy is even crazier.
[02:56.66]Invisible hookshot.
[02:57.84]This guy's toast.
[03:02.78]That is ridiculous.
[03:04.28]You can't see me!
[03:07.40]Where did I go?
[03:08.14]I was invisible the whole time, you see.
[03:15.33]Again.
[03:15.57]Let's see if I can stay.
[03:20.03]No, actually, I guess I have to stay.
[03:21.53]That is so messed up!
[03:28.07]You can just do that all over the place.
[03:30.46]And you can be invisible!
[03:32.83]It's like, really?!
[03:33.59]I have four crits right now.
[03:40.72]I gotta make use of this.
[03:44.06]Get back there, I see the mini sentry, I see ya.
[03:46.36]I don't even need, you don't even need to disguise!
[03:49.32]Why would I disguise?
[03:50.14]Well I can just like hookshot around, like what's the point of disguising?
[04:00.30]Let's see if I can... I do have crit sources.
[04:01.84]Oh, the Warlock.
[04:02.40]Give me the Warlock.
[04:06.66]I'll wait for him.
[04:07.18]Let's see.
[04:09.67]Ready?
[04:09.93]Ready?
[04:10.13]Ready?
[04:10.31]Ready?
[04:10.47]Let's see if I can get him when he comes up.
[04:13.73]Ooh, it worked!
[04:15.23]It worked!
[04:16.45]Sort of.
[04:18.89]Sort of.
[04:20.46]No, I don't want to give away... Come here!
[04:22.62]Come here!
[04:23.64]Come here!
[04:24.82]Come here!
[04:27.72]If I just had only swung a second earlier...
[04:31.92]Get me out of here!
[04:34.40]Oh my god, I'm freaking out right now.
[04:36.66]Alright, put a disguise on.
[04:38.24]For the first time in the entire time you've been playing Spy.
[04:40.80]Put an enemy disguise on.
[04:43.38]Okay, good.
[04:44.04]Look, I'm just a demo man.
[04:45.24]Hi.
[04:45.50]I'm a demo man using my rocket hookshot thing.
[04:51.32]Cool, huh?
[04:52.10]Oh, what?
[04:53.06]How did he know?
[04:56.01]This must be super speed.
[04:59.59]Hookshot this way.
[05:03.68]Oh, come on.
[05:05.44]Oh, what?
[05:05.74]I should have hookshot it up there.
[05:07.22]I'm stupid.
[05:07.88]Is this their spawn?
[05:12.04]But they're protected though, right?
[05:15.17]We can't like immediately insta-kill them.
[05:16.85]No, we can't.
[05:19.97]Whoa.
[05:25.43]I'm going to try to hookshot kill this guy.
[05:27.78]I'm going to go for a hookshot kill on this guy.
[05:29.66]Where is he?
[05:31.50]Damn it.
[05:35.76]What the fuck is going on?
[05:36.96]Let's make this happen.
[05:47.54]One, two, three, four.
[05:52.48]No, don't let him get away!
[05:59.95]So this quick fix medic... I wonder if he's going to follow me all the way up here.
[06:04.65]Let's go.
[06:11.56]I seem to be levitating this medic.
[06:15.67]Come with me, let's go!
[06:16.53]We got places to go, let's go this way now.
[06:20.16]Come with me, let's fly!
[06:20.88]No!
