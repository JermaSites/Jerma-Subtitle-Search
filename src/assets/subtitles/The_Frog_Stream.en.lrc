[01:18.32]Why am I a fucking ten-year-old?
[01:20.02]I don't know.
[01:21.85]I'll never know.
[01:22.37]We're gonna mystery stream tonight, because I don't feel good.
[01:28.82]My throat's fine, my body's fine, I just have a wicked bad headache.
[01:32.26]And I know I'm starting to get sick, so... We're doing a mystery stream.
[01:41.33]Give me a minute or two.
[02:24.06]Alright, so tonight what we're gonna do I'm gonna have a little bit of a fun stream here because I don't know how long it's gonna be But long enough, I think I'm gonna wait for the people.
[02:35.93]I'm gonna wait for a little bit so people can trickle in I'm gonna turn this music off too.
[02:39.11]The music is just kind of loopy Let's drop the music a little
[02:48.53]Okay, so because Sorcery was supposed to be tonight, but is that a learning game?
[02:55.43]I have no idea, actually.
[02:57.44]I have no fucking clue.
[02:58.52]I don't have a single clue.
[03:02.17]Sorcery 4 was going to be tonight, but I'm not up for it.
[03:05.55]I like to obviously get into sorcery and do all the voices, and it's a lot of dialog to read.
[03:10.46]And my head kind of hurts.
[03:13.08]I'm not really feeling well, so this is kind of going to be just a... You know, it's Friday, 7 o'clock.
[03:19.04]Well, it's 7.30 now, but I want to go for a couple hours and I'll do some fun, just dumb shit.
[03:24.50]And hopefully you guys have a good weekend.
[03:26.56]And on Tuesday, hopefully I come back with a...
[03:31.38]Revitalized spirit, as they say.
[03:35.69]Anyways.
[03:37.43]We got a mystery stream.
[03:39.17]A triple matinee.
[03:40.55]I don't even know if this is going to work.
[03:45.47]I spent the last 25 minutes seeing what this would do.
[03:48.86]So I can't guarantee.
[03:51.12]I might hard crash.
[03:51.96]My computer crashed hard when I just tried to do this last time.
[03:55.92]So it's a miracle that this stream even turned on.
[04:01.05]It's a miracle.
[04:04.37]So because of this joke, I don't know how long it's gonna last.
[04:10.39]We're gonna wait for people to come in.
[04:13.70]Yeah, it's a matinee.
[04:14.82]It's a triple matinee.
[04:19.64]I mean, it's gonna be so funny.
[04:20.58]I'm gonna switch scenes here.
[04:23.62]And the whole stream's gonna crash.
[04:27.69]But at least it'll be worth it.
[04:30.39]At least it might be worth it.
[04:31.67]Yeah, I probably will blue screen.
[04:39.46]So, uh, without further ado.
[04:41.02]It's been about five minutes.
[04:44.76]Are you guys ready for what the mystery stream is?
[04:53.50]I hope the computer doesn't crash.
[04:57.19]Ladies and gentlemen.
[05:00.33]By the way, thank you Toast69 for your subscription.
[05:06.36]You do have a first name, too, but I'm not going to read it.
[05:08.66]It's Three Frog Games!
[05:11.56]We've got Handsome Mr. Frog, we've got Frog Climbers, and we've got the Witch's Frog!
[05:18.16]You didn't think this was going to be a Three Frog Game stream tonight?
[05:23.25]Are you shitting me?
[05:26.05]At the same fucking time?
[05:27.51]Alright, frog climbers it is.
[05:33.61]Frodo, it's witches pranks, frogs fortune.
[05:40.45]They're all in windows, so it's like kinda hard.
[05:43.54]Alright, let's go.
[05:45.88]Let's play this one first.
[05:49.08]Wave one, I don't even know what that means.
[05:50.20]Handsome Mr. Frog.
[05:59.98]I died.
[06:00.42]What about this one?
[06:02.48]Frog Climbers.
[06:05.70]I don't think I can... Let's play Frog Climbers.
[06:10.17]Hold on.
[06:11.11]I'm okay.
[06:12.37]I gotta kill one more enemy.
[06:13.35]No, I'm dead.
[06:15.13]Per se.
[06:18.15]Where am I going?
[06:19.05]Classic mode.
[06:22.55]I just keep dying.
[06:23.49]How many lives do I have over here?
[06:26.87]I can't jump anymore.
[06:27.91]I lost the ability to jump on this one.
[06:32.50]Do I have to land on their heads?
[06:35.98]I have no idea.
[06:38.76]Can I at least get one kill?
[06:41.86]No, we can't.
[06:43.92]Let's do it.
[06:45.12]Play.
[06:47.08]Frog climbers.
[06:47.76]This is when you gotta, like, really, you gotta use the controller and you gotta climb up.
[06:50.93]You gotta grab the different, the different edges.
[06:54.43]What button is it asking me to press?
[06:56.09]Oh god, that's what it is.
[06:57.01]Alright, then I pull up?
[06:59.51]Yep.
[07:01.81]Alright, seems fun.
[07:03.09]What about this one?
[07:05.51]Witch's Pranks.
[07:07.31]I already beat this one.
[07:09.19]I'm getting the credits.
[07:11.43]Okay, let's go back to Frog Climbers.
[07:18.06]Almost to the top of the first level.
[07:24.22]This is fucking stupid, I made it!
[07:26.22]Okay, we gotta beat the first level on this one.
[07:27.78]Shit, I fell down.
[07:31.88]Okay, I didn't beat it, apparently.
[07:34.63]I don't understand what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing.
[07:38.67]What is the- what are you doing, this one?
[07:40.93]Oh, you can stick my tongue out.
[07:43.05]You eat the bad guys and you spit them out.
[07:44.43]This is like- actually, this game's like kind of fun.
[07:49.31]It's like Bubble Bobble.
[07:57.32]That's right, this one, remember, this one's handsome, Mr. Frog.
[07:59.86]Is that it?
[08:03.10]Do I win?
[08:06.17]How do I kill this guy?
[08:07.27]Do I have to stomp on him?
[08:12.45]No, I'm dead.
[08:12.83]Alright, let's go back, back, back, back.
[08:15.23]Get me out of this.
[08:16.91]Uh, play.
[08:17.43]Okay, it's hard crashing my whole computer.
[08:25.31]Alright, this one has a cutscene.
[08:26.35]We're gonna move... No, shit, it has to be like at the... Skip the cutscene.
[08:30.47]Do I need a tutorial?
[08:31.33]No.
[08:34.72]Ah, shit, this is like a fucking click and point, choose your own... Where are the frogs in this one?
[08:41.46]This one has frog in the title.
[08:47.82]I'm about to X out of this window.
[08:51.82]Okay, hold on.
[08:52.68]Give me one more second.
[08:55.15]Give me a second, hold on.
[08:57.16]I just gotta, uh... Gotta get one more thing loaded up here.
[09:01.96]Real quick.
[09:04.04]Real quick, I've got another one.
[09:06.78]It's gonna be loud.
[09:08.18]It's gonna be loud.
[09:10.82]We got the one to fucking save the... We got the game to save all the games.
[09:15.94]Are you guys ready for the final game?
[09:19.75]Where is it?
[09:24.26]Shit, I don't think it even recognizes this is a game on the screen.
[09:30.17]Come on.
[09:31.51]Recognize that there's a game.
[09:32.77]Pull, pull it!
[09:33.87]Game capture, come on.
[09:39.03]Oh shit, I can't even, it won't even capture the game.
[09:42.04]The joke is ruined!
[09:47.06]Hold on.
[09:48.46]Can I bring this on my other monitor?
[09:58.06]No, come on.
[10:00.90]Come on, please pull it now.
[10:05.00]No, it's not gonna work.
[10:06.60]This is a waste of fucking like 20 bucks.
[10:10.23]Just pretend what it is.
[10:15.09]You guys can pretend to know what this is.
[10:19.03]Wait, settings.
[10:19.49]Come on, come on.
[10:20.13]Let me get it back to the main menu.
[10:24.59]Hold on.
[10:26.36]Shit.
[10:27.90]That's not working.
[10:31.20]This is the most important one of all of them.
[10:38.10]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[10:39.58]I'm gonna have to do, like... It was Princess and the Frog.
[10:43.11]It was the Disney movie game.
[10:44.33]But it won't... I can't even, like, get it on the screen.
[10:49.15]It was 20 fucking dollars.
[10:56.55]You at least gotta get some audio.
[11:00.24]Just so you can, like, pretend to know what's going on.
[11:04.66]Let's get, like, one guy to say a word so you know that I'm not lying.
[11:08.66]When I say- I can't even control the game.
[11:11.14]Here we go.
[11:11.62]Alright, uh, just so you can know.
[11:12.91]Tiana, I may have to eat here every night of the week.
[11:16.91]Okay, go fuck yourself.
[11:17.87]That's it.
[11:18.55]That's it.
[11:19.55]That was a $20- $20 for him to say that one line because I can't put it on the screen.
[11:23.87]Let's get back into Handsome Frog.
[11:30.15]He's already dead.
[11:32.49]Give me my bits back!
[11:37.88]Oh, I made it!
[11:38.48]Look, Jerma!
[11:40.84]I'm almost at the top handsomest frog.
[11:44.78]I gotta go beat that guy.
[11:45.68]I have to be the most handsome frog in the world.
[11:48.64]Give me a second.
[11:53.53]I actually kind of want to, like, play this game.
[11:57.27]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[12:01.33]Well, let's go.
[12:02.77]Wait, I have to go back to the other one.
[12:05.63]No, no, no, wait.
[12:06.05]Let me just be the most handsome frog in the world, and then we can go from there.
[12:13.18]Wave two.
[12:13.56]You just got to make sure you end on an even number.
[12:15.44]Here we go.
[12:22.06]Wave three.
[12:23.42]Come on.
[12:24.74]I want to be the world's most handsome frog.
[12:26.88]It's very important.
[12:31.48]How many points do I need?
[12:32.54]I think I already did it.
[12:33.84]Yeah, I already won.
[12:34.76]I'm the best in the world at this game.
[12:37.68]I win.
[12:39.86]We gotta get rid of the alligators and the buzzard peas.
[12:45.44]I wanna make sure none of you guys buy this game and beat my score, so I'm gonna double it.
[12:52.19]Down here.
[12:54.65]Shit.
[12:55.01]Okay, I don't even care if I lose.
[12:56.05]Alright, I'm the best frog in the world, so it doesn't matter.
[12:59.81]Let's go back to the other one.
[13:08.80]Hold on, which one is this?
[13:12.97]Look at this frog's fucking face.
[13:18.55]That's the greatest frog I've ever seen.
[13:20.58]That's the best frog ever.
[13:23.98]I wish I was that frog.
[13:32.24]That's the most handsome frog.
[13:34.84]Get out of here.
[13:36.06]This game just sucks.
[13:37.38]Put this one behind all the other ones.
[13:43.61]Move this one down.
[13:44.47]Oh, fuck.
[13:49.05]I think I've ruined it all.
[13:53.90]Shit.
[13:54.30]Alright, well, we're going to put it back where it belongs.
[13:56.10]I was going to...
[13:58.02]I was gonna bring Princess and the Frog out, put it in the other corner, and have four frog games, but... OBS can't pull Princess and the Frog.
[14:10.72]I can't even, like, see who's doing this right now.
[14:14.34]This one's gonna go up.
[14:18.25]Right there, right there.
[14:19.43]Alright, let's go back to it.
[14:22.27]Where is that?
[14:22.67]I don't even know where that one is.
[14:26.00]There it is.
[14:26.32]Okay.
[14:27.37]Tutorial, don't worry.
[14:28.23]Let's go.
[14:28.49]3, 2, 1, jump back up.
[14:29.59]Okay, this one has like no sound.
[14:36.87]I have to get to the top and I have to wait.
[14:39.29]Last time I just fell right off.
[14:44.54]Here we go.
[14:45.92]I got it now.
[14:46.52]I got it now.
[14:50.92]Day.
[14:51.20]By the way, best game of the whole entire frog stream.
[14:56.81]Handsome frog.
[14:58.21]It's like 80 cents.
[15:05.17]Get me up there.
[15:05.67]I want to beat at least the first level.
[15:08.24]If I beat the first level, I'll be happy.
[15:12.56]Come on, you tree frog.
[15:13.96]Get it.
[15:15.50]Get it.
[15:17.16]Yes, I got it.
[15:19.28]Yes.
[15:20.32]No, I just let go of both hands.
[15:23.84]I'm so awful at stuff like this.
[15:29.20]climb ah almost there okay I'm gonna be able to swing and get this one no I can't pull up with this hand and grab with this one handsome frog did I win I won
[15:56.18]You're gonna capture the Disney frog?
[15:58.66]I'm so confused right now.
[16:01.08]I will capture Disney frog, I promise.
[16:03.42]But it's gonna require me to get out of all the rest of these games.
[16:11.97]I could fire spit now.
[16:15.01]So many lives.
[16:22.00]No, just kill me.
[16:22.68]Kill me.
[16:24.92]Kill me.
[16:26.10]Kill me six more times in a row.
[16:29.69]While I do this.
[16:32.99]I'm so sad that the other one is a legit just choose-your-own-adventure point-and-click game.
[16:39.15]I have to beat this level.
[16:40.45]This is a shitty tutorial.
[16:48.23]I will capture Princess and the Frog.
[16:50.01]We'll end on that one.
[16:51.11]We'll get rid of this joke in a minute.
[16:52.60]Not even a joke.
[16:56.94]I just deleted $35.
[16:58.48]That's all that happened.
[17:01.46]Grab it.
[17:04.26]Grab it.
[17:06.49]Come on, grab it.
[17:08.03]Grab it.
[17:09.61]Grab it.
[17:10.01]Come on.
[17:11.45]Grab it.
[17:14.11]Yeah.
[17:16.81]Handsomest frog.
[17:19.07]Oh fuck, I'm not even close to being handsome as Frog.
[17:23.77]Now what?
[17:24.36]Do I have to keep climbing this?
[17:30.26]Just let me beat this level!
[17:31.78]And then we can take a look at what the other game actually is.
[17:34.90]Come on!
[17:35.64]Come on!
[17:36.32]Grib it!
[17:37.56]Grib it!
[17:38.98]Yes, I gribbed it.
[17:42.56]It's a long tutorial.
[17:51.94]I'm like doing a prey position.
[17:57.22]29 meters left.
[17:58.34]Come on.
[17:58.58]I beat the first level of Handsome Frog.
[18:00.13]I have to beat Frog Climbers, too.
[18:02.45]Super important.
[18:03.19]Do you see that grab, by the way?
[18:04.89]It's pretty awesome.
[18:10.91]I just panicked.
[18:13.55]There we go.
[18:14.03]There we go.
[18:17.70]Figured it out.
[18:19.14]It's not as hard as I thought it was.
[18:24.66]Actually, it's just awkward.
[18:28.30]Awkward.
[18:29.46]Awkward.
[18:30.80]Give me the vine.
[18:32.88]Give me that vine.
[18:33.44]There we go.
[18:35.33]Only a couple more meters left.
[18:36.31]And then I'll be at the end.
[18:40.85]Oh, that was a nice little ballerina move.
[18:45.15]Not going to really help me beat the level, but it's cute.
[18:48.82]I'll give you that.
[18:51.85]I so badly want to just get out of this game.
[18:54.28]Final stretch.
[19:01.10]Get your hand up there!
[19:02.32]I don't even care.
[19:07.95]I'm done.
[19:09.97]This one's gone.
[19:11.13]This one's gone.
[19:11.61]We eliminated the game.
[19:13.09]Game eliminated.
[19:14.81]Game eliminated.
[19:16.33]Let's find out what this one is before I capture Princess and the Frog.
[19:24.57]Alright, here it is.
[19:25.11]I'm going to full screen this.
[19:28.15]For like 10 seconds.
[19:33.29]Okay, let's get out of the cage.
[19:36.68]Only two frogs remain.
[19:43.08]Give me the cheat code.
[19:45.36]How many more cheat codes do I get?
[19:47.62]Wait until the hint is recharged.
[19:49.27]Shit, I should have been doing that the whole time.
[19:53.35]What do I have to do with a spoon?
[19:54.27]I got a spoon.
[19:58.58]If I throw the collar over the handbrake, I can lift the gate.
[20:10.45]Frog sorcery.
[20:11.87]It kind of is.
[20:13.21]Can I, like, break out with the spoon?
[20:16.99]There's 11 chapters.
[20:18.25]Can I just skip?
[20:18.89]Go to chapter 9.
[20:25.53]Oh, this is every single explanation.
[20:32.37]This is legit the entire cheatbook.
[20:35.61]A to B to C to Z. Use the spoon to remove tiles.
[20:40.09]Take the fork.
[20:40.87]Okay, use the spoon to remove the tiles.
[20:42.75]Use the spoon to remove tiles.
[20:48.74]Nice.
[20:49.04]Give me the fork.
[20:54.20]Nice.
[20:54.74]Okay.
[20:55.88]What's next?
[20:56.36]Take this, too.
[20:57.00]Grab that.
[20:57.44]It's a snake picture.
[20:58.84]These aren't frogs.
[21:03.05]On a triangle puzzle.
[21:06.87]Alright, now what?
[21:12.07]Okay, chapter one.
[21:13.79]Use spoon and root tiles.
[21:14.73]Use a fork.
[21:15.31]Collude with the puzzle in a triangle piece.
[21:17.04]Inspect the skeleton of a dog.
[21:18.66]Apply the fork on the skeleton.
[21:19.90]Got it.
[21:22.56]Fork on the skeleton.
[21:27.22]I would have never done that in a million years.
[21:32.76]Put the puzzle piece in the dog's mouth.
[21:35.45]Got the collar.
[21:36.87]Throw the collar over here.
[21:38.73]Pull the lever.
[21:41.41]Got out of the cage, boys and girls.
[21:47.16]There's the frog.
[21:47.64]There's the frog.
[21:48.04]There he is.
[21:48.32]There he is.
[21:51.56]We got to get him out of this cage.
[21:56.15]Okay, how do I get the frog out of the cage?
[21:57.23]This is important.
[21:59.71]That's some... What a weird cry.
[22:02.29]Okay, apply the... Okay, examine the prison.
[22:04.33]Expect that lever's J, pull lever K. Lever J, pull lever K. Expect lever J. Pull K. Got it.
[22:19.25]Take... Take the shoe.
[22:23.93]No.
[22:24.17]What do I do?
[22:24.97]Touch her.
[22:26.53]Touch the skeleton.

[24:37.29]I will get this to work.
[24:43.69]Now there's just a black screen.
[24:47.48]I just have to do monitor capture, right?
[24:49.58]It should work.
[24:52.44]That's what I'm going to try to do.
[24:55.66]Come on, monitor capture.
[24:57.86]Only one frog game left.
[25:02.88]What the fuck is going on here?
[25:16.45]Alright, there's that.
[25:19.83]Here it comes.
[25:21.85]Here it comes.
[25:25.17]Add.
[25:28.58]Monitor capture.
[25:34.00]Right?
[25:34.38]Okay, now how do I pick what monitor I want?
[25:37.76]Monitor 1.
[25:38.20]You're gonna see my wicked shitty desktop background.
[25:45.28]Alright, there it is.
[25:46.65]Alright, here we go.
[25:48.17]Time to go.
[25:52.35]Did it work?
[25:52.71]Didn't even work.
[25:57.39]No, it didn't work.
[25:58.19]This didn't even work.
[26:01.77]This didn't fucking work.
[26:06.61]Didn't work.
[26:07.67]Wait, what?
[26:08.75]Didn't fucking work.
[26:13.09]What, is this like the Eiffel Tower?
[26:16.91]I know, I know.
[26:17.53]I'm not stupid.
[26:18.91]Believe me.
[26:21.17]Hold on, let me... Properties.
[26:25.91]Is it like capture the whole monitor or something?
[26:34.32]It don't even matter.
[26:35.30]It's over.
[26:36.92]We're gonna go play something else.
[26:38.28]I can't even get it.
[26:38.81]There's no way.
[26:39.25]I did monitor capture.
[26:40.07]I did window capture.
[26:41.55]It's not gonna work.
[26:42.93]Game capture doesn't work.
[26:43.77]It doesn't even know the game exists.
[26:46.87]The game does not go into windowed mode.
[26:48.67]I can't do it.
[26:51.06]There's no windowed mode option for the princess and the frog.
[26:55.36]Well, guys.
[26:57.98]That was a good frog stream.
[27:01.44]Let me go ahead and delete this thing right here.
[27:04.13]We can just remove that.
[27:07.47]Okay.
[27:08.57]Hey!
[27:09.25]We're back out to the mystery stream.
[27:14.09]No, the stream's not over.
[27:14.95]It's not over.
[27:17.03]We're gonna do something else.
[27:18.95]First of all, let me just say thanks to all the people that have been playing... Playing?
[27:24.28]Playing bits?
[27:24.96]Like, what is this, a casino?
[27:29.90]Point your webcam at the... That's a wicked good idea!
[27:34.15]Wow.
[27:34.69]You just saved the whole stream.
[27:36.79]That guy just saved the fucking whole stream.
[27:38.23]I'm gonna point the webcam at the monitor.
[27:41.60]This is gonna be so stupid.
[27:47.06]Okay, you guys ready?
[27:50.36]Hold on a sec.
[27:51.47]Wait a second.
[27:52.03]I gotta, like, get this in my hand.
[28:20.06]Alright, here's the thing.
[28:21.04]I can't turn this around because I don't have any clothes on.
[28:23.56]I legit can't.
[28:24.26]If I turn this around, I'm going to get banned from Twitch.
[28:26.56]So, keep that in mind.
[28:28.58]If this webcam turns around for any reason, I am banned from this website.
[28:33.71]Fucking forever.
[28:37.13]Let's hope there's no nudity.
[28:38.77]Let's hope there's no mean nudity.
[28:42.23]Oh, my fucking head is killing me.
[28:43.97]This is worth it.
[28:47.27]Alright, so theoretically, right?
[28:50.31]Theoretically.
[28:52.92]This.
[28:53.24]I will prove to you.
[28:58.78]What the fuck is this?
[29:01.50]What is wrong with this image?
[29:04.28]This doesn't work.
[29:06.48]Hold on.
[29:07.06]What the fuck is going on here?
[29:15.32]There we go.
[29:18.74]I feel like an old Call of Duty kid from like 2007 that used to film his screen to make gameplay videos.
[29:30.66]I wonder how much of this I can tolerate.
[29:32.00]What do you guys think?
[29:32.80]Okay, Princess and the Frog, here it comes.
[29:42.86]Can you see it?
[29:45.00]Ah, shit, I can't.
[29:46.03]Hold on, I gotta move this.
[29:52.02]Over here.
[29:53.84]There we go.
[29:54.40]Now I should be able to see both.
[29:59.16]Look at all like the dust on my- like the shit on my screen.
[30:02.24]This is a wicked dusty ass room too.
[30:09.52]Alright, here we go.
[30:11.40]Ready?
[30:15.48]Stop spitting.
[30:16.24]It's like coffee stains on my screen.
[30:21.06]How do I even do this?
[30:24.30]See?
[30:24.68]I told you!
[30:26.90]I'm not controlling this, by the way.
[30:28.00]Well, I guess I am.
[30:36.05]Yeah, dude, that's like a whole day.
[30:37.81]Remember when I- Hey, guys, remember when I spit on the screen last night?
[30:41.31]I didn't clean it off.
[30:42.03]It's still there.
[30:46.46]Don't know what I was thinking.
[30:47.44]That just scared the shit out of me!
[30:54.06]Did anybody else just get the shit-skin out of him?
[30:56.98]Well, you always were a good cook, Tiana.
[31:00.36]Alright, how do I get... Where do I find the frog?
[31:06.70]I can't even get out of here.
[31:09.09]There's no getting out.
[31:14.99]Oh, I see a quest marker.
[31:19.05]Get that quest.
[31:23.72]That's...
[31:25.03]The show's over.
[31:26.01]The show's over.
[31:29.79]I'm not doing that anymore.
[31:31.01]I'm done with that.
[31:31.59]The fucking show's over.
[31:40.58]That's it.
[31:42.00]Game over.
[31:43.70]Starting soon.
[31:44.36]Let me see.
[31:48.22]Oh my god, dude.
[31:48.98]I just dragged my finger across my monitor.
[31:52.42]And... Like, it is as if somebody was smoking cigarettes and dumping the ashes on my monitor.
[31:58.84]This is fucking gross.
[32:05.57]Hey, that was fun, wasn't it?
[32:14.49]Clean your screen.
[32:15.15]It's a thing I, like, I do.
[32:16.69]Like, once every, like, week or two, I wipe this whole thing down.
[32:20.89]But, you know, the amount of times that I spit when I talk, the amount of times that I, like, dust in this room.
[32:27.60]Jeez.
[32:28.70]That is fucking gross.
[32:31.64]Actually, I cleaned this screen less than a week and a half ago.
[32:38.58]Specifically though, do you remember when I spit out coffee last night?
[32:42.01]I did it right into the screen.
[32:43.15]I just wiped it off with my hand.
[32:46.89]So there you go.
[32:47.47]That's why that happened.
[32:50.49]Alright, let's open up another game.
[32:52.77]This time, let me close Princess and the Frog.
[32:55.66]That's it.
[33:02.78]Well, that was four games.
[33:04.38]You got four games tonight.
[33:07.42]Clean it. Why are you monitoring your spit? I'm- I'm not I just bought that- I just pointed it at the screen and it was gross.
[33:14.42]Alright, you know, okay. Here's- here's what that just was.
[33:18.42]You know when somebody comes over your house and you're just you're not prepared for them to come to your room.
[33:21.42]Ou're not prepared for them to go into your bedroom.
[33:24.42]But for some reason they have to go in there, right?
[33:27.42]So shit, like you didn't clean your like bedroom and somebody has to go in there and they open the door and it's like this dirty laundry in the ground you're like...
[33:37.43]Agh, shit!
[33:38.67]And like it probably fucking stinks.
[33:39.79]You haven't done the laundry in, like, five days?
[33:43.94]That's what just happened.
[33:44.56]You guys just came into my bedroom.
[33:46.26]Like, I hadn't, like, done any cleaning in, like, a week or two.
[33:48.30]Okay.
[33:56.01]First of all, let me say...
[33:58.74]I missed a bunch of subs.
[34:00.84]And a bunch of bits.
[34:02.46]So thank you for all the people that just came in here and did that.
[34:05.18]Oh, Foss, thanks for five months, dude.
[34:07.15]Thanks, everybody, for these hundred bits.
[34:12.25]There's a lot of them.
[34:12.93]Jeez.
[34:15.33]A lot of them.
[34:19.13]Where's his mouth?
[34:21.85]Thank you, Danso1088.
[34:22.47]1018 for five months.
[34:23.00]Appreciate it.
[34:27.37]Thank you to Sir Jeg for a new subscription.
[34:30.61]Welcome, dude.
[34:32.41]Dango Slapper for nine months.
[34:33.83]Thanks a lot, dude.
[34:34.45]Thank you to Frugo for two months.
[34:36.97]Progress of Science.
[34:38.89]Thanks for the sub.
[34:39.87]And then all these bits that came in, thanks to the guys for giving the bits.
[34:43.79]Do you want me to, like, stream me cleaning the monitor?
[34:46.93]Fine.
[34:49.33]No!
[34:49.79]No, I have to put clothes on.
[34:51.04]That's not going to happen.
[34:53.34]I promise I'll clean my dirty, spit, dust, crap screen when it's over.
[35:06.38]Play Dark Messiah, Might and Magic.
[35:08.58]Ah, shit.
[35:09.08]Everybody wants me to fucking do this.
[35:10.46]God.
[35:11.66]How am I going to set this up?
[35:12.68]It's going to take even longer to set up, you know.
[35:18.96]Clean your screen and show us dirty nudes.
[35:20.76]Do it nude.
[35:22.86]We're on the wrong website for that.
[35:24.54]Unfortunately.
[35:25.20]What do you mean unfortunately?
[35:26.60]No, fortunately.
[35:27.48]No, I'm gonna like play Dark Souls again or something.
[35:29.82]I fucking got underwear on.
[35:34.99]I look like shit.
[35:36.27]I gotta like shave.
[35:40.73]Is it over already?
[35:41.45]No, it's not over.
[35:45.17]What dumb game do I have that I can just play that's not like Dark Souls?
[35:54.98]Princess and the Frog is still running.
[35:56.52]I can't close it.
[36:01.83]I cannot close this.
[36:08.23]Let's go play Doom.
[36:12.33]Dude, the new Skyrim?
[36:18.13]My head is like... I have a terrible headache now after that.
[36:29.39]Pull, pull, pull.
[36:34.83]Oh, jeez.
[36:35.37]Everyone's like... I've seen so much... Play Dark Messiah, Might and Magic.
[36:41.81]Why do you guys want to play that so bad?
[36:43.36]Stardew Valley, Minesweeper.
[36:48.04]I could just chill and do Stardew Valley.
[36:51.54]Because, like I said, I'm not feeling well.
[36:53.34]That's all I had planned.
[36:59.29]I knew I was like, wasn't feeling well today, but I still wanted to stream.
[37:02.76]And I was like, hey, what if I just stream like four fucking frog games?
[37:05.46]That was the whole plan.
[37:06.86]So it's been about 40 minutes.
[37:09.78]So, if you came out here for that, thanks for coming out.
[37:14.85]Because now I'm just going to hang out and be like sick, tired, headache boy and play Starter Valley.
[37:22.97]Frogdo Valley?
[37:24.31]Play more Handsome Frog?
[37:28.05]You know, I could play Handsome Frog.
[37:29.17]Handsome Frog actually, like, seemed kind of fun.
[37:33.83]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[37:35.33]Here's what we're gonna do.
[37:36.49]For the next, like, so odd time, I'm gonna play... I'm gonna actually try to play Handsome Frog.
[37:45.76]And then, before the stream ends, I'm gonna clean my monitor.
[37:49.62]On stream.
[37:50.06]I'm gonna clean it with, like, Windex.
[37:52.68]Except you're not supposed to use that.
[37:56.23]So there we go.
[37:57.03]That's the plan for the next, like, 30 minutes before I, like, go lie down again.
[38:03.79]If you don't play Stardew, I'm unsubscribing.
[38:05.99]Oh my goodness.
[38:10.40]I came here for frog games.
[38:14.66]Let's open up Handsome Frog again.
[38:15.98]Yeah, that's all I had planned.
[38:19.42]Sorcery is going to take too much out of me.
[38:23.59]And within like 10 to 20 minutes of playing Sorcery, I would definitely need to leave.
[38:33.29]I can already feel like the back of my left eye is starting to be like, it's time for you to go lie down again.
[38:41.35]Alright, we're gonna do Handsome Frog.
[38:43.99]And then play that until I can figure out what the hell is even part of this game.
[38:50.20]And then I'm gonna clean my screen.
[38:55.50]So, this theoretically should still be on the screen, right?
[39:03.58]This is supposed to be a frog stream.
[39:05.08]I'm gonna keep it a frog stream.
[39:10.31]He's getting old.
[39:11.19]No, I'm getting sick.
[39:13.05]The weekend of Halloween, too, and I have a lot of things planned.
[39:18.21]Who cares?
[39:19.11]It's just a frog game.
[39:20.07]It could be, like, right there.
[39:25.78]Alright.
[39:26.44]Let's play Fantastic Mr. Frog.
[39:27.86]Can I use a controller for this?
[39:29.00]I don't think so.
[39:35.93]This is actually much easier to see, though.
[39:45.76]Actually, I preferred it when it was a tiny screen.
[39:51.77]What a handsome frog.
[39:53.47]There we go.
[39:58.39]Come on, jump into me.
[39:59.31]Alright, I gotta admit, Z and X's jump and mouth, I can't do it.
[40:09.43]I cannot play this game unless I have a controller.
[40:12.53]Jumping with X and shooting with Z. Not gonna happen.
[40:18.61]I almost wish it was reversed.
[40:19.87]Can I change the controls in this game?
[40:21.11]Yeah, I'm trying to jump with Z. Quit game.
[40:29.36]Where's the options?
[40:34.96]I want to change this.
[40:38.81]X, A. A. Why do you want me to press A?
[40:47.21]Come on, let me use my controller.
[40:54.05]Quitter?
[40:55.53]No, I'm not quitting.
[40:56.80]I guess I have to deal with it.
[40:57.88]Alright, we're not going to try.
[41:02.34]We're going to just not jump.
[41:10.10]Oh yeah, super frog!
[41:16.97]That was a combo right there, that was kinda cool.
[41:21.69]Literally two options.
[41:22.80]Well, to be fair, I'm gonna be very fair right now.
[41:25.68]This game is not even a dollar.
[41:28.78]Handsome Frog is not even one fucking dollar.
[41:33.74]So, it's okay.
[41:35.39]It's okay.
[41:36.85]Holy shit, these guys are fast.
[41:37.95]What?
[41:48.42]You know, how much can you ask for, for like 88 cents?
[41:50.76]What's that?
[41:52.82]Give me the candy.
[41:59.40]Extra live?
[42:01.18]Very handsome.
[42:09.23]Ah!
[42:10.11]Gotta get some screen wipes.
[42:14.57]Yeah, I'm gonna clean the screen.
[42:20.53]I will do that on stream, I promise.
[42:22.11]How could you not like it?
[42:25.89]It's got candy!
[42:26.65]Oh fuck, this is really messing me up.
[42:33.40]I like the music.
[42:34.20]If I could use a controller for this game... I mean, I can.
[42:43.93]I could just use Input Mapper, couldn't I?
[42:46.77]Yeah, hold on.
[42:48.09]Wait, wait, wait.
[42:48.59]Give me one second here.
[42:51.02]I'm going to do input mapper.
[42:56.92]Makes sense, right?
[42:59.47]I need X and A. X and Z, actually.
[43:02.17]Here we go.
[43:04.13]Handsome Mr. Frog has crashed.
[43:06.23]But it's okay.
[43:07.75]Oh, no.
[43:08.53]Oh, boy.
[43:08.89]Oh, boy.
[43:12.55]Alright, new profile.
[43:18.60]We need this to be
[43:25.39]left.
[43:29.47]I love I'm taking this much time to make sure I can play handsome frog at a level that's not terrible.
[43:37.66]And then square is going to be z. And then x is going to be x. Alright, let's give it a try again.
[43:55.15]This time I'm going to play Handsome Frog.
[43:59.25]For real this time.
[44:00.41]None of this bullshit where I don't play it for real.
[44:06.31]Please play something else.
[44:08.97]I told you, that's all I had planned.
[44:11.54]I'm going to clean my screen and go to bed.
[44:13.20]There we go.
[44:15.04]That's what I'm talking about.
[44:16.08]This is going to be awesome.
[44:18.50]I'm ready.
[44:21.02]I'm now ready to take on the world of Super Frog.
[44:31.96]Fuck, I'm trying to get the candy.
[44:34.72]Anything else?
[44:35.52]No, we're playing Super Candy Frog.
[44:39.43]Until I get to wave 10.
[44:45.63]I would play Frog Fractions, even though I'm probably... Dude, I'm so bad at math, I wouldn't even be able to do the children's Frog Fraction game.

[47:49.03]No, I don't think I would embarrass myself.
[47:51.05]Because I don't even know fractions.
[47:54.69]I failed almost every single test in high school.
[47:58.38]For algebra and geometry and all that shit.
[48:00.58]I don't even know what they are.
[48:02.22]If you ask me what 1 fourth of 6 is, I don't know.
[48:08.22]It's 2.
[48:08.54]No, it's not.
[48:10.06]It's like 1.4 or something.

[48:30.93]I swear to goodness of gracious.
[48:35.57]Oh my god, I'm like reading the chat.

[51:51.52]Ready?
[51:51.98]This is what I'm talking about.
[51:57.23]Frog fractions?
[51:59.71]This is not a real game.
[52:08.41]Oh, Frog Fractions, what a great kid's game.
[52:12.59]Revolutionary, the absolute best way to teach your child about fractions.
[52:15.96]Oh, wow.
[52:16.88]It's on this random website.
[52:19.68]Comets were killing to play Frog Fractions.
[52:25.96]I'm terrified to click this, because it's going to be like, oh, welcome to Frog Fractions.
[52:29.88]What's two plus?
[52:30.74]And it's going to be like fucking heavy metal is going to start.
[52:33.00]It's going to show me like some dude's head exploding or something.
[52:44.38]Alright, I'm gonna need a mod to tell me that this is... I've never played this.
[52:48.78]I've never done this.
[52:49.44]Is this like a joke or is this actually like a fun children's game?
[52:58.55]Oh, it is.
[52:59.09]Okay.
[53:00.41]Wave one.
[53:00.95]I don't get it.
[53:08.02]Seven eighths.
[53:10.64]I don't understand what I'm doing here.
[53:15.46]One half.
[53:16.56]Seven.
[53:22.00]I don't... What is this?
[53:24.36]How is this frog fractions?
[53:34.22]I'm so scared this is going to be a gameplay with porn.
[53:36.96]Is that a cling tongue?
[53:48.52]Do I need to do something in particular?
[53:51.72]Or just play line defense with bugs?
[54:02.14]I don't even need to know fractions?
[54:06.40]I don't want to play this.
[54:09.56]This is great porn.
[54:17.75]Upgrade your fruit to durians.
[54:20.10]Upgrade your lily pad to a turtle friend.
[54:21.86]Okay.
[54:33.97]Cool.
[54:35.19]Can I lose this game?
[54:39.95]Actually, it's kind of satisfying.
[54:43.33]What even happened to those?
[54:44.68]They shouldn't have fallen.
[54:51.91]Why did that fall?
[54:52.61]There was no reason for that to fall.
[55:00.06]This has to get better, right?
[55:04.58]This eyeball installed auto targeting HUD helps you make a glowy red list of bugs you hate?
[55:09.12]Okay.
[55:14.38]Thanks a lot, dude.
[55:15.32]Oh, whoa!
[55:18.63]Well, I just found, like, the easy way to play the game.
[55:28.71]Frog Fractions.
[55:33.01]Uninstall lock-on.
[55:34.45]Targeting too expensive.
[55:36.17]Chicks don't dig on cyborgs, and it makes licking bugs less fun anyway.
[55:40.60]Get the surgeon to uninstall it.
[55:44.20]Let's get the friend.
[55:45.89]WASD?
[55:54.07]No, I want to get the... Stop clicking out of the window!
[55:56.97]I can't wait until I actually get to the end of the game.
[56:05.35]And it's like one of those existential... ...teaches typing.
[56:08.39]What?
[56:12.15]Got him.
[56:18.10]I'm such a bad typer.

[56:42.85]Upgrade the fruits.
[56:45.75]Now they have bigger fruits.

[56:56.36]Why am I having fun doing this?
[57:07.42]Did it say too easy?
[57:12.38]How is this fractions again?
[57:13.44]Yeah, how is this frog fractions?
[57:18.27]They're making a Frog Fractions 2, apparently.
[57:20.19]Okay.

[57:32.25]How many if I have nine fruits?
[57:35.52]I can't really do anything, can I?
[57:39.48]Jeremy, please just stop streaming.
[57:41.42]Why?

[61:28.67]What do they represent?
[61:29.41]Bugs.
[61:31.19]A little bit on the nose, isn't it?
[61:32.34]You can blame Bug Betsy Ross for that one.
[61:34.22]Next question on the series.

[62:07.89]Oh man, I love them.
[62:12.88]The bug stream.
[62:13.74]Yeah, this used to be a frog stream.
[62:15.02]It still is a frog stream.
[62:18.98]Don't do it.
[62:21.16]Uh, bugs, bugs, bugs.
[62:25.28]I gotta do my working holiday Visa.
[62:30.97]I was about to just write a very bad word.
[62:35.17]I was about to write something terrible.
[62:38.89]Uh...
[62:41.37]I was just gonna, and then I was just gonna do my signature, but I'm like, hold on a second, I don't wanna do my signature.
[62:46.93]Somebody could, like, steal my identity. ...
[63:15.60]Fred.
[63:18.83]Write not your signature then.
[63:20.25]It's impossible not to write your signature.
[63:24.63]Oh, by the way, I know I'm missing subs and people throwing in some bits and shit like that.
[63:29.06]I kinda can't see because I'm doing this dumb monitor capture thing.
[63:34.80]So when I'm done with this, I will go through and say hello to all the people that are here right now.
[63:41.86]I think I have to keep doing this.
[63:44.25]Too expensive.
[63:45.11]How much is it then?
[63:49.95]2,000 Zorkmids?
[63:56.50]I took off a lock.
[63:57.52]Okay.
[63:59.08]How do I get Zorkmids?

[64:16.74]How is he not learned?
[64:17.96]Fuck, do I just gotta go down again?
[64:19.24]What the fuck?
[64:25.28]This game is so stupid.
[64:29.22]But it's charming for some reason.
[64:34.10]Oh my god.
[64:34.36]I don't... What have I gotten myself into right now?
[64:36.54]Okay, this is where the porn comes in.
[64:38.10]Here comes the porn.
[64:39.26]I knew it.
[64:39.74]How long is this game?
[65:07.81]This game is too long.
[65:11.67]But I guess that's the point, right?
[65:16.14]We're gonna go right.
[65:16.70]Let me like turn it up.
[65:21.82]After seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down.
[65:32.18]Told you about the porn.
[65:32.84]See?
[65:32.92]Told you about the porno.
[65:34.16]What is going on?
[65:35.58]Bad ending?
[65:35.86]You went right.
[65:36.48]There comes the screamer.
[65:37.20]What the fuck?
[65:37.66]I don't want to go all the way back there.
[65:39.42]Give me the cheat code strategy.
[66:00.69]I knew it.
[66:02.03]See, I was like licking this old guy's face.
[66:03.69]That's definitely grounds for getting banned.
[66:07.87]Ban him!
[66:08.33]Banned!
[66:09.15]Banned for life.
[66:19.11]Frog fractions.
[66:20.41]I can't believe that frog fractions is a thing that I never knew about.
[66:27.86]When did this come out?
[66:34.39]I hope I'm going the right way.
[66:35.37]Oh, my boy.
[66:38.80]My boy.
[66:41.62]Don't ban him.
[66:42.63]Don't ban him yet.
[66:43.29]He's at the end of the game.
[66:47.63]This is right.
[66:48.09]I don't even know what's going on.
[66:49.05]Is there a story that I'm missing, or is this guy just talking total nonsense paragraphs?
[67:09.69]Get me out of here.
[67:11.00]Get the fuck out of here.
[67:11.86]Am I going back to the fat guy in the chair?
[67:14.32]Yes, I am.
[67:28.41]Today's boxing enthusiasts fantasize about a newcomer that would rock the ring.
[67:33.35]No more of this.
[67:35.48]No more.
[67:37.06]I'd rather lick the bugs.
[67:40.32]It's easy to get caught up in the fantasy.
[67:43.26]Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new tricks... Gotta get the lore.
[67:48.06]...usually a variant of hypnosis.
[67:50.41]And though they've achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough... There's a dead end.
[67:57.13]Where is it?
[67:57.65]Yeah, it is.
[67:58.37]Shit.
[68:02.59]Well, it is a frog stream.
[68:04.17]That is correct.
[68:05.62]That hasn't changed.
[68:21.42]Jeremy please just stop doing everything I don't have an off switch
[68:31.35]I think I went down the wrong hole.
[68:32.53]This is the right one.
[68:33.33]Alright, this guy in the chat just wrote, I think I hate this game.
[68:35.37]I think I hate this game.
[68:36.21]I just glanced over and see that.
[68:37.23]That's funny.
[69:00.78]You know, I am learning about fractions.
[69:06.38]More importantly, I'm glad I don't care about... I made it!
[69:09.67]I made it to the submarine.
[69:11.57]Alright.
[69:24.41]Command... Oh, no.
[69:25.37]What are you... Uh...
[69:31.86]What the fuck is this shit?
[69:36.14]There's a text game now.
[69:38.04]Look around.
[69:38.88]Examine ball.
[69:40.64]Inventory.

[69:42.38]Push button.
[69:43.16]Get into phone booth.
[69:46.30]Ugh.
[69:50.87]Remember the adventures.
[69:52.11]Gamers maximum.
[69:52.81]It's impossible to do.
[69:53.61]It must be.
[69:54.55]Ugh.
[70:00.35]Look.
[70:07.37]Zaf!
[70:10.99]I don't like the... This is gonna take a... This is gonna be like a four hour long game, isn't it?
[70:21.22]Okay, lighting... Lining the walls, you see a porthole.
[70:24.04]Okay, here comes the hole.
[70:25.56]There's a control deck, a ladder leads... Aft.
[70:32.62]Climb.
[70:37.09]Ladder.
[70:39.39]Help.
[70:44.18]Turn knob.
[70:45.04]No.
[70:45.26]Eye.
[70:47.92]Not holding anything.
[70:50.50]Pour orange juice into glass.
[70:59.34]What?
[71:01.01]I don't get it.
[71:01.45]Climb stairs?
[71:02.21]Climb stairs?
[71:09.07]Turn it.
[71:11.23]Turn knob.
[71:11.53]Help.
[71:14.16]Turn knob.
[71:21.15]Turn knob.
[71:35.81]Honestly, I was frozen right there and my mouth was open and I was just staring at the screen.
[72:00.23]I already typed that!
[72:01.33]It didn't do anything!
[72:17.77]Sleep?
[72:26.78]Climb the ladder.
[72:27.44]I did climb the ladder.
[72:30.58]You typed climb and you typed ladder.
[72:33.58]Climb stairs.
[72:34.42]Alright, give me the cheat codes.
[72:38.22]I don't even care.
[72:39.02]What's the cheat?
[72:40.04]What do I type next?
[72:41.04]I don't give a flying fuck.
[72:52.54]What is the next thing to write?
[72:55.05]Find porn.
[72:57.85]Take rug.
[72:59.53]No, take rug.
[73:03.35]Got it.
[73:05.09]Open hatch.
[73:10.86]Go in.
[73:12.28]In hatch.
[73:13.96]Climb hatch.
