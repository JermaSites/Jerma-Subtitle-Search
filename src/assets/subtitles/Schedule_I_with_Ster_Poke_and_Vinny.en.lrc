[02:46.79]yeah we should no this drug is actually bad no wait no I'm not gonna say anything cool you might not know like the real meta we might find like the new meta probably so how do we join a lobby does somebody just have one open uh you gotta make a lobby I think and then we just join you on the main menu so who wants to make the game because I'm the only one that hasn't played it uh whoever has done the most drugs oh um
[03:18.41]We might need to figure that out.
[03:24.75]I mean, it's not me.
[03:27.63]I mean, Vinny's muted.
[03:31.17]What's he doing?
[03:31.59]I think he's doing something.
[03:33.39]I think he's doing something right now.
[03:36.67]Yeah, that's what I think.
[03:38.49]I wanted to have a couple of beers, but I don't have any beers right now.
[03:44.65]I don't know why that's so funny.
[03:46.63]I'll get a beer.
[03:47.78]You got a beer?
[03:49.18]I'll find something.
[03:49.88]I think I have a random alcohol in my closet.
[03:53.80]Really?
[03:54.08]I don't want to drink something like old ass shit alcohol that I have.
[03:59.30]I got alcohol in my closet too, but I don't know.
[04:01.14]I feel like I don't want it.
[04:02.53]It's like not fresh.
[04:03.37]I haven't drank in a long time.
[04:08.57]What if I just start talking so much?
[04:13.71]That's fine.
[04:14.71]Ugh.
[04:21.71]Yo, I'll see if I have something.
[04:23.67]Let me see if I have something light.
[04:24.69]Maybe some sake.
[04:26.21]What?
[04:27.03]You got sake on tap?
[04:28.75]He has it like in one of the like a vending machine, not the soda machine.
[04:34.36]He just has it ready.
[04:39.70]I've got these drinks that are like soda and they taste like apple.
[04:46.64]Dude, I got like wine that's got cobwebs all over it.
[04:49.90]I don't even know if it's good.
[04:52.22]Doesn't that make it more expensive?
[04:53.92]Yeah, I don't know.
[04:54.46]I guess maybe.
[04:58.13]More cobwebs, more taste?
[05:00.13]I feel like this thing is fermented to a point where it's going to be like kombucha.
[05:04.41]It's not even going to be wine anymore.
[05:07.87]Wait, wine with cobwebs?
[05:10.85]We were contemplating if anybody had... Well, first of all, Ster asked who did the most rugs.
[05:15.57]So who should host the game?
[05:19.26]um what counts as a drug that's what we have to figure out uh anything even prescribed by a doctor wait what yeah that's the twist that's the twist oh yeah you don't think those are count as drugs just because the government says they're okay for use depends on what it does to your brain I think
[05:47.02]I mean, they're a lot less processed than, like, marijuana.
[05:48.87]That's just a plant.
[05:51.65]No, I just found really weird, strong stuff.
[05:53.69]I'm not drinking that.
[05:54.51]Gin?
[05:56.05]Bombay gin?
[05:56.99]No, I don't know.
[05:59.27]Yeah, crack it open with the gin.
[06:01.69]I don't know.
[06:04.43]Gin just tastes like floor cleaner.
[06:05.89]I don't know.
[06:06.81]Yeah.
[06:08.97]Yeah, no thanks.
[06:11.15]Invite me.
[06:12.86]Alright, so- But no one has- no one has made- Okay, it looks like I've done the most rugs, sir.
[06:16.88]Okay, I- I've done- okay, I've- I've- listen, I have consumed a weed in my lifetime, and I also did a Mario mushroom, and I believed in ghosts for like two months after I did that.
[06:27.86]Oh, okay.
[06:28.60]It might be you.
[06:29.18]Have you ever streamed high?
[06:31.83]No comment.
[06:34.33]Uh, well, as somebody that used to all the time, and does not anymore, uh...
[06:39.56]It got to a point where it was difficult.
[06:41.10]We could tell.
[06:44.46]Yo, I have to ask this.
[06:47.08]Sorry.
[06:47.76]Sorry to Ster in Vinny.
[06:51.10]Jerma.
[06:51.80]What's up?
[06:52.14]The Devil May Cry a loud sound.
[06:54.00]That wasn't on purpose?
[06:55.74]No, it was not on purpose.
[06:56.78]Oh my God.
[06:57.30]I would never do that to anybody on purpose.
[07:00.25]My theory is you were just like that was your idea the whole day like now I'm gonna play this game I can't wait to get four hours in to hit the fucking nuke.
[07:07.51]No like oh that I saw that clip.
[07:10.09]Yeah That's Modern warfare to do that to people.
[07:14.87]That's it's a new convention if you did that on purpose.
[07:17.25]It's apparently an incredibly rare bug I don't know.
[07:21.63]I it's the worst bug I've ever experienced in 40 years of playing video games.
[07:26.15]It was the worst thing I've ever experienced
[07:29.03]I saw it the other day.
[07:29.63]I just... I thought you did it on purpose.
[07:33.33]It was amazing.
[07:34.17]It was actually an amazing clip.
[07:37.13]The best part, the best take I heard about it is it sounds like somebody threw a grenade into my room.
[07:42.26]Because you hear the glass shatter.
[07:45.02]It's like... Oh my...
[07:49.45]I can't invite anybody.
[07:50.35]I don't know why.
[07:50.99]Oh, there we go.
[07:51.53]I tried to invite you guys.
[07:54.33]I'll host the lobby.
[07:55.42]I'll do the most drugs.
[07:57.16]Did I invite you?
[07:59.48]Vineyard Vinny is offline.
[08:02.14]Sorry, I always forget about that.
[08:04.26]It's the drugs that makes me forget.
[08:06.52]I know.
[08:06.88]Hey, did you invite?
[08:07.43]I did.
[08:09.63]I did.
[08:10.13]I'll do it again.
[08:11.61]Invite?
[08:11.91]Oh, dude.
[08:14.81]So many drugs.
[08:19.34]I've only done weed.
[08:19.88]Oh, smoke the weed.
[08:21.78]And like shrooms one time.
[08:24.06]Yeah.
[08:25.01]Yeah, I think for me that was a two-time thing.
[08:28.07]Those things there.
[08:29.39]Shrooms scared the shit out of me.
[08:30.51]I feel like I would take shrooms and I just would never come back.
[08:33.46]I would just start flying into outer space and I would never come back.
[08:36.30]I think I'm good on those forever, honestly.
[08:38.40]Those two times were enough for me.
[08:40.08]Yeah, never.
[08:40.66]Yeah, I did have a water park.
[08:43.72]Oh my god.
[08:45.88]What was that like?
[08:46.64]I don't know.
[08:48.82]I don't remember.
[08:51.18]I don't know.
[08:52.56]I feel like when I'm in water, I sober up.
[08:54.79]It wasn't that bad.
[08:57.35]Do you soak in more water and dilute it?
[09:00.01]I don't know.
[09:01.65]If I just go shower, I just feel normal after.
[09:03.85]It just removes my buffs.
[09:06.71]Okay.
[09:07.87]That's a great description.
[09:09.69]That is the best way to describe that.
[09:13.60]It's weird.
[09:14.30]It says launching.
[09:16.56]You're the only one.
[09:17.74]It doesn't join.
[09:18.42]Do I have to quit out of the game first?
[09:24.24]I don't think so.
[09:25.44]No, I think you make a character once you get in.
[09:30.25]Oh, I didn't do the tutorial.
[09:31.55]Is that bad?
[09:34.95]I didn't either if we need to.
[09:37.36]poke is the tutorial I don't want to be the tutorial guy though I'll try just like the basics like press e to interact with weeds okay yeah I'll try this we can skip the prologue okay uh someone else the prologue isn't bad if how are you guys I would go do it real quick let's go do the prologue actually a good story yeah I I think it's worth it okay well you could do the tutorial as a group
[10:06.62]I can press new game, I don't know, Ster do you have like control of this?
[10:10.50]I can click new game but I'm waiting for Vineyard Vinny.
[10:14.18]Oh apparently we do it together I think.
[10:19.21]Yeah I think Vinny just needs to join.
[10:22.53]Sweet.
[10:27.32]Okay sorry.
[10:28.76]I'm trying to get to the main menu, do I have to make a character first?
[10:33.54]Or is that in game?
[10:35.18]I didn't need to.
[10:37.60]Did I open this before?
[10:39.50]I have a continue here, but I didn't play this yet.
[10:42.16]I have a continue too, but I also haven't played it.
[10:43.99]We all have it.
[10:45.01]What's the issue?

[18:36.62]Yeah, you're not really chill right now.
[18:38.44]You need to chill.
[18:39.02]This is a game about selling weed.
[18:41.22]You need to chill out.
[18:42.74]You're being the guy that goes to the hospital from one joint.
[18:49.43]I accidentally gave him my plant trimmers.
[18:53.71]Maybe he can use those and start his own business.
[18:55.79]Then you can start selling, you know, his stuff.
[19:03.12]One time I passed out at a Wendy's because I smoked too much weed.
[19:06.24]Wait, really?
[19:09.76]Yeah.
[19:10.43]Wait, what?
[19:11.47]Yeah, I was like 17, 16.
[19:13.45]The only thing I ever do when I smoke weed is I get a whiteboard out and I just start writing about what I thought about the Bible.
[19:22.47]Oh, man.
[19:23.29]Like, no, you do.
[19:24.35]Oh, no, all the time.
[19:25.59]All the time.
[19:26.17]All the time.
[19:26.49]It's just like, oh, man, you know the story of Job?
[19:28.51]Like, man, what's going on with that?
[19:31.23]And then I get like a whiteboard out and start writing about like a dude who made the first sauce was one that I really was into.
[19:37.45]Like any kind of sauce.
[19:38.78]You did talk about the first sauce for like a month.
[19:40.92]Yeah.
[19:41.80]Who made the first sauce?
[19:44.14]Well, who made the first sauce?
[19:45.14]Yeah, who made the first sauce?
[19:46.16]Why the fuck would you do that?
[19:47.04]Back in the caveman times, it was like meat cook on fire.
[19:49.52]Why would you make like a roux?
[19:52.70]Who made the first sauce?
[19:53.62]For what reason?
[19:55.15]Maybe his food got rained on and he liked the way it was soaked.
[19:58.93]Yeah.
[20:00.25]Maybe.
[20:01.05]That's not a bad... That's not a bad way to go about it.
[20:03.45]Just like, like, sauce slop.
[20:07.59]My chicken wet.
[20:09.55]This is delicious wet chicken.
[20:11.99]I feel like that would be gross.
[20:14.59]Yeah, but the one caveman liked it more.
[20:17.53]And he really pushed the idea.
[20:18.45]It's raining.
[20:22.91]What else are they going to put on their dino nuggies?
[20:27.64]Did I talk about that last week?
[20:29.38]I don't know.
[20:29.87]Maybe.
[20:30.15]Hey, you know, people gave me shit for that today too earlier.
[20:32.99]Hey, you know what?
[20:35.49]Like I said, like Poke, how many times do you think, how many times do you think you've streamed in your life?
[20:41.03]Like how many hours have you been talking?
[20:44.46]Fuck.
[20:48.30]A lot, like 30%.
[20:50.45]We're talking about hundreds of millions of words that you've probably said over the last decade.
[20:55.27]Probably a hundred million.
[20:57.00]Yeah.
[20:57.60]You're going to probably repeat yourself a few times in a hundred million sentences.
[21:02.76]Yeah.
[21:03.74]No.
[21:04.52]I call them reruns, Jerma.
[21:06.38]Yeah.
[21:06.62]When I tell a story to my chat that I told ten years ago, they say we've heard this one already.
[21:10.58]Oh, yeah.
[21:11.48]Same one story.
[21:12.54]Same one story.
[21:13.30]Same one shorts, too.
[21:14.50]Because I don't know.
[21:17.23]why you gotta make shit up like passing out at the Wendy's that never happened what am I doing with chelsea we gotta give a sample oh give her a free sample just a free one you're the doctor I feel like that's I shouldn't have done that well how are you gonna make business I don't maybe I shouldn't I wish you're gonna know how sticky your icky is
[21:44.50]Yeah, dude.

[24:42.57]We can hold an item to conceal it.
[24:50.51]Oops.
[24:51.79]You don't need to conceal soil.
[24:54.69]Don't look at that.
[24:56.53]Wait, I drove home because Poke told me to drive home.
[24:59.66]That's not the motel.
[25:01.88]Wait, did I tell you to do the wrong step?
[25:04.70]I think so.
[25:05.62]I think I got trolled.
[25:07.40]Whose wheelchair is this?
[25:08.58]Oh, I did.
[25:13.10]I got played.

[25:18.42]Oh, that's a good idea.
[25:19.32]No, I have a side of desk.
[25:21.28]I have a little ottoman that you could store stuff in.
[25:23.72]And I use that.
[25:24.80]Dude, I got this new product.
[25:26.79]It's literally a little thing that goes... You click it up, you click it down, you can make it any angle you want.
[25:32.25]Or under the desk, put your feet up.
[25:34.19]It's... What a godsend.
[25:35.43]It's great.
[25:38.09]That's cool.
[25:39.09]I would like to know more about this product.
[25:41.72]It's exciting.
[25:42.94]I like product.
[25:45.10]Like product?
[25:46.26]Like hair product?
[25:47.06]I feel like if you say product, we're talking to hair product.
[25:49.58]No, any product.
[25:50.78]Just, I like products.
[25:52.62]I got a haircut one time.
[25:55.04]And then the person at the end said, would you like any product for the road?
[25:58.26]And I've been thinking about that for about 10 years.
[26:02.01]It's like, right, yeah.
[26:03.09]It's just such a weird sentence.
[26:05.41]Until they get you, bro.
[26:07.35]Until they get you.
[26:08.95]Now you're a product addict.
[26:11.03]What?
[26:12.48]I just needed a little bit for the road, and now every time I need it.
[26:17.09]Well, you never know.
[26:18.01]Haircutters are the real drug dealers.
[26:20.49]Some people get their haircut and go do something.
[26:26.23]So maybe it's like, hey, you want some product for, you know, what if you got like a date or something?
[26:29.44]I don't know.
[26:35.74]Plant a weed seed.
[26:38.42]Music is cool in this game.
[26:39.56]I have to lower it a little bit.
[26:41.09]Dude, this is gonna stink.
[26:56.36]Alright, well I'm waking up at 7am.
[27:01.76]Okay, I'm so far behind.
[27:04.66]You're kind of spoiling it that I'm going to have to wake up.
[27:10.28]I won't say anything else.
[27:15.32]You know what?
[27:16.36]Some of the little details in this game are surprisingly nice.
[27:21.66]When you plant the seed and stuff, it's cool.
[27:23.30]I'm telling you, this is where video game graphics needed to cap out.
[27:30.12]Yeah.
[27:31.16]Yeah.
[27:34.48]Oh, now it says waiting for host to finish loading.
[27:39.03]Yeah, same.
[27:41.76]Been here for a while, dude.
[27:43.30]Wait, I missed one?
[27:47.86]We can chill, it's fine.
[27:51.48]It's not fine.
[27:53.65]Alright, what step you on?
[27:54.51]Let me help you out.
[27:54.97]I can help you with anything you want.
[27:56.93]Oh, he's got it.
[28:02.43]Alright, I'm good.
[28:04.24]Diet Coke or Coke Zero?
[28:06.71]Diet Coke.
[28:07.51]Diet Coke.
[28:08.09]That's one for Diet Coke.
[28:08.87]What about... I just... First thing pops in your head.
[28:11.29]I don't know... I don't know the difference.
[28:13.59]I have not had them in years.
[28:15.38]Alright, Ster.
[28:20.14]Oh no, you're busy.
[28:21.12]You're busy.
[28:22.12]I don't like soda much.
[28:24.80]Neither.
[28:25.14]Can I just say neither?
[28:26.82]Yeah, you can.
[28:28.32]So, Poke, that means that you and I have to have a little debate.
[28:34.53]You like Coke Zero?
[28:35.93]I don't like diet soda I don't like coke zero but if I would if I were to drink one it would probably be coke zero well my father liked diet coke when I was younger and I never really liked it and then I started drinking it because he did I don't know I was like damn this kind of hit him yeah and then the aspartame I realized that's that's just very addictive
[28:59.04]It's just like, it's just, it's its own chemical that your body binds and needs.
[29:03.69]When you drink Diet Coke, it just, it's so good and nothing tastes like it.
[29:07.13]Coke Zero, nothing.
[29:08.67]Poop.
[29:09.45]Yeah, I get it.
[29:11.53]So diet soda to me, the only reason why I don't love diet soda or Diet Coke, Diet Coke is kind of, this is why I know a lot of people like it, but it kind of tastes like sweet air.
[29:23.53]Like when you drank a Diet Coke, you take a sip and it's just like after a second or two, it's just sweet air.
[29:30.51]It's like a very airy sweetness.
[29:33.95]Isn't Diet Coke the same as vaping?
[29:37.82]I don't know.
[29:41.00]You guys waking up?
[29:41.48]Same thing.
[29:42.30]Same thing.
[29:42.84]And it's funny, my mother, when you mentioned family stuff, my mother drinks Coke Zero.
[29:48.29]So I tried it through her and was like, oh, actually, it's kind of good.
[29:52.37]So realistically, it's my mother that likes it.
[29:58.95]Well, I heard they made Coke Zero because men won't like the diet and drinks.
[30:03.08]So it's technically the same.
[30:05.34]Oh, because it sounds like awesome.
[30:07.44]Yeah, I heard it was like a marketing thing.
[30:08.96]Coke Zero.
[30:11.25]And they just kept diet for like, because of the way it worked.
[30:14.31]So they just have both.
[30:14.87]That's crazy.
[30:15.81]That's crazy.
[30:16.75]I believe that.
[30:17.45]I actually do believe that.
[30:18.99]What's your number one soda?
[30:21.65]That you go to and it's like, nothing hits the same.
[30:24.15]Diet Coke.
[30:25.11]Diet Coke.
[30:25.53]Okay, number one.
[30:29.64]Honestly, a good... Tea or orange juice?
[30:32.60]A good Sprite out of the bar gun.
[30:35.80]It has to be from the bar gun.
[30:38.18]Sprite from the bar gun.
[30:39.42]Like directly into your mouth?
[30:41.58]No, you know that little, like, soda gun that they got?
[30:44.44]Yeah.
[30:45.12]Yeah.
[30:47.46]Dude, cream soda when I was a kid was my favorite.
[30:50.56]Easily.
[30:51.00]Easily.
[30:52.00]Actually, you know what?
[30:53.90]In the glass root beer.
[30:56.74]Yes.
[30:57.58]That's, yeah.
[31:00.05]Yeah.
[31:00.85]Good.
[31:01.09]I haven't had soda.
[31:01.87]I don't drink a lot of soda, but there's time and place.
[31:05.87]And, like, with onion rings and, like, a burger, like, at a diner.
[31:09.86]a root beer is fucking awesome dude oh my god it's time to go off on a restaurant and talk about it you just you just had a massive thing hit me there buddy have you guys ever had the red robin onion rings

[31:27.86]Those are the best onion rings I've ever had in my fucking entire life.
[31:32.67]In my entire life.
[31:34.59]It's like, why are they so good?
[31:36.85]They are the crunchiest.
[31:38.73]It's like, this is going to sound bad, but Holly was a big fan of them.
[31:42.73]She's like, you never had them before?
[31:43.63]I'm like, no.
[31:44.23]So we went.
[31:45.47]It's like chewing on gravel.
[31:47.38]It's so crunchy.
[31:48.44]And the onions, it just hits you in the face.
[31:50.86]It's so good.
[31:51.86]It's actually the best.
[31:55.08]They should use that in their ad campaigns.
[31:57.66]I'm so glad you said that.

[39:28.57]If you clean up, you make money?
[39:29.57]I made two...
[39:31.48]See, this is a better way.
[39:32.98]We don't have to do drugs.
[39:33.96]We just clean up the environment in the neighborhood.
[39:36.26]True.
[39:37.70]How many points do you get for that?
[39:42.44]Like drug points?
[39:43.34]What do you mean points?
[39:46.58]I should collect all the money so it's in one central location so we don't get confused by it.
[39:51.32]So I should take all the money and then I can pay out.
[39:56.73]I'm watching the sauce whiteboard.
[39:59.83]Yeah, I need to see that.
[40:01.21]Does it look like a blood stain at the top?
[40:03.55]I don't know, dude.

[48:32.62]Looks like you're going to need somewhere low-key to stay for a while.
[48:35.56]Head over to the motel and ask about getting a room.
[48:39.24]After that, you'll be needing some new equipment.
[48:41.22]There's a hardware store just northeast of motel.
[48:44.08]Grab a grow tent, soil, and watering can.
[48:47.17]Don't fuck it up.

[56:11.26]There's got to be a new record on twitch.tv.
[56:12.70]TV.
[56:12.88]What is that like?
[56:21.07]We're all waiting.
[56:22.94]I got- This is a crazy run.
[56:24.70]He thinks he's more important.
[56:27.70]If- Okay, if I- If you walked- If I walked up to you while you were playing, like, Donkey Kong, and you were on, like, screen eight, fuck you.
[56:33.24]Thanks a lot.
[56:33.62]Appreciate it.
[56:35.34]Yeah, go to- Let's sleep.
[56:36.88]Alright, time for bed.
[56:39.03]Flashlight's off.
[56:40.65]Flashlight off.
[56:41.69]Flashlight off.
[56:43.23]Jerma.
[56:43.87]Jerma.
[56:44.51]I can only sleep with the flashlight on.
[56:46.63]No nightlight.
[56:47.91]It's off.
[56:50.14]Toddler?
[56:50.68]Ster, you can't sleep with any lights on?
[56:52.20]I feel like you're that kind of guy.
[56:55.31]No, I can.
[56:57.67]I mean, it depends.
[56:58.23]What about TV?
[56:59.19]Like, sound?
[57:01.38]Uh, I mean if it's like white noise, I mean that helps.
[57:04.83]What about like it's Twitch stream?
[57:06.27]I feel like you're judging me and I don't know about what.
[57:08.39]I'm that kind of guy that needs quiet and dark to sleep?
[57:11.71]Like humankind?
[57:13.43]Like the species?
[57:14.67]If we ever had to go to a hotel together, I know what I can't do with you.
[57:19.55]Guys, I got an ad break coming up in a few minutes.
[57:22.55]Do you guys care if I take a quick break?
[57:25.22]We're just gonna keep having our streams live.
[57:28.96]I mean, I could just run around and cycle.
[57:31.76]If you have a dad, I'll be live.
[57:33.83]Yeah.
[57:34.63]No, I'm just gonna keep playing the game.
[57:37.03]Actually, I didn't get to pee, and that's not even a joke.
[57:40.35]Okay, go snake it up.
[57:42.27]No, not yet.
[57:43.99]While you're snaking, let's talk about Red Robin.
[57:47.15]No, that's my favorite place.
[57:48.35]Red Robin!
[57:49.59]Yeah, guys, he's gonna go drink some tea.
[57:50.93]This has to be when I'm not on break.
[57:52.95]No, I love that place.
[57:54.41]Dude, the Tavern Burger, yum.
[57:59.93]It's not a disease, Red Robin.
[58:02.93]No, I will fight to the death to fight against Red Robin.
[58:06.61]If somebody calls Red Robin a bad restaurant establishment, I will.
[58:09.83]I never had it.
[58:10.98]It's a completely acceptable place with acceptable burgers, but the onion rings and the sauce are very, very good.
[58:17.66]That's my opinion.
[58:19.82]Wait, Red Robin isn't an ice cream place?
[58:24.38]Look at this guy.
[58:25.82]Baskin Robins?
[58:27.90]There's only one Robin for me.
[58:31.76]That's Baskin Robbins, dawg.
[58:33.60]That's what I said.
[58:34.78]Who's Baskin?
[58:35.60]Alright, can I, can I, can you guys carry me or something?
[58:39.40]No.
[58:40.68]Baskin was his last name, probably.
[58:42.78]Oh, yeah, that checks.
[58:44.66]Do you can't, I don't think that's going to work in there.
[58:48.30]Wait, so his name is Rabin, Robbin.
[58:51.14]Rabin, Rabin Robbin.
[58:53.00]Rabin, Robbin.
[58:59.03]Alright, I'm gonna go pee.
[58:59.71]I'll be back in two minutes.
[59:00.55]Let's go to the hardware store.
[59:02.10]You guys can go do your thing.
[59:03.58]We're gonna be all doing drugs later anyway.
[59:05.76]Yeah, we got plenty of stuff that we can do later.
[59:07.44]I'll be right back.
[59:27.96]Yeah, I'll be back in two.
[59:28.70]I really do.
[59:29.35]I want to get another drink.
[59:30.27]I didn't get to move.
[59:33.59]Three minutes.
[59:34.13]BRB.
[59:35.25]See you soon.
[59:38.16]They're just playing basketball anyways.
[59:39.48]Don't worry.
[59:39.78]Be right back.
[62:33.35]I'm back getting my drink.
[62:34.61]I peed.
[62:36.09]Good.
[62:36.37]How they doing?
[62:48.96]Perfect timing.
[62:57.21]Yeah, so we just play with and just assume he's not coming back.
[63:00.45]Is he?
[63:00.67]Is he really drinking tea?
[63:01.91]I'm back.
[63:02.19]Does he really drink tea?
[63:04.59]I love tea, yeah.
[63:08.78]Yeah.
[63:09.38]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, come here and... We figured out, like, okay, so we need to get, uh, if we go to the hardware store and then we... We were looking up, but, uh, we go to the hardware store and then... What?
[63:22.75]What happened?
[63:30.31]Then when we go back, basically, that's what we do, yeah.
[63:33.97]That's not fucking funny.
[63:35.13]That's not funny!
[63:36.23]That's not funny.
[63:36.79]Don't do that to people.
[63:37.81]You understand?
[63:38.21]Don't do that to somebody.
[63:39.72]Don't fucking do that to somebody.
[63:40.84]I like how Ster didn't even do it, and he's the one hitting him.
[63:45.66]I know!
[63:45.92]I don't wanna watch.
[63:46.52]It would've been better if the second was.
[63:48.40]Hey, hey, you know what?
[63:49.54]Why don't we get a fucking bush light going here?
[63:53.01]He just sits down to game, grabs a bunch of beers, and if something goes wrong, he starts hitting me.
[63:59.39]I don't know what I did.
[64:01.78]Go to the hardware store.
[64:02.66]Alright, let's go.
[64:06.57]Okay, but Jerma, you should watch this, though.
[64:09.89]Okay.
[64:12.09]Wait, that's not you.
[64:12.67]Wait, where are you?
[64:14.85]Wait, why?
[64:15.47]Don't worry about it.
[64:16.11]It's fine.
[64:16.55]No, no, no.
[64:16.89]Oh, I was right there.
[64:18.26]Ride or die.
[64:18.88]Ride or die.
[64:19.40]She was going to call the cops.
[64:20.28]Thank you.
[64:20.60]Stop hurting people.
[64:23.66]Oh, yeah.
[64:24.24]For sure.
[64:33.48]Okay, hardware store.
[64:34.46]Can we play the game?
[64:36.20]Like, I've... We need to sell drugs to people.
[64:39.54]We're like throwing basketballs at each other.
[64:41.28]It's bad when you're saying that.
[64:44.31]Yeah, let's do it, Jerma.
[64:47.15]Shrek shack, let's go.
[64:49.09]Let's sell drugs.
[64:51.13]This is not where we need to be.
[64:52.11]Why are you guys stopping?
[64:54.97]Oh, yeah.
[64:55.77]How did you have enough money to get a skateboard?
[64:57.99]Because I won $200 in the casino.
[65:00.63]What?
[65:01.71]That's kind of dog shit.
[65:03.53]The golden one is so good.
[65:04.75]The golden one.
[65:08.31]That's so cool.
[65:08.93]Yeah, well, you're going to have to sell some drugs if you want one.
[65:12.64]You're going to have to play the game.
[65:14.92]Get out of here.
[65:16.58]I like this graffito over here.
[65:17.94]You're going to crash.

[66:52.46]Wait, did you see that, Vinny?
[66:54.21]They added, uh... Uh, Voices of the Void, uh... Neon Light in Voices of the Void.
[67:00.97]Voices of the Void?
[67:02.47]What did I say?
[67:05.05]They added your mushroom in Voices of the Void.
[67:06.63]Sorry, I had a brain fart.
[67:09.38]Mind sickness.
[67:10.80]So, mind sickness returns.
[67:12.58]Um... I'm aware that their, um... Voices of the Void is actually kind of started because of Joel.
[67:20.85]and to a degree, if I'm not mistaken.
[67:23.01]There's some history, but yeah, I saw that.
[67:25.78]It's kind of cool.
[67:27.06]The signal simulator game, right?
[67:29.36]Yeah, it started Joel playing signal simulator, and then Voice of the Void kind of came from that.
[67:35.20]So there's a couple of Vinesauce things in there, if I'm not mistaken, but it's neat.
[67:38.87]That's really cool, actually.
[67:39.85]One of the greatest games ever, I'll tell you what.
[67:44.45]Wow.
[67:46.51]Jeremy, was that you?
[67:47.77]No, it's the one that is...
[67:51.19]The one that wants to play the video game, not sell the drugs.
[67:55.20]What?
[67:55.72]Who?
[67:56.40]What happened?
[67:57.98]That was Ster.
[67:58.70]That was Ster.
[67:59.20]I know who- I know- No!
[68:05.98]Give me that fucking skateboard.
[68:08.32]No, that's my skateboard!
[68:11.24]I'm gonna- I'm gonna prove you all wrong.
[68:12.92]I'm gonna sell the biggest weed.
[68:16.21]Oh yeah?
[68:16.61]You wanna do a little weed competition?
[68:19.67]Yeah.
[68:23.63]So if you hold V and you attack, you can punch yourself in the face.
[68:28.81]What?
[68:30.09]Ow!
[68:30.89]You were not lying!
[68:31.78]Yeah.
[68:35.24]Now tell them you haven't played Voices of the Void yet.
[68:38.00]I haven't.
[68:39.98]I haven't.
[68:41.76]I have not played Voices of the Void.
[68:42.84]You should.
[68:43.86]I was told by one of the devs to wait a little while.
[68:47.75]Wow, that's messed up when the devs tell you don't play our game.
[68:50.17]That is smart, though.
[68:51.02]They know me too well.
[68:51.98]They know me too well.
[68:52.82]They know where I have my McFuckin' limits, so they probably are just waiting to implement some more stuff.
[68:58.12]More stuff.
[69:00.32]Okay, well, when the devs tell you to play, tell me that they told you to play.
[69:04.59]I will.
[69:05.33]I will.
[69:07.83]How do we get in this house?

[69:52.06]I got the soil.
[69:52.79]I tried to go home.
[69:54.23]The compass led me to a wrong direction.
[69:57.39]Yeah, I was going to where the star is.
[69:59.07]I think I don't belong here.
[70:00.85]Yeah, I did the same thing.
[70:01.79]We gotta go back to the motel.
[70:06.56]Do we?
[70:07.60]Cops are about to be everywhere, man.
[70:09.98]Music is pretty good.
[70:15.00]It's not continuous, though.
[70:16.00]I wish it was... Hey, when games don't... Like, they're just dead air for so long.
[70:20.56]Mm-hmm.
[70:22.44]Should be an option.
[70:23.92]Yeah, that would be a good thing to turn on.
[70:26.98]Continuous music.
[70:28.50]Oh, wrong person.
[70:31.89]She gave you such a look.
[70:33.71]Oh, it's this one here.
[70:34.35]This is our nice little house.

[71:43.50]Oh, shit.
[71:44.02]Okay.
[71:47.58]Ster, that is actually kind of amazing what you're doing right now.
[71:52.54]Want to get in on this?
[71:53.64]Poke, did you steal that person's car?
[71:56.27]No, if you press control, you could pickpocket them.
[71:59.53]No, no, not like that!
[72:01.17]Oh, sorry.
[72:04.35]Wait, where's the phone?
[72:06.05]Uh, payphone?

[72:14.06]I'm the worst reader ever.
[72:15.66]Like a hotel room that Gordon Ramsay would investigate with a blacklight.
[72:20.06]And be very disappointed.
[72:20.82]You're almost ready to go.
[72:22.08]I'm almost ready to go.
[72:23.60]I'm missing one key.
[72:24.34]Weed seeds.
[72:25.86]We've been microwaving our weed.
[72:27.39]Speak to the supplier to get hands on some seeds.
[72:30.09]We pass number on to Albert Hoover.
[72:31.85]Local weed seed supplier should be on your phone now.
[72:34.11]Send him a message and request a dead drop.
[72:35.85]A voucher for you so you won't have to pay up front.
[72:38.51]Your order will go on your tab.
[72:39.85]But you can pay off in the future.
[72:42.15]Okay.
[72:43.93]So we need to order seeds.
[72:54.84]So we have to announce when we harvest our seed.
[72:57.05]When we harvest the first weed plant.
[72:59.47]Don't... Do not.
[73:00.85]Just don't give it to me and I won't say anything.
[73:02.69]Just don't say these kinds of things.
[73:04.31]And then you won't have to worry about it.
[73:06.68]Albert Hoover.
[73:08.08]Send message if you'd like to order some Nelsons.

[75:24.72]Where's Ster?
[75:25.92]Is Ster here?
[75:27.44]Hi, I was just going on a money run.
[75:33.76]And I don't know how to get money.
[75:36.65]We get money by doing- what do you think we're doing in here?
[75:38.67]Are you participating?
[75:39.21]I don't know.
[75:39.57]I thought maybe I could rob a store or beat someone up or... I don't know.
[75:42.90]I thought there was maybe more.
[75:43.98]I don't know.
[75:45.96]We need to get- So we gotta buy some stuff.
[75:48.92]I say we sleep for tomorrow so we can buy a packaging station.
[75:51.76]That sounds good.
[75:54.84]Now, we're not all sleeping in the same bed, right?
[75:56.99]Like, one of us is on the floor, one's in the sink.
[75:59.71]We're taking turns.
[76:00.39]Okay.
[76:02.46]Um, I feel like in this situation, Jerma would not let us sleep on the bed.
[76:06.62]What do you mean?
[76:09.82]Oh, I need to sleep on the bed.
[76:11.28]Oh, I need it, guys, it hurts.
[76:14.02]And then you would force us to, like, sleep on these cabinet... shelves.
[76:19.19]I would be, I would be also, like, I would fight for that bed.
[76:22.55]I would actually fight for it, yeah.
[76:26.03]Yeah, I, uh, I...
[76:29.48]I could take it.
[76:30.10]I could take it.
[76:30.74]I could take it.
[76:31.22]Is this your argument?
[76:31.98]Your counter argument?
[76:32.94]Yeah.
[76:33.32]Yeah.
[76:33.82]Okay.
[76:34.04]Well, no, no, no.
[76:34.60]Hold on.
[76:35.08]I could take an inflatable, right?
[76:36.72]If you have like an inflatable mattress, I'm good.
[76:39.12]But I'm not sleeping.
[76:39.68]I can't sleep on the floor.
[76:40.76]I can't.
[76:42.81]I would sleep inside the hydro bro with the plant.
[76:47.49]I don't give a shit.
[76:50.35]Harvest the wheat.
[76:50.95]Is the wheat plant harvest?
[76:51.89]Is it ready?
[76:52.79]We need trimmers.
[76:54.27]Oh, shit.
[76:54.87]Okay.
[76:55.86]Alright, trimmers.
[76:56.36]I got them.
[76:58.29]Yeah, I took them from our old RV.
[76:59.65]Alright, let's get this together.
[77:00.83]Let's do this.
[77:03.09]Down on one knee.
[77:03.75]Come on.
[77:05.39]Get out of the way.
[77:06.03]There we go.
[77:08.55]Ooh, now we smoke it.
[77:10.75]Not yet.
[77:12.93]Wait, are you guys smoking the weed?
[77:14.32]Let's smoke it.
[77:16.66]I'm buying a package for us.
[77:17.66]Hold on.
[77:23.10]There's a leaf of weed outside that you ran over.
[77:26.02]I don't think that was a weed leaf.
[77:27.22]That was regular leaf.
[77:29.21]Did I just lose us $100?
[77:30.51]I just threw a weed leaf away and $110 came out of our account.
[77:34.29]I bought it.
[77:35.47]That was really weird timing.
[77:36.85]Alright, here we go.
[77:42.32]Packaging station right there.
[77:43.54]I'm putting the bags in there.
[77:49.08]Who has the weed?
[77:51.17]Somebody has it on them.
[77:52.37]I have it.
[77:57.34]Hey bro, this is all seeds, what the fuck?
[78:03.28]Aw man, dude.
[78:06.30]That's why you don't buy shit in the back of a gas station.
[78:12.27]My friend actually took those seeds one time, and he tried to harvest them.
[78:16.93]Not knowing that, you know, if you're gonna like grow the weed, you need a lot of time and effort.
[78:24.30]A lot.
[78:26.05]So, yeah, I mean, it didn't, you know, nothing happened.
[78:30.07]We need to package at least three weed.
[78:34.53]Do you think this game made people dealers in real life?
[78:39.24]I mean, marijuana is recreationally legal in, like, 30 of the 50 states.
[78:45.70]I mean, Assassin's Creed made me go to Japan and deface a shrine, so it's possible.
[78:51.29]Sir, what are you, you're admitting to that?
[78:55.10]No.
[78:56.15]Exactly.
[78:57.09]Allegedly.
[78:59.55]Yeah, because... Yeah, allegedly, exactly.
[79:01.35]Because, you know... That's what the tubers do.
[79:05.53]You're not a tuber, are you?
[79:07.63]Nope.
[79:08.47]Not unless we're talking about taters.
[79:11.57]Should we give the nug to some random person here?
[79:15.34]Oh, I have the nugs.
[79:18.96]Let me package them.
[79:20.64]Poke, rather.
[79:21.14]Where's that packaging station?
[79:22.40]Oh, here we go.
[79:23.06]It's in the house.
[79:25.02]Let's see if any.
[79:26.10]Let's do it together.
[79:26.92]Take a look.
[79:29.56]I'll grade your technique.
[79:30.50]See if it's any good.
[79:32.90]Trying.
[79:35.10]Can you see this happen in real time or no?
[79:38.17]I can.
[79:38.45]No.
[79:39.67]They just disappear when you're done.
[79:44.31]Genius strategy I just did.
[79:48.37]Garbage picker.
[79:52.44]You got like a trash bag?
[79:53.16]Yeah, I'm picking up garbage.

[89:29.93]I don't think we have to drop items.
[89:31.05]We all need a water root.
[89:32.27]You gotta put it on a shelf and take it from a shelf.
[89:35.28]A water root.
[89:39.48]Containers can transfer items, I'm being told.
[89:42.16]Alright, so here I'll go water this stuff.
[89:45.34]God, now we have even less room to sleep.
[89:52.30]We'll take shifts.
[89:52.92]Should we take the trash out?
[90:02.26]Oh, we need bags.
[90:04.66]Beags?
[90:07.58]Garbage bags.
[90:08.80]I don't like knowing when we're going to get bombed.
[90:12.85]I wish they just wouldn't warn me.
[90:21.82]This dude's just playing Snake.
[90:23.60]Oh, are we trying to go to bed?
[90:24.76]Alright, open that door for me.
[90:28.14]Thanks.
[90:31.12]Sir, I have you at 200%.
[90:33.40]You're just so chill.
[90:35.04]I've just seen one of your neighbors just do that.
[90:37.48]I'm the same with Jerma.
[90:38.46]I have to turn him to 200% nowadays.
[90:41.90]What do I do?
[90:43.34]Watering can and trimmers are on the shelf now.
[90:46.10]Turn up your mic gain.
[90:46.98]Make it mean.
[90:48.26]It's very loud already.
[90:49.42]Wait, that's free money?
[90:50.93]Should I just yell?
[90:52.89]Should I be more aggressive of a personality?
[90:55.81]No.
[90:56.89]No.
[90:57.87]Be no one but yourself.
[91:00.31]It's the mic.
[91:03.07]Do you like a hardware game?
[91:07.71]We've been over this, man.
[91:09.23]What's your mic plugged into?
[91:11.85]My mic is plugged into a booster that is plugged into a mixer.
[91:15.83]And the mixer also has control over gain.
[91:18.93]I can turn it up.
[91:22.81]I don't know what you're saying.
[91:24.79]Isn't that a music thing?
[91:26.97]Yeah, it's for the Shure mic.
[91:29.39]I have something like that.
[91:30.43]I don't know what it is.
[91:31.17]Because my mic used to be even quieter.
[91:34.93]Should I just get a new mic?
[91:37.63]I just completely changed my whole life.
[91:41.52]know no I don't think Mike you have is good I think life was better when everyone had worse mics I agree exactly I try and turn Jerma up to 200 in in Discord and that's what it sounds like when I do it it doesn't actually get louder it just starts going like it's talking
[92:03.10]Can we do, like, a challenge?
[92:04.83]Who could find the worst mic for next time?
[92:08.92]Yeah.
[92:09.28]It has to be real.
[92:09.80]Oh, I got one, bro.
[92:14.17]Vinny wins.
[92:14.95]Vinny's going to win.
[92:15.97]Yeah, he has hacks, dude.
[92:17.55]He has hacks.
[92:18.19]No, no, it's got to be hardware.
[92:20.17]It's got to be something that... A real mic.
[92:22.59]The mic itself, yeah.
[92:24.33]Okay, so I bought a $10 microphone that's supposed to be for karaoke on your phone, and it doesn't work with my computer.
[92:31.45]But it is the cheapest fucking microphone I've ever seen in my life.
[92:35.38]Plug it in right now.
[92:36.88]I can't.
[92:37.34]It doesn't work.
[92:39.12]It doesn't work.
[92:41.29]I like, I'm gonna take this challenge seriously.
[92:43.65]Next time, I'm gonna try to get a really, really shitty mic.
[92:50.10]And it's a challenge the first person to turn it off loses.
[92:54.36]Yes.
[92:57.56]I used to, when I was younger, I used to record into a boombox with an earphone.
[93:02.66]Like the left earphone, because those would function as a mic if you could put it into the mic slot.
[93:09.32]Yeah, doesn't every mic...
[93:11.62]Wait, every headphone could be a mic?
[93:14.24]That's what happened when I was younger, yeah.
[93:16.22]Dude, you got to get one of those old earbuds that had the mic in the earbuds.

[102:09.94]Take a look at how much we have to save now, Ster.
[102:11.80]Alright, let's bag this shit up.
[102:13.54]I'm talking about the maximum amount, not the deducted amount.

[102:54.77]I'm making bank.
[102:58.99]Dude, no one in this town has money to buy weed.
[103:02.17]We have to give those circle people on the map free samples so they become customers.
[103:07.13]And we unlock more people on the tree.
[103:09.88]On the contacts tree.
[103:11.58]Cool.
[103:12.62]This is fun.
[103:15.32]And we can get a dealer that sells weed for us.

[104:13.40]It's on the shelf.
[104:14.16]Should we get the product to put on the weed to get more plants?
[104:20.94]Yeah, definitely.
[104:21.52]Alright, who else wanted weed?

[104:59.35]You sure?
[105:01.45]Yeah.
[105:03.47]Sorry.
[105:05.57]Sorry, there's no one in there.
[105:06.73]Can you close it?
[105:07.75]Or is it broken?
[105:11.07]Vinny broke it.
[105:12.55]What the hell is going on over there?
[105:13.71]What are you guys doing?
[105:15.41]Vinny is breaking the game.
[105:16.57]Vinny is trying to ruin the game.
[105:20.57]Dude, I tried to put a body in there.
[105:22.27]A person who was sleeping.
[105:24.81]Oh no, that doesn't look good.
[105:26.07]Whatever it is.
[105:31.62]Oh, how do you... How do you get rid of the trash?
[105:35.41]The bags.
[105:38.19]Oh, um, well, normally we need some OG.
[105:40.89]Ster, you're gonna steal this.
[105:43.59]Yeah.
[105:44.21]Alright, go for the pickpocket and grab it back.
[105:45.75]They don't have it.
[105:50.33]What?
[105:51.78]Maybe pickpocket is your game?
[105:53.88]I don't know.
[105:56.94]Man, well, that's alright.
[105:59.06]You already smoked it.
[105:59.88]I don't know.

[106:24.26]Peter.
[106:24.38]What do you do when they're just not there?
[106:25.52]On the circle.
[106:31.42]We got a big order coming in, guys.
[106:34.40]Geraldine Poon, that is my free sample person.
[106:38.39]You did this.
[106:39.87]This is great.
[106:41.11]I'm so good at this game.

[106:43.79]What does Geraldine Poon need?
[106:45.45]Hold on, guys.
[106:50.55]Did you try to negotiate and we lost the deal?
[106:53.83]Peter Fial fucks with us.
[106:55.86]That's awful.
[106:56.96]Delete the VOD.
[106:57.68]Quick.
[106:58.63]Just to use your bit.
[107:00.17]Delete the VOD.
[107:02.05]Wait, did I negotiate and then he got mad at us?
[107:05.47]Geraldine Poon has declined to buy weed from us.
[107:11.64]Alright, so game's over.
[107:13.08]Try again tomorrow.
[107:15.04]Oh, I was trying to make a deal.
[107:16.83]I was wheeling and dealing.
[107:18.17]Yeah.
[107:18.89]Game's over, I guess.
[107:19.81]She didn't want anything to do with that shit.
[107:21.77]Eight, she wanted eight kush for $370, and I said, no, you don't want, you don't, fuck that.
[107:26.97]$500, even.
[107:28.92]You know what they said?
[107:29.70]They said the Poon name used to mean something in this town.
[107:34.30]So, they didn't want to have anything to do with us.
[107:39.06]Whatever, we don't need them anyways.
[107:40.71]We'll put our high quality product to where it belongs, other customers.
[107:48.13]There's a propane.

[108:09.96]We gotta pay the debt.
[108:12.20]Can someone pay the weed debt?
[108:14.16]We have a weed debt?
[108:16.34]Yes, we have a debt with Albert Hoover.
[108:20.84]So if someone go... I didn't take it.
[108:22.86]I'll go pay it.
[108:23.80]Just kill him.
[108:27.59]Cops are at our house.
[108:29.59]Wait, the cops are at the house?

[110:41.48]Do you have it?
[110:42.74]No, I mean, we do.
[110:44.34]Together, all of us do.
[110:45.50]I have $7.
[110:46.14]Okay, I'll come pay cash.
[110:48.46]I got money.
[110:48.88]That's how we order the weed.
[110:50.89]I'm depositing money right now.
[110:53.69]Go make both deals.
[110:55.03]Don't do it before I'm depositing money.
[110:56.67]No, wait, no, I'm depositing.
[110:57.83]No, I'm depositing.
[110:59.03]Poke's got it.
[110:59.55]I'm going to do this weed deals.
[111:01.73]I got a couple of deals here.
[111:02.77]This game is fun.
[111:10.45]Okay, Jerma sold some weed deal.
[111:12.11]That's good.
[111:14.15]I'll sell the next weed deal.
[111:16.45]Ask the crew if they saw the Minecraft movie.
[111:18.59]Dude, I got it all back.
[111:20.23]Not yet.
[111:21.58]I would like to.
[111:22.24]I hear there's a lot of references that only I would get as a Minecraft kid.
[111:31.18]Are you really like a Minecraft kid?
[111:34.00]I mean, I played it.
[111:35.46]I wasn't a kid when it came out.
[111:38.61]Yeah, I was an adult-ass man when it came out, and I
[111:42.40]I got a good chunk of the references.
[111:47.06]Is there redstone in it?
[111:49.40]Oh, not only is there redstone, Jack Black is like, redstone!
[111:52.08]This makes electricity!
[111:56.81]Yeah.
[111:58.09]Does he say the name of everything that comes on the screen that you would know the name of?
[112:02.97]And he does it in an over-the-top way every time.
[112:06.93]Just about every time.
[112:10.15]Are they gonna mod in his voice lines into Minecraft when you talk to Steve?
[112:15.19]Wouldn't be surprised.
[112:19.49]So, I wonder if it was any good.
[112:22.03]I heard it is terrible, but whatever.
[112:26.54]I'm gonna do a review after this.
[112:28.70]Okay, you guys are always- I'm saving it.
[112:30.40]You guys are negative.
[112:31.78]Negative Nancys.
[112:33.10]We're gonna have a Minecraft on-stream review.
[112:38.05]I'm not going to do it with you guys because it'll distract me, no offense.
[112:40.81]I feel like I don't want to bore you or waste your time, so I'm just going to do it on my stream.
[112:45.55]You're just going to do it to a thousand other people.
[112:49.53]No, understandable, understandable.
[112:50.97]Nothing else.
[112:54.67]But it is actually, like, the amount of times, I'll say this as kind of a preview, the amount of times I laughed when I don't think I was supposed to laugh was very high.
[113:06.87]so yeah I think it's it's in entertaining in a way that maybe wasn't planned and as such it's probably worth I mean you've seen the room it's not that kind of thing but it's close wow okay interesting yeah not quite but yeah just a couple chuckles here and there the room have you seen the room poke no yeah but like the same vibes
[113:32.22]Uh, it's- it's not quite- That's a pretty bold claim.
[113:34.82]It's not quite- but it's just unintentionally funny.
[113:38.24]In a lot of spots.
[113:39.18]And then it is intentionally funny, and- and some of it was also kind of in- it- you know what?
[113:44.62]Oh.
[113:46.24]I'm spoiling the review, fellas.
[113:47.89]What is paracetamol?
[113:50.33]I can't believe our trash machine is broke, Vinny.
[113:53.43]What the fuck, man?
[113:55.23]No, it works from- it worked again, it worked.
[113:56.97]It's working, it's working.
[113:58.29]Is it?
[113:59.21]Yeah.
[114:00.59]Oh.
[114:02.25]You're allowed to say it was enjoyable.
[114:05.60]No, you're not.
[114:06.10]I mean, if you enjoy it on any level, that's enjoyable.
[114:09.40]So, yeah, I agree with that.
[114:10.57]Sure.
[114:13.11]Like I said the other day, your little brother is going to cheer when he sees the fucking diamond sword.
[114:20.61]Who cares?
[114:22.27]Yeah, exactly.
[114:23.57]It's that kind of thing.
[114:24.91]I do.
[114:26.09]Diamond armor.
[114:27.73]Full set.
[114:30.17]Wait, is that actually in the movie?
[114:32.21]Yes.
[114:34.29]That's his acting throughout most of the movie.
[114:37.29]He just oversells every line.
[114:39.83]It's really actually kind of astounding.
[114:43.99]diamond arm are you going to bed and does sometimes Vinny does he go come on does he do like that too yeah yes he does come on hey you sound like eddie better yes yes he does a lot of that we going to bed mm-hmm I saw there was a noise in Jerma
[115:10.84]I'm going to bed.
[115:12.49]I know.
[115:13.01]I know.
[115:13.41]I just see we're running away.
[115:14.35]I was worried.
[115:16.83]These plants need some water.
[115:21.29]Thirsty little plants.
[115:29.68]We got $1,120.
[115:29.90]We need baggies.
[115:30.62]I'll go get them.
[115:31.26]How many do we need?
[115:34.70]A lot.
[115:34.86]Okay.
[115:36.04]You get them from the hardware store?
[115:39.80]Yeah.
[115:40.64]I'm on it.
[115:41.70]And we need another, uh, storage.
[115:45.45]Oh, we, we're about to, wait, wait, wait.
[115:47.27]We should buy the place.
[115:48.37]We should buy the place above the Chinese shop.
[115:51.01]Let's do that.
[115:56.16]I'm going to buy, should I buy like a hundred?
[116:01.22]What are you buying?
[116:02.46]Baggies.
[116:04.32]Oh yeah.
[116:04.70]Baggies.
[116:05.12]I think a hundred is good.
[116:06.04]Maybe like buy 40 and then buy a large storage rack.
[116:10.26]And let's move all of our stuff into a new base.
[116:12.94]Uh, what about a TV?
[116:15.62]We already have one.
[116:17.04]I mashed space when I pickpocket.
[116:21.14]Alright, large cabinet, 40 baggies, uh, anything else?
[116:24.17]I put my mouse on the arrow.
[116:27.25]Me too.
[116:28.57]Really?
[116:29.41]Yeah.
[116:31.11]After a few, I adopted the strat.
[116:35.15]Alright, I got a bunch of shit.
[116:37.56]We're the same.
[116:40.15]Same brain.
[116:41.17]Tech brain.
[116:43.01]I think somebody's mad at us.
[116:45.99]Yeah, okay.
[116:47.39]Somebody said that they don't want to buy from us anymore?
[116:50.69]Scoff.
[116:55.27]You have the bags?
[116:56.39]I do.
[116:56.59]Yeah, and I bought a floor lamp for us.
[116:59.07]We really need to... Really?
[117:02.07]No, Jerma, hold on.
[117:03.65]How are we going to move anywhere?
[117:05.17]Oh, I thought we could... Oh, right, hold on.
[117:07.39]We need 800 cash.
[117:09.45]How do we move it?
[117:12.03]Can you get it from the ATM?
[117:13.93]Vinny?
[117:15.39]Yeah?
[117:17.14]Watch out for the ceiling fan.
[117:18.58]Ster, you got this?
[117:20.32]Oh yeah, buddy.
[117:22.18]I knew you could handle a task such as this.
[117:27.10]Alright, let's grab everything.
[117:29.38]Oh, grab everything, okay.
[117:30.82]I think we're moving.
[117:32.32]Oh, alright.
[117:32.74]We're moving.
[117:33.57]We're moving.
[117:36.35]Shmoovement.
[117:37.24]So it doesn't just do a cutscene, we actually have to physically move everything.
[117:41.32]Uh, she gave me a 50% discount.
[117:45.75]Why?
[117:46.01]Uh, cute.
[117:47.33]I'm cute.
[117:48.07]She said I'm cute.
[117:49.51]Give her a free sample.
[117:50.43]So we're back here?
[117:53.67]This is our home.
[117:55.63]Whoa.
[117:56.03]Behind here.
[117:58.15]Moving up in the world.
[117:59.89]Literally, second floor.
[118:01.95]Oh damn, this is up on the stu- Whoa, this is swanky!
[118:10.34]Drug den.
[118:11.52]Second floor.
[118:15.90]Plant trimmers.
[118:19.03]PGR.
[118:25.53]Steel pickaxe.
[118:29.19]I want to see this really bad now actually you sold me yeah I just I didn't want to like go through and count how many times he named something it's a lot it's actually a lot I feel like you're driving down the the highway like a long road trip you just oh oh there's blue car blue car you got a point steel pickaxe I feel like that's that it's not perfect though yeah that sounds like a great one everything you'd want from like a movie based off your game
[118:56.83]to a large degree yes but what's weird about it is I'll say this I'll give you guys a little something you ever seen napoleon dynamite oh yeah yes same director what okay that's weird so it actually functions as like a napoleon dynamite type movie for like a a decent amount of its run time interesting
[119:19.72]It's a very, very strange film.
[119:22.42]So.
[119:23.74]I'm running up on an ad break.
[119:26.12]I'm going to just kind of look at the wall.
[119:29.80]Now we're just moving shit around.
[119:33.35]I want to get up, but it's all good.
[119:35.33]I don't think we're doing very much for the next minute or two.
[119:39.25]Just go stare at a vending machine now.
[119:40.75]They're going to hit in a minute here, so just to let you know.
[119:44.20]I wouldn't know, Poke.
[119:46.73]I wouldn't know.
[119:47.69]So some would say I didn't actually see the film.
[119:51.61]I heard you could see it with no effects.
[119:54.01]I did.
[119:54.29]Is that how you watched it?
[119:56.41]Oh, I gotta give you the bags.
[119:57.83]I gotta give you the bags.
[120:01.16]Have we been getting lied to for like 20 minutes?
[120:03.64]Okay, so would someone argue that you watched it the wrong way?
[120:07.49]I watched it the wrong way because I didn't see it in a theater full of screaming children punching each other, vomiting, puking.
[120:12.37]I'm grabbing a drink.
[120:13.41]It's the same thing, but yeah.
[120:14.91]I will be back in a minute.
[120:17.25]Okay, Jerma.
[120:25.83]You guys want me to keep them on the screen while I beer beer?
[120:31.44]Yeah, why not?
[120:33.72]engaging part of the film well you know what we'll talk about that when I do my review mark mothersbaugh did the soundtrack for some reason yeah it's crazy because like it's just there's Jack black singing like three or four separate songs and I'm like man the guy from devo wrote this
[121:04.56]What's going on here?
[121:06.20]What's happening, sir?

[121:46.17]Watch this.
[121:46.51]Ready?
[121:46.93]First try.
[121:50.34]Damn it.
[121:50.60]I'm watching you.
[121:56.86]You can't see the physics.
[121:58.26]When someone throws it, it just drops at their feet.
[122:01.50]Oh, I saw that one.
[122:05.54]Okay.
[122:14.67]This is too hard.
[122:15.47]Yeah, it's not real.
[122:19.11]Only way I would do this is if you paid me millions of dollars.
[122:25.18]Otherwise, I'm out.
[122:25.90]Frick.
[122:29.20]I got you.

[123:09.88]Drugless, it's me, your pal, Mr. Dink.
[123:12.85]If I run into him, I don't know.
[123:15.23]Is that how you get friendly with people?
[123:16.47]Do you give them drugs?
[123:17.89]I've invented a new form of weed, Drugleth.

[125:44.62]Um... Bro.
[125:48.41]Beater.

[125:52.18]Beater.
[125:53.26]Come down to the office, sir.
[125:55.30]I can't even tell the difference between you and the other characters.
[125:58.72]I don't know where you and Family Guy end.
[126:02.92]Come on down to the office, beater.
[126:05.99]Now, you know what I want to hear from you, sir?
[126:08.19]I want to hear a Stewie.
[126:12.09]I couldn't.
[126:13.17]Yes, you couldn't.
[126:13.73]I really need, like...
[126:18.51]I don't know, like... Everyone gets an assignment of, uh... They need to come back next week or next time we game.
[126:29.33]One impression.
[126:30.59]Like, maybe I can come back with a Stewie.
[126:32.27]I don't think I can just, like, make a Stewie.
[126:34.26]You gotta practice it in the mirror?
[126:35.70]Which is better on the spot.
[126:37.74]I'm sorry to tell you this, but I do a very good Stewie.
[126:40.46]Ster.
[126:40.88]Okay, well, give me an example.
[126:43.18]Ugh.
[126:44.52]That's it?
[126:45.64]Ugh.
[126:46.42]Ugh.
[126:47.69]That was good.
[126:48.19]Actually, I feel that.
[126:52.67]Brian, we have to go.
[126:58.78]Brian, how's that novel you've been working on?
[127:01.28]I see.
[127:03.18]Enemies that become friends.
[127:04.40]Friends become enemies.
[127:06.58]Et cetera, et cetera.
[127:08.02]That first part really hit Vinny.
[127:11.85]Do you know Arlo, the blue puppet?
[127:16.23]no do you is it a Nintendo puppet guy he likes to talks about Nintendo stuff he's arlo no never mind no okay I can do an impression of him but I can only do it of him saying ah that's it I can't do any like more that's it right there it's a very specific skill set that's why you need like a time to practice you can't just pull out a stewie especially a woman in front of a stewie expert
[127:45.54]I think that you could pull a Stewie out if you wanted to, Stu.
[127:48.49]You just have to try to... That's pretty good.
[127:51.49]Brian, pulling is out of nowhere.
[127:54.33]It's very easy.
[127:55.43]All you... Peter.
[127:58.59]That's right.
[127:59.17]All you have to do, Peter.
[128:00.39]That wasn't... People call me the Grinch?
[128:02.57]That wasn't the Grinch?
[128:06.20]Grinch.
[128:07.80]Who am I?
[128:08.10]Am I Brian?
[128:09.18]I don't know anymore.
[128:11.20]Who are you?
[128:12.12]What do I do with a donut?
[128:14.02]I can't do a Stewie.
[128:17.20]We don't live here anymore.
[128:17.98]You can try.
[128:19.54]I like that one.
[128:23.84]Guys, come to the casino.
[128:25.42]Yeah!
[128:27.44]Oh, shit.

[128:29.76]I haven't been able to find my way anywhere, so... Yeah, can you ping it so that it shows up in a giant light on the map?
[128:37.51]No, just on the map.
[128:39.05]You see me in the right side.
[128:40.83]Yeah, but can we get a ping?
[128:42.21]I'm to your east.
[128:43.77]Just open the fucking map.
[128:47.39]I can't.
[128:48.13]It's not fair.

[128:49.61]Yeah, but I'm talking to you.
[128:51.29]Well, I can't skateboard and be on my phone at the same time.
[128:54.09]Alright, it's this way.
[128:59.87]Why is this music so good?
[129:05.40]Who the hell?

[130:10.20]Easy, easy, easy.
[130:14.16]Statistically speaking, it's more likely to be inside.
[130:22.53]I say hearts.
[130:23.09]I was gonna take the money, but then Poke said we wouldn't be friends if I didn't waste my money together with him.
[130:37.94]Well, I love you for trying.
[130:40.26]Thank you, man.
[130:41.10]I appreciate you trying.
[130:44.96]I think Jerma's having a bad night.

[132:57.31]Dub.
[132:58.85]Dub.
[133:03.63]All our hard-earned money just... Where'd it go?
[133:08.53]Well, somebody told me to get rid of it.
[133:10.17]Somebody said go to the casino and we all flocked there like moths to a fucking lighter.
[133:14.92]It took me no time whatsoever to go to that casino.
[133:17.48]Yeah, it was moths to a flame.

[133:48.95]Yeah, like Chloe ball.
[133:50.59]That thing got in the way.
[133:58.63]I'm sorry, I'm starting to get it.
[134:00.07]It's just that we moved houses so quickly.
[134:05.40]Right, like you had so little time.
[134:10.64]Who else needs something?
[134:14.63]I've seen a lot of never minds by the way.

[140:54.03]No, no, no.
[140:54.69]Hold on.

[141:00.56]It doesn't change it for you.
[141:02.28]But I didn't hear Green Needle.
[141:04.08]Yeah, but just think about Green Needle right now.
[141:06.11]You're going to hear Green Needle.
[141:08.15]Now watch that same video.
[141:09.05]Just trust me on this.
[141:11.37]You're going to hear Green Needle.
[141:13.85]Think about Green Needle.
[141:16.05]Think about it.
[141:17.74]Think about Green Needle.
[141:19.34]Green Needle.
[141:20.60]Green Needle.
[141:21.94]Green Needle.
[141:23.96]Well, I can't hear it.
[141:24.90]I hear Jerma saying it.
[141:37.15]Yeah.
[141:38.53]It switches for you, right?
[141:41.05]I mean, if I listen for a G, you can hear a G. Okay, now have it say brainstorm.
[141:47.22]Okay.
[141:49.22]Brainstorm.
[141:50.62]Brainstorm.
[141:51.34]Do you hear brainstorm?
[141:56.96]I don't know how you're supposed to hear brainstorm.
[141:59.04]Give it some time.
[141:59.87]Just wait.
[142:01.09]You heard brain needle.
[142:02.35]You're halfway there.
[142:04.17]Whoa, we're halfway there.
[142:06.93]I'm halfway to unlocking the brainstorm part of my mind.
[142:11.46]Brainstorm.
[142:22.28]Brainstorm.
[142:22.62]That's not possible to hear brainstorm.
[142:24.26]There's like two syllables.
[142:27.46]Storm is one, and Needle is two.
[142:29.52]You ever get the one with the paper plates that are inside out, but then they flip right side up?
[142:37.94]What?
[142:38.60]I'll show you.
[142:40.12]I'll send it in the boys chat.
[142:42.34]Brainstorm.
[142:47.65]Brainstorm.
[142:48.05]The fact that you can't change it on the fly really bothers me.
[142:52.77]Yeah, it's almost like we overestimated him.
[142:56.28]I can hear the difference between the G and the Brie.
[142:58.70]What about Laurel and Yanny?
[143:02.52]Do you have any Laurel-Yanny opinions?
[143:05.05]Okay, well, okay.
[143:06.15]Every time I go back into the game, I'm told to leave.
[143:08.01]I'm going to go your Yanny.
[143:12.41]Laurel or Yanny.
[143:14.97]Yeah, I'm going to go your Nanny.
[143:18.26]That's right.
[143:19.68]Everybody take a look at this.
[143:26.80]Did you post it?
[143:28.13]I'll drop it over.
[143:29.17]These plates, they're going to be a certain way.
[143:32.17]They're divoted plates.
[143:34.19]I'll drop it in here.
[143:34.83]Hold on.
[143:38.07]This new Discord layout fucking blows.
[143:40.55]Oh, man.
[143:41.85]Take a look at those plates.
[143:43.07]They are going to flip and you are not going to be able to make them go back.
[143:47.53]They're divoted plates or are they?
[143:49.59]Are they upside down or are they right side up?
[143:55.54]Right.
[143:56.56]What?
[143:57.93]Are the plates upside down or are they face down or face up?
[144:02.83]I'm immune.
[144:03.83]I just hear Laurel.
[144:05.61]No, they're face up.
[144:07.61]No, they're face down.
[144:10.07]Alright, now blink a few times.
[144:12.09]You can make them go face down, all of them.
[144:15.46]Is the screamer going to pop up?
[144:18.86]No.
[144:19.04]It just flipped.
[144:19.98]They flipped for me.
[144:21.34]I flipped them.
[144:22.18]You guys told me to go do something.
[144:23.86]You just forgot about me.
[144:25.66]I flipped them.
[144:26.70]We just did a let's play hide and seek and I went and I did it.
[144:29.52]And I come back and you're like, no, we actually were over this now.
[144:34.62]No, but you did the green.
[144:37.25]What about the Yanni?
[144:37.91]Do you hear green?
[144:38.95]I just did it.
[144:39.61]All I heard was Laurel.
[144:41.17]You didn't hear green Laurel?
[144:43.35]I didn't hear green laurel and I kept trying to like hear yanny I know didn't hear it is that something that like only um lobsters can hear I'll I'll link you to yanni Spotify I got you gotcha what about the dress is it green or blue it's blue it's blue
[145:05.29]Yeah, I'm going to leave this up for a few minutes because people are telling me that I'm just making this up.
[145:08.77]And this is just a picture and I'm just trolling everybody.
[145:10.67]Yeah, it's not changing for me.
[145:11.49]It will.
[145:12.07]And when it does, you're going to freak out because they're going to pop open.
[145:15.15]I can't get them to go back the other way.
[145:16.52]They were right side up for me.
[145:17.96]I cannot get them to go right side up anymore.
[145:20.58]I couldn't get them to pop out.
[145:21.80]I couldn't.
[145:23.20]I tried.
[145:23.76]They're all upside down for me now.
[145:27.80]Oh, you guys moved on to it.
[145:29.34]I'm one step behind.
[145:31.14]Yeah, there's a new brain thing we're doing now.
[145:37.46]It's these- It's these marshmallows.
[145:40.01]Dude, we just- I love optical illusions.
[145:42.75]We just brought you to, like, a roller coaster and said, oh man, we got four tickets, let's fucking go, the drop is so crazy!
[145:48.53]And then we got up to the front of the line and the three of us left and you just rode the ride by yourself.
[145:54.50]We went to go get snow cones while you rode the ride.
[145:57.58]Yeah, you guys- I feel like you guys are giving me, like, riddles and then fucking off because, like, you don't want to watch me while mom's not here.
[146:07.87]By the time I'm done looking at these marshmallows, you're going to be on to the next one.
[146:13.31]What?
[146:15.29]Alright, do you want to know about the marshmallow water?
[146:16.99]Are we going to make some money selling drugs?
[146:18.88]If they're top down or up or down, up downsies.
[146:22.76]Are they upside down or right side up?
[146:25.78]They are.

[161:36.84]And do you understand?
[161:38.28]We make the weed into that mix and then the other mix into the other mix and we sell that better weed.

[163:01.06]Have you guys ever played Satisfactory?
[163:08.12]I've seen people play it.
[163:08.96]I played a little bit.
[163:10.23]It doesn't work with my brain.
[163:13.03]I said that was my game of the year last year.
[163:16.19]I know you're into it, Ster.
[163:18.55]Big fan.
[163:19.79]Love that game.
[163:24.73]Yeah, we should all boot up a Satisfactory co-op and then play Factorio together.
[163:29.63]That seems like something that everybody would enjoy.
[163:31.59]Oh, yeah.
[163:33.49]Like every single person here would enjoy that.
[163:36.49]That's going to be a no from me, unfortunately.
[163:38.49]You know, I think every person here would enjoy that.
[163:43.60]I think we would really bond as a group
[163:47.38]I like when numbers go up in different ways.
[163:50.35]Like, I do like number go up game, but it has to be like, I gotta hit something with a sword.
[163:55.19]It's weird.
[163:55.63]I agree.
[163:58.01]Honestly, I'm just too... Oh, so you'll go fight the monsters in Satisfactory.
[164:04.32]I get the turning the iron into the scraps and then turning the scraps into the sheet metal and turning the sheet metal into... But once you have like nine tiers, I kind of just can't anymore.
[164:11.86]I like in starting when you go to the mines.
[164:15.34]Yeah.
[164:16.78]Yeah, I like that.
[164:17.42]That is really fun too.
[164:19.06]Yeah.
[164:20.08]But then Monster Hunter came out.
[164:21.24]I'm like, I'm good.
[164:22.18]So what's wrong with me?
[164:23.16]Do I even like anything anymore?
[164:26.41]Are you still playing it?
[164:27.93]No.
[164:30.27]Busy.
[164:30.53]A lot of stuff has kind of come out though.
[164:33.23]Yeah.
[164:34.23]Yeah.
[164:38.50]The characters on their phone standing here in the game.
[164:41.24]And I feel like that's how you're also.
[164:43.36]That's me right now in real life.
[164:44.58]Yeah.
[164:45.86]We need 9 OG Kush to make a ton of money.
[164:49.52]Who's got that OG?
[164:50.72]I only got 2 on me and I'm doing a final deal here.
[164:53.34]This is at the skate park.
[164:56.80]There's a bunch of OG Kush in there.
[164:58.80]Can I get them sour diesel?
[165:01.24]Wait, we don't have that?
[165:02.82]We should take the sour diesel off the market and put the other thing.
[165:09.98]Shit, well they're expecting the Kush now.
[165:12.42]The person wants it.
[165:13.48]They gotta get let down.
[165:14.14]They're fucked.
[165:17.19]Yeah, just tell them we're done doing those drugs.
[165:22.60]Okay, I've got 1,000 USD coming into the bank right now.
[165:28.02]Please utilize it well.
[165:29.24]I'm the trash man.
[165:34.95]I'm just the trash man.
[165:36.55]I actually want it to be a clean 1,000.
[165:45.87]I love this game.
[165:47.15]This game is really fun.
[165:47.73]It's kind of fun just picking up trash.
[165:51.85]You can multitask.
[165:52.57]You'll be alright.
[165:53.13]Oh yeah, we got a lot of people that want drugs.

[166:26.45]Are we good with that?
[166:29.77]What if we just do it for free?
[166:31.09]Yeah.
[166:31.45]Out of like the kindness of our heart.
[166:34.03]We just make sure everyone is supplied.

[171:54.56]That's the best.
[171:55.38]Comin' home!
[171:55.84]Is what he said Benjamin Button is a coming-of-age movie?
[172:02.91]I guess it is!
[172:03.57]It's un-becoming-of-age.
[172:07.07]By the way, that movie is fucking stupid.
[172:09.41]Can we just, like, say that?
[172:11.33]I've never seen it.
[172:12.11]I've never seen it.
[172:12.91]That might be the dumbest movie of all time.
[172:17.41]That's what happens when a group of people smoke a bunch of weed and actually come up with a weed movie and then they make the weed movie.
[172:22.97]I don't know why they made it.
[172:25.01]That was also that Tusk movie from Kevin Smith about the man who becomes a fucking walrus or something.
[172:32.12]Oh yeah, that movie was weird.
[172:33.30]Oh, you're not allowed to talk about that.
[172:38.46]That gives Ashley nightmares.
[172:41.70]I haven't seen it.
[172:42.62]I have to see it.
[172:44.72]It's messed up.
[172:45.83]Did you like Tusk?
[172:46.51]Do you guys watch the movie The Monkey?
[172:49.79]The Monkey.
[172:51.25]It's a new one.
[172:52.67]What is it?
[172:54.27]It's like a... Horror?
[172:56.29]Kind of like a Final Destination type of deal.
[172:59.39]People dying.
[172:59.99]Oh yeah, gotcha.
[173:01.59]That's just life.
[173:02.67]Just life.
[173:03.94]I call that murder porn.
[173:07.40]Yeah.
[173:07.96]I'm not really into it that much.
[173:10.40]Like dying.
[173:12.24]Like death movie.
[173:14.14]Yeah, like dying porn.
[173:16.90]Sounds weird when I say that.
[173:18.04]Never mind.
[173:18.54]But yeah, it's weird in here.
[173:20.02]It's weird in here.
[173:20.54]Can we go to bed on that note?
[173:22.04]Alright.
[173:22.24]I want to do.
[173:23.12]I want to.
[173:23.62]I feel like I'm like a nine year old.
[173:25.16]I'm going to mix a Coca-Cola, a banana and a donut.
[173:27.64]And it's going to be the donut surprise.
[173:30.42]Like, what are we doing?
[173:31.50]How do I how do I do this?
[173:33.25]Here, there's weed in there so you can make a mix.
[173:35.49]So mix it with something first.
[173:37.27]OK, so it was like Homer Simpson donut.
[173:40.57]Put a donut in there.
[173:41.37]I already did the donut one.
[173:44.44]Oh, you did Donut already?
[173:45.18]What about Banana?
[173:45.80]I mean, you can do Donut.
[173:47.36]Again, they make more of my weed.
[173:49.08]Banana's unknown.
[173:50.84]Okay, I put Banana.
[173:53.55]And Weed.
[173:55.09]I start it.
[173:57.75]What about Weed and Coke?
[173:58.75]We can play a new game.
[174:01.73]I really, I'm like, I love this game.
[174:03.31]I mean, look at them.
[174:05.45]Are they not having fun?
[174:06.07]Are you guys not having fun?
[174:07.63]I don't think- I don't think Vinny Moody- Wait, wait, no, I sold several baggies of weed.
[174:13.53]I have a lot of money.
[174:14.37]Are there only two of us having fun?
[174:16.97]I'm having fun.
[174:17.63]I'm chilling.
[174:21.43]Yeah, let's- let's pop open, uh, Satisfactory.
[174:26.26]I mean... We could do, like, a full, uh, to Space Age.
[174:31.52]I mean... I'm down.
[174:34.78]I don't know, fellas.
[174:36.68]Getting kinda late.
[174:39.12]This one is... What happened?
[174:45.93]Rudy Puke?
[174:46.67]I'm sure I'm gonna go to bed.
[174:49.53]Rudy Puke is a great name.
[174:50.93]That sounds like a Garbage Pail Kid.
[174:52.23]That's really good.
[174:57.54]Everyone go to bed!
[174:58.68]VRJosh says, you guys should have a code word that only you guys know that you can deploy when someone isn't having fun.
[175:07.62]Oh, man.
[175:08.22]How does he know that we've been saying it this whole time?
[175:12.87]The word was, what, murder porn?
[175:17.33]That might be.
[175:20.81]I'm going to combine a banana and mouthwash.
[175:22.95]Yeah, do it.
[175:24.55]I'll let you know how it goes.
[175:25.48]I'm going to get the dead drop.
[175:37.25]Alright, what about like Viagra and bananas?
[175:43.96]Oh, you can't mix, um, bananas.
[175:46.66]You need like a drug.
[175:48.18]Oh.
[175:49.84]Try, throw banana at Viagra.
[175:52.80]Like you said, that's a good idea.
[175:57.16]I don't think I can do it.
[175:59.81]How about mouthwash and Viagra?
[176:03.09]I don't think you can do it.
[176:03.87]I think it has to be a drug drug.
[176:05.05]Shit.
[176:12.22]Mix donuts back to back?
[176:16.16]You need to mix weed with something?
[176:19.60]Oh wait, I can do... You can put like a... A donut and then do a donut again, sometimes that'll be good.
[176:23.85]Oh shit.
[176:24.43]What do we got?
[176:27.57]Yeah, this was banana and now it's donut.
[176:30.07]So we're kind of going down another road here.
[176:31.89]Okay, this is cool.
[176:37.95]Aspen death.
[176:38.87]This thing sells for 60 bucks.
[176:43.77]I guess that's the kind of neat, is you can just do all this weird stuff.
[176:50.54]Get some weird weeds.
[176:55.00]But I mean, when I was younger, people would be like, bro, you don't understand.
[176:57.74]I got the fucking, the good shit.
[177:00.78]I got the cookie puss.
[177:03.96]Trust me, you want the cookie puss.
[177:08.12]I don't think I'd... Okay.
[177:10.32]I mean, I could be talked into anything.
[177:13.60]And then, like, you try the cookie puss, and it just tastes like fucking dirt.
[177:18.72]What, sour diesel and mouthwash?
[177:23.95]You guys get on the cookie puss?
[177:26.53]Try some of that cookie puss.
[177:32.44]I'm noticing some of our money keeps vanishing.
[177:38.78]Is anyone at the casino?
[177:41.32]I'm standing, I'm right here.
[177:44.93]Somebody get us off the market.
[177:46.57]Somebody get us off the market right now.
[177:52.27]What do we need to take off?
[177:54.57]Whatever we're selling because we don't have it.
[177:57.37]We are currently selling sour diesel.
[178:01.83]We got green crack, granddaddy purple.
[178:05.00]There's a lot of weed there.
[178:08.26]Yeah, what is it?
[178:08.74]I think you can mix like 20 at a time if you right click.
[178:13.23]When you're doing the mixing, you can grab a lot with the right click.
[178:15.79]Oh, cool.
[178:18.05]Oh, we don't really have much weed, do we?
[178:22.15]This back shelf right here, there's 20... Oh, that needs to be packaged.
[178:25.59]Okay.
[178:27.20]So what do we want to make?
[178:28.14]I got 16 sour diesel.
[178:30.76]I'll go make some deals.
[178:31.98]We should just sell that, and then this new weed we're growing, this green crack, we should do some mixes with that.
[178:37.64]I'll make some deals.
[178:38.24]I'll go sell some weed.
[178:41.66]Green...
[178:44.31]Crack.
[178:44.59]Crack.
[178:45.27]Crack.
[178:48.51]What just happened?
[178:49.23]Did it, like, obliterate my stuff?
[178:51.45]Ice cream balls.
[178:52.35]I got ice cream balls.
[178:55.97]Really?
[178:57.27]You gotta see this.
[178:58.58]You gotta see it.
[179:00.50]The special effects of it.
[179:02.72]Smoke it.
[179:03.12]It does nothing to you.
[179:05.04]It causes balding.
[179:07.38]Oh, no.
[179:08.80]It says refreshing, sneaky, and balding.
[179:11.36]It's premium marijuana.
[179:12.77]Ice cream balls.
[179:15.17]Premium product?
[179:16.83]Can you make five weeds and just mix everything you can with each?
[179:21.53]Like, make, like, five, and then just make the most fucked up weed for us to smoke.
[179:26.94]Can you do that?
[179:29.06]Okay.
[179:30.98]Yeah.
[179:32.50]Well, you said the green crack is gonna be good for that, right?
[179:35.41]Yeah, but whatever you have right now, just get one of every mat you can and just mix that shit.
[179:39.39]So make five.
[179:41.09]You know what I'm saying?
[179:42.97]Okay.
[179:43.61]I'm getting some Stanky Dank.
[179:48.40]Oh, I played Stanky Dank at the Nintendo presentation.
[179:54.64]Oh, did you have a good time?
[179:56.30]Yeah.
[179:57.74]So you had like one by one or?
[180:00.60]I did.
[180:01.30]I played Mario Kart and Stanky Dank and I played Metroid, yeah.
[180:04.68]Huh?
[180:07.91]stinky pretty good pretty good alright yeah I was even on the news by accident in the background of people like is that Vinny I'm like no but it was yeah it's it was dude you keep ending up on the news you're like that you you are on the news frequently I don't know how this keeps happening and we're talking national news not just like oh yeah local like uh local Nevada
[180:35.14]yeah do you do you have like secret government connections no I don't actually it's all been just weird kind of like hey do you want to talk about this duck game on the news I'm like I guess so but um but yeah because everybody's like bored in New York and there's too many people and not enough jobs so they're making up new ones yeah pretty much
[180:57.63]Because I mean, people need like four jobs to live in a shoebox in Manhattan anyway, so... Every person, there's too many people and every person needs four jobs.
[181:06.51]So at some point... People just making shit up.
[181:11.66]But no, I mean, I said, you know, the price of the Switch 2 and some of the games are still too much in my opinion.
[181:18.23]But what I played was nice.
[181:21.30]You know, the stuff is good.
[181:23.01]And I can't wait for Metroid.
[181:25.53]And Donkey Kong was actually really good.
[181:28.17]I was, like, sold.
[181:29.47]I'm a believer in Donkey Kong.
[181:31.07]Hey, do you want the real facts?
[181:34.48]Is that I'm a huge enthusiast for, like, we need chunkier characters in video gaming.
[181:39.98]Like, I need representation.
[181:41.78]and Donkey Kong really hit that for me, that he looks like his powers are all chunky.
[181:45.81]Like, another Zelda, like, in a skirt, miniskirt, just you, like, climbing with the stamina.
[181:53.13]No, Donkey Kong, like, fucking smashes the wall, doesn't give a shit, runs through it, all that stuff.
[181:58.01]Like, it's fantastic.
[181:59.11]I feel like I'm finally getting noticed.
[182:01.01]Did you play the Donkey Kong game?
[182:05.96]I did.
[182:06.76]It's good.
[182:07.20]It's really fun.
[182:08.14]It's really fun.
[182:09.24]It's Minecraft.
[182:12.77]Good, honestly.
[182:15.48]It's like a little bit of Minecraft, a little bit of Mario Odyssey, a little bit of Zelda, and just a whole lot of fucking shit up with your fists.
[182:24.18]And it's really fun.
[182:24.96]Exactly!
[182:26.38]Are they gonna make... It's about time.
[182:27.84]Are we gonna... Is Switch 2 gonna launch, do you think, with a new Super Mario colon something?
[182:34.67]No, it's already... They've already revealed their launch.
[182:37.27]It's just Mario Kart.
[182:38.99]Oh.
[182:39.61]Are you a big Mario Kart-er?
[182:42.89]I am I I've played many in Mario Kart I love Mario Kart the I played this one and it was quite fun I enjoyed it a lot but it would have been nice to have a 3D Mario but the donkey kong has kind of taken the place of the Mario yeah it kind of does seem like chunk chunky Mario that's what that's what I'm saying remember back when Mario was like a real fucking italian plumber
[183:10.90]Yeah.
[183:11.72]And now he's like, woohoo!
[183:12.94]And he does spins when he jumps.
[183:14.08]Woohoohoo!
[183:14.58]He used to talk like this.
[183:16.56]Luigi, my gout is acting up.
[183:19.59]I relate to that.
[183:20.57]Where's the gout?
[183:21.85]Where's the fucking gout?
[183:22.95]Where's the realism?
[183:23.99]And Donkey Kong brings it back and he does it real.
[183:26.23]I know.
[183:27.95]I know what you're saying, Bestie.
[183:29.35]I do.
[183:29.95]Mario got money, man.
[183:30.73]He changed.
[183:46.50]Alright.
[183:46.88]I made some stinky weed.
[183:49.68]I made more money.
[183:50.40]Alright.
[183:56.10]Green crack is almost done.
[183:57.76]Did Luigi change, though?
[183:59.52]Or was it just Mario?
[184:00.80]I think Luigi's kind of been the same.
[184:02.10]I mean, ever since he shot that guy, he's been weird.
[184:05.92]Oh, man, dude.
[184:07.38]That's crazy.
[184:08.72]Forgot about that.
[184:10.77]Um...
[184:11.94]He, uh... I feel like Luigi has genuinely, though, has been more scared.
[184:17.48]Like, before Luigi's Mansion, I don't remember fear being Luigi's primary, like, character trait.
[184:23.57]No, yeah.
[184:23.85]But kind of since then, he's just nervous and scared.
[184:29.97]Are you mean like... Wow, that's actually really good.
[184:37.71]Wait, I need an update here.
[184:40.19]Once upon a time, I was Waluigi.
[184:46.54]I look like Waluigi.
[184:49.32]Okay, but I think maybe I've grown, because I'm trying to say I identify with Donkey Kong, but maybe I'm really a Waluigi and I'm coping?
[184:56.49]Or have I grown?
[184:57.85]I don't know what you're talking about.
[184:59.01]What do you feel like?
[185:00.79]I feel like I've grown.
[185:02.51]I feel like I've earned some Donkey Kong.
[185:05.15]I used to be like tall and lanky like Waluigi but now I feel like I can really embrace the donkey kong who do you want to be I want to be donkey kong I'm looking for validation you could be donkey kong if you want I don't think anyone's gonna stop you dude yeah exactly exactly okay someone might try will you back me up if someone tries hang on I'm being frisked by cop okay I guess that's as far as this goes
[185:36.78]Never mind.

[185:45.18]Diamond pickaxe!
[185:47.72]How do you put clothes on?
[185:51.48]Jack Black should be Donkey Kong.
[185:54.34]Seth Rogen is Donkey Kong.
[185:55.82]Nah, make it Jack.

[189:52.06]Do you want this one?
[189:55.50]I put Girl Scout cookies back on the shelf.
[189:57.54]They made it a lot stronger.
[189:59.25]Shit, now I feel weird.
[190:00.81]Vinny, you look old.
[190:01.74]I need to smoke more weed.
[190:04.90]Smoke the one that... Wait, I feel it.
[190:07.71]I feel haggard.
[190:08.67]Vinny, you have to smoke or you're racist.

[190:17.58]Look.
[190:18.74]Which one?
[190:20.44]Look.
[190:20.60]You're bald.
[190:21.62]Why are you so bright?
[190:23.00]Turn all these lights off.
[190:24.91]It's fucking... This sucks.
[190:32.19]Oh.
[190:33.89]Oh, man.
[190:34.84]What's this one?
[190:39.33]Wait, what happens if you give the NPCs the Tropic Thunder one?
[190:42.87]Does it work?
[190:48.08]Are you suggesting they're not real like you?
[190:50.04]Yes, it does.
[190:50.82]It does.
[190:51.76]It does work.
[190:52.48]So every effect works on... Okay, I get it.
[190:56.44]On this rack right here, the green crack.
[190:58.80]I made a bunch of green crack.
[191:00.72]We should mix it with something, sell it, and put it on the market.
[191:04.44]But we have to remember that recipe.
[191:07.26]Or we can just mix it with one thing.
[191:08.37]You know what I'm saying?
[191:09.92]Green crack with Viagra.
[191:11.52]Alright, what's the price?
[191:14.74]I got it.
[191:15.22]I'm going to mix them.
[191:16.20]Oh no, we're already on the mixer.
[191:18.61]There are some truly insane effects you can get.
[191:20.35]He didn't do anything.
[191:23.99]He grabs it faster.
[191:25.39]Add donuts to calorie-dense weed for explosive.
[191:30.78]Two donuts in a row, I think.
[191:38.58]Calorie dense of weed is crazy.
[191:42.02]That's a statement and a half.
[191:47.91]I'll try something here.
[191:50.65]The game is so bright for me.
[191:51.87]This like actually sucked.
[191:57.90]Maybe you should go sleep under the bridge.
[192:00.04]It's like times 10 bloom.
[192:02.28]How do you grab everything again?
[192:04.18]Right click.
[192:14.57]No, it's so bright.
[192:16.63]Bobby.

[196:23.55]Yeah.
[196:32.81]I've not seen that kind of costume.
[196:34.91]You've never seen the, like, oh, I'm, like, it's me, I'm a doctor, and I have, like, a penis.
[196:40.34]Um, which website is this?
[196:48.29]This has got to be real.
[196:49.25]I mean, I know it is, deep down.
[196:50.71]No, they made the bag costumes at every fucking party store, but the stupid, like, look, it's one of these offensive costumes.
[197:00.50]Offensive penis, doc?
[197:02.06]Oh!
[197:04.06]Wait a minute.

[197:14.55]Oh, that guy's a priest, but he has, like, a penis.
[197:20.10]I can't say I've been to that store.
[197:22.32]I've seen people as large penises.
[197:25.30]Does that count?
[197:26.04]Is that real?
[197:26.58]No.
[197:27.02]I'm telling you, this is real.
[197:27.82]Yeah, but they're not a doctor.
[197:28.66]It has to be a doctor.
[197:34.47]Does nobody know what I'm talking about?
[197:36.09]I don't know what you're talking about.
[197:37.67]I really don't.
[197:39.61]Can you search it up?
[197:40.43]I don't know what you're talking about, but keep talking.
[197:43.79]Please do.
[197:44.55]Whatever you do, don't stop talking about penis doctors.
[197:47.91]Like Halloween bag costumes.
[197:53.29]Bag?
[197:55.45]I feel like I'm getting gas lit here.
[198:00.77]It's an adult costume with an inflatable dick.
[198:06.85]I'm searching this.
[198:09.45]Spirit of Halloween.
[198:11.01]I'm telling you, they make these.
[198:12.09]It's like, oh look, I have like a penis.
[198:14.91]I'm telling you.
[198:16.94]Like, just so you can feel like a real man, or...?
[198:21.04]I'm googling this and there's just all dick talking.
[198:23.04]There's just all inflatable dicks.
[198:25.48]Nothing else.
[198:27.35]It's a doctor with inflatable penis talking.
[198:29.65]It's just not talking.
[198:33.69]Dude, I'm mixing up costumes.
[198:35.81]Is this a dream you had?
[198:37.58]You have another... Yeah, you mix it up for sure.
[198:41.73]You guys know what I'm talking about though, right?
[198:43.49]It's like, you have to.
[198:45.21]I need to find it.
[198:46.37]I don't have to.
[198:47.37]This is not a shared experience.
[198:53.08]There's one thing you're missing that's so important.
[198:55.54]I gotta find this.
[198:56.50]I have to find this.
[198:57.52]Otherwise everyone's gonna think I'm insane.
[199:00.12]This is like a seven bush lights kind of story.
[199:08.58]So... Vinny, your head's huge.
[199:11.00]My head got huge, and I turned into a ginger.
[199:15.14]So... Wait, I want that.
[199:16.44]Okay, dude, there's a hot dog vendor!
[199:19.35]I got one!
[199:19.97]Hot dog vendor with his hot dog... He's a hot dog vendor at a baseball game, but the hot dog is his penis.
[199:25.61]Can you link that?
[199:26.87]Is it like a secret penis, or is it just huge?
[199:29.70]Do we have an HR?
[199:33.04]Is there a bun?
[199:35.46]Oh, God, there better be a bun.
[199:37.08]I'd be so disappointed if there weren't.
[199:38.68]What's the point of the hot dogs?
[199:39.48]Type in funny costume adult into Google.
[199:42.90]Don't do it on your stream.
[199:44.22]But just look, this is what I'm talking about.
[199:46.10]Costume secret adult penis.
[199:50.07]I see a giant baby diaper baby.
[199:55.44]That's funny.
[199:56.74]Don't say secret.
[199:58.32]Just say funny adult costume adult.
[200:01.64]Oh, a banana.
[200:02.22]How about a banana?
[200:03.12]That's what I wrote.
[200:03.80]Funny costume adult.
[200:05.08]This is all very normal for me.
[200:07.75]Funny costume secret adult penis actually does have a very, very funny search option.
[200:14.13]Oh, my God.

[200:40.44]I see it.
[200:41.20]I get it now.
[200:42.06]It makes too much sense Why is he wearing the V for vendetta mask?
[200:46.83]Why does he have the V for Vendetta mask on?
[200:49.70]Because he doesn't want to be caught dead promoting that product.
[200:54.54]Oh, God, there's another one.
[200:56.92]How am I the only one?
[200:58.02]Have you guys never seen these before?

[201:03.98]We can't link it.
[201:05.82]Are you tracing the same link as the skeleton?
[201:07.82]Dude, that skeleton one is fucked up.
[201:11.76]That skeleton one is crazy.
[201:13.50]Why is it so long?

[201:18.49]That's like two feet.
[201:19.99]Why did you know about these?
[201:22.05]I don't know what none of us know about these.
[201:23.67]How do you guys not know?
[201:25.79]Jeremiah, I really don't think I've ever seen secret adult penis costumes at Comic-Con.
[201:31.92]No, not at Comic-Con.
[201:33.38]Like 13, 14.
[201:35.75]Why would people do that?
[201:37.29]Why would people do that to the Joker?
[201:39.28]I thought you were- wait, wait, wait.
[201:40.52]You wanted to know- Jerma, you wanted to know- Oh shit, I'm getting arrested!

[201:46.78]Good, good.
[201:47.30]You wanted to know if there were more Jokers or secret adult penis men at Comic-Con.
[201:52.11]No, I'm saying in general, like on Halloween.
[201:55.93]Oh.
[201:58.17]Definitely more Jokers.
[202:00.90]Definitely more Jokers.
[202:02.88]Yeah, considering I've never seen... Esther, you should smoke this weed.
[202:10.84]Give me, give me.
[202:12.34]It's in the tray there.
[202:13.69]I wish I could show the skeleton.
[202:16.23]I know, it's so funny.
[202:17.43]You'd have to censor it, but yeah, that would be a vacation.
[202:20.65]That would be a vacation.
[202:27.13]Jerma, someone in my chat found a good one.
[202:28.85]I think you'll like it.
[202:29.67]This is, like, probably... Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
[202:31.99]That's exactly what you were talking about, right?
[202:33.35]That's exactly what I was describing.
[202:35.01]Exactly.
[202:35.57]Oh, yeah.
[202:35.87]Exactly.

[205:56.34]I think those are just... I think those people should just... Do they come with fake asses in the back?
[206:04.06]They do, yeah.
[206:05.88]Oh.
[206:07.12]Do they not have real ones?
[206:11.41]I'm trying to hide.
[206:11.89]Hold on.
[206:23.42]Dremel, can you stop running from the police and come and like go to bed?
[206:27.23]I've been trying.
[206:30.27]I've got on that outfit you told me to wear.
[206:33.69]Secret doctor ass out.
[206:40.76]Come on, let's go.
[206:44.36]It's like, now that you say all this stuff, and we looked at the stuff, yeah, I've seen that stuff on Halloween, but Comic-Con, I think they might have a no inflatable penis rule at Comic-Con, because I've never seen inflatable penises.
[207:00.23]Not that you were asking that, I'm just telling you, in my experience, experientially, I think they might kick you out if you come in with an inflatable penis.
[207:10.94]He's the hot dog guy at Comic Con with the secret dick.
[207:14.40]Imagine being the hot dog guy at anywhere, dude.
[207:17.16]I feel like that's like... It's like, bro, that costume is fucking stupid.
[207:21.70]I wear pants and underwear and I always have a secret dick.
[207:25.23]That's true.
[207:27.69]That's true.
[207:32.02]But the cool thing about the hot dog man is, since it's kind of a hidden, almost secretive, if you will, costume, you could go anywhere with that.
[207:41.54]You could just be like, I'm a hot dog guy.
[207:43.09]This is my profession.
[207:44.01]What's the problem?
[207:44.69]My favorite part about that picture is his face and the way that he's grabbing both ends and just, like, he's lifting it up.
[207:51.99]He's like, yeah, look at this.
[207:54.41]He's having so much fun.
[207:56.09]It's a filter, right?
[207:57.27]He could have been a model.
[207:59.81]Why is he doing that?
[208:02.69]His acting career didn't quite take off.
[208:07.42]I kind of, that's the crazy thing is I kind of think I want that costume now.
[208:12.40]Oh, now all of a sudden you're going to want to wear it.
[208:16.62]We should sell the secret dick costume.
[208:20.63]New merch opportunities available.
[208:23.31]I just love the phrase secret dick.
[208:26.83]Secret dick gear.
[208:30.07]Nobody knows.
[208:30.90]I worded it bad.
[208:34.32]I worded it wrong.
[208:35.68]Hot dog penis costume.
[208:40.08]It's the first one.
[208:40.86]It's on eBay.
[208:41.99]Penis hot dog sexy dirty apron.
[208:45.89]costume funny bucks stack that's what I mean it was always like dirty offensive oh offend your friends with this offensive dirty sex costume that's what they would market it as that oh man oh gosh I found it for 35 bucks that's the quickest that's the easiest purchase I think I've ever heard of that's a steal that's a steal
[209:17.46]I googled like a random character to see if there was a secret penis costume for that character, if it was real.
[209:23.68]See if the theory would... I tried Goku.
[209:26.81]Doesn't work.
[209:28.17]See, you typed in secret penis Goku.
[209:31.23]Secret penis Goku costume.
[209:32.43]I wanna see if it was real for like all characters.
[209:35.43]If there was a market.
[209:37.69]Your whole tangent has been thrown off.
[209:39.62]I don't know if you should type in that, that's gonna get you a lot of results.
[209:48.91]I know, guys.
[209:49.61]I can't show that.
[209:51.87]I can't show this one.
[209:52.91]Okay, this one is like... This one's gross.
[209:55.73]It's actually disgusting, and I'm not gonna show them.
[209:59.47]I gotta sneeze, though.
[210:01.93]Secret sneeze!
[210:02.59]Secret!
[210:04.38]Secret!
[210:08.34]God.
[210:09.00]This is just like brain-dead gaming hours.
[210:12.80]This is fun.
[210:13.84]I love it.
[210:14.24]Don't show this on stream.
[210:15.00]Don't show this one.
[210:18.10]I'm just trying to search for things now.
[210:20.02]It's not a costume.
[210:21.28]This is just like a 3D model.
[210:22.86]What is that?
[210:23.64]Are we just sending characters with modified penis now?
[210:28.32]That's the Mario ASCII dick thing that people post and get insta-banned.
[210:32.25]Super Mario with a dick is just like a 3D model file.
[210:35.83]That's the ASCII art that everybody gets banned for.
[210:38.49]I do not understand how I make like one weird comment per stream and it's like, oh, Ster.
[210:43.69]What the fuck?
[210:44.73]I'm telling you, you've been getting fucking weird.
[210:46.43]It's so gross, dude.
[210:48.53]Yeah.
[210:49.33]Jerma's been crashing out.
[210:52.55]What is the context of that?
[210:53.75]Hey, whatever.
[210:55.37]Jerma's crashing, you know, whatever, out.
[210:59.55]Whatever.
[211:00.91]Listen.
[211:03.55]We're just having fun.

[211:07.66]Just chilling.
[211:08.14]I learned a lot, honestly.
[211:09.48]I'm loving it, too.
[211:10.36]Like, I really want to search more.
[211:11.86]Like, did you search Vegeta?
[211:14.58]Like, just Goku?
[211:16.42]What if there was Vegeta and not Goku?
[211:18.40]Similar to Vegeta that you could probably look up.
[211:20.91]I just felt wrong typing it.
[211:22.05]You know what's so funny?
[211:23.87]Is... I'm walking around the game right now.
[211:26.73]Three of you are nowhere to be found.
[211:28.01]You were all googling secret dick costumes and Mario's penis and stuff.
[211:33.65]Like, I'm playing the game.
[211:35.07]I just was picking up trash.

[212:14.55]Ah.

[212:18.26]It's probably French or something.
[212:29.52]Is there a reason I can't put... Okay.
[212:31.20]Look at all this trash.
[212:33.38]Guys, we have a lot of weed.

[222:31.47]That stuff that is like gingivitis or whatever they're calling it, that's good stuff to smoke.
[222:41.79]Ah yeah, we mixed this weed with my grandma's dentures.
[222:46.20]I'm just hearing explosions.
[222:47.34]Who did you sell it to?
[222:48.14]What happened?
[222:48.52]What happened?
[222:48.84]What happened?
[222:54.65]Dude, okay, something is going on out here.
[222:57.33]What was happening?
[222:58.49]I think Poke is selling all the supply to end people, you know.
[223:03.86]But then we don't have any customers anymore.
[223:06.04]Yeah, Poke, wait, what?
[223:08.30]Will they wake up the next day?
[223:09.82]They get up the next day?
[223:10.54]Oh, okay.
[223:12.80]Well, once they buy it once, they're not going to buy more, right?
[223:16.12]Unless they like feeling the sensation.
[223:18.94]I mean, the next day, I mean.
[223:20.98]Oh, shit, guys, over here.
[223:21.98]We can hire Benji.
[223:23.88]Jerma Presby and look at yourself.
[223:26.42]Pretty good.
[223:26.86]Am I huge?
[223:30.69]So run to me.
[223:31.09]Huge and ginger.
[223:33.19]Run to me.
[223:34.99]Why?
[223:35.31]That way.
[223:35.59]Yeah, run that way.
[223:37.17]Why?
[223:38.09]Come.
[223:42.95]You're going to be okay.
[223:44.81]Because you're smart.
[223:50.23]The cops are coming after me.
[223:52.25]Oh, shit.
[223:53.49]I was there for a reason.
[223:57.15]Oh, my bad.
[223:59.49]I believed in you.
[224:00.03]I trust the call.
[224:00.81]It was going to be hearts.
[224:07.88]You taught me this.
[224:10.60]Frick.
[224:13.60]Where are we going, officers?
[224:15.80]Catching some fucking pothead?
[224:17.46]Yeah.
[224:19.20]You want to hit this?
[224:23.05]No?
[224:24.23]Hey, go get those.
[224:25.65]Go get those fucking scumbags.
[224:30.21]The plurpetrator.
[224:35.03]Why do I hear clown music?
[224:37.19]No!
[224:38.37]No!
[224:43.09]So should I not be making this explosive weed?
[224:47.16]I think if that's your calling.
[224:49.92]Didn't we want to be Batman with the dick?
[224:55.02]So you see, what we're gonna do is, we're all gonna have secret penis costumes, and at the same time we're gonna inflate them at the same time, and then we can kill the Batman with it.
[225:04.99]Kill the Batman.
[225:05.83]Kill the Batman.
[225:08.97]We'll make this weed.
[225:09.77]We'll make him smoke it.
[225:10.67]He'll smoke it.
[225:11.25]He always orders weed from me.
[225:12.81]He's a fucking idiot.
[225:13.59]He doesn't even know it's me.
[225:14.45]I'm in my costume.
[225:17.08]But there's a... He doesn't know that I have a secret penis.
[225:20.12]There's a flap.
[225:21.97]Just around my pantaloons so I can reveal it at any time.
[225:25.29]This doesn't seem like a good idea.
[225:26.88]Everybody knows you got a penis.
[225:29.78]But that doesn't know.
[225:31.36]This one is huge and inflatable.
[225:38.00]It'll inflate at a rate unknown by Matt.
[225:41.67]And knock out the Batman in half.
[225:44.13]And then I can kill him after he is immobilized by my secret penis.
[225:50.62]Oh, that's brilliant, Joker.
[225:52.95]That's the most brilliant plan I've ever heard.
[225:57.43]Peter.
[225:59.11]Oh, yeah, I guess I kind of dig into that a little.
[226:01.75]I better.
[226:04.33]That's all I got.
[226:06.50]Joker, can't we just hit him with a fucking wrench?
[226:14.86]What are we doing?
[226:28.09]What are we doing?
[226:29.09]I don't know anything.
[226:30.07]I don't know anything anymore.
[226:31.45]Poker's exploding people outside.
[226:34.14]And then we just smoke in.
[226:47.40]Oh, crap.
[226:50.80]My body is a machine.
[226:54.08]I'm going to the casino right now.
[226:56.39]I was going to the casino, and then Pope got me caught, and I don't have money to go to the casino anymore.
[227:00.03]Oh, yeah.
[227:01.05]Who's got money?
[227:03.45]I'm taking out... I got 300.
[227:05.65]I've got 300.
[227:07.03]I'm selling weed, so I'm... Wait.

[236:45.74]Okay, then we should really try to do VRChat soon.
[236:49.46]Yeah, I've got to set that up.
[236:50.88]After Warcraft.
[236:52.24]Vinny, I feel like you're really good at getting a big list of nice maps.
[236:56.56]I got good sick fucking maps.
[236:57.64]And I'm telling you, I have like a vision where we just go through it and I'm like, oh, cool, let's go next.
[237:01.56]And we just have like 100 plus maps.
[237:04.42]I'm so cool with just being a passenger and just kind of watching the Disney ride.
[237:09.64]Yes, sir.
[237:10.08]Alright, cool.
[237:11.18]Well, yeah, I say we do Warcraft and then we consider VRChat after that.

[237:24.67]17th?
[237:25.19]You guys are on the 17th?
[237:26.89]If you get into the VR, you just switch to desktop mode.
[237:29.08]That's true.
[237:29.42]It won't be too bad.
[237:31.38]Yeah, VR is, you know, takes a little extra.

[238:34.82]When I come back, we're going to play maybe like 30, 40 minutes of Chrono Trigger.
[238:40.76]Maybe like an hour.
[238:42.18]30, 40 minutes.
[238:48.63]I think that sounds good.
[238:50.59]We're getting pretty close.

[238:59.44]But yeah, and we'll play Corner Trigger.
[239:00.85]Be right back.
[239:02.43]Don't go anywhere unless you have to go, unless you're tired.
