[00:01.09]Good afternoon.
[00:01.49]How you doing?
[00:07.69]On time.
[00:08.13]Yeah.
[00:10.84]Yeah.
[00:13.00]Anybody bet on this?
[00:17.80]No bets for this?
[00:21.66]Oh, okay.
[00:29.01]But you mean I could have been like 10 minutes late?
[00:31.35]If there was a bet, I was like, oh, maybe they bet on this.
[00:33.07]I better get in there and turn it on.
[00:34.31]No, I'm kidding.
[00:34.75]I'm here.
[00:34.97]I'm going to play Slime Rancher again.
[00:37.31]Played it last night.
[00:39.92]I think it's great.
[00:42.58]And I'm going to get my fill.
[00:44.70]So we'll see after today if that's the case.
[00:53.09]After three streams on Jerma985Twitch.TV...
[00:57.20]We have to decide if I'm going to continue or if three's enough.
[01:02.40]We'll find out.
[01:04.72]I do love the game, though.
[01:05.58]It's a chill, fun thing to do.
[01:07.87]I'm really into it.
[01:10.95]Please wish me a happy birthday.
[01:12.75]Your name is so dark, I couldn't even read your name.
[01:16.43]It's like a dark navy blue.
[01:18.55]It blends in with the background.
[01:19.29]I can't even read it.
[01:20.47]I couldn't even read your name.
[01:21.81]Happy birthday, whoever you are.
[01:28.39]What was your name?
[01:33.27]Happy birthday.
[01:33.91]Can you not wish me a happy birthday?
[01:42.56]That's just every day that's not your birthday.
[01:50.76]We're going to get right into this.
[01:51.76]I don't need to introduce this at all.
[01:54.59]This is three streams in a row of Slime Ranchers, so I don't really need to talk that much about it.
[01:59.73]There was something I wanted you guys to remind me of.
[02:02.89]And I was thinking about it before I turned the stream on.
[02:05.25]I have a drill, right?
[02:07.17]I have two drills.
[02:08.73]It was something else.
[02:12.37]It was the drills and something else.
[02:18.27]explain the game um these little creatures you feed them and they shit out money that's the entire game there's nothing else in the game it's just collecting creatures that go to the bathroom and then you make money off of their bathroom that's I mean it's pretty cool
[02:39.69]Okay, let's go.
[02:41.55]Let's go.
[02:41.99]Don't need to waste any time.
[02:42.95]Here we are.
[02:43.36]We're already in the game.
[02:44.14]I've been waiting.
[02:44.90]I've been ready.
[02:46.58]I've been sitting here the entire day just waiting for exactly 2 p.m.
[02:50.80]to go through.
[02:52.14]Or 2.30.
[02:52.24]So I can turn it on and play.
[02:57.30]Move this a little bit.
[02:58.06]That's going to distract me.
[02:58.88]Okay.
[03:01.76]It's done.
[03:02.92]Can you guys hear it?
[03:03.64]Yes, you can.
[03:04.26]We're good to go.
[03:08.15]Get to the dentist.
[03:08.97]For what?
[03:11.26]I need to go to the dentist?
[03:15.34]Remember, people are going to start thinking your name is actually Andy.
[03:20.00]Um, I don't, I don't think so.
[03:22.10]I don't think they're going to think that.
[03:24.00]Alright.
[03:29.09]The last thing.
[03:30.09]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:30.75]The drills, the drills.
[03:31.41]We got to go to the drills.
[03:34.35]Wait, suck up.
[03:38.54]Your name isn't Andy.
[03:40.83]Oh, we got Oka.
[03:41.39]Oka.
[03:41.59]Good, good, good.
[03:42.03]Yeah, I remember the plan here.
[03:44.77]I got a lot of money.
[03:46.09]Right.
[03:46.29]No, it was buy the docks.
[03:47.59]That's what you guys supposed to remind me.
[03:51.21]You guys supposed to remind me to buy the docks and take the stuff out of the drill.
[03:56.08]That's not what you're doing right now.
[03:57.06]You're just saying Andy.
[03:58.66]That's not helping me.
[03:59.36]It doesn't help me.
[04:00.36]I tried.
[04:07.16]I tried.
[04:09.63]No, it's not just one of you that has to try.
[04:11.83]It's like 3,000 of you have to try because I can't read one person's comment.
[04:18.15]You have to all just amalgamize into one comment.
[04:25.10]What about the one guys?
[04:26.00]Yeah, but that's different.
[04:33.46]Okay, the drills are over here.
[04:39.26]No, wait.
[04:39.56]I want to get the Oka Oka.
[04:43.23]I need the Hive Mine to yell at me.
[04:44.81]Yeah.
[04:50.03]If you missed last night's stream, or you didn't stay the whole time, we just got Crystals and we just got Rad Slimes.
[04:57.95]And I combined the Crystal and the Rad Slime and made a Crystal Rad Slime.
[05:04.37]Oh, boy.
[05:06.76]You missed it.
[05:09.96]Stop saying among us.
[05:12.82]Okay, let's go.
[05:15.64]Dude, that's sick.
[05:16.30]Why are you saying among us?
[05:22.85]I said that.
[05:23.39]No, I didn't.
[05:25.87]When did I say among us?
[05:30.63]Alright, let's get some money.
[05:38.02]And then, let's let them eat.
[05:40.64]Oka Oka is their favorite food.
[05:47.22]Okay.
[05:47.48]I'm going to sell this.
[05:51.65]Look at those crystals.
[05:55.33]Has the price gone up?
[05:56.41]I wonder.
[06:01.85]You forgot what?
[06:02.39]What did I forget?
[06:02.83]Okay.

[06:36.91]Shit!
[06:37.17]I didn't mean to do that.
[06:38.77]It'll be fine.
[06:43.83]It's the hive mind.
[06:44.88]But why is the hive mind saying among us?
[06:47.50]Alright, I know you're a hive mind, but why is the hive mind saying among us?
[06:52.30]I need an explanation for it.
[06:53.26]Because we're toxic.
[06:59.73]Oh.
[07:00.91]Oh.
[07:04.98]Why are you guys doing this?
[07:05.82]Because we're toxic.
[07:07.35]Oh, okay.
[07:08.33]What are you doing?
[07:15.39]38?
[07:15.61]This at least went down in value.
[07:16.69]I should have held.
[07:22.00]We know it pisses you off.
[07:25.90]No, it doesn't.
[07:26.34]It's a joke.
[07:28.62]I don't even care.
[07:29.38]I don't even care.
[07:32.89]They think that like it makes me mad.
[07:34.34]I don't even fucking care.
[07:36.86]Oh my god.
[07:38.34]Imagine thinking like I cared about that.
[07:41.18]Oh, you're really getting to me.
[07:42.24]I don't care.
[07:42.98]You're just wasting so much time saying that.
[07:46.93]Don't fucking even care.
[07:52.57]I need to donate this stuff.
[07:55.25]You're a Jerma.
[07:55.87]You're a valley girl.
[08:03.34]I want to donate and then we're going to check on the drills.
[08:06.50]Yes.
[08:10.16]How am I a valley girl?
[08:12.38]What's this quest?
[08:14.53]This guy.
[08:15.67]Working on a new recipe.
[08:16.51]Help me out.
[08:16.87]What does he want?
[08:21.35]Oh, those rewards are terrible.
[08:24.63]I mean, eight chickens.
[08:25.77]I can go get eight chickens right now in my backyard.
[08:27.84]No, not even worth it.
[08:32.35]All the upgrades are done.
[08:33.31]Alright, let's go.
[08:34.65]This way.
[08:40.14]Do it.
[08:40.62]No.
[08:42.32]I can go pick up eight chickens right now in 15 seconds.
[08:45.46]It's not worth it.
[08:54.81]He said, I'm willing to pay you to talk to my friend.
[08:57.31]She's anti-Jerma.
[09:01.56]I don't... That's okay.
[09:02.79]I don't care.
[09:08.87]That's fine.
[09:09.77]That's... Look, you can... We don't all have to like the same TV shows.
[09:18.88]Oh, I need to donate these.
[09:19.72]Shit.
[09:27.54]Yes, we do.
[09:32.75]If we all like the same TV shows, how would we argue with each other about what the best TV show is?
[09:37.97]Or what season was the best?
[09:41.17]Guys, there are a lot of you.
[09:42.25]There are a ton of you among us here.
[09:43.25]There's a lot of you here.
[09:52.81]would argue about the arcs of this channel.
[09:55.77]Oh, yeah, Boston Arc was better than Vegas Arc.
[09:58.29]No, no, no, no, no.
[09:59.85]Jerma Basement Arc was better than Jerma, uh, Boston Arc.
[10:04.57]I mean, that happens here.
[10:05.45]Jerma Arc Tier List.
[10:18.86]Jerma Arc Tier List.
[10:23.41]Okay, there's been like two.
[10:26.72]There's been two.
[10:30.64]Actually, there's been actually quite a few arcs, hasn't there?
[10:33.20]Are they arcs or are they... What would you even call them?
[10:47.95]There's seasons.
[10:53.22]It'd be kind of funny to name streams with the title, like, seasons in them.
[11:00.03]Like, what's the title right now?
[11:03.31]Like, oh, Slime Rancher.
[11:04.77]Like, getting that money.
[11:06.93]Jerma Season 3 Episode 40 or something.
[11:12.92]But that season finale is like something crazy would have to happen.
[11:16.96]We'd have to have season finales.
[11:24.52]Are these ready?
[11:25.90]Oh, only two minutes?
[11:27.78]Alright, two minutes and 27 seconds and I can get these.
[11:31.64]Catboy is season finale.
[11:34.96]I don't know if I agree.
[11:35.72]I don't think I agree with that.
[11:42.91]I think Catboy would be series finale.
[11:46.29]Because Netflix ain't picking it up for another season after that one.
[11:58.27]Netflix is going to be like, we didn't like the direction of the Catboy stuff.
[12:02.34]We're not going to be redoing Jerma N85 for a fourth season.
[12:13.13]Alright, put these hens over here.
[12:15.03]How do I burn two minutes?
[12:16.05]How do I kill two minutes?
[12:16.77]What's your opinion on the word plort?
[12:21.11]I think it's pretty sick.
[12:22.53]Next question, please. ...
[12:37.03]What are you doing?
[12:38.91]That's your question?
[12:39.61]Hey, what are you doing?
[12:49.01]Next question, please.
[12:50.39]What are you doing?
[12:50.97]I don't know.
[12:52.63]What are you up to?
[12:53.27]What are you doing?
[12:53.97]How are you?
[12:54.39]How are you doing?
[12:55.47]I don't know why I thought that was so funny.
[13:00.16]Look at all this.
[13:01.36]This is... Hey, excuse me.
[13:02.84]How am I feeling?
[13:04.88]I'm feeling pretty good.
[13:06.67]It's been a good day.
[13:08.49]I forgot that this existed.
[13:09.66]Now I'm going to have a lot of these.
[13:10.62]Are you free tonight?
[13:24.28]No.
[13:25.28]Sorry.
[13:28.03]I'm not free tonight.
[13:33.25]I didn't... I gotta put something over here.
[13:36.58]Like, alright, what do I put over here?
[13:38.13]High walls, music box.
[13:39.65]Just do it.
[13:40.05]Air net.
[13:41.75]What collector?
[13:42.37]I got to put something over here.
[13:43.29]Auto feeder.
[13:45.61]I got to get something in here.
[13:49.09]What should I put over here?
[13:49.75]Hmm.
[13:52.48]I'll figure it out.
[13:52.96]Alright.
[13:58.30]Chickens are doing good.
[13:58.94]I got my mangoes.
[14:04.42]I already asked if I could sleep over and then your mom said yes.
[14:08.54]Oh, I get it.
[14:12.57]Was that like an insult or something?
[14:14.41]I don't know what that means.
[14:15.55]That's like an insult.
[14:30.50]What do you mean?
[14:30.90]No, he just asked.
[14:32.75]Wait, that wasn't like a... Hey, man, I already asked your mom if I could sleep over.
[14:37.33]She said, yes, I'm sleeping over with your mom.
[14:40.51]That wasn't what that was?
[14:41.53]I thought that's what that was.
[14:42.27]What is this?
[14:52.64]Oh, shit.
[14:53.04]There's a mango in here.
[14:56.09]That'll fill up.
[15:00.52]How we doing?
[15:00.94]Alright.
[15:01.18]Now it's two minutes going up.
[15:03.07]I think it's time to check out the drill.
[15:07.11]Yep.
[15:08.34]Drill time.
[15:13.49]They asked you for your mother's permission.
[15:16.18]But wouldn't... Okay, but wouldn't your mother need to ask my mother for permission to make sure, like, it was real?
[15:21.56]Wait, why would you... In the scenario for both, like, kids, you have to ask my mom if you can sleep over.
[15:28.18]Wouldn't, like, your parents need to be the ones to be like, hey, can, like, Timmy sleep over tonight?
[15:34.29]Like, hey, can I sleep over tonight?
[15:35.25]Well, we have to check with your mom.
[15:40.35]Yes.
[15:40.81]Yeah.

[16:49.83]Alright, I can make some more of these.
[16:51.93]I'm going to put another one there.
[17:02.86]That's a real element.
[17:05.06]Unobtainium is a real element?
[17:08.34]I feel like that's a lie.
[17:14.26]That's an unobtainium.
[17:20.12]I don't think that's real.
[17:22.14]I want crystals.
[17:31.61]I'm going to do one more cell.
[17:35.03]And then I'm going to get out of here.
[17:36.35]We're going to go explore.

[18:22.24]Find the person that started me down that path and I want them out of here for 15 minutes.
[18:37.99]No, I'm sorry, Jeremo.
[18:42.81]Ugh.
[18:44.78]Sorry.
[18:45.20]I'm so sorry.
[18:47.29]I didn't mean to.
[18:48.21]I don't even need these hens.
[18:58.29]Does anybody eat meat over here?
[18:59.39]Somebody does down here.
[19:04.65]You can't ban us all.
[19:07.99]No, you're right.
[19:08.63]I cannot ban you all.
[19:10.95]I can't.
[19:17.27]But I can.
[19:21.73]There's some things I can do.
[19:26.43]I can put it into sub only.
[19:28.83]Five minute slow mode.
[19:29.97]And then that's goodbye.
[19:33.07]Can't hear you anymore.
[19:43.14]Okay, good.
[19:43.64]We'll have one more haul to deliver.
[19:45.28]I know these guys have a shitload.
[19:47.52]Yes, they do.
[19:49.62]Not really.
[19:55.48]Do it.
[19:56.38]No, I'm not.
[19:56.94]I just, I can do it.
[19:57.94]It doesn't mean I'm going to do it.
[19:58.92]It means I can.
[20:06.33]Oh, I wonder if I should.
[20:08.07]No, I'll just sell if he cares.
[20:09.03]Alright, now I'm going to buy the dock.
[20:13.13]And we're going to go to the dock.
[20:14.15]Hell yeah, 15 grand.
[20:14.78]I'm going to go.
[20:15.40]I'm going to sleep.
[20:16.58]I'm going to go to the dock.
[20:17.50]And here we go.
[20:17.98]I'm a dog that just got out of the bath.
[20:19.58]I had to really shake violently around.
[20:43.20]To the point where you look at the dog and you're like, does their brain shake around like crazy when they do that?
[20:47.07]Doesn't that give them a headache?
[20:47.79]Alright, the dog was down here, right?
[21:05.28]When a dog shakes, that like... You know what I'm talking about.
[21:11.87]They shake, shake, shake.
[21:12.83]It starts off kind of slow.
[21:14.01]It's like shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[21:18.78]That seems like it would be like, holy shit, that's fast.
[21:26.04]No, no, not growling.
[21:26.88]Like that's the vibrations of them shaking.
[21:33.67]Here we go.
[21:33.99]The docks.
[21:35.09]Deep down in the great blue sea, I saw a thousand slime smiling back at me.
[21:38.73]Let's go.
[21:40.15]Dock bought.
[21:44.43]Here we go, boys and girls.
[21:45.83]Oh my God.
[21:46.83]Oh, it's just another area.
[21:48.23]Okay, fuck.
[21:49.16]I didn't even need to do this.
[21:52.54]There was nothing here?
[21:54.02]Oh, it's just extra space.
[22:02.29]Well, I don't even need this.
[22:04.51]At least not now.
[22:08.93]You got baited.
[22:09.75]Well, not really.
[22:11.53]So where can I use this other key?
[22:17.98]Why do I use the key?
[22:25.23]You need to sing a raid song?
[22:34.45]Thanks for the raid.
[22:35.01]Who raided?
[22:36.39]C or Max.
[22:37.11]Thanks for the raid.
[22:38.02]Welcome everybody.
[22:40.86]Playing, uh, I almost said playing Among Us.
[22:44.30]Yeah, currently playing Among Us.
[22:45.35]You guys keep fucking saying it, and then you keep writing it.
[22:48.81]You're burning it into my head.
[22:50.47]It's half of every message.
[22:52.57]It's half of every single message.
[22:55.33]Every single one.
[22:57.95]I can't get away from it.
[22:59.94]It's all I can read.
[23:01.04]Alright, I need to open up a door.
[23:09.59]Wait, couldn't I... Didn't I get a treasure unlocking ability thing?
[23:11.81]I did, didn't I?
[23:13.53]Alright.
[23:14.01]I need to... I'm going to open up a door.
[23:20.00]Where is there another door I can open?
[23:21.34]I have two keys, don't I?
[23:23.24]I have one key.
[23:24.86]Isn't there one down here?
[23:25.66]I swear to God there is.
[23:29.16]I swear to God.
[23:30.74]Yeah, there it is.
[23:31.16]Alright, cool.
[23:31.51]I'm going to open this up.
[23:37.63]What's this way?
[23:39.75]I don't know.
[23:40.07]Why would I... Should I get this?
[23:46.41]I don't know if this is worth doing.
[23:47.61]This doesn't look worth it.
[23:51.72]I gotta go back here.
[23:54.88]And then open this over here.
[23:56.38]This is a shortcut.
[24:01.62]Yeah, I gotta get the last area.
[24:02.96]Alright, I'm gonna go back to here.
[24:04.78]We'll go back to the crystal place.
[24:16.16]Okay, yeah, back to the crystal place.
[24:21.58]I already unlocked that area.
[24:24.48]Yeah, is there a cave that I can open a door?
[24:26.40]Because I got the two keys last time.
[24:33.70]Ban the word among us.
[24:35.32]You know, that sounds fantastic, actually.
[24:38.26]That sounds like a great idea.
[24:42.02]That sounds like a fantastic idea.
[24:53.27]Among Us.
[24:54.95]Why?
[25:06.14]You know, when I watch meme compilation videos and a bunch of shit about Among Us pops up and I'm in a room with more than one or two people, I have to pretend to know what's funny about it.
[25:18.08]And I'm just like, I mean, like, I know that crew member.
[25:21.04]I have no idea what's going on.
[25:24.67]Are you five?
[25:25.93]What do you mean?
[25:31.00]Watching meme compilation videos?
[25:32.84]What's wrong?
[25:33.26]Is there something wrong with that?
[25:39.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[25:41.57]Everybody.
[25:42.47]I want to silence.
[25:43.54]I need to go over this.
[25:45.04]You guys have not had autoplay on and you just don't care what plays next.
[25:51.07]And eventually it always leads back to a meme compilation video.
[25:54.81]Eventually, even like a few hours could go by.
[26:02.59]And then somehow, for some reason that cannot be explained, you end up on the daily dose of internet video page and you just let them play and you don't stop.
[26:14.92]You just sit there for like two hours.
[26:16.74]You don't, it doesn't even, it could be four hours.
[26:19.80]You just sit there.
[26:25.51]I didn't, I didn't click on that.
[26:26.95]It just, it was like, oh, this is like autoplaying and this is this video's next and the autoplay roulette.
[26:31.31]And then this, and then here we are the daily dose of internet.
[26:33.79]Here we go.
[26:35.88]I'm just, I guess this is what's going to, I'm going to be, it's going to be on TV for the next hour.
[26:41.32]Could I reach the controller and like turn it off?
[26:43.96]Like on my like TV or my iPad or my iPhone?
[26:47.34]I could, but how am I going to wipe my ass?
[27:18.77]Don't you see, uh, like, an iPhone propped up with, like, two or three tubes of toothpaste on the sink facing me while I'm sitting there just, like, enjoying myself?
[27:31.82]I need to go to the bathroom.
[27:41.95]Fuck.
[27:42.13]Okay.
[27:42.77]Okay, we gotta pivot away from this right now.
[27:44.55]Uh...
[27:48.18]Jesus Christ.
[27:49.04]I'm sorry.
[27:49.54]I know.
[27:50.20]Somebody said... I'm sorry.
[28:05.65]I have to get the fuck out of here.
[28:08.65]Thank God there's no webcam on.
[28:10.39]I can't be trusted with a live broadcast.
[28:12.63]I can't.
[28:15.60]See, on YouTube, on YouTube, I would be recording and I would say something fucking stupid or crazy like that.
[28:21.16]And who just would not appear in a video?
[28:22.92]It would happen all the time.
[28:23.74]Okay, I want to go.
[28:32.19]Let's forget that was going on and let's go.
[28:34.21]Oh, I have a shortcut to here.
[28:35.29]I'm stupid.
[28:36.97]Wait.
[28:39.33]Ooh.
[28:41.01]Treasure pod.
[28:45.22]Give me these.
[28:45.50]Don't touch these.
[28:47.24]Slime fossil.
[28:48.08]Holy shit.
[28:48.48]I know there's like a lot of those around the world.
[28:54.22]Advance pump.
[28:54.92]Ooh.
[28:59.01]I forgot I had a shortcut to right here.
[29:00.83]I'm an idiot.
[29:04.15]Now I have to go back.
[29:04.89]Fuck.
[29:05.55]Okay.
[29:06.39]I promise we're going to make progress in a second here.
[29:09.19]I'm going to go deposit this.
[29:10.23]Uh-oh.
[29:10.63]Oh.
[29:12.03]Oh, God.
[29:12.63]Oh, God.
[29:19.39]It's the Among Us shit.
[29:20.64]You guys just fucking me up.
[29:21.76]You're just messing me up.
[29:23.28]It's just completely screwing me up.
[29:25.88]You threw me off right at the very beginning of the stream.
[29:27.96]I just did like, Among Us, Among Us, Among Us.
[29:31.62]Oh, yeah.
[29:34.89]I can't even pay.
[29:35.79]I can't do anything.
[29:37.69]Look at that.
[29:38.03]I got like my Oka Oka's overgrown.
[29:39.35]I can't even pay attention.
[29:40.07]Alright, shit.
[29:48.20]Hold on.
[30:02.65]You realize you're in almost all the Among Us meme compilations.
[30:11.10]Fucking Frankenstein's monster.
[30:17.10]Here's how I feel.
[30:19.58]So in Frankenstein, Frankenstein got up and was like... And he was like, no!
[30:25.02]My creation!
[30:27.28]And he bites Dr. Frankenstein in the neck, right?
[30:30.92]And murders Dr. Frankenstein.
[30:32.46]That's what happens in the movie.
[30:33.76]I don't know, whatever the TV show, the movie, whatever the book was.
[30:36.41]So Dr. Frankenstein gets murdered by Iron Man.
[30:44.88]I was just thinking of, like, if Frankenstein was in the Marvel Universe.
[30:52.82]I promise I'm fine.
[30:55.08]Hold on, let me get these.
[30:58.95]You guys fucked me up bad today.
[31:02.21]So, anyways, that's how I feel.
[31:04.33]I feel about the Among Us meme.
[31:07.13]I begged you guys to stop using that photo to, like, show people me.
[31:13.62]oh yeah have you heard of Jerma oh here's a picture of his wicked ugly face and I'm like I hate that photo stop doing it get rid of it I do anything else please and then you got that imposter face woke up with two bolts in its neck and I was like oh excellent that's a new meme to replace the old one and before it was annoying to me and I didn't want to see it and uh get off me
[31:37.84]I'm not sus.
[31:39.90]What are you talking about?
[31:41.14]That was a sus thing to say.
[31:49.85]I'm passing out.
[31:50.77]He's drinking a ton of blood.
[31:52.95]Yeah, I can't see anymore.
[31:55.67]I'm passing out.
[31:56.11]That's what happened.
[32:14.60]I'm gonna store a lot of this shit This is a chilling slime rancher stream Well, look it's been let me hey, let me get a little bit of credit here it's been it's been 33 minutes and
[32:42.32]And if you were to look at the log of this stream, I know it's available somewhere.
[32:45.04]Do control F among us.
[32:49.63]And I guarantee it's at least 10 to 20,000 messages.
[32:52.88]I guarantee it.
[33:04.91]I would put... I'm not going to put any money on it, but I would maybe if I thought about it.
[33:09.41]There's so many.
[33:11.13]Like, what the hell is happening?
[33:19.50]Oh, I need to get the... They're not going to despawn, right?
[33:26.77]Shit, wrong way.
[33:28.55]How much money, huh?
[33:29.63]An amount that if you were comfortable maybe putting a bet down.
[33:33.13]If you felt like doing a bet, maybe I would.
[33:37.31]Play Among Us for 1.5 billion off the debt.
[33:39.43]No.
[33:40.99]You would have to pay me 1.5 billion real dollars for me to do that.
[33:57.64]Is this a level 1 pod?
[33:59.27]Shit.
[34:03.43]Now I'm ready to explore.
[34:07.71]Full debt wipe if you play Among Us.
[34:09.25]No.
[34:11.43]That's just watering the meme plant.
[34:15.82]No, I can't.
[34:19.76]No, no, no, no.
[34:25.34]Well, you know what?
[34:26.10]Actually, hold on a second here.
[34:28.36]I could stream Among Us and have the title be Imposter is Sus Guy Plays Among Us.
[34:35.50]And I could just be me and I could be smiling and be like, oh, that's sus.
[34:39.06]I'd get probably 100,000 viewers, wouldn't I?
[34:42.72]That's a huge brain play, I think.
[34:45.05]I could look into the camera and smile big and be like, man, that was pretty sus to me.
[34:49.75]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[34:52.52]I would get 100,000 concurrent viewers.
[34:54.98]That's brilliant.
[34:59.23]And then ban every new account that came in.
[35:02.77]That day before that.
[35:04.33]After that.
[35:04.65]I'm kidding.
[35:14.71]No, then ban all accounts that were made.
[35:17.52]And ever follow this channel.
[35:19.58]And then retire.
[35:24.70]Just retire from streaming forever.
[35:28.32]The Imposterous Sus Guy.
[35:31.10]And coming up next, we've got an interview with the Imposterous Sus Guy.
[35:34.29]Should I just lean into that?
[35:37.81]Should I just go to like conventions and be that guy?
[35:40.15]I'll be on like a Twitch panel.
[35:46.59]Oh, we've got the Imposterous Sus Guy on the panel.
[35:49.93]I'll just travel the country and like do the face.
[35:54.27]And that's it, I guess.
[35:57.73]Go on like, go on Fox News.
[36:03.27]Go on like a news program.
[36:09.80]You understand that being the imposter is sus guy requires no work from me at all.
[36:15.74]I just have to be that guy.
[36:18.75]I just have to be that guy on some form of imagery.
[36:21.37]I don't have to do anything.
[36:31.46]Set for life.
[36:36.08]All I need to do is just do one imposter is sus guy.
[36:40.37]Has a stream.
[36:42.09]And have like $20 TTS donations.
[36:45.27]That trigger TTS.
[36:46.03]Yes.
[36:48.29]I think I would probably be able to just retire forever.
[36:56.60]Suss for life.
[37:05.24]Suss for life.
[37:08.04]But the thing is though, I would never do that because I would wake up on my like, I don't know.
[37:12.78]I could be like, it would be like a 45th birthday or something.
[37:16.86]I would wake up in a cold sweat.
[37:19.26]And be like, I'm, no.
[37:21.08]I would have that face.
[37:23.26]I would just see that face.
[37:24.24]I would see it everywhere.
[37:26.47]I would look at, I'd be brushing my teeth in the mirror with that smile.
[37:29.25]Like just smiling and be like, that image is, that's me.
[37:31.79]I'm sus.
[37:40.89]Okay, I'm good.
[37:41.67]I got $12,000.
[37:42.13]Let's... Okay, let's go.
[37:45.11]Wait.
[37:52.91]do you think I'm worth okay let me ask you a question so if let's just say like let's say I put a price tag on like me being in like an imposter video right like some YouTuber or streamer wanted to do like oh I I love I'm a bit I love among us I play it all the time man I wonder if I could get that imposter sus guy on my stream to like like I open like the closet and he's smiling there what do you think that's worth how much could I sell that for do you think what could I actually get from that
[38:24.74]Like, 100k?
[38:26.02]10k at best?
[38:26.78]That's a lot of fucking money.
[38:28.54]Like, 10k?
[38:29.66]Just to be the guy?
[38:30.50]Like, the imposter's sus?
[38:31.48]Like, in, like, somebody's, like, bathroom vent or something?
[38:34.49]They, like, show the camera, and, like, I'm, like, in their, like, AC unit, like, looking out, like, haha!
[38:39.91]That's 10,000?
[38:45.19]Like, they pan up, like, in their bedroom, and I'm, like, in, like, the AC vent?
[38:51.52]Why did I just collect all that money?
[38:52.84]I need to, hold on.
[38:58.61]That would be 50k.
[39:02.39]Big subs.
[39:03.21]We had 25 from Soda Cat, 10 from Albion.
[39:07.07]Thank you, guys.
[39:07.98]Thanks to everybody giving subs.
[39:09.00]You don't have to.
[39:09.48]Okay, I'm going to store this.
[39:13.00]Actually, I'm going to go open that door.
[39:14.50]I want to go open the gate.
[39:16.12]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[39:17.48]I got to pay attention.
[39:19.14]Pay attention.
[39:20.78]Pay attention to the game.
[39:22.92]Store the Oka Oka.
[39:24.87]Sell everything else.
[39:27.39]I'm not trying to make money right now.
[39:30.19]Oh, update.
[39:38.72]You need plorts to unlock this door, not a key.
[39:42.04]Oh.
[39:44.00]Shit.
[39:44.66]Okay.
[39:45.13]Well, what do I need?
[39:45.85]Let's find out.
[39:47.25]What do I need?
[39:53.31]Anyone know what I actually need?
[39:56.91]Well, let's go find out.
[40:04.11]Among us.
[40:12.78]Sus.
[40:15.58]And the only reason why I say that is because I don't really address the sus stuff.
[40:20.76]Because, I mean, like, whatever.
[40:22.58]It's memed.
[40:23.66]It's gone into the meme stratosphere.
[40:25.21]Whatever.
[40:25.45]I don't care.
[40:25.77]It's out of my hands completely.
[40:26.75]Have fun with it.
[40:27.85]Fine.
[40:28.23]Okay, whatever.
[40:28.79]I don't care.
[40:30.67]But, like, Kentucky Fried Chicken tweeted it out.
[40:33.65]like the the Spanish Kentucky fried chicken chicken put the sus guy as colonel sanders I think I could probably make some money on that I think I could probably be like the sus guy in like a fucking among us commercial on like nickelodeon or something right that's big money nickelodeon's big money that's not that's not 5k that's not the nickelodeon's big money if they wanted to get me alright it's uh up here
[41:04.41]Can I make that?
[41:12.94]Sellout Andy.
[41:17.19]Well, call it what you will.
[41:19.47]But, I mean... Well, you all know how I feel about that image.
[41:29.01]If I could make, like, a shitload of money by just smiling in a camera on Nickelodeon one day, are you kidding me?
[41:34.67]I don't have to do anything?
[41:36.05]I just have to be like, hey, I think green just vented.
[41:42.93]And then, like, chatter my teeth.
[41:47.79]And then the director's like, okay, cut.
[41:51.03]And I just sit there and I'm like, alright, that's it.
[41:54.86]Somebody comes up with a huge, like, prices right check.
[41:58.73]A giant one that's like $50,000 on it.
[42:01.03]I just put it under my armpit and fucking put it in my trunk and leave?
[42:07.77]You wouldn't do that too?
[42:13.09]Okay, I want to go this way.
[42:23.92]What does it take to get in here?
[42:27.90]I have self-respect.
[42:29.06]I wouldn't do that.
[42:33.12]I mean... I... I'm just smiling into a camera as the sus guy.
[42:42.91]I'm not like... Like deep-frying a hundred iPhones or something and being like, look what I did!
[42:57.09]Where's this door?
[43:05.13]In there?
[43:10.32]Mommy, I don't like this sus man.
[43:16.74]We're, like, talking about all this and just fucking around and making jokes and stuff.
[43:19.99]But, you know, how funny it would be if I realistically, like, thought about pursuing something like that and being like, I'm available as the sus guy.
[43:25.95]It's worth, like, $300.
[43:26.51]It's like... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:30.66]I mean, you're just smiling into a camera and it's like a meme, kind of.
[43:33.70]And I'm sitting here like, 50 grand, a big check.
[43:39.48]What made you think you... Alright, here we go.
[43:41.47]I'm going in.
[43:46.53]You guys lied to me.
[43:48.95]Wait.
[43:57.01]This is the... I've already been here.
[44:00.91]Do a cameo.
[44:04.01]Now, cameo would not work.
[44:06.19]You understand?
[44:06.71]If I did a cameo as the sus guy, every single cameo is the same.
[44:11.07]One person would buy it for $10 and share it with everyone.
[44:17.27]It would be me doing the sus face and saying like, yeah, happy birthday.
[44:23.70]Nothing would change.
[44:24.36]Alright, how many do I need?
[44:30.55]What do I actually need to do here?
[44:32.73]Do I need to shoot pink into there or just shoot it into the door?
[44:43.18]What do I need to do?
[44:50.63]There are statues.
[44:54.61]Hmm, okay.
[44:55.01]So this is like a hunter plort statue?
[44:57.71]Okay, what about you?
[45:01.80]Green plort statue.
[45:04.34]Looking for the hunter statue.
[45:05.56]Are you a hunter?
[45:07.60]You are... That's honey, right?
[45:10.90]Ooh.
[45:13.29]I just need one.
[45:13.89]I don't need more than one.
[45:18.97]There's no hunter one.
[45:20.13]Oh, okay.
[45:20.53]So I need.
[45:24.57]This is boom.
[45:26.33]Rad.
[45:27.29]Crystal.
[45:28.91]I think I have all of these.
[45:29.76]I have all this.
[45:33.26]Oh, okay.
[45:33.76]I think, oh, oh, I have all these.
[45:35.18]Can we just have a regular Jerma 95 cameo?
[45:44.04]Sure.
[45:47.44]Absolutely.
[45:49.20]That sounds good to me.
[45:50.04]Yeah, we'll do it right now.
[45:51.90]Let's do it right now.
[46:01.28]You ready here?
[46:05.24]So, here's what's going on.
[46:05.98]Are you ready?

[71:24.37]What happened?
[71:24.71]It's okay.
[71:25.45]It's okay.
[71:25.89]It's okay.
[71:26.33]It's okay.
[71:26.79]It's alright.
[71:27.27]It's okay.
[71:27.61]I don't know what I just did.
[71:29.33]I think he has to die.
[71:30.59]Does he?
[71:32.88]No, he can just be the one that rules them all.
[71:34.45]Okay, that's fine.
[71:37.51]I need that.
[71:38.09]I need that though.
[71:47.11]Shit that out.
[71:47.81]Oh my god, 91.
[71:48.39]Okay, thank you.
[71:52.11]You can go back in.
[71:54.01]Don't go over there.
[71:57.89]Okay, we're good.
[72:09.30]He's gonna turn them all.
[72:12.17]Yeah, he is.
[72:12.71]He is, yep.
[72:14.47]He's gotta go.
[72:15.53]Yeah, get him out.
[72:23.07]He's gonna turn them all.
[72:25.17]My mistake is your demise.
[72:26.91]I'm sorry!
[72:27.97]He can fly!
[72:30.47]He's fine.
[72:51.42]Oh my god, there's a hundred in here.
[72:52.54]Alright, I think I don't need to feed these guys anymore.
[72:59.39]Oh!
[73:08.78]I just heard something.
[73:09.50]A glass break.
[73:22.00]Crewmate ejected.
[73:23.26]Okay.
[73:23.76]I'm actually... I'm not going to read anymore.
[73:25.80]I'm not going to read any more Among Us posts.
[73:29.46]You wanted to talk about Among Us?
[73:31.81]Take it.
[73:32.53]Take it somewhere else.
[73:34.23]Take it somewhere else.
[73:46.78]Okay, I just need one of these.
[73:48.20]Let's go.
[73:48.52]Let's leap.
[73:52.46]Get for it.
[73:53.18]Let's get for it.
[73:53.98]I don't know what that means.
[73:55.22]Let's go for it and get it.
[74:05.57]He can't ban us all.
[74:06.93]No, yes I can.
[74:09.59]With just a simple snap of my fingers, you guys would just be fucking gone.
[74:31.28]No more Fortnite.
[74:32.21]Yeah, I'm going to take away your Fortnite privileges.
[74:35.43]You want to keep this up?
[74:36.33]No more Fortnite.
[74:45.95]You're only going to get to play educational games, not Fortnite.
[74:58.44]Alright, we're gonna go up, left, straight.
[75:05.24]Fortnite is educational.
[75:13.75]I want these slimes.
[75:21.71]Is he gold?
[75:24.21]No?
[75:28.21]No.
[75:32.22]I just want the slimes.
[75:33.22]That's all I want.
[75:33.96]Can we still play Super Frog?
[75:37.36]Of course you can play Super Frog.
[75:39.48]I almost just died.
[75:40.18]I didn't have any energy left.
[75:42.21]Yeah, you can play Super Frog.
[75:43.31]That's completely fine.
[75:44.31]Absolutely.
[75:47.45]Super Frog teaches you skills.
[75:51.13]It teaches you about... Oh my goodness.
[75:54.63]I should probably help him.
[76:03.06]Although you're right, it does got candy.
[76:05.56]It does have candy.
[76:06.64]Hmm.
[76:08.70]It teaches you educational number counting, but it does have candy in it.
[76:14.72]Everyone good?
[76:15.64]Good.
[76:25.60]How could you not like it?
[76:26.79]Yeah, but candy is not good for your teeth.
[76:35.75]Hey.
[76:37.83]What the heck's going on with this?
[76:40.91]How come there's no video game where you actually use the analog stick to brush your teeth?
[76:49.84]There's no brushing teeth in video games.
[76:54.12]I've never played a video game where you brush your teeth with the controller.
[76:59.40]Why have they never done that?
[77:00.16]It seems kind of fun.
[77:06.64]No, I'm not talking about WarioWare.
[77:07.94]I'm talking about like a 3D game RPG or something.
[77:11.13]You go and you spit.
[77:12.43]You swish, swish, swish, swish, spit.
[77:17.11]Use the actual analog stick to brush.
[77:32.44]You can do that in heavy rain?
[77:34.30]Hmm.
[77:34.46]Might have to play it.
[77:43.23]It'd be fun one time.
[77:44.27]No, you could do like a Red Dead Redemption thing with it.
[77:47.39]Where if you just didn't brush your teeth, they turn like brown or something or like gray.
[77:54.01]Like over time, you don't like clean.
[77:55.54]You just have these like gray brown teeth, like yellow teeth.
[78:08.07]Alright, we're finally going to open this door.
[78:09.33]Let's see what happens.
[78:14.17]That's it.
[78:16.89]Now, um...
[78:40.83]Into the past, all that is lost is eventually found and lost once more.
[78:46.95]Okay, any new slimes?
[78:49.77]What's this thing?
[78:50.41]I don't know if I- should I press this?
[78:56.01]What is all this?
[79:02.66]Where am I on the map?
[79:03.96]Oh.
[79:05.92]Press it, press it.
[79:07.04]Hold on.
[79:20.41]Okay.
[79:25.07]I can open doors.
[79:29.17]We're going further into the temple.
[79:30.47]There's these weird hologram things all over the place.
[79:37.66]Excuse me.
[79:42.75]New slime.
[79:44.27]Give us a new slime.
[79:45.79]Give us a new slime.
[79:46.79]Give us it.
[79:47.65]Give us it.
[79:48.05]We want it.
[79:52.09]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[79:55.00]Quantum slime.
[79:59.82]Quantum slime.
[80:02.08]Hurry, get as many as I can.
[80:12.63]Quantum Crystal is the new play.
[80:26.70]Cool.
[80:27.92]What do quantums eat?
[80:38.74]Ooh.
[80:40.20]I'm going this way.
[80:41.92]Like, ooh.
[80:45.38]Ooh, this is going to freak me out.
[80:46.67]Alright, how about down here?
[80:48.37]What is over here?
[80:48.83]Anything?
[80:52.47]Read my lips.
[80:58.11]What about this tree?
[81:00.15]Oh, can I open it?
[81:01.57]Nice.
[81:02.20]Something valuable.
[81:03.16]Come on.
[81:03.82]I deserve it.
[81:05.54]A sunburst tree.
[81:09.03]Let's try to get a good like 10, 20, 20 quantum slimes.
[81:39.09]I'll take the puddles.
[81:40.89]You know I like them.
[81:41.63]Ooh, what's this?
[81:50.02]A red echo?
[81:50.92]Ooh, red echo.
[81:55.20]How far into the game are you?
[82:04.69]Um, I believe this is the final area.
[82:08.05]So I've unlocked all the areas.
[82:09.35]I don't know exactly how much is left, but I mean, enough for me to like, just mess around and sell things and buy things.
[82:14.37]There's another one.
[82:19.07]Ooh.
[82:22.09]Pink echoes.
[82:30.52]I need that device that shows you the map.
[82:33.64]Whoa.
[82:34.00]This is like, this is quantum fruit.
[82:35.78]How do I turn this on?
[82:38.62]Look, this is like a quantum fruit tree.
[82:41.78]How do I get that to work?
[82:43.40]They probably eat these.
[82:44.70]They eat fruit.
[82:45.30]Okay.
[82:52.17]Hit it with a fruit.
[82:54.51]Wait, what?
[83:09.63]Whoa.
[83:11.19]A phase lemon.
[83:15.03]Holy shit.
[83:15.89]Okay, that's definitely their favorite food.
[83:18.51]There's no way a phase lemon's not a quantum slime's favorite food.
[83:22.77]Oh, I gotta go back.
[83:24.41]I gotta get out of here.
[83:26.05]I gotta go.
[83:34.57]Is there another slime to get here?
[83:36.30]Hold on.
[83:41.51]Come here.
[83:44.25]And there's another treasure trove there.
[83:49.27]Can't open it though.
[83:52.25]Lava.
[83:57.20]Oh.
[83:58.16]Can I?
[83:59.48]I'm gonna get it.
[83:59.88]There's a treasure pod.
[84:01.44]Oh, I don't have any room.
[84:02.52]No!
[84:03.38]What do I do?
[84:04.40]Oh, shit.
[84:04.90]I don't want to open this.
[84:05.52]What if it's good?
[84:12.42]I don't want to... Get rid of the puddles.
[84:22.97]Is it good?
[84:25.99]Okay, we're fine.
[84:27.18]Urgent grass patch.
[84:32.56]I want at least 20 slime before I go anywhere.
[84:45.07]I want 20 of the slimes.
[84:46.67]I want 20 of them.
[84:48.33]We have to do a lot of slime combination here.
[84:51.01]How do I get out of here?
[84:56.57]We have 21.
[84:57.13]You don't need the echo.
[85:02.50]I don't?
[85:02.70]What do you mean?
[85:06.40]Where's the among us?
[85:07.50]9 plus 10 is 21.
[85:09.50]Quantum slime?
[85:13.44]Echo is a decoration.
[85:17.05]Echo is a cosmetic decoration.
[85:22.09]That's a lie.
[85:30.50]That's a lie.
[85:31.20]That's definitely a lie.
[85:32.60]You want me to shoot it into the ocean so you can write Omega Law, like a hundred of you.
[85:39.14]Ooh, wait a minute.
[85:39.58]What's this?
[86:05.11]What do they love?
[86:07.62]Fae's lemons are their favorite.
[86:09.12]I gotta grow Fae's lemons.
[86:10.32]Feed him an echo.
[86:12.18]Alright, I know where that is now, but I need to feed him a fruit so he shows up on the map.
[86:19.25]Anything, really.
[86:21.15]This is like... Okay, no, no, I know where he is.
[86:24.35]Up in like the weird lake up here.
[86:25.47]Okay.
[86:25.69]I don't even remember how to get out of here.
[86:36.85]You have a phase lemon.
[86:37.70]I'm not shooting that.
[86:38.30]I want to grow these.
[86:44.90]I need to see what that lava is, though.
[86:54.07]Right?
[86:54.33]We got to go over there.
[87:06.19]I need to see what this is.
[87:06.87]Or we'll get out of the way.
[87:11.43]What's the lava?
[87:14.64]It's a lava slime.
[87:15.86]That's a boom gordo.
[87:16.78]He eats meat.
[87:23.23]Oh, wait, wait.
[87:23.67]I want to be able to mark this.
[87:42.25]Can't, like, bounce it off the wall.
[87:45.17]Go around, idiot.
[87:47.25]Can I?
[87:47.65]I mean, we need to go around.
[87:48.87]Can I?
[87:57.83]Just go around.
[87:58.73]Go... Where's the button to press this?
[88:02.97]I need to open that door.
[88:23.76]Through the door.
[88:26.77]What door?
[88:29.23]Fly over the wall.
[88:30.07]Hold on.
[88:35.83]Grab more quantums.
[88:41.11]Every time I see him, I'm trying to pick him up.
[88:45.36]Aha!
[88:45.52]Yes!
[88:47.48]I'm out.
[88:54.09]Thank goodness.
[88:56.17]Ooh.
[88:57.89]There's the teleporter.
[89:06.70]Alright.
[89:07.06]Now.
[89:12.12]I don't know what I did.
[89:13.10]Alright.
[89:13.34]I got to.
[89:14.76]Where's that Gordo?
[89:15.72]He's over here.
[89:19.13]Where is he?
[89:20.91]He's in here, right?
[89:23.43]He's right there, so can I go around here?
[89:28.86]Like, where do I go?
[89:29.52]Let's see.
[89:32.38]He's in there.
[89:36.32]The door is open.
[89:37.80]What do you mean the door is open?
[89:44.71]Door is open.
[89:45.47]Door.
[89:46.31]The door is open.
[89:48.30]Oh, the door!
[89:49.16]The door!
[89:50.42]The door's open!
[90:06.78]Now he's marked.
[90:12.04]Now I know where he is.
[90:20.78]Thank you.
[90:22.38]The other guy's like right here.
[90:26.34]The door's cosmetic.
[90:27.30]It is not cosmetic.
[90:30.22]Alright, I'll actually get me out of here and I'm going to do some quantum slime computing.
[90:37.94]You guys know that the quantum computing stuff?
[90:39.60]You guys hear about that?
[90:49.67]Isn't the whole scary thing with quantum computing that it can, like, crack your password in, like, three seconds?
[90:55.20]Can't a quantum computer crack any password in, like, less than a day or something?
[91:01.20]What are we going to do?
[91:07.32]Pick him up.
[91:07.84]What the fuck?
[91:10.17]We're going to cry.
[91:16.53]No, not even close.
[91:19.88]What do you mean not even close?
[91:26.82]Quantum computing also allows for ultimate privacy.
[91:31.46]Well, I don't have a quantum computer.
[91:33.88]I'm not going to be able to have one when they first come out.
[91:36.16]The person with the first quantum computer is going to get everybody's password.
[91:41.05]I got 27 quantum slimes.
[91:53.94]is there does it I gotta get that teleporter alright alright right right let's make this happen quantum quantum computing has been around since before you were born Jeremy yeah but just because this one in some random NASA warehouse when we all have one when it fits inside of your hand like a smartphone
[92:31.56]It's not how it works.
[92:34.03]Yeah, and guess what?
[92:36.19]40, 50 years ago, we didn't think that we'd be able to send our voices through the air to each other.
[92:41.88]That's fucked up, isn't it?
[92:51.26]Radio No, you know, I hold on a minute.
[92:54.16]We're not talking about radio We're talking about I can I can through the air To satellite to satellite call you if you're in Tokyo and I'm in Vegas and we can have a clear perfectly normal conversation I'm not talking about like Hey, hold on Oh
[93:21.83]Yeah, and they're like 200 feet away from each other.
[93:32.01]Yeah, telephone goes through wires.
[93:33.18]What do you mean the telephone?
[93:37.28]Yeah, the telephone went through a wire into the wall, through into the ground.
[93:40.66]It's an overgrowing fruit.
[93:49.52]The internet is wires.
[93:52.95]Not wireless internet.
[93:57.36]That sounded like I was Elvis.
[94:01.22]Oh, look at all these puddles lives.
[94:02.56]We're going to put it here.
[94:10.88]Mobile phones eventually go to wires.
[94:14.41]I don't even know that.
[94:16.01]Yay.
[94:16.23]Okay.
[94:17.21]I took a networking class in college.
[94:19.89]I took networking one.
[94:22.58]I learned how to crimp a Ethernet cable.
[94:24.92]So, okay.
[94:27.98]Okay, so what you know, right?
[94:29.14]That was in like 1989.
[94:45.93]Look at all these cute little plorts.
[94:48.65]Networking Andy.
[94:52.17]Shit, I don't have any more crystals because I turn them into rad crystals.
[94:55.47]Well looks like we're getting rid of some shit What are we getting rid of oh?
[94:59.81]I know we're getting rid of out here Want does quantum need something special?
[95:06.08]Because it is time to get rid of the cats didn't I get rid of the cats already Why are they still here wait what happened?
[95:13.98]I thought I got rid of these already I Made a new plot.
[95:18.76]That's right.
[95:19.14]That's right.
[95:19.46]That's right.
[95:19.76]That's right.
[95:20.04]I know where it is.
[95:20.48]Oh
[95:22.43]Are they gonna phase out of existence?
[95:28.52]If I put them in here, are they gonna disappear?
[95:35.61]Let me read.
[95:38.34]Quantum.
[95:39.24]Quantum slimes appear to have resulted from some sort of event that took place in the ancient ruins long ago.
[95:45.74]Yep.
[95:47.00]At all times, the quantum slime is capable of emitting other possible realities of their being, called ghosts.
[95:53.52]These other realities can come true with the quantum slime aligning with the reality of the ghost, effectively teleporting.
[96:01.90]Hmm.
[96:02.10]So, I have to keep them fed.
[96:31.20]These guys gotta be kept fed or they will just disappear.
[96:34.94]At all times.
[96:36.72]Read Puddle Slime.
[96:39.96]Puddle slimes aren't risky to manage they just require a fair bit of maintenance.
[96:43.00]A rancher needs a pool of fresh water like a pond available for a puddle slime and its plorts to sit in as they will evaporate if they're away from water.
[96:51.00]Finally puddle slimes are exceptionally shy and will not produce plorts if they're in close proximity to more than three others.
[96:54.00]Oh, oops.
[96:56.00]Overall pulse time is bare for- yeah I'm just sleepy. Okay. So I have to- I can only have four.
[97:02.00]Oh shit no no no no no no come back here. I don't want you to teleport out of reality.
[97:07.73]Alright, I gotta hold on to the quantum slimes for a little bit.
[97:14.39]What was that?
[97:14.77]I need to plant a garden.
[97:23.50]We are replacing mint fruit with phase lemon.
[97:31.59]In fact, we are going to do two phase lemon gardens, folks.
[97:50.94]This is right here.
[97:51.80]They're right over there.
[97:52.66]Why is that a bad idea?
[97:58.79]They're right here.
[98:00.93]What's wrong with my brain?
[98:01.95]I want a ton of production of that fruit.
[98:06.82]I want to be able to constantly keep an auto feeder going on that thing.
[98:17.91]Mint fruit gang rebel.
[98:23.17]Keep mint mangoes.
[98:26.15]Please read about echoes.
[98:46.54]Let's get rid of the cats already.
[98:49.94]Um, okay, hold on.
[98:50.70]Let me... These guys eat fruit.
[98:55.74]So, I mean, I could... Here's what we're going to do.
[99:02.07]Stop it!
[99:02.67]Quiet!
[99:07.15]They eat fruit.
[99:11.83]I'm going to just load this up.
[99:12.93]We're going to put the quantum slimes in here and start production.
[99:22.14]They eat fruit.
[99:29.43]So I can fill that up.
[99:31.21]They'll be eating.
[99:31.85]Here we go.
[99:39.80]Plenty of food.
[99:41.60]Let's go.
[99:43.48]Way too many.
[99:44.06]You're going to be in trouble.
[99:46.81]Why are they flying?
[99:47.55]Why are they floating away?
[99:49.39]Why are they floating away?
[99:50.81]Get him.
[99:51.09]Get him.
[99:51.37]Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Gimmie. Gimmie. Gimmie. Gimmie.
[100:01.02]Why are they flying away?
[100:03.74]Feed them.
[100:04.38]I was feeding them.
[100:12.19]It's fake.
[100:13.85]What?
[100:17.21]Oh wait, I have 27 still.
[100:18.28]Alright, feed.
[100:34.95]Feed them before they all leave.
[100:36.15]Hurry up and feed them with the auto-feeder.
[100:40.67]Feed them!
[100:42.10]Why is it...
[100:43.46]I'll do it.
[100:53.15]These things are freaking me out, they really are.
[100:54.62]They're just spreading out everywhere.
[101:02.06]Alright, I got gold plorts.
[101:04.49]I got quantum plorts, hell yeah.
[101:10.01]Let's keep feeding gold plorts.
[101:14.46]Now I'm going to do... I need crystals.
[101:16.56]Or maybe another one.
[101:17.30]Maybe I'll save it.
[101:19.86]Water them.
[101:26.80]Water quick.
[101:27.44]Water quick.
[101:28.42]Do I have to do this?
[101:32.36]Save.
[101:33.30]How often do I have to do that?
[101:42.37]You don't need to do that if you keep them fed.
[101:43.99]Okay.
[101:45.03]That's what we're going to do.
[101:48.03]Alright.
[101:48.43]So I got, I got, alright.
[101:50.53]I got to keep that filled.
[101:52.77]I got to keep that filled up.
[101:53.45]I'm going to go stuff it in there.
[101:55.49]Wow.
[101:57.20]This game is like, seriously, can we give like the, how do we get the developers of this game?
[102:01.86]Like a hundred million dollars to like make more stuff like this.
[102:19.50]Okay.
[102:22.26]Looks good.
[102:22.86]How much do these sell for?
[102:25.24]That's what I want to know.
[102:26.48]I'm very interested in this.
[102:30.32]Alright, let's go back for a sec.
[102:31.40]I want to see what the quantum plorts sell for.
[102:34.44]And then I'm going to get crystal plorts.
[102:36.96]I'm going to make... Maybe not.
[102:39.22]Am I missing the slime that's in there?
[102:40.34]118. 118.
[102:47.30]Is there another... Is there a new thing I can get?
[102:50.79]I have so much money.
[102:56.51]You never read what the Echoes do.
[103:06.72]That's cool.
[103:07.77]I'm kidding.
[103:08.33]Relax.
[103:11.77]Within the crumbling walls of the ancient ruins, small traces of energy can be found, never staying in one place for very long, called echoes.
[103:20.60]They are believed to be a phenomenon resulting from some kind of ancient event.
[103:24.56]Since they are harmless, echoes are often collected by ranchers as good luck charms or used as decorations.
[103:30.09]Echoes appear regularly in the nooks and crannies of the ancient ruins, as well as from extractors.
[103:35.33]Echoes can be used as decorations.
[103:37.03]Simply vac them up and shoot them anywhere you want.
[103:39.55]They'll hover in that spot until you vac them up.
[103:57.73]Cool.
[104:01.49]Oh, puddle plorts.
[104:02.19]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[104:06.52]Do I sell these or hold on to them?
[104:09.64]Maybe I'll sell... No.
[104:12.58]Sell... 7.
[104:13.58]Sell... More.
[104:20.51]More.
[104:22.41]More.
[104:22.63]I just need 1.
[104:23.69]2.
[104:23.75]I need 1.
[104:29.99]I gotta go get another... Okay, is there another slime in that area where I just was?
[104:33.76]There's like a lava slime or something, right?
[104:38.82]You have sugar hands.
[104:40.04]You guys all fed?
[104:48.59]Sugar hands.
[104:53.29]There are more areas.
[104:54.13]Ooh, okay.
[104:55.75]Alright, now this is what we're gonna do.
[104:57.85]I'm gonna bring a shitload of meat and a shitload of fruit.
[105:03.05]What was the... Where are... What were they?
[105:05.67]It was this guy, which is meat.
[105:07.31]And then there's this guy, which was fruit.
[105:10.77]He loves these things.
[105:12.37]I'm gonna... I'm gonna bring these.
[105:18.52]And I need 15 of these, right?
[105:27.08]There it is.
[105:27.94]I can now feed that guy.
[105:28.94]25.
[105:28.96]Shit.
[105:29.20]Okay.
[105:29.80]It said upgrade the 7 Z rewards.
[105:38.28]Oh yeah, I have a lot of money.

[106:35.21]Guardian.
[106:36.47]I think I'll build... This will show up better, I think.
[106:38.53]I think I'll recognize that more.
[106:41.68]It'll be like, whoa, it's got like red and green and it's got the huge... Okay, yeah.
[106:46.92]Definitely that one.
[106:50.70]Ice Cream Cat, yeah.
[107:01.71]Alright.
[107:03.13]Hi, guys.
[107:05.87]Hello.
[107:08.05]Need to bring a lot of fruit.
[107:11.45]No, I don't.
[107:13.09]What is the boom slime's favorite food?
[107:17.74]Briar hens.
[107:20.98]Okay.
[107:23.24]How many briar hens do I have?
[107:24.38]Because I'm bringing a shitload.
[107:29.71]I need to keep one of these in case I need to grow them.
[107:33.31]Gold.
[107:39.33]Oh, no, no.
[107:39.67]That was an awful joke.
[107:43.24]What joke?
[107:43.60]I made a joke?
[107:45.64]What joke did I make?
[107:47.22]I wasn't aware of a joke.
[107:48.00]What are you talking about?
[107:48.66]What joke?
[107:55.36]Joke.
[107:58.25]You said among us.
[107:59.87]I didn't.
[108:02.31]What's going on?
[108:04.66]You didn't... I don't even know what I did.
[108:07.28]You didn't change them.
[108:08.08]I didn't?
[108:08.36]I have briar hens.
[108:14.64]I have a lot of stony hens.
[108:15.62]This is unfortunate.
[108:25.34]Briar.
[108:25.68]There we are.
[108:26.38]Briar hen.
[108:28.10]Briar hen.
[108:30.24]Briar hen.
[108:31.06]Come here.
[108:36.87]Take all the briar hens.
[108:39.43]We need to do this.
[108:40.81]Sorry.
[108:41.13]I'm going to wipe out the entire population.
[108:49.40]Okay.
[108:50.20]So I need 25 hens, right?
[108:54.10]So therefore I need 10.
[108:55.46]I'm trying to calculate this.
[108:58.86]How much are the roosters worth?
[109:03.99]Roosters are worth more, right?
[109:05.11]What do I need?
[109:14.01]Are the roosters not worth more?
[109:16.89]They aren't.
[109:18.39]Well, I could do with some clearing out here.
[109:19.95]Alright.
[109:20.43]Stony hen it is.
[109:21.67]No, regular hens.
[109:22.49]There's a lot of them running around.
[109:26.69]You only need like two roosters per coop.
[109:29.61]Alright.
[109:30.35]Let's fucking get rid of them.
[109:38.63]Alright.
[109:38.95]How are you guys doing?
[109:41.31]Fed?
[109:41.49]Are you well fed?
[109:44.68]We have plenty of food over here.
[109:56.06]So I need 17, right?
[109:57.74]Somebody said 17 regular hens.
[110:25.08]Okay.
[110:26.80]Is that right?
[110:32.51]17, 8.
[110:32.87]That's enough, right?
[110:37.77]One escaped.
[110:38.41]What?
[110:41.05]Who?
[110:46.61]Who escaped?
[110:47.11]What are you talking about?
[110:51.50]Who escaped?
[110:54.65]Somebody escaped?
[111:00.45]Is that real?
[111:02.83]That's real.
[111:03.55]What?
[111:03.75]How are they getting out?
[111:05.07]Isn't there a net?
[111:16.04]No, I want... How did they get out?
[111:18.70]How did they...
[111:25.52]I don't know how you guys get out, but whatever.
[111:26.82]They teleported out, but why?
[111:31.43]They're well fed.
[111:32.71]You need to water them.
[111:49.22]31.
[111:49.32]Alright.
[111:49.90]I'm going to do those.
[111:51.32]Wait.
[111:56.02]Whatever.
[111:58.34]Come on.
[111:58.60]Hurry up.
[111:58.90]I need these.
[112:06.36]Get away from that.
[112:26.12]Get in there.
[112:29.96]Get in there.
[112:34.97]Oh, whatever.
[112:35.75]He just eats fruit.
[112:36.51]I don't care.
[112:36.91]I need this fruit to hurry up.
[112:47.32]I'm getting rid of the roosters.
[112:48.76]So I can bring more fruit.
[112:49.82]Yeah, fuck this.
[112:53.82]I'll get more red hens on the way there.
[113:06.36]Yeah, I mean, come on.
[113:10.03]Now I can bring a shitload of fruit.
[113:12.03]Yeah, I'll bring a full stack of cuberts.
[113:19.31]So let me open up both of those big guys.
[113:23.86]Alright, I'm ready.
[113:27.34]I'm ready.
[113:28.38]Let's go.
[113:30.04]I need to go this way to the quantum computer realm.
[113:34.33]You go up here.
[113:37.91]I'm trying to remember where all this... Whoa, hello.
[113:39.97]What the hell?
[113:40.69]I just got, like, electrocuted.
[113:42.25]Like, I'm... Oh, I'm okay.
[113:43.99]I'm fine.
[113:46.53]This way.
[113:57.94]Shit, there's so many.
[113:59.68]How do I make one of those drones?
[114:01.14]Okay.
[114:02.44]I need a drone now.
[114:04.92]Drone.
[114:07.16]12 quantum plorts.
[114:08.04]I can make one right now.
[114:09.50]Yep, I'm making a drone.
[114:26.97]Watch out for the explosions!
[114:32.18]You know what?
[114:34.46]It's time to do this too.
[114:37.11]It's like rotting.
[114:39.09]Alright, we're doing... Everybody, just stay still.
[114:47.17]Give me a second.
[114:47.75]Hold on.
[114:53.15]Hold on.
[114:55.27]I'm making this... I'm making this a phase 11 place.
[114:59.11]Well, not this one.
[114:59.79]Maybe the other one.
[115:01.48]This is too much.
[115:02.72]It's way too much of this bullshit.
[115:05.62]Yeah.
[115:07.50]I'm not doing that anymore.
[115:09.64]I'm making one of these a phase lemon.
[115:10.66]The one back here at the lab.
[115:11.38]Have you ever thought about going cold turkey?
[115:18.94]What am I cold turkeying?
[115:24.87]Oh my goodness.
[115:26.45]Alright, just hold on.
[115:28.28]Just feed the fuck out of everything.
[115:30.58]Feed.
[115:31.28]Feed the fuck out of everything.
[115:32.36]Oh, these Oka-Okas.
[115:33.12]I have too much Oka-Oka supply.
[115:35.76]Way too much Oka-Oka supply right now.
[115:37.82]And way too... I have a full stack of hundreds.
[115:42.29]I need to... Oh boy.
[115:43.53]Okay.
[115:44.35]What do I do here?
[115:45.93]Oh boy.
[115:46.85]Okay.
[115:48.01]We gotta...
[115:52.56]What the fuck happened to them?
[115:53.60]Oh, they turned... Okay.
[115:55.12]I need a auto-feeder.
[115:59.74]Okay, I need to just dump the Oka-Oka in here.
[116:04.09]What was that?
[116:05.41]Oh.
[116:10.99]Put it on slow feeding.
[116:15.60]Suck all the... Ugh.
[116:18.70]All these out.
[116:27.49]Okay, sell this.
[116:41.91]Sell the rad plorts.
[116:45.92]Do it again.
[116:46.28]We're going to crash the market.
[116:48.52]That's fine.
[116:49.90]I have to get rid of these.
[116:50.58]I have so many.
[117:05.11]I can't even pick it up.
[117:06.13]Does birds lead them?
[117:06.80]I don't even care.
[117:37.82]It's overflowing.
[117:39.72]It's overflowing.
[117:41.08]These motherfuckers are overflowing right now.
[117:44.02]I just, I jump.
[118:07.55]I'll be right back.
[118:09.49]I just have to do this two more times.
[118:19.11]Oh my god, there's so many in there.
[118:20.59]Alright, I have to delete some of these guys.
[118:23.89]It's time to get rid of some of these.
[118:33.04]Fuck!
[119:02.13]It's just Mario running up the stairs to Bowser's big star level.
[119:09.12]But a little bit faster.
[119:10.08]Hold on.
[119:12.44]I need to go a little closer.
[119:25.38]Alright, that's enough.
[119:27.12]Remember how badly I wanted these before?
[119:29.27]I was like, oh man, I wish I had some more plorts.
[119:32.21]Oh, where the fuck?
[119:33.55]Whatever, they're going to eat those.
[119:36.70]It's fine.
[119:39.90]Thank God I have too many.
[119:43.46]44 crystals.
[119:43.92]I'm going to leave those.
[119:44.61]I don't need them right now.
[119:50.24]He's stuck in a loop.
[119:51.14]I really am, but it's a very, very expensive loop for them to pay me.
[119:55.66]I'm at $23,000 right now.
[119:59.04]I have Mario running up the stairs.
[120:09.33]Kind of.
[120:09.65]Alright.
[120:17.31]Now, just scoop him up.
[120:19.47]Might as well.
[120:22.61]Okay, I'm going to get the last of the Okaokas on the other farm, replace it with a phase lemon, and then be done with it.
[120:32.95]I'll be done with it.
[120:48.02]Job never ends.
[120:48.96]No, it doesn't, does it?
[120:54.77]It's constant.
[120:55.99]I need one of those buzzy bees right now.
[120:58.97]Okay.
[120:59.27]Wait.
[120:59.49]I need rad, don't I?
[121:00.67]How much did I need?
[121:01.29]How much rad do I need?
[121:02.15]I just sold all of it.
[121:03.73]How much do I need for the bee?
[121:04.61]Alright.
[121:08.32]We're taking a full stack to the bee.
[121:09.34]Alright.
[121:27.25]Okay.
[121:27.95]Now, I'm gonna go back to the lab.
[121:33.87]We're gonna suck up... Um... Okay.
[121:38.71]Deposit plorts, suck up remaining oka-okas, turn that into a phased lemon crop.
[121:42.33]Center.
[121:42.55]Okay.
[121:52.83]Okay.
[121:53.65]What do I need?
[121:55.71]Utility.
[121:56.29]Drone.
[121:58.46]Where the fuck do I get wild honey?
[122:03.02]Oh, God.
[122:03.50]I can't even do this.
[122:04.82]Click change style to actually change the style.
[122:11.40]Keep upgrading the 7Z rewards.
[122:13.42]Do you not see the cats already?
[122:15.32]They changed back.
[122:16.22]They changed to the honey.
[122:17.48]Or did it?
[122:19.20]Think you can debate me right now?
[122:20.22]I just saw the change in real time in the game world.
[122:22.86]What do you think I am?
[122:28.28]Alright.
[122:30.31]Kill this crop.
[122:32.35]Remove crops.
[122:33.05]Bay's lemon.
[122:34.81]Let's go.
[122:36.03]More lemons.
[122:38.69]Oka oka.
[122:44.72]deposit oka oka into oka oka depository oka oka has been deposited oka oka deposit is complete oka oka is ready to be harvested oka oka is now in your inventory okay we're done
[123:14.59]See, look.
[123:16.25]It changed.
[123:16.75]These were Cheshires before.
[123:18.07]And they didn't have the honey thing on their head.
[123:30.65]Oh, each one of these is hiding from the other one.
[123:34.64]They're all hiding from each other.
[123:41.60]Quantums are all gone.
[123:42.52]They better not be.
[123:45.94]I'll be very upset with you.
[123:55.44]Okay.
[123:57.24]We'll check on the quantums.
[124:02.86]Drop the chickens?
[124:04.14]I'm about to go feed the chickens.
[124:07.79]They're not all gone.
[124:08.63]They're here.
[124:13.85]Oh, bingo.
[124:27.22]That was actually a real one.
[124:33.17]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[124:34.61]Bay's lemons, ready for harvest.
[124:44.08]This'll be enough.
[124:54.54]That's enough.
[124:55.16]Alright, I've got enough to feed that guy.
[124:57.16]Completely.
[124:57.66]Alright, I need... I got the hens now.
[125:05.07]21 hens.
[125:06.31]What did I need?

[144:11.89]Alright, I don't want to get... I'm stuck in the loop again.
[144:14.21]Where I'm just running back and forth feeding vegetables to these things.
[144:17.25]When I should be going and feeding the big guy.
[144:20.22]And now I'm going to get stuck in a fucking loop again.
[144:22.04]Where...
[144:29.49]And then I'm going to jump into the lake again.
[144:31.85]Into the water.

[144:37.63]Don't even... Who cares?
[144:38.43]Don't collect them.
[144:39.55]Do not do that.
[144:41.25]This is going to be very enticing.
[144:42.35]I know.
[144:42.61]It looks really... I hate these things.
[144:44.45]Holy shit.
[144:46.39]There's 94 of these.
[144:48.40]Okay.
[144:48.68]I have to do this.

[145:41.49]I'll take care of it.
[145:42.15]Let's go.
[145:43.29]Hens.
[145:43.61]Hens.
[145:43.87]Hens.
[145:44.17]Hens.
[145:44.45]Hens.
[145:44.73]Hens.

[145:57.03]Okay, whatever.
[145:59.57]I'll fill it back up.

[146:01.47]Let's go.
[146:01.81]I'm leaving.
[146:02.65]No, I'm not.
[146:03.03]Here, just take these.
[146:03.75]Okay, good.
[146:11.02]Okay.
[146:33.35]Okay, I need to take two back.
[146:35.31]And collect red hens.
[146:36.39]And if I fall, I swear to God, if I fall into the goddamn ocean, I am going to... I don't know.
[146:44.45]I'm going to be very upset about it, though.
[146:45.75]I'm going to be very, very mad about it.
[146:54.87]Come here.
[146:56.63]Where'd he go?
[146:57.89]He phased out.
[146:59.13]Dick.
[147:00.82]Alright, red hens.
[147:02.70]Yes, hello, hello, yes.
[147:04.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[147:07.38]How many do I need?
[147:07.92]A lot.
[147:21.68]More.
[147:24.30]Okay, I should be able to get there just by walking around and picking up hens.
[147:27.19]Let's move.
[147:29.79]This is the wrong way.
[147:37.38]Alright, we can relax now.
[147:38.48]I can settle down.
[147:39.16]Let me just chill for a sec.
[147:43.05]Alright.
[147:45.11]This last red hen over here.
[147:46.49]This one and this one.
[147:50.59]Do not, under any circumstances, fall in the goddamn water.
[147:52.82]Okay, I'm going to take a few deep breaths and we're going to be fine.
[147:56.94]Okay.
[148:00.84]Okay.
[148:02.48]There we go.
[148:04.52]Back to what we were doing.
[148:07.31]Everything is good.
[148:08.45]There's no issues at all.
[148:10.56]Follow me.
[148:15.48]I should probably pee.
[148:16.16]Should I pee?
[148:19.94]Is it time to pee?
[148:23.19]Might be.
[148:30.27]No.
[148:30.63]No peeing until I do this.
[148:38.04]I will pee when I'm done.
[148:38.90]Let's try this again.
[148:43.58]This is a Majora's Mask thing or something, by the way.
[148:49.94]Do I only have like a few days?
[148:50.86]How many days do I have to do this?
[148:54.08]This way.
[149:05.89]I have seven more days to do this?
[149:08.89]Wait, what do you mean?
[149:09.47]Is there... How do I get up there?
[149:20.30]Oh, I have to go this way.
[149:27.56]Okay, go.
[149:30.07]Just collect chickens on the way there.
[149:32.05]And I'm going to feed those two guys.
[149:34.87]One likes meat.
[149:35.77]One likes hens.
[149:37.72]I'll take another hen.
[149:38.56]Thank you.
[149:40.62]Scream if you see a briar hen.
[149:44.08]Scream as loud as you can.
[149:45.46]Okay.
[149:58.75]This way.
[150:01.89]Don't jump into the water.
[150:04.11]I almost did.
[150:04.57]That was very close.
[150:14.10]I had zero.
[150:14.90]Oh, that would have been very bad.
[150:17.84]I would have freaked the fuck out.
[150:20.34]We're good.
[150:21.78]A lot of hens up here.
[150:22.44]Ooh, that's good.
[150:24.64]Good, good, good, good, good.
[150:25.40]I think I have enough.

[156:17.63]Alright, let's feed this other guy.
[156:20.57]I have to pee so bad.
[156:23.07]Nice, got the key.
[156:27.15]I can't believe I made it three hours without peeing.
[156:34.06]It seems kind of bizarre.
[156:38.04]Usually I pee every like hour and 25 minutes on the dot.
[156:50.44]Can I float over here?
[156:56.14]Uh-huh.
[156:56.78]Here we go.
[157:03.91]Shit, why is this closed now?
[157:17.12]Shit, where's the thing to open that?
[157:21.61]Oh no, where is it?
[157:23.57]Where's the thing to press the button to open that?
[157:25.19]Is it this one?
[157:35.22]Okay, yeah.
[157:53.64]Oh, hold on.
[157:54.44]I'm not peeing yet.

[158:10.62]What was that for?
[158:11.26]Is there a key?
[158:14.28]There's literally no key in there.
[158:21.27]I just used... Oh my god, it's right here.
[158:22.95]Okay, I was gonna say, I fed him like 40 chickens!
[158:27.23]I don't need these.
[158:27.81]I don't want the plort either.
[158:31.83]Wait!
[158:33.38]I wanna see what happens.
[158:38.56]Can you eat that?
[158:39.96]What do you turn into?
[158:40.54]A quantum bomb?
[158:43.00]Oh shit.
[158:44.50]It's gonna explode every fucking reality.
[158:49.74]I have two keys now.
[158:50.52]Okay, what's here?
[158:53.54]Where are the keys to?
[158:54.46]I feel like this is a spoiler.
[159:03.45]All the way up here?
[159:03.99]Go to the teleporter.
[159:09.94]Alright.
[159:17.37]Teleporter.
[159:18.19]Teleporter.
[159:19.19]Teleporter.
[159:19.75]Teleporter.
[159:20.23]Going up.
[159:20.87]Teleporter.
[159:21.27]Going up.
[159:21.91]Teleporter.
[159:22.89]Going up.
[159:23.91]Use that one.
[159:31.84]I got to press this button.
[159:41.46]It opened.
[159:42.12]It opened.
[159:54.21]How does one get up there?
[160:26.38]Open mouth Andy again.
[160:27.30]How do I get up there?
[160:43.56]I think maybe this way and go around.
[160:44.80]I don't know.
[160:55.56]Maybe I can just do it from here.
[160:56.50]I don't know.
[161:06.46]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[161:12.47]I'm going to go around this way.
[161:20.01]Then wrap that way.
[161:21.57]That door is just open though.
[161:22.69]Hold on.
[161:30.95]Sick.
[161:38.61]I know I have to pee, just wait.
[161:41.65]I'm busy.
[161:50.42]that leads us to here which is all the way up here open this go through this thing which leads me to here which leads me to here and then I turn this way which leads me to here which leads me to here I go over here that leads me to here and then I go up this way and lead me to here open that door and lead me to there I oh I get it okay wow
[162:32.15]And there's the door.
[162:32.75]And there's the teleporter.
[162:34.15]There it is.
[162:37.39]What is in this room?
[162:40.41]I don't know.
[162:41.82]Secret slime?
[162:43.48]I hope so.
[162:48.04]Monochrome.
[162:50.80]No.
[162:51.46]Nuh-uh.
[162:52.90]I don't think I'll use that one.
[162:56.55]Is the slime key?
[162:59.37]Is this a waste of time?
[163:00.19]Hopefully it's not.
[163:00.81]I'm just going to do it.
[163:14.76]Hmm.
[163:16.22]Spaceship?
[163:21.76]The ruins used to be some kind of warp station used by whoever created it to connect to one of the most distant corners of the far, far range.
[163:28.08]Be careful, Beatrix.
[163:30.14]Once you cross over, you'll be in truly untamed country.
[163:33.71]Though beautiful, the other side can be an unforgiving place.
[163:37.73]Oh.
[163:38.61]Okay.
[163:40.65]Alright, activate it.
[163:43.80]Oh, we got to fill with quantum, quantum plorts.
[163:48.42]Quantum, quantum, quantum, quantum, quantum.
[163:50.40]I'll be back.
[163:53.50]Okay.
[163:55.97]Oh my God, dude.
[163:57.59]What the, where the fuck am I right now?
[163:59.77]This is fucking terrifying.
[164:07.56]I have them?
[164:08.08]No, I don't.
[164:09.84]You already have enough.
[164:12.89]I thought it needed to be quantum plorts, not quantum slimes.
[164:23.46]Where does this take me?
[164:32.97]Just get some fruit and feed these ones.
[164:34.35]Yeah.
[164:36.13]That's right.
[164:42.29]I just need some fruit.
[164:52.53]Come on, Cheese!
[164:58.26]How many do I need? 10?
[165:16.07]Crunchies?
[165:18.07]Crunchies?
[165:20.63]Excuse me, Crunchies, where are they?
[165:24.82]Is this the Fruit Ninja guy?
[165:26.58]Yep, I hold every world record.
[165:29.26]I got to 5,000 points.
[165:47.11]Eat that.
[165:47.47]Yeah, can you believe it?
[165:49.73]I got to 5,000.
[165:50.47]Pog fruit, eat it.
[166:03.32]Use the teleporter?
[166:04.48]I'm already invested.
[166:13.99]Play Fruit Ninja.
[166:17.00]No, that would be really boring.
[166:27.11]I don't really necessarily even mean that for you.
[166:29.34]I mean that for me.
[166:36.40]Fruits.
[166:38.46]Forts.
[166:38.80]Here we go.
[166:42.33]Ooh, free.
[166:44.68]Six, seven, eight.
[166:45.30]Need two more.
[166:45.72]Two more plorts and I'm good.
[166:51.50]Is that enough?
[166:53.65]Oh, that's enough.
[166:54.07]I'm good.
[166:54.31]I have enough.
[167:02.11]Remember, you're only playing this game because you have a feeding frenzy.
[167:13.63]Root Ninja made you, dickhead.
[167:18.52]How do we turn it on?
[167:42.28]Smoke, fire, and mirrors.
[167:43.32]Glass desert.
[167:46.08]Ooh.
[167:47.30]This hurts my head.
[167:48.04]This is, okay, this is what I see when I wake up in the morning.
[167:58.05]Right when I open my eyes.
[167:59.69]And, or, you can replace it with this.
[168:02.35]Going into a dark room after being in the sun.
[168:05.57]That kind of change that your brain does and your eyes do.
[168:08.91]Adjusting to a dark room when you're coming in from brights.
[168:18.12]Holy shit.
[168:18.72]Butterscotch Warp Depot.
[168:20.02]This place is really cool.
[168:22.99]Definitely going to be new slimes here.
[168:24.43]I bet you there's new slimes here.
[168:29.63]Word that starts with letter G. I don't know what it is.
[168:32.77]Are there new fruits here?
[168:41.89]Saturn slime.
[168:42.97]Thank you.
[168:44.83]Dirtfish slime.
[168:55.66]What is that?
[168:57.56]I don't know what this thing is.
[168:58.42]What is this thing?
[169:02.99]What do I do with this?
[169:07.89]Gopi.
[169:08.53]Gopi.
[169:09.09]Gopi.
[169:09.37]I don't know what that is.
[169:10.11]Gopi.
[169:10.81]Gopi.
[169:11.63]Gopi.
[169:12.09]I don't know what that is.
[169:24.24]Shit, I gotta go pee.
[169:27.31]That's what you guys meant.
[169:30.45]I'm sorry.
[169:30.89]I'm fucking weird.
[169:31.73]I need to reverse aging.
[169:36.64]Is that movie?
[169:43.41]The guy reverses it going backwards.
[169:45.35]He ages the other way.
[169:46.09]Give it a plort.
[170:00.10]Oh, not click.
[170:00.98]Yeah, Benjamin Button.
[170:03.03]Click.
[170:10.93]Well, I can do Quantum Dervish.
[170:14.39]What's up here?
[170:14.81]There's a Chester Trust over there.
[170:26.04]Oh, that's where I came from.
[170:26.94]Never mind.
[170:27.24]I got turned around.
[170:32.01]Alright, pee time.
[170:33.07]We're back.
[170:34.51]Go pee if you need to.
[170:35.47]Go get a snack.
[170:36.15]Go refill your coffee.
[170:37.53]If you're drinking one or if you're drinking in water, have some more water.
[170:40.39]I'll be right back in about two minutes, three minutes.
[172:30.37]Thank you.
[174:45.14]Thanks for watching!
[175:41.99]Hello.
[175:42.17]Is that me on... Oh, Huel!
[175:50.34]Sick!
[175:50.88]I love Huel!
[175:54.68]If I had a Huel here right now, I'd go like this.
[176:05.88]Oh, cool.
[176:06.68]Look at this dude in the beach.
[176:13.83]Cool.
[176:16.30]Everybody loves fire, man.
[176:17.36]Come on.
[176:22.02]What's that one?
[176:28.08]Eating the hamburger.
[176:30.07]I see so many hamburger gifts.
[176:47.07]That's really good.
[176:47.89]Alright, let's move on.
[176:53.55]Let's go.
[176:54.45]We'll catch that one on the next break.
[176:58.15]The imposter is sus.
[177:03.99]Alright, I need to get more slimes.
[177:10.13]I want to go for at least five.
[177:14.15]They can multiply.
[177:14.90]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[177:16.94]I'm going all the way up.
[177:25.06]I see a big guy.
[177:30.84]Okay.
[177:33.40]Is this heat or something?
[177:34.38]Is it the standard of oxygen?
[177:35.48]I don't know what's going on.
[177:43.82]Is it too hot for me here?
[177:48.58]I have no idea.
[177:49.39]This looks like I'm suffocating.
[178:00.05]Who's throwing rocks?
[178:00.77]I'm gonna sneeze.
[178:03.71]Who is throwing rocks?
[178:05.96]Who's doing this?
[178:08.20]Hey.
[178:10.20]Who's doing that?
[178:10.80]Get out of here.
[178:15.28]Bowser's Fury?
[178:17.79]Oh, that's a slime.
[178:23.01]That's a new slime.
[178:23.61]That's a new slime.
[178:33.60]Fire slime.
[178:41.24]Shit.
[178:43.75]That is a turkey.
[178:45.17]What was that?
[178:46.05]It's dead, but I don't... It was a new... What the fuck is... What is all this stuff happening?
[178:51.85]Was it... Are these... What are those?
[178:54.90]I have this overwhelming... That was a new... That was like a turkey or something.
[179:01.92]Making a lot of money now.
[179:04.54]We can have dervish fire, quantum fire, quantum dervish, fire dervish.
[179:12.68]There was another chicken.
[179:17.04]These new?
[179:17.78]No, rock.
[179:20.64]Ooh.
[179:25.61]What's up there?
[179:26.13]It's meat.
[179:33.09]Angled Gordo.
[179:33.89]What's tangled?
[179:36.11]Okay, that's three new slimes in a row.
[179:37.99]That's a lot.
[179:40.59]Thank God.
[179:42.83]Alright, cool.
[179:43.43]So what's all the way at the top?
[179:52.01]I mean, I kind of.
[179:52.55]I'm using it.
[179:55.99]I'm using it.
[180:07.16]Geez, this is death.
[180:18.44]What the hell is that?
[180:31.02]You can style is shattered.
[180:33.52]Ooh, that's cool.
[180:40.58]What was that?
[180:40.90]I just saw like, how do I do?
[180:42.81]What do I do with these things?
[180:57.96]I mean, you want something.
[180:59.28]What do you want?
[181:00.91]What does he want?
[181:01.33]You're an everlasting gobstopper.
[181:05.01]What do I do with him?
[181:20.37]What?
[181:20.67]Something over there.
[181:23.11]What is that?
[181:36.87]Shit.
[181:37.13]There's a fountain?
[181:39.19]There's a water fountain.
[181:41.29]I need to suck up water.
[181:43.41]Damn it.
[181:47.80]I need water.
[181:49.94]Oh my god.
[181:54.22]Oh my god.
[181:54.70]Oh my god.
[181:55.18]Oh my god.
[181:55.56]I'm fine.
[181:55.94]Holy shit.
[181:56.80]What was I doing?
[181:58.44]What am I doing?
[182:00.63]Relax.
[182:04.99]That was almost a complete disaster.
[182:11.23]I'm going to go this way.
[182:21.79]I don't need the quantum slimes.
[182:28.76]Painted hen.
[182:35.66]Get away from me.
[182:39.59]I'm still going.
[182:41.61]Where's the teleporter?
[182:43.71]I need a teleporter right now.
[182:46.33]I'm going in too deep.
[182:47.37]I need a teleporter.
[182:48.17]Teleporter?
[183:04.61]Teleporter?
[183:10.72]Oh, damn.
[183:12.70]Uh... I kind of need to get to the... Wait.
[183:29.01]A nightshade.
[183:29.85]Ooh.
[183:36.79]That looks like a teleporter.
[183:39.07]Or that's a boss.
[183:43.31]I can't tell yet.
[183:44.41]That could be the end game boss.
[183:49.22]We will find out.
[184:06.14]all I want I just gotta walk around till I find a teleporter oh shit hold on give me these guys it's this way this way goes back there or let me just see what's at the end of the rainbow here
[184:36.47]What's at the end of the rainbow?
[184:37.35]Two doors, Beatrix.
[184:42.19]Left is filled with moments where there's two doors and you can only choose one.
[184:45.63]What?
[184:47.90]I came to the far, far range because a search for the unknown is in my bones.
[184:52.72]And in time, even a thousand light years away from Earth wasn't enough.
[184:56.46]So I searched for secrets within the ancient ruins that led me here.
[185:00.13]This place was my ticket to go even further.
[185:08.00]Which door?
[185:08.96]Left or right?
[185:13.20]The ruins are actually great engines that allow for travel through space and maybe even time.
[185:18.30]After years of study, I knew how to activate them and I alone would be the first to cross over into the true beyond.
[185:25.01]It was the ultimate adventure.
[185:27.75]But then there's that other door.
[185:29.55]I met Thora and fell in love.
[185:31.51]What are the chances of that?
[185:33.18]She had a piece of my heart and the universe had the other.
[185:36.12]Two doors, Beatrix.
[185:40.87]Alright, that one has like a space pod in it.
[185:43.09]What's this one have?
[185:43.59]It's the same door.
[185:56.72]It's actually the same door, at least the same place.
[186:10.18]The same door.
[186:10.58]You don't have to choose.
[186:13.23]It's actually the end.
[186:14.21]We've got weird porcupine fruits.
[186:30.80]I need to fill my water.
[186:37.19]I chose my door.
[186:39.23]I went back to the ranch and promptly sold it.
[186:41.11]I packed my things and took a tour of this beautiful land one last time, leaving these little notes for you.
[186:46.87]It was time I said goodbye to the get-your-fucking-mouse-off-the-screen life I had.
[186:52.54]My hands and feet tingled as I approached this monolithic warp terminal.
[186:56.46]What lay ahead of me was an adventure unlike anything I'd ever known in my life.
[187:00.06]I stepped on the platform, my heart racing.
[187:12.95]But I didn't go.
[187:14.17]I had packed for a new adventure, but it wasn't going to be beyond space and time.
[187:19.80]So I said a little goodbye to what could have been and headed to Thora's ranch.
[187:23.75]I'm looking forward to hearing the sound of those wind chimes.
[187:27.42]Cool.
[187:27.52]I chose my door.
[188:01.10]Didn't work out though.
[188:08.11]Choose the door.
[188:09.39]There is, I, you know, I think this guy got to the end and realized there's nothing here and then decided to write this.
[188:15.21]Oh yeah, I chose, there's nothing here.
[188:18.21]There's supposed to be like a teleporter leading to like another time period or something.
[188:21.19]Nothing here.
[188:22.23]But I guess I'm gonna have to like say that they were my adventure along the way.
[188:32.33]Just leave breadcrumbs and say, like, yeah, I chose my door.
[188:34.59]You choose your door.
[188:39.27]Uh, there's a giant X on the ground.
[188:41.07]There is no treasure on the ground, Beatrix.
[188:42.81]No treasure in there.
[188:43.51]I've already looked.
[188:45.29]The map is fucking useless.
[188:49.46]Alright.
[188:50.58]Get rid of the hens.
[188:53.00]I want whatever this is.
[188:54.92]Pickle pear.
[188:58.91]I'd won if you chose your door.
[189:00.45]Is that all that's over here?
[189:03.01]I think that's all I can do.
[189:06.92]Cool.
[189:07.14]Alright.
[189:07.56]Well, I chose... There's a huge beam on it, though.
[189:12.15]I don't believe that.
[189:14.15]Go check your emails.
[189:30.70]No, it's the same door.
[189:35.94]No, what they're trying to say is all paths might lead to the same outcome.
[189:42.14]You still got there.
[189:52.87]I'm really kind of disappointed there's no teleporter that can get the hell out of here and go back to Earth.
[189:58.81]All drains lead to the ocean.
[190:05.61]Do they?
[190:05.91]I don't know.
[190:08.47]It gets like processed.
[190:14.66]I'm Peter.
[190:15.56]My name is Peter.
[190:16.84]This is a playthrough.
[190:18.70]Oh.
[190:28.35]That was fucking terrifying.
[190:34.45]Can't do minus four.
[190:35.11]Only -2 works.
[190:46.30]Check the emails.
[190:47.18]I'm going back to the emails.
[190:48.84]I'm going to check the emails.
[190:55.04]I got slimes to take care of.
[190:59.54]right give me out I've got a lot of I've got a lot of science science projects to do I gotta get out of here down I'm stuck how do I get out of here
[191:39.41]This map doesn't really help me at all.
[191:54.21]I get up there.
[192:11.18]Up that way?
[192:17.32]5G gum.
[192:20.80]Jeremy, can you make the Diablo II Barbarians shouts again?
[192:25.55]Um... Okay.
[192:27.91]Okay.
[192:34.24]Oh, and then... That's fine potion.
[192:57.40]Where's that going?
[192:57.88]This way.
[193:07.64]Oh, how could I forget this one?
[193:13.63]Okay, goodbye.
[193:15.51]Thank you for coming.
[193:16.65]I hope you got the clip you were looking for.
[193:18.55]Get out of here.
[193:31.58]Oh, fire, fire.
[193:33.12]Oh, I can spray that with water.
[193:38.14]I don't have any water.
[193:38.90]Fuck.
[193:40.94]I'm going back to the ranch, and I'm going to do a bunch of research.
[193:44.03]I have to play the video game.
[193:45.25]Let's go.
[193:45.53]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[193:46.73]I don't even know how I got here.
[193:50.69]I don't even remember.
[193:54.17]I opened up one of these doors over here, right?
[193:57.99]I have no idea how I even got over here.
[193:59.43]Oh, there it is.
[194:08.98]I need teleporters.
[194:09.90]I know, man.
[194:10.62]I really do.
[194:12.08]Let me work on the farm for a while.
[194:13.58]Oh, sorry.
[194:17.56]Farm.
[194:18.92]Your cousin from Boston.
[194:22.35]What's in there?
[194:23.39]That's an IPA.
[194:24.37]Oh, it's a wicked IPA?
[194:25.33]What kind of IPA?
[194:27.13]Are you serious, dude?
[194:27.97]It's a wicked IPA.
[194:29.23]Your cousin from Boston.
[194:31.69]We just drink beer every day.
[194:38.36]What's that?
[194:38.64]Sam Adams?
[194:39.26]Yeah.
[194:39.90]I love that stuff.
[194:46.83]Oh, shit.
[194:47.15]There's another one.
[194:51.27]Oh, I need another key.
[194:52.11]Okay.
[194:52.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[194:53.59]Overwhelming myself.
[194:54.35]Let's go.
[194:59.12]I remember the heat level.
[195:00.98]Stop it.
[195:09.30]Oh, what do you got?
[195:09.72]A Laga?
[195:10.60]Oh, I love Boston Laga.
[195:21.28]Go for the fire.
[195:22.74]Ow.
[195:30.79]I want to get at least 10 fire slimes.
[195:32.09]I feel like it's going to be worth a shipload.
[195:37.44]He's pretending to be the bot.
[195:38.26]Wait, you guys don't know that's the Sam Adams Boston commercials?
[195:40.88]The guys like your cousin from... Everybody, they're on TV all the time.
[195:45.62]Of course you do.
[195:57.39]I want... Wait, what are these?
[195:59.25]Can I suck those up?
[196:02.05]No, they're just explosives.
[196:09.69]I'm actually surprised nobody has like put a deep fake me onto that guy.
[196:18.33]Okay, I got enough.
[196:19.57]I wanted 10.
[196:30.05]Someone's gonna do it now, yeah.
[196:33.62]It's okay.
[196:34.06]I thought there was water.
[196:35.12]I thought it was water.
[196:35.91]I thought it was water.
[196:36.59]It was blending into the whatever.
[196:37.75]Alright.
[196:38.97]R2-D2 is going to be fine.
[196:40.71]Just spray a little bit of oil in his can.
[196:44.70]Good.
[196:44.98]Let's go.
[196:45.86]Back to the farm.
[197:01.88]Sam Adams Omegalo, TV Omegalo, Boston Omegalo, Resident... No, it's ResidentSleeper, not Omegalo.
[197:15.23]There... Okay, there's the teleporter.
[197:20.15]They got R2.
[197:22.65]Oh no, they got R2.
[197:36.41]Back to the farm.
[197:37.16]I've got what I want.
[197:39.10]Move.
[197:40.24]While you were away.
[197:41.38]What happened?
[197:46.34]Did they make their own monetary system or something?
[197:54.15]While you were away, the boomcats made a trade route with the rad slimes.
[198:03.48]Quantums are probably gone.
[198:05.74]Wait.
[198:12.88]I was gone for a very long time, wasn't I?
[198:15.14]Okay, I thought they were all dying.
[198:17.02]Like, they weren't yellow anymore.
[198:18.67]They were, like, fucking disintegrating.

[201:55.52]I mean, wrong email.
[201:56.50]I don't have an email.
[202:15.09]Slime toy shop.
[202:16.09]Yup.
[202:27.62]Slime toys?

[203:10.04]Alright, where's the toy thing?
[203:16.26]Oh, over here.
[203:17.02]Is that a toy thing?
[203:18.44]No.
[203:20.62]Scroll down on the emails.
[203:37.88]I don't have it.
[203:38.36]Yeah, what are you guys on about?
[203:39.78]Didn't I get a new style?
[203:50.21]Who did I get the new style for?
[203:51.23]I don't like that one.
[203:55.47]Mosaic slime?
[203:56.87]I haven't even seen these yet.
[204:02.40]Tangle slime.
[204:06.56]Sleep.
[204:13.77]I slept.
[204:14.87]There are no emails.
[204:18.39]I'm going to the dock.
[204:20.00]I'm going to put new pens up.
[204:21.44]And no, I'm not actually.
[204:22.62]I'm getting rid of these guys.
[204:24.14]It's over.
[204:25.38]I'm just going to pull plug.
[204:27.68]I'm going to pull the plug.
[204:36.20]Yep.
[204:37.58]Okay.
[204:39.00]It's time to pull the plug.
[204:39.78]Ooh.
[204:42.89]Ooh.
[204:45.42]Alright, I'll look at that later.
[204:48.20]I'm putting dervish slimes in here.
[204:53.40]Get an incinerator.
[204:56.72]I don't have any room on this plot.
[205:00.85]Should I just delete this and put an incinerator here?
[205:09.39]I think I'm going to do that.
[205:11.61]I think so.
[205:12.57]It's time.
[205:14.21]Guys, wait.
[205:15.85]Let me clear this out first.
[205:17.13]Make sure there's nothing in here.
[205:18.77]Suck all this up.
[205:22.39]I'm going to deposit this into the inventory.
[205:24.51]I'm going to put the hens somewhere.
[205:27.11]Oh, my God.
[205:28.47]I need a...
[205:51.02]Can I put these hens in here?
[205:52.06]Okay, cool.
[205:56.54]Alright.
[205:58.00]What are the docks?
[206:06.59]That's a far run though.
[206:07.73]Okay.
[206:23.42]You guys are just getting out!
[206:25.43]Stop getting out!
[206:30.69]Oh my god, it's overflowing with jewels!
[206:34.63]I can't get this!
[206:37.15]It's too many!
[206:38.56]It's too many.
[206:39.58]It's too many.
[206:41.06]I have too- I have to get- I have- I don't know how to do this.
[206:43.18]This money is everywhere.
[206:47.12]Too many quantum escape artists.
[206:49.24]I don't know- Okay, I have 50 quantum plorts.
[206:53.17]Ah, sell them.
[206:54.37]I'm gonna sell everything.
[206:56.35]Get drones?
[206:57.13]I need the honey to get... Hold on.
[206:59.84]Make a teleporter to the dock.
[207:01.32]I will.
[207:01.78]Let me just do this.
[207:02.68]Let me get to square one.
[207:19.82]I need an apiary.
[207:20.86]Okay.
[207:36.91]Get rid of the boom cats?
[207:40.14]Yeah.
[207:42.14]Boom cats are gonna go away, and I'm gonna replace it with dervishes.
[207:46.92]Yes, good idea.
[207:49.58]I hope somebody likes vegetables.
[208:32.83]Broke his neck.
[208:42.33]How are you coming back?
[208:50.06]Here's my plan.
[208:51.46]Here's my plan.
[208:55.40]Okay.
[208:56.40]Good.
[208:57.97]We are going to see.
[208:58.77]We're going to be very, very careful here.
[209:02.49]What do the fire sla... He's dead.
[209:32.48]Okay.
[209:33.46]I'm gonna make this an incinerator and we're gonna keep this and put fire slimes in here and see what happens.
[209:37.99]Good plan.
[209:39.11]I like that plan.
[209:46.65]Goodbye.
[209:49.73]Incinerator.
[209:50.25]Done.
[209:56.44]ash troll allows you to collect the ash of incinerated food at its base which is eaten exclusively whoa accidentally just created exactly what we needed and got an email from casey hi casey what can I do for you hold on I'll reach your email in one second currently just murdering some cat slimes
[210:28.18]I incinerate these guys.
[210:38.59]You better not fucking kill me.
[210:39.99]Get away from me.
[211:04.75]This is so dangerous.
[211:10.53]Oh my God.
[211:15.30]Ow.
[211:29.20]Oh my God, you little dicks.
[211:30.78]I swear to God, I'm so glad to get rid of these things.
[211:51.36]Feed them?
[211:52.10]Feed them to incinerate them?
[211:53.42]That doesn't make any sense.
[211:54.16]Go ahead.
[212:16.13]Alright, we have successfully eliminated my least favorite person in the game.
[212:20.61]Here we go.
[212:20.91]Let's put this at normal food.
[212:24.22]I've got anything in there.
[212:25.92]Clean that out.
[212:34.44]Oh, these went up in value.
[212:37.40]Oh shit, nice.
[212:38.00]Okay.
[212:41.03]Fire slimes going in here.
[212:44.91]So fire slimes eat.
[212:46.19]Let's take a look at the slimepedia.
[212:52.59]They eat ash.
[212:55.61]They live on ash.
[212:57.69]Delete just about any food, but not without it being burnt to ash first.
[213:01.77]Use an incinerator with an ash throw upgrade.
[213:07.99]Fire slimes need ash to survive and will quickly snuff out if left on any other surface for too long.
[213:13.06]When keeping fire slimes in an ash throw, simply burn any food item to put... Wait.
[213:19.82]They go into the fire thing.
[213:34.52]They go in here?
[213:35.16]How do I just place them?
[213:50.30]That's annoying.
[213:55.94]Okay, I need to burn food.
[213:58.06]How many can be in here?
[213:59.64]Three or four?
[214:00.20]I need ash.
[214:03.61]Okay.
[214:06.19]Is that working?
[214:21.89]Already full.
[214:23.39]How can I tell?
[214:28.27]One escape.
[214:34.28]Fuck.
[214:35.48]Um...
[214:39.31]Upgrade it.
[214:40.03]It's already upgraded.
[214:45.11]Okay, can I have four in here?
[214:46.97]Can I have as many as I want in here?
[214:48.31]Four is the limit.
[214:59.02]As many as you want.
[214:59.66]Alright, how do I collect this?
[215:06.11]Fire plort.
[215:06.81]Nice.
[215:07.89]Oh, this is gonna be swell.
[215:12.39]Make sure you feed them.
[215:13.31]Is there like an ash meter?
[215:20.36]Ow.
[215:33.51]Uh-huh.
[215:35.61]Burn any food item to produce some ash and fill the trough.
[215:43.87]Oh, I see.
[215:45.06]Okay, I get it.
[215:46.92]It's just the sand.
[215:48.26]Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[215:49.10]Cool.
[215:55.08]How much are these worth?
[215:59.96]Very nice.
[216:00.40]Alright.
[216:01.63]So then what?
[216:02.13]I can put dervish slimes in here.
[216:04.75]Will they be mad about that?
[216:05.57]Okay.
[216:22.48]So should I, can I feed a fire plort to a dervish plort?
[216:28.42]Cool.
[216:35.58]No, fire plorts just worth just money.
[216:37.56]Okay, cool.
[216:38.94]So these guys, what are these guys like?
[216:44.46]Trickle pear is their favorite.
[216:45.62]A dervish slime is a swirling, whirling bundle of energy in a slimy form.
[216:49.54]Dervish slimes are commonly found in the glass desert, cruising across its dusty dunes at high speed atop little whirlwinds.
[216:54.71]One thing's for certain, wherever the dervish slime needs to go, it needs to get the ickits or ghosts quickly.
[217:00.03]Dervish slimes can cause total chaos on a ranch if not cared for properly.
[217:04.81]In addition to frequently riding atop whirlwinds at high speed and collecting objects along the way, a highly agitated dervish slime can produce giant cyclones of air that vacuum up and toss about anything they touch.
[217:18.04]When cyclones are roaring across your ranch, there's little you can do other than brace for the chaos.
[217:21.84]Oh god.
[217:26.26]Okay.
[217:26.64]So keep them happy.
[217:30.49]They love prickle pears.
[217:32.63]I know what I'm doing.
[217:48.38]They eat.
[217:49.02]We'll just keep them happy for a second here.
[217:50.70]Ooh, plorts.
[218:08.06]How's this Ash doing?
[218:10.06]Pretty good.
[218:12.96]Pretty good.
[218:13.36]Okay.
[218:15.10]Suck it up.
[218:22.12]Dervish, Flort.
[218:24.42]Oh, I'm assuming Dervish and Quantum is what to do.
[218:31.71]Is there a way I can reliably get these out without sucking these guys up?
[218:43.70]Alright, we're changing this.
[218:48.24]Remove the crops.
[218:50.76]What do I want in here?
[218:52.18]A prickled, prickled pear.
[218:57.26]Where is it?
[219:11.35]A prickled Rick.
[219:18.60]Here you go.
[219:19.04]Your favorite food.
[219:19.95]Alright.
[219:29.87]So now... It'll be okay for a little while.
[219:33.57]We'll get that shit to grow.
[219:34.54]They got food.
[219:35.18]How are you guys doing?
[219:36.68]I'm going to refill this tro.
[219:38.48]A lot of you guys... I need a bumblebee thing to refill this.
[219:48.81]There's got to be a better way to do that.
[219:49.85]Alright.
[219:58.90]Are they okay?
[220:05.54]Drones do it for you.
[220:06.60]He's doing this on purpose.
[220:08.62]Froth.
[220:09.40]Fro, whatever.
[220:10.08]Frog.
[220:11.62]Frog.
[220:18.18]I despise you.
[220:21.33]I think that's kind of harsh, man.
[220:22.35]Are you, though?
[220:23.97]Really?
[220:24.19]I'm sorry.
[220:25.57]Why?
[220:25.75]Alright, I'm going to do... I want to combine something here.
[220:33.05]Look at all those floors, hell yeah.
[220:35.26]Okay.
[220:46.55]They don't have any food in here and they want prickly pears.
[220:51.81]Alright.
[220:56.43]I'll give you $10 to pour your maple syrup down your pants pockets.
[221:00.93]I think these pants were more than $10, so it'd be way more than that.
[221:04.43]That would just ruin these pants.
[221:13.43]These guys are...
[221:17.84]I'm a toy.
[221:18.32]Alright, what are they like?
[221:19.62]What kind of toys are they like?
[221:21.50]A buzzy bee?

[222:35.35]I wish I had five more inventory slots.
[222:38.26]Inventory?
[222:39.32]I didn't do that on purpose.
[222:41.08]Keep this shit over here for a minute.
[223:01.68]Build.
[223:01.96]We're good.
[223:03.92]These guys eat fruits.
[223:05.40]Well, just have these for now.
[223:14.87]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

[224:00.62]You guys eat a lot.
[224:14.89]You guys eat too much.
[224:15.87]Alright, we're gonna thin this out a little.
[224:26.71]We don't need that many.
[224:27.49]Okay, I took out four.
[224:31.12]Let's have... We'll do... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[224:36.63]6 is okay.
[224:37.73]What do I do with the other ones?
[224:43.49]Just destroy?
[224:44.33]Put them in the water?
[224:47.12]These guys have food.
[224:49.60]Put the... Put them in storage.
[224:56.28]You can't store a fire slime.
[225:10.87]Alright, that's good.
[225:13.85]These ready?
[225:14.49]They are ready.
[225:16.95]Very cool.

[225:26.19]Eventually.
[225:26.64]I have a lot of points.
[225:30.86]I think I'm going to store these or something.
[225:32.52]I'm not really spending money anymore.
[225:37.88]Money sink, I think, until I'm done playing this game is this.
[225:42.85]Advanced slime toys.
[225:44.25]Well, that was a lot of money.
[225:46.15]Market link?

[226:54.66]He's going to burn out.
[227:00.27]Good, right?
[227:01.45]Okay.
[227:02.37]Come here.
[227:02.81]There we go.
[227:09.93]Thank you.
[227:10.39]Good.
[227:13.29]Good.
[227:15.40]Give me the toy.

[227:31.82]Quantum slimes.
[227:32.66]Love puzzle cubes.
[227:34.84]Oh, I don't.
[227:36.16]It's bringing me back bad memories.
[227:48.04]You guys good?
[227:50.16]No, they're not.
[227:59.38]Solve it.
[228:00.16]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[228:12.71]Fill it up.
[228:18.80]Okay, good.
[228:19.66]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[228:29.18]I am going to go deposit all of this shit.
[228:31.35]I would appreciate if you guys got back in the thing, though.
[228:35.87]Whatever.
[228:37.29]You'll just die.
[228:38.13]Whatever.
[228:38.57]But I only need, like, four of you anyways.
[228:40.87]Look, uh...
[228:51.33]The next thing I'm going to do is get a bunch of drones.
[228:55.35]Have them do all this work.
[228:56.87]That's next.
[228:57.89]That's coming up now.
[228:59.59]So let's do some selling.
[229:01.70]How much is this worth?
[229:02.90]Fire plorts are worth 51.
[229:04.70]That's it.
[229:05.56]Dervish is worth 74.
[229:06.28]I need quantum plorts, don't I?
[229:16.23]Save them.
[229:16.55]Okay.
[229:16.77]Okay.
[229:23.10]The pears are going over here.
[229:24.44]These guys love this shit.
[229:39.39]What about the quests?
[229:45.11]The quests haven't really been that good.
[229:46.61]They've been kind of lame.
[229:54.08]You want four fucking two turkeys, four strawberries, and 250 bucks?
[229:59.06]This is worthless.
[230:00.10]Alright, I'm going to go deposit this stuff and take a look at what I need to figure out how to do with these drones.
[230:09.13]I need honey.
[230:10.82]I have to build some excavators or whatever the hell they are.
[230:27.03]Do the metal and unlocks a new area.
[230:31.99]Alright.
[230:32.83]Utility drone.
[230:33.62]I need six wild honey.
[230:47.09]Wild honey.
[230:51.18]I need to make apiaries to get the honey.
[230:55.68]I have one of them already.
[230:57.04]I need pink plorts.
[231:06.19]Let's go get pink.
[231:08.93]Tons of pink plorts.
[231:12.37]Moss blanket apiary.
[231:13.55]That's the one.
[231:29.92]Hi, guys.
[231:34.37]Who's hungry?
[231:39.95]Ink.
[231:52.97]See, you needed these.
[231:53.95]That's right.
[231:54.41]That's true.
[231:56.54]That's absolutely accurate.
[231:57.76]I did need them.
[231:59.94]You're right.
[232:12.87]These lemons look so good.
[232:13.97]I really just want... Don't you want to just squeeze one of these in your mouth?
[232:16.97]Don't you feel like these are really cold?
[232:24.33]Ice cold lemon juice.
[232:26.31]Extra sour.
[232:27.79]That sounds awesome right now.
[232:34.89]okay uh apiary one two three how many can I have at once three right and put this in the moss level which is the moss one this one up here I can have six
[233:05.59]Eight.
[233:05.75]I can have eight?
[233:09.31]I don't know.
[233:10.01]That's six, isn't it?
[233:10.99]No, it's six.
[233:13.83]The genre of Jerma joke where he over-describes food.
[233:16.48]Good stuff.
[233:17.40]What?
[233:20.62]I want that.
[233:21.22]I want to eat that right now.
[233:23.96]Over-describing food.
[233:26.47]Wait, I didn't put those fire ploys in here.
[233:37.53]Oh, fuck.
[233:50.79]Well, I did it already.
[234:02.93]They added so much to this game.
[234:04.37]So am I just right now enjoying a fully just complete... How much of this stuff wasn't here three or four years ago?
[234:13.37]Tons of it.
[234:20.60]Really?
[234:21.08]Most of this?
[234:24.34]Holy shit.
[234:24.86]Okay, cool.
[234:25.98]Uh, let me fee... I need pink again.
[234:28.00]I'm gonna eventually need it.
[234:28.90]Ah, whatever.
[234:32.38]Uh, here.
[234:32.74]Just eat this.
[234:33.56]I'm gonna need pink again later.
[234:39.85]Everything before the temple.
[234:41.59]Seems like a lot.
[234:50.08]Uh, you... I'll throw this into the fire.
[234:56.75]You guys got food?
[234:58.19]You do, okay.
[234:59.21]Good.
[235:04.87]Uh, I don't... I just don't... I don't even want this.
[235:13.48]Okay, now... I just lost everything I was just doing.
[235:19.56]What am I doing?
[235:21.24]I just lost everything.
[235:23.42]Forget everything.
[235:23.95]What was I doing?
[235:27.47]I was about to go and... Oh, apiary.
[235:30.55]Right.
[235:42.24]I still have the gold.
[235:44.94]Okay.
[235:49.63]Up here, we're gonna teleport.
[235:52.99]I think I know what I'm doing.
[235:59.05]I think I know what I'm doing.
[236:00.07]I think.
[236:03.66]You guys are eating, right?
[236:13.54]Yeah.
[236:22.50]Okay.
[236:29.24]Okay.
[236:30.70]Through this teleporter.
[236:31.60]And then we're going to put apiaries everywhere.
[236:37.81]How much of your blood is heal at any moment?
[236:41.27]Um... I don't know.
[236:42.43]It depends.
[236:42.93]Okay, let's say I had a heal in the morning.
[236:46.77]That's... What?
[236:49.23]16 ounces of heal?
[236:52.49]Which... How does that get into my bloodstream?
[236:54.59]It goes in my stomach.
[236:55.89]From my esophagus into my stomach.
[236:58.46]And then down into my intestines and everything and absorbed.
[237:02.58]So... I don't know, over the course of the day, I don't know what I would be.
[237:08.17]Like, maybe it's like... 1.2, 1.4% heal at any given moment.
[237:13.75]Alright, we're going to put them all here.
[237:19.97]Apiary.
[237:23.48]Apiary.
[237:34.42]Okay, then up here.
[237:46.00]Ow, I'm sorry that hurt you.
[237:58.59]Alright, so that's one, two, three, four, five, six.
[238:04.36]12 minutes until I can come collect.
[238:08.71]In the meantime, we're gonna go sell a bunch of stuff.
[238:28.60]What do you think of Huel?
[238:29.62]Is it yummy?
[238:30.20]Genuinely curious.
[238:32.71]Uh, I can give you my review of all three flavors.
[238:36.37]Chocolate is the best tasting out of the three, but unfortunately it is also the thickest of the three.
[238:45.00]So if you want to sip on something for a long time, it's kind of like a, it has the consistency of a milkshake.
[238:50.70]It's pretty thick.
[238:52.32]Tastes the best though.
[238:53.98]Vanilla is a decent flavor.
[238:56.14]It's probably, I'd say it's second, maybe it's a tie between berry and vanilla.
[239:01.87]The only problem that I have with vanilla is it has kind of a weird consistency.
[239:06.84]It tends to have sort of a weird after texture in my mouth.
[239:11.30]It tastes great, but not my favorite.
[239:14.18]Now, berry on the other hand, berry on the other hand is a best of both worlds.
[239:18.79]It's thin enough to drink.
[239:21.61]So it's really easy to drink.
[239:22.99]It's thin.
[239:23.99]It's not super thick and heavy.
[239:26.85]And it also tastes good.
[239:27.67]It tastes like a strawberry milkshake.
[239:29.68]Almost like a berry go-gurt or something.
[239:32.24]I'd say that's probably my favorite one.
[239:35.24]Nobody asked.
[239:41.65]Yes, they did.
[239:42.67]Did.
[239:43.57]Oh, streamer just did a voice crack.
[239:46.88]Clip it.
[239:48.68]And put it under my bed.
[239:49.90]And the voice crack fairy will show up and give me $5.
[239:53.66]Okay.
[239:57.02]Time to sell a bunch of shit.
[240:11.47]I got 12 minutes.
[240:15.04]Tell me and yell at me when 12 minutes has gone by.
[240:16.90]Oh my God.
[240:33.11]What's wrong?
[240:33.73]What's wrong?
[240:34.19]What's wrong?
[240:34.63]Get that out of here.
[240:36.27]Get that out of here.
[240:36.85]Go the other way.
[240:38.60]Go the other direction.
[240:39.58]Do not... Oh, no!
[240:42.16]Come here, my babies!
[240:44.60]Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.
[240:48.34]Who's doing that in there?
[240:49.20]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[240:52.14]What's wrong with you in here?
[240:54.30]Stop this shit.
[240:58.04]Why are they doing this?
[241:01.18]They're hungry?

[256:55.90]They've cornered the market on anytime you can reference anything?
[256:59.10]Referential humor is not allowed because it's Family Guy.

[259:35.16]Kind of went something like this.
[259:42.45]Hey, you guys remember the time...
[259:48.12]I think you guys say I have Family Guy jokes because I talk like Peter Griffin.
[259:51.57]Because I have a Boston accent.
[259:52.71]And he's got a Boston accent too.
[259:54.23]So whenever I do like a weird voice, it's just Peter Griffin because we're from the same place.

[260:27.88]Poor Chubba.
[260:28.62]Poor Chuck and Pat.
[260:31.38]We have the same accent.
[260:33.38]I'm sorry.
[260:34.52]I talk like a cartoon character that has my accent.
[260:36.93]Well, I'm sorry.
[260:37.71]I'm sorry.
[260:46.84]I'm from New England, but I don't talk like an idiot.
[260:48.67]Omega Law, you're so smart.

[261:52.23]I'm also from there.
[261:57.97]Oh, hold on a second.
[261:59.93]I have a... Yeah, I have a Boston accent sometimes.
[262:03.45]I have a New England accent.
[262:04.47]I do.
[262:06.05]I don't sit here and talk like this.
[262:08.49]Sometimes I enunciate my accent sometimes for fun because it's fun to do an accent.
[262:15.67]That's not how... Listen to me talking.
[262:16.90]I don't talk like that on a regular basis.
[262:18.16]I do it like to do like the, hey, I'm from Boston joke guy.
[262:23.00]Even though I talk like that sometimes.
[262:24.54]It was right there.
[262:26.14]Cockies.
[262:26.60]Yeah.
[262:26.98]Cockies.
[262:27.56]Where are my cockies?
[262:28.14]I don't know.
[262:28.40]Where are your cockies?
[262:28.86]I don't care.
[262:29.18]I don't know.

[262:49.71]Clean up your room.
[262:50.49]Room.
[262:50.87]Room.
[262:50.97]Room.
[262:54.00]He's a Family Guy streamer.
[262:57.34]I gotta go to my room and clean up my car.
[262:59.24]He's not a Family Guy.
[263:00.22]He says Family Guy things.
[263:01.46]He's a Family Guy.
[263:02.30]He's so mad.
[263:09.62]Alright, I can make a drone.
[263:18.82]Can I make more than one?
[263:20.76]I just made one.
[263:22.15]What do I do with it?
[263:27.14]Where is it?
[263:27.50]I have two drones.
[263:41.33]T. Oh.
[263:44.08]Okay.
[263:46.94]What should I do with them?
[263:59.94]Place it down.
[264:00.42]It's a gadget.
[264:01.10]Okay.
[264:03.77]Read the manual.
[264:04.41]Yeah, let me see if I can... Alright, so if I... Grown.
[264:13.20]I help learn more.
[264:17.92]Drones are a highly useful gadget that can reduce some of the work a rancher needs to perform on the ranch to keep things running smoothly.
[264:24.88]Once you build a drone, simply give it a program using three simple inputs.
[264:28.62]Target, where the drone is looking for on your ranch.
[264:32.41]Source, where the drone gets its target.
[264:35.85]Destination, where the drone takes its target.
[264:38.75]If you give a drone an impossible task or a drone simply cannot complete their task, presently it'll go idle.
[264:44.88]A drone can run for about a day before it will return to its station and must be powered again, up again.
[264:49.52]Simply give it a refreshing blast of water to recharge it.
[264:53.08]A drone only works on your ranch and will only work within the ranch expansion in which you place it.
[264:57.76]Sometimes a drone will overflow an auto feeder or silo due to the bug in their software.
[265:03.99]The S7C Corporation insists this bug is a feature.
[265:09.87]Am I fucking making you angry by talking like a guy from New England?
[265:17.47]This is all an act, guys.
[265:19.57]That's how I normally talk.
[265:21.56]It's difficult to do this.
[265:23.04]I'm trying very hard not to talk like that, as you can tell.
[265:30.60]That's my real voice.
[265:40.68]Okay, target what the drone is looking for on your... Now I'm gonna start doing it.
[265:46.25]What the drone... Where the drone gets its target, where the drone takes its target.
[265:49.69]So I want to take... So target what the drone is looking for on the ranch.
[265:55.85]So if I put him down.
[265:57.87]Install.
[265:58.27]Let me see what this does.
[266:02.86]So, activate.
[266:04.64]Target is gonna be... This is so cool.
[266:14.00]The target is going to be... Fruit.
[266:21.44]The source will be from a garden.
[266:24.26]And the destination is going to be auto feeders.
[266:34.59]What?
[266:34.79]No?
[266:35.01]What?
[266:39.17]Don't I want to just kind of go around and fly around and do this?
[266:43.85]Get the fruit from the gardens, right?
[266:45.02]Pick a specific fruit.
[266:49.18]Can I?
[266:49.46]Oh, okay.
[266:52.38]Specific fruit.
[266:53.20]So you want to get a prickle pear from a garden and put it into an auto-feeder.
[267:01.23]But can I say specifically?
[267:02.35]Can I say specifically?
[267:06.59]I can't put this one.
[267:11.27]Does that matter?
[267:13.10]Be all fruits.
[267:16.00]Do all fruit.
[267:17.78]That's what I did before.
[267:18.52]Everyone screamed at me.
[267:25.25]Let's see what he does.
[267:36.14]Wake up.
[267:41.50]Okay, now I want to put, uh, veggies into the incinerator.
[267:44.46]Target.
[267:57.85]Veggies.
[267:59.27]Source.
[268:00.65]Gardens.
[268:01.93]Destination.
[268:03.08]Into the incinerator.
[268:04.52]Activate.
[268:08.48]Any water?
[268:12.62]There's no fruit to collect?
[268:13.60]Yeah, there is.
[268:16.10]The prickly pear.
[268:18.46]I got to get water.
[268:18.98]Hold on.
[268:21.62]Where's the fountain thing?
[268:22.62]It's like here somewhere, right?
[268:31.77]Where's the water spout?
[268:32.51]Do I not have one here?
[268:37.35]I'm just going to go to the pond.
[268:51.65]Hi, guys.
[268:56.06]Okay.
[268:56.54]Splash.
[269:10.64]Oh, the fruit needs to be there for... Okay.
[269:15.72]Oh, there he goes.
[269:16.21]Look.
[269:19.55]He's going to put this in the incinerator.

[274:52.90]Look, I got plenty of money.
[274:54.24]I'll be fine.
[275:08.07]Are you done with this game yet?
[275:10.61]um maybe after tonight I don't know maybe I still really like this game I'm still having a lot of fun maybe we'll see I do really like it but I have a lot of other stuff that I want to stream I I got to get on some other projects and some other stuff to do so and I don't know
[275:39.09]I have to go through a couple of processes to start getting ready for some stuff next week.
[275:43.30]By the way, uh, on March 6th, if you haven't been to the stream in a while, uh, we're going to get a, there's going to be an interesting stream.
[275:50.76]I would not miss it.
[275:51.54]1 p.m.
[275:51.88]Pacific.
[275:52.26]Get your shovel.
[275:53.70]Get your, um, you know, get your shovel and, I don't want to give you any, whatever.
[276:01.05]Just, just, it's, we're going to be, it's archaeology and I need to, I got to figure out a few things and you need to see it.
[276:11.56]Not Catboy.
[276:12.46]No.
[276:12.82]It's... We're doing... We have to do some archaeology.
[276:24.27]Might be vague about it.
[276:25.25]You want me to spoil all the things that I'm going to do on that stream?
[276:30.21]You want me to read you the Wikipedia article before you watch it?
[276:32.33]Oh.
[276:33.07]Oh.
[276:38.73]Alright, deposit these pink plorts, and then I can make another couple.
[276:50.12]When's the stream?
[276:50.84]March 6th, at 1 o'clock Pacific. ...
[277:08.66]Can we get any hints?
[277:11.20]It's an archaeology stream.
[277:14.13]It's the only thing you really need.
[277:18.51]Advanced.
[277:20.93]One, two, three.
[277:25.68]I can get it.
[277:48.19]Freeman doesn't know the difference between archaeology and geology.
[277:53.55]Well, can't it be both?
[277:56.17]Why can't it be both?
[277:57.92]Why can't they be both things?
[278:00.18]I don't know.
[278:02.44]Whatever.
[278:06.08]I'm doing archaeology.
[278:08.97]I'm doing archaeologist stuff.
[278:15.65]It's not both.
[278:16.89]I didn't say it was both.
[278:17.89]I said the stream could have both.
[278:21.18]Does it have to be one or the other?
[278:22.42]Why can't we do multiple things on a stream?
[278:25.68]You putting up what I'm kicking down?
[278:36.59]Don't spoil.
[278:37.40]I'm not spoiling anything.
[278:48.14]I need more pinks.
[278:54.00]Is it going to be on the same level as the carnival stream?
[279:00.76]I would say more on the lines of the Halloween stream.
[279:07.20]Okay, a little more involved in the Halloween stream.
[279:21.98]Uh, I need food.
[279:22.58]That means Bugleberry?
[279:27.37]That does not mean Bugleberry.
[279:28.51]That just means the same kind of... The same, I guess, effort.
[279:32.27]To what the fuck are you?
[279:33.35]Okay.
[279:33.53]Why are you doing like the anime character thing?
[279:45.14]Running around with like a piece of food in your mouth.
[279:51.37]Eat those vegetables.
[280:03.49]Hurry.
[280:08.17]You feel like you don't have enough time on your hands.
[280:11.97]Yeah, all the time.
[280:15.91]I would say all the time.
[280:21.65]How many do I need?
[280:22.21]How many pink floors do I need?
[280:23.27]Come on.
[280:23.65]Somebody eat.
[280:26.49]Thank you.
[280:36.28]Oh, another email.
[280:36.86]Didn't people want me to read?
[280:39.60]There's another one I want.
[280:40.74]Remail from Casey.
[280:42.18]Whatever.
[280:50.42]Life is different now.
[280:51.00]I had a year to think about things while you slept on your way across the stars.
[280:54.21]Who is this person?
[280:55.01]I feel like I haven't replied to Casey.
[280:59.81]But I keep getting gigantic emails from him.
[281:11.09]I hope the sun sets over there as gorgeous as they are over here.
[281:14.23]I'm glad I've shared part of me with you, Beatrix Lebeau.
[281:17.21]I'm happy to know that maybe one of these stars I see up there in the sky is you.
[281:23.24]Okay.
[281:24.22]How do I... Am I gonna stream Blizzcon?
[281:28.40]I don't think I can do that.
[281:29.92]I don't think I... I'm not gonna stream Blizzcon.
[281:38.73]I think... Don't you have to pay to watch Blizzcon?
[281:41.41]Isn't it like $500?
[281:48.01]It's free this year.
[281:49.31]Hmm.
[281:58.68]Alright, I'm going.
[282:00.22]He's so cute.
[282:00.88]Look at this bushy thing.
[282:09.11]Get back in there.
[282:09.87]You're going to starve.
[282:18.93]Don't fall out.
[282:22.03]You're going to go to BlizzCon.
[282:23.94]I don't think that's happening this year.
[282:34.61]Have a drone collect the fire ploys.
[282:36.11]That's actually a really good idea.
[282:37.25]Alright.
[282:37.57]Advanced apiary.
[282:38.41]There it is.
[282:38.83]Six.
[282:40.97]Now, do I want more drones or do I want to try to get that royal jelly?
[282:45.39]Should I start with just to get a shitload of drones, have them do everything for me?
[282:53.19]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[282:59.59]What are we doing in here?
[283:00.27]Collection.
[283:00.83]Yep.
[283:02.15]I'm going to sell.
[283:16.63]I want to make... Okay.
[283:18.22]Before I do this... Yeah.
[283:21.02]Alright.
[283:21.32]Hold on.
[283:25.64]They eat vegetables.
[283:26.66]They don't even like that food.
[283:28.08]I want to make some... I want to make some crystal...
[283:32.53]Wind.
[283:33.55]Crystal wind.
[283:34.09]I think that'd be kind of cool.
[283:37.11]I'm making crystal winds.
[283:48.94]Yeah, we're going for it.
[283:50.26]Crystal winds.
[283:53.56]I'm doing it.
[283:56.04]Save it for the mosaic slime.
[283:57.74]Oh.
[284:14.15]Do whatever you want.
[284:15.49]Yeah, I could.
[284:18.41]I could, but I feel like I'm right in the next area anyways.
[284:20.76]They make a lot of money.
[284:30.08]Alright.
[284:31.56]It's time to plant the apiaries into the jungle area.
[284:36.69]Let's go.
[284:39.89]Go get the mosaic slime.
[284:40.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[284:42.43]Let me plant these first.
[284:45.01]How fast can I do that?
[284:46.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[284:49.77]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[284:51.11]And pretty fast.
[284:51.87]I don't want these in my inventories.
[285:09.72]I'm just going to feed them.
[285:20.03]The atmosphere is beautiful in this game.
[285:21.33]It is really nice.
[285:22.55]It's very nice.
[285:23.13]It's a really sharp looking game.
[285:33.92]Okay, here we go.
[285:39.48]Advanced Apiary, go.
[285:40.64]Advanced Apiary, go.

[286:44.01]Okay.
[286:44.35]I'm ready.
[286:49.54]I'll come back here in 15 minutes.
[286:53.40]Next step.
[286:54.30]Make sure I have water and I'm going to go and I'm going to collect one of those mosaic slimes.
[286:57.72]We're going to make a mosaic wind slime.
[287:16.23]I can open this now.
[287:24.60]Oh, that's royal jelly.
[287:26.48]Cool.
[287:26.92]Alright, nice.
[287:29.20]Well, I have one now.
[287:33.17]Do mosaic crystal.
[287:34.23]Yeah, I'm going to do mosaic crystal and then mosaic wind.
[287:40.46]That'd be fun.
[287:56.12]What's that?
[287:56.68]Another email from Casey.
[288:11.73]These guys are just going wild.
[288:13.85]They're almost all... Okay, I don't care anymore.
[288:19.33]I don't even care anymore.
[288:22.30]I really don't.
[288:25.00]I don't need quantum anymore.
[288:29.12]I'm just going to store like one quantum plort and then these guys can just go free.
[288:49.31]They get out too easily.
[288:56.57]Okay.
[288:57.99]Save one quantum plort in the event that I want to make a quantum... If lemons, I need more pinks eventually.
[289:16.66]Let's get it.
[289:32.21]email email games games email that's the homestar runner web page home page somebody said it wow I'm surprised you got that a lot of you are getting that wow that's interesting
[289:57.03]Another tour.
[289:57.49]Hey, B. There's another tour coming up and I have a feeling that this will be the one.
[290:02.19]Here I am, packing my bags and thinking of you.
[290:03.77]Maybe this is how it felt when you were leaving for your Big Adventure.
[290:05.89]Lots of excitement.
[290:07.84]I keep thinking that maybe I'll catch you somewhere out there in the crowd.
[290:09.92]If that ever happens, I promise I'll sing a song for you.
[290:13.82]Alright, Casey.
[290:14.42]Thank you.
[290:16.42]Wait, what?
[290:18.89]It just took a moment to reflect.
[290:21.13]She thought about Hobson and Thora and the adventures she'd had exploring the far, far range.
[290:26.22]Most of all, she thought of Casey and wondered where life would take her next.
[290:29.40]Am I getting, like, enrage-timered?
[290:31.48]I just hit the enrage timer in the game!
[290:41.93]What?
[290:42.55]I took too long?
[290:45.16]I took too long?
[290:45.94]Are you serious?
[290:47.54]I'm like, I'm gonna go get these slimes over here.
[290:57.00]I'm gonna go do this one.
[290:59.80]I'm gonna do that one.
[291:09.87]No, I'm done.
[291:11.07]I hit the games and rage timer.
[291:16.19]No, that's fine.
[291:17.97]It takes like 40 days or whatever.
[291:20.67]You do this and the game kind of ends and you can keep playing.
[291:24.85]Yeah, that's definitely what it is.
[291:27.27]Hey, Chris Lum.
[291:29.43]What a God of a game designer.
[291:30.91]I love this game.
[291:31.57]It was fantastic.
[291:35.14]Hey, game development studios, just give that person a hundred million fucking dollars for the next game.
[291:42.24]Do it.
[291:43.38]I want investors on there.
[291:44.88]Whatever budget you were going to put into the next Call of Duty, give it to this guy.
[292:03.42]I'd give it a hundred million dollars.
[292:13.13]Don't limit creativity with contracts.
[292:15.03]Let them do what they want.
[292:16.53]Oh, there would be no strings attached.
[292:18.49]If I had a billion dollars right now, I would be writing checks left and right.
[292:25.14]Like, I don't even fucking care if you pay me back.
[292:26.94]Just make something cool.
[292:28.36]And then I would pace around my living room for four years until it came out.
[292:49.78]Isn't that what Death Stranding was?
[292:51.08]I have no idea.
[292:52.06]I don't know.
[292:59.77]Cool.
[293:00.03]Alright.
[293:00.33]Well, I was kind of in the middle of something.
[293:06.08]Wait, did the credits take more than 12 minutes?
[293:08.06]Because my apiaries are probably done.
[293:12.26]Be brave, pile of shit.
[293:26.24]Oh, cool.
[293:26.42]Alright, let's sleep.
[293:33.14]Hello there.
[293:33.56]Thanks for taking me to the old ranch.
[293:37.71]Wait a minute.
[293:38.67]As a little thank you, I've activated three secret vaults that I built years ago to stash a small fortune.
[293:46.64]You know me, I like a good adventure.
[293:47.70]I'm not telling you where the vaults are located.
[293:49.12]Oh, slime key.
[293:56.71]Single spare slime key just in case you can't seem to find the last one.
[294:02.37]Wait, what?
[294:06.61]How many...
[294:09.61]You'll never find it.
[294:10.93]Probably not.
[294:11.39]Alright, let me... Let me store this and then we'll keep... We'll do the thing.
[294:17.52]I want to go... I want to go back to that crystal world.
[294:40.54]I have water.
[294:42.96]Teleport to the crystal world and then I'm just going with empty.
[294:51.46]The lead dev, musician, and artist of this game made Spiral Knights, a free MMO on Steam.
[294:55.37]It's very fun, has the exact same atmosphere.
[294:57.09]Please try it.
[294:58.73]You usually get to the boss in two to three streams.
[295:00.17]It's been updated over time.
[295:01.19]Oh, well.
[295:02.11]Okay, cool.
[295:08.79]Why have I heard that name before?
[295:14.72]Alright, we're going... Where's the teleporter to get here?
[295:18.23]I feel like this is ridiculous.
[295:20.39]Where's the port here?
[295:22.09]I'm way too far away.
[295:23.01]I don't want to walk all the way over here.
[295:36.93]this is that's just a one way to I have to walk here I have to build one oh shit I'm definitely not doing that that that's not happening on this stream I guarantee it I'm telling you for real uh here listen uh we're gonna get to this part here
[295:56.24]I'm going to clean up a little bit.
[295:57.30]I'm going to make the slimes I want to make.
[295:59.04]I want to make a mosaic crystal.
[296:01.26]And I want to make a mosaic wind.
[296:03.84]And then I'm going to make some money.
[296:06.49]I'm going to buy... I'm going to open this.
[296:08.55]This game is... No, I'm not going to make that joke because I love it.
[296:30.30]I just moved to Boston and the beer here sucks.
[296:41.14]Well, sorry to hear that.
[296:42.69]Try the cider.
[296:43.45]It's way better.
[296:44.43]That doesn't make me mad or anything though.
[296:54.09]I don't have some attachment to Boston beer.
[297:02.33]What'd that guy say?
[297:03.29]What the fuck that dude just say?
[297:04.37]You don't like Boston beer?
[297:06.01]What kind of fucking beer you drink?
[297:13.55]Oh, I don't care.

[298:10.58]Oh, but what do we do now?
[298:12.26]Don't worry.

[298:21.87]Don't even need Tom anymore.
[298:35.32]No, what we're doing is we're going to build up our farm system.
[298:37.18]We're going to do... Take a couple years, sub 500.
[298:40.14]It's fine.
[298:40.48]It's okay.
[298:40.92]Our farm system is going to come up.
[298:48.69]All about farm system.
[298:49.73]The farm system.
[298:50.87]Our farm system.
[298:56.71]And that person has not watched a single minor league game at all.
[299:00.67]Or a college game.
[299:02.79]Our minor league system is our farm.
[299:04.61]Our farm system is great.
[299:05.53]I love our farm.
[299:10.05]We got tomatoes, chili peppers.
[299:19.19]Hopefully Pedro Martinez can pee into the ground.
[299:22.17]He was the best.
[299:32.43]Alright, that way.
[299:45.16]Gronk ball.
[299:50.00]Didn't Gronk used to spike balls in the ground and they would explode?
[299:53.16]Or am I making him up and making him a superhero?
[299:55.70]I don't know why I have this memory of Gronk spiking a ball in the end zone and it exploded.
[300:04.63]That was a dream?
[300:05.95]That must have been right after we won in 2015.
[300:12.62]I got to go this way.
[300:15.62]All the way around.
[300:18.97]Gronk in the rumble.
[300:19.99]No.
[300:20.17]I'm not going to put Gronkowski in the Jerm of rumble.
[300:24.57]Why?
[300:33.29]That was Mr. Super Bowl from Blitz the League 2.
[300:38.05]Not even a real person.
[300:39.84]Not even a real game.
[300:43.08]That's what it was.
[300:44.14]Okay.
[300:44.94]You can tell how much I pay attention to football.
[300:48.66]I played that.
[300:49.48]I streamed that and that was one of the things you could do.
[300:55.15]Right.
[301:04.70]We're not even talking about that Gronk.
[301:06.22]We're talking about the one from Spore.
[301:09.41]You are?
[301:09.91]Did I go off on a football thing for no reason?
[301:14.39]You guys talking about Gronk from Spore?
[301:16.33]Up there.
[301:38.85]Tom brady you know like here's the thing I'm like Tom brady wow the new England patriots he won so many times and what a legacy Tom brady the best football team ever dynasty right but part of me kind of wanted him to throw like 40 interceptions in that game you know he didn't
[302:03.62]Part of me wanted every single one of his passes to get intercepted and break every single record a hundred times.
[302:09.87]This is the most unbelievable thing we've ever seen at the Super Bowl.
[302:13.83]Every single pass attempt by Tom Brady has been intercepted and run back for a touchdown.
[302:19.23]This has never happened before, ever.
[302:20.82]In the history of all sports, I'd be like, oh, that's fucking kind of funny.
[302:29.21]The other team is up by... I don't even know what the other team it was.
[302:31.69]There's the Buccaneers and somebody else.
[302:34.03]The... Kings?
[302:37.46]I don't know why the Kings.
[302:39.86]The Kings?
[302:42.72]The Chiefs.
[302:43.44]Okay.
[302:45.36]Why did I say Kings?
[302:46.64]Whatever.
[302:46.96]Okay.
[302:55.41]Anyways.
[302:56.29]They would be up by like 200 points.
[302:59.72]And they would do the thing right before they go to commercial break where Tom Brady screams fuck as loud as he can.
[303:05.29]And it's very clearly that's what he did.
[303:07.99]It's a kind of a close-up.
[303:08.81]He's sitting on the bench.
[303:09.39]He spits.
[303:10.29]He spits twice.
[303:11.85]He dumps water all over his head and he goes, Fuck!
[303:17.56]I've seen that so many times.
[303:27.05]After like the 25th interception in a row, what would he do?
[303:30.51]Okay, I need crystal slimes.
[303:36.95]I have water.
[303:37.39]I can get back that way.
[303:41.57]Water the plants.
[303:50.92]That's not doing anything.
[303:58.64]It needs special water.
[304:02.46]Need holy water.
[304:03.46]Okay, that's bullshit.
[304:19.44]It's new.
[304:20.70]Oh no, I had beats already.
[304:25.58]What the fuck is going on in here?
[304:28.50]um what do you mean what's going on here drop kick a rotisserie chicken across uh nah no one does the drop kick like doug flutie
[304:49.26]One of the only guys in football who will do that.
[304:52.14]He drop kicked the ball into the end zone past the uprights.
[304:56.52]No one's ever done that before.
[304:57.48]Doug Flutie's the only one.
[305:03.64]Okay, here we go.
[305:07.97]So where are those mosaic ones?
[305:16.65]They have a face.
[305:17.33]Where are they?
[305:20.02]underneath okay there we go alright so spray this guy with water uh that's not that didn't do anything
[305:53.82]You need holy water, dude.
[305:56.08]Where am I supposed to get holy water?
[306:03.31]He needs to get a mosaic plort.
[306:05.13]Where do I get a mosaic plort?
[306:13.55]Hmm.
[306:21.56]Need mosaic slimes, veggies.
[306:24.84]Yeah, I've got to put a plort in there, but I haven't seen any mosaic slimes.
[306:28.42]Are they in this area?
[306:29.12]Have I just missed them?
[306:30.66]Do they show up at night or something?
[306:41.96]Thank God I almost fell.
[306:43.00]Alright, I need to get out of here.
[306:52.66]How do I get out of here?
[306:57.32]Eat the Gordo slime.
[307:00.68]Shit.
[307:06.59]I really thought I was gonna be able to get in here.
[307:13.93]Come on.
[307:17.79]Give me a crystal.
[307:25.13]Aww.
[307:27.01]Or mosaic, I mean.
[307:27.75]Damn it.
[307:32.06]Feed a big slime.
[307:33.32]I didn't come here with that.
[307:34.86]I came here with the intention, though.
[307:38.48]The intention was to fill up on... Oh, man.
[307:42.23]That was painful.
[307:46.83]I have nothing to add.
[307:47.67]I just wanted to have my message highlighted.
[307:49.35]Oh, that's alright, man.
[307:57.70]It's nighttime.
[307:58.30]I don't see anything.
[308:09.32]It's nighttime though.
[308:14.28]Fill up that first fountain with rock plorts.
[308:17.81]Hmm.
[308:18.01]Hmm.
[308:21.03]Hmm.
[308:24.85]Hmm.
[308:31.15]Mmm... I'm ready to eat this.
[309:02.80]I hope something gets... whatever.
[309:05.90]That's a really mean thing to say.
[309:08.04]Really mean thing to say to somebody.
[309:18.91]Eat that.
[309:27.13]What does this mean?
[309:31.03]What's my favorite color?
[309:32.15]Blue.
[309:33.53]Or green.
[309:34.07]Or teal.
[309:37.50]My favorite color is the green stripe of the aqua fresh toothpaste.
[309:40.36]It's not a lie.
[309:42.54]That's what I truly want.
[310:07.42]God damn it.
[310:14.69]No, I... This is not working.
[310:22.15]That's not the first fountain.
[310:26.94]This whole place is coming down.
[310:28.12]You have to do the first one first.
[310:40.52]Where's the first fountain?
[310:43.52]I don't remember even passing one.
[310:44.87]Is it on here?
[310:50.13]Same as the door puzzle.
[310:51.01]You have to shoot ploys into the mouths.
[310:52.27]Okay.
[310:56.31]He's ignoring the chat.
[310:57.07]No, no.
[310:59.25]So I have to do earlier in the level.
[311:00.87]Okay.
[311:06.41]Well, I'm probably getting close to calling it.
[311:08.82]I'm getting close to calling it.
[311:12.80]I'll do this part here and then we'll probably call the stream.
[311:16.74]Had a lot of fun.
[311:19.48]I've had a lot of fun with you today.
[311:25.14]Get out of here.
[311:28.95]Rock plorts in the fountain.
[311:30.15]We'll go slime lamp.
[311:42.30]What's the verdict on next Slime Rancher stream?
[311:49.30]I don't think so.
[311:52.98]I think that's it.
[311:53.74]The stream content of Slime Rancher.
[311:57.87]Probably.
[311:59.39]Probably going to... Ooh, no.
[312:05.01]If I'm going to play, I will probably just grind and play on my own if I feel like it.
[312:10.85]Just have my mouth open.
[312:15.90]Maybe?
[312:17.82]After all this time, he hates it.
[312:19.34]No, I just... I think I'm pretty much almost at the end game.
[312:25.17]I'm going farther away.
[312:32.45]Wait.
[312:33.87]I want rocks.
[312:34.41]Can you guys give me rocks?
[312:36.81]No.
[312:42.12]You have a plort too.
[312:46.38]You're not even that close to the end game.
[312:48.02]Well, well, maybe one day I'll get there.
[312:52.94]So what you can expect in the next three or four days, I'm going to try to get, I haven't done it yet.
[313:01.50]I have to sign up and do some stuff with the GTRP server.
[313:05.24]So I'm going to like go through that process over the next few days and see what happens.
[313:11.76]I am not guaranteeing that I'm going to be playing GTA RP.
[313:15.60]I don't know.
[313:15.90]I think there's like a system where you have to get, uh, brought, you have to get like approved and whitelisted and everything, I think, or something or other.
[313:24.51]I don't really know.
[313:25.15]Uh, GTA RP.
[313:28.39]Yeah.
[313:30.55]We'll see.
[313:31.25]I, once I, if I get in, maybe we'll do a few streams of you just fucking around in RP.
[313:36.25]Okay.
[313:41.52]That's on tap, potentially.
[313:50.18]Besides that, there are a lot of random games that I still have to play.
[313:56.32]I still want to play.
[313:57.08]I still have Thousand Year Door, by the way.
[314:00.80]Maybe if GTA RP doesn't work out next week, I'll start Thousand Year Door.
[314:06.72]Maybe if GTRP doesn't work out in the next week, I'll play... I don't know.
[314:16.99]Figure it out.
[314:23.25]I got a handful of games that I have installed that I want to do.
[314:25.27]Alright, I am very lost.
[314:29.38]This way.
[314:40.18]Alright, there's one at the beginning of the level.
[314:42.02]I'm curious about this.
[314:43.52]Where's the one at the beginning of the level?
[314:45.32]Rock Fountain.
[314:54.54]Is this guy too?
[315:03.65]Rock Fountain.
[315:08.29]I guess they have rock.
[315:09.27]Oh.
[315:13.73]I found him.
[315:14.23]I need more rocks.
[315:32.35]Oh, crap.
[315:33.05]I need, oh, I need rocks.
[315:37.01]Damn it.
[315:37.47]I need food to feed.
[315:38.75]I need a... Okay, where's rocks?
[315:44.34]It was a crystal rock jumping around here.
[315:45.86]I see him somewhere right here.
[315:48.30]It's a crystal rock jumping around here, around here, around here, around here.
[315:51.70]What the fuck was that?
[316:04.01]No!
[316:04.77]I need to... Come here, you.
[316:08.97]Eat.
[316:13.37]Two more?
[316:16.11]Oh, you fuck.
[316:18.85]You fuck.
[316:29.63]Auctioneer.
[316:33.21]Okay, these two.
[316:34.89]Let's see what this does.
[316:36.19]I'm very curious about this.
[316:57.25]I hear water.
[317:00.00]I hear water.
[317:00.94]Where is it?
[317:09.46]I hear water.
[317:15.95]It's down.
[317:27.57]Whoa.
[317:29.85]What does this mean?
[317:33.05]Ancient water.
[317:45.74]Oh, dumbass.
[317:49.18]Whoa.
[317:55.10]Wait, that's a secret cat!
[317:56.02]That's a secret cat!
[317:56.74]That's a secret cat!
[317:57.86]How do I feed him?
[317:58.98]He eats meat?
[318:00.94]I need food!
[318:02.28]Oh my god, that's a- I don't know what that is.
[318:04.72]I don't have any food down here.
[318:06.10]I need food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food!
[318:09.40]Food, food!
[318:13.22]I got- Oh, I got mosaic!
[318:16.40]Holy shit, I got mosaic slime.
[318:18.18]Who cares about anything else?
[318:19.20]Whatever, I missed out.
[318:21.66]He's gone.
[318:24.11]Alright.
[318:24.61]Now I can do the thing I want to do.
[318:28.55]What's that?
[318:28.93]Ooh.
[318:31.06]Get rid of this rock floor.
[318:31.80]Give me that.
[318:32.32]Don't let anybody touch that.
[318:33.06]Get away from me.
[318:33.88]Oh, fuck you.
[318:36.78]Yep.
[318:41.54]Everyone's in the way.
[318:44.23]Go ahead.
[318:44.73]Eat each other.
[318:47.89]Alright.
[318:48.09]I got what I wanted.
[318:54.69]I gotta, I gotta get food.
[318:57.09]Where's the, uh, there was some chickens down here.
[319:01.03]Where are they?
[319:08.72]Chickens, chickens, chickens, chickens.
[319:10.16]There you are.
[319:15.06]If another one of those comes out, I want to see what happens.
[319:16.76]Okay.
[319:21.10]Get the water and run for it.
[319:23.37]Nope.
[319:40.85]There's another one.
[319:41.39]Okay, feed.
[319:45.25]Holy shit.
[319:45.93]He just exploded.
[319:48.11]Come here.
[319:48.37]Come here.
[319:48.59]Back here.
[319:52.12]More money.
[319:52.64]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[319:53.52]Back, back.
[319:53.88]Come back here.
[319:54.54]Come back here.
[319:55.38]Oh.
[320:00.38]Well, okay.
[320:02.48]I did get mosaic.
[320:03.20]That's pretty, probably pretty rare.
[320:04.52]I didn't even know what that thing did.
[320:08.35]I've never fed that before.
[320:13.31]I fed him once and he exploded.
[320:16.05]That's really cool though.
[320:16.73]I like that.
[320:17.09]Alright, I want to do mosaic stuff.
[320:23.11]Time for me to get out of here.
[320:24.62]Let's use... Let's just run.
[320:27.10]I want to do mosaic.
[320:32.24]Crystal.
[320:33.57]Crystal.
[320:44.43]What do mosaics eat?
[320:50.13]He sounds like he wants to do another stream of this.
[320:51.98]You know, there's probably enough there to do it.
[320:59.16]But, you know, I'm... If I don't play another... If I don't play a game for a week, you'll never see it again.
[321:07.40]Right?
[321:09.08]It's just the way it is.
[321:09.97]That's the way it's always been.
[321:13.87]If I get into GTA RP next week, I'm not going to play this.
[321:23.41]And then that'll be one week.
[321:26.21]And then it's just gone in my mind completely.
[321:27.91]What about Yakuza?
[321:38.33]I do have to play Yakuza because they won in the Rumble.
[321:41.94]That's true.
[321:49.47]Alright.
[321:50.80]Teleport back.
[321:51.84]Let's check out these slimes and then we're going to call it there.
[322:03.30]You said it was going to happen in like June or July.
[322:05.53]I did?
[322:05.89]That's so long.
[322:10.23]That is so long from now.
[322:11.65]That's not even funny.
[322:14.33]Alright, here we go.
[322:15.89]Mosaic slime.
[322:17.74]I'm going to put you in here.
[322:20.22]What do you like?
[322:20.86]Veggies.
[322:21.46]Ooh, they're so pretty.
[322:22.14]Okay, let's feed a veggie and let's start the process here.
[322:26.18]I'm curious.
[322:31.95]What's your favorite veggie, though?
[322:33.23]That's important.
[322:40.84]Silver parsnip.
[322:41.86]Well, I don't have any of those.
[322:51.49]Okay, let's do slime wind.
[322:59.03]Well, it doesn't matter what his favorite food is because he's going to be combined with... Why are they angry?
[323:10.15]Oh, fuck.
[323:10.46]There's no food left.
[323:11.06]Uh...
[323:25.40]What the fuck just happened?
[323:26.66]Holy shit!
[323:27.66]What happened to that guy?
[323:42.89]No!

[324:01.14]Where are my bees?
[324:02.28]What the fuck are the bees doing?
[324:03.82]What are you doing?
[324:05.50]Get off!
[324:09.60]I am mad about that.
[324:11.50]Absolutely.

[324:50.40]Alright, I'm going for it.
[324:52.58]Here we go.
[324:53.02]Mosaic slime going in.
[325:04.49]Let's make some slimes.
[325:07.91]You guys alright?
[325:13.93]And do it.
[325:15.53]Wow.
[325:16.26]Really cool.

[325:46.29]We're gonna turn them all.
[325:48.31]Who exploded?
[325:56.41]Who's fucking raining hell down here?
[325:58.50]What's going on?
[326:07.20]What are you doing over here?
[326:09.92]How did you get all the way over here?
[326:12.34]They attract other slimes.
[326:23.68]sparkles make fire does that hurt them these really are so pretty
[326:51.64]There's too many in here.
[326:53.58]Oh shit.
[327:05.67]Solar roof, solar roof, solar roof.
[327:16.23]Whoa.
[327:18.13]That looks really cool.
[327:18.89]Alright, I gotta sell.
[327:19.56]Why are they so angry?
[327:34.06]Why are they so angry?
[327:35.28]What's going on?
[327:35.82]Why are you so angry?
[327:37.20]Get over here, you fucking little weirdo.
[327:39.67]You weirdos.
[327:40.53]What's going on?
[327:41.05]Why are you so hungry?
[327:41.83]Why are they so hungry?
[327:43.31]I need fruit.
[327:55.66]Ah, it's fruit.
[327:57.00]This way.
[328:21.13]This is my last fucking failed experiment.
[328:24.67]I gotta go, hurry.
[328:26.31]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[328:28.08]I come back to the planet every once in a while to get the groceries and I leave.
[328:31.94]Ow!
[328:48.31]Whatever.
[328:48.73]I'll see you.
[328:49.85]I'm done.
[328:51.07]That's game over.
[328:51.61]I'm just going to sell some of these because I want to see how cool it looks.
[328:57.18]It's over for the fire guys.
[328:58.62]I'm sorry.
[328:59.14]They're so cute.
[329:01.14]No, he's okay.
[329:02.40]He's okay.
[329:02.80]He's okay.
[329:03.16]He's okay.
[329:04.34]Pick him up.
[329:05.64]Pick him up.
[329:06.04]Let him in.
[329:06.56]Oh my god.
[329:07.44]He's okay.
[329:17.35]Get
[329:18.21]inside of here why does this have to be so difficult it just is like I why is this so hard to make them stay in here you guys settling down this thing is very intimidating
[329:56.29]Wow, they're like prismatic.
[330:03.47]Cool.
[330:04.11]Alright, what do they sell for?
[330:05.37]Let's get some money.
[330:09.27]No, just for fun.
[330:10.65]Just for fun.
[330:12.69]Let's do, let's make like mosaic cat.
[330:15.16]Why not?
[330:15.74]I'm done.
[330:18.36]This game is really fun.
[330:19.62]I'm going to make a mosaic cat for fun.
[330:28.77]Or mosaic rock.
[330:36.19]A guitar farm.
[330:39.21]I think that's too involved.
[330:40.02]Stream's going to be over here in a minute.
[330:44.17]OK, let's make a mosaic cat.
[330:49.12]Ooh.
[330:51.30]Cool.
[330:55.96]Thanks for the kiss.
[331:13.70]Cool.
[331:14.38]Alright, now these are mine.
[331:18.44]Sell.
[331:26.81]It's just kind of hell.
[331:28.18]That looks really cool.
[331:29.16]Look at those sparkles.
[331:31.12]Very sparkly.
[331:34.84]I love it.
[331:36.85]Very, very cool.
[331:37.39]Let's sell these and then I'm going to... I'm going to call it here.
[331:42.26]70, 80 bucks each.
[331:43.00]Nice.
[331:54.92]Free the whole ranch.
[331:56.62]Uh, no, no.
[331:57.42]Because if I play off stream for any reason... I don't want to just destroy the save file.
[332:04.35]I mean, obviously put...
[332:07.65]What, like 17, 18 hours into the game so far?
[332:10.51]I don't think I want to just delete it.
[332:11.85]That was really cool.
[332:15.65]Very, very good.
[332:17.21]This game, I'm going to give it a rating.
[332:18.95]Here you go.
[332:19.45]Everyone wants me to rate games.
[332:20.61]Sure.
[332:21.99]This game is a... Hmm.
[332:32.92]Hmm.
[332:37.35]That's way higher than a seven.
[332:54.54]It's much higher than 7.5.
[332:56.30]I don't think this, I don't know.
[333:00.14]I'm not sure this is quite, I'm not sure this is quite 9.0 territory.
[333:05.83]Might be.
[333:11.70]It might be.
[333:22.20]Eight.
[333:24.11]Point.
[333:27.81]Seven.
[333:28.65]Done.
[333:31.59]This is an 8.7.
[333:34.64]Very, very, very, very.
[333:35.72]It's very, very good.
[333:36.44]I would say this is probably one of the best games that came out in 2015.
[333:43.05]Elaborate on that.
[334:00.62]How much more do you want me to elaborate?
[334:02.20]That's not when it came out.
[334:04.90]B+, best game of 2015.
[334:05.80]What else came out in 2015 that you liked?
[334:09.14]This is an 8.7.
[334:17.49]What have you rated 10 out of 10?
[334:18.89]Just curious.
[334:24.33]Bloodborne's like a 9.7 for me.
[334:25.93]9.8.
[334:26.09]I mean, no, 9.
[334:28.83]Yeah, 9.7 because the points where he's taking off for that stupid ass swamp level.
[334:39.47]Undertale is 2015.
[334:40.03]That's a pretty good year.
[334:44.53]I thought it was your favorite game.
[334:49.53]How is it not a 10?
[334:53.17]Well.
[334:54.83]Because.
[334:55.27]10 just seems too easy to give something.
[335:01.28]Nothing is perfect.
[335:05.14]Nothing is perfect.
[335:11.80]I have not come across a game that I thought was perfect.
[335:18.42]That has not happened yet.
[335:20.32]Well, hold on.
[335:21.74]Hold on.
[335:23.77]Team Fortress 2 might... Might be close to perfect.
[335:30.55]Wait, hold on.
[335:31.71]TF2... TF2, like, circa 2014.
[335:35.88]Like, 2013.
[335:36.14]TF2 2013...
[335:43.46]It could be close to a perfect video game.
[335:50.68]If I would have to give TF2 a 9.9, I don't, I mean, that seems so stupid to say that, but it's probably a 9.9.
[336:00.25]And I'm trying to think of the reasons of why.
[336:05.73]And I think for the most part,
[336:12.13]It was based around, oh, some of the little things that irritated you about TF2.
[336:18.46]You gave Spore an 8-7.
[336:27.24]Did?
[336:27.68]No, I didn't.
[336:32.62]Spore's an 8-5.
[336:34.24]Sorry, underneath this.
[336:39.91]You think sacrificing TF2 for Alex was a fair trade-off?
[336:42.23]I don't think they sacrificed TF2 for Alex.
[336:43.91]They stopped really caring about TF2 way before Alex was a thing.
[336:56.50]Spore is like a 7?
[336:57.42]No, I didn't give Spore a 3.5.
[337:01.21]I gave the Civilization phase a 3.5.
[337:03.07]I gave the Creature Creator a 9.
[337:07.08]I gave the space like an 8, or like a 7, and then I gave the tribal stage like a 7.
[337:12.22]4 is a 9.8.
[337:22.89]Eh, I don't know about that.
[337:25.29]Space is an 8?
[337:25.97]No, space is like a 4.
[337:32.98]That adds up to more than 10.
[337:34.79]I'm rating the different portions of the game as 0 out of 10.
[337:39.21]I do that shit.
[337:42.07]That's how we do this on this stream.
[337:44.32]Remember Resident Evil 7?
[337:48.10]I base it on time and portions of games.
[337:52.29]Different areas.
[337:53.39]Different acts.
[337:55.81]What act are we in, and how shitty was this?
[337:58.18]Resident Evil 7's first act was a 9.4 out of 10.
[338:02.78]Resident Evil's second act was like a 7, and Resident Evil's third act was like a 2.
[338:09.28]Resident Evil 7's third act is a literal fucking almost a 1 out of 10.
[338:12.09]The first act is a fucking 9.4, 9.5.
[338:21.45]So, I mean, overall, you think about, okay, how much, and how are you weighting the third act?
[338:28.22]What's the weight of the third act?
[338:31.32]What percentage is that weight?
[338:32.84]I think I ended up giving Resident Evil 7, like, an 8.2 or something?
[338:44.21]How good is the forest versus indigo quarry versus desert versus ancient ruins?
[338:47.79]Okay, now here's the problem.
[338:50.55]Ancient Ruins, you heard me flip out a little bit.
[338:52.45]I thought that was a fucking 4 out of 10.
[338:55.26]I don't like that place.
[338:59.00]These first two areas, 9.7, 8.6.
[339:03.74]Then that third area with the caves and the crystals and the cave system, that's like an 8.4.
[339:15.19]So I weight that Ancient Ruins part.
[339:19.13]That's like 10% weight.
[339:20.37]That's not like a full 20-30% weight.
[339:24.17]Absolutely not.
[339:29.86]I could overlook it.
[339:30.52]It's alright.
[339:30.98]I wasn't a big fan of the Ancient Ruins place.
[339:33.22]I like the place after that, the Crystal Place.
[339:38.64]The part where you're on the boat in Resident Evil 7... I thought was just stupid.
[339:45.86]And I weighted it kind of high.
[339:47.04]Because it kind of ruined the game for me.
[339:57.84]What would you give Stardew?
[339:59.57]It's at least a 9.
[340:01.13]Stardew's probably like a... Ugh.
[340:05.23]Stardew's... That's pretty... That's close.
[340:09.41]Stardew's really close to being perfect as well.
[340:11.71]It is.
[340:15.99]Is it weird of me to... Oh, no.
[340:17.59]That's so unfair.
[340:21.12]That's very close.
[340:21.68]It's probably like a 9-8.
[340:22.16]Oh, man.
[340:26.42]Stardew Valley might be perfect.
[340:35.16]Hmm.
[340:38.89]What was wrong with Stardew Valley that I didn't like?
[340:45.27]I don't know if I can think of anything.
[340:46.49]That might be a perfect video game.
[340:52.53]But is Stardew Valley better than Bloodborne?
[340:55.88]Oh, shit.
[340:59.18]Bloodborne is at 30 FPS, PS4 exclusive.
[341:03.60]Has some technical problems.
[341:05.76]Ran like shit in some areas.
[341:09.38]And there's one or two areas in Bloodborne that I wasn't a huge fan of.
[341:15.89]Stardew Valley is... Oh, man.
[341:20.37]I don't know.
[341:20.86]Stardew Valley might be a 10.
[341:25.48]It could be.
[341:25.96]I don't know if I'm willing to give it that score, though.
[341:36.31]Combat's not good in Stardew.
[341:37.79]Yeah, but that's like extra stuff.
[341:41.71]Damn.
[341:42.15]Hmm.
[341:43.70]There's such different games.
[341:44.80]I know.
[341:45.44]They are.
[341:46.02]Star of... No, Star of El is a 9.8.
[341:47.24]It's a 9.8.
[341:52.73]TF2 is a 9.9.
[341:53.93]Star of El is a 9.8.
[341:55.05]Bloodborne's a 9.7.
[341:55.49]There you go.
[342:00.30]Diablo II?
[342:00.86]9.9.
[342:01.36]No, it's not.
[342:03.56]That game's like... At its very core, that game is like a 7.4.
[342:13.56]But the fun factor of Diablo II is like a 50.
[342:20.57]The fun factor of Diablo II, way higher than a 7.4.
[342:27.31]At least it's a 10.
[342:27.83]One of the most fun I've ever had playing a video game was Diablo II.
[342:35.75]What, Hades?
[342:37.79]Hades is a... Hades is like a 9.2.
[342:41.09]That's a 9.2.
[342:44.63]I don't know if I'd call it perfect.
[342:47.19]It's like probably 9.2, 9.3.
[342:49.75]That's too high?
[342:50.43]I don't think it is.
[342:50.97]No, I don't think it is.
[342:51.65]9.2 is pretty high.
[342:52.95]But it is.
[342:54.09]You gave Saw an 8.9.
[342:55.37]No, I gave Outer Wilds an 8.9.
[343:00.80]And half of you wanted to kill me.
[343:08.86]You guys want me to give you my scores for video games, but if I don't do a high enough score for your favorite video game...
[343:15.50]You want me to, like, drink poison?
[343:23.22]This dude's an 8.8 Eugene.
[343:26.06]8.7 Andy.
[343:26.68]I don't give everything an 8.7 or an 8.8.
[343:28.77]I just told you three games right there that were a 9.9, 9.8, and 9.7.
[343:36.75]7.8 Andy.
[343:37.03]What other games have I given a 7.8?
[343:50.07]Sniper Elite 3?
[343:52.01]Um, maybe like a 5.5?
[344:01.95]Didn't I play that game for like two or three hours and I just said this game's not fun and I stopped?
[344:10.60]Rate the World of Warcraft expansions.
[344:13.73]uh wrath of the lich king is is okay well this is just in the universe of World of Warcraft this is not in like the actual universe of all video games that I've ever played this is just bracket put in brackets World of Warcraft corralled in one spot wrath of the lich king is a 10. burning crusade is a 9.7 legion is a 9.5 and then everything else is a zero
[344:50.36]That's it.
[344:58.44]You love the latest expansion.
[345:02.08]Well, actually, hold on, hold on.
[345:04.08]Mists of Pandaria.
[345:05.18]Okay, hold on.
[345:05.86]Mists of Pandaria was like a six.
[345:09.31]Everything else is zero.
[345:11.61]I played Mists of Pandaria.
[345:13.39]It was okay.
[345:22.26]We're just still going here.
[345:23.30]I'm not even playing the game.
[345:24.24]I'm just talking.
[345:27.93]Let's get to the end here.
[345:29.01]We can still talk, but let's do the credits.
[345:33.83]You're just meandering around the ranch.
[345:35.93]I know.
[345:37.93]But we can keep talking while we see the credits.
[345:41.78]Thanks for the subs.
[345:42.56]Sorry I missed a bunch of them.
[345:44.24]It was a huge 50 community sub drop.
[345:47.56]I must have been screaming at the TV.
[345:56.56]What about Jedi Academy?
[345:57.88]Um, comedy factor was like a 10.
[346:00.50]Video game factor was like a 7.4.
[346:03.72]Maybe even lower, like a 6.8.
[346:04.86]What would you rate Fistful of Frags?
[346:17.73]A solid 8.0.
[346:18.55]And I know that's a joke of a score, but it just is.
[346:22.47]That's a fact.
[346:28.94]Now that's an 8.5.
[346:29.60]It is.
[346:31.04]I had so much fun playing that game.
[346:33.08]You know how desperately I wanted someone to make A Fistful of Frags into a full non-mod video game?
[346:40.03]Where it was just a full AAA video game of that caliber.
[346:45.39]Ugh.
[346:48.70]Too bad.
[346:49.02]I would love it.
[346:52.42]Red Dead Redemption 2.
[346:53.40]No, but Red Dead Redemption 2 was not an FPS multiplayer shooter.
[346:58.81]It would have been really good, I know.
[347:08.74]Rate Days Gone and Jump King.
[347:11.28]Days Gone is a 4.
[347:12.80]Jump King is a... 7.9.
[347:27.09]What would you rate the last Whopper?
[347:28.41]Probably a 5 or a 6.
[347:33.69]Portal 2, stop ignoring me.
[347:36.86]Portal 2, when it came out, I think was like a 9.4.
[347:41.32]But Portal 2, kind of 5, 10 years later, I almost look back and it may have been too high.
[347:56.21]Maybe, like, if I were to go back and think about it, without the, like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing I've ever played in my entire life.
[348:01.73]Maybe, like, Portals... I haven't played it in a long time.
[348:08.04]I would probably say it would probably be, like, a 9.2.
[348:09.56]9.3.
[348:11.02]I think it should be docked.
[348:13.34]Like, 0.1 or 0.2 points.
[348:16.91]I had just, I had just, I was so excited for it that I just clouded my face.
[348:21.84]Clouded my face.
[348:23.88]I gave it like a 9.5.
[348:24.48]It's probably like a 9.3.
[348:25.98]What about Tetris?
[348:26.44]I, no.
[348:45.73]The reason why I can't rate the Portal games like 10s like everybody else does.
[348:49.25]Because those games made me sick.
[348:52.53]I powered through playing Portal 1 and Portal 2.
[348:55.83]And it's like, this is so much fun.
[348:58.37]This is the funnest thing I've ever done.
[349:00.23]I love this game.
[349:01.08]It's so good.
[349:04.24]I had to lie down every couple of hours.
[349:07.00]I couldn't play that game for more than an hour or two.
[349:08.38]I had to go actually physically lie down or I'd throw up at my desk.
[349:12.97]So I can't give it a 10.
[349:14.37]It made me almost throw up five times.
[349:16.81]So it's a 9.2.
[349:17.65]How do you play VR?
[349:31.93]Well, VR is a lot different.
[349:33.31]You have a full, you have a full, essentially 183 60 degrees of vision.
[349:38.96]It's the looking through the portals and moving around through the portals and jumping through them and doing the speed thing where you run and then through another.
[349:48.12]The world kind of turns sometimes in portal.
[349:50.50]Here's the worst part about it.
[349:52.02]Sometimes in portal, when you go through a portal and your camera flips upside down and right side up because you went through backwards or something and it's like you flip forward.
[350:01.23]That would kill me every time.
[350:15.27]motion sick ridiculously easy I wouldn't say ridiculously easy but like enough where I it can be an issue sorry what about Noita Noita was not really my kind of game I would say Terraria was not my kind of game either and I put them in the same category I love what Terraria does and I like that Terraria is cool and I think it's a really fun experience but I don't know if I would rate Terraria that high
[350:44.20]It would probably be pretty low for me.
[350:45.28]They're not the same.
[350:48.70]Well, they're played very similarly.
[350:51.52]They're not the same exact game.
[351:02.11]I think they're really cool.
[351:02.93]They're just kind of not the type of game that I like to play.
[351:11.84]What about Super Mario Bros. 3?
[351:17.15]Wait, there's a game ratings wiki page of mine?
[351:21.87]What?
[351:23.41]No, there's not.
[351:24.39]Hold on a second.
[351:28.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[351:31.80]Why is Among Us up here as a 10?
[351:35.48]Somebody's doing bullshit editing here.
[351:45.71]That shouldn't be up there.
[351:47.67]Why is Whopper on here?
[351:50.16]Whopper is not a game.
[351:57.46]And Art of Wilds is not even right either.
[351:59.92]Wait, didn't I retroactively went back and gave Art of Wilds a 9.1 because I cracked under the pressure Andy, right?
[352:12.72]It was an 8.9.
[352:19.08]Binding of Isaac?
[352:19.90]Binding of Isaac is a 9.
[352:22.08]Binding of Isaac is a 9.0.
[352:25.26]Get that Among Us a fucking 10.
[352:28.04]No.
[352:29.50]Even if I played Among Us, I probably wouldn't think it was that good of a game.
[352:33.16]Even if I played it.
[352:35.44]Not a 10.
[352:38.60]Even if I was a big fan of Among Us, I wouldn't give it a 10.
[352:42.01]I don't know.
[352:44.05]I haven't played it, so I can't give you a rating.
[352:47.53]Refresh.
[352:57.13]Where is it?
[353:00.90]Somebody linked it to me again.
[353:01.54]I don't know why I can't get back to it.
[353:02.44]Stop ignoring Hollow Knight.
[353:07.80]Hollow Knight is probably like a... I can't give it a full... I didn't finish it.
[353:11.36]I feel like I would need to... That's the kind of game that you need to finish before you give it a real rating.
[353:14.98]Binding of Isaac 9.0.
[353:19.37]Bugsnax 7.95.
[353:19.61]Why 9.5?
[353:27.17]Jerma won't write Black and White 2.
[353:28.67]Feels bad, man.
[353:29.41]Hi, Jerma.
[353:29.87]Lots of love from the Navy.
[353:31.19]Well, thanks.
[353:32.65]Black and White 2, um... Which one was better?
[353:36.49]Black and White 1 was better than Black and White 2, wasn't it?
[353:39.01]I forget.
[353:39.69]Flip it around, maybe?
[353:43.91]Black and White 2 was an 8.3.
[353:46.40]Black and White 1 was like an 8.6.
[353:48.42]Flip it somewhere around.
[353:49.42]I forget which one was better.
[354:05.80]Phasmophobia.
[354:07.94]7.
[354:09.55]7.1.
[354:09.71]No, just 7.0.
[354:12.37]Dark Souls 3.
[354:20.72]Dead Rising.
[354:22.02]Okay, Dead Rising's... Dead Rising's probably like a... Dead Rising's probably an 8.2.
[354:35.63]No, it's not.
[354:36.11]It's higher than that.
[354:36.91]It's an 8.6.
[354:38.55]8.5.
[354:38.73]Dead Rising is an 8.5.
[354:39.75]Dead Rising 2 is an 8.5.
[354:40.97]I don't know.
[354:41.75]I don't rate video games.
[354:43.77]I just play them and think they're fun sometimes.
[354:45.58]Or I think they suck.
[354:46.90]Or I don't like them.
[354:47.66]I don't know.
[354:48.16]I can't rate video games.
[354:51.50]Sekiro.
[354:52.54]Oh, Sekiro.
[354:52.92]I'm going to piss a lot of people off with Sekiro.
[354:55.42]Sekiro is the worst Souls kind of like video game.
[354:58.62]It's the worst one.
[355:00.44]I think I gave it like a 9.
[355:01.50]I was lying.
[355:04.52]I gave it a 9.
[355:05.62]I was a liar.
[355:06.33]I was like, you know, it's like a 9.0.
[355:09.95]I think after I finished it, I said that.
[355:11.93]I think that might be the worst one.
[355:14.31]No, Dark Souls 2 is way worse.
[355:15.45]Never mind.
[355:16.39]Okay, I need to... How many games have they made?
[355:18.54]FromSoftware.
[355:24.20]Hold on.
[355:31.80]Okay.
[355:33.12]Yeah, Dark Souls 2 is worse than... Okay, here we go.
[355:36.22]Dark Souls 2 is worse than Sekiro.
[355:40.54]Dark Souls 2 is like a 6.5.
[355:41.58]Sekiro is like a 7.6.
[355:43.89]Dark Souls 3 is like an 8.1.
[355:44.73]No, it's not.
[355:45.23]It's an 8.1.
[356:02.44]Dark Souls 1 is an 8.5.
[356:03.78]No, it's not.
[356:05.50]It's higher than that.
[356:06.72]8.8.
[356:08.50]Bloodborne is a 9.7.
[356:10.58]I don't even remember what they were.
[356:17.92]Honestly, I think I just said random numbers there.
[356:26.83]No, let me get this right.
[356:27.83]All the Dark Souls games besides Dark Souls 2 are 8s.
[356:32.01]I think.
[356:32.73]Yes, that's accurate.
[356:34.66]I got all jumbled up here.
[356:36.24]Dark Souls 2 is a 6.5.
[356:36.82]Sekiro is a 7.9.
[356:37.20]Dark Souls 3, 8.5.
[356:38.08]Dark Souls 1, 8.9.
[356:38.60]Darks... Bloodborne, 9.7.
[356:39.20]Done.
[356:39.38]Was that what I said?
[356:42.02]Twilight Princess.
[356:42.86]I didn't finish it.
[356:43.56]These are getting updated.
[357:02.96]What about Left 4 Dead 2?
[357:04.50]Who cares?
[357:06.91]You don't need my opinion on this.
[357:08.89]You've already played like a thousand hours of that game.
[357:11.27]You want me to tell you what I think about Left 4 Dead 2?
[357:20.59]We both have probably one to two thousand hours in Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.
[357:24.15]I don't think it really matters what I think at this point.
[357:30.05]It's great.
[357:30.77]It was very, very good.
[357:42.23]Chibi-Robo 9.9 uh 9.0 days gone is a four on here oh it's almost six hours you're right he's obsessed no more heroes one and two no more heroes the games are kind of bad but in a really really charming good way
[358:08.69]I think both No More Heroes games are like 7-1 and like 7-4.
[358:14.97]That's not really bad.
[358:26.72]Refresh the page.
[358:32.18]I don't think Spore is an 8-5.
[358:34.23]Oh, but when it came out, it was revolutionary.
[358:36.57]Left 4 Dead 2 is who cares.
[358:45.35]I mean, but really though, it's like so... Everybody played that game.
[358:49.44]It was shitload.
[358:50.02]Does it matter?
[358:50.48]Alright, I'm only gonna rate three more games.
[358:58.26]Watch Dogs Legion.
[359:00.14]Watch Dogs Legion, realistically, was a 4.6.
[359:02.64]That game sucks.
[359:10.21]And I'm not afraid to say it.
[359:17.32]Was it better than Days Gone?
[359:18.90]You know, it might actually be worse than Days Gone.
[359:25.20]What is Days Gone a 4?
[359:26.58]If that's a caliber for a 4, Watch Dogs Legion is a 3.6.
[359:29.36]That's only because your computer sucks.
[359:40.87]That was my experience with Watch Dogs Legion.
[359:43.03]It's got a 3.6.
[359:50.14]House Flipper.
[359:50.70]House Flipper's an 8.4.
[359:58.36]If I'm going to be realistic about it.
[360:01.94]One more.
[360:10.35]Skyrim.
[360:11.39]I can't rate Skyrim.
[360:14.21]I played two or three hours of Skyrim.
[360:18.65]modded the hell out of it made a bunch of monsters never played it again and then watched it re-release 15 times I can't give you a rating that's not rateable for me Hotline Miami Hotline Miami one is an eight point nine Hotline Miami two is a seven
[360:57.23]Rhythm Heaven.
[360:57.81]8.
[360:57.83]8.5.
[361:05.54]GTA 5.
[361:18.13]9.5.
[361:18.43]No, it's not.
[361:18.93]It's a 9 point.
[361:19.61]Yeah, it is.
[361:20.59]9.5.
[361:29.57]Gotcha Force.
[361:30.17]The game is probably like a 5.6.
[361:31.30]But I loved it so much that it raises it up in brackets.
[361:37.22]It's a 7.6.
[361:37.44]It's a 5.6 video game, but in brackets it's a 7.6.
[361:51.81]Outer Wilds, 8.9.
[361:52.41]And then in brackets, 9.1.
[362:00.43]Refresh the page.
[362:01.53]The page is deleted.
[362:02.83]There's nothing even here.
[362:05.78]Somebody deleted it all.
[362:06.86]What the fuck?
[362:09.96]It's gone.
[362:16.20]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[362:17.44]Goodbye, goodnight.
[362:18.24]I gotta go.
[362:21.06]The next time you see me will be... I will be back on Monday.
[362:31.06]Yeah, Monday.
[362:32.28]I'll be back on Monday.
[362:35.08]What time on Monday though?
[362:37.30]Monday might be a later stream.
[362:42.84]We'll see.
[362:43.32]Maybe.
[362:43.70]I gotta figure this out.
[362:44.81]Either Monday or... I... I think I have an appointment on Monday.
[362:56.23]We'll see.
[362:56.67]Check the sus.
[362:57.25]It's either Monday or Tuesday.
[362:58.29]Let's see if I can stream on Monday late.
[363:00.93]If not, then Tuesday afternoon.
[363:05.05]Great sorcery.
[363:05.69]9... Sorcery 1.
[363:06.17]9.0.
[363:07.57]Sorcery 2. 9.0.
[363:12.41]9.8.
[363:13.57]Sorcery 3, 7.5.
[363:16.46]Sorcery 4, 6.8.
[363:20.90]Combine them all together, Sorcery 2 makes up most of the game.
[363:27.52]As a whole, remember, we weight them differently here.
[363:29.72]We weight them differently.
[363:33.24]I put like 75% weight into Sorcery 2.
[363:36.78]The rest of them just trickle in.
[363:52.09]Wait, W-E-I-G-H-T.
[363:57.90]Go to bed, Jeremy.
[363:58.96]I mean, it's not that late.
[364:01.24]Great Among Us.
[364:02.00]I can't rate it.
[364:03.32]N slash A. Not applicable.
[364:05.16]I have not played it.
[364:06.87]Jewel Wizardry.
[364:07.85]I mean... 2.
[364:10.11]That game is a 2.
[364:12.37]Not even.
[364:12.65]It's a 1.4.
[364:15.96]Super Frog.
[364:17.10]Super Frog is a... A 1.
[364:22.94]But in brackets, 9.5.
[364:34.61]Undertale.
[364:35.50]Oh boy.
[364:35.94]Oh boy.
[364:38.24]I'm about to rate Undertale.
[364:41.58]This is where... This is where I'm gonna... This is a MonkaS scenario, I think.
[364:48.03]Undertale.
[364:48.55]Uh-oh.
[364:53.77]If I gave Outer Wilds an 8.9 and I don't give Undertale a 9.0...
[365:02.57]Undertale is definitely not... This is a career-ending statement, possibly.
[365:16.26]It's a 9.
[365:17.02]It's at least a 9.
[365:18.68]But I don't know if it's the 9 that you think it is. ...
[365:37.48]uh it's Undertale for me was a nine point nine point two six five not quite a nine point three but it's almost there
[366:06.55]And then in brackets for Undertale, 0.51.
[366:10.29]9.265 is locked in.
[366:27.10]What about the brackets?
[366:28.06]The brackets are very important.
[366:39.74]And the 0.51 gets added to the score.
[366:41.88]No, no, no.
[366:42.82]Don't put the brackets there.
[366:45.59]What?
[366:45.79]No, no, no.
[366:46.11]Okay.
[366:46.39]What's the... Somebody do the math.
[366:48.73]What's the math?
[366:50.57]So it was 9 point... Okay.
[366:53.75]I need to calculate it.
[366:55.13]9 point... 9.6... 9.265... Plus... 0.51...
[367:08.02]So, in brackets, Undertale is a nine point... That's not accurate.
[367:12.97]No, no, no.
[367:13.61]Hold on.
[367:15.73]It would be point... Alright, in brackets, it's a nine point three two zero.
[367:22.74]Nine point three two zero.
[367:31.24]Nine point three two zero in the brackets.
[367:38.67]I have to go.
[367:39.33]Alright, well, we're going.
[367:46.17]Brackets are for multiplying.
[367:47.22]No, brackets are for, that could be the score, too.
[367:50.90]On a given day, however, I might feel like giving it that one.
[367:54.02]I have to give two scores sometimes.
[367:55.80]Because on a given moment, it could range between those two.
[367:58.87]It could be one of the, it could be one or the other.
[368:03.40]Alright, goodnight.
[368:03.98]Goodbye.
[368:04.40]I'll see you later.
[368:05.04]I'll see you on Monday or Tuesday.
[368:06.04]Have a great weekend, everybody.
[368:07.14]Take care of yourselves.
[368:08.58]Thanks for sticking around.
[368:09.18]Thanks for watching, as always.
[368:11.26]See you soon.
[368:12.70]Goodnight.
[368:13.54]Goodbye.
[368:17.27]Write your channel.
[368:17.97]9.85 Bye-bye.
[368:22.41]Bye-bye.
[368:24.79]Bye-bye.
[368:25.91]Bye-bye.
