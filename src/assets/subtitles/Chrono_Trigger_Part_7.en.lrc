[00:39.21]I screwed this up.
[00:47.19]There we go.
[00:52.69]There it is.
[00:53.59]Alright.
[00:55.81]Last thing we did.
[00:56.57]I think it's very possible that we will see the credits today.
[01:04.72]We're at the final arc of the game.
[01:06.40]Welcome back.
[01:09.22]And we're starting this pretty early, so I... I think... I think I'm locking in today.
[01:14.42]And, uh... I'm going until this is done.
[01:16.31]We're locking it in.
[01:25.71]Alright.
[01:27.78]I just got access to this.
[01:33.66]and we need to find chrono what was the last thing we just did we fought dalton we got the epoch just got it back I think we have to go to a different time period don't we oh no no chrono we have to go maybe up here
[02:06.67]Yeah, okay, here we go.
[02:13.05]Okay.
[02:14.97]So it's you.
[02:17.90]Magus!
[02:20.48]Behold, all of it rests at the bottom of the sea.
[02:25.44]Gone is the magical kingdom of Zeal and all the dreams and ambitions of its people.
[02:31.99]I lived there once, but I was another person then.
[02:38.26]But... but...
[03:16.80]It... It's a... A... A... A... A time... Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[03:46.97]Where the fuck am I?
[03:47.93]Where the fuck am I?
[03:51.21]Where the fuck am I?
[03:53.81]What is this place?
[03:56.01]Hello?
[03:59.01]There's no one here.
[04:01.27]Is this the end of time?
[04:16.64]You?
[04:18.40]You were that boy?
[04:19.52]I've lived only for the thought of slaying Lavos, ever since his rift in time's fabric stranded me in the Middle Ages.
[04:31.14]And just as I had summoned him to my castle, you arrived to interfere.
[04:36.29]To think I would be drawn through yet another portal, only to find myself returned to this age.
[04:42.95]Ironic, is it not?
[04:44.85]Being from the future, my knowledge of the past enabled me to convince the queen that I was an oracle of no small power.
[04:52.06]And so again I worked to draw the beast out.
[04:55.24]But no history book could have prepared me for what ensued.
[04:59.14]Unimaginable is the power of Lavos.
[05:02.86]Before him all are as leaves cast of the bitter winds that howl about death's black winds.
[05:08.41]Stay this course and your fate will be the same as that fool Cronos.
[05:11.53]Okay.
[05:13.59]So.
[05:13.69]Uh... If I say yes... We kill him.
[05:43.04]and you get a crazy item.
[05:45.72]If I say no... we'll see what happens.
[05:56.61]I'm gonna let you guys decide.
[06:02.33]Do we kill Magus or do we not kill Magus?
[06:08.13]No is very interesting and I forget what kill Magus is.
[06:13.34]But I'm gonna let you guys pick, because it's- it's... You could probably guess what happens if I say no.
[06:33.05]No is the boring answer?
[06:36.91]Well, no is the answer that, uh... I mean, it's- it's- this is not even close.
[06:43.89]73%.
[06:44.05]It's gonna be a no.
[06:50.14]Uh, we'll see what happens.
[06:54.94]Taking your life will not restore Chrono or Cyrus theirs.
[07:01.00]Hmm.
[07:13.37]Good luck to you.
[07:16.31]Wait.
[07:21.63]I'll accompany you.
[07:23.93]Are you mad?
[07:25.91]I said the fool was dead.
[07:27.03]I did not say his death could not be undone.
[07:30.83]What?
[07:31.37]Of what do you speak?
[07:34.14]Gaspar, the guru of time, knows the way to restore those streams of time that have been diverted from their proper courses.
[07:43.90]Magus has joined the party.
[07:56.23]So, Magus is crazy.
[07:59.73]Magus has a shitload of magic.
[08:03.78]I think I would, I don't know.
[08:07.62]I like Robo, but I think it's going to be Frog Magus Isla.
[08:18.31]Sorry, Robo.
[08:21.13]Or what about Robo Magus Isla?
[08:23.22]That is a goofy party.
[08:25.10]I don't think people do this very much.
[08:35.38]Does he have a triple with anybody?
[08:39.02]He does.
[08:50.23]Frog Magus Isla is triple.
[08:53.47]I'm curious about it.
[08:54.19]I've never seen it before.
[08:55.53]Let's do it.
[08:55.89]This is the official party.
[08:59.81]Take a look at his moves, though.
[09:00.69]They're kind of crazy.
[09:02.09]He has Lightning 2, Ice 2, Fire 2, and then Dark Bomb.
[09:08.94]Robo Magus Isla is probably the weirdest party composition cannon-wise.
[09:18.04]Turn it up a little bit.
[09:22.19]Okay, now we gotta go save Chrono.
[09:25.96]Hmm.
[09:26.52]That's...
[09:58.26]The Black Omen.
[10:06.84]The Death's Ferry hasn't come for us?
[10:14.26]Isla no like boat, boat no like Isla.
[10:18.21]The Ocean Palace, but no.
[10:22.65]Look, look, something strange.
[10:36.27]So... the cool thing about, um... The Black Omen... is... there it is.
[10:40.76]Go watch this.
[10:42.66]But because this is where we are right now... let's just go to the present.
[11:10.08]It's just here.
[11:14.20]And... It's really creepy because... It's just been here for... Ever.
[11:26.51]So when you talk to townspeople now... For instance... Let's go into Croto's house.
[11:39.31]Oh hello, is Crono alright?
[11:40.51]Oh boy.
[11:45.12]People talk about it, like, oh, the Black Omen is so beautiful today!
[11:48.30]It's weird.
[11:50.42]It's creepy.
[11:50.86]I forget who says it specifically, but when I first saw it, when I was younger, I was like, wait, no, it's not...
[12:07.54]It's just, when something is around for ten plus twenty plus thousand, a hundred thousand, a million years, it is just normal, isn't it?
[12:22.88]It's just like the moon at that point, yeah.
[12:24.62]Just this horrifying, horrible thing that you just know is a normal thing.
[12:27.84]It's weird.
[12:35.22]And Chrono Trigger did this cool thing.
[12:36.62]This is... I don't wanna say this is unheard of at the time, but... Let's go talk to Melchior.
[12:44.32]What does it portend?
[13:04.42]Gonna build my house under the Black Omen.
[13:06.65]Yeah.
[13:14.49]So, uh, let's go in it.
[13:27.46]We could talk... Actually, we could go talk to the... Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:31.63]I got something I want to do.
[13:32.45]I want to go get, um...
[13:35.09]I want to go fight... What's his name there?
[13:55.94]We need to talk to you.
[13:57.10]Hey, that spiky-haired fellow hasn't been coming around lately!
[14:03.21]Might as well try to get the magic tabs.
[14:38.09]What is Ice 2?
[14:46.55]Ah, I love that one.
[14:47.27]It's so crunchy sounding.
[15:00.54]You doing it too?
[15:01.24]Okay.
[15:03.34]Uh, I want Fire 2.
[15:11.55]That could be better.
[15:18.88]That's going to be like 600 or 700.
[15:19.88]Just keep Magus alive.
[15:30.40]I can do it.
[15:50.68]Again.
[15:51.44]Uh, I'm just gonna use Lapis.
[16:02.82]Where's Chrono?
[16:03.56]Uh, he's sleeping.
[16:11.67]Uh oh.
[16:16.15]Alright, thank god it was just single target.
[16:19.22]Let's do lightning too.
[16:39.30]It's gotta be getting close.
[16:44.78]I hope my favorite time-traveling mute protagonist is doing okay.
[16:49.38]Yeah!
[16:57.69]Doing alright.
[17:13.50]There's some people in chat actually concerned.
[17:15.38]It's funny.
[17:16.78]Wait, no.
[17:17.30]Is he actually okay, guys?
[17:19.27]Is he?
[17:21.91]Just watch the rest of the movie.
[17:29.85]You grab somebody by the shirt during the movie, like... Some character just died, and you just grab your friend by the shirt.
[17:36.28]No, no, honestly, man.
[17:38.06]Come here, is he alright?
[17:38.88]It's like, I don't... Man, we watched the same movie!
[17:43.74]Oh, but do you know if he's okay?
[17:47.04]That was embarrassing.
[17:50.01]Do something!
[17:50.81]You have to do something, man!
[17:52.21]Yeah.
[17:58.76]Specchio's Healthy Choice Set.
[18:02.83]Damn.
[18:04.21]That's like $20,000.
[18:06.55]That's actually like $10,000 to $20,000 worth of stuff.
[18:08.73]Okay.
[18:20.12]Let's get some info here.
[18:21.52]Do we know who this is now?
[18:27.90]Oh, where's that sprightly young man?
[18:29.58]Oh, I see.
[18:34.09]How terrible.
[18:37.71]There's little I can do for you, but let me honor him with a song.
[18:43.36]I call it Memories of Crono.
[18:55.10]Were there anything more I could do, I would, but I fear I can be of little aid.
[19:02.52]Only the Guru of Time can help us now.
[19:05.98]That face... have I... not seen you before?
[19:12.93]Ah, indeed, you've grown strong.
[19:15.07]Tainted of soul, to be sure, but formidable all the same.
[19:19.67]Hm?
[19:21.56]The Guru of Time, you say?
[19:23.24]I know of him.
[19:25.06]What business have you with the Guru of Time?
[19:26.92]We've heard he may know a way to restore life to our fallen friend.
[19:32.12]The truth of it I do not know.
[19:33.53]Ah, yes.
[19:37.13]To break death's hold over one you hold dear still.
[19:41.41]You are not the first to wish such a thing, nor will you be the last.
[19:45.89]Crono must be happy indeed knowing such dear friends as you.
[19:54.99]Alright, we gotta go to Balthazar.
[19:57.11]Hey!
[19:59.73]Hey!
[20:03.91]Here.
[20:05.55]Take this with you.
[20:10.49]Egg?
[20:11.33]Ida eat egg?
[20:12.39]Okay eat?
[20:14.99]That is the Chrono Trigger.
[20:17.21]A time egg.
[20:18.89]Should you wish to try and hatch it, the one who crafted your wings of time can tell you the way.
[20:27.41]But know that it may not necessarily hatch the results which you desire.
[20:33.23]The Chrono Trigger represents potential.
[20:36.17]Results require action.
[20:39.21]As long as you keep chrono in your heart and pursue what you seek, the results should follow.
[20:45.60]But I can make no guarantees.
[20:48.88]I see it now.
[20:50.00]It's you, isn't it?
[20:52.85]Then... then you are Gaspar, the guru of time.
[20:57.26]That's the wrong voice!
[21:03.74]Yes, I believe that is what they used to call me, but that was a long, long, long time ago.
[21:08.80]That is the Chrono Trigger.
[21:15.94]A time egg.
[21:16.60]Should you wish to try and hatch it, the one who crafted your wings of time can tell you the way.
[21:23.13]Alright, so we gotta go back to... The future, right?
[21:35.00]Put it in your PC.
[21:36.24]Yeah, put it in the... Put it in my computer.
[21:44.07]Away, epoch!
[21:56.52]There's that piece of shit.
[21:57.66]Alright, I forget where he is.
[22:05.18]Keeper's dome?
[22:05.82]Hey, the game is named after an egg.
[22:25.85]Yeah.
[22:28.06]Another magic capsule.
[22:36.60]Ah!
[22:38.39]Death Peak harbors a power capable of restoring the slain to life.
[22:43.83]But the power to reverse death is not one easily invoked.
[22:47.43]The need must be great in the person's existence of the utmost importance.
[22:51.96]And what's more, you'll need a double, a doll identical to that person in every detail.
[22:57.40]Then and only then will the power deign to hatch the egg.
[23:02.50]Without the doppel doll, there is no meaning in going to Death Peak.
[23:06.08]Go to the place you have left it and retrieve it with all haste.
[23:12.27]We got this in the first session of me playing the game.
[23:21.21]Do you remember what it is?
[23:29.82]It's in my house.
[23:33.38]Or Chrono's house to be more specific.
[23:35.74]Cats.
[24:07.30]Oh no, she doesn't know.
[24:08.08]Uh-oh.
[24:11.96]Yeah?
[24:34.32]We've need of this doll.
[24:36.47]But only for a time.
[24:39.69]Oh, go right ahead, dear.
[24:42.21]Boy.
[24:51.44]Doppel doll.
[25:00.66]You stay out of trouble now.
[25:05.49]Aye.
[25:07.35]Can we borrow this life-sized statue of your son that you keep in his room?
[25:11.22]Well, to be fair, we kept it in our room.
[25:17.26]She doesn't keep that.
[25:18.24]I mean, we got that as a prize.
[25:20.24]Alright, now we gotta go to Death Peak.
[25:27.70]Now here's the fun part about Chrono Trigger.
[25:30.72]We don't have to do this.
[25:33.00]We actually just don't have to do this.
[25:45.99]Uh, you can just leave Chrono- Chrono can just be dead.
[25:49.23]You don't have to even do any of this.
[25:54.95]Oh, this is a sun shrine!
[26:00.03]Wait, don't do this yet, I think this is a boss.
[26:04.09]No, you leave- okay, you can get- you can put something in there, and you leave it there for like a million years.
[26:09.99]I have to save the game, holy shit, you're right.
[26:22.71]Do I have it?
[26:24.05]I might even have the item.
[26:25.91]No, I don't.
[26:28.09]This one is hard too.
[26:29.55]Yeah, I can't promise I'm going to do all, every side mission.
[26:34.11]Because, I mean, I could try, but a lot of them are very specific.
[26:39.20]I know a couple that I really want to do.
[26:43.26]I think I actually do have to, do I have to go back and talk to Balthazar?
[26:49.90]Let's do it anyways.
[26:56.93]The rainbow shell is definitely the coolest item in the game, so I kind of have to get it.
[27:00.50]If we can help you though, then not too crazy.
[27:09.28]That's true.
[27:10.06]Shouldn't be too bad.
[27:10.66]Uh, where is the keeper's dome?
[27:15.79]I just went by it, I think.
[27:25.50]Yeah, we're going all day and all night if I have to.
[27:29.38]We're finishing this tonight because I think I'm going to get to a point where there's going to be like two hours left of the game total.
[27:37.21]And I could finish it.
[27:40.09]But let's just do it.
[27:42.37]I'm good for it.
[27:44.94]I said I wanted to play it.
[27:47.76]Alright, death peak.
[27:50.28]Okay, now we're good.
[27:51.61]Executing program.
[28:25.78]alright because the wind is really strong and it just blows you down if you don't hide behind these spoilers
[28:47.31]The three entities you just saw will aid you on Death Peak.
[28:50.57]This ends my message.
[28:51.99]Now I must ask you a favor.
[28:54.02]This construct has reached the end of its final program.
[28:57.82]Please, let him rest.
[29:00.48]The switch is on his stomach.
[29:06.14]See you later, Balthazar.
[29:11.22]Have a good rest.
[29:16.69]You did good.
[29:17.19]You helped save the whole world.
[29:18.57]You deserve at least six hours.
[29:24.93]At least.
[29:26.79]Okay.
[29:50.96]Death Peak.
[29:59.67]Walk when the wind dies down and hide behind trees when it picks up strength.
[30:02.93]Okay.
[30:13.65]Oh shit!
[30:17.95]Sorry.
[30:31.98]Oh, shit.
[30:37.69]It's slippery.
[30:43.65]Alright, I made it.
[30:46.52]I think it stops doing that now.
[30:55.04]What does Magus have?
[30:55.80]A scythe, right?
[31:06.53]Big hit.
[31:11.87]I gotta get some new equipment.
[31:24.14]We want the tech points because they will learn stuff together.
[31:29.54]Magic ring.
[31:30.36]What does a magic ring do?
[31:33.76]I love his art.
[31:35.24]He's got a great art.
[31:37.40]Shiloh's amulet prevents all status ailments.
[31:41.65]Plus six magic.
[31:42.71]Holy shit.
[31:45.83]Maybe he should have this.
[31:46.71]50% HP.
[31:51.23]That's a huge amount of HP to lose, though.
[31:59.97]He's got the same hairline as you?
[32:01.31]I don't know if I can take this off.
[32:14.74]I'm going to give it to Magus.
[32:19.04]That's a monster increase.
[32:20.36]He'll do so much more damage.
[32:21.24]How do I get to the left?
[32:35.95]I want that.
[32:39.43]The golden stud is insane on Magus.
[32:46.89]Yeah, that is crazy too.
[32:49.87]That's almost best in slot.
[32:51.49]I don't think you can ever take this off.
[32:59.82]Uh, magic capsules.
[33:00.98]I was going to give them to frog because I want frog needs the healing.
[33:08.03]Magus has 50.
[33:10.70]I think I have to dump it into Frog.
[33:12.82]I know that that's bad because Frog's magic is bad.
[33:16.04]That's exactly why I want to do it.
[33:21.30]We need Frog to have better heals.
[33:22.45]So I'm just going to do it.
[33:33.91]It might not be meta, but it's what we're doing.
[33:54.49]You just put four pills down his throat.
[33:56.19]I hate these!
[34:04.91]Isla leveled up, good.
[34:18.48]Skeleton.
[34:21.75]Let's try, let's just do a water.
[34:29.33]That should kill everybody.
[34:31.19]Yeah.
[34:32.75]No!
[34:33.33]Damn.
[34:33.79]Okay.
[34:39.86]He's just gonna show Frog up so bad right here.
[34:41.80]Yeah.
[34:43.84]We're doing it for the heals.
[34:53.09]No new tech?
[34:55.23]What?
[35:03.87]Did you remember me and my wife are staying up late?
[35:05.28]How long are you going to be streaming for?
[35:06.74]A very long time.
[35:19.80]We are going until this is finished.
[35:23.87]So I'm not putting a time.
[35:24.87]There's no time limit on this.
[35:27.75]Just is what it is.
[35:28.69]Thousand gold there.
[35:38.38]Oh my god!
[35:39.04]It's like a, it's Lavos, it's a mini Lavos.
[35:47.78]Oh shit, that's bad.
[35:48.69]Uh oh.
[35:52.69]Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[36:01.21]Uh, uh oh.
[36:02.35]This is actually really bad.
[36:07.25]She has zero HP, but she's still alive.
[36:12.82]Oh, she's dead.
[36:13.56]Ah, hold on.
[36:26.48]Hold on.
[36:29.80]We need Isla right now.
[36:33.26]Okay.
[36:34.41]This should be alright.
[36:43.72]Sleep?
[36:44.06]It's okay.
[36:48.66]Alright, we're doing fine.
[36:52.19]I think I'm just gonna go for regular attacks.
[36:53.43]Let's see, what does it do?
[36:56.05]18?
[36:58.41]Hit it in the face.
[36:59.01]Oh shit, this is gonna be bad.
[37:07.58]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[37:15.35]Yuck.
[37:20.64]What is wrong with this chat?
[37:21.92]What, are people being weird?
[37:22.70]Stop being weird if you're being weird.
[37:25.94]Okay.
[37:44.24]I gotta get something going here.
[37:45.20]I'm gonna do an Isla tech.
[37:48.82]Something just devastating.
[37:55.11]Cat attack, maybe?
[37:55.85]I'm gonna do cat attack.
[37:59.07]There we go.
[38:03.23]Good.
[38:14.86]I think I'm in a good spot.
[38:22.67]Same thing.
[38:26.13]Yeah, just don't attack the body or you're gonna get owned.
[38:39.57]Yeah.
[38:45.21]Stop everybody off.
[38:48.65]That looked perfectly normal.
[38:50.03]I yeah, I don't know.
[38:54.11]I just looked over and saw somebody say was like, hey man, why is what's this chat is fucked up right now?
[39:08.36]There we go.
[39:10.62]Nice.
[39:13.16]Um, OK.
[39:15.47]I think we're going to learn a new tech.
[39:22.19]Not yet, damn.
[39:26.16]Gigaton arm.
[39:33.94]Yeah, that's a gigaton arm.
[39:36.82]That's almost 50 damage higher.
[39:43.69]Damn.
[39:52.30]Too bad we're not using him.
[40:05.63]Get the chat on, bro.
[40:17.27]Magus is so good.
[40:32.28]A brave sword?
[40:33.20]That's got to be frog, right?
[40:36.82]It's just better?
[40:43.88]Yeah.
[40:50.21]Who knew that ice was going to work so well on Ice Mountain?
[40:54.41]True.
[41:10.49]Alright, so we're back here.
[41:16.55]Give me that.
[41:18.73]Oh shit, nice.
[41:25.48]I need a save point.
[41:29.46]I want that.
[41:42.43]I love the way that frog jumps.
[41:47.47]It is cool.
[41:51.89]A good portion of regular live viewers leave for Chrono Trigger?
[41:55.49]That's fine.
[41:55.91]That's alright.
[41:56.27]I mean, there's still a lot of people here.
[42:05.45]There's still more people here than I thought would be here.
[42:10.67]So, it's all good, don't worry.
[42:12.27]Don't worry about that.
[42:25.11]I mean, streams are all over the place these days that... Yesterday it's doing scary games and it's crazy and then today we're doing sponsor stuff and... Random games and Chrono Trigger and...
[42:40.70]It's all good.
[42:41.12]If you're here, you're here.
[42:42.08]If you're not, then maybe we'll see you again another time.
[42:47.89]It's all good.
[42:54.13]Just do what you enjoy.
[43:04.42]Oh, yeah.
[43:06.10]No, trust me.
[43:06.76]That's exactly what we're doing right now.
[43:13.86]I really kind of do want to give Haste a little bit more real time.
[43:17.25]Even if it's off stream.
[43:18.03]Because I feel like I got to the point where I was just barely starting to understand how it was supposed to be played.
[43:24.99]And then Ster came in and Ster got in my head.
[43:28.31]And I jumped off a cliff.
[43:30.29]But I actually think I would really like that game a lot.
[43:35.50]You should do what you hate.
[43:36.64]Barrier?
[43:41.48]What's that?
[43:46.04]Holy shit.
[43:47.20]Uh, I think I'm gonna... I want that on Isla.
[43:52.75]Yeah.
[43:55.01]I want Isla to be unkillable.
[44:12.76]Probably not gonna see this, but watching you makes me happier.
[44:14.82]Thanks.
[44:17.45]Alright, if this is the spot that you like to just chill and hang out and watch stuff, that is... that's cool.
[44:29.89]Sickle.
[44:35.58]That's a lot better.
[44:46.08]I'll have one of those, but with, uh, wait, I gotta be ready for this.
[44:49.51]Am I ready for this?
[44:50.13]Yeah.
[45:02.88]I want to do aerial strike, yeah.
[45:06.78]Direct targeting stuff is important.
[45:16.96]New scythe, good.
[45:26.26]Can I, will boulder, boulder toss even work?
[45:45.61]Mmm, just do damage, whatever.
[45:49.59]Let me try it.
[45:56.79]Is it true that the majority of Jermamites are like 30?
[46:02.96]I really don't even know anymore, honestly.
[46:12.73]I have some analytics on Twitch.
[46:16.50]But I think this channel has seen such massively shifting demographics over the last 10 to 15 years.
[46:24.12]It's really kind of hard to tell.
[46:25.14]Nice.
[46:42.74]Every time this gets brought up, like once every month or two, once every few months.
[46:47.27]Ooh, dark bomb.
[46:49.63]It looks like the consensus is somewhere around 20 to 30, like 20.
[46:52.45]I see a lot of like 22 to 26.
[46:53.61]I'm doing this for a reason.
[46:54.51]Don't worry.
[47:15.17]Frog's at 999 health.
[47:16.37]Can he even go higher than 999?
[47:24.53]Oh, shit.
[47:32.44]You could burn a pole?
[47:33.20]Eh.
[47:44.28]Alright, we're gonna be careful again.
[47:45.46]The footing here is icy and slick.
[47:48.32]Be careful.
[47:48.90]Fall and you'll have to start over.
[47:52.53]Alright, so I'm gonna... walk this instead of run it.
[47:56.73]Let's go.
[48:11.62]Yaksha Blade.
[48:26.57]Yeah, anytime I look at my analytics, it's kind of what you guys are saying.
[48:30.47]It's in that ballpark.
[48:51.41]Are you happy that you're still hip with the kids?
[48:56.52]I'm just gonna... I'm just doing my thing over here.
[48:59.48]I don't think too much about any of that.
[49:12.65]Stop blowing snot bubbles?
[49:16.71]Push the shell.
[49:17.55]Climb the shell.
[49:22.25]I know what that means.
[49:40.40]You're hip with the animals, too.
[49:41.80]My cat loves watching you.
[49:50.16]You know what?
[49:50.52]Fuck it.
[49:50.80]We're doing Dark Bomb.
[50:07.21]Damn.
[50:19.26]I'm actually fine taking the hit.
[50:21.09]Do it again.
[50:34.25]Oh shit, I forgot.
[50:35.35]Uh, it's okay.
[50:37.78]I think he should be dead in a second.
[50:42.00]Uh... Uh oh.
[50:54.06]Don't sleep.
[50:55.90]Yes!
[50:56.36]We're fine.
[51:02.57]Thank goodness.
[51:05.15]No!
[51:05.45]Uh, hopefully this kills it.
[51:15.52]Die.
[51:17.00]That's bad.
[51:19.77]I might lose right here.
[51:20.53]Oh, that's...
[51:30.76]That's it.
[51:33.62]Is that it?
[51:34.00]That's not it.
[51:42.77]I need to stay alive.
[51:50.25]I need to stay alive again.
[51:51.21]Okay, now we revive.
[52:00.45]Magus.
[52:03.99]Now we heal Magus.
[52:07.03]Shit, don't fall asleep.
[52:10.72]Oh, fuck you!
[52:11.60]Alright, just Dark Bomb again and just end it.
[52:20.06]This has to be it.
[52:23.35]Yep, alright.
[52:24.27]Good.
[52:33.33]Now you can push the shell.
[52:34.39]Is there anything up here?
[52:46.16]There is something up here.
[52:48.64]Dark Helm?
[53:05.49]I am coming up on a break.
[53:08.33]I will be taking in about a minute.
[53:10.93]And when I come back, we'll go right back to it.
[53:25.71]There we go.
[53:29.33]What do I do during breaks?
[53:30.41]I will get a water.
[53:31.33]I'll stretch my legs a little bit.
[53:32.47]I'll kind of walk around.
[53:36.16]Check on how Holly's doing, how Otto's doing.
[53:39.08]Just, you know, just kind of checking.
[53:47.90]Have shadow damage.
[53:49.55]I want that on you.
[53:54.51]Ooh.
[53:56.47]Wait, can Magus... Magus the only one that can wear that?
[54:04.49]Magus kind of needs it, yeah.
[54:08.82]Alright, I will be right back.
[54:10.83]See you guys in a few minutes.
[55:04.60]Thank you.
[58:55.21]Thank you.
[60:05.00]Thank you.
[60:56.99]Where were we?
[61:05.11]Let me move my mic.
[61:07.47]Okay.
[61:08.53]It's getting scary.
[61:17.03]We're getting pretty high up.
[61:24.17]This is it.
[61:25.27]The summit of Death Peak.
[61:33.14]You who fear the night and stand against the darkness lend us your strength.
[61:39.26]Crow now.
[61:42.38]The pendant's reacting.
[61:54.49]I love how they're using the flex animation.
[62:02.32]It's shattered!
[62:02.92]It was folly to come here.
[62:07.10]All this for naught.
[62:11.04]No cry.
[62:11.94]I la miss Crono too.
[62:13.30]Sad Crono no comeback.
[62:22.31]Crono answer us!
[62:25.54]Uh-oh.
[62:43.45]Like stone statues, an unsettling sight.
[62:47.92]A time freeze.
[62:49.38]I never dreamt it possible.
[62:52.58]Just Isla move?
[63:04.66]We just need to exchange the doppel doll for Crono.
[63:07.00]Boys and girls, we got him.
[63:48.04]Merry Christmas, yeah.
[63:57.97]Good of you to return, Chrono.
[64:00.51]Chrono back.
[64:01.35]Chrono okay?
[64:08.28]He's good.
[64:09.06]He lives.
[64:09.88]He lives.
[64:15.50]You should be thankful.
[64:17.78]You are blessed to be so loved by everyone, you lucky, lucky fool.
[64:40.43]He's back.
[64:45.33]So, all went well.
[64:47.68]Now, don't thank me.
[64:48.66]I merely placed a piece upon the board.
[64:51.35]It was not my hand that moved it.
[64:54.17]If you would thank someone, thank the ones who cared enough to see their friend return to them.
[64:58.71]By the way, the Wings of Time have come looking for you.
[65:02.92]They seem to have a hardened mind all their own.
[65:06.26]You wish to fight Lavos, correct?
[65:08.76]Many paths lie before you.
[65:10.98]You might choose to leap into that bucket, or fly the Wings of Time to the day of Lavos.
[65:16.18]Well, there's the Black Omen, which now straddles time, seeking to summon Lavos yet again.
[65:22.28]Such folly, lusting so greedily after power that the power wields you.
[65:27.51]It is up to you to decide when and where you will face Lavos.
[65:30.99]However, do not think that you stand alone.
[65:34.39]I've had glimpses, albeit vague, of events, people, places that will empower you.
[65:39.95]A forest brought back to life by the sheer determination of a woman in the Middle Ages.
[65:45.39]The fortress of one of Magus' three former generals in the Middle Ages.
[65:50.39]A task to be done in the future in a birthplace of machines.
[65:54.99]A prehistoric stone that will shine with the light of all the ages of the world.
[66:00.68]The restless spirit of a proud knight, slain by Magus in the Middle Ages, lingering even in the present.
[66:08.49]Okay.
[66:40.09]So, uh, we have reached the end of the video game.
[66:45.59]Everything that he just said is optional.
[66:49.35]You can do all of them, or you can do none of them.
[66:55.83]We could do whatever we want.
[67:00.09]I def- okay, all of those things that he said... are for everybody's... let's call it, like, best in-slot piece of gear.
[67:11.05]So if you don't necessarily care about, oh, Luca's best thing in the whole game, you don't really have to do that.
[67:20.54]But it's recommended that you do whatever party you think you're going to have in the very end of the game, which we are.
[67:27.16]At least do, if this is what I kind of want to run with, at least do Magus, Isla, and Frog's quest.
[67:37.10]They're all good.
[67:37.70]They're all really good, yeah.
[67:43.79]Do it all.
[67:44.27]If you don't, it's like skipping Peach's frying pan.
[67:46.69]Yeah.
[67:48.23]Isla doesn't have a quest.
[67:52.92]That's not the Sunstone?
[67:53.94]No, the Sunstone is not Isla.
[67:59.38]Now we're going to get our last thing.
[68:00.42]See, the Time Egg now turns into the Fated Hour.
[68:04.92]The Sunstone is nobody.
[68:05.94]I at least want to give Chrono that weapon I just got.
[68:21.04]Sunstone best gun for Luka?
[68:22.48]Ah.
[68:24.02]Alright.
[68:31.38]I really need to decide what the actual final party is going to look like.
[68:35.72]I actually don't know.
[68:43.42]I mean, I kind of like this setup.
[68:49.84]Robo could replace Magus.
[68:53.47]And we could roll with this.
[69:04.00]Everybody's going to have an opinion on this.
[69:06.66]There's going to be a million opinions.
[69:11.61]There's a lot of ways to swing this.
[69:17.82]But I'm not even sure I want Chrono in the party.
[69:19.50]Well, who do you replace him with?
[69:30.78]We could do this.
[69:31.70]We could do default party.
[69:34.09]We ran with this for most of the game.
[69:37.95]Could do this.
[69:43.41]Replace Isla?
[69:45.79]I don't think I want to.
[69:49.14]I've never taken Isla through the game.
[69:50.49]Isla got stale, I said it.
[69:54.85]Oh no.
[70:03.63]I'll stick with this for now.
[70:05.17]I like this group.
[70:07.49]Eels could be better.
[70:08.31]I think it might actually have to... it might be this though.
[70:17.93]I love Robo.
[70:18.79]These are my two favorite characters.
[70:32.13]He's Shadow technically, so if I have Robo, then they're both Shadow.
[70:37.41]This would be Water, Shadow, Physical.
[70:39.21]Alright, I'm going to give you a couple of options and you guys can choose.
[70:49.33]Let's get a poll going.
[70:51.09]We're doing Frog Robo Isla, Frog Magus Isla, or Chrono Magus Isla.
[71:09.78]Isla is going to stay in no matter what.
[71:18.80]I'm very curious about this.
[71:20.66]You grow up, you bench in the main character.
[71:22.40]Why don't you grow up?
[71:29.34]Oh.
[71:31.85]I would vote on this.
[71:32.69]If you're in a different tab right now, you could do this.
[71:37.87]This is GG.
[71:38.77]Yeah, that's over.
[71:51.40]Yeah, Chatter, you could alter the course of time right now.
[72:03.15]Seems pretty sealed.
[72:04.49]What is that?
[72:12.35]What is that sticker?
[72:14.82]Alright.
[72:23.51]This is the party.
[72:24.11]This is what we're going with.
[72:30.32]Chrono benched.
[72:31.68]Robo benched.
[72:34.80]I'm sorry, Robo.
[72:36.76]Since I was 12 years old, you were in every party I ever had.
[72:41.08]Not this time.
[72:43.09]Cool.
[72:59.27]Father, I wonder how you're doing now.
[73:02.85]Take me with you?
[73:03.47]Oh.
[73:06.17]Stream sucks.
[73:10.03]Hey, if 50% of you voted for this.
[73:14.47]Solar energy was used eons ago, long before Lavos was discovered as a source of power.
[73:19.82]It might be just the thing we need to combat him.
[73:24.06]Dead on.
[73:28.65]Alright, we need to go to Magus's castle in the Middle Ages.
[73:34.15]That's where we get Magus's true shit.
[73:37.89]Let's do it.
[73:39.44]Hold on.
[73:39.82]Oh, you're still back.
[73:58.47]Away, Epoch!
[74:03.31]My candidate didn't get nominated.
[74:06.69]It's alright.
[74:16.08]Let's go.
[74:18.48]Ozzie's Fort.
[74:24.84]Welcome and well met.
[74:25.90]This is the great Ozzies.
[74:28.62]What?
[74:34.23]Lord Magus, I... It is good to see you again, Ozzy.
[74:40.21]The nerve!
[74:41.41]You think you can talk to me after you desert your fellow fiends to lick the boots of these filthy humans?
[74:46.90]You're not our lord, you're a traitor.
[74:49.76]Why did you leave us?
[74:52.90]Oh boy...
[75:02.63]You pesky low-down good-for-nothings can't take a hint, eh?
[75:06.53]Guess I know what I have to do now.
[75:07.93]Flee!
[75:12.47]I saved before this, right?
[75:15.24]You called?
[75:17.06]Oh dear me, if it isn't Lord Magus!
[75:19.32]You must like shame to have come back here.
[75:21.36]A human-loving traitor like you deserves to be punished like the bad, bad boy you are.
[75:28.13]Stand back, Great Ozzy, and let me take care of these cretins.
[75:32.36]Alright, I'll just leave it to you then, Flea.
[75:37.54]Alright, time for a good hard spanking.
[75:39.98]Alright, let's do some tech.
[76:01.47]So that's going in the memory bank.
[76:07.45]Yeah.
[76:13.50]Okay.
[76:21.40]Uh, get annihilated?
[76:24.05]Oh, just you wait.
[76:24.77]I'll teach you a lesson next time.
[76:36.75]What's this?
[76:39.69]What a dope.
[77:12.29]Ozzy's in a pickle.
[77:16.75]I'm outta here.
[77:17.27]Isn't there something down here?
[77:27.16]I guess not.
[77:34.78]Don't you people ever give up?
[77:36.78]Well, looks like there's only one choice.
[77:39.10]Slash!
[77:44.10]This guy actually hurts a lot.
[77:45.10]He's summoned.
[77:48.02]Take care of this for me, will you?
[77:49.06]Slash.
[77:51.99]This party does not have a triple tech.
[77:55.67]They don't?
[77:57.19]Aw, shit.
[77:58.47]It's alright.
[78:00.95]Normally I would not deign to cross blades with my former lord but who am I to question the complex workings of fate?
[78:08.32]Ready yourself.
[78:16.28]Somebody was saying to do it.
[78:27.20]Magus doesn't get dual techs.
[78:32.53]Is Magus a part of any... Oh shit, I forgot.
[78:35.75]Does Magus have any triple techs at all?
[78:48.50]He has one.
[78:49.24]Robo and Luka.
[79:00.76]You need gemstones for it, though.
[79:07.54]You win this time.
[79:10.92]Magus does so much damage alone as most double techs, yeah.
[79:16.88]That is very true.
[79:20.10]Come on, sweethearts.
[79:21.10]Elizabeth goes, here, gotcha.
[79:33.92]I don't care, we're fine.
[79:40.71]Ooh, that hurt.
[79:46.67]Watch this.
[80:08.94]That's cheating.
[80:09.64]That's gaming.
[80:11.90]Okay, there's a secret in this room.
[80:21.78]Where is it?
[80:22.66]There it is.
[80:26.77]Doomscythe, Gloomhelm, and Gloomcape.
[80:31.71]Imagine missing that.
[80:37.50]Prevents all status ailments.
[80:40.79]Massive defense.
[80:41.73]And there's a magic capsule too.
[80:50.69]Alright, here we go.
[81:04.95]Not so fast, friends.
[81:05.92]This time's not gonna be so easy.
[81:08.52]Aussie pants.
[81:10.62]Flea bustier.
[81:13.18]Slasher, too.
[81:16.14]With these items combined, we're invincible.
[81:18.18]Get ready to witness true power.
[81:19.76]Alright, who's priority here?
[81:23.19]I think we kill Flea first.
[81:32.41]Or Slash.
[81:53.33]Get it!
[82:02.15]Shit!
[82:02.51]Alright, we have to stay alive until she can do it to everybody.
[82:23.45]And we'll do a Lapis too.
[82:25.15]Oh, I got it!
[82:25.49]What did I get?
[82:25.81]What did I get?
[82:27.13]I didn't even see it.
[82:27.69]What did I get?
[82:28.11]I didn't even see it.
[82:32.41]Glee Buster?
[82:42.50]I'm not sure I've ever even done that before.
[82:52.38]What'd I get?
[83:01.19]Slash or two?
[83:01.95]Hell yeah.
[83:05.01]And then Aussie pants.
[83:09.99]Whoa!
[83:18.76]That hurts my head.
[83:31.53]Oh my god!
[83:32.45]Give me a chance to play!
[83:36.75]I might have to revive him.
[83:37.55]He might die.
[83:46.92]Don't do it, frog.
[83:47.52]Okay.
[83:55.81]Oh my god, they're so fast.
[83:56.61]Okay.
[83:56.81]Shit.
[83:56.91]That's bad.
[83:57.15]Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[84:24.08]And then we need to revive frog.
[84:28.02]Don't look away.
[84:28.64]Look away.
[84:30.48]And then we revive frog and then we do high potion on frog.
[84:38.65]We're okay.
[84:42.63]Then I'll do heal with frog and we'll steal from Ozzy.
[84:51.39]Dark bomb on fleet.
[84:54.61]Got it.
[84:54.85]Alright, I got all the items.
[84:57.35]Don't lose.
[84:58.01]I need to win now.
[85:02.19]Oh man.
[85:10.26]I'm glad we're turning the triple tech off.
[85:15.04]Shit.
[85:29.51]That's not terrible.
[85:32.51]Hmm.
[85:35.14]Oh!
[85:36.04]Hell yeah.
[85:58.42]Alright, well that turned off the triple thing.
[86:11.55]Alright, now this should go much easier.
[86:32.00]Go Super Frog!
[86:33.46]I like that one.
[86:46.01]Super Frog!
[86:51.35]It's got candy.
[86:54.17]That's an old one.
[86:55.79]Isn't it weird that that's considered old?
[87:00.76]That video and that whole thing?
[87:05.28]Somebody asked me earlier, like, oh, how do you feel about, like, people watching you?
[87:09.40]That's, that's, that's cool.
[87:11.19]That's fine.
[87:12.33]What's weird to me now is some of that stuff that was, oh, Super Frog.
[87:16.25]Oh, how do you like it's got candy?
[87:18.93]It's almost a decade old.
[87:20.95]That doesn't feel right somehow.
[87:31.92]It kind of feels like it happened... two years ago.
[87:35.70]But also, it does not.
[87:38.26]It does feel like it was a very long time ago.
[87:44.44]There it is.
[87:48.23]Alright, this is big.
[87:48.87]We'll get some... level up, level up.
[87:53.29]Barrier!
[87:58.47]Impossible!
[88:02.09]Alright, I got some shit here.
[88:03.21]What'd I get?
[88:05.01]Aussie pants.
[88:06.06]Defense 45 and then with a bunch of question marks?
[88:13.72]You wear them on your head?
[88:27.37]Flea bustier.
[88:29.73]Plus 12 magic defense.
[88:36.56]I want her to be crazy.
[88:44.50]Slasher 2 is a sword, I think.
[88:51.82]They're his underpants.
[88:53.34]Ew.
[88:54.63]Well, they're not.
[88:58.71]Ew.
[89:08.35]Okay, well Isla has them both on.
[89:09.83]She's going to be pretty cracked out.
[89:17.40]Speed Ring and Clarity Cap.
[89:22.18]No more Confuse.
[89:26.84]Max Speed.
[89:34.07]I don't know.
[89:41.78]I'm happy with this for now.
[89:47.48]You can't defeat me!
[89:48.18]What would become of fiendkind?
[89:49.00]I can't lose!
[89:49.32]I won't!
[90:14.76]Wait, why'd she just do that?
[90:19.47]Is it the Aussie pants?
[90:26.97]Oh shit.
[90:29.21]It's auto-confuse?
[90:36.17]Really?
[90:39.21]So are they just the highest defense thing in the game, but you can't control the character?
[90:55.22]I love the cat noise in this game.
[91:02.57]No, not that one!
[91:09.59]See ya.
[91:13.26]What'd he want?
[91:13.88]I do not understand.
[91:24.56]That was just a slowed down meow?
[91:28.81]It actually might have been.
[91:39.43]Well, that's it.
[91:41.52]We've completed Aussie Fortress.
[91:46.04]But... We can now do something else.
[91:56.63]Whoa.
[91:58.09]Weird looking.
[92:02.45]We go to Medina Village.
[92:06.72]Wait, where is Medina?
[92:07.56]Down here?
[92:07.94]Oh, it's in the present.
[92:23.28]Oh, don't people get scared, don't they?
[92:24.78]Peace at last.
[92:27.92]Thanks for the hero.
[92:28.76]Hurrah, the great hero.
[92:30.06]Hurrah for Guardia.
[92:30.92]If you walk around as Magus, don't people go, what the hell are you doing?
[92:34.74]Okay, ready?
[92:49.39]Go to the present.
[92:59.57]So what happened?
[93:00.09]Oh, long time no see!
[93:05.01]How you been?
[93:05.48]They're gonna start running a ferry between Truce and Medina soon.
[93:10.98]So this is the descendant.
[93:21.55]Yes, sir!
[93:22.03]I'm scrubbing as hard as I can!
[93:23.35]I'm not slacking off, I swear!
[93:24.67]Why's he gotta be so mean?
[93:30.48]You just doomed his descendants to a life of servitude.
[93:59.73]No, we repaired the timeline and everyone's happy and everyone gets along.
[94:11.51]It's so peaceful these days.
[94:15.25]Hello there, how can I help you?
[94:16.45]I need a shitload of these.
[94:37.79]I'm blowing a lot of money, but I need it.
[94:46.19]What kind of junk do I have?
[94:47.49]Hold on.
[94:48.15]I don't need this, right?
[94:56.42]Crimson blade, radiant... I don't need any of this stuff.
[95:04.46]I'll keep some of the things that put the actual statuses on them.
[95:15.18]21,000 for this thing, holy shit.
[95:22.37]I'm not gonna sell much, um, no, don't sell armor.
[95:25.71]Who knows when I ever want it again.
[95:26.93]Alright, I got 100k.
[95:39.92]Get a shitload of these.
[95:43.98]You know what?
[95:44.34]Just buy up the whole store.
[95:47.98]Because I will forget to do this and just make sure I have a ton of these.
[95:55.06]Spend all my money.
[95:55.66]I don't care.
[96:11.40]What do you guys have to say?
[96:19.58]So peaceful.
[96:21.00]See?
[96:21.54]Fiends and humans are living together.
[96:23.28]But Dina's brewers know what they're doing.
[96:28.88]Life is good.
[96:29.58]No, thank you.
[96:42.17]And what's in the square?
[96:45.41]Nothing.
[96:46.51]Just people having... hanging out at the park.
[96:49.99]Oh, the Black Omen, the Black Omen.
[96:51.57]Let us say a prayer to the Black Omen.
[96:54.94]Well, that's still a problem, but we haven't fixed that yet.
[96:58.74]Why do I always get stuck doing this?
[97:02.42]Such a lovely day today, isn't it?
[97:10.89]Cool.
[97:12.76]Alright, what's next?
[97:13.40]We gotta do frogs.
[97:36.12]Where is frogs?
[97:37.00]I guess we gotta talk to them at the end of time.
[97:38.54]I'll give a...
[97:51.25]I'm just doing this to talk.
[98:02.25]Okay, so in there...
[98:22.63]Okay.
[98:23.29]I don't remember where that is, but I'll find it.
[98:25.33]Middle Ages.
[98:28.89]Chrono!
[98:29.25]Chrono!
[98:30.71]Fight Lavo!
[98:31.37]Strong armor!
[98:32.31]Isla village have!
[98:33.15]Go see!
[98:35.01]Isla go!
[98:35.57]Boring here!
[98:41.15]Don't you dare put us through that again.
[98:42.53]Okay, so we'll go do frogs.
[99:02.29]I love how it plays their theme song.
[99:05.20]That's so funny.
[99:05.88]I always thought that was cool.
[99:34.40]Are you different now?
[99:35.52]Nope.
[99:39.66]Alright, I know where to go.
[99:41.44]Let's do it.
[99:45.13]He's way more of a dick about that in the old translation.
[99:52.91]Yeah, I almost... I haven't played this in a very long time, so... I don't know exactly what the differences are.
[100:02.48]I'm catching some of them, but not all of them.
[100:06.78]Although it hasn't been an incredibly long time.
[100:10.98]So I'm not catching as many as I might if I'd played it recently.
[100:19.67]There it is.
[100:23.79]Do you like any Final Fantasies?
[100:29.46]Briefly talked about it before.
[100:32.25]I like Final Fantasy.
[100:35.01]I like the new one doing was really fun.
[100:37.97]The music was incredible.
[100:39.73]I wasn't a big Final Fantasy 7 guy, not really.
[101:02.99]Ah, that's pretty helpful.
[101:11.76]Are there cool optional bosses in this game?
[101:15.40]We are doing them right now.
[101:17.60]So yes.
[101:18.00]That was a lot, damn.
[101:27.85]Okay, so should I take off the pants?
[101:33.00]It's a ton of defense, but I feel like it's not helping us too much.
[101:35.71]182 defense, so that's crazy.
[101:40.35]But if you can't do anything... Maybe we should just put in the speed ring.
[101:53.70]Just have her be crazy cracked out.
[102:15.56]I almost want to... Yeah, I'm going to take off the earring for now.
[102:21.46]That's way too much magic defense to not have.
[102:36.86]Oh, he's out of mana.
[103:00.73]No physical damage allowed, apparently.
[103:18.50]Well, that's one way to do it.
[103:20.26]Dark Bomb is so good.
[103:26.83]Good.
[103:27.65]Always good to level up.
[103:30.59]Turbo Ether.
[103:39.16]Oh, shit.
[103:40.08]Nobody's healed. ...
[103:59.48]Stop it!
[104:00.92]Stop!
[104:03.20]Stop!
[104:35.51]Oh my god!
[104:36.45]A regular default swing with 300 damage?
[104:40.07]That's how you know we're in the late game.
[104:52.71]I think that'll... no?
[105:00.79]Don't kill him.
[105:08.90]Okay.
[105:11.10]What level is everybody now?
[105:12.18]40?
[105:12.70]Herman's level 40.
[105:16.92]I think I'm about to run into a save point again, so... Yoink.
[105:31.10]Don't call me a cheater.
[105:37.50]Don't you need to repair this or something?
[105:49.21]Don't you have somebody come fix this?
[106:00.73]He's like a builder.
[106:01.59]Who's a builder?
[106:02.25]Go back and get a guy to fix it back in time?
[106:19.73]Back in antiquity?
[106:20.55]No, that's not even... I don't think it's even here in antiquity.
[106:33.55]Yeah, I think you actually hire somebody.
[106:41.24]Can you fix this, like, 12,000 years in the past, this cathedral?
[106:44.70]Here we go.
[106:53.63]I think it's this guy.
[106:55.73]How am I supposed to work without my tools?
[107:01.03]Otomo, would that you'd stay here a bit longer?
[107:07.43]Ah, well met, frog!
[107:08.27]I finally stumbled upon a hint as to the whereabouts of the rainbow shell.
[107:12.13]Still, I can't shake the feeling that things will go sour this time.
[107:15.78]I fear my luck may have finally run out.
[107:18.68]Say, would you mind holding onto this for me?
[107:21.68]Otomo's Spirits.
[107:24.72]Should the worst befell me, it would mean a lot to me if you'd pour that over my headstone.
[107:30.39]Welcome!
[107:30.71]Alright, where's this guy's tools?
[107:32.19]We need carpentry tools.
[107:59.38]The northern ruins?
[108:00.26]Are they in the northern ruins?
[108:11.02]Wait, can I get tools in the present and bring them back to the past?
[108:19.85]Not yet.
[108:22.73]I don't remember.
[108:32.35]Can I get it here?
[108:33.03]Grr!
[109:03.35]Doc Bomb.
[109:07.35]Oh, it's Sir Gideon off me.
[109:09.73]Zero?
[109:15.80]Zero.
[109:22.76]How do I hurt this guy?
[109:23.79]Fire?
[109:25.93]Uh-oh.
[109:38.60]Uh-oh.
[109:47.54]My sword is to no avail.
[109:50.08]Glenn!
[109:52.96]Cyrus?
[109:54.64]Desire Glenn!
[109:57.22]Uh... Glenn?
[110:00.70]Grrrr!
[110:06.85]I'll go the other way for now.
[110:10.79]This shit's all fucked up too.
[110:17.89]I think I have to bring an item here.
[110:52.92]Okay, so I need tools.
[110:55.25]Where are those carpentry tools?
[110:59.63]Here you are.
[111:00.05]Bring me another mug!
[111:03.90]Sir, I think you've had quite enough already.
[111:06.60]Who are you to tell me when I've had enough?
[111:08.22]You're worse than the wife.
[111:10.01]What's wrong with a carpenter having a few pints in the afternoon, eh?
[111:13.21]Hey, you want to borrow my tools?
[111:16.57]Oh, sure, why not?
[111:17.50]Be my guest.
[111:18.04]I'm a little busy, as you can see, so you need to go and get them for my wife.
[111:29.38]All my husband does is sit at that tavern all day, nursing drinks.
[111:33.92]Well, just wait till he comes home.
[111:35.16]He'll be nursing a sore jaw then.
[111:38.43]But it's tools?
[111:40.21]Oh, hold on.
[111:41.01]Yeah, they're right here.
[111:49.75]Obtained the tools.
[111:54.69]When I grow up, I'll be a carpenter just like my dad.
[112:00.05]Careful with those tools.
[112:02.85]Now we bring him back.
[112:15.68]Alright, here you go.
[112:21.26]Are those carpentry tools you're carrying?
[112:23.45]Might you be willing to lend them to me for a while?
[112:25.63]Yes.
[112:26.99]Why, thanks, Fred.
[112:27.77]Now I can finally get to work.
[112:47.30]I think I go, wait, I gotta go back to his house?
[112:49.16]Okay.
[112:50.67]People saying go back to his house?
[112:51.73]Alright, let's say we start with the ruins up north.
[113:07.49]On your feet, you lazy do-nots.
[113:09.63]Whatever you say, master.
[113:23.82]We've done all we can.
[113:25.54]We can't repair monster-infested places.
[113:27.35]Let us know when you've cleared a floor.
[113:29.33]Besties will handle the rest.
[113:37.59]I'm gonna be taking a break here in a minute.
[113:40.99]But that lets us go over here.
[113:42.57]Hey, what?
[113:44.49]You didn't do it!
[113:48.02]You didn't even fix it!
[113:54.92]Oh, there we go.
[113:57.34]Okay.
[113:59.09]I will be right back.
[114:01.05]See you in three or four minutes.
[114:47.60]Thank you.
[115:47.69]Thank you.
[119:14.41]What's up?
[119:18.84]You guys chilling?
[119:24.18]Let's keep it going.
[119:29.92]Alright, so they repaired everything.
[119:32.18]At least they should have.
[119:33.32]At least up here.
[119:38.63]Can I kill these?
[119:55.72]1,400 damage is not enough to kill these things?
[119:59.50]Does screaming feel like you're babysitting?
[120:02.44]Um... He didn't say, he didn't say no, he didn't say no, he hates us.
[120:15.55]Too long to answer.
[120:19.73]No, actually, I was paying attention to the game.
[120:32.85]I want apple juice.
[120:36.19]No, you cannot have just apple juice.
[120:39.82]You need to eat the rest of your dinner.
[120:42.36]You cannot live off of apple juice and french fries.
[120:46.70]That's not how it works.
[120:47.84]I got one more group and then they can fix all this other crap.
[121:14.44]Mac is just so, he's so destructive.
[121:16.56]Yeah, I ain't gonna lie, I kind of like, I kind of have the urge to play Marvel Rivals again.
[121:24.00]I actually kind of want to play it again.
[121:27.94]Might play it off stream a little.
[121:38.66]The ad is now over.
[121:39.82]Yeah, the ad's over, but... I remember playing it before and it was fun.
[121:53.05]You don't have a life off stream.
[121:54.53]Stream it to us.
[121:55.53]Hey, you don't know what I'm doing off stream.
[122:01.11]What are you talking about?
[122:01.97]Alright, get back in there and fix it.
[122:08.40]2,000 gold!
[122:11.02]I'm good for it.
[122:12.64]He probably smokes big doinks?
[122:26.31]Big donks? ...
[122:38.61]Hey, what I do... We come here together.
[122:42.05]We hang out.
[122:44.87]What I do in my own time, whatever you do in your own time, too.
[122:48.78]We don't need to know.
[122:49.38]I don't need to know what you do.
[122:59.84]When you show up to the book club a few times a week here... Maybe.
[123:04.99]Might be once a week, might be fucking every day.
[123:07.53]Whatever.
[123:12.48]We just do whatever we do whatever I'm gonna do.
[123:14.54]There's no monsters here.
[123:22.89]Liar.
[123:23.41]I paid that guy 2,000 gold for him to walk in here and walk out.
[123:26.09]How long do you think you're gonna continue streaming?
[123:33.95]Two years?
[123:34.67]Five years?
[123:35.31]I definitely don't put a five on that.
[123:42.41]I have no idea.
[123:51.25]Oh, shit.
[123:55.03]You gotta remember, I already stopped.
[123:57.37]Like, two years ago.
[123:59.59]So, I... This is New Game Plus.
[124:01.47]We're already kind of... I'm just kind of doing it.
[124:05.01]Here rests Cyrus, the fool who defied Magus.
[124:15.07]Cyrus.
[124:16.49]Cyrus, I have returned.
[124:18.63]I will fulfill that oath I swore to you so long ago, and my final promise to you as well.
[124:23.69]Alright, don't fuck up.
[124:36.33]This is actually like a touching scene.
[124:38.81]Retirement equals move to the couch.
[124:43.36]That is not what it meant, but that's not inaccurate that streams after I said all that was on a couch.
[124:52.44]And I might stream from a couch sometimes too.
[124:54.60]Now, who cares?
[124:55.72]Whatever.
[125:02.86]Cyrus.
[125:05.92]Glenn, thank you for making the journey all this way.
[125:12.03]Cyrus, you must think ill of me.
[125:14.04]Ah, you think over much.
[125:18.36]You've come far, my friend.
[125:19.70]I was never a fine warrior as you are now.
[125:24.72]As Magus's fire consumed me, my heart burned with the thoughts of all I'd left unfinished.
[125:31.26]And all I left... Wait, what's he doing here?
[125:35.74]Oh, you roll with him now?
[125:37.40]You roll with him now?
[125:39.83]I'm going to take this fucking item and I'm going to bury it.
[125:44.82]Magus, King Guardia, Queen Lean, and of course you, my dear good friend.
[125:52.92]Cyrus, but the skills you've honed over all this time are superior to any I could have ever claimed to know.
[126:02.15]I can rest now, knowing that all will be made right by your hands.
[126:08.21]Farewell, my friend.
[126:11.26]Cyrus, wait!
[126:12.00]I... I... Queen.
[126:21.72]Look after the Queen.
[126:23.86]Farewell, Glenn, my friend.
[126:27.42]Cyrus!
[126:30.20]Forgive me, Cyrus.
[126:31.20]Hmm?
[126:34.50]The... The Vasamune?
[126:40.32]Ilo is like, whoa!
[126:48.84]Heh.
[126:50.56]What else?
[127:01.55]All that emotional baggage was weighing you down.
[127:05.37]The hero's strength is strength of will.
[127:08.55]Can't very well save the world if you're dwelling on the past.
[127:12.84]Now you're truly strong.
[127:16.30]True strength.
[127:18.60]And now we can use all of our power too, can't we, Masa?
[127:23.15]You bet, Moon.
[127:39.49]It's pulsing with strength!
[127:44.71]Ah, the Masamune's true form!
[127:46.71]I must go now, Cyrus.
[127:49.15]But I go to follow in your footsteps and see done all that you had wished.
[127:54.16]May my actions honor you.
[127:57.58]Come, let us be on our way.
[128:10.09]Take a look at this thing.
[128:11.41]Attack plus 200.
[128:14.91]Just to give you an idea, this is what I had on before.
[128:19.03]147.
[128:19.23]I think it's 183 now.
[128:21.07]That's crazy.
[128:23.81]The frog looks stoned in his pick.
[128:30.92]What, he's like, is that a party?
[128:35.18]Stop ruining my childhood!
[128:46.26]he's at a party like yeah man oh yeah I'm at a party I'm stoned no he said stoked oh well that's better there's more to repair
[129:16.26]Misreading chat compilation.
[129:21.59]Yeah, but I mean, it was so easy to misinterpret that.
[129:26.97]There's nowhere left that we can repair.
[129:28.49]Okay.
[129:30.37]Let's see what the... I think there's a couple other things.
[129:32.37]How does it feel you have the same hair and face as Magus?
[129:41.75]I'm pretty good.
[129:42.41]He seems like kind of a handsome guy.
[129:50.62]Ooh, one of these.
[129:52.47]The item inside is reacting to the pendant.
[129:53.99]Remove the item.
[129:54.75]Yes.
[129:58.51]Nova armor?
[130:01.47]Bro.
[130:01.83]Oh.
[130:08.76]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[130:43.41]I learned triple kick drop down dual tech Who's that?
[130:50.56]Oh
[130:58.84]These two, okay.
[130:59.76]Slam into an enemy from above.
[131:10.24]Let me check the other area first.
[131:12.94]Um, let me ask a question because this is here in the present.
[131:16.94]Should I leave some of this stuff alone?
[131:19.38]Will it just be better in the present?
[131:20.61]Like, will this be a better item in the present?
[131:26.51]I don't remember.
[131:35.28]I don't know, man.
[131:35.84]I don't know.
[131:36.22]Yes, sure.
[131:36.88]Is it going to age like wine?
[131:41.96]Don't pick up anything ever again.
[131:44.60]You can charge the chests and open them in the future.
[131:50.19]How do I charge them?
[131:56.83]You should touch the unlocked boxes then go to the present to open them.
[131:59.69]Then come back to the past and open again.
[132:01.73]Click it but don't open it.
[132:07.75]I opened it!
[132:08.29]I tried to open it!
[132:09.30]Oh, whatever.
[132:10.74]It's not gonna be a perfect playthrough.
[132:12.42]Fuck.
[132:18.45]You already opened the sealed chest?
[132:20.23]It's a different one.
[132:21.05]Oh, shit.
[132:21.53]Whatever.
[132:28.38]It was just an elixir.
[132:35.94]Okay, this is there.
[132:39.28]Here rest the brave Sir Cyrus, whose spirit lives on in his true friend, Glenn.
[132:48.58]Five magic capsules behind the grave.
[133:03.97]You can open them in the present first and then the past so you can open them twice.
[133:07.40]I think I've kind of already sealed my fate here.
[133:12.78]Did I get everything on this side?
[133:17.32]I did.
[133:18.46]Alright, one last room.
[133:31.56]Can you wish that guy good luck on his exam?
[133:37.61]I don't know what he's examining.
[133:39.49]I don't know what that means.
[133:41.65]Examining what, like frogs?
[133:43.87]Examining... What does that mean?
[133:48.80]What exam?
[133:51.42]What if it's like a mad scientist exam?
[133:53.86]Can't just blanket give a statement like that.
[134:13.93]Do you really want to piss off a mad scientist?
[134:19.65]Mad scientists are kind of just... they're not really that useful.
[134:22.67]And then you can just push these people over.
[134:29.50]Mad scientist has such a shit career.
[134:43.14]They're the weakest?
[134:44.96]And, oh, well, you turned that guy's brain into cotton candy.
[134:48.49]Okay, who gives a shit?
[134:49.65]I can just push you and you go, Ah!
[134:51.43]Ah!
[135:07.89]Yeah, turn this into candy.
[135:09.69]And you just like spin kick him in the head.
[135:11.36]And he just, he's never going to get up.
[135:37.23]Alright, so I shouldn't touch these.
[135:38.37]Alright, so do not open these.
[135:48.51]Open them in the present.
[135:50.87]Touch but don't open.
[135:51.81]No.
[135:57.11]No.
[136:06.34]Hey, the babysitter's blood sugar is low.
[136:09.68]What does that mean?
[136:15.28]No, what do you mean?
[136:16.16]No, what did you mean by that?
[136:17.16]What did you mean?
[136:17.88]Tell me what you meant by that.
[136:22.38]I'm easy to anger now because I haven't eaten.
[136:24.98]I'm kind of like hangry or something.
[136:26.75]Explain it.
[136:27.75]I want it explained and I don't want you to send us too much.
[136:32.47]To have us understand if we should be banning you or not.
[136:36.36]Little asshole.
[136:46.41]Oh, mad scientists turn you into tasty candy.
[136:49.21]You listed only, what, I listed only one example of what a mad scientist does?
[136:54.33]They don't turn everything into candy.
[136:58.38]Yeah, but they turn, like they do though!
[137:02.64]I invented a sneeze machine watch and it's just like a human head that they press a button and it goes realistic boogers come out it's like dude fuck off do something useful
[137:29.67]Yeah, never is it.
[137:30.63]I invented a machine that eats plastic and removes it from the atmosphere!
[137:34.27]No, no, keep making the, like, candy bone machine.
[137:43.62]It turns your bones into candy!
[137:45.56]Ooh, how diabolical!
[138:05.10]Alright, let's see if it was worth it.
[138:07.54]It took hundreds of years for this to happen.
[138:12.92]Dude.
[138:14.92]Onimaru upgraded into Suzaku.
[138:18.13]Shit.
[138:22.49]I didn't do this to the other one.
[138:24.67]Siren's Kiss upgraded to Valkyrie Bow.
[138:35.30]times four damage for critical hits.
[138:38.96]Well, we're never going to see this because Corona's not on the party.
[138:46.02]Damn.
[138:59.61]Shit, this could have been so much better.
[139:01.45]I fucked up the whole playthrough.
[139:03.97]This could have been upgraded to something else.
[139:09.42]That stinks.
[139:11.91]I'm just gonna reset the whole game.
[139:13.27]I'll start from the beginning.
[139:14.71]For those that didn't see the first part of the playthrough, I'll just start the whole game over.
[139:28.34]That's pretty reasonable.
[139:29.68]Yeah.
[139:33.23]Okay, so now I should be able to go to the left, right?
[139:36.25]Because we did all that.
[139:39.83]Cyrus's ghost shouldn't be angry anymore.
[139:48.72]Oh wait, where is Cyrus's ghost in the present?
[139:50.46]Oh.
[140:03.74]It was a turbo ether.
[140:05.22]Damn.
[140:11.72]The upgraded one is worse.
[140:24.37]I'd get so frustrated with myself I'd have to come back four months later.
[140:38.30]Alright, we got Frog's stuff.
[140:42.33]So Frog has got pretty much maxed out stuff.
[140:45.69]Magus has pretty much maxed out stuff.
[140:47.37]Attack power grows when allies are KO'd.
[140:53.10]Oh, that's interesting.
[141:08.00]wait a minute oh no here lies the great explorer thoma levine 6 the third moon 634. wait a minute
[141:40.37]Frog, it's been many a day.
[141:43.14]I located the rainbow shell, as it were.
[141:48.08]To the northwest of this cape is a large island called the Giant's Claw.
[141:52.60]The shell is there.
[142:03.15]But beware, there are droves of monsters afoot there.
[142:07.71]Well, then I believe this is farewell.
[142:12.22]He went right to heaven.
[142:15.40]All the best to you!
[142:16.00]Wait, wasn't he like... Boston?
[142:17.43]Oops.
[142:17.59]I told you to look behind the grave.
[142:18.69]Speed capsule.
[142:19.21]That's huge.
[142:43.83]Ah, frog.
[142:46.03]Max that speed out.
[142:47.11]Hey, if you're watching this as video-on-demand content, if you're watching this on the VOD channel, by the way, the Stream Archive channel, if you missed some streams, pull entire VODs of every stream I have ever done.
[143:12.47]dating back almost a decade.
[143:14.65]Although they're on the stream archive channel.
[143:18.45]And if you want to check out highlights, if you did you miss something but you don't have quite that much time, check out the second channel, which has usually a day or two after a stream happens or within a week, there's a a small condensed highlighted version of the stream that you may have missed.
[143:36.48]Check them both out.
[143:39.20]Actually do.
[143:39.90]Actually you should.
[143:45.20]Alright.
[143:47.21]Let's do it.
[143:50.45]Wait, I already forgot where he said to go.
[143:54.61]Isn't it right here?
[143:55.13]Is the omen in the way?
[143:56.31]No.
[143:56.47]Where is it?
[144:05.28]Giant's Claw, right?
[144:06.24]Oh, here it is.
[144:13.56]Wait, where is it?
[144:22.72]Yeah, why am I so lost?
[144:23.82]Isn't it right here?
[144:29.87]Does it have to be in the other time period?
[144:41.54]There it is.
[144:45.16]Alright, let's get the rainbow shell.
[144:58.30]Upon clicking the link, I got a reminder at the Stream Archive channel's page of how you still haven't gone back to The Sims 2 since you played it in February.
[145:05.60]Hope you stream it again.
[145:06.62]I said yes to more of it in the poll.
[145:08.46]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[145:15.03]Did you hear about what happened to those two, though?
[145:19.49]They one crashed, the bus into the other one?
[145:29.19]Oh shit, this looks fucked up.
[145:31.35]Is that having fun pretending to be... Wait, we have to see everybody's.
[145:39.87]Hers might be my favorite.
[146:04.63]He doesn't do that too, does he?
[146:06.81]Magus is not allowed to have any fun.
[146:08.15]He doesn't do anything fun.
[146:12.19]Oh my guys!
[146:14.61]Come on!
[146:16.05]Come on!
[146:16.85]There's a little smile there.
[146:18.43]Okay.
[146:19.63]He's having a little fun.
[146:22.79]What?
[146:23.33]Why a Reptide Castle here?
[146:27.49]When Lavos fell, this place must have been buried within the Earth.
[146:30.92]And here it yet lies.
[146:41.00]Lightning, right?
[146:42.14]Good thing we got Magus.
[146:52.95]He might kill everybody in one hit here.
[147:00.33]Damn.
[147:01.77]Mass of Moon might destroy here.
[147:09.41]374, regular hit.
[147:11.30]Oof.
[147:18.96]Shield sphere.
[147:19.68]I think I have a couple of these already.
[147:27.17]Okay.
[147:35.94]Stop it.
[147:37.82]Eww.
[148:02.19]These are dinosaurs.
[148:03.73]I thought heel was supposed to... Wait, what?
[148:09.99]No, not this shit again.
[148:11.93]I love to eat.
[148:13.21]Eat.
[148:13.98]Eat.
[148:14.98]Apples and bananas.
[148:16.22]I love to eat.
[148:30.55]That one person actually ruined everything.
[148:36.37]These guys are so annoying.
[148:37.43]At least I didn't miss.
[148:51.74]And after eight, eight, eight bananas.
[149:01.98]It's barely even there.
[149:03.94]It's... It is 25% there.
[149:06.10]No!
[149:29.35]Shit.
[149:34.11]We can save the cat.
[149:37.65]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[149:47.45]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[149:50.05]I did the every video game thing.
[149:51.61]Sorry.
[149:53.49]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[150:03.16]There's more to see.
[150:12.39]Is ice better for these or what?
[150:18.82]Yeah.
[150:29.30]Dark Mist.
[151:04.59]There are a lot of places in this dungeon.
[151:12.98]What?
[151:16.18]Are you kidding me?
[151:20.60]We, we, we, we don't give a fuck.
[151:28.17]That kind of works.
[151:36.39]I gotta fight these guys a third time.
[151:38.83]We, we, we, we don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck.
[151:44.56]We don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck.
[151:47.88]We don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck.
[151:54.47]We don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck.
[152:00.17]Thanks, I love that song.
[152:04.95]Alright, I'm gonna be doing 25% less wearing from now on.
[152:15.87]I gotta clean my act up a little.
[152:34.00]I've wasted two or three shelters already.
[152:42.37]Why?
[152:48.39]It's empty.
[152:53.91]Huh?
[152:55.31]Can I not press this?
[152:57.39]I guess not.
[153:07.12]We go down.
[153:07.80]Okay, now lightning should be fine.
[153:14.85]Only 300.
[153:15.01]I thought it was going to be way more than that.
[153:48.29]Did you know that the Godskin Noble duo theme is just take me out to the ball game?
[153:52.73]I can't unhear it.
[153:56.26]What do you mean?
[154:04.78]What are you talking about?
[154:19.54]Godskin Apostles boss theme.
[154:50.77]Rip Vaad?
[154:51.57]It's Elden Ring.
[154:53.09]We're playing Elden Ring.
[154:57.51]At 1, 2, 3?
[154:57.73]Rip me out of the crowd.
[155:13.83]Find me some peanuts and crackers... No, it's not!
[155:20.11]No, it's not!
[155:26.19]Okay, take me out to the crowd!
[155:37.98]Stop ruining everybody's childhood!
[155:49.69]Oh no.
[155:51.75]Dinosaurs.
[155:52.27]Ouch.
[156:16.09]I'm glad I'm leveling up, though.
[156:24.55]Kiss.
[156:26.55]Kill is kiss.
[156:28.43]Kill is kiss.
[156:45.24]I either
[156:50.53]Strength.
[156:51.95]That goes to Isla.
[157:02.68]Make sure I don't miss it.
[157:03.74]Oh.
[157:15.67]I'm going to do triple kick.
[157:18.47]She just learned this.
[157:32.46]If you were an instrument, you'd be a 7th century organ nobody was ever allowed to touch.
[157:36.84]But there were stories written about how good it sounded and everyone wanted to hear it.
[157:42.01]Ah, that move was ridiculous.
[157:44.91]That was 1800 damage.
[157:49.03]Is that her ultimate tech?
[157:51.09]That was insane.
[157:55.80]Blue gemstone.
[157:58.48]Is that what we were talking about before?
[158:13.53]Enables Omega Flare triple tech.
[158:17.77]Omega Flare.
[158:25.24]Cool.
[158:36.34]Cool.
[158:40.60]Always good to get another one of those.
[158:49.78]This place is huge.
[158:50.62]I feel like I'm missing a lot of stuff.
[158:53.20]It's alright though.
[159:06.87]Is this stream accepting of high people?
[159:08.75]Yeah, just chill though.
[159:19.63]As long as you chill about it.
[159:20.47]I want that.
[159:40.22]Look at how strong Isla is.
[159:42.14]78.
[159:42.26]I didn't step on it?
[159:58.08]Dark mist.
[159:59.62]Attack all enemies with darkness.
[160:01.24]Okay, that is single-handedly going to kill a lot of us.
[160:24.02]I just want everyone to know.
[160:32.73]Ouch.
[160:33.73]That's good too.
[160:34.29]Okay.
[160:51.42]These things give a million experience, right?
[160:55.04]I should give Berserker Ring.
[161:09.88]Alright, let's do it.
[161:19.67]Nice.
[161:26.61]Nice.
[161:28.73]There we go.
[161:29.33]Alright, that's big.
[161:29.92]1,000 experience, 100 TP.
[161:31.40]Do it again.
[161:41.96]Pizza versus tacos.
[161:47.76]That's rough.
[161:48.66]I don't think I can give you an answer.
[162:01.25]Hey!
[162:02.95]Not cool.
[162:10.08]I would say...
[162:18.60]I don't know.
[162:22.54]My gut reaction is pizza.
[162:24.60]I would keep pizza.
[162:33.18]I don't know if I could live without pizza.
[162:36.18]But then again, I don't know if I could live without tacos either.
[162:51.36]I'm gonna say, oh man, but getting a nice ground beef taco with just the crunchy skin.
[163:00.45]Crispy shell.
[163:10.21]That like crispy taco skin.
[163:21.21]what is he talking about what the fuck is he saying mods mods ping him mods ping him mods what's wrong what is he saying uh oh it's about to get real oh it is about to get real we got lightning right
[163:59.23]You care?
[163:59.65]Oh!
[164:07.35]Don't go that way!
[164:15.84]Oh, shit!
[164:16.64]Okay, she has the thing on, but I think it's fine.
[164:18.80]She just did 1100 damage.
[164:35.21]Yeah, just let her do whatever she's gonna do.
[164:38.53]Whatever, who cares?
[164:39.29]She'll be fine.
[164:40.65]She already got to go again.
[164:42.83]She's so fast.
[164:45.93]I'm gonna wipe the floor with this boss.
[164:51.28]I'm going for a kill before we even get to zero.
[164:54.70]This team is actually pretty good.
[165:02.84]That's a third crit in a row.
[165:08.71]I think I'm just going for just a regular attack.
[165:10.57]Mass of Moon?
[165:11.89]Yeah.
[165:24.52]Wow.
[165:24.78]Let's keep doing it.
[165:32.14]Are we gonna get five crits in a row?
[165:37.25]Maybe.
[165:40.17]Aw.
[165:52.36]Dark mist.
[165:52.98]I need a hero medal on frog.
[165:57.90]Ah, that's true.
[166:02.96]It's good too.
[166:03.36]What about water?
[166:07.60]Is water good?
[166:16.46]Alright, here comes whatever it is.
[166:17.61]I'm gonna make sure Frog has... time.
[166:24.87]I want Frog to be able to heal because I think we're about to get smoked.
[166:30.56]Dark Fist is better.
[166:37.98]What Dark Bomb?
[166:46.82]Still the same.
[166:55.78]Not even a problem at all.
[166:57.98]We're good.
[166:58.62]Lavos is so dead.
[167:01.56]And I mean dead dead.
[167:22.76]We're close.
[167:26.80]The only other move, you're done.
[167:37.50]And it's crazy because Magus has the thing where I can just do this over and over again.
[167:43.81]That 75% reduction is... dirty.
[167:55.71]Rock and heal.
[168:01.67]That heal is really good now.
[168:04.09]All the magic tabs or whatever.
[168:09.84]Flame strengthen.
[168:10.92]Oh, don't get too comfortable.
[168:25.07]There it is.
[168:28.52]Level up.
[168:31.30]Give me that rainbow shell.
[168:37.20]Very strong team.
[168:42.81]There it is.
[168:46.35]Pretty big.
[168:47.25]This rainbow shell can eat?
[168:48.75]Why does she always want to eat it?
[168:57.80]It is far too heavy for these hands alone.
[169:00.12]Let us seek counsel with the king.
[169:01.46]We've got to get people to come in and get it.
[169:08.03]Alright, give me a hand with this one.
[169:13.07]I don't remember what you do with this.
[169:15.43]I know you have to go to the Guardia Kingdom.
[169:17.72]And there's a couple other things you do too, right?
[169:25.06]Something troubling you?
[169:28.14]We have a favor to ask of you.
[169:30.82]I see.
[169:31.54]So you wish for me to safeguard the shell you found on that island within the castle for future generations?
[169:38.84]Grant them this small favor.
[169:39.94]It is little enough to ask.
[169:43.32]Very well.
[169:44.58]I shall have the shell brought to the castle and stored in our vaults as a royal heirloom.
[169:49.99]Commander!
[169:52.29]Yes, Majesty?
[169:54.83]Go to the Giant's Claw and retrieve for me this rainbow shell.
[169:58.84]At once.
[169:59.74]Yes, Majesty.
[170:05.41]Your graciousness, humblest, one so undeserving as I. Very well.
[170:12.09]Okay.
[170:14.43]Frog, I offer you my thanks to you again.
[170:16.03]The valor of your deeds is worthy of the name of a knight.
[170:19.95]Your Majesty, please do not waste such words of honor on me.
[170:22.78]He's now Knight Frog.
[170:34.71]I don't know, guys.
[170:36.03]I think we've heard this enough.
[171:00.11]That's the last time we're seeing that character.
[171:04.37]He gets hit by a fucking meteor in the end of the game.
[171:07.33]Unfortunate.
[171:07.83]Alright, so now let's go to the present.
[171:42.44]It's the terrorists!
[171:44.62]Wait, what?
[171:46.18]What's a terrorist?
[171:49.26]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[171:50.60]What happened to... Wait, what?
[171:57.39]I need Marle.
[171:58.39]Oh, shit.
[171:58.99]Okay.
[172:06.41]Oh, Princess Nadia!
[172:09.68]You had me worried, princess.
[172:10.94]I understand your feelings, of course.
[172:12.74]The king places his realm above all else.
[172:15.32]It was the same even when your mother queen, Eliza, passed away.
[172:19.76]What?
[172:21.42]Oh, child, please forgive... Forget that I spoke.
[172:25.80]Tell me.
[172:27.55]It's difficult to speak of even now.
[172:29.67]You see, Queen Eliza's condition had been frail for some time.
[172:34.04]But it took a sudden turn for the worse near the end.
[172:37.12]She desperately wanted to see your father just one last time.
[172:41.10]It's a shame, really.
[172:45.30]But your father refused.
[172:47.22]Said he could not leave his work unattended.
[172:50.10]He left you, young, innocent, and knowing nothing of death, to watch over her alone.
[172:57.04]Naturally, the end was not long in the coming.
[172:59.02]She died soon after.
[173:00.44]One might well say the king killed her.
[173:04.42]Such a shame.
[173:08.13]Father killed her?
[173:10.53]Please, I speak too much.
[173:12.21]Do not let it trouble you, your highness.
[173:15.97]Now that you've finally returned, won't you go and see the king?
[173:19.35]And here, drink this.
[173:21.15]Weird, cloudy liquid that's not poisonous.
[173:25.94]All three of you,
[173:29.13]Chancellor has ordered that the interior of the castle be sealed off until the trial is over.
[173:41.77]And I'm coming up on a break.
[173:44.22]Get up and move around.
[173:45.04]I will be back in three minutes.
[173:51.02]Still going.
[173:53.58]Fear beat.
[175:02.38]Thanks for watching!
[176:35.14]Thanks for watching!
[178:13.48]How's it going?
[178:39.71]Omeglel, is this the shpee guy?
[178:41.41]How dare you.
[178:45.71]How dare you.
[178:53.90]Okay.
[178:54.82]So, uh, trial.
[178:56.08]The theory of the cast be sealed off until the trial is over.
[179:09.38]Same thing on the left.
[179:10.62]Wait, were the stairs over there before?
[179:18.49]Were they?
[179:21.07]Nobody can get inside.
[179:22.75]We're the snakes.
[179:24.89]This is the treasury, no entry permitted.
[179:26.96]Turbo Ether.
[179:37.85]It's locked.
[179:47.13]Entry is forbidden.
[179:49.72]Let me through!
[179:56.42]Good citizens, have any of you heard of the royal heirloom known as the Rainbow Shell?
[180:03.72]I too had no idea of his existence, until I laid eyes upon this, that is.
[180:11.27]I hold before you an ancestral will written by the hand of our own king's distant forebearers,
[180:18.94]If I may.
[180:21.47]Unveil the rainbow shell to the people at the Millennial Fair that they might enjoy the blessing of our royal treasure.
[180:28.59]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[180:32.35]We have no ancient royal heirlooms here.
[180:38.10]Surely you don't intend to claim this as forgery?
[180:41.94]I ask you, good people of the court, why does the defendant deny you a glimpse of this glorious rainbow shell?
[180:49.13]Why?
[180:50.07]Because he no longer owns it.
[180:53.09]He sold a priceless heirloom of our kingdom for no other reason than his own greed.
[180:58.39]Witness, if you would please.
[181:02.50]Princess, we are conducting a trial here.
[181:05.22]Father!
[181:05.42]Father!
[181:10.64]Adia, the Chancellor is trying to frame me.
[181:15.56]Let us not hurl insults.
[181:17.50]If you are innocent, it should be simple enough to confirm the matter with proof.
[181:22.74]Proof?
[181:24.24]Yes, if His Grace has not sold the heirloom, it should remain within the castle.
[181:29.20]Bring the rainbow shell before the court, and his innocence will be beyond question.
[181:34.52]Not that I expect you will succeed.
[181:36.89]Ha, ha, ha.
[181:40.56]Chancellor, what kind of trickery is this?
[181:42.74]Remove them!
[181:53.03]Entry is forbidden.
[181:55.59]Let me through!
[181:58.65]I'm sorry, my lady.
[181:59.55]Not even you may enter.
[182:02.98]Had we the rainbow shell, we could prove his innocence.
[182:06.88]What are you talking about?
[182:07.82]The Chancellor made up the entire thing.
[182:09.77]There is no heirloom.
[182:11.87]Have you forgotten?
[182:12.49]History is changed.
[182:15.37]The shell should lie within the castle now.
[182:17.33]Ah, the rainbow shell we gave to my ancestor 400 years ago must still be here.
[182:28.12]It's probably in the basement.
[182:29.00]Let's go.
[182:42.45]I told you this chef was dead.
[182:55.23]Uh, we should give... Does she have to be in the party?
[182:58.07]She might have to be in the party.
[183:02.95]If that's the case, she's got the best item that she can get.
[183:10.79]She is slow though.
[183:25.00]Oh shit, knocked out.
[183:26.76]A rat bit my toe.
[183:29.00]Good rat.
[183:31.34]Ah, snakes.
[183:32.56]I see we have some intruders.
[183:36.26]The boss is finally going to settle the score on his 13 generation old family grudge.
[183:42.46]Yeah, he's going to frame the king with good... Yeah.
[183:48.84]Humans!
[183:52.88]No, brother!
[183:58.71]Evil doesn't pay.
[184:03.97]Ice toss.
[184:05.03]Ice water.
[184:07.59]So there is a plot.
[184:08.53]We'd better hurry.
[184:14.25]Yes.
[184:15.28]I bought it from the king.
[184:17.34]I wasn't sure if I should, but... Well, he looked so desperate for the money.
[184:22.66]Liar!
[184:23.64]I've never seen you before.
[184:27.98]Order!
[184:28.64]Order in the court!
[184:32.33]Was I convincing?
[184:33.11]Perfect.
[184:34.57]Perfect.
[184:43.33]Come on, hurry!
[184:44.51]We gotta get through!
[184:45.17]That's a lot of treasure back here.
[184:53.92]Lapis.
[184:56.58]Elixir.
[184:58.12]Turbo Ether.
[184:58.84]Can I not get the other ones?
[185:00.95]I hate that.
[185:09.01]I'm gonna get you!
[185:10.01]I'm gonna get you!
[185:10.87]I'm gonna get you!
[185:14.53]I gotta take the ring off of Isla.
[185:29.82]Speed.
[185:32.34]Beep.
[185:37.20]I can't even do the voice right now.
[185:39.07]I can't even do it.
[185:42.15]That's my favorite sound effect in the game.
[185:45.07]It's one of the top three.
[185:54.36]Damn.
[185:54.50]This thing's kind of good.
[186:04.71]You see the new Naked Gun trailer?
[186:07.73]Yeah, I did.
[186:08.39]I gotta tell you.
[186:10.39]I can't get excited for remakes.
[186:12.97]I can't get excited for them.
[186:16.26]Or reimaginings.
[186:17.49]And I can't.
[186:22.81]I can't think of one time where I genuinely was very happy with a true movie reimagining.
[186:32.83]It's technically a sequel, but, I mean, you know, it's still, it's like, hey, this thing that was from 30 years ago, let's do it again.
[186:44.66]I just can't get excited for them.
[186:53.05]Could it be really funny?
[186:55.25]Maybe.
[186:55.62]Probably.
[186:56.16]I don't know.
[186:57.82]But I love the Naked Gun movies.
[187:00.96]And the original TV show that they're based on.
[187:04.12]And... I just don't want to be like, Yeah!
[187:08.26]Yo!
[187:08.64]Let's go!
[187:09.28]I can't wait!
[187:09.86]It's going to be so awesome!
[187:11.35]Oh my god!
[187:11.99]Naked Gun!
[187:12.69]Remember?
[187:14.06]Because I'll watch it in the theaters, and if it's not exactly what I'm looking for, I'm gonna go, Ah, shit.
[187:20.70]And I'm gonna turn to my board, my chalkboard, with good remakes on the left with a line down the middle, and next to that is bad remakes.
[187:31.93]And I'm going to just put another tally onto bad remake.
[187:37.91]And the over on good, the good side has like one thing on it.
[187:41.31]So I need to be, I gotta be proven wrong.
[187:44.86]You bring a chalkboard to the movie theater?
[187:50.60]What a weirdo.
[187:57.51]What's the one good remake?
[188:01.05]Alright, this is not even a movie, but, and people hate me for this, but I think the Demon's Souls remake is like the best fucking remake.
[188:08.21]Diablo II's remake was good.
[188:10.37]Demon's Souls, these are video games.
[188:16.89]Dune?
[188:17.65]I've not seen Dune.
[188:21.69]Games are different.
[188:22.73]Shadow of the Colossus?
[188:23.65]Yeah, I'm thinking about movies.
[188:26.59]I can't even give you one because I don't think there has been one.
[188:30.42]I do not think there's been one that I've actually thought was good.
[188:36.48]Dune is an adaptation, yeah.
[188:40.06]The Thing?
[188:40.60]I didn't see The Thing remake.
[188:43.31]You're talking about the one from like 10 years ago?
[188:44.67]5 years ago?
[188:47.09]The Thing actually was a good one?
[188:48.70]Because they've remade The Thing a few years ago.
[189:00.01]The John Carpenter one.
[189:01.29]Okay.
[189:02.93]Yeah, the original version was a remake already.
[189:04.73]Yes.
[189:09.42]Godzilla 2014.
[189:17.20]21 Jump Street was a remake.
[189:21.58]Hairspray was a remake.
[189:26.77]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[189:27.67]Dearest Marl.
[189:29.43]Uh, TL;DR.
[189:32.93]I don't get excited for anything remake.
[189:35.08]But the Demon's Souls remake was fucking phenomenal.
[189:37.72]And I'll die on that hill.
[189:51.77]We're gonna get a Ster Demon's Souls playthrough, by the way.
[189:54.89]I'm gonna make sure we see it.
[189:59.48]That Demon's Souls remake, I remember.
[190:03.14]I got... I'm just playing through that on an OLED.
[190:09.14]It is the most crispy, crunchy, peanut buttery.
[190:13.12]It is so beautiful.
[190:14.33]It is like the most beautiful game ever made.
[190:16.31]The Demon's Souls remake is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.
[190:19.73]Ever.
[190:20.93]Ever.
[190:21.93]On an OLED.
[190:22.45]It just, oh my god, it's incredible.
[190:24.69]It is the single greatest looking game I think of all time.
[190:35.49]Glazing, that's fine.
[190:37.29]I sat there, and I remember when the edible kicked in, and I was at the, I think it was, what is it?
[190:43.93]The place with the gargoyles.
[190:46.57]I think it was at 5-1 or 5-2, what's it called?
[190:50.73]The place with the gargoyles.
[191:01.14]Tower of Latria.
[191:03.50]It's where everything is kind of green.
[191:06.24]It's like green and orange lights.
[191:08.70]It's so beautiful.
[191:18.75]Demon's Souls Remake is the only game worth be called next-gen graphics.
[191:22.05]Other games haven't caught up.
[191:27.66]Yeah, all I'm saying is, I know that that is a, it's polarizing to say that I love Demon's Souls.
[191:34.10]I, it's one of my, it's probably in the top three, the original one, of, FromSoftware games for me.
[191:39.78]I love it.
[191:40.68]It's in a different place for me.
[191:41.70]It's in a museum.
[191:43.25]It is locked away in a, in a nice, beautiful case, and you walk by it, and you play it, and you go, man, oh wow, it's a beautiful museum piece.
[191:51.53]Artifact.
[191:52.21]Keep it in the glass.
[191:56.14]But that remake, I would be lying if I didn't tell you, I thought it was one of the best experiences I've had in a long time.
[192:01.87]At least visually.
[192:04.17]Stop yammering.
[192:05.41]I'm yammering!
[192:09.14]The Demon's Souls remake looks like it was made in dreams, but worse.
[192:12.90]No!
[192:13.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[192:16.32]No, no, no!
[192:21.76]I told Ster, I was like, do you gotta play it?
[192:24.82]Ster has an OLED, and he's never played it.
[192:26.92]I was like, dude, get it on your OLED, put HDR on maximum, and just sit there with your mouth open and drool at those fucking gorgeous, the fire, the flames going into... Ugh.
[192:41.50]This is selling me on it?
[192:42.60]I'm not kidding.
[192:44.26]Trust me.
[192:45.85]You're gonna hate it, but I don't care.
[192:57.31]Your mind has been melted by edibles?
[193:00.41]No, it has not.
[193:01.33]I haven't had... I haven't had... Dude, I... So, okay.
[193:09.84]I was a little bit hard when I played Demon's Souls one fucking time.
[193:14.26]Oh, no.
[193:20.19]You're fried.
[193:20.77]I am not fried!
[193:26.41]You refunded the game after three hours, you're glazing?
[193:32.00]You refunded the Demon's Souls remake after three hours?
[193:34.76]No, you didn't, did you?
[193:37.26]Um, no.
[193:37.82]That's impossible.
[193:48.83]He's gonna say the lava lamp he has is game of the year when he has an edible.
[193:54.62]Alright, let's get back to Chrono Trigger before I fucking freak out.
[194:06.63]The Demon's Souls PS5 remake is like the only reason to truly own that console.
[194:13.79]And that's fine.
[194:14.61]I will stand up and I'll take the 20 crossbow bolts into the face.
[194:21.43]Okay.
[194:26.77]Buy the original for cheaper?
[194:29.35]I own them both.
[194:30.33]I have them both.
[194:31.27]I have the PS3 one.
[194:32.50]I've got the... I've got the... I have it.
[194:34.38]I own it.
[194:35.36]It's one of my favorite games ever.
[194:36.58]Okay.
[194:43.38]Nothing can break the bonds of blood.
[194:45.28]Neither distance, nor words of anger.
[194:47.67]Someday you will leave the nest and have children of your own.
[194:50.49]Then you will understand the truth of what I say.
[194:53.87]See?
[194:54.95]Someday you guys are gonna get it.
[195:00.33]I muted the stream and I thought he was just sitting here in silence fuming.
[195:07.81]Blood is the sap that flows through the limbs of a family tree and come.
[195:14.30]This, this, let me tell you, man, there is no way that I would be able to keep my mouth shut for that long without, no, there's no way.
[195:26.23]If you think that I would be able to sit here and not say anything for two or three straight minutes, there's no way.
[195:38.79]Queen Lean.
[195:40.43]Time wastes.
[195:41.55]Let us finish what we came to do.
[195:45.42]Yeah, they already executed the king by now.
[195:49.30]Hang in there, father.
[195:50.10]We're coming.
[195:53.52]Obtained the Rainbow Shard.
[195:59.27]Guilty.
[195:59.47]We gotta go!
[196:31.61]No!
[196:49.83]I got one... I'll give you one thing, all the Demon's Souls remake haters.
[196:54.01]Here's the one thing, and I get it.
[196:56.01]Last thing I'll say about it.
[196:58.16]The facial animation?
[197:00.10]Delete it.
[197:00.92]Just get rid of it.
[197:01.86]What a terrible idea that was.
[197:03.44]What a truly fucking stupid idea that was.
[197:06.14]The, like, talking facial animations are some of the worst.
[197:09.27]I agree with you.
[197:11.34]It kind of ruins the FromSoftware kind of feel.
[197:15.32]I get that.
[197:16.44]The rest of the entire experience was like a 9.7.
[197:20.63]The verdict is about to be handed down.
[197:35.15]The Chancellor has ordered that no one be allowed to enter.
[197:43.00]Can we get there through the soup?
[197:50.79]How do I get there?
[198:07.04]Not even... you can't enter.
[198:09.13]You really won't reconsider?
[198:11.41]No, Princess, I really won't.
[198:12.67]There's one other way.
[198:14.89]It's a bit rough, but just follow me.
[198:16.15]The verdict has been reached.
[198:25.52]Four votes of guilty to a single of not guilty.
[198:29.95]Defendant has been found guilty as charged.
[198:34.56]If you watched your playthrough, you hated the game.
[198:38.24]No, no, you... No.
[198:40.92]You're misconstruing how I play FromSoftware games.
[198:46.61]Every FromSoftware game I've ever played, I've told you it's the worst game I've ever played.
[198:51.87]Throughout the whole playthrough, I talk about how, like, what a terrible decision this was.
[198:54.95]This is impossible.
[198:56.29]What an awful game this is.
[198:58.07]Truly terrible.
[199:00.76]Like, how could anyone like this?
[199:03.36]I say that through the whole 40 to 50 straight hours.
[199:07.64]And every, like, five hours, I talk about how it's my favorite game.
[199:17.29]And then in retrospect, I go back and think, holy shit, what an amazing time that was.
[199:26.71]The line of Guardia has ended.
[199:28.35]This kingdom shall be mine!
[199:34.75]Take him away.
[199:37.52]Wait!
[199:39.20]Who's that?
[199:39.54]Who's that?
[199:40.04]Who's that?
[199:52.05]Father!
[199:56.15]Whoa.
[199:59.44]Damn.
[200:00.92]Just jumping right through.
[200:02.10]No, not when the whole thing was a setup.
[200:08.76]The treasure's right here.
[200:33.57]Give it up, Chancellor.
[200:34.45]Your little scheme failed.
[200:39.95]Eh.
[200:41.79]Huh?
[200:44.65]Yeah.
[200:46.95]You're the one who should better give up.
[200:49.53]If I can't avenge my ancestors the easy way, I'll do it here and now the hard way!
[200:56.46]Super Ultra Presto Transformo!
[201:08.28]Oh shit!
[201:18.47]Fifteen hundred.
[201:20.55]He's dead.
[201:25.49]We'll do Ice Toss.
[201:33.54]Oh my god!
[201:37.17]Did I make a mistake?
[201:38.67]Not having this be a part of the party?
[201:40.97]Do that again.
[202:10.08]I might need to heal.
[202:17.64]The frog is the dedicated healer.
[202:19.40]That's why he's getting all the magic stuff, because more than 200, 220, that's really good.
[202:26.51]No, it isn't.
[202:26.99]I don't even know anything about the game.
[202:31.01]Okay.
[202:41.43]Twin Charm?
[202:51.31]White Plate.
[202:52.23]Damn.
[202:52.77]Alright, cool.
[202:53.67]What?
[202:54.63]Marle is awesome!
[202:59.32]I heard about you from your ancestors.
[203:00.86]Your weakness is... this!
[203:05.84]Black Sludge!
[203:08.76]Actually, kinda true.
[203:27.61]Needle Spin version 13.
[203:28.63]I kind of want to try that.
[203:38.40]Oh, somebody's missing mana.
[204:03.28]I'll try drop down, this is a new move we got.
[204:12.48]That was 3000!
[204:15.32]I don't think I've seen a number that high.
[204:19.64]I actually don't think I've seen a number that high in the game.
[204:38.59]She's a box art character?
[204:39.79]Of course she's OP.
[204:46.17]Okay, look at how much MP that takes.
[204:47.84]20.
[204:49.06]That's why it's so crazy.
[205:00.56]Ouch.
[205:10.08]Oh my god.
[205:13.77]Not again!
[205:14.49]I'm alright.
[205:24.26]That was 6,000 damage in two turns.
[205:39.74]Father, I... No, don't say it.
[205:42.89]I was wrong to be so stubborn.
[205:46.71]No, I didn't even think about how you must have felt.
[205:49.53]Oh, I know what I want to say, but the words just won't come out.
[205:52.29]It's the same for me.
[205:56.62]There was a time when I truly thought you were lost.
[206:00.38]But when I think about it now, I realize that it was I who abandoned you.
[206:10.61]But I'm here now.
[206:11.53]We'll talk about everything from now on.
[206:15.85]I'll ask you for advice and tell you about Crono.
[206:18.10]And ask you about Mother and... I like your mother, Elijah.
[206:23.82]No shame to admit it.
[206:24.64]It's taken me until now to understand what she meant with those final words.
[206:29.88]Someday when Nadia is older, she'll bring someone she loves to meet you.
[206:34.63]Welcome the two of them with open arms.
[206:37.33]She said that would make it a day you would remember forever.
[206:44.41]You heard her last words?
[206:48.04]Of course.
[206:49.90]You were so young, you probably don't remember.
[206:52.58]You kept saying, Eddie, I love lots of people.
[206:56.16]Lots and lots.
[206:58.34]It reassured your mother, seeing you so happy.
[207:01.96]She left us with a smile on her face.
[207:08.80]So that's how it was.
[207:12.14]Yes, why?
[207:23.67]I used to call you Daddy?
[207:25.13]You did.
[207:34.19]I'm sorry, Daddy, for everything.
[207:36.07]It's okay.
[207:43.75]I'll give you permission to leave the castle, but I expect the utmost caution from you.
[207:48.57]Keep my daughter safe.
[207:51.41]You have my word, Your Grace.
[207:54.74]It seems it's my turn to step forward.
[207:59.66]Oh.
[208:05.36]Can't be letting you have all the fun.
[208:07.72]Let me make some armor from that rainbow shell.
[208:10.82]Finally, time for me to do something again.
[208:12.72]Watch and learn.
[208:19.08]I owe you an apology.
[208:20.02]I'm terribly ashamed of myself.
[208:22.08]Take good care of Nadia, won't you?
[208:34.81]Uh, can't you open this?
[208:40.77]I guess I can't yet.
[208:50.76]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[208:55.10]Where is the... Where's the courtroom?
[209:13.16]Megalixir... Now the first thing we need to do is start all over with discipline.
[209:50.25]Ooh!
[209:58.25]No!
[209:58.65]I screwed it up.
[210:15.21]It's fine.
[210:15.62]It's the present.
[210:16.18]Isn't that bad though?
[210:28.19]White plate, this is crazy.
[210:32.41]Absorbs 50% fire damage?
[210:35.69]Guys, that's insane.
[211:04.79]Hey, can I get a waffle?
[211:06.75]You have permission to... You don't have permission to get a waffle.
[211:13.79]Not for a little bit longer.
[211:33.37]I'm Pierre, the lawyer.
[211:34.77]So where's the real Chancellor?
[211:38.75]How do we get to the courtroom?
[211:54.75]That's fucked up?
[211:55.43]No!
[211:56.25]No, you can't have one.
[212:01.03]How do you... What I said do you not understand?
[212:17.56]Where's the courtroom?
[212:20.18]You can't have one until I know what the courtroom is.
[212:37.95]Up.
[212:43.63]I don't know.
[212:46.80]Where you going?
[212:47.38]I'm trying to find the courtroom so I can get the key.
[212:50.72]Lower right stairs up my boy.
[212:58.23]OK.
[213:02.93]You can now go get your waffle.
[213:09.17]There you go You can go get it now I would like to hear a thank you though
[213:32.88]Oh, thank goodness!
[213:34.10]That beast locked me up in here!
[213:36.35]I've been trapped ever since!
[213:38.79]Princess Nadia, you're friends, I presume?
[213:41.57]Oh, wait!
[213:42.03]I don't have time for this!
[213:42.91]I must prepare for the Moonlight Parade!
[213:44.59]Alright, we're good.
[213:56.75]So now, Rainbow Shell, we have to go talk to Melchior.
[214:06.62]That's not the right house.
[214:14.20]Has this guy even played this game before?
[214:15.86]Didn't he say it's like his favorite game of all time?
[214:19.39]It's one of them.
[214:24.03]Where the hell is he?
[214:37.28]The basement of the castle?
[214:38.30]Oh, I thought he took it home.
[214:55.71]And now, ladies and gentlemen, I will do a Beavis and Butthead rendition of Guardia Castle.
[215:03.67]That's okay.
[215:04.55]You don't have to.
[215:05.43]200 people left.
[215:06.35]I just saw over here my view count went down by 200.
[215:09.04]That's a lot.
[215:10.10]That's 200 individual people left.
[215:41.72]I laugh, but that's a lot of individual minds that all at the same time were like, I don't fucking like this anymore.
[215:47.69]The properties of this material are quite unique.
[215:52.97]I could craft armor from it that will dampen the effects of magic.
[215:57.65]I could make you one highly effective prismatic dress, or I could make three less effective prismatic helms.
[216:06.94]Which would it be?
[216:08.98]Okay, can Isla wear the dress?
[216:21.55]Yes.
[216:29.36]The prismatic dress.
[216:30.36]Are you certain?
[216:31.24]Only women will be able to equip it.
[216:33.58]Yes.
[216:35.44]Very well.
[216:43.52]My work is complete.
[216:45.56]Prismatic dress.
[216:47.78]Yep.
[216:48.08]Let's see.
[216:56.17]This is 213 defense and magic damage reduced by a third.
[216:59.49]It's like having a permanent barrier.
[217:13.38]And I want that crazy magic defense one.
[217:17.66]Who's got it on?
[217:18.20]Does Magus have it on?
[217:23.90]No, no, she's got it on.
[217:26.30]She is so stacked, it's unbelievable.
[217:29.76]Okay.
[217:31.44]An interesting substance.
[217:32.34]I could make something impressive, only I had another material to combine it with.
[217:36.98]So this is where we have to get the sun stone and combine it with the rainbow shell.
[217:40.84]And you get the rainbow blade.
[217:43.08]It is Crono's best item.
[217:45.66]It's the best weapon in the whole game.
[217:50.60]The rainbow blade is the best weapon in the whole game.
[218:08.02]Alright.
[218:10.12]What else is on the agenda?
[218:17.63]Wouldn't that make the game too easy?
[218:20.77]Um... At this stage... We're kind of just doing stuff.
[218:26.64]I just like to see the pretty colors in the flashing lights.
[218:41.15]Uh, let's do this one.
[218:42.45]This is Robo, right?
[218:49.41]What ages do I have to go for this one?
[218:51.05]Is this the Fiona one?
[218:52.57]Alright, everybody.
[219:05.90]Get your tear ducts ready.
[219:12.27]You're talking to Magus!
[219:12.79]Where does this one start?
[219:13.45]I need to get a...
[219:41.62]I gotta get something.
[219:42.36]Where do I get it?
[219:42.92]Is it a seed?
[219:44.36]It's the sapling.
[219:46.81]Okay.
[219:47.59]Sapling in antiquity.
[219:57.35]The seed in the ocean palace.
[219:58.69]Is it the sapling from the future or is it antiquity?
[220:19.10]The Ocean Palace is Black Omen now.
[220:22.22]It's in the village, isn't it?
[220:40.77]Probably should save it.
[220:54.06]Where is it?
[220:59.87]Oh, there it is.
[221:00.27]Oh my god, plant it with hope.
[221:21.68]Alright, I find a place to let it grow.
[221:23.22]Who knows, maybe someday it'll be the key to reviving this dead world of ours.
[221:33.67]Okay, so now... Wrong button.
[221:43.09]Now we go back to the Middle Ages.
[222:03.66]Here we go.
[222:04.00]Worry not, my love.
[222:09.02]We won't be parted again.
[222:24.21]The monsters in the desert cave fear water.
[222:26.15]They seem vulnerable to it, but the greatest of them water or no.
[222:30.69]I could not hope to slay that beast on my own.
[222:33.76]I think we go in here, right?
[222:39.54]Sunken desert?
[222:41.88]I don't think we need Robo yet.
[222:48.68]Take the dream team in here.
[222:57.80]Lapis.
[222:58.19]I got plenty of water.
[223:09.52]Ice is water, right?
[223:16.71]Oh, absolute destruction.
[223:31.92]They're kind of dead.
[223:32.62]It's the hardest part of the game, be careful.
[224:00.41]I'm good, don't worry.
[224:05.44]Oh, she blinks now because she has the barrier.
[224:07.36]Honestly, I think we're so powerful right now.
[224:22.79]I don't think we need to do shit.
[224:25.59]We can get through this by just attacking.
[224:27.17]Don't waste items.
[224:41.94]Nice crit.
[224:43.20]That's it.
[224:44.34]342.
[224:55.17]Ouch.
[225:01.30]We don't give a shit.
[225:02.44]We don't give a shit.
[225:05.96]Nah, that doesn't work that way.
[225:08.67]Pretty decent attempt at a remix, but that's going to go back in the oven.
[225:21.98]I will use magic for this, though.
[225:35.48]Water hardens sand.
[225:36.60]Defense reduced.
[225:50.75]We don't give a crap.
[225:51.95]We don't give a crap.
[225:53.17]We don't give a crap.
[225:54.55]That sounds like when a school play has a song that they desperately try to sound cool to the kids.
[226:05.04]So they make it a song that's like really kind of like kid edgy.
[226:23.19]I got to do ice.
[226:28.40]A lot of encounters in this one.
[226:47.89]What South Park character do you think you're the most like?
[226:50.45]Uh, Tweek.
[226:51.75]I think that's... I don't think I need to answer any more questions.
[227:05.68]Aeonian suit.
[227:16.23]I think he's just best in slot, honestly.
[227:17.75]This is all better.
[227:29.95]Would you consider singing a Rock Lobster cover?
[227:34.50]Nah, we already lost like 500- we lost like 5,000 people over the last few hours of me doing that.
[227:40.00]I don't think so.
[227:50.00]That's a level 20 hype train.
[227:53.18]Which you haven't unlocked, by the way.
[228:18.07]Hey, did you say there was a sponsored stream today?
[228:19.93]Oh shit.
[228:21.25]What time is it?
[228:23.69]Oh shit.
[228:24.93]What time is it?
[228:28.31]That would be bad.
[228:28.93]I don't want to use anything.
[228:40.46]Ground shake.
[228:43.68]Oh, this is bad.
[228:44.61]Actually, because everyone's no... I need heals.
[228:49.90]So that fell beast is what changed soil to sand.
[228:52.68]Bone, move under sand.
[228:56.90]Hard sea.
[228:57.48]Uh, let me use... I bought a shitload of items back like 10,000 years ago.
[229:21.41]What's going on here?
[229:34.36]Five thousand gold?
[229:45.35]I love that animation.
[229:49.29]Alright, let's do... Where is it?
[229:52.01]Drop down.
[229:53.41]Right in the middle.
[229:59.72]Damn.
[230:01.76]It's dead already!
[230:06.08]It's dead!
[230:22.33]but do the top.
[230:28.15]Destroy the top too.
[230:32.43]Magus is going to drop the defense and they'll just kill it.
[230:35.07]They're going to do 15,000 damage in three turns, five turns.
[230:46.34]Maybe it should heal.
[230:50.19]Mmm, now they're okay.
[230:51.72]They take such a little damage, it's crazy.
[231:01.32]Oops.
[231:05.72]It's okay.
[231:15.74]Isla is so good.
[231:19.66]Actually, I need to heal.
[231:21.73]Let's not go too crazy here.
[231:22.91]Can I charm?
[231:23.45]5, 10, 15.
[231:41.34]Get out of here.
[232:01.20]That's nearly a full heal.
[232:02.42]Alright, we're going to take out the top now.
[232:16.97]Drop down on the top.
[232:18.95]This should kill it.
[232:26.79]Cool.
[232:33.42]Oh shit, Isla needs some MP.
[232:48.22]She's just a pair of legs walking around, yeah.
[232:52.32]I am coming up on a break.
[232:54.00]I can definitely kill this in the two minutes I have.
[232:56.36]Watch this.
[233:04.55]There it is.
[233:12.27]Bad bone smash.
[233:13.21]Fiona happy.
[233:19.55]Don't leave anything.
[233:23.03]I'm gonna need these in the end of the game for sure.
[233:29.86]Muscle ring.
[233:31.00]That's going right on Isla.
[233:38.31]Memory cap, cool.
[233:39.09]I think that's good.
[233:43.63]Let me check the muscle ring and then I'm going to go BRB.
[233:53.90]Stamina plus six.
[233:54.84]So even more defense.
[233:58.60]No, I'll keep the barrier ring on.
[233:59.92]No, I don't know.
[234:00.80]I'll figure it out when I get back.
[234:04.58]This possibly could be the last BRB.
[234:09.17]It's very possible.
[234:14.45]I only have a couple more side missions, maybe.
[234:21.86]We'll find out.
[234:23.53]Still got to kill Lavos.
[234:26.33]See you in a few minutes.
[238:41.61]Hello.
[238:44.85]So I did lie to you.
[238:46.31]I told you.
[238:51.57]That was probably the last BRB.
[238:53.87]That was not accurate.
[238:58.19]I've probably got a solid like hour and a half left.
[239:01.61]Maybe like hour and 45 minutes.
[239:04.69]We'll just see.
[239:05.31]I'm not going to rush it.
[239:06.03]I'm just going to go.
[239:07.27]Still enjoying it.
[239:07.89]So let's just play.
[239:08.41]Alright.
[239:10.47]Talk to Fiona.
[239:15.87]Yep.
[239:16.93]You know who's getting that.
[239:23.87]Is it 83 strength?
[239:30.53]After today, here's the thing for those of you that are trying, it's getting late for some people.
[239:35.04]This is going to be the last stream for a few days.
[239:36.66]Probably be live next on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[239:41.04]Probably more likely on Wednesday.
[239:42.68]Okay.
[239:48.06]Alright, here we go.
[239:48.48]I know somebody... that could probably do that.
[240:19.28]There he goes.
[240:21.71]He's gonna do this for 400 years.
[240:53.24]Look at how much, look at how good of a job he's doing.
[241:07.21]Okay.
[241:10.21]Thank you, Robo.
[241:13.01]We'll be back.
[241:14.83]Take care.
[241:15.25]It's so tragic.
[241:21.30]They're like waving at him out the window and it's 400 years ago.
[241:24.56]What an eternity.
[241:29.48]Here we go.
[241:35.73]And look!
[241:39.17]Look at how beautiful it is.
[241:40.05]400 years in the future.
[241:51.98]He did it.
[241:52.44]It worked.
[241:52.84]We're gonna put Luca in the party because I feel like that's appropriate.
[242:11.91]Fiona's Shrine.
[242:20.42]Oh man, you got a lot of shit.
[242:51.74]Oh, 50 grand, but I think this is the best helmet in the game.
[243:14.06]I'm going to buy two of them.
[243:20.69]Somebody said, don't do it.
[243:39.83]I got money.
[243:40.31]I got money.
[243:40.81]Check it out.
[243:48.18]Look at how decked out she is.
[243:49.84]She's unstoppable now.
[243:59.63]Shadow damage in half, though?
[244:00.97]That's pretty great.
[244:01.71]What does Magus have on?
[244:03.51]Okay, he's already got that.
[244:16.99]Well, I got one to put on the shelf.
[244:27.89]There he is.
[244:37.53]He's so beat up.
[244:54.41]systems reactivated where am I oh frog how nice to finally see you again only a few moments have passed for you but I've been waiting for 400 years
[245:13.34]However, my efforts were worthwhile.
[245:16.00]The forest is restored.
[245:18.82]Now shall we celebrate our 400 year reunion?
[245:30.09]I realized something during these past 400 years.
[245:34.17]I believe we may have been incorrect in our assumption that Lavos was responsible for the creation of the gates.
[245:42.95]What do you mean?
[245:45.23]It is not a certainty, but I have come to believe it possible that some entity wished for us to witness these events.
[245:53.35]Perhaps it wanted us to see all these various ages.
[245:58.92]Alternately, it may have wished to see them for itself.
[246:05.74]It seems almost as though it was reflecting on the days of its past.
[246:12.32]Island, no.
[246:13.28]Person, die.
[246:14.18]Seed life pass by, elders say.
[246:18.80]Before death claims a man, he is made to bear witness a second time to those memories engraved most deeply upon his heart.
[246:27.43]There may be fond memories among them, yes, but often as not, the ones which grieve us are the most profound.
[246:35.87]Knowing the end is approaching likely reactivates dormant feelings of regret and desire to return to moments in the past.
[246:44.71]Do you suppose that will happen when our time comes?
[246:48.33]Probably.
[246:49.27]Who knows?
[246:49.73]Is there a point in time you'd want to return to, Luca?
[246:53.59]I... no, not really.
[246:58.46]I'm sorry, I probably shouldn't have asked.
[247:03.59]Who do you think it is?
[247:32.37]It is unknown to me whose memories these are.
[247:35.34]It is likely an entity greater than any of us.
[247:38.72]Perhaps we will not know until our journey has come to an end.
[247:43.22]Shall we turn in for the night?
[247:54.47]When I was younger, this scene used to scare the shit out of me.
[248:16.58]Reminds me of Earthbound.
[248:35.59]What is this?
[248:39.75]June 24, 990.
[248:41.95]Dad promised to go hiking with me, but he blew me off again because of his research.
[248:47.95]I don't get it, but whatever, who cares about stupid science anyway?
[248:51.11]Girls don't need to know about that stuff.
[249:09.42]Password to shutdown device is the name of my one true love.
[249:13.46]Use it in an emergency.
[249:16.86]Cabin.
[249:20.35]One true love.
[249:42.80]What is this thing?
[249:44.74]Anyway, Tabin said to keep away from it, but it's so dusty.
[249:47.30]Surely it wouldn't hurt just to tidy up a little.
[249:58.94]Dear me, my skirt, it's, I'm stuck.
[250:00.54]Luca, Luca, help.
[250:04.93]I can't pull it out.
[250:05.67]Oh, no, Luca, enter the password.
[250:10.27]Stop the machine.
[250:12.17]But I don't know it.
[250:17.47]Enter the password.
[250:30.06]Mommy, thank goodness.
[250:32.94]You can actually have that keep going.
[250:36.60]And it's really awful.
[250:37.84]It's really like terrifying.
[250:38.78]Yeah, I failed this as a kid.
[250:44.53]And it's like kind of terrible.
[250:46.71]It's really terrible.
[250:51.77]Luca.
[250:52.17]Oh, Luca.
[250:52.35]Luca.
[251:06.56]July 2nd, 1990.
[251:09.22]That was close.
[251:09.82]I think I better study a little more about machines in case anything like that ever happens again.
[251:18.07]Does it go faster if you fail?
[251:21.25]It actually might.
[251:23.15]I think even on the original version, you actually had to do L-A, you had to actually press the buttons.
[251:30.45]It wasn't like, oh, spell it out on the screen.
[251:32.71]You had to press the bumpers.
[251:35.94]L-A-R-A.
[251:38.66]And when you're a kid, when I was younger, I just, I don't know.
[251:41.84]I didn't know who his one true love was.
[251:43.76]I was like, what does that mean?
[251:44.92]I guess it's you?
[251:45.92]Who?
[251:46.20]Me?
[251:46.38]Yeah.
[251:51.42]Yeah.
[251:54.08]get out of here.
[252:03.65]I was so confused as a kid.
[252:04.99]L-A-R-A buttons.
[252:06.57]Yeah.
[252:15.07]That was always weighing on your mind, was it not, Luca?
[252:18.48]You're always thinking of others.
[252:23.89]I have a present for you.
[252:26.00]It is a piece of Amber I created using sap from the trees in this forest.
[252:30.72]It required 400 years and a great deal of pressurization to make... I hope you will find it useful.
[252:36.74]The Green Dream.
[252:41.26]Robo, you're so sweet.
[252:42.32]Thank you.
[252:42.70]The Green Dream.
[252:53.42]Automatically revives KO'd wearer once.
[252:58.12]So it brings you back to life.
[253:16.68]I think it is not destroyed.
[253:18.40]I think it is each battle.
[253:25.00]It can activate one time.
[253:27.38]Pretty useful when you've seen the guy a couple times, but... That arc is now finished.
[253:35.34]And we said, why is Crono here?
[253:36.78]Ah, this is... Dude, this is Crono's twin brother.
[253:41.30]Crono.
[253:43.53]Look, there's the sap.
[253:47.89]Crono.
[253:49.67]Crono.
[253:53.86]Kranos.
[253:55.32]Alright, what's left?
[253:58.12]We got one or two more things left to do?
[254:14.37]Sun temple, right?
[254:21.98]Oh, go visit tabin.
[254:22.86]Yeah, right.
[254:43.33]Oh, perfect timing!
[254:45.61]We got Tabin's suit.
[254:48.21]Another great invention just completed.
[254:49.98]The ultimate in defense for my beautiful daughter.
[254:52.28]Oh, perfect timing!
[254:56.92]Tabin's helm.
[254:58.82]Another great invention just completed.
[255:00.30]The ultimate in defense for my beautiful daughter.
[255:02.07]Oh, perfect timing!
[255:06.03]Tabin's vest.
[255:07.91]Another great invention just completed.
[255:09.57]The ultimate in defense for my beautiful daughter.
[255:13.61]Damn!
[255:13.77]Speed halves fire damage, holy shit!
[255:49.79]Got so much stuff.
[255:57.37]Who's the vest for?
[256:01.04]Wait, it's right here.
[256:05.40]Tabin's suit versus Tabin's vest.
[256:06.74]I think it's just an upgraded version.
[256:08.42]Yeah, it's just a better version.
[256:25.43]What's in Luca's room?
[256:30.87]Nothing.
[256:33.71]For saving the mom, you get upgraded version.
[256:35.81]That's right.
[256:38.13]What a beautiful day.
[256:38.80]I think I'll go for a walk once I finish this housework.
[256:52.96]Hooray.
[256:56.03]A timeline.
[257:09.97]Cracker Jacks, not Apple Jacks.
[257:26.43]Yeah, I run this town.
[257:27.57]I'm so rich, I don't know what to do with it.
[257:32.10]No.
[257:40.68]Snail shop?
[257:41.34]Alright, Sun Temple it is.
[257:46.87]Uh, or wait, do I have everything?
[257:48.95]Am I good?
[257:49.51]I want to go to prehistoric time.
[257:56.30]Let me go, hold on, let me do this.
[258:10.63]Waffle Crisp was the shit.
[258:12.39]It was really good, you're right.
[258:18.95]You wish to fight Lavos, correct?
[258:20.57]Okay.
[258:22.27]There's the Black Omen.
[258:23.13]That's what I'm gonna do.
[258:27.76]Okay, what about other little things?
[258:29.52]A task to be done in the future in a birthplace of machines.
[258:33.13]A prehistoric stone that will shine with the light of the ages.
[258:35.83]There we go.
[258:39.49]So that is to do the... Okay, so that's for Robo's ultimate weapon.
[258:49.51]And the other one is for Chrono's ultimate weapon.
[258:56.92]Oh, okay, we can do this too.
[258:57.82]This is the ultimate fight with him.
[259:00.84]Which we are going to get rid of Isla, unfortunately, for now.
[259:04.07]We're going to have these three.
[259:20.90]We're getting very close to the end of the game.
[259:22.84]It's almost here.
[259:28.68]Hey, Punkhead, where you been?
[259:30.08]What do you want?
[259:32.16]You looking for some practice?
[259:34.30]Alright.
[259:34.85]Sorry, but this is gonna kill you.
[259:44.99]Ooh.
[259:46.27]Ow.
[259:47.17]Ow.
[259:47.89]Oh.
[259:56.14]Ouch.
[259:57.38]Why is he hot now?
[259:59.98]Uh, I'm kind of screwed.
[260:32.32]I need barrier.
[260:34.20]I don't think I can kill him right now.
[260:35.30]Damn.
[260:40.07]Oh my god.
[260:41.35]Restart.
[260:42.09]Restart.
[260:59.51]Okay, let's try that again.
[261:02.40]I'm gonna do 800 damage again.
[261:06.08]Shit!
[261:06.58]Alright, I'm not strong enough to beat him.
[261:31.54]I think he's a little too strong.
[261:38.39]I guess I could... Hold on.
[261:39.61]I'm gonna go for it.
[261:57.51]What does Chrono even have for accessories?
[261:59.03]Damn.
[261:59.97]Uh, no.
[262:00.51]Nope.
[262:01.17]Nope.
[262:03.62]That's gonna be GG.
[262:06.22]It's too much to mitigate.
[262:12.16]What are you wearing?
[262:24.58]Bruno didn't even have gear on.
[262:25.96]Eh, it's alright.
[262:27.98]He kicked my ass, it's fine.
[262:55.12]Let's have Isla lead for a little bit.
[263:09.66]Okay.
[263:18.27]So... Let's go to Prehistoric Times.
[263:21.85]Go get the Sun Stone.
[263:28.59]Isla should not be driving.
[263:46.83]What is that?
[263:48.55]Lost Sanctum?
[263:50.29]What is a Lost Sanctum?
[264:00.95]This is extra DS content?
[264:02.72]This is the extra DS content?
[264:04.94]What the fuck is this?
[264:31.88]Can I not go in here?
[264:37.91]This is the worst part of the game, leave before it's too late.
[264:41.57]Really?
[264:50.06]Yes, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[264:53.78]True, leave, no, no, oh no, what?
[264:57.24]It's grindy and gives nothing relevant Okay
[265:28.08]You might get money out of it.
[265:28.90]It feels very unfinished.
[265:38.59]Kind of is.
[265:47.68]So was this just extra assets that they had laying around?
[266:04.24]This is a lost Izalith... Izalith area.
[266:39.81]Well, that killed everybody.
[266:43.11]They did all the extra content for the re-releases.
[266:48.51]This is the worst of it.
[266:50.45]Huh.
[266:54.47]Well, okay.
[267:05.38]He hates content.
[267:06.78]Uh, I'll leave after this.
[267:07.54]I just want to kind of look around.
[267:11.51]Because we are... the game is almost over, so... It's the Dark Omen, and then the end of the game.
[267:19.23]I don't know if I'm gonna... I don't think I'm gonna go do Robo's ultimate thing.
[267:24.89]Maybe I will.
[267:30.02]But we'll be... oh yeah, I'm beating the game tonight.
[267:42.71]The RoboQuest is really cool, though.
[267:45.87]There's only two left.
[267:46.97]You're right.
[267:49.21]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[267:49.89]We can do this extra stuff, like, on another stream.
[267:53.73]You know, like, on a few months.
[267:58.00]It's not that bad until you've climbed the same mountain for the tenth time.
[268:01.22]Okay.
[268:04.48]I get ya.
[268:10.27]Are you certain we should leave?
[268:11.29]There are still monsters!
[268:14.54]Oh, I'm sure.
[268:15.04]Do it right after the sorcery finale, yeah.
[268:38.16]You should experience it for yourself, Andy, but this area is frustratingly repetitive.
[268:44.38]Okay.
[268:44.92]Yeah, I feel you.
[268:47.38]That was a... Okay, if that was like four of you saying that, that was almost everybody.
[268:52.96]Alright, where's the sunstone?
[269:02.41]Where is it?
[269:02.99]It's in a little cave, right?
[269:06.11]Right here, right?
[269:07.77]Where is it?
[269:08.21]Isn't it kind of an island off to the side?
[269:17.39]Right here?
[269:19.74]Yeah, there it is.
[269:22.62]It's not here!
[269:27.84]You bring it back here.
[269:28.92]It's in the future.
[269:50.67]So we can knock out robos and... this too?
[270:01.40]Oh, that's right, because it's completely depleted.
[270:03.32]That's what it is.
[270:19.92]Where is it?
[270:22.70]Uh... Guys?
[270:24.60]The Genodome.
[270:44.43]We're gonna take out Magus for this.
[270:49.51]And we're gonna make sure that Robo has some cool shit, because this is Robo's stuff.
[271:05.13]Let's go.
[271:07.79]I am familiar with this place.
[271:08.99]Please allow me to take the lead.
[271:18.64]Who enters my sanctum unbidden?
[271:20.78]My, my!
[271:22.24]Welcome home, R66Y.
[271:24.07]Or should I say Prometheus?
[271:25.87]And behind you, fleshlings.
[271:27.09]I've seen creatures of flesh from many a day.
[271:30.09]Let me welcome them.
[271:30.89]Come, come within.
[271:31.73]Let's see just what capabilities they possess.
[271:53.55]Carbon-based lifeforms, how boring.
[271:57.69]I think they can just swing normally, it's fine.
[272:31.29]I'm pretty geared at this point, so nothing should be that big of a deal here.
[272:34.83]So we just crossed the 8 hour mark, that's true.
[273:07.94]We probably have, realistically, probably have one more break.
[273:14.95]And then wherever I am at the end of this next break, we're going to the Omen and we're going to go kill Lavos.
[273:25.37]We should finish this.
[273:26.33]I don't really need the Rainbow Blade.
[273:30.54]I'm not going to use Chrono.
[273:37.75]It's cool.
[273:38.95]It's a cool weapon.
[273:39.65]We'll see.
[273:41.43]Alright, I gotta do some magic here.
[273:59.45]It's his game, bro.
[274:00.81]You can't do that to him.
[274:01.87]We'll see.
[274:31.14]leave this on for a few hours after to have the longest stream.
[274:34.64]I'm not going for longest stream, I'm just going until I'm done.
[274:49.27]Oh shit, actually I wasn't prepared for this.
[275:04.03]Tornado.
[275:07.44]Hmm!
[275:11.96]Forgot about Turmoil.
[275:34.99]That game was genuinely really fun.
[275:36.53]I liked it a lot.
[275:38.05]It was fun.
[275:41.49]There we go.
[275:43.91]Here we go, this way.
[276:04.49]Take the waste chute back to the entrance.
[276:06.23]Nope.
[276:08.35]Can I go?
[276:08.99]Yeah!
[276:09.29]How is this not wind magic?
[276:13.51]I don't get it.
[276:51.61]Lapis.
[276:53.47]An elixir.
[276:59.72]Speaking of lapis.
[277:01.42]Let's go ahead and use it.
[277:24.43]What does that do?
[277:25.81]What?
[277:26.10]Where am I?
[277:26.72]What just happened?
[277:28.80]What the hell was that?
[277:55.36]I actually don't know what that was.
[277:56.98]It was a hint?
[277:58.71]Invented.
[277:58.95]Grow.
[277:59.19]Can't believe it.
[278:34.99]Wait.
[278:37.81]Hell yeah.
[278:44.62]We might get her to 99 strength before she's supposed to.
[279:06.98]Also, there's also the theory that I don't need to do everything and get to the end right now.
[279:13.68]The theory is that maybe that this could be another like hour or two stream at the end of another stream.
[279:18.91]I don't need to rush all the way to the end.
[279:28.30]It's just a theory.
[279:36.15]Yeah, you know what?
[279:37.69]You know what?
[279:40.54]Yeah.
[279:42.54]There's probably another hour and a half left.
[279:47.90]Yeah.
[279:48.28]There's an hour and a half probably left in the game.
[279:55.70]I think it's getting kind of late.
[279:59.13]And I really should probably get up and move around a little bit more.
[280:08.20]End of the stream voice.
[280:08.98]Yeah, it's probably good.
[280:10.80]Probably good.
[280:14.82]This is one of my favorite games of all time.
[280:16.12]I don't think I want to... Especially the last 45 minutes of this.
[280:21.87]Nah, let's go fresh.
[280:24.81]There'll be one more Chrono Trigger stream.
[280:32.73]Yeah.
[280:34.91]Kind of a long one today.
[280:37.06]But it was fun.
[280:40.49]Maybe I will check out that game, Haste, a little more.
[280:42.14]Because I feel like playing it for 30 minutes and trying to kind of trial by fire, learn how to play it.
[280:50.14]I actually really liked it.
[280:56.22]Also, the Marvel Rivals thing was cool, too.
[280:59.86]I might actually be playing it now.
[281:06.87]Yeah, I will see you guys on probably Wednesday.
[281:11.80]Wednesday afternoon.
[281:15.80]It was a good weekend.
[281:16.38]I had a great time.
[281:17.86]Yesterday was a lot of fun.
[281:19.40]Obviously, I had a blast yesterday.
[281:22.00]POE with Ster was fun.
[281:25.41]And did some sponsor stuff.
[281:27.27]Had a good time.
[281:27.67]It was a good weekend.
[281:33.75]See you guys on Wednesday.
[281:37.96]I just saved it right here too, so we'll pick up right here where we left off.
[281:46.45]Thanks for sticking around.
[281:47.29]Have a great rest of your night.
[281:51.69]It's midnight eastern time.
[282:08.27]See you soon.
[282:11.15]Yeah, because I'm looking over here, we got another break coming up in like 10 minutes.
[282:18.29]I don't really need to take another three minute break right now.
[282:23.33]Come back and play for like another 30 minutes.
[282:25.09]No, we'll just go fresh.
[282:32.74]Good night.
[282:34.14]Goodbye.
[282:35.80]See you Wednesday.
[282:38.64]See you later.
[283:31.29]you
