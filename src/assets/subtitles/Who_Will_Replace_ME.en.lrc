[00:30.13]Bye.
[00:59.07]Thank you.
[10:55.89]Get that settled there.
[10:57.23]I don't know how many we have here.
[11:04.59]Just one sec, hold on.
[11:06.67]Working on something real quick.
[11:10.57]Hello, how are you?
[11:11.43]Good to see everybody again.
[11:14.41]Just gotta make sure I get this settled to go here.
[11:18.44]Hi.
[11:19.65]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[11:21.51]I'm sure a lot of you are probably pretty curious as to the title of the stream.
[11:25.81]And I've been gone for a few days, so let me sit down here.
[11:29.65]Am I in frame?
[11:30.94]Can you see me at all?
[11:31.86]Can I sit down here?
[11:34.24]So people are probably wondering what this stream is about.
[11:37.02]I've been hyping it up for a couple of months now.
[11:39.20]And of course, how do you describe your retirement?
[11:46.39]How do you describe that?
[11:48.20]Because I've been doing this for about 10 to 12 years now.
[11:51.16]And as I've gone over the last 10 years, I've never really had to think about this.
[11:57.04]And what I wanna do, even if I decide that I'm done, right?
[12:02.24]Like I'm done with Twitch, I'm done with streaming, I'm done with YouTube, whatever it is.
[12:08.42]I ain't going anywhere because the brand needs to live on permanently.
[12:14.90]And I tried to figure out what that meant, how do I do that, how do I let my legacy continue?
[12:22.80]And, oh, do you stream for like another five to ten years?
[12:25.35]I don't fucking think so.
[12:27.25]I don't think so, guys.
[12:29.11]So what I've decided to do is, over the last few months we've scoured the country trying to find who I think
[12:38.55]could potentially be able to replace me.
[12:41.85]And this brand and this dream, because I'm going, look, I'm going anywhere, okay?
[12:47.16]I might be stopping at some point in the future here, but I ain't going anywhere.
[12:51.58]This brand is not going anywhere.
[12:54.20]I'm sticking around forever.
[12:56.05]And I'm going to make sure of it today.
[12:58.72]So without further ado, what we have done is we've scoured the country, various classified ads in newspapers, various boards of who would want to take the reign of Germany, because it's a very, very important reign, incredibly important reign.
[13:14.57]I've been here for 12 years.
[13:17.21]It's got to go on.
[13:18.77]And I need a 20% royalty, permanently.
[13:22.81]So we have scoured the country.
[13:24.97]We have a group of people that I'm willing to at least
[13:28.69]assess if they can handle it or not.
[13:30.97]So what we're going to do is we're going to have to go ahead and go and send in number one, please.
[13:36.10]For who could be my replacement?
[13:38.10]Number one?
[13:38.56]How you doing, number one?
[13:41.76]Very well.
[13:44.80]You've chosen Dark Souls, I think, as your game.
[13:46.48]Go ahead.
[13:46.91]Yes.
[13:50.93]Alright.
[13:51.65]Looks like we are playing some Dark Souls 3 here.
[13:55.65]That's right.
[13:56.94]Okay, jumping around.
[13:58.38]I think maybe I'm just going to roll the whole time.
[14:00.96]Oh, there's a guy right there.
[14:02.14]Alright, I'm going to try to roll past.
[14:04.16]Okay, yep, I'm just going to roll here.
[14:07.24]Yep, I'm just going to keep rolling.
[14:08.62]Oh, there's another guy.
[14:09.63]Okay, oh, I'm just going to roll.
[14:11.53]I'm just going to roll past here.
[14:13.33]Wait, what was this thing?
[14:14.15]What did that say right there?
[14:15.57]Oh, okay, now I'm just going to keep rolling.
[14:17.91]I'm going to roll.
[14:18.49]I'm just going to roll.
[14:20.21]Yep.
[14:22.01]What's he going to do?
[14:24.57]Oh, okay.
[14:31.64]So I'm going to go around the curve here.
[14:35.00]What is up here?
[14:38.05]I think, aren't there supposed to be fights in this game?
[14:40.73]I thought this game was hard.
[14:41.85]Sit at the bonfire.
[14:43.67]Sit at the bonfire.
[14:44.55]Here.
[14:44.75]Do you know what that does?
[14:46.83]Yeah.
[14:47.39]I'm going to light the bonfire, get some nice save point here.
[14:52.13]What's a bonfire do?
[14:53.52]It rests.
[14:54.06]I'm going to rest here.
[14:55.14]What else is there?
[14:56.99]It rests.
[15:00.43]And it's a checkpoint.
[15:05.13]Alright.
[15:05.51]I'm going to try to kill this guy because he doesn't need to be alive anymore here, I think.
[15:14.40]Alright.
[15:14.92]Let's keep on going.
[15:19.24]There's a bomb.
[15:20.10]Oh, my god, get out of the way.
[15:22.06]No, you guys, I'm going to serve.
[15:25.18]No.
[15:26.14]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[15:27.98]OK, OK, no, everything's fine.
[15:29.68]Everything's fine.
[15:30.28]We're OK, we're OK, we're OK, we're OK.
[15:31.46]That's hilarious so far.
[15:32.85]OK, we're OK, we're OK.
[15:34.97]Alright, what is this guy?
[15:36.21]He doesn't look, this guy doesn't look very scary.
[15:38.69]No, I think I got this guy.
[15:40.17]He's like on a knee.
[15:41.19]Like, what's the big deal about that?
[15:42.73]Hey, hey, what are you doing over here?
[15:45.79]You just chilling?
[15:47.31]It's a nice weapon.
[15:49.41]Oh, what was that?
[15:50.69]You can't shoot me from over there.
[15:53.17]That's not fair.
[15:54.15]What do you think you're doing here?
[15:55.45]Maybe I'm going to back step.
[15:57.93]Oh, nothing.
[15:58.49]You are nothing?
[15:59.97]Oh, here we go.
[16:01.35]Remove sword.
[16:01.99]Alright, so I'm going to remove the sword.
[16:03.57]What's the worst that could happen?
[16:06.91]Have you played Dark Souls before?
[16:09.47]Great.
[16:09.59]I have played a little Dark Souls.
[16:11.52]This is what it's... Okay.
[16:12.98]Alright, he's moving now.
[16:14.28]That's alright, that's alright.
[16:15.60]I just... I'm gonna go back to my strategy of rolling here, I think, maybe, and that's... By the way, can you beat the boss?
[16:24.37]Well, I mean, it's... I hear people just roll, right?
[16:27.89]You just roll and then you... You roll.
[16:30.83]Look, I'm doing alright, you know?
[16:33.09]I think... Oops, keep...
[16:35.17]It's alright.
[16:35.85]I'm alive.
[16:36.27]I'm alive.
[16:36.67]I'm alive.
[16:37.01]It's okay.
[16:37.51]It's okay.
[16:38.07]It's alright.
[16:38.98]It's alright.
[16:39.50]Okay.
[16:40.46]I'm gonna take a Estus Flask here.
[16:44.46]There.
[16:44.70]We're alright.
[16:45.18]I think I can take at least two more hits, right?
[16:47.30]We're alright.
[16:48.60]We're alright.
[16:49.16]Yeah.
[16:49.38]It's okay.
[16:49.79]Oh!
[16:50.15]It's alright.
[16:50.61]It's alright.
[16:51.15]I got this.
[16:51.73]I got this!
[16:53.51]He's alright.
[16:58.36]He was supposed to roll.
[16:59.28]He didn't roll.
[16:59.86]Yeah.
[17:00.56]Yeah.
[17:03.20]Yeah.
[17:03.68]I don't.
[17:04.06]I don't.
[17:04.62]I. Thank you so much.
[17:05.76]So.
[17:06.58]Go ahead.
[17:08.04]Yes.
[17:09.00]Alright.
[17:09.38]Thank you.
[17:10.26]In touch.
[17:10.88]Thank you so much.
[17:11.60]Thank you very much.
[17:12.25]Thank you.
[17:13.31]Can we send a number two, please?
[17:16.85]Hey, how you doing?
[17:17.87]I'm doing well.
[17:19.24]Take a seat.
[17:19.80]Yeah, sit down.
[17:21.04]Get comfortable.
[17:21.94]We need to get comfortable.
[17:22.82]Alright.
[17:23.42]What are we going to be playing today?
[17:25.07]A little bit of Tetris.
[17:26.69]Oh, Tetris.
[17:27.21]OK, let's get down to Tetris.
[17:29.11]Alright.
[17:29.69]Should be a little.
[17:30.53]Get in here.
[17:30.89]So I'll tab it there.
[17:32.41]Perfect.
[17:33.59]Right there should do it for you.
[17:35.15]Alright.
[17:35.85]Play button.
[17:36.39]I think it's the arrow keys, by the way.
[17:38.02]Alright, good, good, good.
[17:38.98]Number two, go ahead and get started whenever you're comfortable.
[17:40.90]You got it.
[17:42.68]Alright, starting with a little squiggly shape.
[17:45.88]A little bit of the squiggle.
[17:49.24]Alright, I'd like to see the squiggle.
[17:50.46]Ooh, we got a little upside down T. It can fit right there.
[17:53.80]Alright.
[17:54.34]A little bit of shpee.
[17:55.82]A little bit of shpee there.
[17:57.22]What'd you say?
[17:57.74]A little bit of shpee.
[17:58.42]Is it shpee?
[17:59.06]A little bit of shpee there.
[18:00.24]Shpee.
[18:00.60]Oh, you said shpee.
[18:01.36]Hold on.
[18:01.74]A little bit of shpee.
[18:03.74]Alright.
[18:06.70]And a little bit of shpee.
[18:08.60]Alright.
[18:10.02]Great.
[18:12.04]And another one here.
[18:14.82]Alright, then we got a little... Might be a little too much speed.
[18:18.01]Oh, a little bit too much speed.
[18:19.09]I'll pull back on the speed.
[18:20.43]Pull back on the speed.
[18:21.49]Alright, you got it.
[18:22.55]Alright, you got it.
[18:25.63]Alright, a little square.
[18:26.67]I like to see a square.
[18:27.77]Alright.
[18:29.74]I'm killing this.
[18:33.22]I would watch the middle there, though.
[18:34.40]You've got to be careful.
[18:35.20]I know, I know.
[18:36.06]Get built up and then you don't know what you're going to do.
[18:39.88]Alright.
[18:40.42]Good line clear.
[18:41.48]Good line clear.
[18:42.62]Thank you very much.
[18:43.26]I appreciate that.
[18:44.46]It was only one, but you know, sometimes that's all it takes.
[18:47.09]Sometimes it's all it takes.
[18:48.25]Another line clear there.
[18:49.29]Alright.
[18:51.11]So how long have you been a gamer for, number two?
[18:53.11]I've played since 1998 when I got my Nintendo 64.
[18:56.35]What was your favorite game ever made?
[18:57.54]Favorite game ever made?
[18:58.88]Probably Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
[19:10.92]That's a meme answer.
[19:12.10]Oh, that's a meme answer.
[19:13.42]Give me number two.
[19:14.20]Give me number two.
[19:15.08]Number two.
[19:16.76]Oh, boy.
[19:17.10]Trying to think of my number two favorite game.
[19:19.72]Second favorite game of all time.
[19:21.07]And by the way, you're on the clock here.
[19:22.43]Oh, okay.
[19:23.43]On the clock.
[19:24.03]Of course.
[19:24.37]Of course.
[19:24.59]That's a meme answer and you know it.
[19:25.89]Alright.
[19:27.71]I would probably say this is going to be a little controversial.
[19:31.13]I like Journey.
[19:32.45]Underrated by that game company.
[19:34.20]Wait a minute.
[19:36.14]That's a game where you played with another person and you didn't know who they were from across the world, right?
[19:40.00]Yes, exactly, yeah.
[19:41.62]You can work well with others.
[19:43.56]Yes.
[19:44.70]Oh, I love collab games for sure.
[19:48.12]Are you open to collaborations with other YouTubers and streamers and stuff like that?
[19:51.58]Do you think you're comfortable in those spaces?
[19:52.99]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[19:53.87]I feel like I can get along with just about anybody, really.
[20:01.71]If you clear this whole row, then I'm going to be very, very excited.
[20:05.28]Alright.
[20:06.44]Got two.
[20:07.18]We got two.
[20:08.12]We got two.
[20:09.60]Not quite enough.
[20:10.42]I got to put that one.
[20:11.68]Okay.
[20:12.12]You missed.
[20:12.76]Okay.
[20:13.24]You didn't get that second row.
[20:14.36]I know.
[20:15.01]I know.
[20:15.49]Had a couple of missing blocks there.
[20:16.81]Ooh, that was pretty good, though.
[20:18.03]Okay.
[20:18.21]Yeah.
[20:18.53]On the second there.
[20:19.41]Good at deduction of mathematical equation intricacies.
[20:24.81]Absolutely.
[20:25.35]I think of myself as something of a scientist.
[20:38.45]Very nice.
[20:39.07]Oh, thank you.
[20:39.57]I appreciate that.
[20:41.17]You know, number two, that's all I think I need to see.
[20:42.55]That's all you need to see?
[20:43.21]That's all I need to see.
[20:43.85]It's been an absolute pleasure.
[20:44.91]Absolutely.
[20:45.47]Yeah.
[20:46.07]Alright.
[20:46.99]Phenomenal.
[20:47.55]Phenomenal job.
[20:48.43]Appreciate it.
[20:50.12]Send in number three, please.
[20:53.18]That was very good.
[20:54.96]Number three, how are you?
[20:57.18]I'm great.
[20:57.58]Okay.
[20:58.92]What are you going to play first?
[21:00.43]Oh, you know, like a true gamer?
[21:01.59]I'm going to flip some houses.
[21:06.12]Should just be able to go like this.
[21:10.21]Right here.
[21:11.49]Controller disconnected, unfortunately.
[21:13.01]Let's see if we can get that clicked in.
[21:16.23]Please connect the controller.
[21:17.39]There we go.
[21:18.73]Can you play the continued game?
[21:20.61]Oh, you're going to have to use WSD.
[21:23.54]You're going to have to prove you're a real gamer.
[21:26.24]Oh, man.
[21:26.84]Okay, we've got some mouse action here.
[21:28.44]Here we go.
[21:29.00]What is this garbage?
[21:31.42]Did you put this here?
[21:32.87]Now, House Clippers game where you clean.
[21:34.67]Is that it?
[21:35.19]Is it just cleaning?
[21:37.13]Yeah, I'm not going to say much.
[21:39.29]I have to stay back.
[21:39.85]I have to stay completely and completely out of this.
[21:42.13]Oh, this is disgusting.
[21:45.35]Are there rats in this game?
[21:47.53]I bet there aren't.
[21:48.33]Why do you care about that?
[21:49.69]Fucking hate rats.
[21:51.31]Unless it's a large rat that makes all the rules.
[21:52.93]The fuck did he say?
[21:53.85]Nothing.
[21:54.27]Nothing.
[21:54.91]Nothing, bro.
[21:56.11]What is this?
[21:56.95]Can I take a sledgehammer to something?
[21:58.45]Doesn't like rats.
[21:59.57]That's very important, number three.
[22:01.19]I mean...
[22:03.00]Charlie Day and I, we go way back with rats.
[22:06.22]What do I do with this?
[22:06.96]Do I set it places?
[22:10.91]Yeah, if you go to the, have you played House Flipper before?
[22:13.91]I have never played this before.
[22:15.37]So if you go ahead and head to the laptop over in the corner.
[22:19.57]Ah, there we go, there we go.
[22:21.04]There you go.
[22:22.18]Laptop will give you a job to do.
[22:23.48]You should just do one of the jobs if you can.
[22:25.42]Sweet.
[22:26.28]Go ahead and do one of the jobs, number three.
[22:28.14]Just number three, if you could do one of the jobs, number three.
[22:31.80]Good browser, I think.
[22:32.88]Fuck.
[22:33.98]Damn.
[22:34.34]Yeah, good browser.
[22:35.42]And then you can pick one of these.
[22:36.98]Oh, you can go to... How affordable?
[22:39.24]Yeah, pick one at the top left, one number three, if you could, please.
[22:41.72]Alright.
[22:42.86]Can't afford a number three?
[22:43.88]Okay, go back.
[22:44.92]Oh, we got... Hit the X number three.
[22:47.56]Can't afford any of these.
[22:49.03]Oh, is that the cheapest?
[22:50.39]Wow, it's realistic.
[22:51.79]That's okay.
[22:52.33]That's pretty good.
[22:53.01]Go in the... Maybe the mail?
[22:55.28]Alright.
[22:56.14]Okay, there you go.
[22:56.82]Yes.
[22:57.16]Okay, except that job number three and go ahead and get started.
[22:59.30]Alright.
[22:59.76]Let's see.
[23:00.20]Stole a radiator.
[23:01.43]Knows how to stall really well.
[23:02.55]That's pretty good.
[23:04.51]He's got stalling in his record, but doesn't like rats.
[23:08.25]That's very important.
[23:09.55]Okay.
[23:10.99]Okay.
[23:13.85]I wouldn't do that.
[23:15.15]I wouldn't do that, number three.
[23:16.51]I'm afraid I wouldn't do that.
[23:18.25]Should you be around like that for no reason?
[23:19.79]That's weird.
[23:20.41]Should we just go with some Tetris?
[23:22.37]Well, I don't know.
[23:23.35]His health quiver just disappeared.
[23:24.61]You want to pivot number three.
[23:26.31]That's up to you.
[23:26.83]Go ahead.
[23:27.17]I'm going to let you know, I think it might have closed on itself.
[23:29.39]Oh, it's a crash?
[23:31.49]You're playing Tetris.
[23:34.17]You're playing number two's game number three.
[23:37.69]I play it terribly.
[23:42.58]Number three, can I get you to say, just really quickly, can you say, look at me?
[23:46.56]Look at me?
[23:47.63]A little more emphasis on the look it.
[23:49.65]Look it.
[23:50.33]Look at me.
[23:51.61]Look at me right here.
[23:54.15]Why does it rotate on its own?
[23:55.63]Who crafted this?
[23:56.67]Oh boy, oh boy.
[23:57.61]Hold on.
[24:00.01]Okay, number three.
[24:00.39]I think I've seen enough.
[24:01.05]Thank you so much.
[24:01.71]I appreciate it.
[24:02.37]Very much so, number three.
[24:03.45]Thank you, sir.
[24:03.81]I appreciate it.
[24:05.71]Thank you, number three.
[24:06.23]Senator number four, if you could.
[24:11.22]I like the energy.
[24:11.90]I like the energy on that one, but I don't know.
[24:13.20]Let's see what we've got.
[24:22.01]You want to hug?
[24:23.69]I'll sit down.
[24:24.53]No, sit down.
[24:25.25]I'm going to sit down.
[24:26.47]Number four is weird.
[24:27.09]I'm going to sit down.
[24:27.71]Number four is a weird fucking guy.
[24:30.59]Yeah, I'm a weird guy.
[24:32.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:33.20]What do you want to play number four?
[24:35.70]House flickman.
[24:37.05]Okay, I think House of Flipper may have crashed.
[24:39.28]Number four, so we're going to have to see if we can get House of Flipper.
[24:43.80]If we can get House of Flipper back up.
[24:45.54]It's alright, yeah, play that.
[24:46.70]You know, play whatever.
[24:48.21]I play these games all the time.
[24:49.09]You know, this is my thing, you know?
[24:51.63]Good, very good.
[24:52.37]Yeah, yeah.
[24:53.57]House of Flipper, not House of Flipper, that's your name.
[24:55.87]Number four, what's your favorite game of all time?
[24:58.94]I like Scrabble.
[25:03.36]Right?
[25:04.14]That's okay.
[25:04.62]Yeah.
[25:05.10]Scrabble is his favorite game.
[25:07.14]Yeah.
[25:09.06]Online.
[25:09.52]Online Scrabble.
[25:10.20]Online Scrabble.
[25:10.88]Does he play Wordle?
[25:11.82]Yeah.
[25:12.34]I love Wordle.
[25:13.40]What do you think about the New York Times buying Wordle?
[25:16.86]It's a good buy.
[25:17.70]It's a good move for them.
[25:19.31]Probably, yeah.
[25:20.39]That's a good idea.
[25:21.17]Really, actually, good take on that.
[25:22.74]Yeah, thank you.
[25:23.54]Good take on that.
[25:25.20]Make some money.
[25:26.04]They're probably not doing so well.
[25:27.86]No, I don't know.
[25:28.66]People's subscriptions don't beat.
[25:30.06]Who reads a newspaper anymore anyways?
[25:31.57]Right.
[25:31.97]Actually, really good fucking mind on this one.
[25:33.93]Okay.
[25:34.51]Yeah.
[25:35.03]You know, I'm thinking.
[25:36.53]Yeah.
[25:36.79]Yeah, I'm a big thinker.
[25:38.09]Like you.
[25:39.28]Yeah, of course.
[25:41.00]So when you load in, there's a computer.
[25:43.22]They crashed out, but it's okay.
[25:44.34]We're not going to take this into your audition time.
[25:46.56]That's okay.
[25:46.88]I mean, yeah.
[25:48.14]I'm waiting.
[25:48.40]We're hanging out.
[25:48.78]We're talking, you know?
[25:50.06]It's great.
[25:50.38]Now, this is actually really good to see how you are.
[25:52.46]This is an audience here as well, so make sure you're aware of that, right?
[25:55.76]Oh.
[25:58.73]We don't know you're on camera?
[26:00.11]Oh, yeah.
[26:01.95]I thought this was it.
[26:02.81]Yeah.
[26:03.17]Yeah, I knew that.
[26:04.03]Okay.
[26:04.41]Yeah, I'm ready.
[26:05.29]Are you actually ready for this?
[26:06.17]Yeah, I'm ready.
[26:07.01]We told everybody they were going to be doing it on stream, right?
[26:12.09]You didn't tell people they could be on camera.
[26:15.09]Okay.
[26:15.47]Well, I'm going to have to knock that down for you, actually, Community J, because that's ridiculous.
[26:19.86]Continue game.
[26:20.48]Maybe you can load in.
[26:21.52]Go to the laptop.
[26:22.34]Have you played House Flipper before?
[26:23.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:26.55]I like the demeanor, by the way.
[26:27.75]Yeah, yeah.
[26:28.09]This is great.
[26:28.55]Yeah, yeah.
[26:28.97]No, it's no big deal.
[26:29.75]I mean, I don't...
[26:36.09]Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's great.
[26:37.57]It's great.
[26:38.29]I like the demeanor.
[26:39.17]I think the accent is there.
[26:40.67]Yeah.
[26:41.39]I think it's good.
[26:42.39]Yeah.
[26:42.73]I actually do think it's good.

[28:51.56]You got my money.
[28:52.42]What is this?
[28:52.88]Number five, favorite game of all time.
[28:54.44]Oh, it's definitely going to be, what's the one where you beat the people up with the money and the cars?
[28:59.99]Grand Theft Auto.
[29:00.77]I love that game.
[29:02.07]Which GTA?
[29:02.71]Oh, the one with the Roman numerals.
[29:05.41]Yeah, you're going to go in there.
[29:07.29]Actually, what are you supposed to do here?
[29:08.59]Press A?
[29:09.57]I'm pressing A. Which one?
[29:11.54]I think number five.
[29:12.56]GTA 5.
[29:13.44]Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
[29:14.72]Where you can fly around and do the things where the cops are after you and stuff like that.
[29:18.36]Yeah, if you go to the temple of that edge.
[29:21.08]Oh, don't worry.
[29:21.91]Hi, buddy there.
[29:23.15]What's up?
[29:23.51]Hey, you got my money?
[29:24.03]You got my money?
[29:24.75]You got my money?
[29:27.15]Watch out for that ledge, number five.
[29:28.93]Watch out for that ledge.
[29:30.07]Don't fall off that ledge.
[29:31.35]I don't know if it would be funny or not.
[29:32.97]It would definitely be funny.
[29:34.67]I'm not sure.
[29:38.31]Yes!
[29:39.72]Oh, thank God.
[29:41.06]Oh, thank God.
[29:42.02]I won, right?
[29:43.26]Oh, number five.
[29:44.14]I don't think I need to see anymore.
[29:45.68]Okay.
[29:45.94]Well, it's been great.
[29:48.50]It's been fantastic.
[29:49.20]Number five, thank you so much.
[29:50.87]What a pleasure.
[29:59.17]Number six, how are you?
[30:02.11]Good, sir.
[30:02.61]Good to see you.
[30:03.01]What are you going to be doing first thing?
[30:04.61]Today will be Dark Souls.
[30:06.65]Well, good, because number five just left you out for exactly where you need to be.
[30:12.05]Appear to be some sort of a knight.
[30:13.81]Should be an easy game.
[30:15.14]The controller no longer functions.
[30:17.30]Number two, broken.
[30:17.94]If you use WASD on the keyboard there...
[30:22.96]Oh, old school.
[30:23.86]Easy peasy.
[30:25.00]And the mouse, too, should work.
[30:26.50]Oh, okay.
[30:27.52]Be careful of that ledge.
[30:28.92]You don't want to fall off the ledge.
[30:30.02]Because number five, I'll be honest, number five did the fall joke already.
[30:33.10]Alright.
[30:33.42]Well, this is going to be too easy.
[30:35.02]I'm used to beating games like broken trail.
[30:37.42]Oh, shit.
[30:38.09]No, I'm fine.
[30:38.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[30:41.47]There you go.
[30:41.93]Actually, it can work under pressure.
[30:43.71]I'm going to put that down.
[30:44.49]Number six can work under pressure.
[30:46.97]I'm some sort of a paladin.
[30:49.33]This looks to be one of my black-robed friends.
[30:53.20]I don't know why the controller is vibrating.
[30:58.65]It doesn't work.
[31:00.33]It feels good, actually.
[31:03.51]It's my skin.
[31:06.12]There's some sort of a technical... That was actually a hilarious way to go.
[31:11.16]There was some sort of a technical glitch, I think.
[31:13.04]I don't think my controller is working right.
[31:16.25]Your controller is broken, is that what you're saying?
[31:18.63]Well, I mean, I am a hardcore gamer, so... What's your favorite game of all time?
[31:25.46]Oregon Trail.
[31:26.50]Oh, boy, that's bad.
[31:28.38]Okay.
[31:29.78]What a shit game.
[31:30.78]Oh, boy.
[31:31.28]Oh, this is easy.
[31:34.06]Click, click, click, and slash.
[31:36.19]And hack, and slash, and hack, and slash.
[31:38.23]Number six, you like it when, for instance, people just get diarrhea through the whole game and you lose no matter what?
[31:44.11]Yeah, I'm having some sort of a red diarrhea problem in this game.
[31:47.33]I don't know what that is, but it's leaking out of my chest cavity.
[31:51.87]And I sell a fourth to defeat my former friend.
[31:58.60]No one's going to the boss door.
[32:07.95]Space is dodge.
[32:08.99]Oh, okay.
[32:09.55]Oh, you got a backstab.
[32:10.92]Power punch.
[32:12.08]That was actually pretty good.
[32:13.02]Yeah, he's been working out.
[32:14.90]He's been to the gym a couple times this week.
[32:16.88]Number six.
[32:21.24]Destroy.
[32:21.95]Number six.
[32:22.53]I will consider this if you can get through the boss door.
[32:26.47]A, A, A, A, A, jump.
[32:30.83]I will consider this if you can get it.
[32:36.13]What would A be?
[32:37.73]Meditate.
[32:38.67]A on the mouse and keyboard.
[32:40.43]Who knows?
[32:41.03]Does anybody know in chat?
[32:42.18]Anybody know?
[32:42.70]Can anybody say it?
[32:44.46]Say friend to enter.
[32:46.24]Lord of the Rings.
[32:47.58]No?
[32:47.80]Do you like Lord of the Rings?
[32:50.46]Well, of course.
[32:51.46]Okay.
[32:54.04]Now, when was the last time you shit your pants, number six?
[32:57.42]Just about two minutes ago, actually.
[32:59.52]Perfect.
[33:00.26]Right now, actually.
[33:02.75]E should be to go through the door.
[33:04.00]E. E to enter.
[33:05.34]I think you have to be standing in front of it.
[33:07.68]So number six is shit in your pants right now.
[33:09.10]Is that what you're saying?
[33:10.66]It's a little bit frightening.
[33:11.40]Here, there we go.
[33:12.10]This is easy.
[33:12.78]Number six, if you last more than ten seconds of this boss, I will consider it.
[33:17.81]Okay.
[33:23.85]You're just supposed to click the left button multiple times.
[33:32.40]Well, I will be in touch.
[33:33.70]Thank you so much.
[33:34.30]Number six.
[33:34.76]Mahalo.
[33:35.66]Thank you so much.
[33:36.25]Number six.
[33:36.65]Appreciate it.
[33:37.37]We'll be in touch.
[33:39.79]He did get in the boss story though.
[33:41.81]Nobody else did.
[33:42.49]Nobody else has gotten in the tutorial box zone.
[33:46.01]Set a number seven, please.
[33:46.95]Number seven.
[33:47.40]How are you?
[33:47.86]Hello.
[33:48.08]I'm good.
[33:49.90]What are you going to be doing for us?
[33:51.66]Uh, hoping for, uh, you got destiny too on this.
[33:55.94]I don't have Destiny 2 at all.
[33:58.12]Will you be playing House Flipper?
[33:59.88]We'll do House Flipper.
[34:01.52]I think you're going to probably have to use the keyboard and mouse.
[34:03.26]The controller is malfunctioned.
[34:04.34]Is this a Mad Catz controller?
[34:06.18]No, it's a... I think it's something A. I don't know what it is.
[34:11.13]House Flipper, okay.
[34:11.71]You know how to play House Flipper?
[34:13.33]I've played this game before a good bit.
[34:15.67]What's going on chat today?
[34:16.65]We're going to be doing more House Flipper again.
[34:18.91]You guys have seen this one before a couple times.
[34:20.73]I don't know if I've actually played this mission yet.
[34:25.87]I think you're in the tutorial, like in the house.
[34:28.17]Which, by the way, if you make it into the computer, that would be huge.
[34:30.53]Nobody else has done that.
[34:31.81]Make it to the computer?
[34:33.41]Yeah, like the laptop.
[34:34.97]Like this?
[34:36.23]Yeah, just to do a job or something.
[34:37.99]Oh, okay.
[34:38.77]Yeah, yeah.
[34:39.92]Well, we're in a house right now, it seems.
[34:41.66]Turn around.
[34:45.08]Okay, turn back around.

[34:48.22]Connor.

[35:08.72]Wait, hold on a minute.
[35:09.82]Wait, wait, wait.

[36:05.59]No.
[36:05.97]Did you see his pants?
[36:08.43]No, I don't know why that's his name.
[36:09.77]What was his name?
[36:10.59]That's kind of weird.
[36:11.19]You're number eight.
[36:11.73]How are you?
[36:12.51]That's me.
[36:12.85]I'm good.
[36:13.31]That was weird.
[36:15.22]Why is he here?
[36:15.72]He has like a successful channel.

[46:38.00]Sorry, I didn't want to admit it.
[46:39.34]Very good answer, actually.
[46:41.27]Go ahead and, it's keyboard and mouse, W-A-S-D is to move, left click is to swing your sword, and space is to dodge.
[46:46.43]If you could take out that controller there right now, if you could.
[46:49.95]Just control it down here?
[46:50.93]Well, the controller's broken, but the keyboard and mouse, you do W-A-S-D to move.
[46:56.21]W-A-S-D to move?
[46:57.68]Number two broke the controller, and we're very upset about it.
[46:59.82]Damn it, number two.
[47:01.32]Oh my god, fuck me.

[47:16.46]Okay, I'm going to just go down here, I suppose.
[47:19.26]Yeah.
[47:20.22]Oh, you didn't tell me what the attacks are.
[47:22.25]Left click is attack and space is dodge.
[47:25.29]Did I kill him?
[47:26.27]You did.
[47:26.87]Fuck yeah.
[47:28.35]Okay, I guess I'm going this way.

[49:56.89]Thank you so much.
[49:57.37]I appreciate it.
[49:58.17]Number 12, that was really fantastic.
[49:59.91]Thank you so much.
[50:00.73]Number 13 can come on in, please.
[50:04.09]How do you run with Tetrises?
[50:06.06]Number 13, how are you?
[50:07.40]Good, good.
[50:08.12]Thank you.
[50:08.72]Good to see you.
[50:09.58]Sit down.
[50:09.92]What are you going to do for us?
[50:11.36]Well, I am going to do Tetris.
[50:18.64]button here.
[50:19.04]You can put in whatever initials you want, it doesn't really matter.
[50:22.64]It's just like a random website.
[50:23.86]That's fine.
[50:26.22]I set the restart button right in the middle there.
[50:28.68]So you got the arrow keys it should be to move the Tetris pieces around.
[50:32.70]And you flip them around and down is to make it go down.
[50:35.24]And number 13, I'd like to go right at the back.
[50:38.15]What's your favorite sound?
[50:43.21]How do you flip it again?
[50:44.69]It should be the right and left arrow keys?
[50:46.70]The right and space?
[50:48.42]Oh, okay, that one's garbage, but the next one will be better.
[50:52.54]Alright, let's see if I can hit this down and then slide it across right now.
[50:58.41]Yeah, that's the ticket.
[51:01.01]We're hit to be square here.
[51:04.05]So Tetris is really fun because it was invented in the 1600s in Russia and people would play with nothing but sticks and vodka.
[51:17.58]And here we are all these years later playing it.
[51:25.98]That's history.
[51:27.41]That's history, yeah.
[51:29.25]Vladimir Tetrasnov invented it and they used to play with rocks and sticks and they would try to fit it and apparently they would build whole villages this way and that's why Russia is such a messed up place now.
[51:50.29]There's other reasons too.
[51:51.85]Economics pop, but mostly I blame Tetris.
[51:55.57]So Tetris was invented in, I did not know that.
[51:58.19]That's a war conversation.
[51:59.87]Oh, do you remember the theme song?
[52:01.33]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[52:05.51]You know, you know that's vodka right there.
[52:07.45]Are you going to get a good clear here at number 13?
[52:09.97]A good clear?
[52:10.43]Are you going to get a good clear at board clear?
[52:14.15]Well, I think you're asking a lot for the first time, but I'll try to impress you.
[52:19.65]Oh, it was one line, though.
[52:23.60]Well, we all got to start somewhere.
[52:25.30]All got to start somewhere.
[52:26.58]Boom!
[52:27.10]Oh, you got actually.
[52:29.42]Alright.
[52:29.82]Bingo.
[52:30.52]Bingo, bingo, bingo.
[52:31.96]Very nice number 13.
[52:33.30]I spent a lot of summers playing on my Game Boy.
[52:36.93]I didn't have a lot of friends.
[52:38.83]Now I have two friends, but back then I didn't have any, so I had a lot of time to play.
[52:44.15]That's actually kind of perfect, because I only have like three friends, too.
[52:46.55]You always got to one-up me, huh?
[53:05.10]Can I get you to say, look at me?
[53:07.76]Look at me.
[53:09.12]Again?
[53:09.64]Look at me.
[53:10.12]Number 13, that's all I need to see.
[53:11.98]Thank you so much, number 13.
[53:13.29]Thank you.
[53:15.89]Next time.
[53:17.29]Excellent exit.
[53:19.31]Wait till the door closes so we talk about it.
[53:23.59]Donnie, when you're out, we talk about you after the door closes.
[53:25.75]Oh, I thought you wanted to talk about me now.
[53:27.33]No, no, when the door closes, we talk about you.
[53:29.19]I'm going to have my ear pressed to the door.
[53:38.49]Number 14, please send in number 14.
[53:42.42]Hey, get in here.
[53:44.34]No, you're 14.
[53:45.20]You're 14.
[53:45.36]Come on in.
[53:46.24]How are you, 14?
[53:46.82]Nice to meet you.
[53:47.62]Nice to meet you, 14.
[53:49.29]We have Tetris here for you.
[53:50.67]We might have to restart it, but what were you going to play for us?
[53:53.39]I mean, I love Tetris.
[53:54.33]I was going to do House Flipper.
[53:56.03]Do you know how to play House Flipper?
[53:58.26]Or do you know how to play Tetris?
[53:59.56]Which is better for you?
[54:00.96]Looks like we're going with Tetris.
[54:02.79]Can you salvage this?
[54:04.35]Salvage this game right now?
[54:05.41]If you salvage this game, number 14, that is a monumental deal.
[54:08.99]Well, look at where they left me.
[54:11.13]Just... By the way, number 14, did you know that the Russians played this?
[54:15.39]The Russians played this?
[54:16.31]Apparently.
[54:18.37]Really?
[54:18.81]Yeah, if you can salvage this, that's a huge deal.
[54:20.55]Number 14, what's your favorite ride at Disney World?
[54:23.87]Hmm...
[54:27.83]I'd have to say it's a small world.
[54:29.89]Wrong.
[54:31.01]Correct.
[54:31.37]Try again.
[54:32.03]Okay.
[54:33.42]The Pirates of the Caribbean ride.
[54:34.54]Good.
[54:35.10]Thank you.
[54:36.72]Alright.
[54:39.96]Ah!
[54:40.98]Not bad.
[54:41.66]A salvage.
[54:42.74]Pretty good salvage, actually.
[54:43.82]You can use the keys too if it helps.
[54:57.21]Under pressure as well.
[54:58.31]This is huge under pressure.
[54:59.87]I was thrown into a game.
[55:01.03]I feel like this is what happens to people.
[55:03.67]What's your favorite emote on Twitch?
[55:05.93]My favorite emote?
[55:07.81]I'd have to say... MonkaS.
[55:14.97]Game over.
[55:15.37]Game over.
[55:16.05]Did you lose?
[55:16.61]Try one more.
[55:17.69]I'll give you one more attempt.
[55:22.41]If you were to use MonkaS in a sentence, how would you use it?
[55:25.89]I would say, I got put in the middle of a Tetris game of someone else, and I failed.
[55:32.45]So that makes me want to go, mocha ass.
[55:33.93]Very nice.
[55:35.58]Thank you.
[55:35.80]Very nice number four, Steve.
[55:38.00]Thank you.
[55:40.20]Very nice.
[55:43.02]Could you play that line again for me, please?
[55:45.98]Here we go.
[55:46.82]By the way, I never played Tetris on my screen one time.
[55:50.06]I think the game sucks.
[55:50.88]I think it's a stupid fucking child's game.
[55:52.94]Well, that's why I think I should have done House Flipper.
[55:54.92]Yeah.
[56:00.46]Well, intelligent people play.
[56:01.88]That must have been number 13, Joyce, so.
[56:06.12]Actually, you're doing actually a pretty good build-up, number 14.
[56:09.16]You think so?
[56:11.98]Oh, shit.
[56:14.66]Oh, shoot, number 14.
[56:16.78]Somebody help me.
[56:18.64]Number 14.
[56:19.28]Okay, thank you so much for your time, number 14.
[56:21.50]I'm going to have to cancel you out there.
[56:23.60]I'm sorry.
[56:24.10]Close you out there, number 14.
[56:25.24]Thank you so much for coming.
[56:26.33]Thank you.
[56:34.10]How are you?
[56:34.40]Good to see you, 15.
[56:36.31]Alright, what are we doing?
[56:37.31]What do you want to play for us?
[56:38.27]We've got Dark Souls, House Flipper, and Tetris.
[56:40.69]Let's play some Tetris!
[56:42.57]Alright, you want to go Tetris?
[56:44.03]You've got a game going right now.
[56:45.57]Oh, but who was this person?
[56:47.93]I didn't do this.
[56:49.13]This is not me.
[56:50.15]Under Pressure.
[56:52.05]Oh, that's a great song.
[56:55.45]It is.
[56:55.71]I like these pieces because they're small and compact like me.
[57:00.28]Oh, how do I, oh yeah, okay.
[57:02.82]There we go.
[57:03.64]Oh, and the colors.
[57:05.68]Oh, all the colors.
[57:06.48]Yeah, yeah.
[57:08.36]Okay, there we go.
[57:10.10]See?
[57:11.06]Yeah, look at that.
[57:12.78]See that?
[57:13.70]Oh, I'll clear the line.
[57:17.88]I'll clear it all the way down the line.
[57:19.94]Oh, there we go.
[57:21.96]Oh, we are cooking with gas right now.
[57:26.64]Oh, I am prepared.
[57:28.81]I was up all night just me and some jilt cola, baby.
[57:35.15]Oh, look at this.
[57:35.81]Look at this.
[57:36.21]I'm building a tower of love.
[57:40.20]I'm going to go down there.
[57:42.48]What am I going to do?
[57:45.48]Let's see.
[57:46.22]The pressure's on now.
[57:47.77]Be careful here, number 15, careful.
[57:49.62]I know, I know.
[57:50.84]You're getting close.
[57:52.16]No, but I was creating a sort of a mosaic, you know, a mosaic.
[57:57.31]You can restart it.
[57:58.77]I want to see one more.
[57:59.51]Okay, alright.
[58:00.55]How do I turn these things anyway?
[58:02.53]So you should be using the left and right arrow keys.
[58:08.93]And then that goes in.
[58:10.93]Oh, I see.
[58:12.61]I see.
[58:13.03]Okay.
[58:15.09]I'm going to nestle this guy in here.
[58:16.75]I'm just going to hug him gently.
[58:20.45]You see that?
[58:20.99]You see that?
[58:21.77]That was very nice.
[58:22.61]Yeah.
[58:23.89]Thank you.
[58:25.07]Okay.
[58:25.75]Very impressive.
[58:26.87]Yeah.
[58:27.11]See, the original Game Boy was loaded with this.
[58:30.53]Did you have a Game Boy?
[58:32.15]I did.
[58:33.11]The only game I ever beat was DuckTales.
[58:35.94]Woo-hoo.
[58:36.92]It's a great game.
[58:37.44]It is a great game.
[58:38.16]You've played one now on NES.
[58:40.36]No, I wasn't allowed to have that because my parents don't love me.
[58:46.70]I had to play it over at friends' homes.
[58:49.31]I had to play it over there.
[58:51.81]That's also where I got sugared cereal.
[58:54.73]Nothing but bran flakes and grape nuts at my place.
[58:59.25]Very interesting backstory.
[59:00.73]Yeah.
[59:02.44]There's a little bit of a bio there.
[59:08.19]Wait, hold on, I've got to do this.
[59:11.09]It feels so good.
[59:12.23]Oh wait, I've got to do this.
[59:13.41]Oh, there it goes.
[59:16.82]15, that's all I need to see.
[59:20.80]Absolutely phenomenal job, by the way.
[59:22.34]Brought a change of pants, thank god.
[59:24.20]Did everybody shit their pants before they got here?
[59:26.34]Is that a requirement?
[59:30.77]Number 16.
[59:31.35]You didn't think we had more than ten people?
[59:34.31]16, how are you?
[59:34.83]Hi, good, how are you?
[59:36.04]Good, I'm doing fantastic.
[59:37.06]Nice to meet you.
[59:37.70]Nice to meet you, too.
[59:38.56]I'm very, very happy to meet you.
[59:40.04]We already have Tetris going, but... Oh, okay.
[59:41.82]There's also other options if you'd like to give us something.
[59:44.23]Cool.
[59:44.47]Could I play Dark Souls?
[59:45.89]You absolutely could.
[59:46.59]Yeah, Alt-Tab.
[59:47.61]The controller is broken at some point.
[59:49.27]Oh, unfortunate.
[59:49.77]So you have to keyboard and mouse.
[59:50.97]W-A-S-T, left click, right click.
[59:52.47]R is Estus, and Space is Dodge.
[59:55.29]What's Perry?
[59:56.52]Perry, good fucking question.
[59:58.48]What a number 16.
[59:59.66]You're the first person to ask that question.
[60:02.24]So we're going to go ahead and write that down.
[60:03.84]Okay.
[60:04.40]First of all, number 16, something you need to know is that 16 people, probably 9 people, picked Dark Souls for some reason.
[60:09.12]Okay, that's a lot.
[60:10.10]And none of them have... ...health by about 10%.
[60:13.46]So let's just know that.
[60:18.49]Okay.
[60:19.33]Okay, okay.
[60:21.25]Tab to bury?
[60:22.39]Okay.
[60:22.77]It's tab to bury.
[60:23.77]That's what Chad says.
[60:25.19]Oh, okay.
[60:26.07]Shift, someone says shift.
[60:27.63]Is shift buried?
[60:29.49]Ah, control.
[60:30.05]Okay, it's control.
[60:30.89]Okay, we're good, we're starting, okay.
[60:33.05]Go for it.
[60:34.66]Alright, let's play some Dark Souls here.
[60:38.27]Get ourselves some... Excuse me, sir, I'm trying to do a...
[60:43.98]I'm trying to complete something here if you'll kindly back off of me.
[60:47.87]Thank you.
[60:48.23]Number 16.
[60:49.33]What's the accent here?
[60:50.37]Oh, well, I figure, you know, this is the new Jerma, right?
[60:53.73]Yeah.
[60:54.27]Well, why would we want the same old cookie-cutter Jerma when we could have a new Jerma?
[60:58.03]You know, I think maybe new Jerma could, like, be like a cowboy and have, like, a beard.
[61:02.43]So, you know, like, we want to constantly be improving.
[61:05.04]Right, right.
[61:05.62]So, you know, that's why I think we should kind of keep it going but constantly strive to do better.
[61:11.46]Okay, I guess I follow you on that a little bit here.
[61:15.26]Are you willing to shave the beard?
[61:18.37]Well, that's a difficult question.
[61:20.17]I guess it depends on if it's worth it, but I suppose I could part with it.
[61:24.35]And you're okay with a 5% royalties on the screen and 95% on the screen?
[61:30.58]Yeah, I suppose given the numbers.
[61:33.41]They're huge, by the way.
[61:34.39]Yeah, that's what I figured.
[61:36.49]Okay.
[61:36.93]Just making sure we get that correct before we sign anything for anybody.
[61:40.57]It should be E to go through.
[61:41.81]Oh, I see.
[61:42.55]Okay.
[61:43.57]If you could be champion grounder, you're the first to do that.
[61:47.17]Well, let's give it the old college try.
[61:49.04]Good try.
[61:49.82]Let's see what we got.
[61:54.57]I need to think about why you're doing this, but number 16, what would you say is your favorite ride at Disneyland?
[62:00.11]Oh, that's a tough one.
[62:01.25]I'd say Big Thunder Mountain if I had to give it the old guess.
[62:04.49]Staying with the country person?
[62:06.37]Well, that's me and the country person thing.
[62:09.86]You're going to lean into that?
[62:13.42]What's your favorite food?
[62:15.12]Oh, I'd say chicken fried steak.
[62:17.64]Still leaning with the I'm from the country?
[62:19.46]Listen, I don't break character ever.
[62:21.81]You better believe it.
[62:24.75]Can I get a look at me, please?
[62:26.07]Yeah.
[62:29.31]Nobody's gonna get that.
[62:31.64]Number 16, can I get you to say, look at me, loudly, and put your hands in the air?
[62:35.16]Look at me!
[62:36.78]Look at me!
[62:37.62]Oh, hold on, gotta drink Mastis here.
[62:40.44]It's good for your health.
[62:42.48]Holy shit, are you gonna be Gundyr?
[62:49.73]I mean, it's Gundyr, it's not that hard.
[62:52.30]Wow, number 16.
[62:54.05]Number 16.
[63:00.21]Alright, GG.
[63:01.43]You just beat Gundam.
[63:03.09]You just did it.
[63:03.83]You just beat Gundam.
[63:04.99]No one's even gone through the door.
[63:06.19]I usually play on controller.
[63:08.43]I don't know if that's a problem.
[63:09.95]Number 16, that was phenomenal.
[63:11.56]I just have to make sure you really wear this.
[63:14.24]That beard, though.
[63:16.12]You just gotta go.
[63:18.92]That beard has to go.
[63:20.30]Okay.
[63:21.20]Well...
[63:22.06]Sometimes we've got to make chamfer flashes.
[63:24.26]Okay.
[63:24.76]Thank you so much.
[63:25.42]That was fantastic, number 16.
[63:26.56]You can send in number 17.
[63:27.52]That was phenomenal.
[63:29.33]Y'all come back now here.
[63:31.45]I don't know why you keep doing this country thing.
[63:33.19]It doesn't make sense to me.
[63:34.39]Because I'm literally from the East Coast, like Boston.
[63:37.37]I could see like a New York, but not a country thing.
[63:39.65]Send number 17, please.
[63:40.49]And that should round us out.
[63:42.87]Number 17?
[63:47.51]Do we not have 17?
[63:48.07]17's not here?
[63:52.66]Number 17 is not here.
[63:54.02]We have number 16 there.
[63:57.54]Okay.
[63:59.65]That's the best we got?
[64:02.37]That's what we got.
[64:03.89]I mean, it was in every classified in the country and all the newspapers in the country.
[64:09.99]Okay.
[64:10.15]This is going to take a little bit of deliberation here.
[64:13.99]I have no fucking idea.
[64:17.06]I'm, give me a, I don't know if I'm addressing this camera here, but like, give me a few minutes.
[64:22.48]I need to think about what I'm going to do about this.
[64:23.85]Because there are 16, there are 16 people here that, I mean, I don't know.
[64:30.37]I have no idea.
[64:31.15]I'm going to need a few minutes.
[64:31.95]Give us a few minutes.
[64:32.85]Let me deliberate on this and think about what I want to do here.
[64:35.71]And we'll be right back in just a few minutes.
[65:02.52]so so
[65:54.57]Thank you.
[66:29.45]Thank you.
[67:03.19]Thank you.
[67:38.07]Thank you.
[68:12.95]you
[68:47.83]Thank you.
[69:24.02]So,

[81:00.18]so
[81:35.63]Thank you.
[82:11.44]So,
[82:44.83]you
[83:21.07]Thank you.
[83:55.68]Thank you.
[84:29.55]you
[85:04.34]you
[85:51.35]So this is harder than I thought it was going to be, unfortunately.
[85:55.41]I knew it was going to be hard, but trying to eliminate people is not my forefront, but I will do my best.
[86:06.76]I'm going to have to say I've spent 10, 20 minutes sitting here trying to figure out what I want to do here.
[86:12.80]I'm going to have to cut.
[86:15.76]I mean, number seven, Connor.
[86:18.64]What are you doing here, Connor Eatspants?
[86:19.90]You have a career going for yourself, for the love of God.
[86:24.07]You're a young guy.
[86:24.95]You've got a great career in front of you.
[86:26.53]You don't got to be me.
[86:27.35]Be you.
[86:28.03]And you're doing you very well.
[86:31.19]Also, I mean, the number 12 didn't know how to play Tetris.
[86:35.97]Just get out of here.
[86:36.97]I mean, what are we going to do with you?
[86:39.71]And then probably at the same time, I mean, number 16 as well.
[86:44.75]We actually talked backstage.
[86:45.87]He didn't want to shave his beard once and for all.
[86:48.19]So I was like, I mean, if you're not going to shave, how?
[86:52.90]Oh, country Jerma.
[86:54.16]That's not going to happen, man.
[86:56.44]That's all I could come up with so far.
[86:59.12]I sat for 10, 20 minutes.
[87:00.90]Remember, this is me.
[87:01.70]This is my shit.
[87:03.18]This is my channel.
[87:05.23]I have to be sure of this stuff.
[87:07.94]So what's gonna have to happen here over the next, I don't know how long it's gonna take, but I've employed a few people to try to really narrow down who I think could be the next Jerma985.
[87:21.09]I need some help.
[87:22.35]I need some more context.
[87:24.91]So let's go ahead and start episode one, season one, episode one, final pilot one, end of the series one, final episode one of Who Will Replace Me on Jerma985.
[87:52.75]Hello, how are you?
[87:53.65]Welcome to Who Will Replace Me?
[87:58.69]I'm Jerma985.
[87:59.63]Welcome.
[87:59.97]How are you?
[88:01.39]I figured this would be probably hard to do.
[88:03.69]So I have employed a few people, at least a handful of people to help me do this.
[88:08.39]And we'll go one by one to find out who could help me decide who could replace me.
[88:14.08]So we'll go back over here.
[88:15.42]We have Ster here.
[88:16.92]Nice to meet you, everyone.
[88:18.46]I've known Jerma a long time, so I've been judging him my whole life, and I feel like I'm specially qualified for this opportunity.
[88:25.23]The camera's over there, honey.
[88:29.71]I apologize.
[88:30.57]He's judging me.
[88:31.29]I know.
[88:32.69]I'm just ready to figure out who the new Jerma is.
[88:34.21]I've been waiting for a new one for a long time, and I hope we get a better result than the first one.
[88:38.24]Yeah.
[88:40.31]By the way, when you talk about judges, I had to bring people in because there's no way I can do this by myself.
[88:46.73]It was impossible to sit there and be like, oh, who's better?
[88:50.47]Who can do it?
[88:51.13]Who can't do it?
[88:52.81]I need experts.
[88:53.63]And Ster has been around for a long time.
[88:55.15]He's been around for about 12 years now since the very, very, very beginning.
[88:58.39]I'm 31.
[88:58.67]I've been around for 31 years.
[89:00.47]We also have Ludwig here.
[89:02.09]Ludwig is also part of the new school of Jerma fans.
[89:04.81]He's been around for the last few years.
[89:07.19]Ludwig, thanks so much for showing up here.
[89:08.85]Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[89:10.65]You know, I'm one of the few people who actually took your role.
[89:13.52]And your chat tried to kill me.
[89:16.13]They did.
[89:16.93]So I'm just trying to make sure whoever we pick today is not at threat to die.
[89:22.13]It's really... I couldn't do it.
[89:24.70]When 16 people come in the room, I can't... It's hard to base who I can do it on.
[89:30.84]I...
[89:33.58]why was that funny I don't know there's just a couple of words there our third our fourth judge is uh somebody a fan favorite of of the channel uh to real he's my doctor he's been around since I can really remember uh to make sure blood pressure uh blood type and all that is is exact uh Dr. schmuckson yes thank you for coming out here thank you thank you so much for inviting me to be on your panel Jeremy and as you know the others might be interested in your talents but as a doctor
[90:03.61]I know Jerma, Jeremy.
[90:06.35]He knows me in and out.
[90:07.55]In and out completely.
[90:08.27]Wow.
[90:08.90]Yeah.
[90:09.56]Blood type, we're talking blood pressure.
[90:11.46]And he doesn't have very much time left, right?
[90:14.48]What, me?
[90:15.36]I didn't think we were going to bring that up on the air.
[90:17.98]Am I dying?
[90:19.18]I didn't know this.
[90:20.72]I'd like to talk to you later about some Jerma facts.
[90:22.70]Dr. Schmuckson, Ludwig and Ster to judge these people because, I mean, we're talking about my replacement and...
[90:29.10]I've been a content creator, you've been a content creator, Ster, for about 12 years now.
[90:33.71]And trying to find the person that can take the brand to the next level.
[90:38.54]We're going to find that now.
[90:40.57]By the way, let's explain how this is going to work.
[90:43.63]We have in front of us here, we have buttons.
[90:46.71]People are going to come out on stage.
[90:48.95]I've eliminated a few people off the bat because I don't think they can handle it, by the way.
[90:53.11]But we have a few buttons here.
[90:55.41]When we press these buttons, they are going to play... Okay, we don't all have to do it.
[91:00.54]We're demonstrating.
[91:01.48]They don't believe us.
[91:04.24]It makes this noise.
[91:05.32]Three...
[91:07.48]Stop.
[91:08.46]Three X's means you are out.
[91:11.14]Three yeses means you are into the next round.
[91:14.48]This is a talent portion of this stream here.
[91:17.23]I, we got Dr. Schmucksen, Ster, Ludwig.
[91:21.85]I think, me, I'm judging you too.
[91:24.07]They're all backstage right now.
[91:25.37]Who knows Jerma better than Jerma?
[91:27.57]Exactly.
[91:28.03]Who would know me, who would know me better than me?
[91:30.01]Nobody does.
[91:30.93]I know, actually, I don't know me at all.
[91:32.93]That's why you were here.
[91:34.67]Yeah.
[91:35.20]You lose yourself sometimes.
[91:36.38]I lose myself sometimes, but it's okay.
[91:39.54]I would like to call to the stage now.
[91:41.22]You got soda right here, because just like that show that we can't say, it's delicious.
[91:46.14]It's got soda in there.
[91:47.46]Drink it up.
[91:49.36]Can we get number one to come out on stage, please?
[91:55.55]Three X's means you are out.
[91:57.41]Three yeses means you are into the next round.
[91:59.73]Number one, how are you?
[92:01.13]I am very well.
[92:01.87]How are you?
[92:02.75]Thank you, number one.
[92:03.49]How are you?
[92:03.93]Good.
[92:04.53]Great.
[92:05.29]Nobody's X'd, right?
[92:06.63]Okay.
[92:07.71]I like the walk a lot.
[92:08.75]That's how you walk around.
[92:09.83]That's a good walk.
[92:10.59]Look at me.
[92:12.43]Somebody got it.
[92:13.57]Finally, somebody got it right.
[92:15.35]Number one, what are you going to do for us today?
[92:16.75]I believe I'm going to juggle today for it.
[92:19.41]Juggling, okay.
[92:19.97]Maybe sing a few bars of my favorite song as well.
[92:22.94]Okay.
[92:24.12]Whenever you're ready, we'll go ahead and get that started.
[92:27.76]Thank you.
[92:29.46]Oh.
[92:32.54]Whoa.
[92:36.63]No, pull it back.
[92:37.71]Pull it back.
[92:38.17]That's not fair.
[92:41.29]Okay.
[92:45.77]I just want the next hour to be this.
[92:48.23]Could you make a Jerma noise while doing it?
[92:51.08]HIGHER!
[92:52.00]HIGHER!
[92:53.60]Oh he dropped one, what do we do about that?
[92:55.78]HIGHER!

[93:04.96]Take that back!
[93:05.52]He did ah-ee-oo!
[93:07.18]Does he think we meant higher in notes?
[93:08.60]Fan, I... I'm not gonna say anything
[93:18.76]Is that it?
[93:19.18]Here, I'll try one more for you.
[93:21.23]Hold on.
[93:21.59]Great.
[93:21.79]I got one more.
[93:22.53]Here we go.
[93:22.89]Ready?
[93:23.11]See if I can pull this off.
[93:28.07]Here we go.
[93:30.13]Whoa!
[93:31.03]That might have got me.
[93:32.21]That got me.
[93:33.21]Wow.
[93:34.97]Number one.
[93:35.73]Number one.
[93:37.77]Okay.
[93:39.29]Chefs, I would say I'm going to have to be a yes on this one.
[93:45.22]You know, I was almost a no, and I was sitting there and I was thinking, he's not doing anything with the lower half of his body.
[93:50.61]And then when you incorporate it, the leg, what?
[93:55.85]I'm sorry.
[93:56.67]You've been disqualified.
[93:57.91]I get it.
[93:58.37]I totally understand.
[93:59.89]It's okay.
[94:00.83]I enjoy the performance, um, can you explain what the thought process between, uh, ah-ee-oo was?
[94:07.29]Very good, very good idea.
[94:08.63]That is, that is, it's the greatest song in the world, it's my favorite song.
[94:11.85]Could you give me just a five second interpretation of what a raid song is?
[94:16.71]Okay.
[94:18.45]A raid song?
[94:19.05]A raid song.
[94:20.01]A raid song.
[94:20.69]Yeah.
[94:22.47]Ah-ee-oo!
[94:24.15]Ah-ee-oo!
[94:24.89]Pull it back.
[94:26.65]Pull it back, he goes first.
[94:28.56]I don't know what my status is right now.
[94:30.40]What do you have to say?
[94:34.20]Yes, yes.
[94:35.24]Thank you.
[94:35.74]Number one.
[94:38.19]I just try to match things.
[94:42.59]This person at the other end of the table.
[94:45.31]What is your basic metabolic rate?
[94:48.48]Yeah.
[94:52.51]So we got two x's here so far I think you pulled it back, I don't Did you pull it back?

[95:20.13]What do you want from our side, from our delegation?
[95:23.22]He's got the look.
[95:24.16]Uh-huh.
[95:24.82]He's got the passion.
[95:26.45]Schmikes and Ludwig, I would pull it back.
[95:28.45]Can you do the thing one more time?
[95:29.89]Which thing?
[95:30.53]The leg, the leg.
[95:31.27]The juggling leg thing?
[95:32.53]Yeah, just one more.
[95:33.53]One more time, please.

[95:40.00]No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.
[95:43.00]Why would you say no?
[95:45.00]I say no cuz he dropped it.

[96:03.00]Number 1!
[96:05.25]Okay.
[96:06.00]You're not known for your clutch.
[96:07.00]He's got one trick and two notes.
[96:08.00]But he- but he went under the leg, that's a huge deal.
[96:10.00]It is.
[96:11.00]Number two, if we get number two to come out.
[96:14.00]Ster, you got your X, we gotta clear it.
[96:17.35]Now, Dr. Schmoikson.
[96:18.99]Yes, sir.
[96:19.53]You have tested all the blood pressure, all the blood types, all the different height levels of all the patients here.
[96:29.00]Can you reliably say that all these people could be the next Jerma I-95?
[96:34.20]With some stipulation, I think that they're very close.
[96:38.89]Okay, good.
[96:40.51]I apologize.
[96:41.29]We're calling them patients?
[96:45.11]I mean, it's M1.
[96:45.97]We're going on patience.
[96:47.65]Okay.
[96:47.91]Thank you.
[96:49.84]That's not for you.
[96:50.98]That's not for you.
[96:51.52]Alright.
[96:52.36]Tell us your name.
[96:53.24]It's a pleasure to meet you.
[96:54.20]My name is Austin.
[96:56.02]Okay.
[96:56.38]And I'm gonna play a little song for you guys.
[96:58.84]Okay.
[96:59.26]Don't.
[96:59.64]What's the wrong name?
[97:02.21]Shouldn't.
[97:02.69]I'm sorry.
[97:03.19]I guess.
[97:03.47]I agree.
[97:04.75]Your name's supposed to be Jerma.
[97:07.27]Austin doesn't make sense.
[97:09.35]Is it Austin985?
[97:09.93]No, clear the board.
[97:10.83]Clear the board for the love of God.
[97:14.39]Oh wait, wait, wait!
[97:15.07]You have my attention Clear the board Clear the board Are we all clear?
[97:19.47]I think we're cleared I think we're cleared Number 2 I think we're clear Ready to go What are you gonna do for us today?
[97:23.08]I'm gonna play a little song for you guys Okay Alright Sounds good
[97:42.76]The vocalist told me that my heart would grow Older the man, yeah, the stronger the stone Am I losing my mind Am I growing backwards
[98:13.58]I was young when love was full, now it's so serious Woo!
[98:21.76]Better Jerma!
[98:22.80]Hey, I wouldn't say that.
[98:27.38]The real Jerma would have got distracted by that.
[98:31.12]Paused and talked about it.
[98:35.18]It'd be nice to have music or something.
[98:38.74]Don't you think it's like too much, though?
[98:40.74]Music Mondays.
[98:43.30]Is it fun?
[98:44.08]Yeah, I'm actually, I'm rescinding.
[98:45.80]Music Mondays, let's go.
[98:46.74]Alright, number two!
[98:47.92]Number two, thank you so much!
[98:49.45]Number two.
[98:50.89]Very very good job, number two.
[98:52.13]Ah, thanks so much.
[98:53.39]We have a couple of, one no, for instance, here.
[98:57.64]You know, I'll take it back if you can answer this question well.
[99:01.04]I mean, you already got three yeses, but, you know, maybe you can make your case.
[99:04.20]Alright.
[99:05.84]Really, why do you want to be Jerma?
[99:08.19]Yeah.
[99:08.81]Well, I just feel like, you know, teaching kids how to farm properly and maintain their farms would be the best way to use my streaming services and taking over for Jerma.
[99:17.99]I mean, what a great audience.
[99:18.99]He's got a good point.
[99:19.98]Does he?
[99:21.06]Oh, you said it was...
[99:23.57]You can't just keep going sort of Can I ask you a question?
[99:26.09]Uh huh How tall are you?
[99:27.57]I'm 5 foot 8 Perfect Perfect Dr. Smikeson, you have anything to add to that?
[99:33.37]Yes.
[99:35.03]Actually, number two, I thought that was polymorphically Austin.
[99:39.35]Awesome.
[99:40.39]So I guess it's a go.
[99:43.14]It's a go?
[99:43.66]Yeah.
[99:44.46]Yeah.
[99:44.74]You know, one X, but I'll take all three.
[99:46.90]No, that's a yes.
[99:47.60]That's a yes.
[99:47.94]You're going on to the next round.
[99:48.82]Alright.
[99:49.32]Great job.
[99:49.76]I want to make sure.
[99:50.50]Great job.
[99:51.38]You can't just fucking press the button over and over again.
[99:53.94]I don't want him to be the new you.
[99:55.69]That's annoying.
[99:56.13]You're better than that, Jeremiah.
[99:57.45]You're annoying.
[99:59.17]You're annoying.
[99:59.85]I'm here for you.
[100:01.98]Can you switch seats with him potentially?
[100:05.26]Are we all clear?
[100:05.96]I'll be good, I'll be good Can we send out number 3 please or whoever's in the next in line here?
[100:09.22]I'll just pick whichever person you pick Holy smokes we got number 3 here Wow I'm here!
[100:14.33]Look at me!
[100:15.53]He's got a look at me Right?
[100:17.45]Right?
[100:18.31]You have nice arms right Jeremiah?
[100:19.89]No, I've got arms yeah Oh, yeah Are you in the gym more than once a week?
[100:25.09]I mean, home gym Okay, home gym, he's got a home gym, that's pretty good So number three, what are you going to do for us?
[100:31.31]It seems like you already kind of have an idea here Well, I mean, stilt walking is pretty much an atmospheric talent So normally it's for creating an illusion of, you know, heightened magic without the actual magic How tall are you right now, do you know?
[100:50.24]taller than you Okay I hear you're 5'8 but I can teach you That's fucked up In your retirement you can be as tall as me because I am also 5'8 Oh Yeah How tall do the stilts make you?
[101:03.31]Is it 7 foot?
[101:05.97]About 8 foot Okay, that's a lot of foot Right Alright, so are you gonna do a routine for us?
[101:12.03]Are you gonna walk around or?
[101:13.80]More or less it's kind of like I said it's more of an atmospheric talent where you can
[101:21.13]More or less do photo ops, but in a world that we all live in, me and you, I can reach taller things.
[101:28.36]So I feel like I'm an improved Jerma.
[101:30.74]And as you can see, I'm also firma.
[101:35.98]Firma.
[101:38.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't clap yet.
[101:41.66]Excuse me.
[101:42.70]We're allowed to have our own thoughts.

[101:53.54]I will actually, from earlier, I want to correct a mistake that I made.
[101:57.74]I said I didn't like rats.
[101:59.54]I want to make it clear that I do like rats, as long as I am the large rat that makes all the rules.
[102:05.60]Interesting.
[102:07.28]Is that why you have a wolf tail on, sir?
[102:11.04]You know what?
[102:11.98]The internet is very limited on what you can buy in two-day shipping, OK?
[102:17.18]It's a global pandemic.
[102:18.38]True, true.
[102:19.48]The ports.

[103:20.12]That's actually phenomenal.
[103:22.20]A very good try.
[103:23.48]It would have been fun to see him hold something out of reach from you, and then you jump at it.
[103:27.34]I'm going to press your X. Okay, sorry.
[103:30.52]I'm sorry.
[103:31.06]That was just an idea.

[104:02.03]Yeah, cat-dog.
[104:02.65]Like the show.
[104:03.45]No, no, no.
[104:04.57]It's not like the show.
[104:05.25]It's just cat-dog.
[104:06.23]Cat-dog.
[104:06.69]I'll take it at face value.
[104:07.73]I'll take it at face value.
[104:08.39]Yeah, take it at face value.

[104:11.67]What are you doing?
[104:12.69]I love CatDog, you want me to?
[104:13.54]He's doing Cat- he's doing CatDog I don't know what that- I don't know what that means Can you give an artist the stage for once?
[104:18.26]What is CatDog?
[104:19.46]You go live and you say we're playing Blumplekin 3 today and no one questions that so you know just give him a shot That's true We're playing CatDog Number 4?

[104:55.56]Woo!
[104:56.30]Woo!
[105:09.93]absolutely fantastic performance I think the best we've seen all night we can all agree that was that was great I don't think so well I I have the feeling that he suffers from dermatitis but um having that been said I'm good I I I am am I the only x here do you get Jerma titus from eating ass
[105:32.68]What's that?
[105:33.14]Sorry, what did you say?
[105:34.68]No, just from eating X, that's what he- From eating ass?
[105:37.52]X, X, X. He's speaking about the posterior.
[105:42.53]Do we have a 2v2 here?
[105:44.81]You know, the ass talk pulled me out.
[105:46.51]Can you make some more barking noises, please?
[105:48.39]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[105:50.78]Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
[105:52.90]Do we have a 2v2 here?
[105:53.76]No, I pulled it back.
[105:55.14]It's just you, I think, that do not enjoy this.
[105:58.54]I'm not sure about that.
[105:59.40]But an old aging Jerma wouldn't know the new one if it marked.
[106:02.28]I mean, the cat and the dog thing, it was kind of weird.
[106:04.27]I don't know why you have cats and dogs and shit.
[106:06.43]He was weird in the first phase as well.
[106:07.83]And you didn't like the other guy for the tail.
[106:10.35]I'm noticing like a- He said he was a wolf.
[106:11.85]What about Otto?
[106:12.95]Think about Otto, man.
[106:13.79]Otto.
[106:14.09]Get your hands off me.
[106:15.45]Can I ask you a question?
[106:16.77]Sure.
[106:17.34]What do you think about like a stream where you pretend to fight yourself?
[106:22.12]Like a psychopath.
[106:25.50]I'm not a psycho.
[106:26.64]No, I'm just- Cool.
[106:27.64]Isn't that a cool stream idea?
[106:28.96]I mean, it's a cool idea, but I don't know.
[106:31.65]This is like fighting yourself as an animal.
[106:33.39]He's a little too weird for me.
[106:35.43]I think that's why we like him.
[106:36.73]Yeah.
[106:38.87]If we're all in agreement, gentlemen.
[106:40.63]Am I getting vetoed out here?
[106:42.43]It's 3-1.
[106:43.95]I'm sensing that in general, you're not ready to let go.
[106:48.05]Time's changed, man.
[106:49.03]Number four, congratulations.
[106:50.25]You move on to the next round.
[106:53.24]Congratulations.
[106:54.80]I love that guy.

[106:58.36]Unfortunately, but we can sit on the next contestant, please.
[107:01.44]Buy the golden buzzer.
[107:09.93]Number five, how are you?
[107:11.27]Good, good, good.
[107:12.09]How are you?
[107:13.12]I'm doing fantastic.
[107:14.26]We're doing well.
[107:15.80]Welcome to the stream, of course.
[107:17.06]Welcome again for the second time.
[107:19.88]I see a guitar.
[107:20.76]What's that mean here?
[107:21.70]Well, they handed it to me backstage and said that if I don't play it, then I can't get any coffee, Cheetos, or chicken, which I was promised here.
[107:31.59]Okay.
[107:31.93]That's good.
[107:32.91]That's a good callback, I think.
[107:34.39]That's a pretty good callback.
[107:36.86]What are you gonna do for us?
[107:37.96]What are you gonna do?
[107:38.46]I am, uh, supposedly I'm gonna be playing a song that my mother wrote me.
[107:43.02]Your mother, okay.
[107:43.72]Yeah.
[107:44.72]Okay.
[107:45.10]It's the hardest song I've ever had to learn in my entire life, you know.
[107:49.08]Let's go ahead and hear it.
[107:50.02]Alright, hopefully it is.
[107:53.47]Alright, electric guitar, holy smokes.
[107:55.55]Um...
[107:57.28]My mom doesn't love me.
[107:59.12]She doesn't love me.
[108:26.77]I just want some coffee and Cheetos and chicken.
[108:38.26]Number five!
[108:39.88]Wait!
[108:40.84]Number five before you get off stage I just want to say it looks like every judge has said uh has said no Emphatically Emphatically, yeah Absolutely rubbish Don't do this stupid That's a different show!
[108:55.99]That's a different show Number five we really think that eventually going forward here that you could probably do more with you know maybe eventually you'll be I think there's a reason she didn't love you
[109:10.21]Someone needs to tell him.
[109:14.72]Well, I just have to say this, that I would like to see you improve your talent, where I do appreciate that.
[109:24.04]And we've all been through things where, you know, your heart expands as much as it can.
[109:30.91]Right.
[109:31.91]Oh, excuse me.
[109:33.45]Maybe next year.
[109:33.95]Maybe next year.
[109:34.51]I'm so sorry.
[109:41.12]I mean it's really emotional I can't do this I think you have talent you have what it takes but maybe not for this exact setting but you are so smart you're so good you're so talented why you everyone should cry during the segment I'm always upset everybody needs to cry you shouldn't encourage him I would I would pick up a new hobby
[110:06.89]No you have to really cry otherwise they won't believe it!
[110:10.69]Really pick one up that's new I'm ready to cry!
[110:14.11]You can do it you can do it you can yeah Thank you so much number five you're so you're so you're such a fucking angel!
[110:21.64]Thank you!
[110:25.26]He had cheetos!
[110:27.28]He had one of three I don't know why is everybody crying?!
[110:31.96]Thank you Number six please come out please
[110:35.10]Resend your number six.
[110:36.93]We have a little bit of a thing for number six.
[110:38.65]Oh, yeah.
[110:39.69]So number six, we have a small package for number six.
[110:42.21]I see.
[110:42.81]Just to see.
[110:43.25]Small package.
[110:44.45]Already Jerma.
[110:45.07]Hey, that's not true.
[110:47.23]Wow.
[110:48.35]Talked to Dr. Swanson earlier, so.
[111:00.31]It's a small beach town that leads right into the Atlantic Ocean and has the oldest boardwalk in all of America.
[111:06.81]My father opened this candy shop in 1956 and he built it into the place that it is today.
[111:13.82]Sadly, he passed away in 2012 and since then
[111:21.10]I took over the helm of the candy shop.
[111:24.08]I'm actually such a large Jerma fan that I named our specialty chocolate fudge after him, the Jolly Jerma.
[111:31.21]Sadly, it's one of our least popular items.
[111:36.11]The one major issue with running a shop in Beachtown is that basically all of my business comes during the summer.
[111:43.09]That means that nine months out of the year, I have almost nothing to do.
[111:48.02]Hearing that Jerma's retiring, I believe this would be the perfect job for me to spend the rest of my time during the year.
[111:57.42]Okay.
[111:59.05]Let's go ahead and bring him out.
[112:02.47]What an interesting story that was.
[112:04.07]You got it, number six.
[112:05.69]Number six.
[112:08.34]What an interesting story, number six.
[112:11.98]Hello, how are you?

[112:21.16]I guess we're going to go through this a few times, yes.

[115:27.33]That was not Yoda based.
[115:29.09]That was out of character for what Yoda's speech patterns are.

[123:42.13]Number eight, thank you so much.
[123:43.81]That was phenomenal.
[123:44.67]Number eight, we have one ex from Ludwig, and I'm very curious why.
[123:48.17]Yeah, I want to talk to you directly.
[123:49.89]Of course.
[123:50.87]You're selling yourself short.
[123:52.85]I'm thinking you, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, okay?
[123:57.13]Steve Jobs.
[123:59.13]You're doing things that Jerma dreams of at night.
[124:02.37]Right.
[124:02.73]He falls asleep wishing he could sing and dance like that.
[124:05.15]You don't know how much that means to me.
[124:06.46]Like, it's been years.
[124:08.08]You know, just like trying and trying and trying.
[124:10.06]I mean, this might be my big break.
[124:13.22]I want you to know this no is another door opening.
[124:19.56]What about this no?
[124:21.51]What's that?
[124:21.95]What are you thinking, Jeremy?
[124:23.45]I'm having trouble.
[124:24.87]Tell me what you're having trouble with.
[124:25.95]Maybe we can work this out.
[124:27.51]The keyboard coming out, it was a little too dragged out.
[124:30.68]I was a little... You're saying no to the voice of a generation.
[124:34.48]Wait, wait.
[124:34.94]I might be able to work on that.
[124:36.82]We'd have to, you know, tech in.
[124:38.28]I know, I know, but I'm having trouble.
[124:41.22]I think I'm going to have to phone a friend.
[124:43.76]Let's go ahead and call.
[124:45.30]Can I phone a friend here?
[124:46.68]Just get some advice here.
[124:48.95]It's very tricky, that keyboard was fantastic but it was a little drawn out Not like what's happening right now Can we?
[124:57.77]You're great darling I appreciate that thank you Can we connect to Kitboga please?
[125:04.74]I'm phoning a friend here 444 I think we're a little split on this I don't know why you flew in here Why would you be getting a ring if you're Hello?
[125:16.67]Kitboga, hi, this is Jerma985 calling through some cell service device.
[125:22.20]I want to get your advice on something.
[125:24.44]What?
[125:26.48]Sorry, who is this?
[125:27.64]It's Jerma985.
[125:29.80]Jerma.
[125:30.88]Oh, hey.
[125:32.43]Are you watching the stream, Kit, right now?
[125:36.49]I'm just trying to finish this 200-word essay.
[125:38.63]What?
[125:38.77]Yeah.
[125:42.13]Okay, so I got a guy up here.
[125:43.61]He's number eight.
[125:44.64]He played the piano.
[125:45.80]He's really funny.
[125:46.54]He's really interesting.
[125:48.54]I need some input on if you think that he could move on to the next round as the next Jerma.
[125:54.42]Have you been paying attention to the stream at all?
[125:57.47]I mean, it kind of depends.
[125:59.65]Do you want my opinion or do you... I need your opinion.
[126:02.59]You're one of the two calls I can make.
[126:03.99]If there's one more person I can call, which you'll see very soon enough.
[126:08.54]I'm not really that good under pressure.
[126:10.64]Well, I need it now.
[126:12.26]That guy clearly is, though.
[126:14.56]Number eight, clearly.
[126:15.72]Clearly is no.
[126:18.76]So, okay, okay.
[126:21.32]I'll tell you what.
[126:22.62]Whoever said money can't solve your problems must have not had enough money to solve them, right?
[126:28.73]Ariana Grande?
[126:29.51]What are you talking about?
[126:32.56]Ariana Grande.
[126:33.70]Yeah, but what is that?
[126:34.90]Did you like number eight or not?
[126:36.38]Like, what does that do with Ariana Grande?
[126:37.62]The point is she says, I want it.
[126:40.44]I got it.
[126:41.54]I want it.
[126:42.00]I got it.
[126:42.64]I feel like this is you.
[126:45.10]Yeah.
[126:45.30]What do you want?
[126:47.30]I want my replacement kit.
[126:49.74]It's hard to do.
[126:51.61]I love Ariana Grande.
[126:54.05]Okay, put it back.
[126:54.81]Wait, what?
[126:55.17]Yeah.
[126:58.22]He loves Ariana Grande.
[126:59.22]Put him through.
[127:00.08]That's your criteria is if they like Ariana Grande is pass him through.
[127:04.31]She's really popular right now.
[127:05.71]She's hot.
[127:06.37]She's hot.
[127:07.29]She's popping off.
[127:08.37]Kit, thanks for absolutely nothing.
[127:12.21]She's hot shit right now.
[127:13.43]Don't spill that soda!
[127:14.31]It's sponsored!
[127:18.10]I got some input.
[127:21.54]Number eight.
[127:23.76]Oh, yeah.
[127:24.28]We have a yes from Dr. Schmikeson.
[127:26.00]Is that what it is?
[127:26.98]Yeah.
[127:27.50]Well, I have to say, you almost had me in tears, but I just have to say, quite uber-geromaniac.
[127:39.73]Definitely uber-geromaniac.
[127:41.50]Thank you.
[127:41.80]That means a lot.
[127:44.50]Number eight.
[127:44.90]I'm going to have to tell you.
[127:49.32]Congratulations.
[127:50.56]You move on to the next round.
[127:54.57]Really good.
[127:55.25]Really good stuff.
[127:56.03]Thank you so much.
[127:57.09]I really won't let you down.
[127:58.09]Sky's the limit.
[127:58.67]This is going places.
[127:59.45]Sky's the limit.
[128:00.63]Thank you.
[128:01.11]Thank you.
[128:01.67]Number 8, you've moved on to the next round.
[128:03.71]I didn't like him one bit, honestly.
[128:05.47]Why did you say yes?
[128:06.33]He couldn't take it.
[128:07.27]You're an idiot.
[128:07.99]Why would you vote yes?
[128:10.55]He would shatter at any negativity.
[128:13.75]Why would you say yes?
[128:14.51]Just like a Jerma.
[128:16.23]I don't shatter at negativity.
[128:17.97]Oh, that's a good, that's why he passed it through.
[128:19.41]Look where he's going right now.
[128:20.87]I do not shatter at negativity.
[128:22.49]I'm getting upset at it.
[128:23.11]No, I don't.
[128:24.27]I take a lot of shit I feel like you're not listening to what Kit said He said Ariana Grande's He said no, then he said yes, it was hard to tell I want it, I got it Okay Clear your boards please, we have the next person coming up We're clear Where's my chapstick?
[128:41.80]I'm about to freak the fuck out Negativity I've got some on my lips I don't Excuse me
[128:51.08]Alright, number nine is out here now.
[128:52.88]Number nine, how are you?
[128:54.02]Welcome to the screen, number nine.
[128:55.76]It works.
[128:58.77]Don't tap it, please.
[128:59.89]Audio issues.
[129:00.43]That's a good Jerma one.
[129:02.13]There we go.
[129:02.49]Very good.
[129:04.03]Hi.
[129:04.85]Hi, number nine.
[129:05.71]Hi.
[129:06.49]How are you?
[129:07.35]I am doing excellent.
[129:08.59]Are you excited?
[129:09.41]I am literally shaking right now.
[129:11.76]You've moved this far, number nine.
[129:14.02]We need a wow factor here.
[129:16.18]Okay.
[129:17.14]I'm going to bring, you know,
[129:19.94]I consider myself to be a dancer.
[129:23.36]A dancer?
[129:24.02]A dancer.
[129:24.98]Something of a dancer myself.
[129:27.24]It's a reference.
[129:28.50]It is.
[129:28.94]That's a theater?
[129:30.26]That is a theater.
[129:31.69]So are you going to do a dance routine?
[129:33.81]Yes, I'm going to show you some break dancing here today.
[129:37.61]I'm going to just use the entire area, break it down for you guys a little bit, show you my moves.
[129:42.85]Are you aware the real Jerma cannot break dance?
[129:45.31]That's bullshit.
[129:45.93]I can't.
[129:48.04]It's debatable.
[129:50.11]I've been inspired by some of his work.
[129:52.75]It looks like he's going to come up to the stage and he's actually going to preview it.
[129:56.73]I don't know how I'm going to follow this up.
[129:58.37]Get out of the way.
[129:59.27]Get out of the way.
[130:02.17]What did you, sir, what did you say?
[130:03.87]I said the real Jerma cannot break dance.
[130:06.31]OK.
[130:06.99]I think he can.
[130:10.39]That wasn't me.
[130:10.89]It was mostly the speed you went.
[130:20.29]I hope he didn't break something.
[130:22.25]We all hope that you have better than that.
[130:24.03]But I wish you luck.
[130:26.23]I scraped my fucking knee.
[130:27.73]The next stream in three months.
[130:32.21]Number nine, can you do better than that?
[130:33.71]Let's find out.
[130:34.29]Good luck.
[130:34.65]Here we go.
[130:39.05]Oh.
[130:39.35]Yeah.
[130:39.73]Alright.
[130:40.15]Alright.
[130:40.49]This is a classic.
[130:41.55]OK.
[130:41.73]Let's get up.
[130:42.63]I don't want to.
[130:43.25]Should we get up?
[130:44.03]Should we stand up?
[130:44.67]Let's stand up.
[130:48.25]I'll half stand.
[130:48.91]I'll do this.
[130:53.75]Warming up He's running at such rapid pace around The cram, the cram That's a crab, that's very, that's good, that's very good Whoa!
[131:05.64]No way!
[131:06.94]Took a bit of a stumble Okay, I thought he was gonna Oh, wait wait, he's got more!
[131:12.96]Oh!
[131:14.06]Oh!
[131:14.74]Holy shit!
[131:16.66]Well, that's the same thing but twice, he gets it!
[131:19.61]Oh!
[131:19.73]Three!
[131:20.21]Oh!
[131:29.11]What?
[131:29.39]What's the problem?
[131:30.21]Why did you say no?
[131:32.45]We got two noes?
[131:33.27]I immediately noed.
[131:34.33]No!
[131:34.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[131:35.79]You stumbled.
[131:36.91]That was fucking phenomenal.
[131:38.77]Thank you.
[131:40.11]Could I?
[131:40.99]Go ahead.
[131:42.39]As an avid Jerma viewer, sometimes Jerma has, through breakdancing, not been able to stream for extended periods of time and when I saw you fall, I had a That's So Raven moment where you were the Jerma and you hurt yourself.
[131:56.56]Where's my streamer?
[131:58.02]Right.
[131:58.78]What do you think about that?
[131:59.96]You have people depending on you.
[132:01.06]You can't hurt yourself.
[132:02.16]Totally.
[132:03.64]First, safety is key.
[132:05.46]Safety is number one.
[132:06.36]Number two, I'm like a starfish when it comes to repairing any sort of my body.
[132:12.92]So just like quick recovery, like day or two in the hospital, just like...
[132:16.50]Dr. Schmoysen, what about starfishes, Dr. Schmoysen?
[132:19.72]Well, I think he's relating to something that has to do with, you know, bones and tendons and so on growing back.
[132:30.41]But I don't think that that works if you become paraplegic.
[132:34.01]Wait, Dr. Schmoysen, what's his blood type?
[132:35.71]Is he AB?
[132:37.31]I believe he's O. Okay, that's a big problem.
[132:40.83]I believe he's O. O, that's a big problem.
[132:43.21]Have you donated before?
[132:44.45]You're a universal donor.
[132:45.91]yes yes yes I have donated blood we are unfortunately we're split again I'm gonna have to phone I'm gonna have to call Etalyx on this one he fell that's the rule I can do it again I can do it again and not fall this time I think he has what it takes he has what it takes okay call make a call can we call Etalyx please yeah of course get him on the line another phone a friend okay only got a few of these
[133:19.55]I thought it was phenomenal.
[133:20.59]I think you guys are out of your mind.
[133:23.49]I still don't get why you get a ring when you call someone.
[133:26.73]Because it's calling them and it's bringing it in their house.
[133:28.69]Okay.
[133:33.17]Do we have Etalyx?
[133:37.25]Hello?
[133:37.51]Are you there?
[133:40.54]Mmm, sure enough.
[133:44.12]I think I dialed the wrong number.
[133:46.24]Try it again.
[133:48.52]We're at an impasse.
[133:50.58]Oh wait, it's ringing.
[133:51.46]It's ringing again.
[133:51.96]I think he's dodging your calls.
[133:53.30]He's got caller ID.
[133:57.06]We need an outside opinion.
[133:58.77]I think he's got what it takes.
[134:02.49]Etalyx.
[134:03.11]Hey, can you hear me now?
[134:04.27]Can hear you now.
[134:04.81]Etalyx.
[134:05.49]You're on Jerma's Not Got Talent.
[134:07.97]That would be a copyright infringement.
[134:09.83]You're on Who Will Replace... That's another copyright infringement.
[134:13.25]Who Will Replace Me.
[134:14.43]Welcome, Etalyx.
[134:15.19]Welcome to the show.
[134:16.29]We have number nine here.
[134:17.05]You guys can hear me?
[134:18.13]Yes.
[134:19.29]I'm number 17.
[134:20.39]You guys already do the interviews?
[134:22.91]Yes, we did.
[134:23.72]You weren't here.
[134:26.82]Yeah.
[134:27.28]Well, number seven, you were not available, so we just kind of cut you.
[134:30.39]So sorry, dude.
[134:31.79]Are you watching right now?
[134:32.87]Do you see who's on stage right now?
[134:37.05]Listen, I'll just be real.
[134:40.24]Yeah.
[134:40.64]It doesn't even fucking matter who you guys pick because all the plus twos are chat memes nowadays.
[134:46.58]Yeah.
[134:47.28]So where's the test to see which of these contestants can pick the correct one guy comment?
[134:52.39]Interesting.
[134:55.02]Okay, well, so you're asking if he can pick a one guy comment at a chat and that should be able to fix if he can do it?
[135:03.93]Yeah, I mean... So number nine, I got a question for you.
[135:08.87]Yes.
[135:09.49]So if there's three comments in chat, one of them says, you're a loser.
[135:14.23]The second one says, hey, like shit into a bedpan and show it on stream.
[135:19.40]And the third person says, hey, Jerma, like you should play Destiny 2 PvP.
[135:23.80]Which one are you going to read?
[135:25.18]uh I'm gonna I'm gonna go with number three and I'm gonna take that advice and and let the haters build me up it's very very good idea very good idea thank you very good Etalyx thank you so much for the uh for the input um but I think we have our decision here one last thing okay yeah I just want to say I've been watching and I can't tell them apart because I I think the ultimate test should be who looks the best wearing a chest brace
[135:51.65]playing VR.
[135:52.57]So if you could just get one of those on stage right now.
[135:54.89]Hang up on him.
[135:56.29]Hang up on him.
[135:56.83]Calls breaking up, I can't hear you.
[135:58.20]Hang up on him.
[135:59.10]Yeah, I couldn't hear anything.
[136:00.68]I couldn't hear anything.
[136:01.66]I'm a size medium if that matters.
[136:03.58]No one was talking to you, to be clear.
[136:05.24]Sorry.
[136:08.87]With that input, I think it goes through.
[136:12.09]You like the picking the Destiny 2 comment?
[136:14.93]I think he's got what it takes.

[136:48.52]That was literally one guy.
[136:49.72]There was only one guy.
[136:50.96]That was like a hundred guys.
[136:52.28]I'm pretty sure in between all that I heard like, Jerma is great.
[136:55.27]Jerma's doing fantastic.
[136:56.83]And you read the one audio as messed up comment.

[137:50.51]So you're here to replace me, of course, ultimately, right?
[137:55.79]Yes, only out of pure admiration, though.
[137:58.07]Okay, cool.
[137:58.57]It's your time to retire, I feel it.
[138:00.19]Can I ask you a few questions?
[138:01.17]We all feel it.
[138:01.97]Please.
[138:02.49]Would you ever play VR games?
[138:07.42]yes would you ever play destiny 2 pvp no okay good good answer your ex was on one more question sir yes doctor uh what is your doctor are you uh what is your blood pressure and I'm warning you that's a trick question okay
[138:33.79]My blood pressure is absolutely excellent.
[138:37.17]It's the healthiest blood pressure I think anyone has ever recorded.
[138:40.23]It's a good Donald Trump.
[138:41.41]Up until today.
[138:42.93]My blood pressure is excellent.
[138:44.27]It's the best blood pressure you've ever had.
[138:47.25]Okay, so number 10, what are you going to do for us today?
[138:50.01]Well, I have this talent that I developed into a skill.
[138:53.79]Over the last handful of years, it all began one day.
[138:56.68]I was in an absolute delirium, and I demanded from my friends to feed me coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[139:05.40]And afterward, I completely lost my mind.
[139:07.63]I went into a fugue state for the next couple of minutes.
[139:10.17]Sure.
[139:10.59]And I found out that this is what I did, and I'd like to show you now.
[139:14.55]Thank you.
[139:14.83]Okay.
[139:15.41]Just need a few minutes.
[139:16.55]Sure, take as much time as you need So he's doing what he did in a fugue state In a fugue state But no longer in a fugue state Dr. Schmuckson, what's a fugue state?
[139:22.92]Take it off!
[139:23.76]What's a fugue state?
[139:24.34]Let's go!
[139:25.56]Woo!
[139:26.30]It's one of those states where Right It's kind of purposeful He's getting naked actually What is he doing?
[139:33.15]What?
[139:33.25]What are you doing?
[139:34.75]Can you take your shirt off?
[139:35.77]His shirt's off
[139:46.42]That's probably so loud.
[139:50.42]This is your talent?
[139:52.32]Yes.
[139:52.86]Yeah!
[139:53.32]This is your talent?
[139:55.58]You're doing great.
[139:56.40]It's a skill I made.
[139:58.03]So what exactly are you doing?
[139:59.81]It's obvious.
[140:00.67]Well, if you pay close enough attention, can I actually get a camera close up here?
[140:04.53]If you pay close enough attention, you can see the fat from my luscious love handles actually sticking to the wood as I press down and then as I come up from the mid-back.
[140:15.54]Interesting.
[140:16.00]It takes a lot of confidence to come on stage and know the wood was correct for this.
[140:19.25]It takes a lot of confidence to take your shirt off on stage.
[140:23.77]Let's be honest.
[140:24.47]And that's what I have for you today.
[140:26.19]Wow.
[140:26.75]That's it.
[140:27.65]I'm floored.
[140:28.43]Great job, number 10.
[140:29.45]Thank you very much.
[140:30.70]Very nice.
[140:31.14]You can put your shirt back on.
[140:32.38]Thank you.
[140:32.88]Number 10, thank you so much for your time.
[140:35.08]I'm a no on this one because I think that was just revolting and disgusting.
[140:37.88]I would never do something like that in my life.
[140:39.78]I don't want the next Jerma985 to be lying on the ground and farting in camera.
[140:43.46]I think it was revolting.
[140:44.18]I think with the hot tub meta coming up and rising, we're going to need some more of this bravado.
[140:49.76]Some more of like a more sexual comedy drama.
[140:52.14]I've been looking for it for years.
[140:53.40]More blue humor.
[140:54.48]More, okay.
[140:55.40]I feel like in the dollhouse, you publicly shit yourself.
[140:59.13]Yeah.
[140:59.41]But you're above that.
[141:02.27]I mean, I don't take my clothes off like on stream.
[141:04.33]It's fair.
[141:05.54]Schmuckson, do we have any input from you?
[141:06.88]I'm a little conflicted on this one, guys.
[141:09.66]You know, physically and so on, that was ridiculous enough that you could be Jerma.
[141:17.99]However, I was a little, you know, I mean, watching things kind of squish, make squish noises on the floor.
[141:25.28]I just, I have to say I'm conflicted, so...
[141:29.82]I just don't know Doctor I'm with you here I'm not as set in stone as Ster seems to be so I don't know I think that I wouldn't do something like that Don't you think there's like something maybe he could do after the show to convince you to fart in front of him?
[141:45.70]What are you talking about?
[141:48.38]Like fart in the parking lot?
[141:50.88]There's a lot of What does that mean?
[141:53.25]What is that supposed to mean?
[141:54.07]Like he's gonna fart in the parking lot in front of him?
[141:55.99]Like fart in his face?
[141:56.83]This is a final kind of test for me
[141:59.25]I want you to imagine you're a substitute teacher and the kids are getting rowdy.
[142:05.25]Yeah, yeah.
[142:06.01]Make a noise to have them silenced down.
[142:08.39]The floor is yours.
[142:09.03]You have a few seconds.
[142:10.11]Good call, Ludwig.
[142:17.57]I'm pulling mine back.
[142:19.43]I'm pulling mine back.
[142:20.29]Whoa.
[142:21.21]Thank you.
[142:22.05]Jerma, don't you think that this would be an... I don't have to convince you anymore.
[142:25.73]The rest of you, this would be an important skill for a Jerma to have if he were going to go to a water park.
[142:29.46]Sir, I don't think you have to convince anyone.
[142:30.60]There's only one X right now.
[142:33.08]He pulled back as well Oh!
[142:34.12]Oh!

[143:09.49]Jeremy, we've been over this.
[143:10.67]We've been over this.
[143:11.51]Doctor, doctor, you've measured my height a dozen times.
[143:14.52]Yes, I have.
[143:15.18]How tall am I actually?
[143:16.22]I don't know.
[143:17.10]You will never take your shoes off.
[143:18.72]So, you know, it doesn't make that easy.
[143:21.80]When you're measuring someone's height and you have to submit it in the record, can you do it with shoes?
[143:27.30]You can ordinarily do it with shoes, but...
[143:32.30]I should say there's something that uh he's kind of hiding from us in the shoes oh okay but how tall am I doctor with shoes what's in the shoes Jerma nothing just what's in the shoes what's in the damn shoes Jerma well you guys why is this such a weird like persecution bullshit I have shoes on I've dressed I wear dress shoes to the doctor is that weird kind of to make sure I'm over five eight and a half I'm cringing no you're not you would go like this

[144:05.03]Alright, anyways.
[144:05.61]5 8-wish-ews.
[144:08.73]Another piano?!
[144:10.67]There's only been two pianos!
[144:12.07]It's not like it's been like all day.
[144:13.27]Like, argh!
[144:15.43]Not the second piano for the whole day!
[144:17.40]This is gonna have to be better than other piano.
[144:19.24]Now that's what I call music.
[144:21.86]It's number 11, right?
[144:22.88]This is 11, yeah.
[144:24.16]Big 1-1.
[144:25.58]Number 11, if you're ready to come out, we're ready to see you.
[144:35.01]How are you guys?
[144:36.20]Very good.
[144:37.64]I noticed your Dark Souls playthrough.
[144:39.00]You didn't really know what you were doing.
[144:40.07]Hopefully you know what you're doing with the piano.
[144:41.97]I sure hope so too.
[144:42.83]I hope so too.
[144:44.52]What are you going to do for us, Number 11?
[144:46.86]Well, I'm actually going to play you a ballad.
[144:49.31]A nice, pretty song.
[144:50.57]Okay.
[144:50.89]I thought I'd change it up a little bit.
[144:51.93]Can I ask you a question?
[144:53.13]Of course.
[144:53.81]If you were hungry late at night, what would you order for McDonald's?
[144:57.21]Oh, boy.
[144:57.67]This is big.
[144:58.95]I have a signature.
[145:00.33]Chicken plain, small fries, snack size, M&M McFlurry.
[145:03.56]Wow.
[145:04.06]M&M McFlurry.
[145:04.82]Just enough calories to pass.
[145:06.38]Exactly, right?
[145:07.18]Just enough to pass.
[145:09.14]Well, go ahead, please.
[145:10.28]We're really excited to see your piano work.
[145:14.22]I love how it's calorie count, not like what, okay So what song are you gonna do for us?
[145:19.64]He already, it's a ballad It's a ballad But what ballad?
[145:22.67]We need to know It's a ballad A ballad?
[145:25.09]The music speaks for itself Schmucks, can you look at a rash on my back a little?
[145:31.13]It's called a strange room A strange room, okay
[145:45.25]No, wait, no, no!
[145:46.51]What?
[145:46.69]He just scared the shit out of me.
[145:48.59]What are you doing?
[145:49.11]It's nothing.
[145:49.91]And he kept going.
[145:50.57]That's really good.
[145:51.27]That's big.
[145:52.17]That actually... You tried to fuck him up.
[145:54.25]Didn't work.
[145:56.08]Don't you press that button.
[145:57.08]I'll be pissed.
[145:59.16]Not again, Gabe.
[146:00.22]A pint's head on the piano
[146:11.93]By the open window Or arm around my shoulder One song after another A church that prays the good news
[146:39.82]I gave you a big finish.
[146:49.06]No!
[146:49.38]It was a good finish.
[146:51.45]No!
[146:51.85]Pull it back!
[146:52.89]Pull it back, that was unfair.
[146:54.49]Convince me!
[146:55.79]Stop with the making me make my decisions, Daddy.
[146:57.99]Okay, listen.
[146:58.87]Did everybody- what the fuck?
[147:00.33]We all buzzed.
[147:01.01]Can I ask you a couple questions?
[147:03.49]Where did you serve your mission?
[147:07.12]You know, it's so funny you say that because I'm actually ex-mormon.
[147:12.00]Ah!
[147:12.52]Yeah, I spotted it.
[147:14.32]You spotted it?
[147:14.98]I spotted it.
[147:15.56]How do you spot something like that?
[147:16.97]It's obvious, Jerma.
[147:17.97]I'm white and I play piano.
[147:19.15]I think that's a dead game.
[147:20.07]You said the word church too.
[147:23.31]It's not a church song.
[147:24.81]Ah!
[147:25.19]Yeah.
[147:25.65]Is it not?
[147:26.23]No.
[147:26.59]It's an original?
[147:28.26]It's a cover by my favorite band.
[147:29.82]Hmm.
[147:30.84]When did you leave the church?
[147:32.30]I thought that was really good.
[147:33.96]When I turned 18.
[147:35.06]No, don't put 20 questions in the box.
[147:37.08]It's just a couple.
[147:37.80]It's not that big of a deal.
[147:39.40]No more questions?
[147:40.56]3 years ago?
[147:41.28]No more questions?
[147:42.20]I do have a question though.
[147:45.12]That doesn't really relate to what the others have been talking about, but could you do that standing on your head?
[147:52.38]Can I focus on standing on my head?
[147:54.94]Actually, yeah, in Amadeus how he does it turned over.
[147:57.34]Can we get some of that?
[148:00.50]I don't listen.
[148:01.52]I'm the only one that didn't say no.
[148:03.61]I thought that was phenomenal.
[148:04.65]I thought you did a great job.
[148:05.69]I don't, I don't listen to any of these jokers.
[148:08.94]I thought that was great.
[148:09.98]Well, thank you.
[148:11.38]You know what my problem is?
[148:13.21]He's absolutely delightful.
[148:15.51]A pleasure to be around.
[148:16.35]Want to know what my problem is?
[148:17.67]That doesn't work, right?
[148:18.85]Second piano guy.
[148:19.71]Well, I think that's unfair.
[148:21.35]Dude, you can't play a piano more than what?
[148:23.53]There's 16 people, Sterk.
[148:25.31]There's so many instruments.
[148:26.81]I just feel like you're riding the coattails of the success you saw from the backstage.
[148:31.82]Anybody changing their vote or is this it?
[148:34.36]I think he's... I think he's too sweet.
[148:37.72]Too sweet.
[148:38.24]Number 11, you're apparently too nice of a person.
[148:40.64]You're too good and nice of a person to take the moniker of me, who is also a nice person, who tries to be like nice to everybody and like be cool to like his friends and like his doctor and everything and like have fun with himself.
[148:51.53]Don't listen to all of that, please.
[148:54.47]Okay.
[148:55.18]Number 11, I'm so sorry.
[148:56.14]No, no, Bob.
[148:57.80]I wanted you.
[148:58.30]Thank you.
[148:58.98]Please go live a fantastic, healthy life.
[149:01.54]That's right.
[149:03.05]Number 11, thank you so much.
[149:04.17]Thank you.
[149:05.53]That's unfortunate.
[149:06.91]I thought he had what it took.
[149:08.05]Apparently not.
[149:08.87]I didn't want to ruin a young boy's life.
[149:12.13]I thought he had what it took.
[149:13.47]That's unfortunate.
[149:14.31]I mean, look, because he was an ex-Mormon, who cares?
[149:16.87]It had nothing to do with the Mormon.
[149:18.61]Oh, it definitely did.
[149:19.69]It was because he was too sweet.
[149:21.20]A year on Twitch, he'd be hitting the pipe.
[149:22.82]I can't see him... Wrong.
[149:27.46]He's not unhinged enough.
[149:29.80]Maybe he wasn't as unhinged, but maybe there's a new era of like a nice... That is... That is not the new era.
[149:36.69]You're way off.
[149:37.25]Hey guys, it's me, Jeremiah.
[149:37.77]We're gonna play Animal Crossing today.
[149:39.47]I played Animal Crossing when it came out!
[149:45.44]That was the biggest mistake of your career No it wasn't, it's a fun sweet cute game with like animals and like the KK slider goes like and it's like oh wow what a fucking fun game That's exactly what you're doing right now What?
[149:56.95]You think he's doing that?
[149:58.33]He might No, he would be much more awesome at night Come on, behave yourself Sorry professor Thank you Doctor He's a doctor for god's sake They're the same?
[150:06.25]Are they the same?
[150:06.65]He could be both Can you be both?
[150:08.05]Are you a professor as well?
[150:10.40]Yeah, actually, I am a professor as well.
[150:13.86]That's true, technically.
[150:16.26]What does technically mean?
[150:18.19]Technically means a lot of different things, and I don't choose to name them.
[150:21.97]Okay, alright.
[150:23.13]He's a doctor, he's a professor, he's everything.
[150:24.47]Are we playing 20 questions now?
[150:26.15]Yeah, I mean, you were going off on Ludwig for asking that guy questions.
[150:30.80]It's definitely Ludwig.
[150:31.78]You said his name wrong, by the way.
[150:33.18]That's a fucking X, by the way.
[150:35.24]I'm positive.
[150:36.26]Like, I looked you up on Wiki before this.
[150:38.80]It's Ludwig.
[150:39.58]He doesn't even know his own name.
[150:41.81]I know it, though.
[150:42.83]That's his name.
[150:43.49]It's Ludwig.
[150:44.03]Well, go on YouTube, and there's, like, the pronounce, how to pronounce.
[150:46.75]Yeah.
[150:47.09]It's Ludwig.
[150:48.53]But I don't go by that.
[150:49.63]Ludwig.
[150:50.43]Okay, you know how... Just call him Ludwig.
[150:52.00]It's easy.
[150:57.10]Who do we got coming up next?
[150:58.08]Number 13, I believe.
[150:59.20]Number 13?
[150:59.66]Lucky number 13.
[151:00.78]Number 13.
[151:01.12]What do you got for us coming out here?
[151:05.25]Alright.
[151:05.73]I'm nunchuck.
[151:08.59]Nunchuck.
[151:09.25]There we go.
[151:10.31]By the way, let's make it really clear.
[151:12.37]The nearest hospital, we got to find that because he might hurt somebody.
[151:17.43]Medical kit is in the back.
[151:19.97]We do have a doctor right here.
[151:22.03]If I feel it slipping, I tend not to let it hit myself.
[151:25.28]I'd rather it go out.
[151:26.72]We should duck.
[151:27.26]You guys look like you have quick reflexes, though.
[151:30.80]Quick enough.
[151:31.80]So are you going to do a routine with those nunchucks?
[151:35.00]I'd like to.
[151:36.34]If it pleases the judges.
[151:38.24]Any backstory?
[151:38.88]You were the Russia guy.
[151:40.46]You told us all about Russia and Tetris.
[151:43.09]Oh, yes.
[151:44.79]Did you forget...
[151:46.73]Forget my Russian history?
[151:48.23]What?
[151:48.87]You like, you had a, it washed over you, like you forgot what you did in the previous segment.
[151:53.61]No, he reminded me of my Russian history with Tetris.
[151:58.13]My history with nunchucks is a lot more limited.
[152:01.13]My grandma used to just call me the poor man's Bruce Lee when I was a kid.
[152:04.72]Okay.
[152:05.08]She was off her meds a lot, but I took it to heart, and I decided to pick up the nunchucks in his honor.
[152:11.90]Interesting.
[152:12.30]Beautiful.
[152:13.06]Yeah, it's a thing that kind of stayed with me.
[152:14.58]What is the story?
[152:15.28]Have you ever hit yourself in the nuts with a nunchucks?
[152:17.10]Yes.
[152:17.82]It's kind of a hazard.
[152:20.03]It's gonna happen.
[152:21.15]They tell you with motorcycles, if you ride long enough, you're gonna fall.
[152:24.83]If you chuck long enough, you're gonna... Were there more than three people in the room that thought it was funny?
[152:31.76]Only alone, yeah.
[152:32.98]I like to do really unsafe stuff when I'm alone.
[152:35.06]Yeah, okay.
[152:35.58]So you don't get embarrassed.
[152:37.64]I'm just not sure.
[152:39.62]Was it on purpose in that case?
[152:41.00]Did you do it on purpose?
[152:41.96]No, no.
[152:42.80]Okay.
[152:43.30]No.
[152:43.96]Once.
[152:45.09]So you're going to do a routine with the nunchucks and okay.
[152:47.55]I'd like to.
[152:48.35]Yeah, for sure.
[152:49.01]Number 13, whenever you're ready, for sure.
[152:50.01]Okay.
[152:50.21]Thank you.
[152:52.45]I do dangerous shit.
[152:53.25]That's pretty cool.
[152:54.23]You do, yeah.
[152:54.99]I jump through a window and don't.
[152:55.99]That's true, actually.
[152:56.67]That's true.
[152:57.13]You did.
[152:57.96]You have a history of that.
[153:02.77]Alright.
[153:08.55]So close to his face.
[153:10.29]Whoa.
[153:11.69]The danger.
[153:12.17]Dr. Schwartz is safe in cover.
[153:16.67]Dr. Schwartz is scared.
[153:21.07]Whoa.
[153:22.63]Whoa.
[153:23.65]Wow.
[153:23.95]That's what a flip looks like.
[153:25.35]There's two.
[153:26.03]Give us one more.
[153:27.48]Whoa!
[153:29.71]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[153:31.61]Oh, man.
[153:32.09]No way.
[153:33.65]Who wouldn't want to do that for?
[153:37.94]OK.
[153:38.18]Oh, number 13.
[153:39.14]That was a tease, but that was good.
[153:40.66]That was very good.
[153:41.62]Wow.
[153:42.42]Very good, number 13.
[153:45.25]Do we have any X's at all on this table?
[153:48.21]I'm afraid not.
[153:50.17]Number 13, that was phenomenal, that was unbelievable.
[153:52.45]If somebody would take my place doing something, I mean that was, if you would hit your nuts once in a while it'd be funny, but be careful.
[154:01.34]Oh!
[154:01.70]Oh, of course!
[154:03.56]Oh, he's got jokes!
[154:07.32]Joke's on you I don't have it You got no X's number 13 That's a plus That's a plus That is welcome to the next round number 13 Thank you so much Alright sir Excellent work 13 Thank you It's an obvious choice All about the next procedure operation How many have you passed through?
[154:22.78]Like 4 or 5?
[154:23.48]I think like 2 now?
[154:25.77]What?
[154:26.01]It's like 6 Okay
[154:30.01]What do we got coming up next?
[154:32.77]Oh, another chair sitter.
[154:35.02]Don't call them chair sitters.
[154:36.46]That's bullshit.
[154:37.74]They're a musician.
[154:39.18]I'm just gonna sit on my chair and... Don't streamers... That's his... I sit in a chair and I play like... I was gonna say Among Us, but I never played that game.
[154:47.99]I see you walking around on VR.
[154:49.69]I saw you walking earlier.
[154:53.06]I know that you can do more, I don't know that they can.
[154:56.28]They obviously can because they're dancing and moving around, playing.
[154:58.98]I don't know, are we gonna?
[155:00.10]Are you implying that you don't know if they could walk around when you see them sitting?
[155:03.16]I feel like when you see them come on the stage, like that's the only time they do it.
[155:06.91]Like everywhere else someone's carrying them.
[155:08.31]You don't know if they're standing when they're outside the camera.
[155:10.73]That's completely inaccurate.
[155:12.61]This is a talent that they are showing us.
[155:14.39]It could be like an FDR, like you never know.
[155:16.35]It could be.
[155:18.79]It's a talent for all of us.
[155:21.68]So there's a streaming world and the other world.
[155:25.46]There's a streaming world, yeah.
[155:27.82]Doctor, you know very well.
[155:30.61]Or maybe this is the only world.
[155:33.45]Well, according to the metaverse, we'll be all on the same world soon.
[155:37.65]Some of us.
[155:38.33]If you get The Sims 2 level of graphics and interaction with the goggles that are out here.
[155:46.16]I see.
[155:47.08]Maybe Sims 1 level of graphical integrity.
[155:49.52]Yeah, okay.
[155:50.56]hung up on the graphics but not the connectivity of all mankind and everybody has no legs it's very odd it's very odd it's gonna take off though I think so I really do so in what year are we all floating heads?

[156:37.19]I'm going to play the piano.
[156:38.43]Wow, piano.
[156:39.15]Where did you learn that?
[156:39.97]Don't say wow piano.
[156:41.15]That's me.
[156:42.03]It was genuine.
[156:43.15]That was not genuine.
[156:44.21]It was not genuine.
[156:45.73]Can I redo it?
[156:46.39]It was not genuine.
[156:47.28]Can I take it again?
[156:48.58]Cut this part.
[156:50.08]Start.
[156:50.90]Mmm, piano.
[156:52.52]Wow!
[156:53.10]I'm so sad that he didn't get through Wow, piano, um... Number, everybody quiet Yeah, sorry Number 14, hi Hi What are you going to do for us today?
[157:05.57]Wow, okay, didn't see that one coming.
[157:08.53]Don't listen to that.
[157:09.25]You know, I'm actually named after a penis myself.
[157:11.81]What are you playing?
[157:13.35]Oh, I get it, lewd?
[157:14.89]Number 14, the only person that matters on this stage is me, okay?
[157:18.67]If I like what you're doing, I'm worth like a hundred votes.
[157:22.60]These guys are just here for fucking fluff.
[157:24.40]Don't listen to this bullshit.
[157:25.56]Yes.
[157:26.50]You have a little bit of a thing that you, a package presented to us, right?
[157:30.30]He couldn't trust his own mind, that's why we're here.
[157:32.24]There's a video, we want to see the video first.
[157:35.06]Well, watch the video first.
[157:36.64]My name is Joseph Kostetsky.
[157:38.25]I'm 29 and I've been running an arcade named Joseph's Palace for the past few years.
[157:44.07]Ever since I was a young boy, I loved playing video games.
[157:48.29]I remember I would play Marvel versus Capcom 2 with all my friends at my house and we'd host tournaments.
[157:57.11]I love doing this so much that I wanted to open my own arcade and share my love of video games with the community.
[158:04.65]However, with arcades becoming more and more obsolete, I need a better way to promote my business.
[158:10.66]And because Jerma's fan base is so large, I think I can use this channel to really promote my arcade.
[158:17.54]I found Jerma's just another guy who likes video games, especially the older ones.
[158:22.75]And I feel like that makes me a good candidate for this job.
[158:29.91]Don't clap.
[158:30.79]Don't clap.
[158:31.31]That was beautiful.
[158:33.41]So you own an arcade?
[158:34.93]Yes, I own an arcade.
[158:36.17]And how's that going for you so far?
[158:38.31]Not so good.
[158:38.91]That's why I'm here.
[158:40.39]So we think that you come onto the show and get the channel and then... Yes.
[158:45.28]Convert it to some arcade players, right?
[158:48.18]Would you stream arcade gameplay?
[158:50.09]Well, I view it one and the same.
[158:52.32]I feel like this channel can really be a sponsor for my arcade.
[158:56.44]Okay.
[158:57.30]You said Marvel vs. Capcom.
[158:59.54]Any other games?
[159:00.24]You ever play any Super Smash Brothers?
[159:02.12]Super Smash Brothers is my absolute favorite game.
[159:05.15]Would you play Destiny 2 PvP?
[159:07.31]Stop saying that because people will use it and start writing it in chat all the time.
[159:11.85]Okay.
[159:11.99]What are you going to play for us?
[159:15.13]I'm going to play the piano.
[159:16.58]Okay.
[159:18.08]Let's go ahead and let you do it.
[159:22.68]is the least interesting part of you now you pull that fucking shit back because look at how good that is so I can do it again
[159:56.81]He gave me one stare.
[160:00.19]Number 14.
[160:01.15]Thank you so much.
[160:04.99]That was phenomenal.
[160:27.34]We're at an impasse.
[160:29.40]We have two nos and two yeses.
[160:33.78]I mean, you are the third piano guy.
[160:35.74]I could be convinced with an overhand Amadeus.
[160:42.27]Over the top.
[160:43.81]Amadeus, like the song?
[160:44.83]No, like the movie.
[160:46.05]In the movie, Amadeus, he plays like this.
[160:49.25]While he's drunk.
[160:50.55]Oh, okay.
[160:50.93]To show his skills as a virtuoso.
[160:53.36]Yes.
[160:54.64]Can you, to convince these two idiots, could you do something else?
[161:00.20]Something a little bit more of a fast pace, too?
[161:02.07]Well, actually, Jeremy, my problem was it was a bit too fast.
[161:06.63]You see, for Elise was written for Elise.
[161:09.59]And it was actually really supposed to be a tender, loving song that picked up at times, like the heights of relationships, but also slowed down like the lows.
[161:17.36]Right.
[161:17.76]And I didn't feel the passion come through, although the notes did.
[161:20.96]Right.
[161:21.58]What a beautiful story.
[161:24.24]He's got a point.
[161:26.14]Number 14.
[161:27.23]Yeah.
[161:28.24]That was a phenomenal, phenomenal time on the piano.
[161:31.05]But after hearing from some of the judges... I only know what video game music is.
[161:34.85]What do you got?
[161:36.41]He's played like 6,000 hours of Path of the Devil.
[161:38.57]My favorite genre is video game music.
[161:41.74]I don't understand what you're doing up there.
[161:44.12]I'm just trying my best.
[161:45.58]I think you got, I think you got a great future ahead of you.
[161:48.70]I just got, I just don't really listen to it.
[161:52.32]I thought that was quite lovely, quite lovely.
[161:55.78]But I have a question for you that might make my decision.
[162:01.64]Do you have a bone spur on the left interior of your right mandible?
[162:09.61]No, no, no.
[162:12.41]He's a liar.
[162:17.83]Number 14, I'm so sorry.
[162:19.50]You got a great look.
[162:21.81]I think you got the great look.
[162:23.11]You got the look of the part, but...
[162:25.23]Apparently having a piano is an automatic no from like two people.
[162:28.41]But I don't want you to quit.
[162:29.67]Okay?
[162:30.15]What is it?
[162:31.97]Joseph's Arcade can be a big thing one day.
[162:34.66]It can be a big thing one day.
[162:35.74]I want you to know that.
[162:36.60]No, I'm going to say yes.
[162:37.32]Can you hear me?
[162:37.92]Joseph's Arcade one day.
[162:38.90]It's going to be huge.
[162:39.68]Thank you just for the opportunity to get a chance to get out there.
[162:43.14]Wait, what do we have right now?
[162:44.10]Joseph's Arcade and Piano Lounge.
[162:46.03]They're going to be talking about your arcade in the big times.
[162:48.51]We lost our monitor.
[162:49.59]It's in the big leagues.
[162:50.93]Okay, listen.
[162:52.37]What do we have?
[162:55.52]Thank you.
[162:55.90]Thank you?
[162:56.70]That was very, very nice.
[162:58.23]Very much so.
[162:59.07]Alright, just stop fucking around.
[163:01.26]Thank you.
[163:01.86]I'm a huge fan.
[163:02.52]You were seriously such a great player.
[163:03.96]You should have been the first player.
[163:05.92]Honestly.
[163:06.80]Sorry.
[163:07.32]It was the order.
[163:08.52]Yeah.
[163:09.08]It was a great job.
[163:09.86]It really was.
[163:10.60]It happened like that in Squid Game too.
[163:12.20]But that was such a phenomenal piano player.
[163:13.90]The order matters.
[163:14.70]The order does matter, Jerma.
[163:17.46]A good Jerma's lucky.
[163:19.31]That's true.
[163:20.27]What'd you say?
[163:20.81]What was my character?
[163:21.81]You said I was like 10 luck and like 5 charisma?
[163:24.55]Yeah.
[163:24.79]15% power, 10% skill.
[163:28.07]Okay, my D&D character was what?
[163:30.57]Like if I were to make one?
[163:31.81]I said you would be, you would put everything in charisma and everything else is a dump step.
[163:36.49]Okay.
[163:37.55]By the way, the Myriad is a great show going on.
[163:40.41]It's Myriad.
[163:41.95]Oh, fuck off.
[163:42.53]You're not getting a plug.
[163:44.21]Who's coming up next?
[163:46.17]We got number 15, I think, coming up here.
[163:48.77]Yeah.
[163:50.49]15 should be running us a... Getting down to it.
[163:52.11]Getting down to it.
[163:52.69]Getting down to it, yeah.
[163:54.17]Number 15, go ahead and come on out.
[163:55.59]We'll see what you got here.
[163:57.94]Woo!
[163:58.99]You do hunch.
[164:00.65]A little bit, yeah.
[164:02.81]Hello, Fifteen!
[164:03.57]Hello.
[164:05.31]Clear your X's, by the way.
[164:06.77]How are you?
[164:07.93]Am I clear?
[164:09.39]We're doing great.
[164:10.15]How are you, Fifteen?
[164:12.00]Difficult.
[164:17.32]Fifteen, what are you going to do for us today?
[164:19.48]You got no piano, by the way, so the servers can be happy.
[164:26.57]I like the fumbling.
[164:27.31]The fumbling is like exactly what I would do.
[164:29.21]I think it's just an introduction.
[164:30.91]Can you hear me?
[164:31.79]We can hear you, yeah.
[164:33.07]Okay.
[164:34.29]Hello.
[164:35.19]Hey, good afternoon.
[164:38.62]My ability is doing slightly obscure impressions of people saying very specific things Okay, can you do any serial characters?
[164:50.67]Serial characters?
[164:51.74]Yeah, any serial mascots like Great!
[164:56.48]That's a yes from me.
[164:57.80]You don't need to impress me anymore.
[164:59.02]That is Antonio the type.
[165:00.96]Yeah, that's very good.
[165:02.80]Why do you have an accent now?
[165:06.49]Before I was doing you, I've learned your voice, but I'm new here, so this is... Oh, okay, so you have an accent.

[170:22.70]Give me a one sentence pitch on why I should switch.

[170:28.58]I'm defaulting back to serial character.
[170:31.02]All of his references are dated.
[170:32.94]I think Jerm is intimidated by him being good at the stuff he's not good at.
[170:36.38]Hey, no.
[170:37.65]Just because you know what a serial character is does not mean that you should take over the channel.
[170:42.55]You know what?
[170:44.45]It's Ludwig.
[170:46.04]Oh.
[170:46.56]Sorry.

[173:12.50]Coming back soon in a few minutes.

[188:06.92]Alright.
[188:07.38]OK.
[188:07.54]OK.
[188:10.37]seeing a little bit of uh people talk about number 15 seeing 15 bring 15 back where's 15. we had a deliberation we have four judges 15 was eliminated and that's how you have to handle that 15 impressions are one thing but demeanor way that you talk way that you act you can't just say oh 15 should go through he was a great guy he was really funny don't oh you say that now
[188:40.10]What?
[188:40.30]You voted no too?
[188:42.49]Well, to tack on Doctor... Streamer memory.
[188:45.21]You were talking about how he medically just doesn't even line up.
[188:48.74]Medically, he has bone spurs, I heard.
[188:53.80]Here's the thing.
[188:56.36]In order to play Jeremy, he has to have the physical as well as the... Exactly.
[189:03.70]Listen to the doctor, for God's sake.
[189:05.33]He's a doctor.
[189:06.29]Well, they're probably Americans.
[189:08.07]They don't do that.
[189:09.15]Yeah.
[189:09.39]I mean, obviously...
[189:14.43]The thing to match Jeremy is just be a total maniac.
[189:19.88]But, you know, on the other side, you have to survive him.
[189:24.24]You mean, like, I'm a funny guy, right?
[189:26.06]Like, surviving Jerma?
[189:28.36]Yeah, I know that sounds difficult.
[189:29.58]What do you mean, I'm a maniac?
[189:31.06]A total loony?
[189:32.22]No, I mean, like, a funny guy.
[189:33.75]A wacko job.
[189:34.87]Like, yeah.
[189:35.43]Okay, alright.
[189:36.51]Like, super mean.
[189:37.67]15 is gone.
[189:38.23]He was funny.
[189:39.71]He was nice.
[189:40.63]But maybe he didn't have what it took to be the next Jerma.
[189:45.05]985.
[189:45.85]So what we're going to do now to narrow it down even more, we have to be certain.
[189:51.88]The final round until you, yes you, vote for who is the next Jerma985.
[189:57.80]We're going to bring out the contestants that we pass through and they are going to read a very important passage.
[190:05.68]The JermaCraft copypasta passage.
[190:09.31]However they do it, we are going to vote for it.
[190:12.25]How well they do it, how smartly, how energetically, we are going to vote for them as well.
[190:19.30]This is the final round to the final.
[190:21.66]Whoever goes through this round.
[190:22.90]It's not the final round.
[190:26.20]It's the final round for us.
[190:28.78]And then you get to decide who wins.
[190:31.80]We are going to narrow this down to three.
[190:33.90]But to be clear, you can't decide 15 wins.
[190:37.52]The penultimate round is here.
[190:38.84]Let's see.
[190:40.14]Guys, can we please bring out number one to read the JermaCraft copypasta to see if they have what it takes?
[190:49.56]Yeah, I just want to see you read the ancient text.
[190:51.44]Hello.
[190:52.18]Hello.
[190:52.58]Welcome back.
[190:53.36]Hello.
[190:54.88]Why do you have like a water, like office water?
[190:57.73]It's like a Dixie cup.
[191:00.13]Cider.
[191:01.03]It's cider, okay.
[191:01.75]Cider.
[191:03.71]Are you ready to read the Germagraph copypasta?
[191:05.63]Number one, you've made it this far.
[191:07.19]Are you ready?
[191:08.23]Is it an iPhone 12 Max or 11 Max?
[191:10.51]Don't say that.
[191:11.61]iPhone, who cares?
[191:12.47]Android, doesn't matter.
[191:13.33]It's a private sponsorship I have.
[191:16.85]Shut up.
[191:19.06]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[191:20.78]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[191:26.90]This is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[191:29.60]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[191:35.73]You're going to see lots of fails.
[191:36.89]You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[191:38.95]At least I'm hoping.
[191:40.07]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[191:43.57]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[191:45.69]Let me take a sip.
[191:48.05]Ah, that's some good cider.
[191:49.19]God.
[191:50.73]You said that?
[191:52.07]Oh, that was... You said that's some good cider.
[191:53.69]Oh, he nailed it.
[191:55.31]You nailed it.
[191:55.73]That was amazing.
[191:57.43]Oh, you nailed it.
[191:58.09]Man, I would not watch you play Minecraft.
[192:00.63]Why would you play... Why would I... Why would you watch me play Minecraft?
[192:03.40]It's fucking horrible content.
[192:04.88]I mean, either of you.
[192:06.36]Based on what I just heard, I'm not watching either of you.
[192:08.90]If you... Okay, wait, wait.
[192:09.74]Number one.
[192:10.32]Yes.
[192:10.94]If you took over... Yes.
[192:12.74]What would be your number one video game to play on the first day?
[192:17.09]Man, that is a good question.
[192:18.17]Minecraft, maybe?
[192:19.47]No, no.
[192:20.17]I don't want to press it.
[192:21.03]I don't want to press it.
[192:22.19]No.
[192:22.53]Say anything else, number one, please.
[192:24.45]You get a redo.
[192:25.35]It's a really good question.
[192:27.15]Don't say Dark Souls, either, because nobody got through these two early ones.
[192:29.23]Call of Duty?
[192:29.77]I'm just kidding.
[192:30.47]Don't say that, either.
[192:31.45]It's a good gag.
[192:32.97]But for real, though, now.
[192:33.71]If the brand were to live forever and you took it on, first game you'd play?
[192:40.76]Death's Door.
[192:41.74]Holy shit, that's a pass for me.
[192:44.14]I don't even know what that is.
[192:45.24]Oh, you gotta play Death's Door.
[192:48.03]The bird?
[192:48.71]Why?
[192:49.11]The bird.
[192:49.61]The bird.
[192:51.05]So good.
[192:52.52]That's the bird, yeah.
[192:54.00]You know what this is?
[192:54.84]Yeah.
[192:55.50]What's Death's Door?
[192:56.36]You're a bird and it's like a roguelike and you got to go around and... Maybe other guys have made Titan Souls.
[193:01.38]I don't know if you ever played that.
[193:02.34]Yeah, you're kind of like a Reaper bird.
[193:04.22]Chat.
[193:05.40]It wasn't made 40 years ago, so you might have missed it.
[193:07.82]Nobody Saves the World.
[193:08.78]That's another one maybe I would play.
[193:10.68]Heard of this one?
[193:11.30]Jervis is known for a lot of his bigger streams.
[193:13.18]What big ideas would you bring to the table in 2022 and 2023?
[193:16.36]Exactly.
[193:16.96]Wow, that's really putting me on the spot.
[193:19.04]Mm-hmm.
[193:21.01]Let's see.
[193:22.89]How about while I would be playing, I would also be getting a massage.
[193:29.67]That's actually pretty funny.
[193:30.55]Yeah.
[193:31.55]Okay.
[193:31.99]He goes through.
[193:32.49]Are we all getting a question?
[193:35.29]If you have a question, ask it.
[193:36.33]I want the massage.
[193:37.44]That's funny.
[193:37.98]That's actually funny.
[193:39.18]That's funny.
[193:40.46]That's funny.
[193:40.98]If you could approve upon one thing the current Jerma might not excel at, where do you think you could do better?
[193:48.56]I don't think I would stutter as much.
[193:50.42]Oh, shit.
[193:51.16]OK.
[193:51.86]I'm getting close to pressing the button.
[193:53.70]They ask.
[193:54.12]I'm sorry.
[193:55.30]I said not ask much.
[193:56.36]I would still stutter like a little.
[193:59.20]That was good.
[193:59.67]I like that.
[194:00.89]I want a look at me, and I want it good, and I want it now.
[194:07.31]Look at me.
[194:10.65]He goes on.
[194:13.37]Welcome to the final round, number one.
[194:15.73]Fuck yeah.
[194:17.17]Love that guy.
[194:17.85]Number one goes on to the final.
[194:19.55]To let the first guy go through, but he just did so well.
[194:22.09]It was so good.
[194:23.35]It was actually very good.
[194:24.97]I'm going to hit the next guy with harder questions.
[194:27.45]Please do.
[194:27.81]Tougher questions.
[194:30.13]So number two, we got coming out here.
[194:31.55]We have a package for number two.
[194:33.93]I guess some life story or something we have to hear.
[194:37.31]Like all these shows do, you hear their fucking life story.
[194:39.69]Great.
[194:40.35]Can't wait.
[194:40.67]Can't wait to hear their life story and everybody cry.
[194:42.87]Go ahead and play it.
[194:46.84]I'm Austin S. Faulkner, and I've been running a farm for the last 30 years down in the heart of the country.
[194:51.64]I come from a long lineage of farmers, and we've owned this plot of land for the last 200 years.
[194:56.09]Running it with my wife, Abby, and my two sons, Gregory and Johnny, has been an absolute joy.
[195:01.65]Gregory, my youngest, absolutely loves this guy.
[195:04.93]He's shouting phrases like, look at me, and muck your ass at the dinner table.
[195:10.60]I don't quite know what that means, but my son keeps telling me that this guy's a millionaire.
[195:15.72]saying things like this on the internet every week.
[195:18.34]Teaching today's youth how to properly run a farm through my streaming would be a dream come true.
[195:24.57]And I heard that Jeremy's retiring, so I feel like I'm the right man for the job.
[195:30.45]Okay, so let's go ahead, alright.
[195:42.95]Let's bring our number two.
[195:44.07]Number two, welcome to the stream.
[195:45.95]How are you?
[195:46.55]Welcome for the third time.
[195:47.57]I'm doing well.
[195:49.03]So you got a farm.
[195:50.05]We just heard about that.
[195:50.91]Yeah, it's a beautiful farm.
[195:52.17]You should come visit sometime.
[195:53.46]I would love to.
[195:53.94]You're retiring, right?
[195:54.68]Hey, fresh milk?
[195:55.84]We could trade spots.
[195:57.36]You could run the farm.
[195:58.10]I could run your channel.
[195:59.72]Hey, that's easy.
[196:00.38]25% goes to me.
[196:02.20]Are you not concerned how the farm would end up if Jerma were in control?
[196:07.00]Uh, I think it'd be a lot of more, uh, mocha ass on, uh, on the farm.
[196:10.94]Oh, true!
[196:12.04]Oh, true!
[196:13.48]True, he said mocha ass, everybody loves him.
[196:15.30]Can we do the pog face?
[196:16.40]Everybody likes him, he said mocha ass.
[196:17.74]Do the pog face.
[196:19.32]Well, no.
[196:20.16]That's not even close.
[196:20.98]No, you didn't like that?
[196:22.10]Okay.
[196:22.68]I really didn't like that.
[196:24.28]Did you say, did you say no?
[196:25.16]Yeah.
[196:26.80]Sorry, anyway, if you want to do your, your monolog.
[196:29.56]Can we please hear a Jermacraft, coffee pasta, please?
[196:32.54]And it better be fucking good.
[196:34.48]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the very first episode of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[196:41.62]Now, this is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[196:44.23]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term
[196:48.83]I'm pulling back.
[196:51.13]Because I'm an idiot in this game.
[196:53.43]Now you're going to see a lot of fails and a lot of triumphs, I am hoping.
[196:57.40]So grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[197:00.80]I got a glass of apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[197:04.66]Let me take a sip.
[197:05.36]That's a really good fake sip noise.
[197:09.23]That's a really good fake sip noise.
[197:12.23]That was a good sip noise.
[197:13.81]Alright.
[197:14.81]Thank you.
[197:15.85]Thank you.
[197:16.43]That was a very good sip noise.
[197:18.33]Thank you, I appreciate that, I work on it So we, what do we got?
[197:20.15]We got two and two here?
[197:21.23]Yeah Can I field a question?
[197:22.53]I would love to field a question Please Yeah, yeah, sure I think a lot of Jerma's content revolves around creative ideas What would you do about the situation in Ukraine right now?
[197:30.68]Jesus Christ That's a kind of a touchy subject but uh Just say look at me and it'll be fine Yeah, I'll just say look at me!
[197:39.97]Look at me!
[197:40.65]No!
[197:41.80]That's what you do?
[197:42.94]That you go to Ukraine and you go, look at me!
[197:45.15]Look at me!
[197:46.03]Distracted from all their problems now.
[197:47.85]You know what, Biden and Putin kiss in harmony?
[197:50.87]Oh boy.
[197:51.25]Yeah.
[197:54.03]Doctor, please.
[197:55.31]Doctor, I think he's got what it takes.
[197:56.93]Well, I'm sure that he's arrived far and fresh.
[198:06.22]I do think that you have talent.
[198:09.13]I just don't know if it's the kind of idiocy that we need.
[198:13.73]Oh, no.
[198:16.22]What the fuck?
[198:17.26]Yeah, I'm gonna remain a no based on your foreign policy.
[198:20.06]No!
[198:20.60]Hey!
[198:21.86]Well, I tried.
[198:23.10]Number two, you were such a great presence.
[198:26.66]You guys don't know anything.
[198:27.77]What do you know about me?
[198:28.49]We gotta eliminate someone, alright?
[198:30.01]And this guy's just walking around, look at me, like anyone can do it.
[198:32.75]Am I the next Jerma?
[198:33.71]Can I chime in?
[198:35.35]This man's 36 with no kids.
[198:37.33]Yeah.
[198:37.93]You have a future ahead of you.
[198:39.41]Yeah.
[198:39.59]And it's your family.
[198:41.06]There's a reason he's able to do this at 36.
[198:42.66]Yeah.
[198:43.60]Because he doesn't have one.
[198:45.43]So we want someone who comes in to also not have a family that is more important.
[198:50.19]I don't want to be tied down with real world issues.
[198:54.60]You got to play video games all day.
[198:56.68]What a loser would do.
[198:59.57]You're a winner.

[199:12.42]What a great feeling.
[199:14.07]I got 10 years on everybody at this table besides, of course, the wonderful doctor.
[199:19.55]It depends on what you mean 10 years on.
[199:21.45]It's true.
[199:22.97]You're going to take 10 years from all of us.
[199:25.65]Alright I don't have kids but you know I'm thinking I'm thinking about it I'm thinking I don't got kids so I can spend a few in jail One day you know I'm 36, 37 this year you know you think about kids one day One day One day Maybe we can have one soon Get your hands off of me before I switch seats with Turn your ex off before we get in trouble by production Alright number four please come out number four for your Jerma craft coffee vodka

[200:35.67]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[200:37.15]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[200:40.19]This is the series where I play Minecraft.
[200:43.01]This is a single-player Let's Play.
[200:45.69]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term...
[200:48.85]pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[200:51.47]You're going to see lots of fails.
[200:52.83]You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[200:55.04]At least I'm hoping.
[200:56.44]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[200:59.64]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[201:01.50]Let me take a sip.
[201:04.00]That's a good shot.
[201:07.97]I thought he was pretty good.
[201:08.99]Let me take a sip.
[201:10.63]Yeah, he's got a microphone in his hand.
[201:12.81]He's Sean Connery.
[201:13.71]Was it take...
[201:15.32]Never mind.
[201:16.50]What?
[201:17.58]No way.
[201:18.64]No way.
[201:19.10]You don't put this guy all the way through and then get him out in the last round.
[201:22.00]There was no dog bark.
[201:23.32]Where was the meow?
[201:24.28]I thought it was a ship.
[201:25.58]No, it's not a ship.
[201:26.56]You're actually pretty good.
[201:28.08]You're actually really good.
[201:29.36]I don't know if I agree with these three.
[201:30.84]Okay, so I'm sorry.
[201:32.24]We wanted to get him through.
[201:33.51]You whined and kvetched.
[201:34.71]Now we want to eliminate him and you're whining and kvetching.
[201:36.95]Do you want us to judge or do you want to tell us what to do?
[201:38.87]That was a good Jermacraft copypasta.
[201:41.93]Hit him with some questions.
[201:42.73]Tell me.
[201:43.07]Okay.
[201:43.31]Convince me.
[201:45.40]If you were... Okay, so you're at... You're in line at the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru.
[201:51.80]You're number four in line.
[201:52.80]That's a good question.
[201:53.98]Good question.
[201:54.56]That's a good question.
[201:55.69]You're number four in line.
[201:57.05]You're at Dunkin' Donuts.
[201:57.79]You're donkeys.
[201:59.09]You want a large ice blueberry with easy ice.
[202:04.77]You're number four in line.
[202:06.75]Do you, when you get to the counter...
[202:09.72]are you happy or are you sad how do you interact with the barista at dunkin donuts well I thought the question would be I just spit everywhere sad you're sad why sad because I'm number four and all I've ever wanted to be is number one Jerma
[202:32.92]And I'm sad for the blueberries because the blueberries didn't have to die for me.
[202:36.44]Why are they dying?
[202:37.96]They deserve to live.
[202:38.72]Why are you saying right?
[202:40.06]Okay.
[202:41.46]And I'm sad that they would serve it to me.
[202:43.96]That they would agree to serve it to me.
[202:45.29]But wait.
[202:46.49]Would you drink the whole thing in an hour?
[202:48.69]Fuck yeah.
[202:53.01]It takes me six hours to drink coffee.
[202:55.67]I drank a full coffee in about six or seven hours.
[202:57.57]That is true.
[202:58.25]Also, what was the whole blueberry thing?
[202:59.54]Are we going to just glaze over that?
[203:00.76]He was sad for the blueberries.
[203:02.30]But I mean, you harvest them, you take them, you take their lives, you know?
[203:05.12]No.
[203:06.04]You take their lives.
[203:07.20]I don't.
[203:07.88]I mean, sir, you're a vegan.
[203:08.84]Sorry, doctor.
[203:10.08]Do blueberries have sentient lives?
[203:14.06]I think they're plants.
[203:16.34]And I have to tell you that, you know, I don't know if you are able to go through for me.
[203:26.64]I'd love to send you through.
[203:28.38]You know what I can do?
[203:29.82]I can actually give you a referral for therapy.
[203:35.02]If you need it.
[203:35.96]I'll be right back here in the back of the stage after the show.
[203:40.17]Okay.
[203:40.55]That's great.
[203:42.21]Okay, sir.
[203:44.77]So that's one, two.
[203:46.25]Doctor, is that a no?
[203:50.39]There it is.
[203:51.71]Okay, I was confused.
[203:53.15]Number four.
[203:53.79]Okay, all four.
[203:54.85]I don't know.
[203:56.19]I think you're out.
[203:57.33]Number four, I think that's all we need to see.
[204:00.38]I got it!
[204:01.14]I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[204:02.18]Motherfucker!
[204:03.02]Don't pray!
[204:03.46]Don't mess with this man!
[204:04.40]But don't be so mad!
[204:05.78]By the way, my car is not in the parking lot, so don't, like, key it or anything.
[204:09.18]She's unhinged.
[204:09.72]My car is not in the parking lot, don't key it.
[204:11.42]He's on the loose.
[204:12.64]I think his car is in the parking lot if you want to key his.
[204:16.26]He's got a green sedan.
[204:17.86]And it's got a vanity plate that says, uh, Path of Exile.
[204:21.79]Do you know, like, two things about me?
[204:24.85]And one of them's not even true?
[204:26.37]I don't have a driver's license.
[204:31.49]Oh, you brought me on because I've known you for so long.
[204:33.79]I know you better than anyone.
[204:35.13]Who am I?
[204:38.11]Can we bring out number eight, please?
[204:40.51]Eight should be coming out right now.

[205:04.34]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[205:06.04]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[205:13.27]He forgot his line.
[205:14.11]He forgot his line.
[205:16.31]So when I say let's play, I touch on very loosely because I'm an idiot at this game.
[205:21.06]It was just a fail.
[205:22.46]It's going to be a lot of triumphs, a lot of fails, or at least I'm hoping.
[205:26.24]So go grab yourself a nice cup of coffee and a cup of cocoa.
[205:29.99]I've got some ice cream inside right here.
[205:32.61]I'm going to try to grab.
[205:37.39]I pulled back.
[205:38.31]I want to reiterate something he said.
[205:40.33]Yeah.
[205:41.07]It's going to be a lot of triumphs, a lot of fails.
[205:43.99]I'm hoping.
[205:45.51]He's hoping for a lot of fails.
[205:48.11]Entertainment value.
[205:49.45]That's entertainment value.
[205:50.53]He's right.
[205:51.15]I don't think that's.
[205:52.57]Alright.
[205:53.93]What have we got?
[205:54.75]I think he is tarnishing your legacy.
[205:57.21]Why?
[205:57.63]For what?
[205:57.99]I would never.
[205:58.99]By misspeaking, you mixed up a couple words.
[206:01.56]You had to look.
[206:02.46]But it's hard.
[206:02.98]No one has had to look yet.
[206:04.04]You had to look.

[211:31.20]Number 10.
[211:31.90]You're the lion, you're back fart guy.
[211:33.32]That's right.
[211:33.70]I am the back fart man.
[211:34.50]That's true.
[211:35.98]I think that's on Brandon.
[211:37.33]Sorry for keeping you here.
[211:38.93]Oh.
[211:39.69]What?
[211:40.01]It's okay.
[211:41.15]A lot of people got to go home by now.
[211:43.07]Well, you know, I'm chilling.
[211:44.53]I'm doing great.
[211:45.27]Okay.
[211:45.87]Well, you know, back farting was one thing.
[211:47.53]I'm excited to see you do this copy pasta.
[211:49.67]If you want to.
[211:50.83]Yeah, let's do it.
[211:53.21]You got the floor.
[211:55.16]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[211:56.84]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[212:03.30]This is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[212:06.17]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[212:12.07]You're going to see lots of fails, lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping.
[212:17.43]So grab yourself a hot cup of cocoa, hot cup of coffee.
[212:21.57]I have apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[212:23.36]Let me take a sip.
[212:27.55]That's good cider.
[212:28.41]He made sound effect.
[212:29.69]He made a sound effect.
[212:30.43]Sound effect.
[212:31.65]I like the tea.
[212:32.53]Very effective.
[212:33.21]It felt more like a... Well, you know, to me it was just more of like an NPR read, you know?
[212:42.28]Like I'm listening to radio and they're about to introduce the next song more than a let's play.
[212:47.46]Let's play, you know?
[212:51.36]It's tough because you've got the back farting, you've got the look, you've got the energy.
[212:58.19]I just, I don't know if you got what it takes to be able to order four sandwiches from McDonald's, eat it, and shit your pants.
[213:05.19]Really?
[213:05.43]What makes you say that?
[213:06.67]I just, something about it.
[213:07.43]I'm so sorry.
[213:08.25]I'm sorry.
[213:10.35]You missed the cheat day yesterday.
[213:11.53]That was pretty fucking vicious.
[213:12.47]What is your McDonald's order, if I could ask?
[213:14.49]My McDonald's order?
[213:15.35]Yeah.
[213:16.64]That's four Big Macs and two Flurries.
[213:20.06]That's it.
[213:20.66]That's all I need.
[213:21.36]That's not bad, though.
[213:22.62]It's absurd.
[213:23.32]No, I think the fries are actually pretty overrated there.
[213:25.76]No lie.
[213:26.36]Yeah.
[213:27.22]I have a question for Jerma.
[213:29.06]Sure.
[213:29.44]I think this needs to be cleared up and should have been cleared up earlier.
[213:32.15]How many takes did you do on the original Minecraft episode one before you were like, that's the one?
[213:38.23]How many takes?
[213:38.91]I can tell, like the way it's written, I can tell like you were, it was bubbling, you know?
[213:43.03]Like you didn't do it first take.
[213:44.51]I mean, it was probably 10 takes.
[213:47.08]Look, let me be real to the entire audience watching.
[213:51.02]Every YouTuber that you've ever heard in your whole life, they spend two fucking hours doing their intro, and they hate it.
[214:01.46]They hate every single take they do.
[214:04.18]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[214:07.66]They fucking retake it ten times.
[214:10.06]Aha!
[214:11.26]What?
[214:12.02]And you hated his first take.
[214:14.73]Let's get a second take.
[214:15.65]Second take?
[214:17.25]Two take Tyler.
[214:18.00]I appreciate the opportunity, thank you.
[214:20.00]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[214:25.00]It's the same, it's the same, it's the same.
[214:29.00]No, it's not, let him go! Let him go, let him go. Please.
[214:30.00]Let's get one more from the top please, from the top From the top, from the top.
[214:32.00]And really think about it.
[214:33.00]I pull it back.
[214:34.00]And you're underwater and you're- and you're-
[214:36.00]It's a let's play, you're having fun, you're having fun.
[214:38.00]Number- number 10, you're underwater.
[214:39.00]You're underwater.
[214:40.00]You're underwater and there's submarines everywhere.
[214:41.00]Bloop bloop bloop bloop.
[214:44.41]Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of JermaCraft-
[214:48.00]How are you talking underwater?
[214:49.13]How are you talking?
[214:49.93]Shit, I didn't think of that This is unrealistic I thought it was like Subnautica or something, you know.
[214:54.00]No, it's Minecraft.
[214:55.00]You'd be drowning.
[214:56.00]Fair enough.
[214:57.00]You wouldn't talk if you were-
[214:58.00]You're giving him like unrealistic ways to like go about this.
[215:01.00]This is like the fourth take.
[215:02.00]It just doesn't make sense, if he's underwater why would he talk so clearly?
[215:05.86]Number 10, I think honestly, I think you have what it takes.
[215:08.00]Unfortunately these two knuckleheads-
[215:10.42]Well it's 2-2 is it?
[215:11.98]Am I a no?
[215:12.98]Yeah these two Wait what are you doing?
[215:15.68]Is that a no?
[215:16.54]It's a no.
[215:17.00]Oh it's a no, okay.
[215:18.00]I'm so- number 10, I think you really have what it took.
[215:21.00]Oh well thank you very much-
[215:22.77]Give me a sad music one more time
[215:26.47]I thought you did too, but... Give me notes for me, Doctor.
[215:28.37]Yes.
[215:28.85]Doctor, any notes?
[215:29.99]Sir, I heard you wax poetic.
[215:34.40]I heard you talk from the heart.
[215:37.60]I heard intelligence of a new degree, so no way that you fucking hang by any... That's fair, thank you.
[215:44.76]I appreciate that, Doctor.
[215:46.58]Wait, wait, wait, number ten!

[216:14.53]I feel your pain.
[216:16.05]It's sad.
[216:16.95]Cry and make sure you put it on the screen that he's crying so we get extra ratings and stuff because people like when people cry on these shows.

[217:16.23]Surprised.
[217:17.15]Surprised?
[217:17.95]With the nunchucks?
[217:18.61]It hit the nuts?
[217:19.15]That was a great joke.
[217:20.21]I didn't think it was going to, you know, make the cut.
[217:23.63]Don't think so.
[217:24.43]No, no, but I'm pleasantly surprised.
[217:26.27]It was a good pre-planned joke, and I liked it a lot.
[217:29.56]And sometimes you've got to think fast on your feet.
[217:31.04]Do the pog face.
[217:32.28]Pog.
[217:33.54]What's a pog?
[217:35.55]He's got it!
[217:36.61]He's got it!
[217:37.05]He's got it!
[217:37.87]Don't even, are you serious?
[217:39.87]That's a pog face.
[217:41.13]He did it first try.
[217:42.49]He's like, no, he's doing this.
[217:43.75]He's going, he, that's literally it right there.
[217:46.39]That's it.
[217:46.75]That's it.
[217:47.63]That's it.
[217:48.19]Hold that.
[217:48.91]Hold that.
[217:50.21]You cannot buzz him.
[217:51.73]He took him five seconds.
[217:53.11]That was good.
[217:53.87]That was good.
[217:54.31]He took him five seconds to do it.
[217:56.61]Alright.
[217:56.93]Number 13.
[217:57.55]If you could do the Jerma craft coffee pasta, I would love to hear it.
[218:06.85]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[218:09.46]Welcome to the first episode of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[218:17.90]Now, this is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[218:22.57]But when I use that term, Let's Play, I use that term loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[218:29.95]Now, you're going to see lots of triumphs, lots of fails, even more triumphs.
[218:36.81]Well, at least I'm hoping so.
[218:38.76]So let's grab a nice hot cup of coffee, nice hot cup of cocoa.
[218:44.12]I got a nice hot cup of cider right here.
[218:49.84]It's invisible, but freshly brewed.
[218:53.80]Oh, that's good cider.
[218:58.25]I think coming in with a Christopher Walken is actually pretty brave.
[219:02.31]You dropped it halfway through.
[219:03.92]But seriously, if you come in with a Walken,
[219:07.69]It's going to be good.
[219:08.95]And that was a good walk-in.
[219:10.14]It certainly was great.
[219:11.36]Thank you, Jerma.
[219:14.26]If you do Jerma craft coffee pasta with a walk-in, wow, that's at least five or six extra points.
[219:20.46]We're off to a good start.
[219:21.78]Yes, we are.
[219:23.60]Can you do the cowbell routine, just to be sure?
[219:27.00]I'm ready to know you.
[219:29.10]Don't press the button.
[219:30.44]I got a fever.
[219:31.99]And the only prescription is more Jerma.
[219:35.59]Okay, don't.
[219:36.05]Gotta have it.
[219:37.19]Gotta have it.
[219:38.23]He's got a Christopher Walken.
[219:38.95]I put my pants on one leg at a time.
[219:41.25]Nobody bust this guy.
[219:42.01]The only difference is after I've got my pants on, I replace Jerma.
[219:47.14]Okay, he's got an absolutely phenomenal Walken.
[219:50.16]He's got a Walken.
[219:51.12]That's better than my Trump.
[219:52.22]That's better than my Bernie.
[219:53.52]That's better than my Walken.
[219:54.62]Is that J.R.R.
[219:55.55]Walken?
[219:56.13]Oh, that's phenomenal.
[219:57.95]Number 13, I don't...
[220:00.42]Really?
[220:01.17]You can't please everybody.
[220:03.55]Can't please everyone.
[220:06.83]He said himself.
[220:09.13]Don't!
[220:09.51]No!
[220:10.19]I'm kidding.
[220:10.67]What are you talking about?
[220:12.63]I'm good.
[220:13.03]I'm happy.
[220:13.43]I took it back.
[220:13.97]I took it back.
[220:14.55]It was the moment.
[220:15.23]That was 13.
[220:16.13]You've made it to the final three.
[220:19.32]That is the final three we have.
[220:20.80]That's a great celebration.
[220:22.44]I'm sorry.
[220:23.32]I take it back.
[220:23.94]That's such a great celebration.
[220:25.92]Jogging place.
[220:26.68]Thank you very much.
[220:27.32]We do have our final three, don't we?
[220:29.40]I think we have our actual final three.
[220:31.13]Alright.
[220:32.07]I love to hear that.
[220:33.67]So we're going to take one final break.
[220:37.05]And then guess what?
[220:39.09]You decide on who replaces me on Jerma985.

[229:05.54]Hello, 1, 9, and 13.

[229:09.18]Good, great.

[229:19.77]Still shaking.
[229:20.45]Good, good.
[229:21.13]Shaking, shaking.
[229:22.72]Well, unfortunately, the judges here now no longer have a say.
[229:27.08]Because it's now your say.
[229:29.97]They don't have a mic, but that's okay.
[229:32.59]Everybody in the chat right now, there will be a poll to decide of these three.
[229:39.57]1, 9, and 13.
[229:42.91]Who takes the Jerma985 moniker?
[229:46.51]There will be a poll in chat.
[229:47.94]It's for you to decide.
[229:50.38]You get the final decision.
[229:52.94]1, 9, or 13.
[229:54.40]We look forward to the poll.
[229:57.03]Maybe give some pizzazz at the end, you know?
[230:00.23]Show them why you deserve it.

[230:15.38]I love JoJo!
[230:21.22]We've got a very, this is ridiculous.
[230:23.32]Okay, come on.
[230:24.12]What's the poll at right now?
[230:24.86]It's between one percentage point, Jeremy.
[230:26.38]I'm looking at the stats right now.
[230:27.50]It's one percentage point.
[230:28.87]It's narrow.
[230:30.79]One vote could take this.
[230:32.39]One vote is deciding who wins.
[230:34.65]Number nine, can you step forward one?
[230:36.97]Move back now.
[230:37.75]Thank you.
[230:38.71]Number one, step forward two.
[230:40.77]Step left three.
[230:42.71]Step right three.

[230:44.93]Real smooth.
[230:45.75]Step back and step back, okay?
[230:49.21]What do we got right now for the poll?
[230:50.40]Let's say it.
[230:53.13]This is your Jerma985.
[230:55.98]You are deciding right now.
[231:02.64]1, 9, or 13.
[231:04.55]Future one of the biggest channels on all of Twitch.
