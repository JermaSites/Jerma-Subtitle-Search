[06:17.94]Nine months in a row is like... Wait, what?
[06:21.36]Is two months.
[06:21.90]If you play Pokémon Go, I want to make a Pokémon Go video.
[06:25.59]It's going to be very, very odd.
[06:27.39]But that means I have to make a video.
[06:29.49]And I have like the video curse on me right now.
[06:33.21]I'm of course working on a huge project, but I'm cursed.
[06:37.75]Every time I sit down to try to make a video...
[06:40.39]Like, just one that's not this big one.
[06:43.03]I have, like, an update video that I've been trying to get fucking done.
[06:47.15]And I keep just, like, going to eat something.
[06:49.49]And, like, I don't come back and fix it.
[06:51.01]I don't come back and finish it.
[06:54.69]I'm fucking... I'm cursed.
[06:57.23]I went... You know what?
[06:57.95]I should never have gone to that weird farmer's market to get, like, the weird, like, foods and fucking fruits and shit that I get.
[07:04.37]Because I remember I got in an argument with one of the ladies behind the counter.
[07:08.41]I was buying these weird half-avocado, half-star fruits, and the woman behind the counter was... I thought the prices were a little too high.
[07:15.87]Wait, what?
[07:16.95]So I just told her, I was like, look, your prices are too high.
[07:19.58]An avocado fruit should never be more than $1.50 per pound.
[07:25.48]And she put her hand in the air.
[07:27.50]And I was like, oh, hi-five, and I, like, hi-fived her, and she got really offended by it.
[07:31.08]Wait, what?
[07:33.39]And then she started, like, moving her fingers around and started, like, saying language I didn't know what it was.
[07:37.19]And, uh, I think, I think I've been cursed.
[07:39.17]But we got two, oh, wow, Ronnie.
[07:42.01]Had your baby prematurely, oh boy.
[07:44.13]Well, next month you'll do it.
[07:44.95]Womp Ronnie, what, womp Ronnie, what the hell am I doing?
[07:49.18]Womp Ronnie for eight months and then, oh, we got another fucking sub-baby, damn.
[07:53.26]Damn.
[07:55.27]Kenos is back for nine months.
[07:57.31]You guys, thank you.
[08:00.66]Thank you so much.
[08:02.78]All you guys, this is like, this is, I mean, the support tonight is just fucking crazy.
[08:08.72]Okay, I've delayed long enough.
[08:10.84]We can play the game.
[08:14.18]And Paco Taco for two months.
[08:15.91]Wait, what?
[08:16.77]I can't, we got, I'm like, okay, I'm in the hospital right now, and I'm getting texts that the babies are coming out, and I'm running from different hospital room to different hospital room.
[08:26.97]Like, okay, I was just holding Kenos' back's hand, and the baby came out, and I was like, oh, he's so beautiful.
[08:33.81]Oh, I'll be right back.
[08:35.67]Like fucking El Pepperoni's having a baby in the room over.
[08:38.23]And I'm like, just talk about it a second.
[08:39.29]I've got another baby in this room.
[08:40.61]And I don't tell Kenos' back, by the way.
[08:43.76]I'm, like, going, like, El Pepperoni's having a baby two rooms down.
[08:49.64]Whoa.
[08:49.84]I'm, like, falling.
[08:51.22]This is crazy.
[08:55.92]This jumping around shit is awesome.
[09:00.28]Is it, like, a sprint button?
[09:04.48]Holy shit.
[09:05.54]That would hurt.
[09:09.15]God, I sprayed my ankle.
[09:12.17]But thank you, El Pepperoni, for nine months.
[09:15.39]Let's just go.
[09:15.91]I'm in a forest.
[09:16.59]That's all I know.
[09:18.31]I can walk.
[09:18.85]Do you remember you're pretty average?
[09:23.89]I... Borg?
[09:25.55]Borg, I'd rather be average than below average.
[09:28.67]And if you're above average, guess what?
[09:30.37]People have expectations of you.
[09:32.61]I'm right in that sweet spot when nobody has any expectations.
[09:39.22]I'm dancing on the log.
[09:43.22]This would be, like, pretty impressive if I was at, like, a wedding on the dance floor.
[09:47.38]Or, like, I'm being surrounded by bees.
[09:50.51]Oh, shit, there's bees everywhere!
[09:51.57]What the fuck?
[09:52.17]Oh, fucking bees!
[09:52.93]Who hit the wasp nest with a baseball bat?
[09:55.23]Alright, no more jokes.
[09:55.85]Let's go.
[09:59.79]Ow.
[10:07.22]This is, like, a pretty... This is a very pretty game.
[10:09.72]You know what it reminds me of?
[10:12.35]This reminds me of another world.
[10:14.95]Just the way that, like, everything looks.
[10:16.41]And the way it feels when you move around and look at stuff.
[10:19.45]Ooh.
[10:20.31]Jesus.
[10:22.19]What's that?
[10:23.47]It's a truck with people in it?
[10:25.67]Another baby.
[10:27.87]This is fucking cool.
[10:29.89]Stormflare01, thank you for nine months.
[10:31.71]And there's another child.
[10:32.55]I ran to another room.
[10:35.23]Do I chase after that?
[10:36.75]Just kind of let it, kind of see what it is.
[10:41.53]Wait, what?
[10:44.43]And then heretic anchorite for five months.
[10:47.47]Thank you, dude.
[10:48.17]You're almost at it.
[10:49.03]You're getting close to it, baby.
[10:59.25]Oh, shit.
[11:01.17]What are these guys wearing masks?
[11:04.89]Oh, no.
[11:05.19]This is like the evil corporation that's trying to capture me or something, right?
[11:09.77]Wait, what?
[11:12.15]Tinkle surprise for five months.
[11:14.25]I'm assuming I don't want to be seen by these guys.
[11:15.75]Thank you, Tinkle.
[11:22.37]I don't want to be seen.
[11:24.84]Oh my god, there's so many resubs.
[11:26.90]I'm fucking... This is insane.
[11:29.08]Jiggle it a little, it'll open?
[11:30.72]What does that mean?
[11:31.38]Eight months.
[11:33.16]An eight month or... Oh, what's in the fridge?
[11:35.16]Can I open it?
[11:38.95]Oh, mom is gonna be pissed.
[11:43.20]What the hell were you doing in there?
[11:45.28]No, you don't understand, Mom.
[11:46.16]I had to tip the fridge over.
[11:49.32]I thought there was a rat underneath.
[11:50.56]I thought it was a long fall.
[11:56.13]I got a dog.
[11:57.43]Wait, what?
[11:58.91]Diver comes up.
[11:59.87]Mr. Kool-Aid, thank you for nine months.
[12:02.01]Go, go, go, go, go.
[12:04.77]I love the jump.
[12:05.49]It's so fun.
[12:08.13]Oh, Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy believes in you, Gemma.
[12:11.19]That's good.
[12:12.43]This is a... Look at this fall.
[12:15.67]I'm just gonna go for it.
[12:20.05]That's like a broken shinbone, if I've ever seen one.
[12:26.46]I'm just gonna drag this, I mean, right?
[12:29.04]Oh, shit, it's a little too heavy.
[12:34.54]Can that... That probably could crush you.
[12:42.00]Okay.
[12:43.16]Nice.
[12:47.47]This is very, very pretty.
[12:52.41]Should I wait?
[12:53.47]Can they see me?
[12:54.85]I feel like that guy can see me right now.
[12:58.76]Oh, fuck.
[12:59.28]Yeah, they can.
[13:00.06]This dog is right here.
[13:02.32]Oh, God.
[13:03.68]Am I faster than the dog?
[13:05.10]Holy shit!
[13:10.09]Jeez.
[13:11.25]Am I up or down?
[13:12.11]I guess down.
[13:17.65]Do I go down?
[13:18.55]No.
[13:21.02]Okay, I need to go up.
[13:22.98]That looks like an abyss.
[13:29.92]Damn, that was cool.
[13:33.53]Pet him?
[13:34.43]I would, if it was allowed.
[13:39.42]I'm in the jungle.
[13:42.72]Is that Otto?
[13:43.46]No, Otto wouldn't be that mean.
[13:45.26]He wouldn't bark at me and try to bite me.
[13:52.46]Water the dog.
[13:53.66]Is that me breathing, or is that something else breathing?
[14:05.04]I like how I'm just kind of walking with my... just holding right on the stick.
[14:11.06]Oh god.
[14:13.23]Oh god.
[14:18.57]They shoot a gun?!
[14:25.03]What?
[14:27.59]Should I let the car just drive by?
[14:28.65]What did they shoot me with?
[14:30.97]That was like a Jim Carrey dart.
[14:34.13]Am I gonna finish this game on stream?
[14:35.45]I'm gonna try.
[14:35.95]I don't understand.
[14:41.58]Okay, the car's gonna come.
[14:42.38]Now I'm gonna just hide here.
[14:44.18]It's gonna drive by, right?
[14:45.36]No.
[14:48.44]No, I just... I have to run.
[14:51.16]Is there, like, a tree I can hide behind?
[14:52.57]Or should I jump and then hide?
[14:53.73]I'm gonna jump... Yeah, I'm gonna go down here, right in this little cubby.
[15:00.05]Yeah, fuck you, buddy.
[15:06.34]This is really weird.
[15:07.84]Wait!
[15:08.52]What?! !
[15:09.92]I am Yiff.
[15:10.72]Thank you for two months.
[15:12.52]Welcome back.
[15:15.80]Every time.
[15:16.88]Okay, there's another car.
[15:18.48]Another car coming.
[15:20.94]Oh, yeah.
[15:21.24]By the way, I don't want to know any... No back seating.
[15:23.82]I don't want to have to turn on sub only mode.
[15:25.77]So don't tell me any spooks or any goofs or any secrets.
[15:28.85]Should I just go buy it?
[15:40.74]I don't know.
[15:41.08]I can't tell if I should just walk by this or not.
[15:43.18]Okay, I'm just gonna try it.
[15:43.92]I'm just gonna walk by it.
[15:44.74]I'm gonna creep by.
[15:48.38]Ooh!
[15:48.98]Ooh!
[15:49.58]Ooh!
[15:50.98]Ooh, guy!
[15:51.87]Can I punch him?
[15:59.61]Okay, that was fucking... That was pretty fucked up.
[16:02.59]I'm just gonna run.
[16:05.14]Oh, shit!
[16:11.96]I tripped over a log.
[16:15.59]Thank you, Moe9.
[16:18.39]Thank you for two months, dude.
[16:22.29]I'm like looking at the chat.
[16:25.95]I'm looking at the fucking chat.
[16:27.23]I tripped over a log again.
[16:28.49]Alright, let's go.
[16:36.74]This is like a horse race.
[16:39.50]Get in the Winnebago quick.
[16:46.12]Oh shit, that guy has a gun!
[16:49.94]That guy's got a gun!
[16:55.28]Get the fuck away from me!
[16:58.17]This is freaking me out.
[16:59.85]There's dogs... There's hounds chasing me.
[17:02.79]Oh god, they're gonna get me!
[17:06.09]Am I underwater?
[17:13.29]Is there like any special secrets?
[17:15.45]There's definitely like a secret back here.
[17:16.96]You know there is.
[17:17.44]Why can't I move?
[17:44.73]Okay, underwater.
[17:47.57]Keep going.
[17:51.88]Going to bed claiming?
[17:52.70]Well, thank you for four months, dude.
[17:56.16]Put your head up.
[17:57.02]Okay, go back down.
[18:01.50]I mean, I understand the concept of drowning, but usually it takes a little bit longer in games.
[18:04.58]This is a very realistic game.
[18:11.06]People need air.
[18:11.84]Yeah, but in video games you get, like, the air bar.
[18:13.96]You know, like, the air bar is in the middle of the screen.
[18:17.04]And it takes, like, four minutes to go down.
[18:18.78]There's, like, dead animals here.
[18:22.55]Jesus.
[18:27.77]How are you responsible for all these babies when you can't handle one child?
[18:31.43]That's true.
[18:31.91]This is very impressive so far, visually, I will say.
[18:41.05]Wait, what?
[18:43.25]And then J.S.
[18:44.87]Swish.
[18:45.91]This is my voice.
[18:46.71]Did you hear that?
[18:47.25]That old fucking man.
[18:49.15]J.S.
[18:49.71]Swish.
[18:50.45]Thank you, J.S.
[18:51.35]Swish.
[18:52.27]For five months.
[18:52.89]Appreciate it, dude.
[18:57.37]Need to wear the diaper?
[18:58.33]I'm not wearing the diaper.
[19:00.65]I didn't have to.
[19:03.19]Tell him, MVP Panda.
[19:05.15]MVP Panda.
[19:06.21]Two months in a row.
[19:07.29]With a heart.
[19:08.23]Tell him I'm not going to wear a diaper.
[19:10.93]Wait, what?
[19:12.96]ChiliRose13, nine months, we got another sub, baby.
[19:16.18]Let's just go to another hospital room and just start looking around for where the kid is.
[19:21.64]Thank you, ChiliRose, it's a long time.
[19:25.60]The lighting is awesome, too.
[19:27.77]Those little chickens?
[19:29.69]Oh, look at these little chickens.
[19:32.87]That's awesome.
[19:33.99]Where's their mother?
[19:35.07]Alright, let's go.
[19:36.39]Look at the Pied Piper.
[19:40.92]Are these chickies?
[19:41.54]Yeah, they look like baby chickies.
[19:43.88]Come on, little baby chickies.
[19:46.76]I should just press X to throw grain on the ground.
[19:49.52]Watch out, I don't want to step on anybody.
[19:56.52]There's a lot of chickens.
[20:00.56]What happens if I just stand still?
[20:02.48]You can die a bunch of ways in this game.
[20:04.00]Are they going to peck me to death?
[20:10.70]Oh, what a chick magnet.
[20:12.02]I saw that.
[20:12.52]Are they turtles?
[20:15.24]They're not turtles.
[20:18.80]Do I have to grab the door and pull it?
[20:20.14]I'm in.
[20:23.07]Man, there's chickens after me.
[20:24.01]Do I have to kick the door down?
[20:31.19]Whoa.
[20:31.85]We're moving.
[20:34.78]I'm slamming into the door.
[20:36.10]Dude, that would knock the wind out of you so hard.
[20:44.10]I can climb the rope.
[20:45.00]Alright, I'm just curious.
[20:48.04]I just need to know.
[20:48.78]I have to know it, guys.
[20:55.83]No way.
[20:57.01]No way.
[20:57.55]Unrealistic.
[20:58.41]Immersion broken.
[21:00.19]I would break all the bones in my body.
[21:06.66]Face reveal if you open the door.
[21:12.76]There's a big lever down there.
[21:14.00]I'm assuming I have to pull it.
[21:16.32]Ow!
[21:17.04]That was a harder drop than the other one.
[21:19.27]Let me look at this room.
[21:20.11]Let me investigate here.
[21:23.05]There's a thing I can pull here.
[21:24.11]There's a big lawnmower in the middle.
[21:28.89]Take a quick shower.
[21:30.44]Rinse all that dirt off me and that gross salt water.
[21:34.20]Okay, that's done.
[21:35.18]Let's go.
[21:38.97]We're going to just do this.
[21:40.06]Okay, obviously I need to pull this.
[21:42.86]This is probably the gas.
[21:44.96]Pull the gas.
[21:45.58]Alright, I pulled it a bunch of times, Dad.
[21:54.07]Do I get to help you work in the shop?
[22:00.25]Come on.
[22:01.03]Come on.
[22:02.07]Get it rolling.
[22:03.18]Alright.
[22:04.38]Now we can turn this on.
[22:07.15]There we go.
[22:07.75]I'm not sure what this is supposed to be doing.
[22:12.47]I don't know, I don't understand what that needs to do.
[22:16.46]I'm shooting.
[22:18.88]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[22:20.94]I can open this door now.
[22:29.52]Am I gonna feed all these chickens to the wood chipper?
[22:31.51]Hold on, is there like a fucking rock or something I can grab?
[22:39.19]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[22:42.25]I definitely can, like, put, like, a fucking rock in there.
[22:51.40]Put the chicks in the machine.
[22:52.54]No, there's nothing over here.
[22:53.38]I'm going all the way back for no reason.
[22:58.36]Get it going, get it going, get it going good.
[23:03.31]Thank you, Weasel, for two months.
[23:07.91]Appreciate it, dude.
[23:08.63]Welcome back.
[23:10.45]Oh, it is the chickens.
[23:12.23]This is against everything I believe in.
[23:14.07]I'm an animal liker.
[23:16.67]I have to jump in the machine?
[23:24.47]I obviously have to do something with this.
[23:30.40]It has to blow the hay thing off.
[23:31.80]Why isn't it blowing the haystack off?
[23:33.86]Can I turn this somehow?
[23:41.82]Here they come.
[23:43.48]Alright, guys.
[23:44.30]Tell me what I should do.
[23:45.28]Alright, get in.
[23:48.88]Get in this thing.
[23:53.65]Hello.
[23:54.03]Oh, leather jacket.
[23:54.79]Nine months.
[23:55.29]Thanks a lot, dude.
[23:58.41]I have to, like, suck something up, don't I?
[24:02.42]Welcome back.
[24:02.94]Thank you for your sub, baby.
[24:06.18]They're not gonna go in there, are they?
[24:07.28]No.
[24:10.02]I need to turn it.
[24:10.92]How do I turn the machine?
[24:14.48]I'm gonna have to jump.
[24:16.84]Hold on.
[24:19.00]That's what I did.
[24:19.74]I held it before.
[24:24.94]What are these chickens doing?
[24:31.32]I'm gonna hold it for another five seconds.
[24:41.24]Okay, I get it.
[24:44.22]Come here, you little chickens.
[24:45.48]This is going to be horrible, isn't it?
[24:47.85]Come here.
[24:52.79]This is not cool.
[24:53.73]I really don't want to do this.
[25:01.21]Oh my god!
[25:02.11]That's terrible.
[25:05.86]They're alive, it's okay.
[25:10.45]They seem to be quite happy about that whole experience, by the way.
[25:18.23]Well, I wish I could bring you with me, but I can't.
[25:21.03]Sorry, guys.
[25:21.61]That was just awful.
[25:31.22]I'm like FPS hopping right now.
[25:32.64]I need to cut that out.
[25:38.09]I think I'm about to do an Ubisoft jump into the pigs.
[25:42.31]Yeah.
[25:43.21]I am.
[25:55.13]Crushed up like an accordion.
[26:02.45]Can I hit my face on the lamp post?
[26:04.15]Let me get ready.

[27:22.61]Mud.
[27:22.79]Do I have any, like, cool shoes I can get?
[27:24.21]Where's, like, the character creator?
[27:25.63]Is this quicksand?
[27:30.64]This is very realistic mud.
[27:31.94]I get stuck in.
[27:37.00]Oh, that's so awesome.
[27:37.72]You get to do, like, the Spider-Man turn.
[27:40.52]Nice.
[27:44.04]Nice.
[27:49.38]Rats.
[27:49.64]Is this a horror game?
[27:51.50]No, it's like an atmospheric side-scrolling puzzle platformer with very awful things, apparently.
[27:58.24]This is... Ugh!
[27:59.44]Okay, that's a... What the...
[28:07.84]It's fucking awesome.
[28:17.29]It's too bad.
[28:18.91]It's too bad it didn't work out That's what you have to do How many times do I have to do this?
[28:38.17]Is he still alive?
[28:39.43]Oh, he's still here.
[28:40.29]Get out of here.
[28:43.31]Can I climb up the stairs?
[28:45.93]How long is this gonna happen for?
[28:48.59]Can I get rid of the fucking pig?
[28:52.65]This is becoming tiresome.
[28:58.07]I don't like this.
[29:03.00]I don't like this.
[29:04.56]Is this a Roadhog play?
[29:05.72]The game looks good.
[29:11.36]This is Roadhog playing the game.
[29:15.03]Oh, we just need that music to be playing there.
[29:16.61]Okay.
[29:19.21]Do I have to... I'm up on his body, obviously.
[29:22.23]That worm is fucking gross.
[29:27.01]Oh!

[30:05.71]Oh, this is the worst fucking thing I've ever seen.
[30:09.21]Oh, thank God.
[30:11.59]How do I fucking shoot that thing?
[30:14.51]Is he okay?
[30:17.10]Is it, we're like friends now.
[30:19.66]Oh, I can, at least I can pet him.
[30:21.82]It's okay.
[30:23.18]Everything's gonna be alright.
[30:24.10]I just pulled a worm out of your ass.
[30:27.27]Oh, I feel so much better now.
[30:28.47]I can, like, pet him.
[30:30.44]He's like, okay.
[30:31.54]Alright, let's go.
[30:32.18]Let's go this way.
[30:35.36]Oh, boy.
[30:37.36]What is it?
[30:37.84]Let me, like, let me just, like, rub his back a little bit.
[30:39.90]Just so he knows, like, I'm not, like, a threat and I, like, love him.
[30:42.28]There you go.
[30:44.36]What a good dog.
[30:45.28]Pick.
[30:45.50]I don't want to push him that hard.
[30:48.39]But, like, come back this way.
[30:49.81]We're just going to go this way a little bit.
[30:55.27]Okay, like, where do I have to bring him?
[30:57.14]Okay, just pet him again.
[31:01.16]Everything's okay.
[31:02.14]I'm just sorry.
[31:02.52]I'm sorry about this.
[31:03.48]You're a good pig.
[31:07.84]Oh, I see.
[31:08.23]I gotta grab that.
[31:08.97]Okay, yeah, everything's gonna be fine.
[31:10.99]You're a good, really good dog.
[31:11.99]Good pig.
[31:12.79]Good boy.
[31:13.19]What a good boy.
[31:13.93]Okay, this way.
[31:14.49]Come back this way.
[31:18.55]Right there.
[31:19.49]Right there.
[31:20.35]Now I'm gonna have to get on you.
[31:21.62]Is that okay?
[31:23.32]Okay, yeah.
[31:23.84]You're a good pig.
[31:25.38]You did me- You worked well.
[31:27.12]Good job.
[31:29.58]What's wrong with these people?
[31:33.22]What the fuck?
[31:38.53]Am I controlling these people's brains?
[31:47.65]Holy shit, okay.
[31:50.39]So... Ooh, that's okay.
[31:56.48]They gotta open this door.
[31:57.38]Now they all can move.
[32:01.50]Okay, one of them seems to be smarter than the other ones.
[32:09.94]They take a little longer.
[32:14.78]And then, probably want to forward or back?
[32:16.90]I'm assuming probably forward.
[32:18.94]No, back.
[32:24.42]Alright, good job, guys.
[32:29.20]Now, I have a strange feeling that they're going to... These guys are probably going to come.
[32:35.06]I'm locking them back in.
[32:35.86]Alright, I'll close the door.
[32:37.16]Lock yourselves back in.
[32:39.93]I feel like this guy's going to run after me.
[32:41.49]Did I bring the pig?
[32:43.23]Let's go, come on.
[32:44.43]I'm going to go this way.
[32:45.75]We're going to get you some food.
[32:46.56]We're going to get you some great dinner.
[32:48.94]We're going to get you all... What is it going to be so much good?
[32:50.62]Like pig slop?
[32:52.04]Wait a second.
[32:52.50]Get that fucking parasite out of here.
[32:55.66]I'm getting you away from that parasite.
[32:58.48]Oh.
[32:59.33]Well, you can't come with me, but... You did a good job.
[33:02.23]Bye, pig.
[33:09.05]Oh, I can't grab that.
[33:10.43]It's over here.
[33:15.74]Nothing.
[33:17.54]Brain-controlled zombies and worms.
[33:19.22]Yeah, this is fucking nuts.
[33:22.30]Gotta say, I did not expect the butt pig.
[33:28.70]Okay.
[33:34.67]It's starting to become a little brighter outside.
[33:36.03]I'm seeing colors.
[33:41.35]Look at that big building.
[33:43.15]Looks like a baseball stadium.
[33:46.35]Hit one out of Fenway Park.
[33:47.51]Get it onto Lansdowne Street.
[33:50.59]A green monster.
[33:53.70]Okay, watch out for these zombies, though.
[33:55.30]I have to control these people, too.
[34:06.37]I'm gonna assume I have to make those people do something weird.
[34:11.30]Uh, can I push this?
[34:12.00]Yeah.
[34:13.70]Wait, hold on.
[34:17.62]Let's do that first and just take a look up here.
[34:21.82]Oh, isn't the all-star game tonight?
[34:23.01]Or is it tonight or tomorrow?
[34:23.89]I don't know.
[34:24.61]It's one of these days.
[34:25.49]The next day.
[34:26.27]Okay, nice and easy.
[34:33.27]Make your way... Yeah, this really does remind me of another world.
[34:37.19]Out of this world, whatever that game was back like 20 years ago now.
[34:44.09]Open up some of the windows.
[34:44.91]Are those birds going to come in?
[34:49.30]I got a feeling... Your mom's an all-star game?
[34:53.68]Well, thanks, Nathan.
[34:55.74]I appreciate it.
[34:57.22]I don't think I should be doing this.
[34:58.66]Yeah, okay.
[34:59.26]I got to get the birds to follow me.
[35:01.12]This is like the animal game.
[35:04.32]They're going to land.
[35:05.02]I'm going to make them go that way.
[35:05.92]They'll go through the window.
[35:07.32]I got you.
[35:08.45]I wasn't born yesterday.
[35:11.59]I was born 22 years ago.
[35:13.94]I'm only 22, guys.
[35:18.52]I'm definitely not 30.
[35:19.50]That's like a rumor somebody made up online.
[35:26.01]It's a fucking rumor.
[35:31.88]What does this do?
[35:40.77]No, I gotta make it fit.
[35:41.81]Come down, come down, come down.
[35:45.69]It's gotta be like this so I can... What?
[35:49.66]What?
[35:51.02]What?
[35:54.06]What?
[35:56.46]I gotta break these fucking things.
[36:01.16]Shit.
[36:04.04]How the hell do I do that?
[36:06.58]Can I make that jump?
[36:09.58]I don't know.
[36:14.49]I definitely can if it was... If it was like this, I could do it.
[36:23.63]Let's see what that does.
[36:29.86]Ooh, got it.
[36:37.52]Okay, I can make the jump.
[36:43.25]Can I make it twice?
[36:45.37]I don't think so.
[36:45.93]Yeah, I can.
[36:53.15]Now what the fuck is the point of coming up here?
[36:56.17]Oh, you gotta drop the safe.
[36:59.97]On the... Oh, fuck!
[37:10.60]Okay.
[37:12.10]What is this, like, fucking Acme Looney Tunes game?
[37:25.48]Got it.
[37:25.68]I don't know what the hell I did, but I did it.
[37:30.90]I don't think I need to do that.
[37:38.97]Let's just, like, see what's over here.
[37:40.69]Okay.
[37:42.61]Ah, that's death.
[37:43.65]There's a hole there.
[37:46.41]There is a hole.
[37:46.91]Oh, no.
[37:47.07]Do I have to do this again?
[37:48.37]Let's see what was down there.
[37:52.93]Damn.
[37:56.19]So which way should I go?
[37:56.77]Should I try to jump down into the hole?
[38:00.15]I'm curious.
[38:00.93]Curiosity is going to kill the cat again.
[38:02.69]But we need to see what's down here.
[38:06.01]There's a fucking train.
[38:07.23]Okay.
[38:08.16]I got you.
[38:12.82]Just push the fucking wily coyote safe again.
[38:16.26]Watch out for the roadrunner.
[38:18.74]Go back down to the birds.
[38:22.65]I can drop from here.
[38:23.32]I'll be fine.
[38:30.12]That's gotta hurt.
[38:30.86]I know, really.
[38:33.72]So what did that actually do?
[38:38.27]Made a big hole.
[38:40.55]Should I go in it?
[38:41.07]I feel like I should go in it.
[38:45.15]Okay.
[38:48.79]There's a grate here.
[38:49.90]Rip the grate off.
[38:52.27]There's a button.
[38:53.55]Push the button.
[38:56.03]Wait.
[38:57.65]Let's take a look to the right.
[38:58.41]Make sure we didn't miss anything.
[39:01.81]This is where I fell.
[39:02.69]Another lever.
[39:06.35]One where I can control brains.
[39:12.57]Uh-huh.
[39:17.22]So, run this guy through?
[39:22.32]There's two of them.
[39:24.46]They're gonna, like, stand off.
[39:26.76]Oh, no, okay, okay, okay.
[39:28.46]I gotta make them both stand on the plate.
[39:35.50]Huh.
[39:36.04]Alright, how do I make... Get over here.
[39:37.37]I, like, didn't mean to fall off that.
[39:41.35]Can I, like, make them both be turned in the same direction?
[39:50.21]Come on, go!
[39:55.66]Alright, let's think about this.
[40:03.32]They can't collide with each other, so... Can I go the other direction?
[40:14.66]Oh, okay.
[40:15.02]Hold on.
[40:19.04]Now if I run this dude into the wall...
[40:25.50]I need to get him, yeah.
[40:26.90]So, you run into the wall.
[40:29.96]And then by the time... Yeah, by the time he gets all the way back here, they should step on both, right?
[40:36.79]Oh, are you smarter than a fifth grader?
[40:39.75]How do I get out?
[40:40.37]Get this off me.
[40:46.74]Another train room.
[40:56.10]Just wanna see what's up here.
[40:58.19]There's like the whole bird room over there.
[41:00.33]I didn't do anything with it.
[41:01.19]I should go back and look at it.
[41:02.37]I'm just curious.
[41:04.33]Curious.
[41:05.71]Curious.
[41:10.93]That's gonna break.
[41:15.96]Is this a game about how children manipulate adults?
[41:18.24]I'm not sure what it is.
[41:20.60]But we're gonna go for a fucking big slide!
[41:34.09]Alright, let me just look.
[41:36.13]I can grab the grate.
[41:37.77]I can grab the pole.
[41:38.63]Do you remember missing every secret?
[41:46.09]Well, that's where there's secrets.
[41:57.42]Ooh, sneaky.
[42:03.74]Yeah, it's called- It's a secret because you know the secret and I don't know- See, I'm like fucking- See, I'm like arguing and I'm getting in fucking trouble.
[42:17.00]This is like a fucking child parkour game.
[42:31.03]This is fucked up.
[42:40.41]I love how I'm looking over it.
[42:41.27]That's, like, we're talking about small, nuanced things that I really like.
[42:45.85]I'm, like, looking over at these people.
[42:47.39]That's really, really cool.
[42:48.27]Just like, what the hell is going on over there?
[42:53.74]Damn.
[42:55.66]Keep ripping it off.
[42:58.58]What again?
[42:59.84]Rip it like a fucking broken tooth.
[43:12.15]Ow.
[43:12.31]Let's climb up.
[43:22.25]Hold on.
[43:23.07]Ooh, ow.
[43:24.74]Can I pull the ladder?
[43:25.52]I mean, can I do like a fucking earnest commercial where I fall off the ladder?
[43:34.62]Probably can.
[43:35.10]Yeah.
[43:43.17]If you don't know what I'm talking about, go look up, like, Ernest TV commercials.
[43:46.17]He does, like, 10 where he falls off a fucking ladder on somebody's house.
[43:50.55]Whoa.
[43:50.69]Oh, there's a dead person in here.
[43:57.69]Alright, let me make sure... Hold on a second.
[43:58.95]I don't want to miss any secrets!
[44:02.77]Oh, there's no secrets down there.
[44:03.85]Good catch.
[44:08.27]I'm just kidding, guys.
[44:09.54]I'm just kidding.
[44:10.40]Let's turn on the giant fucking alien robot.
[44:16.65]Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[44:21.90]Here, go take my picture.
[44:23.04]It's picture day.
[44:35.87]Nope.
[44:40.89]Stay behind the pillar.
[44:41.63]He can't see you.
[44:44.97]Ah, I've played Metal Gear Solid 2 before.
[44:47.19]I know the secret.
[44:48.03]Don't act like I've never played Metal Gear Solid 2.
[44:52.48]Get in!
[45:02.16]Fuck.
[45:02.34]God.
[45:02.72]Hold on.
[45:03.26]Wait.
[45:03.42]Don't even turn it on.
[45:05.52]Lift the gate up first, and then go turn it on.
[45:12.89]You know what I mean?
[45:19.19]That's as easy as that.
[45:20.43]And then you go.
[45:20.95]And then you turn on the robs and they shoot you with the fucking silly string.
[45:29.61]Taser gun.
[45:32.39]Just please, guys, don't act like I've never played Metal Gear Solid, okay?
[45:36.81]I'm like holding X like it's a sprint button.
[45:43.30]There's no sprint button.
[45:45.82]And then press it.
[45:46.40]Let's go.
[45:48.46]See ya.
[45:52.29]Jump!
[45:53.49]What a jump!
[45:54.59]You can't strip me through the glass!
[46:00.99]0% of people who have not played Metal Gear Solid 2 have completed this section of the game.
[46:05.18]Another animal friend.
[46:12.06]Is that like a fucking ration?
[46:13.14]What is that?
[46:17.72]Let's do things not to do 101.
[46:26.38]Really?
[46:26.74]Come on.
[46:28.22]This would break.
[46:28.94]Let's get the weaker part of the wood.
[46:35.59]Really?
[46:35.87]I don't know.
[46:39.05]You don't get to see the funny joke.
[46:47.32]Pull up!
[46:47.82]Pull up!
[46:53.63]Uh-oh, he can tell I still have my brain.
[46:57.29]Just don't move.
[46:59.31]Yeah, I know what it wants me to do.
[47:02.47]It wants me to pretend to be one.
[47:03.97]It's red light, green light.
[47:07.19]It's a torturous, awful version of red light, green light!
[47:13.13]Fuck this, I'm out of here!
[47:14.41]Get out!
[47:20.93]Oh, sorry, that was the wrong way.
[47:23.10]I can't, like, pretend to be the... Okay, let's go.
[47:29.00]One, two, three, four.
[47:33.04]One, two, three, four, one.
[47:35.56]I was just kidding.
[47:39.08]One, two, three, four.
[47:41.12]One, two, three, four, one.
[47:45.42]Why is it just staring at me?
[47:46.42]Aren't there other people here to look at?
[47:54.53]You'd think that this machine would, at this point, have figured out that I'm one of them.
[47:59.05]One of them.
[48:03.79]Okay, so look at that.
[48:04.78]They're jumping.
[48:06.84]I gotta do that too.
[48:08.14]So I gotta get right there and then jump.
[48:09.26]Why'd that guy jump?
[48:11.86]Okay.
[48:14.14]Am I gonna have to jump?
[48:15.60]What if I don't jump?
[48:24.33]Where are they taking us?
[48:28.25]Oh, I did it early!
[48:28.99]I did it early, it's okay.
[48:32.85]Do I have to do it again?
[48:33.43]No, I'm outside the line, I'm okay.
[48:37.28]So then I have to turn around.
[48:42.30]I'm so obviously not one.
[48:48.39]Okay, so this is quick turnaround.
[48:58.51]They're like practicing to paint a Michael Jackson video.
[49:05.01]What?
[49:05.33]What?
[49:05.75]What?
[49:07.09]Okay, I thought it was going to shoot me.
[49:13.23]Don't look!
[49:13.63]Don't look!
[49:13.93]What is he looking?
[49:14.31]He's looking.
[49:14.73]Don't look.
[49:15.13]Can I go now?
[49:25.25]No, I can't.
[49:25.69]There's like people watching.
[49:29.23]I hope I don't die.
[49:29.79]I really don't want to do this section over again.
[49:36.55]Somebody's puking.
[49:37.09]Who's puking?
[49:37.97]Listen to me, son.
[49:40.47]I'm your dad.
[49:42.89]Destroy him!
[49:45.20]Oh, shit.
[49:45.66]He's barking.
[49:46.88]What?
[49:48.18]StokedGamer, thank you for your subscription.
[49:52.66]What's going on?
[49:53.68]What's going on?
[49:56.49]I'm running!
[49:56.91]I'm running!
[49:57.19]I can do it!
[50:01.97]Oh!
[50:06.27]Fuck!
[50:12.15]Should I start running now?
[50:13.81]Try to catch him off guard?
[50:14.61]I don't know.
[50:20.27]Okay, go now!
[50:20.85]Go now!
[50:21.17]Go!
[50:21.45]Go!
[50:21.81]Stop walking and run!
[50:31.83]This poor kid has gone through hell.
[50:36.92]Oh shit, it's going to cut me off.
[50:45.04]Come on, come on.
[50:46.94]Idiot.
[50:48.20]We're going to go all the way around.
[50:51.93]Ooh, somebody got control of the device.
[50:54.86]Get me out of here.
[51:03.58]You've been hit by, you've been struck by.
[51:06.28]And then we had Croacher resubscribe for four months.
[51:09.15]Thank you, Croacher.
[51:10.11]Welcome back, dude.
[51:12.31]Look at this kid.
[51:15.25]He's playing a little DS.
[51:20.33]Okay, so should I move this anywhere?
[51:23.23]Oh, check for secrets.
[51:25.27]Is there a secret down here?
[51:30.52]Nope.
[51:36.81]Look at the kid.
[51:40.59]He's doing this marching band imitation.
[51:49.25]Get off.
[51:49.91]Get it off me.
[51:52.30]Get this fucking stupid thing off my head.
[51:54.26]Okay.
[52:00.22]Oh, no.
[52:01.12]I lost my... Huh.
[52:04.51]Okay.
[52:08.89]Huh.
[52:09.95]Well... Well...
[52:18.50]This is a predicament.
[52:24.94]This is a predicament.
[52:36.97]You get down there.
[52:39.01]Right?
[52:39.25]Hold on.
[52:39.53]Let me, like, see.
[52:40.97]If he's over there, can he, like, stand on it?
[52:46.10]I think I just have to get him through it.
[52:47.34]Do I?
[52:47.66]I have no idea.
[52:48.49]Where the hell is he going to go?
[52:50.95]Is there anything on the other side of that?
[53:01.23]Border 30.
[53:07.51]Thank you.
[53:08.29]Welcome back, dude.
[53:11.79]I can go over here.
[53:12.39]I can put it over there.
[53:13.91]I get it.
[53:14.45]I can see it now.
[53:20.08]We have to kill another pig.
[53:21.60]Thank you, Mortar30, for your subscription.
[53:23.98]If people are really freaking out this much, it took me like fucking five seconds to figure this out.
[53:30.60]Everybody just fucking calm down.
[53:32.70]Seriously.
[53:33.20]I'm gonna do it.
[53:36.02]You want me to do it?
[53:36.90]I'll do it.
[53:38.72]If I see any more backseating in this chat, I'll do it.
[53:41.13]Okay?
[53:43.73]Just saw it.
[53:44.49]Just saw it.
[53:47.05]Yeah, he's dead.
[53:47.77]How's that?
[53:48.31]Secret check.
[53:56.14]I like that.
[53:56.72]I'll do it.
[54:00.04]Do it.
[54:00.68]Do it.
[54:08.59]I mean, I don't care if people like, you know, say I'm an idiot.
[54:12.91]But that was like less than a minute and ten seconds.
[54:16.62]Come on, man, let me like take the game in.
[54:19.02]Let me take the fucking atmosphere in.
[54:20.46]There's a guy, there's a fucking Farmer Joe up there in overalls whose brain I'm controlling.
[54:24.68]I'm more worried about that.
[54:31.22]You're not gonna do it.
[54:35.84]Hey Ragglefrack, thank you for the four months welcome back, dude.
[54:39.33]Alright, can I connect his head to it?
[54:45.47]I think I can.
[54:47.32]Oh man, this is like, I'm like warging into him.
[54:50.10]I feel like doing a double warg here.
[54:55.44]Dude, this is some fucking weird triple warg.
[55:05.22]Okay, I got like two wargs now.
[55:06.72]Now I can get like him down.
[55:07.74]How do I get just him down?
[55:09.96]How do I take the warg off his warg?
[55:16.25]Get off.
[55:17.56]Okay.
[55:18.36]Wow, I almost just killed myself.
[55:28.47]Sarah, I can't allow it.
[55:30.07]I shouldn't have talked about secrets.
[55:31.49]I don't care.
[55:33.11]Should I just drop myself on the cement?
[55:43.42]I get a feeling that's what it wants me to do.
[55:47.91]Is it water or is it going to kill me?
[55:50.66]What are they doing?
[55:51.28]They're like freaking out.
[55:52.00]Where is this?
[55:52.64]That guy knocked all the... Oh shit, somebody just opened up the fucking thing.
[55:56.54]Okay, I got to put it like over on the left.
[56:04.41]So we keep it right here, right there.
[56:08.61]He goes over.
[56:10.16]This guy freaks out and knocks all this shit off his desk.
[56:16.59]And there we are.
[56:18.93]Don't drown in here.
[56:31.60]Unusual call box.
[56:32.86]Thank you for your subscription.
[56:34.20]Welcome to the channel.
[56:35.90]We're going to take a look over here and see what's over this way.
[56:40.28]Welcome to the channel.
[56:42.04]You might have been here for a while, but welcome to the subscriber club.
[56:48.33]Alright, we're gonna do a deep dive here.
[56:49.73]I hope it doesn't kill me.
[56:51.31]Deep dive.
[56:53.51]What's that?
[56:54.37]Deep dive.
[56:57.33]Got it!
[56:59.30]Don't die!
[57:02.54]Okay.
[57:04.24]Can I push this?
[57:04.86]Can I move this?
[57:09.14]How much oxygen do I have?
[57:10.04]I don't really know.
[57:11.02]Is there more of those?
[57:11.68]I feel like there's a couple more of those logs.
[57:13.26]Logs.
[57:14.87]Logs.
[57:15.25]Don't go down that deep!
[57:16.13]Don't go down...
[57:22.42]It's going to push it over the edge.
[57:23.44]You got it.
[57:25.02]Secret check.
[57:27.20]Found a secret.
[57:29.00]Turn on the electricity.
[57:31.40]No, that would fucking murder me.
[57:39.51]Push it.
[57:41.29]I missed a secret.
[57:42.81]It's going to happen for the rest of the time I play.
[57:50.51]Not a spoiler, just noticing a funny thing.
[57:54.77]It's so funny.
[57:56.45]I look over at the chat.
[57:57.49]I try to keep tabs on it as much as I can.
[58:00.18]And just seeing the one guy with the FailFish.
[58:03.96]He's just like, how could you fucking miss that shit?
[58:08.24]God.
[58:10.21]Dumbass.
[58:11.69]And he's probably right.
[58:12.85]It's true.
[58:13.17]I probably missed something cool.
[58:15.75]Didn't miss the big button, though.
[58:19.68]I drained the water.
[58:20.82]Nice.
[58:21.14]I can... Wait.
[58:23.62]Hold the hand on it?
[58:30.99]IKH1, thank you for five months.
[58:32.53]Welcome back to... Go.
[58:35.47]Before the water... Before the water comes back.
[58:37.13]Whoa, wait a second.
[58:42.36]Did I want to do that?
[58:42.98]Maybe I did.
[58:47.66]Can I hold it underwater?
[58:49.06]No, I just gotta let it come up.
[58:52.26]Hold on, hold on a second.
[58:53.25]Secret check.
[58:54.21]Secret check over here.
[58:56.69]I see, yeah.
[58:57.67]He knew about this one.
[58:58.63]He knew there was a secret over this way.
[59:02.55]See, guys?
[59:04.19]He's not all brawn.
[59:06.37]He's some brains.
[59:08.27]He probably should get off of it.
[59:10.27]He probably should get off the thing you're trying to open.
[59:12.55]He's not all brawn.
[59:15.18]Fuck.
[59:16.68]That wasn't a secret at all.
[59:26.61]Maybe I need that for later.
[59:34.03]Well... Literally only brawn.
[59:42.75]Alright, that door opens.
[59:43.53]If I can grab this fucking chain.
[59:45.87]Right?
[59:46.31]Can I?
[59:49.07]Let's take a look.
[59:49.77]You aren't even brawn.
[59:50.89]Yes, I am.
[59:54.19]You didn't even see that.
[59:54.81]I was flexing so hard, though.
[59:56.15]Alright, well, obviously... Obviously... PizzaPepper69, subscribe.
[60:07.26]Let's try, like, doing it backwards.
[60:16.44]What happens now?
[60:18.18]Is it going to open?
[60:23.46]No.
[60:24.04]Yes, it is.
[60:25.98]And then up the... Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[60:30.64]Hold on a second.
[60:32.43]Pates of Pepper 69.
[60:33.45]I think I may have just figured it out.
[60:39.55]So I have to put it down.
[60:40.61]I'm going to get a...
[60:46.69]When water comes down, I have to come back down in this room.
[60:50.05]Through my secret passage.
[60:51.33]The secret that I opened.
[60:52.41]Let me make sure there's nothing else down here.
[60:59.12]Wait a minute.
[60:59.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[61:00.60]Bad, bad.
[61:03.64]When the water's down, that door's open.
[61:06.92]Below average.
[61:07.84]Brain sucks.
[61:09.79]Alright.
[61:10.91]Okay.
[61:12.51]Settle down.
[61:13.91]Settle down.
[61:17.69]It's like, tag, you're it.
[61:18.59]Nah, see, okay, I got the secret tunnel open.
[61:23.91]I'm down here.
[61:27.67]I get it.
[61:28.39]I got ya.
[61:29.13]Watch this one.
[61:31.09]Fucking get the, I gotta go to the secret tunnel.
[61:36.47]And then... Press the fucking secret tunnel button right here.
[61:41.95]Press the secret button.
[61:44.37]Watch the aquarium.
[61:45.25]Wait for, like, the fucking stingray to go by.
[61:52.43]Alright, Stingray went by.
[61:54.17]And I'm just back at square one.
[61:55.29]Can I press that button before the door opens?
[62:09.46]Can I get in there before the water gets all the way up?
[62:11.10]No, I can't.
[62:12.30]Okay.
[62:18.76]What if I press this and then just swim to the right?
[62:21.04]Can I get up there in time?
[62:27.54]Yeah, I can't.
[62:27.98]So what the fuck was the point of the secret tunnel?
[62:30.08]What the fuck was the point of that?
[62:33.02]I would have tried that first if it wasn't for the secret tunnel on the left.
[62:36.34]Why did I need to open that?
[62:37.20]What was the point of that?
[62:48.19]Why did it want me to backtrack around that?
[62:50.75]Oh, it's because I have to bring this fucking coffin.
[62:54.09]Alright, I get it.
[62:54.79]So you want me to bring the fucking dead person in the fucking coffin over to the left.
[62:58.19]I'm gonna go to the secret tunnel again.
[63:00.88]Okay.
[63:01.50]Sounds fun.
[63:01.98]What's in here?
[63:02.50]Anything else?
[63:08.26]So I came all the way over to the right, all this way, to come get my fucking tuba for band practice.
[63:13.01]Okay, great.
[63:15.09]Awesome.
[63:23.45]Don't worry, I'm just a little late.
[63:24.67]I'm a little late to band.
[63:28.81]Right there.
[63:33.63]Got two re-subscriptions.
[63:39.66]Oh my god, we've got some re-subscriptions.
[63:48.86]Okay.
[63:50.06]Can I do anything up here?
[63:52.40]Vast Dragon, thank you for five months.
[63:54.12]Inky the Blot, thank you for seven months.
[63:57.14]Thank you to the two of you.
[63:58.08]So look, there wasn't even like a fucking reason for that secret entrance.
[64:02.40]Maybe there was, but you know, I kind of, I don't even care.
[64:04.42]Oh, he's not going to go do like the secret thing?
[64:06.84]Don't care.
[64:09.02]I kind of care.
[64:10.10]I care a little bit.
[64:11.40]Hold on, let me see if I can Tarzan over there.
[64:19.22]I can Tarzan over there, right?
[64:23.99]I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.
[64:26.11]I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
[64:29.19]Why would I need to do that?
[64:36.20]I thought there was gonna be like a ledge or something.
[64:38.38]Nope, no ledge.
[64:53.40]I don't even care.
[64:53.92]Watch out for that snake.
[64:54.98]Watch out for that snake right there.
[65:01.79]That's funny.
[65:02.69]That's funny.
[65:06.13]All brawn, boys.
[65:07.43]All brawn.
[65:08.37]What the fuck?
[65:12.73]Sure, this is a master secret hunter.
[65:19.99]Oh, God, that was fucking... That was a nice air shot.
[65:24.81]You are so dumb.
[65:25.73]I'm not even... I'm just fucking having fun.
[65:28.13]Give a guy a fucking... Give a mouse a cookie, you know?
[65:30.52]Give a guy a break.
[65:31.66]Give a mouse a cookie.
[65:39.56]Obviously stand here, because that's where the... Didn't even play Metal Gear Solid 2.
[65:44.91]Yes, I did.
[65:45.43]Yes, I did.
[65:46.49]Don't fucking spread that rumor.
[65:49.25]I can't do it in one go.
[65:50.09]Can't do it in one go.
[66:02.08]I get it now.
[66:02.66]It takes a second.
[66:05.40]So rude to the streamer.
[66:06.92]Wow.
[66:09.84]It moves.
[66:10.58]I'm going to have to keep track of that shit.
[66:15.38]Starts like right here.
[66:20.76]Okay, right here.
[66:26.02]Okay.
[66:28.58]Wait till it moves again.
[66:29.92]And go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[66:36.30]Might need to do it one more time.
[66:37.75]Yeah, we'll do it one more time.
[66:39.33]I'm not going to die to this.
[66:40.39]I'm scared.
[66:48.73]Guys, it usually sucks.
[66:51.52]Hey.
[66:52.14]Hey.
[66:53.12]You know what?
[66:53.76]You know what?
[66:55.04]Ban that guy.
[66:57.64]Oh, God!
[66:58.40]Get me the cage!
[67:02.72]Give that guy a life sentence.
[67:04.12]You know what it is.
[67:06.26]A life sentence of fucking two seconds.
[67:08.36]You know how it works.
[67:09.48]There's no... Okay, I got... I just got fucking trolled.
[67:14.02]What happened to the Kingpin Game of Swears video?
[67:17.05]It was deleted.
[67:19.45]I went on, like, a mass deletion of videos, like, two years ago.
[67:23.07]And I, like, some other videos got, like, caught in the crossfire.
[67:27.42]Because I was, like, checking the boxes.
[67:28.96]Like, check, check, check, check, check.
[67:31.36]On the YouTube video manager page.
[67:34.52]And I, like, accidentally deleted, like, fucking five videos that I probably... I didn't even, like, really mean to.
[67:39.30]There you go.
[67:39.64]There's your explanation.
[67:40.66]But thank you for five months, Mr. Champ.
[67:44.64]Appreciate it.
[67:48.24]Oh god, get back in the cage, get back in the cage.
[67:56.29]I like deleted a bunch of like old streams and old like videos that were just like shit videos that were like just taking up space.
[68:04.47]There were like a bunch of like old like four hour stream videos that I just like deleted.
[68:08.03]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose, I'm gonna lose.
[68:10.85]I gotta open up a secret door.
[68:14.66]Open it.
[68:15.78]Should I go in?
[68:16.24]Go in.
[68:16.74]Okay.
[68:21.67]reupload?
[68:22.21]I don't have it anymore.
[68:25.65]Hey, Jeremy.
[68:26.21]Three might not be as much five, but I'll gladly throw more money at you to keep streaming.
[68:30.59]No, thank you.
[68:31.75]Hirano.
[68:32.16]I appreciate it.
[68:32.92]Thanks for three months.
[68:35.80]I'm going to keep streaming.
[68:36.70]It's something I'm having a lot of fun doing, so...
[68:39.91]I didn't delete a button.
[68:41.45]I'm an idiot.
[68:42.07]This is all it is to it.
[68:42.85]Did you see I was standing on top of the fucking door while I was trying to open it?
[68:45.99]Do you guys understand?
[68:47.73]Okay, I knew I could grab that, but can I grab this?
[68:56.80]I don't think so.
[69:01.18]Never leave us?
[69:03.60]I'll try not to.
[69:17.89]You're going to have to upload five videos in a week to make up for that.
[69:21.23]Actually, my YouTube channel over the next couple... I would say in the next week and a half is going to start to have a shitload of videos.
[69:29.96]I actually am in the process of making a video right now where I talk about the real plan.
[69:36.02]Because it is a real plan.
[69:36.96]It's a set in stone plan.
[69:38.14]Can I drop from here?
[69:39.70]Yes.
[69:40.34]Take a shower.
[69:41.08]Why can't you take a shower before you go out again?
[69:42.54]I've been all over the place.
[69:47.27]The egg video?
[69:47.81]Yeah, the egg video is still there.
[69:54.12]Yeah.
[69:55.70]You don't have to believe me.
[69:56.78]I don't expect you to.
[70:02.55]There's one really, really, really important huge video that's coming out in August.
[70:06.93]But besides that one, there's going to be a lot of videos.
[70:12.01]There's going to be a rebirth of my channel.
[70:14.11]Don't worry.
[70:21.31]There's a set in stone plan- Hold on, I can't talk about this for a second.
[70:23.99]Dogs.
[70:24.79]Coming after me.
[70:27.29]Do dogs go in the water?
[70:28.15]I know what to do.
[70:28.97]Just like Willy Wonka, swim up the fucking tube.
[70:31.81]Nope.
[70:34.25]Let's take a look down here.
[70:43.02]No, hold on, I don't wanna drown!
[70:50.12]The video where I said I had a schedule well that was just stupid because I was about I wanted to make a smite video every week And I was just like why the fuck did I say that?
[71:00.83]That video I deleted that video because it was a dumb video because it was a schedule I wasn't going to adhere to I adhered to it for like two fucking three weeks And I was just like I don't want to make a smite video anymore Get back in the water
[71:23.67]Same way you're streaming three or four times a week.
[71:25.45]I've streamed a lot over the last couple months.
[71:28.30]You gotta give me a little bit of credit there.
[71:31.72]He comes in the fucking water?
[71:33.52]What?
[71:36.08]Since when?
[71:36.54]I mean, I might take like a break for like a week for various reasons, but...
[71:44.00]I usually stream it at least a couple times a week.
[71:46.92]So does he come all the way in?
[71:48.42]No.
[71:48.66]Why did he come in the water last time?
[71:50.52]What the fuck?
[71:51.70]I just gotta out-swim him.
[71:52.56]Okay.
[71:53.34]Out-swim the dog.
[71:54.06]Does he dive?
[71:55.32]He dives too.
[71:56.94]What a terror.
[71:59.43]Go.
[72:07.25]He doesn't come that way.
[72:13.26]Man!
[72:15.16]I feel like this is just the part where you just gotta run.
[72:19.76]You gotta... This is gonna be bring around the fucking Rosie.
[72:24.27]Okay, we gotta go around.
[72:24.95]Go around!
[72:26.65]Go around!
[72:27.17]You gotta go around!
[72:36.19]How did they know?
[72:37.23]How did they know?
[72:37.70]They would never have known.
[72:38.92]Dogs aren't that smart.
[72:50.67]Pull it off you fucking weakling This is our way Okay, go now
[73:20.50]Nice.
[73:21.38]That's fine.
[73:22.65]Unless they can climb through that, which I'm just going to keep running.
[73:28.95]Secret door?
[73:30.39]Nope.
[73:32.36]Not enough brawn.
[73:33.04]See, I'm supposed to have brawn.
[73:34.34]I don't have enough brawn.
[73:42.23]But to close the whole YouTube thing.
[73:45.65]I've said this before.
[73:47.45]But I... I like... I need to care about the things that I'm doing.
[73:51.86]And if I don't care anymore... Then... I don't want to do them.
[73:57.00]Oh, fuck!
[73:58.98]Is he gonna break my neck?
[73:59.60]Is he breaking my neck?!
[74:08.57]So, can I... Oh, okay.
[74:10.07]There's somebody coming up to talk to him.
[74:12.73]If I have like an idea... Like, it's all about ideas and...
[74:16.98]I don't want to be just one of those fucking people that just throws up shit every day and doesn't give a fuck about any of it.
[74:23.20]I want to, like, care about the things I do.
[74:27.38]Go, go, go, go, go.
[74:33.63]I thought I was dead.
[74:36.01]Can I get in the submarine?
[74:39.19]Oh, man.
[74:39.73]This is weird.
[74:48.74]But the videos that I'd be going to... Here's what's happening, alright?
[74:51.14]I'll give you... This is the, like, 1,500, 1,600 people that are here right now.
[74:54.84]You get the... Exactly the video that I'm making.
[74:57.18]I'll say it to you in, like, two sentences, okay?
[75:01.54]When I stream games... I'm sure some of you guys have been around.
[75:05.56]So, back in the day, I used to record videos.
[75:07.96]Like, I would just... For instance, that pirate game that I played, like, last week...
[75:13.33]I would have just recorded that and made a video on it.
[75:17.73]But instead, I streamed it.
[75:20.17]And some fun things happened, some interesting things were going on in that video, or in that stream, and it's gonna be a video.
[75:25.60]Like, that stream is going to be cut up into, like, a YouTube video.
[75:29.48]Not a full, like, four-hour fucking stream, but, like, a series of maybe, like, six, like, eight, twelve, fifteen-minute videos.
[75:37.50]Maybe, like, two or three of them.
[75:38.63]Maybe.
[75:39.21]If they're any good.
[75:41.87]In the meantime, videos like the one... I'm just, like, locked in this room right now.
[75:46.17]What the hell am I doing?
[75:46.87]I need to, like, look around.
[75:50.47]Can I go, like, through this gate?
[75:51.99]Can I, like, smash through it?
[75:57.46]In the meantime... Let's, like, stop moving so I can do this.
[76:02.01]It is Holy Mackerel.
[76:02.99]Yeah.
[76:03.41]It's Kalem.
[76:03.91]He is going to be the Mr. Highlight Man.
[76:06.97]He is going to be the highlighter.
[76:08.25]He's done a great job so far.
[76:10.91]In the meantime, I can focus on videos like the ones that are going to come out in August.
[76:15.69]So... I'm actually locked in here.
[76:23.44]Every, like, couple months, you're gonna get, like, a huge video that costs, like, a bunch of money.
[76:27.50]And that's, like, a big, high production value video.
[76:30.72]In the meantime, you're gonna get videos that would have been uploaded anyways.
[76:34.00]If I were to record them myself.
[76:35.39]But instead, I stream them.
[76:37.53]Fallout New Vegas, for instance, is gonna be a couple videos.
[76:43.15]But I wanna focus, like, besides streaming, I really wanna focus on the videos like the ones you're gonna see in August.
[76:48.21]And that's all I gotta say.
[76:52.92]But honest to God, what the fuck am I doing?
[76:58.50]Can I get out?
[77:00.84]Oh, maybe I can get out.
[77:02.02]Should I get out of this thing?
[77:02.88]What the hell is going on?
[77:08.20]Whoa!
[77:08.36]I didn't know you could do that.
[77:12.07]Holy shit, you can just like... Alright, didn't know you could even do this weird fucking Sonic the Hedgehog move.
[77:22.71]Listen to me, son.
[77:25.19]I'm your dad.
[77:27.61]Destroy him!
[77:31.07]Whoa!
[77:32.07]This is crazy.
[77:33.81]Thrillville, thanks to you.
[77:35.03]Thanks to you.
[77:35.49]Welcome to the channel.
[77:37.85]Welcome to your subscription.
[77:39.17]Thank you for your support.
[77:40.09]Appreciate it, dude.
[77:41.51]What am I looking at here?
[77:45.23]Nerf this.
[77:48.78]Look, I found a little...
[77:51.43]Armor hole take a look though.
[77:55.58]Let's rush Let's do our Sonic the Hedgehog move and blast forward.
[78:00.04]That's why I look down here.
[78:00.90]I don't okay secret keeper Anything else over here Probably not but somebody somebody will fucking yell at me if I don't go over here.
[78:16.96]Oh
[78:19.67]See, that's a secret.
[78:21.49]Secret.
[78:22.53]Yep.
[78:23.09]Secret cave.
[78:25.39]Secret cave, boys.
[78:26.47]It wasn't a secret cave.
[78:37.25]Anything else?
[78:44.52]This is an unpopular opinion, but I love quality over quantity.
[78:47.76]So you like the new direction?
[78:49.47]It's... Honestly, it's just something I've been thinking about doing for a long time.
[78:54.31]Because, like, even back when I recorded videos, like, it took me, like, a week or two to, like, come up with, like, an idea I wanted to do or a certain game I wanted to play.
[79:02.17]And that doesn't mean, like, I'm not gonna record, like, gaming videos anymore.
[79:06.67]It's just... I'm going to stream most of the games that I want to play, even the games that I want to make videos on, and then, like, I'm just gonna make... have videos made from them.
[79:16.88]That's it.
[79:21.54]And then in the meantime, like I said, the big projects that I want to spend a shitload of time on, potentially like months of time, I can do that.
[79:29.36]And that's like the big videos that you'll get once a month or once every couple months.
[79:34.80]That's the new philosophy.
[79:39.32]Why did somebody just clip that?
[79:41.32]Did somebody just clip me walking backwards?
[79:46.14]DESTROY HIM!
[79:50.44]Thank you, Zini.
[79:53.48]Welcome to the group of... Welcome to the three... How many amigos do we have so far?
[79:59.17]We have like six amigos.
[80:00.63]There's like six new amigos.
[80:02.05]The six amigos.
[80:03.63]And then like nine babies.
[80:09.31]Do you remember pranks coming soon?
[80:10.94]No, no prank videos.
[80:17.48]Two.
[80:17.82]Let's look over.
[80:18.34]Let's see if there's another thing over here.
[80:21.70]Did you get funding for Clown in the Town?
[80:24.10]No, this video that's coming out in August is 100% out of my pocket.
[80:30.87]I wish I could talk about it.
[80:32.47]I wish I could scream at the mountaintops what it is.
[80:35.17]But... It's going to be fucking crazy.
[80:38.17]That's all I can tell you.
[80:40.14]At least I hope so.
[80:41.56]There's no way it won't be.
[80:43.14]Even if the video sucks.
[80:44.94]Even if the video fucking sucks.
[80:47.04]It's going to be insane.
[80:50.65]So there's a little armor hole right there.
[80:52.97]Secret over there.
[80:53.55]I don't know if it's a secret.
[80:56.25]I'm gonna look around.
[80:57.27]Just in case, you know, I can get up here.
[80:59.37]Can I walk on that?
[81:03.55]No.
[81:06.88]Alright, get back in the fucking... Get back in the... Mine.
[81:10.32]Okay, let's just go.
[81:16.50]Can I jump?
[81:17.92]Wait, can I jump up there?
[81:24.19]Okay.
[81:25.45]Is there a place for me to jump this way?
[81:30.28]Not really.
[81:31.92]Keep that in mind, though.
[81:35.42]Ooh.
[81:39.06]I guess I... At what point is this going to break?
[81:42.76]The whole thing's going to explode.
[81:45.04]It's not going to be pretty.
[81:48.36]Oh, for the love of fucking God.
[81:50.44]You saw me.
[81:50.94]I was aiming at it.
[81:56.02]The fuck?
[81:58.62]Smash it.
[82:02.58]What else is it gonna take?
[82:03.34]Does this whole thing have to come down?
[82:06.70]There's only one more spot.
[82:15.21]The whole fucking thing is coming down.
[82:19.71]Oh, hold on a second.
[82:20.99]Hold on just a second.
[82:22.23]I think I may have just figured it out.
[82:23.89]Okey dokey.
[82:26.02]Let's get on out of this and jump in the water.
[82:29.04]Okay.
[82:37.59]Wimp Grump McWerp.
[82:40.37]Welcome, dude.
[82:41.05]Thank you for your subscription.
[82:44.02]Have fun.
[82:46.04]Wait, don't go down that far.
[82:48.48]I'm not in the bubble anymore.
[82:52.71]But thank you, Wimp Grump.
[82:54.19]Much appreciated.
[82:56.09]You decided to give me five dollars.
[83:00.46]Just go ahead and take that five and toss that right in the pocket.
[83:04.32]There we go.
[83:06.34]Oh, thanks, dude.
[83:11.78]Climb the electric cable.
[83:18.27]Okay.
[83:21.71]Now where the hell am I?
[83:26.28]That's just back down where I was.
[83:31.96]It's 3 a.m.
[83:33.54]It is not 3 a.m.
[83:34.89]It is 8 p.m.
[83:39.47]I wonder if I can read your name correctly.
[83:40.89]That guy in a trash can.
[83:43.35]Yeah, I can read your name.
[83:57.17]How was I ever supposed to know that was gonna happen?
[84:01.57]Alright.
[84:02.75]They come out and squash you.
[84:16.34]What?!
[84:17.94]It fucking killed me?
[84:19.04]It did not kill me.
[84:19.94]I was fine.
[84:21.24]Please.
[84:22.40]This kid took way more pain and way more beatings than that one.
[84:25.37]Give me a fucking break.
[84:31.39]Don't jump this time.
[84:36.49]What's in these?
[84:36.99]Is there something in them that I need to look at?
[84:40.67]Or what?
[84:43.95]Let me just look.
[84:45.12]You know, someone's gonna be like, Dude, you missed it!
[84:46.62]There was a fucking dead body that had like a key in it!
[84:52.42]Secret.
[84:54.54]Secret!
[84:59.83]How do I get that open?
[85:03.11]How the fuck do I open that?
[85:14.08]Baconator 6.
[85:15.04]Thank you, Baconator.
[85:15.76]You're welcome.
[85:17.26]Hold on a minute.
[85:18.88]Seriously, how the fuck do I open that?
[85:25.70]I can't open it with this.
[85:27.12]I'm gonna fucking drown again.
[85:28.25]Come on.
[85:29.05]Get up there, you little kid.
[85:30.85]There you go.
[85:32.31]Baconator 6, though.
[85:33.19]Thank you.
[85:33.91]Baconator 6, though.
[85:37.49]Welcome.
[85:40.82]Your $5 is gonna go towards... Probably... Uh, me eating a burrito.
[85:49.10]Or... Maybe not.
[85:52.53]Possibly something else.
[85:54.86]Maybe to the... Hold on, I gotta shut the fuck up here.
[85:58.89]I know what I gotta do.
[85:59.77]Oh shit, it ran my hands over.
[86:02.21]Okay, we'll just get the fuck back up there.
[86:08.72]It just squished my fingers.
[86:09.90]It rolled over both my hands.
[86:13.82]Well, I have two broken hands now.
[86:24.63]This door should be open.
[86:32.06]I missed a secret.
[86:34.00]Yeah, can you believe it, honey?
[86:35.42]He missed a secret.
[86:37.76]This guy calls himself a live streamer.
[86:40.65]He missed like two secrets already.
[86:43.23]Wait, what?
[86:45.05]How the fuck am I?
[86:45.81]Am I even watching this idiot?
[86:47.75]Whoa, and we have liftoff.
[86:50.54]Come on, you're not strong enough?
[86:51.68]Alright, that guy just hit the thing at the carnival to make the bell go up.
[86:56.98]And he got, like, he... You know, like I said, like, right here, right in the middle, it says, like, oh, weakling!
[87:01.63]That guy got fucking weakling.
[87:02.71]You gotta go all the way to the top and have, like, macho man.
[87:05.39]See, he hit, like, weakling.
[87:08.63]Didn't even ring the fucking bell.
[87:19.30]I'm not gonna press F.
[87:23.06]Can you believe this idiot?
[87:24.94]This stupid fucking idiot just didn't even go to the secret.
[87:29.99]I didn't even like that joke about the guy hitting the thing with the hammer.
[87:33.53]He didn't even say hammer.
[87:34.59]What a fucking idiot.
[87:35.83]Let's get out of here, honey.
[87:37.73]Fuck me.
[87:38.45]Fuck me.
[87:41.39]That's not what you got to do.
[87:42.29]I know what you got to do.
[87:47.82]I know what you got to do.
[87:56.19]Sounds like Roger from American Dad.
[88:03.84]Idiot streamer.
[88:06.36]With pleasure.
[88:07.42]Oh, no, don't really leave.
[88:08.38]I was kidding.
[88:10.10]This is a joke.
[88:15.81]Dinner and a movie first.
[88:17.11]I was just kidding, man.
[88:18.53]Wait, let me look over here.
[88:19.63]I'm just out of curiosity.
[88:24.49]New game.
[88:29.56]Doesn't seem like there's anything over here.
[88:34.14]Just wanted to take a look, just in case somebody yelled at me.
[88:38.28]I already played YouTubers Live.
[88:39.46]I played it like a week ago.
[88:46.31]I just saw somebody say that I have not played Metal Gear Solid... Grab it, please.
[88:53.94]I would like that person that said that I haven't played Metal Gear Solid 2 to get a life sentence ban.
[89:01.54]No, you know what?
[89:02.14]Two life sentences.
[89:03.34]Four seconds.
[89:07.70]New to the stream, enjoying inside.
[89:08.86]I am.
[89:09.26]It is very, very interesting.
[89:12.46]Thank you for asking.
[89:15.74]Oh, okay.
[89:17.51]I have to do like a CS:GO surf and make it through the hole.
[89:23.95]There we are.
[89:28.57]Button.
[89:30.54]Let's just wait.
[89:32.50]I feel like this is a waiting time.
[89:38.42]Not harsh enough, send her to prison.
[89:39.66]Prison is ten seconds.
[89:42.12]I don't know, I... No, that's actually, that's the death sentence.
[89:46.93]Ten second ban is you got the death sentence.
[89:50.19]I don't use that lightly.
[89:58.75]So...
[90:00.64]What did this do?
[90:02.06]This opened up... That.
[90:06.26]So I can jump through now.
[90:08.72]I can actually use the jump.
[90:10.54]So let's use the jump.
[90:17.54]There's aliens in the fucking water.
[90:19.18]There's aliens... I'm freaking... Go!
[90:20.93]Don't drown!
[90:21.43]Don't drown!
[90:21.97]I'm freaking out about that guy in the water.
[90:23.63]Why is it an alien?
[90:27.33]It's always an alien.
[90:29.09]It's probably not an alien.
[90:34.13]Alright, let's go for it.
[90:35.03]Let's do the jump.
[90:40.59]Not quite.
[90:41.79]Not quite.
[90:46.91]We did it.
[90:52.76]No, don't get out.
[90:53.78]Stay in.
[90:54.84]Might be something down here.
[91:00.36]Am I going to stream more New Vegas?
[91:01.80]I don't know.
[91:04.94]Probably not.
[91:06.04]I don't want to get anybody's hopes up.
[91:07.46]But there will be videos.
[91:10.22]One of these days I won't be late to your stream.
[91:12.50]Well.
[91:14.18]Chef Laram, thank you for your three months.
[91:15.84]And whatever you're here.
[91:17.04]Did I miss?
[91:17.84]I missed Bosco.
[91:20.34]Bosco, how did I miss you?
[91:21.36]I'm going to call you Bosco.
[91:22.93]Bosco DeBear.
[91:25.11]Thank you for four months, dude.
[91:25.95]I don't know how I missed it.
[91:26.71]I didn't hear it.
[91:28.41]Oh, I can smash this, can't I?
[91:31.21]Smashed.
[91:34.80]Secret?
[91:35.08]Is this a secret?
[91:42.20]Stream the Skyrim Remastered.
[91:43.78]That might be an interesting idea.
[91:44.92]I don't know.
[91:49.13]Bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard.
[91:56.35]Secret!
[91:58.33]I actually found a secret.
[92:00.25]You didn't think I was ever going to find a secret, did you?
[92:03.19]Well, sorry.
[92:05.58]Sorry, I found one.
[92:09.69]Yeah, there's probably like fucking gold in here.
[92:11.45]There's probably treasures and shit in there.
[92:12.81]Hold on, don't go in the secret yet.
[92:17.19]Just take a look around.
[92:18.61]Look up here.
[92:21.05]Yeah, okay.
[92:21.89]Yeah, sorry.
[92:22.79]It's time to check out the fucking secret.
[92:31.86]There's money in the water.
[92:33.48]It's like floating cash.
[92:40.88]It's a pretty dumb secret.
[92:42.98]There better be a dead body at the end of this that I can poke with a stick.
[92:51.03]What the fuck is going on?
[92:57.59]This is not... This is a good secret.
[93:03.94]Was the other secret a secret?
[93:06.44]I think the other secret might have been a real secret.
[93:08.82]This doesn't look like a secret.
[93:12.80]Yeah, this is definitely not a secret.
[93:16.64]Oh, no.
[93:17.38]Maybe it is a secret.
[93:21.77]Can he get in?
[93:26.91]Get inside.
[93:27.49]You control the fucking submarine now.
[93:34.48]Yeah, he can get in.
[93:36.76]I'll show you later.
[93:41.70]Can I... Can I jump with this?
[93:45.88]I'm kind of not sure what to do here.
[93:54.93]Will you fucking get inside?
[93:56.19]I know you're like a brainless idiot.
[93:57.81]Get in the fucking boat.
[94:01.37]Oh my god, get inside and stay... Get in the submarine.
[94:16.97]Hold on, hold on.
[94:18.24]Can I do this?
[94:20.66]I want to jump and get up and grab it, right?
[94:23.14]Like James Bond.
[94:25.60]I'm going to scream.
[94:26.82]I'm going to scream.
[94:29.60]Alright.
[94:34.94]Now, I'm going for a jump.
[94:40.42]Get out!
[94:45.69]Alright.
[94:47.14]Get out!
[94:47.30]Get out!
[94:47.60]Grab it!
[94:50.14]Oh, fine.
[94:50.68]I know.
[94:51.14]Get over here.
[94:51.60]I know what I gotta do.
[94:53.88]Get up here, you fucking idiot.
[94:56.47]I have to do that.
[94:59.61]Right?
[95:00.03]So I have to, like, get in?
[95:03.99]Why is he up?
[95:07.89]Is that what I have to do?
[95:10.51]Like, get him?
[95:11.49]No.
[95:12.03]Hold on.
[95:14.11]That's not actually what you have to do, right?
[95:16.86]Is that... I don't know.
[95:17.90]I don't know.
[95:18.40]This is a secret.
[95:23.47]But how do I get him to get out if I want him to get out?
[95:26.39]Can I get him out mid-air?
[95:30.15]The only thing I can think about doing here is getting out and then getting in.
[95:37.04]Is he going to come with me?
[95:42.28]Can I just stuff him up there?
[95:46.26]I don't think so.
[95:55.37]Get his head in there!
[95:57.23]Oh, shit.
[96:00.25]Hmm.
[96:03.62]No, I can't grab it because I need to, like, control the other guy to be able to grab it, right?
[96:15.31]Oh!
[96:16.35]He's up there.
[96:17.41]Don't freak out, don't freak out, don't freak out, don't freak out.
[96:19.95]Now I get up there.
[96:21.87]I got it.
[96:22.29]Nice.
[96:22.83]Okay.
[96:23.49]Don't fuck this up.
[96:24.33]I wish there was a save state, because I'm going to fuck this up.
[96:33.64]What is he doing?
[96:36.10]Oh, what the f- What happened?
[96:40.14]Friends in low pla- Okay, where's my secret?
[96:50.21]A guy just broke a robotic vacuum cleaner.
[96:53.13]That's my secret.
[96:58.89]That's it.
[97:00.11]Okay.
[97:01.73]That's the secret.
[97:07.34]Remind me to never do that again.
[97:11.00]Everybody that was talking about how I'm not getting the secrets, you just saw what his secret was.
[97:16.84]I'm not doing that again.
[97:17.70]He just broke a fucking piece of machinery.
[97:22.94]Now you see why I didn't do the first one.
[97:27.48]Worth it.
[97:31.19]Disappointment.
[97:33.37]People are talking about secrets.
[97:36.86]Let me guess, if you pull all those plugs, you get the good ending, right?
[97:41.32]Because everyone's connected to the machine at the very end.
[97:44.26]And the guy that's the robot machine is like, yes, you got to the end, but you didn't unplug me from all my little mini-brains, and I still can control it.
[97:52.45]And you're like, no, you'll fucking lose.
[97:55.53]But if you pull all the cords, then he tries to suck power from those other cords, and he's like, what's happening?
[98:00.05]How could this happen?
[98:00.73]How could this be?
[98:02.00]And you win.
[98:02.50]Okay, cool.
[98:03.16]Good game.
[98:03.88]What a great game.
[98:04.46]Game sucks.
[98:07.92]No, Gabe doesn't suck.
[98:16.35]Oh, let me get like the... Let me put myself in the McDonald's hamburger heater lamp.
[98:24.38]Oh.
[98:24.80]Oh, this is reflection.
[98:25.54]Never mind.
[98:34.32]Alright, what do I do here?
[98:36.88]Secret ending.
[98:38.38]It's the gate G. Gate G. Almost.
[98:42.68]Almost.
[98:48.22]Any armor holes here?
[98:53.73]Not really.
[98:57.17]Oh, can I bump into that button?
[99:00.09]No.
[99:01.67]I just gotta get out and press it.

[100:42.01]You don't ever find it.
[100:45.02]That is Carter Petersburg.
[100:46.44]I don't even realize the things that I'm doing.
[100:47.90]Did I press the button already?
[100:50.40]No.
[100:50.52]No.
[100:55.35]Get back up there.
[100:56.15]Go push the button.
[101:06.79]Don't drown here.
[101:08.27]Please.
[101:11.84]Just out of curiosity.
[101:16.77]I wonder what happens if I push it again.
[101:17.99]Ah, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a second.
[101:28.99]If there's no there, you know, if there's no.
[101:30.59]Then I'm just going to swim on the other side.
[101:35.11]Aha.
[101:38.49]What?
[101:39.17]What?
[101:45.20]And now I can actually swim with this and not bump my head on the ground.
[101:50.89]You know, the know.
[101:51.45]Hey DSuperman06, thank you for your resubscription for three months.
[102:03.87]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[102:05.85]You can hear the gears squeaking.
[102:08.29]Yeah, it's pretty rusty in there, I will tell you.
[102:11.93]Pretty dirty in there too.
[102:16.78]Tapping does nothing.
[102:17.48]I don't know why I keep trying to do it.
[102:18.62]I just don't want to drown.
[102:20.42]Okay.
[102:20.52]I feel like these gameplay mechanics are way too underappreciated.
[102:31.17]I don't... I'm appreciating them.
[102:32.71]I think it's cool.
[102:39.28]Should I jump through that?
[102:41.87]Instead of going under, I just want to look this way, because I can walk... No.
[102:47.12]Actually, I can go this way.
[102:48.18]What's the point of that?
[102:50.78]No, that's where I went before.
[102:51.94]I can't jump up or anything, so... Let's just get back in the ship.
[103:12.37]What a dog.
[103:14.27]What a dog thing to do.
[103:22.34]Take it easy, Nathan.
[103:23.06]Thanks for stopping by, dude.
[103:29.32]Nice, we get to barrel through.
[103:30.62]We get to go through and watch this.
[103:32.94]It's gonna be so crazy.
[103:34.12]Smash!
[103:36.30]Oh, I just... I'm fucked.
[103:38.68]Smash him.
[103:40.00]Smash him.
[103:43.10]I know what I could do.
[103:43.70]Gameplay mechanics.
[103:44.34]You would teach me this to smash these fucking people.
[103:49.92]I'll get him.
[103:52.70]Fucking crush him.
[103:54.50]Crush his body.
[103:58.56]I don't know if I'm really bad at this or if I'm just not supposed to do this.
[104:02.59]I don't think I'm supposed to do it.
[104:08.09]Get away, you fuck.
[104:10.15]He doesn't like the light.
[104:10.85]Shine the light in his eyes.
[104:13.71]Ah, I hit him.
[104:14.35]I hit him, but didn't do anything.
[104:19.49]Whatever, he's just gonna... This is just Big Boo from Super Mario.
[104:25.22]I got ya.
[104:28.22]It was like the... The Big Boo noise.
[104:33.45]Okay, that sounds like a shitty horse.
[104:37.49]I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[104:39.29]What happens?
[104:42.42]I just want to know.
[104:43.32]You know we have to see what happens, right?
[104:44.60]He's breaking the glass.
[104:53.08]Oh my god.
[104:54.02]Okay.
[104:59.05]Don't let him touch you.
[105:01.03]Don't let them touch you.
[105:02.25]Does he have long hair?
[105:11.75]You're not that scary now that I know what you are.
[105:13.33]You're just like a little weirdo with long hair.
[105:18.81]There's gonna be more than one now.
[105:20.47]I guarantee it.
[105:21.79]Hey.
[105:22.69]Secret.
[105:24.26]Watch this one.
[105:24.70]You didn't even fucking know this.
[105:26.16]Smash it.
[105:27.48]Secret.
[105:27.78]You can't get, you know.
[105:29.40]Told you.
[105:36.22]See, so many people probably play through this part like, Gosh, shit, it's so annoying.
[105:38.88]How do you get rid of this guy?
[105:39.90]You gotta do the secret.
[105:46.72]What's going on?
[105:47.16]Why is it in slow motion?
[105:54.39]World record pace.
[105:56.75]Getting there.
[105:59.63]Nice life hack.
[106:04.14]I feel like I'm moving too slow in this thing.
[106:05.72]And I'm just... I don't even want to be... You don't go left ever in this game.
[106:09.84]I always just go right.
[106:11.70]Even if there might be a secret back here.
[106:13.92]But we already saw what the secrets are.
[106:15.12]Why do I care?
[106:16.82]We've already been shown that the secrets are just a guy... Oh, come on.
[106:21.41]Do you tell me I really gotta... Am I gonna get the secret down here?
[106:31.32]That was pretty hardcore.
[106:32.86]Hold on a second.
[106:33.57]Wait a minute.
[106:34.01]Wait a minute.
[106:34.33]I think I'm supposed to do that.
[106:37.23]Dude!
[106:38.17]Look at that shit.
[106:39.89]Look at me.
[106:40.43]Hey.
[106:41.85]Look at me.
[106:43.05]Look at me finding secrets.
[106:46.62]Get up there.
[106:47.08]Get up there, you little shit.
[106:50.20]Look at that secret.
[106:53.70]Let's rip the cord out.
[106:57.66]Press our eyes against the... What is it?
[106:59.51]Something's going to be there.
[107:02.44]Just wait for the jump scare.
[107:03.24]It's going to happen.
[107:06.14]There's going to be like a huge fish that just puts his shark's face in there.
[107:09.62]You know what I mean?
[107:12.37]Come on.
[107:14.57]Fine.
[107:15.15]Start the lawnmower.
[107:15.79]Alright.
[107:18.03]Now it's going to happen.
[107:26.43]Dumb.
[107:28.01]Found it.
[107:28.43]I found it.
[107:37.46]Guys didn't even know I found that secret.
[107:39.42]Half of you guys talking shit.
[107:42.84]Half of you guys talking shit about how I don't find secrets.
[107:45.22]Just found two of them in a row.
[107:52.04]The Death Star disco ball.
[107:53.57]Yeah, it kind of is.
[107:54.19]There's gonna be some dolphin jumps in the meantime.
[108:04.73]What is the lawnmower for?
[108:05.89]Nothing.
[108:06.87]All it does is at the very end of the game, the big computer brain that's controlling all the humans, says a big monolog about, Oh no, how could this be?
[108:16.48]I put my brain scattered around the entire universe.
[108:20.44]It's not possible.
[108:21.32]How could a small child be able to do that?
[108:25.09]It's not possible.
[108:27.43]And the whole moral of the story is, even little guys, even big guys, little guys got some big stuff in their brains.
[108:38.45]Even little guys got, you know, big brains.
[108:40.67]And then, you know, even the small, like the Hobbit.
[108:44.32]You know, the Hobbit, you know, even little guys can get going and get it started.
[108:47.86]And that's Bill Bobaggan saves the day.
[108:50.62]Even little guys can save the day.
[108:56.06]You missed my message from last month?
[108:57.68]Marry me, Stilvan.
[108:58.96]Thank you for four months.
[108:59.92]And I'm going to have to respectfully decline.
[109:01.88]I want to be a single boy.
[109:02.96]I did ask him to hold it.
[109:09.61]Oh no, watch out for the giant muffin tree!
[109:11.39]Oh, there's my grandfather.
[109:14.45]He's thinking he can speak English.
[109:15.43]Oh, I didn't learn before time.
[109:18.08]Left it, you little fuck.
[109:25.26]Oh, you are.
[109:26.24]Never mind.
[109:26.82]Little guys don't have big stuff in their brains.
[109:36.11]I'm going to get a Tinder update.
[109:37.23]You want a Tinder update?
[109:38.99]Alright, here it is.
[109:41.03]Game sucks.
[109:42.75]Tinder sucks.
[109:44.75]No, I just don't... The update I gave last time, I didn't really give a shit.
[109:51.16]If somebody wants to talk, then we talk.
[109:52.82]But I'm not going to be like, oh, let me ask you some questions.
[109:56.88]Where did you go to school?
[109:59.29]I don't fucking care anymore.
[110:04.49]Because every time I get into a long conversation, we get in a big conversation.
[110:08.05]Like, what's your favorite fucking popsicle?
[110:11.37]Mine's definitely the one with the rocket with the red on the top.
[110:14.08]The red rocket with the white and the blue on it.
[110:17.62]I don't know.
[110:18.20]For some reason, they don't talk to me.
[110:21.67]What is this thing?
[110:25.83]What is this fucking device?
[110:36.61]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[110:37.19]Humans.
[110:38.43]Humans.
[110:38.85]Let's take a look.
[110:42.40]Anything else over here?
[110:45.18]Oh.
[110:45.46]Easy.
[110:46.60]Easy.
[110:50.47]There's something big behind this.
[110:52.15]I don't think I want to open this.
[110:54.47]Red rock.
[110:59.29]19.
[111:01.84]Was anybody else expecting it to say 18?
[111:03.26]17?
[111:03.28]16?
[111:03.38]I did.
[111:04.62]Alright, let's change gears.
[111:18.83]Oh, no.
[111:19.09]Okay, we're going down.
[111:27.95]What's down here?
[111:32.23]To recap.
[111:33.32]This is going to be a long puzzle that my brain's not going to be able to do.
[111:36.30]Just that I'm going to tell you right now.
[111:41.36]It's going to be a really long one.
[111:42.90]That I'm going to lose track of everything I'm doing.
[111:46.06]And not going to finish it.
[111:47.02]I'm not going to finish the game.
[111:47.80]This is like the end of the game probably.
[111:48.98]I have no idea what's going on.
[111:50.59]And I can't pull this.
[111:51.27]I'm not strong enough.
[111:53.51]Why did I think I was going to be able to fucking pull this?
[111:57.25]Nope.
[112:00.12]The play of the game with the matter is... I... Every time I get in a conversation, like a long one... Because you end up having the same... Here's the thing about dating.
[112:10.40]If you guys don't know anything about Tinder, especially.
[112:13.20]You end up having the same conversation.
[112:14.92]It's like Groundhog Day of dating.
[112:17.13]You have the exact same conversation with every single person you talk to.
[112:21.57]And it gets to a point where it gets kind of exhausting to ask.
[112:24.97]You lose track if you've asked this person where they work.
[112:29.23]And then sometimes you say like, oh, hey, where do you work?
[112:31.82]And they're like, oh, you just asked me that like three days ago.
[112:33.86]And I'm like, oh, fuck, sorry.
[112:34.74]There's like nine other people I've been talking to that I've said, I'm sorry.
[112:38.04]I'm going.
[112:43.21]Okay, well, I'm stuck down here now.
[112:54.74]I just swallowed my own words.
[112:55.81]There's the giant egg man that's down here.
[112:58.41]There's definitely an egg man.
[112:59.29]These guys are going to fucking swarm me.
[113:05.22]I don't know.
[113:05.72]Let's take a shower.
[113:07.00]These are like little shower checkpoints.
[113:15.76]No.
[113:16.58]No.
[113:16.92]That's drowning.
[113:18.50]That is drowning for sure.
[113:20.84]So let's not do that.
[113:21.82]Do I have to bring the fucking spaceship down here again?
[113:32.23]Can I get up there and... I could have raised the water or something.
[113:40.01]I don't know.
[113:41.53]I'm too scared to try to go down there.
[113:53.42]Was it worth it?
[113:55.32]It was worth it.
[113:56.40]What was over here?
[113:59.48]This is really a breathing checkpoint.
[114:05.67]Oh, shit.
[114:09.85]Please.
[114:10.51]Please.
[114:11.17]Please.
[114:15.95]Hey, Moose and Mills.
[114:17.29]Thanks for five months, Moose.
[114:19.17]And Mills.
[114:20.33]Thanks to both of you.
[114:21.83]There's probably two people on the account, obviously.
[114:23.60]There's an and in that name, but... Thank you for five years.
[114:26.24]It's five years.
[114:28.02]Alright.
[114:33.78]I'm gonna use my regular Nintendo experience playing Pitfall to be able to beat this part.
[114:44.59]There's some people that have like year-long, like more than one or two years on their subs.
[114:50.39]Like three years.
[114:51.55]Oh boy, please make this jump, you little fuck.
[114:55.08]Thank you.
[114:56.38]I'm just... Ooh!
[114:58.04]This is where I control them.
[115:02.24]Ah!
[115:04.06]Huh?
[115:06.14]What is going on?
[115:11.07]Ugh!
[115:12.25]Get the fuck away from me!
[115:15.85]Should I take him in the water?
[115:18.31]Was there anything?
[115:18.81]No, wait, no, no, no.
[115:19.55]The big giant machine.
[115:20.27]The big giant thing.
[115:21.49]Follow me, guys.
[115:25.38]You have two years to start?
[115:26.66]Damn.
[115:29.38]Can I get on their shoulders?
[115:31.00]Yeah, I can.
[115:33.02]Okay, cool.
[115:36.60]So now let's bring them over to the giant thing, right?
[115:44.28]Where is the giant thing?
[115:46.54]Was it over here?
[115:47.08]I don't remember where it was.
[115:50.26]Yeah, it is over there.
[115:50.84]I just gotta grab him.
[115:51.48]I gotta pick him up.
[115:53.75]Alright, fellas.
[115:56.29]Get over here.
[115:56.89]We have a big wheelbarrow full of dirt to move or something.
[116:00.87]I don't know.
[116:03.65]Brainless idiots.
[116:05.07]That guy's gonna get his head chopped off.
[116:06.37]Thank God.
[116:12.07]All of them are.
[116:14.73]Oliver!
[116:17.17]This is kind of like Pikmin.
[116:20.48]You've been subbed to me on YouTube since 400 subs.
[116:22.40]Does that mean anything?
[116:23.26]Oh, wow.
[116:24.30]That is... That is like an original.
[116:32.12]I don't know where to pull this to, but I'm going to assume... Somewhere over here.
[116:39.39]Maybe the giant hole with dirt coming down?
[116:45.27]I'm going to just assume it's right here.
[116:48.44]I'm curious if we move further.
[116:50.90]Yeah, okay.
[116:57.18]I can only move it over here.
[117:01.10]Right underneath where the dirt's coming.
[117:04.58]You can throw me onto the rope.
[117:08.76]Throw me up there, guys.
[117:11.20]Toss my little mushroom body up there, please.
[117:17.56]What the hell is that for?
[117:19.28]Uh... Huh.
[117:25.74]Does it go this way?
[117:33.44]Hey!
[117:34.88]Hey!
[117:36.26]Did you move it?
[117:36.80]You fucking idiots!
[117:37.60]Why did you move it?
[117:40.82]Oh my god, you dumb... You dummies!
[117:44.01]Grab it, please, and pull it back.
[117:47.85]Oh, you fucking idiots.
[117:49.35]Where are they?
[117:52.67]Do I have to get on top of it?
[117:56.28]You stupid assholes.
[117:57.32]Catch me.
[117:58.16]I command you to catch me.
[118:02.56]Okay, that's what... You ever seen like a video where people have spotters around like a trampoline or something?
[118:09.36]And that's what happens when somebody actually falls off a fucking trampoline.
[118:13.72]You try to catch the person and they just fall.
[118:16.00]It doesn't even matter.
[118:16.67]The person's always gonna fall.
[118:23.19]That, like, lame attempt that everybody does if somebody actually falls off something you're supposed to be spotting.
[118:28.33]That's how it happens.
[118:28.95]Let me get on top of it, and then they can push it.
[118:38.48]Let's see what the hell this is all for.
[118:42.58]I have not been playing Pokémon Go.
[118:44.78]I want to, though.
[118:47.42]Let's get on it.
[118:48.02]Alright, push me.
[118:52.47]This is a secret, I swear to God.
[118:53.71]I'm going to be fucking pissed about this.
[119:09.36]Get up!
[119:10.68]It wasn't that hard.
[119:15.84]If I get in the water, am I going to get zapped?
[119:19.16]Probably, right?
[119:19.76]I guess not.
[119:25.16]Going all the way this way.
[119:28.06]For... What exactly?
[119:37.65]Okay.
[119:40.19]This, apparently... This is making a lot of noise.
[119:45.91]Okay.
[119:46.15]Are you kidding me?
[119:49.56]That was so weak.
[120:02.21]What?
[120:02.45]I couldn't move with that on it?
[120:08.47]What if I just... What if I don't even stand on it?
[120:10.07]I can go up so much higher.
[120:15.31]Do I have to get this thing off my head?
[120:19.03]Is this thing weighing me down?
[120:31.00]Hold on.
[120:31.28]Wait a minute.
[120:31.60]Wait a minute.
[120:31.88]Wait a minute.
[120:32.16]Wait a minute.
[120:32.44]I think I got it.
[120:32.90]I think I got it.
[120:33.88]Watch this.
[120:38.46]Okay.
[120:40.26]Now we've successfully done that.
[120:41.64]Let's try this.
[120:50.99]Oh!
[120:53.15]Okay.
[120:53.53]We're fine.
[120:56.05]What are these guys for?
[120:59.94]Should I bring this?
[121:03.28]Let's bring this.
[121:07.78]When do you guys stand on this?
[121:16.27]No, don't do that.
[121:17.59]I want it so bad.
[121:18.73]I'm going to do it.
[121:19.89]I have to see it, right?
[121:21.89]What's the point of doing this?
[121:26.28]Oh, I really like your... Oh, wow.
[121:28.73]Lame.
[121:30.15]Lame.
[121:32.25]Let's go.
[121:32.57]We're gonna take our desk and we're gonna move.
[121:35.11]No, we're not.
[121:35.59]I'm kidding.
[121:36.01]Let's go.
[121:48.02]What a disappointment.
[121:48.80]I know, really.
[121:52.02]So I have to bring all these guys back?
[121:53.99]I don't understand where I'm bringing them back to.
[121:58.53]I guess they joined their little buddies over here?
[122:03.03]I've got a shitload of people.
[122:05.16]How fast are we going to pull this?
[122:08.64]Look at that.
[122:11.44]Look at how fast we can do this as we work together as a team.
[122:16.47]Let's go.
[122:17.17]Fucking dumbasses.
[122:21.37]Don't need to do that.
[122:22.01]Everyone's already up there.
[122:22.81]So let's just go back.
[122:29.50]There's nothing else I can do here, right?
[122:31.14]Unless I miss something, but whatever.
[122:32.44]Let's just take the other guy.
[122:33.16]I want to get rid of these guys.
[122:34.40]Let's go up to the elevator.
[122:45.29]Secret.
[122:45.67]I thought it was a secret.
[122:53.45]And...
[122:55.76]Oh, no.
[122:56.38]I think I'm right now.
[122:57.68]Oh, no.
[123:00.12]I'm just now figuring this all out.
[123:03.37]Great.
[123:05.11]So, I have to get, like, a bunch of these idiots to stand.
[123:09.67]They're going to follow me.
[123:10.59]This is not going to work.
[123:13.01]We're going to go up.
[123:18.15]I need 19 men.
[123:19.31]Are we going to go storm a castle?
[123:22.00]What the hell are we doing?
[123:30.93]Looks like such an idiot with this thing.
[123:34.19]Let's take a right.
[123:36.97]Let's take a right.
[123:43.24]Okay, ready?
[123:44.02]Throw me.
[123:46.02]How many of you guys would it take to throw me over there?
[123:49.50]Nice.
[123:50.06]Stay there.
[123:50.42]Don't move.
[123:51.20]They're not gonna.
[123:51.68]They're gonna.
[123:52.10]Okay, good.
[123:55.84]Alright, there's somebody here.
[123:56.64]19?
[123:56.66]Get up.
[124:01.93]You really can drag them?
[124:03.59]Wait, what's over here?
[124:08.89]Add this one to the pile.
[124:11.41]Add this one to the pile.
[124:13.02]I found one, guys.
[124:15.06]You're never going to... This is going to be funny.
[124:17.10]This is going to be a really funny bit.
[124:18.48]Watch this.
[124:18.84]Ready?
[124:21.48]Hey, fellas!
[124:23.08]You're never going to believe what I found over there!
[124:26.72]Oh, that wasn't that funny.
[124:28.46]I didn't know if I was going to just dump her.
[124:30.10]Okay.
[124:30.95]Catch me.
[124:37.16]What a funny bit that was.
[124:38.44]I didn't expect her to drop.
[124:46.87]I need ten, like, nine more?
[124:48.25]Eight more?
[124:51.41]There ain't... There ain't fucking nine people.
[124:54.85]I gotta go down.
[124:55.87]Ugh, this is so horrible.
[124:58.80]I don't want to do this.
[125:01.00]Bye.
[125:03.82]Those people are dead.
[125:10.54]I'll go down and get them.
[125:16.41]Everybody on.
[125:16.99]They were even grabbing on to another supposed to be brainless.
[125:25.19]They were trying to hold on.
[125:29.57]Little ding it makes.
[125:33.18]Mmm, alright.
[125:34.22]How many bodies are down here?
[125:36.76]I need, what, eight?
[125:38.52]One, two... I don't really have to drag.
[125:40.71]Thank God.
[125:41.17]If I had to come back and drag all these idiots.
[125:44.55]Now I have enough strength to open up this door.
[125:50.39]You had a haircut and you came back to see me throw a body off a cliff?
[125:53.04]Yeah.
[125:56.64]There's just one guy over here.
[125:57.64]I hope it's like five.
[126:00.32]How many people are in here?
[126:04.37]Just one.
[126:05.17]Add him to the group.
[126:08.43]Okay.
[126:10.15]There's two more over there.
[126:11.17]Alright, you guys know what to do.
[126:13.60]Throw me.
[126:17.06]Ooh, yeah.
[126:18.14]Pull it.
[126:21.90]Have fun on the ride.
[126:23.04]What the fuck?
[126:29.01]Alright, get out.
[126:30.23]Get out.
[126:31.71]No, get out.
[126:34.81]Oh, my God.
[126:36.89]Um... Get out!
[126:43.49]How do I get them to get the fuck out?
[126:49.22]Get out of the ship!
[126:50.30]Get out of the box!
[126:53.46]I'm gonna just give them whiplash.
[126:59.31]Maybe... Will they just, like, climb over?
[127:01.23]Oh, no.
[127:01.81]Oh, thank God.
[127:02.69]Alright, get down.
[127:08.92]I seriously have to, like, throw them up there myself, don't I?
[127:15.26]Okay, let's go.
[127:16.04]I'm gonna just seesaw these fucking idiots.
[127:23.41]You ready to get seesawed?
[127:24.47]Ah, I almost had it.
[127:31.95]Here we go, and...
[127:37.93]Get over there!
[127:39.63]Oh, just barely.
[127:45.07]Any more down here?
[127:46.23]Is that all of them?
[127:54.94]I did it.
[127:56.22]I Einstein'd that.
[127:57.06]Alright, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[128:00.12]I got it.
[128:00.74]I got enough.
[128:01.14]Make it over here.
[128:10.44]Physics 101.
[128:13.61]Professor Jerma speaking.
[128:16.03]I never professed to be a physics professor.
[128:22.49]Look at all these guys.
[128:23.29]Am I about to sacrifice these all?
[128:29.36]Is one not wearing pants?
[128:31.96]I think two of them don't have pants on.
[128:38.59]Alright.
[128:40.91]Let's go.
[128:41.39]No, don't grab me.

[131:33.41]I know what I have to do, but I don't get it.
[131:35.47]It's like that, right?
[131:36.47]Because it's got to be on the top.

[132:25.31]Can I make it up the ladder the whole way?
[132:26.79]I don't think I can make it up the ladder.
[132:32.68]I don't think I can make it up the ladder and get to that point.
[132:34.70]Let's see how far I can get up here.
[132:35.64]Okay, so it has to be there.
[132:42.52]Huh.
[132:46.49]So, it's gotta stop here.
[132:48.95]Because otherwise I can't even physically... No.
[132:51.23]I'm a fucking dumbass.
[132:52.15]Why did I grab that?
[133:00.78]So, I have to do it here.

[134:14.83]Like, right here?

[135:39.69]I froze the fuck up right there.
[135:41.33]Okay, that's how you do it, but I just froze.
[135:42.95]The music changed.
[135:46.67]I know I'm safe on this one, and I just gotta follow it up.
[135:52.42]That's not safe.
[135:53.30]I'm not safe here.
[135:53.84]I'm not safe.
[135:55.18]I'm not safe!
[136:00.30]It's right there.
[136:01.20]I gotta go a little bit further.
[136:04.66]Like, here.

[137:55.17]Okay, let's keep moving.
[138:03.00]Shit's just flying.
[138:04.58]All the test dummies.
[138:09.61]Hold on.
[138:10.59]I'm gonna fall here.
[138:14.78]Oh, wait!
[138:15.16]What happened?
[138:15.66]I was looking at chat!
[138:19.00]I was looking at chat.
[138:20.32]I thought I was safe.
[138:21.04]What happened?
[138:21.98]I don't know what happened.
[138:22.70]All I saw was I was gone.
[138:24.24]When I turned back to look at the screen, I was not on it.
[138:27.93]What happened?
[138:31.81]I don't get it.
[138:32.49]What did I do wrong?
[138:38.55]What, I don't, what happened?
[138:39.77]Does anybody know what happened?
[138:40.57]I don't know what happened.
[138:45.30]I don't get it.
[138:46.66]Whatever.
[138:47.90]Okay.

[139:47.05]How fast do I gotta go?
[139:48.03]Should I grab?
[139:53.14]I don't know.
[139:53.68]I gotta stop.
[139:54.30]I know what I gotta do!

[140:21.46]Yeah!
[140:23.08]That's how you get away from the shockwaves, guys.
[140:26.36]It's that easy.
[140:29.22]And no more shockwaves?
[140:31.30]I don't think so.
[140:32.38]No more shockwaves.
[140:37.32]Very cool.
[140:38.48]Oh, this is end of the game music, guys.
[140:40.74]I can hear it.
[140:41.22]Can't you tell this is end of the game?
[140:44.48]I'm choking from laughing.
[140:51.02]Here we go.
[140:51.28]This is where I'm going to find out my father's behind it all.
[141:00.95]It's not going to dunk me, is it?
[141:11.73]Am I dead?
[141:12.17]The shockwaves are still happening.
[141:14.81]Jesus.
[141:15.23]I'm bouncing around in here.
[141:17.59]Should I grab something?
[141:19.90]I don't know what to do.
[141:20.50]Should I grab?
[141:22.81]Get out!

[143:29.81]Yeah, I probably did.
[143:32.61]Alright, well, let's keep going.
[143:38.85]Obviously, I have to go down.
[143:48.22]Ladder hatch.
[143:52.54]Two things to pull.
[143:53.34]Let's go to the left one first.
[143:54.50]And...
[144:03.76]Okay.
[144:04.42]Is it gonna give me, like, the tongue?
[144:05.64]I get it, I get it.
[144:08.86]That button's gonna make the tongue come out.
[144:10.82]And I get on the tongue.
[144:12.72]Easy.
[144:18.88]That was very fast.
[144:20.92]That was faster than I would ever imagine that happening.
[144:25.33]It just stuck its tongue out at me.
[144:26.67]Once I hold it.
[144:33.11]What the fuck did I do wrong, then?
[144:38.86]Oh, wait a second.
[144:41.64]Wait a second.
[144:43.14]Okay.
[144:44.44]Okay, game.

[144:47.66]I get ya.
[144:48.68]Hold on.
[144:50.26]So, I gotta do that one first.
[144:52.03]Do that one after, like, three seconds?
[144:53.57]Here we go.
[144:54.05]So, pull this one.
[144:55.49]One, two, three.
[144:57.73]Get on it.
[144:59.01]Press the button.
[145:07.13]Here we go.
[145:10.21]Let me make sure there's nothing over here.
[145:17.30]Oh, there is something over here.
[145:19.04]It's one of those weird boo people.
[145:23.45]Get me in there.
[145:23.97]Scratch it up.
[145:26.15]What's connected?
[145:26.69]Is that electricity?
[145:34.48]Puzzle solving extraordinaire.
[145:36.18]What a genius.
[145:39.84]If I couldn't tell it, I could sense a little bit of sarcasm on you, chat.
[145:48.35]There's a ledge.
[145:49.15]You all saw it.
[145:49.71]It looked like it could have been a secret.
[145:58.85]Alright, where's dad?
[145:59.75]Dad?
[146:00.17]Dad, why'd you do all these experiments to people?
[146:03.09]Why'd you do it?
[146:05.30]Come on.
[146:06.10]Give me the anime ending.
[146:09.58]Oh, fuck.
[146:13.18]What do I do here?
[146:13.65]I'm gonna drown.
[146:16.05]What do I do here?
[146:16.95]I'm gonna drown.
[146:18.41]What the fuck do I do?
[146:19.61]God.
[146:20.03]I figured it out.
[146:28.48]Don't worry.
[146:31.94]Is there a hatch right there?
[146:32.76]I can't tell...
[146:37.29]Give me the book ending.
[146:43.41]This will be fun.
[146:54.32]I was just so nonchalant right there.
[146:56.00]Okay, so you can grab your legs.
[147:03.77]Confirmed.
[147:04.23]She can grab your legs.
[147:05.05]Oh, wait.
[147:05.31]How scary this was.
[147:06.07]Oh, fuck.
[147:06.75]Whoa.
[147:07.07]She almost got me.
[147:08.73]She almost got me.
[147:14.47]Trying to get as far away from her as I can.
[147:26.94]Yeah, you just gotta keep getting far away from her.
[147:29.49]Stay away from me.
[147:32.70]Wait, wait, wait, there's a ladder.
[147:34.76]There's a ladder.
[147:36.76]But, there could be a secret on the right.
[147:40.14]What should I do, guys?
[147:42.24]Judging by, okay, so no as I go up, yes as I go to the secret to the right.
[147:46.41]I'm gonna, just by judging by what I see in chat, just blow it a yes or no.
[147:50.03]Yes as go, no as up.
[147:52.97]The first explosion in chat that I see, like, how many yeses or noes I see is what I'm gonna do.
[147:58.55]Like, the first fucking screen.
[148:04.65]Okay, it's not like five yeses.
[148:05.79]We're going.
[148:13.68]That's a room.
[148:14.60]We're going in that room.
[148:18.96]Hey.
[148:20.18]Easy L Club.
[148:21.56]Easel Club.
[148:23.04]Easel Cube, maybe.
[148:24.20]Thanks for three months.
[148:25.44]Hopefully I'm saying your name right.
[148:29.30]Thank you, dude.
[148:29.86]Welcome back.
[148:31.13]That is a room, though.
[148:31.81]I'm going in that room.
[148:32.89]You guys were right to have me do it.
[148:37.84]They're gonna be faster, though.
[148:42.04]This might take me a couple of attempts, guys.
[148:43.57]I apologize in advance.
[148:49.33]Otto, what are you doing?
[148:57.39]Secret underwater lake.
[148:58.38]Can I jump from here?
[149:01.48]What gives me more air?
[149:03.14]Running and jumping from there?
[149:05.02]I'm going to assume it's just like the elephant in the room.
[149:08.10]What do you mean by that?
[149:09.34]What's the saying?
[149:12.01]Yeah, that's definitely how you do it.
[149:13.03]Because you need the air to drop down further and faster.
[149:15.19]And hopefully she doesn't fucking get me.
[149:17.67]She fucking got me.
[149:18.97]She got me.
[149:19.85]She got me.
[149:21.77]She caught me.
[149:22.63]She still got me.
[149:23.15]I'll try it again.
[149:30.46]She's gonna get me again.
[149:31.38]Can I close the door?
[149:32.88]Grab the door.
[149:33.86]Grab the door!
[149:34.62]Fuck, we're done.
[149:37.38]I can't grab the door.
[149:38.62]One more time.
[149:42.52]Grab the door.
[149:43.64]I gotta be able to pull the door shut.
[149:48.99]Yeah, fuck that.
[149:50.91]We're done.
[149:53.85]Higher ladder?
[149:54.53]Yeah, maybe I can jump from this ladder.
[149:59.18]Okay, well hey fellas turns out the entire time I was supposed to come up here and jump down Hey, should I go this way yes or no hey both times it doesn't matter if you're going to go this way no matter what okay?
[150:19.40]That's so funny.
[150:21.30]That's so fucking fun.
[150:33.62]Oh, that gives me gas.
[150:35.34]That gives me gas.
[150:36.96]How do I get out of here?
[150:37.86]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[150:44.34]Press the button?
[150:44.90]What does that do?
[150:49.88]Water raising?
[150:51.68]Oh, no.
[150:51.98]The chain's moving.
[150:53.64]Okay, let's ride the chain.
[151:03.09]This seemed quite pointless.
[151:14.89]Is there something I can hook over here?
[151:18.49]I would assume there's got to be something I can grab and hook.
[151:24.03]Ninja Warrior!
[151:25.10]What about this plank?
[151:30.98]Don't tell me there's something I have to go get down at the bottom of the ocean or something.
[151:33.90]I'm just going to take a look.
[151:37.44]I just want to make sure I'm not missing something down here.
[151:43.93]There's a lady down here that fucking grabs you and starts choking you.
[151:51.01]Should I grab her?
[151:52.55]Like hook her?
[151:53.25]I wonder.
[151:56.61]What else is over here?
[152:04.09]Just keep going that way.
[152:08.67]Just out of curiosity, there's a button here.
[152:11.03]She's going to grab me, but I'm assuming this is the water.
[152:16.44]She's killed me so many times.
[152:21.92]Thankfully, I keep starting here.
[152:29.02]Can I bring her all the way back to the left?
[152:31.08]I wonder.
[152:38.03]Can I lure her over here?
[152:39.25]Will she try to grab me?
[152:40.19]Can I just put her on?
[152:43.39]Oh, shit.
[152:44.53]Come up here.
[152:44.91]Come on.
[152:45.89]Grab the hook!
[152:46.57]Fuck!
[152:47.91]I thought I could reach up and grab it.
[152:51.24]I thought I could grab that chain.
[153:07.07]Oh shit!
[153:07.63]Fuck.
[153:11.63]Fuck.
[153:16.19]I didn't mean to do that.
[153:17.06]I just fell right in.
[153:17.94]I was like at the zoo when they throw the fucking chicken to the alligators.
[153:32.93]It definitely has to do with her and the hook.
[153:34.95]So we're gonna go like this.
[153:37.39]Is she here?
[153:39.19]Where is she?
[153:39.69]There she is.
[153:40.05]Easy, easy, easy.
[153:42.69]Now what?
[153:45.05]Go!
[153:49.73]Okay.
[153:53.53]Does that give me an opportunity to run?
[153:57.07]Can I keep going?
[153:58.35]How far away is she?
[154:03.75]I mean, she's pretty fucking far away.
[154:06.05]Why did it not... Why did the button not open?
[154:08.31]Why did the button do that?
[154:09.77]Why did the button... Why did the button... That's what you do.
[154:12.71]Why did the button... Why did it press a second time?
[154:16.03]I didn't press it a second time.
[154:17.95]I didn't.
[154:18.63]I just didn't.
[154:19.31]I know I didn't.
[154:20.03]I know what I didn't.
[154:20.63]I know what I didn't do.
[154:21.43]I didn't do that.
[154:25.24]God.
[154:31.70]Why did the button do that?
[154:34.84]Fucking game.
[154:43.39]Okay, calm.
[154:43.95]This is gonna happen right now.
[154:47.55]I just slipped off.
[154:48.45]There's like kerosene all over that thing.
[154:50.88]That's why I slipped off.
[154:51.82]It's all greasy.
[155:03.41]Don't fall off.
[155:05.57]Do not fall off.
[155:07.25]Dip your toes in the water.
[155:08.35]Here she comes.
[155:12.66]This is so scary.
[155:13.56]She's going to grab my feet.
[155:14.54]Okay.
[155:25.38]Slowly but surely, let's do it again.
[155:27.79]This time the button.
[155:28.83]Do not fuck me over button, please.
[155:31.01]I would appreciate it.
[155:34.21]Press it once.
[155:36.37]I didn't think it pressed.
[155:39.35]It pressed.
[155:41.00]You saw it light up again.
[155:41.98]I thought it didn't press.
[155:42.68]This game is giving me heart problems.
[155:54.43]Okay, it's gonna fall.
[155:57.21]Grab the cord.
[156:12.15]Almost, almost, almost.
[156:15.18]I hope this, you wish this is a secret.
[156:17.06]This is going to be all for nothing.
[156:18.72]No, the giant vault door is here.
[156:20.08]This is where all the money is stored.
[156:26.06]Open.
[156:29.59]No, yeah, yeah, of course.
[156:30.85]She's still here.
[156:34.94]Am I done with her forever?
[156:35.86]I hope so.
[156:36.48]I really don't want to do that again.
[156:37.56]That was so stressful and awful.
[156:43.10]I'm gonna have to do it again.
[156:43.92]I guarantee you.
[156:46.56]Yeah.
[156:47.64]She's gonna be, like, right here.
[156:48.68]Hold on.
[156:51.52]I need to lower back over.
[156:52.50]Wait, is she even over here?
[156:54.83]Is she here?
[156:55.19]I don't know.
[156:55.89]I'm, like, I'm fucking scared to go down here.
[157:01.13]Okay.
[157:01.51]Yeah, she is.
[157:01.93]But we're gonna have to change.
[157:03.65]Get
[157:05.44]Come over here.
[157:08.28]The vault just had more water.
[157:09.46]Yeah, I know.
[157:11.32]What else is new?
[157:13.26]Blow her back this way and then swim underneath.
[157:15.16]I know what I'm doing.
[157:19.07]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[157:24.89]In we go.
[157:28.15]Did I already press this?
[157:28.79]I gotta press it again, right?
[157:31.17]Don't squish me.
[157:44.51]Now what it's bought over here And another chain, I don't think there's leads up here I
[158:00.23]Oh, come on, really?
[158:01.73]Are you serious?
[158:04.95]How do I get her off?
[158:05.81]Okay, this is like a cutscene, so this is supposed to happen.
[158:09.15]Yeah, this is a cutscene.
[158:13.75]Okay, I'm just going to let the cutscene happen.
[158:24.74]Okay.
[158:25.00]There's going to be more to this cutscene.
[158:26.22]I'm going to assume this is part of the game's...
[158:33.51]Okay.
[158:39.33]That's happened to me like five times.
[158:41.65]Why would that be?
[158:43.61]Why would that matter?
[158:51.19]How is this one any different?
[158:54.81]She just plugged me in.
[159:00.36]What, I have this giant like fucking wall Jack on my body?
[159:05.37]Is this showing me what happens when they do grab me and pull me down here?
[159:13.28]Are fish gonna start eating me?
[159:20.92]What was that?
[159:25.58]Why is this like an extended death scene?
[159:28.02]Is that the fuck?
[159:33.67]What the hell is this?
[159:35.94]I'm just getting, like, fish food.
[159:40.80]I don't... This is dumb.
[159:54.17]Who is this guy?
[159:58.65]I'm awake.
[159:59.05]I'm alive.
[159:59.43]That wasn't the end.
[160:03.00]Okay, I can swim.
[160:03.82]Should I swim to the giant cloaked monster?
[160:07.80]So now I have breathing forever?
[160:10.04]I'm confused.
[160:14.00]I guess I can breathe forever.
[160:18.80]Maybe I should look down here.
[160:22.40]So that wasn't the end.
[160:26.22]What the hell is that thing?
[160:27.08]Oh.
[160:36.82]Secret?
[160:38.32]Maybe there's a secret over here.
[160:42.26]Do I have to suck up a bunch of fish into a woodcutter again?
[160:44.35]No, that's a wall.
[160:51.87]Doesn't look like anything's over here.
[160:58.95]Okay, thanks for giving me breathing underwater.
[161:01.41]You couldn't have given me like 200% more swim speed?
[161:08.11]You gave me one side of the equation there.
[161:09.71]It's just gonna go up.
[161:18.52]She was trying to save me the entire time.
[161:21.24]Oh, she has a weird way of going about doing it.
[161:22.94]Okay.
[161:31.67]Uh, this looks like a hospital bed.
[161:34.91]Hospital.
[161:42.28]I'm just part of the aquarium now.
[161:43.54]That's good.
[161:46.14]What's through this door?
[161:54.06]Light.
[161:55.96]Some more debris.
[162:01.98]She wanted to ask about my work.
[162:04.74]I've said it too many times.
[162:11.38]Whoa, big, big area.
[162:14.23]I don't know if I should go up or down here.
[162:19.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[162:22.09]I'm like freaking out in the water.
[162:23.73]Get these fish out of here.
[162:25.80]Get out of here, fish.
[162:30.78]What was the thing making the Sonic boom?
[162:33.14]Does it ever explain that?
[162:33.94]Let's see.
[162:40.68]Another door.
[162:42.60]This door looks like it's breathing.
[162:50.85]Do I still get to stay alive because she kissed me?
[162:57.17]I knew that was gonna happen.
[162:58.09]I just wanted to see it happen.
[162:59.24]You know what I mean?
[163:01.50]Like that was just like me trying to be funny.
[163:03.90]Haha.
[163:08.68]Yeah, you're going to put me into the fan.
[163:10.14]I know it.
[163:10.68]It's going to turn on.
[163:11.32]That's why I'm grabbing the straps.
[163:13.32]Let's see.
[163:14.38]Okay.
[163:17.28]Yeah, that's what it does.
[163:19.12]Just wanted to know.
[163:19.80]I needed to be sure.
[163:20.48]This is a sphincter door.
[163:29.97]Oh, man.
[163:30.81]Hold on.
[163:32.27]It's a twister.
[163:35.25]Oh, I almost let go.
[163:39.43]Didn't this happen in the movie Twister?
[163:42.14]The eye of the tornado comes over and she's like holding on to a thing like this.
[163:45.54]Oh, fuck.
[163:46.12]Oh, I know where I'm going.
[163:55.30]Uh, secret.
[163:59.23]Definitely a secret up here.
[164:09.04]I wish I could go faster than this.
[164:13.36]I can hear rats.
[164:14.72]Nice, I can hear rats.
[164:16.60]Oh, I just tripped.
[164:20.51]You missed the secret.
[164:22.37]Did I miss the secret?
[164:23.87]I missed the secret, didn't I?
[164:26.69]I gotta get that secret.
[164:31.05]Fuck.
[164:34.13]I didn't expect that.
[164:35.73]Let's go get the secret.
[164:41.04]Let's go get that secret.
[164:43.98]Wait, where am I?
[164:46.16]Did I just find another secret?
[164:50.10]Yeah, I just found another secret.
[164:51.64]Trying to go back to find the first secret.
[164:53.18]I found another secret.
[164:59.19]Right?
[165:00.95]I wasn't supposed to go this way.
[165:01.91]Okay.
[165:06.89]Okay.
[165:09.34]Told you.
[165:10.96]Found it.
[165:11.28]Mmm.
[165:15.72]Accidentally found a secret, didn't I?
[165:20.52]How do I get it?
[165:20.96]What the fuck?
[165:26.46]How do I get that?
[165:26.96]Do you want anything about this?
[165:33.78]How do I get this?
[165:37.04]Ah.
[165:39.41]Oh, look at that.
[165:41.41]I'm just making noises to make it seem like I know what's going on.
[165:47.43]I found part of the next... No.
[165:49.46]Bye.
[165:51.22]Forget about that secret.
[165:52.06]We don't care about that one.
[165:53.72]That one's lame.
[165:56.20]We care about, like, the fucking real hardcore punk bass secrets.
[165:59.92]You know what I mean?
[166:01.32]That's not one of them.
[166:07.61]I'm part of like the original hardcore punk scene.
[166:10.14]You know what I'm saying?
[166:10.76]That's what I'm talking about.
[166:11.66]Like punk bass.
[166:21.26]Just go under.
[166:21.90]I can't go under.
[166:22.42]It's too fucking shallow.
[166:23.46]I bet you have to drop down on it.
[166:26.60]Probably, but I don't want to do that.
[166:31.84]I just want to get to the end where my father takes the plug out.
[166:35.41]He's trying to trash the plug over here, son.
[166:39.47]I've been controlling the... Forgot about the fans.
[166:48.51]Good thing I'm fucking smarter than a fifth grader.
[166:55.63]I hope there's another one.
[166:58.12]I don't see another one.
[167:01.37]Oh dear!
[167:10.37]Shit. Do I actually have to go this way?
[167:23.37]Ow! Ow my face!
[167:29.91]Let's go.
[167:31.49]You can't get me out of this thing.
[167:32.79]It's a platform.
[167:36.59]These guts.
[167:40.18]They got shot and shot me right in the guts.
[167:50.58]Shit.
[167:51.58]Get on the ladder.
[167:52.36]Get on the ladder before this, before you get piled and fried.
[168:01.19]I forgot to do this.
[168:01.83]I forgot to do the triggers.
[168:02.75]There's another one.
[168:05.96]I have to come forward and back, forward and back, forward and back.
[168:08.14]I already... No.
[168:09.06]No, no.
[168:09.38]That's too... What the fuck do I do here?
[168:16.28]Okay.
[168:19.56]Oh.
[168:20.04]Fire in the... Cigar.
[168:25.53]Grabbed.
[168:31.32]This is too stressful.
[168:32.36]I don't like this.
[168:33.82]I don't like it.
[168:34.42]Get up to 12 o'clock.
[168:39.51]I'll be happy at 12 o'clock.
[168:40.47]Nah, that's not 12.
[168:41.73]Hey!
[168:47.75]Okay, this is like 2.30.
[168:50.01]2.30, got it.
[168:52.73]Oh!
[168:54.19]I'm sorry.
[168:54.61]I probably scared the shit out of everybody.
[168:56.78]But it scared the shit out of me because I thought I was getting grabbed.
[169:09.21]Is that enough?
[169:12.07]What am I doing here?
[169:13.63]What is this supposed to do?
[169:17.33]Jump from that to the... I guess, but then what the fuck do I do?
[169:25.92]Oh, I think I figured out what you do.
[169:30.09]Until it goes a second time.
[169:35.83]Shadow moves, that's the one tricky part.
[169:37.69]I'm gonna be looking at chat or something and die.
[169:40.41]And we're good.
[169:53.70]Can I make it?
[169:55.20]Isn't this an old joke from, like, the 30s?
[169:58.06]You put, like, a tiny little pool that the guy's supposed to jump where he climbs up the ladder and, like, 50 foot down, right?
[170:03.62]And usually, like, a small glass of water.
[170:05.12]That was in, like, Rocko's Modern Life.
[170:06.42]Was that in Rocko's Modern Life?
[170:10.56]Made it.
[170:13.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[170:14.54]What am I thinking?
[170:15.14]What are you doing?
[170:17.06]The obvious solution is always the right one.
[170:19.81]You're not gonna peek your head up and get any water.
[170:21.55]And any, any, any air?
[170:30.84]Huh.
[170:34.04]Okay.
[170:36.28]How does this game compare to ToeJam & Earl?
[170:37.67]Well, ToeJam & Earl is the best game ever made.
[170:40.25]Ever fucking made.
[170:41.09]So it's like... Oh, fuck.
[170:43.23]I didn't want to do that.
[170:43.95]I really didn't.
[170:44.49]I was too busy talking.
[170:46.37]And I closed the hole.
[170:47.21]What the hell am I doing down here?
[170:48.31]Where is this?
[170:52.82]That secret at the bottom of the bottom.
[170:54.22]Secret, secret, secret.
[170:55.54]Whatever.
[170:56.00]Right now we're in explore mode and I have no idea where I'm going.
[171:01.08]Just walking right.
[171:01.88]Don't care.
[171:05.30]Yeah.
[171:05.74]Here's my secret.
[171:07.10]Getting to the end of the fucking video game.
[171:08.74]You know what I'm saying?
[171:10.72]Oh, fuck.
[171:20.57]But wait a minute.
[171:21.07]How do I...
[171:24.10]If I'm standing here, and it goes up there, how do I get it to go up there after it goes up there?
[171:28.90]I feel like that's part of this.
[171:39.94]I feel like that's part of this.
[171:47.95]Oh shit, okay, oops.
[171:50.36]It was part of it.
[171:51.46]I knew it was part of it.
[171:52.58]I told you guys, I knew it.
[172:00.83]Now what?
[172:03.21]How do I get it?
[172:03.71]Fuck.
[172:07.73]Alright, it's gonna get up there, right?
[172:19.10]Um... Uh... Um... I don't know.
[172:25.78]Oh, do I know?
[172:26.58]Do I know?
[172:27.11]I don't think I know.
[172:29.57]No, I don't think I know.
[172:36.87]Don't think so.
[172:37.45]Okay.
[172:53.01]Hypothesis.
[172:53.61]Let's see what happens here.
[172:54.79]I'm just curious.
[173:01.87]Ah!
[173:02.21]You've done it.
[173:04.91]What a fucking Einstein.
[173:09.64]I'm gonna catch it when it gets up here.
[173:12.02]Ready?
[173:12.18]Here it comes.
[173:14.08]Come on!
[173:18.96]Urge to emote only mode rising.
[173:23.00]Why, what's wrong?
[173:24.16]People being mean?
[173:28.41]Okay, so obviously that goes up there and I close the door.
[173:31.05]Obviously.
[173:31.67]Corn in the sky.
[173:44.01]Thanks a lot, Corn in the Sky.
[173:44.97]Welcome to the channel.
[173:46.13]I always say welcome to the channel.
[173:48.13]Corn in the Sky could have been here for like six months.
[173:51.77]Anyways, welcome to the subscription team.
[173:57.13]The team of people that are subscribed.
[173:58.53]The Amigos.
[174:05.97]But regardless, thank you.
[174:08.84]Now that should be here, right?
[174:12.75]Yeah, I've never been here before.
[174:13.87]Oh, well then.
[174:15.17]Welcome.
[174:15.71]Thanks for showing up.
[174:19.73]We're a team now?
[174:20.35]Yeah, we're a team.
[174:21.73]We're a team of fucking... degenerates.
[174:28.85]Those VHS tapes, they kind of look like it.
[174:31.79]Alright.
[174:32.39]So, me bringing this up here, what the hell did I... What is that for?
[174:35.85]Let's go all the way to the right.
[174:38.95]Man, I wonder how much... I wonder how many petabytes these hard drives have.
[174:45.88]Oh, dude, I bet you there's like 60 petabytes in these hard drives.
[174:51.00]Oh, is this where they house the World of Warcraft servers?
[174:53.65]I think so.
[174:54.17]Okay, obviously there's a button there.
[175:02.85]So, one of them has to go over there.
[175:04.09]I've got to press that button, but... This is the next step.
[175:11.29]How far does this go?
[175:14.35]Let's see.
[175:16.23]You actually got a full Jupiter.
[175:17.51]How the fuck did you pull that off?
[175:23.11]Alright, hold on.
[175:23.71]Hear me out here.
[175:24.77]Hear me out.
[175:25.67]What if?
[175:26.29]I'm just curious.
[175:27.10]What if?
[175:29.86]Hear me out.
[175:33.06]I'm doing a double fucking double jump.
[175:36.14]Told ya!
[175:36.52]Ugh.
[175:47.53]What did that do?
[175:49.41]I released the valve.
[175:52.25]And there's the... Those are all the ghosts from the Ghostbusters movie.
[175:57.49]Make sure that doesn't break.
[175:59.69]They're all in there.
[176:03.97]Oh, fuck!
[176:06.23]The reverse gravity!
[176:08.77]The reverse... I thought I could just slide down there.
[176:21.99]Wait, what?
[176:23.71]I spent 25 bucks on you?
[176:25.29]Oh, God.
[176:25.80]Well, thanks, Chase.
[176:27.24]Five months in a row.
[176:28.06]Appreciate it, dude.
[176:29.20]Don't do that again.
[176:30.84]No!
[176:31.24]I was trying to just... Everybody's gonna think I'm such an idiot.
[176:35.62]I'm gonna see so many fucking failfishes in the chat.
[176:38.18]I'm gonna be like, stop that.
[176:39.80]Stop it.
[176:40.12]And it's gonna get like... I'm gonna fucking start like getting shaking and... I'm gonna be like, my face is gonna get red and I'm gonna be like, stop saying that.
[176:46.63]Stop fucking saying that about me.
[176:50.25]Obviously gotta go this way.
[176:51.95]Because I can't even do that.
[177:00.58]There's another one.
[177:03.76]I'm looking over right now and I said, stop saying that about me.
[177:06.74]Stop saying that about me.
[177:11.86]Can I grab that?
[177:13.66]Can I float down to the surface?
[177:15.02]Oh no, I can go in it.
[177:16.80]Do I want to go in it?
[177:17.79]Is the question.
[177:18.23]Because it looks like this guy is getting sucked over there.
[177:20.23]I guess so.
[177:24.93]What's in here?
[177:25.45]I need an Orson Welles emote.
[177:35.48]Yeah, I actually just figured out today that I have more emotes I can do.
[177:39.04]I'm just such a piece of crap.
[177:48.79]No, I'm a real piece of crap, guys.
[177:50.57]I'm sorry.
[177:50.93]I hate to... I mean, I have played Metal Gear Solid 2 before, though.
[177:56.16]Not many people can say that.
[177:57.16]Okay, it's in the cage with people in it.
[178:03.00]What's the number this time?
[178:12.25]Well, I came all the way back here for this.
[178:14.49]Hopefully it was worth it.
[178:18.18]Ah, Etalyx who got denied.
[178:20.22]Denied hard.
[178:25.62]Huh.
[178:29.22]Easy.
[178:30.98]There's another little boy.
[178:31.80]There's another little boy.
[178:33.06]On this Professor Farnsworth!
[178:39.05]Good news, everyone.
[178:40.75]I've created a device that will turn these humans into total brainless zombies.
[178:49.16]And that's Fry.
[178:49.96]That's Fry.
[178:51.78]Professor, what are you talking about?
[178:53.04]Fry!
[178:53.78]There he goes.
[178:54.30]Oh, and that's little Fry.
[178:57.15]Let's go.
[179:08.87]Can I answer the phone?
[179:16.33]Okay, I can climb up.
[179:17.89]There's a button to press.
[179:21.41]There's no sound anymore.
[179:25.05]Oh, I'm underwater.
[179:26.32]I guess that makes sense.
[179:27.08]Let's bring it all the way down.
[179:35.22]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[179:36.80]What is happening right now?
[179:39.67]What the fuck?
[179:44.23]Why are we upside down?
[179:47.37]I'm so confused.
[179:48.77]I really am.
[179:51.79]I mean, the theory, I guess, is I can... I swim up, am I gonna fall up?
[180:02.90]Okay.
[180:04.40]Why is there like two different waters?
[180:09.19]Like the first layer of water and then the second layer of water.
[180:12.27]I don't get it.
[180:12.74]I mean, does it have to go over here?
[180:18.66]I don't know.
[180:19.68]Whatever.
[180:19.94]Let's just see what happens.
[180:27.43]No, it's got to go up.
[180:34.97]I guess I got to push it.
[180:42.15]I guess... I don't... Hold on.
[180:52.12]Some vegetable oil?
[180:56.50]Can I try to get... I'm assuming I have to get it through the door?
[181:05.29]No.
[181:05.95]No.
[181:06.31]I... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[181:08.19]I know, I know.
[181:08.83]I think I fucked myself royally.
[181:10.97]Can I move it?
[181:11.59]Yeah.
[181:13.02]I have to jump on it.
[181:13.82]I get it.
[181:14.98]Bring the water down enough where I can jump.
[181:17.60]Like right there.
[181:23.80]Think with portals?
[181:24.56]I'm trying.
[181:25.00]This will come down.
[181:30.05]And then I should be able to... The door will open, right?
[181:33.53]Okay.
[181:35.99]Is this gonna land on my fucking head?
[181:40.33]Of course it is.
[181:43.68]Oh, this hurts my head.
[181:44.76]I don't... I'm so close, but I'm so far away.
[181:50.60]It's right here.
[181:53.80]Shit.
[181:58.91]Shit, I'm so close.
[182:09.88]It's this, like, second layer of water.
[182:11.30]It's just freaking me out.
[182:17.92]It's gotta be right there, but... Shit.
[182:22.50]I know it's gotta be here, but it's gotta fall, but...
[182:38.57]What about over... Can I like... Let me just look up here for a second.
[182:46.36]Hold on.
[182:47.50]I can't swim in this, right?
[182:48.52]This is anti-gravity mineral oil water.
[182:53.09]Let's get it back up there.
[182:55.03]I thought I was going to die.
[183:01.22]We drop the water and all that's left is the oil.
[183:04.23]And everybody knows that cubes don't float in oil.
[183:11.33]And people do.
[183:12.71]You know, because oil and water don't mix.
[183:14.05]You understand?
[183:14.49]Hold on.
[183:28.44]What happens if I put it here?
[183:32.94]Also called air.
[183:43.49]Now what happens?
[183:45.87]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[183:48.59]Hold on, nobody move.
[183:49.55]Don't move.
[183:50.39]Don't fucking move.
[183:51.29]Nobody move.
[184:00.36]Ah!
[184:04.43]I can't do it.
[184:05.65]I can't do it.
[184:10.79]I did it.
[184:12.29]I did it.
[184:12.69]I did it.
[184:13.15]I did it.
[184:13.61]I did it.
[184:13.97]I just did it.
[184:14.43]I just said I couldn't do it and I did it.
[184:15.99]I figured it out.
[184:17.89]I did it.
[184:18.22]I can do it.
[184:21.10]I did it.
[184:21.84]I can do it, mom.
[184:22.64]Did it.
[184:24.00]I didn't even mean to do that.
[184:24.80]That was an accident.
[184:26.02]I would have been here for like an hour if I didn't do that.
[184:30.84]Bye.
[184:31.34]I win.
[184:32.50]Sucka.
[184:36.38]Wait, what?
[184:37.84]You did it, dude.
[184:38.62]Wow, that was quick.
[184:39.46]True blue, thank you.
[184:40.64]Five months.
[184:41.26]Welcome back.
[184:42.66]Thanks.
[184:43.43]Alright, what's down here?
[184:46.01]Anything in particular?
[184:49.17]Now you're thinking of portals.
[184:52.53]This is the room I was in before.
[184:54.53]Oh, there's a guy there.
[184:55.43]There's a fucking guy that's underwater watching right now.
[184:58.46]Should I be down here?
[185:02.42]Can they see me?
[185:03.02]Okay.
[185:07.62]I didn't think that was going to happen.
[185:08.74]I didn't think that I was going to fall.
[185:09.92]I thought it was... Alright.
[185:16.53]I'm so confused about this whole situation here.
[185:18.59]They're not going to see me if I start there.
[185:27.60]Okay.
[185:31.19]Is there a scorpion?
[185:31.73]Look at that scorpion in the back.
[185:34.03]Top right, scorpion.
[185:35.13]No, actually, that... Okay, that's the number two.
[185:37.59]And, like, a car.
[185:38.63]Well, it looked like a scorpion.
[185:39.55]You all saw it.
[185:45.74]Well... I have to obviously get the water down here.
[185:57.13]Here comes a scorpion again.
[185:57.87]Here comes a scorpion.
[185:58.43]Scorpion.
[185:58.81]Scorpion.
[186:00.09]Look.
[186:00.87]See that scorpion?
[186:08.28]I think I'm screwed.
[186:09.98]I can't.
[186:10.62]He's going to have to grab me.
[186:14.34]Yeah, I did it wrong.
[186:15.31]I can't.
[186:15.65]I got to go around it.
[186:16.71]They're not even here.
[186:17.69]Where?
[186:17.95]What the fuck?
[186:18.53]Okay.
[186:18.97]No.
[186:19.35]Cool.
[186:23.15]That should do it, right?
[186:25.56]Hopefully.
[186:26.48]Ooh.
[186:29.21]Sorry, guys.
[186:30.09]They're alive.
[186:31.33]They are alive.
[186:33.07]Are they still attached?
[186:35.09]Are they coming to grab me?
[186:35.87]I don't know.
[186:36.65]These guys are fucking... Look at this guy.
[186:38.32]Look at the guy right behind me.
[186:41.00]Oh, look at their heads.
[186:45.66]Okay, yeah.
[186:46.28]It's like they can throw me and I can hit the button.
[186:50.62]Scorpion.
[186:52.12]If you missed it, it's probably not gonna happen again.
[186:54.10]You're gonna miss the scorpion if you missed it already.
[186:58.88]And then you're not gonna get to see it again.
[186:59.92]Sorry.
[187:00.16]Wait, do we have to do like a trampoline with these people?
[187:09.94]Come on!
[187:15.66]Are you guys serious?
[187:16.54]How many of you fucking dumbasses does it take?
[187:20.66]The VX, oh Christ, run.
[187:23.00]I just knocked one of them over.
[187:28.70]Okay, one, two.
[187:34.53]One, two, three.
[187:37.89]Do I need more?
[187:41.53]I think I might need more of them.
[187:45.08]Or do I have to just get them all on me?
[187:51.36]Get over here, you fucking idiots.
[187:56.41]Get out of the fucking way, all of you dumbasses.
[187:58.69]I think I have to, like... Alright, get on me, get on me, get on me.
[188:06.94]Everybody get a hold of me.
[188:09.94]I see one person over there that's not contributing.
[188:15.10]There's two people on the right that aren't contributing.
[188:22.68]I need a box.
[188:23.68]Let's go get a fucking box.
[188:31.61]God damn it.
[188:32.15]Hey, at least you're gonna get to see the scorpion.
[188:37.69]There it is.
[188:37.97]You're gonna get to see it probably one more time.
[188:42.32]They're trying their best.
[188:43.28]Well, their best is not good enough.
[188:51.39]Oh, okay.
[188:53.19]Alright, I get it.
[188:58.81]Now what?
[189:01.25]Are they actually going to follow me?
[189:03.66]Or am I going to swim up with them?
[189:05.04]Should I get thrown up into the water?
[189:08.98]Or is that enough to... Yeah, it was.
[189:13.46]Did I even say hi to the VX?
[189:16.37]Hey, the VX, thanks for five months.
[189:17.67]I just forgot if I did.
[189:19.27]I may have already said hello.
[189:20.63]Wait, what?
[189:22.31]Moda 1209, level two humanoid, and the VX.
[189:25.97]Thank you guys all for five months.
[189:28.73]Really appreciate it.
[189:29.73]Throw me up into the water here, and I can fall and touch it?
[189:32.11]I think that's what I gotta do.
[189:36.73]But thanks to the three of you guys, Moda 1209 is the last one.
[189:42.64]I already did it.
[189:43.18]Everyone's freaking out.
[189:43.90]I've already done it.
[189:45.68]I've already done it.
[189:48.84]Then I'm going to drop and press the button right when I fall.
[189:52.26]Here it comes.
[189:56.65]Bang.
[189:57.69]Let's go.
[190:00.51]Keep moving.
[190:01.93]These guys are going to come.
[190:02.77]All these guys.
[190:03.13]This is Janitor.
[190:05.75]Wait.
[190:06.09]Hold on.
[190:07.71]Those floors can wait.
[190:09.81]I'll come with you.
[190:12.21]Hopefully I don't get fired for this.
[190:17.90]Wait.
[190:18.10]Is that a hole?
[190:20.38]That is.
[190:20.82]That is a hole.
[190:22.62]Alright, throw me over there, boys.
[190:25.54]Thank you!
[190:35.37]The noises, too.
[190:37.41]The noises are so terrible.
[190:39.13]You can tell that they just all plastered into concrete.
[190:45.37]Thank you, Zombieman.
[190:46.47]Welcome back for four months, Zombieman4.
[190:49.14]Much appreciated.
[190:51.68]It looks like we're going to watch something here.
[190:53.12]There's one guy.
[190:54.24]One naked guy.
[190:56.42]It looks like there's two naked guys.
[190:59.12]Don't know where they're going, but they're going over there.
[191:06.83]Is this important?
[191:09.15]Where are these guys all going?
[191:20.20]Okay.
[191:23.67]Will I have to go down in that hole?
[191:26.01]Maybe I'll visit my friends again.
[191:29.95]Are you serious?
[191:33.25]Okay, guys.
[191:34.46]Cool.
[191:35.36]You were all just waiting for me.
[191:36.72]Throw me into the vent like good boys and girls.
[191:45.98]Oh shit!
[191:48.16]Where are my friends?
[191:51.44]Friends!
[191:53.22]There they are.
[191:53.60]I don't know where we're going, but... Uh... Okay, that brings me up here.
[192:07.79]Go back down?
[192:14.59]I missed something.
[192:21.92]Only one way to go.
[192:24.08]I didn't go this way.
[192:24.74]Can I open this?
[192:30.28]No.
[192:32.56]Shit.
[192:33.34]What did I fucking do?
[192:34.50]Obviously I'll have to come down here.
[192:48.88]I can't open the door by myself.
[192:52.86]Oh, they're all up top.
[192:53.68]They're running up top.
[192:54.42]Okay.
[193:00.02]Whoa!
[193:01.94]Okay, that is dominoing.
[193:03.78]Very good.
[193:05.02]Now we all go down and open the door.
[193:14.03]That's like the fifth or sixth Jupiter that I've seen a talent try to do.
[193:18.49]He only got it once.
[193:24.92]This is really creepy, though.
[193:25.96]Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
[193:26.92]I just, like, hit the mic.
[193:28.08]Hopefully that didn't be loud.
[193:31.22]It didn't be loud.
[193:31.98]Nice vocabulary you got there, son.
[193:35.42]Everybody crowd around.
[193:36.12]Let's get it open.
[193:42.22]Oh, boy.
[193:45.75]That's gonna be funny every time.
[193:47.01]Is this a boss fight?
[193:50.25]I got my distraction dummies here.
[194:01.35]Yeah, I am... I'm figuring I'm controlling them without the helmet.
[194:05.39]Because that lady stuck a cord in my stomach.
[194:08.81]So... Whatever, like... I probably have like a... I'm probably pregnant or something.
[194:13.03]With like a baby alien mind control baby.
[194:16.03]She's jammed it into my stomach.
[194:17.91]That's why they can all listen to me.
[194:22.70]I'm looking forward to find out.
[194:27.18]Alright, I mean this is...
[194:30.09]Can't be much longer.
[194:30.75]This is the end of the day.
[194:31.49]Here we are.
[194:31.83]End of the game music.
[194:32.69]Listen.
[194:42.56]Goodbye, Piaz.
[194:48.49]Oh, shit.
[194:49.27]It is a portal.
[194:51.03]That seriously is the portal chamber.
[194:52.87]Why is there blood in there?
[194:54.37]I thought they were, like, dummies.
[194:57.30]Coming to stream.
[194:58.06]Here, Jerma says he's there.
[194:59.00]He's pregnant with an alien baby.
[195:00.56]Nice.
[195:02.07]Well, Dether Dan, thanks for four months.
[195:05.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, people.
[195:07.23]What an idiot.
[195:12.45]Why are they running from me?
[195:15.14]Are these the same kind of people that we're trying to do?
[195:17.04]What are they looking at?
[195:17.88]What is going on here?
[195:20.00]How come no one's trying to kill me like they usually are?
[195:21.82]Let me get a better view.
[195:28.33]What the hell?
[195:28.83]Why are you... What are we looking at?
[195:33.17]How come none of you have tried to strangle me yet, like you've been doing the whole game?
[195:42.40]This is very lame.
[195:43.94]Whatever we're looking at, there's nothing in here.
[195:51.77]Okay, bye.
[196:01.28]That was really funny.
[196:07.10]That's funny.
[196:07.68]That's funny.
[196:10.78]Oh, Jesus.
[196:12.22]It's like an old shopping cart.
[196:25.93]Okay.
[196:30.20]That is funny.
[196:35.46]That was like comedy.
[196:36.32]That was like pure comedy right there.
[196:37.77]Everybody knows it.
[196:47.13]That was just proper comedy is what that was.
[196:49.59]There we go.
[196:53.33]That's where he throws the ring in.
[196:56.61]Hey guys, look at me!
[196:58.55]Oh, they don't care.
[197:05.31]The path is bumpy.
[197:07.08]No, that's the joke.
[197:08.50]It's a bumpy path.
[197:09.34]Isn't that funny?
[197:17.08]That was risky, but I did it.
[197:22.35]So was that.
[197:22.81]Let's go.
[197:33.55]Uh... Okay.
[197:37.84]Okay.
[197:39.10]Check it.
[197:41.56]I was trying to get in.
[197:51.16]I was trying to get in the thing.
[197:55.23]Okay, that's not how you get in.
[197:56.21]Uh...
[198:04.94]Okay.
[198:06.92]What does this do?
[198:07.76]Does it go up?
[198:11.39]Let's see what's up there.
[198:12.19]Oh yeah, that's really interesting stuff.
[198:14.69]Okay.
[198:19.19]Don't slip!
[198:22.82]To the right?
[198:23.38]That's the only way to go.
[198:28.24]There's a platform over there.
[198:31.78]Okay, didn't know that could turn around.
[198:33.68]None of you guys thought that either.
[198:35.10]Come on, give it a break.
[198:35.77]Did you guys expect it to turn around like that?
[198:41.85]Let's just go this way.
[198:44.43]And down.
[198:45.05]That was risky, but I did it.
[198:50.96]I remember this pole.
[198:53.72]This is the thing I hit my face off of.
[199:01.34]Alright.
[199:02.96]He's going in the water.
[199:07.52]Grab onto him.
[199:15.87]Pull him off.
[199:18.13]And... And there's one down here.
[199:20.05]Oh, this is just... I can't get it.
[199:21.71]This is like the star in Mario 64.
[199:23.39]We have to swim down into the thing.
[199:26.57]Come on.
[199:28.85]Whatever.
[199:29.71]I can't go up.
[199:33.52]What's the point of that coming up?
[199:38.44]Okay.
[199:41.68]Push it.
[199:42.30]Alright, there we go.
[199:49.13]Let's go get the star.
[199:53.43]Pull the plug.
[199:56.15]Pull the plug!
[200:00.31]Let's see the bathtub drain.
[200:04.05]Oh, fuck.
[200:08.94]Okay.
[200:10.38]Well, obviously.
[200:11.22]For the love of God.
[200:18.98]So, I need to hold?
[200:19.84]This has to be held by something?
[200:25.30]Can I tie it to something?
[200:26.57]I don't get it.
[200:29.13]What's this?
[200:32.65]Nothing I can do over here to make it hold up.
[200:38.95]The anus of destiny.
[200:43.74]Where's the rope to tie it?
[200:44.80]Okay.
[200:53.52]Did I just not hold it long enough?
[200:55.13]Shut it.
[200:55.47]Shut it off.
[200:57.19]Shut it down.
[201:04.89]Oh, okay.
[201:09.19]We're gonna go in the eye of the storm.
[201:10.61]Here we go!
[201:11.11]Okay, where have my clothes gone?
[201:24.98]I'm just like the exhibit now?
[201:26.40]That's fascinating.
[201:32.40]Do you not want me to do this?
[201:38.43]Come on.
[201:41.01]Come on.
[201:41.91]Pull the plug.
[201:44.27]Pull the plug.
[201:45.83]Okay, he doesn't want to pull the plug.
[201:54.66]What do I do?
[201:55.28]Oh, I gotta put, like, the hat on.
[202:06.05]What is this?
[202:07.98]This is like a giant brain.
[202:08.94]Oh, there's a bunch of naked people in here.
[202:13.04]Okay, what is this?
[202:20.54]What the fuck is this?
[202:22.16]What the fuck?
[202:30.16]I'm this now.
[202:31.59]This is me.
[202:40.00]You thought you could get rid of us?
[202:42.04]You fuckers.
[202:43.80]This is what you get for doing experiments to fucking humans.
[202:51.93]Can I walk as this thing?
[202:54.23]What?
[203:02.54]Let's go.
[203:03.06]Let's run to the full collapse.
[203:08.36]This is the best part of the game!
[203:10.66]This is awesome!
[203:11.74]Ah, you think you can stop me?
[203:17.62]Ah shit, he can stop me!
[203:19.46]Get him, rip it off, just like fucking Andre the Giant!
[203:24.00]Come here, you little shit!
[203:28.23]Engulf him!
[203:29.01]Engulf that guy, find him!
[203:30.23]Get him!
[203:31.99]This is so stupid!
[203:38.77]I love it.
[203:39.67]Alright, you guys, get in me.
[203:41.49]Get inside me.
[203:43.88]Everybody get in.
[203:45.82]I can't... This is not like Katamari.
[203:47.26]I can't pick people up.
[203:48.26]There we go.
[203:48.74]Pick them up.
[203:50.14]Pick them up.
[203:50.54]Okay, no, it's good.
[203:55.56]They're all holding me up.
[203:58.40]Look, I've got a giant trophy.
[203:59.86]Alright, let's go.
[204:05.34]This is so odd.
[204:09.16]This is like the weirdest shit ever.
[204:12.22]Why am I this thing?
[204:14.02]Come on, get me up there.
[204:17.58]Hoist me up.
[204:18.80]This big slug thing with arms and legs.
[204:24.53]Where am I going?
[204:26.43]What am I doing?
[204:30.37]This is fucking crazy!
[204:38.62]What the fuck?
[204:42.72]Get over here.
[204:43.74]I think I got that guy.
[204:44.62]I think I got him.
[204:52.60]This is awesome.
[204:54.78]This is like the greatest ending.
[204:56.20]If this is the ending... Do I have to backtrack the whole way?
[205:05.25]I'm breaking shit now.
[205:06.25]I didn't even do that for any reason.
[205:08.49]I'm just destroying shit.
[205:12.33]No, no, no, no, no, pull back, pull back, back, back, back, back, back.
[205:18.44]Where am I bringing this?
[205:20.26]I don't know where I'm bringing this.
[205:27.43]Okay, up here.
[205:30.57]Get on it.
[205:31.89]Climb on top of it.
[205:33.66]And... get... jump!
[205:36.76]Jump!
[205:41.96]Go!
[205:43.42]Get... okay.
[205:46.42]Wait!
[205:47.16]What?!
[205:48.08]Really, that... like, what the fuck is going on?
[205:51.92]Phantom Trout, thank you for three months.
[205:58.83]Now I'm in the cafeteria.
[206:00.60]What are they serving?
[206:01.78]Oh, pizza!
[206:02.74]I love pizza!
[206:03.58]Where you guys going?
[206:04.24]It's my favorite dish!
[206:08.76]This is insane.
[206:09.72]Am I gonna stuff in there like a mouse?
[206:16.36]Oh, God.
[206:16.84]There's the boss.
[206:19.05]That's the fucking boss.
[206:19.81]That's the CEO.
[206:22.51]Okay, look, I just want to talk about my current situation as an employee here.
[206:29.75]I would like a raise of at least a hundred bucks an hour.
[206:35.38]Ain't gonna do it?
[206:36.10]Oh, you ain't gonna do it, are ya?
[206:37.36]You're fuckin' dead.
[206:45.55]Oh, fuck.
[206:46.61]Oh, fuck, man.
[206:47.53]The police are gonna come.
[206:48.83]I just wanted a raise.
[206:49.79]What do I do?
[206:50.23]I gotta get out of here.
[206:50.81]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[206:53.99]What do I do?
[207:00.74]I'm standing up much taller.
[207:04.82]This way?
[207:05.28]That way?
[207:06.19]Yeah, wash yourself off.
[207:09.19]Get rid of the evidence.
[207:14.37]There's a fucking jump here.
[207:15.81]Am I gonna go off the jump?
[207:16.63]I think I have to stand this up and press that button.
[207:24.45]Yeah, that's what I have to do.
[207:25.25]I gotta hold it up like a big pool cue.
[207:31.29]Come on, you guys can do it.
[207:34.19]God.
[207:37.08]It's like balancing dishes.
[207:39.77]Nice work, everybody.
[207:40.97]Oh shit, dogs!
[207:42.05]Oh god!
[207:43.79]Are they gonna start eating me?
[207:47.42]Jesus, this is terrible.
[207:48.92]Wait, give me my pool cue.
[207:50.22]I need that, maybe.
[207:53.54]Do I need this?
[207:56.40]I think I might need it.
[207:57.14]Yeah, I need it.
[207:57.64]See?
[207:57.82]I have to, like, press this.
[207:59.78]Alright, get on it.
[208:02.82]Get on it!
[208:03.22]Ugh!
[208:08.45]I knew I needed the pool cue.
[208:10.79]Wait.
[208:12.09]Okay.
[208:12.67]We're just going down, I guess.
[208:23.62]That was like a bunch of broken bones.
[208:25.02]Can I open the door?
[208:25.64]This guy's pointing this way.
[208:31.87]I don't have to climb up this ladder, do I?
[208:37.44]Oh, big mistake, buddy.
[208:41.62]Damn it, I want to crush him.
[208:46.18]Alright, I'm not going to do anything.
[208:47.82]You're safe.
[208:53.38]He just looked.
[208:54.41]Oh, he opened it for me.
[208:58.17]Okay, I thought he was being an asshole.
[209:05.55]I don't want to go in there.
[209:06.49]Jump over it.
[209:09.16]Secret.
[209:11.16]Nope, no secret.
[209:14.70]Am I gonna fit in this?
[209:17.14]This is like stuffing.
[209:18.39]No goddamn way.
[209:25.11]What the hell is happening?
[209:27.37]This is so weird.
[209:28.64]Yeah, offer it up to the sun god.
[209:40.44]Okay, I can't go this way.
[209:41.36]Wait, what are they lifting this?
[209:42.54]Okay, I'm so happy that this game turned into you are a giant blob murdering everything.
[209:51.61]We'll just take it with us.
[209:57.83]I'm just a hairball.
[210:02.72]Can I grab that?
[210:04.26]Pull up?
[210:05.34]No?
[210:07.24]Did I have it right the first time to just knock it sucked up?
[210:14.55]I don't know.
[210:19.11]It seems like it's... I have to throw... I'm gonna start coughing.
[210:22.85]I'm just playing catch with myself now.
[210:34.44]Can I just fucking throw it through the window?
[210:46.19]Is there another one over here?
[210:46.99]That I didn't see?
[210:48.11]Can I smash something?
[210:57.11]Oh, oh, oh!
[210:58.05]I can throw it up there.
[211:00.91]Yay!
[211:02.15]You broke a light.
[211:03.01]Good for you.
[211:04.93]Smash it.
[211:06.49]I'm going to take this with us just in case we need it.
[211:09.52]Just in case there's somebody I can throw it at.
[211:12.68]I want to just bury this into somebody's face.
[211:18.85]I hope there's a guy that's just standing here.
[211:26.53]Am I just putting fuel in here?
[211:29.51]Okay.
[211:31.46]Get it in there.
[211:35.42]It's on fire!
[211:36.42]Oh, I get it!
[211:36.78]I get it!
[211:37.04]Come on!
[211:37.26]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[211:39.18]Hold it up, hold it up, hold it up!
[211:40.82]Don't- Oh, fuck!
[211:42.36]No!
[211:44.26]There's water?
[211:46.53]Why is there water?
[211:48.37]Can I turn it off?
[211:50.33]How do I turn off the fucking water?
[211:54.38]You assholes.
[211:58.60]Hold on.
[212:01.88]What?
[212:05.62]I can throw it.
[212:06.06]I got it.
[212:06.38]I got it.
[212:06.74]I got it.
[212:07.00]I know what to do.
[212:07.56]I'm going to throw it over and I'm going to run and catch it.
[212:15.22]I'm gonna throw it.
[212:15.84]I gotta throw it and then I gotta catch it.
[212:17.68]I gotta catch it.
[212:21.20]Get it in there.
[212:23.97]Get it.
[212:24.97]Alright, go.
[212:26.49]Throw it in the air and then run and grab it.
[212:27.91]Nice work.
[212:30.81]Good job.
[212:31.33]Catch it.
[212:32.59]It's like a fucking circus act.
[212:36.74]Don't let it touch the water, please.
[212:41.83]PoppyLove, thank you for two months too, welcome.
[212:43.95]And did I miss Phantom Trout too?
[212:45.27]This is when all this crazy shit's been happening.
[212:47.33]But Phantom Trout and PoppyLove, thank you for two months and three months.
[212:50.69]Respectively.
[212:51.67]And let's blow this fucking place to hell.
[212:53.85]Got it.
[212:55.23]Let's go.
[213:01.23]Tor, just hit me right in the face.
[213:03.75]If this thing had a face.
[213:10.61]Get in the trash.
[213:12.57]I've got to hide in the dumpster.
[213:16.07]Somehow I've kept my intelligence.
[213:18.19]You'd think that this would be... This thing would be an idiot.
[213:21.67]But it's not, apparently.
[213:26.36]This is what you wanted, right?
[213:27.28]This is what you guys wanted.
[213:28.02]Alright, get on it.
[213:33.06]You want me to come all the way?
[213:39.82]Throw it.
[213:42.93]That's what he wants to do.
[213:44.53]Toss it down.
[213:44.95]Alright, let me get it.
[213:48.25]Just reach it.
[213:49.17]Just get it.
[213:53.96]Oh, man.
[213:54.70]Well, I have to go and grab this then.
[214:02.46]Now climb it again.
[214:03.54]I wanted to grab his hand.
[214:09.05]Hopefully it rips this guy down.
[214:15.07]Let's go.
[214:18.79]It's a giant wrecking ball.
[214:28.29]I'm dragging my nuts across this.
[214:34.09]Got it!
[214:34.39]That was loud.
[214:39.46]That was really loud.
[214:40.32]Alright, climb.
[214:47.00]How much longer is this?
[214:47.92]This is, like, just torture on myself.
[214:50.94]This poor guy.
[214:51.80]Well, guys.
[214:53.16]Girl.
[214:53.46]I don't even know what this is anymore.
[214:54.50]That thing's not going to be able to carry me, is it?
[214:57.00]Are you shitting me?
[215:01.00]How am I... Oh, don't.
[215:10.43]Oh, thanks, dude.
[215:13.67]Appreciate that.
[215:16.48]Oh.
[215:18.70]Okay, it's gonna... It's gonna... Okay, I get it.
[215:22.72]Do it again.
[215:23.92]Please, thank you.
[215:25.20]Pull it again, please.
[215:28.90]Pull it.
[215:30.88]You did it.
[215:31.26]Good job.
[215:33.76]I know what to do.
[215:35.12]It's gonna jump up.
[215:38.97]Thank you.
[215:41.31]What?
[215:43.15]Oh.
[215:43.87]Hey, can you do that one more time for me?
[215:45.98]Just one more time.
[215:46.58]That's all it's going to take.
[215:47.31]I promise.
[215:49.19]Okay.
[215:50.73]Do it again.
[215:57.01]And... Go!
[216:01.55]It just crushed me.
[216:02.29]No, it didn't.
[216:07.02]Thank God.
[216:07.42]What is that?
[216:08.56]No, don't touch that.
[216:09.28]It's a trap.
[216:09.90]That's a trap.
[216:11.70]There's hundreds of people in this room.
[216:15.86]You see how many people are in here?
[216:16.64]It's like a whole stadium full of people.
[216:26.61]I guess I'm gonna... They're just teasing me.
[216:30.85]Oh!
[216:36.84]Wait!
[216:37.56]No!
[216:43.44]The end.
[216:48.84]Is this at the end?
[216:52.20]I guess I can still move.
[216:54.78]Down, I guess.
[216:57.65]What is this?
[217:03.59]Pull panels off?
[217:07.77]Do I have to find the right panel or something?
[217:09.35]Is one of these panels missing?
[217:11.59]Oh, okay.
[217:12.25]I guess it was just that panel.
[217:14.05]Good thing I found it accidentally.
[217:16.64]Go in there.
[217:21.75]Fish.
[217:24.79]Follow the fish, they'll take me home.
[217:31.36]Good security, I know, really.
[217:34.26]You want to contain a giant blob, make sure you have the panels easily ripped off by a baby's hands.
[217:44.42]Okay.
[217:52.56]How much further do I have to go?
[217:59.08]This looks like the end of the road here.
[218:10.09]What am I doing?
[218:10.77]I'm trying to climb it?
[218:12.23]Shit.
[218:12.67]Can't go that way.
[218:15.23]Or can I?
[218:17.33]Now we can go even faster.
[218:19.13]Yep.
[218:19.73]Go even faster.
[218:20.31]Go, go, go, go, go.
[218:29.45]Now I really am a Katamari ball.
[218:34.86]I actually am Katamari.
[218:42.50]I did it.
[218:44.53]I escaped the mad science lair.
[218:49.71]Now do I just sit here as a rock for eternity?
[218:58.67]Congratulations.
[218:59.47]The end of inside.
[219:01.74]You become a rock.
[219:13.93]I can't move.
[219:14.61]I guess something's happening here.
[219:25.41]I really am a rock.
[219:26.55]I really turned into a rock.
[219:27.98]I turned into a rock.
[219:30.56]I turned into a fucking rock for real.
[219:32.18]Look at that.
[219:32.72]Look at this.
[219:33.12]It's a rock.
[219:34.46]It's turning into... Look at it.
[219:35.18]It's solidifying.
[219:35.84]I was fucking right.
[219:36.72]That means all these rocks... All these rocks are fucking human blob people.
[219:43.81]I was right.
[219:52.31]That's how rocks are made.
[220:03.33]No, we're waiting until after the credits.
[220:06.67]Mm-mm.
[220:08.21]We're gonna wait some... Ready?
[220:09.79]Boom.
[220:10.37]Listen to this one.
[220:11.45]Boys and girls.
[220:12.73]After the credits roll.
[220:13.98]Boing.
[220:15.06]Bing.
[220:15.54]Boing.
[220:16.36]Credits are gonna roll.
[220:17.20]I'm gonna be a rock.
[220:18.24]Some dude's gonna come out and, like, be on a picnic with his family and someone's gonna be sitting on that fucking rock.
[220:22.20]Guarantee it.
[220:22.64]Guarantee.
[220:25.96]Guarantee.
[220:29.43]Someone's gonna be sitting on that rock.
[220:30.48]It's gonna say, like, 50 years later, and there's gonna be a person sitting their ass on that rock.
[220:44.41]Here we go.
[220:53.23]Here we go.
[220:54.61]It's gonna happen.
[220:57.44]The arms and legs fall off after a couple of years.
[220:59.24]Kind of looks like a big crab.
[221:05.02]Okay, here it comes.
[221:25.41]Here we go.
[221:25.87]Here it comes.
[221:31.31]gonna be on the beach we see we didn't like pay attention in the beginning the game here we're like when we go to the beach there's a rock on that beach it's me right oh they cut it from the game here comes the bonus and I don't okay let's do it all again and let's get the secrets and see the secret
[222:02.04]Okay, so... Let's piece this together here.
[222:05.42]While we have a chance.
[222:06.22]So there's... A weird corporate conglomerate world.
[222:11.26]Where they are, like, they steal people.
[222:14.12]And scientists have been trying to put people together into a giant ball.
[222:18.28]That's like a hive mind to control all humans.
[222:25.52]And then eventually you turn into the pile of snot.
[222:29.54]And you break out and it's like, I'm done with this.
[222:31.46]I don't want to do this anymore.
[222:32.44]I don't want too much power.
[222:34.38]Then you turn into a rock on a beach.
[222:36.40]That's the bad ending.
[222:37.15]Alright, here comes the good ending.
[222:43.17]No, this is a bad ending too.
[222:45.07]That's it.
[222:49.19]Alright, well.
[222:50.45]What was it, like four hours?
[222:52.65]That was cool.
[222:55.62]It's in the cornfield.
[223:00.05]Alright, that was the whole game leading up to that point.
[223:05.42]Was... Let's talk about like... So part of game where you're not giant alien blob person.
[223:13.56]It was pretty good.
[223:15.64]It was pretty good.
[223:16.50]It was very atmospheric, very cool, interesting.
[223:18.43]And cool, you know, weird shit going on.
[223:21.67]Part where you become the blob was like game of the year.
[223:27.41]I would have them rather just make you play as the blob for like the whole game.
[223:31.73]Get to like 50 minutes into the game and then you are a blob that murders things.
[223:36.58]And you grow and shit.
[223:39.78]But no, that was... That was good.
[223:47.13]A little on the short side, but it was still... It was very interesting.
[223:53.73]I will say, for sure.
[223:56.64]Game of the year?
[223:57.52]No, not game of the year.
[223:58.42]I said the part, like, if, okay, so if you just took the part with the blob.
[224:02.72]Current game of the year.
[224:03.68]Blob forward, current game of the year.
[224:06.10]Everything before blob, the time before blob?
[224:09.56]Yeah, alright.
[224:12.78]No, that was good.
[224:13.22]That was fun.
[224:16.48]So, um, I missed the secret area.
[224:21.76]Well, let's just go to the secret area.
[224:23.37]Who cares, right?
[224:23.93]Let's find it.
[224:27.74]Who are these people, by the way?
[224:28.76]Who the fuck are these guys?
[224:35.73]Never explains to people with the happy face masks.
[224:46.66]That was crazy, though.
[224:47.82]All the animal stuff was really weird and interesting.
[224:49.66]The dogs were terrifying.
[224:50.70]It was good.
[224:51.02]It was a very atmospheric game.
[224:56.85]Here comes the dog.
[224:59.13]I would recommend.
[225:05.10]Where's the, how far is the cornfield from here?
[225:13.92]Oh, fuck.
[225:14.60]I, like, have to, I gotta do a bunch of shit.
[225:16.48]Alright, if you want to see, like, the secret, you can just, like, you know, you know what to do.
[225:20.32]You either get the game yourself and play through.
[225:21.94]No, that's the, that's the thing.
[225:24.22]We're starting to load in.
[225:27.15]Oh, God.
[225:29.85]So here.
[225:32.21]Alright.
[225:32.51]Hey, look, the secret.
[225:36.00]I found the secret area, guys.
[225:37.16]They just, they, like, gave it to me.
[225:45.46]Where is it?
[225:51.46]Okay.
[225:52.98]Secret.
[225:55.33]Secret.
[226:01.83]Oh, damn.
[226:04.31]There's all kinds of shit.
[226:05.37]Look at that.
[226:06.27]Rip it out.
[226:07.33]Yeah!
[226:07.65]Alright, where are we going from here?
[226:16.34]Button to press?
[226:23.34]It's a code?
[226:23.94]I got another code?
[226:26.70]Alright, what's the Konami code?
[226:28.30]Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
[226:43.90]Uh... So what, did I just leave, or...
[226:50.09]The code won't work without the other secrets.
[226:52.17]Up, up, up, right, left, left, left, up, up, right, left, right, right, right.
[226:58.27]No, we can't see it.
[226:59.86]Let me in there.
[227:00.52]Ah.
[227:13.63]What's in there?
[227:14.25]What's in that fucking area?
[227:16.05]Oh, well.
[227:17.97]I didn't deactivate all the devices.
[227:19.41]It's okay.
[227:23.03]Oh, well.
[227:23.73]It was fun.
[227:26.94]Maybe I'll do that on my own time or something.
[227:30.00]I think I'm done playing this game for the day.
[227:34.10]TCL?
[227:34.82]I wish I could.
[227:36.12]I wish I could, dude.
[227:37.45]That'd be fucking hilarious.
[227:40.39]Hold on.
[227:40.65]I need something real important.
[227:47.83]I want to kill the CEO again.
[227:52.77]Where was the CEO?
[227:55.45]Was it this one right here?
[227:56.29]I think it might have been this one.
[228:02.02]Is this the door of the CEO?
[228:12.05]I want to see if I can't... I'm going to try not to kill the CEO.
[228:21.90]One more back.
[228:22.48]Oh, it's not this one?
[228:24.56]Oh, fuck.
[228:25.00]It's not this one.
[228:27.22]This one right here?
[228:27.84]Oh, shit.
[228:28.16]I can see his body on the ground.
[228:29.78]Alright, let's go to the CEO's room one more time.
[228:37.70]Let's try not to kill the CEO.
[228:46.32]Oh, this is too far.
[228:47.12]I give up.
[228:49.06]Let's just look at the CEO's body.
[228:51.25]Whoa!
[228:51.83]Smashed!
[228:52.29]Grossed!
[228:52.75]You see, I just did that.
[228:53.51]That was disgusting.
[228:56.29]Alright, guys.
[228:56.83]That's gonna be it.
[228:59.97]Thank you all for coming out to the stream.
[229:02.57]Thank you to all the new subs, all the old subs, all the resubs, everybody.
[229:07.87]I'm gonna take a break here.
[229:08.77]I'm gonna grab some food.
[229:10.89]And, uh, yeah.
[229:11.71]That was a fun game.

[229:19.95]And I will catch you guys later.
[229:25.42]Go kill Easy Pete.
[229:28.65]I'm sure he was probably in that crowd somewhere.
[229:30.77]I ran him over.
[229:34.36]Good night, guys.
[229:36.54]I will probably be around.
[229:39.12]I'll be around tomorrow.
[229:39.98]I've got another game I want to stream.
[229:41.24]I'll probably stream it tomorrow.
[229:43.94]Who knows, though, and if you're new, if you just found this stream and you haven't left it and you're still here, then maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
[229:53.11]Take it easy, guys.
[229:53.79]Good night.
[229:54.81]Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
