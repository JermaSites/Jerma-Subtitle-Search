[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.00]People are gonna be real confused when they hear, like, the Dark Souls.
[00:07.90]We're playing Dark Souls tonight, guys.
[00:10.96]Well, I need to unmute.
[00:19.09]Might as well just mute this, too.
[00:21.31]How's everybody doing?
[00:21.91]Uh, currently in VRChat.
[00:29.40]Got a special guest tonight, too.
[00:35.19]Change everything over here.
[00:36.05]We don't need an intro.
[00:38.23]Oh, I'm muted in the game.
[00:39.63]Shit, hold on.
[00:47.74]Hey, am I muted still?
[00:50.34]You're good and you're late.
[00:52.04]Wait, wait.
[00:52.76]Hey!
[00:52.98]Oh!
[00:53.16]Hold on, sorry.
[01:06.24]Yeah, sorry.
[01:06.78]I was just putting my points in.
[01:10.25]Hi, guys!
[01:11.01]Are you all good?
[01:12.21]Are you okay?
[01:13.09]I think I'm alright.
[01:15.23]I did put two points into Dex, though.
[01:19.73]Dex builds.
[01:20.41]I almost just fell over already.
[01:25.85]Wait, I am a Dex build.
[01:26.59]Alright, yeah.
[01:27.15]We're good.
[01:27.65]We're good.
[01:29.31]We're good.
[01:29.71]Why am I using this?
[01:34.25]So, can we go VRJosh?
[01:36.51]Kiwo?
[01:38.77]Kiwo also streaming right now, right?
[01:43.31]How do I... I got my thumbs up, but they're not my thumbs.
[01:50.58]Great avatar.
[01:51.54]I think I like mine.
[01:53.88]And this guy?
[01:55.26]Is he an asset?
[01:56.10]Can I pick him up?
[01:59.66]He just sits here.
[02:01.17]Why is his head so small?
[02:03.33]Is his head that big in the game?
[02:04.33]So, I think it's going to get a little bit weird.
[02:09.65]I want to warn you now.
[02:12.71]Yeah, it's about to get really weird.
[02:15.84]What's the panic button?
[02:16.98]Is there a panic button?
[02:17.86]This is VRChat.
[02:18.72]Yes, there is a panic button.
[02:20.10]So you're going to have to disable it, but I want to tell you how to disable it first.
[02:24.24]So if you go to the safety menu, open your menu, top right, safety,
[02:29.25]You got like all these options.
[02:30.81]Hold on.
[02:31.13]You're going to have to do that one more time.
[02:33.11]I was looking at your face.
[02:33.93]Say that one more time.
[02:34.57]Alright.
[02:35.21]You're looking at my face.
[02:37.08]oh god they're here um so um so hit uh safety it's the top right option don't worry about don't worry about these people right now ignore ignore okay uh so yeah safety is the top right you've got all these options um you'll just want to remember to go back to normal uh the normal tab on the safety menu when you're uh done with this you see the normal tab there normal
[02:59.59]so if you open the safety yeah so if you open safety I'm on normal right now there's maximum normal yeah yeah normal is fine right now okay if you would like to to just make everyone go away you press you press and hold I think let me double check I think it's both menu button yes okay
[03:18.37]So I don't know if you can still hear me, I think I muted you, but you hit both of the menu buttons above your trackpad and both grips on your controllers at the same time.
[03:27.45]Press and hold them on both, and then you should get a warning saying you're in safe mode.
[03:31.66]Okay.
[03:32.80]I think I have you muted now.
[03:33.94]Yeah, let me go back to normal.
[03:38.74]Hold everything.
[03:40.66]So if you hit the two buttons above your touchpad and your grip buttons at the same time, you should go into safe mode.
[03:47.36]Okay, cool.
[03:48.86]and then yeah so yeah both there we go okay okay how do I get out of safe mode oh no this is just like that episode of black mirror how do I get out of safe mode I've been blocked by everybody
[04:16.36]Oh, I can hear him.
[04:17.28]Can you hear me?
[04:17.84]So back to normal, right?
[04:20.35]Okay.
[04:20.57]Does that work?
[04:30.62]It should.
[04:31.18]It should load everything back to normal.
[04:32.76]Alright, perfect.
[04:33.60]Yeah, I think we're good.
[04:34.92]Yeah, give it a second.
[04:35.58]It might lag out as it loads everyone back in, but... Yeah, anyway, so if someone shows up with a really bad avatar, which shouldn't happen with our crowd, but if it does happen, just remember, safe mode, yeah.
[04:48.43]Alright, well, welcome to VRChat.
[04:52.33]This is the future.
[04:54.55]Guys, I've never been here before.
[04:55.55]First time in VRChat.
[04:59.66]Welcome, man.
[05:00.56]Welcome.
[05:01.04]Welcome.
[05:01.60]Shaggy!
[05:02.35]Welcome.
[05:02.95]Yeah, want some Scooby snacks, man?
[05:05.41]Some virtual ones?
[05:06.25]Yeah, at least poisoned.
[05:07.21]There you go.
[05:08.79]Is your arm getting tired?
[05:10.63]Josh, can you... No, don't worry about it.
[05:13.20]Can you die in the game?
[05:16.18]Yeah, you die for real, though.
[05:18.20]Jump down the well.
[05:18.90]Some games.
[05:24.09]Yeah, you can die if you go down here.
[05:25.99]Oh, that's the guy from Mass Effect.
[05:28.19]I need to rest up.
[05:29.31]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[05:32.37]Can you die?
[05:37.51]No, you can't die.
[05:41.89]Oh, yeah.
[05:44.61]By the way, my avatar is just a Play-Doh guy.
[05:46.91]Oh, no.
[05:48.44]This character sucks.
[05:49.30]Oh, are you okay down there?
[05:52.16]I'm alright.
[05:52.74]I'm okay.
[05:54.23]Can somebody throw a rope?
[05:55.79]Yeah, so if you want to get back, you can respawn.
[05:58.97]Open your menu.
[06:01.53]I love how you're like the paperclip Microsoft guy.
[06:05.99]You know what I mean?
[06:06.59]But the scouts...
[06:09.38]That's so funny.
[06:10.16]If you want to get back, you just gotta, alright.
[06:12.77]I need to get Clippy.
[06:14.19]You need to get a Clippy avatar.
[06:15.79]So as Clippy, you open your menu and right in the middle area is Respawn.
[06:19.59]You just click that and you'll go back to the start of the map.
[06:21.62]Alright, cool.
[06:22.34]Maybe something else out of the food.
[06:25.68]You're gonna give me some food?
[06:29.60]I see you falling down a hill.
[06:30.62]Please, feed me.
[06:32.37]Please.
[06:32.67]Okay.
[06:41.77]I'm just gonna swim through all those people.
[06:43.41]Are you alright?
[06:45.36]Um... I'm so sorry.
[06:47.54]I... I... I should've warned you.
[06:51.48]I look like a kid.
[06:52.72]This is fu- This is cool.
[06:55.76]Okay.
[06:56.38]Okay.
[06:57.16]Well... This is... This is everyone.
[06:59.96]These are my weird VR friends.
[07:02.18]Okay.
[07:02.90]I met most of them in here.
[07:04.52]These are my weird VR friends.
[07:07.29]Yeah.
[07:07.69]Yeah.
[07:12.44]Do you want to go explore?
[07:13.92]Yeah, let's get into it.
[07:14.60]Do you want to actually see?
[07:15.78]We'll have a look and see what this world has to offer.
[07:18.63]Let's play Dark Souls.
[07:20.17]I'm not good at Dark Souls.
[07:22.33]Monkeys suck.
[07:23.49]I don't know how to do that.
[07:26.05]That's terrifying.
[07:28.75]So this is where Framp, that's Framp.
[07:31.37]Does he talk?
[07:31.91]You can go see him if you want.
[07:32.99]Yeah, you can talk to him even.
[07:33.99]If you kind of look down and click, you should be able to click on him.
[07:36.42]Really?
[07:37.12]Down the hole.
[07:37.86]Yeah, partly down the hole.
[07:39.24]I'm making noise.
[07:41.00]Should see an orb to click on.
[07:44.12]That's really cool.
[07:47.19]Where it is, man.
[07:49.01]Will he pick you up and bring you down?
[07:50.29]No, they don't have that, sadly.
[07:53.33]Aww, this is bizarre, but awesome.
[07:56.47]They have the crow up there, above you.
[07:59.29]The raven or whatever.
[08:01.16]He fed his upgraded weapon.
[08:05.08]Ah, goddammit.
[08:10.40]Oh my god.
[08:11.24]I haven't seen that in VR yet.
[08:14.40]Oh, I got it.
[08:15.88]I mean, no, Ace.
[08:16.76]This is like one of the earlier maps.
[08:18.60]Ace, this is the cheddar cheese house talk.
[08:21.62]Oh, there you go.
[08:22.40]We lost the melted plastic Mikey.
[08:27.71]Mikey?
[08:28.11]Mikey?
[08:29.39]My avatar.
[08:30.59]I'm like a... We haven't even been in here.
[08:33.87]This avatar is so bad.
[08:35.49]So, he wasn't able to clone earlier.
[08:37.69]We need to see maybe Ace to get back.
[08:39.43]This is what happens.
[08:41.41]Play mannequin.
[08:42.87]Well, at least you got working legs, you know?
[08:46.03]We got that going for you.
[08:48.37]I'm really interested, like, the robot that is observing things.
[08:52.55]So this is the otter.
[08:54.15]Interesting.
[08:57.92]We're trying to get the scout one if you'd like.
[09:02.72]I don't know if you'd prefer the scout or something else.
[09:04.84]I'll take it if I can get it.
[09:06.48]Oh, shit!
[09:09.27]This is not what I picked!
[09:11.45]I'm so sorry, this doesn't happen, I swear.
[09:15.92]This is the man that's in charge of the avatars.
[09:22.20]So now, try opening your menu, click on the little cylinder around him, and then on the upper right, you can clone.
[09:31.75]Wait I'm still talking over there?
[09:46.79]Yeah, Josh was right.
[09:47.55]No, no, not you, not you.
[09:49.11]Hi, Josh.
[09:49.79]There's a bug in the game that, yeah.
[09:53.13]Oh, there we go.
[09:54.39]I think there might be a mirror if you want to check yourself out.
[09:59.23]Where's the mirror?
[10:00.77]Switch avatars, that'll fix it.
[10:04.93]She was talking to me, but I don't know where she is.
[10:06.87]She's right out towards the fire, towards the fire.
[10:12.06]Where's the fire?
[10:12.68]I played this game, like, not even a year ago, and I don't even know where the fire is.
[10:15.81]No, not the fire.
[10:18.19]You need the mirror.
[10:21.59]Oh.
[10:22.11]I don't know where it is!
[10:25.47]Wait, is there a mirror on this map?
[10:26.68]I forgot.
[10:27.00]Okay.
[10:27.52]So, wait, I can turn this on?
[10:30.48]I don't know if there is a mirror on this map actually what is that thing yeah we can find another map if you just want to like I know that's what you call sanic saying what is that thing in VRChat is kind of redundant right because like what are all of these we all look at each other like what is that talking about me oh no I'm talking about you I think I just thought about that that's awesome the other tracer
[10:56.06]This isn't Blade and Sword, nevermind.
[10:57.70]I can't do Force Push.
[10:59.16]No.
[10:59.62]Yeah, he was that tracer.
[11:01.42]The denim tracer, I think, yeah.
[11:02.98]Can we all be the scout and try to run through Dark Souls?
[11:07.86]We can try!
[11:09.05]It doesn't have the whole map.
[11:10.09]I wish it did, but I think it's not.
[11:12.15]Can we speedrun VR Dark Souls?
[11:16.43]I don't think it's been done before!
[11:17.87]There might be- I wonder if Chimp has some legs to spare!
[11:21.35]Good god!
[11:22.44]You know that spot where, like, you roll in and- Oh, this is crazy.
[11:33.52]You can see it, you can see.
[11:36.64]Um, we found the mirror, if you wanna have a... Wait, I just like came, I just have an out-of-body experience.
[11:42.76]Hey.
[11:42.94]Hey.
[11:43.16]Hey.
[11:43.38]Hey.
[11:43.66]Oh, I think he just learned that he can... Yeah.
[11:46.73]When you, um, bring up the menu...
[12:02.91]Oh, okay.
[12:03.37]I didn't mean to do that.
[12:04.89]Alright, so... Alright, do you want to go find the mirror?
[12:09.38]Yeah, let's go find the mirror.
[12:12.00]This is it.
[12:13.14]Can we arm wrestle?
[12:13.84]Can we do an arm wrestling tournament?
[12:15.12]If you follow the weird... Follow the white rabbit, and he'll take you to the mirror.
[12:20.28]Follow the white rabbit.
[12:22.46]Okay, here we go.
[12:24.28]I've heard of circles, right?
[12:25.56]Stupid.
[12:29.42]Are you showing them the mirror?
[12:31.24]I told you not to do that.
[12:32.33]Who's the big square guy?
[12:37.21]It's the other white rabbit.
[12:39.27]You gotta follow the right white rabbit.
[12:40.59]Are we following the big square person?
[12:43.47]Yeah, just follow Kingpin.
[12:45.45]Oh, Kingpin.
[12:46.53]Okay, I get it.
[12:48.60]I get it.
[12:49.62]Yeah.
[12:50.14]Find him later.
[12:52.78]Don't worry about it.
[12:55.98]Alice in Wonderland.
[12:58.36]What?
[13:00.96]Didn't know if you're gonna make it that Almost didn't make it Because play mace Down there are you gonna catch me?
[13:24.64]Maybe.
[13:24.80]Here we have you, don't worry about it.
[13:26.88]We got this!
[13:29.04]Alright, you're just a giant beanbag chair.
[13:34.02]And then you click on that and you get a mirror over here on your right.
[13:37.26]And the mirror's right here.
[13:39.96]Yeah, you should have a mirror right here if you click on it.
[13:41.96]Wait, are we... Which one of us is the real one?
[13:45.31]No?
[13:46.13]Okay.
[13:47.15]Yeah, now you can see the... Probably would like the mouth movements on that.
[13:53.25]I'm pretty sure they're pretty good.
[13:57.27]What a weird fucking world we live in right now, you understand?
[14:00.10]Think of how fucked up this actually is.
[14:03.88]Think about everything they wrote books about.
[14:07.92]Like 40 years ago they wrote books about this shit and it was supposed to scare us.
[14:12.36]Are you scared?
[14:14.20]You should be!
[14:22.80]Oh, it's gonna be me.
[14:25.85]How'd you do that?
[14:27.73]I haven't seen him backflip before.
[14:31.28]Wait, you have not seen my backflip?
[14:33.26]No, I haven't seen the song.
[14:35.98]I haven't seen the little kingpin backflip, no.
[14:38.54]Then again... Holy shit!
[14:56.45]AREN'T YOU SCARED YET?!
[14:57.45]This is awesome.
[14:58.77]I feel like I need to be more animated.
[15:02.77]I'm just like... I can't...
[15:27.63]We're gonna wait.
[15:28.51]Is there a secret passage?
[15:31.03]Have we been in here for like an hour?
[15:32.88]I don't know what that was.
[15:41.02]I don't know.
[15:42.38]There was a giant... What's over here?
[15:47.23]I'm so sorry.
[15:50.61]I can't explain this.
[15:53.49]I don't think it needs explaining.
[15:54.75]I think it's very self-explanatory.
[15:58.03]Is it safe to go over and look?
[15:59.48]Is it really?
[16:00.22]Do you see that?
[16:01.88]Just peek around the rock.
[16:03.00]You can see that, right?
[16:04.12]My game's lagging.
[16:05.14]Oh, Death Run.
[16:05.90]I'd like to die.
[16:06.86]There's some good Death Run maps, like Death Run.
[16:09.70]Long live the king.
[16:11.06]My computer sucks.
[16:23.29]Just a couple feet off the ground.
[16:25.69]Come on, man!
[16:26.61]If you toggle the mirror, then it should fix.
[16:31.50]Oh, oh, okay, because it's mirroring everything.
[16:36.08]Oh, he's getting framed.
[16:37.06]Toggle the mirror.
[16:37.86]The box is gone!
[16:42.43]Okay, every character here is from some form of media, okay?
[16:46.47]You're from Overwatch.
[17:12.64]You're from, um... What?
[17:15.12]Looking out into the what?
[17:16.42]Anime.
[17:17.24]Animated television.
[17:18.92]You're from Sonic.
[17:20.10]You're from animated TV.
[17:21.24]You're from... I don't know.
[17:23.31]Circus.
[17:24.19]You're... Killing four.
[17:26.27]What is this from?
[17:27.91]Movie.
[17:29.57]His mind.
[17:30.25]His mind.
[17:32.23]I just... I don't know.
[17:34.02]He's got hundreds of them.
[17:37.22]That was amazing.
[17:38.64]That was incredible.
[17:40.40]Thank you.
[17:42.08]I just drank some tomato juice one night and I decided to sculpt something.
[17:46.58]This is fucking incredible.
[17:50.20]I'm sorry.
[17:51.42]That's so good though.
[17:53.12]It's so good.
[17:54.30]It's so good.
[17:54.96]Josh learned how to make spore models.
[17:59.51]It's a spore model so you can...
[18:07.66]You can make creatures in Spore and then export the model.
[18:11.57]You can actually do that?
[18:14.49]Anything you can make in Spore, basically, you can turn into a VRChat avatar.
[18:18.53]The implications are terrible.
[18:19.77]You look like what's left after eating a whole chicken.
[18:24.17]Just the bones.
[18:26.77]Why are you saying this to me?
[18:28.37]This is amazing.
[18:29.31]Anyways, I was thinking, um, I was thinking Death Run would be a fun, like, game if you wanted to actually, like, have a game to play.
[18:35.47]Yeah, let's do it.
[18:36.91]Death Run is good.
[18:38.42]It's good.
[18:38.92]Do you want to set up the portal, Kiwo?
[18:41.82]How did we want to do these maps?
[18:43.16]Did you want to do, like, invite only, or...
[18:46.14]Friends only.
[18:46.76]We don't want to do like a friends plus probably, right?
[18:49.26]Somewhere a little less claustrophobic.
[18:50.70]There's a lot of people in this place coming by.
[18:53.10]No, not friends plus.
[18:54.02]Oh, I can't hear.
[18:55.42]I'm asking her if she wants to be the one that sets all the portals.
[18:58.55]Is he just peeing?
[18:59.37]Do you want me to do that?
[19:01.97]Help me, Miles.
[19:04.81]You okay?
[19:07.67]I tripped and fell.
[19:09.58]I tripped on some old bones.
[19:12.06]I like how your belly is moving when you talk.
[19:17.70]I'm burying myself.
[19:20.40]Bye.
[19:22.50]You know what you should show him, Ace?
[19:25.26]You should show him the mole rat.
[19:27.42]That's not Ace.
[19:28.36]That's Ace.
[19:29.54]Yeah, I know.
[19:30.10]I was pointing at the ground.
[19:31.30]Bye.
[19:39.27]You can do a lot of stuff that's just strange.
[20:02.17]I'm not one to be talking.
[20:03.31]Well, yeah, you would know.
[20:04.51]Like, have you seen, like, all of your avatars?
[20:07.32]This is amazing.
[20:08.70]You said I was really big?
[20:09.72]Yeah.
[20:12.46]Well, I know what I'm doing for the rest of my life.
[20:15.50]No, don't do it!
[20:18.66]There have been people who have spent, like, seven days in VR before, I think, right?
[20:22.40]There's, like, a stream for that.
[20:24.38]Kyo is just up here, like, observing.
[20:29.94]The best part was when Snake just, like, zoomed up these stairs.
[20:41.03]Alright.
[20:45.23]Well, this is Dark Souls.
[20:46.49]You are in the right place.
[20:47.45]Is that gonna be really loud?
[20:54.50]I didn't know if it was, like, scale meant volume, too.
[21:02.61]That's so... Are you kidding?
[21:05.62]Alright, now do a backflip.
[21:19.27]Oh, he's gone.
[21:20.41]There he goes.
[21:23.33]Why is there a backflip animation?
[21:28.28]Why not?
[21:29.24]That's true, why not?
[21:29.94]Oh, yeah!
[21:30.40]Fucking... Christ!
[21:32.10]Sorry.
[21:32.46]There's a spooky boy.
[21:34.20]There's a spooky boy.
[21:36.40]Oh, I thought you were holding your ribs, like, oh, my rib cage.
[21:40.06]Alright, can I, like, get on top of him?
[21:45.15]Oh, it's a Daisy.
[21:47.33]You know what?
[21:48.05]There are some avatars that you can ride on.
[21:51.41]You can, uh, you can put seats on avatars that you make.
[21:56.53]permission to use one of ace j's avatars to demonstrate which one is it the hot dog I'm getting some information it could be yeah really big josh um we'll let ace j we could let ace j pull out the hot dog so why okay why does that tracer have an Iron Man thing your tracer doesn't have an Iron Man thing because I wanted I wanted double denim double denim
[22:26.21]Yeah.
[22:29.31]We had like an 80s, 90s night in VR.
[22:32.85]Oh, that's actually awesome.
[22:37.82]I wanted double denim.
[22:40.42]Can I get double denim on the scout?
[22:42.68]OK.
[22:43.48]Yes.
[22:43.82]That could be possible.
[22:44.78]We could probably have someone make that.
[22:46.70]Nice.
[22:48.60]Give me like 10 minutes.
[22:51.16]Give me 10.
[22:51.44]Who said give me 10 minutes?
[22:53.64]Me.
[22:54.78]My IQ right here.
[22:56.33]The talent is unbelievable.
[22:57.77]Give me ten minutes.
[22:58.55]That would take me like five days.
[22:59.87]No, first of all, that would take me like three months to read how to do it, and then it would take me like three weeks to actually do it.
[23:09.59]Oh, goodness.
[23:10.93]Okay.
[23:11.29]Okay.
[23:11.45]Sorry.
[23:11.65]I don't want to scare you or anything, Kibo, but I would... Don't turn around.
[23:16.44]Do not turn around.
[23:17.16]No, no, no.
[23:17.88]Just like... Okay.
[23:19.86]Is he gone?
[23:21.32]Nope.
[23:22.57]No, he's still there.
[23:23.91]Get him away from me!
[23:26.03]Get him away from me!
[23:27.81]Just give him a hand.
[23:28.55]Oh, there's someone else there.
[23:30.63]Yeah, don't come around now.
[23:32.25]Get him away from me!
[23:33.73]Get him away from me!
[23:35.03]I'm gonna cry!
[23:35.85]If I can see him, I'm gonna fucking cry!
[23:38.38]Monkey?
[23:39.62]Open your mouth!
[23:40.48]Open your mouth!
[23:42.70]Open your mouth!
[23:45.24]Open your mouth!
[23:46.66]Open your mouth and go away!
[23:53.89]I want to go in his mouth!
[23:54.73]Kill him!
[23:55.03]Open your mouth, just like drink something!
[23:56.79]Even if it's trade!
[23:58.05]He got him.
[23:58.61]Oh, I damn it.
[24:00.09]That's Bob.
[24:00.59]Right?
[24:00.73]Oh, he's back!
[24:18.17]Where?
[24:19.39]I'm not crazy, he was just there.
[24:21.37]Your music stopped playing.
[24:22.47]You may want this good sir, in case he comes back.
[24:25.13]Oh, there you go.
[24:26.09]Oh, give me that, yeah.
[24:26.99]Thank you.
[24:27.57]Oh, sir.
[24:28.17]Oh, he's gone.
[24:29.65]Oh, I'm sorry.
[24:30.47]I didn't know I had to grip it.
[24:31.95]Yeah.
[24:32.23]When he comes back, I'm jamming this in his eye.
[24:36.12]Is somebody playing Seal right now?
[24:43.87]Oh, behind you.
[24:44.95]Look down.
[24:45.43]Look down.
[24:45.97]It's a classic from Batman Forever.
[25:06.03]Batman and Robin is a good movie.
[25:08.65]Everyone says it's terrible.
[25:09.91]But Batman and Robin... No, Batman and Robin and Batman and... the other one.
[25:14.28]I've forgotten.
[25:14.90]Forever.
[25:15.36]Batman and the other one.
[25:17.96]Batman and that guy with the underwear on.
[25:21.44]And Charles.
[25:22.44]This is Charles.
[25:23.18]SHUT UP!
[25:23.86]SHUT UP!
[25:27.08]Alright, uh, so we want you to death run?
[25:29.55]You want to do some death run?
[25:31.41]Death run?
[25:31.81]Oh, don't look at it!
[25:32.53]That's CP!
[25:34.42]Every time we go there, it's completely different.
[25:36.36]No, you have to keep looking.
[25:40.02]Yeah, just, uh, I would say decline all friend requests and, um, invite requests.
[25:45.88]That's actually fucking kind of scary.
[26:09.94]Oh.
[26:11.53]Wait, you actually died.
[26:14.91]Oh, fuck, I did die.
[26:19.13]Sick avatar, man.
[26:20.95]Even somebody that has the guy that sits at the fire, that's a fucking fantastic avatar.
[26:27.15]AFK?
[26:27.23]Hold up.
[26:40.23]AFK!
[26:40.31]Can I get that- can I get that avatar?
[26:43.19]Why are they- are they AFK?
[26:44.41]Excuse me.
[26:44.67]Leave him alone.
[26:46.76]I think he's being a beating.
[26:47.90]Bring him a tweet.
[26:48.64]Oh, you can actually flap the ears too.
[27:07.97]It's like the, uh, the animation.
[27:10.19]So if you, um, you have a few finger animations on your touchpad.
[27:14.93]Why is Thanos doing that?
[27:16.77]And so, like, basically any avatar you make, you can remap, you can remap those to any animation on the avatar.
[27:22.34]So, like, the trumpet I had was mapped to one of those.
[27:24.94]It's endgame, man.
[27:25.78]What is going on?
[27:28.06]We're in the endgame.
[27:29.76]Oh, this is what happens?
[27:32.20]Yep.
[27:32.42]This is what happens when you get, uh, ant excited about it.
[27:37.43]He really contorts his legs a bit, you know?
[27:39.83]He's trying to get Ant-Man out of there.
[27:46.65]This is just Taffy Paul Thanos.
[27:51.39]I feel like he's gonna be delicious and he's gonna be wrapped up in individual wrappers in a candy store.
[28:00.41]Dude, oddly satisfying, man.
[28:06.30]You could stare at that thing for hours.
[28:13.12]I opened up that video.
[28:14.95]Who am I talking to?
[28:17.47]I'm just like in my own world.
[28:21.01]There are people in chat, and there are a bunch of people here, and I was just talking to myself.
[28:26.55]Open the VRChat.
[28:29.55]You get the picture.
[28:30.89]We don't interact with anybody but ourselves.
[28:33.71]It's a lovely phenomenon.
[28:36.05]We go here to escape social interaction by socially interacting with ourselves.
[28:41.33]No one else?
[28:41.95]That's brilliant.
[28:45.39]Go me.
[28:46.22]I would just mute the microphone and just stand in a corner and just start talking to myself.
[28:51.46]That's what I do on a daily basis.
[28:55.48]I don't know where my mind goes.
[28:57.80]I just do stuff.
[28:59.20]This is so unsettling to me that it's hard to look.
[29:18.29]I don't know what it is.
[29:20.61]All these crazy scary characters and you were like a burnt monster and I cannot look at Beaker.
[29:27.96]That's where I draw the line.
[29:29.02]I can't look at him.
[29:31.68]Please look at me.
[29:32.78]Please.
[29:33.30]You look like the people that are in my dreams.
[29:35.84]Like, when you look at a person in a dream, they look like this.
[29:38.43]Thank you.
[29:39.55]He's the one that gets it.
[29:40.95]No one else gets me when I make these things.
[29:43.21]No one gets me.
[29:44.39]This is what a person's face looks like when I dream.
[29:46.99]Yeah.
[29:47.47]You don't understand what I'm saying?
[29:50.33]No, it does.
[29:50.73]It really does.
[29:51.30]That looks like a human in a dream.
[29:54.48]I'm sorry.
[29:55.42]That's amazing.
[29:56.06]That's incredible.
[29:59.78]The Ace has an amazing imagination.
[30:02.68]He made this one too.
[30:04.04]Speaking of things, you're using his glue model again.
[30:06.98]Wake up, people are saying.
[30:08.44]Oh my god, it really is.
[30:11.10]I had this dream where this guy looked like this.
[30:19.93]Yeah, hold on ace made some other rabbit, let me show you one of the other ones it's made What are you sure?
[30:25.68]Oh my god
[30:45.41]He made that, yeah.
[30:46.07]That is unbelievable.
[30:47.13]You gotta give us the whole thing.
[30:49.17]You gotta give us the whole thing.
[30:52.33]Oh, I don't have a memory.
[30:53.85]You're gonna need to clone this one.
[30:55.60]I'm talking about, like, turn around.
[30:58.38]Oh, turn around.
[30:58.96]I don't want to, like, I don't want any lines or something.
[31:01.32]It took a little bit of creative liberties.
[31:04.04]See, these are superhero spandex, okay?
[31:06.51]They're not just any other spandex.
[31:08.59]These are made to go in fires.
[31:11.00]They're made to explode.
[31:12.78]Let me tell you, you'll never have a wet dream.
[31:18.74]So we've got fire.
[31:19.82]Was that bad?
[31:21.48]It's freezing.
[31:22.57]And then the truck is going to fall.
[31:25.41]I meant urine.
[31:26.71]I meant urine.
[31:27.75]I meant urine.
[31:28.93]I meant urine.
[31:29.41]You know, sometimes at night, you may have had a little too much milk.
[31:32.53]It's the dream guy.
[31:36.49]I'm sorry.
[31:37.75]I'm sorry.
[31:38.59]I'm sorry.
[31:39.37]This is actually unbelievable, though.
[31:41.17]This is like, I'm clapping.
[31:43.15]There's more.
[31:43.69]I'll let Ace show us.
[31:44.93]Yeah, you can hear it.
[31:46.15]Do you want to show them off, Ace, or do you want me to load them?
[31:49.11]I mean, either way.
[31:50.03]I can show some of them.
[31:51.99]Yeah.
[31:52.91]Let's see which one you got there.
[31:57.72]I just realized what I said.
[31:59.60]I'm sorry.
[32:00.32]Wait.
[32:04.73]Wipe his pain!
[32:06.27]I hate- Wash your teeth if you want, not go to fucking jail, kids.
[32:13.10]I'm- I am floored right now, that's unbelievable.
[32:16.70]That is unbelievable.
[32:19.86]Hey, Shaddix.
[32:22.08]Wipe his pain!
[32:24.37]Oh my god, I thought there was another one behind me.
[32:27.93]Now, sorry.
[32:30.87]I mean, there could be.
[32:31.75]And then, uh, is this the... There's more?
[32:34.38]I can't believe there's one.
[32:35.62]This is fucking insane.
[32:36.48]This is unbelievable.
[32:37.42]This one's broken a bit in full body, but it would work better for you.
[32:40.40]You can copy them, but they're not, um... Well, you gotta get close to it.
[32:46.29]Yeah, we had to keep, you know, we're doing stuff.
[32:54.22]Keeping around.
[32:55.70]Oh my god.
[32:56.84]Jesus Christ.
[33:00.06]Yeah, the sound's a little short on the distance.
[33:02.22]I don't know how fat they are.
[33:05.99]It's quite jiggly.
[33:10.49]Sorry, I'm in my menu.
[33:16.92]Alright, well, I don't even know where to start.
[33:25.66]Burn, do we want to do the rickety rant?
[33:28.02]Do you want to hold off on that?
[33:30.39]We don't have them, do we?
[33:31.81]Yeah, we have to hold off.
[33:34.11]We do?
[33:34.51]OK.
[33:36.37]So many rants.
[33:37.69]You put them in the pen.
[33:40.13]So can I be one of these, too?
[33:42.01]Yeah, you should be able to.
[33:43.29]You should be able to select and then clone.
[33:46.11]You might have to do it off of AceJ since he made it.
[33:48.40]Oh, here, hold on.
[33:49.64]There seems to be a buff at the bug or what, but... Oh, I think I got it.
[33:53.12]I got another one.
[33:54.72]One of us, yeah.
[33:55.52]As long as it's not grayed out, you should be able to.
[33:58.74]Yeah, it's loading.
[33:59.88]There you go.
[34:00.70]Yep, it is.
[34:01.94]You're right.
[34:02.52]Okay, so it's weird to make it work.
[34:06.03]I'm trying to think, which one is it?
[34:08.07]Nope, not that.
[34:08.83]It's, uh... Okay, so it's... On your right hand, it's the lower left of the touchpad.
[34:14.02]Lower left.
[34:17.74]Yeah, just kind of hold your tongue there.
[34:19.16]Swipe down.
[34:20.31]Kind of like near the bottom.
[34:21.53]Yeah, bottom.
[34:22.07]Sorry, straight down.
[34:22.71]Oh, I see.
[34:25.73]And you hold it with the trigger.
[34:27.93]But you can use the trigger and lock it in place.
[34:30.76]Yeah, so for example, so hit down, like hold, you don't have to click it.
[34:36.10]I can't help here.
[34:36.90]It's kind of loud.
[34:37.90]Yeah, you just, so you tap down on the touchpad and while you, oops, not that one.
[34:44.20]It's kind of loud.
[34:45.04]Why is that Shaggy?
[34:46.62]That's Shaggy from Mass Effect.
[34:48.70]What?
[34:50.32]It's Morten.
[34:51.60]No, this is my alien love child.
[34:53.78]Don't worry about it.
[34:54.44]That one alien was real, apparently.
[34:56.26]Is that actually... That's my kid, man.
[35:00.92]This is like stigma.
[35:03.10]I feel like this walked into the casino for the first time.
[35:05.26]And it's like... And I'm just like...
[35:13.59]We really need to get out of here, my friend is sleeping so hard.
[35:16.51]Oh god.
[35:16.71]This is so fucking cool.
[35:18.33]What was that?
[35:44.45]You almost ran into me.
[35:45.37]I don't want that.
[35:46.75]Oh, I'm sorry.
[35:47.75]I don't have any spatial awareness.
[35:49.17]I have spatial awareness issues.
[35:51.37]I can't, like... You should see how many times I walk into my walls.
[35:54.42]Okay, does the back look like the default Fortnite dance?
[36:02.91]Can everybody do it?
[36:05.11]Yeah, you can do it.
[36:06.09]Alright, there's a portal.
[36:07.59]We need to jump through it before it disappears.
[36:09.13]Alright, let's go.
[36:09.92]Yeah, it'll be fine for a second.
[36:11.90]Every time someone goes through, the timer resets, so just give it a second.
[36:16.02]I mean, you can go through whenever.
[36:16.98]Yep.
[36:17.06]Make sure you're looking forward when you walk in.
[36:23.56]Oh my goodness.
[36:29.58]This is seriously, okay, well, we got a second here.
[36:32.02]I was gonna tell you, you're over here.
[36:34.58]This is like, I can't, I can't believe, that little man, I don't even have time to react to say how awesome that was.
[36:40.14]Like, hell yeah.
[36:41.66]That was fucking so cool.
[36:46.14]Hey, I already fell for one of them.
[36:49.08]Uh, alright, so.
[36:51.84]Okay, alright, so.
[36:53.90]Nah, we don't need the music, do we?
[37:01.91]Rats should probably stick together.
[37:03.69]Yep, we're here.
[37:04.59]We're just waiting for everybody to get loaded.
[37:07.29]You guys are a whole squad.
[37:08.89]Okay, so if you wanted to be able to do the rat song on cue, like I said, on the right hand, it's kind of like near the bottom of the touchpad to the left.
[37:17.01]So, like, slide your thumb down until you hear it.
[37:19.77]Can you hear it?
[37:20.71]I can't hear it.
[37:22.33]Oh, because you're, okay, you're a new user, that's why I don't hear it.
[37:25.05]So if you have it playing, while your thumb's held down on there, hold the trigger on that hand.
[37:30.93]And then now, if you release everything, just hitting the trigger should play it.
[37:36.00]If you just press and hold the trigger, it should play it.
[37:37.96]Yeah, because it kind of saves, it saves whatever you're holding to the trigger, basically.
[37:44.74]Yeah.
[37:45.44]I'm actually going to enable your avatar so I can actually see everything you do.
[37:49.65]That's one of the other problems with the, um...
[37:52.34]If you're a new user, the game automatically kind of blocks everything you do from other users.
[37:58.70]That makes sense.
[38:00.55]Yeah, it basically keeps trolls from ruining the game.
[38:04.13]Alright, I think we have everyone here.
[38:07.53]Oh wait, no, we're still waiting for a couple.
[38:09.73]Oh, Shaddix is here, nice.
[38:12.98]Oh god, I really want to end all of you.
[38:15.06]I didn't do it.
[38:16.20]What was that?
[38:17.02]Oh my god, that was heinous.
[38:18.18]Why do I hear rats?
[38:18.94]Okay.
[38:19.06]There's too many rats!
[38:19.74]By all means, give me the match we'll end.
[38:41.27]We're going to play death run.
[38:42.25]Do you know how death run works?
[38:43.25]I don't know how it works.
[38:45.01]I've never played it.
[38:46.41]This wall will disappear ahead of us.
[38:48.47]We'll run up this building, up the ramps, and try not to die.
[38:51.04]There's someone that's trying to set traps.
[38:53.02]So just avoid the traps if you can.
[38:54.80]I don't know what the traps are.
[38:55.98]I've never played this one.
[38:57.42]I remember.
[38:58.44]How do you jump?
[39:07.08]He's going to get through the whole thing.
[39:10.72]What happened?
[39:11.14]Did I die?
[39:13.22]Yeah.
[39:14.36]What killed me?
[39:14.94]I hate it.
[39:15.52]What?
[39:17.54]Oh.
[39:17.94]Yeah.
[39:18.26]What happened?
[39:19.53]What is that?
[39:20.61]Oh, they're upstairs, yeah.
[39:23.53]Oh, here they come.
[39:25.29]Oh.
[39:40.10]Can I, like, activate this trap?
[39:42.42]Uh, but we just watched.
[39:44.12]Yeah, we can't.
[39:47.21]So somebody's gonna, he's gonna get crushed, right?
[39:48.31]Somebody died, we can only watch.
[39:49.57]He's gonna get squished.
[39:51.21]Oh my god.
[39:52.95]I don't know.
[39:53.83]Kagan's making a run for it.
[39:54.95]Kagan's running for it, yeah.
[39:58.73]I got an annoying request from Mimer.
[40:00.89]What happened?
[40:01.47]But he didn't have the numbers by his name.
[40:03.07]Oh, he must have been behind.
[40:05.21]I got it!
[40:07.35]Not on you.
[40:10.14]I think this is what it feels like to live inside of a YouTube poop.
[40:15.70]If I was gonna rent, like, a YouTube poop apartment, it would be this, right?
[40:20.41]Yeah.
[40:20.75]Pretty much, yeah.
[40:22.19]Yeah.
[40:22.59]In a nutshell.
[40:23.31]It's, um... You get used to it.
[40:26.81]This is awesome.
[40:27.67]No, you don't.
[40:29.85]No.
[40:30.05]You don't ever get used to it.
[40:31.37]What's going on up there?
[40:34.19]Hold on, let me... Did anyone survive?
[40:38.47]I don't know.
[40:39.43]I can't find a plan.
[40:40.29]I thought it was a parkour game.
[40:42.17]Of course Shaggy has to win.
[40:42.93]How many floors are there?
[40:44.25]What the hell was that?
[41:07.48]It just happened when we teleported into the match, I don't know
[41:29.76]Did I get everyone?
[41:31.31]Yeah, I think so.
[41:31.89]Okay, yeah, now I see.
[41:32.75]I didn't make it.
[41:45.26]How come?
[41:46.34]I think that's it.
[41:48.36]I think that's it.
[41:49.22]The first gamer neck.
[41:51.70]No, you gotta hit the end button.
[41:53.22]That's like super self-aware gamer neck.
[41:55.75]On the bottom floor, yeah, sorry.
[41:58.29]That looks crazy.
[42:00.93]I didn't do it right?
[42:02.75]Shaggy's got a gamer neck.
[42:03.83]Shaggy has the original gamer neck.
[42:15.10]Alright, do it again?
[42:16.28]What happened?
[42:16.86]Oh, I can't- I can't turn the music on.
[42:20.32]No, you can mute it.
[42:22.24]Yeah, I think you can.
[42:23.90]Oh, thank god.
[42:25.50]I like this song.
[42:26.22]Oh, thank god.
[42:27.30]I like the music.
[42:29.13]It might have been loud.
[42:30.15]Are we all ready?
[42:31.41]I think we're all here.
[42:34.09]I think we're all ready.
[42:35.23]Yep.
[42:35.37]Whoa!
[42:44.96]I'll go first.
[42:51.64]I'll clear the first trap so that way no one else dies.
[42:55.62]I got this.
[42:56.12]Okay.
[42:56.60]Okay.
[42:56.98]Sounds good.
[42:58.76]Switch to the hot dog avatar.
[43:02.46]Is that a duck?
[43:06.62]I'm going to fall off and die already.
[43:11.30]Just kind of stay in the middle.
[43:12.80]Be careful.
[43:14.61]That's me!
[43:15.43]That's me!
[43:15.83]That's me!
[43:17.03]We fell because we were too slow last time.
[43:18.72]We gotta hurry.
[43:20.52]Socks?
[43:21.46]Socks got blown off!
[43:23.18]Socks!
[43:23.72]Socks!
[43:24.36]Socks!
[43:29.21]What is this?
[43:29.87]What is this?
[43:30.27]What is that?
[43:30.63]How is getting Shrek the verb?
[43:31.41]Oh!
[43:31.47]What happened?
[43:32.37]What?
[43:57.09]because I felt like you don't have time to give up.
[44:00.07]Yeah, I think they did shorten the timer, because you used to have a lot more time to run.
[44:04.13]I got scared.
[44:05.99]I got scared.
[44:06.87]I had to... What happened to the old guy?
[44:11.39]I was waiting for the thing to reset.
[44:14.03]Oh, um, do you want to have a look over there?
[44:16.45]Oh, okay, yeah, no problem.
[44:17.29]I don't want to beat you.
[44:18.19]I want to beat you.
[44:27.36]What are you right now?
[44:28.62]What is he for you?
[44:30.10]Oh my avatars are loading.
[44:33.18]Oh my god And then one of the other buttons should be the life is pain Need to brush your teeth You left-handed or right-handed
[44:53.44]Uhm, onomatopoeia - whatever it's called. What's it called?
[44:57.44]Ambidextrous.
[45:16.90]I guess I can see through everything.
[45:17.41]Pick a buddy, we need to school it up.
[45:18.75]This is too much.
[45:19.61]Ace chase my buddy, ace chase my buddy, ace chase my buddy.
[45:37.40]I hate it.
[45:38.60]I hate it.
[45:40.20]It's Tommy Pickles.
[45:41.10]That's Tommy Pickles.
[45:42.06]How do I be Tommy Pickles?
[45:44.03]Tommy Pickles.
[45:45.57]It's Tommy Pickles.
[45:46.57]I'm just kidding.
[45:47.29]What are you talking about?
[45:51.89]That's not Bobby Hill.
[45:52.85]That's Tommy Pickles from All Grown Up.
[45:55.77]The new series that they did and it failed after like four episodes.
[45:58.97]It was awful.
[46:00.48]Rugrats in high school.
[46:01.64]I was 15 once, guys.
[46:03.46]I know old shows.
[46:05.30]And then I had an exam.
[46:07.46]Can you make an avatar from all grown up building a birdcage?
[46:13.94]Like, all grown up, dummy.
[46:16.12]Yeah, I tend to be good ones, though.
[46:18.14]That would be such an obscure reference.
[46:21.22]Like, it would be nice.
[46:22.40]Who would even know who you were?
[46:23.52]I forgot you made this one.
[46:24.95]No, Shaggy.
[46:26.38]Sheesh, why are you calling me Scooby suddenly?
[46:28.76]Sorry, well, it's, you know, from Scooby-Doo.
[46:31.37]What?
[46:31.81]What are you trying to say, man?
[46:33.33]What are you trying to say?
[46:35.13]You look a little, uh, different, Shaggy.
[46:37.13]When aliens land, we're gonna have a lot of explaining to do.
[46:42.73]Oh, man.
[46:43.21]Boink!
[46:43.95]Boink, boink, boink, boink, boink!
[46:45.55]Just, uh, do me a favor, don't fart.
[46:48.41]Alright.
[46:50.55]I mean, yeah.
[46:51.11]Do you guys up for another round?
[46:52.75]Is everybody... I love these shoes.
[46:54.55]Yeah, that's fine.
[46:55.47]I don't know.
[46:57.12]What other, like, games can you play?
[46:59.56]Yeah, I was going to say, there's a whole other variety.
[47:01.40]So if you go to your world's menu, there's a whole section if you scroll down for games.
[47:07.07]Oh, God.
[47:08.69]Yeah, you don't have to find one.
[47:10.51]There's a huge variety.
[47:12.29]Um... Wait, what is Steel in Uganda?
[47:14.07]Is that... is that... What did we just go?
[47:15.89]Did I just go somewhere?
[47:16.55]Uh-oh, I left the team.
[47:17.19]I think I left the team.
[47:18.07]Did I leave the team?
[47:19.19]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[47:19.73]This is supposed to be Safari.
[47:20.69]I'm supposed to be like on a tour guide.
[47:22.33]I think I left everybody.
[47:23.53]I think I'm going to... I don't know where to go.
[47:39.34]I wandered off from the tour group, I think.
[47:42.48]Hello?
[47:45.68]I'm gonna get eaten by a lion out here.
[47:49.69]There was, there was like a pool over here.
[47:52.25]And there was like rhinoceroses and hippos and shit and I got out of the cart and I like went in real close and then they drove off without me.
[48:06.20]What?
[48:06.84]What happened?
[48:08.10]Get me back in the car.
[48:08.74]Well, I guess I'm just gonna hit the button.
[48:10.16]Oh, fuck me.
[48:11.04]Well, I know Ace is in there, so... Goodbye!
[48:17.26]This doesn't... Nothing about that looks right.
[48:19.02]This is all... I don't understand.
[48:23.12]...so bizarre.
[48:24.90]Shaddix, no!
[48:27.48]It has potential... It has potential of getting weird, dude.
[48:30.74]Don't worry.
[48:31.02]Oh, I can imagine.
[48:31.54]He's broken.
[48:35.14]I'm getting a noise complaint tonight.
[48:55.15]Shrek got me, man.
[48:56.77]Shrek got me.
[48:58.63]The bridge got me.
[49:01.09]I don't know what happened.
[49:02.66]The whole floor just left me.
[49:04.50]I kind of just disappeared and fell into the aether, started contemplating my existence.
[49:08.86]It was... Oh well.
[49:10.28]They're quite compact.
[49:12.85]Before I got crushed by a piano, I just looked up... Oh, these.
[49:15.53]How old are you?
[49:22.46]I just want to make, I just want to clarify, I mean, you got a receding hairline, I'm not sure, you know, some people.
[49:28.76]40.
[49:30.44]40, okay.
[49:31.64]Alright, old five, listen up.
[49:33.26]These straps kind of look as old as you.
[49:34.94]Alright, these things get a little kinky.
[49:39.28]Alright, alright, alright.
[49:40.50]It's a couple of straps that, you know, I get PTSD every now and then.
[49:44.54]Yeah, but you get stuck in them.
[49:46.62]I kind of do, it's a problem.
[49:49.14]So if I ever start screaming for help,
[49:52.10]Oh, what, dude?
[49:53.42]It's, uh, Marty McFly, you know?
[49:55.86]Got a puffer vest.
[49:56.60]Oh!
[49:56.66]Oh!
[49:56.76]Oh, yeah.
[49:56.96]Yeah, uh.
[50:04.79]You know, when she's just displacing her time all the time, I have to call different time zones, you know, different dates, like the 80s called, you know, and sometimes you gotta get, you know, 2000s, the 90s, the 70s, you know, it's just all over the place.
[50:20.18]You have no idea what it's like.
[50:21.66]I like the ultimate warrior on the eyes there.
[50:24.08]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[50:24.90]You know, it's a spirit.
[50:26.22]It's being moved.
[50:32.98]You know, if I can't really change anything over here, I gotta amplify it up here.
[50:37.20]Are you a golf?
[50:38.64]Is that golf?
[50:41.74]Oh, I'm a monkey.
[50:44.37]You know, it's just there.
[50:47.19]You never removed it, you know?
[50:48.99]Just a monkey.
[50:50.97]I'm sorry.
[50:52.29]I think you were asking about the dancing or backflipping earlier.
[50:55.90]I don't know, I'm a monkey.
[50:57.32]How am I supposed to know?
[51:01.89]If you're too slow, Jimmy Neutron's dad chases you down.
[51:08.04]Wait, is that, what?
[51:09.06]That's not a person doing that?
[51:11.58]No.
[51:12.00]I thought that was one of you guys.
[51:14.36]Jimbo!
[51:15.98]Hey, Jimmy!
[51:16.82]Jimbo!
[51:19.24]Oh, you can hear it.
[51:23.86]What is this?
[51:25.18]It's the future.
[51:27.46]The emotes earlier, like the backflip.
[51:29.38]If you want a backflip, you... Yeah, sorry.
[51:34.44]You open the menu and emote in the bottom, and then you can select from a bunch of built-in emotes.
[51:40.36]Backflip is like, yeah.
[51:41.59]Die.
[51:41.81]Yep.
[51:41.93]Backflip!
[51:43.31]Yep.
[51:43.67]Yeah!
[51:44.27]Oh!
[51:51.98]Alright, do a little jig.
[51:54.65]Do a jig for us.
[51:55.65]You know, a little dance.
[51:56.73]Let's see it.
[51:57.27]Oh, my frame rate just died.
[51:59.47]Ah, there we go!
[52:00.67]Yeah, move those hips, baby!
[52:02.51]Default VR dance.
[52:03.83]There we go.
[52:06.31]Oh, that was really bad.
[52:08.53]You still got it in you.
[52:10.01]Hey, Ty, no.
[52:11.07]No.
[52:11.97]No.
[52:13.17]No.
[52:13.89]It's just the nose wipe.
[52:14.69]Don't worry.
[52:16.31]It's just wiping his nose.
[52:17.65]I could try to join in, but...
[52:20.04]I promise it will look a little weird, baby.
[52:22.55]This is like the best dream I've ever had.
[52:25.69]It really is.
[52:26.29]Watch what?
[52:27.23]Yeah, the wheelchair dance is something else.
[52:33.04]I got some...
[52:34.86]One of those things called shocks or something, you know, in cars, would make you... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:40.28]I don't know.
[52:40.86]I got those installed recently, so... I draw it.
[52:44.58]I draw it.
[52:45.20]Yeah, yeah, I draw it.
[52:46.48]It's on lowriders.
[52:48.34]They have what are called airbags.
[52:49.42]They're cushions that can be inflated or deflated.
[52:51.44]Never mind.
[52:52.10]Never mind.
[52:56.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:24.67]This is the future.
[53:25.41]Take it in.
[53:27.81]Yes!
[53:30.07]Are they gonna teach us in school?
[53:32.93]Oh, okay.
[53:34.51]Alright, alright.
[53:36.25]That happened.
[53:37.17]We could do murder.
[53:39.07]I wanna do murder.
[53:39.78]School's gonna be like this.
[53:41.96]School's gonna be like this.
[53:42.92]What would you like to do next?
[53:45.78]Look at your face.
[54:00.57]Your teacher your teacher 50 years in the future is gonna be solid snake in a wheelchair Wow
[54:12.17]I think I need like a bit of a cool down metal That can make you just sit for a while that'll work right and we could do scuff or I was or what about the GTA apartments I
[54:38.84]The GTA apartments are a good time.
[54:42.60]Oh no.
[54:42.88]Oh, okay.
[54:43.64]It's gonna be school.
[54:44.52]The house that hungers.
[54:46.34]I don't think we- I don't think we should- I mean, do you want to go to a school?
[54:51.94]Uh... I don't think they'd accept a man like him at a school, let's be honest.
[54:56.22]I think they'd probably have a sort of distant, like, bigot set place for him not to be around the parameters, like...
[55:03.93]A couple miles.
[55:05.33]Oh!
[55:05.89]Oh no, he died!

[56:13.45]If you wanna, if you wanna make portals though, you gotta go through that door over there.
[56:17.27]And then you can jump on it.
[56:18.41]That looks fucking amazing.
[56:19.22]That's the weird thing about this map.
[56:21.64]That's what Bluebeard really should be like.
[56:24.70]Yeah, you should just fall off.

[56:59.55]Invite only is only me is the thing.
[57:00.65]Would you call me?
[57:22.69]Did you call me Admiral Ackbar?
[57:24.14]I said that that's like the inspiration.
[57:25.82]I just figured it out right now.
[57:27.24]They got inspiration from Admiral Ackbar.
[57:28.44]I'm not Admiral Ackbar!
[57:29.96]No, no, no, you're not Admiral Ackbar.
[57:31.30]You're Grunt from, what's his name?
[57:34.36]It's a trap.
[57:34.96]Oh, you didn't call me Rex.
[57:36.29]Oh, my God.
[57:36.99]I was going to say Rex.
[57:38.45]Yeah, Grunt from Mass Effect.
[57:39.75]What?
[57:44.25]I'm just saying, my brain just saw it.
[57:47.31]Admiral Ackbar is a fantastic character, first of all.
[57:49.85]It just really is.
[57:51.17]Well, I mean, he is.
[57:52.37]He's great.
[57:52.91]I agree.
[57:54.31]That's where they got the inspiration for the character.
[57:57.78]Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[58:01.00]It's fine.
[58:01.46]It's fine.
[58:02.34]Oh, my God.
[58:05.08]That wasn't fucking cool.
[58:06.96]Like I said, that wasn't fucking cool.
[58:08.84]He does IRL sound effects.
[58:10.12]I got you, man.
[58:10.82]I got you.
[58:11.73]You gotta admit it.
[58:12.35]I got you.
[58:14.21]That hurt.
[58:14.67]I don't appreciate getting hit in the face like that.
[58:16.31]I don't appreciate it.
[58:17.43]I'm gonna get it back, don't worry.
[58:27.22]I'm gonna get grabbed by that thing.
[58:50.82]I thought we were doing the GTA apartment.
[58:53.96]Where's this?
[59:00.45]Hello.
[59:01.21]Hello!
[59:05.17]Getting right into character, huh?
[59:07.53]A little bit, just slightly, I think.
[59:11.29]Beautiful place you've got here.
[59:12.66]Wonderful stuff.
[59:13.40]We're just going to be here for a while to chill out, so feel free to hang out wherever.
[59:16.34]Okay, I'll try to find a bridge.
[59:18.75]pictures and all these things.
[59:20.25]Who's this, your son?
[59:22.27]Whose kid is this?
[59:23.71]Whose kid is this?
[59:24.45]This is the lunch table over here, okay, for all of us.
[59:27.39]This is the lunch table.
[59:29.64]This is our... This is the kids' table.
[59:32.58]Guess I'll take it.
[59:34.54]This is the kids' table at the Applebee's over here.
[59:36.64]Right.
[59:38.22]Alright.
[59:41.52]Hey, I... I...
[59:50.71]Okay, anybody looking for a drink?
[59:52.47]Anybody want a drink?
[59:53.23]Drink?
[59:53.89]Yeah, a bottle of your finest Elmer's, please.
[59:56.75]Elmer's, yeah.
[59:57.61]Okay, that sounds good to me.
[60:01.64]Do you want that from the window?
[60:06.02]Can I get some rose water over here?
[60:08.94]What are you talking about?
[60:12.00]Oh, there we go.
[60:12.72]Don't know why it's pink.
[60:14.05]I guess it's like the glitter kind.
[60:15.77]Yes, it's a barker.
[60:16.99]And for some reason we're having trouble here.
[60:19.71]Something's happening.
[60:20.43]Can I get some rose water down here?
[60:21.95]Man, this bartender sucks, guys.
[60:25.14]That's a good one.
[60:27.32]I like when people make toast.

[60:37.92]I'm going to reorder it.
[60:38.92]We'll reorder it myself.
[60:40.26]Vern, you need some help up?
[60:42.16]Okay.
[60:43.16]Everyone.
[60:43.55]No, it's fine.
[60:45.04]Just give me, like, the heavy stuff.
[60:46.91]Is that what they call it?
[60:47.73]I'm not very... Just call me heavy.
[60:50.50]I'm talking to my... Yeah, I can...
[60:57.33]I'm not talking about the liquor.
[60:58.69]Not yet.
[60:59.17]Can you give me that bottle right behind you?
[61:02.81]The one on the left right there, I don't think those are decorative ones that are glued to the ceiling.
[61:08.03]I don't know the table Bartender bartender the bottles right there to your left Thank you, thank you, thank you
[61:30.48]That's awful.

[61:33.49]You don't like poison?
[61:34.41]That's terrible.
[61:36.33]What?
[61:36.89]Is this different?
[61:37.93]This is different stuff, right?
[61:39.07]This is all we got.
[61:39.93]This is all we... Okay.
[61:42.71]Alright, that's enough.
[61:43.74]Let's go out here.
[61:44.52]What are you doing behind the bar?
[61:45.72]What are you doing behind the bar?
[61:49.04]Organizing.
[61:49.80]The guy in the wheelchair is...
[61:52.60]They said it was free drinks.
[61:55.26]Ah, free.
[61:56.26]I've been waiting here for a while and I noticed your bar.
[62:00.42]I put it in your cup holder.
[62:02.28]No, those aren't cup holders.
[62:04.40]How are you doing?
[62:06.28]Just wanted a drink.
[62:11.13]He just drank my drink.
[62:14.61]What are you doing?
[62:16.17]Have you ever seen the Marblelympics?
[62:19.13]I don't know where I'm from.
[62:21.51]I'm just doing it.
[62:23.11]No, I don't want to make Digimon.
[62:26.05]This is like Kingdom Hearts.
[62:27.93]But that's, uh, OC Kingdom Hearts.
[62:32.00]So how does alcohol, like, uh, work with the glue?
[62:35.45]What are you talking about?
[62:37.41]How does that work out?
[62:38.89]I was just working with it.
[62:41.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:43.05]I don't know how to say it.
[62:45.67]I've got a liver.
[62:46.85]I've got a liver.
[62:47.59]It doesn't work very well because it's made out of glue.
[62:49.61]Hey, cheers, bro.
[62:50.79]Cheers.
[62:51.25]Cheers.
[62:51.75]Are you going to work your liver like I got working legs, buddy?
[62:55.22]You know what I'm going to do with you?
[62:56.80]No, excuse me.
[62:57.46]Hold on.
[62:57.92]Excuse me.
[62:58.76]I'm gonna get you on the table over there, and I'm gonna give you an arm wrestling match.
[63:01.82]You're strong, Admiral Ackbar.
[63:03.04]I'm just gonna give you a hit.
[63:03.82]Oh, I bet so.
[63:04.86]Ah, okay.
[63:05.50]Let me take a big hit.
[63:09.36]Okay.
[63:10.94]Okay.
[63:12.26]We need to find a smaller table.
[63:13.56]This table's way too big.
[63:14.70]This coffee table over here is probably the best one.
[63:19.41]It's a bit short.
[63:20.65]I don't think we could really arm wrestle on it.
[63:22.09]It's like kind of short unless you want to like sit on our knees.
[63:24.99]Okay.
[63:25.89]Okay, there's like there's puke all over the floor from earlier, but still I'm up for it.
[63:29.66]Yeah, yeah, just don't slip in the puke.
[63:33.76]Okay, go.
[63:34.24]Should we get everybody in here?
[63:40.22]Yeah, yeah.
[63:40.62]Okay.
[63:41.48]Got to make sure.
[63:42.22]Alright.
[63:43.31]I don't want a good flex for that one.
[63:46.01]Oh, what a great flex.
[63:49.43]Can I see your hands, please, before the match?
[63:56.29]I need to make sure you guys are using any lubricants.
[63:59.65]I need to make sure this sits hard.
[64:02.56]Ref, ref, if I may.
[64:04.32]I think there's glue on his hands, referee.
[64:08.91]What the hell?
[64:09.81]Hey!
[64:10.61]What the hell?
[64:12.09]What are you doing?
[64:13.85]Just hold on.
[64:14.29]You just stay there.
[64:16.21]Okay.
[64:18.35]Oh, fuck.

[64:25.74]Uh, yes.
[64:27.14]Work up a sweat quick.
[64:28.02]Can you start talking?
[64:28.88]No, no, no, no.
[64:29.66]The best way for me to work up a sweat is for you to tell me embarrassing stories.
[64:33.06]Here, here, here.
[64:33.66]Let me fix it.
[64:34.62]Let me fix it.
[64:35.46]No, don't talk to me.
[64:36.58]Don't talk to me.
[64:37.04]It's a bad idea.
[64:38.37]This is gonna hurt a lot.
[64:39.27]This is gonna hurt real bad.
[65:03.31]Oh god, oh.
[65:05.61]Oh god, Ref is dead.
[65:07.19]Okay, we'll just arm wrestle over his corpse, it's fine.
[65:09.77]Okay.
[65:10.19]Alright, let's go.
[65:11.41]Yeah, you can use the wheelchair back instead of the table.
[65:16.18]That's fine.
[65:17.10]I'm just gonna, I'll just rest right here for a bit.
[65:21.26]Alright, alright, let's get this over with, okay.

[66:55.87]Oh my god, it's like, it's really sprained, oh my god, look at it.
[67:00.00]You hurt your friends, you have to pretend to also get hurt too, so then like, you don't look like a bad person, you know what I mean?
[67:05.42]Like, that's what you're doing.
[67:06.68]What are you saying?
[67:08.28]What do you mean?
[67:09.10]You're saying you're not hurt?
[67:11.93]My hand is twisted.
[67:13.05]You have to pretend, you have to pretend that you're... But you're a glue person, how do you hurt something that you don't have?
[67:19.29]You're just glue.
[67:21.50]Hold on, hold on, I'll get your wrist back into position.
[67:23.92]Like, Blue Man, stand still.
[67:26.32]Give me your hand, okay?

[67:36.62]I think your man just... I think your man did some worse.
[67:43.54]Can you still move it?
[67:44.50]You can still move it, can you?
[67:45.68]Okay.
[67:46.50]Okay, you're fine, you're fine.

[67:52.87]I kind of... It gets... I got a chip of your bone on my hand.
[67:56.43]This piano doesn't have any keys connected.
[67:57.99]There's no... They're just flat.
[67:59.99]Yeah, it's... This is literally cardboard.
[68:02.79]I don't know if you noticed.
[68:03.94]All of the furniture here, it's just kind of fake.
[68:07.32]I'm just going to assume you don't want this little piece of your bone that I got when I put your hand back into place.
[68:13.24]What are you saying?
[68:18.19]Monkey in the kitchen.
[68:22.21]Cookie, go away.
[68:25.18]What do we have here?

[68:35.00]There's a shower.
[68:35.48]I need a shower.
[68:36.88]There's puke all over me.
[68:37.66]Alright, I'll show the cop.
[68:48.41]Where'd he go?
[68:49.23]Did you just teleport?
[68:51.27]Wait.

[69:30.57]Oh, there you are.
[69:31.99]Oh, what's in there?

[69:36.11]Oh, it's gone.
[69:39.43]There's a whole arsenal over here if you want in the closet here.
[69:43.73]Oh, we got a Shacoosie.

[69:48.65]Cool.
[69:49.67]I found the bath.
[69:50.71]Yes, nice.
[69:51.49]Hot tub.
[69:52.45]Oh, cool.
[69:55.07]Ow.
[69:56.19]You sure you should be in there?
[69:58.51]You made it, glue.
[69:59.67]Oh, that fucking hurts.
[70:00.75]Okay.
[70:01.79]Yeah, I'm fine.
[70:04.64]Don't worry.
[70:05.66]Okay.
[70:06.62]Thank you.
[70:15.54]That one guy that's in the hot tub for the whole party I
[70:45.39]Wait, is this an ambush?
[70:49.51]I mean, we have the arsenal out here.
[70:52.97]Mine are?
[70:58.46]Oh, it's so bad.
[71:01.66]Ow.
[71:03.95]Ow.
[71:06.13]It's a hot tub, Q. Hey.
[71:07.73]Hey, come on, man.
[71:10.35]The water's so fine in here, everyone's great!
[71:12.79]I'm the only guy at the party that's the only guy that goes to the hot tub!
[71:25.44]Oh, wow.
[71:26.20]I really need it.
[71:27.64]I'm still... Oh my god, what are you doing?
[71:29.95]Get up!
[71:30.59]Up!
[71:31.05]Oh my god!
[71:33.39]You're drowning yourself!
[71:35.33]Oh, she fell asleep?
[71:36.19]Aw, man.
[71:37.83]Oh, you need to chill out, man.
[71:39.57]You could have drowned.
[71:40.37]That's not good.
[71:41.11]You know, drowning's pretty bad.
[71:42.95]Oh, God.
[71:43.51]I can't drown.
[71:44.03]I don't have any more.
[71:44.49]My ankle's cramping.
[71:45.53]My calf.
[71:46.21]My calf.
[71:47.99]Alright.
[71:52.69]I was going to be, you know, I'm the only guy.
[71:54.93]I'm the guy that only goes in the hot tub when he's the only person in it.
[71:59.83]Come on.
[72:00.29]I'm pulling out.
[72:01.65]Yeah, that's my... Fuck, yeah.
[72:04.40]I think we might have lost him.
[72:06.54]People are enjoying themselves.
[72:08.96]I'd rather just sit in a corner alone.
[72:10.51]What's this?
[72:13.79]We just had a Krogan drown in the hot tub.
[72:16.71]Oh, wait.
[72:17.61]He's alive.
[72:18.05]We have to test if he's alive or not.
[72:19.77]Someone left their guns on the ground.
[72:22.31]Jesus, what did you slap?
[72:34.50]That's like fucking next level.
[72:35.80]I ain't doing that.
[72:36.36]Look at all these weapons.
[72:37.36]Whoa, where'd you get all these?
[72:38.60]Yeah, what the?
[72:39.66]I'm a collector.
[72:42.56]What?
[72:43.58]Wow.
[72:45.08]This is the part of the story.
[72:46.32]This is the part of the story where I come into your secret laboratory and you're surprised that I know the model numbers?
[72:53.76]What?
[72:54.12]I can't believe you have a T-145 too.
[72:55.18]How did you know that?
[72:58.76]You can't believe that.
[73:00.84]I can't believe that.
[73:05.96]Yeah, I hear another Krogan drowning in the top.
[73:09.88]Oh no, they're fakes.
[73:10.72]Oh.
[73:10.88]You mean they can't make a portal with this?
[73:16.62]Yeah.
[73:16.86]But they're so cool, though.
[73:18.07]I keep the fakes in the room, and the real things are somewhere else.
[73:20.07]Oh!
[73:33.40]Bro, always rack your weights, please.
[73:36.76]That one's real.
[73:38.20]It's unbelievable.
[73:40.40]Always rack your weights.
[73:41.76]People just leave shit around.
[73:44.68]Get out of my house!
[73:47.34]Get out of my house!
[73:49.46]What the fuck is going on in here?
[73:51.35]Get out!

[79:34.81]Hey, it's not even real.
[79:36.23]It's a fake thing.
[79:37.31]Don't listen to him.
[79:39.89]Put your hands up.
[79:40.57]Oh no, you're gonna shoot us.
[79:42.37]Oh, I'm scared.
[79:45.91]Keep your hands in the air.
[79:46.95]Just keep pretending.
[79:47.99]Oh my god, I'm so scared.
[79:53.00]You want a picture of my children?
[79:55.71]I'm robbing you.

[80:21.68]I have to talk really loud because I'm in this avatar.
[80:26.23]Yeah, I see that.
[80:26.97]Very nice.
[80:27.43]I found that.
[80:29.53]It looked very textured and fit.

[81:29.86]I'm talking to you.
[81:32.08]I don't know where they are.
[81:36.52]Sorry.
[81:37.82]I'm a quest giver.
[81:39.10]If you find me what I want, I will give you a prize.
[81:44.00]Come on, I'm doing a toddler.
[81:49.56]I'm just a little old man.
[81:57.81]Have you seen any figurines?
[82:00.67]Nope.
[82:00.83]Nope.
[82:01.23]I mean, that sounded like a lie.
[82:05.13]No.
[82:05.19]Actually, no.
[82:05.71]I don't know.
[82:07.05]Hey!
[82:27.81]Okay.
[82:30.37]Do you mind?
[82:31.69]What's wrong?
[82:32.07]What are you doing?
[82:35.35]Do you mind?
[82:36.11]Oh, okay.
[82:37.41]I knew I liked you.
[82:38.83]You're doing the only person in the bathtub thing.
[82:41.08]Right?
[82:41.74]I knew that.
[82:42.18]I thought you were cool.
[82:42.92]I knew it.
[82:43.24]Alright, close it.
[82:45.68]Just a monkey.
[82:46.52]I'm worried.
[82:47.92]He's got a fucking knife.
[82:49.58]Where's he got a knife?
[82:52.33]I don't question it, really.
[82:53.45]I don't.
[82:54.11]Why are you letting your son hold knives again?
[82:56.49]Remember what happened last time?
[82:57.79]Can you say something?
[83:00.49]I'm cooking.
[83:02.27]Oh, what the fuck is that?
[83:07.63]Gamer what?
[83:08.79]The gamer what?
[83:09.37]What?

[83:09.75]You got a little respect, huh?
[83:13.33]Come on.
[83:22.94]Get out of here.
[83:25.77]Oh, oh, oh, oh, right, right.
[83:27.91]Oh, shit.
[83:28.47]Sorry.
[83:29.09]I'm sorry.
[83:32.41]I'm not from here.
[83:33.63]I'm not from here.
[83:35.57]Yeah, clearly.
[83:38.82]Get it?
[83:39.66]Is your glue clearer?
[83:41.12]He's smiling.
[83:43.50]Alright, let's give it a round of applause.
[83:46.78]Round of applause, everybody.
[83:48.66]Thank you.
[83:50.00]Sorry.
[83:50.54]Great job.
[83:53.00]Oh, what the hell?
[83:54.14]What happened?
[83:55.44]Huh?
[83:55.92]I didn't help up the stairs.
[83:57.77]I-I'ma trust this guy.
[83:58.71]I gotta go.
[83:59.71]Okay, whoops, I hate this.
[84:01.27]Huh?
[84:04.81]Can I stop doing this?
[84:06.63]I didn't help you up the stairs.
[84:08.31]He- You know how fearful for my life I was?
[84:11.20]Hey.
[84:12.30]Hey, you.
[84:12.78]Hey, yeah, I went back.
[84:13.76]Wait, I won't carry.
[84:14.82]He literally repaired the ramp.
[84:17.06]Everything's fine.
[84:17.84]This is fine.
[84:18.70]This is fine.
[84:20.52]He repaired the ramp by saying yeet.
[84:23.92]I just didn't go up the stairs if you weren't there, and if he was there, and glue man didn't glue the ramp, and it broke down, and then... You did not do those things.
[84:38.78]No, so you're saying you did do the knock, is what you're saying, because I said you didn't repair the ramp, and you just said I did those things, so you're admitting that you did not do the things that you did, right?
[84:51.31]Oh wait, there's a needler?
[84:52.23]Yeah.
[84:52.47]Yeah, let's talk about that.
[84:54.11]Oh, oh, oh, that makes total sense.
[84:55.61]Okay, I'll grab it on the same page.
[84:56.95]I like the patches.
[84:57.81]Nice.
[84:57.95]Oh wait, which ones have I got on this one?
[84:59.99]You got Elmer's?
[85:00.63]Oh, yes.
[85:00.93]So, what affiliation are you?
[85:01.95]Are you Elmer's or Gorilla?
[85:15.03]Are you your own independent brand?
[85:16.59]You kind of working up at the place?
[85:17.95]Indie company?
[85:19.92]We're like a... We've got Pritt Stick.
[85:25.42]In the UK, we represent the Pritt Dick.
[85:28.56]Oh.
[85:29.54]That sounds kind of sexy.
[85:30.46]Yeah.
[85:31.14]But... Pritt?
[85:32.76]What?
[85:34.65]No, Pritt Stick.
[85:36.53]We use them in schools.
[85:37.99]Well, you said Pritt.
[85:39.45]That's sick.
[85:41.66]They should use it in school.
[85:42.78]T-R-I-T-T.
[85:44.16]Crit.
[85:44.82]And now it's that time of the day when the life of the party, you know, is something crazy.
[85:49.10]You know what I mean?
[85:50.74]Hold on.
[85:51.18]Oh, yeah.
[85:51.94]No, no, no, no.
[85:52.58]Yeah, another one.
[85:53.93]Into the water.
[85:55.01]Yeah, drink.
[85:56.41]Everybody drink.
[85:57.41]You stuck the landing.
[85:59.77]I'll have a drink.
[86:00.71]No, that's from Crowbar.
[86:01.85]Are you about to eat the Crowbar?
[86:04.31]That's not really a cool thing to do with a Crowbar, man.
[86:09.19]I've got my wine.
[86:10.51]So what else you got?
[86:11.83]Party tricks.
[86:13.03]What else can you do?
[86:14.91]Okay.
[86:15.47]I'm getting a little nervous.
[86:17.40]I'm getting a little nervous.
[86:19.32]Ooh, okay.
[86:21.02]Alright.
[86:22.82]Okay, maybe you want to put the crowbar down while you're having a little anxious.
[86:27.18]What's up?
[86:28.90]Knock someone out with it.
[86:30.47]Ladies and gentlemen.
[86:32.95]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Great Glue Man's Disappearing Trick Magic Show.
[86:40.06]I... What I have in my hand here... Thank you.
[86:43.94]Thank you.
[86:44.20]What I have in my hand here is a crowbar.
[86:46.54]Can somebody confirm that this is a crowbar?
[86:49.76]Um... Looks like a magnet?
[86:52.68]Hold up.
[86:53.66]Let me see.
[86:55.14]Let me see.
[86:56.40]Alright, you ready?
[86:57.50]Try it on the metal rods and see if it sticks like a magnet.
[87:00.16]If not, it's a crowbar.
[87:01.16]I didn't feel anything!
[87:07.17]So it's real.
[87:09.13]It's a grow bar.
[87:10.17]Yeah.
[87:11.91]And as you see here, it's real.
[87:16.59]Please don't talk.
[87:20.41]Don't stop talking.
[87:21.29]Someone's talking in there.
[87:22.01]It's distracting me.
[87:22.65]Stop talking.
[87:25.02]I'm a monkey.
[87:26.52]Wait, what?
[87:27.96]Jesus.
[87:29.12]You're ruining the magic show.
[87:32.06]You're ruining the movie.
[87:36.79]Um, like shut the fuck up.
[87:38.51]Um, okay.
[87:39.19]So, so here's my magic crowbar.
[87:42.42]And as you see here, all I have to do is swing it around a few times.
[87:48.58]You have a question?
[87:50.76]Yeah.
[87:51.00]You said you were doing a disappearing act and then you said swinging crowbar.
[87:54.85]Are you doing two acts in one now or?
[88:00.05]The crowbar actually is going to be the one that disappears.
[88:02.57]So, hold our questions.
[88:04.73]Give him a hand.
[88:06.25]Give him a hand.
[88:06.95]We can hold our stupid fucking questions for after the show.
[88:11.07]It's not a stupid question.
[88:12.91]You're a very valued member of the audience.
[88:15.85]So, as we show you here, we're going to spin it around in two circles here.
[88:20.09]Count with me now.
[88:24.01]One.
[88:24.19]No, this is going to be one.
[88:25.94]This is going to be one.
[88:28.04]You have to say it.
[88:28.78]Nobody talk.
[88:29.86]Nobody talk.
[88:30.52]But you can talk when I swing it.
[88:32.43]Okay?
[88:32.85]Oh, okay.
[88:33.93]Okay.
[88:34.39]One... One... Two... I'm not gonna drink, bro!
[88:42.51]It's gone!
[88:45.66]It's gone!
[88:47.38]Where did it go?
[88:49.04]Where'd it go?
[88:51.50]Thank you.
[88:52.28]Thank you.
[88:54.52]Who hired this guy?
[88:55.64]Thank you.
[88:56.59]You know, I searched him up on...
[89:00.60]Fiverr.com.
[89:03.54]They had a couple of Yelp reviews, which is kind of weird.
[89:06.35]You know, the site had other reviews on other sites, but I checked Yelp out and you got at least two and a half stars.
[89:12.65]They said the other two and a half stars disappeared.
[89:15.79]Oh, yeah.
[89:16.63]Actually, five stars.
[89:18.80]But he made the two and a half disappear.
[89:20.56]So I was like, wow, he must be pretty good.
[89:22.90]I do family parties.
[89:24.78]Ben McCall and...
[89:26.83]I do feel like I can only barge as long as there's no children, because I do have a tendency to get upset and swear at things.
[89:32.37]No children, 18 only, no elderly either, I just don't like the way they smell.
[89:39.83]That's fair.
[89:40.53]Who said that?
[89:41.13]Yeah.
[89:42.45]Right here.
[89:43.09]Right here.
[89:43.39]Right here.
[89:45.27]Well, it was me, but... There it is.
[89:46.91]It's fake.
[89:54.21]What about children?
[89:54.89]It's made of plastic.
[89:56.71]I touched it.
[89:59.56]I want to see a show now.
[90:01.16]Oh, okay.
[90:03.56]I mean, you hired me to come here and do a show, but I want to see somebody do some shows.
[90:07.99]Okay, I'll show you something awesome.
[90:09.19]You want to see something awesome?
[90:11.39]Yeah.
[90:11.57]Come on.
[90:11.85]I'll show you.
[90:12.29]I'll show you.
[90:13.65]Okay.
[90:16.39]Uh-oh.
[90:17.33]You stuck to the uh-oh.
[90:20.21]We need to spray something.
[90:22.17]Let's see if that works a little bit.
[90:25.79]A little bit.
[90:26.31]A little.
[90:26.53]There we go.
[90:27.16]Thank you so much.
[90:29.30]Two spots.
[90:30.46]Where can I pick it up?
[90:32.14]Where did you get it?
[90:34.48]Out of me.
[90:35.40]I'm an ink demon.
[90:36.48]I made a drink by myself.
[90:38.06]I thought that was milk.
[90:39.12]I was like, wait a minute.
[90:43.73]That just ripped out a cord.
[90:48.38]Time out!
[90:50.15]Time out!
[90:57.57]Oh, excuse me.
[91:00.05]What are you doing in there?
[91:02.29]Um, he ripped out a cord.
[91:04.10]He ripped out a cord.
[91:05.00]He'll be there in a second.
[91:06.66]It's a weird looking banana.
[91:10.94]What do you mean?
[91:11.86]I need a banana.
[91:15.38]Or is it a coconut?
[91:15.96]Alright, here we go.
[91:17.75]Chiquita banana.
[91:19.89]Oh, sorry, it's a pineapple.
[91:22.17]True.
[91:23.69]That's true.
[91:24.51]My arms are falling asleep.
[91:28.13]Wake him up.
[91:29.83]Where's the red saber?
[91:30.81]Should I have some involvement for him so he feels like he's killing something?
[91:38.96]He seems like, you know, he's like... He's like one of those kids in elementary school that just, like, has to...
[91:45.87]Yeah.
[91:46.17]What?
[91:46.29]Yes.
[91:46.47]Yeah.
[91:46.79]Yeah.
[91:47.05]Yeah.
[91:47.23]Yeah.
[92:16.32]I'm walking in the room.
[92:18.32]Hey, how are you?
[92:18.90]Hey.
[92:19.24]You alright?
[92:20.46]Everything good?
[92:20.88]I don't think so.
[92:21.66]It's fine.
[92:22.14]OK.
[92:22.30]Alright, you ready?
[92:23.82]I'm going to show you something that's going to blow your mind, OK?
[92:30.03]Now, see this?
[92:31.45]What would you call this, huh?
[92:33.51]This right here.
[92:33.87]Yeah, I think that's fine.
[92:45.45]The thing you do when you walk down, um, help me out.
[92:52.33]Straight, straight stairs.
[92:56.00]That's what you think they are, but what they are actually, it's a challenge.
[93:01.46]You know why?
[93:03.16]It's because for someone like me, a very handicapable individual, it's very hard to go down stairs sometimes.
[93:10.12]So, so I'm going to show you, alright, I'm going to show you something.
[93:14.48]It's magical.
[93:15.44]Okay?
[93:15.96]You're not going to believe this.
[93:16.97]This is like as seen on TV, but it's as seen in person.
[93:20.81]Alright?
[93:21.45]It's going to blow your mind.
[93:23.01]Well, I'd love to.
[93:23.89]Now, I know you seem to be a man of, like, personal connections.
[93:29.22]You're a visual learner, right?
[93:30.92]You like to make connections.
[93:32.66]You like to connect the dots, huh?
[93:35.16]And what I want you to do, okay, there's two buttons.
[93:38.98]You see them?
[93:40.44]See the buttons?
[93:42.07]No.
[93:44.58]You wink, wink, see the buttons.
[93:49.08]It's magic, you know?
[93:50.98]You see the buttons.
[93:53.18]You see the buttons.
[93:56.14]They are, they're there.
[93:57.38]You just gotta believe, you know, you know, like, okay, okay, okay.
[94:02.13]I got an idea.
[94:03.37]I see them now.
[94:04.95]Okay, just to further solidify this, you've seen Polar Express, right?
[94:11.13]No.
[94:12.75]Oh, well, okay, we're definitely screwed here, okay?
[94:14.99]Yeah, you definitely saw it, okay.
[94:16.11]Another movie, another movie, another movie.
[94:17.81]Yeah, it's all, it's a magic, yeah, okay.
[94:19.83]Anyways.
[94:22.17]Now, there's two buttons.
[94:24.06]Oh, I see.
[94:24.62]One takes me down.
[94:27.64]Okay, one has a down arrow, one has an up arrow.
[94:29.88]Which one is it?
[94:30.74]The donut, donut!
[94:34.74]Those aren't even buttons.
[94:37.12]The buttons are right here!
[94:38.57]Look at the buttons, look at the buttons.
[94:40.01]Hello?
[94:40.97]Oh, okay, never mind, they're right there.
[94:42.03]Those are more like air cans.
[94:44.71]The buttons!
[94:46.47]The buttons now, I guess.
[94:47.77]Uh, so you went with the left one, okay?
[94:50.37]Okay, my left or your left?
[94:52.43]My left or your left?
[94:53.71]Uh, okay, I understand.
[94:55.13]Okay, wait.
[94:56.38]Left.
[94:57.36]Right.
[94:57.60]Okay, L for left.
[94:59.30]Uh, shoot.
[95:02.14]Left.
[95:03.04]Okay.
[95:06.98]Well, this is my left, so...
[95:09.94]What?
[95:10.58]No, that's... Oh, God.
[95:15.24]Can you put this back on?
[95:16.36]Can you see where I'm standing?
[95:18.08]Okay, there we go.
[95:19.80]Oh, oh.
[95:20.76]It's here.
[95:22.74]That doesn't work.
[95:23.32]That's a whole other plane or field.
[95:24.58]That's not going to work out, is it?
[95:26.54]Okay.
[95:27.30]My right and my left.
[95:29.58]No, no.
[95:32.17]Okay.
[95:32.47]So face the wall.
[95:33.49]Face the wall.
[95:34.59]Now, what I want you to do
[95:39.37]Hey, can you do this with your, with their hands?
[95:43.77]I got to the side, I had to jump.
[95:46.36]Yeah, you're doing a little power squat there, okay.
[95:48.22]Okay.
[95:48.62]Now, one of them, one of them is in the shape of the letter L. You see that?
[95:54.36]You see that with my, my hands?
[95:55.60]Yeah, that would be, that would be right.
[95:59.21]Yes, it is right that it is left.
[96:01.11]You know, it's correct as in right, yeah.
[96:03.37]Uh, but, but, but the one that it's L is, is, is the left hand.
[96:07.59]But L goes like this.
[96:11.20]Oh, yeah, it does.
[96:11.88]You're right.
[96:12.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[96:13.43]Like, yeah, there you go.
[96:14.77]See?
[96:14.91]See what I'm saying?
[96:15.93]Visual order.
[96:16.81]Okay.
[96:17.55]Okay.
[96:17.83]Now, when you associate the left, okay, which one is it?
[96:21.07]That one.
[96:21.97]Which one?
[96:22.71]It's this one.
[96:23.77]There you go.
[96:25.23]Wait.
[96:25.79]Pull it again.
[96:26.23]Have a drink.
[96:26.73]Have a cookie.
[96:29.15]A cookie?
[96:29.51]You get it after the presentation.
[96:30.95]Okay, good.
[96:32.82]Thank you.
[96:33.08]Get ready to hit that button.
[96:34.18]Alright.
[96:35.48]Ready?
[96:37.68]I'm ready.
[96:38.30]Get it.
[96:39.47]Hey, make the sound when you hit the button, okay?
[96:41.57]So I know that you hit the button.
[96:43.17]Are you going to be safe?
[96:44.23]Is everything going to be okay?
[96:46.11]Yeah, it's part of the show.
[96:47.69]Don't come over here.
[96:48.53]Oh, you did it!
[96:55.20]What did I do?
[96:57.28]Amazing.
[96:58.14]I did it.
[96:58.56]Amazing.
[96:59.40]Is that crazy?
[97:01.38]What if I hit the one on the right?
[97:05.42]I'm going to press the one on the right now.
[97:11.19]Oh.
[97:14.93]See what you did?
[97:18.07]Can I help you?
[97:19.45]Can I help you?
[97:20.37]Oh, yeah.
[97:24.65]By not hitting the right button.
[97:27.09]Which button makes you get back up?
[97:28.93]Hit it again.
[97:30.23]No.
[97:31.33]I'm not doing it.

[97:45.55]He's really heavy, actually.
[97:46.93]Help me.
[97:47.73]Can you help me pick him up?
[97:50.13]I'm grabbing you by the shoulder.
[97:51.43]I'm lifting you very slowly.
[97:53.49]Give me a hand.
[97:54.39]Okay.
[97:55.24]Give me a hand.
[97:56.64]Okay.
[97:56.82]Okay.

[98:23.45]Okay, alright.
[98:24.85]I'm going to take you down the stairs slowly, okay?
[98:28.23]Just slowly turn around and go down the staircase, okay?
[98:31.63]I don't... I don't want to go down the stairs anymore.
[98:33.19]I'm not touching any more buttons.
[98:34.39]Look, look, I'll... I'll be je... It's fine, it's fine.
[98:37.61]Just get on the staircase, okay?
[98:40.03]The buttons are broken.
[98:42.12]No, no, you gotta come back, Ramps.
[98:44.54]Did he just die?
[98:47.52]He used to be a strong man, but I guess that's over now.
[98:51.91]Thanks, man.
[98:52.81]Did I- I- Oh, no.
[98:56.25]What?
[98:56.69]He's trying to drown himself.
[98:59.03]He does this at least once a week, stuck in his spine.
[99:01.33]I'm sure he's fine.
[99:04.67]Really?
[99:04.81]Okay.
[99:05.45]This is happening.
[99:06.11]Okay, he's fine.

[99:20.37]Oh, oh, right.
[99:21.09]It was like a powerful... It was quite intimidating.
[99:24.19]Actually, I'm glad that, you know, the floor could have been rumbling.
[99:26.65]Should I do it again?
[99:27.85]Paintings would have been knocked down.
[99:29.13]No, no, no.
[99:30.95]That's a bit more approachable, right?
[99:32.63]Okay, alright, okay.
[99:34.35]No, no, no, no, no.
[99:39.77]Hey, uh... Hey, uh... It's like pose halfway through.

[103:13.01]What is this?
[103:13.81]Where am I?
[103:16.13]I don't know.
[103:16.57]What happened?
[103:17.87]You're just at a wall.
[103:20.01]I'm on the piano.
[103:22.05]What do you mean?
[103:22.51]Dude, why do you... You bailed.
[103:24.51]Dude, why'd you bail on me?
[103:26.47]I had to leave.
[103:30.59]I see how it is.
[103:31.51]I get it.
[103:33.33]Oh, boo!
[103:34.03]I'm sorry.
[103:34.73]Okay.
[103:35.70]I understand where we really stand now.
[103:39.00]I need a break.
[103:39.80]Okay, I need, like, a fucking... I need, like, to sit at the wall for a minute and just, like, dig myself in here.
[103:45.02]Okay.
[103:46.24]Would you like a...
[103:49.36]We could try and find a quieter... I had a little break earlier.
[103:56.30]Hello!
[103:58.00]Hey!
[103:58.75]Table service?
[103:59.49]Where's the drinks?
[104:01.53]What, me?
[104:02.51]Table service?

[104:06.09]Oh, break.
[104:07.49]Oh, thank you so much.
[104:08.56]TM88.
[104:12.72]It's a good year.
[104:13.50]It's a pretty good year.
[104:14.22]88's not a bad year.
[104:15.08]I could have gone with, like, a 75 or an 88 or 80, uh... It is an 88.
[104:21.37]Never mind.
[104:22.77]Green flavor.
[104:24.35]I like blue flavor.
[104:26.17]Is there blue flavor?
[104:28.46]I think that might be green flavor.
[104:29.94]I don't know if I was going to guess.
[104:31.30]No, I want... No, I want a blue flavor.
[104:35.00]There you go.
[104:37.10]So, um, how is your ex-virt-virt-virtual... Well, I'm stuck in character.
[104:44.24]I can't get out of character now.
[104:45.59]That's the problem.
[104:47.03]I don't matter what.
[104:48.81]I'm gonna order a pizza later in a few hours and I'm gonna be talking like this, like, hey, it's me, it's me, Blue Man.
[104:54.19]So I'm stuck here.
[104:55.35]So this is what happens.
[104:56.19]You stay in the Matrix for too long.
[104:58.81]You're stuck in there for life.
[105:00.15]That's funny.
[105:01.61]That's funny.
[105:02.43]Because you're Blue Man, you're stuck.
[105:04.92]That's
[105:05.95]That's a good one.
[105:13.90]Perfect.
[105:15.66]No, I need wine.
[105:17.20]I need my wine.
[105:18.70]Oh, no.
[105:21.26]That's okay.
[105:22.23]It happens.
[105:26.01]This is just how it works.
[105:29.47]Super glue.
[105:31.87]Yeah.
[105:32.67]Powerful.
[105:33.23]Powerful grip.
[105:35.33]Right.
[105:36.67]Would you be interested?
[105:37.75]Yeah.
[105:40.45]I'm listening.
[105:42.41]We could find another world where it is, this is what VRChat is.
[105:49.57]We could go shooting.
[105:51.15]We can... Shooting?
[105:54.49]Yes.
[105:56.20]Like cops and robbers.
[105:57.64]Yeah, let's do some cowboy stuff.
[106:01.14]Okay.
[106:01.54]Okay.
[106:05.49]I shall... Oh, my hand.
[106:08.81]Right, I'll get it set up.
[106:12.73]There's also murder.
[106:16.41]It's... It's a big ol', like, big manor, and you gotta find clues, but someone in the house is a murderer, but someone's also a detective, and... Oh, that's fun.
[106:28.40]That's actually pretty fun.
[106:31.02]Yeah, what do you guys wanna do?
[106:34.97]I'm just experiencing- Oh, I think everyone's- It's a- yeah!
[106:40.41]Huh?

[106:43.16]Oh, you!
[106:44.04]We- we could do that!
[106:45.08]Don't wanna- Don't wanna ride an elephant.
[106:47.60]Wait, you can actually ride- Well, the title of the stream, on my end, is- is VR- Uh, yeah.
[106:53.00]Safari.
[106:54.02]Safari.
[106:54.70]We can't- We can't- VRChat Safari.
[106:56.21]We can't go on a safari.
[106:57.95]Okay, I'm gonna find Africa.
[106:59.95]No.
[107:00.89]I'm gonna go find it.
[107:03.31]Wait.
[107:04.99]I'm glad you're the only one that was watching that.
[107:09.07]I wouldn't know, I'm a monkey.
[107:11.17]What is that?
[107:33.22]Oh, I thought you were a gobstopper.
[107:36.62]Oh, you're the little robot.
[107:38.06]Oh, hi.
[107:38.54]You know, I was just reflecting, you know,
[108:01.96]We're in this future, all this exciting technological innovation, yet I can't walk.
[108:10.72]You know?
[108:10.98]It makes you think, where are the priorities at?
[108:14.83]Huh?
[108:15.29]That's pretty fucked up, you're right.
[108:18.45]It's just look at all this technology.
[108:21.15]Here I am, sitting on a wheelchair, can't move my legs.
[108:25.53]I mean, I kind of can't think.
[108:27.19]I kind of wiggle a bit.
[108:28.29]It's kind of cute sometimes.
[108:29.71]It's a good party trick.
[108:31.20]Can you wiggle your legs?
[108:32.84]Probably not.
[108:33.76]No, I can't.
[108:34.56]It's okay.
[108:35.12]You're a one-trick wonder.
[108:36.60]It's fine.
[108:37.68]One day you'll... With those... God.
[108:41.72]Pepperoni nipples?
[108:43.27]What?
[108:44.47]Hey!
[108:44.97]Hey!
[108:45.43]Hey!
[108:46.07]Hey!
[108:46.57]Sorry, I was admiring someone else's nipples.
[108:48.43]Sorry, what?
[108:49.99]Um... Yours are great, too.
[108:51.95]Oh, God.
[108:52.51]We're going on safari.
[108:55.03]Oh.
[108:56.07]Wait.
[108:58.25]Okay.
[108:58.81]Listen, buddy.
[109:00.73]Uh...
[109:01.92]really nervous about safaris and stuff.
[109:04.38]If there's any rides and things, I might need your glue and maybe emotional support, okay?
[109:11.73]I may bring off a tough, alpha-like exterior, you know, hoo-ah!
[109:17.51]I've broken down physically and emotionally lately, and it's been rough, you know?
[109:22.35]Yeah, punch me in the face as hard as you can.
[109:23.55]Let me just see.
[109:24.21]I'll be the judge of that.
[109:25.59]The bus is leaving!
[109:26.21]Do what?
[109:26.67]Oh, the bus is leaving!
[109:28.85]Come on!
[109:29.61]We'll continue this or whatever, yeah.
[109:32.20]I think the bus is already gone.
[109:34.34]Is it?
[109:34.88]Oh, no.
[109:35.18]Oh, it's the bus.
[109:36.18]No, no!
[109:38.83]Oh!
[109:40.09]Oh!
[109:41.25]Oh.
[109:43.37]Okay.
[109:43.89]We missed the bus.
[109:44.55]It's time to calm down.
[109:46.91]Kiwo's going to be so mad at us.
[109:48.71]Oh, my God.
[109:49.29]No, no, no, no, no.
[109:50.07]Let's go on the computer here.
[109:51.37]Look, we can get on from here.
[109:52.37]Okay, so what you want to do with the computer, alright?
[109:54.96]Check the schedule.
[109:55.62]Oh, God.
[109:56.48]Is open your menu in the computer.
[109:59.34]Oh, my God.
[110:00.26]She's going to be so mad.
[110:02.20]Whoa, whoa.
[110:02.86]What are all these tabs up here?
[110:04.50]Dude, Q's computer is so mad at us.
[110:06.46]We missed the bus.
[110:07.88]I think it's him.
[110:09.56]435 horn hub tabs?
[110:10.62]How do you even have the time to do that?
[110:14.62]Okay, come on.
[110:15.26]There's something else.
[110:16.76]Alright, there's a little bridge just there.
[110:19.43]I needed the bus schedule.
[110:21.11]What are you looking up?
[110:23.67]Who even has that much time?
[110:25.91]I've got to get out of here.
[110:31.59]We missed the bus schedule.
[110:32.75]We have to wait for the bus to come back.
[110:35.94]Well, do we wait or do we request off?
[110:38.74]I guess Ty's figuring it out.
[110:40.58]I'm fine.
[110:41.62]I'm just going to sit here.
[110:43.24]We missed the rapture.
[110:44.56]Are you sure about that?
[110:46.88]Missed the rapture.
[110:48.78]Who is everybody here?
[110:49.92]My name's Ace.
[110:51.36]What's going on?
[110:52.06]Hi, Ace.
[110:52.80]This is Ty.
[110:53.76]This is Glue Man.
[110:55.14]This is...
[110:57.94]Extra-extraterrestrial creature.
[110:59.98]Stitch it.
[111:00.70]Okay.
[111:01.20]That's fucking close enough.
[111:05.05]I can't see a thing.
[111:05.97]Thanks.
[111:07.27]Wow, your figures make really weird noises when you're doing that butterfly shape with them.
[111:11.45]So, uh, what's your, uh, explain your workout regimen to me.
[111:14.95]Workout regimen?
[111:15.83]Explain your, uh, workout regimen.
[111:18.83]Yeah.
[111:19.12]Uh, specifically your upper body regimen?
[111:21.64]Because, you know, I can't really work out my lower extremities so, uh... It's really easy.
[111:25.60]So...
[111:26.66]That's what I got here.
[111:27.68]Seated, right?
[111:28.56]Sit down.
[111:30.00]Yeah, you sit down.
[111:31.18]I mean, I'm already doing that, so I'm already stepping out.
[111:33.50]Okay, what's next?
[111:35.00]Here's a keyboard, and then here's the mouse, right?
[111:39.07]You should have given me that.
[111:41.61]Right hand, left hand.
[111:43.45]Which hand is the mouse?
[111:45.13]The mouse is on your right hand.
[111:46.62]I didn't know.
[111:48.22]And then you open up a certain website for athletics.
[111:51.48]It's reddit.com.
[111:53.18]There's a computer right there.
[111:56.90]I'll go to that.
[111:57.58]Is that okay?
[111:58.04]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[111:58.88]I'll continue my pantos.
[112:00.00]I'll pantomime with this.
[112:02.92]You can pretend.
[112:03.65]Can you just squat over there?
[112:04.91]Because I don't know if I'll be able to hear you.
[112:06.77]I'm not comfortable on this computer.
[112:08.69]I can't take you with me.
[112:11.03]Can I get my seat cleaner and wipe all the fucking bullshit?
[112:16.49]Gamer gunk.
[112:20.63]Okay, so we'll sit down here.
[112:23.45]I mean, this computer is just one big trackpad.
[112:25.51]I don't even see the keys, you know?
[112:27.37]Yeah, I mean, these computers suck.
[112:29.27]Holograms.
[112:30.23]Holograms.
[112:31.17]It could be touchscreen.
[112:32.29]It might be touchscreen.
[112:33.23]Admire your son over here, you know?
[112:34.89]Ah, that's my son.
[112:35.63]There he is.
[112:37.41]Ah, beautiful.
[112:37.87]Oh, really?
[112:38.27]Lean back.
[112:39.31]That'll get some views.
[112:40.13]Yeah.
[112:41.01]Okay.
[112:42.25]And then usually what I like to do is I like to hover over, you know, the front page, you know, all of the top of the front page.
[112:51.14]Click, right?
[112:51.54]Oh, there's the son again.
[112:53.73]Scroll down a little.
[112:56.23]See?
[112:57.61]Get motivated?
[112:58.32]Yeah, there's somebody's dog running around.
[113:00.12]They have like a toy in their mouth.
[113:01.30]That's pretty cool.
[113:02.08]Oh, eye bleach.
[113:03.06]That's beautiful.
[113:05.54]Oh, God.
[113:06.18]What the?
[113:07.20]Oh.
[113:08.41]Why is that on the front page?
[113:09.71]What?
[113:10.15]What?
[113:10.47]What?
[113:10.71]Oh, God.
[113:13.05]I scrolled right by it.
[113:13.89]I scrolled right by it.
[113:14.81]Oh, my God.
[113:15.13]What is it?
[113:18.94]What?
[113:19.22]I just figured you never wanted to freak out!
[113:21.32]It's not the picture of my sister for!
[113:23.86]Guys, it's okay.
[113:24.52]It's a picture of a black car.
[113:26.02]It's not my computer.
[113:27.54]It's not my computer, okay?
[113:29.77]It's fine.
[113:31.81]How do you organize your sister's own... Okay, anyways, just keep scrolling.
[113:36.53]Scroll through, you click on... And what I like to do to make you... I'll go to where, you know... First is, ah, Sekiro needs an easy mode.
[113:44.78]And what you do is you click on that.
[113:46.46]And you sit back here, and you fucking... I can't agree so much with this guy.
[113:50.68]And you argue.
[113:51.68]You argue for about ten paragraphs.
[113:54.84]And then you hit the enter button, and it's like, fuck you.
[113:57.30]You've got to do that, too.
[113:58.66]You've got to swear.
[114:00.52]Okay.
[114:00.64]And that goes through.
[114:01.60]Wait, wait.
[114:02.96]Do you enter the fuck you, or do you say that as you hit the enter?
[114:05.97]No, no, no.
[114:06.43]Is that part of the ten paragraphs?
[114:08.07]No, no, no.
[114:08.75]You just simply say that out loud here.
[114:12.28]You don't want to come across as an asshole.
[114:14.34]This guy does lessons, you know, but... Yeah, you're just giving an objective or subjective... It's objective, right?
[114:20.03]Objective article.
[114:21.99]We're just talking here.
[114:23.39]Okay, I see that.
[114:24.73]And you do that another 60 to 75 more times.
[114:29.94]And then you close the lid.
[114:32.40]You get up.
[114:33.60]And you go take a shower.
[114:36.74]And you're done.
[114:37.50]That's all it takes.
[114:38.73]How much muscle mass do we gain from doing this?
[114:41.29]Like, I'm talking in a year's time?
[114:43.17]You won't understand.
[114:44.29]I've got fucking 60,000 karma, okay?
[114:46.69]I've been doing this for a long time.
[114:49.44]Wow.
[114:49.92]See the karma here?
[114:53.00]Yeah, okay, but you may have 60,000 karma, but how much platinum are we talking about?
[114:57.34]Gold, silver?
[114:59.50]How much you got in that?
[115:02.24]I've been giving it a few times.
[115:04.11]I've been giving it, like, twice.
[115:05.89]Somebody gave me gold once.
[115:07.07]Oh.
[115:08.50]I showed a picture of my Nintendo Switch, and I got gold for it.
[115:14.25]Not that far, not that far.
[115:18.19]So, what would be plat level?
[115:21.61]Would it be 12 paragraphs, or...
[115:24.66]I think at that point you would have two computers.
[115:29.78]One laptop and one desktop.
[115:42.67]You can go right here.
[115:43.31]What's going on here?
[115:43.99]Are you just, wait, are you petting your bird while you do that?
[115:47.06]No, these are two computers.
[115:48.30]You can go in here on this keyboard and one on the other.
[115:50.60]No, but the noises you were making, was that your pet bird?
[115:53.80]Those are computer noises.
[115:54.92]Do you make that sound?
[115:55.70]Those are computer noises.
[115:57.94]Usually, so my keys usually sound like a little boop, boop, ba-doop, boop, boop, you know?
[116:05.20]Boop, boop, ba-doop, boop, boop, boop, ba-doop, boop, boop.
[116:08.10]You know what I'm saying?
[116:09.28]How is mine so wrong?
[116:11.18]What kind of model are you rocking?
[116:13.02]No, it goes... No, that's not right.
[116:14.10]It goes... That's how it goes.
[116:14.86]What?
[116:15.08]Okay.
[116:34.25]We're just gonna wait for the bus right here.
[116:36.01]Oh, excuse me.
[116:36.61]Don't stand in front.
[116:37.51]Okay.
[116:37.73]Yeah, there's the bus
[117:07.48]I'm just going to type on Reddit.
[117:10.66]Where?
[117:10.90]Oh, what?
[117:11.52]What's going on?
[117:15.82]Turn my mic up a bit.
[117:16.98]Is it low?
[117:17.76]It shouldn't be that low.
[117:21.32]Hmm.
[117:37.14]I'll do this.
[117:38.14]This will probably help.
[117:43.29]They're probably a little high.
[117:47.31]We'll try that.
[118:02.26]So what is all this?
[118:07.17]This is a place where you can dance.
[118:09.81]And it makes your character dance.
[118:11.77]Wait, why are we here?
[118:13.09]What is this?
[118:14.69]What?
[118:16.02]Do you want to see?
[118:18.32]This is what I've been looking like this whole time.
[118:20.18]Wow, I forgot.
[118:21.92]Sometimes I forget.
[118:22.86]That's right.
[118:29.65]Look at, oh, fuck, look at all that.
[118:35.32]He looks so sad.
[118:36.50]I could just do this for like 45 minutes straight.
[118:41.86]Ah, no I couldn't, I'm gonna hit stuff.
[119:03.50]Hold on, check this out.
[119:09.11]Should we, uh... Do you think we should invite people or just... I just want to go pee.
[119:20.19]I haven't gone pee in, like, all day.
[119:24.47]Darn, you pick one.
[119:33.67]Don't wait, are you gonna play songs?
[119:42.24]Down arrow.
[119:49.38]I guess we're doing this now.
[119:50.86]Step on the button.
[119:54.89]Step on a button?
[119:57.75]Go in the green circle.
[119:58.83]Okay.
[119:59.15]Step a little bit closer, there you go.
[120:02.13]Here we go.
[120:03.09]What is this?
[120:05.37]We're gonna dance.
[120:08.81]Oh, guys, we're actually controlling the characters, okay.
[120:12.03]Yeah.
[120:13.05]We're doing a really good dance.
[120:15.71]Man.
[120:16.93]It's like we practiced.
[120:19.28]Yeah, you guys, we did this off stream for a little while.
[120:21.14]It's been months.
[120:23.78]We finally get to do this.
[120:25.44]Oh, my gosh, you guys are so fluent today.
[120:27.80]I'm loving it.
[120:28.90]Your ankles are really loose today.
[120:30.72]This is seriously like...
[120:32.89]75 fucking hours of work.
[120:36.21]Oh, yeah, dude.
[120:38.77]This has been worth it.
[120:41.13]Months, man.
[120:41.97]Months.
[120:42.77]You know, I didn't really agree with the sod choice at first, but, you know, Jerma really sold for it, you know?
[120:48.99]Yeah, yeah.
[120:51.39]I figured people would like it.
[120:54.05]I said, okay, you know, that's fair.
[120:56.73]If this is what you listen to, we'll do it for you.
[120:59.83]Yep, yep.
[121:03.83]Alright, what did I just walk into?
[121:13.53]Get out of here!
[121:15.51]We're practicing!
[121:16.47]Yeah, don't mind, don't mind.
[121:18.59]What?
[121:19.01]I'm under like a fucking magic spell.
[121:21.07]This can't be stopped.
[121:22.91]Hey, Stetchan, you gonna get a request from Woops?
[121:25.53]Oh no, it's not over!
[121:26.69]We're just starting!
[121:27.47]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I did it.
[121:29.65]Okay, I forgot this part of the song.
[121:31.55]I forgot.
[121:32.07]Can I come out and like punch myself in the face?
[121:35.33]This is the part I'm worst at.
[121:37.03]How do I like, how do I like rake my own neck here?
[121:40.03]Carry through, carry through.
[121:41.05]It's all about the end, please.
[121:44.33]What is happening?
[121:46.03]Oh, there you go.
[121:46.65]Yeah, show what you got.
[121:48.15]You can tell this group hasn't been together too long.
[121:51.21]They're kind of a mess out there today.
[121:54.08]What are you saying?
[121:54.78]No, no, no.
[121:55.38]Excuse me.
[121:55.94]Yeah, we're performing.
[121:58.65]Burn is trying to pull everything together, but no one seems to be listening.
[122:01.91]Why is it still going?
[122:03.15]No, no, no.
[122:04.57]It's so long.
[122:05.77]Well, if you want to quit, just press your menu button thing again and go to Respawn.
[122:09.99]Same place you get the backflip.
[122:13.15]There you go.
[122:15.08]Uh, Cake Ben?
[122:15.62]Does anyone want to press reset down here?
[122:28.58]I still got it, baby.
[122:32.43]You know, there's something about this song, you know, it just really, really gives you a... God has abandoned us, yeah.
[122:46.25]God has abandoned us.
[122:49.50]There used to be, like, a... He's right there.
[122:50.94]He's in the tuxedo.
[122:52.38]...stick in here.
[122:57.96]We've been in this vlog.
[122:59.78]This is fucking wild.
[123:03.08]Oh my goodness.
[123:04.92]I'm gonna go take a little bit of a break.
[123:08.71]Alright.
[123:09.57]You got a nice chill place where there's not a lot going on?
[123:12.91]No, I'll just take the headset off and give myself some view.

[127:46.78]Hello.
[127:50.50]So.
[127:50.70]That was an adventure.
[128:06.59]This is less chaos than I expected.
[128:16.45]Kiwo isn't feeling good, so she's taking a break.
[128:18.29]Oh, that's too bad.
[128:21.55]Well, Kiwo, it was really, really fun and funny.

[130:07.28]Where's Josh?
[130:08.20]Josh, you're here.
[130:23.07]No, I'm not muted.
[130:32.83]Why is the closet cracked open?
[130:33.99]That's a good question.
[130:34.97]Shouldn't be.
[130:40.36]Let me... Kim check.
[130:54.48]What?
[130:57.27]How?
[130:58.95]How would you even get in there?
[131:01.40]overwhelming oh yeah it's it's it's a lot to take in what the fuck alright I'm gonna let's get back in let me get a sip of my coffee
[131:35.79]You guys having a good time?
[131:36.91]Is it fun?
[131:38.05]Is it fun to watch?
[131:38.65]Because you know that's important, right?
[131:46.00]No.
[131:47.52]No.
[131:48.52]No.
[131:52.84]Let me get this out of my ear.
[131:58.70]Are there other people that are here streaming too?
[132:01.06]Probably.
[132:01.70]I think at least a couple of them are.
[132:08.19]At least a couple.
[132:09.82]I would assume.
[132:10.38]Alright, let's get in here.
[132:18.64]Gotta clean this for a second.
[132:19.78]Hold on, it's kind of greasy.
[132:24.06]Increase my mic.
[132:27.54]I don't know what's going on there.
[132:30.86]It's weird.
[132:34.43]Shouldn't be doing that.
[132:43.75]How's that?
[132:44.79]Is that better?
[132:50.48]Increase my mic in the game?
[132:58.48]Faced away a lot of the time.
[132:59.46]Yeah, that's true.
[133:02.42]Uh, hold on.
[133:02.80]Let me...
[133:11.77]I think there's a way I can actually increase it in-game, but... Someone called me a cave goblin.
[133:22.25]You're not far off, you really aren't.
[133:26.05]Yeah, the in-game mic is the headset.
[133:28.95]I made sure to set that first.
[133:32.52]So, you guys are hearing my mic.
[133:35.18]Everyone's hearing the Vive...
[133:41.49]Okay.
[133:43.09]Let's get back in here and see what we're going to do next.
[133:45.89]Because that murder mystery mansion thing sounds actually kind of fun.
[133:48.51]I feel like there could be some fun there.
[133:56.18]Instead of anime dancing.
[134:00.40]Not that I'm just saying.
[134:01.16]Kim's not in there.
[134:11.58]Did I just spit in this?
[134:12.48]How did I spit in here?
[134:15.57]That doesn't make any sense.
[134:16.35]I spit in here.
[134:22.97]Alright.
[134:27.98]There's a gnome.
[134:30.54]Oh, there's Josh.
[134:31.16]Okay.
[134:31.56]Alright.
[134:32.00]Let's get back in.
[134:32.62]See you all in VR.
[134:40.58]One more sip of coffee and we'll get out of here, you know?
[134:42.64]Do more!
[134:43.20]No more!
[134:43.46]I'm still having a decent time.
[135:07.46]I mean, we're playing with Kiwo and VRJosh, so I'm not just going to disappear and be like, bye, I'm doing something else.
[135:14.47]So we're kind of all doing this together, so.
[135:19.37]So let's go track them down.
[135:20.92]What happened here?
[135:26.86]I'm excited to see that
[135:55.93]Hey, we both came back at the exact same time.
[135:59.68]What's the matter?
[136:01.48]Oh, the gnome.
[136:01.92]What the fuck just happened to me?
[136:03.20]How did you do that?
[136:05.30]You just grabbed me and pulled me into you.
[136:08.38]Why can you do that?
[136:11.32]You just get...
[136:32.34]That was pretty awesome.
[136:34.12]I got- No!
[136:34.54]No!
[136:36.28]Why am I stuck?
[136:37.00]Oh god, he's paralyzing me.
[136:38.28]What are you guys talking about?
[136:39.26]Alright.
[136:42.87]Uh, okay, maybe we're just crazy.
[136:44.37]So what's the plan?
[136:45.61]What do we want to do?
[136:46.39]What do you guys want to do?
[136:47.67]Where's, uh, Whiskey Book?
[136:48.49]You over here?
[136:49.43]True bubblegum.
[136:50.27]What are you feeling?
[136:51.07]I think she went outside.
[136:52.32]Did she go out?
[136:53.60]Hello.
[136:54.26]Hello.
[136:54.92]Hello.
[136:55.06]Hello.
[136:55.52]Yeah, you can go talk to her out there.
[136:57.48]Out here?
[136:59.64]It's like when you have loads of YouTube videos open, and then your Chrome crashes, and you accidentally restore all tabs, and then just everything at once.
[137:24.70]It's, um...
[137:28.88]It all refreshes.
[137:31.10]And stuff starts playing that you don't even know.
[137:33.66]You're like, when did I click that?
[137:35.88]When did I click on Beyonce's Single Ladies?
[137:38.06]I don't remember that happening.
[137:39.26]And it just loads, too.
[137:42.66]I have a world.
[137:46.26]I don't know if it still exists, but if it does, and I hope it does, I have a very special world.
[137:54.02]Oh, God.
[137:54.54]I'm looking forward to it, whatever it is.
[138:01.39]I hope it still exists.
[138:04.43]Yes!
[138:05.45]Oh, it doesn't.
[138:05.99]I don't know if it's working.
[138:08.39]It just exists.
[138:10.41]It's called Jerma.
[138:12.39]Jerma 2907?
[138:13.21]Why is it 2... What is Jerma 2907?
[138:28.64]I don't know if it still works.
[138:32.55]Oh, no.
[138:34.05]The picture doesn't work.
[138:34.99]What?
[138:35.17]Is this the green screen stream?

[140:16.36]He just breathed in my face.
[140:17.54]This is so awkward.
[140:24.19]If you would just come to this world and not know what this was, you'd be like, what?
[140:27.05]Yeah, yeah.
[140:29.13]Alright, whatever.

[145:20.92]Mm-hmm.
[145:21.86]A warm fleece.
[145:22.98]Yeah, no, it makes sense.
[145:24.16]You know, not in the warmer months.
[145:25.99]It doesn't really make much sense.
[145:28.23]Nah, I wear it a lot.

[146:29.48]He's broken.
[146:30.06]He's blinking at me.
[146:33.00]It's so fragile, but so expensive.
[146:35.19]There are people that pay like $600 just so they could experience this.
[146:47.00]Wait, what?
[146:48.18]Oh, Vibe?
[146:48.80]I thought you were talking about this.
[146:50.44]I was like, what?
[146:51.62]Somebody charges $600 for this?
[146:53.76]And it's like it's for free on YouTube.
[147:00.19]You know, it's crazy.
[147:00.89]So many people charge like $600 for this room.
[147:03.81]And then they fill it and they watch this.
[147:06.59]That's so funny.
[147:08.49]Oh, my God.
[147:12.01]Oh yeah, VRChat is free to download and you can all visit the Jerma world.
[147:17.33]You don't want to see just a bunch of anime girls sat here watching.
[147:20.69]It's all huddled around.
[147:23.79]I don't even know where I was even going with this one.
[147:31.12]You see, I have a sheet.
[147:32.54]I still have it.
[147:35.04]We were taking requests.
[147:37.27]And what I'm looking at, I have like a sheet that has hundreds of things listed on it.
[147:42.25]And I keep walking over and going like, what the hell are we doing now?
[147:45.63]What's the next one?
[147:50.13]I should have used that cold one for Skyrim.
[147:52.85]Fuck.
[147:58.89]So how do we say, hey, where's the invite?
[148:04.59]Um, there should be like a little thing saying...
[148:07.23]No, I don't have anything.
[148:09.47]Can I invest in you?
[148:12.51]I'll make the world.
[148:16.03]I can do this.
[148:17.41]I'm capable.
[148:18.97]Do it.
[148:19.23]Thank you.
[148:23.44]Oh, fuck.
[148:29.62]Come on.
[148:32.38]I want to fight you.
[148:34.60]I'll be fighting you.
[148:35.20]That's what's happening here.
[148:39.24]Oh, shut up!
[148:44.34]That was embarrassing.
[148:46.07]You're like, that guy knock you out?
[148:48.11]Get in there.
[148:49.45]Knock him down.
[148:54.51]Oh, my wrist!
[148:56.71]Oh!
[149:07.00]I don't know, how are you?
[149:08.70]Hey, I got an invite!
[149:09.34]Wait.
[149:11.50]I don't think I have an invite now.
[149:13.64]It's like just shoving us all in the same room.
[149:15.76]What was that?
[149:20.73]What just fell off the table?
[149:40.90]Those are friend requests.
[149:42.22]He's gonna kick you if you're not careful.
[150:09.72]These are pretty good.
[150:10.60]I'm going to give myself a little credit here.
[150:13.48]The kick?
[150:15.06]That one, not so much, but... Fuck you!
[150:22.24]I keep getting friend invites, but not... Yeah, that's fine.
[150:27.35]Oh, go through here?
[150:29.85]Yep.
[150:45.88]So that's the riff.
[150:46.62]Oh, cool.
[150:52.02]Oh, okay.
[151:11.38]Everyone stands in a circle.
[151:12.48]Masked player presses start.
[151:13.91]You begin.
[151:14.53]Bystander.
[151:16.09]Find knives and stab everybody.
[151:18.01]Only you can use knives.
[151:19.23]Don't get shot.
[151:20.21]You cannot pick up the gun.
[151:21.65]Okay.
[151:23.05]You start with the gun.
[151:24.03]Shoot the murderer.
[151:24.68]Shooting bystanders drops the gun.
[151:26.36]You can shoot through walls.
[151:30.88]Identify the murderer.
[151:33.42]So there's five clues.
[151:34.48]Okay.
[151:37.73]So, lockable doors, throwable knife, 150 plus clue locations.
[151:41.91]What about this, guys?
[151:43.29]I've had bad experiences in creepy mansions before.
[151:45.85]Okay.
[151:47.42]Yeah, you got experience here.
[151:50.18]Yeah.
[151:50.74]I'm... Is it 12?
[151:55.38]Did I do it?
[151:57.02]We have the perfect division.
[151:58.38]I got whoops wrong there.
[151:59.56]Yep.
[152:00.46]Fucking... What happened to me?
[152:02.84]Oh.
[152:03.56]And I'm not a whooper anymore.
[152:06.08]Just back in the corner, Tommy.
[152:08.51]I didn't puke on anyone.
[152:11.35]I think he's getting spammed with friend requests.
[152:14.25]Yeah, probably.
[152:15.59]I'm just trying to see if I want to be Glue Man still if I want to change.
[152:21.71]Did you favorite him?
[152:24.21]No, I don't think so.
[152:26.01]I just cloned him because I'm a moron.
[152:29.59]I think you could favorite clone avatars, right?
[152:32.04]In avatar, underneath yourself, you can...
[152:37.26]Oh, okay, that's cool.
[152:38.46]So that way it's always at your disposal.
[152:40.44]Oh, alright.
[152:41.70]I think you can.
[152:42.44]If you can clone them, you can probably favorite them.
[152:45.10]Yeah, I think I can.
[152:46.64]And he could probably help you out to get some more.
[152:48.33]Mac went idle.
[152:50.73]Mac was not moving around when allowed.
[152:54.05]Oh, yeah.
[152:55.85]It's loading.
[152:56.73]I just don't see it.
[152:57.99]Don't see either of you two.
[152:59.86]There I am.
[153:00.84]Hey, look.
[153:02.74]Is that Handsome Jack?
[153:03.82]Oh, he's just gone.
[153:05.09]No, my Handsome Jack broke.
[153:07.05]It's Reece from Tales from the Borderlands.
[153:10.58]Ah, okay, cool.
[153:12.80]I like this guy.
[153:15.40]Oh.
[153:15.62]Hey, look at Kiwo.
[153:20.38]Don't change out that avatar just yet.
[153:22.20]I'm just a loading nightmare for all these people.
[153:27.60]Oh, wait, what?
[153:30.38]Where's, where's, where's, where's, where's?
[153:32.26]All I see are blue ghosts.
[153:34.86]Oh, man, you put on a little bit of weight there, buddy.
[153:38.80]Guess those 10 paragraphs on Reddit weren't doing enough for you.
[153:44.36]Oh, yeah, you're going to need to make sure you're standing in a circle.
[153:49.61]Who am I?
[153:50.01]Oh.
[153:50.17]It's still... Wait.
[153:51.83]You're missing one.
[153:53.11]Ty!
[153:53.25]Ty!
[154:02.61]With shoes on, okay?
[154:04.37]I swear, I'm just a monkey.
[154:06.81]Oh wait, Ty's still here.
[154:08.73]Yeah, it's like that shaggy song.
[154:13.51]Wasn't me.
[154:14.01]That's fine.
[154:15.15]What was I hearing?
[154:17.89]I heard a gun.
[154:19.55]Yeah, Ty's right there.
[154:23.08]Yeah, Kiwo, can you hit the reset button?
[154:25.36]I guess they call it Transformation Tuesday for a reason, huh?
[154:28.00]Wait one moment, he's chiseled.
[154:30.48]What do I look like?
[154:31.94]Oh, no one's in the circle.
[154:36.87]Everyone in the circle.
[154:38.23]Where's Ace-J?
[154:40.21]I have, like, socks on.
[154:41.65]So, the time is going to round.
[154:45.11]Give us, like, an eight-second TL;DR.
[154:52.57]Okay, now if it kills people, if it shoots people, bad guys.
[154:55.92]We gotta find... I'm the murderer.
[155:04.92]I think you are the... I'm not the murderer, I'm just a monkey.
[155:11.70]Who even owns this place?
[155:13.40]I think you're the gunman.
[155:15.37]Who even owns... I guess the gunman would have a gun.
[155:18.98]Ace J owns this place, but he's not here right now, so we're gonna make a mess.
[155:22.32]Somebody just shot a gun.
[155:23.14]He invited us to his private party.
[155:24.86]Oh, someone's shooting a gun right now.
[155:26.72]This is after we crashed into the party.
[155:28.01]He just left us in his... He left us in his... He left us in his... He left us in his... He left us in his... He left us in his... He left us in his... Ace J invited us to his party, but he's missing.
[155:37.49]Was he murdered?
[155:39.34]They're not at you, you're scattered like bloody ranches!
[155:44.64]Fucking hell!
[155:47.54]It's like Scooby-Doo, you're meant to work as a team, everyone knows that if you split up, then someone's gonna die!
[155:53.16]Are you out of your mind?
[155:57.10]I don't know who went there, I don't know who went there, we're all together.
[156:00.66]How do you open doors?
[156:02.10]Obviously the murderer!
[156:03.84]Let's go in and see if anyone's died over there, if I scream you'll know.
[156:09.09]Wait, what?
[156:09.63]Have I got a... Have I got a gun in my hand?
[156:14.01]You have a gun in your hand?
[156:17.00]It's Kickman!
[156:18.24]It's Kickman!
[156:18.92]It's Kickman!
[156:19.44]Let me in!
[156:20.36]Let me in!
[156:22.40]Good idea, Vern.
[156:23.98]Good idea.
[156:25.10]Why is it not working?
[156:26.20]Can't we just have dinner like a real family?
[156:29.88]Apparently not.
[156:30.59]Apparently they just want to show us up.
[156:34.33]You know what?
[156:35.35]A lot of them, they can bugger off and go to bed without supper.
[156:38.62]Yes.
[156:39.16]I made some Easy Mac.
[156:42.58]I made some Easy Mac.
[156:43.82]We can eat it right there real quick.
[156:45.70]If you want.
[156:46.14]I made some Easy Mac for us.
[156:49.32]Don't eat Easy Mac.
[156:50.41]Easy Mac has caking powder agents.
[156:53.33]I can't go out there because it's not wheelchair accessible, is it?
[156:56.95]There's not a gun here.
[157:00.39]I have a gun?
[157:01.21]An invisible one in my hand?
[157:02.99]The hell?
[157:03.43]It's broken.
[157:04.61]There's no gun in this lobby and we can't grab things.
[157:07.56]It's broken.
[157:08.28]Oh, shit.
[157:09.14]The lobby broke.
[157:10.48]And is Cake back?
[157:11.74]Where's Cake been?
[157:14.04]I have the fake gun.
[157:17.10]Is somebody in here?
[157:23.65]Hello?
[157:27.21]There's a knife here.
[157:30.44]and then you can find clues along the way.
[157:32.36]We're all going to die.
[157:34.70]We're dead.
[157:35.18]We're dead.
[157:36.94]We'll go through in here.
[157:38.72]I'm trying to open the doors.
[157:40.36]Yeah, it's broken.
[157:41.92]Oh, the game is broken.
[157:43.40]Fucking Christ, that was harrowing.
[157:44.96]I didn't like that.
[157:47.32]Okay, let's like... We need to drop a portal to a new instance.
[157:51.31]This lobby is broken.
[157:53.31]Video games.
[157:54.53]I love video games.
[157:56.81]Let's drop a portal in this hallway over here.
[157:59.71]Is that a Warframe painting?
[158:02.43]I think IQ disconnected.
[158:07.61]I think what happened is IQ was the... The detective had disconnected in the middle of the... That's what I was thinking.
[158:18.23]Somebody must have disconnected.
[158:19.45]Hi there, buddy.
[158:20.69]I'm gonna be Joe.
[158:21.23]What?
[158:21.55]I'm gonna be Joe.
[158:30.64]You're going to be Joe?
[158:31.68]Yeah.
[158:35.12]The everyday Joe.
[158:36.92]It's me, Joe.
[158:39.46]I don't see Joe yet, but.
[158:41.82]Yeah, you will in a few minutes.
[158:42.83]He'll be here in a second for you.
[158:46.71]Is that eyeliner?
[158:48.73]Ah, that's not a problem, man.
[158:49.75]I don't know.
[158:50.45]Who cares, right?
[158:53.53]He doesn't like eyeliner.
[158:55.77]He's got eyeliner anyway.
[158:57.27]It's cool.
[158:58.11]It makes my eyes pop out a little bit.
[158:59.81]You know, it's not a big deal.
[159:01.64]I mean, that's why I put it on.
[159:04.70]I know it looks good.
[159:05.90]That's why I do it.
[159:08.54]Hmm.
[159:11.40]Alright.
[159:14.10]Thanks, Hectorista, as well.
[159:17.46]Should we just do rounds while, like, Earth, or they, like, is loading messed up?
[159:22.52]Uh, yeah, I mean, uh, yeah, I think, whatever.
[159:28.76]Uh, yeah, the guy with the knife, don't get stabbed by the knife and watch out for the gun, something like that, whatever.
[159:36.17]Oh my god, I just saw someone join the moment the match started.
[159:39.87]I just saw someone's blue avatar.
[159:42.37]Did someone spawn with the gun this time?
[159:44.61]Let's check that.
[159:45.71]Whoa, okay.
[159:46.99]Anybody got a gun?
[159:47.79]Who's got the gun?
[159:48.67]Somebody's up there.
[159:49.53]They just instantly, just instantly, they scatter.
[159:52.82]That people running around all over the fucking place, I don't know, it's like, it's fucked up.
[159:56.34]I agree.
[159:56.78]It's more exciting, man.
[159:58.86]It's Detective Tyranus.
[160:00.70]So we got a gun, that's good.
[160:03.14]Welcome to the party.
[160:05.22]I don't trust anybody as far as I can throw them in here, okay?
[160:07.54]So let's just be completely honest.
[160:10.60]I think we gotta nominate a leader.
[160:13.29]I don't trust that guy.
[160:14.89]I don't trust him.
[160:16.57]Did you just shoot him?
[160:27.01]Why did you shoot that guy?
[160:29.87]I'm the detective now, okay?
[160:31.37]Wait, no.
[160:32.48]The last time you had a gun in your hand, things went bad.
[160:35.34]Yeah, Kilo shot you somehow.
[160:38.28]What are you talking about?
[160:39.38]That never happened.
[160:40.22]I don't know what you're talking about at all.
[160:44.33]What?
[160:44.71]Can you fetch me some Windex in the closet?
[160:47.49]I'm not going anywhere by myself, okay?
[160:50.47]I'm taking everybody if I'm going to go somewhere.
[160:53.03]We're out of Windex.
[160:54.11]If you're not in line of sight, you're dead.
[160:57.25]Yeah.
[160:58.52]What about all-purpose, like an all-surface cleaner?
[161:03.48]I'm going to go.
[161:05.44]There's a knife in there.
[161:07.50]There's a knife in there.
[161:09.82]Knife in that room?
[161:11.28]I'm watching you.
[161:12.52]What about wood?
[161:13.16]Sorry.
[161:14.11]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[161:14.97]Hey, hey, hey.
[161:15.33]Hey, I'm watching you.
[161:16.38]Just want to make sure you know.
[161:17.82]Hey, buddy.
[161:18.78]I'm watching you.
[161:19.38]Just want to make sure you know I'm fucking watching you.
[161:30.38]Hey, hey, hey, how are you?
[161:58.41]I'm just taking a look.
[161:59.01]Not good.
[161:59.51]I don't like it.
[162:00.31]There's stuff going on here.
[162:01.83]You probably don't want to be alone.
[162:02.96]Turn my back for five seconds.
[162:04.90]And big dome over here.
[162:06.92]Follow me out of the room.
[162:09.12]I don't want to go in there.
[162:10.56]Where's he gone?
[162:11.00]I don't know.
[162:11.98]What do you mean?
[162:12.62]I'm fine.
[162:13.16]I didn't do it.
[162:16.61]You what?
[162:17.97]Has anything happened?
[162:19.69]What do you got?
[162:20.47]Clues?
[162:20.91]I found a clue.
[162:23.84]Hey, how's your, uh... What was the clue?
[162:25.92]You have to say jinkies when you find a clue.
[162:27.87]It's a law.
[162:28.47]Jinkies.
[162:30.97]Thank you.
[162:34.26]Remember when, like, you do arts and crafts, and then you soak a paper in tea bags to create, like, that old-timey parchment look?
[162:42.87]It was one of those.
[162:44.25]Oh, oh.
[162:45.37]What happened to the bug?
[162:46.49]I get it.
[162:48.07]There was a bug that was down here with us.
[162:50.63]Where'd it go?
[162:51.95]I don't understand what's going on.
[162:55.28]Wheelchair guy is standing again, and he's doing some weird voodoo stuff.
[162:59.20]I'm actually terrified.
[163:01.12]Oh, shoot him.
[163:03.82]He keeps trying to convince me.
[163:10.25]Where's Jeremiah?
[163:11.03]Oh, OK.
[163:11.89]He's practicing.
[163:14.33]Oh, I'm sorry.
[163:15.69]I meant, where's Joe?
[163:17.89]Hey, my name is Joe.
[163:21.71]Don't forget it.
[163:22.16]Joe, you found any clues?
[163:23.74]Nah.
[163:25.50]You got anything in your hand?
[163:26.82]I don't trust that fucking bug, though.
[163:28.54]The bug is fucking freaking me out.
[163:30.82]Ian, the bug's got a gun.
[163:32.92]So at the moment, just until he drops the gun, you're best friends with the boss.
[163:44.75]What?
[163:45.49]What's going on?
[163:48.19]What did I... Did I just get killed out of the game?
[163:57.88]The whole thing crashed.
[164:02.69]Hold on.
[164:06.21]Oh, I don't trust the fucking bug at all.
[164:13.36]Are they still in?
[164:14.10]How did I get kicked out?
[164:19.70]Shit.
[164:24.19]Can I get back in if I open it again?
[164:33.90]Alright, I'm gonna open it again too.
[164:35.02]Will it put me back in where I was?
[164:36.46]Oh, the game ended for everybody too.
[164:39.58]Okay.
[164:42.22]I can request an invite.
[164:43.18]Yeah, that's fine.
[164:49.43]Alright.
[164:51.35]Alright.
[164:51.73]Dunkin' Donuts.
[164:52.27]Dunkin' Donuts.
[164:52.79]Fucking Patriots.
[164:53.55]Red Sox.
[164:54.07]Patriots.
[164:54.39]Dunkin' Donuts.
[164:56.19]Traffic.
[164:56.57]Cars.
[164:57.05]Fucking cars.
[164:57.65]I like cars.
[164:58.11]Traffic.
[164:58.45]Boston.
[164:59.17]Cars.
[165:00.69]I'm ready.
[165:16.72]Okay.
[165:20.76]Request an invite.
[165:36.82]Request invite.
[165:49.82]You know what?
[165:50.42]You know what?
[166:07.63]I think that's a little better.
[166:15.21]It's great.
[166:15.59]It's black.
[166:19.53]What?
[166:19.71]Oh, that was weird.
[166:25.36]I'm shrinking my guy.
[166:29.30]I feel like this guy wouldn't be this big.
[166:30.66]It's not like real fucking height.
[166:53.77]Hey.
[166:53.97]Hey, you're welcome back.
[166:57.92]Joe, everyone.
[166:58.66]It's Joe.
[167:02.04]Joe.
[167:02.68]Hey, what's up?
[167:03.96]Sorry.
[167:07.11]Joe, come over here.
[167:08.05]Hey, it's me.
[167:08.63]Joe, come here.
[167:09.21]Hey, hey, what's going on, man?
[167:10.61]Remember, hey, he's, he's, we're friends.
[167:12.63]The directed directions one, right?
[167:15.58]I fucking walk, I exercise, get over it.
[167:16.90]She here right now?
[167:17.62]Hey, what's up?
[167:18.16]She's throwing this shit at me right now.
[167:19.36]We're about to play with these people here, whatever they are.
[167:44.06]Yeah, I don't know.
[167:45.16]You told me about the party, Joe.
[167:47.22]You should know them.
[167:49.38]No, it was a random Facebook invite.
[167:50.85]I just accepted it.
[167:51.63]I don't know.
[167:53.35]Oh, God.
[168:00.12]Alright, so I was supposed to entertain a birthday party.
[168:03.96]No one told me anything.
[168:05.40]Who the hell invited Kingpin?
[168:07.59]As Delta Psi Beta brothers, we need to stick together.
[168:10.09]I don't know what we're doing.
[168:11.73]I think we're playing some little party game?
[168:14.78]I was a senior when you were a freshman, so I didn't really give a shit.
[168:19.10]We took you under our wings and we told you these things.
[168:23.29]You gotta fly, man.
[168:24.09]You gotta fly.
[168:24.69]I can't make you fly.
[168:26.13]Really?
[168:28.50]Hey, what's up?
[168:31.28]Are you Facebook friends with him?
[168:33.00]Connected somehow?
[168:34.86]I think so.
[168:37.03]It was the house party.
[168:38.73]There's not a lot of people here, though.
[168:42.17]Somebody sent me an invite to come here, and I clicked it.
[168:44.64]I think he's plus one.
[168:47.15]Is that what it is?
[168:47.99]No, I'm kidding.
[168:48.87]No, you're not.
[168:49.66]No.
[168:50.40]What the?
[168:50.88]No, no.
[168:51.16]You guys got me confused with... Oh, you guys are talking about Nick.
[168:54.66]No, I'm Tim.
[168:56.36]That's... That's our other classmates.
[168:58.40]You kind of got it wrong, but it's like, whatever.
[169:00.16]It's fine.
[169:00.86]It's probably going to be like... Oh, my God.
[169:03.21]I'm at the kitchen.
[169:03.93]I need a drink.
[169:05.27]Yeah, I'm going to get something, too.
[169:06.61]We don't know what's the next costume.
[169:08.29]We haven't paid for anything yet.
[169:09.71]Hello.
[169:12.81]I don't...
[169:14.51]I don't think that's really appropriate to do.
[169:15.87]I mean, this isn't your house, you know.
[169:17.25]Somebody's already gone through all the doors and eaten all the cheddar.
[169:20.10]Somebody got a knife just sitting here?
[169:21.72]I mean, come on.
[169:22.82]This is a dining room.
[169:23.62]It's rather dangerous.
[169:25.38]That does seem a little fucking dangerous.
[169:26.80]I'm not going to lie.
[169:27.66]I don't know if I want to touch that.
[169:29.24]Never mind.
[169:29.64]It's glued to the table.
[169:30.85]Is it?
[169:32.75]Let me try.
[169:33.77]Yeah, I saw about that.
[169:36.07]Don't decide beta.
[169:37.92]Dude, dude, dude, stop, stop, stop.
[169:41.03]Stop talking about college.
[169:42.33]It's fucking over.
[169:43.73]I'm 38.
[169:43.95]You're 34.
[169:44.65]Like, just don't worry.
[169:45.51]Forget about it.
[169:47.11]Who cares?

[172:01.01]I came in here and I was looking out the window.
[172:03.01]He fa- Wait, did I run out of time?
[172:05.35]What?
[172:05.61]I was gonna kill that guy.
[172:28.31]That was it?
[172:29.05]I thought, oh my god, okay.
[172:32.85]I've spent so much time talking about my fucking body.
[172:35.61]I was gonna kill him, I was gonna kill him, I was talking about, yeah, I can't believe it.
[172:41.49]I don't know, I have no clue.
[172:42.89]All I did was talk to people.
[172:45.07]You guys literally ran the clock out.
[172:47.59]You ran the clock out.
[172:48.85]Nothing, no one got killed.
[172:50.31]I can't believe nobody got, what a bad murderer.

[173:21.72]Oh my god.
[173:22.12]The whole game.
[173:24.42]Yeah, because I switched avatars.
[173:27.60]And it won't work otherwise.
[173:28.92]Can I use the scum?
[173:30.38]It's like... Can I?
[173:31.06]Let me see that, please.
[173:38.29]Don't mean it.
[173:39.15]I'll look at it.
[173:40.05]Be careful.
[173:40.69]Don't misfire that.
[173:41.85]We've had a bad... We've had some incidents in the past.
[173:45.17]Just drop it.
[173:45.81]Let me block your avatar.
[173:47.71]Thank you.
[173:48.11]Alright!
[173:48.47]I love you!
[173:53.42]Hey, hey!
[173:54.84]What the f- what the fuck, man?
[173:58.36]What the fuck are you talking about?

[174:22.94]I just... I killed Eric.
[174:24.36]Yeah, nah, I mean...
[174:32.79]I think, I think Eye for an Eye is a fair trade on this mishap.
[174:36.77]I think that was a little bit ridiculous.
[174:39.84]I thought I was holding a Nerf gun.
[174:42.90]Shoot that motherfucker.
[174:45.48]Nerf guns are made of steel.
[174:47.32]Thank you very much.

[174:58.46]My mother?
[174:59.26]Oh, you're talking about my mother now.
[175:00.68]That's what it is?
[175:01.26]Can you give me the gun?
[175:02.08]Let me try.

[184:47.89]Hey!
[184:48.41]What are you doing here?
[184:55.57]What's going on in here?
[185:03.96]I was looking for these little pieces of paper that I'm finding around.
[185:08.98]You just ran in this room and you decided to come and you didn't want to talk to any of the guests?
[185:13.60]You just wanted to run in here and look for a knife or a weapon or something?
[185:17.56]No.
[185:19.22]I don't want a knife.
[185:20.30]You sure?
[185:21.04]You sure you're not trying to get that?
[185:22.58]Yeah.
[185:24.18]I'm sure.
[185:24.50]I'm just looking for something to eat, I guess.
[185:26.43]I don't know.
[185:27.23]Okay.
[185:27.69]Okay.
[185:28.19]I respect that.
[185:29.91]There's no food in somebody's bookcase.
[185:32.49]I don't know if you know that.
[185:35.01]I suppose.
[185:35.59]You're right.
[185:36.35]Let me go ahead and close this door real quick so it's nice and private in here.
[185:41.00]If anyone was to grab a knife at this point and try to kill me, they would have a pretty good opportunity.
[185:44.90]I don't think anyone could hear me speak.
[185:48.19]What are you doing?
[185:50.75]I'm trying to get clues.
[185:55.07]Anyways, if you have fun in this room, I'm going to leave.
[185:58.91]Yeah.
[186:00.73]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[186:07.05]That's him.
[186:08.01]That's the guy.
[186:09.13]That's the guy.
[186:10.99]That's the guy.
[186:11.61]I saw a knife.
[186:12.57]A knife just fell.
[186:13.78]A knife just fell out of his pocket.
[186:17.42]It fell right there.
[186:18.44]Look at Exhibit A. Exhibit A. Exhibit A. Right there.
[186:28.01]What?
[186:30.37]What?
[186:32.43]It wasn't even him?
[186:33.55]We can see an overhead view of what everyone's doing.
[186:36.64]Oh, my God.
[186:37.04]Oh, God.
[186:37.58]I... Who was it?
[186:38.30]Who was it?
[186:38.74]Was it Burn?
[186:40.24]It was IQ.
[186:43.43]That was hard.
[186:43.99]It was terrible.
[186:45.87]It was terrible.
[186:56.84]If I didn't have my followers support, you know, thank you for telling me that I gained a follower.
[187:04.57]That was pretty sick.
[187:05.67]It really gave me the motivation to carry on, you know?
[187:07.92]Like, I do it for the stream.
[187:09.26]I do it for the viewers.

[188:01.94]It's like a fourth of it, you know?
[188:04.75]Response, you are not buff enough to throw 90 miles per hour.
[188:08.79]I'm soccer mom now.

[188:26.84]Dude, she always climbs to the front house and tries to like... That's family feud.
[188:30.78]It just ruins it, man.
[188:32.52]Do they have family feud in this game?
[188:35.64]That'd be amazing.
[188:45.47]I'm the Roomba.

[189:45.20]I need to give you a one-minute briefing.
[189:56.01]Okay.
[190:25.27]I didn't get banned.
[190:30.88]He picked the knife up.
[190:34.00]That's the killer, right?
[190:40.48]That's what that means?
[190:48.43]That wasn't RTM.
[190:51.13]I saw a knife in his hand, so I had to instantly shoot him.
[190:56.91]Innocents can pick them up?
[190:58.45]No, they can't.
[190:59.05]Innocents cannot pick up knives.
[191:07.38]Oh my God.
[191:09.56]Let's go back in.
[191:14.78]No, I got it right.
[191:15.46]He picked the knife up and just, I reacted.
[191:29.65]1000 IQ play.
[191:34.43]I was gonna make them all sing.
[191:35.45]I was gonna make them all sing, and if they didn't, whoever was out of key died.
[191:39.25]I tried.
[191:43.36]Alright, let's go.
[192:01.07]Yeah, if there's like a family feud, that would be so much fun.
[192:06.47]Or even like a Jeopardy or something.
[192:13.76]Oh, a band.
[192:14.26]I was gonna say, what?
[192:17.28]Alright, glue man.
[192:23.88]We had a little bit of an issue.
[192:27.56]Speaking of issues, my cord is kind of going crazy.
[193:01.60]This is so awesome though, it really is.
[193:05.58]This like, this took time and work.
[193:07.10]This is like, bravo.
[193:08.46]This is fucking amazing.
[193:16.59]I want to just pancake somebody in the face.
[193:18.36]You know, like, just like... Floss as glue man.
[193:33.69]No.
[193:36.83]No.
[193:39.91]I'm not going to do that.
[193:49.79]Look at these muscles, they're just fucking huge.
[193:55.41]Hey look, there we go.
[194:00.47]Aw, dab!
[194:00.94]Oh wait, is this a new room?
[194:14.62]Whoa.
[194:18.86]What is this, new?
[194:26.85]This is nice.
[194:28.05]I got booted.
[194:41.39]I need to take a seat.
[194:43.65]Pen control?
[194:46.35]Clear pens?
[194:47.55]Just... What is this?
[194:48.67]Oh, it's for these.
[194:50.21]You can draw.
[194:51.89]What?
[194:53.05]Are we gonna do like a big giant...
[194:56.16]Drawing?
[194:57.58]Oh, wow, that's cool.
[195:00.20]Yeah.
[195:00.92]Play Pictionary.
[195:04.60]We could do Pictionary.
[195:05.84]That would be fun.
[195:13.20]Oh, why am I so shaky?
[195:17.11]This is so sad.
[195:18.31]This is any time I try and draw in VR, I'm just...
[195:23.37]Yeah, I guess it's because you don't have anything to steady your hand on.
[195:26.09]This is so sad.
[195:30.80]It's a pizza.
[195:37.52]It's a... It's a man who's dead inside.
[195:39.14]There he is.
[195:53.21]I drew you.
[195:55.67]That looks great.
[195:56.81]Oh wow, good job.
[196:00.27]Don't mind if I do.
[196:00.92]That's actually really good.
[196:22.91]What are you drawing over here?
[196:39.12]Me.
[196:39.26]You?
[196:53.73]Oh, now it feels like I'm in school.
[196:56.21]It's just everyone doing arts and crafts around the table.
[197:00.61]It's just me, school.
[197:02.45]Oh, look at that.
[197:03.29]Look at that.
[197:04.15]Well done.
[197:04.99]Look at you go.
[197:06.61]It's a bicycle.
[197:09.69]What is it?
[197:10.45]It's just me and the school.
[197:15.72]Oh, wow.
[197:18.10]What are you doing to the school?
[197:20.66]That's research.
[197:25.65]I think he's going to grow up to be an artist.
[197:29.81]Yes, and what can I help you with?
[197:37.16]Would you like a juice box?
[197:39.36]Yes, and I just gave a cookie.
[197:45.84]A cookie?
[197:46.94]Right.
[197:47.94]Well, um...
[197:50.11]Sweetie, we might have to use the power of imagination for a juice box and a cookie.
[197:56.50]Oh, those cookies.
[197:59.10]Oh, do you like the raisin ones?
[198:00.65]No, no, no.
[198:01.45]No, just chocolate chip cookies.
[198:31.63]I think you need a crayon.
[198:34.57]Doctor.
[198:36.99]Doctor.
[198:40.09]Right, don't dribble.
[198:41.47]Don't get it down your face.
[198:43.53]Your parents will be livid.
[198:45.62]Mom?
[198:48.58]She's not here yet.
[198:49.38]Oh.
[198:49.52]She's going to pick you up after school.
[198:52.26]Oh, okay.
[198:52.76]You want me to show her your work?
[198:57.50]Bathroom.
[198:59.91]Right, um, okay, you got a bathroom section?
[199:03.57]Help, help, help.
[199:05.33]Will you hold his hand and take him to the bathroom, please?
[199:07.94]Okay.
[199:08.42]Please.
[199:14.48]I got it.
[199:15.16]Party.
[199:18.12]Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[199:20.14]It's back here.
[199:21.06]It's back here.
[199:21.68]Uh, right, right on this.
[199:26.60]That's the toilet.
[199:28.36]Just, uh,
[199:32.06]That's the urinal, that's not the toilet.
[199:35.20]That's like that over here, that's like the toilet.
[199:38.23]You're kinda pulling your pants down for the urinal.
[199:40.57]What have you done?
[200:03.54]Sweetie, you've made a bit of a mess on the chest there, haven't you?
[200:07.13]There's glue everywhere.
[200:09.95]That is okay.
[200:17.11]My picture!
[200:17.85]Ow!
[200:19.61]It's not even my picture.
[200:24.19]See you next time.
[200:26.71]Okay.
[200:26.87]See you next time.
[200:28.75]Thank you for hanging out.
[200:31.29]Nice to meet you.
[200:32.92]Yeah, keep up the good artwork, man.
[200:36.02]Okay, I'm going to go wash this off now.
[200:38.16]Bye.
[200:41.30]You ruined my picture, though.
[200:43.94]Well, I don't think I did, because as you see here, you had some line work that I needed to fix for you.
[200:48.63]And the hair was a little too messy.
[200:50.53]I figured maybe I would, like, change it out of the kind of the toupee scenario here.
[200:55.55]The eyes were a little off, too.
[200:56.61]Well, personally, if you look at it from, like, a different sort of angle, you know, like, from, like, this side...
[201:02.06]Like, you'd understand, like, the line work is done, like, it's sort of my style I've done here, like, specifically the line was meant to be viewed from, like, a more, like, precise angle.
[201:11.38]Yeah, yeah.
[201:11.92]Well, look, it's still the mind.
[201:13.12]I take a lot of influence.
[201:14.70]I think Jack Pollock is my influence here.
[201:18.56]So, that's probably what I was doing.
[201:20.53]Any chance on that cookie and juice box you mentioned earlier?
[201:23.23]I just was... Wait, wait, sorry, sorry about that.
[201:25.99]You mentioned, like, I asked for, like, a cookie and we were talking about it for a little bit, so...
[201:30.64]Um, oh yeah, no, no, that's the thing.
[201:32.88]It's more about, um, like, expressing yourself, and have you ever seen the movie Hook?
[201:37.90]Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
[201:38.34]They all sit around the table, and they all think about, they all think about, like, what they're gonna eat, and it looks like Play-Doh, and you try to eat the Play-Doh, and then you realize it's disgusting, and you look like a twat in front of all your friends.
[201:52.43]Yeah, it's just like that.
[201:54.70]Just like that.
[201:56.80]Juicebox, nice man, now you speak my language.
[201:58.52]Where are we at?
[202:00.50]Right here, right here, right here.
[202:01.68]Right here?
[202:02.44]Alright, let me come over here.
[202:04.62]Juice box for me?
[202:06.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[202:07.84]You see it right here?
[202:08.66]You're inside of it.
[202:09.54]It's like this right here.
[202:10.80]That's the juice box.
[202:12.18]Let me give it a sip and see how it is.
[202:17.04]Ah.
[202:17.24]Yay!
[202:18.46]That's delicious.
[202:21.21]That's very, very good.
[202:23.57]There's a cookie right here as well.
[202:26.01]Move.
[202:29.85]No, get away.
[202:31.93]Get away from me.
[202:34.94]It's gonna be a cookie, come on.
[202:37.90]He's possessive, it's like a dog.
[202:39.40]Get away from me!
[202:40.28]2, 3, 4, 5, what?
[203:00.54]Did you wear your seatbelt here this time?
[203:02.16]Like today?
[203:02.68]Did you wear your seatbelt here?
[203:05.31]Is there Jeopardy?
[203:06.37]Or like Wheel of Fortune?
[203:07.53]Or like Family Feud?
[203:09.89]Is there actually?
[203:10.71]There could be.
[203:11.49]I don't know.
[203:13.01]That movie's so much fun.
[203:16.23]Okay.
[203:17.59]These guys play a lot if you want to find an old game show.
[203:26.04]Normally it's stuff like Hot Potato
[203:28.76]Oh, really?
[203:29.70]That's so much fun.
[203:30.80]I think that'd be kind of cool.
[203:32.72]Is it past the grenade?
[203:35.85]Just search grenade, you'll probably find it.
[203:37.71]Let me see.
[203:38.29]Yeah, let me try too.
[203:55.55]Grenade.
[203:56.95]I'm running out of gas.
[203:57.89]He's scared that he's not acting.
[204:04.93]It's fine.
[204:08.50]Literally just passed the grenade.
[204:10.26]Okay.
[204:11.96]Oh, there it is.
[204:12.44]Wait, hold on.
[204:14.02]Is it in?
[204:16.08]Yeah.
[204:19.36]Whenever y'all are... This is the one?
[204:21.54]Sweet.
[204:24.77]Let's do it.
[204:34.52]Boomer babysitter, that's so fucking funny.
[204:37.98]Well, that last thing made some sense, though.
[204:40.76]I don't even know what I hit my hand on.
[204:41.80]Template, okay.
[204:42.20]Don't do it!
[204:42.54]It's gonna hurt you!
[205:02.98]So it's hot potato with a grenade.
[205:05.35]Yeah, pretty much.
[205:08.83]It's pretty spooky.
[205:10.47]I don't think we really need to read the rules for it as well.
[205:13.15]It's pretty self-explanatory.
[205:16.31]Going in one direction.
[205:17.23]It says to go around, okay.
[205:18.99]I would like to... I want to drink wine.
[205:32.81]Get away from that.
[205:35.48]You get away from that.
[205:36.78]Wait, what?
[205:41.40]How do I get it?
[205:44.60]Lucky number.
[205:46.21]So let's pick a number?
[205:46.93]That's my number.
[205:48.17]10.
[205:49.01]Yeah, pick a number.
[205:51.45]No, you don't even know.
[205:53.67]No, we don't need numbers.
[205:54.87]What?
[205:55.09]Yeah, we never did numbers.
[205:56.67]No, we don't.
[205:57.25]Oh, you don't need numbers?
[205:58.22]We've run for our lives.
[206:01.74]Oh, we are?
[206:06.21]We start- Who's- Is it like dodgeball?
[206:09.15]Oh, you have- There you go.
[206:11.79]Oh, I didn't think-
[206:30.01]You just killed it!
[206:31.19]You just killed it!
[206:32.88]How do I grab it?
[206:35.02]Just grab it!
[206:35.84]Bounce it!
[206:40.80]It's stuck on... It's yours!
[206:42.02]You get it!
[206:43.04]It's mine!
[206:44.16]No!
[206:47.70]I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[206:48.90]I'm not good at throwing.
[206:50.54]You better... You just held...
[207:11.14]It's closer to you.
[207:18.83]It's closer to you.
[207:19.81]It's closer to you.
[207:20.43]It's closer to you.
[207:21.31]Take it.
[207:21.63]Oh, that's going to throw it.
[207:29.59]Hey, no, no, no.
[207:49.47]I'm going to knock something over.
[207:54.03]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[208:02.10]Did I spill something on the desk?
[208:12.00]I might've.
[208:16.10]Oh no.
[208:18.50]Oh, no.
[208:19.73]Why?
[208:20.11]Why?
[208:20.61]Why would you do this to me?
[208:22.11]Well, I mean, if you want it.
[208:25.95]It's playing very dangerously.
[208:29.41]You can watch it.
[208:32.19]Oh, God.
[208:32.59]Oh, God.
[208:33.63]No, fly.
[208:36.70]Oh, shit.
[208:37.18]Oh, shit.
[208:38.26]Oh, my God.
[208:38.78]I can't throw up.
[208:39.34]Save my life.
[208:43.50]What?
[208:44.26]Why didn't you die?
[208:46.42]I don't know.
[208:51.29]Oh, that's bullshit.
[208:57.56]That's bullshit.
[208:58.72]Oh my god.
[209:26.75]That wasn't right.
[209:27.89]That was cheating.
[209:31.22]That was a quarter of a second timer.
[209:35.52]That was... I guess that was it.
[209:37.44]Ty's winning.
[209:38.90]Congratulations.
[209:40.18]I guess.
[209:40.68]Yeah, I guess.
[209:42.91]New position.
[209:52.19]This cord is giving me problems.
[209:57.63]Trying to kick it?
[209:59.59]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[210:02.69]No!
[210:02.81]No!
[210:30.47]Wait, it's going already!
[210:38.30]Oh my fucking god, come on man.
[210:43.98]Holy shit, there it goes!
[210:58.15]Sometimes you gotta just go for it, right?
[211:07.58]No!
[211:25.54]Oh, the softball windmill technique.
[211:31.05]Um, it's not gonna... Okay.
[211:57.84]Yeah, sure.
[211:59.64]I don't know.
[212:00.54]He's taking his time, too.
[212:02.72]I have to use it to play baseball.
[212:09.82]Where is it?
[212:14.05]Oh.
[212:16.21]I'll get it.
[212:19.07]I'll get it.
[212:20.35]Alright, let's go.
[212:42.34]I'm just going in a circle.
[212:43.74]I'm playing like catch outside without... Oh, hits the sky block, shit.
[213:10.99]Wait, is this me versus me?
[213:24.17]You gotta, no, you gotta, you gotta, take it, take it.
[213:30.25]You gotta.
[213:30.79]It's yours.
[213:33.59]Oh, I'm just like, here.
[213:38.86]Keep grabbing it.
[213:39.48]I don't know why it's not blowing up.
[213:41.40]I don't know.
[213:42.40]They're having a moment.
[213:44.24]Come on, stand next to it.
[213:47.22]I didn't kill him.
[213:49.66]Why did it kill you?
[213:50.90]Anybody thirsty?
[213:53.69]Go back in.
[213:57.45]Screw it.
[213:58.71]I'm going back in.
[214:00.25]I could take that off your hands if you don't want it.
[214:03.15]Don't take it.
[214:05.05]I'm thirsty.
[214:07.25]Can I have a drink, please?
[214:10.61]I fucked up the game, though I think I should be the one that sets it up.
[214:18.68]Why?
[214:19.26]He won't let me die!
[214:21.36]Why?
[214:23.94]Why?
[214:25.54]I don't understand.
[214:26.26]I'm trying to get rid of- I'm trying to eliminate myself.
[214:33.37]I'm seriously trying to eliminate myself.
[214:46.02]Sorry my arms are too strong.
[214:49.78]I shouldn't throw that far He can never throw it
[215:14.72]It always just freezes two seconds in front of his face.
[215:18.70]Oh, that's so cool.
[215:19.54]Your glue was on it.
[215:29.95]Oh, fancy.
[215:30.63]Uh-oh.
[215:33.01]What kind of shoes are these?
[215:39.78]I guess they're supposed to be cleats.
[215:41.72]That's the technique.
[215:42.70]He just walks it over.
[215:47.09]Alright, so what happens if nobody goes near it?
[215:51.27]Does it just pick a random person?
[215:54.15]I'd must.
[215:55.37]I think it might be who's ever zoned it.
[215:58.45]Oh my god.
[216:00.05]Mac, did your voice get deeper again?
[216:01.85]That face.
[216:04.52]It just sounds like it is.
[216:06.04]Is it getting deeper and deeper and deeper?
[216:09.84]Oh.
[216:10.62]Yeah, deeper again.
[216:14.22]Oh.
[216:15.00]Oh.
[216:15.34]Yeah, you get it.
[216:22.37]This game is cruel.
[216:24.79]Uh-oh.
[216:25.61]Uh-oh.
[216:25.97]I'm surprised it didn't go off yet.
[216:37.20]Why me?
[216:37.92]God, why me?
[216:40.12]Are we missing a couple?
[216:49.56]I think Josh, maybe.
[216:50.68]I think he's trying to... Oh, gosh.
[216:53.86]Good throw.
[216:54.82]Yeah, it's the high arcing throws.
[216:58.90]Those are the ones that matter.
[217:00.32]I don't know.
[217:00.86]It won't stop.
[217:01.54]I'm just kind of drifting in space right now.
[217:03.80]I don't know.
[217:04.52]Yeah, it is.
[217:06.04]Yay!
[217:07.30]Yay!
[217:08.74]I'm like ping pong.
[217:11.10]Oh, wait.
[217:13.91]I think I'm good.
[217:15.24]I just unplugged my headset.
[217:16.22]I'm gonna just observe, I think.
[217:18.12]Alright, I got good hands.
[217:26.19]I got it.
[217:28.85]Coming to you, by the way.
[217:31.23]Coming to you.
[217:37.12]He was pointing at you, not me.
[217:38.18]Just wanted to make that clear.
[217:44.84]What?
[217:44.96]Why?
[217:45.06]What?
[217:45.26]Are you still alive?
[217:51.34]Why am I?
[217:51.87]I haven't.
[217:52.19]Okay, um.
[218:12.87]Good thing I had my fraps open.
[218:14.19]Oh god.
[218:15.41]Can't pick it up.
[218:23.94]I don't... There you go.
[218:37.21]What?
[218:37.65]I'll be right back.
[218:38.41]No, no, no, no.
[218:40.03]No, no, no, no.
[218:42.47]Oh, no.
[218:43.49]That was a dead man.
[218:45.31]No, no, no, no.
[218:47.95]No.
[218:48.19]Oh, no, no.
[218:51.61]I ain't going over there.
[218:55.23]Alright, man.
[218:57.20]Second shorthand.
[218:58.72]I thought it was on the ground.
[218:59.68]It just blows up.
[219:01.44]Someone had to get it.
[219:12.04]Uh-oh.
[219:13.70]Oh!
[219:14.48]Oh.
[219:39.01]So this is the deadliest, most deadly game of console.
[219:56.77]Damn it.
[219:57.19]It looks like a touching father-son bonding exercise, but no.
[220:00.76]You can do it, son.
[220:01.86]Don't touch the grenade!
[220:03.74]Don't touch it!
[220:04.26]No!
[220:06.60]Did you bring it up here?
[220:11.55]Who does it explode?
[220:14.21]Everyone.
[220:16.19]Where is it?
[220:17.07]It's in here.
[220:17.61]It's in here!
[220:18.11]Oh, I did die.
[220:33.92]Where is it?
[220:36.30]I'll take it back into the arena.
[220:39.22]Oh, does somebody have it?
[220:40.60]Oh, I'm supposed to be down there.
[220:48.37]Oh my god.
[221:06.00]Alright, put it down on the center and everybody just go stare at it and see what happens.
[221:19.98]We're all waiting for like the microwave for our pasta to be done.
[221:24.17]What's going on?
[221:27.23]Well...
[221:36.87]Can we set the timer to, like, four minutes?
[221:39.39]I remember I once did that.
[221:41.64]What's going on right now?
[221:42.64]I just came back.
[221:43.48]What's, uh... Can't you see?
[221:46.00]Ew.
[221:46.58]Enjoying the show.
[221:49.38]Ah, okay.
[221:49.78]Watching a watermelon grow.
[221:50.86]Does this explode?
[221:53.25]I don't think it explodes.
[221:54.79]Um, what if I walk over it?
[221:56.39]Okay.
[221:56.77]Um, hey.
[221:57.79]Just leave it there, yeah.
[221:59.81]Fine.
[222:06.43]It's like VRChat with a grenade simulator.
[222:08.31]This is the future of gaming.
[222:10.97]I love it so much.
[222:13.47]Oh, where'd it go?
[222:16.13]Oh.
[222:16.73]Yeah, put it back there.
[222:18.91]I just made it worse.
[222:20.27]It was set up perfectly, too.
[222:22.99]Here, here, here, here.
[222:23.91]Just there.
[222:24.97]Oh, it's falling over.
[222:26.41]Monkey, can you get that, please?
[222:28.03]We're using our force.
[222:30.03]Well, let Monkey get it.
[222:31.47]I asked him to get it.
[222:32.43]It's a grenade Ouija board.
[222:35.66]Maybe if I sit on it like an emperor penguin.
[222:39.98]Oh, I don't know if you can watch that.
[222:41.40]Oh wow.
[223:00.96]There's nothing right- Sid, this is nature.
[223:02.39]This happens in nature.
[223:08.31]Sid, the egg doesn't explode.
[223:12.51]Me too, huh?
[223:17.92]I died.
[223:18.72]I'm trying to kick it.
[223:21.12]I got a trick, guys.
[223:22.00]Can I show you my trick?
[223:24.32]Are you gonna lay an egg?
[223:27.00]No, no, no.
[223:29.23]I got them both.
[223:32.78]That was a really good trick.
[223:41.60]That was pretty sick.
[223:43.00]That was actually really cool.
[223:47.64]That was really cool.
[223:49.28]Throw that up there, Adam.
[223:50.80]Get him.
[223:51.10]Get him.
[224:06.24]Uh-oh.
[224:07.96]I'm sure I'm gonna get fucking murdered.
[224:11.50]He's gonna float up.
[224:15.66]Oh, God.
[224:16.04]Bye.
[224:16.42]See you later.
[224:22.11]Everyone salute him.
[224:23.19]Salute him.
[224:24.77]I gotta go to Mars.
[224:28.11]Why has he stopped?
[224:30.49]Sky blocks.
[224:31.65]Oh, there he goes again.
[224:33.07]What?
[224:33.35]What?
[224:41.19]You can't see him!
[224:44.53]Why has it not exploded?
[224:48.31]Why did it take so long?
[225:05.56]I wonder if there is the... Oh my god, this is insane.
[225:14.10]I'll take a look and see if there's game show stuff too.
[225:20.06]Yeah, that'd be fun.
[225:21.46]If they got like... Yeah, you gotta fix it.
[225:34.52]Like a knockoff, right?
[225:38.31]Hey, can you hold this, please?
[225:40.01]Yeah, sure.
[225:40.93]Thanks.
[225:41.59]I aimed it, please.
[225:48.59]I'm getting this thing.
[225:49.69]I want this thing gone.
[225:51.56]Yeah, we need to put that in the container.
[225:52.98]You guys can actually get rid of it.
[225:54.24]Yep.
[225:54.36]Yeah, you can get rid of this grenade.
[225:57.88]Yeah, get rid of it.
[225:58.60]Some search Jeopardy.
[225:59.58]I'll be right back.
[226:00.28]I got my mission.
[226:02.02]I'll take it to Mars with me.
[226:05.37]Is there a way to search, Gemo?
[226:06.41]Um, you just have to search through the worlds with the search icon up at the top right.
[226:12.16]Oh, okay.
[226:12.56]Let's see, like... You have to be facing where you want to place the portal, for the record.
[226:21.10]Oh, okay.
[226:21.82]Just try to put it on the glass, and sometimes it doesn't like that.
[226:24.68]Oh, Gemo found something.
[226:26.00]Guys, I found, um, a... I found somewhere suitable.
[226:30.90]Ooh.
[226:32.00]Maybe.
[226:33.28]Oh my god, are you serious?
[226:36.36]Yeah, absolutely.
[226:37.44]I heard the explosion.
[226:50.23]This is my realm!
[226:51.07]This is where I belong!
[227:00.78]Oh, no.
[227:02.89]The hell is it, Paul?
[227:04.71]I know exactly what's about to happen.
[227:07.61]Oh, God.
[227:11.47]Alright, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.
[227:15.59]Hey, you.

[227:24.60]It's buggy.
[227:25.91]Oh my god.
[227:27.28]The ladder is really buggy.
[227:28.44]Oops.
[227:29.38]It's not fine.
[227:33.02]It's not fine.
[227:37.08]Can you jump on this?
[227:38.08]I can jump on this.
[227:41.23]How do you get in here?

[227:51.84]Right hand top.
[227:53.64]Can you go through these?
[227:58.10]You gotta use a bit of imagination, like, you know, just like... Like that, you know?
[228:05.92]Well, hold on.
[228:06.72]I'm having trouble here.
[228:10.25]Josh is here.
[228:11.23]I thought that was me.
[228:13.17]I swear to God, I thought that was me on screen.
[228:14.83]I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[228:16.19]Why is that here?
[228:18.99]I thought it was me.

[229:04.51]Oh.
[229:06.15]I'm going to hurt myself, so I'm going to untangle this.

[229:16.76]Hold on.
[229:17.26]What are you going to do?
[229:19.68]Hold on a second.
[229:20.22]You're going to make your entrance through here.
[229:21.58]Back here.

[229:57.93]I will get hurt if this doesn't become untangled.
[230:03.89]You can see the guy breaks his arm in VR if I don't fucking do this.
[230:19.54]Found a custom game show map?
[230:20.86]Alright, cool.
[230:21.35]Am I muted?

[230:52.02]Hey, brother.
[230:52.94]You don't own that.
[230:54.80]Are you going to be pulling the contestants out one at a time?
[230:57.40]What is wrong with his legs?
[231:00.20]Something going on there.
[231:02.08]Alright, sorry.
[231:02.62]I had to take my headset off.
[231:04.57]So what is the plan?
[231:06.29]Can everybody hear me?
[231:08.87]Yeah.
[231:09.13]For the most part?
[231:12.99]Yeah, if you get thrown.
[231:13.63]Was it?
[231:13.79]Oh, yeah.
[231:20.11]lose if they drop through a hole in the floor oh that's hilarious and we definitely have to try that um I that I love that avatar so much so if you get it's getting thrown over the top rope is elimination right I mean that's just the way it is yeah however you know you get eliminated every like minute or two somebody else can get called out
[231:46.70]Who wants to be, like, the person that's doing that?
[231:48.99]Who wants to call everybody out?
[231:51.75]Who wants to wrestle?
[231:53.97]We can actually fly over the top rope.
[231:58.45]We'll probably be the first to die.
[232:00.49]Yeah, the only downside is we can't hear from all the way down there, so it's gonna be... There's no avatars back here.
[232:09.96]There's no referee one, though, I don't think.
[232:11.76]How about we all just go in at the same time?
[232:13.30]We all get to do our intros at the same time.
[232:16.89]Sorry, everybody come back into the entrance.
[232:22.16]They all come out at the same time.
[232:23.48]You have to outperform one another.
[232:26.82]Yeah, it's a big performance.
[232:28.52]You better be ready.
[232:31.10]Play like every WWE theme.
[232:32.76]Yeah, every theme song has to be played.

[240:49.61]Alright, pin him!
[240:50.61]Pin him!

[241:34.35]Okay.
[241:40.67]Blue man got grazed by the table and falls over for a couple seconds.
[241:44.53]One, two, three, four.
[241:45.82]Dude, I haven't been pinned down right now.
[241:48.04]Okay.
[241:48.34]One, two.
[242:24.71]Are you booing me?
[242:25.89]You?
[242:26.27]I'm trying to hit that guy in the audience, right?
[242:28.88]He was booing me.
[242:29.26]Okay, off the ropes.
[242:30.36]Off the ropes.
[242:54.94]Oh, this guy's having a shit!
[242:59.18]Okay.
[242:59.46]I'm kidding.
[243:01.75]I'm kidding.
[243:02.31]You can have it back.
[243:04.03]It's very funny.
[243:27.04]Oh, God.
[243:27.62]This guy eating.
[243:29.18]This guy's puking.
[243:30.88]This guy's projectile throwing up into his hands.
[243:33.28]Look at him.
[243:35.58]That's pretty good.
[243:36.20]That's what's happening.
[243:36.82]This guy's on his phone in the middle of a wrestling match.
[243:40.09]You're standing on a chair, dum-dum.
[243:42.85]The question is, what arrow is this taking in?
[243:44.89]This doesn't seem like...
[244:00.13]Look behind the entrance.
[244:09.13]What's behind the entrance?
[244:18.28]Oh my goodness.
[244:22.10]Raw is war over that show.
[244:24.98]They still do Raw?
[244:28.46]Behind the entrance.
[244:33.37]What's back here?
[245:35.68]And their challenger has entered the ring.
[245:38.46]I don't know who the hell he is.
[245:39.74]Oh no.
[245:42.80]It's the big boss.
[245:45.94]What?
[245:47.26]Who the hell are you?
[245:48.66]Everybody, give him your money.
[245:53.05]Hey, I'll have you know.
[245:54.81]Hey, hey, pal.
[245:55.81]I won that belt.
[246:00.45]You want to eat this belt?
[246:03.11]Yeah, it looks pretty tasty.
[246:17.11]there's somebody in the ring waiting for you
[246:38.71]I think this is like the southeastern side of the ring.
[246:43.37]Some absolute jackass walks up and is about to beat the shit out of this guy.
[246:54.48]I don't think he's ready to fight exactly yet.
[247:02.29]It's very intense.
[247:03.59]The aroma here is very intense.
[247:05.65]It smells like sweat.
[247:06.69]It's disgusting.
[247:07.81]The aroma.
[247:10.47]I don't know what the hell they're doing at this point.
[247:12.81]They're supposed to be fighting, but they're just looking at each other really intensely.
[247:16.83]That's like half of wrestling.
[247:19.13]It's all about the stage presence.
[247:23.02]He's bouncing off the belts.
[247:27.19]Okay, he's grabbing the chair.
[247:36.20]And, uh... He's, uh... Oh!
[247:39.68]There's a struggle.
[247:40.78]He's trying to fight for the chair.
[247:42.11]The blue-haired guy's tweeting the shit out of the red guy with that chair.
[247:44.69]Oh, my God.
[247:52.52]Hey, hey, hey.
[247:52.82]Coming from the middle of the ring, it's the round.
[247:55.66]Come here.
[247:55.88]Oh, trash.
[248:21.11]What the hell's going on with your face?
[248:24.79]Alright, wait, what was the game show?
[248:27.00]I'm tired.
[248:28.60]I wanna get, I want a juice box.
[248:29.66]Uh, Kiwa, where's Kiwa?
[248:51.29]What was it called?
[248:56.49]It was like Zanu's Game Show or something, I don't remember.
[249:01.71]Zanu's, okay.
[249:05.08]I don't know, it started with an X. I am so tired.
[249:11.06]What do you have to say about, uh, got your win, sir?
[249:14.24]O'Hare, anime guy.
[249:17.69]Zenu.
[249:19.42]Zenu, does it come up if you just do game show?
[249:23.14]Game show is one word, yeah.
[249:24.38]Yeah, Zenu is game show.
[249:27.70]Word, game show.
[249:29.59]And if you just hit like invite plus or whatever and hit drop portal, you should be good to go.
[249:35.21]Oh yeah, Zenu is game show.
[249:38.29]So yeah, you select, you found the map, right?
[249:40.88]Yeah, new instance.
[249:42.95]Uh, yeah, new instance and then set, um, I guess what, invite plus, probably?
[249:46.76]Invite plus?
[249:49.92]Yeah, invite plus.
[249:52.40]Well, that would, invite only would only work if people are on a friend list.
[249:55.94]Yeah, invite plus will be good, because then you can invite Kiwo or whoever, and then they can invite the rest of us.
[250:02.68]Is Kiwo still up?
[250:03.98]The rest are coming down.
[250:05.22]Oh, there's Kiwo.
[250:05.86]Oh, is she mankind?
[250:06.66]She's doing her intro.
[250:09.89]Oh, alright, hold up, we gotta see this.

[251:26.82]Cactus Jack.
[251:28.26]Cactus Jack, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
[251:30.14]They have nothing to do with the cactus.
[251:32.48]I don't get what the name at all.
[251:35.88]He's from Arizona.
[251:39.11]okay okay close enough I still feel like it's a bit of a stretch personally we don't need your rp criticism here it's not a very good name you could have at least like you could have worn green or something get out of here
[252:03.78]Hey, no, no, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[252:14.07]Choke slam.
[252:16.75]Choke slam.
[252:18.55]I knew exactly what that was.
[252:20.59]I know a tombstone pile drive.
[252:23.13]Come here, Tracer.
[252:24.03]Oh, God, IQ, what the hell are you?
[252:27.39]My neck hurts.
[252:28.37]What is that?
[252:33.84]Uh, oh, I look like I need to use the bathroom.
[252:40.26]What?
[252:41.78]Look at me rest.
[252:43.10]I need to use the restroom.
[252:46.44]Oh, no.
[252:46.70]This is the best interview for WWE I've ever heard.
[252:52.50]Okay, but real talk, Poggle's standing in his seat to play.
[252:58.18]He'll fix it.
[253:00.90]I need to use the restroom.
[253:03.65]No, it's just when I do that, I keep spotting.
[253:10.31]Everybody, it's me.
[253:11.53]Everyone's favorite wrestleman.
[253:13.81]Cactus Jack.
[253:18.67]Tell your friends about me.
[253:23.39]So, Cactus, I heard you have a little bit of a problem down here.
[253:26.17]What's going on with the wardrobe here?
[253:30.90]What's wrong with it?
[253:36.01]I mean, you're peeing your pants or something or other.
[253:43.49]No, no, I haven't.
[253:45.35]I just need to use the restroom.
[253:48.69]I didn't go before I got called out here.
[253:50.89]I heard my name.
[253:51.59]I heard, it's Cactus Jack.
[253:53.79]And I was like, you know, this show must go on, you know?
[253:56.89]This is true.
[253:58.01]There are no bathrooms back there.
[253:59.85]Yeah, I think I'm going to be...
[254:04.65]You know, I'm going to be winging it.
[254:05.71]I'm probably going to throw the match anyway because I should.
[254:09.00]You know, it's not because I'm not a, you know, I'm a capable fighter and everything.
[254:15.89]I'm Cactus Jack, that guy.
[254:17.73]Why are you going to throw the fight?
[254:21.11]Because I need a way.
[254:25.02]Oh, well, that makes complete sense.
[254:26.42]You have to go to the bathroom, so why not just lie down, let him pin you, and then go to the bathroom?
[254:33.76]That sounds like a good idea.
[254:36.83]Exactly.
[254:39.13]Mic drop!
[254:42.25]Thank you.
[254:44.41]You guys want to do the game show?
[254:45.87]Yeah.
[254:48.65]It's the crow.
[254:49.57]The crow.
[254:51.82]The crow.
[255:03.21]Cactus Jack the Jabber.
[255:06.69]Alright, we're ready to go to Zinu's, whatever it is.
[255:12.12]Zinu's Game Show is what it's called.
[255:15.16]If you search Game Show, it'll come up.
[255:17.88]Should I do this?
[255:19.38]Because I only have three people out of here.
[255:21.20]I could do it.
[255:25.18]Or do you want to make the game show?
[255:26.22]Weak anyone watch some
[255:47.05]Alright, get on the table, get on the table.
[255:50.57]They're scouts. It's like the old Gmod videos.
[256:12.92]Force Awakens? Force Awakens?
[256:14.68]Oh, I can't wait.
[256:18.76]This is the game show.
[256:44.31]Don't buy this to me on that one.
[256:46.02]It was a shitty dumb reference Back until the game is over when there are two people left use questions with two possible answers that explains it pretty well Control board here
[257:13.06]And then the the the runner of the show stands on this side don't press any buttons yet And then you can you can close the the host wall here So once you hit that one nobody can walk in between the host side and the game side And this and then this audience button closes the audience off so they can't come back into the game interest and then basically what you do is like you say like I
[257:37.80]You say a multiple choice question with everybody standing out here, and the answer is either A, B, or C. And then you select the correct answer.
[257:45.64]Let's say it was A. Boom.
[257:48.00]Everybody except for A falls through, and then they spawn back in the audience side.
[257:52.07]So you have to come up with your own questions?
[257:53.43]There's no, like, built-in questions?
[257:54.99]Yeah, and there's actually, there's a reset button after you do that that resets it, and then the music button, you can kind of use that as a timer.
[258:03.37]Once the music ends, then you can hit the button.
[258:09.73]So like when you hit cage nobody else can choose an answer so if they either chose the wrong one or they can't switch last minute So you get a couple people to be host if you want It's really fun
[258:35.33]Should we let him go first, or who's going to be the host?
[258:38.55]Whoever wants to be host, go ahead.
[258:39.85]I mean, I could pull up, like, Halo trivia or something.
[258:42.79]Yeah, I think, like, it would make people fun to have, like, actual trivia questions rather than, like... Video game trivia or something.
[258:49.05]What's my aunt's name?
[258:50.21]Is it, like, Mary?
[258:52.09]You know.
[258:53.13]That's probably better with, like, actual trivia.
[258:54.53]Get out of me, Ty!
[258:58.40]I bet you didn't want to hear me say that, but I said it.
[259:05.33]Halo trivia.
[259:06.37]I've never even played Halo.
[259:09.37]I haven't either in a long time.
[259:11.42]I've never even opened the game.
[259:14.40]What would be a fun trivia set?
[259:17.22]Oh, I don't know.
[259:18.40]Diablo II, maybe?
[259:19.56]Diablo 3?
[259:20.34]Diablo II?
[259:20.80]Diablo II trivia?
[259:22.66]Has somebody wrote that?
[259:24.19]Yeah, I don't think it's even ever wrote it.
[259:26.79]I think I'm going to sit down today and write some Diablo II trivia questions.
[259:31.43]Yeah, like, what's the last boss of the game?
[259:34.27]Fucking Bale.
[259:35.01]Come on.
[259:36.29]Oh, my god.
[259:36.87]Oh, I remember Bale.
[259:40.05]Oh, Kiwo's here.
[259:41.23]Kiwo, you want to see how to run the game?
[259:44.09]OK.
[259:44.27]Come here.
[259:45.55]Are these chairs?
[259:47.43]So the host stands on this side.
[259:50.35]And everybody else stands over there.
[259:51.59]So everybody come stand over here right now.
[259:53.16]In the gray.

[260:17.77]The correct answer was A. Oh!
[260:22.11]Wait, what was- I didn't hear what A was.

[263:04.47]Well, I guess that was our round.
[263:05.87]I'm just going to have a little sit down.
[263:07.29]Yeah, let's sit down.
[263:09.84]Oh, I met that guy.
[263:11.60]I didn't know it was him, though.
[263:13.74]Everyone was going up to him like, oh, I really love your game.
[263:17.78]It's really great.
[263:19.40]It's just they're talking about Fahrenheit like the asshole I am.

[265:47.36]Is there like Twitch trivia or something?
[265:48.81]Like about streamers?
[265:51.31]What's attached here?
[266:08.75]Like, half of those questions are gonna be about Ninja or something, I guess.
[266:11.84]Some of these are so hard.
[266:17.80]Should I just do, like... generic trivia?
[266:22.46]You did.
[266:22.80]But you crashed.
[266:23.52]Your victory was you crashed.
[266:24.69]Oh!
[266:25.41]Wow!
[266:26.37]Cool.
[266:26.55]And then you crashed immediately.
[266:28.01]What do I win?
[266:28.35]What do I win?
[266:30.19]You crashed.
[266:30.99]He's driving a furry.
[266:32.27]Congrats!
[266:33.03]You can do whatever trivia you want.
[266:36.51]What's my cat- what's my parent's name?
[266:39.39]I don't want to be inside your place.
[266:41.60]That's definitely not Peter Griffin.
[266:43.08]It is absolutely not Peter Griffin.
[266:47.26]It's definitely Peter Griffin.
[266:53.22]I don't know what you mean.
[267:04.13]Is this a bird?
[267:05.73]I said my parent!
[267:07.21]Not my parents!
[267:08.13]Oh, I thought you said your parents.
[267:09.27]What's your parents' names?
[267:10.89]Uh, Peter Griffin.
[267:11.97]Yeah, Mr. Griffin.
[267:13.37]Peter, there is... Okay, okay.
[267:15.41]I do not... You are all crazy.
[267:16.82]There is no D. It's A, B, C. Why do you keep saying D?
[267:20.58]There's no D. Because it could be a third, it could be a fourth option.
[267:25.00]D is the gray area, obviously.
[267:27.04]Well, it doesn't matter because all of them are fake.
[267:28.72]I'm going to go get actual facts now.
[267:31.31]His real name is Kiwi.
[267:34.10]So we didn't even have an option.
[267:35.60]I knew they didn't sell.
[267:36.78]What the heck?
[267:40.30]He tried to kill us.
[267:41.66]Everybody thought he said that.
[267:44.25]Parents.
[267:45.87]I cannot find my phone, so I'm just going to use my Nintendo DSi browser.
[267:50.17]Hold on.
[267:50.91]Nintendo DS?
[267:54.05]Hold on.
[267:55.59]You're going to use your Nintendo DS browser?
[267:59.72]Uh-huh.
[268:03.91]I didn't think that even existed!
[268:06.39]I think it was like, yeah, you had to get the attachment card for it, but... What the fuck?
[268:10.53]What is the first ingredient... in... Haagen-Dazs... ice cream?
[268:14.34]Vanilla.
[268:33.79]Is it A, shortening, B, milk, or C, vanilla extract?
[268:45.41]What's the question?
[268:46.43]You're not even the host.
[268:47.37]You're absolutely crazy.
[268:48.29]You're crazy right now.
[268:49.39]I walked in from the audience and just decided to start.
[268:54.27]I'm sorry.
[268:55.93]That didn't, I'm sorry.
[268:57.48]It was not real.
[268:59.44]Sorry.
[269:00.38]Oh, we got debated again.
[269:01.60]Alright.
[269:02.34]Debated.
[269:04.33]They said that only twice?
[269:10.16]What is the color of Spyro's wings?
[269:12.92]B, purple, or C, orange?
[269:15.20]Everybody just follows each other.
[269:16.84]That motherfucker is purple.
[269:32.36]I've never played Spyro.
[269:34.84]I've never played Spyro the Dragon.
[269:37.48]I think he's voiced by Eliza Wood in the later ones.
[269:40.32]Is he?
[269:40.60]Yeah, I think it was Eliza Wood.
[270:00.59]I like his cameo in Spy Kids 3D.
[270:02.41]I would have got this one.
[270:03.47]I would have got that one.
[270:27.13]So what's the uh, what's this Lion King map?
[270:55.67]Yeah, it's Pride Rock.
[270:57.55]It's Pride Rock.
[270:58.43]I know this.
[270:59.41]The Savannah.
[271:00.03]Let's go.
[271:00.75]Lion King RP.
[271:02.35]I can finally go on off the farm.
[271:04.31]Oh, nice.
[271:04.99]Oh, yeah.
[271:05.39]Yeah, finally.
[271:06.17]I thought I'd finally be released.
[271:08.52]What?
[271:09.26]It's party time.
[271:14.34]We're going to Lion King land.
[271:17.12]Oh, no.
[271:17.54]No, not Pride Rock.
[271:19.40]Yeah, it's a good map.
[271:21.02]What's wrong with that?
[271:22.34]Pride Rock's dead.
[271:23.56]Last time we played Pride Rock.
[271:25.89]Every time we went to... I see... After this, I'm probably going to have to get out of the VR for a little bit.
[271:35.08]I'm getting fucking tired.
[271:36.04]Elder Scrolls V?
[271:50.91]My hair is insane right now.
[271:54.54]Oh yeah, after like the wrestling shit.
[271:58.04]I'm like, my soul is sapped from my body.
[272:12.70]Is this as big as it looks?
[272:15.08]It is pretty big, and if I remember right, there's different areas too.
[272:18.88]Really?
[272:23.12]It's not actually as big as it looks, but it's pretty big.
[272:27.58]Dude, it's open world.
[272:30.18]Oh, I didn't want to go here.
[272:45.52]I'm still Kane.
[272:55.37]Kane in the Lion King.
[272:58.67]Oh god.
[273:01.27]Oh god.
[273:06.20]Why are these in the game?
[273:08.58]Oops, what happened?
[273:09.44]What happened?
[273:12.26]I dropped, I dropped Simba.
[273:32.75]Alright, do the thing.
[273:33.53]Alright, I'll do the thing in a minute.
[273:39.49]I don't remember what the thing is, but we can't rule out dropkicking off the cliff.
[273:45.28]Okay.
[273:45.86]You go like that, right?
[273:47.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah, just do that.
[273:49.46]Oh, actually, we might be able to... You know what?
[273:55.97]I think there's something better for that.
[273:58.11]Where's Ace J?
[273:59.39]We'll get him into his little midfield and you can hold him up.
[274:03.77]So we don't need these is what you're saying?
[274:06.13]Yeah, you know what I mean.
[274:08.79]Okay.
[274:26.98]God damn it, man.
[274:29.10]I'm not ready for this.
[274:32.19]I'm too tired for this one.
[274:35.07]Ugh.
[274:39.39]This is kinda like fucked up shit everybody does in this game.
[274:42.43]Ugh.
[274:56.98]This is fucking too much.
[274:59.90]If you hold your arm out like a falcon cape, he'll climb up you.
[275:10.61]How's he gonna climb up on me?
[275:13.85]Where'd he go?
[275:14.87]Where'd he go?
[275:17.87]He vanished.
[275:20.35]I think he ran into a wall below.
[275:24.42]Kiss the ring.
[275:25.90]Kiss the ring.
[275:27.94]Wait, walk to the front here.
[275:29.14]Walk to the front.
[275:31.26]At the very edge.
[275:37.33]He's coming.
[275:38.47]What am I doing?
[275:39.45]Why am I doing this?
[275:41.51]He's already climbing you.
[275:42.47]You just don't realize it.
[275:43.41]He's already climbing you.
[275:44.53]He's already on you.
[275:46.61]What?
[275:46.79]He's already on your body.
[275:53.19]I need to run an errand, I'll be back.
[276:03.75]Run an errand?
[276:07.03]Wait, did you say that?
[276:30.30]Clear out some phlegm out of his throat.
[276:38.49]Jesus.
[276:39.15]Are you okay?
[276:42.03]You okay?
[276:43.95]Can we hold you?
[276:44.73]Like, there we go.
[276:45.73]There we go.
[276:46.33]Okay, I'm gonna turn you around.
[276:47.49]Turn you around like baby Simba.
[276:50.09]Where's he going?
[276:55.16]Okay.
[276:56.18]Uh-oh.
[276:58.48]I feel like I'm changing channels.
[277:07.91]Like, just channel surfing.
[277:09.91]Like, thousands of channels.
[277:11.53]I just saw, like, two TV shows, three TV shows at the same time.
[277:15.31]That's funny.
[277:16.99]And he's dead.
[277:17.69]There's too many television channels playing at the same time.
[277:21.35]There's, like, Mickey Mouse, there's Simba, there's Lion King, there's Heavy, there's TF2, there's Flying Rats.
[277:26.92]Um...
[277:29.80]Oh, there he goes.
[277:30.86]There he goes.
[277:31.80]Be free, Simba.
[277:32.72]Be free.
[277:34.76]Oh.
[277:38.99]I can't bounce.
[277:42.39]Meow-hoo.
[277:46.87]Found you.
[277:48.39]Come with me, little guy.
[277:49.59]Let's go.
[278:02.96]I'm just going in circles.
[278:05.68]Where?
[278:06.54]Where are you?
[278:12.30]I can't.
[278:12.62]It's like, that's the way my dog looks at me.
[278:17.31]Seriously, that's the way my dog looks at me right before he gets food.
[278:21.21]It's hard.
[278:27.90]Can we check out the other zones?
[278:33.30]What time is it?
[278:34.94]So if you come this way, the dotted line here... If you come this way and cross the dotted line, you'll get to the next zone.
[278:48.10]There's also a teleport, but you can just walk, too.
[278:51.30]Down here?
[278:52.20]Cool.
[278:52.84]Well, that looked interesting.
[279:04.54]There he goes.
[279:05.04]He's nesting.
[279:06.52]He's nesting.
[279:09.02]I don't know why you moved the arm.
[279:11.72]Oh, wait.
[279:13.12]Oh, you didn't have to.
[279:15.00]I know, but it's like my brain has to do it.
[279:19.27]Like in L.A.
[279:20.33]Noire, have you done the VR case files yet?
[279:22.55]No, no.
[279:23.05]I actually got to do them.
[279:27.01]What?
[279:28.01]Hold on, Jereva, can you hold your hand out for a minute?
[279:31.23]Just hold your hand out, kinda like before.
[279:34.77]Shit, I effed this up.
[279:36.20]Can you help me out?
[279:38.80]What?
[279:39.20]This is screwed up, y'all.
[279:40.90]I need some help.
[279:43.20]Careful!
[279:44.14]Oh, look!
[279:44.86]Somebody wanna pull me up!
[279:46.76]What the fuck is happening in my life?
[279:49.72]Man, shit's getting old.
[279:51.70]Help!
[279:52.76]I'll get him.
[279:53.68]Hit!
[279:54.21]God damn it.
[279:55.47]I knew I should've lost some weight.
[279:57.53]Get out from there.
[280:07.09]It's a great avatar.
[280:13.75]I can't, I have nothing to even say, that's unbelievable.
[280:16.63]What the fuck?
[280:21.87]That was un-fucking-believable.
[280:28.79]Why?
[280:29.21]That's Phil Margera!
[280:32.68]I know that, that's Bam Margera's dad!
[280:37.54]Why is that Avatar in the game?
[280:40.90]Why is that Avatar in the game?
[280:46.28]It's Phil Margera.
[281:06.84]It's like on the toilet?
[281:08.24]God!
[281:08.48]What is all the way down there?
[281:36.33]Just keep going and you'll find out.
[281:40.24]Wait, you gotta push your joystick further and further really fast.
[281:43.82]Just keep spamming it forward, but not super duper fast.
[281:47.70]Okay, hold on.
[281:49.98]It's a floor.
[281:51.85]Wait, there's a floor?
[281:53.65]It's a floor.
[281:54.75]It doesn't have a floor.
[281:56.63]Oh, alright.
[281:57.97]Let's see, there's a floor.
[282:01.54]So what's at the end?
[282:02.12]This music just doesn't fit for all the characters that are here.
[282:05.18]This is like a big MMO.
[282:10.88]I feel like we're going to fight a boss.
[282:12.66]Go do the boss fight?
[282:31.43]I don't know if it's working, the one... There's the... Yeah, but there's the old one of, um... Sword Art and Lion King.
[282:39.11]Yeah, I don't know if that one works, though.
[282:41.39]Or the Kingdom Hearts one.
[282:42.83]It's the way that this world looks.
[282:44.59]It just looks like, like, there's items over there, there's gonna be, like, some poles and shit.
[282:50.01]I gotta say, my favorite Lion King is two... Is it one and a half?
[282:55.34]I think, yeah, one and a half.
[282:56.86]There's a second Lion King?
[282:59.82]second it's a good one one and a half is my favorite you can't change that I know they made like four aladdin's that went right to them like bin is
[283:23.76]This really is just a safari.
[283:53.03]This is like... Oh, here we are.
[284:03.96]This is just a Disney walkthrough.
[284:06.16]This is a Disneyland Disney World.
[284:08.72]I feel like this is... Isn't this just the Kingdom Hearts level?
[284:12.06]Proper Disney maps, I think.
[284:15.10]It's insane.
[284:17.73]This is Hakuna Matata?
[284:22.62]We've seen the whole movie now.
[284:27.38]He's fucking T-posing.
[284:28.92]Right.
[284:29.82]Of course he is.
[284:38.27]Don't do it.
[284:38.89]God.
[284:47.65]Why is Simba wearing a helmet?
[284:49.60]Why is Nala?
[284:53.02]What did you do?
[284:53.82]Who did this?
[284:57.06]Monkey was here before anyone else.
[285:00.26]I feel like it was Monkey.
[285:01.58]I don't even know what that guy is.
[285:04.75]What is that character?
[285:08.87]Oh man, this brings back some memories.
[285:12.25]Sooner or later, you're gonna be able to experience the whole movie in the movie.
[285:37.82]You need to build a load of VR Lion King and just walk around in the whole room.
[285:45.87]Where's Josh at?
[285:49.17]Where is- Where's Josh?
[285:51.27]He's up in the sky.

[287:53.69]This has been going on for like five hours and my brain... I feel like I'm just the camera here.
[287:58.39]My blood is turning into plasma.

[289:34.45]Oh, this is fucking ridiculous.
[289:50.76]I'm just painting over here and you're just like, yep, I put it in.

[290:16.18]Now I am.
[290:17.34]Oh my god, now I- No, no.
[290:19.62]No!
[290:19.68]I actually didn't mean to pick this model.
[290:24.67]I'm sorry you had to see this.
[290:26.67]That'll make him sick.
[290:29.53]Take him to a Mickey Dally.
[290:38.43]That's a Mickey Mouse costume that you didn't inflate yet.
[290:41.45]I hope so.
[290:44.33]That's an inflatable Mickey Mouse costume.
[290:49.75]But it might not exist anymore.
[290:51.79]What is it?
[290:54.69]Oh.
[290:55.52]Micky's Alley.
[290:57.80]It's the worst plane that I ever filmed.

[291:07.60]That was just coming out.
[291:13.19]Oh god.

[292:03.77]Have you guys been to like any actually pretty maps today?
[292:08.65]Make sure you have the sound effect loud enough to hear the song.
[292:11.31]It's like the history of Disney, all in one place.
[292:13.96]Wow, it's my brother!
[292:30.60]And you gotta remember when you're going through all this, somebody took the time to find all these pictures and manually, like, placed them around this map.
[292:38.52]I don't know who called this.
[292:40.20]This is a good one.
[292:41.12]Look at that.
[292:41.94]Wow, that's beautiful.

[293:11.86]No, no.
[293:12.88]Should there be any TOS warnings before we explore?
[293:15.36]None of this is TOS violating.
[293:18.23]It's just weird.
[293:20.23]Disappointed.
[293:24.69]Oh, there's another one.
[293:26.49]Oh, my God.
[293:38.88]That's like if they made a Mortal Kombat version of Donald Duck.
[293:47.83]New Mortal Kombat 11 character.
[293:49.01]Um.
[294:06.57]There's more?
[294:07.45]I feel like we have to see the rest.
[294:11.65]These frames.
[294:12.43]Oh my god, these frames.
[294:14.04]They're like
[294:32.69]Yeah, if it's too bad, we can find another map.
[294:34.89]No, that'd be alright.
[294:36.67]Whoa.
[294:37.55]Monkey, that's fucking scary.
[294:40.05]Hi, welcome to Chili's.
[294:42.14]Welcome to the cult of Mickey.
[294:44.10]Oh!
[294:45.06]Oh, my God.
[294:46.80]Oh, my God.
[294:48.08]Oh, my God.
[294:49.04]Oh, my God.
[294:54.68]Oh, my God.
[295:01.99]Well, he's dead.
[295:05.98]What the fuck?
[295:07.70]That's so scary.
[295:11.08]What is this?
[295:11.92]Oh, yeah.
[295:14.76]They have the gas masks up ahead.
[295:16.62]Oh, that's weird.
[295:17.48]Oh, the floor's moving.
[295:20.09]What?
[295:20.45]You didn't see that?
[295:23.13]Oh, that's... What is that?
[295:27.45]Oh, the gas masks, yeah.
[295:28.59]The Mickey Mouse gas masks from World War II.
[295:31.74]Don't click me don't don't don't don't don't don't click it'll make you sick.
[295:36.46]Oh
[295:58.01]I mean, it looks... What?
[296:01.27]I can't hit... I'm broken.
[296:06.64]Oh no, no, no, what did you do?
[296:10.68]He looks like he's sucking himself.
[296:13.98]Oh no.
[296:14.82]That'll work on him, because he doesn't have full body, so... Looks fine on you.
[296:20.07]Fine being a relative.
[296:21.69]What do I look like?
[296:23.97]Do you have the camera?
[296:24.67]Which camera should I put?
[296:28.83]Uh, do the stream camera or the photo camera, either one, and then you can kind of, like, angle it up and see.
[296:36.02]Oh, he doesn't know.
[296:36.66]Yeah, you'd have to explain how the whole, like, reposition.
[296:39.22]You know what?
[296:39.62]Right now, just, you look good.
[296:41.60]We'll tell you that.
[296:42.20]What about my selfie cam?
[296:46.38]Grab it and, like, rotate it.
[296:48.68]Should be, like, a silver exterior.
[296:51.10]Should be able to just grab it.
[296:53.60]Oh, okay.
[296:54.02]Oh, you're taking photos.
[296:58.36]He just wanted to see what he looks like.
[296:59.66]You picked me because I was upside down.
[297:03.96]Oh.
[297:04.74]Oh, no.
[297:07.22]Yeah.
[297:08.86]Hey.
[297:11.64]That's how you do it.
[297:13.66]Oh, God.
[297:14.66]It's bacon.
[297:16.90]Alright.
[297:17.88]Perfect.
[297:18.88]How do I turn this off?
[297:22.48]I don't like this.
[297:25.20]You have to change your...
[297:29.25]I mean, yeah, the selfie cam got a lot of features, but it could be kind of... Hey, AceJay, does the seat work on that still?
[297:35.80]I can't seem to grab it.
[297:37.36]How do I... Open your menu, go to camera, and disable camera.
[297:43.23]There you go.
[297:44.33]Yeah.
[297:46.11]Don't go straight, take a left here.
[297:47.63]If you go straight, it's a trap.
[297:50.39]I'm Bigfoot.
[297:50.73]I'm the Sasquatch.
[297:51.57]What's going on?
[297:51.99]Bite him!
[297:52.25]Bite him!
[297:53.09]Bite him!
[297:53.71]Bite his head!
[297:54.49]Bite him!
[297:54.93]Dig in deep in his head!
[298:19.05]Get him off!
[298:19.77]Jockey's on me!
[298:20.67]Help!
[298:22.16]Jockey's on me!
[298:23.48]Jockey's on me!
[298:26.54]Get him off!
[298:28.78]Get him off!
[298:31.46]Get him off!
[298:35.53]Hey, Arnold!
[298:38.35]I'm stuck like this.
[298:39.45]I'm stuck with this life.
[298:41.45]Yeah, I don't know.
[298:42.43]Why is Arnold in here?
[298:44.04]It's pregnant Mickey.
[298:45.02]Broken Mickey models.
[298:49.22]I don't like this.
[298:49.88]I think the music stopped.
[298:52.87]I think we took too long getting through it.
[298:54.33]I'm trying to drink my tea and you're killing me.
[298:58.01]I'm sorry.
[299:15.75]Hey, you could get on my back if you needed a ride.
[299:19.63]You click up near his head, you should have a seat right around his back right here.
[299:24.50]Oh, Jesus.
[299:25.26]No, no, no.
[299:27.16]Oh, my God.
[299:28.78]I was going to throw up if I sit on there for more than 10 seconds.
[299:31.72]Oh, my God.
[299:35.00]I was attached to your head and moving around with your head.
[299:38.89]You got to jump away.
[299:41.29]I think that's bad.
[299:42.01]You should see the flying maps.
[299:43.63]What are you on now?
[299:47.95]You're covering my face!
[299:53.77]You're covering my face!
[299:54.92]I couldn't do it.
[299:55.88]It was like I was underwater.
[299:59.20]I just shook around.
[299:59.72]Oh no.
[300:15.44]Be careful.
[300:16.86]Don't fall.
[300:17.64]Somebody's a tree now.
[300:18.80]It's this corner!
[300:19.46]Is it wrong that I want it to be?
[300:21.16]What?
[300:21.60]How are you supposed to do this?
[300:45.66]I'm stuck.
[300:47.24]Am I stuck?
[300:48.82]What are you doing?
[300:50.06]What are you doing to me?
[301:15.74]I can't stop her.
[301:16.54]I'm gonna fall.
[301:18.52]This is awful.
[301:20.12]Nearly there.
[301:20.84]Come on.
[301:21.80]There we go.
[301:22.72]That's... That's... I feel like I just... I'm about to get birthed.
[301:32.20]We're like... We're traveling through.
[301:36.42]This is what it looks like when you're a baby and you're getting born.
[301:44.21]This is like Bloodborne level.
[301:45.73]It's like Hunter's Dream.
[301:54.26]Why am I holding my hands out?
[301:55.54]I'm holding them straight up for no reason.
[301:58.96]Oh no!
[301:59.32]I looked behind myself and I fell off!
[302:02.78]What?
[302:03.81]No, I looked behind my...
[302:11.95]Holy shit, that was scary.
[302:14.47]Yeah, just so you know, there's really nothing at the end worth seeing.
[302:19.64]It's just like a weird temple with nothing.
[302:22.66]We need everyone to respawn, though, because I don't want to go all the way back there.
[302:25.86]Throwing back into mob.
[302:29.18]Oh my god.
[302:32.09]Alright, I think I'm done.
[302:34.55]You're done?
[302:34.95]Alright.
[302:35.33]I think my brain, my brain.
[302:37.27]I'm going to fly up and try to see if I can get him to come back.
[302:43.37]oh my god what the fuck can you hear me okay wait what okay no oh I'm back hello we're back this is so yeah this is so this is so cool there wasn't much there
[303:07.34]Clubhouse I'm gonna make am I can't be in this for much longer.
[303:12.34]It's not a
[303:20.50]Oh, yeah, no, I wanna see that.
[303:21.26]I wanna see that, definitely.
[303:22.95]Oh, is it gonna be like a birth thing, like you were talking about?
[303:26.41]What?
[303:26.63]No, it's not a birth.
[303:27.93]Birth?
[303:28.89]A birth thing?
[303:29.61]Oh, no.
[303:29.93]No, I was saying like the way that...
[303:50.41]That was me.
[303:50.93]That was my fault.
[303:53.77]That was me.
[303:54.79]I said that.
[303:56.25]Okay, I thought that your head was the Mickey Mouse head for a second out of my peripheral.
[304:01.10]There was someone... Oh, shoot.
[304:07.09]Yeah, the frame rate's low because this map is just crazy, so... That's alright.
[304:11.17]Hunter's Dream.
[304:12.59]Alright, we'll wrap it up here.
[304:43.06]this has been wild though I've never seen anything like this before it's just it's it's like a hangout session but I you can just be anything
[305:11.37]It's Second Life, but more nuts.
[305:13.09]Well, think about, like, these are... I know you can make your own models in something like Second Life, but these are... They're incredibly detailed.
[305:22.37]They're like actually in-game avatars.
[305:24.20]It's ridiculous.
[305:25.54]Isn't Second Life a little limited with what you can actually make, or is it not?
[305:35.18]If you missed the Glue Man and the rats and the Jerm of pain, they were fantastic.
[305:45.91]I do want to see this though.
[305:47.49]Wow.
[305:48.07]Wow.
[306:09.18]I mean, I'm just going to tell you, I'm going to tell you right now, this Bloodborne is my favorite single.
[306:16.66]This is my favorite game ever made.
[306:20.68]This is like seriously hitting some buttons for me.
[306:22.86]This is hitting some buttons.
[306:25.10]Here, grab this.
[306:26.52]Take this from me.
[306:28.20]He's shitting me.
[306:33.47]That's so cool.
[306:36.16]They have pretty much everything every weapon from the game is around the magical no way Oh, yeah, you can even get the messages Oh
[307:04.74]It's in the wrong hand.
[307:05.52]I always liked the Moonlight Greatsword.
[307:07.44]I made a build just to use this thing.
[307:09.94]Yeah, I did too.
[307:12.25]Build Arcane.
[307:13.27]It's one of two weapons.
[307:15.89]I have the real one.
[307:19.21]Cheap invitation.
[307:20.97]Where are the other weapons?
[307:22.67]There's more weapons.
[307:23.29]Let me see.
[307:24.59]Yeah, there's a ton around the map.
[307:25.93]I don't know if there's any of this.
[307:26.96]There's a cannon over here.
[307:29.54]Can I try this one?
[307:30.96]The rifle spear?
[307:32.19]This makes me want to play the game.
[307:33.57]Yeah, let me see.
[307:34.29]Cool.
[307:34.59]Thank you.
[307:35.55]This is cool.
[307:42.74]Oops.
[307:43.02]I feel like I dropped it, but it was really awesome.
[307:46.24]Oh, shit.
[307:49.36]What just happened?
[307:50.06]If you reach down low enough, you can... Oh, that's the electricity.
[307:57.20]Make sure to stop.
[308:00.13]Place a chalice upon that altar and partake in holy communion.
[308:04.47]Look at this one.
[308:04.93]I have no idea if they're good or not.
[308:09.35]Yeah, that's the canon.
[308:17.41]Oh my god.
[308:19.35]This is amazing.
[308:27.09]Yeah, it's .
[308:31.45]Oh, where's the caravan?
[308:34.55]Is it over there?
[308:39.53]What does it say?
[308:45.40]One third to open the gate.
[308:46.74]Some of these maps have puzzles.
[308:53.62]I remember that thing.
[308:57.50]Oh, is it a puzzle?
[308:58.90]Did you ever play Bloodborne?
[309:00.16]Oh, no.
[309:01.47]No, I didn't have a PlayStation 4.
[309:04.19]And I'm not good at video games.
[309:06.25]Cursed the PlayStation for making me mad completely.
[309:11.28]Oh, fuck.
[309:11.84]There goes my lamp again.
[309:12.72]I watch the lore videos.
[309:16.70]That's the best game ever made?
[309:22.61]Oh, there's the doll.
[309:28.53]Why are there, like, 15 different Bob's Burgers?
[309:32.83]I'm sorry.
[309:34.33]There's so many.
[309:35.53]There's so many Bob Burgers.
[309:40.26]Is that Joker Bob Burger?
[309:42.24]Or is that Gumby Bob Burger?
[309:45.10]There's 20 of these, too.
[309:47.24]Oh, there's Garamond.
[309:49.44]You can talk to him.
[309:51.52]He's got, like, a menu.
[309:53.72]Oh, really?
[309:55.24]I don't know.
[309:56.11]Hey!
[309:56.82]Oh, you just shot him!
[310:00.48]What the fuck?
[310:02.26]Did you kill him?
[310:07.40]Oh, that stays.
[310:08.10]This is so awesome.
[310:15.20]What's this one?
[310:22.08]What?
[310:22.20]Oh!
[310:22.30]Oh, yeah, what's this thing?
[310:25.05]What?
[310:25.93]I don't think you can grab this.
[310:27.29]Oh.
[310:28.21]Just part of the bench.
[310:29.35]Don't aim that at me.
[310:30.71]That one's really cool.
[310:31.51]Wow.
[311:02.51]Oh, shit.
[311:08.37]Oh, that's the Carthus blade.
[311:14.13]No.
[311:15.87]No.
[311:16.45]Cainhurst.
[311:17.11]Cainhurst.
[311:17.67]Not Carthus.
[311:18.45]Cainhurst.
[311:19.05]Yeah, it's the Cainhurst.
[311:20.47]What is Carthus?
[311:23.89]This is from Dark Souls 3.
[311:25.11]Oh, right.
[311:25.73]Cainhurst.
[311:26.37]Right.
[311:26.57]They both do, like, bleeding stuff, so.
[311:30.41]I just wanted to spook you with it because I like the blade.
[311:32.56]It's one of my favorite ones.
[311:33.58]This carried me through my first playthrough of Bloodborne.
[311:35.92]Oh, you did Bloodtinge for your first build?
[311:38.12]That's ballsy.
[311:39.18]Yeah, that was a mistake.
[311:40.72]That was about 100 hours.
[311:41.96]That was like my first Dark Souls game, too.
[311:46.32]Oh, God.
[311:47.96]Wow.
[311:49.42]Yeah, doing like a Bloodtinge build.
[311:51.57]Your first ever Dark Souls, Souls-like kind of game.
[311:54.27]That's so cool, though.
[311:57.57]It's a cool fucking weapon.
[311:58.51]I don't regret it.
[311:59.29]No, it is.
[312:02.04]I remember that.
[312:02.60]That was the exploding thing.
[312:06.25]There should be like three umbilical cords around the map that let you go into the back to get one of them.
[312:11.41]Oh, really?
[312:11.95]And that's where I got the avatar.
[312:14.03]This is so cool.
[312:14.67]The one's in the house.
[312:19.81]It's up right here.
[312:24.64]Right here.

[313:05.72]Oh, there we go.
[313:06.76]I can't go through here.

[314:50.28]Alright, I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna stumble over here and fake my leave.
[315:02.17]This has been a lot of fun, though.
[315:15.92]Favorite the Avatar?
[315:16.90]Oh, that's a good idea.
[315:24.32]That's what's currently on me right now, right?

[316:10.17]Yeah, for sure.
[316:13.07]You've only scratched the surface, too, so... I can imagine.
[316:15.94]I can imagine there's probably a bunch of insane shit.
[316:20.68]Literally infinite.
[316:22.08]Where's Keevo?
[316:23.26]She's over there.
[316:24.02]I think she's over there.
[316:25.16]Wait, what?

[316:30.54]Yeah, I'll be like some, I'll be like a random person.
[316:33.71]I'm talking to you like, uh... Oh, the mouths.
[316:36.77]Oh, the mouths move.
[316:39.91]Okay, there we go.
[316:40.65]Hey, okay, so how are you?
[316:43.25]Uh, well, thanks for introducing me to everybody.
[316:46.13]It was, it was a lot of fun.
[316:47.15]Thank you so much.
[316:48.27]Yeah.
[316:49.36]It was fucking hilarious.
[316:50.16]Thanks for the, um, chaos.
[316:55.84]Very chaotic.
[316:56.50]Yeah.
[316:57.69]Controlled chaos.
[316:59.13]Controlled chaos.
[317:00.49]Oh, you drank a bottle of wine?
[317:05.07]I drank a bottle of wine like four days ago.
[317:08.33]I woke up at 12 p.m.
[317:10.40]and I have not eaten.
[317:11.80]And it's like 10.34.
[317:13.02]Eat a late dinner.
[317:13.90]Eat a Pop-Tart.
[317:14.82]But I'm going to take off.
[317:16.98]If you want to do more VR, bye.
[317:24.59]We'll see you again.
[317:25.71]Real soon.
[317:26.31]We were gonna do a mind show thing, but then this kind of... We got into this.
[317:35.08]This happened.
[317:36.20]This happened.
[317:37.30]This did.
[317:37.78]This did happen.
[317:39.72]Yeah, Beat Saber was awesome.
[317:43.18]Do more Beat Saber.
[317:45.53]Do more Beat Saber?
[317:46.69]I'm gonna get addicted to VR.
[317:51.16]I'm going to have to get the wireless.
[317:54.18]Welcome to the club.
[317:55.86]Welcome to the club.
[317:58.36]I'll see you guys later.
[317:59.32]Thank you, guys.
[318:02.39]Thanks for stopping by.
[318:04.21]Thank you, P.O.
[318:04.95]Thank you, Josh.
[318:05.51]How do I do that?
[318:12.14]Probably have like a million I would assume.
[318:14.54]Yeah, you might have a lot.
[318:17.68]Oh.
[318:18.36]Which in that case, you can scroll to the very end on the right.
[318:21.91]It's like in the social menu when you do your poll.
[318:24.09]Oh, OK.
[318:24.27]You can sort that out.
[318:25.55]Oh, OK.
[318:25.73]I see.
[318:26.01]I see.
[318:26.31]Alright, well.
[318:27.63]You can also do it from the website, I think, as well.
[318:30.03]That's cool.
[318:30.63]It just depends on how much you even want to play.
[318:33.17]Who made the avatars?
[318:36.13]Ace made pretty much all the ones that you saw.
[318:43.73]I don't know if he showed you the fireman.
[318:50.67]Wait, there's a fireman avatar?
[318:53.70]Yeah, just the emote walking around.
[318:55.52]Oh my god, can I see it?
[318:58.54]I don't think he's here anymore.
[318:59.58]Oh, he's not, okay.
[319:00.60]We'll save that for next time.
[319:04.94]Take care, guys.
[319:06.18]See y'all next time.
[319:08.50]Kiwo!
[319:13.71]Alright, I'm gonna unplug.
[319:16.55]I'm gonna do it.
[319:20.99]I'm gonna unplug.
[319:26.81]I'm talking this way the whole time.
[319:31.73]Oh, man.
[319:36.35]But, no, that was, um... I did not think that we were gonna be doing that for five and a half hours.
[319:44.33]But definitely give all those people a follow.
[319:47.71]All the help from Kiwo.
[319:50.78]Kiwo's awesome, streams all the time.
[319:53.38]Go follow Kiwo, she's great.
[319:56.10]VRJosh, thanks for all the help.
[319:58.22]Thanks for everything.
[320:01.94]Depope, Hj, like the avatars were fucking next level.
[320:05.30]I can't, it was amazing.
[320:07.52]So, I'm blown away by how fucking interesting and fun that was so.
[320:15.15]Gotta do it again.
[320:16.40]Yeah, I'm gonna take a break from VR, though.
[320:19.44]My last, like, five streams in a row have been VR.
[320:21.78]That's, like, taxing on me.
[320:28.36]But, uh, that is gonna be it.
[320:30.35]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[320:33.67]We're gonna take a break from VR.
[320:37.97]Try to get a, uh, a not virtual reality stream tomorrow.
[320:44.51]I'm not exactly sure what we're going to do.
[320:45.87]There's a couple of options, so we will figure that out tomorrow.
[320:50.85]Or I'll do it.
[320:51.89]I'll figure it out tonight.
[320:54.35]Hope you had fun.
[320:56.25]It was interesting, to say the least.
[321:00.06]If you've taken off, hopefully we see you soon.
[321:03.16]Thank you.
[321:09.92]Let's get out of here.
[321:11.26]I'll be right back.
[321:12.16]I'm going to just take a quick break.
[321:17.35]And when I come back, we'll do the bits.
[321:19.83]Just going to grab some water.
[321:20.59]That's it.
[321:21.83]I will be right back.
[321:22.89]See you in a minute.
[321:48.02]God bless you.
[322:22.43]you
[323:39.40]Thank you.
[324:18.90]That was just so all over the place.
[324:20.88]I don't even remember what happened.
[324:23.36]I have like bits and pieces.
[324:24.40]It really was a dream.
[324:26.05]You know, you just wake up and you go, oh, wait, wait, what the fuck was that?
[324:29.49]Oh, that happened, then that happened, and it starts to leave you.
[324:39.44]That was a lot of fun.
[324:40.02]Thanks for hanging out.
[324:40.68]Thanks, uh, for showing me all that stuff.
[324:44.76]VRJosh, thank you so much.
[324:48.77]I got a nice controlled, uh, tour of VRChat.
[324:55.16]Kiwa was watching the dinner clip.
[324:56.66]Oh, God.
[325:01.81]Yeah, we were gonna do a mind-show back-and-forth thing, because if you weren't here earlier, the... For some reason, we've been planning... Look, me and Kiwo have been talking about this for, like, at least a few weeks, right?
[325:17.28]And... Alright, let's go, let's do it on... Oh, yeah, Tuesday sounds good.
[325:21.48]Tuesday afternoon, yeah, Tuesday night, that sounds good.
[325:24.26]The day that... VRChat was, like, off.
[325:28.89]There was technical server problems earlier this afternoon.
[325:34.53]So we were kind of just like, oh, fuck, well now what the hell are we gonna do?
[325:37.94]So we were gonna do a mind show thing, and then... after, like, 30 or 40 minutes hanging out trying to figure out what the hell we were gonna do, it came back.
[325:47.66]So we just figured, alright, let's just do what we were planning on doing in the first place.
[325:52.15]But you probably will see that eventually.
[325:56.45]Q-R-S.
[326:02.96]But, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.
[326:04.42]Let's do the bits.
[326:06.64]VR is always a joy.
[326:08.20]I'm glad... I'm very happy that I could have the stamina to do it for more than five hours today.
[326:14.91]So that's good.
[326:17.77]And let's teleport ourselves back about six hours here.
[326:21.05]Five and a half hours or so.
[326:23.91]We had...
[326:27.22]Uh, back here.
[326:28.38]Guild Hero.
[326:30.60]Guild Hero gave a ton of community subs.
[326:34.46]Looks like 20.
[326:35.90]More than that.
[326:38.71]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[326:41.61]Yeah, these are the 20 community subs from Guild Hero.
[326:43.45]Thank you so much.
[326:44.01]That's a fucking shitload.
[326:45.53]Sorry I missed it.
[326:53.92]PMF.
[326:54.96]My pleasure.
[326:55.64]It was a lot of fun.
[326:59.94]And then Scripps3 gave $50.
[327:04.81]$50, 5,000 bits from Scripps3.
[327:08.59]Thank you.
[327:10.85]They say, hey Jerma, I've been a part of your community for a while on Discord, where I've been putting my writing and I was curious if you'd be interested in being hired to do an audiobook of my short story, The Skeleton Knight.
[327:24.70]It's a fantasy comedy short about an undead knight.
[327:29.88]Uh, here's the thing.
[327:30.94]I would say absolutely, but here's my problem.
[327:36.26]I'm like so hard to like get to do anything.
[327:42.15]I really don't want to be like, let's do it.
[327:44.03]Oh, yeah, let's go.
[327:46.55]And then I just like put it off and put it off and put it off.
[327:57.60]Do it in one stream.
[327:59.18]That might actually be kind of funny.
[328:03.96]What's the length?
[328:04.56]How long is it?
[328:06.38]What's the length on it?
[328:11.95]Because depending on how long something like that is, I really just don't have time.
[328:18.77]It's like 10 pages.
[328:19.75]That's not bad.
[328:33.08]Uh, hit, give me, do you, if you have like a link, hit up one of the mods and link one of the mods and then we'll, we'll go from there.
[328:46.29]But I cannot like guarantee that I will, because I just don't want to say, yeah, man, that sounds great.
[328:50.99]And I don't want to just put it off and not do it or something.
[328:53.11]You know, I want to obviously take that seriously if I say yes.
[329:03.65]Will I play Bloodborne?
[329:04.85]No, unfortunately not.
[329:06.15]Not on stream.
[329:10.21]Because I've just played through it so many times, I've done it at least four, three, four, five times.
[329:16.27]It would just be me showing you a game that you may have already played too.
[329:21.17]And we'll just kind of be sitting there going, hey, remember this part?
[329:24.01]I remember this part.
[329:25.31]Hey, watch this part.
[329:25.91]I guess maybe that's alright.
[329:32.76]Exactly.
[329:40.99]I want to see you nerd out.
[329:43.27]Maybe one day, when we got really nothing to do.
[329:47.03]If there's a lull in new games or things that I want to try to do, then maybe we'll just do it.
[329:54.93]Add it on the list, you know?
[330:00.31]A L-U-L in new one?
[330:03.53]L-U-L?
[330:04.17]What's L-U-L?
[330:06.33]Wait, why is everybody laughing?
[330:07.67]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[330:12.89]Okay, I get it.
[330:13.67]I was like, wait, what?
[330:16.73]Hey, thank you Sad Vega for the 250.
[330:18.16]Wow, an early stream.
[330:20.14]Glad to see this at work.
[330:21.94]Jeremiah, I have a friend whose internet is 0.8 megabits up and 8 megabits down.
[330:26.94]Their ISP promises 10 down and 3 up.
[330:29.24]What do you think they should do?
[330:33.25]Um, it really depends on the ISP.
[330:35.55]But ISPs, a lot of them suck.
[330:39.01]And have thousands of employees that all have to communicate with each other about what's wrong with your neighborhood's internet.
[330:47.82]So, I can't really give you any advice.
[330:51.92]The only advice you can give is just make sure that you at least get somewhat what you're paying for.
[331:00.53]Because if you're getting speeds that are like not even 10% of what you're paying for, then you need to call tech support and tell them like, hey, I'm not even getting 10% of what I pay for.
[331:12.23]Somebody's got to fix it.
[331:13.15]Because ISPs do have, you know, they have not like guarantees, but they, if you complain enough and you talk about it enough, somebody will come out there.
[331:29.33]know I mean I think look at look at the internet problems that I've had eventually somebody fix it somebody will come out and it will get done it'll get fixed but those speeds do not sound like what you should be getting but thank you to for real though 25 for the 250 they say watch this well let's see what watch what
[331:57.54]This is the scout voice actor guy.
[331:59.30]I think I've actually... Have I... No, I didn't see this one.
[332:05.32]It's not going to play through.
[332:06.14]Am I going to change my desktop?
[332:07.24]Let me see.
[332:17.05]It's playing through VR.
[332:18.55]Yeah, I'm going to put VR in a box for like a week or two.
[332:20.67]We will open that box again.
[332:30.50]Another time, right?
[332:31.96]And then this, change this to this.
[332:41.55]You should be able to hear this.
[332:43.51]I'm the scout, guys.
[332:44.75]And so obviously, I have to save the day.
[332:47.13]I save all kinds of people.
[332:48.31]I save little kids.
[332:49.49]I save kittens.
[332:51.41]I save coupons for buying discounts at the grocery store.
[332:56.50]But I also save presidents.
[332:58.38]And when I'm going to save a president, there's only one thing I need to say.
[333:02.18]One thing, baby.
[333:03.96]Mr. President, get down!
[333:05.46]You know?
[333:06.70]And I tackle him.
[333:08.14]Walking into the places, I see a bullet.
[333:10.71]It's coming for him.
[333:11.81]Mr. President, get down!
[333:13.83]What the fuck?
[333:14.73]I gotta save him.
[333:15.79]He's in big trouble.
[333:16.65]He's the president of the- What the fuck?
[333:22.19]What the fuck?
[333:29.38]Am I still in VRChat?
[333:30.86]I feel like I'm still there.
[333:40.82]Well, you can watch it.
[333:42.22]That was a snippet of Nate.
[333:44.96]It's Nate.
[333:47.22]That's the Scout voice actor.
[333:48.76]Hilarious dude.
[333:54.37]Coupons for the grocery store.
[334:04.19]But thank you, 4RealDope, for the $2.50.
[334:05.67]Yeah, that's Nate's Twitch channel as well.
[334:11.39]He'll give it a fall.
[334:14.70]StixRenegade, thanks for the $2.55.
[334:16.60]Jeremy, you should try Call of Juarez Gunslinger again.
[334:19.40]Didn't work for you last time, but maybe you can try again.
[334:22.22]Definitely the best Western shooter next to Red Dead's.
[334:26.26]The PlayStation 3 version, if you can sense the PC version failed on you last time.
[334:32.62]Yeah, I don't know.
[334:33.62]That was weird.
[334:35.34]I think that was actually on a different computer.
[334:38.85]I did try to play Call of Juarez.
[334:43.09]And it was just a frame-ready mess every time I tried to stream it.
[334:45.89]It was weird.
[334:48.47]Maybe I'll install it and just see if it opens.
[334:51.83]Please.
[334:53.11]I'm willing to give it a try.
[334:59.44]I'm willing to try it.
[335:03.30]Because I heard it was really fun.
[335:05.64]If you were at that stream, I was really disappointed.
[335:07.50]Because I really wanted to play it.
[335:11.95]Hey, actually, you know what, let's play.
[335:13.41]Fuck it, let's do it tomorrow.
[335:15.03]Should we just do that tomorrow?
[335:16.01]I was trying to figure out what I wanted to play tomorrow.
[335:19.71]Fuck it, let's do it tomorrow.
[335:21.45]Whatever.
[335:29.88]R.I.P.
[335:30.48]Dragon's Dogma.
[335:33.06]I better beat this one.
[335:38.41]Yeah, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.
[335:42.01]I hung the jacket up on this one for a little while.
[335:46.93]Because I think it's not the game that I initially thought it was.
[335:51.98]So a lot of people have been telling me, you might not really like streaming it.
[335:56.70]And I'm like, wait, what do you mean?
[335:57.66]And we've been talking about it.
[335:59.10]And I'm going to play the first hour or so just to see if it's something I think I'd want to stream.
[336:16.52]It looks like it's kind of 50-50 on whether or not I should play it or not.
[336:21.64]And look, it's not like, oh, what do you... I'm gonna make the final decision on it, right?
[336:27.19]But I'll just make sure that it's something that I want to do.
[336:33.59]So that's kind of the... I'm gonna... I gotta play that for like an hour to see if it's something I think I would have fun doing.
[336:42.67]It's a lot of talking.
[336:43.71]Yeah, it's also very long too.
[336:45.37]I thought it was just kind of like a 12, 8 to 12 hour experience where you like yell in a courtroom and like argue with people.
[336:51.65]But it's like a full-on like 40 to 50 hour investigative detective game, right?
[336:58.22]So I need to be prepared for that.
[337:00.10]And I need to know that it's something that I want to do.
[337:08.58]People said you'd hate disassembly too.
[337:10.24]I think you'll be fine.
[337:12.50]Yeah, but the thing about disassembly is each one of those things to take apart in disassembly is like 10 to 20 minutes.
[337:23.32]So it's not like, oh, just do one case and see how you feel.
[337:26.08]Isn't the first case like 10 hours or something really, really long?
[337:37.34]First case is 10 minutes.
[337:38.90]Really?
[337:39.93]That's like an hour or two.
[337:40.87]Oh, okay.
[337:43.65]We'll see, though.
[337:44.93]I'll give you an answer in the next... Because here's another thing that a lot of people, I want to make sure everyone's aware of, because I've been talking about it for a couple weeks, but I am going to be taking a bunch of time off next week.
[338:03.41]My mother, who I haven't seen in about seven months, is coming up to visit.
[338:10.19]So I'm gonna be spending time with her.
[338:14.82]And I know that one of my good friends came up like three weeks, four weeks ago, and I took a bunch of time off then too.
[338:21.86]It's just this people are coming up to visit in this kind of late spring.
[338:29.71]So, I'm going to be spending a lot of time with my mother.
[338:31.95]So, at this time next week, or a couple days before that, somewhere around, I'll give you a very clear indicator of when I'm going to be off, but I'm going to be taking at least four or five straight days off.
[338:50.32]Because I miss my mom.
[338:51.26]You know, I haven't seen her in a long time.
[338:54.13]She's got a lot of things that she wants to do every day.
[338:56.75]She wants to go do things and see things.
[339:00.70]So I'm gonna be taking a little, uh, like, vacation, I guess.
[339:03.98]A mom vacation.
[339:10.65]But, I, because of that, I'm probably gonna be streaming this week.
[339:17.07]Probably every day.
[339:20.37]So, today's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[339:22.74]Uh, I'll probably try to go as many as much as I can.
[339:33.50]Friday I mean I'm gonna try because I mean I'm gonna be taking like five straight days off better not get drunk I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get drunk don't worry I'll give you an indicator of what's going on this is gonna be at least three days in a row here at least and then Saturday like Sunday I don't know we'll have to find out
[340:00.48]I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen, but I'm going to try to go as much as I can before I take it off.
[340:06.42]Just to give you some more awareness, you know?
[340:12.16]But thank you to Atrolux, Atrox for the 250.
[340:15.99]Bonk, Jerm of Venus, thank you.
[340:22.52]Don't push yourself.
[340:23.32]Don't feel like you need to stream every day.
[340:25.32]No, I know.
[340:26.38]You guys know this as well as I do.
[340:29.09]If I'm not gonna stream, then I'll just change the sus, you know?
[340:33.01]I just won't do it.
[340:36.43]You guys know that.
[340:37.05]I'm not gonna, you know... There's no pressure here or anything.
[340:40.81]This channel's always been like that.
[340:43.75]So, no, it's all good.
[340:44.43]Don't worry.
[340:50.05]Sometimes the sus casts itself.
[340:55.42]Hey, Bake Me Home, thanks for $2.50.
[340:57.33]Thanks for the 200 bits.
[340:58.27]It was $2.50.
[340:59.37]What are you talking about?
[341:04.91]That was $2.50.
[341:05.91]That was $2.50.
[341:11.87]Thank you, Other Guy, for the $4.00.
[341:13.51]Jeremy, your streams never fail to make me laugh.
[341:14.93]I'm watching you when I really should be studying.
[341:17.07]But whatever.
[341:21.72]I clicked off the wrong thing there.
[341:24.92]Uh, thank you otherguy42.
[341:25.82]And there's... ...a video link here.
[341:39.40]What the hell?
[341:40.48]Ow!
[341:41.48]What?
[341:43.20]Why, why did somebody do that?
[341:48.10]What?
[341:49.10]That just like, just hurts!
[341:52.66]There's a guy jumping off of a bench and just landing on his stomach!
[342:01.28]Oh my god!
[342:07.93]Great video!
[342:14.01]Cho, here, look, if you really want to watch it, it's a guy just jumping off a fucking bench and getting hurt.
[342:25.36]It's just like he's in a suit.
[342:29.86]Why did you link me this video?
[342:34.58]There's just no context.
[342:35.42]He's just like, alright, I'm gonna do this.
[342:40.56]I don't know.
[342:41.04]I don't know why he did that.
[342:46.59]Agent 47.
[342:46.99]What?
[342:58.38]Yeah.
[343:03.10]It would take a lot of choreography though.
[343:07.82]Because there's no collision.
[343:11.97]VRChat is you just float around and unless you have the leg trackers, there's no...
[343:18.62]There's not a whole lot of... Okay, if I, like, throw a hand out and punch somebody in the face, they need to know that it's coming, and it's gonna be total acting.
[343:25.90]The whole thing has to be blocked out.
[343:28.56]It would be fun.
[343:33.73]Yeah, there's no pile drivers, no power bombs.
[343:37.39]You'd have a little bit of trouble even doing something from the top rope.
[343:41.49]Leg trackers exist.
[343:42.45]Yeah, you can just buy more lighthouses and stick them on your legs, right?
[343:45.46]That's how it works, I think.
[343:49.45]Hey Brolock, thanks for the five dollars.
[343:50.82]Here you go, mate.
[343:51.36]Just look at yourself from our perspective.
[343:53.00]Oh god.
[344:07.25]That's you guys looking at me.
[344:10.45]Looking at you.
[344:13.43]In VR.
[344:17.05]That's a full circle.
[344:17.97]It's kind of weird.
[344:24.14]But thank you, Broluck.
[344:25.35]Thank you, FrodeonWeapon for the 250 VRChat.
[344:27.45]Looks like a seriously fun time.
[344:30.55]Yeah, I had my doubts.
[344:33.25]When we were first talking about it and first loading in.
[344:37.70]That was a controlled environment, though.
[344:39.10]Because that was all of Kiwo, VRJosh.
[344:43.76]Like, they know people in the VR community.
[344:48.30]So that was kind of a lot of the people that they know.
[344:51.21]That wasn't just random lobbies.
[344:53.23]So...
[344:55.69]It was a little bit more controlled.
[344:56.82]I can imagine being in public would be a lot different.
[345:12.23]Public VR is hell.
[345:16.32]I figured for my first experience ever in it, I'd want to see what it has to offer before dunking my head in and just going into a public server with a hundred people in it.
[345:34.32]Yeah, I can imagine how it'd be hard to navigate.
[345:39.34]Still, it was still fun though.
[345:40.88]It was.
[345:41.14]Could end up doing like a viewer only server.
[345:46.75]Yeah, that would be alright.
[345:48.12]That would be fine.
[345:49.90]For the most part, you know, if something happened, if somebody was doing something bad or something, just, you know, kick them.
[346:02.39]Yeah, it was a fun time.
[346:07.71]And thank you SoupOrSeal for the 250.
[346:09.45]Just a reminder about the Joel Pogostuck challenge.
[346:13.09]That challenge is changing.
[346:15.41]Joel and I have talked.
[346:17.23]He got really busy, so we pushed it off.
[346:19.89]And we're going to do something else.
[346:21.73]A lot more elaborate.
[346:25.43]No more Pogostuck.
[346:27.81]Something better.
[346:28.69]Trust me when I say that.
[346:29.45]You're going to like it a lot better.
[346:33.30]Let's get the credits rolling too.
[346:34.88]Oh, we have a minute here.
[346:38.24]Credits, there they are.
[346:40.88]All the subs, new subs, old subs, all of you.
[346:43.52]Thank you guys.
[346:46.11]For another fun... VR stream.
[346:52.55]Let's put it in the box for a little while.
[346:54.31]Play some other games.
[346:56.11]Do some other things.
[346:59.95]I'll see you tomorrow.
[347:01.74]Maybe we'll just play Call of Juarez.
[347:03.96]Maybe we'll just do that.
[347:05.70]I'm just gonna download it and see if it works.
[347:17.13]Couple more bits came in.
[347:17.95]We had DoorCube.
[347:18.73]Thanks for 250, DoorCube.
[347:20.87]Are you going to show your mom VR?
[347:22.49]I don't think she could handle it.
[347:24.75]I really don't think so.
[347:28.19]That would be... No, she probably wouldn't want to go in it.
[347:34.38]She might want to watch me do it, but not actually do it herself.
[347:40.64]But, you know, it is what it is.
[347:43.90]Uh, thank you, Nickname.
[347:46.00]Nickname Jack for the 250.
[347:47.38]Skimming through this stream and seeing the highlights makes me sad I missed the stream.
[347:51.30]But goddamn, it was so funny.
[347:54.36]Thank you all.
[347:54.96]I'm... I kind of was just... I was kind of just involving myself a little, you know?
[348:03.81]Some of these guys are like VR veterans.
[348:05.75]I was trying just to hang.
[348:06.37]I was trying to hang, you know?
[348:07.24]I was trying to hang.
[348:11.32]It was a lot of fun.
[348:12.10]Glad you liked it.
[348:17.08]Yeah, VR veterans.
[348:19.46]VR vets.
[348:25.96]Is Kiwo still streaming?
[348:28.84]Is Kiwo streaming still?
[348:32.35]Let's have a look.
[348:35.97]She just... Okay, she just added.
[348:37.31]Because I know someone was saying that she was making a mind show clip or something.
[348:42.91]I was curious.
[348:59.39]She has the one with you in the mansion scene.
[349:01.83]Oh wait, did she add, she added herself into the family dinner singing thing?
[349:15.79]Do you feel like the obligation to be funny on VRChat is annoying?
[349:21.11]No, I mean, I, I was just kind of just doing whatever.
[349:28.87]I don't think that had any obligation to do anything, you know?
[349:36.01]It was not the ABC one.
[349:37.43]Oh, thank God.
[349:40.79]I think when you just actually walk around and you have like a... a bar and a few people that are just in character, it's fun just to kind of... be insane for a little while, you know?
[350:08.24]Just five hours.
[350:09.02]Well, all of that wasn't, you know, making jokes and being, like, in character.
[350:14.87]I would say probably two-thirds of this stream was me just, like, staring, going, What is that?
[350:20.15]What is happening?
[350:26.87]You know, so it was a lot of me just taking it in, and then some, obviously, just improv bits that just kind of came up for no reason.
[350:42.33]But I don't find it to be, like, an annoying thing.
[350:45.03]I think it's fun.
[350:55.15]Coach hanging off your arm is amazing.
[350:59.66]It's hard to take it in sometimes because it's just so out of control.
[351:03.38]And then you're like, hold on, let me, like, I want to add something to this, right?
[351:06.74]Plus, I was a glue man.
[351:08.00]I got to be glue man.
[351:10.42]I had to do it.
[351:19.49]Wait, here's the keyword clip.
[351:21.17]Whatever.
[351:24.77]Let's see.
[351:25.29]Let's watch it.
[351:25.77]Browser... Let's add it.
[351:32.41]Let's take a look.
[351:33.07]I think this is when we were doing a test.
[351:34.53]We were testing to see if this was going to work earlier, before the stream started.
[351:37.49]Yeah, whatever.
[351:39.89]Whatever.
[351:43.24]You finally made it.
[351:44.08]Yeah.
[351:46.24]Welcome.
[351:48.15]I'm glad you finally accepted my messages, my calls.
[351:51.45]I wanted to invite you here today, and it's so good to see you.
[351:55.87]Are you alright?
[351:56.59]You okay settling in?
[351:58.01]Yes?
[352:01.47]Welcome.
[352:02.43]Welcome to my manor, my virtual playground.
[352:06.21]You're gonna get in a lot of trouble with that concrete.
[352:18.41]I was saying like I fell down on her house, on her front steps.
[352:22.96]And she was gonna get a concrete lawsuit because I fell down.
[352:27.22]VR face palming.
[352:35.30]It's all fun though, you know.
[352:45.17]But that's gonna be my time.
[352:47.39]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[352:55.79]Try to enter the Gungeon.
[352:58.54]Not right now.
[352:59.42]Not right now.
[353:00.68]Maybe eventually.
[353:01.92]Soon.
[353:03.20]Maybe.
[353:06.20]But... See you tomorrow, guys.
[353:10.10]Not going to be starting at like 2 o'clock Pacific tomorrow.
[353:15.71]Going to be starting at...
[353:18.63]This normal between like three and four.
[353:23.14]See you soon.
[353:24.64]Take care.
[353:27.04]Have a great rest of your night.
[353:29.22]Stream legends.
[353:30.68]Yep.
[353:31.42]Thanks for the reminder.
[353:33.14]Let's activate it right now.
[353:47.08]There you go.
[353:47.78]Three, two, one.
[353:50.76]There you go.
[353:51.48]Alright.
[353:51.86]Awesome.
[353:53.48]See you guys soon.
[353:55.13]Take care.
[353:55.91]Have a good one.
[354:21.87]you
