[00:19.43]How's it going?
[00:22.11]Welcome.
[00:24.03]Welcome back.
[00:26.68]He's already telling us to relax.
[00:29.30]A mod will make it funny in a few minutes.
[00:32.28]Well, here's the thing.
[00:35.26]You tell me.
[00:36.48]I have a question for you.
[00:38.16]So, a title.
[00:40.50]The title of this stream.
[00:43.57]A lot of people will say, okay, the game we're playing is The Last Hero of Nostalgia.
[00:49.41]It's like a comedy, parody, Dark Souls game.
[00:52.67]It looks like something I wanted to play for a while.
[00:55.03]The problem is, I don't know what's in this game, right?
[00:58.89]How do you title something that you don't know?
[01:01.61]I can't make a reference to this game.
[01:03.49]I don't know what's in it.
[01:04.83]So how do you title that?
[01:06.04]We need to wait.
[01:08.02]We should take a system on this channel of soft titles.
[01:14.67]Because after about 30 minutes, you know that some monster's gonna show up and everyone's gonna give it a name.
[01:19.53]And the title's gonna be, like, Gunu's Revenge.
[01:22.53]You understand?
[01:23.89]It's a soft title.
[01:27.07]Anyways, how you doing?
[01:30.04]Hope you're doing well.
[01:32.68]Gonna just play a game today.
[01:34.08]I can tell you the plan.
[01:35.12]Uh, that is, uh... I haven't told you yet.
[01:40.31]So today we're gonna play this.
[01:41.15]Just gonna chill out.
[01:41.95]Play it until it's... And look, if I don't like it, then I'll play something else.
[01:49.49]Maybe jump around to a few games.
[01:50.79]Maybe I really like this.
[01:53.19]Looks really cool.
[01:53.96]Looks really interesting.
[01:56.91]A soft Gunu stream.
[02:01.54]But, so this is, we're doing this tonight.
[02:04.62]Tomorrow night, tomorrow night, I have a sponsor stream.
[02:09.44]I haven't seen one of those in a while.
[02:11.16]It's been a few months.
[02:13.38]And that sponsor stream is going to be to play Wild Hearts.
[02:20.01]Those of you that have seen Wild Hearts, it looks like it's pretty fun.
[02:22.55]I'm going to be sponsored to play it.
[02:25.25]I'll be playing tomorrow with Vinny.
[02:27.88]That's the plan.
[02:29.54]We're trying to figure it out.
[02:31.44]It's possible.
[02:33.68]Set in stone, kind of.
[02:37.31]But I will be sponsored to play it.
[02:43.99]If you don't know what it is, it's kind of in that... It's like Monster Hunter.
[02:48.32]It's in that Monster Hunter world.
[02:49.94]But I believe there's changes.
[02:52.86]There are some pretty interesting changes to that sort of monster hunting game.
[02:56.86]We'll check it out.
[02:58.18]We'll see.
[03:02.22]It seems like people think it's good.
[03:04.58]So I'm really, really interested and really happy to play it.
[03:12.35]What about Elden Ring?
[03:13.53]Well... Forrester.
[03:20.66]Forrester.
[03:22.70]Yeah, he hit me up.
[03:23.60]He's like, hey, you have an interest to keep going?
[03:25.12]And I'm like, nah.
[03:28.68]It was fun, but nah.
[03:30.98]I feel bad.
[03:39.77]Why, you rude?
[03:43.00]No, no, we had a... Look, we were very, very clear about how we felt about everything.
[03:47.59]So don't worry.
[03:57.06]He fucking hated it.
[03:59.24]I didn't hate it.
[04:00.06]I just... I don't know.
[04:05.54]You know, the vibes were off.
[04:06.68]And we knew that.
[04:12.77]Look, I like hanging out with Stir.
[04:15.93]Okay?
[04:16.17]Doesn't matter what the game is.
[04:19.97]We'll do something else.
[04:20.89]Don't worry.
[04:22.25]We even started talking about what the new thing could be.
[04:26.87]Did we or did I make that up?
[04:29.46]I don't know.
[04:29.94]Just in case somebody asks them.
[04:33.58]I made it up.
[04:40.64]I made it up.
[04:42.42]No, no, no, no.
[04:43.10]No, I didn't.
[04:43.62]No, I didn't.
[04:46.23]No, I didn't.
[04:46.71]Okay.
[04:47.15]Yeah.
[04:48.15]It was like, oh, we'll do something else at some point.
[04:49.65]Yeah.
[04:51.67]Yeah, yeah.
[04:52.39]It's all good.
[04:58.62]Anyways.
[05:02.18]You're a liar.
[05:05.38]Let's go.
[05:06.42]This is Last Hero of Nostalgia.
[05:08.06]Nostalgia.
[05:10.13]And this could be exciting.
[05:12.83]Just going to chill out, play a game.
[05:15.08]You know how it is.
[05:17.06]Let's go.
[05:20.12]Last Hero of Nostalgia.
[05:23.34]So I don't, I mean, this game is kind of looks like a Souls game, but it's not.
[05:28.61]I think it's like a comedy game.
[05:30.37]It might be multiple genres.
[05:33.61]I have no idea.
[05:35.93]But I wonder, is this a controller game?
[05:37.43]It might be.
[05:40.96]Yeah, I'm going in without any knowledge about anything.
[05:45.43]Okay, make sure I... Okay, I gotta get that off the screen.
[05:48.13]Alright, brightness... Just set this low, great hero.
[05:50.57]You need not see the corpses.
[05:55.55]I mean, I have to play games like this.
[05:56.67]Otherwise, I can't see anything.
[05:59.17]I know that it's intended for you to play stuff down here.
[06:02.53]But I'm sorry.
[06:04.29]I know that lots of games that do this... It has to be up a little bit.
[06:07.95]Otherwise, I physically can't see.
[06:14.49]How about like right here?
[06:15.35]Is that right?
[06:15.73]Yeah.
[06:18.25]This will help you understand the game a bit and will help you find the fun.
[06:22.23]Yeah, why not?
[06:23.37]Let's do a tutorial.
[06:25.23]Okay, that's the question I just asked that.
[06:29.42]Character customization.
[06:30.44]Please use your keyboard to enter a name.
[06:32.46]Okay.
[06:37.04]This is my character.
[06:42.95]Um...
[06:47.85]Oh, I think this is the point.
[06:54.43]It's not doing anything.
[06:58.49]Max it, coward.
[07:04.26]I just did.
[07:17.78]How about tattoos, a couple of accessories?
[07:21.10]Um, I don't know.
[07:22.28]Like here?
[07:27.01]Alright.
[07:28.23]Everything at zero besides endowment?
[07:36.05]Alright, that looks good.
[07:36.75]How about, uh... How about, uh...
[07:48.19]I'm so bad at making names now.
[07:52.03]I used to be so good at this.
[07:54.37]But now, I feel like I've diluted the... I've diluted it too much.
[07:59.46]I've made up too many names in my life.
[08:02.86]Where now, I'm just sitting here going like, I don't know, Fred1?
[08:05.74]Gunu.
[08:06.04]How about, um...
[08:17.42]No, we have to... Guna was a different character.
[08:19.26]How about, uh... Slightly... Slightly... Like, slightly sharp.
[08:38.24]Extremely sharp.
[08:41.49]Moderately.
[08:42.03]Well, now I'm just naming cheeses.
[08:44.29]That's like a cheddar cheese scale.
[08:51.71]Minced meat.
[08:57.20]Minced meat?
[08:58.66]Minced meat?
[08:59.26]Is it minced meat or is it mince meat?
[09:01.56]Minced meat.
[09:07.28]Ah, minced meat.
[09:12.05]I like it.
[09:15.07]I think that looks good.
[09:17.01]Anybody have any complaints?
[09:24.33]Minced meat.
[09:28.22]Glass.
[09:28.76]Alright, this is important.
[09:31.16]Data DIN?
[09:33.58]I feel like this is like the subject line of a company email at a tech company.
[09:54.34]Please don't say this stuff.
[09:55.68]Don't call us this.
[09:59.06]Alright, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[10:00.82]Brutal Saboteur wields heavy weapons.
[10:02.86]Favors strength.
[10:05.77]A noble and stalwart defender of order.
[10:07.63]Favors vitality.
[10:08.63]Champions of fidelity.
[10:10.89]They are well-rounded and versatile.
[10:12.31]Okay, cool.
[10:18.63]Dexterity?
[10:19.31]I can't pick this.
[10:22.64]I can't play the... I'm not going to play the joke character right now.
[10:25.74]Should I... I don't know.
[10:26.38]I feel like I'm going to get my ass kicked.
[10:29.38]Four strength?
[10:29.72]Okay.
[10:52.49]Just do it.
[10:53.75]It's a joke game.
[10:54.71]You're gonna be fine.
[10:55.81]It's a joke game.
[10:56.63]You're fine.
[10:58.31]Okay.
[11:00.71]It's assassin slash rogue.
[11:02.37]It's not a joke.
[11:03.69]Oh.
[11:07.88]I kind of just want a shitload of health.
[11:13.86]I think I just want a bunch of health.
[11:15.90]It's boring, but whatever.
[11:18.82]You are a joke.
[11:21.36]Shut up.
[11:26.89]Okay.
[11:27.29]All right, fine.
[11:27.92]I'll try it.
[11:28.40]I'll try it.
[11:28.82]I'll try it.
[11:29.16]I'll try it.
[11:29.60]So this is like parries and backstabs.
[11:31.92]You're going to get me killed.
[11:32.80]Whatever.
[11:33.12]All right, let's go.
[11:41.57]Yes, indeed.
[11:43.01]Voice acted.
[11:45.07]It is called Nostra Gaia, where the wait, wait, cut, cut, cut.
[11:51.23]Was that your customization screen?
[11:54.61]Oh, mighty save me.
[11:58.25]I don't know what you are, but you're no hero.
[12:02.13]So I'm not playing the intro.
[12:07.60]Well, just get good at parrying.
[12:19.56]Cool.
[12:21.64]Cool.
[12:24.90]Cool.
[12:25.04]How do I move?
[12:28.54]Okay.
[12:32.36]So there's a dodge roll.
[12:49.96]Actually feels pretty good.
[12:53.63]Stamina bar.
[12:57.09]Anything else I need to know?
[12:57.95]That's all.
[12:58.33]Hey, that's it.
[12:59.37]Just literally give me a dodge roll with iframes and give me a light and heavy attack and I will beat your game.
[13:03.70]I promise you.
[13:04.36]Okay.
[13:13.14]The welcome host was absent.
[13:16.02]No one to tell the newest spawn what to do or what it was.
[13:23.37]E. Okay.
[13:29.21]Oh, here's the messages on the ground.
[13:30.63]Yep.
[13:34.79]Okay.
[13:35.19]Wait, left bumper is shield.
[13:36.49]Uh-huh.
[13:37.41]Yep.
[13:39.64]You are not alone.
[13:40.38]We have walked before you.
[13:43.32]Go back to where you came from.
[13:45.72]Hero over.
[13:48.51]Oh, hero lover?
[13:49.93]Lock on.
[14:06.19]Use your heroic icon and heal.
[14:08.55]Oh, I have three.
[14:09.27]All right.
[14:09.51]How does this work?
[14:10.25]Okay.
[14:11.63]Is there iframes?
[14:13.89]I think there is.
[14:14.35]There is.
[14:15.72]Okay, cool.
[14:21.30]Do you get experience?
[14:26.18]Starts with three uses.
[14:27.00]It'll be replenished when you get to the next checkpoint.
[14:29.42]Okay.
[14:30.12]Use it carefully.
[14:34.31]How long does it take?
[14:36.49]Oh, that takes a little while.
[14:45.30]If Stirrer looks over at this stream, he's going to think I'm playing modded Eldritch Ring.
[14:50.82]He's going to be like, what the fuck is this?
[14:53.92]Where were these cool mods?
[14:58.17]Switch stances.
[14:59.57]Okay, two hands.
[15:05.54]Green herb.
[15:07.48]You just picked up an item.
[15:09.08]Check your inventory to see it.
[15:10.04]Okay, it looks like it is just like a FromSoftware game.
[15:15.98]Toggle item description.
[15:19.53]So there's a consumable heal.
[15:21.81]What is all this?
[15:35.88]That was a crit.
[15:40.12]Okay, how many hits can I take?
[15:44.41]Dude, look at these cool mods, man.
[15:53.05]Access, access, access.
[15:59.82]They probably have bosses, too.
[16:01.26]There's a backstab.
[16:02.00]Otherwise, this character would be fucking stupid.
[16:07.42]What does this mean?
[16:07.94]Alright, I'm gonna die.
[16:08.46]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[16:36.93]You're supposed to lose during the tutorial.
[16:43.32]It's like every game that's ever come out that's in the same genre.
[16:47.08]You die, and you wake up, and it's like... It's like, see?
[16:52.94]Death is not the end.
[16:54.72]And then you go back, and I'm going to come back here with like three... Okay, I died.
[16:57.32]I saw that scripted death.
[16:58.62]Okay.
[17:06.97]Pretty good.
[17:08.19]So now what happens?
[17:08.97]Let's see.
[17:10.05]There we go.
[17:11.15]Okay, so you're... So I died.
[17:20.45]Alright, I'm dead.
[17:25.16]I thought I was going to do the thing that they all do.
[17:30.12]Does everything respawn?
[17:32.46]Everything does respawn.
[17:33.38]Alright.
[17:34.14]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[17:41.05]about parries okay that is a parry try do I dare attempt to try to figure out the parry system in this game let's see all right that's not bad it's pretty good it's actually pretty forgiving
[18:10.78]But here's the big question.
[18:12.86]Can you parry on stairs?
[18:16.31]It's way better than Elden Ring.
[18:17.97]Way better.
[18:18.39]Actually, it does feel fun to play, though.
[18:33.07]I'm interested.
[18:36.40]Just don't die in the tutorial again.
[18:43.94]Oh, come on.
[18:44.48]I didn't... Be invincible during this?
[18:51.34]Yep.
[18:56.48]Ooh, what is that?
[19:02.14]Reclaim memory.
[19:04.36]Memory restored.
[19:07.52]Oh!
[19:08.06]That's my souls.
[19:09.70]Whatever.
[19:10.00]I call it whatever I want.
[19:20.22]Okay.
[19:21.46]We're good.
[19:23.36]There's probably secrets and stuff, but whatever.
[19:24.88]There we go.
[19:39.69]I like this game.
[19:45.96]This is a Picross-like?
[19:47.68]Um, yeah, I can see where you're coming from.
[19:57.06]It's like granny-like.
[19:57.90]Oh, yes.
[19:59.42]Oh, fuck.
[20:00.51]Don't be an idiot here.
[20:03.25]Okay.
[20:03.81]If I die here, I'm going to be actually pissed off.
[20:09.93]Oh, yes.
[20:29.58]It's a Bugleberry-like.
[20:31.03]Yeah, that's cool.
[20:35.43]Alright, but wait a minute.
[20:37.53]What's over here?
[20:38.65]Is there a sprint?
[20:41.08]I just accidentally took the last heal.
[20:42.88]That's very... I'm happy about that.
[20:45.12]That's great.
[20:58.29]What is he hitting me with?
[20:59.09]What's he hitting me with?
[20:59.93]What was that?
[21:00.61]All right, we're good.
[21:24.18]That was a really good play.
[21:26.76]I made sure to get the parry to get the iframes to get the kill and be invincible.
[21:32.28]That was not a bad play.
[21:34.38]That's years of experience right there.
[21:37.59]And I know for a fact that some of you are going to say true.
[21:39.79]Because it is.
[21:41.47]That kind of experience with Souls games is why I just did not die.
[21:56.95]That's fine.
[21:57.31]You can troll me all you want, but that's true.
[22:00.27]Knowing how to perfectly pixel perfect play that was only because of how many times I've played Souls games.
[22:11.44]What?
[22:11.74]Oh, everything is becoming retro.
[22:32.40]Wait, is this a... Okay, I'm starting to get it.
[22:34.39]Is an item back here?
[22:48.39]Where was it?
[22:50.19]You saw it, right?
[22:51.47]Where was it?
[22:57.23]Did I... Am I losing my mind?
[23:05.25]It was like glowing on a pedestal.
[23:06.59]What was it?
[23:06.99]Am I seeing things?
[23:15.48]No, it is right there.
[23:16.22]How do I get over there?
[23:16.84]Okay.
[23:28.02]Uh-huh.
[23:29.54]Yep.
[23:32.80]148.
[23:32.82]7 momentum.
[23:35.67]Special abilities.
[23:36.61]I mean, this thing is... This thing's better.
[23:39.87]Alright, yeah.
[23:51.37]How do I get over there?
[23:51.96]Elugiary books?
[23:53.54]Elugiary bookcase?
[23:56.84]Elugiary bookcase?
[24:06.77]Take that herb.
[24:07.85]Good call.
[24:15.09]Hmm.
[24:15.34]I don't want to miss the first secret of the game.
[24:18.38]I don't get it.
[24:29.88]How do I do it?
[24:30.28]I don't think there's no jump.
[24:39.64]Why is there no face cam on?
[24:41.04]Because I don't feel like having it on.
[24:43.32]That's it.
[24:46.42]End of discussion.
[24:55.85]I don't think I can get in there.
[24:56.63]Oh, giga chat.
[25:06.37]I'm going to miss the first secret of the game and everyone's going to make fun of me.
[25:11.66]Oh, well.
[25:13.12]I'm going to go through here, though.
[25:22.38]Turn back.
[25:32.31]Maybe I should.
[25:37.00]Whoa!
[25:38.88]Everything's fine.
[25:43.60]What is that?
[25:44.66]Jesus.
[25:55.92]Oh, fuck.
[25:56.56]That hurt a lot, guys.
[25:57.98]That hurt a lot, man.
[26:06.61]God damn it.
[26:08.13]Oh, I didn't have enough stamina to swing again.
[26:10.03]Oh, shit.
[26:12.07]That's not good.
[26:19.26]Oh no, he's still in the tutorial.
[26:25.24]Oh shit.
[26:26.70]He is actually still in the tutorial.
[26:30.77]He's still in the tutorial.
[26:34.93]Judging by the four reactions to why there's no face cam, there was GigaChad, bald, naked, or pregnant.
[26:41.65]Oh, okay.
[26:47.90]No, actually...
[26:50.01]Back a year ago, I never had face cam on.
[26:53.33]That was a new thing.
[26:54.39]I would put it on for like horror games.
[26:58.09]It was pretty rare.
[26:58.65]And I don't know, I kind of like it like this.
[27:05.83]It'll come on.
[27:06.71]You're never going to not see my face again.
[27:08.75]Don't worry.
[27:10.35]Just like when I want to.
[27:11.19]And that's it.
[27:14.30]A year ago?
[27:14.97]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:17.01]Not... Alright, I gotta... I mean face cam, not... Now you're getting me killed.
[27:29.67]Don't ever show your face again.
[27:41.88]looking way different you know that's actually kind of funny that's I'm gonna do that like I hope you understand that this is not some long elaborate bit to turn my face cam on in like three months and be like I don't like a fat guy or something but but you know what I mean like it's what if I had like a fucking different haircut I had like different facial hair I don't know it might be kind of funny oh stir raid from stir
[28:11.99]What's going on, stir?
[28:14.97]Hope you're having fun in Elden Ring.
[28:16.83]I am playing a different game that looks kind of like modded Elden Ring, doesn't it?
[28:22.46]See, I decided that, like, oh, no, dude, I'm not, like, into playing, like, the modded stuff anymore.
[28:27.66]I'm gonna play a video game whose sole purpose is to be a modded Elden Ring.
[28:32.22]You know, it's like, you know, but you know how it is.
[28:41.69]Nah, thanks for the raid.
[28:44.01]Hope you're doing good.
[28:44.87]Hope all the stir watchers are doing good.
[28:48.07]Alright, this time I'm not going to mess it up.
[28:56.46]I have enough health.
[28:57.40]I'm going to kill this mini boss.
[29:09.06]That's mean to the devs of this game.
[29:12.55]What?
[29:12.91]No, no, no.
[29:13.65]I mean, this game is very clearly supposed to be a Dark Souls parody.
[29:18.24]That's the whole point of this game is a Dark Souls parody.
[29:26.22]It's very good.
[29:27.10]Hey, when did I say this wasn't fun?
[29:31.82]In fact, I'm going to tell you right now, of all the Souls likes I have played, the parody one seems to have the best first 45 minutes.
[29:40.22]I'm just saying.
[29:47.83]Ooh.
[29:56.22]There's more over here.
[29:58.22]Aww.
[29:59.48]You've played, like, 15 minutes.
[30:01.13]Yeah, and I'm having a fun time.
[30:02.65]Well, the merits of this game are not solely to be held of it being a parody of Dark Souls.
[30:10.01]No.
[30:10.63]That's absolutely accurate.
[30:13.12]But...
[30:14.87]It's definitely initial intent is to get you to say, well, this is kind of like a Dark Souls parody.
[30:20.94]Doesn't mean that it's all about that.
[30:25.80]Ooh, that was cool.
[30:36.41]Was that armor?
[30:38.57]I don't know what that was.
[30:44.03]It is.
[30:48.79]All right, this game is way cooler than I think any of you thought it was going to be.
[30:55.13]Is that all I have?
[30:58.37]Cool, OK.
[30:58.97]All right, well, I got that.
[31:11.52]Were there any properties on this?
[31:13.70]Just physical defense.
[31:16.50]Oh, here's lore.
[31:19.95]pixelating chest piece with a target painted where the heart would lie after I was splintered as so often as I was I would be taken back to the repair shop and restrung for the next encounter okay I can't there's a memory in this thing okay I think this is sprint button right it has to be what is it
[32:01.53]Don't even do it.
[32:02.07]Oh my goodness.
[32:08.17]Okay.
[32:09.95]I wonder if you need to break any boxes for any reason.
[32:14.82]This happened to my buddy Eric.
[32:17.18]That's kind of crazy.
[32:18.02]It seems like Eric's... A lot of stuff's happening to Eric lately.
[32:23.89]It's kind of weird because it seems like five to ten thousand of you have this friend of yours named Eric.
[32:30.67]It seems to do a lot of crazy shit.
[32:33.68]That's kind of cool.
[32:34.28]All right.
[32:34.54]I'm not going to fucking lose again.
[32:43.14]The narrator decided to make some story edits.
[32:51.62]Don't talk about Eric.
[32:52.46]You don't even know him.
[32:55.90]I can't make references to Eric because he's not my friend.
[32:59.82]Oh, I see.
[33:01.64]Dude, you don't know Eric.
[33:03.14]Like, why are you talking about him?
[33:04.84]I know Eric.
[33:05.38]You don't.
[33:06.08]Stop bringing him up.
[33:07.76]Alright, that's true.
[33:09.03]I don't know Eric.
[33:09.89]You do.
[33:10.07]What?
[33:11.05]Ooh, this is better, isn't it?
[33:13.09]Is this better for me?
[33:26.42]I'm supposed to use daggers.
[33:31.04]I'm going to stick with that.
[33:38.08]Fuck.
[33:44.81]No, please.
[33:45.67]Not in the tutorial.
[33:46.63]Not in the tutorial again.
[33:47.71]How do I sprint?
[33:56.37]Okay.
[34:00.45]We're good.
[34:05.49]Hold control.
[34:06.33]Ooh.
[34:10.48]The spell will consume access when you use it.
[34:15.20]Access.
[34:15.68]119 damage.
[34:24.83]And uses access.
[34:30.91]Oh, I have 20 access.
[34:34.45]Oh.
[34:36.01]I get it.
[34:36.33]Is there a door here?
[34:48.48]Let me see a door.
[34:53.68]Hmm.
[34:55.80]drop down, yeah, but I don't want to miss anything, look, I can go, I don't want to miss anything, oh, I see what you're saying, yeah, yep, I get it, I know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, I see, I know, I know, I know, I know, I get you, I get you, I get you,
[35:24.05]Intentionally frustrating fall joke.
[35:37.96]Okay.
[35:40.10]Alright, where is it at?
[35:49.22]What side is it on?
[35:49.89]Is it over here?
[35:54.67]Okay.
[35:56.13]I don't think this is a jump.
[36:03.12]Memory of an important NPC.
[36:08.04]How do I get out of here?
[36:13.26]Can I get out of here?
[36:21.50]Yes, I can.
[36:24.28]Alright, let's continue.
[36:25.04]Let's get out of the tutorial.
[36:34.07]Weapon upgrades?
[36:37.85]What's the thing that I do?
[36:38.67]Oh.
[36:40.59]Oh, this game's crunchies.
[36:44.60]You're gonna die to the first boss.
[36:46.22]I haven't gotten there yet, so just wait.
[36:55.68]I know a lot of you are pre... Some of you guys have like a notepad that just has like omega low so bad on it.
[37:02.05]So you can just go like control, control, control C, control.
[37:05.64]Just so you can paste it in here.
[37:06.50]You're ready for it.
[37:07.06]You have like a whole notepad ready.
[37:09.74]But I'm not going to die to the first boss.
[37:12.40]So might as well clear your clipboard.
[37:26.58]Ooh, that's cool.
[37:33.71]That, clear your... Clear, like, your clipboard.
[37:35.47]Just clear your cache and everything.
[37:38.02]Creep some memory, because you're not going to need it.
[37:50.56]Hold down B?
[37:50.96]Yeah, it doesn't sprint.
[37:52.78]Oh.
[37:52.88]I like the dynamic here.
[37:53.74]Left stick is sprint.
[37:55.60]It is?
[37:56.28]Oh.
[37:56.42]I want to make that a toggle.
[37:58.87]I know it was in the options here somewhere.
[38:20.13]Toggle sprint.
[38:20.93]There it is.
[38:24.11]Oh, no.
[38:24.53]Wait a minute.
[38:26.88]Let's make this even better.
[38:31.12]Yeah.
[38:31.50]Okay.
[38:31.78]Now that's familiar.
[38:36.74]Takes a lot of stamina.
[38:37.64]Okay.
[38:37.78]This is the first boss.
[38:38.58]Everyone get your copy and paste shit ready.
[38:41.07]Okay.
[38:49.88]Is there a crouch?
[38:50.42]I don't think I can crouch.
[39:08.28]Don't give up.
[39:08.74]We need you.
[39:25.44]Okay, I got it.
[39:30.80]Staging room NPCs only.
[39:32.88]Oh, wait.
[39:34.22]There's probably an item.
[39:40.42]Oh, fuck.
[39:41.78]Oh, fuck.
[39:42.18]Oh, fuck.
[39:42.48]Oh, fuck.
[39:42.80]Oh, fuck.
[39:43.10]Oh, fuck.
[39:43.40]Oh, fuck.
[39:43.72]Oh, fuck.
[39:45.67]Oh, fuck.
[39:46.95]Oh, fuck.
[39:48.11]I went the wrong way.
[39:54.28]There's a whole nother area over there.
[40:11.47]Turn already.
[40:17.94]Why am I ignoring the door?
[40:20.20]I wanted to come up here.
[40:25.28]Because there's an area up here that I... Woo!
[40:31.27]Hall of Heroes Staging Room Key.
[40:34.77]Wait.
[40:35.33]Bonfire?
[40:37.03]Bonfire.
[40:37.57]Locksmith's Serrated Saw.
[40:56.89]More access.
[40:59.14]Be our hero.
[41:00.52]Well, not yet.
[41:01.06]I gotta go check out that other thing.
[41:05.22]There's so many weapons already.
[41:06.46]Okay, what about... Light the beacon.
[41:10.48]Should I go fight that?
[41:11.20]I'm gonna go fight that thing in the middle.
[41:16.79]By the almighty.
[41:19.31]Impossible.
[41:21.43]You're... You're... What in the void are you?
[41:33.23]Oh, you don't know what you are or why you're here.
[41:38.79]Do you want me to guide you?
[41:41.00]I don't know.
[41:48.21]you are no hero and I am no travel brochure now I have no idea what your little gestures were meant to convey probably rude but I will tell you what you are proof that nostalgaia is dying and what a stick person gesture can I level up
[42:11.26]Level up.
[42:12.48]Ah, sometimes you may want to backtrack.
[42:15.61]Tether to a beacon before you do so.
[42:18.21]Later, when you are finished backtracking, you can warp to your tethered beacon.
[42:21.71]This will allow you to pick up where you left off.
[42:26.03]Okay, so tether here?
[42:28.87]Like, tether warp?
[42:31.26]Like, does this count as me tethering here?
[42:33.36]Or did I just tell it?
[42:33.96]Where did I just go?
[42:34.50]Okay.
[42:39.80]Okay.
[42:47.48]Okay, so tether.
[42:48.58]Alright, level up.
[42:52.54]What do I do?
[42:53.40]Luck?
[42:56.14]15 luck gets me a new ability.
[42:58.10]What should I do?
[42:58.80]I don't know.
[43:00.02]I mean, vitality?
[43:01.22]Stamina?
[43:07.24]Set your tether first.
[43:12.04]Okay, so this is tethered.
[43:17.49]Let's go all luck.
[43:19.37]All in on luck.
[43:23.23]This is such a bad idea.
[43:24.37]I want 10 stamina.
[43:27.91]What about equipment load?
[43:36.85]Yeah.
[43:37.19]Alright, I'm happy with that.
[43:42.86]I hope.
[43:43.74]That was a good idea.
[43:46.32]Wait, I have crunchies too.
[43:49.98]How much does this do?
[43:58.64]Luck only.
[44:00.27]I need 200 more.
[44:01.05]I should get it from this.
[44:07.81]What do you think?
[44:08.27]Last point in luck?
[44:14.76]Really?
[44:15.06]It's 1100.
[44:16.32]Oh my God.
[44:16.88]We'll just kill something.
[44:26.07]There we go.
[44:26.43]Okay.
[44:26.99]Get all up.
[44:30.85]I'm gonna go kill the thing in the middle.
[44:37.33]Stamina?
[44:38.43]Or health?
[44:39.77]I'm gonna say just get stamina up.
[44:42.83]Alright, let's go.
[44:43.47]I'm gonna go fight this fucking thing right in the middle.
[44:45.03]I'm excited.
[44:55.85]I didn't mean to press that.
[44:59.24]Reset.
[45:03.00]Reset it.
[45:04.10]What the fuck?
[45:05.26]What?
[45:05.54]Why is it over here?
[45:06.58]Why is it over here?
[45:09.56]I was not ready for this.
[45:20.78]There it is.
[45:21.32]All right.
[45:21.56]Hope you bet for me.
[45:22.48]I hope you bet for me because I beat it.
[45:29.12]Oh, now all of a sudden everybody's freaking out.
[45:31.72]Everybody wants to change their bet.
[45:34.00]Yeah, sorry.
[45:34.76]If you're at the roulette table and it's spinning and you put it all on black and they say no more bets, sorry.
[45:49.96]It's so funny.
[45:50.90]I looked over and I saw the... That was an immediate change.
[45:55.54]When it was down to like half, 20% health very quickly, it was like 200,000 points.
[46:02.82]And it jumped to like 3 million in one or two seconds.
[46:05.45]That's so stupid.
[46:10.89]All right.
[46:12.07]First boss is down.
[46:14.81]It was so fast.
[46:20.10]That was only a moderately large enemy, dude.
[46:22.50]Alright, now I want to go back to this thing where the key was.
[46:24.10]Okay.
[46:38.22]What the fuck?
[46:41.98]Um, this is a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.
[46:53.68]Jesus!
[46:54.14]There's too many in here.
[47:00.89]There are too many in here.
[47:09.93]Remember to smile while you stab them.
[47:12.93]Remember to occasionally miss.
[47:14.69]I like that.
[47:15.19]So this is where they hang out.
[47:16.79]Ooh.
[47:42.38]Is it a real door?
[47:42.96]This is not stable.
[47:46.32]Wait.
[47:50.15]Huh?
[47:53.19]There's somebody behind that door.
[48:09.83]Alright, that's cool.
[48:11.65]It changes.
[48:12.19]Okay, I like that.
[48:17.19]Fireplace stone.
[48:23.37]Ooh, it's a new area.
[48:31.06]There's more to look at out here.
[48:38.66]Locked
[48:41.96]Why are you playing as a Minecraft sword?
[48:43.90]I don't know.
[48:46.89]Wait, why not?
[48:49.09]Alright, so there's a new area that way, but there's something behind here too.
[49:07.28]What is over here?
[49:19.40]memory is sacred you are not worthy receive blessing no the hero was rejected
[49:41.06]Oh, that's great.
[49:48.23]I love this walk.
[49:49.89]This is... I love this.
[49:52.87]This reminds me of Demon's Souls.
[49:54.47]The music.
[49:56.37]Of what do I do?
[49:56.93]So I wait for a swing.
[49:59.43]That hurt a lot.
[50:04.32]Fuck.
[50:04.94]Can I parry it?
[50:07.18]He's doing the yoinky splanky.
[50:18.12]Did it work?
[50:23.16]I'm not taking damage, but it's not working.
[50:24.74]All right, well, I don't think I can.
[50:29.85]Oops.
[50:36.79]This music is great.
[50:49.71]I'm dodging and it didn't work!
[50:53.85]Jesus!
[50:55.23]It's so long!
[50:56.30]Fuck!
[50:56.66]Alright, I get it.
[50:58.94]It's not hard.
[51:20.36]It's just that... Here it comes.
[51:31.84]Boss fights require timing and patience.
[51:34.89]At first, it might seem like there's no safe time to attack.
[51:38.15]But if you pay attention, a window will open.
[51:42.41]I think I'm going.
[51:43.01]We're going, Axe.
[51:47.48]I can't parry it.
[51:49.74]You just got Luigi'd?
[51:50.64]No, I got a tutorial message.
[51:52.86]There's a difference.
[52:03.25]Fuck!
[52:06.33]It reminds me of the... Okay, I pressed it!
[52:09.09]I pressed dodge!
[52:10.69]What the hell?
[52:16.09]There we go, alright.
[52:29.35]Oh my god, he went to kick me!
[52:32.39]He got way harder!
[53:01.75]Fuck!
[53:08.65]Oh, all right.
[53:09.61]You gotta be a little early.
[53:10.55]Ooh, the crits happen randomly.
[53:26.76]I like it.
[53:38.70]Let's go.
[53:40.30]This is fun.
[53:41.00]Wait, that might not be it.
[53:46.36]Finish him.
[53:56.44]Huh?
[54:02.06]Shield of inspiration.
[54:08.85]He did it.
[54:10.68]These extra tutorial messages will now stop.
[54:13.80]The last hero of Nostalgia is a mystery.
[54:17.18]What are you?
[54:18.12]What happened to this world?
[54:19.80]What is expected of you?
[54:21.48]You won't be handed the answers.
[54:23.36]Can you uncover them?
[54:27.65]This game is cool.
[54:35.93]That music was good too.
[54:36.99]Yeah.
[54:43.50]Time to blow up this whole character and ruin it and have to start over in like an hour.
[54:49.28]Um... You can't go wrong with vitality and stamina.
[55:01.54]Until I figure out what I want.
[55:02.71]I don't know.
[55:03.75]I'm too scared to do anything.
[55:06.19]Up strength a little?
[55:13.09]Let me just... Hold on.
[55:13.75]Let me see what I got.
[55:17.17]Did I get anything new?
[55:24.71]Attribute bonus.
[55:25.97]Dexterity, 1.1.
[55:27.37]2.3.
[55:27.39]2, 2.2.
[55:27.49]So this is the biggest scaling, then.
[55:33.81]Luck influences crits, so that might... That stat might actually be really good.
[55:37.78]It seemed like it was pretty good.
[55:44.42]So this is just a better shield.
[55:47.62]It's bigger.
[55:56.03]Is there anything else on it?
[55:57.63]Stability, weight, physical.
[55:59.17]This is 100% physical damage reduction.
[56:04.83]Cool.
[56:06.04]Oh, there's no parry anymore.
[56:07.56]I'm the parry class.
[56:11.66]Fuck, I don't know what to do.
[56:18.95]Saw.
[56:27.16]This thing's pretty good.
[56:30.16]Ooh.
[56:31.18]Two handed.
[56:31.60]Pretty good too.
[56:35.10]Oh, it's a key.
[56:43.50]Alright, I have to make a choice.
[56:45.47]And that choice is to be a coward and just do stamina and health until I figure out what the hell I'm doing.
[56:52.94]Coward plays, but it's alright.
[56:54.10]Yeah, it's always good.
[57:00.77]It's never a bad idea.
[57:14.29]Art flow altered.
[57:15.47]The pixel art and the not pixel art.
[57:17.93]I like the style of this game.
[57:19.57]There's also that other way too.
[57:39.26]What class am I playing?
[57:40.04]I'm playing the luck.
[57:42.30]I forget what this class is named.
[57:43.59]It's called like random, random class, random master or something.
[57:50.65]Yeah, I'm going to go explore that other area.
[57:57.42]You're fat rolling right now.
[58:06.96]There is bat rolling.
[58:08.68]Okay, well, what is actually doing more damage?
[58:11.58]I think I'm gonna stay with the... Yeah, I'm gonna stay with the axe.
[58:20.74]I'm so pumped for this playthrough.
[58:25.26]Yeah, I mean, how long is this game?
[58:33.73]I'm just gonna run.
[58:41.68]It's about 15.
[58:43.10]That's cool.
[58:44.28]I'm just going to play it until I don't really care anymore.
[58:47.20]Maybe I'll beat it.
[58:49.58]It seems interesting enough to continue to play.
[58:54.65]It's definitely got me.
[58:57.23]I have been gotten.
[58:58.55]The game has grabbed my attention for sure.
[59:02.86]NPC City.
[59:11.61]Don't even... Get over here!
[59:23.96]Oh my god.
[59:26.72]Stop!
[59:28.43]Stop!
[59:28.87]Okay.
[59:37.35]NPC city.
[59:41.93]Descend quickly is B. Is there a jump?
[59:57.08]I don't think so.
[60:08.76]Oh, these are weird.
[60:09.60]Okay, that really hurt.
[60:12.36]Alright, ladder's back there.
[60:21.17]Blood of Nostalgia.
[60:25.67]Interesting.
[60:31.41]Are there bonfires?
[60:32.20]There are.
[60:37.45]How mad are you that you guys just voted for a regular ass enemy?
[60:42.94]Because, wait.
[60:43.88]No, this is back at... Wait, where am I?
[60:46.48]This is that other room.
[60:49.16]That hurt a lot.
[60:53.60]Okay, too bad you didn't vote this time.
[60:59.78]I actually did try to dodge and it didn't work.
[61:02.57]I pressed... I wouldn't have just sat there.
[61:04.71]I promised.
[61:17.83]He dodged into it.
[61:18.93]You know what I think it is?
[61:20.39]This game has freeze frame when you get hit.
[61:24.60]So what's probably happening is because the freeze frame of being hit is overriding your dodge.
[61:31.16]So there are frames for being hit.
[61:33.28]Therefore, if it's not perfect, you're going to get that frame from hit damage, right?
[61:39.18]Interesting stuff.
[61:41.08]Because there is freeze hits.
[61:43.41]But what did I get from doing that?
[61:44.82]I mean, I opened the door, but does that really do anything for me?
[62:03.63]Today I learned when you get hit, you can't dodge.
[62:06.45]Well, no, I'm just saying like the game has freeze hits.
[62:09.81]You know what I mean by that?
[62:11.19]You know what I mean?
[62:12.85]Freeze damage.
[62:13.61]When you get hit, the whole game goes for like one second, like half second.
[62:20.05]So what was down here that I could do?
[62:34.92]I hate these things already.
[62:39.24]No!
[62:39.78]Stop!
[62:40.16]Okay, I'm fine.
[62:48.72]Yeah, the ladder will take me back up, but what was the point of coming down here in the first place?
[62:52.94]Just to open up this shortcut?
[62:54.29]But for what?
[62:57.17]I guess if you keep dying to the boss?
[63:00.23]Is it just for fun?
[63:10.13]Check the doors.
[63:10.75]It looked like I couldn't open any of them.
[63:16.65]I don't think I can open any of these.
[63:19.41]I think it's just to teach you that shortcuts exist and that they can be used.
[63:27.14]Or, I mean, maybe this opens later.
[63:29.24]This right here, the sewers or something.
[63:30.90]I don't know.
[63:32.48]Yeah, it's probably for later.
[63:33.50]Well, I'm just going to run.
[63:34.12]I don't want to fight this thing.
[63:42.55]I ran the way that I should not have run.
[63:44.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:45.57]Is this different?
[63:47.03]Wait, what's happening?
[63:47.77]Where am I?
[63:49.57]Is this different?
[64:00.08]Where am I going?
[64:00.56]This is the beginning of the whole game.
[64:03.23]Alright, I'm running this way.
[64:10.95]So there really is no purpose to that.
[64:12.39]And this is just later.
[64:13.69]Maybe just, you know, I might just die.
[64:18.25]I'm imagining like there was a purpose to that opening that.
[64:21.23]But I guess there is none.
[64:34.54]I can't run up that.
[64:36.58]I'm going to die here.
[64:39.24]Maybe not.
[64:45.56]You can do it.
[64:50.18]Uh... Yeah, it's over here.
[65:01.65]Did I just seriously run all the way back down?
[65:08.32]But wait a minute.
[65:08.90]No, okay, yeah.
[65:09.60]I was like, what the fuck is happening right now?
[65:14.58]There is no point to that.
[65:16.82]How come there's no point?
[65:17.52]It's just like a little Easter egg.
[65:28.43]Where are we?
[65:29.19]We made it back here.
[65:30.07]I'm good.
[65:30.63]I'm good.
[65:30.97]I'm good.
[65:33.41]I can't cheese it.
[65:34.31]I have to fight everything that's aggroed.
[65:35.82]Oh, that's not good.
[65:36.64]At least I'll end up right here.
[65:43.26]What is he on about?
[65:43.92]I opened up, like, a door over there, and it went down to, like, the... You're here!
[65:49.06]What do you mean?
[65:49.72]You're literally watching!
[65:50.86]I just did it!
[65:55.10]Okay, stamina.
[66:02.47]Lost Larry.
[66:12.48]I had my eyes closed because I was scared.
[66:14.56]Oh, alright.
[66:16.24]I'm sorry, man.
[66:17.94]I didn't mean to say that.
[66:24.18]The secret's all over games like this.
[66:25.58]You have to be prepared for running around in circles.
[66:39.37]Alright, there's a bonfire.
[66:39.93]Secrets?
[66:41.22]Secrets?
[66:44.82]It looks climbable, doesn't it?
[66:51.61]Well... Is this a... Oh.
[66:59.49]Should I kill him?
[67:14.41]Not going to kill him.
[67:21.57]Marvelous.
[67:25.06]Yeah.
[67:31.60]Alright, tether.
[67:35.39]So this is how you warp.
[67:36.91]That's cool.
[67:37.57]Okay.
[67:38.43]What does return icon mean?
[67:41.32]look upon the world around you what you have restored by your touch a hero is known by their actions yes oh yeah I know what you are or rather what you might prove to be you do not know yourself though do you memory of what was is vanishing but do not despair
[68:10.08]Hmm.
[68:10.20]R1, R1, R1.
[68:10.48]Okay.
[68:10.66]Item description.
[68:39.33]This relic has a pixelating memory.
[68:42.69]If you can help the relic remember, it will get stronger.
[68:46.41]The location of its memory could be anywhere in the world.
[68:49.75]Relics in the correct location will quiver in your inventory.
[68:53.98]To find the location, listen to what it tells you.
[68:57.18]See how this relic mentions an old man?
[68:59.20]Try standing beside the old man, selecting this relic, and choosing remember.
[69:03.86]Oh.
[69:08.14]This is kind of cool.
[69:15.67]Spin slash.
[69:18.79]Holy shit.
[69:24.36]As you remember different relics, you will gain permanent insight bonuses.
[69:28.14]That's highly advantage... A lot of advantage to remembering relics, even if you don't equip them.
[69:35.42]See your player status screen for your insight bonuses.
[69:41.99]Okay.
[69:45.90]But now this is just better.
[69:46.76]Cool.
[69:50.56]Remarkable.
[69:52.58]I had feared such depth to be lost forever.
[69:56.40]You may be whom I've been waiting for.
[70:00.30]Nostalgia is dying.
[70:03.80]The Great Forgetting is taking us all.
[70:06.12]The Great Forgetting?
[70:07.74]Into pixelization and then...
[70:11.56]Oblivion.
[70:13.02]Heroes.
[70:14.26]The Great Ones, most especially, were meant to save Nostalgaia, but they have forsaken their purpose.
[70:21.11]They now choke the arteries meant to carry memory back into our world's heart.
[70:27.01]I remember their failures.
[70:29.37]That's a cool concept.
[70:30.89]Ooh, they're the big bad ones.
[70:32.71]Ooh, you got the gate open for me, thank you.
[70:33.89]Oh, they always did that, it was so fun.
[70:59.39]They would all be like, please, stop it!
[71:01.44]What are you... Oh, so it's a fight you want!
[71:11.40]You have one item that can be remembered here.
[71:16.92]Increase crit... I need to... Wait, I do?
[71:18.70]Did I already do it?
[71:20.02]Are these moving?
[71:24.46]I don't think so.
[71:30.00]Okay.
[71:31.38]Let's just go.
[71:39.96]Locked.
[71:43.54]Heart of a hero.
[71:44.40]Heart of a hero's touch.
[71:45.30]Heart of a hero's path.
[71:47.34]Let's start our gear.
[71:52.35]Hold 22...
[71:58.37]This relic's memory yearns to be found.
[72:00.23]New heroes were once tutorialized that the heart of heroism is not gold and glitter, pomp and celebration, but humility and ultimately sacrifice.
[72:10.04]They were taught how to give back to nostalgia.
[72:13.80]So I gotta go to the tutorial room?
[72:21.53]Look to its heart.
[72:31.87]Okay.
[72:35.82]Art of a hero.
[72:37.88]Should I go to the tutorial room?
[72:43.48]He was like, oh, tutorials are very interesting.
[72:47.97]Maybe that'll do it.
[72:58.11]Memory lingers in an undiscovered location.
[73:00.73]That's what it would say, right?
[73:03.87]Undiscovered region.
[73:05.61]Okay, okay.
[73:06.05]Yep, yep, yep.
[73:06.46]Alright, let's go.
[73:08.66]That's an... I like that mechanic.
[73:10.72]Remembering ahead.
[73:12.62]Wait, is this real?
[73:25.99]People putting those down?
[73:30.29]Alright, that's cool.
[73:31.01]What the hell is this?
[73:41.34]Peer down.
[73:43.16]Do I want to do that?
[73:47.72]Remember offense.
[73:52.83]Message box.
[73:53.69]Yeah, it is in the game.
[73:54.87]It is.
[73:58.23]Nostalgia's heart is constricted.
[74:00.04]Barely any memory goes in or comes out.
[74:07.38]I gotta repair this.
[74:14.59]Nostalgia.
[74:17.93]And so at an old man's behest, the stick figure raised its frail limbs to limply push onward.
[74:26.36]The hero's journey, too arduous for its meager pixels, would prove a humorous... Bad guy.
[74:38.49]How do I do the slash?
[74:39.35]It's like a spinning slash, right?
[74:44.19]Spin slash.
[74:46.29]How do I do it?
[74:50.74]Okay, it's, uh, L2.
[74:55.62]These are a lot of, um... Oh, God.
[75:01.53]Alright, the scale of the game was very small up until five seconds ago.
[75:07.92]Suddenly, lust.
[75:08.76]I'm not reading all these.
[75:27.90]So it's pretty good.
[75:32.49]Soon the walking scribble would understand all that was lost.
[75:38.93]This is Dark Souls 1.
[75:40.57]What is it called?
[75:41.99]That area with the capper demon?
[75:55.18]Undead Burg.
[75:55.72]Yeah, that's what it might be.
[76:03.19]Yeah, I'm dumping at every point into luck.
[76:05.13]I'll be critting at like a 30 to 40% rate.
[76:09.73]Why does this actually look fun as hell?
[76:13.03]Because it is.
[76:15.67]It is.
[76:17.36]It is fun.
[76:17.88]Blurring ahead.
[76:22.36]Oh, there's only one rating on this.
[76:25.92]Warshaft village.
[76:26.86]You carry one relic that can be remembered ahead.
[76:31.92]Yep.
[76:35.83]Oh my god.
[76:36.81]That's so many people.
[77:21.98]That was a lot scarier than it was hard.
[77:30.55]Get your quest and leave.
[77:33.71]Keep moving.
[77:37.87]What's going on here?
[77:45.30]Hello?
[77:45.42]Hello?
[77:47.69]That was a very loud sounding monster.
[78:01.71]What is that?
[78:07.09]Okay, well we gotta go in there.
[78:20.79]Jesus.
[78:21.17]Okay, don't fucking die here.
[78:34.82]Okay.
[78:36.58]Dab on them, dude.
[78:39.12]I'm working on it.
[78:42.55]I don't want to... I have plenty of heals and I don't want to reset the area, so I'm not going to do that yet.
[79:07.52]The windows are frowning.
[79:08.66]Yeah, they are.
[79:12.84]Little room.
[79:13.56]Oh, wait.
[79:14.36]Oh, wait a minute.
[79:15.52]Don't go there.
[79:21.81]What?
[79:23.03]Okay.
[79:36.19]No!
[79:36.47]Out of stamina, fuck!
[79:37.41]That's a lot of hurt.
[79:49.04]Alright.
[79:58.17]The rolling... Uh, the rolling's fine.
[80:03.22]Unlocked somewhere else.
[80:04.22]Alright.
[80:05.78]I am not going to remember any of this, so I hope people in chat are paying attention.
[80:08.58]Because I'm not going to.
[80:09.80]I won't know.
[80:19.00]I hope there's at least one person here keeping a log of every single place that my character has gone.
[80:25.49]I know there's somebody in here doing it.
[80:29.53]Because I'm just kind of wandering, and that's always a bad thing to do in games like this.
[80:34.21]But I'm alright.
[80:36.21]I'm going to turn around after this.
[80:47.92]Dude, everyone is too high to do that.
[80:50.36]I don't think that's accurate.
[81:05.39]I can do that too, you know.
[81:06.37]Nice.
[81:13.33]Alright.
[81:14.33]So far, so good.
[81:20.27]Hmm.
[81:21.90]Hmm.
[81:24.76]Hmm.
[81:31.54]Oh!
[81:32.42]How did I not hit you?
[81:37.42]Alright, I'm gonna turn around.
[81:43.70]Just one more of these rooms.
[81:47.12]Fireplace stone.
[81:58.09]Yes.
[81:59.84]Prickly mirror?
[82:02.06]What was that?
[82:11.72]Brickly Mirror Code.
[82:19.68]Is this a spell?
[82:22.78]Your stats are too low to use this.
[82:26.83]Oh, I need whatever that is.
[82:32.75]All right, so that's a spell.
[82:36.68]Well, cool.
[82:46.28]You don't matter.
[82:47.16]Is this that elevator?
[83:07.99]Weird.
[83:08.41]Okay.
[83:11.24]I'm not jumping in there.
[83:21.34]I'm not jumping in there.
[83:22.12]There's treasure in there.
[83:24.92]You don't know that.
[83:27.09]I'll come back later.
[83:37.32]You loser.
[83:40.21]I didn't do the thing you wanted me to do.
[83:42.51]Alright, I'm coming out here now.
[83:44.89]Where I could go the other way.
[83:46.53]You know what?
[83:47.87]Alright, I'm out of here.
[83:49.43]I gotta get out of here.
[83:50.27]I'm not doing this.
[83:51.65]I have to go... I gotta go this way.
[83:54.39]And then I gotta go down.
[83:56.33]I'm going to that bonfire that was out here.
[84:02.02]Yeah.
[84:02.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[84:04.14]I got 3,500 memory.
[84:06.68]I haven't even turned this on yet.
[84:17.19]So is it Dex?
[84:27.09]I wonder if it's Dex or just... I already made the decision and it was probably wrong.
[84:46.03]Alright, so... I could go over here.
[84:48.99]Oh, I can remember here.
[84:54.48]What can I remember?
[84:55.20]I don't see anything shaking.
[85:02.04]No?
[85:08.61]No?
[85:14.91]Wait, we have to go in here.
[85:16.31]Right, come on.
[85:18.69]How are we not going in here?
[85:24.57]It's not even real.
[85:26.95]Oh, it's a way for you to die, but they were in the middle of their NPC route and they didn't see me.
[85:36.36]It's bait for you to get killed by these, but they were all the way at the bottom of their cycle.
[85:49.47]Shit, this is bad.
[85:53.28]I'm gonna die down here.
[85:57.34]No, I'm dead.
[85:57.90]Alright, so, let me... Let me try this again.
[86:12.79]Do a weed pole?
[86:16.23]No, I don't care.
[86:17.31]I don't care if you're high or not high.
[86:25.62]Avoid enemy.
[86:26.44]Oh, I should have read these.
[86:28.08]Enemies ahead.
[86:28.62]No, that's... Hey, look.
[86:35.55]That's between you and you.
[86:38.01]That has nothing to do with me.
[86:40.25]I don't need to know that.
[86:48.13]Item down here.
[86:52.25]Why would I avoid these enemies when there's an item at the bottom?
[87:04.14]Come on.
[87:09.50]Don't not.
[87:17.82]It's worth it, trust me.
[87:20.80]He hates people that use weed.
[87:25.56]Oh, it's I can't do it, and suddenly I can't do it.
[87:32.45]Oh.
[87:36.83]Nothing here, though.
[87:37.53]I can't go in there.
[87:48.67]Well, at least we got to see it.
[87:50.59]OK, so I'm going to go up.
[87:52.68]Or I don't know.
[87:57.68]Maybe I'll try to fight that little mini boss.
[88:18.58]Okay.
[88:22.66]Legend of Independence.
[88:27.25]Used for weapon upgrades.
[88:28.47]Okay.
[88:36.04]Alright.
[88:36.52]I'm gonna go for it.
[88:37.26]Let's fight this thing.
[88:38.24]And I hope I can do it well.
[88:39.46]Try remembering.
[88:40.92]Oh!
[88:41.28]Thanks for the cheating.
[88:48.33]Oh, they were full of shit.
[88:49.07]OK, wait, they mean inside.
[88:53.43]Suddenly annoying enemy.
[88:58.85]Oh, they're lying, OK?
[89:13.60]Oh, that hurt.
[89:18.06]Can we please do an allergy poll?
[89:19.58]Okay, yeah.
[89:24.06]How many people here are allergic to peanuts?
[89:27.02]That sounds fun.
[89:28.41]That's not really fun, but how many people are allergic to peanuts in chat?
[89:34.09]Ooh.
[89:37.69]Just an unassuming and insignificant house.
[89:56.60]I look cool.
[90:01.50]Are you allergic to peanuts?
[90:05.76]Really?
[90:06.02]Oh.
[90:21.51]Okay, so... Luck bonuses.

[90:38.72]So this is milestones for luck.
[90:42.70]Two times memory.
[90:43.90]Healing costs nothing?
[90:47.98]Alright.
[90:50.40]This game's pretty cool.
[90:56.39]95% Okay, so 5% of the audience here is allergic to peanuts.
[91:00.84]It's kind of interesting.
[91:05.30]Alright, I'm going to go up.
[91:06.94]Or should I?
[91:07.34]Maybe I'll go this way.
[91:13.70]Because there's a way to go.
[91:15.12]No, I went this way before.
[91:16.10]I'm going to go here.
[91:16.58]I'm just going to rest and then go up.
[91:28.47]What about shellfish?
[91:31.45]Uh, yeah.
[91:32.25]How many people here are allergic to shellfish?
[91:40.47]5% peanut allergy Andes.
[91:43.85]Why did I say it like that?
[91:45.74]I was trying to think of like a way to say that.
[91:48.58]That was like such a dumb way to say that.
[92:08.10]Allergy Andes.
[92:10.59]You know, thankfully, I am not allergic to anything that I know of.
[92:15.87]Alright, this is strength.
[92:25.73]Cool looking though.
[92:27.38]Can't get in here.
[92:32.86]Well, because I was trying to figure out, like, people that have... I wanted to say people that have peanut allergies.
[92:38.66]But I said peanut allergies first.
[92:41.74]So I was like, oh, wow.
[92:42.56]Like, we have a lot of people who are allergic to peanuts.
[92:45.81]But I said we have peanut... Oh, I already said the first... I already said it.
[92:51.23]So how do I fix that mid-sentence?
[92:55.63]5% again.
[92:56.25]Damn.
[92:56.55]Okay.
[92:59.72]So where's game progress?
[93:06.56]Nice.
[93:09.83]Game progress over here?
[93:14.07]No, I came from over here.
[93:15.37]Where is game progress?
[93:21.46]Up from where I was?
[93:22.16]Because that's locked.
[93:34.59]Do lactose intolerance.
[93:35.67]Do lactose intolerance.
[93:36.73]Alright, alright, alright.
[93:44.39]I'm at game progress.
[93:49.87]I wish I could close this door.
[93:50.93]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[93:56.59]You know, I feel like lactose intolerance is going to be pretty high.
[94:03.21]Alright, one more.
[94:04.07]Are you lactose intolerant?
[94:09.79]Oh.
[94:10.93]Oh my god.
[94:11.67]What a disaster.
[94:23.01]Oh, this is it.
[94:36.88]Nope.
[94:38.14]Alright, I know where to go.
[94:38.90]I know where to go.
[94:47.99]This pole is weird.
[94:49.03]This is a goofy pole.
[94:56.30]Is it?
[94:56.52]I don't think it's that goofy.
[94:58.18]Nice goofy ass pole.
[95:03.70]Alright, I'm not going to aggro the entire instance.
[95:07.42]I'm going to sit down again.
[95:10.29]These, you got to dodge.
[95:12.33]Okay, these things are hard.
[95:13.85]Because dodging back doesn't help.
[95:16.45]I got to dodge right.
[95:19.25]And then you get put lined up.
[95:20.49]No.
[95:21.03]How do I...
[95:24.62]That's a shitload of people that are lacto... Hold on, it's 25%?
[95:28.12]26% is lactose intolerant?
[95:31.08]I just lost those souls, but this is an incredibly eye-opening experience to see this.
[95:35.87]25% said lactose intolerant.
[95:39.31]Jesus.
[95:40.93]That's a lot.
[95:49.28]I actually, I haven't had that much milk.
[95:52.75]And you know, I'm full of shit.
[95:54.55]And I know I'm full of shit.
[95:55.69]So I can tell you that before we talk about this.
[95:58.23]But I'm one of those, well, let's be real.
[96:00.31]I gotta be honest.
[96:01.53]So I'm one of those people that says I don't take in that much dairy.
[96:05.49]Like, no, I don't take in that much dairy anymore.
[96:07.19]You know, oat milk.
[96:09.27]I drink oat milk and I put oat milk in my coffee.
[96:11.51]I still eat a shitload of cheese.
[96:13.48]I still eat a ton of fucking ice cream.
[96:15.88]I'm full of shit.
[96:20.99]right and it sucks it I because I really do want you know I I try to get you I don't want to I want to I'm eating I'm trying to eat better you know trying to get cut out dairy dairy is just it feels like bad for my skin and but how do you how do you replace cheese like how and and I've tried the cheese alternatives and they are not good they are not good let's be real
[96:50.21]I've tried a bunch of them.
[96:57.67]A sharp cheddar cheese.
[96:58.91]Oh, my God.
[97:01.15]Like, I... It can never be replaced.
[97:04.09]If they figure it out, I'm willing to try.
[97:05.99]I am.
[97:06.81]I'm very willing to try it.
[97:08.85]But, like, an extremely sharp cheddar cheese.
[97:11.28]Oh, no.
[97:12.40]It's irreplaceable.
[97:16.62]I'd like to play the game now.
[97:17.64]Okay.
[97:18.06]Okay.
[97:29.61]Jesus is addictive Yeah, I mean I could I could see that it just tastes so good I
[97:44.98]But milk, uh, no.
[97:47.52]If there's one thing that I can tell you that I have absolutely completely cut out of my entire diet, it's just regular milk.
[97:55.04]It's just... No.
[97:57.36]No thanks.
[97:58.50]Something about it now even that kind of grosses me out.
[98:08.10]Like, I still eat meat and everything.
[98:09.67]Like, I don't know.
[98:14.24]Just eat what you like.
[98:15.77]And just try to be conscious of just, you know, just be conscious.
[98:18.67]In all things in moderation, Ben Franklin was the smartest fucking person to ever live.
[98:24.35]I've said that a thousand times on this stream.
[98:26.27]Ben Franklin is the smartest man ever.
[98:28.54]So listen to Ben Franklin.
[98:29.80]All things in moderation.
[98:31.00]Don't eat steak every day.
[98:32.62]You can have it.
[98:33.34]Have it when you feel like it.
[98:34.34]You don't have to eat it every single day.
[98:36.16]Don't chug milk every day.
[98:38.41]Ben Franklin wouldn't have done that.
[98:41.61]Item ahead.
[98:46.00]Watch me like Ben Franklin was like a huge proponent of drinking milk every day.
[98:53.69]All things in moderation, except of course for milk.
[98:58.03]All Americans should be drinking at least two gallons of milk a day.
[99:01.73]And those of you that disagree... I'm dead.
[99:05.43]I gotta pay attention.
[99:06.13]No, I'm not gonna read that.
[99:12.64]Because I disagree.
[99:17.40]Ben Franklin is not... I refuse to say it because I don't believe you.
[99:22.09]I don't believe it.
[99:23.05]I refuse to say it.
[99:24.79]No, I'm not even going to manifest that.
[99:29.45]No, I'm not going to even manifest it because, no, I refuse to give that.
[99:32.83]I'm not going to even say that.
[99:36.33]I will say it.
[99:36.91]Okay, fine.
[99:39.49]All right.
[99:40.07]Ben Franklin is not in hell.
[99:42.35]The person that said that, time them out for five minutes.
[99:45.12]You said Ben Franklin's in hell, and no, I'm sorry, I don't believe you.
[99:49.31]Why is Ben Franklin in hell?
[99:51.07]No, I said it out loud, and now I don't know what to do.
[99:54.63]No, that's not real.
[99:55.85]Nope.
[99:56.77]Ben Franklin's not in hell.
[99:59.74]I have 1,500 souls on the ground, and you've lost them.
[100:02.22]You lost them, I didn't.
[100:10.56]Benjamin Franklin had a milk punch.
[100:13.98]He was a milk punch aficionado.
[100:17.65]It serves 12 people.
[100:19.15]6 cups of brandy, 11 lemons, 2 cups lemon juice, 4 cups water, 3 fourths cups sugar, 1 whole nutmeg, plus extra nutmeg for garnish, 3 cups whole milk, 1 remove peel from all 11 lemons with a vegetable peeler, taking care to remove only the yellow part.
[100:42.78]So he like, all right, but he probably, all right, but he probably only drank like two glasses of that.
[100:50.09]He got to the end of one.
[100:51.15]He was like, ah, that was delicious.
[100:54.11]I guess I'll have another.
[100:56.54]Delicious milk punch.
[100:58.16]Okay.
[100:58.94]Ah, that's another milk punch down.
[101:01.04]I've had enough.
[101:02.32]All things in moderation.
[101:03.54]And he just dumped the rest down the sink or something.
[101:05.54]You know what I mean?
[101:06.38]Or he like, he like gave it to other people.
[101:09.69]He, like, gave it to, like, a bunch of other people.
[101:11.51]He didn't drink at all.
[101:12.45]All things in moderation.
[101:18.43]He's in hell.
[101:19.93]He's in hell.
[101:21.85]No, no.
[101:23.01]I gotta play this game.
[101:23.95]I gotta play this game.
[101:25.49]He's in hell.
[102:02.39]Okay, I need to fucking relax.
[102:07.09]I need to relax.
[102:12.72]Poll if he's in hell or not.
[102:15.34]Fine, the last poll you're gonna get the whole night.
[102:17.90]Is Ben Franklin in hell?
[102:20.47]Yes or no?
[102:35.07]Eleven lemons and two cups of lemon juice.
[102:37.85]What?
[102:38.31]Yeah, what a weird fucking recipe.
[102:40.89]I do not... I would say do not drink that.
[102:57.88]Why did we get here?
[102:59.91]We were just asking if you had a peanut allergy.
[103:03.37]Now we need to... Now we're talking about Ben Franklin in hell?
[103:07.35]No!
[103:07.99]Alright, so 5% of you have a peanut allergy.
[103:10.04]That's interesting stuff.
[103:12.32]That's interesting stuff.
[103:14.60]Alright.
[103:16.32]Some of you got a peanut allergy, which... I've always wondered what that was potentially like.
[103:22.80]Alright.
[103:26.73]This is weirdly... Like, out of place.
[103:31.09]I'm slow.
[103:31.81]Oh, it's the poison.
[103:32.61]Okay.
[103:36.09]Yes.
[103:36.45]What the fuck?
[103:37.35]Okay.
[103:37.63]Yeah.
[103:48.51]Ben Franklin is definitely at least in purgatory.
[103:50.69]I love how somebody just said, it has been ruled.
[104:03.64]Why we don't get to decide that?
[104:06.54]What do you mean it has been ruled?
[104:12.87]Democracy.
[104:14.61]Democracy manifest.
[104:19.94]Can't believe it.
[104:24.04]Hmm?
[104:29.77]Nice crit.
[104:38.14]It's what Ben Franklin would have wanted.
[104:44.69]Ben Franklin could be sitting on, like, a cloud somewhere.
[104:48.19]And, like, God just kind of knocks on the door.
[104:50.69]Hey, Ben!
[104:51.94]Don't want to interrupt or anything, but there seems to be a poll going on in this weird fucking weirdo's channel.
[104:59.16]Jerma985.
[105:00.46]Probably you've never heard of him before.
[105:03.32]So they're voting to determine whether you go to hell or whether you're in hell or not.
[105:07.88]Gonna have to, I mean, you know, democracy manifest, right?
[105:14.59]God watches Jerma.
[105:16.73]No, whatever.
[105:23.23]Nice family guy bit.
[105:25.49]Hey, other pieces of media can reference God talking to people in purgatory, okay?
[105:31.28]It's not just family guy.
[105:33.30]Although that would happen on family guy.
[105:36.82]It'd be like, God, excuse me, Benjamin Franklin, whatever.
[105:43.34]Like, you don't act like you didn't laugh at a Family Guy joke before.
[105:45.66]Don't act like you never laughed at Family Guy.
[105:48.10]You're full of fucking, you're full of baloney.
[105:50.51]You're full of baloney.
[105:51.61]I know you're full of baloney.
[105:53.07]You have laughed at a Family Guy joke before.
[105:54.63]You're full of baloney.
[105:58.95]And yes, ironic Peter Griffin memes count.
[106:02.06]Ironic Peter Griffin memes count.
[106:04.74]You're full of baloney.
[106:09.74]Okay, so where do I go?
[106:19.61]Great one?
[106:20.23]Hmm?
[106:29.26]Family Guy has good jokes, but a lot of bad ones.
[106:33.30]Sure.
[106:35.14]But you still laughed at it.
[106:36.26]At that time.
[106:39.28]And you just can't stand it.
[106:44.83]He was sitting there on the couch.
[106:47.08]And I was like, ah Lois, remember the time that I met Ben Franklin in hell?
[106:51.50]And it played out, and you went, and covered your mouth and went, fuck!
[106:56.14]No, no!
[107:07.97]Um, okay, let me, what's the... Alright, time to do what I do and not pay attention for like half an hour.
[107:23.26]Interesting.
[107:29.90]Armor ahead.
[107:30.62]Should I just delete these?
[107:31.90]I always had these off during FromSoftware games.
[107:36.10]Because I feel like it's kind of cheating.
[107:38.12]Alright, this guy's scary.
[107:51.85]that hurts so much oh my god where is this where is this I don't remember I got hit I got killed in three hits I'm gonna run I'm gonna try to remember where that was as best as I can
[108:46.03]Yep, okay.
[108:46.75]Then it was this way, and then in here.
[108:48.43]Alright.
[108:58.96]Do not follow me.
[109:00.40]Open the gate?
[109:01.00]I will after this.
[109:04.84]Why is it on his head?
[109:05.52]Okay.
[109:19.87]Ow.
[109:28.97]No, we're not doing no more polls.
[109:29.87]We're not doing any more polls.
[109:31.63]Master Chef.
[109:35.09]Fireplace down.
[109:35.81]Wait, I just got a whole new set of gear.
[109:44.59]Cuts and scrapes.
[109:45.83]This thing's probably heavy.
[109:59.36]This thing is very heavy.
[110:00.28]Yeah, I'm overburdened right now.
[110:14.18]I think this is good gear for now.
[110:18.62]Anything else?
[110:19.16]Anything pulsing?
[110:21.78]No.
[110:23.02]He hates us.
[110:23.70]No, I don't.
[110:29.84]I just healed because he said that.
[110:36.81]Memory of an important NPC.
[110:38.11]Watch out for the NPC.
[110:47.57]Oh, God.
[110:48.71]Well, I definitely don't want to do that right now.
[110:54.85]Nostalgia did not want it.
[111:01.58]Uh, I just got a new weapon.
[111:02.78]93 plus 67.
[111:13.11]This thing's better.
[111:14.91]Higher crit too.
[111:27.92]I'm going to put the buckler on because I want to be able to parry.
[111:31.80]Okay.
[111:38.03]Well, I'm not doing that right now.
[111:45.49]I just made a quiche with half and half.
[111:52.24]You know what's funny about quiches?
[111:54.99]I feel like I've never seen anyone make a quiche.
[111:57.83]They just sort of appear randomly during the year at random holidays.
[112:02.21]I've never seen somebody make one.
[112:04.03]It's just like, oh, there's a quiche on this table.
[112:08.04]I've never seen anyone make it.
[112:09.24]It's like, oh, it's a quiche.
[112:12.06]Oh, okay.
[112:14.20]Alright.
[112:16.30]Alright, cool.
[112:19.58]Quiche is gross.
[112:20.27]I disagree.
[112:21.45]I disagree.
[112:24.78]I think default quiche is not great.
[112:26.20]Yeah, bacon ham quiche is really good.
[112:30.84]Ham and cheese quiche.
[112:41.30]Broccoli too?
[112:42.06]Oh yeah, that's good.
[112:42.68]Oops.
[113:10.90]Wow.
[113:11.70]He didn't even need the bench.
[113:13.20]This is him just completely asserting how strong of a character he really is.
[113:26.93]Okay.
[113:27.27]Um.
[113:27.37]20 luck.
[113:39.67]I have multiple crunchies.
[113:40.93]What do you think?
[113:55.48]Dexterity?
[113:57.88]If I'm going to be using quick, fast daggers, it has to be dexterity.
[114:02.18]Dexterity, luck.
[114:04.79]Or vitality.
[114:15.51]Luck only?
[114:16.09]Um... No, let's do health.
[114:17.99]Alright, now I'm gonna go fight wherever the hell that thing is.
[114:23.51]Okay.
[114:35.26]And then it was... This way?
[114:41.06]Right?
[114:42.34]And then...
[114:53.53]Found it.
[115:07.40]Well, that's absolutely a boss.
[115:14.56]Are we knocking?
[115:16.92]Shit.
[115:24.42]Hey!
[115:28.90]Swing!
[115:33.66]Oh my god.
[115:42.62]What?
[115:51.46]A hero will come.
[115:53.32]A hero will come.
[115:56.65]Leave my door.
[115:58.93]A hero will come.
[116:00.75]They almost just killed me.
[116:02.81]A hero did come, but not the one you wanted.
[116:13.58]Was that slaughter I heard?
[116:17.16]Oh, how my beloveds used to slaughter so...
[116:24.02]Who is there?
[116:26.22]Be you a hero.
[116:28.20]My beloved.
[116:33.14]One's in the chat if you know what that is.
[116:35.63]Friend ahead, okay.
[116:36.87]No, no, no.
[116:38.01]I cannot let you in.
[116:39.69]I love you too much.
[116:41.43]My everything, my stars.
[116:44.17]We cannot risk it.
[116:46.11]No, no, no.
[116:47.67]Unless...
[116:50.24]Should you come upon something with which I could restrain myself in your presence, a manacle or a shackle of some fidelity, bring it to me so I shan't ruin you unduly.
[117:06.37]Then I would open my door and serve you.
[117:12.20]What?
[117:13.52]No, no, no.
[117:14.20]Bring then.
[117:14.88]What?
[117:21.93]How about I just put a fucking landmine right here?
[117:37.54]Why would you do that?
[117:38.20]I don't know.
[117:45.64]Ooh, the smith's hammer.
[117:47.28]Such ruin.
[117:49.59]Such waste.
[117:52.35]What did you find?
[118:00.90]Are you a hero?
[118:03.44]I'm an apprentice smith, or I was meant to be.
[118:07.64]I've sought some memory of Nostalgai's craft and tradition, but all I've found is forgotten.
[118:14.14]With no masters to teach me, I'll never become a smith.
[118:21.19]But you could work on my gear.
[118:22.59]Hmm.
[118:23.09]It can remember.
[118:54.61]Remember overhead smash increased damage to armored.
[119:02.11]Oh, can you use this now?
[119:12.10]Jesus.
[119:14.48]Ow.
[119:20.91]Hmm.
[119:52.36]Okay.
[119:54.88]The smith's hammer is the greatest relic of Nostalgia's craftsfolk, transcending all who swing it.
[120:01.76]It's the primordial repository of our art.
[120:04.50]Such legacy.
[120:05.86]Of course, it still clings to some memory.
[120:10.32]Throughout the cycles, each of Nostalgia's masters wielded the hammer to enhance relics for our heroes.
[120:16.36]I've always longed to be a smith, to be a part of that.
[120:23.44]Angles?
[120:25.38]Lore.
[120:25.72]Wait, it's the same.
[120:26.58]Hold on.
[120:26.80]My- Oh, I- Ha ha ha ha.
[120:54.55]It's the same, right?
[120:57.56]Oh, no, the chuckle is at the end.
[121:01.26]It's part of the last... Oh, it's different.
[121:03.42]It is different.
[121:03.98]Okay, well.
[121:12.02]Sliver of tradition.
[121:14.46]You can do it.
[121:15.49]Try love.
[121:34.97]Alright.
[121:38.81]Try patience.
[121:43.15]How much do you stop?
[121:43.98]Alright, this thing's gonna move, right?
[121:55.74]We all know it.
[121:56.92]Consider remembering.
[122:00.47]Meat.
[122:00.57]Meat.
[122:07.71]Fully heal health and cure all status ailments.
[122:11.05]This thing is shaking.
[122:15.20]Remember.
[122:22.98]Ooh.
[122:28.07]Wait, we have lore.
[122:29.19]I'm going to read it.
[122:31.50]The NPC anti-heroes built barbaric pits where they fought one another to the death.
[122:37.58]Their aspiration was to rise above the heroes they'd grown to hate, to strip away the weakness which had kept them subservient and save the world themselves.
[122:47.47]They called their champions potheads due to their distinct armor.
[122:51.58]The anti-hero Brendan Merkle was the only known NPC to single-handedly slay heroes.
[122:57.71]Unlike the other potheads, he donned the armor of his victims.
[123:01.99]I could still feel my hero's blood congealing in me while Brendan Merkle slipped me on.
[123:11.87]Jesus.
[123:12.97]Whoa!
[123:14.77]Whoa!
[123:15.23]Look, look, look, look, look!
[123:16.29]Look it!
[123:17.17]I'm like a person!
[123:18.73]What?! !
[123:20.07]Holy shit!
[123:20.81]That's an- Okay, that was actually a pretty cool reveal.
[123:23.43]What?!
[123:37.20]He's a real boy!
[123:40.80]Very cool.
[123:41.92]Alright.
[123:42.88]Yeah!
[123:43.56]Alright, let's go!
[123:45.78]It's a full set bonus.
[123:46.80]You actually look normal.
[123:51.07]That's pretty cool.
[123:52.29]I'm not gonna lie.
[124:01.24]Take the armor off.
[124:02.04]Uh, let's find out.
[124:05.74]Yeah, so if I take a piece off... Like... Ah...
[124:17.85]Yeah, it's all kind of pixely.
[124:19.49]When you complete it, it turns into like a 3D game.
[124:24.79]See how these are kind of low fidelity?
[124:28.51]This whole outfit was low fidelity until I completed it.
[124:32.63]It's a metaphor.
[124:33.39]Cool.
[124:45.58]I gotta remember, so then the world can look like a 3D game.
[124:48.34]Not gonna lie, that's kind of freaking pog.
[125:14.71]I don't have any heals.
[125:21.47]Oh, fuck you.
[125:22.81]I gotta make it count right now?
[125:25.32]God damn it.
[125:26.68]That's alright.
[125:27.14]It's alright.
[125:29.28]Shit.
[125:39.15]Mind your tongue, one who lacks peanut allergy.
[125:50.20]Why did you say it like that?
[125:51.34]That's just a weird way to say that.
[125:56.56]Mind your tongue.
[126:01.17]Alright, let's get back over there.
[126:15.32]That was kind of a long ways away.
[126:27.71]Okay.
[126:29.94]Don't freak out.
[126:39.78]I gotta get better at that, because this whole class is about parrying and backstabs and crits.
[126:46.80]I gotta be better at that.
[126:48.00]That's how I'm gonna get any kills at all.
[127:00.08]Okay.
[127:03.14]Come on, do it.
[127:04.58]Do it!
[127:15.07]Good.
[127:16.92]Anybody behind here?
[127:22.46]Got it.
[127:24.50]You can do well, too.
[127:25.26]It's good to know.
[127:40.41]Chester trust.
[127:43.37]Loaded die.
[127:44.25]Alright, something bad down here.
[127:56.50]Blue Jerry wall.
[128:09.82]Somebody's behind me.
[128:17.91]Right behind.
[128:18.41]What?
[128:29.18]Just use the Zwiander.
[128:30.44]I think that's it.
[128:40.54]What's going on?
[128:56.53]They were all following me from before, I guess.
[129:33.30]Barnacles.
[129:33.92]This guy is good.
[129:40.68]These unstable pixel doors.
[129:42.40]I wonder what that means.
[129:52.13]Legend of Independence.
[130:10.30]Ugly thing.
[130:11.84]What?
[130:13.62]Who rated that good?
[130:16.00]Ugly thing.
[130:23.64]What was that?
[130:27.51]That was very weird.
[130:28.23]Okay.
[130:36.09]I'm very far right now.
[130:37.35]I do not want to die.
[130:38.31]I'm gonna play like a coward.
[130:53.07]Something written.
[130:53.59]Nice.
[130:59.45]Betray.
[131:01.09]Betrayed?
[131:01.69]Are these scripted messages?
[131:07.92]No, I don't think so.
[131:23.34]This is bait.
[131:55.49]Was that a bad idea?
[132:04.72]I don't know.
[132:05.05]I don't know, I never played this before.
[132:22.70]ugly thing no I'm gonna say um a bunch of swears oh okay how about um consider consider uh consider a concept
[133:09.52]Any tiny cardboard box This is aggro range
[133:32.06]Forgotten knight armor?
[133:39.12]This relic's memory has been forgotten.
[133:47.89]So I can't do anything about that?
[133:49.13]I don't know.
[133:56.45]Maybe some things you just can't do.
[134:01.14]They have no memory.
[134:01.98]Alright, here's the... Alright, I gotta remember this.
[134:05.04]This is the shortcut.
[134:11.91]Hahaha!
[134:38.07]That was cute.
[134:46.09]Making sure.
[134:49.35]Oh, fuck.
[134:49.89]Okay.
[134:50.35]Parry, parry, parry, parry, parry.
[134:54.61]I'm gonna die in one fucking hit.
[135:02.66]Jesus.
[135:03.05]I have a lot of souls.
[135:12.34]Okay.
[135:24.17]Ah!
[135:36.97]Nope.
[135:52.78]What?
[135:53.28]Oh, it's gonna explode.
[135:54.22]Alright, this looks like progress.
[136:05.33]Do I want to drop down here, though?
[136:08.76]I guess, over that way?
[136:10.22]Whatever, I'm going for it.
[136:13.92]Have I not been... How did I not get this?
[136:17.90]Caliber of Memory.
[136:19.58]Oh, shit.
[136:27.57]Fuck you.
[136:33.19]Flow State entered.
[136:36.77]I wonder what that means.
[136:37.39]More damage or something?
[136:46.37]Okay.
[136:58.76]This guy's wearing pots and pans.
[137:10.16]dead god damn it I got killed by the guy with a pod on his head I was so big all right that's six thousand souls I don't want to lose that okay I opened up a new place there was a new place I opened I think it's up here
[137:44.74]Where was it?
[137:47.10]And then... I don't really remember.
[137:48.84]I'm probably going the long way, but... It's alright.
[138:11.50]I did not go in these...
[138:16.87]Oh, fuck.
[138:18.63]Big mistake.
[138:35.93]Get it!
[138:36.79]Did I get it?
[138:37.43]Nope.
[138:37.67]Alright, that's better.
[138:50.23]Shit, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[139:15.55]Uh, the door was...
[139:18.47]I don't remember.
[139:20.52]Oh wait, it's this guy.
[139:27.08]I gotta get better at parrying.
[139:30.64]Truly fucking awful at this game.
[139:33.05]At the parrying aspect of it.
[139:35.35]Alright, this is the smith.
[139:42.36]And then it was up and around.
[139:51.46]Because I opened the door up here, right?
[139:54.50]Or no, did I?
[139:57.62]I'm in the right vicinity, I know that.
[140:01.27]Look at your souls.
[140:02.79]Yeah, I'm making my way over there.
[140:25.74]Better.
[140:34.07]Better.
[140:34.33]Okay.
[140:40.93]Almost there.
[140:42.74]This was a huge backtrack, and I'm really not happy about it.
[140:46.10]At all.
[140:48.62]But, I'm almost there.
[140:52.08]There's definitely a door I could have just gone in, but whatever.
[141:13.94]Alright, here we are.
[141:19.67]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[141:20.79]Let's go.
[141:23.03]I went in here.
[141:23.67]I went across.
[141:28.71]And then the guy with the pot on his head killed me.
[141:36.68]Shit.
[141:42.85]Okay.
[141:45.13]Don't screw this up.
[141:51.42]Where was it?
[141:56.26]Shit, I'm confused now.
[141:58.70]Was it through here?
[141:59.40]I'm in the right vicinity.
[142:07.13]I just don't know exactly where I need to go.
[142:11.09]Was it actually across the bridge?
[142:27.10]I think this is accurate.
[142:29.97]Yep.
[142:30.49]Okay, good.
[142:36.80]God damn it.
[143:01.55]All right.
[143:02.85]Round two.
[143:03.59]Let's go.
[143:26.26]Anti-hero pothead.
[143:37.81]This relic is part of a set.
[143:40.25]Okay, so this is part of a set.
[143:43.59]7.8, 1.6.
[143:44.25]Am I fat rolling?
[143:50.48]Because it looks kind of funny.
[144:00.24]Wait a minute.
[144:02.18]Aha!
[144:04.76]I knew I... Wait, that's not even the shovel.
[144:12.74]Wait.
[144:13.86]It costs money to do some of these?
[144:25.33]Do it.
[144:26.79]I mean, I guess it just does scale with dexterity.
[144:29.55]I'll do it.
[144:29.89]First damage to evil.
[144:42.08]Hmm.
[144:50.46]Let's try it.
[144:53.40]66 plus 63.
[144:57.82]Ooh, that's not good at all.
[144:59.00]93 plus 67 versus 66.
[145:03.31]This is way worse.
[145:04.23]Should I try it?
[145:22.47]It's a really good scaling weapon.
[145:25.73]Yeah.
[145:26.21]If I had more decks, maybe it'd be cool.
[145:27.47]But, nope.
[145:29.33]Still cool, though.
[145:35.17]Got good range.
[145:37.27]What the fuck is that?
[145:45.00]Uh... Okay.
[145:46.74]Okay.
[145:47.37]Golly gosh, look at you.
[145:49.55]You really are retro, huh?
[145:52.70]Neat.
[145:53.54]I'm the reservoir of pain.
[145:55.96]Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
[145:59.23]It's difficult to know who you can trust.
[146:02.15]I get that.
[146:03.23]Cryptic old men who can't remember their purpose.
[146:07.11]Forgotten relics wailing on about their tortured memories.
[146:12.18]And nobody telling you exactly what to do.
[146:15.28]You've been left to figure things out for yourself.
[146:18.68]and that's terrible so let me help nostal guy was a gauntlet where heroes I want to r1 so bad suffer a bit unfortunately and then sacrifice themselves back to the world's heart so that new stories could begin these new stories were inspired by what came before
[146:42.06]They built on the beauty of the past.
[146:45.84]But heroes quit letting go.
[146:48.40]They grew obsessed with maintaining their dominance, living their own legacies.
[146:53.92]And without new inspiration, Nostalgaia is being forgotten.
[146:59.17]Anyhoo, if selfish heroes won't give themselves back willingly, a real hero will have to make them let go.
[147:06.75]Then Nostalgaia's heart will open again.
[147:18.43]The first great one chokes Nostalgaia from the depths of... Oh!
[147:31.26]Oh!
[147:31.54]Oh!
[147:31.87]Oh!
[147:35.37]Oh!
[147:43.79]Oh no, he likes it!
[147:45.13]Oh, fuck you!
[147:45.37]Oh my god.
[147:45.89]Alright, I'm leaving.
[148:17.40]I'm gonna leave now.
[148:23.82]I'm gonna leave now.
[148:25.10]I thought I could kill it.
[148:26.48]Gold shortage hunters wanted.
[148:49.56]Okay.
[148:55.92]I got a lot of stuff.
[148:59.38]Wait!
[149:02.08]I can bring that back to that, uh, that guy.
[149:06.06]Oh, it's happiness.
[149:18.11]I can't.
[149:18.72]Okay.
[149:20.46]This is important.
[149:21.94]What do I level up here?
[149:27.06]Dex, probably right.
[149:30.17]Ooh, new luck ability.
[149:31.81]Dex and luck.
[149:34.49]And it's an anvil.
[149:55.62]Whoa You found a workable anvil this forge used to refine the ore extracted from nostalgias mines Mostly theatrics really for the sake of you and yours, but some materials were used for meaningful things like improving our heroes arms Took pride in our work back then No sign of a master Smith well
[150:17.58]I have some crude skills.
[150:19.06]I'll aid you.
[150:20.04]Best I can, hero.
[150:22.02]Okay.
[150:22.80]Own weapons.
[150:26.32]A sliver of tradition.
[150:28.43]Oh, shit.
[150:29.69]I have to actually think about this.
[150:32.09]It's probably this one.
[150:35.39]Right?
[150:37.11]I feel like it's that one.
[150:43.02]The voice acting is legit good.
[150:45.24]It is, yeah.
[150:48.06]What about infuse?
[150:52.74]So I can infuse this with the Legend of Independence.
[150:57.32]Independent Edge of Entropy.
[150:59.76]214.
[151:00.76]That's better, but... I'm going to go for this.
[151:14.79]I feel like this thing's pretty good.
[151:20.00]It makes it pure with no scaling.
[151:24.06]This is just way better, so I'm going to stick with this.
[151:26.96]I mean, this is the other one that probably is pretty good, but I'm going to go with this.
[151:35.49]Okay, I need three of those to get it higher.
[151:40.75]Do the halberd, too.
[151:44.26]Eventually, this might be really good with the scaling.
[151:45.98]I'm going to hold on for now.
[151:48.39]if you find another anvil especially with a master smith remember to summon me there too okay uh yep all right 15 decks I think is good I'll stop there we'll get vitality stamina to 15 and then luck to 25.
[152:21.00]Go do the shackle quest.
[152:22.86]All right.
[152:23.50]Can I teleport?
[152:27.94]Tether warp.
[152:29.23]I mean, this is going to bring me... Hmm.
[152:37.83]I definitely want to keep it here.
[152:38.65]All right.
[152:44.69]Time for me to work backwards.
[152:46.03]Good luck.
[152:46.97]Because I don't remember anything that just happened.
[152:51.86]I remember going this way.
[152:53.06]And now I don't.
[152:55.41]Alright, I'm gonna go check out that NPC.
[153:11.98]What is this?
[153:12.48]Can I open that?
[153:13.42]Okay, this is locked.
[153:15.08]It's, like, glitched out.
[153:15.92]I remember this.
[153:16.84]Oh, I can take it!
[153:18.66]Oh!
[153:19.93]Yep, okay.
[153:22.13]Uh, drop down?
[153:22.73]Sure.
[153:28.70]Alright, where was that guy?
[153:36.28]Over there.
[153:48.68]That's doing 533 damage.
[153:56.70]Okay, we gotta go across.
[154:00.66]I don't know.
[154:09.54]Is it gonna kill me?
[154:11.59]No.
[154:14.79]Alright, where... This guy's right here somewhere, right?
[154:19.22]Alright, are you ready?
[154:20.28]I don't know if I want this person to hang out with me.
[154:30.30]Okay.
[154:52.45]ah my hero you got like traps in here or something I'm gonna get killed or something welcome to my shop it's a shopkeeper I have long longed for you my radiates we all did
[155:19.27]Once, I wish you could experience the parades and feasts we held in your honor.
[155:26.49]Banner maidens and clamoring children all thronging the streets to glimpse our salvation.
[155:33.94]Our markets overflowing with the bounty each hero's deeds had brought us.
[155:39.50]That was enough.
[155:41.36]But we have forgotten.
[155:44.30]I must never unbind myself in your presence, my everything.
[155:48.08]For should the great forgetting take me, I could not bear that these pixels I was should turn ravenous upon you.
[155:57.33]Ooh, what is this shit?
[156:10.90]You can be a caster.
[156:12.00]That's right.
[156:12.78]That's cool.
[156:13.64]Should I buy any of this?
[156:14.80]Vibrating sword.
[156:22.74]This thing's kind of cool looking.
[156:25.48]Deck scaling.
[156:27.54]Noble E. Peen.
[156:34.69]Is this a spell?
[156:36.27]No, this is... No, it is a spell.
[156:37.95]I kind of want this.
[156:46.57]It's not that expensive either.
[156:48.87]Hold on.
[156:53.00]I'm gonna get it.
[156:53.40]Okay.
[156:58.87]I want it.
[156:59.35]Let me have it.
[157:00.09]Oh, one of these, too.
[157:00.71]Torch?
[157:00.87]Maybe I should get the torch.
[157:21.43]This thing's ready to get... Oh, it's in here.
[157:27.03]Thousand?
[157:27.73]Alright, hold on.
[157:28.31]Let's go for it.
[157:44.22]Remember.
[157:45.36]Thousand.
[157:54.60]Frit damage up in offhand.
[157:59.80]Wait, by how much?
[158:18.00]Do welding.
[158:23.48]I'll rock this for a little while.
[158:32.32]The rest of this stuff I'll probably have to come back for.
[158:34.14]I don't really know what it's... I know what this is for, but... Maybe I should get the torch.
[158:38.92]I'm probably going to be pissed if I don't buy this.
[158:41.86]You know in an hour I'm going to be like, I was right there, I had an opportunity, and I didn't do it.
[158:51.47]Does this thing vibrate?
[158:52.19]No.
[158:52.37]Okay.
[158:57.99]Okay.
[159:01.45]That was cool.
[159:02.03]It was worth coming back here for.
[159:02.91]I could upgrade this too.
[159:05.23]Alright, I'm gonna upgrade this.
[159:15.57]Uh, hold on.
[159:21.35]I feel like I could just die and just wake up at that bonfire.
[159:26.38]Let me test this out.
[159:31.86]Alright, I actually like it.
[159:34.98]This is way, way cooler than what I was doing before.
[159:41.66]Alright.
[159:42.56]Um... What's the fa- The fastest way is probably just to go backwards.
[159:54.27]Right.
[159:55.57]And just teleport to the bonfire.
[160:15.80]Uh, it's like right here.
[160:17.51]It's like over here, right?
[160:18.69]I don't remember.
[160:27.76]No, it's not.
[160:28.50]It's back.
[160:30.84]Um, just kill me.
[160:33.00]Just kill me.
[160:33.82]Just kill me.
[160:34.56]If there's more than two layers to a level, I will forget where I am every time.
[160:45.81]If your game has three layers, one of them is always gone.
[160:52.25]It could be the middle layer.
[160:53.53]It could be the top layer.
[160:54.57]It could be the bottom layer.
[160:55.59]One of them is gone, no matter what.
[160:58.49]It always happens to me.
[161:00.87]All right, let me upgrade this.
[161:01.95]Ooh.
[161:03.70]Yeah.
[161:15.39]Hopefully this wasn't a bad decision.
[161:17.89]All right, let's go.
[161:25.05]Check over here.
[161:30.80]Now, is there a jump?
[161:39.44]No.
[161:40.84]Uh, but hold on.
[161:42.92]Is that bad?
[161:48.52]Yeah, it's bad.
[162:12.77]Why are you using rivers of blood?
[162:14.27]Because it's good.
[162:25.56]How come you don't do the ool ool ool anymore?
[162:28.26]Because I... We might have to have another kill the meme stream.
[162:39.87]I'm telling you.
[162:40.35]Do you remember that?
[162:45.09]I keep seeing a lot of similar memes show up.
[162:47.69]And, you know, it's time to kill the fucking meme.
[162:50.81]I think we got to do another one.
[163:00.45]80% of everybody here does not remember that.
[163:03.73]Yeah, I mean, I'm starting to see some of the same jokes.
[163:08.81]Right?
[163:10.60]It might be time.
[163:12.26]It might be time.
[163:15.02]And I'm at fault of this too.
[163:24.96]What about Scorn?
[163:25.84]You can't kill Scorn.
[163:27.01]No, I don't think Scorn is a part of this.
[163:33.25]Where did I go?
[163:45.74]Oh.
[163:52.24]Is this...
[163:56.80]Where are we going?
[164:00.52]Memes have an expiration date.
[164:01.71]It'll happen naturally.
[164:04.55]It depends on what it is.
[164:05.35]Alright, so this is... Alright, where am I now?
[164:18.69]This is back in the beginning.
[164:19.95]This is that undead berg area.
[164:24.27]So I don't really want to be... No, I don't want to be here.
[164:36.02]They get unfunny, then become legacy memes, and then are funny again.
[164:40.67]I think after the Kill the Meme stream, I think there was a lot of people that really came up with a lot of new stuff.
[164:49.30]Because of that.
[164:54.78]Shit.
[164:56.40]I mean, I guess I'm going over there.
[165:06.62]I just got magnetized to the ground.
[165:28.41]Whoa, lacking any depth of its own.
[165:31.17]The sticks began poking into the depths of our world.
[165:35.73]Rude.
[165:45.08]Is this like bad what I'm doing?
[165:51.16]Why do they have that in over their heads?
[166:03.13]Oh, they're kobolds.
[166:05.58]I get it, okay.
[166:22.59]Friend, curiosity.
[166:35.17]Memory of an inanimate object.
[166:50.14]Try patience.
[166:54.92]People are saying, stop, stop, stop.
[166:56.43]This is 200 experience every time.
[166:59.03]Hold on, wait.
[166:59.59]Remembrance?
[167:03.97]No.
[167:09.99]What does that mean?
[167:12.96]Wait, now they're in a different mode?
[167:26.87]This offhanded weapon is... I'm never going to take this off.
[167:29.43]This thing is so good.
[167:32.23]Extra crit, too.
[167:44.51]Oh, you have a lot of health.
[168:12.92]What is that?
[168:17.64]strength heavy prying tool strength weapon it's the half-life crowbar what does this one say it's probably really funny actually kind of funny
[168:56.06]One hit.
[168:58.22]Try rushing.
[168:58.94]Alright, actually be careful.
[169:02.00]I'll have a try rushing and then try patience.
[169:17.51]What was that?
[169:18.70]Okay, it's fine.
[169:26.92]What did you hit me with?
[169:29.70]I'm out of stamina.
[169:32.21]Don't do it.
[169:32.83]Okay.
[169:35.51]I need... Where is it?
[169:36.85]I know I have like two of them, right?
[169:50.65]Shit!
[169:51.61]I thought I got it off.
[169:52.33]I thought I killed him.
[169:55.16]Damn it.
[170:01.89]It yelled like I do when I have a bug on me.
[170:07.17]Gold coins.
[170:10.29]Ow.
[170:11.47]Just like a marker.
[170:12.21]Twitch should censor the word poop.
[170:26.92]What?
[170:29.16]It's not stable.
[170:34.93]I can't open it.
[170:49.52]This is locked.
[170:50.24]Well, that's creepy.
[171:06.67]Was there another way to go?
[171:07.67]Is that it?
[171:10.43]Suddenly a fire erupted to burn the kindling down.
[171:14.05]This is going to be a hard poll, so.
[171:22.30]Do not fuck this up.
[171:28.16]Somebody's running.
[171:57.52]I don't have any more heals either.
[171:58.58]This is going to be a pain in the ass.
[172:03.22]Come here.
[172:12.95]Thank God.
[172:13.63]I think he would like a hundred gecks.
[172:26.52]We've listened to that on stream before.
[172:39.01]Gold coins.
[172:44.58]I didn't think he was going to turn around that quick.
[172:47.36]I thought he was busy mining.
[173:00.07]chain mail what is this damage that bounces between enemies send out some loaded correspondence that damages one enemy and then gets sent to additional enemies that's funny
[173:37.21]I really don't want to blow this.
[173:40.07]And I'm probably going to.
[173:40.79]But whatever.
[173:42.07]Falling R1?
[173:47.76]No.
[174:10.20]Please don't.
[174:11.14]I don't want to do this again.
[174:16.24]Just turn around and run.
[174:17.40]Oh my god, this is a wall.
[174:21.11]Do I have any heals?
[174:27.33]I just probably woke somebody up.
[174:28.17]I'm sorry.
[174:35.14]Jesus, thank god.
[174:43.24]I don't have any heals.
[174:56.35]Remember, my newborn is crying.
[174:58.65]Well, go take care of your baby!
[175:04.27]Why are you writing that here?
[175:10.75]Hey, just want to let you know, my newborn's crying.
[175:14.13]Chat, what should I do?
[175:29.78]I don't know.
[175:30.06]Is the baby hungry?
[175:30.84]Is the baby tired?
[175:33.52]I don't know anything about you or your life.
[175:36.98]I have no idea who you even are.
[175:38.94]I don't have any advice for your baby.
[175:53.12]You've got a magical enchanted pickaxe.
[175:56.10]This is some Minecraft shit right here, and he's going to kill me in one hit.
[176:00.81]Swing!
[176:03.18]Swing it!
[176:04.00]Swing it, please!
[176:06.08]Fuck you!
[176:06.86]Oh my god.
[176:08.20]Oh no.
[176:10.74]That was a weird animation.
[176:12.08]I don't know where this is!
[176:14.56]Shit.
[176:20.36]No, no, no, no.
[176:20.94]I do, I do.
[176:21.42]I know where this is.
[176:21.98]I know where this is.
[176:28.39]I know where that is.
[176:39.99]Be remembered ahead.
[176:41.01]All right, we got to go all the freaking way.
[176:46.15]Where was it?
[176:48.52]This way or that way?
[176:50.36]God, all the freaking way.
[176:52.06]Where was it?
[177:05.66]This is the wrong way, isn't it?
[177:09.45]This is the wrong way, isn't it?
[177:44.49]Alright, come on.
[177:45.01]Do you have any tips?
[177:47.33]I just started the game.
[177:48.91]Um, it's pretty fun.
[177:50.99]It's, it's, I would, hold on.
[177:52.29]I, okay.
[178:02.80]It's, yes.
[178:10.94]Do you have any tips?
[178:13.39]It's fun.
[178:15.93]Yeah, that was not a good tip.
[178:17.63]I apologize for that bad tip.
[178:24.16]I'll give you a real tip, though.
[178:27.08]Dodge rolling is your friend.
[178:29.06]Hey, dodge rolling is your friend.
[178:49.94]I'm stuck.
[179:07.94]It's the wrong fucking way.
[179:09.78]It's the wrong way.
[179:16.14]Well, I have to kill everything now.
[179:25.98]I went the wrong way.
[179:26.92]It's left instead of right.
[179:39.13]Go up that... I'm just going to say stupid, but you go up there and just go left straight.
[179:45.17]Do not go right.
[179:47.49]Right leads you to the bottom of that thing.
[179:49.35]Okay.
[179:55.38]Move.
[180:03.10]That was absolute bullshit.
[180:20.41]All right, this way.
[180:21.03]All right, then we go here.
[180:33.92]Yep.
[180:35.00]Alright, this is new shit.
[180:50.53]Swing!
[180:51.07]What the hell was that?
[181:09.30]Oh.
[181:10.16]Okay.
[181:17.45]I gotta pull you over here.
[181:21.47]Oh, goddammit.
[181:23.07]Sorry.
[181:28.45]One little piece of shit of life.
[181:35.93]Don't kill me!
[181:50.99]Chill, man.
[181:51.79]It's stressful.
[181:52.67]What do you mean chill?
[182:04.03]We're good.
[182:08.98]Okay.
[182:13.14]So I was down there.
[182:25.25]You're going to cast that bullshit.
[182:27.73]Everyone's going to run down this hall.
[182:28.85]I don't want to fight in the water either.
[182:43.02]Rooting voice potion?
[183:08.37]Oh, nice.
[183:08.77]A green herb.
[183:12.17]I have never seen a squirrel in real life.
[183:16.65]You haven't?
[183:17.87]I mean, that's not that weird.
[183:19.47]I don't know what part of the world you're from.
[183:22.89]Where in the world are there no squirrels?
[183:38.94]Okay, this is a conversation that I need to not pay attention to.
[183:42.16]Yeah, squirrels are... Kind of interesting, I guess.
[184:11.89]Are there any squirrels in Vegas?
[184:14.09]I think so.
[184:16.63]I don't know.
[184:18.45]I think so, but I can't tell you.
[184:25.25]I've really, I haven't really seen any squirrels.
[184:38.19]Squirrels.
[184:40.75]Maybe.
[184:42.61]Something I didn't put into my memory bank.
[184:47.39]This is a dangerous room.
[184:48.33]I don't know.
[184:50.11]There are two NPCs.
[184:50.71]I might have to fight these people.
[185:17.35]Hello?
[185:20.59]You don't look like the forgotten we've been slaughtering.
[185:24.06]Don't look like much of anything.
[185:27.08]Like we should criticize?
[185:29.91]True, true.
[185:31.19]What a ridiculously rendered three are we.
[185:34.41]Take our company, friend.
[185:36.37]I call myself Nameless Nero.
[185:39.81]My companion is the lady Sko-Pikat.
[185:42.37]Just Sko, please.
[185:44.33]Nero's titles don't fit.
[185:46.95]We are pondering a most dubious task.
[185:49.85]A quest, I like to think.
[185:51.82]We don't have to be reckless to prove our worth.
[185:55.68]Ah, but we must when the world is filled... Assassin's Creed Unity, girl.
[186:02.10]That's funny.
[186:03.10]I can see the latent heroism in their stature.
[186:06.89]Not unlike my own.
[186:08.53]Would you help us, stranger?
[186:10.97]This quest might give my friend the value he needs.
[186:14.73]Shhh.
[186:15.09]Rally your bravery, sko.
[186:18.12]I do not need aid, but I welcome a compatriot always.
[186:22.57]I'll do it.
[186:24.13]There is a creature down this corridor that seems not of this story.
[186:29.15]The lady is fascinated.
[186:31.03]While I see cause to vanquish without question.
[186:34.11]That it is evil is a thing we agree upon wholeheartedly.
[186:37.97]So, I give you this quest.
[186:40.82]What about- I don't have any heals.
[186:42.40]Let's go!
[186:43.32]You can do it!
[186:44.28]Suddenly victory!
[187:09.69]Holy shit.
[187:10.45]What is this?
[187:11.75]Alright, you guys fight it.
[187:15.33]That hurt a lot.
[187:24.84]Help them.
[187:25.24]Do you understand these spells I'm casting?
[187:37.33]We did it.
[187:38.60]arachnid stinger we did it we we did it we're incredible in nameless nero you have made an ally henceforth our paths towards heroism are entwined it's gonna make me laugh every time for I have no doubt oh
[188:05.68]I know it was a quest, but I didn't really plan a reward.
[188:14.36]It's not much, but it is a token of my esteem.
[188:18.54]We shall be the forms the future follows.
[188:24.02]That sucked.
[188:25.27]I feel bigger.
[188:26.87]May we meet again, my friend.
[188:30.32]That's a way better reward than yours.
[188:56.45]What was that creature?
[188:58.09]The pieces do not fit.
[189:02.39]What was that?
[189:02.89]I feel me.
[189:04.29]Alright, what else?
[189:05.53]Anything else down here?
[189:07.15]Wait.
[189:08.05]Important, right?
[189:09.13]Hold on.
[189:09.53]Torch.
[189:12.77]Maybe?
[189:12.97]Maybe?
[189:15.39]No?
[189:18.85]Maybe?
[189:19.19]Nope.
[189:27.69]I did get some new weapon, though.
[189:28.93]What was that?
[189:33.45]Strength.
[189:41.25]Always check.
[189:43.74]Anything is vibrating.
[189:47.72]Down here, no.
[189:48.48]That's pretty cool.
[189:53.54]Alright, goodbye.
[189:53.92]Okay.
[190:00.10]I thought this game was going to be a 45 minute joke game, but this is actually cool as hell.
[190:06.20]I would very much agree with you.
[190:09.42]This has just been sitting in my Steam.
[190:13.24]I've just been waiting to play it.
[190:16.59]Just like, oh yeah, okay, so I mentioned this months and months ago.
[190:20.15]I just had it in my Steam library.
[190:26.59]And I told you guys before,
[190:30.14]There's not gonna be like, oh, should I play that today?
[190:33.23]Am I gonna play that tonight?
[190:35.33]Eh, maybe another night.
[190:36.11]Meh, I don't know.
[190:36.97]Might not be any good.
[190:38.71]No, we're in a new era.
[190:41.17]A new era of just play anything.
[190:43.75]And who cares?
[190:44.59]Wow.
[190:45.61]Wow.
[190:55.48]Double swing?
[190:56.36]Really?
[190:57.00]Why am I not swinging with this other weapon?
[191:03.64]Shit.
[191:07.68]Alright.
[191:08.81]That looks pretty cool.
[191:11.61]Shaking.
[191:14.09]Wait, what kind of gear is this?
[191:15.77]This is way too heavy.
[191:33.54]Is it too heavy?
[191:34.08]I mean, in fat rolling.
[191:40.18]Might as well just do it.
[191:41.26]Why not?
[191:42.00]Very cool.
[191:45.22]Ancient alloy.
[191:46.07]2,000.
[191:47.71]Fine.
[191:58.93]Oh, look it.
[192:00.31]It looks cool now.
[192:13.99]I still haven't unlocked this one yet either.
[192:21.66]That's pretty cool.
[192:27.54]I gotta keep this on.
[192:28.70]I guess I can keep the pants on, right?
[192:32.48]Yeah.
[192:33.82]I like that look.
[192:41.32]I don't want to blow this.
[192:42.39]I very much could.
[192:43.45]I need to go game progress route.
[192:47.15]I don't know where that is.
[192:48.09]Kind of turned around here.
[192:57.98]This looks accurate.
[192:59.00]I guess that's what the gold coins are for.
[193:15.50]Oh my god.
[193:33.16]Swing already!
[193:33.98]You're driving me crazy!
[193:44.78]Swing already.
[193:45.43]You're driving me crazy.
[193:46.73]I'm not fucking around.
[194:05.68]Sorry.
[194:08.44]Not messing around.
[194:09.34]I have no health.
[194:11.73]You think I'm going to find my way back to this place?
[194:15.04]You're dreaming.
[194:27.23]Exploding... Whatever that is.
[194:46.35]Now he's being serious?
[194:48.05]Yeah, because do you see how far down I am?
[194:50.33]I don't remember how I got here.
[194:58.66]You kill me through the door, I'm going to be very upset about it.
[195:17.07]Can I close the door?
[195:17.93]I'm dead.
[195:20.08]I am dead here.
[195:45.47]He turned around so quickly.
[195:46.99]I thought I had, like, another half second.
[195:48.73]Uh-oh.
[195:55.84]The shrine was right there.
[195:57.28]Ugh!
[195:58.62]Alright.
[195:59.04]Good luck.
[196:21.53]Dude, that's mad embarrassing.
[196:30.13]It is embarrassing.
[196:30.89]Okay, then it was over here.
[196:37.66]And then over here.
[196:47.46]And then over here.
[196:52.57]And then this way.
[196:54.31]And then through here.
[196:59.64]And then down here.
[197:04.98]And then this way.
[197:12.25]And this way.
[197:17.67]And then down.
[197:22.03]Wait, there's this weird person down here.
[197:23.79]I forgot.
[197:24.39]Uh-oh.
[197:38.69]God!
[197:41.37]I'm down here with the fucking Minecraft guy.
[197:43.43]5,000 souls about to be deleted.
[197:55.37]Wait, I can cheese the hell out of this.
[197:59.85]Where are my weapons?
[198:00.99]Where are my... What's going on with my weapons?
[198:04.54]They're all getting... I was hoping just for a crit and just killed like three or four of them in a row.
[198:15.86]Fuck.
[198:16.62]Whatever.
[198:16.94]It's alright.
[198:17.92]It's alright.
[198:18.30]It's alright.
[198:18.56]It's alright.
[198:18.82]Don't worry.
[198:23.45]Shit.
[198:26.55]Shit.
[198:32.34]Minus 5k.
[198:33.18]It's alright.
[198:34.22]We'll get him back.
[198:34.64]That's bullshit.
[199:00.27]Alright, same deal.
[199:01.25]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[199:07.25]This time, it's... Is it this way instead?
[199:11.02]I think it's... Wait, I don't know.
[199:17.64]I went the same way.
[199:39.55]Alright, I killed the Minecraft character.
[199:42.66]Did that do anything?
[199:50.50]Nothing in the water or anything?
[199:54.58]Oh, shit.
[200:01.37]Uh...
[200:16.89]This is a shortcut.
[200:24.25]Yeah, right.
[200:25.19]I'm not going to remember what this is.
[200:26.33]I mean, I know it exists though.
[200:29.95]Hmm.
[200:52.92]I'm gonna aggro that thing behind me accidentally, aren't I?
[200:55.72]Okay.
[201:08.16]Friend?
[201:08.58]Foe?
[201:19.15]Oh!
[201:38.17]These, okay.
[201:41.11]Green herb.
[201:41.63]Do you have a shirt on?
[201:48.76]I'm not going to confirm or deny if I have any clothing on.
[201:52.10]Well, I do, but not... Consider... Wow, interesting.
[201:56.48]Minus two.
[201:56.94]Really?
[202:01.95]Really?
[202:19.54]I am so far gone at this point.
[202:22.52]I guess I'm gonna go over there.
[202:25.98]Padlock?
[202:33.87]There it is.
[202:34.21]Oh, this is it.
[202:35.95]I made it.
[202:36.53]I made it.
[202:36.79]I actually made it.
[202:37.31]Okay, cool.
[202:58.04]Uh-oh.
[203:02.56]I have no stamina.
[203:05.68]Ah!
[203:06.54]Fine.
[203:08.84]No, please!
[203:10.91]Please, please.
[203:12.57]No, please!
[203:13.21]Oh, this way.
[203:23.99]Oh, my goodness.
[203:24.77]Oh, my goodness.
[203:25.25]Touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it, quick!
[203:29.61]Sit at it, quick, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit.
[203:33.99]Sit.
[203:34.83]Sit!
[203:35.67]Sit!
[203:50.52]Can't attack them.
[203:53.64]I don't have a good opportunity.
[204:00.09]Oh, God.
[204:12.86]All right.
[204:28.48]Thank goodness.
[204:36.49]I definitely want more stamina.
[204:38.15]I can feel it.
[204:41.97]Tether it here.
[204:44.79]Now, I have a lot of crunchies.
[204:46.45]I think I'm going to use most of them.
[204:47.85]Yeah, let's use them all.
[204:56.29]500, that's it?
[204:57.39]That's nothing.
[205:05.92]That was a weird hiccup.
[205:11.28]Weapon upgrade.
[205:17.72]I don't see anything vibrating.
[205:23.83]Plus dexterity stuff.
[205:31.13]Marking yourself with this willing... Wait.
[205:38.71]What does this mean?
[205:40.53]Should I do this?
[205:46.02]I wonder if these are permanent.
[205:48.50]Or is it just for a short duration?
[205:50.68]I don't know.
[205:55.61]Okay.
[205:57.73]Kill on sight.
[206:04.31]So where is the right way?
[206:05.27]Up?
[206:05.37]Up?
[206:14.27]Up and around?
[206:14.79]Fuck you.
[206:46.60]Ooh, item.
[206:58.71]Leonard's lounge shorts.
[207:01.81]They just wear a pair of boxers?
[207:03.05]I mean, that's a comedy.
[207:23.70]This is a comedy item.
[207:24.66]Comedy items are fine.
[207:25.54]I'm going to go across.
[207:40.80]Can I even go across?
[207:51.51]Nope.
[207:53.30]Maybe I could fall.
[207:57.98]Put the bird armor on with the boxers.
[208:09.03]It's fat rolling still.
[208:11.43]Where is my weight?
[208:12.95]There it is.
[208:14.43]Load, 87%.
[208:14.81]I wonder how much you need to not fat roll.
[208:19.01]76, that's still fat rolling.
[208:22.99]37%?
[208:23.27]I think that's mid.
[208:38.32]I don't think... How much does this weigh?
[208:42.01]31.
[208:42.05]That's actually really heavy.
[208:42.81]61?
[208:42.83]Alright, 60%.
[208:45.25]I think it's 75%.
[208:52.78]What do you rate this out of 10?
[208:53.78]I think it's a little early to say that.
[208:57.02]Ooh, there's something else down there.
[209:10.97]Weird.
[209:11.25]Um, I definitely can't drop.
[209:23.10]What's the best way to go?
[209:23.98]I don't know.
[209:28.52]Is there like a better way to go?
[209:29.78]Hmm.
[209:46.51]You should be fine if you jump.
[209:48.79]Oh, it's down here.
[209:49.41]Right.
[209:57.38]Yeah.
[210:01.67]Patience.
[210:06.71]No, there's no way.
[210:09.75]I am absolutely dead.
[210:12.85]I'm dead, so might as well just laugh.
[210:15.47]And that was kind of funny.
[210:27.26]I can't do it.
[210:36.49]Oh, you actually can't do it.
[210:42.83]Why did I even come over here?
[210:53.17]Well, you actually can't do it.
[210:55.04]That person was right.
[211:00.67]Okay.
[211:03.21]So... Where is the right way to go?
[211:13.68]Down?
[211:14.30]And around?
[211:14.76]I don't know.
[211:22.16]Is there another... I can go in here.
[211:24.40]I think it's in here.
[211:44.54]No.
[211:54.79]Alright, deeper into the mine.
[211:55.81]Just swing with the offhand.
[212:06.63]Honestly.
[212:07.23]The offhand just does way more damage than the combo.
[212:12.30]Can you tell me the germ-a-meal?
[212:14.62]I want McDonald's.
[212:17.68]Grab yourself a McChicken.
[212:20.10]Hard to pry.
[212:20.78]Excuse me.
[212:21.44]And some sticks.
[212:22.30]Sought to prove.
[212:48.26]Oh, it's that guy again.
[212:56.01]Enemies ahead.
[212:56.55]Alright, I'm not reading them anymore.
[213:04.79]Ah, you're gonna come help me fight.
[213:06.47]I get you.
[213:07.59]No!
[213:18.14]I feel like there's consequences for each one of these.
[213:25.99]Tether?
[213:31.73]I can tether to him?
[213:33.69]I don't know what that means.
[213:41.19]Sure, why not.
[213:44.73]You coming?
[213:52.29]Oh, that's a lot of people.
[213:53.21]Are you coming or what?
[214:02.29]The grinder?
[214:06.06]What is it?
[214:07.12]Who are these people supposed to be?
[214:09.20]Why is that guy naked?
[214:11.19]Who are these people?
[214:16.09]Alright, don't die.
[214:30.94]Don't die.
[214:40.45]This music.
[214:49.45]Can we do it?
[214:55.46]Uh... What on earth is that?
[215:15.30]Let's go!
[215:19.53]Holy shit, that was so much easier than I thought it was going to be.
[215:23.43]That was so simple.
[215:26.21]Oh no, it's a joke.
[215:28.53]It's a joke?
[215:31.29]What?
[215:32.23]Alright, what do we do?
[215:37.40]Jesus!
[215:42.52]Jesus!
[215:59.00]What if my friend dies?
[216:05.36]No!
[216:05.72]He's gonna die!
[216:35.44]One hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit!
[216:39.16]Got it.
[216:44.12]And he stayed alive.
[216:47.78]The legendary?
[217:00.29]Thanks for the help.
[217:01.23]Actually, really thanks for the help because that probably would have been really hard.
[217:14.37]Huh?
[217:22.03]Why?
[217:22.31]Why would you even help?
[217:29.97]Grinders withered icon.
[217:31.97]Oh, that was supposed to be World of Warcraft players.
[217:39.56]That explains the naked guy, right?
[217:43.79]What is it?
[217:44.59]Increases heroic icon uses?
[217:50.54]The withered heroic icon of an obsessed hero, Amalgam.
[217:55.20]There was once something meaningful about this item, a legacy that can live on in you.
[218:01.18]Returning this to Nostalgaia through her beacons will increase the uses of your own heroic icon.
[218:12.21]Interesting.
[218:14.47]What was the weapon?
[218:18.73]The Lair Generic.
[218:23.49]Over one's distinct weapons are heroes grouping up beside the tavern's hearth.
[218:30.12]Strength.
[218:43.23]Very interesting.
[218:47.58]Okay.
[218:49.00]Well, that was cool.
[218:49.76]I'm going to go.
[218:50.82]Thanks for the help.
[218:51.86]These are probably a bunch of weird messages.
[218:53.46]Let's find out what this one says.
[218:54.94]I did it, and I can't believe it.
[218:56.20]I guess let's go.
[219:06.83]Your McDonald's order.
[219:08.03]Oh, um... McChicken.
[219:12.03]Get a large fry.
[219:12.77]Okay.
[219:15.27]This does not fit my narrative.
[219:20.74]Uh.
[219:23.34]Maybe a McDouble.
[219:26.16]I've since tamed my my McDonald's order.
[219:35.47]That helps.
[219:49.37]Remember ahead, but consider pixels.
[220:04.50]Um, what?
[220:13.34]Ahead?
[220:15.16]But I think I'm just dead if I walk here.
[220:32.69]Oh, okay.
[220:35.58]What is with that aim?
[220:36.70]That just was targeting me.
[221:13.27]I'm trying to survive here.
[221:30.05]Unburdened.
[221:30.67]Ooh.
[221:35.13]What's that?
[221:42.10]Unburdened.
[221:45.76]Oh, it's a quality weapon.
[221:47.60]Dex and strength.
[222:30.95]Uh-oh.
[222:40.94]Does he even know he's streaming?
[222:43.24]What?
[222:43.70]What happened?
[222:45.06]What?
[222:50.33]I'm fucking live.
[222:58.51]I like the sound effects you make when you run.
[223:02.96]My crafter.
[223:10.06]Strength.
[223:12.19]When she discarded all the implements of tradition, all the tools of craftsmanship that had defined progress here before, I was among the refuse.
[223:24.00]Minecraft pickaxe?
[223:26.40]Go to the bonfire?
[223:27.92]I'm alright for now.
[223:29.34]I'm alright.
[223:29.64]I'm doing good.
[223:32.39]I'm good.
[223:50.56]You are literally shaking.
[224:06.32]Watch out for left.
[224:08.35]Hey, look at that.
[224:11.27]Cheating.
[224:11.71]What?
[224:16.63]Like, what happened?
[224:17.65]Why did my game fucking froze?
[224:21.61]Oh.
[224:23.71]My game froze.
[224:40.58]Where do I go from here?
[224:44.10]I straight up don't know where I am.
[224:54.05]Oh, I know where I am.
[224:54.73]Okay.
[224:58.22]Bridge is down.
[224:58.80]Okay.
[225:12.01]Okay, actually I'm going to play here.
[225:18.51]Because I don't want to lose.
[225:30.27]I'm not going to pull the whole room.
[225:31.65]That would be so awful.
[225:32.45]Okay, let's do it again.
[226:14.27]Lucky flow state.
[226:33.84]Oh, shut up.
[226:35.78]There's no way.
[226:36.48]Whatever.
[226:46.36]You should do an oil tier list.
[226:49.92]Olive oil S. Peanut oil probably high A or low S.
[227:16.06]Crude oil?
[227:16.84]Uh, nah, crude oil's probably like, I would say like probably a D. You know what I mean?
[227:22.14]That's like a D.
[228:03.27]I got 13,000 right now.
[228:07.13]There's gotta be another bonfire coming up, I bet.
[228:13.37]Sunflower oil?
[228:14.15]That's a B. Shit.
[228:44.36]Seed oils.
[228:52.28]What about mineral oil?
[228:53.44]Ah, that might make a C. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[229:02.64]I almost died.
[229:14.80]all that to get all the way over here and pick this up but what about that the door um what's the right way to go what about lavender oil that's not bad
[229:53.31]Are they going to run all the way around?
[229:54.85]Actually, this is incredible for me.
[229:58.87]This is the best thing that could have happened.
[230:00.05]They're always going to leave.
[230:08.70]They're going the long way.
[230:26.34]They're all coming back.
[230:27.06]They're all coming back.
[230:27.74]They're all coming back.
[230:28.62]They're all coming back.
[230:29.68]They're all coming back.
[230:34.74]Is this a dead end?
[230:39.81]No.
[230:41.13]No, I go up.
[230:54.71]This is so stupid.
[231:08.77]Fuck it, let's go.
[231:15.51]Oh, not you again.
[231:16.83]Um, they're all gonna make it up here eventually.
[231:18.25]I gotta kill them one by one.
[231:23.64]What the fuck was that?
[231:24.76]I don't know what I just opened, but, um...
[231:36.10]I couldn't dodge.
[231:36.84]I just pressed it.
[231:38.16]I swear to God.
[231:39.34]I did just open something.
[231:48.74]I just opened something.
[231:49.59]Does anybody know where that is?
[231:56.99]That's a shortcut, but who knows where the hell that is?
[232:02.09]It's a door.
[232:02.89]It's some kind of door.
[232:09.93]Somebody said, dude, did you even try?
[232:12.32]I like that comment.
[232:16.92]Dude, did you even... Nah, I was... I just, like, felt like just dying there.
[232:21.30]Is this door which leads... No.
[232:29.01]Alright, slow down.
[232:47.08]Okay.
[232:47.84]Anybody know where I go from here?
[232:49.58]To get to there?
[233:12.23]Oh my goodness.
[233:22.19]behind you.
[233:23.21]So like through here.
[233:24.01]And then there's another door somewhere.
[233:28.09]I don't think this is right.
[233:49.62]Is it down there?
[233:50.64]I don't remember.
[233:52.95]I could go across and then to the right.
[233:56.09]But is that where the door is?
[233:57.83]Because this is the way that I was.
[234:00.44]Straight through here.
[234:01.34]But where's the door?
[234:02.34]Do you know?
[234:09.56]Hey, do you know?
[234:20.03]Down there.
[234:20.99]Over there.
[234:21.43]Um...
[234:23.65]I think I'll be alright.
[234:37.80]I'm gonna have like 20,000 souls.
[234:54.26]That shit took so long.
[235:01.35]You did this to yourself?
[235:03.13]I got two heals.
[235:03.85]I'm fine.
[235:07.79]Getting there.
[235:17.20]Slow as shit right now.
[235:20.25]I'm so slow!
[235:21.27]I'm so slow in the fucking- in whatever this- the poison swamp.
[235:38.87]Okay, we're good.
[235:40.75]This is where I left off, was down here.
[235:42.33]I remember this.
[235:54.88]Don't even give him a chance.
[235:59.14]Okay.
[236:01.28]Stop being so cocky.
[236:10.32]I just killed this guy right here.
[236:14.39]Don't let him cast that thing and I should be fine.
[236:16.15]Okay, never mind.
[237:03.01]That guy disappeared.
[237:03.75]That was really weird.
[237:06.15]Alright.
[237:19.20]I'm so close I can feel it.
[237:26.35]Up.
[237:28.63]Huh?
[237:32.35]Anything shakin'?
[237:49.32]I'm gonna be a level up like five times This bullshit I remember this room
[238:23.25]Don't let him do it.
[238:24.09]Did you do it?
[238:25.15]He did it.
[238:28.43]I got full health, though.
[238:29.29]Just don't be stupid.
[238:30.09]It's very simple.
[238:30.87]They have one attack pattern.
[238:32.27]Just wait.
[238:36.22]Like that.
[238:38.89]Everything's good?
[238:46.45]What the fuck?
[238:57.56]Who are you talking to?
[239:05.18]You!
[239:06.34]I'm talking to you directly.
[239:07.50]I'm talking to you.
[239:10.17]Right now, I'm speaking to you.
[239:32.27]Good.
[239:33.57]Alright, I'm almost there.
[239:34.61]I want to kill everything in this room.
[239:39.48]because you know that I'm going to aggro it somehow, some way stupidly.
[239:46.08]All right.
[239:46.71]Made it.
[239:47.85]Let's go.
[239:52.23]Now, where is it from here?
[239:53.17]I remember going in there and freaking out.
[239:54.43]You got to run all the way up.
[239:56.21]They throw the bombs.
[239:58.01]Yeah.
[240:12.35]Everything's fine.
[240:18.71]Everything's shut up.
[240:28.10]Do not kill me.
[240:29.16]They're right here.
[240:31.56]Where are my souls?
[240:33.62]Thank you.
[240:34.53]Okay, don't die.
[240:35.65]This person's freaking me out.
[240:46.39]Oh no.
[240:48.96]Um.
[240:50.34]Okay.
[240:51.08]Where?
[240:51.26]Is there a lever to pull?
[241:17.21]You did it!
[241:18.24]You really, really did it!
[241:20.22]You're opening up Nostalgaia's heart!
[241:23.26]All you have to do now is kill the other three Great Ones!
[241:28.79]I have two of these.
[241:56.03]If you can use it to make NostalGuy a super duper again, then I'm happy to part with it.
[242:02.01]Don't prick yourself.
[242:05.08]If you can... Oh, it hurts.
[242:10.76]Oh, yeah.
[242:11.86]Oh, I can take it.
[242:13.22]All right.
[242:14.60]No more of that.
[242:15.32]No more of that.
[242:15.84]I just didn't know.
[242:17.19]All right.
[242:17.65]What about here?
[242:34.64]What a freak.
[242:40.61]What?
[242:41.07]You're talking about me?
[242:44.67]21,000.
[242:44.69]Let's go.
[242:54.61]I can level up five times.
[242:56.01]25 luck.
[243:04.31]15 stamina.
[243:06.99]What a madman.
[243:08.86]What a madman!
[243:18.12]Enemies drop two times memory.
[243:22.21]That's gonna be amazing.
[243:43.87]Look at this thing.
[243:46.77]Unburdened?
[243:48.75]Unburdened.
[243:51.71]What's that mean?
[243:59.15]What do you think?
[244:03.27]Should I pivot to something else?
[244:05.75]This thing on the offhand is amazing.
[244:08.75]I definitely want to keep this in my offhand.
[244:20.60]110, 109.
[244:20.64]500.
[244:21.95]I don't know.
[244:30.33]Keep this, but replace the other thing.
[244:34.25]What do I really?
[244:34.97]I think this is probably the best thing I have.
[244:37.83]17.
[244:43.66]That's a lot of damage though.
[244:44.80]176.
[244:45.02]This has an upgrade.
[244:59.03]184.
[244:59.57]193.
[245:02.59]Yeah, this thing is amazing.
[245:06.86]I think I'm just going to upgrade this.
[245:15.26]Yeah, it's definitely this.
[245:16.00]Let's go.
[245:28.01]Okay.
[245:32.79]Now... Um... Anything else?
[245:37.55]What is this thing?
[245:38.75]Versus heroic icon uses.
[245:40.09]Heroic icon is this thing that I... Alright, so how do I use it?
[245:43.95]Use it at the bonfire?
[245:48.86]Return icon.
[245:50.60]Release a withered heroic icon back into the world.
[245:53.14]Wait.
[245:54.80]Wait.
[245:58.27]What does that mean?
[246:02.31]Are we speaking Spanish right now?
[246:03.39]Hey, when are you going to come to Maryland for some crabs?
[246:13.62]I hope this is not going to mess something up.
[246:18.18]Your own heroic icon becomes stronger, increasing its uses.
[246:22.88]Oh, yeah.
[246:23.20]Okay.
[246:23.63]Cool.
[246:24.05]Let's do it.
[246:29.98]Very nice.
[246:30.42]I don't think I have any more.
[246:35.40]Alright.
[246:37.29]I am ready.
[246:38.63]I got a new weapon upgrade.
[246:41.53]I go in here.
[246:49.89]Then we go up?
[246:55.99]Yep.
[246:56.73]Then we go out.
[246:59.01]And then we don't attack this.
[247:00.93]Then we go up.
[247:03.52]And we continue.
[247:06.58]I'm really enjoying this.
[247:07.56]I think this game is actually really fun.
[247:09.50]I'm very much enjoying this video game experience.
[247:11.96]Uh, do I...
[247:33.44]Well that- okay.
[247:50.92]New area.
[247:58.58]Barrel and crabs are fantastic.
[248:02.29]I bet you they are.
[248:04.09]I can't say I've ever had a crab from Maryland.
[248:09.68]New England had a lot of great seafood though.
[248:13.36]Northeast had plenty of that though.
[248:14.74]So I mean, I kind of already got that experience.
[248:24.13]This looks bad.
[248:31.81]You guys are strong as fuck.
[248:35.22]Oh my god.
[248:36.08]And I know I said that.
[248:36.92]I'm like 37.
[248:37.54]You know what I mean?
[248:40.04]But whatever.
[248:40.68]I gotta use some of the lingo you guys use.
[248:54.47]But did you have them with an old lady?
[248:57.37]Does that make it better?
[249:03.79]No, I did not eat any crabs with any old ladies.
[249:15.12]Now, is this old lady pressuring me to use a certain sauce that I don't want to use?
[249:22.72]Put some of that on there.
[249:24.82]Yeah, I've got to put on more than that.
[249:27.06]I'll try it.
[249:28.82]There's not enough on there.
[249:30.74]Let me see it.
[249:31.36]Let me do it.
[249:39.07]Eating this person.
[249:45.77]Can you stop jumping please?
[249:58.33]Oh, I like this zone.
[250:01.23]Castle.
[250:04.05]Why you been obsessed with sauce lately?
[250:09.05]Who made it?
[250:14.24]Who made the first sauce is really just when did civilization actually begin?
[250:18.34]It's pretty much what that is.
[250:21.31]That's kind of what it is.
[250:28.03]Uh, where does this take me?
[251:03.75]All right.
[251:10.23]All right.
[251:17.56]Oh, that's good to know.
[251:28.87]Can you do a live yoga stream?
[251:32.45]Dude, I'd pull a muscle.
[251:34.46]And I would have to get taken out in a stretcher.
[251:37.34]So, no.
[251:42.08]I would definitely be... Oh, here we go!
[251:43.74]It's time!
[251:44.08]We've got, like, a whole room full of people.
[251:45.75]And, like, there's, like, 30... There's, like, 20 people in the yoga class, whatever.
[251:49.29]Oh, and there's the yoga instructor.
[251:50.47]And...
[251:52.15]We're gonna do a bunch of made-up yoga moves that aren't real, and that's like funny, but at about 10 minutes into that stream, I'm gonna go, oh, now we're gonna do, um, you know, uh, the, the twisted turkey.
[252:05.49]And it's gonna be some dumb move, and I'm gonna do it, and I'm gonna, you're gonna see, I'm gonna go, ow, ow, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, and I'm gonna roll over on my back, and then we're gonna go to a BRB screen for 25 minutes.
[252:20.76]And then it's going to come back and there's going to be me being taken out in a stretcher.
[252:24.92]And somebody from the crew or somebody else that was there is going to be like, hey, sorry, everybody.
[252:28.08]But like he pulled a fucking, he like tore a muscle on his knee or something or his leg.
[252:32.80]And yeah, we're going to have to stop the stream.
[252:34.72]Like, see you next time.
[252:35.54]I don't know.
[252:35.84]He's probably going to go to the doctor or something.
[252:42.54]That's why I don't want to do that stream.
[252:53.80]You gonna spawn another train?
[252:54.74]Bro, where are you going?
[253:15.35]See?
[253:15.71]I saw it.
[253:16.19]There it is.
[253:18.49]Make it Bugleberry's Haunted Yoga.
[253:24.53]There's a bunch of demons, people dressed up in like weird, like fucking monster costumes.
[253:53.56]Mm-mm.
[253:53.78]Mm-mm.
[253:54.92]Uh-uh.
[253:56.94]I'm, like, in the middle of the yoga class.
[254:10.96]Just the door fucking bursts open.
[254:15.56]Or, like, bursts down.
[254:18.06]There's somebody like an adventurer being chased by like a giant dragon or something.
[254:22.38]Or two or three enemies and just fighting in the middle of yoga.
[254:25.00]And Bugleberry doesn't give a shit.
[254:28.13]Nobody pays attention to it at all.
[254:29.45]It's just shit is going down.
[254:30.67]I don't know where we are.
[254:37.95]Like these monsters like kill the adventurer and just start like eating them.
[254:43.44]We're not even paying attention.
[254:44.96]This just happens in this world.
[254:48.78]This person's gold.
[254:51.16]Yeah.
[254:55.56]That hurt a lot.
[255:04.01]Excuse me?
[255:18.26]Oh, sorry.
[255:19.76]That's a hard one.
[255:37.22]This.
[255:40.52]I don't know.
[255:42.98]My grandfather built this place 100 years ago.
[255:47.36]You probably need to add a zero.
[255:49.84]But I get what you're saying.
[255:56.87]Nice.
[256:03.97]Cracked wall?
[256:06.51]True.
[256:12.84]Who are these people?
[256:22.96]15 health, I think, is probably good.
[256:29.52]Yeah.
[256:36.79]Hey, dude, I couldn't help but notice that you haven't mentioned the fact that you spent $75 on Family Guy, the mobile game you have to stream.
[256:42.91]What gives?
[256:48.75]It's you!
[256:52.04]change makers often have good intentions but they can't control the pain their changes bring you know you it's a cycle I don't know about you but I just want to stop the suffering
[257:05.31]Well, I'm a giver like that.
[257:07.27]The local great one was not a giver.
[257:10.01]He devoured Nostalgaia's memories from within the player housing mansion up above.
[257:16.38]Desperate housing mansion.
[257:19.26]Terrible things, and even the best of us.
[257:22.40]I know you can beat him.
[257:26.47]I believe in you.
[257:27.73]Oh!
[257:29.85]Oh, hee hee hee!
[257:37.89]Oh, it hurts.
[257:46.77]Don't act like you wouldn't click.
[257:49.37]Don't act like you're not going to click to see what happens.
[257:57.38]Fuck.
[258:10.59]Oh, yeah.
[258:11.25]That's why you put all your points into luck right there.
[258:16.76]Alright, so where's the progress?
[258:19.20]Across the hall, maybe?
[258:21.00]Well, greater the aggro at everything.
[258:26.84]Fuck.
[258:27.28]Stop.
[258:27.86]You know what?
[258:28.79]Just restart the area.
[258:29.99]Just kill me.
[258:48.00]I gotta go up and to the left.
[258:57.24]Bad at video games, Andy.
[259:03.25]You're just looking for that one crit.
[259:15.74]That's all you need.
[259:25.86]Some whatever.
[259:28.92]2000 souls down here.
[259:30.18]Not a big deal.
[259:37.82]Like that.
[259:39.71]Like that.
[259:40.21]Do you like crepes?
[259:44.31]I do.
[259:44.55]I'm a fan.
[259:48.66]I don't remember the last time I ate a crepe.
[259:51.20]But they're very good.
[259:51.92]You know what?
[259:52.36]I like... Somebody might call me a weirdo for this, but I don't think they will.
[259:58.56]I like savory crepes more than sweet crepes.
[260:03.52]Please don't hurt me!
[260:04.26]Don't hurt me!
[260:06.46]You reared your fist back.
[260:07.66]You were gonna punch me.
[260:09.22]I just saw you do that.
[260:11.47]Relax.
[260:12.23]What's wrong with you?
[260:18.61]100% agree.
[260:26.72]Try confusion.
[260:35.79]Nice view.
[260:36.23]Nostalgia.
[260:43.15]I'm kind of curious.
[260:43.95]Does it... Alright, I need to know.
[260:46.75]Will it take...
[260:49.40]Half of a second to fall to the bottom.
[260:52.57]This is for research.
[260:56.67]Is it going to take one tenth of a second to fall all the way?
[261:01.05]One, two, three, four.
[261:04.41]It's very far.
[261:05.17]Okay, you've seen all the other times I've fallen off.
[261:06.86]It's like been a magnet.
[261:16.08]Fall joke for research.
[261:18.56]Yeah, I gotta just... Can I bypass this person?
[261:35.97]Kind of.
[261:36.29]Ball joke hypothesis.
[261:44.25]Yeah, you get it.
[261:58.29]Oh shit, it's you.
[261:59.51]Oh my friend, I am a failure.
[262:05.54]What happened?
[262:05.82]They do not want me.
[262:07.44]Look at me.
[262:08.78]They do not want any of us.
[262:10.92]Nearly heroes are we.
[262:13.32]The unproven, the unnamed.
[262:16.76]We follow in the footsteps of the greatest protagonists ever conceived.
[262:22.39]Why, I wondered, to fail?
[262:25.87]I now realize we are only here to confirm our lack of value.
[262:32.36]It wasn't I who vanquished the darkness in those mines.
[262:36.46]We both know it.
[262:37.92]On the balconies above, I faced a foe I could not best.
[262:42.06]She was fast and filled with conviction.
[262:46.25]Though I did not recognize her story, she threw me down with the skill of someone whose story should be well known.
[262:53.15]I can handle it.
[262:53.83]Let us go and I were separated when I charged into the confrontation.
[262:57.89]Be wary if you go forth.
[263:00.70]I will stay here to be forgotten.
[263:03.62]The nothing that I am.
[263:06.62]Bro, do you have any idea how much money I've put into this game?
[263:09.50]This sword alone is worth probably $1,500 to $1,600.
[263:11.74]I'm going to be just fine.
[263:12.62]Whoa, wait a minute.
[263:13.10]I have a shield of inspiration.
[263:14.89]Should I give it to him?
[263:36.69]Yeah, sure.
[263:38.21]Okay, so... I need to remember the shield.
[263:41.95]Heartflow Altar.
[264:07.76]So that's in the first area.
[264:09.94]So I have to get the memory from the shield, bring it back here, give it to this guy.
[264:16.07]I wonder what that is.
[264:20.33]Should I go look for it?
[264:22.71]That's way back.
[264:27.75]Too much work?
[264:29.92]Well, I feel like this is part two of this quest, and I kind of feel like I want to do Transportation.
[264:34.60]Yeah, why not?
[264:35.12]I want to do it.
[264:37.27]I have no idea where I'm going.
[264:38.69]Can somebody just tell me, uh, can somebody give me exact directions?
[264:42.50]And I'm talking, like, walk forward five seconds, turn left, walk forward five seconds, turn right, walk forward ten seconds to get me all the way back.
[264:53.20]That'd be, like, really helpful.
[264:57.35]I'm gonna try it.
[264:57.83]Seeberger see if I can know where the hell I'm going.
[264:59.81]I need to tether, though.
[265:00.73]Take a right at the Taco Bell.
[265:08.51]Let me tether here.
[265:17.51]It's back where you first met that old man.
[265:19.19]Okay, so I'm here in the theater.
[265:28.83]All right.
[265:29.19]Time to backtrack.
[265:36.18]There is that elevator, right?
[265:39.74]Which brings me all... Yeah, let's go back.
[265:41.68]I want to see what happens.
[265:42.84]Might get a cool item or something.
[266:02.79]Oh, there's an item over here.
[266:08.72]I can't get it.
[266:15.93]Can you fast travel?
[266:20.03]I don't know.
[266:21.36]That's a good question.
[266:22.04]Maybe I can.
[266:29.12]That's a great question.
[266:29.94]OK, we're not quite there.
[266:34.54]I need to go back even further.
[266:38.24]You can only TP to your tether.
[266:39.88]All right, so I remember going, oh shit, it's a boss.
[266:46.92]It's through here.
[266:47.52]Let's get out of this way through here.
[267:07.41]Okay.
[267:08.87]I remember this.
[267:10.29]Now we go back here.
[267:14.58]Uh-huh.
[267:16.38]This is where the old man was sitting.
[267:17.52]Is it here?
[267:24.34]No.
[267:26.15]We're all the way back here.
[267:35.99]That's not the tutorial zone, is it?
[267:48.81]Where did I first meet that guy?
[268:00.15]It's right after the tutorial.
[268:03.41]So right here.
[268:08.83]This game feels like a like Just Dance 2016.
[268:10.81]What?
[268:20.36]Alright.
[268:22.69]Here we are.
[268:25.67]And... Shit.
[268:29.42]We're in this zone.
[268:43.78]Come on, what does it say?
[268:45.14]My siblings and I encouraged pledging heroes through their doubts and toward their purpose.
[268:50.46]Purpose ultimately found rest in Nistalgaia's heart, somewhere beneath her central shrine.
[268:55.63]So under, below.
[269:01.61]How do I get under here?
[269:04.45]Oh, wait a minute.
[269:10.50]How do I get down there?
[269:14.98]Oh.
[269:18.83]Okay.
[269:24.30]Right here.
[269:27.40]Yep.
[269:30.11]Remember.
[269:42.44]Very cool.
[269:43.26]Alright, so now I can... How do I teleport back?
[269:52.01]Do I have an item?
[269:53.47]This one?
[269:57.50]This is multiplayer.
[270:00.48]Oh, okay, cool.
[270:11.35]Reminds me of Midi Evil for the original PlayStation.
[270:14.29]I can see that.
[270:14.79]Alright.
[270:20.31]What did that give us?
[270:33.04]You can't be serious.
[270:49.67]Stop!
[270:50.61]Oh my goodness.
[270:51.35]I just want to complete the quest.
[270:54.74]Well, I know where I'm going.
[271:34.32]No more stamina!
[271:41.74]Die already!
[271:54.68]I'm just getting absolutely just dominated by these people.
[272:08.64]Okay.
[272:09.88]All right, let's go.
[272:15.52]Hey dude, I'm trying to do surgery on somebody.
[272:24.39]Can you please keep it down?
[272:32.05]I'm just in the operating room.
[272:34.39]All right, here we go.
[272:35.85]You wish to uplift me.
[272:38.15]It's few.
[272:39.39]Here.
[272:40.17]What is that for me?
[272:44.21]This is thank you.
[272:46.97]Thank you, fellow hero.
[272:49.94]We are heroes.
[272:51.64]We.
[272:52.55]We together.
[272:53.79]Our company defines us, yes.
[272:59.15]I am the great, self-named, nameless Nero.
[273:04.90]As with my title, so too am I the determiner of my actions.
[273:10.70]Thank you, friend.
[273:12.04]I shall don this with pride.
[273:15.00]For was it not I who vanquished the darkness deep within the mines?
[273:19.81]It's true.
[273:25.37]You did do that.
[273:26.83]Soon I shall resume my quest.
[273:30.17]I will be immortalized in the pantheon of heroes.
[273:34.57]You'll be there too, I think.
[273:36.47]Hope so.
[273:37.85]All right.
[273:39.05]We make progress.
[273:39.75]See you in the next random spot you're going to be standing.
[273:53.02]The irredeemable sliver persisted onward, witnessing what Nostalgaia might once have been and what it had become.
[274:02.67]I hear wings.
[274:07.91]You are a weirdo.
[274:21.08]Hey, I'm currently watching this on a roller coaster.
[274:26.31]Can you please keep it up?
[274:28.09]Like, turn it up.
[274:34.65]Memory of an NPC zone boss.
[274:36.31]That's funny.
[274:40.15]Watching, like, YouTube shorts on a rollercoaster is, I think, peak 2023, don't you think?
[274:45.23]I mean, this is not a YouTube short, but, you know, you get it.
[274:54.48]Watching a Twitch stream is like, no.
[274:56.24]What do you think?
[274:57.86]It's a gamer joke.
[275:00.42]Why'd you say YouTube shorts?
[275:01.50]Because you guys watch YouTube shorts, don't you?
[275:11.37]No.
[275:15.51]Is YouTube shorts the not cool one?
[275:18.41]You guys watch TikTok?
[275:18.91]TikTok?
[275:25.51]Yes, yes.
[275:29.25]Fuck.
[275:30.17]Trying to be relatable to the younger generation and I screwed it up.
[275:38.63]Shit.
[275:42.58]Get off me.
[275:51.22]Blood of a blood of a blood of a blood.
[275:52.64]What is that?
[275:57.67]Flies recursion.
[276:07.24]Well.
[276:16.26]Nice try.
[276:16.90]Brain piercer.
[276:19.23]Let's try it again.
[276:25.25]Wait, I hear something flying.
[276:34.84]Why does everybody bite you?
[276:47.04]How do I get over there?
[276:58.54]From that door?
[277:06.95]I think we're almost at the boss.
[277:12.82]Something terrible ahead.
[277:16.62]Oh, it's a toilet.
[277:25.02]Hey, Spinal, you know, my buddy stopped watching the stream.
[277:27.53]L plus U fell off.
[277:34.40]I just imagine you sitting in a Discord call with a friend.
[277:42.11]You're both watching the stream and this friend is just like, um, yeah, I don't know.
[277:47.71]I'm not a big fan of Jeremiah anymore.
[277:50.23]Nah, I think I'm out of here.
[277:52.80]Maybe if you want to play, like, fucking, like, Alivepex, whatever the fucking game is.
[277:59.86]Um.
[278:01.94]Just let me know tomorrow or whatever.
[278:03.38]You know what?
[278:05.14]It's hard to talk and play at the same time a game like this.
[278:10.73]So never mind.
[278:12.89]But why would you be... Never mind.
[278:14.89]Alephag... Alephax?
[278:20.69]I don't even know what I said.
[278:21.79]There's a gun!
[278:31.83]It's just trash.
[278:44.62]Stupid.
[278:59.56]Your job is to talk and play games.
[279:09.24]You know how hard it is to talk and do anything?
[279:18.17]Hey, you know what?
[279:19.37]My job is whatever I want it to be.
[279:21.13]How does that sound?
[279:21.83]Sometimes I do a comb stream where I just comb my hair.
[279:24.36]Is that a video game?
[279:25.92]No.
[279:29.34]Sometimes I'm on camera doing something.
[279:31.42]Is that playing a game?
[279:32.32]No.
[279:32.50]No.
[279:47.42]He's rebelling.
[279:49.21]Yes.
[279:49.71]Yeah, I am.
[279:50.43]Yeah, let's go.
[279:51.53]I'm rebelling.
[279:57.96]I'm afraid of this room.
[280:03.62]I can't imagine you on camera.
[280:05.14]It's gross.
[280:05.70]You don't want to see it.
[280:20.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[280:23.27]The ground is moving.
[280:38.10]This is a lot nicer toilet.
[280:39.14]Okay.
[280:54.16]Wow, look at failure.
[280:55.72]Oh, it's Sonic the Hedgehog.
[281:01.38]Cute.
[281:02.06]Funny.
[281:03.32]That's a cute little reference.
[281:10.66]I'm... Okay, somebody was in the doorway, but I don't want to go that way because I think that's the boss.
[281:15.38]And I want to try to see if there's anything over here I can find.
[281:17.18]Like a bonfire that I can level up with.
[281:24.86]And I'm thinking that it's probably down here.
[281:33.74]Scope cutter.
[281:34.38]Wait.
[281:34.56]Oh, it's the Assassin's Creed Unity Prison.
[281:38.18]You have a different weapon.
[281:41.03]What?
[281:41.33]Oh no.
[282:07.03]I need to wear better clothes.
[282:08.31]I look like a fucking dickhead.
[282:34.84]Sometimes I feel to try and understand it all like like a finger staring at its hand or its arm or its whole body a Thing trying to glean its purpose from the thing it is a part of though my body lacks much sense at all so perhaps I've spun a feudal metaphor
[282:56.01]Voice work is really good in this game.
[282:57.69]Actually, pretty surprising that it is considering it's, you know, sometimes that's the last thing that an indie developer thinks about is stuff like that.
[283:06.08]But it's very, very, very good.
[283:13.02]Everything's very well done.
[283:14.39]Feels very good to play.
[283:19.97]I can imagine a lot of times if you're an indie game developer, and you make this game, and it's like, oh shit, I have to hire a bunch of voice acting.
[283:29.80]Or, you know, however it works, I guess.
[283:32.56]It's like an expense.
[283:38.44]Okay, Roger Ebert, play the game.
[283:41.14]What the fuck?
[283:42.94]I am!
[283:43.94]What are you talking about?
[283:47.80]I'm so, that tells me so much.
[283:52.88]Oh, hey, isn't it your, isn't it your job to play games?
[283:55.92]Let's talk about like something in the industry.
[283:58.08]Hey, no, don't do that.
[283:59.82]Don't do, I want to hear you say anything about that.
[284:12.26]All right, now I'm going to die because I'm not paying attention.
[284:17.39]I'm dead.
[284:18.13]I'm dead.
[284:18.63]And I blame that person for that.
[284:19.67]Let's have like a conversation about like, you know, the industry.
[284:25.07]In the mod chat right now, I'm surprised your chat knows who Roger Ebert even is.
[284:38.49]Yeah.
[284:53.72]Alright, I gotta get over there before I lose all those s-s-s-s-souls.
[285:15.47]Sometimes this stream feels like how long can 10,000 people bully a 40 year old man until he turns the stream off.
[285:20.80]I do not agree.
[285:23.25]I don't agree.
[285:28.18]What you said was funny, but I disagree.
[285:41.72]You've got to be kidding me and I had an opportunity right there!
[285:52.01]There we go.
[285:52.79]You see that flourish?
[285:57.59]Yeah, you see that snap right there at the end?
[286:00.65]Did you see that snap finish?
[286:07.76]That was actually bullshit.
[286:10.42]That was like a double animation.
[286:15.14]Cherries.
[286:22.63]Where did I even die?
[286:23.53]I hate Jerma.
[286:34.81]I hope he reads my comment and gets sad.
[286:37.44]Ban that person.
[286:38.82]You know what?
[286:39.76]How does this sound?
[286:40.56]Ban that person for an hour.
[286:41.70]See ya.
[286:47.26]For one full hour.
[286:53.34]One full hour.
[287:03.49]And then let them repent.
[287:07.27]And then reduce it to five minutes.
[287:19.27]Will you please land?
[287:20.07]Because you just land and mess everything up.
[287:26.18]Oh my god, that move is so annoying!
[287:28.40]I'm just running.
[287:53.30]No, I need my shit.
[287:54.62]Hold on.
[287:57.30]What is this?
[287:59.32]Did you tell me this was right here the whole time?
[288:02.14]God damn it.
[288:16.19]Is this one of those Superman all arcade games?
[288:22.19]What does that mean?
[288:33.41]I had the exact same question.
[288:34.67]Am I missing something?
[288:36.93]Do I like butterscotch?
[288:37.63]I do.
[288:39.24]Butterscotch is good.
[288:41.34]Only in very, very small doses, though.
[288:44.88]You can really overdo butterscotch and it'll ruin everything.
[288:50.51]Alright, let me... What's going on here?
[288:56.37]It's like pesto?
[288:57.11]Yeah, that's true.
[289:03.66]Butterscotch on ice cream.
[289:06.08]Just straight up vanilla bean ice cream with butterscotch.
[289:09.39]Hot.
[289:11.43]And you let that rest.
[289:15.21]And then you eat it after it kind of solidifies a little.
[289:21.09]You know what I'm talking about?
[289:22.15]When it gets to that point where it sort of becomes one with the ice cream drizzled.
[289:31.04]Let me out.
[289:31.44]I want to get that item.
[289:32.44]Whatever.
[289:32.68]Whatever.
[289:40.82]And then, don't even get me talking about this, at the very end, you have this weird mixture at the bottom of the cup.
[289:51.73]It's this weird, fucked up liquid, isn't it?
[289:54.45]Is that Super Mario Castle?
[290:02.49]It's this weird, weird liquid that's kind of... If you know, you know.
[290:14.77]It's kind of runny ice cream, but weirdly solidified, almost butterscotch bits.
[290:24.01]And it's probably the best part.
[290:28.27]Now, where did I die?
[290:36.43]Where did I die?
[290:37.17]Right there.
[290:44.47]That's so sloppy.
[290:58.74]Okay, I just looked over a chat and somebody said, take those boxes off now.
[291:02.99]And I was going to ban you.
[291:03.91]I was going to have you get banned because I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[291:05.95]And I'm like, wait, right.
[291:13.64]I was about to be like, yeah, this person's being a weirdo.
[291:17.76]Like, what the fuck are they talking about?
[291:18.84]And they go, right, okay.
[291:20.48]But you are right, okay.
[291:26.69]What's my total weight?
[291:27.45]That's actually not bad.
[291:41.24]Coward.
[291:47.77]Coward.
[291:51.35]Coward!
[292:00.10]Dead in one hit.
[292:07.32]Jesus.
[292:07.82]Okay, almost there.
[292:21.93]Shut up.
[292:22.61]There's no way.
[292:28.19]Spear enemies are the worst in any video game, doesn't matter what it is.
[292:31.45]Across all platforms, across all genres, across all console generations.
[292:36.21]Across every game, across every arcade cabinet, across every dice game, doesn't matter what it is.
[292:41.99]Across every tabletop game, doesn't matter what it is.
[292:45.32]Spear enemies are the worst enemies in all media.
[293:05.39]Because spears are superior to swords.
[293:09.87]Yeah, we all saw that history channel video or show.
[293:15.76]Like, who would win?
[293:16.64]A samurai or a medieval warrior.
[293:22.40]We've all seen it.
[293:23.53]And we all know that spear is the best weapon.
[293:40.37]We all saw that the samurai lost to the caveman.
[293:46.02]Caveman had club and raw chicken.
[293:48.40]And that's, I mean, we all saw it.
[293:51.08]And then it was the tier list they made and the caveman came out on top every time.
[293:56.04]It was weird because they even went as far as to, what was it?
[293:58.63]They did like modern stuff too.
[294:01.53]And the caveman beat modern military person with weapons like guns and stuff, which is, I don't know how strange.
[294:12.14]I think it's just the force that a caveman could swing a club.
[294:15.44]It was like 600,000 pounds per square inch or something.
[294:18.32]It was something crazy.
[294:19.32]More than like a dinosaur jaw.
[294:32.55]That didn't happen.
[294:33.25]You're an idiot.
[294:34.19]Well, what did I watch then?
[294:35.25]What did I watch then, huh?
[294:36.57]What did I watch?
[294:37.29]I'm being weird tonight.
[294:38.79]I'm sorry.
[294:39.17]I'm sorry.
[294:48.05]You gotta put these... Dude, I hate being up on these rafters.
[294:50.85]Okay.
[295:00.98]Come on.
[295:04.48]What?
[295:23.29]worth it not really do I have any heals cherry oh brain piercer I can oh wait I got multiple memories here quacks strut pixelating cane concealing a telescoping blade this is a dex weapon
[296:11.57]I mean, this is a sorceress, a sorcery weapon, whatever.
[296:16.33]But.
[296:19.55]It's cool.
[296:19.93]Is that it?
[296:26.29]Is there any more?
[296:30.93]I'm really interested in this one.
[296:34.35]Where is it?
[296:35.67]Quack Strut.
[296:39.71]Fuck.
[296:41.31]I really hope I was... I think I... I think I'm alright.
[296:50.48]This thing is awesome.
[296:51.50]I want this.
[296:56.98]Alright, so this is... Yep.
[296:57.62]Here's the plan.
[296:59.94]This is like a poke.
[297:01.78]This is a slash.
[297:05.54]I think this is the right call.
[297:07.01]This is a spear.
[297:17.10]It's a sharp weapon.
[297:27.07]Wristless tooth.
[297:36.07]I hate those things.
[297:43.00]There's more to do in here.
[297:43.78]Oh, fuck.
[298:05.09]I need, when you're talking about me having no health.
[298:10.10]That's when you're talking, you know, when you're talking about having no health, right?
[298:13.58]That's what I'm talking about.
[298:14.44]When you're talking about... The damage sucks ass, but...
[298:35.48]Doesn't matter what's in my main hand anyways.
[298:36.96]All my upgrades in my off hand.
[298:51.57]Shit.
[298:53.83]You know what?
[298:54.51]Just play it safe.
[299:14.84]Alright.
[299:15.76]There is an item over here and... Is that an NPC?
[299:22.49]No.
[299:23.71]Holy shit!
[299:25.09]Everything's fine.
[299:25.89]I think I died.
[299:58.61]No, I don't wanna.
[300:00.99]I don't wanna.
[300:01.69]I don't want to fight.
[300:03.27]I don't want to fight you.
[300:04.49]I don't want to.
[300:05.07]Don't fucking come at me.
[300:10.88]It's the only thing I could think of.
[300:21.83]Okay, thank God.
[300:29.39]So what is the item?
[300:30.73]There's another person too.
[300:31.73]Holy shit, that went right by my face.
[300:37.13]Thought I got grabbed.
[300:54.52]No, I tried so hard.
[300:56.96]It was so stressful.
[300:58.16]Because I knew I was backing up into the wall.
[301:00.56]And I didn't know where the staircase was behind me.
[301:02.32]So I'm like, shit.
[301:03.92]I don't know how far back I can go.
[301:05.52]Oh, I don't know how far I am.
[301:10.70]I'm just going to run.
[301:13.42]Actually, no, no, no.
[301:15.82]I got the shortcut here.
[301:17.70]Not as bad as it could be.
[301:28.89]That show is called Deadliest Warrior.
[301:30.87]Yeah.
[301:33.87]Why can't I... Deadliest War... Deadliest Warrior.
[301:37.39]Why am I saying, like, Deadliest Warrior?
[301:39.03]It's not that far.
[302:00.47]This thing's cool.
[302:02.89]Should I upgrade the cane?
[302:04.31]This is the wrong way, isn't it?
[302:11.43]It is.
[302:16.70]This guy stinks.
[302:22.08]Oh, by the way, tomorrow, if you did not know, I mentioned it in the beginning of the stream, but let's bring it up again.
[302:29.36]Tomorrow is a sponsored stream.
[302:30.88]I'm going to be playing Wild Hearts.
[302:35.29]That Monster Hunter kind of game.
[302:40.67]Seems pretty fun.
[302:42.81]And I believe I'll be playing it with Vinny.
[302:50.61]So that should be fun.
[302:58.49]This actually was a pretty good question.
[302:59.59]I want to, I want to answer it.
[303:01.97]I kind of, I can't alt tab.
[303:04.39]Um, somebody asked, that's not a bad question.
[303:07.84]What do you do genuinely if a game sucks?
[303:13.90]That's a good question.
[303:14.72]I'm going to answer it as best as I can in about five minutes when this room is clear.
[303:23.40]Spear is such a bad weapon.
[303:26.43]Honestly.
[303:26.77]Give me a club.
[303:28.71]Shit was way better.
[303:29.63]Way stronger.
[303:31.05]Just huge surface area to just hit somebody in the fucking face with.
[303:34.26]So much better than a spear.
[303:36.28]Give me a huge club.
[303:37.16]Okay.
[303:53.75]Almost there.
[304:01.74]Now you land.
[304:02.35]Alright, go ahead and do it, please.
[304:08.65]You're just not gonna do it.
[304:10.35]You're just gonna die.
[304:11.05]Um, what do you do if a game sucks?
[304:20.80]There's a couple of options there.
[304:21.90]So...
[304:25.28]If a game, when you say sucks, you mean the game is genuinely bad.
[304:28.52]Like, I cannot stomach even playing it anymore.
[304:31.72]Then I won't.
[304:33.46]I'll stop.
[304:33.82]I'll move on to something else.
[304:35.76]If a game sucks just barely enough, I will typically stay with it.
[304:40.88]Because you never know when a kind of a dumpy game might actually get really fun.
[304:49.60]There's definitely been opportunities where I thought the game wasn't that fun.
[304:52.76]Then an hour goes by and I'm having a great time.
[304:57.17]Very, very good example of this was Dark and Darker.
[305:01.29]The first hour or two of Dark and Darker, I was like, this game is fucking ass.
[305:05.04]Why do people play this?
[305:06.86]And I may have stopped, but I kind of played it for a little longer and it was like, no, no, no, wait a minute.
[305:11.68]This is actually really fun.
[305:12.58]I really, really like this.
[305:13.70]This is awesome.
[305:16.39]You got to be careful.
[305:19.37]You don't know if the game actually sucks or not, or if you're just not giving it the time and the kind of brainpower that it deserves.
[305:29.75]You never know.
[305:33.84]And also, everybody has such different opinions on stuff that a game that I say sucks, well, this game's ass.
[305:40.28]What a terrible fucking game.
[305:41.58]This might be your favorite game of all time.
[305:53.23]Right?
[305:53.77]Like, it could be a thing that you really, really enjoy.
[306:00.83]So many different opinions.
[306:09.69]What time tomorrow?
[306:10.67]Oh, same time.
[306:11.05]Probably around 6.
[306:13.79]This is the way to get in here.
[306:15.25]Uh-huh.
[306:19.11]Where... I don't know.
[306:19.65]Where did I die?
[306:20.31]Down?
[306:24.54]Down?
[306:32.51]No, I came through this way.
[306:35.71]No, I never got the item.
[306:37.66]That's right.
[306:38.04]I died in here.
[306:38.64]This is going to be really stupid and really bad idea, but I don't care.
[307:13.75]Where's my shit?
[307:21.27]Goodbye.
[307:30.71]Goodbye.
[307:32.61]Was there anything else in here?
[307:37.73]Shit.
[307:38.81]I have to go that way.
[308:05.12]See ya.
[308:12.58]Get down to the bottom.
[308:20.95]Almost there.
[308:21.45]Ooh.
[308:26.69]Alright, important.
[308:30.65]Wait, anything vibrating?
[308:31.51]Vibrating?
[308:42.07]Oh come on, this staircase just fucking ruined everything.
[309:09.82]Dude, and everybody ran all the- Oh, no, that's bad.
[309:14.62]That's very bad.
[309:16.63]That's so bad.
[309:18.39]I'm so fucked here.
[309:23.39]Wizard, help!
[309:25.51]Wizard, please!
[309:26.23]They're all just single file.
[309:27.77]Dude, help!
[309:28.66]Oh my goodness.
[309:30.12]Okay, I need to-
[309:45.50]This dude is so much faster than me because he drank my fucking fluids or whatever it was.
[309:49.82]There's no way.
[310:07.80]Nope.
[310:17.06]I have to be a total coward here.
[310:41.79]I'm sorry.
[310:42.43]It's scary.
[310:43.19]It's intense.
[310:48.46]I'm sorry.
[310:49.02]Jeez.
[311:04.37]Okay.
[311:04.69]Everything's fine.
[311:08.95]That was gnarly.
[311:09.74]I just don't want to run all the way back here.
[311:23.23]Hey, we're not doing Bugleberry's yoga class yet.
[311:42.42]Alright.
[311:43.90]Very, very cool.
[311:46.54]Whoa.
[311:46.84]I didn't even see that.
[311:55.36]Nope.
[311:59.26]Way too much to lose.
[312:19.30]Do your thing.
[312:24.34]All right.
[312:25.95]Now let me actually pay attention to what... Uh... I feel like there might be stuff glowing in here.
[312:39.40]Tooth?
[312:43.16]Nothing?
[312:46.94]No.
[312:48.46]Stay in a region on parry.
[312:57.21]Alright, please tell me everything you just said again.
[312:59.67]You've put on quite the show, hero.
[313:02.37]Has your toiling and bleeding brought you answers?
[313:06.45]Or has the struggle to discover been taken from you?
[313:10.13]Have you been gifted direction?
[313:15.12]That's how I open the pixel doors.
[313:30.61]I wonder, you have no doubt seen the flickering doors throughout Nostalgia.
[313:36.15]They are chasms with no path forward because they hold no memory of what they were.
[313:42.70]What might happen if you offered memory back to these these forgetting spaces?
[313:49.36]Why don't you try?
[313:50.44]It can be restored, offering some of your collected memory.
[313:56.08]Place your stick arm on this flickering door.
[314:00.92]Okay.
[314:03.48]You gotta pay.
[314:06.66]That's it?
[314:08.16]50 memory.
[314:08.52]That's nothing.
[314:10.33]That's two quarters.
[314:11.91]Oh.
[314:19.88]I expected as much.
[314:21.82]Tis not only objects that are forgetting themselves in Nostalgia.
[314:26.12]Her hostile denizens may also be affected by your generosity.
[314:37.29]Your weaponless stick arms do more damage?
[314:40.03]They also have other effects.
[314:41.45]For example, try punching an enemy's shield.
[314:44.39]Wait, what do you mean?
[314:49.89]Unarmed playthrough.
[314:57.73]Oh.
[315:08.59]That's for another playthrough.
[315:13.86]That's cool.
[315:14.55]The past and future are inseparable.
[315:18.32]The future cannot be interpreted without the context of the past.
[315:22.92]And if the past is meaningful, it is only so because of the future it enables.
[315:29.66]Your own meaning, hero.
[315:33.14]It's becoming clearer to me.
[315:36.07]Restore our memory.
[315:38.07]A personal, as much as pragmatic, request.
[315:42.65]Restore...
[315:44.83]I will try.
[315:48.13]You gave back.
[315:50.13]The useless, ugly abomination gave back.
[315:54.02]One of those pothead people.
[316:06.04]Fatima Hassan!
[316:07.54]Fatima Hassan!
[316:17.92]I'm dead instantly.
[316:18.64]I died in one hit.
[316:19.48]This is so far.
[316:38.42]And it was 18,000.
[316:38.74]Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.
[316:51.94]Wait, I did get a shortcut.
[316:52.84]I forget where it is.
[316:53.65]I unlocked it?
[316:58.33]Ah, it's too late.
[316:59.57]I don't know where it is.
[317:06.02]I don't remember.
[317:06.40]It was right next to the bonfire.
[317:13.19]Ah, whatever.
[317:20.41]We want you to be scared more.
[317:25.41]You don't get to demand anything from me.
[317:28.37]No more demands.
[317:29.87]How does that sound?
[317:30.49]He's gonna run.
[318:04.14]I just aggroed everything here for no reason.
[318:09.55]Wait.
[318:16.29]There it is.
[318:30.19]I'm coming!
[318:35.86]Be there shortly.
[318:36.82]Hitbox on that.
[318:48.64]It's just broken.
[319:12.34]Alright.
[319:14.10]Where am I going?
[319:14.66]There's three ways for me to go.
[319:16.86]There's this way, which is where the pothead is.
[319:21.02]And then it's up through there.
[319:29.66]Yep.
[319:32.06]Okay.
[319:32.86]Should I fight the pothead?
[319:35.54]Don't even start with this bullshit.
[319:38.74]Oh, you're so annoying.
[319:45.29]Back off.
[319:51.37]Shortcut is through that door.
[319:52.65]Alright.
[319:54.15]Alright, round two.
[319:55.25]Let's win by cheating.
[319:56.95]Fucking hurt.
[320:26.97]Oh my god, you kill!
[320:28.51]Can I just crit your weapon?
[320:34.51]That was stupid.
[320:46.10]Anti-hero establishment.
[320:50.14]What?
[320:52.86]What?
[320:57.78]Okay.
[321:10.36]Anything glowing?
[321:13.68]No.
[321:22.26]Parable of balance.
[321:23.88]New area that way.
[321:26.44]Gems and jewels
[321:33.99]Chasm ahead.
[321:37.15]Wow, look at hilarious thing.
[321:41.90]I want to see the funny thing.
[321:42.64]Where is it?
[321:54.41]What is it?
[322:04.50]Quest reward vault.
[322:07.16]Five of these can be remembered.
[322:09.77]Nothing in this room.
[322:34.46]Weird.
[322:41.48]Why do I... It sounds like glintstone.
[322:44.52]Sure it is.
[322:44.90]Some version of it.
[322:46.33]Oh, wait.
[322:59.15]How much... A thousand bucks to open this.
[323:01.47]Better be worth it.
[323:06.57]Unburdened, another one.
[323:14.51]Okay, strength and dex.
[323:15.97]Alright, is there a bonfire down here?
[323:25.00]Not.
[323:27.14]Does the game have powers dancing?
[323:28.52]It actually might.
[323:38.00]Alright, fuck that.
[323:38.76]I'm just going into the vault.
[323:41.86]They can fight each other for all I care.
[323:43.66]Oh, not you again.
[323:44.44]Alright.
[323:59.73]What is it?
[324:00.62]Oh, a lot of anguish out there, isn't there, good buddy?
[324:04.14]Oh, geez.
[324:05.30]Yeah, there is.
[324:06.44]Oh, remember that sweet sword I gave you?
[324:09.72]Powerful, right?
[324:11.44]I can give you more powerful artifacts.
[324:14.55]All you have to do is bring me the relics you find that are burdened with memories.
[324:20.70]I can absorb their suffering, their longing, so you don't need to solve their mysteries.
[324:28.27]Instead, you'll get to wield super-duper awesome versions of them to beat up whatever bad guys you chase.
[324:36.29]And their liberated husks won't have any memories left to burden you with.
[324:42.08]Win-win!
[324:47.10]Wait, what?
[324:48.36]Unburdened.
[324:50.24]Unburdened relics are stronger but lose their lore and special ability.
[324:54.64]This cannot be undone.
[325:09.63]Oh, you turn it in.
[325:10.97]You probably can go the other way.
[325:14.18]I'm imagining there's somebody in the game that can... Because I have three weapons that are unburdened already.
[325:19.86]Just for pure damage, yeah.
[325:22.24]I mean, that's kind of... Maybe I should just do it to this.
[325:26.12]Do I really care what this does?
[325:29.46]Don't do it.
[325:30.02]Lower is important.
[325:31.64]It can't be... Cannot be undone.
[325:33.66]So, oh.
[325:34.44]5,000 bucks.
[325:44.26]Sure.
[325:48.89]What a waste of money.
[325:59.72]But does this get consumed?
[326:02.06]Can I just put it on?
[326:07.78]Or is it like a talisman?
[326:09.04]I'm afraid to use it.
[326:16.15]Oh, how did I not even look down here?
[326:18.43]Oops.
[326:25.55]I haven't even looked down here.
[326:30.13]Health regen.
[326:31.93]Probably dexterity.
[326:36.27]How much is that?
[326:36.73]20 dex.
[326:39.99]That's a lot.
[326:40.73]How much is that giving me?
[326:47.69]Oh my goodness, that's a lot.
[326:51.19]Okay.
[326:52.69]Nice.
[326:54.55]Don't you play games for a living?
[326:58.87]No, I don't.
[326:59.49]Okay.
[327:07.83]What else is out here?
[327:11.95]Yep.
[327:18.34]Crown of the Undone.
[327:26.26]New hat.
[327:29.14]A pixelating warlock's crown.
[327:32.75]The murders of my NPC were tallied where his corpses were dumped.
[327:41.25]In the World of Warcraft cave?
[327:49.41]8.1 and 11.
[327:52.45]What does degradation mean?
[327:59.41]I think this thing's just better.
[328:00.21]Okay.
[328:11.73]Very interesting.
[328:13.35]I'm going to keep moving.
[328:14.35]I hope there's a bonfire.
[328:20.94]Easy maker key?
[328:31.37]A key to a crate of smuggled easy maker goods.
[328:37.47]Where's that?
[328:42.45]Depths?
[328:43.09]Oh, this is another shortcut somewhere.
[328:57.52]Good game design, but try patience.
[328:59.62]Is that a joke?
[329:00.10]Is that making fun of the game?
[329:01.20]Try patience.
[329:02.80]What?
[329:10.62]Oh, wait.
[329:11.28]This wraps back into here.
[329:23.49]Okay.
[329:24.93]But... No.
[329:26.57]No.
[329:28.86]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[329:32.95]Quest reward vault.
[329:42.08]Wasn't there a door in the starting area that was flickering?
[329:44.08]I think you're right.
[329:45.08]Oh, that's one way.
[330:01.22]That sound is getting louder.
[330:17.04]You know what's kind of cool about this game?
[330:19.99]It's scratching that FromSoftware itch.
[330:24.65]It just is.
[330:25.09]It's actually very well made.
[330:27.89]This is like really good.
[330:30.47]It's cool.
[330:31.21]This is a cool game.
[330:59.48]What's wrong with my... What's wrong with my weapon?
[331:02.76]What's wrong with my weapon?
[331:03.94]Why am I holding my weapon so weird?
[331:08.89]Um, why am I holding it like this?
[331:10.57]Okay, that was weird.
[331:27.14]Good.
[331:29.96]I like this area.
[331:50.64]Didn't see me right.
[331:57.79]Alright, the play here is wait till he turns around, go turn it on, and everybody will kill him.
[332:04.04]That's the plan.
[332:16.75]Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
[332:20.66]Everybody come out and fight.
[332:22.50]Fight.
[332:23.94]Yeah.
[332:24.74]Chaos.
[332:25.38]Chaos.
[332:26.59]Chaos.
[332:36.74]Oh shit.
[332:37.08]You all did it.
[332:50.08]I'm in trouble.
[333:01.23]I need a heal.
[333:01.97]A fridge?
[333:08.64]What?
[333:08.78]No.
[333:10.40]No.
[333:20.03]bucko blade the bucko blade is definitely strength yeah a pixelating really really really big sword my wielder was frequently sized up at a place where being stung was sought as a delight is it that little pink guy
[334:07.24]This is so dangerous right now.
[334:28.92]Get me out of here.
[334:37.28]They're following me.
[334:46.83]How did all of you make it out alive?
[334:48.83]He didn't kill one person?
[334:51.70]He's the hugest guy in this whole dungeon.
[334:54.42]How are you?
[334:55.24]Every single one of you is alive.
[334:59.23]Oh, there's a wall.
[335:00.31]There's a wall!
[335:01.43]Holy shit, I almost got hit.
[335:04.63]My heart just like stopped.
[335:05.61]My game.
[335:08.32]My game went down!
[335:09.06]I have to use the- Okay, I'm using literally the OBS preview to play the game.
[335:17.92]My game minimized.
[335:19.22]I can't see anything.
[335:19.92]It's on the OBS preview.
[335:24.35]Oh my god.
[335:25.17]How do I pause it?
[335:26.41]What happened?
[335:29.25]What?
[335:30.31]That was, okay, that was insane.
[335:34.61]I don't think you even saw that.
[335:36.13]That didn't translate.
[335:37.35]My game went down!
[335:43.98]How many layers are in this fucking dungeon?
[335:47.76]Nobody saw it?
[335:48.52]Weird.
[335:51.32]My game went down!
[335:52.70]Well, I'm putting this on.
[335:57.81]It's like, relax.
[336:11.52]Jeez.
[336:12.76]Bright.
[336:18.06]Oh my goodness.
[336:18.78]This like hurts my head.
[336:19.82]NPC?
[336:32.68]I think so.
[336:33.44]Yeah, it looks like I think it is Dragon Slayer.
[336:37.14]No!
[336:57.40]I impressed him accidentally.
[337:00.26]Everything's fine.
[337:01.66]Time for old Blade to face the chasm.
[337:05.25]No.
[337:05.99]What a sad ending that would have been.
[337:07.53]Don't serve my captors.
[337:08.91]Oh, I'm sorry.
[337:10.99]One of us.
[337:13.41]Never thought I'd meet a young spawn again.
[337:15.69]My game went down.
[337:17.37]They called me.
[337:19.51]Don't think about it too hard.
[337:21.28]I lost my courage, see?
[337:23.78]Lost my heroic icon with it.
[337:26.04]Listen.
[337:27.50]Icon.
[337:27.78]Do we have it already?
[337:46.16]Hmm.
[337:46.42]Do we not have his item?
[338:20.58]Well, somebody will... One of you guys please remember where this is.
[338:23.94]Because fuck, I will not.
[338:30.96]Dude, you're a walking Christmas tree.
[338:32.50]I think I look pretty cool.
[338:38.84]This is bad.
[338:40.25]And I think I'm going to... I think the plan is to just take one of the... Yeah, I'm gonna... Yeah.
[338:56.14]Maybe another time.
[339:06.83]You went really far back.
[339:08.87]It's really not...
[339:11.02]End of the stream voice?
[339:12.26]Hmm.
[339:12.74]Hmm.
[339:16.22]Yeah, it's probably a good place to stop.
[339:18.87]What the fuck?
[339:19.39]Why'd that guy say that?
[339:20.25]Don't tell the teacher we have homework.
[339:25.73]We are going to finish this.
[339:27.83]You will see this game be completed.
[339:32.13]Because I think it's really, really good.
[339:37.84]28 luck.
[339:38.90]Something new?
[339:44.23]Healing costs nothing.
[339:49.45]Cool.
[339:54.05]Yeah.
[339:55.63]From what I have gathered, I believe there's only probably... I think we're about halfway.
[340:01.90]The game's about 10 to 15 hours, depending on how slow you play.
[340:05.90]I don't know about completionist stuff, but it's probably like 12 to 15 hours.
[340:11.50]I would love to finish it.
[340:13.48]I think it's great.
[340:15.18]But that is not what is happening tomorrow.
[340:18.22]Although, it might.
[340:20.91]It might happen after.
[340:22.93]Tomorrow, I'm going to be playing Wild Hearts Sponsored.
[340:28.51]First sponsored stream of the year.
[340:30.15]It's been about three months or so.
[340:33.04]Looks really fun.
[340:33.72]I'm looking forward to it.
[340:35.02]Hey!
[340:38.54]Somebody... I am so sorry.
[340:40.38]Hey!
[340:49.40]But yeah, Vinny and I are going to be playing it.
[340:52.44]I think that's the idea.
[340:54.34]If there is any changes or any updates, I will let you know.
[340:57.08]Keep an eye on the sus.
[340:57.94]That's the plan for tomorrow at 6 p.m.
[340:59.74]And after that, I might just come back into this.
[341:03.99]We'll see.
[341:04.77]Or maybe we'll play that.
[341:05.63]Vinny and I might play it for longer.
[341:07.03]I don't know.
[341:09.65]We will figure that out tomorrow.
[341:11.25]But that's the plan.
[341:11.99]Sponsor stream tomorrow.
[341:14.94]And see you later.
[341:17.18]Can you give it a rating yet?
[341:20.48]I don't think you can... I don't know.
[341:22.30]You can't rate some stuff.
[341:26.01]I would tell you that this is worth playing.
[341:29.85]It's very good.
[341:32.35]I very much enjoy this game.
[341:34.79]In fact, I think it's great.
[341:40.55]But, I don't know.
[341:41.99]Oh, it's an 8.
[341:42.39]It's an 8.3.
[341:43.42]Nah, it's just great.
[341:45.06]It's just a great game.
[341:46.04]That's all you need to know.
[341:48.30]Seems like there's a lot of
[341:51.10]kind of depth somehow even though it's like a parody game it's very very good plays very well runs very well it's voice acting story seems pretty I'm I'm engaged I would like to know what's going on I think it's great there you go is my review in progress I think it's great
[342:19.93]And with that, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[342:21.05]6 p.m.
[342:22.17]Pacific.
[342:22.49]Let's check out Wild Hearts.
[342:28.28]Very cool.
[342:28.80]Do I have to save it or anything?
[342:31.84]Yes, okay.
[342:33.82]Uh-huh.
[342:36.14]See you tomorrow.
[342:40.17]Take care of yourselves.
[342:40.83]Call your mother.
[342:42.07]Drink some water.
[342:42.99]Eat a cup of broccoli.
[342:44.37]You know what to do.
[342:52.98]We need the music.
[342:53.69]That's right, you do.
[342:55.25]Let me get out of here first.
[342:57.15]There we go.
[342:57.47]Okay.
[342:58.15]Save and quit.
[343:04.47]Okay.
[343:06.15]And... Play us out.
[343:12.44]Is the entire stream going to be that one game?
[343:15.86]Probably not.
[343:19.28]Vinny and I will play Wild Hearts for a while.
[343:21.33]I don't know.
[343:22.31]If I'm having a great time, I probably just won't stop.
[343:26.85]What if I want to pivot at some point after I'm done with the sponsor?
[343:30.23]We'll see.
[343:39.78]Take care.
[343:40.12]Good night.
[343:41.46]Get some sleep.
[343:44.10]What about sorcery and frog detective?
[343:45.73]Well, I did promise frog detective would happen before the end of February.
[343:50.39]Or I was going to... I don't know.
[343:52.05]I was going to do something weird.
[343:54.47]So that will happen.
[344:02.43]Write the yoga stream down.
[344:03.93]I will.
[344:19.60]What about sorcery?
[344:22.40]I know.
[344:24.62]I gotta find a spot for it.
[344:34.11]There's a lot of games that I've just kept on the back burner for a long time.
[344:37.63]The goal is to play through most of them.
[344:38.99]Do you ever practice your voices?
[344:42.36]Yes, I do.
[344:44.08]On twitch.tv slash germa985 a couple times a week.
[344:50.58]Pretty much what you hear.
[344:52.24]What about Breath of the Wild?
[345:01.14]I will make sure to finish Breath of the Wild before the new one comes out.
[345:05.17]There's your other promise.
[345:06.93]Or I will... Alright, goodnight.
[345:15.91]Shameless plug.
[345:16.90]Yeah, sorry.
[345:17.40]I'm shouting out a Twitch channel here.
[345:21.97]Is there anywhere to suggest older games?
[345:23.86]There is a place for it.
[345:25.98]In the Discord, there's the Recommended channel.
[345:29.18]You have something you... A lot of... I mean, I think this game you're seeing right now, I took from Recommended a few months ago.
[345:35.96]I could be making that up, but I don't think I am.
[345:39.56]Yeah, I check it all the time.
[345:41.41]I always pull from it.
[345:48.94]Have a great night.
[345:49.60]See you tomorrow.
[345:50.80]Take care of yourselves.
[345:52.50]If for some reason we play through a lot more Wild Hearts tomorrow, then we will finish Last Hero of Nostalgia a day or two later.
[346:03.44]It'll be the next time we finish.
[346:04.22]Good night, guys.
[346:10.79]See you tomorrow.
[346:24.20]you
[346:59.08]you
