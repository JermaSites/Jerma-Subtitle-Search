[00:00.55]I typically greet everybody.
[00:03.97]And the live audience is who I typically greet, but today is going to be a little different.
[00:09.42]If you're watching the VOD right now, welcome to the VOD.
[00:12.62]Welcome to this piece of recorded content.
[00:16.10]Those of you that couldn't watch live, welcome to the stream.
[00:20.14]VOD watchers.
[00:24.59]Everybody else?
[00:28.02]You get greeted every day.
[00:29.94]Well, three days a week.
[00:31.18]Four days a week.
[00:33.57]Sometimes we have to reach out to the bot washers.
[00:36.71]So say hello to them right now.
[00:45.95]How you doing, guys?
[00:46.59]How are you?
[00:48.82]Welcome to another stream.
[00:53.38]I'm looking forward to this one.
[00:55.74]I did not realize what this game was until I really took a look at it.
[01:02.64]We're playing like a Chuck E. Cheese simulator today.
[01:06.24]This is gonna be probably my favorite game of the year.
[01:08.72]I'm not gonna lie.
[01:16.23]This is an arcade simulator where you go into an arcade and you try to win tickets.
[01:26.78]My voice sounds deeper?
[01:28.46]If it is, probably is.
[01:30.60]Sometimes I get a little froggy.
[01:33.50]It'll perk up, don't worry.
[01:38.65]I should play Garry's Mod.
[01:41.71]No.
[01:43.15]I played Garry's Mod like 15 times in like 2013.
[01:47.63]I think that was all I needed to do.
[01:50.53]You sound like you're about to cry.
[01:51.82]No, I sound like a broadcaster in the car
[01:58.89]Maybe I should try out for NPR.
[02:03.52]We all know the criteria for trying out for NPR.
[02:07.02]Or being on NPR.
[02:08.56]It's sounding like you're just a little too close to your microphone.
[02:15.47]I should get the job.
[02:22.27]Anyways, it's called The Coin Game.
[02:23.71]I am a little froggy this afternoon, ain't I?
[02:27.95]I promise I wasn't at like a football game yesterday screaming.
[02:34.57]That's what I did on my days off, yeah.
[02:38.56]I had painted my whole body the color of the team and just was screaming at the other team.
[02:43.72]But anyways, uh... Tomorrow, there's no stream tomorrow.
[02:49.38]Because I have a meeting tomorrow for the carnival stream.
[02:54.02]So that is really picking up now.
[03:03.96]So we'll go along today.
[03:11.31]Chat is moving so fast.
[03:12.63]Chat's moving so fast, it really is.
[03:15.97]But I do want to reiterate one more time something I mentioned a couple weeks ago is that streams are gonna have to pull back a little over the next four to six weeks.
[03:26.58]I'm trying to do double time here on this.
[03:29.22]But there's a lot of moving parts on this stream in particular
[03:32.66]that I'm going to give you the company explanation as to why there's gonna be like three streams a week rather than four.
[03:39.32]Company explanation, very... Hold on, let me get close to the mic to make sure this is really taken for real here.
[03:46.37]Company consideration.
[03:48.31]Reasons why.
[03:49.91]Thank you for listening.
[03:52.39]Anywho, let's go.
[03:54.87]I've already tweeted.
[03:56.01]I've already got like the fucking frog voice.
[03:58.99]Here it is, the coin game.
[04:04.58]The footlong sub is no longer $5?
[04:06.84]I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Subway is going to close forever, within 10 years.
[04:19.89]I'm just telling you that this is what I think to be the truth.
[04:23.42]So instead of, oh, the footlong sub is gone, Subway is going to be gone.
[04:28.40]It's not going to happen.
[04:30.72]Trust me.
[04:36.62]Ten years from now.
[04:38.16]They'll get replaced by Bank of Americas.
[04:40.22]Don't worry.
[04:42.09]Here we go.
[04:43.91]Choose your player.
[04:44.69]Hold on.
[04:45.01]Male clothing.
[04:45.67]Let's see.
[04:46.63]Can I have different bank of clothing?
[04:52.43]That's me.
[04:55.13]There's a locked button.
[04:57.96]I've got to get the unlockable clothes.
[05:02.16]Well, that's not... Without the glasses, that's me.
[05:08.26]I don't wear... I'm... No, I don't do horizontal stripes.
[05:10.84]I'm just white t-shirt and jeans guy.
[05:14.37]Yeah, that's fine.
[05:16.95]Uh, birthday mode?
[05:19.60]Wait, there's a survival mode and a birthday mode.
[05:23.62]A birthday party just for you.
[05:26.02]Fun and relax so you can just play the games.
[05:28.32]When money runs out, just hit up the money grabber.
[05:31.54]Teleport around island from smartwatch.
[05:34.94]No health?
[05:35.62]What do you mean there's health?
[05:37.34]No curfews or parents?
[05:45.30]Oh no, it's not ready!
[05:53.21]In survival, you work odd jobs to scavenge to earn money, pawn your prizes to get cash.
[06:00.61]My parents just don't understand.
[06:04.46]Your rich uncle Phil has rented the arcade and you can act like the brats that you are.
[06:08.46]Go ahead, money's no object.
[06:11.56]Also, feel free to check out the entire island in your... Stop!
[06:14.49]Hey!
[06:16.49]Kids.
[06:18.39]Relax.
[06:20.31]Everybody's gonna get five dollars worth of tokens.
[06:23.85]There's no reason to scream.
[06:25.41]No one's going to get any more than anybody else.
[06:29.85]Alright, now settle down.
[06:31.83]That's when you throw all the tokens in the air.
[06:34.84]And, like, all the kids are like, ah!
[06:36.54]They start freaking out.
[06:37.28]Everyone's trying to grab as many as they can.
[06:42.98]See?
[06:43.08]Alright, let's go.
[06:48.07]Does it delete any saves?
[06:49.25]Ah!
[06:56.07]Oh, that's fine.
[06:59.06]Let's rile up these kids.
[07:01.52]Okay, kids.
[07:02.66]Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:03.68]Everyone's going to get the same amount of tokens, except for there's going to be one person that gets 10 extra tokens.
[07:09.68]If they can scream the loudest, starting right now.
[07:14.93]I could rile up people.
[07:21.97]It's like, the person you don't... I'm the person that the parents are like... The worker at the place is just like... Hold on.
[07:29.37]This is the worker.
[07:32.19]Happy birthday.
[07:33.09]Rowdy.
[07:33.61]Enter here.
[07:39.34]Grab?
[07:40.36]Wait, this is a... New text message.
[07:42.42]Tab is to look at your text.
[07:44.40]Happy birthday, kid!
[07:47.27]Hey, thank you for purchasing the coin game.
[07:48.87]We're extremely grateful for... Oh, this is Uncle Phil.
[07:51.71]Being a new favorite time waster.
[07:53.59]You can always refer to this menu for all your received messages and all info about the current game.
[07:57.65]Below this message, you'll find a small helper message that explains a little about how to use the player controller in machines.
[08:03.18]If you enjoy the game, please consider giving it a positive review on the Steam store page and help further development of the coin game through early access development.
[08:10.32]Thanks, Uncle Phil.
[08:14.75]I ain't clicking that.
[08:18.09]I'm not going to click that.
[08:20.75]Smartwatch tutorial.
[08:21.57]Let's just take a look at this real quick.
[08:24.95]You've obviously found the smartwatch menu and know how to read the messages.
[08:27.68]Here you will find five menus that will help you through your coin game.
[08:29.66]Okay.
[08:30.34]So the info menu.
[08:32.36]So the top left to check the balance of your health.
[08:34.40]Remaining curfew time and job.
[08:35.74]We don't need to do that.
[08:36.54]That's not in the game yet.
[08:38.20]Coin balance, tickets, and bus pass balances.
[08:41.88]Okay.
[08:42.12]So that's like our top left.
[08:43.28]This one's balance.
[08:44.90]That's really all we need to know because we're on birthday mode.
[08:49.11]You must eat and drink to keep this up through the day or you will die.
[08:56.62]Why can you die in this game?
[09:00.58]That seems a little much, I'm gonna say.
[09:05.59]Yeah, yeah, we don't- this is all survival stuff.
[09:07.51]We're not doing that.
[09:08.55]It's not ready.
[09:09.75]Alright, this is the messages.
[09:10.59]This menu will write- it'll store all the messages from the game.
[09:14.11]You cannot delete them, right?
[09:15.95]Map menu.
[09:16.60]This is the top-down mini-map of the whole island.
[09:18.80]I'm gonna click it.
[09:25.44]What?
[09:28.92]Why is this so big?
[09:35.19]This seems very elaborate.
[09:39.89]Larry's Arcade.
[09:41.01]Okay, well, so that's... Hold on.
[09:46.73]Uh, yeah, it has all the major locations marked for you to explore, including your current position and the current position of the Islandville bus, and all seven bus stops on the island.
[09:55.37]You can also check the progress of delivering papers by checking the amount of red mailboxes that have yet to be delivered.
[10:02.22]Okay.
[10:04.49]12-spot inventory backpack for you to carry things around the island.
[10:07.15]Simply click the pick up button on an object to add it to your inventory.
[10:11.07]Right?
[10:11.71]And then click the image of it in your inventory menu to drop it.
[10:15.33]Okay.
[10:17.58]Simple.
[10:17.98]Once it is full, you have to drop an item in order to have a new one.
[10:21.24]And then these are stats.
[10:23.26]Got it?
[10:24.40]Uncle Phil, you need some more money.
[10:26.76]You need some more money.
[10:30.04]If you run out of money, you can always go into the VIP birthday room and get them in the free money blower machine.
[10:36.46]I took care of Larry and told him to make sure it is full whenever you need any money.
[10:44.51]What the fuck?
[10:48.78]Imagine being like the janitor here.
[10:53.60]And you just see the kid- Hey, hey, uh, hey, janitor, uh, Joe.
[10:59.54]Yeah?
[11:00.58]You gotta fill up the money machine.

[11:08.16]Okay.
[11:12.62]Like, what?

[11:25.29]Barry's Pawn Shop.
[11:28.75]Come on down to Barry's Pawn Shop, located at the flashing yellow light in the main hallway.
[11:32.29]Main highway.

[12:21.47]Oh yeah, it's a full letter grade already.
[12:23.28]That's cool.

[12:32.32]How old am I supposed to be?
[12:33.78]I can zoom out?
[12:39.74]Press tab to lean forward.

[16:37.20]Wait.
[16:38.58]That thing's moving around.
[16:40.78]Can I take the truck?
[16:47.80]If I can drive this truck, that'd be pretty awesome, actually.
[16:49.98]Oh, I can't drive the truck?

[18:04.46]Oh, I love this.
[18:05.30]This is awesome.
[18:07.24]I wanted to go to, like, Dave and Buster's, too.
[18:10.14]I was thinking about it.
[18:12.18]I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese.
[18:13.08]There's, like, five Chuck E. Cheeses.
[18:16.76]Alright, which one do I want to do first?
[18:17.80]I don't have to go anywhere.
[18:18.74]This is perfect.
[18:19.24]Okay.
[18:23.39]How do I play?
[18:24.73]I have to scan my Chuck E. Cheese card.
[18:28.64]Am I supposed to be a robot?
[18:29.64]Yeah, I don't... I... No.
[18:31.64]I have, like, normal hands.
[18:34.44]Alright, so... What's that?
[18:36.22]I got 50 bucks?
[18:38.00]How much does it cost to play?
[18:39.80]A dollar to play?
[18:40.70]Shit.
[18:44.66]Here we go.
[18:48.49]20 tickets.
[18:53.87]50 ticket!
[18:54.33]I did it.
[19:01.98]That was very, very loud.
[19:03.26]That hurt my head.
[19:05.58]Uh, try again.
[19:06.84]No.
[19:07.92]I'm gonna flip.
[19:08.92]Let me see the other ones.
[19:11.18]So how many tickets do I have?
[19:13.46]How did I get zero?
[19:24.66]70 tickets.
[19:29.68]Alright, hold on.
[19:35.86]I'm gonna get stuck here.
[19:36.72]I know I am.
[19:37.38]But let me, like, drop that audio.
[19:38.94]It's too loud.
[19:41.87]Whoa, sound effects?
[19:44.29]That shit was just out of control.
[19:48.27]What about this one?
[19:50.56]How much is this one?
[19:51.70]Drop coin with E. Aim.
[19:53.78]This is just one of the coin-pushing games.
[19:57.12]I'm gonna irritate people so much, because I'm never gonna leave.
[20:00.90]I remember Kim and I one time went to an arcade, and we became, like, psychotically obsessed with these machines.
[20:11.53]We sat there for, like, three hours.
[20:14.97]Okay, so, where do I want to go?
[20:16.23]I want to get the money thing, right?
[20:20.92]What do you mean we?
[20:21.56]Yeah, no, no, that was very much a we scenario.
[20:33.77]How can you be bad at the coin game?
[20:35.49]I'm not bad.
[20:35.93]What do you mean bad at coin game?
[20:37.45]How many credits?
[20:40.77]How much did this cost?
[20:41.43]A dollar?
[20:50.07]There's a game show in the UK based off of these coins.
[21:01.16]It's stuck!
[21:02.00]I have to- How do I shake the machine?
[21:04.30]Can I punch the machine?
[21:05.20]Alright, here we go.
[21:12.66]I have to get at least one satisfying push.
[21:15.11]Fuck.
[21:15.79]It's gonna take a while.
[21:17.69]I gotta get bingo.
[21:24.77]There it is.
[21:27.21]Singo?
[21:28.93]That makes... What?
[21:31.09]Oh, it's coins.
[21:33.10]Coins.
[21:36.50]Yeah, that's what I meant to say.
[21:40.82]Coins.
[21:41.58]Alright, hold on.
[21:42.06]Here we go.
[21:42.28]This is gonna be satisfying.
[21:43.08]Watch this.
[21:46.80]Almost.
[21:50.26]I gotta tell Kim about this one.
[21:55.25]Come on, get it.
[21:59.29]Come on!
[22:04.22]I gotta get that S. I'm not gonna leave until I hit the S. Wait, this might be good.
[22:10.06]Got it.
[22:11.02]Five bucks.
[22:13.72]It only just crunches as loud as it can in your ear.
[22:23.23]Okay, we're good.
[22:26.76]A $5 bill in there.
[22:29.08]I'm just holding the tickets.
[22:30.18]Alright, I didn't get the S, so I... Final push.
[22:36.11]No, no, no, no, no!
[22:36.91]Put the money back in!
[22:37.57]I want to do it again.
[22:43.91]Do it again.
[22:47.72]Yes.
[22:48.36]Okay.
[22:50.24]I'm up right now.
[22:53.10]I want to get the stapler, whatever that is.
[22:57.39]Get the fidget spinner.
[22:58.49]I'm gonna... I'm gonna clean this whole thing up.
[23:03.14]I need that S. Give me the S. Give me the S!
[23:15.14]I just need the S so that I can move on.
[23:17.84]After I get the fidget spinner.
[23:25.07]Okay, here we go.
[23:26.51]Oh, man.
[23:27.35]Oh, man.
[23:30.63]Oh, man.
[23:31.41]Oh, man.
[23:33.63]40 tickets.
[23:36.83]Alright, what's that?
[23:37.33]A walkie-talkie?
[23:40.95]Yeah, it is really fucking loud.
[23:42.41]I'm gonna do you guys a favor here.
[23:43.73]Hold on.
[23:48.45]I'm turning it way fucking down.
[23:50.29]Like, way down.
[23:51.69]And then I'm gonna turn the music up.
[23:59.95]That should help.
[24:06.95]How's that?
[24:07.33]Better?
[24:16.81]Now is it too low?
[24:22.92]How about that?
[24:26.80]That's probably a little bit better.
[24:29.86]Wait, wait, where was I going to get the lighter?
[24:32.98]Why is there a Zippo lighter in like a kid's Chuck E. Cheese?
[24:35.36]I don't understand that.
[24:41.07]$2.50.
[24:42.25]Alright, let me get the fidget spinner and then we can get out of here.
[24:45.69]Let me get coins one more time.
[24:53.37]It's so the kids can smoke.
[24:57.91]I'm going to get a lot from here.
[25:00.53]Nice.
[25:00.85]Come on.
[25:03.55]Do it.
[25:04.75]Ugh.
[25:05.17]Do it again.
[25:10.96]Lighter?
[25:11.58]It's a... What do you mean lighter?
[25:16.06]It's a... No.
[25:17.20]That's like a nail file.
[25:19.78]The other thing was a lighter.
[25:22.85]Got it.
[25:23.45]Okay.
[25:23.77]Something big.
[25:26.27]It's not that big.
[25:29.47]Just put the lighter back up there.
[25:30.63]Did I take it?
[25:32.15]I need the fidget spinner, or chat will literally never let me leave.
[25:37.43]Don't you understand, guys?
[25:39.07]This community, if I don't get the fidget spinner, six months from now, someone's going to have their username be Jerma lied about the fidget spinner.
[25:49.60]You understand?
[25:50.96]Like, people will say, hey, when are you going to get the fidget spinner?
[25:53.34]Are you going to, like, go back to the coin machine and get the fidget spinner?
[25:56.34]And I'll be like, no.
[26:01.47]And it'll just become a thing.
[26:02.67]I have to get that.
[26:08.37]It's already taken.
[26:10.59]So you see somebody is preparing.
[26:12.79]There's no way in hell that somebody could have made that username as fast as I just said that.
[26:19.59]So somebody was already preparing.
[26:22.25]My point has been proven.
[26:29.42]I don't even need to say anything else.
[26:31.84]I just have to get this stupid fucking fidget spinner.
[26:41.39]Oh, that was, that was the mother log.
[26:45.15]How many, how many tickets was that?
[26:54.78]Alright, I almost got it.
[26:56.24]Almost got it.
[26:56.88]There it is.
[26:57.42]It's right there.
[26:57.90]It's so close.
[27:01.33]Got it!
[27:02.05]Yeah!
[27:02.73]Alright, now nobody can say shit.
[27:04.83]Now you gotta remake another username.
[27:16.52]Get the knife?
[27:16.98]I already got the knife!
[27:23.08]That's just hanging on... Hold on, look at this.
[27:26.10]How many tickets are coming out?
[27:34.51]I just want to get the middle one.
[27:35.87]I don't even care.
[27:38.81]It's a dollar.
[27:40.01]I have $55.
[27:40.59]I'm just gonna spam.
[27:42.27]I got it.
[27:42.57]Okay.
[27:42.71]I got it.
[27:42.97]That's all I wanted.
[27:45.05]I don't want anything else.
[27:51.65]By the way, this is the worst strategy when you're playing one of these machines.
[27:54.13]I'm gonna get coins again though.
[27:57.49]Alright.
[27:57.88]Something big.
[28:00.71]Oh my fucking god, oh my fucking god, I did it!
[28:15.77]Okay, let me see if I can get the middle lighter again.
[28:20.83]Strategic drops here.
[28:28.46]Got it.
[28:28.82]Come on.
[28:29.20]Look at that.
[28:29.60]Look at that perfect drop.
[28:38.93]Pretty good, I think.
[28:40.47]I think I cleaned out that one.
[28:42.63]Alright, what else is there?
[28:46.08]Cool.
[28:46.28]How much money do I have?
[28:47.54]60 bucks?
[28:48.16]I got more than what I came in with.
[28:50.68]My investment in Chuck E. Cheese is going pretty well.
[28:55.67]Oh, shit.
[28:56.27]Right.
[28:56.45]How many tickets?
[28:59.77]That's a lot.
[29:05.27]I literally played Big Bass as a kid.
[29:07.55]Yeah.
[29:09.63]What does he say?
[29:10.29]What is it?
[29:10.79]I got it in my head somewhere.
[29:11.77]It's in there somewhere.
[29:13.95]Oh, yeah.
[29:14.32]That's a good fish now.
[29:15.98]Something like that.
[29:16.72]What is it?
[29:17.02]It's here somewhere.
[29:17.88]Let me find it.
[29:21.34]Come on.
[29:21.84]It's in there somewhere.
[29:25.00]Oh, don't you know that's going to be a big pull now?
[29:27.12]It's going to happen.
[29:27.90]Just trust me.
[29:28.30]It was something like that.
[29:28.96]Did I do it?
[29:42.21]Pull the handle.
[29:42.83]Oh.
[29:52.83]15 tickets, come on.
[29:54.03]This thing's expensive, too.
[29:55.29]It's always the most expensive thing in the whole arcade.
[29:58.17]How much is it?
[29:59.03]It's a dollar?
[30:00.35]Alright, let's do it again.
[30:10.00]Oh, you got yourself 40 tickets?
[30:11.94]I'm gonna find it on YouTube and I'll play it.
[30:16.22]Oh, 40 tickets?
[30:16.86]Don't you know?
[30:19.71]No, this game's a scam.
[30:20.59]Fuck this game.
[30:33.48]No, I don't want to see an actual big bass.
[30:45.73]Let's see if I was right.
[30:50.39]Does it?
[30:51.33]Come on.
[30:52.39]Let's see what she can do here.
[30:53.91]Okay, let's keep an eye on things.
[30:57.99]This YouTube channel is about playing arcade games?
[31:00.25]I didn't even know that.
[31:01.69]Big bass bass.
[31:03.00]Arcade voice
[31:51.76]Oh, you got 100 tickets?
[31:53.36]I was right.
[32:03.58]No, no, I'm not playing that one again.
[32:04.62]Give me my tickets and let's get the hell out of here.
[32:06.91]I remember this one.
[32:07.61]Wait, we gotta go in order.
[32:09.25]I can't just run around like a child.
[32:12.13]In order.
[32:16.09]Treasure in the sand?
[32:19.89]50 cent for one.
[32:20.75]I've never played this one before.
[32:25.70]How does this one work?
[32:28.72]Use joystick to move arm and knock off coins.
[32:32.66]Like...
[32:47.48]Just like a bunch of hit markers.
[32:49.54]I just called in like the AC-130 in Call of Duty.
[33:02.02]Okay.
[33:05.56]Game sucks.
[33:06.02]I don't want to play it again.
[33:07.72]Dumb.
[33:10.14]Ooh, don't go.
[33:11.80]What do they got here?
[33:12.40]Hmm.
[33:15.08]It's a coin machine.
[33:15.98]I like that one.
[33:28.52]I'm just gonna get the cards, and I'll be fine.
[33:32.07]It's another one.
[33:32.67]Yeah, but these ones are fun.
[33:38.01]I can only get one dunko for three cards, and then I won't do it ever again.
[33:46.02]Come on!
[33:46.58]Give me the dew!
[33:48.86]Got it.
[33:49.12]Got the end.
[33:51.40]Oh.
[33:51.92]Perfect.
[33:59.39]Yes!
[33:59.55]Alright, 500.
[34:02.19]I'll take 60 tickets.
[34:03.05]That sounds good to me now.
[34:07.23]Be a good sport!
[34:08.13]Play again!
[34:09.45]He does that too.
[34:11.03]We might have to listen to that.
[34:25.76]Oh, you got eight tickets now.
[34:32.76]But honestly though, that machine, fuck that machine.
[34:35.82]That machine's stupid.
[34:37.38]Not because it's in this game.
[34:38.42]Like, it's cool to have that in the game.
[34:40.15]That thing is always like six bucks.
[34:43.69]It's like four to six dollars to spend that thing.
[34:47.53]At every arcade I've ever been to.
[34:49.53]Alright, I'm gonna get them all.
[34:54.58]Right here.
[34:59.04]You know, they make these for adults in Vegas.
[35:00.82]They don't make this shit like this in a slot machine.
[35:05.28]If this was real money, that would be pretty fucking fun.
[35:10.24]No, I don't want to sit there and spin, like, the one cent machine.
[35:12.69]I want to put, like, quarters in here and have the quarters come out.
[35:15.35]Oh, come on.
[35:23.39]What'd I get?
[35:25.39]Dunk again.
[35:26.25]Yeah.
[35:26.53]But what did I get?
[35:27.69]What was that?
[35:29.33]Is it just eight tickets?
[35:31.29]Eight tickets?
[35:45.18]Yeah, I know about pachinko machines, but... Is... I'll... I'll... Hold on.
[35:57.01]Alright.
[36:00.16]Aren't Pachinko... Can't you not do it with real money?
[36:04.30]Isn't it kind of like you pay and you get like these balls and you can get... You can essentially do the... It's like ticket redemption.
[36:13.66]Yeah.
[36:14.79]Imagine these were just like silver dollars in here.
[36:17.81]And you got them.
[36:29.40]I don't know what those are doing.
[36:30.99]Alright, let me go for this last one.
[36:38.41]Yeah, some casinos in Vegas still have the old coin machines.
[36:42.29]But they're not a thing anymore.
[36:48.42]Come on.
[36:49.82]Shit.
[36:50.64]Alright, I'm giving up.
[36:51.24]I don't care about it.
[36:52.88]No, I don't care.
[36:53.34]I don't care.
[36:54.02]Look, I set it up for somebody else.
[36:56.06]Some lucky kid's gonna come over and get that.
[37:04.61]No, I've set it up for somebody.
[37:07.59]Alright, let me look at my inventory.
[37:10.13]I have an empty backpack.
[37:14.77]How's that possible?
[37:15.43]Anything good?
[37:18.57]No?
[37:18.93]Alright, what's this?
[37:21.03]Oh, that's rankings.
[37:22.49]There's a ranking system?
[37:38.62]Hold on, guys.
[37:39.08]I'm trying to open a jar.
[37:40.88]Hold on.
[37:44.72]I can't.
[37:45.18]I can't do it.
[37:46.84]I'm trying.
[37:52.39]Kim came in.
[37:52.95]She wanted me to open a jar for her because I'm strong.
[37:55.21]But I'm not strong enough, apparently.
[37:56.39]I'm trying.
[38:00.55]No, I can do this.
[38:01.92]And I'm going to do it.
[38:02.54]Hold on.
[38:04.06]I need a grip.
[38:08.38]Fuck.
[38:12.74]Give me that, give me that thing.
[38:14.46]Face cam, I don't have any clothes on.
[38:15.58]I can't put a face cam on.
[38:17.60]I'm gonna get this.
[38:27.31]I got it!
[38:28.69]Alright, you're welcome.
[38:32.58]That was fucking impossible.
[38:37.47]Alright, what would Mountain Dew?
[38:38.65]Is that what we're gonna get?
[38:45.72]Something like that.
[38:51.92]How much do these cost?
[38:53.40]Wait, I can get one of these?
[38:54.66]I can actually... Can I drink them?
[38:58.06]Oh, which one?
[39:00.67]I always go right in the middle.
[39:02.93]Because for some reason, everybody that uses these machines, they either do the first two, or they do the bottom two.
[39:09.52]So, you know how you get, that's not that, wait, hold on, I'm just coming to a realization here.
[39:13.16]If nobody presses the middle button, doesn't that mean that the freshest ones are not in the middle?
[39:21.00]You should always do the top one, because that's the one that gets filled, right?
[39:26.69]Fuck, I've been doing it wrong the whole time.
[39:32.54]Jesus.
[39:43.37]Well, you slammed that one.
[39:46.65]Do you guys do redemption here?
[39:48.05]Can I get five cents for this?
[39:52.99]What the hell?
[39:53.55]Oh, no, no, no.
[39:53.99]I'm not ready for that yet.
[39:55.65]One point.
[39:56.19]Ticket.
[39:56.45]Oh, wait.
[39:56.88]Ticket redemption center.
[39:59.27]Oh yeah, that's right.
[39:59.81]You put this in, and then you feed the tickets in.
[40:07.75]969 tickets.
[40:08.77]Cool.
[40:09.60]Alright.
[40:16.92]Oh no, not this thing again.
[40:19.64]This... That thing seriously ruined my entire childhood.
[40:25.78]Prize Master.
[40:29.06]Wait, there's a show going on in there?
[40:32.98]Not yet, not yet.
[40:33.60]Hold on.
[40:33.90]Wait, I need to play the games first.
[40:36.64]Oh, isn't it?
[40:36.98]Yeah, this is the one where you have to push the thing perfectly into the slot, right?
[40:40.62]Okay, let's try it.
[40:49.86]How does he... How do you start it?
[40:54.22]Start it.
[41:02.08]How do I go up?
[41:03.30]Oh.
[41:04.24]What?
[41:06.38]No, no, no, no.
[41:07.14]Okay, so you have to move it, and then you have to hold to, and then you have to release.
[41:10.60]Alright, let's do it again.
[41:22.18]Right there.
[41:24.08]Shit.
[41:24.61]That was not even close.
[41:31.78]This is fucking expensive.
[41:33.06]This is really expensive.
[41:34.52]One more.
[41:59.12]Get it?
[41:59.44]It's right there.
[42:06.21]I can do it.
[42:07.69]This is actually the worst machine in the whole entire arcade play.
[42:10.35]It really is.
[42:11.92]They also do have one where you blow up a balloon and you never play that one either.
[42:18.56]I don't even know why that's in the arcade.
[42:20.48]No one touches it.
[42:21.10]I think that's it.
[42:26.37]I got it.
[42:31.35]How much is it?
[42:32.47]How many tickets?
[42:41.65]Oh, no.
[42:41.96]I don't want to play again.
[42:46.56]100 tickets.
[42:47.40]What a dogshit prize.
[42:48.62]For five bucks?
[42:58.88]Just wait till you guys get the chance to play this one.
[43:04.84]I can't wait for that.
[43:05.94]It's gonna be so much fun.
[43:07.04]Alright, let's go 500 right here.
[43:18.99]You gotta let me do the thing where I turn and look into the side like everybody does.
[43:24.83]I think that's it.
[43:27.65]I think I got it.
[43:30.54]Which one is that?
[43:31.08]Ten tickets?
[43:33.88]Come on.
[43:35.06]Do it again.
[43:47.71]Just watch the edge.
[43:48.53]I should be able to get it.
[44:00.49]Well, I broke it.
[44:01.17]Uh, I broke it.
[44:09.26]Hey, I got a free game.
[44:10.96]You notice that?
[44:20.62]I'm gonna get that one right there.
[44:22.38]500 tickets.
[44:24.74]I got it.
[44:26.48]Oh, sick.
[44:30.39]Thank you!
[44:31.97]Why am I doing this so many times?
[44:33.81]How many times am I going to do this?
[44:40.68]Another 500?
[44:41.06]Five hundred.
[44:41.50]Thousand.
[44:46.46]This seems easier than it should be.
[44:50.72]There's a hundred over here.
[44:53.42]Why do I get to do this so many times?
[44:59.25]Give me the hundred.
[45:05.43]The claw is actually clawing things, I know.
[45:07.13]Weird, right?
[45:11.13]Wait, what?
[45:11.47]I have to actually pick them out of here?
[45:19.05]Get out of... It is!
[45:20.39]It's 500!
[45:20.93]It IS 500!
[45:21.71]You guys thought it said... I just... It's 500!
[45:26.11]Get out of here.
[45:28.11]Somebody just said that's five.
[45:29.97]No, it was 500.
[45:31.13]Get out of here!
[45:31.87]It's my birthday, not yours.
[45:38.52]I know this one, too.
[45:39.42]This one's awful.
[45:41.94]Okay, let's do this one.
[45:45.07]Same deal, but with rings.
[45:46.29]Let's try to get 100 in the corner.
[45:54.09]I think no.
[45:55.81]No?
[45:57.60]Well, I'll take 25.
[45:58.12]You piece of shit.
[46:05.19]I'm just gonna go in.
[46:05.93]I'm gonna try to feed it through the middle of these two right here.
[46:09.59]There's a 50 right there, too.
[46:10.65]It might work.
[46:11.07]Let's ring it through.
[46:13.37]Come on, get like four of them.
[46:18.79]Oh, this is a freakout scenario.
[46:20.21]If I was a kid... You pick up three things at the same time, you are more likely to get struck by lightning than have that happen to a claw game.
[46:40.82]Nice.
[46:41.18]Alright.
[46:45.57]Should be able to feed through.
[46:48.21]What's the green?
[46:49.23]Is the green 500?
[46:49.81]Oh, shit.
[46:52.73]Alright.
[46:52.93]I'll take the 100.
[46:54.40]The green's 500.
[46:56.24]Get the green.
[46:57.74]Oh.
[46:59.16]No.
[46:59.72]No more.
[47:00.18]I got enough money.
[47:06.40]Yeah, this one sucks.
[47:07.62]I'm gonna get stuck here for, like, at least 20 minutes.
[47:10.54]This is the one where you have to gently tap the spring to make it so it almost gets all the way, but doesn't go all the way.
[47:24.03]So how do I do it?
[47:30.01]Where the hell?
[47:30.75]Where did it go?
[47:31.17]Can I get a better view?
[47:34.25]I want a better view of this.
[47:36.11]Okay.
[47:42.21]How to play.
[47:42.95]Find the green light.
[47:44.05]That's where you want to... Okay, the green light.
[47:48.24]Press and hold.
[47:50.02]Green lights up.
[47:50.70]I can't even see it.
[47:51.36]Okay.
[48:05.02]Do it again.
[48:08.42]Yeah, you want it to land on the... Okay, you want it to land right there.
[48:13.18]But I also want to be able to... I want a better view.
[48:15.88]Get it!
[48:19.24]Get it!
[48:19.48]Oh, that's too bad.
[48:21.62]Do it again.
[48:24.98]It's all the way up.
[48:29.82]Oh, shit.
[48:30.38]Too much.
[48:32.90]Another hundred tickets.
[48:38.17]I like this one.
[48:39.72]Where's the green?
[48:43.90]Where is it?
[48:44.22]On the other side?
[48:45.08]Alright, it's like in the middle top right.
[48:46.66]Alright, 20 seconds, I'll take it.
[48:56.19]How much money do I have?
[48:57.17]Alright, right there.
[49:00.01]Alright, come on, ready?
[49:00.77]No!
[49:11.36]I have to get it at least once.
[49:13.89]Right there again.
[49:14.45]100.
[49:16.25]It's fine.
[49:24.04]I can probably do this noise perfectly.
[49:31.68]I'm getting a lot of tickets though.
[49:33.18]It's 2,500 tickets.
[49:41.48]Damn it!
[49:42.30]Too hard.
[49:45.58]Make the noise.
[49:46.30]I'll try.
[49:46.86]I gotta get away from the mic.
[49:49.69]This is gonna be loud.
[50:03.55]The first one was perfect.
[50:20.88]Come on.
[50:22.14]I have to get this one time, or I refuse to move on until I do this.
[50:27.10]You understand?
[50:27.54]Do you understand?
[50:42.16]I will call Uncle Phil and have him deposit five grand into my checking account.
[50:53.32]That sound is easy to make.
[50:54.40]You just have to go...
[51:07.79]Uncle Phil.
[51:09.93]Look at this shit.
[51:14.09]It was always so fun to see that.
[51:15.43]You always got jealous of that motherfucker.
[51:17.71]When you walked by and that person was sitting there with their hands on their hips like, oh yeah, while the thing just spit out hundreds of these tickets.
[51:26.66]Like, I primed that.
[51:27.66]I prepped that fucking thing for you.
[51:34.33]And it takes like 20 minutes, and they don't even pick them up.
[51:36.99]They just let them pile up like this.
[51:51.52]Guys, it's 2,500 tickets.
[51:54.18]I have to do that.
[51:54.86]I have to get the PlayStation 4.
[52:03.74]Ah, come on!
[52:08.71]Come on, I just need to do this once.
[52:12.09]Same spot, a little bit harder.
[52:16.73]That's the one.
[52:19.57]No, it's not.
[52:20.39]I had it.
[52:21.19]That's the easiest one to get.
[52:22.47]Okay.
[52:35.71]Behind the green light.
[52:37.78]Right there.
[52:38.38]Oh!
[52:41.88]I have to do this.
[53:14.88]Who cares?
[53:16.48]I care.
[53:17.04]I do.
[53:23.64]It's not even close.
[53:30.66]Imagine going into an arcade and I'm standing there.
[53:35.42]I'm hogging the machine right now.
[53:36.92]There are children that want to play this.
[53:40.18]Children.
[53:43.02]And I'm, like, leaning in and, like, lifting my legs up.
[53:45.43]Oh, whoa, almost.
[53:52.73]Can I try?
[53:53.75]Just turn and look at him.
[54:02.62]I can get this.
[54:03.20]I can do this.
[54:05.20]Excuse me, sir.
[54:06.96]Can I play?
[54:07.80]Can I turn and just fucking yell that over there?
[54:22.72]I don't even know where it is.
[54:40.35]You... What a psycho.
[54:44.67]Going in... How much money do I have left?
[54:53.32]What kind of, like, sicko millionaire, like, goes in here with, like, 500 bucks to... No, I've got to hit the green.
[54:59.02]I've got to do it.
[55:00.43]I don't give a shit about this.
[55:01.45]This is just not even real currency.
[55:03.11]I don't care.
[55:06.01]I plan on just walking by and throwing this in the trash.
[55:26.59]Just a few more.
[55:27.35]You can afford a Tootsie Roll and an Eraser.
[55:29.21]Yeah, I can get a box of Nerds.
[55:34.60]Don't worry, guys.
[55:35.68]Only 8 grand worth of these gets you the PlayStation 4.
[55:42.71]Oh, I can also get a sticky hand, too.
[55:44.61]Why have arcade, even like Dave & Buster's does this, and I don't know why, is there some kind of weird racket?
[55:50.09]Weird, like, cornered market with ticket prizes?
[55:53.76]It's always, like, fucking sticky hands?
[55:56.08]Tootsie rolls.
[55:57.76]Like, the finger traps.
[56:00.18]Shitty stuffed animals.
[56:03.42]And weird alcoholic joke shit that nobody ever uses.
[56:08.51]Get yourself a upside-down, inside-out shot glass.
[56:17.10]I don't want that.
[56:17.68]What do you mean, what?
[56:27.38]The ones that, like, it's... The top is... Look, it looks like an hourglass.
[56:34.56]It's empty at the top, empty at the bottom.
[56:37.36]You flip it, you can take a shot either way.
[56:39.98]It's real jokey.
[56:43.00]You guys have never seen that before?
[56:44.64]What are you talking about?
[56:49.75]This is the one.
[56:52.37]That's the one.
[56:52.97]That's the one.
[56:53.55]This is the one!
[56:54.03]I hate you.
[56:57.87]I hate you, game.
[57:10.48]Oh my fucking god.
[57:11.32]I'm not leaving.
[57:17.24]The ground is going to be tickets more than ground.
[57:19.36]I don't care.
[57:19.78]How much money do I have?
[57:21.32]I have a dollar left.
[57:22.19]Uh oh.
[57:24.15]How do I call uncle?
[57:25.01]I have to get it right now.
[57:37.11]shit no alright just hold on let me get some more money nobody touched those how do I get more money I have to go to the money machine right
[58:07.44]just making sure tickets tickets no no where's the where's the money machine
[58:37.18]Alright, how do I get more money from, uh, from Dr. Phil?
[58:40.71]Whatever his name is.
[58:56.70]VIP birthday room.
[58:58.02]Okay, I need to go to the VIP birthday room.
[58:59.94]I thought this was the VIP birthday room.
[59:34.28]Watch out.
[59:35.86]Little Jacob has to go into the money machine, guys.
[59:45.71]I'm not even part of the party.
[59:49.01]Is this all I care about?
[59:57.01]Alright.
[59:58.17]I took my shower.
[59:59.10]Is this how, like, billionaires take showers?
[60:02.34]With just wet $1 bills?
[60:21.88]I gotta turn it up.
[60:33.83]New song!
[60:36.25]No, new job!
[60:38.99]Oop, I think I just killed someone.
[60:43.19]What?
[60:46.62]What happened?
[60:58.12]Shining flashlight.
[60:59.12]Alright, what else is over here?
[61:00.78]Is that it?
[61:02.22]Little goodie bags?
[61:04.01]Ooh, cheesy poops.
[61:13.55]Why did I even buy a drink?
[61:14.69]I wanna do a money shower again.
[61:43.82]Is this some other kid's birthday party?
[61:50.10]I think I could do... If these existed, I think I would be really good at it.
[61:58.44]I think I could get almost every single one of these.
[62:02.55]If I had to take a bet, hey, you give me a hundred bucks, and you go in there, and you try to get as much as you can, I think I could make more than like two or three hundred dollars.
[62:14.37]Keep that in mind.
[62:15.13]Keep that in mind.
[62:17.21]Keep that in mind.
[62:17.79]I want one of these.
[62:19.47]I'm going to get one of those.
[62:20.61]Keep that in mind.
[62:24.77]What else is over here?
[62:25.29]Is this like the actual birthday party?
[62:26.61]Are these the adults?
[62:33.27]I don't understand this.
[62:36.65]Islandville Times.
[62:39.05]Carnival.
[62:39.49]Coming to town.
[62:40.75]It is coming to town.
[62:41.43]You're right.
[62:43.17]Piñata?
[62:53.54]What a spoiled little shit.
[62:54.98]It's not even time to do this.
[62:56.38]And I'm just going to break it.
[62:59.56]This is an hour or two from now.
[63:01.32]That gets hung over there.
[63:03.61]But I'm going to break it now.
[63:04.95]Alright, I'm good.
[63:06.43]Let's go.
[63:07.77]I got my money.
[63:08.79]I'm going back to the duck machine.
[63:09.97]Whatever the hell this thing is.
[63:12.11]Move.
[63:17.16]I'm ready.
[63:17.58]Here we go.
[63:23.63]First try.
[63:41.28]I'm sorry, I have to do it.
[63:43.32]Each one of these has to be completed somehow.
[63:46.03]This is the best one to do.
[63:50.77]That's it.
[63:51.65]That's the one.
[63:52.27]It is.
[63:52.89]Oh my god.
[63:58.81]Oops.
[64:04.85]You know what's actually kind of funny?
[64:09.73]I think I have sat there at an arcade, doing this machine, cursing at this thing.
[64:19.20]Doing the same, at least it's for free.
[64:22.84]Because you know, there's like people, there's like families and kids around.
[64:31.95]I don't want to hear that.
[64:32.57]So I just like put my hand up to my mouth and pretend I'm sneezing.
[64:36.62]Or coughing.
[64:38.16]So every time I miss, you know, after playing it like fucking 60 times, you just go like, FOOT!
[64:52.93]Like, you move your head forward like you sneezed.
[64:56.49]Every time.
[64:56.93]It's easy.
[64:58.49]People think you're sneezing or coughing.
[65:10.11]It would look so obvious.
[65:11.57]Yeah, I know.
[65:18.98]If somebody's sat there for that long... Is there a policy in arcades?
[65:22.54]Does anybody know?
[65:25.20]If there's somebody getting... Anybody work in an arcade?
[65:28.26]If there's... If somebody's getting overly frustrated... Is there a protocol where it's like, okay, like, we should probably... What do we do?
[65:43.90]As long as you don't puke, you're fine.
[65:48.42]Alright, I'm only... This can't be the whole stream.
[65:51.48]So, I'm gonna only try this like 30 to 40 more times.
[66:05.54]I got plenty of money.
[66:06.56]It's alright.
[66:12.62]Oh, god damn it.
[66:19.48]This is not going to be the whole stream.
[66:28.97]Try to fill the building with tickets.
[66:33.91]Just don't pick up any tickets.
[66:44.32]Oh god.
[66:46.62]They're not taking anything.
[66:47.52]It's fine.
[66:50.19]I have to accept defeat.
[66:51.13]I'll accept defeat when I go to zero in my bank account.
[67:11.90]I just realized how unhealthy of a thing that was to say.
[67:15.24]No, no, guys.
[67:15.74]I'll stop when I go to zero in my bank account.
[67:19.04]What?
[67:29.84]That's not what you should be saying.
[67:32.39]That's not what you should ever say.
[67:33.65]Somebody just said I'm never going to hit that green light.
[67:45.21]I can come back to it.
[67:45.89]I'll come back to it later.
[67:47.46]After I do this like another 10 more times.
[67:49.56]This is the one right here.
[67:50.26]Come on.
[67:50.48]Ready?
[67:50.62]1, 2, 3.
[67:50.70]It's the one.
[68:08.73]It's not hard enough.
[68:09.43]I'm doing it way too soft.
[68:13.59]Is this the whole- It's not gonna be the whole stream!
[68:24.74]I can't even leave!
[68:26.16]I can't leave.
[68:26.86]It won't let me leave.
[68:35.51]I'm stuck.
[68:38.05]Alright, I'm fine.
[68:41.15]What's this one?
[68:47.75]Mega drop.
[68:49.73]Oh, I remember this one.
[68:50.37]This one's cool.
[68:52.15]Tickets, they'll be fine.
[69:02.44]How many balls do I get?
[69:04.40]Just one?
[69:06.22]Yeah, the Mega Jackpot's almost impossible to get here.
[69:11.62]Say, I know that it's impossible.
[69:12.90]1448.
[69:17.76]Get in there.
[69:23.06]What's that?
[69:23.42]What happened?
[69:24.48]Add bonus ball.
[69:27.06]I did it.
[69:29.00]I can do more.
[69:32.27]Hit drop bonus... Hit drop bonus balls for rapid fire bonus.
[69:37.67]Oh, you gotta get it in... That thing has a ring around it, though, so it's impossible.
[69:45.39]What was that?
[69:47.65]Mystery bonus?
[69:50.66]That's not bad.
[69:53.72]That's 212 tickets.
[69:54.80]How come they're not coming out?
[69:58.14]Let's just go straight in.
[70:04.37]250 tickets, there we go.
[70:09.05]Do you want me to do it again?
[70:11.85]I'll do it one more time.
[70:18.94]Oh, almost in there.
[70:20.32]40 tickets.
[70:22.80]I used to time the ball falling straight into the highest prize when it takes time, but I perfected it as a kid.
[70:34.43]Yeah, you can just time it just to go straight in, huh?
[70:37.35]Give me the mystery bonus.
[70:40.30]What is this like roulette wheel bullshit?
[70:41.78]This is just roulette wheel for kids.
[70:53.13]Get in there.
[70:54.61]Give me the 50.
[70:58.33]He's still checking to make sure the tickets are on the ground.
[71:03.60]Kind of.
[71:05.70]I want to make sure that I can... I want to fill the whole house.
[71:12.27]The Dave and Buster's near you.
[71:14.01]Put an out of order sign on this machine because it was too easy to get constant jackpots.
[71:21.46]Out of order.
[71:22.18]I thought they want people to win?
[71:23.98]One more time.
[71:34.42]It was right there.
[71:35.98]Get in there.
[71:37.14]Get in the mystery bonus.
[71:44.53]I can't wait to play skee-ball.
[71:55.54]It was right there.
[71:56.28]I'm going to just try to get that once.
[71:57.76]I'm going to try timing.
[71:59.88]We have a new noise to make.
[72:04.62]Oh!
[72:05.50]I did it!
[72:05.94]I actually did it!
[72:07.44]I actually did it!
[72:09.50]I did it!
[72:11.64]Bonus ball!
[72:14.10]Oh, there's gonna be more bonuses!
[72:18.98]What?
[72:20.38]Bonus ball!
[72:21.98]I thought that was like super bonus... Drop bonus ball.
[72:24.13]I thought I just... I thought it doesn't drop?
[72:34.45]I thought it drops like a bunch of them like rapid bonus drop.
[72:47.38]I needed to mash the button.
[72:48.52]I was clicking it didn't do anything.
[72:56.38]Imagine getting the bonus first try and not hitting the button to get the bonus.
[73:02.03]I thought I was.
[73:14.35]It just disappeared.
[73:27.38]I did it again?
[73:31.28]Wait, what?
[73:31.88]What happened to that one?
[73:35.27]No, I gotta hear the Yoshi sound one more time.
[73:36.97]There it is.
[73:40.21]I love it.
[73:40.59]I love the Yoshi sound.
[73:41.41]I have to hear it a few more times.
[73:45.66]Got it.
[73:45.88]The tickets are not gone.
[73:52.01]Tickets are still here.
[73:52.85]Fine.
[73:54.69]My brother could kick your ass at this game.
[73:56.59]Tell him to bring it on.
[74:01.45]Well, that was like three or four consistent bonus balls in a row.
[74:04.05]Damn it.
[74:05.84]Alright, I'm going to try to get the jackpot.
[74:07.40]I'm going to try to go for it.
[74:08.40]I'm going to try to time it.
[74:16.44]It's, like, right here.
[74:17.74]Ready?
[74:21.04]Oh, that was close.
[74:24.10]It's that, like, stupid toilet bowl lid that fucks you up.
[74:33.41]One more time.
[74:38.63]Shit.
[74:40.85]Get in there.
[74:42.65]Rapid bonus?
[74:43.35]Mega bonus?
[74:45.26]Oh, no.
[74:50.57]The tickets are not gone.
[74:51.53]The tickets are still there.
[74:52.41]I can see them.
[74:55.80]Shit.
[74:57.52]Get in there anyways!
[75:07.48]Here we go.
[75:12.45]Ready?
[75:15.15]Try it last time.
[75:24.71]Get in!
[75:25.13]The tickets didn't despawn.
[75:32.83]I have an eagle eye on them.
[75:36.54]Mega jackpot, get in there.
[75:44.18]Oh!
[75:45.66]1448 tickets!
[75:46.36]I just, ah!
[75:58.45]And that's the way he went.
[76:03.94]What?
[76:04.24]That's not what it looks like.
[76:05.50]Are you serious?
[76:09.62]Why is this such a tiny pile?
[76:17.03]Just making sure.
[76:35.01]Come on!
[76:37.96]Come on!
[76:40.64]Come on!
[76:43.54]Let's go.
[76:45.33]This is the one.
[76:45.93]Come on!
[76:49.71]I got- I got my muscle memories wrong.
[77:15.44]What happens if it goes in the toilet?
[77:21.92]There's no skill to this.
[77:24.20]What do you mean no skill to this?
[77:25.92]How have I not hit it?
[77:28.36]It's forward momentum and spring-loaded action.
[77:41.73]Don't make me get one of these.
[77:44.43]For the carnival stream.
[77:46.01]And have you guys prove me wrong.
[77:48.74]Don't make me rent one of these.
[77:50.34]Come on!
[78:00.62]Get it!
[78:13.89]Can I do it?
[78:27.76]Oh my god.
[78:28.76]Damn it.
[78:29.22]Alright, I'm out.
[78:29.72]I'm out.
[78:30.62]I'm out.
[78:39.59]I'm out, I'm out.
[78:40.35]After this last one here.
[78:41.62]This is the last one, and then I'm out.
[78:43.22]Until I come back.
[78:43.90]Fucking god.
[78:55.32]I have to do this at least once.
[78:57.30]My brain is wired so fucked up.
[79:00.56]You know what I'm saying?
[79:01.12]Like, I have such a fucked up wiring of my brain.
[79:03.99]I have to do this.
[79:05.27]Even if the stream is off.
[79:07.15]This stream could not be online.
[79:09.90]and I will sit here until I do it and now I'm just not even close Kim will come in here and ask me to open another jar my hand will be too weak from clicking this mouse
[79:39.07]This is it.
[79:39.41]This is the one.
[79:39.95]Right here.
[79:40.19]Oh my god.
[79:41.94]Damn it.
[79:57.03]What a loser is what he just said.
[79:59.33]What a loser.
[80:07.59]Oh my god.
[80:20.92]I have to windproof that person wrong.
[80:41.69]You can do this with cheering you want.
[80:42.91]Thanks, guys.
[80:43.65]I need more cheering.
[80:46.25]This is getting really high.
[80:47.87]I'm gonna be able to make a ticket snowman.
[81:00.26]This is gonna hurt somebody.
[81:02.34]That's a hazard.
[81:10.67]I'm only gonna try to get this one spot here.
[81:12.11]Ready?
[81:13.87]I'm gonna have to count here.
[81:14.65]Ready?
[81:15.41]It's this spot right here.
[81:16.35]One.
[81:18.25]Two.
[81:20.31]Nope.
[81:20.73]It's less than two seconds.
[81:26.52]Yes, I'd like to play again.
[81:27.28]One.
[81:33.99]It's a little more than one second.
[81:35.09]Less than two seconds, more than one... That doesn't make any mathematical sense!
[81:38.47]It's more than one second, less than two seconds, so it's like 1.72?
[81:40.71]One.
[81:40.95]It's 1.82.
[82:07.23]It's fucking hard.
[82:37.77]I'm turning into an ape.
[82:43.29]That was so fucking loud.
[82:44.64]I'm so sorry.
[82:47.18]I'm so sorry everybody that was fucking loud.
[82:52.90]That was rigged.
[82:53.50]It is.
[82:53.94]I did it.
[82:54.82]Oh my god.
[83:02.45]It wanted to do it too.
[83:07.33]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[83:08.05]I got it.
[83:08.51]It's gonna happen.
[83:10.45]Here it is.

[84:32.21]Because that's what's happening right now.
[84:35.46]That's what has happened.
[84:37.08]It has been an hour and 25 minutes.
[84:38.80]You don't need to imagine or pretend.
[84:45.62]Okay, this is the one right here.
[84:47.44]They're not giving it to me anymore because my cursor's on it.
[84:49.80]The game developer put in a feature.
[85:00.07]Alright, I'm serious.
[85:01.05]This is like the last three or four times I'm gonna try this.
[85:08.50]Okay, I gotta get like three or four more attempts with the green being there.
[85:14.75]Which one is it?
[85:15.21]This one?
[85:15.89]It's this one right here.
[85:23.54]Oh shit!
[85:26.82]You fucking psycho.
[85:29.26]Go cash your tickets in.
[85:36.31]That's it.

[86:36.09]God damn it.
[86:40.99]Don't let the chicken win.
[86:45.63]Okay, at this point, people have their phones out.
[86:48.13]And this is like, watch this guy at the arcade being insane.
[86:53.10]There's like people, there's like ten cell phones behind me.
[86:57.84]Oh my god, I'm gonna freak out.
[87:07.56]One.
[87:08.62]Two.
[87:10.83]Oh my god, what do I do?
[87:12.49]How do I get out of this?
[87:14.69]I have to rip the Ethernet cable out of my computer, I think.
[87:16.39]I have to rip the power out.
[87:18.82]Alright, one more try there and that's it.
[87:30.02]And then I'm moving on to the next machine.
[87:34.60]That has to be right there, though.
[87:47.04]Please do this forever.
[87:48.02]No, don't enable me.
[87:52.01]Get out of here.
[87:53.63]This is my ticket.
[87:56.47]Alright.
[88:01.12]Oh, fuck.
[88:02.84]One more.
[88:03.12]No, that's it.
[88:03.64]I gotta get out of here.
[88:04.44]I have to leave.
[88:05.36]That's it.
[88:06.06]I can't do it.
[88:14.57]I can't do it.
[88:15.01]I'm out.
[88:15.32]I gotta leave.
[88:15.68]I can't do it.
[88:17.02]Just rip it out.
[88:35.05]I can't.
[88:35.39]I can't do it.
[88:38.19]There's no reason to try.
[88:39.23]I can't do it.
[88:43.78]I can't move.
[89:00.52]You know, this looks like somebody, it looks like he was squashed this, and all of its guts came out.
[89:11.11]What's this one?
[89:12.73]I love this one.
[89:21.68]No, in order, in order, in order.

[90:34.45]Oops.
[90:52.24]Ooh.

[91:35.90]Swish it.
[91:36.36]I gotta get a swish.

[91:44.28]Oh.
[91:53.01]Use the tickets?
[91:53.77]I will, I will.
[91:54.49]I'm just making sure that nobody else can touch that machine.
[91:57.80]I have it reserved.
[91:58.54]100.
[92:01.30]Ugh.
[92:01.52]They're not going to despawn.
[92:04.18]I got a good eye on them.
[92:07.42]Oh, shower, please!
[92:13.31]Okay, let's get them.
[92:14.63]You ready for this?
[92:15.79]You ready to pick up our baklava?
[92:17.11]This is going to be so satisfying.
[92:51.26]Mark, what do you mean stop?
[92:53.88]Stop, stop, what do you mean?
[92:54.98]Stop, why?
[92:56.73]What are you talking about?
[93:22.08]Okay, that's it.
[93:24.24]Just wanted to see if I had... If lightning can strike twice, I'm done.
[93:28.41]Alright, let's go count them.
[93:32.97]I wonder how much tickets I have.
[93:35.09]How many tickets do I have?
[93:36.37]10,000.
[93:36.39]8... What do I got?
[93:41.56]80... 80, uh... 8,800?
[93:51.36]Alright, what's next?
[93:52.42]Ski ball.
[93:52.84]I want to get the... I want to get better ski ball.
[93:57.00]Let's do the one on the right.
[94:02.44]8600, 800, 8600, 41.
[94:03.22]How many points do I need to get on ski ball before I move on?
[94:10.61]I'll determine that in a minute.
[94:13.03]I gotta find the 100 and just keep it in the same place.
[94:16.60]That's the strategy.
[94:17.41]Just don't move the fucking mouse.
[94:19.53]So I'm going to... Let's see.
[94:20.55]Let's see.
[94:22.09]Right here, maybe?
[94:22.87]Like right there?
[94:24.91]And then we're going to go halfway up.
[94:26.78]No, not even close.
[94:36.15]No, a little bit less than that.
[94:47.32]I need to get 800 points to leave skeeball.
[94:49.68]That's never going to happen.
[95:01.23]Why do I keep moving?
[95:01.99]I'm not moving.
[95:02.97]It's doing that automatically.
[95:03.91]It picks up the ball.
[95:07.19]Yeah, just climb up on the machine and put it in the 100.
[95:09.25]And then get yelled at and get told, don't do that again.
[95:14.27]Oh, okay.
[95:15.97]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[95:23.08]Yeah, just walk over there, reach up and drop all the balls in there.
[95:27.98]And then get yelled at.
[95:29.21]And have your mother get called.
[95:33.65]Oh my god, I have to get 100 points.
[95:35.39]What a pathetic score.
[95:37.11]90?
[95:38.97]I can't, come on, I can't even get my IQ in this game.
[95:42.20]Let's go.
[95:43.74]I gotta get at least my IQ.
[96:04.29]You can't get zero points.
[96:05.59]See, that... You are on top.
[96:07.39]You got that one.
[96:08.27]You're on top of that.
[96:10.35]Why is it so hard to get 100?
[96:17.06]There it is.
[96:24.54]Alright.
[96:24.98]Right there.
[96:25.34]I know where it is.
[96:26.90]Just don't move from this spot.
[96:27.80]Ready?
[96:32.24]Shit.
[96:34.96]Alright, I'm almost at my IQ.
[96:38.44]So, I passed it.
[96:40.32]By just a little bit.
[96:44.10]Alright, I got to 100.
[96:50.76]That's all I care about.
[96:51.42]Is there one more?
[96:56.04]Alright, 180.
[96:58.98]No, I'm done.
[96:59.50]Alright, let's go get these up.
[97:00.72]180 tickets.
[97:04.47]Alright, so... That leaves us with ones in the middle.
[97:07.90]And then there's... I think there's another floor.
[97:13.88]Yeah, I know.
[97:14.44]There's like another floor.
[97:19.42]But I remember this one.
[97:20.10]You have to speed drop this.
[97:21.29]Alright, let's try it.
[97:22.23]You gotta try to get all 50, right?
[97:24.79]Press the button to drop balls into the buckets.
[97:26.15]You gotta try to go like... Yeah, you have to like spam it and get it in.
[97:31.53]So like this.
[97:43.72]You gotta try to get five in each one, if I remember.

[109:09.42]Hi, guys.
[109:16.61]Well, that was weird.
[109:18.89]Strangely enough, the internet just cut to zero.
[109:22.51]To zero.
[109:24.55]I don't know what happened.
[109:25.25]I don't know why.
[109:25.87]It was pretty perfect the whole time.
[109:30.53]So, that's really fucking irritating.
[109:32.51]But, hey, we're back.
[109:33.35]Welcome, everybody.
[109:33.95]How you doing?
[109:38.98]Let's see if it happens again.

[109:44.83]Who knows?
[109:47.41]So, uh... Sorry about that.
[109:49.89]Let's try this again.

[110:36.72]I'm going to redo it again.
[110:37.74]Alright, here we go.
[110:48.13]Retweeting your own tweet.
[110:50.82]And then quoting that tweet in another retweet.
[110:59.18]Now let's do this.
[111:03.29]Damn it.
[111:04.53]We were in the groove too.
[111:05.67]That's so unfortunate.
[111:06.93]Alright, don't let it bother you.
[111:08.77]Don't let it just... Didn't happen.
[111:13.90]Didn't happen.

[115:41.54]So how do I get to the next area?
[115:43.76]With games.
[115:45.54]I know there's more games.
[115:48.34]Go to my golf cart?
[115:53.10]Jerry's the pier.
[115:54.98]The beach.
[115:57.81]Is it the pier?
[116:06.17]Oh, man.
[116:08.62]There's like rides too?
[116:10.12]Are you serious?
[116:11.64]How much does it cost?
[116:15.66]Your wallet balance.
[116:16.56]So I can do eight pack ride pass.
[116:18.88]Just get the mega pass.
[116:20.22]Wait.
[116:21.04]I can only afford this.
[116:21.82]Okay.
[116:23.41]There's the eight pack for the rides.
[116:26.03]Okay.
[116:27.61]Eight ride pass.
[116:31.95]Should I bring more money in here?
[116:38.16]I gotta get more money from the uncle.
[116:42.34]Hold on.
[116:42.64]Yeah.
[116:42.88]Back to... Hold on.
[116:45.06]Back to Larry's.
[116:49.39]I need to go back in my money shower.
[116:57.21]Go rob your uncle.
[117:02.45]No, my uncle just stashes $1 bills in here for me to take whenever I want.
[117:08.05]And give me some of this, too.
[117:12.96]Just do the money shower for 10 minutes.
[117:15.42]I'll get $200.
[117:15.70]We'll do this until I get $200.
[117:17.23]And then we can go do the rest of it.
[117:27.86]Just stay in one spot.
[117:28.66]You want to know the trick for this thing?
[117:30.18]People freak out and they try to grab all over the place.
[117:32.47]No.
[117:33.15]Just keep your hand here and just grab.
[117:35.61]Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab.
[117:36.59]Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab.
[117:38.71]You'll get as many.
[117:39.47]You don't have to freak out.
[117:40.15]People freak out in here.
[117:46.02]And make sure you put them in your pockets or in your underwear.
[117:51.92]You know, people are like, oh, my hands are so full, I don't have any more room in my hands.
[117:55.09]Just stuff them down your pants.
[117:56.41]Like, stuff into your underwear.
[117:57.77]Keep grabbing.
[118:07.42]Okay, that was weird.
[118:18.97]Because it's hard to do your pockets.
[118:21.25]You might be panicking and it's hard to get your hand in your pockets if you're stuffing bills in there.
[118:26.01]But your underwear is just a gigantic elastic pocket.
[118:34.60]I would just be grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff.
[118:38.71]I would take them all.
[118:44.63]Once you have ten bills in your pocket, it's gonna be hard to put anything else in there.
[118:49.34]One more time.
[119:01.55]Just tuck your shirt in your pants and then your shirt isn't bagged.
[119:08.45]Yeah!
[119:09.55]And then just start feeding it down.
[119:12.33]First put rubber bands around the bottom of your pant legs.
[119:16.14]And then just become an inflated guy.
[119:23.04]Alright, I got 200 bucks.
[119:25.49]199, that's fine.
[119:25.83]I'll take it.
[119:43.51]That was a very clear, get out of my way.
[119:46.27]Alright.
[119:47.44]Let's go to... Where do I want to go here?
[119:55.13]Is there a... How did I get to that before?
[119:57.11]I have to be outside.
[120:05.12]I was just thinking about doing the chicken game again, and I freaked out and stopped.
[120:08.63]Alright.
[120:10.69]Let's go to... Let's go to Barry's.
[120:13.97]Let me sell my stuff.
[120:24.23]You know I had to try, right?
[120:32.16]Barry's.
[120:32.78]Alright.
[120:36.65]Please use the other door.
[120:39.25]No.
[120:39.77]I'm using this one.
[120:41.44]Pawn and swap.
[120:42.88]Barry, we buy anything.
[120:47.46]What's my hand?
[120:48.62]Oh, my card.
[120:49.48]Cheesy poops.
[120:50.18]I thought they were poops.
[120:53.27]Okay.
[120:55.09]My uncle gives me these for free.
[120:56.29]Why would I buy them?
[121:05.02]No, that's enough of that.
[121:06.34]Uh, what's this?
[121:10.08]Nothing.
[121:11.76]Okay, so, uh, let's go here.
[121:13.62]We have to put in the headphones.
[121:24.79]How much are the headphones worth?
[121:29.13]I thought that said $4,500. $4,500.
[121:40.72]Alright, what about the salt rock thing?
[121:45.12]I don't think I want this.
[121:54.37]Yeah, I don't want, like, the zip.
[121:56.25]Yeah, I did say it was cool.
[122:02.66]But that's... whatever.
[122:05.60]I'm keeping the glow stick.
[122:11.22]Alright, let's go to the pier.
[122:15.11]I'm ready.
[122:16.91]I got my pass.
[122:18.29]Let me get, I need to, let me get another pass.
[122:20.67]The super pass.
[122:22.63]Now I have, I have like 40 rides.
[122:25.39]I have like 30 something rides.
[122:28.19]Alright.
[122:29.55]Let's dart over here.
[122:30.61]20 coins for $5.
[122:37.32]That's one of these machines.
[122:39.12]I hate these things.
[122:52.92]Hold on.
[122:53.16]I'll get it.
[122:53.40]I'll get it.
[122:53.76]I'll get it.
[122:57.97]Shit.
[122:58.29]I hate these ones.
[122:59.09]Because it's travel time.
[123:09.44]What do those chips do?
[123:15.20]Can I hit the machine?
[123:16.24]I probably can, but it's gonna get me in trouble.
[123:17.66]I gotta wait.
[123:18.08]I gotta time it.
[123:18.54]I'm gonna do it this way.
[123:20.94]No.
[123:22.04]Dammit.
[123:23.98]Hit it.
[123:24.23]I'm not gonna hit the machine!
[123:25.21]That's again- That's illegal!
[123:26.27]That's against the law!
[123:35.33]No, I'm not gonna do something against the law.
[123:38.57]We're gonna win this the right way.
[123:43.15]This isn't even working.
[123:48.00]This doesn't even do anything!
[123:52.68]I'm trying to get it like... What am I doing?
[123:56.36]Why am I trying to do it like that?
[124:00.54]I don't know why I'm trying to get it to land on top of that.
[124:02.91]It makes no sense.
[124:07.15]Pick a prize.
[124:09.41]Hammer.
[124:10.95]Four prize credits?
[124:12.03]I don't have any prize credits.
[124:15.54]Alright, let's do this again.
[124:16.44]I can do this.
[124:17.30]What's over there?
[124:19.10]Look at how empty that one is.
[124:20.08]Alright, we gotta go now.
[124:27.95]Ooh.
[124:29.09]Dropping more prize tokens.
[124:36.53]Why is this not moving?
[124:41.10]Are these just glued on here under the coins, dropping down a hole?
[124:51.74]Wait.
[124:52.72]Why... Why can I... Why would I be allowed to do this?
[125:03.27]This seems like cheating.
[125:15.30]Tokens have no real value.
[125:16.38]These machines are not regulated in any way and are most likely a scam.
[125:21.49]I'm just gonna put all the coins up at the same time and try to just knock something up He loses even when he's cheating Watch this.
[125:34.62]I'm gonna strategically place these coins in the corner here and there's gonna be a big push I wish they would not stack on top of each other
[125:49.05]Why are they doing this?
[125:50.39]Why are you doing this?
[125:51.73]Stop doing that?
[125:53.53]Why?
[125:54.31]That doesn't make any... Alright, I've got magnets.
[126:00.27]They're magnetized.
[126:01.25]I get it now.
[126:08.28]Do it.
[126:14.98]What?
[126:21.51]That doesn't make any sense.
[126:23.35]I don't believe that for a second.
[126:31.17]Those prize coins don't do anything.
[126:32.59]They don't move.
[126:32.91]Let me do this one more time.
[126:47.55]You can't even get them.
[126:51.57]Well, I can get the three down here.
[126:52.61]Alright, these ones are actually not glued.
[126:59.98]The right side is the one to do.
[127:01.90]Look at how stuffed that is too.
[127:15.76]This is depressing.
[127:17.16]This is not real money.
[127:19.99]This is not even real.
[127:21.33]Yeah, we got floating coins over here.
[127:31.94]It's bullshit.
[127:33.22]Alright, I'm gonna at least get the hammer.
[127:41.80]Let's see what I do here.
[127:44.83]Ready?
[127:45.03]Watch this.
[127:48.46]Uh... That wasn't kind of... That was not... That was unfair.
[127:51.05]Alright, push it forward.
[127:53.33]Watch this.
[127:53.75]This three's gonna come out here.
[127:57.61]That felt really good.
[128:08.06]Only four at a time.
[128:08.70]That's all you need to do.
[128:09.32]Alright, I got three game points.
[128:16.88]How many do I need?
[128:18.29]Five?
[128:25.22]I think that's all I need.
[128:27.68]I might as well get the lighter.
[128:30.00]How many more points?
[128:30.66]How many more points?
[128:40.40]They're alright.
[128:41.28]They're alright here.
[128:43.45]I gotta try.
[128:56.29]Alright, alright.

[129:10.74]What?
[129:11.02]Where'd it go?
[129:11.78]Where is it?
[129:20.05]Where's my prize?
[129:23.69]Where's the prize?
[129:24.25]Did I just get scammed?
[129:39.26]Oh.
[129:39.40]Did you just, like, threw it over here?
[129:43.19]I didn't even know it went over here.
[129:45.40]Alright, I did it.
[129:45.92]I won.
[129:47.30]This one's out of order, out of order.
[129:48.82]No, we beat that one.
[129:51.36]I got the fish.
[129:51.94]That's all I care about.
[129:57.14]What's this?
[130:00.55]Island time customer service.
[130:01.89]Out of order.
[130:02.39]Oh well.
[130:06.19]I'm doing... I'm doing the thing that your dog does when they go in the backyard.
[130:12.88]Just run around the perimeter like three times and then come back in the house.
[130:18.78]I need to check the perimeter.
[130:23.61]Beer tent.
[130:28.59]I got like a flashlight.
[130:29.97]Am I allowed in here?
[130:32.03]Oh, come on.
[130:34.93]Am I not 21?
[130:38.01]Coins on the ground?
[130:39.39]Some kid will be happy that he finds that.
[130:41.67]Bumper cars.
[130:44.78]Ferris wheel?
[130:49.36]Hold on.
[130:51.04]Alright, let's do the ferris wheel.
[130:54.80]Holy, why am I running so fast?
[131:07.57]I made it.
[131:08.11]Okay, so is this a stranger?
[131:09.57]Hi.
[131:14.62]I'm just gonna say, the Ferris Wheel is probably the worst ride that's ever been invented.
[131:21.72]You just sit.
[131:26.32]You don't do anything else.
[131:30.65]I mean, yeah, that's cool.
[131:32.25]Nice.
[131:32.59]But you can just look out the window for an airplane.
[131:35.01]And like... Y'all, look, I can see the ocean and the other stuff there.
[131:40.38]This shit's like 40 bucks to do this.
[131:47.16]Can I stand up?
[131:57.13]It just skips it.
[131:58.03]God damn it.
[131:59.61]Well, that was fucking like $7.
[132:01.37]Oh, well.
[132:06.64]Just get on the airplane that everybody has.
[132:08.52]Yeah, just get on your airplane.
[132:11.52]Okay.
[132:12.58]So, what's over here?
[132:15.29]Look at all these.
[132:15.79]There's a bunch of other games over there.
[132:16.97]Alright, hold on.
[132:18.61]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[132:19.27]I don't think it's supposed to be on... Somebody get their kid!
[132:28.50]Shut it down.
[132:28.96]We've got a kid.
[132:36.26]How do I... I want to do this.
[132:43.25]Sorry, I'm just looking for my kid.
[132:46.89]Jerry!
[132:48.09]Jerry!
[132:56.01]Oh, here we go.
[133:00.37]I would like to play, please.
[133:02.15]Alright, bumper cars.
[133:20.21]Can you peel out?
[133:28.78]This is so dumb.
[133:31.48]Is there anything else I can do?
[133:35.00]While I'm in here?
[133:35.97]Or... No, I'm gonna try to get... I'm gonna go from corner to corner.
[133:43.61]I'm gonna try to pick up some speed and just ram into somebody.
[133:46.29]This is what I used to do.
[133:48.09]You guys ever want to have a secret tip for how to do bumper cars right?
[133:51.80]Drive around in a circle, because everyone gets stuck in the middle.
[133:55.58]Build up enough momentum.
[133:57.98]Going around in a circle and then... BANG!
[134:00.14]You just smash into somebody.
[134:02.50]Otherwise you just do this.
[134:03.32]For five straight minutes.
[134:08.89]Everybody sticks in the middle.
[134:15.16]What the fuck is this rat right here?
[134:24.37]Well, there's usually not that many people.
[134:34.63]Everybody alright?
[134:41.88]Alright, well, bye.
[134:46.56]Lemonade?
[134:47.10]Oh, they have the Tower of Terror.
[134:49.58]Okay, hold on.
[134:51.40]Uh, which way do I go?
[134:52.74]Over here.
[134:59.96]Wait, wait, wait, no, wait for me, wait for me!
[135:04.78]Come on, I'm gonna get on for free!
[135:10.64]This is the quickest way to get, like, your head, like, your neck broken.
[135:15.88]Wait for me!
[135:16.30]Wait for me!
[135:22.37]I'll get on it.
[135:32.67]Oh, it's a security guard.
[135:39.08]How am I gonna get on this?
[135:42.00]Oh, I think it resets it.
[135:43.24]Yeah, alright.
[135:50.60]Here we go.
[135:54.96]I do not like riding these.
[135:57.36]I don't want to be on this.
[135:59.00]Because people puke on these all the time.
[136:03.76]And if guy in sombrero ahead of you here pukes, this is going to hit you... This is going to cover your whole body.
[136:14.37]It's going to spray you across your entire body, head to toe.
[136:20.03]Don't ride these.
[136:29.36]If you're going to puke on one of these, lean down and try to puke this way.
[136:34.68]But it might get just caught up and swing up in the wind and hit somebody.
[136:37.61]I hate this.
[136:44.41]I'm getting off.
[136:47.12]Or just lift your shirt up.
[136:48.92]Guys, if you're gonna throw up on a ride, don't be the day- like, you're throwing up, right?
[136:54.97]So try to do- your day's gonna be fucked up after that anyways.
[136:58.91]Grab your shirt, lift it up, tilt it so it makes a big cup, and just puke into your shirt down.
[137:09.62]Don't ruin somebody else's vacation.
[137:14.63]Just, yeah, just puke into your underwear.
[137:17.30]That ride sucks.
[137:20.76]Who wants to ride that?
[137:21.60]Let's keep going.
[137:29.33]I'll do this one.
[137:31.39]Didn't they change?
[137:32.01]Isn't this now the Guardians of the Galaxy ride now?
[137:40.14]Imagine seeing somebody go, oh no.
[137:43.42]They're like pulling their pants and just puking down into their fucking underwear.
[137:50.64]That would be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[137:53.89]I would never get over it.
[137:57.69]Ever.
[138:00.51]That would be the only thing I could think of for the rest of my life.
[138:14.61]Okay, I'm thinking right now as if I've seen this.
[138:18.53]I've never seen this, but I'm laughing because of it.
[138:26.49]This didn't happen.
[138:29.54]People puke on this thing all the time too.
[138:32.40]That's why the vents are here.
[138:41.88]Can I stand on it?
[138:49.10]No, I can't, like, stand in it.
[138:50.34]I can't... I don't think I can get... I'm not sure I can get a free ride here, guys.
[138:57.51]Maybe I can.
[139:01.49]Let's see what happens.
[139:04.16]Nope.
[139:04.48]Alright, another game coming up.
[139:09.02]Wait.
[139:09.18]Wait.
[139:17.98]Here's another ride that you should never ride.
[139:20.79]Because all this ride does is make you feel like you're peeing into your stomach.
[139:27.83]It doesn't do anything else.
[139:40.13]No, no.
[139:40.83]I'm done.
[139:42.17]I can't.
[139:42.55]I hate this thing.
[139:45.24]You can put me on a roller coaster that goes 5,000 miles per hour.
[139:49.15]I'll ride it every time.
[139:53.29]Sorry, I don't want to ride the thing that specifically just makes you feel like shit.
[139:56.81]That's all these rides do.
[139:59.54]There's no other purpose for these rides.
[140:03.74]They don't do anything.
[140:05.32]The only thing they're here for is to cause you stomach discomfort.
[140:09.55]And for one thing, I...
[140:13.00]I tried to do the... But I couldn't get the... Out.
[140:18.69]I couldn't get it out.
[140:20.09]I tried.
[140:20.53]Somebody's just standing there.
[140:27.73]You never should ride these rides.
[140:29.15]And I'll tell you another thing.
[140:30.37]And the thing just hits him right in the face.
[140:33.35]That's not funny.
[140:35.06]Alright.
[140:36.68]There's a couple of games, right?
[140:39.84]Here we go.
[140:45.00]One race is fo- Ooh, this is the- you spray the- I can do this really well.
[140:49.20]You're gonna spray the circle?
[140:50.18]Oh, it's the little dachshunds!
[141:06.89]It's the little odd-headed!
[141:11.00]Is that me up there?
[141:19.13]why am I going so slow alright let me tell you something number four clearly did not hit the circle one time look at number four watch number four no do it again let's go I'm gonna put my dpi down for this way down
[142:04.14]Did I do it?
[142:06.22]Three?
[142:06.68]What?
[142:09.45]Alright, I'm going to put the DPI down even more.
[142:21.91]Try this one more time.
[142:44.97]No, my sensitivity is too high.
[142:54.79]How do I turn my sensitivity down?
[142:59.77]With my mouse.
[143:04.62]Hello?
[143:11.71]Oh my god, the DPI is so high, I cannot even use my mouse on my desktop.
[143:21.01]Did I break it?
[143:25.72]I think I broke it.
[143:31.46]Yeah, I can't get out of here.
[143:42.45]Shit.
[143:43.67]No, I have to win.
[143:50.90]No, I'm doing the DPI.
[143:52.60]I think I just broke it.
[143:56.64]I mean, I can alt-tab, but I'm going to have to... Alright, let's go back in.
[144:13.45]I can beat that.
[144:14.01]I just need to turn my mouse sensitivity way down.
[144:20.31]Because there's no mouse settings in the game.
[144:21.65]So let me turn my mouse, like, pointer speed down to, like, a tiny, tiny, tiny amount.
[144:30.76]Pointer speed.
[144:31.48]Let's go, like, down here.
[144:33.52]That looks good.
[144:35.92]I think I just crashed my whole computer by changing my mouse speed.
[144:44.06]How the fuck does that make any sense?
[144:45.40]Alright, we're good.
[144:46.74]Alright, here we go.
[145:05.74]Survival?
[145:06.50]I can't do survival.
[145:07.62]It's not ready yet.
[145:12.00]There's fireworks in this game?
[145:31.32]Alright, let me get some money.
[145:34.20]I don't care about any of that.
[145:35.19]Just give me money.
[145:39.91]Why is it so loud now?
[145:51.59]This is so much louder than it was.
[145:56.99]Why can I not change the audio now?
[146:04.86]Load game?
[146:06.16]Well, here's the thing.
[146:07.16]I never saved it.
[146:08.58]Because you can't save inside.
[146:10.36]Alright, I got plenty of money.
[146:15.66]Let's go.
[146:17.71]One more time.
[146:32.64]Generate.
[146:38.20]I don't think I even need to click.
[146:39.82]Alright, back to the carnival.
[146:59.95]Let's do the crane game.
[147:00.97]No, no, no.
[147:02.53]Everyone's saying that, oh no, I didn't save.
[147:04.03]That's alright.
[147:05.59]Because I can do the bucket machine.
[147:07.76]Or the hockey machine.
[147:08.90]And get 2,500 tickets.
[147:10.84]Guaranteed.
[147:11.32]Every time.
[147:13.96]Everything's gonna be fine.
[147:22.71]Alright.
[147:26.27]Back to the carnival.
[147:33.53]Hello sir, I'd like to buy 8 ride passes, because the rides... I don't want to ride rides, I want to play games, and there's like 10 that I haven't played yet, so let's keep going.
[147:45.83]Back to the water spray.
[147:51.40]Is lemonade a game, or no?
[147:52.78]Is it just a lemonade?
[147:54.36]I think it's just a lemonade.
[147:55.90]$4.50!
[147:57.52]Are you out of your mind?
[148:02.02]What did he say?
[148:04.76]Where's my lemonade?
[148:06.98]Oh.
[148:13.20]Now the volume's too low now.
[148:18.52]Why?
[148:25.54]I think I broke something.
[148:30.18]Wasn't there a straw?
[148:32.70]Alright, I weirdly drank that out of the cup.
[148:35.78]Alright, here we go.
[148:37.36]DPI is better.
[148:39.29]Time to win.
[148:39.73]I have to win every single game.
[148:43.31]Or riot.
[149:10.05]The DPI, I didn't do anything.
[149:14.66]I lowered the mouse DPI.
[149:16.44]I lowered the mouse pointer speed.
[149:17.76]It doesn't matter.
[149:18.24]I have to do it without it.
[149:23.57]Let's go.
[149:58.44]to relax I got it I'm gonna have to do this to my feet in a minute I think I'm gonna lose with my feet I'm not kidding start over here
[150:31.46]It's still, I can't!
[150:44.99]I can.
[150:46.01]I'm trying to find, where's like the sweets back?
[150:57.74]Why is he freezing up?
[151:05.62]See what I'm saying?
[151:06.02]Like, why does it keep freezing?
[151:18.39]Take 3's spot.
[151:33.51]I don't think I can do this.
[151:34.43]There's nobody at three.
[151:35.50]I was trying to... I have to be at five.
[151:40.46]I'm gonna try to aim a little bit more down.
[152:07.05]I did it?
[152:07.77]I did it?
[152:10.55]I just did it.

[152:37.67]What's it called?
[152:38.23]Lucky duck.
[152:39.84]I don't have to jump to see this.
[152:42.70]One duck for two bucks.
[152:47.66]I don't understand.
[152:48.80]What does that mean?
[152:53.44]Oh, you just pick the ducks.
[152:59.36]And one of them is correct.
[153:01.98]It's this stupid thing.
[153:19.71]You can't win this one.
[153:20.59]There's no way to win this.
[153:22.40]What are you, three?
[153:37.32]Plus three credits I think is winning.

[154:30.09]Alright, well here's this one.
[154:32.49]This one's really hard.
[154:33.87]Five balls for five dollars, you got it.
[154:42.19]Yellow is three, blue is two.
[154:46.74]How do I throw it harder than that?
[154:50.78]This is pathetic.
[155:06.39]Ooh, I... Ding ding ding!
[155:11.73]I can get it in the middle.
[155:12.89]I can get it in the middle.
[155:15.82]Let's do it again.
[155:16.46]Right in the middle.

[155:43.77]Yes, I did it!
[155:46.62]Why was that only two?
[155:57.27]That was on a blue?

[158:48.77]You turn your volume down.
[159:07.52]Oh, it's alright, it's alright.

[159:27.55]This is the dart game?
[159:30.67]Oh, there's that ball roller.
[159:32.22]There's so many games.
[159:33.06]I can't wait.
[159:34.24]Alright, let's go.
[159:42.22]What's worth what?
[159:46.59]Okay.
[159:47.63]I got three darts.
[159:56.81]What is it painted on there One credit Let's get a skill shot over here
[160:23.07]Oops.
[160:25.91]Are they all worth the same?
[160:27.85]Are they?
[160:28.17]Dude, we're getting all kinds of ideas for the carnival stream.
[160:38.17]You guys might get to do this.
[160:47.50]I think they're all just worth one.
[160:51.06]I'm gonna try to get like one of the cool ones up there.
[160:54.72]Sorry, that was worth a shot.
[160:56.91]Throw it at the guy.
[160:57.97]I'll take the hammer.
[161:04.47]Throw it straight up so it lands on your head.
[161:11.01]I can't... I can't.
[161:17.20]That went through that guy.
[161:18.00]Alright, I won.
[161:26.69]Alright, over here.
[161:27.11]This is the roll the ball one.
[161:32.59]Carnival stream.
[161:33.37]Oh, for those of you that don't know, at some point over the next couple of months, I'm working with a robotics team and a certain producer that is going to help make a Twitch robot-controlled carnival.
[161:52.52]That's like the next big stream.
[162:01.14]It should be a lot of fun.
[162:02.62]So, I need to roll this.
[162:05.10]And I'm not trying to... I don't want to give that many details because I don't want to obviously talk about it and say, Hey, this is what's going to happen.
[162:11.00]How cool is this?
[162:12.60]We're going to be here for like an hour.
[162:29.29]He's got to get it over the hump, right?
[162:31.58]Does it have to touch the thing in the back?
[162:36.44]You can go ahead and admit that there's going to be a dunk tank with you dressed as a clown.
[162:39.16]Yeah, but I've already said that.
[162:42.84]You guys already know that.
[162:44.66]I've been talking about that for months.
[162:48.16]Get in there.
[162:50.86]Shit.
[162:51.97]How much is this?
[162:57.51]Do we have to pay?
[162:58.23]No.
[163:00.75]You do not.
[163:03.63]Touch it.
[163:06.17]I never understood this game.
[163:07.29]Do you just have to get it to sit in that little well?
[163:09.35]Or does it have to touch the button?
[163:20.24]People play this game all the time and I just don't get it.
[163:29.10]Is it gonna be a random audience member chosen?
[163:32.06]No.
[163:33.10]Well, there's still a lot of ideas on the table, but the theory is that it's gonna be, like, Twitch control.
[163:37.38]Like, Twitch plays.
[163:40.14]So, you guys are all gonna be fighting with each other to try to shoot a pitching machine-controlled robot at the Dante.
[163:49.09]That's as hard as I can throw it.
[163:51.35]That was as hard as I could, and it didn't do it.
[164:16.74]And we're not going to talk about it anymore.
[164:21.36]Just know that it's hype.
[164:22.46]Does it matter where I'm looking?
[164:35.45]Just shoot it with the gun.
[164:43.79]I still don't understand.
[164:46.90]I don't understand.
[164:47.92]Where are the rules?
[165:01.04]I don't... I did it!
[165:02.89]I just did it!
[165:03.43]I did it!
[165:03.75]I win!
[165:05.57]I did it!
[165:13.23]Everybody clap for me now, I demand it!
[165:16.48]This is my stream.
[165:17.94]When I say clap for me, goddammit, that means you do.
[165:21.76]Like that.
[165:25.56]I don't think you can hit the button.
[165:27.92]I'm holding it as long as I possibly can.
[165:32.77]No, you don't hit the button.
[165:33.59]You just get one credit.
[165:34.33]Give me the hammer.
[165:36.55]That's a golden hammer.
[165:37.41]Alright, what else we got?
[165:47.92]Ooh, basketball shot.
[165:54.02]My turn.
[165:58.42]Gotta hit all three of them?
[166:07.12]I'm actually pretty good at this when I do this in real life.
[166:11.24]I just jump so high and throw it really high in the air.
[166:18.88]Okay, hold on, I can do this.
[166:31.97]Where is he aiming this?
[166:38.48]I feel like he's not aiming in the right spot!
[166:48.42]Well, that was pathetic.
[166:49.68]If you do that at the carnival, oh, you better not be around a bunch of friends.
[166:56.78]You can't even make it halfway up?
[166:58.08]Come on.
[166:58.80]You can do that.
[167:14.17]I got it.
[167:14.55]Okay, I gotta get three in a row, though.
[167:21.16]What the hell was that?
[167:25.06]No, I gotta do more.
[167:25.78]I gotta do three in a row.
[167:29.76]At least two in a row.
[167:38.41]Shit.
[167:40.07]Come on.
[167:47.35]I can do three in a row.
[167:57.10]Let's just do... I can do three.
[167:57.98]Let's do three in a row.
[168:00.44]I promise it'll happen.
[168:04.94]Found the spot, yeah.
[168:06.41]I kinda did.
[168:12.77]There's one.
[168:21.39]There's two!
[168:40.24]This game is fun.
[168:41.00]This is just a fun little time waster.
[168:55.92]Fuck.
[168:56.48]Just reset it.
[169:08.59]You promised.
[169:09.43]What did I promise?
[169:12.57]Wait, what did I promise?
[169:13.35]What are you talking about?
[169:15.57]What did I promise?
[169:23.06]You promised.
[169:27.20]You promised three shots in a row.
[169:28.38]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[169:32.00]What do you think of... I am promising that I'm going to get three in a row.
[169:37.20]So that means I'm going to do it until I get three in a row.
[169:47.81]Stop failing.
[169:54.05]Oh my god, you guys are getting in my head.
[170:08.02]That's not how you do it, son.
[170:10.10]I don't roll it?
[170:11.50]No, you don't.
[170:12.82]Oh, I had to roll.
[170:23.27]One.
[170:31.99]Two.
[170:34.07]Alright.
[170:34.92]Alright, kids.
[170:36.06]Okay, kids.
[170:37.24]I did it.
[170:39.14]Three.
[171:08.09]Imagine going to one of these things and paying the money just to have fun and do this, but you're trying to get three in a row and your other two balls, you just lift them up and put them on the ground and say, no, I want to do it again.
[171:20.96]What a fucking weirdo.
[171:22.29]That's not going to go in.
[171:24.85]Oh my god, I'm fucking going to lose my mind.
[171:26.81]Just...
[171:32.85]I'm just gonna grab this in one hand and crow hop and just push, shot put, throw it as hard as I can.
[171:41.92]Did that just go behind me?
[171:47.31]How does that make any sense?
[171:59.20]Why is this not doing this now?
[172:00.98]How did I, what am I, what am I doing wrong?
[172:03.36]Alright, I got this exact spot that I need.
[172:27.31]I know exactly where to go.
[172:28.35]It's right on the wood.
[172:46.90]Oh my fucking god.
[172:49.30]Why is it doing this to me?
[173:00.51]I know, I promised.
[173:01.81]Just relax.
[173:04.78]You promised.
[173:06.20]It's like the teacher chaperoning the students.
[173:10.70]And the whole bus is sitting behind me.
[173:13.53]You promised!
[173:15.33]I'm trying!
[173:31.72]Alright, alright, this is the last one.
[173:33.07]I don't care if I don't do it.
[173:37.63]This is it.
[173:44.65]This is the one.
[173:45.19]This is the last one.
[173:45.81]I don't think it's going to happen right now.
[173:47.16]I'm going to go get a goddamn ice cream.
[173:56.24]Alright, kids.
[173:56.78]Alright, kids.
[173:57.46]I'm going to do it.
[174:08.68]Oh, just get on the bus.
[174:09.92]Get on the bus.
[174:10.42]Everybody get on the bus.
[174:12.33]Go, go, go on the bus.
[174:14.21]But you're not on the bus now.
[174:43.42]I can't.
[174:44.02]I can't do it.
[174:45.18]I can't do it.
[174:46.53]I don't think I can.
[174:48.17]I don't think I can do it.
[174:54.07]I really don't think I can do it.
[175:00.02]It's like lagging and bouncing.
[175:01.64]I can't do it.
[175:11.90]It's just like the angry guy.
[175:14.61]He just fucking whips it as hard as he can into the net.
[175:41.05]Oh my fucking god.
[175:42.49]Get me out of here.
[175:44.47]Just stop.
[175:44.93]Just get out.
[175:45.39]Just leave.
[175:45.99]Turn around.
[175:46.51]Just get on the bus.
[175:47.55]I'm out.
[175:47.93]I'm getting on the bus.
[175:51.49]I don't want any prizes.
[175:52.25]I don't deserve a prize.
[175:53.09]I want... Give me a donut.
[176:09.28]New text message.
[176:17.32]Oh, I'm out of money.
[176:20.39]I'm out of money.
[176:22.69]Was it a pizza?
[176:28.87]Okay, that was fucking... That was not... That was rude.
[176:36.54]I need more money.
[176:38.64]I need... Ugh.
[176:39.24]Are there any other games?
[176:41.80]Or is that the one that beat me?
[176:43.16]Is that the last one that's going to beat me?
[176:54.54]Do I still have my ride pass?
[177:02.78]Let's go in here.
[177:17.46]I'm just going to make myself and everybody watching sick, I think.
[177:21.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[177:24.26]No.
[177:25.52]No.
[177:26.68]No.
[177:27.41]Is it still here?
[177:29.55]Are we live?
[177:30.53]Oh, God.
[177:36.10]Get off.
[177:36.42]I don't want to be on this ride.
[177:39.18]Not when the internet's having a problem.
[177:50.81]What the fuck is happening?
[177:55.35]This doesn't make any sense.
[178:02.31]This is just strange.
[178:04.05]What are they building over here?
[178:05.04]A UFO.
[178:06.62]Oh, I know the UFO they're talking about.
[178:09.02]When you get in and you stand and your back goes against the wall and it spins you around really fast.
[178:19.99]Can I go in?
[178:22.67]No, fuck this thing.
[178:23.77]I hate this thing.
[178:24.51]I think I've only read, uh, read one of these.
[178:26.29]Yeah, read?
[178:27.57]Rode?
[178:29.71]I think I've only rode one of these once.
[178:36.22]And I said never again.

[200:43.73]Alright, there's two.
[200:45.63]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[200:47.77]There are nine slots left.
[200:50.67]Two out of nine has to be a boat.
[200:54.46]Okay, whatever.
[200:57.40]I made my money back.
[201:04.59]Oh, you piece of shit.
[201:05.49]Come on.
[201:16.94]Got the money back.
[201:25.72]Three in a row.
[201:26.88]They're just sitting in a row.
[201:28.15]Unbelievable.
[201:28.69]I need one more fish.
[201:40.09]No more twos.
[201:42.31]Ugh.
[201:48.74]I just need to win the boat.
[201:51.36]Or a fish.
[202:04.51]Alright, somebody just wrote, he's so bad.
[202:09.77]You can't be bad at picking random spaces.
[202:18.79]What does that even mean?
[202:27.91]Just give me the car.
[202:41.62]Stop being so bad.
[202:42.90]I'm making a mess.
[202:58.03]Alright, you guys can do the last ticket.
[202:59.29]You wanna show me how it's done?
[203:00.21]Let's see.
[203:00.73]Show me how it's done.
[203:02.45]Go ahead.
[203:03.51]Let's see how good you guys are at picking shit, huh?
[203:08.71]Let's see how everybody is at picking things.
[203:12.44]It's gonna be impossible to do this.
[203:18.04]I can't zoom in far enough.
[203:20.84]Do your best.
[203:26.32]Let's see how well you do.
[203:29.61]Nobody talking shit about how you're talking shit.
[203:33.51]Alright, go ahead.
[203:36.97]Actually, it is going to work pretty well.
[203:38.07]Alright.
[203:46.94]Right there in the middle.
[203:47.72]I see 25% of you clicking that one.
[203:49.82]That's the one we're going to do.
[203:52.48]26%.
[203:54.64]Okay, let's do it.
[203:58.63]Here it is.
[204:00.76]There's a three, 1250.
[204:03.44]Go again.
[204:05.66]What is the next scratch going to be?
[204:22.27]You guys are playing connect to four.
[204:25.41]That's how spread out this is.
[204:31.34]um the one that's 13% the one down the bottom right that's the only that has to be that one yeah the one that one that's 14% it's the car it's the $50 car not a bad choice not bad at all okay keep going
[205:14.84]By the way, all clicks on the left side on O, S, and H are not counted.
[205:23.18]There is no consensus here yet.
[205:25.08]Okay, there is.
[205:25.94]16% want to do that one over on the left.
[205:34.05]That's the one it's going to be, right here.
[205:35.55]Ooh, sorry.
[205:41.65]You were not, I was incorrect.
[205:46.29]Ready?
[205:47.85]Three, two, one.
[205:55.72]It's okay, chat.
[205:56.60]We can do it.
[206:09.88]Up in the corner.
[206:10.76]I'm doing it.
[206:11.30]Here we go. 30%.
[206:15.86]It's a four.
[206:16.98]Okay, you have two, three, four in the tank, so you're pretty spread out so far.
[206:21.21]Not bad.
[206:25.75]Where to next?
[206:33.24]You guys almost have a straight.
[206:34.18]Yeah, that's correct.
[206:44.35]mmm pretty split between down the bottom and no looks like it's right right there in the middle bottom middle somebody said at least we don't get ones oh there's a hundred dollar fish
[207:09.31]Ever so closer.
[207:10.09]You guys have almost every single one.
[207:11.55]That's a good thing to do, though, because then you can do a deduction.
[207:14.63]Statistically, you are making it easier for you.
[207:18.67]And I'm going to zero again.
[207:20.29]No, I'm not.
[207:20.87]Alright.
[207:21.43]We're good.
[207:28.67]We've proven that you're bad at RNG.
[207:30.81]That's not really 73% of people want to go that way, right?
[207:35.95]That many people want to click the top left one?
[207:39.23]That's unheard of.
[207:46.25]We should do chat plays view in battleship.
[207:51.60]I mean, we could do that, but that would require me to have another person in here, because I could just see.
[207:57.54]You guys have every single one.
[207:59.38]Alright, this is actually really good.
[208:10.04]Well, you don't have the boat yet.
[208:19.67]The last one that you're missing is the boat.
[208:23.89]I'm gonna go down and scratch the void if removed.
[208:29.01]Is there any explanation as to why the void, if removed, is scratchable?
[208:34.55]Why would they put that there?
[208:41.19]Alright, let's go.
[208:43.43]Oh, fuck.
[208:49.74]Oh, god.
[208:50.34]You guys are in a good spot.
[208:51.22]This is the best spot you could possibly be in.
[208:57.26]One more fish and you have the second best prize you can get on this ticket.
[209:03.41]Go for it.
[209:14.86]You guys are going for it?
[209:15.56]Could it be the coveted three in a row?
[209:17.49]It might be.
[209:18.19]I don't know.
[209:20.25]That's where you want to go.
[209:21.25]That's where we're going to go.
[209:23.41]Nope.
[209:25.07]Are you guys going to leave here with a measly $25?
[209:26.91]I hope not.
[209:27.19]Hmm.
[209:47.12]Better than me?
[209:47.90]I got 25, like, three times.
[209:51.66]Alright, is this your final answer?
[209:54.79]47%.
[209:56.87]Good luck, guys.
[210:02.86]Congratulations.
[210:04.58]My turn.
[210:07.80]I do one, you do one.
[210:08.60]Okay, my turn.
[210:24.32]I do one more.
[210:27.64]Alright, your turn.
[210:38.16]There's so much trash everywhere, I can't even pick it up.
[210:40.68]Alright, your turn, your turn.
[210:48.71]What's wrong with this one?
[210:51.07]What's the prize under there?
[210:52.05]Can you see?
[210:54.56]This one's broken.
[211:01.91]Oh, it was a three.
[211:03.11]It was a three.
[211:04.87]It actually was a three.
[211:07.11]Oh, no.
[211:09.97]Keep it going.
[211:21.15]It was the money symbol, but the other way.
[211:25.85]Kind of.
[211:29.84]Right here?
[211:30.20]You got it.
[211:32.48]First fish of the evening.
[211:35.90]Again.
[211:36.12]I would laugh so hard if you guys got three boats.
[212:00.22]You sure?
[212:00.56]Okay.
[212:03.44]Uh-oh.
[212:05.60]Sorry, guys.
[212:07.56]That was not the right spot to be in.
[212:16.39]If we get three boats, we get to keep the winnings.
[212:21.44]That's not written anywhere.
[212:28.12]Okay, here we go.
[212:32.10]Oh, it's a two.
[212:34.58]Two means none.
[212:38.26]If we get three boats, then you have to play Sam and Max.
[212:46.90]No.
[212:47.90]What?
[212:48.62]I'm gonna do that anyways.
[212:49.80]Alright, let's... Unanimous.
[213:04.63]Oh, shit!
[213:05.49]Alright, there's the boat.
[213:19.78]Go ahead.
[213:24.74]We need a better incentive.
[213:27.04]What's something that you want me to do so bad that I won't do?
[213:31.06]I mean, I've played two seasons of Sam & Max.
[213:33.40]It's not like I wouldn't do that.
[213:35.50]What incentive?
[213:43.51]Doki doki.
[213:44.57]No.
[213:45.95]By the way, there's no consensus here.
[213:47.21]I've got to wait another few minutes.
[213:50.76]Need another McChicken.
[213:57.34]Alright.
[213:58.61]We've got a majority.
[214:00.55]Well, not a majority.
[214:01.33]We have just a winner.
[214:04.79]1250.
[214:07.50]That leaves me one more chance to do it myself.
[214:55.38]No, no, no, no.
[214:55.90]I don't want to come back here.
[214:56.92]I want to go.
[214:57.30]Get out.
[215:36.83]That's it?
[215:43.54]That's not even enough!
[215:44.38]That's not even enough for me to do it again!
[215:46.30]No, no, no, I gotta...
[216:05.63]Oh, the F... Right.
[216:06.57]It's zoomed in.
[216:10.83]Alright, guys.
[216:11.45]I'm gonna... Here's the plan.
[216:12.49]Just relax for a minute.
[216:15.41]I am going to go get like $500.
[216:27.08]Just hang out.
[216:28.14]I'm just gonna go get... I'm gonna go just take a withdrawal of $500. $500.
[216:51.03]I need to do it again.
[216:53.21]That was a weak pull.
[217:32.31]I gotta get at least close.
[217:36.22]Do the voice.
[217:37.16]Oh, well, look at what you did there.
[217:40.42]Oh, gonna try to get a big fish here now.
[217:44.04]Oh, that pole was a big pole now.
[217:52.74]Oh, you got yourself ten tickets now.
[217:57.06]Oh.
[218:05.74]100 tickets?
[218:06.08]100 tickets?
[218:06.66]Oh, 100 tickets.
[218:07.42]No, it's not 100 tickets.
[218:09.34]You got yourself 1,000 tickets?
[218:12.15]Come on.
[218:14.49]I'm going to do it as hard as I can and then leave.
[218:52.94]No, wrong way.
[218:53.50]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[218:55.18]Wait.
[219:02.52]Is this fireworks?
[219:05.76]What do you got there?
[219:10.85]Where'd you get this?
[219:12.41]Where did you get this?
[219:17.49]Where'd you get that?
[219:23.52]Is he getting in trouble?
[219:37.66]Alright.
[219:40.14]I'm out of money.
[219:41.46]I'm out of money.
[219:42.12]I don't know what to do.
[219:43.66]The beach?
[219:45.58]Hold on.
[219:45.90]I need to go back into Dad's.
[219:48.29]Because I need to make some money.
[219:50.03]Let's get some money.
[219:54.59]You guys all stand in the way.
[220:10.24]Okay, just hang off for a little bit.
[220:11.72]Just chill.
[220:19.19]What's the best way for me to get money?
[220:20.43]I gotta be in the right spot.
[220:21.95]Right here?
[220:23.29]Right here looks good.
[220:29.72]The banana guy's worth 80 bucks.
[220:31.96]Where can I get the banana guy?
[220:40.12]You're right from the... Okay, I'm just gonna win the... I gotta just go win a few times.
[220:53.55]Off that stage.
[220:54.85]This guy... This is the person in the suit, though.
[220:56.61]I can't, like, bring that... Alright, I got the idea.
[220:58.49]Hold on.
[220:59.49]I know what I'm gonna do.
[221:12.35]Let's go to the pier.
[221:14.33]And I'm gonna go win the banana like 10 times.
[221:17.60]I'm gonna have like 3 grand.
[221:18.88]We're gonna buy like 40 scratch tickets.
[221:21.68]Where is he?
[221:24.48]It's the darts, right?
[221:26.67]That's the easiest thing in the game.
[222:39.63]I win.
[222:39.95]I didn't get anything?
[222:55.02]What?
[222:55.54]I know, it's loud.
[223:02.15]Just turn it down a little bit.
[223:15.54]Okay, that's three.
[223:16.24]I gotta do it a few more times.
[223:18.16]There's whack-a-mole?
[223:19.76]Where's whack- Where?
[223:20.60]Where's whack-a-mole?
[223:23.38]I didn't see whack-a-mole.
[223:30.64]Oh, let me help you here.
[223:31.28]I'm gonna turn this down.
[223:33.75]This is probably killing you.
[223:52.78]Oh my god.
[223:56.64]Did I mute it?
[223:57.42]I turned way down.
[224:00.53]You should be able to still hear it.
[224:16.08]Dang.
[224:18.18]Sir, why?
[224:20.62]What are you talking about?
[224:21.66]I'm...
[224:24.21]What's a movie I could watch at any time?
[224:27.63]Um... Gremlins 2.
[224:44.24]That's it, right?
[224:44.89]Okay, one more, one more.
[224:46.51]And that's 80 bucks.
[224:53.31]Because I'm in it.
[224:54.01]You guys know that friends of mine, way before any of you guys made that reference, friends of mine told me that same thing.
[225:03.82]That I'm just the guy with the tie.
[225:10.06]It looks, we're identical twins.
[225:18.89]Okay.
[225:21.28]You had a friend before Twitch?
[225:22.66]Yeah, I did.
[225:24.32]Okay, so I got 80 bucks there.
[225:53.28]There's gotta be a better way.
[226:00.98]I can swish it, I think.
[226:02.00]Hold on.
[226:04.62]Pay for it again.
[226:06.76]How many credits do I have?
[226:10.78]What's the...
[226:45.82]Okay, I can turn this back up.
[226:50.06]Uh, yeah, I didn't know I had that many credits there.
[226:51.46]Alright, so this is fine, so that's... How did I have to back a truck back here?
[227:09.70]Oh, no.
[227:11.90]Not good.
[227:13.46]That's all my inventory space.
[227:17.91]It'll be here when I come back.
[227:22.17]Let me find where the swish is.
[227:24.35]I'm gonna say if I go like... Let's go to the top, like up here.
[227:30.36]Okay, hold on a minute.
[227:30.98]This actually might work.
[227:34.32]I gotta find the swish.
[227:38.88]Right between the A and the B?
[227:45.02]Right under the A.
[227:49.80]Right?
[227:49.96]Like at the blue line.
[227:53.82]Nope.
[227:54.14]A little bit lower.
[228:01.73]Top of the backboard.
[228:09.05]Close.
[228:16.87]Top of the red.
[228:23.01]That's it.
[228:23.65]That's it.
[228:24.17]It's a fucking exploit.
[228:29.65]That's two!
[228:33.48]No, dude, I need three!
[228:34.62]I need three.
[228:35.34]I found it.
[228:35.72]I got it.
[228:36.00]That's the one right there.
[228:40.06]Right at the top of the red in the backboard.
[228:45.88]It's a swish, and here we go.
[228:47.56]Everyone get back off of the bus.
[228:49.77]Because this is gonna be it.
[228:57.46]Swish, again.
[228:58.50]Oh my God.
[229:10.97]I'm gonna get it, I'll do it.
[229:12.19]It's gonna happen.
[229:13.05]Why do I choke on every third ball?
[229:25.39]Why?
[229:30.39]Just get it up there.
[229:31.25]I just started itching my armpits.
[229:45.88]Do it again.
[229:50.92]Right there.
[229:56.37]How does it change from the last time?
[230:05.13]How did it change from the last time?
[230:15.60]Consistent power?
[230:16.42]I'm... I am.
[230:17.82]I'm holding it down the whole time.
[230:19.47]That's why I'm trying to find the one spot where I can be in.
[230:23.43]It's probably something stupid, like... Yeah, like somebody said, the wind.
[230:26.31]I wouldn't be surprised.
[230:47.69]Yeah, I know it sways in my hands.
[230:49.23]That's why I've been waiting for it to get in the middle.
[230:54.03]It goes back and forth.
[230:55.41]That's why the line in the middle, I'm trying to keep it just right in the middle.
[231:00.76]That's why every time I've waited until it was in the middle.
[231:04.38]Like that.
[231:20.02]There's variance.
[231:20.76]There's some kind of variance when you throw it.
[231:25.86]It's never going to happen.
[231:26.68]You have to get lucky.
[231:31.88]No, I don't want to... I want to stop this.
[231:34.90]I can't even click done.
[231:36.39]I can't get out of here.
[231:39.57]I'm stuck here now.
[231:40.37]Because I have no inventory space.
[231:47.49]Alright, get this shit out of the way.
[231:51.51]Free stuff, kids.
[231:52.61]Take it.
[232:37.73]It counts!
[232:38.71]It counts.
[232:39.37]It counts.
[232:40.33]Counts, counts, counts, counts, counts.
[232:49.15]Oh, people are going to say it didn't count.
[232:51.78]It counts.
[232:52.28]It went in and went out.
[232:53.98]In real basketball, if it does that, it counts.
[233:03.16]It counts.
[233:03.51]It counts.
[233:03.97]No, it counts.
[233:04.37]It counts.
[233:04.65]It's over.
[233:05.27]I win.
[233:07.05]In real basketball, if it goes in and then goes out, it counts.
[233:17.01]Yeah, I went.
[233:18.17]I did it.
[233:18.53]I did it three times in a row.
[233:25.62]Alright.
[233:27.10]Okay.
[233:28.32]Cool, guys.
[233:29.28]Thanks for watching the video.
[233:32.00]Weird how I did that first try.
[233:36.47]Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.
[234:02.18]Wait, can I scan these and take them out?
[234:04.62]Like, and pull them out?
[234:09.29]No, I can't.
[234:12.05]I can't scam the machine.
[234:18.35]What are these worth?
[234:20.91]They're worth $14 apiece.
[234:23.77]That's actually really good.
[234:28.19]How much are the cats worth?
[234:30.19]11.
[234:30.85]So why would I even get the cat?
[234:33.07]It's worth less.
[234:56.77]That's a lot of money.
[235:12.57]Is it giving to me in ones?
[235:32.17]Alright, I got 228 bucks.
[235:37.87]Alright, that's enough for... good old scratch tickets.
[235:55.28]Get this fucking mess out of the way.
[236:16.87]How many can I get?
[236:18.69]Like, eight?
[236:19.97]Ten?
[236:28.80]Okay, I'm gonna do the first three, and then you guys can do one.
[236:31.52]Alright, cool.
[236:38.32]Slow down.
[236:40.20]I got two cars.
[236:40.80]I got a boat.
[237:23.36]Come on, something, look at how many spaces there are.
[237:26.42]Oh my god.
[237:33.27]I'm gonna do a technique.
[237:46.21]The whole bottom row and then the whole top row.
[237:51.97]It's our turn.
[237:52.68]No, it's not.
[237:53.17]Not yet.
[239:03.58]Why are they missing spaces?
[239:24.28]Got it!
[239:24.80]Four bucks!
[239:26.36]Yes, I am brute forcing scratch tickets.
[239:28.64]Yes, I am.
[239:31.66]Okay, they're deleting spaces.
[239:35.78]I'm out.
[239:36.76]Alright, here, your turn.
[239:57.02]Okay.
[239:59.02]Here, you can do the... Let me do this one.
[240:04.14]Okay, you can do this one.
[240:05.15]You can do the... Yeah, here.
[240:06.43]You can do this one.
[240:08.91]Here you go.
[240:10.59]Wait, not yet.
[240:11.03]I have to zoom it in.
[240:25.86]Okay.
[240:27.64]We want the other one?
[240:29.50]We want the other one.
[240:30.30]We want... Alright, okay.
[240:31.88]Alright.
[240:36.19]You can do that one here.
[240:37.21]Alright, you can do this one.
[240:41.77]OK, go ahead.
[240:55.74]I don't know if I can even click this one.
[241:02.69]I'll try.
[241:06.02]Ooh, it's the trunkful.
[241:09.20]$50.
[241:09.24]Nice work so far, guys.
[241:11.08]Can you keep it up?
[241:25.12]Oh, you guys... Oh, I don't know what... You guys... You're clicking it.
[241:29.98]I guess you're clicking it.
[241:45.92]uh did you get the ad because I just played ned apparently commercial break failed commercial breaks are only allowed once every eight minutes how does a commercial break fail that doesn't make any sense I just clicked run ad no sorry it didn't work but you can't click that again
[242:18.74]Alright, well, uh, I can't do it.
[242:21.54]I tried.
[242:22.54]Do it again.
[242:29.71]Try again.
[242:41.39]It's because nobody wants to sponsor you.
[242:43.64]I don't need a sponsorship.
[242:46.86]I have 5,000 friends here.
[242:54.07]Think I need a sponsorship?
[243:06.18]He thinks we like, he thinks we're friends.
[243:10.69]They think we're friends.
[243:12.52]He thinks we're friends.
[243:14.14]Why are we both lying to each other?
[243:15.34]What are you talking about?
[243:16.66]Don't act like that.
[243:17.38]There's a forest.
[243:23.42]How are you guys?
[243:33.68]Jeremy, we're not real.
[243:34.70]You're very real.
[243:35.40]All of you.
[243:44.29]Hmm.
[243:45.79]Very split on this one.
[243:48.35]Looks like this is going to be the one.
[243:51.79]We have five community subs that just came in.
[243:57.10]Thank you for the five community subs.
[243:59.38]It was Piffinator.
[244:01.70]Thank you, Piff.
[244:04.10]Guys aren't doing so well on this one.
[244:05.94]But thanks for the community subs.
[244:10.34]I just burped really loud.
[244:11.84]Hopefully you didn't hear that.
[244:18.09]Win.
[244:23.00]Which one?
[244:23.48]Where do you want me to go?
[244:25.30]I have to get the car eventually.
[244:34.27]We're going over here.
[244:36.51]You're almost done.
[244:38.75]One more three and that's it, guys.
[244:46.47]Oh, click over here.
[244:47.43]Click, click, click feet.
[244:49.65]No, that's okay.
[244:50.13]That's like the soda machine.
[244:56.34]Torpedo sneak.
[244:57.56]Thanks for the five community subs.
[245:01.74]Another five gifter coming through.
[245:03.88]Thank you so much.
[245:05.98]Congratulations to the people that got those subs.
[245:11.79]Right here.
[245:12.11]Oh, no.
[245:14.21]Oh, no.
[245:14.95]Oh, no.
[245:17.49]What are you guys gonna do now?
[245:20.27]Tingy!
[245:20.65]Thanks for five community subs, Tingy.
[245:23.04]That was five, ten, fifteen community subs.
[245:26.60]Back to back to back.
[245:27.28]Thanks, guys.
[245:36.33]Right here?
[245:40.13]First fish.
[245:49.15]Where is the next fish?
[245:50.21]Gnarly five community subs.
[245:52.55]Even more, yeah.
[245:53.51]More back to back to back to back here.
[245:55.27]More.
[245:55.75]Another one.
[245:56.27]Five community subs from Gnarly.
[245:57.59]Five from Invader Ler.
[246:00.65]Invader L-E-R.
[246:01.81]Thank you, both of you, for the community subs.
[246:06.75]Much love to all of you.
[246:07.53]Thank you.
[246:13.66]You got one more.
[246:14.70]I'm tinging it with another five community subs.
[246:17.38]Subs just rolling in.
[246:21.24]Will they get the trunk?
[246:23.04]Who knows?
[246:25.08]Thank you for the five community subs.
[246:28.53]That was like fucking 30, 40 back to back there.
[246:31.91]And there's even more.
[246:32.59]Magellan, thanks for the five community subs.
[246:35.51]This is the one here and this is it.
[246:37.43]Okay.
[246:38.09]If you guys don't get this, then I get to buy five more and just spam them.
[246:42.42]You actually got it.
[246:42.98]Holy shit, they did it.
[246:43.88]Okay.
[246:44.12]$50 winner.
[246:51.74]Nice work, guys.
[246:53.12]That's my turn.
[246:56.18]Give me another spade.
[247:22.27]Alright, I won too.
[247:23.85]I won too.
[247:30.93]I have to win on this one though.
[247:32.53]I got two for the price of one.
[247:33.57]You see, that two came out.
[247:38.96]Thanks for winning the $50, guys.
[247:40.04]I'm putting it to great use.
[247:53.83]It's my turn to get the car.
[247:55.21]I have to match you guys.
[248:03.70]There can't be alright in this area.
[248:06.52]Oh my god.
[248:07.24]There's a boat.
[248:13.19]I did it too.
[248:14.53]I did it too.
[248:16.35]We're even.
[248:17.37]I did it too.
[248:28.50]And I'm going to get the fish.
[248:30.80]What happened?
[248:49.04]Okay, come on.
[248:50.88]I can get a fish here.
[248:59.15]Damn it.
[249:05.48]I can't click the space, it's empty.
[249:10.92]Come on.
[249:18.10]Ooh, up in... No, I can't say it.
[249:21.99]Holy shit, I got a hot fire.
[249:30.83]Whoa!
[249:31.83]Okay, I need your help.
[249:33.11]I need everybody's help.
[249:33.91]This is 250 bucks.
[249:35.45]I need your help.
[249:35.83]This is the ultimate win.
[249:39.23]Help me.
[249:40.29]We need to do this together.
[249:55.68]The broken space?
[249:56.46]I don't know if I can click the broken space.
[250:04.15]I'll try.
[250:04.57]That wasn't it.
[250:11.64]That wasn't it.
[250:13.30]Got it wrong.
[250:17.02]I had to click that like ten times.
[250:21.84]You think it's going to be three in a row?
[250:23.24]It might, but it might be three in a row this way.
[250:27.61]Not this way.
[250:28.13]I don't know.
[250:28.67]I guess...
[250:31.81]alright oh guys come on no no it's not working thankfully there's still plenty of spaces because I that's the only one I have two of okay right to the right see if it's three in a row
[251:01.89]Hot fire, hot fire, hot fire.
[251:05.10]No, it's water.
[251:08.68]There are now two waters in play.
[251:15.55]This is our only opportunity to get the ultimate win on any of these tickets, I think.
[251:30.25]You know, there's an equal chance of winning no matter where you click, and this is all pointless.
[251:34.22]What are you talking about?
[251:39.96]What do you mean?
[251:51.29]God damn it.
[252:25.97]Going into a gas station and seeing this shit.
[252:29.03]This would be really, really, really fucking bad.
[252:35.82]I would have gotten thrown out a long time ago.
[252:39.29]Hold on.
[252:44.31]Come on.
[252:44.99]Ah!
[252:56.76]Not a bad start.
[252:59.21]Come on!
[253:01.73]Pawn the old tickets.
[253:12.96]I can't actually do this, right?
[253:16.50]Well, I got enough of one more.
[253:30.25]What's with the fours?
[253:31.21]This is... I can do it again.
[253:46.95]I only clicked on threes.
[254:02.43]Come on.
[254:03.53]Just let me win a bet.
[254:04.53]Let me get a hot ticket item.
[254:16.82]We're just going to zero.
[254:17.74]Who cares?
[254:18.10]We're going to one cent.
[254:28.07]I got it.
[254:28.53]I got it.
[254:28.87]I got it.
[254:29.07]I got it.
[254:29.47]I'll fix it.
[254:40.63]Alright, we're good.
[254:41.13]We're good.
[254:43.57]Let's go try to... How much can I get for the tickets?
[255:02.12]Can I just feed them into there?
[255:04.05]If I look up high enough?
[255:15.68]50 cents?
[255:19.38]It's not even worth doing this.
[255:21.58]I can go just get money from Uncle.
[255:23.98]Faster than this.
[255:34.27]Yeah, I might as well just go on the money sheen.
[255:36.65]Money sheen?
[255:38.09]The money machine.
[255:39.83]Rather than just throw in like the crumpled up ramen bags.
[255:49.50]What is that?
[255:50.34]Three bucks?
[255:51.10]Five bucks?
[255:52.12]Eleven bucks.
[255:56.83]Six bucks.
[255:59.09]No.
[255:59.91]Just leave them.
[256:04.91]I'm still holding the arcade tickets?
[256:08.03]Oh.
[256:12.86]Let's go back and get some money.
[256:16.93]I'm gonna go to the beach.
[256:20.52]We haven't been here yet.
[256:21.18]Are there any games on the beach?
[256:30.80]There's fireworks at the beach.
[256:33.68]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[256:43.58]How much are these? $10?
[256:53.72]Five dollars, ooh.
[257:01.96]How do I use it?
[257:03.76]Like that, okay.
[257:15.46]Taxi, taxi!
[257:33.20]Alright, I want to go back here.
[257:34.24]I'm going to get some more money.
[257:36.48]And then I want to... What's the... I want to... What do I want to do?
[257:41.44]I've got to play more of these.
[257:42.78]I'm fucked.
[257:44.21]I really want to play these again.
[257:49.23]Which one do I want to play?
[257:57.25]Let's go get money from dad first.
[258:06.68]What's the most expensive thing?
[258:11.83]That's like the ultimate win, right?
[258:14.39]100,000 tickets is to get the boombox.
[258:21.45]I think I can do it.
[258:26.11]How do I escape this?
[258:50.86]Cover your ears.
[259:06.89]What can I sell the boombox for?
[259:08.37]That's the question.
[259:10.01]Probably a lot.
[259:24.03]Okay, let's go play the... Which is the one that's easier?
[259:30.95]The ball drop one or the hockey?
[259:50.96]You can tell I've lost a step since when I won this last time.
[259:57.50]No, no, no, no.
[259:59.20]This one.
[260:01.18]This, just go for the ones that are 500.
[260:11.63]This is probably the best way to do this.
[260:12.81]5, 10, 15, 20, 21, 23, 24, 45.
[260:14.53]Alright, I have to get 10 of these to get 5,000.
[260:26.97]I missed.
[260:27.29]I need to get 200 balls.
[260:36.11]Well, that's not gonna happen.
[260:41.94]200.
[260:47.99]At least I'll be able to get... Well, we're getting a good start here.
[260:56.37]Not bad, $1500.
[260:57.23]The hockey game is $2500 if you get all the pucks, yeah.
[261:09.31]Tickets?
[261:12.38]One more ticket.
[261:13.02]Oh, right.
[261:17.20]Alright, $1000.
[261:17.74]What about this one?
[261:18.24]How bad is this one?
[261:23.78]What are we looking for?
[261:24.58]The green ones, right?
[261:26.72]Just go anywhere.
[261:35.57]Isn't there green rings down there somewhere?
[261:40.52]See?
[261:41.16]Dizzy Bird!
[261:42.44]I wasn't making... Oh, that's the name of this game!
[261:45.74]When I was shooting the basketball, people were like, oh, at least it's not Dizzy Bird.
[261:49.80]Not bird, Dizzy Bird.
[261:51.12]I'm like, what the fuck are they talking about?
[261:52.78]That's what I was talking about.
[262:00.75]That's a pretty good haul right there.
[262:06.73]It's not as effective, though.
[262:10.97]Come on, pick up like fucking eight of them.
[262:22.24]I'm gonna try to get this 100 right here.
[262:23.59]Grab that one right there.
[262:24.81]Slide it.
[262:25.81]Oh!
[262:27.15]Didn't get it.
[262:30.73]That's a pretty good haul.
[262:37.56]It's a pretty good haul.
[262:42.02]Okay.
[262:46.70]Okay.
[262:49.32]Let's give Dizzy Bird a try.
[262:50.74]I feel like he's going to help us out here a little.
[263:00.79]Oh man, I thought I did it first.
[263:02.41]Fucking try.
[263:03.27]I thought I did it.
[263:04.07]Oh well.
[263:04.61]I tried.
[263:04.95]It was close.
[263:10.13]What about this one?
[263:13.68]This one's pretty good.
[263:14.38]Pond, right?
[263:20.62]Get in the Mega Jackpot.
[263:21.54]Come on.
[263:25.69]What's that?
[263:26.01]Mystery?
[263:28.31]Mystery bonus?
[263:33.77]Alright, I'll take it.
[263:35.88]That sounds pretty good to me.
[263:36.76]Nice.
[263:42.14]Shit.
[263:43.48]I gotta get that.
[263:44.04]What's the Mega Jackpot?
[263:45.40]It's not even listed.
[263:48.07]Jackpot!
[263:51.12]It's 2,100.
[263:51.98]What's the mega jackpot?
[263:53.10]It's not even listed.
[264:06.36]Add a bonus ball?
[264:10.86]We're going to wait for the jackpot to come back again.
[264:13.74]Pretty close.
[264:22.08]Under the table?
[264:22.78]What about... Oh, it's just doing it.
[264:29.33]I didn't even click.
[264:33.87]What does this mean?
[264:37.59]Get in there!
[264:42.29]Awww.
[264:44.55]Did that just come out of the side of the machine?
[264:54.72]There are tickets over there.
[264:57.13]You're right.
[264:57.51]There are tickets that way.
[264:59.71]Bonus ball.
[265:03.43]Get in there!
[265:08.87]Bonus ball.
[265:13.95]Get in.
[265:14.19]I thought it was going to go in the jackpot.
[265:15.39]$50.
[265:18.37]I just won $50 right there.
[265:19.41]Bonus ball.
[265:24.07]The Balla Koala just gave me $50, and then I got the jackpot.
[265:27.31]This is fucking 10,000 tickets.
[265:28.48]This is going to be a big haul.
[265:32.40]Bet you can't get the double green on Dizzy Bird.
[265:37.50]Thanks for the 50 bucks, Balla Koala.
[265:42.70]But first of all, we've got to talk about the big haul that's coming up through here.
[265:46.75]I reset both the jackpots.
[265:50.87]Two mega jackpots, do it.
[265:58.77]Alright, this is like 12,000 tickets.
[265:59.73]Jesus Christ!
[266:00.07]How is that not 12,000?
[266:00.41]What?
[266:00.51]The top was like 4,800 and the... What do you... What's this mean?
[266:03.19]What do you mean by that?
[266:27.36]Alright, we're like 10% of the way there.
[266:37.06]14 tickets, guys.
[266:37.66]Who cares?
[266:38.16]Who even wants these?
[266:40.22]Alright, I'm... Okay, let's do hockey.
[266:43.80]I gotta get hockey.
[266:44.36]That's 500.
[266:44.56]I'm alright with this.
[266:58.04]So it's too slow.
[266:58.94]It's too slow.
[266:59.68]The fish game.
[267:04.14]The fish game's not going to... The fish game's going to be very inefficient.
[267:09.50]Just like the Bruins.
[267:14.22]What?
[267:21.23]Get in there!
[267:24.07]We want the bird game.
[267:25.39]No.
[267:26.25]That's not efficient.
[267:29.56]This is more efficient.
[267:30.64]If I can... I gotta get hockey at least once.
[267:32.48]It's 2,500 guaranteed tickets.
[267:34.08]Alright, I gotta be earlier.
[267:44.15]Like, right now.
[267:50.12]Put the 500 in there.
[267:52.66]Alright, I can do it.
[267:55.18]The bird is not efficient.
[267:56.40]The bird sucks.
[267:56.94]It's not gonna help us at all.
[268:05.28]This is actually turning out to be very inefficient as well.
[268:10.72]Am I scoring on my own goal?
[268:24.16]Alright, I got the C. We've got plenty of time.
[268:29.87]There's shitload of tickets on the ground.
[268:32.75]O. H. Oh, you kidding me?
[268:34.63]Really?
[268:59.09]Do they stay forever?
[268:59.90]They have to, right?
[269:05.92]Well, the one, at least the one cool part is the soundtrack, the sound right now is doing the thing when you go into a place like Radio Shack that has a keyboard.
[269:19.18]And it's on display and you're allowed to play with it.
[269:21.72]You just do the same four chords, like the same chord five, like a thousand times.
[269:25.87]That's like all I hear.
[269:29.65]You turn it on, you put it on like the horn and you just press down on the same chord.
[269:37.27]It was hard for me to say that because it was so loud in my ear that it was making me hard to talk.
[269:51.32]I was getting speech jammed by the fucking RadioShack keyboard.
[269:54.38]Alright, I just need a Y and an H.
[270:07.22]There it is.
[270:10.70]Bye.
[270:18.97]Alright, sir, sir, sir, sir.
[270:21.59]Can you stop that, please?
[270:22.67]You're really pissing off all the customers here.
[270:26.73]2,000.
[270:26.89]Alright, I can move on.
[270:31.32]Move on to the next machine.
[270:41.26]2200 tickets.
[270:41.86]Alright, let's get them.
[270:44.04]I don't want to play again.
[270:49.31]Alright, let's go.
[270:50.47]Feed it in.
[270:51.27]How many do I have?
[270:51.81]10% of the way there.
[271:03.82]Alright, what's the most... What about these ones?
[271:07.32]No, this thing's really bad, right?
[271:11.83]What about the Stackums?
[271:18.72]What gives the most tickets?
[271:22.14]This thing is awful.
[271:23.18]The Big Bass is the worst machine.
[271:24.80]It gives like four tickets, guys.
[271:26.90]Even if it was a thousand.
[271:28.56]That's not worth it.
[271:31.10]I could go get a thousand right now from the hockey game.
[271:38.26]Oh, you got yourself ten tickets?
[271:40.38]That's terrible.
[271:46.11]I didn't give this one a chance.
[271:52.04]So you knock down all the stuff.
[271:56.02]Don't touch shovel handle.
[272:22.72]How do we get all the chests?
[272:28.62]That's all chests.
[272:37.57]That's it?
[272:39.05]What's the top one?
[272:40.83]Do I have to get all the balls off?
[272:46.67]I'm going to do this like a lawn.
[272:47.51]Alright, I'm ready.
[272:48.95]Here we go.
[273:23.96]Ooh.
[273:26.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[273:26.96]Why was it... Was it not counting these treasures before?
[273:35.81]Let's go... Yeah, inside out.
[273:48.76]What?
[273:49.34]Oh, I touched the shovel.
[273:50.36]Shit.
[273:52.01]Do it again.
[274:01.80]Inside, out.
[274:30.56]I'm out of time.
[274:38.10]I feel like this one's too rigged.
[274:39.30]I'm going to do one more technique.
[275:15.42]It's not a bad technique if you go around in a circle and you push out.
[275:22.57]Last try.
[275:25.09]Yeah, it's like scrubbing a toilet.
[275:27.55]It is.
[275:29.77]Let's try that again, but I'm going to start right from the middle.
[275:31.57]I'm just going to do a circle around it.
[275:34.82]Just get right here.
[275:36.08]Don't touch it.
[275:36.58]You just go like this.
[275:38.38]Oh, fuck.
[275:38.80]That's how you do it.
[275:39.40]I know.
[275:39.62]That's how you do it.
[275:40.40]You got to go get a toilet brush.
[275:43.62]You just got to be very careful.
[276:19.35]This game's stupid.
[276:22.61]This is dumb.
[276:37.20]Alright, what about the coin ones?
[276:47.57]He's so bad Stop that stop saying that you know it makes me angry hold on I'm gonna do this I'm gonna stop at the minor prize this time and see how many tickets it is.
[277:06.82]Oh
[277:18.43]Alright.
[277:19.55]How many tickets is the minor prize?
[277:28.77]What a joke.
[277:31.37]Not even worth it.
[277:34.57]Is this... How much was this one?
[277:35.88]100?
[277:37.86]Does it increase in value as you go up?
[277:46.54]I bet you it does.
[277:56.65]Did I just fucking do that first try?
[277:58.51]I did.
[277:59.03]So how much is the top row?
[278:07.16]It has to be worth something.
[278:08.38]If this is 100 tickets, then why the hell would you ever do this?
[278:11.80]Alright.
[278:12.34]Well.
[278:13.16]Okay.
[278:14.88]Sure.
[278:15.22]That sounds good to me.
[278:16.95]Just do that every time.
[278:30.80]I can do this.
[278:50.49]No.
[278:51.73]Early?
[278:52.75]A little too early.
[278:53.41]I can hold it a little longer.
[278:56.31]I need to do this 88 times.
[279:08.81]And you want me to do the bass game?
[279:10.51]What's more reliable?
[279:15.55]I did it too high.
[279:16.25]Too high.
[279:19.67]The bird is faster.
[279:30.11]Let us play the lottery tickets again.
[279:32.67]I have to have money before I do that.
[279:34.15]And I make money by doing this and then...
[279:37.32]Get in the boom box and sell in the boom box.
[279:39.62]That's it.
[279:39.92]Alright, this is stupid.
[279:43.63]I did it first try.
[279:44.33]Nobody, who cares?
[279:44.89]Just give me my thousand tickets and get me out of here.
[279:55.32]Alright, prize balls?
[280:01.60]This seems the fastest.
[280:12.49]1,500 is... Ski ball is the most reliable?
[280:19.13]Is it, though?
[280:19.82]How many tickets do you get for doing ski ball?
[280:33.29]Come on, that's a good grab.
[280:34.87]Yeah, it is.
[280:42.93]Do ball drop.
[280:43.71]You can ace it every time.
[280:44.83]Is it 500 or 1,000?
[280:46.23]Doing the ball drop.
[280:53.31]I mean, this is two grand.
[281:01.76]You see what I'm saying?
[281:03.32]How long was that?
[281:05.18]30 seconds?
[281:05.46]5, 10, 15.
[281:06.80]That was 15, 10.
[281:07.48]Alright.
[281:08.02]Hold on.
[281:08.52]Let me feed that through.
[281:22.39]13%.
[281:23.53]How much do the headphones sell for?
[281:24.69]I think 100.
[281:25.51]Let me see.
[281:31.56]How efficient am I in this one?
[281:37.42]I'm usually pretty efficient, right?
[281:39.18]What is it?
[281:39.44]What's the jackpot? 500?
[282:04.99]500, right?
[282:05.21]Alright, I've got... This is the only game they come over to congratulate you on.
[282:15.72]Do it again.
[282:16.06]Let's go.
[282:16.36]I just need to do this, like, 115 times.
[282:47.67]Okay.
[282:48.75]Do it until I don't do it.
[282:49.62]And...
[283:25.86]Mr. Go until I lose.
[284:14.03]What is so funny?
[284:14.63]This.
[284:35.89]Got it.
[284:38.27]Wait.
[284:53.01]Only, never before is anything like this ever possible.
[285:12.64]I fucking blew it.
[285:13.66]I need to move on.
[285:15.24]I'm like what I'm doing right now.
[285:19.32]I'm playing a fake arcade machine.
[285:23.32]This is a real version of this and there's like 5,000 people watching me do the fake arcade machine to try to make a hundred thousand fake tickets to buy a fake boombox to scratch fake lottery tickets on stream.
[285:43.65]It's like starting to get in my head.
[285:50.20]Alright, so.
[285:52.96]Okay, I need to fucking relax.
[286:01.77]What do I have, 15%?
[286:09.87]What's the most... Okay, ski ball.
[286:11.07]Somebody said do ski ball.
[286:15.63]Is this actually efficient?
[286:17.03]If I just do it right down the middle?
[286:21.90]That's 40.
[286:22.84]A little bit higher, right?
[286:27.30]Right before the yellow?
[286:29.12]No, that's too high.
[286:30.48]That's too higher?
[286:31.96]Higher?
[286:32.31]That's too higher.
[286:34.23]Sorry guys, a little too higher.
[286:43.97]There it is.
[286:50.78]What was up with that?
[286:53.04]Jerma, wake up, please.
[286:54.28]Stop that.
[287:10.74]You want to know what your tarot reading said?
[287:12.28]My friend says you'll freak out.
[287:14.64]No, I don't want to do tarot reading.
[287:16.23]I thought about it would be fun to do like a tarot reading on stream of myself, but it's probably gonna be like, like death, death, death, puke, puke, like you're gonna lose all your money.
[287:33.36]What do I get for that?
[287:34.48]For that pathetic display.
[287:40.33]That's just, that's not bad, hold on.
[287:57.54]What is up with this physics?
[288:07.63]It's the claw.
[288:08.97]Somebody did the... That was another thing I was laughing at.
[288:11.45]Somebody did the math, and they said, just do the balloon claw game.
[288:16.73]And try to get, what, 300, 500 balloons?
[288:21.37]And if you just do it efficiently, it'll take 22 minutes.
[288:24.19]And then I'm sitting there thinking, does that door really want to do that?
[288:29.10]I don't know if that's something I actually want to do.
[288:41.73]Come on, give me 600.
[288:48.50]You did the bird game for 54 minutes.
[288:54.92]Yes, that is also true.
[289:02.92]Alright, let's go... What about these?
[289:08.98]No, that's not that efficient either.
[289:11.62]Okay, I'm going to go for balloons for a little while until I can't take it anymore.
[289:26.03]You've been playing this for five hours.
[289:28.21]You can do 22 minutes on the balloons.
[289:31.25]Yeah, but there's a difference between 22 straight minutes of me picking up 500 ticket balloons.
[289:39.81]That's a different story.
[289:48.32]I missed.
[289:56.13]Bird game streams are entertaining to watch.
[290:19.91]You know, if it was allowed, 22 minutes is one episode of Spongebob.
[290:26.37]I would just put it on the screen and just do this.
[290:28.51]Alright, let's do it again.
[290:42.40]Hold on.
[290:42.80]What happens if you do... Can I overflow the balls?
[290:47.45]Put it on the background.
[290:48.47]No, I can't do that.
[290:49.57]I will get actually like terms of service screamed at.
[290:58.58]What's the red ones?
[291:01.34]How much are the red ones worth?
[291:02.22]$2.50?
[291:04.60]What happens if I get them all?
[291:20.89]Just have text-to-speech read a Spongebob script.
[291:29.15]No.
[291:31.77]Hold on.
[291:43.16]You can't fit that many characters in a text-to-speech program.
[291:48.58]Just read it and play every part.
[291:50.68]I can't do that in play.
[291:57.16]Hold on, let me just get out of this.
[292:07.91]Is it, is it, okay, is there a website where I can have that happen?
[292:12.11]That can take like a, that's too long to put in a text-to-speech box.
[292:27.62]You read it.
[292:34.06]I can't do that.
[292:36.10]Put it into Google Translate?
[292:44.39]Oh my god.
[292:46.39]Hold on.
[292:46.93]Let me... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[292:48.15]Is this even possible?
[292:58.01]This is spongebob.fan.
[292:59.59]This is the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy transcript.
[293:10.62]Is this actually the right one?
[293:11.72]Is this a fan one?
[293:14.05]This doesn't seem like very much dialogue.
[293:34.00]okay so this is the mermaid man and barnacle boy uh reenactment by and we're gonna do speed speed like three or four okay okay here we go just relax oh my god it's crashing my computer I think narrator ah the crusty crab

[294:07.88]Mermaid Man, through the double doors.
[294:10.56]Burst through the door, knocking the two fish away.
[294:12.88]Away.
[294:14.14]Narrator, and also these guys.
[294:16.60]Barnacle Boy enters the Krusty Krab.
[294:18.85]Barnacle Boy, I told you I'm not hungry, Mermaid Man.
[294:22.63]Mermaid Man, end nonsense.
[294:24.43]Barnacle Boy, we've got to keep up our strength for the fight against evil.
[294:28.27]Barnacle Boy, want to dive Mermaid Man, to the register.
[294:31.88]Runs to the register, away.
[294:34.00]Squidward, can I help you?
[294:36.00]It's too fast, it's too fast, it's too fast.
[294:39.98]And that's like the jokey, that's like the meme guy.
[294:42.78]It's gotta be somebody else.
[294:44.56]Alright, let's try this.
[294:46.54]Squidward, can I help you?
[294:48.98]Mermaid man, a double Krabby Patty and coral bits for me.
[294:53.10]And a silly meal for the lad.
[294:55.64]Barnacle boy, it's not for the toy.
[294:58.16]I just, I've gotta fit in the tights.
[295:00.35]Why, Kano?
[295:02.01]He smiles nervously.
[295:04.08]Squidward.
[295:05.04]Whatever.
[295:06.10]Five dollars.
[295:07.28]Please.
[295:08.88]Mermaid man.
[295:10.04]You got it.
[295:10.98]Bucky.
[295:12.44]Removes his left seashell cup.
[295:14.54]Opens the shell up like a clutch purse.
[295:16.86]And pulls out a metal nut.
[295:18.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[295:20.47]Did I get fucking linked to something fucked up here?
[295:25.19]Is this an actual real one?
[295:29.33]This is not some like fucked up weird like Mermaid Man porn thing, right?
[295:34.35]This is the episode.
[295:38.71]Okay.
[295:43.25]Close up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard.
[295:45.99]Squidward, no barnacle boy, confront Squidward.
[295:49.02]Listen, big nose, points at Mermaid Man.
[295:51.70]That guy has been saving your butt since before you were born.
[295:55.40]Don't you got a living legend discount or something?
[295:58.71]Squidward, this is a restaurant, not a lending library.
[296:02.45]Pokes Barnacle Boy, and who are you calling big nose?
[296:05.44]Pokes Barnacle Boy again, big nose.
[296:08.66]Both press noses against each other.
[296:11.32]Barnacle Boy gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward.
[296:15.68]Barnacle Boy, well, next time danger threatens.
[296:18.92]Don't expect any help from us.
[296:21.61]Squidward grabs the bill.
[296:23.65]Sarcastically, I'm shaken.
[296:26.12]Hey, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[296:28.36]SpongeBob slowly breaks through wall.
[296:31.63]Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy must get autograph.
[296:35.55]Stretch his arm to pull a pen from Tom's shirt pocket and stretch his second arm to grab a paper from the window.
[296:41.71]Mermaid Man, if you wanna grow up strong like me, shows his fat belly.
[296:45.79]Shocking Barnacle Boy.
[296:46.82]You gotta leave room for seconds.
[296:49.44]Here comes our waiter.
[296:51.36]SpongeBob runs while making a weird face.
[296:53.88]Autograph.
[296:55.37]Barnacle Boy, holy sickow, it's that sponge kid.
[296:59.31]Mermaid Man, quick, lad, pants falls down to the invisible boat mobile.
[297:04.86]Runs outside while holding his pants away.
[297:08.74]Barnacle Boy, where do we park?
[297:11.36]Mermaid Man, uh, SpongeBob, can I have your autograph?
[297:14.68]Can I have your autograph?
[297:16.02]Can I?
[297:16.26]They're gone.
[297:17.82]Gasps, Mermaid Man's belt.
[297:20.66]Mermaid Man, wait, we'll find it with the invisible boat alarm.
[297:25.36]He pulls it out and makes a suppressor button.
[297:27.50]Why was he acting there?
[297:28.64]A car flickers in and out of visibility thrice, making beeps as well.
[297:32.22]There she is.
[297:33.76]They run over and jump in the car.
[297:36.34]Barnacle Boy hits the seat divider.
[297:38.52]Barnacle Boy, ee-ow, rubs his behind.
[297:41.26]I told you we should've got the automatic.
[297:44.03]SpongeBob, hey, guys, wait up.
[297:47.97]Pulling out Mermaid Man's bell.
[297:49.97]Slow motion, I've got something for you.
[297:52.65]Barnacle Boy, floor.
[297:54.56]Both speed off in the boat.
[297:56.96]SpongeBob, you forgot your belt.
[297:59.84]You forgot?
[298:00.62]Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away.
[298:02.68]Mermaid Man secret utility belt.
[298:05.47]The emblem of submersible justice.
[298:08.15]For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations and pants.
[298:13.22]I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands.
[298:16.53]well I guess I should return it makes one step in the boat's direction then sprints back to the kitchen with the belt on or not giggles I could just hang on to till after work all alone with mermaid man's belt I wonder what this button does presses the belt and a pickle barrel shrinks whoa grabs the shrunken barrel the small ray
[298:38.79]He giggles and smiles mischievously.
[298:40.35]Squidward, here's your shake, sir.
[298:43.83]He starts to hand him the shake, but he is startled by a loud noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle, causing him to accidentally drop the shake on the guy's head.
[298:52.49]The guy punches Squidward in the face and storms out.
[298:55.87]There are more flashes, noises, and giggles from the kitchen.
[298:59.65]Squidward gets up and he holds his head.
[299:01.51]J.R.R.
[299:03.19]SpongeBob hands a tiny Krabby Patty to a cockroach.
[299:06.32]There you go.
[299:06.86]Come again, sir.
[299:09.70]Squidward barges in.
[299:12.00]Squidward, SpongeBob, what's going on in here?
[299:16.16]Huh?
[299:17.00]SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula, and the cockroach is eating a Krabby Patty while sitting on a shrunken dining table.
[299:24.05]Why is everything all tiny?
[299:26.25]SpongeBob turns the belt around to hide it from Squidward.
[299:29.45]I don't know.
[299:31.13]Squidward, what do you got there?
[299:33.70]spongebob nothing squidward no really spongebob nothing squidward you've got something alright let's see it grabs spongebob and sees mermaid man's bell what the hell did I just get spongebob no no squidward gasps is that mermaid man's belt spongebob yes squidward wow I can't believe he'd lend it to you spongebob me either chuckles nervously

[300:08.31]SpongeBob, please don't tell.
[300:10.71]Squidward, angry.
[300:11.93]You stole it.
[300:13.61]SpongeBob, please don't tell.
[300:15.37]Squidward, oh, I'm telling.
[300:18.83]SpongeBob, Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure.
[300:25.42]Please don't tell.
[300:27.46]Squidward, uh-oh, points at the phone hanging on the kitchen wall.
[300:31.30]There's the phone.
[300:32.94]SpongeBob, don't.
[300:33.92]Lindsay, is the episode almost over?
[300:34.96]Squidward, I'm walking towards the phone.
[300:38.02]Slowly walks towards phone.
[300:39.12]How long is this episode?
[300:40.24]SpongeBob, no.
[300:42.69]Squidward, slowly reaches for the phone.
[300:44.89]I'm getting closer to the phone.
[300:47.11]SpongeBob, sobbing, do or not.
[300:50.29]Squidward, picks up the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man.
[300:53.55]And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
[300:56.95]SpongeBob, wails and tears himself.
[300:59.21]I'm begging you.
[301:01.12]Squidward, hello.
[301:02.78]I'd like to speak to Mermaid.
[301:04.34]SpongeBob shrinks Squidward.
[301:06.82]He lands on the table.
[301:07.82]What the?
[301:09.20]What?
[301:10.00]Phone hits Squidward on the head.
[301:11.70]Ow.
[301:12.92]Mermaid Man on phone.
[301:14.46]Hello?
[301:15.80]Hello?
[301:17.20]Squidward, what did you do to me?
[301:20.03]SpongeBob, I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it.
[301:24.59]Squidward, SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are going to be in really big trouble.

[302:25.52]SpongeBob, snatching Squidward?
[302:27.74]No!
[302:29.56]I can't let you do that.
[302:31.24]But there must be someone else who can help.
[302:34.01]Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience.
[302:38.05]He runs to Patrick's house, where Patrick is sleeping.
[302:40.83]Patrick.
[302:41.03]I can't do it anymore.
[302:41.83]I can't do it anymore.
[302:42.71]Okay, I'll do it like speed, like, five.
[302:45.72]I can't hear it anymore.
[302:46.66]Let's, uh, Mike, take us away, Mike.
[302:49.62]He runs to Patrick's house, where Patrick is sleeping.
[302:51.30]Patrick.
[302:52.26]Patrick.
[302:52.98]Patrick.
[302:53.70]Patrick.
[302:54.67]Patrick wakes up due to surprise and... Oh, hi, SpongeBob.
[302:58.97]SpongeBob, Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look.
[303:03.54]Shows Patrick the shrunken Squidward.
[303:05.36]Patrick, a Squidward action figure.
[303:07.26]Grabs Squidward, let me play with him.
[303:09.16]SpongeBob, no, Patrick.
[303:10.28]Just give me the ones in the corner.
[303:12.20]Imitates jet plane diving, machine gun fire, and explosion noises dive bomb.
[303:15.86]SpongeBob, Patrick.
[303:17.12]Patrick, about to punch Squidward, and then comes a giant fist.
[303:19.85]SpongeBob, Patrick, no, that's not an action figure.
[303:22.81]That's the real Squidward.
[303:24.01]I shrunk him by accident.
[303:25.56]Patrick, oh, about to punch Squidward anyway, and then comes a giant Squidward screams.
[303:29.02]SpongeBob, stops Patrick.
[303:30.06]Wait, you don't understand.
[303:30.96]This is serious.
[303:32.44]I don't know how to unshrink him.
[303:33.52]He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
[303:36.20]Patrick, oh, don't worry about it.
[303:38.04]He'll find love one day.
[303:39.55]SpongeBob, you think so.
[303:40.73]There's no comedic timing.
[303:42.51]But it'll be with someone his own size.
[303:44.27]Pulls out a pickle like this pickle.
[303:45.97]See?
[303:46.55]They like each other.
[303:47.05]Squidward, and then Patrick bangs them together as it's a kiss.
[303:50.79]Squidward is disgusted.
[303:52.16]SpongeBob, oh, if only I knew how to work this thing.
[303:54.60]Patrick, let me take a look at it.
[303:56.54]HMMM, you know what the problem is.
[303:57.58]I'm not going to be able to get this done.
[303:59.39]Patrick, you got to set it to the MM formula when it should be set to turn ZAM around W. I'm going to have to.
[304:04.25]I got to play a different game.
[304:04.97]I don't think wombo is a real word.
[304:06.81]Patrick, come on.
[304:07.85]You know I wombo.
[304:08.45]You wombo.
[304:09.15]She, me wombo.
[304:10.39]Wombo, womboing.
[304:11.23]We'll have the wombo.
[304:11.92]Wombo, rhombo, wombology.
[304:12.84]The study of wombo.
[304:14.08]It's first grade, SpongeBob.
[304:15.12]Squidward, while Patrick is saying we'll have the wombo, I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
[304:20.10]SpongeBob, Patrick, I'm sorry.
[304:21.44]I doubted you.
[304:22.55]Patrick, well, alright, then.
[304:24.46]Let her rip.
[304:25.18]SpongeBob uses Mermaid Man's belt and presses something to try and regrow Squidward.
[304:28.78]Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk.
[304:30.10]Now it worked.
[304:31.22]SpongeBob, oh no.
[304:32.48]Patrick, look, SpongeBob's giant.
[304:34.56]SpongeBob grabs them.
[304:35.38]Can I be giant next?
[304:36.80]SpongeBob, Patrick, I'm not giant.
[304:38.38]You shrunk too.
[304:39.58]Patrick, you're kidding.
[304:40.76]Pulls out his pickle.
[304:41.42]Good thing I still got his pickle.
[304:43.08]Kisses the pickle three times.
[304:44.70]Pan over to Squidward.
[304:46.14]Squidward, they.
[304:47.20]Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?
[304:49.10]SpongeBob yells in Squidward's face, no.
[304:51.42]You can never find out, but I'll think of something.
[304:53.93]I promise.
[304:54.67]Gets a jar and puts them in.
[304:55.43]Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.
[304:57.31]Patrick, you know what's funny?
[304:58.89]My pickle started out in a jar and now it's in one again.
[305:02.13]It's like a pun or something.
[305:04.60]SpongeBob, it's only two people, no big deal.
[305:06.16]Somebody said this is giving me a stomachache.
[305:07.66]Sandy suddenly appears.
[305:09.10]Sandy, honey, SpongeBob.
[305:10.68]SpongeBob, scream Sandy.
[305:12.40]Shrinks Sandy.
[305:13.56]Sandy lands on the ground.
[305:14.44]What did you for crying out?
[305:15.25]What did you all do to me?
[305:16.53]SpongeBob, I'm sorry.
[305:17.61]Sandy.
[305:18.24]Mermaid Man came in and Larry appears.
[305:19.52]God damn it, why?
[305:20.12]Larry, they.
[305:20.78]SpongeBob.
[305:21.66]Shrinks Larry.
[305:22.82]Nat, they.
[305:23.46]SpongeBob.
[305:24.04]I shrinks Nat.
[305:25.16]Nancy, Susie, Fish.
[305:25.90]Hi.
[305:26.26]SpongeBob.
[305:27.40]Shrinks Nancy.
[305:28.04]SpongeBob screams and makes a run for it.
[305:30.06]What?
[305:30.20]It's coming out of the... SpongeBob.
[305:31.81]Shrinks Mrs. Puff.
[305:32.89]It's out of the machine.
[305:34.23]Shrinks Scooter, Sandals, and Dennis.
[305:36.33]Fish number one, they.
[305:37.39]SpongeBob.
[305:38.09]This shit's out of the machine.
[305:39.33]Fish number two, SpongeBob.
[305:40.61]Hi.
[305:41.17]Shrinks Fish.
[305:42.19]Fish number three, they.
[305:43.25]SpongeBob.
[305:44.13]Shrinks Fish.
[305:45.15]Fish number four, what's up?
[305:46.19]Sponge.
[305:46.81]Shrinks Fish.
[305:47.87]SpongeBob, tries to fit everyone in the jar, woo.
[305:50.29]I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
[305:52.03]Squidward, SpongeBob, will you just face facts?
[305:54.49]You've shrunken everybody in victory, Bob.
[305:55.51]I think it's almost done.
[305:56.53]You've got to go to Mermaid Man.
[305:58.29]SpongeBob, oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
[306:00.91]Sandy, well, you can't leave us small forever.
[306:03.20]SpongeBob, you don't understand.
[306:05.04]SpongeBob's mother is seen in the jar.
[306:06.82]Mrs. SquarePants.
[306:07.52]What do you mean it's not?
[306:08.66]It's about halfway?
[306:09.56]You need to admit your mistakes.
[306:10.76]I'm not at halfway.
[306:11.38]SpongeBob, mom.
[306:12.34]Mermaid Man, your mother's right, son.
[306:14.50]Mermaid Man will understand.
[306:15.92]Barnacle Boy, you're Mermaid Man, you old coot.
[306:18.23]Mermaid Man.
[306:18.91]Oh, yes, SpongeBob.
[306:19.73]Mermaid Man?
[306:20.81]I'm so sorry.
[306:21.43]It's just that I'm such a big fan.
[306:22.61]And your belt.
[306:23.27]And... Mermaid Man.
[306:24.67]Comforting SpongeBob.
[306:25.39]Oh, don't worry, son.
[306:27.01]I understand.
[306:27.84]SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes.
[306:29.62]Why?
[306:29.96]I remember back when I first used the belt.
[306:31.18]The year was 19-11-12.
[306:32.20]Why?
[306:32.64]I believe the president.
[306:34.02]Everyone, just tell him how to unshrink us.
[306:35.52]I need to have a different person doing this.
[306:38.56]This guy, they're all freaking me out.
[306:40.64]Let's have Rachel come in.
[306:45.27]Everyone, just tell him how to unshrink us.
[306:48.24]Mermaid man.
[306:49.16]Oh, yes.
[306:50.22]The unshrink ray.
[306:51.93]Let's see.
[306:52.69]Uh, uh, did you set it to Wumbo?
[306:55.13]Everyone.
[306:55.73]What?
[306:56.35]The jar rumbles from anger and everyone flies out of their jar.
[306:59.01]Spells out and form Get SpongeBob.
[307:00.91]Get SpongeBob.
[307:02.45]Climbs up SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head.
[307:05.55]Squidward.
[307:06.15]Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom in my own home.
[307:09.45]What?
[307:09.91]Kicks SpongeBob's stomach.
[307:11.63]Sandy.
[307:12.22]And I need an elevator to climb one stair.
[307:14.30]Why does he keep doing this?
[307:15.50]Punches his brain.
[307:17.36]Mermaid Man, we've been shrinking for years.
[307:20.30]Barnacle Boy, but this is ridiculous.
[307:23.19]Both kick his eyeballs.
[307:24.61]Dale kicks his pelvis.
[307:25.91]Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging onto his spine.
[307:28.77]Larry kicks his knee.
[307:30.49]SpongeBob is shown getting hurt from the outside.
[307:33.03]Everyone, everything's too big.
[307:35.33]SpongeBob, I've got it.
[307:36.97]Squidward saws a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone.
[307:39.81]But stop when SpongeBob shrinks the city.
[307:41.69]Tada.
[307:42.97]Everyone looks outside through his holes.
[307:44.55]Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small.
[307:47.71]It is a classic, you're right.
[307:49.38]Well, it's great to be back, SpongeBob.
[308:17.50]Is that it?
[308:21.12]That's it?
[308:21.98]That's the whole episode?
[308:29.86]That's it.
[308:30.50]Okay.
[308:31.27]It hasn't been 22 minutes, though.
[308:35.39]Hey, you guys want to watch more TV?
[308:39.61]Because I'm only at 30,000.
[308:40.67]Oh, that's right.
[308:44.82]SpongeBob episodes are 11 minutes long.

[316:58.62]Oh my god.
[316:59.44]I'm doing this one at like x10 speed.
[317:02.82]There's no way... Why would somebody do this?
[317:13.98]This one is actually going to be as fast as I can make it.
[317:22.02]I'm not suffering through this for long.
[317:23.34]Rats.
[317:23.72]Rats.
[317:24.06]We're rats.
[317:24.52]We're the rats.
[317:24.88]What?
[317:25.54]We pray at night.
[317:26.22]We stalk at night.
[317:26.84]We're the rats.
[317:27.30]No, that's not... Giant rat.
[317:28.38]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[317:30.18]Rats.
[317:30.58]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[317:32.24]That's not supposed to be... So sue me for being thorough.
[317:33.68]I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[317:37.50]Stop.
[317:37.64]Stop.
[317:53.97]I'm not going to slow this one down.
[317:57.51]Here you go.
[318:08.16]You've reached the 20 minute daily limit for voices.
[318:17.78]Oh god dammit, that means I have to do David.
[318:22.14]Hello ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode 1 of Jermacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[318:26.14]This is gonna be a single player let's play and when I say let's play I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game you're gonna see lots of fails.
[318:32.14]You're gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping.
[318:36.14]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[318:38.14]I've got apple cider right here freshly brewed, let me take a sip.
[318:41.14]Sip hop, that's good cider.
[318:42.14]Alright, so let's get this started. Create new world.
[318:45.14]World name is going to be Jermacraft. Sounds about right, eh okay.
[318:50.80]Game mode is going to be super AI survival.
[318:52.42]That's the most interesting, I think.
[318:54.46]More world option seed for world generator.
[318:55.78]Okay, this is important.
[318:57.56]I got a name.
[318:57.92]There's something crazy to get cool structures and stuff.
[319:00.60]Gonna name it UMM.
[319:01.28]How about?
[319:02.66]Diamonds are forever LOL cheese.
[319:04.88]Averga.
[319:05.28]Alright.
[319:05.76]There's that's our world generator seed.
[319:07.12]Diamonds are forever LOL cheese.
[319:08.02]B-U-R-G-A-H.
[319:08.69]Done.
[319:09.91]Alright.
[319:10.17]Let's see what happens.
[319:11.01]Create new world.
[319:11.53]Let's do it, guys.
[319:13.15]Building terrain.
[319:13.63]Oh, my God.
[319:13.95]This is so exciting.
[319:14.57]This is episode one.
[319:16.35]I wonder.
[319:16.61]I wonder where we're gonna end up.
[319:17.49]Where are we gonna end up?
[319:19.33]Okay.
[319:19.53]What?
[319:19.63]What?
[319:20.27]Where the hell am I?
[319:21.07]I spawned on top of a mountain top.
[319:23.23]Okay, hold on.
[319:24.05]Sound has to be lowered.
[319:24.97]Definitely.
[319:26.37]Okay, a little bit of that.
[319:27.63]A little bit of that.
[319:28.13]Maybe a little lower.
[319:29.75]That sounds about right.
[319:30.91]Alright.
[319:32.27]So, uh, apparently I spawned on top of a mountain.
[319:34.25]I kinda this is a good seed.
[319:36.11]What's that?
[319:36.95]We're going to explore it right now.
[319:37.93]Go.
[319:39.15]Dies from fall damage.
[319:39.83]Oh, Jermal laugh.
[319:42.11]Alright, we're going to try that again.
[319:44.21]This time I'm not gonna miss.
[319:45.05]I want to get down to DHA.
[319:45.85]That's the home right there.
[319:46.75]I want to live right there.
[319:48.48]Don, I don't even have to explore.
[319:49.74]See, if I can't do this, I gotta... Hold on, I got an idea.
[319:51.94]I got a plan.
[319:53.44]JermaCraft Episode 1.
[319:54.48]This is how we do it.
[319:56.22]You guys ready?
[319:57.26]I don't know if you... I don't know if you guys are actually really ready for this.
[320:00.40]Here we go.
[320:01.26]I'm going for a skydive.
[320:02.16]Remember, if you hold shift, you don't fall off.
[320:03.39]That's something I didn't know when I used to live stream this game.
[320:06.17]Weez, haha.
[320:07.03]You guys ready?
[320:07.77]Ready to go see our new home?
[320:09.63]Jerma laugh, alrighty then.
[320:10.35]What the hell is that?
[320:11.99]Oh, it's an octopus.
[320:12.53]Look at this quaint little place.
[320:13.37]I love it already.
[320:14.99]Haha, alrighty.
[320:17.11]So, oh Exhalation, I'm so stupid.
[320:19.27]YC I'm this is why this is why I'm an idiot guys YC, why would I I need to get wood.
[320:23.28]And I just jumped off TH okay.
[320:25.40]Remember this where are we, pointing east?
[320:27.90]I have no idea.
[320:29.52]Gotta get some trees that's the most important part of Minecraft you gotta get trees, that's the first thing you gotta get.
[320:34.18]Let me take a sip of my apple cider.
[320:36.40]Sipping sounds oh that's good stuff.
[320:38.44]Hopefully you guys picked up a thing of cocoa like I told you to because that's the most relaxing thing in the world, sitting down, playing video games doesn't get much better than that.
[320:45.15]Okay, come on now.
[320:46.47]Oh, we got sent to now explain this to me.
[320:48.53]Alright.
[320:48.81]This is an AI that created a personal email and explained to me why there are cows that are acting like mountain lions.
[320:54.76]I'm going to kill each one of those cows in just a minute.
[320:56.48]You watch all damage.
[320:58.32]Well, at least there's one tree.
[321:00.10]I got to go back that way because that's where the house is going to be my awesome dirt house.
[321:04.24]So if you are an old subscriber, I mean, really old, like at least four months or four or five months, you'll remember the original Jerma crap.
[321:10.35]It was like two episodes and I built a dirt house.
[321:13.41]This is going to be completely different.
[321:14.39]I'm going to actually spend time and make some cool stuff.
[321:16.11]At least that's what I'm pretending that I'm going to say that.
[321:18.83]Got some wood.
[321:19.27]I got Gino still.
[321:20.13]His Minecraft skin from Mario RPG.
[321:21.97]One of the best games of all time.
[321:24.06]If you have never played Mario RPG, I suggest you play it.
[321:27.08]Alright.
[321:27.62]Got some wood.
[321:28.28]I need more trees over here.
[321:29.10]I can dig up.
[321:30.60]I'll get this one too.
[321:32.26]Excruciatingly slow wood punching.
[321:34.34]One more and we'll make our way back.
[321:36.48]More wood punching.
[321:36.96]So I guess they added a hunger feature now too.
[321:38.25]If you're hungry, you die.
[321:40.37]Or something, I guess.
[321:41.77]Who knows?
[321:43.16]Even more wood, punching a little bit more wood, and in my lips screams I was always a tradition that when I played this game, I would sing a song when things got really boring.
[321:48.02]No, don't, don't sing a song.
[321:49.16]So that seems like the perfect opportunity right now to sing a song.
[321:51.34]So let me just prep my vocal cords for a second.
[321:54.02]Sips apple cider, clears throat.
[321:55.50]Okay, so we're getting wood right now, right?
[321:57.80]Ingestion, da-da, do-do, K-H, do, K-H, do, K-H, do-do-do-do-do, K-H, do, K-H, do, K-H, do.
[322:06.53]We're chopping wood down, K-H, da-da, do, K-H.
[322:10.27]Every single day.
[322:11.03]K-H.
[322:11.57]Do.
[322:11.97]K-H.
[322:12.53]Do.
[322:12.93]K-H.
[322:13.47]Do.
[322:14.71]I gotta get my tools.
[322:15.68]T-C-H.
[322:16.44]M-Do.
[322:16.88]K-H.
[322:18.24]Any which way.
[322:18.86]T-C-H.
[322:19.56]Dot-dot.
[322:20.24]K-H.
[322:20.60]Do.
[322:20.88]K-H.
[322:21.54]Do-do-do.
[322:22.94]I can't seem to reach this stupid piece of wood, so I gotta put some blocks down to get where I should.
[322:27.24]I'm gonna cop M. T-C-H.
[322:28.76]E-B-N-N.
[322:29.52]T-C-H.
[322:30.20]N-H-H.
[322:30.78]T-C-H.

[322:34.04]N-H-H.
[322:34.62]T-C-H.
[322:35.38]N-H-H.
[322:35.98]T-C-H.
[322:36.68]Doon-dot-doon-doon.
[322:37.62]TCH, Dune, TCH.
[322:40.18]I feel like I'm at an auction.
[322:42.50]Let's get the hell out of here.
[322:44.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[322:44.86]Splash, so those of you that don't think that's going to be a good spot to see.
[322:48.07]I put my paddle on.
[322:50.19]So here's the goal by Christmas time of this year, 2011.
[322:52.79]I want to have a giant castle like as big as that, uh, that mountain over there.
[322:56.61]Begins breaking blocks, so let's clean this up a little bit.
[322:58.21]2011.
[322:58.57]Why don't we, huh?
[323:00.23]Yeah, alright, alright.
[323:01.39]Maybe put a little bit of dirt down here, make sure I can, you know.
[323:04.07]D, did I really run out of dirt?
[323:06.13]Wonderful, my first wooden tools.
[323:08.21]It's just like going to your first day of school and get punched in the face by the bully.
[323:11.57]What?
[323:12.03]Speaking of bullies, I got a funny story for you.
[323:13.42]Wait, what?
[323:14.42]First ever story on Jerma craft.
[323:16.20]Wait, what?
[323:18.54]So when I was like in the fourth grade, there was a kid that lived down the street from me.
[323:21.26]His name will stay anonymous.
[323:23.28]Because you know, I don't want him to like, if he watches these videos, I don't want him to come like feed me up.
[323:27.94]Not that he would ever remember this to begin with, but I was probably like the fourth grade.
[323:31.67]Swallows.
[323:31.97]I was a little S word guys.
[323:32.81]I was a little, I was a little, little jerk when I was younger.
[323:35.45]So essentially what happened was this kid, he was a big, big fat kid.
[323:37.80]Scary. Not very nice.
[323:38.80]And my brother got in like a fight with him like a little time before this V when I was like the second grade my brother's a little bit older than me.
[323:45.00]And let me pick this up dot so my brother got in a fight with this kid and like I heard about it.
[323:46.00]And so at the bus stop one day cause we were at the same bus stop because he lives right down the street from us.
[323:54.00]At least- at least he did, I don't know if he does anymore so I don't know why I was in the fourth grade there's so much of a little jerk I was.
[323:59.00]So my grandmother used to pick me up from school after I got from the bus stop.
[324:04.40]Because you know, obviously you don't want to walk you know the mile and a half back to your house or whatever it is mile cause the bus stop wasn't that close.
[324:09.40]So my grandma used to pick me up and he was at the bus stop as well and one day I decided that out of the back window I was going to give him a double middle finger.
[324:16.00]As I was driving with my grandmother one day I don't know why I don't even know why I did it guys I can't I can't tell you one reason why-
[324:21.00]This is a real story. This is a real story. I did I actually did this.
[324:29.21]And from that day forward, I would run.
[324:31.29]Run.
[324:31.45]Yeah, I used to sprint home.
[324:32.51]And wait to the bus stop where my grandmother was going to pick me up.
[324:35.15]And it was like that for almost six months.
[324:36.69]Yeah.
[324:37.51]And he never beat me up or anything like that.
[324:38.73]He, and he, I, I, he, I, Don, I, Don, I was like overreacting.
[324:42.42]Actually, hold on a second.
[324:43.20]I don't need this.
[324:43.64]What am I doing with this?
[324:45.42]I was just putting blocks down.
[324:47.44]Actually, no, no, no.
[324:48.26]I was, I was doing the right thing.
[324:50.22]I want, I want these.
[324:51.38]Cause I want to make like a wall kind of.
[324:53.58]Let's keep that going.
[324:54.69]So yeah, so I guess the moral of the story is never give a double middle finger to a bully.
[324:57.89]Cause you'll be scared for the rest of your life.
[325:00.51]And I still am scared when I like open my doors to like go and get the groceries.
[325:03.37]I'm scared.
[325:04.83]That bully's gonna come get me for me giving him the bird.
[325:07.42]Yeah, yeah, that is actually a true story.
[325:08.54]I did not make that up.
[325:09.22]I was scared for like at least six months.
[325:11.88]And nothing ever happened either.
[325:12.94]And like, like I didn't get beat up or anything.
[325:14.48]So alright now, is there is this all is this going to go straight down into okcool.co.il?
[325:20.36]I'm gonna make a little line here.
[325:22.06]We finally give drugs to robots.
[325:23.14]I was scared for at least six months.
[325:24.12]I was scared for six months.
[325:26.06]You know, for six months.
[325:26.70]I can't get that one.
[325:27.30]You can't hurt me.
[325:27.76]I got a shovel.
[325:52.42]I'm gonna shovel your face in.
[325:54.38]Creeper explodes and takes off more than half of Jerma's health.
[325:57.22]Gasp okay well that's done.
[325:58.60]Chuckles there's not coal just right here somewhere?
[326:00.99]There has to be see this is why they always tell you, right when you start, you need to go get coal, you need to go get wood and everything.
[326:06.53]But I was too busy talking about a bully me giving him the middle finger.
[326:09.63]So looking I'm trying to see if I can see coal, sometimes it's just right on the edge of these mountains.
[326:13.87]Stares into pitch black and I am not pleased.
[326:16.25]Let's at least do this.
[326:17.41]I need a sheep too, I need wool, I'm being a real piece of crap.
[326:24.18]Is that it?
[326:26.02]That's it.
[326:29.22]Okay.
[326:34.06]Okay.
[326:36.91]Yes, I did give this random bully out the window the double middle finger for no reason.
[326:45.37]I don't know why I did it.
[326:46.33]So I was the bully.
[326:48.33]I was the one that was the mean kid.
[326:50.75]But I, you know, I flipped that story sideways.
[326:57.99]Oh yeah, the bully.
[326:59.13]The bully that I gave the finger to for no reason.
[327:04.93]Right.
[327:08.53]I only got 40, 50 tickets through this whole thing?
[327:20.42]I have 40,000.
[327:23.66]I need a break for a minute after that one.
[327:30.48]I haven't picked up a 500 in like 15 minutes.
[327:33.50]I know.
[327:33.88]I have to pay attention.
[327:40.53]Right here.
[327:44.57]And they've all... It's also been glitching out.
[327:45.87]The thing's been freaking out when I get around a green one.
[327:57.44]I need to save the... Alright, I'm going to walk out and save, you're right.
[328:00.42]That'll be a disaster.
[328:04.57]Reset the arcade?
[328:05.47]Yeah, okay, I'm going to reset the arcade.
[328:07.85]Not a bad idea.
[328:08.93]Let's reset.
[328:09.69]I need money, too.
[328:10.97]Let me just get one more 500.
[328:11.93]That should be it, right?
[328:16.44]Let me get that one.
[328:17.26]There we go.
[328:21.08]No, I'm not going to do a Seinfeld episode.
[328:29.88]I turned this all way down and it doesn't even matter.
[328:40.48]Okay.
[328:41.70]I'm going to go outside.
[328:42.60]I'm going to save the game.
[328:49.12]Save.
[328:50.86]Yes.
[328:52.90]Okay.
[328:53.28]Game has now been saved.
[328:55.86]We're good.
[328:59.21]I feel like that was on for so long, I kind of miss it being there somehow.
[329:08.38]Tingey came in with 10 community subs.
[329:10.28]Thank you, Tingey.
[329:15.59]10 more subs from Tingey.
[329:24.44]I just need to get the boombox and then... And then I win.
[329:29.26]I win the game.
[329:29.98]Just a little bit more money.
[329:42.46]Buy lottery tickets?
[329:43.38]I need ticket tickets.
[329:48.78]Nobody has JermaCraft Episode 2.
[329:51.10]Transcripted.
[329:52.20]I don't believe that.
[329:56.96]Tingy, give 10 more community subs.
[329:59.74]Thank you, Tingy.
[330:00.31]Holy shit.

[330:08.06]Well, thank you.
[330:09.66]Really appreciate it.
[330:11.40]Just play the actual episode at x2 speed.
[330:37.10]This is gonna be interesting.
[330:41.58]I should have just made one.
[330:44.32]I should have just made this one.
[330:47.21]What am I doing?
[330:48.23]Why am I doing this?
[330:48.91]Why am I going after this guy right now?
[330:50.25]What is the matter with me?
[330:51.51]See, my brain does not work in ways that you would think it should.
[330:53.35]I'm definitely gonna die.
[330:54.13]This is the stupidest idea ever.
[330:55.15]That was the dumbest thing I've ever done in this game.
[330:56.49]I don't even have a spawn point.
[330:58.07]Oh, great.
[330:59.15]At least there's cows.
[330:59.99]Mountain cows.
[331:00.49]It just feels like the robot.
[331:01.83]Whoa.
[331:02.17]Where's my diving board?
[331:03.19]Where's my diving board?
[331:04.13]I made a diving board.

[331:20.98]Everybody just blow up right now.
[331:21.64]Blow up.
[331:21.80]I want to see the hole that made.
[331:24.55]Oh, there's my diving board.
[331:25.15]Alright.
[331:26.03]That actually looks kind of cool.
[331:28.01]Did I make it?

[331:30.46]They're all here too?
[331:30.96]There's like 10 people?
[331:31.88]I don't want to- I'm not doing that.
[331:33.82]Tingy just gave 20 more community subs.
[331:35.54]Holy shit, dude.
[331:37.72]20 community subs.
[331:38.78]I'm not playing that.
[331:39.66]It's fucking with me.
[331:41.76]Thank you for the 20 more subs.
[331:44.44]It's a lot of money.
[331:46.90]But I- I ain't doing that.
[331:48.34]I can't.
[331:51.88]I'm like hearing myself as a fucking robot talking like 8 years ago.
[332:00.07]It's freaking me out.
[332:09.26]I gotta go.
[332:09.84]I gotta get out of here.
[332:13.22]Did I get it?
[332:14.14]Knock it in there.

[333:35.74]Here we go.
[333:38.84]This should be good.
[333:40.30]I'm looking forward to this one.
[333:52.87]We'll see if anybody can pick up what this one is.
[334:02.08]Did Tingey just give another 20 subs?
[334:04.22]Oh my god, Tingey.
[334:07.70]I can't get it to work, so we have to just do David.
[334:09.60]It's okay.
[334:11.02]Honest to god, the cat seriously was up in the tree.
[334:15.66]I put on swim mice, right?
[334:18.46]To try to climb the tree better, maybe there was gonna be a grip for the swim mice.
[334:24.35]And I'm shuffling up the tree, and the cat is just like me, and I swear to god.
[334:30.66]This is seriously one of the most ridiculous things to happen in my life.
[334:34.56]The cat pukes as I get right up to the cat.
[334:36.58]I'm about to save the cat stuck in the tree and the cat throws up right in.
[334:41.69]My face.
[334:43.19]And it's all like what?
[334:45.75]Oh, but I still had to hold on to the tree.
[334:48.47]So, as I'm holding on to the tree, I almost lose grip like, twice but thank god I had those swim eyes, ya know what I'm saying?
[334:58.51]Like, LOL.
[335:00.82]I finally get up right to the perch.
[335:04.22]And I have to wipe off the cat puke on my face and I go back on top and I'm sitting.
[335:08.82]The cat has moved over to the end of the branch by now so by the time the cat is sitting on the end of the branch, I'm like please don't do that, I'm trying my hardest to save you.
[335:21.09]A bird lands right on where the cat is, so the cat has now got his attention on the bird.
[335:27.34]So honest to god, it was unbelievable.
[335:31.33]So you've got a cat sitting on the itch.
[335:34.66]And you got the bird sitting there, and the cat now has the attention on the bird.
[335:40.24]So the bird is squawking at the cat at this point, and then they're moving the branch back and forth and I'm like, shaking on the branch like holy shit.
[335:49.11]Dude, like the branch is shaking.
[335:52.67]The cat is fucking screaming, the bird is screaming, and honest to god, I'm not even kidding about this.
[335:59.35]the bird just starts throwing up and I don't even know how that happened you know what I'm saying it makes no sense so the cat is on the branch and the bird has now thrown up and I'm sitting up there with my swim eyes on trying to how am I gonna I gotta save both of these animals up here you know what I mean and the fire truck like we oh oh we oh oh we oh oh it's flying down the road
[336:27.46]And I'm stuck in the tree now trying to save this bird and save this cat.
[336:31.50]And the fireman has a big megaphone.
[336:33.92]E-E-O-O-E-E-O-O.
[336:35.58]And he's like, hey, can you get down from there?
[336:39.67]Son.
[336:40.95]Like, what the heck am I gonna do about this?
[336:45.15]So they brought the trampoline over.
[336:46.89]Yeah, I know.
[336:48.97]This is crazy.
[336:51.42]So finally, long story short.
[336:54.06]the fireman starts crawling up the tree because he has to climb up the tree too.
[336:59.52]By the way, the cat is already on the ground.
[337:03.56]Cat just climbed down the tree on his own.
[337:08.04]The bird just flies away and the fireman now has to help me get down from the tree.
[337:12.98]My mother came out.
[337:14.02]It was so embarrassing.
[337:15.85]It was the most fucked up thing.
[337:18.83]It was all over the place.
[337:21.15]And finally, the fireman said, hey,
[337:23.98]at least you tried right that was the last thing at least you tried uh I just somebody wrote on on that thread this sounds like a like like trump like a trump tweet
[337:44.58]honest to god the cat was seriously up in the tree I put on swimmies right to try to climb the tree better maybe there was going to be a grip for the swimmies I'm shuffling up the tree and the cat is just like I swear to god this is seriously one of the most ridiculous things to happen in my life let me tell you something this is for real oh my fucking god I put on swimmies right to try to climb the tree better let me tell you something seriously oh my god

[338:29.91]I can't.
[338:31.59]I can't do it.
[338:32.97]Is there a Trump text to speech?
[338:39.79]No way.
[338:40.47]Is there?
[338:42.38]I think I found it.
[338:43.56]Okay, I think I found it.
[338:45.02]How much can I have here?
[338:46.10]Honest to God.
[339:00.41]This is gonna- Can I put the whole thing in here?
[339:02.49]I think I- Okay, are you ready for this shit?
[339:18.65]Come on, do it.
[339:26.93]Shit, is it too much?
[339:35.52]I think it's too much text.

[339:53.74]Is it loading the whole thing?
[339:55.14]Oh, please let me do this.
[340:01.20]You have to let me do this.
[340:02.34]This is too funny.
[340:13.43]Is it loading?
[340:19.48]I'm gonna give it a second.
[340:30.49]Yeah, alright.
[340:30.89]Let's try splitting it in half.
[340:39.28]We'll take a little bit at a time here.
[340:42.40]I need to know what this sounds like.
[340:43.48]Fuck.
[340:48.20]Less than that.
[341:00.13]Less than that?
[341:00.94]Fuck.
[341:01.76]I think you can only do like one sentence.
[341:10.90]That does not sound right.
[341:34.35]That's a YouTube foof.
[341:38.27]It really is.
[341:39.29]There's a better one?
[341:48.17]Is there a better one?
[341:54.47]Where is there a better one?
[342:07.58]Oh, wait.
[342:08.00]Are there, like, presidents?
[342:29.84]No, I can't get it.
[342:31.94]Another 20 community subs from Tingy.
[342:35.02]Holy shit, dude.
[342:39.23]Hold on.
[342:46.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[342:50.25]What is this?
[342:50.61]No, that's not it.
[342:54.43]It's not it.
[342:54.81]It's not it.
[343:00.55]Let's see.
[343:00.89]Can I... Turn your sound on.
[343:06.05]Type your message here.
[343:07.18]What is this?
[343:12.34]You can make your own text-to-speech based off your voice?
[343:15.06]Yeah.
[343:17.16]Clash?
[343:17.76]What the fuck is this?
[343:19.52]What does this do?
[343:20.18]Honest to God, the cat was seriously up in the tree.
[343:25.56]I put on swimmies, right, to try to climb the tree better.
[343:28.10]Maybe there was gonna be... The cat.
[343:32.33]Seriously?
[343:33.07]Was up in the tree.
[343:35.69]I put on swimmies.
[343:37.67]I just tried to climb the tree.
[343:43.24]What the fuck?
[343:59.89]That's too much for my brain.
[344:14.06]Um, best streamer, um, me.
[344:18.10]No, okay, let me fucking go back to the game.
[344:21.65]I can't put the whole thing.
[344:22.79]There's a character limit.
[344:27.89]I'm trying to have them say Jerma985, best streamer.
[344:35.27]Not yet.
[344:35.51]This whole thing has been derailed.
[344:36.77]Oh my god.
[344:37.72]Oh hey, more people.
[344:38.24]Might as well just run off the cliff.
[344:40.64]Shut up, Jeremy.
[344:42.28]Okay, so we're going to go back.
[344:44.63]I need like 60,000 more tickets.
[344:56.39]I'm sitting.
[344:57.53]The cat has moved over to the end of the branch by now.
[345:00.31]So by the time the cat is sitting on the end of the branch, I'm like, please don't do that.
[345:03.67]I'm trying my hardest to save you.
[345:05.17]A bird lands right where the cat is.
[345:07.07]So the cat is the attention of the bird.
[345:09.51]I'm going to fucking lose my mind.
[345:13.96]I can't even do it.
[345:14.80]It's too fucking stupid.
[345:18.82]I can do like a pretty solid five or six out of ten, Trump.
[345:22.10]I can't do it right now.
[345:23.18]It's too fucking dumb.
[345:36.72]Pay somebody, pay a Trump on Fiverr to do that.
[345:41.76]No, I don't wanna do that.
[345:57.82]Do the Peter Griffin TTS.
[345:59.68]No, I don't want Peter Griffin text-to-speech.
[346:06.72]Guys, you know how much that would cost on Fiverr?
[346:09.94]That would be like 500 bucks.
[346:14.04]That wouldn't just be $5.
[346:15.40]It's $5 for like fucking three, like five seconds.
[346:24.77]It's worth it?
[346:25.17]Okay.
[346:27.87]Okay, I'll see what I can do.
[346:47.17]I'll see what I can do.
[346:50.07]I keep syncing it right in the 18th.
[346:51.63]Alright, how many do I have?
[346:52.53]40,000?
[346:52.55]How many?
[346:54.51]How long has this stream been?
[346:55.47]Like six hours of this bullshit?
[347:02.15]Tingy has given like a million dollars.
[347:05.79]Holy shit, Tingy.
[347:08.67]That's another 20 subs from Tingy.
[347:13.91]Let me like turn this audio kind of back on a little.
[347:18.66]Whoa!
[347:20.40]That was way... Why is it so loud?
[347:28.49]Now it's so soft.
[347:41.73]Alright, that's better.
[347:45.25]I was going to hit the mega jackpot like 10 times.
[347:48.07]It would cost $100 to get a Trump on Fiverr.
[347:51.42]Yeah, I know it wasn't $5.
[347:52.12]It would be at least $1 to $2, maybe even $300.
[347:54.24]To get them to read something that's that long?
[348:02.10]Why is this all fucked up?
[348:16.05]ow alright 448 tickets when does this place close is my question because how would I be able to do this just do your own trump and read it yourself no but it's funnier if it was an actual rehearsed trump on camera
[348:45.06]Alright, was this... how much... can we get a lot in here?
[348:54.24]I feel like we can get a decent amount through Dunkel.
[349:10.71]Yeah, we're going back to the basics here.
[349:16.35]Got it.
[349:17.97]Got it.
[349:18.27]500.
[349:19.19]Oh, that's a bonus.
[349:21.83]What does a bonus do?
[349:23.27]We'll have to find out.
[349:31.43]That's three in a row.
[349:33.01]Alright, I can put more money in.
[349:36.26]I wonder what the bonus does.
[349:39.46]Give me like a 10,000.

[354:30.19]Okay, why is it doing that?
[354:36.63]I'm trying to click the ones that you guys clicked on!
[354:39.65]Oh, this whole thing's gonna fuck up, isn't it?
[354:41.17]Alright.
[354:44.11]Try it again.
[354:52.08]You clearly saw me clicking on the one on the... That was very clear.
[354:55.44]I did it twice.
[354:56.05]20 times 3 is so important here because that will probably be like 20,000 tickets.
[355:17.20]Holy shit, everybody wants to go right in the middle.
[355:19.98]Is that right in the middle?
[355:22.57]Well, it looks kind of split.
[355:24.49]It's definitely the top and the middle there, yeah.
[355:35.02]Is that in the right spot?
[355:42.79]15.
[355:45.39]Not bad.
[355:47.61]Not bad, guys.
[355:52.50]There's no more fives and we're good.
[355:58.46]There's no more fives.
[355:59.24]Ooh.
[356:13.21]32 versus 49 down the middle.
[356:19.61]This is that shitty suitcase deal show?
[356:25.10]Oh, yeah, do or don't.
[356:26.12]Alright, we're going right in the middle, underneath 15.
[356:42.63]God damn it, guys.
[356:45.35]Come on.
[356:53.28]This is x2!
[356:54.02]This shit's x2!
[356:54.54]Imagine that x3!
[356:56.64]Cards are dropping though.
[357:09.43]Alright, hold on a minute.
[357:16.85]Cards are dropping.
[357:22.63]I wonder if those are worth anything.
[357:31.71]We don't deserve to lose.
[357:35.21]Oh no, what?
[357:36.05]Oh.
[357:36.83]Okay, hold on.
[357:38.49]Uh, cards have been dropping.
[357:40.33]So hold up.
[357:45.30]We lost because of your shitty computer.
[357:48.66]That's not fair.
[357:51.60]Alright, let me see.
[357:56.56]Let me collect the stuff.
[358:00.27]My shitty computer.
[358:03.63]Hey, what if it was your computer that did it?
[358:09.27]We can do that again.
[358:21.99]Not one of these is lit up.
[358:24.29]Oh, come on.
[358:25.81]Give me the fucking dunks.
[358:31.75]I'm going to check next time to get that again.
[358:36.08]Alright, bonus.
[358:40.24]See, what's that card?
[358:42.54]See that card right there?
[358:43.36]That lawn care?
[358:44.48]What does it say?
[358:48.42]Maybe the machine has more?
[358:49.37]I'll go to the other machine after I do this one last final.
[358:53.17]I want to get whatever that card is.
[358:57.27]See?
[358:57.41]This one's dropping right here, too.
[359:02.76]What are those cards?
[359:06.58]Come on, don't go.
[359:17.60]Oh!
[359:18.26]My turn.
[359:18.82]It's my turn.
[359:19.60]It's my turn.
[359:20.28]I'm gonna do it.
[359:22.52]My turn.
[359:23.56]15.
[359:24.12]Right off the bat.
[359:24.66]7.
[359:24.68]5.
[359:25.24]7.
[359:25.34]It's not... Fuck.
[359:31.33]That's terrible.
[359:33.13]That's better than you guys, dude.
[359:58.23]Oh, re-trigger that bonus.
[360:00.19]Come on.
[360:04.15]That would have been pretty great.
[360:09.46]No, it's not bad.
[360:11.38]It was another one.
[360:12.24]It was a seven.
[360:13.82]Something just dropped.
[360:21.05]So what just fell out?
[360:22.33]What was that?
[360:23.75]What does it do?
[360:31.99]Step up this bright side.
[360:37.21]Is it tickets?
[360:47.33]Alright, we'll just... Alright, there it goes.
[360:57.68]It's probably tickets.
[360:58.80]Okay, there it goes.
[360:59.50]See?
[360:59.90]Down.
[361:00.22]Then it just disappears.
[361:02.69]Is it just turning?
[361:03.71]Maybe it's just turning into the tickets.
[361:04.92]1,361.
[361:06.92]Alright, we gotta get the D. There it is.
[361:09.22]Bonus bonus.
[361:37.32]What's the goal here?
[361:38.32]I need to get to 100,000 tickets.
[361:42.68]It was supposed to take 22 minutes, but I got too distracted by the Spongebob episode's transcript.
[361:48.28]It derailed the whole stream.
[362:01.93]Let me just try to get the bonus one more time.
[362:03.21]If you get 20 spins at times three, that's like 10,000 tickets.
[362:08.84]Or even 15.
[362:11.34]At times three.
[362:12.10]I'm still haven't gone to the UFO arcade.
[362:17.67]Didn't I try to go to the UFO door and it didn't open?
[362:20.35]I thought I tried to do that already.
[362:21.41]Did that just not happen?
[362:38.70]Almost just got an instant spin.
[362:40.08]It's pretty rare that that happens.
[362:49.07]So wait, was I... Could I... I tried to go in the UFO.
[362:51.91]Are you sure that that is currently not part of the early access or something?
[362:59.34]It eventually will have an arcade?
[363:00.54]Or is there an actual arcade in there?
[363:02.68]That I didn't see.
[363:05.02]Bonus.
[363:11.27]So let me get these two cards down, and that's it.
[363:12.84]There they go.
[363:31.01]Nice.
[363:31.37]That felt pretty good.
[363:34.74]And we already got, like, one more dunko, like, lined up here, so might as well do it.
[363:57.48]Come on.
[363:57.76]Just hit it.
[363:59.82]Hit it.
[364:00.86]Hit it.
[364:01.70]Hit it.
[364:02.06]Alright.
[364:02.72]Bonus.
[364:05.20]Alright.
[364:06.00]I tried.
[364:06.30]I tried.
[364:06.68]I tried.
[364:07.02]I tried.
[364:07.44]That's fine.
[364:12.89]I don't care about the dunko anymore.
[364:14.47]I'm just gonna put them all down here.
[364:16.73]Grab the tickets, and we're gonna go to another machine.
[364:23.90]Final push, just a few more coins, whatever.
[364:26.10]Okay.
[364:34.86]Get this pink card.
[364:35.96]Why?
[364:36.20]Is it good?
[364:40.45]I'm being serious.
[364:41.31]Like, should I get that?
[364:56.17]Alright, well let's see.
[364:57.97]What's it worth?
[364:58.45]Might as well just do another dunk up while we're here.
[365:14.90]You know, while I'm here.
[365:21.50]Push it in so I can be done with this.
[365:27.81]There it goes.
[365:28.53]Okay, I'm done.
[365:29.21]Let's see if I can get another Dunko.
[365:31.59]No, I'm out.
[365:33.33]Pick up your tickets and get the hell out of here.
[365:40.29]Why are you here?
[365:41.07]I mean, you might as well get another Dunko.
[365:50.85]What else am I gonna do, right?
[365:52.35]What else am I gonna do?
[366:02.19]Let's go for another bonus.
[366:03.23]We'll just try it.
[366:03.97]Here we go.
[366:04.35]I mean, what else?
[366:07.69]I'm up here.
[366:08.27]I might as well.
[366:10.01]Tells you.
[366:10.41]Come on.
[366:12.33]You call it a night.
[366:14.65]You can get one more, maybe, if it's possible.
[366:17.38]You could probably... It's possible to get another dunko here.
[366:19.30]It is.
[366:25.78]Well, I mean, you get two dunkos.
[366:27.48]You might as well let it ride.
[366:28.36]Alright.
[366:29.46]Go ahead.
[366:35.21]That's it.
[366:35.47]Let's capture the tickets.
[366:48.84]That's it?
[366:51.59]Didn't I get like a thousand like five times?
[366:57.05]Alright, I'm almost at 50%.
[366:57.73]That's so bad.
[366:58.19]What can I get?
[366:58.79]What's the...
[367:18.64]Got it.
[367:21.70]It's 1000.
[367:21.86]What do you mean the cards?
[367:29.02]There's no cards in the thing.
[367:36.87]There's nothing down here.
[367:39.13]They just disappeared.
[367:42.70]There's nothing in there.
[367:46.96]Nothing there, guys.
[367:49.77]What do you mean he doesn't know?
[367:50.73]Yes, I do.
[367:53.39]Hockey.
[367:55.91]That was bullshit.
[368:13.41]Fuck.
[368:13.63]The 500 probably is not that hard again.
[368:15.27]Ow, that was loud.
[368:19.16]This is 2000.
[368:19.62]Fuck.
[368:28.86]Get in there!
[368:30.36]Alright, got the E, got the H. O coming up.
[368:32.76]Next here.
[368:33.36]God, he sucks.
[368:33.84]Don't make me hiss into this microphone.
[368:56.10]One, two, three.
[368:58.63]Really?
[369:02.69]The arcade is closed because the kids are all gone.
[369:06.01]Yeah, but I greased the guy at the door.
[369:08.19]I gave him like a hundred dollar bill and he let me stay overnight.
[369:12.65]Get in there, alright.
[369:28.02]Okay, I only need the O and the K. Here comes the beep.
[369:40.37]Nope, I thought it was over.
[369:45.64]I'm getting pretty good tickets, though.
[369:47.58]200, 100, 200, 200, 300.
[369:47.84]I'm staying here.
[369:49.52]Just turn your monitor off.
[369:50.90]So you don't have to... Turn your monitor off and turn your sound off.
[369:53.90]So you don't have to listen to this.
[370:04.68]Yeah, there's the K. Let's try to get, was it 500?
[370:06.55]Where's the 500?
[370:07.75]There's the K, got it.
[370:09.05]Fuck.
[370:24.95]There it is.
[370:25.97]Oh, it's a beautiful day.
[370:30.90]Just give me the K. It's already going around.
[370:37.94]Go around.
[370:41.34]Oh my god, I missed it.
[370:42.42]It's okay, I got another hundo.
[370:45.98]I actually think this is pretty efficient, because eventually you'll get 2,000.
[370:54.40]You know what I'm saying?
[370:55.56]Like, I'm getting 500, 800, 400, 500 every time.
[370:57.92]And then you will get 2,000.
[371:00.62]If you sit here long enough.
[371:05.93]I fuck it up every damn time.
[371:12.65]The claw machine's the best.
[371:14.13]I sat there for like 40 minutes.
[371:17.08]I need to do a different game that's not the balloons.
[371:26.45]It is really loud.
[371:27.69]I know it is.
[371:30.05]Oh my god, I fucking missed it again.
[371:40.24]Just put some shit in there.
[371:43.20]Do the chicken again.
[371:46.15]Don't tell me to go do the chicken again.
[371:54.27]I don't know what it is about this K, but I cannot fucking get it.
[371:58.47]It's pissing me off more than anything.
[372:11.97]America runs on Dunko.
[372:15.61]Yes, it does.
[372:17.99]Fuck it!
[372:24.70]Where's the 500?
[372:28.47]Right here.
[372:28.99]500!
[372:29.11]Oh, I'll get him on the way around.
[372:39.55]I just teleported.
[372:40.57]That was bullshit.
[372:42.19]I just teleported.
[372:42.87]Alright, I'll take the 2120.
[372:45.54]Let's go.
[372:48.36]Cashman.
[372:52.97]I think that's a solid 5 or 8%.
[372:56.54]We're at 50%.
[372:56.76]Now I'm going to do the boring ball game.
[373:06.37]No, I'm not.
[373:06.59]I'm going to do this.
[373:07.03]Do this until I don't do it.
[373:25.47]Got it.
[373:27.81]Oh, I actually really did get it.
[373:38.48]I really did.
[373:39.45]I really did.
[373:40.27]I don't think she likes iPods in these.
[373:46.01]It's going to be close.
[373:58.77]This one's also way too expensive.
[374:00.43]I don't want to do the money machine thing again.
[374:09.76]There it is.
[374:12.22]Alright, that was perfect.
[374:13.60]I refuse to play this again.
[374:20.35]I tried to get out, but the screen didn't even pop up for me.
[374:46.77]Alright, here we go.
[374:47.71]Here I am.
[374:48.45]Let's go.
[374:49.11]Pick up the ticket balls.
[375:01.22]This one's broken.
[375:03.71]It used to work really well.
[375:16.68]I need to get 100, 500 balls.
[375:20.84]Do you understand the thing that you are telling me that I need to do and how I don't want to do it?
[375:46.40]Stop spinning around so much.
[375:49.49]No SpongeBob.
[375:52.83]No, there's only a certain amount of SpongeBob that I'm allowed to take.
[375:56.31]17 hour stream?
[375:59.61]No, I'll get there quicker than that.
[376:10.24]I think Dunko might be a better bet.
[376:13.76]I really do.
[376:17.33]I just got an achievement for getting 50,000 tickets.
[376:19.45]Alright, I'm going to, I'll get, let's do this 20 more times.
[376:49.13]Yeah, back to the claw.
[376:51.83]And then sometimes the claw just doesn't work.
[376:56.09]I'm a chicken wheel.
[376:57.53]That's a good idea, too.
[377:06.44]What was the minor prize for the blocks game again?
[377:08.90]Was it a thousand?
[377:12.18]It was, wasn't it?
[377:17.73]It was 100.
[377:18.01]Oh, that's not worth it.
[377:24.80]Go back to the water gun game.
[377:27.58]No, the water gun game doesn't give... It gives credits.
[377:30.98]It doesn't give tickets.
[377:42.73]What time is it right now?
[377:45.61]I've had like two streams, or three streams restart because of the internet being weird earlier.
[377:51.97]This is four and a half hours, then two hours.
[377:54.98]How long has this stream actually been?
[378:01.92]That's next level play right there, and it didn't even go in.
[378:04.48]It just teleported back to the... That's absolute dog shit.
[378:12.70]It's been about seven hours.
[378:18.78]Well, it's kept my attention for seven hours somehow.
[378:22.12]I don't know, it's just like fun to do these things.
[378:26.04]Alright, I'm going to check it.
[378:27.22]I'm going to go after one more ball and I'm going to go to check again.
[378:36.65]There we go, come on, get it in there.
[378:43.59]Does that even- is it counting?
[378:46.59]I don't think that's fucking counting.
[379:00.88]52%.
[379:00.92]Now we're almost there.
[379:03.26]We're mostly there now.
[379:04.64]Don't you understand?
[379:15.85]No, that's just cuckoo coins.
[379:28.00]Bonus shot.
[379:28.64]Hit the... So if you do twice in a row, you get 2,500.
[379:30.64]That's... All the way up there is too hard.
[379:54.89]This one sucks.
[379:56.63]It's fun to play, but it's bad.
[379:58.91]It's not going to get us another 48,000 tokens.
[380:00.55]Is it 2,500 or 75?
[380:01.13]It's definitely 25.
[380:04.07]What?
[380:25.76]Well, just go for red.
[380:28.02]How many times would I have to do that if I just landed on red?
[380:39.03]500 times.
[380:39.61]500 more times.
[380:51.31]The ball drop game is actually pretty good.
[380:53.08]It's pretty consistent too.
[381:01.69]Alright, I'm gonna do this... I'm not gonna do this again.
[381:06.46]I'm not gonna put everybody through this a second time.
[381:10.32]I'm gonna get like three or four hundred more tickets from this game.
[381:20.95]There's always that chance that I get... Alright, here we go.
[381:22.95]This is the shot right here.
[381:28.53]I'll take a hundred.
[381:29.03]It's alright.
[381:29.85]That's about... I'm looking at like two or three more of these.
[381:38.86]Get it!
[381:40.42]Oh, what?
[381:42.70]That would have been 2,500.
[381:51.72]Too much.
[381:56.89]I would have had it too.
[382:02.61]alright so let's play a game called there's 42 4 300 people here right now right so what we're gonna do is some people are probably coming back uh you know trickling back trickling in leaving coming back after a while we're going to pretend that I've been here the whole time so
[382:24.46]I want everybody in chat right now for like the next five minutes to just to just be talking about stop playing this dude you've been here for like fucking six hours it's not funny anymore and shit like that and then we're gonna have like an argument okay ready someone's bound to come back in like after like five minutes of this I can I know I can do it though like I I'm seriously I've done it so many times
[383:01.03]I know, I know, I know.
[383:03.27]You think you're frustrated about it?
[383:04.71]I'm fucking frustrated too.
[383:07.73]This is incredibly fucking frustrating, if you don't understand.
[383:10.15]How, like, you don't think I fucking feel bad about this?
[383:12.29]Like, trying to stay here for this long?
[383:15.13]This sucks, and I fucking have to do this, otherwise I'm never gonna hear the end of this.
[383:19.44]Oh my fucking god.
[383:25.18]Stop, stop, stop!
[383:26.50]Can we clear the chat or something, please?
[383:28.06]Because, like, this is actually fucking annoying.
[383:39.03]Come on.
[383:43.65]Look, people have sat and played a game for long enough.
[383:47.13]People have sat and played a game for like fucking 10 hours straight on the same thing.
[383:50.42]So what's the difference?
[383:52.24]People play like Fortnite and shit for like fucking 10 hours straight.
[383:54.70]What's the problem?
[384:02.97]God damn it, that was a...

[392:18.02]I'm gonna unban them.
[392:20.64]I banned- somebody got like caught in the crossfire there.
[392:23.10]I banned somebody because they were talking about like their favorite fucking TV show and I just didn't want to fucking even listen to them.
[392:29.05]So I just didn't want any other conversation.
[392:38.03]I gotta replace my fucking wall.
[392:45.26]I really I and this is going to be spread and I said I I said a lot of bad stuff and I want to make sure that I did before I'm going to get in front of this um sorry for making fun of all the people that were here sorry for talking I threatened to quit streaming I think like 10 to 15 times I'm really sorry
[393:17.68]Alright, let me actually get out of this.

[394:16.12]It's been five hours.
[394:17.36]Alright, now here's the worst part about that.
[394:22.64]I did that- that went up- went on for long enough.
[394:25.50]Where at least probably a hundred people came and probably will never come back.
[394:36.38]So, uh... What am I gonna do, right?
[394:40.14]It was for the art.
[394:46.37]Imagine, like, Kim or, like, Etalyx had opened the stream.
[394:50.05]Like, oh, let's check on the stream.
[394:52.17]And that's what they hear.
[394:53.01]I'm going to go downstairs and Kim's going to be like, are you, like, done streaming forever or what's going on here?
[395:17.06]Alright, don't go!
[395:19.86]How many tickets do I have?
[395:22.98]Fifty-four thou- Oh, God.
[395:25.04]Okay, I gotta fucking just get this going.
[395:31.92]Okay, somebody do the math.
[395:35.87]If I get one 500 balloon per minute, how many minutes will it take for me to get to 50,000?
[395:44.20]If I get two, if I get a thousand tickets a minute.
[396:00.03]It's over an hour.
[396:00.92]God damn it.
[396:02.96]Alright.
[396:03.18]What if I do a thousand, a thousand tickets a minute is 50 minutes.
[396:12.85]What about 1,500 tickets a minute?
[396:22.61]I can do that.
[396:23.11]I can handle that.
[396:31.74]30 minutes?
[396:32.46]That's not that bad.
[396:35.00]No, that's not that bad at all.
[396:36.46]That's not a big deal.
[396:42.77]Alright, we're about 3,000 tickets a minute.
[396:52.92]I only have six dollars.
[396:53.99]It's okay.
[396:54.33]I can go in the other room and get money immediately.
[397:15.61]100,000 tickets a minute and you'll be there.
[397:17.21]Well, um, hold on.
[397:18.03]I gotta, one step at a time.
[397:22.61]In before I blackout and save loss.
[397:25.67]I'm not gonna, my power is not gonna turn off.
[397:28.47]Although, wait a minute.
[397:31.25]Have I paid the bill?
[398:03.80]56,000.
[398:03.94]It's so close.
[398:06.94]I'm gonna say a little bit of dunko.
[398:10.12]One round of dunko and then we're gonna get money.
[398:14.91]I need some gamer fuel.
[398:18.88]What, like almonds?
[398:20.06]Because that's all... That's... Just eat a few almonds.
[398:29.37]Just eat fucking ten almonds.
[398:39.33]Or eat... Just like three or four spoons of peanut butter.
[398:55.90]You don't need any fuel.
[398:57.66]I'm gonna get all these cards.
[399:02.36]Where's cash?
[399:11.17]Oh, I got plenty of cash.
[399:15.01]Jerma's the guy that hands out apples on Halloween?
[399:16.93]No, I hand out the king size on Halloween.
[399:21.96]That's right.
[399:30.53]King-size apples.
[399:41.78]I hand out streamer business cards on Halloween.
[399:44.90]I know I do not do that.
[399:50.14]Come on, give me a dunko!

[401:34.81]I'm the guy on Twitch that gets, like, the jackpots.
[401:38.43]My TwitchCon card would be, like, sevens.
[401:43.01]And then it'd be me with, like, dice in my hand.
[401:47.73]And it'd be, like, a bubble over my mouth.
[401:49.45]It'd be like, Viva Las Vegas!
[401:53.24]And I'd hand out three of them.
[401:59.44]The other, like, 6,000 that got printed would get, like, shredded.

[409:09.51]You know, here's the thing.
[409:15.92]I'm never gonna have to play any of these ever again in the arcade.
[409:19.50]I am getting my total fill from these games that I will walk right by them.
[409:24.37]I don't have to go to the arcade again.
[409:29.67]I've seen this machine in a dozen arcades.
[409:34.17]I don't even need to play it.
[409:35.61]Who fucking cares?
[409:36.39]I already did it like 50 times.
[409:43.59]Show me up.
[409:57.88]Yeah.

[410:15.07]I still, I got like 23,000.
[410:16.57]Last one and then I'm going to go back over to, I don't know.
[410:18.97]I need that in the bass.
[410:20.51]I'll get 1,000 in the bass and win.
[410:39.12]basketball doesn't give tickets this is absolutely the worst time I'll settle for 100. uh
[411:15.06]This is the worst machine in any arcade.
[411:19.59]Now riddle me this.
[411:20.89]Why are these machines always full of people?
[411:26.21]There is always somebody playing one of these.
[411:28.47]There's usually five of them lined up and every single one of them has a person on it.
[411:39.07]Low skill, high reward.
[411:40.59]No, it's low skill, low reward.
[411:42.41]You get like 10 tickets every time and it's like four bucks.
[411:50.48]This is the worst machine in the... Okay, I don't talk about companies.
[411:58.17]Come on.
[412:14.65]That person scared me.
[412:18.25]I'm in my own world so much that this person scared the shit out of me.
[412:24.26]Ah, it's a person!
[412:25.06]No, statistically speaking, there's no way I'm gonna play it that way.
[412:33.10]It's not gonna happen.
[412:43.50]Guys, it's not.
[412:47.92]There's nothing to this.
[412:50.93]Besides, land on 1% of the whole wheel.
[413:00.94]If I don't get this, you're going to unsell.
[413:03.64]What if I do get this?
[413:11.18]Should I prices right this and try to get it on the 1000 and do like a one tiny little spin?
[413:20.99]Let's try this.
[413:21.59]Let's try doing the prices right technique.
[413:35.19]Here we go.
[413:43.55]It's gonna work.
[413:44.71]I'm gonna get there.
[413:49.92]And then I'm going to farm 1,000 tickets.
[413:53.14]Stop.
[413:53.60]Stop, stop, stop.
[414:15.05]It's so diabolical.
[414:17.35]I love it.
[414:17.89]25.
[414:18.47]I'll get there.
[414:57.84]Slowly but surely, yeah.
[414:59.04]What do you mean, zero tickets?
[415:08.00]Oh, fuck.
[415:24.09]And it actually went over it.
[415:29.70]come on man you have to go one space alright I understand so you have to at least go over one square so as long as I get to the yeah it was landing on the same one
[415:58.44]It was actually working then, yeah.
[416:00.66]Make sure the tickets are actually coming out.
[416:08.52]Give me the 100.
[416:08.80]100!
[416:08.82]Will it still count as 100 if I get on the 100?
[416:12.61]No.
[416:26.68]I don't think so.
[416:31.40]Let me at least hit it just so I can go to sleep tonight.
[416:35.58]Oh, come on.
[416:37.68]Evil Fish just gave five community subs.
[416:39.30]Thank you, Evil Fish.

[417:00.90]Oh, 100 tickets now.
[417:06.17]Can I do it again?
[417:06.95]No.
[417:07.59]I can do it.
[417:07.97]I can get 2,000.
[417:08.49]It actually would have worked.
[417:12.03]Alright.
[417:13.21]Now we know it works.
[417:20.63]I got to go a little faster than that.
[417:30.80]That actually did give me the four still.
[417:32.90]Alright, it's coming up here, right?
[417:38.78]Wait, is it the next one?
[417:39.48]When is it?
[417:44.57]It's still less efficient than the ball drop.
[417:46.15]No, I know, but I have to beat this.
[417:49.91]I have to get a thousand to come out of the machine.
[417:52.49]Therefore, I can say that I completed it.
[418:04.43]here it comes okay stop alright little pushes somebody said if you land on a thousand and then do a full pull it'll land on a thousand no it won't
[418:35.50]Is that real?
[418:38.04]So get to 1,000 and then land, do full speed.
[418:40.71]I can just do it over and over again.
[418:44.85]What do I have to lose?
[418:45.73]You're right.
[418:50.91]Why do you read chat comments like a radio host?
[418:55.33]Because that's what this is.
[419:00.81]I'm...
[419:06.52]How is this any different?
[419:07.70]This is a radio show.
[419:10.70]Why would I not read the comments?
[419:25.57]You want me to just look over and go...
[419:36.14]Nice dude.
[419:38.64]And that- and that's what I deserve for fucking- oh my god.
[419:58.12]Oh.
[420:00.34]That's a funny thing you said.
[420:07.01]Do it all, land on it organically, come on.
[420:28.98]Alright, we're back there again.
[420:36.02]Do that one more time, and then here it is.
[420:37.66]Alright.
[420:38.08]Okay.
[420:39.44]Alright.
[420:51.76]Fuck.
[420:52.18]Okay.
[420:52.68]I...
[421:03.89]Yeah, you have to do it so light.
[421:05.25]I'm going to turn the audio off.
[421:12.63]It's freaking me out.
[421:13.73]I just pulled my headphones off.
[421:24.11]Because there's no way.
[421:25.35]I can't.
[421:25.69]That...
[421:57.46]What a sad person.
[422:04.98]How much money is that old guy spent on the machine?
[422:07.40]I don't know, at least $400.
[422:10.92]I'm just leaning back in the chair.
[422:22.57]I pulled up a chair by this point.
[422:31.57]It's still ringing in my head.
[422:32.91]Yeah, like this.
[422:35.04]I almost accidentally pressed it a tenth of a percent harder.
[423:00.03]Almost there.
[423:01.85]Hey, thank you Demons V for the five community subs.
[423:04.12]Thanks a lot.
[423:08.22]That's my new sub sound.
[423:11.46]Thank you for the... That's my new community sub sound.
[423:13.86]Appreciate it.
[423:15.02]Hope you guys like it.
[423:21.80]Every time I get a community sub, that song will play.
[423:30.72]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[423:39.76]That's a sneaky way of asking for subs.
[423:43.98]Hey!
[423:44.70]Look at that!
[423:49.68]Is it sneaky or is it just like completely and totally like just out there?
[424:04.41]I'm not gonna make that the sub zone.
[424:05.78]No way.
[424:13.26]This hurts so much to watch.
[424:22.26]It won't be in a minute, I promise.
[424:25.21]We're almost there.
[424:26.07]It's almost done.
[424:28.31]And then I'm going to get another thousand and I'm going to full blast it.
[424:35.18]Speaking of sub sounds, are they actually basically dead?
[424:38.40]Kind of.
[424:40.28]Kind of.
[424:53.49]Alright, here we go.
[424:56.20]What's happening?
[424:57.28]Okay, ready?
[425:02.22]Two more of those, I think.
[425:20.44]You're freaking me out.
[425:21.48]No, um... There's no overshoot joke.
[425:24.65]You're freaking me out.
[425:26.63]Stop freaking me out.
[425:38.67]Fuck.
[425:57.28]Yes.
[425:58.48]A thousand tickets!
[426:09.15]Alright, so they said do a full blast.
[426:11.95]From here?
[426:12.41]You lied.
[426:16.73]Well, you lied.
[426:33.54]Not full.
[426:41.14]What do you mean?
[426:42.66]I held it down.
[426:51.96]I actually held it down.
[426:52.86]I swear to god.
[427:00.64]stop alright I'm up I was trying to get it just trying to hit it one more time oh sometimes you gotta try
[427:27.62]Oh, where am I?
[427:29.08]Let's see.
[427:29.44]61,000.
[427:29.50]Alright, back to...
[428:19.12]I can do this.
[428:19.70]Let me hit this at least one more time.
[428:29.25]I think that's pretty good.
[428:31.49]No, no, no.
[428:32.79]It was.
[428:33.23]It looked alright.
[428:39.88]It's alright.
[428:43.59]The treasure game?
[428:44.37]I'll try it.
[428:44.87]I don't understand how this works.
[428:50.37]You joystick to move an arm and knock off coins.
[428:53.92]Don't touch the shovel.
[428:56.04]I can't even read.
[428:57.42]There's a thousand tickets if you get to what?
[429:24.17]I've knocked all the shit off.
[429:35.05]The sound?
[429:36.17]Yeah, I'm going to turn this way down.
[429:37.61]This is obnoxious.
[429:43.82]I'm still not getting it.
[429:46.54]Do I have to get all the coins knocked off?
[429:52.84]I still don't get it.
[430:16.06]The coins have to go forward?
[430:17.88]Is that what it is?
[430:22.01]The front doesn't count.
[430:24.51]I thought the front is the thing that counts.
[430:28.81]Does anybody get what the hell this is actually going on here?
[431:05.94]I mean, damn man, like how the fuck are you supposed to do this?
[431:16.71]Front doesn't count.
[431:31.49]How did I only get five coins?
[431:33.30]Oh.
[431:50.50]Now, those are definitely counting.
[431:59.14]Go left and right.
[432:02.64]Starting in the middle is a bad strategy.
[432:05.24]You're talking about just, like, sweep left and right.
[432:08.09]Let's try this.
[432:08.65]Let's try just sweeping up here, like, going like this.
[432:16.57]That's too thin.
[432:42.40]This one's stupid.
[432:44.32]That's what I was thinking.
[432:56.60]I was thinking of going around like a swirl like this.
[432:58.72]This probably is the way you're supposed to do it.
[433:25.66]Just break the glass.
[433:26.46]I need to figure this out.
[433:28.02]How the hell are you supposed to do it?
[433:33.91]Try doing a square around the perimeter?
[433:49.47]Not a bad idea so far.
[433:59.83]It's just hard to grab them all.
[434:01.41]Especially because you can't... Um... I really hope this is not in any arcades because I feel bad for the company that made it because no one plays it.
[434:14.00]You know?
[434:16.14]I just... I do.
[434:46.63]Get the treasure off!
[434:48.57]I can't even go back far enough to get it!
[435:01.46]I'm not done.
[435:02.64]Let me try one more time.
[435:04.01]I'm just gonna go back and then forward with all the big chunk parts.
[435:17.24]Like that.
[435:18.26]Okay.
[435:18.62]There's not enough time to do this.
[435:34.84]I even knocked off all the treasure chests.
[435:39.65]What the fuck?
[435:47.09]I'm off doing it.
[435:47.55]This is the last one.
[435:48.13]I'm gonna try like an undulating technique.
[436:17.81]That might actually work.
[436:18.91]That might actually work.
[437:01.96]What the fuck?
[437:02.82]That was fucking perfect.
[437:04.63]Ooh.
[437:05.23]Alright.
[437:05.55]That's 100.
[437:05.79]How many do you need?
[437:07.05]I'm gonna try that again.
[437:35.69]Yeah, that was... That was... Why was it 50 tickets?
[437:40.64]Alright, last... This one's dumb.
[437:42.34]Who cares?
[437:42.76]I don't need to get the thousand.
[437:45.18]Thousand.
[437:53.19]That's a pretty good push right there.
[437:54.71]That was a lot.
[438:07.25]Pretty good.
[438:07.73]Push again!
[438:15.29]Come on, man.
[438:16.49]What?
[438:21.61]Alright, come on.
[438:24.85]Last one.
[438:25.55]That's it.
[438:27.27]I'm going right down the middle.
[438:31.28]Check this out.
[438:31.94]Right down the middle on this side.
[438:33.02]Right down the middle on the other side.
[438:39.29]I fucked it up.
[438:39.91]The game's like lagged.
[438:40.95]Did you see that shit?
[438:49.59]Whatever.
[438:49.97]The game's lagged.
[438:53.37]I need another attempt without the lag.
[439:08.18]That was clean.
[439:27.59]I was just threw up.
[439:30.92]Why can I move the mouse in here?
[439:32.94]Why can I move this?
[439:39.38]Just lock me in!
[440:09.99]I'm just out.
[440:10.63]I'm out.
[440:10.89]This one's dumb.
[440:17.14]What happened there?
[440:17.76]That was so different.
[440:21.08]Are we doing the skit again?
[440:23.10]Yeah.
[440:24.04]Yeah, man.
[440:24.52]This is the skit again.
[440:26.73]This is the joke again.
[440:28.31]That's what I'm doing here.
[440:49.84]Now that thing is stuck back there.
[440:51.24]This game isn't even real, because if it was real, it would suck.
[441:38.62]That's a pretty good attempt right there.
[441:40.62]Give me a hundred.
[441:41.48]A hundred.
[442:00.41]Whatever.
[442:00.91]I'm pissed right now.
[442:10.32]I just threw this one away.
[442:11.38]Just get it out.
[442:16.79]I don't want to play this one anymore.
[442:19.27]Where's like the put foot through glass button?
[442:23.67]This game's stupid.
[442:25.19]Dumb.
[442:42.46]The game eats ass.
[442:48.18]I have one cent?
[442:49.66]Right.
[443:06.34]Buy the bat at the prize counter.
[443:09.58]Look at the- I'm so close!
[443:22.63]Why did I move from the spot?
[443:30.47]This has been a very long birthday party.
[443:39.61]Excuse me, please move.
[443:40.53]Why don't you get in there?
[443:44.81]They always do the same thing.
[443:46.15]They always stick themselves into the door.
[443:49.19]Alright, I need some efficiency here.
[444:01.48]Uh, there's five community subs from an anonymous gifter.
[444:04.50]Thank you, whoever you are.
[444:08.57]Thank you for your five community subs.
[444:13.63]500, good.
[444:14.01]Alright, we're good.
[444:14.67]Here we go.
[444:15.09]Go, go, go.
[444:18.33]This one's pretty consistent, I think.
[444:19.87]I'll be alright.
[444:22.75]700 tickets.
[444:23.17]I'm staying here.
[444:23.73]There's the K. Okay.
[444:32.52]Just give me the Y, the O, the C. There you go.
[444:42.45]Another 100.
[444:42.79]Here comes the C. Bingo.
[444:48.55]Almost.
[444:48.79]It's alright.
[444:52.17]I get at least 300 to 400 tickets every single time I play this.
[444:56.63]And then you... I'm gonna be good.
[445:00.63]That was bullshit.
[445:05.17]He's still on the hockey game after this much time.
[445:08.60]Time!
[445:09.32]Guys, I don't think I'm going to get to the 100,000 tickets.
[445:19.75]I'm already kind of failing right now.
[445:23.15]My brain is starting to fail.
[445:41.37]Just grind out some green balls.
[445:43.67]I will after this.
[445:48.11]Oh my god.
[445:48.97]Thanks for watching, though.
[445:54.64]Thanks for sticking around.
[445:56.10]Hope you had fun.
[445:59.04]We're gonna have a ton of fun when I get that boombox.
[446:05.67]It happened again.
[446:06.25]I can't believe it.
[446:10.88]Okay, why did it teleport over there?
[446:24.84]Give me the O. Where's the 500?
[446:28.56]Right here?
[446:32.56]There we go.
[446:33.25]Come on now.
[446:34.45]Give me the O. Stick it in there.
[446:41.60]Hockey.
[446:51.58]Can somebody else play this right now for me?
[446:53.00]Can somebody else play?
[446:54.82]Can I just watch?
[447:00.34]Why does it have to be so quiet?
[447:05.59]Fuck.
[447:13.83]That's like a person.
[447:14.87]That person just like fucking couldn't take it anymore and threw up in their mouth.
[447:21.33]Can somebody else take over for a minute?
[447:22.89]I just need a minute.
[447:27.42]Where's the O?
[447:37.64]I miss it every fucking time.
[447:39.62]Alright.
[447:47.04]One, two, now.
[447:58.91]Give me the 500, I want that instead.
[448:06.91]Hey, he's a better shot than the Bruins.
[448:11.13]Remember that one from earlier today?
[448:12.95]I remember that one.
[448:14.55]2,000 tickets!
[448:22.64]250.
[448:26.52]Oh, this is when it just goes absolutely haywire.
[448:31.26]Oh, he's going to get a ball.
[448:40.54]Let's go.
[448:42.46]Why am I so excited about this?
[448:48.46]I got fucked over there.
[449:01.45]I'll take 140.
[449:02.33]Let me get the 2000 one more time.
[449:03.95]This is reliable for me.
[449:13.95]Double.
[449:16.01]Give me the C. C and the Y. Nice, the C. You gotta do it so early.
[449:31.93]I mean, I was close.
[449:33.35]I saw the opportunity for the 250 and I had to try to take it.
[449:55.02]I'm just seeing some opportunities that I have to try.
[450:04.88]Mistake.
[450:14.29]Nephew, I'll just buy you a boombox.
[450:33.98]Yeah, I'll just buy you a boombox.
[450:37.16]Please stop going through my pension money.
[450:44.03]Well, that's the title of the stream.
[450:45.87]That's why the stream is that title.
[450:47.99]For you to get any interesting item from any of these arcades, you are talking about thousands of dollars of game time.
[450:56.84]A PS4 is fucking 300 bucks.
[451:01.48]Just buy the PS4.
[451:06.31]Give me the Y. Fuck.
[451:13.65]I've spent over a thousand... Yeah, I have to have spent over at least one to two thousand dollars in this arcade.
[451:23.84]That thing keeps screwing me over.
[451:25.20]The little switchblade on the left.
[451:27.89]I saw an opportunity.
[451:28.57]I had to go for it.
[451:29.33]Oh, well.
[451:39.57]Alright, I'm gonna do this a couple more times I'm seeing opportunities left and right Another opportunity Oh, that's 500
[452:05.13]Play the coin game OST?
[452:07.96]What are you talking about?
[452:15.28]So, I'm addicted?
[452:16.10]I'm addicted?
[452:16.76]Yes.
[452:17.22]I'm addicted to getting... 100,000 tickets.
[452:20.34]Okay.
[452:33.64]Let's do a little... Okay, hold on.
[452:35.14]I need to cash out.
[452:36.60]No, not yet.
[452:39.28]Saw an opportunity.
[452:56.69]Alright, 620.
[452:57.05]I am... You're going to be very surprised with almost the 10,000 tickets I have right here.
[453:13.70]Come on, get that 500 in there.
[453:30.07]The letters are in really, really bad places right now.
[453:35.55]Fuck.
[453:38.77]Check to see how much money you've spent.
[453:40.35]It's in the last tab.
[453:41.77]Yeah, I will.
[453:44.06]We'll see.
[453:44.38]We'll take... What do you guys think?
[453:45.38]Place your bets.
[453:47.38]I saw an opportunity and I took it.
[453:48.54]Alright, let's go.
[453:52.82]Let's find out.
[453:53.24]Let's find out.
[453:53.62]Let me get these tickets.
[454:05.20]That's a lot.
[454:15.77]I'm thinking the hockey machine is the most reliable.
[454:17.85]We're almost there.
[454:20.05]It is.
[454:22.76]No, I'm not gonna check that tab yet.
[454:24.04]I wanna see how long the journey was.
[454:31.16]Let me get there first.
[454:44.89]Alright, those are in a decent spot.
[454:48.49]Ball drop is faster?
[454:49.57]What do you mean, ball drop?
[454:55.18]Ball drop is crying.
[454:56.12]What are you talking about?
[455:03.24]Which ball drop?
[455:04.02]You mean mega jackpot ball drop?
[455:05.66]Or do you mean, like, red ball drop?
[455:16.76]Red ball drop?
[455:18.54]I disagree.
[455:19.14]I don't think red ball drop is faster.
[455:24.35]Let me get one more, like, good run on this one, and then we'll go over to Mega Jackpot.
[455:32.57]There's the Y. Okay, that 500 will go in.
[455:42.90]Need the C.
[455:45.49]There it is.
[455:46.35]Alright, let's get the 500 too.
[455:51.62]Oh!
[455:53.06]Getting pretty good.
[455:53.80]2,000.
[455:53.82]Alright.
[456:02.93]Let me get some more 500s.
[456:18.22]There it is.
[456:20.53]A few more of those and we'd be good to go.
[456:28.39]Damn it.
[456:28.99]That's standing up right now.
[456:30.03]Is that going to be a problem for me?
[456:31.27]Is that going to be a problem for me?
[456:33.52]Nah.
[456:43.28]Get in there.
[456:50.19]You didn't play the chicken version.
[456:51.83]Um, we have a few times.
[456:56.57]Damn it.
[457:01.91]Hold up, there's a lot.
[457:03.28]There's like two 250s in there.
[457:09.64]Damn it!
[457:11.80]Ugh.
[457:13.74]Damn it!
[457:15.10]I'm losing it.
[457:16.32]I can see the end of the tunnel.
[457:21.39]I can see the end of the tunnel and I'm running out of gas in my car.
[457:37.48]Get in there!
[457:43.66]Get the fuck in there!
[457:50.51]I need someone else to play this.
[457:53.83]I need someone else to play this.
[457:55.99]I'm getting tunnel vision.
[457:56.97]My only view is like a four inch diameter around my eyes.
[458:00.95]I can't see anything.
[458:08.53]There we go.
[458:09.63]I can see again.
[458:12.85]There are two 500s.
[458:15.13]I need to get those.
[458:22.79]There's one.
[458:23.93]I gotta get that other one too.
[458:26.25]Guys, this is going fine.
[458:35.84]There's that other 500.
[458:37.86]It'll come around again.
[458:38.58]I need the E, the H, and the O. Ah.
[458:53.29]E-H-O, E-H-O, E-H-O.
[459:05.59]I'll take it.
[459:06.07]That's a lot.
[459:15.29]What's that 500?
[459:17.25]Buried over here somewhere.
[459:20.44]There it is.
[459:21.22]No.
[459:22.04]No.
[459:22.48]Oh, there it is.
[459:23.02]Come here.
[459:23.44]Come here.
[459:28.04]The H. And the E. What a fucking blunder.
[459:50.22]Damn it.
[459:54.46]It's... I have to finish it, you know?
[459:57.42]You know when you start something... You just have to finish it.
[460:08.51]Get in there.
[460:10.01]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[460:15.00]This is 250.
[460:15.24]At least it's 250.
[460:29.51]H and E. Forget about the 500s.
[460:32.93]Oh, you motherfucker.
[460:43.48]Oh, you double motherfucker.
[460:52.59]Where's the E?
[461:06.56]Alright, now I'm gonna get the 500s.
[461:08.28]I'm gonna clear the 500s and I'm out.
[461:13.32]That's a clean 250 right off the bat.
[461:16.14]There's a 500 there.
[461:16.98]There's a 500 right here.
[461:19.94]Bingo!
[461:20.44]Just get the other one.
[461:20.98]There's one more in there.
[461:25.60]Here it comes.
[461:29.06]Shit.
[461:33.08]Oh my god.
[461:45.32]Okay.
[461:45.90]I'm out.
[461:47.02]One more 500 and I'm done.
[461:48.24]This one right here.
[461:52.66]There it is.
[461:53.20]I'm done.
[461:59.37]I have a couple more chances to get him.
[462:00.55]I got the H. Got the C. There's the Y. Two H's.
[462:30.48]Oh!
[462:36.63]Dear me, this has come to an end.
[462:40.61]Yeah, it is going to come to an end pretty soon, because I'm going to get the money I needed.
[462:46.14]I should have been doing this a long time ago.
[462:49.46]I'm consistently going to have 10 grand.
[462:53.08]Where's the K and the E?
[462:54.16]And that's it.
[462:54.60]I'm just opened.
[463:00.75]I just missed it again.
[463:04.02]I'm fine.
[463:04.70]Everything's fine.
[463:05.20]What are you guys talking about?
[463:05.92]Why is everybody freaking out?
[463:08.68]What's wrong?
[463:09.06]What's the matter?
[463:14.03]Where's the O?
[463:14.31]You have to go to work in the morning?
[463:20.65]We will be done within the next 25 minutes.
[463:31.50]That would have been a 500.
[463:36.30]Here comes the K. Slapshot!
[463:40.98]I love how I'm still trying to put in, like, interesting commentary here.
[463:46.09]Like, really?
[463:48.05]You really still trying to do that?
[463:49.59]Alright.
[463:55.02]Alright.
[464:01.76]Okay, here we go, right here.
[464:10.91]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[464:20.76]Nobody touch my uncooked spaghetti, please.
[464:29.74]You son of a... No.
[464:37.13]I'm going to be at like 8,800.
[464:41.59]Alright.
[464:42.33]Give me the K and that's it.
[464:45.43]Sneak that 250 in there.
[464:54.23]Is there any 500?
[464:54.69]I haven't seen a 500 in a long time.
[464:57.07]I'm on right arrow.
[465:01.33]You piece of crap.
[465:17.43]No!
[465:32.46]What the fuck?
[465:35.70]Here's what I got.
[465:36.06]I got a 500.
[465:36.30]Finally.
[465:43.21]Alright.
[465:44.39]Give me some more fives and I'm out.
[465:50.39]I'll take a 250.
[465:50.92]Alright.
[465:55.50]I'm out.
[466:00.36]Printed.
[466:11.36]This is a shitload.
[466:12.70]I'm gonna be nearly... I'm gonna be like 10% away there almost.
[466:15.91]This is gonna be 10,000.
[466:22.69]84,000.
[466:25.69]Alright, now we're gonna do a little bit of relaxing balloon... catch.
[466:32.87]Just relax.
[466:35.53]Um... I haven't gone to the bathroom in 8 hours.
[466:46.78]I haven't done a bathroom break, have I?
[466:48.50]This whole stream, have I?
[466:55.40]No?
[467:06.51]You have gone, you just haven't noticed.
[467:10.13]Right.
[467:11.23]Right.
[467:12.13]Yeah.
[467:20.36]How much water have I had?
[467:22.34]Uh, probably two glasses of water.
[467:25.42]Why am I lying to you guys?
[467:27.72]I've been sitting here.
[467:30.96]That's a lie.
[467:32.08]I lied right to you.
[467:32.98]I've been here.
[467:33.94]I've been sitting here.
[467:36.87]I had a big cup of fluid here.
[467:39.87]And then, oh yeah, I've had maybe two glasses of water.
[467:44.40]Oh, really?
[467:44.82]Because I can go back through the VOD and see that you haven't left once and you haven't drank anything.
[467:53.71]Get it together.
[467:57.00]Alright, let's get... Okay, that was at a clean 1,500.
[467:58.74]Alright, that's 1,500.
[468:01.34]Let me get like 6,000 to 7,000 here.
[468:18.57]when your internet went out.
[468:20.91]I was just sitting here, though.
[468:22.49]Actually, I walked out to see if the whole house's internet was off.
[468:27.99]And it was.
[468:29.37]So then I kind of came right back in.
[468:38.24]After I do this, we'll take a break.
[468:42.42]I'll come back, and we'll finish up.
[468:46.44]We've been going for a long time.
[468:59.39]This VOD may be deceiving, but it's been about eight to eight and a half hours or so.
[469:05.13]Just pick it up.
[469:09.03]I'm not ending?
[469:09.75]Well, I mean, yeah, I will.
[469:12.29]Not right this second.
[469:13.85]Alright, what's that get me to?
[469:24.79]We're very close.
[469:30.43]Um, I'm thinking... I'm thinking Mega Jackpot here.
[469:40.38]Mega Jackpot is 6,200.
[469:41.72]Just need to hit it once.
[469:45.58]What'd I get?
[469:45.92]I'll add a ball.
[469:47.36]Let's wait for the Jackpot.
[469:58.31]Get in there.
[469:59.79]Aww.
[470:02.43]So anytime your friends ask you if you want to go to Dave & Buster's or Chuck E. Cheese or something... Usually that entire experience is about three to four hours.
[470:19.14]Oh, wait, he's talking about companies again.
[470:20.80]Yeah, but I shouldn't be talking about companies.
[470:28.60]Drop them all in?
[470:29.92]I don't think I can.
[470:31.49]You can only do them one at a time.
[470:34.41]Yeah, I can't do it right now.
[470:36.44]This is a different version, I think.
[470:41.34]Yeah.
[470:44.32]No, I don't know.
[470:46.66]This one's too random.
[470:48.10]I'd rather just do the, uh... I'd rather just do the hockey game.
[470:51.74]Or Chicken Little.
[470:53.80]Let's do Chicken Little.
[471:18.42]Got it.
[471:18.74]Okay.
[471:19.23]Bonus.
[471:21.31]Oh!
[471:21.81]Almost happened.
[471:25.39]This machine.
[471:25.79]No.
[471:25.99]This machine.
[471:26.95]No.
[471:28.17]It's not going to happen.
[471:28.79]I don't want to play this one.
[471:33.23]No.
[471:33.56]No.
[471:33.94]No.
[471:34.26]No.
[471:34.40]No.
[471:34.74]No.
[471:40.68]Going back to the hockey machine.
[471:41.64]That's the best one.
[471:46.25]No, I don't want to play again.
[471:47.15]I'm going to take these tickets.
[471:48.55]I'm going to go outside and I'm going to save the game.
[471:58.58]Okay.
[472:00.14]Let's go to the hockey game.
[472:01.02]All I need is... I need like 13,000 tickets.
[472:05.18]I'll get it.
[472:05.54]I'm going to do two of these.
[472:06.64]I'm going to just knock it out of the park right now.
[472:09.01]This is the O. Here comes the Y.
[472:13.51]I got the K. Didn't even try to get it and I still got it.
[472:15.77]Here comes the O and the C. It's alright.
[472:26.00]This is fine.
[472:27.30]It's a good start.
[472:33.42]Ring it around again.
[472:34.10]E. Good.
[472:45.50]Just need the H. We need the H and the Y. I'll take another 500.
[472:51.54]I'll take that.
[472:52.38]That's pretty good.
[472:52.98]I'll take it.
[472:53.48]I'm happy with that.
[472:54.23]Take another 500.
[472:57.03]Ooh, not quite.
[473:05.61]What you've noticed is Jerma's number of tickets have not gone up and we are in hell.
[473:11.86]Well, that would be bad.
[473:13.74]I missed.
[473:17.25]You're gonna grab a drink?
[473:17.97]Don't do too much while I'm gone.
[473:21.05]Um... I definitely think you have enough time to get back.
[473:26.39]Get in there.
[473:26.91]Come on, I gotta get this quick.
[473:28.29]I need, like, another 10,000.
[473:33.06]You stupid game.
[473:40.38]It's because... Yeah, I haven't gone to the counting machine.
[473:53.46]This is it, right here.
[473:56.46]Oh, so close!
[473:57.84]I'm so close.
[474:01.48]Finally.
[474:06.52]He's not gonna make it.
[474:07.93]I will definitely make it before midnight.
[474:09.45]Like, that's certain.
[474:16.83]Before midnight Pacific, before I turn into a fucking gremlin, this will happen.
[474:24.46]Why would I just swing right there?
[474:26.82]Not with those kind of mistakes, you're not gonna do it.
[474:28.54]H.
[475:07.86]Ah!
[475:14.44]What, did anyone know what's on the ground?
[475:15.67]How much is on the ground right now?
[475:20.81]20, 22,000.
[475:21.45]Alright.
[475:21.99]How much is on the ground?
[475:29.89]Several?
[475:30.23]Okay, let me get a good count here.
[475:34.56]Hold on.
[475:51.19]I need just about 8,000.
[476:04.49]So close.
[476:07.62]We're just going for points now.
[476:08.58]I don't know.
[476:08.84]Who cares about the... The H's, the E's, the K's.
[476:14.36]Who cares?
[476:14.84]8,700.
[476:14.86]Good.
[476:19.36]Good.
[476:37.45]Good!
[476:47.02]Seventy- sixty-seven hundred.
[476:53.77]Good.
[477:06.91]Get in there.
[477:07.85]500.
[477:09.93]That's alright.
[477:10.51]I'll take these little thousands.
[477:12.37]That's fine.
[477:30.52]See?
[477:33.78]Comes the E.
[477:36.79]Coming at you with a... Now I just need the H. And I... We're gonna be very close.
[478:02.36]How did that go through all that?
[478:03.44]I don't understand how that happened.
[478:16.79]What's with the running water?
[478:18.65]Does a running water sound?
[478:23.69]Why do I hear running water?
[478:35.42]He's pissing himself.
[478:45.73]That was pretty funny.
[478:50.95]Get in the H. Got it.
[478:52.77]Alright.
[478:53.81]2,000.
[479:01.22]Give me some of this.
[479:01.94]Come on.
[479:03.48]Give me some of this.
[479:05.58]Where's the 500?
[479:09.58]It's 250 coming up.
[479:12.28]Ooh.
[479:13.72]There's a 500 right there.
[479:15.07]Alright.
[479:15.33]What do I got?
[479:16.25]Cash it in.
[479:24.96]We're almost at 100,000 tickets.
[479:25.74]97,326.
[479:25.76]Now I'm going to play a game that I like.
[480:07.00]I just have to do this three times.
[480:12.48]That is pretty damn close.
[480:14.64]How is that not accurate?
[480:37.72]Oh, yeah!
[480:54.73]2,000 more.
[480:56.59]How do I end this?
[480:57.43]What do I do with this?
[480:58.31]What should be the last thing I do?
[481:23.16]Bonus.
[481:34.66]Get that card in there.
[481:35.50]Nice.
[481:41.01]Good drop.
[481:49.33]Got it.
[481:51.81]Alright.
[481:54.15]Okay, now I can... That was fun.
[481:57.01]Let's do some other... Let's have an alt.
[482:15.69]Hey guys, I've got a funny idea.
[482:33.18]Let me try to get a good 500 from this.
[482:40.48]It's been five hours.
[482:41.68]I can get that one.
[482:50.98]Almost.
[483:01.59]It's 200 tickets!
[483:04.12]That's not bad.
[483:13.67]Ah!
[483:17.98]Overshot the damn thing.
[483:19.06]I don't even know where it is.
[483:26.02]I only got five minutes left?
[483:30.99]It's 1146, what are you talking about?
[483:35.35]There's like 14 minutes left.
[483:36.89]14 minutes until what?
[483:59.25]Until I have to have 100,000 tickets.
[484:05.78]Alright, I get a bonus swing here.
[484:12.70]Not even close.
[484:17.56]You need more money, too.
[484:18.72]Well, the idea is get the boombox and see how much I can sell the boombox for.
[484:21.76]Ooh!
[484:31.52]That's bullshit.
[484:32.16]I tried.
[484:32.52]Alright, I'm outta here.
[484:33.68]I'm out.
[484:34.14]I'm out.
[484:34.56]I'm out.
[484:34.82]Last one.
[484:36.70]This is actually the last one of the whole night.
[484:39.40]Better make it a classic.
[484:46.19]Nah, that's not... I can't go out on that one.
[484:51.67]Here we go.
[484:51.99]Better make it a classic. ...
[485:09.46]Going out on a classic.
[485:12.46]Here we go.
[485:14.56]Where's the green ball?
[485:17.24]Up there.
[485:23.51]It's okay.
[485:24.05]Alright.
[485:24.35]Whatever.
[485:24.63]I've got 500 tickets.
[485:25.13]I'm going.
[485:35.37]Okay.
[485:36.05]Feed in the last one.
[485:37.11]And see what the last number is.
[485:41.11]99394.
[485:44.85]I need a stacker.
[485:46.31]This is it.
[485:48.11]Check this.
[485:50.72]This is the worst possible place this could be.
[486:20.15]Thank you.
[486:24.37]100.
[486:25.49]And that's... I need... What a dumb game.
[486:29.03]Let's go out on skeeball.
[486:40.65]No, I just got the bonus.
[486:42.77]I got the green light on the chicken.
[486:44.43]Why would I go back to chicken?
[486:53.39]Oh my god, that went right into the 10.
[486:55.25]Why am I so bad at this?
[487:12.18]Finally.
[487:12.58]100 tickets?

[487:21.11]I'm gonna do the, um...
[487:23.04]I'm gonna do the balls, the drop the ball thing.
[487:27.38]That'll be a clean... I wanna get to exactly 10,000 tickets.
[487:31.80]I'm that much of a fucking weirdo.
[487:36.25]I mean, 100,000.
[487:36.79]Okay, let's see, how much, what do I need?
[487:50.49]Okay, 996.
[487:51.11]I need to get, like, 400.
[487:52.19]Three.
[487:52.33]I need three.
[487:52.75]356.
[487:52.89]Yes, I want the hundreds.

[488:58.19]Alright, what have I got now?
[489:03.86]Those are ten!
[489:04.58]These are ten fucking tickets!
[489:18.97]What's that of money?
[489:20.55]I got eight minutes?
[489:23.49]I got plenty of time.
[489:36.09]I'm just going in and dropping it in a random spot.
[489:38.55]It'll always get at least 10.
[489:42.18]Whatever.
[489:42.40]I'm going to go cash these in and see what it is.
[489:49.56]Grab the 50.
[489:52.14]Grab the 50!
[489:53.06]No more 10s!
[489:53.48]Fucking stupid game.
[490:10.43]I've been here for over 24 hours, kid.
[490:13.84]You don't know the shit I've seen.
[490:18.00]99689.
[490:23.59]What?
[490:26.07]That shit's five bucks.
[490:32.97]It's gotta be skeetball.
[490:33.80]It has to be.
[490:43.63]Can I get one point?
[491:00.84]That's three tickets, right?
[491:02.16]No, is that thirty or three?
[491:17.00]Do you understand how hard it is to do it in this game?
[491:20.56]Give me a real one.
[491:23.40]It's at the same speed, at the same place, and it just fucking ran into the wall.
[491:32.63]Oh, look at me!
[491:33.25]Oh, Jabbersocks, look at me!
[491:51.56]Alright, what was that?
[491:52.39]How many tickets?
[491:52.87]160.
[491:55.17]Hold on.
[491:55.49]99849.
[491:55.67]I need one ticket.
[492:08.00]Claw machine.
[492:08.74]What do you mean claw...
[492:20.64]How do I get... Do I have to drop... I think I have to drop one coin down.
[492:27.38]Yeah, I gotta drop a coin down.
[492:29.36]One single coin.
[492:32.80]Don't want to get too many coins here.
[492:51.03]No, I don't want the bonus.
[492:54.47]I just want one coin to drop.
[492:55.61]Let's see.
[492:55.91]Hold on.
[492:56.15]Give it a second.
[493:00.22]Ay!
[493:02.34]Here we go.
[493:02.66]This will drop one.
[493:03.62]One.
[493:05.18]Ooh, it dropped two.
[493:06.94]That's okay.
[493:13.85]The ball dropped!
[493:14.47]You're right.
[493:14.99]I can just drop one in the bucket.
[493:16.57]You're right.
[493:16.99]Okay.
[493:18.25]I gotta waste these.
[493:21.23]I just want to pick them up.
[493:32.44]Okay.
[493:32.74]It's going to be a shitty amount of tickets.
[493:34.46]Who cares?
[493:40.70]Let's see.
[493:40.96]99869.
[493:40.98]Was it printing?
[493:41.62]How many is that?
[493:49.90]It's only 20, thank God.
[493:50.94]Okay, I need to go to the- hold on.
[493:53.98]Somebody in there?
[493:56.80]I'm gonna do the ball drop machine.
[494:06.81]I got three- I got plenty of time.
[494:14.18]Was it 49-49?
[494:18.58]I'm not even... Even if I run out of time, it's fine.
[494:21.86]I did it.
[494:26.54]I did... I'm there.
[494:28.36]I did it.
[494:31.88]I'm here.
[494:32.66]I did it.
[494:33.94]I have 99,800.
[494:35.59]I could just go sink a hoop right now and be done.
[494:38.05]But I want to have exactly 100,000.
[494:39.27]So let's do... It's 49,49.
[494:42.49]Here we go.
[494:48.10]Let's do 49, 49.

[494:49.20]500 tickets!
[494:50.28]What?
[494:50.44]I didn't get it.
[495:12.27]I didn't sink that.
[495:17.32]No!
[495:17.78]No!
[495:18.04]Stop cheering for me!
[495:18.92]Get out of here!
[495:20.72]That didn't go in a bowl!
[495:23.96]Just don't touch those ones.
[495:24.90]Wait.
[495:25.10]Move them out of the way.
[495:26.20]I have to move those.
[495:26.84]20 seconds.
[495:38.67]Okay.
[495:39.37]Move these out of the way.
[495:49.47]Okay, there's 20.
[495:52.65]I can't get the exact number, guys.
[495:57.45]I can't.
[495:57.85]No, I can't do the exact number.
[495:58.97]Look.
[496:00.13]It's 10.
[496:01.45]I need to get one ticket.
[496:11.37]How do I get one ticket?
[496:20.98]I don't give a fuck.
[496:30.25]I just got an achievement.
[496:30.93]100,000.
[496:30.95]100,000 tickets.
[496:31.33]Check this out.
[496:31.77]Now I'm gonna buy...
[496:56.60]Okay, that's it.
[496:57.54]Hold on.
[496:59.12]I need... I need another... I'm not gonna buy 1,000 glow sticks.
[497:09.03]Who cares about exactly 100,000?
[497:11.27]It don't matter.
[497:11.87]I win.
[497:12.95]Give me the boom box.

[497:29.59]Just wait.
[497:29.95]Hold on.
[497:30.25]Alright.
[497:30.85]I can't even get one single ticket.
[497:32.89]It's not possible.
[497:37.89]There's no way for me to get one ticket.
[497:47.52]It's gonna have to be like four.
[498:02.57]No, fuck it.
[498:03.49]Bye.
[498:04.23]See you later.
[498:04.97]Goodbye.

[498:09.40]Buy the boombox.
[498:19.26]There it is.
[498:22.71]My 100,000 ticket boombox.
[498:26.31]Can I turn it on?
[498:33.51]I don't think there's an on switch.
[498:34.51]Alright, how much is this worth? $41,000.
[499:03.86]I thought it was going to be two, three, almost 42,000 fucking dollars to get the boom box.
[499:15.28]Oh my God.
[499:16.34]That's an entire year's income.
[499:24.67]That that's like a, that's a, that's like a fucking like after taxes and until like,

[499:50.88]We took 41 grand of Uncle Phil's money.
[499:54.51]I'm sa- Alright, save the game first.
[500:00.53]Not like I'm gonna really ever play this again until there's more stuff to do.
[500:07.06]Alright, moment of truth.
[500:08.36]Was this worth doing?
[500:10.06]What can I get from my $41,000 boombox?
[501:35.49]This is such like a degenerate thing.
[501:37.46]Look at the ground.
[501:39.04]Why is nobody cleaning this up?
[501:49.07]Thanks, Uncle Phil.

[504:27.25]You deserve to play.
[504:29.45]You've been very patient.
[504:31.49]Good luck.
[504:34.49]Right before the... If the internet kills us, if the internet, like, turns us off, thanks for watching, everybody.
[504:39.30]That was a... At least we got the boombox.
[504:52.91]Well, it's not winning.
[504:54.75]So, it's not winning.
[504:56.91]Alright, here we go.
[505:03.08]Four.
[505:03.90]25 bucks.
[505:04.76]Not a good start.
[505:05.82]Not a bad start either, though.
[505:25.79]What's wrong with my Twitch?
[505:28.79]Because I just tried to click the add button again and it doesn't work.
[505:33.84]I cannot run ads.
[505:36.46]Commercial break failed.
[505:40.84]I tried it.
[505:47.17]Well, besides commercial break, it looks like you're going right here.
[505:51.63]Not good.
[505:58.36]Why am I trying to run ads?
[505:59.60]Because people are clicking on ads.
[506:03.75]I can't do it.
[506:04.41]I have to wait eight minutes before we can do that again.
[506:07.53]Did they like shut me off?
[506:13.65]What did I do?
[506:14.17]Did I say like the F word too many times?
[506:19.10]Did I say like fuck like 2,000 times?
[506:22.30]Is that like the threshold?
[506:25.30]I can't click this one.
[506:27.36]Pick another one.
[506:32.76]Try again.
[506:39.23]I can't do that one.
[506:39.93]Look.
[506:40.57]See?
[506:40.79]I can't click this one.
[506:51.06]Do you hear this?
[506:59.30]I'm going to try this one more time.
[507:09.28]Alright.
[507:11.27]You guys are in a lot of trouble.
[507:16.09]Imagine taking this seriously.
[507:17.75]I'm taking it dead serious.
[507:18.69]This is the final scratch card.
[507:27.96]I'm just gonna take whatever the highest percent is.
[507:29.86]I can't click this one, so it's gonna have to be this one down here.
[507:35.14]Uh-oh, you got one more three.
[507:47.49]Where is it going to be?
[507:50.33]Top right?
[507:52.17]Mm-hmm.
[507:52.99]Top right.
[507:55.26]Oh!
[507:56.90]Sorry, everybody.
[507:58.92]Sorry.

[508:18.17]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[508:19.13]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[508:22.42]Not yet.
[508:22.72]Hold on.
[508:25.08]Not yet.
[508:25.62]Not yet.
[508:26.30]I want to go actually light off fireworks.
[508:28.89]I want to buy some fireworks.
[508:30.41]Let's go take another, like, ten grand from our uncle.
[508:44.26]By the way, if you're just catching us later here, there's no stream tomorrow.
[508:48.06]Typically I do two or three days in a row.
[508:50.44]But there's no stream tomorrow.
[508:51.98]Because tomorrow I am having a meeting about my own carnival stream.
[508:57.90]So there's no stream tomorrow.
[509:00.22]I'll be back a day later.
[509:03.10]I'll be back on Sunday.
[509:09.70]Trying to get shit done, as they say.
[509:11.71]Alright, let's go back and get some money.
[509:17.79]Oh, an official business meeting.
[509:25.41]Carnival.
[509:26.30]Tell us more.
[509:29.14]I've spoken about it a few times.
[509:30.36]There's probably a few clips.
[509:31.46]I don't really want to get into it.
[509:39.05]Fucking kids.
[509:44.23]Move, please.
[509:44.85]I just want to buy fireworks.
[509:56.64]What game is this?
[509:57.36]This is called The Coin Game.
[509:59.00]It's currently in early access.
[510:03.94]It's essentially just an arcade game that also has a little carnival in it.
[510:08.39]With midway games.
[510:12.83]Just little ticket redemption games.
[510:14.25]A little time waster.
[510:15.13]It's pretty fun.
[510:18.08]So they plan on adding a lot more stuff, I guess.
[510:26.87]They're adding rides?
[510:27.67]Oh, the rides are already in it.
[510:29.61]There is a full-on carnival that is down the street.
[510:35.52]I just got stuck in here because I freaked out and had to get 100,000 tickets.
[510:39.04]Alright, let's go to the pier.
[510:43.52]I want to buy some fireworks and I want to light them off.
[510:45.56]No, see, that's what I'm talking about.
[510:48.87]You can get on all these rides.
[510:50.19]You can play all these little mini-games.
[510:51.37]We did them already a few hours ago.
[510:54.69]Beach, beach, pier, pier, beach, you know, same damn thing.

[518:15.27]That was a lot of cards.
[518:16.57]Okay.
[518:17.39]I made it.
[518:22.90]Shooting flares up.
[518:29.10]Why is there no sound at all?
[518:30.84]It's all gone.
[518:40.25]Well, that was it.
[518:42.34]That was fun.
[518:42.84]I don't think I've even been... This is my house?
[518:46.02]What is this?
[518:46.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[518:47.28]This is my house!
[518:51.43]I didn't even know I had this.
[518:58.78]Surfboard?
[518:59.24]Can I take the surfboard?
[519:00.36]Is it gonna take anything?
[519:08.17]This is where I'm supposed to bring my cool stuff.
[519:10.97]I could have put the boombox here.
[519:12.77]Yep.
[519:14.69]Well, that's sad.
[519:19.55]Can I take any of this stuff?
[519:21.01]Anything at all?
[519:27.82]And I mean, I'm talking about can I have anything?
[519:29.58]Can I pick up anything over here?
[519:37.83]Oh, it's a light.
[520:13.53]Yeah, see, the UFO's not done.
[520:14.91]See, under construction, it's not done.
[520:18.17]You can't get in.
[520:22.73]See?
[520:25.19]There's no way to get in.
[520:35.64]Reload the save for the boombox?
[520:43.53]Uh, I don't think I can.
[520:47.04]I think I have to exit the game and come back.
[520:50.70]That's alright.
[520:51.17]I have that save.
[520:51.95]We're fine.
[520:53.13]Forklift.
[520:54.31]Can't do anything with the forklift.
[521:25.11]That's it.
[521:26.77]That's it!
[521:36.49]That was fun.
[521:37.33]I'm glad I went through that whole thing.
[521:43.89]That was worth doing.
[521:45.76]So, I will see you guys on Sunday.
[521:49.32]Glad we got to get at least like an eight or nine hour... That was almost a nine hour stream, right?
[521:53.08]So far?
[521:54.25]Yeah.
[521:54.91]Nine and a half.
[521:57.11]The last two streams have been very long.
[521:58.57]I don't know what it is.
[522:03.47]But I am going to go to the bathroom.
[522:05.61]I'm going to go get a drink of water and I'm going to go use the bathroom.
[522:09.06]And we'll come back and we'll do the bits and the subs.
[522:10.32]Somebody says ban me, coward.
[522:13.74]Why would I do that?
[522:16.18]No.
[522:16.60]You're staying unbanned.
[522:22.53]Pretty cool.
[522:23.13]Pretty fun.
[522:27.16]It gets the job done.
[522:28.48]How much is that game?
[522:30.10]How much was this?
[522:32.52]I don't think it was that expensive.
[522:41.53]Was it like $8?
[522:45.37]It's $9?
[522:46.13]$9.
[522:46.15]$8.99.
[522:47.11]And that, they just put in that carnival.
[522:53.32]That just went in.

[526:51.16]Over here.
[526:59.84]Do more dunko?
[527:01.10]I don't think that's not going to happen.
[527:06.25]So let's go back to...
[527:11.15]Oh, nine and a half hours ago.
[527:13.01]Really?
[527:13.47]Holy shit.
[527:18.15]That kind of just went by me.
[527:20.78]Thank you to Trident Jacks for the five dollars.
[527:22.64]Did you say bleed purple?
[527:25.96]Thank you, Trident Jacks, for the five bucks.
[527:27.38]Appreciate it.
[527:29.66]S10W update.
[527:30.98]I know that's not your name, but I kind of like saying it.
[527:32.87]Hey, do you remember this might be the last of my bit streak?
[527:37.48]I'm kind of busy making a feature-length Jerma video.
[527:40.75]It's basically a retelling of the Doom story from 1 to Eternal.
[527:45.35]Hopefully.
[527:46.59]It'll be my first big project like this.
[527:49.43]I was gonna announce it during the green screen encore, but that plan changed.
[527:53.60]So I do have a trailer for it with the release date, hopefully.
[527:55.98]Hopefully you can see it and enjoy it.
[527:57.18]Good luck in life, and thank you for being great.
[528:00.66]Trailer.
[528:05.05]I'm ready for this let's give it a watch if I can even add it let's see if I can that's not it it's that
[528:52.01]Smoking it again.
[529:36.03]Is that going to be a grenade?
[529:37.79]Oh, you didn't think I was going to catch it?
[530:01.88]That was so loud.
[530:22.03]Hold on.
[530:24.70]Hold on.
[530:38.06]What a fucking idiot.
[530:43.31]Oh no.
[530:56.88]January 23rd, 2020.
[530:58.38]That's an actual full-length movie.
[531:08.92]That was fucking awesome.
[531:09.70]Thank you.
[531:13.17]Wish me luck.
[531:13.75]Good luck with that.
[531:14.83]Hopefully you can get it done.
[531:18.05]Whatever you do, sure it'll be fucking great.
[531:20.89]So thank you for that.
[531:22.07]Good luck with that.
[531:24.07]When you say full length, do you mean a full length movie?
[531:27.31]90 minutes.
[531:37.34]I don't think there's even enough green screen footage to do a 90 minute movie.
[531:41.72]Maybe there is.
[531:44.74]But good luck.
[531:45.22]That sounds fucking hilarious, so thank you.
[531:49.42]Kinda.
[531:50.02]Oh my god.
[531:54.27]Holy shit.
[531:59.27]A 90-minute movie.
[532:04.36]Wow.
[532:05.18]Well, that's... That's gonna be one for the books.
[532:11.40]Thank you, though, for that.

[532:14.81]Thank you to Crazy Burger for the 10 bucks.
[532:16.89]Hey, Jerma, first time donator here.
[532:18.01]I've been watching your stream for a couple years.
[532:20.27]And you're absolutely the funniest man on the internet.

[532:41.34]My jokes aren't terrible, though.
[532:42.38]Some of them are.
[532:45.23]I think, like, 30% of the jokes are terrible, and the other 70% are fucking, like, wow.
[532:49.59]Am I watching a comedian on stage?
[532:51.87]Or is this... Is this, like, a stream?
[532:53.99]I don't understand.

[533:50.84]Is Saturdos dead?
[533:52.22]No.
[533:54.54]I've just been streaming a little less, so I have kind of been trying to put things in that I wanted to do.
[533:59.81]At least the last, like, two or three weeks have been cutting back a little.
[534:05.17]Um...
[534:07.42]Maybe we'll just do that on Sunday.
[534:10.01]And then the next video game stream, whether that's Monday or Tuesday, we'll do Sam & Max.
[534:15.57]Or we'll do Sam & Max on Sunday and do that on Monday or something.
[534:18.81]Or Tuesday or whatever.
[534:20.52]We'll figure it out.
[534:22.02]That'll be within the next couple streams.

[534:24.24]It was interesting to do that.

[536:39.92]Hey Jerma, I've been watching your stream since 2017 when I started college.
[536:43.28]And your streams have helped out as I've felt depressed.
[536:46.34]I figured out what was bothering me.
[536:48.65]I had spent too much time away from writing and drawing, but I'm back at it and happy again.
[536:53.15]Maybe one of these days I'll post something in the art channel of the Jerma Discord when I have the courage.
[536:57.87]I also need to socialize more, life of an introvert.
[537:01.07]Anyway, thanks for all the laughs and good times.
[537:03.58]It helped.
[537:05.88]My pleasure.
[537:08.23]and yeah don't feel like you have to he said don't I maybe if I have the courage to put it in the Discord that creative channel they are channels that just they're there for people just to share you know I I don't want anyone to have to post stuff there and have it be like well uh this is not good enough no it's not that's not the purpose of that channel
[537:34.86]So, thank you so much for the $15.
[537:36.27]Definitely share something when you have it, or if you feel like it.
[537:40.47]And don't feel pressured to do so, either.
[537:43.79]But don't feel like you'll be judged for doing so.
[537:50.01]But thank you for the $15, and it's my pleasure.
[537:55.38]Also, Alamitos gave $2.50.
[537:57.90]Alamitos.
[537:59.32]Why does the vessel sometimes disobey us and then says something like this to us?
[538:05.07]What is this?
[538:05.63]What do I say?
[538:06.35]What is this?
[538:10.21]Jerma, talk.
[538:10.89]Jerma, don't talk.
[538:11.93]Hey, you shut up.
[538:13.05]Be quiet.
[538:13.81]Why aren't you talking?
[538:15.05]Where are the jokes?
[538:17.32]Pay attention!
[538:19.38]Do we have like a poll in chat here?
[538:30.92]I hate you guys so much.
[538:45.56]Yeah, well, I wasn't talking about the chat.
[538:48.06]I was talking about the stupid flying gargoyle enemies in Metal Gear Rising.
[538:54.92]Jerva, talk.
[538:55.57]Jerva, don't talk.
[538:56.75]Jerva, tell a joke.
[538:57.77]Jerva, why are you not paying attention to the game?
[539:00.73]Jerva, shut up.
[539:01.47]I don't think that's funny.
[539:02.63]I thought that was funny.
[539:03.37]Do it again.
[539:10.00]It's okay to vent your frustrations.
[539:11.50]I was not talking about chat.
[539:13.66]I swear to God.
[539:15.86]It was lined up wrong.
[539:18.03]I was talking about the stupid- And I immediately after that freaked out and was like, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[539:24.47]You can- That's taken out of context.
[539:25.57]You gotta see the next part.
[539:26.91]That is a fake clip.
[539:28.59]And it was just the- What is it?
[539:31.57]What's the- The thing from Scooby-Doo.
[539:37.36]What does he say?
[539:45.31]Yes, Coolsville.
[539:47.03]I think Coolsville sucks.
[539:48.67]Yes.
[540:01.11]You what?
[540:03.57]That happened to me.
[540:07.89]Thank you for the $2.50, Floridian Weapon.
[540:09.61]Appreciate the $2.50.
[540:12.71]Yuta Wang, thanks for the $2.50.
[540:15.96]What is this?
[540:17.60]Oh god, it's a comic.
[540:18.48]Hold on, let's put this on the screen.
[540:24.33]Did I save it?
[540:29.67]Did I get it?
[540:33.65]I did.
[540:34.17]No, did I just save this?
[540:35.63]What did I just save that to?
[540:38.37]Oh, I hate computers.
[540:45.88]I really just don't want to have... Computers are really, really good.
[540:50.26]And they don't have any problems at all.
[540:52.52]And I would really hate to be captured out of context saying something like, I think computers suck.
[540:58.30]So... No, wait!
[541:14.69]Oh, this is big.
[541:17.15]Clip it, clip it, clip it!
[541:30.72]This is not even it.
[541:35.46]I really just don't... Out of context, saying something like, I think computers suck.
[541:40.67]You gotta just get this part.
[541:43.61]So...
[541:46.23]I think computers suck.
[541:47.61]I think computers suck.
[541:49.45]There.
[541:53.02]And then, oh, hey, wait, wait, wait.
[541:54.34]We get into the comic.
[541:56.06]Hey, can you win us a second banana?
[541:58.80]You promised.
[541:59.84]Hey, Talos could do this way better.
[542:01.42]Well, you suck.
[542:02.28]LOL.
[542:04.14]Fuck, fuck this game.
[542:06.58]I'm gonna stop when I'm at zero.
[542:08.94]Stop.
[542:09.20]No, please.
[542:09.92]You're addicted.
[542:10.62]No, you have no money.
[542:18.11]Shithead Child, by the way, is on here.
[542:22.87]I didn't write this.
[542:23.81]I didn't write this.
[542:30.87]Oh, that's awesome.
[542:33.17]The comic as a whole is fucking hilarious.
[542:35.89]Thank you.
[542:44.11]But thank you for that.
[542:44.81]That was Liuda Wang.
[542:50.34]We also had... $5 from Zach, $13.
[542:56.12]Jesus, Jerma, you're making me laugh my ass off.
[542:58.22]This has been too good.
[542:59.18]I'm not sure what I said, but I'm glad you thought it was funny.
[543:07.01]And then Balla Koala had with... I think I missed this.
[543:09.33]It was $50 from earlier.
[543:10.59]Bet you can't get the double green hits on Dizzy Bird.
[543:14.60]Was that when I was in Meltdown?
[543:16.60]No, that was not... I had those two Meltdowns.
[543:19.59]There was the real one.
[543:20.43]That was about 45 minutes of me not being able to do it.
[543:22.75]Then was the fake one.
[543:24.17]Was that during the fake Meltdown or the real one?
[543:26.39]I don't remember.
[543:27.81]But that's a lot of money.
[543:28.68]Thanks for 50 bucks.
[543:29.42]You gave another 50 bucks earlier.
[543:30.90]I mean, later too, so...
[543:34.88]Thank you so much for that.
[543:35.76]There was a ton of community subs.
[543:37.10]Tingy gave what seemed like 5,000 community subs.
[543:42.18]Thank you, Tingy, for your insane amount of community subs today.
[543:46.51]Uh, NicoCat gave 10 bucks.
[543:52.39]Hey, Jerma, me and my brother Charlie always love watching your streams together.
[543:55.11]You're the funniest streamer we've ever seen, and we love every joke you make.
[543:59.01]From the best plus twos to the worst minus twos.
[544:02.37]Today's stream has been great, but he couldn't watch today's stream because he's in the hospital for a seizure.
[544:08.62]Do you think you could wish him to get better soon?
[544:10.48]It would really help him feel better.
[544:11.72]Thanks, Jerma.
[544:12.18]You're the best.
[544:14.16]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[544:18.06]But, hey, Charlie, hope you get better soon.
[544:21.34]Feel better soon.
[544:24.92]Me and all the rats.
[544:26.55]We're pulling for you.
[544:31.85]Take care, Charlie.
[544:33.89]Get well soon.
[544:35.49]We miss you.
[544:36.41]We want you here.
[544:43.49]But thank you, NicoCat.
[544:45.60]Anytime I hear that people can connect somehow, whether it's a friend or a relative or something, watching these streams, that makes me really happy.
[544:53.44]Because that means that this community, this stream here, is something that can bring people together, which is nice.
[545:06.47]And thank you for the $10, too.
[545:07.73]I really appreciate it.
[545:17.99]Scrolling up here.
[545:18.59]We got tingy more community.
[545:19.99]How many how many subs a tingy have today?
[545:24.53]Over a hundred had to be It's gotta be like let's see Hundred yeah, they were at least a hundred
[545:41.35]Wow.
[545:41.65]That's a lot.
[545:42.15]120.
[545:42.31]Oh my god.
[545:45.79]Sometimes some of you guys get so generous and you just drop hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[545:55.70]Thank you.
[545:57.44]And Tingy with $5 here on top of that.
[545:59.64]I don't know how much of my paycheck is left after tonight, but it doesn't matter.
[546:03.86]I had fun.
[546:05.07]And you deserve it.
[546:07.75]As much as you think so, I really appreciate that.
[546:10.61]But also take care of yourself, too.
[546:13.39]You are way more important than I am.
[546:21.10]So hopefully you can take care of yourself, too.
[546:24.16]Because that's number one.
[546:25.46]That's most important.
[546:27.12]But thank you so much, Tingy.
[546:28.10]That was ridiculous.
[546:29.76]So thank you.
[546:33.80]We also had ten more dollars from Crazy Burger.
[546:37.09]I can't believe I stayed up till 7 a.m.
[546:38.67]watching this stream.
[546:39.99]Have some more money, Germany.
[546:41.15]We all really love you.
[546:42.57]Greetings from Denmark.
[546:43.99]Greetings from Las Vegas.
[546:44.99]Viva Las Vegas.
[546:47.05]Viva Denmark.
[546:48.49]Viva Las Denmark.
[546:50.57]Both of them.
[546:51.47]Both those places.
[546:52.13]Thank you.
[546:57.99]Thank you for the 10 bucks, though, Crazy Burger.
[546:59.63]I really appreciate it.
[547:01.99]And hello.
[547:03.21]Sorry you stayed up so late.
[547:05.85]Hopefully you get some sleep.
[547:09.65]Hey!
[547:11.11]Flugboy!
[547:13.55]Flugboy, Anonymous, and Balla Koala gave $50 back-to-back-to-back here during the, uh, the Please Stop Pretend Meltdown.
[547:25.08]Thanks to the three of you.
[547:28.06]Don Dingle gave five community subs.
[547:29.84]I think I missed it during that, but thank you, Don Dingle, if you're still here.
[547:35.56]I did a fucking $50 joke and I'm proud of it.
[547:39.02]Hope your days have been well, friend.
[547:41.18]I also seem to have taken the first napkin.
[547:45.14]Napkin?
[547:49.10]Taken the first napkin?
[547:50.40]I don't know what that means.
[547:56.41]There's a JoJo reference.
[547:58.19]Oh.
[548:06.02]Thank you, I... Thank you... Thank you, Sniff, for the $2.50.
[548:10.70]When's the next anime?
[548:12.71]Alright, thanks for the $2.50.
[548:15.73]Really appreciate that.
[548:16.73]Thanks for the $2.50.
[548:17.97]Appreciate it.
[548:19.51]Uh, thank you to... Anonymous gave five community subs.
[548:34.81]I missed that.
[548:35.45]Well, I also missed Dr. McNinja.
[548:37.92]Gave five community subs as well.
[548:40.46]Not even 20 minutes ago.
[548:41.96]Thank you, Doctor.
[548:47.77]And speaking of community subs, let's get them on the screen.
[548:51.29]Why not?
[548:53.32]Why not, right?
[548:55.50]These are gonna get cut off, unfortunately, because of... Look at how fast these are going, and the first, like, two hours of them have been cut off.
[549:03.25]Annoying, because this has happened the last few streams somehow, for some reason, and I don't know why.
[549:08.81]This is new.
[549:11.63]Usually we drop a shitload of frames, or the internet will turn off.
[549:16.34]But what's been happening recently is this weird stream completely just disconnects 100%, and I'm still on the internet.
[549:26.06]That happened once tonight.
[549:29.04]And this weird, like, going to zero and coming back, but, like, the internet's not completely off.
[549:36.28]I feel like the second time was not even a Cox problem.
[549:39.51]The first time, I think, was, because the house's internet was off.
[549:42.87]But the second time, I was still online.
[549:44.61]I was talking in chat.
[549:46.59]This is a new problem.
[549:48.96]We're not dropping a shitload of frames anymore.
[549:52.24]The stream's just turning off, which is arguably worse.
[549:56.46]So... They're scheduled to come and do some maintenance here.
[550:01.94]Some real maintenance that has been planned for months apparently, so we'll see if that helps.
[550:09.22]Frames are still dropping?
[550:10.18]Yeah, but looking over here, there were 4600 frames dropped, or 4664, in almost seven and a half hours.
[550:20.36]That's pretty normal.
[550:22.30]Even if you have perfect internet, you're always gonna drop over the course of six to eight hours on a stream.
[550:29.09]You'll drop like at least two to four thousand frames.
[550:31.45]It'll happen.
[550:37.37]But thank you to all the subs.
[550:38.71]Everybody that's resubbing.
[550:40.05]Continue to resub.
[550:41.35]All the gift subs.
[550:44.74]You keep this channel fucking chugging along.
[550:46.70]So thank you guys.
[550:47.72]And then some.
[550:50.40]And then some.
[550:51.88]So thank you everybody.
[550:54.77]Are you going to let us know when the carnival stream is happening beforehand?
[550:57.73]Oh, yeah.
[550:59.21]Once I have a date for that, I'm going to be hyping it up like crazy.
[551:04.34]At least a month in advance.
[551:05.92]Like two or three weeks in advance at least.
[551:08.34]You will know when that day is.
[551:09.80]I'm going to have a pinned tweet about it.
[551:14.55]I will have at least three or four streams over the course of a month where we talk about it.
[551:20.73]I'll make sure it's on the Discord as a pinned message.
[551:24.59]I'll make sure that it gets on the Reddit as a pinned message.
[551:27.22]So you'll be able to find it.
[551:29.36]There'll be a command.
[551:30.24]That's right.
[551:30.64]I'll make a command for it.
[551:33.70]This stream is going to cost a lot of money.
[551:36.60]And a lot of people are going to be working on this.
[551:38.40]So I want to make sure as many people that want to see it, that want to have fun and enjoy it, are here.
[551:44.24]So I'm going to make sure it's in every single avenue.
[551:56.30]But I will give those details when they come.
[551:57.82]I don't want to...
[552:00.89]talk it up like crazy until I have a real date which should be I mean I have I literally I'm going to tomorrow um I have a meeting with the person that's producing the whole thing so I'm sure I'll have some more hard data tomorrow as well we will continue to discuss it don't worry you will know
[552:25.77]One one two one one one two II thanks in three bucks.
[552:29.09]Hey Jerma yesterday was my birthday.
[552:30.41]Do you eat ass?
[552:32.05]Happy birthday Happy birthday one one one two Thank you to demons V for the three dollars and 33 cents really appreciate when streamers don't yell I like to zone out a bit while I watch I'm a yeller.
[552:48.71]I'm a screamer.
[552:49.37]I'm a noise maker.
[552:50.31]I
[552:58.99]It happens sometimes.
[553:00.09]Hopefully you're not asleep.
[553:03.12]Thank you YesIsOnline for the $5.
[553:05.12]I'm very drunk right now, but thanks for showing my green screen video when I remixed The Shining.
[553:10.44]I couldn't make this in time for the encore night, so I'm going to send it through here.
[553:25.09]Let's put it up.
[553:26.79]So for the future green screen videos, I think I'm going to have a system where... Because I know there's a lot of them that have still been made.
[553:37.08]And people are still using it.
[553:38.30]And instead of doing another night... I don't think I'm going to do another green screen night.
[553:49.27]So what will probably end up happening is...
[553:52.85]I think maybe a channel in the Discord might be interesting.
[553:57.00]To have just a spot for people to put videos.
[554:03.30]And for anybody to enjoy them.
[554:04.52]And obviously that Discord is moderated so you can't put up any like just junk.
[554:10.45]Like just crap that's not appropriate.
[554:12.55]You know, it's not going to happen.
[554:17.47]But because of how many people continue to make green screen stuff.
[554:24.75]It might be worth having some other avenue.
[554:26.65]Like another playlist or something, or another channel or something eventually.
[554:30.51]Let me get this loaded.
[554:40.92]And, but, uh, we have... Uh, 250 from, uh, Sniff.
[554:47.23]Thanks, uh, when's the next anime stream?
[554:49.21]Because I'm not, I don't just, I don't plan anime streams.
[554:54.56]It's just if the game is good and I want to play it, there's no like anime planned anime streams.
[555:01.48]Look, you play one game where there's an anime character on there.
[555:06.37]50% of people think you're just an anime streamer now.
[555:08.69]And 50% are like, oh, so happy that you're an anime streamer now.
[555:15.61]Can't I just play a video game that I like that it's about selling toys?
[555:25.19]an anime.
[555:28.23]I'm glad you don't say it like anime.
[555:30.29]Anime?
[555:31.99]Anime.
[555:35.55]Isn't it anime?
[555:37.79]Anime?
[555:42.30]Well, this is going to play us out here.
[555:44.32]This is a potential VOD muter.
[555:55.85]This is, uh, Jerma's Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
[555:58.23]This is Jerma95 and Kanye West.
[556:07.16]The E is silent.
[556:13.14]What are you talking about?
[556:18.74]Vaude Butte.
[556:19.58]Is this, is this a, is this a fall song?
[556:22.34]Should I just like play bits of this and then put it in the chat?
[556:26.48]Is this gonna kill the whole- this is like a- is this the whole song?
[556:38.68]What's the best Kanye album?
[556:44.60]What a dumb question.
[556:45.86]That's a true chat fucking answer.
[556:48.20]I've actually never really listened to a Kanye album before.
[556:52.30]I- I haven't, but I don't- I haven't listened to Kanye.
[556:55.30]What the fuck is this?
[556:57.88]Do you eat ass?
[556:59.10]What are you talking about?
[557:00.54]That's your question?
[557:31.51]That's a piano!
[559:02.78]That's true, this- Wait, how do I get a pair of pants that's gonna fit this thing?

[559:12.43]5'9".
[559:15.51]Like, how do I get a pair of pants that's gonna fit this thing?
[559:23.10]I actually said that.
[559:28.45]Was I shitfaced?
[559:52.90]Oh, there's more.
[559:53.36]Hold on.
[559:55.01]This is bullshit.
[559:56.89]This is not even real.
[559:57.65]This is fake.
[559:58.13]This is a fake-like outro card because there's more.
[560:00.05]No, it is.
[560:12.84]That's it.
[560:15.02]I thought it was a fake outro card.
[560:20.82]I forgot YouTube has like this stuff that you can do.
[560:22.56]Alright, right.
[560:23.64]Oh, that was fucking hilarious.
[560:24.60]Thank you.
[560:25.76]That was awesome.
[560:35.63]Good show, good show, good show.
[560:42.83]Let's also pull up the bits that may have crashed from earlier.
[560:49.07]Let's see.
[560:55.53]Let's pull up those bits.
[561:00.47]Because the screen did turn off.
[561:02.23]Let's see if I can pull them from earlier.
[561:06.33]Hey, I got them.
[561:09.76]Or do I not?

[561:20.88]Yeah, the mustard side has the same ones.
[561:24.33]+2, -2 analytics?
[561:25.69]Do we have... Is there a chart that's made?
[561:30.33]Do we have any +2, -2 analytics?
[561:39.36]That's a pretty high score.
[561:42.36]I don't think it's been charted, but that's a high score.
[561:46.32]Looks like I got... Yeah, I got... They're all up to date.
[561:48.94]According to the other site.
[561:55.01]That's a pretty good one!
[561:57.17]Let's drop it.
[561:57.83]No, no, no, I'm gonna turn the stream up before you drop it.
[562:06.82]But, uh, no, that's that.
[562:07.80]That's it.
