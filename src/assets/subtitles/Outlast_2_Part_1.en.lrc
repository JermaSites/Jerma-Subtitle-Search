[01:42.95]I hope so.

[01:46.31]I wonder if I set this all up correctly.
[01:49.52]Probably not.
[01:52.34]Probably not.
[01:53.14]I'm on a new OBS.
[01:53.88]I'm on a new open broadcaster software.
[01:57.26]You know, there's a lot of things that I have to do.
[02:00.82]Streaming is hard.
[02:03.04]Streaming is a hard thing.
[02:04.90]Figuring out all the buttons and all the doodads and all the gizmos and goobabs is hard.
[02:12.70]Anyways.

[02:36.92]I know how to build them.
[02:37.96]I'm smart.
[02:40.40]I'm an intelligent person.
[02:44.78]But anyways, uh, we're gonna play Outlast 2 with a face cam, with an, by the way, this is an ugly face cam.

[04:20.61]This might be like an OBS Studio thing with my microphone.
[04:23.07]How about... How about now?
[04:26.53]How about now?
[04:27.35]Have we solved the issue?
[04:29.59]Probably not.

[04:34.00]You know what I mean?
[04:36.18]And it's peaking.
[04:37.00]This is a brand new computer.
[04:39.02]This might take... I thought I had it right, but... I'm trying...
[04:46.69]Now I'm too quiet.
[04:47.51]Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
[04:51.47]There's nothing I can do about it because the Scarlett Solo box is a pile of garbage.
[04:57.84]You know how sometimes we talk about products that you should never buy on stream?
[05:03.60]Alright, let's talk about products that you should never purchase ever for any reason on stream, Jerma985.
[05:09.28]Don't ever purchase a Scarlett Solo.
[05:13.16]Ever.
[05:13.98]In your whole life.
[05:15.99]If you get a Scarlet Solo, you made a bad decision.
[05:19.82]Don't do it.
[05:24.98]It sounds like I'm behind you.
[05:26.60]What?
[05:27.94]What the fuck?
[05:29.04]Alright, let's just turn this off.
[05:31.09]Let's turn on fucking ugly cam.

[05:37.33]Look at my hair.
[05:37.93]I didn't comb my hair today.
[05:41.90]Not one of those good handsome boy days.
[05:46.94]But anyways, hopefully you can hear me.
[05:48.44]Hopefully it's not too bad.
[05:50.49]I'll have to adjust.
[05:51.85]Let me move some stuff.
[05:52.49]Hold on one second.
[05:53.07]Let me just move some... Products you should never purchase.
[06:04.72]Every game I've shown in the last like two weeks.
[06:07.36]Yeah, well, I mean, come on.
[06:08.96]We're doing funny, funny, scary Saturdays.
[06:12.87]I'm gonna move this.
[06:13.81]So, yeah, sorry if you came to see, like, a handsome streamer.
[06:18.01]This is not the guy you're looking for right now.
[06:19.82]Hold on, let me actually do something.
[06:24.68]Let me, like, change the lighting.
[06:26.36]My light's, like, not correct right now.
[06:30.12]This is not correct.
[06:31.98]I'm gonna go with, like, a different scene here.
[06:33.74]Let's go with, uh... What do you guys think?
[06:36.22]We're playing a scary game, obviously, right?
[06:37.82]So we're gonna have to do something like, uh...
[06:41.73]Oh, I kind of like that.
[06:42.89]That's like a little scary.
[06:44.19]That's kind of scary, don't you think?
[06:47.23]Let's make it a little, let's change, huh?
[06:50.73]But now this is just like every movie that's come out, like digitally filmed in the last 10 years.
[06:55.29]What about Deep Sea?
[06:58.99]I kind of like Deep Sea.
[07:00.35]Should I stay on Deep?
[07:01.26]No, this looks like I'm just in a fucking ultraviolet light room.
[07:08.44]What about this one?
[07:11.29]Uh, no.
[07:11.93]What about this one?
[07:14.09]Uh, no, that's not gonna match the theme.
[07:15.69]We'll go with the one we had before, this one.
[07:21.89]Make it flicker?
[07:22.67]Alright, we'll go with this one.
[07:25.93]I like this one for now.
[07:26.93]I look like a fucking Satan man, you know what I mean?
[07:29.09]Like, makes my teeth look fake.
[07:35.42]Alright, we're gonna stay with this one.
[07:36.46]We're gonna stay with, like, the scary face.
[07:38.70]For now.
[07:41.01]Is that too much?
[07:42.77]We'll find out.
[07:44.45]See you soon.
[07:46.77]We got a Satan face filter on right now.
[07:48.41]All right.
[07:49.51]Outlast 2.
[07:49.99]I do need to give a little bit of a warning here.
[07:53.04]We're going to have to give a little bit of a fucking FBI CIA warning here.
[07:57.00]This is a very, very intense game.
[08:01.94]It's very scary.
[08:03.06]It's a very fucked up subject matter.
[08:05.12]So, you know, I'll give it to you in a diagram.
[08:09.47]So let me get this up.
[08:10.35]Hold on.
[08:13.15]hold on okie dokie hold on hold on that comes up this comes down
[08:21.93]Okay.
[08:23.40]You can hear that, right?
[08:24.62]That sounds okay?
[08:26.02]If it needs to be a little louder, let me know.
[08:27.78]Please do.
[08:29.18]So yes, this game has some very, very, very, very intense subject matter.
[08:34.87]So this is not for the faint of heart.
[08:36.41]This is literally like my warning to you.
[08:38.37]If you're under the age of 16, if you can't see an R-rated movie in the United States...
[08:48.28]I'm sorry, you're gonna have to tell your parents.
[08:50.56]So, like, just be aware.
[08:52.70]This is not one of those, like, fun, funny games.
[08:54.82]This is gonna be fucked up.
[08:56.15]Everything about this game is fucked up.
[08:58.43]So, let me just do this.
[09:00.65]This is not PG-13 at all.
[09:02.79]This is PG-18.
[09:06.85]So, you guys are currently watching a PG-18 stream.
[09:12.26]This is a terrifying, awful fucking game.
[09:15.66]And what we're going to do, this is the straight face challenge.
[09:18.06]Let me change, let me get rid of that, by the way.
[09:19.62]I don't need to say that anymore.
[09:20.54]I don't even know what a straight face challenge means, but, you know.
[09:24.66]You can take away the 8 p.m.
[09:26.14]Eastern time nonsense.
[09:29.03]Okay.
[09:30.19]So the goal here is I'm going to be a straight face.
[09:32.19]No jump backs, no scares, no woos.
[09:34.47]You know what I mean?
[09:34.99]Because I am known to woo.

[10:29.43]I already said it before.
[10:30.35]If you're under the age of fucking 18, under the age of 17, you can't watch an R-rated movie in the United States of America.
[10:35.83]Peggy 16, you know what I mean?

[12:24.89]I might have to turn on V-Sync.
[12:26.33]This is kind of a little too Terry for me.
[12:28.69]Turn the game off.
[12:29.37]We should record an intro while we're up here.
[12:49.19]Uh... Okay.
[12:52.39]Nice Judge Doom hair.

[13:06.96]Oh, wait.
[13:16.82]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[13:18.14]My look sensitivity has got to drop way down.
[13:20.84]Put this up a little.
[13:23.74]And I am going to NVIDIA G-Sync this.
[13:27.13]Hopefully this doesn't fuck up anything.

[13:43.45]I'm Lynn Langerman, here for Newstomorrow.net.
[13:47.13]We're flying past the Havasupai Indian Reservation in central Arizona in search of the origins of murder victim Joe Doe.
[13:53.73]Hey, Lynn, I don't think you should say murdered.
[13:56.59]Don't say murdered.
[13:57.57]Oh, I'll say she strangled herself to death.
[13:59.25]That's what the police report says.
[14:01.17]Supercomputer, all settings on medium.
[14:02.89]I'm streaming, too.
[14:04.37]I gotta make sure I can stream.
[14:05.69]How does the stream look, by the way?
[14:06.83]We look good?
[14:09.21]I got this shit on, like, medium, like, preset on Twitch, which, holy shit, you don't do medium preset.
[14:15.70]Wait, what am I filming?
[14:18.04]Am I doing a good job?
[14:19.42]That's allowed.
[14:20.50]That's allowed.
[14:21.62]That's allowed.
[14:46.35]Okay.
[14:49.33]Here's the intro.

[15:21.13]First place.
[15:22.41]Yep.
[15:25.87]Look at that, like, wicked old little kid.
[15:28.89]Why is that little kid, like, 50 years old?
[15:32.46]Hey, thank you, uh, cigarette spaghetti.
[15:34.90]That is not in the right spot.
[15:36.76]Hold on.
[15:39.49]Hold on.
[15:40.33]Alright, that should be in the right spot now.
[15:42.50]Anyways, thank you so much to... Cigarette Spaghetti for the 10 bucks.
[15:46.52]10 dollarinos for both headphones.
[15:49.08]Okay, I see what you did there.
[15:51.02]Alright, we'll put both headphones in.
[15:53.32]Thank you for the 10 dollars, dude.
[15:55.20]Cigarette Spaghetti.
[15:56.32]Also, thank you to Matter of Darkness for 5 bucks.
[15:58.98]Please don't tell my parents.
[16:00.65]Here's a bribe.
[16:01.35]Hey, look, I'm just saying, if you're under the age of 17...
[16:09.76]What's your name again?
[16:11.76]Matters of darkness.
[16:12.51]Okay.
[16:13.39]Interesting.
[16:14.17]Okay.
[16:14.49]Let's see.
[16:21.38]Hello, yes, I'm looking for matters.
[16:23.06]That's not funny.
[16:23.94]That's not even funny.
[16:24.86]You know, when I was about to do that, I was going to call somebody.
[16:27.16]That wasn't even, like, funny.
[16:28.38]That was just, like, shitty.
[16:30.00]I'm sorry.
[16:30.44]That was awful.
[16:30.96]I was going to, like, pretend to call your mother.
[16:33.74]Oh, fucking hilarious.
[16:35.24]Let's go with the other joke I was going with.
[16:36.54]Hey, look at this.
[16:37.35]Look at, like, George Bush when he was, like, fucking nine years old.
[16:39.81]Isn't that funny?
[16:41.73]Anyways, I thank you, Matters of Darkness, for the five bucks.
[16:45.31]And Sticks Renegade, thank you for the $13.68.
[16:48.11]Watch this, German.
[16:48.63]You can make a religion out of this.
[16:51.28]I don't think I could ever make a religion out of myself.
[16:53.02]I really don't.
[16:53.48]I'm sorry.
[16:55.92]Okay, let's go.
[16:57.10]It's a picture of a Christian symbol of Christ, Jesus Christ, on the... And there's the scary principal.
[17:05.58]He's going to turn around and be like, You were supposed to be in class!
[17:07.98]Stop making... You know, I'm doing this because I'm scared.
[17:12.45]He's going to turn around and rip around.
[17:13.39]He's going to be Satan face right in my face.
[17:14.99]He's going to be like, You get to class!
[17:16.29]Go!
[17:19.01]Times it.
[17:19.33]This is how you can tell when shit's gonna go down.
[17:20.83]It's fucking 6.15, right?
[17:21.97]6.10?
[17:22.03]Yep.
[17:23.05]Remember that.
[17:23.35]We're gonna need that for the fucking safe later on.
[17:29.62]I'm gonna turn around.
[17:42.07]I'm gonna turn around.
[17:43.41]And there's gonna be a Satan face.
[17:56.02]Rage, what?
[17:58.96]I feel like I'm trapped when I have two headphones in.
[18:04.93]German will never acknowledge a quarter.
[18:06.41]Well, HollywoodSN202, I just did.
[18:07.89]What are you going to do about that one, huh?
[18:10.83]Thank you.
[18:12.13]I thank you, Blackstaff, for the five bucks.
[18:13.99]Streamer, this angle and lighting makes you look like Willem Dafoe.
[18:19.29]Willem Dafoe is a fucking handsome guy, isn't he?
[18:22.75]I could do a pretty good Green Goblin, don't you think?
[18:26.62]So, like, later on in my life, like, when I, like, get to be, like, 60, I could probably be a pretty sick Norman Osborn.
[18:31.69]I really, I really truly believe that.
[18:37.18]There's my fucking Sony digital PDHD.
[18:41.76]Fuck.
[18:44.76]Lynn?
[18:58.43]Oh.
[18:59.37]Okay.
[19:01.23]How do I pick, how do I take, how do I pick up the camera?
[19:04.27]How do I take the camera?
[19:07.05]Is it G for G-Sync camera?
[19:09.99]I have a ticket, there's a jump.
[19:11.47]Okay, I figured out the jump.
[19:23.40]I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[19:27.56]Get up.
[19:28.06]Get up.
[19:28.44]I'm not.
[19:29.04]Okay, I'm up.
[19:29.80]I just have to go here.
[19:32.08]Here.
[19:34.10]Right?
[19:34.98]Wait, maybe not.
[19:35.78]There we go.
[19:38.12]Just doing some slip sliding.
[19:41.12]Free joke?
[19:41.70]I know, that was a pretty free joke.
[19:42.90]Jump over a gap for space.
[19:44.02]Jump!
[19:45.97]Just like fucking Prince of Persia.
[19:50.77]You guys know that the devs of Prince of Persia made this game, right?
[19:54.19]That's why it's very similar.
[19:57.03]And when they were asked in interviews about how they went from Prince of Persia to making this game... The guy, the lead developer, was shit-faced.
[20:05.83]It was kind of embarrassing.
[20:08.64]He was like, just grabbed the microphone and he was just like, We wanted to make a scary game instead of a game where you jump.
[20:13.86]And I'm like, this is a very embarrassing video.
[20:16.30]Alright, oh, okay.
[20:21.20]Aim at the event until the circle is... Okay, well they made the camera much better in this one.
[20:35.94]Okay.
[20:37.64]The camera is ten times better.
[20:41.54]Review recorded videos to learn about... Wait.
[20:44.79]It actually records.
[20:46.05]Review footage?
[20:46.91]No way.
[20:48.73]Oh wow, that's so awesome.
[20:52.45]Oh my god, that's so cool.
[20:54.09]Is this actually... Does this actually fucking record what I did?
[20:59.08]Okay.
[20:59.78]That's really, really cool.
[21:01.10]I like that a lot.
[21:09.27]Wait, did I- I'm so glad this is a thing.
[21:23.98]Oh my god, look at her face.
[21:27.60]That's so great that it actually records things.
[21:32.83]I recorded you jamming the camera for notes.
[21:35.96]All right, well, whatever, we're good.
[21:44.54]I know I'm gonna get like attacked by some fucking scary guy, and I'm gonna be reviewing footage.
[21:52.14]Cigarette spaghetti, thanks again for the 10 bucks.
[21:53.54]I can't help but notice that you're only wearing one of those headphones.
[21:57.81]But I don't like it.
[21:58.61]It makes you feel like a hamster in a hamster cage.
[22:03.68]Stop stalling.
[22:04.86]It's a scary game, man.
[22:06.28]And this is so dark.
[22:08.38]Oh.
[22:10.70]Right.
[22:12.26]I remember.
[22:16.56]So I was in a helicopter crash.
[22:20.17]And that brings me to the scary canyon.
[22:34.08]I wish you could turn the camera on yourself.
[22:38.73]Okay, that's recorded.
[22:43.67]Cool.
[22:45.78]I remember about batteries, right?
[22:46.98]I gotta pick up batteries.
[22:48.34]This thing... What I remember from Outlast 1 is this thing is like a fucking Game Gear.
[22:53.46]It requires batteries every like 13 minutes.
[22:56.60]Remember Game Gear?
[22:57.16]Remember how fucked up that was?
[22:59.62]Okay, that's how you whip around quickly.
[23:04.36]The Game Gear was a great system.
[23:05.52]It was like full color, full great big bright display.
[23:09.10]But it took like 17 AA batteries.
[23:13.44]And you need to just switch those batteries out, it would drain all those batteries in 15 minutes.
[23:18.69]You ain't taking that on a plane ride from Boston to LA, that ain't gonna happen.
[23:22.87]You can barely take that on a plane ride from Boston to New York.
[23:26.47]It's like, fucking, they should have thought about that.
[23:30.13]I determine what is good for... Shut up for a second, I'm trying to fucking say something about, like, battery life.
[23:39.82]I think that battery life, I determine what is good battery life based on how long I can use it on a plane.
[23:45.28]If I can use something for like five minutes on a plane, fucking get out of here.
[23:48.40]20 minutes on a plane, no thank you.
[23:49.72]Two hours on a plane, get the fuck out of here.
[23:51.22]Go back home.
[23:52.18]Four hours on a plane, you got me.
[23:56.00]You've got me there.
[23:58.74]Wait, I should probably go in the house, huh?
[24:03.86]I'm lost and hurt.
[24:09.08]Oh no, somebody jammed it!
[24:14.39]Is the FOV... Is there an FOV slider in this game?
[24:20.67]Or is it just 90 default?
[24:22.47]I don't know.
[24:24.47]It feels like it's 90.
[24:25.90]You never know.
[24:26.32]You know, I determine how much I like a game based on if there's an FOV slider or not.
[24:36.00]If there's, like, two hours or three hours of FOV slider, then I, uh, I like it.
[24:44.35]But if you're talking about, like, less than two hours of an FOV slider, then... What?
[24:49.86]Hey, man.
[24:50.24]Who's hey, man?
[24:52.82]Photo taken.
[24:57.60]God forgive us.
[24:58.42]Okay, whatever.
[24:59.04]I can't, I'm, like, I need batteries.
[25:02.01]Remember the thing you just looked at?
[25:03.13]Here it is.
[25:06.91]I can't bear what we've done.
[25:08.57]Nor being a part of our little ones.
[25:12.52]I hope you find what woman's comfort you need.
[25:14.68]Oh, no.
[25:19.24]Okay.
[25:19.66]Well, I took the picture.
[25:20.62]And now, like, I need a battery.
[25:23.01]I can't do anything.
[25:25.13]Battery?
[25:26.17]Here we are.
[25:28.25]See how many batteries you have?
[25:29.07]Press tab.
[25:29.93]How many batteries do I have?
[25:33.31]Look at your left pocket to interact with your batteries.
[25:35.40]Oh, God.
[25:37.52]I have to look at it?
[25:38.54]I only have two batteries?
[25:40.13]You didn't come prepared, man.
[25:41.27]Alright, we're good for now.
[25:46.35]Any more batteries?
[25:51.64]God.
[25:51.94]I don't like this cult shit.
[25:53.96]Reload.
[26:02.10]Guy behind the door.
[26:02.96]No.
[26:03.34]Jan, go.
[26:03.78]Alright, let's go.
[26:05.78]Am I going the right way?
[26:07.86]There's a guy here.
[26:13.88]Oh, shit.
[26:14.24]He's like the wolf from the never-ending story.
[26:17.00]Come on, give me that reference.
[26:20.09]Pea, cold, cute.
[26:20.87]He's not gonna chase me, is he?
[26:22.65]Oh, fucking hell.
[26:26.07]Honestly.
[26:29.01]Where the hell am I supposed to go?
[26:29.97]Can I pull out the fucking Excalibur?
[26:45.06]Alright, let's try the peek.
[26:46.87]Okay, Q and E. No, straight face.
[26:57.37]We're doing the straight face challenge, guys.
[27:05.80]Alright, that fat frog guy.
[27:07.36]I thought that picture was...
[27:20.68]That's gotta be like the cult leader, right?
[27:22.56]Let me close this up and just take a look.
[27:25.99]Battery's gotta be in here, right?
[27:27.19]Oh, there's a fucking long-ass letter.
[27:33.13]Our loving God continues to bless me with visions.
[27:38.06]And I know more certain than ever that the enemy is nearer with every day.
[27:45.01]I was scrubbing the stains from the floor of the Daniels' room when the blessed music rose inside me and sank me into true sight where I saw a creature like the burning sun but with un-inward rings.
[27:59.87]Teeth upon teeth and teeth and dangling beneath the limbs that I took to be arms but were cocks that frozen childling purpose as this monstrous son.
[28:12.96]Okay, that like just threw me off big time.
[28:16.35]That threw me off a little.
[28:19.91]Just a little.
[28:26.33]Wasn't prepared for that, I will say.
[28:28.21]Hide in the little, hide in the cubby.
[28:29.43]Watch out for the fucking monster from my amnesia.
[28:33.27]Hold to peek.
[28:36.03]Who is it?
[28:37.71]Okay, whatever.
[28:38.19]Let's go.
[28:41.55]Ooh.
[28:42.65]Bandage.
[28:45.13]I can hear somebody walking over there.
[28:47.95]Nothing else in this room, I don't think.
[28:49.23]Just make sure I didn't miss anything on the bed.
[28:50.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:00.87]Let's go.
[29:08.11]Okay, record like the seahorse.
[29:12.64]Why is this so fucked up?
[29:13.82]It's just like a regular children's toy.
[29:15.96]I don't know why that's so fucked up.
[29:24.43]You never seen like a children's toy before, dude?
[29:28.80]It's okay.
[29:29.34]I can make that face.
[29:30.14]That was a straight face.
[29:31.00]That was a straight face challenge.
[29:32.20]It's okay.
[29:32.44]It's because of Aaron here.
[29:38.54]Somebody fucking fought it.
[29:39.58]That wasn't funny.
[29:43.99]I'm sorry.
[29:45.43]You've probably watched a bunch of people play this game already and they've said that already.
[29:49.99]What did that say?
[29:50.67]Some doors have deadbolts that can be what?
[30:03.84]You can hide by crawling under beds.
[30:05.92]Yeah.
[30:07.36]I do remember that.
[30:12.10]It's fine.
[30:12.82]Okay.
[30:13.14]I feel like the guy's a little slower in this one.
[30:17.81]I feel like this guy's not as fit as the first dude was.
[30:23.55]Okay, let's just go.
[30:27.63]Oh, you actually have to unlock it.
[30:28.71]Okay.
[30:31.99]Crawl through here.
[30:36.30]Three hundred Three hundred, what do you mean three hundred dollar joke?
[30:41.02]What are you talking about?
[30:42.52]Hey, good guy, Ty.
[30:43.44]Thank you for the four bucks.
[30:46.31]He says... I ain't gonna say that.
[30:49.89]Cigarette spaghetti, thank you for the ten bucks again.
[30:51.29]Okay, I'm hearing some, like, loud heartbeat noises.
[30:58.05]Alright, straight face challenge.
[30:59.31]Someone's gonna jump up and grab me and be like, Get outta here!
[31:05.79]Don't you fucking dare.
[31:19.33]Don't you fucking dare.
[31:25.09]This room's okay.
[31:30.46]Midwife's Lument!
[31:32.10]The babe is coming!
[31:37.34]I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do that shit.
[31:39.60]Reload the camera.
[31:46.69]These, like, dolls are really freaking me out.
[31:55.36]What in the fuck is that?
[31:58.06]Oh, God.
[32:05.58]Is this like if you turn the camera off and on too much it uses more battery power?
[32:09.42]Gotta record that.
[32:15.65]I need to look out for batteries.
[32:20.63]They're everywhere.
[32:21.39]I haven't been doing it.
[32:22.89]Proceed to crawl.
[32:38.53]Don't read Latin.
[32:39.85]Yeah, if I read Latin, then the demon's actually gonna show up.
[32:45.19]Just broken down house, that's okay.
[32:46.87]Whatever, I don't need- I'm gonna turn it off for now.
[32:48.71]I'm gonna conserve battery.
[32:59.46]Yeah?
[33:03.28]You're doing the default scary voice, that means you're a bad person.
[33:10.17]Anytime somebody does the default scary lady voice, that means that they're gonna be a fucking demon.
[33:20.16]How do I kindle the flame?
[33:21.24]Come on, where's my Dark Souls joke?
[33:23.40]Where's my bonfire?
[33:24.46]Come on.
[33:31.28]Save the game.
[33:35.82]Whoa, there's a lady there.
[33:38.87]Oh, she's gone now.
[33:39.54]She's gone.
[33:42.98]What?
[33:47.86]She just doesn't... Alright, go.
[33:49.22]Whatever.
[33:49.56]Who cares?
[33:53.25]Don't open.
[33:57.51]Window.
[33:57.97]Get in there.
[34:02.02]Bandages.
[34:07.98]Battery.
[34:08.44]Grab it.
[34:08.86]Come on.
[34:11.83]Weird clock.
[34:13.13]Okay, let's live.
[34:14.45]Let's live.
[34:16.59]Oh, it's time to live.
[34:19.03]No woes.
[34:19.51]That was a very silent woe.
[34:29.51]Can't get in there.
[34:31.77]Can crawl into that, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any fucking Satan.
[34:36.33]Okay, we're good.
[34:56.80]That doesn't count.
[34:57.88]That wasn't straight.
[34:58.58]I'm allowed to do that.
[35:04.01]That was so quiet.
[35:05.23]That was a very quiet, low face.
[35:09.59]Oh man, that was like... That was a straight face!
[35:13.35]I didn't- that- I didn't fuck around there, guys.
[35:21.53]Now what?
[35:21.87]Can I like jump to this?
[35:25.27]Oh, come on.
[35:26.29]What do I do here?
[35:29.01]Okay, yeah.
[35:38.60]Straight faces only.
[35:41.64]Videotaper, quick!
[36:09.11]God wants me dead?
[36:11.01]Okay.
[36:16.96]This is just like Fatal Frame.
[36:18.30]They're scared of the videotape.
[36:22.82]Where am I supposed to go?
[36:26.78]Damn it.
[36:35.05]I guess I have to go over here.
[36:40.48]I gotta, like, remember this shit.
[36:45.69]What is it?
[36:46.13]What is it?
[36:46.49]You see that prompt?
[36:47.97]What's with the prompt?
[36:51.37]Why is it giving me that prompt?
[36:53.95]Batteries?
[36:56.07]Goddammit, that crazy fucking lady is out here.
[36:58.25]Oh my god.
[37:03.26]Why am I crawling?
[37:04.40]Get up.
[37:06.40]Get up!
[37:10.58]Let me just be Oscar the Grouch for a few minutes.
[37:15.92]That's so funny.
[37:17.58]Hey!
[37:18.94]Get lost, will ya?
[37:21.74]Oscar, why are you so mean?
[37:23.22]Alright, this is your Oscar the Grouch joke.
[37:35.67]Hide and waste high plants, okay.
[37:44.58]Where the fuck am I supposed to be going right now?
[37:47.70]I have no indication.
[37:48.58]Your camera is equipped with a microphone.
[37:51.12]Press V to hear through walls?
[38:04.41]Straight face.
[38:13.50]Where are these guys?
[38:14.52]They're like right over here.
[38:15.32]I have no idea.
[38:18.44]I don't have a single clue.
[38:24.20]Hello.
[38:24.46]Hey, it gets scary.
[38:29.06]I don't want to get scared.
[38:34.58]Move backward to open door slowly.
[38:38.96]There's gonna be like three guys right here.
[38:43.79]I can see you.
[38:44.43]I can like see you doing that.
[38:46.33]I can like feel you doing that.
[38:47.63]You're not gonna get me doing that.
[38:48.91]I tried.
[38:53.31]Yeah, I can like see your shadow.
[38:54.55]You're doing like puppetry over my shoulder.
[38:57.21]I can like see... Oh god, hold on.
[38:58.55]Okay, there's a guy just sitting there.
[39:12.54]Do I have to go by this guy?
[39:13.62]Alright, so I can go in like the grass, right?
[39:19.61]If I go like this?
[39:24.89]Wouldn't you see this guy doing this?
[39:29.11]I'm just like, what is this, Hitman?
[39:30.67]I'm like creeping up on this guy.
[39:31.91]Alright, take the camera off.
[39:36.38]Oh, shit.
[39:38.04]Alright, the goal is straight through that door, right?
[39:47.81]I don't know.
[39:48.81]Like, I'm assuming I gotta go like that way, right?
[39:50.93]Can I run that way?
[39:54.39]Fuck it.
[39:59.34]Open up the window.
[40:00.00]No.
[40:12.16]What the fuck was that?
[40:18.80]What is this?
[40:27.35]Please try to be as strong as... I don't care.
[40:29.77]Who cares?
[40:30.31]There's like scary, crazy people right here.
[40:32.95]This is Resident Evil 4 all over again.
[40:37.45]Do you know what God said?
[40:42.95]Can I come in the front door?
[41:13.19]Oh, that's my wife.
[41:15.43]Fuck.
[41:24.24]How do I jump the fence?
[41:29.70]Wait, crawl underneath.
[41:31.32]They didn't think that through.
[41:32.72]Fuck.
[41:34.28]Uh, I guess I have to find a little way.
[41:38.22]Oh, look.
[41:38.80]That's real great security you got here.
[41:42.08]Make sure you bolt the gate closed, but fuck the giant doggy door.
[41:48.42]Don't make that, like, hard to get through.
[41:50.00]I have a Rottweiler that has to take shits, you know.
[41:55.50]Let me look around for a second.
[42:00.50]How many batteries do I have?
[42:02.38]I don't know.
[42:04.46]Let me fucking turn the light up.
[42:09.03]Whatever.
[42:14.07]I can't go in that door.
[42:16.07]Cool.
[42:17.11]Got it.
[42:42.57]Alright, now they're all gonna use the bathroom and shit.
[42:44.77]There he is!
[42:45.97]That's the main bad guy.
[42:47.25]I mean, it's pretty obvious.
[42:54.18]Now we're going to the wine cellar.
[42:56.52]A place I don't necessarily want to be.
[42:59.36]But we are playing Outlast 2, so we have to do it.
[43:03.20]Carpet.
[43:05.42]Almost just spoke the Latin.
[43:07.26]Almost just spoke the Latin there.
[43:08.52]That would've been bad.
[43:10.06]That would've been not good.
[43:13.32]Why am I like the dungeon?
[43:22.60]What is this?
[43:23.06]Oh, key.
[43:23.40]Tab.
[43:23.97]Look at your pocket to use bin.
[43:25.51]Okay, I got a key, but what's the key for?
[43:29.19]I love the enemy.
[43:43.97]Did I show you this magic trick?
[43:48.58]Look at this!
[43:50.60]See, the pen is here!
[43:52.32]And now the pen's not here anymore!
[43:54.40]I just wanted to make sure I show you that magic trick before we go further on in our playthrough.
[43:59.01]There's just a little magic trick I wanted to show you.
[44:01.51]Didn't get, like, fucking scared.
[44:02.83]It's just a magic trick.
[44:09.23]Okay.
[44:13.89]All right.
[44:22.24]We're upstairs now where this guy drinks a lot of booze.
[44:25.04]You know, this guy drinks a lot of booze.
[44:29.54]Oh, a battery.
[44:32.86]You believe me?
[44:33.64]Good.
[44:34.30]I'm glad somebody fucking believes me.
[44:38.41]What's in the fridge?
[44:38.99]Anything good?
[44:43.91]Up the stairs?
[44:44.37]No, it's a jam.
[44:45.01]Up the stairs.
[44:52.02]There sure are a lot of pictures that you can hide by entering a wardrobe.
[44:55.22]It'd be so funny if I could change clothes.
[44:58.64]I thought there was a guy in here.
[45:05.91]I really thought there was a guy standing in there.
[45:08.23]That would have been fucking so funny.
[45:14.58]Gospel.
[45:15.14]Alright, so this is obviously like a religious... What's that?
[45:19.53]What's that resolution?
[45:23.59]1920x1080, 50 megabytes per second.
[45:26.20]Megabits per second.
[45:26.90]That's fucking pretty good.
[45:29.88]Camera has been upgraded in the years since Outlast 1.
[45:42.33]That door don't open.
[45:43.39]Wait, hold on.
[45:43.89]I can see in there.
[45:44.85]Get it on film.
[45:45.60]Whatever it is, get it on video.
[45:56.25]It's a guy like practicing for his play he's gonna be in.
[46:02.17]Okay, well let's go.
[46:05.85]Someone's gonna grab me.
[46:07.92]I know it.
[46:10.02]Yeah, here it comes.
[46:11.12]Straight face.
[46:12.12]Nothing, nothing, nothing to see here.
[46:19.56]Hey, that was not smart.
[46:21.68]I'm coming!
[46:24.68]Alright, I'm here.
[46:27.80]I'm here, Lynn.
[46:30.98]Don't worry, you're gonna be face.
[46:32.59]You're gonna be face.
[46:34.65]Oh shit, look out, the Wicked Witch of the West is gonna come after us.
[46:47.21]We're good.
[46:51.66]Anywhere but here.
[46:52.52]I agree.
[46:56.78]Wait, wait, wait.
[46:58.46]Are we holding hands?
[46:59.42]Good.
[47:03.29]They impregnated her with Satan, baby, right?
[47:06.69]Oh, no.
[47:06.83]No.
[47:13.55]This is, no, don't, don't have, like, her, like, aliens, too, have, like, her stomach burst open and, like, a Satan alien man comes out.
[47:20.53]That's gonna happen, isn't it?
[47:21.39]I have to stop.
[47:23.39]I just, I need help.
[47:25.15]Oh, God.
[47:26.13]How do you take a picture?
[47:27.13]Jesus Christ, man.
[47:27.63]You can take pictures?
[47:29.30]What's happening here?
[47:29.90]What's the picture button?
[47:30.50]You're dead.
[47:32.10]When you fell, I thought we were all dead.
[47:35.42]It's okay.
[47:36.18]How do I take a picture?
[47:37.84]We're gonna get out of here, okay?
[47:40.83]I'm telling you, this is fucking... This is fucked up.
[47:44.97]Who's this guy vlogging everything?
[47:47.35]Yeah, why would I be holding the camera, by the way, right now?
[47:50.87]Why am I doing, like, a YouTube vlog?
[48:10.88]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[48:11.96]It's your boy here, Jerma985.
[48:13.84]We just got kidnapped and abducted and tortured by this crazy religious cult.
[48:19.85]It was a really weird day today.
[48:21.21]Oh, by the way, I had some spicy food.
[48:23.47]I don't really like spicy food.
[48:24.61]I'm not a spicy food kind of guy, you know?
[48:29.57]And, oh my god, my mother's coming over later this afternoon.
[48:33.67]Fuck, cringe!
[48:39.25]I'm wasting battery.
[48:48.58]I'm like, oh, dude, crazy fucking thing happened to me today.
[48:51.80]These guys, like, murdered my girlfriend on camera.
[48:55.40]Like, it's so weird.
[48:57.18]God, man, so, I cannot stand this when stuff like this happens to me.
[49:00.83]I missed the bus today.
[49:02.09]I missed the bus.
[49:04.27]Wow.
[49:04.89]And, like, I was late to work by 20 minutes.
[49:10.10]YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!
[49:11.75]GET OFF ME!
[49:12.47]YOU LEAVE HER ALONE!
[49:13.61]LEAVE HER ALONE!
[49:15.35]LEAD!
[49:15.61]LEAD!
[49:16.17]FUCK YOU!
[49:42.54]I've watched my father fuck your god to death.
[49:48.01]Blake!
[49:52.89]Blake!
[49:53.43]Uh, shh.
[49:54.17]Man, no!
[49:54.99]Wait!
[49:55.71]No, wait!
[49:59.80]No!
[50:00.46]No!
[50:01.26]For fuck's sake!
[50:04.04]Take her home.
[50:06.02]I want to share my love with the Father.
[50:12.23]Motherfucker!
[50:20.83]God doesn't love you.
[50:23.15]Not like I do.
[50:31.54]Yes, my love.
[50:33.99]Well, we have met.
[50:41.66]I think I'll see you again.
[51:08.64]What's wrong with her?
[51:19.89]Oh, that's not even her.
[51:24.03]Hey, by the way, something to note here.
[51:27.19]It's not just the cult.
[51:30.09]If you're watching the VOD right now, I want you to just go back and watch.
[51:34.98]Or if you remember watching.
[51:36.66]There was like a fucking Muppet holding my right leg.
[51:39.24]There was like some weird Muppet person.
[51:42.30]It was like a creature holding my leg.
[51:45.52]What the fuck was that?
[51:49.23]It's going back in.
[51:51.19]Don't worry.
[51:54.78]It's in.
[51:55.54]It's in.
[51:55.90]Don't worry.
[51:56.52]We're good.
[51:57.90]So where do I have to go?
[52:02.31]Take a battery.
[52:05.55]You ain't slick.
[52:07.47]Thank you, cigarette spaghetti.
[52:09.41]I ain't slick slick.
[52:12.49]Oh, God.
[52:13.35]Hide in the bush, right?
[52:14.79]Is this good enough?
[52:16.72]Is this like... This has to be good enough, right?
[52:20.58]It ain't good enough.
[52:28.91]I love this rear view mirror though.
[52:33.35]Heal.
[52:34.05]What?
[52:34.37]Give me the flashlight.
[52:35.15]Why can't I take the fucking flashlight?
[52:52.90]Hide by crouching underwater.
[52:58.99]They're just like bees.
[52:59.81]They can't go in water.
[53:00.63]I think I'm good.
[53:21.48]Okay, I'm good.
[53:24.56]Bandage it up.
[53:26.26]Time to drown.
[53:26.82]I'm not gonna drown.
[53:30.25]Oh, god damn it.
[53:36.66]Where do I have to go?
[53:38.40]Did I, like, go the... Ah, I don't even know, guys.
[53:41.00]I, like, got turned around.
[53:41.96]I'm not even sure.
[53:42.38]Am I going the right way?
[53:43.06]I got a feeling I have to go up there, up in, like, to fucking the treehouse.
[53:59.96]Do I have to go to the treehouse?
[54:05.32]Damn it.
[54:05.84]This is fucking fantastic.
[54:17.87]Open this up.
[54:23.83]I can't open this window?
[54:24.65]What the fuck?
[54:25.18]Are you serious?
[54:26.70]Why?
[54:31.27]Slowly.
[54:37.15]Close this shit up.
[54:42.72]Nothing, nothing.
[54:43.52]Dude, how do you not have any batteries in your room?
[54:47.91]I hear a loud violin.
[54:49.67]That means somebody's coming.
[55:10.81]You understand?
[55:11.67]They keep doing the music cue.
[55:13.03]Alright, let's go.
[55:22.62]No, don't lock the door.
[55:23.68]Unlock it.
[55:39.80]Alright, I can go.
[55:41.08]Battery right there.
[55:46.14]I'm late.
[55:46.58]How is this a cowboy game?
[55:48.54]We postponed Western Week.
[55:52.14]Because my new PC... My old PC got all fucked up.
[55:57.50]And I had to get... Is he sleeping or is he dead?
[56:00.32]I don't know.
[56:01.80]I don't want to stick around to find out.
[56:04.97]This guy's like so... This guy's so asleep that flies came in here and like have been sleeping on him and like eating him and stuff.
[56:11.82]Like dude, you might want to wake up.
[56:13.24]There are currently... And I'm just fucking sitting here recording for no reason.
[56:18.60]Like you are so tired and you smell so bad that flies are coming in here, dude.
[56:24.17]Get with the program.
[56:27.39]Batteries.
[56:44.80]God damn it.
[56:48.15]I think I only have one battery right now.
[56:49.73]This is no good.
[57:03.02]And here we are back at like the school.
[57:11.88]Why do I keep getting, like, transported, like, to the school?
[57:17.41]I'm telling you, that weird principal is gonna... Okay, get out of the... You can't walk over... You're a grown fucking man.
[57:22.47]You can't get over a desk.
[57:26.49]Honest to God?
[57:27.15]Really?
[57:29.87]Teacher always has to carry batteries.
[57:31.65]It's a teacher law.
[57:32.93]No, apparently not.
[57:33.83]Okay, well, whatever.
[57:40.71]Jesus Christ.
[57:49.72]I'm sorry I have to do this.
[57:52.10]You should have loved me.
[57:53.56]You should have helped me.
[57:55.04]Oh, he's reading it.
[57:56.08]I thought he was just saying these things.
[57:58.66]I'm so, so sorry, Jessica.
[58:01.08]Videotape it.
[58:03.32]Honestly, how long does it take for you to film this?
[58:11.30]Like, I already got it.
[58:12.28]I can move on.
[58:14.46]I can move on now.
[58:15.26]I don't have to, like, sit here this whole time.
[58:17.85]Watch, here we go.
[58:20.53]Pick it up.
[58:23.05]Okay, watch.
[58:27.73]Look at that scary motherfucker.
[58:30.71]Wait, I'm back in the fourth grade?
[58:37.98]Oh man, back in the fourth grade.
[58:40.40]This can't get any worse.
[58:41.52]Why is this turning into a goofy Disney comedy?
[58:45.27]Man, I'm back at my fourth grade self.
[58:46.91]Crazy!
[58:47.53]Open the door.
[58:55.08]Okay, well, that was weird.
[59:04.18]What's that?
[59:04.98]There's somebody sitting on the... There's somebody sitting right there.
[59:13.02]You're on camera.
[59:13.56]If you do anything bad, I'm gonna put it on the internet.
[59:26.01]Do you know how this works?
[59:28.45]You do something bad on camera, don't do anything bad on camera.
[59:32.52]You'll be publicly shamed.
[59:41.88]Authorized personnel only.
[59:44.22]Oh no.
[59:48.35]I told you, you should have done your homework.
[59:51.71]There's a lot of lame, lame fucking jokes tonight, guys.
[59:56.33]Alright, I gotta move.
[59:58.47]Let's go.
[60:00.09]No batteries in this whole fucking school.
[60:03.42]How is that possible?
[60:09.10]Well, maybe they'll be in the men's room.
[60:13.65]Batteries, bandages, anything.
[60:14.95]This is a school.
[60:18.25]Like, really?
[60:21.42]There's one fucking battery here that I can't even, like, grab?
[60:24.02]Oh my god.
[60:27.04]I'm, like, so close to the TV, I'm just, like...
[60:41.28]This is like what happens when you're a little kid and you're waiting for your favorite show to come on TV.
[60:45.87]It's like, oh, Brennan Stimpy's about to come on, like, I can't wait!
[60:48.07]And he's, like, leaning in, just, like, staring at the screen.
[60:55.34]Move.
[61:04.03]It looks like the spore stream.
[61:07.53]It really does.
[61:08.59]It really is the spore stream.
[61:10.75]Oh, here we go.
[61:11.43]Here it comes.
[61:14.20]Boo!
[61:20.38]Trash can.
[61:22.64]Can't open this.
[61:26.66]Can I open this?
[61:28.28]Bathroom.
[61:30.31]Someone's gonna be in a stall.
[61:31.61]Batteries.
[61:32.57]Nope.
[61:34.34]Here we go, guy in a stall.
[61:36.64]This is something you never do, guys.
[61:38.10]You never fucking deal with, fuck with a guy's privacy.
[61:40.30]Alright, no.
[61:46.89]Here we go, here we go again.
[61:47.87]Don't fuck with a guy's privacy.
[61:49.13]Oh, well, we got a battery.
[61:52.23]That's good.
[62:01.74]Okay.
[62:03.67]I'm so old, I remember life before the Internet.
[62:07.82]It was a weird place, wasn't it?
[62:11.98]The Internet really did change so many things.
[62:14.70]Think about it.
[62:15.56]Think about, like, the stuff that you and I, like, could do before the Internet.
[62:20.46]And... Open the door.
[62:27.66]You know, it's tough, but last day of school.
[62:30.97]Senior year.
[62:32.79]I turned around and I looked back.
[62:34.29]I wanted to film it.
[62:35.99]This is the last time I was going to see South Point High School.
[62:39.93]Maybe we'd meet again someday.
[62:43.27]I opened the door to the snowy cold.
[62:45.11]I needed to do one last look.
[62:49.05]Maybe one day.
[62:49.79]I was thinking about being a teacher.
[62:54.00]That might work.
[62:56.28]Although I'd have to go to school.
[62:57.86]School's gonna be tough.
[63:00.52]It's really cold out in like a blizzard right now.
[63:06.02]I looked back one more time.
[63:07.28]And I don't know where the fuck I was walking to.
[63:12.97]Oh, I was walking into a fence.
[63:17.09]Oh well.
[63:20.45]Oh my god, there's an avalanche!
[63:27.94]Last day of school sucked.
[63:34.70]Oh, my God.
[63:41.27]You're him, ain't you?
[63:42.59]The outsider?
[63:44.41]No.
[63:44.97]They killed you, didn't they?
[63:47.31]Oh, we got a first of a first friendly NPC.
[63:50.95]Not yet.
[63:52.50]Well, they'll do it if they find you out here.
[63:55.66]Come on.
[63:57.76]Who are you?
[63:58.90]My name's Ethan.
[63:59.62]What do you mean?
[64:01.51]Oh.
[64:02.27]Oh, God.
[64:02.83]$100.
[64:03.35]What side are you on?
[64:05.17]You mean, why ain't I trying to kill you?
[64:07.25]$100 home.
[64:07.76]We gotta listen to this cutscene.
[64:08.94]Hold on.
[64:09.74]Hold on.
[64:11.08]Unborn.
[64:12.56]Seemed too much to keep the faith.
[64:14.56]But you're not one of those other ones.
[64:16.77]The heretics.
[64:18.21]Didn't say squat when my wife got scalded.
[64:21.39]Had to get cast out.
[64:23.81]Didn't complain when not.
[64:24.93]That guy's fucked up.
[64:26.12]Pressed himself on my enemy.
[64:29.18]And she gnawed my 50.
[64:31.04]I'm sorry.
[64:32.80]But when he said my grandson, maybe he puttin' her was my the antichrist and I had to slit her belly and kill the child.
[64:46.93]There were a couple of friendly NPCs in the first game that turned out they weren't friendly at all.
[64:54.85]I gave her a chance to run.
[64:56.67]Spun them in to get some stories.
[64:59.61]I've been gifted with talk my whole life.
[65:02.59]You probably noticed.
[65:03.87]Jane Doe?
[65:04.93]Zara?
[65:05.81]Your daughter?
[65:07.00]She was eight months pregnant?
[65:07.98]Got to get that extreme close-up.
[65:10.30]Yeah.
[65:12.46]What do you know?
[65:14.50]You seen her?
[65:15.52]It's why we came here.
[65:17.44]Is she all right?
[65:18.89]Arrow through the head.
[65:19.91]Missioner, just tell me she's okay.
[65:21.71]Arrow through the head right now.
[65:22.59]Three, two, one.
[65:25.91]Oh, thank God.
[65:27.49]Oh, thank God.
[65:28.57]Arrow.
[65:29.41]And God bless you.
[65:33.42]Arrow through the head right now, three.
[65:36.46]Two.
[65:37.16]He's gonna do, you want me to go down in the cellar, dude?
[65:53.24]Okay, uh... Hey, I know I just met you.
[65:56.78]This is a real fucked up town.
[65:58.93]And all kinds of fucked up shit is happening.
[66:01.11]But, you know, you look like you hit your head.
[66:03.20]Go down into my trapdoor basement.
[66:17.07]It's alright.
[66:18.37]You just relax here.
[66:19.37]I'll keep you safe.
[66:20.95]Hey, told you.
[66:25.14]I told you.
[66:25.64]Like, fucking, like, why would you trust this dude?
[66:27.86]Everyone's fucking crazy.
[66:29.90]I'm gonna turn around and there's gonna be like four bodies down here.
[66:32.92]First of all, thank you to Sneegill for the hundred bucks.
[66:38.67]They say 10,000, cheer 10,000, German Mars.
[66:42.73]Uh, thank you so much for the hundred fucking dollars.
[66:46.49]That's very kind of you.
[66:47.99]100 fucking bucks from Sneegill.
[66:54.15]Thank you so much.
[66:55.21]Should I cry every time somebody gives me $100?
[66:57.11]Should I do that?
[67:00.07]Should I just be like... I love you.
[67:04.27]Is that what I should do?
[67:06.77]No.
[67:08.01]Let's go.
[67:08.99]Let's do it.
[67:11.17]Pick a bandage.
[67:13.30]What is with all the... Oh, everyone's doing German Mars.
[67:15.39]Okay.
[67:16.27]I see.
[67:19.43]One tier, please.
[67:21.07]Of course.
[67:23.15]No, I don't want to devalue that and make it a joke.
[67:26.93]So, no.
[67:28.80]Okay.
[67:29.80]This is my sleeping quarters.
[67:30.90]Looks like... So, this is my... This is vacation vlog now, right?
[67:36.94]So, how would I do this?
[67:38.04]If I was going to do like a vacation vlog.
[67:40.27]Okay.
[67:40.77]Here we go.
[67:42.49]I'm gonna pretend like this is actually me doing this.
[67:45.13]Here comes my vlog, ready?
[67:48.03]As if like this is actually happening.
[67:50.45]Oh, it's kinda dirty in here.
[67:53.89]So we just landed.
[67:55.09]The plane landed about maybe like an hour ago or so.
[67:58.31]We just wanna get some food and just chill.
[68:01.30]Weird candle.
[68:03.38]I think it's like kinda funny that there's like a fucking weird candle.
[68:05.86]You see this weird like 17th century candle in here, honey?
[68:09.44]Yeah, that's crazy.
[68:10.86]Fucking weird, right?
[68:13.23]We landed like an hour or so ago.
[68:18.52]We're just going to get some sleep and get some food maybe a little bit later.
[68:21.82]We just made it to Disney World.
[68:23.98]This is Airbnb somewhere in Disney.

[68:29.08]Looking to get just a little bit of shut eyes.
[68:32.05]We'll catch you guys in a few minutes.
[68:33.53]When you see me next, we're going to be doing teacups at Disney.
[68:36.71]That should be lots of fun.
[68:40.81]I'm just going to get in bed here.
[68:44.37]Yeah, I'm just gonna get comfortable and relax.
[68:46.49]And this is me asleep.
[68:50.67]This is like a sleep negative $10 joke.
[68:55.71]Have you guys ever noticed that that's what everybody does?
[68:57.85]That's why vlogs are fucking stupid.
[69:01.99]They just say like, oh hey, you know, I'm gonna get some food in a minute.
[69:04.63]Just like chillin'.

[70:16.18]The front page of fucking every news organization.
[70:18.34]It's gonna be like, there's the scary person.
[70:26.39]Oh, wait a minute.
[70:26.95]I can... I think I can see through here.
[70:31.69]I could have, like, seen through this.
[70:35.45]Oh, there's... Wait, wait, wait.
[70:37.51]I got it!
[70:41.46]There's the fucking million dollar image.
[70:51.12]Let's go let's go get up.
[71:01.39]I hope you find your daughter
[71:12.85]Shit.
[71:13.29]He's dead.
[71:13.99]Oh, this guy actually was a good guy.
[71:23.80]Damn.
[71:25.28]Now I feel bad for saying all those awful things about him.
[71:31.86]Okay.
[71:32.70]Do you have anything in here I can take?
[71:33.87]What do I have?
[71:36.63]I have three bandages and one battery.
[71:43.16]Okay.
[71:47.34]I guess I do not.
[71:48.00]What?
[71:48.18]Battery right here.
[71:48.72]That's good.
[71:52.46]Uh, note that somebody else will read that later.
[71:54.50]There you go.
[71:55.22]There's like your screenshot you can take.
[71:57.30]Wait.
[72:01.61]That's so fucking stupid.
[72:06.43]That woman or whatever she is beat him to death.
[72:10.79]Something about finding Lynn.
[72:12.83]Something about a chapel.
[72:19.64]There's no picture.
[72:21.02]Just noise, but I saw it.
[72:23.24]I know I saw it.
[72:24.12]It's enormous.
[72:29.86]Some sort of hillbilly Vatican.
[72:44.49]Nice.
[72:47.31]Cool.
[72:47.67]Bye.
[72:48.99]Interesting storyline.
[72:49.91]Who cares?
[72:50.27]All we care about is the scares.
[72:51.51]That's not true.
[72:56.74]I care about the story too.
[72:59.54]Just not really at all.
[73:05.36]Now let's go.
[73:21.92]Machines don't lie.
[73:25.02]Um... I kinda have no idea where the fuck I'm going.
[73:43.51]Oh no, it's grandma.
[73:47.08]Grandma's gonna take like a skinny dip.
[73:59.36]Is she feeding the birds?
[74:00.80]What are you doing?
[74:01.32]Whatever.
[74:02.82]I gotta go up that way, so let's swim across.
[74:23.69]Cast a spell?
[74:26.33]What spells do I have at my disposal?
[74:32.54]I wish I could just cast, like, a fireball.
[74:34.06]That'd be so fucking awesome.
[74:34.98]Alright, let's keep going.
[74:39.00]I'm running faster than I was before.
[74:40.92]I'm, like, sprinting so fast.
[74:47.92]Got it.
[74:48.90]Fucking Christ!
[74:53.01]What?
[74:56.37]Oh.
[74:57.91]Right.
[75:03.87]I want to go, like, watch that.
[75:05.23]Hold on.
[75:06.54]Let's see what he says.
[75:07.84]And right here, I fucking freaked out.
[75:17.86]Good timing.
[75:19.56]Showed the anger in my voice.
[75:20.70]Okay, let's go.
[75:33.77]The guy here.
[75:41.79]That's so scary.
[75:44.11]I'm smiling!
[75:45.20]That's all that's happening is I'm smiling.
[75:56.82]There's people behind me right now.
[75:58.12]Hurry up and get this filmed.
[75:58.96]Come on.
[75:59.32]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[76:02.67]Come on.
[76:03.11]There's people right behind me with flashlights.
[76:04.59]Get it filmed.
[76:05.17]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[76:06.23]Got it.
[76:06.69]Okay.
[76:08.71]What do I do about this guy?
[76:10.03]What do I do with this guy?
[76:12.21]Is there like a, there's got to be like a hidden little path here, right?
[76:14.15]There's like a path or something, right?
[76:16.91]How do I sneak through?
[76:17.49]How do I open this?
[76:20.17]Gone.
[76:22.22]Oh, shit.
[76:26.22]Get on this prone on the ground and they won't see me.
[76:31.22]This is not good.
[76:34.38]There was probably like a little... I got our film.
[76:36.87]That's all that matters.
[76:37.89]The flashlights are... This is Metal Gear Solid 3.
[76:40.77]They can't see you unless you're in the flashlight.
[76:43.01]See?
[76:44.69]All these guys... These guys don't have eyes.
[76:46.03]They have flashlights.
[76:46.87]So this little beam is where their eyes can see.
[76:50.36]Let's get away from the turnaround.
[76:54.22]Good.
[76:54.74]Okay.
[77:03.25]Now, where is the way to get through here?
[77:05.93]Because I can't see anything right there.
[77:08.81]I don't think so.
[77:09.59]Nothing on the left or the right.
[77:10.77]Okay.
[77:12.05]I can't do anything about this?
[77:13.17]I can't, like, smash this?
[77:17.65]Whatever.
[77:17.97]There we go.
[77:19.81]Right here.
[77:21.13]I knew there had to be something, right?
[77:22.55]Okay.
[77:32.10]Audio, audio, audio!
[77:34.30]Put on the audio!
[77:34.90]Where is he?
[77:35.20]I'm not, I'm not... This is gonna fuck up my audio.
[77:42.75]God damn it, this guy in the background, I can't edit him out.
[77:44.87]This is gonna fuck up my footage.
[77:48.79]God.
[77:54.37]Battery's down there.
[77:59.34]Can't carry any more bandages.
[78:00.38]Well, I'm just gonna heal then.
[78:03.29]What?
[78:05.37]Oh no, they all came out.
[78:17.72]They all came out.
[78:18.40]They all came out of the fucking corn.
[78:19.84]The children of the fucking corn.
[78:21.20]Go for the jump!
[78:52.78]That was some fast moving for my part.
[78:56.83]That was some fast fucking moving.
[78:59.47]Thought I was gonna get caught right there.
[79:01.69]Nope.
[79:07.17]Jerma985, in quotes, the speedster.
[79:10.03]Doesn't get fucking caught.
[79:11.05]He goes right where he needs to go.
[79:13.19]Without any issues at all.
[79:22.09]Can't get in here.
[79:23.81]I guess I can't get in this house.
[79:26.29]Okay.
[79:31.22]Batteries?
[79:31.70]No, I can hide in the sludge.
[79:32.86]I don't want to hide in the sludge right now.
[79:36.95]Right here.
[79:37.29]None of these fucking doors open.
[79:41.07]None of these windows open.
[79:42.08]What the hell, man?
[79:52.38]Oh, shit.
[79:53.36]Can I get... I wish I could bash my camera into this guy's head.
[79:58.04]I definitely can't do that, though.
[80:05.90]I think I can jump on the roof.
[80:09.30]Can I open... No, I can't open this window.
[80:11.55]I can definitely get up here.
[80:15.83]Like, I would assume I can get up here, right?
[80:22.89]You can't make it up there.
[80:24.79]How is that possible?
[80:26.67]You can't jump up there.
[80:27.45]Yeah, I know.
[80:27.73]But, like... You know what?
[80:28.67]Fuck it.
[80:40.66]I don't think this guy- no, this guy doesn't get up.
[80:44.20]Okay.
[80:49.45]What is he holding?
[80:50.05]I just got electrocuted in my seat!
[81:00.70]What the fuck?
[81:01.32]My seat was just electrocuted!
[81:02.96]What the fuck was that?
[81:05.60]Ugh!
[81:07.21]Somebody must have, like, pranked me and put an electrocution device in my seat!
[81:11.89]What the hell was that?
[81:16.37]Oh, my whole body hurts right now.
[81:18.29]Fucking jeez.
[81:26.09]What's happening?
[81:29.33]Uh... I can't press W, A, S, or D. What did I do?
[81:45.64]Uh, W, W, I can't press W, A, S, D. Pressing W unlocks my mic.
[81:54.99]Somebody short-circuited my computer, I told you!
[81:58.37]The fucking electricity, like, went through the computer!
[82:00.72]Uh, I might have to... I have to, like, reload the game.
[82:10.48]Hold on, give me a second.
[82:14.76]Let me reload Outlast.
[82:20.36]Make sure that's not gonna happen again.
[82:21.40]Okay, hold on.
[82:24.81]Okay.
[82:28.19]I don't know what I did, but when I press W, like, Windows 10 opens up a new menu.
[82:33.45]I don't even- I don't know what I've done.
[82:35.05]I don't.
[82:37.18]Uh, hold on.
[82:37.70]Give me a second.
[82:38.92]I'll be right back.
[82:40.84]I need to figure out what I just did.
[82:42.16]I just got fucking electrocuted.
[82:44.88]Give me a second.
[84:48.37]Yeah.
[86:31.08]Okay, hi.
[86:33.14]Let's get back.
[86:34.62]Let's get back to it.
[86:38.50]Uh-huh.
[86:39.30]Okay.
[86:40.92]Hopefully that works.
[86:43.84]I fucking royally fucked it up.
[86:45.57]Okay, where's my... Oh, no.
[86:53.75]Oh, God.
[86:54.53]Honest to God, I don't know.
[86:57.13]When I, like, press any buttons...
[87:00.07]Like, what, F1?
[87:01.11]Like, I don't even know what's going on.
[87:03.55]What could I have possibly pressed?
[87:08.09]Like, what in Windows 10 makes, like, pressing W open up Windows Ink Workspace?
[87:12.28]Does anybody know what the fuck I did?
[87:16.00]Like, if I press D, it, it, like, minimizes everything.
[87:20.39]A opens up Action Center.
[87:22.89]Like, what did I do?
[87:24.21]How do I fucking turn this off?
[87:30.18]What is it?
[87:32.42]Like, when I press W, it opens up Windows Ink Workspace.
[87:39.56]I can't even use the computer right now.
[87:44.88]The Windows key.
[87:47.14]Control or Alt?
[87:50.31]No.
[87:51.35]Windows.
[87:52.35]No.
[87:54.87]F. What is it?
[87:57.77]No, I don't have the win- the Windows key's not pressed.
[88:00.29]There's like a... Something really weird is going on.
[88:04.74]Backspace?
[88:08.52]Oh, okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was back- was ba- Fuck you, Windows 10.
[88:14.66]Like, what the fuck?
[88:15.20]You press Backspace and it makes all your keys?
[88:18.71]Wait a minute.
[88:19.25]That wasn't it.
[88:21.11]What happened?
[88:23.91]Okay, so, um... We're good.
[88:26.65]We're ready to go.
[88:30.53]I don't know.
[88:30.93]I don't, I, I've no idea like why that exists, but here we go.
[88:37.73]Uh, Outlast 2.
[88:38.69]Let's get back to it, huh?
[88:39.55]Let me move.

[88:45.56]There we go.
[88:47.92]Loud.
[88:49.42]Sorry about that.
[88:51.28]Sorry.
[88:51.58]It's going to be fucking loud.
[88:54.10]Loud game.
[88:55.48]Very loud game.
[88:59.86]That's better.
[89:03.17]Okay.
[89:06.21]Yeah, like, I got electrocuted so bad that it, like, fucked up my computer.
[89:09.31]Like, I seriously, like, honest to God, like, I'm gonna find out who fucking did that.
[89:11.96]And, like, you're in big trouble, man.
[89:15.18]You're in deep shit when I find out who fucking, like, put, like, a device, like, rigged up to, like, an electrocution thing that, like, zapped me.
[89:21.42]Trying to, like, stream a game.
[89:23.73]You know what I mean?
[89:24.31]Like, fuck you.
[89:25.09]I'm trying to stream a game.

[90:40.22]We got a save point right here, and we're gonna hide right here.
[90:45.00]Literally underneath the table.
[90:49.19]Gotta go deeper.
[90:51.01]We're gonna go deeper, just like a little... Just like a dog that, like, is scared of, like... Just like a scared dog from Thunder.
[90:56.61]Like a dog on the lambs.

[92:13.75]Oh, sneeze.
[92:14.51]That's what that was.
[92:15.23]Just got a little tickle in the nose.
[92:16.91]Not a big deal.
[92:33.26]Ah!
[92:42.61]I look like a Simpsons character when I do this.
[92:52.86]What Simpsons character is that?
[92:56.04]Fucking ugly one.
[93:01.66]You know, I did the skip right there was where I needed to go, so let's go this way.
[93:07.54]Battery?
[93:11.36]Homer?
[93:18.57]That's a Dark Souls enemy if I've ever seen one.
[93:21.49]Everybody, don't you guys know?
[93:22.43]Everything is Dark Souls.
[93:24.33]Everything is Dark Souls.
[93:25.43]No matter what it is.
[93:28.99]Do I need to film this?
[93:31.93]Nah.
[93:35.37]Nah, let's sing this.
[93:36.81]I'll sing this for you.
[93:42.20]Never mind.
[93:43.24]I ain't doing that.
[93:46.80]Let's sing this.
[93:47.56]What a fu- Oh yeah, what an entertainer.
[93:49.31]I'm gonna sing this.
[93:53.23]Entertainment, huh?
[93:59.46]I have to have this on even though I don't want to.
[94:03.24]Car headlights?
[94:10.08]Who keeps blowing this giant fucking horn, man?
[94:13.66]That's getting annoying.
[94:16.10]Is that irritating anybody else with me?
[94:18.53]Well, I mean, I can go down here.
[94:20.05]Let me see if it's down here first.
[94:28.93]Well, it's a good thing I came down here, because it's bad right here.
[94:33.79]And a dead guy.
[94:37.97]A headless dead guy.
[94:46.16]I've reached the next dream lair.
[94:48.00]Alright, here we go.
[94:54.83]First boss.
[94:57.45]Here comes the first boss.
[95:11.58]Okay.
[95:14.42]I guess I failed at the first boss.
[95:20.63]The first boss was the hole.
[95:21.97]The giant hole.
[95:22.81]Cool.
[95:24.33]I still remember that I picked up the fucking battery.
[95:26.31]That's all I care about.
[95:27.12]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[95:35.08]Doobie.
[95:38.00]First boss is gravity.
[95:44.02]Why was... I was just filming something.
[95:45.50]What am I filming here?
[95:47.60]What the fuck was that?
[95:52.60]What does it want me to... I'm not going to move.
[95:54.16]I don't know what it wants me to film.
[95:58.24]What does it want me to film here?
[96:00.54]The fence.
[96:02.23]That's a pretty good fence.
[96:03.89]Yeah, save that one.
[96:04.77]I want to know what the fuck that was for.
[96:11.19]That was every art film you'll ever watch in your life.
[96:23.50]Take away all the context, get rid of all the scary monsters, all like the weird cult religious type shit.
[96:29.32]You just watched every art film you will ever see.
[96:40.02]This time I'm gonna fall down.
[96:41.32]Okay, so then... Alright.
[96:43.00]Flashlight.
[96:43.56]No.
[96:47.22]Uh, no.
[96:48.35]Can't go this way.
[96:49.55]Sure.
[96:51.03]I have to go this way.
[96:55.45]Uh, can I jump up here?
[96:56.35]I don't think so.
[96:59.58]I'm stuck in the fucking tree now.
[97:04.78]No, really game, don't put me in here.
[97:06.38]Um... Up here?
[97:17.02]Yeah, there we go.
[97:27.57]Why would it want me to go up here if I can't?
[97:29.19]Oh, here's a ledge.
[97:32.03]Oh, bird's on the table.
[97:33.15]I'm talking about a live stream here, guys.
[97:42.06]Bird.
[97:44.22]Got it.
[97:47.70]I was about to be so angry about that.
[97:49.19]That would have really, really made me angry.
[97:54.09]If I didn't make that jump, I would have been fucking livid.
[98:03.77]It's going like the spooky cave.
[98:06.31]Here we go.
[98:11.07]That almost made me throw up.
[98:14.58]There's another little spooky entrance.
[98:20.00]Keep going.
[98:21.56]Keep going.
[98:23.36]Just like in Super Mario 64.
[98:26.16]Holy shit.
[98:29.56]That's elaborate.
[98:32.77]Let's see what he has to say about it.
[98:36.59]He said she did it to herself.
[98:39.09]He said he was protecting you.
[98:40.39]I love that final last second, like, super zoom.
[98:50.66]Church.
[98:51.68]This really does remind me of Resident Evil.
[98:53.78]Some kind of... Resident Evil 4.
[98:57.28]I'm getting lots of Resident Evil 4 vibes.
[98:58.74]I wish I had, like, a handgun.
[99:00.56]Ah.
[99:06.64]I already, like, filmed all this shit, right?
[99:08.82]Okay.
[99:11.50]Uh, we're jumping to here.
[99:12.76]Don't, don't scare me like that every time.
[99:19.56]Go to the altar?
[99:20.22]What do you mean, the altar?
[99:21.02]I ain't doing that.
[99:24.56]I ain't gonna get fucking Satan-faced.
[99:30.42]Batteries, batteries, no.
[99:36.34]Somebody's t-shirt.
[99:37.96]That's not a t-shirt.
[99:39.12]That is a decayed person.
[99:40.90]Okay.
[99:41.74]Thought it was a t-shirt.
[99:44.31]Thought it was a standard straight up red tee.
[99:48.15]I'm going too fast.
[99:48.75]Slow down.
[99:51.37]Oh, not a red t-shirt.
[99:57.37]God.
[100:03.27]Lynn!
[100:04.65]Lynn!
[100:07.98]Oh, God.
[100:08.54]Save.
[100:08.84]Get her.
[100:09.08]Go get her.
[100:10.18]Save her.
[100:11.60]She ain't even there.
[100:12.14]I'm losing my mind.
[100:13.98]My character's going insane.
[100:17.54]Batteries?
[100:20.28]Nothing?
[100:20.80]No?
[100:22.20]Okay.
[100:22.66]Go.
[100:23.96]Oh, I can't go.
[100:24.68]Yes, I can.
[100:29.40]Pranked.
[100:40.08]Let's see what he says here.
[100:42.51]I don't know what's happening and I don't understand.
[100:45.55]Travel.
[100:46.61]I can see the chapel.
[100:48.77]Before I just go feeling my teeth.
[100:52.01]In the sound of scissors.
[100:56.33]It's really just a fucking art film.
[100:57.85]I can't go down there.
[100:58.94]I need to like be careful here.
[101:00.22]Yeah, and I can't see either.
[101:02.84]Need some batteries, batteries, batteries.
[101:07.24]That's correct.
[101:09.38]Don't let them get me.
[101:10.32]I'll make sure they won't get you.
[101:13.66]I'm here for you guys.
[101:15.48]I'm the proxy.
[101:16.72]So if any monsters come out to come to get you, you know what I mean?
[101:20.86]I've seen somebody fucking get ready.
[101:23.14]You know what I'm saying?
[101:23.76]You ever seen fast movement like that in fucking Taekwondo?
[101:26.45]I took Taekwondo.
[101:27.71]Number one thing I learned.
[101:30.21]You know what I'm saying?
[101:30.95]Fucking they're gonna get you.
[101:32.19]They're gonna go through me.
[101:35.15]You ever seen fucking movement like that in your life?
[101:40.25]Let's go here.
[101:41.19]Flashlight?
[101:42.13]Battery?
[101:54.98]Don't say battery three times, you'll summon battery juice.
[101:58.44]Speaking of battery juice, I did that too early.
[102:00.16]I did that too early, but it's okay.
[102:17.69]Well, I'm convinced.
[102:23.21]Hello?
[102:34.82]Use the audio device.
[102:45.45]Okay.
[102:47.77]More reading.
[102:51.27]More children.
[102:54.09]This is a dastardly fucking village, man.
[103:03.31]Unlock and open.
[103:04.32]Sure.
[103:08.34]Now we're going up the stairs into the scary fucking house.
[103:10.78]Everybody knows what's going to happen.
[103:12.02]Is he dead?
[103:15.58]Doesn't look dead.
[103:16.70]He's going to get up.
[103:18.99]Watch this.
[103:19.67]He's gonna get up.
[103:20.45]Goddamn Illuminati, you know what I mean?
[103:28.74]It's just fucking Illuminati, like, taking over.
[103:32.86]It's fucked up.
[103:47.96]He wants me to block this door for some reason.
[103:53.76]Should I do that preemptively?
[103:59.27]Oh.
[104:01.67]Apparently not.
[104:04.55]This guy's going to stand up.
[104:08.63]He's going to come up the stairs.
[104:10.35]I'm just going to get ready for it.
[104:16.59]my batteries and shit man I'm like not paying that much attention to that I need to really start to pay attention document store it papa ezekiel liar charlatan temple took out addict coward rapist child killer those are not synonyms this is not at the thor this is not a thesaurus that's that's fucked up so we're gonna put it up
[104:47.72]Okay.
[104:51.80]Like, it was just words for a second, and then I got really fucked up.
[104:58.14]Can I open the fucking door, man?
[105:05.88]There's a guy right there.
[105:06.88]Where are you going?
[105:08.33]That guy's, like, sprinting.
[105:13.31]Batteries, nothing?
[105:14.41]Come on.
[105:16.19]You're not doing me a solid here, game.
[105:22.87]Nothing over here?
[105:23.85]Really?
[105:24.23]There's no way there's nothing over there.
[105:26.15]Come on.
[105:28.20]Like, what?
[105:29.88]Wait.
[105:32.28]It's a pull, not push.
[105:33.24]It wasn't clearly fucking labeled on the door.
[105:36.58]Don't give me shit when it's not clearly labeled.
[105:38.56]When I go to a store...
[105:40.56]And, you know, sometimes that happens.
[105:42.08]You push a door and it's like, and you fucking run into it and shit.
[105:44.62]But it's like, if it's not clearly labeled, clearly fucking label your doors.
[105:49.88]Idiots.
[105:56.59]See, that said pull.
[106:00.53]That said pull.
[106:02.70]I know what to do there.
[106:03.46]Alright, I need to activate the generator.
[106:10.27]Wherever the fuck that is.
[106:12.55]God, it's gonna be like down here and it's gonna be all over the place.
[106:15.12]It's gonna be a nightmare.
[106:19.22]Oh, okay.
[106:19.98]I have to go down here to activate the generator and get chased by the scary lady with the scythe.
[106:25.84]Can't wait.
[106:33.11]Shit.
[106:40.59]This guy's just staring into the camera.
[107:15.76]You know, just keep talking.
[107:17.04]That's okay.
[107:18.24]Just keep talking.
[107:19.83]I'm going to go in here.
[107:26.25]I'm just practicing my singing voice.
[107:27.83]Is it good?
[107:34.42]I just want to see how high I can go.
[107:36.66]That might be an elevator.
[107:39.75]And also, let me try to get myself to practice.
[107:44.49]Pretty good.
[107:49.16]I'm auditioning for a play tomorrow, so...
[107:59.61]Sometimes I'm weird like that.
[108:01.09]Sometimes I just snap into, like, my music career.
[108:03.98]You guys know I have a very successful music, uh, officiant career.
[108:08.40]I need to, like, be practicing at all times.
[108:12.18]Hey, don't open that door.
[108:13.04]I got it.
[108:13.62]What about the dudes playing cards over there?
[108:17.34]I need to wait for her to come by.
[108:18.68]...the children of hell, but also...
[108:28.01]Just keep fucking go.
[108:30.39]Come on, lady.
[108:31.53]Okay.
[108:36.42]Go fuck yourself.
[108:37.02]Anybody in here?
[108:44.64]Better not be.
[108:47.79]Close the fucking door.
[108:56.20]No batteries in here.
[108:57.36]Come on.
[109:09.91]No batteries.
[109:11.69]Still.
[109:13.91]What kind of game is this?
[109:16.01]Fucking FromSoftware.
[109:20.51]Do a better job next time, FromSoftware.
[109:24.52]Fucking clean your nails.
[109:26.95]Nothing.
[109:31.27]Okay, all I did was just block myself in.
[109:35.89]I was going to be... I really figured there was going to be like a battery underneath here.
[109:41.55]Apparently not.
[109:44.31]No battery under the dresser, guys.
[109:53.00]I call top bunk.
[110:02.36]Label your fucking doors.
[110:13.17]None of you people have iPhones?
[110:16.03]How can you own fucking- How can you own a house and own an iPhone but not, like, a bunch of AA batteries?
[110:20.07]I don't understand.
[110:25.87]Like, we all have fucking iPhones and yet nobody- You got a guitar, but you don't have batteries.
[110:32.42]Un-fucking-believable.
[110:36.18]You have a guitar, but you don't have batteries for the guitar?
[110:39.78]And I didn't want to do that.
[110:41.12]I did not want to do this, but I'm doing it, apparently.
[110:51.67]I just, like, landed on top of her.
[110:56.27]Oh, god damn it!
[110:57.83]God damn it.
[110:59.31]God damn it!
[111:01.67]Oh my god, I just like landed on top of the girl.
[111:05.11]I gotta hide.
[111:05.75]Open!
[111:06.81]Label your doors!
[111:12.27]Ah!
[111:12.47]Grandma's in here!
[111:14.00]Ah!
[111:14.24]Grandma's in here!
[111:15.10]Label your fucking doors!
[111:18.26]Wait, what?
[111:33.15]I don't even fucking care.
[111:49.18]Oh, yeah, scary.
[111:50.42]Oh, look out for the lady.
[111:52.84]Fuck off.
[111:55.33]Who cares?
[111:55.97]Just get to the fucking generator.
[111:57.59]I'm gonna go by all the scripted fucking cutscenes and just go to the generator.
[112:02.41]Wherever that is.
[112:02.99]Okay, I gotta Oscar the Grouch.
[112:15.02]I gotta Oscar the Grouch this shit right now.
[112:22.45]I'm gonna have to Oscar the Grouch.
[112:23.65]That's great.
[112:42.51]Okay, is he gone?
[112:50.57]I think it's up there, I think.
[112:58.81]Fine, whatever.
[113:05.42]Generator.
[113:08.04]Generator, generator.
[113:09.40]Come on, this is like a garage.
[113:10.98]It has to be like in here somewhere, right?
[113:13.06]Generator.
[113:13.55]This is the grandma room, okay.
[113:25.19]It's not in here.
[113:27.34]Don't walk towards grandma.
[113:29.74]Walk up the stairs.
[113:32.82]Are you some kind of dumb idiot?
[113:35.98]Don't be an idiot.
[113:42.54]Generator.
[113:43.28]Power generator room.
[113:44.70]Got it!
[113:45.24]Now where's the generator?
[113:48.99]Where's generator Rex?
[113:51.85]On Disney XD.
[113:55.29]Papa.
[114:02.46]And yet there's no batteries anywhere.
[114:05.14]I feel like there's way less batteries in this game than any of the other ones.
[114:08.44]Label your fucking doors.
[114:15.12]Don't start this yet.
[114:17.20]I'm going to start this and it's going to... Here's a ready.
[114:18.62]Here you go.
[114:18.98]Ready?
[114:19.78]I'm going to pull the button and it's going to go... Here we go.
[114:22.92]There you go.
[114:47.24]I'm doing exercises.
[114:48.06]All right, I did my exercise for the day.
[114:56.42]Just a few exercises.
[114:57.60]There it is.
[115:00.15]Okay, I did my cardio.
[115:06.11]Move.
[115:06.35]You bitch.
[115:06.81]Move.
[115:08.17]You bitch.
[115:08.45]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[115:09.07]Open your fucking doors.
[115:58.08]Shit in my mouth.
[115:58.86]Shit in my mouth.
[115:59.60]I'm not scared.
[116:00.36]I just like to shit in my mouth.
[116:15.65]He took off my penis.
[116:24.85]Don't make me do the fucking whole thing again.
[116:26.27]Thank God.
[116:32.24]I'm just gonna run.
[116:32.88]You know, this is all scripted events.
[116:37.20]All these things are scripted.
[116:38.56]What if you just run fucking by the person that's scary?
[116:41.99]You're not gonna have time to be scared.
[116:43.75]The game ran out of time.
[116:46.70]Sorry, game.
[116:47.40]You ran out of time.
[116:49.00]Sorry, video game.
[116:50.50]You ran out of time.
[116:52.74]You thought you were gonna scare me.
[116:54.59]You ran out of time.
[116:55.97]Your scripted event ran out of time, honey.
[116:58.59]Sorry.
[116:59.59]Sorry, your event ran out of time.
[117:13.41]That would have worked if I didn't get fucking hit.
[117:22.15]I'm gonna do that again.
[117:22.75]This time I'm not gonna run around her.
[117:24.65]I just need to go right.
[117:34.46]What about down here?
[117:35.94]Safe?
[117:36.58]Safe.
[117:49.91]Get up!
[117:53.77]Here's what we're gonna do.
[117:55.13]Oscar the Grouch.
[117:58.29]Where did she go?
[117:58.79]There she is, okay.
[117:59.53]Here we go.
[118:04.08]Oscar the fucking Grouch, guys.
[118:05.88]Ladies and gentlemen, get in the trash can.
[118:09.64]Sesame Street.
[118:20.85]Oscar.
[118:23.99]Why would you come over here and look in the trash can?
[118:28.13]Excuse me!
[118:33.27]That was gonna be a joke.
[118:36.53]Get out of here, kids.
[118:40.92]She actually came right over to the trash can.
[118:44.64]Here we go.
[118:46.60]We gotta go around her and to the right.
[118:51.69]Where is she?
[118:52.05]I don't know, go!
[119:09.06]Ahh!
[119:17.06]My throat was a little blocked.
[119:31.01]We're clear now.
[119:35.53]What else?
[119:35.85]Is that grandma?
[119:40.43]Why is grandma dead?
[119:47.82]R2-D2.
[119:49.50]R2-D2.
[119:49.64]Yeah, I was doing my R2-D2 impression.
[119:56.74]Okay.
[120:00.38]Rip off the planks?
[120:06.44]Look at the way I'm, like, fucking leaning in here.
[120:07.92]This is ridiculous.
[120:08.99]Okay.
[120:11.43]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[120:12.27]Go, go, go.
[120:22.57]Jessica.
[120:40.10]Got you, motherfuckers!
[120:41.76]I got you!
[120:48.38]You got fucking scared!
[121:18.04]Then I just got grabbed by a monster.
[121:21.14]Scary!
[121:21.74]Stop!
[121:25.20]What's going on?
[121:37.58]He's just stretching my back.
[121:42.04]My back needs to be stretched.
[121:49.60]Oh, fuck.
[121:51.22]I was trying to break into the school, and I got all fucked up in the vents.
[121:56.54]No, man, I was just trying to go get my report card so I could change the grades on it so my mom wouldn't be fucking mad at me.
[122:03.51]I wanted to get myself a C instead of a D, because C is at least reputable enough where you're not going to get in trouble by your parents.
[122:10.19]Or maybe you will, but you won't get in too much trouble.
[122:14.45]Label your fucking doors.
[122:27.45]Reload.
[122:32.97]Oh, monsters.
[122:34.82]Monsters in my school.
[122:36.68]What a fucking great R.L.
[122:38.20]Stine book this would be.
[122:39.66]Hey, there's a jacket in there.
[122:43.32]What's that?
[122:45.64]Maybe the music box, whatever the hell this is.
[122:49.91]Why would I do this?
[122:52.39]The Jack in the Box is going to come out and scare everybody.
[122:56.11]It's going to be a scary clown.
[122:57.39]It's going to be like... I've used these before.
[123:01.03]You're not going to jump scare me with a fucking clown machine.
[123:08.67]That didn't even... Nothing even happened.
[123:14.27]What?
[123:19.05]Fucking Vincent Price in the background, like, laughing.
[123:23.85]Darkness falls across land.
[123:26.95]Creatures crawl in search of blood to terrify your neighborhood.
[123:31.85]And though you fight to stay alive, your body starts to quiver because you cannot define the magic of the thriller.
[123:45.91]Here he comes.
[123:51.10]You didn't think I knew that whole thing, did you?
[123:55.96]They're all jammed.
[123:56.56]I don't understand.
[124:01.81]I'm glad that did fucking nothing.
[124:07.31]Yep, those are the lyrics.
[124:13.88]Haha.
[124:17.14]There's a fucking haha in my chest!
[124:21.62]What am I supposed to do?
[124:22.42]I'm just, like, moving the projector around.
[124:23.98]Uh, okay.
[124:41.52]Oh, hey, there's a person!
[124:42.82]Just... Ah!
[124:48.75]Don't worry, I'll climb to the window.
[124:50.49]Why is it always so dark?
[124:59.28]You guys.
[124:59.98]Alright, fine.
[125:01.58]Fuck you guys.
[125:02.32]You think you're so funny?
[125:04.53]You like this scary red setup I had here?
[125:07.19]Now we're going to go with fucking every movie you've ever seen?
[125:10.49]That was filmed on a digital camera?
[125:11.83]No, I look like shit right now.
[125:13.43]We're going back to what we were.
[125:15.93]At least this time I can hide in the light.
[125:18.07]I won't look like such a fucking murderer.
[125:24.47]I've just been wasting battery this whole time, by the way.
[125:26.65]Fucking idiot.
[125:27.13]What is this?
[125:27.51]I don't know.
[125:35.45]It's really quiet, though.
[125:36.99]I don't like that.
[125:44.81]Failed it.
[125:48.94]Got it.
[125:51.62]That's why I videotaped this person hanging themselves.
[125:53.76]I'm fucking really fucked up.
[125:56.92]Okay.
[126:07.11]Can I move the TV?
[126:13.09]Oh god!
[126:14.34]Yes!
[126:18.95]What are these monsters?
[126:20.07]Like, all right.
[126:21.28]All right.
[126:21.88]All right.
[126:22.30]Hold on.
[126:24.92]Outlast 1 was like, you're in a mental asylum hospital and there's all these scary, creepy people and shit.
[126:30.75]And there's a lot of scary stuff and a lot of weird experiments.
[126:34.73]Don't put monsters in these games.
[126:36.19]Like, what the... You had me with the whole, like, religious cult thing.
[126:40.33]And now there's, like, fucking gigantic monsters that wrap tentacles around you and eat you.
[126:46.40]Like, I mean, come on.
[126:48.12]What is this?
[126:48.64]This is like a Resident Evil game now.
[126:50.28]Outlast 2, 4 out of 10.
[127:15.26]Label your doors!
[127:38.95]Jump over to a fucking random radiator.
[127:41.11]Jump over it.
[127:46.79]Everybody.
[127:56.60]Everybody.
[127:58.98]Go!
[128:00.10]Go, you fucking idiot!
[128:01.80]He's not behind me, is he?
[128:02.70]He's just crawling behind me.
[128:04.36]Hey, we're all gonna go in here.
[128:05.64]Oh god, we're all in here.
[128:08.89]Come on.
[128:09.83]They can't be all coming here with me.
[128:11.45]What the fuck?
[128:12.99]Why do they go in here?
[128:15.23]What?
[128:16.01]He's not gonna be still here.
[128:17.09]Which way do I go?
[128:17.67]Left or right?
[128:18.27]Right.
[128:21.75]And I have to heal, too.
[128:22.71]Is he still right behind me?
[128:24.59]Of course he is.
[128:25.57]Go!
[128:26.85]It would be nice if you could go, please.
[128:29.53]Go!
[128:30.07]Hello!
[128:32.57]I would love it if you would get the fuck up now and run and heal.
[128:43.79]I don't even, I don't know where the fuck I'm supposed to be going.
[128:46.14]That's the problem.
[128:46.90]Where was I supposed to go?
[128:48.14]Where was the actual end goal?
[128:49.46]I don't know.
[128:51.32]Battery.
[128:55.29]Fucking fuck me.
[128:56.53]Alright, we're gonna do some football moves here.
[129:01.77]Like a quarterback, NFL fucking running back.
[129:03.81]9-8.
[129:03.85]9-8-5.
[129:16.27]Like, where the fuck was I supposed to even go?
[129:21.83]Where are you supposed to even go?
[129:22.89]Like, where the fuck are you supposed to go?
[129:26.98]Damn freak.
[129:29.52]Like, where are you supposed to go?
[129:37.86]Like, cool.
[129:40.90]Go, go, go.
[129:41.78]Yeah, and then I go in the fucking cellar.
[129:45.48]Go in the cellar.
[129:46.84]Drop down.
[129:47.70]Gohan.
[129:48.56]Ah, Gohan.
[129:51.60]Now, like, where do I go?
[130:02.38]Just chill with them.
[130:03.04]They seem cool.
[130:06.76]It's like, okay, so now I'm back at, like, the well.
[130:08.58]But where the fuck was the end goal?
[130:10.38]I don't even know what the end goal was supposed to be.
[130:16.38]Does anybody know what the fucking end goal was here?
[130:18.14]Like, I don't know.
[130:22.60]Like, back in the well?
[130:23.54]No.
[130:27.97]I honestly just don't know what the end goal was.
[130:30.37]Like, this way?
[130:31.25]Consume the flesh.
[130:36.99]Spast the whale.
[130:38.57]Let the bones be burned.
[130:42.48]I mean, this door is open.
[130:44.54]I guess I'll go in here.
[130:46.15]Ahhh!
[130:48.47]What are you doing?
[130:51.23]I guess I'm supposed to go this way.
[130:52.39]Batteries.
[131:11.43]This is like shit.
[131:12.29]There's like somebody coming in this door right now.
[131:13.99]I gotta hide under a fucking goddamn, like, little boy's bed.
[131:17.05]I gotta get under a fucking bunk bed right now.
[131:26.95]There's no way a grown man fits under this bed, by the way.
[131:29.67]Like, not a chance.
[131:31.33]Okay, go.
[131:37.67]Close the fucking door.
[131:38.37]There is no door.
[131:39.39]There's no door!
[131:42.04]Of course there's no door.
[131:43.42]Why would there be a door?
[131:45.21]To close behind me.
[131:46.15]To make sure I didn't die.
[131:48.47]And there's nothing else in here too.
[131:49.63]Open this.
[131:50.97]Do you think you can open this door?
[132:01.22]Shit.
[132:18.20]Is he gone?
[133:08.39]I don't have any batteries.
[133:09.05]I don't have any fucking batteries left.
[133:14.38]Fantastic.
[133:15.66]And I don't see any.
[133:23.77]I hear people.
[133:25.13]Get in the closet, now!
[133:42.15]Somebody right there.
[133:54.55]There's a guy upstairs.
[133:55.63]All right, here we go.
[133:56.09]Ready?
[133:57.83]Go.
[134:20.19]That guy wasn't making any fucking noise!
[134:43.19]Where the fuck do I go right now?
[135:01.14]It's just right there.
[135:12.41]God damn it.
[135:13.19]Like, how am I supposed to even know where the fuck this guy is right now?
[135:18.57]I did this last time and he wasn't even in this room.
[135:20.85]Just go.
[135:21.37]We gotta go.
[135:21.81]Okay, he's over there.
[135:30.60]I really, really get- I'm getting annoyed by the whole fucking backwards-forwards door shit, by the way.
[135:35.25]Alright, where do I go from here?
[135:40.31]Straight through here?
[135:42.94]And then through here.
[135:43.74]I gotta move this.
[135:46.00]YOU FUCKING IDIOT!
[136:00.64]This guy wasn't even fucking down here!
[136:02.14]Oh my god.
[136:03.58]Like, wha- I- I just- just- I- I- This game is not good, by the way.
[136:20.11]I don't know where the hell they fucking lost their charm from the first one to the second one.
[136:25.70]This is not even close to being as good as the first one was.
[136:28.78]There's the outside!
[136:31.11]These are my judgments on you.
[136:33.35]Scum.
[136:33.65]You'll be fired.
[136:34.73]He's just chasing me like I don't even fucking care.
[136:37.43]I like, I like lost this guy apparently.
[136:39.79]Pass, please.
[137:17.91]Resident Evil 7.
[137:18.57]I don't know, I just feel like there's no, it's like...
[137:27.37]I don't know, like, the danger in this one seems to just be, like, irritating, not, like, scary.
[137:43.08]There's a guy just, like, he's just right here.
[137:45.92]Will you just please go away for a minute, please?
[137:52.80]He's still just in here?
[137:53.72]You can't just still be in the room, are you?
[137:58.00]If he's in this room still, like, I mean, come on.
[137:59.83]Like, leave, man.
[138:07.45]I'm going for it.
[138:19.64]Like, what are you, what the, what, what the, what the fuck?
[138:21.92]Move it.
[138:24.14]Can I not, like, squeeze through this?
[138:25.58]Wait, what the fuck are you doing here?
[138:32.20]I have to go the other way.
[138:35.38]Well, that's just freaking fantastic.
[138:54.97]Person that's alive?
[138:57.43]Alive person?
[138:59.09]No?
[138:59.87]Yeah, that person's alive.
[139:04.08]Label your dressers for crying out loud.
[139:05.92]Let's see what he has to say.
[139:10.84]I guess this is where the magic happens.
[139:13.90]Chairs for an audience to watch.
[139:17.26]I only saw her afterwards.
[139:20.87]I couldn't have... The video cut off.
[139:25.69]We didn't hear what he said.
[139:30.35]You gotta wait for part two to know what he had to say.
[139:37.70]Uh... She's gonna get up and freak out and shit and start screaming and I'm gonna get scared.
[139:44.93]No, I'm not.
[139:45.35]This is a fucking straight face spring.
[139:47.71]Straight face stream.
[139:52.05]What the fuck is this?
[139:54.55]I was gonna say the same exact thing.
[139:55.77]I was gonna say, what the fuck is this?
[139:59.53]Ah, shit.
[140:02.47]Don't fall!
[140:03.45]Hey!
[140:09.58]It's in.
[140:16.26]You guys heard the music?
[140:24.18]Who just leaves a note like this?
[140:30.92]Alright, let's go.
[140:31.46]Not a good time for this.
[140:38.65]Back out into the Resident Evil 4 town.
[140:45.98]Resident Evil 4, except you don't have guns.
[140:50.94]Let's do Outlast 2.
[140:52.73]Colon.
[140:53.83]Resident Evil 4, but you don't have guns.
[141:14.31]No, like... And why?
[141:17.65]Where was this guy?
[141:19.93]What in the name of God?
[141:21.17]Get up the stairs, you fucking dummy.
[141:28.37]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[141:30.41]Crawl through.
[141:31.61]Go on.
[141:33.15]You can do it.
[141:34.63]I know you can do it.
[141:35.94]And you have to... I have to jump.
[141:36.96]Jump.
[141:38.04]Ah.
[141:39.64]This is just a series, a series of like fucking going into houses and jumping off.
[141:48.89]Is this the way to go?
[141:49.83]I have no fucking idea.
[141:51.35]I don't even know.
[141:56.58]I don't even, I don't even, I don't know.
[141:59.08]I don't know.
[141:59.52]We're going this way apparently.
[142:02.32]This is just go in house, get out of house, go in house again, jump off balcony, go in house.
[142:11.14]Am I getting attacked right now?
[142:12.96]Oh.
[142:13.96]That was just like a scary thing that I missed.
[142:20.51]Now where?
[142:23.07]Now where do we go?
[142:24.21]In this house.
[142:26.20]No, not in that house.
[142:27.26]Can't go in that house.
[142:41.76]This is dumb.
[142:56.59]This is fucking dumb.
[143:03.58]Anybody fucking scared yet?
[143:05.38]Or is everybody just like, this is fucking dumb?
[143:37.32]We are totally straight faced right now.
[143:41.30]Because we've just, this is just, this is just not, I don't, I don't, this is not, so far this is way worse than the first one.
[143:53.17]Here we go.
[143:53.67]Alright, here we go.
[144:15.21]I just... I don't... I'm not, like... This is... There's no, like... I'm not, like, scared of any of this.
[144:21.83]This is just, like... This is just annoying.
[144:24.65]Like, this isn't... This doesn't scare me.
[144:26.07]It's just, like... Let's just run away from the annoying guys.
[144:52.78]You're losing me, Outlast 2.
[144:57.82]You're really starting to lose me.
[144:59.08]This is like, come on now.
[145:01.36]You're losing me here.
[145:02.09]You guys are going to get up.
[145:24.40]There's the teacher.
[145:25.78]The school that I was in when I was younger.
[145:34.36]Are they gonna, like, burn this church down?
[145:43.01]Are we gonna... Are we going, like, back to, like, the school thing again?
[145:45.37]Uh...
[145:56.09]Don't be afraid.
[145:57.73]You're going to heaven.
[146:02.41]I'm not afraid.
[146:03.15]This backwards and forwards thing.
[146:10.95]It's like half the doors are backwards, half the doors are forwards.
[146:14.29]That is a cheap trick to make you fucking get stuck in rooms when you're getting chased.
[146:18.76]Cheap trick.
[146:20.06]I know plenty of magicians that do cheap tricks from software.
[146:23.84]Come on.
[146:41.76]Mmm, there's no pain in heaven.
[146:46.86]FromSoftware?
[146:47.60]Yeah, don't you know every game is made by FromSoftware?
[147:00.55]Okay, out here.
[147:02.03]I guess.
[147:10.04]I hope that was the right way to go.
[147:17.63]I think it was.
[147:18.33]Yeah, it was.
[147:24.20]Okay.
[147:28.47]Where do I get over there?
[147:30.21]I don't know.
[147:34.53]Hopefully this isn't the last Guardian thing over again.
[147:37.51]The last Guardian when I couldn't figure it out.
[147:39.63]Is that a battery?
[147:40.35]No, it's another piece of paper.
[147:41.37]More reading material.
[147:50.53]Yeah, I gotta push this.
[147:55.91]Do I plan on playing Prey?
[147:59.36]Probably not on stream.
[148:03.52]Although, it does look fairly fun.
[148:05.26]Where is this person again?
[148:13.93]I mean, like, left or right?
[148:15.05]I'm gonna go this way, apparently.
[148:17.45]I need batteries.
[148:27.93]If anybody has any, that would be really helpful.
[148:32.01]You jock-shock me right now.
[148:33.77]I don't need that.
[148:38.36]Batteries, batteries, batteries, batteries.
[148:39.78]Bandages.
[148:40.18]I don't need bandages.
[148:41.00]I need batteries.
[148:58.03]More fucking documents.
[149:07.84]Around this house, I guess.
[149:14.64]This door doesn't open.
[149:18.51]No, I can't get in any of these doors.
[149:21.57]There's like a little hole to go in.
[149:29.38]Full slide, okay.
[149:43.80]I'm sick of seeing the same wooden fences.
[149:57.25]I got around her apparently.
[149:58.83]Did I?
[149:59.17]I don't even know.
[149:59.79]I got back to here.
[150:01.41]There's like an anvil.
[150:11.86]I see a battery.
[150:12.74]I mean, I don't know, guys.
[150:16.08]I'm going to sneak in here and grab the document without her looking.
[150:18.68]I'm going to sneak into mom's room and steal money out of her purse.
[150:24.48]Let's read this.
[150:25.76]I ain't going to read that here.
[150:38.65]Okay, bye mom.
[150:40.79]See ya.
[150:42.27]It was fun.
[150:42.85]Hold on a second.
[150:56.72]I love how I'm just peeking out at her.
[151:00.58]It's always time to raid some other time.
[151:07.53]I can't get through here.
[151:08.63]I go this way, maybe?
[151:15.93]If I were to take a guess.
[151:22.58]I think I... Did I go in here already?
[151:25.92]Did I even go in here?
[151:26.78]I don't fucking remember.
[151:27.66]Every single fucking thing looks exactly the same in this fucking game, seriously.
[151:34.07]I'm straight in the house, apparently, or over here.
[151:38.37]Don't know.
[151:40.97]This is like a fucking maze.
[151:48.09]I got another battery, that's a good thing.
[151:51.37]Yeah, I read this already.
[151:52.75]I have no idea.
[151:57.24]How are you supposed to scare me in this fucking not scary irritating shitty game?
[152:03.08]Yeah, like I'm not even immersed anymore.
[152:05.07]I'm just walking around in circles looking at fucking wood.
[152:07.11]There's no way I'm gonna get scared now.
[152:12.03]I just called it a shitty game.
[152:13.23]It's not a shitty game.
[152:14.51]It's just not good.
[152:17.11]It's not a bad game.
[152:18.19]It's just a really, really bad fucking game.
[152:24.37]It's just this, it's just this, I've been doing this for like two and a half hours.
[152:28.35]I've been like running, I've been like running around looking at wood for two hours.
[152:33.98]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[152:36.16]People in chat, don't, don't do that.
[152:38.44]That would not be good.
[152:39.64]If people in chat are playing the game, they don't want to get it ruined.
[152:42.53]No spoilers.
[152:45.39]Is the spoiler, uh, you're like a fucking woodworker?
[152:49.63]Because that would be like a really... What on earth are you doing?
[152:52.82]Fuck.
[152:57.90]Uh, anyways.
[152:58.48]Uh... I don't know what the fuck to do.
[153:02.87]There's no way I'm gonna get scared now, remember.
[153:10.86]Well, I mean, like, I...
[153:14.18]I'm just walking around in circles.
[153:16.44]This is not scary.
[153:18.84]This is bogus.
[153:22.71]I remember when I was like, oh, how the fuck am I going to get back there?
[153:24.93]I don't know, guys.
[153:30.47]This is where I came from.
[153:39.29]Just rush B.
[153:51.19]I'm just like turned around, everything's dark.
[153:55.20]I already went in the hole in the fence.
[154:09.13]Let's just get back out around here.
[154:16.29]I wish there was a way to make it so like, hey, you've been doing this for like fucking 20 minutes now, don't use battery anymore.
[154:28.76]Try turning it off and turning it on again.
[154:30.08]Okay, well, right here.
[154:31.38]I don't even fucking care.
[154:43.57]I'll run it over with the fucking thing.
[154:46.68]Just trying to do my job, lady.
[154:53.77]And now I know why all this shit exists, right?
[154:56.27]Now I know why the hole in the fence exists.
[154:58.19]Come on.
[155:30.25]What the fuck was that?
[155:34.87]Can she see me when I do this?
[155:35.91]She can!
[156:06.98]YOU STUPID FUCKING GAME YOU ZERO OUT OF TEN GAME YOU FUCKING TWO OUT OF FUCKING TEN GAME
[156:54.90]Oh wow, you got smartened up, didn't you?
[158:15.09]I'm stuck on something.
[158:23.34]If I don't make this jump... I'm going to bed.
[158:33.40]Alright, don't have to go to bed.
[158:51.37]We made it.
[158:52.05]We made it.
[158:59.13]Hey, we made it.
[159:02.37]Watch out for the tricycle.
[159:05.63]Oh no, there's somebody that's- there's a dead person.
[159:11.33]I keep hearing the same Oblivion opening inventory scream.
[159:16.83]Well, here we go.
[159:17.29]We made it to the church.
[159:18.11]Let's see what he has to say.
[159:32.56]Good one-liner.
[159:33.46]Alright, here we go.
[159:36.52]Into the chapel we go.
[159:42.19]Anybody drop any batteries on their way out?
[159:44.35]Anybody have like a spare iPhone?
[159:49.63]I know, it's going in.
[159:50.45]Okay.
[160:06.47]Into the door.
[160:08.07]Backwards, not forwards.
[160:12.96]I hope somebody's in the confession booth.
[160:14.80]Can I go in the confession booth and, like, explain my sins?
[160:20.48]No, you just can hide.
[160:23.34]Oh, God.
[160:23.78]Judas is on his chest.
[160:31.25]My name's Blake.
[160:33.69]My name's Blake.
[160:36.51]I'm not anybody's father.
[160:37.79]I just killed me.
[160:40.44]Okay.
[160:40.54]Uh, how do I kill him?
[160:41.66]Do I like spin the wheel of death?
[161:11.64]Let me videotape him to death.
[161:12.88]Maybe that'll help.
[161:13.52]Let me set the fucking throne.
[161:15.62]Alright, well, you can stay alive for now, apparently.
[161:22.37]No, apparently not.
[161:25.21]Okay.
[161:38.35]But if I just picked him up and, like, put him in that torture device... He'd bore him to death.
[161:53.74]Oh, here he comes.
[161:55.86]Oh, no.
[161:56.28]There he is!
[161:59.02]There's, like, the fat frog guy!
[162:01.14]Mary...
[162:13.73]I won't be having any of this!
[162:18.15]I walked out of the door and died.
[162:21.70]I walked out.
[162:22.58]Did I bump my head on the ceiling?
[162:24.34]What the fuck was that?
[162:42.64]Okay, you have to watch.
[162:43.98]You have to watch, apparently.
[162:45.14]You can't skip it.
[162:47.46]Stop in the name of the law!
[162:51.50]Let me tell you something about what I was your age.
[162:57.19]She's gonna... This really is just like a... Yeah.

[163:08.43]Mary.
[163:09.95]Oh, God.
[163:12.73]Oh, no.
[163:13.29]There he is.
[163:13.77]I'm gonna get a good view.
[163:16.03]Oh, God, no.
[163:19.95]No, no, no.
[163:21.35]Now I got time to fucking cause...
[163:44.19]Why is that guy there?
[164:02.77]I thought that guy walked up to the fucking altar.
[164:05.01]Alright, we're just gonna watch, whatever.
[164:07.21]Mary?
[164:13.14]Oh, God.
[164:16.08]This is Groundhog Day.
[164:18.22]He can't see you.
[164:25.08]It's me, Josiah.
[164:26.58]Please, tell him I don't... Let her go.
[164:29.74]Oh, God, Mary, I'm sorry.
[164:32.86]I didn't want... God hates vanity.
[164:37.13]So do I.
[164:39.67]Screwdriver it's just like going out there We have only these few hours to find her and kill her and save this paradise from hell everlasting Where did Val take her
[165:06.19]They're gonna do the stretch machine on her.
[165:08.35]Tell him!
[165:08.93]You really fucking gonna let this happen, dude?
[165:37.44]Enemy of my enemies!
[165:38.48]Enemy of my enemies!
[165:39.54]Enemy of my enemies!
[165:40.78]Tell Josiah to make it stop.
[165:43.20]God ain't got ears for simple laws.
[165:46.33]Stop!
[165:47.75]Oh, God, please!
[165:50.35]Where is the woman?
[165:53.37]Where is the alterator?

[166:12.80]Up the mountain.
[166:13.62]Are we cracked?
[166:14.46]Valhazard in the mines.
[166:17.28]You'll never get her back.
[166:19.68]Not before the birth.
[166:22.14]We are the hands of the Lord.
[166:25.33]We cannot fail.
[166:30.02]Hey!
[166:30.80]He's like just doing, he's like bopping them.
[166:37.42]Oh my god.
[166:37.82]Well.
[166:38.28]Can I come out now?
[166:57.85]That was actually, that was a pretty decent, like, I'm gonna hit you in the chest, but I don't actually hurt you.
[167:05.13]They're working together.
[167:06.11]Where the fuck are the mites?
[167:17.50]Dammit.
[167:22.29]I tried to save these people, like, fucking five times, guys.
[167:27.98]The game wouldn't let me save them.
[167:31.09]Oh, not this shit again.
[167:32.33]Really?
[167:39.87]Open the fucking door.
[167:40.83]Open it.
[167:41.38]Open the door.
[167:42.12]And go.
[167:49.82]I don't even know where I'm running to right now.
[167:51.92]Where am I supposed to run to?
[167:56.71]I just went off a jump.
[167:58.25]I just went off a fucking jump.
[168:01.41]I went off a person jump.
[168:07.12]Nice fucking racing game.

[168:52.93]Oh, push forwards!
[168:53.79]Push backwards!
[168:54.53]Push forwards!
[168:55.37]Which way do you push?
[168:57.16]What a fucking game mechanic!
[168:59.10]Ooh, they won't know which way you have to push the door!
[169:07.60]Half the time it's forwards, and half the time it's fucking backwards!
[169:12.15]God, like, eat my fucking ass game, seriously.
[169:15.67]Oh, this one's forward, this one is backwards, though!
[169:33.90]I'm gonna have to jump again.
[169:42.26]Just click.
[169:43.00]I know, but sometimes it doesn't work!
[169:45.68]Sometimes he grabs the door and doesn't fucking... He lets go of it.
[169:53.44]Sometimes I'll press click and he'll like... Oh, I let go.
[170:13.04]Where am I?
[170:14.42]What have I done?
[170:17.36]Did I make it?

[171:20.75]The cactus.
[171:23.33]Are you serious?
[171:24.61]It was a cactus all along.
[171:28.91]Un-fucking-believable.
[171:30.89]That's unbelievable.
[171:34.34]How do I climb this?
[171:39.52]I'm getting, like, nauseous looking at this.

[173:12.18]I'm gonna be upset if it's the same lady.
[173:14.46]No, this is like, it's somebody with a baby.
[173:16.04]It's not even a real baby, it's gonna be one of these like, weird baby doll things.
[173:22.52]Okay, like, I can't jump over these, so I have to go around her.
[173:25.09]So you can turn around and grab me, right?
[173:26.53]Three, two, one, action.
[173:38.64]I locked this fucking door.
[173:44.33]No, they don't.
[173:44.95]How would you know?
[173:45.77]Why do they just know where I am?
[173:47.15]Can I hide in the basin?
[173:50.01]Is there anything in here?
[174:15.19]Can't I don't think I could do anything about this window apparently I'm gonna run into somebody cuz I'm going through a cornfield Right behind you what I mean, he's right behind you I

[174:43.85]This is just like, where am I going?
[174:46.77]Straight ahead to the streetlight?
[174:48.07]Alright, I made it to the streetlight.
[174:52.26]What's wrong with my character?
[175:06.65]Batteries?
[175:10.53]It's just a windmill.
[175:12.35]Just a windmill.
[175:15.71]I know it's not a windmill.
[175:16.93]Yeah, I know.
[175:21.69]Close this door.
[175:31.82]No batteries in here.
[175:37.02]This noise is not going to work because I can hear the... This is going to make all the noise.
[175:44.96]There's got to be a way to stop the wheel.
[175:47.78]Okay, that'll kill me if I do that.
[175:49.36]I already understand.
[175:50.28]Yeah, it's going to grab me by the chest and throw me around.
[175:53.90]That's fine.
[175:54.38]Okay, let's go.
[175:57.82]Can I wedge something in there?
[175:59.65]Maybe?
[176:04.41]Why is everything so dark?
[176:14.22]Stop the windmill.
[176:24.64]Oh, sorry, I forgot to pay for the headphone fee.
[176:26.90]Wow, getting to where- I'm getting that fucking headache right now, guys.
[176:31.45]Getting to where boat headphones is more expensive than Wi-Fi on a plane.
[176:34.75]Well, thank you for the ten bucks, Spaghetti.
[176:42.35]Thank you for the ten bucks twice.
[176:54.70]I know I can lock the doors, but who cares?
[176:57.57]It doesn't even matter.
[176:58.79]I know I can lock the doors, but it don't even fucking matter.
[177:08.24]There's not been a situation where I've gotten this far.
[177:24.71]Turn it down.
[177:25.31]Alright, so where's, like, the thing to put this in?
[177:29.35]In here?
[177:29.79]Can I, like, stuff it in there or something?
[177:33.54]I don't know.
[177:35.46]I can't do anything with that.
[177:39.10]Where's, like, this device's mechanism?
[177:41.27]I hear a person.
[177:41.93]There's a person in the room now.
[177:44.46]There's a guy with a flashlight in the room.
[177:46.08]There he is.
[177:47.24]There's the fucking groundskeeper.
[177:53.39]I guess I'm going this way.
[177:57.91]Oh, great.
[177:59.27]And he's going to come up the stairs.
[178:03.67]Can I, like, fucking dropkick this guy?
[178:05.13]I'm dead.
[178:05.89]No, I'm not.
[178:15.70]So dead.
[178:17.68]At least I know where it is now.
[178:24.03]This one dead.
[178:28.56]Fuck you!
[178:56.82]I don't, I don't, I don't even like, I don't, I don't even, you know, like anymore.
[179:08.56]Get the crank.
[179:14.50]Well, uh, like, I... I think I might be done.
[179:20.85]I think I might be done with Resident Evil fucking 8.
[179:29.22]I like, I'm like so irritated I don't even remember where I fucking got the crane.
[179:34.51]There's like a guy.
[179:37.83]Do I like still have the crane?
[179:39.49]I don't even know.
[179:43.17]Did I, was that from where I picked it?
[179:44.43]I don't even fucking remember.
[179:45.37]I apparently had it still.
[179:57.51]Wait, I need to turn that crane.
[180:01.70]You can't just install it, you need to turn it.
[180:06.84]Alright, once I get through these doors, I wanna get to the next point.
[180:20.03]Oh, goddammit.
[180:25.81]Slide underneath, go!
[180:28.31]That just actually startled me.
[180:31.26]Yes.
[180:32.78]That's the only scare you guys are gonna get.
[180:36.02]Is me getting startled by the door opening.
[180:43.67]Down here?
[180:44.05]Around the corner?
[180:45.75]I don't know.
[180:46.07]Alright, save point, come on.
[180:49.89]Get to the random clock in the sky.
[180:58.73]Hide in the sludge.
[181:02.14]Alright.
[181:03.48]I'm gonna take... I'm taking a break.
[181:06.69]I will see you dudes.
[181:08.35]Oh, let me just... Let me, like, save and exit here.
[181:13.17]I gotta take a break.
[181:15.05]This game's hurting my brain, and it's not even scary.
[181:19.45]I don't know.
[181:20.79]Outlast 2, 5.5 out of 10.
[181:23.34]If you like scary games, maybe you'll like it 5.9 out of 10.
[181:26.84]There you go.
[181:27.74]There's your laser review.
[181:30.02]Maybe like a 6.5, if you really like the whole setting there.
[181:33.98]5.1 out of 10.
[181:36.36]Anyways, guys, I will wave to the person in the background.
[181:41.53]Um...
[181:43.11]Take care.
[181:43.87]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[181:45.53]Might have a different plan tomorrow.
[181:46.71]I'm not sure if I'm going to play Outlast 2 anymore.
[181:50.49]It's got like a solid... It's got like a solid thumbs down and thumbs up.
[181:54.32]It's like this.
[181:55.32]You know what I mean?
[181:55.96]It's like a... It's like a game... Game sucks.
[181:59.08]But like... It's fine.
[182:02.62]Five is average.
[182:03.28]It's a failing grade, but...
[182:11.91]Oh, God.
[182:13.44]Oh, geez.
[182:14.72]Alright, well, guys, take care.
[182:16.76]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[182:18.50]We'll get something going tomorrow.
[182:20.50]New computer.
[182:21.06]Hopefully the stream looked good.
[182:22.06]Did the stream look good?
[182:23.35]Like, how was, like, the quality?
[182:24.97]Was it good?
[182:25.69]I'm sure it maybe looked a little better.
[182:26.93]Maybe?
[182:27.77]Maybe?
[182:29.09]But, yeah.
[182:29.81]Take care, guys.
[182:30.25]See you tomorrow.
[182:31.29]Have a good rest of your night.
[182:32.03]Goodbye.
[182:58.11]Did you really just give $100 when my stream is turning off?
[183:00.85]Are you crazy?
[183:02.35]Thank you, I Love Donuts, for the $100.
[183:03.59]Alright, have a good rest of your night.
[183:05.97]Goodbye.
[183:06.49]See you later.
[183:06.89]Thank you for the $100.
[183:07.53]Oh my god.
