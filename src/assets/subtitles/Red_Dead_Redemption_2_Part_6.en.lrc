[00:02.56]Alright.
[00:06.70]So.
[00:09.68]Let me... Yeah, we can hop in Red Dead.
[00:16.98]We'll jump in Red Dead for like an hour or two.
[00:19.19]So I can kind of prepare myself for tomorrow.
[00:24.29]Tomorrow being the multiplayer that I'm going to try and see if it's any fun.
[00:33.41]Red Dead 2.
[00:34.27]Incoming.
[00:44.26]What do you mean incoming?
[00:45.56]Red Ted 2.
[00:46.04]Here it comes.
[00:46.52]Red Ted 2.
[00:47.20]Red Ted.
[00:48.61]Red.
[00:49.65]Why can I not say words?
[00:51.17]I need to like eat something.
[00:55.57]Holy shit.
[01:03.66]If you stuck around just for... I was going to say Insane Aquarium.
[01:11.34]I really do need to eat something.
[01:12.82]Holy shit.
[01:14.44]I'm floating by right now for some reason.
[01:17.22]If you were there for Zoo Tycoon 2, thanks for coming out.
[01:22.81]Hopefully you stop by tomorrow when we play Red Dead Online.
[01:27.17]I'll see you soon.
[01:27.99]If not, I'll see you whenever you come back.
[01:33.17]Make the entire map of Red Dead 2 in Zoo Tycoon.
[01:37.65]Well, that is... That is just... That just ain't gonna happen.
[01:40.35]Let me boot up my PlayStation 4 here.
[01:46.78]Shouldn't take me more than about a minute or so to get this ready.
[01:55.94]Red Dead Redemption.
[02:02.91]Jesus, what a lazy guy.
[02:04.39]Did you know how long it takes to do stuff like that?
[02:08.71]It would take me like a year to do that.
[02:18.00]Alright, let me get this going.
[02:25.72]Yeah, we'll try to get like another couple of story missions done.
[02:33.56]Just so I can kind of familiarize myself with it again.
[02:35.65]Am I going to do any conventions this year?
[02:53.25]No.
[02:53.93]Not for the... If you mean 2019, then yeah.
[02:58.13]But... I'm ca... What?
[03:04.74]What is this?
[03:05.28]Why is this here?
[03:05.98]What's this for?
[03:09.24]I just turned on the PlayStation and this is what was here.
[03:15.54]I don't know why.
[03:16.28]Is this the last thing that you saw from two nights ago?
[03:25.31]Play it.
[03:40.24]I just put it on Red Dead.
[03:43.13]One more match
[04:06.95]Just make Red Dead characters?
[04:08.67]That's gonna take me like seven hours.
[04:10.69]I kinda wanna, ugh.
[04:33.42]No, I'm not gonna make Red Dead characters.
[04:42.85]I pressed the wrong button.
[04:47.72]No, no, no.
[04:50.98]Let's play Red Dead.
[04:52.76]Don't worry.
[04:53.88]You'll see this again sooner than you did last time.
[05:03.16]One match.
[05:03.71]Okay, we'll end on one match.
[05:05.57]How's that, Tom?
[05:10.37]I do want to get some Red Dead in, though.
[05:14.48]Yeah.
[05:15.84]We'll do that.
[05:21.83]Okay.
[05:27.10]Because that's going to take... To make characters... No, let's not peer-peer.
[05:37.24]Organized community rumbles?
[05:39.76]Um, the reason why I don't really do them that often is because... It kind of loses its... The reason why it's so special to me and to the community in general is because... I put a shitload of time into making a ton of characters and there needs to be enough... Can I just play it now?
[06:08.30]No.
[06:10.28]No.
[06:12.12]There needs to be enough time has to pass for there to be new characters to make.
[06:16.42]Because sure, I could just make a bunch of people from before, from older games, and throw them in, or older rumbles.
[06:25.99]But I like the idea of each one having a significant amount of people that were, you know, new ideas, new characters, new interesting things.
[06:36.83]Over the course of 6 to 12 months.
[06:46.91]And eventually transitioning away from the video game because as a lot of you guys know I desperately want to make another live one but this time actually do it live.
[07:04.06]I've hinted at it talked about it a little bit
[07:13.14]Like do a live Rumble, like for real, like an actual live Jerma Rumble 2 live streamed.
[07:28.81]Live CGI Rumble?
[07:30.25]No, it would be... There's a lot... The resources that are available on this side of the country, it wouldn't be that hard of a thing to do.
[07:43.88]Alright, what was the last thing I did?
[07:45.32]I don't know if it's been so long!
[07:53.74]Who's gonna be on the... Who's gonna be at that rumble?
[07:58.85]I mean, that's... I'm not gonna... Why would I tell you that?
[08:01.65]I can't, like, tell you all the secrets.
[08:02.95]Am I gonna tell you every single secret?
[08:04.55]Alright, let's open up the map and see where the hell we are.
[08:11.38]So, I gotta go...
[08:15.38]Here's Micah, which I've not done.
[08:19.89]Still have not completed that mission.
[08:22.11]I don't think I'm gonna.
[08:25.61]This is what we left off.
[08:32.03]Oh, should I just do it?
[08:34.65]No.
[08:35.19]I don't want to do that.
[08:37.12]Let's go... Is there a stagecoach over here?
[08:41.92]Trapper, post office...
[08:44.67]Stagecoach.
[08:46.07]Let's ride the stagecoach.
[08:48.13]To build.
[08:49.21]Yeah, this is single player.
[08:50.17]I don't have access to the multiplayer until tomorrow.
[08:54.45]So, I just wanted to familiarize myself with the... With the game.
[09:02.77]Again.
[09:06.29]Because then tomorrow, I'm gonna stream the multiplayer.
[09:13.12]Is it familiar yet?
[09:15.62]You could say that, yeah.
[09:17.96]You know, it took 10 seconds to get there.
[09:26.56]So now we can go across this way.
[09:29.05]My horse is in desperate need of... yummy cakes.
[09:35.89]Alright, let's go.
[09:44.05]The story gets real good.
[09:45.05]It's worth finishing.
[09:46.03]Yeah, that's what I've heard.
[09:49.33]I think when we stopped, that was 40-50% of the way done.
[09:55.67]Was that just about the 40% mark?
[10:03.57]You gonna finish L.A.?
[10:04.57]No, I'm not gonna finish L.A.
[10:05.73]Noire.
[10:07.80]We talked about L.A.
[10:08.46]Noire.
[10:11.22]But it's not...
[10:14.91]L.A.
[10:15.05]Noire is a really, really great game.
[10:18.47]But I could... What?
[10:27.58]Did I do that?
[10:28.22]I didn't do that, did I?
[10:29.00]I didn't do anything.
[10:31.92]What did I do?
[10:32.54]I didn't do anything.
[10:37.19]Do you want to overwrite the data?
[10:38.41]I guess...
[10:51.50]That horse is... Is that horse better than this horse?
[10:55.92]Wait, what?
[10:58.96]Uh... Well, this is a good horse, apparently.
[11:15.73]I mean, that is...
[11:21.09]It's not stealing if the guy's dead.
[11:24.72]In the Wild West, that is.
[11:25.70]You gonna let me on?
[11:34.24]Yeah, this is gonna work.
[11:38.41]It's also a murderer.
[11:40.39]The horse is a murderer.
[11:46.25]I'm not a murderer.
[11:47.77]Not yet, at least.
[11:48.38]Not now.
[11:52.56]Gonna let me... Okay.
[11:55.98]I kind of need to take this horse somewhere, though, don't I?
[12:03.65]Follow me.
[12:05.17]Is there a stable here?
[12:07.15]Because if there is, then I could at least stable this one.
[12:22.45]Hey there, Whisper!
[12:28.55]Can you only have four?
[12:29.39]I think you can only have three or four horses, yeah?
[12:32.47]Something like that.
[12:40.76]This thing is fast.
[12:43.42]Alright, cool.
[12:46.36]Uh, how much money do I have?
[12:47.08]Because I can pay my bounty.
[12:49.70]But is there a stable?
[12:55.73]What did I just do?
[12:59.41]What did I do?
[13:01.56]Oh, I ran a guy over!
[13:02.96]I ran that guy over!
[13:05.46]What?
[13:10.20]Oh, come on.
[13:11.76]No, no, get away from me!
[13:16.73]I forgot how to fucking melee fight.
[13:32.00]Always check your blind spots.
[13:33.32]I just slid into that dude.
[13:38.52]Fucking hell.
[13:50.75]He slid into that guy's DMs.
[13:57.50]I'm gonna pay the bounty.
[14:05.45]I didn't even know what happened.
[14:06.47]That guy was like a squirrel.
[14:08.05]I road killed a guy and I didn't even know he was there.
[14:12.71]Was he sleeping on the ground?
[14:13.89]Look at that.
[14:25.48]That's what every criminal says.
[14:28.46]Well, I'm not a criminal.
[14:29.40]I just... I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[14:33.04]I wasn't even going that fast either.
[14:40.56]Alright, here we go.
[14:41.10]I'm going to go pay the bounty.
[14:43.60]I'm going to go take care of everything.
[14:46.56]Go to the story mission.
[14:50.18]Cool.
[14:56.46]Would you like you to stable this horse?
[14:59.33]There we go.
[15:00.73]Alright, I'm going to name it.
[15:01.43]So I've got Horsebag Sonic, Whisper Thunder, and then... Actually...
[15:09.10]This horse is way better.
[15:10.23]This horse is fucking 10 times better.
[15:11.85]It's alright.
[15:21.05]Who am I taking out?
[15:22.19]This is... No, actually, I want to... Give me Whisper.
[15:30.55]Wow, name him Skateboard for what?
[15:38.87]Saddle up.
[15:41.73]Alright, let's do services.
[15:44.53]Horse care package.
[15:50.74]Name him something.
[15:51.82]Epic gamer?
[15:52.54]What do you mean?
[15:53.92]Alright, let's pay the bounty, take the stage, coach.
[15:59.84]And get the absolute hell out of here.
[16:12.84]How many bits do you have to spend to name him Skateboard?
[16:16.15]Get out of my fucking way!
[16:19.15]Everyone just gets in my way!
[16:26.71]No!
[16:27.49]I'm about- can I- how do I say please take me and take me to the jail?
[16:34.46]Where's the please take me to jail?
[16:42.13]That guy just spun around in a circle on the bridge.
[16:44.25]Look, I'm here.
[16:45.31]I'm ready to take everything.
[16:47.28]I'll be held accountable for all of it.
[17:13.88]Did I just die?
[17:17.05]Wait, what?
[17:18.51]Oh, okay.
[17:22.91]I was going to say, how the fuck?
[17:29.35]Yeah, I thought he instantly killed me.
[17:40.88]So did I pick... You don't lose anything by going to jail, do you?
[17:47.30]Does that not include my bounty?
[17:54.47]Did my bounty paid?
[18:05.53]My guns are gone?
[18:06.27]No, they're not.
[18:13.18]No, I'm good.
[18:14.32]I got all my weapons.
[18:16.71]Springfield rifle, bolt action rifle.
[18:21.22]Yeah, please don't scare me like that.
[18:26.18]If I run another person over.
[18:29.48]Alright, I need to go to the stagecoach.
[18:36.61]Stagecoach, let's go.
[18:38.11]And then I need to go from here to here.
[18:43.88]So we're going to go to roads.
[18:46.33]Rhodes Ranch!
[18:53.89]Uh, I probably could... I need to turn it up a little bit.
[18:57.77]There we are.
[18:58.29]That probably sounds a little better.
[19:00.81]What the heck?
[19:17.41]So... Don't steal it!
[19:37.39]I haven't played the game in like almost two weeks.
[19:41.13]So I'm sorry.
[19:42.21]I like bumped into a guy.
[19:43.67]I bumped into another guy.
[19:55.62]For the love of God, just go there yourself.
[19:58.44]Where's the fence?
[20:04.70]He's up here.
[20:08.59]Is there another wagon fence?
[20:10.75]This is so far away.
[20:17.69]This is so fucking far away.
[20:24.24]He's easy.
[20:25.06]I'm gonna spend the whole time breaking the laws.
[20:28.36]I need to wait till this is gone.
[20:35.70]What the hell is that?
[20:44.27]Coyotes?
[20:45.57]Going after a rabbit?
[20:49.19]Yeah, that is what it is.
[20:57.20]No, what if I bring this back?
[20:59.94]I'm gonna bring this back to the guy that I just took it from.
[21:15.82]I found it.
[21:16.56]Look, it's right here.
[21:26.91]I just wanted to say good morning.
[21:30.53]Alright.
[21:40.60]Your stagecoach is back.
[21:46.33]Let's go ahead and take a ride.
[21:47.91]Rhodes Range.
[21:52.51]See?
[21:57.68]Where's the, I crashed into a tree joke?
[21:59.92]There, I didn't, there is no crash into tree joke.
[22:02.41]I already fell down a cliff.
[22:16.82]Does that count?
[22:17.86]I'm not sure.
[22:30.63]Alright, let's do it.
[22:32.23]Time for a mission.
[22:33.93]It only took us 25 minutes.
[22:35.83]A little less than that.
[22:37.41]Not very much.
[22:38.48]Alright, talk to Bill.
[22:46.80]Come on, that's classic.
[22:49.20]I didn't do it this time.
[22:50.66]The horse did.
[22:55.15]Cartoon Jerma crashes into a tree.
[23:03.05]Ayayay.
[23:06.69]Oh, well, it's a really good thing somebody said that.
[23:13.22]Thank you for saying that, because... My microphone was not correctly synced up.
[23:23.46]Now it isn't.
[23:25.34]It was almost a full millisecond fine.
[23:34.64]How's it now?
[23:35.04]Let's see.
[23:35.38]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[23:36.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[23:36.88]Should be good.
[24:03.33]I couldn't watch with the delay.
[24:04.55]I'm so sorry.
[24:05.20]I didn't realize that we just came from a PC game, so... Through my capture card, it's a 650 millisecond delay.
[24:12.52]So I have to offset the mic, so sorry about that.
[24:27.86]Hey, Bill!
[24:30.28]I need a word with you, Morgan.
[24:35.19]What can I do for you?
[24:38.63]We got something cooking you might be interested in.
[24:41.25]I'm gonna like the sound of this.
[24:43.35]Been cooking since Horseshoe, but you went and kicked up all that commotion at Valentine.
[24:48.36]Now, we was preparing to rob the bank there until you got involved in all that nonsense, and I don't know.
[24:53.98]I just feel like it's unfinished business.
[24:56.06]That wasn't my fault.
[24:57.40]It was just one of them things.
[24:59.00]How come every time I get in trouble, I'm called a fool and an idiot?
[25:03.40]But when you get in trouble, oh, it's just one of them things.
[25:06.96]It's a good point, Arthur.
[25:08.68]Very good point.
[25:09.52]Alright, well what do y'all want me to do?
[25:13.53]Hit the goddamn bank with us!
[25:15.23]I love my nerf bullet.
[25:16.85]My backup nerf bullets.
[25:18.11]You really think it's worth going back there?
[25:20.71]Four of us can hit the bank easy.
[25:22.59]Did I make that joke two weeks ago?
[25:23.91]I might have.
[25:24.91]Did I say that two weeks ago?
[25:27.41]I definitely did, didn't I?
[25:29.13]It's been two weeks, guys.
[25:31.01]If we go in quick and quiet, we can hit it just fine.
[25:34.46]If there's four of us, I mean.
[25:37.12]Y'all think it's worth the risk?
[25:39.04]It's a bank, Arthur.
[25:40.84]So?
[25:42.38]Is the take good?
[25:44.12]According to the fella I met, yes.
[25:46.22]It's the end of the stock sales.
[25:47.94]Plenty of money and plenty of people mailing about.
[25:53.91]Okay, I suppose.
[25:56.03]It's worth taking a look at least.
[25:57.71]I'm gonna be performing.
[25:58.63]I better go get changed out of these rides.
[26:00.69]Give me a minute, gentlemen.
[26:01.89]Okay.
[26:03.19]So, Bill, this better be good.
[26:05.56]It is good.
[26:06.74]We put a lot of research into this one.
[26:08.76]I hope so.
[26:12.63]Mr. Morgan.
[26:14.22]Where are my clothes?
[26:15.93]Did we all change?
[26:17.21]Where are my clothes?
[26:45.39]Is Red Dead Redemption 2 a sequel?
[26:47.81]It is a... It is a prequel.
[26:52.65]It's a prequel.
[26:57.73]You ever see Star Wars The Phantom Menace?
[27:03.16]It's like that.
[27:06.83]There's only one difference, though.
[27:08.46]It does not take place in Star Wars.
[27:10.06]I know that can be kind of confusing at first glance, but...
[27:23.76]Like I said, we'll see how it looks.
[27:27.46]If we can get in alright, we'll send Miss Jones back to the bank.
[27:30.84]Darth Morgan.
[27:32.48]Yep.
[27:32.86]They won't recognize her.
[27:34.52]I'll show you boys how it's done.
[27:38.04]What are you thinking this time?
[27:40.08]I don't know.
[27:40.72]That wasn't even my fault.
[27:41.72]Fellers always liked a lost little girl, but nobody plays a drunken harlot boy like me.
[27:46.47]He should work.
[27:48.95]Once he's got them distracted, we'll move in.
[27:52.83]Jerma is the new Jar Jar.
[27:54.83]How dare you say that to me.
[27:56.07]How dare you say something like that.
[27:59.15]It was inconsiderate.
[28:00.52]It was rude.
[28:01.04]It was untrue.
[28:11.45]That was very rude.
[28:13.53]Banned that guy.
[28:14.17]Nobody gets banned for making a reference to Star Wars.
[28:17.61]He's trying to run me off the road.
[28:19.35]Slow down.
[28:36.37]He needs Star Trek.
[28:37.87]Uh, well, Star Trek...
[28:55.19]Can't believe you got me going back to Valentine.
[28:59.33]Don't tell me it ain't hurt you leaving that bank behind.
[29:02.07]What do I think about sand?
[29:03.13]Not really.
[29:03.82]Work a town and not hit the bank?
[29:05.76]The desert?
[29:06.62]The beach?
[29:07.10]That's downright pathetic.
[29:09.24]I guess we went a bit beyond working it.
[29:12.38]We shot the place to hell.
[29:14.87]You did, Morgan.
[29:16.59]What do I think about Sans from Undertale?
[29:22.11]I mean, it's a character in the game.
[29:38.26]I don't know what to tell you.
[29:40.12]Surprised you ain't already ripped me about that dynamite again.
[29:42.38]This is a pretty great loading screen.
[29:43.70]Yeah, it is.
[29:44.56]One mistake, and I'll never live it down.
[29:47.00]That looks really, really cool.
[29:47.90]Look at that.
[29:48.26]What do you need?
[29:49.44]Pat on the back.
[29:50.26]It's beautiful.
[29:52.10]Just know I got the lead on this one.
[29:55.47]We'll see about that once things get going.
[30:00.51]Not paying attention is a bingo for me.
[30:02.67]So, thinking this through.
[30:04.17]Are you paying attention?
[30:05.67]Drop Cornwall's train.
[30:08.22]We shoot a heap of his men in violent time.
[30:11.49]We rob his stagecoach.
[30:13.31]This is just dawning on you now.
[30:15.63]And now, we're going back to the one place he knew where to find us.
[30:20.87]That's the genius of it.
[30:23.43]Folk never look at what's right under their nose.
[30:26.16]I know what's gonna happen.
[30:27.28]I ain't sure that's always true.
[30:30.14]What's happened to you?
[30:32.34]You're getting real nervy in your old age.
[30:35.13]The last few weeks haven't.
[30:37.65]Forget about Cornwall.
[30:39.67]Forget about Cornwall.
[30:40.61]He can't have many men left at this point.
[30:43.53]Got a bit hairy in that barn, but we all walked away fine from that.
[30:48.91]Whoa, that was weird.
[30:50.87]If four of us could deal with them in Valentine, and four of us could deal with them after the coach robbery, I ain't too worried.
[31:00.22]If you say so.
[31:02.57]Quit messing with the cord.
[31:03.71]I'm running into a rough patch here, for some reason.
[31:21.69]Don't celebrate too early.
[31:23.03]Yeah, I don't really...
[31:38.78]This music is very appropriate for the tension.
[31:40.47]Maybe if your camera was off, it would work a little more smoothly.
[31:52.59]I don't have my camera.
[31:53.53]What do you mean, camera?
[32:01.19]Up the contrast a little bit.
[32:08.20]I don't think the stream's gonna die.
[32:10.82]I think we may have just hit a little bit of a rough patch.
[32:31.70]Famous last words.
[32:45.03]How come they're not talking anymore?
[32:46.85]Good morning.
[32:48.87]Hello.
[32:53.62]Next frame, please.
[32:55.60]OK.
[32:56.86]Let's leave the horses here off the main drive.
[32:59.46]Whoa.
[33:02.02]Whoa.
[33:02.38]Alright, gentlemen.
[33:04.84]Here we are.
[33:06.20]OK.
[33:06.40]Get ready.
[33:12.72]Alright, you ready?
[33:13.48]Let's do it.
[33:15.64]I am prepared.
[33:16.14]PowerPoint Red Dead.
[33:19.14]Ooh.
[33:19.26]That.
[33:39.36]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[33:40.46]What routine?
[33:41.44]Uh, I think... Drunken harlot.
[33:43.87]No, it must have been the green screen man.
[33:45.85]Tch.
[34:05.77]That's pretty good.
[34:06.45]She's pretty good.
[34:07.95]Good luck, gentlemen.
[34:09.53]We got this.
[34:12.35]I've never seen anyone not pick the harlot.
[34:15.60]I know.
[34:17.20]I'm 100% certain that every stream you've ever seen do this.
[34:19.92]Was harlot.
[34:20.44]Until he lands.
[34:21.36]Okay.
[34:36.62]Am I ready to burst through here?
[34:39.08]There we go.
[34:42.12]Nobody move.
[34:44.48]Don't make us hurt you.
[34:47.10]Get on the ground.
[34:47.70]Good.
[34:47.92]Here.
[34:48.66]Unlock the door.
[34:50.93]Nice toss.
[34:52.33]Elizabeth.
[34:53.89]Ammo.
[34:54.83]It's unlocked.
[34:55.53]We're good.
[35:00.15]Are you serious?
[35:01.09]No.
[35:01.33]Come on.
[35:04.97]Open that vault right now.
[35:06.17]Open it!
[35:07.11]Is he pretending?
[35:34.80]I'm just fucking with his concentration.
[35:38.02]I'm making him start over again.
[35:43.40]He's got it, right?
[35:50.55]Open the safe!
[35:54.53]Am I actually resetting him?
[35:59.95]That was... I didn't do that, he did.
[36:02.96]Alright, here we go.
[36:03.54]Come in!
[36:04.98]Someone come make sure the chute behaves himself in here.
[36:08.95]What do we need?
[36:09.37]What are we looking for?
[36:11.03]Open the lockboxes now!
[36:13.29]The manager does that.
[36:17.51]If he doesn't know, we can't hold this against him.
[36:19.57]This guy's getting hit in the head so many times, he's going to forget who he is.
[36:23.04]Crack them or blow them up.
[36:24.32]Keep an eye out.
[36:25.66]I'll be as quick as I can.
[36:28.06]Crack.
[36:28.83]Crack the safes.
[36:32.03]Why did I do that?
[36:32.57]I should have blown him up.
[36:35.11]I should have blown him up.
[36:36.39]I should have blown him up.
[36:39.15]Oh, no.
[36:39.73]I should have blown him up.
[36:40.45]I should have blown him up.
[37:10.91]How much time do you think we got?
[37:12.57]I almost got one.
[37:13.64]I almost got one.
[37:16.04]I almost have one.
[37:19.42]Okay, I got one.
[37:23.34]Come on, come on.
[37:25.30]I hear people out there.
[37:26.20]Me too.
[37:27.50]Only five more to go.
[37:28.48]We need to move this along.
[37:29.73]That's so much money.
[37:30.53]Okay, hold on.
[37:31.25]I gotta actually pay attention to this.
[37:32.67]Go on as fast as I can.
[37:34.15]This is slower, but it's quieter.
[37:36.47]Okay.
[37:37.57]Hey, watch him there.
[37:38.49]Don't worry.
[37:39.85]I see him.
[37:43.30]Come on, find it, Arthur.
[37:44.42]That was quick.
[37:48.40]That was three grand.
[37:52.09]How much is in this one?
[37:54.03]Three grand in every one of them?
[37:55.95]Four thousand.
[37:56.65]Holy shit.
[37:57.11]I had it.
[38:15.65]I'm trying to go too fast.
[38:26.22]You motherfucker, open!
[38:33.60]Right here, right here, right here, right here, right here, right here!
[38:35.70]Right here!
[38:45.36]Come on.
[38:45.88]I only have two more to get.
[38:48.00]I got the first one quick.
[38:49.20]Here it comes.
[38:50.50]Come on.
[38:50.86]Right here.
[38:51.52]I went through the whole thing.
[38:53.38]Fuck.
[38:53.64]Two.
[38:54.78]Here's three.
[38:56.12]Right here.
[38:58.06]I just had it.
[38:58.48]It was 60.
[38:58.74]Was it 60?
[39:15.68]Yep.
[39:23.24]Blow up the last two?
[39:30.93]No, I got it.
[39:31.45]I got it.
[39:31.71]I got it.
[39:31.99]I don't need to explode anything.
[39:34.87]I just missed it.
[39:35.33]It was right there.
[39:42.41]It's right here.
[39:44.06]Right here.
[39:47.76]It's right here.
[39:48.86]It's right here.
[39:49.90]Got it.
[39:50.42]Told you.
[39:50.70]Got them all.
[40:04.55]That's it, right?
[40:09.01]Is it as simple as it seems?
[40:10.88]Uh, fairly.
[40:12.86]Fairly simple.
[40:18.34]How are we doing on frames?
[40:20.42]Did you kill the bag teller?
[40:22.76]You did.
[40:23.02]He got hit in the head one too many times.
[40:28.39]He didn't have anything on him either.
[40:29.29]I bet I shouldn't have hit him three or four times.
[40:35.53]I think... I think we're fine.
[40:39.09]Come on, I'll lead the way.
[40:40.29]Let's go.
[40:41.85]Everybody stay calm.
[40:46.47]I think we just ran into a... It's like a rough patch.
[40:51.43]I don't think it's an actual issue.
[40:52.93]I'm speaking very, very cautiously on that, but... Are we just calmly walking out of here?
[41:03.69]Someone's robbed the bank.
[41:10.53]Alright, well, we gotta go.
[41:12.19]And look!
[41:12.99]Look!
[41:13.11]Over there!
[41:15.14]Oh, it's Lawmen!
[41:18.92]My fortress got shot.
[41:20.98]That's not good.
[41:25.63]Dead or alive?
[41:26.39]Out, out, out, let's go.
[41:29.47]Everybody has to live.
[41:30.21]I'm gonna take a different weapon out here.
[41:34.47]I want... the... yeah, repeater.
[41:40.81]Maybe I won't need to shoot anybody.
[41:42.48]The weapon's good to get out of here.
[41:44.99]That'd be pretty swell, actually.
[41:46.07]That'd be pretty great.
[41:48.39]Maybe I'll have to get up, though, so I don't want to go too far ahead of everybody.
[41:54.40]They're ahead of us.
[42:00.74]I forgot how to use that eye.
[42:02.52]I forgot how it works.
[42:03.26]I had to hit R1.
[42:14.15]I remember now.
[42:15.31]I can't wait to play this online.
[42:22.38]This is going to be so much fun.
[42:24.12]Has anybody watched any of the online?
[42:30.28]Is it fun?
[42:33.86]Is it cool?
[42:34.64]Is it interesting?
[42:35.38]Or is it just dumb?
[42:45.78]It's pretty fun.
[42:48.41]That's good.
[42:49.39]Let's get one headshot and then how about two if I can get it.
[43:03.73]It looks okay from what's there now.
[43:06.21]It actually has a story.
[43:09.45]That's cool.
[43:11.33]It still is the beta.
[43:12.59]That's, yeah, that's great.
[43:14.39]Not the big thing.
[43:15.45]I'm very interested in how it's gonna turn out.
[43:20.99]Because GTA Online was cool, but... It felt really unfinished.
[43:27.52]In a lot of ways.
[43:33.77]Thanks I'm so glad that didn't happen because I would have had to do the whole thing over again
[43:58.58]And I would have been really upset.
[43:59.74]I would have gone, what?
[44:00.84]No!
[44:01.08]I have to do the whole thing again?
[44:02.68]What the fuck, dude?
[44:03.50]I'm just messing around.
[44:05.43]That should be happy.
[44:06.99]Even if it did come with a heap of trouble.
[44:08.69]Ah, it was fun.
[44:10.95]Maybe you're right.
[44:12.69]Now, go on.
[44:13.53]Get out of here.
[44:14.13]I have some other business to attend to.
[44:15.97]Holy shit.
[44:16.39]It's taken this guy two weeks to get through chapter two.
[44:19.30]I haven't played it.
[44:22.60]I haven't really put any time into it.
[44:24.14]I've been too busy with other stuff.
[44:26.76]Too many other things going on.
[44:33.21]Ride to the ranch.
[44:46.16]Still in Anor Londo, I see.
[44:47.82]I kinda miss that game.
[44:51.74]I miss souls.
[44:58.22]I really do.
[45:03.66]Sekiro's gonna be so much fun.
[45:05.16]It looks great.
[45:11.46]Have I played Bloodborne before?
[45:12.80]Um, you are referencing probably my favorite single-player video game ever made.
[45:23.27]Did somebody say Bloodborne?
[45:24.59]Oh, now you're gonna get him started.
[45:27.13]Now he's not gonna stop talking about it.
[45:33.99]Here we go.
[45:34.83]Now it starts.
[45:36.83]He's not gonna stop.
[45:38.68]Yeah, I have not beat it on stream.
[45:44.36]That is true.
[45:47.58]But I'm excited for a lot of things, actually.
[45:54.60]Like I told you guys earlier in the stream.
[45:59.47]I want pretty much every other weekend or so, or once a month, to not only do new games that are coming out, but more stuff that you've never seen before.
[46:12.23]From me, at least.
[46:14.64]There's another thing coming up at the end of December.
[46:17.40]That should be a lot of fun.
[46:18.44]Tons of games coming out at the beginning of the year.
[46:21.30]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[46:23.18]I can't wait.
[46:23.47]My husband's not cold on the ground and you've come back here.
[46:26.25]Archie, I nearly paid off what was owed.
[46:29.01]Your husband knew the rules when he took that money.
[46:31.73]Now, I'm real sorry about the way things turned out.
[46:34.73]But he had a choice.
[46:35.69]It ain't my fault about the way the world is.
[46:37.81]He didn't have a choice.
[46:39.62]He was good and he did good.
[46:42.26]There wasn't no choice in that.
[46:44.42]Stop hogging the internet?
[46:45.48]Well, we just dropped like... two or three thousand frames about five minutes ago, so... I'm not sure why we're... having internet issues at the moment.
[47:14.62]Well, maybe when your mother's finished mourning your father, I'll keep her in black on your behalf.
[47:21.35]You think on that, boy?
[47:22.81]Well, maybe you shall, sir.
[47:24.35]And maybe other events will transpire.
[47:27.11]You best stick to them books because mark my words on this.
[47:30.59]Vengeance is an idiot's gain.
[47:32.61]Ah, Mrs. Downs, thank you for your punctuality.
[47:35.59]It's next to godliness, isn't it?
[47:38.05]That's cleanliness.
[47:39.48]I'll have to take your word on that.
[47:42.72]Good day.
[47:48.07]Yeah, I told you I was gonna play Lego Island.
[47:49.49]I was gonna build a computer to play Lego Island.
[47:55.30]I got a Raspberry Pi.
[47:58.04]But you can't even install it on there.
[47:59.48]I was gonna just build a fucking computer.
[48:07.21]You don't like my Arthur?
[48:08.01]I think I just put random clothes on him.
[48:34.01]Christmas dinner cooking stream.
[48:37.99]No.
[48:41.33]Ten.
[48:41.55]Did I just get three grand?
[48:49.01]Holy shit.
[48:49.98]The camp just took $10,000 from that?
[48:53.28]I've been donating hundreds of dollars a week to the camp.
[49:01.58]I thought you were playing that zoo game.
[49:03.08]I was.
[49:04.97]And then, after like four hours or so, it was... We kind of saw the things that we wanted to see.
[49:10.79]So I have to go do Micah now, don't I?
[49:16.26]I actually have to do this.
[49:17.46]Alright, let me see... I think I have all the upgrades though, don't I?
[49:31.89]I'm 95% certain that I have the upgrades.
[49:39.82]Everyone's calling my name.
[49:41.66]I'm busy.
[49:42.14]I got places to be, man.
[49:42.96]I'm gonna eat some food.
[49:45.95]This is a sexy Santa cosplay.
[50:06.23]I didn't say that.
[50:06.95]Somebody... I didn't say that.
[50:08.07]Somebody said that.
[50:08.77]Somebody else said that.
[50:10.29]I was just responding to somebody in chat.
[50:12.37]How are we all doing?
[50:20.28]No, I don't play Dominoes.
[50:21.22]I don't know how to play Dominoes.
[50:28.28]Okay.
[50:29.83]So.
[50:31.13]Let's do some cleaning here.
[50:34.93]Shave my face.
[50:37.72]Maybe just a little maybe just a tad No No No, just give him a long chin No, I want to keep the whole thing
[51:07.10]How do I grow more hair?
[51:08.38]Is there a way?
[51:15.60]Is there a way for me just to have the beard go all the way to 10?
[51:20.15]Hair tonic?
[51:20.73]Just drink hair tonic?
[51:22.87]No, you put hair tonic on, you don't consume it.
[51:25.41]Let's take some ammo.
[51:34.52]Drink?
[51:34.94]Yeah, drink the tonic.
[51:40.87]Stops you from getting hairy insides.
[51:45.69]I've been doing it so wrong this whole time.
[51:47.43]Alright.
[51:54.76]Micah, are you the last mission?
[51:56.94]You know what?
[51:57.98]No, fuck Micah.
[52:00.19]Let's go do the other side mission thing.
[52:03.79]Let's do it.
[52:04.25]Let's go do this.
[52:29.42]Or is it on the map here?
[52:36.40]What the hell is it?
[52:40.31]Was it even on the map?
[52:41.27]Maybe it wasn't.
[52:41.79]I mean, I can donate this.
[52:48.35]I thought I had another mission to do.
[52:49.71]I guess not.
[52:51.43]I'll do it.
[52:59.32]How long is the stream going to be?
[53:02.70]Maybe like another... I'll do like one more mission and then we'll probably call it a night.
[53:06.44]I'm going to start fairly early, I think, tomorrow.
[53:11.19]Because I want to... I want to get started with the online.
[53:13.77]WWE?
[53:13.91]Yeah, we'll do one match.
[53:15.99]Alright, gentlemen.
[53:30.58]We'll do one... one match.
[53:34.12]Dad lied to us.
[53:35.15]No, I'm telling you, I'm gonna do one.
[53:36.45]I'll do one match.
[53:42.21]Upgrade?
[53:42.71]I have all the upgrades already.
[53:45.33]Unless they changed.
[53:46.19]Let me take a look.
[53:58.47]Make Arthur Morgan in WWE.
[54:01.66]I usually kill all the Driscolls too.
[54:04.79]Buy the mech suit upgrade.
[54:29.77]$32 returned.
[54:30.33]Alright, let's take a look at the ledger.
[54:33.33]I don't know if I... Yeah, I can restock.
[54:43.64]I'll restock.
[54:48.04]Why not?
[54:51.63]Bought everything else.
[54:55.95]Buy that.
[54:58.70]Buy that.
[54:59.70]I bought everything else.
[55:03.10]I have the boat too.
[55:08.90]Really needed that, didn't I?
[55:16.31]Upgrade everything?
[55:16.91]I already did.
[55:19.01]Did you buy fast travel?
[55:20.55]Uh, I think I do because I upgraded his tent, right?
[55:25.73]Shave his head.
[55:30.02]Alright.
[55:30.56]Let's go.
[55:31.22]I'm gonna go do the Micah mission.
[55:38.42]Because it's there and I have to do it at some point.
[55:59.98]Might as well just get it done.
[56:05.03]We'll do the Micah mission, and then we'll do a... We'll do a match... We'll do another, like, backstage brawl in WWE.
[56:16.26]I'm thinking about who I'd want to be.
[56:21.44]Fast travel.
[56:22.24]Do I have to go to his tent to fast travel?
[56:28.92]I didn't even pay attention to how to do that because I didn't want to use it originally, so... Let's see, where am I going here?
[56:38.49]We're going to... Strawberry.
[56:41.49]It's behind this tent.
[56:50.97]Okay.
[56:52.60]Well, where the hell is Duchess?
[56:54.04]This is the new area we moved away, so...
[56:58.31]Is it behind my tent or is it behind Dutch's tent?
[57:08.21]Behind my tent.
[57:14.01]Hmm.
[57:21.16]On the side?
[57:22.00]It's the map on the side.
[57:26.72]Shaving kit.
[57:29.43]Clothing change.
[57:36.96]Fast travel, there it is.
[57:39.06]Well, apparently not anymore.
[57:41.38]There we go.
[57:42.72]Alright, strawberry.
[57:44.86]Does this cost money?
[57:53.22]No, it doesn't.
[57:53.90]Okay, that's cool.
[57:59.86]Goodbye.
[58:17.22]That just costed me some sweet Vista views.
[58:28.32]favorite member of dutch's gang uh Jose is cool fast travel more like you know what I'm saying
[58:57.98]Alright, Micah, let's go.
[59:02.38]Don't make me regret this.
[59:10.56]Every time you do a mission with Micah, you get a $300 bounty somewhere.
[59:14.56]That's why I've avoided it for so long.
[59:17.34]I don't want to go do a bunch of shit and get in a lot of trouble and have to pay somebody $300.
[59:37.91]It's like down here?
[59:44.83]Oh, there he is.
[59:47.87]Arthur, what the fuck was that?
[60:11.34]I need to refill.
[60:12.42]What do we need?
[60:15.96]One of these cubes.
[60:23.33]Have another one.
[60:28.39]Alright.
[60:32.26]See?
[60:32.74]Everything's fine.
[60:34.84]Alright, Micah.
[60:35.22]What do you want?
[60:35.88]What do you need?
[60:36.40]What do you want me to do?
[60:39.72]Let us begin.
[60:44.89]Why is Arthur apologizing to the horse for feeding it?
[60:49.40]I think he's apologizing for running the horse off the cliff and killing it.
[60:54.24]If I were to guess.
[61:04.18]A big shadow cast by a tiny tree.
[61:06.82]I don't even know what that means.
[61:09.04]I thought you was a tough boy.
[61:11.66]Not one of those gentlemen trying to protect his riding clothes.
[61:16.18]I just know whenever things get real, you turn yellow.
[61:19.49]Lose your head.
[61:20.23]Yellow?
[61:20.87]Sure seems that way.
[61:22.01]So I guess you won't be riding with me to rob the banking coach.
[61:27.83]I heard one of the old Driscoll boys yapping about it while I was inside.
[61:31.89]You and me?
[61:33.07]Do robbery?
[61:34.01]That's what I said, didn't I?
[61:35.85]Am I a tough boy?
[61:36.93]No.
[61:36.99]I'm a solid boy.
[61:41.54]Come on.
[61:42.60]I know an overlook where we can watch for them coming in.
[61:51.21]What are you doing anyway, camping out here?
[61:53.91]Robbing another bank.
[61:55.79]Can't exactly stay in town now, can I?
[61:59.03]Like I told you, I ain't going back to Dutch without a peace offering.
[62:03.78]Well, this is not a bank.
[62:05.00]What do you mean?
[62:07.36]Comes through about this time every day, like I said.
[62:10.38]If we were robbing a bank, we'd be really far away from it right now.
[62:14.70]Guns, riders.
[62:16.98]Nothing serious.
[62:18.60]You'll be fine.
[62:21.00]I heard the bank's been hiring every trigger man they can get of late.
[62:25.54]The meaner, the better.
[62:27.43]Compact and solid.
[62:28.17]Jerma is dense.
[62:28.85]Well, den- no.
[62:29.57]I'm not dense.
[62:29.91]It is a bank.
[62:30.17]So, we're gonna ride to a bank?
[62:31.27]No.
[62:54.81]I'm gonna play Just Cause 4 when it comes out.
[62:56.39]I never played Just Cause 3.
[62:57.35]No, did I?
[62:57.61]I think I played, maybe I did play Just Cause 3 for like a day on the multiplayer.
[63:16.45]Just Dance?
[63:16.85]No, you'll never see a Just Dance stream from me.
[63:21.73]The only way you'll ever get a Just Dance stream from me is if I hired like 30 dancers to dance behind me while we were all in the same costume.
[63:50.69]Do it.
[63:58.86]Maybe one day.
[64:03.62]Just do it now.
[64:04.46]I'll be right back.
[64:10.65]See you guys in like 15 minutes?
[64:13.19]Alright, this is the spot.
[64:15.57]Hold up on this ridge.
[64:18.31]Alright, here's the spot.
[64:19.67]Hold up on the bridge.
[64:20.51]You got it.
[64:20.93]Doesn't Micah look like he's wearing a rubber mask and over the rubber mask, fake hair.
[64:29.43]Fake mustache, fake beard, fake hair.
[64:48.48]Let's go.
[64:49.20]There's that music.
[64:52.24]Attack the guards and stop the stagecoach.
[64:57.97]This is a robbery!
[65:19.88]Bingo!
[65:25.24]Ooh, did I get them all?
[65:25.98]There's only one guy left, right?
[65:30.15]Don't need more.
[65:31.11]See you later.
[65:43.67]Oops-a-daisy.
[65:44.51]Got him!
[65:44.97]I shot him right in the tailbone.
[65:48.19]Are you playing Red Dead Online?
[65:49.72]No.
[65:49.84]You'll see it tomorrow.
[65:50.62]I feel like it's gonna be wild.
[65:51.50]Wait, I don't get to drive?
[66:14.52]I gotta keep the horses with us.
[66:15.78]Come on, horse, let's go!
[66:19.46]Hat in the wagon.
[66:20.42]Yeah, the hat's fine.
[66:33.83]What did I tell you?
[66:35.07]Like licking butter off a knife.
[66:37.59]Something like that.
[66:39.23]Maybe it'll fall off.
[66:39.87]We don't want to just break it open here and be done with it.
[66:43.46]Could be more than we can carry.
[66:46.08]And there might be a second crew of riders tailing.
[66:49.42]Take the hat.
[66:50.06]Take the hat.
[66:50.44]I'll get the hat in a little bit.
[66:51.24]Not to mention, we ride back in with a big take and a new wagon to boot.
[66:57.20]Judge can't say we ain't pulling our weight no more, can he?
[67:01.34]It's too tense, I can't stand it.
[67:03.82]What if the hat falls?
[67:04.52]It's gone.
[67:04.76]Gotta get that hat.
[67:32.88]No, the mission's gonna fail.
[67:33.78]The mission's gonna fail.
[67:36.11]I don't want to sit through that.
[67:36.87]I don't want to hear him talk.
[67:38.64]I hate this character.
[67:44.65]Forget about the hat.
[67:46.03]It's gone.
[67:46.61]Forever.
[67:46.95]That's so funny.
[67:48.55]Garbage stream.
[67:50.29]He lost the hat on purpose.
[68:11.86]How much did you pay for Red Dead?
[68:13.40]I did the wrong thing.
[68:16.02]I paid... I paid the middle-of-the-road special edition, which is... You just get a cool horse.
[68:24.40]You don't get to participate in the beta that happened today.
[68:26.92]Well, I will tomorrow.
[68:28.88]But... I bought the one that you shouldn't have bought.
[68:31.99]Oh.
[68:37.51]Where's the QTE?
[68:43.59]When is movie night?
[68:44.21]Movie night is Sunday.
[68:45.77]This weekend.
[68:49.78]Here we go, watch this.
[68:58.93]One, two, three, activate!
[69:06.25]Oh, I didn't have enough Deadeye.
[69:07.45]Oh my god, that's a mistake.
[69:08.91]I need Deadeye.
[69:10.57]Let's drink some time.
[69:32.02]No, that's the guy.
[69:39.86]Banjo-Kazooie music.
[69:43.30]Why is that making me laugh so much?
[70:00.75]through my other rifle.
[70:08.51]What is this?
[70:09.05]Did that happen?
[70:10.09]Oh, Sunday.
[70:10.62]It's Sunday.
[70:12.76]It's Sunday night.
[70:16.82]Did I not?
[70:17.28]Am I crazy or not?
[70:18.90]Maybe I didn't finish my sentence.
[70:24.42]Alright.
[70:24.76]Okay.
[70:25.32]Well, we got more.
[70:32.81]How many people are here?
[70:33.81]There's so many.
[70:35.38]I wonder if moving out is a date or not.
[70:38.96]I have no idea.
[70:51.99]And Dark Souls with a light gun.
[70:53.49]Day of the week is Sunday.
[70:54.35]It's the one that comes after Saturday and before Monday.
[70:58.22]Sunday PM.
[70:58.96]Yeah, Sunday Raspberry PM.
[71:00.16]Nice.
[71:22.71]Got it!
[71:25.29]Do online?
[71:25.78]I can't do online.
[71:26.42]I did not buy the Ultimate Edition.
[71:34.54]I have to wait till tomorrow, so I'm just kind of getting familiar with the video game again, so that I'm prepared tomorrow and I know what I'm doing.
[71:41.55]Fucking mask, rubber mask, with a goddamn fake mustache on it.
[71:46.35]I'll pull that off sooner or later, Micah.
[71:49.84]We'll see who you really are.
[72:04.79]600 bucks 300 that's pretty good 330 dollars alright there we go come on girl ultimate edition no the only ultimate edition I bought was zoo tycoon 2. alright well there you go hey there you go
[72:33.78]where I think I'm just gonna go like this and it was with the money too what do you mean the money I was trying to I'm trying to launch myself I'm trying to do a springboard shoot out of the cannon into the water move
[73:05.76]It's just not gonna happen, is it?
[73:09.53]If it was online, you'd get four dollars and four cents.
[73:15.71]You need to be going faster, though.
[73:20.68]Alright, so I'm good with...
[73:32.57]Did he just shoot me off?
[73:48.22]You have mere seconds to live.
[73:56.33]Whoa, crazy Red Dead 2 moments.
[74:05.65]Okay, so we got an auto-save here.
[74:07.41]So we're good.
[74:09.24]Let's go do Adam Sandler versus Adam Sandler in a backstage brawl.
[74:17.29]That's not what I'm doing, by the way.
[74:27.56]So many games tonight.
[74:28.38]Yeah, I'm just kind of dicking around.
[74:30.19]I was hoping I could play the online.
[74:32.25]That was the plan, and then I found out that I wasn't going to be able to play it, so... Just hanging out tonight.
[74:38.49]And we're going to be going tomorrow, too, so don't worry.
[74:43.26]I had fun tonight, though.
[74:45.48]Zoo Tycoon was really interesting for the first, like, you know, three or four hours.
[74:55.38]So let's get this changed.
[74:59.90]I don't need to even really change the title, I don't think.
[75:11.09]Wait, what?
[75:19.31]Wait a minute.
[75:35.71]What the fuck is happening?
[75:47.56]I have this on PC.
[75:53.26]That's why it's like that.
[75:59.26]Why do I have this on PS4?
[76:00.86]What happened?
[76:01.48]What?
[76:03.43]Oh, fuck.
[76:04.43]Okay, I know what happened.
[76:09.43]I bought the game twice.
[76:19.02]Like, from... Like, between... From probably a while ago.
[76:22.52]When did I buy this?
[76:24.74]How long... Am I crazy?
[76:32.17]That's why there was a random... That was gonna be Beanbag Sonic.
[76:37.17]From whenever the fuck I started it.
[76:42.38]I must have gone, oh wait, there's a PC version, fuck, isn't there?
[76:44.88]And I bought, yeah.
[76:46.96]Well, okay.
[76:53.94]Alright.
[76:56.11]I bought it twice.
[76:57.05]Well, let's open the real one, the one that has the fucking 40 characters on it.
[77:06.25]I can't believe I didn't, like...
[77:12.89]It did not deserve to be bought twice.
[77:14.59]I was just... My brain just did not comprehend what was just going on right there.
[77:25.52]Yeah, so like six... Yeah, like probably seven days ago.
[77:29.10]Eight days ago.
[77:31.18]I bought it on PS4 because I didn't think it was on PC.
[77:35.55]And then I realized it was on PC.
[77:37.85]I started making somebody.
[77:47.61]Yeah, I'll take off the delay thing.
[77:53.79]You don't remember eight days ago?
[77:55.23]Well, no, I do.
[77:56.35]I remember buying it, but I don't remember when I... I don't... Like, the timeline is not in my brain.
[78:01.18]Because I spent so much time in the PC one.
[78:02.64]This guy buys games and forgets.
[78:12.62]I forgot to, like, fucking... I don't think you can... You can't even refund a game on PS4, can you?
[78:18.38]If you download it digitally?
[78:19.40]Alright, let's open up the real one.
[78:31.07]Here it is.
[78:32.67]I was wondering why that was... I'm fucking stupid.
[78:38.67]Alright.
[78:42.53]Here it comes.
[78:47.37]And this one was like 50% off on Steam.
[78:53.54]That's the worst part.
[78:56.84]And I just hurt myself in my ears.
[79:15.91]I'm really sorry that happened, everybody.
[79:28.31]The outro's playing.
[79:30.71]Hey, look, that guy's dabbing!
[79:34.19]Okay.
[79:36.23]Let's go to play here.
[79:37.32]Here you go.
[79:39.42]Let's do, uh... Backstage Brawl is the match we're gonna do.
[79:59.08]Really, game?
[79:59.58]You can't... No duplicates!
[80:16.53]I have an idea.
[80:17.01]How about we do... Oh, that's right.
[80:21.56]I forgot we made him, too.
[80:22.64]Alright, let's do... Let's do the two actors.
[80:32.73]Willem Dafoe versus the Nintendo Labo.
[80:35.57]Sounds right to me.
[80:36.71]Let's do it.
[80:42.76]He's really good.
[80:43.42]He is.
[80:55.88]Not even gonna wait.
[80:57.00]Spun him around.
[80:58.12]Where's the punch?
[81:00.30]Talking shit in his face.
[81:04.74]At least it's even!
[81:08.06]The Labo is just a Minecraft character.
[81:13.18]Yeah, kick his ass, Dafoe!
[81:23.86]Why everybody ends it instantly?
[81:25.06]I would laugh my ass off.
[81:30.40]What happened to Red Dead?
[81:31.48]Um, uh, the stream is pretty much over.
[81:33.13]We're just doing this for fun.
[81:39.13]Dude, even me versus the Labo.
[81:44.54]Come on, bend him!
[81:45.50]Fold him!
[81:46.00]Is this how I treat my Labo creations?
[81:51.58]I mean, not completely, uh... Not completely untrue.
[81:59.78]Can't lift him.
[82:04.52]The stock sound effects really are so stupid.
[82:11.97]So how does this end?
[82:18.64]I'm thinking Labo is going to go through a table.
[82:22.70]Go into the locker room.
[82:23.80]Don't just fight out here next to the sound equipment.
[82:38.62]They just keep doing the throw him into the wall thing.
[82:43.47]There we go.
[82:44.07]Into the locker room.
[82:44.97]Make something happen here.
[82:59.18]Jesus!
[83:02.42]That could end really quickly.
[83:03.72]I love how that's just a big giant... He's gonna kill him.
[83:12.06]There's just a cartoon trash can in here.
[83:24.79]Get back in there.
[83:27.67]His head's too big.
[83:29.35]His head is too big.
[83:34.89]You just let him go.
[83:35.69]That's it?
[83:37.43]You just let him go.
[83:42.57]He picked him up and dropped him.
[83:57.71]That's gonna be it.
[83:59.85]That was fucking stupid.
[84:05.17]No, I don't want to... If I'm gonna do wrestling stuff, I want it to be...
[84:10.10]Something that I think about and well thought out, not just random matches.
[84:14.14]Maybe someday.
[84:17.28]Create Super Sailor.
[84:18.50]No, no, no, no, no.
[84:21.22]Not tonight.
[84:23.73]I might increase the frequency that we do stuff like this.
[84:29.95]But not so much where it happens all the time.
[84:38.41]But anyways, that's going to be it for tonight.
[84:42.67]Thank you for sticking around.
[84:43.47]A little bit of a just chill stream.
[84:47.20]We... We... Something in my throat.
[84:53.24]Played a couple of games.
[84:56.18]Thanks for joining me.
[84:58.10]And we'll do the bits, and we'll do the credits at the end.
[85:00.95]See you guys tomorrow for Red Dead Multiplayer.
[85:06.29]I'm not going to start as late as I did today.
[85:08.65]I will be starting at probably... An hour or two before.
[85:16.58]So somewhere around... Probably like 5 or 6 Eastern.
[85:23.62]I'd like to start...
[85:27.13]I'm not going to finish the main story in Red Dead tomorrow.
[85:29.75]I don't know.
[85:31.33]Maybe if multiplayer.
[85:32.81]Do multiplayer for a few hours.
[85:35.20]See how it goes.
[85:35.90]If I'm still having fun.
[85:36.76]Maybe I'll just transition and just keep going in Red Dead.
[85:38.70]I don't know.
[85:39.36]We'll see.
[85:42.40]Did you miss the green screen movie night?
[85:43.86]You did not.

[87:51.98]Thank you so much, Enamelant.
[87:58.17]Thank you for the $10.

[88:14.71]$10 three times in a row here, guys.
[88:15.67]Thank you.
[88:16.85]Hey, Jerma, it's my birthday today.
[88:17.92]Just like to say thank you for all the laughs.
[88:19.58]I've been incredibly depressed for the past while.
[88:21.72]Any videos and streams have helped cheer me up.
[88:23.56]There's a small token of my appreciation.
[88:25.38]Keep up the good work.
[88:26.96]You're really doing a lot of good.
[88:30.56]Well, happy birthday.
[88:32.14]Hopefully it's still your birthday, because that was a while ago.
[88:34.36]And if it's past your birthday, happy second birthday.
[88:39.47]Which is tomorrow.
[88:40.33]Which is today for you, potentially.
[88:42.27]Depending on where you are in the world.
[88:45.35]But thank you so much.
[88:46.21]Happy birthday.
[88:49.25]Sorry to hear about that you've been feeling bad.
[88:55.01]If you're having fun, that makes me happy.
[88:56.41]So, thank you.
[89:01.84]It's a double birthday.
[89:06.62]Thank you, Spartanis, again, for the $1.
[89:09.04]Spartanis, again.
[89:09.78]Spartanis gave $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $5 here.
[89:11.72]We're almost $6 here.
[89:15.72]No message, just dropping bits.
[89:18.72]Thank you.
[89:21.48]Dogmemes, thanks for the $10.
[89:24.46]Dogmemes.
[89:26.72]Hey, Jerma, memes aside, I've been watching you since the TF2 days.
[89:31.91]And six years later, and you're still going strong.
[89:35.03]Here's some money.
[89:35.71]Spend it on whatever you want.
[89:36.81]Thanks for being a cool guy.
[89:41.85]Thank you.
[89:43.75]Thank you for being nice enough to pay money to somebody on the internet.
[89:48.89]You know what I mean?
[89:53.39]All of you.
[89:56.47]Six years ago.
[89:59.04]That's so long.
[90:01.55]Can you imagine, like, fast forward, like, a few years?
[90:05.51]Like, oh, yeah, I've been watching you for 10 years.
[90:07.28]Oh, 10 years ago when I started.
[90:10.90]Who knows?
[90:16.08]I can't even fathom saying those words.
[90:21.45]Because right now it's about six and a half to seven, yeah?
[90:25.75]Another few years and it's gonna be a decade.
[90:31.38]That's crazy.
[90:35.59]At that point, that's a significant portion of my entire life.
[90:39.83]Will have been doing this.
[90:42.65]On YouTube, on Twitch, or wherever and whatever I end up doing.
[90:48.01]We'll see.
[90:48.41]I don't give myself a time limit, but I don't give myself an amount of time that I have to do it.
[90:56.27]It's not like, oh, yeah, well, you know, in 20 years when I'm still streaming on Jerma985 Twitch.
[91:02.38]I don't know.
[91:05.22]It's very significant already, though.
[91:06.40]That's true.
[91:12.42]But thank you, Dom.
[91:14.00]Dog memes.
[91:15.87]Appreciate it.
[91:17.99]Gentle Ghosts, thanks for the $5.
[91:19.29]Hey, Jerma, my friend Warren, who is also a big fan of yours, is turning 18 this week.
[91:26.07]I was wondering if you could wish him a happy birthday.
[91:28.06]You've been watching your content with me for the past few years, and I'm sure it'll mean a lot to him.
[91:31.62]Thanks.
[91:33.10]Yeah?
[91:34.04]Happy birthday, Warren.
[91:38.01]18?
[91:39.15]Significant milestone?
[91:43.51]That's the... You're an adult?
[91:47.38]Except I didn't really become an adult until I was probably like 26.
[91:52.04]So.
[91:58.78]Singing the rat song.
[92:01.70]A lot of birthdays, huh?
[92:03.50]This week?
[92:04.40]Today?
[92:04.90]Tomorrow?
[92:12.82]Thank you, Gentle Ghosts.
[92:13.88]And again, happy birthday to Warren.
[92:16.06]Thanks for watching.
[92:23.94]You guys rock.
[92:24.46]Thank you.
[92:24.94]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[92:26.16]I was rewatching you play Mario Tennis and you mentioned a music stream.
[92:29.76]Has that been canceled?
[92:31.78]Looking forward to the green screen movie night.
[92:33.24]I'm currently working on a submission.
[92:34.40]Hopefully it'll be done in time.
[92:35.56]Take care.
[92:38.40]Um... I haven't like... I don't cancel ideas.
[92:46.08]It took a long time.
[92:46.82]Think about this, right?
[92:48.40]The detective stream.
[92:51.06]The green screen stream.
[92:54.09]Think of how long it took to actually get that done.
[92:58.01]So, it's not like it ever goes away completely.
[93:02.75]That green screen stream was mentioned more than three or four months ago.
[93:10.95]And then, you know, when they happen, they happen.
[93:15.48]Kind of have to be in the right mindset.
[93:17.10]Time has to be right.
[93:17.84]I have to get the right resources ready.
[93:21.96]And try to get it done, you know?
[93:26.82]The detective stream was also, that took a while to do as well.
[93:31.73]God, I want to do that again, but like more elaborate.
[93:36.75]I have no idea.
[93:37.33]I got to think of some stupid ideas for that one.
[93:40.38]But thank you, Dr. Clay.
[93:42.18]No, nothing has ever, ever canceled.
[93:46.60]They just get moved around.
[93:49.52]Hey, Div USP.
[93:52.23]I'm just kidding.
[93:54.35]Thank you Divis for the three dollars.
[93:56.25]Divis P for the three bucks.

[94:18.90]And I've been a fan ever since.
[94:21.62]Also, can you do the Neelix voice, please?
[94:25.44]Why?
[94:25.76]I just can't believe... I'm dressing up as Neelix for Halloween next year.
[94:33.67]And everyone's gonna hate my guts.

[95:16.44]Don't get into that shit.
[95:18.64]Don't do that shit.
[95:26.18]What?

[96:20.08]Did you hear what he said?
[96:20.99]What the fuck?
[96:21.95]He's definitely high.

[96:52.97]Yes, they do.

[98:04.36]Appreciate it.
[98:06.88]Uh, Dorosophilia, thanks for the one dollar.
[98:09.34]Hey man, I couldn't find the donate button.
[98:11.46]This streamer doesn't have any on-screen text or information in the stream title telling me how to donate, so I didn't know what else to do.
[98:17.60]Pretty unprofessional if you ask me.
[98:19.14]Would you kindly pass along my money to him?
[98:21.36]Yeah, sure.
[98:22.50]Oh, that's from what it was, okay.

[101:12.37]Extra Cheesy, thanks for the $1.
[101:14.76]Why are the beavers living in raw sewage?
[101:17.04]No, that was a habitat that was created with craft and care.
[101:20.56]And I made sure to make it as comfortable as I could.
[101:26.56]They had a good life.
[101:30.16]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the one dollar.

[102:01.00]It's all good, man.
[102:04.36]Yeah, I've seen a couple pieces of art for the Rumble a couple nights ago.
[102:10.52]It's great.
[102:11.02]I love it.
[102:12.77]Thank you.
[102:14.80]Extra cheesy, thanks for the $1.
[102:16.26]Beaver... No, there was... The beaver habitat was a well-taken-care-of, established zoologist.
[102:30.21]There were... Auto-emote incoming.
[102:37.74]The beavers were taken care of just fine.
[102:40.20]And there was no issues, there were no problems.
[102:45.03]Appreciate the a dollar.
[102:46.39]Appreciate the a dollar, though.
[102:48.87]That was really, really worded.
[102:52.67]But thanks.
[102:54.39]Uh, Dr. Frohman, thanks for the one dollar.
[102:57.29]Thanks for being an awesome streamer.
[102:58.27]Looking forward to the movie night.
[102:59.46]Me too.
[103:01.76]It's coming up really quick.
[103:02.86]Again, I gotta reiterate this.
[103:04.36]Make sure that if you have a submission, you get it in by Thursday at midnight.
[103:08.04]That is not even, that's two days from now.
[103:12.56]Thursday at midnight.
[103:14.46]And then make sure it is a YouTube link.
[103:19.00]Check the rules in the pinned message there and follow them all.
[103:23.32]Because if you do not follow those rules, then your submission is not going to be put in or considered.
[103:29.92]Please follow the rules.
[103:35.21]Thank you.
[103:37.20]Uh, uh, Asian Turtle, thanks for the one dollar.
[103:39.10]I made this while I was waiting for the stream to start and while you spent the next hour building an enclosure for your beavers.
[103:49.37]From the... Oh, man.
[103:59.62]We bought a zoo.
[104:01.94]Thank you for the one dollar.
[104:08.62]Major Bluetooth, thanks for the $5.
[104:11.81]Hey Jerma, really enjoyed the latest installment into the Rumble canon and wanted to leave a cheer in its honor for all the great laughs.
[104:17.67]Since the Rumble did not have a US president, I took your advice and imagined the green screen to be William H. Taft, our 27th.
[104:25.97]What a treat it was for our first US president to get our first US president victory after such an epic struggle and then watch him honor his own legacy by getting stuck on the rope.
[104:38.21]Also juicy.
[104:43.31]Thank you, MajorBluetooth, for the $5 for that juicy $5.
[104:46.57]Juicy fruit.
[104:56.47]But yeah, it could have been anybody.
[104:58.38]That's why he's too powerful.
[105:01.30]He will never return.
[105:02.90]Until I do a champion's brawl.
[105:07.26]But you could probably imagine what that would mean.
[105:10.54]SwiggityDank, thanks for the $20, SwiggityDank.
[105:15.75]Hey, Jerma just got out of the hospital from getting surgery on my nuts.
[105:22.77]It doesn't feel too great as you can imagine, but I'm alright.
[105:25.47]And this stream is helping me keep my mind off of it.
[105:27.43]Thanks, man.
[105:33.20]Sorry to hear that, dude.
[105:34.48]Hope you're okay.
[105:38.02]Thanks for the $20.
[105:43.53]Hopefully you recover quickly, and hopefully it's nothing serious.
[105:48.49]Take care of yourself.
[105:53.10]Thanks for the $20.
[105:55.48]Hey, Dragon Breath, thanks for the $1.
[105:56.60]Hey, Jerma, in case you haven't seen, Joel addressed that thing about the dog smell question that happened during the Labo stream.
[106:04.78]You should listen to this with chat for a few minutes.
[106:06.96]This is a VOD link.
[106:12.66]Dog smell.
[106:15.84]By the way, that's a weird kind of anecdote here.
[106:22.25]Now, I don't know if this is the right place to talk about this.
[106:28.06]uh but I know that jerma hosted me or that he didn't host me he was doing like a little joke on stream and I want to say I was I was being a bit of an asshole a no fun asshole because like wait what no he wasn't was he I don't remember that no that didn't
[106:49.55]Here's the deal, what happened last Gregory Horror Show stream.
[106:53.98]Jeremiah was going around, and I don't fully get the brunt of this joke, right?
[106:58.98]But he was going around, and he was having a little bit of fun, right?
[107:03.89]And he was having fun with all these streamers, right?
[107:09.15]And then somebody suggested he should, like, do the thing for me.
[107:13.21]And it was, like, some sort of, like, weird raid question about dogs or something like that.
[107:19.65]And he did it to several people.
[107:21.43]But when it came to me, I was... What the fuck?
[107:42.63]having like technical issues at the same time and I was like getting back and forth support from chat or something like that I can't fully remember what happened but uh and in the midst of this a bunch of like Jerma viewers bled onto my stream and started asking questions and I kind of was like a bit of an asshole about I started saying like hey I really appreciate you guys like beaming but like I'm trying to figure shit out here
[108:05.21]And Jerma felt so fucking bad.
[108:07.84]I did.
[108:08.24]I really did.
[108:08.80]He apologized for a good solid hour.
[108:10.70]Basically saying, hey guys, be chill.
[108:16.52]I really did feel so bad.
[108:17.86]I felt like a terrible dick for not playing along.
[108:21.70]Just to make sure here, I have no absolute, no bad fucking blood between Jerma and I. He's a super cool guy.
[108:30.45]And I gotta say this too, the fact that he apologized...
[108:34.17]and he was like guys just chill out that that shows respect and uh I'm fine with playing along with stuff like that but just the fact that he did apologize for it because there's a lot of people that like they don't give a shit what their audience does or this chat does and the fact that he stepped out of the way to like kind of not police his chat but you say you know calm down you know I appreciate that you know so uh you know
[108:57.35]call me call me Jerma you can get into all kinds of weird uh stinky role play if you want nah that's all good like that he's a good dude I wasn't under the impression that there was any problem at all I just wanted I just you know I mean because sometimes when people
[109:28.80]I was kind of losing my mind on stream, and we were going, like, he's right.
[109:32.10]We were bouncing around to different places, and... Critical started throwing cards at me.
[109:37.72]I ran into Etalyx' stream, and, you know, we were just having fun.
[109:42.06]And, uh, but if you feel like trying to get shit done... If you have something going on, and you're trying to figure out something, and all of a sudden it's like... You're kind of like, what the hell are you supposed to do at that point, right?
[109:56.93]But, no, there's...
[110:01.62]It's all good.
[110:03.95]He's a great dude.
[110:08.43]Drunk Lavostream, like, STRIKES AGAIN.
[110:22.37]You drank 400 glasses of wine.
[110:25.73]Ay yi yi.
[110:28.77]But anyways, uh, yeah.
[110:32.18]That's that.
[110:33.14]And... Oh, did I... Yeah.
[110:38.02]ExtraCheesy gave $13.
[110:38.82]To ask about my favorite animal.
[110:43.64]And I said I wanted a laptop or something.
[110:45.88]I don't remember.
[110:46.49]But thank you so much, ExtraCheesy, for the $13.
[110:49.95]Armadillo was the correct answer.
[110:53.69]But thank you.
[110:55.37]ExtraCheesy again came in with $3.

[111:08.69]Thank you Dr. Garbage and friends for the $1.
[111:10.75]Hey Jeremy, you should play the re-release Spyro and ruin my childhood.
[111:14.55]I don't want to ruin your childhood.
[111:18.51]What's wrong?
[111:18.97]Is the new Spyro not good?
[111:20.93]I thought it was good.
[111:25.41]But thank you.
[111:26.84]Thank you 9e for the $1.
[111:27.90]Name the restrooms after chat.

[111:38.91]Please say Zoo Wee Mama three times fast.
[111:47.81]I bet you can't.
[111:52.61]I'm not going to do that.
[111:58.11]Hold on.
[111:58.45]I'll mute my microphone for a second.
[112:09.64]I don't get it.
[112:10.02]I don't understand.
[112:27.17]This is a meme, don't worry.
[112:28.41]Okay, fine.
[112:29.89]We don't do memes here.
[112:31.69]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[112:33.97]Ho, ho, ho, it's almost that time of year again.

[112:39.41]I can't finish a movie for the stream, the movie stream, since I got finals soon, but the Jerma Cinematic Universe has not yet halted production.
[112:48.42]Odie, watch what you're doing.
[112:50.00]That boom mic cost a whole $30.
[112:51.46]What a crazy dog.
[112:53.58]I bet Otto doesn't do stuff like that.
[112:55.20]Don't drop that.
[112:56.18]You're fired.
[112:56.94]Congratulations on another awesome Jermania.
[112:59.09]You always put so much work.
[113:00.51]Did you just drop it, Odie?
[113:09.33]Thank you for the one dollar, Garfield.
[113:11.85]Appreciate it, Barfield.

[113:42.50]Quantum death.
[113:46.34]Thank you, Garfield, for the one dollar.
[113:51.89]Hey, Pilot Guy.
[113:52.86]Thank you, Pilot Guy, for the $20, Pilot Guy.
[113:54.52]Hey, Chairman, I just want to say thank you for all the laughs through my times of stress.

[114:17.87]It's a good thing you're streaming because I dread to live in a world where you actually rent an amusement park.
[114:24.55]Jerma land.
[114:27.21]It's a good thing it's just a stream.
[114:30.63]I think I would do a pretty good job.

[115:12.63]Uh, thank you, Bunnybutt, for the one, two, three, four, five dollars here.
[115:19.97]Bunnybutt.
[115:21.39]How does one go about making stupid camera jokes?
[115:24.42]I'm hoping for advice from my own streams.
[115:29.64]Stupid camera jokes.
[115:32.40]How many bits do I have to spend to name him Skateboard?
[115:38.38]Well, I didn't make him have any name.
[115:44.93]But stupid camera jokes.
[115:46.27]I don't... Get a camera.
[115:49.57]And do the default Fortnite dance in front of it.
[115:53.11]And then have a green screen behind you and key yourself into a genie bottle or something.
[116:03.01]And then when the person rubs you out...
[116:05.64]Of the- of the bottle, of the bottle, of the bottle, of the genie bottle.
[116:10.14]When you come out of the genie bottle, you can like give him like a hundred- nevermind, moving on.
[116:15.89]A hundred wee- uh, wee bucks.
[116:17.79]No, not wee, like Nintendo wee.
[116:20.47]Vee bucks.
[116:27.97]That threw me off so bad because of the stupid shit that I just said, but thank you, Bunnybutt.
[116:33.07]Uh, I'm sorry I didn't name him Skateboard.
[116:36.47]Severian the Great.
[116:37.73]Thanks for your $11, Severian.
[116:42.61]Thank you so much.
[116:43.39]No message.
[116:44.23]Just $11 fucking dollars.
[116:46.40]Thank you.
[116:48.88]Thank you so much.
[116:49.58]Hater the Tater for the $5.
[116:51.78]Actually, more like $11 here from Hater the Tater.
[116:58.85]Jar Jar but Fun Size is Jerjer.
[117:01.71]Jerjer.
[117:01.95]Jerjer.
[117:05.05]That gets an ee-hee from me.
[117:06.17]That gets an ee-hee from me.
[117:08.65]Also, stream is now middle-aged, rocky, and unstable, but still going like Jerma.
[117:12.77]You're not middle-aged until you're like 45 or 50 years old.
[117:15.05]I'm fine.
[117:15.49]I'm doing just good enough.
[117:17.89]Thank you for your $11.
[117:18.51]Appreciate it.
[117:20.91]That gets a little bit of an ee-hee from me.
[117:22.42]You know what I'm saying?
[117:24.74]Mostly lost.
[117:25.34]Thanks for the $2 here.
[117:27.30]I liked Just Cause 3 a lot.
[117:28.76]I think it would be a great game to play.
[117:32.36]Jerma game.
[117:35.34]Yeah, I... I mean, I'm gonna give it a try.
[117:41.21]Just Cause 4 comes out in... like, 6... EDF 5 comes out... in less than a week and a half.
[117:57.38]Oh, shit.
[118:03.55]Wow, I forgot about that.
[118:05.73]Earth Defense Force 5 comes out on PlayStation 4.
[118:09.53]December 10th?
[118:10.29]December 11th?
[118:13.55]Well, you bet your ass you know what we're doing on the 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[118:24.10]It's gonna be that.
[118:30.48]Uh, but thank you, again, Mostly Lost.
[118:32.22]And it's got the right balance of fun gameplay and mechanics with a laughably bad story.
[118:36.24]That's Just Cause 3.
[118:37.06]I remember, uh, Star made a video on Just Cause 3.
[118:45.73]It looked pretty ridiculous, so... Definitely kind of up my alley.
[118:53.09]Uh, Sputa, thanks for the $1.
[118:54.63]I'm sorry I can only go for small bits this time, but considering you get so many bit messages, I'm sure it gets difficult to remember them all.
[119:01.08]But do you ever think back to messages from long ago, whether as a pick-me-up or just in general?
[119:08.15]um stuff sticks with me it does it can be like you said it can be very difficult though trying to bring back the memories of donation messages or bit messages and I try my best to keep you know as many as I can fit up there but that's it gets hard
[119:33.84]It's just that I never want to be one of those people that's just like, thanks for the dollar, thanks for five bucks, bye, bye, thank you, thanks, bye, thanks for the money.
[119:41.08]But it is a challenge.
[119:43.91]Do you talk to yourself while playing games offline too?
[119:45.81]Yes.
[119:49.77]I do.
[119:54.85]Like the one where I made you cry.
[119:59.63]Yeah, I mean, you guys...
[120:04.66]It's... I don't just take it lightly, you know?
[120:08.26]Some of you guys have given a lot of fucking money.
[120:12.08]A lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of your free time.
[120:14.92]And there are lots of... Here's the thing, right?
[120:19.04]The reason why I want to care so much about this and take it as... Try as hard as I can on certain scenarios and try to come up with things to do is because there are so many other avenues for you to use your free time.
[120:33.69]thousands of people, hundreds of shows, thousands and thousands of avenues for entertainment.
[120:42.00]It means an absolute metric shitload that out of all the possible places, you're here.
[120:49.89]So I have to take it fucking seriously because that's a huge, huge, huge thing.
[121:07.03]And I'm going to do it for as long as I can.
[121:11.98]As long as I'm having fun.
[121:13.52]And can keep coming up with stuff I'd like to do.
[121:17.20]I don't want to get to that position where it's like... I'm just doing it just to do it because I'm going to, because that's what I do, and I'm just going to do it.
[121:27.03]No, I don't want to do that.
[121:30.63]Until 40, when I can't say swears anymore.
[121:32.71]That's, yeah.
[121:40.93]It's true!
[121:41.63]You can't!
[121:46.55]But, thank you.
[121:48.03]Thank you, Sputa.
[121:50.11]Thank you, Pancakes, for the $1.
[121:51.95]Just wanted to say, you smell like a shoe.
[121:53.43]I really appreciate all your content.
[121:54.61]Keep it up.
[121:55.19]Let me see.
[121:56.96]Now that's Dove Men Plus Care.
[122:01.80]The... fucking... Walmart brand.
[122:06.12]But thank you, pancakes.
[122:06.80]Thank you, twitchy pyro for the $1.
[122:08.44]Jerma, thanks for providing a good laugh while I try to figure out how to get out of this walk-in oven.
[122:13.33]I'll keep at it.
[122:14.91]Try banging on the door and saying, hey!
[122:17.75]Somebody will go, what the fuck?
[122:18.76]And open it, probably.
[122:21.99]Thank you.
[122:23.32]Thank you, DubskiDude, for the $1.
[122:24.34]Hey, Jerma, I've been a fan of your content since kindergarten.
[122:27.14]How time flies.
[122:28.64]I'm already a great-grandfather and on my deathbed.
[122:31.82]I remember the smoke signal streams you used to do with the pilgrims.
[122:35.16]Good times, man.
[122:35.98]And let's not forget how you goofed on the Mesopotamians.
[122:39.34]Their civilization wasn't the same after that one.
[122:42.42]Can't wait for another 6.7 million years of quality streams.
[122:46.72]Keep it up, you timeless streamer boy.
[123:09.81]Thank you, DovskyDude.
[123:12.37]Thank you for the one dollar.
[123:14.55]And we're going for another seven million years.
[123:17.33]They're gonna figure it out.
[123:18.26]They'll figure out, like, robotics and I'll be able to put, like, an implant in my chest.
[123:29.61]Uh, thank you SpicyMexicanTaco for the one dollar.
[123:33.95]Thank you.
[123:35.33]Dollar five.
[123:37.00]Dr. Clay for the $1.
[123:37.96]Just want to say I hate the menu in WWE 2K19.
[123:42.83]It's just white background with gray text that says the menu selection.
[123:46.27]The UI literally looks like a placeholder.
[123:52.21]I know.
[123:53.34]Oh, yeah, I know.
[123:55.76]All the menus in these WWE games lately are just awful.
[124:05.47]Even the character creator.
[124:06.93]There's a menu for a menu inside of a menu to get to... Okay, you want to change somebody's hair.
[124:12.43]Click on... Okay, you got to go to body.
[124:15.93]Appearance.
[124:17.25]Facial appearances.
[124:18.45]And then the hair.
[124:19.21]There's like four menus.
[124:22.75]There's so many menus that just stacked on top of each other.
[124:30.28]I would really much rather... And I don't know why they don't do this.
[124:33.88]I don't understand...
[124:35.93]Wrestling is not like baseball, or football, or... Don't worry.
[124:44.37]Like, Sheamus is still gonna exist in 2020, you know what I mean?
[124:50.90]They're turning it into this roster update where they add a handful of features.
[124:56.34]It's not like, oh, every single year, hundreds and hundreds of people change teams.
[125:04.23]And you could argue that that could just be done with something as simple as a patch, right?
[125:16.02]Wrestling isn't real, so... Well, I mean, there's the aspect of, like, the fantasy kind of fiction aspect to it, yeah.
[125:24.25]But... I don't know why they have to come up with one every single year.
[125:31.83]It doesn't need to happen.
[125:33.97]That didn't happen before.
[125:36.33]That's a fairly recent thing.
[125:38.03]The last probably 10 years.
[125:41.15]A wrestling game would come out when a wrestling game decided it was going to come out.
[125:47.92]And turning the WWE franchise into a Madden-like simulation sports game that has to come out on a yearly schedule...
[125:58.05]is in my opinion is killing the whole thing it's killing the whole franchise and I would not be somebody that's that my opinion that's not an unpopular opinion all of these games over the last five six or seven years
[126:16.41]It's at least Elastic Six.
[126:17.63]They've all, with the exception of maybe one or two of them, have been pretty, I would say, very mediocre ratings and reviews.
[126:26.10]Just like, eh, it's not special.
[126:28.12]It's just bad, and it's not very good.
[126:38.30]It's, I don't understand.
[126:46.44]After 2006 is when they started doing it every year, but those early ones were still good.
[126:51.46]So you don't know what happened.
[126:52.28]Well, what happened is THQ was liquidated and 2K ended up taking on the franchise.
[126:58.91]And they turned it into the NBA, you know, NBA 2K, WWE 2K.
[127:07.73]And, you know, they had the teams at 2K that do sports start to contribute to the games that, you know, they took on the license from the WWE.
[127:21.91]That's kind of what happened.
[127:26.99]Like, for real.
[127:28.88]THQ may be... One of the... People talked about it for a little while, but you don't even realize just how... That's like a pretty devastating loss to gaming.
[127:43.23]There were some really great fucking titles that were underneath THQ.
[127:56.00]If you think about, oh yeah, THQ got, like, wiped out and liquidated and gone.
[128:01.35]Oh, wow, that sucks.
[128:02.23]Oh, that's too bad.
[128:03.13]But then you realize, like, the rippling effects that that has.
[128:14.66]They made some pretty great games.
[128:16.36]Or at least they had enough to do with them.
[128:24.97]But I could sit here and be sad about... And I don't know, maybe I am one of those people that's speaking from a small audience.
[128:36.33]You know what I mean?
[128:38.17]Because I don't know.
[128:39.19]The reasons why I like the WWE games is because I like to make stuff.
[128:43.38]I like to make scenarios and... Oh, I... Remember in WWE 2K14, you could actually put your characters into like cutscenes?
[128:53.72]That shit was fucking awesome.
[128:55.68]There was like 40 or 50 different scenarios you could put the characters in to play out on screen.
[129:04.57]Just to use that game, I can't.
[129:07.45]Because it just does not hold up well at all.
[129:11.26]That game is only for PlayStation 3, and it takes like 15 seconds sometimes.
[129:20.69]20, 30 seconds.
[129:22.47]Once you have an elaborate character design, it can take... It's just so long, it's so slow, the menus are slow, the creation is so slow, it's just very outdated.
[129:44.85]So it would take, essentially, probably two or three times the amount of time to make a character than use the current gen version.
[130:00.26]And maybe it would be worth it, but I don't know, I just wish that they would... I mean, who knows?
[130:08.34]I don't know what the data is, what they have, or what people want out of a wrestling game, but
[130:15.19]I like the- the crazy league aspect of it.
[130:17.73]Where people get to make their own leagues and make their own interesting storylines and... That- That's what I did when I was 14, 15, 16.
[130:27.82]We would make entire scenar- We would make entire- Me and my friends would just sit there and just make whole scenarios.
[130:32.98]Make whole leagues.
[130:37.98]We used to make our dads, and our dads would fight each other in the ring.
[130:42.66]And it was like all storylines attached to each other's dads.
[130:53.87]That's what I want.
[131:03.61]I could care less if... Well, you know... The... Hulk Hogan's in this one.
[131:13.54]That's cool.
[131:14.02]Okay.
[131:14.64]I can make Hulk Hogan.
[131:16.82]I can just make him.
[131:21.38]But I'll get off that rant.
[131:27.42]Dad voice.
[131:30.71]But, anyways.
[131:31.85]Let's wrap it up here.
[131:33.93]MandragoreRoot.
[131:35.49]Thanks for the $1.
[131:37.57]MaisyKit, thanks for the $1.
[131:41.49]Is the new home treating you well?
[131:43.43]Yeah.
[131:44.93]I'd say it's settling in pretty nicely.
[131:50.20]Las Vegas is an awesome place.
[131:52.84]There's tons to do, tons to see.
[131:54.24]So yeah, I'm loving it.
[131:58.04]For sure.
[132:00.84]Thank you, Burger B, for the $5.
[132:04.75]Me and a few of the Discord boys have been trying to find the most effective way to thaw bread.
[132:08.37]What are your thoughts?
[132:09.61]Keep it real.
[132:12.41]How to thaw bread.
[132:16.31]Uh, how frozen is it?
[132:19.56]Is it, like, rock solid, or is it just slightly crystal-y on the inside?
[132:29.88]It's like an ice cube.
[132:31.22]Um... Well, you could... I mean, you could just sit on it for a little while.
[132:42.77]Just take it out.
[132:44.51]Just sit on it like a penguin.
[132:51.81]But make sure you have, like, jeans on.
[132:53.95]So it doesn't, like, get too cold.
[132:59.31]Our best thought was to light it on fire in a toilet.
[133:01.33]Now that is a terrible idea.
[133:04.27]No, put it in the microwave on thaw.
[133:06.25]Every microwave has a thaw setting.
[133:08.47]You just have to f- look at the manual, look at the instructional manual of your microwave and it'll- there'll be a thaw setting.
[133:14.57]Thaw it, maybe a minute or two, check it.
[133:17.17]Is it spongy?
[133:17.89]No, put it back in there, the thaw setting.
[133:21.83]Why would you sit naked on bread?
[133:23.97]I didn't say that, that's why I said wear a pair of jeans.
[133:31.74]Microwaving bread sounds like the saddest thing in the world.
[133:43.93]There's no reason to do that.
[133:45.45]If you get a piece of bread, oh, I'm gonna make like a sandwich.
[133:49.29]Just stick it in there and just, what, for 30 seconds?
[133:51.31]That'd be awful.
[133:58.96]It would turn into shit.
[134:00.80]It would be so sloppy.
[134:02.60]It would just pull apart.
[134:08.62]Set it to defrost, yeah.
[134:17.28]Am I gonna play Kingdom Hearts 3 when it comes out?
[134:20.52]I don't know if... I don't know.
[134:23.60]Probably not on stream.
[134:26.60]I don't think so.
[134:27.43]I feel like there's really only one way... Here's how I decide if it's something I want to stream.
[134:35.27]When there's really only one way to complete and play through a game, I'm not that interested in streaming it.
[134:44.01]And I say that for one reason, because...
[134:47.35]I don't know if you watch a Kingdom Hearts stream that's, you know, pointed every direction.
[134:51.59]If you're, oh, I'm in the Kingdom Hearts 3 directory.
[134:54.29]Okay.
[134:55.43]All of us here are doing the same thing.
[134:58.68]We're seeing the same cutscenes.
[135:00.28]We're seeing the same story.
[135:02.00]And I got the same Keyblade.
[135:04.48]There's not very much difference between them.
[135:10.76]You want me to reenact Kingdom Hearts on stream?
[135:15.86]I can't do that either.
[135:16.52]I don't know the script.
[135:21.49]That's how I determine if it's something I want to stream.
[135:26.19]How different is my experience going to be from the person that's potentially right next to me?
[135:33.14]Is there enough there that makes it fun enough?
[135:36.02]Different enough?
[135:41.64]I'm sure it's going to be a great game.
[135:54.89]But with that, thank you Elizabeth for the $1, Jerma Defoe.
[135:59.44]And here come the credits.
[136:01.16]Thank you for joining me on this just hangout, relaxed, chill stream.
[136:07.74]I had a good time.
[136:08.75]You know, I was like really chill tonight.
[136:11.37]Don't you think so?
[136:18.98]Were you guys relaxed?
[136:22.59]Making like dinosaurs and shit walking around.
[136:24.76]Yeah.
[136:28.76]Yeah.
[136:31.48]Check out Zoo Tycoon 1.
[136:32.50]Actually, that's what I'm going to do when the stream turns off.
[136:41.29]But thank you to all the subs.
[136:43.87]Everyone that just came in.
[136:47.19]New subs.
[136:48.33]Old subs.
[136:50.53]There are a lot of you now.
[136:54.53]There are a lot of subs.
[137:01.72]Chat keeps trying to make you cry, but maybe you should make Chat cry.
[137:05.20]No, why would I want to do that?
[137:06.82]I don't want to do that.
[137:12.67]Possibility of a game show week?
[137:18.85]Let's see what I haven't played.
[137:27.52]You broke your nail.
[137:29.28]That's not good.
[137:34.17]Grump broke a nail.
[137:36.89]Which one?
[137:40.23]Jeremy may cry.
[137:44.22]Uh, goodnight pale.
[137:46.26]I'll sub when I can.
[137:46.98]I've been a ghost viewer for a while until I finally made my account today.
[137:50.48]So good to interact with chat.
[137:51.96]Well, welcome to chat.
[137:59.71]And there's another one that just came in.
[138:00.85]14 months there.
[138:07.36]A hand nail.
[138:10.16]With one of them on the hands.
[138:14.40]Yeah, you gotta go to the nail blacksmith.
[138:18.74]You put your finger out and he just takes a hammer and he's just... Welcome to my Twitch chat room.
[138:32.87]So, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[138:36.01]Red Dead Online.
[138:37.95]Let's see if it's any good.
[138:39.82]Otherwise, we're going to transition to, like, me fucking reading cereal boxes.
[138:59.26]Play Jackbox with us?
[139:01.00]Oh yeah, that's true.
[139:02.50]Alright, here's the thing.
[139:03.20]If Red Dead Online is just like, oh, okay, I'm like riding around and running into trees, and a random guy threw a grenade at me, and it's that for like three hours or something, we'll play Jackbox tomorrow.
[139:13.89]That would be fun.
[139:16.33]Yeah, why the fuck not?
[139:17.03]Let's do it.
[139:19.17]Or, if Red Dead is good, then hold on to that, we'll probably do that on Friday.
[139:24.05]Yeah, fuck yeah, let's do that.
[139:25.77]Let's do that like in the next couple of days.
[139:34.75]Oh, fuck yeah.
[139:35.75]Yeah, fuck yeah.
[139:44.15]Alright, guys.
[139:45.55]Take care.
[139:45.89]See you tomorrow.
[139:48.25]Get some sleep.
[139:50.01]Talk to you soon.
[139:52.44]Ta-ta for now.
