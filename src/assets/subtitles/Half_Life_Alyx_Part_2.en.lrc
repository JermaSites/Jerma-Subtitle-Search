[00:01.30]Hi.
[00:03.56]Hi.
[00:05.78]Oh, hi!
[00:09.04]Oh, I got- I got wicked bunched up underwear.
[00:14.30]Is it weird that I wanted to go get bicycle shorts for these VR streams?
[00:22.37]Just wear them.
[00:24.31]Not- no, no, not just but- I'm talking underneath my pants.
[00:30.54]Is that not weird?
[00:31.22]Okay, good.
[00:34.62]Alright, for a second I thought this pair of underwear had pockets.
[00:38.36]And I'm sitting here thinking, wait a minute.
[00:39.66]Holy shit, what a brilliant idea.
[00:44.23]Imagine underwear with pockets.
[00:48.25]That would be sick.
[00:51.91]You'd never have to wear a pair of pants in your house ever again.
[00:57.03]You just put on underwear and have like, you know, there's the right pocket's got your chapstick in it, your left got your keys in your left pocket.
[01:04.85]I think there's something there.
[01:05.73]Why would you want?
[01:10.40]Why would you want?
[01:11.18]What?
[01:14.08]What about your hair?
[01:16.88]You just take your pants off to access them.
[01:19.04]No, you don't.
[01:20.38]You just reach down in there and like go in your underwear pocket and pull it out.
[01:24.25]It's like a secret chapstick.
[01:28.23]How's the hair?
[01:28.63]You'll see it in just about two seconds.
[01:31.65]You tell me.
[01:39.39]Looks okay, right?
[01:40.23]It looks alright.
[01:41.69]Doesn't it?
[01:49.01]you know what I did I'll tell you this camera's not a good place it's hard for me to show you uh hey by the way if you didn't know Twitch partner I have so many of these and I there's no other time to wear them this t-shirt I think has been in a closet since the last time it was on there on video
[02:16.16]I have... Don't tell him what.
[02:19.31]No, it's not the same shirt, because this one says Jerma985 on it.
[02:25.99]And it's number 17.
[02:27.11]You know, I picked 17, because that was the age when I knew I wanted to be a Twitch streamer.
[02:34.82]Yeah, that's where it all started.
[02:36.12]Except...
[02:42.16]Every person with this jersey has the number 17 on it.
[02:46.44]Every single one of these made.
[02:47.64]That was way too much work.
[02:54.55]They're all 17.
[02:58.03]Anyways, give me one second.
[03:00.35]I want to grab a water.
[03:01.61]We'll get started.
[03:02.23]No, no, no.
[03:03.81]Why am I doing this?
[03:04.80]Back to the intro.
[03:05.38]Back to the intro.
[03:06.76]Okay, let me grab a water and we'll get started.
[03:08.98]Just what?
[03:09.40]It's VR, man.
[03:10.90]You know how fucking hard it is to VR?
[03:12.98]Why did somebody just say cringe?
[03:14.17]Don't call me a cringe.
[03:15.13]I'll be right back.
[03:16.09]I was gonna get a water.
[03:17.49]You want me to die?
[03:56.44]We hadn't even started.
[03:57.42]Oh, I forgot to even tell you.
[04:04.68]No, it's not a late stream.
[04:05.62]We were supposed to start at 2.
[04:07.32]The sauce was wrong.
[04:11.81]Okay.
[04:12.77]So.
[04:18.21]My hands look like a bony.
[04:21.81]Why do I feel like I have these big bony hands?
[04:27.32]Anyways, so here's what I did to my hair, for all you wondering.
[04:31.88]This is quarter cup of olive oil.
[04:35.85]You know, okay, I... I have to go down here.
[04:39.93]I have no chair.
[04:41.07]Standing and leaning down like that is killing me.
[04:44.17]It's a quarter cup of olive oil and like eight drops of tea tree oil.
[04:49.53]And you just go like this with your finger and then you...
[04:56.51]Don't do that, by the way.
[04:58.45]And then you put it in your hair.
[04:59.69]You get it in there.
[05:00.41]You get it in the problem areas.
[05:03.90]My hair feels so good right now.
[05:05.50]I can't wait to do that later.

[05:08.16]Don't forget the link.

[07:24.24]None of you are my family.
[07:28.40]Not one of you.
[07:31.61]Am I really getting upside down colon D faces?
[07:36.53]None of you are my family.
[07:39.21]I'm not related to anybody in this chat.
[07:40.89]Maybe my mother.
[07:41.47]Isn't that what that means?
[07:48.63]I don't think I'm related to anybody here.
[07:55.20]That's what I like to see in the mirror.
[07:57.70]But anyways, alright, let's go.
[07:58.60]We're gonna play Half- Alyx.
[08:00.02]We're gonna continue.
[08:01.68]My hair's gonna be bad.
[08:02.56]It's gonna be awful, but it's okay.
[08:04.03]I've got my tea tree olive oil treatment in the bathtub waiting for me in about five hours.
[08:07.89]Is this right here?
[08:17.46]Yes.
[08:19.55]Five hour stream?
[08:20.43]I don't know.
[08:21.27]You missed the link.
[08:24.17]No, I didn't.
[08:25.62]That was the link.
[08:31.72]Alright, you gotta get your links out of the way now.
[08:36.46]Because there ain't no chance in hell I'm stopping to do this.
[08:48.17]That's shaving cream.
[08:52.22]Okay, weed, top left, coke, ecstasy, shrooms, alcohol, meth, PCP, and Xanax.
[09:05.79]I don't... Alright, the weed one is kind of funny.
[09:11.27]I don't understand the PCP one.
[09:15.70]I don't...
[09:17.25]Why am I so red?
[09:18.97]Why did you make me wicked red?
[09:22.39]Do you get wicked red when you get on PCP?
[09:25.46]I don't know.
[09:25.82]I've never done it before.
[09:26.66]I don't do any of these drugs.
[09:31.38]But hold on a second.
[09:34.62]Is that actually true?
[09:40.18]I don't do that, though.
[09:41.28]I don't.
[09:41.66]Alright.
[09:41.90]We're going to move on.
[09:52.67]Alright, let's go.
[09:53.97]You drink so much.
[09:55.87]The last time I drank alcohol was like six months ago.
[09:58.59]What do you mean I drink so much?
[10:07.07]Oh, by the way, I put the new... Yes, stalling, stalling.
[10:09.88]Yes, I am.
[10:10.48]I am stalling.
[10:11.96]I put a new face mask on here.
[10:14.94]This is new.
[10:16.44]This is a new face mask.
[10:17.84]This is not the old one.
[10:20.56]The other one was the wide peepoHappy, and this one is the narrow peepoHappy.
[10:29.02]This is for the narrow face.
[10:36.46]Hopefully this doesn't hurt.
[10:37.40]No more coal miner?
[10:39.84]I don't know.
[10:41.18]This is new.
[10:42.31]I might get the coal ring.
[10:46.31]Enable peepoHappy.
[10:47.45]You say it.
[10:48.19]I just said it.
[10:50.56]Just because I say it doesn't mean I have to enable it.
[10:53.78]This is actually really comfortable.
[10:54.97]Alright, let me... Hold on.
[10:56.11]Give me a minute.
[11:00.43]Why wouldn't there be, like, a hair place for your hair to go?
[11:04.37]You know what I mean?
[11:06.41]Why not just have, like, a big hole here that this hair can slide through?
[11:08.80]I mean, I would look like fucking Abe from Abe's Odyssey, but do I care?
[11:13.18]My hair won't get all damaged.
[11:16.20]Can you guys hear this?
[11:21.02]Now you can hear this.
[11:23.27]Just shave your head.
[11:23.99]I'm not shaving my head.
[11:25.09]I like my hair.
[11:26.35]My hair's fine.
[11:27.09]I can't gauge how somebody's hair looks after a VR helmet.
[11:33.91]That's not fair.
[11:34.96]Although sometimes I think about being bald and I'm like, damn.
[11:39.44]Like, it must be so easy just to not have to worry about it.
[11:41.72]Do you even wash your head?
[11:42.80]Okay, bald guys in the chat.
[11:46.39]Do you use shampoo on your bald head or do you use body wash?
[11:52.28]Which one?
[11:57.47]You do.
[11:59.95]Use both.
[12:00.71]Oh, well, okay.
[12:06.35]Left ear.
[12:06.71]Alright, I'm going in.
[12:08.57]I'm going in, Mr. Ant Stomach.
[12:12.08]Alright, so I got a shotgun, I got a pistol, I got some resin.
[12:17.26]Oh yeah, I just got the laser sight, didn't I?
[12:21.04]Alright, let's go.
[12:21.54]Half- Alyx Part 2.
[12:24.88]Getting really hyped up for this one.
[12:32.87]Alright, I'm in.
[12:34.11]I'm in and I'm immersed and I'm ready to experience the virtual world.
[12:38.45]It's hard to say words when you have ears and blocking ears.
[12:41.72]It's hard for me to talk when there's things in my ears because I can't hear myself talk so therefore I can't really talk that well.
[12:47.82]You guys get that, right?
[12:51.62]It's hard for me to talk unless I can hear myself.
[12:54.04]And I can't hear myself really at all, so that's why I'm talking louder.
[12:56.58]Yeah, it's hard for me to talk when I have ears.
[13:08.91]Alright, let's go.
[13:15.41]It's gonna be scary, it's gonna be fun.
[13:17.21]Oh, remember the piano?
[13:18.07]I forget, how do you move?
[13:19.31]Oh yeah, that's right.
[13:21.10]Oh shit, I forgot about this.
[13:22.12]I forgot this game's good!
[13:24.60]Oh, I forgot.
[13:27.12]I forgot we're playing a good game.
[13:29.96]I see it already.
[13:34.42]Didn't get it.
[13:43.84]Okay, I have a- I have a- I've got a little homework for you guys.
[13:48.99]Go find a channel, a stream, doesn't matter if it's a YouTuber, a streamer, a Twitter guy, find somebody that's played through this game and didn't come up here and do this.
[14:04.36]You find me a channel that ignored the piano, I don't think it's possible.
[14:11.61]Alright, let's go.
[14:13.85]Oh wait, you found somebody that actually ignored the piano.
[14:18.11]I'm getting resistance back here.
[14:19.38]What's going on?
[14:19.92]What's going on here?
[14:24.32]What is this?
[14:28.95]I'm putting on another person's skeleton every time I get into VR.
[14:31.63]Alright, let's go.
[14:47.85]I still got it.
[14:48.77]I still got it.
[14:49.29]I still got it.
[14:51.29]Let's try the other hand.
[14:51.97]Alright, let's go.
[14:56.96]Oh shit.
[14:59.86]How do I do the thing?
[15:01.08]It's been a week.
[15:09.59]Please only.
[15:14.14]Break our boxes.
[15:15.22]They can go.
[15:15.64]Oh, they move now.
[15:16.20]That's kind of annoying.
[15:37.49]He's on goal, the CBD's kicking it.
[15:39.75]I would never be high in this thing.
[15:43.74]Are you fucking kidding me?
[15:47.12]You gotta be shitting me, dude.
[15:48.16]High on VR.
[15:58.21]No, there's no way.
[16:03.15]What do I have?
[16:03.63]This is... I have a grenade.
[16:05.37]What do I do with this grenade?
[16:10.58]It didn't reset!
[16:19.64]Okay.
[16:20.10]It really wants me to take this.
[16:21.84]What does it want me to do with it?
[16:24.24]Reset in there.
[16:27.99]What was that?
[16:32.91]Game's a little quiet.
[16:36.91]Hold on.
[16:38.77]Fix that.
[16:39.25]Where are you?
[16:42.14]This game's a little bit quiet, I'll take care of it.
[16:47.97]Got you.
[16:50.23]Where's the mouse?
[16:51.69]Come on.
[16:52.97]Come on, where's the mouse?
[16:56.95]Got ya.
[16:57.25]Okay, what happened to my grenade?
[17:04.08]Alright, I need that thing.
[17:08.22]The power supply.
[17:12.88]There's a lot of resin in here, Jesus.
[17:14.76]Power supply, I got it.
[17:19.28]Why is this, this is like the most, I got lazy here.
[17:22.02]They just put like 10 resin in this room.
[17:23.60]You don't have to look for it.
[17:26.65]Cool.
[17:30.97]Thank you.
[17:38.64]Okay, I hit something.
[17:41.70]I wanted to play with this.
[17:43.44]I knew you could play with this.
[17:44.75]This is a better bartender simulator than the bartender game we were playing last night.
[17:48.89]Never mind.
[17:55.53]Really?
[17:55.85]Oh.
[17:55.91]Hey, Kit.
[18:16.96]Here we go.
[18:18.32]Elevator main power is now... Ooh, now I can see.
[18:20.59]I can see what the hell we're doing.
[18:23.55]Take this from me.
[18:25.13]Look at the actual bottles of liquid.
[18:28.95]Come on.
[18:32.25]Can I touch this?
[18:32.85]I feel like you wouldn't want to put your hand in here.
[18:36.14]Okay, to the elevator.
[18:46.24]What's going on here?
[18:48.16]What's going on here?
[18:48.86]In a minute.
[18:51.04]In a minute.
[18:53.99]What's going?
[18:59.79]Okay.
[19:01.09]Where?
[19:01.37]Where's that going?
[19:06.29]Nothing even in these boxes.
[19:09.56]What are they doing here?
[19:18.11]I hear somebody moving behind me.
[19:19.45]Why?
[19:26.47]Ah.
[19:27.93]Ah, damn it.
[19:28.61]Is that... Nice, hey, nice cable management, dickhead.
[19:35.63]This is a big one.
[19:42.69]Dude, this is a fucking huge one.
[19:44.15]What the hell?
[19:51.52]Let's check the elevator.
[19:57.59]I forget how you activate a grenade.
[19:59.55]I don't remember.
[20:00.11]I don't remember how to do that.
[20:16.53]Look at the bottle.
[20:17.43]Look at the bottle.
[20:18.05]Top button.
[20:18.81]Okay.
[20:20.31]I'll look at the bottles in a second.
[20:23.29]Alright, we don't need the lamp.
[20:25.59]Where the fuck is this?
[20:26.39]I'm not tall enough for this.
[20:28.69]This is like trying to reach the top cupboard in your house.
[20:31.83]If you're under six feet tall, you know what I'm talking about.
[20:34.11]Just all of your top cabinets have nothing in them.
[20:39.17]They just don't have anything in them because why would you put it there?
[20:40.99]You need a stepstool to get them.
[20:42.02]Anyone under six feet gets it.
[20:49.44]Just leave that thing on the ground.
[21:00.23]Where is this going?
[21:01.89]Get over here.
[21:08.91]Right there, I can see it.
[21:09.99]I can't turn it?
[21:31.88]Right there!
[21:33.18]Move this painting.
[21:35.52]Oh.
[21:38.26]Okay, actual, like, hidden electricity safe.
[21:41.00]Okay.
[21:47.13]I wasn't prete- I- Power back on.
[21:48.49]Oh.
[21:48.57]Bottles!
[22:07.75]Looks like we're taking the ladder.
[22:09.75]Bottles, bottles.
[22:10.71]Somebody said look at the bottles.
[22:17.36]Don't let me forget that.
[22:18.40]What do the bottles say?
[22:19.44]3 8th NBB
[22:33.39]Why do I want to read these?
[22:40.65]Is that the wrong language selected?
[22:44.77]Liquid physics.
[22:56.20]I feel like I'm going to hit something.
[22:58.08]Alright, so why do you want me to read that?
[23:00.34]I don't understand.
[23:00.86]They're all in Russian.
[23:06.42]I can't read these.
[23:10.33]I don't get it.
[23:10.75]Is there a joke I'm missing or something?
[23:12.23]What am I hitting?
[23:15.37]Don't read them.
[23:15.97]Liquid physics and refractions.
[23:17.67]Oh, okay.
[23:18.57]What is this?
[23:19.55]2008?
[23:21.61]Why do I care about moving liquid like water in a water level and light bouncing off the door?
[23:27.08]What happened?
[23:36.95]Enter your... What the fuck happened?
[23:49.55]Did it... Why is everything crashing?
[23:53.25]Stream VR desktop game theater?
[24:00.72]What is this?
[24:02.98]What the hell?
[24:03.46]Did that save it?
[24:06.40]Got VAC banned.
[24:08.02]I did not get VAC banned.
[24:12.78]I think my SteamVR just crashed.
[24:16.91]Fucking motorcycle game.
[24:20.29]That motorcycle game has cursed.
[24:24.45]It's not even the motorcycle game.
[24:27.01]I gave that game a lot of shit for no reason.
[24:30.05]Um, okay.
[24:31.31]But you guys can't even see anything.
[24:35.65]Let's just go back in and see what happens.
[24:38.91]Weird.
[24:41.09]Is my Steam even... I don't even have Steam anymore.
[24:50.02]God damn it.
[24:50.66]Alright, hold on.
[24:52.62]I might actually have to restart my computer.
[24:57.90]It's supposed to be a Triple H Steam game!
[25:00.97]No!
[25:01.23]No!
[25:07.83]Not again!
[25:08.55]We were just playing, man!
[25:11.95]Hold on, let me see if I have to do this or not.
[25:13.65]Okay.
[25:21.90]Open it up.
[25:25.76]Uh-huh.
[25:27.80]Half-Life Alyx.
[25:28.92]Alright, please tell me I don't have to redo this.
[25:30.56]The fuck is this doing?
[25:37.71]Why is it opening up a game theater for this toolkit now?
[25:42.41]It's just showing, like, everything on my desktop.
[25:45.91]This is fucking bizarre.
[25:47.01]Come on.
[25:56.80]All this shit is so fucked up.
[25:58.58]Alright, let me open this.
[26:03.49]Wait, did that take it over, or is that good?
[26:08.03]Stupid modus, uh, say you like the liquid physics.
[26:15.35]I mean, they're cool!
[26:15.89]What do you want me to say?
[26:21.53]Dude, I have no picture at all.
[26:23.85]There we go, hold on.
[26:27.17]Alright, they're cool, fine.
[26:28.92]Is that what you want?
[26:34.35]I got the game back, but what the fuck happened to my, like, actual, my toolkit, my OVR toolkit?
[26:39.31]It just, like, exploded, and I can't even open it anymore.
[26:41.51]Give me a break.
[26:45.62]Hold on, sorry.
[26:46.52]I, I, this is, like, just a bizarre issue that I've never seen before.
[26:51.20]We're getting just bizarre problems that just didn't, I just, for no reason, they happened two days in a row.
[27:01.40]Okay, so anytime I open up OVR Toolkit, it takes over everything.
[27:05.32]It deletes the game I'm playing.
[27:08.11]And goes into, like, this desktop game theater.
[27:12.05]This is something that's... I have no... I'm gonna have to play the game without chat.
[27:15.09]This is fucking nuts.
[27:20.97]Like, why is SteamVR Desktop Game Theater opening when I put on, like, the chat window thing?
[27:26.67]Try killing the task for it.
[27:28.05]Hold on.
[27:31.18]The fucking stream's gonna turn off, guarantee it.
[27:33.64]Oh, there's nothing there?
[27:39.29]Hold on.
[27:41.35]God damn it, why?
[27:42.59]It's two days in a row.
[27:44.43]Why can't this shit just work?
[27:48.05]Sit down at your pilot station and get ready to play VR with chat.
[27:51.61]I'm gonna restart SteamVR.
[27:57.73]I got a fresh install of Windows.
[28:00.29]It's been cleaned and wiped.
[28:05.43]Let's try this.
[28:13.60]Get a better computer.
[28:14.54]Yeah, I would, but no computer parts exist.
[28:19.46]I'm going to get a brand new computer.
[28:21.02]There are no 3080s, no 3090s, no 3070s, no new CPUs.
[28:22.06]Everything's gone.
[28:22.70]There's no RAM.
[28:37.12]Yeah, I could get, like, reliably a fucking case.
[28:40.32]And just put paper in it and pretend there's a computer in there.
[28:43.48]Get a 2080.
[28:44.06]Idiot.
[28:44.52]No!
[28:44.76]That's all technology!
[28:48.25]Okay, let me try this again.
[28:49.49]If not, I'm just gonna have to play without chat.
[28:50.93]That sucks, but whatever. ...
[29:01.91]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[29:05.35]Oh, baby!
[29:06.55]I think we're good to go!
[29:07.81]Finally, computers!
[29:12.39]Please tell me this is fine after I just rebooted Steam, like, three times.
[29:15.19]It's so stupid.
[29:19.39]I didn't do anything.
[29:20.29]I just... Yeah, sorry, guys.
[29:21.65]I have a 1080.
[29:21.97]Roast me!

[38:26.68]A little tingly.
[38:34.41]I feel like I don't want to do that.

[39:06.86]Oh, really?
[39:08.32]What does it reek like?
[39:09.46]Be specific.

[40:57.67]You're still on that.
[40:59.45]You're still on that, guys.
[41:01.23]You're still on it.
[41:25.94]Does that man have a tiny face?
[41:27.10]What's this thing doing?
[41:30.82]What is that, and why is it doing that?
[41:33.02]Why is it doing that?
[41:33.86]What is that?
[41:34.42]I don't know what that is, but I don't know why it's doing this.
[41:43.25]What is that?
[41:43.67]Should I take it?
[41:46.65]Oh, sorry!
[41:47.21]I just want the thing that's in your hand.
[41:58.60]Give me!

[43:03.06]Okay, we're good.
[43:10.16]Oh shit, what is that?
[43:16.57]Oh man, a blast of berry flavor.
[43:20.01]Whoa, don't think you can handle it?
[43:22.75]I'll try doing two at the same time.
[43:43.48]Oh, sick.
[43:45.72]Oh, this is like 700.
[43:46.40]Bye bye.
[44:13.67]Who else wants this shit?
[44:16.33]Oh, man.
[44:17.53]An introducing green apple.
[44:22.85]That would hurt.
[44:24.35]That would hurt my teeth.
[44:26.11]Mom, I think I have to go to the hospital.
[44:45.71]No T. Uh, Reset, thank you.
[45:05.26]Ah!
[45:07.82]Ah!
[45:27.09]It looks like he's just... moving.

[45:44.10]Sit- wait!
[45:46.08]Ah!
[45:51.84]Okay, let's make sure we're loaded.
[45:57.62]Guys, load it up and ready to rock and roll.
[46:06.90]One of those doors that only one side opens, OK.
[46:08.78]Hey, now, I'm in the right spot, kind of.
[46:19.81]Oh.
[46:22.03]You see that?
[46:25.25]They're trembling.
[46:50.01]Who's the sorry bastard that's going to take this one right between the eyes?
[47:02.06]Oh.
[47:02.94]I need this.
[47:15.42]Mark.
[47:20.92]I have electricity?
[47:21.70]That thing doesn't have electricity to it.
[47:28.68]What the fuck?
[47:31.75]Come on.
[47:32.57]No.
[47:32.93]Am I doing this wrong?
[47:39.73]I'll just leave it there for now.
[47:41.00]I'll get it.
[47:41.82]Gotta get a power source.
[47:45.46]The laundry room.
[47:58.73]Where did that thing go?
[48:00.21]What's that thing vulnerable to?
[48:01.21]Fire.
[48:04.01]Lightning.
[48:04.55]Okay, it's vulnerable to Earth.
[48:07.02]Like a leaf spell.
[48:10.54]What the?
[48:12.72]Hey, no pictures!
[48:14.70]No photos!
[48:15.36]You gotta pay for that!
[48:18.53]Oh, come on in, yeah, okay, 10 bucks.
[48:21.30]Cool, say Twitch!
[48:23.14]On TV slash chairman, thanks, man.

[48:36.02]Wow!
[48:37.19]Stop doing that!
[48:41.11]Stop doing that!
[48:42.77]Hey, no pictures!
[48:51.90]This guy sucks!
[48:54.02]Am I dumb to creep up on him?
[49:23.92]Get over here!
[49:29.39]He's still alive!
[49:37.66]Alright, go to the chamber!
[49:56.95]That looks good, I would eat that.
[49:57.95]That looks like a cool, that looks like ice cream.
[50:00.60]That's like blueberry cream ice cream.
[50:03.76]I would just like shawarma style, man.
[50:05.42]I would just carve some of this off, just like into a cone.
[50:12.07]Where is this weird little stingray guy?
[50:24.88]I feel like he's just playing, he's toying with me.
[50:26.78]You got a ceiling?
[50:29.60]Over here.
[50:38.59]You little fucker!
[50:40.45]Get back here!
[50:42.93]Get over here!
[50:44.43]I'm up!
[51:02.06]What?
[51:09.11]He dead?
[51:21.43]He's still alive!
[51:24.14]What?
[51:31.55]Oh, shit!
[51:33.69]Ah!
[51:34.69]Um, what?
[51:39.40]What's going on?
[51:40.84]What happened to him?
[51:49.96]Alex?
[51:50.62]Alex, what happened?
[51:51.64]There was, like, a dog-looking lightning thing.
[51:55.56]Oh, I'm sorry.
[51:56.24]I missed that.
[51:58.05]That was the boss.
[51:58.79]I killed it and it crapped out this thing.
[52:02.91]Put it on top of an ice cream cone.
[52:06.95]It's blue cream, Alex.
[52:08.02]Ah!
[52:08.22]Where's it go?
[52:31.32]Oh shit, that could be used in place of a, you know.
[52:43.60]Alright, I don't wanna look at it.
[52:47.08]If I don't look at it, it doesn't hurt as much.
[52:48.83]Done?
[52:49.39]All done, Jeremy.
[52:50.97]Ow.
[53:01.80]Here's a lollipop.
[53:02.80]Oh, thank you.
[53:07.80]Good.
[53:08.72]A little health.
[53:11.58]Numbered shots.
[53:13.22]Oh!
[53:36.39]Have you ever rushed Jeremy?
[53:37.34]He's not jittery because of the game.
[53:44.58]He's jittery because he went Old Turkey?
[53:48.82]Wait, what?
[53:49.58]Where did you get this shirt that says Jeremy?
[54:00.09]It was given to me from a gift.
[54:10.36]You don't gotta capture a different window.
[54:16.98]Yeah, this is spectator capture right now.
[54:18.84]This isn't VR view.
[54:21.01]This is not the... Where are you?
[54:23.43]There you are.
[54:24.09]This is not mirror capture, this is actual in-game capture.
[54:28.13]And I have the spectator view on smoothing and everything.
[54:30.09]Am I just like a jittery fucking mess?
[54:33.74]Is that what the problem is?
[54:50.03]Again?
[54:50.83]Is it bad?
[54:51.31]Should I turn the volume down?
[54:52.51]I mean, when I turn away from the microphone, yeah, that's definitely gonna happen.
[54:58.93]Alright, what is it, 10 minutes left in the game?
[55:03.36]It's like the end, right?
[55:18.13]Oh shit, it's one of these, okay.
[55:20.34]Red.
[55:20.60]Red.
[55:22.74]Red.
[55:23.80]Blue, blue.
[55:24.34]I got it already.
[55:27.14]Okay, come on.
[55:31.21]Wizard of S.H.I.E.L.D.
[55:32.27]Fuck.
[55:35.75]Oh, no.
[55:36.41]I... I have... I didn't notice.
[55:38.71]Um... Um...
[55:50.89]I don't remember where they were.
[55:52.95]Red.
[55:53.15]Where's red?
[55:53.95]That's an orange.
[55:57.33]That's right.
[55:57.69]That's red.
[55:58.07]Red.
[56:00.31]Red.
[56:03.35]That was weird.
[56:04.03]I don't know.
[56:04.85]That was weird.
[56:05.45]I don't know why I just did it.
[56:06.29]Alright.

[57:37.30]A shit talker.
[57:40.66]There it is.
[57:42.20]That elevator will take me up to the substation.
[57:52.26]BOOM!
[57:52.66]Did I do it?
[57:54.87]Wait, did I actually just do it?
[58:05.75]What the fuck?

[58:07.15]There's a guy there!
[58:09.27]Oh yeah, no no no no no.

[58:32.47]Alright, there is explosive in there.
[58:46.78]You know.
[58:48.38]Just give me.
[58:49.80]Give me that.

[59:09.29]Oh shit, sorry dude.
[59:23.55]Wait, wait, wait, I gotta do a video game.
[59:26.40]I gotta do every single video game ever developed.
[59:28.58]Right, I forgot.
[59:37.03]Oh, yeah, fun, cool.
[59:37.99]Let's use that mechanic a thousand times.
[59:54.13]What was the point of doing it?
[60:00.71]How are you?
[60:03.75]What was that?
[60:04.31]Why did I... What was that for?
[60:08.63]Something in here?
[60:09.25]Credit shelf.

[60:26.76]Why?
[60:28.93]Wait, what do you want me to do?
[60:31.91]Resin on the shelf somewhere?
[60:32.87]Do you see resin?
[60:36.01]Where do you see resin?
[60:39.65]Up.
[60:40.03]There it is.
[60:40.63]Up.
[60:47.85]Is that a shelf or is that a duct?
[60:52.24]That's not a shelf.
[60:53.00]That's a duct.
[61:03.50]Grab.
[61:13.02]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[61:58.85]We're supposed to go down here anyways, who cares?
[62:00.69]I have no shotgun ammo.
[62:12.00]Waste, waste, waste.
[62:13.12]I got plenty, I don't care.
[62:23.82]There's a little puppet show going on over there.
[62:27.22]Let's see.
[62:28.90]Hey guys!
[62:29.68]Hey fellas!
[62:30.20]There's an eagle!

[63:00.42]Station.
[63:01.14]Station.
[63:02.70]Hey, come on out.
[63:05.70]Well, this is the part of the movie.
[63:07.18]This is the part of the movie where the main character's in here right now.
[63:11.82]And they just know that I'm right underneath, and they go... Any second I could just shoot where you are, couldn't I?
[63:25.34]Oh, thank God he missed us.
[63:30.86]Can I use this?
[63:31.34]There's a lot of health down here.
[63:36.55]Why?
[63:37.45]Oh, there's a pocket.
[63:43.39]I don't have a pocket.
[63:55.47]Oh, there's something in there.
[64:00.59]Again!
[64:15.39]Alright, again, swipe the Dave & Buster's card again, for God's sakes.
[64:23.74]I'll get it.
[64:24.80]I'm getting those 500 tickets.
[64:35.04]Panic?
[64:36.00]I didn't panic.
[64:37.76]You panicked.
[64:45.01]What's going in this vat?
[64:48.89]Alright, I need a power source.
[64:51.33]There's a shitload of health down here.
[64:56.82]Why is there so much health down here?
[64:59.00]Secret.
[65:05.24]I'm going to put all the health in one spot.
[65:10.33]All the health is going over here.
[65:13.21]On this barrel.
[65:14.17]This is my healing station.
[65:16.55]It's my, like, healing shell.
[65:21.92]Wait, can I put it in a box and just take it with me?
[65:26.00]Yeah, I can.
[65:28.26]Get your ass, that's what I'm fucking doing.
[65:31.15]We're going trick-or-treating, guys.
[65:41.61]This is my fucking health bucket.
[65:43.73]It's coming with us everywhere.
[65:56.49]And this is the fourth one somewhere.
[65:57.73]I saw it.
[66:04.04]Fourth healing thing over here.
[66:05.32]I know I saw it.
[66:11.10]Oh, trick or treat.
[66:11.98]Oh, nice.
[66:12.44]What'd you get?
[66:13.30]Oh, whoa.

[66:20.52]Oh, you get three each?
[66:27.96]That's right, kids.
[66:29.39]Those are full-size candy bars.
[66:31.73]I'm an asshole.
[66:37.09]Remember, remember, rob this house.
[66:40.27]Here you go, kids.
[66:41.43]Line up.
[66:41.87]Here's a full-size three-seats for everybody.
[66:44.79]I'm the house to rob.
[66:47.17]Thank you, kids.
[66:47.86]Have a great day.
[66:51.42]What happened to them?
[66:58.16]Raid song?
[66:58.86]We got a raid?
[66:59.82]Who raided?
[67:06.39]A raid?

[67:14.22]Raid song, raid song, raid song.
[67:18.42]Who, but who is the, I can't sing the song unless I know who raided.
[67:21.44]Master Gear.
[67:26.34]Master Gear, thanks for the raid.
[67:32.33]That was kind of, I don't know, a thank you.
[67:36.27]Why I did that.
[67:36.93]I don't know what that, that doesn't mean anything, apparently, I don't know.
[67:41.27]I was so nervous that you raided me.
[67:46.55]I go, well, that's when they all leave.
[67:48.33]No, they're here.
[67:53.18]Okay, this is where we're going.
[67:54.40]I keep losing my... Give me that.
[68:01.88]My trick-or-treat basket.
[68:04.43]I'm going to fill this thing with trick-or-treat items.
[68:06.77]It's a Halloween string now.
[68:09.70]Hey, oh, there's only two slots in your inventory.
[68:12.13]No, there's 60.
[68:14.18]Just gotta fucking bring it with you.
[68:41.52]Don't forget my trick-or-treat basket.
[68:50.46]Oh, my God, he let his foot down.
[68:55.14]Russell?
[68:59.30]Oh, no.
[69:00.24]Okay, don't touch anything metal.
[69:02.30]Don't touch anything metal.
[69:22.19]Hey, don't go near my trick-or-treats.
[69:25.19]Come here.
[69:38.87]Oh, he's in the bed somewhere.
[69:41.69]Hmm.
[69:42.95]Okay, where's that fucking main character?
[69:47.58]He's in there going right now.
[69:48.36]He's like...
[69:58.86]That went right by his ear.
[70:00.76]And he went to the secondary main character that was right next to him, behind him.
[70:06.71]If I'm in that movie, I'm just going to fucking go like this.
[70:22.02]Alright, fuck it, he's gone.
[70:26.09]Actual villain.
[70:31.05]Do I drink or drink?
[70:35.27]No more fucking throw-up jokes.
[70:38.28]If I do another throw-up joke, I will end the stream, I promise.
[70:44.16]That's like such low, that's so easy.
[70:49.48]Oh shit, awesome!
[70:52.09]Oh dude, what do they got here?
[70:56.91]Guys!
[70:57.59]Oh, take five?

[71:00.82]Cool.
[71:16.45]Okay, uh, those of you guys that never played Diablo 3, this is just the bounty boxes.
[71:24.46]When this gets full, I'm gonna just sit there and open bounty cubes for like 10 minutes.
[71:28.40]Okay, let's go.
[71:42.88]Am I supposed to turn on something?
[71:50.00]Oh, no!
[71:50.52]That guy!
[71:51.00]I gotta kill that thing and get the electricity thing.
[71:54.57]Don't just leave.
[72:05.37]You pillowcase full of Halloween candy down the ground.
[72:28.29]That was close.
[72:34.32]Dude, that went right by my face.
[72:56.96]Where is it?

[73:44.51]It was nuts, Russell.
[73:46.15]It sounds nuts.
[73:46.95]Nice.
[73:47.67]Oh, it was.
[73:57.59]I think they're starting to fall out of the bottom.
[74:04.69]Watch it explode?
[74:06.49]Why would it explode?
[74:07.55]Fuck.
[74:18.80]Okay.
[74:19.56]Okay.

[80:54.23]He says be a worrier, but shouldn't Dad be back by now?
[80:58.71]Well, let's think about it, Alex.
[80:59.95]He's on foot, moving at three miles an hour.
[81:02.22]Plus, he's a fugitive.
[81:03.44]He's only got one leg.
[81:04.38]There's obstacles.
[81:05.56]No direct path.
[81:07.82]You know what?
[81:08.30]I'm not going to lie to you.
[81:09.22]He should be back by now.
[81:11.12]Yeah.
[81:11.38]So I should be worried.
[81:15.52]What's that?
[81:15.84]Hi.
[81:47.54]Oh, it's one of these hard ones.
[81:49.68]Okay.

[82:02.39]I don't know what these ones are.
[82:07.37]Yes.
[82:08.92]Yes.
[82:10.54]Not a good guess.

[83:49.40]Let's see what I can do.
[83:55.20]Okay, bullet reservoir.
[84:00.38]And additional bullets.
[84:01.28]That's a big deal, man.
[84:02.66]That's a huge deal.
[84:05.98]I'm going with the bullet.
[84:06.72]I have one more ammo.
[84:07.42]Yeah, oh yeah.
[84:09.66]That's what, that's what I'm doing.

[84:39.85]What the fuck?
[84:40.25]Where's the grenade launcher?
[84:41.35]I don't know.
[84:42.27]It's a grenade launcher?
[84:44.79]Thanks for the spoiler.
[84:45.65]Thanks for telling me how Infinity War ends.
[84:48.39]Can I get a grenade launcher?
[84:49.49]I'm gonna scoff.
[84:50.15]Hello, twitch.tv admin?

[85:39.12]Hey, hey, look, it's me.
[85:41.72]There's the monitor.
[85:42.65]That's what I'm looking at.
[85:43.23]That's me after every VR stream.
[85:46.13]Hey, guys, I just want to let you know that, uh, yeah, I think it's been about four hours.
[85:51.75]I can't do it anymore.
[85:52.63]I'd rather, like, take a bath and do a hair treatment.
[85:55.82]Yeah, it's fun, though.
[85:56.68]Relax.
[86:01.08]Go lie down, Jeremy.
[86:03.78]That's not a good bed.
[86:08.39]This bed sucks.
[86:09.57]Holy shit.
[86:12.78]Dude.
[86:14.48]Why are you living like this?
[86:17.06]Why are you making like a bed, a blanket out of wood?
[86:21.34]Is this Minecraft?
[86:40.19]Oh, what's that?
[86:51.70]What happened?
[86:52.16]Why'd the room just explode?
[87:14.88]Read the bottle, read the bottle, read the bottle, read the bottle.
[87:18.78]Hot car.
[87:20.28]Uh, hold on.
[87:23.27]Pants adjustment.
[87:27.03]I need a pants adjustment.
[87:28.95]We're on in a sec, guys.
[87:30.08]Thank you for letting John and Dave just do a little pants adjustment.
[87:34.08]Here we go.
[87:37.16]I just make sure the old, uh... It's just what happens.
[87:41.68]Every door opens this way.
[87:42.78]I hate that.
[87:44.08]I want doors to open in.
[87:45.58]Uh-oh.
[87:46.99]Oh, there he is.
[87:49.87]Irma?
[87:51.99]Irma, you alright?
[87:52.73]Yeah, I just... I was gonna take a bath and put oil in my hair.
[87:57.26]I just really crawled over here.
[88:00.23]Yeah, I'm going to be okay.
[88:01.37]There's oil all over my hair and shit.
[88:04.04]There's olive oil and tea tree.
[88:06.10]Yeah, I haven't really turned on the water yet, though.
[88:10.62]Alright, man, just relax.
[88:12.85]Take a bath.
[88:14.25]Let that oil get a-seeping all over your hair.
[88:23.58]Boots and jeans.
[88:24.54]That's not my look.
[88:33.19]Need to reload twice.
[88:34.29]Dude, was that a lie?
[88:45.43]Was that a lie?
[88:49.79]I think that was a lie.
[88:59.63]Oh shit, alright, nice.
[89:05.41]Definitely putting on the new face mask has helped a lot.
[89:11.07]Check the mag.
[89:11.81]What?
[89:20.47]Need to drop the mag.
[89:25.65]I'll test it out.
[89:30.40]Toy boat.
[89:30.80]Toy boat guy.
[89:35.94]Okay.
[89:36.70]So, mag has been ejected.
[89:41.48]Empty inserted magazine.
[89:43.32]Press to eject magazine.
[89:45.18]Guess what do you want me to do?
[89:54.40]Put a new one in.
[89:59.08]This is empty!
[90:01.12]Oh.
[90:03.10]Oh shit, I thought it was empty.
[90:07.21]Oh, alright.
[90:08.33]So you have to drop two empty magazines out?
[90:11.07]That's too much.
[90:11.89]That's stupid.
[90:16.17]Oh yeah, Game of the Year, right?
[90:18.27]Don't say anything bad about Game of the Decade!
[90:28.52]Oh! Uber!
[90:33.22]Oh, I hate those things!
[90:37.13]Blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up right now!
[90:38.11]Blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up!
[90:42.11]Uh boomer over there.
[90:50.11]Oh that's the pog room.
[90:55.11]I thought that was resin.
[91:35.03]Alright, you want me to... You want to give me a grenade, I guess.
[91:39.87]I'll take it, I guess.
[91:40.87]I mean, I guess I'll take one, I guess.
[91:44.22]Thank you.
[91:45.74]I guess, thank you.
[91:47.02]Oh, I think I got you.
[91:49.06]Got you.
[92:09.05]Oh, I guess.
[92:10.08]Oh, dude, it's Pog-flavored.
[92:20.78]Pog-flavored.
[92:21.66]What does that even mean?
[92:23.50]Alright, if there were twitch.tv... Hey.
[92:29.13]If there were twitch.tv popsicles and stuff, would you get, like, the jermaPog flavor?
[92:36.60]If I had a popsicle, if it was like a Jerma985, it would be sour.
[92:40.46]It would be a sour popsicle.
[92:44.20]Probably, um, like a raspberry.
[92:48.56]A raspberry sour flavor.
[92:57.28]Go down.
[93:00.13]Um, I should just jump.
[93:01.33]No!
[93:03.01]Okay, I'm
[93:13.57]Holy shit, just give me that.
[93:14.89]I can't make this jump?
[93:25.78]What happened?
[93:35.05]I just died instantly.
[93:36.49]Is this the one? 336?
[93:46.75]Captain Crunch.
[93:48.63]I just took a step off.
[93:58.98]Got eaten by the stairs.
[94:02.32]It wouldn't give a star flavor like that to you.
[94:06.70]You don't think I'm a star?
[94:09.32]How many stars do I have?
[94:10.30]I'm not a Twitch star enough to get a raspberry, so what flavor would I get?
[94:22.48]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[94:23.62]I'm sorry.
[94:25.16]No.
[94:25.92]You are not going to designate the banana-flavored popsicle to me.
[94:30.14]No.
[94:31.35]I'm blue raspberry or green apple or grape.
[94:34.35]You're not going to designate, like, gross banana-flavored popsicle to me.
[94:39.85]No, I'm not going to be that.
[94:50.41]How dare you.
[94:56.55]Did I even kill- Now I gotta shoot him?
[95:01.75]I didn't- Follow me, follow me in this room, follow me in this room, follow me in this room, look I'm in this room, follow me!
[95:15.10]Kill me.
[95:15.48]Kill me so I can do it again.
[95:16.90]Kill me so I can do it again.

[95:22.46]Just kill... How do I die?
[95:25.46]Just kill me.
[95:25.92]I want to do it again.
[95:27.33]This is not how this works.
[95:29.35]Don't.
[95:29.75]I'm trying to just die.
[95:30.77]I can't die.
[95:32.45]I want to do it again.
[95:35.07]Kill me.
[95:35.49]Ow.
[95:36.63]How do I... Do I have any grenades?
[95:42.74]Wait, there's a grenade in there.
[95:46.14]Give me this thing!
[95:49.20]Just let me- Are you aware of- Was that a monitor?
[95:56.12]I think that might have been a monitor.

[100:01.18]Out in a hurry, it seems.
[100:03.15]Two beds.
[100:03.63]Peppered beds.
[100:08.87]It looks like the escape route.
[100:10.77]What do we have here?
[100:12.97]What do we have here?
[100:18.41]Fill some water in there.
[100:20.57]Thirsty.

[100:28.06]was the alarm.
[100:30.92]What a mess.
[100:34.14]I wonder if, uh, maybe, uh, I wonder what happened.
[100:37.44]No, don't do that.
[100:38.18]Oops.
[100:40.84]I was gonna start going into, like, Rorschach.
[100:44.10]And the thing is, I wonder what happened in here.
[100:47.34]It's really possible that, you know, somebody could have gotten killed in here.
[100:50.17]Hold on.
[100:59.00]All those people.
[101:00.46]All those idiots.
[101:24.65]A detective.
[101:26.73]Marge Simpson.
[101:28.91]It's pretty much Rorschach.
[101:32.07]Okay, go into your favorite pitch-shifting software.
[101:35.56]Take Marge Simpson and drop the pitch by about 10%.
[101:39.02]You got Rorschach.
[101:42.80]Oh, I have to actually go out the window.
[101:52.37]As I got outside...
[101:54.37]I felt a urge to do a fall joke.
[101:58.28]But I didn't do it.
[101:59.99]Mmmm. Society.
[102:13.95]I actually fell off.
[102:32.95]I'm not trapped in here with you.
[102:35.41]I'm not trapped in here with you.
[102:36.71]Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[102:39.47]I am trapped in VR, but it being like, I'm not trapped in here with you.

[104:11.52]He finally got in.
[104:12.39]He got in the bathtub.
[104:20.91]Did I tell you about my big, long, bony fingers, too?
[104:30.72]Wait, he was just in here.
[104:33.82]What is this thing doing in here?
[104:43.41]Wait, this is the thing that flushed the toilet.
[104:53.46]I'll go in there.
[104:53.90]Alright, whatever.
[104:56.99]Jerma after VR.
[104:59.67]Oh, that's so stupid.
[105:01.23]It's so true, though.
[105:03.65]I think I did that exact pose and made that exact face last night in the bathtub.
[105:21.27]Alright, come on, come on, we're gonna home alone this guy.
[105:24.97]Come on, you're never gonna be able to catch me.

[147:56.77]I don't even know what I was trying to say.
[147:59.11]That was just filler words.
[148:02.61]Kermit doing a Fawzi impression.
[148:04.20]That was Kermit being mean and satirical fucking shit about Fawzi.
[148:12.55]Yeah, you know, I really, Fozzie's just, he's starting to get on my nerves, you know, like a worker, worker.

[150:08.74]I see the long con you're playing here.
[150:16.99]That's a long con, I'm not gonna fall for it.
[150:20.48]Hey!
[150:20.86]Hey guys, get him to Ubuntu Impressions so he does the wicked, shitty, awful Peter Griffin and we all laugh at him.
[150:27.20]What happened today?
[150:28.06]Sorry, guys.
[150:29.32]Gonna have to find another streamer that's... No, don't leave, but I'm gonna find another streamer that's gonna do those voices.
[150:34.18]Don't leave this stream.
[150:36.18]You're leaving.
[150:36.56]I don't know.
[150:37.64]I have data.
[150:42.30]Oh, okay, data, data!
[150:43.76]Uh, Captain, we're not sure what the disturbance is.
[150:55.56]Minus three.
[150:56.88]Horrible.
[150:57.38]Whatever.
[151:51.33]No, these must be on your wrists.
[151:53.27]They're on my forearms.
[151:55.93]That feels so weird.
[152:07.70]It's cutting off the circulation of my brain.
[152:09.77]Okay.
[152:12.01]There better be like a bunch of shit in here.
[152:38.47]Finally!
[152:38.87]I have full health.
[152:54.49]You know what?
[152:54.79]Just stick it in there.
[152:55.55]I'm not gonna use it, but I will later.
[153:00.97]I need it.
[153:04.31]Alright.
[153:05.65]There it is.
[153:06.71]Now, just snip those cables and off we go.
[153:09.41]Reload the gun.
[153:14.18]Happy?
[153:15.92]Happy?
[153:17.76]This is so loud, I can't hear anything.
[153:33.19]This isn't going to be as easy as it looked from the ground.
[155:39.84]No one tell him.
[155:42.68]I don't... I just cut the wires, but I... Russ, I can't figure out how to disconnect these cables.
[155:55.21]Maybe try opening the cable shielding and shooting them.
[155:57.97]That's what I was doing!
[156:00.05]That's what I was doing!
[156:02.47]That's what I did!
[156:03.55]That's what I tried!
[156:08.62]Oh, okay.
[156:12.00]Nice.
[156:12.62]There you go.
[156:20.31]Whoa.
[156:21.35]Oh, shit.
[156:22.85]There it goes.
[156:27.49]Another one.
[156:38.54]Wait, isn't that holding us up?
[156:41.84]Great.
[156:42.36]Now go inside and deactivate the power source.
[156:44.26]All of a sudden we just start falling down.
[157:04.28]What the hell is that?
[157:11.03]Alright?
[157:17.28]We have been trapped in the dark.
[157:20.84]You're free now.
[157:22.20]It's OK.
[157:23.70]Your friend sent me.
[157:25.52]Leave, Alex Vance.
[157:27.85]That's me.
[157:28.95]You are our friend.
[157:32.87]What are they doing to you here?
[157:47.27]Wait, they just, they put them in these machines?
[157:48.99]That's where they get their power?
[157:50.89]The Combine drain from us the power they use to protect their weapon.
[157:58.20]There, there, there, we are ripped from ourselves.
[158:04.94]We have to stop them from killing your friends.
[158:06.48]We gotta go do this three more times.
[158:07.36]The Vortigaunts will extract ourselves and exact our own vengeance.
[158:12.36]You must go to the weapon.
[158:15.20]What?
[158:16.53]I can't get into the vault if the substations are still online.
[158:19.99]Do not worry, Alex Vance.
[158:22.51]They will not be.
[158:25.07]We will not allow it.
[158:28.57]I will clear the path.
[158:33.27]Unhand.
[158:46.61]We are good Terminus.
[158:51.87]Thanks.
[158:53.27]Good luck.
[158:54.66]Here!
[158:55.10]You might need this!
[158:55.84]Fucking cat.
[159:05.20]Hold on, can I like cheese slice my head off?
[159:19.32]There's a lot of trust in that Vortigaunt to shut down all the substations.
[159:22.73]I... I trust him.
[159:24.43]Yes, me too.
[159:26.69]Uh, if he doesn't, well, that vault isn't going anywhere, and we'll be standing there with no vault to break into, surrounded by Combine.
[159:33.78]Russ, trusting him is our only plan here.
[159:37.94]He'll do this.
[159:39.16]We can do this.
[159:40.60]Yes, you're right.
[159:41.76]He'll be fine.
[159:42.65]We're all going to be fine.
[159:54.38]I'm taking this one.
[159:59.97]Okay.
[160:01.09]Oh, uh, where to?
[160:05.47]I gotta go towards the weapon, right?
[160:08.53]Oh, shit!
[160:27.36]Everything's okay!
[160:59.78]Oh my goodness!
[161:00.60]Aye!
[161:01.36]Aye!
[161:01.96]Oh!
[161:02.16]Aye!
[161:03.88]Ow!

[161:12.77]Full-clip Andy!
[161:14.41]Full-clip Andy!
[161:34.97]Where's that grenade?
[161:35.84]Oh no, it's Reinhardt!
[161:37.62]What?!
[161:37.86]Alex?
[161:39.16]Alex!
[161:39.66]Fuck.
[161:40.18]What'd I say?
[161:41.94]This is just like shitty one-word impressions.
[162:04.53]It's like what I've been doing for the last 30 fucking minutes.
[162:10.51]Shoot the guy.
[162:12.03]Shoot the guy.
[162:22.98]Reload from Raisin.
[162:24.78]Alright, I'm ready this time.
[162:28.86]No F-U-C-K-I-N-G around.
[162:34.88]I'm going to go make this guy eat this.
[162:37.42]Ready?
[162:37.58]We're going to sit on the bench.
[162:40.12]Check this out.
[162:46.63]This is my little battle station.
[163:09.79]Oh, my God.
[163:41.66]Jesus!
[163:42.42]Who's left?
[163:47.45]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[164:14.47]Hey!
[164:15.33]What's this?
[164:19.90]Oh, I'm falling already!
[164:59.27]Cue realism!
[165:01.89]Individuals, you are now charged with multiple level 5 anti-civil activity violations.
[165:23.24]This is the smallest soda I've ever seen.
[165:58.04]I got three tape measure bombs.
[166:01.00]Now I just want... The big guy died over here somewhere.
[166:03.90]That's what I want.
[166:06.88]Okay.
[166:07.32]Did the big guy die?
[166:22.22]No.
[166:22.50]Let's go.
[166:35.24]Go over the light.
[166:42.72]Okay.
[166:45.44]Go over the... I was already in here.
[166:47.52]I already did this.
[166:51.88]Okay, bye.
[166:53.14]Wait!
[167:08.80]Hey, that hurts you!
[167:09.84]I'm just trying to see where it goes!
[167:22.39]Oh, stop it!
[167:57.92]How much resin do I have?
[167:58.82]Twelve?
[167:59.30]That's not enough.
[168:01.48]That's not enough.
[168:06.70]Let's see what this is.
[168:11.41]Light laser sight, extended mag.
[168:17.39]Light extended mag.
[168:21.57]I don't have a present.
[168:39.60]I don't have a resident.
[168:41.74]I don't have enough residents.
[168:43.70]Going up.
[169:11.14]Um, hey, go the wrong way.
[169:22.03]Oh, fuck.
[169:50.78]Oh shit, I'm sorry!
[169:57.80]Oh shit, it's gone crazy.
[169:58.94]Oh.
[169:59.34]Take one of these.
[170:15.57]Alright, what do I have for, uh, I need ammo.
[170:23.17]Good, good, good, good.
[170:24.59]Let's keep going.
[170:26.37]Resin.
[170:26.99]I need some resin viewers here.
[170:36.62]Thank you for the, yep.
[170:44.54]More viewers!
[170:46.43]I can tell me with resonance.
[170:49.47]Okay, let's go.
[170:51.37]Right here.
[171:08.24]No, no, no, no, I almost just had to delete my Twitch channel.
[171:12.21]Almost.
[171:13.45]Almost had to delete my Twitch channel.
[171:15.29]What was the thing I said if I didn't know the puke thing?
[171:27.08]Mines now, of course there is.
[171:28.42]Okay, is that a head?
[171:31.28]A head and an arm that has their arm like this.
[171:36.32]Like ready to shoot me with a gun.
[171:38.46]Right?
[171:39.24]A little brim for the hat.
[171:40.58]That's a person aiming a gun.
[171:46.51]Got him.
[171:58.30]Moving.
[172:03.25]Thank you, I want that bad.
[172:18.99]Oh, Reset.
[172:24.55]Buzzing.
[172:26.75]Buzzing.
[172:51.54]I hear a pig.
[172:52.26]I hear a pig.
[172:53.84]That means Combine's wrong.
[172:54.90]Oh, who is it?
[173:11.59]Who is it?
[173:13.69]Where are they?
[173:27.78]I'm trying to shoot things with his legs!
[174:18.98]Is this fresh TV?
[174:26.07]Not a fresh TV.
[174:43.88]Shakin' my head, yeah.
[174:45.76]Shakin' my goddamn head.
[174:53.72]Fuck you!
[174:54.96]Are they saying my name?
[174:57.86]Yeah, that's not good.
[175:28.09]Open up everything.
[175:28.89]Let's see.
[175:29.19]Anything else in here?
[175:32.49]They're doing an impression.
[175:33.73]It's me, Alex.
[175:37.31]Look at me.
[175:51.80]Wait, I know what I can do.
[175:53.24]We're going to whip a chair out there.
[175:55.58]We're going to whip a chair out there, and we're going to close the door.
[176:10.23]It worked perfectly.
[176:11.33]Exactly what was planned.
[176:12.69]Exactly what I intended.
[176:13.97]Oh my god!
[177:00.41]I didn't know I had to go.
[177:05.87]That's every single time I ever play an online shooter, seriously.
[177:09.72]Battlefield, Call of Duty, Fortnite.
[177:13.86]Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[177:14.66]I get into a firefight.
[177:15.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[177:17.54]They don't die.
[177:18.12]And then I freak out and I run away and I die.
[177:21.17]They kill me.
[177:24.01]Every encounter I've ever had online.
[177:31.11]Let's do this right.
[177:32.45]Can I... Where's my sh...
[177:55.76]Drop it.
[177:58.44]Okay, I'm ready.
[177:59.76]Now show yourself, you Call of Duty camper.
[178:10.23]I shot the guy in the head like seven times.
[178:18.91]Target is still active.
[178:24.01]Pressure on him.
[178:33.42]Load it up.
[178:34.64]Three bags left.
[178:37.03]Okay.
[178:38.25]That wasn't so bad, was it?
[179:03.23]You guys have ammo?
[179:03.67]You guys have nothing on you?
[179:05.59]That's disappointing.
[179:08.23]Oh, you did.
[179:11.87]Eat that now.
[179:12.49]Let's save it.
[179:23.62]Are the, uh, the Vortigaunts in there?
[179:25.00]Could be.
[179:29.18]Fresh TV.
[179:30.26]Don't fuck this up this time.
[179:54.93]He held it with one hand.
[179:59.45]Alright, let's go.
[180:10.55]Bye.
[180:18.51]Really?
[180:21.85]Oh, man.
[180:22.25]Oh, look who it is.
[180:22.79]They're saying it's Omega Lowland.
[180:43.40]Omega Lola Andy.
[180:44.70]Hey, dude.
[180:45.14]Long time fan here.
[180:45.82]I've been watching.
[180:46.78]I'm wondering if you've been hyping up that Erythra reveal stream for a couple months now.
[180:50.88]Call a date.
[180:51.86]Call a date for that.
[180:52.72]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[181:00.45]Back here?
[181:09.27]Oh, dude.
[181:09.79]Okay.
[181:11.27]What up?
[181:16.25]Don't fall.
[181:25.53]I'm getting tangled, I can already feel it.
[181:27.05]I got a bottle or something I can throw over there?
[181:35.38]That box.
[181:40.58]What the fuck?
[181:41.98]I'll take it.
[181:56.89]Good work.
[182:05.73]Oh megalola.
[182:16.63]Fuck, what happened?
[182:20.18]Hello, oh megalo, copy pasting, oh megalo.
[182:32.18]You know what I will tell you about Half- Alyx?
[182:35.62]The movement in the game is the best of any VR title that has released.
[182:40.30]That's a fact.
[182:43.46]It is just the best movement in a VR game.
[182:48.68]It's very, very easy to control.
[182:51.36]Shut up.
[182:52.46]Nobody talk.
[183:09.82]I can't do it.
[183:10.36]It's not possible.
[183:10.92]You just can't do it.
[183:12.25]It's way too awkward to think just into falling down.
[183:16.01]And not carry it around.
[183:19.01]Oh, your dad's back.
[183:20.24]Oh, thank God.
[183:21.46]Russell!
[183:21.66]What?
[183:21.92]God damn it's good to see you.
[183:24.84]Likewise.
[183:25.40]Oh, this is great.
[183:27.42]Honestly, I pegged your survival at about 4%.
[183:29.30]You can thank that Vortigaunt.
[183:32.06]He got me back here in one piece.
[183:33.70]Russ?
[183:34.44]Russell, put Dad on.
[183:35.96]Dad?
[183:36.66]Alex!
[183:37.30]Barry!
[183:37.92]Dad!
[183:38.96]We just took down a substation.
[183:40.97]Good.
[183:42.13]Because when they move this thing, that weapon's gone.
[183:45.63]We need to get it tonight.
[183:47.09]We will.
[183:48.13]You've still got that datapod, right?
[183:49.95]I do.
[183:50.67]Russ, this thing's biocoded.
[183:52.53]I'm gonna need the TLI.
[183:54.40]Why did I take so much damage?
[184:32.32]Just in case he was alive, just in case he'd come back and try to kill me.
[184:36.12]Where do I go?
[184:42.68]Yes.
[184:54.18]How we doing?
[184:59.51]How long have I been streaming for?
[185:01.94]Three hours, holy shit.
[185:04.28]I haven't come out of this once in three hours.
[185:11.60]Arms race.
[185:21.14]Pissed his pants.
[185:23.96]Alright, anybody?
[185:24.82]Let me ask you this.
[185:25.54]How far am I into Half-Life Alyx now?
[185:29.57]At this point, right here.
[185:31.28]What would you say?
[185:38.12]Like the halfway point?
[185:40.70]Okay.
[185:45.41]Probably like 60%.
[185:48.71]60?
[185:48.87]70%?
[185:48.93]At over half?
[185:50.23]Okay.
[185:53.11]Alright, it looks like we're right on schedule then.
[185:55.39]We'll play this for a little while longer and then we'll finish it tomorrow.
[185:59.14]Probably right on schedule.
[186:01.26]I thought I had 50 resin or something.
[186:05.60]18 resin.
[186:21.63]This guy's annoying.
[186:24.29]Get off comms, man.
[186:37.73]Alright, can I upgrade this at all?
[186:40.19]I like this gun a lot.
[186:43.21]Reflex Sight?
[186:43.81]Laser Sight?
[186:48.35]Turn on Push to Talk, dude.
[186:50.03]I can do Reflex Sight, but I don't know, that kind of sucks.
[186:54.03]I think it's worth doing.
[186:57.88]I'm not going to spend anything.
[187:02.84]You can get Extended Bag, that's exactly... Only Extended Bag, only.
[187:26.34]Not again, huh?
[187:32.53]I heard that guy.
[187:33.53]Where is he?
[187:39.17]Push to bring up jump.
[187:40.25]I know.
[187:40.43]I know how to jump.
[187:46.83]Hey.
[187:56.71]It's blocked?
[187:58.78]Oh, fuck off.
[187:59.46]Do I go down here?
[188:05.11]Is that gonna kill me if I fall?
[188:23.78]I gotta go down.
[188:26.20]Hey, does this kill me?
[188:27.02]It'll kill me if I fall, isn't it?
[188:37.71]Okay, so what do I do?
[188:41.67]Enter something I missed?
[188:43.13]I can do this.
[188:45.33]Why can't I look over here?
[188:46.75]I suppose with the cutout.
[188:50.03]That's cool.
[188:59.33]Almost fucked it up.
[189:08.60]With pipes.
[189:09.28]I know.
[189:11.88]The guy said I was gonna die.
[189:37.75]Okay, we need to power that.
[189:38.77]Is that the co- no it's not.
[189:43.27]I thought it was the core.
[189:45.47]Bullshit.
[189:55.84]What on Earth is that?
[190:13.74]Oh, it's you!
[190:14.42]It's you!
[190:18.42]Come on.
[190:22.32]Apparently I got Darth Vader over here.
[190:28.35]Oh, he was shooting at the aliens.
[190:29.31]Okay.
[190:38.65]I'm getting a little sweaty.
[190:42.72]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[190:45.40]Time for the first break.
[190:48.08]Break number one.
[190:53.46]Oh.
[190:55.22]Woo!
[191:00.85]Oh, yeah.
[191:02.67]Oh, what it feels like to be a human.
[191:06.85]Declan's break.
[191:17.13]Oh, the hair?
[191:17.71]It's actually not horrible.
[191:20.45]Headband really caused so many problems.
[191:23.45]Skipped a bunch?
[191:24.15]You weren't supposed to fall down.
[191:25.51]Wait, what?
[191:27.19]You skipped a lot.
[191:28.19]Reload the save.
[191:28.85]You missed stuff.
[191:30.19]You skipped a whole sequence.
[191:32.23]You skipped 25 minutes of content?
[191:37.05]What?
[191:38.81]Hold on.
[191:39.61]Let me just get some water.
[191:40.69]I'll be right back.
[195:52.00]Dude, I don't think he's ever coming back.
[195:57.99]I think he just was down there chugging water.
[196:02.13]Slamming water.
[196:03.13]Base station error.
[196:06.87]There may be something blocking the line of sight between your base station and the... Wait, what?
[196:10.21]Why is it saying that?
[196:16.78]The mic peaked?
[196:25.04]Remember, we could hear you regurgitate.
[196:27.70]Why am I puking into the toilet?
[196:30.69]Okay.
[196:32.71]Go back in.
[196:33.45]Oh, this is getting... Let me untangle the cord for a second.
[196:35.63]You have to do the thing where you have to hold the thing upside down and raise your hand as high as it goes.
[196:40.85]This cord is, like, fun out.
[196:50.41]Bad, huh?
[196:58.12]Who's so annoying?
[196:58.98]What?
[197:01.30]I'm annoying?
[197:01.80]You think I'm annoying you?
[197:06.00]What the hell are you doing here?
[197:10.99]He's so annoying.
[197:16.31]You're a stop reading chat.
[197:19.63]No, I want to be one of the best streamers on Twitch and that means you read everything.
[197:31.42]I'm getting that blue raspberry popsicle.
[197:34.86]Oh shit, that's gonna be ninja.
[197:36.66]He's got the blue hair.
[197:38.24]What color is my hair?
[197:41.00]What color is my hair?
[197:42.10]My hair is brown.
[197:42.80]That means I can have... It's like blonde.
[197:46.00]I have blonde hair.
[197:48.62]That's banana.
[197:49.92]The banana popsicle.
[197:57.13]Well...
[198:02.57]Let me update this video thingy.
[198:10.02]There we go.
[198:10.64]That's a little bright.
[198:15.50]What's that?
[198:18.54]What's that?
[198:25.74]Is that alright?
[198:30.17]How come this is, uh, the FPS is so bad on this?
[198:35.91]Bullshit.
[198:36.27]Alright, there we go, that's better.
[198:44.68]Fine, it's good.
[198:45.32]Okay, let's go.
[198:47.76]Uh, so I... Definitely gonna be playing this tomorrow, because I don't think I'll be able to do this for another, maybe, couple of hours.
[198:55.25]But we'll be finishing Half-Life Alyx tomorrow.
[199:02.51]Even if it's only, like, two or three hours left.
[199:11.80]End of stream voice.
[199:12.88]No, not yet.
[199:15.28]It's, like, six hours?
[199:20.37]No, I know there's at least, like, another probably seven hours left in the game.
[199:25.19]Six or something.
[199:28.19]Yeah, I know.
[199:30.39]Reload the last save.
[199:32.75]No, hold on.
[199:34.49]When are you doing Chubby Bunny?
[199:37.13]I have no idea, dude.
[199:38.39]Why is that like the most anticipated stream of 2020?
[199:46.12]It's the Chubby Bunny stream.
[199:55.61]Oh my god, I thought that was a monster.
[200:01.41]How's my health?
[200:03.19]All now.
[200:06.49]Why is that there?
[200:12.64]Why is this here?
[200:46.76]I don't know.
[201:19.59]What?
[201:19.83]Why late?
[201:20.25]What was that for?
[201:53.68]We were both shocked at what just happened.
[202:06.05]Fucking VR jokes.
[202:07.83]I've done those already.
[202:17.61]And we here at Five Guys, we got piles of bags of potatoes.
[202:21.73]That's how you know it's fucking fresh and real.
[202:24.31]We stack them up all over the restaurant.
[202:27.65]Just so you know that it's a real bag of fucking potatoes, unlike those other guys that use real potatoes.
[202:36.60]But we prove it, man.
[202:37.60]We got the bags all over the restaurant.
[202:48.61]Those are peanuts.
[202:58.40]Did I just, like, did I just totally, like, fake news everybody?
[203:03.50]I think I just did.
[203:05.85]Take some drugs and forget about that.
[203:11.29]Wait, those are peanuts?
[203:12.21]I thought they were potatoes.
[203:15.03]Well, okay, an even better question.
[203:16.89]Why the fuck do you have peanuts everywhere?
[203:25.64]Why do you have peanuts everywhere?
[203:26.68]If somebody has a peanut allergy, you're like putting land mines all over the place for them.
[203:30.94]Why are there bags of peanuts everywhere?
[203:46.71]Okay, his eyes turned red.
[203:48.37]He's dead.
[203:53.39]It's not safe.
[203:54.51]Keep peanuts lower.
[203:56.13]Chad is gaslighting you.
[203:57.39]Those are potatoes.
[203:58.95]Okay, thank you.
[204:00.79]Thank you.
[204:02.56]Thank you.
[204:03.78]Thank you.
[204:07.24]Thank you.
[204:08.46]Thank you.
[204:10.00]Thanks.
[204:12.02]Okay, there's no direct path from where you are to the vault, so you're going to have to snake your way there.
[204:17.40]Well, it's huge, so it shouldn't be hard to know which way I'm going.
[204:22.01]Hey!
[204:22.11]They already won the war.
[204:54.84]Boy!
[204:57.45]Okay, so I'm gonna set up, boy.
[204:58.75]Oh, they made them stronger.
[205:01.57]Okay.
[205:25.94]I'm so glad that there's no like big event coming up here in the next few weeks.
[205:30.52]I'm so glad TwitchCon isn't next weekend or something.
[205:34.63]I would have radiation burn marks on my face and zits all over my forehead.
[205:38.95]It would be like, Jesus.
[205:46.78]And like the top part of my hair is gone.
[206:01.21]Dude, it's like... Let me do this little mission.
[206:05.60]I just pulled a muscle in my arm.

[206:46.90]Oh, shit.
[207:16.36]Yep.
[207:23.88]For a grenade.
[207:24.70]Could have been better, but whatever, I'll take the resin then.
[207:29.39]Yep.
[207:29.63]Nothing here.
[207:33.97]Ooh, we ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days.

[209:52.59]Don't let him- ow!
[210:34.84]Where'd he go?
[210:43.59]Why am I doing that?
[210:54.88]Why am I doing that?
[211:12.03]I wish you could actually use these.
[211:31.08]I have an itchy face in the part where I cannot scratch it.
[211:42.32]Oh man, thank god.
[211:47.95]Okay.
[211:48.65]Better!
[211:48.91]Did it check?
[211:52.09]I already know I have a bunch on my face right now.
[211:54.51]I don't need to do a check.
[212:17.49]Under the Five Guys' bags?
[212:22.94]I guess.
[212:30.95]I knew.
[212:31.65]I told you one of them was going to be alive at some point.
[212:33.89]I knew it.
[212:55.48]Hello?
[212:57.18]Hi, honey, it's Mom.
[212:58.98]We're coming to see your place.
[213:00.76]Oh, right now?
[213:02.28]Like, now?
[213:03.38]Yeah, yeah, we're on the road there.
[213:04.50]We'll be there in five minutes.
[213:06.32]Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
[213:07.32]Okay, see you soon, Mom.
[213:08.30]I love you.
[213:08.68]My fucking wrist.
[213:27.21]Ow.
[213:29.34]Old man wrists.
[213:30.24]I smashed it.
[213:55.13]Trying to be fucking sneaky.
[213:56.07]It doesn't do anything apparently.
[214:11.68]I'm running out of pistol ammo.
[214:17.79]Lock it.
[214:18.67]Lock it up.
[214:23.28]Alright.
[214:23.64]There has to be a reason for why I could come back here.
[214:25.60]Of course there is.
[214:26.82]I can climb.
[214:28.34]I can climb.
[214:30.26]Climb.
[214:31.10]Of course I can.
[214:32.38]Climb.
[214:43.53]Thank you, chap, for the education.
[214:44.71]Fuck that one guy and he knows who he is.
[214:47.33]Okay.
[214:48.55]Whoever you are, I guess.
[215:06.58]This is like a big battle zone, so I'm a little weary about going out here.
[215:10.16]How are we doing on ammo?
[215:11.90]Everything good?
[215:13.00]Everything's good.
[215:18.89]How are we doing on... Anybody aim like this?
[215:21.29]I feel like this is more secure.
[215:24.61]Right against the hip.
[215:51.35]That's really close!
[216:05.05]My eye!
[216:06.03]My eye!
[216:11.29]My eyes!
[216:12.69]It just peeled my eyelids back!
[216:16.01]It pulled my eyelids off!
[216:25.31]No!
[216:25.77]Oh, no!
[216:27.43]Alex?
[216:27.65]Alex, you still there?
[216:29.43]No.
[216:35.13]Ow.
[216:36.60]That shit just... My eyes were open, and it took my eyelashes and eyelids and just, like, pulled them backwards.
[216:52.79]Don't die in the game where you die in real life.
[216:57.42]First the hair, now the eyes.
[217:01.64]Reload the 25 minutes you skipped.
[217:05.12]I thought you think it's a little too late for that?
[217:06.52]I think it's a little too late to go back, like, 40 minutes to go get the two resins I missed.
[217:28.02]Load it up.
[217:32.84]Load it up.
[217:43.21]Activating Jex mode.
[217:45.01]Jex mode engaged.
[217:47.43]Check this shit out.
[217:53.30]Was it... Isn't there ammo in there too?
[218:04.77]Where are they?
[218:44.05]Wasn't very good, wasn't very bad.
[218:49.41]I'll take a mediocre C+.
[218:50.67]What else we got?
[219:23.33]I gotta use- I love- a shotgun's my favorite weapon in any video game and I'm not using it ever.
[219:37.75]Good.
[219:39.25]Lock it.
[219:44.83]Here?
[219:56.34]I am gonna do it like this, actually.

[222:42.72]Don't you dare watch another streamer.
[222:47.06]Actually, I mean, Vinny's awesome.
[222:48.34]Vinny's very, very good.
[222:51.28]When Vinny's not live, you stay here.

[223:32.78]How about this?
[223:52.50]Fuck you, dude.
[223:54.15]I didn't even.

[224:39.50]What's that?
[224:42.68]What's that?

[225:31.37]Ready for part two?
[225:32.09]I don't think you are.
[225:34.81]I say you are, but I doubt it.
[225:39.93]Doubt it.
[225:40.29]Right next to you.
[226:16.33]What do you do?
[226:31.08]Finally stopped pretending.
[226:32.74]Well, you know, yeah, sometimes you gotta pretend.
[226:57.36]Somebody behind me?
[226:59.58]I need to fucking clean up a little bit here.
[227:05.87]Unplaced.
[227:06.51]Ten of ten.

[229:17.82]That counts?
[229:20.32]That actually counts.
[229:25.28]Right.
[229:28.05]I guess that makes sense, right?
[229:29.91]What?
[229:31.59]That's so little.
[229:48.05]Save the game, you just shit the bed.
[229:50.67]I'm right here.
[229:52.45]Can I get... How do I get... It was multi-tool.
[230:03.50]What?
[230:03.80]Are you serious?
[230:07.92]What do I have to do?
[230:42.06]I don't get it.
[230:47.25]Oh, it's Superman 64.
[230:47.97]Okay.
[230:48.23]I get it.
[231:12.79]And take them off the wall and rearm them.
[231:27.24]Same thing here, right?
[231:27.93]I mean, that takes a long time.
[231:29.75]Just throw a bucket at the fucking thing.
[231:31.09]You know what I mean?
[231:31.95]I don't want to do the puzzle.
[231:33.91]Just blow them up.
[231:46.62]Well, I do the puzzle.
[231:53.60]And you just blow up the room.
[231:55.06]You flinched.
[231:55.89]Yeah.
[231:56.33]What, do you want me not to flinch?
[231:57.69]It's scary.
[231:59.21]Okay.
[232:23.22]Um... No, no, no, no, no.
[232:27.42]Give me this back.
[232:43.63]Okay, that didn't work.
[232:44.61]That didn't work.
[232:50.97]I had a theory that maybe if I could close the door, I'd be fine.
[233:02.02]Try it again.
[233:02.53]They want you to do it.
[233:07.31]You gotta do it quicker.
[233:08.03]This guy's shitty.
[233:10.23]Let's watch Vinny.

[235:48.45]Yep.

[236:31.23]That's how I'm gonna shot the barrel.
[236:32.42]That's right, boom.
[237:04.41]I thought it was going to hit and explode.
[237:06.60]There's double resin over there, boys.
[237:41.66]Anybody know how to juggle?
[237:44.11]I don't.

[238:05.18]That's a dangerous game.
[238:06.60]That's a dangerous game.
[238:09.46]That's a dangerous game.
[238:13.55]Alright, cyanide or a shitty room?
[238:38.85]Oh, it exploded.
[238:46.65]Wasn't I already here at the beginning of the game?
[238:48.25]I swear to God, I was already here.
[238:57.31]Something in that car.
[238:58.40]Alright, just be careful.
[239:03.64]What is it?
[239:05.92]What is it?

[239:15.87]We're out into the open.
[239:17.09]How wet are my underarms?
[239:19.73]It's probably a joke.
[239:20.21]Right in.
[239:20.45]Uh, okay.
[239:27.29]Protector is going to be your right-hand person.
[239:34.34]Stay on.

[244:11.95]I gotta move to that storage unit.
[244:16.33]Done.
[244:43.00]I can't, I don't know, I'm gonna smash into a thing in my room.
[244:52.56]This stupid thing.
[245:13.24]You can open, open up.
[245:15.46]Good, let's go.
[245:26.93]What the fuck?
[245:28.47]Alex?
[245:34.49]Alex?
[245:48.29]At full health, I unloaded like 30 rounds of that fucking guy.
[245:52.59]Get close and use the shotgun.
[246:03.34]The guy is unloading a Gatling gun into me.
[246:06.81]And I can only go like two miles per hour.
[246:10.53]No, I don't.
[246:11.19]I can go much faster than that.
[246:13.39]I just have to do the dumb Diablo II charge move.
[246:18.87]Okay, I figured it out.
[246:24.89]Go, Jesus.
[246:43.52]Teleport around the whole fucking valley.
[246:44.74]Alright, I'm ready.
[246:45.52]I'm done with this bullshit.
[246:46.66]They're all dead.
[246:58.32]What?
[247:08.61]Oh shit!
[247:11.61]What?
[247:12.49]I got him!
[247:13.41]I got that motherfucker, he's dead!
[247:20.43]I told you!
[247:21.55]That's why I was so concerned!
[247:23.99]That's why I didn't want to throw it that hard!
[247:27.35]That's such a coward way to play this
[247:58.67]I feel like when you go paintballing for the first time, and you're terrified of getting hit, so you just kind of go like this to make it look like you're participating.
[248:11.20]You just stay down here, and yes, I was one of the guys that wore the fucking big vest so it didn't hurt when it hit you.
[248:41.26]We're good.
[248:42.04]We are good.
[248:42.38]We're good.
[248:42.68]We're good.
[248:42.98]We're good.
[248:43.26]We're good.
[248:43.54]We're good.
[248:43.78]We're good.
[248:46.37]We can take a shortcut through that building.
[248:48.61]Okay.
[248:49.43]I don't see a way into this building.
[248:51.51]I'm going to look around.
[248:52.81]We have a problem.
[248:53.77]What is this place, anyway?
[248:54.73]We've got a real problem.
[248:56.40]This is a big problem.
[248:57.86]This controller's broken.
[248:59.28]Is vodka good?
[249:00.76]Oh, no.
[249:01.08]Oh, God, no.
[249:02.74]Russell doesn't like vodka.
[249:04.38]Got it.
[249:05.42]I gotta push really, really hard.
[249:07.00]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[249:08.68]Okay, the plastic's coming off.
[249:11.35]Oh shit, hold on.
[249:35.88]Is that better?
[249:36.26]It's not great.
[249:38.98]It's not great.
[249:41.68]It's not great, but it'll do.
[249:46.16]Not great, but it'll do.
[249:47.02]I don't even know what happened.
[249:53.50]Oh boy, that sucks.
[249:59.77]Okay, left on the trackpad is Donzo.
[250:12.47]I'm actually surprised it took this long.
[250:35.44]Like, wouldn't you have figured that was going to happen, like, six months ago or, like, a year ago when I first started doing VR?
[250:39.61]How long has it been this long?
[250:52.82]Come on.
[250:54.66]I don't know.
[250:55.12]I need a power source here.
[250:56.16]Cool.
[250:56.26]Alright, we need power.
[250:59.00]Power!
[251:21.10]That sound.
[251:31.61]He's dead up here.
[251:32.27]Nothing else but soap and shit.
[251:34.85]Nothing else.
[251:40.55]Good.
[251:40.75]Alright, the power's over here, but hold on.
[251:44.66]There's a fight stick in there.
[251:45.66]I gotta see what it does.
[251:49.56]Force field.
[252:08.61]It's a baby toy.
[252:09.51]How much resin do I have?
[252:20.36]I've got enough to do the upgrade.
[252:39.93]Oh.
[252:55.60]Oh, nice.
[252:57.86]Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[253:04.40]Hell yeah.
[253:12.52]That door's open, I don't know what that's for, but it's open.
[253:21.75]Don't break shit.
[253:31.73]It worked.
[253:32.03]Does that mean I can go in here now?
[253:43.48]I have a grenade.
[253:55.56]Oh, nice.
[253:56.74]Alright, here we go.
[253:58.06]This is where I gotta put the power in here.
[254:07.41]I don't care.
[254:15.47]Here's the sound.
[254:17.67]The little Mario chomp guys.
[254:22.18]You know those little black things that go...
[254:39.93]Oh jeez, what do I eat?
[254:41.83]Alright, what do I eat?
[254:43.39]I don't know what to get today.
[254:47.41]I got food.
[254:49.11]Okay, back!
[255:08.09]It looks as if there are Combine barricades up ahead.
[255:30.45]They're stopping anyone from getting any closer to the vault.
[255:33.06]Okay.
[255:33.30]So, what do you think?
[255:35.76]Make your way into the distillery and see where it takes you.
[255:38.32]Distillery!
[255:38.78]With my tribe back online, we've finally got the Alkmaar!
[255:40.50]No, you're kidding me!
[255:42.28]Oh my god, I have all these things!
[255:55.61]Shit, shit, shit!
[255:58.37]Shit!
[256:01.05]Shit!
[256:04.91]Shit.
[256:07.37]Shit.
[256:09.43]Holy shit.
[256:12.09]Oh.
[256:13.53]Oh no.
[256:14.23]No, no, no, don't come in.
[256:24.07]Why do you have a shield that can block everything?
[256:25.83]It's not fair.
[256:46.16]Stop it!
[256:46.74]Oh my fuck!
[256:52.24]Oh my god, where's my healer?
[256:54.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[256:59.62]What's this?
[257:01.19]Blast out.
[257:02.03]Where is he?
[257:05.01]Where is he?
[257:06.41]Oh, fuck!
[257:08.53]Oh, fuck!
[257:18.08]Holy fuck!
[257:47.15]Shut up already!
[257:47.99]Okay.
[258:01.85]I've got a whole lot of ammo.
[258:08.76]Where's the power cell?
[258:09.98]There it is.
[258:14.12]Okay.
[258:17.13]Now, I gotta plug this thing in.
[258:19.51]Where do I plug it in?
[258:20.45]Nice to plug this in.
[258:24.72]In here, isn't it?
[258:25.44]Where is it?
[258:27.78]I actually don't remember.
[258:33.42]Where's that power cell thing?
[258:35.44]Down here.
[258:35.76]I thought that was a bad guy.
[258:49.74]Oh, I need this.
[258:52.14]Let's go.
[258:52.54]Give it to me.
[258:54.24]Do the whole thing.
[258:57.33]Oh, it feels so good.
[259:10.90]oh no no no no
[259:40.34]One... left.
[259:41.73]One?
[260:10.88]That's fun.
[260:32.55]Uh, I don't have any bullets.
[260:34.35]In almost any gun.
[260:38.53]I'm kind of a deep shit.
[261:00.67]He's looking for ammo.
[261:07.45]No ammo?
[261:07.99]I'm not jumping from here.
[261:15.50]Are you nuts?
[261:16.08]How do you climb back down a ladder?
[261:22.80]Oh.
[261:28.36]Are you crazy?
[261:33.86]Gonna do whatever the hell this is.
[261:48.53]Power?
[261:50.69]How?
[261:50.95]Didn't I turn it on?
[262:03.55]awesome oh it's powering this thing
[262:58.98]right here.
[263:36.76]37, extended mag, let's go.
[263:42.94]Hi to Eduardo.
[263:43.52]Hey Eduardo.
[263:44.16]Hi, welcome to the stream.
[264:08.44]Oh, ammo?
[264:09.28]Yeah, but I'll find ammo.
[264:10.62]It looks like I'm not going to see ammo ever again.
[264:16.46]You can put that to good use.
[264:19.56]Sick.
[264:20.57]Out of cells.
[264:23.01]Oh, don't do that.
[264:26.61]Last medicine.
[264:28.05]Well, I'm in a lot of trouble then, huh?
[264:33.57]I need to take that cell and put it...
[264:43.60]Got a cell somewhere else.
[264:46.34]My power's this thing.
[264:54.92]Red cable, okay?
[264:56.22]The red cable goes...
[265:10.39]Fuck, I can't watch this.
[265:11.23]I'm at the exact same spot in the game.
[265:13.79]Not fun, man.
[265:15.11]It's a good game.
[265:16.09]I wish you the best of luck in your video game adventure.
[265:19.43]What's this red cord?
[265:30.25]Up the box.
[265:31.13]I can't.
[265:34.68]Hold on, let me go over here for a second.
[265:41.03]Where's this cord?
[265:41.95]There's a red cable.
[265:45.21]Do I have to plug something in?
[265:49.47]Lift this up and go up there.
[265:57.52]Get all this shit out of the way.
[266:01.80]Oh, and under here.
[266:21.50]That's why I watched the bar.
[266:23.50]Shoot it, please.
[266:25.30]It doesn't do anything!
[266:28.12]I just shot a shotgun in there, guys, okay?
[266:30.70]I can't... Bingo.
[266:39.22]Alright, so how do I get this power on?
[266:48.79]How do I turn this on?
[267:04.91]multi-tool, multi-tool.
[267:11.60]It doesn't do anything.
[267:18.72]In the upgrade room, is it?
[267:39.37]That's a red cable!
[267:40.71]Not going at anything.
[267:44.43]Ding ding!
[268:14.14]Ding ding?
[268:22.49]Ding.
[268:34.05]What the hell did that do?
[268:44.64]That was it.
[268:50.52]At the console.
[268:53.17]Wait, what?
[269:04.70]Ding, ding.
[269:05.22]Ding, ding.
[269:06.64]Did I ding, ding it?
[269:25.60]I... I... The flapper boys.
[269:27.62]Oh my god, it's at the shield door thingy.
[269:30.48]What?
[269:30.78]No, it's not.
[269:33.90]He's donation baiting.
[269:35.54]No, I just like... Where the fuck is this?
[269:41.91]The power to the red cable is like... I need to go here to there, but the power connected- but then where the fuck does the power go?
[269:51.83]Is it po... Oh, no.
[269:54.51]Like, just stop.
[269:54.81]Dumb, dumb, dumb.
[269:55.13]Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
[270:15.00]Okay. Switch the stupid power.
[270:34.04]He did it!
[270:34.58]Hooray!
[270:35.44]Alright, I'll move this shit.
[270:38.32]What happened?
[270:39.32]That's the monitor.
[270:39.96]Monitor's going back.
[271:09.36]Alex?
[271:17.22]Alex, you still there?
[271:41.58]Guys, how far back is that?
[271:43.08]Please don't tell me that's that far back.
[271:44.90]That's not that far back, right?
[271:47.13]It's gonna be after the fight.
[271:48.31]Please be after the fight.
[271:49.17]Please be after the fight.
[271:49.99]Please be after the fight.
[271:51.35]Please be after the fight.
[271:52.17]Don't have to load up and there's like 10 people after the fight.
[271:55.47]Please be after the fight.
[271:56.33]Like when I turn the power on.
[272:09.57]Thank God.
[272:10.05]I think we can hear the clappers.
[272:16.96]Okay, thank God.
[272:18.58]Thank God, thank God, thank God.
[272:22.20]It's not even extended back, but it's okay.
[272:24.52]Alright.
[272:28.70]I forget this one already.
[272:29.96]I already forget how this one works.
[273:03.69]Okay, get me in.
[273:09.02]VOD watcher is unskipped.
[273:11.10]You know what pisses me off more than anything?
[273:12.60]Is that was true.
[273:16.86]Like the VOD watcher should have just skipped 15 minutes.
[273:22.05]It's pissing me off because it's accurate.
[273:40.37]Hi, VOD watchers.
[273:41.91]We made it.
[273:44.16]You can put that to good use.
[273:49.06]I'll put that to good use.
[273:53.62]I'll put that to good use.
[274:17.63]I'm targeting this one.
[274:19.51]Video games aren't even any good anymore.
[274:21.67]They used to be better when they were eight pixels each.
[274:24.55]I remember when I played E.T.
[274:25.64]and it was better than this one game could be.
[274:28.98]Games are the best they've probably ever been, ever.
[274:31.58]Don't let anybody ever tell you that.
[274:32.75]Unless it's me and we're talking about the golden years of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or the Nintendo 64 Entertainment System.
[274:37.81]That was the golden age of no game as compared.
[274:40.14]And Bloodborne.
[275:06.31]Fog watchers.
[275:07.72]Fog watchers.
[275:11.20]Fog watchers.
[275:21.87]Fog watchers.
[275:24.78]Fog watchers.
[275:34.43]That's a good height.
[275:41.19]Ride that.
[275:47.16]I'll take it to the top, please.
[275:48.12]Thank you.
[275:56.60]I did it.
[275:56.96]I did it.
[275:58.77]We can keep going.
[275:59.51]We can move on.
[276:01.80]One bullet, seven bullets.
[276:03.04]I need the shotgun.
[276:05.82]The only damn thing I have that has any bullets in it.
[276:12.11]Gordon?
[276:12.55]Gordon Freeman?
[276:17.57]Yeah, that's me.
[276:25.92]Karma sucks at everything.
[276:26.96]I have
[276:35.89]It was too low.
[276:41.15]Thank you.
[276:48.96]Morning, Jeff.
[276:52.74]There's definitely a bunch of old bottles in here.
[276:55.04]Does alcohol go bad?
[276:57.00]It only improves.
[276:57.92]It's all good, Alex.
[277:00.03]Russell.
[277:06.51]I was gonna take off the lid, but whatever.
[277:15.54]A bunch of ooze.
[277:24.32]Oh, shit.
[277:26.38]It's the Mario things.
[277:29.97]Things I was talking about.
[277:30.91]This is them.
[277:41.54]Alright, settle down.
[277:50.28]They hungry?
[277:50.76]Should I like puke into their mouths?
[277:52.97]Alright, here you go baby birds.
[278:14.91]Oh.
[278:17.39]Looks like it sucks, okay.
[278:20.11]Completely covered in news.
[278:28.46]I'm out.
[278:43.52]Is this gonna hurt?
[278:45.00]Oh, it does.
[278:45.88]Thanks.
[278:47.42]Uh, how am I gonna get by this?
[278:59.76]Fuck.
[279:02.52]Insert three power cells?
[279:18.15]Like, all that shit.
[279:20.03]Drop it.
[279:22.51]I can open that, right?
[279:27.23]Here.
[279:48.12]Alright.
[279:49.70]I'm out.
[279:50.30]I mean, you're... Oh, fuck.
[279:51.62]That's alright.
[279:52.02]I didn't pick it up.
[279:53.80]This place is creepy.
[280:06.57]What am I supposed to be doing?
[280:11.65]Roz.
[280:23.10]Hi, everybody.
[280:23.70]I know I'm not purple.
[280:25.72]El, Sel, Sel.
[280:26.58]What?
[280:30.17]What's the matter?
[280:31.55]Why is everybody freaking out?
[280:33.51]What the fuck?
[280:37.61]Lee, love you.
[280:39.91]El, what's going on?
[280:44.98]How's everybody doing?
[280:45.56]This is beautiful.
[280:47.38]Alex, come in, Alex.
[280:49.12]Alex?
[280:50.47]Oh, there you are.
[280:51.05]There you are.
[280:51.51]Beautiful sunset.
[280:51.97]There's no straight shot to the vault.
[280:53.60]I'm gonna head inside and find a way out.
[281:03.60]Gorgeous.
[281:04.36]I love this.
[281:05.46]Beautiful.
[281:22.47]It's so pretty.
[281:30.23]Walking?
[281:30.53]Yes?
[281:30.67]Alex!
[281:31.21]You're never gonna believe... Ruz?
[281:58.28]I'm here, I don't know, I guess I might... Hey, you with the blood on you.
[282:08.93]You, with the blood.
[282:10.95]I got a little situation here.
[282:13.45]Yeah, you sure do.
[282:15.81]You don't happen to have a gun on you, do you?
[282:18.37]Got a gun?
[282:20.73]Yeah, look at that.
[282:22.23]It's a nice one, too.
[282:25.56]It's nicer than mine, which is up inside this guy.
[282:28.28]I saved you.
[282:32.06]Thanks.
[282:35.20]I alerted the horde.
[282:36.08]Sorry.
[282:36.22]What the hell was that?
[282:37.94]Oh, that's Jeff.
[282:39.08]Jeff?
[282:39.88]Don't worry.
[282:40.32]He can't see.
[282:42.00]Here's just fine, though.
[282:43.72]Got him here like Mozart.
[282:45.32]Who?
[282:45.52]Alright.
[282:47.29]Now let me help you out.
[282:48.99]Alright.
[282:49.79]See you on the other side.
[282:57.47]There's a character named Jeff.
[283:11.76]Where is he?
[283:17.95]Looks like an angry, hungry baby.
[283:25.68]We do!
[283:26.48]Why don't we get out of here?
[283:56.54]Oh, he's scary.
[283:58.78]Kinda scary.
[284:07.91]This is gonna be like the run from the scary monster part, right?
[284:12.79]Of course it is.
[284:15.94]Why wouldn't they put a scary one?
[284:28.75]Alright.
[284:31.33]I'm assuming I should probably take a few of these.
[284:33.41]Hey, Jeff!
[284:34.17]Where'd he go?
[284:34.93]Jeff?
[285:10.37]Hey, hey, those things are nasty.
[285:12.93]You gotta cover your mouth.
[285:14.09]Got it, thanks.
[285:15.46]Hey, I almost forgot, what's your name?
[285:17.12]Alex.
[285:17.80]Alex Vance.
[285:20.40]Hey, Alex, I'm Larry.
[285:21.82]Nice to meet you.
[285:22.56]Hi, Larry.
[285:23.00]Try not to get killed.
[285:29.85]Okay, I've got, wait.
[285:49.60]Give me this.
[285:51.96]Give me the resin.
[285:52.72]Give me the resin!
[286:01.29]Okay.
[286:05.15]I have no bullets.
[286:06.11]I guess bullets don't matter.
[286:11.10]Armed with noise.
[286:23.88]Is he right here?
[286:36.07]Alright.
[286:41.19]Oh, there's a thing.
[286:45.03]Fucking open it!
[286:47.92]Open your mouth!
[286:54.71]That's what I just told her!
[287:12.32]Oh, fuck.
[287:13.10]You see down here?
[287:15.48]My god.
[287:16.12]God.
[287:23.88]Oh, fuck.
[287:24.94]Where's... Oh, fuck.
[287:25.78]Put this shit in here.
[287:56.69]He can't, it's blocked, he can't get in here.
[288:01.52]I'm just gonna clean their locker.
[288:15.66]Okay, Jeff, I brought you a treat.
[288:47.53]It's over there.
[288:48.19]Go over here, man.
[288:49.19]Go over this way.
[288:56.71]Oh, he's stepping on the bottles.
[289:00.70]Ah!
[289:18.96]Open the window.
[289:19.78]Open the window.
[289:20.62]Open the window.
[289:21.36]Open the window.
[289:26.78]Open the window.
[289:31.41]Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[289:38.11]Fuck me.
[289:39.15]Fuck me.
[289:39.75]It's over there.
[289:40.29]Look.
[289:41.05]Look.
[289:41.23]It's over there.
[289:42.51]He can't get in here.
[289:43.41]He can't get in here.
[289:44.01]I'm saving him.
[289:48.98]I've been here.
[289:54.86]Fuck you!
[289:55.42]I'm trying to place it down!
[289:56.97]Well that just made him angry.
[290:04.01]Made him angry.
[290:31.72]Am I alive?
[290:35.76]Jeff, okay, I get it.
[290:40.25]I get it, I get it, I understand, I understand, I get it.
[290:42.85]I just gotta figure out, this is gonna suck.
[290:48.68]I gotta figure out a way to get around him.
[291:14.25]That's a great checkpoint by the way.
[291:16.16]Thanks for that.
[292:09.40]Good, okay, is he gonna come in here?
[292:17.36]Oh my god.
[292:18.60]Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!
[292:20.62]Stop!
[292:44.55]Does he leave eventually?
[292:45.60]Does he leave?
[293:10.03]Where am I?
[293:10.65]I grabbed something.
[293:11.31]I grabbed something.
[293:12.39]I grabbed something.
[293:13.15]I grabbed something.
[293:13.97]I grabbed something.
[293:24.54]Smashing my desk.
[293:25.68]I don't know what that was, but how the fuck am I going to do this?
[293:30.17]Hi.

[294:34.71]How do I get rid of you?
[294:42.62]Oh, shit!
[295:03.86]It was worth a shot.
[295:04.84]It was worth a shot.
[295:05.58]Just to try once.
[295:06.58]Just to see if I could, like, Mr. X him and he would, like, fall down on his knee.
[295:12.00]The theory was, like, I shoot him in, like, the face when it opens up and he, like, goes down on one knee for one, two, three, four.
[295:19.65]I'm alive and I'm gonna get ya.
[295:21.13]I don't know.
[295:26.77]Hey, thank you.

[305:10.31]We'll just take our time here.
[305:15.26]It doesn't matter.
[305:15.80]He can't get out.
[305:16.36]Okay.

[309:11.56]Alright, so now he's gonna be right here.
[309:16.21]Other hand, other hand.
[309:34.71]Oh, what the fuck happened?

[309:45.12]What's he doing?
[309:48.72]What's wrong with him?
[310:16.66]You knew I was in there the whole time, dude.
[310:25.17]I just wanted to be in the camera.
[310:31.42]One night I was covering my mouth.
[310:37.62]That was the home stretch.
[310:40.54]I had my mouth covered.

[313:51.48]Treasures aren't worth it!
[313:58.99]What?!
[313:59.87]Okay, I don't even know where he is!
[314:21.25]Oh shit, I can go in there.
[314:27.49]Out of sounds.
[314:28.25]What on Earth is this?
[314:53.22]Look out, they're stabbing me!
[314:54.21]They're stabbing me, I think.
[315:10.81]Alex, coming in.
[315:11.39]Hey, Alex.
[315:12.17]Oh, there you are.
[315:13.19]Can you hear me?
[315:13.77]More or less.
[315:14.63]You're breaking up.
[315:16.00]I think you're still in the distillery.
[315:17.82]I made a friend named Jeff.
[315:19.56]Well, that's great.
[315:20.16]We can take all the help we can get.
[315:22.06]Yeah, we're not really close.
[315:24.12]Listen, there should be a big tunnel-sized plug in the floor there somewhere.
[315:27.19]That's gonna be... The tunnel out of here?
[315:28.89]Correct.
[315:29.91]You get it open, I'll figure out where it leads.
[315:37.29]Pre-power cells.
[315:38.29]That's going to be a blast, Jeff.
[315:40.38]You and me have all kinds of fun.
[316:14.62]Holy shit.
[316:22.26]I thought there was some big eyes bugging out at me.
[316:46.46]Ah, nice try.
[316:47.38]Power self?
[317:22.18]I got some stuff.
[317:46.84]One power cell, okay.
[317:49.20]Oh my god, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[317:57.63]He can hear this shit!
[317:59.39]Why did I just do that?
[318:00.37]Why did I just do that?
[318:34.80]I can't break!
[318:36.89]I didn't break twice!
[318:38.97]I didn't break twice!
[319:01.67]Power source, power source!
[319:03.01]Power, power, power, power!
[319:05.17]Don't touch that, that's a fuckin' bad play!
[319:18.46]Stop coughing!
[319:33.06]Quickly, quickly, over there!
[319:35.45]Go, go, go, go!
[320:16.46]I know who it is!
[321:38.63]How do I get this fucking thing open?
[321:45.95]Gas mask in here.
[321:54.89]Give me this thing, give it to me.
[321:56.69]Thank God.
[321:57.13]Is it on?
[321:59.91]Gas mask on?
[322:13.16]How do I get this to open?
[322:14.04]How do I get this to open?
[322:16.28]Oh my god, I know what to do!
[322:20.42]I need a bottle right now, right now, right now!
[322:22.58]Oh my god, that works!
[322:23.41]Dude, that works.
[322:23.89]That's okay, that works.
[322:27.21]What happened?
[322:28.49]These are... Shit!
[322:33.85]I'll be taking that, thank you very much.
[322:35.47]Okay, we gotta get the fuck out of here.
[322:36.79]Give me that bottle, I'll throw it over there.
[322:38.08]That would be great.
[322:38.70]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[322:39.68]Don't cough, don't cough, don't cough, don't cough, don't cough.
[322:49.62]Fuck you!
[322:50.14]What did I hit?
[322:50.80]I don't know.
[323:07.42]Oh shit!
[323:08.00]I'm not gonna be in here.
[323:24.47]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[323:35.44]Lighter.
[323:36.26]Two of these fucking things, man.
[323:41.50]I got two.
[323:42.60]I got two.
[323:43.10]Look at you, Jeff.
[323:50.76]Nicely done.
[323:58.35]I need three.
[323:59.44]Where's the third one?
[324:07.00]There's a third one down there.
[324:09.26]One more.
[324:09.58]One more.
[324:10.30]Alright.
[324:11.68]Do I get a save point here?
[324:16.91]I do, right?
[324:20.91]I better get a save point here.
[324:23.39]Annual save?
[324:23.93]I don't know how to do that.
[324:32.31]That was hell.
[324:34.96]That was the most terrifying thing ever.
[324:45.30]Okay, where was that last guy?
[324:48.56]Last guy was not, I got the one in here.
[324:53.21]I did.
[324:55.21]Got the one in there.
[324:57.31]Got the one right there.
[324:59.31]That's only one there, okay.
[325:03.52]The other one.
[325:22.49]Oh, that way.
[325:28.53]Yo!
[325:34.18]Oh!
[325:34.52]Oh!

[326:50.82]I'm done.
[326:51.24]I'll pick it up tomorrow.
[326:52.54]This is fucking killing me.
[326:54.21]This is insanity.
[326:56.41]Oh, yeah.
[326:57.05]Let's go.
[326:57.75]I'm so glad to be over with this.
[327:04.57]And there we go.
[327:06.63]Oh, man.
[327:08.30]Hi, Jeff.
[327:09.68]It was a lot of fun, but you are terrifying.
[327:26.21]Turn it on.
[327:29.57]What the hell was that?
[327:32.89]Oh, you... What the hell was that?
[327:43.24]That's Jack.
[327:44.00]Keep your voice down.
[327:45.58]Oh, okay.

[329:21.17]In the Trash Capacitor!
[329:21.94]Trash Capacitor!
[329:22.62]Trash Capacitor!
[329:44.44]Holy shit, that was, that was wild.
[330:00.60]Now he doesn't stand up.
[330:04.52]Oh my god, Jeff are you okay?
[330:12.79]That wasn't funny.
[330:19.85]He's dead.
[330:23.13]Holy shit, thank god it's over.
[330:25.85]Oh my god, it's over.
[330:26.89]It's over.
[330:28.49]I killed him, that was intense.
[330:36.14]Insanity.
[330:37.43]Alright, and that's... That's the end of the stream.
[331:08.11]Go.
[331:08.35]Let's go.
[331:16.88]Engage.
[331:32.97]Great also little heads up.
[331:35.34]I think the tunnel is full of antlions Just in case I cut out permanently and lines and lines and lines
[331:43.06]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[331:44.71]There's antlions in this game.
[331:46.75]Those things are horrifying.
[331:47.85]Alright.
[331:48.01]Tunnels.
[331:49.75]We will pick up tomorrow with the tunnels.
[331:51.61]Into like a... after change?
[332:15.92]Get a chapter change?
[332:16.86]Yes, we are.
[332:19.32]Alright, guys.
[332:25.66]It's nuts.
[332:32.84]This is where it gets chill?
[332:36.26]Uh, when I hear screaming ant lines, I don't think chill.
[332:44.39]We'll pick it up tomorrow.
[332:46.73]And then I'm assuming that we'll finish it tomorrow.
[332:52.13]Death and chill.
[332:55.55]Alright, so from here, how many hours are left in the game mood today?
[333:06.30]Three?
[333:07.14]Three-ish?
[333:07.56]Three to four?
[333:07.96]Yeah, that's perfect.
[333:10.96]We're around four, three, four, three, four.
[333:12.76]Alright, yeah.
[333:13.34]That's perfect.
[333:13.78]We'll just finish it tomorrow.
[333:17.98]You'll beat it tomorrow?
[333:18.70]Alright, cool.
[333:20.79]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[333:22.19]Thanks for watching.
[333:22.79]I believe we have it saved, but before I turn off my computer, I'll make sure it's saved.
[333:25.89]Let's do a hair check.
[333:28.37]Oh, man.
[333:28.87]I feel... This is only the second time I've come out of the headset.
[333:34.31]It's not good, but it's okay.
[333:35.38]I'm grateful for a normal human.
[333:43.56]Doing another hair treatment tonight, man.
[333:47.80]Oh.
[333:50.48]Uh, my assessment of Half-Life Alyx so far is it's, uh... It's pretty solid.
[333:56.04]It's pretty solid.
[333:58.29]I'm a big fan.
[333:59.77]Oh, and wow.
[334:02.13]Uh, actual... Actual perfect timing.
[334:05.91]Because this thing just ran out of battery.
[334:08.89]This is the one that broke, though, so I don't know if that's... Is that a bad sign?
[334:12.38]Is that low battery or is that a bad sign?
[334:13.82]Perfect timing.
[334:17.65]Alright, let's do the subs.
[334:19.37]Let's chill for a minute.
[334:20.65]And then I'm going to get some food and I'm going to relax and lie down.
[334:24.35]Take a bath.
[334:25.45]Do a hair treatment.
[334:29.76]Thanks again, everybody, for watching.
[334:32.38]And thanks to all the subs.
[334:36.68]Appreciate it.
[334:39.36]There were... I'm going to go through some of them, actually.
[334:41.78]Five community subs from InkCat.
[334:44.45]Five for Marlon Brando.
[334:45.86]Marlon Brandio.
[334:48.26]And then we got the five and five from Colonel Dingleberry and Jaspi.
[334:55.18]I love it so far.
[334:57.46]Typically, you can't see yourself sitting in a VR game for more than three hours.
[335:02.56]But it flows together very well.
[335:04.65]The Jeff sequence.
[335:07.33]You know when something seems so horrible and so terrifying that, oh no, I can never do it?
[335:12.75]It wasn't that bad considering.
[335:14.25]It was just scary.
[335:18.33]So, Valve definitely decided they were going to make... If you think of every VR game you've ever played... It's the look out, here comes the scary monster.
[335:28.71]Right?
[335:29.91]And it's coming to get you!
[335:32.37]In the headset!
[335:34.84]Hey, how about a shooter where you gotta shoot headshot and duck, duck, use cover?
[335:39.78]Hey, we've got like weird little puzzles where you got to look through the wall with a little device.
[335:44.86]They kind of just took every VR game that was an hour long and made it a 12 hour long game.
[335:51.18]So, I think it's pretty good.
[336:01.07]I'm very surprised that it's this long.
[336:02.73]You know, when they first announced this, I really thought this was going to be some kind of demo.
[336:10.88]the index was coming out, and I thought this was gonna... Oh, look!
[336:13.72]Half-Life Alyx!
[336:15.80]It's like an hour and a half, and it's just kind of fun, and you play around with Alyx Vance, and that's it.
[336:21.92]I did not know that it was gonna be a full experience like this.
[336:24.71]So it's very, very good.
[336:28.29]We will finish it tomorrow.
[336:31.57]It's a full AAA game.
[336:32.65]Oh, yeah.
[336:33.07]It absolutely is.
[336:33.75]And I don't wanna give you a rating, because I don't wanna blow it.
[336:38.34]But... I mean...
[336:41.59]It's up there.
[336:47.77]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[336:49.35]We're going to start 2 p.m.
[336:50.77]Pacific tomorrow.
[336:51.57]2 o'clock Pacific.
[336:58.96]Thanks for watching.
[337:03.44]Get some sleep.
[337:04.02]Get some food.
[337:04.58]Get some rest.
[337:06.96]I'm going to get up right now and I'm going to leave.
[337:11.22]Hold on, let me turn that off, whatever that is.
[337:16.11]ChodeStreamer.
[337:19.38]Good night, guys.
[337:19.92]I'll see you tomorrow.
[337:21.44]Have a great night.
[337:42.11]Thank you.
