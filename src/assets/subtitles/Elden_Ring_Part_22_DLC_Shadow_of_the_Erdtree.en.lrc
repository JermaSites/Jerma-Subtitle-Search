[ve:60.16.100]

[00:20.17]What's going on?
[00:23.07]Well, I'm not doing an intro, by the way.
[00:24.79]I'm ready.
[00:27.07]I've been sitting here for about 20 to 30 minutes blasting this song in my ears and just smashing Gatorades.
[00:35.97]I've been ready since 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:46.78]My updates going so slow.
[00:49.38]Yeah, thankfully I got it real quick.
[00:55.96]Yeah, I've been waiting a long time for this.
[01:02.30]I got my hydration here.
[01:04.78]I'm fed.
[01:08.82]We're going to set some ground rules.
[01:11.62]Because I'm going to set them.
[01:14.04]Ground rule number one for Elden Ring DLC night.
[01:23.17]Rule number one.
[01:25.97]I'll sing it.
[01:27.07]I'll take my time.
[01:33.08]Back seating is allowed.
[01:36.72]But guess what?
[01:39.28]None of you fuckers have played the game.
[01:45.48]So it's the best time to play Elden Ring.
[01:49.74]I'm going.
[01:50.16]Let's go.
[01:54.96]Alright.
[01:55.18]Ground rule number one.
[01:55.98]I'm going to take my time.
[01:57.14]I've been waiting for this for a long time.
[01:59.08]Ground rule number two.
[02:00.42]See rule number one.
[02:01.94]Ground rule number three.
[02:02.92]I don't give a shit about... I'm just going to win, right?
[02:06.37]So like if I'm having a tough time, maybe I'll use the summons.
[02:08.85]Maybe I won't.
[02:09.47]Who gives a shit?
[02:11.77]There you go.
[02:12.03]You got your one singing of the year.
[02:15.92]Oh, and by the way, I know I'm going to free, I'm just going to get this out of the way because I'm going to freak people out with this.
[02:20.75]And I know like there's like a joke that every time we see him, he's a different guy.
[02:24.21]So let's go ahead and just like lean into that because like I have glasses now and I look like I'm fucking 50.
[02:28.77]So yeah, because it happens when you get old.
[02:33.99]I need glasses to see the game.
[02:35.71]Okay.
[02:36.92]I need glasses to see the game.
[02:44.49]Alright, are we okay now?
[02:45.73]Are we good?
[02:48.39]Oh, shit, I fucking crashed.
[02:51.49]Oh, no.
[02:54.57]Wait, did my game crash?
[02:58.88]Somebody's calling me Crackhead Philosopher?
[03:01.88]Get out of here.
[03:02.66]Oh, did I make that up?
[03:11.71]Alright, I'm not going to have the cam on just yet.
[03:16.09]There's going to be a bunch of cut scenes.
[03:17.79]I want to pay attention.
[03:18.77]Holly and I have become lore masters over these last couple of weeks.
[03:26.14]I'm very, I'm going to be, guys, I'm going to be reading item descriptions.
[03:30.42]You get that?
[03:31.70]Get it through your head.
[03:33.66]By the way, if I want to go to the beach and just look around for 10 minutes, that's what I'm going to do.
[03:40.31]I'm in no rush.
[03:41.65]I'm just going to play.
[03:46.31]Alright.
[03:46.69]I think my camera just broke.
[03:49.65]Per usual.
[03:51.83]Somebody told me how to fix this and it was a specific one thing to do and I just didn't do it.
[03:57.04]Alright.
[04:01.40]Hi, there we are.
[04:01.88]Okay.
[04:03.82]Alright.
[04:04.12]Are you ready?
[04:04.80]I'm ready.
[04:05.16]No more.
[04:05.64]Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[04:06.86]I'm ready.
[04:07.22]I'm ready.
[04:07.54]The sound's on.
[04:08.70]Audio's on.
[04:09.18]Things sound good.
[04:09.76]I'm so excited.
[04:10.44]Can you tell?
[04:13.03]The Ring of Miquella?
[04:15.49]I got it already?
[04:20.59]Okay.
[04:21.05]I'm parked right here, by the way.
[04:25.77]The Ring of Miquella.
[04:27.09]I think it's an emote.
[04:28.51]Alright.
[04:28.75]Cool.
[04:31.73]Alright, there's somebody here.
[04:34.07]I'll give you a quick TL;DR if you don't know.
[04:36.02]That's supposed to... Who you... If you're watching the stream, you know what happened.
[04:40.60]Okay, let's go.
[04:41.38]Ready?
[04:42.14]Oh my god, I'm so ready.
[04:43.66]Who's this?
[04:44.24]Who the fuck are you?
[04:45.62]It's Miquella.
[04:46.68]Ah.
[04:47.66]Were you guided here by kindly Mikula?
[04:50.63]I am Leda.
[04:52.31]And like you, I was guided by faith along his honorable path.
[04:57.35]Touch the withered arm, and you too will be transported to the realm of shadow where Mikula the Kind now dwells.
[05:05.80]My compatriots are there already.
[05:07.98]Like us, they have heard kindly Mikula's call.
[05:12.20]If you can find them, they are certain to lend you aid.
[05:18.45]Okay.
[05:19.49]Anything else?
[05:23.44]Just start R1-ing?
[05:29.60]I can't do that, guys.
[05:30.94]I'm sorry.
[05:32.28]You don't look forward to a DLC for over a year and then R1 five times to the first NPC.
[05:37.76]That's not happening.
[05:38.64]Not right now.
[05:40.08]Okay.
[05:40.28]Here we go.
[05:48.01]I look fucking sick.
[05:51.63]Head to the realm of shadow.
[06:13.43]I'm so sorry, but I had to do that.
[06:15.68]I've been trying to get that out for like the last hour.
[06:17.22]Alright.
[06:19.32]So just a quick recap of what this character is.
[06:22.52]This is an Int.
[06:24.52]This is an Int.
[06:25.62]Dex kind of, I mean, it's mostly Int.
[06:28.16]But Cold Sorceries, that's the Ronnie's Moon.
[06:32.41]The Ice Sword.
[06:34.57]The Ice Glintstone.
[06:36.95]I also have Gravity Magic too, which I didn't realize how powerful it was because I got this.
[06:41.48]This is the, uh, gravity, what is it called?
[06:44.10]Uh, meteorite staff, which boost gravity sorceries.
[06:47.70]As long as I have it in one of my hands, I'm good.
[06:50.98]I do still have the baby rattle.
[06:55.06]Where am I, where am I on the map?
[06:56.28]That's a good question.
[07:00.46]You know how awesome it feels that, for the first time in like a year, not knowing what the fuck that is?
[07:12.55]Alright, I'll turn the cam on now.
[07:14.92]Temporarily.
[07:15.46]Uh, yeah, it's gonna be awesome experiencing things for the first time.
[07:25.44]Let's go for it.
[07:32.58]Here we go.
[07:32.84]Alright.
[07:34.94]Make sure the hair is good.
[07:37.68]Not in my face.
[07:39.40]Alright, let's fucking go.
[07:41.20]Wait!
[07:45.89]Look around.
[07:46.45]Uh, I don't- you don't think I was prepared for this?
[07:49.69]I got 99 of these stones.
[07:54.11]I'm gonna be placing shit, I'm gonna be- look at all- I got all my bars set up.
[07:59.28]Bombo is plus 10, we got the boys at plus 9.
[08:01.42]Why is this fucking thing even crashing?
[08:08.50]Dude, this webcam sucks.
[08:11.66]Can I- can it stay on for 10 fucking seconds?
[08:15.69]What the fuck are you doing?
[08:16.71]Okay, here we go.
[08:19.51]Uh, Mambo is my snake summon, if you didn't know.
[08:31.42]Oh, damn.
[08:37.24]Gravesight Plane?
[08:39.08]Hold on.
[08:40.94]Did ray tracing turn on?
[08:43.48]Am I crazy?
[08:45.32]What's going on?
[08:47.34]I'm getting some FPS sluggishness.
[08:53.07]Why is that?
[08:56.01]Alright, that's better.
[08:57.49]Can't run maximum.
[08:59.61]Dude, I don't fucking understand this camera.
[09:01.83]I have no idea why it's doing this.
[09:04.57]I don't get it.
[09:06.86]Hey, that one person that knew how to fix this webcam problem, what the fuck do I do?
[09:13.46]I just don't get it.
[09:17.57]We don't even need it.
[09:18.39]Alright, can one of the mods, or Holly maybe, track down that person that gave me the fix?
[09:25.85]This webcam was expensive, by the way.
[09:28.67]This was not cheap.
[09:32.77]This looks fucking awesome, by the way.
[09:38.86]I still have Torrent, right?
[09:40.24]I do.
[09:41.02]Whoa, look at that.
[09:42.28]Okay.
[09:46.24]Is that like the tree setting all over there?
[09:47.70]Alright, let's touch this.
[09:57.53]Do I get to talk to anybody?
[09:58.29]I don't think so.
[10:00.97]Yes, okay, Shadow Realm Blessing.
[10:04.59]Level up.
[10:06.09]I'm level 156.
[10:07.01]I heard that somewhere around 120 over 150.
[10:08.49]150 is like the sweet spot.
[10:13.83]shadow skadoo tree blessing skadoo tree blessing and revered spirit ash blessing I know why that glitch is happening because you copied the webcam element into another scene you have to make two separate webcam elements so it doesn't freak out
[10:41.47]Okay, hold on.
[10:42.07]Wait.
[10:43.07]I don't think I have that, though.
[10:48.81]This is not like a reference cam.
[10:52.89]This is like a new source.
[10:59.92]Yeah, I'll get it on in a little bit.
[11:02.04]When I take my first break, I'll try to get that figured out.
[11:09.06]So there's a new leveling system, apparently.
[11:11.30]I'm just going to go this way.
[11:14.72]Yeah, it's not just runes.
[11:18.45]I think runes still exist, but not to the extent that they're important in the base game.
[11:23.89]Alright, where am I going here?
[11:25.67]I'm going to go... Oh, that's the map.
[11:27.01]So it's right here, apparently.
[11:28.51]They don't waste any time giving it to you.
[11:39.67]It's like shadow people?
[11:40.65]Okay.
[11:56.96]Gravesight Plane.
[12:03.12]Oh, whoa.
[12:03.74]It is a new area.
[12:07.41]Okay, so...
[12:10.51]I'm going to go right here.
[12:11.09]I'm going to go to five and then, um, hold on.
[12:14.77]I need to, I got to breathe.
[12:20.73]I think I'm going to go here first.
[12:25.30]Wait, what is that?
[12:27.42]We're doing that first.
[12:28.16]Alright, let's plan this out.
[12:31.86]I'm going to go to three because that looks cool.
[12:33.73]Whatever that is.
[12:34.19]I don't know.
[12:34.45]It's a structure.
[12:46.72]I wonder, is it behind or was it wait?
[12:48.12]Wait, is that where I came from?
[12:52.12]OK, this is where I came from.
[12:53.34]We're going to mark that as a. Yeah, OK, I was I was already there.
[12:57.34]But technically I can I go up there?
[13:02.12]Hold on a sec.
[13:06.12]I wonder if I can wrap around.
[13:13.98]Well, what is that?
[13:19.78]Holy shit, this is so high up into the air.
[13:22.30]Okay, so I'm very high in the sky.
[13:34.36]I almost just fell off.
[13:37.80]He's already overwhelmed.
[13:39.22]I know, I know.
[13:40.46]I don't know what to do first.
[13:42.30]When you wait so long for something and it's finally there, you kind of don't know what to do with it.
[13:45.68]It's like, uh, uh, uh, yeah, of course I'll, uh...
[13:51.10]Go this way.
[13:53.37]Jesus Christ!
[14:06.67]Okay, a lot of gravestones too.
[14:08.05]I wonder if there's new materials.
[14:29.97]You know what's funny about the webcam thing, too?
[14:32.56]I was sitting here with the stream just on.
[14:34.26]Just not live, but like OBS open.
[14:37.32]And the cam was just on.
[14:38.76]Didn't pause one time in like an hour.
[14:42.98]What the fuck does that even mean, dude?
[14:44.62]Okay, what about to the side?
[14:52.12]Go here.
[15:00.40]A lot of these Fire Giant things.
[15:09.10]You just sat there looking at yourself in the camera.
[15:11.01]No, I was getting ready.
[15:11.91]I was preparing a Gatorade.
[15:16.67]That sounded weird.
[15:18.05]I put Gatorade into a bottle and put ice in it and then added a straw.
[15:21.87]That's not really preparing it.
[15:22.95]It's putting it into a different container.
[15:29.54]What?
[15:29.94]That's really high up.
[15:31.22]Wait, can I even get up there?
[15:32.44]I guess we're going this way.
[15:35.37]Does anybody know how to unclog a toilet without a plunger?
[15:42.92]There's way more important things going on right now, dude.
[15:45.18]I'm sorry.
[16:00.81]Alright, this guy looks kind of scary.
[16:15.03]What the fuck?
[16:24.85]Ow.
[16:26.25]That took a lot of health.
[16:30.61]That's a cool shield too.
[16:33.87]Remember this move?
[16:41.48]Black Steel Great Hammer.
[16:45.30]You know what I'm doing.
[16:47.29]Gotta read that shit.
[16:53.82]Weapon of the Black Knights, servants of Messmer, the Impaler.
[16:57.72]Great hammer of black steel with decorative embellishments in gold.
[17:01.37]Plus, with an Erdtree incantation, further holy imbuement will amplify the effect and greatly increase the armament's power.
[17:08.87]Guard counters cause a burst of power.
[17:12.60]Assume an anchored stance to work as an endure.
[17:14.56]That's kind of crazy.
[17:15.60]I want to test something real quick.
[17:32.59]Is my computer not good enough to run the game at 4K?
[17:34.65]I feel like it's running kind of slow.
[17:53.12]I got a 3090, which you would imagine would be able to handle it.
[17:57.80]There was not a difference when I just did that, so I'm going to go back to this.
[18:04.06]Yeah, RTX is off.
[18:05.10]I turned it off already.
[18:08.10]Alright, Smithing Stone.
[18:08.94]Smithing Stone 5?
[18:11.80]Skadoo Tree Fragments can be found across the Realm of Shadow.
[18:14.88]Consume these at Sights of Grace to bolster your Skadoo Tree Blessing.
[18:19.60]The Skadoo Tree Blessing bolsters the recipient's abilities to deal and negate damage, but has no influence outside the Realm of Shadow.
[18:25.98]Interesting.
[18:34.60]I already have two of them.
[18:37.28]Okay, a splinter of the skadoo tree.
[18:40.72]So that thing is called the skadoo tree?
[18:44.91]That contains golden brilliance.
[18:46.75]Acquired of the Church of Marika and other places in the Realm of Shadow.
[18:50.35]Consume these at Sights of Grace.
[18:51.45]Yep, skadoo tree blessing.
[18:53.73]It is said that when the skadoo tree crumbles from its core, that it will scatter across the entire Realm of Shadow.
[19:00.08]The people of the Ur tree collect the splinters and use them in prayer.
[19:13.84]Cool.
[19:14.78]Church of Consolation.
[19:15.86]Anything else here?
[19:23.03]We got shit happening over here.
[19:33.88]The Skadoo Tree!
[19:43.41]Guy alive?
[19:44.03]Yeah.
[19:50.36]This may have been a bad idea.
[19:52.10]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[19:54.90]Give me that.
[19:57.60]Fire coil.
[19:59.78]What am I doing in here?
[20:01.40]Don't get off the horse.
[20:02.30]What are you stupid?
[20:06.50]Oh shit, I'm going to die in here.
[20:10.36]No, please.
[20:15.63]Why did I go in here?
[20:16.81]And why did I not just walk out the fucking door?
[20:28.72]Oh, the Statue of America is down here.
[20:30.72]Let me try one more thing with the camera.
[20:40.12]What if I do this?
[20:49.88]Yeah, this thing just really doesn't even want to work.
[20:53.04]At all.
[20:54.88]It was working fine.
[20:57.22]I can't even get it to stay on for more than one second.
[21:08.49]Go to device manager, imaging devices, right click, webcam, hit disable, right click.
[21:12.01]Yeah, I did that already.
[21:15.29]Let's try one more time and I'm really not going to do it until after I get back from the break.
[21:26.15]uh-oh that wasn't a good sound alright everybody everybody pray that it stays on I don't get it actually wait I might actually get it hold on alright well I died this first death
[21:52.45]Yeah, I wish I could tell you what was going on.
[21:54.85]It just, yeah, it won't even stand for one second.
[22:00.20]Okay.
[22:00.88]Well, I guess I could plug the other one in.
[22:16.15]It's so funny, like, when you want to test stuff on a livestream, you have to be live to test it.
[22:22.28]Like, oh, hey, like this thing doesn't work.
[22:24.17]Why?
[22:24.55]Well, you have to be live to whoever is subscribed to you to troubleshoot it.
[22:30.55]Oh, fuck, I thought my computer crashed.
[22:35.15]Alright, give me... Do I really care about ruins right now?
[22:37.73]I don't think so.
[22:38.35]Alright, I get it.
[22:45.88]Did I get everything here?
[23:05.70]OK.
[23:10.64]There's a whole nother area over here to the right.
[23:14.46]I got everything prepared.
[23:15.12]I think didn't die.
[23:19.34]Messmer Soldier's Axe.
[23:20.42]I want to see it.
[23:38.65]Stream frozen for you.
[23:40.90]I think it should be on.
[23:42.00]Not for me.
[23:47.00]Okay.
[23:48.71]I'm going to mark this because I was already... I did it.
[23:52.82]My marking system is the sword means I did it.
[23:54.68]I wonder if I can get in here somewhere.
[23:57.96]Alright, what do you think?
[24:00.90]Can I go up the waterfall?
[24:01.62]Huge entrance.
[24:17.97]Wait, what if it's an illusory wall?
[24:28.16]Yeah, I did it.
[24:29.00]I did that.
[24:30.44]Let's go.
[24:31.12]Let me go look around here.
[24:32.74]I want to go look around like the trees.
[24:40.46]Are you doing a magic build with the sleeper face?
[24:43.26]Um.
[24:45.21]I would say it's 50 like 40% magic.
[24:49.39]I do a lot of swinging.
[24:50.55]It's a lot of like actual attacking.
[24:52.76]I would say it's like 40% magic use like 60% swinging.
[24:58.46]Because I do like melee a lot.
[25:06.43]What's this?
[25:26.57]It's so pretty though.
[25:29.02]Everything looks so beautiful.
[25:30.06]Everything just looks like fall.
[25:31.38]It's like Altus Plateau.
[25:32.28]Look at the leaves are changing.
[25:39.02]Oh great, this is where like the boatload of fucking tourists come in.
[25:45.19]It's not really accurate.
[25:46.07]There's not a jammed up highway with 5,000 cars on it.
[25:58.78]Imagine you have to ride by a bunch of fucking sedans.
[26:03.20]Just lining this right side here.
[26:04.74]That looks like a point of interest.
[26:11.41]Dude, you just killed a family?
[26:12.85]No, I didn't.
[26:14.95]These are shadow of the Earth tree enemies.
[26:21.23]Uh-oh.
[26:21.89]That guy just fucked me up.
[26:29.09]Rada fruit, not resin.
[26:33.77]I want to look at that axe I got.
[26:34.83]Dex strength.
[26:45.52]Favor to those who lost themselves utterly in their lord's war.
[26:49.92]Powerful charge attacks.
[26:52.32]I like this music too.
[26:53.21]It's really great.
[27:01.92]Alright, from here, let's plot out a plan.
[27:04.72]Got that.
[27:09.01]This looks cool.
[27:09.69]Do I just go right down the fucking main road?
[27:11.83]Should I just go right down Main Street?
[27:15.09]Yeah.
[27:16.05]Yeah, let's go.
[27:16.63]Let's go right down Main Street.
[27:23.17]What do you have to say?
[27:27.68]Everyone, burn to sinners.
[27:30.62]Burn away.
[27:32.62]Scorched ruins.
[28:07.73]Wait a minute.
[28:10.95]No, never mind.
[28:11.65]I was going to say, what is he talking about?
[28:13.21]Up here.
[28:22.89]These guys are going to activate and then start attacking me.
[28:25.13]I bet you.
[28:26.17]Hefty cracked pot.
[28:29.57]They're all going to activate.
[28:30.31]They're all going to attack me at the same time.
[28:32.45]Watch.
[28:57.39]What do you got?
[28:58.47]Greater potentates cookbook.
[29:05.12]Ah, that's right.
[29:05.76]This is a new feature.
[29:06.54]So you can activate in your menu now.
[29:10.80]Uh, to see new items that you picked up recently.
[29:13.70]That is a huge deal.
[29:16.68]Okay, um, there it is.
[29:21.89]Hefty five, so you can, wait, hold on a second.
[29:29.73]Are these huge?
[29:31.23]I think these are the huge ones.
[29:36.30]The ones you hold over your head?
[29:39.28]That's so cool.
[29:40.82]I was talking.
[29:41.98]What else we got?
[29:54.85]Check this out.
[29:56.19]Nevermind.
[30:06.78]Roots.
[30:08.62]This thing is interesting.
[30:09.52]I want to go look at this.
[30:10.98]This thing's going to come alive.
[30:11.84]You're not going to come alive, right?
[30:20.89]I swear to God if this thing wakes up.
[30:26.74]Looks cool though.
[30:33.60]Crazy.
[30:33.80]Crazy.
[30:38.26]Plus 10 baby rattle?
[30:39.26]It is a plus 10 baby rattle.
[30:40.52]You are right.
[30:41.12]Can I go up this?
[30:56.97]Shadow dog.
[31:02.67]There's no entrance.
[31:04.49]Where even am I?
[31:05.26]Okay, I'm over here.
[31:15.44]you have do you have bells on your shoes it's this item it's the baby rattle yeah the baby rattle makes a like I have a bunch of change in my pocket sound
[31:44.76]Back into the middle.
[31:46.18]Did I go this way?
[31:47.70]Did I go all the way around?
[31:53.85]This looks like I can go up here.
[31:55.25]Maybe not.
[32:08.13]Oh, I can get up there.
[32:09.16]I definitely can.
[32:10.00]There's no way I can't.
[32:19.71]I'm over here.
[32:26.76]Shit.
[32:29.86]Are you going to stream your Dark Souls Clippies?
[32:33.99]Uh, yeah.
[32:35.81]I still want to do that.
[32:36.41]Alright, time to ditch Torrent for a minute here.
[32:51.59]Black Pyrefly?
[32:52.72]Are those bosses or are they just enemies?
[33:00.16]I thought I was dead.
[33:10.84]Make the big pot now.
[33:14.62]I can't.
[33:17.14]I need some more mushrooms.
[33:32.63]Get me up there.
[33:36.65]Oh god, I just love jumping puzzles.
[33:42.89]Is that guy doing it too?
[33:52.23]Maybe no torrent.
[33:53.47]I'm gonna think no torrent.
[33:54.85]Watch this.
[33:57.98]What the fuck?
[34:01.00]They can jump really, really high.
[34:02.64]Really?
[34:02.96]Come on.
[34:07.05]Dude, he hates this DLC.
[34:10.65]I just opened it 10 minutes ago.
[34:12.43]What?
[34:19.40]There's got to be a way up there.
[34:20.42]There has to be.
[34:29.95]Why would they put the drape there?
[34:33.06]Is it just bait?
[34:35.94]Or is it really specific?
[34:41.60]There we go.
[34:42.00]Got it.
[34:42.22]There's a lot of shit up on this roof.
[34:56.64]Hold on.
[35:06.78]I am mesmerized.
[35:10.04]It must be because of Messmer.
[35:20.47]Ah, first item of the DLC is Blade of Mercy.
[35:27.69]Oh, what is that?
[35:28.33]Talisman?
[35:37.83]Raises attack power after each critical hit.
[35:42.99]Like, permanently?
[35:43.71]Until you die?
[35:45.45]Or rest?
[35:47.22]I wonder how that works.
[35:47.98]I employed this to honorably end the suffering of a compatriot.
[35:55.10]After claiming numerous lives, the dagger is now broken, but has acquired a spectral aura.
[35:58.86]I think it raises your beer.
[36:01.80]What the fuck are you talking about?
[36:08.52]Oh, it's been like 15 minutes.
[36:09.84]Time to check and see if we can get the webcam turned on.
[36:21.82]What's up?
[36:23.21]I'll give it 10 seconds.
[36:24.33]There it goes.
[36:33.15]Give OBS more cores in the task manager.
[36:38.41]Oh, what if I do this?
[36:41.10]I got an idea.
[36:42.18]Bear with me for one second.
[36:43.72]Trust me, this is going to work.
[36:44.84]I'll be right back in 30 seconds.
[37:08.70]Bye.
[38:03.62]Alright, hey, listen to me.
[38:05.22]I promise I'll be back in literally one minute.
[38:08.20]I just have to restart the stream and we'll be fixed.
[38:11.17]And I'll get the cam and we can fucking go all night.
[38:14.27]Alright?
[38:14.47]I'll be right back.
[38:16.23]60 seconds.
[38:16.63]Count.
[38:16.95]You can count.
[38:17.63]I promise you.
[38:31.10]Hey, what up?
[38:34.32]I fixed it.
[38:38.08]Fixed it.
[38:43.38]Hey, we just started the stream.
[38:44.61]See?
[38:44.73]You think we have a Roblox character?
[38:53.39]No, I don't.
[38:57.93]Imagine arguing that.
[39:07.50]Imagine getting in an argument with somebody about the fact that you look like a Roblox character or not.
[39:12.02]What the fuck is going on?
[39:17.45]Alright.
[39:17.83]Hello.
[39:18.49]I'm here.
[39:19.21]I'm back and I'm excited and I'm ready to play Elden Ring's downloadable content, Shadow of the Erdtree.
[39:26.94]Alright.
[39:27.14]We good?
[39:27.96]Everybody good?
[39:28.78]Everybody still here?
[39:29.78]Hanging out?
[39:30.96]Let's move.
[39:32.70]Alright, I got that thing.
[39:33.50]I'm not going to use it.
[39:34.20]I am a magic int dexterity character, but we're going to keep going this way.
[39:45.61]It's running a little better now that the sun's not out.
[39:47.69]I wonder if other people are having that.
[39:50.53]When that sun was out, it was like, holy shit, everything was beautiful, but it was running at like 50 FPS, 40 FPS.
[40:06.06]Dude, you can break the pots in the DLC.
[40:09.46]This is new.
[40:09.96]It used to just be crates.
[40:17.97]It's frustrating that's why like a third of you guys are here.
[40:20.71]To see me do that.
[40:21.51]Alright, I think I got everything.
[40:32.36]No, I did not.
[40:36.22]Just wait for the opportunity where I can use Mambo and we're going to get lit.
[40:39.54]It's getting foggy.
[40:54.85]It's getting... Oh, no wonder my FPS went up like 100%.
[40:57.29]I got a great fog wall to help increase it.
[41:05.78]That's cool.
[41:06.14]Alright.
[41:06.74]I don't want to miss anything.
[41:12.41]I hope there's nothing on that roof.
[41:16.37]Zero render distance.
[41:19.05]I think that's everything in there.
[41:20.33]That was cool.
[41:21.53]What is that thing?
[41:22.75]Alright.
[41:25.67]We're going to go over here.
[41:26.43]This area.
[41:28.29]Yep.
[41:29.81]And make sure to mark the wall too.
[41:36.49]I wonder if we're going to see.
[41:39.79]Hold on.
[41:47.09]Holy shit, it's like an ostrich.
[41:54.09]I gotta get off the horse for this.
[41:57.23]God.
[42:06.69]help me see what's going on here you idiot I killed your friend too okay that was a cool enemy alright let's head over here holy dude you're just autocon but give me some autocon lines
[42:37.28]Snake, uh, my, um... I, I, uh... Snake, watch out!
[42:44.69]Don't go over to that... This ration's over there.
[42:47.45]I haven't played that game in like 15 years.
[42:49.49]I have no idea.
[42:50.31]I don't even know what I just said.
[43:02.43]Did I even say words?
[43:04.47]Uh-oh, there's more than one.
[43:12.98]What was that?
[43:47.65]A bird, dragon, griffin, something?
[43:51.05]Oh, these things, I can attack these.
[43:53.75]Should I?
[43:54.13]I feel like they're not hostile.
[43:59.21]Oh, the little arms.
[44:02.57]Why do you need glasses?
[44:03.73]Talk to me when you're 40 and you tell me if you need them.
[44:06.59]If you need them at 40, you tell me.
[44:07.79]Because you probably will.
[44:16.31]Uh...
[44:19.67]Okay, so they're angry now.
[44:21.17]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[44:24.73]Okay, well, I didn't kill it, so it's okay.
[44:27.33]Is that a boss door?
[44:35.64]Uh-oh.
[44:38.30]Western Nameless Mausoleum.
[44:47.26]Fuck it, let's do it.
[44:51.52]Black Bull Knight?
[44:59.32]Nice fucking aim.
[45:04.34]Dude, you belong in Call of Duty.
[45:09.38]Alright, don't talk shit.
[45:13.90]Don't talk shit.
[45:18.95]Oh my god!
[45:20.05]That just did almost 100% of my health!
[45:21.45]Oh my goodness!
[46:04.40]Don't do that again.
[46:38.63]Whoa, he shoots again?
[46:39.63]Uh-oh.
[46:50.32]It's too hard.
[46:50.82]I quit.
[46:51.36]I'm not doing it.
[46:51.90]I quit.
[46:57.91]You suck at the game.
[47:03.00]I can't say that this early.
[47:07.98]My scanners are saying... Does Otacon even say that?
[47:12.10]Does Otacon talk about scanners?
[47:23.75]I can do it.
[47:24.25]I didn't even use any magic either.
[47:26.45]I did that with no magic and you know what?
[47:29.02]Felt pretty good.
[47:29.68]I think I'm going to do it right now.
[47:31.12]Press B to dodge roll.
[47:32.48]Thanks for the tip.
[47:41.14]Oh my god, that guy fucking annihilated me.
[47:44.53]Alright, so here's the tip.
[47:46.43]Tip is, we're going to try again.
[47:50.49]You lost your souls?
[47:51.35]I don't really think they matter in the DLC.
[47:58.40]I got him down to like 50%.
[47:59.14]I can do it.
[48:02.10]Don't roll into the arrows.
[48:03.16]You gotta just run.
[48:09.25]Also, let me... You know what?
[48:10.15]Let's fuck around a little here.
[48:11.73]I'm gonna play games.
[48:14.15]I can play games.
[48:17.51]I can open up where the beers are at the convenience store and fuck you up.
[48:35.34]Come into my magical freezing dust!
[48:41.37]Yeah!
[48:47.77]Alright, so that's a long wind-up.
[48:54.49]And then it's boom.
[48:55.53]Okay, so it's a big... Oh my goodness!
[49:08.52]I'm gonna take some mana potions off, I think.
[49:21.20]Eat gravity!
[50:10.83]Wee!
[50:13.23]I'm sorry.
[50:25.25]Whoa, that was a different move.
[50:26.23]That was a different move.
[50:26.79]He just did a different move.
[50:42.96]Oh.
[50:53.41]He jumps?
[50:54.45]Alright.
[50:55.01]He's at 50%.
[50:55.33]I can do it.
[51:03.49]Oh my god.
[51:04.39]I'm so sorry.
[51:04.95]I just punched you.
[51:08.45]Why did that?
[51:08.91]What the fuck is wrong with the mic?
[51:14.15]Bro just got mesmerized?
[51:15.31]Yeah.
[51:16.15]It's my own fault.
[51:18.87]Alright, I got... No, I can do it in 10.
[51:22.87]I can do it in 10.
[51:24.91]I can do it in 10.
[51:25.29]How come you're using the baby rattle?
[51:33.37]If a cool int weapon drops, I'll definitely try to use it.
[51:36.83]Are you flexing your biceps?
[51:41.81]That was... That threw me off.
[51:42.51]Hold on.
[51:42.67]Hold on.
[51:55.83]He's so deadly.
[52:28.69]That's a good one.
[53:15.23]I got timid there.
[53:50.97]What the fuck?! !
[54:23.48]Go shoot it.
[54:24.20]Shoot it!
[54:27.11]What are you doing?
[54:30.29]Go fucking around and fight me!
[55:06.07]What just happened?
[55:23.84]Oh, he's caught up to me!
[55:25.14]He caught up to me!
[55:26.00]He caught up to me!
[55:36.05]OH, GET FUCKING DESTROYED!
[55:37.95]Don't get cocky.
[56:17.24]Okay, I... If I had four more flasks, I would have beat him.
[56:30.84]I got, I got, I got, I got him.
[56:32.50]I got him.
[56:32.84]I had him.
[56:41.50]Why are you wearing safety glasses in case of debris?
[56:45.42]There could be some shrapnel.
[56:46.94]Wait a minute.
[56:48.72]Oh, I have one of these.
[56:51.50]Consume skidoo tree fragments to bolster your... Oh, well, that would be wonderful right now.
[56:59.16]Use one skidoo tree to empower.
[57:04.87]Okay, that would have helped, probably.
[57:08.81]Now it's two skidoo tree fragments.
[57:10.71]Okay.
[57:13.97]Consume...
[57:15.58]Spirit Ash to bolster your Revered Spirit Ash blessing.
[57:18.74]Bolsters both Summon Spirit's and Spectral Steed's abilities to deal and negate damage.
[57:26.11]So this is a way to increase your summons?
[57:29.29]This is to make Mambo better and make Torrent better?
[57:31.17]Alright, well I just made myself stronger.
[57:33.67]Let me give myself more flasks.
[57:37.87]That's a fun fight though.
[57:38.83]It's just so scary because he's so dangerous.
[57:42.85]And sometimes he does this shit.
[57:43.93]He goes... He takes out the crossbow and then he puts it away.
[57:46.43]Then he takes it out and he puts it away.
[57:47.55]It's like, dude.
[57:49.86]You get hit with one of those bolts, you're dead.
[57:53.72]Oh, goodness.
[57:54.70]Okay.
[57:57.60]Flasks.
[57:59.32]Yeah, you... Let's... We're going all... All in here.
[58:02.84]I got him this time, no doubt.
[58:05.13]No doubt about it.
[58:05.91]If I had an extra two or three flasks right there, he's dead.
[58:08.91]100%.
[58:08.95]And you all know it.
[58:28.81]Did you hear that?
[58:29.19]It sounded like something was kind of marching behind me.
[58:39.24]Oh, it's you.
[58:39.88]Okay, whatever.
[58:40.42]Dude, they got right to the point with this place.
[58:46.60]Just like, hey, here's some asshole with a machine gun.
[58:52.78]I like it, though.
[58:53.32]Alright, this is cool.
[58:54.72]This guy is gonna... Now that I'm buffed up and I have extra heals... Watch this shit.
[59:01.02]I could use magic, but no.
[59:02.20]Fuck it.
[59:02.52]I'm... I'm... I'm in a... I'm in a... I'm in a brawlin' mood right now.
[59:07.89]Let's go.
[59:08.25]Alright, this is the one right here.
[59:09.81]I got my skidoo tree blessing.
[59:11.07]Go ahead and do what you wanna do.
[59:30.53]Wanted to jump.
[59:33.85]I... Okay.
[59:36.85]I... I rested the controller on my lap and it pressed L2.
[59:43.16]The PS5 controller went L2.
[59:49.80]I was locked in.
[59:50.74]I just couldn't... I rested the controller down and I pressed L2.
[59:54.76]Remember this.
[60:01.52]Everyone, like, you didn't know anything and you say everything was fucking hard.
[60:07.80]Guys, I honestly, I think this is connected to America.
[60:25.08]He just beat me.
[60:35.29]The range on the baby rattle is one Pinocchio nose length.
[60:41.19]It's like this long, the range on this thing.
[60:45.43]It's like if Pinocchio lied three times, that's how far the range is on this weapon.
[60:54.37]I'll get him.
[60:57.33]Stop using it?
[60:58.32]But it's shiny.
[61:06.48]yeah let's go yes yes uh my flask of wondrous physique it is the heal when you go down to 20 health and also stamina recovery speed alright lock in lock in lock it no more around
[61:50.60]alright I gotta figure that out because that hurts a lot and it's hard to dodge it
[62:23.85]Silence, magic user, you must... You've made your bed, you must lay in it.
[62:33.72]I go to bed every night and... I put my staff next to me.
[62:36.90]And I put my rings... You know, I was thinking about streaming today, and I was thinking about having just a bunch of huge jewels on my hands.
[62:44.80]Just big-ass rings.
[62:48.17]just like big emeralds and stuff I don't know I just thought it'd be funny this guy hits really hard alright okay walk in alright you're not even here you're not even here
[63:58.68]Shit!
[63:58.82]I thought he was going to swing once.
[64:27.81]Is he gonna drink?
[64:33.01]Smash him!
[64:54.00]Quit fucking faking out!
[65:39.01]You can't get him out of the air.
[65:42.59]Shit.
[65:43.07]I thought I was going to stagger him out of the air.
[65:46.06]I thought I was going to stagger him out of the air.
[65:50.46]I thought when he jumped up, I was going to hit him and he was going to go.
[65:53.74]Oh, what a miscalculation.
[65:58.10]What a miscalculation.
[66:03.02]He does 10 times your damage.
[66:08.02]I thought I was gonna just get him right in the gut.
[66:13.80]Alright.
[66:15.00]It's time to pull out the ice.
[66:16.35]Time to pull out the ice crag.
[66:17.81]Oh, hello there!
[66:21.81]It's me, a magician!
[66:42.92]Ha ha ha ha!
[67:28.04]You get to swing too many times in a row.
[67:29.40]That's not fair for the rest of us that play.
[68:08.18]Oh, I was far enough away from that bullshit.
[68:20.44]Don't you dare.
[68:21.15]God damn it.
[68:54.49]Oh, I had no stamina?
[69:09.50]Oh, fuck you!
[69:11.96]Put the fucking sword down!
[69:29.55]That is such bait by the way.
[70:02.47]Do I hear Otto?
[70:03.69]Otto, what are you doing?
[70:07.57]What are you doing?
[70:08.77]He's like jumping on me.
[70:10.83]Do you need something, dog?
[70:13.60]Daddy's in the middle of something right now.
[70:16.76]Daddy's working on something right now.
[70:18.66]Just in a few minutes.
[70:20.64]Daddy will come and do whatever you need me to do.
[70:25.80]Okay, hold on.
[70:26.95]Are you alright?
[70:29.57]He's like jumping on my leg.
[70:36.94]Oh my goodness gracious, I lost from the dog.
[70:39.84]He's probably thirsty.
[70:50.17]Take a drink, IRL?
[70:54.26]Oh, people think that was bullshit?
[70:59.02]No, you guys don't understand.
[71:01.28]My dog was like biting my leg.
[71:12.04]He's probably like, what the fuck?
[71:13.44]You know what's really funny?
[71:15.68]Dogs and cats probably think we're fucking insane.
[71:20.04]He's sitting there.
[71:21.46]I looked over, he ran over.
[71:24.64]Oh, it's dinner time.
[71:25.58]That's what it is.
[71:26.62]Yeah.
[71:27.69]It's time for him to get some food.
[71:29.99]They must think we're absolute nutcases.
[71:33.11]Like, we sit in front of these bright blocks that make wicked loud sounds at us.
[71:39.50]And we sit there and just stare at it.
[71:40.80]They're probably just like, what the fuck are they doing?
[71:43.07]What's wrong with these people?
[71:46.89]It's like there's just this bright thing, box that's sitting on the wall.
[71:51.35]And we just sit there while it blasts light and sound in the room.
[72:04.80]I wish you could see that because that was actually really cute.
[72:08.86]It was almost like he was encouraging me.
[72:10.21]He was like, come on, you can do it.
[72:11.83]Please.
[72:12.17]I'm like, oh my goodness.
[72:16.41]He went downstairs.
[72:18.95]He is eating.
[72:22.17]He's eating his delicious food.
[72:23.37]Alright, here we go.
[72:28.08]That one didn't call.
[72:28.74]That was dog aggro.
[72:30.40]That didn't count.
[72:44.31]actually kill me kill me kill me kill me I don't know how my hair is so sweaty already and I didn't even do anything like how could this much perspiration build up in in nine minutes I don't understand
[73:18.44]It's time.
[73:22.12]I am going to save my magic until the second phase after... Because that's technically a second phase, right?
[73:30.39]Kind of what it is.
[73:34.79]We're going to be here forever.
[73:36.09]I also feel like I'm here a little early because he's hitting me with his sword one time and it's taking off 70% of my entire health pool.
[73:45.72]Wow, it still hurt me.
[73:46.96]We're good.
[73:50.45]Alright.
[73:51.53]Hold on.
[74:12.31]I can feel the wrinkles on my scalp with all the positive energy I'm sending.
[74:15.99]You're just sitting there like... Okay.
[74:29.04]Go.
[74:30.56]This one's for real.
[74:58.75]Shit.
[74:58.99]It's a bad start already.
[75:33.70]What the?
[75:34.66]I pressed it!
[75:35.72]Okay, I'm going somewhere else.
[75:38.08]I'm going somewhere else.
[75:44.24]This guy hits too hard.
[75:59.14]He hits too hard.
[76:00.44]I'll come back.
[76:04.11]I almost killed him three times ago.
[76:06.01]And with all FromSoftware games, remember, you have to remember this.
[76:09.57]If you get a boss down to like two to four hits left and you die, just leave.
[76:15.83]Just leave and come back and come back like in an hour.
[76:18.83]Because what's going to happen after that is progressively that boss, that boss's health bar is going to increase by 10% every time you die after that.
[76:27.99]So just delete it from your memory.
[76:29.87]Fuck that guy and fuck his spam and fuck how hard he hits.
[76:34.86]Okay.
[76:36.76]Okay, good.
[76:37.66]Last dismissed.
[76:43.55]But, I'm not done over here.
[76:48.43]He's really salty.
[76:49.37]Actually, not really at all.
[76:51.91]Not at all.
[76:55.82]I came into this knowing that this was going to be pretty brutal.
[76:58.38]So, I am doing just fine.
[77:01.44]One more for the road.
[77:04.76]One more for the road.
[77:55.78]No!
[78:03.26]I wonder, do I just go up there and just try to stagger with swings in a row?
[78:06.76]I feel like that's the goal with this guy because he swings so many times in a row.
[78:10.62]Let me try that.
[78:14.31]That didn't work.
[78:17.65]That didn't work.
[78:30.44]Use the Frostblade thing.
[78:33.91]Yeah, I... It's good to... Yeah, I'm going to range him for a little bit.
[78:39.27]I'm going to use this.
[78:43.95]I don't think I hit hard enough with the actual melee swings.
[78:47.33]And I know I said that was one more time, but you know what?
[78:49.04]One more for the road.
[78:55.18]He's probably going to dodge all of these, though.
[79:00.85]catalog of fucking spells.
[79:02.21]That's hitting that.
[79:09.47]That's way harder.
[79:10.19]Maybe I should bring mana potions in here.
[79:28.77]Shit, I thought that thing can hit you when it's on the ground.
[79:32.31]When he slides on the ground, it can hurt.
[79:33.67]It can hit you.
[79:34.05]I think you have to back up.
[79:36.19]Just back up twice.
[79:37.07]Yeah, that's how you do it.
[79:49.60]It's back dodge and then forward dodge.
[79:57.27]That's... That sucks.
[79:58.93]Nothing I can do about that.
[80:36.53]I thought I had a little bit left.
[80:37.93]I didn't have any.
[80:51.64]No, it's too slow.
[80:52.80]That overhand with the baby rattle takes too long.
[81:13.92]Just... It's too slow.
[81:18.40]Too slow.
[81:18.76]I feel like I can do it.
[81:32.69]Time to grow up from the baby build.
[81:35.99]Should I just make everybody really angry and beat them right now?
[81:45.50]Let's see if I can beat him with this.
[81:53.03]Alright, Elden Lord, whatever your name is.
[81:55.33]That's not his name.
[81:59.86]I haven't played with the Moon Veil in a long fucking time.
[82:09.78]This thing is just... My computer just crashed.
[82:12.33]What the fuck was that?
[82:14.11]My screen just went black.
[82:31.41]Oh, that fucking hit recovery is so slow.
[83:22.78]Thank you for watching!
[83:49.69]Don't run after me!
[83:50.71]That's fucking scary, dude!
[84:34.91]Get me off the fucking ride!
[84:37.59]That was cheap.
[84:40.07]That was a stock scream, dude!
[84:56.65]Thank you for watching!
[85:32.28]Yes!
[85:36.21]I'd put on the Moon Veil and I'd beat him first try.
[85:38.17]Come on, man.
[85:41.11]Whoa!
[85:41.87]What the fuck is this?
[85:45.61]Yeah.
[85:46.43]Oof, that felt good.
[85:49.05]That's as far as you're gonna go, Gramps?
[85:52.83]No.
[85:53.71]Look at this item I just got.
[86:03.37]Just that little bit of extra range from the Moon Veil.
[86:07.52]It's like that extra Pinocchio lie.
[86:09.64]That extra one lie from Pinocchio made the whole difference.
[86:17.68]Okay.
[86:18.62]Great Sword of Solitude.
[86:20.82]You get the whole thing.
[86:21.96]I thought I was going to get the Machine Gun.
[86:24.64]What the hell is that?
[86:32.72]I guess listed in a way it's under the, oh, there it is.
[86:36.74]Okay.
[86:38.26]Strength.
[86:38.68]Alright.
[86:39.44]It's just a strength weapon.
[86:44.72]That was fun too.
[86:45.76]Damn.
[86:46.18]This is, I like this so far.
[86:47.46]That was fucking great.
[86:52.96]Okay.
[86:53.54]How many times did it take for you to kill that boss?
[86:57.83]You know, the average is 15.
[87:05.00]Like three.
[87:05.76]I did it first try.
[87:06.76]One, four, four.
[87:08.32]Well, okay, I did it first try with a weapon that was good.
[87:12.08]That counts, right?
[87:12.80]So I beat him first try.
[87:14.93]I beat him first try.
[87:16.83]I think that's fair.
[87:22.91]Ah, so just a great new... What is it?
[87:25.53]Solitary Moonslash.
[87:27.39]Sharply slash downward using the greatsword, shooting forward an arc of light.
[87:32.52]Does that scale with anything or is it just strength?
[87:34.24]It doesn't do magic damage.
[87:38.78]What does it look like?
[87:50.21]Did I pass by it already?
[87:53.29]Yeah, that was just a random mausoleum boss, by the way.
[87:56.89]Hey, this game's no joke.
[88:03.20]Where is it?
[88:03.58]Am I crazy or have I passed by it like five times?
[88:13.53]Oh, it's right there.
[88:14.05]Okay.
[88:14.23]I just want to see it.
[88:17.31]It's actually smaller than I thought it was going to be.
[88:25.64]Cool.
[88:31.62]Really cool looking.
[88:34.60]Alright.
[88:36.56]What about the lower?
[88:41.48]The nameless mausoleums of the Realm of Shadow are said to hold the spirits of warriors who lost their names or their hearts.
[88:50.80]And then through a secret rite, they relinquish their hearts for heightened battle prowess.
[88:56.92]Next, they engrave their blades with two crests, one depicting the light of birth and the other solitude.
[89:06.36]I think that's something to do with America.
[89:19.85]Dude, I screamed during that, and it really sounded like one of the stalk screams you've heard in cartoons before.
[89:24.33]It was like... I can't even do it again.
[89:28.17]Alright.
[89:31.54]I'm going to put the baby rattle back on.
[89:33.17]I have this too.
[89:35.11]Why don't I try this for a little while?
[89:36.15]This is only plus nine.
[89:37.87]But this thing's pretty cool, isn't it?
[89:41.85]This is the insect wing.
[89:43.81]This might be fun to use.
[89:47.95]Yeah, bug wing.
[89:50.87]I'll use the bug wing for a little bit.
[89:52.18]I'm not... Look, I'm not tied to any weapon.
[89:58.62]So what else is over here in my... Okay, I want to go up here.
[90:04.40]That was a fun fight.
[90:06.44]It was crazy because I've heard that the DLC is very hard, right?
[90:10.93]It's, oh my god, everything hits so hard.
[90:13.41]It does.
[90:14.85]But that still kind of felt fair because he was... I'm just, I'm suppressing a burp and it's been like this for a full minute.
[90:26.90]Okay.
[90:27.82]He was... God, just get it over with.
[90:34.85]I can't stop it.
[90:36.35]Okay.
[90:38.01]He's slow enough, but if you're going to be up there and kind of fight toe-to-toe with him, you just need to jump.
[90:45.90]You need to jump around and just do the R2.
[90:47.26]Jumping R2s against that guy is the way to beat him.
[90:50.18]Just getting in there and trying to swing.
[90:51.74]Swing!
[90:52.18]He's just going and he's in a five to six swing chain.
[90:56.20]And he ain't going to stop until he kills you in two or three of them.
[90:59.42]So it's all about knocking him down.
[91:04.36]I very much enjoyed that and we're going to mark it as complete.
[91:08.84]If you want to know how my system works in the DLC, this is the base game too.
[91:13.60]Sword means I did it.
[91:16.20]Skull means there's a boss there that I'll come back to later.
[91:19.53]Traveling means I want to make sure I absolutely come back and do this.
[91:24.09]And then the rest kind of don't really matter for me.
[91:28.13]Sometimes I'll use this to put the wind gusts.
[91:34.18]Okay, looks like there's not much over here.
[91:38.62]At least anything I can get into.
[91:43.07]I'm going to hug this wall.
[91:46.53]Because I'd be surprised if there wasn't a dungeon somewhere right here.
[91:55.83]Who could forget?
[91:56.42]Look at Ian off there.
[92:03.03]I have no- oh fuck, I have 70,000 souls and I have no heals.
[92:05.90]I need to set it at Grace.
[92:16.68]Did he just kill himself on me?
[92:24.23]It looked like he exploded into a thousand pieces.
[92:31.25]Whatever.
[92:32.86]You don't even need runes anyways.
[92:39.33]Runes are old news.
[92:49.91]This is, I don't know if this is completed, but I think it's for the sake of playing.
[92:54.96]I think it is.
[92:56.34]I want to go up here.
[92:58.42]I love these maps so much.
[92:59.62]My favorite part about Elden Ring is the map because it looks just like sorcery.
[93:03.96]I love the little details.
[93:05.64]I love the little, almost like cartoony look at the, these maps are great.
[93:09.91]So this looks like a very important area.
[93:13.61]We're not going to go there yet.
[93:15.23]I'm going to go, I need to, what is this blue thing?
[93:21.79]Alright, we're going to try to get up to one.
[93:24.13]So let's go from here.
[93:30.78]My favorite part of Elden Ring is watching Jerma play it.
[93:35.55]Um, you should play it too.
[93:37.97]Game is genuinely really, really amazing.
[93:41.00]It's really fun.
[93:41.62]It's might seem like it's really impossible, but you know, who's going to tell you to not like just go level the fuck up like crazy and come back with a couple of summons and get a bunch of spells and then kick the guy's ass.
[93:55.24]Like who cares?
[93:59.83]These games can be played so many different ways.
[94:02.03]You can go in Soul Level 1 and be like, holy shit, dude, you are a god.
[94:07.54]Or drink like eight different flasks, summon 15 people and just have a party and beat the shit out of the person.
[94:17.98]You can live somewhere in between.
[94:19.20]Usually I sit somewhere in between.
[94:21.33]I like to try to, you know, oh, can I do it without using certain items?
[94:25.65]Can I just use melee?
[94:26.75]Can I just use my, maybe I can just do it with this one spell.
[94:31.29]You give yourself little challenges.
[94:35.25]And I did that for the first five or six attempts.
[94:38.63]And you know what?
[94:39.87]Sometimes you just got to whip out the plus 10 moon veil and shove it through a guy's fucking ear.
[94:48.73]I don't think I want to do this yet.
[94:51.33]This is a very ominous hallway.
[94:52.65]I want to go this way.
[95:00.16]This might be too high.
[95:11.13]What about your runes?
[95:19.42]I don't think runes matter.
[95:21.70]I guess I could still technically level up.
[95:24.70]I have 55 vigor.
[95:26.78]70 intelligence.
[95:30.07]25 or 30 dex.
[95:31.01]There's not much else.
[95:32.19]I'm pretty hard capped on plenty of things, except probably for dex.
[95:35.11]So that is true.
[95:36.75]I should put points in dex still.
[95:39.66]Okay, so how do I get up here?
[95:44.08]Maybe I can't yet.
[95:44.76]Because that looks like it's all the way up there.
[95:54.40]Let's maybe... No, I don't think so.
[95:57.96]For weird rocks I can jump up?
[96:00.06]Maybe?
[96:03.62]Kinda.
[96:06.31]How far up can I go with this?
[96:11.29]I guess not.
[96:16.96]Why would they give you runes if they don't matter?
[96:18.66]Well, not that they don't matter.
[96:19.76]It's just if you... I mean, if you're like level 200, then you're not really getting much benefit from the levels anymore.
[96:27.70]If you're like 70 or 80 in every single stat, it doesn't really matter.
[96:31.58]But I don't have that, so you're right.
[96:34.22]You are right.
[96:35.92]I think I just see the Skadootree blessing thing and I'm like, oh, okay.
[96:42.99]I don't think... I think I have to go... How do I get up here?
[96:56.99]There's no little entrance somewhere?
[96:58.41]I don't think so.
[97:08.13]I guess not.
[97:16.05]But what if I go in here and then wrap around?
[97:18.06]I don't know.
[97:26.53]Level other stats too.
[97:28.43]Yeah, I really should put points into decks.
[97:33.80]I need another Grace up here too.
[97:35.30]Alright, I'm just going to keep going this way.
[97:36.54]We'll go into the area.
[97:37.76]It's very possible that this wraps around this left dungeon area, whatever it is.
[97:49.81]Are you hydrated?
[97:50.69]Yeah.
[97:56.47]I would say I'm very hydrated.
[97:57.73]I've got my drink right here.
[98:05.71]It's so crazy looking.
[98:07.03]I can't wait to figure out all the secrets.
[98:08.43]There is a Grace right there.
[98:15.91]And I see what looks like an NPC.
[98:17.73]Alright, everybody shut up.
[98:31.87]Whoa, what is that?
[98:35.20]A skidoo tree fragment.
[98:37.72]Touch the cross?
[98:38.56]Should I do that?
[98:44.22]Okay.
[99:02.36]Oh, another thing.
[99:04.00]Did you speak to our dour little friend?
[99:06.68]If you've yet to do so, have him give you a map of the Cross's whereabouts.
[99:11.53]You'll find more of them dotted about these lands.
[99:14.35]They are Miquella the Kind's footprints.
[99:18.89]If you've yet to do so, be sure to have our dour little friend share his map of crosses, assuming you intend to trace Kind Miquella's path.
[99:29.56]If you've yet to assume... Eh?
[99:33.70]Some of this person?
[99:36.95]Oh, hello.
[99:39.60]Another, treading the heels of Miquella.
[99:43.02]Then, as that woman would surely say, we are in our purposes well aligned.
[99:48.89]But understand, your kind are not forgiven.
[99:52.55]The Earth Three is my people's enemy.
[99:55.11]By Marika long betrayed, set aflame.
[99:59.07]I believe Miquella's apologies when he says our delivery will come.
[100:03.45]But never will I see your kind as worthy.
[100:11.04]It's too quiet.
[100:27.94]And yet my oath I cannot overlook.
[100:30.86]If Michela is whom you would seek, then comrade, allow me to give you this.
[100:37.11]These are the sites of the crosses I found.
[100:40.55]I urge you, follow after Michela.
[100:43.73]As long as you abide by his footfalls, you will be no enemy to me.
[100:50.21]Cross map.
[100:52.10]Map of cross sites received.
[100:53.40]Check in inventory.
[100:56.38]I urge you, as long as you abide.
[100:58.50]Okay.
[101:04.24]Mark the locations of golden crosses.
[101:09.56]A simple map drafted by a horn scent.
[101:12.70]Mark the locations of golden crosses.
[101:13.88]These crosses indicate Mikula's footprints.
[101:19.34]There's one here.
[101:22.36]What happens when I touch this?
[101:25.23]Okay.
[101:25.41]Need to stretch?
[101:25.93]Um... Yeah.
[101:26.65]Let's go ahead and do it.
[101:28.21]I'm going to refill my drink, too.
[101:29.79]So, I'll be right back.
[101:56.93]Give me two seconds.
[102:46.19]Thank you.
[105:38.14]I am back.
[105:40.40]I'm ready to keep going.
[105:42.62]Did my stretches.
[105:45.96]Here we go.
[105:47.88]Okay.
[105:54.31]Keep moving.
[105:58.05]So, Mikola has these little crosses.
[106:03.41]That'll help a lot.
[106:11.12]Looks like there's a... I want to... Let me see the map again.
[106:12.90]I want to zoom into that.
[106:24.83]There are three down here.
[106:27.63]Is that the one that's right in the... Is that right here?
[106:29.90]That's not right here, is it?
[106:32.86]Right in the middle?
[106:45.62]I'll find them.
[106:46.30]Wait, do I have enough to level up?
[106:53.08]168,000.
[106:53.74]The answer is no.
[106:55.78]But I actually... I think I have a lot.
[106:59.93]I do have a lot of these.
[107:04.27]Do I have enough to... I have, oh my god, I have a lot.
[107:06.21]10,000, 20, 30-ish, 40, not really.
[107:08.29]Broken rune?
[107:16.33]Golden traces of the Grace bestowed upon those who fell in the realm of shadow.
[107:21.37]Broken and faded, threatening to dissipate entirely.
[107:29.09]I still have the Elden Beast Remembrance.
[107:31.81]I never used it.
[107:34.89]We're yapping?
[107:37.37]I'm going to yap as much as I want.
[107:41.33]Alright, I don't have enough to level up, so we're just going to go.
[107:46.36]How much does the Elden Beast give you?
[107:47.82]I don't want to do that because what if I want the item?
[107:57.39]Okay, now that I have a boss fight, I can put the baby rattle back on for now.
[108:02.61]Because I do like it in an open world sense, but versus bosses, it can be tricky.
[108:09.60]Alright, let's move.
[108:12.94]Okay.
[108:24.70]A lot of gravestones.
[108:29.74]Wow.
[108:32.06]Cool.
[108:47.87]Where'd he go?
[108:52.59]Oh, push.
[108:53.81]Hmm.
[109:27.49]I forgot it's not B. Wait a minute.
[109:33.30]I can go there.
[109:38.11]Forget about the dungeon.
[109:38.93]We're going this way.
[109:59.46]Smithing Stone 3?
[110:02.16]That's really interesting.
[110:03.00]They're giving you very early Smithing Stones.
[110:07.62]I wonder if it's because... Never mind.
[110:15.35]I wonder if it's because they anticipate you're going to change weapons and they want to make sure you have... By this point in the game, you probably have an opportunity to get as many of those as you want, right?
[110:24.78]I'm going to get off the horse.
[110:28.97]Um, get off.
[110:30.45]Get off!
[110:43.56]Take it.
[110:45.90]I bet the item is totally useless and you should throw it away.
[110:59.03]Oh, come on, man.
[111:09.09]Sometimes I forget I have that.
[111:18.28]Jump his body into the fucking river.
[111:30.70]Holy shit.
[111:31.66]That was some goofy Disney shit.
[111:34.52]That was some Wile E. Coyote, yahoo-hoy type shit.
[111:39.80]All that was missing was a little poof.
[111:41.86]A little circle poof at the end. ...
[112:11.68]Oh, Erdtree.
[112:39.79]You look like a gym teacher.
[112:42.77]Why is your hat so big?
[112:43.83]Well, because this gives me plus damage to my cold spells.
[112:53.88]Hey, look, this is where I wanted to go originally.
[112:56.04]This is the way to go.
[112:58.24]You can get there from here.
[112:59.74]Nice.
[113:00.20]Okay.
[113:02.52]I think I see some log type enemies here.
[113:17.96]Omens.
[113:23.06]okay let's start with that because this is a blue circle and I want to know why it's like that we'll do the castle or that is next
[113:54.18]That's not a weapon.
[114:03.00]Gravity magic is disgusting, by the way.
[114:14.77]That rock sling does so much damage, it's ridiculous.
[114:25.45]I love this song.
[114:42.33]Ouch.
[114:45.79]Does that bleed?
[114:54.42]Nice bleed.
[115:07.42]Wait, I need these mushrooms to make the big pot, right?
[115:24.09]Can I make one now?
[115:27.14]Now it's red flesh mushroom, not the white flesh mushroom.
[115:36.06]That's where I was before.
[115:39.66]Nothing else over here like a door or a entrance to anything.
[115:46.15]Come on, that's not right.
[115:52.29]That's not right.
[115:52.87]This should be a door there.
[116:02.45]Use your hat as a parachute.
[116:15.02]Ooh.
[116:17.36]Consume this Ashen Scythe of Grace to bolster your Spirit Ash Blessing.
[116:22.38]Bolsters both Summon Spirits and Spectral Steed's abilities to... Okay.
[116:26.65]So, I want to read the
[116:31.74]lore on this something is coming at me oh no it's birds never mind we're good spirit ash of those who came before infused with potent spirituality acquired from the corpses of horn scent and other objects that ritually decorate townships and villages across the realm of shadow okay right the withered corpses were called tutelary deities and revered spirit ash was said to quietly accumulate in the palms of their hands
[117:04.58]interesting raw meat so now my summons will be better which we haven't seen mambo in a long time ready to rock I think that's probably it for right here is that what the blue is then or is it just no I think it's just the water
[117:36.20]I'm going to go all the way around first.
[117:54.99]I love the windup with this though.
[117:56.35]It's so funny looking.
[118:14.91]What you looking at?
[118:25.44]You good?
[118:36.55]I feel kind of bad.
[118:54.24]Hey, I can make it.
[118:55.12]Alright, we gotta use this on the next enemy.
[119:06.37]This is a huge fire pot.
[119:10.01]Maybe I should save it.
[119:13.25]Rip pondering bird.
[119:23.68]Okay, there we go.
[119:24.66]Wait, no.
[119:25.76]There we go.
[119:27.03]Let's move in a window so I can see better.
[119:28.33]I feel like I don't want to waste it on a bird.
[119:37.77]Golden sheep.
[119:38.47]What does that mean?
[119:39.01]What does a golden sheep mean?
[119:42.22]Does it mean something?
[119:43.62]Made it a solid gold.
[119:44.82]There's a giant sheep.
[119:50.58]Why is there a huge sheep?
[119:55.78]What a majestic, wonderful beast.
[120:03.13]What?
[120:04.37]Okay, that's... I don't want to hurt it.
[120:08.93]I'm not... I'm not going to hurt it.
[120:13.66]But I'm going to hurt this one.
[120:15.26]Because this one's... You're going to kill the horse, but I'm not careful.
[120:20.92]I had to do it.
[120:27.18]Why are these things so huge?
[120:35.54]I can get down there, can't... This is... That's gonna... What are you doing?
[120:40.99]Alright.
[120:42.79]I'm sorry, but...
[120:58.48]What the fuck am I doing?
[121:01.38]I wanted to heal and I like switched.
[121:03.46]I'm an idiot.
[121:05.42]I like was like, oh, maybe.
[121:09.45]I can craft another.
[121:13.33]Well, that's cool.
[121:13.85]There's a giant gold sheep over here.
[121:19.73]I have to try it.
[121:23.89]You think this will kill me if I fall down here?
[121:29.18]I don't know.
[121:29.70]Probably.
[121:30.20]I had to walk another 100 feet.
[121:44.53]That would have been fine.
[121:45.23]Oh, where was that?
[121:53.53]Okay.
[121:58.58]Okay.
[122:04.96]Back this way.
[122:07.32]Where was that?
[122:07.86]Where are my souls?
[122:13.26]Oh, I died all the way down there.
[122:14.87]There's definitely a way to get down.
[122:28.11]We are so back.
[122:29.34]Why?
[122:29.44]Because I fell off the cliff?
[122:41.34]There's a Grace down there.
[122:42.24]I need to get it.
[122:47.77]Remind me in 20 minutes to come back here.
[122:50.12]Because I want to do this thing up here.
[122:52.42]I want to do that.
[122:55.10]Do that.
[122:55.43]That's a reminder.
[123:11.34]What about, like, right here?
[123:12.24]Maybe not.
[123:21.33]Okay.
[123:21.67]Well, let's go around.
[123:25.19]You started down there?
[123:26.29]Dude, I did start down there.
[123:35.31]That's where I started the game.
[123:37.66]It got really foggy, and it looks different!
[123:39.88]It looks different!
[123:40.54]I got wicked foggy!
[123:42.61]This is a new zone to me, because of how different it looked.
[123:52.34]Oops.
[124:04.23]I think it just killed the big, uh, sheep.
[124:06.73]Did that just strike the sheep and kill it?
[124:13.18]No.
[124:13.78]Thank goodness.
[124:19.58]Oh, there's something here.
[124:20.30]What is that?
[124:30.99]Okay.
[124:32.77]Something over there.
[124:45.69]Oh yes, there are new paintings.
[124:47.77]That's actually a huge thing.
[124:50.35]I'm so glad that there's more paintings.
[124:55.13]So one of the things I loved the most about the base game... I just said it over and over again.
[124:59.66]I wish there were more of these.
[125:00.34]I wish there were more of these, but here they are.
[125:02.08]I hope there's at least three or four.
[125:04.88]At least.
[125:10.81]Okay.
[125:14.49]Artist shack.
[125:26.88]Okay, that is back to the start, so don't be stupid and go down there.
[125:30.80]But... There's an item right there.
[125:41.31]How did I miss that?
[125:45.32]Is that where I came out from?
[125:46.18]Hold on a second.
[125:53.18]Is it a cookie bug?
[125:56.44]I think you hear my jingling.
[126:02.38]Well, I can go.
[126:03.50]Don't push me off.
[126:09.45]Wait, this is different.
[126:10.75]Is this where I came from?
[126:12.77]It is where I came from, but there's an item that I missed.
[126:17.02]And I can go under the roof.
[126:19.52]Hold on, this needs investigating.
[126:40.77]Is this a bear with red hair?
[126:42.49]Oh, that's not good.
[126:51.16]Oh.
[127:10.25]Beast horn.
[127:19.04]Red hair.
[127:31.62]Alright, help me out.
[127:32.32]Did I go back here?
[127:33.74]And am I just seeing this from a different perspective and it's freaking me out?
[127:36.03]Or should I like jump in there?
[127:39.74]Am I just seeing this from the top down?
[127:41.22]It's like, ooh, cool looking.
[127:42.35]Or should I just go in there?
[127:45.87]I don't remember seeing that.
[127:46.71]Did I see it already?
[127:49.53]I feel like I'm losing my mind.
[127:51.81]It is new.
[127:52.43]Yeah, okay.
[127:56.19]This is up higher.
[127:57.71]I can't make this.
[128:04.77]I'm so scared to do this.
[128:08.22]Where's, like, the way to do it?
[128:09.18]Where's that best place to go?
[128:10.56]Right here?
[128:11.92]This is gonna kill me.
[128:16.57]Jump.
[128:16.91]No shot.
[128:17.73]Jump.
[128:18.07]No shot.
[128:19.13]It's an easy jump.
[128:19.93]Don't.
[128:20.65]Do not, bro.
[128:22.81]Ball joke actually incoming.
[128:25.35]Is this how you're gonna stretch a 50-hour DLC into 200 hours?
[128:28.35]I think this is higher.
[128:36.91]No, I have not been there.
[128:37.79]There's an item.
[128:38.25]Alright, I'm going to try to go right here.
[128:43.58]Fucking dead.
[128:52.59]I had no confidence doing that at all.
[128:55.35]Zero.
[128:58.58]Who is surprised?
[128:59.62]I don't know.
[129:00.14]You guys all told me I might be able to do it.
[129:01.84]Hey, you don't... Where are you?
[129:03.95]There you are.
[129:04.89]You don't know either.
[129:05.57]You just got the DLC too.
[129:07.21]You don't know where you're going.
[129:07.91]You don't know where you're going.
[129:23.77]church of benediction I want to get there hold on I'm gonna try this again but maybe all the way around here that you guys lied to me you lied to me
[130:01.38]I wonder if there's a way I can like go this.
[130:03.52]Let me see if I wrap around.
[130:04.84]There's the.
[130:09.54]Big sheep.
[130:14.45]Who?
[130:21.37]And I can wrap around here.
[130:42.10]Where am I going?
[130:42.76]Okay, yeah, this is the way to go.
[130:45.86]Bunch of liars in here.
[131:04.65]This is a church.
[131:05.29]I wonder, is there, there's probably a... What the fuck are you doing?
[131:26.47]Oh my god!
[131:27.36]Okay.
[131:27.72]Okay.
[131:34.64]fast he's here for one day only okay let's go back there I know there is a somebody drops down on you I'm gonna be off torrent I'm gonna be ready with give me the gravity
[132:05.19]like this is gonna maybe collapsing stars I do want to see what that does f the lightning pot that's cool so this was the trailer when the guy throws the huge pots I think you can build a character solely around being big hot guy which is cool
[132:44.01]How did that happen twice?
[132:46.17]Alright I'm ready.
[133:09.44]Oh!
[133:09.64]Run!
[133:50.44]Fuck this weapon!
[133:52.40]I wanted to scream, but I didn't want to scream because I didn't want to be wicked loud, so I just pressed it.
[133:58.04]And that came out very, very coward-like.
[134:00.76]I put, okay, I just put a compressor on my own in real life voice.
[134:20.89]America.
[134:23.75]Radagon.
[134:26.18]Ooh, Blessed Blue Dew Talisman.
[134:32.27]If you want to know my talisman.
[134:35.35]I got Urtree Favor +2, Rattigan Icon, which is shorter spellcasting, tons of powerful sorceries, and then charge spells and skills do much more.
[134:46.87]So when I go like this, hold it down, it hurts a lot.
[134:52.49]So what is that though?
[134:58.79]That's kind of awesome.
[135:01.07]Slowly, gradually restores FP.
[135:02.57]It was once thought that the blessed sap of the Ur-Tree would rip from its boughs forever.
[135:14.13]But that age of plenty swiftly came to a close, and with time, the Ur-Tree became more an object of faith.
[135:21.30]Doesn't really do anything.
[135:22.96]Yeah, my theory, I mean, it's not a theory, it's just kind of...
[135:27.47]Two Fingers are puppets.
[135:28.71]Everybody has strings.
[135:31.01]Uh... Two, like, is... And I got the two worlds.
[135:35.99]Um... Because everybody kind of has, like, a counterpart.
[135:42.05]Ooh.
[135:44.00]Both Secret Knight Greaves?
[135:46.22]I think the Two Fingers literally are puppeteering fucking people.
[135:49.14]That's what I think.
[135:52.14]Greater Will is, you know, there's a bunch of different gods meddling.
[135:56.69]Was bro cooking?
[135:57.61]Yeah.
[136:00.33]Well, you got the unallied gold needle, which is essentially in that gold needle.
[136:04.75]To prevent the kind of outer god's will.
[136:08.17]Yeah, because you don't want the Two Fingers to be doing the fucking marionette.
[136:12.33]I'm telling you.
[136:13.81]Strings, threads, everybody's got a thread.
[136:23.38]The Ur tree is a giant parasite.
[136:26.89]That's what it is.
[136:30.57]Pata?
[136:31.07]What is that?
[136:43.35]What's up with the glasses, you stoner?
[136:45.23]Because I have glasses on today, it means I smoke weed?
[136:49.74]I mean, I do.
[136:51.68]But not today.
[136:54.86]We need a clear head today.
[136:59.39]Um... Where is it?
[137:05.44]What kind of item is it?
[137:07.78]It's a fist weapon?
[137:14.14]That's pretty cool.
[137:16.94]Fist spike?
[137:18.46]This versatile armament can be swung about like a fist or used in the manner of a straight sword.
[137:25.33]Let me see.
[137:25.71]That's really cool.
[137:34.68]Where are the fist weapons?
[137:35.71]Down here, right?
[137:38.75]Does it not count as a... Wait, hold on.
[137:42.43]Is it just a straight sword?
[137:43.47]What the hell is this thing?
[138:03.62]Oh, there it is.
[138:04.40]Okay, so it is a... It didn't have the exclamation on anymore.
[138:12.24]That's cool.
[138:23.04]Let me put it... What is it in two... Oh!
[138:27.08]It's not just a one-handed.
[138:28.38]It's actually both.
[138:34.63]Okay, this is Baraka.
[138:40.53]Damn.
[138:41.59]These seem fun.
[138:44.35]Those seem pretty fun for all you dex users out there.
[138:51.48]You look like a Sailor Moon reject.
[139:00.72]Why?
[139:01.08]What?
[139:03.58]Because I have a big hat on?
[139:04.84]Does Sailor Moon have a big hat on?
[139:11.40]Read the armor.
[139:12.12]Screw.
[139:15.66]Where is it?
[139:16.04]It's no longer there.
[139:20.22]Okay, Oathseeker.
[139:24.66]These knights set off on quest of discovery, hoping to find by themselves an oath of their own choosing to serve in perfect, lifelong devotion.
[139:36.70]Their own choosing.
[139:37.54]How is this compared to the one I have on?
[139:44.23]Because I have the Royal Knight armor.
[139:48.79]How does that compare?
[139:49.79]I might put it on.
[139:50.59]A little worse, but lighter.
[139:57.94]By a lot.
[139:58.48]It's actually lighter by a lot.
[139:59.86]I'll put it on.
[140:00.32]We can have a little bit of variety, right?
[140:09.16]OK, cool.
[140:10.72]Anything else over here?
[140:22.79]Cool.
[140:32.73]It's like somebody playing a game of Spliff.
[140:35.13]Whoa, that's a dragon.
[140:37.11]I didn't realize what that was.
[140:41.73]Dragon with big hole in its chest.
[140:42.91]I think that's it.
[141:00.60]Ah.
[141:03.04]Ah.
[141:03.34]This is where I came from.
[141:04.22]I think that's it.
[141:05.86]There is this over here though.
[141:07.58]But.
[141:07.76]Let me go all the way to the front.
[141:23.22]Okay, I can go down there.
[141:24.10]I thought that was a death drop for the first time I saw it.
[141:36.37]I think I'm good to go down there.
[141:39.45]This is going to be so, this is going to be so scary.
[142:00.81]This is the beginning of the game, dude!
[142:02.09]What the fuck?
[142:03.05]The wraparound?
[142:04.69]FromSoftware did it again.
[142:06.40]Are you kidding me?
[142:09.72]They did it again.
[142:11.62]I can't believe I was all the way over there and I went all the way around to the beginning of the game.
[142:20.75]It's fucking crazy.
[142:32.15]Alright.
[142:35.15]I kind of want to see what's down here, but I think I'm more into this right now.
[142:40.59]We'll go in here.
[142:44.76]Right there.
[142:48.68]I want to see what that is.
[142:57.43]Dude, it's an Elden Ring.
[143:02.47]That is fucked up, man.
[143:03.63]It's an Elden Ring.
[143:07.57]I did the thing where you're really, really sleepy on the phone and you said something and I just repeated what you said in a very tired voice.
[143:17.44]And added one word to it.
[143:19.72]I'm really sorry about that.
[143:26.46]The Elden Ring, the map is a ring.
[143:27.86]It's like shaped like a ring.
[143:30.32]Yeah, the map is shaped like a ring.
[143:32.82]What the fuck?
[143:36.59]I do that all the fucking time.
[143:38.79]I really do.
[143:39.43]It's bad.
[143:47.75]And then they get you.
[143:48.59]They get you.
[143:49.13]It sucks.
[143:50.08]They say, hey, dude, say the last thing I just said.
[144:00.72]and you search for like a full minute it's like god damn it please don't call me out on this ooh ooh
[144:37.48]I was holding a string.
[145:14.43]Something I'm noticing with the DLC.
[145:17.18]It seems like every little area.
[145:19.10]We're good.
[145:23.36]Everything's very tall.
[145:24.82]All the stuff is really high up.
[145:28.04]So you end up scaling vertically more than horizontally.
[145:31.82]It's pretty cool actually.
[145:42.53]It's a normal height for the rest of us.
[145:44.39]This is like seven or eight thousand feet in the air.
[145:48.03]Ban that person for at least five minutes.
[146:04.26]Can I go that way?
[146:10.13]Oh, they're playing!
[146:17.44]You alright?
[146:17.92]I heard a lot of loud sound.
[146:41.64]Shipping container?
[146:42.42]What is that?
[146:47.12]Okay, that's where I was thinking about going before.
[146:55.44]This goes up real high.
[146:56.58]Yeah, it's a shipping container.
[147:05.71]Yeah.
[147:06.71]Yeah.
[147:08.43]That's it.
[147:24.73]See anything?
[147:28.15]Really, it's very pretty.
[147:29.67]Gonna go to the top.
[147:37.08]That looks very dangerous.
[147:52.12]They eating people.
[148:01.65]Well, that's a Statue of America.
[148:20.09]Bad idea.
[148:20.95]That was a very bad idea.
[148:26.81]Oh!
[148:31.55]I'm going down.
[148:32.51]I'm going down.
[148:34.71]I thought that I could jump up there and maybe they would just start walking off the edge.
[148:40.85]I see that little lip right there.
[148:41.97]I thought I could just catch it.
[148:43.03]I thought I could catch that lip and jump up and watch them all just walk off.
[148:52.89]I'm right here.
[148:53.27]It's fine.
[149:06.89]That was close.
[149:26.54]got you ow that hurts
[149:57.43]Ooh, blood, blood friend?
[150:00.91]Blood fiend's arm.
[150:02.29]Okay.
[150:20.67]Where's the blood fiend arm?
[150:38.03]Weapon used by the Blood Fiends.
[150:39.29]An arm pulled from the corpse of one of their kin and wielded as a makeshift weapon.
[150:43.39]Having been sanctified by a blood ritual, this armament is capable of spraying blood stored within when executing a strong attack.
[150:52.02]Arcane.
[150:54.90]Need some new arcane weapons in the game too, so that's cool.
[151:00.74]How's the game so far?
[151:01.72]I think it's lovely so far.
[151:05.16]I just started like an hour or two ago.
[151:07.65]I'm taking my time, so I'm just... You know, I have walked off the edge a few times, so that probably added about 20 minutes, but... I love it.
[151:15.41]I think it's great.
[151:20.49]I'm very excited to continue to play through it.
[151:25.28]I don't have the arcane to be able to show off that weapon, but if you're an arcane build, they did add a new arcane weapon, so that's pretty cool.
[151:35.60]How many arcane weapons are actually in...
[151:38.29]The base game.
[151:38.83]I feel like there's not very many.
[151:41.93]Five?
[151:42.31]Ten, maybe?
[151:43.87]Less than five?
[151:44.41]There's like three, or there's like two.
[151:47.55]Really?
[151:47.81]Damn.
[151:48.05]Because I know, um... Ooh.
[151:54.18]Sanguine Amaryllis.
[151:55.52]What is that?
[151:58.66]Grown by blood fiends in pools of blood.
[152:00.74]Perhaps even the fiends admire blood's beauty.
[152:05.53]Some other stuff I got here, too.
[152:06.55]What is this?
[152:07.27]Beast horn.
[152:08.96]The Crucible has a particularly strong influence on the beasts of the Realm of Shadow, causing many to grow horns despite the characteristics of their species.
[152:16.66]The whole Crucible stuff is crazy, too.
[152:18.68]All the... just, like, primordial... beings.
[152:24.53]Like, this tree is the Erd... was the Erdtree put on top of the... kind of the Crucible Tree, whatever.
[152:30.95]There's a lot of shit going on in this game.
[152:33.98]Shit's... messed up.
[152:39.10]Ooh.
[152:40.82]Worth it to come all the way up here.
[152:43.10]Outer God Heirloom.
[152:45.53]Now we're getting... Now we're getting somewhere.
[152:48.87]Raises Arcane.
[152:49.93]It's also been engraved with the lore of an Outer God.
[152:56.00]What is that?
[152:59.04]The clan who lost everything in the Great Fire has peered upon the corpse of their ancestor...
[153:04.55]normally an act of sanctity, and saw in its shadow a twisted deity.
[153:08.24]The clan had suffered such torment that the horrible thing was taken as an object of worship.
[153:32.44]He's putting on glasses and now suddenly he can read the story things.
[153:36.48]True.
[153:41.27]You guys know I'm supposed to wear glasses.
[153:44.41]Like when I do any media like this.
[153:50.08]Sharpens up everything.
[153:52.65]My eyesight is fine, but... Like, I really am supposed to be wearing... Can I get... I can get up there.
[153:59.23]I'm really supposed to be wearing glasses when I do... Because when I... Remember, you've heard me complain a million times about... I can't... I'm too far away.
[154:05.83]I can't see.
[154:06.45]I'm too far off the screen.
[154:08.73]That this alleviates that, so... I think that's the only thing up here, but it was cool.
[154:16.94]Outer God Heirloom.
[154:18.02]I'm curious about what they were talking about.
[154:21.10]What are they talking about?
[154:21.72]The deity was like twisted and messed up?
[154:25.80]And they started... I'm... Get batty on the fucking phone.
[154:40.93]Yeah.
[154:42.17]I don't know.
[154:42.51]Alright, I think I got it.
[154:49.17]I think I did everything.
[154:52.28]At least in this section.
[154:53.43]I might be missing something.
[154:55.11]Maybe I can get up there, but I don't know.
[154:56.47]Maybe I can't.
[155:01.79]I am going to exhaust it, though.
[155:09.75]Something tells me I probably can.
[155:16.24]Dude, we're all so fucked up from this.
[155:18.26]Like, yeah, I opened up Jerma's stream, and he was trying to jump on top of the roof because he was convinced there was an item up there.
[155:26.74]Look at how messed up we all are now.
[155:31.32]Like, there's nothing up here.
[155:33.32]But we've been conditioned so much to be like, wait!
[155:37.45]Go around the back.
[155:38.91]You can jump up on the first balcony and then jump to the other roof.
[155:42.61]And then from that roof, jump to the third roof and then go up there and you go to the top.
[155:46.63]And by the way, it's a legendary talisman.
[155:48.07]You better put it on.
[155:55.93]That's alright.
[155:58.11]Me strong can figure that part out with his playthrough.
[156:01.43]Alright, so now where do I want to go?
[156:03.53]I want to say probably around here.
[156:07.05]Mark this as completed.
[156:08.35]One, two, five.
[156:12.33]What is it?
[156:14.27]Can I make this jump?
[156:19.03]What do you think?
[156:19.63]Place your bets.
[156:20.13]Is from there to there going to kill me?
[156:25.25]I feel like no.
[156:30.45]Maybe.
[156:31.64]I don't know.
[156:36.69]It's probably a yes, so I'm just gonna go the long way.
[156:41.11]Ah, there we go.
[156:41.52]If you're looking for items, if I miss something, it's gonna be your fault.
[157:17.74]Oh.
[157:17.80]Alright, let's go.
[157:18.16]There's much more to see.
[157:26.88]The DLC is so well crafted.
[157:30.42]It's very dense.
[157:32.63]Let's just put it that way.
[157:37.69]I haven't even... I haven't fucking done anything.
[157:42.21]I haven't done anything.
[157:46.60]This is where I've been in two hours.
[157:50.26]I've been everything so dense.
[157:56.55]Well, there's also this.
[157:57.43]I'm trying to look at like I'm doing a lot of looking.
[158:00.09]I'm doing a lot of taking it in.
[158:06.17]I said pots.
[158:12.51]I guess throwing shit.
[158:13.45]He's about to throw it.
[158:14.98]Where did that guy go?
[158:18.49]That guy disappeared.
[158:19.55]He was holding the pot over his head.
[158:27.97]Spirit gravestone?
[158:29.15]Okay.
[158:50.91]Hmm.
[158:53.22]Check down here.
[158:55.50]Have to check.
[158:56.30]Hmm.
[159:26.33]Hey, fight another boss and spend three hours on it again.
[159:28.25]This stream's only been live for two hours.
[159:36.54]Got him.
[159:39.26]I hope people left for that one.
[159:45.32]That may have been the worst thing I've ever done on camera.
[159:48.82]And you know what?
[159:49.26]I don't give a fuck.
[159:56.38]He wants people to leave.
[159:57.94]Hey, you can do whatever you want.
[160:04.63]You can stay.
[160:11.77]You can leave.
[160:13.23]You can hang out.
[160:14.01]You can go get the game.
[160:14.85]You can play it.
[160:15.37]You can have it on a third monitor.
[160:17.18]Second monitor.
[160:17.74]You probably have like three other streamers open right now.
[160:22.47]But like, if I talk louder, I'll talk over the other two people you have open in the other monitors.
[160:27.49]That's the real game.
[160:28.49]Are you checking in where everybody else is?
[160:36.26]Nah.
[160:40.36]If I talk louder, then you'll hear me over the other four streams open.
[160:49.09]Damn, okay, that looks cool.
[160:53.00]Uh, I think I exhausted everything over here.
[160:54.62]That is a great view, though.
[161:02.78]That place looks huge.
[161:04.36]Am I going there?
[161:05.23]I think I'm just... I think I'm just gonna... Whoa, that is way far away.
[161:11.35]Alright.
[161:13.59]Okay.
[161:15.15]I'm going in.
[161:17.35]Either that one...
[161:19.24]this one or something else completely entirely different do I want to go straight here this is just I going to make a decision yeah let's go that way oh my god I just knocked over my computer
[161:50.34]You're bad at sticking to a path.
[161:51.94]Yeah, I know.
[161:55.58]It's actually a problem.
[161:56.98]I need to see everything and I need to look at everything.
[162:00.45]Everything's so packed in densely.
[162:04.31]What?
[162:05.61]I'm going this way.
[162:29.64]I keep thinking the graves are items on the ground.
[162:36.08]No, stick to the path.
[162:40.04]Hey, look!
[162:41.76]A, uh, Mikolas, uh, cross, whatever it is.
[162:46.82]Damn.
[162:49.91]What is going on up here?
[162:57.21]Thanks for the free Skadootree Fragment.
[163:01.42]I abandon here a part of the flesh of my body.
[163:03.46]I think they all say it.
[163:06.14]You must be the tarnished.
[163:08.12]I am Ansbach.
[163:10.32]Formerly in service to Lord Moog.
[163:13.14]But now, like you, another soul guided by kindly Mikkola.
[163:17.34]I'm hardly the steady hand I once was.
[163:20.90]My fighting days are far behind me.
[163:23.70]Which is why I have chosen to dedicate myself to investigation.
[163:27.90]To discern tender Mikkola's ultimate purpose.
[163:31.25]I'd rather not volunteer service to a new master unless I know that I can be of use.
[163:39.47]May I request a service of you?
[163:43.62]Six crosses identical to this one have been discovered in these lands.
[163:48.44]They are akin to tender Nicholas footprints.
[163:51.85]Or gravestones, which mark what he's left behind.
[163:56.13]If you discover any more crosses, be certain to tell me.
[164:00.35]I presume you too are keen to know just what kind Michela is doing here.
[164:08.46]If you discover any more crosses, be certain to tell me.
[164:11.56]I presume you too are just what we're going to find all the crosses and then tell him about it.
[164:17.86]I thought it was another person.
[164:18.96]Who's this?
[164:20.39]Hello there together.
[164:22.75]We work together for Michael of the kind.
[164:26.98]Many things we have found.
[164:31.92]Oh shit.
[164:39.33]Hmm.
[164:41.89]Well, this is preparation.
[164:45.97]Ooh, new notes.
[164:47.35]This feels crazy buying one of these now.
[164:50.35]Right?
[164:51.39]I like finding things.
[164:53.74]For you, Lady Letter, our allies, and the Forager Brute.
[164:59.58]Things bring joy to all.
[165:03.38]I like for you... Like finding things.
[165:06.76]Alright, what's this note?
[165:10.30]Goodbye.
[165:16.26]you chance upon a sealed spirit spring look for stacked stones nearby by toppling them you may break the seal I'm so glad I bought this this would have I would have been a breakdown I would have been like red yelling at people in chat banning people people like you are so stupid knock the rocks over and be like you think they would make it that easy
[165:42.44]No, you have to do an emote for five straight minutes in front of it.
[165:46.48]Have you ever played these games before?
[165:50.64]Places where the dead have been brought since antiquity.
[165:55.11]The oldest gravestones turn into spirits and then fade away.
[165:57.73]Okay.
[166:02.51]I think I'm ready to go in here.
[166:07.67]And deal with whatever is in here.
[166:13.99]What great room do I have on right now?
[166:15.53]Godrick?
[166:16.07]Yeah.
[166:18.01]It's not activated, but I don't think I've really had a need for it quite yet.
[166:26.86]Let's go.
[166:41.61]Pickle of the Haligtree.
[166:48.85]Sit down.
[167:09.12]Anything else?
[167:14.78]Gotta be thorough.
[167:17.22]Never know.
[167:23.56]Alright.
[167:26.16]Open the gate.
[167:33.53]There's no way you're gonna open this door by yourself.
[167:36.19]You need 40 people to even get this thing to move one inch.
[167:44.11]Cool.
[167:46.46]Oh, what the fuck is that?
[167:49.78]What is hanging from the ceiling over there?
[167:53.82]That's a big spider.
[167:54.58]That's a ju- It's a scorpion!
[167:57.40]Whoa!
[167:58.42]I know I'm like, I'm doing the pog thing right now, but... Oh yeah, you're... You're stuck.
[168:07.59]Allow me to introduce to you... Cheese.
[168:22.31]Yeah, that's cool.
[168:23.35]That's awesome looking.
[168:26.45]I hate that shit.
[168:30.03]But I love it.
[168:30.71]It reminds me of the spiders in Bloodborne.
[168:33.43]You remember the huge spiders?
[168:35.21]And you open the door and they're all hanging?
[168:37.82]That is one of the single coolest and worst things of that whole game.
[168:47.38]Scorpions are so cool, though.
[168:57.11]We get some fucking repelling.
[169:08.60]Scorpion liver.
[169:09.48]Another spirit ash thing.
[169:20.00]These people are these people.
[169:21.34]I thought they were alive.
[169:23.10]Are they?
[169:27.21]Oh, I tried to lock on.
[169:29.31]Okay, hold on.
[169:29.89]Give me a second.
[169:30.71]I tried to lock on to the guy on the stairs and it... That's fucking weird, man.
[169:40.95]Is it a spider?
[169:42.91]I hate it.
[169:50.08]No, it's a scorpion.
[169:51.18]It's hanging from the ceiling.
[170:05.39]Any animal that sits upside down for a prolonged period, I don't even get it.
[170:10.63]Imagine you going to bed and just like, oh yeah, time for like time to go to sleep.
[170:15.03]And you just lock your feet in the ceiling and just hang yourself upside down.
[170:19.86]That would suck.
[170:24.57]bats yeah why do bats do that like what isn't gravity like doesn't the I feel like it would make I feel like a puke because they're badass yeah they are
[170:43.36]Bats are awesome.
[170:44.52]But I just don't know how animals do that.
[170:46.46]A lot of animals will kind of hang or grip.
[170:49.78]Birds do that too, right?
[170:51.38]Birds will grip something and just kind of sit there and sleep.
[170:55.12]Imagine holding on to the... You lay in bed and you just grab a chunk of either side, left and right of your mattress and just fucking grab it with your hands and your toes tight and then fall asleep.
[171:08.10]And you still hold it the whole time.
[171:11.29]That's crazy to me.
[171:14.49]I would just wake up falling one day and you'd be like, okay, well, this is it.
[171:31.40]Scorpion designs are awesome though.
[171:38.25]What a cool ass animal.
[171:41.67]have a tail that curves up it has a spike on it and it's it's filled with poison and you like holy you're aggressive you're more aggressive than anyone
[172:12.15]Venom, bro?
[172:14.49]Yeah, but I mean, yeah, it's Venom.
[172:34.80]Ilarot?
[172:35.74]Tower Settlement.
[173:03.35]like ancient oh shit hold on dude look at it this is where like the ape slowly kind of turns into a person and then keeps growing with you know standing up straight and shit yeah
[173:28.22]Dude, that's Caesar.
[173:29.52]Are we shortcut?
[173:45.61]Yeah.
[173:52.30]Crazy.
[173:52.62]Does anybody else feel like this?
[173:54.44]Playing a... Playing a Souls game in particular.
[173:58.02]I don't know what it is about them.
[173:58.96]I mean, I do know, but... I just love the idea.
[174:03.71]Like, I love the idea of thinking of making, like, a level.
[174:08.33]Do you work backwards?
[174:09.87]Do you work forwards?
[174:12.21]I think once you play a game like this, you go like... Oh, what?
[174:14.79]Okay, that shortcut.
[174:15.76]Cool.
[174:17.72]Do you make the door to the shortcut first and work backwards?
[174:23.87]Level design is such an interesting thing.
[174:25.40]I've always thought about maybe one day, like, I would just want to do it.
[174:31.58]Just for fun.
[174:32.44]Just like, I'm going to design a level.
[174:33.98]Yeah, it'd be with like crayons and, you know, show it to my mom.
[174:41.10]But after you play Elden Ring or Dark Souls, for some reason, you just kind of just start thinking about how cool the concept of making a game actually really is.
[174:49.83]A good one, right?
[175:04.61]I thought that was illusory.
[175:05.68]Well, I was going to be so small.
[175:07.24]What is this?
[175:10.48]Is it just kind of dirty water or is this something else?
[175:15.25]The River of P. Don't minus to me because all of you just said it too.
[175:23.11]You have to minus to yourself.
[175:49.83]Silver horn tender.
[175:51.45]I want to look at that.
[175:54.17]Old currency used by horn scent made by coating spiral horns with silver.
[176:00.40]Oh, a boost item discovery.
[176:02.32]And also be sold for a high price.
[176:04.56]These trinkets were once symbolic of society's upper echelons.
[176:09.74]Silver horn.
[176:22.66]Shit, you're gonna give me a well right now?
[176:24.42]You guys are beefy.
[176:41.25]Uh, I'm going down the well.
[176:42.15]Let's take our chances in the dark.
[176:50.36]Did you cut these sleeves off?
[176:53.74]Yes.
[176:55.86]I'm just gonna make you believe that that's what it is.
[176:57.74]So you can... I don't know, be angry about it.
[177:02.30]Ah.
[177:22.40]Messmer Fire Grease.
[177:24.28]It's a different type of damage.
[177:26.64]Messmer Fire.
[177:34.63]Incendiary Materials.
[177:36.35]Yeah, okay.
[177:37.95]Fire was a symbol of the Crusade, and even Messmer's rank and file soldiers would wield it.
[177:44.84]I guess it's just more fire.
[177:46.94]Okay, so... Can't do anything down here yet.
[177:59.00]I need... Okay, remind me that there's a locked door down here.
[178:06.51]Please.
[178:07.53]When I get the key to the sewer grate...
[178:11.57]Make sure I want to look over here and I only want to see people spamming.
[178:15.35]Get in the sewer, get in the sewer, get in the sewer.
[178:19.29]But not yet.
[178:19.77]That's going to happen in probably like an hour.
[178:23.36]Or more.
[178:23.72]I think if I walk off a bridge or not, or like walk off a cliff or walk off the edge of a rooftop, right?
[178:30.12]Like, I don't know.
[178:32.28]Depending on how many times that happens in the next hour.
[178:35.58]Please remind me.
[178:53.18]Hmm.
[178:55.06]Hmm.
[178:57.35]Why is this all back here?
[179:09.39]Okay.
[179:10.01]Oh.
[179:11.27]Interesting.
[179:11.75]Hmm.
[179:27.08]I'll deal with that later.
[179:28.78]That hurt a lot.
[179:59.83]I can't.
[180:00.35]I can't kill that guy.
[180:01.65]I can't.
[180:04.61]I can't do it.
[180:05.13]I can't.
[180:07.49]I can't do it.
[180:28.90]That thing does a lot of damage.
[180:59.73]they can aim the other way can't they whoa oh bad don't run into the courtyard they're gonna shoot with the things
[181:28.14]Oh, fuck you, dude.
[181:29.30]Come on.
[181:35.92]Oh, right in the fucking teeth.
[181:46.47]Oh, that got a little hairy, but I'm good.
[182:01.12]It's fruit.
[182:02.02]These vegetables look pretty fresh.
[182:03.98]That tomato looks great.
[182:08.91]But when you take a bite of it, it disappears.
[182:10.59]It's not real.
[182:11.15]It's a shadow.
[182:16.28]Ooh, cool.
[182:38.94]Will you shut up?
[182:39.72]Uh oh, he saw.
[183:01.58]I feel like something... I have more than one of these.
[183:03.62]Alright.
[183:07.76]What is behind the door here?
[183:11.97]Now, those are the people doing the... Those are the Mikula's rings, right?
[183:15.07]The... The spells?
[183:20.01]This is like Mikula's spell.
[183:21.29]I think that's what it is.
[183:26.00]Who's Mikula?
[183:28.14]Um...
[183:30.75]You got a long way to go.
[183:32.15]I would suggest you start walking out of the tutorial area in Limgrave.
[183:37.79]That's where you should start.
[183:44.58]Who's Miquella?
[183:48.66]Am I missing something?
[183:51.90]Ah, I am missing something.
[183:53.48]The rooftops.
[184:00.96]Shatters are dropping like flies right now.
[184:07.06]You never addressed this, but why was your bone structure yassified during the birdhouse stream?
[184:16.77]Did I go, did I walk through a wormhole?
[184:18.87]Why am I reading a chat message from a stream that happened like five years ago?
[184:25.90]I don't know, man.
[184:26.84]It's been fucking four and a half years.
[184:28.76]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[184:42.84]I wonder how much they sell for.
[184:43.83]Oh cool.
[184:50.09]Look how high up this goes.
[184:51.57]This is ridiculous.
[185:00.96]It all goes up and I'm going to be up there probably in 15 minutes.
[185:04.00]OK, hold on.
[185:07.28]Where do I go from here?
[185:11.73]Or the other side?
[185:21.74]I have to get down.
[185:22.46]And whatever else go this way in the know.
[185:28.35]Starting to look more and more like your character.
[185:40.25]Cool.
[185:45.70]Seems pretty cool to me.
[186:03.25]A lot of parkouring.
[186:04.09]Which I actually really like, so I'm glad it's here.
[186:07.44]Can I get on Torrent?
[186:09.96]No, Torrent's not available here.
[186:11.04]A Smithing Stone.
[186:24.06]Cool.
[186:45.83]Your dad maxing right now?
[186:48.79]Yeah, I guess.
[186:58.72]What is down here?
[187:03.57]That's all I get for my curiosity.
[187:15.19]up the other staircase I'm not gonna sit I don't think are we taking bets if he has pants on well just do it because um I can prove it either way oh not one of these things
[187:55.51]Oh my god!
[187:56.63]Dude, this...
[188:37.90]Alright, baby rattle.
[188:40.04]Time to put you away for a little while.
[188:42.15]We're going bug wing.
[188:43.65]I feel like bug wing could be a little bit better for us.
[188:54.89]Let's give it a shot.
[189:21.19]That guy was rough.
[189:43.73]Bugling's a little faster.
[189:44.75]Cool.
[189:54.92]Nah, I'm not going to sit.
[189:56.16]Why would I do that?
[190:09.87]Always take the weirdest route first.
[190:18.87]Until you realize it doesn't do anything.
[190:22.93]Just recorded yourself in front of.
[190:24.80]A ton of people.
[190:27.50]Doing a whole lot of nothing.
[190:36.68]I never doubt yourself is what I meant to say.
[190:39.97]Second, somebody doubts you and what you're doing.
[190:46.67]Is there anything even back here?
[191:21.28]Don't you dare.
[191:24.12]That's a cool spell.
[191:24.92]Probably can get it.
[191:25.72]Not yet.
[191:42.88]Foul, tarnished.
[191:46.34]In search of the Elden Ring.
[191:54.18]Let me extinguish thy flame.
[192:01.85]You can go that way, that way, or this way.
[192:04.11]I'm gonna choose this way.
[192:19.60]those stripped of the Grace of gold shall all meet death in the embrace of Messmer's flame invaded by I guess coming over the pa system alright let's go
[192:50.43]Oh, wow!
[192:51.77]That hurt a lot.
[193:07.30]Ugh.
[193:09.74]You out of mana too?
[193:10.70]Yeah, me too.
[193:14.64]Let's settle it then.
[193:25.56]How many did I... I just correct like six times.
[193:54.69]Don't do it.
[193:55.53]Don't do it!
[194:04.11]What was that?
[194:09.84]Bye-bye.
[194:14.72]Crusade Insignia.
[194:38.72]the talisman.
[194:41.24]That was a fun fight.
[194:51.61]Stretch break.
[194:54.01]Yeah, no, I will.
[194:54.73]I've been okay.
[194:56.39]I'm very, very well prepared for this day, so don't worry.
[195:00.66]I'm okay for now.
[195:02.92]I do need to get up pretty soon, though.
[195:06.02]I want to look at what that thing is.
[195:08.47]Ash of War, Shriek of Sorrow.
[195:16.08]Shriek, skill utilized by the downtrodden.
[195:18.60]Scream, causing nearby enemies to flinch while also recalling deep-seated resentment.
[195:26.12]Boosting attack power based on the amount of HP remaining.
[195:29.70]The lower the HP, the greater the effect.
[195:32.96]They added a scream?
[195:34.46]Okay, I have to play with that.
[195:44.28]Raises attack power after defeating an enemy.
[195:46.99]It's another one of these.
[195:47.73]There's one that is in the game so far where if you crit, you get more attack power.
[195:57.15]I wonder how long it lasts.
[196:05.62]It's only a PvE item, though.
[196:13.72]Bro, you look like Gen Z Jesus.
[196:27.91]Well, I'm not in Gen Z, so that doesn't make any sense.
[196:34.41]Um...
[196:44.69]I think bugs just came out of my nose and I don't even care, honestly.
[196:46.99]It's weird.
[196:51.86]Well, I don't really use that stuff, but it's cool.
[196:55.00]I wonder if it stacks indefinitely until you rest or die.
[196:59.20]That's what I really want to know.
[197:00.60]Cool.
[197:00.78]What else is up here?
[197:03.28]Bug wing.
[197:04.76]I think we're going to have to get this to plus 10.
[197:06.17]Because I was cooking with this thing.
[197:17.57]It's just so much faster.
[197:18.45]The range isn't that great, but it's so much faster.
[197:22.61]I think the weapon art is better too.
[197:24.25]It happens right in front of you, happens quick.
[197:26.41]I like it a lot.
[197:33.40]Okay, can I open any of these?
[197:42.46]Doors?
[197:42.85]There's one that way, but what about this one?
[197:44.81]No.
[197:44.95]No.
[197:54.08]Maybe that's all that was in here.
[197:55.10]I think that's it.
[197:57.32]It was like three ways to go, so I wouldn't be surprised necessarily.
[198:09.21]These are all a little bit.
[198:10.13]Oh, I am just like walking over this.
[198:18.04]Looks like I can do that, right?
[198:40.51]that out here.
[198:43.57]I could really use a sit down.
[198:47.41]I think I'm okay for... Oh!
[198:49.37]That hurt my whole body.
[198:50.19]My whole body hurts.
[198:51.87]That actually just... Somebody stuck a spear through my back.
[198:55.57]Somebody's in the room and they stuck a spear right through my back.
[199:01.61]Oh my goodness.
[199:02.69]Why did that... There's just one of these little shadow guys.
[199:07.71]To me, there was not even an indent there.
[199:12.07]Like, I walked in like this.
[199:14.57]To me, that is a wall.
[199:16.19]There's no indent.
[199:18.69]Man.
[199:22.89]Scare Saturdays.
[199:37.26]Oh, get out of here.
[199:42.75]This had that move, by the way.
[199:44.49]And it's awesome.
[199:45.39]And I cannot believe I forgot it existed.
[199:56.67]Ow.
[199:57.11]Oh, no.
[199:57.49]This is bad.
[199:58.53]Ugh!
[200:28.10]I love this weapon.
[200:28.97]It's so good.
[200:29.81]It's so good.
[200:30.47]It's so good.
[200:31.03]It's so good.
[200:36.69]Okay, I got really turned around.
[200:37.96]Where am I?
[201:23.62]That is so scary.
[201:24.88]I'm so glad I'm not over there.
[201:26.24]Yeah, are they flies, but like mosquitoes, hornets, wasps?
[201:34.29]I think it's a wasp.
[201:42.95]OK, I have to really put my gamer pants on here, because if I die to this, I'm going to be very sad.
[202:04.31]Oh my god, run!
[202:05.17]Okay, we're alright.
[202:10.71]Everything's fine.
[202:21.29]I'm so glad I have my little magical sword.
[202:23.23]And it doesn't cost any mana to do that.
[202:29.07]There's a guy right there.
[202:43.61]Someone's gonna come behind me.
[202:46.96]That's it?
[202:49.50]string somebody gonna climb down the waterfall god damn it there's gonna be somebody else in here this guy almost just killed me
[203:19.40]Do I have a shield I can put on?
[203:20.66]I think I should probably put it on.
[203:21.96]I'm sorry, I have to kill everybody.
[203:24.90]I cannot afford to press triangle on this ladder and have that guy stab me in the back.
[203:42.60]This guy looks like me.
[203:47.29]Alright, somebody take a screenshot and put glasses on him.
[203:53.75]Put glasses on this guy.
[203:56.72]And make it look nice, you know what I mean?
[203:58.46]Make it look good.
[204:08.81]You look so sad.
[204:09.89]Why have those sad eyes?
[204:26.38]That's not the sewer key.
[204:29.44]That is the key that's upstairs.
[204:31.88]Making sure there's nothing else here.
[204:52.59]Don't get cocky.
[204:53.65]What are you, stupid?
[205:22.38]I got the key.
[205:28.69]I'm going to do this now that I'm not fighting that boss.
[205:30.87]Let's give a couple of the mana potions so I can do some more of my spells.
[205:43.67]Alright, I want to get back to where that was.
[206:00.15]Holy shit, these guys are crazy.
[206:09.10]I have a hundred... I lost a hundred thousand souls.
[206:16.79]Whatever.
[206:17.45]I don't care.
[206:18.61]I thought I could rest to the fucking Grace.
[206:20.37]I'm not going to swear for 25 minutes.
[206:33.91]zero zero point zero these guys are insane okay well we didn't even need a hundred thousand souls you see how much other money I have I have all these things I have six of these they're worth six
[207:04.55]Whatever.
[207:06.23]Okay.
[207:07.33]Let's get back to where I was.
[207:08.33]I have mana.
[207:13.96]I need 170,000 souls to get one point of level.
[207:19.12]So, we're not missing that whole lot.
[207:24.82]I'm kind of wasting mana on these guys, honestly.
[207:52.49]That just killed me.
[207:55.87]Oh my goodness.
[207:57.07]Alright, I'm going to stretch, I'm going to pee, and I'm going to grab a pillow and just scream into it.
[208:06.87]Your camera's covering souls.
[208:08.24]That's a good idea.
[208:08.68]I'll move it.
[208:09.32]I gotta pee.

[216:04.00]That's how you take care of those two.
[216:09.45]Gonna throw a moon at somebody.
[216:26.34]That works.
[216:26.70]It's getting a little dark down here.
[216:37.17]I think maybe we get a.
[216:40.37]It was a little bit of style, I think.
[217:02.60]Oh dude, that was the part when the director nodded to the audience.
[217:05.04]It was so, like, interesting.
[217:18.50]It's so hard.
[217:34.58]This place is huge.
[217:36.00]I did not expect it to be this big.
[217:38.56]It's monstrous.
[217:56.39]Oh, little bugs.
[218:06.86]Jeez, I gotta get through my entire list.
[218:16.40]So satisfying.
[218:24.69]I don't... Yeah.
[218:26.48]I was going to say, I don't like this room.
[218:29.20]That's a red scorpion.
[218:30.86]They bite harder.
[218:33.34]And the... Yeah.
[218:37.32]Is it red?
[218:43.63]This one is... Is this one bigger?
[219:04.89]Oh, that fucks him up big time.
[219:06.91]Alright, I'm using that more often.
[219:08.19]Uh-oh.
[219:17.64]Wow.
[219:18.38]Okay, the anti-scorpion weapon is the... Funnily enough, the bug wing.
[219:25.25]That thing is disgusting against these guys.
[219:27.77]Bonebow.
[219:35.09]Medium for spirit calling and a product of the ancient hexing arts of the tower.
[219:40.59]Rancor shot and view arrows with vengeful spirits before firing a barrage.
[219:50.44]I want to shoot it.
[219:51.06]Let's see it.
[220:06.28]This thing is really, it's just kind of like a stick.
[220:08.66]Look at how little this is.
[220:10.14]Alright, let me see what it does.
[220:25.81]Rancor shot?
[220:26.75]Do I have some regular arrows?
[220:33.83]Yeah, let me see.
[220:40.68]Am I doing it?
[220:42.96]Unique skill.
[220:43.66]Am I not pressing the right button?
[220:52.29]I mean, it's not L2.
[220:53.75]Imbue arrows with vengeful spirits before firing off a barrage.
[220:58.67]Chase down foes as they cut through the air.
[221:01.83]Wait.
[221:02.01]I mean, does that just shoot?
[221:04.73]I mean, I want to see what it does.
[221:06.60]Homing arrows?
[221:12.30]I just wanna find something to shoot.
[221:17.38]Okay, so what if I do this?
[221:27.01]Oh no, it has to be like... Jesus, that is... What happened to the bird?
[221:34.66]Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[221:37.66]This thing is awesome.
[221:41.50]That's actually, I want to make a character just to use this weapon.
[221:59.59]Oh, thank God.
[222:00.53]I have literally a sliver.
[222:04.19]Sliver.
[222:08.74]That's a really cool item though.
[222:12.37]So they do home.
[222:13.43]I was curious if you could get it to do it while you're aiming in a random direction.
[222:22.59]You're on the wrong flask.
[222:28.15]This is why this is why you guys are around.
[222:42.52]I think that's it.
[222:42.98]That bird was wild.
[223:03.22]There's three more of these.
[223:04.44]This place kind of reminds me of, um...
[223:12.11]Almost like a more put-together Farum Azula.
[223:15.76]It has that kind of ancient vibe to it, but it's not floating around and crumbling.
[223:20.52]Hold on, hold that thought.
[223:38.51]What are you even talking about?
[223:39.73]Farum Azula!
[223:43.63]You've played this game, and if you haven't, then you are ruining your experience of looking at a DLC before you even know what game it is.
[223:52.39]I'm going to pull this guy all the way back.
[224:00.00]Okay.
[224:17.12]what the fuck oh my goodness don't you dare okay we're good oh it's I you blended in with the environment I didn't even see you
[224:46.82]That's where I came from.
[224:47.62]Can you backstab these birds?
[224:52.47]Probably not.
[225:01.40]He's stuck down there.
[225:04.56]See ya.
[225:19.84]golden horn it was like a treasure goblin oh no no no I don't want to go that way if there's an alternative I'm gonna go that way I don't want to go I don't want to fight that thing I don't want to fight that guy I'm not fighting this thing I'm gonna stealth
[225:56.93]Sometimes the game is not to play.
[226:00.59]Especially when you've progressed as far as I have.
[226:12.48]I totally forgot that guy was there.
[226:15.22]And I saw him sitting down too.
[226:39.88]Bug.
[226:49.13]Ladder.
[226:49.49]Okay, what about over here?
[227:00.54]Don't want to fuck with that guy.
[227:06.17]Good.
[227:32.28]Big room.
[227:33.10]Whoa.
[227:33.70]Okay.
[227:34.16]Oh, another spirit thing.
[227:51.41]Don't.
[227:53.39]Oh!
[227:54.47]I got double tapped.
[227:59.31]I got hit by the
[228:01.70]Holy damage from the ground and his swing.
[228:06.35]That serves you right.
[228:07.27]Why?
[228:07.41]Okay.
[228:07.79]It's time to run.
[228:32.73]You'll never catch me!
[228:46.85]Fuck all of you.
[228:47.39]I got up.
[229:10.38]I have to commit.
[229:15.60]Oh shit, they're all coming up the ladder.
[229:17.42]Okay.
[229:23.54]Are they all going to come up?
[229:24.69]Oh, come on.
[229:26.19]Why are you guys still coming up here?
[229:42.91]I should have been able to go first.
[229:43.81]Okay.
[229:50.68]I think I'm fine now.
[229:52.30]I should be good.
[229:52.76]The bigger the hat, the bigger the power.
[229:59.45]Kind of true.
[230:18.80]Resistant to frost?
[230:38.77]Those guys are rough.
[230:39.83]If they actually hit you with the claw claw claw claw claw, it probably kills you.
[230:59.06]Okay, this is pretty much back where I was.
[231:00.68]I have to read the description of the gold one.
[231:14.45]Alright, let's bait this out.
[231:21.70]Kermit, you're going to rage on this boss.
[231:29.29]Maybe I will.
[231:37.41]Who's your favorite Muppet?
[231:39.05]Probably Gonzo.
[231:41.01]Gonzo.
[231:43.02]Rolf.
[231:44.80]Kermit's up there at probably S tier.
[231:48.38]Gonzo is the best though.
[231:50.20]How could you not love Gonzo?
[232:04.57]It was risky, but I did it.
[232:11.65]Where's the critical?
[232:24.58]Garfield impression?
[232:25.36]I can do a Garfield impression for you.
[232:27.68]Hmm.
[232:30.36]Okay.
[232:34.08]Lasagna.
[232:40.36]This is down here.
[232:41.00]I was going this way.
[233:03.89]Worst impression ever.
[233:04.89]I don't do impressions anymore.
[233:06.33]I don't do impressions.
[233:07.01]I used to.
[233:09.35]Alright, I know what I need to do up here.
[233:18.57]Watch and learn.
[233:43.64]Wow!
[233:44.44]Holy shit, that was... What?
[233:48.26]He barely even touched me.
[233:51.06]These guys are dangerous.
[234:07.71]I hear him.
[234:08.98]Uh oh.
[234:10.28]He found me.
[234:11.12]He caught up to me.
[234:11.82]He caught up to me.
[234:21.28]End of the line.
[234:27.55]I'm still alive.
[234:32.41]Dude, how are you still alive after falling down here?
[234:40.63]Don't crouch, get up.
[234:44.47]Get out of here, you fucking bugs.
[234:50.50]Hey, well, I lost him, so I don't care.
[234:55.24]I just lost all of them.
[235:00.16]Yeah, no way we see that guy again.
[235:15.35]Maybe something down here.
[235:17.65]Not, I mean, I've been down there.
[235:18.77]I'm talking about just on the carpet.
[235:23.36]Eh.
[235:27.62]Can you do Mr. Dink?
[235:29.86]Uh, yeah.
[235:44.46]I don't care if I spam... ...Glintstone Pebbles at this guy.
[235:48.56]I am... I'm sorry.
[235:50.56]I'm not dealing with that.
[235:53.81]We're not dealing with that right now.
[236:04.39]God!
[236:09.15]That was... That was actually really good, but... Fuck, man.
[236:12.04]I don't like it that I did it on camera.
[236:25.73]If anybody ever laughed like that, I feel like everyone just gets quiet.
[236:30.58]Oh no.
[236:33.62]Oh no.
[236:34.24]He just ran right through it.
[236:50.23]Didn't even care.
[236:50.91]Dude, no.
[236:58.84]no no no no why don't you go down there with the scorpions no I'm not doing we're not doing it uh-huh
[237:37.01]Items?
[237:41.77]Hey!
[237:45.97]You're quite handsome for a spam Andy.
[237:48.03]I did it once in the three and a half hours I've been playing this game.
[237:53.80]I'm a magic user.
[237:54.78]That's what we do.
[237:56.28]Summon?
[237:59.52]Oh, you can summon Freya.
[238:01.70]That's cool.
[238:03.10]I'm imagining behind this door is a boss.
[238:06.02]I don't know why this would.
[238:07.32]There's no way it's not.
[238:12.33]Well, let's do it.
[238:13.75]I'm excited.
[238:14.21]Ow.
[238:14.53]Alright, everybody.
[238:16.85]It's time.
[238:19.89]It's time.
[238:44.03]O horned dead beast from higher sphere delivered, take root inside the tower sculptor keepers, and perched within, we beg of thee, rise.
[239:14.39]And those who plague the tower, cleanse away the strumpet's fire.
[239:51.46]going down Divine Beast Dancing Lion let's go
[240:21.21]This thing is creepy.
[240:28.87]Holy shit.
[240:36.89]This thing is awesome.
[240:41.91]He isn't ready.
[240:44.59]Well, judging by the fact that they put the Grace right here, I imagine this boss is going to be pretty rough.
[240:52.26]This is only plus nine.
[240:53.76]Probably not a good idea to use right now.
[240:57.15]I'm going to give... I'm going to give an attempt with the baby rattle.
[241:00.41]I feel like range is not going to be a problem here because it's huge.
[241:09.73]Also, we might get an opportunity to call in the boys.
[241:20.29]I'm going to do some Flintstone spam for all you haters out there.
[241:23.81]Okay, it starts with that every time I think.
[241:35.93]Holy shit.
[241:38.65]Okay.
[241:38.81]Okay, so.
[241:42.69]Starts off.
[241:43.33]It's going to go and shoot right out the front.
[241:48.99]You didn't know 80k gone.
[241:51.67]It's fine.
[241:52.09]I've lost 180.
[241:52.39]Okay.
[241:52.51]Maybe like two or 300 attempts.
[242:02.55]We'll get it.
[242:22.99]Whoa, the tail moves too?
[242:25.47]Holy shit.
[242:45.96]uh something I'm noticing I don't know if this is happening to anybody else uh my game is doing the thing when Elden Ring first came out do you guys remember when Elden Ring for that like launch day is it doing that thing where it's putting all everything into cash where like it freezes is that is it doing for everybody I feel like it did that for the first day that I played Elden Ring and then it was like fine
[243:15.29]Yeah, shader compiling.
[243:16.35]That's what it feels like it's doing.
[243:27.46]One, two.
[243:27.88]Alright.
[243:29.58]Down, down, dash.
[243:47.77]I just want to see all the moves, honestly.
[244:07.57]One, two.
[244:14.71]Oh!
[244:19.98]Oh, how can you tell when he's going to do it?
[244:24.38]He just kind of hovers and then flies at you like a bullet.
[244:49.26]Jesus.
[244:54.53]Okay.
[244:54.91]Yeah.
[244:56.11]Okay.
[244:57.31]So when he's hovering, he goes like one, boom, one, boom.
[245:03.85]This music is amazing.
[245:04.65]I love it when it stands up so much.
[245:16.00]The design goes so hard.
[245:17.02]It looks, it looks phenomenal.
[245:19.67]Alright, Mambo, let's see what you got.
[245:22.63]Come on out.
[245:25.01]Mambo.
[245:27.83]It's been a year since we've hung out.
[245:30.33]Get him.
[245:34.50]Oh, Mambo doing work.
[245:45.24]Ow.
[245:58.68]damn okay mambo's amazing let's just get that out of the way that's the okay that move I gotta get that down I don't you know no summons or anything
[246:15.48]I just want to... You got to like absorb all the moves.
[246:19.64]It's like he does... I think when he... When he closes his mouth maybe?
[246:31.63]Is that like the time to dodge?
[246:37.36]Damn.
[246:45.85]There it was.
[246:46.33]It's hard to tell because he gets really close to the screen and it's hard to see if he's doing it.
[246:50.83]Maybe this isn't a lock on fight.
[246:54.05]I feel like it has to be though.
[247:02.68]Oh shit.
[247:24.82]I am barely hurting this boss.
[247:40.37]Whoa.
[247:42.13]Whoa.
[247:55.07]Maybe rattle not working?
[247:56.95]I mean... I don't think anything's gonna work.
[248:02.44]I think I gotta just keep rolling and learning.
[248:23.99]shit look too early so hard to tell damn oh slow jump where's the barf drink or something
[249:02.05]I also have the Grace.
[249:02.97]I don't have to do this right now.
[249:07.65]I feel like he is very very strong.
[249:15.67]That is that the opportunity to attack him like truly.
[249:25.75]Damn it.
[249:34.57]Alright, do it.
[249:35.28]Yep.
[249:36.18]One.
[249:37.50]Oh, man.
[249:38.70]I thought it was a little bit longer.
[249:40.46]I need more fragments.
[249:49.78]Yeah, definitely.
[249:58.94]I wasn't doing terrible damage.
[250:00.58]It's just the opportunity to actually swing.
[250:02.94]It's like, when is it and where is it?
[250:15.67]Damn, I thought he was going to do the dive.
[250:17.41]That was a tail whip.
[250:22.75]Shit.
[250:49.15]If I get that down, I'll be alright.
[250:51.77]Maybe it's dodged through, not to the side.
[250:53.49]Maybe it's dodged to the up?
[251:32.99]Yep.
[251:36.93]Dog's forward.
[251:50.67]He's low.
[252:11.43]Ah!
[252:11.69]I panicked.
[252:29.67]I'm in trouble.
[252:37.17]I'm dead.
[252:43.39]That was... That was alright.
[252:50.36]Out of flask?
[252:51.04]Screwed.
[252:54.96]Alright, so when he goes... You know what's really getting me now?
[252:59.20]Is when he goes... Up for a long time.
[253:03.32]And he just, like, crashes down.
[253:08.13]Okay.
[253:11.25]I...
[253:14.89]I like this fight a lot, though.
[253:19.99]I don't know if I want to keep banging my head against the wall.
[253:22.33]I might need some more blessings, but... This fight's cool.
[253:27.82]I like it a lot.
[253:36.01]Once you get out of the rhythm, it's GG.
[253:37.35]GG.
[254:00.15]Bad spot to be in.
[254:03.10]Oh, fuck.
[254:03.54]I thought he was going to dash.
[254:11.92]Okay, there's a third.
[254:12.76]There's a third time.
[254:13.80]Oh, whoa.
[254:14.78]What?
[254:16.69]There's no delay.
[254:23.17]Yeah, it's coming.
[254:28.19]Alright.
[254:31.36]I'm bringing out Moonvale.
[254:37.43]Moonvale's coming out.
[254:44.45]I could do spells.
[254:45.05]I don't think I want to cast spells, honestly.
[254:47.77]No.
[254:49.25]I really don't think so.
[254:50.89]Because in the time it takes me to go, like... I'm dead.
[254:55.45]You're dead.
[254:57.52]Let me try a few with the Moonvale.
[255:00.00]with this sweet weapon.
[255:12.86]Dodging way too much.
[255:44.97]That one gets me too every time.
[256:01.50]Oh.
[256:05.92]Oh.
[256:06.60]Lucky.
[256:08.54]Oh, he's doing so much shit this time.
[256:32.85]That was stupid.
[256:39.56]That was dumb.
[256:41.40]I was just like, let me slash him for no reason.
[256:49.75]The problem is you don't know your enemy.
[256:51.29]Try watching a YouTube video of a real Dancing Lion.
[257:01.34]You know what?
[257:02.42]I think I'm gonna get it.
[257:04.41]And then he'll go to phase two and I'll go... No!
[257:08.87]And then I'll leave.
[257:53.10]Not good.
[257:56.18]Not good.
[257:56.70]I don't know where the fuck I am.
[258:15.49]No, that's lame.
[258:30.31]That one gets me every time, man.
[258:31.85]Every time.
[258:44.46]Fuck.
[258:46.16]Ah!
[258:49.84]Don't heal right in front of him.
[258:52.02]Sometimes you gotta, like, catch the dodge right when he does the move, get a frame-perfect drink immediately.
[258:58.67]Sometimes it's the only time you got.
[259:04.99]I really, I wish I could just take his model into like a training dummy zone and just practice that one move.
[259:21.66]I was, I played that correctly.
[259:24.60]I ran, I ran away.
[259:35.31]Oh, what is this?
[259:36.65]Boom, boom.
[259:47.63]It's a lot to remember.
[260:15.71]camera you're not helping me here whoa what are you doing it's just lightning and everywhere the is the lightning what's happening
[260:51.58]God!
[260:53.59]What the fuck?
[261:01.17]Oh man, this is not gonna be fun.
[261:18.01]What the fuck?!
[261:32.23]Wow, that was something.
[261:34.59]That was something.
[261:37.83]This looks harder than Slime Rancher.
[261:48.01]Wow!
[261:49.07]Hey, it's... Hey, guess what?
[261:50.45]It's alright to like something, alright?
[261:52.41]A little sloppy.
[262:12.10]It's alright though.
[262:31.84]That lag is killing me.
[262:34.90]Yeah, come on man.
[262:43.17]That lag is annoying.
[262:50.89]Excuses?
[262:55.27]When is it gonna load all my stuff into memory so I can... No.
[263:06.72]Uh, we're doing Mambo in phase two, by the way.
[263:10.66]Oh my god.
[263:11.58]That's a bad... I'm gonna just... No.
[263:16.00]I mean, look at where I am.
[263:17.94]How did I live through that?
[263:21.17]Did I just figure out how to do that accidentally?
[263:23.55]Do you stand right next to him?
[263:38.39]I think you stand literally right next to him.
[263:50.15]It's getting worse.
[263:52.61]They're like.
[263:56.05]The like cash lag, whatever you talking about, seems to give it seems to get worse.
[264:08.32]Restart the game maybe.
[264:09.58]Maybe reload the area.
[264:14.40]Come back with fresh eyes.
[264:18.76]Yeah.
[264:20.05]But it's so fun.
[264:20.93]It's such a cool boss.
[264:22.42]I just... The music change.
[264:25.26]That was so cool.
[264:26.83]I have to see it again.
[264:45.34]Let's go, Mambo.
[264:48.18]Oh, I'm so sorry, Mambo.
[264:50.78]I didn't mean to do that to you.
[264:58.17]Mambo, he's over there.
[265:03.29]Get him!
[265:07.17]He's almost dead.
[265:40.52]Oh, actually, that's not a bad place for it.
[265:47.86]There he goes.
[265:52.64]Oh, Bombo, I'm so sorry, but I don't think you're going to make it.
[266:05.45]Dude, jump over it.
[266:22.78]Do I jump?
[266:24.02]Do I jump?
[266:25.92]I think so!
[266:35.81]Whoa!
[266:55.90]What is that?
[266:56.42]What's it changing to?
[266:57.20]Lightning?
[266:58.94]Wind?
[267:01.20]Dude, you got every element in the fucking cookbook!
[267:06.91]What do I do?
[267:07.51]Oh!
[267:28.33]Lightning again.
[267:29.73]Lightning's the worst one.
[267:36.74]I don't have any fucking mana!
[267:52.17]What the fuck is happening?
[268:08.76]Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.
[268:19.48]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[268:21.93]I'm still alive.
[268:35.62]Oh, shit.
[268:43.38]Dude!
[268:46.08]No way, man!
[268:56.36]Oh, boy!
[268:57.92]That was pretty good, though.
[268:59.00]That was not bad.
[269:00.14]That was pretty good.
[269:02.18]That was pretty good.
[269:05.51]I think that was pretty good.
[269:07.69]Okay, I'm sorry.
[269:11.59]I understand what's going on.
[269:13.58]So, I'm getting the thing where my glasses are burying into my face.
[269:17.23]You know what I mean, up here?
[269:19.87]Okay, so.
[269:21.45]A couple things.
[269:22.41]First thing.
[269:25.01]He does the same moves.
[269:25.73]They're just a little different.
[269:29.97]Get more when the summoning's distracting.
[269:31.69]Yeah.
[269:33.71]I feel like I'm just barely starting to learn the actual moves, but he does the breath.
[269:38.42]It's ice breath.
[269:39.28]He does the lightning, but I thought it was a completely different moveset.
[269:50.45]You just need one mana flask?
[269:51.63]That's also true.
[269:55.01]I think I can do it.
[269:55.93]I think I can kill him pretty much within the next five to ten attempts.
[270:05.89]Just relax your butthole.
[270:10.41]Actually, I did that halfway through that fight.
[270:14.50]Because it was very, very clenched.
[270:20.76]Okay.
[270:21.80]Is it a better idea to get... You know what I think I'm going to do here?
[270:25.53]This is going to be fucking crazy.
[270:28.61]I don't think this is a mambo fight.
[270:29.81]I think this is the boys.
[270:38.76]Make it happen.
[270:48.19]Usually he starts with the breath.
[270:52.76]There he got me.
[270:55.68]Oh, that's not a good start.
[271:10.82]Mambo carried last time, but I think I want a bunch of distractions.
[271:15.54]I think having five just random dickheads running around, I think is a better idea.
[271:23.22]This fight is awesome.
[271:25.42]Like really cool.
[271:27.16]I, this is up there.
[271:35.43]As difficult as this kind of is, it's not even... It's just about patterns, right?
[271:40.32]Pretty much the entire game.
[271:46.14]Boys!
[271:50.48]Get him!
[272:02.67]I got greedy there for no reason.
[272:11.07]He ate me?
[272:12.47]How did you not eat one of the five?
[272:14.35]He's not even hitting him.
[272:20.56]He just healed to full health.
[272:30.45]Okay, that got a little fucked up.
[272:37.55]Yeah, Mambo's better.
[272:40.67]Any parts you dislike so far?
[272:43.95]Um, I think it's a little too early to give any complaints.
[272:47.39]Because take a look at the map, right?
[272:51.03]This is all I've done.
[272:52.52]And when I say all I've done, I mean the place is very dense, right?
[272:54.90]But this is the first major area I think I've came across.
[272:59.72]I did a couple of small things.
[273:00.94]I fought a mausoleum boss down here.
[273:04.44]Explored over here, explored over here, did this, did that.
[273:09.04]I feel like there's still... I mean, look up here.
[273:12.95]There looks like there's one, two, three, and then a whole nother part of the map.
[273:22.65]There's a lot to do.
[273:25.74]Bombo is going to outlast the boys.
[273:27.10]I could also try this too, but...
[273:30.68]I don't... I think I'm... I think I can do it.
[273:32.96]I think I can do it with Mambo and the boys.
[273:35.92]Alright, here we go.
[273:36.70]Real attempt, coming up.
[273:38.38]Sorry, Mambo.
[273:47.45]Bad place to start.
[273:50.01]Get in the fire, yes!
[273:58.02]No, I didn't want to do that.
[274:13.51]Shit.
[274:15.21]Timed it wrong.
[274:15.75]Oh, come on, man.
[274:25.08]I would love Mambo for phase two.
[274:41.08]Alright, come on Mambo.
[274:42.02]We got it.
[274:42.36]We got it.
[274:42.66]You and me.
[274:43.22]Mambo's dead.
[274:43.70]No, he's not.
[274:44.24]He's good.
[274:44.56]He's good.
[274:44.80]He's good.
[274:57.16]Jesus!
[275:01.99]Whoa!
[275:04.73]I haven't seen him do that, I don't think.
[275:10.41]Lightning's the worst.
[275:21.39]Shit!
[275:43.00]Fuck.
[275:50.10]I dodged through that.
[275:51.12]I did it the same way every time.
[275:52.82]Dude, the fucking game is lagging!
[276:29.37]No, anything but this.
[276:30.50]It gets me every time.
[276:48.46]I had to use like three or four flag because the game is just like he he does like a cool move that shows a bunch of like cool particles.
[276:57.31]And my game goes to like two FPS.
[277:05.15]OK, I'm going to like turn off.
[277:07.03]Hold on a second.
[277:08.77]What is going on?
[277:09.53]What I turn this to like low, right?
[277:11.79]Like medium or something medium.
[277:14.11]What should I do?
[277:16.65]What do I do?
[277:20.91]Resolution is high.
[277:27.17]We fight this guy in 1080?
[277:29.95]I feel like that's not helping, though.
[277:31.12]I tried turning it down and it, um... It was still doing the same thing.
[277:36.24]I'll try it, though.
[278:05.14]Where are we?
[278:13.52]I gotta stand right next to him when he does that.
[278:15.52]This is not a bad start.
[278:33.89]I don't have enough mana to- Whoa!
[278:39.01]Oi!
[279:04.72]It's doing it still.
[279:13.50]Doing it worse than it was worse than before.
[279:31.01]Oh.
[279:41.27]Come on boys, you can do better than that.
[279:58.87]Still doing it bad.
[280:43.46]Oh, no.
[280:45.48]Oh, goodbye.
[280:56.60]It's kind of worse at 1080.
[281:02.35]I want to at least make it look better.
[281:17.80]You look like a doctor I would eat bugs with.
[281:19.76]You should close other programs.
[281:22.21]Um... Yeah, close OBS.
[281:31.49]Getting your ass kicked in 4K, yeah.
[281:35.77]I feel like with the right... Like, sauce.
[281:38.88]I'm gonna do it.
[281:44.12]I had to restart my PC.
[281:47.69]Uh, let me restart the game.
[281:49.37]That's not a bad idea.
[281:50.19]Not a bad idea.
[282:00.73]Use the dev summon.
[282:03.81]I am going to use that summon.
[282:07.58]Maybe.
[282:09.52]I think me and Bombo got it under control, though.
[282:15.20]let me like quit out of the whole game okay out of the game just take a look at this for a few minutes while I get this figured out I'm gonna restart sounds good and maybe it loaded everything in the cache he's already turning purple
[282:44.98]I am a little purple, aren't I?
[282:46.00]Alright, let's start again.
[282:54.23]Full screen borderless has the frame hitching.
[282:55.95]Go full screen.
[282:58.68]I'll try that too.
[283:03.54]Is it Mambo?
[283:04.36]It's Mambo, M-A-M, Mambo.
[283:14.72]Keep your mouse on the second monitor in borderless window.
[283:17.22]It's a weird fix, but it might work.
[283:28.83]You take the lag away.
[283:29.71]I think I got it.
[283:31.85]And I'm going to use that as an excuse permanently.
[283:46.40]Yeah, I'll do the full screen.
[283:48.04]See if it helps.
[283:48.44]Okay.
[283:59.57]We're in full screen.
[284:03.35]It's a lot more annoying to tab out, though, so I'm not going to be able to tab out that much.
[284:09.62]But, see if that helps.
[284:17.08]I'll be able to tell pretty much immediately because it usually happens right when he does the first dive.
[284:21.28]No, it was right there.
[284:34.17]Yep, still happening, but it's alright.
[284:38.89]It's alright.
[284:39.55]I'll do it anyways.
[284:47.15]I keep forgetting he does that right after.
[284:48.65]Shit.
[285:10.74]Shit.
[285:11.30]Oh, please, burn it into your long-term memory to stand right next to him after he does the double dash.
[285:21.35]Yeah, start it over.
[285:22.43]He does the dash, dash, and then he spins.
[285:25.03]As long as I'm standing right next to him, I can beat the absolute crap out of him.
[285:36.90]I unironically disabled the last four to eight cores in the task manager thing.
[285:45.57]Is your SSD full?
[285:47.07]No, it's like not even halfway.
[286:07.91]I know he does it.
[286:08.57]I know he does it.
[286:11.95]Yep.
[286:13.03]That's the ticket right there.
[286:14.51]All of you watching right now, if you're having trouble with this fucker, you gotta... You can stand right next... Do you know what?
[286:21.08]We'll start over.
[286:22.78]You can stand right next to him when he does that.
[286:25.40]So he... It's GG now.
[286:28.24]GG.
[286:28.38]GG.
[286:42.87]Now the rhythm will start because I'm not going to run away when he does that.
[286:46.46]Let's get Mambo immediately.
[286:47.64]Alright, let's go.
[286:49.00]This is the one right now.
[286:54.33]Okay.
[287:17.24]Shit, I tried to put it away.
[287:18.46]That's my bad.
[287:21.86]Dude, come on.
[287:32.18]Alright, one, two, three.
[287:34.82]Now get in here.
[287:40.62]He didn't do it.
[287:44.47]He usually does the spin.
[287:45.83]He didn't do the spin.
[287:54.90]How come he didn't do the spin?
[287:57.80]You got outlived by Mambo.
[287:59.26]Good.
[287:59.48]That means he's good.
[288:09.81]That doesn't work.
[288:10.69]Never mind.
[288:13.95]Does it?
[288:15.21]Why did I... I'm confused now.
[288:19.60]I'm very confused.
[288:23.15]Looks like there's little sections that pop out maybe.
[288:25.01]Alright.
[288:39.49]Huge problem with this guy is sometimes he'll just do a regular swing and you're just not ready for it.
[288:48.92]It's like, okay, here it comes.
[288:50.02]He does all these crazy things and then here he is.
[288:52.60]Swing regular.
[288:53.16]It's like, oh, fuck.
[288:54.42]I forgot he can do that.
[288:55.62]I forgot he can actually just attack you with like an R1.
[289:03.65]Okay.
[289:06.41]New strategies.
[289:29.66]God damn it.
[289:31.00]I thought he was done.
[289:31.60]Alright, so it's one, two.
[289:51.05]It's a lot slower than I think it is, actually.
[290:33.57]No, camera, stop, please!
[290:36.72]No!
[290:39.55]No, camera, why?
[291:13.38]I'll go get him!
[291:40.66]Shit!
[291:55.25]Dude, what the fuck is he doing?
[292:08.60]It's just so disorienting.
[292:11.92]That was the one too.
[292:13.34]It was just like he's so disorienting with his fucking wind shit.
[292:23.47]I didn't think he was going to do the one, two, three.
[292:25.25]I thought it was going to be two.
[292:28.47]Let's just bully him like right off the bat.
[292:34.94]OK.
[292:40.37]Bullshit.
[292:42.35]Bullshit.
[292:57.76]What are you doing?
[294:39.81]Oh!
[294:41.47]That goes behind him!
[296:12.23]Stupid shit on the screen!
[296:34.83]Nooo!
[296:36.21]I had it, but like, it was... It was there, but... Oh, I just didn't have enough heals.
[296:41.37]Ugh.
[296:42.88]I was going for the stagger.
[296:43.99]I thought I was going to get it.
[296:45.97]Damn.
[296:50.42]Oh, man.
[296:51.30]Okay.
[296:52.70]I'm getting it.
[296:53.28]I'm getting it.
[296:57.23]The ice is what's killing me.
[297:03.21]All the ice is just like, it spreads and it can hit you.
[297:07.67]I'm going to save Mambo for phase two.
[297:09.35]I think I can reliably get there.
[297:10.63]Okay, let's, that doesn't count.
[297:16.46]I really don't want to, I really don't want to sound like a broken record, but the lag is, it's like I'm playing with a fucking wet sock over my head.
[297:29.46]Like I have like a fucking bag over my face.
[297:38.72]I'm like playing with like a blindfold on.
[297:40.63]Alright, let's go.
[297:42.77]Oh, that was so close too.
[297:44.09]Oh, well.
[298:00.00]Ah, fuck.
[298:10.31]All your talismans are for spellcasting?
[298:12.39]That's also true, too.
[298:14.95]Although, not this one.
[298:15.65]This one's great.
[298:22.39]What should I put on instead?
[298:27.36]Um... It's been a long time since I've looked at any of these.
[298:31.70]Ooh!
[298:33.66]Why don't I put on, like, lightning damage reduction?
[298:37.82]That sounds pretty good.
[298:40.59]And cold.
[298:43.35]Non-physical.
[298:45.71]Or jump.
[298:46.21]Oh, yeah, the jump damage talisman.
[298:47.47]That's a good idea.
[298:50.47]Yep.
[298:52.87]What about enhancing skills?
[298:55.10]Because this is charge spells and skills, but... Moonveil is not... I don't think I'm charging it.
[299:14.60]Maybe poise.
[299:15.46]Should I just get a bunch of poise?
[299:19.36]Maybe the physical damage one.
[299:21.04]I need to just live longer, honestly.
[299:26.87]I'm actually not... I'm okay with this.
[299:30.89]Shard of Alexander?
[299:31.69]I don't think I have it on this character.
[299:40.51]I don't have it on this character, I don't think.
[299:43.73]I don't think we ever did that on stream, did we?
[299:44.85]Alright, let's try it again.
[300:04.14]I dodged that, I promise you.
[300:05.42]I thought he was going to bite.
[300:40.08]Shit see it's like so hard to tell when he does like that little just belly flop If he's gonna swing two or three more times So hard to tell
[300:53.38]He's still alive.
[300:59.99]Okay.
[301:03.13]There's a boss in front of me, apparently.
[301:05.08]Apparently.
[301:08.74]You are nothing without Mambo.
[301:19.03]I think Mambo, yeah, I think you got to get him out immediately.
[301:21.33]If he doesn't do the breath, no breath, good.
[301:48.16]Nice work, Mambo.
[301:49.92]Nice work, Mambo.
[302:04.60]Not again.
[302:05.26]Not again.
[302:06.93]I thought he was going to shoot the bolt.
[302:17.32]Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[302:18.96]Dude, we're good, we're good.
[302:19.86]Everything's fine.
[302:21.37]I'm still on the fucking stairs.
[302:27.61]This is a very bizarre thing going on.
[303:02.72]YO!
[303:47.88]Yes.
[303:49.74]Oh.
[303:53.85]Oh.
[303:55.97]Oh, my God.
[303:56.63]Mambo, you're my favorite friend ever.
[304:00.27]Mambo, you're the best.
[304:02.29]Mambo's the best.
[304:03.31]Everybody give it up for Mambo.
[304:09.46]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[304:10.50]That was a ton of fun.
[304:12.20]That was awesome.
[304:14.98]There's an item.
[304:18.36]Divine Beast Head.
[304:25.93]Cool.
[304:33.07]Ah.
[304:34.01]That was fun.
[304:40.16]Could I have done it without Mambo?
[304:42.88]Eh, maybe.
[304:45.34]But.
[304:46.66]just the summons in this game if they pull even one or two swings at the very end there right at the end he had his aggro on mambo he did one or two moves and then mambo went away and it was like I thought I was gonna die that last one two three chain I was like oh my god it's like this is it
[305:13.25]That was very hard.
[305:15.20]But that was really fucking fun.
[305:16.98]That was a great fight.
[305:25.76]I don't even know if that's the... Is this like... Is there even a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, whatever area?
[305:31.49]Or is it just going to go wherever you want?
[305:34.27]I feel like naturally people would just kind of go this way.
[305:37.75]Or maybe this way.
[305:43.52]Oh, right.
[305:43.78]I want to look at the item.
[305:45.50]What is the helmet?
[305:47.52]The music was really, really good there, too.
[305:49.82]Where is it?
[305:58.87]Divine Beast Head.
[306:02.46]This gives you strength and dex.
[306:05.12]A lot of strength, actually.
[306:07.73]Ritual headwear in the form of a divine beast's head.
[306:10.03]Used to perform the lion dance.
[306:11.93]Worn by the very finest of the sculpted keepers.
[306:15.31]Alas, it no longer responds to the old woman's earnest prayer.
[306:18.90]Divine invocation heightens intensity of the storm alongside strength and dexterity.
[306:23.80]It reduces the restorative effect of drinking from a flask.
[306:29.52]Focus is also troubled by this.
[306:38.96]four strength and what three three uh is it four and four wait hold on dex is yeah you get four and four I am am I playing Mario Kart what is this this is the goofiest shit ever
[307:17.18]I don't play online, because you're probably wondering, hey, why are there no signs anywhere?
[307:21.64]Why is nothing going on?
[307:23.62]Anytime a new FromSoftware game comes out, I like to just turn off all the stuff on the ground.
[307:28.15]Because I don't want, if I walk down the hallway and I see like two soap stones on the ground, soap signs, I'm like, okay, something's going on around that corner.
[307:35.83]So, I like to just go in totally without anything.
[307:40.17]But I can imagine you'll see this every day.
[307:44.59]Somebody will be literally invading you and they'll be wearing this.
[307:47.35]And they'll do, they're going to do stuff like this.
[307:49.67]They're going to do this.
[307:53.69]I mean, come on.
[308:00.53]Um, there's a remembrance.
[308:01.89]I haven't even been to the round table hold the entire stream.
[308:07.00]I forgot it existed.
[308:21.99]Oh, man.
[308:24.79]Raises potency of storms.
[308:29.51]It's a talisman.
[308:35.23]Raises potency of storms.
[308:36.19]Divine beasts are messengers of the heavens and their rage mirrors the tumult of the skies in which storms are pinnacle.
[308:42.69]Potency of storm?
[308:46.61]Lightning moves?
[308:47.51]Or what does that mean?
[308:50.37]Ash of War Divine Beast Frost Stomp.
[308:53.45]Oh, you get that crazy move.
[308:58.23]Divine Beast Frost Stomp, a skill which imitates the wrath of the Divine Beast Dance.
[309:01.48]Lift a leg up high and stamp it down with great force.
[309:05.76]Sends a powerful wave of frost straight out along the ground and can be charged to increase power.
[309:09.22]I don't know.
[309:15.07]I wonder what storms are.
[309:18.01]I'm going to take a quick break.
[309:19.69]I'm not done.
[309:20.55]I'm still here.
[309:22.30]I'm going to pee.
[309:22.66]I'm going to get some more of this Gatorade in here.
[309:24.74]I'll be right back.
[309:26.88]Stretch your legs.
[309:28.57]See you guys in a few minutes.
[317:12.45]I'm back.
[317:12.77]I had to get a chocolate.
[317:27.06]Delicious.
[317:30.06]How many deaths am I at?
[317:30.96]I haven't been keeping track.
[317:34.92]Maybe like three?
[317:45.93]What kind of chocolate?
[317:46.83]Only the best chocolate ever.
[317:47.95]Ferrero Rocher.
[317:59.76]Ferrero Rocher is so good.
[318:02.60]I might actually take a glasses break.
[318:07.02]After a while, when you wear glasses, those of you that don't wear them all day, every day, you can kind of start to feel crazy after a little while.
[318:16.41]Take a break for a little bit.
[318:19.97]Put him over here.
[318:22.85]Okay.
[318:25.58]Chad Ferrero fan?
[318:30.00]Yeah, it's one of the best.
[318:31.62]I think I'm not going to do any one of these yet.
[318:33.84]I'm going to hold on to it.
[318:38.13]Because I don't know what storms means.
[318:41.23]But I feel like it's possibly... Oh my god, I forgot I had this on.
[318:45.66]I feel like it's possibly one of the new kind of subclass things.
[318:50.07]Because they added a ton of subclasses or something, right?
[319:02.56]I have another interesting thought in question.
[319:06.62]I like the bug wing.
[319:07.58]The reason why I didn't use it last time is because it's plus nine.
[319:09.76]Yeah.
[319:13.59]But I only have one somber ancient dragon stone.
[319:16.63]I feel like I just don't.
[319:17.58]I just think I deal with it.
[319:19.30]Because there's definitely going to be at least a few int scaling weapons that drop here.
[319:28.34]I'll just save it.
[319:28.92]It's a good idea.
[319:36.25]Okay.
[319:39.17]What other cool stuff do I have?
[319:41.01]Oh, that was so cool.
[319:45.25]That was such a fun fight.
[319:48.93]I didn't even get mad.
[319:50.92]Actually, that's not that's that's a lie.
[319:59.74]Uh, I think I'm gonna put on the goofy helmet.
[320:03.14]Skids.
[320:05.18]Yeah, three intelligence.
[320:17.13]Kind of gets in the way, though.
[320:18.93]I'll try it for a while.
[320:20.49]Let me see if I can level up.
[320:23.71]Do I have enough to level up?
[320:28.07]This is cool, too.
[320:28.87]These little shadow runes.
[320:32.61]The Skadoo Tree is the shadow of the Erdtree.
[320:35.31]No wonder Grace shines ever so brilliantly.
[320:38.00]Skadoo Tree.
[320:47.35]title drop I'm imagining these just operate as these it's not like I have to hold on to them right
[321:11.57]Was the Garfield propaganda?
[321:12.77]I don't know, chat's, chat's having fun.
[321:15.79]Chat's being a little so- Ooh, wait, what, I forgot about this.
[321:22.57]Old currency used by Hornsend made by coating spiral horns with gold boosts the amount of ruins obtained from defeating enemies.
[321:29.91]It's kind of like the, the, what is it, the turtle thing?
[321:33.79]What's it called?
[321:36.66]You know what I'm talking about.
[321:37.70]Like, chicken foot, whatever, where is it?
[321:41.47]Do I not have any?
[321:50.93]Boost the amount of runes obtained from defeating enemies for a certain time.
[321:55.41]Boost the amount of runes obtained from enemies for a certain duration.
[321:58.13]It can also be sold for a high price.
[322:00.81]I wonder how much it sells for.
[322:01.75]Do we have any new dialog?
[322:10.53]Doesn't look like it.
[322:13.50]I need Great Grave Glovewort for the boys.
[322:17.95]I was breaking these.
[322:26.09]These are all just left over from the last time I streamed the game.
[322:37.86]Wait a minute.
[322:40.08]What was that?
[322:43.16]No, not this, but someone else.
[322:54.01]I think I need to discover more of the map.
[323:04.06]Wait a minute.
[323:06.38]Store room on the second floor.
[323:08.35]Wait, I want to go there.
[323:09.51]I'll do that after this.
[323:12.16]There's also the sewer too, right?
[323:15.99]Shit.
[323:16.37]Didn't do well.
[323:21.65]What are your opinions on Garfield?
[323:24.65]Because I haven't... I don't care.
[323:27.10]Garfield.
[323:28.98]Garfield?
[323:30.38]Was a new movie coming out?
[323:31.66]Maybe it'll be fun.
[323:32.42]I don't know.
[323:34.54]Go see it and tell me how it is.
[323:35.50]I ain't seen it.
[323:51.24]I think I'll get more bang for my buck with dexterity.
[323:55.92]Or shouldn't I have 60 bigger?
[324:04.41]Everyone is devastated apparently.
[324:05.89]You've changed.
[324:06.69]Devastated.
[324:08.37]I played Garfield Kart for 10 minutes.
[324:11.89]Ripped the cartridge out of the console and broke it in half.
[324:17.39]Why is this surprising to you?
[324:18.56]What are you talking about?
[324:27.06]I'll do Dex.
[324:40.19]It's funny that I put all these on and I did it like one or two tries later.
[324:45.72]That's funny.
[324:47.86]Let's get a good setup here though.
[324:50.02]I'm thinking max stamina vastly increased.
[324:58.91]I still do a lot of sorcery though.
[325:04.31]This one's cool.
[325:23.40]Yeah, I think that's fine.
[325:26.95]Do you still have the Garfield onesie or did you rip that in half too?
[325:32.48]I don't still have the Garfield onesie.
[325:35.26]I actually have no idea what the fuck even happened to it.
[325:45.03]I think I'm good.
[325:47.83]Jesus.
[325:49.61]I gotta fix my mic.
[325:51.37]I don't want to blow up your ears.
[326:18.95]We're good.
[326:23.51]Now the real question becomes, um, where do I want to go?
[326:29.36]I was at the Hallow tree and then I went to Ordenia and that's when we ended up down in the river.
[326:39.84]I think I have to go down here.
[326:45.21]Uh, actually I, um, how do I get to the DLC?
[326:51.23]Like, where, where is it?
[327:01.56]R1?
[327:01.76]Oh, okay.
[327:05.80]I see.
[327:06.66]Cool.
[327:06.80]Alright.
[327:09.54]I want to go...
[327:14.50]Where should I?
[327:15.24]Probably back.
[327:16.30]No.
[327:18.06]Back here.
[327:19.72]I got a key that opens a door up here somewhere.
[327:21.70]Second floor.
[327:29.21]Now the question is, is it this door?
[327:31.51]It's not.
[327:32.67]Or is it this one back here too?
[327:34.15]I think it's this one.
[327:41.69]Really?
[327:46.65]The sewer?
[327:53.25]Second floor.
[328:01.48]Go to the first Grace instead.
[328:02.96]I remember there was three.
[328:06.04]There was the sewer one that was locked.
[328:07.38]There was those two and then there was, was there one more?
[328:11.66]Read the key description.
[328:15.42]Yeah, but that means I have to press start and painfully move my thumb over to the thing that I have to... I can't.
[328:27.17]Even right now thinking about it is pissing me off.
[328:34.71]Okay.
[328:45.66]Okay.
[328:48.42]Ooh, cool.
[328:53.18]Oh, I never went over there.
[328:54.45]Dude, I ate a chocolate and it's like stuck in my esophagus.
[329:10.09]It's like, it won't, it's like lodged in there.
[329:30.72]This thing is so good.
[329:33.21]I'm sad.
[329:34.61]I remember looking at this.
[329:35.55]I remember asking everybody in the chat like a year ago.
[329:40.87]Like, are we doing bug?
[329:41.75]Are we doing baby rattle?
[329:43.61]And I think the pull actually was the bug wing one, but I just vetoed it and said we're doing the baby rattle and it was a mistake.
[329:53.96]Apologize.
[329:54.58]Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
[330:23.36]How dare you speak sacrilege about the baby rattle.
[330:31.74]I don't hate the baby rattle.
[330:35.83]It's just it's a flail.
[330:37.67]Flails are just kind of a pain in the ass.
[330:44.24]Actually, Babyrattle probably would have been better, technically, than Moonveil there, because I think flails have a lot more, like, poise and stagger damage.
[330:54.90]So, jump attacking his head, I probably would have gotten the staggers a lot faster.
[331:01.40]How many bosses have I downed so far?
[331:03.79]Technically, two or three, because the, I don't know if I would call the NPC invasion a boss, but
[331:14.04]Two.
[331:16.00]One main major boss and then one mausoleum.
[331:23.65]Lock doors that balcony with the casters behind the first race.
[331:38.60]Wait, how I'm trying to remember where that was.
[331:44.32]Was it back here?
[331:47.14]Private altar.
[331:52.76]Did I go too far?
[331:55.50]I have a lot of trouble remembering.
[331:59.95]Kind of like little things like that.
[332:01.57]And what is it down from here?
[332:02.45]I mean it did say second floor.
[332:11.85]Back this way probably.
[332:14.27]Oh, yep.
[332:15.21]I remember now.
[332:17.07]This one here.
[332:20.42]What is in here?
[332:21.02]NPC.
[332:56.26]OK.
[332:58.77]Should I put the head on and talk to him?
[333:03.83]That's what I would do right now.
[333:13.77]Look, it's me.
[333:21.25]Oh, such a joy to smell the scent again.
[333:26.40]Does a sculpted keeper stand before me?
[333:31.60]Oh, as I felt the sacred beast's essence fade, a great anxiety welled up within.
[333:41.87]forgive this old woman her foolish fears it is such relief I cannot express after an eternity of the mind the horns our voices have at last reached the heavens as evinced by thy gracious arrival oh
[334:12.37]I implore, vessel of the sacred beast, have my son accompany thee to war.
[334:19.99]And dance, I dance, of beauteous color.
[334:24.52]Take vengeance upon Mesmerity's lot.
[334:28.32]They who betrayed us, I, they who burned us, let them face in thy wrath their just deserts.
[334:39.05]My song will I sing.
[334:42.14]in service to thee watchful spirit oh sculpted keeper channel thy color into the most resplendent of dances my song will I sing in service to thee oh that's a a spell looks like a spell
[335:21.70]This is like fucking chocolate.
[335:23.46]Go down.
[335:30.46]We're good.
[335:38.69]She was just still talking.
[335:39.49]What the hell?
[335:46.74]Was she talking?
[335:47.62]I just missed whatever she was saying.
[335:55.05]Above the caster's head?
[335:56.33]Wait, it's just an item?
[336:01.64]Summon a guardian spirit.
[336:08.84]Did you eat one chocolate?
[336:10.78]And your whole life starts to crumble.
[336:20.02]It's like a little, it's like a little fucking hazelnut.
[336:34.21]Take vengeance on Messmer and his lot.
[336:37.19]They who betrayed us, I, they who burned us, let them face in thy wrath their just deserts.
[336:44.89]Give me one second.
[336:51.68]My mouse.
[337:00.33]What the hell is wrong with me?
[337:10.52]Okay.
[337:11.76]So it's a faith weapon, faith item.
[337:13.10]I can't use it, but that's kind of cool.
[337:16.66]So if I take this off in front of her, does she go, oh, you lied to me.
[337:21.49]You lied to me.
[337:21.99]Give it back.
[337:37.52]I do not match at all.
[337:38.58]And it's actually really annoying.
[337:41.32]I got to have some better drip than this.
[337:50.62]No.
[337:50.80]Nope.
[337:51.28]I kind of like it actually.
[337:54.61]Why do I look so frumpy?
[338:22.51]I look so frumpy like this.
[338:24.17]Why?
[338:24.49]It's the boots.
[338:28.87]I need to change them.
[338:48.18]Oh, just like loafers.
[338:52.97]This kind of goes real hard right now for me.
[339:04.94]It's like grandpa coming up to get like a milky way from the fucking pantry.
[339:16.54]Okay, is there anything else I can do in this room?
[339:29.59]Excuse me.
[339:30.61]Let's get a little bit of starlight in here so we can see a little bit better.
[339:35.18]Okay.
[339:39.82]I don't think there's anything else here.
[339:46.10]Cool.
[339:49.48]I want to check this place again.
[340:00.09]Interesting.
[340:06.57]How many souls did I even have?
[340:27.15]And who could forget?
[340:33.83]OK.
[340:35.55]Is there this more here?
[340:39.77]Even after the bus.
[340:45.26]I think this is the front door.
[340:57.83]Right now it's not the door.
[341:01.07]It's a different door.
[341:18.28]We keep going up?
[341:25.68]They did it again.
[341:26.22]Think you're gonna sneak that shit by me?
[341:58.15]Worth a shot.
[342:05.94]Worth a shot.
[342:31.58]Shadow tree, the skidoo tree.
[343:00.32]You put a broken thing in the fence.
[343:01.74]I'm gonna go look at it.
[343:02.79]It's just the way it is.
[343:11.52]This kind of looks like the bird tree entrance.
[343:14.58]Power of shadow message.
[343:25.39]Message left by Needle Knight Leda addressed to kindred spirits who also pursue Miquella's trail.
[343:31.98]The gate of divinity lies in the tower sealed by a shadow.
[343:35.00]That is surely where kind Miquella is headed.
[343:38.99]We are no Empyreans.
[343:40.75]We must locate the path that will lead us there.
[343:43.13]I will follow the crosses east.
[343:51.43]I feel like you could have put that on a sign instead of just kind of flopping it onto the ground.
[343:59.37]By the way, I feel like you also could have put that not 500 fucking meters up an unbelievably steep staircase.
[344:07.60]This could have been at the entrance.
[344:08.70]This could have been at the very bottom of the staircase.
[344:10.30]Okay, let's go all the way up here later.
[344:18.66]Drop a, like a fucking, like a Valentine on the ground.
[344:23.65]Whatever it is.
[344:30.97]No, you'd see a big, huge billboard.
[344:33.27]Should be down there.
[344:40.04]Not yet.
[344:42.68]This could have been an email.
[344:44.80]This could have been an email.
[344:51.50]This is re re re re re tarnished.
[344:56.48]Please respond.
[345:00.06]Sealed by obscure sealed and obscure by shadow.
[345:02.56]I wonder if this is.
[345:05.46]This looks like a massive arena.
[345:07.84]I feel like this is probably a major major major major major thing.
[345:13.67]Cool, OK.
[345:18.57]Well, I'm going up here.
[345:21.67]Get these.
[345:25.37]Um, hold on a second.
[345:27.61]What's this?
[345:30.45]Let's do that first.
[345:31.09]Let's start at five.
[345:42.65]Shpee.
[345:44.14]We got a shpee?
[345:49.06]Surprised we saw a shpee here.
[345:52.22]You know, you probably are amazing.
[345:58.17]And you probably could kill that thing by yourself.
[346:07.31]I think I might be the worst dressed streamer playing this game.
[346:13.13]And I wouldn't have it any other way.
[346:18.76]Ooh, big fire thing.
[346:20.70]Uh, yeah.
[346:21.02]Alright, we're gonna run into the fire thing.
[346:24.02]You actually are.
[346:25.56]You actually are.
[346:26.66]Should I just go attack this thing?
[346:40.52]Let's just see what it does.
[346:58.07]Holy shit.
[346:59.53]Okay.
[347:14.69]That was like a 3D movie from 2009.
[347:16.13]Okay.
[347:16.27]Okay.
[347:28.00]That was interesting.
[347:30.58]I think I have to stay on Torrent.
[347:37.93]This game is too scary.
[347:39.35]Play something else.
[347:46.22]Here.
[347:46.44]I found this up there.
[347:52.30]Do you want this?
[348:11.50]Alright.
[348:13.74]Let's just try to run to the back of the giant and go for slashes on the leg like every other giant in every video game that FromSoftware has ever made.
[348:25.31]That's including Kingsfield.
[349:07.74]He's got rocket ju- He's got rocket shoes!
[349:13.35]This is bad.
[349:22.42]I can't even hurt him.
[349:40.21]Shoot him in the face!
[349:57.53]I have to... I can't even imagine just being like a huge giant like that and you... Somebody is shooting like... Whoa!
[350:22.97]What is that?
[350:29.20]Exceedingly rare.
[350:31.45]Empyrean blood virgin?
[350:33.31]A young shoot, heavy with Empyrean blood.
[350:37.95]Sent a virgin forth from where the golden blood of Miquella, the wounded Empyrean.
[350:42.03]The wounded Empyrean.
[350:44.57]Wounded Empyrean.
[350:45.37]I don't think we're going to fight that giant, by the way.
[350:52.07]Wounded Empyrean.
[351:00.03]But yeah, just imagine fighting this little shit running around on a horse and you're like, get away from me.
[351:05.20]He gets behind you and he starts like shooting fucking icicles like, like into, into your ass.
[351:12.36]It's like, what the fuck is, like, get at it.
[351:15.36]What the fuck are you doing?
[351:18.52]Just like, it's like, bro.
[351:23.55]Like, I'm going to stomp this little fucker.
[351:30.34]What did I just come back to?
[351:32.28]I was... I died.
[351:44.39]What is this?
[351:44.83]Dude's off his rocker.
[351:58.23]oh fuck okay hold on alright this time don't aim like aim for his he just killed like 10 people I don't know who's doing in the face I don't think it's I don't think I can that was crazy looking I don't you can't kill these things okay I'm just gonna avoid it completely I just I tried to avoid it completely what up
[352:33.46]He's making the game scarier on purpose.
[352:37.38]I actually tried to avoid him.
[352:39.36]You saw.
[352:40.14]I actually tried to avoid him.
[352:43.33]No, you're going to get a... This is going to be a weapon you get where you can shoot a giant crossbow bolt through his head.
[352:59.91]I'm not...
[353:02.78]I'm not aggroing him.
[353:04.74]I'm deliberately going all the way around.
[353:06.34]I was already over there.
[353:16.39]Okay.
[353:23.23]Successfully have gone completely around the entire map to avoid this guy.
[353:27.27]Scorched ruins.
[353:28.21]Wait a minute.
[353:28.71]Have I been here?
[353:29.73]Yes, I have.
[353:30.78]This is the first thing I did.
[353:42.55]How did I miss this?
[353:44.25]How did I miss this Grace?
[353:46.78]Your voice is kind of weird right now.
[353:53.40]I need two.
[354:00.21]Alright.
[354:04.35]But I could go over here.
[354:07.39]No, stick with the plan.
[354:18.77]I had 50,000.
[354:19.57]Come on, Torrent.
[354:32.08]Interesting.
[354:33.76]Hello.
[354:48.46]What do these guys look like?
[354:49.26]Let me see their faces.
[355:01.24]They have long noses.
[355:06.72]Are those like cloth drapes?
[355:08.34]I think it's cloth.
[355:36.63]Backhand blade.
[355:37.69]That's a great four.
[355:43.34]Backhand blade.
[355:44.88]Strength dex.
[355:46.06]Just like a dex strength weapon.
[355:48.43]Curve blade wielded with a backhand grip.
[355:50.93]A type of weapon wielded by a horn set for generations.
[355:54.25]Style of combat associated with this weapon is marked by spinning slashes and gouging thrusts.
[355:59.12]Blind spot.
[356:05.64]That skill seems crazy.
[356:08.06]Hold on.
[356:09.12]Is it a kind of a sidestep backstab?
[356:29.96]Whoa, oh you hold you do hold it backwards.
[356:37.91]I think this too.
[356:40.03]There is.
[356:49.30]You can dash either direction.
[356:50.56]You can dash forward.
[356:51.40]You can dash sideways.
[356:52.42]This seems amazing.
[356:55.50]Is there a follow up?
[356:59.34]Doesn't seem like there's a follow-up.
[357:08.04]Get out of here.
[357:09.26]I'm just practicing.
[357:10.34]Get away from me.
[357:17.52]I know a weapon in PvP that's going to be really annoying to have to play against.
[357:24.66]It's this one.
[357:30.59]It's this one.
[357:36.67]Curve swords?
[357:39.99]He's studying the blade.
[357:42.05]Looks easy to dodge.
[357:47.09]It does, but if you dodge backwards and I come forward, is it... Because that is really fast.
[357:56.55]If you dodge backwards and I come out, I actually might be able to get you.
[358:02.01]Just seems really quick, but that's really cool.
[358:06.53]I want to see an INT weapon.
[358:09.35]Eventually a little item, a little trinket to collect.
[358:16.86]I'm going to mark it because I got it.
[358:27.11]OK.
[358:31.09]Let's check this out up here.
[358:34.05]Oh, you know what?
[358:34.67]Let me.
[358:37.89]Am I going to die if I go down here?
[358:38.93]I kind of want to see what's in this river.
[358:39.97]I think it's too far.
[358:47.73]It's way too far.
[358:49.94]There's no way I make that jump either.
[358:52.40]Pretty.
[358:55.70]That's far away, but wow.
[359:07.49]Where is this painting?
[359:10.22]Because I see these arches around down here.
[359:26.51]And the big bridge.
[359:30.80]Where's that bridge?
[359:32.76]Down there?
[359:44.08]Down there somewhere.
[359:44.76]Something going on down there.
[359:52.95]Oh, brave glove wart.
[360:02.45]Good, OK.
[360:06.12]Wow, that is so pretty.
[360:08.62]It's so pretty over there.
[360:32.97]I love this big open field of, what is this, wheat?
[360:39.84]Alright.
[360:42.26]I kind of want to go across.
[360:44.25]But there's shit over here.
[360:46.53]Let's go do the shit over here.
[360:59.65]That's just grass?
[361:02.25]Nevada man?
[361:08.70]No, that's wheat.
[361:09.78]Look, it's wheat.
[361:14.18]See?
[361:18.37]It's wheat.
[361:21.69]I know wheat when I see it, I grow it.
[361:26.19]One strand of it in a pot.
[361:30.71]What I do is I make like a teaspoon of flour.
[361:33.66]I sprinkle it into my cookies or whatever would be funny.
[361:47.81]Savage Lion Claw, Ashen Roar.
[361:55.67]Almost out forward.
[361:56.45]Striking foes with armament.
[361:57.69]An additional strike.
[361:58.37]Feels like they leaned into the ashes of war.
[362:00.91]Because some of these seem crazy.
[362:02.83]This is safe to go down.
[362:22.32]And I want to do it.
[362:23.20]So I'm going to do it.
[362:39.13]What wicked embarrassing noise did I do like three hours ago?
[362:41.43]Anybody remember?
[362:53.79]Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.
[363:00.54]He sounded like, oh yeah, it was what I did.
[363:04.10]Somebody said I sounded like Krusty the Clown.
[363:06.58]It wasn't Krusty the Clown.
[363:07.46]It was Mr. Dink.
[363:11.65]And that actually did sound like Rusty the Clown.
[363:15.75]I can't do it again because I'm not doing it again, right?
[363:18.55]You'll never get that ever again.
[363:19.59]There's only one more time you'll ever get that and it's if me and Vinny are in a call together.
[363:27.19]That's the only other time that will ever happen.
[363:30.23]Period.
[363:32.09]And I think that was the only other time it happened.
[363:34.63]Period.
[363:39.66]Battle realm.
[363:40.30]Majestic bird.
[363:58.93]There it is.
[363:59.25]I think this is it.
[364:02.77]Yep.
[364:07.16]It's right here somewhere.
[364:08.54]Right here.
[364:23.80]A little to the left.
[364:30.18]Right here.
[364:31.90]Where is it?
[364:37.31]Up on the rock, maybe?
[364:43.11]I'm so close.
[364:49.21]There you are.
[364:50.22]Cool.
[364:52.84]Got it.
[364:55.88]What do I get?
[364:58.44]Serpent Crest Shield.
[365:04.66]Strength.
[365:06.84]100% physical.
[365:07.38]Not a whole lot of magic defense at all.
[365:08.88]A finely made red shield featuring an engraving of a winged serpent.
[365:14.41]Excels at guarding against fire.
[365:16.87]Oh, it does.
[365:17.29]It's 63.
[365:17.43]It's said to have been made to commemorate the beginnings of the crusade started by Messmer, son of Marika.
[365:32.64]crusade from a Messmer.
[365:38.14]Interesting.
[365:41.35]Some goofy shit going on in this game.
[365:44.97]Cool, alright.
[365:46.61]Got the painting.
[365:50.01]Really nice view.
[365:58.03]I don't.
[365:59.01]Yeah, I don't think that's doable.
[366:02.31]No.
[366:06.20]I thought this was a pool of water.
[366:08.00]I think it's just a gigantic hole.
[366:10.12]That's all it is.
[366:11.68]I think the water is over there.
[366:18.42]Can I get a birthday beatbox?
[366:28.06]There.
[366:33.44]By the way, my fee is $500 an hour.
[366:37.03]So that was... Four and a half seconds.
[366:45.01]I think you owe me 40 cents.
[366:56.24]Not on your birthday.
[366:57.34]Not on your... No, not on your birthday.
[367:00.04]Ooh.
[367:11.58]This is where I want to go into the water.
[367:17.12]Let me guess.
[367:19.12]Oh, a gill.
[367:19.86]Oh, a gill.
[367:22.13]Is that an enemy or is it just a root coming out of the ground?
[367:36.02]Oh, Egil.
[367:37.78]Come on.
[367:38.70]Where are you?
[367:40.32]Yeah, it's this pile of... It's this pile of trash right here.
[367:44.58]This is going to stand up.
[367:47.24]You think this is just debris?
[367:48.38]Nope.
[367:48.74]It's... Yep.
[367:49.88]I told you.
[367:50.46]I knew.
[367:50.86]I've played this game a thousand times.
[367:53.40]I told you.
[367:54.20]It's Egil.
[367:55.52]Ghost Flame Dragon.
[367:56.70]Let's go.
[367:59.12]He's cool looking.
[368:01.68]Oh, I do not hurt this thing at all.
[368:14.81]We're going to be here awhile.
[368:29.86]That's more like it.
[368:43.71]I don't have enough mana for this.
[368:59.86]Does that mean that there is more dragon communion spells?
[369:10.92]You're losing your beatbox ability.
[369:12.34]You need an air to succeed you.
[369:16.02]Guys.
[369:18.77]I just got to tell you.
[369:20.59]In the world of beatboxing.
[369:23.67]I have training wheels on.
[369:26.73]And I am riding around the living room.
[369:30.96]Okay.
[369:33.74]There's.
[369:35.14]There are far.
[369:37.12]I'm not even on the playing field.
[369:43.56]I know all your resentment lingers yet the raw stuff from which I shall surely forge a curse upon the dastard Messmer's head upon marika's children each and all
[370:03.92]You hate both Messmer and Marika.
[370:07.56]I know all your resentment lingers yet.
[370:08.99]The raw stuff from which I shall surely forge a curse.
[370:12.75]But upon the dastard Messmer's head, upon Marika's children each and all.
[370:24.47]Sitting here looking at this tree.
[370:36.81]I know the thing with the omens is they were shunned, right?
[370:40.79]Put down into the shunning grounds.
[370:44.36]It was like an embarrassment, right?
[370:48.08]That's kind of the theory.
[370:50.58]So, interesting to see this.
[370:52.86]What the hell was that?
[370:55.05]I didn't know it was going to come all the way.
[371:14.05]Yeah, Morgott's an omen, but... They have to shave their horns off, too.
[371:19.99]That's fucked up.
[371:22.02]You have runes.
[371:29.44]This game is so weird because, you know, like, oh, Horilu.
[371:31.51]Oh, no, that's Godfrey.
[371:34.15]It's Godfrey now.
[371:37.29]And it's like everyone kind of has to... Golden Order comes in and it's like, oh no, everybody is no longer the person that you were before.
[371:44.50]Now you're Godfrey of the Golden Order.
[371:46.58]Like, oh, okay.
[371:48.02]I guess I am.
[371:50.76]And now they're like under the control of the Golden Order.
[371:52.92]And then like being Hoarah Loux is you not being under the control.
[371:56.26]I don't know.
[371:56.58]There's a lot going on.
[372:00.82]I'm very interested in if they give any kind of
[372:06.62]The who and the why, I think, is important.
[372:09.08]That we don't really have.
[372:12.33]We have the who, but we don't really have the why and the how.
[372:19.73]Sorry, I just walked in a circle and talked about how cool the game was.
[372:24.16]I will get back on track.
[372:42.82]Alright, where am I off to?
[372:43.80]I can't look at the map.
[372:55.81]There we go.
[372:58.11]I think it's time to either go up here or... Yeah, let's just go right over there.
[373:06.08]Died by the ghost dragon.
[373:16.74]Feels like the performance has drastically improved out here.
[373:20.58]Remember a few of like four or five hours ago when I was walking around out here?
[373:25.53]It was like, it was, it was like I was playing at 30 FPS.
[373:29.41]I think the shaders have compiled by now.
[373:52.04]also too I don't I know it doesn't need to be said but people if you want to like if people like that want a theory craft like that's fine I'm just like oh I think that Messmer um is a god from um Venus that's fine but if but I would just ask you just don't you know if you somehow know anything please don't um you know spoil it and chat or anything and mods please you could be on top of it
[374:19.72]I don't think anybody's doing that.
[374:21.84]As everybody here seems to be pretty well behaved.
[374:24.14]It seems pretty good.
[374:29.13]I would just say be careful when you're on the internet over the next few days.
[374:34.01]Especially over the next 48 hours.
[374:36.03]I don't know how it hurts from very tip to toe.
[374:44.56]Help me, I must ask.
[374:45.64]Am I human still?
[374:47.62]Is that the reason I yet suffer so?
[374:53.92]Human.
[374:57.70]How about in mushrooms?
[375:00.87]Fungus or something.
[375:07.33]If you're human, you're getting like punished down here?
[375:22.13]Cool to see that's just, I was up there.
[375:25.09]Just walking around.
[375:28.97]You know what I would love?
[375:31.19]I don't even know if this is possible.
[375:33.37]To mod this.
[375:35.91]But one of the things that I've really, really, really loved about Breath of the Wild.
[375:45.26]Hold that thought.
[375:55.21]Is that kind of hero's journey feature?
[375:59.33]Where you could see, I almost just wish I could look down at like a map or something and just see me run around and doing all this shit.
[376:06.58]I think it'd be really fun to get like a feature like that.
[376:11.55]It's like, here's where you died.
[376:12.49]Here's where you died again and again and again and again and again.
[376:14.86]That hero's journey thing is actually really cool.
[376:18.46]In a game like Elden Ring, in a game, any FromSoftware game, I feel like it'd be really funny and fun to kind of watch that back.
[376:27.78]You can see kind of the hot zones of where your character died the most.
[376:31.00]I feel like it'd be fun.
[376:35.09]I don't know if that's possible or anything or what you would need to do that, but.
[376:44.22]Oops.
[376:46.01]Well, it's shiny.
[376:46.61]It's fine.
[377:04.00]Didn't go around here.
[377:23.25]That move is so good.
[377:24.21]That move can hit so many times.
[377:25.71]I think there are mosquitoes.
[377:43.45]They don't have the... Are they?
[377:44.83]I think they're just weird wasps.
[377:50.86]Yeah, it's a wasp, I think.
[377:53.66]Stinger.
[378:04.48]So cool.
[378:11.28]Alright, do you feel like it stinks down here, or do you feel like it smells nice?
[378:35.91]Get him with the backswing?
[378:36.87]Damn.
[378:39.71]Think I can upgrade this now?
[378:52.27]Maybe?
[378:52.55]No.
[378:52.73]Let's hop off the horse for this.
[379:08.37]Oh!
[379:15.62]I was far too confident there apparently.
[379:22.12]You're sweating a lot, so it probably smells horrible.
[379:26.46]I don't smell.
[379:27.54]Sorry.
[379:44.67]Uh, ailing village.
[379:45.87]Okay, let's do this the right way.
[380:05.73]It was a person in here.
[380:07.38]They were walking out.
[380:15.10]I'm not crazy, right?
[380:15.70]There was a person walking around.
[380:20.30]Oh, it was up higher.
[380:31.02]Why mold?
[380:31.88]I watch your streams at times two and a half times speed.
[380:44.43]I feel like for every stream or every piece of media that you watch at, like, times two or three times speed, you need to read a book.
[380:53.16]You need at least a 200-page book to counteract what that's doing to your brain.
[380:57.57]You know what I mean?
[380:59.47]Like, I feel like you... That's a lot of info to take in.
[381:03.75]I feel like you need to, like, sit.
[381:06.03]I'm going to die again.
[381:12.32]true yeah oh my I don't need I don't have I don't have time to drink I gotta run I'm dead again okay alright so these guys are dead aren't you the guy that watches Adam sandler movies in 10 minute increments yeah um I'm avoiding lots of damage
[381:40.81]I watch movies.
[381:41.89]I watched five minute increments of a movie.
[381:44.31]Skip.
[381:45.33]That's like 40 minutes of damage that I'm not getting.
[381:56.29]Damage.
[381:59.55]I do this with a lot of movies.
[382:01.47]Only movies.
[382:01.91]Okay.
[382:03.05]Let me tell you.
[382:03.49]I have sung the praises of Adam Sandler many times.
[382:12.23]Adam Sandler is... Let's just redo the whole thing because I know that some of you might not have heard it.
[382:17.87]Adam Sandler makes a bunch of just, like, just shit movies that are just, like, goofy.
[382:21.71]And he just is like, you know, whatever.
[382:22.71]I don't give a fuck.
[382:23.29]I'm just gonna make a movie and it's gonna be stupid and crazy.
[382:26.19]And then he'll do uncut gems and, like, win a fucking Grammy.
[382:33.32]An Emmy.
[382:34.38]An Oscar.
[382:35.64]A Golden Globe.
[382:37.44]One of those.
[382:37.92]The latter, I think, is the right one.
[382:53.24]and he kind of just could do that just just to just to remind everybody just to remind you all just who the fuck he is like oh Adam sandler sucks he's oh his movies are fucking stupid and then he does uncut gems and it's like
[383:12.40]Oh my God, he's a fucking talented genius.
[383:18.56]And then he gets to go, yep, I'm going to go make a movie where a guy shits his pants five times.
[383:23.66]Which is my kind of movie.
[383:27.79]I'm not putting up with these.
[383:29.27]We're just doing this.
[383:30.75]Yep, goodbye.
[383:31.43]I don't even know what I killed, but it died.
[383:37.57]I only saw one clip from that movie and his acting was terrible.
[383:48.23]You saw one clip.
[383:52.60]You know how many people have seen one clip from this stream and they go, I ain't ever going to that stream.
[383:57.25]That stream sucks.
[383:59.07]Are you going to be that guy here?
[384:05.06]You know how many one clips circulated this stream that I look at and I go, wow, really, that really is fucking irritating that that's a clip that just circulates every 15 fucking days.
[384:15.19]And then you see people like, oh, wow, these guys are kind of a fucking tool.
[384:18.55]And it's like, oh, you just Adam Sandler'd me.
[384:28.02]There's probably one clip in any movie that sucks.
[384:30.10]That's true, yeah.
[384:31.52]Like, if you get a clip of somebody just, like, eating a steak, like... If that's the only clip that you saw from The Godfather, it'd be like, well, The Godfather's not a good movie.
[384:43.95]Like, I saw this one clip, and he ate a piece of steak, and it was terrible.
[384:47.27]Like, who watches that?
[384:56.31]You look like a painting.
[384:57.33]I don't even know if that was about me.
[384:59.27]You might have been replying to somebody.
[385:00.69]But how would you even know what they... I don't know.
[385:03.39]I'm getting a little lost here.
[385:04.49]Let's go.
[385:06.49]Big waterfall.
[385:15.98]Hey.
[385:17.12]That is a dangerous journey.
[385:19.66]But it's a journey we're going to take.
[385:21.10]Okay.
[385:30.09]I think I've done everything here.
[385:31.31]Unless there's... Is there anything else in here?
[385:32.76]I think I got everything.
[385:41.94]This was a nice, like, walk around in looking houses I've looked in five times, but talk part of the stream.
[385:47.48]That was fun.
[385:51.64]Hmm.
[385:52.56]Interesting.
[385:56.70]I already got that.
[385:57.32]Yeah, I got it.
[385:57.84]Okay.
[385:58.22]Let's, um...
[386:03.21]I feel like I didn't get a chance to look.
[386:04.85]I got the dragon spawned or woke up so.
[386:07.70]Let me go check that out.
[386:12.52]Another hut down here.
[386:41.69]Ooh.
[386:45.93]Fly pot.
[386:49.40]What are these other things?
[386:50.18]Oh, I got a talisman.
[386:53.14]Talisman depicting a soul taken by sickness.
[386:56.02]When certain ailments are triggered, this talisman grants resistance to the same ailment.
[387:02.69]When the weak were infected with the dreaded fly sickness, they perished well before the metamorphosis could take hold.
[387:09.40]Oddly, those who cared for the infected and made certain they were given a proper burial were never afflicted themselves.
[387:19.80]Weird.
[387:24.06]Man flies are what those things are called.
[387:33.41]Where's my pot?
[387:34.37]I have to craft it.
[387:42.25]Oil pot.
[387:44.13]Poison.
[387:45.44]What is it?
[387:50.30]My pot.
[387:50.86]Am I missing something?
[388:02.87]Eat the fly mold.
[388:06.36]Ew.
[388:15.80]Oh, it's hefty fly pot.
[388:17.34]I'm just looking for fly pot.
[388:21.26]Throw at enemies to release a large form of blood flies.
[388:24.75]Arcane scaling.
[388:27.22]that's kind of a crazy build just make a shitload of hefty fly pots dump a hundred points in arcane and just throw bugs at people cool
[388:55.77]How we doing?
[388:57.85]Oh, right.
[388:58.47]This way.
[389:04.37]Don't aggro the dragon.
[389:23.03]Something over here.
[389:26.94]Did I already do this?
[389:27.56]I think I went up here already.
[389:32.34]Did I come up here?
[389:33.04]I thought I came up here.
[389:51.55]What's that?
[389:56.51]Ooh, okay, cool.
[389:57.85]I got something.
[390:00.69]I got something.
[390:09.20]Dungeon.
[390:24.59]That was a long walk.
[390:26.29]Bellaroot Jail.
[390:27.75]Is this too much for me?
[390:38.65]Are you in the DLC area?
[390:39.91]Yes, I am.
[390:41.67]If you think I'm playing in Limgrave, I would run immediately.
[390:47.79]I'm going to give you five seconds to make sure you don't see anything you don't want to see.
[390:53.29]Four.
[391:00.74]Holy shit.
[391:01.54]Well, hopefully, hopefully you stuck around for at least this part.
[391:10.30]Cool.
[391:15.22]What the hell?
[391:19.25]You missed your cue by about 10 feet.
[391:27.76]That guy was so raring to kill somebody, he just.
[391:37.01]Oh, it's this guy.
[391:40.69]Frozen maggot.
[391:44.49]What are these frozen maggots?
[391:52.56]Maggots develop in great jar innards and are invaluable source of sustenance to the prisoners.
[392:01.80]Is this what's in the jars?
[392:03.48]Is this what actually ends up in the jars?
[392:05.94]Kind of cool if I went through that.
[392:33.04]You knew they were gonna do it at least once.
[392:59.13]you scared me that's a nice face reaction for a youtube video oh you mean the youtube videos where it's and you mean all the youtube videos where I I look I'll I'll find videos of myself of you know whether it's the um like whether whatever channel it's on and it's me going that just you can well you're gonna don't use that one because that one wasn't very good
[393:26.49]I'm always so sweaty, too.
[393:28.05]It's like the contrast between the shine on my face and whatever is in the background when I get cut out and superimposed as the thumbnail.
[393:36.03]Because I don't do this shit.
[393:37.71]I don't, like, take 200 photos of my face, like, in a high-definition area.
[393:44.38]It's a cutout from the webcam.
[393:47.04]And I always look like shit in every single one of these thumbnails.
[393:51.64]Because I have never done the, like... Hmm...
[393:57.04]Like, I've never done that before in front of like a good camera.
[394:05.15]So all you get is any frame, a freeze frame of me greasy and sweat.
[394:11.42]My hair looks like shit.
[394:12.64]And I'm just like, I just, I look awful, but you ain't never going to find me taking those photos fucking ever.
[394:35.21]This place is so... Wait, can I attack that?
[394:44.78]You need professional selfies.
[394:48.00]No, I can't do it.
[394:50.89]I can't do it.
[394:53.37]I just, I can't.
[394:55.15]I don't know what it, I just, it is, I am like, it is like, it reviles me.
[394:59.93]Like, I just, I can't do it.
[395:13.36]Interesting.
[395:20.55]I didn't know there was a guy there.
[395:25.74]I was trying to smash through this grate.
[395:27.28]We're going to play Dark and Darker again.
[395:39.15]I checked it out actually after it came back to Steam.
[395:44.33]A lot has changed.
[395:46.17]I was running around and I was just like, what is going on?
[395:47.93]Why does this game feel so different?
[395:55.21]and it's mainly because um it's there's no more like battle royale circle and I I was like what's going on this thing feels so different it's quite different yeah and now there's static exit points and I don't know it feels like um I would need to get used to it
[396:21.61]The core game is still very, very fun and hilarious and goofy.
[396:25.52]And there's a lot of fun items to collect.
[396:27.16]I love that aspect.
[396:29.52]But I think it's not that I wanted it to be a BR.
[396:36.11]But it kind of feels like you're... Can't open this right now.
[396:41.91]It feels like you're going there to get items and just kind of try to get out.
[396:45.51]And I feel like the encounters that you run into with people now is... Look, I only played it for a handful of hours, right?
[396:53.40]Maybe a few hours total.
[396:55.44]And it felt like I was... I gotta go get a bunch of shit and I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[397:00.24]And you might not even see anybody.
[397:02.32]But that's a kind of fun too, though.
[397:05.08]that like the PVE aspect is actually kind of what I preferred anyways so I feel like I would probably like it a lot if I just continue to play it I won't ever do it again I swear a living Saint I'll surely be please you must forgive me forgive me please what was that first part oh please not the jar anything but that I promise I won't ever do it again
[397:34.06]Do they like mush people up and put them into the jars?
[397:37.48]I think that's what's implied.
[397:38.62]That's what Alexander says, right?
[397:42.02]Alexander eats people during Redan's fight on the ground.
[397:45.77]He's like, I will be a great warrior.
[397:48.21]There are lots of great warriors on this battlefield.
[397:50.63]I will eat them all.
[398:09.33]Yep.
[398:10.29]I knew that's what I was going to do.
[398:12.98]Eventually.
[398:20.72]Hold on, though.
[398:23.72]I hear this music playing.
[398:30.49]That was kind of scary music, wasn't it?
[398:31.79]Ah!
[398:49.71]This is what's in the jars?
[398:51.01]I was always under the assumption that it was kind of just, like, liquid?
[399:21.16]Anytime you destroy one of these jars or you kill them, they kind of just liquid just burst out.
[399:25.46]I thought it was just a pot full of goo, not a guy.
[399:28.13]That's crazy.
[399:39.75]Okay.
[399:40.45]Well, cool.
[399:41.05]I guess we get the reveal of what is actually in the jars.
[399:47.41]These weird... The legs go through the legs and the arms go through the arms.
[399:52.77]And then there are these weird jello blob muscle tissue people.
[400:08.82]Well, down we go.
[400:21.11]Which one is going to fall?
[400:22.29]That's the real question.
[400:24.89]One of these is going to fall down.
[400:26.43]And it's probably going to be this one.
[400:28.99]I overshot it.
[400:29.77]No, I didn't.
[400:35.34]Is this a roll or is this a jump?
[400:36.84]I think it's a roll.
[400:41.38]Glad I was right.
[400:52.47]Boss of this dungeon probably going to be a jar.
[400:56.47]Would make sense to me.
[400:57.49]I'm going to go ahead and put this on.
[401:09.02]Last.
[401:13.60]My goodness.
[401:19.92]Why did I dodge into his hand?
[401:39.29]Frost.
[401:40.61]Another one out of the jar.
[402:08.35]Oops.
[402:10.75]Holy shit.
[402:12.01]I don't know if I did that or if he did.
[402:14.01]I don't have the gravity meteorite stick on anymore.
[402:36.29]I want to get a good look at their face.
[402:42.98]I really want to see what their face looks like.
[402:44.92]Close up.
[402:48.34]No more six hour streams.
[402:50.48]Yeah, but this is kind of an exception, you know.
[402:58.36]This is Elden Ring.
[403:08.12]Oh.
[403:27.50]This dungeon is massive too.
[403:29.26]Usually they're pretty small and usually they're a handful of corridors and then a couple of little puzzle things to do.
[403:34.84]Oh my goodness.
[403:38.20]Uh, bro, you got that on wrong.
[403:39.63]It's like putting your pants on inside out.
[403:51.75]Oh, that hurts a lot.
[403:54.09]I got really cocky there for no reason.
[403:59.64]Holy shit.
[404:09.36]You need to help him get dressed.
[404:17.56]I have a feeling this is going to kill me if I'm not.
[404:19.78]I gotta be not stupid here.
[404:43.65]Damn.
[404:45.83]Lot of jars.
[404:53.81]Don't I'm going to die.
[404:57.69]Oh, no!
[404:58.71]I wanted to go over there.
[404:59.63]I think I have to jump over that.
[405:01.01]I wanted to go over there.
[405:29.18]I hear twinkling.
[405:30.08]I think I missed a cookie bug.
[405:36.63]Did I miss a cookie bug?
[405:39.21]Oh boy.
[405:53.57]Did you come out of a jar?
[406:06.36]Great.
[406:13.73]I have to hit everything now.
[406:17.88]Because there's no way to tell if one of them is going to get up.
[406:19.62]Okay, I think I can go up.
[406:38.48]Yep.
[406:41.28]Oh no!
[406:50.48]That's sad.
[406:54.96]I'm devastated.
[406:58.92]Can I get up a different way?
[406:59.76]Uh, not really.
[407:06.03]Ah.
[407:08.75]Maybe I can.
[407:09.49]I think I can still get up.
[407:23.26]This has a ladder, but... You need to jump right at the end.
[407:27.04]Okay.
[407:33.37]You know, I've never used those once.
[407:37.29]I've played through this game five or six, maybe seven times.
[407:41.56]And I don't even know what they do.
[407:44.72]It duplicates an Ash of War?
[407:47.24]Would you do that to put it on a dual-weld scenario?
[407:50.32]No?
[407:57.46]Are you finished with the DLC?
[407:58.80]Oh, not even close.
[408:00.84]Some would argue I just started it.
[408:02.30]Alright, don't get lost in the jar maze.
[408:07.70]I have places to be.
[408:08.52]Okay, look.
[408:12.83]Item over there.
[408:13.89]Get a good vantage point.
[408:15.55]So it's straight and then right and wrap around.
[408:44.12]OK.
[408:52.14]I really wish I didn't break that ladder.
[408:53.80]As you go from there to what to there to there to there or is that just bait?
[409:37.29]Any more ladders that I wait?
[409:38.71]Hold on, it was great.
[409:40.39]Hey, alright, no, we're good, we're good.
[409:54.05]That jar is open.
[409:59.32]Inner meat.
[410:14.25]You gotta rev it up sometimes.
[410:26.56]My fingers, my hands are so sweaty.
[410:28.12]They just fell off.
[410:49.36]Look at the tops.
[411:06.29]Ooh.
[411:10.25]It's like put a bunch of decomposing bodies in these.
[411:13.11]Yeah, that's just.
[411:16.13]That is gross.
[411:22.10]I would not go swimming in this pool.
[411:26.66]I think that's nothing else, right?
[411:31.70]I think that's it.
[411:33.85]I love these little candles.
[411:36.29]You know what I really want to get into?
[411:39.81]Old ass wax candles like that.
[411:43.63]I want some.
[411:47.65]I just realized my webcam is...
[411:54.28]Really, really wacky.
[412:06.69]Yeah, it is.
[412:08.61]It's been desynced?
[412:12.68]It's not desynced.
[412:13.52]It just kind of looks like ass.
[412:16.78]Hold on.
[412:19.00]Oh, I don't know what I just did.
[412:23.24]Oh, right.
[412:23.92]I'm in exclusive.
[412:25.79]I'm not in.
[412:27.31]Okay, hold on a second.
[412:30.69]I actually might be able to fix it.
[412:32.05]We might get a little dimmer, though.
[412:33.21]Let's see what happens.
[412:54.72]Is that better?
[412:55.06]I actually think this actually might improve it if I go like this.
[413:04.75]Hey, look, I'm in full 60 FPS now.
[413:25.28]I think I just crashed Elden Ring.
[413:30.57]No, we're good.
[413:32.63]We're good?
[413:33.09]We're good.
[413:36.01]Welcome back to high quality.
[413:43.90]Thought I could make it.
[413:45.20]I think I got everything.
[413:48.72]I'll make my way out of this room.
[414:01.12]freezing pot you can throw meat at people to hurt them this is what becomes of the condemned who get sliced up and stuffed into jars to become saints instead they're putting prisoners in here
[414:28.84]So you, you get like sentenced and they stuff you into a jar and you decompose in the jar with dozens if not hundreds of other people and you become this thing.
[414:56.22]Got a lot of runes.
[414:58.34]Thank God I jumped.
[415:20.34]What were you guarding?
[415:23.10]Nothing.
[415:26.17]You were just creepy.
[415:41.42]All the way.
[415:43.02]No.
[415:50.30]Up and around.
[415:54.89]Where is the exit here?
[416:07.17]I think that's the entrance.
[416:11.43]Oh no, I'm trapped in the jar maze.
[416:13.07]I'm not getting out.
[416:29.55]This is the entrance.
[416:33.33]Then... This way?
[416:36.79]It's Hitman 3 all over again.
[416:38.23]Yeah, there I. OK, blink two times.
[416:44.26]OK.
[417:21.38]I'm kind of running low here.
[417:22.48]I got to be careful.
[417:23.34]This is a far run.
[417:25.75]There's no shortcut.
[417:26.49]I just kind of waltz down here.
[417:28.27]Okay.
[417:43.04]raw meat dumpling get out of here I want I got no I have no beef with you none you
[418:09.15]to cross a bridge I can't get attacked especially have to jump I have to jump now I'm really glad that I wasn't paying attention because if I was paying attention I would have gotten grabbed and fallen down the hole that's what exactly what would have just happened
[419:02.02]Do not I okay actually have to be very careful now.
[419:19.16]I have nothing that's not true I do have something
[419:41.43]You need to spend mana to... That was my plan all along.
[419:55.36]These things cost mana.
[420:01.82]I gotta be ready.
[420:20.83]I don't know.
[420:29.33]Oh, hold on.
[420:33.15]Hold on a second.
[420:36.11]Hold on a second.
[421:00.27]What is that?
[421:01.69]Is that something important?
[421:02.81]I don't know.
[421:05.96]Got maggots all over it.
[421:31.14]Oh, it's the giant jar.
[421:39.65]Look at that.
[421:43.93]Damn it.
[421:44.77]I missed that one.
[421:47.89]Well, at least this brings me all the way back up here.
[421:49.32]Oh, no.
[421:51.34]Oh.
[421:59.52]I think they're susceptible to... Don't jive off the edge like an idiot.
[422:09.63]I almost just walked off the edge.
[422:18.39]Well, this is what I wanted.
[422:22.23]Greatjar helmet.
[422:27.34]Hold on.
[422:27.70]I think there's somebody.
[422:29.20]Yep.
[422:31.16]That would have been bad.
[422:31.94]They have the drop downs right here.
[422:43.96]Uh, I can't.
[422:47.90]No, don't kill him.
[422:48.68]Just go.
[422:50.70]Is there anything else here?
[422:53.04]But about the secrets.
[422:53.84]This is probably secrets or something.
[422:55.04]Hold on.
[422:56.52]He cannot hurt me from up here.
[422:58.86]I don't think he can.
[423:00.14]This stuff over there.
[423:00.94]Watch this.
[423:01.30]I'm going to bait.
[423:04.74]Go.
[423:14.08]Not quite.
[423:20.30]I think I fucked him up.
[423:27.27]I could compile.
[423:51.32]Every stupid thing that all the sounds that come out.
[423:55.98]Oh, this is a long way away.
[423:59.21]All the sounds that have come out of my mouth.
[424:02.87]I could probably compile it, bottle it, sell it.
[424:07.77]There's probably 2,000 cartoon sound effects.
[424:11.66]You know, but you buy this library and it's royalty free.
[424:15.46]Yeah, it comes with a, you know, Creative Commons Zero.
[424:18.38]Whatever you want to call it.
[424:20.98]And it's just like 2,000 of my sound effects.
[424:23.68]And it would work anywhere.
[424:26.12]You have a funny dog that is getting chased down a hallway in a cartoon.
[424:31.87]And you can play with it.
[424:33.93]You can mix it however you want.
[424:35.39]What do you think?
[424:37.41]Alright, I gotta remember how to get back there.
[424:49.50]This is OK this way.
[424:51.64]Here.
[424:51.98]I gotta get to the jar.
[424:54.41]Room.
[424:59.33]Oh, I fucked up so bad.
[425:00.91]This is so far.
[425:05.57]Don't put me in the jar.
[425:06.71]I don't want to go in the jar.
[425:07.89]Yep, that's what that guy says.
[425:09.47]He doesn't want to be turned into a all this.
[425:15.86]It's also over here.
[425:20.44]Did I go in here?
[425:21.48]I did.
[425:23.54]Yep, that was the scary part.
[425:24.84]It's always funny when they try it too.
[425:37.73]Somebody did.
[425:40.93]Oh, I was laughing about this the other day.
[425:42.40]I saved it for now because we're in Elden Ring.
[425:45.82]This is a great time to say it.
[425:48.31]It's so funny when you kill somebody in one of these FromSoftware games and they give you like 20 runes or 20 souls and then you go kill a dog or a weird mutant rat and it has 200 souls and it's just like, holy shit, dude.
[426:08.28]That guy was a fucking loser.
[426:11.90]Like... Come on, man.
[426:15.34]Really?
[426:15.54]Really?
[426:19.83]You only got 20 runes?
[426:22.31]That's it?
[426:23.01]A fucking mutant rat down the hallway has 500.
[426:28.59]No, I'm talking about like a little rat.
[426:37.34]Forgot that's what happened.
[426:38.36]Okay, we're good.
[426:43.87]This is death for sure.
[426:45.07]There's no way I'm going to get through this.
[426:50.56]Oh, look, that's where I was.
[426:53.69]You wouldn't drop 10.
[426:54.65]But then it gets me thinking, right?
[426:57.47]How many souls would you drop?
[426:59.89]How many souls do you think you would drop?
[427:05.14]Would you have like a... Extra cartoon sound effects.
[427:16.05]Volume 5.
[427:28.64]I don't think I would drop.
[427:30.86]I wouldn't be a remembrance.
[427:32.80]You know what I mean?
[427:39.38]Nah.
[427:39.71]I think I would have 5,000 souls.
[427:45.31]No, I wouldn't be a remembrance.
[427:46.69]Guys, to me, a remembrance is... Think of some of the most important people that have ever, ever lived.
[427:53.42]That's to me that you... Oh, whoa, you got a remembrance.
[428:00.01]I hope this moves.
[428:02.43]It doesn't move.
[428:07.84]Where's the one that does move?
[428:15.38]Here we go.
[428:20.49]OK, I feel like George Washington would have a remembrance.
[428:26.17]Not some Twitch streamer.
[428:29.27]I missed.
[428:29.99]I didn't.
[428:34.88]And then you gotta think about, like, what would, okay, what would, like, George Washington's remembrance items be?
[428:41.40]One would be wooden teeth.
[428:44.20]Be like Talisman, right?
[428:45.36]Like, George Washington's wooden fucking teeth.
[428:49.30]20% more criticals.
[428:54.17]What would, what would your, what would my remembrance items be?
[429:01.11]I don't know.
[429:01.53]A rat?
[429:10.57]Well, that's not an item.
[429:16.45]A remembrance is not a fursona.
[429:21.69]Which one gets up?
[429:22.41]Where is he?
[429:23.86]I'm ready for you this time.
[429:36.55]I guess it would suck wicked bad, right?
[429:38.67]Let's say I died and everyone's at my funeral.
[429:41.35]It's like, oh, and now we get to see how many runes Jeremy had.
[429:47.19]And we could all say a quick prayer while we take a look and see.
[429:51.18]40.
[429:52.54]Kind of bullshit, don't you think?
[430:08.77]and then the priest like picks it up and he just goes and he goes and he starts going hey look at me I have the power and then he turns on a stream and just does what I did
[430:29.11]And then somebody, like, backstabs that.
[430:34.53]And then somebody else gets my remembrance.
[430:36.61]How does that work?
[430:39.19]Okay, if somebody killed me in this game, would they get all the things I've ever learned?
[430:45.03]Would they get, like, if you killed this character, like, in the game's lore, would you get all this shit?
[430:52.70]Would you?
[430:53.36]Holy fucking moly, man.
[430:54.90]This guy did a lot, and he knew a lot.
[431:00.22]Or would you just get like a hundred million souls?
[431:11.21]Your remembrances would be a yellow M&M and the other one would be your stream key.
[431:24.08]I hope... I... I didn't get... I didn't get my fucking runes.
[431:37.75]How many were there?
[431:42.46]I did?
[431:43.54]Oh, I didn't remember.
[431:44.20]Hey, how's that for a, you know, remembrance?
[431:50.98]Ha.
[431:51.52]Ha ha ha.
[431:52.54]Ha ha ha.
[432:07.35]Fall in the hole.
[432:19.63]Retire again.
[432:20.61]Don't you understand?
[432:26.30]I'm retired.
[432:28.64]So I can just... It doesn't matter.
[432:30.42]I can say anything I want.
[432:31.14]I can just sit here and talk about fucking cheese.
[432:33.02]Four hours.
[432:54.67]I think there was another way to a different elevator.
[432:57.49]This place is actually very, very, very cool.
[433:10.73]Oh no, I didn't get the shortcut, which does the shortcut even exist here?
[433:19.56]Or did I just miss it?
[433:20.96]Well, got to kill it first try.
[433:22.34]Whatever it is, this needs to die first try.
[433:32.11]I'm ready.
[433:36.90]Demi-human- Settle down.
[433:55.95]Oh, bro, give me that weapon.
[433:57.45]That's definitely what he drops.
[433:59.88]Holy fucking shit.
[434:01.38]This guy is crazy.
[434:03.58]This is like Yoda from the Clone Wars.
[434:08.46]Oh, it's America's steak.
[434:13.58]Okay.
[434:20.93]Oh, thank goodness.
[434:23.29]Alright, well.
[434:24.99]Strategy time.
[434:25.77]Uh, just...
[434:29.49]Just beat him.
[434:30.81]How's that for a strategy?
[434:31.61]Okay, so there's a little delay on that.
[434:42.98]He's parrying.
[435:02.66]oh damn okay who is this jedi master swords master owns onesie you didn't get your ruins oh
[435:18.92]I hope it's that sword because if you get that sword oh you better believe I'm bringing that right to the blacksmith and that thing is getting upgraded okay when he goes in the air it's one then dodge don't it's not immediate
[435:54.02]Better.
[436:22.50]Let's go.
[436:47.61]Whoa.
[436:53.02]Whoa.
[437:02.41]Oh.
[437:14.81]He got me.
[437:16.22]He got me!
[437:17.74]He got me good.
[437:26.83]Sorry, I just went underwater.
[437:48.87]Weird rock in the way!
[438:27.61]I got so... Oh.
[438:30.47]I... Okay.
[438:33.60]This fight is really cool.
[438:35.16]But I just... I... I locked up.
[438:40.75]You know when you're on so much, and it's like, you're like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[438:45.55]Things are going so well.
[438:47.49]And then for some reason, you just turn into jelly.
[438:51.29]For no reason.
[438:52.65]For no reason.
[438:53.50]You just turn into jello.
[438:54.72]You're just like, okay, boom.
[438:55.86]Here it is.
[438:56.32]Oh, nice.
[438:57.58]Where?
[438:58.06]Where could... I... Ow.
[439:02.64]Shit.
[439:04.90]I love this little guy.
[439:08.79]I'll get him.
[439:11.23]I was hoping he was gonna jump.
[439:34.17]I don't even know why I do that fucking thing I just did.
[439:38.38]I'm on that ride at the county fair.
[439:41.49]The big thing that spins around and you go against the seat.
[439:48.36]It happens to me every time I fight a boss.
[440:14.94]Jedi versus Sith fight.
[440:17.94]I had it that second time.
[440:20.80]My hands just couldn't press the buttons.
[440:25.19]I am using a plus 9 weapon, by the way, which bringing this into the DLC is like, dude, what crack are you smoking right now?
[440:34.97]But I actually like the moveset with this better.
[440:42.51]so so
[441:16.34]Stupid idiot!
[441:32.35]Come get me.
[441:48.20]There it is.
[441:48.56]It's all about the bully.
[441:55.73]Bully!
[442:09.01]I gotta go dodge forward.
[442:36.18]The fuck just happened?
[442:44.50]Oh, that's not good.
[442:49.46]I don't know what that was.
[442:50.26]I'm sorry.
[442:53.52]Forward, not backwards.
[442:54.44]Forward.
[443:03.79]Dude, Bro just goes fucking crazy at the end.
[443:10.32]Just that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... I'm telling you.
[443:22.11]If I had 20 to 30 damage more swing, he's dead.
[443:35.30]Why do I feel like I want to use this this time?
[443:41.25]Let's bash his fucking brains in.
[443:43.30]Oops.
[444:08.70]Holy shit.
[444:14.12]I got sloppy there.
[444:14.98]Is there an ancient dragon Smithing Stone?
[444:20.18]I have one.
[444:20.90]I'm just afraid to use it.
[444:22.72]I'm sure there's one or two more in the DLC, but I'm just afraid to use it.
[444:28.30]Because I know that when I kill this guy, that hopefully that weapon drops because that thing looks so cool and I can't wait to use it and I want to get it.
[445:13.05]It's slow, but I think it's going to work out, especially if I get a stagger.
[445:16.09]I got the stagger on him, but he just moves around so quickly.
[445:23.32]Looks like it's Moonlight Sword.
[445:28.42]I don't think so.
[445:28.98]It's just, unfortunately, the Moonlight Sword.
[445:33.66]Yeah, the Moon Veil.
[445:35.40]That's the only kind of faster weapon I have at plus 10.
[445:38.78]It's good, but I want to use something else.
[445:42.66]I'll get the Stagger here.
[445:48.60]Yeah, you just got to bully him.
[445:49.76]That's really what it comes down to.
[445:50.78]The more you let him attack, the worse it gets.
[445:53.34]And I'm probably in trouble right now.
[445:55.18]Which I am, for sure.
[445:56.60]Yeah, I can't move.
[445:58.43]OK.
[446:01.13]It's better with the little wing.
[446:11.01]Can also try to parry him too.
[446:12.79]That's not a bad idea.
[446:15.29]I feel like that I'll take 30 minutes straight trying to parry him though.
[446:26.56]This is like a leather shield.
[446:29.26]Do I even have like a good parry shield?
[446:39.32]I guess it's this.
[446:44.57]I'll try it.
[446:46.63]I'm going to keep this on because if I'm going to try to parry then.
[446:48.75]Let's see what happens.
[447:06.48]What was wrong with that?
[447:14.15]Jeez, that has more swings?
[447:23.43]That's not just a two swing animation.
[447:25.19]That's like five.
[447:26.07]Damn, this guy's rough.
[447:32.06]I feel like I got that though.
[447:33.22]That felt pretty good.
[447:36.36]I'm gonna parry this fucker.
[447:46.33]Got it.
[447:47.77]Don't do it twice.
[448:04.76]Yo!
[448:36.39]Oh, that's not parryable!
[448:39.62]Oh my god!
[448:42.37]He, okay.
[448:44.03]I wish I could just see him do that move.
[448:46.57]Is that at the halfway mark?
[448:47.71]Is that phase two?
[448:48.45]Because he goes like one, two, three, four.
[448:53.38]And then I think after the big jumping one, I think there's another one after that.
[448:59.80]That was the one too.
[449:03.51]That was the one.
[449:28.35]Two, three, four, five!
[449:35.66]I have to heal, buddy!
[449:38.91]No!
[449:39.92]Goodness, please.
[449:52.27]That looked pretty good.
[450:03.22]Dude.
[450:17.73]You wouldn't drop any souls.
[450:19.11]Yeah, because I had died too many times.
[450:22.86]Here we are at the funeral for Jerma985.
[450:25.93]Unfortunately, he has no souls.
[450:29.85]He died 250,000 times over the course of his life and didn't pick anything back up.
[450:35.47]So, thanks for coming, everybody.
[450:38.21]Please make sure to take some sandwiches from the sandwich bar and, yeah, have a good rest of your day.
[451:03.26]That looked good too.
[451:03.98]I don't even know what that does, but it's terrifying.
[451:30.00]Okay, it's not that bad.
[452:04.75]Ah!
[452:58.03]Fucking hit him!
[453:03.21]I got him.
[453:13.44]You get him.
[453:16.40]I'm gonna put him to plus 10 immediately.
[453:18.34]I'm putting that guy to plus 10 immediately.
[453:20.42]He's getting plus 10 immediately.
[453:22.65]I don't care how much it costs.
[453:28.65]He was so good at everything.
[453:34.14]We're not replacing Mambo.
[453:35.78]We're adding to Mambo's party.
[453:38.04]That's how you can see it.
[453:39.78]Woof!
[453:41.58]That end there, I was just like, I don't, I am so afraid to go near him because I just need to touch him once.
[453:49.27]But I was so scared I was going to hit by the blue flame stuff, whatever, blue fire.
[453:59.13]You just bought a homeless guy for 20 minutes?
[454:02.83]That was a, that guy had, he had a fucking green magical blade.
[454:14.87]OK, cool.
[454:16.05]Oh.
[454:18.33]And even these dungeon bosses, the little kind of catacombs dungeons.
[454:23.85]They are no joke.
[454:29.07]They definitely heard people being like, oh hey, time to go to a dungeon.
[454:32.88]Are you ready to fight another pumpkin head that's going to die in four swings?
[454:37.64]Holy shit.
[454:43.71]That was not a pumpkin head.
[454:47.81]Cool.
[454:50.09]Alright.
[455:05.28]Yeah, that was just one of these.
[455:07.64]That was just a dungeon.
[455:14.35]I hope you can get that sword.
[455:15.55]It would look so cool.
[455:16.71]It's like a little... You know the Holy Moonlight Blade?
[455:19.39]It was like that, but a little rapier.
[455:22.47]I want it.
[455:24.01]I hope it's in the game.
[455:24.59]Alright, what time is it?
[455:27.03]What do we got for time?
[455:28.35]I think that's probably a good place to call it.
[455:33.55]I think that's a good place to call it quits here.
[455:37.07]So... I...
[455:47.33]Let's go again tomorrow.
[455:54.28]Let's do it tomorrow.
[455:56.28]I'll be around tomorrow.
[455:58.72]Yeah, I know.
[456:01.28]Yeah, I'm going to do it.
[456:02.40]Let's do it.
[456:10.40]After tomorrow, we'll see.
[456:13.22]I'll kind of gauge how I feel tomorrow.
[456:16.42]I'm definitely happy with the... I guess the progress.
[456:20.12]This has been really fun.
[456:21.96]I think it's very good.
[456:23.28]I'm a big fan of the DLC.
[456:25.34]And I haven't even seen... Probably even a third of this.
[456:29.44]So... We'll see how it goes from here.
[456:34.21]Thanks for watching.
[456:34.89]I know it's pretty late.
