[ve:61.1.100]

[00:01.60]I'm pretty much ready.
[00:03.38]I just wanted to take a quick little stretch break.
[00:07.15]I know I haven't ran any ads.
[00:08.49]I'm probably not going to run them today.
[00:10.83]Just because I didn't want to interrupt the Q&A and I didn't want to go take a three or four minute break right now.
[00:18.76]So we're not going to run them today.
[00:19.84]So I apologize.
[00:26.99]You are going to get pre-rolls and I know that a lot of you don't like that.
[00:30.51]Apologize.
[00:32.95]We'll go back to our regularly scheduled ad programming next stream.
[00:53.86]Dreamcore.
[00:56.83]I started this game like a month ago and I wanted to finish it.
[01:01.15]And why is it so small?
[01:15.19]Hello.
[01:16.89]Okay.
[01:17.43]Can you hear it?
[01:18.96]You should be able to hear it loud and clear.
[01:20.82]Not only if it's too loud.
[01:22.48]If it is too loud, give me personally the ads and I'll watch them on everyone's behalf.
[01:33.61]Can't do that.
[01:38.62]Turn it up a little more.
[01:41.35]That's good.
[01:42.55]Alright, I started playing this, and I got to the houses, like, suburban level, whatever.
[01:54.52]I did want to just kind of chill and play it.
[01:57.29]What's your opinion on Kefir?
[02:03.29]Do you ask that question every day?
[02:05.62]I feel like I look over here and you say that every day.
[02:10.40]You right there in the chat.
[02:13.77]Somebody asks, I swear, somebody asks that like every day.
[02:18.15]That's the kafir guy.
[02:19.79]Not the first time.
[02:20.54]Not the first time.
[02:21.08]That's kafir guy.
[02:23.22]You read it though.
[02:24.06]I don't know.
[02:24.48]I must be conditioned to read the word kafir.
[02:30.59]You read it every day.
[02:32.47]Why does that keep happening to me?
[02:35.94]Okay, let's play.
[02:42.07]You just got kefeared.
[02:47.29]Oh, also, by the way, I gotta tell you what I... So, you know when somebody says something kind of fucked up on a sponsor stream?
[02:56.04]And somebody goes, Hey, sponsor!
[02:58.42]Hey, Jerma, can you be sponsor friendly?
[03:02.51]I love how during a sponsored part of the stream...
[03:06.85]The devs themselves are the ones that brought up a sex dungeon.
[03:11.76]I didn't do that.
[03:13.36]Imagine if I was like, hey, dude, hey, this is, hey, whoa, it's a sponsor stream.
[03:17.01]That's like what my immediate reaction was that was like, oh, but it's like, like, like it was stirring the call or something.
[03:25.75]That was so awesome.
[03:26.82]That was so funny.
[03:32.80]You can have your cake and eat it too.
[03:38.19]Oh, those guys are great, honestly.
[03:50.01]Wait, was something else up here?
[03:52.93]Why is Ster catching strays?
[03:55.96]I don't know, because it's Ster.
[03:57.52]Come on.
[04:00.49]You don't tell me that Ster wouldn't be the one to say, like, come on.
[04:08.01]6.43, that's not the time.
[04:17.59]My boyfriend is a classically trained singer and he says that Rainbow Connection is one of the best songs ever written.
[04:25.91]Your boyfriend probably has 150 IQ.
[04:40.48]It's funny, this kind of looks like one of the House Flipper Invitational maps.
[04:46.93]This looks like somebody built this in round one.
[05:00.52]This is just what a house looks like in a dream.
[05:03.27]I had a crazy dream the other day and I just don't remember what it was, but this is... Is it saying stools?
[05:09.10]Stools?
[05:14.23]Do I have to find a stool?
[05:25.28]You see that a new Katamari game got announced?
[05:30.21]Are you serious?
[05:39.92]Yes!
[05:42.44]What's it called?
[05:43.06]What's it called?
[05:43.52]What's it called?
[05:43.96]Wait, what is it called?
[05:53.36]A new Katamari game.
[05:54.36]Once Upon a Katamari announced for the Nintendo Switch.
[06:05.32]Oh man, we're playing this day one.
[06:07.53]Okay, there's a couple of day one release things that I'm playing this year.
[06:12.01]Wuthering Realms is one of them.
[06:14.52]And Katamari Once Upon a Time is the other one.
[06:25.13]I'm going to throw my entire life behind Wuthering Realms.
[06:30.34]This is going to be a Wuthering Realms channel for like a month.
[06:33.44]I don't care what happens to the channel.
[06:35.72]I don't.
[06:37.42]I don't care.
[06:50.38]Is there a flashlight?
[06:53.98]I don't think so.
[06:59.97]This one's cool.
[07:00.57]The one that I really wanted to play was the new one that was released.
[07:07.25]Oh wait, maybe I can go to the back door, right?
[07:10.78]Is there a back door?
[07:12.46]Oh, right here.
[07:18.53]When's the next Monster Rancher 2 tournament?
[07:23.11]I don't know, man.
[07:26.02]I don't know.
[07:28.64]Do it now.
[07:32.14]I don't think I can do it right now.
[07:35.19]Thanks for streaming lots lately.
[07:38.67]I'm just streaming.
[07:39.23]I'm just having fun.
[07:47.35]Have you done any of the enhanced bosses in Night Rain?
[07:49.99]Me?
[07:50.81]Yeah.
[07:52.67]Holly loves that game.
[07:57.95]Holly is the shot caller in that game.
[07:59.91]You know, you need somebody that's like, alright, we're going to jail.
[08:02.49]Alright, we're going to church.
[08:09.48]Did I turn on VSync?
[08:10.46]My game's like tearing.
[08:19.29]That's better.
[08:32.59]I'm going to go through maybe three or four more and then I want to see the new one.
[08:43.39]What's the hockey team that you've been playing for?
[08:45.35]What's your hockey team?
[08:48.23]I've asked for three years.
[08:51.92]My hockey like the hockey team that I play on.
[09:02.24]Or the one that I like?
[09:06.45]I mean, the easy answer to that is... Fuck.
[09:11.46]Okay.
[09:12.98]Oh, that'd be the Golden Knights, the Las Vegas Golden Knights, or the Boston Bruins.
[09:17.75]Hey, where have you liked to travel?
[09:19.05]What's your favorite places?
[09:20.41]Well, that would be the Boston Red Sox and the Vegas Raiders.
[09:25.48]How's the weather?
[09:26.46]What's your favorite climate?
[09:28.28]Well, that would be the Las Vegas weather and the Boston snow.
[09:33.93]Those are my two favorite teams.
[09:38.42]Do I know any other places in the United States?
[09:51.79]You waited three years for that.
[09:54.39]Okay, but you have to assume that somebody's favorite team is going to be the team of their town that they live in.
[10:01.61]That's how it works.
[10:05.42]Isn't that how it... If you grow up in Boston, your favorite baseball team is not going to be the Pittsburgh Pirates.
[10:16.29]And if it is, then the question I have to ask is why?
[10:25.86]If your family roots are in Boston, everybody, your mother, your father, your siblings, everybody grew up in Boston and the whole family was a Pittsburgh Pirates fans.
[10:37.77]I would just say that's interesting.
[10:39.51]Why?
[10:46.92]What if you have a found family situation?
[10:49.38]That's fine.
[10:50.88]That's fine.
[10:51.24]Like when you move.
[10:52.99]Okay.
[10:53.93]I'm talking about like in the entire family.
[10:58.04]Because they have cooler mascots.
[11:01.24]I'm not going to listen to this slander on Wally the Green Monster, okay?
[11:07.05]Wait, who's that crazy guy mascot that comes out and he, like, he... He fucks with everybody.
[11:12.54]He's blue.
[11:13.86]He's the blue mascot.
[11:23.41]No, not Grover.
[11:25.45]Alright, I want to do the other one.
[11:33.17]Have you been to a Raiders game?
[11:34.07]I've been to one Raiders game.
[11:40.82]I'm not a big football fan.
[11:43.83]I think it's cool, but I'm not a big enough fan to go get season tickets or something.
[11:51.52]Wowee, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[11:56.68]Yowch.
[12:03.11]Hey, would you ever make your own Kefir?
[12:06.05]Uh, that's Strike 2.
[12:08.59]That's Strike 2.
[12:09.58]Mods?
[12:13.40]That's a permanent ban.
[12:14.78]If that dude says anything about Kefir again.
[12:17.30]That's Strike 2.
[12:27.95]That's Strike 2.
[12:29.96]I'm sorry.
[12:32.12]If you got your moment there and then you just go like 10 minutes later, I want to do the same moment again.
[12:40.30]Bro.
[12:41.38]Come on, man.
[12:42.18]Come on, Gwen.
[12:43.33]What's going on here?
[12:47.32]Oh, this one's cool.
[13:08.20]It's kind of funny.
[13:08.72]This kind of feels like what it was like when mom was out of sight for 10 seconds when you were at Chuck E. Cheese.
[13:16.99]Like, wait a minute.
[13:18.31]Wait a minute.
[13:18.89]Wait, wait a minute.
[13:20.07]Where is this?
[13:21.25]Wait a minute.
[13:21.65]Wait a minute.
[13:22.11]Mom?
[13:26.96]What is this room?
[13:37.53]Ball pits?
[13:41.35]Oh, that just gave me an insane craving for Dippin' Dots ice cream right now.
[13:47.54]What's going on with Dippin' Dots, by the way?
[13:49.10]Can anybody please explain this to me?
[13:52.15]Dippin' Dots is like the greatest ice cream ever.
[13:55.17]And I think that they have like a fake scarcity with this because it's only available in vending machines at Walmart or at a carnival.
[14:06.28]Why can't I just have this?
[14:09.99]Why can't I do it?
[14:10.77]It's because it's like a frozen at a certain temperature.
[14:12.62]It requires liquid nitrogen.
[14:17.98]Right.
[14:18.24]But there's no way I can get that on demand somehow, but not have it be a piece of shit.
[14:26.38]It would melt on the way home.
[14:30.28]It's not artificial scarcity.
[14:31.36]They just suck.
[14:34.85]Dippin' Dots is so good.
[14:36.83]It is S tier.
[14:38.75]It's S tier.
[14:39.84]That's unbelievable.
[14:45.30]No?
[14:46.04]What?
[14:46.42]Okay.
[14:47.67]This chat is... What time is it right now?
[14:50.39]This is an early stream.
[14:51.77]This is the... I got... Do I got the... What crowd do I got here?
[14:54.88]This is what?
[14:55.18]The EU crowd?
[14:56.92]EU crowd doesn't like Dippin' Dots?
[14:59.42]I gotta remember that for next time I decide to stream at 11 o'clock in the morning.
[15:05.58]If you're 12, they're S tier.
[15:18.03]They're awesome.
[15:33.17]Don't you just want to just take a huge bite out of that wall right there?
[15:40.82]I just want to just... I feel like that would be ice cream.
[15:44.32]I feel like this whole entire thing is made of ice cream.
[15:54.49]Hey, what's that viral ice cream?
[15:56.79]What's it called?
[15:57.57]It's like the viral ice cream everybody was eating.
[16:00.45]It's like a little mango or something.
[16:07.88]this is cool looking it's the dubai char that you got that what is wrong with humans can we talk about this for a second what is wrong with human beings
[16:26.26]Why do we do every like six months?
[16:28.88]It's like there's a new thing that everybody's just like, that's the thing that we're all gonna do and we're all gonna say and we're all gonna eat and we're all gonna say it a thousand times in a row.
[16:39.09]What's going on with everybody?
[16:42.00]Why do we do this?
[16:43.10]I'm guilty of this sometimes too.
[16:54.13]It's the horde mentality.
[16:59.82]Okay, that was weird.
[17:00.68]That one got me.
[17:11.80]I want to go in there.
[17:19.23]I don't know, but I'm a mobile.
[17:20.32]How do you clean a grill?
[17:30.50]Double click what you just wrote.
[17:32.34]Control C. Go this way with your mouse.
[17:36.75]Open up Chrome, Firefox, whatever browser you use.
[17:41.43]Hit into tab, the search tab.
[17:43.70]Control V. Enter.
[17:46.98]And there'll be like a thousand things for you to tell you how to do that.
[17:53.09]He's on mobile.
[17:54.33]I...
[17:55.64]So hold your finger down and have it do the thing where, oh, did you want that?
[18:00.41]No.
[18:00.83]And then you have to take your finger and drag the top little thing to try to get the first letter and then drag the other one to get the last letter when you could have just already typed it into Google.
[18:15.86]Hashtag relatable to everybody.
[18:19.24]Oh, wrong way.
[18:29.80]It's bright.
[18:32.34]Oh, there's a key.
[18:35.09]Where's this key?
[18:42.97]Grab a key.
[18:43.81]Why did they tell me to grab a key?
[18:49.62]Is there a key on the ground?
[19:02.72]Hey, what does that do?
[19:09.41]Why do you describe everything so weirdly?
[19:13.33]You have to ask, for every reaction, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[19:20.30]When somebody asks me, hey, when was the last time you cleaned your, uh, La Boo Boo Dubai, chocolate, um, frozen Dippin' Dots toilet brush?
[19:29.84]There's an equal and opposite reaction to that.
[19:34.83]I'm going to be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[19:36.41]Let me explain why.
[19:37.16]Let's go over this.
[19:41.91]That's got to be 20% of every chat message.
[19:58.46]Who's the superhero that anytime somebody, you know, attacks him, there's a stronger attack?
[20:05.21]A Thorns.
[20:07.23]Thorns.
[20:08.26]I am a Thorns streamer.
[20:10.88]So if you come at me, it's just, boom, I'm coming right back at you with a flip-flopping centrist take to move on from the conversation.
[20:22.32]I'm a Thorns build.
[20:32.94]Did you like the Minecraft movie?
[20:36.10]If you liked the Minecraft movie, that's up to you to decide that, not for me to decide.
[20:39.45]I have not seen it yet, but I planned on it.
[20:48.97]Thorns.
[21:04.02]The game we're playing after this is a game called Urge.
[21:10.01]I want to check it out.
[21:13.49]Oh, hold on.
[21:14.61]Stop.
[21:17.40]It is the P game.
[21:18.50]Yeah, it is the P game.
[21:20.42]I don't know anything about it.
[21:21.46]It looks like a crafting build survival game.
[21:24.88]Whatever.
[21:25.34]Let's just play it.
[21:25.93]Who cares?
[21:26.39]Wait, why is it telling me to go this way now?
[21:38.24]These directions are inaccurate.
[21:40.41]Whoa, that was weird.
[21:54.50]I urge you to rate Kefir brands.
[21:56.66]Goodbye.
[21:58.39]Goodbye.
[22:00.37]It was nice knowing you.
[22:01.27]Goodbye.
[22:05.66]That's it.
[22:06.56]That's it.
[22:07.44]That's strike three.
[22:10.49]It's the end of the inning.
[22:11.93]That's it.
[22:19.00]I'm playing by the rules here.
[22:20.94]I just made the rules and you got up to the plate and you took a swing.
[22:31.80]Why are you so offended by fermented milk?
[22:40.46]Is that Lego?
[22:43.24]Hey, Bookworm Adventures guy.
[22:45.57]But... Kefir.
[22:50.71]I'll play that.
[23:06.47]I love Kefir.
[23:07.29]It's great.
[23:09.81]It's a delicious drink.
[23:11.09]It's got a lot of health benefits.
[23:13.89]It's got probiotics in it.
[23:15.07]It's like yogurt.
[23:16.84]It's good.
[23:17.78]It's a nice thing to drink.
[23:21.51]Okay.
[23:23.69]We don't need to speak anymore on the subject.
[23:32.48]What else do you want me to say about it?
[23:35.66]What else do you want me to say?
[23:37.58]What's my favorite flavor?
[23:39.41]They're all good.
[23:40.07]How about strawberry?
[23:42.71]I don't know.
[23:43.15]Would you ever butt chug it?
[23:46.78]Alright, that person actually needs to be timed out for real.
[23:49.70]That person's gotta go.
[23:52.19]The answer is no.
[23:56.26]He hates us.
[24:07.59]See, this is what I was talking about.
[24:08.59]That's what I was talking about.
[24:10.39]20% of these chat messages are like, oh, how do you feel about, like, uh, poo-poo donut, um, roller coasters?
[24:17.40]And it's like, dude, I don't know what the fuck you're even saying in here.
[24:22.07]People just type their, like, intrusive thoughts into this chat.
[24:25.57]And we have to decipher their hieroglyphics.
[24:34.89]Oh.
[24:38.89]How do I open this?
[24:39.59]I need to open the yellow door.
[24:46.78]I almost got scared by that.
[24:47.60]That was a person.
[24:54.33]We could all be bots though.
[24:58.95]That'd be so sad.
[25:02.78]If I looked over here one day, like let's say, and it was like, it had been confirmed that like all of you were bots and my entire life for the last 10 years has just been a fucking sham.
[25:16.22]Just not even real.
[25:18.66]It would be like, holy shit, my whole life is just going to turn upside down.
[25:22.22]That'd be fucking insane.
[25:23.60]Truman Show?
[25:29.09]No, that would be the, that would, no, if you were all fake.
[25:34.10]Think about how much stuff I've said, how long I've been doing this.
[25:38.61]And I think I'm just talking to a bunch of people.
[25:41.21]I really believe that there's a lot of people here in chat right now.
[25:44.36]If for 15 years that was just not the case at all and there was like four of you.
[25:51.38]That would be kind of fucked up.
[25:59.83]Alright, we should do a test.
[26:02.15]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright.
[26:03.67]What's something you guys could do that a bot wouldn't do?
[26:06.82]And how many people can we, like, capture doing it?
[26:10.94]What's, like, a phrase?
[26:11.68]Is there something that, like, a bot is not programmed to say it?
[26:23.43]I think there's plenty of bots that are programmed to say bot chug.
[26:25.60]I would imagine that would be one of the things.
[26:26.82]That's probably one of the first hundred sentences.
[26:41.27]LOL mods.
[26:45.77]We need to do a Turing test to see if people here are real.
[26:48.77]Let's do it.
[26:49.96]How many people are, what are there?
[26:51.00]There's 8,424 people.
[26:54.02]Alright, do a poll.
[26:55.80]And you have, please participate in this poll.
[26:58.02]This is incredibly important for my, for me not to take a total like mental damage here.
[27:06.89]Everybody vote on this.
[27:08.59]Are you here?
[27:09.49]Yes or no?
[27:12.22]Are you here?
[27:13.12]It's very simple.
[27:13.86]You might be in another tab.
[27:14.76]No, we don't answer it yet.
[27:17.16]We don't answer it right now.
[27:19.97]Please come over to this tab here.
[27:23.15]Everyone come over to this tab, please, right now.
[27:24.89]This is very important to me.

[28:57.34]Having people actually have to click, like, a website and say, like, hey, give a quiz of the last hour.
[29:05.58]But then, like, everybody would have to not share their answers.
[29:12.45]How many of you are actively here, right?
[29:17.07]Give a quiz to the VOD watchers.
[29:22.84]It's funny the amount of people, and I am in this category as well, I'm realizing, I, if that poll popped up and I was watching a streamer that I was watching and that I liked, my chin is at my chest in my bed, like kind of like, like this.
[29:40.05]And I see that the person's like, come on, please.
