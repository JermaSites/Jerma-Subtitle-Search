[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.96]Let's open it up.
[00:02.64]There it is.
[00:05.98]Let me just make this different.
[00:08.08]So I have a confession to make here, and I'm sorry to all the people that were expecting zero playing off stream.
[00:17.21]I played a little bit off stream.
[00:19.11]I did some side stuff because I just couldn't stream because of my internet, obviously.
[00:23.82]And I'm not sure how much longer we're going to get of being green.
[00:26.28]So, by the way, just want to make sure I say this.
[00:30.50]See you soon.
[00:31.42]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[00:32.34]It's been a pretty fun stream so far.
[00:34.89]But this might just go to zero because it just does that at like 7 o'clock.
[00:38.37]So, I did do some stuff off the camera here.
[00:44.97]Let's go ahead and get it on screen.
[00:45.99]There it is.
[00:48.41]And I can go like this.
[00:49.55]Alright.
[00:52.83]So where were we?
[00:55.95]I did one mission where I unlocked the fence.
[01:02.21]I'm an idiot.
[01:03.01]Let me just update this.
[01:04.88]RDRD2?
[01:06.66]RDR2.
[01:07.42]I can't.
[01:11.18]What do I think?
[01:11.56]Oh, title for this.
[01:15.92]It takes me, like, the amount of time to create a character in a game.
[01:20.13]To make a title in a game.
[01:22.79]Just do the boring stuff off stream.
[01:24.21]That was kind of the idea.
[01:26.11]Was to make a little bit of money, do some hunting, and trade some stuff, make some money, pay off my bounties, and now here we are, ready to play.
[01:36.62]Okay, how about RD, RD...
[01:40.51]How about just Red Dead Redemption gameplay?
[01:44.75]Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay only.
[01:48.39]480p.
[01:48.61]Am I trying to get people to not come here?
[01:51.49]I don't understand.
[01:59.02]Am I trying to just lose everybody?
[02:04.14]How about Red Dead... How about RDR2?
[02:09.02]No gameplay.
[02:11.08]Only commentary that's worse I'm just doing RDRD to continue Done Horse ball stream
[02:38.26]Oh, Red Dead Redemption.
[02:39.32]Okay, I got it.
[02:40.70]Boring title.
[02:41.50]Whatever.
[02:44.27]Don't you guys know?
[02:44.89]Don't ever judge a book by its cover.
[02:48.31]Open up the first chapter and read it.
[02:49.67]The Reddit Redemption.
[02:52.03]Alright, so here we go.
[02:54.79]Let's open her up.
[02:56.76]Wait, hold on a minute.
[02:58.14]My microphone is synced up.
[02:59.94]Okay.
[03:00.08]Okay.
[03:01.99]Just making sure I was synced.
[03:03.53]Make sure the audio here is telling me.
[03:04.94]Make sure we do this now.
[03:06.66]You should be hearing Lethal League ball hit every time I go... Okay.
[03:18.56]I'm ready.
[03:20.46]I did get another horse, too, by the way.
[03:22.00]Just go.
[03:23.30]Just go.
[03:23.48]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[03:28.60]Well, that's not true.
[03:29.46]I do know why.
[03:30.88]Those of you that were here for Lethal League and you don't want to be spoiled, you don't want to see anymore every streamer plays Red Dead Redemption 2, every single one, I understand.
[03:40.65]Thanks for coming.
[03:41.59]See you soon.
[03:46.66]Where's my horse?
[03:47.16]Over here.
[03:51.48]Toy Story Woody's Adventure.
[03:54.65]Oh, I can't.
[03:56.25]I can't take him to camp.
[03:57.09]That's right.
[03:58.07]Let me figure out what I want to do.
[04:00.15]Let's go... There's a Lone Shark mission over here.
[04:05.87]This looks like a... Let's go to Maryland.
[04:09.29]That sounds like a plan.
[04:10.17]Oh, no.
[04:10.45]Hmm.
[04:10.65]Hmm.
[04:10.75]Yeah, we've been on this one.
[04:16.99]Let's go to this one.
[04:25.03]Let's do it.
[04:30.64]That was a story mission like six hours ago.
[04:33.26]I think it's time to do it.
[04:41.21]This is a different horse, yes, it's because I stabled the other one, because I didn't want it to get too fatigued.
[04:46.71]Those of you that can see what happened when a gamer or a horse, doesn't matter if you're a human, everybody gets gamer fatigued, it happens.
[04:54.54]What's this horse's name?
[04:56.62]The horse's name is Thunder.
[04:57.62]I don't know, I was eating.
[05:00.38]I had fucking like a bowl of spaghetti in one hand, I just did the easiest thing I could think of.
[05:08.26]Whisper's still fine, yeah, Whisper's around still.
[05:11.76]Just stable.
[05:16.14]Oh, we got an event over here.
[05:25.73]Please, anyone.
[05:26.39]Okay, what's up?
[05:26.87]You alright?
[05:33.35]I got bit.
[05:37.15]Got bit.
[05:40.69]Medicine or a siphon.
[05:45.12]Suck out the venom.
[05:49.12]That's an option.
[05:49.76]You know what?
[05:50.32]This doesn't work.
[05:50.98]This doesn't work.
[06:00.96]Let's... No, it doesn't.
[06:02.22]I saw like a clickbait YouTube video that said it didn't work.
[06:05.70]You saved my life.
[06:07.34]I owe you.
[06:07.86]Not that, right?
[06:09.78]I do.
[06:11.56]You gonna give me money or something?
[06:14.03]No, I gotta get out of here.
[06:18.47]Alright, money.
[06:19.65]Treasure map.
[06:21.63]Family platinum jewel.
[06:23.91]Glad I could help.
[06:25.39]That's it?
[06:25.73]Keep your eyes on the ground, huh?
[06:29.28]You'll be alright.
[06:35.55]Let's go.
[06:38.87]That's it.
[06:39.77]Alright, fine.
[06:41.51]Fine.
[06:44.71]Yeah, I know I saved him, but doesn't he, like, give me something in return?
[06:49.87]You gotta have, like, something in your pocket, man.
[06:52.99]Alright, yeah, he'll show up later.
[06:56.23]We're good.
[07:04.48]Greedy streamer wants... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:06.68]We got a lone shark mission right here.
[07:10.16]I gotta collect the debt from somebody.
[07:14.74]First of all, put the bow away?
[07:16.84]Give me, like, the shotgun.
[07:22.05]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:23.13]Listen.
[07:24.43]Okay.
[07:25.99]Give me the double-barreled shotgun.
[07:28.83]Don't bark, don't bark, don't bark.
[07:30.93]These lone sharking missions, you have to go collect.
[07:35.33]What?
[07:35.57]Why would you put... What are you doing?
[07:38.55]What the hell was that?
[07:39.81]I didn't do that.
[07:41.35]Okay.
[07:44.57]Let's find him.
[07:45.51]Usually they run.
[07:46.23]I'm here to collect.
[07:49.17]I am, actually.
[07:52.19]Huh.
[08:05.22]okay the outside they're just playing poker where's the actual dude just explore the area eventually you'll find him oh there you are do you smoke sir
[08:24.65]This is not a long chart.
[08:25.83]Smoking and other hobbies.
[08:40.65]Okay, cigarette cards.
[08:42.17]Oh, you got me.
[08:43.83]Yeah.
[08:44.19]Oh, let me take a look.
[08:44.91]I actually have quite a few of these.
[08:46.01]Don't I?
[08:46.85]Yeah, I'll pay a good price.
[08:47.85]Okay.
[08:49.55]Here.
[08:50.35]Ah, not that I haven't got.
[08:52.35]The value isn't completing the debt.
[08:54.37]Sometimes I'll smoke up to 200 cigarettes in one day.
[08:57.11]Just want to keep opening the packs.
[08:58.53]I wish I could explain to you the pleasure and the pain I get out of collecting these babies.
[09:02.60]Sure.
[09:03.20]Well, it sounds... Thrilling?
[09:05.26]Yeah, it is.
[09:06.50]Not to mention the vast amounts of life-reaffirming cigarettes I get to smoke.
[09:11.75]Sucking poison doesn't work.
[09:12.83]You get it in your mouth and it goes in your bloodstream, see?
[09:15.43]Oh, sure, sure.
[09:17.03]A complete set of any series is worth a fortune.
[09:20.63]Yeah, look at this.
[09:22.20]Gunslingers.
[09:23.58]Over here.
[09:25.06]circus freaks yes yes yes meow meows of the desert so rare meow meows sure how much well it depends on the rarity sir oh of course yeah you know if you ever get a complete set I can uh take it off your hands and you'd pay me a fair price now you send them to me right here phineas d rams bottom at your service there's so much side content in this game it's insane I gotta run this is my train look me up okay think about this deal
[09:55.19]There's so much to do.
[09:56.83]All this stuff, you don't even have to do any of this.
[10:00.31]It's wild.
[10:06.56]Collect all the secret cards and mail the completed sets to Phineas.
[10:10.08]Okay.
[10:11.32]Well, so we're out this way.
[10:13.88]We're still, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:16.29]12 cards in that set.
[10:18.47]Still on the trek to go to see Micah.
[10:22.95]Good, good, good, good.
[10:28.99]Oh, run into the train.
[10:30.39]That would be bad.
[10:35.72]It's nothing impressive.
[10:39.16]It's still fun, though.
[10:45.84]You've been hunting in Red Dead Redemption 2 for the past week and hardly done any story stuff.
[10:51.52]Yeah, the Wild West is such a great setting.
[10:53.86]There's so much cool shit in this time period that, like, it's surprising that not more people try to do it.
[11:07.67]I definitely have to try to, like, road rage somewhere.
[11:11.39]Well, we actually have to go this way.
[11:16.49]We could use a bath, too.
[11:17.49]Horse is kind of dirty.
[11:31.94]Wild West VR game?
[11:34.18]That actually might get my attention.
[11:38.09]You would actually probably sit me down for 45 minutes straight, so... The fuck are you doing?
[11:44.25]Are these pigs?
[11:45.39]Are these dogs?
[11:46.29]Oh, boy!
[12:02.53]Oh, dogs everywhere.
[12:03.53]Is there another one?
[12:12.78]There's another one.
[12:23.43]Oh.
[12:25.21]What the fuck was that for?
[12:32.31]Okay One hit and I was dead there Damn leave him alone rip horse horses horse is fine Poor well, these are going to be worth nothing It's because I ran into a rock.
[12:56.76]Oh, I have the pelt on me.
[12:57.94]Come here
[13:02.40]dead.
[13:05.20]Stop running into shit and come over here.
[13:06.48]It's definitely not even worth taking these.
[13:13.25]I've shot so many holes in them.
[13:15.79]No.
[13:16.69]Forget it.
[13:17.05]I mean, maybe it's worth it for the meat.
[13:21.50]Yeah, I can cook the meat.
[13:22.40]I'll take it.
[13:31.74]Why did I kill the wild autos?
[13:35.16]Um, because the wild autos all ganged up on me.
[13:38.80]And tried to kill me at the same time.
[13:48.25]The game meat.
[13:49.71]I can sell that or use it.
[13:54.75]What's this guy's problem?
[13:58.25]Oh, is he mad about the wolves?
[14:05.95]Is this the same road, man?
[14:09.99]What, I'm not allowed to take the same highway as you?
[14:14.73]Good morning.
[14:16.91]Alright, let's go.
[14:34.63]What do you mean the first one to drop him gets the gold?
[14:38.41]What?
[14:40.23]Why is this happening?
[15:02.24]It's an ambush.
[15:03.75]Perfect.
[15:04.05]Okay, are these guys and the wolves working together?
[15:08.71]Seriously.
[15:10.59]Did they send their World of Warcraft fucking pets at me first?
[15:13.85]I don't understand.
[15:15.53]Alright, slow down, slow down.
[15:22.90]Everybody wants me dead.
[15:24.08]I paid off all my b bounties too.
[15:25.44]What's up with this?
[15:26.24]Alright, you're good.
[15:29.88]Let's get some free stuff.
[15:37.27]That guy had five dollars.
[15:40.31]Damn.
[15:40.81]Okay.
[15:46.42]This is a witness, right?
[15:48.80]He doesn't care.
[15:49.26]Good.
[15:53.04]Sometimes they stop.
[15:54.91]And they get very upset at you.
[15:55.99]These guys have a decent amount of money.
[15:58.23]Gold wedding ring.
[16:07.83]Where's this dead horse?
[16:13.01]These random dudes.
[16:14.09]Five bucks!
[16:16.69]Where's the... Where's their dead horse?
[16:21.93]The horse is back there.
[16:25.17]I'm too good at horses.
[16:26.21]Let me feed mine.
[16:37.34]Up on the hill here... I don't see it on the mini-map.
[16:42.86]Where are you, horse?
[16:53.39]Where the hell...?
[17:03.47]Feed your house?
[17:08.99]Well, oh well.
[17:13.13]It's back where you parked it.
[17:19.30]Did I go that far?
[17:22.54]Let's take a look back here.
[17:23.42]Because they were chasing me from over here.
[17:25.02]Okay, there they are.
[17:26.22]Are these the wolves?
[17:30.49]Are these the wolves?
[17:34.05]Are you a horse?
[17:35.31]No?
[17:35.39]No, you're a wolf.
[17:38.86]Well, well, let's go.
[17:40.94]I ain't gonna search around for it.
[17:47.62]It's up on the hill where the horse was standing.
[17:50.78]I wouldn't have to show up on the mini-map here, though.
[17:53.90]What?
[17:54.24]So many random things!
[17:57.96]So many random...
[18:09.52]Get... Come on, man.
[18:12.00]Okay.
[18:15.46]Hey.
[18:15.92]What's up?
[18:16.94]Boiled Satan?
[18:20.21]Yeah, I get that a lot.
[18:21.87]What?
[18:22.15]What do you mean?
[18:22.77]What's that you got there?
[18:24.89]You ain't interested in no scrap paper.
[18:27.43]It's nothing.
[18:28.53]Just something for wiping.
[18:30.29]He'll freak out.
[18:31.31]He doesn't know where I am.
[18:33.11]Well, I gots to go now.
[18:34.79]What?
[18:35.99]Hey, why the hurry, partner?
[18:51.88]Animal cruelty?
[18:58.47]This guy's an animal?
[19:02.29]What?
[19:03.79]Hold on.
[19:04.59]I got his map.
[19:06.21]Animal cruelty.
[19:07.88]You've acquired a map leading to a treasure that is rumored to be cursed.
[19:10.58]Many have died looking for it.
[19:16.66]Who's the witness to animal cruelty?
[19:30.02]A crime reported one.
[19:31.64]Oh, hold on a minute.
[19:33.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[19:35.58]They don't know the whole story there.
[19:37.11]That's absolute bullshit.
[19:40.25]I was wildly, rabidly attacked by animals and I had to save myself.
[19:45.71]I was getting, I was going to be killed.
[19:48.21]This is actually a pretty good horse.
[19:55.79]He's okay, right?
[20:08.67]Okay.
[20:12.92]New horse.
[20:13.36]I'm gonna get out of here now.
[20:18.00]How far away are they?
[20:18.70]They're not gonna find me.
[20:21.27]I'm 50 miles ahead of you.
[20:27.22]I shot a horse during a fight with bandits?
[20:29.96]Well, what am I supposed to do about that?
[20:31.52]I'm getting bombarded by all sides.
[20:39.51]Thunder's fine.
[20:40.09]Thunder's coming behind us.
[20:41.01]I need to claim this as my own, though.
[20:47.04]I'm gonna go to a stable.
[20:47.72]Is there a stable down here?
[20:54.17]Well, at least I got the map.
[20:57.32]I tried to be nice to him.
[20:59.22]He just didn't even want to have any of it.
[21:00.62]Sometimes it's not just changing the mask, gotta change clothes, too.
[21:13.61]That would make sense, no?
[21:15.29]Another random encounter.
[21:16.45]Please!
[21:16.77]Stop!
[21:17.17]Please stop!
[21:25.65]You need a ride to Strawberry.
[21:26.67]Okay.
[21:26.89]Lead the man to Strawberry.
[21:28.21]You need a horse?
[21:28.79]Alright.
[21:28.97]Wait, I have to lead him?
[21:53.72]So this guy's just a guy following me now.
[21:55.96]I have a horse he can get on.
[21:58.62]He can borrow it.
[22:07.81]Oh, yes.
[22:08.63]There was some talk at the country club about this burgeoning little resort town called Strawberry.
[22:13.17]So I thought it might be quite the trip to see what all the fuss was.
[22:15.41]Just an escort mission?
[22:16.21]Yeah.
[22:23.01]Not enjoying it, Dan?
[22:25.29]It's a town of splinters.
[22:27.38]If you could call it much of a town at all, I'd hardly stepped off the carriage and I'd taken in the whole place.
[22:32.44]I'm trying to get off the horse.
[22:34.93]I suppose some might call it charming.
[22:37.93]Let me tell you, charm is not worth much these days.
[22:41.13]You show me a timber frame, Jack, and I'll show you Broadway.
[22:46.56]He doesn't usually do that.
[22:47.26]This horse likes me.
[22:49.16]This horse bonded with me faster than anybody else.
[23:14.52]Please kill this guy.
[23:15.56]Why?
[23:15.86]I have no reason to kill this guy yet.
[23:18.14]For what reason?
[23:20.06]Look, I'm not just a maniac.
[23:21.94]I don't kill people for no reason.
[23:24.02]There has to be a reason behind it every time.
[23:26.64]A lot of people coming out of here.
[23:35.60]I have no reason to kill the map guy?
[23:37.00]Uh, the map.
[23:38.38]That he didn't give me when I asked it for.
[23:42.68]What do you mean there wasn't a reason?
[23:45.24]I want your map.
[23:46.09]Give it to me.
[23:48.51]I don't have anything that's good.
[23:49.33]This guy's not going to hold out on me.
[23:56.05]He has a nice hat.
[23:56.82]I don't like that hat.
[23:57.54]I don't think it would look good on me.
[24:03.26]I don't think that hat would look good.
[24:11.30]He's got nice shoes.
[24:12.10]Not nice enough.
[24:12.82]Why couldn't he just walk here by himself?
[24:14.88]I don't get it.
[24:16.02]He couldn't just walk half a mile?
[24:17.08]Talk to the mayor?
[24:17.88]Got some intel on the mayor.
[24:40.50]Maybe stay in town for now, huh?
[24:43.88]A rock and a hard place.
[24:45.96]Thanks anyway.
[24:47.02]This looks like a Skyrim town.
[24:48.28]This looks like the first Skyrim town.
[24:49.80]So are we done?
[24:56.93]I think that's it.
[25:00.87]Yeah, this is the very first Skyrim town.
[25:01.83]I never thought I'd be so happy to see this whole heap.
[25:11.30]I don't need to follow him, still, but I'm kind of... I want to hear... I just kind of want to hear his whole story.
[25:17.66]Hey, this is a whole town.
[25:18.28]There's probably a stable here.
[25:23.92]It actually is.
[25:26.46]Press O. No.
[25:28.42]Somebody already got me with that.
[25:30.72]I do have stuff to sell to the butcher.

[25:43.36]Alright, we got, we got, uh, not bad.
[25:48.64]The game meat, I'll sell it all.
[25:51.12]Maybe not all of it, because I can cook this, get rid of the shitty bird meat, shitty rabbit pelt.
[26:02.87]Turkey feather, I'll keep the turkey feather.
[26:04.43]I'll keep like five turkey feathers.
[26:11.52]Big game beat.
[26:12.74]I need a stable.
[26:17.74]Is there a stable in this town?
[26:21.72]There is no stable here.
[26:31.13]Well, that's just not good, is it?
[26:34.93]Damn it.
[26:36.49]No stable?
[26:37.05]Well, here's one.
[26:37.69]A little outside of town.
[26:41.73]I was looking in the town.
[26:42.69]Thanks for your assistance.

[28:53.29]You all thought I was gonna run right into him.
[28:57.17]You thought I was gonna ram right into that guy, didn't you?
[29:20.34]There's a time for living.
[29:22.44]And there's a time for dying.
[29:25.37]And your time has come.

[29:59.23]Horse care package.
[30:00.40]Let's rename the horse.
[30:04.84]What's the horse look like?
[30:05.70]We got like kind of navy blue.
[30:07.98]Could be Old Navy.
[30:13.51]Old Navy.
[30:18.75]What the fuck are these suggestions?
[30:24.40]Beanbag Sonic?
[30:25.28]It can't be Beanbag Sonic.
[30:26.73]It has to be like a horsebag Sonic.
[30:31.38]Why would it be Beanbag?
[30:54.91]There.
[30:58.51]Okay, upgrade.
[30:59.93]I got 320 bucks.
[31:00.52]Let's see what this big saddle's... What's on the back of Sonic the Hedgehog?

[31:38.63]It's worth it.
[31:56.45]I know.
[31:56.79]That's what I just said.
[31:58.57]Stirrups.
[32:02.07]Try to give him red shoes?
[32:05.07]I'll... I don't know if you can.
[32:08.49]Quarge rain rate.
[32:13.68]Bell stirrup.
[32:15.24]Any of these any better?
[32:15.92]I mean, we already have... The bell stirrup does a better job.
[32:19.10]Yeah, just put the bell one on.
[32:20.78]It's already equipped.
[32:21.52]Quarge rain rate.
[32:23.20]It's higher, but... That's fine.
[32:25.44]Horns.
[32:29.24]This is the joystick.
[32:35.14]Sock puppet?

[32:58.64]No, I don't even need any of these.
[33:01.66]Just the one that I already have.
[33:02.78]That's fine.
[33:04.54]Bedrolls.
[33:05.18]I don't think... Can you do shoes?

[33:13.63]Grooming.
[33:15.35]Main.
[33:15.87]We need long spikes.
[33:17.83]I mean, that's not even close.
[33:25.07]I get... That's as close as it's going to be, though.
[33:31.82]Yeah, it has to be the white ones.
[33:37.46]Good choice.
[33:43.30]What?
[33:43.50]You guys don't have mobile?
[33:45.86]Why are you saying that?
[33:47.84]Oh, you're the type who likes to stand out, huh?
[33:50.68]The song doesn't have a tail.
[33:53.81]No, he's just blue.
[33:55.11]That's fine.
[33:58.47]Okay, anything else that we can do No, I can't do anything with the shoes right grooming.

[34:29.05]A little bit slower than... No, at the moment it's a little faster than Thunder.
[34:36.79]I mean, Whisper's just too good, but that's kind of cheating.
[34:40.09]This is the You Spend $20 horse.
[34:42.15]No.
[34:47.07]Alright, let's go.
[34:54.52]That's not even a white main!
[34:56.50]Oh, it's the wrong lighting.
[34:57.78]Alright, let's see how fast you can go.
[34:59.04]Pretty fast, actually.
[35:06.65]Pretty fast!
[35:08.35]Back to- okay, we've- Micah.
[35:09.47]We were trying to get to Micah.
[35:18.58]Micah!
[35:20.96]Hold down P.
[35:24.77]What do you mean, pee?
[35:31.18]See?
[35:31.44]That was pretty cool.
[35:34.52]Alright, Micah.
[35:36.30]Time for a mission.
[35:37.42]Break Micah out of this prison, right?
[35:41.88]Alright, Micah.
[35:49.59]In here?
[35:54.76]Horse hybrid.
[35:57.60]Yep.
[35:58.40]Hello, sir.
[35:59.42]I've come from Blackwater.
[36:02.24]I'm on the trail of a dangerous gang.
[36:05.26]Como Driscoll.
[36:06.94]Heard you had some sort of incident.
[36:08.92]No deal with bounty hunters around here, son.
[36:11.55]I was just wondering if I could get a description.
[36:15.46]Well, they weren't friends.
[36:17.32]They got in a fight, two men got killed.
[36:19.20]Now, one of them's an idiot, the other's some kind of dumb mitt, so maybe them's your boys.
[36:24.34]Can I get my bounty back?
[36:26.00]I already paid for it.
[36:26.80]Thank you, Sheriff.
[36:34.03]I do need another outfit.
[36:36.35]I've been doing the same outfit that's been here for a while.
[36:38.25]Okay.
[36:40.77]Okay.
[36:44.16]Locate and speak to Micah.
[36:45.54]Do I have to sneak?
[36:50.78]Am I allowed back here?
[36:53.33]Oh, there you are.
[36:54.29]I'm antagonized.
[37:05.08]I ain't decided yet.
[37:06.46]Real funny.
[37:08.29]Oh, I ain't joking, cowpoke.
[37:10.73]I heard so much bluster out of your mouth these last six months.
[37:15.03]And now, I got an opportunity to watch you be silenced.
[37:19.63]But you gotta do something.
[37:21.83]Why?
[37:23.49]I always looked up to you, Arthur.
[37:25.26]You can pull this card.
[37:27.74]Listen, there's one little problem.
[37:29.98]There's only one of me and there's a whole town full of people.
[37:33.60]I do.
[37:33.88]So, wait a minute.
[37:35.72]Find a way to free Micah.
[37:36.92]Do I have to blow this building?
[37:43.66]Alright, hold on.
[37:46.05]Stand back.
[38:04.49]I did it.
[38:05.11]I did it.
[38:05.39]What the fuck is this guy?
[38:07.57]What?
[38:07.89]It worked.
[38:29.56]I could just stand right there.
[38:37.67]Take him out.
[38:38.21]I guess Headless is just driving around.
[38:44.17]What am I doing, man?
[38:46.25]I just used him.
[38:47.05]Right?
[38:57.91]There wasn't anybody even over there.
[38:59.03]What the fuck would I do that for?
[39:00.27]There wasn't anybody... I just lit another one.
[39:02.58]Throw it.
[39:02.88]Get it out of here, quick!
[39:03.90]Get it out of here!
[39:07.21]Why no wrong button?
[39:09.13]What the fuck?
[39:18.68]Okay, both of you need to know.
[39:21.12]If you press L2, it lights it.
[39:24.50]It lights it when you press L2.
[39:25.72]Oh, easy.
[39:26.42]I didn't know that when you press L2, it just lights it up.
[39:49.13]He's alive.
[39:49.63]Alright, we got some Deadeye here.
[39:53.91]Should I use it?
[39:54.39]Let's go.
[39:55.11]Was that just a random person?
[39:56.49]That might have been just a random person, but that was fine.
[40:07.06]I want to loot all these people so bad.
[40:14.08]Alright, back to the shotgun here.
[40:16.64]I got that?
[40:17.50]Wait, I got this guy?
[40:20.72]How did I get that guy?
[40:28.80]I bet he would have fell down.
[40:53.83]Get out of here.
[40:54.51]Call yourself a woman.

[44:00.85]Of course, stamina.
[44:04.41]Of course, health.
[44:06.27]I need some cores here.
[44:09.73]Here we go.

[44:23.20]There we go.
[44:23.70]Alright, we're good.
[44:24.72]We have some gifted subs here.
[44:26.26]From Kazzy.
[44:26.56]Thank you, Kazzy101.
[44:28.26]For your five gifted subs.
[44:29.56]Thanks a lot, man.
[44:43.44]Thanks for your generosity.
[44:44.35]Lightning.
[44:44.81]Ooh.
[44:44.97]I like the storm skyship.
[44:46.85]It's pretty cool.
[44:48.07]I kind of need to do this, right?
[44:49.49]With that stormy sky.
[44:50.27]It looks good.
[45:15.40]I think we finally lost them.
[45:17.86]I hope so.
[45:19.04]I'm giving you a holster.
[45:20.98]My way of saying thank you.
[45:22.90]And thank you.
[45:23.74]A holster?
[45:24.48]There I was, having a dull day only for you.
[45:28.66]To liven it up by letting me help you shoot up half a town.
[45:32.38]You're a funny fella, Arthur.
[45:33.83]Real funny.
[45:35.87]Why you act all sour all the time?
[45:37.71]Yeah, well, you ain't funny at all, so why you gotta act like the court jester?
[45:41.43]Alright, listen.
[45:42.59]I'm sorry, but we're family now.
[45:45.43]Arthur, you and me.
[45:47.67]I don't know about this guy.
[45:51.26]Makes us brothers.
[45:53.58]Sometimes, brothers make mistakes.
[45:57.61]I'm heading back to my little camp, round back a strawberry.
[46:01.09]Come see me.
[46:02.19]Can you get struck by lightning in Red Dead Redemption 2?
[46:04.61]You ain't heading back to Dutch?
[46:06.83]That would be hysterical.
[46:09.11]I ain't seeing Dutch till I can bring him a peace offering.
[46:13.67]No, you cannot.
[46:14.55]Are you kidding me?
[46:21.12]Are they trying to make this the best game ever?
[46:26.21]You can now own the offhand holster.
[46:28.23]This allows you to carry two sidearms at once.
[46:30.31]And dual wield them.
[46:34.36]Okay.
[46:34.60]How are we doing?
[46:38.26]Sawed off shotgun.
[46:39.44]So this is dual wield.
[46:41.70]Oh man, that's cool.
[46:45.53]What does aiming do then?
[46:46.35]Does it both of them at the same time?
[46:53.25]Committing serious crimes will cause towns to go into lockdowns.
[46:55.76]This is shown by a red area in the pause map.
[47:02.64]So, we killed everybody in this town, so we can no longer use this town.
[47:09.28]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[47:10.42]I have a bounty in here?
[47:14.72]$85.
[47:14.78]Well, that wasn't even my fault.
[47:17.12]That's bullshit.
[47:22.81]Let's go, you dual-wield.
[47:27.24]Oh, right.
[47:27.84]I forgot.
[47:28.42]I'm aiming the gun at people.
[47:44.24]That guy doesn't have a face anymore.
[47:49.73]You can't just do that.
[47:50.81]Well, I was just checking the dual wield.
[47:52.83]Uh-oh.
[47:53.89]Uh-oh.
[47:55.64]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[47:56.76]Stop.
[47:57.04]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[48:00.14]You didn't see shit.
[48:01.62]You know what?
[48:02.30]Just go.
[48:03.78]You got this all wrong, you goddamn...
[48:25.40]My aim is so bad.
[48:26.56]It kicked him off.
[48:31.66]OK.
[48:32.26]I got to get out of here.
[48:34.28]I have to leave right now.
[48:36.41]Horse revival.
[48:38.97]It's my horse now.
[48:41.39]There you go now.
[48:44.17]OK, you're fine.
[48:44.57]You're good.
[48:51.95]What kind of horse is it?
[48:56.85]Ooh, nice.
[49:00.97]Not bad.
[49:44.74]Everyone told me the horse sucked.
[49:45.95]I looked over.
[49:46.51]I revived it.
[49:47.05]It was like, horse sucks.
[49:48.05]Bad horse.
[49:48.69]Shitty speed.
[49:49.39]I just... I was trying to get off of him.
[50:00.65]Sort of dealt by decision making.
[50:05.84]I didn't... Hey, he ran.
[50:07.04]I didn't.
[50:08.26]I just got off of him.
[50:09.20]Alright?
[50:14.52]I just got off.
[50:20.56]That made me sad.
[50:22.06]I'm sorry.
[50:22.80]No, I'm not gonna jump off.
[50:28.59]I just... I got hit by the telephone pole.
[50:36.71]Can I get down there from here?
[50:38.03]No, I probably can't.
[50:38.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[50:41.13]Come on a second here.
[50:45.43]I think we may have found a little campsite.
[50:52.21]Let's hitch the horse.
[50:57.80]Get some backpacks and everything.
[50:59.08]There's probably something over here.
[51:02.10]This is why this game's so cool, because there's just random shit everywhere.
[51:08.00]It's got to be something, right?
[51:10.13]All this stuff over here, and there's not anything here for me to take.
[51:14.82]This is really cool.
[51:16.82]Nothing?
[51:17.14]Yeah, there's a box right here.
[51:20.71]I didn't show up when I walked into it before.
[51:30.49]Apparently, I can't do anything with this.
[51:37.91]No, I don't want to...
[51:44.98]I opened it up.
[51:45.58]Alright.
[51:46.84]So what's in it?
[51:57.89]Stand on the other side.
[51:58.93]What?
[51:59.23]That doesn't matter.
[52:01.17]There's nothing in here.
[52:05.97]There's clearly a fucking apple in here, though, guys.
[52:09.99]I mean, for real.
[52:22.85]No.
[52:24.85]Prouch.
[52:25.49]Uh... I'm doing it.
[52:27.43]I broke somebody's lunchbox.
[52:34.52]Well, you shouldn't have left it there if you cared about it.
[52:36.90]There's something over here.
[52:41.60]In the well.
[52:44.30]Let's go.
[52:48.51]Too blurry.
[52:49.17]Wait, I could actually go down this way, can't I?
[52:51.51]Yeah, I can.
[52:51.85]I can go down here.
[52:56.38]Why is this GPS telling me to go this way?
[53:00.62]I don't- I definitely cannot make it down here.
[53:10.23]Thanks a lot, fucking Google Maps.
[53:14.93]What about over here?
[53:16.47]I think I can get down here.
[53:22.53]We made it.
[53:22.89]We're good.
[53:24.51]It's alright.
[53:24.79]You're fine.
[53:25.13]You're fine.
[53:25.47]You're good.
[53:26.66]You're good.
[53:29.68]It's fine.
[53:30.90]Come on.
[53:32.22]How deep is this?
[53:33.64]I gotta test the depth.
[53:47.83]It's pretty deep.
[53:49.53]That's really deep.
[53:50.27]I don't know if he's gonna make it.
[53:58.38]See, look at how deep this is.
[54:00.50]You become wanted if you're seen in this area.
[54:13.63]I'm not going back there, am I?
[54:14.95]I mean, how... This whole area is on lockdown?
[54:22.10]I can't even go over here?
[54:28.51]Just be careful.
[54:29.13]I gotta, like, sneak around.
[54:31.20]The entire side of the map over here is on lockdown.
[54:33.56]Holy shit.
[54:36.86]Just don't be seen by anybody in the law.
[54:41.80]Deadeye Core is empty.
[54:45.33]Let's see.
[54:46.01]I can eat something, right?
[54:46.95]Let's drink some brandy.
[54:53.67]And let's also... Let's drink another one.

[55:25.02]Look, I'm here, guys.
[55:26.54]I made it.
[55:27.48]Keep your eyes open.
[55:28.36]Sorry it took me so long.
[55:29.18]I was a little busy.
[55:30.18]Where's that little Irish bastard?
[55:31.68]I'm not quite sure.
[55:33.50]I ghost-rid a horse off a cliff.
[55:35.20]I killed a whole town worth of people.
[55:36.44]Pictures of Dutch and Osea.
[55:37.50]And that's where it's going to remain for now.
[55:49.88]Why haven't they hanged Sean, I wonder?
[55:52.82]I think he's bait.
[55:54.26]Will they want to trial him publicly?
[55:56.45]Gentlemen, Sean is being moved up the upper Monaghan.
[56:00.21]You guys are good.
[56:00.71]You guys are here too.
[56:01.37]I started this mission as well.
[56:02.65]I was drinking in a bar and punching people.
[56:06.94]Sorry.
[56:08.34]We either rescue him now or we got him loose.
[56:12.47]I'm not cutting anyone loose.
[56:14.75]Of course not.
[56:15.71]Ike's skeletons, boys.
[56:17.57]I'm moving them to a camp nearby before handing them over to the government.
[56:21.97]One person thought that was funny.
[56:22.91]So, I guess... We need to stop them before they get to camp.
[56:29.86]Charles, why don't you head up on the north side?
[56:33.50]And we'll head up on the other side of the valley and meet you.
[56:35.76]That way we have them in either direction.
[56:38.38]Javier, Josiah, come on.
[56:40.52]Let's go see.
[56:45.79]I was gonna throw dynamite down there, but that's too easy.

[58:38.16]Have you ever heard a radio?
[58:40.79]No.
[58:41.01]I don't think so.

[60:14.26]Certainly kicking up enough of a fuss.
[60:16.87]So they're executing him out here?
[60:18.21]Yeah, that's definitely Sean.
[60:21.41]Oh, they're giving him a decent kicking.

[62:15.26]Calm down, mister.
[62:16.24]Slow up a little bit.

[62:54.29]I don't want that.
[62:59.39]I don't have a horse.
[63:04.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, where'd they go?
[63:07.54]Oh, wait, I'm in the water!
[63:12.17]I gotta go up this way.
[63:13.51]Hurry, hurry!
[63:14.09]I was too busy fucking looking at this loot.
[63:20.31]I need to clean this gun.
[63:33.59]Very nice.
[63:35.53]Who's the guy you got them from?
[63:36.84]Is he alive still?

[63:40.68]Go.
[63:42.56]Focus, okay?
[63:48.60]Take out the bounty hunters.
[63:51.30]Stealthy.
[63:52.80]No sound.
[63:54.83]Can't wait to get back home again.
[63:58.71]Me neither.
[64:00.65]The older I get, just travel.
[64:05.21]What?!
[64:05.49]They turned around at the perfect, descriptive time.
[64:39.92]I have a plan, Arthur.
[65:21.43]I already got him, man.
[65:22.19]He's dead.
[65:23.11]Oh, no, this guy.
[65:24.69]What?
[65:25.67]Did I hit him?
[65:26.95]Which one's Charles?
[65:27.77]I don't know which one's the bad guy.
[65:52.64]He's using the Lux.
[65:53.98]I just aimed at him and he died.
[66:00.57]Fuck guns, I have a bow.
[66:04.65]Follow him, boy.
[66:22.13]Oh, right in the throat.
[66:49.99]I only have one shot left.
[66:51.95]This is fun to use, though.
[67:02.10]What the hell is that?
[67:03.72]Oh, I'm gonna die!
[67:13.08]Alright, is that happening, or am I crazy?
[67:15.32]Like, during the middle of a fight does this happen automatically?
[67:17.60]You don't have to actually drink it?
[67:38.98]I got my arrow back.
[67:45.77]Rescue Sean.
[67:46.41]What do you got down here?
[67:47.75]Is this the button for healing items?
[67:53.47]I'm trying to... There's so much stuff.
[67:56.27]Oh, right.
[67:56.77]Okay.
[67:57.15]Shoot rope.
[68:04.25]No, I ain't doing that all over again.
[68:12.77]You know, you're a lot less ugly from that other angle, Arthur.
[68:15.91]Come on.
[68:19.76]Do I get a hug, Arthur?
[68:21.52]A warm embrace for a lost brother now found.
[68:24.84]New character.
[68:26.12]You know, nothing means more to me than this gang, the bond we share.
[68:29.88]It's the most real thing to me.
[68:31.82]I would kill for it, I would happily die for it.
[68:34.30]But in spite of all that, I would have easily left you here to rot if Charles hadn't stopped me.
[68:39.09]I don't believe a word of that, Arthur.
[68:40.45]Get him out of here.
[68:42.49]You're a great man, Arthur Morgan.
[68:44.20]The kind a young whippersnapper can really admire.
[68:46.92]Oh, shut up.
[68:48.46]Right, we should split up.
[68:50.06]Javier, will you escort Mr. McGuire back to camp?
[68:53.26]Charles best you ride separately.
[68:55.16]Be careful.
[68:56.20]There's patrols everywhere.
[68:58.94]What about you?
[69:00.00]I'm gonna see what's worth taking here.
[69:01.58]I'll meet you back there as soon as I can.
[69:03.76]Alright.
[69:05.30]Bronze.
[69:32.29]actually in human world hungry, not in video game world.
[69:41.93]Again, let me, I want to make sure I reiterate this again.
[69:45.52]Tonight, this is the suggestions, the green screen suggestion channel is going to be locked tonight.
[69:54.21]so if you have some something great that you'd like to me to see gotta get it there before uh like four hours from now hold on chest up here maybe what crime reported what did somebody call the police I don't understand where who reported the crime
[70:27.21]Nothing up here.
[70:30.87]Somebody's investigating.
[70:31.93]I gotta go now.
[70:33.71]Get up.
[70:41.18]I ain't going that way.
[70:44.16]Is there a date for the green screen?
[70:45.58]There is not a date yet.
[70:47.94]I think I just hit a bird in mid-air.
[70:50.82]That was weird.
[70:55.03]The date is probably going to be this coming next weekend.
[71:02.58]Alright.
[71:04.12]Let's see.
[71:05.14]What do I want to do now?
[71:09.72]What's this?
[71:11.98]Trapper.
[71:13.85]Okay.
[71:15.83]This whole side of the map is in lockdown.
[71:17.31]I have to go back over here.
[71:18.21]I don't really have anything I can do.
[71:21.21]I've got to go to bed.
[71:22.09]Let me go back to my town here.
[71:25.25]I'm gonna go to sleep.
[71:30.65]But yeah, I'm gonna hope for this coming weekend.
[71:35.39]That should be... It should give me enough time to buy all the props, have the props all get shipped to the necessary... I think I need to... Hold on.
[71:45.62]I think I have an achievement or something I can do to shoot rabbits on horseback.
[71:57.06]Kinda lost my opportunity there, didn't I?
[72:02.88]Maybe not.
[72:09.33]I'm very smelly.
[72:10.15]Yeah, I know.
[72:10.63]Okay, those are not... I don't think those are rabbits.
[72:23.28]What the hell were those?
[72:29.73]What is that?
[72:33.00]I'm dying.
[72:34.04]No.
[72:35.32]Yuck.
[72:55.80]He did the voice.
[72:58.96]I'm here.
[73:04.72]Wait, what?
[73:08.89]One of those is a raccoon?
[73:09.83]Oh wait, how is one of those a... Okay.
[73:21.95]I guess.
[73:25.78]I need more... I need rabbits.
[73:29.88]Oh, well.
[73:31.16]Let's take a look.
[73:31.72]What do I got?
[73:34.98]Challenges.
[73:35.98]Find a treasure.
[73:37.44]Win blackjack five times.
[73:40.78]Eat four different berries.
[73:42.44]Yeah.
[73:43.05]If I could just kill two more rabbits on horseback.
[73:48.97]Good luck finding a rabbit.
[73:54.92]Rabbits in this game are just everywhere, but never when you want them to be around.
[74:00.04]What is that lad down there?
[74:08.21]What is that?
[74:12.50]There's something up here.
[74:25.80]What is that?
[74:26.24]Oh, it's a skunk.
[74:39.77]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[74:40.71]Can you get sprayed by a skunk?
[74:46.33]This is a... It's poor.
[74:52.49]Alright, let's track the skunk.
[74:58.15]Can I get sprayed?
[74:58.87]I kind of want to just get sprayed.

[75:10.28]Spray me.
[75:13.88]Why are you so slow?
[75:17.20]Come here.
[75:26.47]No, I'm not going to kick a skunk.
[75:27.87]They're so cute.
[75:32.92]No, it's not going to spray me.
[75:34.50]It doesn't spray me.
[75:38.24]I can't do that to a skunk.
[75:41.46]Go live a very healthy life.
[75:45.39]For at least the next 11 months.
[75:47.19]Because that's how long you live.
[75:48.33]And that's just sad.

[77:10.38]Where is he?
[77:10.68]Is he hiding in the bush?
[77:13.66]Alright, so let's see if the turkey will spray me in the face.
[77:22.69]He just faceplanted.
[77:29.37]No, I don't want to hold it in that way.
[77:31.15]Let's go.
[77:32.61]Can you lasso a turkey?
[77:37.58]That's not gonna work, right?
[77:51.57]Where the hell did he go?
[77:55.51]He's just in circles!
[78:03.30]Where did he go?
[78:22.13]Uh, where the fuck is he?
[78:27.57]I don't see a turkey!
[78:33.80]Whatever.
[78:34.40]I'm gonna go.
[78:38.72]That was full on.
[78:39.98]Like, mouth into tree in slow motion.
[78:48.45]This guy got outsmarted by a turkey.
[78:52.31]Hold on.
[78:52.61]Wait, wait, wait.
[78:53.35]Speaking of animals.

[79:06.36]We'll just hay.
[79:06.90]Hay's fine.
[79:07.38]Okay.
[79:07.94]Pet the horse.
[79:15.41]Okay.
[79:17.67]Civilization.
[79:18.27]Okay.
[79:22.55]Oh wait, wait!
[79:23.93]He doesn't have any weapons!
[79:32.69]I'm just kidding, it was a joke.
[79:36.88]Here, take your horse back.
[79:51.31]Stop!
[79:51.57]Take the horse back!
[79:52.19]I was kidding!
[79:53.91]Hey!
[79:54.27]Come here!
[79:55.98]Come here!
[79:56.44]It was a- I was making a joke.
[80:01.92]Whoa!
[80:37.51]Where's his hat?
[80:41.07]No, no, no, no.
[80:41.89]Give me that back.
[80:56.34]Psycho laugh.
[81:06.72]Good joke.
[81:07.20]I wasn't really trying to make a joke.
[81:09.06]I just jumped to his horse.
[81:13.24]And then he got mad.
[81:14.84]Why wouldn't he?
[81:24.55]Hey, nice hat.

[81:57.51]Yeah, I'm coming.
[81:57.91]Let's go.
[81:58.15]Alright.
[81:59.37]Lead the way.
[82:00.15]Is it going to be a double cross?
[82:01.35]It better not be.
[82:02.39]So how'd you find him?
[82:03.94]He said he was going hunting.
[82:06.18]Never returned.
[82:09.48]I was able to track him pretty easily.
[82:12.80]Only a matter of time before they decide to pick up camp.
[82:16.47]That's really cool.
[82:17.71]The mission can come to you.
[82:18.89]That's very interesting.
[82:20.27]Fair point.
[82:24.54]Is this random?
[82:25.20]It might be.
[82:25.98]I thought he was just going to run to the tree.
[82:34.25]No idea.
[82:36.25]I need some cores here.
[82:37.53]Hold on.
[82:39.39]I need health and Deadeye.
[82:40.77]I don't really have anything that can do that at all.
[82:57.67]Hmm.
[83:06.83]That's okay.
[83:07.28]That's good enough.
[83:07.78]I really probably should just refill the Deadeye, but... Whatever.
[83:11.36]A rescue build.
[83:28.53]Any more arrows?
[83:30.47]Um, sawed-off shotgun... Double-barreled pump action... I think I'm gonna use the repeater here.
[83:39.81]How's this thing?
[83:42.45]How's this thing look?
[83:45.75]We could use a cleaning.
[83:46.59]Alright, we're good.
[83:54.98]It's in pretty decent condition.
[83:59.89]So we just take this out.
[84:00.95]So Bill is over here capturing.
[84:02.75]I don't know where he is.
[84:03.67]Actually, I might be able to get all but one Jedi here.
[84:07.58]Let's see.
[84:08.26]Hold on.
[84:46.38]I hope none of you guys are the guy I'm supposed to be protecting.
[84:50.94]Look at that horse!
[84:51.42]Look at that horse!
[84:51.84]Look at that horse!
[84:53.37]Look at that fucking horse!
[84:54.73]Come here, you!
[84:55.33]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[84:56.39]Come here!
[84:57.05]Look at you!
[84:57.81]You're huge!
[84:58.91]No, get out of the way!
[85:02.75]The horse!
[85:03.43]Hey!
[85:03.91]I need to... Who's horse?
[85:05.68]Oh, it's Bill's horse.
[85:16.03]I was gonna say, Dan, man, can I have that?
[85:24.56]Take Bill's shit.
[85:26.08]I owe you for this.
[85:27.84]Well, I'm gonna head back to camp, find a bottle, and nurse these bruises.
[85:36.79]I'm headed to camp as well.
[85:39.01]Thanks, Arthur.
[85:41.45]When they gonna learn?
[85:44.45]I can't make him have an accident?
[85:47.95]Alright, well, I should be getting on.
[85:50.67]Alright, Morgan.
[85:52.37]That horse is crazy.
[85:56.12]Well, whatever.
[85:56.56]That was cool.
[85:57.52]A little random encounter.
[85:58.52]I think I've looted everybody except for these guys over here.
[86:03.90]Um... Don't leave just yet.
[86:07.18]What about, like, crates and shit?
[86:08.98]Boxes?
[86:09.46]Anything up here?
[86:11.14]I don't think so.
[86:13.62]I don't see anything...
[86:25.30]I mean, there's a hat.
[86:26.84]Ah, ah, ah, there it is.
[86:28.40]Right here.
[86:30.32]Okay.
[86:33.44]What?
[86:41.29]There's a lot of stuff.
[86:42.23]No, I can't take any more brandy.
[86:44.45]Or biscuits.
[86:47.01]What am I... Get out of here.
[86:52.15]I'm finally locked in.
[87:02.15]Money?
[87:03.69]There is money in here.
[87:08.13]Dollar.
[87:14.29]One dollar in your chest of stuff.
[87:21.14]Might as well use it to cook.
[87:27.68]So, big game.
[87:29.06]Playing big game.
[87:31.47]That's really good.
[87:34.67]Cook one, eat it, and then store three of them.
[87:45.77]Alright, we're full on all the cores.
[87:47.17]Let's make another one.
[87:54.02]Cook the baked beans?
[87:55.92]Can you do that?
[88:03.48]I'm getting hungry.
[88:04.38]I'm getting really hungry.
[88:13.03]Something more important, though.
[88:18.25]The internet's been fine, right?
[88:24.76]This is pretty promising stuff.
[88:29.83]6,000 up the whole time.
[88:31.67]I have 23 dropped frames in... 4 hours and 30 minutes before that.
[88:37.07]How long was the first stream before I accidentally was an idiot?
[88:42.34]An hour and 10 minutes or something?
[88:49.40]When will I do 1080p streams?
[88:52.62]Now that is gonna take probably a little bit longer.
[88:57.42]Because I'm going to need a full streaming PC to do that.
[89:01.81]1080p 60fps is I guess obviously the grand of all potential streams.
[89:13.08]The only thing with that though is
[89:16.20]Did they ever fix the whole thing with... I remember hearing about how, oh yeah, if you have like an 8,000 up, 1080p stream, a shitload of people can't even watch it because it'll buffer out the whole time.
[89:29.29]Does that still happen?
[89:30.55]Is that a problem that's been fixed?
[89:34.97]That was a problem before.
[89:38.19]Even putting the stream on low, it brings it down to a point where you still can't even see it.
[89:52.37]1080p 30.
[89:52.57]Yeah, you can do that.
[89:53.55]I can do that too.
[89:55.97]I just don't... I'm not sure because I have... I'd have to do a little bit of research on 1080p.
[90:02.39]Mainly because it's a... This computer is... I got a 6-core processor.
[90:07.97]Oh, here we go.
[90:10.51]Let's go right here.
[90:13.69]I have a 6-core processor, so I could probably handle it, but I don't know if I could do it on every game.
[90:28.28]You care about this girl Stand up for yourself.
[90:36.32]She'll come around Yeah I've been waiting

[91:41.66]Oh, he's going to hunt those.
[91:45.15]He's still talking.
[91:46.01]He still has a blip on the radar.
[92:02.82]Maybe I'll just stay here forever.
[92:06.13]Waste away like some fallen leaf.
[92:08.93]Kind of want to listen to this guy's whole dialog sequence.
[92:10.83]Wouldn't that be nice?
[92:21.10]Come on.
[92:23.16]Can't move around here all day.
[92:32.36]Where does he go?
[92:32.86]Is that so odd?
[93:01.99]Oh, I was trying to talk to him.
[93:11.84]Just Superman punch him?
[93:15.20]I can't.
[93:16.96]Guys, we're evil.
[93:18.31]We're only evil when it's a random act of evil.
[93:22.03]You know, somebody stops in the road and they're like, who the fuck are you?
[93:24.35]And I'm like, who the fuck are you?
[93:25.25]I'm not just gonna murder this guy.
[93:33.31]Wait, I can't... I have to, like... There we go.
[93:38.65]I can't... I can't be in cinematic cam, dude.
[93:40.33]Like, say hello to the guy.
[93:54.62]Not much.
[93:55.84]Is he gonna... Am I gonna... This guy's not happy with me right now.
[94:00.48]I gotta stay back.
[94:09.66]I gotta keep a distance where I'm not following him Tay, it's right here This is the distance that I'm legally allowed to be behind him Before he gets upset about it
[94:36.13]restraining order no no I'm just saying like in the video game world rabbits rabbits who's just screaming did you hear that
[95:12.00]Is this guy going to walk all the way back to my camp?
[95:17.16]Just go?
[95:17.92]No, I need to know where this guy's going.
[95:22.11]Here are your choices.
[95:23.85]Okay.
[95:24.65]Follow this guy and see where he goes.
[95:26.71]Or shotgun to his head.
[95:28.85]That's like... Those are the two options.
[95:30.75]See?
[95:37.43]Follow.
[95:38.41]Follow.
[95:41.01]I don't have an off switch.
[95:42.77]I don't have an in-between.
[95:46.00]It's 1 or 100.
[95:55.61]What if he leads me to something?
[96:01.41]But not 0.
[96:02.05]No, never 0.
[96:02.43]Why would you ever give 0%?
[96:09.56]It's a good thing.
[96:10.78]Who is this?
[96:11.46]Horsebag Sonic.
[96:12.66]Oh, right.
[96:13.02]That's what your name is.
[96:13.80]I've been following him for so long.
[96:17.89]This is a nice walk, though.
[96:22.41]Nice and misty up here.
[96:42.59]Look at this.
[96:42.95]This is great.
[96:46.21]I mean, technically, I am going the right direction, so... It's getting kind of bad out right now.
[97:03.19]This is not getting good.
[97:04.33]This is... The weather's getting a little treacherous.
[97:22.62]walking home in the rain yep I feel like we're playing a an old recess game it's like red light green light this feels illegal yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry no okay hey this way what

[98:26.84]Ah, thank you.
[98:29.64]I got no money to give you, but I think I might got something even better.
[98:35.59]Well, I was stuck in line with this thief from up in the Grizzlies.
[98:39.27]He's still talking.
[98:40.25]Don't let him get away.
[98:47.45]Robbery tip.
[98:54.01]Horse!
[98:55.69]What is that?
[99:00.21]Is that the same guy?
[99:01.07]I don't know if that's even the same guy.
[99:03.23]I think this is a different person.
[99:16.73]I'm gonna run out of juice here.
[99:24.69]Where'd he go?
[99:25.03]Where, where, where, where, where?
[99:27.27]What is this?
[99:28.93]What happened?

[100:46.74]Congrats on a waste of time.
[100:48.24]I know honest to God Who are you?
[101:00.84]I won't buy it.
[101:01.88]Hey, Wallace, this here is the kind soul I was telling you about.
[101:05.40]The one that got the venom out of your leg?
[101:09.22]It's the venom guy.
[101:09.82]Listen, friend, I know I can never repay you, but how about you head over to the gunsmith and pick out your choice of item on my tab?
[101:22.76]Oh, well.
[101:24.08]You guys told me to shoot him in the head.
[101:25.98]Free item.
[101:26.56]Anything?
[101:27.61]I can take any gun for free.
[101:43.97]What?
[101:44.59]Any gun in the whole game?
[101:45.97]In the whole catalog?
[101:46.93]Hold on a second here.
[101:48.05]Rifles.
[102:12.37]72 bucks.
[102:12.61]145 bucks.
[102:13.15]180 bucks.
[102:13.37]120 bucks.
[102:13.63]These are locked though, unfortunately.
[102:14.93]85.
[102:14.95]95.
[102:15.73]148.
[102:17.49]One free... Oh, dude.
[102:17.93]I got a pistol cartridge.
[102:18.77]It was $1.50.
[102:41.62]Now it's zero.
[102:42.28]Alright, what... Just... I gotta calm down here.
[102:51.50]Just give me the most expensive gun in the whole catalog that I can buy.
[102:57.51]Do I get to save this or do I have to do it right now?
[103:07.13]This one's a hundred... This pump action is... I already own it.
[103:09.18]I already own this one.
[103:15.86]I can't even buy these because they're locked.
[103:18.58]Well, this Springfield Rifle is 120 bucks.
[103:21.32]I don't have this.
[103:26.62]Varmint Rifle, 72.
[103:27.70]I need one of these to get clean kills on some animals.
[103:35.86]Master Mauser Pistol, 250.
[103:37.90]210.
[103:37.92]150 bucks for the Volcanic Pistol.
[103:49.97]Schofield 84 Volcanic.
[103:51.41]Why is Volcanic so much more expensive?
[103:57.12]I think I'm going for Volcanic.
[103:58.56]Yeah.
[104:06.85]Most explosive pistol ever.
[104:10.11]Schofield?
[104:15.00]Volcanic shit.
[104:15.96]Springfield.
[104:16.56]Volcanic.
[104:17.00]Not volcanic.
[104:22.92]I mean, it's either... It's either Schofield or the Springfield rifle.
[104:31.67]120 versus 84.
[104:32.13]I'm probably gonna get... I need a good rifle.
[104:38.59]Is it single shot or what?
[104:47.61]Yeah, the rifle that I have is kind of junk.
[104:50.31]Yeah, I'm gonna get it.
[104:51.35]Single shot.
[104:51.93]Okay, that's fine.
[104:54.13]You can't aim.
[104:55.09]I'll learn.
[105:00.66]You get volcanic for free anyways.
[105:02.28]Well, this one's 120 bucks and the other one's 80.
[105:05.34]But more bang for buck.
[105:07.86]I'm getting it.
[105:08.78]And then we're gonna deck it out.
[105:14.67]Components.
[105:16.07]Hey, the thing was for free.
[105:17.06]Might as well deck it out.
[105:19.36]Uh, rifling.
[105:19.90]Customize groove to improve stability.
[105:23.06]More range on it.
[105:24.90]Yeah.
[105:28.67]Okay.
[105:31.47]Iron sights.
[105:32.83]Improve sights.
[105:34.83]This shit's five dollars.
[105:35.87]I got it for free.
[105:41.31]Can put a scope on it.
[105:42.29]Medium scope.
[105:43.81]Well, that kind of defeats the iron sights then, doesn't it?
[105:46.89]Let's put a fucking scope on it.
[105:50.90]Screw it, man.
[105:51.58]Let's do it.
[105:56.88]Straight grain.
[105:58.28]Wide grain.
[106:01.02]Basic grain.
[106:01.98]I like the straight grain.
[106:08.54]And let's get a wrap here.
[106:11.20]Did you not know that?
[106:12.90]It helps from wear and tear.
[106:14.12]I got a trophy.
[106:19.55]Okay.
[106:23.49]Alright, styles.
[106:25.47]Medals.
[106:27.97]This is the barrel.
[106:28.81]I mean... Gold?
[106:35.45]Blue?
[106:39.93]Hmm.
[106:43.77]Frame.
[106:44.91]To the whole thing.
[106:45.53]Oh, that looks nice.
[106:47.97]I kind of like the muted gold here.
[106:49.75]I don't... Yeah, we're going with brass.
[106:56.35]What about the hammer here?
[107:02.18]Brass.
[107:07.16]The sight can be... Mm-hmm.
[107:12.29]Brass.
[107:13.65]It's just a brass.
[107:15.81]Okay.
[107:16.41]At what point am I just making, like, a fucking tuba?
[107:19.63]You know what I'm saying?
[107:20.25]Like, I'm turning this into a French horn.
[107:24.32]If I blow in the end of this, it's gonna make fucking musical sounds.
[107:32.86]Alright, we're gonna go just straight up steel here.
[107:37.81]Ooh.
[107:37.89]Ooh.
[107:40.96]Baby.
[107:42.34]Full engraving.
[107:44.86]Can't really even see that.
[107:51.54]That's 28 bucks.
[107:54.68]Engrave the barrel?
[107:56.78]No.
[107:57.18]Engrave the frame, though.
[107:58.81]No.
[107:59.19]Trapdoor.
[108:00.73]You can't even see this shit.
[108:04.43]Carvings.
[108:05.11]Grip.
[108:07.29]Oh, man.
[108:08.35]This thing is gonna be nice.
[108:10.01]I like the eagle.
[108:13.37]Now the question is, which eagle?
[108:15.93]Are we talking just straight up like back of the coin eagle?
[108:19.53]Or are we talking mid-flight eagle?
[108:23.99]I think I like the commemorative gold coin eagle that's on the infomercial.
[108:36.16]Oh, it's ruined.
[108:38.26]It's being covered up by the thing to protect it.
[108:42.84]Leather.
[108:48.10]I like that.
[108:49.56]I like the chocolate.
[108:52.23]Chocolate looks pretty good.
[108:55.41]Olive, maybe?
[109:00.77]Tobacco.
[109:01.29]Let's get a good varnish on it.
[109:14.05]This is the piece that sells it, you know what I'm saying?
[109:20.19]That looks kind of good.
[109:21.95]Dark walnut.
[109:24.33]Where's my... There it is.
[109:27.62]That's the fucking desk I have right now.
[109:33.00]Dark walnut.
[109:35.20]Can I see a better image of this?
[109:41.88]Yeah, I have to do it.
[109:42.74]This is my desk.
[109:44.56]Did that just say desk?
[109:45.80]Oh, desk walnut.
[109:47.78]Desk dark walnut.
[109:53.76]Look at that.
[109:54.58]Look at that desk that shoots bullets.
[110:00.02]Ammunition.
[110:01.76]What kind of ammunition?
[110:03.00]Rifle express 30.
[110:05.28]Regular express or high velocity.
[110:09.86]This one's more damage.
[110:10.66]This one's more range.
[110:19.92]Hmm range or damage the never-ending conundrum It's already a lot of damage range I guess I can get them both, huh?
[110:37.63]Well, that was a lot of money three How much did I just how much money did I just spend
[110:47.69]What?
[110:48.17]What?
[110:48.47]What?
[110:48.73]I'm a moron?
[110:49.38]Why?
[110:50.32]I just bought a 100 velocity... That's $12.
[110:55.54]That's nothing.
[110:56.16]That's fine.
[110:59.00]So, I can switch between Ammos, right?
[111:01.14]I can just get them both.
[111:11.33]Okay, I'm going to use the shitty Ammo to learn.
[111:21.01]I have every fucking ammo now.
[111:27.82]Take off the scope.
[111:29.56]Why would I do that?
[111:31.36]Why would I get rid of my tuba horn gun desk?
[111:34.34]Are you serious?
[111:35.91]No.
[111:45.21]This thing's ready to go.
[111:48.75]Let's take a look.
[111:49.49]Let's check it out.
[111:54.67]Look at that.
[111:56.37]Oh, man, does that look good.
[112:02.42]So what is it?
[112:02.98]Let's go to the... I can't even open it.
[112:05.62]Nice free gun.
[112:07.02]Yeah, don't you understand?
[112:07.60]That's how they get you.
[112:09.54]The gun is free, and then you spend $400 on components.
[112:15.95]This gun is just a mobile game.
[112:19.73]How's it treating you?
[112:21.35]I need to get to a little range here to aim it.
[112:25.20]Go show the guy.
[112:26.08]That's not a bad idea.
[112:33.48]Where is he?
[112:34.61]Is he still here?
[112:35.35]There he is.
[112:35.69]Hey, man.
[112:36.15]What do you think?
[112:37.81]This is the best stranger in the game.
[112:40.47]Can I sit next to him?
[112:57.92]Yeah, you think you can fuck with the desk trombone?
[113:00.64]Thanks a lot, dude.
[113:10.22]I want to test it out, but I can't open- I can't take the gun out right now.
[113:13.38]I have to go somewhere safe.
[113:18.14]Snipe him from a distance.
[113:23.65]Alright, thanks for the new gun.
[113:26.75]Let me try it out.
[113:35.12]No.
[113:36.26]I can't.
[113:37.58]I can't.
[113:39.74]That's too awful.
[113:41.96]Where is it?
[113:42.42]Where's the gun store from here?
[113:43.75]I'm aiming.
[113:46.45]It's right.
[113:47.05]I gotta go around.
[113:50.39]Let me line them up.
[113:51.49]God damn it.
[113:58.15]He's right there.
[113:59.12]OK.
[113:59.82]Let me get this straight.
[114:03.56]I'm going to go up here.
[114:08.04]He's the best.
[114:08.90]I just want to see if I can do it.
[114:11.30]I just want to see how long the scope is.
[114:25.55]How do I change the bullet?
[114:27.94]Okay.
[114:28.90]High velocity.
[114:30.97]Okay, here we go.
[114:34.09]How do I go into scope mode?
[114:35.07]Here we go.
[114:45.17]That's not very far.
[114:53.42]I can't.
[114:54.90]I can't do it, guys.
[114:57.08]I can't do it.
[114:58.02]That's not nice.
[114:59.32]He gave me a free gun.
[115:00.42]What, you think I'm gonna shoot him?
[115:05.42]I can't do this.
[115:09.18]What if he gives me another free gun in like an hour?
[115:13.78]And there's no saving.
[115:14.68]I can't just save it.
[115:23.53]Look, this guy didn't give me a gun.
[115:24.97]We can test it on him.
[115:25.87]I missed him.
[115:56.70]Okay, the guy gave me the gun, right?
[115:59.60]I go out and I'm like, hey, what do you think?
[116:01.56]Oh, that's great.
[116:02.30]Yeah, put it on my tap.
[116:04.46]Like four minutes later, it's just quiet.
[116:06.79]All of a sudden, oh, a long scope shot dings off the back of somebody's carriage.
[116:11.45]You're standing right there.
[116:15.07]No crime committed.
[116:16.37]I'm fu- Oh, that's so fucking stupid.
[116:23.90]Nobody's looking for me?
[116:25.00]Oh, sorry, man.
[116:25.78]I shot- I shot a gun into a guy's fucking carriage.
[116:28.76]Come on, girl.
[116:35.74]You see me just like, oh shit, I gotta get out of here.
[116:38.99]Running off in the distance.
[116:41.51]Ugh.
[116:44.51]I fucking missed.
[116:45.78]Alright, let's go to church.
[116:55.30]This same guy, you turn around and he looks to his right and sees a guy going to church now.
[117:00.40]Oh, man.
[117:02.74]God.
[117:04.00]Somebody needs help.
[117:04.82]Hold on.
[117:05.15]Who?
[117:05.27]Who needs help?
[117:14.29]Apologies?
[117:15.65]I don't know.
[117:16.57]Who needs help?
[117:20.08]I don't see anybody.
[117:24.08]How are you?
[117:25.26]OK.
[117:30.84]I don't see anybody, so let's go to church.
[117:33.80]Excuse me.
[117:35.16]Whoa.
[117:36.09]Excuse me, but I need some money.
[117:38.07]OK.
[117:38.93]I fought in the war.
[117:41.21]I fought for you.
[117:46.70]Where is this guy?
[117:49.59]Someone gonna help a fella out?
[117:51.19]Oh, it's you.
[117:53.09]Okay.
[117:53.23]Somebody, please.
[117:54.13]Howdy, mister.
[117:56.43]Hey, buddy.
[117:59.83]I'm too old to get a job, mister.
[118:02.63]Way too old.
[118:05.03]Can't we be friends?
[118:08.61]Yeah, whatever.
[118:09.19]That's fine.
[118:12.33]Sure.
[118:14.07]I'm so happy.
[118:15.53]I ain't had a friend in a long time.
[118:19.41]Long, long time.
[118:22.45]My last friend died.
[118:25.07]Weren't my fault.
[118:26.69]They said it was, but they was wrong.
[118:31.38]It's fun being with you, mister.
[118:34.30]Can I hold you a second, mister?
[118:36.84]Can I?
[118:40.08]I'll go sing with you.
[118:43.92]I'm so dirty.
[118:44.32]We got more?
[118:45.12]On our money?
[118:45.58]You look like a ghoul.
[118:49.20]I'm sorry, dude.
[118:50.14]This guy's gonna come back at some point.
[119:18.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[119:19.51]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[119:20.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[119:27.51]Where's my gun?
[119:27.93]Where's my gun?
[119:29.93]Where's my gun?
[119:32.21]Where's my gun?
[119:37.39]Oh, shoot.
[119:38.71]Give me my gun back.
[119:39.98]I spent so much time getting it.
[119:41.96]Give me the gun.
[119:42.50]Give me my gun, please.
[119:45.84]I spent so much time getting that gun.
[119:49.79]Give me my gun back!
[119:52.19]Give me my gun!
[119:54.49]Where's my gun?
[119:59.69]Where's my gun?
[120:05.32]Wait what?
[120:06.94]What?
[120:07.96]What?
[120:09.06]What?
[120:09.82]What?
[120:11.64]What?
[120:13.46]No, what?
[120:14.30]It's almost- Oh!
[120:17.03]Oh boy!
[120:18.17]Oh!
[120:18.45]Oh boy!
[120:19.39]Get me out of here!
[120:26.11]Get me out of here!
[120:27.61]I thought he robbed me!
[120:29.03]I thought- Oh my god, my whole body is in pain!
[120:34.07]I thought- Everyone told me he robbed- I thought he robbed me!
[120:36.44]I didn't have the gun on me!
[120:37.66]I thought I had the gun on me!
[120:44.16]I thought I stole my rifle.
[120:45.88]I thought I stole it.
[120:49.10]Easy, girl.
[120:50.10]Easy.
[120:50.98]Okay, I got it.
[120:57.08]I got it.
[121:27.67]I gotta get out of here, dude.
[121:30.68]I have to leave now.
[121:33.94]I gotta get out of here.
[121:35.06]I'm gonna die.
[121:46.81]Get up.
[121:47.25]Get up.
[121:48.19]Get up.
[121:49.83]Get up.
[121:54.46]Ow.
[121:55.18]Ow.
[121:55.86]Oh my god.
[121:57.10]Oh, my stomach.
[121:59.95]No, get me out of here.
[122:03.05]Please, get me out of here.
[122:09.23]This game is fucking so fun.
[122:16.46]It's not hard at all.
[122:23.90]I can't look.
[122:24.88]I'll be so far behind.
[122:44.81]I was just like, come on, give me some slack here.
[122:47.69]Give me at least a little bit of slack.
[122:49.87]That was like a random, oh, hey, give me a hug!
[122:52.77]And then like, I'm missing my expensive rifle.
[122:56.53]I had to put two and two together.
[122:58.25]I didn't want to lose it.
[122:59.09]That was expensive.
[123:00.22]And then I looked over at chat and everyone's just like, dude, no, he took it.
[123:08.36]He fucking stole it, man.
[123:09.50]That NPC steals.
[123:10.50]And I'm just like, God!
[123:13.27]Oh, God!
[123:14.09]And I'm just, and I was like, God!
[123:15.36]And you guys were like, whoa!
[123:16.14]And I was like, God!
[123:18.02]Nice explanation.
[123:23.90]I punched him in the head with the gun and I shot him in the head.
[123:30.98]That was not supposed to happen.
[123:33.50]It wasn't supposed to be like that.
[123:36.90]The guy with the one arm.
[123:48.80]Alright, I don't wanna, like, overwork my horse here.
[123:53.51]Slow down, let's eat.
[123:56.85]Reload the s- I can't!
[123:58.53]I gotta sleep in this bed.
[124:01.61]I made the bed, I gotta sleep in it.
[124:04.83]You can't shoot a rifle.
[124:06.43]And, like, this thing's, like, dirty.
[124:07.53]I'm gonna be so compulsive with this.
[124:09.31]Is it clean?
[124:11.03]I gotta clean it.
[124:16.28]Why is it damaged?
[124:17.98]Okay.
[124:21.78]Reload it!
[124:25.93]How do you reload?
[124:26.63]It's circle is reload.
[124:27.93]Ha!
[124:28.23]Get me out of here!
[124:52.79]This town hates me.
[124:53.75]What?
[124:53.89]Did I just go back in the same town I just left?
[124:57.30]Get me out of this.
[124:59.36]It's a never-ending nightmare.
[125:05.88]Please, no.
[125:06.38]Who said that?
[125:08.58]They're probably talking about me.
[125:12.75]I haven't even had an opportunity to cool off from that.
[125:17.23]Okay, so...
[125:20.30]The rifle.
[125:21.76]It's circle to reload.
[125:23.94]Isn't it?
[125:24.66]While you're holding... Setting story load game.
[125:30.16]No, I can't.
[125:31.20]That's... No, I can't.
[125:32.77]I gotta sleep in this bed.
[125:37.19]There's no rewinds in Wild West, guys.
[125:49.22]This gun only holds one bullet?
[125:52.09]No, it doesn't.
[125:52.49]I have a hundred.
[125:59.37]I bet that snakebite guy is feeling very good about himself now that he gave that to you.
[126:12.17]I don't want to watch this streamer anymore.
[126:16.43]No.
[126:16.79]You sleep in bed.
[126:18.61]Okay?
[126:19.83]What's happening here?
[126:21.45]Is it the farmer?
[126:25.81]Where am I?
[126:26.27]Oh, it's the guy who owes money.
[126:29.71]Oh, no, no.
[126:29.93]I'm... I'm... I'm...
[126:42.64]We ain't a charity, Mr. Downs.
[126:48.39]Why is he standing still?
[126:50.67]Really?
[126:51.01]Threaten me, would you?
[126:53.79]Please.
[126:54.57]I have a family, sir.
[126:55.63]Please.
[126:58.10]I don't care about your family.
[127:02.08]Why did it have to come to this, huh?
[127:07.10]Just tell me.
[127:07.86]I didn't want this either.
[127:09.51]Just tell me.
[127:11.22]Just tell me.
[127:11.92]Tell me.
[127:12.26]I don't want to hurt you, man.
[127:13.94]I've done too much damage.
[127:16.80]I don't want to hurt anybody anymore.
[127:18.98]Oh, fuck.
[127:40.25]Okay, he's mine.
[127:40.57]You borrowed money from my business partner, Herr Strauss.
[127:44.19]You owe him.
[127:45.13]You took the money.
[127:46.29]He wants it back.
[127:47.31]What's not to understand?
[127:51.76]Where's our money?
[127:53.06]I don't have it.
[127:55.50]Sell your place.
[127:56.44]We already owe more than it's worth.
[127:58.61]Then sell your wife or your family or something.
[128:02.59]We ain't your idea of charity!
[128:04.41]Is that clear?
[128:08.72]Thomas!
[128:10.00]What are you looking at?
[128:11.10]Thomas!
[128:12.26]I said, what you looking at, woman?
[128:13.64]My husband isn't well.
[128:15.82]If we could just have more... Like I said, we ain't nobody's idea of charity.
[128:20.00]Get us the money!
[128:33.33]Yeah, I didn't get it.
[128:39.10]What if we're the bad guys?
[128:40.52]Oh, no.
[128:42.24]I think he may have stolen your rifle.
[129:02.31]Oh, yeah, he's sick, yeah.
[129:04.35]He, like, spit in my mouth.
[129:06.07]I'm gonna get the flu.
[129:08.45]I'm gonna get the death flu.
[129:10.53]Alright, back to... back to camp.
[129:29.38]Okay.
[129:30.40]So, what's next?
[129:35.26]They're running out of money here.
[129:39.94]We gotta donate this to the coppers, I think.
[129:52.23]I thought he stole my gun.
[130:00.97]Mission complete.
[130:02.03]Bronze.
[130:29.15]Arthur attempts to reclaim the debt from Thomas Downes, but finds him to be destitute.
[130:33.91]Complete within two minutes.
[130:36.40]Oh, it's because I wouldn't beat him up.
[130:39.14]That's why I got bronze.
[130:42.84]Alright, let's go to the medic wagon here.
[130:46.90]What do we got?
[130:51.49]Health cure.
[130:53.57]I can't take any more.
[130:58.29]How do I bathe at the camp, can I?
[130:59.97]Oh wait, actually, I have meat, don't I?
[131:03.17]Oh, I bought that thing to do upgrades here.
[131:07.36]Kit satchel.
[131:08.82]Okay, I need... Increase the carrying capacity for all types of kit equipment that will be used regularly.
[131:14.04]This one is... Increase the carrying capacity for all types of valuables that can be sold for cash.
[131:21.13]Perfect deer, perfect beaver, perfect rabbit.
[131:26.97]Uh, I'm gonna donate these, though.
[131:30.48]Go to opossum, donate for funds, donate for... any provisions?
[131:37.04]No.
[131:37.82]Oh, this shitty raccoon pouch is great.
[131:40.90]Eh, get rid of the opossum.
[131:46.92]Okay.
[131:47.86]Let's go eat the stew, because it's available.
[131:59.98]I'm trying to get over it.
[132:00.84]I can't.
[132:02.23]I'm trying, guys.
[132:11.75]Let's eat.
[132:16.07]Now slurp it up.
[132:17.22]I want this right now.
[132:24.02]What's with the same joke a hundred times?
[132:26.22]Which one?
[132:30.17]Me?
[132:30.99]Did I say something?
[132:38.14]Oh, you're talking about chat.
[132:39.08]Oh, okay.
[132:43.52]Increase total supplies including tonics to refill all stats as well as higher quality liquors.
[132:52.71]Uh... Total provisions adds fresh fruit and basic canned goods.
[132:58.01]Yeah, let's get this.
[133:00.60]Quality and quantity of food available in the pantry has increased.
[133:03.06]That's good.
[133:07.46]It's not a joke.
[133:08.12]It's cold, hard reality.
[133:12.10]Whatever.
[133:14.49]Real variety.
[133:15.39]How much money do we have?
[133:16.23]Approved repeater ammo and arrows.
[133:20.91]Actually, I like using the arrows.
[133:22.43]48 bucks?
[133:26.51]Yeah, let's do it.
[133:30.31]Quality and quantity of ammunition available at Arthur's Tent has increased.
[133:32.51]You can pay to resupply munitions when stocks are low.
[133:37.59]And then we're pretty much out of money.
[133:43.46]I mean, we're broke, but I'm not broke.
[133:46.56]So don't worry.
[133:48.88]I'll take care of this.
[133:53.42]Let's give some items here.
[133:56.70]Eight bucks.
[134:00.65]Put this one in there.

[134:37.69]Let's take these cartridges, arrows, and everything.
[134:39.83]Alright, I need... I need to take arrows.
[134:49.04]I need a bunch of these, actually, because I used them all.

[135:31.10]I haven't really eaten.
[135:33.88]I had a smoothie this morning and that's it.
[135:37.39]Eventually here, fairly soon, I'm probably going to have to call it night.
[135:41.81]And get some food in me.
[135:46.91]I had a smoothie.
[135:47.71]It was a pineapple, strawberry, and peach smoothie.
[135:51.73]And it was good.
[135:55.03]Alright.
[135:56.31]I'll probably give myself another 45 minutes before it's time to end.
[136:00.98]So with that, give me two seconds.
[136:02.96]I'll see you guys in a minute or two.
[138:55.50]Alright.

[140:40.52]Look at how much better that Arthur's horse is.
[140:44.64]Okay, girl.
[140:45.78]Alright, let's go.
[140:48.91]I'm going to whip my bow and arrow.
[140:51.89]I'm going to get out of town first.
[141:00.59]Bow.
[141:03.77]I need to craft better arrows.
[141:06.05]On horseback, I gotta kill two rabbits.
[141:07.49]The rabbits are over this way.
[141:11.48]What?
[141:14.50]What was that blip?
[141:18.58]Oh, shit.
[141:19.06]It's a snake.
[141:19.82]It's a snake.
[141:20.50]Study, study, study.
[141:22.21]Study it.
[141:25.07]Southern copperhead snake.
[141:30.96]Where is it?
[141:31.34]I don't know where it is.
[141:34.84]Where is it?
[141:38.23]There he is.
[141:53.34]What?
[141:55.92]Did the snake just die of old age?
[141:58.68]How did it- what did it die?
[141:59.74]It hit his head on a rock.
[142:08.14]Okay, he just smashed his head into a fucking rock.
[142:12.62]Alright, well, look at the quality!
[142:16.04]Look at the quality of the meat!
[142:17.54]It's so- it's perfect!
[142:19.04]It's perfect.
[142:19.48]I'm gonna bring it back to town.
[142:22.25]No, what do I do with this?
[142:23.35]It's perfect.
[142:24.43]Look at the three stars.
[142:29.18]What do I do with this?
[142:29.86]It's, uh... Skin it?
[142:40.41]Will it be perfect skin, or should I just keep the whole thing?
[142:46.55]Why?
[142:47.13]Oh.
[142:48.81]Sell to butcher?
[142:49.57]Cargo it?
[142:50.14]Release it back into the wild?
[142:52.40]Just hold it like this for the rest of the game.
[142:57.08]It'll be a perfect skin?
[143:01.19]Alright, here we go.
[143:01.73]I'm going to skin it.
[143:19.54]Oh, man.
[143:20.24]Nice.
[143:20.60]I can make perfect... Okay.
[143:24.02]I'm so glad he smashed his head into a rock.
[143:25.74]I didn't have to shoot it and ruin it.
[143:26.84]Let's put it on the back.
[143:33.25]Do I put it in a... This thing's going to get all fucked up if I drive stupid though, right?
[143:39.00]Okay.
[143:44.38]This is going to rot.
[143:45.74]I need to get rid of this somehow.
[143:46.72]Should I go back to camp?
[143:56.04]Where's like a butcher?
[143:58.73]Not my butcher.
[144:00.57]A butcher that I can actually sell to.
[144:05.99]Put it in the stew pot.
[144:12.10]No.
[144:12.34]Let's go up here.
[144:12.86]I'm going to go up.
[144:14.92]We're going to go up here.
[144:16.04]We're going to do this Mary Linton quest.
[144:18.86]And I'm going to come back and get a rabbit.
[144:23.81]Alright, let's go.
[144:29.33]I want to sell it at the butcher.
[144:30.17]If it's perfect, then I kind of would want to get some money from it.
[144:49.36]ride on the road.
[144:56.33]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[145:00.62]Who the fuck are you?
[145:01.86]Why would you do that?
[145:06.22]Oh, there's people.
[145:07.56]Lots of them.
[145:53.21]Everyone disliked that.
[145:57.48]Well, maybe I get some money.
[145:58.74]Oh, they're all Driscolls.
[146:02.22]I mean, is there a point in this where I get to get rid of all the O'Doyles?
[146:08.35]Can I throw them all off a cliff?
[146:13.57]Edison?
[146:14.33]Okay, not bad.
[146:23.89]Driscoll's rule.
[146:26.65]Seriously.
[146:27.21]That's what I feel like they're doing.
[146:36.08]I don't think I've had the same hat on for more than five minutes.
[146:42.66]They shot my snake?
[146:43.92]Better not have.
[146:45.40]No, it's still there.
[146:45.92]It's fine.
[147:15.90]Speaking of guns, what is that?
[147:21.68]This is a... Worn Cattleman Revolver.
[147:24.90]No.
[147:25.58]That thing sucks.
[147:28.57]So it was Driscolls, and then it was Bounties.
[147:31.15]When are they going to realize that they're not going to take me down?
[147:36.61]They may as well just make me the President.
[147:38.19]You know?
[147:42.34]At what point is it just like, fine, you can be Emperor.
[147:50.96]I go, alright, you're unstoppable.
[147:53.11]You now, like, that's what... Sorry, I'm just writing it to Tony Hawk and show you how cool I was.
[148:22.13]Pay off your bounty?
[148:22.81]I'll do that here.
[148:23.79]Do I have enough money to do that?
[148:26.82]I didn't realize the United States was a monarchy.
[148:29.72]No, but see, you make me the emperor, and then ten of the most loyal, most dedicated generals then work to have me removed.
[148:39.10]And then, you know, while I'm sitting there eating grapes, and sleeping on, like, salted beef, you just, like, throw a fucking dart in my face.
[148:48.19]That's it.
[148:49.01]I'll get fat.
[148:50.47]I'll get overconfident.
[148:56.42]Look at that.
[149:03.44]I'm not selling that though.
[149:04.46]Perfect carcass.
[149:13.02]What are you talking about?
[149:15.34]Just read between the lines.
[149:16.38]1.6. 1.7.
[149:26.20]I can't do anything else with this, so I'll just take it.
[149:29.20]I'm going to keep this, though.
[149:30.15]Does this spoil it all?
[149:34.21]Or is it always going to be perfect?
[149:42.46]Yeah, I'm not going to sell this to this guy.
[149:43.90]Anytime it says use in crafting, I'm not going to sell it.
[149:48.74]I don't really have anything else for you.
[149:57.71]What the hell?
[149:58.55]What the hell?
[150:01.73]Sell to the trapper, not this guy?
[150:03.15]No, that's the skin, though.
[150:04.87]The carcass can't be used for anything.
[150:06.31]Alright, let's go to this one.
[150:11.13]Actually, you know what?
[150:12.69]I'm going to store this guy.
[150:14.18]Actually, hold on a minute.
[150:14.94]Let me at least clean this.
[150:16.12]I'm going to go bring Whisper up.
[150:20.60]You are dirty.
[150:21.42]Hold still, girl.
[150:37.83]Should I be holding this or tapping it?
[150:54.62]Don't pay your bounty, whatever you do.
[150:56.14]Okay, nice and clean.
[151:02.44]Let's get you in storage and bring out Whisper.
[151:10.18]Okay, here's Whisper.
[151:10.74]Saddle up!
[151:11.00]So here's Whisper.
[151:11.66]I think... I hate how I'm saying it.
[151:13.60]Horse care package.
[151:14.22]Alright, that's good.
[151:15.14]You have to stable your horses.
[151:16.92]You can't just overuse them.
[151:21.77]They'll get tired and fucked up.
[151:47.07]I just wanted to knock the board out of his hands.
[151:48.59]I'm not trying to be dick.
[151:50.53]I'm just trying to get the board knocked out of his hands.
[151:57.06]Change the braided tail?
[151:57.88]No, that's how I know it's my horse.
[152:03.56]Your edgy horse.
[152:06.66]Okay.
[152:20.59]Hello?
[152:21.85]We loved once in true.
[152:24.37]No, this is the love interest.
[152:26.67]Oh shit, I forgot to take a bath.
[152:27.65]The braided hair won't get tangled, I know.
[152:32.43]I know.
[152:52.59]Hello, Arthur.
[152:56.13]You look like shit.
[152:57.70]Mary?
[152:58.96]I know, I know.
[153:01.44]I heard you and your friends was around.
[153:03.92]I... Okay.
[153:06.68]Where's, um... Where's what's-his-name?
[153:10.54]Died.
[153:10.97]Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[153:13.95]Yeah, me too.
[153:16.05]Me too.
[153:17.93]Happened a while ago.
[153:20.41]Pneumonia.
[153:21.18]Bad business.
[153:22.34]Sure.
[153:24.72]So, uh, you've been... You've been made a widow and you come here looking for me, is that it?
[153:33.06]No, ain't like that, Arthur.
[153:35.25]Ah, okay.
[153:39.19]Listen, Arthur, I... I'm... My family... I need your help.
[153:48.48]You mean the family that always looked down on me?
[153:51.40]And you want me to help them?
[153:53.30]It's my little brother, Jamie.
[153:54.96]I always liked Jamie.
[153:59.13]At least compared to the rest of them.
[154:06.09]He's broken Daddy's heart.
[154:09.07]don't make me beg you Arthur my money my life me I wasn't good enough I'm sorry this looks like we need your help real bad little jamie's joined the chelonians that strange religious order that rolled around in mud before I walked to the door that's like how fresh that is kill him you're the only person he'd listen to so I'm too rough
[154:34.30]to marry into your family, but it's okay to ask me to help in saving your family.
[154:38.82]I'm sorry.
[154:39.56]I understand if you don't want to help me, but I think of you often.
[154:45.40]No time to go now.
[154:48.40]I'm begging you, Arthur.
[154:50.48]I say let Jamie live Jamie's life and not the nightmare that his daddy dreamed up for him.
[154:55.70]Jamie's so innocent, Arthur.
[154:59.82]Please, Arthur.
[155:04.85]Will you help me?
[155:10.63]I think I got to help her, right?
[155:17.01]I don't know.
[155:17.79]I got to.
[155:18.73]Oh, it's don't help her.
[155:19.69]It's the fur coming up here.
[155:20.81]Please, Arthur.
[155:21.97]Oh, shit.
[155:23.76]The time's running out.
[155:25.06]I'm helping.
[155:25.36]Where is it?
[155:27.27]Somewhere out near Carmody Dell, I think.
[155:29.89]The rancher there said he'd seen him around the Cumberland Forest.
[155:32.75]I need good boy points, guys.
[155:34.25]Don't you understand?
[155:35.19]Arthur, if you find him, bring him to me at the station.
[155:38.83]I'll see what I can do.
[155:40.30]I can't just do everything bad.
[155:41.76]I've done so many bad things.
[155:45.42]You already owe me.
[155:49.94]Good boy points.
[155:53.29]But don't you understand, for every time that we run over a fucking town of people in our car, for every time I shoot my tuba desk at somebody, like on the street, we have to balance it out.
[156:11.78]I have to do a good deed every once in a while, and this is far away, Mary.
[156:31.00]He can't just do all bad things.
[156:40.25]Good day, dear.
[156:41.63]Morning.
[156:43.71]No.
[156:49.32]He's going to be occasionally good, so he doesn't stand for anything.
[157:01.33]The braided tail is messing with your head.
[157:04.29]Why?
[157:10.97]He was thinking about blasting the lady on the porch.
[157:12.89]I could see it.
[157:15.69]And I didn't do it.
[157:21.23]That's not part of my bad guy allowance.
[157:37.38]My horse up and died on me, twisted my ankle something fierce.
[157:40.94]Think you could give me a ride?
[157:42.16]I tried to kill her.
[157:44.70]Oh, thank you, sir.
[157:45.88]Thank you.
[157:48.62]You know Emerald Ranch?
[157:50.94]Mind taking me there?
[157:52.24]Goddammit, I was in the middle of something.
[157:55.16]Glad I ran into you.
[157:57.72]I raised that horse, you know.
[157:59.78]Raised it since it was just a foal.
[158:02.42]Awful Evil?
[158:02.64]I don't know if that's the kind of character I'm playing.
[158:04.24]Awful Evil.
[158:04.70]Evil Knievel.
[158:05.02]Whatever.
[158:05.20]It don't matter.
[158:05.54]Actually, I am kind of playing like Evil Knievel.
[158:06.86]He did a lot of dangerous shit.
[158:07.62]Jumping over stuff.
[158:32.47]Flying over cars, flying over, you know, jumping over branches and stuff like that.
[158:37.13]Had one of them mountain boys pull a gun on me once.
[158:41.07]Dakota and it stopped by a nice warm patch.
[158:49.36]Fuck is that rabbit?
[158:53.90]I mean, if you want to put like lawful evil, evil can evil.
[158:57.60]That would be pretty good.
[158:58.98]Pointing a rusty shotgun straight at me.
[159:02.22]Well, he gets wheezing on and I must have made some sort of noise because... Well, you quit it already.
[159:08.18]I think you might have got twisted.
[159:10.26]What is wrong with you?
[159:11.68]Jump over three obstacles in 15 seconds.
[159:19.58]When does the time start?
[159:20.31]Over the tree.
[159:20.61]Thanks.
[159:30.03]Over the rock.
[159:31.05]You aiming to knock me off?
[159:32.69]Run.
[159:33.89]You live at Emerald Ranch, then?
[159:35.32]Wait, Emerald Ranch is the other way.
[159:37.76]Anyways, right.
[159:40.92]For the time being.
[160:09.75]Jump over three obstacles in 15 seconds!
[160:21.98]That's not part of the balance!
[160:32.24]How do you jump over the... There were three objects in 15 seconds.
[160:38.06]I have to go to, like, a stable for that, though.
[160:40.94]Oh, fucking Jesus Christ.
[160:47.00]Just jump over a fence three times.
[160:48.74]I panicked.
[160:49.70]I saw the fucking text on the screen.
[160:51.22]I thought it was, like, a GT.
[160:52.54]Remember in Grand Theft Auto when they would do the random, like, hey, by the way, pass four people in ten seconds.
[160:58.38]And you're like, oh, shit, oh, nice.
[160:59.63]I thought, I don't know.
[161:08.66]That happens all the time in GTA 5.
[161:11.16]Especially, well, GTA Online, right?
[161:20.20]Yeah, I'm sorry, here.
[161:26.06]GTA, yeah, GTA Online.
[161:31.56]I bet I'm going to meet all the people I've helped in the afterlife.
[161:37.25]No less than the recent rediscovery of theology.
[161:40.81]Gentlemen.
[161:41.17]Is it?
[161:41.29]Well.
[161:44.11]Shell of safety.
[161:47.88]Shell of safety.
[161:50.56]Shell of safety.
[161:51.18]Shell of safety.
[161:51.78]Shell of safety.
[161:53.18]Shell of safety.
[161:54.18]Shell of safety.
[161:56.30]Shell of safety.
[161:57.44]Shell of safety.
[161:59.28]Can I speak to the boy?
[162:01.08]Arthur?
[162:01.78]Hello, son.
[162:03.77]Your sister is very worried.
[162:06.64]The boy has chosen a path, sir.
[162:08.88]Cultist shield.
[162:09.92]The path to truth.
[162:10.72]Okay, let's see.
[162:11.18]Guy on the left.
[162:11.74]Guy on the back is the most intimidating back left.
[162:15.00]His sister just wants to speak with him.
[162:17.20]Arthur, I've chosen a path.
[162:20.80]Yeah, that's the big group.
[162:22.42]The boy has chosen a path.
[162:24.48]He's chosen safety.
[162:27.36]What path have you chosen, sir?
[162:29.74]I don't know.
[162:36.75]I don't know about this nonsense let me speak to the boy are you always this negative and antagonistic sir I'm sorry I'm not a very cultured man forgive me please I am a fool for my god and a happy one sir I bless you he's gone no what do I dream about
[163:06.73]Who are my heroes?
[163:10.23]Uh... Spider-Man.
[163:14.70]Fools.
[163:16.28]You're a fool for everyone's god.
[163:18.36]You're a maniac.
[163:19.54]Now let me talk to the goddamn boy!
[163:27.60]Oh, no.
[163:28.44]Throttle?
[163:29.22]What does throttle mean?
[163:33.40]Goddamn lunatic.
[163:40.76]That's enough, Arthur!
[163:42.26]Now, kid, come on.
[163:43.96]This is crap.
[163:44.94]You're better than this.
[163:45.95]Better than what?
[163:47.41]Better than wanting Paradise?
[163:48.93]Better than thinking these fools know a damn thing about Paradise.
[163:53.41]Now, let me take you home.
[163:54.59]You're a sad man, Arthur.
[163:56.43]You're a real sad man.
[163:58.40]Sure.
[163:59.24]Come home.
[164:00.02]Not a chance!
[164:13.68]They're gonna outrun Whispers.
[164:18.82]My horse is way fucking faster than yours, ain't it?
[164:26.53]Oh, hey!
[164:32.98]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!
[164:41.17]Why are they throwing all these obstacles in my way?
[164:43.24]Get out of the fucking way.
[165:15.87]I wasn't gonna kill him, I'm kidding.
[165:17.47]I obviously have to lasso him.
[165:21.77]I'm just gonna get close to him.
[165:22.79]Sorry I didn't understand that there's gonna be a lookout for the obstacle on the road.
[165:26.70]Of course he gets by it.
[165:28.66]They're just using you!
[165:32.98]Telling you what you want to hear!
[165:35.12]What the hell do you know about it?
[165:42.15]I tried to run him over!
[165:44.45]Just get on with it!
[166:05.31]He's too far away.
[166:06.93]I can't get him.
[166:08.31]I have the fastest horse I can hit in the game.
[166:29.69]Two.
[166:29.89]Of course I can die.
[166:30.75]If I got...
[167:02.57]Not a good idea.
[167:07.21]Not a good idea.
[167:13.13]Please, Arthur.
[167:14.69]I'm a man now.
[167:16.21]I found something.
[167:18.09]A calling.
[167:19.45]You're just a kid.
[167:20.67]You're making a big mistake.
[167:23.09]I'm not taking advice from you.
[167:25.65]You're an outlaw.
[167:27.39]You leave me alone!
[167:28.47]What'd he say?
[167:29.19]They're good people!
[167:30.71]I'm warning you, Arthur Morgan!
[167:35.25]Now you're fucked.
[167:35.95]Leave me alone!
[167:38.07]Please, kid.
[167:40.96]Put that gun down.
[167:44.12]I warned you, Arthur!
[167:45.62]I'm... I'm gonna... What are we doing?
[167:48.42]I don't wanna live anymore!
[167:50.28]What are we doing?
[167:51.36]Leave me alone!
[167:55.89]Slowly press R2 to fill the meter.
[167:56.99]The more to fill the meter, the... What?
[167:59.07]Slowly... I warn you, Arthur!
[168:14.83]I'm... Let me read this again.
[168:16.97]Hold on, I freaked out.
[168:17.93]What is he telling me?
[168:18.70]Lord?
[168:18.84]Leave me alone!
[168:24.98]Slowly press R2 to fill the meter.
[168:27.34]The more the meter... Now calm down!
[168:40.12]Okay, I need to like do that again.
[168:41.36]Let's go see your sister.
[168:42.50]Okay.
[168:42.80]Okay.
[168:52.27]Okay, kid.
[168:53.09]You can't.
[168:54.39]You can't.
[168:55.35]You can't do it.
[168:56.31]I'm gonna do it.
[168:59.56]I don't know.
[169:01.14]I don't know enough about it.
[169:02.64]Jesus.
[169:04.76]One thing I do know.
[169:07.30]Is he gonna give him the gun back?
[169:10.49]I'll miss you, Arthur.
[169:11.99]I don't know if I would give that back to him.
[169:13.77]Oh, no.
[169:17.73]That's all a long time ago, son.
[169:21.46]Let's go.
[169:22.86]We're on my horse, right?
[169:23.84]Good.
[169:24.30]Well, this wasn't how I thought today would turn out.
[169:28.17]It's been a long time, Jamie Gillis.
[169:31.49]You were a kid last time I saw you.
[169:34.37]Didn't try to kill yourself.
[169:36.35]You know, you taught me how to ride a horse.
[169:40.09]Too well, apparently.
[169:42.53]It's lonelier, though.
[169:44.37]Really?
[169:45.45]You'd fall for that?
[169:47.07]They were very nice to me.
[169:49.76]They're decent.
[169:51.08]I'm sure.
[169:52.60]Please tell me you didn't give them any money.
[169:55.66]Desk tuba is not gone.
[169:57.18]It's right here.
[169:59.16]Of course I did.
[170:00.16]They rely on charitable donations.
[170:03.63]Jesus, Jamie, come on.
[170:06.59]I just wanted to believe that there might be something good coming my way one day.
[170:09.99]Guess that's dead in the water.
[170:12.05]Let's get up there.
[170:16.41]All father kept telling me was, you won't amount to anything.
[170:19.96]You're not enough of a man.
[170:21.50]I had to get away.
[170:23.23]I couldn't take it anymore.
[170:25.14]Forgive me, but your father's a bully and a coward.
[170:28.84]Don't listen to him.
[170:30.38]Hey, don't talk about him like that.
[170:32.56]What do you want me to say, Jamie?
[170:34.86]He's your good father?
[170:35.86]Nice man?
[170:37.98]He won't be happy I saw you.
[170:40.22]Please send him my worst regards.
[170:42.92]Jump three obstacles.
[170:44.20]I'm not going to do that right now.
[170:45.96]I'm not good at anything.
[170:47.46]I'm going to get to a fence and then get it done.
[170:50.44]Tell me something you like.
[170:51.87]Uh-huh.
[170:54.74]Don't think too hard.
[170:55.94]Don't fall here.
[170:56.62]Apples, I guess.
[170:58.18]You like apples?
[170:59.54]Yeah, I love apples.
[171:01.64]Okay.
[171:02.24]I was thinking more along the lines of... Somebody's got to love apples, you know?
[171:06.05]People don't own apple farms.
[171:07.39]You've got to really love them.
[171:08.29]Where do you think your apples come from?
[171:10.07]That's respectable.
[171:11.13]That's nice.
[171:14.41]I only like shooting young idiots who run away from me when I'm trying to help them.
[171:19.37]Father told me what you do.
[171:21.55]I'm sure he did.
[171:23.77]Are you still with Dutch and... What was his name?
[171:26.63]Hester?
[171:27.57]Jose.
[171:28.45]Yep, still the same, sort of.
[171:31.27]And Annabelle and Bessie?
[171:33.45]I'm afraid they're dead.
[171:35.61]Shit.
[171:36.05]Doesn't count.
[171:37.05]Maybe Mary did make the right choice.
[171:40.07]No doubt.
[171:41.97]But none of it is anything like the nonsense you read in the newspapers.
[171:47.26]So, are you two getting back together?
[171:49.29]I told you, no.
[171:52.33]Just ask me for a favor.
[171:54.45]You know where he lives and is dead?
[171:55.91]Pneumonia.
[171:58.33]You told me.
[171:59.60]So the door is open, so to speak.
[172:02.22]That's all in the past.
[172:04.72]Different people now.
[172:06.62]She's not.
[172:07.92]You seem just the same.
[172:09.81]Well, maybe that right there is the problem.
[172:12.93]She was always too good for me.
[172:15.28]Let's just get you back to your sister.
[172:17.02]She's waiting at the station for us.
[172:20.54]Meet Mary at the station.
[172:22.00]She must be waiting inside.
[172:27.37]Hello.
[172:32.81]Mary, I brought your son.
[172:35.83]Wait, are we going a long way?
[172:37.66]You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?
[172:41.74]He's going a long way here.
[172:44.73]You alright?
[172:45.19]Why is he limping around?
[172:46.15]Okay, come on.
[172:46.57]Alright, here's your rotten kid.
[173:05.15]Because he shot his hand.
[173:05.93]I didn't shoot his hand.
[173:06.85]I didn't even touch his hand.
[173:07.99]It hit the gun.
[173:09.21]Jamie.
[173:10.67]Jamie.
[173:11.23]Alright.
[173:12.65]Finally, mother and son reunited.
[173:14.39]Please, you've... Father's been very sad.
[173:18.07]Your father wouldn't know sadness if it died in his bed.
[173:20.63]He's not happy.
[173:22.49]But I'll come home for you.
[173:24.45]My boy.
[173:25.75]My sweet boy.
[173:28.16]Come on.
[173:28.52]Oh, Arthur.
[173:31.08]Arthur.
[173:32.95]Thank you.
[173:34.57]Thank you.
[173:35.15]It's good to see you, Mary.
[173:38.37]And you, Arthur.
[173:40.27]And you.
[173:40.81]Have a good one.
[173:46.72]No, don't skip.
[173:59.19]I've... You're...
[174:02.23]You don't have to say anything.
[174:03.03]I'm going to long scope you from like a half mile away when you get on the train.
[174:06.30]Don't worry about it.
[174:30.69]Feel like...
[174:32.20]The luckiest man alive and I feel like a fool.
[174:37.52]That woman confuses me and plays me for a fiddle like no one else alive.
[174:43.86]I trust I will not make a god awful fool of myself once more, but somehow I imagine I shall.
[174:53.71]Somehow.
[174:57.47]Here we go.
[174:58.45]Bronze?
[175:05.42]There.
[175:08.56]Okay.
[175:09.84]So, ladies and gentlemen.
[175:12.37]I need to go take out Otto.
[175:13.69]I gotta get some food.
[175:15.95]We've got... We've been going for seven plus hours here.
[175:19.13]I think it's a good stopping point.
[175:21.57]Internet has held up very well.
[175:24.20]So... I... I'm probably just gonna go tomorrow.
[175:29.48]You know what I'm saying?
[175:34.20]Try to keep this going.
[175:35.88]Because we've got... Yeah, it was before the... I turned the stream up before we did Starplane Lethally.
[175:50.41]But yeah.
[175:52.15]This looks pretty promising so far.
[175:55.93]It's been very solid tonight.
[175:57.69]I think he's only dropped 100 frames over six, seven hours.
[176:02.04]That's pretty great, actually.
[176:04.50]Show auto.
[176:05.18]I mean, hold on.
[176:07.02]He's downstairs.
[176:08.48]He's downstairs.
[176:09.30]He's like asleep downstairs.
[176:10.64]I really don't know.
[176:11.74]I'm going to let him just hang out down there.
[176:13.99]I don't want to like wake him up, bring him up here, and then bring him all the way.
[176:16.53]No.
[176:18.81]I'll show him tomorrow.
[176:21.05]with, uh, if this, if we still have a solid internet connection here, then tomorrow I'll, I'm just gonna stream, I'm gonna get up, eat some food, grab a coffee, and I'm just gonna get going.
[176:30.47]We'll just start.
[176:34.77]Hopefully it's, uh, our problems are in the past.
[176:40.51]Same lame excuse in Boston?
[176:42.39]What, like, I wanna let my dog sleep?
[176:43.90]I don't wanna, like, drag him up here and, like, put him in front of a camera?
[176:48.52]What?
[176:49.34]What?
[176:49.94]What?
[176:52.38]He's just like sleeping.
[176:53.76]He's being like a good boy.
[176:57.48]Excuses.
[176:58.26]Alright.
[177:00.66]Let me... I'm going to switch off here.
[177:04.77]If you're taking off, take care.
[177:06.07]Hopefully we see you tomorrow.
[177:09.67]I'm going to try to stream again.
[177:10.81]And with that, let's run the... Let's run the bits here.
[177:22.28]Let's see.
[177:22.84]We've got to turn this off.
[177:24.24]Hey, look at that.
[177:24.91]There's an outro.
[177:25.87]That's an intro.
[177:26.47]That's the wrong thing.
[177:27.21]That's an outro.
[177:30.25]I can turn that off.
[177:31.95]Okay.
[177:33.61]So, thanks, everybody.
[177:36.49]See you soon.
[177:40.19]And let's get to these bits.
[177:41.21]But first, I need to text Kim.
[177:44.19]She is asking me a question.
[177:49.07]Okay.
[177:49.75]Answered question.
[177:51.83]So let's go back down to a long time ago here.
[177:54.29]We got this seven hours ago.

[179:31.82]Hey, Jerma, in celebration of the 100th Garf Buck, is it okay if Garf sings you a victory song?
[179:37.80]Yeah, that's fine.
[179:39.61]He lives in my scarf.
[179:40.85]The twinkle in my barf.
[179:42.07]He gives me what a perfect garf.
[179:44.07]At any point in time or history, Odie's done.
[179:46.24]John is done.
[179:47.82]Garf's the cat.
[179:48.44]He's so cool.
[179:49.14]He's so nice.
[179:49.78]Everything about him is great.
[179:51.74]Who's that flying in the sky?
[179:52.76]It's Goff on a motorcycle in the sky.
[179:55.63]There he goes, gorfing around in front of your face.
[179:57.43]Home on a journey to outer space.
[179:58.71]Oh, I get it.
[180:06.00]Thank you, Garfield, for the Monday dollar.
[180:08.27]Is it Monday?
[180:09.79]No, not yet.
[180:10.83]It'll be Monday in like... Well, actually, it's probably Monday for a lot of people here.
[180:13.75]We're on Pacific time.
[180:16.09]So thank you, Garfield.
[180:19.53]Thank you also to Hydra.
[180:22.07]Thank you, Hydra725 for the $1.
[180:23.81]Lego Island for Evo Comedy Hour.
[180:27.23]Thanks, dude.
[180:28.51]Tuskore13, thanks for the $1.
[180:31.35]Honestly, I missed you two being friends.
[180:32.93]These streams always make me forget my troubles.
[180:34.72]Lots of love to you both.
[180:36.29]That was a great time.
[180:38.18]That was a lot of fun.
[180:39.38]There's a couple other games that him and I both would like to play.
[180:43.10]Just need to figure out how to do them.
[180:45.68]Should be fun.
[180:47.70]Pacific time is three hours behind.
[180:49.16]Well, yeah, that's what I mean.
[180:50.54]8, 9, 10, 11.
[180:50.96]It's 1130 Eastern.
[180:53.32]So in 30 minutes, it'll be Monday.
[180:55.76]Not over here, though.
[180:58.69]But thanks a lot, Tusk.
[181:01.25]Tar Alacrin, thanks for the $2 here.
[181:03.75]Dermot, you can drop the act.
[181:04.78]No one believes you actually moved to Vegas.
[181:06.60]It's pretty obvious you just moved your setup to a different room closer to the Wi-Fi router.
[181:14.54]Man, wouldn't that be weird?
[181:15.64]Closer to the Wi-Fi router.
[181:22.28]Thank you.
[181:24.54]Thank you, Optimus, for the $1, Optimus 27,000.
[181:28.75]This stream really makes you feel like it's 2014.
[181:31.79]The days of Jerva versus Star.
[181:33.45]Bets, pirate spies, and demonic chefs.
[181:37.26]Good to be back.
[181:39.68]We never left.
[181:41.88]Never left, man.
[181:42.46]We're here.
[181:45.98]I didn't go anywhere.
[181:46.58]He didn't go anywhere.
[181:48.66]It's all good.
[181:52.16]Thank you.
[181:52.46]Fourth consecutive line for the $5.00.
[181:55.40]Damn, this stream reminded me of the good old days.
[181:57.27]Hope you stream with Stirr more often.
[181:59.81]I'm sure we will.
[182:01.57]There's no reason not to.
[182:03.39]Just need to find the right game, the right time, the right moment, organically, like I told you before.
[182:08.21]There's no rhyme or reason to when I play with somebody else.
[182:10.80]It just kind of happens.
[182:12.02]But thanks for the $5, man.
[182:12.74]Appreciate it.

[182:40.99]I don't know.
[182:44.08]Did they win?

[183:39.05]Chat stole your gun.
[183:48.42]You know, like those moments where you...
[183:51.18]I just know I'll never live it down ever again.
[183:54.46]And it's live.
[183:56.12]I can't, like, go back and fix that.
[183:58.00]You know what I mean?
[183:59.06]If this was YouTube, I'd be like, oh, shit, that was really fucking bad.
[184:04.63]That was really fucked up and stupid.
[184:06.17]Oh, I was gonna go delete it.
[184:08.27]Nope.
[184:10.99]That's gonna take me, like, a month to live that one down.
[184:17.28]But thank you, Blue Comet, for the 10 bucks.
[184:19.13]Appreciate it.
[184:20.93]Little Money Larry gave $15 here.

[184:27.57]You look like shit.
[184:28.39]Perfect timing.
[184:29.21]I snotted.
[184:29.83]That was great.
[184:30.93]And then they say blood for blood.
[184:34.37]God.
[184:36.57]What?
[184:38.77]But thank you, though.
[184:41.64]A month?
[184:42.08]Keep dreaming.
[184:42.50]It's going to take five years.
[184:46.34]God.
[184:49.71]He just wanted a hug.
[184:50.85]I know, but like the way that he reached around and then it wasn't on my back anymore.
[184:56.29]And who knows, there's all kinds of weird characters and weird fucked up scenarios.
[185:00.16]It could have happened.
[185:04.06]Chad is still on Coffee Cheetos Chicken.
[185:06.08]What are you on about?
[185:08.00]Oh, that's right.
[185:10.02]Okay, so that one, if Coffee Cheetos Chicken like finally like at the end of its life, like two years from now is done, then this one's going to be 10 years.
[185:19.78]I just said it.
[185:20.80]And now it just resets the time.
[185:22.50]So I just gave it another five years.
[185:25.56]Every time it's mentioned, the clock resets.
[185:31.58]And then at the end here, thank you, Snatchy, for the $1.
[185:35.31]I bet she's going to meet all the other people you've helped in the afterlife.
[185:38.05]Mentioned that before.
[185:38.75]That was a funny comment.
[185:41.05]And at the very end, thank you, eCookie, for the $1.
[185:45.01]Can you watch and react to your 500 subscriber special?
[185:49.20]No, I've done... I've done it like three times.
[185:53.03]I can't.
[185:55.91]You wanna... No, I'm not... I'm not gonna give any ideas.
[186:00.83]Nope.
[186:01.43]I'm gonna close my mouth on that one.
[186:05.25]You wanna... You wanted me to watch... You want me to watch that?
[186:10.10]Hmm.
[186:10.74]I wonder how that would be possible.
[186:16.62]Oh, I'm not... I don't want... No!
[186:20.56]Guys, the old shitty annotations about me correcting the amount of pounds it is.
[186:25.81]These are 35 pound dumbbells.
[186:27.23]It's 30 actually.
[186:27.81]I'm sorry.
[186:28.25]I lied.
[186:30.17]Those annotations are still there.
[186:35.06]But that's it for the bits.
[186:36.44]Thank you, everybody.
[186:38.48]for your monetary contributions.
[186:42.86]Thanks for the bits, everybody.
[186:44.40]You guys all rock.
[186:46.18]And let's go ahead and throw the credits up on the screen.
[186:49.18]I got a feeling it's going to be a lot.
[186:50.58]It's going to probably be going real fast.
[186:53.41]But thank you regardless to everybody that subscribes to the channel.
[186:56.21]You guys are all amazing.
[186:58.23]And here it comes.
[187:02.01]Thank you for supporting the stream, all you guys.
[187:07.56]I just locked up when I looked at it.
[187:09.24]Fucking goddammit, man.
[187:10.22]It's been a long time.
[187:12.04]Thank you.
[187:14.50]I just was staring.
[187:15.56]That's why I don't do webcam.
[187:18.17]If the webcam was on... Thank you, everybody.
[187:26.85]I went like this.
[187:27.61]No, I'm not going to turn it on yet.
[187:28.85]I want to see everybody.
[187:32.49]You guys are all amazing.
[187:34.87]Hello, tall streamer.
[187:35.95]Thanks, man.
[187:41.67]Why is my music not on?
[187:43.39]What the fuck?
[187:46.07]So what was the green screen update?
[187:47.16]I missed it.
[187:49.16]I will reiterate it one more time.
[187:53.74]But I want to give the subs some time to go by here.
[188:05.03]All of you.
[188:08.43]When I came back, actually streaming, three days or so, it was like 300 or 400 subs.
[188:18.26]Were a lot of you guys just saving it to when I actually came back?
[188:26.26]At what point were you like, okay, I'm gonna wait until he comes back.
[188:30.55]He ain't back.
[188:32.65]What the fuck is he doing?
[188:37.70]I feel stuff like in people... I remember like October, like all of October, I barely streamed just because of all this.
[188:44.46]You know, moving and everything, and I... People still paid for that whole month of subscriptions.
[188:49.78]Tons of you guys.
[188:51.01]So... And I didn't really do very much, so... Thank you for your patience.
[189:00.33]Thanks for... Continuing to support the stream, even when the stream ain't even turned on.
[189:05.09]So, that means a lot.
[189:16.02]But it seems like we are back in the saddle, judging by all the testing that we did yesterday and then today.
[189:26.15]Let's hope that it's a done deal.
[189:33.17]I can't afford it every month.
[189:35.53]You don't have to be subbed, man.
[189:38.12]Make sure you take care of yourself first.
[189:39.24]Make sure that anything that you give to me is something that you can afford.
[189:44.93]Something that you are completely comfortable doing.
[189:50.55]Oh shit, it auto-subbed.
[189:51.71]Can I get a refund?
[189:52.97]That was a lot of people.
[190:00.22]Thank you so much.
[190:05.35]I'm a poor university student.
[190:06.67]I can't afford something, which is why I look forward to survey bits to show my support.
[190:11.43]That's perfectly fine, man.
[190:12.87]Thank you for even doing that.
[190:18.75]There's no obligation for you to continuously give me money.
[190:25.11]I appreciate anything that you would even say.
[190:28.99]So, thank you.
[190:31.45]Triple Jupiter.
[190:32.23]Holy shit.
[190:34.99]That looks... You got it.
[190:37.48]What's with the spacing here, though?
[190:38.80]Is that an emote problem?
[190:41.54]Oh, no.
[190:41.78]It was a dash.
[190:42.40]Okay.
[190:44.16]Only a few days until Hitman 2.
[190:45.88]Well, I better... There's so many things to do.
[190:49.63]There's so much to do.
[190:51.13]This is what happens when you don't stream for a month.
[190:53.83]So many fucking things come out.
[190:55.01]So many things that I have backlogged.
[191:00.33]The end of the year here will be a lot of fun.
[191:02.72]There's a lot to do.
[191:04.32]But I am going to take off.
[191:06.40]Right at the very end, mostly loss came in with a dollar.
[191:08.24]Oops, this was the last dollar in my bank account.
[191:10.10]Whoa, that's not good.
[191:12.55]Thank you, though.
[191:14.69]Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the one dollar.
[191:17.55]You're a special streamer.
[191:18.63]Return my heart.
[191:20.99]And this is an image of me... Oh, what?
[191:27.88]Why is...
[191:31.04]I'll just be eating the microphone.
[191:32.24]Okay.
[191:33.50]Why does it just link that?
[191:34.90]I just linked that.
[191:35.64]Why did I do that?
[191:38.22]I... Whatever.
[191:39.82]Thank you, eCookie, for the $1 at the end here.
[191:41.45]Do 4,000 subs special.
[191:45.05]Like, on Twitch?
[191:47.79]I don't have 4,000 subs on Twitch, if that's what you're referring to.
[191:54.79]But, thank you.
[191:56.85]Came pretty close.
[191:57.63]There was, like, a month or two ago?
[192:00.69]Like, before I moved?
[192:02.71]Holy shit.
[192:04.51]I think we got real close to it.
[192:06.05]If not, maybe we went over for one day or something.
[192:11.96]But... And that's just fucking out of this world.
[192:15.36]I can't even imagine that.
[192:17.16]But, how do you check my subs?
[192:19.68]I think...
[192:22.66]He has 3900.
[192:22.96]Uh, I do not have 3900.
[192:24.98]That was during the spicy move.
[192:32.86]Hey, why are you ending the stream?
[192:33.95]I just got here, asshole.
[192:34.99]Hey, whoa, man!
[192:36.03]Oh my goodness.
[192:39.71]What the hell is this?
[192:40.47]Hey, you got like an 8-hour VOD that's ready to go.
[192:43.09]And hey, that was two full different games here.
[192:46.09]It was me and Ster playing Lethal League, which was a lot of fun, and then some Red Dead Redemption 2.
[192:50.57]Man, you got like 8 hours here, man.
[192:54.24]permaban no alright I will see you guys tomorrow oh uh Garfield here Garfield the Monday kill thanks to the one dollar Garfield I made a comic for you and for holy mac let's see what it is good morning holy mac alright good morning to you poshito who the fuck is this love me love my mask what is this
[193:22.12]I saw a guy call you bad earlier and you banned him.
[193:25.48]Well, I mean, for those of you that are new to the channel, I, um... The permanent ban, a life ban.
[193:33.04]If I denominate a permanent life ban, it's 15 seconds.
[193:36.18]That's a life sentence.
[193:38.91]So, if you're new to the channel, that's what happens.
[193:46.85]Trevor doesn't know how to read.
[193:55.11]find some treasure next time.
[193:56.69]Yeah, we'll do some side content tomorrow.
[194:00.97]But I will try to find some treasures.
[194:02.55]We'll do some hunting.
[194:05.53]I'll try to start at some point in the afternoon.
[194:07.57]Again, like I've said before, the schedule is just throw it out the window for now.
[194:11.83]Until I have the 100% all clear that the internet is 100% fixed and ready to go, I mean, I still don't have that information.
[194:22.80]The Cox tech guy that I've been talking to has been all over it and on top of it.
[194:27.20]But there's no confirmation here yet that, oh, hey, by the way, it's actually done.
[194:32.19]Once that's done and once that's completely, we're in the complete clear, I'm going to have a new schedule.
[194:36.59]So we'll figure it out.
[194:40.38]Have a great rest of your night, guys.
[194:41.30]Take care.
[194:41.60]I'm going to go eat food, let my dog out, and say hello to my girlfriend.
[194:46.03]I think she's downstairs.
[194:50.23]Take care, guys.
[194:50.71]Have a great rest of your night.
