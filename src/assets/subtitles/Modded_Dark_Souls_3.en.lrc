[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.39]I remember yesterday.
[00:04.03]I remember yesterday.
[00:05.01]Remember when I said yesterday that, you know, I really want to start at around like 3 o'clock.
[00:14.99]It is the exact same time that I started yesterday's stream.
[00:21.11]3.50 p.m.
[00:23.47]Pacific time.
[00:24.33]The exact same time.
[00:26.03]Alright, my new schedule.
[00:29.01]3.50 p.m.
[00:29.47]Pacific.
[00:31.25]Apparently, is how that has to be.
[00:37.68]No, the reason why we started later today is because I gave chat a choice.
[00:42.44]Either an on-time stream at 3, or delay a little, and instead of Dragon's Dogma, set up the Insane Dark Souls 3 mods.
[00:56.49]And that's what I did.
[00:58.11]So tonight we're going to go through a handful, about 5 to 10.
[01:03.34]And maybe we'll have them on at the same time.
[01:04.88]Maybe we won't.
[01:05.46]Maybe I'll just try to beat the game in first person.
[01:10.40]There are a few that are on this list here.
[01:14.71]But, first things first.
[01:17.41]We're gonna try to beat, no we're not, don't say that, that's a complete lie.
[01:22.43]We're going to play Dark Souls 3 in first person.
[01:27.46]It's a first person mod for the game.
[01:30.62]We are going to beat Dark Souls 3 in, uh, no.
[01:34.56]I'll be lucky to get out of the tutorial zone.
[01:41.38]Am I going to suck at this game?
[01:43.12]If you're a new viewer, I have beat Dark Souls 3 on stream twice.
[01:49.75]It's a running gag on the channel, apparently.
[01:56.61]I streamed all of Dark Souls 3 when it first came out.
[01:59.67]Had a great time.
[02:03.55]So level 75, by the way.
[02:07.02]Give me a minute.
[02:07.74]I'll be right back.
[02:10.32]Just make sure this actually loads correctly, and I will see you guys in a minute.
[03:30.14]Okay.
[03:32.94]So, here we are.
[03:34.96]Dark Souls 3.
[03:35.74]Everything looks pretty normal.
[03:36.91]Alright, what if I was just lying to you guys?
[03:40.71]And I actually just loaded up Dark Souls 3.
[03:42.37]And I'm just going to play Dark Souls 3 again.
[03:47.37]That would be pretty dumb, actually.
[03:49.83]Because I already did it.
[03:51.47]I streamed this game like 12 times.
[03:54.38]So that would probably be... I don't know if I'd want to do that.
[03:57.94]New game.
[04:00.57]Yes.
[04:00.99]Oh, whatever.
[04:01.89]Alright.
[04:04.29]Let's get a character here.
[04:07.67]So, for the purposes of first person mode, I think we have to have a very heavy character.
[04:14.97]Dodge rolling might become impossible.
[04:18.91]I'm going to need to be able to take hits.
[04:21.15]A lot of them.
[04:22.21]We're going to do shield.
[04:23.17]I'm getting the biggest fucking shield in the game.
[04:25.47]And I'm going to hold it up the whole time.
[04:30.05]So, let's get a good name here for somebody that's not gonna dodge a roll, that's gonna eat hits.
[04:48.56]No, not Poop Master.
[04:52.79]We got, like, our poop out of our system last night.
[04:57.09]Enemy, well, in other ways, too.
[05:00.31]I'm sure a lot of you did.
[05:01.33]Just name him The Wall.
[05:07.45]No, what?
[05:10.97]Aimless Dickhead.
[05:11.89]How about, uh... No, I'm not gonna name him another meme.
[05:23.26]That's not how it works.
[05:30.63]Somebody said, oh my god, I have homework to do.
[05:38.31]No, that's not funny.
[05:53.36]Do I really have to name this character homework?
[05:57.40]How about homework...
[06:04.96]I'm not gonna name him, he should be.
[06:12.19]Homework Simpson.
[06:13.45]No.
[06:14.03]No.
[06:14.59]No.
[06:15.11]How about... Alright, I got one.
[06:18.01]I got one.
[06:18.41]This is gonna be it.
[06:19.11]No matter what it is, I don't care if I don't like it.
[06:29.46]How about that?
[06:30.46]That's kinda good.
[06:37.68]The hiccups.
[06:46.09]I hate it.
[06:56.54]Don't you hate it when you get fucking hiccups when you're doing your homework?
[07:06.16]Okay, this is important.
[07:07.36]Class.
[07:08.92]I need a shitload of endurance... Who has the highest endurance base?
[07:19.73]It's the Warrior.
[07:20.63]Warrior has the highest base endurance.
[07:27.17]Why the... I mean, I guess I could... Deprived...
[07:33.78]I... This is first person mode, guys.
[07:44.26]So, no, no, it's... Wait, I haven't played Dark Souls 3 in a while.
[07:46.96]Is it... Is... Vigor... Weight?
[07:51.49]Or is Endurance Weight?
[07:53.33]They all put weight up, don't they?
[07:55.13]Oh, no, that's Resistance.
[08:00.03]No, Vigor is Health.
[08:08.99]So just, I'm going to do, okay, that's not a bad idea.
[08:11.52]Do this and just dump every point into, in turn, strength and HP.
[08:20.86]Vitality is weight.
[08:23.48]Oh, right, right, okay, okay, okay.
[08:24.74]Well, there we go, knight.
[08:29.69]It's definitely going to be knight.
[08:44.22]Just making an FPS.
[08:47.70]Knight's probably the best pick.
[08:48.94]I mean, yes, I understand.
[08:50.32]This is like what everybody does.
[08:51.98]I didn't pick this when I first played, but I'm doing something very specific.
[08:55.61]We're doing Knight.
[09:00.33]He already starts with heavy armor.
[09:01.55]He's got a shield already.
[09:02.95]Guys, I might not even make it past the third enemy of the game.
[09:12.13]Alright, we're gonna go with, uh, what do we want here?
[09:18.49]Probably the Life Ring.
[09:21.19]Appearance.
[09:22.05]This doesn't matter.
[09:32.26]Okay.
[09:34.00]That's fine.
[09:43.03]It's doing ResidentSleeper for night.
[09:52.24]Yeah, but look at all that vitality.
[09:56.50]It's gotta be night.
[09:58.28]Look, I don't have to be the actual night, but I need a shield right now.
[10:04.67]Let's go.
[10:05.01]Now this might take a little bit of tweaking.
[10:13.93]Because I tried to make it correct.
[10:16.69]We're gonna see how bad this looks.
[10:21.45]Is this your first Dark Souls?
[10:23.35]This is my first ever playthrough of Dark Souls!
[10:36.63]Already off the bat I feel more comfortable because I have shield.
[10:45.17]Nice arms.
[10:46.36]Dude, it's like a VR game, come on.
[10:50.00]This is going to be so hard, I can already tell.
[10:52.00]Roll?
[10:53.68]Ooh!
[10:54.96]You actually can dodge roll.
[11:00.07]I'm not going to use it though, because how the fuck am I going to dodge roll?
[11:02.07]I don't even know, I, where, okay, first enemy.
[11:07.29]Can I, can you lock on?
[11:09.12]Oh, you can't lock on.
[11:10.70]I don't even know what direction I'm facing.
[11:17.54]This is gonna be so terrifying.
[11:18.80]Alright, we're gonna go this way.
[11:23.74]Easy.
[11:24.12]Yeah, you say that now, but I can't lock onto enemies.
[11:27.72]I'm gonna have to play the whole game without locking on.
[11:30.61]Well, first item!
[11:40.31]Dude, this is actually really, really fucking cool.
[11:44.12]This changes the whole game.
[11:48.76]It's a controller for an FPL.
[11:50.16]I forgot about that guy.
[11:53.68]What?!
[11:54.24]Oh my god!
[11:59.39]Parry or bad?
[12:00.45]Just let me take in the world for a second.
[12:02.87]This is my first time ever playing Dark Souls.
[12:12.92]Parry or bad?
[12:17.81]It's so different seeing it from this angle.
[12:21.21]Oh my god, it's so hard.
[12:24.21]I can't do it.
[12:28.03]No, don't die at the fucking tutorial enemy.
[12:39.31]Seeing it from a different perspective.
[12:41.87]This changes everything.
[12:43.03]I'm gonna have to relearn how to play the whole game.
[12:51.41]Space is an issue too.
[12:53.75]Because I don't have to get that close.
[12:54.87]I'm getting way too close than I need to.
[12:56.51]Did I miss any items?
[13:02.40]I think so.
[13:04.68]There's people over here.
[13:05.52]Let me see the space, the distance here.
[13:09.64]Look at that.
[13:11.50]Oh my god.
[13:13.44]Got it.
[13:25.07]Control, wait, yeah, I can't use the mouse, don't you, you know what I mean?
[13:28.65]There is no mouse control.
[13:30.11]I have to be, it's got to be console FPS.
[13:34.66]For the very specific reason that the mouse does not do the thing that you want it to do.
[13:43.46]The motion blur is fucking my mind.
[13:45.48]Hold on, wait.
[13:46.00]Is that, is that an option I can turn off?
[13:58.15]Alright, I'm gonna turn it off.
[14:01.54]Motion blur off.
[14:04.80]That's better.
[14:11.72]Turn depth of field off, too.
[14:13.44]Yeah, that's true, because it doesn't matter.
[14:15.06]Because depth of field, yeah, that's true.
[14:20.48]Depth of field off.
[14:22.96]Motion blur off.
[14:25.31]Water surface quality, high.
[14:27.43]Yeah, that's much better.
[14:34.72]This is what I want Skyrim to be, is this.
[14:39.66]What a fucking view.
[14:46.90]Turn RTX on.
[14:47.86]I don't even, I don't want to sprint.
[14:51.33]I feel like I'm going to have to play through this whole thing with whatever we do tonight, not sprinting.
[15:04.39]Can you turn arms on in the settings?
[15:07.69]Uh, there is an option to toggle, like, wrists, toggle hands, toggle shield.
[15:14.37]But I like it like this.
[15:16.63]Because it gives space to my character.
[15:20.05]You can turn off all these things, but I need them on.
[15:25.73]Yeah, you can toggle off the wrists.
[15:28.03]I like it.
[15:28.46]I like how it looks.
[15:29.24]It reminds me of, um, like I'm actually playing a first-person game.
[15:34.56]This is... I'm trying to parry.
[15:48.39]What?! !
[15:51.01]What's happening?
[15:52.61]Oh, I know what's happening.
[15:54.77]I know what's happening.
[15:56.13]Because... I need to be facing a very specific direction.
[16:06.00]Because if I try to parry a guy that's... Okay, so if I'm standing like this... The parry is gonna work this way, right?
[16:12.22]But if I take a look at an enemy over here... No, that's not gonna work.
[16:17.51]You have to be straight in front of somebody.
[16:20.53]Tweet that the stream is live?
[16:21.55]Oh fuck, hold on.
[16:24.07]Yeah, just look at fucking Anor Londo over there.
[16:36.96]Is rolling in first person vomit inducing?
[16:38.79]It is not.
[16:40.03]Because it does not move your head.
[16:41.81]The camera doesn't move.
[16:43.83]Let me just, like, tweet that.
[16:53.11]I'll be surprised if I can beat the first boss here.
[16:55.89]It's going to take me like an hour.
[16:57.71]But we're going to do it.
[16:58.35]Alright.
[17:11.63]Let's go.
[17:16.54]Now that looks ugly.
[17:19.90]That looks so cool, but the shield really is ruining it.
[17:31.26]Oh man.
[17:31.98]Oh, it is so hard to parry in first person.
[17:37.08]You just, it's like nothing you've ever seen before.
[17:46.79]No, I have to learn.
[17:47.61]I have to learn how to do it.
[17:54.10]I'm not even facing the right direction.
[18:11.69]Use a mouse?
[18:12.85]A mouse isn't gonna do... Oh my god, wait a minute, is it?
[18:16.62]No, I can't use the mouse, see?
[18:22.26]No, that's hell.
[18:23.40]That looks horrible.
[18:24.22]Alright, forget about parrying for now.
[18:33.90]Let's just move on.
[18:35.72]I'll learn it eventually.
[18:45.52]I love and hate this at the same time.
[18:47.46]I love this more than I hate this, though.
[18:49.06]So it's good.
[18:49.89]I like it.
[18:50.55]It's actually really fucking cool.
[18:51.63]Alright, remember this part.
[18:59.49]I gotta jump to this.
[19:03.30]Oh my goodness, I didn't make it.
[19:10.15]Yeah, get out of my way.
[19:16.33]Yeah, locking on doesn't do very much either.
[19:18.21]Because once you lock on, if you step in a certain direction, it doesn't lock on anymore.
[19:26.66]Let me go get that item.
[19:36.70]Beat the boss first try.
[19:40.10]I'm gonna go for it.
[19:41.48]I can't promise it's gonna happen, but I'm gonna try.
[19:47.90]Oh, goddammit.
[20:02.01]Attempt number three.
[20:04.25]To jump... To jump to item.
[20:11.76]Okay, got it.
[20:13.82]Get my first shot.
[20:16.96]Alright, let's go, Gundyr.
[20:21.98]I am prepared.
[20:23.77]But not really at all.
[20:39.17]It's scary like this.
[20:49.03]Have to be a role player?
[20:50.75]So I cast out the sword from your chest.
[20:55.67]Champion of Gundia.
[21:03.04]Oh my goodness gracious.
[21:07.38]Oh.
[21:21.84]This is mind blowing.
[21:37.75]This is insane.
[21:39.23]I don't even know where he is.
[21:46.03]If I get him to phase 2 I'll be happy.
[22:02.26]Oh, I just can't tell where I am!
[22:03.43]Maybe I should just bring it to you, though.
[22:13.64]Oh fuck, I forgot about this part.
[22:15.54]He turns into an alien!
[22:25.24]Oh, dead.
[22:32.55]That was a decent first attempt.
[22:35.63]Died to Gundyr.
[22:38.41]Yeah, I did.
[22:39.71]And I'm proud of it.
[22:40.77]Let me try the shield this time.
[22:45.73]That's how I was going to do it before.
[22:46.75]I'm going to try shield.
[22:48.31]Let's try blocking and dodging, because dodging is going to be very hard.
[22:59.88]I'm just going to hold my hand in the air like this.
[23:01.61]Alright, let's go.
[23:14.76]What's wrong with his body?
[23:17.18]Why does he have an extra limb?
[23:24.98]Oh my goodness.
[23:31.20]He gained a limb.
[23:44.03]Oh, I'm facing the wrong way.
[23:44.87]Okay.
[23:45.53]Now I am.
[24:03.34]Oh, not this shit.
[24:06.68]I...
[24:23.18]This is so scary!
[24:27.74]This is worse than a horror game, I swear to god!
[24:32.10]Jesus!
[24:37.59]Oh my god, this is worse than anything!
[24:46.55]Oh my god, this is too scary!
[24:56.01]Nice YouTuber reaction.
[25:08.64]I'll get it.
[25:08.98]I'll get it.
[25:09.30]I got it.
[25:09.58]I got it.
[25:09.92]I got it.
[25:10.60]I got it.
[25:10.84]This is the coolest mod ever.
[25:13.82]You know why?
[25:14.26]Because it doesn't matter how many times you've played this game.
[25:19.33]This is probably character number, like, 15 for me.
[25:23.47]It doesn't matter.
[25:23.91]It...
[25:28.19]Something ain't right here.
[25:30.35]Something ain't right.
[25:32.49]He's still like the puppet thing.
[25:49.32]Okay, I guess we're gonna deal with it.
[25:51.15]What happens when he turns on his puppet master thing?
[26:00.42]I can't even see him attack now.
[26:01.46]This is not good.
[26:16.07]The assets aren't resetting when he dies.
[26:19.19]Oh, that's not good.
[26:23.87]You almost have to go by audio cues for a lot of these things.
[26:28.81]Oh, there we go, I'm okay.
[26:47.76]Ah, shit.
[26:50.82]Ah!
[27:01.20]Oh, my God!
[27:02.08]Ah!
[27:32.43]Don't do it don't do it
[28:12.39]That's intense.
[28:14.53]I like this.
[28:26.53]Yeah, we gotta think about weapon.
[28:29.29]What the hell I want to use for a weapon?
[28:34.57]You're gonna hate it in an hour or so.
[28:36.53]Oh, I'm aware.
[28:37.47]This is gonna be fun for like an hour.
[28:50.54]Use a facecam.
[28:51.53]I can't put a facecam on.
[28:55.79]Dual-wield Ultra Greatswords or Riot.
[29:01.63]I need something.
[29:04.14]That's got good... I don't know.
[29:07.32]Reach?
[29:07.50]Alright.
[29:14.34]Can somebody count the YouTuber screams that I make over the course of the stream?
[29:30.80]Need depth.
[29:39.50]Homeward bone.
[29:43.78]Here comes the fall-off joke.
[29:45.20]No, no, no.
[29:46.00]That's gonna happen, but not right now.
[29:53.77]Facecam or ice cream?
[29:56.07]You're gonna have to eat ice cream.
[29:57.13]I'm sorry.
[30:01.79]Here's a fall-off joke for you.
[30:03.79]Everybody does this to this guy.
[30:04.91]See ya.
[30:05.05]Didn't that other... Should I just hook... Can I think... No, no way I'm gonna fight that guy up there.
[30:22.91]Get a katana.
[30:33.24]I can't go that way.
[30:35.88]Fight the katana guy?
[30:37.08]I have to parry the katana guy, and we've seen how disastrous that is.
[30:40.93]I need- let me- I gotta level up first.
[30:43.89]I almost just killed her.
[31:04.60]Everybody knows this.
[31:05.30]Alright, what the hell do I want to do?
[31:08.60]How am I going to play this?
[31:09.62]Just dump it into Endurance at first?
[31:15.83]Or should I just dump it into Vitality?
[31:30.46]Dex, yeah, dex is probably a good idea.
[31:32.64]Because I could use a bow, but doesn't bow go into first person anyways?
[31:48.11]Luck.
[31:50.73]There's no reason to do luck.
[31:52.76]Unless I want to get a specific scaling item or...
[32:01.05]Well, we definitely need... our endurance is terrible right now, so let me just get this out of the way.
[32:16.90]Okay.
[32:25.95]You really get to see the scale of how the game actually is.
[32:29.43]This hallway seems so far away.
[32:33.07]The blacksmith is so far away.
[32:35.51]When you play this game from the normal perspective, it's just like, oh, there he is!
[32:39.07]How you doing?
[32:40.85]This is a long walk.
[32:51.74]Alright, let me go try to embarrass myself at the katana guy.
[32:58.28]The shield is so annoying.
[32:59.88]I know, but the shield might become very necessary.
[33:03.30]As in, like, right now.
[33:08.07]No, he's... I can't do anything with him, right?
[33:11.97]No, I gotta get the soul thing from the tree.
[33:22.12]It really makes it feel like Dark Souls.
[33:38.09]Alright, let's go try to lose to the Katana guy.
[33:49.95]Just dump it into Endurance, and I'm gonna just do like a raw gem.
[33:53.71]Somebody mentioned that, that's a good idea.
[33:55.77]Alright, where is he?
[33:58.65]Come on.
[34:01.34]Parry, first try.
[34:02.60]One, two, three...
[34:18.69]I just, like, let him kill me.
[34:27.24]Alright.
[34:29.28]Alright.
[34:30.96]Back to it.
[34:34.68]Oh wait, that's right.
[34:36.00]I can't do it now.
[34:37.24]I locked myself out for a little while, didn't I?
[34:51.64]Come on, load.
[35:03.07]I'm gonna get this sword.
[35:04.74]Welcome to the next, probably, at least five minutes of the stream, because that's all it's gonna take me.
[35:21.10]Off the stairs, come on.
[35:38.45]I wasn't ready for that one!
[35:44.95]Oh shit!
[35:52.51]It's all off now.
[35:53.19]I don't even know where I am.
[35:54.71]I can't parry somebody on a staircase.
[36:02.70]Get these people out of the way!
[36:09.35]You dickhead!
[36:10.25]I'm gonna lose again!
[36:11.07]No!
[36:11.37]I just... It's the people on the stairs!
[36:23.18]This is like the bodies on the stairs in first person.
[36:25.50]It's so much worse.
[36:30.01]I would have had it too if I didn't.
[36:37.29]Because they take up so much more real estate on your screen when you're at this perspective.
[36:47.56]Get me in there.
[36:49.16]I'm doing it.
[36:52.41]He needs one hit, too.
[36:53.57]Fucking god.
[36:57.55]Increase the FOV?
[36:59.49]I don't know if it's possible.
[37:00.78]And if I do, I might throw up if I do.
[37:04.04]Because this is already at... I think this is already at something very high.
[37:07.84]Alright, just don't move.
[37:15.53]Just do what I just did.
[37:16.53]I just did it like four times in a row.
[37:20.11]I just panicked because he did a quick swing.
[37:28.99]What was wrong with that?
[37:34.01]He's still hitting me.
[37:43.19]I gotta heal.
[37:47.81]Oh, motherfucker.
[37:49.17]I didn't even know how close he was.
[37:50.71]I think I'm gonna... There's a wall behind me, I think.
[37:58.40]There's a wall, there's a wall behind me.
[38:00.82]Wait, hold on, I'll get him.
[38:09.20]Get the fuck out of my way!
[38:44.66]Oh, hold on.
[38:45.26]I don't think I've ever seen what that guy looks like.
[38:53.59]Alright, I'm gonna do this one more time.
[38:59.47]Last try.
[39:18.62]Last try, and this time, I'm gonna... I'm just gonna fight him.
[39:23.37]The old-fashioned way.
[39:29.30]Parries are weird.
[39:32.60]Let's go.
[39:49.73]Oh, never mind.
[39:50.83]That's too hard.
[39:51.51]I need to control this camera with right stick.
[40:00.38]Oh, no way.
[40:23.37]How is he still alive?
[40:24.05]Okay.
[40:36.36]Oh, okay.
[40:47.61]I'll exit the game.
[40:52.74]Modern problems require modern solution.
[41:02.82]Again, I get this rest of the bonfire, right?
[41:06.01]Did I miss any other items?
[41:10.59]I know there's like a dog down here, right?
[41:11.97]There's like a place to get... Yeah, right here.
[41:14.71]Is there an item?
[41:16.55]Oh, fuck it.
[41:16.99]Who cares?
[41:17.33]I've already played this game like a thousand times.
[41:29.78]So I... I... Wrestling at the bonfire will do the same thing, won't it?
[41:32.92]I actually need to, like, quit the game.
[41:44.51]Gotta reload.
[41:45.09]Okay.
[41:53.14]Bonfire, bonfire, bonfire.
[41:54.34]Chat, bonfire will work.
[42:15.24]Let's see.
[42:15.50]Yeah, it's right there.
[42:22.32]Alright, so do I put this on, is the question.
[42:37.36]Dark Souls 1 is where you have to reload, yeah.
[42:47.57]Alright, let's move on.
[42:49.61]I have enough to level up.
[42:50.39]I'm going to do Endurance again.
[42:51.33]Or maybe Vitality.
[42:53.01]What do I need here?
[43:00.96]Yeah.
[43:08.58]Alright, it's time to... Let me see what that looks like.
[43:14.57]I played with this.
[43:15.29]You need 16... 115... I can't even... I can't even two-handed or anything, right?
[43:23.96]Well, I can.
[43:29.02]No, it's... this is... I don't think... I got the Master's Armor, right?
[43:42.29]No, I don't want this shit on.
[43:43.33]I need the defense.
[43:50.00]Two-handed dex weapon.
[43:51.44]What?
[43:51.62]You two-hand the katana?
[43:52.54]What's wrong with that?
[43:53.16]Alright, I'm going.
[44:10.86]Lego Island confirmed.
[44:11.88]What do you mean, Lego Island confirmed?
[44:18.06]This is not a YouTuber... This is not a YouTuber setup.
[44:20.95]I mean, yes it is, probably.
[44:21.99]They always probably pick Knight, don't they?
[44:25.05]See, this is the part I'm interested in here.
[44:30.09]I want to see how this looks from first person.
[44:31.97]It's going to be so cool.
[44:32.95]Remember when you first looked at this?
[44:35.48]When you first played this game two years ago?
[44:49.57]That's so cool.
[44:55.02]Even the boxes look better.
[44:56.14]I don't want to rush through this.
[45:08.33]It's too interesting to just run by the bonfire and go.
[45:11.45]That's a pretty good E3 demo you're doing.
[45:22.58]E3 presentation camera.
[45:28.42]So?
[45:32.80]At the High Wall of Lothric, your character will start their journey.
[45:38.53]But be careful.
[45:39.55]Dragons and ghouls are amount.
[45:46.17]Each character in Dark Souls 3 is unique.
[45:50.31]Fuck.
[45:58.90]That happens in the presentation.
[46:05.73]Fired!
[46:10.69]Oh no!
[46:11.01]That guy!
[46:11.27]I gotta kill that guy!
[46:18.83]This is what the shield is for.
[46:19.81]I'm gonna have... I'm gonna shit my pants during this stream.
[46:35.31]I think this is the correct way to do it.
[46:36.65]I need a big shield and I'm going to be heavy.
[46:39.67]It's too scary to dodge around.
[46:43.51]No, let's go up here first.
[46:59.92]Oh god.
[47:17.60]The default enemies are even terrifying.
[47:26.48]Jesus.
[47:33.09]I don't even know.
[47:34.17]My back is against the wall.
[47:37.64]Oh, yaiyai.
[47:41.68]Oh, fuck.
[47:52.23]How the fuck, how far did I run?
[48:04.67]I gotta keep going.
[48:07.05]Just progression.
[48:07.81]Progress up to where that guy's throwing from.
[48:17.01]Chad, no.
[48:17.61]Chad, what's going on with Chad?
[48:37.64]What is this?
[48:39.16]Dermot turns his webcam on.
[48:41.18]Dermot turns it... Why is that going on right now?
[48:48.46]What does that have to do with anything?
[49:12.14]Longsword!
[49:18.07]This one's new, so it's better.
[49:27.72]Got the binoculars!
[49:37.57]I'm gonna get lost.
[49:40.72]I used to know this area like the back of my hand.
[49:42.98]Not anymore.
[49:46.27]Use them?
[49:47.47]Ah.
[49:51.57]Let's use them!
[49:53.11]What are we gonna look at?
[49:54.43]Up there?
[50:04.96]That's it.
[50:15.93]All I did was remove my shield and sword.
[50:24.31]The only thing I don't like about the visuals is the beige.
[50:28.31]I mean, it is a little dreary here, but... We're not supposed to be seeing it from this perspective.
[50:34.20]This is not allowed.
[50:35.10]We're supposed to be up above.
[50:40.20]Up, like, there, in a third-person perspective.
[50:45.99]It is very interesting to go through this all again, though.
[51:02.76]So, locking on... Let's check something.
[51:07.18]I wonder if locking on... Oh, my brain just can't do it from here.
[51:10.76]This is never gonna happen.
[51:19.27]It's just too awkward.
[51:23.27]I did it, like, perfectly fine, like, four times in a row, but... No, I ain't gonna have them reliably.
[51:28.56]Alright, now that I explored that area, I'm gonna go refill my life.
[51:55.71]2018 Jerma is better than 2019 Jerma?
[51:58.81]We've had like two weeks!
[51:59.91]That's such an unfair statement.
[52:06.22]You have a full year of streams that you can remember.
[52:10.28]It's been two weeks!
[52:13.69]Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna die.
[52:32.82]Okay, here we go.
[52:46.01]It's easier to be surrounded by enemies.
[52:52.45]I'll be lucky enough if I get to, uh, the big bulldog.
[52:56.09]Or his name is.
[52:57.14]Bulldog of the Boreal Valley.
[52:58.38]Okay.
[53:10.48]Bort?
[53:10.90]What's his name?
[53:13.56]This is what I waited for the whole time.
[53:15.70]This is what I wanted to see.
[53:16.36]Get out of the way, you're gonna ruin the fucking shot.
[53:19.42]Get out of my way.
[53:21.24]You're gonna ruin the shot!
[53:22.24]Get out of the way!
[53:25.92]You don't ruin the shot!
[53:27.04]Here it comes, here it comes.
[53:36.42]Where is it?
[53:36.74]Where's the dragon?
[53:43.98]I'm gonna go up.
[53:45.64]That's pretty cool.
[53:52.04]That's pretty cool.
[53:58.85]Oh.
[54:12.20]E3 scripted moment.
[54:13.36]Let's just level.
[54:15.82]Ow.
[54:26.03]Oh no, I forgot about these guys.
[54:31.33]Get those arrows out.
[54:32.41]Oh.
[54:38.32]How do I take the arrow out?
[54:40.22]It's just in my chest.
[54:42.59]I'm gonna lose to these guys.
[54:44.29]This is gonna be bad.
[55:15.61]Don't I get surrounded here?
[55:16.37]They like crawl on the- yeah, they crawl up, right?
[55:26.54]How did I miss every one of those?
[55:28.08]How is it possible?
[55:30.84]I swung in every single direction!
[55:34.74]And I don't know if- so we gotta go through here.
[55:36.32]I remember this part.
[55:41.73]Don't call me a game journalist.
[55:57.18]And who cares?
[56:08.95]I really should just retitle this stream, Dark Souls... Dark Souls 3, the E3 experience.
[56:14.27]That's not a bad idea.
[56:29.32]Oh, a bonfire!
[56:31.60]Good find.
[56:41.25]Open the mimic so we can see the first person.
[56:43.14]I'm not reading that.
[56:47.02]You have to find somebody else to read that one.
[56:48.48]It ain't gonna be me.
[56:59.30]It's funny, because when I first installed this, I thought, hey, this would be fun to do for a little bit.
[57:05.02]I actually did not think I would get to this point.
[57:09.80]So, we're going to beat Vordt of the Boreal Valley.
[57:15.40]We're going to beat that dog.
[57:17.70]I'm going to beat that boss.
[57:24.56]What's down here?
[57:25.14]I forget.
[57:29.54]Isn't there little jester guys down here too?
[57:35.96]There are.
[57:36.32]There he is.
[57:41.07]No.
[57:46.09]It's so cool that you can actually see where they're placing the enemies.
[57:49.05]It makes it harder, but it also makes it easier in some rooms.
[58:01.18]That's Undead Settlement, yeah.
[58:03.06]Wrong place.
[58:13.60]Why do I hear noises?
[58:14.37]Kind of want to try this with a bow?
[58:22.87]That would be interesting, but when you go to bow, you go to first person anyways, don't you?
[58:28.97]Although, I guess it would be... Maybe we should just see what it looks like.
[58:37.21]How bad do these people smell?
[58:41.81]Oh, I get it.
[58:42.47]Okay.
[58:43.10]For a second, I'm like, what are you talking about?
[58:48.14]I remember this part.
[58:49.28]Okay.
[58:51.34]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[58:54.74]I gotta kill the guy right in the middle.
[58:59.62]Go, get him.
[59:01.88]Which one is it?
[59:02.32]Which one is he?
[59:02.85]This one right here.
[59:09.74]I didn't do it fast enough.
[59:36.51]No, no, no way.
[59:37.81]No way.
[59:38.55]Not gonna happen.
[59:39.13]No way.
[59:41.33]No way.
[59:42.27]Where's... I'm out.
[59:44.46]Okay, there's a wall.
[59:52.92]Go, go, go, go, go.
[59:59.23]I didn't do it fast enough.
[60:00.58]Shit.
[60:02.19]Oh well.
[60:29.09]Does he come over here?
[60:31.89]This is not a coward move, okay?
[60:35.07]This is intelligence at its finest.
[60:37.31]I ain't gonna fight that guy like that.
[60:52.56]Those guys attack every quarter of a second.
[60:56.38]I would get eaten alive.
[61:01.91]Wait, I can hear it.
[61:04.49]Is it weird that my other senses are better in first person?
[61:07.63]I can hear that cookie bug from a while away here.
[61:11.33]I can hear better?
[61:13.89]It's making my other senses.
[61:19.37]Told you.
[61:19.87]Look, cookie bug.
[61:20.81]There's the raw gem.
[61:32.18]That's all I need.
[61:42.27]That's so cool.
[61:44.21]I am gonna stop and look at all that.
[61:45.59]Every time.
[61:45.95]You know how sometimes you ask yourself when you fall from a height in Dark Souls?
[61:57.80]I wasn't even that far!
[62:00.29]I could survive that.
[62:01.07]No, you couldn't.
[62:02.91]Looking at this now from this perspective, no way.
[62:04.73]You're dead instantly.
[62:08.87]Now, I... I need to get this shortcut, which is down here.
[62:13.05]There's also... Oh, shit.
[62:21.76]Didn't they have the spear in there?
[62:26.04]Forget about items and shit.
[62:27.08]I need to just get a shortcut.
[62:35.25]Yeah, they come from behind too, don't they?
[63:00.85]Powered journalist.
[63:04.36]Is this a new character that we're making up here?
[63:06.48]That you guys are making up?
[63:29.97]Okay.
[63:32.36]I think it might be time for a weapon switch because there's a chance that this guy drops the halberd, right?
[63:42.23]Or do I just run by this guy and say fuck it and don't even try?
[64:07.73]It's down here, right?
[64:08.47]There's a weapon here.
[64:09.17]What is it?
[64:09.69]Oh.
[64:11.27]Oh my god.
[64:12.74]Does he see me?
[64:13.58]Will he see me if I sit here?
[64:20.72]What the fuck was that noise?
[64:23.48]What?
[64:47.11]Ah, it was just a scripted event.
[64:52.00]Anything else I can... I don't think I should fight this guy right now.
[64:54.16]He's gonna kick the shit out of me.
[65:04.91]Just parry him.
[65:06.75]That's way easier said than done.
[65:08.25]An Ember.
[65:14.32]Anything else?
[65:17.63]Yeah, I'm getting the shortcut.
[65:19.77]No way in hell am I going to get my ass kicked right here.
[65:22.17]I have to get the shortcut first.
[65:24.81]If I would have died there, I would have been very sad.
[65:33.45]Yeah, I got the weapon.
[65:36.27]But I... Honestly, this is just horror Skyrim.
[65:47.81]This is just, this is Skyrim with consequences.
[65:59.04]Okay, we're good.
[66:28.98]Journalist nearly has a heart attack playing new souls game I'm you get swarmed here Get on the elevator
[66:59.63]Oh, these near-death elevator moments are gonna be fucking scary.
[67:10.28]Here it is.
[67:10.70]Alright, we're good.
[67:22.08]Oh shit, I'm out of stamina.
[67:25.92]What?
[67:26.94]How did you do that?
[67:30.15]What's happening to me?
[67:33.91]That's the guy behind, right?
[67:43.28]Ugh.
[67:47.10]Roll into a backstab.
[68:03.81]I'm freaking out.
[68:04.77]I'm panicking.
[68:15.06]Do I live next to an airport?
[68:26.94]Alright.
[68:27.54]We did it.
[68:28.43]We got the shortcut.
[68:30.03]Now we just have to kill the boss.
[68:49.15]Alright, second level up.
[68:50.57]This is decision time, though.
[68:52.37]This really matters.
[68:54.95]Choices.
[68:55.35]My choices actually matter right now.
[68:58.62]For real.
[68:59.98]Because I don't know what's going to be more effective in first person.
[69:06.52]Long reach.
[69:07.54]Heavy.
[69:09.06]Quick.
[69:09.92]And able to move.
[69:10.56]A spear.
[69:14.98]A spear would work.
[69:17.92]Use the broken sword.
[69:19.22]That would be so stupid.
[69:32.89]I would also probably, I would say spear as well.
[69:40.21]Why would I use the broken... This is not one of those challenge games.
[69:43.93]Where I need to use no weapons or not get hit or something.
[69:47.41]Those... Respect to the people that do that and play that.
[69:52.27]It can do that.. I ain't gonna two-handed broken sword this game.
[70:05.48]No, what am I doing?
[70:06.08]I have to level up.
[70:07.10]I don't know what to do.
[70:08.04]There's so many options.
[70:12.38]I mean, I could just raw gem a longsword.
[70:14.68]Let me just open the... Let's break these all.
[70:33.37]Maybe I will try just, in quotes, spear him.
[70:41.89]Hold on.
[70:43.85]Longsword with a raw gem is 136.
[70:46.59]It's really not that big of a deal.
[70:51.78]You don't have a spear, do you?
[71:07.69]I mean, that's a halberd, but that's not necessarily a spear.
[71:11.02]I mean, it is.
[71:12.64]1500, I need 16 strength.
[71:25.12]The halberd is dogshit.
[71:34.30]Alright.
[71:35.70]It really, I know, but I need the reach.
[71:43.35]I'm gonna use the halberd.
[71:50.15]We're gonna think outside the fucking box.
[71:54.39]But first.
[71:54.91]Manifestations of disparity.
[72:02.58]Two-handing a longsword has the reach that you need.
[72:04.34]We're probably going to have to do strength.
[72:11.00]What is a spear?
[72:11.72]A spear's dex are strength.
[72:12.82]They're like a combination of both, aren't they are?
[72:14.34]Isn't it most of the spears in the game have a base dexterity you need of at least like 15 to 20?
[72:18.56]So then I should probably be putting points in a dexterity.
[72:29.77]Why is she just talking in the background?
[72:31.11]I know, I don't understand.
[72:39.08]Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm going for spears.
[72:41.94]So we're gonna do dex.
[72:46.30]I don't want to do a halberd.
[72:52.50]You also talk in the background.
[72:54.32]Yeah, that's true.
[72:54.90]I do.
[72:59.09]She... she can't tell that I left.
[73:05.69]The Firekeeper is streaming right now.
[73:07.93]Yeah.
[73:09.45]She's streaming just chatting.
[73:10.73]Alright, I'm going for it.
[73:17.72]14 decks.
[73:18.54]I need at least, like, 20.
[73:19.32]Or, like, 18 for a lot of the Spears.
[73:35.26]+2 reading off chat.
[73:43.60]I guess I could probably do it a couple more times.
[73:50.08]Just break them all.
[74:00.47]Just give me one more point, right?
[74:03.27]Put it into, like, Endurance.
[74:04.80]Um... Yeah, put it in Health.
[74:12.04]Okay.
[74:12.22]And... No.
[74:13.44]Let's just try to kill the boss.
[74:35.51]This is Jeremy's first time playing Dark Souls, so don't forget to type in all your helpful tips.
[74:41.97]How's this wrong?
[74:52.20]Up the FOV.
[74:54.60]I can't.
[74:56.80]We're currently at over 100, I believe.
[74:58.72]Let me just see exactly what FOV we are right now.
[75:10.75]FOV is at... I don't know if I can change it.
[75:25.01]No, I'm not sure I can change this.
[75:29.78]It might crash the game if I try to change it.
[75:37.89]Yeah, because if the FOV is changed any more than it is now, you'll probably be able to see.
[75:43.90]Yeah, behind me.
[75:45.26]It'll fuck up the whole thing.
[75:49.30]Alright, let's go.
[75:50.90]So, I got the shortcut.
[75:52.42]I have to go down from here, right?
[75:54.94]I'm so fucking... I am so... ...disodorante, you know what I mean?
[76:13.84]There, here it is.
[76:17.92]That's so scary.
[76:28.05]No, I don't... What's going on?
[76:37.71]Oh my fucking god.
[76:45.87]Why is this on?
[77:18.26]110, 22, I mean... Let's put it on.
[77:26.18]What the fuck did I just do?
[77:32.45]What's going on?
[77:34.79]Okay.
[77:41.76]There we go.
[77:44.02]Now we just got good.
[77:47.35]Now we got real good!
[77:49.51]I can poke from behind the shield.
[78:07.34]I love it.
[78:08.33]It's perfect.
[78:15.53]Don't get overzealous with this, though.
[78:20.70]I've already used two flasks.
[78:24.97]Alright, now let's fight the dragon.
[78:26.63]And by dragon, I mean the dragon rider.
[78:28.59]The Dragonslayer.
[78:29.59]This guy.
[78:29.93]I'm ready.
[78:43.17]Okay.
[79:00.13]I don't even know what fucking mode I'm in right now.
[79:02.21]Am I in... I blame that on the broken sword bullshit.
[79:30.12]Pro tip, don't panic and run past the spinning death axe.
[79:34.94]Yeah, well, it's easier said than done when... That's easier said than done.
[79:42.89]Oh, it's not up here.
[79:48.03]Oh!
[79:55.67]No!
[79:57.93]No!
[79:58.73]I have to do this.
[80:05.16]Where is he?
[80:05.48]Okay, he's dead.
[80:31.79]I don't know if they're behind me or not.
[80:38.26]Wait, there's a... There's a weapon.
[80:41.19]Over here.
[80:44.54]There's a spear over here.
[81:04.25]There's a spear somewhere over here.
[81:05.61]Let me get it.
[81:20.16]Because that would help.
[81:25.56]I'm gonna have to just run, get the item, and then run to the boss.
[81:35.74]It's up there, right?
[81:44.61]The High Tower of Lothric.
[81:47.35]There it is.
[81:54.93]I'm trapped.
[81:56.59]I'm trapped.
[81:56.93]I gotta run.
[81:58.41]How much is it to wear this?
[82:01.29]I need 15 strength.
[82:14.58]I can two-hand it, but I lose the shield.
[82:16.92]Let's take a look.
[82:17.62]Hold on.
[82:27.46]This just looks like Grandpa's cane.
[82:38.78]I'm gonna give it a try.
[82:42.00]How many times can I spin?
[82:55.43]I need to take the shield off.
[82:56.75]Because it's going to get in the way.
[82:59.31]Alright, here we go.
[83:10.22]What's Cousin It?
[83:10.92]No, what's the... The hand.
[83:14.54]What's the hand from Adam's family?
[83:20.19]The thing.
[83:21.25]No, not the thing.
[83:22.33]Is it the... No, it's not Master Hand.
[83:26.62]Mr. Hands.
[83:27.38]No.
[83:28.78]Cousin Hands.
[83:32.94]See if I can first strike.
[83:34.04]This is the first real test.
[83:45.23]This is incredibly menacing.
[83:46.47]Can I do it?
[83:50.91]He's getting closer.
[83:52.15]He's getting closer.
[83:52.81]Hold on.
[83:53.57]I gotta...
[84:04.05]Whoa!
[84:04.37]I forgot, okay, no, he does like a dash, right?
[84:06.61]Yeah, he does the dash.
[84:09.15]What just happened?
[84:43.33]I need to heal.
[84:50.03]Oh shit.
[84:50.77]Bad, bad, bad, very bad.
[84:53.11]He was right in front of me.
[85:05.30]Oh, I'm stuck inside of his body!
[85:08.56]Where is he?
[85:26.51]Oh, no, no, no, this is where he dashes.
[85:36.80]He breathes ice!
[85:37.74]He breathes... Run!
[85:38.71]I have to go to the left side, but I didn't have...
[85:57.03]wild.
[85:58.29]This is absolutely wild.
[86:10.83]Oh.
[86:36.20]Oh shit, what have I done?
[87:06.52]I'm so scared.
[87:13.68]Itchy nose.
[87:14.62]Itchy fucking nose right now.
[87:16.00]Itchy nose!
[87:17.06]I have to itch it!
[87:29.73]Die die die die die die die!
[87:30.79]Got it.
[87:31.43]Oh!
[87:31.83]Itchy.
[87:32.67]Thank god.
[87:46.04]That was bad.
[87:46.72]It got really, really itchy.
[87:51.82]That was like fighting him for the first time again.
[87:53.76]Although I obviously remember the moves he does, but... Oh, we had a raid, couldn't we?
[88:13.05]Raid?
[88:13.39]I don't see who it was.
[88:22.47]Now fight the dancer.
[88:27.59]This is so cool.
[88:33.50]Oh, it was a joke raid.
[88:34.92]It wasn't a real raid.
[88:36.18]It was a joke raid.
[88:38.08]I gotta get the banner.
[88:43.11]No, it was real.
[88:44.21]Who raided?
[88:44.61]Why are you guys telling me it wasn't real?
[88:51.70]Oh, everyone's saying it was not real.
[88:58.10]From Katie.
[89:01.30]Well, thank you, Katie.
[89:03.46]Welcome, everybody.
[89:04.24]I thought it was fake.
[89:05.28]Everyone told me that it was fake.
[89:06.36]I'm sorry to call you fake.
[89:09.83]We've had fake raids before.
[89:10.99]There are characters in this universe.
[89:18.95]But thank you so much.
[89:20.21]Welcome, everybody.
[89:23.53]Hopefully you had a good stream.
[89:29.89]Really appreciate it, thank you.
[89:31.31]Welcome to Dark Souls First Person.
[89:32.98]It's a fun, it's a pretty fun fucking game.
[89:41.08]That was a pretty good YouTuber intro.
[89:43.80]God, you gotta welcome the new viewers, man.
[89:46.04]Hey, what's going on guys?
[89:46.88]Welcome to the stream.
[89:49.46]Just had a WTF moment there.
[89:52.83]I beat Bort first try!
[89:54.47]Yeah.
[90:00.78]I'm leaving.
[90:01.50]Oh.
[90:03.02]Goddammit, I'm sorry.
[90:03.70]Do you think I can fight the, uh, the legendary holy man over there?
[90:18.90]Can't do two- I cannot do two.
[90:20.24]I can do one.
[90:22.70]Definitely not two at a time.
[90:28.41]Trying to get a backstab.
[90:36.68]Sometimes you gotta run.
[90:37.68]And that's right now.
[90:38.24]I just want to get the item.
[90:41.74]I can do a GTA rear view mirror.
[90:52.09]Oh, fuck off.
[90:58.43]Quick, say something funny before they leave.
[91:02.25]I don't- I don't got anything funny.
[91:19.60]I have nothing funny to say right now.
[91:24.30]I don't know.
[91:25.04]What's something funny that I could say to keep them here?
[91:28.21]Kill her.
[91:30.45]Why would I do that?
[91:30.97]That's not funny.
[91:31.77]That just ruins the game.
[91:34.93]That ruins the video game.
[91:35.97]I'm not going to ruin the video game.
[91:38.41]I got the item and I'm going to... What's up here?
[91:42.02]He's guarding an item, right?
[91:43.76]No, he's not.
[91:44.18]He's just hard.
[92:07.77]Okay.
[92:09.75]We're in desperate need of an LUL moment.
[92:13.19]Well, you're not getting any LUL moments because the streamer's doing pretty good in the first person LOL.
[92:20.54]No way he's going to be able to beat anything in first person LOL stream.
[92:24.04]I'm doing pretty good.
[92:26.00]Considering.
[92:36.33]Hey, uh, wave, uh, bye-bye.
[92:40.25]Fuckin' idiot, fuckin' idiot, fuckin' idiot.
[92:44.19]Hey guys, put your head up, wave, bye-bye.
[92:59.68]Why is that a trunk impression?
[93:01.06]What are you talking about?
[93:17.50]Get the fuck away from me, holy shit!
[93:20.78]Get away from me!
[93:35.21]They're still alive!
[93:39.30]No, don't die here.
[93:40.50]Don't die.
[93:40.88]I'm right next to the fucking bonfire.
[93:51.51]Ugh.
[93:59.11]Give me a break.
[94:00.15]Just travel there.
[94:03.45]I forgot.
[94:03.87]I played too much Dark Souls 1.
[94:05.39]I can actually just teleport to it.
[94:15.27]Does the targeting, no.
[94:16.43]Targeting works, but it kind of breaks.
[94:22.28]Targeting only works if they're in like a... pretty much like a 60 degree cone in front of you.
[94:29.24]Because it doesn't turn the camera to face the person.
[94:32.18]So if they're in this kind of area, I'll give you an example here.
[94:36.69]So, this is point A, this is point B, chair's point B. If they're in this, that cone,
[94:44.39]Right?
[94:45.21]That's a foul ball over there.
[94:47.73]If I move this way, yeah, sure.
[94:49.77]If I move this way, yeah, sure.
[94:51.78]But if I go like this, the camera does not keep turning.
[95:07.27]What does Frost Dog have for a boss weapon?
[95:10.15]It's like an ice sword, right?
[95:13.19]And the thing's a piece of fucking shit.
[95:15.01]So I ain't gonna use it.
[95:18.32]I don't get the joke.
[95:19.26]That wasn't a joke.
[95:20.14]I was telling you how it is with targeting.
[95:28.49]I didn't get it until you put it into baseball terms.
[95:30.53]See?
[95:33.69]The ice mace is good.
[95:39.67]Yeah, but we're going Spear.
[95:42.42]Alright, what do I have?
[95:48.18]Get Endurance to 15.
[95:49.18]I don't have to worry about it.
[95:50.77]Okay.
[95:51.49]Should I upgrade?
[95:57.37]I'm gonna just upgrade this thing.
[96:06.91]So a 3 would be good, because you can... Spacing doesn't matter, depth doesn't matter.
[96:11.29]Yeah, that's true.
[96:16.13]Should I get this to... I mean, Titanite shards are a dime a dozen, so I'm just going to upgrade it once.
[96:27.80]Or... 156?
[96:40.16]156 versus... what would it be?
[96:48.28]38.
[96:48.30]48.
[96:48.50]Meh.
[96:50.02]No, it's not worth it.
[96:52.55]Just get an actual spear.
[96:54.47]I'm not gonna kill anybody.
[97:02.73]I'm not killing any NPCs.
[97:05.34]Let's do longsword quality build.
[97:11.41]Yeah, I wanna stab, though.
[97:13.19]Alright, so we're gonna go back to there and just put the banner down.
[97:28.50]There are other mods that I have, but... I kinda like this.
[97:32.58]This is fun.
[97:38.04]Should we try another one?
[97:51.88]The invisible van.
[97:56.14]He's naked.
[97:57.58]All he has is two gloves on.
[97:58.66]Yeah, I have, uh, some other ones.
[98:04.70]Okay, here's the thing, though.
[98:05.86]If I turn on the other ones, it will actually ruin the entire game.
[98:12.27]Now, I'm gonna get my fill of first-person mod before I turn on the randomize the speed of the game mod.
[98:18.29]Do you understand?
[98:32.00]No, I can't... Look!
[98:33.41]Do you see how beautiful this is?
[98:40.67]Do them both at the same time.
[98:42.11]I... I wouldn't get anything done.
[99:01.79]Wait a second.
[99:22.19]Hey, what's going on guys?
[99:23.29]No, this is just a reaction to the reaction.
[99:34.05]That was just a reaction.
[99:36.27]Hold on.
[99:49.84]Is there a voiceover on this one?
[99:53.16]One is that we've incorporated kind of things that are going on around you in the community into the world map itself.
[99:59.56]So it's a really natural-
[100:02.94]Okay, let's go.
[100:06.00]Um, when you and I were talking a little bit earlier you were talking about ways that a player who maybe doesn't have a big pool of friends online or- or isn't super social when it comes to online gaming how they can connect with other players in the world in Anthem.
[100:18.00]Can you talk a little bit about how me when I jump into Anthem, when it comes out, how I'm gonna find other players and how the game is gonna alert me that other things are happening?
[100:26.93]Sure, I love that.
[100:28.39]So we realized that sometimes multiplayer experiences can be a little bit awkward or it might be kind of difficult to find friends to play with.
[100:40.50]So we've done a couple of things to try to ease that experience.
[100:43.72]One is that we've incorporated kind of things that are going on around you in the community
[100:51.02]This one's gonna be good, I promise.
[101:21.87]This is going to be good.
[101:29.18]Here we go.
[101:30.64]This is great.
[101:31.88]I got my own little TV.
[101:33.58]This is perfect.
[101:35.95]Adam's doing a fantastic job so far.
[101:37.85]It's been really good.
[101:38.77]First of all, you're actually playing this right now.
[101:42.03]I do want to emphasize how beautiful this game is.
[101:45.97]Thank you.
[101:46.97]Brian, tell me a little bit about what you guys want to show us this evening.
[101:50.06]so I think I mean the big thing is again you know I think that part of the spider the Spider-Man fantasy is to swing around New York city and you know to have you know not only just a great story but have a bunch of different activities in that world and we wanted to you know give people who attend e3 an opportunity to experience that so you know obviously we it's a big narrative driven experience but same time part of that superhero fantasy especially that Spider-Man experience is
[102:15.91]living, uh, within New York City and seeing that, so, um, you know, Adam is one of, uh, he's one of our combat pro players, uh, because he's a combat designer, and, uh... That one wasn't very good.
[102:30.04]I was gonna try to do it like I'm swinging around.
[102:37.79]I didn't use the web.
[102:38.59]I didn't activate the web.
[102:49.44]2,000 IQ joke.
[102:55.90]That wasn't supposed to be a fall joke.
[102:57.46]Alright, I just get to the bonfire.
[102:58.75]What am I doing?
[103:05.41]I don't want to ruin... I didn't ruin the game yet.
[103:07.49]I just... I didn't turn any mods off.
[103:15.58]Okay.
[103:19.54]Oh, I can't touch the boss.
[103:23.70]Let's keep going.
[103:30.00]Can we just play Dark Souls 3?
[103:31.62]I mean, that's kind of what I'm doing right now.
[103:35.42]Just in a different perspective.
[103:46.78]I actually like this weapon.
[103:49.54]I do enjoy this weapon.
[103:55.43]A shield is gonna be so desperate here, though, because there's random enemies around corners.
[103:59.97]I'm gonna get fucking destroyed.
[104:01.19]Oh, there's the parry shield.
[104:08.24]Well, not really, but one of them.
[104:15.04]Oh, this is gonna be hell.
[104:16.08]This room is gonna be hell.
[104:27.74]That's so cool.
[104:29.90]Cut this guy down.
[104:33.25]Alright.
[104:46.04]Is this VR?
[104:48.22]That would be insane if this was VR.
[104:52.77]VR would make this game absolutely horrifying.
[104:56.43]And speaking of horrifying, I knew you were gonna show up.
[105:03.29]And we've made it into E-mode only mode.
[105:05.32]What happened?
[105:05.68]Was chat misbehaving?
[105:09.06]Were they misbehaving?
[105:10.04]Oh, fuck.
[105:21.73]I can see them, though.
[105:22.83]So this is fine.
[105:27.32]You can't sneak up on me.
[105:30.10]You little shit.
[105:34.05]Some of these come alive, don't they?
[105:56.55]What happened?
[105:58.39]Why is chat in timeout right now?
[106:07.54]Don't ask me why I did this.
[106:09.88]I guess it's free souls.
[106:18.96]You know what?
[106:20.86]I think I might get a glass of wine.
[106:23.58]This is a wine night?
[106:25.06]Is it possible?
[106:39.36]Oh shit, this is... Don't look at it, just dodge it.
[106:51.73]Oh my god, it just went through, it went through his body!
[106:54.87]It went through his body.
[106:56.43]I couldn't see it.
[106:57.45]First person!
[107:00.29]That's five community subs from Kazzy.
[107:01.85]Thank you, Kazzy.
[107:10.97]Thank you so much, Kazzy.
[107:12.99]Five community subs.
[107:15.40]You rock, thank you.
[107:17.46]Congratulations to those in the community that can now do the Jermaboomarimo!
[107:22.25]And you know, when you use that emote, anytime Jerma says something when he sounds old... Make sure you put that in the chat so everyone knows what you're talking about.
[107:36.08]If Jerma starts talking about the Super Nintendo, make sure you put that emote in the chat.
[107:41.74]Did Jerma reference an old Nickelodeon cartoon?
[107:44.14]Make sure you put that in the chat too.
[107:45.38]Alright.
[107:51.20]I'm just spamming right now.
[107:53.88]Uh, rflsa, thanks for the five community subs.
[107:55.98]Right back to back there, thank you.
[107:58.44]What?!
[107:59.36]I don't... Where am I?
[108:13.26]I was on the ground still.
[108:22.08]Don't roll off the edge.
[108:22.86]What do I got for real estate?
[108:24.54]Not much.
[108:30.06]Oh my god.
[108:30.86]I did not... Look at the wall.
[108:46.64]Holy... I buried it right in her head.
[108:58.96]Let her hug you.
[109:00.12]Why would I do that?
[109:00.84]Let's just use so many Estus flasks for that.
[109:05.18]God damn it.
[109:05.80]I need to go back.
[109:06.50]I'm just gonna run by this.
[109:07.50]Isn't there a shard over here somewhere?
[109:10.42]I know there's an Estus Shard somewhere in this area.
[109:16.14]Yeah, it's right there.
[109:18.48]Alright, let me go upgrade.
[109:36.69]Stupid floating hand.
[109:42.05]Do a pure faith build.
[109:45.81]I'm not sure that would be a good idea.
[109:59.10]Make sure to hydrate.
[109:59.82]Yeah, yeah, I could get some, uh... Water or wine?
[110:04.66]Which one?
[110:07.33]water or wine that's a good question both I could do both okay five why would I kill him
[110:35.29]Alright, let's... Do I have enough?
[110:37.87]I could just crush the... Yeah, I'm not going to use this.
[110:42.29]I mean, it's neat, but I'm not going to use it.
[110:48.39]Alright, 15-15.
[110:51.93]Looking at one in the decks.
[110:55.21]Oh yeah.
[111:04.17]Are there any cheaters in here?
[111:05.61]I mean, bits got deleted.
[111:11.47]What do you mean?
[111:22.89]Alright, I'm good.
[111:29.90]Hey, you know what?
[111:30.30]I'm just gonna upgrade this once.
[111:34.84]What do you think?
[111:35.36]I'm going to save the raw gem.
[111:36.48]I'm just going to put... Like a... I'm going to do... Who cares?
[111:41.24]I do.
[112:01.44]Alright.
[112:02.40]Who's the boss?
[112:02.96]There's two bosses here.
[112:03.98]There's the tree.
[112:04.56]The tree's going to be interesting in first person.
[112:08.88]Hey, Jerma, can you say, yeah, I'm trying to prove something?
[112:11.01]Sure.
[112:15.31]Is that good enough?
[112:29.02]I can't just sprint through.
[112:30.70]It's not gonna happen.
[112:36.81]Oh my god, he did it.
[112:37.63]Alright, there's a nest- there's a shard in the first area, too.
[112:43.55]It's in, like, the soup pit.
[112:47.65]Let's just keep going.
[112:54.65]He just died.
[112:56.65]He just fell down and died.
[112:59.37]Who?
[112:59.85]Who is it?
[113:02.91]Who is it?!
[113:03.35]Oh, this guy underneath me!
[113:06.48]What the fuck?
[113:13.96]Let's go down.
[113:21.45]Alright.
[113:22.05]Now it's time to slow it down and progress.
[113:31.34]God!
[113:32.30]Oh, there's people everywhere.
[113:33.38]Behind me too, I think.
[113:35.38]Don't roll off the cliff.
[113:42.36]Everyone's going to laugh at you.
[113:49.03]Oh!
[113:49.61]Did somebody just give 20?
[113:53.35]Skully P.
[113:55.91]20 community subs.
[113:57.25]Thank you so much, Skully.
[113:59.79]That's a shitload of money.
[114:02.61]20 community subs.
[114:05.84]I just got double hit.
[114:17.34]I'm a sub now.
[114:18.22]A lot of you are subs now.
[114:23.67]That's 20.
[114:23.99]There's the mummies down here, right?
[114:34.66]And the... The weird, like, person tentacle thing is here.
[114:37.74]Alright, hold on.
[114:39.12]I gotta back it up.
[114:40.82]Isn't there an NPC?
[114:49.89]New subs.
[114:50.53]Try... Oh, this is gonna be absolutely fucking awful.
[114:54.76]This guy's hard.
[115:18.81]Just increases the fear factor of this game.
[115:23.15]By, like, at least three or four Joe Rogans.
[115:24.98]Yeah, I know the trick.
[115:38.36]Alright.
[115:47.58]Charcoal pine rod.
[115:48.40]Can you even put that on?
[115:51.24]That has to go on a blade, right?
[115:58.41]Warrior of Sunlight.
[115:59.57]Praise the sun.
[116:00.47]Drink the Estes soup.
[116:01.59]Sure.
[116:05.45]Even more community subs coming in.
[116:08.13]From Seabear.
[116:11.24]Five community subs from Seabear.
[116:12.96]Thank you.
[116:13.28]You guys are just showering me with money.
[116:24.24]Sometimes I just don't know what to say, so thank you.
[116:33.58]This is a legit horror game.
[116:34.68]Yeah.
[116:36.06]It changes the whole landscape.
[116:39.11]Every corner is dangerous.
[116:42.57]Everything is scary.
[116:47.13]What does the +2 and -2 mean?
[116:50.07]Well, a while ago, like maybe a year ago, a buddy of mine, Etalyx, and I, we did a thing where...
[117:00.33]We played a game.
[117:01.01]We had to beat the game in one sitting, and we had four hours to beat the whole game.
[117:04.85]It was Kane and Lynch 2.
[117:07.43]So, the stipulation with that was every time we made a really, really good joke, we got to add time.
[117:13.71]And every time we made a really bad joke, we had time reduced from the time.
[117:24.38]Long story short...
[117:27.42]We did it.
[117:27.80]I don't want to spoil it, because if you haven't seen it, it was a fun stream.
[117:34.98]That's great.
[117:35.44]Yeah, nudity added, like, what?
[117:37.32]Subtracted an hour or two?
[117:49.92]So, what do you guys think the wall will be here?
[117:52.52]Where first person Dark Souls becomes pretty much not completed.
[117:55.44]What do you think?
[117:57.76]What boss am I about to find?
[118:02.22]I am the wall.
[118:07.76]There's no way I will get to Pontiff, but I would think Pontiff would probably be pretty close.
[118:12.49]Unless I can parry every move.
[118:14.85]I'm gonna...
[118:27.85]This is a challenge, though.
[118:30.29]I highly recommend if you are bored with Dark Souls or Dark Souls 3.
[118:36.33]I highly recommend you give this a look, because this is great.
[118:50.00]Where is he?
[118:50.64]There's two of them.
[118:52.72]Oh, shit.
[118:54.36]Oh, this is bad news.
[119:00.95]I only have one flask.
[119:11.44]I have to see what that looks like in first person.
[119:14.48]Is this a whip playthrough?
[119:29.05]It just looks like... You don't even look like you're using a whip.
[119:47.40]No, put it away.
[119:48.04]I'm so close to just being able to get through this.
[119:51.23]Just give me my... Give me my... Lucerne.
[119:58.15]Whip and then dab on them.
[119:59.21]But we don't dab on this gym.
[120:12.96]Oh, she comes down.
[120:18.04]I forgot.
[120:24.17]Oh, you mother!
[120:26.03]Bye-bye!
[120:30.46]We're close.
[120:30.90]We're very close.
[120:32.30]To just getting the... I am so scared right now.
[120:42.16]I hear a cookie bug.
[120:47.68]Where's the cookie bug?
[120:49.72]Yeah, the bonfire is right here.
[120:50.93]Oop.
[121:07.41]Sit down.
[121:08.25]Sit down.
[121:08.91]SIT DOWN!
[121:22.88]So, this is, uh... It feels like I'm playing chivalry.
[121:29.11]I can see that.
[121:31.91]The weapons seem to have the same weight.
[121:34.35]Same movement.
[121:34.99]That's a really good observation.
[121:36.11]Alright.
[121:50.09]Progression.
[121:53.01]Although, there are some things that I don't want to miss.
[121:56.63]But, I'm doing just fine.
[122:07.73]I've since gotten kind of used to the controls though.
[122:13.70]Knowing when to... because if you stay locked on, I still have to tilt right stick to move the camera.
[122:20.10]But it's not as bad as it was before.
[122:26.80]Say that now and I'm about to leave.
[122:34.67]No, we're not doing any more ki- I'm not even gonna say it.
[122:37.29]I'm not even gonna say it.
[122:42.35]Did I break up the wine yet?
[122:43.39]I have not.
[122:44.63]Not yet.
[122:49.47]Somebody tell my roommate to stop snoring.
[122:51.37]Put me on speaker.
[123:00.14]Hey.
[123:01.18]Hey.
[123:01.40]Hey, wake up for a second.
[123:03.04]Wake up for one second.
[123:05.55]I mean, I don't want to be rude, and I don't mean this in a mean way, but you're snoring, and, I mean, it's hard for me to study.
[123:15.19]I'm getting, I got a very, very, I got a tough paper due tomorrow, and I've got a math exam also tomorrow as well.
[123:21.35]So please, if, like, you could, maybe go get a glass of water.
[123:25.43]Like, thanks.
[123:26.59]Thank you, man.
[123:27.37]Really appreciate that.
[123:28.17]Like, thanks.
[123:28.99]I mean absolutely no disrespect or rudeness when I say this.
[123:33.20]Thank you.
[123:35.22]I cherish you as a roommate.
[123:37.30]You're a really good fucking friend.
[123:38.32]Yeah, there you go.
[123:52.54]What was that?
[123:52.94]Oh, right.
[123:55.18]Can I see him from here?
[123:58.37]He's on top of that building, right?
[124:08.81]Wow, that's crazy.
[124:10.75]Alright, well, we gotta go.
[124:17.29]There's a bone shard.
[124:19.27]Over there.
[124:30.58]I walked into a gravestone.
[124:41.56]Report that guy for stream sniping.
[124:45.42]If I could, I would.
[124:54.33]Next mod?
[124:56.27]No, no, no.
[124:56.93]We got a long night.
[124:58.79]It's only been a couple hours.
[124:59.63]Speaking of a long night.
[125:05.68]What is this guy doing here?
[125:08.18]How did you even get over here?
[125:11.25]How did he get over here?
[125:18.59]Come on, help me, throw this... Just give me the shard.
[125:21.60]I almost just threw up.
[125:44.13]Get up!
[125:45.09]Where am I?
[125:49.51]Get up!
[125:54.45]It's hell.
[125:55.21]Alright, give me the items.
[125:56.01]Isn't there some stuff here?
[125:58.12]There's embers, there's some souls here.
[126:03.90]Also, one of the mods that we have not done yet, that is on tap, is Everybody is an Object.
[126:11.01]Everybody is camouflaged.
[126:20.17]Alright, get me through.
[126:22.75]Patch me in.
[126:25.87]Dickhead.
[126:32.41]Just give me the item.
[126:34.01]Why do I even care about this item?
[126:35.29]It's a fucking club.
[126:37.35]It's a reinforced club.
[126:38.53]It's not good.
[126:40.03]I don't want it.
[126:42.59]I got hit by that on the way in.
[126:45.73]Ah!
[126:58.52]Scythe.
[127:01.10]Might be worth using this.
[127:01.98]Ah, you idiot.
[127:08.78]Oh my god, you idiot.
[127:09.90]Just go.
[127:11.85]Nope, that's the wrong way.
[127:13.57]I have to kill him.
[127:14.25]I have to.
[127:25.54]Let me see.
[127:29.96]So this is... 14, 14.
[127:30.84]105, 18.
[127:45.17]I don't think so.
[127:47.39]It's kind of ugly to swing it.
[128:03.32]That's very just straight up and straight down.
[128:05.98]It's easier to take a look at, easier to see.
[128:23.06]I've been watching for what feels like forever.
[128:25.48]Me and my friends always quote silly dumb quotes.
[128:27.28]Seeing you and Star meet up last year in stream was my favorite part of 2018.
[128:29.66]Keep being you.
[128:30.58]Come visit England.
[128:34.93]England's pretty cool.
[128:36.13]I would visit England.
[128:38.25]But thank you.
[128:40.83]I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
[128:42.17]Isn't there a secret wall somewhere over here?
[128:48.08]I know there is.
[128:51.50]I'm going to Brazil.
[128:55.62]I mean, whatever.
[128:57.76]I don't travel that much, though, guys.
[129:03.95]There's the shortcut there.
[129:06.95]Just got to get back up.
[129:12.33]That's really cool looking.
[129:25.17]Bye.
[129:27.55]See ya.
[129:27.77]Let's get me back to the bonfire.
[129:38.47]Wait, is this even- am I going the right way?
[129:39.83]I don't think I'm going the right way.
[129:41.85]This is not the way to the bonfire.
[129:46.15]I took a wrong turn.
[129:47.99]Holy shit, this is the wrong way.
[129:54.42]It's down there, isn't it?
[129:56.54]No, it's not.
[129:58.14]Is this open?
[130:00.78]Somebody's here.
[130:01.24]I can go down there, right?
[130:16.73]Okay.
[130:17.57]Drop down here.
[130:18.07]Okay.
[130:27.73]Who?
[130:28.31]What?
[130:43.42]God damn it.
[130:45.66]No, isn't that... You gotta go up and you climb that, you open that door over there.
[130:49.66]God damn.
[130:50.60]Eh, oh well.
[131:00.29]Can I run through this whole thing again?
[131:01.75]Just don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.
[131:05.97]No reason to stop.
[131:19.17]Lame two-hour first-person joke!
[131:21.45]I mean, I... I want... I can't... This is not like... This is not a joke.
[131:29.61]I thought this was cool.
[131:42.00]I wanna see you play the whole- I don't think I'll do the whole game like this.
[131:44.18]Okay.
[131:48.60]Did I go the wrong way?
[131:49.76]No, I gotta go get my souls.
[131:58.56]Don't talk to your father like that.
[132:00.14]Okay.
[132:10.71]I knew you were gonna throw that shit.
[132:33.44]Dark Souls 1 is the most funky when played in first person.
[132:38.97]Don't you want to be able to say that you beat Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls, and then Dark Souls 3 again?
[132:49.63]I mean... Not necessarily.
[133:05.97]I just like seeing the bosses.
[133:06.93]Alright, I need... I need more strength, right?
[133:15.50]Or should I just... No, I have to have at least like 15 strength, don't I?
[133:29.95]Just play Dark Souls Snap.
[133:32.27]What is Snap?
[133:33.68]And then you called me an idiot.
[133:44.60]That's not how you get a request fulfilled.
[133:47.14]By the way, if you go to the McDonald's drive-thru, or the Burger King drive-thru, or if you go to any, it doesn't matter.
[133:52.38]Let's just use the drive-thru as an example.
[133:55.28]Hey, welcome to McDonald's.
[133:56.24]How can I help you?
[133:56.82]Hey, yeah, um, could you make me a number one with large fry?
[134:01.44]Idiot.
[134:04.39]They're gonna be like, uh, okay.
[134:08.26]Do you want anything else?
[134:10.44]Uh, yeah.
[134:11.44]Can I get a large soda too, stupid?
[134:18.53]That person is gonna do something bad to your food.
[134:38.31]They'll season it for me.
[134:39.64]No, they won't.
[134:52.92]It's like you go to like the customer... you call up like customer service.
[134:55.12]And you have a problem with your computer or something.
[134:58.70]No, that's not a good example.
[135:02.59]If you call... if you were to like go and get it to like your car repaired or something.
[135:09.01]Yes, I think my brakes are making some weird noises.
[135:13.09]Can you like maybe do a check on my brakes, you fucking idiot?
[135:18.95]That's like ultra rude.
[135:20.66]That's so... You would not do that anywhere else.
[135:27.54]Look, you wouldn't steal a car.
[135:33.76]You wouldn't rob a bank.
[135:39.94]So why would you steal a movie?
[135:49.33]Hi there.
[135:49.63]I can't.
[135:49.97]He's protected.
[135:51.35]He's got... He has a fucking hockey gear on.
[135:54.30]I can't hurt him.
[136:14.20]Idiot.
[136:29.12]Even in other places, okay, but first of all, you'd be like, well, here's the thing, Jeremy.
[136:34.20]You're just broadcasting a live stream on Twitch, and there's a bunch of people here in the audience.
[136:39.80]And we're all here, and we're all watching, so it's like, you know, that person, of course, there's a reason for that.
[136:43.88]Like, someone's gonna call you an idiot for no reason.
[136:45.82]Really.
[136:46.06]When was the last time you went to a play?
[136:49.47]During a live performance, like a performance on stage.
[136:52.05]You were with, like, potentially a thousand people in that audience.
[136:55.53]Right in the middle of Romeo and Juliet drinking the poison, are you gonna stand up and be like, You two suck, idiots!
[137:00.59]You're gonna get thrown out.
[137:13.26]Comparing streaming to fine art.
[137:17.59]A school play is fine art?
[137:21.98]like a retelling of like the eighth grade Lion King is fine art is that what you're saying to me no I know I'm lost because are you calling them an idiot no I'm
[137:50.22]You see, I almost walked into that one, but no.
[137:52.74]No, I've got a lot going on upstairs.
[137:55.12]So I'm able to dodge and swing and slip around those slippery questions.
[138:12.82]Alright, let's do this one.
[138:14.60]This is gonna be cool in first person.
[138:22.55]Come on, activate.
[138:25.73]Activate!
[138:32.98]I just want to look at it, I just want to watch.
[138:40.38]Alright, do the sweep, kill everybody.
[138:43.81]Wow, that was close.
[138:44.95]And you're the one that hits me, really?
[138:49.31]Holy shit, that's wild.
[138:53.35]Alright, I gotta, like, pop his pimples.
[138:58.20]Whoa!
[138:58.36]I can't even move.
[139:05.02]What's going... I don't even know what the hell I'm stuck on.
[139:19.69]Alright, give me his arm, his wrist.
[139:21.31]Right under there.
[139:24.73]Right here.
[139:26.07]This thing shouldn't be having a breach, too.
[139:30.89]Where am I?
[139:31.15]What's going on?
[139:33.37]What the hell is that?
[139:44.72]We may have actually hit the wall here.
[139:50.50]It's gonna be so hard to get this.
[139:51.88]Got it!
[139:56.77]Barely.
[139:57.15]If it wasn't for you, I would have probably already done it three times now.
[140:19.87]Oh my goodness.
[140:32.18]Obliterate the balls.
[140:37.38]Isn't this fight optional?
[140:39.44]Yeah, but it's probably one of the cooler bosses to see in first person.
[140:50.04]in my personal pizza, you know.
[141:05.65]We'll go right for his belly, but I still have to break the other parts.
[141:19.48]I'm going to go try to do this very fast.
[141:21.50]I'm going right into his sternum.
[141:26.88]I know you guys are calling it something else, but I refuse to participate in that.
[141:29.52]I'm not going to call it the thing that you guys are calling it.
[141:32.75]It's not nice.
[141:33.23]It's rude.
[141:34.87]Somebody just said idiot.
[141:38.09]I can smell it.
[141:38.63]I can feel it.
[141:39.37]I can feel it.
[141:47.22]Holy shit.
[141:54.60]I'm getting... I'm in like the liquid.
[142:00.29]I'm in a liquid you should not be in.
[142:05.43]Get out of here.
[142:15.13]Holy shit, he just stepped on my head.
[142:17.33]Is he gonna roll on me?
[142:21.42]Is this gonna be music?
[142:39.47]Oh!
[142:50.48]It's scary every time.
[142:51.38]Wow!
[143:08.30]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[143:09.60]Only a few more hits and you should go down.
[143:10.82]Shit!
[143:25.13]I need him to spin around.
[143:26.36]I'm not getting stuck in this at all.
[143:31.94]They're right this way.
[143:32.64]Come on, man.
[143:47.10]What?
[143:47.56]Shouldn't this have blown up by now?
[143:58.18]Jesus.
[144:05.99]I think this encounter might be bugged.
[144:07.49]We'll find out.
[144:08.77]Uh-oh.
[144:23.71]Sweep.
[144:24.21]You can go for a sweep.
[144:29.57]What the f- Oh, they're right next to me.
[144:36.67]Yeah, there's no music either.
[144:44.16]Can't see the enemies behind me.
[144:54.72]Uh...
[145:06.47]I'm fighting a giant baby.
[145:07.83]I'm gonna die to the fucking standard enemy, aren't I?
[145:20.40]Turn music on.
[145:22.76]He's doing a combination by this.
[145:25.26]There's somebody next to me!
[145:25.94]There's somebody next to me!
[145:30.08]Where are they?
[145:30.66]Behind me?
[146:00.65]No, no, no, use this.
[146:02.73]Did I use it?
[146:03.77]What the f- Why?
[146:05.95]What?
[146:17.32]I hit use.
[146:20.26]Shit.
[146:23.73]Alright, this time, I'm gonna get it this time.
[146:25.39]Alright, get this on the hotbar, because... Like, get these stupid... What the hell is he even on here for?
[146:34.57]He basically died to Pinwheel.
[146:37.24]I didn't die to Pinwheel.
[146:38.08]I just, like, touched my face four times.
[146:41.46]In... No, I'm gonna get it.
[146:49.07]I don't think we're going to see those other mods tonight.
[146:53.25]No.
[146:54.39]This is fun.
[146:55.31]I like this.
[146:56.45]We've got a long night.
[146:57.75]It's only been two and a half hours.
[146:58.83]I really appreciate you giving your best out there.
[147:10.06]Idiot.
[147:18.02]Alright, I'm going for it again.
[147:23.37]This actually is gonna suck if this is a bugged encounter.
[147:26.12]Because of the mods.
[147:27.58]And I have to fight them the whole time with all these idiots around.
[147:48.70]It's so hard to keep track of where these people are.
[147:52.02]Oh, this is not good.
[147:54.88]Thank you for doing that.
[147:55.72]I really appreciate it.
[148:03.49]Why are you here?
[148:04.97]What is he doing?
[148:07.03]He just stabbed me in the chest!
[148:09.01]I lost control of my- What are you doing?!
[148:11.59]Why can you do that?!
[148:12.68]UGH!
[148:34.25]Where is he?
[148:38.33]There's almost like an ankle somewhere.
[148:40.67]Really?
[148:45.53]Am I not even hitting this?
[148:47.77]No.
[149:00.16]Did he actually hit me with that?
[149:13.85]I can't believe he actually got it.
[149:18.61]Let's go.
[149:31.43]Oh my god, this is hell!
[149:33.35]This is living hell!
[149:42.64]What?
[149:44.42]Get away from me!
[149:58.22]Come here, get...
[150:04.79]He's too big!
[150:09.39]I think we may have found the wall.
[150:11.96]It's very possible.
[150:13.70]Alright.
[150:14.94]I don't know why that- you saw it happen last- I took him down to like 30% last time.
[150:20.30]What's up with that?
[150:21.82]Here we go!
[150:22.12]What?
[150:22.37]Oh.
[150:27.64]I'm not gonna... That just actually kind of scared me.
[150:38.91]So why does it happen that time?
[150:43.31]And another one like on his elbow.
[150:52.31]Alright, fine.
[150:52.90]I'm gonna do it.
[150:58.94]Gotta get the one on his back, he like rolls.
[151:03.68]Come on, fall down.
[151:07.36]Gotta get with the overhead swing, the only way I can hit it.
[151:15.87]What have you done?
[151:16.43]What have you done?
[151:22.99]What do you think?
[151:23.55]What have you done?
[151:24.37]Why have you done that?
[151:36.70]Ah!
[151:38.63]Ah!
[151:40.69]Pop it!
[151:40.97]Okay.
[151:45.11]Now he has to go one more on... What is it?
[151:48.55]On his thigh.
[151:50.69]Here.
[152:08.88]Bop it.
[152:09.32]I'm trying to bop it.
[152:12.30]It's hard to bop.
[152:12.94]Get the fuck away from me!
[152:21.47]Please don't do it!
[152:23.29]Oh, judging, judging the distance!
[152:27.75]Die!
[152:29.45]Where's the last one?
[152:34.91]He's on his elbow.
[152:40.42]He has to fall down for that one.
[152:43.07]Come on, stand up.
[152:47.99]Stand up and walk and then fall.
[152:53.61]Oh, what have I thought about doing here?
[152:56.07]You can hit the hand.
[153:06.20]I'm not risking it.
[153:10.98]He falls straight down.
[153:13.63]I just- am I gauging this- Which elbow is it?
[153:17.85]Other elbow.
[153:18.67]Fuck.
[153:19.81]I'm so scared.
[153:20.65]I- I gotta get on the right side.
[153:28.93]Wait, it's on his hand?
[153:29.77]Didn't I get the- I thought I got the one on his hand already.
[153:35.30]He's rolling.
[153:35.92]Which-
[153:47.95]The whole hand?
[153:48.59]Yeah, but this is another actual, like, blood boil.
[153:52.01]Alright, here we go.
[153:54.65]He's gonna fall.
[153:55.25]Got him.
[154:02.40]He's dead.
[154:13.52]Hooray.
[154:21.31]I didn't almost die to the Pinwheel of Dark Souls 3.
[154:23.79]Guess what?
[154:24.11]If you played Dark Souls 1 with this mod, Pinwheel would probably be hard.
[154:29.79]You probably would lose to Pinwheel.
[154:33.71]Are you calling me an idiot?
[154:50.38]No.
[154:52.62]Alright, two and a half hours.
[154:53.60]I think it's time for a wine break.
[155:08.51]I think I'm gonna get a glass of wine.
[155:10.47]What do you think?
[155:13.65]Should I?
[155:14.21]Does that sound like fun to you?
[155:15.17]Alright, I need fifteen.
[155:20.94]Fifteen strength, and then... What does this even scale off of?
[155:24.10]I haven't even been paying attention to that.
[155:27.90]Just D, D. D. Okay.
[155:30.98]But I can use it with one hand.
[155:42.63]A break from whining.
[155:43.57]This sounds pretty good.
[155:44.49]Have I... I haven't been whining.
[155:47.71]Fifteen, and then I'm gonna go...
[155:56.36]15, 15, 15.
[155:56.44]Look at this quality build.
[156:02.34]Are you using chat as an excuse to drink?
[156:07.30]What?
[156:12.36]I need a big, cool shield.
[156:14.37]Physical hunter, that's the night shield.
[156:19.01]Magic, physical.
[156:19.85]We're going with this one.
[156:23.08]I mean, I know it's really annoying and it's in the way, but come on.
[156:26.07]Can I... I can stab... I can't.
[156:28.09]I need a proper spear for that.
[156:35.77]If VR worked, this would you do it?
[156:39.13]It'd be interesting, but impossible.
[156:42.83]Just the nature of how this game is played is you can't... I don't know if there'd be a way to bind right stick or mouse to head, maybe.
[156:59.25]Oh no, but wait a second though.
[157:01.43]That's right, that boss soul IS a spear.
[157:04.57]But is it a piece of shit?
[157:06.63]I've never used it.
[157:07.15]I'm not tall enough.
[157:11.71]I'm not tall enough to jump over there either.
[157:17.08]It is?
[157:17.30]Let me see.
[157:27.38]Okay.
[157:32.29]Arstor's Spear.
[157:39.61]Take a large step forward to make a single focused thrust.
[157:51.80]Maybe it's worth trying.
[157:58.91]I was under the assumption that in Dark Souls 3, pretty much all the boss soul weapons are absolutely terrible.
[158:05.62]Unless you're doing PvP.
[158:10.04]I heard that some of the boss soul weapons are good in PvP, but not for PvE.
[158:13.40]Is that what I've been told?
[158:14.80]That's wrong.
[158:20.91]Why does everybody have to lie to me?
[158:24.81]Alright, I don't think I want this
[158:28.48]Although maybe I do.
[158:29.44]It might be worth trying.
[158:34.92]The Rotted Greatsword is amazing.
[158:42.65]Get the Greatsword.
[158:43.47]Yeah, but I can't... Can I even use this?
[158:48.71]I'm going to try to use the Spear.
[158:50.62]I have... I don't have Nineteenth.
[158:59.86]I need Dex.
[159:01.00]But I can get Dex.
[159:12.79]18, 19.
[159:14.11]But it's probably quick.
[159:15.05]Hmm.
[159:20.98]This is a great sword, though.
[159:21.90]It's going to be slow as hell.
[159:28.99]Yeah, this is not gonna work in first person.
[159:31.07]I'm going with the Spear.
[159:31.75]Everyone's gonna be very upset.
[159:33.71]VERY upset with me.
[159:43.23]It's got poison on it too, nice.
[159:53.38]Alright, I need 19 decks.
[159:59.89]What do I have right now?
[160:01.37]I have some of these.
[160:02.42]How many do I need to level up? 3600.
[160:25.82]The streamer has made an error.
[160:28.20]Yeah, but I mean, we're just doing like... This is not a full playthrough.
[160:31.46]This is playing with first person with mods.
[160:35.32]It's okay if I pick the bad weapon, isn't it?
[160:40.38]God damn it, I need like fucking 45 souls.
[160:44.40]Alright, well I gotta go get those souls.
[160:51.81]So...
[160:54.42]This is a full playthrough.
[160:56.28]What?
[160:56.52]I might as well just go get the pickaxe.
[161:11.01]Alright, so... Now we go to...
[161:19.97]Uh, what is actually the next thing?
[161:22.25]That's optional.
[161:24.07]Just to get the... What actually is the next boss?
[161:31.72]Oh, the Abyss Watchers.
[161:32.70]Right, okay.
[161:33.78]I remember.
[161:34.64]But I'm gonna just kill a guy and then go level up because I want to level up Dexterity.
[161:55.01]Let's go.
[161:57.20]Abyss Watchers is going to end the first person thing.
[162:00.70]It very well may.
[162:03.44]But that's alright.
[162:04.12]Okay, where... Where the hell is the bonfire?
[162:15.27]I just was on it.
[162:17.22]It's so disorienting.
[162:19.40]Down here.
[162:29.83]Yeah, Abyss Watchers could be the wall.
[162:34.27]And then we will turn on something else.
[162:37.49]Or who knows?
[162:38.59]I might beat Abyss Watchers first try.
[162:42.79]I did Bort first try.
[162:45.42]Anything's possible.
[162:53.93]Alright, let's go to the Watchers.
[163:00.07]Wait, I was supposed to go get a glass of wine.
[163:02.18]Yeah, we're only three hours in, guys.
[163:04.84]What time is it?
[163:06.98]It's like 6.30.
[163:07.94]We're good.
[163:08.80]I can drink a glass of wine.
[163:10.32]Let's give it a go.
[163:13.42]I'll be right back.
[163:30.87]I haven't left yet.
[163:32.01]I haven't had a glass of wine on stream in like three and a half weeks.
[163:34.78]Four weeks.
[163:35.20]It's been like a month.
[163:37.40]I can't enjoy a glass of wine on stream once a month?
[163:40.54]And once every couple months?
[163:46.54]No, no, no, no, no.
[163:47.66]I thought you left.
[163:48.48]Sometimes I just sit here and just take a look at what you guys are saying.
[163:52.08]And I determine if I like what you're saying.
[163:54.86]If you don't, then I will ban the words.
[163:56.32]I will make it so you can't say those things.
[164:03.05]I'm gonna first try the Abyss Watchers in first person.
[164:06.28]Or if I don't, then I'm gonna not drink the wine.
[164:10.48]I'll pour it into the sink.
[164:12.42]On stream.
[164:13.86]I'm not gonna do that.
[168:54.16]I broke the fucking cork.
[168:56.78]It's alright though.
[168:58.00]I was just struggling down there.
[168:59.34]I was struggling to get this thing open.
[169:03.90]I have a new wine opener that I haven't used.
[169:07.24]I fucked it all up.
[169:08.78]Alright.
[169:14.12]It's the first time trying this.
[169:16.92]Who knows, it could be fucking gross.
[169:20.22]Why do I have this hair all over this?
[169:23.94]I can't even drink- There's hair in this.
[169:26.08]A ton of it.
[169:28.98]Is this glass even clean?
[169:30.21]There's like dog hair in here.
[169:32.09]God damn it.
[169:34.63]I just wanted to drink a- A little bit of wine.
[169:38.17]Who cares.
[169:38.57]Alright, let's go.
[169:40.23]Where are we going?
[169:40.65]We're going to under the bridge.
[169:47.05]Jeremy, if you get drunk can you sing a Foo Fighters song for us?
[169:50.01]You think a glass of wine is going to get me drunk?
[169:53.40]What?
[169:59.36]Pretty good.
[170:00.62]Alright, let's go.
[170:02.59]Watcher's first try.
[170:04.49]Where I piss in the sink.
[170:08.25]So the question is, ah, I gotta go.
[170:09.77]I remember now.
[170:10.47]I'm gonna go this way.
[170:25.44]I forgot he did that.
[170:26.36]He does it like five times, right?
[170:29.15]Supercharged!
[170:35.02]What the fuck am I thinking?
[170:41.92]I don't even need to fight this guy.
[170:44.54]I'm not... I don't even need to fight this guy.
[170:46.25]Can I get his bowl?
[170:55.13]Is he gonna go across?
[171:05.10]That was pretty ridiculous in first person.
[171:07.64]I'm not a dog, they're the worst.
[171:19.75]Oh shi- He just ollied me.
[171:27.62]Okay, cool trick.
[171:30.14]Way this way.
[171:36.56]Stop playing leapfrog!
[171:37.46]Get out of my pathing!
[171:42.24]Help!
[171:43.96]Bart- What's his name?
[171:44.71]Bart?
[171:46.99]Don't- You can't kill him, right?
[171:53.79]Get the fucking dogs away from me!
[172:04.37]Ah!
[172:14.14]Somebody is shaking me violently.
[172:21.01]Good job.
[172:29.48]Nice work, Jeremy.
[172:47.48]Okay.
[172:50.78]Play Simpsons hit and run first person.
[172:53.12]I'll do that now.
[172:54.10]Right now.
[172:56.50]I remember this guy.
[172:57.36]He's got a cool hammer.
[173:19.44]I'm going to go up the elevator and around, and then you... We're finally... We're going to get to see... What's his name?
[173:24.96]I, Sigward of Katarida.
[173:28.36]We'll see that moment later.
[173:31.18]Is that Eliad?
[173:32.82]Of course I'm not going to do that right now.
[173:43.59]Donnie, can you go?
[173:44.55]It's like two... Yeah, it's ready.
[173:46.53]Oops.
[173:47.23]Oops.
[173:48.16]You alright?
[173:51.36]You actually get to see what he looks like.
[173:58.49]Oh, pardon me.
[173:59.81]I was absorbed in thought.
[174:01.88]I am Siegvert of Katarina.
[174:04.16]To be honest, I'm in a bit of a pickle.
[174:08.04]Have you ever walked near a white birch only to be struck by... Well, whoever it is, I... But I have to.
[174:13.90]Well... Okay, well, everybody loves this guy.
[174:17.33]This lift only... This... This guy, we... Everybody loves him, but I'm gonna push him into the elevator.
[174:25.47]Just fuck him.
[174:28.09]I'm just kidding.
[174:32.47]Don't skip his dialog.
[174:33.53]You've heard his dialog like three times.
[174:37.96]Those of you Dark Souls fanatics, you've... Almost just botched that one.
[174:52.61]Wait, no.
[174:54.79]That's the actual way to go.
[175:02.09]Uh oh.
[175:10.05]Shit.
[175:11.05]I wasn't supposed to do that.
[175:11.79]Is there anywhere I can fall?
[175:19.28]I don't think I can... Can I land on one of these brackets here?
[175:22.58]I don't think so.
[175:26.29]I could do a homeward bone.
[175:48.39]Well, you can't do that.
[175:49.19]Sorry, I know we don't.
[175:52.65]That just gave me anxiety.
[175:54.01]I'm sorry.
[175:55.79]It is very anxious in first person though.
[176:04.52]I remember complaining about this bridge, because I remember running back and the whole bridge is filled with people.
[176:08.56]I remember this.
[176:26.89]That's creepy.
[176:28.97]Alright, close the door.
[176:29.97]Oh no!
[176:35.77]No!
[176:36.82]No!
[176:37.42]No!
[176:37.82]Zygward!
[176:39.54]Squidward!
[176:41.50]Good luck, Squidward!
[176:42.64]Go up!
[176:57.07]He'll be fine.
[177:02.60]No, I have to wait till they despawn before I can help him.
[177:11.70]I didn't even get my souls.
[177:12.63]I didn't have any souls.
[177:13.59]Who cares?
[177:14.05]Oh, I forgot about this guy.
[177:33.87]Just run.
[177:34.39]Just run.
[177:34.86]I don't need to fight him.
[177:36.02]Run away.
[177:36.50]He can't come out of his domain.
[177:50.73]Alright.
[177:50.95]Give me the bonfire.
[178:03.00]I can't even let them do anything.
[178:04.02]These guys will kill me in one second.
[178:05.46]The bonfire is like right here.
[178:14.41]Where's the bonfire?
[178:15.09]It's right here.
[178:18.04]Where is it?
[178:22.76]Don't say boomer vision.
[178:24.10]It is boomer vision.
[178:24.98]It's first person vision.
[178:26.06]Where is it?
[178:26.44]It's right here.
[178:52.82]Actually blind.
[178:53.92]I'm thinking of the second bonfire.
[178:56.00]The other bonfire is up on a hill like that.
[178:57.56]Come on, it's been like two years since I played this game, and I'm in FPS mode.
[179:10.15]No, I thought I killed him.
[179:18.46]I got a backstab.
[179:20.22]No, that's not clean enough.
[179:21.32]Go back.
[179:34.84]Yeah, I- hold on.
[179:36.69]I'm gonna kill this guy.
[179:40.12]We're gonna fight this guy the way that I should be fighting this guy, which is with the shield.
[180:02.62]Oh my goodness.
[180:03.76]Oh my goodness.
[180:07.04]Oh no.
[180:16.74]Did I do the pleb filter?
[180:34.74]That's not... It's different when you have this... I'm not even gonna explain myself.
[180:39.41]Why would I explain myself?
[180:40.51]Can this guy even be carried?
[180:47.11]Let me chest self.
[180:49.23]I don't think he can be carried.
[181:04.52]He can be.
[181:05.62]If we get good.
[181:06.22]I don't think he can.
[181:12.22]Watch out for that frost dude.
[181:33.20]It's just so hard to turn that fast.
[181:34.80]Because locking on doesn't do it.
[181:57.20]It's possible.
[181:58.52]Still possible.
[182:04.63]Jesus!
[182:05.23]I don't even know what the fuck he is.
[182:21.32]Almost got him.
[182:21.74]One more hit.
[182:22.18]Two more hits.
[182:22.56]Got him.
[182:28.44]Damn.
[182:29.67]With the sword.
[182:37.97]Somebody just pressed F. Somebody said F. That was a little early to press F. I need to practice.
[182:51.30]Yeah, this thing is cool.
[182:52.32]I mean, look at it.
[182:57.07]It looks cool in first person too.
[183:10.65]Be Iceman?
[183:11.29]No, I can't be Iceman.
[183:17.55]I could.
[183:17.95]I could.
[183:26.81]This doesn't scale with magic at all.
[183:28.41]It just has Frost effect on it.
[183:29.81]I mean, I've already got the... It's just scales with just D in both of them.
[183:43.51]For now, though, we're going to continue to use the weapon that has good scaling and damage right now.
[183:50.56]Go help Sigward.
[183:51.40]He's crying.
[183:51.90]I will.
[183:56.54]Yeah, I'm trying to think of the... There are going to be a few moments that will probably actually be uncompletable.
[184:10.11]I wonder what they are.
[184:13.91]Some of the bosses that move around so quickly that you can't turn to see them.
[184:27.43]Alright.
[184:27.79]Alright, Sigward.
[184:31.62]You're up there.
[184:38.02]The gator dogs?
[184:41.74]Yeah, I know I have a lot of other mods, but...
[184:45.81]I'm still very much enjoying what we're doing right now.
[184:51.69]Hmm.
[184:52.83]Oops.
[184:55.78]Well, actually, I need to go up here anyways.
[184:57.44]Mr. Giant.
[185:13.33]Okay.
[185:18.62]So, cut the shit.
[185:23.56]Kill, kill, kill!
[185:24.88]Don't say that, stop saying that.
[185:31.20]Alright, now let's do the Sigward questline, which is this way.
[185:37.25]No, I was looking the wrong way.
[185:38.59]First person makes you disoriented.
[185:57.29]Oh, don't disappear like that.
[185:59.16]You had me downright worried.
[186:02.18]But thanks to you, an epiphany has struck me.
[186:05.72]I've unraveled the riddle of this inscrutable lift.
[186:12.44]Alright, you ready to fight the big monster?
[186:14.72]I went up the tower.
[186:17.70]Anyhow, do you see that?
[186:20.40]That humongous beast?
[186:22.32]He looks even better in first person.
[186:23.60]I'm no coward and I have a steady hand, but that thing makes... Now, now, think twice before you go down that road.
[186:32.30]Alright, that means you're going to help.
[186:33.34]Let's go.
[186:34.12]I've got to... Wait, you weren't supposed to do that without me.
[186:40.54]I, Sigmar of Hellarina...
[186:43.85]Here he comes.
[186:51.96]He goes... It's like a really hard, strange beginning of the vowel there.
[186:57.02]He goes... Ready?
[186:57.92]No!
[186:58.14]You should have waited!
[186:58.99]Well...
[187:13.26]This is awesome in first person.
[187:16.66]Ooh!
[187:16.80]Nice swing.
[187:17.16]Good job, Siegward.
[187:17.78]We can work together.
[187:18.58]Don't call for a flip.
[187:49.74]Cocktail!
[187:50.26]Cocktail!
[187:52.77]We did it.
[188:18.94]And this is when you learn the toast.
[188:19.98]You can do the beer.
[188:20.64]That was cool.
[188:24.82]Shake a burro.
[188:25.26]Kidding, I'm not gonna kill him.
[188:54.25]Alright, there's some items that I remember.
[188:57.21]Why are we doing Dark Souls 3 again?
[188:58.37]Well, because this is a different kind of Dark Souls.
[189:01.63]This is Dark Souls 3.
[189:04.25]But as you can see, there's something else going on here.
[189:07.43]An interesting mod to play the game in first person.
[189:11.47]I didn't toast him.
[189:12.15]Why would I?
[189:12.47]It's the same, but different.
[189:20.00]That's true.
[189:26.13]I thought this was VR.
[189:29.91]I would go put on the VR helmet and make the VR joke, but I don't have it anymore.
[189:43.28]Go back and toast, or I'm gonna leave.
[189:46.44]Well, just because you said that, I'm gonna go do a full R2 and hit him off the cliff.
[190:02.08]There's a really nice ring that's up here in there.
[190:07.96]Somewhere.
[190:08.38]It's up over that way.
[190:10.90]I got a full R2.
[190:11.90]Swing this guy.
[190:13.20]Fine.
[190:13.50]Here's your taunt.
[190:15.00]What is it?
[190:15.94]Okay.
[190:16.40]Toast.
[190:23.18]Here, here.
[190:24.20]A toast.
[190:27.93]To our never-ending friendship.
[190:35.85]There it is.
[190:44.80]I love how you're the only competent Souls streamer I've seen this year!
[190:53.01]That means a lot, considering I've struggled a lot with this game when I first played it.
[190:57.15]I am playing in gosh-damn first person!
[191:06.45]Wow, what a confidence boost.
[191:09.11]Thank you for that.
[191:09.75]Seriously, that was a super confidence boost.
[191:12.06]I can do anything now.
[191:13.72]I'm capable of anything.
[191:16.50]For real, thank you.
[191:18.44]This year...
[191:20.16]Yeah, but there are some incredibly talented, amazing Souls players.
[191:24.20]People that beat the game without getting hit.
[191:25.52]People that beat the game in fucking 45 minutes.
[191:28.70]People that get lost in an area that they don't remember because they haven't played the game in a while and they forget where they're going.
[191:34.35]You know, there are those streamers out there.
[191:36.29]And be careful.
[191:37.39]Don't watch them.
[191:40.15]If you come across somebody that, like, is kind of walking in circles and they don't really remember where to go, like, do not watch that stream because is it really worth watching?
[191:49.43]Be careful of those strings.
[191:57.96]There's two ladies upstairs from what I remember.
[192:03.62]There's two fat ladies up here.
[192:04.94]I remember doing this.
[192:06.70]But there's something nice up here.
[192:08.88]It's worth a try.
[192:16.48]Yep.
[192:17.46]Sometimes I don't remember
[192:19.52]where the, uh, where the enemies are spawned, and it's alright.
[192:25.13]This year.
[192:25.91]Yeah, well, that's okay.
[192:28.81]That's a, that's a good, that's a compliment.
[192:30.57]I'm sorry, it is.
[192:45.11]Dogs, right?
[192:47.25]Holy shit, didn't even see you.
[192:48.43]This is not good.
[192:50.84]Oh, there's three.
[192:51.28]There's too many.
[192:51.96]I gotta run.
[192:55.08]Come on.
[192:55.40]Now I gotta keep up.
[192:56.06]I gotta keep up.
[192:57.34]This year, right?
[192:58.14]Come on.
[193:12.13]Okay, we're good.
[193:19.68]I got a reputation now to uphold.
[193:26.92]I know there are two ladies up here.
[193:31.35]I just really hope they don't turn off my stream.
[193:37.88]Come on, fall.
[193:40.36]Come on.
[193:41.90]All of you come down.
[193:42.62]I know you will.
[193:43.76]There they are.
[193:46.18]What's the strategy?
[193:46.72]What's the game plan here for these two in first person?
[193:49.77]Somebody just gave a ton of money.
[193:50.63]$35.
[193:50.65]$3,500 bits from Ragarnoi.
[193:53.71]Thank you.
[194:04.59]I was going to donate a million bits since you're playing like a pro Dark Souls player, but then I remembered that you died to Pinwheel and it was shameful.
[194:23.67]Well, thank you so much for the $35.
[194:26.99]But the person that said I was the most competent Souls player this year, I want you to make sure you understand this.
[194:32.17]That's a joke.
[194:32.71]It's a lie.
[194:34.00]I beat Pinwheel First Try on a blind playthrough last year.
[194:38.04]It's a joke.
[194:38.70]It's a funny thing.
[194:39.50]I'm still your favorite Dark Souls streamer this year.
[194:42.22]Alright, we're gonna Alluring Skull and run.
[194:53.91]Hello?
[194:54.11]Hello?
[195:06.25]Alright, here's the ring.
[195:14.28]Flynn's ring.
[195:15.04]I remember this being very good.
[195:20.26]Isn't there something else up top here too?
[195:30.57]Lowering equipment load increases attack.
[195:34.31]Just put the damn thing on.
[195:40.78]So this is it.
[195:41.18]You take off all your clothes.
[195:43.38]Alright, we gotta go.
[195:52.87]Where's the other one?
[195:53.43]There's another one over here, right?
[195:59.57]Gonna make this jump down to here.
[196:01.05]And there's an item over here.
[196:05.19]No, that's not what I was looking for.
[196:12.50]Nudity equals power.
[196:13.58]Maybe I should just take it all off now.
[196:23.55]Oh, fuck.
[196:24.73]Okay, hold on.
[196:25.33]We can go from here to there.
[196:34.05]I'm gonna die here.
[196:39.15]It's not gonna be pretty.
[196:43.70]Oh, I'm good.
[196:51.08]There's the vest.
[196:52.18]The trousers.
[196:58.47]Okay, that's the ring I'm thinking of.
[196:59.83]This is the anti-poison one, right?
[197:03.77]No, no, no.
[197:04.30]That's the best ring in the game.
[197:05.48]That's the best ring in the whole game.
[197:06.42]Now I remember.
[197:18.90]Didn't I take my gloves off?
[197:22.20]Why do I still have these night gloves on?
[197:29.23]Alright, now we can keep progressing.
[197:31.59]Am I gonna beat Dark Souls 3 tonight on stream?
[197:34.61]In first person?
[197:36.91]Absolutely not.
[197:37.57]But, I mean, we're still going.
[197:47.71]Alright.
[197:48.82]I could probably just bone out of here.
[197:50.02]Yeah, I'm just gonna bone.
[197:55.42]What was the last... It doesn't matter.
[197:59.95]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[198:00.57]In Dark Souls 3, it doesn't matter.
[198:16.45]Maybe I should just upgrade this and just keep going with it.
[198:20.50]I'm never going to be cool enough to have the spear, I don't think.
[198:25.36]Is it 18, right?
[198:30.20]I could get it.
[198:30.66]Yeah, let's put the spear on.
[198:32.22]Let's do the thing we wanted to do.
[198:38.32]How many more do I need?
[198:42.48]For this piece of absolute shit.
[198:45.10]Where is it?
[198:48.06]19.
[198:49.64]I can get that shit right now.
[198:53.77]This thing's really ugly.
[198:58.71]It's got a nice feel to it though.
[199:00.47]It's quick.
[199:03.24]He lied about having other mods.
[199:04.94]That's not true.
[199:05.78]I have a bunch.
[199:16.54]Show us, then!
[199:20.46]I can't, though, because we're doing so- we're having so much fun.
[199:29.42]We can come back to this?
[199:41.09]No, but look at it.
[199:42.89]I'm having a great time.
[199:43.91]I can't stop.
[199:44.43]I'm sorry.
[199:58.02]Stop having fun.
[199:59.54]No, I refuse.
[200:01.13]I refuse to stop having fun.
[200:06.28]Change mods and go back to the save?
[200:07.88]Yeah, I could.
[200:09.54]Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[200:10.66]Are you ready?
[200:13.10]I'm gonna... Go beat Abyss Watchers.
[200:19.71]And then... After Abyss Watchers... Sure.
[200:30.51]How playable is this mod?
[200:32.41]From what you can see on the screen, it's... It's very playable.
[200:37.71]I thought the dodge roll was going to be headache-inducing.
[200:39.72]It's not.
[200:41.44]What it essentially does is it just fixes the camera in a spot that is always pointing forward.
[200:48.48]No matter where.
[200:50.34]So, it's pretty great.
[200:53.78]Oh, the Crystal Mage.
[200:54.89]Oh, no.
[200:55.51]The Crystal Mage.
[200:56.21]I died 15 times to Crystal Mage in my first playthrough.
[200:58.45]It's probably going to happen again.
[201:02.33]Alright, let's go.
[201:03.57]Let's go.
[201:03.83]I can use this with two hands, right?
[201:05.69]No, I can't.
[201:09.09]I need another level.
[201:09.69]I have so many of these.
[201:12.11]That's almost as embarrassing as Pinwheel.
[201:21.54]That's fine.
[201:30.05]You have to do Crystal Mage in first person.
[201:31.53]That's going to make it a thousand times harder.
[201:35.23]I also, I want the... I love this.
[201:42.33]Here's the thing about Dark Souls and Souls games in general.
[201:45.36]Those of you that are here, that are big fans of these games.
[201:50.44]If I could Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and wipe out me ever playing this game, I would do it like once a month.
[201:58.03]I don't know if that would cause irreparable damage to my brain, but it'd be great.
[202:04.27]Being able to play this game and experience it again in a way that you never have, it's really fun.
[202:16.68]So, I'm sort of vicariously living through myself again.
[202:19.80]If that makes sense.
[202:22.00]I didn't realize it was going to be this much fun.
[202:36.04]It does not make sense.
[202:38.86]Well, it doesn't have to.
[202:42.27]Get those funny mods on, you clown streamer.
[202:45.47]Yeah, but not every single stream has to be a clown stream.
[202:48.25]Right?
[202:48.47]Don't you know?
[202:48.97]We can do first versus Dark Souls.
[202:52.33]That's objectively wrong.
[203:00.82]No, we don't have to have every stream be a clown stream.
[203:04.73]I promise, like, in a couple days, you'll hear me go like, It'll happen.
[203:22.93]Really?
[203:23.27]Yeah.
[203:25.08]I promise you'll hear at least one or two clown horns.
[203:30.76]Oh fuck.
[203:39.73]And it doesn't matter, because we're about to get to the Abyss Watchers.
[203:42.77]And I'm going to quit the game.
[203:44.47]And I'm going to start over, and we're going to do x40 speed.
[203:47.93]And then everyone can make their clown noise.
[203:50.58]Clown horns.
[203:56.82]You're like two hours away.
[203:58.18]Not for somebody that's played this game two or three times.
[204:00.66]In a row.
[204:01.54]On stream.
[204:02.18]And then off stream.
[204:03.22]And then as sorcery.
[204:04.29]And beat the game as sorcery.
[204:16.25]Okay, where's the butcher's knife lady?
[204:19.42]Not until over here.
[204:20.14]Is my attack actually being increased right now?
[204:31.44]I feel like it's not.
[204:35.32]Jesus, that's scary.
[204:36.98]Somebody else is here.
[204:37.68]Isn't that one inside of the circus wagon?
[204:59.25]No, don't do it.
[205:00.33]No.
[205:01.31]Don't do it.
[205:05.95]Respect to pure faith after Abyss Watchers.
[205:09.93]You know, I just might do that.
[205:13.17]Probably not, though, because I have the spear.
[205:15.81]You can't... How do you... What?
[205:21.45]Why is that video thing even a command anymore?
[205:24.09]What video thing?
[205:26.96]There's a video command thing?
[205:28.30]A spear.
[205:39.29]Isn't there... There's a lady over there.
[205:41.13]Yes, there she is.
[205:42.35]Found her.
[205:47.01]Let's kill the butcher.
[205:50.34]And get the butcher's cleaver.
[205:56.26]There you are.
[205:57.20]Come on.
[205:58.38]Remember I made the Wizard of Oz reference when I first streamed this game?
[206:05.27]Okay, alright.
[206:06.19]Calm down, lady.
[206:25.08]OH SHIT!
[206:37.73]Oh shit!
[206:52.61]What's your knife?
[206:53.01]It's a pretty good weapon.
[206:56.15]I think I used this for a majority of time that I played Dark Souls 3 the first time.
[207:03.39]pretty good weapon it has believe a scaling which uh you know what I mean wait a minute so
[207:35.64]Remember, I got grounded because you cursed.
[207:42.28]Well, put me on speaker.
[207:45.28]Am I on speaker?
[207:48.70]Let me know when I'm on your speakers.
[207:55.10]Okay.
[207:57.46]Hey, Ma.
[208:00.16]I'm really sorry about the cursing there.
[208:03.22]I got a little too intense, a little too worked up.
[208:05.62]Just want to make sure that you understand that I typically run a PG-13 stream.
[208:11.78]And sometimes an F word or one of those other bad words slip out sometimes.
[208:18.65]I really am sorry about that.
[208:19.81]Please, please let your son still watch my stream.
[208:27.94]I promise I'll never say any bad words ever again.
[208:34.60]I need his money!
[208:35.30]I need his money!
[208:38.02]No, I don't... Don't take me out of context there.
[208:45.64]I need his money.
[208:46.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[208:54.56]I remember this part.
[208:55.36]They all come at you on the bridge.
[208:59.47]Daaaah!
[209:02.89]Shut up.
[209:03.19]Everybody shut up, we're fine.
[209:07.87]I just found a secret!
[209:12.56]What's that noise?
[209:15.68]It's getting louder, what is that noise?
[209:17.28]Why is there Silent Hill sounds?
[209:46.93]Yeah, I'm gonna do the same.
[209:48.35]Ah, same to you.
[209:49.11]Hey, dummies.
[209:53.63]Uh, Mourn's Ring.
[209:54.44]I'll take the free shit.
[209:57.20]Braille Divine Tomb of Karm.
[210:03.42]Uh... Boosts and Miracles.
[210:06.34]Whatever.
[210:08.39]Grounded?
[210:08.83]I'm sorry.
[210:09.41]Ma'am.
[210:10.01]Ma'am!
[210:10.77]Ma'am, I'm sorry.
[210:11.57]Ma'am?
[210:11.77]Ma'am?
[210:28.34]Great Corvinside.
[210:29.50]That's a rare drop.
[210:30.74]That's a rare, like, 85% drop.
[210:31.92]Where?
[210:34.00]Where is he?
[210:36.62]Oh my god, this is terrifying.
[210:42.04]I gotta get out.
[210:42.82]Is there two of them?
[210:44.96]There are two here.
[210:53.79]Oh!
[210:55.07]Where is he?
[210:56.11]Oh!
[210:58.07]No!
[210:58.37]I'm facing the wrong fucking direction!
[211:17.66]Listen, ma'am.
[211:19.08]Sometimes you say the F-word.
[211:21.36]It's just the F-word.
[211:22.12]It's not a big deal.
[211:26.77]Yeah, I'm not one of those disgusting streamers that says we can gross stuff or we can mean stuff.
[211:41.34]I don't say like bad, mean shit.
[211:43.11]I don't want to be like that.
[211:44.29]Sometimes I say F-U-C-K.
[211:46.69]And even spelling it was embarrassing for me.
[211:51.61]I'm sorry.
[212:07.23]Too many noises.
[212:08.59]There's too many noises.
[212:10.59]But there's an item over here.
[212:20.02]What?
[212:20.98]Where am I?
[212:21.50]I'm stuck in the wall.
[212:22.34]I'm stuck in the wall!
[212:25.45]Wait, how do I do this?
[212:26.79]I have to... Something drastic!
[212:38.23]You're too nice, you piece of reed.
[212:44.35]Well, at least the souls will be on the bridge.
[212:51.01]Going right?
[212:51.47]I got the ember.
[212:52.79]Embers are so important, because it's a full heal.
[213:06.35]Can you slap yourself again for a joke?
[213:10.46]No, I'm a PG-13 streamer.
[213:12.68]Where are the souls?
[213:14.87]Oh, they're over there.
[213:15.31]Alright, now should I do the speedrun strat, which is make Guy jump off cliff and then grab sword?
[213:33.09]I've seen that speedrun a few times.
[213:40.90]Let's take a look.
[213:44.68]This is C scaling.
[213:45.68]I need 16 strength.
[213:46.52]Great Corvin's side.
[213:47.20]This is the bleeding one.
[213:53.24]Someone watches AGDQ.
[213:56.14]Well, actually, there was a time when I was watching a lot of Dark Souls streamers that did speedruns because I thought it was interesting.
[214:04.69]Because it just is.
[214:05.63]These games are very hard and very particular.
[214:10.63]No, this thing is not very good.
[214:11.63]16 strength, 18.
[214:15.57]97 plus 29.
[214:16.27]I mean, the goddamn whip is cooler.
[214:23.44]No one cares.
[214:27.68]No one cares.
[214:29.66]What?
[214:31.62]No one cares about what?
[214:32.92]About Dark Souls?
[214:38.37]You wouldn't go to a drive-thru...
[214:40.66]Pull up to the drive-thru.
[214:42.34]Hey, can I help you?
[214:42.96]Hey, no one cares.
[214:45.36]Do you want food, or what are you doing here?
[214:59.56]One guy strikes again.
[215:00.72]It's one guy.
[215:01.48]No one cares.
[215:02.24]It's one guy.
[215:03.02]Alright, let's put on the... Uh...
[215:09.16]I mean, I could kill these two, but isn't this like killing the guy that praises the sun and everyone gets mad?
[215:12.96]No one cares, lady.
[215:37.63]Well, I got the souls.
[215:43.19]Attack her and then fall off and let the guy jump out and kill himself, right?
[215:50.52]Do I have enough for a level up?
[215:51.48]It's possible.
[216:04.21]The real wife... I'm not saying that word.
[216:07.05]The real wife is the blacksmith.
[216:10.02]Alright, now I can use the spear.
[216:19.42]It's time to see what this thing is capable of.
[216:24.82]I've never used it before.
[216:28.54]Let's see with the shield.
[216:30.56]How does it work with the shield?
[216:32.84]Nice.
[216:33.66]R2?
[216:33.94]I kind of like it.
[216:41.71]Say it.
[216:43.11]I'm not going to say that.
[216:54.23]Why not?
[216:54.59]Because I don't want to say it.
[216:58.74]Say it, idiot.
[217:03.55]Look, you wouldn't go to a drive-thru at McDonald's and order a number one, and when the guy says, is there anything else I can help you with?
[217:09.31]Say waifu.
[217:11.41]Sir, I'm not- Sir, please pull your car up.
[217:13.41]For the love of God.
[217:29.86]I thought I was far enough away to do the waifu joke.
[217:39.62]You can be very far away.
[217:41.02]I severely underestimate this.
[217:43.94]The depth is so hard to judge here.
[217:45.69]Hold on.
[217:47.29]Look at that.
[217:48.39]Does it look like I could hit that from here?
[217:50.13]It doesn't, does it?
[217:52.05]I can't.
[217:54.53]But look, you can.
[218:04.34]Alright, let's go.
[218:05.60]Let's go get Abyss Watchers and let's first why the Abyss Watchers.
[218:12.10]This weapon is terrible.
[218:23.47]Hurry up and do something funny, clown idiot streamer!
[218:28.35]They have bigger spears, it's not fair.
[218:33.55]Why do you guys have to be so mean?
[218:35.17]Okay?
[218:41.24]How much of that can I block?
[218:49.96]Judging how far away these guys are is absolutely... You know what?
[218:54.11]It's hell.
[218:54.91]This is hell.
[218:56.79]Right?
[218:56.97]How many times have you heard me say that in this stream?
[219:00.07]Dude, this is hell.
[219:10.50]Why did I just do that?
[219:11.29]I didn't even need to heal.
[219:13.85]I know where to go.
[219:14.39]Me and my fucking candy stick.
[219:27.36]What a great setup I have.
[219:28.65]A shield and a fucking street sausage.
[219:41.20]No, I know where to go, I know where to go, don't worry.
[219:49.90]Ow!
[219:52.18]Ah!
[219:52.30]Ah, he's behind me!
[220:03.15]I need to get that other shard from the first area.
[220:11.00]Shove it.
[220:12.34]Did he ever put his armor back on?
[220:37.01]Watchers are this way.
[220:38.20]I'm not going to worry about the crabs right now.
[220:40.24]I'm just going to get to the other bonfire.
[220:42.58]Shove it.
[220:49.30]One of the things I don't like about the Dark Souls games is this is going to be a what the heck moment for the PG-13 audience here.
[220:55.94]What the heck?
[220:57.51]Why do they get invincibility frames sometimes when they get up from the ground?
[221:00.63]I don't get those.
[221:08.66]Thanks, guys.
[221:13.42]No, I don't.
[221:14.34]Not as many as they do.
[221:15.06]They get like ten frames, and I get fucking four.
[221:16.95]Now this is a mistake, because I need to... Oh, you idiots.
[221:27.53]Not you guys.
[221:28.15]I'm talking about the... I missed the fucking bonfire.
[221:43.22]Where is it?
[221:43.46]It's right here, right?
[221:44.12]Somewhere right here?
[221:44.82]Where is it?
[221:45.12]It's like right here.
[221:48.72]Where's that bonfire?
[221:49.84]I know it's right here somewhere.
[221:55.24]What?
[222:09.65]It was up on the cliff.
[222:10.81]It's alright, I'll get there.
[222:15.36]Your mom said that you're smart.
[222:18.64]Yeah?
[222:19.52]I bet you are.
[222:21.44]These dogs!
[222:43.94]That's a big shield, I might like that.
[223:08.71]Jerma, next mod please.
[223:12.79]A different mod.
[223:14.41]Look, I really don't want to bring up any controversy here, but you wouldn't go to McDonald's and ask for a Whopper at the fucking drive-thru.
[223:23.18]Hey, welcome to McDonald's.
[223:23.90]Can I help you?
[223:24.44]Hey, can I get a Whopper, please?
[223:27.08]Idiot.
[223:27.70]Clown.
[223:43.73]Stop with the McDonald's.
[223:46.11]Alright, let's go, CrystalSage.
[223:51.98]You versus me.
[223:54.46]In a one-on-one battle.
[223:58.50]I'll come back and get these items in like a year.
[224:00.06]Don't worry.
[224:14.62]Can't wait to hear the first line that she says.
[224:16.62]This is gonna be horrible.
[224:49.47]This already sucks.
[224:55.29]Because I can't see where anything is.
[224:57.07]Oh, I'm going to die here.
[225:00.37]This is going to be rough.
[225:03.83]I might have to put the other weapon on.
[225:21.12]Nooo!
[225:28.50]Here come the clones.
[225:36.19]Oh!
[225:45.27]What the heck?
[225:57.52]Oh my goodness!
[225:59.20]They're aiming from every direction!
[226:14.62]Which one's the real one?
[226:15.50]Come on, give me a good roll here!
[226:20.10]That's not the right one.
[226:55.63]Oh, you dick, you're in such a weird spot.
[226:56.49]Yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoy
[227:36.54]What the fuck happened?
[227:38.62]No, the first person camera was not in the right spot and it was one hit.
[227:45.59]What the fuck was that?
[227:52.54]No way.
[227:53.28]I just like wasn't in the right spot.
[227:57.56]You've got to be kidding me!
[227:58.80]That was dumb!
[228:04.12]No, I don't... Give me a fucking break.
[228:10.06]I can't even... Oh, you all know what I'm trying to say.
[228:18.49]Classic YouTube reaction.
[228:21.43]It's over now.
[228:23.35]Oh my god, that hurt my whole fucking body.
[228:25.69]I can't believe it.
[228:27.03]I actually can't believe it.
[228:28.31]It was that simple.
[228:30.91]I didn't get greedy on the last time before he went down, and the second time, I just completely completely missed somehow.
[228:38.29]I'm fucking deleting that weapon.
[228:40.10]That weapon's going in the garbage.
[228:43.52]Lost to the Crystal Sage or the fucking Ember.
[228:46.10]No, but it doesn't count because it's extra hard mode because it's...
[229:00.56]This thing sucks too.
[229:07.04]I can't believe it.
[229:10.00]I'm infuriated right now.
[229:11.34]It's unbelievable to me.
[229:13.67]Why could I let that happen?
[229:24.01]I just, like, upgraded all of this.
[229:25.69]It was so... I was already there.
[229:30.19]Somehow I wasn't lined up correctly, because you can't lock on, get done...
[229:58.96]I'm literally right fucking next to you.
[230:03.56]Go on, do it.
[230:04.60]Shoot it.
[230:07.78]You punk.
[230:12.27]I just love how it doesn't matter what direction I'm facing, something here.
[230:18.65]My mom says I can't watch Family Guy.
[230:20.47]Well, it's alright.
[230:22.47]Family Guy has been awful since, like, season seven.
[230:26.05]Who cares?
[230:38.91]I can't even see where they're fighting me from!
[230:44.93]I can't fucking believe this.
[230:46.09]I did it and I'm just so hyper-tilted right now in that first run.
[230:57.11]I'm upgrading this thing.
[231:00.10]Can I even?
[231:03.38]The Watchers is not even gonna be as hard as this because I only get to see in front of me, so I can't... Like when the blue... When the blue diamond shooters come up, I don't even know where where they're shooting from.
[231:14.39]This is plus one.
[231:18.41]I'm just gonna upgrade this like three fucking times.
[231:21.37]Unbelievable.
[231:39.30]The Watchers aren't gonna destroy me.
[231:49.88]Alright.
[232:00.06]+2, plus three.
[232:01.52]I don't have enough.
[232:03.74]I got plus one.
[232:04.82]+2.
[232:10.75]And I am also going to go get the Estus.
[232:21.03]Which one is it?
[232:21.49]This one?
[232:22.30]Is it tower or is it high wall?
[232:23.80]Where the shard is.
[232:37.77]Didn't he stream this before?
[232:38.67]Yeah, I did.
[232:40.17]But not with the, uh... Not wearing cinder blocks all over my body.
[232:45.87]Alright, down from here?
[232:52.12]I don't remember where it is.
[232:53.16]I think it's down.
[233:02.79]This guy blows up the room.
[233:17.37]How are you still alive?
[233:19.93]Didn't I just upgrade this thing twice?
[233:22.51]Huh?
[233:22.79]What are you still doing here?
[233:25.75]What are you doing?
[233:33.35]Throw the thing.
[233:39.91]Focus streamer goes the wrong fucking way.
[233:46.28]Sorry, I got the Mail Breaker.
[233:47.80]Which I'm not gonna put on.
[233:55.21]God.
[233:55.49]It's cause the weapons suck.
[234:01.27]I cared too much about worrying about the first person shit.
[234:07.34]And I ended up using a bad weapon, bad character.
[234:10.56]It doesn't matter, I'm not gonna use it as an excuse.
[234:14.28]Just give me my Estus.
[234:18.51]I didn't go the right way.
[234:23.56]Bad gamer, bad Estus, bad... Which way is it?
[234:36.35]I really don't remember where this is.
[234:50.21]Oh my god.
[234:51.71]Alright.
[234:55.53]Where the hell is it?
[235:02.13]It's not down that way.
[235:11.36]Should I, uh... I know there's like another way to go down, I just don't remember.
[235:20.86]DS3 GoPro Edition.
[235:36.86]So wait, I was going the right way.
[235:52.88]Why do I always swing at the same time that you do?
[236:03.64]Jerma, go pro.
[236:04.46]Stop being such a noob.
[236:06.18]I can't.
[236:06.62]I'm a noob.
[236:09.50]An upgraded piece of turd is still a turd.
[236:13.40]Yes, it is.
[236:19.31]But it's a better turd.
[236:24.69]See, like, I thought I was facing this way.
[236:26.77]I guess not.
[236:33.21]Alright, now from here... Is the way to go... I think it is actually this way, because I can go down through here, right?
[236:40.45]There's a spear guy here.
[236:44.25]What the hell even hit me?
[236:49.09]Get a load of this guy.
[237:15.92]Alright, I'm sorry that just kind of came up Undead hunter charm
[237:41.25]Bye.
[237:48.75]It's down there.
[237:49.33]All the way.
[237:49.67]Okay.
[237:49.93]Down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[237:51.72]Get down there.
[237:54.90]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[237:56.08]Just give me the Estus Flask.
[237:59.54]It's right on top.
[238:04.06]It's alright.
[238:04.46]It's okay.
[238:04.92]It's okay.
[238:05.36]It's alright.
[238:05.74]Everything's fine.
[238:06.66]It's alright.
[238:10.22]It's not alright.
[238:18.96]Everything's fine.
[238:22.04]Oh no.
[238:22.94]Oh no!
[238:23.32]I forgot I'm freezing!
[238:32.62]Who cares?
[238:33.06]Just die.
[238:33.48]I got the thing I wanted.
[238:36.30]How many jokes did we miss today?
[238:47.81]Well, we got a couple going here.
[238:48.91]We got McDonald's drive-thru.
[238:50.61]We got... It's been like two or three hilarious ones.
[239:13.48]I missed the drive-thru joke.
[239:14.47]Do it again.
[239:14.77]Alright, I got my Estus.
[239:17.91]Who cares about a thousand souls?
[239:19.03]It's fine.
[239:27.06]Can you do a spill joke where I'm going to spill the wine on my carpet?
[239:30.62]And lose my security deposit?
[239:33.76]That sounds like a good idea.
[239:35.22]It'd be, like, funny, right?
[239:35.94]Okay.
[239:43.48]Bingo, okay.
[239:48.80]Six flasks.
[239:50.14]Good, good, good, good.
[239:51.81]Now I'm ready.
[239:54.87]I'm ready to fight... the Crystal... Whatever the Crystal Knight's name is, who cares.
[240:09.84]When it's fun mod time, I mean, I am having fun.
[240:12.69]This is fun mod time.
[240:20.01]Let's go.
[240:31.41]Don't block my path.
[240:39.32]I have to at least get to the Watchers.
[240:44.22]I mean, Crystal Sage is right here.
[240:45.44]Watchers are right after it.
[240:47.89]Like two or three hours after.
[240:50.15]You know?
[240:50.85]Like four hours after where you were at right now.
[240:52.83]And it's alright.
[240:53.19]I'm gonna first try this right now.
[240:54.41]I've got an upgraded weapon.
[240:55.33]Did somebody get in here with me?
[240:56.83]No, it was my hand.
[240:58.23]It's my third fucking hand.
[241:01.00]What?
[241:01.94]I'm so confused.
[241:16.10]See, what happened there is the purple... ...firework... ...was out of my field of view.
[241:25.80]It was behind me, and what it did is it came back and hit me right in the back of the head.
[241:31.62]Couldn't see it.
[241:32.12]Because I'm in first person.
[241:39.39]On top of that... ...free hand.
[241:44.21]Don't explain it away.
[241:45.41]I have to... Don't you understand?
[241:46.69]I have to ultra-explain things three times in a row, over and over again.
[241:52.60]See, what happened was, a few minutes ago, what I did was I... The first person came up was behind... The thing was behind me, so... I have to explain the thing I just did four times.
[242:03.51]Welcome to Jerma985's livestream. ...
[242:15.13]See, like right now, that thing, I knew it.
[242:16.93]I told you it was gonna happen.
[242:18.63]I already explained the thing.
[242:31.14]Zero plus zero is zero.
[242:40.37]You gotta be fucking kidding me, bro.
[242:48.94]Remember when I died to Crystal Sage like 15 times in my first playthrough?
[242:55.00]Yeah, I'll beat Champion Gundyr first try, but I can't beat Crystal Sage.
[243:14.49]That's what I get for using a turd weapon.
[243:18.39]But there was a reason for the turret weapon.
[243:47.39]That's not the real one?
[243:48.37]Where?
[243:48.75]Oh my god.
[243:55.34]Those floating gobstoppers are the reasons that cause so many problems because I can't see them right now.
[244:01.18]It's behind me, isn't it?
[244:03.04]Oh, it's behind me!
[244:03.88]It's behind me!
[244:24.07]I'll take this one.
[244:25.69]Get the one behind me!
[244:26.61]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
[244:57.63]All the way over there.
[244:58.39]You've got to be kidding me.
[245:07.45]Who said I couldn't fucking do it second try?
[245:26.67]Now that was first try with actually upgraded weapon.
[245:32.49]I was here.
[245:32.99]I was here.
[245:33.37]Yeah, I mean, some of you were here for this.
[245:35.37]I need some more endurance.
[245:55.72]Yeah.
[245:56.52]I can do... I need to get to 20 Endurance.
[246:00.12]Just have to.
[246:02.15]Alright, what does the Crystal Sage's, uh... body orb do?
[246:13.76]Really?
[246:14.20]Oh.
[246:14.82]My god.
[246:26.34]It is the Soul of a Crystal Sage.
[246:27.89]It scales with magic.
[246:31.29]Just ain't gonna happen.
[246:40.97]Pop it.
[246:47.24]Let's get that Endurance up.
[246:51.00]For the Watchers, which I'm gonna first try.
[246:59.91]Hey chat, my bunny says she loves you all.
[247:09.63]That's so sweet.
[247:10.81]It really is.
[247:14.22]Little bunny.
[247:14.70]Well, tell your bunny that we all said hello.
[247:24.10]And look, if I just keep having fun in first person, then...
[247:30.19]Fuck it, man.
[247:30.67]Next time we- I'll do it again.
[247:31.87]We'll just do this again.
[247:33.50]I'm having an actual blast.
[247:46.30]He sounds drunk!
[247:51.45]I- I haven't- I'm on one glass of wine.
[247:56.29]I've taken in the amount of alcohol.
[247:59.00]that you get by swishing fucking Listerine in your mouth.
[248:05.77]What?
[248:13.49]Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.
[248:15.77]I have an accent.
[248:18.29]Alcohol.
[248:19.85]Alright, next person makes fun of my accent, I want them permanently 100% IP banned from my computer.
[248:31.83]What?
[249:00.15]Did I say coffee car?
[249:02.01]Coffee car.
[249:04.17]Coffee car.
[249:08.65]Where's my accent from?
[249:09.57]Uh, England.
[249:14.90]I was born in England, I was raised in England, and then I moved to New York, and then I moved from New York to Boston.
[249:21.60]I've since dropped my English accent.
[249:23.20]It comes out a little bit sometimes, but I've since dropped it.
[249:26.77]And it's weird because when you're around a certain group of people, you take on certain parts of their accents.
[249:35.57]So when I went to Boston, I had an English accent for a long time, but I started to get a Boston accent because I was hanging out with people from Massachusetts.
[250:03.18]I think it's time to get the shield out of here.
[250:08.34]It's just weighing me down.
[250:12.02]What's my equipment load?
[250:14.04]It's 25 out of 55.
[250:17.30]Am I technically... I don't even know what kind of roll I'm doing right now.
[250:21.33]Am I mid-rolling?
[250:22.13]Yeah, I am.
[250:28.44]I gotta get this done.
[250:29.14]2, let's see... 23, gotta be lower than that.
[250:45.21]Am I?
[250:47.27]Maybe not.
[250:56.07]Hard to tell.
[250:58.44]Fast roll isn't worth it.
[250:59.29]Actually, I love fast roll.
[251:03.07]Can I not get hit by you for the first time all stream?
[251:14.13]Of course not, because I was speaking.
[251:16.68]That was risky, but it was worth it.
[251:30.97]Let's get to those watchers.
[251:34.49]I'm getting double hits in the fire here.
[251:39.40]That's good.
[251:53.75]Don't tell him, chat.
[251:57.07]What is there to tell me that I don't already know?
[251:59.79]I've beat this game before.
[252:06.11]Alright, this is not the right way to go to Washington.
[252:10.31]Yeah, that's right.
[252:10.93]That's true.
[252:18.60]Does anyone want to play Super Smash?
[252:21.37]Dude, where's the friend code?
[252:41.62]Come here.
[252:41.98]Don't disappear.
[252:42.56]I just... There remains duck hunt?
[252:55.59]I don't.
[252:55.89]I don't even know what that is.
[253:06.55]So I refresh my memory.
[253:08.44]I don't care if this backseats.
[253:09.84]I've beaten this game probably ten times.
[253:12.04]How do I get to Watchers?
[253:13.32]It's from the swamp.
[253:37.41]Oh, that's right, right, right.
[253:38.15]You go through back here.
[253:39.59]Right.
[253:41.64]You go through Faron.
[253:44.18]Yeah, I remember.
[253:44.74]Alright, let's get it.
[253:48.16]Can some of you chatter to me, quick favor?
[253:52.36]Can we get a couple of let's get it in the chat?
[253:55.72]What the fuck was that?
[253:58.24]You hear that?
[254:10.45]You didn't just hear that, like... There's a NPC over here somewhere.
[254:17.86]There's also an Ember.
[254:19.72]And a Black Knight, right?
[254:21.06]From what I can't really remember.
[254:26.62]Your dad says I'm a bad influence.
[254:30.46]Well, I'm not... My goal here is not to influence him.
[254:37.74]Influencing anyone?
[254:38.78]Why would I... I don't want to influence you.
[254:49.23]Okay, there's a couple of items that I don't want to miss.
[255:00.89]He's a professional influencer.
[255:09.21]Alright, I want to go... where's the... Where's that NPC?
[255:14.39]He's up top.
[255:15.07]So I can kill him.
[255:19.06]And take his soul.
[255:23.38]Somebody's behind me, and I'm stuck.
[255:24.86]No!
[255:27.20]No!
[255:33.63]Where the fuck is this guy?
[255:34.59]I know he's over... no, maybe he's in Farron, I think.
[255:45.93]We're back out here anyways.
[255:48.01]I missed the item.
[255:48.85]Whatever.
[255:53.11]My first playthrough, I remember trying to jump up here over and over again.
[255:56.65]Ooh.
[255:57.49]Have I ever seen this item?
[256:07.84]This thing sucks.
[256:13.82]What does this have?
[256:14.66]This thing's terrible.
[256:23.17]Stabil- it has a high stability.
[256:30.28]It's a parry shield.
[256:31.04]Well, why wouldn't you just use a leather shield?
[256:40.30]Alright, this looks like a cookie.
[256:47.21]This is like a fucking 4th of July cookie.
[256:48.99]I don't think- I'm not using this thing.
[256:56.51]Alright, here we go.
[256:57.05]I know there are two NPCs to fight over here.
[257:01.90]Fucking Dengus and Dungus.
[257:03.04]There's Dungus.
[257:13.95]And Dengus is right behind him.
[257:25.95]I don't know what the fuck I was thinking there.
[257:27.17]I'm gonna get killed by Dengus and Dungus.
[257:29.19]This is great.
[257:30.25]Great.
[257:30.62]Great!
[257:34.44]Oh, fuck it.
[257:35.68]Who cares?
[257:36.50]I don't want anything to have anyways.
[257:37.62]Just get the bonfire.
[257:38.40]It's right in here.
[257:43.77]No!
[258:05.70]What did you think would happen?
[258:06.70]I just forgot how far the fall was.
[258:08.40]I thought it was like only a couple... I thought it was like 10 feet, 20 feet.
[258:12.79]I didn't think it was that far.
[258:14.29]Darth Vader's screamer.
[258:29.14]Nice fall joke.
[258:29.92]Jesus Christ, just stop dicking around and try to win it.
[258:33.42]Stop it!
[258:35.70]You be quiet.
[258:37.58]Yes.
[258:38.59]Yes.
[258:38.95]Be quiet.
[258:50.29]Well, I love, okay.
[258:51.27]I love how there's a bunch of Pluto's in chat.
[258:53.49]Everyone's like, oh my God.
[258:54.63]How come?
[258:56.99]Where's my Pluto?
[258:59.32]Get down the ladder.
[259:14.74]Does he actually come, he comes all the way down?
[259:38.35]Where is he going?
[259:44.61]Fucking dumbass.
[259:50.67]Oh, I can't wait.
[259:51.49]I'm gonna push you and watch you go all the way down.
[260:06.21]Okay.
[260:34.71]I got staggered to a point where I couldn't even dodge.
[260:37.89]I couldn't move.
[260:38.57]He hit me with the club.
[260:39.83]Whatever.
[260:45.30]Raging Boomer.
[260:46.18]I'm almost there.
[260:48.26]Hold on.
[260:48.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[260:48.84]Hold on.
[260:49.04]Wait, wait, wait.
[260:49.86]I'm trying to remember how this scenario plays out.
[260:51.92]I have to light the three towers before I can fight the Watchers, right?
[261:01.85]Oh, that sucks.
[261:03.19]That sucks.
[261:03.53]Thanks for watching the stream.
[261:13.91]What the hell is that?
[261:17.07]Why is it, why is this, why is Dingus's item there?
[261:19.15]How does it feel?
[261:40.73]I'm just going to run.
[261:42.63]I'm going to run and turn on the fires.
[261:47.23]I'm not going to fight any enemies.
[261:48.37]I don't care.
[261:48.85]I'm going to get the Abyss Watchers.
[261:54.60]I'm going to level up HP one more time.
[261:58.72]I'm going to equip the daggers and I'm just going to dash.
[262:01.84]I'm going to bring six Estus.
[262:04.14]No, no, no.
[262:04.56]I'm going to allocate Estus.
[262:13.49]Check this out.
[262:19.90]Yeah.
[262:25.02]Allocate Estus.
[262:33.00]You get where I'm going out here?
[262:41.04]Uh, there they are.
[262:42.16]Quick step.
[262:43.42]Because then when these are equipped... You don't need mana to quick step?
[263:01.41]Yeah, dude, look.
[263:06.85]You can dash without mana.
[263:07.71]What are you talking about?
[263:08.81]Huh.
[263:12.42]What?
[263:24.60]Oh.
[263:28.36]Am I gonna get banned?
[263:29.84]That seems like an exploit.
[263:30.90]Okay.
[263:39.75]So.
[263:40.43]You know the drill.
[263:41.13]You know the deal.
[263:42.30]We're going to upgrade our HP.
[263:55.95]You don't get iframes.
[263:56.73]I'm not looking for iframes.
[263:57.63]I'm just looking for traveling.
[264:01.03]I just... I don't care about items.
[264:02.65]I just want to light the three fires.
[264:07.25]If he does not first try this, I'm going to go to McDonald's and I'm going to do a McDonald's joke.
[264:10.50]Don't do that.
[264:15.12]The whole point of that is you wouldn't do that.
[264:18.30]Alright.
[264:18.66]Fire number one.
[264:19.68]Over there.
[264:20.30]Let's go.

[265:02.30]Oh, yikes!
[265:20.84]Oh, don't- just stop trying to be fucking funny and do things that you wouldn't do.

[265:57.10]The great sword.
[266:07.61]I ain't fucking around here.
[266:11.37]But I can get one item.
[266:42.28]Running is faster.
[266:44.40]Watch out for the slugs.
[266:46.10]Estus Shard.
[266:46.78]You didn't think I was gonna get the Estus Shard?
[266:48.84]You don't think I've ever played this game?
[267:01.70]Get it.

[268:02.54]No, somebody, Ghostbusters, holy shit, wow, nice job.
[268:08.31]Wow, you guys are smarter than your average bear.
[268:17.11]Alright, so this next one is straight, just straight, straight, straight, straight.
[268:25.62]This guy made fun of Fortnite?
[268:28.08]When did I make fun of Fortnite?
[268:37.06]Did I make fun of... Wait, no, I'm not, I'm trying to remember what...
[268:57.63]What?
[268:58.77]That's not a backstab.
[269:11.00]It's a backstab in every other pumpkin game I've ever played.
[269:33.53]Where's the last fire?
[269:38.01]Ah!
[269:41.92]That's not a backstab!
[269:43.12]Somebody tell me why!
[270:03.22]Cracked... Cracked peppercorn.
[270:07.51]It's up there, right?
[270:09.09]I lost it.
[270:16.19]It is up there, isn't it?
[270:22.69]I get a better view.
[270:25.78]He's in one of his moods?
[270:28.44]Yeah, the mood is, I have to get to the Abyss Watchers.
[270:32.65]It's not this.
[270:33.14]It's over there.
[270:39.26]Are you going to beat Medeir in first person?
[270:43.58]I don't think I'm going to get to Medeir in first person.
[270:45.65]I hate to, uh... I hate to say it.
[270:50.49]Alright, last one, and then door opens and we get to Abyss Watchers and I can beat them first try.
[271:04.59]Fuck the item, I'll get it later.
[271:05.59]Trevor, can you Venmo me $420?
[271:10.79]Uh, I don't.
[271:11.11]I don't have that.
[271:14.99]I don't have that money.
[271:32.98]Cheapskate, asshole!
[271:44.94]Alright, here we go.
[271:46.29]You guys ready?
[271:55.75]Ready for the Abyss Watchers?
[271:58.18]I am.
[272:00.79]And I'll prove it to you.
[272:01.59]Wait, I gotta do something cool here.
[272:04.35]I'm gonna go in a different door.
[272:07.75]It'll be something cool.
[272:10.49]Watch this!
[272:12.27]Come on, do it before I get killed.
[272:14.70]I mean, I didn't get it, but... I'm just trying to get the spin.
[272:18.42]Just give me the item.
[272:26.15]That is a bone shard.
[272:28.21]Very important to have it.
[272:29.57]And in fact, I'm going to go use it right now because it's important.
[272:41.40]Some people are saying die to slugs, but that didn't happen.
[272:45.38]I did not die to slugs.
[272:46.56]Because I'm still alive.
[273:00.18]This weapon sucks total asshole.
[273:03.22]And it's going to be the reason why I can't beat Abyss Watchers first try, but I'm going to beat them first try.
[273:12.03]I need... What do I need?
[273:20.47]I don't have enough.
[273:27.82]Died to one Tinwheel, two Dingus, three Slugs, four Abyss Watchers.
[273:32.49]That hasn't happened yet.
[273:33.95]We're in the Bone Shard.
[273:57.90]Alright.
[274:03.26]This is the streamer that's over-leveled and under-skilled.
[274:10.56]You can't die to a bonfire.
[274:16.20]What level am I?
[274:17.81]30?
[274:19.37]And I'm probably under-leveled right now because I'm skipping all this content.
[274:22.73]Level 30 for Abyss Watchers.
[274:24.15]That's under.
[274:33.60]Yeah.
[274:34.40]Don't tell me I'm underleveled when I'm... I mean, don't tell me I'm overleveled when I'm underleveled.
[274:39.97]You're making me look bad.
[274:40.91]Oops.
[275:05.01]Where the fuck am I going?
[275:06.28]I... I'm telling... The Piss Watchers are not over here.
[275:20.72]What is this?
[275:21.26]A golden scroll?
[275:23.98]I'm so close to being fucking petrified.
[275:59.49]I didn't even go the right way.
[276:00.43]How did I go the wrong way?
[276:10.22]Good thing this is not Dark Souls 1.
[276:14.04]Does a first person mod exist for Dark Souls 1?
[276:19.90]That would be very hard.
[276:22.90]I can't imagine playing that game on first person.
[276:27.48]One of these guys dropped a nice weapon though, didn't they?
[276:32.92]From what I remember.
[276:33.62]I think it's a little further up.
[276:52.68]Okay, if you could just get out of my screen for one second.
[276:58.27]All I see are fucking feathers flying around, and hands.
[277:26.69]He's died once to every enemy?
[277:28.09]That's not true.
[277:32.72]That actually might be true.
[277:34.08]Is that actually true?
[277:34.76]Oh, never mind.
[277:44.89]I'm just gonna go.
[277:57.42]I don't remember this part.
[277:58.48]I thought it was... No, it's right here.
[278:02.10]Right?
[278:02.30]Okay, hold on.
[278:06.68]There's some other shit in here, isn't there?
[278:07.82]Yeah, there's a bonfire in here.
[278:13.36]Fuck, I'm hungry, but I had dinner three hours ago.
[278:15.09]That's alright, just eat again.
[278:24.55]There's a Black Knight over here, isn't there?
[278:27.03]Who cares?
[278:31.17]What's wrong with that?
[278:31.67]That's alright.
[278:34.45]Just don't... Just have, like, a snack.
[278:36.15]Have a little snack.
[278:38.25]Popcorn.
[278:38.81]A little bit of butter on it.
[278:43.29]Cheese and crackers.
[278:45.51]That's a high calorie.
[278:47.07]You're fine.
[278:47.85]Yeah, these guys drop a poker sword.
[278:53.45]Well, I can't even...
[278:56.05]Forget it.
[278:56.39]Let's just go to the Watchers and win first track.
[279:15.79]This looks cool in first person.
[279:17.01]Look at this area.
[279:17.51]Alright, here we go.
[279:21.59]Let's give it a whirl.
[279:30.60]there we go that wasn't fair
[280:03.06]Now fight each other.
[280:05.86]Or don't.
[280:06.32]Fight me instead.
[280:08.83]Why are you not fighting each other?
[280:09.87]Fight him!
[280:11.59]You're making this too hard for me.
[280:18.99]Will you fight him?
[280:22.87]Oh, this is my friend over here.
[280:23.87]Right.
[280:24.13]Okay.
[280:35.03]The distance judge is so hard.
[280:36.45]I don't even know which one is which now.
[280:39.58]The perspective has got me all fucked up.
[280:41.86]I don't even know who's the real one.
[280:52.88]This is definitely not gonna happen first try.
[280:54.38]It's impossible first try.
[281:00.67]I'm doing 97 damage a swing.
[281:05.14]Is this the worst weapon in the entire game?
[281:07.21]It could be.
[281:08.53]It's possible.
[281:22.98]You're the worst weapon in the game.
[281:29.32]I'm not even going to get into the second phase.
[281:37.88]Maybe I will.
[281:39.66]Well, didn't see you there.
[281:41.16]Tunnel vision.
[281:59.44]Jerma, don't spoil what happened.
[282:05.09]It's the third worst halberd, but it has a good sweet spot.
[282:18.64]I'm so concerned about this.
[282:21.59]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[282:22.67]You guys don't understand.
[282:23.97]I didn't have a weapon with big reach, because depth perception is hard with the first person.
[282:29.31]So I had to use the Lucerne.
[282:43.10]This thing.
[282:43.50]I can't even.
[282:45.32]I'm literally gonna burn this weapon in the trash.
[282:48.96]It takes too long to swing.
[282:50.76]For a hundred and ten damage.
[282:52.02]It's awful.
[282:55.30]Just kill me.
[282:56.24]I'm gonna fucking burn this on screen.
[283:14.01]Where's the cool ice sword?
[283:44.67]I told you longsword was the way to go.
[283:46.79]Ice sword is the way to go.
[283:57.13]Check this out.
[283:58.59]Here we go.
[284:24.49]It's the camera man, it just is.
[284:26.99]They move too fast for me to hold right stick in a direction.
[284:39.40]You can't walk onto anybody.
[284:41.34]So I have to hold right stick to see where he is.
[284:53.14]Holy shit, I don't even know what's happening right now.
[284:54.90]I'm going to do it.
[284:59.29]I'm going to win.
[285:04.37]Jesus Christ.
[285:15.82]He spoiled with lock on.
[285:20.16]That was fucking insane.
[285:29.95]If the lock-on stayed locked on, right?
[285:32.91]So when you dodge roll, right?
[285:34.01]When you dodge roll in Dark Souls and you have a lock-on, the camera just is always focusing on the enemy that you have locked on.
[285:42.41]Not here.
[285:47.37]See here, if you do a dodge roll, the enemy is gone.
[285:51.98]Good luck.
[286:00.07]Turning the sensitivity up?
[286:01.01]No, that would be horrible.
[286:01.65]Because it would be like... I would throw up.
[286:04.97]I think it's... The sensitivity is fine.
[286:07.49]I'll get it.
[286:22.36]It's going to be slow and wait for the opportunity.
[286:24.40]And it's happening.
[286:34.67]I was just judging the distance.
[286:40.29]It's like juggling oranges while playing Dark Souls.
[286:57.49]Hmm.
[287:10.17]Fine, we're going to go with the fucking cookie shield.
[287:15.75]Because this will make me want to win.
[287:30.22]How many bosses have I beaten in first person?
[287:31.72]I've only played the game in first person.
[287:34.18]Only.
[287:35.34]So the whole game so far.
[287:42.34]I'm just gonna do some testing.
[287:48.71]I gotta do some testing first.
[287:52.97]Yipe.
[288:11.74]Oh, where did you come from?
[288:13.78]No!
[288:22.92]Ow!
[288:37.81]I'm too far away!
[288:51.19]Where the fuck did he go?
[288:52.57]Oh my god.
[289:04.40]This is gonna take like a hundred tries to do this.
[289:09.90]I need to upgrade this thing.
[289:15.43]I will do this before the stream is over.
[289:26.25]Oh my goodness.
[289:34.52]No, why am I locked onto that guy?
[289:36.36]What the hell is that for?
[289:45.24]Holy shit.
[289:49.68]Where the... I'm getting attacked from behind now.
[289:52.26]Come on!
[289:53.28]Come on, first person!
[289:54.64]Suck my bum!
[290:08.24]Get out of the way!
[290:09.46]Move!
[290:24.47]Turn.
[290:26.25]I might get him to the second phase.
[290:29.25]It's very possible.
[290:34.48]Oh my god!
[290:39.00]Just give me the second phase, and let me just see what it looks like in first person.
[290:41.54]I just want to see.
[290:42.50]I just want to see.
[290:48.27]I just, okay, I just want to see what it looks like.
[290:57.82]Here we go.
[290:59.24]I can't get hit one time.
[291:07.36]Holy shit.
[291:08.48]Trying to gauge the distance of these moves.
[291:12.90]No way.
[291:16.64]Not in a million years.
[291:17.75]It's not over.
[291:29.61]Suck my bum!
[291:31.19]Not you guys.
[291:34.72]I'm not throwing the towel in that easily.
[291:47.29]How do I fix this?
[291:47.95]I don't even have enough souls to do this.
[291:53.03]What weapon do I have?
[291:56.83]It might have to be... No.
[292:10.05]Use mouse and keyboard?
[292:10.87]I'll show you what happens when you use mouse and keyboard.
[292:13.87]This.
[292:16.33]As you can see, this is not ideal at all.
[292:20.81]Although, it seems cool.
[292:22.75]For some reason, the mod cannot handle a mouse input like this, because it's changing the camera so rapidly that it's very headache-inducing.
[292:37.98]I could probably upgrade this weapon.
[292:39.28]Let me see.
[292:39.64]I don't have any souls, but I can sell some stuff.
[292:50.69]So this requires... I could upgrade this once.
[292:53.85]With a Titanite.
[292:54.45]Twinkling Titanite.
[293:01.34]Either that or... I need a few more Shards to get this to plus 3.
[293:18.98]I'll upgrade this once.
[293:20.24]Because this is a good... This is a good weapon just to have.
[293:28.62]Promises of other mods.
[293:29.96]I have to beat Abyss Watchers first.
[293:32.12]Before we do anything else.
[293:33.42]First person.
[293:36.20]Plus, the title of the stream is First Person Dark Souls 3, so... Okay, I'm gonna upgrade this once.
[293:56.09]How many souls do I need to do this?
[294:01.13]530.
[294:01.25]That's easy.
[294:09.40]Sell.
[294:11.28]Sell the stupid home.
[294:13.06]Home brood that he made.
[294:14.12]Sell these dumb alien beads, whatever they are.
[294:20.99]I could put one of these on too.
[294:22.19]Can I put fire and ice?
[294:23.43]I don't think I can.
[294:27.80]If that's enough, I got enough.
[294:29.66]So that would be 138 plus 26.
[294:37.86]Let's give it a go.
[294:45.41]One more level and it turns into a C for Strength scaling.
[295:02.27]I'm going to give this to the bird.
[295:05.13]Okay.
[295:06.97]Let's try it again.
[295:09.25]I'm ready.
[295:14.39]I'm going to win.
[295:15.43]It's going to happen.
[295:17.41]Just give me your energy.
[295:27.77]No, why not?
[295:31.04]Can I get this stupid shield off and put something else useful on?
[295:36.56]This thing is really good.
[295:39.06]Let me see, it's 100% block.
[295:39.98]I don't know, it might not be good though.
[295:51.97]What is that little guy?
[295:53.23]The energy guy?
[295:59.51]Is that Kirby?
[296:00.80]What character is that?
[296:10.75]Okay.
[296:11.91]Focus.
[296:13.75]Let's go.
[296:14.17]Upgraded the weapon.
[296:17.00]Here we are.
[296:28.95]Have I lost my mind, or is this doing less damage?
[296:33.37]Where'd he go?
[296:37.38]What?
[296:39.72]It's not my head.
[296:45.38]Fuck.
[296:48.40]It got worse.
[297:09.09]Alright, okay, come on.
[297:11.27]You and me, me and you, me and you, me and you, me and you, me and you, me and you.
[297:15.43]I didn't expect you to... Alright, alright, I'm gonna settle down.
[297:25.34]Did you change hands?
[297:36.96]The smoke is just smoking me out here.
[297:39.40]There we go.
[297:56.57]Alright, get back here.
[298:01.96]Where is it?
[298:02.30]Where's the other guy?
[298:02.92]Where is he?
[298:03.32]Is he dead?
[298:04.60]No, he's up here.
[298:11.00]Let's do it.
[298:11.62]Florestus.
[298:12.48]Come on.
[298:15.83]Let's do it.
[298:17.09]I'm ready.
[298:23.15]How far do I have?
[298:29.59]I gotta gauge some distance here.
[298:31.98]Because he does the fire thing.
[298:42.69]Holy shit.
[298:51.10]Wow!
[298:59.09]It's so hard.
[299:00.59]It's so hard.
[299:01.71]It is so hard to do this in first person.
[299:10.34]It's so hard.
[299:24.25]I want my energy back now.
[299:25.37]It's mine.
[299:26.53]It's mine.
[299:27.15]I got to the first... I'm getting better.
[299:32.26]I'm doing things better.
[299:33.00]Everything's just fine.
[299:59.18]Holy shit.
[300:02.38]Fucking first person.
[300:13.37]I've ruined the character build too.
[300:15.49]It's all my own fault.
[300:18.49]I would be doing probably twice as much damage if I didn't put three upgrades.
[300:26.10]into the fucking wood long pole thing.
[301:14.74]Here comes the other guy.
[301:15.34]I can run.
[301:16.36]I don't even know who's the right one.
[301:27.27]It's not him.
[301:27.71]Alright, fight each other while I heal.
[301:37.32]I could just raw gem the loser.
[301:38.94]No, you're right.
[301:51.30]No, they're behind me.
[301:58.04]I will tell you, having to press R3 every five seconds is like mind-meltingly frustrating.
[302:06.89]Ugh.
[302:29.37]No!
[302:38.56]Come on.
[302:39.96]They're right next to me, aren't they?
[302:42.16]Gah!
[303:02.32]See, here's the thing.
[303:04.30]Everyone's saying do a new mod.
[303:07.86]We're at the ultimate wall.
[303:09.14]I have to beat this first.
[303:10.26]You want me to do this in x10 speed?
[303:13.79]That's not gonna happen.
[303:15.89]There's no way.
[303:22.55]Okay, let me... What would I get if I raw gemmed the Lucian?
[303:36.50]Turn them all on at the same time.
[303:40.06]I can do this.
[303:41.02]I just need to get the right amount of damage.
[303:48.32]136 plus 62.
[303:49.10]202.
[303:49.16]Okay.
[303:50.06]I'm going to raw gem this.
[304:02.39]I'm going to raw gem the Lucerne.
[304:05.01]We're going to give it a go.
[304:08.25]We're going back to turd.
[304:10.58]I need 2250 souls.
[304:11.24]We're just selling my whole inventory.
[304:19.12]What the hell is even in here?
[304:19.92]That doesn't matter.
[304:29.00]Doesn't matter.
[304:38.08]Where is it?
[304:39.70]What am I at right now?
[304:43.35]151 plus 39.
[304:44.65]This would make this a 202.
[304:47.49]That's as good as I'm going to get.
[304:50.88]Doing it.
[304:52.88]Let's go.
[304:53.16]Now I'm going to win.
[305:19.23]Plus 3 damage.
[305:22.20]What do I got?
[305:22.90]22 of my... How's my roll?
[305:26.10]Alright, let's go.
[305:29.06]And... What else do we got here?
[305:31.88]Can I put... Can I use this shit?
[305:34.75]Does this actually work?
[305:35.53]I can actually light this on fire.
[305:38.29]I'll be ready.
[305:43.33]No, not that one.
[305:43.93]Where is it?
[305:44.75]I don't think I have any gold pine.
[305:50.24]Nah, I don't have any gold pine.
[305:58.29]You just copied their weapons.
[305:59.39]Well, sometimes you have to copy to win.
[306:05.23]24 hour stream?
[306:05.79]I don't think so.
[306:06.74]But, I'm still having a good time, so.
[306:09.78]Gonna keep going.
[306:40.66]Here he comes.
[306:41.10]I'm gonna bolt.
[306:51.26]Holy shit, that guy almost killed me in one hit.
[306:54.06]It doesn't help that I'm under-leveled too.
[306:59.59]I'm like under-leveled by like probably at least five to ten levels for this.
[307:14.86]Wrong guy.
[307:15.18]Alright, if I don't do it this time, then I'm gonna... I'll turn... Because this is just... This is just literal pain.
[307:24.90]Underleveled first-person mod.
[307:26.74]I may as well just fucking... I honestly may as well just go to sleep on screen.
[307:44.02]I don't think there's a place in the right direction.
[307:53.97]Awww.
[307:57.65]Looking for the backswing.
[308:06.13]You're stuck in, like, the fog!
[308:16.35]Where is he?
[308:16.69]Where is he?
[308:16.95]Where is he?
[308:17.27]Where is he?
[308:17.71]Where is he?
[308:19.81]Ooh!
[308:21.29]Okay, I got an opportunity here.
[308:23.49]One shot.
[308:27.83]Let's go.
[308:43.64]Okay.
[309:09.05]That fucking camera, what are you doing to me?
[309:15.21]Mmm!
[309:18.41]Mmm!
[309:47.60]No, the camera is off him again!
[309:49.50]It's so frustrating!
[309:52.28]I just want to lock onto him and it just takes it off every fucking time!
[309:58.66]Oh my god, it's unbearable!
[310:11.83]Because every time I turn the camera, it faces the direction you move, right?
[310:16.88]So if I have him locked on and I dodge this way, he's gone.
[310:20.84]Even if I'm locked on.
[310:21.58]Ooh, it hurts.
[310:32.72]No, I got him close.
[310:33.46]I can do this.
[310:41.83]Take it out of first person?
[310:43.64]That defeats the whole purpose of this whole stream.
[311:17.68]Summon ghosts.
[311:19.20]No, I can't do that.
[311:20.56]I got him halfway.
[311:21.99]I'll get it.
[311:23.77]This is definitely the wall, though.
[311:28.20]I'm fucked.
[311:46.96]I have to at least beat this.
[311:51.19]How many times?
[311:51.63]I'm probably... I'll die another 30 times.
[311:53.39]I'm gonna do it.
[312:00.95]I'm gonna... I'm wearing the weights and I'm running the mile.
[312:14.54]Don't worry.
[312:14.80]We're gonna go to funny mods after I beat them.
[312:19.27]It has to happen.
[312:20.01]We're going to transition to funny LOL mods.
[312:23.13]But I'm going to beat him right now.
[312:24.33]I didn't even know.
[312:55.26]I can't break out cheers to you yet.
[313:02.17]Cheers to you is a desperate scenario.
[313:03.95]I'm not desperate yet.
[313:05.68]Because I did bring him to about 50%.
[313:21.36]What the fuck is that?
[313:23.38]Let's get bit by a mosquito.
[313:24.74]Here we go.
[313:33.97]It's the lock on that's killing me.
[313:45.41]put the lock on on him and you just you've played hundreds of hours of Dark Souls and you just expect that when you dodge or you move it's gonna keep them in focus it just doesn't do it and the thousands of times you've died in Dark Souls it's not gonna happen don't not with that attitude
[314:21.00]Unplug the controller and do mouse and keyboard?
[314:28.10]I'll try it, but I'm so used to playing this game without a mouse.
[314:33.45]This is the one right here.
[314:34.35]I don't need a mouse, I don't need extra support.
[314:38.49]I'm gonna do this on my own, because I know that I can.
[314:42.14]You understand?
[314:43.40]One, two, three, action!
[314:58.57]Fair.
[314:59.19]That's not fair.
[315:00.27]I can't do it when it's not fair.
[315:08.46]You can't do it when it's unfair.
[315:09.84]You know?
[315:11.62]When you've got an unfair scenario.
[315:18.41]Oh my fucking Jesus Christ.
[315:21.49]I'm gonna do it.
[315:23.27]Ugh.
[315:30.61]You know, it's actually kind of refreshing.
[315:31.73]I'll tell you why.
[315:34.45]So, like, seven months ago, I opened up Dark Souls 3 for fun.
[315:38.69]And I was like, you know, I'll play through Dark Souls 3 again.
[315:40.39]That sounds like a good idea.
[315:43.39]I think I died probably three times.
[315:45.63]I beat the Abyss Wasp's first try.
[315:47.32]It was just like, alright, this is just what I'm doing.
[315:48.74]This is fun.
[315:49.80]I know how to, like, dodge here.
[315:52.16]It's actually kind of refreshing to lose over and over again in a game that I've played through at least five times.
[315:58.70]It's really cool.
[316:01.29]This actually is very interesting.
[316:08.25]It's refreshing.
[316:10.04]I'm like frustrated again at Abyss Watchers.
[316:12.00]When's the last time you heard that?
[316:26.14]There's the other guy.
[316:26.80]There he is.
[316:42.31]This really breeds new life.
[316:43.51]Okay, I'm just gonna run away.
[316:45.85]Are you just being really annoying?
[316:48.91]Alright, go in.
[316:56.73]You're fighting the wrong guy.
[316:59.23]You're supposed to fight your brothers!
[317:09.51]What the hell just happened?
[317:20.18]Really?
[317:20.56]I thought you were further away.
[317:23.52]This is a bad angle.
[317:25.57]Very bad angle.
[317:27.33]Where's the other one?
[317:44.37]The distance, man.
[317:45.12]It's gonna kill me every time.
[318:12.75]Alright, come on.
[318:13.21]Bring it on.
[318:13.60]Let's go.
[318:13.94]Go.
[318:14.10]Fight him.
[318:14.32]Fight him.
[318:14.54]Fight him.
[318:15.26]Hit him.
[318:15.76]Hit him again.
[318:16.14]Hit him again.
[318:17.66]Good.
[318:18.08]Let's go.
[318:18.40]Glass of wine.
[318:23.80]Come on.
[318:34.89]Be gentle.
[318:35.43]Be easy.
[318:36.01]It's going to take a little while, but you'll get it.
[318:41.04]It's okay, all I need is one.
[318:44.34]The effects are on the screen.
[318:47.58]Good luck.
[318:57.55]Jesus, man.
[319:07.02]Where the fuck did he go?
[319:08.36]You just saw him real time there.
[319:09.62]I didn't even get to do anything.
[319:11.86]You saw in real time how impossible that is.
[319:40.79]It's desperate.
[319:48.23]What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.
[319:56.79]Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons.
[320:00.25]I can do this.
[320:02.09]If there's a situation that does not apply to you, just listen and see how you feel.
[320:12.01]So sit back, get ready.
[320:16.51]Here it comes.
[320:19.29]I can only use this once every couple of years because I absolutely guaranteed we'll win.
[320:24.13]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[320:32.35]You're the one who steps up and gets things done around here.
[320:39.22]You keep your word, you deliver what you promise, and then you go the extra mile.
[320:49.05]You're doing a great job!
[320:51.45]A great job!
[320:59.84]If anyone asks, we'll tell them.
[321:03.32]A great job!
[321:38.80]Come on, cheer me on!
[321:39.88]Cheer me on!
[321:40.38]I can't do it without you!
[321:47.38]Where is he?
[321:49.18]I need him right now so bad!
[321:50.72]You're probably wondering why we have asked you here today.
[322:09.12]We want to tell you that we have faith in you.
[322:12.26]And we know you can do it.
[322:17.82]We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your heart desires.
[322:25.96]That dream you're going for.
[322:27.88]That career you want.
[322:29.82]That recognition you're seeking.
[322:32.88]It is yours!
[322:38.19]Just listen, everyone agrees.
[322:45.10]They're on your side.
[322:46.78]Who's on my side?
[322:47.42]We're here for you.
[322:48.54]Who is?
[322:49.34]We believe in you.
[322:53.68]We believe in you.
[323:08.63]It's impossible.
[323:10.89]It's actually impossible.
[323:31.06]Nah, unplugging doesn't help either.
[323:35.82]It's still like this fucked up.
[323:47.88]It's just like putting, it's just covering your eyes in paint.
[323:53.05]You wanna play the game Dark Souls?
[323:54.27]Yeah, dude, sounds like fun.
[323:55.63]First, cover your eyes in green paint.
[324:11.66]Thank you.
[324:12.78]Thank you for believing in me.
[324:15.28]Thank you for a million things.
[324:16.70]Seriously, thank you for believing in me.
[324:17.92]I'm gonna go for it.
[324:18.52]For your love and your support.
[324:21.14]And your persistence and your patience and your courage.
[324:24.21]This is very real right now.
[324:25.39]When life was the craziest.
[324:27.83]When I didn't have a clue who I was.
[324:30.35]When I kept going down the wrong road.
[324:33.55]You were always there, seeing something in me that I just couldn't see.
[324:38.93]And you never gave up hope.
[324:40.83]You never said, good luck, you're on your own.
[324:42.99]You never walked away.
[324:44.17]You've never done that, guys.
[324:45.31]You stood nearby.
[324:46.09]And you prayed your prayers.
[324:48.73]And you knew the truth.
[324:50.47]And it worked.
[324:57.56]I wouldn't be who I am today if it were not for you.
[325:02.62]And together, we celebrate.
[325:16.24]We just weren't cheering hard enough last time.
[325:18.24]That was the problem.
[325:32.05]Come on, that's my friend!
[326:00.64]Where's the stagger?
[326:01.40]Come on, man.
[326:03.04]Listen.
[326:03.84]Listen up.
[326:06.66]All this is for you.
[326:11.18]It's kind of not healthy.
[326:13.30]We know you've been working really hard and sometimes you think it's never going to happen, but it is.
[326:18.08]It is.
[326:19.10]So don't give up.
[326:20.06]You're almost there.
[326:21.52]I'm almost there.
[326:22.26]You can have what you want.
[326:28.19]You can do it.
[326:29.39]Don't stop now.
[326:30.71]Just keep going.
[326:32.57]The finish line is closer than you think.
[326:35.69]We can see it.
[326:39.91]Hear that?
[326:41.81]It's your turn.
[326:42.45]Take it in.
[326:43.43]Take it in.
[326:48.99]It's your turn.
[326:50.46]It's my turn.
[326:52.42]My turn.
[327:06.35]It's my turn.
[327:32.31]I need my chairs.
[327:41.77]You're kind and you're compassionate.
[327:45.54]You give and you receive and you're grateful for what you have.
[327:51.04]To you, the glass is always more than half full.
[327:56.86]You're smart and you're creative and you're courageous.
[328:09.26]It's too much to handle.
[328:12.04]It's too much to do.
[328:16.22]God damn it.
[328:17.22]Not even cheers to you is going to make this happen.
[328:25.11]What level am I?
[328:26.31]Fucking 30.
[328:26.71]Alright.
[328:27.07]Hold on.
[328:42.71]I get to play binaural beats?
[328:45.69]Fuck, it's so hard.
[328:47.99]It's too much.
[328:48.89]It's so hard.
[328:50.08]What if I... I don't even... Like, you know what I mean?
[328:51.86]Like, fuck.
[328:53.42]But I'm so addicted right now to beating this boss in first person.
[328:57.98]Ugh.
[329:06.58]I can... I know I can do this.
[329:07.98]It's just...
[329:10.82]I feel like I'm one of those old school phone operators.
[329:13.84]Where there's like 40 calls going on.
[329:15.92]And I gotta unplug Mary talking to fucking Jacob.
[329:18.86]And plug her into talking to fucking Dan.
[329:20.94]And then Dan is trying to call fucking Margaret.
[329:23.50]Unplug Margaret.
[329:24.38]There's a lot of inputs.
[329:26.94]What the hell am I even doing right now?
[329:38.16]You have to dodge right?
[329:38.92]I can't dodge right.
[329:40.16]In any Souls game.
[329:41.18]It never worked.
[329:44.18]It doesn't matter how much better it'll be.
[329:45.94]I have to dodge left everywhere.
[329:47.32]I can't dodge right.
[329:47.96]This is engraved in my brain.
[329:55.03]Forward, forward.
[329:55.53]I can dodge forward.
[330:04.97]What do you got?
[330:05.63]Something?
[330:06.11]Souls?
[330:11.67]Why are you fighting this guy?
[330:12.43]Because I want to, like, level up again.
[330:16.97]And I even went to the desperation.
[330:18.37]I brought in the cheers to you.
[330:19.78]You know that.
[330:22.06]Like, this is a Frieza moment right now.
[330:31.99]The strongest thing in the universe is cheers to you.
[330:38.12]Am I the weapon?
[330:38.98]No, it's not.
[330:40.56]What have I done?
[330:41.42]What have I done?
[330:45.98]I can only bring out cheers to you, like, once every couple of years, and it works.
[330:50.54]Not this time.
[330:51.86]This is when the arc of the story, where the hero gets beat, and you thought he was gonna win?
[330:57.73]Like, nobody can beat Jerma985.
[330:59.77]Oh, yeah, no, yes, they can.
[331:01.61]He got beat.
[331:03.57]He was defeated.
[331:05.03]What are we gonna do?
[331:21.93]Now we're training for the revenge arc.
[331:23.65]That's true.
[331:24.15]It's because I've ran through this whole zone and I thought I was going to be able to beat him first try.
[331:35.40]What an idiotic thing to think.
[331:41.40]I mean, we're talking, like, how stupid was that for me to say, you know, I'm going to run through a whole zone and then fight the boss in first person.
[331:47.07]What an idiotic thing to say.
[332:06.69]Where am I?
[332:09.29]Oh, God.
[332:09.77]No, not these guys.
[332:10.57]Not these guys.
[332:11.25]No.
[332:17.65]Don't curse me.
[332:20.28]I'll take poison every day of the week.
[332:31.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[332:33.20]They're everywhere.
[332:37.39]I need a redemption arc.
[332:41.55]Get Abyss Watchers.
[332:43.29]Stuck on the Abyss Watchers.
[332:50.44]How much is one level?
[332:51.34]Like 2500? 3000?
[333:02.32]Jex is not... Okay, you guys ever see... Spoilers for Infinity War.
[333:07.46]Those of you that don't want to know about Thanos and his great rise to... You know.
[333:15.52]Remember in that movie when the Hulk... Right?
[333:18.82]Spoilers.
[333:19.32]Just turn your fucking entire house off.
[333:21.08]Remember in Infinity War... When the Hulk couldn't become the Hulk?
[333:31.63]Jax is not here.
[333:32.49]I can't get him.
[333:35.80]There is no Jax.
[333:37.18]He doesn't want to come out.
[333:45.66]We don't even have Jaune.
[333:49.46]We have... We have... I don't have any flasks.
[333:53.24]I'm not going to kill... I've been abandoned by my inner fucking Jax.
[334:08.42]Get me out of here.
[334:09.48]How are you still here?
[334:16.03]You fucking muppet.
[334:19.45]I didn't think he could even come up here.
[334:21.87]Oh no, it's over.
[334:27.40]Where am I?
[334:27.78]Where am I?
[334:49.50]I'm just trying to get some... I've done a bad thing here.
[335:00.59]I've fucked it all up.
[335:28.41]What?
[335:31.23]Butcher knife in my field.
[335:32.53]This whole thing is good.
[335:36.97]I wouldn't- didn't have that much trouble until right now.
[335:39.71]But that's because this is where the game actually begins to start to matter.
[335:44.31]It actually might not be a bad idea.
[335:53.60]To crystal lizard this shit and get the twinkling Titanite and upgrade the fucking other weapon.
[336:28.75]Holy shit, that was terrifying in first person.
[336:42.50]Which way do I do it?
[337:08.69]Easy, easy.
[337:32.63]No no no, no gamer fatigue!
[337:33.91]Don't let that set in!
[337:36.14]You can't let Gamer Fatigue set in right now, it just almost did.
[337:39.14]I could feel the energy draining from my fucking soul.
[337:55.50]Don't let any fucking fatigue fit in.
[338:04.99]That's not even the right thing I needed to do.
[338:31.58]Black Knight.
[338:32.70]Oh, my fucking chest.
[338:37.71]Oh, I didn't.
[338:38.59]Please don't.
[338:39.29]I'm in the middle of my fucking montage.
[338:49.73]Get away from me.
[338:50.79]You're in the way.
[338:58.96]You're in the way.
[338:59.40]You're in my way.
[339:11.75]What's going on?
[339:16.15]Die!
[339:24.50]I'm ready.
[339:27.10]No, that's not what I want.
[339:27.88]This.
[339:47.88]When is he doing this?
[340:06.53]Give me a Black Knight weapon.
[340:09.29]Game sucks.
[340:23.59]Shellsword.
[340:29.19]Parry the Watchers?
[340:30.35]It's... It's really hard to parry in first person.
[340:37.56]Oh, Shellsword, Twinblades.
[340:46.18]I just did it?
[340:46.78]Yeah, but that was because I... I just put a bunch of air into my brain.
[340:50.75]I just went and shoved a bunch of air into my brain.
[341:15.62]These are good, right?
[341:29.63]This feels like a VR game.
[341:37.96]I'm using them.
[341:44.54]Anything else?
[341:55.24]Alright, let's go back and level up.
[341:56.72]Decks.
[341:59.08]And these.
[342:12.02]We just had to train...
[342:21.35]Leveling dex?
[342:22.07]Well, desperate times call for desperate measures, and that's called... I gotta be... down.
[342:37.62]Do I even have any Titanite shards?
[342:52.28]I do.
[343:02.26]I have a little bit.
[343:02.84]Okay, so this is 108 plus 23.
[343:05.42]This goes from C to C. I'm doing it.
[343:08.47]I'm going for it.
[343:13.09]I need a few more.
[343:13.85]I can buy shards from somebody, right?
[343:15.65]Okay.
[343:25.15]Who sells them?
[343:32.26]Sell everything you have.
[343:33.12]Start from scratch.
[343:39.35]I'm in first person already.
[343:40.43]Don't need him.
[343:57.61]I need the ashes.
[343:58.79]Oh, right.
[343:59.45]But where is that first ash?
[344:11.97]Is it in the swamp?
[344:12.93]Shit.
[344:13.92]Alright, I'll be back.
[344:26.02]Alright, back here.
[344:32.68]There aren't any more mods, are there?
[344:35.04]They're right here.
[344:35.88]I just am so obsessed with this right now.
[344:46.13]He's a liar.
[344:46.81]There aren't actually any mods.
[344:50.53]No, it's in the poison swamp.
[344:55.83]I assure you, there are.
[344:56.73]And once I beat the Abyss Watchers...
[345:03.02]What?
[345:10.66]So, like, back here.
[345:22.85]If you beat the Watchers, I will... I don't care how long it takes.
[345:26.01]I will beat the Watchers.
[345:28.84]I don't care how long it takes.
[345:30.60]In first person.
[345:33.08]If this is the first ever 24-hour stream, that's what's going to happen.
[345:43.34]Alright, where the hell am I?
[345:45.74]Where's this ash?
[346:05.41]It's not even here, is it?
[346:06.33]This is where I just came from, isn't it?
[346:20.48]It's the tower in the swamp.
[346:25.21]That's the entrance!
[346:26.15]Where the fuck is the tower?
[346:36.55]It's opposite the abyss walkers.
[346:43.27]It's a huge foot west of that.
[346:44.71]I should have taken the other bonfire then.
[347:20.42]I thought it was going to be a Titanite charge.
[347:23.94]It's near that room full of slugs, so I should have gone to the other bot fight.
[347:32.73]You're back from dinner?
[347:33.33]What did you miss?
[347:33.85]Well, you missed a couple of rage moments.
[347:50.92]Alright, where the hell are you?
[347:53.02]Room with the slugs.
[347:54.46]Room with the slugs.
[347:59.10]What?
[348:00.68]This is the room with the slugs right here.
[348:05.90]Get away from me.
[348:07.32]De-aggro.
[348:09.79]De-aggro from me.
[348:10.77]I demand it.
[348:23.36]Good players can beat this game five times in the time you've played today.
[348:27.08]Um, but are they playing in first person?
[348:30.93]The heck are you talking about?
[348:32.05]I've made it to the other bonfire, which is probably where I should have started in the first place.
[348:54.49]Okay, so from here... I need to go... Not this way.
[349:08.86]Is this fun in first person?
[349:10.48]No.
[349:11.66]I'm just kidding.
[349:12.10]Yes, it is.
[349:13.36]To the right.
[349:13.78]Wait, wait, wait.
[349:14.56]Also, you've got to remember, when you tell me where to go, there's like at least a five to ten second delay on the stream.
[349:20.45]So when I walk and you say go right, I'm seeing that like ten seconds later.
[349:24.13]So you talk about like straight and right.
[349:35.18]Go left.
[349:41.34]Like there.
[349:51.95]Where's the entrance?
[350:01.97]Don't fucking poison me.
[350:07.51]Your other left.
[350:09.07]Where's the entrance?
[350:14.62]Oh, that's right.
[350:15.12]There is an Asylum Demon up here.
[350:21.87]It was there.
[350:23.53]First person camera.
[350:25.59]It's hard to see.
[350:26.43]I thought that was just a bamboo shoe.
[350:29.69]Oh.
[351:00.43]The wolf?
[351:01.21]I'm gonna stab him in his head.
[351:19.36]What the?
[351:19.78]How are you supposed to get that?
[351:20.82]I can't jump to there.
[351:21.74]How are you supposed to get that?
[351:23.90]What the?
[351:24.28]How?
[351:24.40]That doesn't make any sense.
[351:35.19]tuber fo- I mean, I can use- I can do the tuber voice.
[351:38.27]My damn will, please.
[351:47.88]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[351:48.60]This is the asylum demons up here.
[351:56.24]Let's kill this motherfucker, what do you say?
[352:01.79]I got my double swords.
[352:04.01]Let's go.
[352:04.33]The Asylum Demon's not that hard, although he'll probably die.
[352:06.75]Alright.
[352:08.27]I'm glad that he spits out meatballs.
[352:10.13]He's got a really slow swing.
[352:17.26]This is gonna take forever, isn't it?
[352:28.52]It won't be that long.
[352:34.34]I think I have to run when he does that.
[352:44.27]If I were to guess.
[352:44.81]Where am I?
[353:17.07]Don't die to the Pinwheel demon.
[353:18.91]You guys have to understand.
[353:20.05]My field of view is so limited.
[353:25.62]When I get that close, all I see are bird feathers.
[353:50.21]Increasing the FOV will pull it back to a point where it looks unnatural and it looks kind of strange.
[353:57.61]Almost like you're looking through somebody else's body.
[354:00.79]Not necessarily... Oh, it's in my hands!
[354:02.67]I can see my hands and I'm running.
[354:04.08]It's like the weird VR syndrome where my hands are floating like 10 feet in front of my face.
[354:25.41]I'm ready too, that's it.
[354:37.08]Lord.
[354:37.77]Oh, Sol's gone.
[354:55.79]Did I build the character wrong?
[354:57.47]Yeah.
[355:00.41]For a very quick explanation.
[355:02.77]Judging the distance is extraordinarily difficult in first person.
[355:08.00]So I thought very, very brilliantly that I was going to use a really long spear type weapon because it'd be easier to determine where I was.
[355:17.30]Super short, like, record scratch.
[355:20.02]That was a terrible idea because it don't even matter anyways.
[355:41.37]Happening in forum.
[355:43.37]Where's that wall?
[355:48.46]There's an illusory wall.
[355:49.56]I know there is.
[355:50.23]I didn't just read that in chat.
[356:15.44]No one tell him where.
[356:16.46]You better tell me!
[356:19.86]And there's the Ashe.
[356:38.10]LonelyStreamer reads in quotes chat.
[356:41.44]What do you mean in quotes?
[356:43.81]Why are you putting chat in quotes?
[356:48.58]There's a chat here.
[356:49.44]What?
[356:49.54]I have to at least beat another bot.
[356:57.81]I'm too addicted to first person.
[357:00.99]I told you.
[357:01.69]I'm telling you.
[357:02.57]I'm saying to you.
[357:03.87]Listen to me.
[357:04.85]Are you hearing me?
[357:08.06]Losing to the Asylum Demon.
[357:10.53]It's like I Eternal Sunshine'd my brain.
[357:12.35]It's great.
[357:12.83]This is awesome.
[357:14.93]I'm so glad that I'm losing over and over again.
[357:23.71]Wake up.
[357:24.07]I don't want to wake up.
[357:25.83]I'd rather stay asleep.
[357:28.80]How did that?
[357:29.80]I don't know.
[357:31.60]I don't know.
[357:33.26]You got a fucking scientist on it.
[357:38.82]Yeah, that's better.
[357:42.94]Walking on is a really awful idea.
[357:45.32]No, not that shit.
[358:00.80]Ugh.
[358:11.63]This hurts him a lot.
[358:18.66]Ay yi yi.
[358:24.64]It's okay to be gritty sometimes.
[358:41.94]Oh, shit.
[358:42.76]Just didn't see it.
[358:43.91]I don't know how far that's gonna go, but far enough, apparently.
[358:49.61]Don't you fucking even think about it.
[358:51.35]Give me a break.
[358:51.91]Get outta here.
[358:55.32]Shook.
[359:10.47]Eat the meatball.
[359:11.23]I did.
[359:12.11]Like three times.
[359:16.95]You've been laughing for just over six hours.
[359:18.01]By this point, it's considerably 24 ounces of water.
[359:26.48]I'm fine.
[359:28.64]I drank water on my break.
[359:29.54]I drank a whole entire 16-ounce glass.
[359:33.38]Any other items up here?
[359:34.16]I got the ash.
[359:36.36]I'm ready to continue the upgrade path.
[359:39.34]Oh, that's where you come in there.
[359:40.90]I remember the E3 joke.
[359:42.88]That seems like six years ago.
[359:44.24]That was three hours ago.
[359:48.56]He's reading bot messages.
[359:50.06]I... Well, I didn't... I... I'm just homeward boning.
[359:56.86]I don't care.
[360:13.78]Alright, what does the Asylum Demon have?
[360:18.40]His large Titanite over there?
[360:20.04]I'll get it later.
[360:22.76]Aha.
[360:26.91]Oh, fuck.
[360:28.55]You can get Havel's Ring.
[360:35.31]Oh.
[360:51.31]I want it.
[361:03.70]Oh shit, I don't have any more souls.
[361:10.90]I put on some real armor.
[361:13.89]What?
[361:14.49]After I enforce the flask.
[361:20.24]Seven, seven, seven, +2.
[361:23.72]Here you go.
[361:25.40]Take the ash.
[361:28.56]Tell her where you found... I think I give a shit.
[361:34.23]Alright, I'm ready to upgrade.
[361:37.17]Alright, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, +2.
[361:51.47]Your mods are gonna ban us, what?
[361:56.53]777 jackpot.
[362:01.75]Why is everybody writing 7s?
[362:02.53]Chat, stop giving him points, he's tricking you.
[362:25.92]I need souls because I need to upgrade my new cool weapon that I want to use not this dumb not cool weapon That's not the one it's these ones.
[362:34.05]Alright, I want to I want my cool weapon to be upgrade of a dumb one So I need how many souls do I need I Need 800
[362:50.50]I need, like, 5,000 souls.
[362:52.94]I just had it, but I got Havel's Ring.
[362:57.76]Because this is... Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[363:01.02]Okay.
[363:05.04]I need souls!
[363:11.86]Stop saying Havel.
[363:13.05]I have an accent.
[363:21.21]He doesn't have any mods.
[363:23.07]Do I need to activate one of these mods just to prove that I own them?
[363:29.68]I could sell the embers, but... Unnecessary.
[363:47.39]Sell all of them.
[363:49.05]No, I can get like a thousand right here.
[363:52.90]These guys alone... Alright.
[363:53.90]And then I'm gonna sell four embers.
[363:58.22]Who cares?
[364:28.63]I should be able to upgrade these twice to plus three.
[364:35.36]Install a nude mod?
[364:36.74]For who?
[364:43.62]I think I have enough to do it once.
[364:44.68]I do.
[364:46.87]Alright, so this is four to get it to +2.
[364:54.01]And then I need six to get it to plus three.
[365:03.83]You have, that's eight.
[365:05.53]Okay.
[365:05.87]So I need, I need like 7,000 souls.
[365:37.68]I don't have any, like, joke weapons.
[365:38.72]That's too much to sell.
[365:58.97]I don't want to sell, like, six embers.
[366:07.69]Just cheat?
[366:08.33]What do you mean, just cheat?
[366:23.12]I'm not gonna use this.
[366:24.58]I'm certain of it.
[366:25.98]What a waste.
[367:00.30]how many souls do I need to do this one more time I need I got it alright bingo plus three let's go it's time I got seven Estus flasks I got a new good weapon
[367:23.15]No, not the wolf.
[367:25.54]Who the hell is it?
[367:42.96]Which one is it?
[367:43.42]I don't even remember where the hell I need to go.
[367:46.42]It's this one, right?
[367:47.16]Yeah.
[367:50.06]Time for a redemption arc?
[367:52.44]We'll see.
[368:01.96]By the way, if you're wondering, I'm doing true glasses of wine.
[368:06.34]Which are not even 20% of the glasses full.
[368:10.86]So you heard me pour that three times.
[368:12.11]There's no three full glasses of wine.
[368:13.47]That's the kind of glass of wine you'll get at a restaurant.
[368:23.19]Prove it.
[368:23.49]I don't have to prove anything.
[368:27.29]Here we go.
[368:27.85]Let's try it again.
[368:30.90]And then we get to turn on the funny mods!
[368:33.72]At... 6 plus hours after the stream has been going.
[368:44.17]How much damage are we gonna do now? 58.
[369:17.17]Use L1?
[369:17.37]I am doing L1.
[369:18.29]I'm stuck in the corner and it's time to lose it.
[369:37.88]I can't even.
[369:38.66]Can't move.
[370:03.08]I only leveled up one time.
[370:15.68]New mods, new mods, new mods, you suck.
[370:21.38]If you guys knew... No, not if you guys, if some of you guys knew how hard it was to do this, maybe you'd be a little nicer.
[370:52.61]Maybe you wouldn't have such a mean streak.
[371:00.83]Oh, fuck.
[371:03.41]It's 120.
[371:03.99]It's actually not bad.
[371:06.49]Still probably could use, like, another 5-level.
[371:25.51]Bring him on, let's go.
[371:26.24]Where's my friend?
[372:13.11]It's just melting my brain how annoying that is
[372:38.02]Alright, let's go.
[372:38.86]Time to go.
[372:39.44]Time to go.
[372:39.92]Go, go, go, go, go.
[373:19.18]Man.
[373:36.46]Shoulda healed.
[373:37.16]It's just the plane that you're looking at.
[373:41.98]This makes it, because here, okay, here's the thing, right?
[373:45.70]So the right stick, I have to constantly, when I do this, this is me turning, this is me using the right stick.
[373:51.53]Right?
[373:52.23]So even when I'm locked on right now, that doesn't matter, I'm not, see?
[373:56.15]I have to always be keeping him in focus with right stick.
[374:00.57]It's like scratching your ass, scratching your head, rubbing your elbows, and fucking patting your tummy at the same time.
[374:11.33]But I constantly have to have Right Stick moving.
[374:53.74]Oh, shit!
[374:57.14]Use the steering wheel.
[375:08.84]Come on, really?
[375:31.92]Watch out, watch out.
[375:43.83]God damn it, man.
[375:45.29]Come on, I need to hit him one more fucking time.
[375:47.08]Get out of my way!
[376:24.23]got lucky there
[376:51.58]Where the fuck even?
[376:52.88]Bullshit.
[376:58.45]Oh, this is fucking living hell.
[377:06.89]I'm gonna come- Oh my god!
[377:35.85]I can't even fucking see.
[377:45.26]I don't even have it on my... Why is it not on my hotbar?
[377:48.26]Of all the things to not have.
[378:05.73]See you later.
[378:24.20]No sensitivity change will help either.
[378:32.05]Just dodge!
[378:34.69]I wish it was that easy.
[378:46.72]Try parries?
[378:47.50]No, I gotta just get the... Actually, I probably should do parries.
[378:51.66]Because dodging around a boss is almost uncompletable.
[378:58.37]So, maybe parries will work.
[379:04.35]Let's see what we can fire.
[379:23.54]I don't think I really have much.
[379:31.38]This is going to fuck up my rolls.
[379:35.60]I mean, I already have this on.
[379:40.77]What am I, mid-rolling?
[379:41.57]Hmm, not really.
[379:45.97]Equip the Ember.
[379:46.67]This is the worst thing, because I've sold a shitload of them.
[379:49.28]Like, this sucks.
[380:01.40]I don't know.
[380:01.98]See what I'm talking about?
[380:02.66]See what I mean?
[380:04.27]Like, that shit happens all the fucking time.
[380:07.39]There's no way to counteract it.
[380:10.03]He's just gonna, like, teleport around, and I have to... Oh, why even explain it?
[380:13.93]I've explained it, like, 30 times already.
[380:15.37]I think I might just kill myself.
[380:47.42]It's time to give up.
[380:48.56]I'm so close.
[380:49.41]I got about, like, half health.
[380:51.85]And I know what I'm doing is excruciating and is very, very, very hard and unnecessary, but I'm gonna try to do it.
[381:01.93]If I pulled out the third person, I would beat this first track.
[381:05.44]I would put $50,000 on that.
[381:06.80]But it doesn't matter.
[381:09.22]I'm gonna do this.
[381:10.22]I'm gonna do it the way- I'm gonna do it.
[381:11.98]It's gonna happen.
[381:39.24]The true wall.
[381:48.69]Doesn't seem that hard to me.
[381:50.27]Stop that!
[381:51.11]You know it's hard!
[381:51.93]Don't do that to me!
[381:52.77]This is probably the hardest thing I've ever done on screen.
[382:12.88]Carnage isn't a superhero.
[382:14.65]What the fuck?
[382:15.11]Yes he is!
[382:21.49]You've done harder things.
[382:22.79]I know, I can do it.
[382:27.49]Don't read while fighting.
[382:29.83]I need some little wine.
[382:35.58]Didn't I say... I said this, like, last stream.
[382:39.14]No, no, no.
[382:40.24]The stream before that.
[382:42.26]You know, I think I'm gonna take a break from doing fucking really difficult shit on stream.
[382:46.96]What happened?
[382:50.17]It's been two days!
[383:14.22]Oh my god, the guy behind... Fuck first person mode.
[383:18.31]Fuck first person mode.
[383:20.25]It's too much.
[383:22.15]It's fun for the first five hours.
[383:24.21]Ugh.
[383:52.64]Put your facecam in one of the item slots.
[383:54.37]I'm about to.
[384:38.59]I've lost it all.
[384:39.83]This is no way.
[384:41.57]Not anymore.
[384:42.22]I'm going to have to put on the funny mods.
[384:46.76]This is just like my tongue is sticking out.
[384:48.54]Somebody grabbed it.
[384:50.02]And you just won't let me put my tongue back in my mouth.
[384:52.34]That's what I feel like I'm doing.
[384:59.15]The, like, right stick.
[385:00.53]I gotta keep you in frame the whole fucking time.
[385:02.61]Action!
[385:03.23]Sequence show director!
[385:04.67]Yes, will you stay in frame the whole time?
[385:06.94]Let me just move you around and make sure it's like a... Oh, what, that lock-on did this on its own?
[385:12.14]Let me just, like, keep you in frame.
[385:13.50]It's me, Steven fucking Spielberg!
[385:24.72]You gotta dodge too, but make sure you keep in fucking frame.
[385:26.83]Make sure you, like, keep them in frame the whole time with the right stick.
[385:29.60]That's the only way that's fucking possible.
[385:52.05]I can't do mouse and keyboard with it.
[385:53.26]The mod is not designed to be used with mouse and keyboard.
[385:56.82]At least for some reason when I do it.
[385:59.50]I have... I'll show you.
[386:05.71]Oh, I gotta like fucking Spielberg this guy.
[386:37.72]Just switch to IRL and drink wine.
[386:41.10]I'm about to.
[386:50.42]This is gonna turn into a fucking wine drinking stream real quick.
[387:01.74]It's too fucking hard to do this!
[387:05.36]If only the lock-on would just stay on and I didn't have to use right stick to constantly keep them in front of me.
[387:13.03]I'm about to just start drinking on stream.
[387:18.41]I need to level up.
[387:19.39]There's so many things wrong here.
[387:44.55]Damn it.
[387:45.73]I can't help it.
[387:46.47]I have to do it again.
[387:47.93]I'm losing my hair watching this stream.
[387:49.53]I'm losing my mind playing this stream.
[388:10.92]How did that hit me?
[388:11.48]You gotta give me a break here.
[388:15.39]Here comes his fucking friend.
[388:17.97]Change the bindings?
[388:18.97]How would that help?
[388:22.38]It's still right stick, it's not like it'll change anything.
[388:31.50]Oh god, because I wasn't locked on.
[388:46.29]Not even the right guy.
[388:47.07]Get outta here.
[388:48.71]I want nothing to do with you.
[388:56.60]Still here?
[388:57.16]Alright, I'm not reading chat anymore.
[389:00.04]I'm gonna focus on the video game.
[389:03.93]I got an idea.
[389:21.05]The distance!
[389:23.07]The distance!
[389:25.63]It's hard to tell what the distance is!
[389:36.92]I can feel it!
[389:37.80]I can feel it in my mouth!
[389:40.64]The saltine crackers that are just building up!
[389:43.84]And they won't stop, they're in my mouth!
[389:52.96]This is supposed to be Dark Souls Silly Mods Night, and it turned into the impossible first person challenge somehow over the course of this evening.
[390:36.54]What is going on?
[390:41.27]We're going as the invisible fucking man now.
[390:44.65]Here it comes.
[390:54.68]Did anyone even put you up to this challenge?
[390:56.52]No, I don't know why I continued to do it.
[391:00.35]I don't know, I just felt it was fun.
[391:02.09]I had a great time, and I still did.
[391:04.33]It was fun, and I really enjoyed it.
[391:07.13]I did, I truly did.
[391:08.99]But I hit the wall, and now it's time to be an invisible man.
[391:11.95]And I'm gonna beat it first fucking try.
[391:24.63]I'm gonna beat it as the invisible fucking man.
[391:39.30]This is almost as bad.
[391:40.38]It kind of is.
[391:43.24]This is not one of the mods, I assure you.
[391:46.44]Why do I feel like I'm running?
[391:47.68]Why am I slow?
[391:48.70]Am I slow?
[391:50.78]I feel slow.
[392:06.69]Or am I just getting strangely baited by how weird these hands are?
[392:09.63]I feel like I'm playing as one of the Watchers.
[392:20.56]I don't know why I did that.
[392:34.94]I'm going to lose as Invisible Man, aren't I?
[392:36.52]I can't lose as Invisible Man.
[392:47.20]Somehow this works.
[392:49.22]No, it's not.
[392:50.16]It really isn't.
[392:51.24]At least I can lock on.
[393:22.11]I don't even know what my character is.
[393:25.23]This actually might be harder.
[393:54.58]Where am I?
[394:08.53]Fucking invisible man.
[394:10.67]It's even worse!
[394:27.88]Fuck.
[395:12.13]I told you I was gonna beat it first fucking try.
[395:59.69]No, that wasn't a joke.
[396:01.75]I didn't know, I didn't think he was gonna fucking dash through.
[396:04.80]I thought he was gonna do that.
[396:08.98]I have so much anguish in my body right now.
[396:11.70]This was supposed to be a fun stream.
[396:14.68]And I wanna fucking, I wanna just, I wanna throw this guy into a joker vat of acid.
[396:22.16]It was supposed to be a jokey fun stream and it turned out to be like a tryhard dickhead stream.
[396:27.81]How did that happen?
[396:36.76]How's it like to get stuck in a corner, you dick?
[396:45.23]It's because I refused to- but I was having fun- oh god.
[396:50.13]I can't fucking believe it.
[396:51.37]Like, I literally beat it, and like, I had to just start talking.
[396:54.49]This is un-fucking-believable.
[396:58.89]Even as the invisible goddamn man, like, I had it.
[397:01.75]It was over.
[397:04.77]In fact, get this off.
[397:17.00]I'm so used to like the first person shit.
[397:20.03]Oh my god.
[397:20.49]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[397:21.59]I don't even care if it's on stream I'm just gonna stop pissing
[397:38.15]Oh, I'm so sad right now.
[397:40.26]There's too many emotions in my brain.
[397:42.70]I have to fucking just end this.
[397:44.30]I had it.
[397:44.72]It was first try, third person, and I guaranteed it.
[397:47.34]And it was a guarantee because it actually... I thought it... Here we go.
[397:51.25]No more talking.
[397:53.15]Just beat Abyss Watcher.
[397:55.35]Fucking the Watcher.
[397:56.16]I can't.
[397:56.62]I don't think I will.
[397:58.78]You literally came to the arcade and you took a sledgehammer.
[398:02.46]You sledgehammered the pinball machine.
[398:05.01]I am so far beyond being able to do this.
[398:12.55]You came in and you just started shaking the pinball machine.
[398:14.95]And you screamed at it.
[398:16.81]You put your foot through it.
[398:18.03]I can't even do it now.
[398:19.41]And this boss is not even that hard.
[398:21.02]Especially when you play the game normally.
[398:23.28]Unbelievable.
[398:34.60]It's truly un-fucking-believable that I just let that happen.
[398:43.18]Abyss Watchers are like the 30% of the way into the game.
[398:48.38]And I've let first person parasite attach itself to my fucking cerebral cortex.
[399:01.61]And it's making me want to punt my monitor 2,000 yards.
[399:05.87]Holy shit, people are giving a ton of community subs.
[399:07.96]Oh my god.
[399:16.65]Thank you Great Canadian Fuck Club and Kazzy for the subs.
[399:24.06]Somehow I'm still here.
[399:41.27]I, like, love this game too.
[399:42.91]I've beat this game, like, five fucking times.
[399:46.05]And we're at that stage of grief now.
[399:49.09]Where I'm walking around is this jokey enemy from Warcraft.
[399:54.25]This is a card in Hearthstone.
[400:06.75]This is a card in Hearthstone.
[400:08.09]It makes your opponent draw a card when he dies.
[400:10.27]I don't even know what the fuck the thing is called.
[400:12.48]Sword card.
[400:13.70]Dual swords.
[400:21.54]Oh god, I'm moving away.
[400:23.02]Where am I?
[400:27.33]Where the fuck is the character?
[400:28.43]I just don't know.
[400:29.81]I'm two fucking hands.
[400:42.16]I really appreciate all the people giving me tips in the chat, but you have to understand something.
[400:45.53]I beat these guys like probably seven or eight times.
[400:49.25]And it was just like a leisurely playthrough on like my eighth character.
[400:53.56]Oh, I hate this.
[401:02.04]I'm so tilted.
[401:04.19]I'm not even a human anymore.
[401:05.99]I'm no longer a person.
[401:17.91]I've transcended being a human.
[401:23.55]It might be time for silly mod mode.
[401:34.58]Because I am so tilted right now.
[401:36.42]I don't think I'll ever beat these guys.
[401:38.60]Like, ever again.
[401:54.01]Why can I not see my character?
[401:56.43]This would be so much easier if I could.
[401:59.54]Oh, man.
[402:01.14]You know, sometimes I sit there and I think about what's going to happen on the screen.
[402:05.91]If you had told me, hey Jeremy, on your next stream, you're going to do a Dark Souls mod stream, you're going to get stuck on Abyss Watchers for three hours.
[402:14.15]I'd be like, there's something wrong with your brain.
[402:16.82]Like, there's no way.
[402:19.34]No way.
[402:19.74]You're crazy.
[402:20.48]No fucking way.
[402:22.78]And here we are.
[402:25.12]Here we are, seven hours into the stream.
[402:28.58]Stuck on the goddamn Abyss Watchers as Invisible Man.
[402:54.24]Where the fuck I am?
[403:14.76]I don't know.
[403:15.46]Oh my god, I had five flasks.
[403:19.32]I can't fucking believe this.
[403:25.95]This build is so bad.
[403:27.61]Everything about this is so bad.
[403:29.08]It was just the first...
[404:12.93]No!
[404:13.45]Why am I still invisible, man?
[404:15.08]I turned it off!
[404:36.17]I think I have to restart the whole game.
[404:38.61]I fucked myself from the very beginning.
[404:41.30]Alright, alright.
[404:42.58]Bullshit!
[404:43.37]Fuck you!
[404:56.98]It's too hard to see.
[404:58.90]Playing like this.
[405:00.91]No way.
[405:01.91]I don't believe it.
[405:03.01]I don't believe it.
[405:03.69]No.
[405:04.01]And there we go.
[405:04.47]Now I'm a fucking person again.
[405:05.85]Let's try it now as an actual person.
[405:09.35]Let me try it now as the way the game is supposed to be played.
[405:12.10]As Invisible Man, not as first person mode.
[405:15.88]Oh my fucking god.
[405:31.77]What did I just turn on?
[405:32.55]I have no idea.
[405:33.25]I'm so fucking tilted right now.
[405:35.90]No.
[405:42.30]It went from, like, the first four and a half hours of the stream was, This is fun.
[405:47.06]Hey, this is all fun.
[405:48.85]I'm having a great time.
[405:50.33]Oh, first person.
[405:51.47]First person is really fun.
[405:53.73]This is interesting.
[405:54.35]Look, have you ever seen the game from this perspective before?
[406:14.03]And now I'm like, I should have just opened up the fast funny mod at four hours.
[406:20.03]You guys were right.
[406:21.31]You had the right idea.
[406:24.84]You all knew this was going to happen.
[406:26.72]You knew I was going to get to a boss that you can't do it on, and I was going to lose my fucking mind, and then here we are.
[406:34.21]You guys have the prediction capability of goddamn Nostradamus.
[406:42.61]The first person was really interesting.
[406:44.13]It's really fun.
[406:44.59]It's really hard.
[406:47.95]But sometimes... I don't... This feels very foreign to me.
[406:56.61]This... I don't like how this feels.
[406:58.21]I'm... I don't like this.
[406:59.53]It feels weird.
[407:00.17]This feels fucking weird.
[407:13.47]Sounds like my character shouldn't be here.
[407:15.43]Anybody else feel like that?
[407:44.14]I might have to take a wine-only break here.
[407:47.68]Because everything about the last seven hours has been not this.
[407:51.78]It's like freaking me out.
[407:56.18]What the fuck?
[408:03.64]I shouldn't be here right now.
[408:11.85]Actually, it's kind of nice to see where I'm going to get hit.
[408:22.06]I have to give it one at least solid attempt with an actual character.
[408:50.15]Come on.
[408:50.37]Game over.
[408:59.55]Come on.
[409:00.41]Don't blow it here.
[409:01.09]You've got six S's.
[409:02.17]Just fucking do it.
[409:03.23]Let's do it.
[409:05.36]Alright.
[409:05.68]Let's try it.
[409:06.22]Let's go.
[409:47.28]Thank you.
[410:24.64]Oops-a-daisy!
[411:19.59]First fucking time I put on a goddamn no invisible man, no first person bullshit.
[411:23.33]I beat him first try.
[411:24.41]That's not that bad of a fight.
[411:25.87]I did it first fucking time without any goddamn bullshit on it.
[411:29.52]And I got to see my character walk around.
[411:48.48]I just grabbed the bottle of wine.
[411:50.08]I'm not even drinking out of the glass anymore.
[411:51.91]What a sicko.
[411:58.85]No, put that down.
[412:02.27]Okay, that was fun.
[412:16.65]All I take was just to play Dark Souls.
[412:21.79]I just had to play Dark Souls 3, and I did it the first time I played Dark Souls 3.
[412:27.74]It's time to get fucking silly, okay?
[412:30.26]You ready for silly?
[412:31.62]You ready for silly mods?
[412:43.20]What time is it?
[412:44.70]Oh, we're still early?
[412:45.58]Is it still early?
[412:46.29]You guys still ready to go?
[412:50.39]Time to get fucking wacky.
[413:03.55]Why did I do that?
[413:05.48]Why did I do first person for seven hours?
[413:08.44]There's no reason for what I just did.
[413:12.74]Oh, my God.
[413:14.64]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[413:18.56]Something in the water, guys.
[413:20.77]I'm telling you.
[413:29.99]Be careful.
[413:36.37]Alright.
[413:36.99]I'm going to buy these back.
[413:46.32]Alright.
[413:47.58]You ready?
[413:47.96]I have no idea what this is going to do.
[413:52.24]I'm going to try it though.
[413:54.18]Welcome to Silly Mods!
[413:58.93]Let's enable this.
[414:01.75]And see where it takes us.
[414:09.53]I might have to restart the game.
[414:12.62]I do.
[414:22.92]That's what my character looks like.
[414:23.92]I don't remember.
[414:28.62]Restart the game and we're going to do... There are plenty of other things.
[414:33.62]But let's be fair.
[414:34.52]I was having a great time.
[414:36.60]Even losing, even getting frustrated, even losing my wine mind.
[414:39.44]It was a lot of fun.
[414:48.71]So let's go ahead and do this again.
[414:55.13]Okay, open up that.
[414:56.85]Open up Dark Souls.
[415:10.20]Liar and a cheater.
[415:14.88]God, I was my own worst enemy for the last hour and a half.
[415:27.57]Alright, I'm gonna turn, uh... Let's change this to... To Dark Souls 3 Silly Mods.
[415:42.76]How about Dark Souls 3 Mod Night?
[415:55.54]We just started, welcome to the stream.
[416:00.53]Thanks for joining me.
[416:01.63]Welcome to the stream.
[416:10.81]Okay.
[416:12.33]So we've got speed modifier... Well, actually, I want to try this one.
[416:16.81]I don't know what the hell this does, but...
[416:27.54]I believe this makes every enemy a prop.
[416:36.85]Well, already right off the bat, they're just tombstones.
[416:39.18]This is going to be horrible.
[416:56.29]Yeah, this is prop hunt Dark Souls.
[417:09.22]Okay, I just want to see, let's take a look.
[417:29.64]Looks pretty normal so far.
[417:35.44]Oh, I wonder what that is.
[417:37.53]That's definitely not an enemy.
[417:46.13]Can they even attack?
[417:52.34]Holy shit!
[417:53.20]Okay, they can.
[417:53.88]Alright, I gotta... I don't... You can't fight... You can't kill that guy.
[418:00.17]Why are they all the same thing?
[418:06.67]They're all just... They're all just fucking tubes.
[418:16.45]They're just skeleton urns.
[418:17.95]I don't understand why.
[418:20.77]There's no other... I can't lock onto them either.
[418:31.44]Oh, his apparel.
[418:34.24]There's too many.
[418:40.18]This one has eyes.
[418:56.86]The mod sucks.
[418:57.84]What?
[419:00.01]Let's try another area.
[419:00.93]I need to see a boss as an urn.
[419:07.28]Let's head to the deacons.
[419:24.75]First person... First person.
[419:27.91]First person and no more donations.
[419:35.28]Is that one of the big guys?
[419:37.09]I think that's one of the huge guys.
[419:43.19]There's no way to even tell when he's swinging.
[419:52.77]What's the reason to fight?
[419:59.09]This is fucking stupid.
[420:01.07]I don't want to play this one.
[420:12.11]All this mod does is say, hey, you know those enemies that you fight?
[420:16.25]You don't know when they're going to do their animation.
[420:21.74]Do this and the first person mod.
[420:27.28]Let's try this with first person.
[420:45.87]uh oh hold on he's addicted to first person alright here we go why is this person not
[421:13.04]You shouldn't be here like this.
[421:14.88]Why are you not a bucket?
[421:28.01]Who the?
[421:30.51]Why are you guys not fucking inanimate objects?
[421:53.91]You're dead.
[422:09.27]How did you spin around that quickly?
[422:10.41]Not even fair.
[422:10.93]Don't you fucking kill me here.
[422:40.20]Are these props?
[422:44.41]It's just an excuse.
[422:45.27]He wants to play in first person.
[422:46.49]No, those are NPCs, so they have to be... Free ban for $100.
[422:53.77]What?
[422:57.84]So, does the mod work?
[423:02.56]Of course it does.
[423:10.38]That person's a clock.
[423:13.26]It's a dog that dogs.
[423:17.20]I get it.
[423:22.56]Why is he so fast?
[423:24.37]What the hell was that?
[423:26.41]Why was he that fast?
[423:35.15]What?
[423:44.12]I don't know why he was that fast.
[423:45.50]Where's the other dog?
[423:50.41]I saw one already.
[423:51.33]Can you just get me in the door?
[423:56.20]Shit.
[424:19.05]Next!
[424:21.19]Put them all on at once.
[424:22.53]I will crash the game.
[424:26.98]I'm just gonna run by.
[424:27.78]I don't know how many there are, but... The boxes are just dropping all over me.
[424:49.69]What is this thing?
[424:55.54]What is he doing?
[424:58.88]Oh, it's one of those exploding bats.
[425:06.33]They light themselves on fire, they run and they land in front of you and they blow up.
[425:18.40]Please do a different mod.
[425:19.58]I- hold on.
[425:22.04]We've gotta get to at least a stopping point here.
[425:31.61]Really?
[425:33.03]Get out of the fucking way.
[425:35.87]Grandfather clock asshole.
[425:40.48]Alright, watch out, he's gonna explode.
[425:49.80]What?
[425:50.32]Oh, right, there's a bunch of people here.
[425:55.54]I'm surrounded!
[425:58.02]I got the shard, okay.
[426:08.86]Alright, alright, we're good.
[426:10.24]I'm not gonna use it.
[426:32.11]Shut it off.
[426:32.89]Not yet.
[426:41.67]I gotta get to the point.
[426:43.61]You don't want me to get to the point up here and there's like a hundred skeletons.
[426:47.23]You think that's gonna be fun?
[427:06.22]Zero viewers.
[427:08.68]Alright, that's the DLC.
[427:10.28]Yeah, we're gonna go up to the Hollow Graveyard.
[427:18.85]You don't want to see that before I turn off this dumb mod.
[427:35.01]Alright, what do you think?
[427:36.03]Boxes?
[427:36.31]Clocks?
[427:38.43]He can't kill me.
[427:43.45]Is that a... Is it actually an urn?
[427:46.33]No.
[427:46.79]No.
[427:57.75]They throw up too.
[428:03.34]How many more?
[428:17.01]This was funny for four minutes tops.
[428:19.93]Well, don't worry.
[428:20.47]When I get up here, we're going to turn it off.
[428:33.76]Isn't there a strong enemy up here?
[428:36.98]There's an NPC up here, right?
[428:48.86]Ow.
[428:51.12]Is that it?
[428:52.72]That's an NPC.
[428:53.56]Oh, shit.
[429:13.06]What is that?
[429:16.60]Fucking urn chased me all the way.
[429:23.73]Alright, time for a new mod.
[429:29.89]What else we got?
[429:32.25]Alright, let's take it off first person.
[429:37.06]Oh boy, okay.
[429:38.24]Okay, let's take it off.
[429:48.52]So here's the difference here.
[429:49.36]What does this one do?
[429:59.80]This one is supposed to be player size?
[430:07.91]I wonder how... I might have to restart this one.
[430:10.23]Whatever this one does.
[430:11.53]What's this one?
[430:20.50]So this is a speed modifier.
[430:24.53]This is randomizing the speed of the game.
[430:34.98]This is just horrible.
[430:35.78]This is just lag.
[430:38.40]I don't want to play like this.
[430:43.53]This is terrible!
[430:52.45]This is playing with 500 ping.
[431:23.66]Activate all mobs at once.
[431:24.92]I'll do it before we leave.
[431:32.06]No, I don't like this.
[431:32.96]I gotta get out of this.
[431:57.75]Hold on.
[431:59.33]Let's try this.
[432:03.49]I'm going to die here.
[432:04.37]It doesn't matter.
[432:06.61]Okay, what if I do... Let's see.
[432:10.83]Like times 0.5 speed?
[432:18.13]What does that do?
[432:23.67]Okay.
[432:29.14]Is this just my character?
[432:33.26]Versus bosses?
[432:40.14]This would be fucking ridiculous.
[432:50.37]Turn-based combat.
[432:55.43]But is it just me or is it all the enemies too?
[433:01.29]I have to fight a boss with this.
[433:04.43]You can see every frame.
[433:18.84]I don't think it's everybody.
[433:20.36]I think it's just me.
[433:23.24]Is it?
[433:24.80]No, it's everybody.
[433:39.55]What?
[433:39.85]This is... I can pew up every dodge.
[433:52.27]This is amazing.
[433:59.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[433:59.78]Don't do it yet.
[434:00.42]He's going to jump.
[434:04.02]What?
[434:14.05]Alright, well that was fun.
[434:24.88]Let's try this.
[434:30.44]Oh, man.
[434:45.74]I can't.
[434:50.18]Where?
[434:50.42]I don't know where.
[434:51.02]What direction do I go?
[434:59.91]Wait, hold on.
[435:00.47]I got an idea.
[435:00.97]I got an idea.
[435:03.63]I got an idea.
[435:06.91]This is gonna be fucking great.
[435:07.95]Watch this one.
[435:13.04]Check this out.
[435:13.80]Ready?
[435:21.00]This is gonna be real fucking cool.
[435:22.48]Okay, so...
[435:32.02]I can control it a little better now.
[435:33.20]Watch this.
[435:34.08]Oops.
[435:57.79]Go back to Andre.
[435:58.87]Let me try to get somewhere reliably.
[436:50.50]I hate everything about this.
[436:52.24]This is the worst one yet.
[437:04.04]No, fuck!
[437:18.24]Now wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[437:19.31]There's also something else I can do here.
[437:21.97]Hold on.
[437:25.87]I need to get in here.
[437:28.09]You're gonna love this one.
[437:33.57]But my weapons.
[437:34.37]My weapons are still too big.
[437:39.91]A little, like, rat mode.
[437:43.35]With huge weapons.
[437:49.18]This is normal speed.
[437:59.30]My hitbox is tiny.
[438:05.02]They can't hit me.
[438:06.04]Oh, that guy figured it out.
[438:21.68]First person with this model.
[438:23.95]Now, let me just get to another place to go.
[438:32.41]Tiny first person mode.
[438:33.83]Hold on.
[438:48.15]Gnome Fury Warrior.
[438:58.50]Alright, I gotta turn my speed down.
[439:01.70]Hold on.
[439:02.40]Is it safe?
[439:14.34]Don't worry, he's not gonna hit me.
[439:28.51]Alright, first person.
[439:34.69]Weapon.
[439:35.17]Okay, here we go.
[439:35.83]Weapon size.
[439:48.80]Uh, what are these things called?
[439:57.05]Are these thrusting swords?
[439:58.17]What are these?
[440:03.09]Are they not curved swords?
[440:04.23]Daggers?
[440:04.63]What would these be classified as?
[440:08.58]Curved swords?
[440:13.56]Okay, what are they even called?
[440:16.22]Karthus curved swords?
[440:17.50]What are they called?
[440:20.68]They're the twin blades, right?
[440:22.64]They're not here.
[440:31.04]I'm trying to find them.
[440:47.65]I'm trying to find out what these are called so I can enable this.
[440:52.79]Because I don't see them on any list.
[440:54.61]Maybe I can't change them.
[441:11.76]Oh.
[441:39.14]The fall damage is not significant at all.
[441:42.29]I don't even know where I am.
[441:44.47]Okay, I gotta...
[442:11.84]I gotta slow down the... Hold on.
[442:16.28]Okay.
[442:17.08]I gotta turn down the stupid mod for speed.
[442:23.19]That's probably better.
[442:23.89]And then first person.
[442:34.01]Okay.
[442:40.51]Well, that didn't really work, did it?
[442:45.62]That didn't work.
[442:46.26]I'm swinging over this enemy.
[443:12.52]No, I don't.
[443:13.34]Nice.
[443:21.56]What the fuck?
[443:24.42]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[443:25.84]Okay.
[443:36.40]This is too much.
[443:40.84]Hold on.
[443:41.22]I don't know what this does.
[443:53.38]Green?
[443:54.48]No.
[443:56.12]Skeleton swap.
[443:58.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[443:59.48]This is... Let's simmer this down a little bit, okay?
[444:11.55]Come back to normal.
[444:15.29]Okay, everything's back to normal.
[444:16.93]Now let's do this.
[444:25.60]I think this, I can be an enemy.
[444:33.38]Let's go back to what we were doing.
[444:37.63]So let's go small.
[444:46.57]Okay.
[444:50.73]First person.
[444:51.27]Let's see if we can do it in first person.
[444:53.84]Not really.
[444:56.40]No, it doesn't work.
[444:58.28]Ooh, that's funky.
[445:00.18]You can't do small in first person.
[445:06.69]It's not gonna work.
[445:12.29]In fact, I think I broke the game.
[445:14.31]I think it's all fucked up.
[445:16.69]Nobody's jiggling around.
[445:20.31]Oh, there we go.
[445:28.16]Alright, I'm ready.
[445:43.83]Let's play.
[445:55.99]Uh, why am I going so slow?
[446:01.43]Why am I this slow?
[446:11.93]That's better, right?
[446:12.81]There we go.
[446:13.09]Alright, now I'm gonna do a boss.
[446:36.91]Where's the nearest boss?
[446:48.13]Oh, the Deacons, right.
[446:50.08]I gotta go all the way down for that though, don't I?
[446:52.42]There's the Skeleton King, that's true.
[447:11.75]Speed it up!
[447:23.22]The Deacons are gonna be harder at this size.
[447:25.66]They probably will.
[447:28.60]What about up here?
[447:29.12]Another up here?
[447:31.77]I'm so cute and tiny.
[447:34.47]I really just am.
[447:44.28]Run, little buddy.
[447:45.26]Yeah, I got this already.
[447:47.96]I think I have to go down here, don't I?
[447:59.82]What?
[448:15.65]I was too small for the floor.
[448:19.01]Change your weapon so you have a Tom and Jerry mallet.
[448:43.34]Well, this is the point of the game where I don't really remember exactly where to go.
[448:55.64]Go back to Firelink.
[449:06.57]There's just no clip to the Deacons?
[449:08.19]I can't do that.
[449:13.74]I don't think I can even do that.
[449:14.74]I think I have to go through here.
[449:23.63]It's to the right of the cathedral.
[449:25.07]Yeah, I'll get down.
[449:27.89]Hold on.
[449:28.25]I have to go around and then... I was going the right way, wasn't I?
[449:40.78]Go back to Firelink.
[449:42.08]What's at Firelink?
[449:50.93]Oh, Andre.
[449:53.05]Yeah, but I mean, wait.
[449:54.17]Who cares?
[449:56.66]Andre's small, so.
[449:59.94]Don't you want to see the deacons?
[450:05.15]Let me just at least try to get, OK, if I can't do this, then I'll go back.
[450:19.69]Do a skeleton swap with a normal sized character?
[450:24.51]Well, I need like an ID.
[450:25.97]I need an ID number.
[450:27.05]Alright, is this gonna work?
[450:39.14]This is not gonna work.
[450:43.88]I'm in the wall.
[450:49.74]I need to be bigger first.
[451:00.45]Alright, I'm gonna go the other way.
[451:16.57]That was the wrong way anyways.
[451:29.87]The fall joke returns, and I wasn't even trying to do it.
[451:39.23]I tried to climb back up.
[451:45.65]Okay, so I'm gonna go through here.
[451:47.35]I'm trying to just remember where the hell to go from here.
[451:56.64]This way?
[452:04.27]He's not going to hit me with this anyway.
[452:26.31]Alright.
[452:28.41]So now, this way.
[452:30.87]Is there a way for me to get up from here?
[452:46.36]There, okay, yeah, now I remember, okay.
[452:48.26]I know, I remember.
[452:50.52]I remember.
[453:02.80]It's actually fairly hard to control.
[453:07.02]I'm so small.
[453:21.64]Put on the Looney Tunes soundtrack.
[453:24.04]Don't go that way.
[453:36.36]Looney Tunes OST.
[453:37.52]They don't even have an OST.
[453:38.48]They have like a theme song.
[453:41.14]Alright, we're getting there.
[454:06.81]Oh good.
[454:41.48]Dr. Phil?
[454:42.46]Why do you want Dr. Phil of all the things right now?
[454:45.17]Alright.
[455:02.12]It's time to make this a little more interesting.
[455:12.61]Once I get the shortcut, I'm gonna make it interesting.
[455:20.14]I'm gonna decrease my speed by... What the fuck just happened?
[455:27.21]Oh my god.
[455:27.87]I wasn't... I didn't weigh enough.
[455:29.69]What?
[455:35.86]Oh no, that's not good.
[456:26.28]Can I speedrun this?
[456:27.04]I don't think I can.
[456:35.42]Well, that's so unfortunate.
[456:39.62]I was right there, too!
[456:41.84]How slow are these guys?
[456:55.03]They're very slow.
[456:56.15]Alright.
[457:00.66]I got the right idea.
[457:01.92]Here we go.
[457:02.40]Ready?
[457:17.51]This should be good.
[457:20.11]Now we're just cheating.
[457:21.49]Yeah, this is not even a mod at this point.
[457:23.29]It's just cheating.
[457:36.13]You were at the first shortcut, literally.
[457:38.01]I know, it sucks.
[457:48.66]Just beat the game in an hour?
[457:51.02]That's a pretty good challenge to me.
[457:56.64]I'll take that challenge.
[458:35.50]Oh fuck.
[459:02.79]shortcut this won't let me it won't let me
[459:32.36]It's just stopping me from... Fucking Jesus, we've done this like 50 times.
[459:40.51]Oh my god, just... I don't even care.
[459:42.55]I don't even need it!
[459:44.57]Let's go.
[459:44.99]I don't even need a shortcut.
[459:47.20]At this point, just get there.
[460:08.77]It is late right now, damn.
[460:10.81]It's like, it's very late for you guys.
[460:17.26]I'm surprised there's still this many people here.
[460:20.02]There's like 34, 3500 people here.
[460:21.32]Holy shit.
[460:22.34]Thanks for sticking around guys, hope you're having a good time.
[460:29.23]I am.
[460:30.87]This is just stupid enough to keep my attention.
[460:40.06]Alright, I'm just gonna run right to the Deacons.
[461:00.13]This is actually making it harder.
[461:03.49]Don't do that!
[461:04.15]Because you're going so fast, you can't even see what's in front of you.
[461:14.13]Alright, don't fuck this up again.
[461:16.31]Just go to the Deacons.
[461:20.42]I need to beat Dark Souls 3 in an hour.
[461:22.56]What time is it?
[461:24.02]Alright, I have an hour to beat the whole game.
[461:51.29]Ugh.
[461:52.05]I'll get you real soon.
[461:56.24]Fuck it.
[461:56.58]I can fall from this high.
[461:57.66]Can I?
[461:58.00]Can I do it?
[461:58.80]Yep, I'm good.
[462:21.60]This is just cheating.
[462:23.04]There's no... This is just... Yeah, it's a Quicksilver mod.
[462:42.98]It's not even hard!
[462:44.20]I can just beat everything!
[462:45.60]Alright, let's just...
[463:11.07]Okay.
[463:40.26]That guy got a shot off.
[463:43.48]Look at this guy.
[463:44.50]You motherfucker!
[463:50.83]I missed him.
[463:54.91]Why don't we make it a little fucking easy?
[463:57.29]You get everyone saying, oh, you're a cheater.
[463:59.57]You're a cheater.
[464:00.35]Let's see how you feel.
[464:02.32]Let's see how you feel now.
[464:29.15]Where's the deacon?
[464:40.34]Catch the mouse, yes.
[465:05.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[465:13.66]Oh god!
[465:14.18]Where the fuck...
[465:39.07]He's too hard to target.
[465:43.06]Too fast, too fast, too fast.
[466:16.33]There's no way.
[466:17.39]It's possible.
[466:21.87]Somebody's got fire breath.
[466:25.26]It's just Deacon Pinball.
[466:30.84]Alright.
[466:31.38]Okay.
[466:32.44]Okay.
[466:33.66]Okay.
[466:34.00]That was fun.
[466:34.60]This was really funny.
[466:36.77]Oh, that was fun, wasn't it?
[466:53.90]Okay, let's change the player size.
[466:55.64]That's too big.
[466:59.03]Uh, I don't know why that's still so big.
[467:04.21]I shouldn't be this big.
[467:07.47]What's on my head?
[467:24.94]Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna lose.
[467:26.40]Yeah, the hunter just became the hunted.
[467:44.21]Where- Why can't I hurt these guys?
[467:49.03]That's the guy- That's the deacon right there.
[467:52.13]I can't hurt him.
[468:06.25]Okay, back to normal.
[468:07.31]Holy fuck.
[468:09.56]Alright.
[468:12.56]Let's beat the D.
[468:35.94]Oh yeah, what about the one hour challenge?
[468:45.21]Hold on, hold on.
[468:50.27]They seem a little too slow.
[468:51.33]I think it's just because we're so fucked up from everything that happened so far.
[469:01.64]Alright, so the deacons just became... Some of them became chairs.
[469:06.70]Some of them became statues.
[469:16.75]Don't you wish this is what the original fight was?
[469:33.71]Where is he?
[469:35.57]Who has the glow?
[469:41.28]Oh shit.
[470:02.19]I'm not gonna get cursed, don't worry.
[470:09.18]Although it is kind of hard to tell when they're gonna do anything!
[470:26.61]Here it comes.
[470:28.48]Holy shit, I watched it happen.
[470:30.06]They're just cheating and losing at one of the easiest boss fights.
[470:37.47]They're all chairs!
[470:38.79]Do you understand?
[470:43.23]I can't lose here though, for real.
[470:58.45]Imagine losing to a chair.
[471:02.23]And I can't lock onto them.
[471:14.93]Goddammit.
[471:27.51]What a mess.
[471:29.07]What a mess.
[471:30.73]Die now.
[471:31.59]Die now.
[471:32.57]Oh god.
[471:34.03]Which chair is he?
[471:48.20]Where was the curse menu?
[471:49.20]Where was the curse menu?
[471:50.08]That's the end of the stream.
[472:29.31]Alright, I'm trying Skeleton Swap.
[472:33.59]Model ID.
[472:34.45]There's like Pus of Man.
[472:36.08]Some of these don't work.
[472:48.93]Player.
[472:52.31]What are these?
[472:53.59]Like 2,000.
[472:58.33]Doesn't seem to do anything.
[473:03.81]I would love to be a chair.
[473:08.49]Model... Because it's giving me IDs, but it's not changing anything.
[473:23.98]Player model... Cathedral Knight?
[473:33.75]Oh my god, what is happening?
[474:01.21]What scarecrow enemy is this?
[474:03.27]What is going on?
[474:05.54]No, this is me.
[474:13.16]It's making my skeleton different.
[474:16.33]I see.
[474:16.83]Okay, hold on.
[474:21.91]Let me turn.
[474:22.31]Let me take.
[474:22.67]Oh, fuck.
[474:23.85]This is not good.
[474:30.25]Let's reload him.
[474:31.97]Reload player.
[474:33.39]Here we are.
[474:40.65]So we gotta get off all this bullshit.
[474:47.47]Okay.
[474:51.03]Let's try this again.
[474:53.39]This time we're gonna do... Hollow outside of Crystal Sage.
[475:19.86]How do I swing?
[475:21.20]Can I even attack?
[475:22.14]I don't think I can attack.
[475:47.42]into a passive run.
[475:49.56]I gotta get back to the goddamn deacons like this, okay?
[475:55.95]Unequip the weapon?
[475:56.87]I can't.
[475:59.61]Let me see if there's just no animation.
[476:18.19]I don't think so.
[476:19.79]Hold on.
[476:23.22]Um... What the hell is this going to look like, I wonder?
[476:32.22]It's just a face.
[476:34.02]That's it.
[476:37.92]It's just a face.
[476:42.22]What about giant rats?
[476:51.58]Oh, what?
[476:53.26]What is the knife in the back of my head?
[476:58.47]The sword is in my skull.
[477:00.95]What?
[477:02.59]It's through my fucking face.
[477:05.37]Oh, come on.
[477:06.85]This is the stupidest thing ever.
[477:15.76]I didn't even get the deacon shortcut either.
[477:28.91]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[477:30.40]Can I drink?
[477:30.88]I can't even drink Estus.
[477:49.28]Oh, that's so ridiculous.
[477:52.33]Hold on, let me just see if I can... Maybe animation override, maybe.
[478:08.34]I need to be able to attack.
[478:32.12]Which way is the head?
[478:37.39]Is that a foot up top?
[478:39.41]I think that's a foot up there.
[478:44.70]But I still can't swing a weapon.
[478:46.48]Let me see.
[479:00.31]Okay, we've got... Angel...
[479:09.89]Tree Hollow.
[479:14.37]Dancer.
[479:14.85]Here's Dancer.
[479:15.61]Uh oh.
[479:20.48]That crashed the game.
[479:27.46]Game crashed.
[479:30.22]Phone's over.
[479:41.83]Unequip the weapons?
[479:44.65]Okay, I will.
[479:50.75]Oh, the fun is over.
[479:52.11]Oh, that doesn't look right.
[480:08.02]I thought I just got banned.
[480:11.50]I was like, oh no.
[480:12.20]That's not good.
[480:13.14]Alright.
[480:24.74]Let's go ahead and try this again.
[480:26.06]I'm gonna take off my weapons, though.
[480:30.91]Banned from single player.
[480:33.13]Well, I don't know.
[480:33.63]Alright.
[480:35.93]Weapons are off.
[480:37.35]I just have fists.
[480:38.23]I have no equipment on.
[480:39.23]Nothing.
[480:39.65]Get rid of all equipment.
[480:44.22]See if I can do anything now.
[480:47.14]Skeleton swap.
[480:51.84]Let's give it a go.
[481:03.68]So we got Dancer.
[481:05.72]We can't do Dancer.
[481:07.75]Let's try Tree Hollow.
[481:13.69]It's just an extra large foot.
[481:28.83]Some of them just crash the game.
[481:38.08]Somebody just said, parade float.
[481:46.33]Oh, that was good.
[481:48.97]That was really good.
[481:54.81]So this is not going to work.
[482:03.00]What else we got?
[482:05.37]Painter, Ice Crab, Cinder.
[482:08.78]Here's Yhorm.
[482:09.94]Yhorm's gonna crash the game.
[482:11.06]I would put money on it.
[482:15.90]No, it's not.
[482:25.41]How do I...
[482:51.70]I'm coming!
[482:53.18]I'm coming to get you, Lord of Cinder!
[483:22.52]god he fell he fell one foot yeah I know alright let's see a few more of these and then I'm probably gonna call it a night it's been a long night of absolute is pontiff animation override I wonder what this means
[483:58.26]Half the stream was you dying to Abyss Watchers.
[484:01.85]Well, sometimes that's what happens.
[484:03.21]You have to bind the animations in order to use attacks.
[484:17.50]Really.
[484:20.71]Hmm.
[484:30.68]Oh, this is gonna crash the stream.
[484:33.44]Is it?
[484:35.28]This is the great way.
[484:35.94]This is the tree.
[484:50.05]But wait.
[484:52.55]We can see the whole thing.
[484:53.55]Hold on.
[485:02.97]Come on, I can't make myself smaller?
[485:15.02]I can't.
[485:19.12]I wish I could see.
[485:19.89]I can't get out of the door.
[485:34.10]Yeah, this is just a big piece of wood.
[485:37.96]It's a shovel.
[485:50.11]Did I kill somebody?
[486:06.13]No, that's not what I think it is, right?
[486:10.21]No, it isn't.
[486:10.93]That's a leg.
[486:12.49]I just almost got this in the head.
[486:16.83]Can you see my head up there?
[486:17.89]Look at how tiny the head is.
[486:31.14]Look at the shadow.
[486:36.61]Alright, let's try one or two more and then I'm going to call it.
[486:42.73]This is a deacon.
[486:51.08]That's not too crazy.
[486:52.12]Uh oh.
[487:09.06]Do the crab?
[487:09.80]Okay, we'll do crab.
[487:13.94]Crab.
[487:27.74]Where's the crab?
[487:37.25]Giant crab.
[487:37.97]There it is.
[487:48.18]It's just a face.
[487:58.57]Where's the body?
[488:01.65]You can hear the legs, too.
[488:05.09]Did you force animation override?
[488:06.61]I did.
[488:06.89]I have that on right now.
[488:21.43]It's a new emote.
[488:23.59]I don't think so.
[488:26.38]It's too scary.
[488:29.82]No, we already did the dog.
[488:32.79]Stray Demon.
[488:33.77]This one will be interesting.
[489:02.63]Really?
[489:02.91]I can't even walk by this guy?
[489:06.71]You're not making it easy.
[489:15.92]Kick him off.
[489:18.18]Kick!
[489:19.04]Do an emote!
[489:25.22]Can you do mid-ear?
[489:28.59]It doesn't look like a lot of bosses around here.
[489:30.15]Let me see.
[489:32.03]Last one crashed the game pretty hard, so... Can I kill that guy by jumping on him?
[489:44.04]Let's see if Midir's here.
[489:48.71]Midir!
[489:52.49]His mimic is on here somehow.
[490:13.45]That's scary.
[490:14.13]That's really scary.
[490:27.22]Crystal lizard.
[490:28.06]Let's see if we can find mid-ear.
[490:31.11]Oh, here's a vort.
[490:32.99]Here's a boss.
[490:55.09]Well, I should be able to make it to the Deacons like this.
[490:57.14]The same bridge.
[491:08.26]It's too hard to cross it.
[491:10.60]There's too much going on.
[491:11.88]You can't go over that bridge.
[491:16.89]What?
[491:19.97]Why did I become a fucking ant?
[491:27.35]That's way less intimidating.
[491:38.60]Tree frog.
[491:39.66]OK, reload.
[491:42.39]Let's do, OK, this board.
[491:47.05]A few more.

[492:27.81]That's a crash.
[492:29.55]Fuck.

[492:44.01]Boo, boo, boo.
[492:46.77]Do the skeleton?
[492:47.51]Maybe like, I'll do like a, watch your ears.

[496:07.23]I think I crashed it.
[496:08.53]Damn it.
[496:11.39]No, I think I'm alright.

[496:40.39]Thanks for watching Dark Souls 3 first person and extra just cheating.
[496:52.83]Thanks for watching the guy plays first person Dark Souls 3 then cheats for an hour.
[497:00.28]You forgot all the mods at once.
[497:02.96]You know what?
[497:03.42]I'll give it to you.
[497:03.94]I'm going to give you all the mods at once and I'm going to try to beat the game.
[497:17.43]Let's give it a whirl.
[497:28.32]Fall joke incoming.

[497:46.19]No, it's opening.
[497:47.07]We're good.
[497:50.78]This guy is addicted to Dark Souls.

[498:50.33]Oh, that just makes me... Okay, never mind.
[498:52.61]Speed modifier.
[498:54.61]Activated.
[499:08.88]How fast?
[499:18.28]That's way too fast.
[499:28.74]Okay.
[499:29.78]Looks good.
[499:31.73]Lighting modifier.
[499:34.35]We're going with this one.
[499:35.89]Okay, no, not that one.
[499:36.93]That just makes the whole thing dark.
[499:44.39]Make it really dark?
[499:51.16]I don't want to do that.
[499:56.04]Brightness.
[499:58.07]Oh, there's a glow.
[499:58.81]What the hell does glow do?
[499:59.89]This makes everything glowy?
[500:08.42]I don't understand what this one does.
[500:13.00]No, that's just your eyes hurt simulator.
[500:21.98]Just more bloom.
[500:25.04]Alright.
[500:26.08]We've got...

[500:39.57]Aggression mod is on.
[500:44.92]So that's on.
[500:47.18]They all are going to have red eyes, apparently.

[501:42.27]I'm ready.
[501:43.99]You ready?
[501:44.35]You ready for me to beat the game in 20 minutes?
[501:51.08]Let's go!
[502:20.93]Faster, I can't go faster or I'll end up in a wall somewhere.
[502:35.01]Faster!
[502:35.67]Faster!
[502:42.71]I could probably do it faster.
[502:44.53]Hold on to your hats.
[502:45.16]If you get motion sick very easily, I'm going to warn you right now, you're going to puke.
[502:51.18]You will throw up from this, so just be careful.
[502:54.46]Minimize the window a little bit if you need to.
[503:00.66]Speed modifier, there it is.
[503:12.08]What's wrong with this guy?
[503:27.26]Here we go.
[503:29.16]Time to fucking puke!
[503:50.65]I'm gonna beat the whole game without stopping moving.
[504:24.31]What is that?
[504:25.45]Oh, it's, okay, it's those guys, okay.
[504:30.09]That guy is still on fire and he's still running over here.
[504:42.56]Stop?
[504:42.88]No I didn't, I just turned.
[504:59.21]let's go
[505:27.01]It's because my character is two feet tall.
[505:29.31]Please stop.
[505:38.79]You need to restart.
[506:10.66]This is taking too long.
[506:11.84]It's because of the Deacons.
[506:17.36]Okay, okay!
[506:18.00]Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[507:08.63]I don't know where to go I have no idea
[507:40.68]I feel bad for anybody that's coming to the stream that has never seen this game before.
[507:44.51]They're probably just like, thanks for ruining the whole game.
[509:03.36]How do I get these spells on my character?
[509:58.11]I didn't know if the speed or something was going to fuck up and not let me out.
[510:06.97]The game, just, that's it.
[510:08.13]That's it.
[510:08.47]Goodbye.
[510:09.81]Game crashed.
[510:10.65]For real.
[510:12.39]Does it skip?
[510:12.83]I just didn't know if I could just, whatever.
[510:16.35]That's it.
[510:21.11]Ugh!
[510:22.63]That was mentally draining.
[510:27.25]That was a lot of fun.
[510:29.13]But holy shit, that was just too much stimulation.
[510:32.66]Too much Abyss Watchers.
[510:35.20]Too much first person.
[510:43.95]That was a lot of fun.
[510:47.89]But!
[510:49.65]Those of you that are still around, we're gonna do the bits.
[510:52.48]That was Dark Souls 3 with some mods.
[510:56.56]The challenge mods, more specifically.
[511:07.03]And I will see you guys.
[511:08.45]I'm not going to be live tomorrow.
[511:12.27]Well, tomorrow as in today because it's currently 12.30 a.m.
[511:15.05]on Sunday.
[511:21.31]So no stream on Sunday.
[511:26.50]I will be back.
[511:29.12]And we will do... We're gonna finally do some Dreamcast stuff on Monday.
[511:34.04]Or I might do Lifeline.
[511:36.35]There's just so many options.
[511:37.39]There's so many fun fucking things to do.
[511:42.33]And then 23rd, we've got the duct tape goalie stream.
[511:48.76]Shenmue.
[511:49.68]Oh, I got... This is too many things.
[511:52.47]But thanks for joining me.
[511:53.29]See you guys next time.
[511:56.67]And we're going to go back and do the bits from eight and a half hour stream.
[512:03.59]I wonder how much of it was actually on the Abyss Watchers.
[512:09.60]Probably at least two hours.
[512:17.12]Rift Dogma?
[512:17.78]No, we'll go back to that.
[512:20.87]I will absolutely go back to Dragon's Dogma.
[512:26.45]So, let's rifle through these bits.
[512:30.25]Manboy, thanks for the $1.
[512:31.23]You've been trying to get a hold of Shido, but he's blocked my phone calls.
[512:35.23]I'm sorry to hear that.
[512:37.08]He didn't have his cell phone.
[512:37.80]I don't know where he got it.
[512:40.14]Timmy Timtan, thanks for the $1.
[512:42.58]Binaryman, thanks for the $5.
[512:46.62]Hey Jeremy, here's a music video I made for you.
[512:48.40]This file has been scanned with binary anti-gnome system.
[512:52.18]No gnomes have been detected.
[513:01.33]Somebody's falling down on a scooter.
[513:08.52]I have no idea what that is.
[513:10.31]But thank you for the video, nonetheless.
[513:13.05]Thank you for the $5, BinaryMan.
[513:14.57]Thank you for not gnoming me, although I'm not sure what that was.
[513:18.03]Alec, thanks for the $1.
[513:18.85]Dark Souls 3 was my first Dark Souls game, and it's also my favorite one.
[513:22.54]It's very good.
[513:24.54]Hey, BinaryMan, thanks for the $5.
[513:25.58]Hey, it's me again.
[513:26.80]Not a music video, but haha, anyways.
[513:29.70]Is it gonna be a gnome, probably?
[513:30.76]Because you said it wasn't a gnome last time.
[513:34.97]It's a bunch of farts, okay.
[513:38.39]Thank you for the $5 binary, man.
[513:39.85]Thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[513:42.64]The $1?
[513:46.46]Bake me home, thanks for the $1.
[513:48.44]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[513:49.88]Did you know that it's been almost three years since your first Dark Souls 3 stream?
[513:55.35]I think you played it in, like, March or April of 2016.
[513:57.97]It has been a long time.
[514:05.85]It is a great game.
[514:07.40]Thank you Divus for the $2.
[514:08.42]Dreambin, thank you for the $11.50.
[514:11.21]Are you the streamer that beat The Simpsons hit and run on stream?
[514:17.65]I am.
[514:20.21]I am that guy.
[514:24.46]I'm aware of that.
[514:26.66]There's a badge on my sleeve.
[514:30.38]They stole your urinal idea already.
[514:33.12]That's not even it.
[514:35.85]But thank you for the nearly $12, Breenbin.
[514:38.33]Hey, Pin, thanks for the $1.
[514:39.90]Action Wheel, we meet again, Jeremy.
[514:43.50]Action Wheel.
[514:49.29]Hey, Jack, thanks for the $1.
[514:50.73]Keldos, thanks for the $1.
[514:53.91]Smell the... I'm not even going to read that.
[514:55.63]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $10.
[514:59.40]I need to clear the air since I wasn't around to defend myself last night.
[515:03.04]I don't think Shido is a bad character.
[515:05.07]I think he's great.
[515:06.77]I've been framed.
[515:07.67]I'm an innocent man, I tell you.
[515:08.71]You've got to believe me.
[515:09.43]I can't live my life on the run.
[515:12.53]No, you never said anything bad about Shido.
[515:13.97]We were just kidding around.
[515:19.54]Thank you for the $10.
[515:21.44]Shido has... There's no ill will there, don't worry.
[515:24.48]Frodean weapon, thank you.
[515:28.08]Uh, thank you Dr. Epic Frag for the $1.
[515:31.70]Try finger in... Yep, thank you.
[515:33.70]Hey Future Gamer, thanks for the $1.
[515:36.28]It's a VR version for the first person mod.
[515:38.46]There is a VR version for the first person mod.
[515:43.04]How would you even... Ugh.
[515:47.64]That'd be so horrible.
[515:50.93]Hey, Bitslave, thanks for the $1.
[515:52.31]Jeremy, it's my birthday tomorrow.
[515:53.65]I'm drunk, drinking with my airmen.
[515:56.15]Eat my... Why would you write this?
[515:58.25]Eat my... They say you're a cool man.
[516:00.77]Thank you.
[516:02.49]C4G, thanks for the $1.
[516:04.97]Mercywing, jermaMoon, Mercywing.
[516:09.37]Seems pretty good.
[516:11.35]The Shrubman, thanks for the $15, Shrubman.
[516:15.86]No message, just cheer, 1500 bits.
[516:18.20]Thank you so much.
[516:21.21]For the $15.
[516:21.93]Thank you, Bitslave, again, for the $1.
[516:23.35]Check this picture out.
[516:29.65]What the fuck?
[516:37.81]Uh... Thank you... No message, what a guy.
[516:44.50]No, no, no, I'm just saying, like, thank you for the $15.
[516:47.12]It's a lot of money.
[516:51.35]What is it?
[516:51.73]It's a picture of... He's got like a perhaps blue ribbon 24 pack on his head.
[516:56.33]I don't know.
[516:58.31]I'm not gonna... If you want to share that image, you can.
[516:59.95]I don't want to share that.
[517:06.98]Uh, thank you... Nitsu Kitty for the $5.
[517:11.46]Message deleted.
[517:12.18]Nah, just kidding.
[517:13.66]Loving the stream.
[517:14.22]Take some bitty booze.
[517:15.44]Thank you, Kitty.
[517:20.99]Thank you so much for the $5.
[517:23.31]Skully P. Skully P gave a shitload of subs.
[517:26.15]Seabear gave a bunch of community subs.
[517:27.65]You guys are fucking awesome.
[517:28.51]Thank you.
[517:31.09]There's so many of you guys.
[517:32.76]Our major community subcontributions.
[517:35.34]Contributors.
[517:36.42]It's ridiculous.
[517:39.84]Shocking.
[517:41.24]Some of the numbers you guys have.
[517:45.34]Thank you, Novi, for the $3.33.
[517:46.20]Praise the jermaSun.
[517:46.78]Sometimes.
[517:47.02]Sometimes.
[517:52.05]Thank you DoubleD for the $1.
[517:53.39]Is this the streamer that didn't beat Midir?
[517:56.41]I didn't.
[517:58.23]But I also had three other friends come and help me, and they couldn't beat him either.
[518:03.25]You saw that stream.
[518:07.79]Hey Meme Machine, thanks for the $4, Meme Machine.
[518:12.38]Tingy, thanks for $1.
[518:13.32]Can I get a large soda too, stupid?
[518:18.10]Hey, welcome to McDonald's.
[518:19.06]How can I help you?
[518:20.23]Hey, yeah, um, could you make me a number one with large fry, idiot?
[518:26.61]Well, I... Thank you, Ting.
[518:31.05]Thank you, Ting, for the one.
[518:31.69]What if I were to go to McDonald's drive-thru and use your voice from the clip I shared to make my order?
[518:36.56]Would that be okay?
[518:39.24]No.
[518:40.68]That would never be okay.
[518:44.57]Thank you for the $1.23.
[518:46.05]Quick rhyme.
[518:46.81]Just tuned in.
[518:47.39]This is incredible.
[518:48.21]It was very interesting.
[518:50.18]It was a lot of fun.
[518:50.86]And then I hit the wall.
[518:51.72]I can't wait to see all the comments.
[518:53.52]When I hit the wall, everybody telling me, Jerma, take a break.
[518:56.06]Jerma, you're losing your mind.
[518:57.10]Jerma, come on, man.
[518:58.64]Like, do something else.
[519:01.63]I know that's going to happen.
[519:02.71]It's coming.
[519:04.89]Thank you, though.
[519:05.31]Quick rhyme for the $1.23.
[519:06.57]Thank you to Uncouth Badger for the $1.
[519:12.85]Thank you.
[519:18.53]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the one dollar.
[519:19.95]My automaton came in yesterday and I've decided in honor of Shito to name him Nito.
[519:28.34]Nito.
[519:31.32]That's a pretty good name.
[519:34.40]Uh, docking with friends, thanks for the two dollars.
[519:37.08]Smelly boy, thanks for the one dollar.
[519:38.44]Proof of Shito now.
[519:41.64]Shito doesn't move.
[519:44.99]Shito's always in the same spot, sleeping.
[519:50.65]A Sharplian, Sharplion, thanks for the $13.
[519:53.87]Hey Jeremy, just want to say you're my favorite YouTuber and probably the only one who consistently makes me laugh even when I'm down.
[520:01.72]Thanks for being a hunk in game and in real life.
[520:06.30]Sneakman for Jermania 2019.
[520:07.54]Thank you so much, Sharplion.
[520:16.44]I'm honored to be your favorite YouTuber.
[520:22.13]Although I don't necessarily make a bunch of YouTube videos anymore.
[520:26.04]Still surprising that people still say that same thing.
[520:29.62]It's very... Very humbling to me.
[520:32.96]I'm... I'm fucking honored.
[520:35.06]Thank you.
[520:36.42]All these years later.
[520:39.53]Double D thanks for the $1.
[520:40.75]Jerma, please stop swearing.
[520:41.79]I'm gonna be grounded for like a month if you keep this up.
[520:44.49]I'm using my family computer, by the way.
[520:47.51]Also, do you want to come over to my house for a sleepover and play Minecraft?
[520:50.74]My mom says we can stay up until 10.
[520:57.13]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $1.
[520:59.83]Sad Vega, thanks for the $1.
[521:01.13]Jeremy, you're such a good chuckle to watch, as always.
[521:03.53]Really glad you put up with our shitposting.
[521:06.47]The fact you read all these bit donations off at the end is crazy.
[521:10.15]I almost wonder if I could buy, like, $100 worth of bits and make you read off the start of a novel.
[521:15.23]You may not want to read that part.
[521:16.70]Someone may actually do it.
[521:25.40]Don't do that.
[521:30.84]Too Chunky To Eat, thanks for the $10, Too Chunky.
[521:36.56]Yo, Jerma, just like you know, just like you to know, that you're amazing and lighting up my day with your streams.
[521:45.68]$10.
[521:47.68]Just a very, very nice, wonderful thing to say to somebody.
[521:52.28]Thank you so much, Too Chunky.
[521:59.35]It means a lot, thank you.
[522:01.60]Thank you, The Jewish Bro, for the $1.
[522:03.12]Could you play Fallout 3 modded?
[522:06.84]Maybe.
[522:08.01]Maybe, but... I need to, like, just relax and play... Putt-Putt's Bizarre Adventure.
[522:19.34]Hey, FGW, thanks for the $1.
[522:20.80]Jerma, thank God it's you.
[522:21.62]He has my family.
[522:24.30]don't don't read this he's gonna make them die to Pinwheel on stream whatever what mandem requiem thanks for the two dollars Freudian weapon thanks for the two dollars chicken foot thanks for the one dollar PogChamp is calling the McDonald's drive-thru clerk a waifu or an idiot the official Jerma985 challenge
[522:49.64]No, don't do that.
[522:51.04]Don't.
[522:52.20]I was telling you not to do that because if I'm ridiculous, it would be to even remotely attempt to do that.
[522:57.99]I don't want that to be, that's not the Jerma985 challenge.
[523:01.85]You know what the Jerma985 challenge would be?
[523:04.93]When you get your food at the window, give them a $5 bill as a tip.
[523:10.49]How's that for a challenge?
[523:24.17]What if they don't accept tips?
[523:26.09]Then you go, oh, well, are you sure?
[523:28.69]Oh, okay, well, and then you grab your food and drive.
[523:36.18]Hey, thank you, Overdramatic Toast, for the $5.
[523:38.02]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to give some bits for all the laughs you've given my friends and I for the last seven years.
[523:43.80]From TF2 Commentaries to Jerma Rumbles, thanks, man, we're all lucky to have you.
[523:47.74]P.S., give my bestie Nick and Johnny a good beer.
[523:53.01]Uh-oh.
[523:53.55]Fucking baby beer.
[523:58.27]Baby beer peed his diaper.
[524:21.48]Thank you, Overdramatic Tells for the $5.
[524:23.12]Thank you, Mandragora Root for the $5.02.
[524:26.19]They just say Pride 502.
[524:29.39]Thank you.
[524:32.45]P-Joke.
[524:32.89]He said P. He said P in diaper.
[524:35.64]Cross it off the list of things I say every stream.
[524:38.02]Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer.
[524:39.20]Thanks for the $1.
[524:39.88]Hey there, Jerma.
[524:40.38]Listen up.
[524:41.88]It's Garfagraph time.
[524:42.90]Bring all your pups.
[524:44.68]I'm talking Otto, Young Soy, and Francis too.
[524:47.90]He's the first member of the GK crew.
[524:51.18]GK.
[524:51.70]Garfy Kong.
[524:52.86]Garfy Kong is here.
[524:53.80]He's got no style.
[524:54.68]He's got no grace.
[524:56.18]This dog's got a funny face.
[524:57.51]He can float real high and jump from trees.
[524:59.99]He eats dog food and kicks bad guys' knees.
[525:02.31]He's Odie.
[525:03.55]Odie and Odie too.
[525:04.25]He's the second member of the GK crew.
[525:06.45]Huh.
[525:06.71]I rapped too long and now there's no more Garfagraph left.
[525:09.11]Oops.
[525:14.37]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer.
[525:18.53]DoorCube, thanks for the $1.
[525:19.87]We all know that the Abyss Watchers are tough, but we know you can do it, and if anybody asks us, we'll tell them what a great job you're doing.
[525:27.09]You hear that?
[525:27.57]A great job.
[525:28.31]I didn't do it, though.
[525:29.17]On first person, I did it in regular mode.
[525:39.15]Not even the power of a great job could help.
[525:44.01]I may as well have been sitting upside down at that last point when I tried it on invisible man mode.
[525:51.42]I was upside down.
[525:52.20]I was hanging upside down.
[525:56.16]Hey Jules, thanks for the three dollars.
[525:57.52]Hey Jeremy, yesterday you answered my question saying that your favorite supervillain is Thanos and that your favorite superhero is Carnage.
[526:03.80]I couldn't find anything from the internet that Carnage was a superhero at one point.
[526:06.90]Can you enlighten me?
[526:07.70]Thanks, man.
[526:09.68]No, I said Carnage was my favorite super person.
[526:19.03]Superhero, probably Spider-Man.
[526:21.59]It just probably would be.
[526:24.43]Hey, Pugatron, thanks for the $15.
[526:26.47]There's no message here, but thank you for $15.
[526:29.44]It's a lot of fucking money.
[526:32.14]Some of you guys give $15 almost every single stream, and it adds up to a lot of money.
[526:38.96]Thank you.
[526:40.99]That is... fucking wonderful to hear.
[526:41.97]Absolutely wonderful.
[527:10.81]If anything that I say can help you out, that's life-changing for me.
[527:20.15]It blows me away.
[527:25.55]Thank you so much for being around.
[527:26.77]If the stuff that I say can help you out in your life,
[527:34.88]I mean, I'm no professional.
[527:38.11]I'm not qualified to really give advice.
[527:45.67]But it does feel good to know that somebody's happier because of it.
[527:49.62]I'm glad you're doing good.
[527:52.02]Thank you.
[527:53.82]For real.
[527:58.70]Good luck to you.
[528:12.71]Much love to you.
[528:14.91]Here, here.
[528:15.33]I still got, like, a little bit of wine in this glass.
[528:18.15]Cheers.
[528:19.15]Cheers to you.
[528:24.80]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the one dollar.
[528:28.02]Jerma, your doctor calling is worried about you.
[528:30.46]You should really take a break from games that boil your blood.
[528:33.08]It's not good for your heart.
[528:34.06]Remember that you have a pacemaker, jermaOld.
[528:36.44]I told you it was coming.
[528:44.13]Well, that's... I'm glad that they did that.
[528:45.31]I'm glad you got your money back.
[528:46.25]Just messing around, you're the best.
[528:47.17]Thank you, FGW.
[529:18.12]I did it the first time when I had no invisibility and no first person.
[529:25.57]I did it the first time I went in there.
[529:30.41]I'm so itchy knowing that I didn't beat that in first person.
[529:35.95]I was locked in.
[529:37.15]I had to beat it in first person.
[529:40.68]And then I lost all control.
[529:42.98]Well, not really.
[529:44.22]It was still fun.
[529:46.04]I wouldn't have kept going in there if it wasn't.
[529:50.49]But thank you, NotVega, for the $5.
[529:52.09]Just PogChamp.
[529:55.49]SirTardigrad, thanks for the $1.
[529:57.43]Hey, Jerma, today my friends all made plans to smash.
[530:01.04]No.
[530:05.56]Hey, Jerma, today my friends all made plans to play Smash.
[530:09.93]Ugh.
[530:14.49]I'm sorry.
[530:15.09]I'm fucking stupid.
[530:16.07]Why would they do that?
[530:18.13]What's up with that?
[530:18.85]Why'd they do that?
[530:44.03]Is it a... Wait, hold on.
[530:44.95]Is it a scenario where... You're really damn good?
[530:56.08]Like, they're all playing Fox?
[530:58.14]Because they heard it was good?
[530:59.58]And you're playing as, like, Olimar and just stomping him?
[531:09.89]Yeah, but if people don't want to play a game with you and hang out with you, that's...
[531:13.94]That's not fucking cool, man.
[531:21.88]Is Olimar top tier in the ultimate?
[531:23.86]Really?
[531:27.12]Maybe I'm too good.
[531:28.29]I do stomp.
[531:34.59]Well, I would say we're glad to have you.
[531:43.19]Glad to have you watch me, uh, have a fucking stream meltdown at First Person Abyss Watchers for like an hour and a half.
[531:55.67]But, for real, if, uh, if people want to exclude you from playing a game and hanging out with them for some reason, maybe reconsider who they are.
[532:09.91]Maybe reconsider some friendships.
[532:12.17]Because that doesn't seem very, very cool.
[532:19.17]But, I wish you luck.
[532:20.05]Thank you.
[532:22.40]Thank you, Suspicious Lettuce, for the $10.
[532:24.18]It's nice to see some of you stream.
[532:26.10]It's always a treat in Europe.
[532:28.56]Thank you, Suspicious Lettuce, for the $10.
[532:29.82]And the European message.
[532:37.42]Oh, I get it.
[532:37.68]I understand how you want it.
[532:38.34]That's why.
[532:38.64]This is smooth.
[533:10.32]And there we are.
[533:15.27]Too bad.
[533:15.67]I thought you guys wanted me to fight him.
[533:18.77]Hey, Plastic Glue, thanks for the $1.
[533:21.49]Tingy for $1.
[533:22.47]Baby Biaf for Jerma Rumble.
[533:25.07]Maybe.
[533:25.37]I don't think so.
[533:26.40]Doomed RS, thanks for the $1.
[533:27.72]Put a link in my last donation, but a nightbot killed it since I wasn't subbed.
[533:31.52]I'm a subscriber now.
[533:33.74]Welcome to the subs.
[533:34.94]Anyway, you mentioned Andre at max speed.
[533:36.50]Oh, we got it.
[533:37.14]No, we got it.
[533:37.82]We did get it.
[533:39.80]Because I get to save on... I get to save every message that comes through.
[533:47.15]Please link.
[533:47.87]Here's the link.
[533:54.31]Thank you, Doomed, for the $2.
[533:56.91]And finally, IamMonk, thanks for the $1.
[533:58.67]I'm trying to get over being an alcoholic in your streams and community is something I can't get through with this without.
[534:04.15]I love you all.
[534:06.11]Dermaheart.
[534:12.05]Good luck.
[534:14.29]Keep your head up.
[534:17.43]That's the wrong link.
[534:20.05]What is that a link to?
[534:26.48]I fucked it up, whatever.
[534:28.54]But I am Monk.
[534:30.67]You get all the support in the world from me and this community.
[534:42.05]Take care of yourself.
[534:44.55]One step at a time.
[534:45.29]Good luck.
[534:53.13]You got a whole community here.
[535:02.32]Thank you for the $1.
[535:02.78]And thanks for being around.
[535:08.92]Finally, finally Clueless Sniper with $1 at the very end.
[535:16.66]Thank you, Clueless Sniper.
[535:20.02]And it wouldn't be the end of a stream without the credits, so let's see all those subs.
[535:26.68]Flying on by.
[535:31.33]Finish the stream with an English lesson, of course we will.
[535:40.56]We eat a lot.
[535:42.96]Did you see my car keys?
[535:44.36]They're on top of the TV.
[535:45.92]You're right.
[535:46.90]Thanks.
[535:47.50]Where are you going?
[535:48.56]To the supermarket.
[535:49.56]Again?
[535:50.54]Yes.
[535:51.27]We eat a lot.
[535:52.37]Do you want me to go with you?
[535:53.77]Sure, if you can.
[535:54.93]Good.
[535:55.43]The packages will be heavy.
[535:56.95]There is a new health store right up the road.
[535:58.89]Maybe since you guys eat a lot, you should try and eat more healthily.
[536:02.39]Maybe you're right.
[536:03.59]We have all put on a little weight.
[536:06.53]Who puts their keys on?
[536:07.53]I know.
[536:07.79]Why would you put your keys on top of the TV?
[536:13.72]But there was a lot of people here.
[536:15.20]There was almost 4,000 people here up until about midnight Pacific time.
[536:21.14]Thanks for sticking around.
[536:22.88]The stream has fucking grown so much, I can't even believe it.
[536:36.91]Looking over at like 11.30, 12 o'clock Pacific time and seeing a number like 4,000.
[536:44.43]It's crazy to me.
[536:45.73]Thank you, guys.
[536:58.87]And I will see you all again really soon.
[537:03.91]Specifically on Monday for either for either Lifeline for PlayStation 2, which is a microphone-controlled game
[537:15.51]Or... Back to Dragon's Dogma.
[537:18.61]Or... Dreamcast.
[537:21.01]Or... That's pretty much it.
[537:30.60]He will continue to push Dreamcast.
[537:43.93]Dreamcast has been in the works since Monster Hunter 3's stream.
[537:46.19]I've owned it since the Monster Hunter 3 streams.
[537:51.29]But I ran into some nonsense with it.
[537:55.74]I talked about it last stream, but we'll bring it up while the credits play out here.
[538:00.32]Dreamcast games are insanely expensive.
[538:03.12]They're very rare, and a lot of the good ones are somewhere around $100 each.
[538:11.73]All the classic games have been ported to PC.
[538:17.59]And on top of that, there is emulation, but emulators are very unreliable.
[538:24.69]So capturing an emulator and playing on Dreamcast's emulator is really not ideal.
[538:31.58]Did you get Power Stone?
[538:32.30]I do have Power Stone.
[538:34.96]I got a couple of the really, really good, interesting survival horror games that were only on Dreamcast.
[538:41.50]Power Stone, Dynamite Cop, which is one of my favorite arcade games ever.
[538:55.62]There are some options, but stuff like Shenmue and Crazy Taxi and Space Channel 5, they're all on PC.
[539:02.36]Shenmue and Shenmue 2 got ported to PC.
[539:05.73]Not even like six months ago.
[539:07.64]So it's like, eh.
[539:09.78]Do you spend a bunch of money on the Dreamcast version that's not even in 1080 or 720p?
[539:16.12]Or get the updated ported PC one and play that instead.
[539:27.17]But that's gonna be it.
[539:28.79]Thank you for joining me.
[539:29.67]I had a lot of fun.
[539:32.63]As much as I went into pure fucking streamer meltdown mode, I didn't.
[539:38.56]I didn't.
[539:38.90]I still was having a good time.
[539:40.10]Even though I was talking about how hard it was, I still had a lot of fun.
[539:48.24]You guys rock.
[539:49.24]See you guys on Monday.
[539:50.02]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[539:52.40]Take care of yourselves.
[539:54.34]See you very soon.
[540:04.84]Thank you.
