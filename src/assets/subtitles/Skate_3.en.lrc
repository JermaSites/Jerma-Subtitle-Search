[01:02.73]Got you, I scared you.
[01:03.53]I saw you punch back in your chair.
[01:08.57]Hello.
[01:12.25]Got you with a boo.
[01:14.61]Close this.
[01:17.81]Hello.
[01:18.33]Whoa.
[01:22.73]Whoa.
[01:27.49]Right off the bat, my best hat with 50 bucks, 5,000 bits, they say...
[01:36.41]Thank you for the years of content, fun, and uncontrollable laughter.
[01:40.05]I've been here for long enough to know you're not just a good entertainer, but a good person as well.
[01:45.56]As an EMT, the joy you bring me is so helpful to offset how awful things can sometimes be, keep your chin up, and all the best to you.
[01:52.86]No matter what you choose to do next, we'll be with you every step of the way.
[01:56.77]Time to enjoy my daily dose of vitamin J.
[02:01.27]Well, that's extremely kind of you.
[02:03.19]That's a very nice thing to say.
[02:04.45]That's cool that you're an EMT.
[02:06.91]So does that mean if I have a heart attack on stream, you're going to come save me?
[02:12.43]You're going to get in your EMT mobile?
[02:16.38]Like if I'm like, oh shit, I'm having a heart attack.
[02:19.06]You're going to get in your car and you're going to get down here in like 20 minutes, right?
[02:24.10]But yeah, thank you, my best hat.
[02:26.92]I'm very glad to have you around.
[02:29.76]So, much love.
[02:31.19]Thank you for the $50.
[02:31.83]I'll get my medical jet.
[02:40.39]I like vitamin J. I've never been called that before.
[02:44.52]And Todd again.
[02:45.56]Todd has given.
[02:48.04]Todd he knows.
[02:50.62]Over the course of the last month and a half...
[02:53.75]I see Todd's name just like, he's throwing around money.
[02:55.73]500, 100, 500, 200, 500.
[02:56.91]Todd, you're up there right now.
[03:00.91]With the amount of money you've given.
[03:02.97]So thanks, man.
[03:04.69]You scared me so hard, I shit someone else's pants.
[03:12.31]And thank you also to 8Rabbits.
[03:15.73]That's nine months up.
[03:17.99]Rayburn, what's going on?
[03:18.81]Two months stream hype, that's right.
[03:21.79]So here's what's going to happen today.
[03:24.40]I'm going to give you the long and short of it.
[03:28.16]We are obviously very early.
[03:32.18]We're also going to end very early, too, because I have a yet unannounced, well, not really unannounced, I don't really want to talk about it, but I have a family thing to go to later tonight.
[03:44.67]It's kind of something I can't miss out on.
[03:48.43]Nothing's bad, by the way.
[03:49.17]It's not like, oh, something bad didn't happen.
[03:50.81]Wait, what?
[03:52.39]I just need to, I got to go, you know?
[03:57.29]Yeah, it's a date with my family.
[04:00.03]So we're only going to stream here for probably a couple hours.
[04:03.80]But, but, here's the kicker.
[04:07.14]I'm going to be live tomorrow.
[04:08.38]That's right, off schedule tomorrow.
[04:09.48]We're going to pick up on Skate 3.
[04:12.04]Depending on how much fun I have tonight or today.
[04:15.16]Who knows?
[04:16.58]But, without further ado, thanks guys for coming in.
[04:27.76]I'm not getting married.
[04:28.62]No.
[04:29.50]No.
[04:32.44]It's just a family get-together, and it's important where I can't be like, no, I'm not going.
[04:38.49]And it was something that I didn't know was happening until today.
[04:41.65]So that's how we're going to take it.
[04:43.77]And thank you to 80% Lean, Mech, Mechir117, Wheel of Sarcasm, again, for seven months.
[04:51.95]Thank you, Louie the Cashew, for ten months.
[04:56.00]And, of course, Mitzi700.
[04:56.87]And, of course.
[04:58.17]And, of course.
[04:59.25]Thanks for two months, Mitzi.
[05:00.77]Yeah.
[05:02.49]I seem like a genuine dude.
[05:03.59]Well, I'm just me.
[05:05.13]I only know how to be me.
[05:06.59]I don't know how to be anybody else.
[05:09.01]That's kind of you to say.
[05:11.01]And then, Azanazandrew.
[05:14.37]Azandrew.
[05:15.76]Thank you.
[05:18.76]Thank you also to Bombodongo.
[05:22.28]Jack the Lad for two months.
[05:23.37]Love you, buddy.
[05:23.73]Keep up the great work.
[05:25.99]I'm going to try.
[05:27.65]I'm going to try.
[05:29.69]All right, let's get going.
[05:30.93]We're going to play Skate 3.
[05:31.99]I have never played this game before in my whole life.
[05:35.13]There's only one thing I know about it is it can get crazy.
[05:38.71]This is just blind.
[05:39.57]I have no idea what's in this game.
[05:44.52]I know that it's fun.
[05:45.32]That's all I know.
[05:47.92]Can you guys hear it?
[05:49.12]Let's see.
[05:51.14]Yes, you can.
[05:52.63]I've got to make my character, by the way.
[05:54.49]That's important.
[05:56.81]Move this to there.
[06:00.69]We're the only family you need.
[06:03.92]I'm going to make my character again because I didn't really spend any time on it.
[06:08.74]Where do I do that?
[06:10.96]Edit skaters.
[06:11.56]Here we go.
[06:13.76]It's a big learning curve.
[06:15.04]I mean, I took at least 20 minutes off stream before I started here to kind of get used to the controls and stuff.
[06:22.76]But we'll find out how much I suck.
[06:24.20]It's probably going to be bad.
[06:26.10]But, you know.
[06:28.91]We have to make this guy.
[06:31.95]Body mods.
[06:33.09]Male.
[06:34.13]Hair.
[06:34.47]Let's go with the hair first.
[06:36.53]Okay, already done.
[06:38.57]Body shape.
[06:39.51]Absolutely.
[06:40.01]Haste to be a fat guy.
[06:40.79]There's no other way around it.
[06:43.11]Facial presets.
[06:44.11]No.
[06:45.71]Face modification.
[06:46.71]Eyes.
[06:47.29]Yeah, I already did this a little bit.
[06:52.63]God, it does look like me.
[06:55.29]It actually looks like me.
[06:57.93]No, it doesn't.
[06:58.51]Does that?
[06:58.85]I don't even know.
[07:03.01]Am I that fucked up looking?
[07:04.03]Probably.
[07:06.66]Let's go with that.
[07:07.42]I'm not going to spend too much time here.
[07:14.96]By the way, the music is turned down a little bit, so...
[07:18.70]The in-game audio is not turned down, so it shouldn't be that low.
[07:23.75]Unfortunately, I might have to turn the music completely and totally off.
[07:28.37]Because, you know, copyright reasons if I ever do a stream highlight on this or something.
[07:41.45]Okay, he just looks like a pancake.
[07:45.16]He's gonna have like tiny lips.
[07:49.79]Yeah, that's all I'm doing.
[07:55.71]That's fine.
[07:58.07]Accepted.
[08:00.53]Facial hair.
[08:04.54]Can you do a big beard?
[08:06.34]Oh, what?
[08:06.80]What's up with his eyelids?
[08:09.86]That's a good question.
[08:10.56]I don't know.
[08:12.68]Big beard.
[08:13.18]Upper body tattooed.
[08:14.50]Who cares?
[08:15.66]No tattoos.
[08:18.22]Merchandise hats.
[08:19.76]No, I want you to see his bald ass head.
[08:25.32]This is awful.
[08:27.36]This is like the fucking tomato shirt.
[08:32.24]No, nothing else but the tomato shirt.
[08:34.44]I don't even want anything else.
[08:37.42]I think I'm going to keep... Okay, and cargo pants.
[08:40.62]No.
[08:43.04]These are all locked.
[08:46.90]No, no.
[08:47.60]We're not going to have him be like Mr. Redman.
[08:52.29]Those shoes are fine.
[08:53.21]Okay, that's... No.
[08:59.89]Accessories, glasses, wrist, necklace, rings.
[09:02.67]Give him a couple of rings.
[09:04.47]Let people know he's married.
[09:05.49]I don't think I have unlocked... Yeah, I have nothing.
[09:11.42]Let's put the moose on it.
[09:16.50]on their right.
[09:17.82]Who gives a shit?
[09:19.80]Trucks?
[09:21.80]What the hell does trucks mean?
[09:25.66]Loose, medium, tight?
[09:28.89]For all you skateboard guys, what the hell does that mean?
[09:32.93]Loose trucks allow sharper turns, but wobble more?
[09:36.23]Okay, we're gonna keep these... We're gonna keep these just default, because I don't know what that's supposed to really mean.
[09:42.93]So...
[09:45.65]All your settings will be saved.
[09:46.55]Yes.
[09:47.83]Alright, let's play.
[09:49.29]We made our character.
[09:54.61]So, I don't really know what to do.
[09:57.13]I just know how to, like, move around.
[10:01.69]This is technically, I guess, still part of the tutorial.
[10:03.54]I might stay within 300 feet.
[10:07.04]I think I can do that.
[10:08.20]I'm pretty sure I can do that.
[10:10.26]I hope I can do that.
[10:13.46]Let me move this.
[10:15.59]Alright, let's go.
[10:18.49]Yes, I love this stupid game.
[10:20.03]Alright, I'm just gonna follow him, right?
[10:22.81]I think I have the basics down.
[10:24.49]I put the camera where it is.
[10:27.47]I gotta, like, follow his movements.
[10:28.81]I didn't do that.
[10:29.45]I didn't do it right.
[10:30.59]It's okay.
[10:33.46]Grind the rail.
[10:34.20]Nice.
[10:34.52]Good grind.
[10:36.64]Off to a great start.
[10:39.70]How's the audio?
[10:40.20]Is the audio too low?
[10:41.36]Should I turn the audio up?
[10:46.54]That was a fakie I Have an old skater man this guy's the oldest shit get out of the way That's so late oh Look I did it Turn the game audio up.
[11:05.97]Okay.
[11:06.23]That's yeah, I'll do that game settings audio oh
[11:12.88]How's that?
[11:13.22]Better?
[11:13.46]Maybe a little bit higher.
[11:20.51]How's that?
[11:23.19]Music might be a little too loud, but who cares?
[11:24.73]Ooh.
[11:27.49]I don't know why I keep holding that button down.
[11:38.43]Ooh, I got it.
[11:40.19]Hey, you guys thought I wasn't prepared for this game.
[11:41.91]You guys thought I was gonna jump into it.
[11:42.99]I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[11:45.75]What is he doing?
[11:50.24]Did I do it?
[11:50.86]Oh.
[11:51.34]I owned it.
[11:55.34]That was fucking easy.
[11:57.48]Trick off the bank.
[11:58.38]Time to get a photo of you in a trick.
[12:00.78]Any trick.
[12:01.46]Use the banked ledge.
[12:03.30]Okay.
[12:05.09]Sounds easy enough.
[12:05.59]He owned it.
[12:05.99]Do a trick.
[12:06.53]That's a good trick!
[12:07.45]I didn't even do anything.
[12:33.53]Oh, look at all those snapshots.
[12:34.81]Watch this.
[12:36.71]I just spread the butter on the toast.
[12:38.43]That's the name of that one.
[12:39.54]Oh, which photo do we want?
[12:45.72]Oh, this is kind of cool.
[12:48.32]More depth of field.
[12:49.18]More saturation.
[12:56.23]Like that.
[12:57.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[12:58.09]Hold on.
[12:58.25]Like that.
[12:58.79]Look at that one.
[13:01.93]That's going to be my default picture.
[13:03.33]That's going to be my sick pic that I took.
[13:07.75]Do I have a Snapchat?
[13:09.30]I do, but I don't ever use it.
[13:10.36]Yeah, I'm going to have to turn the music off, unfortunately.
[13:16.02]Because there's a lot of copywritten material.
[13:22.40]Yeah, Snapchat.
[13:23.81]Time to film a line skating a few obstacles.
[13:25.89]How about any trick and then a grind?
[13:27.91]Trick off the first ledge and then grind the second ledge.
[13:31.72]Sounds pretty easy.
[13:34.76]Alright.
[13:35.36]So what do I gotta do?
[13:41.10]Let me turn off the music.
[13:42.46]Unfortunately, we can't have the music.
[13:45.20]The sad world we live in needs to be at zero.
[13:49.33]Hopefully that did it.
[13:52.31]It did.
[13:53.19]We just have to have... All you can hear is my boring voice.
[13:55.43]That's it.
[13:55.71]Alright, trick on the first ledge, grind the second ledge.
[13:57.85]Easy.
[14:00.60]Let's just do like a default kickflip or something.
[14:03.22]And then we gotta grind this.
[14:08.52]I get the points, right?
[14:09.26]I win.
[14:11.94]First try.
[14:13.18]Look at this.
[14:14.50]Check out this vid.
[14:16.32]Can't wait to add a bunch of music to this and put a bunch of other tricks around it and have like a trick montage.
[14:20.59]Tight, tight, tight.
[14:31.24]Why are they not talking?
[14:33.10]Oh shit, I'm gonna have to fill this in.
[14:38.37]Who's the new guy?
[14:38.99]Yeah, the new guy.
[14:40.43]It's him.
[14:40.77]He's right here.
[14:41.29]His name's Dale.
[14:42.53]He's gonna be checking out around town now.
[14:44.25]He's gonna be around here now for the remainder of the season of the show.
[14:48.03]The show?
[14:49.55]He's not gonna be able to make it to the show.
[14:51.59]Look at him.
[14:52.97]Okay.
[14:56.07]Uh, the torch has been passed and you have a brand new filmer.
[15:00.27]Shingo is going to film you following Rita to the Chan Center.
[15:05.01]Okay.
[15:05.91]Stay within fucking 50 feet.
[15:08.83]Who am I following?
[15:09.69]Am I following this guy to the left?
[15:11.91]Who the fuck am I following?
[15:16.73]What?
[15:25.42]Is he in front of me now?
[15:26.74]Oh, you idiot.
[15:35.12]I forgot to retry it.
[15:37.07]I was doing the flip move.
[15:38.49]Alright, let's go.
[15:41.07]I'm ready.
[15:42.35]Will you please stop doing that?
[15:45.63]I understand what I'm supposed to be doing.
[15:50.84]This guy's a little more advanced.
[15:59.94]Easy.
[16:03.38]Trick sucks.
[16:05.94]I'm just learning the basics right now.
[16:07.16]That's all I'm doing.
[16:10.37]And we'll go up and around like... I just freaked the fuck out right there, but it's alright.
[16:15.65]It wasn't bad.
[16:16.21]It was okay.
[16:18.39]Well, you're a royalty-free punk rock.
[16:20.91]Go put on like royalty... Oh, shit.
[16:22.35]I didn't follow it.
[16:24.22]It's alright.
[16:25.30]I stuck it out.
[16:26.04]I'm good.
[16:30.13]Let's do a cool trick here.
[16:31.77]Like that.
[16:36.77]Did I beat it?
[16:38.37]I think I did.
[16:39.49]Now we have one more trick.
[16:40.21]We're going to jump over the freaking band-aid.
[16:41.66]I don't need to be holding A, but I feel like I need to for some reason.
[16:56.39]I need a new board.
[17:00.36]Alright, I can't wait to get out of this tutorial.
[17:02.60]So I can stop doing the little rabbit jumps that this guy wants me to keep doing over and over again.
[17:06.24]I'm gonna get it right up his ass.
[17:10.30]Oh, fuck!
[17:17.75]Get up!
[17:18.15]Get up!
[17:18.53]Get up!
[17:20.91]Okay.
[17:22.33]I owned it.
[17:22.77]Uh, rewards.
[17:26.87]I unlocked, uh, Rita?
[17:30.57]Damn, Shingo.
[17:31.89]This is... Now they have lines.
[17:34.48]Yo, check this out.
[17:35.50]Why don't you do all the filming for us while I run the brand?
[17:38.94]I'm gonna give you this camera, but first let me just tell you a couple of pointers.
[17:42.26]Number one, don't talk too much.
[17:44.00]People don't like that.
[17:45.30]Okay.
[17:45.66]Number two.
[17:48.75]Number two, make sure that when you zoom in, you actually zoom in on the guy.
[17:52.13]You understand?
[17:52.63]It's this button right here.
[17:55.25]Yeah, well, you know, if you were a fucking professional filmmaker like I am, you would understand it.
[18:00.12]So, last thing, uh... This ain't the last you're gonna hear of me.
[18:07.48]I'm gonna be keeping tabs on you guys.
[18:11.79]I know Retta said we gotta get to work, but I got the keys to the sick escape park.
[18:16.51]Why does it keep happening?
[18:17.33]We just gotta check it out, dude.
[18:22.37]Total bruises?
[18:23.94]It keeps track of how many times you've fallen down.
[18:27.68]Hey, check it out.
[18:29.02]This place is sick.
[18:31.18]Coach said we could build whatever we want in here.
[18:33.80]Dude, we could rebuild the entire park if we wanted to.
[18:37.18]Let me show you how it works.
[18:38.16]Yeah, he's got a shitty mic.
[18:42.18]You remember how to move stuff around, right?
[18:44.47]If you forgot, don't worry, because it's easy.
[18:46.59]Setting up objects, you can add a little drama to your coverage.
[18:49.35]See if you can find a dumpster to move between these ramps.
[18:52.63]And then air over the dumpster.
[18:55.21]Okay, put a session marker.
[18:56.19]Move the dumpster into position.
[18:58.50]Go to a session marker and air over the dumpster.
[19:02.04]Okay.
[19:03.12]So, how do I get a dumpster?
[19:05.38]Can I just grab shit?
[19:06.68]Okay, I gotta hold it.
[19:19.13]Okay, my guy's real fucking strong apparently.
[19:25.75]Get out of the way, dumpster!
[19:27.03]Get the fuck out of the way.
[19:30.83]Did I do it?
[19:31.35]I thought I just beat it.
[19:32.99]Oh shit, hold on.
[19:33.81]Okay.
[19:35.09]Now I just teleport to the marker.
[19:37.53]I just crushed myself against the wall.
[19:41.23]Okay, I crushed myself against the wall.
[19:42.69]Alright, check out this sick air I'm gonna do over the dumpster!
[19:48.55]Ooh!
[19:50.38]Alright, I got a feeling this is gonna be fun.

[35:14.79]I'm gonna lose again.
[35:17.11]No, I'm not.
[35:18.79]Just don't do anything stupid.
[35:22.57]Don't even do any tricks.
[35:23.47]Who cares?
[35:23.93]Just follow the line.
[35:27.77]There we are.
[35:33.40]Doing tricks is bad news.
[35:34.56]I got it.
[35:42.69]I'm fine.
[35:44.43]I nailed it.
[35:48.11]I bet Rob isn't even on TSM.

[35:50.72]I unlocked some stuff.
[35:56.62]Okay, so is that it?
[36:00.50]Rob wants me to do something else?
[36:03.10]What's the word, fellas?
[36:04.14]No, it's a different guy.
[36:05.28]This is the film guy.
[36:07.72]Hit these two ledges under the bridge.
[36:09.91]Kill it.
[36:10.43]Noseblunt the first ledge.
[36:16.31]Is somebody alright?
[36:17.65]Did you hear that?
[36:18.07]Sounds like somebody just fell down a flight of stairs.
[36:22.03]Okay, let's set a marker and we'll do this a few times.
[36:26.18]What's up, Kalis?
[36:27.98]Hey, what's up, Bobby Diesel?
[36:30.91]Who cares?
[36:32.53]Alright, grind the first ledge.
[36:37.69]What is a nose blunt?
[36:41.15]That's a pop shove it.
[36:43.49]That's another pop shove it.
[36:44.45]That's a heel flip.
[36:48.24]No.
[36:50.34]Just trying to figure it out.
[36:53.22]No.
[36:55.70]I can do it this way.
[36:57.50]No.
[36:58.98]I don't even know what that means.
[37:01.55]I have no clue.
[37:01.97]But we're just going to grind it.
[37:05.89]No, we're going to miss.
[37:07.55]We're just going to miss it.
[37:08.31]I'm going to put a marker.
[37:12.17]I forgot to do that.
[37:13.13]It's a grind trick?
[37:13.87]Oh, it's a grind trick.
[37:14.57]Okay.
[37:21.11]Let's go.
[37:25.45]Okay, that's a regular 50-50.
[37:33.40]Nope.
[37:35.64]I guess I did it, but... What, do you have to, like, do it... perpendicular?
[37:42.90]How boring was that?
[37:46.58]That's not a pro.
[37:47.34]I'm gonna retry.
[37:47.92]Yeah, let's go.
[38:02.60]Is that kind of?
[38:03.28]No, not really.
[38:05.18]Let's see what he's doing.
[38:06.80]He's like flipping his board around.
[38:08.47]I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[38:14.55]I'll figure it out.
[38:16.37]Trick book.
[38:17.51]Well, we're just getting into the very beginning of the game here.
[38:21.73]Hold the joystick up.
[38:23.87]Okay.
[38:25.45]All right.
[38:29.39]$10,000.
[38:29.43]Easy.
[38:32.59]I see a skull up there.
[38:33.81]I'm going to go up to the skull.
[38:43.79]Let's run.
[38:48.61]Why is walking so much better?
[38:51.19]Seems like it's more interesting to walk places.
[38:53.21]All right.
[38:54.51]Skull.
[38:57.46]Goddammit, I missed him.
[38:58.28]Alright, what is this?
[39:00.38]Campus Cruiser.
[39:03.64]Win the race.
[39:06.18]Okay.
[39:06.78]I'm racing now.
[39:07.88]Great.
[39:13.66]Don't touch me.
[39:14.34]Alright, you know the strategy here is to punch as many of them as I can.
[39:29.83]Fucking fell down.
[39:31.03]That guy sucks.
[39:32.73]That guy's fucking terrible.
[39:34.29]Fuck.
[39:41.53]Wait for me.
[39:41.97]I'm the old fat guy.
[39:42.91]I'm like the 46-year-old that's not supposed to be here.
[39:52.52]I didn't know.
[39:53.44]Hold on.
[39:54.38]Wait, wait, wait.
[39:57.16]Now I get it.
[39:58.06]I need to restart this whole thing.
[40:03.02]I'm not going fast enough.
[40:04.57]How am I supposed to go fast enough?
[40:06.81]Ride the wall.
[40:09.07]There we go.
[40:09.53]That's what I'm going to do from now on.
[40:17.00]Okay.
[40:18.06]I'll get it this time.
[40:19.76]At least that guy's a fucking idiot too.
[40:23.08]There's two fucking idiots.
[40:26.41]Ugh.
[40:27.81]Gate passed.
[40:29.99]They're so far away.
[40:31.49]Can I like lean forward?
[40:32.53]Yeah, I think so.
[40:37.03]Oh boy, there's traffic.
[40:40.96]Watch out for the cars.
[40:44.68]Alright, I'm doing fine.
[40:46.96]Gotta do a couple of tricks so people think I'm like a good player.
[40:54.06]Can I Raleigh?
[40:54.78]Can I Raleigh on this?
[40:56.16]No, not Raleigh.
[40:56.82]What's the fucking word I'm looking for?
[41:03.64]Oh god, I'm gonna get plowed by a car.
[41:07.22]It's only a matter of time before that happens.
[41:08.87]Alright, I'm good.
[41:16.17]We're gonna be fine.
[41:19.33]One, two, three, come on.
[41:22.33]But it's a Raleigh, I know, right?
[41:24.35]Watch, I'll show you what a Raleigh is.
[41:25.47]Oh, that was shitty.
[41:31.36]Don't even tell me I actually beat that guy.
[41:35.46]I beat... The fuck?
[41:37.32]That guy still hasn't crossed?
[41:39.32]Alright, we're gonna reach... Hold on a second.
[41:45.01]I was doing better than somebody else.
[41:48.87]Let's go.
[41:54.78]Stay right behind this guy.
[41:56.78]See, they don't get the idea.
[41:57.74]When you're skiing, you have to do the same shit, man.
[42:01.02]Ah, get fucked.
[42:02.56]God damn it.
[42:04.29]It's alright, I'm good.
[42:07.57]Ugh, what the fuck?
[42:11.59]Give me a break.
[42:12.97]No.
[42:14.29]How do I restart?
[42:15.73]Restart the challenge.
[42:18.22]I got too caught up in trying to push the other guy off.
[42:21.63]Just do it.
[42:22.71]Just escape.
[42:31.99]I'm gonna go up the wall.
[42:33.82]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[42:35.34]That guy blew it.
[42:36.86]That wasn't even my fault.
[42:37.88]That was that guy's fault.
[42:43.10]Hold on.
[42:45.54]Give me a fucking break.
[42:48.18]I bumped the back of that guy's car.
[42:53.74]Yeah, see, now I'm in first.
[42:54.74]Now I just can't fuck it up.
[42:55.84]Here we go.
[43:02.06]What the fuck is going on?
[43:04.33]Can I not make that shit?
[43:05.37]I think I just have to do that.
[43:07.69]Yeah.
[43:12.43]Here we are.
[43:14.78]Easy, easy.
[43:18.21]God damn it.
[43:19.01]Alright, well this is like a dead person in the road.
[43:27.68]Don't go downstairs.
[43:29.28]Well, I just have to beat it and like, I'm gonna get hit by a car here.
[43:31.10]I don't have to win.
[43:34.42]I just have to place.
[43:39.51]What happened there?
[43:40.75]Okay.
[43:42.01]Interesting.
[43:48.55]Don't fucking hit me, please.
[43:54.35]Alright, we're fine.
[43:56.57]I'm almost about to kill it.
[44:03.43]Oh my goodness.
[44:04.39]I'm hitting the lips and shit.
[44:06.99]I didn't kill it, but... I'm getting the hang of it.
[44:09.92]Alright.
[44:14.38]I'll beat it this time.
[44:15.18]Do I win anything?
[44:18.83]I win this time.
[44:21.19]Am I still in the tutorial?
[44:22.19]No.
[44:23.77]I didn't kill it.
[44:24.49]Yeah, we can't.
[44:25.15]We have to play.
[44:25.79]We have to be in first place.
[44:27.49]Here comes first place.
[44:31.05]Okay, this time I'm not going to try to jump the stairs.
[44:38.31]Like that.
[44:38.77]Okay.
[44:40.68]Like that.
[44:41.32]Alright, let's keep it up.
[44:43.92]I can do that one.
[44:45.44]Easy.
[44:45.76]Slow it down.
[44:46.44]Easy.
[44:49.15]Alright, just don't get hit by a bus.
[44:54.58]I can grab the backs of cars?
[44:55.74]Are you shitting me?
[44:56.32]Okay, easy.
[44:58.68]This is not gonna be good.
[44:59.38]Let's put the brakes on a little bit here.
[45:02.66]Like, if I... Right bumper, right?
[45:04.06]Oh, come on!
[45:06.52]I'm trying to grab the back of the car!
[45:08.28]It's alright, I'm still in the first place.
[45:09.48]Fucking no, I'm not.
[45:14.31]Wait, what?
[45:15.29]What is going on?
[45:16.93]Did I not go through it?
[45:22.12]I have to beat this guy.
[45:23.06]If I didn't try to grab the back of the fucking car.
[45:26.70]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[45:29.92]Get out of my way.
[45:32.26]Oh, it could happen to that guy too.
[45:33.76]It could happen to that guy too.
[45:37.92]He jumped over me.
[45:38.84]Alright, well I'm going to restart because I can't... Why would you grab it when you... I wanted to see what would happen.
[45:48.37]What a radical skater.
[45:50.64]I'm just trying to like learn the buttons.
[46:10.56]Hey, at least I fucked over that guy.
[46:13.22]Oh, come on.
[46:15.78]This game is fucking hard, man.
[46:17.48]Maybe I should have done, like, all these tutorial missions off stream.
[46:28.33]Get out of the way.
[46:31.95]Alright, first gate unlocked.
[46:35.01]Second gate, unlocking.
[46:37.49]Go.
[46:39.19]It's going real fast.
[46:40.37]It's alright.
[46:45.40]Just don't run into- Why would you be standing here?
[46:47.80]Get out of the way.
[46:48.32]You guys are a bunch of assholes.
[46:55.68]Alright, easy.
[46:56.88]Slow it down.
[46:57.55]Watch that curb.
[46:59.03]I would love to turn.
[46:59.77]Oh my fucking god.
[47:03.97]Oh my fucking god.
[47:05.03]I like couldn't turn the skateboard.
[47:09.25]I might still be able to make it up.
[47:13.59]Oh shit!
[47:19.26]Oh man.
[47:23.50]I did not expect this list to be like this hard for me.
[47:26.90]Get the fuck out of my way.
[47:30.06]I'm just gonna do that to like three people and I'll be fine.
[47:41.27]Alright, that guy fell.
[47:42.43]Alright.
[47:44.03]Fuck the brakes.
[47:44.61]We're just going.
[47:52.30]Oh, I can see the curb.
[47:53.16]I just couldn't turn my skateboard.
[47:54.72]I probably was... I think I was going too fast.
[48:04.99]Like, there.
[48:05.31]There we go.
[48:05.79]Alright.
[48:06.32]Let's go.
[48:10.15]Watch out for the fucking cars.
[48:15.68]No, please, don't have a random fucking pedestrian get in my goddamn way.
[48:20.04]You're shitting me.
[48:22.46]Fucking god.
[48:25.02]I like had it beat there too.
[48:26.35]A random guy was in my way.
[48:29.37]That was such horse shit.
[48:41.59]Well, I didn't come in last place.
[48:44.57]Or did I?
[48:49.04]Use the triggers?
[48:51.44]I can, like, cut corners with the triggers?
[49:00.33]Just right off the bat, that guy can go down.
[49:02.59]So I can get, like, at least to, like, first place.
[49:08.03]Alright.
[49:08.55]Down this way.
[49:11.73]Right up this guy's ass and it's gonna screw us both up.
[49:14.39]Yeah, fuck that guy.
[49:18.42]We all came in last place.
[49:19.76]Alright, we're gonna get it this time.
[49:27.02]What the fuck happened there?
[49:31.91]Was there just like a fight?
[49:37.83]Alright, now I can make it down this one.
[49:40.13]Not much effort.
[49:42.05]You fucking bitch.
[49:44.54]Get out of the way.
[49:45.48]These random idiot pedestrians.
[49:48.72]Alright, now he's gonna be careful.
[50:09.12]Get me the fuck outta here.
[50:10.73]I'm coming back later.
[50:13.13]Fuck this stupid mission.
[50:17.45]Fuck that.
[50:18.17]I need to learn how to play the game better before I do that shit.
[50:26.35]Get me the fuck outta there.
[50:29.78]Let's do the death box.
[50:37.57]Am I having fun on Skate 3?
[50:40.30]It's just hard to control.
[50:41.52]This game is fucking insanely difficult to control.
[50:47.92]It's fun, but I just gotta get better at it.
[50:50.64]Go over the death box.
[50:53.40]Nice.
[50:53.86]I got like 10 feet.
[50:59.83]What am I supposed to be doing?
[51:07.08]I think we just go back and forth?
[51:15.24]Uh... Okay.
[51:18.91]Air over the death box, I guess.
[51:25.67]I wanna just see what it is.
[51:28.11]Air over the death box.
[51:30.00]360 grab over the death box.
[51:33.40]Hand plant the pull.
[51:34.12]I don't even know how to do that!
[51:36.37]How do you do a hand plant?
[51:45.96]Can I even, like, get... I think I have to, like, go around like this, right?
[51:53.18]Alright, kind of.
[51:59.71]Did he not do the tutorial?
[52:01.33]I did, like, the very basic tutorial.
[52:07.19]I'm gonna assume you just have to, like, do this.
[52:09.71]And go around until you get, like, a bunch of speed.
[52:16.74]Or maybe not.
[52:20.64]I did it over the death box, come on!
[52:24.82]Oh, okay, that's a hand plant.
[52:26.50]I got it, okay.
[52:30.69]Ooh, alright, I did that.
[52:38.68]How did I get my gamer license?
[52:42.13]This is not, like, okay, but Tony, remember Tony Hawk?
[52:45.81]Tony Hawk, you just, like, press two buttons.
[52:48.99]Skate 3, it's like, I gotta hold down the right stick, and then move it, and flick it over that way, and then right stick, and then right bumper.
[52:57.21]It's a large, there's a large learning curve to this game, apparently.
[53:02.98]Okay.
[53:04.68]Let's go this way.
[53:18.15]I don't know how to, like... How do I get more speed to do this?
[53:20.77]Do I just keep going back and forth like this?
[53:26.37]I'm assuming... Alright, what if I just keep doing that?
[53:32.40]Okay.
[53:33.78]I think I have to just keep it going the whole way around?
[53:40.42]I have no fucking idea.
[53:41.60]Alright, let's walk it.
[53:48.96]Alright, I did it.
[53:49.56]Where's my points?
[53:59.00]Alright, hold on.
[53:59.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:00.46]Hold on a second.
[54:05.45]Oh, okay.
[54:06.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:07.05]I think I'm figuring... Yeah, I got it.
[54:08.95]Yep, alright.
[54:14.86]Oh, nope.
[54:16.02]It's the triggers.
[54:16.64]Let's do the grind on the stairs.
[54:27.29]Alright.
[54:28.91]I have no fucking idea how to play this game, so we're going to leave this challenge.
[54:33.66]Let's get out of this one and see what else there is to do.
[54:37.60]I can't get out of the stupid swimming pool.
[54:43.46]Get me out of here.
[54:45.23]I can't get out!
[54:48.52]Get out!
[54:49.84]Ah, you see that trick?
[54:52.20]Oh, by the way, this is for your game being like too fucking hard!
[54:56.86]What are you looking at?
[54:59.30]At least I can do that trick.
[55:08.05]You can't even get out of the pool.
[55:11.25]It's the different button... Here, here's what's really fucking me up.
[55:14.60]All the button combinations you have to know for the game are fucking in my brain smashing into each other like on the highway.
[55:24.28]I'm so used to playing Tony Hawk where you hold A to jump.
[55:27.44]That like doing like the right stick down right stick is... I can't do it.
[55:30.68]I can't do it.
[55:31.90]It ain't gonna happen.
[55:33.96]The right stick controls it.
[55:35.26]Can I turn that off?
[55:38.32]Otherwise we're gonna be here for a long fucking time.
[55:43.61]Easy.
[55:46.35]Fucking easy mode.
[55:49.25]What?
[55:49.51]Hall of Meat?
[55:50.01]What is Hall of Meat?
[55:53.73]Where is it?
[55:59.27]Hall of Meat?
[56:00.83]What does that mean?
[56:10.15]You can press X to jump.
[56:11.25]X just kind of does that.
[56:14.55]Oh, I got the car.
[56:17.55]Nice!
[56:20.71]Now what do I do?
[56:21.27]Alright, you almost slap it into a tree.
[56:27.49]That's what you do.
[56:30.13]Uh, let's take some more pictures.
[56:32.33]Uh, let's get off the skateboard and go this way.
[56:41.29]What just happened?
[56:43.59]Wait, where's the map?
[56:44.48]Can I see the map somehow?
[56:48.29]Upload video.
[56:48.83]No, I don't want to upload a fucking video.
[56:52.55]Everything seems to be back here.
[56:55.01]Let's go this way.
[56:58.27]Or maybe not.
[56:59.19]I'm just going to ride this around and see where it takes me.
[57:06.23]I turned on Halloween.
[57:07.09]I'm not sure what it does.
[57:10.15]Fast travel to the big skate park.
[57:11.79]How do I open that menu up?
[57:16.65]Challenge map.
[57:17.13]Okay, there we go.
[57:18.91]A haul of meat.
[57:22.72]Okay.
[57:27.68]Meat in training.
[57:32.21]Learn the basics of bailing from the top of the library.
[57:34.57]Falling on your face never felt better.
[57:38.03]Trigger a bail in the air, bail in a cannonball pose, and bail in a judo kick pose.
[57:43.78]What?
[57:49.71]What the fuck?
[57:51.63]I have to, like, purposely hurt myself?
[58:01.24]Alright, left trigger and right trigger to bail.
[58:07.00]Left stick and right stick?
[58:08.94]Oh, everything.
[58:13.26]Okay.
[58:14.40]Hey, we found the thing I'm gonna have fun with.
[58:17.80]Alright, cannonball pose?
[58:27.93]Judo kick?
[58:29.63]What the hell is a judo kick pose?
[58:34.15]That's not... That wasn't a judo kick pose.
[58:38.08]Or maybe it was.
[58:40.40]Torpedo?
[58:43.98]Hold bro... Well, bailing to do a torpedo.
[58:46.24]Okay.
[58:53.42]Alright, nice.
[58:54.08]Spread eagle?
[58:56.98]How do I do a spread eagle?
[58:59.62]Oh, Jesus!
[59:02.72]This just got inherently more interesting.
[59:06.22]Adjust your body with left stickin'.
[59:09.12]Okay, left stickin'.
[59:10.04]Okay, I landed on my leg.
[59:12.40]Legs and shins.
[59:15.38]Alright, nice.
[59:16.22]This is gonna be fun.
[59:25.71]Where are the other meat grinder modes?
[59:32.75]Broke my groin.
[59:33.65]Alright, let's take a look at the challenge map.
[59:39.76]Alright, hall of meat.
[59:41.32]Balcony building.
[59:43.60]Let's try this one.
[59:47.52]I'm sorry I didn't know how to play this game really before I started streaming it.
[59:52.81]When I stream this game again, I'll make sure I know how to fucking play.
[59:55.49]Alright, cannonball down the stairs.
[60:02.78]Score 50,000 Hall of Meat points.
[60:05.00]Okay.
[60:10.60]Oh, Jesus.
[60:16.30]Push off down the stairs.
[60:17.26]Cannonball down the stairs.
[60:18.02]You got it.
[60:18.62]Easy mode.
[60:27.88]That wasn't a cannonball, okay.
[60:30.12]Right trigger to push off the ground.
[60:32.92]What?
[60:36.70]Alright.
[60:50.53]Let's try this again.
[60:56.33]Alright, you gotta stop doing that, man.
[61:00.69]Good, I'm bad at the hurting myself part.
[61:03.64]I'm bad at the making the guy skate forward part.
[61:18.18]What the fuck am I doing?
[61:23.54]What is going on?
[61:24.58]Why am I doing this?
[61:40.84]That should not have worked.
[61:41.84]Give me those bonus points.
[61:50.75]Alright, I killed it.
[61:59.21]I killed it.
[61:59.73]I got $50,000.
[62:03.53]Dude, Reddit wasn't kidding.
[62:04.95]Like, he hooked us up right.
[62:06.29]Did he say Reddit?
[62:09.33]We got everything we needed.
[62:10.77]Dude, Reddit wasn't kidding.
[62:11.71]Did you see that thread?
[62:15.72]Alright, what else we got?
[62:17.18]On the list of maps.
[62:19.84]Photo, pros, team promos, street contests.
[62:23.46]Holy shit, there's a lot of these.
[62:28.92]Uh...
[62:34.51]How about... Which one of these do I want to try?
[62:39.27]Bone cubes?
[62:41.67]Break a leg bone, break your spine, break your collarbone.
[62:44.41]Okay.
[62:55.10]After this, I want to actually learn how to skate.
[62:59.12]We're going to learn together.
[63:01.84]Even if it kills me.
[63:07.81]Alright, uh, can I just walk off?
[63:12.56]Can I just, like, walk off?
[63:16.12]Okay, yeah, I guess so.
[63:20.80]Alright.
[63:21.30]Alright, how come there's no, like, sounds?
[63:26.29]I'm not hearing any noises.
[63:32.93]Break your spine.
[63:33.69]Alright, what about if I just go like this?
[63:38.38]I'll break my fucking spine.
[63:40.68]No, that's not my spine, that's my forehead.
[63:49.43]Okay, I break four bones.
[63:53.73]I didn't break my hand there, how did I not break my hand?
[63:59.60]Here we go, spine.
[64:00.86]Spine!
[64:02.66]Oh, here we go, spine.
[64:05.99]Making my own noises.
[64:07.75]Break eight bones in one bill, holy jeez.
[64:09.95]Okay, we're not gonna move that much.
[64:15.03]There we go, there's the hip.
[64:16.87]Break my skull?
[64:17.71]You tell me one of those times I didn't break my skull?
[64:27.87]Oops, what the hell is going on?
[64:29.39]Why is this frozen?
[64:33.87]Why is it in slow motion?
[64:36.77]Was I doing that?
[64:37.43]Alright, right here.
[64:39.63]Break my skull.
[64:41.68]Come on, there we go.
[64:43.68]Alright, break my collarbone.
[64:46.52]Collarbone should be easy enough, just lay flat.
[64:49.20]Like this.
[64:50.76]Shit.
[64:56.51]Come on, flatten it out.
[64:58.95]God damn it, stop hitting your face.
[65:01.47]What?
[65:02.11]That was a collarbone, right there.
[65:09.31]There we go.
[65:09.61]No, what?
[65:11.11]Not collarbone, apparently.
[65:17.53]Ah!
[65:18.87]This is weird without the sound effects.
[65:20.23]Maybe it's like a backwards compatibility thing.
[65:27.41]Let's get some fucking speed here.
[65:40.26]Alright, I need a couple more points.
[65:42.22]And then I gotta break the collarbone.
[65:45.05]I gotta smash my fucking collarbone here.
[65:52.47]Oh, come on!
[65:52.99]That was so close.
[65:57.21]My guy's still freaking out.
[66:01.49]Sound effects are top notch.
[66:02.56]Yeah, I'm not sure what the hell that's about.
[66:09.31]Yeah, it feels weird not being able to hear anything.
[66:14.17]Yeah, this just came to backwards compatibility like a week ago or so.
[66:21.60]There it is.
[66:22.10]What?
[66:25.08]Come on.
[66:25.52]You're going to tell me I can't break my collarbone like that?
[66:30.06]I'm breaking every bone but my collarbone somehow.
[66:42.13]There it is.
[66:42.61]Okay.
[66:51.45]I messed with the settings.
[66:52.11]Yeah, but the only thing I did is this.
[66:56.26]See, the sound effects are up to 100%.
[66:57.26]The music is the only thing that's down because of copyright.
[67:01.22]Does my guy even have a call button?
[67:02.46]I'm starting to think that he doesn't.
[67:04.38]I'm just going to drop down.
[67:06.88]Just like see if I can hit my phone.
[67:08.32]Right here.
[67:11.21]Nope.
[67:13.76]I feel like you gotta land flat for the collarbone.
[67:19.10]Okay.
[67:20.88]I just broke every single fucking bone in my body.

[89:30.61]No, it didn't work.
[89:43.38]The game is on easy.

[90:34.39]Yeah, I fucked up that one big time.
[90:37.69]Great job.
[90:41.85]You gotta give me at least a break.
[90:45.35]This is the first time I've ever played this game.
[90:48.93]I haven't played Skate 1, never played Skate 2.
[90:54.26]I've only played Skate 3.
[90:57.26]And I started playing it for the first time an hour ago.
[90:59.84]I don't play fucking skating games.
[91:01.70]I love this game.
[91:02.32]It's fucking fun as hell.
[91:06.57]I'm trying to learn how to play it.
[91:09.45]Give me a fucking little bit of a slack.
[91:12.13]Pull the hose out a little.
[91:24.06]Oh shit, it's doing like the robot chicken.
[91:25.60]That means I'm not doing good enough.
[91:26.66]Alright, get me out of the bowl.
[91:41.02]I'm not sure what else to do.
[91:42.68]Besides, like, these, like, little kickflips.
[91:44.50]Ooh, come on.
[91:45.34]Time's three.
[91:46.04]Let's do it.
[91:47.54]Ooh, all right.
[91:48.00]Don't lose it here.
[91:48.56]It's okay.
[91:54.14]I lost it, but I got a lot of points.
[92:17.10]Get me out of the ball.
[92:19.32]What happened?
[92:21.48]I guess I fucking fell back.
[92:24.54]Alright, well, it doesn't matter.
[92:25.54]I won.
[92:26.83]That's fine.
[92:27.29]Yeah, let's do it again.
[92:36.69]Round two.
[92:51.47]Alright, let's do it.
[92:53.75]Yeah, I just gotta stay.
[92:57.62]I just gotta stay in fucking first place.
[93:01.60]Nothing wild.
[93:03.08]Nothing insane.
[93:04.16]Just bring things together.
[93:05.92]Oh, he's stuck.
[93:06.80]Oh.

[93:35.54]That guy really just fucked me up.
[93:37.52]Oh, shit.
[93:55.04]Uh, let's see here.
[93:55.90]I can't... No.
[93:57.02]I don't know why I keep trying to do that one.
[94:00.44]I guess I can, like, string that together like that.
[94:05.31]If I can.
[94:05.67]No, I'm gonna lose.
[94:06.23]Well, actually, maybe not.
[94:06.81]If I can get, like, one more thing down here.
[94:08.07]Oh!
[94:27.56]Alright, well... That was fucking terrible.
[94:32.54]Came in third place.
[94:33.74]I'm getting away from this, I wanna do something else.
[94:45.49]Kill the other players?
[94:46.43]Holy shit, I just like kicked the fucking thing.
[95:00.01]I need to learn more than a kickflip and ollie.
[95:05.52]Yeah, it's like, it's moving the, uh... Isn't it moving, like, the fucking, like, up-down on the, uh... Like, you can do down-up and shit like that.
[95:13.88]How do you do, like, different tricks?
[95:16.54]Besides, like, a shove-it, a kickflip, uh... Back kickflip, like, pop shove-it, fs shove-it.
[95:23.15]Because, like, I don't know how to do grabs with the triggers.
[95:35.20]Go to the tutorials?
[95:36.84]I thought I already did the tutorials.
[95:38.00]I guess there's like more?
[95:39.24]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[95:41.84]Well... Uh, when I did the tutorial... I didn't know that there was more tutorial.
[95:51.67]We're gonna go sign up for advanced grinds.
[95:59.23]I did like the initial tutorial and I thought it was like, alright, now go play.
[96:02.93]No, no, no, go sign up for the other tutorials.
[96:07.04]What a bunch of dog shit.
[96:10.47]Okay, go grind a rail.
[96:11.61]I jumped over the rail.
[96:12.51]Okay.
[96:12.65]Right, I was doing that before.
[96:13.79]Grind a rail.
[96:35.23]This time, do a board slide.
[96:37.22]Okay.
[96:38.70]Okay, now go skate another rail.
[96:42.48]Okay, now turn your board to the other side.
[96:46.78]Get on your board, buddy.
[96:47.80]This ain't walking.
[96:48.66]I fell off.
[96:49.58]I thought it was going to tell me more things.
[96:59.59]Wasn't I doing that before?
[97:00.79]I feel like I was already doing that.
[97:05.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[97:06.54]That is Jason Lee, I believe.
[97:10.86]Alright, well, let's go learn the other tutorials.
[97:20.36]Air tricks.
[97:21.38]Sign up.
[97:24.23]Alright.
[97:25.87]Skate down the ramp.
[97:28.39]Okie dokie.
[97:38.81]you're stuck in the air man I told you coach Frank was the best now grab that board yeah I was already doing this that's triggering okay okay you better let go of the board before you land otherwise you might break your finger all right so you just pull the direction
[98:04.08]Yep.
[98:04.22]Same exact thing.
[98:04.78]Alright.
[98:05.12]Cool.
[98:05.36]He's the Archmage.
[98:06.94]Anything else?
[98:07.54]Point your nose forward and then grab your board.
[98:10.59]Point and then grab.
[98:12.89]Okay.
[98:36.22]Okay, tweak first.
[98:39.25]I get it, I get it, okay.
[98:44.85]Unless you want to swallow your knees and possibly squash your grapefruit, you better let go of your board before you land.
[98:53.92]Now for a variety of tweaked airs, just follow the instructions in your HUD.
[99:01.60]That's what they call a judo game, man.
[99:04.16]Judo.
[99:05.60]Whoa!
[99:06.17]Keep it classy like Coach Frank.
[99:08.07]So it's... Okay.
[99:09.31]So what I was doing, I was holding the buttons down.
[99:11.97]But I wasn't... Okay, I get it, I get it.
[99:13.29]Alright, hit that blaster.
[99:14.93]That should immensely improve what I'm trying to do here.
[99:20.92]Probably didn't know you can also flip the board in the air.
[99:23.82]Do it.
[99:25.94]You can flip the board with your fingers like a finger flip.
[99:29.86]Oh, left trigger.
[99:38.63]Alright.
[99:41.94]Let's do the next one.
[99:47.84]Christ air.
[99:48.48]Forever my favorite trick.
[99:52.18]Alright.
[99:52.90]Challenge map.
[99:53.80]Let's do the other ones.
[99:56.57]Pumping transition.
[99:58.57]Let's go.
[99:58.89]I would have done these off stream.
[100:02.59]I just didn't know they existed.
[100:05.51]So I apologize for that.
[100:13.43]Crouch in the blue area and then stand up in the yellow area.
[100:17.81]Okay, crouch.
[100:20.51]Crouch?
[100:20.95]We're doing the kind of reverse, huh?
[100:22.67]Crouch, kid!
[100:25.03]Now stand up!
[100:26.92]See, it's easy, man.
[100:28.18]Alright, do another one.
[100:29.18]Jesus fucking Christ, are you serious?
[100:30.98]Crouch, man!
[100:31.80]Alright, now stand up!
[100:33.84]Oh my god.
[100:36.88]This would have made things so much easier if I knew how to do that.
[100:40.00]Oh my god, dude, what the fuck?
[100:41.32]If I knew that you could do this.
[100:42.58]That's so unfortunate.
[100:44.84]That, like, I've been streaming for, like, a fucking hour and a half.
[100:47.87]And I didn't know that you could even do this.
[101:04.92]He sounds so angry.
[101:07.10]I am.
[101:07.54]I'm disappointed in myself that I, like, didn't know I could, like, even do this shit.
[101:15.20]Alright.
[101:15.70]Pump each parameter object.
[101:16.98]Let's go.
[101:17.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[101:21.10]Yep, yep, yep.
[101:33.82]Any tranny you see, you can pump it.
[101:37.92]You can pump it.
[101:38.92]Build up speed by doing a few pumps in a row.
[101:41.38]Did I miss one?
[101:52.03]I hopped over it.
[101:55.40]Alright, let's just quit out of this.
[101:58.26]Actually, no.
[101:59.14]Is there anything after it?
[102:02.58]I'm getting, like, too much speed on one of these.
[102:04.64]Let's do this one more time so I can get it down.
[102:09.38]Alright, this one.
[102:17.40]There we go.
[102:20.16]See, what I was doing is when I looked at the chat and people were like, you gotta hold right trigger.
[102:23.34]I was like, oh, I thought you meant, like, when you go off a jump, you right trigger, like, on the way down.
[102:29.24]Okay, I'm gonna compare to Tony Hawk again.
[102:31.81]And Tony Hawk, remember when you crouched down while you were coming down off of a jump to get more speed?
[102:40.11]I'm playing this game like Tony Hawk and that's not right.
[102:47.87]Only two more.
[102:57.72]Tony Hawk was also an arcade game.
[103:00.57]Yeah, all the things I was saying were incorrect about this game.
[103:05.61]I just didn't understand.
[103:06.49]This little manual meter I put together will measure you when you're in the zone.
[103:10.69]I just thought I was doing something completely fucking wrong, and I was.
[103:15.60]Manual, move the right stick too far.
[103:17.96]Just let it go and try again, okay, buddy?
[103:22.12]Manual, that's how you do a manual?
[103:23.70]Now I want you to get into a manual and do a flip trick out.
[103:27.48]That'll teach you.
[103:28.48]Okay.
[103:29.70]Let's get some speed.
[103:34.54]So how do I do a flip trick?
[103:35.48]Out.
[103:48.73]Am I missing something here?
[104:00.53]Thanks, Coach Frank.
[104:07.97]Okey-dokey.
[104:11.79]I thought it wanted me to jump out of that.
[104:19.37]Can I land in an ollie?
[104:20.53]I mean, a manual as well?
[104:24.09]Kind of.
[104:24.37]Alright, let's go.
[104:30.17]There's even more shit to learn.
[104:33.29]Dark slides.
[104:36.39]Hold right bumper to catch the board while doing a flip trick.
[104:38.97]Oh boy.
[104:44.99]Why is the guy from the Chipmunks movie teaching him how to escape?
[104:47.29]Right bumper.
[104:47.63]And then kickflip.
[104:58.22]Dark slide.
[104:59.50]Holy shit, the board was upside down.
[105:06.19]Damn.
[105:23.36]Change the audio settings to 5.1 surround sound to fix the audio settings.
[105:27.07]Okay, well, where do I go for that?
[105:31.25]Does it even exist?
[105:33.83]All I see is sound effects, music, and dialogue.
[105:41.98]Is it somewhere else that I don't know?
[105:48.08]Let's get a little bit of speed.
[105:57.33]I fucked it up.
[105:57.93]No, I had it the right way the first time.
[106:07.45]Mmm, spin around.
[106:12.53]I was just checking every menu.
[106:28.12]Who needs settings?
[106:28.82]Yeah, who needs settings?
[106:32.74]Alright, let's, uh... What are the last two?
[106:36.15]Underflips.
[106:44.41]Nominee for worst stream so far.
[106:46.47]I've learned how to play the fucking game.
[106:51.66]I'm trying to learn how to play this game.
[106:55.25]Go on.
[106:57.51]Give me a break.
[107:00.91]I wonder how good you were in Skate 3 in your first hour playing the game.
[107:05.72]I bet you weren't very good.
[107:06.78]Flip it faster.
[107:08.22]Okay.
[107:08.32]Am I not doing it fast enough?
[107:23.62]Huh.
[107:28.14]Set up your trick.
[107:35.19]Do a kick or heel flip and quickly flick it back to underflip.
[107:41.21]Okay.
[107:41.41]Almost had it that time.
[107:53.32]Oh, I'm doing it.
[107:55.26]I'm doing it, Frank.
[107:57.14]Here we go.
[108:00.22]I'm doing it as fast as I can, Frank.
[108:05.40]Yeah, I got an achievement.
[108:10.92]Alright.
[108:11.86]Let's go do some stuff.
[108:13.96]Now that I know how to play.
[108:15.61]Very... rarely.
[108:19.73]No, no, I don't want to upload to fucking EA Nation.
[108:24.88]Oh my god.
[108:27.13]Hold on a second, fucking... Fuck you EA nation.
[108:31.01]I don't know why this exists anymore.
[108:41.17]That probably, does that even work?
[108:44.86]Does EA nation even work?
[108:55.05]All right, let's do.
[109:01.60]Uh.
[109:05.66]Film challenges focus on getting footage of lines.
[109:08.12]Yeah.
[109:12.78]I don't know.
[109:13.16]Let's see what this is on the lot, whatever it is.
[109:15.29]EA in 2016.
[109:23.36]Did I fix the settings?
[109:24.20]I don't think so.
[109:28.50]Nah, let's do it.
[109:30.40]Whatever it is, let's do it.
[109:37.49]Grind session.
[109:38.25]Simple grind.
[109:38.81]Rainbow grind.
[109:39.63]Let's see what this is.
[109:42.79]Reach the target score.
[109:43.82]Okay.
[109:48.80]Let's do a dark slide.
[110:01.93]Uh, 2,000 points?
[110:07.34]No.
[110:08.56]Am I timed?
[110:09.00]Yeah, I'm timed.
[110:10.46]Ah, shit, I didn't put a session marker.
[110:11.78]I gotta remember to do that.
[110:13.78]Does that fuck you up?
[110:17.38]If you put a session marker and you start over?
[110:21.61]Let's see what happens.
[110:34.04]flopped off.
[110:37.04]Alright, no.
[110:37.60]That works.
[110:45.28]Ooh, you did a little nosy.
[110:49.68]No, I don't think so.
[110:59.30]Alright, let's do it a couple more times.
[111:05.37]I'm gonna say it like two more times probably.
[111:11.51]Session making is a big part of the game.
[111:12.59]Alright, let's go.
[111:24.67]Switch it up!
[111:35.03]Dark slide!
[111:39.23]Ooh!
[111:39.87]Alright, I did it.
[111:47.46]No, that worked.
[111:49.16]Now what?
[111:49.50]More activities?
[111:52.54]Okay.
[111:53.90]Let's do the other activity.
[111:58.84]Now what?
[111:59.52]Do I have to... No, shit.
[112:04.85]I guess I just kind of skipped out of it.
[112:08.27]Simple grind.
[112:09.37]Grind to clear the stairs.
[112:11.07]Okay, don't touch the stairs.
[112:16.55]Alright, change it back to normal.
[112:18.36]Okay, we'll do that.
[112:20.82]Now that I have a very basic understanding of what I'm doing, that's probably not a terrible idea.
[112:29.10]Pro Dark Souls player can't do a dark slide.
[112:37.45]That was easy.
[112:40.26]Next challenge.
[112:46.30]Hit X this time, not A. More activities.
[112:48.92]Give me something cool.
[112:50.32]Rainbow grind.
[112:51.16]Tag.
[112:52.68]Grind six of the twelve rainbow rail benches around the Chan Center Plaza.
[113:02.53]Okay.
[113:02.65]Okay.
[113:07.54]Didn't really have enough speed, but I'll take it.
[113:11.87]Yeah.
[113:13.67]I'll go this way.
[113:14.63]Let's make our way over here.
[113:21.09]Mm-hmm.
[113:22.69]Mm-hmm.
[113:25.39]Mm-hmm.
[113:30.10]Ooh.
[113:31.10]Ooh, that one didn't count.
[113:33.28]That one didn't count.
[113:41.28]I didn't really do anything fancy there, but whatever.
[113:42.95]One more.
[113:47.75]This one.
[113:50.85]I miss Coach Frank.
[113:53.07]What happened to Coach Frank, anyways?
[113:59.38]On to the next activity!
[114:11.96]Curves and grinds.
[114:12.98]All right.
[114:14.05]Grind the planters.
[114:18.69]Three, two, one.
[114:21.13]Action.
[114:28.04]Fuck.
[114:31.90]Right here.
[114:35.74]On the board.
[114:36.40]Grind it.
[114:45.41]Yeah, this is a big, this is a cool grind gesture, and I agree.
[114:53.26]Oh, I fucked it up.
[114:56.22]Uh, I'm just gonna skater on.
[115:02.59]Oh, fuck.
[115:04.49]Get me back to the goddamn marker.
[115:07.51]Spawn 50 fucking franks.
[115:10.39]Yeah, let's spawn 50 coach franks.
[115:20.11]Trying to play this game like another game I talked about.
[115:23.39]And it's not working.
[115:33.42]Go, go, go, go, go.
[115:37.72]Nope.
[115:39.04]Nope.
[115:41.34]All right, just get me on the board and just do it right here.
[115:44.18]I did it.
[115:44.46]Oh, no, I didn't.
[115:45.20]Fuck.
[115:59.08]This makes me want to play Tony Hawk.
[116:01.82]Me too.
[116:03.72]I kind of want to play Tony Hawk too.
[116:10.74]How's the rain?
[116:11.48]It is raining outside.
[116:12.22]You're right.
[116:15.58]Trick list trial.
[116:16.52]Let's do this one.
[116:18.76]Do any flip trick down the ramp.
[116:20.56]Grind the rail.
[116:21.18]Do a grab trick down the ramp.
[116:24.33]200 point trick down the ramp.
[116:25.93]Okay.
[116:30.31]I'll put my marker here.
[116:34.15]See, the problem is all the recent Tony Hawk games have been fucking terrible.
[116:39.84]See, it was like not fucking random pedestrians.
[116:43.26]Can you get out of the fucking- Stop bumping into each other!
[116:45.72]Get the fuck out of the way!
[116:51.85]Get- Go shopping somewhere else!
[117:05.05]See, those fucking idiots, like, screwed it all up for me.
[117:09.19]I have to, like, turn all the way around.
[117:13.51]What the hell?
[117:16.23]Some guy just fucking fu- What?
[117:19.46]Who the hell is that?
[117:20.22]I just got pushed by a lumberjack.
[117:25.64]Come on, man.
[117:29.47]No, this game's not.
[117:30.45]This isn't a bad game.
[117:31.95]I was just making a reference to the fact that all the recent Tony Hawk games have been fucking awful.
[117:38.34]This game just is a thousand times more difficult than Tony Hawk.
[117:48.39]Let's go back to the marker.
[117:52.32]Go down the ramp.
[117:53.44]Flip trick down the ramp.
[117:54.52]Alright.
[117:55.32]Okay.
[117:55.76]I don't think I have enough speed here.
[117:59.52]No, I don't.
[118:02.86]Let's do a pumpy.
[118:07.60]Alright, let's go.
[118:13.22]I need more speed.
[118:14.40]Okay.
[118:27.32]Can I make it down there?
[118:29.86]Grab chick trick down the ramp.
[118:31.36]Do I have to?
[118:32.16]Let's just stay safe here.
[118:33.00]No.
[118:33.06]Okay, I don't have to clear the ramp.
[118:42.22]I'm putting myself in a really stupid, awkward position.
[118:47.19]Oh, fuck.
[118:47.51]This is timed.
[118:48.19]Shit.
[118:48.99]I wasn't even paying attention to that.
[118:56.76]Oh, boy.
[118:57.10]Let's see if I can do this in the time I have.
[119:02.83]Now I'm just, like, rushing.
[119:03.97]No, I'm going to restart it.
[119:13.73]Restart!
[119:15.15]Ow!
[119:19.51]Ow, that hurts so bad.
[119:24.51]Oh my god, get these fucking people out of the goddamn way.
[119:28.61]Do they have- He's gonna hit me again.
[119:31.05]Seriously, get out of the fucking way.
[119:33.78]Get out of the fucking way.
[119:39.70]They have to congregate everybody there.
[119:45.38]We all don't need to be sitting in the same place.
[119:50.27]That's not- That guy's gonna get mad at me now.
[119:51.93]Watch this.
[119:56.72]The arrow means he's gonna, like, punch me, right?
[120:02.96]That was a... What?
[120:04.52]That kick flipped down there.
[120:10.82]Isn't that a kick... What?
[120:14.47]Oh, okay.
[120:23.11]This one guy just wants to keep getting hit by my skateboard.
[120:26.57]He's just a magnet to my character.
[120:30.71]Now I'm like on tilt because of this fucking guy that's standing in the wrong spot.
[120:38.88]We're on the outside ledge.
[120:43.28]Or the inside ledge.
[120:49.21]Okay, 400 points.
[120:50.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[120:53.39]No, go back.
[120:59.09]And... Why did you do that?
[121:00.71]Why would you push that guy?
[121:04.19]These people are just now fighting here.
[121:05.47]No, hold on.
[121:09.25]I'm gonna do a... Doesn't matter what it is.
[121:11.63]Oh, shit.
[121:18.52]Guy's in the wrong spot.
[121:19.60]He kind of was now.
[121:22.94]I'm rushing this now.
[121:23.90]Just need to get it.
[121:30.70]What?
[121:31.04]Why did I not land that?
[121:31.76]I should have landed that.
[121:34.16]Oh, here comes the fucking brigade of pedestrians.
[121:40.26]They always have to be in this one.
[121:41.62]Right down the fucking... Right down Main Street.
[121:48.11]Okay.
[121:52.38]That's not it.
[121:52.98]Yeah, that's it.
[121:55.20]What's the last activity?
[121:58.00]This one.
[122:00.24]Gap or grind the stairway.
[122:03.12]Okay.
[122:10.11]Forgetting the manuals.
[122:11.19]I mean, I know they exist, but...
[122:14.61]Can I land into a manual?
[122:16.93]Like, a la Tony Hawk?
[122:22.65]I'm not sure I can.
[122:23.25]Uh, hold on.
[122:30.85]Get off the skateboard.
[122:31.81]Just get up here.
[122:32.29]I just need to jump over this.
[122:35.89]Tight, tight, tight.
[122:37.87]What?
[122:41.55]I'm just gonna go grind it.
[122:47.60]Fuck it out.
[122:50.24]Yes, you can.
[122:50.91]Okay.
[122:55.29]Oh, that's that.
[122:58.61]Don't touch him!
[122:59.97]Don't touch the stairs!
[123:06.74]So what do I get for doing that?
[123:07.56]$20,000?
[123:08.92]Okey-dokey.
[123:09.30]Thank you to Disco239.
[123:18.69]for your subscription.
[123:19.81]Crylo Ren for six months.
[123:22.79]Oh, my chest.
[123:24.03]No soup for you for nine months.
[123:25.13]No soup for you.
[123:25.63]Thanks, dude.
[123:26.99]Early stream.
[123:27.55]Some people have to go to the hellhole known as school, you know.
[123:31.35]Oh.
[123:32.07]I'm sorry, but in the next, like, hour, I gotta get out of here.
[123:34.50]I have a family... important family get-together to go to.
[123:38.92]Reese K. Thanks for the sub.
[123:40.44]For the Emperor.
[123:43.50]Snapplefax.
[123:44.68]Dr. Cheese for nine months.
[123:45.68]Thanks a lot, guys.
[123:47.10]Gorjor and Belm.
[123:48.14]Ophos for six months.
[123:49.32]Krusty Daddy.
[123:51.48]Thanks, Ophos, for the six months.
[123:54.40]Welcome back, guys.
[123:56.24]Todd, also 500.
[123:57.30]You in a desert island, you could either listen to Plastic Beach forever or Demon Days forever.
[124:04.89]Probably Plastic Beach.
[124:06.65]Only because I wouldn't want Demon Days to play so much that I didn't like it.
[124:12.51]So there you go.
[124:13.39]But thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[124:16.23]Much appreciated, Todd.
[124:17.87]And everybody else.
[124:21.33]Alright.
[124:22.83]Back to what we were doing.
[124:26.96]It was just Thanksgiving.
[124:27.80]This is a different... This is an important family affair.
[124:34.72]On the lawn.
[124:35.26]Alright, let's actually do... What was that thing called again?
[124:37.41]Street Contests.
[124:40.70]Let's try this one again, now that I have learned a little bit more about the game.
[124:51.14]Let's actually get some points here.
[124:58.64]No, I didn't want to do that.
[125:07.63]Shit.
[125:07.95]No, I'll just restart it.
[125:09.21]I fucked it up already.
[125:13.75]Do you remember it's your dad keeps streaming?
[125:15.97]I plan on it, man.
[125:19.01]Alright, stay out of the bowl.
[125:20.19]Don't go in the bowl.
[125:27.62]Nope, start over again.
[125:31.44]Do manuals between tricks.
[125:33.20]That's going to be so hard for me to do.
[125:35.50]It really is.
[125:38.10]All the right stick shit that's in this game is going to make that impossible for me.
[125:47.37]So he's saying, like, get off this and then... I want to see if I can do that.
[125:54.44]Too much right stick.
[125:55.44]No rewinds.
[125:55.74]Go, go, go, go, go.
[126:01.40]So that's manual, but... Okay, I guess it is still going.
[126:19.43]I'm trying to see here.
[126:22.21]So if I do a manual, how much more points do I get?
[126:27.67]So like right here, like manual.
[126:32.03]Okay, manual again.
[126:35.19]Trying to figure out the proper way to do this.
[126:39.97]I'll restart it again.
[126:49.05]Right before you land, slightly hold the right stick down.
[126:51.29]Oh my god.
[126:53.91]That is going to be impossible for me to do.
[127:00.47]Back at Tony Hawk, it was up-down really fast.
[127:04.33]And it would just go.
[127:09.61]I'm going to try to get it.
[127:11.45]No, that's not how you do it?
[127:21.67]I get a secret tape.
[127:31.06]When I hold down a little bit, it just fucks me up.
[127:32.96]I need to be going way faster.
[127:35.28]This used to be a mayonnaise stream.
[127:42.60]Just jump around a bunch.
[127:45.79]I'm not even going to worry about manuals right now.
[127:48.92]This is your chance to shine.
[127:51.48]I'm just going to keep going.
[127:55.80]This is my last restart.
[128:00.49]Then I'm going to move on.
[128:06.15]Don't do long grinds.
[128:07.09]Grind for a millisecond, then flip it.
[128:10.83]Whatever happens, I'm just going to keep going.
[128:12.69]Wait, this is skateboarding.
[128:19.11]Go, go, go.
[128:20.09]This way.
[128:20.59]Okay.
[128:25.43]Nope.
[128:25.91]Oh, boy.
[128:28.07]That is so tricky.
[128:29.78]But fuck it.
[128:30.24]Let's just go.
[128:38.04]Can I go up this way?
[128:38.88]No, I don't want to do that.
[128:41.70]I'll fall off if I keep that up.
[128:47.56]Nope.
[128:52.90]This game doesn't look like any fun.
[128:55.28]It's fun.
[128:56.66]It's just excruciatingly difficult.
[129:01.93]It's very hard to play this game.
[129:06.01]Which I guess that's some of the appeal, right?
[129:13.53]Nope, that's not gonna work.
[129:14.51]This guy's a dick.
[129:26.42]It's one of the most satisfying games when you get it right.
[129:28.22]Oh yeah, I can imagine.
[129:29.36]Hell yeah.
[129:33.89]But I feel like it's going to take a long time to get it right.
[129:44.20]This is the best skating game I've ever played.
[129:47.44]Yeah, I guess I just wasn't anticipating the huge learning curve.
[129:53.34]This is the first time I've ever played this game.
[129:55.04]So that was probably not the smartest thing in the world.
[130:02.98]Big points coming in.
[130:07.95]Oh boy.
[130:09.27]Nah, I'm just going to move on.
[130:11.63]I obviously still don't have the hang of it.
[130:13.65]It's going to take a long time for me to get it.
[130:15.31]So when people say Mongo, what do they mean?
[130:17.17]What's going on with that basketball hoop?
[130:21.53]This doesn't seem right.
[130:27.61]What the fuck is going on here?
[130:31.36]Can I, like, grab this thing?
[130:32.38]Alright, well, it's just gonna sit in the concrete.
[130:40.29]That's fine.
[130:44.65]Can I, like, run into it?
[130:45.45]Let's, like, move it around.
[130:48.49]Let's jump over it.
[130:50.51]No, it's just gonna be there.
[130:51.27]That's fine.
[130:52.60]It's the way that I push the board.
[130:58.67]So I shouldn't be hitting A to push?
[131:00.85]I should be hitting X?
[131:03.36]Don't press A, press X. What's the main difference?
[131:07.14]Alright, well, that's interesting.
[131:25.64]Alright, let's go do another meat bag mission.
[131:31.57]We converted him.
[131:32.65]See, shit like that, like, I, like, there was no tutorial telling me not to do that.
[131:41.11]Let's go to a body bag.
[131:52.77]I look like a dork?
[131:53.59]Hey, you can't even see me.
[131:54.61]How do you know what I look like?
[131:55.71]Alright, this time we get to jump off a cliff.
[132:04.67]Doesn't matter much.
[132:05.29]Don't sweat it.
[132:12.82]Uh, what am I going to do here?
[132:13.52]Oh, wait.
[132:16.86]Was I not supposed to bail there?
[132:20.52]Spots bailed?
[132:21.30]I guess you get to hit all these spots.
[132:27.34]Or maybe not.
[132:27.86]Okay, no, I was supposed to hit these ones.
[132:34.06]Oh!
[132:37.18]Out of the wood!
[132:38.24]Alright, there's one.
[132:42.15]And... How am I gonna hit that?
[132:47.33]Is there another place I can jump off from?
[132:59.96]He's still doing the... No, I just came back to it.
[133:05.94]Do I just get more speed from here?
[133:09.43]Or do I just bail into all this shit?
[133:12.21]I guess I could just... From here, bail into all this shit.
[133:16.53]No, I guess not.
[133:18.99]Only the hand.
[133:19.55]Yeah, just my hand got hurt.
[133:20.93]What if I stay on it?
[133:22.77]Nope.
[133:24.03]Gonna do the eagle sword.
[133:35.15]Eagle is holding right, right?
[133:39.21]No, it's, uh, is it left?
[133:40.81]Oh, no, it's down.
[133:59.55]Oh, I'm not going to hit it.
[134:00.23]I'm going to hit the thing in the middle.
[134:06.17]This is really awkward without having any sounds, by the way.
[134:08.69]It's just like, I'm just falling flat.
[134:12.95]It's over.
[134:20.80]Can I get these both at the same time?
[134:24.56]No, I can't.
[134:29.30]Oh, I did get it.
[134:29.98]I did.
[134:30.22]I didn't... Okay, that just freaked me out.
[134:31.52]I didn't think I got it.
[134:32.18]Do it.
[134:40.02]These fucking sticks.
[134:47.73]Nooooooo!
[134:57.47]Oh, fuck.
[135:01.81]Spam the royalty free... I'm gonna restart this.
[135:07.48]Bail sooner?
[135:09.10]For some reason, it's whenever I press every button, the left stick, right stick, and the triggers, sometimes it just doesn't work.
[135:15.54]I have to, like, smash it for it to actually work, or do anything.
[135:19.58]I didn't get it, what?
[135:26.21]This one right here.
[135:35.21]Right here, and one right there.
[135:37.99]Did I not get that?
[135:40.71]Meme as soon as you jump?
[135:47.23]Just do a car- I'm just gonna turn this off into a fucking karaoke stream.
[135:52.33]Because I obviously am having extreme trouble playing this game.
[136:06.89]I'm not even, like, having any fun right now.
[136:10.15]Like, I'm just, like, failing.
[136:12.55]We're gonna do another one.
[136:14.53]No, I don't want to upload a- No!
[136:19.94]Get me out of here.
[136:20.70]I'm just gonna play Rock Band and scream the fucking death metal songs.
[136:32.70]As loud as I possibly can.
[136:38.80]Right around the open world.
[136:40.18]Yeah.
[136:40.62]I'll do that before I turn the stream on.
[136:49.08]Please do that.
[136:49.86]Upload it to EA.
[136:51.16]Yeah, I'm going to upload something to EA Nation.
[137:05.72]So, through the roof.
[137:07.13]Did I get it?
[137:10.10]What is it asking me to do here?
[137:11.30]Just kind of... Ah, I see.
[137:14.48]Okay.
[137:16.06]It wants me to land.
[137:18.24]And then... I got caught.
[137:23.45]I got caught in the middle.
[137:24.29]Let me try to get this.
[137:33.95]Oh, boy.
[137:37.22]What?
[137:38.58]That wasn't it?
[137:41.34]I could have sworn that would have been it.
[137:45.24]Nope.
[137:46.64]Let me just take a look.
[137:49.26]What does it, like, want me to do?
[137:53.11]I'm confused right now.
[137:57.27]I have no fucking idea what this one's going to do.
[138:07.11]Uh...
[138:09.32]I'm just going to go Free Skate because this is not going well.
[138:17.06]Do I have to do it?
[138:18.56]Or can I just do it?
[138:20.62]Follow the blue?
[138:21.62]I guess.
[138:22.01]I don't know.
[138:25.13]Getting started.
[138:31.07]Free play.
[138:31.63]There it is.
[138:36.06]Uh, hang ten, Coach Frank.
[138:37.78]I'm gonna be Coach Frank.
[138:39.91]I feel like he's, uh, he's better.
[138:45.19]Do karaoke.
[138:48.67]Uh, free play.
[138:50.41]So we're just in free play now.
[138:57.39]Broke both my ankles.
[139:00.11]That's not a good idea.
[139:01.13]Good thing nobody saw that.
[139:08.83]So how do I get the fuck out of here?
[139:16.53]I'm just gonna jive in the fucking ocean.
[139:25.80]Is there a giant boat over here?
[139:28.26]This sucks without music.
[139:29.32]I know.
[139:29.74]I'm sorry.
[139:33.29]You're gonna add this to top 10 worst streams I've ever done, by the way.
[139:36.85]We have a list going, right?
[139:38.79]Karazhan and then this.
[139:45.65]Start knocking people out.
[139:49.33]Oh, I can swing my board?
[139:50.64]Holy shit.
[139:51.42]That made this so much more fun.
[140:01.26]Go to locations.
[140:02.22]Okay.
[140:06.45]Uh, downtown.
[140:07.29]Let's go downtown.
[140:10.73]Right in the hotel district.
[140:12.91]Why not?
[140:19.86]I gotta buy the $600 clown costume.
[140:21.54]I really do.
[140:23.58]Actually, I gotta get going here in like 20 minutes.
[140:27.88]I got all these fucking things to do.
[140:31.94]Why can I just never have any responsibilities and just play skate and learn how to play it and do good?
[140:46.87]Play the punk music?
[140:48.17]Alright, we'll play the punk music.
[140:52.11]Royalty-free punk playlist.
[140:53.59]Let's turn it on.
[140:57.57]Whatever this one is.
[141:04.86]Wait, I can't even hear it.
[141:05.65]Hold on.
[141:09.71]Did I just get hit by a car?
[141:10.75]I'm not even looking at the fucking game.
[141:19.07]Did you guys hear it?
[141:23.28]Hopefully you can hear this.
[141:27.04]Oh yeah.
[141:28.92]Finally, he's got the shitty punk songs.
[141:30.74]Alright, let's go.
[141:35.71]No, this went to like the worst stream to like a passable mediocre 3 out of 10 stream.
[141:40.40]How about now?
[141:40.92]I wanna ride a car.
[141:48.58]This is punk.
[141:55.07]I can't even hear it.
[141:57.15]I'm gonna grab this car.
[142:00.85]Hold on, I gotta turn the music off.
[142:03.47]Alright, now we just went back to being the shittiest stream ever.
[142:06.49]Music's off.
[142:13.25]Somebody wants me to do this?
[142:16.08]Oh boy, this is great.
[142:19.00]I should have just been doing this.
[142:20.14]Maybe I would get extra points.
[142:30.19]This is causing traffic problems.
[142:36.80]Oh shit.
[142:37.75]It went back to being a terrible stream again.
[142:40.69]What if I do this?
[142:42.43]You think it's funny?
[142:44.37]This used to be a punk stream.
[143:01.02]That guy apparently just beat me up.
[143:03.38]I tripped over the fucking curb and he beat me up apparently.
[143:09.22]Let's go.
[143:13.91]Oh, wow, that was awesome.
[143:21.59]Um, zero out of ten.
[143:24.39]Hey, sometimes, sometimes you, you know, in baseball, let's do a baseball comparison here.
[143:30.41]You know, when a baseball player fails seven out of ten times, that means that, you know, they're fucking one of the greatest baseball players to ever live.
[143:39.23]Now, this is like one of the shittiest livestreams I have ever fucking done.
[143:44.73]In the two years I've been doing this.
[143:48.30]So, I mean, come on, I'm like... I'm batting like 900.
[143:50.74]That's pretty good, right?
[143:57.80]I'm batting like pretty high.
[143:59.47]This is only like the second worst livestream I've ever done.
[144:04.19]Not even true.
[144:04.75]At 300, if you're batting 300 in baseball, you're doing pretty damn good.
[144:17.29]300's great.
[144:17.71]What are you talking about?
[144:18.86]300's fantastic.
[144:22.30]Oh my god.
[144:22.82]This is ripping me around.
[144:23.76]I'm going so fast with this guy.
[144:30.09]Is he going faster because I'm on it?
[144:32.05]Or what?
[144:36.67]Apparently.
[144:40.31]Just do the music and lie down.
[144:41.56]You'll be fine.
[144:46.00]I guess I just didn't comprehend how I was not going to be able to control this game.
[144:53.14]My body and brain cannot control Skate 3.
[144:56.87]It's not going to happen.
[145:01.27]This game is probably so much fun.
[145:04.65]And I'm sure it's like one of the greatest fucking skating games ever made.
[145:08.42]But I can't play it because of the right stick.
[145:13.84]I can do that.
[145:14.38]And I can do this.
[145:15.88]And I can do... I can do this.
[145:18.80]Ow!
[145:23.67]There's cops too?
[145:24.25]Are you serious?
[145:36.19]I wanna go really fast.
[145:40.64]That's all I care about right now.
[145:43.22]How did that lady not get hit?
[145:46.84]I know I'm embarrassing myself.
[145:48.01]I don't need you to tell me that.
[145:53.81]Alright.
[145:54.19]Really fast.
[145:54.71]Really fast.
[145:55.13]Really fast.
[145:56.23]Okay.
[145:56.49]Let go.
[146:02.86]That wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it was going to be.
[146:06.18]Just start punching people.
[146:07.20]Can I get like stars in this game?
[146:15.68]Where are the cops?
[146:21.54]No, we're just playing GTA now.
[146:23.12]I can play GTA if I want to.
[146:24.98]Wait, can I stand on this?
[146:27.36]Alright, let's get going.
[146:31.05]I thought the guy was going to steal that car.
[146:33.77]Nope.
[146:36.87]Are you going to go?
[146:37.41]That guy wants to fight me so bad, but he's not coming up here.
[146:44.98]He's like, get off of there.
[146:45.90]I can sit here and balance on this.
[146:54.37]I got my new skateboard, guys.
[146:56.23]It's a car.
[146:59.65]See how well I can do this?
[147:00.85]I can skateboard on this thing.
[147:04.03]Oh, yeah.
[147:04.72]That was a nice little turn.
[147:05.70]There is a cop coming.
[147:13.92]Is this guy's car doing that?
[147:15.40]Are they parked?
[147:19.22]If you can imagine kick-flipping the car.
[147:23.29]Drive!
[147:24.39]What are you doing?
[147:27.53]I set off this car's alarm.
[147:28.81]What?
[147:29.03]Is there somebody in this?
[147:30.09]There's nobody in this car!
[147:44.49]Whose car is this?
[147:47.95]Okay.
[147:49.35]Well... Let's get in another car.
[147:56.35]Are you also gonna do this?
[147:58.93]Is the car alarm gonna go off?
[148:02.03]No, you're actually gonna drive.
[148:02.93]Good.
[148:07.29]Hell, if a guy was on my car.
[148:08.73]Yeah, I have no idea what the fuck that was.
[148:12.44]I have a feeling I'm going to go too fast and this is eventually going to throw me off, but we'll see as long as we can stay on it.
[148:21.16]Come on.
[148:21.58]Pick up the speed.
[148:25.82]Go.
[148:26.24]Drive faster.
[148:30.34]Come on.
[148:32.76]You can go faster than that.
[148:33.88]I know you can.
[148:34.51]Maybe if I sit on the very edge here.
[148:37.21]There we go.
[148:43.29]because that other car was parked.
[148:46.41]Okay, what if I grab the board?
[148:49.19]Nope.
[148:50.13]That ain't gonna happen.
[148:53.07]Does this do zombie mode?
[148:56.09]Does that actually exist?
[149:00.89]See, this is fun.
[149:01.51]I could get into this if I was any good at the game.
[149:08.68]Is that guy in a... What the hell is that guy riding?
[149:13.23]Just do death race.
[149:18.35]This is the worst stream I've ever seen.
[149:21.41]I know it is.
[149:22.67]Trust me.
[149:23.37]And I'm the guy that's running it.
[149:27.61]Alright, I might as well... I gotta get going, unfortunately.
[149:31.20]I need to be somewhere at 6 o'clock.
[149:34.13]There is a zombie mode.
[149:35.37]Like, maybe I'll come back to this.
[149:36.77]I gotta, like, really learn how to play.
[149:38.03]Uh, I made the mistake of jumping into Skate 3 without ever playing it in my whole life.
[149:46.09]And... Being fucking terrible.
[149:52.60]So, I gotta go meet up with the family.
[149:53.84]There's an important family meeting.
[149:57.00]And, uh... Yeah.
[150:01.26]That was a stream.
[150:03.46]That was a live stream for sure.
[150:07.59]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[150:08.43]I'm going to stream tomorrow.
[150:10.63]Something else.
[150:13.75]Sorry for not knowing how to play when I turned on the stream.
[150:16.43]That was my mistake.
[150:18.99]I figured that it was going to be not as steep as a learning curve as it was.
[150:25.01]So I just embarrassed myself on stream and I'm a fucking idiot and that's all right.
[150:30.74]That's what we do around here though, isn't it?
[150:35.07]But yeah, I'll be live tomorrow.
[150:37.13]I want to do a fill-in stream tomorrow.
[150:39.61]We're going to do something fun tomorrow.
[150:42.76]Not that this wasn't fun.
[150:48.20]Skate 3, by the way, if you're curious, if you're wondering how I'm playing this or why I'm playing this, it just came to backwards compatibility.
[150:54.45]So if you're a huge fan of this game and you're like, oh, what the fuck is going on?
[150:56.69]Why is he playing this?
[150:58.23]I figured I'd give it a try.
[151:00.03]If you have it and you have an Xbox One, put it in.
[151:02.27]Because it'll work.
[151:05.07]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[151:06.55]Same time tomorrow night.
[151:10.79]We will do something fun.
[151:13.65]Before I go, I want to say thanks to StuStuKachu, WagonFire, MrAssassin, Kaiser122, DeitchBlitz, Disco239.
[151:24.70]Thank you guys for your subscriptions.
[151:27.69]Also thanks to RedHeadOrama.
[151:32.30]Thanks for playing games the way no sane person ever would.
[151:36.38]Well, thank you for the 1,000.
[151:37.04]Right ahead.
[151:38.07]Appreciate it.
[151:40.75]And Todd with another 500.
[151:41.69]You guys are too good to me.
[151:45.95]But much love.
[151:47.39]I'll see you guys tomorrow night.
[151:48.47]Same time, 7 o'clock.
[151:50.83]Same normal time, when I mean by that.
[151:54.22]Because everything was just all fucked up today.
[151:56.25]I was going to start later than I was going to start earlier.
[152:00.07]I didn't have Skate.
[152:01.19]I was going to get Skate in the mail and play it a little bit, but I ended up getting it today because I had to stream it.
[152:06.98]I don't know.
[152:07.38]It got all fucked up today.
[152:10.96]Much love.
[152:11.50]Take care, guys.
[152:12.82]I'll see you guys tomorrow night.
[152:14.90]And goodbye.
