[00:33.80]What am I gonna get?
[00:35.66]What am I gonna get?
[00:37.48]What?
[00:38.30]A virtual coat.
[00:39.56]I'm still real cold outside.
[00:41.24]What am I gonna get?
[00:43.49]What am I gonna get?
[00:46.31]That's a snake.
[00:47.25]Wonder what's inside this crate.
[00:49.11]Don't worry, it's more craze.
[00:56.91]We got those crates in the cupboard and glue, you gotta open them up with some super glue, you gotta find a way inside of that crate and pick up a billion hats that you wanna remake, you're gonna craft them, that's what you're gonna do, you're gonna craft them into two, two, two, to find for that hat, gonna give it to you, gonna come around to school, you got the crates, we got the crates, crates, let's the crates, the crates, of the great!
[01:16.08]Holy shit, Jerma, you literally ruined my whole video.
[01:20.84]What, what are you talking about?
[01:21.74]You fu- just the whole thing, like, there's no point anymore.
[01:24.38]What are you talking about, what?! !
[01:26.38]Just don't even use it.
[01:27.20]Just remove it.
[01:28.04]What's the problem?
[01:28.68]I don't get it.
[01:29.60]No, just basically, it's like, why would I, like, you're a horrible person.
[01:34.43]What are you talking about?
[01:37.47]Just delete the clip.
[01:39.07]I can't do it.
[01:39.61]I can't do it when everything's in motion.
[01:41.29]I can't stop this.
[01:42.33]I don't understand, man.
[01:43.67]I made this video a million times better with my classic Run DMC 80s styled rap.
[01:50.59]And if you don't believe that, then that's fine.
[01:51.97]You can just go f*** yourself.
[01:54.64]These are the hats I got, I guess.
[01:56.92]I like the bird.
[01:58.00]Shouldn't put a bird in a crate, though.
[01:59.86]I had to cut it short because obviously Jerma's just gonna come in and, you know, do whatever he wants.
[02:07.22]I got a lot of beards.
[02:09.36]I didn't get an unusual.
[02:10.42]I didn't expect to get one.
[02:12.24]I just thought I'd open the crates for you guys.
[02:16.38]This is why I haven't done any on the last two crates.
[02:18.57]Just every time.
[02:20.81]I'm sorry.
[02:21.25]Bye, guys.
[02:21.75]I'm sorry.
