[00:24.08]Oh, I've been summoned.
[00:25.26]Oh, I've been summoned.
[00:26.41]Hi.
[00:29.87]Did you guys summon me?
[00:32.65]Nice ritual, guys.
[00:37.69]Okay.
[00:38.17]Hello.
[00:40.41]Five minutes late.
[00:41.05]That's not even late.
[00:43.54]Five minutes is not late.
[00:46.42]I could have stepped in a mud puddle and I had to wipe off my feet or something.
[00:51.08]Takes like five minutes if you've got a nice pair of shoes like I do.
[00:55.57]You know?
[00:57.19]You got shoes.
[00:57.85]If you got shoes as nice as mine, we're talking about, uh, Nikes.
[01:03.66]They're, like, they were $39.
[01:04.94]And I got them, like, eight years ago.
[01:10.58]But, sure.
[01:12.36]Hi.
[01:12.74]Yes.
[01:13.00]Gonna play some more Demon's Souls tonight.
[01:19.04]Just continuing to play because I'm enjoying it.
[01:23.33]And let me just make a little tweet and we'll get started.
[01:25.50]Just give me a second.
[01:46.39]Never mind.
[01:47.25]My phone died as I was writing the tweet.
[01:50.25]So we're going to have to do that in a minute.
[01:53.05]I wrote the D in Demon's Souls.
[01:55.45]Man, my phone died.
[01:57.03]And yeah, I know, I know, I know, Jeremy.
[01:58.70]Why are you using your phone?
[01:59.98]Because I don't ever use my desktop computer for any social media.
[02:03.22]Ever.
[02:06.64]What is with this title?
[02:07.54]What's wrong with the title?
[02:09.42]Slathering my blade with a demon aioli.
[02:13.16]Is that bad?
[02:15.36]Slathering my blade with DNA.
[02:18.82]Alright, now that I read it out loud, you may have a point.
[02:26.17]You might have a point there.
[02:29.27]Is this even plugged in?
[02:30.79]I fucking hope so.
[02:33.27]Back to Demon's Souls?
[02:33.89]Yes.
[02:36.49]We've got lots to talk about, guys.
[02:39.85]There's a lot of things to discuss, and I'm going to refrain from them until... Ow!
[02:45.02]My fingertip!
[02:47.88]Let's move this so we... You know, I'm already here.
[02:51.22]Turn this off.
[02:52.72]Excuse me.
[02:53.86]There we are.
[02:57.16]Back to the souls.
[02:57.84]I guess I have 59 Crescent Moon grass.
[03:02.32]Because... I'm a badass.
[03:04.93]So where are we going to go?
[03:09.55]The last thing I did is I beat the flame lurker first try.
[03:12.56]That's right.
[03:15.56]Forgot the face cam.
[03:16.80]Well, don't matter.
[03:21.44]Give me some confidence.
[03:23.30]Alright.
[03:23.98]You want like a confidence tip?
[03:26.24]Here you go.
[03:27.72]Just pretend everybody that you're talking to is pretending that you're naked.
[03:34.36]Makes things way easier.
[03:37.71]He's here now.
[03:38.09]Let's see what he has to say.
[03:39.61]There's no face cam right now.
[03:41.37]I love this guy's voice.
[03:42.86]That's a great tip.
[03:43.34]So you can buy stuff from him.
[03:44.34]Well...
[04:06.09]That's very useful.
[04:08.23]300 for half moon grass.
[04:11.50]He doesn't leave, does he?
[04:14.04]He'll stick around, right?
[04:16.54]With his bag of trash.
[04:20.56]Well, now I know where to get half moon grass.
[04:25.29]Is it a limited time offer?
[04:26.49]Is he gonna leave or what?
[04:32.52]Remember, Jeremy, that there's probably always somebody in the viewers that is watching my stream naked.
[04:37.27]No, that's true.
[04:39.47]Cut that out.
[04:42.29]Let's go try to... I want to go kill this bad guy over here.
[04:48.65]I'll show you the bad guy that I want to try to kill.
[04:51.27]Is it three?
[04:52.48]Was it one-two, was it?
[04:54.86]I think it was one-two.
[04:57.60]I want to go try to fight that tower knight.
[05:05.77]Don't rat me out, Chad.
[05:06.81]What did you do?
[05:12.05]What have you done?
[05:14.87]Thank you, Sticks Renegade, for the $5.
[05:16.27]I can sense it.
[05:16.87]Watching Rat Movie on stream.
[05:20.24]No, we're not doing... What am I, fucking Rick?
[05:22.98]No, we're not going to be watching Rat Movie on stream.
[05:26.42]It's never going to happen ever in the history of every single... Not even BC, not even AD.
[05:30.54]We're not ever going to see it.
[05:31.22]It's never going to happen.
[05:33.49]But thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $5.
[05:34.93]Corvid Boo, thanks for the $3.
[05:36.71]Happy belated birthday.
[05:38.07]Well, thank you.
[05:39.48]Appreciate it.
[05:41.14]I had a nice weekend.
[05:44.34]It was fun.
[05:46.06]Went out and about.
[05:47.10]Left the state.
[05:47.94]You know, left the state of Massachusetts.
[05:50.84]Decided I was gonna get all fucked up.
[05:52.96]No, I didn't.
[05:53.66]Don't worry.
[05:55.38]So I think I gotta go this way.
[05:56.44]Just run right through.
[05:57.82]Ah, Morty!
[06:01.02]I turned myself into Jerma, Morty!
[06:03.90]I don't really have a good morning impression, Morty.
[06:06.91]Except this is Rick.
[06:10.73]I mean, the cadence is a little... This sounds more like Rush Limbaugh.
[06:16.61]Rush Limbaugh.
[06:21.95]John Madden.
[06:24.81]Oh, fuck, there's a dragon.
[06:25.61]I forgot about the dragon.
[06:26.29]I forgot about the dragon.
[06:26.94]He's here.
[06:37.64]Does Rush Limbaugh still do, like, fucking radio?
[06:41.28]Is he still sitting in the chair screaming at people?
[06:43.76]Does he still do that?
[06:54.79]My FPS.
[06:56.91]Yeah, I mean... This is a Demon's Souls 3 game.
[07:03.00]This is a PlayStation 3 game, man.
[07:06.83]Wait, should I just keep running?
[07:07.95]I forget, like, everything that happens down here.
[07:10.15]I probably should remember.
[07:11.17]I haven't played this game in, like, fucking a week and a half.
[07:13.93]I remember you.
[07:14.63]Yeah, I remember you.
[07:19.49]Cinematic.
[07:21.68]31 FPS.
[07:22.26]No, I think it's locked at 30, actually.
[07:26.22]Fairly certain it's locked at 30.
[07:28.50]Demon's Souls 3.
[07:31.82]Demon's Souls 3 is pretty much Bloodborne.
[07:34.38]Or, like, Dark Souls 3.
[07:41.98]Easy, dogs.
[07:44.24]Had enough of your shit.
[07:49.98]Yeah, there's no way this is not locked at 30.
[07:52.75]Hey!
[07:57.53]I wonder if I could just... Can I kill this dragon that's up here?
[08:00.57]I still have to make a tweet that I'm streaming.
[08:04.67]Probably a good idea.
[08:07.17]What did you have?
[08:07.79]Oh, no.
[08:09.25]That's the shopkeeper.
[08:10.61]I have to go back up the stairs.
[08:17.11]Only on PlayStation?
[08:19.40]I wish they would just put this somewhere else.
[08:20.64]So wait, was I not supposed to even come down here?
[08:23.90]Did I run by it?
[08:24.68]In my fucking brainless idiocy, did I run by the thing I needed to go up?
[08:32.73]Or did I need to come down here at all?
[08:36.34]What?
[08:37.10]Wait.
[08:38.00]How is he still here?
[08:38.78]This guy's still down here?
[08:42.44]This is bad.
[08:43.79]How did all of this... Why am I... Didn't I let this guy out, like, fucking... Like... I did.
[08:54.28]Dementia.
[08:54.78]No, I haven't played this game in, like, two weeks!
[08:56.82]I just got back from vacation!
[08:57.94]Give me a break!
[09:08.11]Can you do something here?
[09:12.51]Holy shit, this is a bad player.
[09:18.06]I'm better at Dark Souls than this guy.
[09:20.98]I want to push him off the cliff so bad.
[09:27.80]Why is he coming up here?
[09:28.84]Okay, if this guy dies, is he gone forever?
[09:31.58]I don't know if I want to know the story there.
[09:35.36]I'm killing this dragon.
[09:40.72]Wait a minute.
[09:41.28]Come on.
[09:41.64]I have an idea.
[09:42.24]I'm going to kill the dragon.
[09:48.40]Are you still having trouble down there, man?
[09:52.68]I think I can hit him.
[09:53.42]Let me try to hit him from up here.
[09:59.39]Come on.
[10:06.45]I already tried this last time, did I?
[10:14.93]I didn't hit that?
[10:15.55]Alright, fucking whatever.
[10:16.91]Let's go.
[10:20.49]I, like, fucked it all up already.
[10:21.79]I just, like, don't remember where the fuck I'm supposed to go.
[10:26.19]I know I'm supposed to go, like, down and around, right?
[10:28.03]But, like, I don't... I just don't remember.
[10:31.67]I was here, like, two weeks ago.
[10:33.93]How the fuck am I supposed to remember the hell I'm doing?
[10:39.15]Ugh.
[10:45.93]So it was down and then across, right?
[10:47.79]Like down here.
[10:49.57]Or do I need to run that?
[10:50.59]I just don't remember.
[10:51.33]Because that leads back to there.
[10:57.74]But I suck at the game.
[11:00.54]Everyone's saying that I suck at the game.
[11:03.28]Okay.
[11:03.76]So I suck at the game.
[11:05.52]Is that what people are saying?
[11:07.52]You suck at the game?
[11:09.48]You know, it's funny because I pulled from the last stream something pretty interesting.
[11:14.19]Let me just go ahead and, like... Grab your popcorn, guys!
[11:18.53]Because, uh, does anybody remember this?
[11:56.99]That's right. That's right.
[12:01.01]Before you tell me anything, before you say a goddamn word, remember what happened last time.
[12:09.24]This fucking popcorn is so good, by the way.
[12:39.03]I'm fucking good.
[12:41.07]That's how I eat popcorn.
[12:51.28]Alright, where am I going?
[12:52.54]Where am I going?
[12:53.72]Guy that sucks at game?
[12:55.02]Where am I going?
[13:00.61]Elderly streamer reflects.
[13:03.87]Actually, I want to do something here.
[13:11.88]Where the fuck is it?
[13:12.57]Come here.
[13:17.55]Popcorn is awful.
[13:18.61]What are you talking about?
[13:20.09]Alright, so this guy sells it for 400.
[13:24.12]Pate sells it for 300.
[13:28.38]So... Does Pate ever, ever come back?
[13:34.00]Like, is he gone?
[13:34.83]Like, is he gonna show up there, like, later or something?
[13:43.44]Like, does he actually show up?
[13:47.24]Like, later?
[13:47.88]Or is he gonna leave or something?
[13:54.83]Okay, well, let's go.
[14:00.29]He comes back many times.
[14:01.39]So is it one of those situations where if you talk to him, he's like, I'm gone, bye.
[14:04.87]Well, okay.
[14:09.62]Whatever.
[14:19.65]He leaves for a different game.
[14:25.19]Thanks for the kill.
[14:25.93]Appreciate it.
[14:26.63]Alright, let's, like, fight.
[14:27.67]Hold on a minute.
[14:29.09]Slow it down.
[14:32.27]I don't think I'm going to have enough to beat this guy.
[14:34.83]I've never fought him before, so... I know you're going to blow the dragon fire.
[14:43.27]I'm not safe.
[14:43.87]Here, yes I am.
[14:44.47]Okay, not bad.
[14:50.30]Oh, this might have been a mistake.
[14:53.32]This might have been a little too much of a mistake.
[15:00.40]Just get out of my fucking way, please.
[15:04.85]You dead.
[15:05.63]Alright.
[15:06.25]Half moon grass.
[15:06.85]I got a lot of half moon grass.
[15:10.37]Back it up.
[15:10.91]Back it up.
[15:11.27]Back it up.
[15:11.67]Back it up.
[15:12.07]Back it up.
[15:12.45]Don't fucking die here.
[15:15.03]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[15:15.87]I can do that, too.
[15:22.02]Alright.
[15:23.40]So this is the first time I've killed those guys.
[15:27.80]What does this guy do?
[15:28.90]The last time I tried this, he had, like, a bunch of archers that I had to take care of.
[15:33.95]This is late moon.
[15:34.77]Let's move some of this around.
[15:39.37]Half moon, put the late moon on, and then full moon.
[15:42.59]So much fucking stuff to, like, scroll through.
[15:46.77]What about, like, fire?
[15:47.61]Should I put fire on or anything?
[15:49.11]I'm gonna lose my humanity here.
[15:50.75]Alright, do I have enough to, like, make a tweet that I'm streaming this video game?
[15:54.39]Or what?
[15:56.39]Yeah, I do.
[15:56.85]Hold on.
[15:58.57]Somebody give some money, too, before I go in here and attempt a tower knight.
[16:00.77]Give me one sec.
[16:08.78]Uh, tweet.
[16:10.30]I think it's saved.
[16:11.20]I think it saved my last attempt at a tweet.
[16:17.33]Also, by the way, I had blood drawn today.
[16:20.60]I got a theory for you guys.
[16:21.54]One second, hold on.
[16:30.81]One sec.
[16:41.00]Mm-hmm.
[16:43.94]Oh, more demon sucks.
[16:46.40]No, that's not what I wanted to write.
[16:47.92]Apple.
[16:53.02]There we are.
[16:54.32]So, let me tap this boss and I'm going to give you a theory I have.
[16:58.70]But first, let me say thanks to Ivory for the 20 bucks.
[17:01.44]Happy belated birthday, Jerma.
[17:02.48]Thanks for all the laughs and the past dreams.
[17:04.16]I hope you enjoyed your vacation.
[17:06.14]Since it's been two weeks since you streamed, threw your arms in the air and said, you're crazy.
[17:11.00]Five days since you tackled me, I've... They got the rock burns on both of my knees.
[17:17.77]Two days since you laughed at me and said, don't get hungry.
[17:23.16]Oh, does nothing make you look thing?
[17:24.34]Does it make you stop thing?
[17:25.27]You think you're looking at Aquaman.
[17:26.81]Hey, don't open up things, but I don't make films.
[17:28.91]But they be looking at Aquaman.
[17:32.01]I'm the kind of guy that laughs at a funeral.
[17:38.10]Can't understand what I mean by you know.
[17:41.32]I got the tendency to get my mind on my sleeve.
[17:43.16]I have a history of loose at my shirt.
[17:44.54]It's been one week since you looked at me.
[17:47.16]Stopped your head to the side and said I'm sorry.
[17:50.31]Five days since you laughed at me and said...
[17:56.80]That's done.
[17:57.24]We're done with that.
[17:57.94]I have to concentrate.
[18:00.87]I ran right by him and killed the fucking archers.
[18:03.35]Is that even the right song?
[18:13.07]That's not even the right song, is it?
[18:13.95]What?
[18:16.52]Any more archers?
[18:17.78]Wow, we got a big archer.
[18:19.72]It's the guy down at the bottom.
[18:30.20]This is not going to do anything for me.
[18:32.52]Am I going to be in trouble from this?
[18:34.66]Or am I doing the right thing?
[18:35.82]By the way, I keep thinking that guy is the $100 donation.
[18:39.42]He's going like, alright!
[18:42.94]For a second, I was like, did I just get like $500?
[18:44.24]Alright, that's it, right?
[18:49.78]Now how do I fight you?
[18:51.50]How do I fight the boss?
[18:57.52]Soldiers Lotus.
[18:58.18]Alright, let's focus on you now.
[19:00.36]Can I target you?
[19:01.98]Oh, you have some reach there, sir.
[19:03.74]You do.
[19:05.28]He's got a fucking spear.
[19:06.28]Of course he does.
[19:06.84]Why am I targeting him?
[19:07.59]That's a mistake.
[19:10.97]Big shield.
[19:11.91]Alright, like gas is coming out of him.
[19:19.73]Oh, I mean, I got it.
[19:21.09]I got it.
[19:21.67]I can't fuck it up.
[19:26.62]Okay, I gotta get both of his rocket boots.
[19:28.63]That's definitely what you have to do.
[19:30.43]Through his legs.
[19:30.83]Alright, that's two rocket boots.
[19:35.81]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[19:37.67]Just stay behind him.
[19:47.81]Whoa!
[19:47.93]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[19:48.87]Here comes a big swing.
[19:51.31]Ow.
[19:53.28]I gotta slow down here.
[19:54.58]Slow it down.
[20:05.30]I guess you just have to slowly but surely beat him, right?
[20:13.28]At what point do you pop this guy's tires?
[20:15.05]Whoa!
[20:17.17]I was gonna say, did I pop his tires?
[20:18.49]What do I do?
[20:18.79]Hit him the... This fucking shield is in the way.
[20:21.71]Give me a break.
[20:23.25]I'm stuck here.
[20:25.21]Yeah, I got it.
[20:25.79]Figure it out.
[20:26.49]Yeah, okay.
[20:27.15]Okay, okay, okay.
[20:28.49]I'm gonna pop his tires.
[20:30.27]And you gotta... Yeah, I got it.
[20:32.73]Don't worry.
[20:33.37]Don't worry about me.
[20:38.19]Staying at range is a terrible idea.
[20:39.52]Okay, there's one.
[20:46.72]Don't.
[20:48.44]It's already done.
[20:49.06]Okay.
[20:52.65]Holy shit!
[20:54.15]Oh my god, he's dead!
[20:57.31]Okay, that was fucking... Alright, I figured that out way faster than I probably should have.
[21:07.04]Go after his wiener.
[21:16.49]Well, there he is.
[21:17.73]He's dead.
[21:21.15]Iron Demon Soul.
[21:28.16]First try, blind.
[21:29.08]That's not true.
[21:29.84]I fought this guy once before.
[21:32.05]I walked in here and, like, died to the archers and then he killed me.
[21:34.71]And then I ran around.
[21:35.55]I think I got, like, one hit on him.
[21:37.82]If I remember.
[21:38.64]I don't even remember.
[21:40.94]Okay.
[21:41.62]So, cool.
[21:42.34]I don't know.
[21:47.04]Yeah, I think he... Locked.
[21:50.18]That might have been easier than the big sweaty pig guy.
[21:54.09]Whatever his name was.
[21:56.11]The Albatross?
[21:57.19]What was his name?
[22:01.93]Here comes the dragon.
[22:02.86]Can I get this shit before he... Is the dragon gone now or does he still peruse this area?
[22:09.04]Does he actually come back?
[22:10.14]Or has he now moved on to another area so I can collect all this stuff?
[22:12.64]Seems like that's the case.
[22:16.56]I think it's worth it because it's a lot of grass.
[22:19.17]I don't hear him, so... I do have like 10,000 souls right now.
[22:24.93]He's definitely not here.
[22:26.15]He would have shown up by now.
[22:37.63]Well, I guess I was wrong, but it's okay.
[22:47.52]There's nothing wrong, I'm fine.
[22:53.66]He just took a long time.
[23:01.32]I stood there before and I got hit, so we're good.
[23:06.87]Definitely.
[23:07.37]He is perusing.
[23:08.19]Well, I was like in the middle of the walkway and he didn't show up.
[23:12.07]Okay.
[23:15.97]So, I don't think I should keep going here.
[23:18.08]Let me go back and level up a little bit.
[23:22.10]There's another fog gate here.
[23:26.74]That's a boss fog gate, right?
[23:29.91]Let's just go back.
[23:35.63]I don't want to lose anything.
[23:40.02]Oh, okay, so anyways, so what I was saying before.
[23:43.08]So I got a theory, right?
[23:45.02]So I went, I'll tell you my doctor's office visit today.
[23:48.36]So I went to the doctor.
[23:50.00]And the doctor was like, you know, please come in, please.
[23:53.16]By the way, I was 15 minutes late to my doctor's appointment.
[23:55.69]So I'll let you guys play with that one for a little while.
[23:58.31]I was late to my doctor's appointment.
[23:59.29]It's okay, though.
[23:59.83]It was only like, I was only a few minutes late.
[24:03.69]So I get in, I go there, and I sit down.
[24:06.07]The nurse comes in, and the pre-doctor comes in.
[24:08.29]You know what I mean?
[24:09.35]Get this to 30 strength.
[24:16.34]A pre-doctor comes in and there's somebody with the pre-doctor.
[24:20.22]The nurse that came in, it was training day.
[24:23.38]They were training a bunch of people, a bunch of new people.
[24:26.31]And, you know, whatever, that's fine.
[24:28.39]That's cool.
[24:29.37]So, I got my blood pressure taken by this person.
[24:33.67]And it was alright.
[24:35.13]Okay, good, good, good.
[24:36.05]Congratulations.
[24:36.69]You're in college.
[24:37.41]Good for you.
[24:38.05]Keep it up.
[24:38.48]Keep up the good fucking work, right?
[24:39.64]Okay.
[24:40.58]So go to the... I had to get some lab work done.
[24:42.36]I had to get some blood drawn.
[24:44.38]And there was somebody training there too.
[24:47.04]And they... I'm not going to be mean about this, but... Stuck a needle in my arm.
[24:52.50]Didn't get the vein.
[24:53.42]And the other nurse had to come in and take care of it.
[24:55.74]It's like... That's alright.
[24:58.01]You're learning.
[24:59.03]If you don't have me as a Guinea pig...
[25:01.57]You know, you're not going to learn.
[25:02.71]So I'm okay with that.
[25:03.65]You just stick me in the fucking arm like a couple times and you fucked it up.
[25:06.75]It's alright.
[25:07.61]Somebody else came in and fixed it.
[25:09.49]But, you know, it's okay.
[25:12.31]I was internally sort of upset about that, but you can't be that upset in that situation.
[25:16.60]How are we going to get any more doctors?
[25:19.32]You know?
[25:19.52]We're not going to get any more doctors if we don't at least be okay with that.
[25:24.74]They're not going to learn.
[25:26.40]Anyways, while the blood was being drawn from me,
[25:29.89]I'm going rushing through my brain was just like I I'm I can feel this like this energy being sapped from me Like my brain power went down after I had like I got like a little bit like a lot of blood taken so like I Had like a ton of brain power removed.
[25:46.22]It was I couldn't do math anymore when they took the blood And I thought about it.
[25:49.96]It's like it's not our brains.
[25:50.91]It's blood Right like you think that your brain does all the power.
[25:54.33]No, it's the blood going through your veins in your brain and shit.
[25:57.05]I
[25:58.19]Like, oh no, you gotta, like, make sure to take care of your brain.
[26:00.21]No, take care of your blood.
[26:05.75]Take care of your blood.
[26:08.11]Let's go to 5-1.
[26:13.22]Because I, like, my brain is fine.
[26:16.12]If I lost a little bit of blood, I lost IQ points.
[26:44.34]Yeah, it's your blood.
[26:47.24]Because I was sitting there talking to this person.
[26:49.64]She's sitting there drawing the blood.
[26:51.46]And as it's happening, we're talking about the weather because it's the only thing you talk about when you have nothing to talk about with any other human being.
[26:57.14]Sunny day.
[26:58.08]Yeah.
[26:58.94]And this is what happened.
[26:59.63]I was like, blood's being drawn.
[27:01.35]Needle goes in.
[27:02.07]Blood starts coming out.
[27:03.97]I just, you know, yeah, it's a sunny day out today.
[27:06.77]And at the end of the day, I was going to go to store.
[27:12.51]Store, get food.
[27:14.59]Me like food.
[27:16.09]Me want carrot.
[27:18.59]Carrot, white in mouth.
[27:21.93]And then she took it out.
[27:22.87]And I was like, oh!
[27:24.41]And I went to the cafe afterwards.
[27:27.05]And they, like, had to wheel me out.
[27:28.81]Because, like, I fainted because I'm a wuss.
[27:31.49]They wheeled me out.
[27:32.41]And I was just like, oh!
[27:34.85]I got a coffee and they gave me a muffin.
[27:37.13]And I took one bite of the muffin.
[27:39.15]And like, I can fucking do calculus again.
[27:41.19]You know what I mean?
[27:41.77]It was like, teeth go down.
[27:43.25]I know all my algebra.
[27:46.86]It's about food and it's about blood.
[28:00.64]It's all about the muffin.
[28:01.40]It's the muffin.
[28:02.88]Do you guys know that the muffins have, like, 20% of your daily iron, 40% of your daily calorie intake, 60% vitamin C, and 100% calcium?
[28:15.57]That's in one muffin.
[28:18.85]And, like, you don't hear anybody ever talk about that.
[28:30.84]20% of your daily IQ.
[28:33.08]You get it all when you eat a muffin.
[28:38.38]Alright, this place is freaking me out.
[28:40.18]So this is 5-1.
[28:40.88]40% of your daily calories.
[28:46.02]Yeah, my muffin is like 800 calories.
[28:51.04]That's way too much.
[28:53.20]That is far too much.
[28:59.76]This is the poison place, right?
[29:02.52]With the Muppet enemies.
[29:06.34]I gotta be careful here.
[29:08.70]But so anyways, my point is, so I had blood drawn today.
[29:12.12]And the end of this conversation is like, I'm like a little dumber right now.
[29:15.35]I just am.
[29:16.75]I can feel myself like a little slow.
[29:18.65]Like I'm slowing down.
[29:19.71]Sometimes it takes like an extra second for me to think about something.
[29:23.41]They took my life force today.
[29:27.21]I need that shit.
[29:31.36]You ever think about that?
[29:31.98]Like, when somebody's, like, drawing your blood?
[29:34.42]Like, that's your, like, life essence.
[29:36.30]And they're taking it out of you.
[29:38.17]Like, a bunch of it.
[29:40.03]Sometimes I freak myself out.
[29:41.13]I'm just like, they're draining all my blood.
[29:42.41]They're taking it all.
[29:43.25]I need that shit.
[29:43.91]What's in there?
[29:45.21]How many vitamins did they take with that blood?
[29:55.03]Give it back.
[29:56.93]Yeah, I'm on my way out.
[29:58.77]I grabbed the tray where my blood was, and I just started drinking it.
[30:04.13]I want it back in me!
[30:04.97]Get it back in me!
[30:09.30]Give it back.
[30:11.66]Nah, I'm obviously just fucking around.
[30:19.86]Put it back in.
[30:22.03]Holy shit.
[30:23.39]God.
[30:28.35]I used to be so scared of needles.
[30:30.18]It was a joke.
[30:32.84]I used to lie to the doctor.
[30:35.72]The doctor would be like, when was your last tetanus shot?
[30:39.36]I think it was last week.
[30:40.88]Oh, it doesn't have that in the records.
[30:43.16]Where did you get it done?
[30:43.82]I know, I had it.
[30:44.60]I've got it.
[30:44.98]I've got it done.
[30:45.42]It's like, Jeremy, I think you need it.
[30:48.95]When was the last time you had a measles injection?
[30:50.67]I don't know.
[30:52.59]I'm up to date.
[30:53.81]That's all you have to say.
[30:54.87]Like a fucking dog.
[30:57.54]Say you're up to date.
[30:58.98]No, I'm up to date on everything.
[31:01.18]Oh, you are?
[31:01.66]Yeah, no, I'm up to date.
[31:04.09]Veterinarian.
[31:06.63]You don't have to do that.
[31:13.78]I don't like this place.
[31:14.42]It's too thin.
[31:14.94]You know what I'm saying?
[31:17.78]This place is too thin.
[31:21.06]At least they, like, drop on themselves.
[31:29.59]Up to date.
[31:30.07]Oh, you're up to date on the latest Game of Thrones, Jeremy?
[31:33.31]Did you see Dostregan?
[31:39.47]There's a lady at a... At a CVS I go to.
[31:43.91]That, you know, like, God bless her.
[31:45.27]You know what I mean?
[31:45.69]Like, God bless this lady.
[31:47.15]She just is, like, doing her... She's just working.
[31:48.89]She's just hanging out.
[31:49.43]She's like, we'll have a conversation maybe once in a while.
[31:51.65]That person's alive, by the way.
[31:55.40]Okay.
[31:56.78]But sometimes when I go in there, she's like, Alright, you guys, you guys ever see that Game of Thrones?
[32:04.38]Like, yeah, I have, yeah.
[32:05.68]Wow.
[32:07.22]That's the one with the dragons, right?
[32:09.16]Like, yeah, it is.
[32:10.38]Wow, that's intense, huh?
[32:14.33]She asked me the other day, she's like, you see the new Star Trek?
[32:17.68]I didn't even know there was a new Starcraft.
[32:19.58]I was like, no, I haven't.
[32:22.69]I'm like, oh.
[32:23.67]She's like, oh.
[32:24.19]I'm like, oh.
[32:29.37]Yeah, not going to creep up on me.
[32:34.04]Every voice I make is a variant of Grandpa?
[32:35.92]Yeah, we'll go over them.
[32:37.28]There's this one.
[32:38.24]There's this one.
[32:39.12]There's this one.
[32:40.36]There's this one.
[32:41.92]There's this one.
[32:42.94]There's this one.
[32:44.30]There's this one.
[32:45.66]There's this one.
[32:47.27]And who can forget this one?
[32:48.77]Yeah, no, you're right.
[32:49.67]You're right.
[32:54.00]Yeah, and then I shoved a muffin up my ass.
[32:55.96]So hold on a second.
[32:56.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:57.46]Don't fuck around.
[32:58.20]No joking here.
[33:04.78]This stuff dropped.
[33:05.40]Is it a boss already?
[33:06.64]Or is it just a fog game?
[33:12.53]I can't even see.
[33:13.11]I can't see where I'm even going here.
[33:15.41]I know there's a guy there.
[33:16.23]There's three guys there.
[33:18.29]I actually am more comfortable dropping down that.
[33:21.25]Will they climb up?
[33:21.89]Or are they... No, I'm gonna drop down.
[33:27.25]There's a lot of guys here.
[33:32.45]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[33:33.49]Be easy and do it right.
[33:34.57]This is... Okay, I just got, like, my back scratched.
[33:49.15]Easy.
[33:50.43]Okay.
[33:51.31]I'm looking for stuff.
[33:55.28]You don't put a plank like this out here unless there's an item to grab.
[33:58.64]Right?
[34:01.08]I just... Yeah, I knew it.
[34:02.28]There's an item right here, right?
[34:04.02]No, that's just a dead body.
[34:05.26]Shit.
[34:09.15]Well, I know I shouldn't be standing there.
[34:10.65]That is a mistake.
[34:17.08]So this is where they got the idea for Blighttown.
[34:19.64]The enemies are the same.
[34:21.65]This is the same area.
[34:22.69]And, like, I just felt my head just feel weird because of the blood.
[34:29.77]When do you generate more blood?
[34:32.33]Anybody know?
[34:34.98]Because, like, as human beings, we regenerate.
[34:39.10]Are you kidding me?
[34:40.82]We all talk shit about, like, Wolverine and, like, oh, how cool is that?
[34:43.14]Like, you know how insane that our bodies are?
[34:46.45]If you cut your finger, it grows back.
[34:49.60]Your skin repairs itself and heals itself.
[34:54.20]The day that scientists figure out how to accelerate that process... Like, I've closed my finger on a car door before.
[35:01.32]And you're like, CRUNCH!
[35:03.20]And in any other world, in any other, like, fucking timeline, that finger is broken for life.
[35:08.90]It'll never get fixed.
[35:13.55]That guy was just hiding in the leaves.
[35:15.27]Oh my god, both of you were.
[35:22.15]Can you guys imagine being... In a different world where if you like got a cut it was there forever?
[35:29.81]And you had to permanently have a band-aid on?
[35:33.25]If we just didn't heal, like we didn't have like platelets.
[35:38.31]The world would be a fucking crazy place.
[35:41.01]There's a tick in here.
[35:41.81]There's a fully fed tick in here.
[35:47.23]Getting a bruise on your leg would be catastrophic.
[35:51.24]It'd be like, no, fuck, it's a permanent thing.
[35:53.64]It's there forever.
[35:55.46]I will never get rid of this.
[35:57.88]Somebody like a cat scratches you in the face, it's like, there it is.
[36:00.57]I'm going to be cat scratch face guy for the rest of my life.
[36:05.47]You, like, stub your toe on a desk.
[36:08.35]You have a broken toe forever.
[36:10.75]Fucking modern medicine.
[36:13.02]Huh?
[36:13.66]Huh?
[36:13.94]Huh?
[36:14.30]Huh?
[36:15.92]What happened?
[36:16.38]I can't move.
[36:19.86]I don't think I can move.
[36:20.52]I think I royally fucked myself.
[36:23.44]Wow.
[36:24.10]That was fucking lucky.
[36:25.84]Wait, no it wasn't.
[36:28.30]Wait, how do I get this and not fall?
[36:30.14]Am I gonna fall through this little hole?
[36:32.32]No, I guess I am.
[36:33.92]I gotta go this way.
[36:39.76]Saints robes, just trash.
[36:53.09]Hey, why did you take my hat from Mario 64, monkey guy?
[36:56.77]I just slipped on a banana peel in Mario Kart.
[37:01.51]Is that a tongue?
[37:09.69]These things are so slippery.
[37:14.21]Is that a guy under there or is that just part of his arm?
[37:16.30]I don't know.
[37:17.76]How do I deal with the ticks?
[37:24.46]These guys are going to explode, right?
[37:31.37]That's it?
[37:33.93]You just blow them up?
[37:34.79]You just break their blood sacks?
[37:39.01]I feel like that does something if I touch that.
[37:40.51]I shouldn't be.
[37:40.99]I don't know.
[37:44.33]I don't like this.
[37:45.19]Everything on the ground is so dark and blended in with itself.
[37:48.85]This looks like a painting on the ground.
[37:51.21]I don't know, like, where I can stand and where I can't stand because of the fucking 720p PlayStation 3 painting that is covering the floor.
[37:59.37]The floor is lava.
[37:59.97]You know what I mean?
[38:00.55]The floor is lava.
[38:05.12]Go get your blood back.
[38:07.15]Reduces my max HP.
[38:09.42]What a bunch of fucking idiots.
[38:13.82]I need to... Is that a bad guy?
[38:19.52]There's like a Star Trek character down there.
[38:22.07]We're on Star Trek today.
[38:23.43]I've heard about Discovery.
[38:24.41]I know it exists.
[38:29.99]I can't tell.
[38:30.41]I don't know.
[38:30.75]Is he going to start swinging at me?
[38:31.89]This is like a merchant.
[38:37.95]Why are you just like the little boy from where the wild things are?
[38:41.13]I got so many references.
[38:42.13]You don't even have fucking any idea.
[38:43.43]Won't you buy something?
[38:45.11]My poor child is hungry.
[38:46.81]I don't know.
[38:51.77]No thanks.
[38:55.38]Mace, Warpick, Halberd, Talisman of God.
[38:58.68]Chainmail.
[38:59.28]I mean... You don't really have anything I want.
[39:02.80]Curse this.
[39:03.32]I wasted my breath on you.
[39:05.60]Did that witch send you to torment me?
[39:09.52]Should I kick her off the mountain?
[39:16.50]Where is this child she speaks of?
[39:18.20]I think she's making it up.
[39:22.34]Why would a mother abandon her child?
[39:24.79]Where is he?
[39:25.37]Where is she?
[39:27.77]I don't believe you.
[39:29.37]Please buy another for the poor child.
[39:34.54]Yeah, you know why she's not going to stand up?
[39:36.20]Because she's got like a big bug tick egg sack under there.
[39:38.15]I have a lot of those lotuses, so I'm not concerned.
[39:39.77]The price of survival can never be too high, can it?
[39:57.26]Um, let me just take a look again.
[39:58.42]Yeah, so you sell this lotus.
[40:00.32]Heal from plague, heal from poison.
[40:01.68]I have a lot of these.
[40:02.84]I've been collecting them the whole game.
[40:04.46]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:05.90]Alright, so I just keep going down?
[40:08.66]Are those rats down there, or are those moles?
[40:14.64]Um... Well, I think I have to go down there, but I've got to be prepared because the floor is going to drop on me, I think.
[40:22.03]Nope, not quite.
[40:23.09]Okay, watch out.
[40:25.72]Oh boy.
[40:26.70]I'm getting the shield up for this one, guys.
[40:28.10]I ain't dealing with a bunch of fucking moles.
[40:31.93]One at a time now.
[40:34.51]Are you fucking serious?!
[40:38.79]You can't be serious!
[40:41.49]That was so stupid!
[40:46.71]I go for a swing at a... I have to... What does the plague mean?
[40:51.65]Oh my fucking god, can you please...
[40:54.87]What does the plague do?
[40:59.47]What does the plague?
[41:02.97]Is it like in the other games?
[41:03.89]Is it just toxic?
[41:04.61]I'm kind of healing.
[41:06.11]I guess I have to get rid of it, right?
[41:09.31]It's toxic from the other games, right?
[41:14.76]So I need to get rid of it then, like right now.
[41:16.22]Let's heal the user from the plague.
[41:19.34]Yes, use it.
[41:24.69]I have regen, but I would rather not have to deal with that.
[41:28.82]It's expensive, too.
[41:30.10]Fuck me.
[41:30.78]Okay, now I know why everyone goes... Jeremy, Vial of Defilement.
[41:35.44]The Vial of Defilement.
[41:36.54]What's the name of this place?
[41:40.20]I'm not even saying it right.
[41:41.80]What's the name of this zone?
[41:48.70]Moon, Half Moon, Late Moon, and then some... Poison...
[42:00.70]Green Hill Zone.
[42:03.02]That's Angel Island Zone.
[42:03.74]Sorry for all you gamer dorks out there.
[42:05.26]I got it wrong.
[42:05.82]Yeah, that's what I want to look at.
[42:07.84]Inside of the rat.
[42:25.42]I don't think I didn't just run through here.
[42:26.84]Is it gonna happen again?
[42:29.04]Is there a guy that throws rocks?
[42:30.84]There's a guy with a big club and a tongue.
[42:33.56]And there's a rock person up there.
[42:35.84]I'm so glad that those two fucking Swedish meatballs didn't hit me.
[42:39.28]I would have been so angry.
[42:42.30]Okay, what's right here?
[42:43.17]Nothing?
[42:44.05]Is this safe?
[42:45.15]Oh, shit in my... Shit!
[42:51.15]Fight him in here.
[42:51.55]Where there's at least a little bit of space.
[42:59.04]That wasn't a backstab?
[42:59.94]Shit.
[43:09.20]Another guy, another guy, another guy.
[43:10.22]Where is he?
[43:11.91]Out of here.
[43:15.45]Okay, um, I'm gonna be here.
[43:17.05]This is like reference Wednesday.
[43:19.47]You guys ever play Xenoclash?
[43:22.73]Whoever has played Xenoclash?
[43:25.35]That's, that's Mother Father.
[43:27.03]Or Father Mother.
[43:28.26]That's who, I'm trying to think about who the fuck that was.
[43:30.78]That is Father Mother from Xenoclash.
[43:32.26]If you don't get that reference, that's fine.
[43:34.30]Nobody, like, that was like a game that not very many people played.
[43:39.54]But, that's the one reference I can make.
[43:41.29]Reference Wednesday.
[43:47.61]What am I thinking?
[43:54.56]Wow.
[44:04.43]The reach on this thing.
[44:05.28]I love the spread.
[44:07.72]It feels so nice doing that.
[44:10.04]Grass.
[44:10.36]I have so much of this crescent moon grass now.
[44:13.76]You want to play that game, honestly?
[44:17.50]It's... It's alright.
[44:20.17]It's one of those games where it's just really weird.
[44:23.81]And it's just, hey, this game's fucking weird.
[44:27.71]But it kind of works at the same time.
[44:31.43]I would say it's a solid, like...
[44:33.66]Like, check it out.
[44:35.38]Not so sure about the second one.
[44:37.19]And now I'm poisoned.
[44:37.91]Might as well get it over with.
[44:43.91]I'm dying.
[44:57.16]Eat it up.
[44:58.36]I am.
[45:01.24]What else is down here?
[45:02.38]Oh, I don't like this.
[45:03.18]I don't like how... There's another... There's another father and mother over there.
[45:10.55]I don't like the noise you're making.
[45:11.55]You have to go away.
[45:19.91]The tick sounds, yeah.
[45:20.91]I don't like them.
[45:22.55]It's a daisy.
[45:25.79]Just gotta take it slow.
[45:28.98]I can't fall from here, but I'm not fighting on the bridge.
[45:31.32]Not a chance in hell.
[45:33.80]Pull them back.
[45:34.46]Get them one at a time.
[45:36.94]Play this smart, please.
[45:45.05]I thought Blighttown was in the other game.
[45:46.33]That's what I was saying.
[45:47.29]It's funny because Blighttown is what made me not want to play Dark Souls 1 anymore.
[45:51.89]And so far, I went through all of Blighttown.
[45:54.23]And I was like, oh, that was great.
[45:55.61]And then I didn't want to go back.
[46:03.81]Alright, come on, father-mother.
[46:04.89]Let's go.
[46:09.51]Don't... No rolling, sir.
[46:11.91]Please do not roll.
[46:17.25]No backstab there?
[46:19.95]Where's my backstab?
[46:29.75]Come on.
[46:30.28]I thought I had the upper hand there.
[46:34.57]You never actually played... I've never actually replayed Blighttown since the first time I played it.
[46:40.86]Blighttown was... This is not as bad as Blighttown.
[46:43.58]Blighttown was a fucking nightmare.
[46:46.46]It was an absolute nightmare.
[46:48.95]It had like a bunch of levels.
[46:50.33]There was an up-down, like the big boxes, the big square, like huts and shit.
[46:54.43]Never again.
[46:55.13]Never again.
[46:57.36]If I play Dark Souls... If I play Dark Souls 1, that's one of those situations where I want to hand the controller to somebody and have somebody do a save file for me.
[47:07.24]And they complete Blighttown and give it back.
[47:11.34]Full moon grass.
[47:12.88]Is this a boss?
[47:13.40]I'm kind of concerned about this.
[47:19.82]Blighttown's only good with a master key.
[47:23.28]This gets much worse.
[47:26.83]Look up.
[47:28.34]Well.
[47:31.46]Is there anything I can do to make this faster, or do I need to just kind of sprint down here?
[47:42.07]I guess I can... This wasn't too bad of a trek, I don't think.
[47:46.86]Let's see what this is.
[47:49.20]Oh, fuck me.
[47:52.08]What the fuck is this?
[47:58.93]You're a giant, like, blob enemy.
[48:00.38]I've already... Okay.
[48:05.88]You're a giant snake tongue.
[48:12.17]Um... Well, I sure would like to know how to fight you.
[48:16.41]I don't, but let... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:19.53]What happened?
[48:20.17]What?
[48:21.11]Wait, wait.
[48:24.34]I thought it was...
[48:33.44]No, oh look at my fucking health.
[48:36.60]Why?
[48:39.82]Oh my god Actually blind I thought it was like a you drop into the area like all the fucking half the other bosses in this game Remember like Dark Souls, maybe you drop down like the giant well in Dark Souls 3.
[48:59.64]I don't fucking know
[49:07.28]Fuck me.
[49:17.81]Where is it?
[49:20.41]Where is it?
[49:27.86]Well, how's the fastest way to get back there?
[49:29.94]I am fucking so... Come on.
[49:35.73]And it's pitch black.
[49:36.83]I just thought I had to drop down or something.
[49:38.95]Like, how do I get back there fast?
[49:44.00]It's not very many souls.
[49:45.02]Like, I don't really care.
[49:45.84]Like, where do I need to go?
[49:49.24]I gotta, like, drop down there, right?
[49:54.76]Straight over here.
[49:55.52]And then what?
[49:58.58]Like, can I drop down this way?
[50:04.24]Oh, this sucks.
[50:05.26]This sucks.
[50:06.68]This sucks having, like, fucking half my health taken away.
[50:09.06]Alright.
[50:14.94]How do I get down quick?
[50:17.38]It's not here.
[50:32.93]I could use the eyes.
[50:38.15]And I can get this item that I didn't get before.
[50:39.97]Fucking walking off cliffs and shit.
[50:47.16]Give me this.
[50:58.14]Morning Star.
[51:00.22]I knew you were gonna do that.
[51:07.43]Like, please.
[51:08.65]Don't whack your hand into that shit.
[51:12.77]I need long fall boots.
[51:18.90]Oh, shit.
[51:21.24]Oh, shit.
[51:21.98]Oh, fuck.
[51:34.98]Uh, huh?
[51:35.94]Okay, we're fine.
[51:36.66]We're okay.
[51:37.20]Everything's fine.
[51:37.84]Get out of the fucking way.
[51:49.93]Get out of my way.
[51:50.55]There's people behind me now.
[51:51.39]Get out of the fucking way.
[51:53.75]There's people fucking behind me now.
[51:56.29]Get out of the fucking way.
[52:01.15]Oh my god, I'm being chased by fucking 500 million people.
[52:10.96]Oh.
[52:12.04]Oh.
[52:12.24]Where?
[52:12.58]Drop?
[52:13.12]No.
[52:15.60]I'm so fucking paranoid.
[52:22.93]I like don't- I can't see.
[52:24.27]I can't see where I need to go.
[52:30.11]Over here.
[52:30.51]Here's like the fucking ticks.
[52:36.13]I-
[52:43.63]Honestly, I'm just trying to get down.
[52:47.00]I'm with this lady.
[52:50.26]Oh, fuck the rats.
[52:56.84]I gave up.
[52:57.78]I just gave up and I fucking ran.
[53:06.47]I gave up.
[53:07.19]Who is fucking running?
[53:07.87]Who cares?
[53:08.27]Shit, get out of the way.
[53:10.98]I don't care.
[53:14.27]I don't care.
[53:14.59]Where am I going?
[53:15.33]Where am I?
[53:19.63]Oh fuck, there's a guy behind me too, isn't there?
[53:24.89]Oh fuck, I'm poisoned!
[53:32.97]Everything's fine.
[53:39.74]You gotta get the fuck out of the way.
[53:54.94]I need to figure out, like, the actual fucking way to get down here.
[54:00.42]Okay.
[54:01.08]Get... Go through the door.
[54:02.30]Go through the fog gate.
[54:04.56]Alright.
[54:05.12]Don't fall this time.
[54:07.42]Let me take a look.
[54:09.08]Okay.
[54:09.28]I gotta go this way.
[54:10.90]Everybody be careful.
[54:15.70]Right?
[54:19.48]I don't know.
[54:21.02]I guess I have to go... How the fuck am I supposed to... I have to run around this, like, carousel?
[54:30.02]I just have to drop down, like, a bunch of times?
[54:36.63]He spits, like, poison at you.
[54:41.89]I need to get, like, a good look at this.
[54:43.01]So it's over here.
[54:45.07]And then, like, over here.
[54:48.41]Okay, here we are.
[54:50.07]Made it.
[54:51.95]The leechmonger.
[54:52.83]Alright, everybody quiet.
[54:58.51]Let me see what he does.
[55:06.72]Wow, okay.
[55:07.72]Wow!
[55:09.92]Covering leeches.
[55:15.06]Okay, let's see.
[55:18.59]I still have leeches on me.
[55:23.47]I'm, like, stuck in... Ah, these fucking boards are so stupid.
[55:27.71]Get out of the fucking way.
[55:29.88]I have, like, diarrhea pants on, too.
[55:31.72]This is great.
[55:32.30]Alright, I got him.
[55:34.92]Let's heal.
[55:47.52]I think I just have to block that.
[55:56.29]Is he healing?
[55:58.45]Or have I lost my mind completely?
[56:07.11]Fuck.
[56:07.49]These little debris, man.
[56:08.56]Get out of the fucking way.
[56:13.80]I gotta get away from this front.
[56:16.76]I still have these fucking pants on.
[56:28.06]Oh, that was a mistake.
[56:28.88]Move around.
[56:33.37]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[56:34.61]Don't you fucking dare.
[56:47.50]I don't know what that is.
[56:49.87]He's showing me his stomach.
[56:52.03]Oh!
[57:00.59]Well, I didn't know he did the fucking windmill.
[57:10.20]I think I have to, like, break shit off of him.
[57:12.38]I do.
[57:22.98]Back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up stupid I think he has like more strength if he has like leeches on He is healing I
[57:49.00]Slow and steady.
[57:50.28]He's gonna do something fucking dumb.
[57:51.50]Yep, there it is.
[57:55.08]Get out of the... Get out of the fucking way!
[57:57.10]Oh, there's so much stuff to run into here.
[57:58.38]I hate it.
[57:58.70]What is that?
[58:10.83]What is that?
[58:14.47]I figured it out.
[58:15.09]You gotta hit him when he heals like that.
[58:17.93]I figured it out.
[58:18.43]I got it.
[58:18.69]I know.
[58:19.37]I got it.
[58:19.55]I got it.
[58:19.73]I got it.
[58:19.95]I got it.
[58:21.23]ABC.
[58:25.25]ABCmouse.com - sponsored stream.
[58:36.10]That's fine.
[58:45.46]Greedy.
[58:46.34]Don't be greedy.
[58:49.19]Be greedy!
[58:51.39]Come on, kill him before he can do it!
[58:53.11]Come on!
[58:54.69]ABCmouse!
[58:56.61]ABCmouse.com!
[59:00.16]I did it.
[59:13.52]Whew!
[59:15.84]Okay.
[59:16.04]Got him.
[59:20.80]Kinda first try.
[59:21.76]That was a first try.
[59:24.10]I'm gonna say first try.
[59:26.26]I am.
[59:27.98]People might not want to agree with that, but I was my own first try.
[59:33.68]So I opened up the fog gate, and I was the boss.
[59:36.36]And I pushed myself through the mirror.
[59:39.44]Right?
[59:39.64]Like, I looked in the mirror, and I was, like, doing my hair, and I was like, No, you are the evil one!
[59:44.28]And he pushed through the fucking mirror, and I... I fell back into the fucking well.
[59:48.77]I had to fight myself that time.
[59:56.83]That should count as a first try.
[59:58.89]Come on, I didn't... What am I... How am I supposed to know?
[60:04.45]Raid club?
[60:04.87]There's so much random shit here.
[60:10.56]That can't be how it happened.
[60:11.74]Well, it is.
[60:12.26]I should get fate so I can use the meat cleaver.
[60:18.94]Um... I don't know.
[60:20.72]I don't know if I want to.
[60:21.52]On my first ever playthrough of this game, I don't think I want to, like, waste points in fate.
[60:26.82]Now, that might not be a waste to a lot of you guys, but... I... What am I?
[60:31.28]The halfway point of the game?
[60:32.64]How far am I into the game?
[60:34.74]Like, just about halfway.
[60:35.80]Just a little over halfway.
[60:37.86]I feel like I want to just be standard and, like, do a build.
[60:41.80]Like, a strength build.
[60:43.08]And not worry about other points.
[60:50.07]The meat cleaver is so good.
[60:51.75]Keep the faith.
[60:52.99]And about halfway.
[60:54.69]This is the tutorial.
[60:58.89]Well.
[61:00.33]That was a difficult tutorial, if that's the case.
[61:06.86]Wriggling Demon Soul.
[61:11.64]So, I... I've feet.
[61:15.96]I've feet.
[61:17.98]You know, guys, I have feet.
[61:20.94]I have them.
[61:22.96]This is dangerous.
[61:24.07]I'm gonna go through this first.
[61:28.85]Still at the loading screen?
[61:29.97]Yeah.
[61:33.01]Let's just go back.
[61:39.32]Is this game as bad as the last one you played?
[61:41.12]Oh, no.
[61:41.40]Demon's Souls is a classic, man.
[61:43.78]This game's good.
[61:44.56]This game's very good.
[61:51.35]5-2 is hot garbage, is it really?
[61:53.43]Great.
[61:56.57]So these Demon's Souls, I'm going to crush them because I don't think I need them.
[61:59.92]What do you get for these?
[62:00.68]Let me see what I got here.
[62:02.74]Wriggling Iron and Lead.
[62:04.86]What's the weapon you get for these?
[62:08.77]I'm going to assume, because I'm doing a strength build, that I don't think I need any of these.
[62:16.98]I haven't done 1-2 yet.
[62:18.66]I did.
[62:19.96]I did do 1-2.
[62:23.82]I beat Mr. Tower Knight.
[62:28.09]5-2 is the worst.
[62:28.71]It's almost as bad as 2-2.
[62:29.61]Oh, well.
[62:34.55]I didn't have much trouble with the 2-2 area, did I?
[62:36.94]I don't remember.
[62:37.46]I may have.
[62:40.16]I had the most trouble with 4-1, if I'm gonna be honest.
[62:42.76]Like, I'm that much of a fucking, like, weirdo.
[62:46.92]I want endurance.
[62:50.99]It's starting to get expensive to level up, so... I need to be more careful of what I spend my time.
[62:57.71]I think I'm gonna crush them.
[63:04.65]Look, if I want to go weird, I have the meat cleaver.
[63:08.17]How am I not curious to see the boss weapons?
[63:11.50]I mean... Actually, you know you're right.
[63:13.76]I'm getting a fucking phone call right now.
[63:17.70]I can't talk to you right now.
[63:20.13]Like, are you serious?
[63:22.17]Oh, wait a minute.
[63:24.09]Actually, I do need to answer this.
[63:25.03]Hold on, give me one second, guys.
[63:57.61]Okay, uh, good news.
[63:59.21]Uh, good news, I'm not anemic.
[64:01.75]Good, okay, we're fine.
[64:02.93]Now that means I can stream.
[64:04.03]Okay, good.
[64:06.77]Well, that was my, like, lab results.
[64:09.63]Everything's normal.
[64:11.73]Iron levels are okay.
[64:15.65]Good to know.
[64:17.86]Hi, hi, this is Sus.
[64:20.06]This is the nurse.
[64:25.55]This is the Sus command calling you.
[64:29.81]You're late to your stream.
[64:31.33]Hello, I'm keeping.
[64:33.09]Imagine you could dial, like, Sus in here.
[64:35.95]Like, what time the stream is.
[64:37.09]How I ended up.
[64:38.13]Why didn't... Hello, this is the Sus pre-doctor.
[64:44.88]You have a heart of gold.
[64:50.05]Uhhh, do I?
[64:50.79]What am I gonna do?
[64:56.86]You rid it as soos?
[64:58.82]I see it as sus.
[65:01.64]Where the hell do I want to go?
[65:03.58]It's kind of open at this point.
[65:04.50]Should I do 1, 3?
[65:05.50]2, 3?
[65:07.02]4, 2?
[65:07.40]I could do 3, 2?
[65:11.71]Oh, I want to look at the, um, the boss weapons first.
[65:19.82]Where was that here, right?
[65:29.61]3, 4, and then 2.
[65:30.23]I should do 1, 3.
[65:35.29]2, 3 is just a boss fight.
[65:39.66]I'll do... We'll do 2, 3.
[65:40.24]Let's get in there.
[65:44.53]In a minute, though, let's, well, I have a second.
[65:46.59]King Roy, thanks for the bits.
[65:47.97]Healthy Germany.
[65:48.59]Yes, thank you.
[65:49.39]Appreciate it.
[65:50.73]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $5.
[65:52.01]If you won't watch Rat Movie on stream, can you at least dab on stream?
[65:57.92]That's a double no, man.
[66:00.56]I don't like to double no people.
[66:03.00]Usually I'm one of those kind of guys where if you say something, you ask me to do something, and I don't want to do it, like, I'll one-no you.
[66:11.11]asked me for something else I I don't I don't typically double no like no and then no no usually you get a yes in there not this time you got double no great club what can you how do you just trying to see if I have anything to turn these into
[66:38.95]Um... Nah, I'm just going to smash him.
[66:43.35]I mean, let me go to the Demon's Souls Wikipedia page and see what these give you.
[66:48.63]Because, I mean, it's the same deal, right?
[66:52.30]Okay, let's type in Iron Demon's Soul.
[66:55.58]What do you get for this?
[67:02.44]Oh, you get this.
[67:05.99]Okay, this one's a spell.
[67:07.13]Cheating!
[67:08.63]This is not cheating.
[67:10.89]You're allowed to look up what this is.
[67:16.11]So you're cheating.
[67:16.87]No, I'm only looking up what these give you.
[67:21.75]I don't know anything else.
[67:26.00]This is not cheating.
[67:27.16]This is the only thing I've ever looked up on Demon's Salt.
[67:30.06]That's not true.
[67:31.78]I looked up what World Tendency was because I fucking have no, I had no absolute clue what the fuck was going on.
[67:38.89]And guess what?
[67:39.83]I read the whole page on World Tendency.
[67:42.43]I still have no idea what the fuck is going on.
[67:45.21]So it didn't help.
[67:45.97]Anyways, this thing is, this is for a spell.
[67:49.61]So I'm not doing it.
[67:51.29]This is for like the spell warning.
[67:53.65]I'm not a magician.
[67:54.87]Get it out of here.
[67:55.91]Crush it.
[68:01.68]Not even the devs know what it is.
[68:06.03]This is gone.
[68:07.71]See you later.
[68:12.47]Presto majesto.
[68:13.47]Give me the souls.
[68:14.07]Alright, we got wriggling.
[68:20.51]What's the wriggling demon soul?
[68:26.58]Wriggling demon soul.
[68:31.07]Alright, so this is like pure poison cloud magic.
[68:35.09]Get it out of here.
[68:37.75]Get it out of here.
[68:38.63]I don't need poison.
[68:42.45]Look, I'm going to get to level up like twice.
[68:43.93]That's fucking way better.
[68:46.86]Lead Demon Soul.
[68:51.78]Lead Demon Soul.
[68:56.08]Jeez, this is for a spear.
[68:59.49]Scraping spear.
[69:01.21]Looks kind of cool.
[69:03.43]Looks pretty cool here.
[69:04.52]I don't know.
[69:07.04]Hmm.
[69:08.98]Hmm.
[69:09.30]I don't know about this one.
[69:11.36]This kind of looks cool.
[69:12.52]Hmm.
[69:12.92]I'm going to hold on to this one.
[69:17.97]But we're going to take these out.
[69:22.47]Somebody said LLL scraping spear.
[69:24.35]Is it not good?
[69:24.99]You have a problem with the scraping spear?
[69:28.87]We got a problem with the dentist scraping tool?
[69:35.23]I should upgrade the shield.
[69:36.47]Can you actually do that?
[69:39.83]It's the ultimate troll weapon in PvP.
[69:45.24]Well, I don't think I'm gonna be PvPing.
[69:53.18]Dark Healer's Shield.
[69:54.92]Should I upgrade this?
[69:58.10]I can't.
[69:58.88]I need a colorless demon soul for this.
[70:03.04]Man, I can't do crushing clay more.
[70:04.86]I need four more gray stones.
[70:09.04]So, see you later.
[70:10.24]Repair, ah... Just get it out of the way so I don't have to... That's the last thing I need is for me to forget about all this shit.
[70:18.14]Fuck, it's really that broken, huh?
[70:21.44]Yeah, I know I'll forget about this and it'll break in the middle of a fight and I'll be like, What?
[70:24.84]What happened?
[70:25.42]What happened to my stuff?
[70:26.70]Well done.
[70:28.24]You guys know that'll happen, so let's go level up.
[70:32.20]Does anybody even play this game?
[70:35.14]There's no way.
[70:35.82]There's no way anybody still plays this game online.
[70:40.85]And if they do, then I will eat my words.
[70:42.65]Alright, should I level up or should I buy a ton of half moon grass?
[70:49.73]I think I'm gonna buy an absolute shitload of half moon grass.
[70:52.11]Yeah.
[70:53.13]Call me dumb.
[70:53.89]Go for it.
[70:55.41]This is MY playthrough, you know what I mean?
[70:57.33]This is ME playing game.
[71:01.68]Oh, by the way, need to make sure that I tell you guys this because I have enough people here where, you know, everyone's kind of here.
[71:09.04]There will be no stream next Tuesday.
[71:12.73]So no stream next Tuesday.
[71:14.33]I'm going to be in Los Angeles.
[71:17.29]I will be in LA talking business.
[71:21.05]Talking business, yes.
[71:24.33]I have nothing to say.
[71:25.61]I have nothing to announce.
[71:27.21]Nothing is set in stone.
[71:29.19]But I will be in LA this weekend to discuss a bunch of things.
[71:32.83]So, nothing to talk about yet.
[71:35.99]And there might not be anything to talk about.
[71:37.49]I don't know.
[71:39.41]I'm not going to be streaming next week on Tuesday.
[71:44.82]So, there has been a lot of streams being removed for the last week or two.
[71:50.64]And that's not anything I ever want to do.
[71:53.70]But I've been kind of busy.
[71:57.66]And it'll all go back to normal, don't worry.
[72:01.48]After next week... And that's not even true, because TwitchCon is in the end of October.
[72:06.23]Look, it's going to go back... In November, we'll get the normal streams again, alright?
[72:13.37]So should I go buy like 40 half-grass?
[72:19.08]Oh, big businessman thinks he's too good now.
[72:23.60]It's worth it in the long run.
[72:26.19]What's worth it?
[72:28.77]So you guys don't think I should just go buy a ton of these right now?
[72:32.69]I kind of need them.
[72:36.35]How many can I get?
[72:36.85]I could get 39 of these.
[72:37.43]Or I could get 23 late moon grass.
[72:38.55]Like 39?
[72:38.79]That's a lot.
[72:41.25]I'll never have to buy them again.
[72:55.09]I could buy this guy's entire stock.
[72:59.42]Don't do it.
[73:00.92]You should do it.
[73:01.50]I think I should, right?
[73:04.56]Just level once and buy the rest.
[73:06.00]Oh, yeah, that's a smart idea.
[73:08.72]See, I need you when I go to the casino.
[73:11.65]I need you, I need somebody to grab my hand and just like take like the $500 hand of Baccarat that I'm going to play and be like, dude, no, just dude, go buy like food, go eat dinner, go like relax and play a slot machine for like 20 minutes and then put like $150 on one hand of Baccarat.
[73:27.47]And I'd be like, you know what?
[73:28.37]You're right.
[73:33.11]Where is this lady?
[73:39.14]Yeah, the meat cleaver can't be upgraded.
[73:40.49]She's just sitting there twiddling her feet.
[73:45.01]What is that?
[73:45.63]This is the stream where we're just talking about feet.
[73:51.39]It's the point of topic.
[73:54.82]Alright, what do you think?
[73:56.14]Uh, vitality?
[73:56.98]Let's do vitality.
[74:00.08]And then we're gonna buy the rest.
[74:02.94]We're gonna buy mood halfway.
[74:08.07]No, I just... I just, like, shattered his groceries.
[74:11.07]I'm sorry, dude.
[74:12.40]That's good.
[74:12.86]Okay.
[74:18.84]Alright.
[74:20.56]I got... I got enough healing.
[74:22.04]I've got so many of these.
[74:23.12]I almost want to sell them back.
[74:26.48]So, let's... One three or two three?
[74:32.37]Let's do two three.
[74:33.69]Two three.
[74:35.15]Let's give it a go.
[74:45.73]Somebody said, what the hell is wrong with me?
[74:47.05]I don't know.
[74:50.00]Thank you, R.I.P.
[74:51.56]Rip Dark Souls 2 for the 10 bucks.
[74:53.78]Pure white tendency enemies are easier to kill, but drop fewer, less valuable items and hold the least number of souls.
[74:59.98]Healing items are dropped more frequently.
[75:01.64]Love you.
[75:01.92]Well, thanks a lot, Dark Souls 2.
[75:03.28]Rip Dark Souls 2.
[75:03.80]Yeah, and if you have the dark world tendency, up in the top right.
[75:11.14]Hold on, let me see.
[75:13.82]So right now, we are in, like, full-blown, like, just tendency.
[75:18.75]Like, white tendency, right?
[75:23.27]So that means that, like, things aren't as difficult, but they drop less stuff.
[75:29.07]I think I understand this.
[75:31.07]But, uh, thank you, though.
[75:33.12]Thank you also to Simple Salad for the ten bucks.
[75:35.34]Hi, Jerma.
[75:35.80]I love you.
[75:36.14]Well, thank you.
[75:37.48]I am very much happy with you as well.
[75:41.28]In a very...
[75:43.07]platonic love kind of way.
[75:44.97]Like, you know, I've got that prospect gland shooting into my bloodstream.
[75:50.46]Thank you, Simple Cell.
[75:51.64]Ten bucks.
[75:52.74]Derek, thanks for the one dollar.
[75:54.46]Lord... Lord Jeffrey.
[75:57.58]Lord... Lord Jeffy.
[76:01.00]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[76:01.84]Don't let the others get you down, Jerma.
[76:03.48]You beat the 2-2 boss on your first try.
[76:05.28]That's crazy.
[76:06.34]No, don't worry.
[76:07.22]No one's gonna get me down.
[76:08.76]The only person that gets me down...
[76:11.61]is when somebody gets let go on Chopped that had a great appetizer round, they had a great entree round, but they dropped the ball in the dessert round.
[76:19.50]And then the person next to them, they did a really good job on the entree, but their fucking dessert and their appetizer weren't very good.
[76:25.16]And you're gonna chop somebody from $10,000 because of that?
[76:28.72]The dessert, who cares about dessert?
[76:29.92]It's an after-dinner thing.
[76:30.88]You should care about the entree and care about the appetizer.
[76:33.41]That's the most important thing.
[76:34.37]So if somebody kills it on the dessert round...
[76:36.50]Who cares?
[76:37.78]Like, nobody eats dessert at a restaurant anyways.
[76:39.52]When was the last time you guys went to a restaurant and, like, ordered dessert after you ate?
[76:43.12]Not me.
[76:44.38]That's what fucking gets me, though.
[76:48.49]Thank you.
[76:50.87]Al Bob.
[76:51.91]Al Bob DS.
[76:52.91]Thank you for the two bucks.
[76:53.67]I just subbed, but it didn't let me share, so here's an extra two dollars.
[76:56.37]Love you.
[76:56.79]Smoochies.
[76:59.56]Thank you for the two bucks.
[77:01.86]Much appreciated.
[77:03.46]Thanks a lot, guys.
[77:04.78]And Ragnaros, thank you Ragnaros for the five dollars.
[77:09.70]Barely discovered you like two weeks ago.
[77:11.12]You're probably the best streamer or YouTuber I've ever watched.
[77:13.77]Are you going to play Metal Gear Solid Revengeance?
[77:15.41]Also, hi from France.
[77:16.25]Well, hello.
[77:17.59]Hi from New England, United States.
[77:20.17]Thanks for the five dollars.
[77:22.59]Appreciate the kind words.
[77:24.03]And no, I don't really have any plans to play Metal Gear Solid Revengeance.
[77:31.26]But I do hear it is quite a fun video game.
[77:35.70]There's a hero soul that I didn't get.
[77:42.20]Uh, this place is really dark.
[77:43.26]There's a lot of items that I didn't pick up.
[77:46.63]A chunk of dragon stone.
[77:47.51]Don't I need those?
[77:47.99]I think I need those.
[77:54.23]Is that the one where Raiden has the... The, uh, like the claw from Inspector Gadget Jaw?
[78:02.99]He has, like, the Inspector Gadget bad guy jaw.
[78:05.11]That's the same guy, right?
[78:10.63]Anybody ever have that blood drawn?
[78:12.98]Wait, this is just a boss?
[78:18.62]Uh... Okay.
[78:22.64]Dragon God.
[78:30.09]Uh...
[78:32.75]I didn't expect to be fighting, like, a StarCraft character right now.
[78:36.58]He's gonna punch through the window, isn't he?
[78:38.92]That guy punched the fucking door so hard that it just broke my PlayStation.
[78:43.60]Holy shit.
[78:48.97]Uh, alright.
[78:53.07]That's fucking terrifying.
[79:01.81]Give me the item.
[79:02.33]That's all I care about.
[79:03.07]Come on.
[79:03.53]I gotta... What is it?
[79:06.99]What is this?
[79:07.91]Withdraw weapon.
[79:10.83]What?
[79:12.05]Do I need to use that?
[79:12.77]Is this one of those gimmick fights where I have to smash him with a bone smash?
[79:18.80]I think I'm gonna have to, like, smash him with this.
[79:22.10]He wouldn't make me pick that up.
[79:23.14]It's just like the Storm Ruler from Dark Souls 3.
[79:31.24]Is he grabbing me?
[79:34.03]Where am I?
[79:36.11]Where the fuck am I right now?
[79:38.29]Okay, well that was fun.
[79:39.39]Thanks for the... Thanks for the trip.
[79:42.79]Alright.
[79:53.76]Well, that was dumb.
[80:00.74]Dragonbone Smasher.
[80:03.74]Look at it.
[80:08.04]A bladeless, thick mass of iron used for smashing.
[80:11.54]The ancient excavators of Stonefang are said to have created defaced dragons.
[80:15.33]Ah, okay.
[80:16.79]It is imbued from a spell to... You know, I had blood drawn today.
[80:22.05]Listen, that's why.
[80:23.97]Because of its immense weight, blacksmiths joke that it can scarcely be called a sword.
[80:30.57]So I have to have... This is just a dog bone.
[80:36.82]Yeah, that's right.
[80:37.44]Fear me.
[80:38.92]Fear me and my fucking cartoon dog bone.
[80:46.42]I found this.
[80:47.16]I found this on fucking clip art.
[80:48.58]Yeah, don't worry.
[80:58.60]I'm gonna fucking clip-art this guy, and he's gonna fucking scream, and I lost my... Well, so I'm just gonna hit him once, and he's gonna go... Here we go.
[81:14.38]Dragon Ball.
[81:18.50]This is too slow.
[81:20.28]I'm fat-rolling, too, so that's not good.
[81:22.77]Gah!
[81:37.76]It really does.
[81:38.24]It does look like a Hydralisk from Starcraft.
[81:40.02]That is what I was saying.
[81:43.54]I gotta get rid of the sword.
[81:44.54]The sword's not... Let me take off the other one first.
[81:47.61]Am I still fat rolling with this off?
[81:50.21]Of course I am.
[81:50.85]How heavy is this thing?
[81:55.41]What in the name of God?
[81:56.55]How fucking heavy is this?
[82:00.87]This is 20 points of heaviness.
[82:06.37]Whatever.
[82:11.15]Do I need that thing?
[82:12.11]I mean, I'm already being one-shot with armor on.
[82:16.92]You do have a point.
[82:21.32]And you know, when you have a point, you have a point.
[82:24.50]Alright, let's go.
[82:26.20]Let's bring the cartoon dog bone clipart.com.
[82:34.42]One would say you can destroy dragons with this blade.
[82:38.92]And sometimes that guy makes a joke about how it's hard to use or something, whatever he said.
[82:49.06]Which way am I going?
[82:50.31]Okay, definitely not this way.
[82:53.99]What if I block?
[82:58.21]He can't punch through this, right?
[83:03.00]This thing is so slow, how am I gonna- No, wait a minute.
[83:06.78]Okay, I'm gonna punch my way through.
[83:13.75]Oh, shit.
[83:18.99]I can't- Ayayay.
[83:22.28]It's so slow.
[83:23.36]This is too slow.
[83:25.76]Dragon bone!
[83:26.24]That's not doing anything.
[83:31.89]Can you move your fingers, please?
[83:37.87]What is even hitting me?
[83:38.67]Did I just get crushed by the fucking stupid shit on there?
[83:41.04]Just take the moon grass.
[83:45.06]Wow.
[83:45.72]What even fucking killed me?
[83:47.34]What is... Alright, okay.
[83:51.79]I'm taking off this dumb thing.
[83:53.15]Putting my armor back on.
[83:55.94]That guy just scared me and I died.
[83:58.24]Take this stupid shit off.
[84:02.04]Give me my claymore back.
[84:03.72]Put my armor back on.
[84:04.86]Okay, let's go.
[84:12.79]I just wasted a late moongrass for no reason.
[84:16.35]Just don't even eat anything.
[84:21.27]So I just have to dodge and just run around.
[84:24.35]That's what I have to do.
[84:31.90]You can hear him screaming.
[84:32.72]Go ahead.
[84:33.06]You can scream.
[84:34.46]You can yell.
[84:35.11]That's fine.
[84:37.61]Let me just get through here.
[84:38.85]Here we go.
[84:39.39]And we're gonna... The thing that I don't like about this boss the most is the fact that he punches through the script.
[84:47.65]I mean, it's like... You can't really tell what's even going on.
[84:51.39]It's hard.
[84:51.73]I need to be able to watch his hand.
[84:56.18]God fucking damn it.
[85:03.97]Oh my lord.
[85:13.70]So here's a funny story guys.
[85:15.52]I've died the most on this boss.
[85:18.59]This is just a guy you have to run around and he just like instant punches kills you in the ground.
[85:28.17]I'm glad that I'm fighting this guy.
[85:29.71]I haven't even fought him yet.
[85:31.33]I just have to avoid him.
[85:33.53]And I've died more on this guy than anyone else in the whole game.
[85:36.22]Alright, go ahead and skip my CD.
[85:42.92]Are you fucking serious?
[85:52.07]He hit me from behind!
[85:53.51]Fucking god, dude.
[86:02.44]Alright, so I'm just gonna watch him and see what he does.
[86:10.62]Because it seems like I have to just watch his hands come down.
[86:19.99]I have to stealth this.
[86:21.51]Okay, just tell me this.
[86:23.03]Is this guy a gimmick boss?
[86:26.12]Do I have to just avoid his fucking Nintendo Power Glove?
[86:30.32]And make it, like, jump on his head?
[86:32.13]Okay, what do you do?
[86:40.91]I'm gonna see what you do here.
[86:42.85]Is it gonna punch?
[86:47.13]Wait, wait.
[86:53.80]See?
[87:01.94]So he puts both of his hands down.
[87:12.36]I love how somebody just went, see?
[87:21.35]Standing still the whole time.
[87:22.27]I'm trying to see what he does and what his hands are doing.
[87:26.85]By the way, thank God that this is right here.
[87:31.94]You don't get punched in the face.
[87:32.78]Well, even if I dodge that, it still hits me.
[87:41.61]Okay, see?
[87:42.07]Like, okay, his hands are right there.
[87:45.88]Where are his hands going now?
[87:46.82]Where are your hands going?
[87:50.92]Okay, are both of his hands down?
[87:52.32]I can't even fucking tell.
[87:59.45]I got punched in the face in real life.
[88:02.41]Like I was leaning in and that punched me in the face.
[88:05.47]I like to... I just don't get it.
[88:17.23]I think apparently I just have to dodge.
[88:29.50]The future is now.
[88:33.30]Do I just have to hide to fight this guy?
[88:39.17]This better not be a situation where I have to stand behind a fucking pole.
[88:52.95]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[88:57.32]It is, isn't it?
[88:59.28]It is, isn't it?
[89:00.98]Watch, he's gonna turn around or something.
[89:05.28]Yep.
[89:07.38]Mm-hmm.
[89:08.08]I just have to, like, stealth this.
[89:12.87]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[89:15.13]No.
[89:15.61]That is what you have to do, isn't it?
[89:17.03]I'm so angry.
[89:20.20]He heard that.
[89:29.95]He smells the smog.
[89:33.21]I know you're here somewhere, Hobbit.
[89:37.42]I can smell you, the delicious flesh.
[89:46.44]There's another thing to break.
[89:47.38]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[89:59.18]His hands on top of me.
[90:00.74]If this guy like picks his ass.
[90:12.56]I fucking hate this.
[90:13.34]I just want to fight him.
[90:15.46]I can't do this shit.
[90:16.76]I'm too anxious.
[90:18.22]Here he goes.
[90:18.54]He's looking that way.
[90:19.68]No, I'm going to wait until his head cocks to the side like a fucking baby bird.
[90:31.05]Can I crouch?
[90:32.13]What is this?
[90:33.13]What is this thing?
[90:36.16]What am I doing?
[90:40.96]This is the gimmick?
[90:43.50]This is not going to kill him, is it?
[90:50.47]That's going to make him really angry, right?
[91:00.89]Uh, he just made a way down.
[91:04.82]Oh, fuck.
[91:08.54]It is a fucking gimmick, boss.
[91:12.40]He's, like, locked down there, right?
[91:13.79]Is he, like, stuck down there?
[91:15.43]We gotta go.
[91:17.87]Is he gonna be able to see me?
[91:23.93]He can see me, right?
[91:24.79]No, not yet.
[91:28.08]There's gonna be another one.
[91:28.94]Oh, fuck.
[91:29.69]God, come on.
[91:32.67]Is it just like in other games where if you, like, do that, you won't get hit?
[91:34.95]I heard that, but I don't think he knows where I am.
[91:43.40]Ah!
[91:45.34]Ah!
[91:46.64]Take the shield!
[91:47.12]I'm just block!
[91:48.50]Uh-oh.
[91:56.16]Look the other way.
[91:56.96]Come on.
[91:58.10]I've seen Ghostbusters.
[91:59.18]I know how to beat you.
[91:59.96]Give me a fucking reference.
[92:03.62]Look the other way.
[92:04.50]All the way.
[92:14.44]Oh, God.
[92:14.95]I don't know if you can... You can't see me, right?
[92:18.61]Okay, good.
[92:19.45]There it is.
[92:19.75]There's the yellow wall.
[92:25.41]Oh, you fucking idiot!
[92:26.65]You stupid boy!
[92:28.85]Stupid boy!
[92:34.49]Oh, you!
[92:34.97]Come on, what the fuck?
[92:37.41]No, wait, wait, don't look at me.
[92:41.01]Why is this taking extra hits?
[93:02.53]Don't do it, please!
[93:06.97]I needed to hit it more than... No!
[93:09.91]I had to hit it more than once.
[93:12.10]Oh my god.
[93:13.62]Why?
[93:14.66]Why?
[93:15.98]Why?
[93:16.32]I had to fucking two-hand the damn thing.
[93:18.92]Oh my god, I bounced off of it.
[93:21.12]Like I got in a fucking...
[93:29.46]Oh, that is so stupid.
[93:32.44]I need to hit it twice.
[93:36.24]Where the hell was I supposed to even go?
[93:39.59]And now I know what his gimmick is.
[93:42.43]Let's go.
[93:42.91]Go ahead.
[93:43.71]Go ahead and throw a punch.
[93:45.25]Wait.
[93:45.65]I need to wait.
[93:46.13]I need to wait.
[93:47.95]Just fucking do it.
[93:49.11]No.
[93:49.67]Come on, you stupid fucking boy.
[93:53.19]Oh, God.
[93:53.71]Just go.
[93:54.33]Please get me through this.
[93:57.16]Unbelievable.
[93:58.86]Un-fucking-believable.
[93:59.70]You know what I mean?
[94:02.16]You can't see me.
[94:02.98]Stop that.
[94:04.66]Just hurry up.
[94:08.98]Go.
[94:09.26]Go.
[94:10.20]Go.
[94:10.52]Get behind the wall.
[94:11.76]Get behind it.
[94:18.44]Can't be taking this long.
[94:24.62]Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him.
[94:29.12]Come on.
[94:30.68]We've already seen this cutscene.
[94:31.86]There he goes.
[94:32.26]He's down.
[94:32.66]Is there a skip right here?
[94:36.15]There is.
[94:38.65]Wow.
[94:42.29]I would have been so scared and so angry.
[94:43.91]Okay, we're back here.
[94:44.85]We're good.
[94:52.28]It's a fucking gimmick.
[94:56.93]You have to have a gimmick right now.
[95:03.27]Did he see me?
[95:05.81]Wait, what?
[95:06.83]No he doesn't, right?
[95:10.96]What?
[95:11.12]Did he see me?
[95:11.58]I love how I'm playing red light green light with this fucking dragon.
[95:21.42]That was red light and I almost got caught.
[95:23.42]I almost got sent out of the class.
[95:30.50]Alright, this is where I was last time.
[95:31.74]Don't fuck it up.
[95:35.92]Green means go.
[95:36.94]I can't even see his eyes.
[95:37.72]Where is he?
[95:39.54]When he throws his head in the air.
[95:41.68]That means it's time to go.
[95:45.78]Go on.
[95:46.88]Do it.
[95:48.90]Do it.
[95:49.70]Throw your head up.
[95:53.68]Nice fucking camera angle.
[95:55.70]Nice camera angle.
[95:57.60]Nice camera angle.
[96:00.87]Stupid camera.
[96:04.13]Wait, wait.
[96:05.69]Hey, hey, hey.
[96:06.65]Slow down there, guy.
[96:08.05]Slow down there, friend of mine.
[96:10.78]Not a big deal.
[96:12.20]It's okay.
[96:13.10]It just hurts a little bit.
[96:21.82]Can he see me through this?
[96:26.49]I think... I don't know.
[96:27.13]Can he see me through that rock?
[96:29.77]I don't... I think he can.
[96:34.28]Can you see me through the rock?
[96:50.92]Eat it!
[96:51.22]Eat my ass!
[96:53.16]That's not gonna save me!
[96:53.92]That's too small!
[96:56.08]That's okay.
[97:00.98]There's a bug there.
[97:02.64]No, I don't care about the bug.
[97:04.07]We've got to get rid of this guy.
[97:05.01]Goodbye.
[97:05.29]Maybe he's like a T-Rex?
[97:18.15]I know I missed a bug.
[97:19.35]You want me to miss that bug and have to do this all over again?
[97:21.31]No way.
[97:27.01]Where is he?
[97:28.37]Wait, I gotta put the dragon thing on, right?
[97:30.05]Where's his head?
[97:31.31]He's right there.
[97:33.13]Give me the dragon bone.
[97:39.23]Get down there, come on.
[97:42.36]With my luck, he's gonna get up, isn't he?
[97:44.32]Just with my luck, he'll stand up.
[97:47.30]Get off the screen.
[97:49.54]Huh?
[97:50.68]What am I supposed to do?
[97:51.36]Oh, it's okay, it's right there.
[97:52.10]Alright, right in the head.
[97:55.56]Kill him.
[97:56.64]Wait a minute, he's gonna breathe fire!
[97:58.01]Just spit everywhere.
[98:01.17]Alright, die!
[98:01.83]I got it.
[98:03.87]Okay.
[98:05.35]Whoo-hoo.
[98:12.12]Oh, if he, like, breathes fire on me, I would have been so angry.
[98:15.20]27,000 souls.
[98:20.38]Holy shit.
[98:24.93]I can't carry the dragon demon soul.
[98:40.40]Huh?
[98:40.68]I don't have it.
[98:42.58]Okay, thank god.
[98:43.16]I was gonna say, what?
[98:47.95]Oh, I have too much equipment.
[98:55.37]You tell me I can't carry this fucking thing?
[98:58.02]Fuck.
[99:02.10]What do I have that I can't... I'm not gonna pee a lot, by the way.
[99:06.02]Put on the burden ring.
[99:13.89]Oh yeah, that's right.
[99:14.67]I forgot.
[99:15.35]I thought I had it on, but I took it off to do the cling ring.
[99:17.83]There we go.
[99:23.78]Pure Dragonstone.
[99:27.23]Wait.
[99:29.67]Is that the thing that I got?
[99:31.42]Is that the thing I'm supposed to get?
[99:35.18]Rare pure Dragonstone.
[99:38.16]Enhances straight swords, axes, hammers, and so on.
[99:42.08]Fire.
[99:45.42]Oh, I already got the soul.
[99:46.32]Okay.
[99:47.92]Alright, let me take a look.
[99:48.62]Is there, um... Anything else here I can take or do?
[99:54.24]Okay, I see an item right there.
[99:55.48]Good thing I have a smart man's brain.
[99:57.81]And I, you know, went to smart man school.
[100:02.69]So I could get this smart thing.
[100:06.64]Legendary!
[100:07.36]Sold.
[100:10.32]Only for straight swords?
[100:11.50]Aww.
[100:13.04]That's not cool.
[100:20.52]Anything else that I missed in my, like, fucking panic?
[100:22.48]Because I was absolutely panicking.
[100:24.15]Make sure I didn't miss, like, an item up here.
[100:27.77]I probably didn't.
[100:29.89]No, let's just go.
[100:30.89]I got a lot of souls to crush and eat.
[100:37.07]I'm gonna buy 99 half-moon grass, by the way.
[100:39.38]Keeping my brain back.
[100:44.98]Yeah, I could use it.
[100:49.88]Alright.
[100:51.90]Let's go.
[100:55.97]Nothing else.
[100:56.81]Back to the Nexus.
[100:57.55]So is this it?
[100:59.45]Is that it for World 2?
[101:00.39]I'm assuming that there's one of those in every world?
[101:09.98]Let's crush some of this stuff that I have.
[101:16.12]Dragon Demon Soul, Lead Demon Soul, Legendary Soldier's Soul.
[101:19.19]We're going to use this.
[101:20.07]That's a lot.
[101:22.77]Holy shit.
[101:23.65]Nice.
[101:26.01]Storied Hero Soul.
[101:30.23]12,000.
[101:31.98]Okay.
[101:32.50]Dragon Demon Soul.
[101:35.16]What do you get for a Dragon Demon Soul?
[101:38.04]That's a good question.
[101:41.22]We're going to look it up on Googlepedia.
[101:49.69]It's a bunch of... That's 27,000 souls.
[101:56.26]We're crushing this.
[101:59.28]Fireball, Firestorm, or God's Wrath.
[102:01.44]These are all fucking spells.
[102:02.92]I'm not a spell person.
[102:08.80]This is a ton of... We're just breaking this thing.
[102:12.33]This is not cheating.
[102:13.77]I don't know how many times we have to say this.
[102:18.27]You get the best spell in the game.
[102:21.22]Yeah, but... I'm not doing any magic at all in this run.
[102:27.68]Everything I've heard about Demon's Souls is magic makes this game, like, brokenly easy, right?
[102:34.59]That's from what everything I've... Everything people have told me, all the things that we've talked about, all the things that I've, like, heard about this game, is that if you do, like, pure magic in Demon's Souls, you, like, can't lose the game.
[102:46.91]Is that true?
[102:47.23]Is that true?
[102:52.56]I'm fairly certain that's what it is.
[102:55.38]What are my thoughts on flapjacks?
[103:01.31]They're delicious.
[103:02.83]You can literally one-shot bosses with Firestorm.
[103:05.51]I want to play this game like Melee.
[103:09.47]Makes it a lot harder, but I want to play it like that.
[103:13.95]What I'm saying is goodbye.
[103:15.31]It's gone.
[103:22.66]Yeah, no cheese.
[103:23.78]I don't want to do any cheese.
[103:25.06]I want to play the game as FromSoftware intended.
[103:29.97]And I have 65,000 souls.
[103:31.47]So let's go buy, like, five... Let's go buy 6,500 green grass.
[103:41.85]Let's think about this here.
[103:43.91]Where'd she go?
[103:46.63]Where did you go?
[103:47.23]Oh.
[103:51.12]I do seek power.
[103:52.14]So seeks all power.
[103:54.36]So one question that I do have for some of you guys that have played through this game a bunch.
[103:57.34]What are the soft caps in Demon's Soul?
[104:04.04]Is it like 40 strength?
[104:05.66]Is it like 25 endurance?
[104:08.46]25 vitality?
[104:09.12]What are the soft caps in the game?
[104:10.88]40?
[104:12.72]So should I get strength to 40 and endurance to like 35?
[104:16.54]30?
[104:16.84]Is it the same thing like in the other games?
[104:24.71]It was 40 in all the games.
[104:26.55]Yeah, I just didn't know if it was... Because this is their first game like this.
[104:32.01]We'll put some in Vitality.
[104:35.59]Let's get Vitality to 24.
[104:37.97]And then let's put the Rest and Strength.
[104:46.45]That was three.
[104:47.83]Yeah.
[104:48.23]Endurance.
[104:49.35]I'm okay with having Endurance at like 22 to 23 or 24.
[104:54.29]Let's keep going with strength.
[104:55.51]Let's get it to 40.
[104:59.86]I'm gonna be fucking killing people now.
[105:05.30]Yes, so that was a lot of stuff.
[105:08.08]Do faith.
[105:09.02]Ah, no, I'm not doing no cleaver.
[105:11.15]No cleaver.
[105:14.09]It's too much.
[105:14.63]I need to put too many points into faith.
[105:22.54]I just do.
[105:24.96]That's points that could go into, like, endurance and shit.
[105:27.26]Like, and the meat cleaver is, like, a cool weapon, but... I'm not, uh... I'm not going to do it.
[105:33.12]I'm sorry.
[105:38.01]Let's put some of this stuff away.
[105:43.07]Mmm... I think I need... two more of these.
[105:49.44]Use the bone smasher?
[105:55.22]I could actually check it out.
[105:56.62]Just take a look at it.
[105:57.24]Just put this shit in the bank.
[106:03.94]Shard of Suckerstone.
[106:09.72]The Dragonbone Smasher is not a gimmick weapon.
[106:11.62]It's the best strength weapon in the game that I was lucky enough to get.
[106:15.86]Well, okay.
[106:19.44]Let's give it a look.
[106:24.19]There's the Bonesmasher, Claymore, Morningstar, like a bunch of great clubs.
[106:31.84]What do I have this shit for?
[106:36.84]Oh no, wait, is it you guys doing like a coffee pasta now?
[106:41.86]Alright, I'm okay with that.
[106:44.64]I'm gonna deposit like 40 of these.
[106:53.27]Because they're kind of just taking up space.
[106:55.87]Let me examine the bone.
[106:57.35]Can the bone smasher be upgraded?
[107:01.79]200 plus 168.
[107:02.87]And I need 30 strength to use it.
[107:04.87]And it's a B in scaling.
[107:07.63]Can it be upgraded?
[107:14.02]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[107:21.18]That's... That thing's awesome.
[107:28.11]Holy shit.
[107:35.42]I think we're gonna be a dog bone streamer.
[107:40.18]It's so heavy though.
[107:44.87]It's so slow and so heavy.
[107:46.67]You think I'm gonna be able to do this?
[107:47.79]I need like a lot of endurance then, because look at one swing.
[107:52.95]One swing is enough for me to do one swing and a dodge.
[107:57.76]We'll try it for a little bit.
[107:59.74]I do want to go look at one thing.
[108:00.72]I have to pee.
[108:01.72]Bad.
[108:03.81]So give me one sec.
[108:04.63]I was going to pee.
[108:06.31]See you guys in like two minutes.
[108:08.41]Be right back.
[112:09.25]Okay.
[112:12.83]Let's get back to it.
[112:18.47]That feels better.
[112:21.16]That feels much better.
[112:24.10]Let me buy a couple of gray ass from this dude.
[112:27.68]Wow, we've been long...
[112:33.84]Okay.
[112:35.50]One, three.
[112:37.28]One, three.
[112:37.92]Let's see.
[112:38.26]We got, it's two, four.
[112:40.53]This one's done.
[112:43.17]One, three.
[112:43.89]Let's give one, three to go.
[112:51.37]Patch is the grass dealer.
[112:52.51]That's kind of who he is, right?
[113:01.18]Just drinking a little bit of a drinky drink.
[113:04.59]Tied me over.
[113:05.29]One... Oh, okay.
[113:11.75]There it is.
[113:17.55]Just one cold one.
[113:18.55]It's not a big deal.
[113:19.37]It's not even... It's not even a real drink.
[113:25.07]Wait.
[113:25.93]I remember this guy.
[113:31.90]Bows...
[113:33.82]Is this a PvP player?
[113:35.98]You're doing the emote that everybody does.
[113:37.52]Hey!
[113:39.29]Alright.
[113:50.89]Let's see if I like the dragon bone.
[113:58.13]This is kind of like Undead Burg.
[114:01.84]Alright.
[114:02.50]What is the one hand like this?
[114:03.66]Not bad.
[114:06.46]Alright, well.
[114:08.44]Good to know.
[114:12.81]We got a carriage with a bunch of dogs that absolutely is going to open, so might as well just take care of that immediately.
[114:17.79]Uh, nope.
[114:20.45]And I'm fat rolling.
[114:21.41]Didn't even know that.
[114:22.81]Didn't know that one, guys.
[114:26.94]Gonna have to fucking take care of that.
[114:30.04]I can't even swing the sword, and I'm about to lose... Everything.
[114:33.78]Uh, without e- you know, just turn and run because I did- I- I'm fat rolling.
[114:42.90]I did not know that, I don't know how I didn't fucking know that.
[114:47.92]So all my- all my health is gone now, and that's- that's fucking great.
[114:50.97]That's- that's just fantastic.
[114:55.77]Fucking fat roll, man.
[114:56.93]Seriously.
[114:57.25]I'm gonna put like... I'm gonna put like 50 points into Endurance.
[115:03.69]Give me a fucking break.
[115:05.68]Oh my god.
[115:06.68]What a fucking joke.
[115:09.06]What do I have for weight right now?
[115:12.32]36 out of 50.
[115:12.98]No.
[115:18.83]I'm just saying.
[115:20.09]What do I have to be at?
[115:21.31]Minus less than 50%, right?
[115:21.87]Okay.
[115:29.16]I'm not even sure I'm gonna be there here, right?
[115:31.47]Like, I have to have no clothes on.
[115:37.29]Maybe no shield?
[115:42.47]25?
[115:43.81]No.
[115:44.67]Uh, dragon bone ain't going on right now, guys.
[115:48.56]Unless I wanna just do no armor.
[115:53.46]Like, I could do, like, nude.
[115:57.03]I'm not even sure, can I have the shield?
[115:58.67]I can do nude and shield.
[116:02.27]Apparently.
[116:09.98]And I want... The other one too.
[116:23.30]Okay, let's try this again.
[116:27.38]At least put some pants on.
[116:28.42]I have pants on.
[116:30.36]They have boxers.
[116:33.79]Got my zero souls.
[116:34.85]Good thing I spent all that already.
[116:36.05]Alright, so here come the dogs.
[116:38.31]I gotta, like, time this like a baseball swing.
[116:40.71]There he comes.
[116:41.63]Alright.
[116:44.76]That's not what I wanted to do.
[116:47.64]I'm sorry.
[116:47.92]I pressed up while I was hitting R1.
[116:49.20]That's just so much damage, though.
[116:52.36]Jesus.
[116:52.62]Jesus.
[116:54.61]That is truly insane.
[116:56.15]That's like four times as much as I was doing before.
[117:03.47]You're gonna hear me talk shit again.
[117:06.98]There's nothing I hate more in these games than that forward.
[117:09.38]If you're holding forward and fucking pressing R1.
[117:11.14]There's nothing in these games that I hate more.
[117:16.46]That shit.
[117:18.68]Just get it out of here.
[117:20.14]And I know I'm gonna heal, but I have so many of these that don't even matter.
[117:27.50]They're gonna all break out.
[117:28.42]I know it.
[117:29.26]I'm not that dumb.
[117:31.32]Why can I not kill you while you're in there?
[117:34.66]Of course not.
[117:35.29]Alright, well here they come.
[117:36.11]I'm gonna get like five dogs on me.
[117:41.13]A lot of souls though.
[117:42.01]I'm okay with that.
[117:44.61]Any second.
[117:45.05]Come on.
[117:48.67]That's like 50,000 souls right there.
[117:51.03]Could go back and level up again if I wanted to.
[117:54.91]When are you guys gonna break out?
[117:56.03]I know it's gonna happen.
[117:58.01]I'm certain it's gonna happen.
[118:00.50]Why would they put that there if it wasn't gonna happen?
[118:02.78]Did I miss an item?
[118:11.37]It's like a little, alright, secret entrance.
[118:13.33]This is locked.
[118:16.91]It's probably some kind of skip, I would assume.
[118:21.36]It looks cool.
[118:21.96]Well, whatever.
[118:22.44]I mean, it does look cool.
[118:25.27]I will say.
[118:25.65]So I'm going to roll down this.
[118:31.61]This is too perfect, but I knew it.
[118:33.21]I'm not going to throw the whole wagon down here.
[118:41.56]Oh, boy.
[118:42.14]That's a loading screen.
[118:44.82]Where's the lizard?
[118:45.42]I hear it.
[118:48.08]What?
[118:51.77]Why do I care about this guy?
[118:59.54]Alright, I gotta get the... Where's the bug?
[119:07.48]Over here.
[119:11.66]One hit.
[119:12.26]That works for me.
[119:12.96]Chunk of Hearthstone.
[119:13.66]I think I can now upgrade the Claymore.
[119:16.18]But am I going to?
[119:17.38]I'm not sure.
[119:22.93]I mean, this thing is disgusting.
[119:25.17]But is it worth using the rest of the game?
[119:27.41]I don't know.
[119:27.83]I can't even wear clothes.
[119:36.16]I have to be one of those guys that uses the giant weapon without any clothes on.
[119:39.28]Oh, illusions?
[119:45.28]Nope.
[119:47.90]I can go that way.
[119:48.68]Nothing up here.
[119:52.46]There's an item.
[119:56.06]Stone... You know what?
[119:57.64]I might just take one.
[120:02.27]How many do I have?
[120:02.89]I have a lot, don't I?
[120:06.09]I have 19 of these.
[120:08.39]Alright, so... If I use one of these, let me just make sure, because there's all kinds of weird, fucked up shit in these games.
[120:16.66]Is there a reason to hold on to these?
[120:19.36]Like, can I give them to somebody, or is it just... It's just humanity.
[120:23.57]Is this just humanity?
[120:27.83]Because if it's humanity, I'll take one.
[120:35.53]So, okay.
[120:36.21]If I die in human form, it makes the game harder.
[120:39.27]Okay.
[120:43.17]So I'm just going to take one.
[120:48.04]Gain my body.
[120:51.27]So just try not to die while you're in this, otherwise it'll bring the world tendency down and make the game much harder.
[121:03.08]Is that why it just got darker?
[121:07.38]I might be losing my mind.
[121:08.24]Am I going crazy?
[121:10.36]Wait, up here.
[121:12.16]Can't go that way.
[121:16.77]Alright.
[121:18.69]Through the door.
[121:22.95]Didn't hit him.
[121:28.04]I gotta get used to this thing.
[121:31.42]This is... I gotta queue up attacks so early.
[121:33.32]This is so slow.
[121:36.29]It's kind of making me anxious.
[121:39.23]Because during boss fights, this is... This is not the boss fight weapon.
[121:42.45]That's for sure.
[121:49.32]There's like stuff down there.
[121:50.54]Let me just look here first before I do any jumping down into hell Yeah, hello, hi you want to come up here?
[122:07.29]Why you sound like weird and different?
[122:10.91]Did you know I got the fucking bone crush?
[122:22.73]Hold on.
[122:23.01]Wait a minute.
[122:26.31]This whole time... Oh, it is.
[122:30.19]It is a fat guy.
[122:31.05]Okay.
[122:31.45]I was going to say the whole time I thought this was a fat guy with a handkerchief around his neck.
[122:35.38]It is.
[122:36.98]That is what this is.
[122:39.26]Good.
[122:39.52]I'm making sure I'm not crazy.
[122:46.94]More up.
[122:48.20]Ow.
[122:55.30]Ow.
[122:58.00]Still need to get that item that was over there.
[122:59.44]This is an illusion for sure, right?
[123:05.70]There's no way this wouldn't be an illusion.
[123:09.58]It's not.
[123:12.23]Really?
[123:12.65]This is not an illusion?
[123:13.77]That has to be.
[123:16.39]They forgot to program this one in.
[123:18.26]This was gonna be one.
[123:21.06]Right.
[123:22.54]Let's be real.
[123:23.60]That was going to be an illusionary wall.
[123:32.29]Uh... Wait, let me take off this ring.
[123:33.77]Okay.
[123:37.83]I need bombs.
[123:41.35]I have this Kling ring on I don't need.
[123:44.01]So what should I put on instead?
[123:48.57]Max item burden, fire resist, bleeding, lowest magic defensive top power.
[123:54.94]I guess I'll just go with the item burden for now.
[124:04.28]I don't think, unless there's like a poison or something like that in this level that I don't know about.
[124:08.35]I need to go back up there and fall down so I can get the item.
[124:19.80]Ah, where were you?
[124:20.42]Over here?
[124:28.78]Full moon grass.
[124:31.04]Always a pleasure.
[124:33.46]I think that's good.
[124:34.64]I just have to jump from here to there.
[124:36.90]Don't die from this.
[124:39.02]The fall damage in Demon's Souls is very odd, because it's either you're going to take, like, a smidge of health, or it's going to kill you.
[124:45.21]There's no in-between, it seems.
[124:57.37]Alright.
[124:59.30]Go backwards to make sure we didn't get any disastrous left-behind items.
[125:05.24]What's this?
[125:06.28]No.
[125:06.88]Oh.
[125:08.72]I already was here.
[125:10.02]I'm, like, going backwards.
[125:11.78]Oh, well.
[125:12.74]Oopsie.
[125:18.60]I still don't have the thief's ring.
[125:19.86]No, I do not have the... I do not have the thief ring.
[125:22.08]You're right.
[125:22.66]I don't have it yet.
[125:23.22]Oh.
[125:29.05]I feel like that's death if you go down.
[125:30.23]There comes another boulder.
[125:36.14]Drop it!
[125:41.70]I've played too many of these games to, you know, I know when something like that's gonna happen at this point, you know?
[125:55.37]Or do I?
[125:56.89]Maybe not.
[126:01.04]Can you backstab with this?
[126:04.48]552 backstab damage.
[126:05.26]Holy shit.
[126:17.29]A lot of new moon grass.
[126:20.72]Delusion.
[126:25.38]No, it's not.
[126:26.60]There's like a little corner here.
[126:28.16]Ah, dammit.
[126:29.76]I guess that's a hide from the boulder area.
[126:32.62]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[126:33.60]We also have nothing over here.
[126:41.30]Hey!
[126:42.58]What?
[126:46.41]Jesus Christ.
[126:51.25]Alright, that was a reaction like somebody just stole my wallet out of my hands in downtown.
[126:57.91]A guy just ran by me sprinting and grabbed my purse.
[127:09.20]I hear a guy.
[127:09.78]He just came behind me.
[127:10.56]I was gonna say, I don't think I can swing this in here, but I can.
[127:20.34]You're fine.
[127:20.70]We're good.
[127:21.34]Illusion.
[127:27.89]I'm gonna get another cutscene.
[127:28.83]This is just the cutscene area.
[127:34.82]No, we're not gonna get a jokey cutscene where the guy laughs.
[127:40.74]Oh, dear me.
[127:41.74]Dearie me.
[127:43.31]Why don't you come back here so I don't get hit by arrows the whole time I fight you?
[127:46.25]That would be nice.
[127:46.83]And I'm gonna bury this in his head.
[127:51.79]This is why you use Bone Dragon.
[127:53.27]In situations like this.
[128:01.67]See?
[128:02.31]That's what I'm talking about.
[128:03.21]Don't fuck with a naked guy with a cartoon bone.
[128:17.30]Just get in here.
[128:19.12]Just fucking kill him.
[128:26.66]If I had magic, that guy would be dead.
[128:31.00]I knew you were in here.
[128:31.86]I just didn't know where.
[128:34.06]Oh, shit!
[128:35.08]What's happening to my character?
[128:36.14]Where am I getting shot from?
[128:37.52]I'm panicking.
[128:38.02]What happened?
[128:39.58]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[128:40.90]What hit me?
[128:44.22]I got ping-ponged.
[128:52.06]Fuck it.
[128:52.36]I mean, I'm... I panicked eight, but... Use the green.
[128:56.69]Don't use the other one.
[128:57.43]I just was fucking panicking.
[128:58.55]There's nothing even in here.
[128:59.37]Oh, there's a door.
[129:06.96]That was an emergency.
[129:07.94]If you don't think that's true, like, come on.
[129:09.52]That was an emergency.
[129:11.16]Nothing else out here?
[129:13.02]Know the ways to go?
[129:14.24]I like to explore and know that I'm doing a full 100... Look, see?
[129:17.88]This is why you 100%.
[129:20.66]Because of situations like this.
[129:22.70]I knew there was a... There's a lot of dudes over there.
[129:27.48]This is why you... This is why you explore.
[129:28.92]Because it might be like a fog gate to go in.
[129:30.54]Yep.
[129:40.83]You got the fancy armor.
[129:41.77]That's fine.
[129:42.53]Come on over here.
[129:43.11]That guy... That guy could have been an NPC and it doesn't even matter.
[129:51.80]This weapon is fucking ridiculous, man.
[129:58.38]Why fight people when you can just, at range, drop a piano on their head?
[130:11.86]They don't even get into, I'm gonna fight you, range, before you kill me.
[130:17.77]I gotta be careful here.
[130:21.28]All these dickheads.
[130:23.46]Alright, we're going for something crazy right now.
[130:26.26]Check this one out.
[130:30.36]Told you it was crazy!
[130:31.26]Told you it was crazy!
[130:37.91]Emergency!
[130:52.44]Okay, good.
[130:52.78]He didn't have an item.
[130:55.14]Iron ring of keys.
[130:57.04]That door in the beginning I can probably open now.
[130:59.10]But where is it?
[131:04.03]It's down... I think it's down there, isn't it?
[131:06.49]Okay, the door that's down there.
[131:09.17]This is a stupid idea, but if it's like a skip or something, I need to get it.
[131:13.17]What the hell was it?
[131:17.73]Iron ring of keys.
[131:19.40]An iron ring of keys.
[131:20.16]They all look the same.
[131:20.90]Alright.
[131:21.21]I'll go open the dog crate.
[131:26.67]Don't jump down.
[131:28.17]I don't plan on it.
[131:31.79]Go down here.
[131:32.31]Let's get this.
[131:36.96]Storied hero soul.
[131:41.52]What else?
[131:45.17]That's how you get that item.
[131:46.09]Now I have to jump down.
[131:48.57]Right?
[131:49.33]There's no other way for me to go.
[131:50.23]Oh my god.
[131:54.31]Why does that... Why does it, like, automatically does that shit?
[131:58.31]That's fucking terrifying.
[132:10.34]Oh, wow.
[132:11.38]Come on.
[132:17.19]Shit Shit I was convinced convinced that was gonna be the thing Well nobody's alive so I can just go back oh
[132:45.30]It's back in the other area.
[132:46.34]Oh, well.
[132:46.74]Uh... It wasn't for this door, was it?
[132:54.94]Nope.
[132:55.26]They're still there.
[132:59.28]It's back before the boss.
[133:00.66]Oh, well.
[133:01.17]Well... Well, let's just run through again and go back the way we were going.
[133:06.49]Uh... Which way was it?
[133:11.17]Uh...
[133:18.02]Did I go down this?
[133:22.88]Go back and unlock the tower and eye door.
[133:24.28]Don't worry, I won't forget.
[133:25.66]I absolutely will, so don't hold me to that.
[133:31.20]I'm going to forget about everything that I just said.
[133:33.08]Okay, back up here.
[133:41.86]There was one way to go that way.
[133:43.76]I went in this one already.
[133:45.33]It's a bunch of shit in here.
[133:46.67]And I remember being like, oh, there's a way to go.
[133:49.17]What the fuck?
[133:50.13]Whoa!
[133:52.83]Let me go the other way.
[133:53.45]Looks like I could go up.
[134:00.44]I went through the fog gate.
[134:03.68]Shit.
[134:04.86]Let me go up over here.
[134:07.26]Put a shoe on my head or it's pre-recorded.
[134:24.80]I win.
[134:25.08]I don't think I've ever fucking heard that one before.
[134:29.36]I have like at least five shoes near me at all times.
[134:39.97]Whoa.
[134:44.79]Hi.
[134:46.11]That comment was pre-recorded.
[134:55.68]Ooh.
[134:58.38]Long sword, short spear.
[135:02.95]If I can make that spear.
[135:08.19]Plate.
[135:10.64]Should I buy a ton of turpentine?
[135:26.66]hmm broadsword I have to claim more broadsword night sword what is this thing night shield knight sword this is kind of cool looking we're all pre-recorded
[135:52.81]Um... I mean... I could get a ton of turpentine.
[136:01.67]Night sword is the best regular sword in the game.
[136:03.51]It's not the bone smasher.
[136:05.45]I mean, we're kind of committing to heavy weapons at this point.
[136:10.26]So, I'm going to buy $9,000 worth of turpentine.
[136:13.94]Because, you know, it just does more damage.
[136:16.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[136:18.00]I don't think I can put this on the bone man.
[136:20.58]The bone sword.
[136:27.85]I can't put this on the sword, can I?
[136:29.37]Because it's not a sword.
[136:30.17]It's a blunt object.
[136:32.86]Can I do that?
[136:38.24]The bone man?
[136:39.10]I don't know.
[136:39.52]Bone sword?
[136:40.42]Bone guy?
[136:41.06]Bone thing?
[136:43.52]Test it.
[136:45.60]I think I already have one.
[136:48.12]I want to test this.
[136:51.93]Because I ain't going to get fucked up from this shit.
[136:56.55]Why don't I say more swear words?
[137:00.49]Okay, I can.
[137:01.51]Yeah, I can.
[137:04.39]Uh... Regardless if this is a bad idea or not, I just did it.
[137:12.20]So... I just did it.
[137:14.04]I just bought... I have 22 turpentine now.
[137:18.04]So I'm good to go.
[137:21.41]If that was a bad idea, then I'm full of bad ideas.
[137:24.85]Who cares?
[137:29.88]I have 22 chances to make a name for myself.
[137:35.30]Great sword.
[137:37.63]Nice.
[137:39.29]There's a lot of weapons to look at.
[137:41.23]None of them are the bone.
[137:44.11]Although, I'm done up here, though.
[137:48.15]I am done up there.
[137:49.55]Let's go through the fog gate.
[137:57.85]Don't use too much turpentine.
[137:58.87]Your character will explode.
[138:00.07]That's a pretty good sword.
[138:04.64]We'll check it out when we go back to town.
[138:05.76]Alright, this is where I ended up.
[138:10.28]Got a little bit more to scale.
[138:12.58]Gonna keep the shield up, because I am scared of everything.
[138:17.78]Everything scares me.
[138:25.73]Alright!
[138:29.79]Oh, they don't do it.
[138:30.49]They only say that when they fall off.
[138:32.21]Yeah.
[138:36.05]I'm scared of chat.
[138:37.50]No, that's one thing that doesn't scare me.
[138:38.86]A lot of things scare me, but not chat.
[138:41.96]We're on the same team.
[138:45.54]If we weren't on the same team, then maybe I would be scared.
[138:49.42]But I know for a fact that you guys are on the same team.
[138:58.98]Fake bits.
[139:00.38]That's where I'm wrong.
[139:03.43]I don't think I'm wrong.
[139:05.01]Hey, thank you, Clink, for the five dollars.
[139:07.01]Hey, Jeremiah, here's some bits for you.
[139:08.23]I always found Demon's Souls to be the easiest of any Souls games, but I'm glad you're enjoying it.
[139:12.87]Um... I don't know, I think... From my understanding, this game... What?
[139:22.98]From my understanding, this game's... ...easiness...
[139:27.51]and how not difficult it is to complete is based around the fact that there are a few things in the game that are absolutely just broken.
[139:37.50]You can one-hit bosses in this game.
[139:39.54]You can sit in different areas.
[139:41.31]You can cheese bosses.
[139:43.59]There's a lot of cheese in Demon Slayer from what I read on the internet.
[139:48.43]And hold on.
[139:48.81]Let me just hold on before I fucking lose everything.
[140:05.40]So, yes.
[140:06.90]I guess technically this game is the easiest one, but I'm not even sure about that.
[140:13.44]I'm not sure it's the easiest game of the Souls series.
[140:20.26]Besides like a... I was going to say Dark Souls 2, but Dark Souls 2 was not... It's hard to say Dark Souls 2, because Dark Souls 2 has like fucking so much content at this point.
[140:30.48]There's like 78 bosses in Dark Souls 2.
[140:35.06]You know what I mean?
[140:35.48]Like, it's easy to be like, oh, there was a ton of easy shit in Dark Souls 2.
[140:39.07]Yeah, but they, like, they added, like, fucking nine DLCs.
[140:43.87]There's, like, fucking 40 zones in Dark Souls 2.
[140:46.47]So half of them are gonna be stupid.
[140:55.42]Come on, knock it down.
[140:56.14]I know you wanna do it.
[141:01.23]What?
[141:01.91]What?
[141:02.21]Hold on.
[141:02.55]Wait a minute.
[141:02.91]Was he the fucking... He was the... I took my eyes off the screen for a second, and he turned into the ball.
[141:14.33]This looks pretty conspicuous.
[141:21.90]Uh, this is the boss.
[141:23.46]I think.
[141:27.64]Don't even get... I don't even want to see you do a move.
[141:30.30]Buddy.
[141:51.27]But I think I do think I'm having more fun with Demon's Souls than I was with Dark Souls 1 or Dark Souls 2.
[142:00.68]I'm not sure why that is.
[142:03.04]I really don't know.
[142:03.80]I can't tell you.
[142:04.38]Oh, it's because of this, because of that.
[142:07.35]Maybe I could.
[142:09.15]I think I like the hub areas.
[142:12.61]I like the idea of having a centralized location for pretty much everything.
[142:16.72]In Dark Souls and even like, you know, Dark Souls 2 has it, but I feel like they spread themselves out so much with certain characters and certain things and NPCs and everything like that.
[142:29.08]But I do, I like that whole idea of touch the stone and go to the area and every area is kind of different.
[142:35.38]And there's, this is your content for the time being right now.
[142:41.70]And look, I'm not going to tell you that it's because I like that.
[142:47.20]Because I'm smart.
[142:48.78]No, I like it because it's easier on my brain.
[142:51.28]I feel like in Dark Souls 1, I had to remember everything.
[142:54.22]Like, everything was so connected that if I fucking didn't remember where the second area was, I was going to get lost for 45 minutes.
[143:02.33]Because the world was just so connected to each other.
[143:05.04]Now, that's really awesome.
[143:05.98]That's a really great gaming achievement.
[143:08.16]But just give it to me in little spouts.
[143:09.52]You know what I mean?
[143:10.62]Just give me a spout.
[143:11.84]Just pour me one glass of tea and let me enjoy the tea.
[143:14.38]And then I'm going to go back and go to the hub world.
[143:28.90]This place is kind of sprawling at this point.
[143:32.92]Whatever.
[143:36.94]high iq people prefer Demon's Souls no I just think I'm enjoying this game more than the others and there's the skip just don't die to the stupid guy down here and just open the door just alright just backstab him because he's obviously not paying attention
[143:57.49]Whoa!
[143:57.85]Whoa!
[143:59.53]Is it him?
[144:00.23]Huh?
[144:00.41]Get it!
[144:00.75]Get it!
[144:00.99]Open it!
[144:01.47]I gotta save him.
[144:02.85]Where is he?
[144:03.33]I didn't rescue you yet, we still have to fight.
[144:06.39]Dude, you're gonna leave me with these three?
[144:09.85]Hey!
[144:13.15]That's not nice!
[144:16.41]That's not nice.
[144:28.17]That was not nice.
[144:32.91]Where'd he go?
[144:33.27]I have a lot of, like, full moon grass now.
[144:37.32]This is good.
[144:37.78]Fire bombs.
[144:38.40]Alright, cool.
[144:41.76]Hey, thanks for rescuing me.
[144:42.72]Can you please kill all the enemies?
[144:44.68]This is the third time I've seen this guy.
[144:51.83]There's the boss.
[144:52.93]Give me your cool shield.
[144:54.91]Do I have- do I like- Pure Clearstone.
[144:56.39]Okay.
[145:20.62]I can wear the dumb hat, can't I?
[145:21.96]Alright, I got the stupid hat on.
[145:32.48]There's my Dark Souls outfit, guys.
[145:34.17]There's my Demon's Souls outfit.
[145:40.21]Bent-ass, flat-brimmed hat.
[145:46.97]Anything else that I missed before I inevitably die to this boss?
[145:54.76]Glad that I have it open.
[145:58.30]Yes, I did miss this shit.
[145:59.86]Over here.
[146:01.84]Bowling grass.
[146:04.04]I've got a lot of everything.
[146:05.62]It's okay.
[146:10.55]So we're going to attempt to fight whatever this is with the bone smasher.
[146:15.73]Oh, please.
[146:16.83]I'm trying to talk.
[146:18.11]I'm trying to speak.
[146:19.09]Missing anything else?
[146:25.52]I don't think so.
[146:27.10]Just in case.
[146:28.02]I knew it.
[146:28.38]Here we go.
[146:30.14]More moon grass.
[146:37.18]Actually hit me?
[146:43.43]My favorite part about these games is just seeing the glowy little thing on the ground and being like, ooh, I didn't get that yet.
[146:51.10]It has such a great feeling.
[146:53.44]No game since has been able to replicate that.
[146:55.60]That feeling of finding the thing and seeing the glow and picking it up and being like, that is awesome.
[147:00.57]I'm very happy about this.
[147:04.01]Legend of Zelda doesn't do this.
[147:06.87]Everybody's talking about Breath of the Wild.
[147:10.81]You don't do that in Breath of the Wild.
[147:12.03]Wait, the one illusion wall that I don't hit?
[147:25.54]What are you talking about?
[147:26.46]This?
[147:29.77]Where is it?
[147:30.91]What do you mean the one illusion wall that I don't hit?
[147:32.91]Are you serious?
[147:40.55]Not here, right?
[147:47.43]That sounded different.
[147:49.91]Oh, I got... I got jabronied.
[147:54.93]Oh my god, can you believe this streamer?
[147:57.13]This streaming guy is such a jabronie.
[148:01.61]Oh, hi.
[148:02.11]There you are.
[148:06.28]Okay, well... I got the skip now, I'm okay.
[148:10.20]Let me go open up the door that's back here at, uh... Where am I going?
[148:20.63]I'm going back to open the door.
[148:24.35]Alright, I got the skip, I'm fine.
[148:26.47]I'm right there.
[148:29.49]Guys, don't act like I'm some kind of brony, okay?
[148:34.54]So where is this door that's back here?
[148:39.81]I see one door.
[148:43.79]Ah.
[148:50.15]No.
[148:51.35]Is it up top?
[148:58.78]Oh, wait.
[148:59.28]There could be a door over here.
[149:00.66]It's possible.
[149:06.50]Am I really a jabroni right now?
[149:08.66]I can't be a fucking jabroni.
[149:13.48]Just get me out of here.
[149:14.52]Just jump it.
[149:24.03]Hello.
[149:24.39]I'm here?
[149:29.77]There's the magic door that I wanted.
[149:35.91]There's the magic door.
[149:36.95]Okay, what's in here?
[149:39.47]I hear twinkles.
[149:41.17]I do hear twinkling.
[149:42.73]Lots of it.
[149:45.05]Lots of it.
[149:45.55]I hear other footsteps too, though.
[149:47.08]I'm kind of scared right now.
[149:48.34]What is in here?
[149:50.42]To keep going down?
[149:51.36]What is down here?
[149:56.82]What the fuck is down here?
[149:58.00]It's like a jail.
[150:01.39]Okay.
[150:08.58]There it is.
[150:11.36]Bloody iron key.
[150:13.41]Let's get rid of this thing.
[150:14.99]Please don't like jump scare me and kill me.
[150:16.57]Something's gonna jump through one of these corridors.
[150:18.33]I know it.
[150:19.89]Shit.
[150:20.33]I know this is gonna happen.
[150:21.27]Something's gonna be right here and it's gonna kill me.
[150:22.99]I know it!
[150:27.34]No?
[150:29.60]Oh, this takes me to where?
[150:31.08]Behind the shopkeeper.
[150:32.16]That's cool.
[150:33.00]So what is it?
[150:34.52]Tower shield.
[150:38.83]Not that impressive.
[150:43.74]Although it might be.
[150:45.20]I like the regen on this though.
[150:48.20]It's doing me a lot of favors.
[150:55.42]There's another place to go.
[150:56.73]There's a lot of doors here.
[150:57.69]I hear more twinkling.
[151:00.83]Okay, so we got... One of these is gonna have something in it and then I'm gonna be scared and it's gonna kill me.
[151:14.34]I do... I gotta go back and spend these souls.
[151:16.04]I have a ton.
[151:18.12]Especially with the consumables that I have.
[151:26.13]Nothing?
[151:26.81]Illusion?
[151:31.11]Come on.
[151:34.04]Equip it?
[151:34.48]Equip the new shield.
[151:38.14]Why?
[151:45.95]Oh.
[151:46.77]Uh...
[151:48.85]Okay.
[151:50.79]No, I'm not gonna... I can't use it.
[151:52.73]It's too big.
[151:55.21]It makes me go... Guy in here?
[152:04.02]Prisoner?
[152:04.42]I don't like the way this guy looks.
[152:12.09]You killed that vile insect and saved me.
[152:15.47]I did.
[152:18.17]Why do I listen to chat?
[152:21.94]I don't know, because sometimes you guys give me the right thing.
[152:23.54]I was thinking about it.
[152:30.44]I was thinking about it.
[152:31.82]I was going to do it.
[152:34.16]I was going to hold down right trigger and just crush his head.
[152:39.81]But I can't.
[152:40.49]This is the first playthrough.
[152:41.33]You can't do dumb shit like that.
[152:42.49]I was going to crush him.
[152:52.92]Okay, well, I opened the door.
[152:54.46]That means he's going to end up in the Nexus, right?
[153:06.17]I do keep hearing this twinkling.
[153:11.31]It's just the not onion version of Sigward.
[153:14.69]Where is this?
[153:15.62]I guess here it is, right?
[153:38.57]Did I miss it down here?
[153:39.65]No, I can't hear it anymore.
[153:41.27]Maybe they have a door above me?
[153:42.37]Oh well.
[153:50.00]I think there's another door anyways.
[153:54.96]I'm not going insane.
[153:55.90]There is a very loud, audible twinkle right now.
[154:06.23]Secret doors or something?
[154:13.71]There's too many secrets in these games.
[154:14.99]You know, like, you guys know that they just barely somebody found something in Demon's Souls.
[154:20.74]Like, 10, 15 years later.
[154:25.60]Somebody found a new secret in Demon's Souls.
[154:29.87]Like, a month ago.
[154:32.07]That's a... Got it.
[154:43.77]I hear that shit, but I don't know where it is.
[154:52.94]Checkmate.
[154:53.54]Yeah, they found, like, a new area.
[154:58.46]I guess there was an entire zone that, like, people just... Somebody just found out exists.
[155:04.46]You can't... It's, like, in the game dev code.
[155:08.04]You have to open it up in Notepad or something to find it.
[155:20.48]Did not come even remotely over here.
[155:26.64]Yeah, you open up notepad.exe and you drag Dark Souls, you drag Demon's Souls, you dump it on like as a ROM onto your hard drive.
[155:37.93]And then you go demonsouls.exe, you drop that onto notepad.
[155:44.35]And it'll pull up a bunch of code and stuff.
[155:45.77]And you have to run that through a... A denounced reverse sprinkler.
[155:52.07]And you end up with, like, another couple lines of code.
[155:54.70]Is that all that was up here?
[156:04.72]I think that's all that was here.
[156:07.12]What of you?
[156:09.44]If I had the thing to, like, write right now, I'd say, what of you?
[156:15.21]Okay, let's go.
[156:20.15]Yeah, it was the Giants level, yeah.
[156:28.61]Alright, let's go back.
[156:32.79]That was recently found.
[156:34.52]This year, right?
[156:38.60]I don't think I can do anything else.
[156:44.93]You use notepad for code, right?
[156:48.46]Don't you guys know that?
[156:51.20]When guys are making video games and shit, they're using notepad.
[157:08.49]Dangerous.
[157:10.93]Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.
[157:12.36]Just go, go, go.
[157:25.03]Yeah, you open up Notepad and that's where you type.
[157:29.73]They use a calculator.
[157:30.83]Yeah, they use a calculator.
[157:35.97]Let's get some endurance.
[157:41.75]Okay, what is the game development code?
[157:45.55]What do they use to make Demon's Souls?
[157:47.53]Does anybody know?
[158:00.22]Gonna make this here.
[158:02.96]Just put him in here.
[158:03.72]Wait, what do you mean don't go back?
[158:07.31]What do you mean I went back to the Nexus, I fucked up everything?
[158:09.27]What are you talking about?
[158:10.41]I opened up the skip.
[158:11.71]I opened up the giant door.
[158:17.25]Right?
[158:19.23]That's how these games work.
[158:22.43]At least I hope that's how they work.
[158:23.79]Unity?
[158:26.23]Unity?
[158:29.32]Demon's Souls is a Minecraft custom map.
[158:31.75]Do you know how zoomed out they'd have to be and how many blocks it would take to do this?
[158:42.89]Shortcuts weren't invented yet.
[158:46.29]Yes, they were.
[158:52.57]This is definitely not Unity.
[158:59.94]I just put them in the belt.
[159:01.92]I didn't realize I had that many.
[159:08.59]Here we go, 2,000.
[159:11.37]Imagine how much redstone they had to use.
[159:16.31]Yeah, that's a lot.
[159:18.87]That's a lot of redstone.
[159:23.83]Like, imagine this was made in Minecraft.
[159:31.33]Even just, okay, even just this image right here.
[159:34.76]Just take a screenshot.
[159:35.64]Imagine this was a Minecraft map.
[159:37.08]Take a screenshot here.
[159:40.48]This would probably take, like, 20 years of Minecraft to make this.
[159:45.16]Like, look at this.
[159:49.83]It is.
[159:50.33]It is.
[159:50.91]Shut up, Ed.
[159:51.69]Let me deposit some of this crap.
[159:55.17]Wait, I want to look at these.
[160:14.58]I'm just curious.
[160:15.32]I want to know what the greatsword and... I picked up something else too, didn't I?
[160:22.80]Yeah, I just want to see how the greatsword handles.
[160:24.32]Okay, it's just another version of the dragon bone.
[160:32.67]Except it's not as cool looking.
[160:35.23]It doesn't do as much damage.
[160:36.19]There's a scaling on this thing.
[160:42.37]D. B. Jesus Christ.
[160:46.49]Store it.
[160:48.59]If you sneeze three times, you die.
[160:49.71]Did we ever talk about that?
[160:52.01]Okay, I'm going to bring something up.
[160:54.82]Did we ever discuss this?
[160:56.42]That if you sneezed three times over the course of your life, you would die on the third sneeze?
[161:03.75]You know how hard that would be to live?
[161:06.34]No, no, no.
[161:06.86]Imagine you get 10 sneezes over the course of your whole life.
[161:10.93]And on the 10th sneeze, you instantly, your brain turns off.
[161:14.31]Your heart stops and you die.
[161:17.61]You know what you would go through?
[161:18.75]You know how you get that feeling I'm about to sneeze?
[161:22.01]People would go through anything to not have that happen.
[161:24.53]You know, you would, like, shove fucking lemons in your eyes, and you would, like, squeeze your nutsack to, like, not sneeze!
[161:30.86]But still, you'd, like, you'd grab your nuts, you're like, Oh, these are fucked!
[161:33.92]That was one!
[161:34.44]How many did I do?
[161:35.14]Because you can make yourself not sneeze.
[161:39.87]I've done it before, lots of times.
[161:53.54]Because sometimes you can't help it, but it can be helped.
[161:56.61]If you, like, grab, like, you would just grab the nearest can or the nearest device, and you would just smash it into your face or something to make sure you didn't sneeze.
[162:04.89]And all those people that are at, like, the ninth sneeze, oh, you're gonna be at a funeral soon.
[162:12.03]You know, like, and all your friends, all your friends would know that.
[162:14.94]Like, you know, like, the guy that sneezed seven or eight times already.
[162:17.78]Imagine hanging out with that guy.
[162:21.44]You're on like the bumper boats?
[162:23.32]You're on like the go-karts?
[162:26.04]Or you're like sitting on a plane with them?
[162:28.58]Hey, did you see that latest episode of Gray's Anatomy?
[162:32.89]Yeah, me too.
[162:34.27]It was really cool.
[162:36.21]I liked how she, uh, when she went to- It's like, what do you do?
[162:46.28]You're on a plane with the guy!
[162:50.79]You're on a plane with this guy.
[162:56.10]Did you tell anybody?
[162:57.76]Excuse me, excuse me, miss.
[163:00.64]That's his tenth sneeze.
[163:02.74]And it's like, oh, alright.
[163:07.22]I could put him in a body bag and ship him back to wherever he was.
[163:14.58]What's the problem with my shirt?
[163:16.66]Why does everybody have a problem?
[163:17.67]It's Captain America.
[163:20.11]This is an underoos.
[163:22.33]Look it up.
[163:23.39]U-N-D-E-R-R-O-O-S.
[163:25.87]Underoos.
[163:26.51]It's underwear.
[163:27.07]I'm wearing, like, male underwear.
[163:33.82]They just open up the plane and drop them on it.
[163:38.28]You would be on, like, the subway.
[163:39.68]Somebody would... People would just be sneezing.
[163:41.54]How many times do you hear somebody sneeze a day?
[163:44.48]It's actually kind of weird because I don't... Not very many.
[163:47.24]So this wouldn't be as big of a deal as we're making it sound.
[163:52.73]I think over the course of an entire day, if I, let's say I went to like, like PAX East, for instance.
[163:59.74]Maybe you'll hear three sneezes over the course of the whole weekend.
[164:04.48]So statistically, it wouldn't even, a lot of people probably wouldn't even die sneezing on the 10th sneeze.
[164:12.47]You look up, like, statistics.
[164:14.91]It's like, oh, and here we have the yearly statistics of how people died in the United States.
[164:20.95]Oh, here we have, at number three, we have the car accidents with 525.
[164:25.02]At number two, it's getting hit by a bus at 1,444.
[164:31.10]And again, oddly enough, you know, how is this possible?
[164:35.56]At number one, tenth sneeze.
[164:39.00]68 million people died last year.
[164:45.00]You would just be like, oh yeah, of course.
[164:52.90]What the fuck am I talking about?
[164:54.47]I'm talking about... Look.
[164:57.89]I'm about to buy 18 of these.
[164:58.91]No, I'm not.
[165:00.55]That's a mistake.
[165:04.57]Or is it?
[165:05.75]No, I have enough healing right now.
[165:08.95]I just need to get, like, how many more souls?
[165:15.36]How many do I need?
[165:19.90]13,000.
[165:20.30]Let's get endurance to 24.
[165:22.62]24, 24.
[165:22.74]So I need, like, another couple thousand.
[165:27.09]No, you know what?
[165:28.19]I already have it.
[165:30.35]I'm not gonna use the stupid spear.
[165:32.17]Get out of here.
[165:35.39]Shit, it's only 1,500.
[165:36.83]What the fuck?
[165:39.97]I thought it was gonna be much more than that.
[165:47.25]Well, looks like we have to go farm 4-1 for a minute or two here.
[165:56.80]The legendary 11th sneeze.
[165:59.80]Yep, and there would be that guy.
[166:01.28]There'd be that guy or that girl that would sneeze the 11th time and be terrified.
[166:07.85]And here comes the last sneeze and you sneezed
[166:11.53]You're about to fucking sneeze and you just call.
[166:14.31]You call your mother.
[166:16.11]You're like, Mom, I'm going to sneeze for the 10th time.
[166:18.02]I love you.
[166:20.02]And you don't die.
[166:22.10]And then all of a sudden you become like the guy, like the new Superman.
[166:26.75]And they want to dissect you and find out why you didn't die on the 11th sneeze.
[166:30.95]Or the 10th sneeze.
[166:43.02]I'm using a greatsword right now.
[166:46.58]I need to take the greatsword off.
[166:53.99]Just go smash some people.
[167:01.49]Yep, just died in one hit.
[167:03.28]A little more.
[167:05.80]Come on, come on down.
[167:06.70]Skate down here.
[167:11.46]You just gotta treat them like Bald Bull from Super Punch Out.
[167:16.31]That's how you do it.
[167:18.85]Nope, I fucked it up.
[167:40.91]Wasn't it Mike Tyson, too?
[167:48.86]Wait, didn't they run into syndication issues with that game?
[167:53.69]It was Mike Tyson presents Punch-Out, and then it was just regular Punch-Out.
[167:58.43]And then they replaced Mike Tyson with Mr. Dream or something, right?
[168:02.43]What happened there?
[168:03.09]What's the story with that?
[168:04.07]I'm going to kill this guy right now.
[168:19.45]I'm killing this guy.
[168:21.06]Let's go.
[168:21.72]You don't think you wanna fuck with me?
[168:33.30]Big mistake.
[168:41.57]Come on, buddy.
[168:55.68]Whoa!
[168:56.60]Too greedy.
[169:02.84]Oh!
[169:05.82]Oh, don't you dare do it.
[169:11.39]I'm in a bad place for this ship.
[169:15.95]And he's dead and dead.
[169:18.77]What do I get for this?
[169:20.13]Anything?
[169:25.57]A whole lot of numbers.
[169:27.29]Gray Demon Soul.
[169:32.13]Okay.
[169:35.97]Alright, I'm alright with that.
[169:42.38]Another boss down, right?
[169:43.48]What does the Gray Demon Soul get me?
[169:48.06]Do I have enough?
[169:48.62]Yeah, I have enough.
[169:51.44]It's just free souls, huh?
[169:54.39]I'm okay with that.
[169:58.96]Let's act like an enemy from this area.
[170:07.65]Life is pain.
[170:12.21]Is he not finishing 1-3?
[170:13.21]No, I'm getting enough souls so I can level up one more time.
[170:23.40]Gray or gray?
[170:25.42]I think I write G-R-E-Y.
[170:28.64]Let's go into endurance.
[170:32.34]Alright, I am now happy.
[170:35.18]I'm now happy.
[170:40.44]Only six streams later, I finally beat the tutorial boss.
[170:45.40]Hey, come on.
[170:48.85]Yeah, the tutorial's over.
[170:50.05]I beat the tutorial.
[170:52.51]I did it, guys.
[170:59.24]D-R-E-Y.
[170:59.80]Uh, Rebio, thanks for the three bucks.
[171:10.99]Hey, Jerma, any plans to play Okami HD when the PC PS4 port comes out?
[171:17.37]Uh, no.
[171:18.75]Probably not.
[171:20.75]I recognize Okami as one of those games that's just one of the greatest, one of the greats.
[171:28.46]But I don't think I would want to stream that game.
[171:32.46]Because Okami for me is like Zelda.
[171:37.09]It's not... I'm not going to piss anybody off.
[171:44.11]Not tonight.
[171:44.77]This is a very positive, fun stream.
[171:46.33]I'm not going to piss anybody off tonight.
[171:53.67]And I am taking a lot of hits from these guys, that's for sure.
[171:56.47]And then, you know, I might even fucking die.
[171:58.44]Stupid ass horse.
[172:02.98]Nope, not going to make anybody angry tonight.
[172:06.00]Sorry.
[172:16.17]Zelda is not... No, I'm not going to say that.
[172:19.32]Zelda is very fun.
[172:20.56]Zelda is a fun game.
[172:25.44]How do I say this without making 500 million people angry?
[172:28.96]You know, I can't... No, I'm not even going to say it.
[172:32.30]I can't say it.
[172:33.54]I can't say it.
[172:35.48]Because I am speaking from ignorance.
[172:37.39]So I'm not going to do it.
[172:39.53]You know what I'm saying?
[172:44.63]I would be completely and totally speaking from ignorance.
[172:47.37]I'm not going to be that guy.
[172:57.83]Zelda... Zelda is a great franchise.
[173:01.69]Wonderful fucking... I love it.
[173:03.32]It's a classic Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, Link, and Zelda.
[173:09.32]They're up there with the greats.
[173:13.92]But in a world... In a world where, like... In a world where, like, GTA 5 exists...
[173:29.36]I feel like Nintendo needs to do a little more with that franchise and not just like go save the princess again.
[173:35.50]You know what I mean?
[173:38.34]Like in a world where like Dark Souls 3 comes out and it's just like fucking unbelievable.
[173:43.96]You know, I just... And Breath of the Wild, look, that's why I told you I'm speaking out of ignorance.
[173:48.28]That's what I'm talking about.
[173:50.06]I'm speaking out of ignorance.
[173:51.76]But every Zelda game I've ever played, you know, obviously the Super Nintendo ones are different because a lot of the, like, side-scrollers.
[173:59.32]At least, like, length of the past, you know what I mean?
[174:02.00]But... I don't know.
[174:03.98]I just like the, like, do the water temple.
[174:05.64]Do this temple.
[174:06.25]You're gonna get the Master Sword.
[174:07.97]You're gonna get the Goron Blade.
[174:09.39]And I just feel like I played the same game five times in a row.
[174:15.17]Breath of the Wild's different, though, because in Breath of the Wild, they did something different.
[174:18.17]They, like, did an open world, giant world, and I get that.
[174:20.94]And that's why I told you I'm speaking out of ignorance.
[174:25.51]Out of total ignorance.
[174:28.22]I know I'm not comparing Zelda to GTA.
[174:30.21]I'm talking about just like advancements in like... We've come so far in video games and there's so much more technology that going to save Princess Zelda is not that interesting anymore.
[174:42.68]That's my point.
[174:55.00]I'm going to state this as clear as I can.
[174:57.26]I'm going to act like a politician here.
[174:58.84]I'm going to state this very clearly.
[175:01.99]Great franchise.
[175:03.97]Wonderful franchise.
[175:04.89]I love it.
[175:05.65]Beautiful.
[175:06.05]Perfect.
[175:08.59]It's not really my cup of tea anymore.
[175:11.09]Not something that I'm excited for anymore.
[175:14.86]I also don't have a Switch.
[175:16.78]And I don't want to buy a Switch.
[175:18.96]And Super Mario Odyssey looks like it's going to be fucking fantastic.
[175:21.96]It just does.
[175:23.23]But Nintendo is one of those companies where you have to justify buying the whole console for like two games.
[175:30.17]That's just how it's always been.
[175:31.41]That's the way it is.
[175:33.27]You buy the Nintendo console because you want to play the new Zelda or the new Mario.
[175:36.73]That's just the way it is.
[175:39.50]And I'm not at that stage yet.
[175:41.04]I haven't got there yet.
[175:49.64]Now do it in your Trump voice.
[175:50.96]What?
[175:56.16]It's different now, Jeremy.
[175:57.59]It's different.
[176:00.97]Yeah, and look, I don't- I'm not gonna be one of those people that's like, Nintendo suck, did you see E3 last year?
[176:05.81]Okay, wait, wait, wait, calm down.
[176:08.91]I gotta pay attention.
[176:10.13]Pay attention!
[176:10.64]Sorry.
[176:11.12]Fucking Zelda sucks.
[176:13.10]Zelda's the stupidest fucking- That was a joke.
[176:19.08]That was a joke.
[176:19.58]We're joking.
[176:30.25]Oh, fucking hell.
[176:33.82]I'm taking it.
[176:34.44]I don't even care.
[176:36.30]I ain't doing this right now.
[176:38.38]Not 50% of max health.
[176:39.60]Not a chance.
[176:42.62]No, I love Zelda.
[176:43.90]Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite video game experiences ever.
[176:47.54]I remember I got my first girlfriend when I was playing Ocarina of Time.
[176:58.08]I was in the front with my friend.
[177:00.68]I was riding through Hyrule Field.
[177:04.29]When you're on the horse.
[177:06.53]And I got a call from one of my friends.
[177:08.27]I was like 60% of the way through the game.
[177:11.85]And he's like, hey dude, she likes you.
[177:14.59]And I'm like, are you serious, dude?
[177:17.25]And I was so happy that this girl liked me.
[177:22.63]That was, like, the most important thing.
[177:24.61]And I will never forget it.
[177:25.63]And I got, like, a girlfriend that, like, evening.
[177:29.83]Sitting there, hanging out, playing The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
[177:37.40]Was her name Zelda?
[177:38.52]No, it wasn't.
[177:39.28]It was Cynthia.
[177:42.28]It wasn't Cynthia.
[177:43.60]That's a joke.
[177:52.50]Yeah, those games have a Mario Galaxy.
[177:55.32]I mean, come on.
[177:58.55]Mario 64, those are games... Those games came out in the prime of my teenage years.
[178:03.57]Like, I was like 13 or 14.
[178:06.25]I may even be younger than that.
[178:07.25]I was like 12 or like 13 when that game came out.
[178:11.25]And holy shit, can you imagine if Super Mario 64 was your first real experience in a Mario franchise?
[178:19.58]That turned the world upside down.
[178:23.92]Super Mario 64 turned the world upside down.
[178:27.32]And then motherfuckers made Glover.
[178:30.28]The industry has not changed, guys.
[178:31.58]You know what I mean?
[178:36.09]Companies are still making Glover.
[178:47.07]Everybody thinks the industry has gone so much further and changed.
[178:49.47]No, it has not.
[178:57.48]Just a different game or a different genre.
[179:05.45]What is Glover?
[179:07.01]You don't know what Glover is.
[179:07.94]I mean, you kind of have to look it up to know what it actually, what it truly is.
[179:14.36]I bought that game and I cried.
[179:15.32]No, no, I didn't buy it.
[179:17.96]Sorry, sorry.
[179:18.32]I rented it.
[179:19.10]I rented it from Blockbuster.
[179:21.22]And I remember being so upset that I hated it so much that I cried.
[179:27.45]I don't like the double, the two R2s.
[179:30.27]The double R1 on this thing is awful.
[179:32.87]You turn around and you swing behind you.
[179:34.15]Just don't do it, is what I'm saying.
[179:42.28]Glover was so bad.
[179:43.42]Like, come on.
[179:44.39]Don't even... If somebody... Don't even defend Glover.
[179:46.69]How dare you?
[179:49.71]Oh, cool.
[179:50.21]I can be a different Glover and roll around in a ball.
[179:53.65]Oh, man.
[179:54.63]You didn't cry when you played Glover for the first time?
[179:56.73]Alright.
[179:58.77]Fucking holy shit.
[179:59.45]Hold on.
[180:03.25]They all have spears.
[180:04.01]They're all doing the fucking lunge.
[180:08.73]Oh, my god.
[180:09.73]These guys are unbearable.
[180:10.79]Run back.
[180:19.63]Damn it!
[180:20.11]Damn it!
[180:20.75]Damn it!
[180:21.31]Damn it!
[180:21.83]Damn it!
[180:22.95]God damn it!
[180:27.43]You have to run that fast.
[180:32.51]I'm actually going to have to take the shield off of these idiots.
[180:40.67]Of course, that didn't hit fucking anybody.
[180:47.19]One damage to that fucking dickhead.
[180:50.07]What in the name of fucking God is happening right now?
[180:56.65]Don't eat my fucking ass, really.
[181:06.38]It's not fair!
[181:07.20]It just isn't fair!
[181:08.84]It's too many people!
[181:14.01]Oh, I... I fucking hate these guys.
[181:19.92]I'm using all of my healing on these fucking moronic enemies.
[181:23.24]It's just, pick, pick, it's like pick which door you want to open.
[181:31.06]Because like, when I put the shield down, one of the other ones is going to fucking swing.
[181:36.27]Get out of here, you dickheads.
[181:40.07]And that's what happens when you fucking put, oh, I fucking hate spears.
[181:44.37]I fucking hate spears in these games.
[181:46.75]It doesn't fucking matter.
[181:48.85]Oh.
[181:49.62]Oh, fucking Glover sucks.
[181:51.62]Glover sucks.
[181:52.52]It's not even fucking remotely fun.
[181:59.45]The stupid dashing like... God, I can beat Flameworker on the first fucking try without ever playing it ever before.
[182:09.95]But you put like a fucking dumb three enemies with a spear.
[182:13.97]And I will lose every single time.
[182:18.55]I'm not even gonna fucking recover now.
[182:19.73]Like, it's like... Oh, I hate that shit more than anything.
[182:24.45]The infinite fucking stamina sprint at you holding a spear out.
[182:27.98]It's the same thing with the fucking roly-poly assholes in 4.1.
[182:30.72]They're fucking stupid.
[182:31.78]It's dumb design.
[182:32.92]The game's terrible.
[182:33.84]It's not even worth playing.
[182:34.90]Don't ever play this game.
[182:36.12]In fact, go play Legend of Zelda.
[182:37.76]That's a good fucking adventure game.
[182:39.10]Go get it.
[182:40.10]Breath of the Wild is in stores now.
[182:41.50]You should play it.
[182:42.38]It's much better than this.
[182:43.96]Don't ever download this game.
[182:55.60]Get good and counter them.
[183:00.56]Go play Glover.
[183:04.14]Stupid fucking spear enemies.
[183:06.59]Why does every one of you have a spear in this area?
[183:09.33]All of you have to have one.
[183:12.63]You all need to have a spear.
[183:13.83]Everybody.
[183:14.41]Every one of you.
[183:16.35]Fucking idiots.
[183:18.05]Does that guy have a spear?
[183:18.89]Oh, I want one too.
[183:20.23]Me too.
[183:25.08]We only have spears!
[183:26.24]Over here.
[183:44.73]I can't.
[183:45.03]I have this stupid half-health thing.
[183:46.50]I gotta just put a... Oh, I hate these guys.
[183:50.04]I don't even know why I'm fighting them.
[183:51.30]I don't even have to.
[183:58.70]Put on that stupid ring.
[184:07.52]Shit, I can't even take it off.
[184:09.96]Oh, fuck it.
[184:10.46]Just... Just grow up.
[184:13.35]Just grow up and kill them.
[184:15.97]Like, grow up.
[184:16.65]You know what I mean?
[184:19.89]I might even just put the claymore on.
[184:21.19]Because these guys... I can't swing fast enough with the fucking bone marrow.
[184:25.08]Oh.
[184:26.68]Yeah, I'm putting on the claymore.
[184:27.70]Like, this is too slow right now.
[184:29.69]It just is.
[184:30.01]Like, I can actually swing this thing in less than... It takes like three seconds to swing that fucking sword.
[184:52.26]Why not just run by them?
[184:53.18]Because you have to kill every enemy one time in these games.
[184:56.20]It's important.
[184:58.47]I can put armor back on now too.
[185:04.44]Oh.
[185:04.84]My.
[185:05.56]Fucking.
[185:06.14]God.
[185:09.81]You can shoot me through the goddamn window.
[185:12.75]Don't you fucking even dare.
[185:15.12]Ay yi yi.
[185:25.23]Glover player would have killed them all first try.
[185:30.98]You know, that's true.
[185:34.42]Ow, that hurt my hand.
[185:35.28]I can't take this off.
[185:36.26]It burns my hand if I try to take that off.
[185:40.44]Come on, no.
[185:51.15]I don't have enough health to do this shit.
[185:54.95]And they still have all the arrows.
[186:06.20]Don't get surrounded by these guys.
[186:07.86]Don't not get surrounded.
[186:09.12]There's nowhere to go.
[186:19.08]See?
[186:19.87]There's not.
[186:20.65]These guys... There's nowhere to go.
[186:23.62]No matter what you do, these guys, they'll always be one next to you, swinging at you.
[186:27.96]Always.
[186:28.46]No matter what.
[186:28.88]These stupid fucking... I'm just going by them.
[186:36.63]I'm not fighting these enemies.
[186:37.55]They're fucking stupid.
[186:45.14]That enemy is such trash.
[186:54.11]Fuck that, man.
[186:54.97]Like, seriously, fuck that shit.
[186:59.03]And I'm gonna die to the dogs now.
[187:00.44]I'm dead.
[187:07.56]See, really, don't do this to me now.
[187:09.70]Just fucking die.
[187:18.09]You have to kill every enemy at least one time.
[187:21.33]Except for we're gonna put three of the exact same bullshit spear enemy in the same spot and all of them are gonna run at you.
[187:28.78]You can't get away.
[187:29.44]They're just gonna spam their move at you the whole time.
[187:34.71]There's nothing you're gonna be able to do about that.
[187:36.39]You want to dodge?
[187:37.45]Go for it.
[187:37.81]There's another guy right next to you doing an attack right next to you because he does the same run at you move.
[187:43.65]The distance closing is absolutely fucking stupid.
[187:57.11]Those are the guys, those are the skeleton, those are the bone skeletons.
[188:00.57]But, wait, they actually, like, can hurt you.
[188:05.12]It's like fighting three of those dumb roly-poly bone skeletons at the same time.
[188:08.66]Except they swing 5000% faster.
[188:20.67]Like, by themselves, they're not that hard.
[188:22.21]But when you put three in the exact same spot, it becomes fucking unbearable.
[188:29.74]We're just gonna be a fat fuck.
[188:37.21]God, what a mess.
[188:48.11]Is there a skeleton that isn't a bone skeleton?
[188:56.51]No, don't, don't, don't.
[188:57.65]Please.
[188:58.37]Just would you please.
[188:59.81]Would you please.
[189:00.73]God, I hate this shit more than anyone.
[189:06.77]I'm still taking so much damage.
[189:08.09]Holy fuck.
[189:11.09]No, you know what?
[189:12.05]I... I'm done with this shit.
[189:15.13]I want to see what the boss is.
[189:16.83]Out of my fucking way.
[189:18.80]Second worst enemy in the game.
[189:20.26]Get out of my fucking face.
[189:21.36]Now this is the...
[189:41.93]This enemy is fucking stupid.
[189:45.04]It's stupid.
[189:46.28]You can't even... Oh my god.
[189:51.24]The hardest bosses in the game have not given me this much trouble.
[189:56.64]These three enemies are harder than the hardest boss in the whole game.
[190:00.21]Because I already beat it.
[190:00.99]I already beat the hardest boss in the fucking whole game.
[190:05.07]And these guys are worse than that fucking boss.
[190:08.61]Like 20 times worse.
[190:20.99]I don't think I have a bow.
[190:21.89]Do I have to go get a bow to complete this part of the fucking game?
[190:29.32]Roll behind and backstab.
[190:30.62]Not when there's three of them doing the same thing.
[190:33.78]No fucking way.
[190:35.68]If there was one, if there was two, I could see how that would be possible.
[190:39.30]Rolling behind one of these guys.
[190:40.67]No, it's not gonna work.
[190:42.85]It's not gonna happen.
[190:49.85]I almost just swung at that guy.
[191:05.20]It's not fair, there's three of them.
[191:13.32]It is true, it sucks.
[191:15.36]I'm gonna- I will complain about it.
[191:19.07]I don't think it's a bad- I don't think it's a bad game.
[191:22.39]I'm gonna complain about this spot.
[191:24.69]Because they kind of just threw up like a bunch of random fucking enemies in the same spot.
[191:28.23]They just threw up like a bunch of these enemies.
[191:31.63]This spot is just- this is just dumb.
[191:33.13]They just- they just puked up fucking like ten of these guys.
[191:36.25]And three of them the same spear enemy.
[191:37.99]Like, what is that?
[191:38.63]What is this dark- is this fucking scholar the first set?
[191:41.31]Or what?
[191:41.57]That's what they did in scholar.
[191:45.51]And it was stupid.
[191:54.83]They all got bows and shit.
[192:20.08]I need to get a bow and shoot one of these guys at the time.
[192:35.31]Alright, come on.
[192:41.69]I'm taking so much damage.
[192:42.85]This is such a bad place to have no armor.
[193:02.47]It's too scary.
[193:03.69]It's too dangerous.
[193:08.24]Just follow your nose!
[193:09.74]The fucking horse just blocked me.
[193:18.18]Fuck off.
[193:18.62]I don't even care.
[193:22.15]I don't care.
[193:26.29]Let's go in the fog.
[193:31.23]Wait a minute.
[193:34.61]Get him, quick, quick, before his friends come back.
[193:36.03]Come on!
[193:36.87]Before his friends come back.
[193:38.31]Get him before his friends come back.
[193:43.59]Q. Get the fucking dumb one.
[193:53.26]Oh, no, no, I didn't want to backstab him.
[193:54.84]I didn't want to backstab him.
[193:55.99]Oh my god, they're fucking... Okay, this is perfect.
[193:57.45]Perfect.
[194:11.48]Yeah, fuck you game.
[194:13.02]Fuck you.
[194:13.54]That's what you get.
[194:15.31]Eat shit.
[194:16.47]Wow.
[194:22.43]You want me to cheese an enemy?
[194:23.55]I'll cheese these guys.
[194:24.45]I don't care.
[194:25.03]Go overhead smash.
[194:32.04]Okay, I beat him.
[194:32.52]I have too many souls.
[194:43.48]I beat him.
[194:43.92]Okay.
[194:45.54]Do I have too many?
[194:46.16]No, it's alright.
[194:46.70]Let's just go.
[194:47.10]Let's go see what the boss does.
[194:52.07]See, that wasn't hard.
[194:55.73]Some things in these games, man, that just don't... That didn't go through QA enough.
[195:07.50]What is this?
[195:12.30]Is this boss, like, just this guy here?
[195:14.60]He's not laughing anymore.
[195:31.09]No.
[195:32.15]Is that a guy with a giant spear?
[195:36.05]No, it's not a spear.
[195:36.79]It's a sword.
[195:42.26]Hopefully I'm not too slow for this guy.
[195:44.87]What's going on right now?
[195:49.21]What's going on?
[195:49.67]Who's fighting?
[195:51.39]Who's he fighting?
[195:54.54]Was that him just talking?
[195:58.10]I'm so confused right now.
[195:59.32]Was that the guy that was just talking to me?
[196:04.21]Who is in here right now?
[196:08.90]What is fucking going on?
[196:10.16]Ow!
[196:10.22]Fuck!
[196:16.32]No, don't kill me!
[196:21.51]I beat him!
[196:22.21]I beat the Penetrator!
[196:28.03]That was fucking so stupid.
[196:30.93]What is happening?
[196:32.29]Hey!
[196:32.63]Wait a minute!
[196:33.76]No!
[196:34.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[196:37.63]Wait!
[196:38.21]Hey!
[196:38.99]Hey, wait!
[196:41.57]I have so many souls.
[196:42.49]Don't kill me!
[196:44.05]What are you doing?
[196:44.75]What happened?
[196:45.57]Why is this guy fighting me?
[196:49.78]Oh my god.
[196:55.80]Do I have to kill this guy?
[196:57.78]How did I aggro this guy?
[197:00.49]Oh, shit!
[197:01.91]Oh!
[197:03.51]Is the boss dead?
[197:04.31]The boss is dead, right?
[197:13.68]Shit!
[197:15.24]What?
[197:16.00]I got him a shield.
[197:20.41]He's dead.
[197:20.99]Fuck you!
[197:22.43]He's not dead!
[197:40.05]That was stupid.
[197:40.57]I don't even know what to say about that one.
[197:47.20]Wait, what do you mean?
[197:49.38]What happened?
[197:57.24]What are you talking about?
[198:00.24]What are you talking about?
[198:08.84]What do you mean I fucked it up?
[198:11.43]That guy was trying to kill me.
[198:16.57]Yeah, I know I let that guy out of his cell, but, like, the guy I was trying to kill, I should not have killed that guy.
[198:23.07]That's the guy that I... I know that's the guy I freed from prison, but it's either me or him at this point.
[198:30.01]Just... I shouldn't... But I couldn't just use the Archstone, because I'm overburdened.
[198:36.40]I...
[198:45.11]I was just confused what was happening.
[198:46.45]The boss died in like fucking 10 seconds.
[198:51.77]I know that guy... Look, I understand that guy was helping me with the boss.
[198:56.57]But afterwards, I was going to lose like 50,000 souls if I... That guy... He would have been aggroed to me.
[199:10.90]Restart the whole game.
[199:17.23]I could've just left, but I, what, I, whatever, I got his good shit.
[199:20.32]I took his fucking items.
[199:23.16]Look at this.
[199:26.32]Uh, that's some, that's some free shit right here.
[199:29.08]And he's got a ton of stuff on the ground.
[199:35.91]This is like killing Solaire.
[199:42.20]Whatever.
[199:42.62]It don't matter.
[199:43.36]Look, it's my first playthrough.
[199:44.82]It don't matter.
[199:45.32]And it's gonna free some stuff up.
[199:58.20]I already have the item burden on.
[200:01.50]We have free shit.
[200:02.94]How was I supposed to... What?
[200:10.68]Wait, did I just kill the guy that's the equivalent of the praise the sun guy in this game?
[200:15.51]Is that why everyone's so angry?
[200:19.57]Why does it matter?
[200:27.37]You give me... Okay, so I killed the sun bro.
[200:31.15]I'm so sorry.
[200:36.41]Doesn't even matter.
[200:38.20]That guy didn't even get introduced until Dark Souls.
[200:44.13]Oh, well.
[200:44.85]Oh, well.
[200:45.83]Sorry.
[200:50.29]He would have helped me against a very difficult boss.
[200:52.33]Now I'm fucked.
[200:52.92]Well, whatever.
[200:53.52]I don't want to co-op bosses.
[200:55.06]I want to do it on my own.
[201:06.06]I've played multiple Dark Souls games.
[201:07.51]How did I not know that was happening?
[201:08.75]Well, I didn't care at that point.
[201:10.57]Like, I knew what was going on.
[201:11.57]Like, who cares?
[201:19.80]Some NPCs die, some NPCs don't die.
[201:21.86]That's just how it works.
[201:25.14]I need to get rid of some shit.
[201:29.78]This is too heavy.
[201:39.28]Let me drop this.
[201:47.57]This guy sure did have a lot of good shit.
[201:49.25]His armor is so heavy.
[201:56.83]Didn't deposit the swords.
[201:59.85]I forgive you.
[202:00.85]I can't even reload the save.
[202:03.74]That's not even possible.
[202:08.34]If I reload the save, it already saved.
[202:16.88]Shit, is this stuff even going to be on the ground when I come back?
[202:23.36]You let patches live, but killed Bjor.
[202:30.89]Yeah, I got shit to do.
[202:33.37]It'll be gone.
[202:33.93]Fuck.
[202:36.37]What can I throw on the ground that I don't need, then?
[202:37.91]Shit.
[202:47.88]What do I have that I can get rid of this way's shitload of?
[202:51.04]I can just draw a great axe.
[202:53.36]I don't need this shit.
[202:56.42]Shields.
[203:01.49]I'm gonna keep the claymore.
[203:03.93]That's his large shield.
[203:09.15]Purple flame shield.
[203:10.19]I mean, how cool, how good is his thing?
[203:19.23]What do I have?
[203:19.69]I've got item burden 157.
[203:20.57]Let me just see what else I can pick up now.
[203:24.64]Gauntlets.
[203:26.56]His shit is so heavy.
[203:28.60]He has the heaviest shit, man.
[203:37.29]Fuck, all of his stuff is so heavy.
[203:44.82]Tower shield is 30.
[203:45.74]I'm definitely not going to use the tower shield.
[203:49.02]That's for sure.
[203:50.40]I'm just going to throw that on the ground.
[203:53.62]Jesus, man.
[203:55.50]Yeah, I'm not going to use this.
[204:01.89]Get rid of it.
[204:05.33]I'm not going to use that shit.
[204:07.65]Alright, this is armor.
[204:10.43]Let me just at least...
[204:16.94]Because I'm going back right now.
[204:19.08]Can I pick anything else up that won't overburden me?
[204:20.70]I can get like these... I don't even know why I pick up this dumb slave shield.
[204:23.50]I killed him for nothing.
[204:27.00]I got his ring.
[204:27.74]I got the strength ring.
[204:30.68]Silver demon soul.
[204:31.78]Alright, let's go back.
[204:34.63]Kill him and then dump his armor.
[204:35.93]I didn't know that guy was that important.
[204:40.56]Let me give you, like, an example.
[204:41.74]You know when, like, you get a summons in the other games?
[204:45.41]Well, like, for instance, like, Bloodborne.
[204:48.01]The guy that just, like, helps you, the summons.
[204:51.35]I don't know.
[204:51.69]I didn't know that guy was, like, the most important character in the game.
[205:13.22]How was I supposed to know that he was like... I opened up that guy's cell.
[205:17.92]And he went, I'm sleepy.
[205:20.72]And so I accidentally killed him.
[205:22.60]How am I supposed to know that he's the most important person?
[205:24.74]How could you do that?
[205:26.48]How could you kill that guy not knowing anything about the game and that's the first time you've ever seen this guy?
[205:31.20]I don't know.
[205:31.86]How was I supposed to fucking know?
[205:39.33]I don't need that guy.
[205:42.35]I got what I wanted from him.
[205:45.59]Alright.
[205:51.64]How much better is this thing?
[205:53.00]This thing's crazy.
[205:53.82]What is this?
[205:54.40]What is this?
[205:58.16]500 durability?
[205:58.74]That's what it is?
[206:01.82]Damage reduction.
[206:04.37]100%.
[206:04.47]This is actually really good.
[206:07.57]This thing regens, but... Good at fending off flames.
[206:15.86]It's really heavy, though.
[206:22.35]I got that shield from murdering that man.
[206:26.45]Look at this thing.
[206:28.65]Nice.
[206:29.57]Can't wait to try that on.
[206:30.43]Let's deposit this helmet.
[206:37.76]I'm not going to be able to wear this shit.
[206:39.50]It's way too heavy.
[206:47.51]I mean, he's important enough to give you the bad ending if he dies.
[206:52.85]Well, who cares about... It's the journey that matters, not where we end up.
[206:57.35]It's where we are.
[207:03.15]I'm gonna keep these legs.
[207:05.28]I'm gonna wear them.
[207:10.22]What can I wear?
[207:12.46]Equipment-wise.
[207:17.91]Where am I at for burden right now?
[207:19.23]36 out of 53.
[207:19.87]Nope.
[207:20.01]Put on your gun.
[207:28.24]Don't have anything else I can do here, huh?
[207:30.94]25.
[207:30.98]I mean, I'm okay with... I can do this.
[207:36.20]Maybe eventually I can.
[207:37.14]I have a legendary soldier's soul.
[207:43.39]Use it.
[207:43.65]I'm gonna put his ring on.
[207:49.24]That's true.
[207:49.70]What have I got here?
[207:52.81]Stupid fucking cling ring.
[207:58.17]Clap a rat ring.
[208:01.41]Ring of great strength.
[208:05.16]Wow, okay.
[208:06.18]Now that's... Alright.
[208:09.18]Let's do it.
[208:09.66]Let's put this shit on then.
[208:13.22]That's a lot.
[208:18.73]Let's put on... Can I put the armor on too?
[208:22.57]I don't think I can.
[208:25.81]We are... I might be able to do it.
[208:28.81]Maybe.
[208:34.24]No.
[208:34.98]Nope, still fat rolling.
[208:35.90]70, like 80.
[208:39.68]I need to get that down to like 40.
[208:40.96]Fuck.
[208:41.32]Oh well.
[208:44.68]Oh well.
[208:45.82]What is it at now?
[208:46.30]36? 36?
[208:52.37]Full brushwood?
[208:53.15]I mean, probably eventually.
[208:55.09]But I'm gonna have to deal with the legs now.
[208:57.29]What about the helmet?
[208:57.89]How much is the helmet?
[209:01.17]36.
[209:01.29]Is the helmet more than, like, 5?
[209:02.35]No, the fluted helmet is 4.
[209:12.92]We are...
[209:20.77]Six.
[209:22.69]No.
[209:23.15]It's not gonna work.
[209:25.33]Will this work?
[209:27.69]Shit.
[209:28.29]Just barely.
[209:29.27]When I level up, I'm gonna level up Endurance.
[209:32.46]It'll be fine.
[209:34.22]Don't you dare take that hat off.
[209:35.66]I did.
[209:35.98]I'm sorry.
[209:37.14]Here we go.
[209:50.25]Now I'm good.
[209:53.35]Should be good even if I put on the other one, right?
[209:58.37]42, 81, not quite.
[209:58.95]But I'm okay.
[210:00.73]Let's buy some half-moon grass.
[210:06.97]Kill patches, you're already killing people for no reason.
[210:10.92]What's with this kill people for no reason thing?
[210:13.06]No.
[210:13.82]I killed one NPC.
[210:16.52]Because I didn't think he was an important NPC.
[210:18.94]I thought he was just a guy that I opened up from a cell.
[210:23.76]Patches gets to stay because Patches has cheap moon grass.
[210:30.28]I have plenty of reasons to kill Patches.
[210:34.81]Alright, well that's done.
[210:39.64]Kill the maiden.
[210:40.30]I'm not going to kill the maiden.
[210:41.54]We don't kill people for no reason.
[210:42.98]Alright, where are we off to now?
[210:52.12]3-2?
[211:00.29]Streamer's chills for the patches.
[211:03.19]There's no penalty for killing her.
[211:04.45]No, no, no.
[211:06.29]I'm going to go 3-2.
[211:13.28]uh what's my item burden right now maybe I should put some more stuff in the one person we say to kill he won't kill the one we don't want him to kill he kills right away I did ah
[211:34.56]Come on.
[211:36.52]The one fucking guy that I end up killing that's an NPC, the one guy that I choose in this whole playthrough happens to be that guy.
[211:43.90]It was roll the dice if that was going to happen.
[211:47.24]And it's okay because I got a strength ring.
[211:48.74]I got like 25 equipment burden for free.
[211:59.62]Look, don't, it's not a big deal.
[212:02.12]It might be, it might be a big deal.
[212:03.58]And look at, what's with this item burden?
[212:05.03]What do I have?
[212:06.29]How much shit do I have in here?
[212:11.69]What do I have that's so heavy that I'm still carrying?
[212:14.79]Oh, god fucking damn it.
[212:16.69]Oh, come on.
[212:17.69]Of course.
[212:18.29]God damn it.
[212:31.41]Singular point.
[212:39.14]Guilt is weighing me down.
[212:41.34]Well, it is!
[212:42.08]Because it's too late.
[212:45.96]Hello.
[212:46.33]It's absolutely weighing me down.
[212:48.81]My first time streaming.
[212:57.35]Okay.
[213:01.06]Um... There we go.
[213:04.16]I am holding on to this just in case I need to use it.
[213:05.92]I need to go upgrade shit too.
[213:07.58]I'll do that after.
[213:11.00]Kill him too.
[213:12.21]No.
[213:18.59]No, that's for... There it is.
[213:22.45]Watch out.
[213:23.97]Hey guys, I had my blood taken out earlier.
[213:40.29]I had, like, blood taken out.
[213:43.65]3-2.
[213:46.83]I see a gargoyle over there.
[213:47.91]That means danger coming up.
[213:55.68]Uh, danger.
[213:57.96]Nothing over there.
[214:00.16]That's not something I should be doing.
[214:01.30]I shouldn't be rolling on these platforms.
[214:04.32]Okay, what about right there?
[214:07.36]Item and a free gargoyle.
[214:08.74]He's gonna come down.
[214:09.38]He's gonna swoop down.
[214:10.12]He's gonna say like... Where is he?
[214:15.39]No.
[214:15.45]Can I drop?
[214:17.01]No.
[214:22.21]Enemic streamer.
[214:23.71]Murders local hero.
[214:27.20]I fucking praise the sun, right?
[214:33.54]You didn't say anything.
[214:34.90]I'm just a statue.
[214:39.18]This is Super Mario RPG.
[214:41.40]Legend of the Seven Stars.
[214:44.28]Oh, hi.
[214:46.92]He ain't that bright, are he?
[214:51.08]He might be.
[214:53.02]Get off me.
[214:55.97]Get... Fresh spices.
[215:09.55]Not a backstab.
[215:14.51]It's alright.
[215:19.62]This one was friendly.
[215:20.62]Alright, no more of this shit.
[215:24.14]No more of this bullshit.
[215:26.94]Now everybody I kill, everyone's gonna freak out and be like, why did you do that?
[215:30.38]He was the most important NPC of the whole series.
[215:41.22]I'm like, this guy's freaking me out.
[215:42.34]I don't like that guy being there.
[215:49.98]No rolling here.
[215:53.03]Absolutely no rolling.
[216:10.97]I have his ring, so who cares?
[216:14.29]Yeah, like, I... Look, if I did this entire quest, I would have gotten the ring anyway.
[216:21.58]I got what I wanted.
[216:22.40]I got what I came for.
[216:23.38]So what's the big deal?
[216:27.63]Everyone's freaking out for no reason.
[216:33.33]So I'm gonna get the bad ending.
[216:34.59]I get the bad ending in every single one of these games that I play.
[216:40.89]And, oh, heaven forbid, guys.
[216:43.19]Heaven forbid I get the one of two endings in all these Souls games.
[216:48.85]So, sorry, you're not going to get to see, like, the nine-second cutscene that you wanted to watch at the end.
[216:53.12]Come on.
[216:55.92]This isn't, like, this isn't a telltale game.
[217:06.17]The lady's going to be like,
[217:08.74]You didn't extinguish the flame.
[217:11.84]Now the world is in darkness.
[217:13.64]And then we're gonna get a nine second cutscene, and the game ends.
[217:20.72]Who really cares?
[217:21.98]It's about the journey, not the ending.
[217:29.58]The game just crashes when you win.
[217:36.81]It isn't a telltale game, because your choice is bad.
[217:39.09]Yeah, you know, alright, I'll take that.
[217:41.08]I'll take that.
[217:48.28]Telltale game.
[217:53.01]Yeah, it's either Kenny says, HEY!
[217:56.67]Or Kenny says, YO!
[217:59.41]Either one.
[218:02.21]Come on, fly down here.
[218:07.53]Kenny will remember that.
[218:11.31]And by Kenny will remember that, it's gonna be on the previously on The Walking Dead.
[218:16.62]It's the game remembering that.
[218:21.04]Previously on The Walking Dead.
[218:22.42]You know, when you said that before, that wasn't cool.
[218:25.11]That's it.
[218:31.49]I want this guy to land.
[218:32.97]There he goes.
[218:33.37]Come on.
[218:34.41]Get over here.
[218:35.59]Stop this.
[218:36.13]He has a bow.
[218:37.23]You got a crossbow.
[218:37.82]That's not fair.
[218:38.36]Land.
[218:39.92]Land.
[218:41.98]Land, damn you.
[218:42.98]Land.
[218:43.34]Land.
[219:01.49]I don't like this place.
[219:02.37]It's too dark.
[219:03.65]It's too dark in here.
[219:08.95]Yeah, Kenny will remember that.
[219:21.26]The game's gonna remember that.
[219:48.35]Fuck.
[219:54.67]It's a little dark down here.
[219:57.19]Okay, don't do that again.
[219:59.84]So what did I do here?
[220:00.84]What happened here?
[220:02.00]It's not this way.
[220:11.67]Here it is.
[220:12.21]Here it is.
[220:12.67]Okay.
[220:13.07]I got it.
[220:13.53]I got it.
[220:13.95]Oh, my fucking head hurts.
[220:15.91]God damn it, man.
[220:17.47]No.
[220:17.89]I just don't know what would happen if I let Biore live.
[220:24.72]Yeah, Biore, why don't you sell me a face wash, dickhead?
[220:28.30]No, that's too bad you can't.
[220:29.68]You're fucking buried six feet under the dust.
[220:34.44]Praise the sun?
[220:35.78]Yeah.
[220:36.84]You ain't praising the sun when you're buried in the fucking dirt.
[220:42.33]I don't have any remorse for you, Biore.
[220:51.11]Everybody thought that was a mistake.
[220:52.63]I did it on purpose.
[220:58.00]I knew how much of a fan favorite he was.
[221:01.56]Just call me George RRR Mountain.
[221:12.84]This place is pretty eerie, though.
[221:15.80]Local psychopath streams demon sounds.
[221:18.38]Yeah.
[221:23.18]Kinda.
[221:23.42]Kinda.
[221:27.38]Well, I went up this time instead of down that way, so I guess we're just gonna explore this way.
[221:31.80]We're gonna get to the boss.
[221:41.39]Uh...
[221:44.93]Why is there... ...giant... ...prang from Ninja Turtles here?
[221:56.56]Holy shit.
[222:01.80]Good thing they never fixed this problem.
[222:15.27]I don't think I'm ever going to kill you.
[222:22.63]I thought I was going off the edge there, and I was about to be very upset.
[222:26.80]This thing is too slow to kill him.
[222:28.08]I just have to go.
[222:34.60]Disable that noise.
[222:35.64]It's making me scared.
[222:37.22]Is this the boss?
[222:40.43]Is it really just right here?
[222:42.91]No, it can't be.
[222:43.55]I've got to be careful, because I want...
[222:51.31]Why am I trying?
[222:51.89]That guy can fly.
[222:52.97]Doesn't matter if you knock him off the cliff.
[222:55.74]The guy can fly.
[222:56.66]Let me push him off.
[222:58.98]That'll be great.
[223:00.65]Well, now they're all leaving.
[223:01.59]Whatever.
[223:01.91]That gives me a chance.
[223:30.66]How are you supposed to get that?
[223:31.54]How are you supposed to get that?
[223:35.14]I don't... No, I did this before.
[223:38.70]Hold on.
[223:40.42]You can't, like, hug that wall.
[223:42.74]Apparently not.
[223:47.98]Okay.
[223:54.27]I've died more to the cliffs than the actual enemies.
[223:56.15]That's probably true.
[223:57.89]Go through the fog first?
[223:58.91]Well, I can't... I don't know.
[224:00.65]I've been able to do that before.
[224:01.65]Let's go up.
[224:10.12]I had collision with the fog door.
[224:11.50]Well, I mean, that doesn't mean the lip can't come out.
[224:24.94]Fog pushed me off.
[224:29.43]What a dick.
[224:32.49]Yeah, there's the guy with the crossbow.
[224:33.91]I remember you.
[224:36.07]That's fine.
[224:36.55]And for some reason now you're not in the air.
[224:37.95]There's an item right there.
[224:40.89]Can I get this?
[224:41.37]As long as I'm, like, not stupid.
[224:45.39]Flame Burge!
[224:48.67]Cool.
[224:49.95]Oh, no.
[224:50.29]How do I get back over there?
[224:52.95]Oh, shit.
[224:55.84]I don't think I can get up there.
[224:57.26]I don't think I can do that.
[224:58.62]Can I make that?
[225:00.30]I'm not sure I can walk over there.
[225:05.27]Can I?
[225:05.57]I mean, I came down on it, but can I go over on it?
[225:08.79]Can I walk on that?
[225:10.87]Whatever.
[225:12.33]Get out of the way.
[225:14.01]Please, just move out of the way.
[225:18.33]Woo!
[225:18.85]Okay.
[225:26.54]I don't even know why I picked that up.
[225:27.51]There's nothing on it.
[225:28.15]Okay.
[225:38.75]So, wait.
[225:39.10]Now can I do this?
[225:39.96]I wish I could.
[225:42.88]Just get out of the way.
[225:43.64]I need to be able to look and see if I can do this.
[225:52.19]Right there.
[225:52.59]Okay.
[225:55.88]This guy's gonna fuck this up so bad.
[226:00.22]You're going to make this awful for me.
[226:01.78]No, I'm gonna get shot with an arrow.
[226:03.60]And I'm gonna fall.
[226:11.41]That's how this is gonna go down.
[226:14.65]Can I do this?
[226:18.61]I don't think I can do this.
[226:21.41]Wait, get out of here.
[226:22.47]What are you doing over here?
[226:27.11]He's trying to get the item too.
[226:28.23]He's being as timid as me.
[226:32.02]Wow.
[226:35.18]Pull him in here.
[226:41.04]If I didn't bump into him right there, if I didn't hit the wall, I would have gone off the edge.
[226:47.51]Okay.
[226:48.27]Got it.
[226:54.37]For an Old Spice.
[226:57.25]It was so not worth it.
[226:58.69]At all.
[227:01.47]Whatever.
[227:01.97]Let's go.
[227:08.24]Going up.
[227:08.64]I don't like this.
[227:18.72]Too many cliffs here.
[227:19.54]I don't like this.
[227:20.17]I'm like the... I can't do cliffs in these games.
[227:22.55]Oh.
[227:25.45]Not when they're this easy to fall off.
[227:27.93]I'm going to fall again.
[227:29.31]And everybody's going to laugh about it.
[227:31.89]If I wasn't streaming this game, I would be just so embarrassed.
[227:35.39]But I would be so glad that no one was watching.
[227:38.13]See?
[227:39.43]Look.
[227:40.96]Oh.
[227:43.16]Okay, well, that's fine.
[227:44.94]I'm okay with that.
[227:45.58]You know what I mean?
[227:50.72]I'd be like, oh, thank God no one is watching this right now.
[228:00.27]But that's what happens when you stream yourself playing video games blind and you've never played it before.
[228:04.13]That's when you put yourself up to these things.
[228:12.98]Renown soul.
[228:23.58]Alright, I just stopped the people from praying and now...
[228:30.19]Chain fell.
[228:35.84]Oh, that was the... That was the... That was the sloppy guy.
[228:41.72]Okay.
[228:45.36]I got one chain off the sloppy guy.
[228:47.06]That really is just the thing from Bloodborne.
[228:48.52]It's like the brain thing from Bloodborne.
[228:50.37]I love how slow this thing is.
[228:56.95]It really is just so slow.
[229:01.60]Okay, easy now.
[229:03.65]This is a place where I can get pushed.
[229:05.19]I know it's gonna happen.
[229:07.21]That's where it was.
[229:08.09]Anything up here?
[229:08.79]No.
[229:12.11]Nothing even over there.
[229:12.83]What about that way?
[229:17.10]Okay.
[229:20.92]Well, I'm gonna assume there's another one, so I got one.
[229:22.78]I guess I have to go on the other side?
[229:34.84]Let's see.
[229:36.18]I wish I could see better.
[229:38.10]What is that over there?
[229:45.21]I like this area.
[229:45.83]Really cool area, though.
[229:46.97]I like this place.
[229:48.93]For as terrible as I am.
[229:50.27]This just is Bloodborne.
[229:51.83]Look at these things.
[229:52.87]These are the elevators from Bloodborne.
[229:54.27]You step inside and they go down.
[229:56.81]They close.
[229:57.38]Remember that?
[230:29.59]I don't know if I want to be in here right now.
[230:34.42]No, I don't know if I want to do this right now.
[230:42.04]I don't like this.
[230:44.78]Is this thing going to stay here?
[230:46.10]So I can get up, I can leave if I want to, if I get too scared?
[230:56.03]This is not a poison swamp, is it?
[230:58.36]This place is dark as shit too.
[231:03.57]I can't even see 10 feet in front of my fucking face.
[231:15.47]These things are not alive.
[231:20.04]Fragrant ring.
[231:27.85]Uh, what is that?
[231:34.51]Cover MP.
[231:35.44]No.
[231:35.76]God.
[231:41.08]Fuck this haunted house.
[231:42.78]That just scared the shit out of me because it was so dark I didn't even know it was there.
[232:05.52]Fuck.
[232:07.00]I don't like this place.
[232:10.11]Okay, I gotta concentrate here.
[232:11.33]Because I need to get, like, up there.
[232:12.97]It's the spider people from Bloodborne.
[232:18.69]Look at all these Bloodborne enemies.
[232:25.24]Okay.
[232:32.33]I'm just gonna run around in a circle over here.
[232:37.96]Because I didn't go this way.
[232:43.64]Oh no, it's just one of those things.
[232:44.63]It's one of these stupid things.
[233:17.83]Gonna do this flailing arms thing.
[233:23.99]I think I can kill before he kills me.
[233:26.33]Here we go.
[233:26.65]Ready?
[233:27.71]Say your prayer.
[233:28.99]No, don't say your prayers.
[233:30.45]I'm not gonna do that.
[233:36.03]Come on.
[233:36.27]Am I not far away enough for you to shoot me at the range?
[233:46.52]Shard of Mercury Stone.
[233:47.66]Shard of Mercury Stone.
[233:50.42]I hate this place.
[234:02.38]Shard of Mercury Stone.
[234:03.50]Okay, there's a way up.
[234:11.10]I see a way up.
[234:14.34]Right?
[234:14.70]I see torches, at least.
[234:19.36]Oh, I already went this way.
[234:20.58]That's the elevator to go back up there.
[234:24.38]There's gotta be something here, right?
[234:28.90]That thing is giant.
[234:30.08]Good thing it doesn't see me yet.
[234:41.43]What did it do?
[234:42.33]What's it doing?
[234:42.91]Why is it taking so long to die?
[234:44.63]It's doing something really strange.
[234:52.64]Turn the brightness on.
[234:53.52]It is.
[234:54.38]This is just the area.
[234:55.22]It's just crazy dark.
[235:05.45]That really does look like the thing.
[235:06.49]You're right.
[235:07.85]Alright, here's a way up.
[235:11.51]Shit.
[235:22.55]It's a very long death animation.
[235:30.28]I'm really glad that these guys are not that dangerous.
[235:33.84]I'd be very, very sad if they were.
[235:44.33]That's a frame rate I don't like to have.
[235:46.57]Can I get my frame rate back, please?
[235:52.27]Thank you.
[235:52.65]Guidance stones.
[235:58.53]Hmm.
[236:03.21]Okay, I'm gonna go up.
[236:11.52]May I please have my frames back?
[236:14.84]Should I complain some more or what do you think?
[236:27.11]Bug on the wall?
[236:27.71]No.
[236:35.24]I don't like this at all.
[236:36.42]I really don't like it.
[236:38.08]What is this?
[236:38.52]This is another one?
[236:39.71]Another elevator?
[236:40.35]Jesus Christ.
[236:52.23]Okay, he's like a scorpion.
[236:54.57]Oh, you fucking dick.
[236:56.19]I just got up there.
[236:56.99]I don't even know how to get back.
[236:57.89]He burped at me.
[237:00.74]Oh my god, come on.
[237:04.56]Oh, shit.
[237:08.28]Can I walk up this guy's leg?
[237:10.65]Whatever the hell this is.
[237:15.59]I guess so.
[237:20.76]I don't know if this does anything for me.
[237:27.69]What is this doing for me?
[237:30.29]There's a fog gate right there.
[237:32.81]Is a boss down here too?
[237:56.48]That's wonderful.
[238:00.67]There's no reason.
[238:01.67]They only put that there.
[238:04.13]To fuck with you.
[238:04.77]And you know what?
[238:05.25]That's fine.
[238:07.77]They only put that there to make you fucking angry.
[238:12.93]That's the only reason.
[238:14.87]And you know what?
[238:15.46]I accept it.
[238:16.30]I accept my fate there.
[238:20.39]But there is a boss down there, so I want to go do that.
[238:28.73]That's a long way away, isn't it?
[238:30.59]Not really.
[238:32.63]It's long enough.
[238:34.69]Long enough.
[238:39.68]It's just another Bed of Chaos.
[238:41.42]I wouldn't be surprised.
[238:46.16]But good luck having me find where that fog gate is again.
[238:53.77]We all float down here, Georgie.
[238:55.93]I don't know if anybody's said this yet, but if you've seen the new It, I liked it.
[239:02.09]It was pretty good.
[239:03.41]The only problem that I have, it's not really a problem.
[239:07.87]Pennywise sounds like Scooby-Doo.
[239:10.61]He's like, oh, we all float down here, George.
[239:15.36]Raggedy.
[239:16.86]I couldn't take it seriously.
[239:17.78]It was making me laugh, but not in the way that it should have.
[239:32.03]Every time he would talk, it's just like, well, Georgie, you're like me, Scooby-Doo.
[239:43.08]Also, I know they're making another movie with the, like, you know, the adults, but... I was about to quit the game.
[239:51.36]I was about to quit the game.
[239:54.89]I was about to quit the game.
[239:56.69]Good thing, because I was about to quit the game at end screen.
[240:06.57]We're good.
[240:07.13]We're good.
[240:07.61]But wait.
[240:08.09]But what am I doing?
[240:08.89]I need the elevator.
[240:10.03]No, I don't.
[240:10.43]Yes, I do.
[240:12.71]Do I?
[240:15.58]Delete the Twitch account.
[240:17.38]My twitch.tv account.
[240:19.54]It's going.
[240:20.28]It's going.
[240:21.64]There's a way to go down, right?
[240:24.26]From here.
[240:30.15]I'd be making the same mistakes.
[240:31.81]Everybody does.
[240:33.97]Pretty much everybody does.
[240:37.50]I already looked over there.
[240:43.48]Where did I try to... I went somewhere from here.
[240:45.60]Where the fuck did I go from here?
[240:47.72]Oh, right here.
[240:50.65]And then I went in one of these things, the one over here.
[240:53.09]Are there two of these?
[240:56.63]Where does this one go?
[241:00.03]It really is just like pick your poison, huh?
[241:02.21]Like, where does this one go?
[241:22.35]I guess this is just another version of the same thing.
[241:34.84]Let's just walk in and die to the boss.
[241:37.08]Might as well, right?
[241:37.72]That's what's gonna happen.
[241:40.90]Everybody's gonna get their fucking Kappas ready.
[241:44.60]Gonna be like, he died!
[241:46.00]Spam it!
[241:52.94]It was every emote in a Jupiter.
[241:54.38]Something really creative with the Jupiters, guys.
[241:57.36]Doesn't surprise me.
[242:00.96]Doesn't surprise me at all.
[242:04.75]Watch out for the skinless elephant trunk.
[242:08.63]I remember this.
[242:10.39]I remember going, oh, he didn't see me.
[242:11.97]Oh, he saw me.
[242:16.27]That was not the time.
[242:18.79]Apparently I hit him.
[242:25.02]Keep going over here.
[242:25.86]It was on the ground, though.
[242:26.76]It was on ground level.
[242:30.80]Wasn't it?
[242:31.08]It was, like, over this way.
[242:34.04]No, I don't even want to... I don't want to fight you.
[242:36.55]Don't make me do this.
[242:39.03]Don't... Don't make me do this.
[242:40.83]Don't make me do this shit.
[242:42.03]Don't make me die here, either.
[242:43.13]Don't let me fucking die here.
[242:45.13]In this darkness.
[242:45.93]Don't let me die in darkness.
[242:51.12]There's another one right next to me.
[242:52.46]And there's another one right there, too.
[242:53.40]There's a little baby one.
[242:56.21]That's fine.
[243:00.41]Jesus.
[243:05.01]Okay.
[243:06.79]Now, where was that?
[243:08.71]I had to walk down this thing.
[243:11.91]I gotta one-shot this boss, because I really don't want to come back down here.
[243:14.23]This place sucks.
[243:18.49]I'm gonna go for a one-and-done on this boss.
[243:24.59]I'm not remembering where the hell that is.
[243:30.73]This way.
[243:33.27]Up another one and then around.
[243:34.52]Okay, there's the death trap that I stepped on.
[243:37.08]It's over here.
[243:38.34]No, no, no, no.
[243:57.97]Ring of disease resistance.
[243:59.57]Maybe I should put it on.
[244:00.45]Where's that fog gate?
[244:10.45]Can this man be the second hardest boss in the game first try?
[244:16.27]That's what this is?
[244:17.43]What is over there?
[244:20.21]You see that, right?
[244:20.87]What's that?
[244:24.31]Is that an item I didn't get?
[244:26.93]Yeah, it is.
[244:30.56]Okay.
[244:40.69]This place just... Aye, aye, aye.
[244:47.31]I was, like, kind of going the right way, too.
[244:48.75]I just don't know.
[244:52.69]This whole level is just a blur.
[244:59.21]There it is.
[244:59.57]I need to get up there.
[245:13.18]Come on.
[245:15.68]Let's go.
[245:21.33]Feels like a maze.
[245:23.53]Oh, I just gotta remember where the hell to go.
[245:26.01]Like, I need to go up.
[245:27.87]And apparently around.
[245:28.83]I think.
[245:32.51]Yeah.
[245:35.37]Right?
[245:36.17]No?
[245:39.19]Fuck.
[245:44.49]Oh, this is gonna melt my brain.
[245:46.13]Ugh.
[245:53.21]It's that way and there's one other way.
[245:54.37]I can go across here.
[245:56.15]So it's straight across this next time.
[245:58.19]I won't fall down that.
[246:11.08]Straight around.
[246:12.18]Okay.
[246:15.92]I found it.
[246:17.74]Now I gotta go up.
[246:24.74]And then around.
[246:26.19]And then up again.
[246:32.53]Climb the tentacle.
[246:34.45]Last time I climbed the tentacle, very bad things happened to me.
[246:39.08]I'm gonna refrain from that for now.
[246:44.22]Don't fucking dodge.
[246:46.90]If I gotta take damage, take the damage.
[246:52.89]Okay.
[246:53.49]So, I have a disease ring.
[246:54.75]I wonder if I should put it on.
[246:55.61]There is some stuff.
[247:06.19]Soldier's soul.
[247:09.35]Dark moon grass.
[247:13.07]Hmm.
[247:16.47]Hmm.
[247:17.41]Okay.
[247:20.63]I wish I was...
[247:21.67]I wish I was whole.
[247:22.55]Uh, oh, I'm just gonna go in.
[247:30.66]Let's, you know... I have no idea what the hell's in here.
[247:33.62]Uh, apparently nothing.
[247:41.12]Yet.
[247:45.39]I guess it's nothing yet.
[247:47.13]Maybe.
[247:47.35]Maybe.
[247:53.47]Hmm.
[247:54.51]Wait, was it?
[247:56.73]It wasn't already here, was it?
[248:01.35]Okay, there's... I gotta... Alright, do I have to climb this one, actually?
[248:04.59]Do I actually have to climb you?
[248:07.10]No, you're just there... You're there for atmosphere, and while there... There sure is.
[248:15.58]There's a body lying here, so I can walk this way, but I don't...
[248:22.86]There's got to be a better way to get here, right?
[248:26.37]I would assume there has to be an easier way to get here.
[248:29.13]Oh, fuck you.
[248:30.15]It's one of those guys.
[248:31.27]Is that an invader?
[248:35.75]React.
[248:36.23]Do it.
[248:36.49]Get him before he can do anything.
[248:47.79]Nothing over here?
[248:52.14]I'm so nervous.
[248:52.98]I really am.
[249:00.14]What's the ?
[249:00.68]Ah.
[249:14.99]There's got to be a faster way to get over here.
[249:17.22]One of those other little elevators.
[249:18.68]I'm going to pull the other elevator up.
[249:21.60]That's what's going to happen.
[249:22.52]There's going to be another elevator here that I go up.
[249:25.64]And that's the one on the left.
[249:27.92]The one that's down.
[249:29.28]I hope.
[249:33.12]That's potentially very incorrect.
[249:41.11]This is posing a problem.
[249:42.45]No, it's not.
[249:44.64]Cookie bug.
[249:45.28]Get it.
[249:45.48]It's gone.
[249:49.18]Forget it.
[249:49.50]Forget it.
[249:49.98]Forget it.
[249:54.24]Alright.
[249:58.77]How much further is it?
[250:00.93]Wait.
[250:02.51]Okay.
[250:06.01]Wait.
[250:09.51]Am I supposed to go down that way?
[250:10.79]I don't think I can go over here.
[250:15.14]Oh, there's a place to go this way.
[250:25.07]Bait him out one by one.
[250:26.03]I ain't getting knocked off this ledge.
[250:27.59]I'm too far over here.
[250:31.83]Where are you?
[250:32.47]Are you flying above me?
[250:35.97]Get this... I want it to lock on, but you know, it's okay.
[250:39.02]Just bring him back here.
[250:43.65]Thought I blocked that, apparently I didn't.
[250:47.99]Oh, fuck me in my face!
[250:52.97]I thought he was gonna lunge.
[250:54.89]Ugh, I'm fine.
[250:57.83]Back to our regularly scheduled programming.
[251:01.35]Slaying demons, you know?
[251:19.24]Another guy coming down.
[251:20.50]Let's get a bow.
[251:22.44]Get inside.
[251:24.40]Or don't get inside.
[251:26.42]What is that?
[251:28.62]All your training.
[251:29.92]All of your training, man.
[251:33.79]I hear another elevator.
[251:34.81]Okay, this is where you chop the other guy's leg off.
[251:36.97]Don't die here because of this guy.
[251:40.19]Do not blow this whole thing.
[251:42.47]It's very tempting to because he's in a spot that's hard to see.
[251:46.02]Don't blow it.
[251:46.82]Let him land and hit him.
[251:55.05]Okay.
[251:59.62]There's stuff here.
[252:00.90]Let me look over here.
[252:03.96]Is there a hole there?
[252:05.00]No holes.
[252:06.86]I do see... I do see this though.
[252:14.00]I do see it.
[252:15.22]Where was it?
[252:20.11]It's kind of like burnt.
[252:22.53]Didn't I just see one of those things?
[252:26.07]I guess I didn't.
[252:26.97]Okay.
[252:27.33]Well, whatever.
[252:31.72]Come on.
[252:33.04]Give me the elevator.
[252:37.20]I don't like this elevator.
[252:38.48]It doesn't stop.
[252:39.12]It stops like... And there's a way to die.
[252:41.91]There's a way to get in there.
[252:43.23]I saw it.
[252:45.07]I'm not gonna do it yet.
[252:45.83]Why is it so huge?
[252:53.80]Wait a minute.
[252:54.34]Just hold on.
[252:55.98]There was a place to dive in here.
[253:00.26]I'm gonna go.
[253:00.72]I'm gonna do it.
[253:01.24]It's right... It's just the bottom of the elevator.
[253:20.45]That was just the end.
[253:21.57]That was the end of the ride.
[253:22.79]Get off.
[253:30.80]Look, it's so nerve-wracking being out this far and being that close to an objective.
[253:38.99]End of the stream?
[253:39.73]What?
[253:40.03]No, I'm still here.
[253:40.93]What?
[253:41.11]I'm not ending the stream.
[253:46.87]Just let him... I don't know what to do about this.
[253:49.98]I can't swing because I'm going to fall off the fucking ride.
[253:52.68]Get out of here.
[253:54.72]Why are you riding this?
[253:55.82]You can fly.
[253:57.32]You can fly.
[253:59.84]No, I don't want to ride it again.
[254:08.81]Looks like we're riding it again.
[254:09.75]I don't want to ride it again.
[254:16.41]Just get me off.
[254:17.61]Get me off it.
[254:19.37]Just get me out of here.
[254:21.65]This is the one that I get off.
[254:24.96]This is my stuff.
[254:28.24]It's the right side.
[254:29.16]Here it is.
[254:31.96]Okay.
[254:32.89]And here comes another guy.
[254:35.51]Are there two guys?
[254:36.33]Just get to a safe ground.
[254:39.05]Get to a safe place.
[254:39.83]I know I have to just chop off the stupid thing to make the chain drop.
[254:42.59]That's what I gotta do.
[254:43.21]It's right here.
[254:44.51]Just get rid of the worshippers and it'll happen.
[254:47.65]And then that's it.
[254:48.19]And then another door will open somewhere.
[254:58.31]here we go this place is huge that's why I'm so concerned I don't want to die here
[255:21.68]This is legitimately that part in Bloodborne again.
[255:33.13]What's that?
[255:38.39]Where is that?
[255:44.84]OK.
[255:44.96]I can go in there?
[255:52.67]I have to hold the same gesture for like 10 seconds.
[255:57.15]And then I get the best souls collection augmentation in the game.
[256:01.66]Right?
[256:01.78]Don't you get like the full moon ring?
[256:08.90]Well, let's go.
[256:13.73]At least I did that.
[256:14.61]Whatever it was.
[256:25.06]So should I just drop down?
[256:26.76]Just try to head back towards the middle?
[256:28.02]I assume, right?
[256:29.44]I guess that's what I'm doing.
[256:32.98]I'm gonna- I guess that's what I'm gonna do.
[256:34.47]This is the beginning.
[256:42.89]So now we go- both of you fuck off, both of you fuck off, please.
[256:46.10]I don't want anything to do with you two.
[256:55.72]Well, now I think this means that this place is unlocked now?
[257:04.53]No?
[257:07.17]Wait, what?
[257:08.99]Where did he fall?
[257:12.96]He didn't fall down there.
[257:13.94]He's like in the middle, right?
[257:18.70]Just make my way back to the middle?
[257:23.33]Yes?
[257:27.34]Why are they using stock dragon noises?
[257:29.68]Are they?
[257:31.50]Well, this is like 10 years ago, man.
[257:33.18]This is like PlayStation 3.
[257:44.30]No dodging.
[257:45.38]That's extremely important.
[257:48.56]Just use the shield, be a good boy.
[257:55.37]Fuck around.
[257:55.93]This is too dangerous to die here.
[257:58.53]Not gonna happen.
[258:01.55]Just land.
[258:03.97]Land!
[258:11.77]I do have a lot of those unknown hero souls, though.
[258:14.27]Wait, no.
[258:14.89]Keep the shield out.
[258:17.57]I'm gonna get collapsed on in a second.
[258:19.61]There was like 20 of those weird spider-faced people.
[258:24.64]So, it wouldn't surprise me if I got absolutely diarrhea'd on here.
[258:27.82]I'm gonna go back down.
[258:37.32]He's down there.
[258:38.20]Yeah, there he is.
[258:39.52]I can't really jump down there, huh?
[258:58.31]Don't dodge.
[258:59.45]I'm breaking my own rule.
[259:02.95]It's that way.
[259:15.33]Down and around.
[259:23.46]Oh, these little, little corridors.
[259:26.12]Yeah, come on over here.
[259:30.83]Yeah, you can tell your friend to come over here, too.
[259:35.71]Fuck.
[259:36.09]Don't blow it.
[259:36.85]Just stop blowing it.
[259:39.85]I know that you, like, like to do that, Jeremy, but no blowing it here.
[259:53.16]I think I got it before he fell off.
[260:01.64]It's so easy to fall.
[260:05.16]Where are my invisible walls?
[260:06.51]You know what I mean?
[260:11.43]Where are my invisible walls?
[260:14.63]So I can't fall off the game.
[260:16.97]This is a bad place.
[260:22.55]Don't want to fight anybody out here.
[260:24.01]Seriously.
[260:24.45]This is an awful, awful, awful, awful place to be.
[260:27.69]Like, this is so bad.
[260:28.85]Just quiet down, Jeremy.
[260:31.15]Quiet down.
[260:32.45]It's not a big deal.
[260:38.18]Okay, dead?
[260:40.90]I don't know.
[260:41.40]He does a bunch of movements, even when he dies.
[260:43.56]Gonna land behind me.
[260:46.66]That's fine.
[260:47.14]There's nobody behind me.
[260:52.63]This is the guy that was there.
[260:58.68]I have so many of those.
[260:59.42]Alright, here we are.
[261:08.79]No way to go down.
[261:09.47]This is just the way in.
[261:10.75]This is like his body, right?
[261:20.22]There were like three or four items.
[261:22.16]I'm gonna try to collect them.
[261:32.62]I'm gonna drop down into this guy's stomach region.
[261:41.53]A lot of these now.
[261:51.09]One more of you.
[261:52.05]A lot of free shit.
[261:55.32]I like it.
[262:01.65]There's a lot of items.
[262:03.93]This is Item City.
[262:06.63]Ring of Avarice.
[262:12.27]The Eevee.
[262:13.32]Goldmask and the Eevee.
[262:17.64]Got myself an Eevee.
[262:21.56]Let me see what these do.
[262:25.46]Obtain more souls when slaying enemies.
[262:26.90]That's great.
[262:33.20]Oh, look, another storied soul.
[262:34.52]Storied soul, I guess.
[262:35.62]Haven't seen another storied soul in a while.
[262:37.34]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[262:42.14]So what is the EP?
[262:46.52]It's a weapon favored by those of a vast society who meet in secret to discuss the harness of souls imbued with flame, which is one reason why these vicious people are so feared.
[262:55.75]So it's like a fire weapon.
[262:59.09]That's cool.
[263:01.09]Flame Burge is also...
[263:04.31]It's a large sword.
[263:05.41]Carving does a lot of bleeding.
[263:09.21]I forget sometimes that that is in this game.
[263:12.81]Because it's really easy to look over bleeding in every one of these games.
[263:20.55]Alright, so I've got a way to go up his ear.
[263:24.53]Inside of him.
[263:25.27]Is there a way to climb up?
[263:29.52]I don't think I can get up there.
[263:30.44]Maybe up there?
[263:34.22]Which part of this guy's body do I have to slide up?
[263:40.41]Looks like there was a place to drop down.
[263:45.99]I guess not.
[263:53.72]Okay.
[263:55.44]Well...
[264:01.43]Like right there, right?
[264:04.19]How do I get up there?
[264:11.03]Shit.
[264:12.41]How do I get there?
[264:14.11]I think I have to jump from somewhere.
[264:15.53]I gotta go back up.
[264:20.88]I believe there's nothing else I can do.
[264:25.36]Okay.
[264:25.52]Okay.
[264:29.12]Move, please.
[264:39.36]So wait, he was... Where did he fall from?
[264:45.28]Software.
[264:50.10]Oh, man.
[264:51.72]Oh, man!
[264:54.64]He was up there.
[264:55.48]I have to go higher up.
[265:06.35]Shit!
[265:10.71]Mmm, there we go.
[265:11.51]And then we're gonna give, like, a solid attempt on this boss.
[265:24.82]And then I'm going to... I'm gonna hit the hay.
[265:28.06]Hit that sack.
[265:28.68]You know.
[265:30.56]The sleep thing.
[265:31.30]So he was right there.
[265:36.95]Wasn't he... Remember I, like, freaked out and I looked back and I was like, Holy shit, what is that?
[265:47.66]There we go.
[265:48.32]Okay, so this is the way to go.
[265:49.30]Well, at least it's easy to get to wherever I'm going from here.
[265:54.98]I have a lot of stored souls.
[266:03.06]Let's go up.
[266:09.37]This is a super, super cool area.
[266:12.43]I do like this architecture.
[266:14.87]It fits really well with the theme of the video game.
[266:23.67]Don't don't don't freak out.
[266:24.95]I mean he's gonna grab you and he's gonna throw you but he's not gonna throw you down.
[266:28.60]Everything's fine.
[266:30.64]Just roll back.
[266:32.12]Only roll backwards.
[266:41.40]Now he's sprinting at you.
[266:42.25]Now he's sprinting at you.
[266:43.23]Now this is where you turn around and you run.
[266:48.61]He's still sprinting.
[266:49.99]Okay, we're okay.
[266:56.40]God damn it.
[266:57.30]Why does he have to be on these stairs?
[267:00.28]My fucking god.
[267:14.41]Yeah, I'm gonna say it.
[267:17.29]I don't think the bone... I don't think the dragon bone is a weapon to have.
[267:21.19]It does a lot of damage, but like, man, it takes so long to kill anybody.
[267:26.20]You have to... All these games, if you're talking about Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, it doesn't matter what fucking game you're playing, right?
[267:32.58]You gotta be able to move.
[267:33.74]And you gotta be able to swing fast and move fast.
[267:37.41]Going like this?
[267:38.05]That's not how you beat a Souls game.
[267:42.27]You're gonna die.
[267:46.99]I don't like to fucking dance around, you know what I mean?
[267:48.45]Like, I dance around.
[267:51.90]I don't like, I like to slow shit.
[267:53.22]I move around, I'm like quick.
[267:54.20]I'm fucking quick-witted, quick-minded.
[267:56.02]I gotta move.
[268:05.41]Level strength wants fast weapon.
[268:06.93]But I wanted to change it up.
[268:08.03]I do too many... I always do decks.
[268:11.60]Or sorcery.
[268:12.72]You guys watched me play Dark Souls 3 doing sorcery.
[268:17.06]Strictly sorcery.
[268:19.77]I only did magic.
[268:21.21]And that was fun.
[268:22.23]But I've never done like a straight up fat guy two-hander shithead build.
[268:27.05]In any of these games.
[268:29.15]And I want to try it.
[268:30.79]Probably not a good idea to do that when you do this blind.
[268:34.35]But we're going to kill this guy on the first swing.
[268:36.60]I'm just going to run at him.
[268:37.86]I'm going to make sure I have stamina.
[268:39.48]And I'm going to run into him.
[268:42.06]And smash him in the head.
[268:43.64]He's going to fucking cry.
[268:45.66]It's going to be bad.
[268:46.55]There's going to be blood.
[268:48.01]It's going to take like three crime scenes.
[268:51.23]Cleaners to clean this guy's fucking body after I'm done with it.
[269:04.57]That would have been much better wording.
[269:07.37]I would have had a lot of more well-rounded words and a completed thought there if he wasn't running at me like the ring lady.
[269:12.49]Alright, here we are.
[269:18.60]Come on.
[269:19.94]How high is this?
[269:26.40]If I were an item, I would be over here.
[269:29.84]That's right.
[269:31.47]I'd be hidden right here.
[269:36.92]Much better wording.
[269:42.65]Okay.
[269:45.97]We're up top.
[269:53.16]Oh, alright.
[269:55.60]Let me look over here.
[269:56.82]Grab some items.
[269:58.92]I got plenty of healing, so I could probably do a solid attempt.
[270:06.45]Mm-hmm.
[270:09.16]If I could sell this shit, I would.
[270:21.79]Alright, so I'm gonna tempt the boss.
[270:23.61]And then we're gonna get going.
[270:25.53]It depends on how addicted I am.
[270:26.93]We'll find out.
[270:29.37]The man-eater.
[270:33.63]Is the man-eater just a ghost?
[270:35.61]Okay, it's like a boogeyman.
[270:49.20]Easy.
[270:50.85]Where'd he go?
[270:53.07]Whoa!
[270:58.35]Where are you?
[270:59.53]There you are.
[271:00.09]Fuck.
[271:09.92]Come on.
[271:15.53]Okay, I'm gonna go up here.
[271:19.62]Is this a good place to go?
[271:20.66]Probably- Maybe.
[271:24.24]No.
[271:25.34]I can't even- Where the fuck is he?
[271:35.57]Fuck.
[271:43.99]Where'd you go?
[271:51.26]Good job with the fucking movement.
[272:01.83]There's two!
[272:09.63]There's two and one of them is a magician.
[272:24.09]No, there's fucking Old Spice and shit.
[272:25.71]Get out of my face.
[272:37.86]Well, I got wedged into that.
[272:40.62]I got stuck in there.
[272:45.15]All that, this is why that, I'm going to tell you why that happened.
[272:47.95]I have like fucking Old Spice equipped.
[272:52.49]Why?
[272:53.67]Why are there two old spices on my hotbar?
[272:56.75]Who put them there?
[272:58.07]I didn't put them there.
[273:00.82]Why are these here?
[273:02.74]Who fucking put these here?
[273:06.14]I did not.
[273:07.00]I did not put those there.
[273:12.38]Why would I fucking ever?
[273:13.52]Why would I ever in 500 million years put those on my hotbar?
[273:21.31]What in the name of God would those be there for?
[273:26.55]You gotta be shitting me.
[273:31.92]I didn't put those there.
[273:33.00]Why the fuck would they be there?
[273:34.62]Did it just auto put Old Spice in my fucking hotbar?
[273:40.83]I'm more angry at that I got look I got stuck in that corner between the two and that's fine But what you put old spice on my bar that I didn't put on there, and I have to scroll through fucking five items Eat shit, that's stupid Why would I put those there?
[274:03.28]I'm scrolling through because I thought I had Turpentine on my bar.
[274:05.74]No, you want Old Spice?
[274:06.78]Or do you want Old Spice Extreme?
[274:09.43]Clinical edition!
[274:23.64]That's so stupid.
[274:25.10]Look, I lost.
[274:26.56]And that's not why I'm angry.
[274:27.38]Because I took the extra, like, two, like, one second to be like, why do I have Old Spice?
[274:36.90]And guys, it only took them fucking 10 years to still have the worst inventory system in all of video games.
[274:45.21]It only took them like a decade. ...
[275:18.97]Fucking Old Spice, man.
[275:19.87]If I swear to God, like... I'm never buying Old Spice again.
[275:30.46]Yeah, guys.
[275:31.18]Make sure you buy Old Spice if you want to smell like fucking bleach and blue Kool-Aid.
[275:45.84]out of the way that's fucking bullshit man that guy turned his head his head knocked me off the edge
[276:09.61]Uh, you know, at least you can laugh about it a little bit, you know what I mean?
[276:13.44]It's alright.
[276:14.78]Fuck that.
[276:18.48]Oh, fuck this game.
[276:20.46]Fuck Old Spice.
[276:24.38]Fuck that stupid gargoyle.
[276:26.16]The gargoyle demons don't- No, it ain't gonna happen again.
[276:28.68]Because if I had walked by that, it wouldn't happen again.
[276:33.16]Yeah, your death animation is great.
[276:40.02]I hate that I have to kill this guy up here.
[276:41.58]That sucks.
[276:43.12]I'm going to take a humanity.
[276:45.59]I'm going to coat my weapon.
[276:47.49]Now I'm prepared for the two Bell Gargoyles.
[276:49.69]I'm ready.
[276:53.65]I just have to go up here.
[276:54.43]I have to run up the huge stairs and kill the stupid red invasion guy.
[277:08.70]I just gotta get up there quick and hit him.
[277:11.04]And if I get one hit on him, he's gonna die.
[277:15.39]I'm gonna put my weapon on fire, and I'm going to destroy these guys.
[277:20.58]Because I know I have to do it quick.
[277:23.94]That's what I needed to do.
[277:25.14]Oh, you fucking piece of crap.
[277:26.86]The sword is too slow for me to do this.
[277:30.85]For me to kill this fucking guy reliably.
[277:32.97]I need a weapon that's five times faster.
[277:34.55]Fall off!
[277:35.43]Do what I do!
[277:51.59]It's too slow for this spot This fucking weapon to kill that guy I'm putting on another weapon to kill that fucking guy because obviously this thing is too slow to swing what it's too slow to dodge and Swing one time at that guy That weapon I I don't like it.
[278:16.91]I don't want to use it because I can swing this fucking sword after I dodge I
[278:22.84]Holy shit.
[278:26.77]I'm rushing.
[278:27.45]It's gonna make me suffer every time.
[278:29.85]No, it's the fucking Old Spice, man.
[278:34.23]It's the goddamn Old Spice.
[278:35.57]Never let anybody tell you it was something else.
[278:39.03]I want you... Are you watching the VOD?
[278:40.27]Are you watching, like... Are you watching, like, the stream highlight of this playthrough?
[278:44.49]I want you to know something.
[278:45.43]Very important.
[278:47.42]It was the Old Spice.
[278:48.78]I never put it on.
[278:51.04]It just, it put itself on me.
[278:52.64]And you know, that reminds me.
[278:54.21]If you ever put Old Spice on, the deodorant, good luck getting it off.
[278:58.63]When you take a shower after using Old Spice, like antiperspirant, deodorant, it's like, it like hurts to wash under your arms.
[279:17.45]Okay, now don't fuck this up.
[279:19.99]Dive, and then hit him.
[279:21.67]That's all I have to do.
[279:23.55]Here he comes.
[279:24.63]There he is.
[279:25.67]There's that piece of fucking shit that they put on the stairway to make... Shut up.
[279:32.74]It didn't even matter.
[279:33.52]He didn't get staggered.
[279:37.98]Okay.
[279:46.83]Why am I not two-handing this, my friend?
[279:51.61]Don't kill me.
[279:58.11]What the fuck?
[280:01.30]No, no!
[280:02.44]I refuse!
[280:03.00]Okay, got old spies ahead of that.
[280:14.98]Okay, I have 36 light moon grass.
[280:19.43]Let's put on the dragon bone smasher.
[280:24.89]We're also going to take a human effigy.
[280:30.67]I'm going to be prepared.
[280:31.67]I have a lot of healing.
[280:33.13]Just melt the guy before his friend comes.
[280:38.23]You hate using your shield against magic?
[280:41.45]That guy does that move where he fucking captures you.
[280:45.93]Can I block?
[280:46.73]I can't block that.
[280:48.99]If he shoots that out, I'm gonna get electrocuted and he's gonna pull me in, right?
[280:51.86]I was gonna say, better not have fucking Old Spice.
[281:02.22]I'm gonna make sure it's not there.
[281:10.44]It's not there.
[281:10.92]Okay, good.
[281:14.10]Okay.
[281:15.78]Let's take a effigy.
[281:21.08]Let's do this.
[281:24.64]Here we go.
[281:27.66]I got my healing.
[281:28.50]I got my shit.
[281:29.38]Let's turn on the turpentine.
[281:32.00]Let's break somebody's head.
[281:40.62]Get over here.
[282:16.02]Oh, fuck.
[282:17.72]Where'd he go?
[282:22.28]Come on.
[282:28.48]I didn't hit him.
[282:34.59]There we go.
[282:35.77]Gonna put that shit back on.
[282:41.07]Fucking Old Spice, come on.
[282:47.73]I don't like that lock on very much.
[282:48.97]Damn it!
[282:54.57]I was at risk.
[282:55.15]Who the fuck are you?
[283:04.00]Will you please land?
[283:04.80]Here's this fucking asshole fucking friend coming in soon here.
[283:14.04]Will you land?
[283:17.14]Why won't he fucking land?
[283:25.58]Why won't he land?
[283:28.20]Why won't he land?
[283:34.53]Fucking stupid forward in R1.
[283:37.43]Why is it in the game?
[283:39.07]I will complain about that a thousand fucking times.
[283:47.70]No, wrong book.
[283:48.94]Oh, God.
[283:59.28]Where's his friend?
[284:05.14]Alright, there he is.
[284:09.26]It's one of them.
[284:14.12]Ow, that hurt.
[284:28.09]That was bad.
[284:42.03]Spread them out.
[284:42.67]Spread them out.
[284:43.29]Don't keep them together.
[284:45.23]Spread them out.
[284:52.52]Oh.
[284:55.56]Oh, they did it back to back, you fuckers.
[285:06.86]Where'd he go?
[285:07.80]One flew away.
[285:22.80]Ah!
[285:25.84]Definitely don't want him behind.
[285:27.24]Please!
[285:27.90]Please, you fucking monkey boy!
[285:29.28]You monkey boy!
[285:30.08]You monkey boys!
[285:32.10]The fucking Wizard of Oz monkeys!
[285:34.26]I get it!
[285:37.49]What's wrong with that one?
[285:38.69]What's wrong with that one?
[285:40.39]What's wrong with this one?
[285:43.29]What's wrong?
[285:43.67]Is this like the Romeo and Juliet encounter?
[285:47.97]Did I beat him?
[285:57.98]Those fucking Wizard of Oz monkey boys are dead.
[286:13.46]My fucking head hurts.
[286:18.21]The Wizard of Haas.
[286:25.81]I think I owe it to the Old Spice.
[286:27.59]No.
[286:29.39]Don't ever buy... You know what?
[286:31.32]If you're an Old Spice representative and you're watching...
[286:42.72]Tom's of Maine is way better.
[286:44.94]Except it's not.
[286:45.66]It isn't.
[286:45.94]Tom's of Maine is terrible.
[286:55.12]Legendary Soldier's Soul.
[287:03.41]I'm gonna put on Ultima.
[287:06.81]Let's go back to the Nexus.
[287:15.77]Who is Toms of Maine?
[287:17.07]Toms of Maine.
[287:26.15]That encounter, really, that is just the Bell Gargoyles.
[287:29.68]I can't even.
[287:32.66]That's the Bell Gargoyles, except they're like 40% faster.
[287:42.54]Blame it on the Old Spice.
[287:47.31]Oh, alright.
[287:48.05]Let me see here.
[287:48.93]I gotta take a look at some stuff.
[287:52.29]Silver Demon, Mixed Demon, Gray Demon.
[287:54.17]I have a lot of these.
[287:55.99]Let's crush all these right now.
[288:02.38]Oh, man.
[288:07.50]The Gorgonites?
[288:10.46]Isn't that, uh... That's Small Soldiers.
[288:16.45]You're pulling out an old one there.
[288:17.94]Are you guys ready for a... crushing stuff stream?
[288:29.40]I have a lot of these, damn.
[288:36.24]Jesus.
[288:38.36]Alright, well, here we go.
[288:39.38]Oh, these are nothing.
[288:45.97]Yeah, I did not have any radishes.
[288:47.53]You know, that might be why I'm so... I got my blood drawn, and I didn't eat any radishes at all.
[288:52.85]That's the problem.
[289:02.72]Am I interested in Divinity 2?
[289:05.78]Um... Not really.
[289:09.30]Looks like it could be fun, but not really in the mood for games like that to play.
[289:18.99]I'm so glad they fixed this in Dark Souls 2.
[289:22.49]Yeah, it is good just to be able to eat them all at the same time.
[289:32.58]Why did I get my bludge on?
[289:33.60]Uh, I was going in for, uh, just sort of kind of a routine check for... I'm gonna get, like, a new doctor for my colitis issues.
[289:46.47]And we were just talking about it.
[289:47.91]And he's like, you know what?
[289:48.67]We probably should just check you out.
[289:50.03]Just check out all your levels.
[289:52.77]And I'm like, okay.
[290:01.01]I have a couple more, right?
[290:03.49]I have two more.
[290:08.41]Legendary Soldier's Soul.
[290:10.24]Let's see how much this is.
[290:11.92]That was a lot.
[290:14.42]Another storied.
[290:19.10]Alright, so silver mixed in gray.
[290:21.44]I think I'm just going to break them.
[290:26.12]Remember, we only are allowed to cheat when we look up what Demon's Souls would you get for them.
[290:35.00]I typed in silver demons into Google and that... The first thing I got was that silver has fucking demonic powers.
[290:43.29]So silver has mystic powers.
[290:46.45]No, you're not going to fool me.
[290:48.89]I've seen your mall kiosk before.
[290:51.70]The people that, like, stop you.
[290:52.76]You know, let's talk about mall kiosks for one second.
[290:56.16]You know when you're in a big mall, and a handful of... They're not a store.
[291:01.12]They're just sitting in the middle of the mall.
[291:03.94]Every, like, maybe, I don't know, 100 feet, maybe there's a kiosk.
[291:07.20]And there's always that overzealous, super overbearing person at one of those kiosks that try to get you to... If you make any eye contact, it's game over.
[291:16.10]Because they're gonna call you over.
[291:18.95]And you don't want to, but you know that no one's going to buy any of the shit that they have there.
[291:23.41]So you just like humor them for a second.
[291:25.19]You walk over and they're like, oh, how do you feel today?
[291:27.71]I feel alright.
[291:28.65]Oh, do you know that the power of magnets around your arm can increase blood flow?
[291:33.24]Like, did you have diarrhea this morning?
[291:35.30]And it's like, yeah, I did.
[291:37.22]And they go, well, they tout this, it's like a cure-all bullshit.
[291:41.86]I bought, I bought, a long time ago, I bought like a fucking face cream from one of these people.
[291:46.78]Because I just, I was scared.
[291:48.34]I wanted to leave.
[291:49.56]The lady grabbed me, she was like putting her hands on my hands, and she was like, oh, let me show you something.
[291:53.96]And she took like a glob of this shit, and she was like, may I?
[291:55.92]I'm like, yeah, go for it.
[291:57.16]And she like rubbed it in, and it was fucking weird and greasy, and I didn't like it.
[292:00.06]So I spent $40 on it just so I could leave.
[292:01.78]It's real.
[292:08.89]See, it worked.
[292:12.29]Okay, I get 36,000 souls if I break the silver demon.
[292:19.78]What is this?
[292:25.14]I'm scared of that.
[292:25.92]There's like a bunch of weird things with this.
[292:35.54]Just empty the tube.
[292:39.41]This one is like, you get a dagger with this one.
[292:41.77]I'm going to break the mixed one.
[292:44.51]I don't really want that.
[292:51.29]It's like a needle thing.
[292:55.60]How many times have I shit myself this stream?
[292:58.82]Zero.
[293:00.72]Last stream?
[293:02.14]Maybe once.
[293:02.56]Hooray.
[293:05.28]We got this from the Taurus Demon.
[293:09.43]Gray Demon Soul, what's this one?
[293:13.84]Dozer Axe.
[293:15.80]Okay, you don't get any souls for breaking this, so I'm not even going to, but Dozer Axe seems kind of interesting, so I'm gonna hold onto it.
[293:24.03]Alright, let's level up.
[293:27.11]A few times.
[293:31.33]You, have you seen my corporeal flesh?
[293:37.32]Has my body gone rotten?
[293:40.14]At least one viewer in the stream has poop in their pants right now.
[293:42.84]I'm not sure I agree.
[293:46.54]I would assume that, like, man, there's like 1,600 people here still.
[293:49.00]It's like midnight Eastern.
[293:50.76]Thanks for sticking around, by the way.
[293:52.62]It's getting kind of late.
[293:54.18]But, I mean, there's over 1,600 people here.
[293:56.33]I have to assume at least 10% of you guys are on the toilet.
[294:01.55]So, 1,600, that's 160 people.
[294:05.09]absolutely are using the toilet right now.
[294:09.60]And then let's go even further.
[294:11.44]Of those 160 people, how many of those people don't have any more toilet paper left?
[294:15.64]I'm going to say maybe 5% because that is a big problem.
[294:17.74]So out of 165%, that's five, like seven people.
[294:21.48]There are seven people that just took a shit that literally don't have any toilet paper left and they're freaking out.
[294:28.02]And of those seven people, what percentage of them are living alone or by themselves in the house?
[294:33.05]Let's say, like, let's say, like, one out of seven of them is currently, like, by themselves in a house.
[294:40.50]That one person, good luck.
[294:42.50]Because there's nothing that that person can do.
[294:44.36]So I'm really sorry.
[294:46.28]I'm really sorry that you are in that situation.
[294:52.87]One of the 1,600.
[294:53.21]I'm sorry.
[294:57.01]Please leave me alone.
[294:57.73]Okay.
[294:58.69]Sure.
[295:00.24]Where's that one guy?
[295:00.88]He's here?
[295:05.77]Get in the shower right now.
[295:10.96]That doesn't work.
[295:12.56]That doesn't work, guys.
[295:13.48]That don't work.
[295:14.98]I've been there before.
[295:15.90]That doesn't do anything.
[295:18.01]Because you think it's gonna work, and you clean yourself up real good.
[295:21.25]Mm-mm.
[295:22.98]All you did, all you did is you made it a little wet, and it, inside of, it doesn't do anything.
[295:28.10]Trust me.
[295:29.20]It's not what you think it does.
[295:30.20]It's not what, that's not, it doesn't work.
[295:34.12]Alright, where's, where's this lady?
[295:38.57]Why is she always in an odd spot?
[295:39.57]Come here.
[295:41.33]You like up there praying?
[295:44.87]Fuck, is she over there?
[295:48.64]Too much information or too little?
[295:50.16]Why are you hanging out with paint?
[295:52.32]That's not paint!
[295:53.08]It's patches!
[295:54.28]I'm about to smash his head in!
[295:57.18]Okay, let's get the strength to 40.
[295:58.32]Oh, can you feel that?
[296:03.58]Shit!
[296:07.38]I wanted to get to 40 at the end of the stream.
[296:09.90]Damn it!
[296:13.12]Oh well.
[296:13.86]Shit.
[296:14.56]I really wanted to get to 40 by the end of the stream.
[296:19.24]Oh, well.
[296:22.32]That means I have to play at least another, like, 20 minutes.
[296:27.72]Replace my late moon grass that I used.
[296:37.06]How much did I use?
[296:43.42]Late moon grass.
[296:44.84]Let me do half moon there.
[296:51.10]And... That's okay for now.
[296:54.93]So where the fuck am I gonna go now?
[296:57.23]It's two fours done.
[297:00.11]One four.
[297:00.95]I mean... I did that, right?
[297:03.17]I guess I could... Could I go?
[297:04.17]I just want to check this out one more time.
[297:10.86]Kill Patches while he's on the toilet.
[297:19.46]Go to the...
[297:22.81]Why do I have a painting as a shield?
[297:24.07]Because it regenerates health, and it has a picture of a fat guy on it, and I think that's funny.
[297:29.36]I'm an immature... baby.
[297:31.46]Wait, is that the guy's body?
[297:32.68]Uh, look who it is, everybody!
[297:33.96]Awww, is that who you- is that the guy that everybody likes?
[297:39.46]Oh, it's the sun bro!
[297:40.78]There he is!
[297:42.92]And I fuckin' chopped his face off.
[297:52.60]I know it's not him.
[297:53.62]I know.
[297:54.02]I'm just trying to... Troll the chitties.
[297:56.78]The chitty chatters.
[297:58.32]I'm trying to troll the chitty chatters.
[298:00.14]Uh, okay.
[298:07.09]What's up here?
[298:11.89]I know.
[298:12.15]That's one of, like, the default magician guys that shoots the fire out of his hands.
[298:15.69]I'm just messing around.
[298:23.95]There.
[298:27.99]Oh my god.
[298:29.05]Do I have to actually fight the Trine video game heroes up there?
[298:36.72]This is like Trine 4.
[298:38.52]They're currently on this level to go through here.
[298:40.32]That's a lot of fucking invaders.
[298:55.98]Is this a dragon?
[298:56.64]What even is this thing?
[299:00.62]It actually is Trine.
[299:02.26]You have the ranger, the tank, the knight, and the magician.
[299:11.08]How fast do you want to die?
[299:12.66]Is my question.
[299:16.83]Never fucking run in.
[299:19.75]You're not even supposed to... You're not even a tank and you just killed yourself.
[299:46.24]Good move.
[299:48.06]Good fucking move.
[299:49.18]Good... Why does that move fucking exist?
[299:59.05]Oh my god, why does that move fucking exist?
[300:03.21]Why can't that be, like, hold something else besides up in R1 that doesn't need to be there?
[300:10.67]And I wish I could remove it.
[300:14.79]God, why?
[300:15.45]That guy's dead.
[300:16.93]If this fucking stupid fucking PvP move that nobody uses.
[300:25.11]Oh man, I fucking hate it.
[300:26.63]I wish I could turn it off.
[300:27.65]I've never used that move in any of these Souls games.
[300:30.97]Not one time.
[300:33.24]I think maybe I did it once in Dark Souls 1 to kick a guy's shield.
[300:37.36]But it's in every game and it's fucking useless.
[300:41.84]Like, why can't I just, like, why can't they be like, press in left stick?
[300:44.66]Right?
[300:44.94]That's not bound to anything.
[300:46.52]Why can't left stick be that move?
[300:49.06]Why does it have to be the fucking move that happens all the fucking time?
[300:59.00]That dude is dead.
[301:00.49]Fucking every time.
[301:02.59]Except, no, he's not.
[301:05.07]That's such, I hate it.
[301:06.65]More than anything in this whole game.
[301:07.97]In this whole entire franchise.
[301:09.89]Is that fucking forward R1.
[301:14.20]I disagree, I've seen you use it several times in the last few minutes.
[301:18.77]It's because I'm fucking unintentionally pressing the fucking button!
[301:23.98]Because it's ev- I'm always walking, and you're always hitting R1.
[301:28.74]So you're gonna fucking randomly just do it, and it's gonna ruin fucking attempts.
[301:38.94]It makes me want to pull my fucking hair out.
[301:43.33]And then sell it.
[301:46.19]Where do you think like a Jerm of hair would go?
[301:49.09]I'm not a con.
[301:49.71]Like one hair.
[301:51.71]If I just like... Just pulled out a hair.
[301:53.45]Do you think I'd get more than five dollars for that?
[302:01.26]Fucking lord.
[302:10.71]I'm so angry.
[302:11.67]Like, this should have just been done.
[302:12.79]I would have fucking narrowed it down.
[302:14.11]I would have killed that guy.
[302:15.95]I'm just beyond annoyed.
[302:17.95]Get back here.
[302:52.99]Holy shit, that's a lot of souls and he dropped an item.
[302:54.96]I don't want to lose that I'm gonna play ring around the Rosie with you.
[303:02.18]It's a sword.
[303:02.62]It was some kind of sword.
[303:03.24]I don't know what the hell it was Running into shit
[303:23.21]He's got a spear.
[303:23.99]Fuck.
[303:24.57]It's over for me.
[303:31.89]Skeletor.
[303:39.40]Why did that not hit him?
[303:44.04]I can't, man.
[303:44.92]It's fucking... I can't do it.
[303:47.20]I can't fight the spears.
[303:50.85]They're too quick and they do so much fucking damage.
[303:54.26]Stop talking.
[304:02.20]Jesus Christ.
[304:06.03]Use the useless attack the one time that I need it.
[304:08.15]I know.
[304:08.45]I'm... I... I can't carry anymore.
[304:10.81]Of course.
[304:14.07]Roll and stab.
[304:15.11]I don't have a stab with this thing.
[304:16.75]I have a lunge and throw all my weight behind it attack.
[304:25.03]Where's that item?
[304:27.97]Take the cling ring off, who cares?
[304:33.83]Come on, that was close.
[304:35.18]I thought that was a tower shield.
[304:40.68]Okay, I can't let this person fuck me up.
[304:42.62]Because they will.
[304:43.30]I can't let it happen.
[304:44.14]They have a crossbow.
[304:45.34]Take up the shield.
[304:47.08]Just block it.
[304:49.04]Get rid of the Wizard of Oz.
[304:50.94]Does he have a melee weapon?
[304:52.12]Does he have like a knife?
[304:54.17]I'm sure he does.
[304:55.27]I'm sure she does.
[304:56.05]Is it a girl?
[304:56.63]I think it is.
[304:57.55]And why won't you shoot?
[304:58.39]Take this bullshit again.
[305:10.31]Going for it.
[305:24.30]Holy shit, that was so lucky.
[305:36.00]Why can't you move?
[305:36.80]Why can't you move, man?
[305:40.74]I'm gonna grab him by the nose.
[305:43.92]This health thing, man, sucks.
[305:45.34]Do it.
[305:45.66]Fuck it.
[305:46.52]Go ahead.
[305:46.86]Shoot again.
[305:55.09]Take it.
[305:55.45]Take your time.
[305:55.91]Take my time.
[306:04.59]This is the chance.
[306:05.13]This is my chance.
[306:05.71]This is my chance!
[306:17.09]Not with this half health, man.
[306:18.59]You might call me a cheese ball.
[306:20.99]But not with 50% max health.
[306:25.28]You can call me Parmesan for all you want.
[306:27.26]Okay, I have a lot.
[306:35.36]I only want, like, enough to level up one more time.
[306:38.50]I have enough to level up, like, three times.
[306:43.19]Just to make sure I don't miss anything.
[306:44.77]Because I am going to get gone.
[306:50.27]41k.
[306:53.59]Pretty good.
[306:56.83]Can't get through there.
[306:57.56]I'm sure that probably opens at some point.
[306:59.80]Take one peek down here.
[307:02.98]Bug.
[307:03.46]That's what I know.
[307:04.28]Okay, I gotta get you.
[307:05.06]Come on.
[307:05.60]One last bug.
[307:10.62]Nice.
[307:14.86]I hear somebody.
[307:25.62]Please come up.
[307:26.16]I don't want to fight you in there.
[307:33.71]Don't you ever show yourself like that.
[307:35.37]That was a mistake.
[307:41.58]Oh no.
[307:52.70]Those guys don't respawn, do they?
[307:54.06]Hold on.
[307:57.82]Does that group respawn?
[307:59.06]No.
[307:59.62]Of course they don't.
[308:01.02]Just go get my shit.
[308:01.99]It's right there.
[308:02.67]There's a bug.
[308:07.11]We'll get that bug later.
[308:08.17]Another time.
[308:18.31]Wait, did I already get this?
[308:19.21]I get to get it again.
[308:22.57]Cool.
[308:24.57]Alright, let's try this again, buddy.
[308:31.27]Not gonna fuck around this time.
[308:40.58]No!
[308:41.24]Please don't do it again!
[308:44.45]I'm like so, no.
[308:46.09]I'm like so tired and done.
[308:48.75]When you play this, when you play any Souls game, more than like four or five hours, it's just like, sometimes you just gotta call it quits, right?
[308:58.17]Sometimes I'm just so greedy and like so just unfocused.
[309:02.60]I just need to fucking level up and like be done.
[309:09.20]I just gotta be done with it.
[309:10.14]Just be done with it.
[309:10.80]Just get your souls and get out of here.
[309:14.43]There's no reason for this.
[309:17.57]I can get this again.
[309:18.45]This seriously is just Groundhog Day.
[309:20.09]Why can I get you every time?
[309:22.73]You always have shit for me to get.
[309:24.09]Too late.
[309:31.36]I don't have enough time.
[309:34.28]I can't let this guy best me.
[309:37.46]Holy shit, he turned really fast.
[309:46.01]Is this Groundhog Day?
[309:50.15]Oh shit!
[309:51.31]It's time to go to bed.
[309:53.19]It's time to go to bed.
[309:53.97]It's time to go to bed.
[309:57.07]It's time to go to bed.
[310:00.47]It's time to go to bed.
[310:08.43]No.
[310:08.91]Go.
[310:09.25]Goodbye.
[310:15.57]Alright, let's get out of here.
[310:21.85]Yeah, watch out for the arrows, I know.
[310:23.31]A lot of progress tonight.
[310:28.20]I'm fairly close to the end of each area, right?
[310:32.92]Each zone.
[310:34.84]Let's level up once or twice.
[310:37.10]Finish the fight.
[310:37.78]I did.
[310:40.64]I'm going to level up and I'm going to deposit.
[310:50.01]What is this?
[310:57.08]Did that guy die?
[310:57.74]I think that guy died.
[311:00.46]The guy that was like, My body!
[311:02.06]My body!
[311:02.46]I think he's dead.
[311:03.12]I don't know.
[311:05.04]What?
[311:19.27]I did not kill that guy.
[311:25.25]Alright, let's get to 40.
[311:26.35]Let's get to the soft cap.
[311:29.79]And then, uh, endurance.
[311:31.89]Endurance.
[311:33.11]Can't even do it.
[311:33.83]I need 20,000.
[311:33.99]That's okay.
[311:34.51]I'm gonna buy just an absolute shitload of these.
[311:42.16]Yeah.
[311:50.95]I never want to have to buy these again.
[311:52.73]Sixty one of these.
[311:54.31]I will never have to purchase another one of these ever again.
[312:01.87]I'm going to deposit.
[312:08.64]I don't even need these anymore.
[312:10.26]Not anymore.
[312:10.68]Not now.
[312:16.60]All these.
[312:17.54]Get rid of the fucking Old Spice.
[312:21.02]So I can not accidentally have it appear on my bar.
[312:25.08]These... I haven't used any of these yet.
[312:27.55]Like, I'm not going to.
[312:28.95]Why would I?
[312:32.55]Some of these don't need to stay.
[312:33.56]The chunks can... You know... Okay, if he's storing the chunks, can I still upgrade my weapons?
[312:43.82]Does it take them from the stash?
[312:46.50]Penetrating sword.
[312:48.94]Be cool.
[312:51.86]Put the rapier in there.
[312:55.93]Light bow.
[312:57.39]Power shield.
[313:01.27]Goldmask.
[313:07.15]Should I wear this?
[313:09.01]Probably not.
[313:11.73]I'm going to get rid of these rings that I'm never going to use.
[313:14.03]I don't know.
[313:20.62]Who cares?
[313:24.22]You have a heart of gold.
[313:25.62]I have a heart of gold.
[313:27.88]I just want to go see... Let me see...
[313:41.64]chat gets raunchy at night they tend to hey ivory thanks for the five dollars I'm so proud of the progress you made Jeremy I'm rather sad though because it'll be two days to stream on Friday it'll still be two days till you stream this Friday it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry uh home of the birchmont by the way this is oh this is this this is it's too late it's too late right
[314:07.93]You're the song king and the song queen at the same time.
[314:14.27]Warvoi, thanks for the $5.
[314:16.71]Happy belated birthday, Jeremiah.
[314:17.79]I can't send you a whole pallet of raisins if these bits will do.
[314:24.06]You never buy raisins.
[314:25.28]You never purchase raisins.
[314:28.26]Thank you, Blastoise, for the $1.
[314:30.12]Thank you, Warvoi.
[314:30.92]That's very kind of you.
[314:32.46]Thank you, Blastoise.
[314:33.16]Hey, Gerber, do you have any diaper recommendations?
[314:35.06]I currently use Huggies, but I find that they just seem to handle my massive bouts of... They can't handle your massive bouts of diarrhea.
[314:45.37]Just get a pillowcase and just sit in it.
[314:47.48]That's what I do.
[314:49.81]Uh, die, thank you, die, tro, for the five dollars.
[314:54.17]Uh, Jeremy, you can use this, only use this money to buy Old Spice products.
[314:57.04]Fine.
[314:57.90]I'll buy a deodorant and I will, like, I'll use it and be upset.
[315:01.59]Thank you for the five dollars.
[315:02.95]Uh, never trust purple, thanks for five bucks.
[315:05.39]When Jerma sees a spear, even so much as fucking glimpses an inch of one, his brain instantly shuts down.
[315:09.97]It's fucking hilarious.
[315:11.68]I can't, I'm telling you, that's like, everybody has the thing in these games that they can't deal with.
[315:15.48]For me, it is a straight stabbing spear.
[315:19.04]Because it seems like even if I try to dodge left or dodge right, I still get hit by the hitbox.
[315:24.64]It's the bane of my existence.
[315:26.79]But thanks, bro.
[315:29.87]Uh, Rebio, thank you for the $3.
[315:31.47]Hey, Jerma, any plans to play Okami?
[315:33.01]We already talked about that!
[315:36.02]I think I'm caught up on bits.
[315:36.84]Thanks, guys.
[315:38.34]Let's just check the blacksmith, because I just want to see something.
[315:41.89]And then we are going to say goodbye.
[315:43.45]And then I will be live on Thursday.
[315:47.55]We'll be playing more... Okay.
[315:52.07]That doesn't kill me, but everything else does.
[315:58.59]Wow.
[316:01.13]I need a colorless demon's soul.
[316:05.86]Yes, we're going to do more Demon's Souls on Thursday and then Cuphead is launching on Friday.
[316:24.17]And unfortunately, sorry to say, Cuphead is not online co-op.
[316:33.31]Cuphead has no online co-op.
[316:37.33]So I will not be playing that initially like we thought with Etalyx.
[316:44.54]There's only couch co-op, unfortunately, at lunch.
[316:47.16]That's the way it's going to be.
[316:52.70]So I will be playing Cuphead on Friday.
[316:56.47]Go to Etalyx' house.
[317:00.97]No more Darkest Dungeons.
[317:03.06]Yeah, it's just, ugh.
[317:04.44]I wish.
[317:04.98]There's, I have a lot, here's the thing.
[317:07.45]Sometimes when I stream, before stream or like a couple days like you know sometimes on the weekends I'm like: What do I want to play for this this like week?
[317:16.95]And I come up with like a plan or something or maybe I'll check this out or I do this or I'll do that.
[317:20.00]A lot of times you run into the situation where you're like: I don't know like - what the fuck do I even want to play?
[317:26.00]There's like nothing I really want to play right now. That's happened a few times over the last like six months.
[317:31.00]So it's nice to be able to know that I have a ton of games that I'm like I want to play.
[317:37.88]Demon's Souls, Cuphead, Darkest Dungeon, PlayStation 3, like, trash games.
[317:44.40]There's a lot.
[317:45.96]I'm not starved for ideas in, like, the streaming world.
[317:54.35]So, it does happen from time to time.
[317:58.07]But currently, immensely enjoying Demon's Souls.
[318:03.51]Okay, so I've put how long of it?
[318:05.43]Maybe like 15 hours?
[318:06.29]16 hours in the game so far?
[318:08.26]Maybe somewhere under 20 hours?
[318:12.24]Yeah, I told you guys that I thought this game was really, really good.
[318:15.02]I thought it was like right underneath Bloodborne for me.
[318:19.80]I think so.
[318:20.65]I think it goes... I think this is more fun than Dark Souls 1 and 2.
[318:30.12]So I would keep it where it is for me.
[318:33.55]Bloodborne number one, Dark Souls 3, 2, Demon's Souls.
[318:38.11]And then like Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 can kind of just be in a constant choking match.
[318:45.24]Those two can have both their hands around each other's necks and just squeeze and just try to choke each other to death.
[318:50.36]Because I can't, I don't want to put one above the other because I haven't beaten Dark Souls 1.
[318:53.74]It's the only one I haven't really beaten.
[319:01.16]Try playing it.
[319:02.32]Well, I beat Dark Souls 2 and Scholar.
[319:07.29]And I did that off stream.
[319:09.99]I didn't really want to stream Dark Souls or anything.
[319:12.73]Dark Souls 3 came out and I was like, you know what?
[319:14.13]Fuck it.
[319:14.31]I'm going to stream it.
[319:15.69]And that was a ton of fun.
[319:17.21]Those streams were some of my favorite streams I've probably ever done.
[319:21.57]And I'm getting that same itch playing this on stream.
[319:26.41]So, maybe I would play Dark Souls 1 and start from scratch and just go.
[319:34.08]But probably not anytime soon.
[319:37.00]Because I'm getting my fill of souls.
[319:40.54]And after, like... Because I'm assuming I'm going to beat this game on stream.
[319:45.55]Like, I'm going to continue to play this.
[319:47.83]Why would I stop now?
[319:49.65]I'm too invested in Demon's Souls to not just complete it on stream.
[319:53.47]Why wouldn't I?
[319:56.09]Dark Souls 2 is better than Dark Souls 3.
[319:59.43]I mean, everybody has their own bible for what games belong where.
[320:05.63]For me, it's the combat.
[320:07.89]The way the animation is combat, it's a lot less clunky.
[320:11.25]Dark Souls 3 might not be the best level design and video game, but just the combat alone and the animations alone are enough for me to think it's better.
[320:23.20]Dark Souls 1 just feels old.
[320:27.31]Even after they did, like, the update, even after they did, like, the... Prepare to die on PlayStation 3!
[320:34.02]This game feels old, but they... It's still... I'm still okay with it.
[320:40.86]There are a few things in this game that I think are really stupid.
[320:44.45]Like, the five fucking six different healing items, I think, is just a little too much.
[320:52.76]But besides that, just being able to fast travel like Bloodborne, it's hitting the same notes for me like Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne did.
[321:12.45]Dark Souls 3 is great level design, but reused ideas.
[321:16.71]Yeah, but I mean, also, that's, think about it.
[321:19.43]They've made, they've made this game, like, just, just, not even, like, the same game, like, in quotes.
[321:24.01]Oh, every Dark Souls is the fucking same.
[321:26.97]But just, just look at this.
[321:28.11]Look at this game you're looking at on the screen right now.
[321:30.76]This game, Demon's Souls.
[321:32.54]They made this game four times.
[321:37.16]Right?
[321:37.54]Like, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, and no, five times.
[321:43.38]Bloodborne.
[321:45.34]They kind of remade this game five times.
[321:48.30]Like, four times.
[321:50.72]So, obviously, this exact formula, it's... They've done everything that they probably wanted to do with the series.
[322:03.67]Learning to count with Jerma.
[322:04.93]Well, yeah.
[322:05.41]Well, I meant, like, how many times that they made this game again.
[322:10.28]Because this just came out of nowhere.
[322:11.60]This was not one of those games that was hyped, or, oh, here, this new game from FromSoftware.
[322:15.95]It's called Demon's Souls, and it fucking makes you cry.
[322:18.19]It got a little following, and more people started talking about it.
[322:22.21]I don't think they ever planned on making this game four more times.
[322:29.29]But I love it.
[322:30.43]Even if it's the same type of shit, this formula...
[322:37.22]This exact formula here with the really hard bosses, the really intricate level designs, and the really cool progress through the levels and be careful, you're going to get killed, but look out, there's all this cool shit.
[322:50.05]It's my favorite.
[322:52.57]It's absolutely my favorite type of video game that's probably ever been released.
[322:59.30]Bloodborne is probably my favorite game ever made at this point.
[323:02.86]It might be.
[323:03.58]It might be.
[323:07.15]So, even if it's, like, if we get Bloodborne 2 or something, and it's, like, the same fucking game, but, like, with a couple extra weapons and a different... I'm still gonna probably buy it, and I'm still gonna love it.
[323:20.32]Jeremy, just go to bed so I can.
[323:22.56]Bloodborne sucks, though.
[323:23.82]Oh, no.
[323:24.64]No, no.
[323:25.62]No, it doesn't.
[323:26.37]No!
[323:27.21]Don't say that!
[323:29.47]Bloodborne's like atmosphere and storyline and just strangeness and oddness.
[323:36.13]The oddities in Bloodborne, just how fucking weird you feel while playing that game.
[323:41.27]I've never experienced that before.
[323:42.72]It's just so creepy and fucking weird.
[323:50.66]Back to bed.
[323:52.56]Oh, wrong opinion time.
[323:58.46]But everybody has their baby, right?
[324:02.99]That's why I would never say that I think, like, Dark Souls 1 sucks.
[324:06.95]Because it's not true.
[324:08.71]That's just an untrue statement.
[324:13.13]Usually the one that you started with is the one that you think is the best.
[324:19.47]Bloodborne is the one that I actually really truly played first.
[324:24.63]Sure, I made a video on Dark Souls.
[324:27.28]Go watch it.
[324:28.56]It's awful.
[324:30.37]I don't even understand the game.
[324:32.13]We brought this up like a week ago.
[324:38.41]I won't even put King's Field on the list.
[324:41.23]No, I'm not gonna put like a fucking old Atari game.
[324:44.13]Like an old 1993 MS-DOS game that they made.
[324:49.43]And they made like six of them, right? ...
[324:59.21]Takes the game in a different... I mean, there are problems with Bloodborne.
[325:01.73]I think Bloodborne has... Issues in regards to, like... Sameness.
[325:08.72]Right?
[325:08.98]Like... Yharnam.
[325:12.00]Old Yharnam.
[325:13.12]Super Yharnam.
[325:15.30]Goofy Yharnam.
[325:16.22]Like, they kind of reused a lot of assets in Bloodborne.
[325:19.22]Oh, watch out for this spooky graveyard.
[325:22.36]Watch out for the spooky graveyard.
[325:23.68]Careful, you're in a spooky graveyard.
[325:25.33]Now there's a swamp.
[325:26.75]Yes.
[325:27.57]I agree.
[325:30.43]Any game released before 2015 is hot trash.
[325:32.77]Bloodborne came out in 2014, didn't it?
[325:36.41]When did Bloodborne actually launch?
[325:37.89]2014, right?
[325:38.25]Or was it 2015?
[325:38.47]It was early 2015, right?
[325:39.51]Like, February or something?
[325:40.17]Let me see...
[326:00.40]uh it was march so it's still fairly early I have a court debate this topic craze streamer holds viewers hostage by refusing to end stream I'm just winding down like this I mean I I know it's late but I mean if you gotta go you gotta go right
[326:25.74]I'm just doing a little wind-down discussion of the series, because I think I've put enough time into Demon's Souls where I can give a real opinion on it.
[326:32.36]And obviously, like, all jokes aside, not, like, fucking around, because, like, I mean, obviously, I fuck around a lot.
[326:37.57]And I talk a lot of shit.
[326:39.67]But, you know, obviously, a lot of it's not meant to be taken super-duper seriously.
[326:43.55]Like, when I say the game is terrible, that's not what I mean.
[326:47.29]I mean, the game just, like, sucks.
[326:51.61]But all jokes aside...
[326:54.93]This, to me, is what I wanted Dark Souls 1 to be.
[326:58.71]If that makes any sense.
[327:00.09]Coming from Bloodborne.
[327:00.81]Remember, Bloodborne is my first real, actual, like, playthrough of this whole game.
[327:04.61]Did I know?
[327:06.29]Did I beat Dark Souls 2 before Bloodborne?
[327:08.18]I think I... No, I didn't.
[327:10.58]I'm trying to remember the timeline here in my brain.
[327:13.80]But Bloodborne... Yeah, I beat Bloodborne first before I went back and played everything else.
[327:21.01]So Bloodborne, me coming from Bloodborne, and I'm like, oh, Dark Souls 1!
[327:24.95]Oh, I can't wait!
[327:26.03]It's gonna be just like my favorite game, Bloodborne!
[327:28.83]And it wasn't.
[327:30.13]Like, this game, Demon's Souls, is what I wanted Bloodborne's predecessor to be.
[327:34.93]This is what I wanted Dark Souls 1 to be.
[327:38.59]Feels more like Bloodborne.
[327:49.82]I haven't said anything new for, like, 35 minutes.
[327:51.88]Yeah, well, this is when we just, like, go to bed on stream, and I, like, repeat myself, like, nine times.
[328:03.48]Alright, well, that's it.
[328:07.54]Well, I'm responding to what you guys are writing in chat, so me, okay, me res- me res- me repeating myself is me responding more to chat.
[328:20.50]Wrap it up, old man.
[328:22.18]You want me to fucking hold R2 right now?
[328:23.72]I will.
[328:24.66]Don't test me.
[328:33.44]I will try Dark Souls 1 again.
[328:35.11]I don't know if I'll do it on stream.
[328:38.23]Can I respond to this message?
[328:39.25]Yo, what's up?
[328:41.57]Alright, goodnight guys.
[328:42.77]I will see you dudes on...
[328:52.81]Thursday.
[329:01.16]Overconfident streamer thinks Bloodborne is better than Armored Core.
[329:06.89]They're making another one, I think, aren't they?
[329:11.13]I'm pretty sure they are.
[329:14.09]Fucking finally.
[329:15.27]What?
[329:15.63]Hold on.
[329:17.35]Like... Why is everybody so mad that I haven't gone to bed yet?
[329:22.35]You know, there's like an X in the top right corner of your screen.
[329:27.85]Like I've said, it's time to end the stream.
[329:29.45]I'm ending the stream.
[329:30.13]And then we talked a little bit about, like, Bloodborne and shit.
[329:32.60]Like, you know, like, turn the stream off.
[329:35.50]I'm attached to the fucking cord.
[329:37.48]I'm locked into the computer.
[329:40.88]You have to stop streaming.
[329:42.02]Otherwise, like, I can't pull the cord out of my head.
[329:50.84]Are you guys real?
[329:52.28]When I press stop streaming, do all your computers turn off?
[329:59.70]Help me, please.
[330:02.30]I'm not mad.
[330:02.98]No, I'm just kidding with you, man.
[330:05.50]I'm just fucking around.
[330:09.47]Don't be so selfish.
[330:13.97]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[330:16.79]I'll see you Thursday.
[330:17.59]Much love.
[330:18.39]Take care.
[330:34.50]You know, it would have been a bad idea.
[330:36.50]But I was honestly thinking about just leaving the stream on and going to bed.
[330:41.53]Just keeping it on.
[330:43.41]I would probably get banned from Twitch, though.
[330:44.89]So, no.
[330:45.75]Good night, everybody.
[330:46.37]Bye-bye.
[331:04.56]Thank you.
