[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.56]Oh, so you guys are the type to talk through the previews of the movie, huh?
[00:09.60]Oh, okay.
[00:12.42]I mean, don't you want to see what happens in the trailer?
[00:16.86]For... The haunting of First Name, Last Name?
[00:22.32]That's coming out this year.
[00:26.92]Oh, no?
[00:28.49]Alright, fine.
[00:29.01]I'll be right back.
[01:10.23]Alright.
[01:10.69]I got, uh... I got milk duds.
[01:14.00]I got an extra large soda.
[01:16.54]I got... Those, uh... Those things they only seem to sell at movie theaters.
[01:22.18]They got snow caps.
[01:24.12]It's like a little chocolate with the crunchy, sugary snow on the side.
[01:27.67]They're disgusting, but they only sell them here.
[01:30.31]Okay, I got that.
[01:30.97]I got my drink.
[01:31.43]I got my large popcorn.
[01:33.85]Okay, that was $64.00.
[01:37.66]And I think we're ready to go.
[01:39.10]Welcome, everybody.
[01:39.58]We're not going yet, though.
[01:40.84]Hold on.
[01:42.99]Don't move.
[01:44.49]Everybody stay in your seats.
[01:46.19]Nobody get up.
[01:48.13]I'm standing up right now.
[01:53.60]Buttered popcorn, extra cost.
[01:57.52]Yeah, we're going to stall here for a minute just because I don't know how long this stream is going to be.
[02:02.54]There are 300, 364 videos.
[02:10.07]So some of them are ranging from 10 seconds to 2 minutes.
[02:13.41]It's pretty much like a 40, you know, 40, 40, 10, 50, 50-ish of videos that are really, really short and videos that are long.
[02:23.77]So just know that.
[02:25.69]We may be here for a while.
[02:27.33]It might be a three hour stream.
[02:28.49]It might be like a four to five hour stream.
[02:30.79]I don't know.
[02:31.95]We might get halfway through and need a break.
[02:34.41]Because this is just like shit post Sunday today.
[02:39.36]If your submission did not make it into this movie night, do not think that the submission was bad or sucked or wasn't good enough.
[02:46.22]It just didn't fit the criteria for tonight.
[02:48.64]You know?
[02:50.90]There were a lot of submissions.
[02:53.34]And some of them may, you know, may have been... All of them were screened, right?
[02:57.41]So some of them may have been too loud, or... Just blasting music, or... Too copyright.
[03:03.71]Or maybe... Maybe not copyright enough on some of them.
[03:06.61]I'm kidding on that last one.
[03:09.16]But there was some small... You know, I... We had to keep this one... Clean.
[03:14.28]And some shit may have gotten through.
[03:15.82]I don't know.
[03:17.24]It's very possible.
[03:20.22]The playlist is going, yes, right now this is on a, um, it's a private playlist.
[03:25.09]So, after this, we can assume we'll just, you know, why not everybody just have it, not a big deal.
[03:34.61]But there was a lot of work that went into this, especially for the mods.
[03:40.07]A lot of time, hundreds of submissions.
[03:43.27]I've seen a bunch of them because I had to obviously, you know, veto certain ones and be involved in the process.
[03:49.89]But a brunt of the actual screening here was done by the mods.
[03:58.19]And I want to point out one mod in particular, Grump Klump.
[04:03.62]Everybody had its contributions, but Grump.
[04:07.55]Fucking fantastic.
[04:13.75]We're talking like spreadsheets and... Yeah, this is very, very, very well done.
[04:23.33]Anyways, I don't know how this is gonna go.
[04:27.17]We may... We're gonna... I've never done anything like this before, so...
[04:32.59]Thank you everybody for participating.
[04:35.14]You guys are a fucking hilarious, ridiculous community.
[04:38.66]And I couldn't ask for anything better, so.
[04:41.18]I am looking forward to seeing what you guys came up with.
[04:44.13]364.

[17:37.65]What a god of a gamer.
[17:39.13]Seriously.

[17:49.60]Jerma Quest?
[17:51.30]Oh god.
[18:06.91]I love the aisles there.
[18:08.84]They're large.
[18:12.44]So, basically, that's my thoughts on the Cloverfield trilogy.
[18:19.15]Huh?
[18:23.19]Well, then, who are you?
[18:28.21]What is happening?
[18:29.20]I don't understand.

[19:17.27]Oh my god.
[19:24.79]I'm processing the last three that we just watched.
[19:29.20]Jerma saves Krusty.
[19:33.16]Who is Krusty?
[19:33.66]Is this Krusty?
[19:34.84]That's Krusty.
[19:40.04]Alright.
[19:45.66]I don't know where... That's the hallway from Doom 3.
[19:52.81]Dead Space.
[19:55.79]Alright.
[19:57.47]I think we're good.
[19:58.55]That was a nice little breather.
[20:00.38]I like the Jerma quest.
[20:02.84]Going through... I like the end of the internet connection dropping out.
[20:05.78]That's a pretty... That's a pretty good bit there.
[20:12.44]Alright.
[20:13.64]Here we go.
[20:14.92]Next one coming up.
[20:17.37]Anthrocon shootout.
[20:18.87]No, don't be the raptor.
[20:19.63]No, it's the fucking raptor.
[20:41.73]How do I delete a post?
[20:45.64]How do I delete, what's that meme?
[20:56.38]This is so awkward.
[21:01.49]This is called Wasp.
[21:04.21]That's a pretty good echo.
[21:05.09]It's not a bad idea.
[21:06.35]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[21:10.74]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[21:14.03]Okay, he landed.
[21:14.81]The added echo was a good touch.
[21:17.41]Oh, fuck you, guns!
[21:19.83]Derva Combat, final render!
[21:24.71]And I'm pixelated against 16-bit graphics in this one.
[21:43.88]That was done.
[21:44.40]That was done well.
[21:45.10]Batter up.
[21:45.40]We're gonna get caught.
[21:46.09]Wait, what?
[21:47.19]This is called hello.
[22:16.88]No, not another one of these.
[22:18.71]Don't you dance.
[22:21.11]Can we just do this one?
[22:24.99]We already did this one.
[22:26.46]No, not another one of these.
[22:31.26]Oh.
[22:47.22]I hate this.
[22:47.90]I hate it.
[22:49.20]Why did I drive through on the tricycle?
[22:52.66]Alright, hold on, hold on a second.
[22:56.86]Ugh.
[23:20.19]It's only been 25 minutes.
[23:25.67]I've already... The energy that's come out of my body, it's as if it's been going for four hours.
[23:34.33]Fucking hilarious.
[23:37.82]You know, I wasn't... I had some thoughts about it.
[23:40.46]Was this a good idea or not?
[23:42.66]Should I not do that?
[23:44.06]Maybe that's not a good... Oh, you guys have proven that this was a fucking amazing, amazing thing to do.
[23:52.87]On an offhanded comment in the fucking chat.
[23:55.93]I'm so... This is fucking so much fun.
[23:58.70]Here we go.
[23:59.70]It's called Jerma Saves the Day Remastered.
[24:02.70]This is a remastered edition.
[24:03.90]Forget about the... Forget about the one that came before it.
[24:08.74]Pull it back to the beginning.
[24:20.26]I don't know what this game is.
[24:22.97]I don't know what this game is.

[24:52.68]You are a courier hired by the Mojave Express.
[24:56.42]Short streamer makes last delivery.
[25:00.88]What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn for the worse.
[25:07.07]That was fucking funny.
[25:10.27]You got what you were after, so pay up.
[25:13.11]You're crying in the rain, Pally.
[25:16.93]Guess who's waking up over here?

[25:23.11]Time to cash out.
[25:25.49]Would you get it over with?
[25:28.07]Maybe Khans kill people without looking them in the face.
[25:32.05]But I ain't a fink.
[25:33.71]Dig?
[25:35.48]I'm awake, though.
[25:38.68]You've made your last delivery, kid.
[25:42.30]Sorry you got twisted up in this scene.
[25:46.94]From where you're kneeling must seem like an 18-carat run of bad luck.
[25:52.94]Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
[25:56.35]You got me.
[26:15.78]You got me.

[26:53.07]I'm half off the bed.
[27:22.05]That's the punchline.
[27:41.86]I don't know what the punchline is.
[27:45.85]What the fuck?
[27:54.86]What?
[28:00.33]What's with the sands?

[30:31.96]Why?
[30:32.18]I don't understand.

[34:43.38]Uncle at a wedding.
[34:46.66]He had like three drinks and he became extraordinarily intoxicated.
[34:52.52]Well, that was fantastic.
[34:53.78]Let's get the next one.
[34:58.40]Jerms Bond.
[35:01.14]Okay, here we go.
[35:03.40]Jesus!
[35:03.96]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[35:14.24]I'm good.
[35:15.68]I'm good.
[35:19.68]Oh, shit.
[35:22.26]He looks like he's in the backseat, that's why this- that's how this is good.
[35:30.48]I'm just his driver.
[35:32.68]I'm taking you guys on the scenic route!
[35:45.33]No!
[35:47.25]Fucking loser.
[35:48.63]Loser.
[35:52.22]What?
[35:52.70]The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[35:56.50]What?
[36:06.23]Somebody used it.
[36:07.33]This is terrible.
[36:08.57]This is by far absolutely terrible.
[36:12.09]This is my favorite part.
[36:13.53]Nothing about this is good.
[36:14.56]This is the best part.
[36:15.36]Not one thing.
[36:16.12]Stop talking.
[36:16.66]This is the best part.
[36:17.78]Turn it up.
[36:19.71]Get the shutters off.
[36:20.51]Shut them all off.
[36:21.67]Turn your lights on your house off, too.
[36:23.11]That was great.
[36:34.08]Oh, here comes another JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[36:38.04]When you've played Half-Life at least three times.
[36:40.87]HD remaster enhanced edition.
[36:47.87]But as I was saying, the best part about the last one was when you key somebody into a scene and there's a car, that guy looked like he was in the back seat.
[36:56.54]So it was fine.
[36:57.48]It didn't look like I was superimposed over him.
[37:00.56]That was well done.
[37:01.24]Alright, here we go.
[37:11.77]Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times.
[37:15.99]Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform.
[37:23.17]In the event of an emergency, passengers are... What?
[37:28.51]What?
[37:29.09]Oh, Half-Life!
[37:32.68]Half-Life!
[37:33.28]Where's Professor?
[37:34.00]Where's Professor?
[37:36.92]Where's Professor Barnsworth?
[37:42.33]No, don't fucking dab me here.
[37:44.67]Come on, man.
[37:45.99]Oh my god.
[38:15.85]Wait, there's more.
[38:22.22]There's another one.
[38:24.50]There's a part two.
[38:29.55]Is this Metal Gear?
[38:45.32]Nothing about this is good.
[38:47.42]Not one thing.
[38:51.84]I feel like I'm in a dream right now.
[38:54.26]I'm dreaming this whole thing.
[39:00.82]What a gamer.
[39:04.88]What?
[39:05.62]What a god of a gamer.
[39:08.26]Seriously.
[39:09.30]I gotta wake up, man.
[39:10.72]I gotta wake up.
[39:12.66]I gotta wake up.
[39:16.96]Wait, hold on.
[39:18.56]So was that all from... Look at this fucking face.
[39:21.62]Look at this.
[39:23.74]Look at that crazed look.
[39:25.26]My god.
[39:27.90]This is not this guy.
[39:30.27]You know what I mean?
[39:31.05]Look at this guy right here.
[39:32.03]I look like Woody Harrelson's son.
[39:36.73]This is not the same person.
[39:41.61]Alright.
[39:43.09]Was that all from Half-Life?
[39:49.36]Rindelwald.
[39:52.88]I don't even, I haven't even seen that movie and it's making me laugh.
[39:55.78]Alright, this is called jermaTV.
[39:57.98]Metal Gear Solid 2.
[39:58.56]Here we go.
[40:03.20]So I think the thing about, um, I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[40:08.40]Holy shit!
[40:09.62]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[40:11.18]That's interesting.
[40:12.64]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[40:16.09]Okay, he landed.
[40:20.09]Ooh, up in smoke.
[40:24.95]Hey, you got a cystic.
[40:27.19]I don't like this part.
[40:29.41]A little bit further.
[40:31.05]You're probably right.
[40:37.33]Alright.
[40:42.31]Go to the end.
[40:43.65]Go to the end.
[40:48.39]I'm not even in there correctly.
[40:51.33]Just got to keep our eyes open.
[40:53.15]Go to the end.
[40:54.03]Go to the end.
[40:58.93]Go to the end.
[41:01.00]Whoa.
[41:01.30]I got this.
[41:01.92]Absolutely perfect.
[41:05.86]Are you in charge of this?
[41:07.63]Turn it up.
[41:09.13]I would.
[41:09.53]I am.
[41:09.83]Shut this off.
[41:10.29]Shut them all off.
[41:11.51]Turn your lights in your house off too.
[41:13.47]I would if I could.
[41:14.75]I can't turn it off.
[41:15.85]This is called who who don't you.
[41:17.29]I'll skip it.
[41:18.43]I'm going to skip it if it does it.
[41:19.59]Oh, reenact the dome video.
[41:22.07]Two, three.
[41:27.01]Alright.
[41:27.35]Alright.
[41:27.81]Alright.
[41:28.21]Alright.
[41:28.55]Fine.
[41:28.91]Fine.
[41:29.45]Oh, reenact the dome video.
[41:33.36]Nope.
[41:33.80]I'm not doing that.
[41:35.32]I'm going to give you a chance.
[41:39.36]This is Jerma- Super Jerma 64.
[41:40.58]That's my favorite game.
[41:48.89]That same stupid fucking run.
[42:15.50]I was just walking back.
[42:16.60]Can I make the jump?
[42:17.70]Come on, I can make this jump.
[42:23.89]Wrong way.
[42:24.61]Hey, Mom!
[42:27.01]Mom, I see it!
[42:27.71]Yeah, wow!
[42:45.14]What a gamer.
[42:47.88]That was great.
[42:49.32]Just pointing to it and touching it.
[42:52.32]That was amazing.
[42:57.34]That's it.
[42:58.93]Come on, next we got Jerma.
[43:00.27]Yes, who runs into a window.
[43:01.83]Oh, that's my team's picture.
[43:03.55]Leave it to me, Shiosuke!
[43:15.17]It's called Watch Out Turbo.
[43:32.31]When did I do this?
[43:33.73]Wait, hold on a second.
[43:34.83]When did I do this?
[43:35.75]I don't remember doing this.
[43:38.59]When the fuck did I do this?
[43:40.61]This is really good.
[43:44.54]What?
[43:44.72]This is fucking fantastic!
[43:46.18]When did I do that?
[44:06.52]Wait, what?
[44:09.14]Hey.
[44:09.46]Dave, right?
[44:10.92]Hey, welcome to Lyft.
[44:15.27]I don't understand.
[44:16.75]Was that?
[44:17.05]Yeah.
[44:19.31]No, I've been, um... Yeah, I've been driving for, like, probably a couple years now on Lyft.
[44:25.87]Right.
[44:28.75]Hold on.
[44:39.59]We're led to believe that I moonwalked out of the stadium.
[44:46.39]Alright, so here we are.
[44:47.07]We're at Persona 985.
[44:47.99]Here's this next one.
[44:58.12]I don't understand.
[44:58.86]I've never played this.
[45:03.92]Is that Auto?
[45:09.63]Holy shit.
[45:14.37]Auto leveled up.
[45:16.50]That's my persona.
[45:16.96]33-year-old Jerma985 defeats high school student in dance-off.
[45:18.90]Oh, man.
[45:57.23]That guy tagged in his absolute form.
[46:03.19]Wait, what is this?
[46:04.41]This is the thing I'm talking about.
[46:10.58]I've told you guys this before.
[46:13.57]Absolute perfection.
[46:16.07]No ifs, ands, or buts.
[46:18.07]This right here is absolute perfection.
[46:23.96]Whoa!
[46:24.76]Easy!
[46:26.20]Easy!
[46:28.58]Oh!
[46:28.82]Dharma teaches karate.
[46:36.49]What is it?
[46:36.87]Karate.
[47:24.03]oh god no oh my god oh my god oh my god holy shit
[47:54.22]That was fucking insane.
[47:58.60]By the way, like, I was muted that whole time, just laughing my ass off.
[48:02.76]Because, like, I'm teaching karate, right?
[48:06.42]Teaching karate.
[48:07.78]That's me teaching karate.
[48:08.74]What is this, like, energy shit that I'm doing with my hands?
[48:11.70]I'm like that guy that, I will be able to stop you with energy!
[48:15.42]And then the guy got, like, punched in the face or something, whatever it was.
[48:20.90]Oh my god.
[48:23.37]Don't mute.
[48:24.01]I had to.
[48:24.63]I was going to ruin the video.
[48:27.45]I had to mute.
[48:28.35]It was going to ruin everything.
[48:29.49]I would have just like been screaming over that whole thing.
[48:36.18]That was so fucking insane.
[48:38.26]Alright.
[48:38.68]This one's called Jerma Meme.
[48:40.90]Okay.
[48:44.40]I don't want to like ruin all these videos.
[48:46.68]Jerma Meme.
[48:48.91]Okay.
[48:49.31]Go to youtube.com.
[48:50.11]Alright.
[48:54.13]I'm going to search.
[48:57.47]Searching for... Sword Art Online.
[49:03.23]Episode 1.
[49:03.81]Okay.
[49:07.46]I don't understand.
[49:09.76]You really fucking watching this shit?
[49:17.16]Please.
[49:19.36]Oh my god!
[49:24.40]That's- you're just searching for sword art online?
[49:28.38]What's- what?
[49:29.02]I don't understand.
[49:32.23]Now what- what are you doing now?
[49:33.79]Are you gonna listen?
[49:42.31]What is this?
[49:43.03]Turn it off.
[49:45.79]Are you in charge of this?
[49:47.81]Do I need to skip this one?
[49:49.41]Get the shutters off.
[49:50.17]Shut them all off.
[49:51.39]Turn your lights on your house off too.
[49:53.68]Oh my god, what can I... Well, whatever.
[50:00.03]I don't know what it is.
[50:01.97]Hey, look, it's JermJerm's Bizarre and... Oh, that's loud.
[50:15.56]JermJerm's Bizarre Adventure.
[50:24.60]I wonder out of the 300 plus submissions, how many of them are JoJo related? 75%.
[50:57.31]A lot of work went into this one.
[50:59.67]This is a lot of work.
[51:15.97]What the hell was that with the binoculars?
[51:26.93]I mean, this was not just thrown together.
[51:28.53]This was like some real work here.
[51:29.87]What was the intro?
[51:32.27]Hey.
[51:34.43]Here's what I have to say about this.
[51:35.89]Fallout 76.
[51:36.27]See this bullshit?
[51:37.37]Get out of here.
[51:48.10]All the single Joe.
[51:49.44]All the single furries.
[51:50.56]Oh, God.
[51:50.92]What happened?
[51:51.22]All the single furries.
[51:52.06]All the single furries.
[51:53.30]All the single furries.
[51:54.34]This is the thing I'm talking about.
[51:59.96]Absolute perfection.
[52:00.94]What is happening?
[52:01.76]No ifs, ands, or buts.
[52:04.04]Skip it.
[52:04.47]I can't skip it.
[52:06.73]Absolute perfection.
[52:10.33]The next one's called Birthday.
[52:12.17]Birthday.
[52:14.09]The next one's Birthday.
[52:15.09]Yeah, why would you look over and smile?
[52:19.30]Okay, Birthday.
[52:20.02]It's getting closer.
[52:29.67]Another JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[52:41.36]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[52:42.74]Jerma here.
[52:43.91]With sort of a different video today.
[52:46.05]I apologize if I sound a little nervous.
[52:48.19]Because I am.
[52:48.83]I just found a wild shpee nest on Dustbowl.
[52:53.83]And this is, they pop up from time to time.
[52:55.47]But I've got to be really careful here, guys.
[52:57.87]This is the middle of mating season.
[52:59.52]Blue shpees and red shpees are going to be mating.
[53:02.62]Got to be very, very quiet here.
[53:05.96]Oh, shit.
[53:09.16]Oh, shit.
[53:09.64]Does he see me?
[53:11.78]God, thank fucking God.
[53:14.97]That would have been very bad.
[53:17.39]He's saying it.
[53:18.27]He's saying the word.
[53:19.25]I don't like how they're reacting to this, though.
[53:20.79]I don't like how... Oh, God.
[53:22.55]Oh, God.
[53:22.85]Just run.
[53:23.15]I gotta get out of here.
[53:24.49]Oh, no.
[53:25.01]They're killing each other.
[53:26.15]What's your name?
[53:26.90]I'm gonna die.
[53:27.94]I'm gonna fucking die here.
[53:28.72]What's your name?
[53:29.48]Hi.
[53:29.62]Hi.
[53:29.80]Hi, my name's... The Jerva Perry is this one.
[53:31.66]I don't want you.
[53:32.68]I don't want you.
[53:40.14]I don't want to fight you, man.
[53:58.98]I don't want to fight you.
[54:07.18]Oh, no!
[54:08.48]Turma goes west.
[54:16.44]You're a scientist.
[54:19.09]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[54:23.67]What is it with Willow Elvinson as Dr. Mosquito?
[54:29.62]Twitch chat as Lash.
[54:34.94]Ah!
[54:36.04]Nuclear war has nearly destroyed our planet.
[54:39.87]Now...
[54:50.31]What is this?
[54:54.97]What is this fucking video?
[54:56.69]I don't know what this video is.
[55:01.19]Alright, going for the low-hanging fruit.
[55:09.01]Low-hanging fruit.
[55:14.51]Wait, hold on.
[55:14.93]Did this get through the meme shit?
[55:18.19]Hold on.
[55:18.97]I didn't want it to be too meme-y tonight.
[55:21.67]Is this a... Was this a meme?
[55:24.93]Was this a meme?
[55:27.15]Did a meme get through?
[55:28.08]Hold on.
[55:29.50]Did a meme just get through?
[55:30.60]Oh, God damn it.
[55:37.18]A meme.
[55:38.98]Whatever.
[55:42.71]Alright, this is called... Fuck.
[55:47.98]I don't know what that is.
[55:48.80]I don't know what that meme is.
[55:52.01]Everyone keeps saying it and I'm too much of an old man.
[55:55.03]Alright, here we go.
[55:56.41]Welcome to Lyft.
[55:56.99]Hey.
[56:00.17]Dave, right?
[56:01.63]Hey, welcome to Lyft.
[56:02.61]So you're from here?
[56:11.32]Yeah.
[56:11.72]I grew up here.
[56:14.86]I know all the secrets.
[56:15.70]Don't, like, turn off your GPS.
[56:17.50]I know where I'm going.
[56:20.96]This is a pretty good car.
[56:24.16]What's up?
[56:24.46]Yeah.
[56:26.75]No, I've been, uh... Yeah, I've been driving for, like, probably a couple years now on Lyft.
[56:33.27]Right.
[56:36.17]Yeah.
[56:39.61]Yeah, well, I moved here when I was probably 19 or so.
[56:47.50]Oh shit, sorry, yeah, sorry.
[56:51.30]It's a great place.
[56:54.22]Up next!
[56:55.20]Wait, what is this?
[56:57.44]What the hell is that?
[56:59.14]Fast Purple vs. Jerm.
[57:02.03]Purple Alien.
[57:02.91]Purple Alien.
[57:07.79]Purple Alien.
[57:31.67]Applying battle chapstick.
[57:34.86]Okay.
[57:39.32]They arrive at the alien's home planet.
[57:42.68]An awesome battle takes place.
[57:52.61]Oh my god.
[57:56.05]It is unsettling to me.
[58:01.17]Wait a second.
[58:05.19]You know when there's like so much stimulation that I don't know what's real anymore.
[58:14.44]Alright, hold on.
[58:16.34]We've been doing this for an hour.
[58:17.44]Let's take just like a two minute state of the channel here, okay?
[58:28.03]Food break?
[58:28.57]No, no, no, no.
[58:29.29]We're just gonna chill for a second.
[58:32.11]We'll do... I'm curious as to... So we're about... We're probably like 20... 10 to 20% of the way through this.
[58:43.00]Ugh.
[58:44.92]I'm still... I'm loving this though.
[58:46.43]This is fucking fun.
[58:52.36]Alright, I just needed a second for us to flush all the memories, flush all the shit that we just saw into the brain toilet and put one of those Clorox toilet cleaners in.
[59:03.63]It's a fresh toilet, and here it comes.
[59:05.23]Here comes more, like, video poo.
[59:08.51]I don't know why I just made that.
[59:09.77]What the fuck am I talking about?
[59:11.61]I don't know why I said that.
[59:14.33]Look, my brain is scrambled right now.
[59:15.71]Okay, Jerma in an Ape Odyssey.
[59:20.29]This is from the movies.
[59:31.08]That's not me laughing.
[59:32.09]I'm not laughing, it's sort of... It's me from the past.
[59:41.61]It's the wrong actor!
[59:42.37]You got it!
[59:58.77]Jeremy Boston, CIA.
[60:05.26]What?
[60:06.62]Hey.
[60:07.86]How are you?
[60:08.24]How you doing?
[60:15.48]Gotcha.
[60:20.11]What is this?
[60:21.53]The car is sentient?
[60:23.17]What am I being followed by?
[60:24.25]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[60:31.19]Why am I going back and forth like this?
[60:37.13]Oh, shit.
[60:37.95]Make an English pullover.
[60:41.01]It's fucking Mr. B. No!
[60:44.39]Oh!
[60:45.47]Oh!
[60:50.27]What the fuck?
[60:57.16]Oh, no.
[60:58.00]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[61:12.54]Next!
[61:14.56]Yeah, Jerma versus a loading screen.

[69:55.84]That was fun.
[69:56.54]That was a fun one.
[69:58.02]That was a very fun one.
[69:59.80]Let's start at the beginning of this one.
[70:00.78]This is called Jerma Stellar.
[70:05.16]T-pose.
[70:15.19]Starting off good?
[70:19.29]That's it.
[70:19.73]Alright, that's it.
[70:20.41]This is called Shooting.
[70:20.95]Shooting.
[70:42.99]I made it.
[70:43.97]I made it wherever I was going.
[70:44.99]Alright, friendly- oh, here's another one of these.
[70:47.89]I moved here when I was probably 19 or so.
[70:51.61]I didn't even run anything over.
[70:54.73]Oh shit, sorry, yeah, sorry.
[70:57.41]I know, I know I've lost you, darling.
[71:09.16]I've been a fool to myself.
[71:18.92]I liked that last one.
[71:21.84]I'm in my living room right now.
[71:24.24]Here's JermaCraft.
[71:25.12]I do got a pretty sweet house.
[71:26.38]Way better than your Minecraft house, dude.
[71:57.71]The Jim Carrey.
[71:58.78]I forgot about the Jim Carrey.
[72:01.16]Jerma versus Jerma.
[72:01.86]This is called short.
[72:04.62]I wonder what's going to happen.
[72:05.46]That's Jerma.
[72:07.57]It's time for you to pay.
[72:08.89]Then here comes Jerma.
[72:09.69]It's Jerma985.
[72:10.53]I don't want to fight you.
[72:12.87]I don't want to.
[72:27.17]I'd like to solve the puzzle, please.
[72:35.93]Ow!
[72:37.19]Ow!
[72:37.35]Ow!
[72:37.49]What the fuck?
[72:40.22]I just shit my pants.
[72:41.74]I can't do it anymore.
[72:43.88]Shitty CG.
[72:59.26]Oh, I transformed!
[73:00.76]Oh, no!
[73:02.10]No!
[73:03.52]I can't even keep track of my hands!
[73:08.92]What?
[73:09.78]Bam!
[73:10.32]Not so fast!
[73:13.72]What's going on?
[73:17.28]What?
[73:39.65]Casting a spell.
[73:40.71]It's casting Zap.
[73:50.99]I think I popped a blood vessel in my eye.
[73:53.97]When the transition to Mortal Kombat.
[73:58.85]Hold on.
[73:59.05]I need a break.
[73:59.69]I need a break.
[74:01.19]Because I really think I just hurt myself.
[74:06.54]That smooth transition into the fucking Joss destruction from Mortal Kombat.
[74:14.91]Holy shit, there are 9,700 people here.
[74:22.00]I didn't even look.
[74:24.82]That last video was called... That's quite the thumbnail.
[74:29.34]Gerber versus Gerber.
[74:30.56]Short.

[74:43.47]That was fucking... These are so fun.
[74:46.57]You guys have severely, severely just crushed my expectations for how this was gonna go.
[74:53.28]I'll be right back.
[74:54.38]Grab a drink.
[76:48.27]Alright.
[76:53.11]I'm back.

[77:00.39]Alright, let's uh, let me just take a quick look at something here.
[77:06.57]Alright, we're going good.
[77:09.33]We're about we are just about like 33% of the way through and it's been an hour.
[77:13.53]So I think I think we can do the whole thing tonight.
[77:19.50]We almost got to 10,000 years.
[77:23.28]It's alright.
[77:23.84]I'm not looking to... If you're here, you're here.
[77:26.78]I'm fucking glad you are.
[77:27.61]Yeah, I gotta drink.
[77:35.33]I was supposed to drink wine, but the wine went bad.
[77:40.31]Here we go.
[77:41.09]This next one coming up is called Jerma Snap.
[77:45.86]I believe...
[77:47.98]I believe Infinity War spoilers coming up here.
[77:53.38]Just in case you didn't.
[77:54.04]The next minute here is going to... Just be careful if you haven't seen the movie where Thanos is in it.
[77:58.32]He's the main character.
[77:59.82]And there's a problem.
[78:00.86]Alright, just be careful.
[78:04.38]Here we go.
[78:04.78]Welcome back.
[78:08.11]Welcome back to Movie Night.
[78:09.63]Jerma Snap.

[78:19.38]And because of this, I'm going to do it with two hands, and everyone dies.
[78:28.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:29.94]That means me, too.
[78:30.93]No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[80:30.22]My name's Daniel.
[80:31.38]I know you've always wanted a daughter, but that doesn't mean you can treat me like one.
[80:34.64]That's just a big ol' sun, ain't it there?
[80:37.60]How could you say that?
[80:38.51]Oh my god.

[80:54.36]It's gonna be a hot one.
[80:55.56]That's right.
[80:57.06]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[80:58.48]What?
[80:58.74]Is that why you've always wanted a daughter?

[95:11.56]Yep.
[95:13.00]That's a little too high for me.
[95:17.26]What was the point of me putting the ladder in?
[95:20.02]Like I knew it was going to happen.
[95:31.33]Going again?
[95:34.47]Am I going?
[95:34.89]I'm going again.

[161:42.75]Same thing.
[161:43.03]It's another piece of meat.
[161:43.95]It's time for you to pay.
[161:50.63]The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[161:57.27]What a gamer.
[161:59.69]What a god of a gamer, seriously.

[163:16.56]One day ago today.
[163:31.68]I'm in the snow.
[163:53.76]The train's going by on the train tracks.
[163:56.08]What's the context here?
[163:58.68]You could leave this meme?
[164:01.06]It's a meme?
[164:01.62]I don't know what that is.
[164:10.39]That's Kirby with hair.
[164:22.45]I don't know what Kirby's doing here.
[164:24.97]I like the race car bit.

[165:16.27]Ideas worth spreading.
[165:23.19]Why do people do this?
[165:24.85]There's no reason to do what I'm doing right now.
[165:26.93]If you were falling, you wouldn't be going like this.
[165:30.78]You'd just be like... Why do we... What is this?
[165:42.13]Whoa!

[170:26.70]Look at me.
[170:29.75]Look at me.
[170:32.59]That's what you sound like.
[170:34.91]Right there.
[170:35.29]Bingo.
[170:35.83]Right there.
[170:36.17]That's the follow button.
[170:37.23]Click that.
[170:38.47]Every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.
[170:48.30]There's too much going on to even react to this.
[170:51.86]Having a cigarette is this one.
[170:55.32]Having a cigarette?
[170:56.74]Yeah, sometimes I like to smoke down here.
[170:58.77]I haven't seen that in a long time.
[171:05.89]Dermot's nap.
[171:10.31]I don't know what that is.
[171:13.37]You boy, don't step in there.
[171:15.67]No.
[171:15.73]No, you do it.
[171:17.23]You do it.
[171:19.76]I'm sleeping.
[171:26.64]Oh.
[171:32.38]You didn't even put the covers in.
[171:36.64]Mom!
[171:37.38]I don't want to step on that.
[171:43.83]Hey, Mom?
[171:43.99]Can I have a glass of water?
[171:52.29]No, no.
[171:52.73]Oh my god.
[172:08.68]That was it.
[172:23.30]We pass it at that.
[172:24.64]We pass it at that.
[172:29.25]The Weather Channel.
[172:29.85]Very smart meteorologist.
[172:30.67]Did not die to pinwheels.
[172:35.70]That's right, Diane.
[172:36.54]It's going to be a cold one this weekend.
[172:38.36]As you can see here, we've got some low pressure coming up through the mountains here going all the way down over southern New Hampshire.
[172:45.79]That's right.
[172:46.21]It's going to make its way down here across the Nile River there, and then it's going to wrap back around and come back towards Massachusetts.
[172:54.49]Which then, unfortunately, your Saturday football game is going to get potentially rained out.
[173:00.18]As you see, two, that's right, two cold fronts coming from here and from here.
[173:06.16]And it's going to be a breezy one.
[173:08.12]They're going to collide together and they may be a gosh darn tornado.
[173:12.04]So you better bundle up out there and make sure you have anti-tornado clothing on and anti-tornado hats because they might blow away.
[173:18.61]Diane?
[173:19.81]Yeah.
[173:24.12]I'm not so sure about that one.
[173:25.23]It's going to be a hot one.
[173:26.53]That's right.
[173:27.37]It's going to be a hot one out there, Diane.
[173:29.63]As you can see, look at how big that sun is.
[173:32.15]Look at how big that is.
[173:32.85]I don't even need to tell you temperature numbers.
[173:35.35]That's just a big old sun, ain't it there?
[173:37.96]And it's going to be shining across the entire U.S.
[173:40.26]of A. That's right.
[173:41.70]Sun here, sunshine over here, and even sunshine down here.
[173:45.50]Where you don't typically get it.
[173:47.22]If you know what I'm saying.
[173:48.52]So, bundle up out there.
[173:50.16]It's going to be a cold one.
[173:51.08]Every day is a cold one with the sun out there.
[173:53.62]What the fuck?
[173:55.97]What the hell am I talking about?
[173:57.25]I'm being forced to type these against my will.
[174:01.73]What?
[174:04.05]It's going to be a call with the shutout there.
[174:06.68]Jeremiah hates memes.
[174:10.56]Hate all his goddamn memes.
[174:14.04]Not against the truth there.
[174:15.06]How to kill meme.
[174:16.44]Now I can just kill... That's making me dizzy and I'm not even doing it.
[174:43.93]Jerma finally plays Far Cry 1.
[174:45.45]He's got like a Steam notification.
[174:52.39]You had to play Far Cry for this.
[174:54.16]Careful!
[175:13.38]You actually had to go into Far Cry and record this.
[175:17.22]Props to that.
[175:27.67]Oh, Jerma unlocks a power to rival the gods.
[175:33.47]Is this JoJo?
[175:35.21]Better not be.
[175:36.16]This is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[175:49.91]Oh!
[175:50.33]That was fucking loud.
[175:58.19]People have used that catch it line.
[176:00.76]Do you remember when he gets cutscene controls?
[176:18.83]Where did you find him?
[176:20.67]I'll bet.
[176:22.05]Let's get you up to speed.
[176:39.59]The Prophet of Truth's ships breached the lunar perimeter, smashed what was left of the home fleet.
[176:44.99]Terrestrial casualties from the subsequent bombardment were extreme.
[176:50.27]Truth could have landed anywhere, but he committed all his forces here, East Africa, the ruins of New Mombasa.
[176:57.03]Then they started digging.
[177:00.65]What about Halo?
[177:02.05]We stopped it, but only temporarily.
[177:04.49]Now the Prophet of Truth is looking for something called the Ark, where he'll be able to fire all the Halo rings.
[177:11.92]If he succeeds, humanity, the Covenant, every sentient being in the galaxy...
[177:19.69]The rings will kill us all.
[177:21.15]Hell, not again.
[177:23.83]Emergency generators, now.
[177:25.77]Shielding failed.
[177:26.59]They're down and charging.
[177:27.88]As soon as they're up, reestablish contact with Lord Hood.
[177:30.34]Let him know.
[177:30.80]You are, all of you vermin, cowering in the dirt, thinking what?
[177:37.75]I wonder that you might escape the coming fire.
[177:44.43]I'm just fucking annoying.
[177:48.17]I'm just really annoying.
[178:15.67]This is Jerma Wars.
[178:16.83]The meme awakens.
[178:19.41]Gonna have to take another break here in a minute.
[178:29.94]There has been an awakening.
[178:31.48]I can't even prepare.
[178:34.02]Have you felt it?
[178:35.48]I just shit my pants again.
[178:46.14]Hey, maybe he gets a few crowns if we're not advancing those enemies.
[179:19.33]I can't even hear it.
[179:22.20]I can't even hear it.
[179:26.82]I need to take a second, man.
[179:28.74]Like, I couldn't even hear what I was saying.
[179:32.86]God.
[179:57.67]Alright.
[179:58.51]Hold on.
[179:58.73]Give me one second.
[179:59.35]Let me see where we are.
[180:03.33]We got about... We have less than 200 more.
[180:06.66]I think that's supposed to be a small number.
[180:22.64]We got less than 200.
[180:27.57]Oh, gosh, don't worry.
[180:28.69]We got like, you know, 20, 30.
[180:29.93]No, we got less than 200 left.
[180:31.60]It's alright.
[180:32.06]We're almost there.
[180:34.96]Alright.
[180:43.22]I'll be right back.
[180:44.40]I got a fist.
[180:45.58]Every hour, we have to take a second to collect our brains.
[180:49.96]See you in like two minutes.
