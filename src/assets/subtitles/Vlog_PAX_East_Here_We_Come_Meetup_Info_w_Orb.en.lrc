[00:11.64]Keep the beat.
[00:12.24]Keep the beat.
[00:12.80]You gotta keep the beat, Orb.
[00:15.00]You had the beat going, too.
[00:16.02]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:17.05]Jerma here, and... What's up, guys?
[00:19.29]My name is Orb.
[00:20.61]IncredibleOrb.
[00:21.49]He just came in, like...
[00:23.46]What was it, like an hour ago, two hours ago, something like that?
[00:25.58]Two hours ago, yeah.
[00:26.40]Two hours exactly, but he's in my house right now.
[00:29.59]It's kind of weird knowing that.
[00:30.87]Like they didn't get that?
[00:32.33]Well, we could be in like outer space.
[00:34.27]This could be photoshopped.
[00:36.07]This could be editing right here.
[00:37.97]But we want to come to you with this vlog right now to tell you something very, very super secret, except it's not a secret at all because Orb already talked about it in his video like two days ago.
[00:47.07]Oh, did I spoil it?
[00:48.25]You spoiled it?
[00:49.09]My bad.
[00:49.35]He didn't spoil it.
[00:50.29]We're going to be doing a signing at PAX East Friday at 5 p.m., right?
[00:56.15]5 p.m.
[00:56.65]Okay, yes.
[00:57.25]On Friday.
[00:58.09]Friday at 5 p.m.
[00:59.11]The 22nd.
[00:59.81]The 22nd.
[01:00.69]Mark it on your calendar.
[01:01.53]If you're going to be at PAX, we'll probably see you there.
[01:03.99]Make sure if you see us to flag us down, yell at us, grab us, punch us, and make us say hello because we love to do that type of stuff.
[01:13.24]Are we auto-focusing right now?
[01:14.48]What's going on here?
[01:15.58]Also, probably should have mentioned this.
[01:17.24]It's going to be at the Machinima booth.
[01:19.30]Machinima booth.
[01:20.20]Machinima booth.
[01:21.16]They're usually every year at every PAX.
[01:22.94]They have a big booth with a huge M. You really can't miss it if you know where you're going.
[01:28.15]They're not going to miss it.
[01:29.27]No, they're not going to miss it.
[01:29.93]We'll be there from 5 p.m.
[01:31.21]until...
[01:32.53]I don't know.
[01:33.49]I have no idea how long.
[01:34.69]Maybe we have like 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour.
[01:37.05]I have no idea.
[01:37.41]We could be there all damn day, but it's probably something like 40 minutes or so.
[01:40.64]We'll tweet it out.
[01:41.40]We'll make sure you all know where it is.
[01:43.06]And we're not just going to do that on Friday.
[01:45.28]On Saturday and maybe even Sunday as well, we'll do an outside the event get-together.
[01:50.50]So people that don't even have passes that want to come by and say hello, get a chance to do so.
[01:55.87]That's true.
[01:56.33]Maybe we'll go to like a coffee shop.
[01:57.45]We'll go to like a burger joint, sit down, and we'll get to like watch Orb eat like a four-pound hamburger.
[02:02.73]Are you going to own up to this?
[02:03.51]Is that going to happen?
[02:04.29]Yeah.
[02:05.29]I have videos scheduled that are going to be going up as the event goes, and we'll be doing vlogs and stuff that'll go up on the day of.
[02:11.85]So you'll get plenty of content on this channel as well as probably his channel too.
[02:16.03]Yeah, there will be a lot of vlog stuff.
[02:18.27]I will do a vlog for every day of PAX.
[02:20.73]So you will see a lot of his face, a lot of my face, and a lot of our faces together.
[02:26.11]In a, you know, non-sexual way.
[02:29.36]I promise.
[02:30.56]Well, I wouldn't say... No, I'm just kidding.
[02:33.60]It will be fun.
[02:34.16]It will be a lot of fun.
[02:36.08]In before the comment section is flooded with you and I being like best friends.
[02:43.08]But anyways, guys, we'll see you all next time.
[02:44.64]Thank you so much for watching, and we'll see you at PAX.
[02:46.58]And Orb just made this really weird, but it's okay.
[02:49.06]It doesn't have to be weird.
[02:50.08]It's only weird if you make it weird.
[02:51.74]Alright, guys, but we'll see you all next time.
[02:53.84]And if you're at PAX, cool.
[02:54.94]If not, then there'll be content here, and I'll see you all next time.
[02:57.94]Take care, everybody.
[02:59.12]Later, guys.
[03:00.08]Bye.
[03:00.69]Bye.
