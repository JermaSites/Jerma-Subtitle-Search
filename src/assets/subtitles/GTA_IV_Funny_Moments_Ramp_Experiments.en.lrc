[00:02.11]Did we lose our Jello Whirlpool?
[00:04.46]I think we did.
[00:05.38]Oh my god.
[00:06.88]What?
[00:07.58]WHAT?!
[00:08.54]What?!
[00:11.02]Dude, this guy... Alright, listen.
[00:15.20]Listen, the guy... I tried to open the door of that car, and the guy was on, like, drugs.
[00:21.11]He hit his arms.
[00:23.25]His arms.
[00:24.61]Who's shooting me?
[00:27.05]The cops are underwater.
[00:29.55]I can't even explain what just happened.
[00:32.05]Guy was like shit-faced.
[00:34.39]And then you plowed into me.
[00:35.63]He wouldn't get out of the car.
[00:36.83]He would not get out of the car.
[00:39.53]He was looking at me like, he was like, Oh, I found a helicopter over here.
[00:46.81]I've got a helicopter chasing me and I've only got one star.
[00:50.08]I kind of overshot that.
[00:51.64]How did I die from that?
[00:52.52]It's going to be a break.
[00:53.71]I'm gaining speed right now, and I'll just be ahead of you.
[00:57.25]I'm going to try and line this up.
[00:58.96]If I can land on top of you, dude, this is going to be so funny.
[01:01.78]That's what I had in mind.
[01:04.52]I am turning around.
[01:05.54]I am driving.
[01:07.84]I'm going now.
[01:14.03]There we go.
[01:15.43]Drive right into me.
[01:16.83]I'm going to jump at the right time.
[01:17.99]Anyone ride with me?
[01:20.42]I want to ride with you.
[01:21.46]I've got a sweet car.
[01:23.00]Let's go.
[01:23.50]Yeah, sure.
[01:23.82]I'll ride with you.
[01:25.16]Let's meet up.
[01:26.05]I've got room for... Oh, whoa!
[01:27.67]Hey!
[01:28.53]There goes his propeller.
[01:32.79]How did you get that?
[01:33.63]I don't know.
[01:35.27]This was nearby.
[01:36.98]He happened upon it.
[01:38.90]Alright, so the goal here is to try to hit me across all the water.
[01:43.58]Okay.
[01:43.90]Okay?
[01:46.48]How about all three stand on there?
[01:48.57]Yeah, all three of us stand on here.
[01:50.57]Oh my god, this is gonna be ridiculous.
[01:52.13]Okay, let me just- Jump, run- I thought you fell off.
[01:56.85]Alright, Alex, don't come yet.
[01:58.49]This car goes so fast, I don't know if I'll be able to, like, control it to hit you guys.
[02:04.20]What's our, like, band name?
[02:05.76]Because we definitely look like a boy band.
[02:07.30]Oh dear god.
[02:09.61]Are you serious?
[02:12.20]Are you all ready?
[02:13.64]Very, very ready.
[02:14.81]The question is, are you ready?
[02:17.50]I don't think I am.
[02:19.08]I'm having to dodge so much traffic to get down there, it's gonna be almost impossible to go in a straight line.
[02:22.69]There seems to be a car, right in the way, actually.
[02:24.39]Let me, like, shoot him to make a move.
[02:26.01]Oh, this car?!
[02:27.17]You mean this car?!
[02:29.17]What?!
[02:32.75]I thought you were completely pissed off.
[02:34.63]Because I rammed into the car that was in the way.
[02:37.74]Oh, Etalyx.
[02:39.78]Do you need some help getting back up?
[02:41.72]Yeah, just shoot me.
[02:43.48]Oh, no problem.
[02:45.28]Oh, jeez!
[02:48.96]There's just more and more cars stopping in the middle of the road and people are running away.
[02:53.38]Um, we might- this might already happen.
[02:55.40]This cop car might- no, never mind.
[02:57.67]Whoops.
[02:58.43]Oh, nice, like, barricade I made there.
[03:00.03]Sorry about that.
[03:00.75]That was just a bad RPG right there.
[03:03.79]There's soap, there's- okay, maybe you can get through now.
[03:05.79]Yeah, you can get through now.
[03:07.11]Yeah, see?
[03:08.19]I had that planned.
[03:09.63]Oh, shot that cop in the head.
[03:11.89]Oh, what about this guy right here?
[03:12.93]Look at that cock in right there.
[03:15.46]Alright, let's just kill ourselves.
[03:18.58]Just kill ourselves, because we need to test this stuff.
[03:22.40]Oh, sorry, Tim.
[03:26.43]Really, cop car?
[03:27.59]Really?
[03:27.87]Alright, get rid of your stars.
[03:32.23]I can't find a good car.
[03:33.81]Get this cop car.
[03:34.47]There's a cop car over here, like, sitting in the middle of the road.
[03:37.33]I want a good car.
[03:37.89]These cops don't even know what's about to happen.
[03:39.43]This cop wants to come for the ride.
[03:41.11]I need to get killed so that I can, uh, lose my life.
[03:43.49]No!
[03:43.71]Why did you do that?
[03:47.13]Wait, no, I found a car.
[03:48.43]Your job is to move these cop cars now.
[03:52.18]Oh, you just died.
[03:55.00]And now there's two cars in the way.
[03:56.50]Look at all these policemen running around us.
[03:58.76]They just, they want first-growth seats.
[04:00.66]Let me get these out of the way.
[04:01.70]I'll sacrifice myself again to, uh,
[04:04.47]See, these police officers, we just got off, like, parole, and they are just waiting for us to commit a crime.
[04:09.78]Yeah, Brett was, like, wasting no time doing that.
[04:12.66]I didn't know.
[04:13.14]I did nothing.
[04:14.66]That's fine.
[04:15.20]Don't worry about the cops.
[04:16.10]Like, they're not angry.
[04:17.26]There's no cars in the world.
[04:18.74]The cars are good?
[04:20.05]Yeah, the cars are good.
[04:20.83]Alright, we've got a bunch up now.
[04:22.77]Oh, for God's sake.
[04:24.47]The red one just parks.
[04:26.19]Yeah, what?
[04:26.95]Get this bitch out of here!
[04:29.03]Oh, wait.
[04:29.61]She's gone.
[04:30.37]Please, please turn.
[04:31.37]Are you serious?
[04:34.83]Lady!
[04:35.49]Lady, just go!
[04:37.29]Oh, you're good.
[04:37.85]Thank God!
[04:38.89]Alright, Etalyx.
[04:40.23]On your cue.
[04:40.53]Alright, I'm backing up into position.
[04:43.00]Uh-oh.
[04:45.62]Make sure you try to jump when he gets over here.
[04:47.58]Like, this car has little to no handling, so... It's gonna be awkward, but I'll try.
[04:54.39]Oh, this is gonna be a complete disaster.
[05:00.89]Right, if anyone survives this, I will pay you such good money.
[05:05.25]If anybody survives and lands on the other side of the river, you get killed.
[05:09.85]Is that Alex?
[05:10.65]The goal here.
[05:11.43]Oh, that's Alex.
[05:12.35]Oh, here we go, here we go, here it comes.
[05:13.77]Jump!
[05:14.99]I'm still alive!
[05:16.65]I'm alive!
[05:20.86]I think I missed Boo.
[05:22.64]No, you hit me.
[05:23.74]You hit me.
[05:24.20]No, I hit him.
[05:25.72]You hit me in my toe.
[05:29.56]This is where I ended up, Gemma.
[05:32.08]Right here.
[05:34.82]I did a cartwheel.
[05:35.66]I see.
[05:36.02]Alright, let's do that one more time.
[05:45.69]Take two.
[05:47.29]And hold down C. Make sure you're lined up with the jump.
[05:51.65]Oh, down there.
[05:52.55]Okay.
[05:53.60]And if you hold down C, you can look behind you.
[05:56.12]This is going to look so stupid.
[05:58.98]We're, like, running away for dear life, and then the ramp, we jump off as he arrives, but it's just too late.
[06:03.87]Let me tell you how badly this is not gonna work.
[06:06.59]Oh, this is not gonna work at all, but one of us could get lucky.
[06:09.85]Because you're, like, holding... Because you're in the middle, if you, like, hold C, it looks like a really bad boy band album cover.
[06:15.47]It really does.
[06:17.55]Yeah, we're the white berets.
[06:19.75]White hats.
[06:21.94]That's not him, yeah.
[06:23.30]I think that's him.
[06:24.42]No.
[06:25.52]Why do we all have white berets?
[06:27.23]Oh, that's definitely him right there.
[06:28.57]Run.
[06:28.77]Uh-oh.
[06:29.17]Here we go.
[06:29.89]Run.
[06:31.07]Not even close.
[06:34.41]Not even close.
[06:38.45]Oh, yeah.
[06:39.67]That's what I'm talking about.
[06:40.73]You completely missed me.
[06:43.09]I swear, on my screen, I hit all three of you.
[06:47.42]On my screen, Boo just got... Oh my god, Boo just got destroyed on my screen.
[06:57.77]Because I have an explosive round inside of my weapon right now, so... Wow, this is high jump.
[07:03.05]That's a helicopter!
[07:04.07]Oh crap.
[07:07.28]No, not my blades.
[07:08.10]Not my blades.
[07:10.76]Where are you guys?
[07:13.22]You know, Boo, I would get out and kill you right now if I didn't think the helicopter wasn't wonderful.
[07:17.45]Ooh, I want in.
[07:18.89]I'm gonna come to you guys, I'm gonna find you!
[07:22.47]Ignore the violent beeping.
[07:24.43]I'm sure it's fine.
[07:29.54]Where are you guys?
[07:30.24]Is there no room for Etalyx?
[07:33.68]Oh, that's a damn shame.
[07:35.42]Oh, damn it!
[07:36.44]Oh, crap!
[07:36.74]Oh, god!
[07:36.98]Oh, yeah!
[07:40.91]I believe I survived.
[07:41.81]Hey officers, how are you all doing today?
[07:43.81]I'm like completely fine.
[07:46.05]I think this- Alright well, let me fly this.
[07:48.53]It won't even let me in.
[07:49.38]Oh well.
