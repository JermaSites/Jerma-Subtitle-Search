[00:01.38]Hi guys.
[00:06.16]Let's talk about this.
[00:08.20]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
[00:11.51]I'm flustered already.
[00:13.47]And I haven't even started anything.
[00:14.63]A little ill.
[00:16.67]I've been feeling ill.
[00:17.49]I've been watching TV.
[00:20.57]But listen.
[00:21.45]I just found the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen on a computer.
[00:24.65]And it's on my computer.
[00:27.67]I own a computer and I found the worst thing ever.
[00:32.01]All the shit that I talk about.
[00:33.07]Oh, I can't believe this person has this.
[00:34.77]I can't believe this company.
[00:35.95]I have the worst computer case.
[00:38.30]I just found out why.
[00:41.24]In a moment, you'll find out.
[00:43.56]I'm going to tweet that.
[00:46.30]One second.
[01:27.07]Alright.
[01:29.56]So I, uh, as you guys know, I'm just your average Joe.
[01:33.80]I'm not a computer scientist, I dabble in it sometimes, I think it's fun to build them.
[01:39.66]But here's the issue.
[01:40.60]I got a USB cable, I have the USB front panel right on the top of my computer on the case.
[01:46.47]is USBs, four of them.
[01:48.88]And then next to that is this thing called the power button, where you press it and your computer turns on.
[01:55.22]Or if you hold it, you can force shut off your, everybody has a power button, okay?
[02:00.31]If for some reason, directly next to the left of the power button is a reset button, and it is touch sensitive.
[02:11.39]I didn't, I just found this out.
[02:14.05]I'm trying to plug in my USB from my fucking Xbox controller.
[02:19.67]And I like, slightly grazed this other little button right to the right of that slot.
[02:26.33]And my computer reset.
[02:29.30]What is the- what does that- what function is that?
[02:33.14]Why would you have a fucking Nintendo reset button on a PC?
[02:40.52]Is this a fucking Super Nintendo?
[02:42.25]Why is that here?
[02:47.51]To reset the computer, like to, no, it's a restart, not like a reset.
[02:53.79]That fucking thing, no, bullshit.
[02:56.53]Here's what that thing should be, okay?
[02:58.82]Shouldn't be a button that you can just like slightly graze and then, it's me, Mario.
[03:05.28]You're trying to turn on the fucking Nintendo.
[03:06.82]No, no, no.
[03:07.54]Have that be a hole where you can stick a fucking pin in, like a actual reset button.
[03:14.88]I can't fucking believe it.
[03:15.70]I turned my computer off.
[03:16.62]I was about to turn the stream on.
[03:18.72]My computer restarted and I had to set everything back up again.
[03:22.13]Oh, I was fucking flustered.
[03:30.45]Just don't press the button.
[03:31.65]What?
[03:31.87]But what?
[03:33.13]But why is it there?
[03:37.73]Fucking computer cases, man.
[03:40.17]The things that just goddamn plastic and steel.
[03:43.33]That's what people want.
[03:44.07]You don't have to add any frills.
[03:45.72]Just give me the good faceplate.
[03:46.94]And the things made out of goddamn plastic and glass.
[03:50.78]It's alright.
[03:51.22]You don't have to do like, what's that?
[03:52.14]Some fun buttons.
[03:53.06]How about this one?
[03:53.56]It's like the help button.
[03:55.36]My keyboard.
[03:56.65]You got a keyboard?
[03:57.55]Look down right now at your keyboard.
[03:59.13]Does it have a help button?
[04:00.47]Pry it off.
[04:01.35]With pliers.
[04:06.39]Tonight we're gonna play Celeste.
[04:12.48]As you can see on the screen right now.
[04:16.23]There it is.
[04:19.67]Jerma, are you okay right now?
[04:21.09]Yeah, I just couldn't believe it.
[04:25.23]I couldn't believe that I accidentally restarted my computer because I tried to plug a USB in.
[04:29.57]I hope you guys had a good few days.
[04:37.56]Haven't seen you guys in a little while.
[04:43.71]Was not supposed to be off yesterday.
[04:48.37]But I was feeling fucking shitty.
[04:52.36]Physically.
[04:54.14]And I really didn't think I was going to be able to sit here for... You know, three, four, five plus hours, so... But I should be okay today.
[05:02.18]I should be okay today.
[05:04.40]I mean, okay right now?
[05:05.58]Yeah.
[05:08.93]You can always tell my level of health...
[05:12.78]by the old person rant that I do at the beginning of a stream.
[05:18.72]And how many swear words were in it.
[05:22.12]So I don't know what this- I have no idea what this game's about.
[05:24.10]I know that it's... a game about... climbing up a mountain.
[05:31.35]And I know it's a platformer, and I know it's kinda like... in the realm of Super Meat Boy.
[05:36.09]Am I wrong?
[05:37.01]Is this completely- is this not even the right way to describe this game?
[05:45.11]Is this like Super Meat Boy?
[05:50.87]Kind of.
[05:51.95]Well, let's find out.
[05:53.61]What do you say?
[05:54.99]I have been told, Jeremy, you have to turn the music up.
[05:57.69]Otherwise, I'm leaving.
[06:00.27]So, we're gonna turn it down a couple notches.
[06:02.51]And let's get the sound in a good spot.
[06:06.01]Sounds about right.
[06:09.57]Alright, fine.
[06:10.23]We'll get it to a five.
[06:13.80]Six and a five.
[06:16.08]For the general average rating this stream is probably going to get by the end of the stream.
[06:20.84]From the audience itself.
[06:25.29]Now let's climb.
[06:27.95]Do I choose character?
[06:31.57]Assist mode.
[06:33.89]What should I do about that?
[06:35.27]Should I keep the assist mode off?
[06:37.49]Rename.
[06:37.93]Just keep it off.
[06:47.52]How about a series of numbers?
[06:54.01]Jax.
[06:56.07]Should it be Jax?
[06:59.17]I don't know.
[06:59.71]I've been feeling kind of ill the last couple days.
[07:01.75]I'm not sure if Jax is going to make an appearance.
[07:03.75]Jax is down in my lower intestine right now, hiding.
[07:10.93]Is there a mid-level Jax that we can try to figure out here?
[07:15.19]Because Jax is like super god.
[07:18.46]Jonks?
[07:22.30]Does that work?
[07:28.89]How about just John?
[07:29.79]Alright, Jonks.
[07:39.43]John.
[07:41.04]Just J-O-N.
[07:44.00]Jonks.
[07:46.88]Now, I think it has to be John.
[07:54.86]There's Jerma, there's Jax, and then there's John.
[07:58.69]You guys don't want John.
[08:00.39]Let me just tell you.
[08:01.59]If today's gonna be a John day,
[08:16.60]This is it, John.
[08:18.34]Oh man, I can already tell I'm gonna have problems.
[08:21.69]Just breathe.
[08:22.49]Okay, I'll listen.
[08:32.89]Should I breathe out?
[08:34.49]Okay.
[08:38.93]What's wrong with my computer?
[08:40.73]What is wrong?
[08:41.17]What's my computer doing?
[08:42.67]What's wrong with my computer?
[08:45.65]Whoa!
[08:47.49]What the fuck?
[08:53.90]I got a virus!
[08:55.34]There must be a virus!
[08:58.94]Alright, so press A to jump, press B to jump, press A to jump, press C to jump, press B to jump.
[09:18.40]Oh, okay, this is not... How do I read?
[09:25.28]Is there a fast run?
[09:28.56]If I hold down Super Meat Boy Y, hold LT to climb.
[09:34.06]And then press up.
[09:36.29]Okay, that's not bad.
[09:43.21]I will say, I'm... Okay, does right trigger do the same thing?
[09:46.17]It does.
[09:46.97]I would rather do right trigger.
[09:48.97]He's asking a question in the tutorial.
[09:51.92]What?
[09:54.48]No, just... Just relax, okay?
[09:57.24]Did you breathe?
[10:00.84]Excuse me, ma'am.
[10:03.06]Do you want me to do the... Do you want me to do voice acting here?
[10:07.76]The sign is busted.
[10:09.35]Is this mountain... Is this the mountain trail?
[10:17.92]You're almost there!
[10:18.62]It's across the bridge!
[10:19.52]Okay.
[10:22.78]Tell us about your driveway.
[10:28.54]The bridge collapsed and I nearly died.
[10:45.09]My driveway almost did you in.
[10:46.89]The mountain might be a bit much for you.
[10:52.45]Is Jerma doing the beeps?
[10:54.09]I don't know what... I have no idea what you're talking about.
[10:56.30]My computer's making weird noises, though.
[11:11.33]Well, if I'm an old bat, like, you can survive out here.
[11:14.33]Like, I think you'll be- There's no likes.
[11:21.76]Like, if I'm an old bat and like, why am I doing that?
[11:24.56]But you should know, Celeste Mountain is a strange place.
[11:28.28]You might see things.
[11:29.76]Things you ain't ready to see.
[11:30.88]Uh, you should seek help, lady.
[11:50.53]That lady just did a Super Mario fucking theme song!
[12:00.66]She's still laughing at me.
[12:02.92]Is the bridge gonna collapse?
[12:04.76]Of course it is.
[12:12.28]What?
[12:18.71]Shit.
[12:21.75]Dash.
[12:24.87]Ah, there's a dash.
[12:25.93]Okay.
[12:31.52]So X is dash.
[12:33.24]You can do this.
[12:36.57]I know.
[12:37.52]I mean, I know I can.
[12:39.38]You know you're talking to her.
[12:41.50]You're not going to draw on.
[12:44.87]So this is level select.
[12:48.39]Chapter 1, Forsaken City.
[12:49.60]Climb it.
[12:53.97]Click save and quit from the pause menu at any time to take a break.
[12:57.64]You resume from the same screen and you won't lose any progress.
[13:00.54]You know when a video game gives you the Wiimote take a break, son, warning that you're probably going to have to at some point because it's going to be hard.
[13:21.63]Okay, oh, I gotta change that one, because I'm used to holding down that X or square button for a fast run.
[13:30.06]It's just the platform of blood that runs through my veins.
[13:33.52]All of you know what I'm talking about.
[13:35.11]Holding down X, holding down Y to just the run.
[13:41.79]Oh, man.
[13:46.34]I'm good.
[13:52.10]I can go up or down.
[13:52.76]I'm just gonna jump.
[13:57.84]So what is that?
[14:00.13]Thousand points.
[14:04.01]I don't want- No, wait, I'm not down.
[14:07.03]Okay, I only got one- I only got- I only got one dash.
[14:10.99]And when you're- Okay, when your hair is blue, you've used your dash.
[14:13.55]That's a really good fucking high quality indicator.
[14:15.83]To know that you did it.
[14:17.41]Can I go down?
[14:19.13]No, that's not down.
[14:19.87]Alright, here we go.
[14:26.00]Alright, I figured it out.
[14:27.66]There are yahuas in this one.
[14:29.98]There are yahuas.
[14:30.90]Hmm, so, I could go, uh... So is it just each stage is a different Mega Man screen?
[14:50.71]Is that what I'm understanding?
[14:56.82]Straight up.
[14:59.66]Yes, basically.
[15:00.48]Okay, that's cool.
[15:03.20]What about down there?
[15:03.86]Is there a secret?
[15:05.64]Are there secrets in this game that I need to know about?
[15:07.19]I already figured out that there was, okay?
[15:10.55]But I need to know if there's other secrets.
[15:20.33]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[15:20.77]What happened?
[15:21.41]What's going on?
[15:24.07]You can only hold on for so long.
[15:25.63]Okay, I get it.
[15:27.83]How long can you?
[15:30.95]I'm holding on long here.
[15:32.59]Alright, I see.
[15:41.72]Nothing up in that little crevice?
[15:45.24]Really?
[15:47.90]Well, I guess we're just gonna go.
[15:52.58]I just got baited.
[15:53.82]So these things, I can get those.
[15:56.51]This is no jumping, and this is no dashing.
[15:58.35]Not allowed.
[16:00.41]Oh.
[16:03.15]Or it goes away, I get it.
[16:12.23]You're gonna give me a challenge here?
[16:17.31]Don't speak so soon!
[16:18.37]Don't speak so soon, streamer!
[16:26.67]He doesn't even know.
[16:28.97]Just wait until he gets to World 2.
[16:30.25]Let's get the fruit here.
[16:40.34]Oh, that hurts.
[16:48.95]Oh!
[16:51.47]Carefully crafted.
[16:54.21]Alright, so no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[16:55.45]I have a dash still.
[16:56.77]Just don't use it until right now.
[17:00.05]So what do I get for the, uh... The snow, the snowberries?
[17:08.36]Is there, like, an upgrade feature?
[17:16.88]It's an ending.
[17:18.61]Don't tell me the ending!
[17:19.59]I don't want to know the ending!
[17:22.95]Oh, here's the ending, by the way.
[17:24.85]Oh my god.
[17:27.10]What have you done?
[17:31.32]Uh, anonymous gifter.
[17:33.34]Anonymous just gave 20 community subs.
[17:37.56]Well, whoever you are, uh, thank you.
[17:41.70]Really appreciate it.
[17:42.66]That's a lot.
[17:46.86]That's fucking so much money.
[17:49.83]Thank you.
[17:51.07]And congratulations to all the people that got a community sub.
[17:53.59]You can now put emo to the chat and not affected by slow mode and you don't get any ads.
[17:59.17]I don't play ads on the stream anyways, but, you know.
[18:01.55]Alright, let's see.
[18:03.17]Can I look?
[18:04.43]Or should I just look around?
[18:05.43]Just explore?
[18:07.19]That's a death.
[18:08.92]Right?
[18:14.10]Ah, there's a strawberry over there.
[18:21.49]Pay to win chat.
[18:22.89]Uh-oh.
[18:26.65]It's a little puzzle.
[18:27.39]I'll figure it out.
[18:28.83]My brain is bigger than anyone's on Earth, so I can figure this out.
[18:31.83]I think I need to go the other way.
[18:42.49]Can I use this as a flap to...
[18:49.49]Oh, shit.
[18:51.13]Okay.
[18:52.12]So you can actually... There's physical fitness movement in this.
[18:55.66]Okay, I get it.
[19:00.32]So you can actually use that stuff.
[19:01.76]Cool.
[19:08.76]So that's a different little globe.
[19:14.38]Hmm, there's two of them.
[19:20.49]This is as big as this gets.
[19:25.03]He's in one of his moods, isn't he?
[19:26.65]What the hell does that mean?
[19:35.13]Oh, my God.
[19:37.25]Don't die again.
[19:37.85]No, don't.
[19:38.95]Oh, my God.
[19:39.65]I died again.
[19:40.85]I'm getting so angry at this game.
[19:42.28]Oh.
[19:43.10]Oh.
[19:58.60]Does it count?
[20:00.50]No, I gotta complete the level.
[20:01.56]Okay.
[20:07.97]He's happy now, but he won't be in a couple hours.
[20:11.11]Well, then we're just gonna have to play GeoGuessr.
[20:17.41]I feel like there's a way I can get this.
[20:22.72]I have to go down and around.
[20:24.93]Look, this is a Metroidvania.
[20:27.17]I'm gonna unlock another ability.
[20:32.97]Maybe not, hold on.
[20:37.51]I got it.
[20:43.65]Another 10 community subs.
[20:44.93]10 community subs from Ferj Fernandez.
[20:50.98]Thank you.
[20:51.88]What?
[20:53.22]Did I not get it?
[21:00.55]Huh?
[21:07.29]That's a speedrun feature, isn't it?
[21:08.71]I gotta get them both.
[21:10.39]In like five seconds.
[21:12.33]Whatever, this guy will tell me what to do.
[21:21.72]No, you've heard it already.
[21:22.72]I'm not gonna do it again.
[21:25.54]What a killer night for a hike.
[21:29.97]I guess so.
[21:33.31]Re-chat, re-chat, re-chat.
[21:35.65]No.
[21:38.51]Alright, fine.
[21:39.21]This place is so crazy, I kind of can't... It really is the same noise, though.
[21:42.47]I mean, you gotta give me credit for even fucking... Give me some credit here.
[21:46.52]I didn't fucking know that this was gonna happen.
[21:51.50]I had no fucking idea.
[21:52.50]I just... You can ask anybody in this house.
[21:54.22]I just said I'm gonna use this on stream today.
[21:59.23]But, I mean, it's my computer making that noise, so, I mean, I'm gonna use my computer on stream.
[22:05.37]Not the easiest climb, is it?
[22:07.39]But I guess that's what I was looking for.
[22:14.46]Well, that sounds pretty serious.
[22:16.38]I'm just happy to see another human in such a lonely place.
[22:18.74]It's the same fucking sound.
[22:21.12]I can't get over it.
[22:22.30]I'm not gonna be able to the whole time.
[22:27.46]I'm Theo, by the way.
[22:29.20]An adventurer from a far off land.
[22:34.81]Not much of a talker, are you?
[22:36.79]Mysterious lone wolf type.
[22:38.21]I get it.
[22:38.61]I just imagined some dark backstory for you.
[22:42.41]This is where I bring my souls.
[22:46.43]I'm thinking like a dex build.
[22:47.94]Maybe a little bit of endurance, some vitality.
[22:50.56]And then stack resistance.
[23:02.09]Look, there's a fire here, and there's an NPC in this little camp over there.
[23:06.16]Give me a break.
[23:07.86]Well, John, I'd say you've come to the right place.
[23:09.88]I'm freezing my toes off, but I can't imagine a better place for some quiet reflection.
[23:14.71]Maybe you're right.
[23:15.65]Wait, what far off land do you hail from?
[23:18.93]Well, my inquisitive compatriot, I doth hail from the mystical... It's gonna be, like, Ohio or something.
[23:24.11]The mystical, exotic kingdom of... Seattle, got ya.
[23:27.30]I wrote this.
[23:28.46]No, I did.
[23:28.96]No, I did!
[23:29.72]I did!
[23:31.28]No, I did!
[23:32.22]No, I did!
[23:36.04]Sounds like a special place.
[23:39.56]Hey, okay.
[23:42.49]Anything else?
[23:44.89]Why would an entire city be abandoned?
[23:47.79]I read that some megacorporation started building it, but then no one wanted to live here.
[23:52.69]I wonder why.
[23:54.47]My money's on a government cover-up.
[23:57.00]What a waste to build all this for no reason.
[24:01.36]At least we get to enjoy the leftovers.
[24:08.58]Alright, thanks for the loot.
[24:12.12]My meat boy instincts are making me just jump off walls.
[24:15.78]And it's annoying me.
[24:19.29]This is blocked.
[24:22.71]Hmm.
[24:24.67]Keep talking.
[24:26.45]Are you here to explore this city?
[24:29.19]Yeah, I have a thing for abandoned places.
[24:31.38]And I like to think of myself as a budding photographer.
[24:35.16]Oh, really?
[24:35.78]Cool.
[24:36.10]Do you have a blog or something?
[24:41.22]A blog.
[24:43.62]John.
[24:44.84]Everyone uses Instapix now.
[24:47.44]I'm Theo Understars, look me up.
[24:53.24]Instapix.
[24:55.98]This terrain's pretty tricky, are you turning back soon?
[24:58.90]Nope, I'm heading for the summit.
[25:00.88]I can really see the determination in your eyes.
[25:03.14]It's inspiring.
[25:03.96]If you say so.
[25:07.09]I bet you can make it to the summit too.
[25:10.37]Maybe.
[25:11.95]I don't really care about reaching the top TBH.
[25:16.53]Oh, but I heard there are some legit old ruins up beyond the city.
[25:20.96]Like 1800s legit.
[25:23.76]I know it's risky, but I have to see them for myself.
[25:27.60]I'm gonna do this one more time.
[25:31.02]What's that thing you say right before you do something irresponsible?
[25:38.23]Your
[25:41.54]okay let's whatever I don't know it's yolo I know it's yolo throw caution to the wind ah no that's not it I'm thinking of
[26:15.64]This game loses a full letter grade to that.
[26:32.07]Wait, but I gotta collect the gems!
[26:35.03]I gotta figure out how this works.
[26:40.96]Wait, hold on.
[26:43.42]Oh.
[26:43.94]That's all that does?
[26:50.51]Well, what's the other side do?
[26:53.41]Alright, so now... Let's go get it.
[26:57.65]Let's go to the right.
[27:03.62]This is open!
[27:04.46]There's a lot of ways to go!
[27:11.94]I missed a secret.
[27:13.00]Oh, I'm gonna miss them all.
[27:14.20]Don't worry.
[27:18.68]Ah, I did it.
[27:19.20]I did it, but I didn't do it.
[27:24.92]Secret.
[27:25.36]I don't see a secret over here.
[27:32.11]Ooh.
[27:34.71]How is he supposed to know that it is a secret?
[27:36.85]I don't know.
[27:37.93]How would I know that?
[27:43.96]I could see this, I could go that way.
[27:45.34]No, we're looking for just game completion.
[27:51.52]I can load this up later and YOLO into the secrets all I want.
[28:04.03]It's not just a watch, it's a symbol.
[28:07.79]Stop saying that!
[28:19.77]Are you beach ready?
[28:21.27]Uh-oh.
[28:32.36]No!
[28:32.80]Super Meat Boy, stop making me do things!
[28:34.58]I have no idea where I am.
[28:45.25]I hope I'm going the right way.
[28:52.13]Secret over there, right?
[28:54.83]I found it.
[28:55.95]See?
[28:59.90]Ah!
[29:02.20]Good thing I got the bevels.
[29:26.09]No, I need that.
[29:31.94]Ah, shit, I didn't need to do the dash.
[29:33.40]Maybe I did.
[29:37.22]Yes, I did.
[29:43.52]Good.
[29:44.69]I've got seven.
[29:46.29]Not gonna do it.
[29:46.81]Ah, okay, so I get to go.
[29:59.34]I gotta do it faster.
[30:00.90]I gotta do it fast.
[30:03.18]Meat Boy, stop fucking up my video game.
[30:07.06]Oh, Super Meat Boy, you made my muscle memory into Meat Boy.
[30:25.52]Fuck!
[30:25.98]I gotta go faster!
[30:26.76]I gotta let go.
[30:29.56]Switch to commander video.
[30:32.16]I'm trying to do a double jump.
[30:33.58]Oh boy.
[30:37.78]I had it too.
[30:38.48]I got it.
[30:38.84]That counts, right?
[30:39.46]No, it doesn't.
[30:43.50]I got it.
[30:43.90]Okay.
[30:50.93]I give you these Pac-Man fruits and I'm expected to get them all.
[30:53.95]You can't be expected to get them all.
[30:57.57]Maybe one.
[31:05.92]So what does this do?
[31:07.16]Okay, here we go.
[31:07.68]I figured it out already.
[31:08.50]Well, first try, guaranteed.
[31:09.80]No, no, I'm just kidding.
[31:14.52]Would've been... Oops.
[31:26.17]Damn it.
[31:32.46]Alright, got it.
[31:32.98]So I'm going to say at nine bandages that I'm not going to get anymore.
[31:38.91]Because I don't need them.
[31:43.21]Oh, I can't.
[31:52.04]Oh shit, did I get it?
[31:52.94]Does it count?
[31:53.58]It counts.
[32:00.42]Fuck whoops, I just was out of here.
[32:03.98]No, hold on Okay, so you can go up There's a Paid in-game currency right here.
[32:21.33]I was wrong.
[32:21.95]I did it wrong Did wrong again
[32:27.93]Okay, I'm gonna say up, over, left, meat boy, don't, meat boy.
[32:33.23]Okay, then down and up, side, lift up, up, boing, boing, boing, boing, let's go.
[32:39.78]Clown car joke incoming.
[32:42.58]I'm sorry to severely disappoint you, but I do not have a clown car ready to go.
[32:49.62]Not right now.
[32:56.51]Yet.
[32:57.51]Shit.
[32:58.27]Alright, where are we at?
[33:07.12]Can I go down?
[33:11.00]Might want to fix that, then.
[33:12.32]What, the clown?
[33:14.50]The clown car?
[33:16.84]It's probably in the closet already.
[33:21.01]Oh shit.
[33:22.47]I get it.
[33:27.00]No, I don't.
[33:27.56]I could just go around this way, wait for a charge up, and then I wanna see down.
[33:30.28]Oh, come on.
[33:32.92]I landed on the fucking shark teeth already.
[33:36.09]I was gonna say just do this.
[33:38.53]Oh, fuck, that was it!
[33:39.41]I had to just wait for the charge!
[33:47.26]Dermot, don't touch the spikes.
[33:50.30]Are you sure?
[33:55.97]Come on.
[33:57.19]It's not gonna work, is it?
[33:58.74]Oh, fuck.
[33:59.56]Uh-oh.
[34:01.84]Yeah, I can't.
[34:02.58]It's wrong.
[34:03.80]It's wrong.
[34:07.45]You have to land for the recharge to even happen.
[34:22.55]Alright, so then I gotta go dash?
[34:25.11]And what do I have to grab here then?
[34:29.76]Oh.
[34:30.40]Hmm.
[34:31.76]Interesting.
[34:38.20]Oops.
[34:42.68]Can I knock this down?
[34:44.30]Ah!
[34:45.20]I can knock this down.
[34:48.06]Ah!
[34:49.12]I can knock that down.
[34:56.65]But it has spikes on it.
[34:57.53]Grab the side?
[35:02.09]Apparently.
[35:02.67]What?
[35:04.45]I have to, alright, I gotta grab the side of that and fall down with it and then jump off of it.
[35:19.74]You know, fuckin' meat boy.
[35:25.44]I'm gonna get back over there first.
[35:30.30]Okay, we're good.
[35:39.22]Holy shit, I'm just spamming.
[35:41.14]What are you spamming?
[35:48.73]Ow, my head.
[35:49.47]Just hold on.
[35:50.01]Hold on, it'll do it again.
[36:00.33]First boss.
[36:04.66]I have to jump on his head three times.
[36:07.34]This memorial is dedicated to those who perished on the climb.
[36:09.86]Okay.
[36:16.36]So I've made it.
[36:19.74]Here's the top of the mountain.
[36:20.58]I plant a seed in there.
[36:22.12]And a tree grows.
[36:24.66]I'm exhausted.
[36:28.97]See?
[36:29.19]It's an orange tree.
[36:38.76]I'm not gonna use the automaton.
[36:41.54]This might have been a mistake.
[36:49.02]Ow!
[36:49.50]God damn it.
[36:50.58]I thought that just said game over.
[36:52.28]I was looking over here to my left and I turn and I'm just like, game over.
[36:57.02]Oh, okay.
[36:57.40]10?
[36:57.42]10 out of 20.
[37:09.93]What?
[37:10.17]There's so many more places.
[37:12.77]I had to do that.
[37:16.30]Only 10 berries.
[37:17.30]Yeah, because there's a million places to go.
[37:19.62]There's so many places to go.
[37:24.08]This is Chapter 2, Old Site.
[37:32.07]Nice automaton, dude.
[37:33.41]Thanks.
[37:35.09]I really appreciate that.
[37:37.52]Alright, give me a song.
[37:38.30]I'll do it right off the bat.
[37:39.08]I will first try it.
[37:40.60]First song I see in the chat.
[37:46.42]All Star.
[37:46.84]One, two, three, now.
[38:24.05]And all that glitters is gold.
[38:30.87]Oh, I have to press A.
[38:38.92]Annoying.
[38:41.72]Shut up!
[38:42.68]How dare you!
[38:49.63]I'm kidding.
[38:50.13]Don't shut up.
[38:51.33]So things are all weird now.
[38:53.59]Is there a secret message here?
[38:57.37]This... Me or more would be dedicated to those... It's just backwards.
[39:11.35]That's not how you do it.
[39:14.53]This is really pretty land.
[39:19.02]I can get up there.
[39:21.30]Look.
[39:22.98]There's probably a berry up there.
[39:23.98]No, I can't.
[39:32.29]Whatever.
[39:35.19]Move on, John.
[39:42.42]I like this place.
[39:45.32]I knew that eventually they condition your brain into thinking that falling down is bad.
[39:54.51]Falling down is good sometimes.
[39:55.63]What do I got down here?
[40:04.79]I'm gonna get this.
[40:05.53]This is the one I can see, so I'm gonna get this one.
[40:09.53]Or am I?
[40:09.93]No, I'm not.
[40:11.45]Around?
[40:12.73]What is this down here?
[40:17.65]I thought I was supposed to be climbing a mountain, not going... What the fuck did I just do?
[40:23.13]What?
[40:23.37]Okay.
[40:23.47]So I obviously have to go like this.
[40:33.91]Oh, alright.
[40:35.51]Alright, I figured it out.
[40:36.31]I got it.
[40:39.24]Up, down, and around.
[40:42.13]There's even more of this.
[40:45.03]I went a completely opposite direction of where I may have supposed to be going.
[40:57.46]Oh, fuck.
[40:58.08]Okay.
[40:59.14]There's a secret down there!
[41:00.18]How do I get back down there?
[41:02.82]How do I get... Look!
[41:03.98]I think there's a secret right there!
[41:09.15]No!
[41:10.61]How do I restart?
[41:11.33]Okay.
[41:14.03]Hit the reset button.
[41:16.66]I need to go down here, land on this, and then...
[41:36.35]Secret berry.
[41:40.57]Nice.
[41:42.45]That was cool.
[41:44.57]Ooh, there's a door!
[41:45.89]Alright, can I open the door?
[41:50.82]There's no way to open that door.
[41:55.56]How do I get out of here?
[42:00.12]Like that.
[42:04.80]is it a mirror whoa can I talk to the mirror alright well I'm not going to react to that apparently
[42:32.86]Whoa!
[42:33.80]Hold on, but I wasn't even ready!
[42:35.42]I needed to see what this was!
[42:37.98]I needed to... I'm so overwhelmed.
[42:41.56]That was... okay.
[42:43.76]What is going on?
[42:46.03]I can hold on to this thing and look down.
[42:48.25]See, the game... I already knew there was a secret down here, and the game gave me binoculars to see.
[43:05.11]But the thing is though guys, what the heck is in that cube?
[43:08.90]Epic just dropped it one day and we're all trying to figure it out.
[43:13.16]Does it give items?
[43:15.66]Does it hurt you?
[43:16.34]Can I go up through this?
[43:29.13]Ah, so you go all the way through.
[43:37.65]So no matter what trajectory you're going, you'll always pass all the way through it.
[43:41.86]It's good to know.
[43:42.98]Except I fucking ruined it right there.
[43:44.26]I have to do it again.
[43:46.64]Cool.
[43:47.06]Is this fall?
[43:48.30]Secret?
[43:50.63]Hey, thanks Fortnite streamer.
[43:54.55]There's so many directions to go.
[44:02.16]Oh, it turned... it turned him into jelly.
[44:04.44]I get it.
[44:06.28]It... uh... it Christmas-caked everything that was impassable before.
[44:11.24]Cool.
[44:15.69]Where am I going?
[44:17.47]There's a secret... extra secret tape over there.
[44:19.39]I don't know what that does.
[44:28.05]Oh, fuck.
[44:29.67]I just pancaked myself.
[44:30.76]Okay.
[44:32.53]So wait, I gotta go through now then.
[44:35.07]So I gotta go like this now.
[44:39.85]I can't see.
[44:40.75]I can't see.
[44:43.10]Oh shit!
[44:45.54]Oh no!
[44:50.42]What if, what, what the heck is even inside that cube?
[44:52.62]I don't know, maybe I should make 10 videos about it.
[45:03.17]So what is in here?
[45:08.32]B-side unlocked.
[45:12.61]Music track?
[45:30.07]Alright, I'm gonna give this game a couple of extra points for one reason.
[45:34.13]You ready for the extra point reason?
[45:38.10]Like right now you are, we're playing American football and I'm going for the extra point and like the knowledge I'm about to give you right now is the ball and you're leaning down right in front of it like as on the opposing team.
[45:50.08]And I'm gonna kick this ball, like you're like a foot away from the ball and I'm kicking it right into your face.
[45:55.85]This is knowledge.
[45:57.33]There's a lot of ways to go.
[46:08.34]How do I get that one?
[46:13.69]I need to go around and then drop down to get that one, don't I?
[46:18.73]Damn it.
[46:23.40]I have to go up and then down.
[46:38.66]But where?
[46:39.82]But where?
[46:41.74]Wait, this one right here.
[46:45.38]Wait a minute.
[46:47.08]How do I do this?
[46:59.31]And they said it couldn't be done.
[47:00.75]Hmm.
[47:06.21]But I want to get that other one too.
[47:11.55]How far will... Oh, this is too much.
[47:15.15]Did everything do this?
[47:21.11]No, I feel like that's the progression route.
[47:23.03]Hold on.
[47:29.77]What is this way?
[47:32.58]Nothing?
[47:42.45]Is there anything?
[47:43.15]Can I go out?
[47:43.95]I'm just curious.
[47:44.77]I just need to know.
[47:48.22]No.
[47:51.38]He's up there.
[47:52.34]Oh, hold on.
[47:53.72]Wait a second here.
[47:55.62]Hold on one gosh darn second.
[48:07.84]Can I get through?
[48:08.71]Can I get up there like this?
[48:09.81]Ow.
[48:31.77]You gotta go up.
[48:32.89]Okay, I get it.
[48:33.81]And then you have to go down.
[48:37.08]Straight up.
[48:37.58]Straight up again.
[48:38.48]And then down this way.
[48:41.30]And then across.
[48:48.94]John, darling, slow down!
[48:53.29]Who said that?
[48:55.99]This is progression.
[48:56.85]Ah, fuck it is.
[49:02.16]No, I'm simply a concerned observer You can tell they're evil because they have red eyes.
[49:11.23]Are you me?
[49:13.83]I'm part of you Why would part of me look so creepy?
[49:23.17]This is just what I look like, okay?
[49:27.14]Deal with it.
[49:28.72]Sorry, I didn't.
[49:31.72]Forget about it.
[49:33.56]I can't tell you what a relief it is to finally get out of here.
[49:36.92]But look, I'm worried about her.
[49:38.84]We need a hobby, but this... I know it sounds crazy, but I need to climb this mountain!
[49:46.08]You are many things, darling, but you're not a mountain climber.
[49:49.90]Not in a fucking million years.
[49:53.09]Who says I can't be?
[49:55.93]I know it's not your strong suit, but be reasonable for once, you fucking idiot.
[50:00.67]You have no idea what you're getting into.
[50:02.93]You can't even handle it.
[50:05.27]This is exactly why I need to do this.
[50:06.75]Okay, I'm done doing this.
[50:07.95]Are you the weak part of me or the lazy part?
[50:16.14]I'm the pragmatic part of you.
[50:18.26]And I'm trying to be diplomatic here.
[50:21.96]Let's go home together.
[50:30.30]Well, not anymore.
[50:31.12]Do I have to run away?
[50:36.51]Can I attack?
[50:39.21]Dashing doesn't do anything.
[50:41.21]I can't- Okay, I just tried the Goomba.
[50:42.59]Goomba doesn't work.
[50:43.21]What about the Skeleton?
[50:50.83]Oh shit, I'm running out of energy!
[50:54.26]Wait, I need that.
[51:02.36]Shit!
[51:02.68]I can get it.
[51:03.87]I got it already.
[51:04.45]Good.
[51:16.37]How do I get it?
[51:19.01]How do you get this?
[51:19.57]Can I break the wall?
[51:20.39]Uh-oh, fuck.
[51:26.35]How do I get over there?
[51:27.89]I can't get that.
[51:29.17]That's some secret.
[51:29.97]I'll have to figure it out, like, on a third playthrough.
[51:38.13]Go in the door?
[51:38.97]I can't go in a door?
[51:40.39]Door!
[51:49.88]Can't open that?
[51:51.82]Oh yeah.
[51:52.34]Let's go, let's go, let's go!
[51:55.28]What the heck?
[52:04.45]I thought I had to touch it again.
[52:18.15]I don't... Okay, hold on.
[52:19.19]I can do twice.
[52:19.77]I can do two dashes.
[52:20.66]I can go for the spikes.
[52:21.92]Alright, alright, alright.
[52:23.08]I thought I was going to die hitting the spikes there.
[52:34.59]You dummy!
[52:45.68]I had it the first time.
[52:48.04]Oh my god.
[52:50.27]Do you know what I wish I could see with this game?
[52:52.35]Definitely a speedrun.
[52:54.47]Okay, I fucking shut up and play.
[52:56.61]I'm doing so bad.
[53:09.52]No, fuck.
[53:10.70]I gotta get that one first.
[53:25.62]Oh my god.
[53:26.46]Alright.
[53:27.18]Hold on.
[53:27.50]I need a sip of coffee.
[53:33.01]You have to bait.
[53:37.55]And then dash.
[53:39.97]You don't get it all in one go.
[53:41.35]If I get a dash, fuck me.
[53:44.22]I'm literally just outplaying myself.
[53:45.80]I really am.
[53:54.91]You idiot!
[53:56.29]What do I do?
[53:57.05]Holy shit, I'm so stupid!
[53:58.52]What's happening?
[53:59.22]Slow down!
[54:00.36]What's wrong with me?
[54:02.04]What's wrong with me?
[54:17.43]What's wrong with me?
[54:19.30]Why is it three?
[54:27.88]You gotta go real fast to get this one.
[54:29.70]You know what I would love to see with this game?
[54:51.02]No, I have to get it.
[54:51.96]I have to.
[55:06.61]Wait a minute, hold on.
[55:07.77]There... Oh.
[55:14.03]So they're not chasing me.
[55:25.18]Now I'm unbeatable.
[55:27.86]You stay here for a second, and then... I already got it.
[55:31.26]What the fuck am I doing?
[55:32.04]I already have it.
[55:34.40]Alright, everyone just stand still.
[55:45.78]I just stared into the microphone.
[55:55.82]Yeah, catch me if you can.
[56:02.51]Please, God!
[56:04.13]What?
[56:04.37]Go, go!
[56:13.28]Come on, I don't know what to do!
[56:19.74]Pull?
[56:23.46]Holy shit!
[56:29.89]Oh, I had it!
[56:38.87]Oh fuck, alright, get ready, get up.
[56:49.20]I'm trying to do a double jump.
[57:03.23]Fall.
[57:03.83]Fall.
[57:04.31]Fall.
[57:04.75]Fall.
[57:05.25]Go.
[57:07.52]Oh, you stupid idiot.
[57:08.66]You deserve to be punched.
[57:10.34]No, you don't.
[57:27.78]You missed it, you missed it, but it's okay, you can miss it.
[57:32.08]Oh my god, I did it again and I'm shaking!
[57:45.33]I'm not shaking, I'm fine.
[57:55.88]Up.
[57:56.12]Go around.
[57:57.62]There's four of them!
[57:59.00]What?
[57:59.26]I thought there was only three!
[58:00.70]I... Three!
[58:01.80]What the... What's inside that cube?
[58:03.98]I don't think we're ever gonna find out.
[58:05.35]Damn it.
[58:11.73]I would've done it if I didn't really.
[58:15.68]We gotta wait for them all to go by.
[58:37.32]Alright, let's do it.
[58:38.76]Oh, fuck me.
[58:39.52]Alright, this time, wait till they all go underneath.
[58:51.15]Holy shit, what have I done?
[58:52.39]No, no, you gotta just... How did I do that?
[59:01.76]What do I grab?
[59:10.00]Wait, go back.
[59:10.60]Is there anything over here?
[59:19.56]Wait, should I go up?
[59:22.39]No.
[59:27.09]No other, like, secrets or anything?
[59:30.81]No.
[59:36.69]Oops.
[59:43.93]No, no, not more ways to go.
[59:45.41]There is another way to go.
[59:46.23]There's a secret over here.
[59:47.17]There's so many ways to go!
[60:00.31]Uh-oh.
[60:01.11]Now I'm in trouble.
[60:02.41]There's so much to do!
[60:08.51]I'm so dumb.
[60:13.01]You gotta go diagonal.
[60:17.86]Shoulda went through.
[60:18.44]Like that.
[60:20.50]Alright.
[60:21.38]Give me the berry.
[60:32.30]Know the secrets?
[60:34.14]Not that I can see.
[60:38.24]So much to do, so much to see.
[60:39.70]You know, what's wrong with taking the back seat, you know?
[60:43.30]Sometimes you have to.
[60:48.98]Nothing?
[60:49.88]What about over here?
[60:51.72]This looks breakable.
[60:57.71]Alright, we have a coin center.
[61:06.22]Answer the phone?
[61:09.46]Why am I doing this to you?
[61:10.56]What are you talking about?
[61:12.12]I'm just checking for secrets.
[61:14.36]What, I'm not allowed to check for secrets?
[61:17.68]John?
[61:18.88]Are you calling from a payphone?
[61:21.46]Yep.
[61:22.48]No, wait.
[61:23.14]You called me.
[61:23.74]What are you talking about?
[61:27.90]It doesn't matter.
[61:28.90]I'm in trouble.
[61:29.54]I'm being chased by someone.
[61:34.77]I don't really understand what's going on, but I know I'm in danger.
[61:36.97]I can feel it.
[61:41.05]John, you only call me when you're panicking in the middle of the night.
[61:44.49]You don't have to make up some ridiculous story just to get my attention.
[61:49.87]I'm not making it up.
[61:52.15]You always do this.
[61:54.35]Shh.
[61:54.73]It's alright.
[61:55.21]Calm down.
[61:55.95]I'm sorry, sweetheart.
[61:57.47]Talk to me.
[62:02.94]I'm climbing Celeste Mountain.
[62:04.16]I found this old mirror and it shattered, but part of me escaped.
[62:08.82]And... I'm dreaming, aren't I?
[62:15.66]John, of course you're dreaming.
[62:16.58]I haven't spoken to you in months.
[62:18.78]Why would I start now?
[62:21.40]Why am I even climbing this stupid mountain?
[62:30.93]I'm wondering the same thing.
[62:32.75]It's time to give up and go home.
[62:37.13]First boss.
[62:39.85]Thanks for playing.
[62:45.37]What, I didn't even do it?
[62:46.11]Wait, I have to do this?
[62:55.89]Now I do the real level?
[62:56.89]I have to do it again?
[63:06.28]Is it fall damage?
[63:08.74]No.
[63:16.22]Interesting, though.
[63:16.82]Look, can I go over here?
[63:17.80]I can.
[63:19.15]Okay.
[63:19.61]What is... I don't even remember his name.
[63:21.59]Uh, I... If you paid me $1,000 right now and told me to say this guy's name and you get $1,000 in cash, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[63:31.35]Um...
[63:38.53]Thane?
[63:39.47]Is it Thane?
[63:42.94]Hey John, you made it.
[63:45.92]Climbing up here was tough.
[63:49.60]But totally worth it.
[63:54.87]Just look at those ruins.
[63:57.79]I took so many great pics, wanna see?
[64:01.23]Tain?
[64:02.39]Is that why I'm thinking that?
[64:03.99]Because somebody said Tain last night?
[64:06.18]Last night?
[64:06.84]It's been like four days.
[64:09.10]I don't- my brain sometimes has problems remembering things.
[64:13.20]Oh, sure.
[64:16.04]Last night.
[64:17.70]I was sick, okay?
[64:18.68]I'm sick right now.
[64:21.07]Theo!
[64:22.01]There it was.
[64:22.71]Thane.
[64:23.23]I have two letters.
[64:25.29]And- no, three letters, actually.
[64:27.05]The T, the H, and the E.
[64:30.61]Maybe I'll finally hit a thousand followers with these.
[64:32.61]We need to formally commemorate this occasion.
[64:39.69]Take a selfie with me.
[64:40.76]I don't take selfies.
[64:41.98]I hate them.
[64:42.92]I hate pictures.
[64:44.74]I don't like pictures.
[64:45.62]I don't like selfies.
[64:50.40]Guys, a selfie is just a permanent looking in the mirror.
[64:53.12]I don't want that.
[64:59.15]Every selfie is just the way that you look at yourself in the mirror.
[65:05.47]You want like 400,000 of those on your phone?
[65:12.68]I don't know if that's such a good idea.
[65:17.46]Come on, it's easy like this.
[65:22.02]See?
[65:27.73]What's a regular picture of you, then?
[65:33.19]A photo.
[65:37.22]No, everybody does the same thing when they take a selfie.
[65:41.08]I'll show you.
[65:42.76]So, anyways, forget about how fucking bad this hair is today.
[65:48.06]And yes, I've got a Death Star t-shirt on!
[65:50.44]The Death Star!
[65:57.43]People have made jokes before about how my whole wardrobe is Star Wars related.
[66:02.49]I've just, over the years, I've just had this, I have probably 12 to 15 Star Wars shirts.
[66:08.11]It's bad.
[66:08.57]They're just so easy.
[66:11.72]Look, Disney bought Star Wars.
[66:14.62]So at this point, it's everywhere.
[66:17.56]You can't get away from Star Wars.
[66:19.04]So there's like a 10% chance that, 10% of your clothing has to be Star Wars related.
[66:23.14]Is it?
[66:24.42]Is 10% of your guys' clothes Star Wars related?
[66:29.09]Are you sure?
[66:30.17]Go into your t-shirts.
[66:36.31]Are we certain about this?
[66:40.25]Anyways, what's the guy's name, Thane?
[66:45.84]What was I just doing?
[66:46.72]Why did I turn the camera on?
[66:50.30]Oh, right, right, right, selfie.
[66:51.44]Okay, so when you take a photo
[66:54.94]You are locking away a memory, right?
[66:57.68]Because you want to take a photo and you want to make sure you preserve it and remember it.
[67:00.42]So, you know, you're like, oh, it's me and some friends.
[67:03.06]Like, okay, like... Cool.
[67:06.26]Okay, nice.
[67:06.66]You got it?
[67:07.12]Nice.
[67:07.80]Hey, remember that time we went to Las Vegas?
[67:10.22]Yeah, here's a photo.
[67:11.96]A selfie is just the way you look at yourself in the mirror.
[67:14.60]You go like this.
[67:17.76]Ready?
[67:18.48]You tell me how this is any different than any selfie you've ever fucking seen in your life.
[67:31.14]It's fucking stupid!
[67:32.81]Don't take him anymore!
[67:37.07]Need to smile?
[67:38.13]No!
[67:38.45]Nobody does that!
[67:39.27]Look!
[67:49.06]Yes, they do.
[67:49.54]No, they don't.
[67:50.90]Okay, if somebody links me one photo of a selfie of somebody smiling, I will eat a thousand dollars.
[67:57.26]Alright, let's fucking go.
[67:58.72]Sorry about that, don't worry, I won't post that one.
[68:05.42]No, it's alright, you can post it.
[68:13.10]It was a joke, it was a fucking bit.
[68:19.61]No, no, stop, that was, no more links, no more, I ban, links are banned.
[68:29.99]Also, one other thing before we move on.
[68:32.15]I know people are probably like, go back to fucking Celeste.
[68:35.00]But listen, why is it?
[68:38.58]Every picture I ever take,
[68:39.88]when I'm trying to smile, it's like pain.
[68:42.62]I can't do it.
[68:43.38]I can't fucking smile in a photo because it takes too long.
[68:46.92]Right now, I'm like, we're like having some fun.
[68:49.10]We're like smiling and laughing and stuff.
[68:50.60]It's like fun.
[68:51.12]We're having a good time, right?
[68:52.43]Well, I'm smiling.
[68:53.93]If I take a photo of me smiling, it always looks like this every single fucking time, no matter what I do.
[69:02.79]I don't fucking understand.
[69:05.35]Why does this happen?
[69:09.76]And even when I think it looks good, in my mind, I'm like, oh, alright.
[69:13.84]Like, hey, this is fun.
[69:15.12]We're having a good time.
[69:18.91]And I look at the photo, and I zoom.
[69:20.41]Everybody does this.
[69:20.97]You zoom in.
[69:22.49]Hey, can I see that for a second, dude?
[69:24.11]Let me see.
[69:24.43]Like, you took a photo.
[69:25.21]You took, like, a group photo.
[69:26.41]Let me see.
[69:26.69]Let me see how it looks.
[69:27.91]Let me see my fucking face.
[69:30.96]God damn it.
[69:36.58]Don't be so hard on yourself.
[69:37.54]Okay, fine.
[69:38.06]I won't.
[69:44.34]No one looks good without a filter.
[69:48.26]It's true.
[69:51.29]Show the automaton.
[69:56.39]Me on the right, yeah.
[70:00.61]Casual, yet refined.
[70:03.06]Any more things this guy needs to tell me?
[70:04.80]What made you want to try photography?
[70:06.34]My grandpa was really into it.
[70:10.25]Apparently, do it again, I wasn't looking.
[70:11.45]You lost your opportunity.
[70:12.33]Rewind 15 seconds.
[70:14.06]Apparently he was semi-famous in the photography world.
[70:16.42]I don't know if I'll ever be that good.
[70:19.32]But it's nice to feel close to him.
[70:22.69]So you're determined to climb the entire mountain.
[70:27.63]Yeah, I told myself I would.
[70:28.75]I'm done breaking promises to myself.
[70:32.63]And the stream.
[70:34.20]I've told you Dreamcast is coming for like six months.
[70:36.84]And I keep telling you, oh, we're gonna do that like next weekend.
[70:38.74]And I keep breaking it.
[70:39.90]I gotta stop doing that.
[70:42.22]Life goals, I dig it.
[70:43.92]I doubt I'll make it to the top like you, but I'm not ready to turn back just yet.
[70:49.48]Are you getting any data up here?
[70:52.36]I don't have a smartphone.
[70:55.13]John, I don't even know how to respond to that.
[70:57.45]Alright, bye.
[71:04.14]How do I, like, jump and, like, karate kick the support of its tent?
[71:07.97]And have it, like, never mind.
[71:09.19]That's mean.
[71:10.77]Well, let's go.
[71:15.91]I'm gonna go to the left.
[71:17.85]I'm gonna go underneath.
[71:19.75]I'm gonna go up through and drill under.
[71:23.60]Alright, that didn't do anything.
[71:27.22]It was just there for fun, so let's just go.
[71:32.30]This is not a secret.
[71:37.10]Unless, no.
[71:37.56]You know, sometimes I have complaints about controls.
[71:51.13]Like, I don't know, I gotta tell you, when I press B and I don't move and I press... It's very tight.
[71:56.97]I've not had one real complaint about the controls of the game.
[72:08.15]But I am gonna continue to accidentally Meat Boy.
[72:10.39]It's gonna happen for the rest of the entire stream.
[72:13.60]Secret?
[72:14.32]Oh yeah.
[72:19.04]Where's the joystick?
[72:24.18]Hmm.
[72:28.44]Got ya.
[72:29.96]Not allowed to dash, but you sure can if you grab it.
[72:37.75]Are we ever going to find out what's in the cube?
[72:41.03]Oh, you want to know what's in the cube?
[72:43.62]Oh, okay.
[72:44.96]Alright.
[72:45.30]So what I'm thinking is I think Epic is... No, we're not going down that road.
[72:55.41]So now do I actually make a phone call?
[73:09.76]This is mom.
[73:11.48]Hi, mom.
[73:13.64]John, what a nice surprise.
[73:15.06]How was your trip?
[73:16.74]It's okay.
[73:17.58]I'm just kind of overwhelmed.
[73:20.08]Oh, no.
[73:20.46]Are you having another panic attack?
[73:22.06]Focus on your breathing, honey.
[73:23.12]I'm here.
[73:24.54]What's going on?
[73:33.72]That's it.
[73:35.14]I picked up the phone.
[73:39.04]But what if inside the cube is another cube?
[73:40.60]Well, then Peter Molyneux is going to have a lot of explaining to do.
[73:43.12]6 out of 18.
[73:50.01]I did... Oh, wait, hold on.
[73:56.43]I want to go look at that.
[73:59.87]What is this?
[74:00.39]B-side.
[74:02.60]Old site.
[74:03.48]Black moonrise mix.
[74:04.36]Music.
[74:04.70]Music.
[74:09.98]So it's you... So it's just a different... Oh boy, hold on.
[74:14.08]This is different.
[74:18.33]Ow.
[74:24.53]This is just a secondary fun mode.
[74:31.64]Figured it out in 10 seconds, that's all I needed.
[74:40.39]That's all I needed.
[74:40.97]I'll get it.
[74:44.57]I'll get it.
[74:45.01]I just might control it.
[74:46.36]Control.
[74:46.72]Something about the control.
[74:53.56]Jump.
[74:53.88]Um.
[74:55.80]Yeah.
[74:56.26]Uh.
[74:57.00]What do you mean, jump?
[75:02.95]Why is everyone going to jump?
[75:06.21]Jump.
[75:06.63]That's what I'm doing, isn't it?
[75:10.24]Just jump.
[75:11.06]Hmm.
[75:11.42]Oh shit, well... Okay.
[75:19.60]Come on, do it!
[75:38.32]Oh shit, I gotta go faster than that.
[75:44.06]Ooh, alright, alright, alright, alright, okay.
[75:52.78]Oof.
[75:53.16]It's gonna take another little bit, too.
[76:07.47]Had it.
[76:08.33]Had it.
[76:10.07]Gonna go straight up for this one.
[76:21.18]Uh-oh.
[76:23.22]Uh-oh.
[76:24.28]Uh-oh!
[76:27.06]Ah, that's it.
[76:29.62]How much of it off?
[76:38.41]No, no, you blew it again.
[76:40.00]I can't, I gotta, just regular jump.
[76:48.53]Fuck, I'm gonna do a straight up.
[77:02.10]There's the question, though, is how in the heck you gotta just grab.
[77:05.34]I get it.
[77:08.64]You gotta grab and don't dash.
[77:10.40]You need to jump around.
[77:11.28]How the fuck am I gonna do that?
[77:19.60]You gotta go like this.
[77:21.68]I'm so annoyed at that.
[77:24.62]Not the game, myself.
[77:30.35]I mean, I'm pressing A. Pretty clear.
[77:33.09]Shut up and play.
[77:34.55]Okay, who am I talking to?
[77:38.37]Alright, I'm losing it here.
[77:44.59]I'm hitting the ceiling.
[77:54.16]Am I not doing it fast enough in there?
[78:02.69]I'm so dumb, I can get it, it's fine.
[78:04.69]Come on, recharge, recharge!
[78:06.07]Whoa, whoa, wait, okay, hold on!
[78:11.17]Oh, fuck!
[78:12.53]Good.
[78:13.76]What do we got?
[78:14.54]Oh no, not one of these!
[78:15.84]Not one of these, I don't wanna do this!
[78:19.52]So we gotta go through, up.
[78:22.70]Oh man, I gotta block this out.
[78:25.14]Maybe jump up here first?
[78:30.03]And then, hold on.
[78:35.13]I don't know.
[78:35.67]Maybe... CookieCRM with 10 community subs.
[78:38.97]Thank you, Cookie.
[78:44.24]How do I get up there?
[78:45.36]That's the real question, actually.
[78:50.44]Let me see.
[78:55.16]Yeah.
[78:56.23]Oh, come on.
[78:56.81]Really?
[78:57.03]I do have to get that one first.
[79:07.58]It's the, yeah.
[79:08.74]Do I have the extension turned on or is this part of the game?
[79:17.77]Shit.
[79:18.99]I gotta go at an angle down that way.
[79:20.64]I actually should probably get this one first.
[79:25.32]And then go middle.
[79:27.24]No, go from left to right.
[79:30.94]This one... Straight up, then into the corner.
[79:38.29]Into the corner.
[79:40.19]Get back!
[79:40.59]Come on!
[79:40.93]Come on!
[79:41.25]Let's go!
[79:44.35]Now what?
[79:44.89]Oh, fuck.
[79:47.47]Straight up?
[79:47.89]Looks like it.
[79:51.83]Whoa.
[79:54.06]Straight up.
[79:54.80]Nice.
[79:58.23]gonna be tough you gotta hit that while you're going in I don't know where to go from there though what hold on how does this end
[80:23.25]And then back up.
[80:24.63]I am so confused.
[80:25.27]Hold on.
[80:25.65]Through the whole thing?
[80:26.53]Okay.
[80:27.79]Alright.
[80:28.25]Alright!
[80:36.01]Oh!
[80:36.55]I angled it wrong.
[80:37.95]I didn't mean to angle it.
[80:38.99]Sometimes it just angles.
[80:50.28]Got it.
[80:55.81]God damn.
[81:01.01]That's it.
[81:06.61]There's a lot to this.
[81:07.51]Alright, at least the clone is gone.
[81:12.95]Left?
[81:15.13]Left jump up?
[81:22.70]You idiot.
[81:23.66]I had it.
[81:31.20]Again, I didn't mean to do that.
[81:36.17]I didn't mean to do that either.
[81:37.25]Fucking Meat Boy.
[81:38.89]I should have never played Meat Boy.
[81:59.15]There's even more!
[82:03.05]Uh, up?
[82:04.89]Up and then... Um... Up?
[82:11.73]And then down to the bottom right?
[82:14.68]And then walk?
[82:15.52]I don't know.
[82:16.32]We're gonna have to just do it.
[82:18.02]And then cross.
[82:23.26]Oh, down, maybe?
[82:33.40]Oh, fuck me!
[82:34.84]Whoa, okay, hold on.
[82:36.84]So, I get, oh.
[82:40.40]I gotta get that one last.
[82:43.00]Alright, it's gonna take me a second.
[82:49.48]Fuck, no.
[82:53.83]Go up, what are you doing?
[82:57.75]I really think you have to get this one last, but for some reason I'm a moron and I'm getting it.
[83:06.68]Shit.
[83:06.96]I'm doing this in the wrong order.
[83:10.96]Like, that much is absolutely hurtful.
[83:29.25]I fucked it up again.
[83:31.67]Why?
[83:32.99]I have to go from the top left to the bottom right.
[83:36.86]So get the top left one last.
[83:39.60]I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter, does it?
[84:02.29]Shit!
[84:02.63]That's not the right one!
[84:03.37]I gotta get up there.
[84:08.60]Fuck.
[84:22.91]trying to bait them no sometimes the controller really does make me go the direction I don't want to go what are you doing shit that was it I had it I just didn't do it fucking far enough
[85:13.72]Oh my god!
[85:16.14]Give me a break!
[85:17.46]Why?
[85:18.82]I had it again!
[85:19.98]At least I have a pattern down that I can reliably do.
[85:28.48]Got it.
[85:28.78]Okay.
[85:29.10]There's more.
[85:39.86]Oh no!
[85:53.64]Fuck you.
[86:05.59]So, somebody just said, if this is end game content, what am I doing this for?
[86:16.65]I just have to hold it!
[86:25.46]Is this like bonus end game kind of shit?
[86:31.35]Fuck.
[86:31.63]So what you're saying is I'm gonna get like this stuff out of the way.
[86:52.35]Come on, you can do it!
[86:53.35]And, effectively, I'm doing some of the harder missions.
[86:58.88]Okay, that's cool.
[87:00.68]It's really fun.
[87:07.16]Down?
[87:12.07]Now what?
[87:13.45]How do I go... I guess I didn't like that, but...
[87:21.10]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[87:24.24]I had it.
[87:24.72]What am I doing?
[87:26.50]I forgot about the spikes.
[87:27.66]I don't know why I'm trying to go left there.
[87:55.40]No, there's more!
[87:57.36]How much more is there?
[88:03.66]Interesting.
[88:10.49]What's going on here?
[88:17.43]Down diagonal?
[88:26.92]I'm trying to diagonal.
[88:46.61]Hold on, I got caught there, hold on.
[88:54.62]I'm literally pressing up.
[88:58.02]Alright, okay.
[89:00.14]So I can dash right at the last second before I hit these spikes.
[89:14.58]Holy shit, okay.
[89:19.55]I gotta grab the wall.
[89:30.24]Shit, oh man.
[89:31.70]Alright, so it's hold the wall, go, dash, upright, bottom right, up, left, and then grab the wall.
[89:47.98]Damn.
[89:59.83]Shit.
[90:00.15]I don't have any more.
[90:02.82]Oh no.
[90:03.46]So I gotta jump out of this one, right?
[90:06.60]Come on, really?
[90:20.66]What was that?
[90:21.08]You saw me dash?
[90:21.96]I dashed up into it.
[90:30.86]Meat boy, quit fucking me.
[90:36.50]That came out.
[90:37.74]Meat boy.
[90:41.85]No!
[90:49.44]I wonder... Straight up?
[90:58.14]Yep, straight up, and then what?
[91:00.64]That's the real question.
[91:06.46]Holy shit!
[91:08.14]I didn't even get to see that part, so hold on.
[91:10.72]Up, up, up.
[91:14.12]Top left?
[91:15.35]Or top right?
[91:21.06]You should just play the main game.
[91:25.34]Yeah, I kind of just accidentally clicked on this, didn't I?
[91:33.97]He's gonna finish this and he's going to breeze through the campaign.
[91:37.29]Maybe I shouldn't be, like, muscle memory learning how to do all this.
[91:49.92]There are no checkpoints on B-side.
[91:54.01]Really?
[91:54.35]Jesus.
[91:56.33]Wait a minute.
[92:03.91]Oh my goodness.
[92:06.35]At least I can see that now.
[92:08.95]I already passed the checkpoint?
[92:10.71]I did?
[92:21.34]No!
[92:21.52]I'm trying to rush it.
[92:23.44]I'm trying to rush it.
[92:25.56]I'm not even trying to rush it!
[92:27.06]What happened there?
[92:32.02]If you quit a chapter, you lose all... How close am I to finishing this?
[92:38.59]How many more are after this?
[92:39.73]What?
[92:40.99]How is that not working?
[92:46.14]Oh my god.
[92:47.88]I probably should start using the d-pad.
[92:49.16]That's gonna happen over and over again.
[92:51.32]Now I'm using the d-pad, it's still working.
[92:53.04]It's still happening.
[92:53.64]Shit.
[92:54.14]Up?
[92:54.44]Through both?
[92:55.78]Very close.
[92:56.26]No!
[93:20.39]I mean, I would agree with you, but I am using an Xbox One controller.
[93:24.63]Which, as you know, the D-pad is one giant button.
[93:26.99]It's the worst D-pad of any controller.
[93:28.89]If you press up on an Xbox One controller, you're pressing, like, all of the top of the whole controller.
[93:45.04]You might as well be pressing every face button, too.
[93:47.20]Alright.
[93:47.64]Come on, I can do this.
[93:58.04]Arrow keys?
[94:00.74]Yeah, but you could- ugh, so irritating.
[94:03.56]Uh, arrow keys?
[94:05.00]Sure.
[94:05.22]But then you actually- you have to play with keyboard.
[94:08.04]Which is- uh, I can't.
[94:09.29]It's unbearable for me.
[94:14.43]Dammit.
[94:16.79]Alright.
[94:17.61]What the hell do I do when I get there?
[94:19.45]Do I have to go... ...grab on to the- okay.
[94:24.84]Through top left, grab the ledge, and then through top right?
[94:28.72]Let's try it.
[94:33.59]If I can get there.
[94:41.03]I... Oh, I gotta go through there.
[94:43.27]Oh, I had it.
[94:44.55]Oh, that sucks.
[94:46.89]No.
[94:53.80]That's it.
[94:54.24]That's it.
[94:54.56]That's it.
[94:54.86]That's it.
[94:55.16]That's it.
[94:55.54]That's it.
[94:59.30]I'm not gonna fall through that damn thing.
[95:02.46]What the hell am I gonna do about that?
[95:09.32]I tried to jump out of it, just didn't do it.
[95:20.78]Why is it not jumping out?
[95:23.22]Is there a reason why that's not happening?
[95:24.36]I keep trying to jump out of there.
[95:47.41]Holy shit.
[95:48.45]Alright, come on.
[95:49.15]That's it, right?
[95:50.57]This is it.
[95:50.95]This has to be it.
[95:52.27]I'm on level one.
[95:53.67]I'm on level two of the actual campaign.
[95:59.36]Alright, what do I need to do?
[96:00.28]Why did I open this?
[96:13.55]I guess we're gonna go straight up.
[96:16.09]Get that one.
[96:17.79]To the left?
[96:20.68]I gotta just do it.
[96:21.70]I can't just peek.
[96:32.96]Holy shit, what the hell did I just do to myself?
[96:36.58]I didn't jump.
[96:37.62]Oh no.
[96:38.56]Um, but hold on.
[96:55.83]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[96:57.09]So then we're gonna jump over, fall, through, hold on, hold on now.
[97:02.69]Through, hold it, hold on now.
[97:05.09]What do I do now?
[97:06.59]What happened?
[97:07.25]No, I had to, what does it, where does it go?
[97:09.90]What the fuck was that?
[97:12.86]It makes a wall, so I gotta, ah, I gotta go from there and diagonal up to the right.
[97:17.56]Shit.
[97:18.76]Alright, I had it.
[97:32.17]Got it.
[97:32.59]No!
[97:32.99]Let's just make sure I get this correct!
[97:41.13]Let's do it.
[97:41.63]Let's finish this damn thing.
[97:42.57]Oh my god, that's high.
[97:52.54]So I'm gonna start on the right screen.
[97:55.81]Left.
[97:56.09]I think we just have to go back and forth.
[97:59.52]Grab that one, you get a dash again.
[98:00.98]And then... I gotta get that jump down.
[98:17.77]Can you just queue it up inside?
[98:20.05]No, it has to be right on the lip, doesn't it?
[98:28.51]Damn.
[98:30.31]Alright.
[98:31.93]I guess I'm gonna do it that way.
[98:34.09]Maybe not.
[98:34.45]Can I just go?
[98:35.19]Can I just go up?
[98:36.07]Just try going like this.
[98:39.58]No.
[98:40.38]I mean, maybe.
[98:41.16]That's gonna be tough.
[98:51.50]No.
[98:51.97]No way.
[98:52.73]Maybe.
[98:53.01]Maybe.
[98:53.53]Hold on.
[98:54.03]If I just jump up the normal way.
[98:59.90]Okay, no, I can do that.
[99:06.35]I have to jump out of that, which is the biggest pain in the ass for me, is trying to get the jump.
[99:14.93]Got it, okay.
[99:25.64]Now, where does that go?
[99:27.44]Oh, come on.
[99:29.24]Where does it go?
[99:29.96]Give me this stupid fucking skull thing.
[99:31.60]Where does it drop?
[99:33.71]It drops down there.
[99:35.61]And then... I have to go back.
[99:41.15]What's the point of this?
[99:41.83]I don't know.
[99:42.35]What's the point of this?
[99:43.11]Why don't I just leave?
[99:44.63]Can I just leave?
[99:52.60]What does that do for me?
[100:02.24]It's so unreliable for me.
[100:13.48]That makes spikes all the way down.
[100:15.74]Oh, come on.
[100:18.36]I don't get what's the point of putting it down.
[100:36.08]Oh, Jesus.
[100:44.89]I guess maybe I'll just grab onto it?
[100:48.55]Why is the jump so unreliable?!
[100:53.70]I'm doing it at the same time, every time.
[100:55.54]Oh my god.
[101:12.71]What the fuck am I doing?
[101:14.96]What the fuck?
[101:20.80]I'm so confused
[101:35.76]So straight through and then up up Yeah, and then I gotta go back down and around the whole damn thing I guess Maybe not
[102:12.35]Curious of how the hell this plays out.
[102:17.71]Let me look at it again, because it seems like that's not the right thing to do.
[102:27.18]So I grab onto the... It comes down.
[102:28.94]I grab onto it.
[102:30.76]I have to go to the top left.
[102:37.02]Or maybe I could just go back.
[102:38.26]Why would I go back to the... Yeah.
[102:39.58]So I gotta go top left.
[102:46.30]Okay, alright, alright, straight right.
[102:47.88]I feel ya.
[102:52.91]Now I'm just rushing because my brain is scrambled eggs.
[102:55.97]Alright, here we go.
[103:10.95]Oh, fuck.
[103:12.13]Um.
[103:13.17]Um.
[103:20.70]Oh!
[103:21.64]I dug!
[103:22.32]No!
[103:22.80]Fuck!
[103:23.52]Oh!
[103:24.10]Aye!
[103:25.02]Ow!
[103:27.61]That was it.
[103:28.03]I got it.
[103:33.98]I'm so- I had- I didn't- I thought I hit the wall, that's why I freaked out, because I didn't- I didn't have control.
[103:40.81]I like let- I took my- I'm rushing again.
[103:50.33]I got it, it's over, I beat it.
[103:54.19]I mean, it's a fucking pain in the ass, but I did- Alright, would you slow down?
[104:00.14]You did it, you know what to do, just finish it.
[104:20.78]Bingo.
[104:22.89]Anything else?
[104:53.13]Just get, just pick it up.
[104:54.77]Come on.
[104:56.43]Black Moon Rise.
[105:22.70]What does that mean?
[105:35.15]What do I get for doing that?
[105:44.06]B-side complete.
[105:44.92]So what does that do?
[105:47.50]Times... I get 199.
[105:47.94]I hate that.
[105:48.46]I wish I died one more time.
[105:57.38]Go back and die.
[106:00.58]Okay.
[106:00.86]Well, that was cool.
[106:03.82]I like that, because that was... Okay, so that was challenging.
[106:07.12]But it wasn't impossible.
[106:09.38]It was just challenging and fun.
[106:12.09]Cool.
[106:17.09]He's so early in the game.
[106:18.47]I know.
[106:18.97]I don't know why I did it.
[106:20.89]It was fun.
[106:23.35]Celestial Resort.
[106:24.81]Chapter 3.
[106:27.89]It wasn't dogshit impossible.
[106:30.79]Yeah.
[106:34.31]Sometimes games like this just make it dogshit impossible for you.
[106:43.72]Be proud of your death count.
[106:45.04]The more you die, the more you're learning.
[106:46.46]Keep going.
[106:49.54]Yeah, that's true.
[106:55.41]Hey, welcome back to the regular game.
[106:57.91]It all feels so easy now.
[107:02.11]Look, I just have to walk.
[107:05.25]That's great.
[107:07.45]Look at how easy it is to avoid.
[107:08.67]I'm bold.
[107:12.09]Wait, can I get on the roof?
[107:17.23]No.
[107:20.09]You're gonna die more times here than the last level.
[107:22.79]Just saying.
[107:24.59]Really?
[107:29.43]Well, I got a berry.
[107:30.45]Maybe not, not yet.
[107:35.96]Hmm.
[107:38.54]Don't I die?
[107:39.42]It's okay, just start here.
[107:41.68]I'm gonna, yeah, probably gonna go up here.
[107:45.76]Why not?
[107:46.88]I guess I do have to get up there somehow.
[107:48.48]Hmm.
[107:55.13]Hmm.
[108:02.73]Oh, fuck!
[108:09.35]Hold on.
[108:09.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[108:11.01]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[108:16.37]Oh, look at that!
[108:20.84]I cheated.
[108:21.32]I'm still cheating, by the way.
[108:27.82]The dash just resets upon exiting, and yeah, that's cool.
[108:31.44]Speaking of berries...
[108:39.20]Anymore?
[108:39.54]17.
[108:46.74]Ooh.
[108:47.78]A key.
[108:48.34]Oh.
[108:49.66]It's not that exciting.
[108:50.66]It opens this door.
[108:53.77]I was gonna say... Cool secret!
[108:56.13]Oops.
[109:00.77]What else is up here?
[109:07.29]Berry.
[109:13.02]Well, I probably have to go inside and then left for this one.
[109:17.80]I got the secret fucking key, that's right.
[109:19.58]And I said the F word, I'm sorry.
[109:26.06]This is kind of like the last level in DuckTales, the last boss room when you fight Dracula.
[109:30.82]Oddly specific, I know, I'm sorry.
[109:32.86]That's just the way it is.
[109:36.66]Please ring for service.
[109:49.79]I'm wasting the battery on my automaton.
[109:52.13]Welcome, may I help you?
[109:52.89]Are you a ghost?
[109:56.81]Ghosts don't be silly.
[109:58.61]I am the concierge of this fine establishment.
[110:02.71]Welcome to the world-renowned Celestial Resort Hotel.
[110:10.76]Mr. Oshiro at your service.
[110:15.62]Two guests in one day.
[110:16.66]Business is finally picking up.
[110:18.96]How long will you be staying with us?
[110:21.58]Oh, I'm just passing through.
[110:22.74]I'm climbing the mountain.
[110:23.80]Do you have a back exit?
[110:29.44]A back exit.
[110:31.33]Just passing through.
[110:32.17]This will not do.
[110:32.99]You know I can still hear you.
[110:36.35]Right.
[110:40.43]In any case, our rear service door is reserved for hotel staff only.
[110:43.39]However, our top floor presidential suite features a Y-class view of the peak.
[110:48.16]Yes, you'll be quite comfortable up there.
[110:52.90]Why am I hearing phone signal sounds?
[110:57.78]I don't know.
[110:58.16]That's... I'm not hearing...
[111:03.33]Maybe I could get on the roof from there and climb down the back.
[111:06.85]Presidential suite.
[111:07.73]Marvelous idea, Oshiro.
[111:09.63]What is your name for our records?
[111:12.41]I'm John.
[111:13.33]But again, I'm really not interested in staying.
[111:17.26]Right this way.
[111:17.86]Ms.
[111:18.38]John.
[111:23.36]What do I do?
[111:23.88]What do I do?
[111:24.24]What do I do?
[111:25.48]I can ring it again.
[111:26.80]What's this?
[111:28.40]Very old, dusty guest book.
[111:29.86]Many of the pages are damaged or missing.
[111:33.62]The comments, however, are glowing.
[111:36.26]We'll never forget our time here.
[111:38.22]I've never felt more at peace.
[111:39.46]Thank you.
[111:39.86]Okay.
[111:41.76]Does he come back?
[111:45.42]Nope.
[111:46.56]Alright.
[111:50.87]Making it easy for me.
[111:51.79]Yeah.
[111:55.39]Yep.
[112:01.57]This ball... I don't think it does.
[112:08.42]So, berry.
[112:09.03]I can jump down, grab berry, dash left.
[112:26.74]That would hurt.
[112:27.78]I need to like take a break.
[112:29.12]That hurt.
[112:30.83]It really did.
[112:31.39]Some weight is involved in this one.
[112:34.15]Is it?
[112:35.07]Okay.
[112:35.67]Just was curious how it worked.
[112:36.79]I can put extra weight on it.
[112:38.45]Make it go faster.
[112:40.03]Didn't even need the other dash.
[112:45.01]Did I get too good at the game to not need that dash?
[112:50.29]Is there such a thing?
[112:51.89]Secret.
[112:52.43]Oh.
[112:56.26]Wait, what's down here?
[113:00.91]This is going to go all the way to the left, right, and out the door.
[113:04.15]Did I just skip everything?
[113:05.90]No.
[113:09.54]Don't get a big head about this.
[113:11.44]So that's just the way back.
[113:14.37]Okay.
[113:36.80]More community subs.
[113:39.20]Why did I end up here?
[113:39.86]Did I just... Hold on.
[113:43.84]Great Canadian fuck club, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[113:47.33]There's been a shitload tonight.
[113:48.27]There's been like 50 or 60 community subs tonight, hasn't there?
[113:59.21]Thanks a lot guys, seriously.
[114:07.35]Did I miss a secret?
[114:14.34]So much mold.
[114:15.72]Ooh!
[114:18.32]Okay, well, let's check a look over here.
[114:25.21]Another tape.
[114:25.85]I ain't doing that one.
[114:28.47]I'll do that one like next week.
[114:40.16]Do it now I can't I can't even go that way I'm gonna pee my pants.
[114:46.36]Alright, just alright.
[114:47.50]Let me pee my pants and then we'll get going It's always two after two hours, it's two hours on the mark every time Right before I leave dead Oh dead Oh, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[115:00.57]Oh
[115:02.81]Thank you for your like 75 community subs in the first hour and a half of the stream.
[115:07.01]Two hours.
[115:12.54]You guys are too generous.
[115:14.40]I'll be right back.
[115:14.92]I'm just gonna pee.
[117:57.06]Hi there.
[118:00.00]How you doing?
[118:09.12]Let's grab some water, too.
[118:12.82]Because you need to hydrate when you're playing video games.
[118:18.04]How's the audio, too?
[118:18.80]Am I too soft?
[118:19.74]Too loud?
[118:20.20]I feel like I might need to drop the audio a little bit in the game.
[118:28.02]Maybe like... Maybe like by 2%.
[118:39.59]How's that?
[118:40.07]Better?
[118:41.05]That's probably a little better.
[118:46.72]Yeah, I'm never loud enough for some crazy reason.
[118:49.20]I don't know why.
[118:49.76]Alright, we're good.
[119:01.46]Oh, okay.
[119:02.10]There's a little spot to fall down there.
[119:11.58]Cool.
[119:13.32]Ah, it's gonna take me all the way to the left.
[119:14.88]It's gonna be the thing that I need to get.
[119:17.50]Guaranteed.
[119:19.32]Oh, I didn't see that meatball there.
[119:25.30]There it is.
[119:29.42]BRB, my McAfee antivirus needs to update.
[119:35.68]Why do you have McAfee?
[119:45.47]Is that like an all the way to the left Best Buy computer?
[119:48.70]Because they all have McAfee on them.
[120:00.43]Oh, he's getting political.
[120:03.21]So that takes us to the key, then we gotta go down.
[120:05.55]Oh, I stepped on it.
[120:17.22]Cool.
[120:19.02]Got the two berries in there.
[120:20.56]Oops.
[120:26.96]I tried to rush it, and that's what happened.
[120:32.90]The music is changing.
[120:33.80]Oh, what about... Can I hold these?
[120:36.00]Oh, no.
[120:36.58]Okay.
[120:36.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[120:37.46]I see.
[120:38.94]Do they ever go back down?
[120:39.86]I don't think they do.
[120:46.30]But it's okay.
[120:46.86]I don't even need them.
[120:53.66]Or I might.
[120:54.24]I actually might need them.
[120:56.92]Oh, fuck.
[120:57.38]What am I doing?
[121:07.69]Same deal.
[121:08.23]Gotta go across.
[121:11.07]Aye.
[121:12.49]Aye.
[121:13.23]Alright.
[121:15.42]Ah, wait, I can go up there.
[121:16.18]I want to go up there.
[121:17.42]I think I want to go up there.
[121:19.66]Oops.
[121:32.55]So I need the dash, so how am I going to do that to not dash?
[121:46.78]little too long.
[121:47.56]Oof!
[121:49.41]Ah!
[121:50.81]Fuck.
[121:51.79]That was it too.
[121:52.65]Shit!
[121:55.59]Just grab on the edge and just climb and jump.
[122:03.89]Got it.
[122:04.13]Alright, what's up here?
[122:07.56]Berry!
[122:09.18]Gosh, I didn't even see the thing at the top.
[122:13.86]Didn't even look.
[122:20.27]Well, I have to have a dash, so you have to follow the dash.
[122:24.27]Got it.
[122:34.32]No shit!
[122:35.20]You gotta grab the edge, Jeremy!
[122:37.88]Jeremy?
[122:48.13]Any more dialogue for me?
[122:50.79]Please follow me closely, Miss John.
[122:52.87]The elevator is just down the hall.
[122:55.25]The hotel's in pretty rough shape.
[122:59.57]Is it really open for business?
[123:00.89]Of course we're open.
[123:02.35]The Celestial Resort Hotel would never close during prime tourism season.
[123:05.77]What does she mean by that?
[123:13.87]This water is a little...
[123:18.08]I think it might be time for a filter change on that water.
[123:21.66]My bag?
[123:22.10]No thanks, I'll keep it.
[123:25.61]Very well.
[123:27.49]What a peculiar guest.
[123:32.22]Don't do that, I'm sorry.
[123:35.56]I forgot, that was a mouth noise.
[123:54.17]What are you thinking?
[123:59.92]I'm thinking this.
[124:03.08]I didn't get that?
[124:04.62]Somehow?
[124:06.71]Do I even need to jump?
[124:11.83]Probably, yeah.
[124:13.01]I gotta wait.
[124:15.33]Oh my god.
[124:23.99]What's wrong with me?
[124:26.51]This is the one where you have to wait.
[124:28.01]I don't like waiting.
[124:41.30]Just wait.
[124:44.32]The diamond.
[124:46.54]There has to be some reason why I did not see that.
[124:49.54]I don't know why, it was just right in front of me the whole time.
[124:55.72]I don't know, I didn't even see it.
[125:08.95]Locked door.
[125:10.38]I don't even need the diamonds.
[125:26.10]Chevy.
[125:26.36]I got an idea.
[125:29.90]Shit.
[125:32.17]Hmm.
[125:32.91]Hmm.
[125:33.49]Hmm.
[125:55.70]So I obviously have to push that all the way to the bottom and then dash back onto it.
[126:02.18]If I were a gamer, that's what I would be doing right now, but I'm not doing it right now.
[126:07.06]I'm just... Shouldn't have played the B-sides.
[126:14.36]Shouldn't have played the B-sides.
[126:20.06]I'm gonna have to go slow, and I was so used to just like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[126:28.50]That might be enough.
[126:29.04]You stupid idiot.
[126:31.22]What's wrong with you?
[126:39.52]Got it.
[126:40.24]Get it!
[126:40.52]Collect it!
[126:41.40]Collect it!
[126:42.16]Thank you.
[126:52.53]Wow, guys.
[126:52.93]Look at this gamer.
[126:57.55]I've played a game before.
[126:58.37]One.
[127:00.95]Well, that was really stupid because that's exactly what I had to do.
[127:03.25]But I used my dash.
[127:08.13]I did it again.
[127:20.94]Fuck.
[127:22.08]You gotta grab onto the side and jump.
[127:24.12]I'm so dumb.
[127:32.17]Oh, shit.
[127:35.00]Shit.
[127:36.13]Well, now I get it.
[127:38.65]You gotta skip that one.
[128:04.94]What about it?
[128:05.36]I'm gonna go up there?
[128:18.93]Boomer vision.
[128:19.63]I don't have boomer vision.
[128:21.55]I just... So this is where you get the super secret one.
[128:24.33]Alright, hold on.
[128:31.53]It's one of your powers.
[128:38.41]There is... Alright.
[128:39.89]There actually is a lot... There are a lot of ways to go.
[128:44.67]Fuck, you gotta go diagonal.
[128:52.36]Maybe fall this way and then... Okay.
[129:01.44]Ooooooh!
[129:02.50]Okay.
[129:02.68]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[129:04.88]Just fall in and dash.
[129:06.42]Up.
[129:09.05]It's that easy.
[129:10.29]Collect it.
[129:12.84]I don't want to do this again.
[129:14.60]Collect it!
[129:15.02]Are you gonna make me do this whole thing?
[129:21.74]To prove that I... I'm not capable.
[129:27.99]My fucking dirty hair just got in the way.
[129:58.91]So, I did it.
[130:00.67]We'll just go.
[130:09.02]Hmm.
[130:12.84]Secret down here?
[130:14.46]Yes, there is.
[130:14.98]Okay.
[130:25.85]Wait.
[130:27.47]I gotta get that key.
[130:30.49]When you get up there, why is this harder than me doing the thing?
[130:37.71]Not even hard.
[130:38.97]I mean, it was a little hard.
[130:40.76]I mean, that's where the meat boy powers come in, though.
[130:50.61]Uh, okay, for a second I thought I could stand on the piano, and then my brain immediately corrected itself.
[130:59.48]I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[131:00.62]I gotta slow down.
[131:13.41]There's no reason to go that fast.
[131:23.54]See, just slow down.
[131:24.40]There's no reason to go that crazy.
[131:33.68]Key!
[131:34.02]Got it!
[131:34.22]I could go left though.
[131:43.10]No, this is the key to the door, right?
[131:51.86]Oops.
[131:53.87]It's alright, I can get it again.
[131:54.81]No!
[131:55.95]Fall?
[131:57.13]No.
[131:57.81]Alright, I saw the meatball on the left.
[132:04.74]I gotta go from the other side.
[132:05.64]Up top?
[132:17.23]Wait, but what about down there?
[132:18.05]That looks really... It looks like I'm supposed to go through that.
[132:22.47]Doesn't it?
[132:22.77]I don't know, there's a lot of secrets in this game.
[132:30.80]Miss John, I really must implore you to keep up.
[132:32.72]I'm running a world-class establishment here.
[132:34.72]I don't have time to wait around for meandering guests.
[132:40.07]You really don't have to wait for me.
[132:42.25]I'm just looking for a way through this place.
[132:46.81]Oshiro, you idiot.
[132:47.53]The customer's always right.
[132:49.31]Business is finally picking up and you lose your temper.
[132:53.65]Of course, Miss John.
[132:55.04]My sincere apologies.
[132:56.86]I was out of line.
[132:58.42]Please feel free to explore at your leisure.
[133:02.20]And I will.
[133:06.12]Right through?
[133:06.54]I don't think so.
[133:14.69]I don't like the Tetris room.
[133:17.81]This is just failed Tetris.
[133:19.38]This is what it looks like when I play.
[133:22.12]I don't like it.
[133:35.11]I need a key.
[133:38.95]Where do I go?
[133:40.49]I'm gonna go down?
[133:41.47]Down?
[133:43.33]Down again?
[133:44.19]Down more?
[133:44.73]Can't break it.
[133:57.04]This must turn into something.
[133:58.28]This must... This is probably a dream level up here, I would assume.
[134:03.99]Goddamn maze.
[134:04.47]Yeah, this is gonna open up.
[134:16.21]Hello, sir.
[134:18.91]This clutter is out of control.
[134:21.88]When did this happen?
[134:22.78]I don't even know where to begin.
[134:29.22]Do you run this place by yourself?
[134:31.42]You're right, Ms.
[134:32.00]John.
[134:32.44]I'll never sort this mess out alone.
[134:35.34]It's hopeless.
[134:37.10]It's not what I meant.
[134:38.64]Just breathe, Mr. Oshiro.
[134:39.86]Breathe.
[134:40.96]It's just a little spring cleaning.
[134:42.60]Well, more than a little.
[134:43.72]But I can... Oh, no.
[134:48.11]It's a lost cause.
[134:49.15]I gotta fix this.
[134:50.35]I gotta fix the Tetris room.
[135:00.21]How long have you been running the hotel?
[135:01.36]Quite some time now.
[135:04.24]Business has been slow.
[135:06.46]You must really love your work.
[135:15.22]Oh yes.
[135:17.61]In the hotel business, our passion is perfecting the delicate art of hospitality.
[135:21.36]A truly great hotel lives eternally in the cherished memories of its satisfied guests.
[135:27.22]That's the spirit.
[135:28.66]Now let's get started on this mess.
[135:35.03]Alright, where do I go?
[135:38.93]I'm going this way, so we're going to go this way.
[135:41.39]Oh, Thane!
[135:42.41]What's up, man?
[135:44.07]YOLO!
[135:44.61]Remember YOLO?
[135:45.41]Uh-huh.
[135:47.14]Are you a guest here too?
[135:50.38]John, I'm so happy to see you right now.
[135:56.48]I'm all about spooky mysteries, but this is getting too real.
[136:00.79]Have you talked to Mr. Oshiro?
[136:01.99]I think he could really use some help.
[136:04.61]You think?
[136:05.83]He's a creepy old weirdo.
[136:07.27]I bet he's cleaning out a nook to hide our bodies as we speak.
[136:11.89]I'm going to crawl through this vent.
[136:14.41]It's blowing cold air in from outside.
[136:18.98]Come on!
[136:19.82]I was gonna just scream of Captain Falcon.
[136:22.88]But then I thought, I don't think I can do a Captain Falcon.
[136:25.28]So I stalked myself halfway through.
[136:26.66]And that's how it turned out.
[136:30.83]Mr. Oshiro's troubled, but I don't think he wants to hurt us.
[136:33.85]He just needs to clean up this mess.
[136:36.39]I want to help him.
[136:38.43]Gone.
[136:39.15]That's very sweet, but this is dangerous.
[136:44.61]We need to get out of here and call an expert on creepy old dudes.
[136:47.61]We aren't prepared for this.
[136:50.08]I think I can get through to him.
[136:52.44]Well, I mean, you gotta deal with the caramel that's in the dryer right now.
[136:56.18]Somebody's fucking doing something weird in there.
[137:00.00]That's not how you make candy.
[137:01.40]Actually, I guess you could.
[137:02.16]Oh, I'll catch up with you later.
[137:07.69]Man, you're more stubborn than my sister.
[137:10.15]I thought that was impossible.
[137:14.59]Take care of it.
[137:15.07]You can make candy in a dryer.
[137:18.82]in a controlled environment and don't try this at home.
[137:21.81]Thanks Thane, I'll see you outside.
[137:50.74]Oh, I get it.
[137:51.30]I figured out what's going on here.
[137:52.54]All the red, that's all soap.
[137:54.40]That's like all dirty soap and shit from the dryer, the washing machine that collapsed.
[137:58.01]This is like laundry.
[137:59.33]I get it.
[137:59.89]It's like a laundry soap level.
[138:01.73]Okay, I understand now.
[138:04.98]Remember that's there because I won't.
[138:26.19]going the right way?
[138:26.75]I think so.
[138:31.83]How do I get that?
[138:34.93]I can't jump.
[138:35.59]I can't dash.
[138:37.21]How am I supposed to go through that?
[138:45.66]Oh, shit.
[138:46.44]Okay.
[138:46.84]Hold on.
[138:47.08]No.
[138:47.14]Oh, come on.
[138:52.08]I fell off.
[138:52.70]I didn't even press the button.
[138:53.54]I just tripped.
[139:01.09]But I gotta grab onto the edge.
[139:04.57]No, no, no.
[139:04.99]I gotta grab the other edge.
[139:05.71]That's how you do it, but come on, man.
[139:17.36]Stop doing that!
[139:18.08]You're getting me in trouble!
[139:24.41]Why?
[139:24.91]Just jump over!
[139:26.25]What am I doing?
[139:27.19]Meat Boy has ruined my brain!
[139:39.42]Then drop down.
[139:43.71]I'm gonna assume there's probably a few buttons that I have to press.
[139:47.17]And eventually, it's gonna take away all the purple, all the green, all the, right?
[139:51.73]It's gonna be like that.
[139:52.63]I know it is.
[139:57.16]If anybody says I'm wrong, they're banned.
[140:01.10]And I'm talking forever.
[140:02.96]Not like five minutes, ten minutes, no.
[140:05.52]Until twitch.tv turns its servers off.
[140:13.94]There it is.
[140:18.08]Yep.
[140:19.08]I don't know.
[140:23.60]Folded all the laundry, sorted the laundry.
[140:26.83]Everybody thought that... I saw a shitload of question marks.
[140:30.43]And a bunch of, like, a boomer brain and shit like that.
[140:32.81]But that actually was laundry.
[140:34.97]This is water.
[140:36.09]It got folded and put away.
[140:37.73]So... I thought... Really...
[140:53.88]Oh my goodness.
[140:55.60]Wait, what?
[140:59.58]Computer?
[141:05.62]I don't... I mean, this is a secret, but is this a secret just showing me that there's another secret?
[141:51.65]I'm going up here.
[141:53.27]No.
[141:55.58]Somebody said, what are you doing?
[141:56.70]I don't know.
[142:00.20]I'm looking for purple.
[142:05.14]Alright, see?
[142:07.78]Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[142:12.17]Woo!
[142:18.59]Scattered and lost.
[142:25.26]Okay, cool.
[142:25.76]What is it?
[142:26.46]Is that a track?
[142:27.42]Like a music track?
[142:29.48]Holy shit, there's another secret.
[142:33.24]No, that's just an easy way to get back.
[142:34.58]Okay.
[142:39.13]No, wait, wait, wait.
[142:40.61]Oh, boy.
[142:41.91]Okay, well, I lost the opportunity to get the berry that was over there.
[142:44.61]I think.
[142:52.17]A secret level is unlocked after four hearts, so I have two of them, right?
[142:59.30]Can you die in the water?
[143:03.96]No.
[143:04.36]You can always just replay levels.
[143:07.94]Yeah, that's true.
[143:12.63]Ah, right, right, right.
[143:13.49]Here's the other secret it was showing me.
[143:15.63]Computer.
[143:16.05]Computer.
[143:20.22]Alright.
[143:21.14]The Pico 8.
[143:24.74]Celeste.
[143:29.89]Oh no!
[143:30.65]It's a Commander Video Machine from Meat Boy!
[143:37.05]It's- It's a Meat Boy Commander Video Machine.
[143:39.65]Hey, I got a strawberry.
[143:47.66]Does that count?
[143:49.28]Or is this a joke?
[144:01.80]Everything is Meat Boy.
[144:03.22]Can I go to the bottom right?
[144:28.79]Alright.
[144:31.80]Okay, I can't... I gotta... I can't dash.
[144:37.51]Dumb.
[144:45.87]Come here!
[144:46.47]Mmm!
[144:56.50]I can't climb in this one.
[144:57.74]I can't climb up.
[145:10.70]5,000.
[145:10.72]What?
[145:10.94]Got it.
[145:40.21]Oh.
[145:40.37]Nope.
[145:42.09]I'm not gonna do it.
[145:42.77]Now here's the question.
[145:45.39]I guess I go like this.
[145:47.55]I had it.
[145:48.15]You did it.
[145:48.77]But you just didn't do it.
[145:53.31]I had it again.
[145:53.79]But you just didn't do it again.
[145:56.30]Is there a reason why you're doing that?
[146:01.92]There's gotta be a reason why he's doing that, right?
[146:09.47]I don't know.
[146:09.81]Maybe if you look up why he keeps doing that.
[146:22.11]Balloons?
[146:22.51]Okay, that's... Balloons are the dash thing.
[146:33.78]Jump on the frog or the clouds?
[146:35.58]Yep.
[146:48.20]What the hell?
[146:51.96]Just dash and get it!
[146:55.35]Dash and get it!
[146:56.15]Alright, now... How much is left in this little minigame here?
[147:15.89]This is probably it, right?
[147:16.71]A thousand.
[147:20.72]Okay, I gotta hold on to that.
[147:24.78]Hmm.
[147:28.05]This is the rest of the game.
[147:30.53]I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[147:36.17]Land up here.
[147:37.51]Diagonal.
[147:38.69]Bingo.
[147:39.47]I did it.
[147:40.27]No.
[147:43.64]Do I get something for doing this?
[147:45.08]Is this like a thing that I'm gonna get?
[147:53.51]I gotta get the... You don't get anything.
[147:59.13]You don't get anything.
[148:00.35]It's just a side thing.
[148:01.31]It's just fun.
[148:02.89]Oh, okay.
[148:06.98]It's just the original game that they made in a game jam.
[148:11.22]Oh, alright.
[148:13.88]That's cool.
[148:16.06]That's why it's on one of these little computers.
[148:27.23]Hold set.
[148:27.79]Alright, I beat the game.
[148:28.82]This is it.
[148:29.54]I win.
[148:30.68]I beat it.
[148:33.70]Yeah, I win.
[148:36.62]Now playable from the main menu.
[148:38.49]Alright, that's cool.
[148:44.81]Interesting stuff.
[148:47.30]Finish this or you get your gamer license revoked.
[148:49.44]No, that's not the real game.
[148:51.18]I mean, it's the original.
[148:52.37]An old paper sticks out from a clutter.
[148:56.31]Attention hotel staff, it is my sad duty to inform you that the Celestial Resort Hotel will close indefinitely following this season due to circumstances beyond our control.
[149:04.88]It was an honor to have served alongside you all as we worked tirelessly to ensure that our guests enjoy the most hospitable and memorable experience possible.
[149:14.40]I write this with a heavy heart.
[149:15.92]This hotel has become my home.
[149:18.30]It's staff and patrons, my family.
[149:21.02]I miss you all dearly.
[149:22.90]He's a ghost.
[149:26.98]He's a ghost.
[149:27.58]Alright, well that's all we can do here.
[149:38.91]No shit.
[149:40.47]What do you mean no shit?
[149:42.88]He could have been like a ghoul.
[149:45.24]He might have been a ghost.
[149:46.80]He could have... I guess he is very clearly a ghost.
[149:55.74]I gotta get rid of the green.
[150:00.19]He might have just been a guy.
[150:01.59]No, he wasn't a guy.
[150:02.77]Where the hell did I go?
[150:09.09]Is there another way up here?
[150:10.85]No.
[150:11.19]Blocked.
[150:11.63]Blocked.
[150:12.16]Blocked.
[150:12.60]Blocked.
[150:13.20]Blocked.
[150:13.98]Blocked.
[150:14.76]Blocked.
[150:21.80]We have new dialogue.
[150:23.91]Are you okay?
[150:25.03]Yeah
[150:49.49]This is the finest hotel you're ever going to visit.
[150:52.45]How could I let my problems pile up like this?
[150:56.25]And there's how we go.
[150:57.41]One, two, I'll go down.
[150:58.85]Goodbye.
[151:01.91]We're looking for Gween.
[151:05.45]If I can remove the Gween, then we should be fine.
[151:08.71]That's a chest.
[151:09.43]I'll try to get it.
[151:10.29]Wait.
[151:13.91]No.
[151:15.25]Wait, are you sure this is a ghost?
[151:18.49]Maybe he can just float.
[151:27.60]Whoa!
[151:28.66]Whoa!
[151:29.56]Whoa!
[151:30.84]I'm fine.
[151:37.79]Okay.
[151:38.53]I have to squish myself.
[151:40.05]I'm just going to grab a hold of this.
[151:46.68]I was very lucky.
[151:47.72]And I got a whole... Ah!
[151:53.67]Just... You gotta go slow.
[151:55.15]Sometimes the levels are slow.
[152:01.49]What the fuck was that?
[152:02.91]Uh... Oh!
[152:13.36]When you slow me down, that's when I have a problem.
[152:16.22]When you take, when you take me down a notch and I have to go very slowly.
[152:22.30]Look at how much of a problem this causes.
[152:29.82]And I tried to dash off the screen.
[152:31.74]And then I'm gonna go... I don't know, over here.
[152:40.68]I guess.
[152:43.47]Should I have gone down?
[152:44.82]No, it's a secret.
[152:50.68]Well, gotta get back.
[152:51.72]So, um... Fuck.
[152:58.75]I think I have to go all the way around.
[153:19.22]What are you guys doing?
[153:23.47]What?
[153:25.07]Why?
[153:26.19]Why?
[153:27.19]What are you doing?
[153:28.89]What are you doing?
[153:29.69]That doesn't make any sense.
[153:48.74]That doesn't make any sense.
[153:51.04]Who came up with that?
[153:51.90]You guys are throwing me off.
[154:04.65]God damn it.
[154:13.61]I can't jump on those.
[154:16.17]Stop jumping on them.
[154:21.77]You threw me off.
[154:22.99]So hardcore.
[154:33.96]Don't blame us.
[154:35.06]Well, when I look over in my chat and all I see is people talking about how they're fucking farting and shit.
[154:41.00]Like, it's gonna throw me off a little.
[154:43.11]It's gonna fuck me up a little bit.
[154:52.49]Don't touch anything on the ground.
[154:53.59]And then grab this, dash, get over here.
[154:57.61]What the fuck just happened?
[154:58.91]What?
[155:03.47]Oh my god.
[155:04.29]You guys are fucking kidding me.
[155:14.62]Goodness.
[155:16.38]Chat's fault.
[155:17.04]Chat's fault.
[155:17.72]I mean, come on.
[155:18.34]I mean, look.
[155:20.00]It's not Chat's fault.
[155:21.08]It just is.
[155:27.61]I definitely did not do that correctly at all I'll take it though
[156:03.04]Oh my god.
[156:04.04]Are you guys really gonna do this shit?
[156:10.56]Alright, I made it.
[156:34.52]Left.
[156:35.52]Buried.
[156:39.47]Well, I think I have to... I don't know.
[156:49.82]Come on, move!
[156:53.66]I didn't even press X. I didn't, I swear.
[156:55.30]Whatever, let's just see if I can time this right.
[156:59.54]Nope.
[157:07.90]This is like one of the easiest rooms, and for some reason I just can't do it.
[157:13.28]I'm so desperately trying to go as fast as I can, and I got Meat Boy Syndrome.
[157:17.54]Which remember, if you don't know what Meat Boy Syndrome is, it's instead of climbing up, you just launch off the wall.
[157:24.03]So I have this Meat Boy Syndrome that I can't get rid of.
[157:50.17]No.
[157:50.77]Fuck!
[157:51.35]That's it!
[157:52.15]I had it!
[157:52.71]Got him.
[157:53.03]Damn!
[158:23.54]There it is.
[158:24.60]The Cheshire Trest.
[158:34.23]So that gets rid of all those.
[158:40.47]Just the green one to go.
[158:43.09]Wasn't there a blockage over here somewhere?
[158:46.07]I know there was.
[159:01.06]Alright, for the new viewers that are coming in, you guys really want this to be the chat experience?
[159:08.26]Do you want the- the chat expe- so- oh, uh, this is- this channel!
[159:12.38]I've never heard of.
[159:13.90]Oh, Jerma9- Jerma985.
[159:16.10]Let me- let me click on his channel and see what he's doing.
[159:18.98]Oh, Celeste, okay, cool.
[159:21.26]So, how's he doing in Celeste?
[159:23.68]Oh, I almost missed that one.
[159:25.00]You- you try- try to get that one again.
[159:26.36]He's farting!
[159:28.24]I'm farting!
[159:28.88]I love to fart!
[159:30.66]Uh-
[159:31.97]Okay, well, bye.
[159:35.63]They're gonna think you guys are bots.
[159:43.67]Do you guys really want to be bots?
[159:46.20]Like... I barely enjoyed the luxuries that our hotel has to offer.
[159:59.89]I don't know, man.
[160:00.55]The viewers are going up.
[160:09.18]No, they're not.
[160:09.80]No, they're not.
[160:10.92]They've been the same.
[160:13.84]You've lost 600.
[160:14.38]Oh, heaven.
[160:18.91]What?
[160:26.31]God, seriously.
[160:27.95]Seriously, I don't know what to say.
[160:32.83]I missed dialogue.
[160:35.69]One person wrote that, and then everybody decided to jump on it and start grabbing it.
[160:42.03]She hates you.
[160:43.50]I don't.
[160:44.12]I'm sorry.
[160:44.60]Wait, I thought I couldn't hear that.
[160:47.56]Well, I guess because he's a ghost, you can see right through his brain, so I can see his words.
[160:56.91]I understand.
[160:57.51]Okay.
[160:58.65]Well, let me take a look.
[161:05.07]There is this place that just got opened.
[161:07.67]Didn't I already do this one?
[161:13.57]No!
[161:14.03]Stop Meat Boy!
[161:15.35]Hmm... Ferry?
[161:20.61]Can I get it without dying?
[161:25.23]No.
[161:46.10]Hmm.
[161:47.38]Let's dash across.
[161:48.22]It's very clear.
[161:50.68]It's very clear.
[161:51.17]I gotta fall, grab, dash across.
[161:53.65]Watch.
[161:58.29]I ran a dash.
[162:00.57]See?
[162:06.04]Just fall, dash across, grab.
[162:15.84]I watched you since Scary Face Cam Fridays.
[162:21.74]Oh yeah, I remember those.
[162:24.00]I do.
[162:28.16]Shit, too fast.
[162:30.34]Scary Face Cam Fridays.
[162:35.67]I need to pay attention.
[162:53.83]Now what?
[162:57.81]Bring him back.
[163:02.86]Guys, there's no such thing as scary facecam Fridays.
[163:06.02]You know why?
[163:09.27]Because I'm just...
[163:32.15]I did it on Saturday.
[163:33.15]Yeah, that person's not a true viewer.
[163:36.21]Alright, I'm doing this wrong.
[163:48.35]Well, I fucked it up.
[163:49.07]Maybe not.
[163:52.30]Holy fuck me!
[163:53.88]I did it.
[163:56.14]Holy shit!
[163:57.60]I hate you!
[164:14.77]I'm so in love.
[164:16.83]I'm so in love.
[164:17.97]You know what I mean?
[164:25.53]I've ran out of fucking juice.
[164:34.18]I missed the thing that I needed, and I ran out of juice again.
[164:53.12]Fucking ceiling again, stop hitting the ceiling!
[164:55.53]That's what I call your parents!
[165:26.57]I'm calling both of your parents at the same time, on different cell phones.
[165:38.31]Oh my god, what are you- And then, I'm gonna get them both on the phone, and I'm gonna put them both on speaker and they're gonna talk to each other.
[165:50.08]I'm gonna hold one end to the other.
[165:59.17]I got the game, kid.
[166:00.67]Whatever.
[166:01.69]I cleaned up the house.
[166:08.04]Good for me.
[166:10.48]Wait, hold on.
[166:12.30]What's going on here?
[166:36.03]There you are.
[166:37.29]You certainly have a knack for wandering off.
[166:39.93]It was tough, but I sorted everything out for you.
[166:41.45]The Celestial Resort Hotel extends its gratitude for your assistance.
[166:49.13]Of course, the staff had the mess under control, Ms.
[166:51.87]John.
[166:52.31]Oh, sure, yeah.
[166:56.12]How humiliating.
[166:58.89]Uh, but your pants are unzipped.
[167:01.09]Actually, thanks for telling me that.
[167:02.83]Thank you.
[167:03.15]I'll zip them up.
[167:10.57]It's just up the elevator down the hall!
[167:15.72]Sure, what the heck.
[167:16.70]Show me the presidential suite.
[167:19.06]Sounds lovely.
[167:22.60]Pardon.
[167:28.51]Don't lose her now.
[167:29.41]Oh, I hate it.
[167:34.53]I hate it.
[167:34.93]I hate this.
[167:35.47]This is worse than anything else.
[167:38.25]I hate this thing you guys are doing.
[167:49.96]Whoo-hoo!
[167:50.88]Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[167:55.01]Man, it's amazing here.
[167:56.35]How's it going with El Creepo?
[167:59.38]I helped him clean up that huge mess, but he was kind of a jerk.
[168:02.42]He still thinks he can convince me to stay.
[168:05.62]John, seriously.
[168:06.72]My bad idea radar is off the charts on this one.
[168:10.44]You should get out of here.
[168:11.89]Emote-only mode has been activated.
[168:14.75]If I disappear now, Mr. Oshiro could have a meltdown, and maybe I can actually do something good.
[168:18.45]For once.
[168:21.05]Forget your karma, dude!
[168:22.78]I think that guy is going to meltdown no matter what.
[168:26.42]You have to think about your safety.
[168:29.08]Theo, I'll be okay.
[168:31.16]Yeah, yeah, I didn't expect you to listen.
[168:32.92]See you on the outside.
[168:33.98]Jailbird.
[168:43.47]Give me that.
[168:44.67]Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[168:46.05]First try, guaranteed.
[169:01.51]Holy fuck!
[169:04.61]First try, guaranteed!
[169:05.93]Nope, not first try.
[169:06.61]I gotta get... I hate it.
[169:08.57]I hate the thing you guys are doing right now.
[169:13.98]I've lost it entirely.
[169:15.52]I had it too.
[169:18.50]I just forgot.
[169:19.20]My brain didn't turn it on.
[169:32.71]I'm doing this so incorrect.
[169:35.91]No, I wanted to go up, not diagonal.
[169:38.47]You piece of shit Xbox controller.
[169:41.39]Why are you the worst controller?
[169:43.41]And why are you the only one that works on fucking Steam?
[169:48.13]The PS4 controller doesn't like to work and you have to unplug it and get like a fucking software.
[170:24.41]Okay, I know what I gotta do.
[170:25.43]I know what I gotta do.
[170:26.19]I know what I gotta do.
[170:27.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[170:28.24]Don't grab onto this.
[170:29.34]Grab onto the edge here.
[170:32.54]And you have to... You can't... You gotta go back down.
[170:38.44]Nope, that's wrong.
[170:41.56]Why is everybody putting the cheese?
[170:42.84]Should I even ask that question?
[170:49.16]No, that's it.
[170:49.82]That's what it is.
[170:50.36]You gotta dash, land right on the edge.
[170:57.89]This.
[170:58.33]Run to the edge.
[170:58.85]Got it.
[170:59.47]Bingo.
[171:01.25]Oh shit.
[171:01.87]Oh my GOD!
[171:02.93]I didn't even see what was at the end of this level.
[171:13.18]Stupid Xbox controller.
[171:22.40]Hey, are you sure you don't want to go?
[171:24.24]Hey, when you press and press left on the D-pad sometimes just press press all 180 degrees left down up and every the whole side do the whole thing Did you not want to do that?
[171:43.29]Did you want you didn't want to do that?
[171:44.73]Sorry That'll be $80 per controller, please
[172:11.22]I didn't do that!
[172:12.70]I didn't do that!
[172:13.84]Why do you- hmmmm.
[172:22.84]You didn't- I pressed left.
[172:42.54]By the way, listen to these.
[172:52.54]You know how annoying it is to play a game that requires you to press R1 or L1 more than once every few seconds?
[173:26.45]Cool Xbox.
[173:27.25]See you in like 2030 when Crackdown comes out.
[173:52.89]I'm being, I'm being mean to Xbox right now.
[173:57.95]Why are you being so mean to Xbox?
[174:05.76]Big Bits!
[174:06.22]We got Big Bits!
[174:06.94]Big Bits!
[174:07.70]Uh, Pugatron.
[174:10.72]Gave $30.
[174:14.50]Thank you so much for the 30 bucks.
[174:16.02]Hey, love you, Jerma.
[174:16.95]Thanks for being such a great entertainer.
[174:18.57]Thank you.
[174:19.91]Thanks for hanging out.
[174:20.57]We're just having fun.
[174:21.29]That's all we do.
[174:25.27]This is your last chance, Oshiro, but thank you so much for the $30.
[174:34.87]You already ruined it.
[174:35.75]Making a guest clean up your mess.
[174:37.69]I don't hate the Xbox.
[174:39.56]I don't hate the Xbox.
[174:40.90]I just hate the console.
[174:41.88]I hate the controller.
[174:43.20]I hate the games.
[174:45.00]And I hate the internet connection.
[174:46.90]And I hate the UI.
[174:48.02]I mean, I don't hate the Xbox...
[175:01.66]I'm just kidding!
[175:02.56]I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[175:03.90]You're already ruining it, making the guests clean up your mess.
[175:07.14]She'll never stay.
[175:07.84]No, she's still here.
[175:11.12]There's still a chance.
[175:16.44]Did I just get banned for making a fart joke?
[175:20.44]That's a banned word now.
[175:23.08]Presidential Suite is the key.
[175:24.32]It will surely impress her.
[175:27.82]Get it together or she'll run away.
[175:31.56]But he's doing this.
[175:38.41]There you are!
[175:39.03]Follow me quickly, we're almost there!
[175:41.07]I have a confession to make.
[175:54.73]I actually like the layout of the Xbox controller.
[175:59.70]I prefer the layout to the PS4.
[176:11.30]It's true.
[176:12.66]That actually is true.
[176:15.76]This guy keeps smashing me.
[176:18.84]I literally got banned for saying fart pee pee.
[176:23.26]Well, maybe you shouldn't be saying fart pee pee.
[176:33.38]Will you guys just let me enjoy my pizza?
[176:36.36]Shit!
[176:44.14]That's what you have to do though.
[176:55.25]And I fucking blew it.
[176:56.39]I blew it so bad.
[176:57.45]I gotta leave the last couple of pixels.
[177:04.87]Oh, I'm going to get angry.
[177:07.51]No, I'm not.
[177:07.99]Why?
[177:08.19]This game's fun.
[177:10.11]I'm not actually getting angry at anything in this game.
[177:27.20]Come on!
[177:28.50]Come on!
[177:30.70]Stay still.
[177:31.14]Got it.
[177:33.99]We need sub only?
[177:35.15]Sometimes we have to go to sub only because people, right, fart?
[177:38.17]Farts.
[177:39.31]Look, I'm farting.
[177:40.19]It's the only thing that I get to see in chat and we're gonna, we're gonna sour?
[177:43.80]I don't!
[177:52.42]Where's the key?
[177:55.49]We gotta stop bringing it up.
[177:58.99]When people are asking why am I getting timed out and they write the thing, I have to answer it.
[178:04.21]I have to tell them why.
[178:25.19]Berry up there.
[178:26.41]Two berries, really?
[178:32.58]I'm going to grab and then climb.
[178:35.16]Okay, they move very fast.
[178:36.50]Nope, nope.
[178:52.50]I have to climb over and then dash and then jump around, dash again, and land over here.
[178:56.98]This is too very retarded.
[178:58.36]I can't just not get them.
[178:59.58]God, what are you doing, Jeremy?
[179:15.33]Land!
[179:15.67]Just land!
[179:16.35]Just land and you'll get it!
[179:30.29]Co-op juke?
[179:31.15]Nice.
[179:31.79]Open up the baby gate.
[179:42.36]What's the baby gate?
[179:46.34]Open the baby gate.
[179:59.94]I just itch the back of my head really fast.
[180:02.04]That's how you know that things are starting to heat up.
[180:04.80]Big time.
[180:05.32]I just ruined everything.
[180:09.25]I have to dash across.
[180:10.73]I can't use this dash.
[180:13.69]You slow, stupid idiot.
[180:15.27]Like, you fucking... Look at how slow that guy is in comparison to the other one.
[180:44.64]Nothing else, right?
[180:49.56]I think that's all I can do down here.
[180:53.00]I gotta go back up?
[180:54.74]Yes.
[180:55.08]Let's go.
[180:57.48]Because there's this way, and I came from this way.
[181:05.91]I gotta get a key.
[181:06.61]Let's go over here and get the key.
[181:12.13]Madden and Hotline Miami?
[181:14.62]That is... That is so far from the truth.
[181:20.19]I'm having a... This is great.
[181:28.26]Well, I have to dash through.
[181:29.72]It's my own fault.
[181:40.70]Got the key, but there's a secret and there's something over here.
[181:45.78]Do I keep this key forever?
[181:50.32]God, I hope so.
[181:51.68]I do.
[181:54.08]I gotta time that to jump when it comes up.
[182:04.15]Oh shit, I get it, I get it!
[182:05.73]Oh my god, I had it right there, that was dumb!
[182:20.57]I get it.
[182:20.95]I get it.
[182:21.29]I get it.
[182:21.83]What are you doing?
[182:36.52]And I just pressed A for no reason.
[182:40.53]For no reason.
[182:41.67]There wasn't any reason to press A. You just slide down.
[182:45.48]I itched my bucket nose.
[182:47.80]I have, like, birds up there.
[182:50.20]I don't know what's in there.
[182:51.22]Why is my nose so itchy right now?
[182:59.47]Why is my nose so itchy?
[183:04.75]Yeah.
[183:06.03]I've...
[183:08.81]Okay.
[183:09.07]Does anybody else get like this?
[183:12.17]When you play a game that requires your complete, immediate, 100% focus, do you go into a spell of where a place on your body starts to itch and you can't con- it doesn't stop?
[183:25.22]I don't know why.
[183:31.26]What's it for?
[183:31.92]What does that mean?
[183:34.12]Does that mean like somebody's talking about you?
[183:41.51]You know when you sneeze and people say, oh, that means somebody just talked shit about you.
[183:48.18]Got a B-side.
[183:54.79]3,000 people are talking about you.
[183:55.67]Well, stop, because my nose is itchy.
[183:59.44]It's Mr. Oshiro's diary.
[184:02.36]Final entry appears to be decades old.
[184:04.22]As of today, the hotel is officially closed.
[184:06.98]Charlotte organized the staff for a farewell hike up the mountain.
[184:10.36]Most of us have never seen the summit.
[184:12.52]It seemed like a fitting goodbye, but when the time came, I couldn't bear to leave without looking around one last time.
[184:19.05]I told them to go on without me.
[184:26.40]I will catch up with them soon after I double check that everything is in order.
[184:29.26]I can't believe my time here is over.
[184:31.51]What am I going to do now?
[184:35.37]Perhaps I'll stay one last night so that the hotel and I can have a proper goodbye.
[184:56.43]Alright, what is going on in this chat today?
[185:00.05]What's going on here?
[185:04.89]Somebody like sawed open chat's head and like threw up into their brain and then closed it.
[185:11.49]What is going on today?
[185:20.61]We had too much sugar.
[185:38.71]This is gonna be... Okay.
[185:41.60]Damn, up.
[185:43.88]Just gonna climb and then across.
[185:46.35]Holy shit, up.
[185:47.77]No, what?
[185:48.97]Oh god, I just had to slide.
[186:09.41]Climb it.
[186:13.27]Climb it.
[186:14.75]Alright.
[186:15.21]So we've got a... Up, drop, up.
[186:22.67]It's gonna be kinda hard.
[186:26.07]We're good.
[186:27.45]That's it, right?
[186:28.03]Nothing up here that I can... What the fuck would I do that for?
[186:32.74]I don't know what I did that for.
[186:34.56]Who... Why would I do that?
[186:50.17]Uh-oh.
[186:51.67]Oh no, am I going to get chased by the image again?
[186:58.55]Here we are, our award-winning presidential suite.
[187:00.59]Truly, it is the very definition of rustic luxury.
[187:03.93]I'll stand back and allow you to soak in the majesty.
[187:06.93]I understand it can be a lot to handle.
[187:08.29]Uh-oh.
[187:10.64]Don't look in the mirror.
[187:12.74]Don't look in the mirror after midnight.
[187:15.76]You're like a gremlin.
[187:17.44]The gremlin's going to come out and start chasing you.
[187:18.94]So, what do you think?
[187:21.37]It's beautiful.
[187:22.65]The furniture looks expensive.
[187:23.99]It's very spacious.
[187:25.78]Colors are elegant.
[187:30.38]I can tell you put a lot of work into it.
[187:41.61]I can tell you put a lot of work into it.
[187:43.85]I knew it would impress you.
[187:44.87]Yeah.
[187:50.72]So, can I get on the roof from here?
[187:53.84]You imbecile, you're losing her.
[187:55.16]Oh, I almost forgot to mention.
[187:56.91]Valued guests such as yourself stay in our finest accommodations at half price.
[188:01.61]I don't want to stay.
[188:04.85]Please, Miss John, please stay.
[188:06.45]Mr. Shiro, I've already been sidetracked too long.
[188:11.46]No, you know I have to do the thing where I run away.
[188:13.72]John, sweetie, forget this loser.
[188:19.80]Loser?
[188:21.66]You're in denial, old man.
[188:23.02]This resort is a dump.
[188:25.30]No one would ever want to stay here.
[188:28.62]Someone had to say it.
[188:31.46]She doesn't mean that.
[188:34.07]I... I'm very busy.
[188:48.00]You heard the man.
[188:53.70]Where would you be without me?
[188:58.62]Sad because bad.
[188:59.72]Sad because bad.
[189:00.75]Sad because bad.
[189:01.81]Mad because sad.
[189:02.83]Sad because bad.
[189:07.29]Mad because sad.
[189:08.37]Sad because bad.
[189:09.43]Bad because mad.
[189:10.49]Mad because sad.
[189:11.51]Sad because bad.
[189:12.63]Bad because sad!
[189:14.31]I figured out the whole algorithm.
[189:19.48]Why would she say my beautiful tell the dump?
[189:25.62]You got more?
[189:26.20]How dare she insult you like that?
[189:29.02]You done?
[189:29.48]No, you got more.
[189:31.92]What if she's right?
[189:35.20]Of course she's right.
[189:36.28]You couldn't even clean up without her help.
[189:40.59]That's right.
[189:43.81]John Lee wanted to help.
[189:48.23]But why was she so cruel?
[189:51.32]How dare she insult you like that?
[189:52.70]I got a ball.
[189:53.39]No, I didn't.
[189:55.11]What if she's... No, I did get a ball.
[189:56.39]Okay, fine.
[189:56.73]Let's go.
[190:01.05]I thought we'd never get rid of him.
[190:02.67]You owe me one.
[190:03.91]And add it to the list.
[190:06.48]Leave me alone.
[190:08.88]I thought you were so determined to keep climbing.
[190:11.64]Now all of a sudden you're some weirdo's therapist.
[190:16.02]Why won't you go away?
[190:22.16]Miss John, before you go, I need to ask a question.
[190:25.57]Why would you be so nice to me only to run away?
[190:29.05]What did I do wrong?
[190:31.69]Oh, give it a break.
[190:32.51]You still don't get it.
[190:34.25]She only helps people to feed her twisted ego.
[190:37.26]She never cared about you.
[190:40.82]Cha-ah!
[190:41.88]I just wanted to help.
[190:44.00]You're both pathetic.
[190:45.22]Uh oh.
[190:50.39]Pathetic.
[190:52.23]You only came here to humiliate me.
[190:56.31]I won't ruffle your feet any longer.
[190:57.99]Boss fight.
[191:04.92]Okay.
[191:07.98]Secret, over there.
[191:14.85]Alright, let's go.
[191:15.81]He's gonna be able to do dashes.
[191:17.38]I get it.
[191:19.36]It's super easy once you know what happened.
[191:28.38]Ooh, almost got me that time, didn't ya?
[191:46.35]Not today.
[191:47.03]Uh-oh, I missed a strawberry.
[191:49.59]Who cares?
[191:57.74]What are you thinking?
[191:58.52]I tried... Fucking Xbox.
[192:00.24]Fucking Xbox.
[192:03.58]Unbelievable.
[192:04.38]Xbox tilted the wrong way.
[192:06.36]Xbox, tilt controller.
[192:10.46]Hey, Xbox, tilt controller sideways instead of up.
[192:31.13]Did he come in here?
[192:37.91]He's tilting.
[192:39.15]He's tilting.
[192:40.32]I'm gonna name this stream Celeste.
[192:47.42]Legend of the Tilted Streamer.
[192:49.88]Right?
[192:50.78]That'd be like funny.
[192:52.83]What an awesome title that would be.
[193:21.16]Oh my god, I just figured out a brand new mechanic to the game!
[193:31.14]You can actually step on his head!
[193:38.26]Oh, thank you!
[193:39.96]No, don't do it that fast, just wait for him.
[193:53.27]Beautiful.
[193:58.23]Oh, that kind of threw me off.
[194:07.54]How do I end this?
[194:11.16]No, no, no, no, no.
[194:12.00]I want to jump on his head here.
[194:18.06]I didn't even see the goo on the ground.

[194:43.96]Oh, wait a minute.
[194:48.16]Hold on.

[197:22.22]Might as well show you.
[198:01.85]Stop your hurting him.
[198:03.01]What?
[198:04.42]No!
[198:07.06]It's water.
[198:07.68]Fucking god damn it.
[198:08.91]Why don't...
[198:44.84]Thank you.
[199:20.97]Thank you.
[199:50.68]Hold on.
[199:50.96]I hope I didn't get liquid in the keyboard.
[199:54.74]No, it went forward into the... Like, splashed on the monitor and on the desk and everything.
[200:02.06]Thank God this is just water.
[200:03.18]If this was coffee or something, I would be fucking so mad.
[200:05.70]I would have turned the stream off in rage.
[200:08.27]It would be the second time I would have done that.
[200:12.21]No, it's alright.
[200:12.77]It's just water.
[200:14.25]It's just kind of everywhere.
[200:15.45]Hold on.
[200:15.93]I gotta, like, tip this.
[200:17.21]Hold on.
[200:17.67]This is gonna be really loud, so I need to mute.
[200:19.37]Hold on.
[200:33.05]Thank you.
[201:14.83]Alright, what the fuck is going on now?
[201:16.35]My screen just went all green.
[201:19.31]And it just said I had the wrong cable connected.
[201:22.60]I just got you.
[201:23.18]You have the wrong cable connected to your monitor.
[201:26.54]Get a DBI cable.
[201:27.52]That's what's in there.
[201:30.06]The water didn't even get there.
[201:31.70]No, that's completely unrelated somehow.
[201:35.17]But I fucked this all up because now the screen is in the wrong spot and that's going to throw me off.
[201:41.20]Alright, we're good.
[201:41.98]Let's go.
[201:43.38]Hey, uh, want some water?
[201:44.46]Mmm!
[201:50.41]Wish I had more of that.
[201:52.75]Unbelievable.
[201:53.27]Let's go.
[202:00.05]I've decided to close the hotel for repairs.
[202:01.91]Will we dry?
[202:02.93]Kind of.
[202:03.61]It's alright, it'll dry.
[202:06.10]Second floor is leaking, the library is in complete disarray, and not to mention the hole in the ceiling of the presidential suite.
[202:13.37]Please just leave me alone.
[202:19.35]Is the flute thing okay?
[202:20.99]Let me check.
[202:23.43]You alright?
[202:23.81]It means yes.
[202:29.97]Chapter complete.
[202:34.83]You're hurting it.
[202:37.06]This thing is so cute.
[202:38.86]You know why I like this thing so much?
[202:41.36]Because it looks like Pac-Man, doesn't it?
[202:43.18]And yes, I know.
[202:43.82]Cut your nails.
[202:44.68]Cut your nails.
[202:45.42]It's been a rough fucking few weeks.
[202:57.13]Chapter complete.
[203:01.45]21 out.
[203:01.63]I almost got them all.
[203:09.51]Name the automaton?
[203:10.89]Let me see.
[203:24.21]It's got a face.
[203:24.97]It's got an interesting face.
[203:26.07]Shito.
[203:39.32]Shito?
[203:40.68]Little Shito.
[203:48.47]Shito.
[203:50.93]S-H-E-E-T.
[203:57.85]Awful name?
[203:58.72]Why?
[203:59.14]This little Shito.
[204:11.26]Alright, whatever, let's go.
[204:13.16]We're almost to the top of the mountain, look!
[204:18.18]Golden Bridge, chapter four.
[204:24.14]Low on energy in a pinch, jumping away from walls doesn't consume stamina.
[204:30.21]That's a pretty good idea.
[204:33.77]Fluffy clouds, looks like it's a jumping mechanic.
[204:35.87]New mechanic introduced into Shito, I mean Celeste.
[204:41.07]What about down?
[204:42.63]There's an orb.
[204:57.18]Oh.
[204:59.82]Bubble mechanic.
[205:01.34]Oops.
[205:05.51]So you can aim it.
[205:06.51]So you have to aim it in a direction.
[205:07.83]So if I jump in, I come out with a dash.
[205:11.32]Can I jump out of this?
[205:12.32]I wonder if I can jump out.
[205:17.58]Doesn't look like it, but I still have a dash when I'm outside.
[205:19.88]Okay.
[205:21.33]Good to know.
[205:24.99]That's pretty cool.
[205:53.96]Come on, I'm making a reference to Mario 3.
[205:57.64]Any other boomers in this chat get it?
[206:00.13]You probably do.
[206:00.95]You probably went, oh, alright, yeah, I remember that little tune.
[206:11.61]So you made it through the hotel did you meet Mr. Oshiro?
[206:22.38]I did.
[206:22.64]Oh, I met him alright.
[206:26.00]He chased me out of there after I cleaned up a bunch of junk.
[206:33.85]That sounds like a fun morning.
[206:39.32]He's a lost soul, dear.
[206:40.60]That place is much more than just a hotel to him.
[206:42.66]Don't make him your project.
[206:45.82]You know what I think?
[206:47.36]I think this mountain drove both of you crazy.
[206:52.57]You know, you're not the first person to say that.
[206:56.99]Maybe you're right.
[206:57.55]How would I know if I were crazy?
[207:00.99]The way I see it, the mountain can't bring out anything that isn't already in you.
[207:06.89]but you gotta be a few crows short of a murder to live up here in the first place, right?
[207:14.40]What are you even talking about?
[207:15.68]Oh, I'm just rambling like the old bat I am.
[207:19.87]Ready to give up?
[207:20.45]I know a shortcut back to your car.
[207:25.53]Back off, lady.
[207:27.68]I'm heading for the summit.
[207:30.46]Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between stubbornness and determinationism.
[207:34.96]You remind me of myself when I was young.
[207:39.19]Good luck and mind the wind.
[207:45.55]You don't get many visitors up here, do you?
[207:48.15]No, I can't say that I do.
[207:49.35]I don't mind the solitude, though.
[207:52.08]Sometimes I think I should live in solitude, too.
[207:54.16]I really tried to get through to Mr. Oshiro.
[207:57.52]I wanted to help him.
[207:59.72]Sure needs to move on from that hotel.
[208:01.42]But it's not going to happen on your schedule.
[208:04.50]And it doesn't help that you've got something to prove.
[208:08.16]I'm talking very strangely.
[208:09.32]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[208:10.44]I don't know.
[208:10.86]Why am I doing this?
[208:11.58]Why am I saying it like this?
[208:12.36]Why am I doing this?
[208:13.25]Why am I doing that?
[208:22.71]This is the arrow pointing up.
[208:26.49]You've got an arrow that's pointing.
[208:27.71]Look at that arrow right there pointing up.
[208:30.94]For what?
[208:33.48]That's very clearly an arrow.
[208:42.74]Right there, look, see?
[208:45.24]Where my head is hitting.
[208:50.22]Don't you get lonely in that little cabin?
[208:52.39]I have friends, dear.
[208:53.59]I may be crazy, but I'm not a hermit.
[208:57.09]Well, isn't that interesting?
[208:57.75]Isn't that just interesting?
[208:59.09]Too much wind.
[209:35.28]No, I don't like this.
[209:39.85]Those are spikes.
[209:40.99]I thought they were just frozen cactuses, but I'm wrong.
[209:43.75]There ain't no cactuses in Canada.
[210:08.04]Wait, can I go?
[210:09.20]Okay.
[210:10.40]These can be broken.
[210:18.12]Donkey Kong barrels, nice!
[210:19.52]Alright, nothing else I can do about this.
[210:27.20]No secrets.
[210:27.86]Ooh, that's... Does he come back?
[210:36.74]Oops-a-daisy.
[210:47.93]More wind, more wind.
[210:54.54]You know, this game is like Dark Souls, in a way, with, uh...
[211:08.55]I'm sorry.
[211:09.09]I'm sorry.
[211:09.75]I'm just being annoying.
[211:11.16]Oh, actually, they don't even count the dash.
[211:16.22]Stop right now.
[211:17.22]Yeah, I don't know.
[211:18.72]It's something about the way that the, uh, you know, you die, and it's, you're supposed to lose a bunch of times.
[211:25.83]It's kind of, it makes sense.
[211:30.47]Oh, man, you gotta go faster than that to get this.
[211:50.06]Really really really I didn't even point it and
[212:15.61]I'm gonna grab the ledge.
[212:18.03]Ding dong.
[212:30.24]Easiest barrier the whole game right there.
[212:33.48]Official death counter, 5 out of 75.
[212:35.22]575 death.
[212:35.78]That's not bad for a playthrough 1, is it?
[212:46.58]That's not bad.
[212:49.48]That's not bad.
[212:53.46]Something down here?
[212:57.14]We got a raid?
[212:58.53]Raid coming in from Joel?
[213:05.47]We got a Joel raid?
[213:07.89]Ooh.
[213:13.82]Well, welcome, everybody.
[213:17.82]Welcome to the channel.
[213:21.79]Thanks a lot Joel.
[213:23.39]If you're here playing Celeste.
[213:27.31]Trying so fucking hard.
[213:29.41]I don't mean to turn you away.
[213:32.25]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[213:42.71]Here's if you don't know what Celeste is.
[213:44.11]Celeste is a puzzle platformer RPG where I get skill points that I put in at the end of every level.
[213:51.45]I have a 32 strength, 21 faith, and 5 into Magic Find.
[214:00.71]So that's how I'm finding these little droplets here.
[214:02.65]It's kind of like Dark Souls in a way.
[214:09.52]No, but honestly, I hope you had a good stream, Joel.
[214:11.54]Welcome, everybody.
[214:15.70]And if you're not following Joel, I suggest you do.
[214:20.91]Got a great, great goddamn channel over there.
[214:24.15]Please link it.
[214:24.59]Can one of the mods link that channel?
[214:29.03]By the way, I need to figure out what the hell I'm doing here.
[214:31.93]Do I have a time limit on when I can order a certain order?
[214:50.69]I don't think I'm getting this.
[214:55.32]Maybe it does have to be in a certain order.
[214:57.20]Or if they go fast enough where they don't touch me?
[215:01.88]Joel got timed out?
[215:03.96]How?
[215:04.90]What?
[215:05.16]Yeah, I have to go fast.
[215:06.58]They can't touch me.
[215:09.17]He posted the link and got banned.
[215:11.37]No, he didn't.
[215:12.07]Oh, God.
[215:12.65]Let's start at the top left here.
[215:25.13]Where's the sounds?
[215:27.73]He did because he's not a sub.
[215:29.96]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to time... I didn't mean for the automatic bot to time you up.
[215:42.83]Wait, it's still here.
[215:48.87]You were supposed to learn this in Chapter 2, but you skipped it like a dumbass.
[215:53.96]What do you mean, like, what do you, hold on, what do you mean like a dumbass?
[215:57.32]Because I went a different way?
[216:01.69]What?
[216:01.93]Alright, so I can't touch the ground.
[216:17.22]That does not count as the floor.
[216:18.34]Hmm, so I probably have to start over here then.
[216:30.78]No.
[216:36.68]The thing is, you got... The grip thing is really gonna fuck me over here.
[216:41.48]Because I have to touch the ground, so... I gotta wait till the wind.
[216:51.95]That's how you do this, I bet.
[216:54.05]Does this count as the ground?
[216:55.59]This doesn't count as the ground, does it?
[217:07.73]This wind is killing me here So how the hell am I gonna get this one?
[217:21.60]Dash through?
[217:22.42]Well, I think that's what I have to do No I was on the right track
[217:44.07]Can I grab that from here?
[217:51.02]Maybe this is... This one's... I feel like I have to dash to get this one.
[217:56.94]Dashing with the wind.
[217:59.30]Or get it absolutely last.
[218:00.68]Let's try it again.
[218:04.04]Okay.
[218:16.97]Yeah, I gotta get this one.
[218:18.01]And then this one last.
[218:21.45]I shouldn't be dashing at all.
[218:23.65]Except for to get this one.
[218:33.06]Fuck.
[218:34.10]I'm not gonna get it.
[218:39.70]It's possible!
[218:40.34]Ugh!
[218:46.27]If I had a dash, it was impossible.
[218:58.00]Alright, let me take a look.
[219:00.76]So... No.
[219:10.95]Maybe if I drop down...
[219:16.78]No, I shouldn't be dashing.
[219:21.18]Ran into the dash again.
[219:25.86]This is Celeste, if you're wondering.
[219:27.74]If you're curious what the game is.
[219:38.43]No.
[219:41.23]What if I get this one first?
[219:47.95]That may have just done it.
[219:49.49]Because I can reset it every time over here.
[219:55.34]Alright, that should be it, right?
[220:03.26]As long as I can get over here.
[220:04.14]Got it.
[220:07.60]No!
[220:08.22]Got it.
[220:12.06]I thought I was gonna run out of grips.
[220:16.46]Alright, that was fun.
[220:18.78]Interesting, so you gotta get them all before touching the ground.
[220:20.52]Cool!
[220:21.08]Just took me a little while.
[220:25.68]Step two.
[220:30.47]Oh, god.
[220:33.83]Welcome to hell.
[220:34.53]This is gonna take a lo- No, it's not.
[220:35.61]I'll get it first try.
[220:36.37]Guaranteed.
[220:36.93]Or I'll delete my Twitch channel right now.
[220:43.81]Still first try?
[220:59.45]Thank god I don't have to delete my Twitch channel.
[221:04.79]Another B-side tape.
[221:05.55]Very cool.
[221:10.08]Can I go anywhere else?
[221:14.12]Looks like I can go up.
[221:16.90]But can I really, though?
[221:21.36]Geel9!
[221:22.08]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[221:23.30]Geel9!
[221:29.11]You guys are giving so many community subs tonight.
[221:35.29]Geel, thank you.
[221:38.95]Nothing up here anyways.
[221:42.94]Geel.
[221:49.70]Alright, fight the wind.
[221:50.58]I got my berry, I got the tape.
[222:02.20]I just have to guess where it is.
[222:04.80]Just guess correctly this time.
[222:07.02]Oh my god, what are you thinking?
[222:11.36]Why can I not do this?
[222:14.12]What the fuck am I doing?
[222:17.59]Almost soiled it there, but I got it.
[222:19.11]Alright, berry right there.
[222:29.08]Don't do it like that.
[222:29.76]There's no reason to do it like that.
[222:31.82]Alright, climb.
[222:34.34]Probably have to time this to when it's not snowing.
[222:38.67]I mean, windy.
[222:39.85]You know what I mean.
[222:42.21]What if I go the other way?
[222:43.25]No.
[222:49.02]That was it.
[222:49.42]I had it.
[222:59.00]I think I have to hold on and not do the dash.
[223:08.55]Maybe not.
[223:11.86]I gotta wait for the wind to blow me back that way.
[223:16.67]Okay, I get it.
[223:17.43]So let's count it.
[223:17.95]Ready?
[223:18.09]1, 2, 3.
[223:18.15]1, 2, 3.
[223:18.21]1, 2, 3.
[223:18.33]1, 1, 2, 3.
[223:18.45]Oh my god.
[223:18.75]You gotta go when the wind is blowing.
[223:21.99]Right when it starts.
[223:23.91]Get it?
[223:24.73]Come on, blow!
[223:50.25]That was close.
[223:51.19]I really had it there too.
[223:52.53]I'll get it.
[224:04.27]I know it's right.
[224:05.29]I have it.
[224:18.83]Do it!
[224:19.69]I didn't even need the wind.
[224:22.64]Didn't even need it.
[224:32.60]Bite controller.
[224:33.54]No, no biting.
[224:38.58]What we got?
[224:39.74]Spikes, berry, two berries, okay.
[224:53.60]I would assume that's probably correct.
[225:01.68]It is correct.
[225:02.26]If I could just do it.
[225:05.58]That's one.
[225:11.52]And... That's not how you get that one.
[225:18.77]How do you get that one?
[225:25.23]Let me see, hold on.
[225:26.17]Is there a way to go up from here?
[225:31.92]No.
[225:34.20]Well!
[225:34.72]Is this blocked off now?
[225:37.51]Let's try this way.
[225:43.49]That's different.
[226:10.39]Okay, well you this can be controlled with my mind I Have to break that
[226:29.67]Maybe not.
[226:29.91]I'm gonna have to go all the way up and then all the way down?
[226:31.95]Will it fit?
[226:36.87]Apparently, I guess.
[226:42.21]Hmm.
[226:48.59]Maybe I do have to break it.
[226:49.67]No, I don't.
[227:03.41]Ugh, I have to control this too, shit.
[227:07.72]Come with me.
[227:13.34]I forgot to press the button.
[227:14.36]Is this it?
[227:22.41]Did I... Did I do this right?
[227:34.78]Holy shit.
[227:35.62]Okay.
[227:42.58]Just let go, man.
[227:43.70]Just let go.
[227:47.91]I didn't even hold.
[227:49.07]I didn't hold right trigger.
[227:51.65]I'm so... angry.
[228:00.19]Just do it, man.
[228:05.25]I'm really just trying to... Jeremy.
[228:11.38]I'm not going to ask you to do this again.
[228:29.07]It's really... That wasn't that hard.
[228:30.51]You just had to do it.
[228:35.82]Alright, got all the batteries.
[228:39.52]That's it, you're grounded.
[228:41.68]Jeremy, you're grounded.
[228:48.56]Any other ways to go?
[228:50.96]There is.
[228:53.11]What are we looking at?
[228:55.97]There's a way to go to the top right.
[229:03.27]This is gonna be a pain in the ass, I can already tell.
[229:19.40]Oh my god!
[229:21.56]Holy shit.
[229:22.38]Those are spikes!
[229:22.90]No they're not.
[229:23.64]That's how the level is done.
[229:24.63]Good.
[229:24.95]Good for you.
[229:25.49]Got it.
[229:29.71]Oh, there is.
[229:30.19]How do I get up there?
[229:33.51]There's gotta be a way, right?
[229:41.83]Jump on here and then fall, maybe?
[229:44.11]No.
[229:47.41]Because I don't think I can reach.
[229:48.31]No, I can't reach.
[229:59.54]Oh, fuck!
[230:03.59]How do I- can I get that to move?
[230:10.81]Nice, alright.
[230:11.47]So this is the water.
[230:19.82]Why do I always play a game a year after release?
[230:22.08]I mean, do I do that?
[230:28.17]I'm just... I play games.
[230:29.61]I don't have to play a game.
[230:31.65]I guarantee you there's a reference here.
[230:35.99]What the fuck did I tell you?
[230:38.11]I knew it.
[230:39.09]So what do I do with this?
[230:56.40]Yep.
[230:58.45]Everybody talked shit when I made the flute noise and there's the reference right there and I got it first try.
[231:12.96]Your boomer brain helped.
[231:18.99]Oh, this is gonna be interesting.
[231:20.27]Okay, I gotta go and then jump on this before it crashes in.
[231:24.95]Maybe I have to do that first.
[231:26.05]Is that even possible?
[231:32.21]Holy shit, man.
[231:34.97]Got it.
[231:46.08]So that's another heart.
[231:47.38]Cool.
[231:52.50]I didn't go up, though.
[231:54.98]Hmm.
[231:57.51]Interesting.
[232:05.31]I never played Super Mario 3, so it took me 20 minutes to figure that out.
[232:12.29]That's just a white block.
[232:14.47]Why would you ever know what to do if you've never even heard of it?
[232:18.00]Oh, this is on track.
[232:18.86]I can't move it.
[232:25.56]Oh, shit.
[232:30.88]I just have to go the other way.
[232:32.10]I had it.
[232:44.72]Whoops.
[232:45.26]That's gonna screw the whole thing up, isn't it?
[232:49.92]Jexit?
[232:52.04]What is Jexit?
[233:06.75]Don't act like I don't know SHIT!
[233:42.88]No!
[233:46.44]The wind really is tough.
[233:50.38]Why did I scream in your ears?
[233:51.50]I'm sorry.
[233:52.00]Because I'm an awful screamer.
[233:56.70]And I forget how loud noises hurt.
[233:59.37]Alright, this is an interesting scenario here.
[234:02.91]I jump, fall down, dash up.
[234:08.57]I figured the wind would have carried me there.
[234:18.74]That's what you gotta do.
[234:22.61]It's close.
[234:23.67]I'll get it.
[234:27.87]Whoops.
[234:31.57]Patience, myself.
[234:32.67]Patience.
[234:35.35]I'm giving it some pretty decent patience here.
[234:39.71]Alright, so then it's just fall, grab.
[234:41.87]I...
[234:48.47]We love you no matter how loud you scream.
[234:54.72]Maybe I should just get the bubble.
[234:56.20]No.
[235:02.92]Are you calmly mad or just mad?
[235:04.71]I'm just calm.
[235:10.01]I'm just enjoying the video game.
[235:14.49]Got it.
[235:15.65]Yikes.
[235:16.41]Okay.
[235:16.95]That was... Got it.
[235:27.19]Nothing else.
[235:27.69]Just fall.
[235:29.08]Hold on.
[235:32.92]Oh no.
[235:33.60]Oh no.
[235:34.50]Go up to the top.
[235:35.12]Quick.
[235:35.56]Up.
[235:37.32]This game is surprisingly calm and cozy.
[235:45.30]Despite how tough it is.
[235:48.94]Yeah.
[235:52.15]It is.
[235:52.39]Up, maybe?
[235:53.11]Anything?
[235:53.89]Nope.
[236:21.82]Fucking ice cactus.
[236:26.14]Again, I did it again.
[236:29.44]Shit.
[236:32.60]Now I got it.
[236:37.48]Wind is going the other direction now.
[236:52.90]Yeah, typically I would play a game like this for only a few hours at a time.
[236:58.84]Because they can really just get inside your brain.
[237:03.08]Gotta go up.
[237:05.64]But I'm still, this is still, I like it.
[237:08.70]Oops.
[237:14.60]From here, uh, ride the platform with a bubble.
[237:20.74]And then bubble up.
[237:28.37]I just freaked out because... Oh shit!
[237:36.35]I thought I was gonna need to jump.
[237:39.02]It's gonna put me right here.
[237:40.26]Perfect.
[237:45.62]That's what you gotta do.
[237:46.70]You gotta just... That's what you gotta do.
[237:59.91]Alright, I'm gonna pantomime something and I want you to know I want you to guess what it is, okay?
[238:09.00]No, I'm not it was the Xbox controller surprise I don't have
[238:36.03]Give me the berry.
[238:39.65]That's not what pantomime means?
[238:41.19]Yeah, well, I was gonna do it, but I decided against it.
[238:43.27]Uh-oh.
[238:52.06]Did I ruin it?
[238:55.06]No, I'd rather... I would rather die than have to do that.
[239:07.06]Fucking Xbox.
[239:07.66]Looks like I'm going this way.
[239:13.48]Because I have to.
[239:17.06]What the fuck am I doing?
[239:42.12]Let's think this through.
[239:48.30]Let me see what happens when I touch this.
[239:53.04]Right.
[239:54.15]Okay, right.
[239:55.85]Right, okay.
[239:56.77]We gotta catch it on the way back.
[240:11.36]no right right right right right right what you gotta do and I'm just not getting that's what you gotta do you gotta do it quick bingo one
[240:40.00]That's not what you gotta do.
[240:41.32]You have to grab the edge.
[240:43.48]I gotta grab the edge.
[240:49.48]You fucking got it.
[240:52.89]Idiot.
[241:01.25]Come in.
[241:12.63]It's not possible without the thing.
[241:14.53]Yes it is.
[241:16.27]Don't ever tell me it's not possible.
[241:27.07]It's not possible.
[241:28.51]Oh.
[241:29.11]Go down.
[241:42.27]Do this.
[241:43.81]Okay, go ahead.
[241:46.07]I gotta go ahead, right?
[241:48.27]I would have had it.
[242:02.79]Bring it up.
[242:05.51]Good.
[242:05.95]Very good, very good, very good, very good.
[242:16.84]So pretty this is a very pretty game, isn't it?
[242:25.94]I agree probably should hold on secret No Wait, can I go up?
[242:36.02]No
[242:50.23]Gotta check for secrets.
[242:51.07]It's possible.
[242:51.65]There's probably something here.
[242:52.61]I don't know.
[242:57.69]You gotta check.
[243:10.12]Down, down, right.
[243:12.20]Fucking video game controllers, man.
[243:17.90]I swear.
[243:21.45]There's a huge- that's a- it's a big conspiracy I think.
[243:46.26]What the fuck are you- what's happening to the controller?
[243:51.76]I swear to God.
[243:53.72]Oh, man.
[244:00.96]I did it.
[244:07.98]And root.
[244:09.58]No fruit.
[244:22.44]There's a hole right here, though.
[244:34.10]Let's take a look.
[244:42.91]This looks like hell.
[244:44.29]Sure, let's do it.
[244:52.83]Have you tried turning on the controller?
[244:56.45]Um, there's one thing I actually haven't tried is turning it on.
[244:59.77]I'm using my teeth to play.
[245:03.18]Alright, very clearly I have to jump off.
[245:22.48]And you also have to pull it.
[245:35.08]And I jumped over it.
[245:45.77]Running out of gas here.
[245:47.91]Running out of gas!
[245:48.87]I gotta be on the other side.
[246:03.20]Oh, you dumbass.
[246:13.64]My hands are just covered in fucking water.
[246:15.62]Just sweating my ass off.
[246:22.21]My hands are sweating.
[246:23.15]I'm like a dog.
[246:27.89]You know how a dog doesn't sweat?
[246:29.53]It only sweats, like, through his mouth?
[246:31.59]I don't know.
[246:33.69]I didn't even know.
[246:34.31]I didn't even know, and I would have known.
[246:35.67]If I'd known, I would have known.
[246:36.55]Yeah, I'm sweating through my hands right now.
[246:43.82]It's the only part that's sweating.
[246:47.00]Did I get it?
[246:54.80]Oh, I'm so happy.
[247:03.64]Drink from your hands.
[247:04.77]I'm not sure that's a good idea.
[247:12.47]Berry?
[247:13.15]Hmm.
[247:14.39]You probably have to... just dash only?
[247:25.82]Oops.
[247:26.38]Because jumping is not going to help, I don't think.
[247:29.86]Maybe it will.
[247:36.69]You gotta get to the very edge.
[247:42.51]Wait.
[247:48.78]Try hitting jump in that.
[247:53.32]I didn't know you could do this.
[247:55.92]You can do this, you can actually, there's an actual dash jumping.
[248:13.12]New mechanic.
[248:13.80]And I didn't even learn it.
[248:14.66]Somebody told me about it.
[248:19.26]Just do it!
[248:20.12]Oh!
[248:20.26]Just do it!
[248:29.45]Hold on.
[248:29.75]Sorry, guys.
[248:30.15]I have to get the layer of oil off my hands.
[248:33.91]Just do it.
[248:49.17]How's that for a gamer challenge?
[248:52.35]My hands are covered in, like, oil.
[248:57.46]Hold on.
[249:00.24]No!
[249:00.82]No, I turned on the camera and it stopped!
[249:07.70]That's gonna haunt me for three days now.
[249:09.04]I'm not gonna be able to sneeze for three days.
[249:14.57]Fuck.
[249:17.15]Why did I do that?
[249:28.91]The wind.
[249:30.87]The wind.
[249:34.23]No, it's not enough!
[249:42.09]Why is it not letting me jump up?
[249:45.99]Is this because of the wind?
[249:53.93]I don't think I can do this alright now I can holy you got it oh boy you gotta go fast my hands have fallen off the controller thank god
[250:24.86]Got hit in the face with snowball.
[250:29.04]Oh, this sucks.
[250:31.34]I hate this wind.
[250:32.75]I hate the wind!
[250:34.13]I don't like the wind.
[250:37.69]I'm playing tug-of-war with the video game right now.
[250:53.62]Oh, fuck!
[250:55.21]Itchy face.
[251:02.51]Stop it!
[251:03.79]Just go!
[251:05.39]What am I doing?
[251:06.45]It's alright, I got the berry.
[251:07.56]Ah, I didn't have a jump!
[251:27.15]Didn't have a jump.
[251:27.91]I thought I had one still.
[251:34.17]Alright, something I gotta remember.
[251:35.29]That uses a dash when you do that.
[251:38.17]It's not just like a fancy jump.
[251:39.45]It's actually dashing.
[251:54.12]I almost died.
[251:54.82]Good thing I didn't.
[252:06.41]Is this the guy that beat Dark Souls on stream?
[252:08.37]Yep, one of the only ones.
[252:25.08]I have to jump on them.
[252:30.88]This is such extreme win.
[252:39.36]I don't know what I was going for there.
[252:42.06]I don't know what I was doing there.
[252:50.69]Fucking come on!
[252:55.88]No!
[252:56.32]No!
[252:56.66]Oh, I had it.
[252:57.04]It was so close.
[252:57.88]This is the hardest level in the whole game.
[253:09.28]They fall too.
[253:09.98]Oops.
[253:26.45]Oh.
[253:26.71]I overshot it.
[253:33.74]That would have been it too.
[253:34.74]I had it.
[253:57.50]Thank God I don't have a face cam on right now.
[253:59.36]You should see what I'm doing.
[254:30.80]This is the longest I've spent on a level, and this is probably one of the easiest slides in the whole game.
[254:36.90]And I'm still here.
[254:37.56]Oh my fucking god!
[254:59.76]Alright, I did it.
[255:00.38]I just beat the easiest slide in the game.
[255:05.30]Don't do diagonal.
[255:06.52]Blame Phil Spencer.
[255:08.81]It's his fault.
[255:11.47]He owns these controllers, and they're his.
[255:13.45]All of them.
[255:14.15]He sells them out of his fucking truck in his house.
[255:17.11]He makes them in his spare time.
[255:19.00]All of them.
[255:31.76]Did the truck- No, no, no, no.
[255:35.90]Oh my god.
[255:46.93]It's too much.
[255:47.61]I feel like I'm getting the wind blown on me in real life.
[256:02.15]I didn't know what I was doing.
[256:08.11]Well, now I'm going real fast.
[256:18.74]I jumped over.
[256:20.34]How did I jump over?
[256:32.54]I have to go.
[256:38.54]I can't believe it.
[256:41.18]I can't believe I had it.
[256:46.38]Oh, I just have to go underneath it.
[257:10.38]Maybe not.
[257:11.54]I think I'm just doing it wrong.
[257:13.66]Let me sit here for a sec.
[257:16.30]Okay.
[257:18.52]Got it.
[257:20.48]I win.
[257:28.53]John, wait up.
[257:39.69]Nailed it.
[257:42.07]This is the most comical character.
[257:44.63]Theo, you alright?
[257:47.01]Oof.
[257:48.41]Yeah.
[257:49.59]Just give me a second.
[257:56.87]A gondola!
[257:57.43]I've always wanted to ride one of these.
[257:58.65]Looks pretty old, but maybe it still works.
[258:01.99]I don't see any other way to cross this chasm.
[258:06.06]Let's do it.
[258:11.44]This lever looks important.
[258:19.74]Easy every time.
[258:20.70]I was probably gone to the operator in a past life.
[258:23.92]Do you think this is safe?
[258:26.08]I'm sure it's fine.
[258:31.02]How to check out with Oshiro.
[258:34.76]Shouldn't have tried to help him.
[258:36.30]Because I told you so, bud.
[258:39.71]Yeah.
[258:41.45]Should have listened.
[258:42.99]He didn't get hurt, and that's what matters.
[258:48.27]Local boomer can't beat children's platformer.
[258:57.27]I can barely breathe.
[258:58.13]That's bullshit.
[258:58.81]You know that.
[259:03.58]It's not even like, that would... Okay, if we don't get a selfie on this thing, we're gonna regret it.
[259:10.05]Can't even see the ground through the mist.
[259:13.09]This is not a children's platformer, I know.
[259:15.41]And you're gonna have to explain that.
[259:18.01]To... I don't even know who said it.
[259:21.58]I just read it.
[259:22.52]How high up are we?
[259:24.72]Less panicking, more posing.
[259:33.34]Uh, looks like we stalled out.
[259:35.68]This guy's always taking selfies.
[259:43.09]Maybe if I... You broke it.
[259:54.85]Dark World?
[259:57.09]Oh, this really isn't good.
[260:00.10]You cool?
[260:00.62]Uh-oh.
[260:06.74]No, I'm not cool.
[260:08.28]I can't breathe.
[260:08.88]You're having a panic attack.
[260:12.06]Why would you think it's a good idea to ride this stupid thing?
[260:14.14]Don't take it out on me.
[260:16.92]Stay with me.
[260:18.00]My grandpa taught me a trick for this.
[260:19.81]Close your eyes.
[260:23.25]Picture a feather floating in front of you.
[260:26.85]See it.
[260:27.11]Okay.
[260:29.35]Your breathing keeps that feather floating.
[260:32.58]Just breathe slow and steady in and out.
[260:38.14]Am I supposed to do this?
[260:45.05]Oh, it's X. A.
[260:55.38]I have to match this I don't know.
[261:04.19]I don't know how to calm down.
[261:05.89]Okay, I'm trying I know I have to keep it in the box, but There we go nice and easy
[261:33.92]Did I win?
[261:34.34]I mean, I'm not really breathing very well here.
[261:43.45]Lookit, I'm going like... I should be going... See?
[261:54.26]Easy.
[262:08.85]Feeling any better?
[262:11.07]I think so.
[262:11.75]Thanks for helping me calm down.
[262:16.61]How did you know we were going to start moving again?
[262:19.59]Oh, I totally thought we were done for.
[262:25.88]But there is... No, there's a raid up here.
[262:29.50]There's a rare Charizard, and I've got to get the gem up here.
[262:32.92]I'm sorry, what were you saying?
[262:35.62]I don't know.
[262:37.89]LOL.
[262:38.67]LOL.
[262:43.43]Whoa, that's a crazy selfie.
[262:52.12]Chapter complete.
[263:00.52]So who took this picture, is what I want to know.
[263:05.48]Scary, right?
[263:06.30]We don't ever find out who that is.
[263:24.88]Looks like we're almost at the summit, right?
[263:29.12]Got maybe a couple more worlds?
[263:33.85]Mirror Temple, Chapter 5.
[263:42.48]Not close.
[263:49.44]Not even close.
[263:50.44]There are seven total chapters.
[263:55.43]Plus one bonus.
[263:56.31]Okay.
[264:02.27]I wonder if I should break this into two streams.
[264:04.17]What do you think?
[264:04.61]Tomorrow?
[264:05.15]Two?
[264:06.05]Go for like another... Alright, so if I go for like another hour, right?
[264:13.33]would that be like two like five to six two like six hour streams two five hour streams back to back that makes sense right the end worlds are really long okay so after this chapter call it and finish it tomorrow and do the tapes too bonus worlds and b-sides okay
[264:45.85]We'll see where we're at in like another hour or so.
[264:48.17]We'll just take a look.
[264:49.15]Oh man, look at this place, feeling adventurous.
[264:52.47]I don't know.
[264:55.73]You're not going to do the tapes in one stream.
[264:57.43]Well, I mean, I don't plan on... I plan on trying to do some of them.
[265:03.07]Looks pretty dark in there.
[265:05.13]More like a nightmare than an adventure.
[265:08.27]I'll just take a quick... I thought he was going to say selfie.
[265:10.77]Oh, that is what he said.
[265:12.75]He is going to take some pictures.
[265:13.71]This place must be ancient.
[265:16.21]Yo, wait.
[265:17.97]My Instapix followers are going to eat this up.
[265:24.93]You won't do the tapes in one stream.
[265:29.49]I mean, I don't really have an intention to.
[265:32.19]I would try to do one or two of them or three of them or all of them in like 45 minutes.
[265:37.51]Takes about two minutes per level.
[265:39.91]Two minutes per level, five levels per side, two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve.
[265:44.12]Yeah, I'll beat it in probably like 14 minutes.
[265:50.39]Secrets?
[265:50.75]No.
[265:56.58]This place is interesting looking.
[265:58.70]I like the foot sounds.
[266:03.04]That kind of glass sound.
[266:05.50]Sounds good.
[266:08.41]Uh, I don't have a... Is there... Okay, there is a mechanic.
[266:12.71]I can just squish.
[266:20.87]Whoa!
[266:27.89]So they activate when I activate.
[266:29.85]Oh boy.
[266:32.89]Interesting stuff.
[266:33.85]Mirror!
[266:34.39]Uh oh.
[266:38.87]This is Theo's phone.
[266:41.99]Don't panic, John.
[266:43.73]Maybe it just fell out of his pocket.
[266:45.30]I'll give it back to him when I find him.
[266:50.93]That's a cool mechanic.
[266:52.63]I like it.
[266:54.75]Secret right here.
[266:56.81]New bubble.
[266:57.41]It's red.
[266:57.89]Is that... Okay, it does mean something.
[266:59.91]I'm gonna say up.
[267:04.26]Oh boy.
[267:07.82]Left.
[267:08.12]Oh.
[267:16.46]Nope, that ain't gonna work.
[267:27.32]Shit, I can get it.
[267:28.22]I gotta just jump from left to right.
[267:30.60]I got this.
[267:31.34]Now where do I go?
[267:32.42]How do I get out of here?
[267:34.92]Oh shit, I can't get out of here.
[267:38.56]I have to have a dash.
[267:56.77]Alright, so what's the progress route here?
[268:09.15]What are those crystals doing?
[268:12.93]That blue crystal just lit up when I touched it.
[268:15.57]I have to light them all up?
[268:28.29]I definitely have to light these all up.
[268:29.59]There's no way I don't.
[268:34.22]That one.
[268:38.44]I think that's all of them.
[268:41.64]No, not on this side.
[268:45.80]I got them.
[268:46.78]Right?
[268:54.84]Is that just for show?
[268:55.94]Those just actually don't do anything?
[269:00.94]You don't have to light them up, okay.
[269:05.62]Whoa!
[269:13.47]Shit.
[269:14.85]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[269:18.09]I don't know what to do.
[269:19.55]Sit up!
[269:30.14]It's the dash that's screwing my face up.
[269:38.37]Like that, okay.
[269:40.97]Oh my god, Jeremy, you're gonna drive me crazy.
[269:43.43]Oh!
[270:00.93]Okay, I made it.
[270:13.80]Jeremy is what he named his Xbox controller.
[270:17.45]Wait, did I name the Xbox controller?
[270:18.79]Are you talking about...
[270:23.93]This one's easy.
[270:28.27]It is.
[270:29.47]It is.
[270:29.67]Trust me, it is.
[270:30.61]I know it is.
[270:31.19]Watch.
[270:33.54]This one's so easy.
[270:35.54]Just watch.
[270:35.90]Now for this one...
[270:51.97]Grabbing the wave.
[270:53.57]There's a spring on it.
[270:56.23]Alright, so... What are you doing?
[271:06.18]Oh shit, I had it.
[271:08.26]I didn't even need to do that.
[271:24.04]Okay.
[271:24.98]Down.
[271:27.34]Strawberry right here.
[271:38.02]Real talk, strawberries are the best berries.
[271:39.83]You know, I might actually... I might agree with that, but I don't think so.
[271:50.55]Well, that's how you think... Okay.
[271:54.64]It's that easy, apparently.
[271:58.86]Let's see.
[272:12.29]This is my first time watching this stream.
[272:13.77]I won't be coming back.
[272:16.53]Oh, well, I'm sorry.
[272:18.51]Sorry.
[272:20.76]I told you guys to behave!
[272:35.54]We didn't do anything.
[272:46.72]It must have been the smell.
[272:48.12]Same deal with this one.
[272:56.49]Can I make it over here?
[273:02.99]Oh, jeez.
[273:03.73]Okay.
[273:07.47]I get it.
[273:12.09]No, I don't.
[273:21.80]Okay.
[273:23.20]Both sides are open.
[273:25.56]More berries.
[273:29.72]I get it.
[273:31.26]I get a jump, though.
[273:35.25]I know you can do it.
[273:39.89]I'm certain I know you can do this.
[273:41.31]I know you can do it.
[273:43.98]Um...
[274:10.60]That I... I... I know.
[274:25.45]I just figured it out.
[274:27.29]I'm just slowing down.
[274:35.70]I'm just slowing down.
[274:49.23]Remember, this is the gamer fatigue.
[274:52.33]Gamer fatigue sets in and you start to kind of just make fucking dumb mistakes.
[274:57.06]Why am I going here?
[275:05.40]Is there anyone that didn't go?
[275:07.08]Because I went left, I went right.
[275:08.68]Can't go down.
[275:09.36]What about up?
[275:21.15]Back up.
[275:21.57]Oh, I can go the other side.
[275:22.85]Down here?
[275:27.75]No, I already did this one.
[275:28.92]Down?
[275:29.54]I think I got everything here, didn't I?
[275:33.92]I did.
[275:36.04]Uh, dude, gamer fatigue sets in.
[275:39.43]And then you start to make dumb mistakes, and you need to go eat, like, a snack.
[275:48.65]Alright, I'm just gonna leave.
[275:59.41]So, how DO I leave?
[276:02.69]That's a great question.
[276:06.45]Because this is the... Hmm.
[276:07.55]Straight up?
[276:20.39]Isn't that just called regular fatigue?
[276:23.71]No, no, no, no, it's different.
[276:29.52]Hold on, I can grab the edge.
[276:40.78]I got it.
[276:53.06]Come on, I didn't jump.
[276:54.66]Slowing down gamer fatigue sets in.
[276:59.08]Oh fuck.
[277:01.50]Sorry, I gotta... There's that one.
[277:08.95]Nothing else over there, right?
[277:10.73]No.
[277:15.95]Uh-huh.
[277:16.19]I'm gonna have to get in a bubble to go through that one, I think.
[277:21.03]Bubble from the other side.
[277:22.01]There's going to be a bubble all the way to the edge.
[277:23.65]I'm going to bubble my way over there.
[277:26.24]Oops.
[277:31.79]I see... Can I get through that?
[277:33.35]Is that a secret?
[277:35.21]It's not.
[277:43.36]Oops.
[277:44.30]You know, you could just duck, Jeremy.
[277:46.64]That is a possibility.
[277:47.59]Alright, so... I'm gonna take that out.
[277:51.97]So that one goes straight out.
[277:55.35]Let me get the cherry here first, though.
[278:03.18]Bring me back.
[278:03.78]Okay.
[278:05.66]Okay.
[278:11.16]I was trying to Donkey Kong it.
[278:17.83]I probably still can.
[278:23.03]I know I can do it, trust me.
[278:27.56]All the way through!
[278:34.06]Go, go, go, go, go!
[278:38.25]Up?
[278:38.91]Nope.
[278:40.79]So, introducing blades.
[278:42.91]Cool.
[278:47.33]There's the key.
[278:52.49]And a secret, but not really, because I didn't get the thing that was necessary.
[278:56.21]I didn't hit another button somehow.
[279:01.47]Shit.
[279:06.22]I got a great question for all you guys watching.
[279:08.34]Where in the name of God is the door that this key goes to?
[279:11.76]I forget.
[279:12.42]Oh, can I get that?
[279:18.38]No.
[279:38.75]Oh, I see.
[279:39.35]I see that.
[279:40.15]Okay.
[279:40.45]I don't think I... Can I get her labby back in there?
[279:44.93]That's gonna be a pain in the ass to get back in there.
[279:46.33]I see exactly where it is though.
[280:00.38]Yeah, let's go back.
[280:09.87]See, right there.
[280:10.51]I see it.
[280:10.85]Right here.
[280:15.73]Bingo.
[280:17.28]That's the other door.
[280:17.90]So now... Let's finish this.
[280:27.14]And there's a way to go through here.
[280:35.46]Oh shit, I need a bubble, don't I?
[280:37.98]So I gotta take bubble from here all the way through.
[280:48.06]Damn, alright.
[280:52.27]Huh.
[281:04.96]Oops!
[281:05.46]Oops!
[281:13.34]No, stop it.
[281:14.24]Just... I got the super secret berry.
[281:29.58]Nice.
[281:31.56]Now we can get the hell out of here.
[281:36.07]Nothing over there, right?
[281:36.81]Nope.
[281:37.19]Let's go.
[281:44.45]For God's sakes, there's strawberries.
[281:46.01]I just... I mean, I said berry, didn't I?
[281:48.25]I said berry.
[281:49.13]I said berry, right?
[281:51.61]Berry.
[281:52.92]A berry is a... A strawberry is a berry.
[281:54.82]Where's this door?
[282:07.70]I'm gonna be honest with you.
[282:09.56]I have no idea.
[282:10.20]I have no idea where that door is.
[282:14.06]How did I even get in here?
[282:16.68]Well, this is new.
[282:17.76]Found the door!
[282:18.64]Excellent!
[282:36.87]It's Thanos.
[282:40.21]Theo!
[282:40.83]Where are you?
[282:43.13]Hey!
[282:44.15]Uh, why are you inside a mirror?
[282:50.15]I'm pretty sure you're the one in the mirror.
[282:52.85]What happened?
[282:54.81]Well, I was taking a nonchalant mirror selfie.
[282:57.55]You know, it's your boy Theo in this ancient temple, no big deal.
[283:02.75]Hashtag, I refuse to say it.
[283:04.99]Next thing I know, I wake up lying on the ground.
[283:07.89]What does it look like over there?
[283:09.45]How can I find you?
[283:12.27]It's really dark and weird.
[283:14.94]There's, wait, something's coming.
[283:16.64]I'm feeling a strong inclination to run away.
[283:19.12]Be careful, okay?
[283:24.49]It's very dark in here.
[283:31.30]Jump over here.
[283:31.74]Let's see if we can get in there.
[283:33.70]Yes, we can.
[283:36.10]Secrets?
[283:40.52]What about over here?
[283:44.08]I think I see what looks like a secret entrance.
[283:46.50]It is.
[283:47.12]Ooh, it's one of those.
[283:55.58]Ah, there are lanterns.
[283:56.82]Now that makes sense.
[283:58.31]So I gotta go over here.
[283:59.19]Anything else?
[284:01.75]I did it.
[284:03.15]Okay, see ya.
[284:23.33]Need more of those lanterns lit up.
[284:32.34]Nothing.
[284:32.68]I just stay hiding things from me.
[284:36.50]You know what I mean?
[284:39.06]Need to check every single wall.
[284:46.97]Well, that's it.
[284:52.25]You either beat it or you die.
[284:53.97]Let's light this room up though.
[285:06.02]Forget about progression, light it up.
[285:08.08]Oops.
[285:23.33]well uh can you pause yeah sure I'll pause you need to pee you have five seconds one okay that should give you enough time
[285:51.22]Can I get on the other side?
[285:52.90]Probably not.
[285:57.35]Just drag me over.
[285:58.29]Uh-oh.
[285:59.85]No, don't drag me over.
[286:01.33]Could've just went up.
[286:07.25]It was too dark for me to realize that.
[286:13.15]Nothing up there.
[286:13.88]This place is huge.
[286:21.88]Oh my goodness, this place is gigantic.
[286:25.34]Alright.
[286:31.07]What do you want me to do with this?
[286:37.85]Oh yeah.
[286:39.74]It's so big.
[286:44.80]Wrong balloon.
[286:54.70]Secrets?
[286:55.32]No.
[287:01.33]What?
[287:04.89]Let's see what's on the other side.
[287:08.70]Another one.
[287:10.30]That looks secret-y to me.
[287:13.58]It's not.
[287:15.64]So we gotta go right, then jump off the wall.
[287:19.76]Or die.
[287:20.93]Either one...
[287:30.23]Oh, that little space.
[287:31.41]I saw it right at the last second.
[287:32.61]Oh, come on.
[287:37.40]Really?
[287:42.12]Oh, give me a break.
[288:12.66]Fucking Xbox.
[288:19.55]Oh my fucking god.
[288:20.79]I'm gonna return this controller.
[288:22.51]I bought it four years ago.
[288:35.30]So...
[288:37.34]Definitely above the eye.
[288:38.36]Yeah, oh yeah.
[288:40.38]Oh yeah.
[288:41.00]I mean, of course there is.
[288:42.54]There's a key up there.
[288:48.18]Nice and warranty.
[288:51.89]So somehow, there's a... There's a bubble that goes all the way up.
[289:06.78]If the controller has a nice D-pad, yeah.
[289:11.20]The Xbox D-pad, I think, is really bad, though.
[289:16.58]I mean, let's be real.
[289:17.58]It's okay.
[289:18.32]It's got a four-year warranty?
[289:23.39]Okay.
[289:28.31]And from here...
[289:39.02]Ow.
[289:42.32]Switch Pro Controller has a god-tier D-pad?
[289:46.20]Yeah, it does.
[289:47.40]It really does.
[289:49.90]It's got separate buttons, right, for each D-pad?
[289:52.54]Ow.
[290:02.65]Hurry.
[290:13.46]Let's try.
[290:26.33]Damn.
[290:26.93]Now what?
[290:33.19]I got a button.
[290:35.21]Shit!
[290:36.55]I touched the candy crystals and I died.
[290:55.20]Is there a secret?
[290:55.68]There's probably a secret right there.
[290:57.26]I don't know.
[291:01.49]Well, no, never mind.
[291:02.25]I got the key.
[291:04.37]Maybe that's it.
[291:09.01]Down here, I can go back to this huge open area.
[291:14.20]I do have a key, though.
[291:22.13]Is there a door over here?
[291:29.96]um I found the door but I'm not done though not I don't want to go there yet hold on I feel like yeah that's where the door is there's so much more it's all the way to the right giant eyeball monster all the way to the right
[292:07.69]But there's so much more to see.
[292:12.15]Look at this.
[292:14.52]Look at all this bullshit.
[292:15.42]I don't mean bullshit as in bad, I mean just... stuff.
[292:19.26]I don't even know.
[292:37.54]No!
[292:37.92]How did I do this last time?
[292:39.77]I jumped out fast.
[292:44.43]I'm dead.
[292:51.45]I'm trying just to jump out.
[293:00.68]It won't jump out.
[293:01.80]Can I not jump out?
[293:13.29]I guess I don't need to, but... Yeah, I don't... Well, I guess I don't.
[293:19.55]Okay, that's that one.
[293:24.62]Hmm...
[293:43.09]Chat calm down a little.
[293:44.27]Yeah, maybe we'll just have fun there.
[293:46.29]There was some there was some memeing going on earlier How far can I how far can I just climb just climb?
[293:56.48]Ow
[294:18.44]I don't know why I just did that.
[294:23.92]Come on.
[294:25.24]Give me a break.
[294:30.24]I think I need this.
[294:30.98]Yeah, I do.
[294:33.05]It's that one.
[294:48.19]So I went down, I got everything down.
[294:52.27]Yeah, well, I gotta go up there.
[294:53.63]But I'm not really seeing a reliable way to get over here.
[294:58.65]Probably from the other side.
[295:03.01]Alright, let's go back up.
[295:04.93]This way?
[295:06.03]Um...
[295:17.87]Shit, I don't have her.
[295:21.34]No, this is back with the... Some of you guys are going to bed?
[295:34.87]Well, goodnight.
[295:35.97]Have a great night.
[295:36.93]See you tomorrow.
[295:42.83]We're gonna do some more Celeste tomorrow and finish it.
[295:46.70]Get to the end, do some of the bonus stuff.
[295:48.24]Hmm.
[295:52.13]How the hell did I get here?
[295:58.73]I went so quickly through a ton of rooms, I don't remember where the hell I go.
[296:07.76]I wanna say down.
[296:33.30]not this one right was it this way no alright chat help me out here I actually am lost
[296:57.61]Bottom of the temple?
[296:58.65]The bubble that you can go right?
[297:02.64]Oh, this way.
[297:06.30]Thank you!
[297:10.30]Alright, I gotta get on this side.
[297:29.83]Ooh, shit.
[297:30.49]Just gonna make it over.
[297:32.23]Oh, shit.
[297:33.13]Just get across.
[297:41.51]Fuck.
[297:52.26]No, diagonal again.
[297:53.62]Oh, I really... I think I'm gonna use a different controller tomorrow.
[297:56.50]I'm gonna just plug my PS4 in.
[298:00.54]That's really starting to get very, very, very irritating.
[298:06.32]Oh my god.
[298:19.55]Use the keyboard.
[298:20.43]I can't do a platformer with a keyboard.
[298:21.87]I don't know how anyone humanly possibly does that.
[298:26.20]Platform with keyboard?
[298:28.08]It's no way.
[298:30.20]How did I not hit that?
[298:31.16]Come on.
[298:33.40]Some of you guys, like I said, are fucking superhumans.
[298:44.71]Why not?
[298:45.07]Because something about putting my hand down on keys like this and having to use my index finger and my ring finger to move around or my... It just doesn't translate to me.
[299:01.22]It's not like WASD for me.
[299:14.14]Anything else I missed up here?
[299:16.86]I don't think so.
[299:23.20]No, I'm of the opinion that a controller is better in at least a very specific few scenarios.
[299:32.99]Alright, don't touch the ground.
[299:48.19]Oops.
[299:49.53]Well, I'll get this one first.
[300:00.25]I think a lot of third-person games just feel better.
[300:05.39]Platforms feel better with a controller for me.
[300:07.00]Look at that.
[300:19.28]Another cassette.
[300:21.80]Currently unlocking content for tomorrow.
[300:25.38]Let's see.
[300:28.25]I mean, you're just gonna have to go at some point.
[300:33.51]Can I get the whole thing in one go?
[300:35.18]I might be able to.
[300:50.83]Oh my god.
[300:51.35]I gotta get through that.
[300:53.26]It's gotta be right when it switches.
[300:55.86]So it's gotta be one, two, ah!
[300:59.10]Here we go.
[301:01.44]No!
[301:01.98]I had it!
[301:02.38]I don't know why I just freaked out.
[301:07.74]Shit.
[301:12.14]Okay.
[301:16.42]Now what about this one?
[301:21.16]Looks like I could, uh, bounce off the sides here.
[301:28.65]Okay.
[301:30.37]Through, and then, hmm, hold on.
[301:34.65]Because I can't make that jump, so I have to hold on to that, like this.
[301:39.50]Okay, well, you fucking Xboxed me.
[301:41.20]Thanks a lot.
[301:43.88]Just got Xboxed.
[301:45.38]Ready...
[301:55.75]CD!
[301:56.09]Uh, what about down?
[302:05.50]No.
[302:08.10]Cool.
[302:09.26]Secrets that I missed, maybe?
[302:10.60]Not that I can see.
[302:19.79]Okay.
[302:21.63]That takes us... That's the cassette.
[302:26.68]There's nothing else here.
[302:31.50]Down, and then... Did I get everything that I wanted to get?
[302:40.74]I think so.
[302:44.50]I think it's time to leave.
[302:53.70]Yeah, I'm gonna go open the door now That's the gamer fatigue
[303:11.69]I got the cassette.
[303:12.99]Open to the door.
[303:15.07]Wait, what is this here?
[303:17.99]To go back?
[303:18.47]Oh, I'm just curious.
[303:20.88]Is there any reason to go up, or left, or down, or... I don't think so.
[303:25.48]Here we go.
[303:26.24]Well...
[303:45.11]No reason to use the dash until now.
[303:46.79]I don't want to start this whole thing over again.
[304:00.78]I'm going to say down.
[304:05.62]Why?
[304:05.82]No reason to.
[304:08.28]Go now.
[304:21.15]Alright, we've got a couple different directions here.
[304:27.13]How high can I go?
[304:29.22]Alright, well that's... I just stretched.
[304:34.46]I fell so far.
[304:35.44]I've gotta take the... I'm not gonna do that yet.
[304:44.22]I'm gonna go right.
[304:56.63]Mmm, I guess that's the only way to go.
[304:58.89]No, it's not.
[304:59.39]Are you kidding?
[305:05.32]Yes, it is.
[305:05.80]Is this the game with the flying strawberries?
[305:14.64]It is.
[305:15.44]This is the game with the flying strawberries.
[305:18.44]You got it.
[305:18.94]You nailed it completely.
[305:20.04]I think we just have to go up.
[305:25.05]Hold on a minute here, though.
[305:26.15]Wait a second.
[305:26.79]There's gonna be something on the side.
[305:28.01]I know it.
[305:30.67]You wouldn't shoot that fast through the whole thing.
[305:32.71]Unless there's something to do here.
[305:33.89]You know what I mean?
[305:36.86]Keep an eye out.
[305:41.72]Too late now.
[305:45.58]Well.
[305:47.24]This is gonna be a giant mirror, I'm gonna assume.
[305:52.48]What a huge mirror.
[306:04.61]final boss I think we have at least four or five hours to go no what is that thing
[306:24.28]It's gonna chase me the whole level, isn't it?
[306:26.52]I'm gonna have to fucking Flappy Bird through this whole thing.
[306:28.78]And, oh, it is me.
[306:34.34]What am I supposed to do?
[306:34.90]Okay, I can break.
[306:36.68]I can smash my head into stuff and break stuff.
[306:41.96]Strawberries?
[306:48.88]Does the monster really even give a shit about strawberries?
[306:51.21]I would assume probably not.
[306:54.74]There's no harm in checking.
[306:57.20]What do these do?
[306:58.70]Can't go through them.
[307:06.48]Why did chat slow down so much?
[307:09.34]Um... I think it's starting to get a little later and people may have left.
[307:14.98]Yeah, there was probably people took off.
[307:19.61]People had fun for a little while and then kind of dwindled down a little.
[307:23.74]Just chillin' out.
[307:24.34]Alright, let's go.
[307:33.18]Nothing else?
[307:33.76]I feel like I'm gonna miss secrets and I don't like making... Well, did I just lose?
[307:44.21]Now I'm... Now I am the monster!
[307:57.09]I thought I could maybe get up there.
[308:00.00]The game forces you to go to the... middle.
[308:08.80]Wait.
[308:11.62]That looks breakable.
[308:17.52]Here we go.
[308:17.98]Hey, where are we?
[308:20.22]What did you do to Theo?
[308:21.12]You think I'm doing this?
[308:23.60]That's cute.
[308:24.60]Sweetheart, this is exactly what I warned you about.
[308:28.74]Jump on your head.
[308:29.48]Easy as a... Don't try to make this my fault.
[308:35.29]You still don't get it.
[308:36.87]The mountain gave me this body.
[308:39.37]But I'm not the only creepy thing living in that messed up head of yours.
[308:43.07]Don't like what you see?
[308:44.29]What a surprise.
[308:46.79]Shut up.
[308:49.02]I tried to stop you.
[308:50.18]Look into the mirror.
[308:50.86]All this is yours.
[308:52.74]This temple only magnifies the mountain's power.
[308:55.44]You're in control here, not me.
[308:59.23]dialogue again let's see it I don't believe you if you're part of me why do you want to hurt me poor John always the victim all I do is babysit you and you hate me for it you're unraveling and you know it you care so much about protecting me why didn't you just explain what was going on like you would have listened John you never gave me a chance John
[309:31.65]Please just help me get out of here.
[309:34.45]Now you want me to save you.
[309:37.45]Why are you doing this?
[309:39.25]Just be on my side here, please.
[309:44.02]Stop trying to make me feel like a monster.
[309:45.42]You really want to know why I won't help?
[309:47.54]Because you deserve this.
[309:51.24]Still think you can climb this mountain?
[309:53.95]Shut up.
[309:58.13]I don't need your help.
[309:59.13]I'll do it alone.
[310:03.29]And yes, I was Gamer Fatigue reading that.
[310:05.46]I'm sorry.
[310:06.90]I had some energy earlier, but after the Gamer Fatigue set in... Wait!
[310:19.12]I gotta hit the button.
[310:22.62]Gamer Fatigue!
[310:24.08]You know, when Gamer Fatigue sets in, you just gotta be real careful.
[310:34.02]Nope.
[310:34.78]I have to hold on.
[310:39.20]No, hold on!
[310:41.44]I could actually go around.
[310:43.04]You idiot.
[310:46.83]He's reading Garfield bits.
[311:03.61]Garfield fatigue.
[311:06.29]No, stop jumping, you don't need to.
[311:14.02]Shit.
[311:16.18]Fucking Garfield fatigue.
[311:26.10]Holy shit, I went right into the wall.
[311:32.65]Why am I launching so far?
[311:34.07]Alright, you have to let go.
[311:39.87]It forces you to let go when you grab onto this.
[311:47.06]Ugh.
[311:48.32]Okay, I had to do it, like, a half second earlier.
[311:55.62]Oh, great.
[312:00.12]Don't chase me around.
[312:02.97]You can't do me like this.
[312:06.67]He can crash into these.
[312:07.80]I get it.
[312:08.18]I played the tutorial of this guy's body.
[312:13.58]Oh my god!
[312:14.14]I made it.
[312:14.78]I got a fairy too.
[312:37.72]Out of the way!
[312:38.46]OUT OF THE WAY!
[312:39.06]Come on!
[312:45.18]Hands are greasy.
[312:51.58]That's what I call a save.
[312:54.78]You'll see that in the fucking yearly book of saves.
[312:58.86]How about that one for a save?
[313:37.23]Wow!
[313:45.10]I'll get that one last.
[313:57.64]Whoa!
[314:05.80]Out of the way!
[314:06.22]Get out of my fucking way!
[314:12.14]Is this all in my head?
[314:12.92]Why is it so hostile?
[314:15.00]Those things are hunting me.
[314:16.60]I'm a trespasser in my own world.
[314:18.30]Theo is trapped somewhere in here because of me.
[314:24.69]If I give in fully, maybe the temple will let him go.
[314:26.69]I'll have to do the feather thing.
[314:36.33]Yeah.
[314:37.07]Think of the feather.
[314:39.45]Oh, I don't have to do it.
[314:45.26]Oh, I'm dead.
[314:50.72]I don't even need to get out.
[314:55.69]Well...
[315:09.33]Uh, wait, how do I get out?
[315:10.99]No, there was a thing to do over there.
[315:13.13]Go back down.
[315:17.31]Shit.
[315:19.61]Missed it.
[315:20.23]Damn it.
[315:21.29]That's too bad.
[315:25.37]That's too bad.
[315:38.01]Go right.
[315:38.67]Use the key.
[315:44.73]Another key.
[315:49.58]This is another huge place.
[315:55.28]Alright, he can break that.
[316:17.53]What did that even do for me?
[316:18.72]What's going on?
[316:20.48]What did that do for me?
[316:22.46]What happened?
[316:22.94]Oh, I've released him.
[316:38.51]Fuck.
[316:38.71]Back to drag him through the whole thing?
[316:49.33]No.
[316:50.51]I have to jump on his head.
[316:54.33]He can hit those too, okay.
[316:57.85]Did I strap him?
[316:59.26]I did.
[317:17.71]Oh, I saw it coming from a mile away too.
[317:19.77]There's one key.
[317:21.64]Okay.
[317:22.46]Sure.
[317:47.16]Strawberry up there.
[317:50.68]There's a lot of things to see.
[317:52.34]A lot of ways to go.
[317:56.60]It's going to unlock this one.
[318:01.31]Oh, shit.
[318:02.09]Okay, let's get him to break that door.
[318:05.41]Come here.
[318:08.99]It's over here.
[318:14.87]Is this progression?
[318:15.63]It might be.
[318:18.10]I think this is progression.
[318:19.10]Probably shouldn't do this.
[318:20.44]Another key.
[318:49.40]Where the hell am I going?
[319:05.38]Oh fuck.
[319:12.43]I got no more!
[319:19.60]Oh no!
[319:23.46]This is the worst speedrun I've ever seen.
[319:32.75]I wonder if I can... hmm.
[319:44.71]Let me think about this for a second.
[319:47.47]Maybe I don't have to do that.
[319:50.85]Is it possible that I... Okay, I don't.
[320:01.98]Second key.
[320:06.46]I didn't get that though, unfortunately.
[320:10.86]So this is another lock somewhere that I have to unlock.
[320:14.08]Now where that is, I have no idea.
[320:29.19]I might have to go back up.
[320:33.27]I mean, this... this way.
[320:37.19]Grab on!
[320:43.38]Uh... Um... Get the... Get the... Ah!
[320:49.10]I had to.
[320:54.39]Do AGDQ, but I play every game.
[320:56.99]I feel like a lot of people would probably not want to watch that.
[321:03.34]I got the berry.
[321:06.22]Already went in here.
[321:19.30]Back down.
[321:28.77]I'm gonna get lost again, I just know it.
[321:35.63]I'm certain of it.
[321:38.48]This way?
[321:39.94]Down?
[321:41.34]Up?
[321:43.04]Okay, I found another berry.
[321:45.42]I don't have the right idea.
[322:01.79]I gotta go back.
[322:02.97]Am I skipping this shit?
[322:07.11]Wait a minute.
[322:10.53]That gives me... Ah, my hands!
[322:31.70]Didn't even need to do that.
[322:33.02]OK.
[322:33.14]Ah!
[322:33.58]Got it.
[322:34.00]Secrets?
[322:35.06]No.
[323:01.18]Another button to press.
[323:04.68]Leads us back here.
[323:05.58]He's gonna break this.
[323:08.56]Where is he?
[323:13.38]I get him.
[323:13.88]I get him to break it.
[323:16.12]Does that help me though?
[323:21.38]Oh, there's more.
[323:33.69]Theo, thank God I found you.
[323:35.27]He's in a crystal.
[323:41.27]Happy to see you.
[323:44.09]Are you okay?
[323:46.18]Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
[323:50.80]I've been stuck in this crystal for ages.
[323:52.66]Do you get the feeling that this place knows you better than you know yourself?
[323:57.17]Yeah.
[323:58.65]I'm so embarrassed that you have to see this side of me.
[324:00.65]I tried to stop you.
[324:01.81]I hope that selfie was worth it.
[324:06.16]He did the... He just did it.
[324:07.65]He... You heard it.
[324:08.23]It's the mid... It's the middle one.
[324:26.32]Selfies are always not worth it.
[324:27.64]I shouldn't be mad.
[324:28.34]This isn't your fault.
[324:29.06]I'm glad you're safe, but you're trapped because of me.
[324:32.41]And now this temple is showing you what I'm really like.
[324:37.99]I'm horrible.
[324:40.79]Hey, we're in this together.
[324:41.84]Don't act like this is all on you.
[324:46.48]What do you mean?
[324:46.86]Okay.
[325:06.91]I've got you back.
[325:08.28]I'll bust you out of that thing and then we'll escape together.
[325:11.08]Just as soon as I find my way around to you.
[325:13.56]You're my only hope right now.
[325:16.06]I believe in you for real.
[325:17.88]I hope that's not a mistake.
[325:21.91]You shouldn't have believed in me.
[325:26.27]Oh, fuck.
[325:46.58]You can skip cutscenes?
[325:50.96]Alright, bye!
[325:52.36]I'll get you out of there.
[325:53.18]Eventually.
[325:54.52]Soon.
[325:55.80]Baby.
[325:56.90]It's possible I gotta go up from there.
[326:02.57]More shit that we haven't seen yet.
[326:06.21]Um...
[326:10.11]Got another key.
[326:13.21]There's three keys!
[326:14.18]Does that come back?
[326:19.84]It doesn't, is it?
[326:21.62]Ah, shit!
[326:25.75]I'm kind of mazed out here.
[326:29.11]Um, where was this other door?
[326:36.79]Where's my map?
[326:38.48]I need my map in the top right corner.
[326:41.30]This is where I was.
[326:48.27]I unlocked this, but what the hell was that for?
[326:50.51]What was that for?
[326:55.22]Why did I unlock that?
[327:04.84]Oh shit!
[327:10.67]Am I losing connection?
[327:12.33]It'll be alright, it'll pass.
[327:21.60]Oh, I can use the bubble here.
[327:36.84]No!
[327:37.66]Stay alive!
[327:42.06]What time is it?
[327:47.69]Yeah, sometimes you get a bump.
[327:50.03]We should be fine.
[327:50.57]Okay, I need another key for that door.
[327:55.69]Did I miss anything up here?
[327:57.42]No.
[327:57.72]Oh, jeez.
[328:08.16]Well.
[328:09.42]Yeah, that'll probably happen a couple more times.
[328:13.18]Shit.
[328:15.24]I just gotta move out of the way.
[328:16.90]Don't even touch it.
[328:22.54]Ah.
[328:24.17]That guy's freaking me out.
[328:31.77]I'm losing it again.
[328:45.75]Well, now that's what I'm paying attention to, so.
[328:48.67]In fact, let me just pause it for a second to make sure there's nothing actually going on.
[328:55.30]No.
[328:56.78]It's just being annoying.
[329:16.10]Ah!
[329:16.36]He's right there!
[329:18.18]Oh my god, he's gonna fuck this whole thing up.
[329:27.47]Still has Comcast?
[329:28.47]I do not have Comcast.
[329:29.69]I have a different company.
[329:34.98]But I got some news for everybody here.
[329:39.04]They're all bad.
[329:40.10]All of them.
[329:46.94]The question is, let me see, hold on.
[329:53.31]I think I'm going the right way.
[329:59.67]Although I don't really have any reason to be over here, this is blocked.
[330:14.65]Hit it!
[330:17.39]Come on, there's gotta be something hidden.
[330:19.57]Is there a berry in here or something?
[330:21.53]It's killing me, man.
[330:34.85]It is a thing to jump on.
[330:37.93]Right, the other one.
[330:39.51]It's gonna be the button.
[330:44.29]Fuck.
[330:44.51]God damn it.
[330:45.90]I gotta go around.
[330:58.50]No!
[330:59.52]Did I get it?
[331:00.06]Is it open?
[331:00.78]Is it just open?
[331:01.64]Tell me it's open.
[331:15.13]No, I'm just getting stuck.
[331:17.59]Alright, leave me alone.
[331:30.13]Don't you dare!
[331:35.00]I'm at it!
[331:35.94]Smash it with a hammer!
[331:39.34]Theo, I finally found you.
[331:41.26]I knew you'd make it.
[331:43.18]It wasn't easy, all those monsters really coming from inside me.
[331:49.47]That's a valid question.
[331:50.61]I'll be happy to discuss how the monsters relate to your inner self, but right now my inner self is real sick of being stuck in the crystal.
[331:57.17]Oh, right.
[332:04.09]Didn't work.
[332:07.91]This crystal is like an expression of my negative psychic energy, or whatever.
[332:12.75]Yeah, but how do we break it?
[332:15.66]If I knew why I trapped myself in this thing, maybe I could bust out.
[332:19.38]But I don't.
[332:19.90]And I don't think I can get to the bottom of it while we're stuck in this nightmare dimension.
[332:24.88]You might have to carry me.
[332:29.00]Oh, what?
[332:29.66]No, I would have been like, carry me!
[332:32.00]I don't weigh that much!
[332:32.84]I...
[332:37.64]Leaving you behind.
[332:39.08]Hell no, you better not leave me in this place.
[332:42.74]I was gonna say you might- See?!
[332:43.96]I can do that.
[332:51.11]I told you.
[332:56.07]Dang girl, you're gonna lift.
[332:58.59]Oh, this is gonna be horrible.
[333:04.93]Alright, you got this.
[333:12.13]Now we have to play the puzzle game with this guy's body.
[333:17.03]Hope you know how to deal with these things.
[333:19.40]I do.
[333:21.28]I was gonna use you as a weapon there.
[333:33.93]Let's go!
[333:34.55]Wow, what the fuck was that?
[333:45.33]You did the same thing I did.
[333:49.59]He's in Twitch chat right now.
[333:52.71]Is there no button here?
[333:53.39]Yeah, there is.
[333:56.63]Come here.
[334:05.50]That wasn't... Where was that?
[334:06.50]What was that?
[334:07.10]It wasn't on the head?
[334:09.30]Diarrhea.
[334:09.96]That's what that is.
[334:28.52]Got one there.
[334:32.06]Two.
[334:32.84]Don't touch that.
[334:33.56]I felt it in my bones.
[334:49.57]Are you guys talking?
[334:50.23]Are you guys doing politics in this chat?
[334:52.35]No politics.
[334:53.25]No political discussion.
[334:55.17]End of discussion.
[334:55.95]Don't you understand?
[335:07.12]Unless what you are doing, unless you're doing an impersonation of somebody's voice.
[335:12.14]You can't say anything to do with politics.
[335:29.69]Go, go, go.
[335:32.03]What the hell happened?
[335:35.64]Don't throw them in the spikes.
[335:36.78]Oh, fuck!
[335:39.03]Just get- Throw this idiot over here.
[335:42.05]Throw him the whole way.
[335:42.81]Have him.
[336:01.26]I have to throw him up there.
[336:02.58]Or the- God damn it.
[336:22.51]Oh my god.
[336:30.51]I'm glad they added a fucking Resident Evil 4 companion in this game.
[336:48.41]No!
[336:48.79]No!
[336:49.17]No!
[336:49.49]Just... He has... You have to hit it.
[336:51.07]I have to... I have to hit him.
[336:57.02]I have to throw him into it after jumping on this guy.
[337:10.20]Come on, get over here.
[337:15.96]Out!
[337:17.44]OUT!
[337:18.50]I just screamed so loud.
[337:19.38]That was really loud.
[337:20.28]I'm really sorry.
[337:34.31]Theo saved the day.
[337:37.59]I did, actually.
[337:47.15]Well, that was the right idea, but wrong execution.
[337:50.17]Whatever, he'll be fine.
[338:34.19]I killed him!
[338:35.33]I crushed him!
[338:36.99]Fuck!
[338:39.14]Get away from me!
[338:46.30]Please!
[338:47.38]Help!
[338:47.80]Help!
[338:52.34]Now what?
[338:54.92]Oh, that's not good.
[338:56.62]Yeah, he's gotta be right.
[339:01.22]Help!
[339:01.64]Help!
[339:02.34]Help me!
[339:02.84]Someone, help!
[339:05.38]How am I gonna do this?
[339:19.86]Fuck, I just leave him?
[339:20.60]Oh, I would if I could.
[339:31.76]Okay, I get it.
[339:34.10]It has to be.
[339:39.77]Ready?
[339:42.81]Ah, that's what you gotta do.
[339:43.81]No!
[339:46.71]Stop killing him.
[340:20.98]That was it.
[340:22.42]I had it!
[340:24.68]Got it.
[340:32.22]Game over.
[340:35.83]Come here.
[340:41.20]We have to be close.
[340:42.22]I can feel it.
[340:46.86]Oh, can you now?
[340:48.74]Can you feel it?
[340:55.93]Just stay there for a minute while I figure out what the hell's going on.
[341:11.95]Oh, it's literally right here.
[341:19.24]Uh, hold on.
[341:21.28]No, just go!
[341:21.98]Leave!
[341:22.36]Leave!
[341:24.18]Forget about the fucking berries.
[341:25.20]I can get them later.
[341:26.10]Some other day.
[341:37.93]Playing the electric guitar.
[341:39.00]Someone just looked at the amp up way too loud.
[341:41.64]Throw him into the eye.
[341:42.36]Alright, I got to the center of my brain.
[341:49.80]That's good.
[341:54.99]Chapter complete.
[342:03.74]How many deaths?
[342:04.28]That's gonna be like probably 500 deaths.
[342:06.72]300 deaths?
[342:07.32]400 deaths?
[342:09.32]Not even 200.
[342:09.72]I get a B-side.
[342:18.37]Awesome, okay.
[342:21.19]I think, I think I'm gonna call it here.
[342:23.82]We'll pick it up tomorrow.
[342:26.28]That's probably where we should stop.
[342:28.88]Just about six hours?
[342:34.59]And then just pick it up tomorrow.
[342:37.70]I'm going to actually start on time tomorrow.
[342:46.69]And then we'll just play it tomorrow.
[342:49.77]Starting at the normal time until I finish it.
[342:58.35]Because 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, there was like another two worlds, three worlds, another few hours, and then the bonus content.
[343:07.72]Why did he stream Hit and Run for 12 hours and not this?
[343:12.72]It's called... I was never going to open Hit and Run ever again, and I knew it.
[343:18.97]See, with this, I know that I'll open this again.
[343:23.47]I'm certain I'll play it.
[343:24.79]I'll play through it.
[343:26.23]I can come back to it another day.
[343:27.73]There was not a chance in hell I was going to open hit and run ever again.
[343:32.17]So, I had to beat it.
[343:35.50]So, we'll start regular time tomorrow, somewhere around 3 p.m.
[343:38.88]Pacific.
[343:39.96]Not like 4.30 this time.
[343:43.96]I feel fine.
[343:45.46]I felt like kind of shitty the last day before yesterday and yesterday, but I'll be alright.
[343:53.60]I'll be ready to go.
[343:55.62]First impressions after six hours, I think it's great.
[344:00.32]I think it's got just enough of a challenge factor and a replayability factor.
[344:07.20]Where it's not super rage-inducing, but it's challenging and fun.
[344:11.19]I think it's great.
[344:16.37]But, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[344:17.91]Around 3 p.m.
[344:20.77]Pacific.
[344:26.55]And let's get to the bits.
[344:30.49]Which is... Okay, the game saves itself, right?
[344:33.11]Let me just make sure.
[344:34.73]Like, my game... We're good, right?
[344:36.87]Climb.
[344:38.25]Yeah, okay.
[344:39.41]Now there's the total deaths.
[344:42.52]893 total deaths so far.
[344:45.26]Still missing a few hearts.
[344:46.72]Still missing a couple of bonus tapes.
[344:53.16]Wow, how much did you guys have?
[344:58.17]That's very off from 922.
[344:59.41]Where are you guys getting the other 30 deaths from?
[345:09.62]922.
[345:09.64]I literally accumulated each individual level.
[345:23.51]Oh, the little computer one.
[345:24.61]Right.
[345:25.01]That would make sense.
[345:27.82]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[345:28.79]Let's see the bits.
[345:30.13]Take care.
[345:31.61]Those of you that came over from Joel's channel, I hope you stuck around.
[345:35.63]Thanks for sticking around.
[345:37.21]I'm Jerma.
[345:37.65]Nice to see you.
[345:40.93]And let's get to the bits.
[345:43.13]And pick it up tomorrow.
[345:50.00]The outro screen.
[345:54.99]Gotta go back about six hours ago here.
[345:57.70]We had a lot of community subs, so there's a lot to scroll.
[346:01.56]A shitload, actually, of community subs.
[346:06.66]Back here we had Ivory for $1.
[346:08.28]Hey Jerma, sad to say that I won't be able to join many livestreams from now on due to looking for work and doing small jobs.
[346:15.64]But I sincerely appreciate watching your streams while working into the night.
[346:18.48]Please do not slap yourself, my fellow scaly friend.
[346:23.48]Well, congratulations on getting some small jobs.
[346:29.93]And I hope you find something.
[346:30.77]I hope you find some work.
[346:37.05]It can be a tough environment.
[346:39.33]I wish you the best.
[346:39.95]I hate to break it to you, but I'm not a scaler.
[346:45.03]I don't even know what that word means.
[346:47.36]But thank you, Ivory.
[346:48.64]Don't worry about making it to every stream.
[346:53.58]Appreciate it.
[346:54.94]Appreciate you nonetheless.
[346:56.84]Double D, thanks for the $1.
[346:57.82]Alright, so welcome everyone to the 68th meeting of the Biaz.
[347:00.78]As you know, we do this meeting every single month to make sure that we agree on things.
[347:04.78]So let's get started.
[347:06.83]Okay, opening a can of beef.
[347:13.57]Opening a can of beef.
[347:14.47]18 wheelies.
[347:16.57]Wheelies.
[347:19.96]Going the respected speed limit in a school zone.
[347:23.72]Meeting of the Baz has commenced.
[347:25.56]I'll see you all next month.
[347:26.46]There we go.
[347:35.07]Thank you, Jess, for the $1.
[347:36.09]Thanks for showing me what Picross is.
[347:37.61]I've lost so much time already.
[347:38.99]Countless hours.
[347:40.31]Sleepless nights.
[347:41.09]I can't stop.
[347:42.03]I'm ruined.
[347:45.41]Picross is...
[347:47.50]Some of the most fun ever.
[347:48.64]And, uh, what do you mean ruined?
[347:49.94]You're training your brain.
[347:51.50]You're doing puzzles.
[347:52.38]You're doing... You're getting knowledge.
[347:55.34]Mathematics.
[348:01.01]There are plenty of good ones.
[348:03.23]Siroc, thanks for the dollar for rats.
[348:04.95]Rats?
[348:05.25]He lives with rats, eating out of the garbage and trash.
[348:08.19]Jerma, he lives in the sewers now.
[348:09.53]Watch out for floods until the coast is clear.
[348:13.02]Who does?
[348:13.86]Me?
[348:16.55]FGW, thanks for the $1.
[348:17.93]The jermaOld emote looks like Larry David or George Costanza.
[348:20.93]It's a 10 out of 10 emote.
[348:23.93]Well, it should look like me because it's my face.
[348:33.42]Thank you Divis for the $3.
[348:37.12]$3 every stream from Divis.
[348:38.38]Thank you.
[348:40.35]Really appreciate it.
[348:41.37]Just consistently every single time.
[348:44.91]Thank you.
[348:46.53]Bake Me Home, thanks for the one dollar.
[348:49.98]Golden Foxy, thanks for the one dollar.
[348:52.62]I just want to say, did you know that you can make your own SEGA 1000, SEGA Genesis, SEGA Saturn?
[348:59.38]Meaning you are the chap who can make your own games.
[349:03.88]For example, Mr. Sneak Man, Jex Ultimate, The Rats Invasion.
[349:08.09]Hope you get better.
[349:09.71]SEGA 1000.
[349:10.35]You can make your own SEGA games?
[349:17.33]Oh, I don't really know how to code.
[349:19.13]So, that's interesting that it's available.
[349:22.11]Aren't there still people making NES games?
[349:26.69]And they actually make the cartridge and stuff?
[349:28.24]I swear to God, this is... Am I making this up?
[349:38.86]Hold on, 10 minutes?!
[349:40.02]10 minutes slow-mode!
[349:43.16]Oh, no no no, that's... you have to be here for 10 minutes.
[349:47.06]Okay, I see.
[349:48.12]For a second I thought it was just 10 minutes slow-mode, I was like, what the fuck is happening?
[349:54.54]That's interesting stuff, though.
[349:55.92]I've seen NES kind of games made before on their own cartridges, which is interesting.
[350:02.81]Thank you Smelly Boy for the $1 power steering on my van.
[350:05.71]Gave out at college today so I had to drive all the way home hoping not to die.
[350:10.52]Find... Found out I'm not just out of fluid but there's a massive leak.
[350:15.80]Have to borrow a friend's car.
[350:17.24]Praying the repair isn't over $1,000.
[350:20.26]Then I open up the stream and my name is Jeremy.
[350:22.44]I... Get me with the story and then you try to pull me in with a little fucked up comment.
[350:34.66]Sorry to hear about your car.
[350:36.98]Hopefully it fixes itself.
[350:39.26]What?
[350:39.90]No, hopefully it gets repaired.
[350:40.94]Hey, SticksRenegade, thanks for the $1 stream idea.
[350:44.91]Get this book called Wreck This Journal.
[350:47.67]Almost each page has a suggestion of how to damage the book.
[350:56.51]That's, uh, why?
[351:01.28]Thank you Tibby Tim Tam for the one dollar.
[351:02.86]You and your new toy sound like my brother when he bought a nine pack of kazoos off Amazon.
[351:10.72]What's his name?
[351:11.66]What's the toy's name?
[351:14.08]Shito, right?
[351:16.54]Alright, is your name Shito?
[351:23.77]That's yes.
[351:25.57]What's your name?
[351:25.93]Is your name Shito?
[351:33.24]He said, what's your name?
[351:35.90]Shito.
[351:38.12]Shito.
[351:39.56]Yes, okay, I feel you.
[351:40.80]And it looks like Pac-Man, so I love it.
[351:50.87]Thank you to eWordTwerk, eWordTwerk, thanks for the $3.75.
[351:55.41]Jerma, are there any plans for a best of 2018 video?
[351:59.13]Well, we did a end of the year 2018 stream.
[352:02.61]Some of the best of was in that stream.
[352:06.85]And if you mean game-wise, I have no plans on doing it.
[352:13.64]I think we went over them already.
[352:21.18]But number one... I don't know.
[352:25.68]I don't remember.
[352:27.74]We did do it.
[352:29.28]Do an entire stream narrated by Shito.
[352:34.84]Shito will make more than one appearance, don't worry.
[352:39.83]But no plans for like a video or anything.
[352:42.57]Did a couple of streams based around the last year.
[352:47.08]That's probably where I'm going to leave it.
[352:48.86]But thank you.
[352:49.42]Thank you, Benny Jets, for the $5.
[352:50.56]I'm playing through Hotline Miami 2 and Jerma made it look five times harder than it actually is.
[352:57.65]That's not true.
[352:58.61]That game is incredibly difficult.
[352:59.83]That's one of the hardest games I've ever played.
[353:05.39]So, I mean, if you want to put yourself in like the 0.0001%, that's fine.
[353:11.96]That game is fucking insanely difficult.
[353:17.11]And that's great!
[353:17.99]I'm really happy that you're in the 0.0000002% of all people on Earth.
[353:20.82]0.4%, actually.
[353:21.18]I am?
[353:21.42]Yeah!
[353:45.23]We already went over during that stream, like, the Steam achievement for the second level being completed.
[353:50.92]Alright?
[353:51.24]You can't deny the facts.
[353:54.52]They're there, and they're right in front of you.
[354:01.37]Somebody mentioned Hotline Bam, and he's already salty.
[354:03.65]No, I'm fine.
[354:04.35]I'm doing just fine.
[354:13.68]But thank you, Benny Jets.
[354:14.52]Congratulations on being in the 0.004% of all video game players.
[354:20.09]I'm very happy that you're there.
[354:26.35]I'm not.
[354:28.15]That's just the way it is.
[354:36.79]We had a ton of anonymous gifted subs earlier, like 20.
[354:40.92]Whoever you were, thank you.
[354:42.12]A ton from Furt Fernandez.
[354:46.72]I could see why.
[354:47.60]It's... I don't really... I currently don't have any real complaints about the game.
[354:50.90]Well, I have one, but it's not a complaint.
[354:56.32]It's a preference.
[355:07.97]And that is... No, you know, I'm gonna hold off.
[355:12.37]When I finish Celeste, we'll talk about it.
[355:15.18]But currently, I don't have any actual complaints about the game.
[355:17.46]I think it's fantastic.
[355:26.51]It's just a couple of preference things.
[355:30.79]And none of them really have anything to do with the game, like the gameplay.
[355:37.47]But thank you, Dr. Fudge.
[355:39.09]Thank you, Kerplunkers, for the $10.
[355:40.51]No message.
[355:41.35]Thank you, Kerplunkers.
[355:47.36]No message, but thank you.
[355:49.58]Thank you, DoorCube700000Games, for the $1.
[355:52.68]This entire game is sour, please.

[355:59.44]Thank you, Creel, for the $5.
[356:00.36]Whoever said press B to fuck...
[356:07.47]when we uh okay I'm gonna skip this one uh thank you for the five dollars superintendent chalmers thanks for the one dollar hey Jerma really enjoying your videos
[356:21.14]Your last video about the Spy-cicle really helped me improve as a Spy main.
[356:24.78]You should do another Tips and Tricks video on the Huntsman, though.
[356:27.73]The first one wasn't very clear.
[356:29.53]Also, really enjoying the Grandpa videos, but the JermaCraft series is very lackluster.
[356:33.85]I suggest you combine the two and call it Grandpa Invades JermaCraft.
[356:37.91]Would make it a bit more bearable.
[356:39.29]Best of love and congrats on 8,.000.
[356:40.51]8.000 subs.
[356:51.60]Thank you for the one doll.
[356:52.52]Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the one doll.
[356:54.03]The amount of times you just screamed idiot at yourself when you died earlier is only reaffirming my belief that you are actually Dennis from Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[357:12.75]Somebody wrote, who?
[357:16.11]I don't know what that is.
[357:16.85]I've never seen that show.
[357:23.26]except I on stream I think three or four times talked about how it was like one of the better comedies that was on TV I already told you guys my top like five favorite shows is kirby enthusiasm always sunny Philadelphia kirby enthusiasm again deserves to be on there twice game of thrones seasons one through four or season maybe maybe five if I if I really gave a
[357:52.72]And then... I don't know.
[357:57.54]That's it.
[358:00.23]And then One Punch Man.
[358:04.69]He's laughing so fucking hard.
[358:10.03]No, this is a great show.
[358:10.73]It probably would be on there.
[358:27.98]the books are better thank you to one black sperm for the $1 hi Jerma are you gonna play Resident Evil 2 when it comes out yes I am absolutely
[358:56.00]Play the demo?
[358:56.68]No, I'm not gonna... No, I... No demo.
[359:00.03]The demo just... The problem with the demo is... You do it, and then you're already into the game and you want to keep playing it, and you just can't.
[359:11.08]So then you have to wait for the actual game to come out.
[359:16.59]I'm not gonna Vermintide 2 myself again.
[359:18.59]Not gonna happen.
[359:20.15]You know the story with Vermintide 2.
[359:21.99]I played the demo for six hours straight and played the same three levels and then didn't want to play the actual release when it came out.
[359:28.92]I ain't gonna Vermintide 2 myself again.
[359:35.93]But thank you, thank you to... For the two dollars, by the way.
[359:40.07]No, I just look like a psycho in every photo.
[359:41.23]Doesn't matter.
[359:41.55]I have a gift of looking awful in almost every picture I've ever taken.
[359:44.45]Also, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself about selfies.
[359:47.27]They're the modern self-portrait.
[360:11.35]Yeah, I was just messing around.
[360:13.07]I was just kidding around.
[360:16.41]Thank you for all the community subs to CookieCRM.
[360:20.07]Thank you dead-o.
[360:21.75]Thank you dead-dead-o.
[360:23.99]Dead-o, dead-o.
[360:24.77]I know I say your name correct.

[360:27.96]But thank you for the community subs.
[360:30.94]Mostly lost.
[360:31.54]Thanks for the $1.
[360:32.38]This picture is very important.
[360:38.13]When do you guys think the gnome thing is going to transition over to something else?
[360:41.78]Because right now, we're like in the gnome.
[360:45.08]We're in the gnome zone.
[360:47.62]How long does it take for a new thing to replace the old thing?
[360:55.90]Five years?
[361:07.04]But thank you to Trust Hari for the $1.
[361:11.29]Jerma, I'm not kidding.
[361:12.11]Please help.
[361:12.61]They're right.
[361:15.93]Sorry.
[361:17.43]Matthew Martin, thanks for the $1.
[361:18.79]Hey, Jeremy.
[361:19.91]Hey, Jerma.
[361:21.12]Oh, sorry.
[361:21.64]I don't know why I do that sometimes.
[361:25.38]Thank you for the $1.
[361:26.92]Matthew.
[361:27.42]Hey, Jerma, it's me, GoldenFoxy.
[361:30.02]I've been banned on my other account.
[361:32.79]You've just been banned.
[361:36.69]Well, I... How do you keep getting banned?
[361:45.00]Anyways.
[361:46.60]Uh... I want to let you know that you make me happy I have depression and I want you to know you're the best livestreamer and YouTuber I've ever watched.
[361:54.05]Uh... I want to talk about school and my bullies to you since I do that with all my friends.
[361:59.43]I can't because this account is on the risk of being banned too.
[362:01.83]I also want to let the mods know I'm sorry.
[362:06.72]Um Alright, well first of all Uh, and then you say I'm gonna miss you because you're getting banned Well, let's go over a couple things here if you if you get banned More than a couple times
[362:29.42]you kind of need to take a look and see what's happening there.
[362:34.95]And maybe you're saying something or doing something that you might need to think about potentially changing.
[362:44.15]So maybe just take a look and see maybe the things you're saying.
[362:50.18]Take a step back and breathe a little bit and see.
[362:54.04]Second of all, hope you have a great day too.
[362:58.85]You want to let the mods know that you're sorry?
[363:11.46]If you get banned and create a new account, why even mention the other account?
[363:18.08]I'm not sure.
[363:21.96]Everybody is welcome to hang out here and have fun.
[363:25.81]But there are certain things that you kind of have to... You gotta play by some rules.
[363:34.08]And if the line is crossed a couple times and you're, you know, warned or told or... There's warning systems and there's... It's not just... If you said something, you're gone forever.
[363:46.17]Right?
[363:47.91]All the mods here are very, very happy to hear out a grievance and try to work it out.
[363:55.66]But maybe if you're getting banned a bunch of times, maybe step back and try to figure out maybe what the things you're saying.
[364:00.75]Or what you're doing, you know?
[364:07.91]But... Thanks for sticking around.
[364:11.35]Hopefully you don't get banned again.
[364:13.91]I really hope that doesn't happen.
[364:17.55]But thank you for the donations you've given.
[364:19.59]Thank you so much.
[364:28.42]God.
[364:29.66]Thank you, Mandum Requiem, for the two dollars.
[364:32.62]No message, thank you.
[364:33.74]For the two bucks.
[364:35.68]Djack, thanks for one dollar.
[364:36.95]Very refreshing to watch you be good at video games after rewatching The Simpsons Hit and Run VOD today.
[364:47.99]That game is fucking hell.
[364:52.86]Look, if you put your hand on a stove, okay, if we're standing there together, you and me, we're both standing in my kitchen, and the stove is on, and there's a pan on the stove,
[365:06.85]And I tell you, hey, this pan is burning hot.
[365:10.45]I'm gonna burn my hand if I touch that.
[365:12.57]And you say, no, you're not.
[365:13.51]You're not gonna burn your hand.
[365:14.67]That pan's not even hot.
[365:15.97]And I'm like, dude, the pan is burning fucking hot right now.
[365:19.37]If I touch it, I'm gonna burn myself.
[365:21.05]And you're like, no, you're wrong.
[365:21.91]You're not gonna get burnt.
[365:23.23]And I put my hand in there and I burn my fucking hand, okay?
[365:27.69]Fuck, oh my God, it's all red and shit.
[365:31.05]And then you stare at me and you go, dude, you stick your fucking hand in there
[365:39.52]And you're staring in my eyes.
[365:41.62]And your fucking hand is melting.
[365:43.84]And you're like, dude, it's not even that hot.
[365:47.32]Yes, it is.
[365:48.34]Just because we have a different tolerance for pain doesn't mean the pan isn't hot.
[365:53.43]Look at your hand.
[366:00.33]Literally, your hand is melting off your fucking wrist.
[366:05.55]The pan is hot.
[366:07.92]I don't want to get my hand burnt.
[366:10.22]You can hold your hand in there all you want.
[366:11.50]That doesn't mean the pan ain't hot.
[366:22.09]What does this have to do with anything?
[366:23.59]He said, it's refreshing to watch you be good at a video game after rewatching The Simpsons Hit and Run.
[366:28.73]The Simpsons Hit and Run is the hot pan.
[366:31.76]Wow, you're really sucking, Simpsons Hit and Run.
[366:34.02]You know, I beat Simpsons Hit and Run first try.
[366:36.90]You keep your hand in that pan all you want, it's still hot.
[366:48.31]You get triggered so easily.
[366:51.99]Well... Stop triggering me!
[366:58.89]I was gonna try to put this, I was gonna try to scream with this.
[367:05.38]But I didn't end up doing it.
[367:10.06]Don't say that.
[367:14.08]What?
[367:15.76]People saying I'm getting triggered?
[367:16.96]Alright, Shido's time to read the bits.
[367:23.70]Thank you Djack for the one dollar.
[367:26.90]Shitload of community subs on Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[367:28.90]Thank you.
[367:31.34]Ditto.
[367:32.44]So many community subs.
[367:33.94]It's unbelievable.
[367:38.44]Unbelievable.
[367:38.88]You guys are seriously... You guys are too much.
[367:42.85]Thank you.
[367:43.61]PeacefulHaley, thanks for the $1.
[367:44.75]I hate when I donate and I don't exactly know what to say.
[367:47.67]But anyways, hope all is well with you.
[367:48.99]Thanks for being my inspiration.
[367:50.97]Have a good night, Jerma, and chat.
[367:52.27]You as well.
[367:52.73]Thank you, PeacefulHaley.
[367:59.02]I make triggered jokes in 2019.
[368:01.44]No, that was me responding to somebody that said that to me in chat.
[368:05.86]So I responded with the reference back at them because that's what they understand.
[368:11.15]Right?
[368:14.21]That person, that's what that person understood when I said that back.
[368:31.13]Master of Comedy wouldn't stoop that low.
[368:33.03]As I said, don't trigger me screaming it as a joke, responding to the guy that said the word triggered in the first place.
[368:39.87]I was doing a back and forth with that guy because that's what they understood.
[368:44.16]You understand?
[368:47.70]Thanks for the $1, Matthew.
[368:49.80]Now let's have Shido do one.
[368:55.97]Thank you to PleaseGoOutWithMyGrandpa for $5.04 and they say,
[369:07.52]Thank you.
[369:12.48]Not peeing in your closet bathroom combo like a god tier streamer.
[369:15.50]No.
[369:27.41]Well, thank you.
[369:27.83]Please go out with my grandpa for the $5.
[369:29.11]Ditto.
[369:29.79]Thanks for $15.
[369:30.75]Please get PCmatic.
[369:32.13]That's right.
[369:39.49]I'm a PC-matic.
[369:42.21]It's like a total scam, right?
[369:48.75]Lower the pitch on the peeper machine?
[369:54.69]But thank you, Dedo, for the huge amount of money and the huge amount of community subs.
[369:57.81]Thank you so much.
[370:00.76]C4G, thanks for the $1.
[370:01.92]Please give us the first clue in the Jerma ARG.
[370:05.02]I'll have Shido do that.
[370:29.88]Did you get all that?
[370:31.30]You have to open up... First of all, you have to open up Portal 2.
[370:34.48]And then there's a wall you need to look at.
[370:35.74]And I'm not even going to give you the hints.
[370:36.76]Why would I do that?
[370:39.64]Hey, Breambin, thanks for the five dollars.
[370:41.46]Showing off your true gamer skills.
[370:43.12]Thank you.
[370:45.97]Thanks a lot.
[370:48.15]Thanks for the five dollars and thanks for the message.
[370:52.89]Thank you, Matthew, for the one dollar.
[370:54.05]The whole level is you jumping on laundry.
[370:55.60]That's kind of cool.
[370:56.98]But then he does the sideways kind of, eh, I don't know about that face.
[371:09.88]Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[371:11.20]That computer minigame you played is actually an extended version of the game's demo.
[371:15.74]That's really cool.
[371:19.02]Cool that they would hide that somewhere in the game.
[371:20.44]That's fun.
[371:22.59]Unamused Panda, thanks for the $1.
[371:24.09]It's just fun, Jerma.
[371:25.01]Just smooth, ass-clenching fun.
[371:28.95]Yeah, it is.
[371:33.91]Spattens... Spatten SFM, thanks for the $8.15.
[371:40.20]Hey, Jerm, I've been watching for years and just wanted to say that I appreciate everything that you do.
[371:43.90]I love putting you in the background as I draw.
[371:46.31]You're somehow the most relaxing and hysterical streamer on Twitch, and I hope to enjoy and support your content for years to come.
[371:53.05]Take care.
[371:55.34]Thank you for the $8.15.
[371:58.14]Spatting.
[372:00.86]I will have to tell you, relaxing.
[372:03.58]Relaxing.
[372:04.94]I think I screamed a dozen times tonight.
[372:08.08]You're like sitting there drawing, I imagine.
[372:09.48]You're just like, you hear a loud scream and your hand moves because I startled you and you fuck up the drawing.
[372:15.27]Hopefully that's not happening.
[372:16.17]Yeah, I'm going to finish it tomorrow.
[372:19.83]We'll finish Celeste tomorrow.
[372:28.76]I mean, usually.
[372:32.71]You're still pretty calm even when you yell compared to some.
[372:35.41]I still like to scream.
[372:36.65]Because I know how grating and annoying that can be sometimes for people.
[372:43.32]The loud sound.
[372:44.62]You just have to pull your headphones out like, Jesus.
[372:48.70]I try not to do it that often.
[372:53.40]But, thanks a lot.
[372:56.34]I'm happy to be the thing that you can relax to for sure thank you crusty earwax thanks for the two bucks oh my gosh Jerma I thanks for the two dollars uncommon thanks for the four dollars pj salt pj salt pj salt I think that was when I was talking about the diagonal Xbox controller
[373:18.59]SuperSeal, thanks for the $1.
[373:19.93]After playing this game for a stream or two, you should replay Meat Boy and see how you match, how much your new climbing reflex fucks you up.
[373:30.20]I love this game so much.
[373:34.68]Thank you, Drosophilia, for the $1.
[373:36.41]All you have to do to get the PS4 controller to work flawlessly on Steam is to plug it into your computer, then in Steam, go to Settings, Controller, General Settings, enable PlayStation Configuration Support, then use Steam Big Picture Mod mode.
[373:49.67]I've actually... I used to use the PS4 controller, and I don't know what game it was, but there was a couple of games in a row that even having the Big Picture mode and PlayStation Configuration just didn't work.
[374:04.73]It didn't matter what I did.
[374:05.51]I just wouldn't accept it for some reason.
[374:09.49]I don't know which one it was.
[374:18.44]But, thank you for the tips.
[374:25.60]Done playing, thanks for the $1.
[374:28.52]Well, $5 actually.
[374:30.16]I am done playing for tonight.
[374:31.70]I'll pick it up tomorrow.
[374:34.38]Pugatron, thanks for the $30.
[374:36.10]We got you earlier.
[374:37.98]But thank you so much for the $30.
[374:46.89]Much love to you.
[374:47.43]Thank you.
[374:49.93]Uh... Trine Onifi, thanks for the $1.
[374:53.03]Gabe and Andrew are big noobs.
[374:58.46]Um... Oh, there's a frenzy right there?
[375:01.88]A future gamer, thanks for the two bucks.
[375:03.40]Since chat was talking about Scare Saturdays, could we watch this?
[375:06.84]I'm surprised that you kept this on the channel.
[375:08.73]No.
[375:09.21]Is this the demon lord fucking video again?
[375:12.11]If this is the demon video, I swear to God.
[375:19.25]No, it's eerie.
[375:20.76]Scariest game I've ever played.
[375:23.54]Why does this have 266,000 views?
[375:24.26]Why didn't this just get buried...
[375:28.65]So many of these old, old videos had like 30,000 views.
[375:31.88]Why does this have 300,000?
[375:33.42]And it was uploaded fucking almost five years ago.
[375:38.03]This is such a bad video.
[375:41.69]Is it?
[375:41.89]I haven't seen it.
[375:44.80]Show it on stream?
[375:45.50]No, I'm not going to.
[375:46.92]I don't feel like getting embarrassed.
[375:47.88]I'm not going to get third-hand embarrassment.
[375:49.60]Yes, that's right.
[375:50.14]That was me embarrassed when I first made it.
[375:52.47]Embarrassed at the comments people wrote.
[375:54.27]Now embarrassed going back and watching the embarrassment that I felt with everybody else here getting embarrassed.
[376:00.68]That's third or fourth-hand embarrassment there.
[376:15.13]I'm just kidding.
[376:15.87]It's probably fine.
[376:17.38]But it is 12 minutes.
[376:20.16]And I don't really want to watch a 12 minute video right now.
[376:25.26]Put it on the list.
[376:26.38]We've got to watch 700,000 games too.
[376:28.37]I swear to God, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to watch 700,000 games and then we're going to do whatever.
[376:34.61]Right?
[376:34.79]Remember that one?
[376:38.66]But thank you, Future Gamer.
[376:39.52]I appreciate it.
[376:41.65]Todd Floride, thanks for the... Todd Flowered, thanks for the $1.
[376:45.90]Let my... Hold on, this just went down.
[376:52.02]Oh, somebody just gave another dollar.
[376:53.10]Oh, it was a dollar?
[376:54.50]How much was that?
[376:57.60]Yeah.
[376:59.97]Oh, Rip came too late.
[377:03.67]Rip hopes in Dreamcasts.
[377:05.37]No, it's in the closet behind me.
[377:07.29]It has to be done eventually.
[377:08.93]It can't just not happen.
[377:11.94]You understand?
[377:17.40]It's going to sit there and taunt me.
[377:19.91]I already own it.
[377:23.23]Tomorrow?
[377:23.63]No, we're going to finish Celeste tomorrow.
[377:24.93]And then we'll see the Dreamcast probably next week.
[377:28.61]The Dreamcast got lost in the mail.
[377:32.89]Thank you, Everscalf for the $1.
[377:35.53]Double D for the $1.
[377:36.25]There's an image here.
[377:37.34]Let's take a look.
[377:43.20]Alright, that's pretty good.
[377:49.71]You said Dreamcast today.
[377:51.25]I know, I did.
[377:52.55]I know, but then I saw Celeste.
[377:54.63]And I kind of had to play it.
[377:57.53]Uh, thank you... Caillou Anderson.
[378:02.25]Thank you, Caillou Anderson, for the $1.
[378:03.73]Double D, thanks for the $1.
[378:06.25]Also, please watch this.
[378:07.31]I saw it on the subreddit.
[378:13.33]Oh, my fucking god.
[378:14.09]Alright, I will watch this one.
[378:18.31]We'll watch this one, just because... I don't... Have I seen this?
[378:21.93]I don't know.
[378:27.13]Let me just exit out of Celeste.
[378:31.13]Preparing to launch Celeste.
[378:32.59]What?
[378:35.49]Okay.
[378:38.40]Let's get it on the screen.
[379:04.49]You already did this one.
[379:07.45]What the fuck is this?
[379:42.06]Is that it?
[379:43.46]No, that wasn't it.
[379:44.36]I fucking accidentally clicked out of the window.
[379:46.24]Don't fuck about me.
[380:00.41]That was funny.
[380:01.95]Good work.
[380:02.95]Excellent work.
[380:05.51]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[380:07.57]It's another YouTube link.
[380:09.93]Let's check it first.
[380:11.13]Make sure it's not a gnome.
[380:16.98]It's one of my videos from a long time ago.
[380:20.74]Come on now, come on, use those legs.
[380:52.70]Why?
[380:52.94]Why?
[380:53.12]Because I've been around for a long time, okay?
[381:02.49]Look, let me explain.
[381:16.66]I've made a thousand videos, okay?
[381:19.63]I've made, oh, a thousand videos.
[381:21.77]I've streamed, like, three thousand times.
[381:25.61]Sometimes, shit like this flies on the radar, and it just happens.
[381:31.76]I got a thousand videos.
[381:46.82]Where did they even come from?
[381:49.30]Is it because of the fart shit?
[381:52.08]And I kept on talking about how not cool it was and how bad content it was.
[381:57.03]You are so quick.
[381:57.81]How do you even remember that?
[381:59.15]I don't remember even doing that.
[382:00.45]Do you understand?
[382:01.97]I don't remember that video.
[382:04.45]I don't remember that portion.
[382:05.58]How did you find that?
[382:16.14]Unbelievable.
[382:19.20]And then Demonic Cucumber says, someone in chat really wanted you to see that.
[382:39.09]Oh, I love it.
[382:41.84]That's... That's fucking great.
[382:43.76]Thank you for that.
[382:45.69]Caillou Anderson, thanks for the $1.
[382:48.39]Frodian Weapon, thanks for $2.
[382:50.21]Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $1.
[382:51.55]Play the spill clip at the lowest speed setting.
[382:53.99]The pain you show is real.
[382:59.89]At the lowest speed setting.
[383:01.09]Hold on.
[383:09.50]Oh, the pain I show is real.
[383:10.84]All I... I... I'm just me.
[383:13.26]I'm just who I am.
[383:14.95]That's it.
[383:28.95]Stop, you're hurting him.
[383:30.13]What?
[383:31.53]No!
[383:34.17]It's water.
[383:34.79]Fucking goddammit.
[383:35.65]I don't...
[383:45.89]What did you say?
[383:46.47]At times .5 speed?
[383:54.31]I love this thing.
[384:05.04]Stop, you're hurting him.
[384:07.32]What?
[384:19.84]That shit looks like a different person.
[384:22.87]But that doesn't look like me.
[384:26.97]My eyes are coming out of my head.
[384:28.41]What?
[384:34.09]Jesus.
[384:34.51]Alright.
[384:35.11]Well, thank you.
[384:36.17]Thank you, Swickety Swanky, for the $1 and the clip.
[384:42.08]Gil, thanks for the community subs.
[384:43.70]You came in with a shitload.
[384:44.90]Thank you so much.
[384:47.58]Why is your chin so thin and go so far down?
[384:49.98]I don't know.
[384:51.56]I have a fucked up face.
[384:53.94]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[384:55.34]Hey, Jeremy, I'm back again with my weekly bits and such.
[384:57.34]I'm staying with family till the home situation can be sorted out, so life's okay.
[385:02.36]I have a lot of disposable cash and want to spend it on a passion of mine, custom Lego figures.
[385:09.25]But God, are they expensive.
[385:11.33]I was wondering where you stand on how much you should spend on your hobbies if you have the money.
[385:16.30]Anybody love the stream?
[385:17.48]Keep it up.
[385:19.36]I would say... Let me turn... Let's put Shido to bed for a second here.
[385:28.06]As long as you're taking care of stuff that needs to be taken care of in your life.
[385:33.63]So if you have rent, if you have bills and you're taking care of them and you're paying them, right?
[385:38.68]Once you have that extra income that you know that you can spend, then go for it.
[385:45.84]There's no, I don't think there's a reason to
[385:49.34]Well, and savings as well.
[385:50.68]Make sure you're saving some money too, whether you have other accounts or if you have an investment portfolio, if you have one of those.
[385:58.76]But once all your necessities are taken care of and you have something else left over, then why not?
[386:11.63]But just make sure you cover all your bases first.
[386:17.87]Don't forget about savings.
[386:19.29]It's very important.
[386:26.17]Buy gold.
[386:29.19]Hey, if you have disposable income and you have some money and you maybe want to try some investment opportunities, you want to try something else, buy a little bit of gold.
[386:37.27]Do it.
[386:38.49]That's for you to decide.
[386:40.25]That's for you to do what you please.
[386:46.97]Not a bubble, by the way.
[386:48.31]Bald coin.
[386:50.17]By the way, I am not a financial advisor.
[386:51.89]I just play one on TV.
[386:56.15]Just to let you know.
[386:57.59]But, I wish you luck.
[386:58.59]Custom LEGO figures sounds cool.
[387:01.39]If you're into it, and you got the money, and you've taken care of yourself, go for it.
[387:05.60]Make sure you take care of yourself first, though.
[387:06.92]It's very important.
[387:07.74]Dorkcube!
[387:08.74]700,000 games.
[387:09.28]Thanks for the $1.
[387:09.94]All the berries you missed inspired me to make this.
[387:13.92]Jerma's blind.
[387:21.17]What the fuck, I spent all my money on gold?
[387:24.31]Well, at least you'll be able to dig down into the dirt faster.
[387:26.67]That was a little Minecraft gag for you.
[387:33.60]Hey, Garfield and Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[387:35.44]Garf is about to eat his Tuesday dinner, Jerma, so as our guest of honor in the Arbuckle household, why don't you come over here and cut the roast beef?
[387:44.07]I've actually never had roast beef before.
[387:45.47]Is it good?
[387:45.97]Mm, I'm not a fan.
[387:48.21]I mean, I'm a fan, but not a big fan.
[387:49.65]Oh, look, Odie's about to give a toast to Jerma.
[387:51.49]Bark, bark, he says.
[387:52.49]I knew Odie wouldn't stop himself from crying.
[387:54.92]He gets emotional at these types of events.
[387:57.06]Anyway, Jerm, what's that you got on your plate?
[387:59.68]Wow, you didn't think you were into that sort of thing.
[388:01.48]Alright, chat, let's dig in.
[388:03.66]What, roast beef?
[388:04.40]What are you talking about?
[388:08.53]Dork Cube, 700,000 games, thanks to the $1.
[388:10.25]Have you ever thought about ending the stream before 3 a.m.
[388:13.29]so I can hear you read my bits before bedtime?
[388:17.39]I've thought about it before.
[388:22.22]But remember, it's not 3 a.m.
[388:23.18]for me.
[388:23.46]It is 10.47 p.m.
[388:23.72]Pacific time.
[388:28.83]But that's why.
[388:29.37]I know I'm on Pacific.
[388:32.24]So when we go, you know, about five, six hours into a stream, and we're at that place where I know it's early for me, but it's not for everybody else, maybe dial it back a little and do it again tomorrow.
[388:48.69]That's totally fine.
[388:50.05]I want to make sure that you don't stand up too late.
[388:53.69]Looking out for you.
[388:56.29]Hey boy, 314, thanks for the six dollars.
[389:00.58]Have my ad bits, junks.
[389:03.60]I'm getting my wisdom tooth out tomorrow morning, but your shitty stream with no webcam really keeps me relaxed.
[389:08.82]I don't do webcam.
[389:10.22]I don't do web- look, I don't do webcam.
[389:15.38]There's a guy in the corner of your screen, sitting there.
[389:18.06]I don't want to do that.
[389:26.28]He does webcam.
[389:29.22]He almost got me there.
[389:34.23]He does webcam all the time.
[389:35.21]I do webcam all the time, but I don't leave it on.
[389:41.33]Webcam, facecam to me all the time just feels like there's a security camera that's pointing at me.
[389:47.16]You know that feeling you get when you know you're on camera?
[389:50.90]You're standing somewhere, you're out somewhere, you're in a place where you know you are on fucking the security camera.
[389:55.98]And you just are like, oh, okay.
[389:58.28]I'm just on that camera right now, I guess.
[390:00.28]It's like staring at me.
[390:01.28]I don't want to be on Twitch chat security cam.
[390:14.53]But we can tell you when someone's behind you.
[390:18.94]I know that too.
[390:20.50]I have mirrors.
[390:21.44]You guys don't see them.
[390:22.35]I got my monitors here and above them is three huge mirrors to make sure I can always see behind me.
[390:30.05]Have any done webcam for Outlast?
[390:31.43]I do webcam all the time.
[390:35.20]But for me, webcam and facecam has to make sense as to why it's on in the first place.
[390:39.84]If it's a scary game or I'm talking or chatting or hanging out, then yeah.
[390:45.46]But I don't like the Twitch chat security cam.
[390:50.93]You haven't noticed me behind you, though.
[390:54.16]How do you know that I haven't?
[391:05.65]But I'm not... I don't... I'm not against using a webcam.
[391:10.43]I just don't... I don't... I don't... Why do you want to look at my ugly mug?
[391:17.57]I think it detracts from a lot of stuff that happens on the screen.
[391:21.00]Sometimes it doesn't.
[391:21.66]Maybe sometimes it is fun to have it on, and I've done it before.
[391:25.82]It's just my personal preference.
[391:32.26]Hey, thank you, Jen Thura, for the $2.
[391:33.98]After you beat the game, don't forget to check out Instagram.
[391:39.13]Check out Theo's Instagram.
[391:42.25]That's actually real.
[391:43.15]Okay.
[391:45.29]Well, I'm going to do that after I beat the game because I don't know if there might be some spoiler stuff in there that I don't want to see.
[391:49.19]I don't want to see those photos yet.
[391:51.91]But thanks for the link.
[391:54.57]Thank you, Mr. Methany, for the $5.
[391:56.61]No message, thank you.
[391:59.37]Honeychain, thanks for the $1.
[392:00.39]Ouroboros, thanks for the $6.66.
[392:02.21]666, Ouroboros Panda, appreciate it.
[392:08.73]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[392:10.43]Fibley Bibbleys, thanks for the $1.
[392:13.27]I made some goodies from the last stream.
[392:19.17]Oh boy.
[392:19.65]Oh boy.
[392:24.17]Did you... You combined... That's Willem Dafoe's mouth.
[392:29.03]I know what Willem Dafoe's mouth looks like when I see it.
[392:33.51]This second one.
[392:40.88]Oh my god, this is terrifying.
[392:47.92]Ugh.
[392:50.87]That almost looks like it's in the game.
[392:58.49]Thank you, Fibley Bibbleys, for those two great pictures.
[393:02.22]Max Payne.
[393:06.24]Aereo, thanks for the one dollar, Aereo.
[393:10.04]Tay.
[393:11.60]Thank you, Tay.
[393:14.52]For the $2.
[393:15.48]Hey Jerma, the stream was an absolute joy to watch.
[393:17.28]You named your character John, but you had plenty of Jex moments.
[393:20.98]Now that you have more experience with climbing mountains, maybe you can try getting over it again.
[393:28.72]I'm not sure I could do that.
[393:30.35]I don't think I have it in.
[393:33.63]Ariel, thanks for the $2.
[393:34.49]No message.
[393:36.55]Thanks again.
[393:37.85]Tingy, thanks for $1.
[393:38.89]Thank you.
[393:39.21]Mostly lost for the $1.
[393:41.33]Mostly lost.
[393:41.87]Thanks for the $1.
[393:43.11]You're welcome.
[393:46.68]Coordinating.
[393:48.37]Coordination.
[393:50.11]Everskaff, thanks for the $1.
[393:51.67]Hey, Jerma, it's me.
[393:53.47]GoldenFoxy, I want to let you know that I told you so.
[393:56.15]If I get banned, I won't care.
[394:01.30]Wait, hold on a second.
[394:02.14]I'm so confused.
[394:03.96]I'm very confused.
[394:11.87]Wait, let me read this.
[394:16.25]I got a D in my class.
[394:18.17]Also, I found out how you can unban my account.
[394:20.31]Just go to the settings, channels and videos, scroll down and the ban chatters is right there.
[394:24.69]It shows you the username.
[394:30.59]On January 30th, the Wii Shop shuts off forever.
[394:37.92]That's the Wii Shop.
[394:40.58]Does the Wii Shop actually turn off?
[394:49.27]Why would they do that?
[395:00.99]I can't believe they're... I cannot believe they're shutting the Wii Shop off forever.
[395:10.56]Wait, wait, hold on.
[395:11.36]Does that include Wii U?
[395:24.05]Just the Wii.
[395:26.17]So they're Windows 7-ing... the Wii.
[395:31.97]They're making it, they're taking it, no more updates, no more anything.
[395:39.87]More like XP.
[395:40.63]Wasn't Windows 7, the support for Windows 7 stops in 2020?
[395:45.93]That's gonna be a huge deal.
[395:48.27]You want to talk about like the day of reckoning?
[395:50.85]When Windows 7 is no longer officially supported by Microsoft in 2020, what the hell is going to happen there?
[395:58.70]Wait, really?
[395:59.32]Oh, yeah.
[396:00.92]Windows 7 is no longer going to be officially supported by patches next year.
[396:14.05]It's true.
[396:14.69]Oh, yeah, it is.
[396:18.83]Hopefully Windows 10 will be better by then.
[396:23.82]Buy a whole bunch of games and do a shitty Wii stream.
[396:26.20]I think I already did that, didn't I?
[396:28.28]Didn't I?
[396:29.12]I had, you know, I did a lot of Wii stuff a year or two ago.
[396:37.26]But do I have any advice for bullies?
[396:45.23]I mean, the thing about getting picked on and bullies and shit, honestly, you kind of have to, like,
[396:55.72]There's a thing... No, don't bully him back.
[396:58.87]No, no, no, no, no.
[397:01.95]I'm not sure what your friend situation is, but if you can make a few friends, and you can kind of be around them and hang out with them, and it kind of makes it a lot harder for someone to kind of come up to you and be like, oh, hey, fuck you.
[397:17.38]It's like, well, I got two buddies here.
[397:18.56]Like, fuck you, actually.
[397:21.56]There's, like, strength in numbers.
[397:24.27]And a lot of times Bully will kind of pick out and single out somebody.
[397:28.97]And it's really, really unfortunate shit.
[397:44.79]You have to learn to laugh it off and invalidate them.
[397:46.91]Yeah, but it's really hard to do that.
[397:55.40]Really, it sits on, hopefully, in the school system, wherever you are.
[398:01.26]You know, people are looking out for that, watching out for that.
[398:03.30]I feel like in the current year that we're in now, the current generation, I feel like people are starting to really pay attention to it now, or try to.
[398:25.40]Yeah, just ignore them.
[398:26.64]Advice doesn't work.
[398:29.16]No, I don't know why people are just so fucking mean sometimes.
[398:32.58]Really, I don't get it.
[398:35.40]I wish I had a perfect answer.
[398:36.58]I really do.
[398:44.02]No one even tries.
[398:44.74]Everyone just tries to look like they care.
[398:46.70]Yeah.
[399:00.93]In my experience, confronting a bully always kind of scares them off one way or another.
[399:03.91]Not saying physically, but bullies bully people because they think they are weak.
[399:09.65]Yeah, there's a whole lot of complex things going on.
[399:14.57]When it comes to bullies trying to make their friends laugh.
[399:19.05]Trying to, you know, impress somebody.
[399:21.33]Trying to look strong, tough.
[399:23.37]There's so much going on there.
[399:27.97]It's just...
[399:32.63]Laughing it off can help if it's just trash talking.
[399:35.06]Yeah, but... If it gets to a point where there's actual, real, you know, physical consequences, then somebody has to be told about it.
[399:44.28]You know?
[399:45.34]You can't live your life just getting fucking picked on and shit.
[399:49.22]That's just not fun.
[399:50.06]It's not cool.
[400:04.40]Wish people just wouldn't be assholes, but I guess that's too much to ask.
[400:08.48]Yeah... There's a whole... Like I just said, there's a whole lot of complex shit going on as to how it even starts.
[400:17.53]So... I wish I had the perfect answer, but I don't.
[400:21.91]I'm not necessarily qualified to have, like, a perfect answer.
[400:31.00]But I wish you luck.
[400:32.36]Hopefully you can find a way to make, you know, alleviate it or, you know, get the school involved at that point.
[400:46.97]Let somebody know that that shit's going on.
[400:57.52]But thank you.
[401:00.02]Best of luck to you.
[401:02.54]Thank you DoorCube for the $1.
[401:04.08]By the way, if you ever get to be... get to a part of the game you just can't beat, especially in the B-sides, there's invincibility and infinite dash cheats in the options menu.
[401:13.12]They help less than expert players see all the game has to offer.
[401:18.20]They help less than expert players.
[401:21.25]Well, I haven't done them yet.
[401:22.59]I did the first B-sides without a problem.
[401:27.71]We'll see.
[401:28.27]Hold on to that thought there.
[401:37.40]Because I haven't done it yet.
[401:40.72]But thank you, Everscar, for the $3 here.
[401:45.50]Since you have a Wii and the other systems, what consoles do I own?
[401:53.29]I don't have any other consoles at the moment because I moved.
[401:57.45]Besides what's in the closet right here.
[402:00.07]PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, SEGA Dreamcast.
[402:02.81]And obviously PlayStation 4.
[402:05.60]I don't have the Xbox One anymore, although I cannibalized the controller here.
[402:15.30]I should get an original Xbox.
[402:22.88]I didn't have an Xbox before.
[402:27.04]I never had an original Xbox.
[402:29.68]But what's on an original Xbox that's not on a PS3?
[402:32.26]Besides Halo.
[402:39.84]This Halo... What else was an exclusive for the original Xbox?
[402:43.86]Jet Set Radio Future.
[402:47.34]Gears of War.
[402:47.86]That's true.
[402:48.36]Gears of War is on there.
[402:49.24]But I didn't really play Gears of War.
[402:51.66]Even when I transitioned to the 360, because I had a 360.
[403:01.25]But, thank you.
[403:01.87]Thank you, FGW, for the $1 Twitch try to get me with the purchase failed shenanigans again.
[403:06.65]But I didn't fall for it this time.
[403:09.06]My boyfriend and I are going to Broadway next month to see a musical called Be More Chill.
[403:13.86]Not sure if it'd be your cup of tea, but if you want to check it out, it's great.
[403:16.49]You're the best as always.
[403:17.79]Well, thank you.
[403:19.69]Be More Chill.
[403:22.77]It's the first I've ever heard of it.
[403:27.01]Mostly lost.
[403:27.55]Thanks for the $1.
[403:28.23]Your analogies never make any sense, but we love them anyways.
[403:31.59]I think that one makes sense.
[403:35.75]And Everscar asks you to get a SEGA Dreamcast.
[403:38.49]Probably not.
[403:41.25]Because... I mean, obviously... Meh.
[403:45.07]They're actually... That's a hard question to answer.
[403:50.98]Because there really are a ton of games that you can't play anywhere else besides on a Dreamcast.
[404:00.14]Depends.
[404:01.04]How much you value oddities that you've never seen before.
[404:06.81]What if Jerma doesn't actually have a Dreamcast and he's delaying it because he doesn't want to tell him?
[404:24.82]How's that for a delay?
[404:26.46]Huh?
[404:28.83]How's that for a delay?
[404:37.52]That's a fake box?
[404:41.08]That I painted.
[404:41.76]No, it's not.
[404:50.21]This is real.
[404:51.41]I got it out of the closet.
[404:52.41]Now it's out.
[404:52.91]That means it has to happen soon.
[404:53.89]I'm going to leave it right here.
[404:59.78]Hey, dubskidoo.
[405:00.46]We're almost done with bits.
[405:01.26]Just a little bit more.
[405:03.66]Let's rapid-fire these, what do you say?
[405:05.28]Holy shit, that's horrible.
[405:06.19]Everyone, please be careful when operating walk-in ovens.
[405:46.99]Sorry, uh... I think I got- I think you got me.
[405:52.17]Yeah.
[405:55.52]Is that- is this fake?
[405:56.42]Is it fake?
[405:57.16]It's fake, right?
[405:59.30]It's fake.
[405:59.94]Is it?
[406:00.18]I don't know.
[406:00.90]I can't say that it is, because what if it isn't?
[406:02.54]I don't know!
[406:04.22]I know the end is- ah, no.
[406:06.17]Alright.
[406:06.79]Thank you for the one dollar.
[406:07.73]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the one dollar.
[406:10.71]I watched the VOD of 700,000 games, and every time you came back from a BRB, there was a dick on the screen.
[406:16.10]It was just like you were a teacher being like, haha, very funny kids.
[406:20.18]Much love.
[406:23.62]Musty face cloth, thanks for the $1.
[406:25.70]My favorite song, Enhanced.
[406:29.37]What is that?
[406:39.07]It was very loud.
[406:39.87]I'm really sorry.
[406:45.50]Thank you, DoorCube, for the $1.
[406:46.68]I want to know what your thought process was when you were about to sneeze earlier and your first thought was, I better turn the webcam on so my audience and Joel's audience can see it.
[407:00.21]Because the first 700,000 game stream, I don't know what I was doing.
[407:05.17]Didn't I do that before?
[407:09.31]I don't know.
[407:15.66]Anyone have a clip on hand?
[407:21.02]I tried.
[407:21.54]You tried to sneeze before and it never happened.
[407:33.67]What was that?
[407:34.11]No, no, I ended up, I did sneeze like the day after.
[407:42.35]Thank you to Eviscraft for the $3 here.
[407:46.27]They said... I can recall from Movie Night there were two shows that had edited you in which it was the best crossover ever.
[407:54.48]But anyways, that show was Ed, Edd, and Eddie.
[407:58.02]Really hope I know what Ed... Yeah, I know what Ed, Edd, and Eddie is.
[408:02.46]It's a great show.
[408:08.34]Have I named my SEGA Dreamcast?
[408:10.22]I'm going to call it SEGA.
[408:16.23]Wait, what is in here?
[408:21.08]Compatible with Microsoft Windows CE.
[408:26.94]What is Windows CE?
[408:35.46]Thank you, IkeTurtle, for the $1.
[408:36.80]Here's what your face reminded me of.
[408:38.20]Oh, the scream.
[408:44.35]No, it's C. It's not M-E.
[408:45.41]It's C-E.
[408:45.79]It's very clear, yeah.
[408:48.69]C-E.
[408:50.80]Windows Combat Evolved.
[409:04.70]And then Everskaf gave another $5 here, talking about Star Wars Republic Commando.
[409:11.08]Instead of doing Dreamcast, do the Wii.
[409:15.22]Uh... I already did.
[409:18.24]I did the Wii.
[409:19.49]A lot.
[409:20.77]I did an entire Wii stream.
[409:22.97]Three of them in a row, I think, right?
[409:24.15]Like, a year ago?
[409:27.39]Compact Windows.
[409:36.29]And have I checked out the Jerma lore?
[409:37.60]I have seen the Jerma lore wiki.
[409:43.16]You have 200 Star Wars shirts, so Star Wars games would be fitting.
[409:48.65]Yeah, I did, uh... What games did I do for the Wii?
[409:51.49]I did that shootout game, I did... I did a lot of the Wii Shop exclusives, didn't I?
[409:59.96]I did, like, the eating game, the... Yeah, there's at least...
[410:04.21]Three or four streams of kind of shovelware Wii games.
[410:07.61]I did a lot of them.
[410:16.36]But that is going to take us to the end.
[410:17.50]Let's take a look at the credits.
[410:23.20]That's not the credits button.
[410:24.74]That's the camera button.
[410:29.20]Yes, yes.
[410:30.34]Let us click on the credits button.
[410:34.46]Look at this fucking gremlin.
[410:45.05]Thank you, everybody.
[410:45.81]They were an absolute shitload of community subs tonight, so... And tons of bits and tons of money.
[410:52.45]You guys are fucking so... You guys are so amazing.
[410:58.10]Thank you.
[411:05.21]When is Jerma Gremlin gonna be?
[411:10.39]Have Shito sing over the credits.
[411:12.77]What song?
[411:13.19]Star Wars?
[411:13.67]Because, I mean, everyone keeps talking about it.
[411:15.37]Wait.
[412:20.41]It's hard to go up and d-d-d-d- It's hard to go up and down this little tube, look.
[412:37.04]I have to like go like this.
[412:38.48]It's not just like a simple like
[412:50.21]Boy, that's actually better.
[413:06.78]Wiggle your finger.
[413:08.68]How about this one?
[413:28.02]I'm trying to Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[413:43.52]Super Mario Brothers?
[413:44.40]No.
[413:48.95]Don't listen to them, it's perfect.
[413:50.03]You've got the glass smash.
[413:54.85]How about one more?
[413:55.51]One more!
[413:55.89]One more!
[413:56.37]How about, what, give me, uh, give me something.
[414:06.33]Dancing Queen.
