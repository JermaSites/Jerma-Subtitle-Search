[ve:61.1.100]

[00:06.95]Alright, so should I just have this as my webcam?
[00:17.37]We should go here.
[00:19.75]This is not even... You can very clearly tell that I'm squatting.
[00:24.32]Alright, let's go.
[00:24.90]You guys ready?
[00:25.98]Let's see if I still got it.
[00:26.80]I tell you, I did get through the first period here.
[00:29.12]This is the one I'm going to use.
[00:39.47]I think Wu-Chang is an action RPG.
[00:44.71]I think it's in the... Well, let's see how buttery it is first of all.
[00:50.20]It's important.
[00:55.89]It's extremely buttery.
[01:03.55]Put a dead center in the screen?
[01:05.00]No!
[01:05.40]I want people to see the gameplay.
[01:06.56]Well, I want you to see the gameplay.
[01:08.90]So I did do the intro.
[01:10.00]I already did the first 10-15 minutes.
[01:13.28]Just don't explain it.
[01:23.38]We want the gnome on there.
[01:26.92]Actually, it is kind of... Being able to still be able to do that at 40.
[01:30.67]Squat down like that and hold that position for that long.
[01:35.58]Well, well.
[01:36.70]Look who's back.
[01:38.55]Feeling lost, are we?
[01:41.25]Why is your waist so small?
[01:42.57]That's my arms.
[01:43.75]We are both wanderers of fate.
[01:45.58]No need for formalities.
[01:47.98]Now, about the power in your left arm.
[01:53.05]If you master it, you'll be unstoppable.
[01:57.13]You might even rewrite destiny as we know it.
[02:00.86]Don't believe me, eh?
[02:03.46]Okay, so I think this is... I'll give you a quick TL;DR.
[02:07.55]There was an attack by a big monster, and everybody that was attacked has essentially become infected by the feathering.
[02:16.77]They kind of start growing feathers, and I think I'm one of those people that's been infected.
[02:29.26]The bell Pinwheel.
[02:30.90]I'm getting flashbacks.
[02:32.46]Alright.
[02:32.72]Press dodge at the right moment to shimmer and avoid an enemy move.
[02:35.99]Grants one stack of skyborne might.
[02:38.77]That increases the potency of spells.
[02:42.29]Okay.
[02:42.41]So dodge.
[02:45.78]Alright.
[02:46.00]You got heavy attack, light attack.
[02:47.68]Let's go.
[02:49.42]It's time for some extremely buttery gameplay.
[02:53.39]I actually do need to see if I still have this.
[02:55.35]Like, do I still got it?
[02:58.43]Is there a jump?
[02:58.90]No.
[03:01.54]Okay.
[03:16.02]It actually is a Pinwheel.
[03:30.34]And again, Wu Chang is on PC Game Pass right now as well as hundreds of other high quality games that you can enjoy.
[03:40.46]Now let me show you the power of the Predator Orion 7000 player.
[03:57.81]Oh shit.
[04:07.30]Alright, so that's a heal.
[04:16.78]So I'm getting like shimmer points.
[04:17.98]Hold on.
[04:25.15]I think I just did a special move.
[04:43.23]Oh shit, hold on.
[04:44.39]How many heals do I have?
[04:45.31]One or two?
[04:46.09]Okay, two in the lower right.
[05:03.07]This guy is fucking hard!
[05:12.57]Oh shit, I'm gonna lose.
[05:19.20]I don't have any heals left.
[05:20.20]Uh oh.
[05:33.32]He's bad.
[05:34.46]I think that's the first fight of the game.
[05:38.65]You're blocking the health bar.
[05:39.99]Alright, get this shit out of here.
[05:43.71]You died to Pinwheel.
[05:44.71]I know.
[05:45.17]Yeah, I know.
[05:45.61]I know.
[05:47.31]Okay.
[05:48.25]That's a scripted death.
[05:51.94]Dropping to zero health results in your death.
[05:53.36]Yeah.
[05:54.02]Makes you drop red Mercury based on your current madness.
[05:57.96]Which you revived at the shrine you left.
[05:59.54]Okay.
[05:59.66]Sorry.
[05:59.84]I remember I touched this.
[06:01.68]Head back to the place you fell to reclaim all the red Mercury that you lost.
[06:06.39]Maddening incense increases madness when used and also prevents the loss of madness for a time.
[06:10.49]Alright.
[06:15.33]I have a Refine Red Mercury.
[06:20.82]I really didn't do anything.
[06:21.82]I kind of just walked out of the starting area after the cutscenes.
[06:26.47]This is how you level up, right?
[06:27.53]Okay.
[06:33.08]Okay.
[06:36.88]So this is... I say I have Stamina, Vitality, Endurance, Strength, Agility, Feathering, and Magic.
[06:45.50]Uh, Refine Red Mercury.
[06:48.59]Oh, I can get one.
[06:49.33]Okay.
[06:51.09]Now I have one Red Mercury.
[06:55.20]Which way should I go?
[06:56.36]Skyborn Call or Sword Saint?
[06:59.57]Second attack of a long sword light attack combo grants one stack of Skyborn Might.
[07:05.10]Which one of these is better?
[07:09.40]Sword Saint is better?
[07:10.47]Sword Saint always.
[07:11.87]Okay.
[07:15.58]Okay, so that opens up the... Ah!
[07:17.88]Alright, so you don't just put points into... Oh, I'll put three points in vitality.
[07:25.65]You actually have to pick them on the tree.
[07:28.29]That's interesting.
[07:28.93]Okay.
[07:33.42]What's his next move?
[07:35.12]Consume one stack of skyborne might to quickly strike with charged heavy longsword.
[07:38.89]I think there's different weapons, too.
[07:41.97]I think this opens up on the right side.
[07:43.29]Alright, so I got that.
[07:50.52]Put the gnome cam back.
[07:54.97]Alright, stand off perspective.
[07:56.73]You can adjust the camera.
[07:59.52]Stand off as a dynamic angle for a visual experience.
[08:03.11]Or classic.
[08:04.59]Or stable view.
[08:06.27]You can switch.
[08:06.79]I think this is fine.
[08:07.67]I think this looks good.
[08:13.32]So everyone's kind of infected?
[08:20.54]Alright, which way should I go?
[08:21.70]This way?
[08:22.37]Should I try to fight that boss again?
[08:24.15]Probably not until I level up, right?
[08:34.24]Lantern Fruit.
[08:36.26]I'll go this way.
[08:36.76]Why not?
[08:39.04]This game looks so pretty.
[08:39.97]I can't believe it runs so well on the Predator Orion 7000.
[08:45.51]I can't believe it either.
[08:48.44]OK, I'll joke aside.
[08:49.68]This computer is a beast and it is.
[08:52.30]It does look great and it runs great too.
[08:55.49]Anytime I would try to stream a game like this before, even though I had a 3090 and that thing was doing all the work.
[09:04.22]These fans don't even sound like they're on.
[09:05.90]I'll be honest with you.
[09:08.14]And it's running is running clean.
[09:12.57]New weapon.
[09:17.48]Blunt.
[09:19.08]I did just do long sword, didn't I?
[09:21.27]I need to stay with long sword, don't I?
[09:23.71]Is your room actually cooler now?
[09:26.14]I feel like the answer to that question is yes.
[09:28.78]I feel like it used to get to like 84, 85 degrees in here and it's now it's 81, 80.
[09:32.31]It's like 80 to 81.
[09:36.67]So it is.
[09:40.36]Even four or five degrees difference is a huge deal.
[09:42.98]it's me who are you you wrote to me about searching worship's rise for clues about by you have you forgotten okay are you your sister we came here to find clues I think that's a shrine right the old boatman spoke true he warned of feathers growing on the arm
[10:05.41]A mark of feathering.
[10:07.45]They say it leads to memory loss.
[10:09.49]Is your room next to an oven?
[10:10.85]No.
[10:11.35]It ultimately turns one into a man-eating monster.
[10:16.96]Okay, I got a cornucopia elixir.
[10:18.62]You can still speak for now.
[10:21.37]Take this.
[10:23.19]I'll counsel my friend, the old boatman.
[10:26.40]Yeah, as of right now, if this was the other computer I was using, all I would hear, even with headphones in, I would hear... That is not doing that.
[10:47.30]Alright, let's go.
[10:52.46]So I can kind of jump back too.
[10:53.79]Alright.
[10:58.70]red Mercury sprout I should read what all these items do alright okay alright let me be honest I have since I've gotten this computer this is like the last like two games I've played really
[11:19.25]are the actual seeing what this computer can do because I've been playing like fucking you know puke simulator and stuff I haven't really played a game that looks like this in like a month or two since I've had this alright I can trigger shimmer to avoid an enemy move alright so do that by you can learn unique weapon mechanics alright so it's a perfect dodge right and it's lb
[11:50.35]Deflecting and blocking allow you to counter.
[11:52.21]Alright, so you can deflect and then block.
[12:07.00]Oh.
[12:07.08]Let's see if I get a perfect... There we go.
[12:09.50]Ooh, alright, alright, alright.
[12:10.82]So perfect dodges then lead into these left bumper, left trigger moves.
[12:18.11]Here we go.
[12:20.14]Do it again.
[12:25.64]You can equip three pendants.
[12:28.31]Using the pendants that best fit your weapon and style will give you an advantage.
[12:30.39]Alright, cool.
[12:31.29]Equipment.
[12:32.25]You got it.
[12:37.96]Reduces damage taken while below a certain HP threshold.
[12:40.38]Let's put it on.
[12:48.01]Yeah, walking around in RoboCop and then walking around in this was like, oh.
[12:51.20]Oh!
[12:52.66]Oh!
[12:58.19]Five health pills.
[12:59.23]I think I can... It's probably consumable.
[13:05.17]Is that bird friendly?
[13:14.28]Oh my god!
[13:15.23]Did I not have done that?
[13:17.92]That bird was friendly.
[13:19.36]I was not threatened by that bird at all.
[13:23.12]Genuinely, completely not threatened at all.
[13:27.77]I just lost all my shit.
[13:29.61]I thought I can't walk in the stream?
[13:31.57]I saw the chest over there.
[13:32.75]I wanted to get the treasure chest.
[13:36.56]Okay.
[13:36.68]Alright, well.
[13:44.04]I'll get back to it quick.
[13:47.11]Oh shit, actually that was over there.
[13:59.79]Get back there quick.
[14:06.44]Don't kill the bird this time.
[14:07.60]I'm not gonna.
[14:18.19]Maybe the bird feather disease makes you weak to water?
[14:22.62]I would not be surprised.
[14:24.58]Alright, so I can't go over there.
[14:31.67]I almost want to look over there though.
[14:37.80]Wait, I got to get my stuff back, right?
[14:46.31]I'm going to do the cool move.
[14:47.07]Do it.
[14:47.96]I can just do it anyways.
[14:54.41]Alright, let's go.
[14:55.95]How much is it to make a Mercury stone or whatever it is?
[15:06.17]Alright, so I can't go that way.
[15:09.72]Wait, can I talk to you?
[15:12.80]I almost just fell off again.
[15:17.76]Wait, say it again?
[15:29.18]Is it?
[15:37.96]So is everybody kind of infected or just me?
[15:44.71]How you managed to contain it?
[15:47.27]I don't know.
[15:48.05]But make no mistake.
[15:50.78]Your left arm is the key to unleashing its full strength.
[15:57.23]Okay.
[15:57.59]Yes, that power is itching.
[15:59.93]I want that chest so bad.
[16:01.67]But I'm afraid you're not ready to command it.
[16:05.96]Not yet.
[16:07.72]Here, take this.
[16:10.06]Let's see if you've got what it takes to wield
[16:14.98]Alright, let's go.
[16:16.91]What does that do?
[16:24.01]No, it's right here.
[16:26.10]A mature plant nourished by red Mercury.
[16:27.90]Its crystallization beginning to take shape.
[16:29.44]Red Mercury can be seen flowing within it.
[16:32.12]What does it do?
[16:35.03]Oh, okay.
[16:36.11]Oh, it's a crunchy.
[16:37.17]Okay, so this is this game's crunchies.
[16:43.71]I'm gonna wrap around for sure.
[16:49.86]Oh, that's where I died.
[16:50.70]I think I had to have heard the conversation we had down there.
[17:02.84]The bird is gone forever now?
[17:04.22]I feel like I was supposed to do that.
[17:06.20]Was I not supposed to do that?
[17:17.29]Swift Draw.
[17:17.93]When equipped with two weapons, you can consume Skyborne Might to unleash a powerful Swift Draw.
[17:28.77]Oh, shit.
[17:31.99]I kind of... Alright, hold on.
[17:41.03]Weapon skills become more potent when used while you have ample guy-born might.
[17:49.82]I thought he was gonna fall off.
[18:04.47]I kind of like the heavy weapon.
[18:10.46]Are you... Can I help you?
[18:12.65]I don't think I can do anything.
[18:13.43]Can I not rescue this guy or whatever?
[18:15.72]Oh my god.
[18:18.36]Hey, why does this game look so buttery?
[18:20.53]The graphics are amazing.
[18:21.59]What computer are you using?
[18:41.70]Cool.
[18:42.92]Alright.
[18:43.36]I got 710 Mercury.
[18:51.47]A little shortcut.
[18:54.75]Is that a shortcut?
[18:55.31]Maybe I should go down.
[19:01.10]Oh, that would hurt so bad.
[19:03.46]That hurts just looking up.
[19:06.86]Alright, just want to make sure I don't miss anything.
[19:08.00]Alright, so this is a different way to go.
[19:13.72]I should probably touch the thing before I come down here, right?
[19:22.46]What did I just get?
[19:23.88]Vorpal Blade?
[19:25.66]Cast spells.
[19:29.91]Where's my spells?
[19:35.13]How do I cast this?
[19:36.11]Why to cast a spell?
[19:37.19]How do I equip spells?
[19:40.28]What menu is that?
[19:46.28]That wasn't a spell, but that... Okay.
[19:49.86]Cool.
[19:50.26]Very cool.
[19:53.25]Very cool.
[19:58.24]Another spell?
[20:02.56]Second tab of your menu.
[20:04.21]Oh, there it is.
[20:04.65]Okay, so this is equipped, right?
[20:08.39]So it's Y to... Okay.
[20:10.08]Requires Skyborn Might.
[20:15.01]Ooh, did I just hit somebody?
[20:18.39]Got a lot of range.
[20:19.20]Alright, let's go.
[20:21.23]Cool.
[20:21.35]I thought that guy just turned into a pot.
[20:31.33]So you string together combos to get what is technically mana to cast spells like this.
[20:40.04]I'm usually a spell user.
[20:41.60]I might do spells.
[20:45.39]I have to beat the first little area first.
[20:47.63]Go back and touch the thing.
[20:49.93]Whoa.
[20:52.42]Alright, let me go back and touch the thing.
[20:59.38]I'll come right back here.
[21:06.03]Because I should level up.
[21:18.06]How long do you usually stream for?
[21:19.80]I'll probably be live for.
[21:22.25]I like.
[21:23.75]5, 4 to 6 hours, maybe 5 to 7 hours today.
[21:27.35]I imagine.
[21:29.30]Alright, let's do this.
[21:34.12]I'm going to probably use the crunchy too.
[21:41.31]Okay.
[21:44.54]Where is that?
[21:45.02]1500.
[21:46.40]Alright, I'm going to be able to level up like three times.
[21:52.01]Any more of these?
[21:54.28]Increases madness when used and also prevents the loss of madness.
[21:58.07]What are these?
[21:59.31]Contains 100 Mercury.
[22:01.09]Oh, these are crunchies as well.
[22:11.72]right what should I put points in you can teleport to where you've been I imagine yep repopulate the map yep if the character's grayscale portrait appears in the teleportation list it means you have yet to complete their quest in that area oh okay cool alright refine red Mercury okay so I can I can get three Mercury essence
[22:41.56]What do you think?
[22:41.96]Strength?
[22:45.70]Strength?
[22:46.22]Strength.
[22:47.78]This is plus 5 strength.
[22:49.00]Damn.
[22:50.29]Alright, I'm going straight down.
[22:54.87]Wait, at max level?
[22:56.39]I can do it multiple times?
[23:01.32]Oh, it's a 1 out of 1.
[23:02.06]Alright.
[23:02.74]Cool.
[23:05.66]And then I get this.
[23:07.70]One stack of Skyborn Might to quickly strike with a charged... Yeah, let's do that.
[23:15.14]So I should do way more damage now.
[23:26.38]Maybe I should use the... This is the long sword tree, but I feel like this axe is strength, isn't it?
[23:35.30]I don't know why I thought I could just jump from here.
[23:48.99]The respecs are always free.
[23:52.05]Alright, that's cool.
[23:52.65]So if you just kind of want to change, you can just do it whenever you want.
[23:58.78]I'm going to keep this out for now.
[24:01.02]This is definitely a strength weapon.
[24:04.87]Oops.
[24:09.13]Left bumper, right bumper, right bumper, right bumper.
[24:15.40]I see, okay.
[24:16.90]Strength?
[24:18.24]Six?
[24:19.56]This scales better, I think.
[24:22.41]I want to try it, though.
[24:23.03]I want to use it for a little bit.
[24:25.33]Left bumper, right bumper, right bumper, right bumper, right bumper.
[24:37.87]Lunging attack.
[24:38.83]Yep.
[24:44.29]I barely missed.
[24:48.77]I tried it.
[24:49.25]Whatever.
[24:51.78]Get spelled.
[25:00.87]Get away from me.
[25:07.13]You gotta get the perfect dodges.
[25:10.30]There we go.
[25:10.70]So now I can do this.
[25:14.71]Okay, I get it.
[25:16.44]It's all about... You need at least one perfect dodge to do the cool moves.
[25:21.34]Should I kill this guy?
[25:35.34]Alright, you think I'll beat the first boss or whatever the first boss I see is?
[25:38.18]Wow, okay.
[25:38.80]Well, here we go.
[25:42.63]Relentlessly attacking or charging up heavy attacks and striking small to medium-sized humanoids from behind can cause them to lose their balance, leaving them vulnerable to an obliterate attack.
[25:55.16]Position yourself in front or behind the minix you like.
[25:57.76]Okay, so it's like a big Brit move.
[26:01.23]Where is he?
[26:02.63]Oh, right there.
[26:03.17]Can I do a plunging attack?
[26:05.43]Tang Palace Maid.
[26:16.19]Oh shit.
[26:19.92]Let's go.
[26:23.08]Light it up!
[26:24.70]I'm sorry.
[26:35.92]Cool.
[26:38.78]Oh, this thing has a huge stagger.
[26:43.10]I want to do my combo.
[26:53.05]Get fucking destroyed.
[26:54.63]Got it.
[27:11.40]That was the teach you how to play boss.
[27:15.23]I'll take it though.
[27:16.09]Alright, benedictions come in three types.
[27:17.45]Oath, wisdom, and memory.
[27:19.03]You can socket benedictions into weapons or remove them at shrines.
[27:24.38]Alright, so it's a kind of a mod then.
[27:27.79]Skyborn might reduce his damage taken for a time.
[27:29.35]Cool.
[27:33.22]That's in.
[27:34.60]I like this thing a lot.
[27:35.26]I'm going to use it more.
[27:40.15]You sound like the hype guy at a child's birthday party.
[27:44.63]Hey, everybody!
[27:45.29]Hey, kids!
[27:46.23]Whoa!
[27:47.52]It's... Well, I'm not the clown.
[27:49.46]But I want to introduce you to... Can we please get everybody to stand up?
[27:53.66]Stand up!
[27:54.52]Hey, come on Timmy, stand up in the back there!
[27:57.37]It's my pleasure to introduce Funny the Clown!
[28:00.55]Not me!
[28:01.94]I'm here to collect the money and I manage Funny.
[28:04.54]But here he comes!
[28:14.00]Forgotten Remembrance.
[28:15.68]What's that?
[28:25.77]Here comes Funny.
[28:28.22]Funny walks out and he just smells like cigarettes.
[28:32.10]He does, you know, two or three balloon animals.
[28:40.92]Where is that item?
[28:41.46]Alright, well, I got that.
[28:43.66]I'll look at it later.
[28:45.29]Wait, will this girl think I'm cool because I just did that?
[28:55.73]Different inventory tabs.
[28:59.11]Oh shit, I do.
[29:01.91]Wait, what is it?
[29:02.47]Oh, I have this.
[29:03.32]Put this on.
[29:13.47]Valuables.
[29:16.53]Items.
[29:18.35]It's called Remembrance, right?
[29:23.74]Oh, I don't see it.
[29:31.99]You scrolled past it five times?
[29:33.71]Did I actually?
[29:34.51]Oh, it's this thing.
[29:37.78]It looked like it was lit up a little differently.
[29:40.52]Alright, use for the mana capacity node at the repository.
[29:44.13]Okay, cool.
[29:46.19]So, I think it's probably a charge.
[29:48.72]A healing charge with this thing.
[29:51.84]Hey, he's 40.
[29:52.48]Relax.
[29:52.86]Hey, I'm 40.
[30:00.73]Excuse me!
[30:22.15]Can you put a giant cone hat on for my birthday?
[30:26.31]I am not doing that.
[30:28.22]I have a happy birthday soon.
[30:42.34]I love the axe.
[30:44.71]I need to go down axe tree.
[30:52.84]That's a new weapon.
[31:01.67]I'll try it.
[31:08.02]Uh, that's cool.
[31:14.15]Spear weapon?
[31:16.39]Spear weapon is actually kind of fun in a lot of games like this.
[31:20.98]What's the special move on this?
[31:24.42]I'll try it for a little bit.
[31:27.56]The biggest problem I ever have when I play a new game like this, when I start a new game like this is... What item do I want to use?
[31:34.63]And I just equip everything and I just mess up my whole build.
[31:37.59]New armor.
[31:44.34]Delicate armor.
[31:48.15]Oh, cool.
[31:48.41]Alright.
[31:51.01]Can I put anything else on?
[31:59.27]Is it like fashion?
[32:04.69]Does this give me any stats?
[32:09.92]Okay, I just lose a lot of stats if I go that way.
[32:28.55]Is that on the button?
[32:33.31]Golden leg wraps.
[32:38.72]Let's put those on.
[32:43.61]Oh, these are... No, no, no, no.
[32:48.17]You were punished.
[32:48.98]Anything else over here besides that troll wall that shoots at you?
[32:58.51]I don't think so.
[33:05.54]You fucking idiot, because now I'm going to fall off with you.
[33:14.57]Now that's the power of the predator Orion.
[33:19.54]Wait, I can't do that.
[33:30.36]Can I?
[33:33.10]I died when I fell into that lake or stream.
[33:36.54]This isn't gonna kill me?
[33:37.99]I have way too much shinies.
[33:38.97]This isn't gonna kill me, right?
[33:43.43]There's a path.
[33:46.96]You shouldn't have told me there was a path, man.
[33:50.06]Wait, that path doesn't work either.
[33:51.88]Wait, hold on.
[33:57.83]I was going to just drop down.
[33:58.83]I was going to go for it.
[34:15.23]I think that's the guy that fell down.
[34:25.08]Oh my... Holy shit, that hurt.
[34:34.03]Oh, I have no heals.
[34:34.69]Alright, don't... I can't fuck around.
[34:35.73]Give me the axe.
[34:38.41]I can't mess around right now.
[34:46.66]I don't want to lose... Wait.
[34:48.56]I think I have... That's a heal, I think, isn't it?
[34:50.64]I should put it on my bar.
[34:55.10]Okay, steamed bunny bun.
[34:58.76]It's a steamed bun in the shape of a bunny.
[35:00.97]Oh, that's cool.
[35:02.17]And then I got health pellets, right?
[35:05.38]Yeah.
[35:07.28]Alright, so now I want to... I think it's... Yeah, this way.
[35:14.68]Good.
[35:15.22]Need another one.
[35:20.73]I need one of those shrines or, uh, stones are there.
[35:24.71]Fire pot.
[35:27.32]Special items you pick up during your journey can be equipped onto your item bar.
[35:30.38]Yep.
[35:31.96]These can be highly effective in situa- Well, I think they want me to do that right now.
[35:34.98]They do.
[35:48.91]Another bird.
[35:54.82]Dark Frost Edge.
[35:58.82]It's a one-handed sword.
[36:00.02]Spell power up, though.
[36:03.29]Alright, I'm getting a lot of weapons early.
[36:07.40]That's cool.
[36:13.62]It's fast.
[36:15.57]What's the other move look like?
[36:16.61]Alright, I want to get a better view of that.
[36:21.64]Come on.
[36:26.47]This thing is actually pretty sick.
[36:27.46]Alright.
[36:28.28]I'm going to keep it on, but I'll... Wait, this looks like you're going to get attacked by some area.
[36:33.17]A shrine.
[36:42.24]Hold X button for quick use of your items.
[36:44.53]Okay.
[36:48.19]Well, I'm doing strength, so I'm going to keep going strength.
[36:56.56]shit wait I can um reset my points right the fourth attack of an axe light attack combo grants three stacks of skyborne might if it hits an enemy that's kind of good I am going this way let's reset
[37:27.83]We're going up this way.
[37:32.40]Okay.
[37:33.02]Strength.
[37:34.56]The third attack of an Axe Light combo restores some stamina.
[37:40.05]I need to make more Essence.
[37:47.00]Alright.
[37:47.18]Vitality.
[37:48.62]Endurance.
[37:52.28]I need to use the block a lot more if that's the case then.
[37:54.31]Alright, what about over here?
[37:55.67]You can consume one stack to quickly strike with charged heavy attack.
[38:00.30]Or... Attack speed.
[38:05.97]I need... I haven't gone health.
[38:09.90]And this one.
[38:11.78]And... Axe Mastery 1.
[38:14.46]Oh, I need some more.
[38:15.15]I need a faint red feather.
[38:17.53]Do I still have a garden?
[38:18.97]I do.
[38:20.09]We grew... We were growing butterfly weed.
[38:23.82]But it didn't bloom.
[38:25.00]It just stayed tall.
[38:26.76]It didn't really do anything.
[38:27.58]It just stayed... It's still there.
[38:28.95]I think it might take a season or two to bloom.
[38:31.75]It didn't bloom.
[38:38.16]Alright, that sounds good.
[38:41.16]Where are axe?
[38:42.01]What about this benediction thing?
[38:44.23]Right, already going on.
[38:47.89]Butterfly weed?
[38:48.59]Yeah, it was... I... I want to say it was... Oh, can I, um... I think I have to enter the dream.
[38:58.10]Rest this... Oh, okay, yeah.
[38:59.48]Let's do that.
[39:09.32]Uh, didn't I get a way to make the... another charge?
[39:15.12]Have you seen very many monarchs laying eggs?
[39:17.01]Not really.
[39:17.63]How do I activate the... Where is it?
[39:31.68]I think I have to use it here, right?
[39:37.50]Right here.
[39:42.07]No, I don't want to put it in the warehouse.
[39:47.62]How do I use it?
[39:50.37]Can I just be standing here?
[39:57.50]Used for the mana capacity node in the Impetus repository.
[40:02.59]So it's in there.
[40:03.55]Where is it?
[40:07.90]Reset points, pop-up options.
[40:10.08]Pop-up options?
[40:11.54]Am I missing it?
[40:11.98]Is it like over here?
[40:18.13]Oh, there it is.
[40:20.56]No, where is it?
[40:35.98]Left one and then up?
[40:41.09]Red Mercury.
[40:41.61]Oh, is it actually in the tree tree here?
[41:00.24]Direct left.
[41:06.49]Blink, kick, burial, bulwark, flickering blade.
[41:12.88]Maybe it's not available yet.
[41:16.38]Looks like it's probably not available.
[41:17.48]Alright.
[41:24.87]What's your deal?
[41:27.96]Let's help him.
[41:36.32]I just stepped out for a breather and ran into a fine woman.
[41:48.55]Who are you?
[41:49.95]Name's Wu-Gang.
[41:51.77]I'm Dutanga's right hand.
[41:54.10]I take care of the big jobs.
[41:58.08]Those temple fools keep sniffing around for my treasure.
[42:01.95]Soon as I send word to the boss, we're moving out.
[42:11.72]Okay, I didn't... I was just testing to see if NPCs like this guy could be attacked.
[42:17.52]Just testing.
[42:19.09]Ugh.
[42:20.58]Ugh!
[42:22.16]Ugh!
[42:24.61]That's gnarly, holy shit!
[42:30.46]Oh my goodness!
[42:32.91]Hey!
[42:35.15]Ugh!
[42:36.58]Ugh!
[42:42.25]Man, sometimes having the graphical fidelity of the Predator Orion 7000 has got its drawbacks, right?
[42:50.12]Look at that!
[42:54.34]It's so clear and the graphics are unbelievable!
[43:06.82]You can see every bone.
[43:08.38]You can see every... pendant.
[43:22.93]It actually does look crazy though.
[43:24.35]Let's be real.
[43:27.52]I put everything on.
[43:28.30]I think it's on the default setting it was on was extreme.
[43:31.78]Where graphical fidelity is.
[43:33.10]I think it was on.
[43:35.76]And if you have a graphic setting called extreme.
[43:38.77]That's kind of crazy.
[43:47.32]I think I turned off motion blur.
[43:50.06]And screen shake.
[43:52.94]Everything else should be on high, high, high.
[43:56.20]Or ultra or extreme.
[44:02.18]This dude's never been outside before.
[44:09.23]You're saying that to me of all people?
[44:13.27]I play catch with myself at least once a week, okay?
[44:16.31]I throw the ball in the air, the baseball with the glove on, and I catch it.
[44:18.56]I do big pop-ups for myself, okay?
[44:21.38]I pretend like a big puppy hit a big pop-up for me, okay?
[44:28.95]Alright, I can't.
[44:29.85]I gotta shut up.
[44:33.96]That's not heal.
[44:39.45]Okay.
[44:44.19]Give me a stack.
[44:52.06]I like that combo.
[45:01.93]Why would you go outside when you have a Predator Orion 7000 that does buttery smooth gameplay?
[45:09.91]That's weird funny.
[45:17.78]Uh, nothing over there.
[45:22.21]Can I break this?
[45:25.59]I think it was just to get these items.
[45:29.80]Somebody's banging.
[45:30.86]Who's banging?
[45:34.09]Who's banging?
[45:35.55]Somebody's banging on the wall.
[45:46.59]What?
[45:46.97]Okay, should I actually hurt this?
[45:51.48]That looks like a crazy room.
[46:00.13]This is a boss.
[46:01.93]Right?
[46:02.35]Hold on, I'm recharging.
[46:16.88]Okay.
[46:17.60]If I increase the maximum stacks by... Ooh!
[46:22.23]Initially, you can only have one stack of Skyborne Might.
[46:24.33]By unlocking Skyborne nodes with Red Mercury, you can increase it.
[46:27.64]I was going to say, there's probably a way to do it.
[46:31.30]Cool.
[46:31.72]Alright.
[46:33.30]Alright, so now... Ah!
[46:37.35]Alright, now I have another charge.
[46:42.29]And I should have four, right?
[46:43.68]I gotta rest.
[46:44.14]Rest.
[46:51.09]This is definitely the first boss.
[46:52.05]That guy in there is going to get smushed on by like a giant bro or something.
[46:57.76]He really does go ooh and ah.
[47:01.67]Um?
[47:02.83]I know.
[47:04.17]This is a boss arena.
[47:05.01]Look at this.
[47:05.77]Oh, shit.
[47:10.62]That hurt so much.
[47:25.93]Red Mercury?
[47:27.27]No, I guess not.
[47:30.84]Ooooooh.
[47:31.72]No, I say ooh and ahh.
[47:33.08]I can't help it.
[47:37.77]Uh oh.
[47:42.65]It's one of my more egregious filler words, I will agree with you.
[47:55.35]lost remains used for the mana potency node in the repository alright that's good too that's more actual healing I'm gonna run back and get that done
[48:25.99]Damn.
[48:29.78]That actually scared me a little.
[48:35.80]He's got me!
[48:37.57]I'm almost dead.
[48:40.35]He's got me!
[48:41.95]He's got me!
[48:48.72]Sometimes I feel like when I stream and play games, I'm narrating an audiobook.
[48:52.27]I have to describe to you what you are seeing.
[48:56.62]He's got me!
[48:58.34]As the zombie bit into her neck and drew the blood.
[49:02.53]I gotta get out of here!
[49:04.63]She screamed as she ran out.
[49:05.95]I feel like I'm narrating an audiobook.
[49:13.10]Hey, but if you have the screen, what if you're in a different tab?
[49:16.67]That's perfect.
[49:18.37]If you're in a different tab, then you get to know what's happening.
[49:27.42]Let me go do this.
[49:35.15]This is flask recovery amount.
[49:44.48]Cool.
[49:44.84]I could do the weapon mastery thing, right?
[49:50.93]Axe mastery 1.
[49:54.04]Yep.
[49:54.14]Yep.
[50:09.08]I'm getting probably close to a encounter up here.
[50:12.37]Or I don't know.
[50:13.15]I just kind of went... I just kind of walked in a random direction and I've been kind of going that way ever since.
[50:20.18]For like the last 45 minutes.
[50:22.80]There was that little mini boss.
[50:23.78]That was cool.
[50:31.76]You have to kill the birds?
[50:34.60]Do I?
[50:35.16]Are you trolling me?
[50:39.00]Oh, you do.
[50:47.25]You get these Aurum feathers.
[50:48.73]Okay.
[50:52.21]I like how I have more than one charge now.
[50:56.48]I'm just going straight up.
[51:01.74]Why am I twinkling?
[51:04.95]My arm is interacting with the environment here.
[51:13.80]Uh-oh.
[51:15.60]Charged heavy attacks.
[51:16.52]Relentlessly attacking or charging up heavy attacks and striking small to... Yeah, okay.
[51:19.91]So this is... It wants me to obliterate.
[51:21.21]Alright, this is definitely a boss coming up.
[51:23.50]100%.
[51:23.86]Alright, I'm ready.
[51:25.12]First try.
[51:27.74]Day two.
[51:28.06]No food remains.
[51:28.77]It's time to lock the gates and keep the last of the meat from escaping.
[51:33.40]Day 10.
[51:34.41]Her tears never cease.
[51:35.39]Is she afraid of the people of worship's rise will come for her?
[51:39.13]Fear not.
[51:39.69]I keep the key close.
[51:41.53]Only over my dead body will anyone set foot in Lightzen Temple.
[51:47.56]Uh-oh.
[51:47.70]Bold and bold.
[51:53.21]So that's how you upgrade the actual weapon.
[51:57.29]That's interesting.
[51:58.23]That wasn't necessarily in a blacksmith.
[52:00.29]It was just in the menu.
[52:02.32]Okay.
[52:04.12]Cool.
[52:05.18]Do I keep this on?
[52:08.02]Oh, this one's weird.
[52:08.78]This one's like... How's it look?
[52:17.93]Ready to get the better lighting?
[52:21.27]Ooh, okay.
[52:23.70]What's the bowl do?
[52:27.80]Hand over to Wu-Gang to gain access to... Ah!
[52:31.38]I'm doing that first.
[52:33.36]Oh!
[52:34.84]Ooh!
[52:36.38]Alright.
[52:37.43]For every ooh and ah, I... I have... There has to be a punishment for this.
[52:51.70]Those temple fools keep sniffing around for my treasure.
[52:56.42]Can I give it to him?
[52:58.47]Those temple fools keep sniffing around for my treasure.
[53:09.10]And over to Wu-Gang to gain access to new... Maybe it's after.
[53:16.67]Okay.
[53:17.77]I'm ready.
[53:19.66]Alright, let me first try this boss real quick.
[53:28.53]Alright, I'm going to take a sip of my coffee.
[53:29.65]I've got to lock in.
[53:33.60]I'm totally locking in for this.
[53:37.50]I don't want to hear any... I don't want to see or hear any bullshit in the chat, okay?
[53:44.67]I'm going to be quiet.
[53:45.90]Here we go.
[54:05.32]...
[54:05.57]This is going to be hard.
[54:27.02]Alright, let's go.
[54:47.82]Not bad.
[54:54.53]He's got wind moves.
[55:09.83]Shit!
[55:10.41]This guy got so greedy there for no reason.
[55:21.61]What do you got here?
[55:22.81]When he puts his staff down?
[55:27.26]Shit, I was so late on that.
[55:39.77]No, he's gonna do it!
[55:57.21]Don't get greedy.
[55:57.77]Don't get greedy.
[55:58.63]I keep getting greedy and it's stupid.
[56:06.20]Um, okay.
[56:06.58]That was awesome.
[56:25.35]Oh, the double dodge.
[56:26.39]Alright.
[56:31.77]Oh, he's got new moves.
[56:42.44]Oh shit, he's got fire.
[56:47.39]Oh, that was fucking cool.
[56:50.69]Oh shit.
[56:57.28]Magic is so good in this game.
[57:24.93]Don't, I gotta follow, no follow ups.
[57:26.91]Wait till he does this.
[57:52.88]Oh, he's doing the fire again.
[57:57.65]I gotta jump over it?
[58:34.89]Woo!
[58:43.86]Oh, don't kill me, please!
[58:57.86]This is it!
[59:02.43]Oh, fuck, don't!
[59:03.57]No!
[59:04.76]Please don't kill me!
[59:27.44]Oh my god, the choke is so real!
[59:29.09]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[59:29.99]I got hit him once.
[59:35.24]Don't laugh, please!
[59:37.76]I don't have any items!
[59:46.05]Oh my god, thank god, holy shit!
