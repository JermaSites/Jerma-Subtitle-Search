[00:34.11]What's going on?
[00:36.59]I've seen a lot of happy birthdays.
[00:38.45]Appreciate that.
[00:39.89]Happy birthday wishes.
[00:40.87]33!
[00:46.01]Feels good to be 33.
[00:47.27]I'm not almost 40.
[00:52.30]You know what I mean.
[00:57.54]So, today, I've got a few things to talk about.
[01:01.14]Let's go over some things.
[01:04.12]I might sound a little different.
[01:06.34]That's OK.
[01:08.90]I have changed setups.
[01:10.48]So you're not going to believe where I am right now.
[01:16.94]I could tell you where I am, but you wouldn't believe me, but I don't have the camera set up to prove what's going on.
[01:25.01]I am lying on the ground right now.
[01:27.93]Isn't that interesting?
[01:33.25]I got like a beanbag chair of like lying on the ground.
[01:36.78]I've got a set.
[01:37.68]I'm like lying down and playing today.
[01:40.40]This is gonna be awesome.
[01:42.86]This is gonna be so cool.
[01:44.56]I can't wait.
[01:48.78]Is he zonked?
[01:50.12]No.
[01:51.74]I am absolutely sober.
[01:54.72]But I'm going into full relaxation mode today.
[02:00.83]Can you show us?
[02:01.73]I'll probably set a camera up here.
[02:05.17]And then, I don't know if this is permanent.
[02:07.21]So, this could be pretty temporary.
[02:09.54]But, you know, I just felt like today, I'm like, you know what?
[02:12.78]I want to, like, lie down and just... Well, I'm not lying on my back, let's be really honest and clear here.
[02:18.56]I'm sitting up, but I'm sitting in, like, a beanbag chair.
[02:21.33]It's not a beanbag chair.
[02:22.37]I keep making that up.
[02:25.23]But I am reclined.
[02:32.90]He's in a hospital bed.
[02:33.94]I'm really retired.
[02:38.56]Yeah, I'm screaming from the, you know, from retirement home.
[02:44.66]Don't fall asleep.
[02:46.48]Now, if anything, this is going to be, I feel like this is going to be better to stream from.
[02:52.29]I could just sit back now.
[02:54.23]Alright, let's do real talk for a second.
[02:57.72]I actually have a lot of trouble, which I've been realizing lately, the last, like, I want to say two or three years.
[03:02.78]I know it has a lot to do with the chest and back problem.
[03:06.86]But sitting up, does anybody else hate sitting up in a chair?
[03:12.64]Sitting straight up with, like, my arms up, it causes a lot of pain.
[03:18.04]Especially nowadays.
[03:18.84]So I was like, you know what, I'm going to try it.
[03:21.32]I'm going to try just lying down.
[03:22.84]Like, sitting down, sitting back, reclining.
[03:25.83]This is a trial run.
[03:26.43]Let's see how it goes.
[03:28.74]Yep, it's gonna be back.
[03:32.24]You gonna play CS2?
[03:33.86]I don't think so.
[03:39.49]It's way better.
[03:42.27]Well, if you're sitting up, you want your posture to be good.
[03:45.83]But if you're leaning back a little, can you put my knees up?
[03:51.56]I bet you in an hour I talk about how much I hate this.
[03:57.78]I'm going to be leaning back like this and I'm just going to be like, I hate this.
[04:00.68]Alright, give me one second.
[04:05.65]I just want to grab a drink.
[04:06.43]Be right back.
[05:33.55]Okay, I got my drink.
[05:38.31]So, is this game any good?
[05:40.67]I saw this game being played and it looked really fun.
[05:43.51]Is it fun?
[05:44.65]Looks good.
[05:45.01]What are you drinking?
[05:49.59]Something really weird.
[05:52.70]It's a sun-kissed berry lemonade.
[05:58.64]We're going full recline streamer mode now.
[06:03.72]It's alright, it's pretty good.
[06:09.92]Going complete food mode.
[06:11.22]Alright, so let's go.
[06:16.59]OK.
[06:16.69]Alright, so what's the best character?
[06:20.31]Who should I play as?
[06:20.81]Do they have stats or is it just characters?
[06:29.15]What about Resident Evil 4 DLC?
[06:29.99]Oh yeah, 100%.
[06:30.37]Maybe not today.
[06:36.34]Do the otter?
[06:37.12]I just burped wicked loud.
[06:41.56]I really am retired.
[06:42.42]Did that come through the mic?
[06:46.97]It was like... Do otter?
[06:52.47]They're all really cute.
[06:53.29]They are.
[06:56.35]I'm gonna go... No, no, no.
[07:02.75]Ooh.
[07:06.01]Ooh.
[07:08.06]I mean, you could be royalty-free Garfield.
[07:13.83]Should I be royalty-free Garfield?
[07:16.43]Or... Moonmoon, okay.
[07:21.73]Alright, we're gonna go with Lloyd.
[07:26.95]Do I have this stuff?
[07:35.71]No, I don't.
[07:36.55]Alright, we'll go Lloyd.
[07:39.66]So now we just do quick match, right?
[07:41.24]Is that how this works?
[07:44.80]You should do Dark Lloyd.
[07:45.78]I could do Dark Lloyd.
[07:50.27]Oh, I don't have enough money.
[07:51.13]Okay, well, let's go.
[07:59.39]Do the tutorial.
[08:00.09]Alright, time to play.
[08:07.47]Do you dye your hair still?
[08:09.13]It's completely natural.
[08:10.21]Okay.
[08:10.43]Left and right.
[08:11.01]Okay.
[08:11.17]Let's go.
[08:25.91]It's pretty sloppy.
[08:26.57]Okay, there's the stamina bar.
[08:27.37]I'm like choking myself.
[08:28.25]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:30.65]Okay, so run up and... Wait, what did I miss?
[08:34.00]Easy.
[08:34.28]Alright.
[08:53.52]You can grab everything in the game.
[08:55.88]Pick up the green cube thing.
[08:58.40]Oh, I like lying down and streaming.
[09:00.24]This is awesome.
[09:00.86]I'm starting a new trend.
[09:01.86]Calling it right now.
[09:02.42]Right here.
[09:03.02]Easy.
[09:03.20]This is maximum chill.
[09:03.80]That's right.
[09:04.10]Did I not get it?
[09:20.76]Dude, you didn't invent lying down.
[09:23.04]But I invented lying down and screaming at the same time.
[09:26.55]No, I didn't.
[09:27.61]Okay, alright, alright.
[09:28.57]What do I do?
[09:31.61]Hold X to charge.
[09:32.57]And then release.
[09:37.16]And that didn't really work.
[09:51.17]What do you think invented means?
[09:52.31]Uh, you are the first person to do something.
[09:56.57]You invented it and then you patented it.
[09:58.43]See, the problem is I didn't patent this yet.
[09:59.89]That's what I need to do.
[10:08.42]OK.
[10:11.58]Close enough, yeah.
[10:13.33]Punch?
[10:13.55]Yeah, well there's a punch in the game.
[10:15.91]It automatically just got a full letter grade.
[10:17.41]Headbutt?
[10:17.65]B?
[10:17.69]Where's Lloyd?
[10:18.05]Ah, this is the tutorial.
[10:18.73]I don't think Lloyd is in the tutorial.
[10:39.27]Oops.
[10:40.01]Sorry.
[10:40.77]Forgot to mention.
[10:42.09]You can get knocked out by your own attacks from time to time.
[10:45.95]I won't forget again.
[10:46.85]It'll be a 10 if there are cars in this game.
[10:48.39]If there are cars in the game, it's 10.
[10:50.11]It's a 10.0.
[10:53.83]While running?
[10:54.40]Okay.
[10:55.60]Press X while running.
[10:58.72]Oh, you mean like this.
[11:02.70]Jump and kick.
[11:04.24]Drop kick.
[11:06.88]I feel like this is like a toddler having a tantrum.
[11:09.79]Those are tantrum arms.
[11:11.17]Okay, jump.
[11:13.93]Wait.

[11:53.95]Like this?
[11:54.85]This is like this, okay.
[11:55.77]Oh, I'm going to bash somebody's head in with this thing.

[20:14.88]He's holding my head under the water.
[20:16.34]That's illegal.
[20:19.10]You can't do that.
[20:19.86]That's illegal.
[20:24.19]Oh boy.

[20:46.23]Should you always go for like running kicks or what?
[20:49.33]Baseball bat, give it to me.
[20:50.91]No, what am I doing?
[20:52.51]Just get up there now.

[21:14.67]What just happened?
[21:20.96]Oh!

[21:28.13]Did I spend all my coins?
[21:36.52]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[21:41.18]I'm going to throw a coin at this guy.
[21:45.70]Oh, I just missed.
[21:52.61]Oh, they're in trouble now.
[21:56.40]Okay, here we go.
[21:56.96]Ready?
[21:59.90]That's not where I just aimed.
[22:01.78]Why did it go all the way up here?
[22:03.38]My crosshair was right here.
[22:08.73]Garfield's on your team.
[22:10.13]Oh, whoops.
[22:15.65]Here we go.
[22:16.55]Nice.
[22:17.35]Very, very nice.
[22:19.92]Ah, shit.
[22:21.96]Garfield's got it.
[22:29.79]Don't let him take you in there.
[22:45.60]Right in the face.
[22:47.90]I don't want to throw this.
[22:48.68]I'm afraid I'll hurt him.
[22:52.87]Dude, that was like a sniper.
[22:55.25]Oh never mind.
[22:58.27]Damn it, I'm so bad at this.
[23:09.42]Take the shot.
[23:11.00]That was really close though, you have to admit.
[23:12.58]Where are they?
[23:17.82]Alright, did we win?
[23:22.32]Alright, no.
[23:23.08]Alright, let's go.
[23:24.61]Okay, okay.
[23:25.29]I'm ready, ready.
[23:25.95]Garfield, we're gonna get this right now.
[23:28.45]Check this out.
[23:30.07]I got a gun now.
[23:37.19]Pick it up with both hands.
[23:40.49]Whacking people.
[23:48.70]Get over here.
[23:49.46]Or at least I scared him.
[23:56.04]I was just walked into the fucking like.
[23:58.50]Hold on.
[24:02.75]Oh.
[24:05.01]How do I pick him up?
[24:11.96]How do you pick people up?
[24:14.35]How do you pick people?
[24:15.15]How do I let go of the bat?
[24:16.41]Isn't it right?
[24:17.05]Oh, it's double tap right trigger.
[24:19.65]That's why I was just tapping right trigger.
[24:26.93]Just get up.
[24:27.31]I'm going up right now.
[24:33.37]Forget about anything else.
[24:37.29]Yeah, this is all that matters.
[24:38.53]It's just whoever's at the highest point.
[24:40.49]So who cares?
[24:41.33]I'm just going to stand at the very top of this thing.
[24:47.43]Why would you do anything else?

[26:37.80]I don't know, it's a goofy cartoon game.
[26:47.72]As long as, I'm doing the same strat I did last time.
[26:51.48]Seriously.
[27:00.27]Why is he going so slow?
[27:06.16]He's so... Why did I do that?
[27:13.91]No, don't even think about it.
[27:23.45]What?
[27:23.79]Did you just throw it to me?
[27:25.00]And I pick... What?
[27:26.64]I caught it.
[27:27.98]Put it down.
[27:28.60]Why did I pick... I caught it out of the air.
[27:30.32]I didn't mean to do that.
[27:41.46]I think it just ran into the pole.
[27:44.20]Oh my God, what am I doing?
[27:46.12]Why did I do that?
[27:49.94]Honestly, if as long as blue doesn't win, that was bad.
[27:55.48]Oh, that's not good.
[27:56.26]That's very bad.
[28:01.90]Well, as long as blue doesn't win, we're good.
[28:13.56]Alright, I gotta help.
[28:18.96]Hey, we did it.
[28:19.54]Nice.
[28:19.76]Is that worth something?
[28:25.68]Nice job, Garfield.
[28:26.95]You did it.
[28:27.41]I don't know why.
[28:36.61]I don't know.
[28:37.23]That character had a punchable face.
[28:41.39]That character had a punchable face.
[28:42.45]By the way,
[28:45.03]What is up with that?
[28:45.69]Have you guys ever noticed that, like... Oh, yeah, that guy has a wicked punchable face.
[28:52.44]Why is, like, your first impression of somebody to physically assault them?
[29:01.56]What's up with that?
[29:02.42]Oh, it took a picture.
[29:08.17]I see.
[29:11.27]Your face is punchable.
[29:14.43]But you know what I mean?
[29:14.93]Like, oh, yeah, yeah, I got a wicked punchable face.
[29:19.17]You're already like having a fantasy of beating this person up.
[29:22.76]You don't even know who this person is.
[29:35.54]You just said it, though.
[29:36.18]I was setting up the joke.
[29:41.19]I wanted to bring that up like two weeks ago.
[29:51.14]Alright, what's the fun one?
[29:53.83]Winter is... Oh, well, I guess we don't even have a choice.
[30:08.79]Is anybody, is people saying play with other people?
[30:10.55]Is that, I know this is like a multiplayer game and everything, but I kind of just want to try it.
[30:14.91]I don't know how long I'm going to play this game for.
[30:18.75]So I don't, I mean, I know I might be here for playing this game for like an hour or two or three, but I don't know if I want to be like, hey, everybody, let's do it.
[30:26.88]And then like 20 minutes later, I'm like, yeah, I'm kind of done.
[30:28.96]Alright.
[30:33.50]This is really fun though.
[30:34.14]I like it.
[30:45.16]Alright, so we just have to stay alive.
[30:47.18]No, wait, wait.
[30:54.25]Oh, it's not stay alive.
[30:55.57]It's okay.
[30:56.81]I was being it.
[30:57.31]Okay.
[30:57.49]It's not stay alive.
[30:59.53]It's I didn't pay attention at all.
[31:02.25]Alright.
[31:02.49]So you have to score a guy in a circle.
[31:07.08]Sorry.
[31:08.34]Alright.
[31:08.56]I get it now.
[31:09.18]It's the first time I've played it.
[31:10.08]I'm going to go.
[31:10.82]Don't wait.
[31:11.28]You never be the first person that runs for the dodgeball.
[31:19.93]Alright, that's fine.
[31:21.41]What goal is ours?
[31:22.35]Because that's incredibly embarrassing if I don't do it the right way.
[31:29.06]What goal is ours?
[31:31.48]What team am I on?
[31:48.75]Blue team.
[31:49.21]Alright, good.
[31:54.32]Oh, right.
[31:54.70]It's right up over our heads.
[31:55.48]Okay, so we want to score on that goal in front of us.
[32:06.25]I'm really upset that Garfield's not there.
[32:09.65]It's okay.
[32:14.34]Yeah, the whole time that it was explaining, I was looking over here talking about the punchable face thing.
[32:18.60]I wasn't even looking.
[32:23.70]I'm scoring a goal.
[32:27.89]Get off me.
[32:31.03]How long do you stay down for?
[32:32.25]Alright, I'm good.
[32:40.34]I got it.
[32:40.62]I got it.
[32:40.90]I got the ball.
[32:41.28]I got the ball.
[32:41.66]I got the ball.
[32:42.10]I got the ball.
[32:42.52]I got the ball.
[32:43.77]I got the ball!
[32:53.65]Shit, I tried to dropkick.
[33:04.04]I like the gorilla.
[33:04.90]The gorilla's cool.
[33:07.62]You can move the camera.
[33:08.76]Oh shit.
[33:09.62]Right stick I guess, yeah.
[33:16.42]I just tried to do the same thing and I got hit.
[33:21.10]Really?
[33:22.38]We just got annihilated.
[33:24.64]Is it actually five to nothing?
[33:27.21]What is happening right now?
[33:36.21]I'm going, I'm jumping in and drop kicking immediately.
[33:37.86]I'm going to do the same thing they just did to me.
[33:40.70]I pressed B instead of A. Let go of me.
[33:46.49]How do you get somebody to let go of you?
[33:54.94]What?
[33:56.12]Okay.
[33:58.10]How do I stop this guy from doing this?
[34:03.28]Somebody help.
[34:06.58]Good, good, good, good.
[34:07.74]Clear shot, clear shot.
[34:08.94]Yes.
[34:09.94]We got one goal.
[34:22.86]They disconnected.
[34:25.00]Did they?
[34:30.83]Do not.
[34:34.55]Oh my God, how?
[34:35.87]Alright.
[34:37.73]That one needs a little more practice.
[34:45.63]This gorilla scored, I think, all of their gold.
[35:00.82]I want to be right in the middle.
[35:08.41]What the hell?
[35:13.79]Is he biting me?
[35:14.47]He's biting me.
[35:22.11]Did you see Destiny 2's DLC?
[35:23.25]Um...
[35:29.64]No Alright, alright, let's go You like frosty flake yeah frosted flakes, but it was too long of a name so I had to make I had to get rid of the E and D The name was too long
[35:48.83]What about sorcery?
[35:50.19]We'll go back to sorcery probably in this coming week.
[35:52.57]Next week, maybe.
[35:53.09]Alright, I want to do beat up bridge 100%.
[35:55.42]That looks like the absolute best one.
[35:58.42]Stay on the bridge and stay alive.
[36:00.44]You got it.
[36:16.70]I think the problem was I wanted to be the goose and I was playing as the duck.
[36:23.42]I think that was the mistake.
[36:29.21]Your shoutout for frozen red grapes literally changed my life.
[36:32.03]Thank you.
[36:32.59]Honest to God.
[36:34.55]I'm glad to hear that.
[36:39.62]I'm seeing a lot of sames right now.
[36:41.12]I'm seeing a lot of sames.
[36:41.84]That's great.
[36:45.37]They hurt my teeth.
[36:47.06]Alright, let me give you a little bit of a tip.
[36:51.20]This is very important.
[36:52.18]A lot of people that do frozen grapes, they fuck the whole thing up.
[36:54.46]So listen closely.
[36:55.26]Okay?
[36:58.14]The grapes, they need to be in the freezer for at least a whole day.
[37:05.97]This takes a whole day.
[37:07.11]It takes like six plus hours to get... They need to be frozen solid.
[37:11.11]Frozen solid.
[37:12.45]Take them out.
[37:13.89]And then once they're out, you... I lost.
[37:17.07]Um, that was... Okay.
[37:18.97]Uh, anyways.
[37:19.49]So... What were we talking about?
[37:22.44]Okay, frozen grapes.
[37:23.50]Did I actually just lose?
[37:29.59]OK, so put them in the freezer for at least six to eight hours if you frozen solid.
[37:35.73]When you take them out of the freezer, don't just eat them right away.
[37:38.51]I know it's like, oh, here they are, frozen grapes.
[37:41.69]Let them sit out for 15 to 20 minutes, maybe like 10 minutes.
[37:46.69]They'll be a little bit softer, but still frozen and chewy on the inside.
[37:50.30]It is the greatest snack ever invented.
[37:54.28]I invented it.
[37:54.84]I just want to make sure that you all can attribute it to me.
[38:03.80]Did I miss the bomb?
[38:08.38]Yeah, you invented it.
[38:13.15]Also, somebody said frozen blueberries.
[38:15.51]And I said, oh, intriguing.
[38:17.43]I had them.
[38:18.33]They're wonderful.
[38:22.62]Why the fuck did I just do that?
[38:24.34]Okay.
[38:36.68]Yeah, I will reiterate this one more time.
[38:42.44]Regular grapes, they're not as good to me.
[38:47.35]And the thought of eating a handful of grapes is like, that's okay.
[38:52.47]I cannot get enough of these frozen grapes.
[38:54.35]I can't get enough of them.
[38:56.16]I have, let me tell you something.
[38:58.92]I've been to the grocery store.
[39:02.03]three different times to get another big container of grapes the last time before this that I got a container of grapes I didn't even eat half of them I don't think and it's like ah shit I don't like doing that right so you buy like the smaller container to make sure I'm buying the big ass container and I'm freezing them all and I'm eating the whole fucking thing not in one sitting obviously but
[39:33.96]Alright, I can do some headbutts.
[39:39.98]Wait, that's not a bad idea.
[39:41.34]Get away from the bomb!
[39:53.81]He's trying to put it in my mouth!
[39:57.39]Why are there so many of these?
[40:05.29]Holy shit, I just did it and I was unconscious when it happened.
[40:07.79]Cool, we did it.
[40:21.20]Did I get him?
[40:24.35]No, get off me.
[40:25.71]Thank you so much, you just saved my life.
[40:35.42]Not good.
[40:42.46]Oh my god.
[40:43.78]Come on.
[40:47.41]Why?
[40:49.77]I just went flying.
[40:52.51]It'll hit somebody.
[40:53.13]Whatever.
[41:01.92]I just dumped my entire drink on me.
[41:04.83]Yeah, frozen blueberries are awesome, but frozen grapes?
[41:09.19]Oh my goodness, it just changes everything.
[41:14.30]And speaking of somebody that actually finds it kind of difficult to put fruits into his diet?
[41:21.48]I can do vegetables, right?
[41:22.65]But there's something about a fruit, like eating an orange or an apple.
[41:27.25]Or, yeah, I'm going to eat a bunch of melon today.
[41:30.29]That kind of just doesn't happen.
[41:32.37]This thing is vertical.
[41:36.31]Bananas are great.
[41:37.77]I like to blend bananas in a smoothie, but if you're having trouble getting fruits in your diet, there's no jokes around.
[41:45.47]It's a great way to do it.
[41:46.15]Damn it.
[41:57.26]You should talk about tuna fish again.
[41:58.68]OK, so.
[42:05.32]What about the Silent Hill 2 remake?
[42:07.80]Is it out?
[42:12.40]Jeremy, you're not even playing the game.
[42:16.06]I was playing.
[42:18.08]Watch this.
[42:21.40]I just, he tripped on it.
[42:29.31]You should try eating a cold orange in the shower.
[42:39.32]I've had a can of Coke in the shower and that was kind of cool.
[42:45.74]It's been a very long time.
[42:50.26]I've had a freezing cold, like a really ice cold can of Coke.
[42:54.88]There's something about it.
[42:55.64]I don't know.
[42:56.34]I don't recommend you do this.
[42:59.42]But I remember just slurping it down and I didn't even care if it got all over me.
[43:02.28]I didn't even care.
[43:02.80]It was like, oh yeah, it's like I'm going to slam this.
[43:18.21]I want to pick up the right way.
[43:19.81]No, you know, I didn't pick it up the right way.
[43:24.91]Why didn't I do that?
[43:27.43]How come I didn't use his other hand?
[43:38.90]Yep, OK, see ya.
[43:42.12]Wow, the tables have turned.
[44:18.56]put that down that's one holy shit we did it that's another win that's a that's a w right there you can call it a cleanup job if you want but that was still hold on I just spilled this shit I'm an idiot

[44:45.60]I don't care.
[44:52.12]Play this with Vinny.
[44:59.47]Thank you so much.
[45:02.11]She's rescuing me.
[45:08.83]Yeah, I got it.
[45:09.19]It's good.
[45:12.65]It's just in my... It's just on my hand.
[45:15.88]I gotta get used to that.
[45:17.38]I'm a reclined streamer now.
[45:28.39]Gator Valley.
[45:30.53]Do this one.
[45:34.07]Show us the setup.
[45:37.56]Uh...
[45:39.71]I didn't really have time to put the webcam in, but you'll see it.
[45:44.09]And you're all going to think I'm out of my fucking mind, but it's alright because I'm comfortable here and who cares?
[45:53.00]People, uh, yeah, my stream setup.
[45:55.14]I've got all these, like, lights, and I've got, like, a green screen, and I've got, like, stuff.
[45:59.68]I have, like, that Reddit shelf.
[46:01.16]Right.
[46:01.42]Like, oh, I'm gonna put stuff on it.
[46:03.32]I'm, uh, everything's on the ground right now.
[46:04.98]I'm literally on the ground.
[46:07.00]And I kinda like it here.
[46:08.26]I kinda like it just sitting here against, like, with a beanbag chair that's not a beanbag chair.
[46:14.59]I don't even, I don't even care.
[46:16.11]It's fun.
[46:16.61]I like it.
[46:21.07]Uh...
[46:23.46]I'm going to stay with the goose.
[46:30.09]There's nothing quite like being on the floor streamer, yeah?
[46:33.79]And God damn it, I wasn't even looking.
[46:35.25]Alright, I think we're teams, right?
[46:39.76]Yeah.
[46:42.00]It's like a candy factory.
[46:44.88]Cool, we eat the candy.
[46:58.17]Oh.
[47:02.77]Wait, are we taking the... I didn't pay any attention.
[47:05.78]Are we taking the candy back to our base?
[47:10.20]In one sentence, what's the goal?
[47:16.12]Steal the candy.
[47:16.82]Okay.
[47:40.91]I'm just going to be the muscle.
[47:53.92]Ooh, that was a big one.
[47:55.04]Alright, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[47:58.86]I am clobbering this dude.
[48:05.76]Oh my God, I killed him.
[48:18.51]Alright, it's only us here.
[48:20.85]We should be fine.
[48:37.17]Are we winning?
[49:02.18]I helped quite a bit, actually.
[49:11.84]That was... I helped quite a bit.
[49:16.06]Where am I?
[49:20.70]Damn it.
[49:23.56]I got an egg coin?
[49:24.64]Cool.
[49:31.04]The rabbits are holding hands, are they?
[49:36.84]Kind of remarkable they actually could go up there.
[49:41.73]Is gambling.
[49:43.71]Really OK?
[49:48.51]Don't tell him about that while it's too late.
[49:51.29]Already did.
[49:54.29]Oh man, this one looks kind of crazy.
[50:01.99]Frozen grapes are great, but if you... Hold on, let me see what you said.
[50:05.22]Combine them with whipped cream?
[50:06.52]Hold on.
[50:08.40]I need to know that strat.
[50:10.04]Looks like somebody has a frozen grape strategy.
[50:11.78]Have you tried... carbonating them in a whipped cream dispenser?
[50:20.92]Huh?
[50:23.42]Carbonated grapes?
[50:27.10]I don't even know what that means, but it sounds kind of intriguing.
[50:32.07]You mean like you mash them up and whip them up with, and then you put them in like heavy cream and put them in a dispenser?
[50:38.42]That actually sounds kind of cool.
[50:39.80]You can do that with like any kind of fruit, right?
[50:42.78]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[50:47.80]That was, I hope that was not a teammate.
[50:49.86]I don't, it might have been.
[50:56.69]Ooh!
[50:58.51]Get out of here.
[51:00.53]Get out of here.
[51:02.49]No.
[51:09.05]I freaked out.
[51:10.51]Oh, that was a victory right there.
[51:12.35]I freaked out.
[51:13.07]We still won.
[51:13.61]Oh, I didn't.
[51:21.49]Oh, that hurt a lot.
[51:27.09]What if I just stay on the ground?
[51:27.91]Will anyone come get me?
[51:36.92]Who has the electricity?
[51:38.00]Don't ever give me a weapon.
[52:01.06]I'm going to stand over here.
[52:03.94]Is there a taunt button?
[52:04.88]I hope there is.
[52:05.40]Uh-oh.
[52:07.98]What is going on?
[52:08.92]Get off me!
[52:17.30]This taser is... Oh, whatever.
[52:20.26]What was that?
[52:28.65]Can I have some?
[52:38.29]Pick him up.
[52:39.09]Pick him up!
[52:40.77]Oh my god.
[52:43.01]You have to be fucking kidding me.
[52:45.33]I'm trying to grab him and he just holds on with one hand like he's... Has a fucking little kid's wagon behind him.
[53:08.02]A whole wagon?
[53:10.64]Like those little kid wagons that they drag?
[53:13.52]Alright, let's stay back here together.
[53:25.11]Oh my... I think I'm not very good at this.
[53:32.77]I went for a super move and it didn't do anything.
[53:36.17]Oh man.
[53:39.25]Oh man.
[53:40.13]I just wanted to punch that guy in the face so bad.
[53:47.62]There was so much power in that punch.
[53:53.63]If it hit anybody.
[53:55.11]It would have gotten annihilated.
[54:07.88]This is getting intense, though.
[54:09.18]Ooh, big kick.
[54:15.64]Wow.
[54:16.00]Okay, we got a 10 out of 10 cameraman here.
[54:19.50]Saw the whole thing.
[54:25.68]This is a formal request for you to play Baldur's Gate.
[54:30.13]Holly and I have actually been playing it off-screen.
[54:32.97]Not a whole lot, though.
[54:34.97]Where am I?
[54:37.52]Just barely got into it.
[54:44.89]Oh, hold on.
[54:45.17]Actually, let me go see the other stuff.
[54:46.33]I can do... I have money now, right?
[54:48.73]I have, like, coins or something?
[54:57.94]Okay, level up.
[55:00.78]I got 1500 cookies.
[55:06.36]A bacon avatar.
[55:07.57]Okay.
[55:10.15]Cool.
[55:13.67]So where are these eggs?
[55:20.80]How do you like it so far?
[55:22.46]It's really, really, really cool.
[55:26.10]I like that...
[55:28.16]It's kind of, you just can sort of go wherever you want, really.
[55:31.24]There's that, you know, there's a ton of main mission storyline stuff.
[55:37.11]But you can kind of just walk in a direction and just kind of do whatever you want.
[55:47.03]Okay, uh, surprise eggs.
[55:50.21]How many do I have?
[55:50.75]One?
[55:51.19]Okay, I can do one egg.
[55:54.85]Let's go.
[55:55.57]Is it worth doing it like this?
[55:56.57]I think this, no, that's in-game currency.
[55:59.61]Alright, what do we get?
[56:04.50]Character, I'm playing a... a gnome sorcerer.
[56:10.60]Focusing on lightning.
[56:16.18]Pink hammer.
[56:17.12]Ooh, okay.
[56:18.49]Let's try it.
[56:30.39]Laughing my ass off, that's you.
[56:36.58]Is it?
[56:43.24]Of course, it's always Sorcery.
[56:46.88]Well, Sorcery is one of my favorite games of all time.
[56:53.20]I'm gonna compare it to Sorcery.
[57:04.25]No, I don't want to do this one again.
[57:05.21]This one was too hard.
[57:15.91]Can you review the game immediately?
[57:18.21]That might take a long time.
[57:20.55]I have a feeling that's going to take a little bit.
[57:26.92]I feel like I've seen the amount of the game that amounts to the first preview.
[57:33.98]At the movie theater.
[57:37.46]You're gonna have to give me a little bit.
[57:41.28]Oh my god, hell yeah.
[57:49.67]Did you win any F-Zero games?
[57:52.73]Holly and I have been obsessed with F-Zero 99.
[58:00.99]I've come in third place overall one time.
[58:05.38]I took a screenshot to prove it, just in case anyone didn't believe it.
[58:14.91]That's a lie?
[58:15.75]Well, no, it isn't.
[58:16.53]It's for real.
[58:20.68]But realistically, at this point, I can get into the top... Like top 15, top 20 very, very much consistently pretty much every time.
[58:39.70]I like this character a lot.
[58:47.52]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[58:48.08]You're way stronger.
[58:48.82]Why?
[58:54.19]Let me up.
[58:55.07]Pull me up.
[58:55.37]Pull me up.
[58:55.69]Pull me up.
[58:56.35]Come on.
[58:56.67]Up, up, up, up, up.
[58:57.23]Pull us up.
[58:57.59]Pull us up, dude.
[58:58.13]Come on.
[58:58.43]Pull us up.
[58:59.49]Pull us up, dude.
[59:00.07]Please pull us up.
[59:00.77]Oh, he's trying to let him go.
[59:12.40]But, uh, okay.
[59:13.74]It's alright.
[59:34.81]What the hell was that?
[59:41.83]Dude, he hit me in the hands and I shot the gun straight in the air.
[59:54.29]Yes!
[59:55.59]Wait.
[59:59.26]Yes!
[60:08.89]Do not get eliminated first.
[60:10.19]Come on.
[60:19.16]Thank you, whoever did that.
[60:20.66]Thank you.
[60:21.64]Actually, thank you very much.
[60:25.08]I'm a hammerhead.
[60:25.64]I should be hitting people with the head.
[60:35.00]Get out of here.
[60:37.94]Oh, I'm on your team.
[60:40.06]Hey, what are you doing?
[60:43.56]Why did you do that?
[60:45.20]Why?
[60:45.84]He just saw red.
[60:46.76]He just saw red.
[60:47.62]He didn't even know.
[60:48.36]I don't think he even knew.
[60:49.08]Alright, we're kind of just fucking this guy up.
[61:01.01]That was revenge.
[61:01.79]Did I shoot him before?
[61:03.03]No.
[61:04.51]revenge why are you saying wait really oh no that's not good alright I deserved it that's very ball dude I'm getting carried so hard you tased him but alright but here's the thing I didn't mean to
[61:32.95]He meant to punch me in the face and throw me off the ship.
[61:41.21]Rolled off.
[61:48.56]That's a cool skin or whatever it is.
[61:52.24]What kind of animal is that?
[61:53.24]I want to see.
[62:04.26]Sorry, as long as the blue doesn't win, we're good.
[62:07.74]Ori and the Blind Forest.
[62:09.28]Oh, okay.
[62:31.88]What are you doing?
[62:32.64]I made one mistake and you're going to eliminate me twice?
[62:36.30]What the hell?
[62:38.56]I tased you once and you're going to throw me off the ship two times?
[62:44.79]Come on, man.
[62:53.92]Bro is holding a grudge.
[62:55.60]Yeah.
[63:04.34]Well, I still, I want you to win because I get the win too.
[63:08.90]Ooh, almost.
[63:12.20]He hates you.
[63:14.73]He does.
[63:15.35]He hates me.
[63:19.41]I'm going to stay away from him.
[63:20.75]I'm going to stay on the other side of the map.
[63:23.27]Because he sees the hammerhead and he's like, I'm going to kill that guy.
[63:34.91]Good backflip.
[63:35.27]Give me that.
[63:40.99]Give me.
[63:41.33]Give me.
[63:48.78]Oops.
[63:53.22]Sorry, that was kind of loud.
[64:06.11]No, no, no, no.
[64:07.01]Get away, get away, get away, get away.
[64:11.59]See ya.
[64:12.17]Alright.
[64:13.12]I gotta clutch this up right now.
[64:22.08]What are you doing?
[64:23.06]Oh my god, I freaked out.
[64:24.35]What?
[64:24.59]I...
[64:28.06]I didn't... Okay, let me explain.
[64:29.46]Let me explain.
[64:30.94]Everyone listen for one second.
[64:32.97]I thought the ship was two or three... I thought it was longer.
[64:37.17]No, I want to get up there and get my picture taken.
[64:44.75]I can't.
[64:48.80]You're so bad.
[64:49.72]I thought the ship was a little bit longer.
[64:52.80]I was... That guy freaked me out.
[64:54.38]I thought he was going to get me.
[64:56.18]We still win.
[64:56.70]It's alright to win.
[65:00.84]You look like a mole rat.
[65:08.58]Why did you move?
[65:09.39]I don't know.
[65:14.77]What famous animal would you add to this game?
[65:16.85]An armadillo.
[65:18.19]It might even be in the game already.
[65:20.26]Oh, what is this one?
[65:33.38]Carry candies back to base to earn points.
[65:38.53]I'm going just straight up defense.
[65:42.27]Octopus.
[65:42.73]Octopus would be cool.
[65:43.67]Squid.
[65:44.03]Octopus.
[65:46.60]Is there a whale?
[65:48.60]Is there like a lobster or crab or something?
[65:52.02]That would be a great addition.
[66:01.85]Play Counter-Strike 2 in your off time.
[66:03.22]It's a great game.
[66:03.88]It's really fun.
[66:06.88]I haven't played the original Counter-Strike 1.6.
[66:09.72]I was terrible at it, but I played it.
[66:18.85]I tried CSGO.
[66:19.79]There's a video on my YouTube channel where I talk about like, oh yeah, man, gonna be playing a lot of CSGO.
[66:25.29]I think I played it one time and never played it ever again.
[66:29.21]I think there's a video of me playing it.
[66:32.04]And it's like, oh yeah, like it's a big deal.
[66:33.62]And I just, it just wasn't for me at all.
[66:39.08]People are too good at that game.
[66:39.97]Where's our base?
[66:44.15]Where do we turn this in?
[66:46.05]Oh, right here.
[66:46.37]You can't fall down that, can you?
[66:59.89]I'm going to start just transferring.
[67:10.62]Give me that.
[67:13.64]Alright, deposit those and we'll win.
[67:31.05]Did I help?
[67:37.23]Am I dead, dead?
[67:38.07]Am I dead, dead?
[67:41.45]I'm here, I'm good.
[67:41.95]Nice job, duck.
[67:50.12]Alright, we're doing alright.
[67:57.86]No shit, I'm sorry.
[68:02.12]Make sure you bring them all back.
[68:03.31]Come on, we gotta work together.
[68:11.19]Get out of here with that shit.
[68:17.98]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[68:19.14]Just take it back, take it back.
[68:21.87]Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[68:22.65]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[68:23.91]Up, up, up, up, up.
[68:24.53]We got it, we got it, we got it.
[68:37.59]Where are they going with that?
[68:39.39]I just stomped all over that guy's face.
[68:48.71]Don't let him drop it.
[68:49.81]Don't let him... Close this shit.
[68:57.32]No, don't open it again.
[68:58.40]Close it.
[68:58.74]Did I close it or did I open it?
[69:10.32]Give me this.
[69:14.86]Give me this.
[69:17.70]I'm gonna drop you into the fucking freezer.
[69:25.96]Damn it!
[69:33.36]We can hear you mashing buttons.
[69:34.70]You're gonna be like gripping the controller.
[69:46.93]Shit.
[69:48.14]This game is fun.
[69:48.74]I like it.
[70:08.73]Don't eat the controller.
[70:09.47]It's going to hurt to poop.
[70:13.71]What about Dark and Darker?
[70:14.53]Um, not in the immediate future.
[70:23.22]What about football?
[70:26.74]What is it?
[70:29.36]Stay away from the poison cloud and stay alive.
[70:31.82]Uh, I get it.
[70:36.84]Browser games?
[70:37.34]We'll do browser games the next time I stream.
[70:40.04]Or maybe I'll play the Resident Evil DLC.
[70:43.04]That sounds fun too.
[70:47.78]Resident Evil 4?
[70:52.20]I also have to finish Sorcery.
[71:07.24]He's just going to play Binding of Isaac for four hours?
[71:11.43]Based.
[71:17.53]Alright, stay out of the poison.
[71:23.30]I have a new strategy.
[71:29.84]It's called just stay on the ground.
[71:31.15]I'm just playing dead.
[71:39.95]Nobody pays attention, really.
[71:49.04]This is where I get up and throw you in.
[71:50.44]Oh, never mind.
[71:58.02]God damn it.
[72:00.58]How do I get out of here?
[72:06.68]Oh, shit.
[72:07.03]Alright.
[72:21.41]I had a choice.
[72:23.03]I knew that was going to blow up in half a second.
[72:26.35]I was trying to throw it at somebody.
[72:27.89]Just, you gotta try.
[72:29.11]You have to go for it.
[72:30.17]Otherwise, I would have blown right back.
[72:41.35]Yeah, but why?
[72:43.78]Okay, I was climbing up here.
[72:45.74]And there were three bombs here.
[72:47.28]I climbed up here.
[72:49.28]Boom.
[72:50.90]Blinking red.
[72:52.82]At some point, you have to just go for it.
[73:03.97]Your teammate is so good.
[73:05.93]Yeah, they're so good, in fact, that I'm on the menu too.
[73:12.72]As long as we win, I'll take the free eggs, whatever.
[73:15.44]Oh, I think we actually... No, he's dead.
[73:30.43]Oh, it gets closer.
[73:31.71]Oh, he shot him in the head.
[73:48.78]What the fuck?
[73:50.24]That guy's done that to me twice.
[73:53.52]Thank you so much.
[74:00.06]Damn it.
[74:01.08]I want those nunchucks.
[74:10.85]Why is this guy glowing?
[74:11.73]I don't know how to fix this.
[74:20.99]How do I fix this?
[74:21.63]Oh, okay.
[74:30.95]Give me.
[74:31.33]Give me.
[74:32.44]Hold it the right way.
[74:37.86]Oh, shoot.
[74:39.86]Sorry.
[74:41.24]I'm sorry.
[74:41.78]I did not mean to hit you in the head with that, but it just happened.
[74:46.57]Second I get a melee weapon, it's over for everybody.
[75:04.13]Damn it.
[75:13.13]Hold it the right way.
[75:23.48]Come on.
[75:26.92]No.
[75:31.69]Oh, come on.
[75:43.40]Dude, Miku's been waiting for birthday wishes for you from a month.
[75:47.78]I said happy birthday, Miku.
[75:48.95]You just weren't here.
[75:55.51]I said it.
[76:01.27]Yes, I did.
[76:09.47]Oh my god, this guy's gonna kill me.
[76:12.95]You can't see who did that, right?
[76:15.73]This person has no idea I did that.
[76:24.44]Should save the coins.
[76:26.58]Do they carry over?
[76:27.28]I imagine probably so.
[76:35.62]I'm going right for the boomerang.
[77:13.36]Fudge out, please!
[77:18.62]You- hit- hit!
[77:23.13]I have to get away from the guy with the frying pan.
[77:28.95]That was a risky move, but you know what?
[77:30.49]Fuck it.
[77:30.81]Put him in the face of the fucking cinder block.
[77:36.88]Who is- Dude.
[77:39.58]Wha- What?
[78:00.10]Watch out.
[78:14.00]We need some more teamwork.
[78:20.90]Just give it to me.
[78:22.26]Don't.
[78:25.71]This is such a bad place to be.
[78:29.61]Why am I still on the ground?
[78:30.83]Got it.
[78:49.74]No.
[78:53.90]I screamed a lot today.
[79:18.58]Okay, get the brick.
[79:22.70]How did I not hit you with the brick?
[79:41.07]I dropped on his head.
[79:41.77]I got him.
[79:43.73]He's not getting up for a long time.
[79:57.47]Oh, thank goodness we're all hurt.
[80:06.47]This guy just won't leave me alone.
[80:08.00]No, what?
[80:14.20]Wait, what just happened?
[80:17.44]All the gas was everywhere.
[80:30.73]Come on, we gotta get in the picture together.
[80:36.45]Come on.
[80:45.95]Right when the picture gets taken.
[80:53.83]Can't wait for Hylics 2?
[80:56.03]How long is Hylics 2?
[81:00.47]Because I know Hylics 1 was 4, if I remember.
[81:04.37]3 or 4.
[81:04.59]It's like 5 to 10.
[81:16.08]There's a lot of game modes.
[81:18.20]What is Wind Tunnel?
[81:21.77]Eh, we'll do this one.
[81:23.99]Beat the Hockey into opponent's gate to earn points.
[81:30.73]Beat the hockey into opponent's gate.
[81:36.71]Hockey puck?
[81:44.98]Trevor, can you do another sponsored stream?
[81:47.92]Alright!
[81:48.80]I mean, that's a request.
[81:50.96]That's a request.
[81:51.66]Somebody just requested one.
[81:54.62]One guy!
[81:55.08]One guy moment!
[81:55.70]You know what I mean?
[82:11.32]Somebody said, you make me sick.
[82:14.69]Oh, settle down.
[82:20.87]Industry plant.
[82:26.70]Alright, so we have to score goals?
[82:28.86]Oh, it's this thing.
[82:51.79]Is a whole team of gorillas?
[82:54.14]Oh, no, it's not.
[82:54.70]Oh, shit.
[83:03.08]Dude, I want to watch this version of hockey.
[83:16.72]Oh, I'm on your team.
[83:23.59]I got it.
[83:24.47]I got it now.
[83:27.74]I'm just gonna play defense.
[83:46.69]He's just holding his arm out and has his palm on the top of my head.
[83:50.57]And I am swinging while he holds me back.
[83:53.33]Can we just get a gold?
[84:03.90]Okay, let's go.
[84:14.61]Alright, we gotta be aggressive now.
[84:16.31]Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive.
[84:19.93]Good.
[84:28.47]Good, good, good, good, good.
[84:29.63]One more.
[84:29.93]There it is.
[84:34.41]Nice job.
[84:36.50]That was the most tired let's go ever.
[84:39.84]Let's go!
[84:55.96]This thing probably pushes it pretty far, right?
[85:01.42]I'm gonna play goalie.
[85:04.02]I actually think that's a smart use of my time right now.
[85:11.79]Alright, get it out of here.
[85:15.53]Yeah, this is off sides.
[85:16.43]You're gonna get a fucking red card.
[85:27.23]Where am I?
[85:27.71]Yeah, try getting by me.
[85:32.43]Oh shit, don't, please.
[85:39.97]Okay.
[85:51.92]And the goalie's coming out of his goal and he's going all the way down!
[85:57.24]We've never seen anything like this before in giant puck ice hockey.
[86:07.27]I helped.
[86:18.13]Defense.
[86:18.49]Let me handle this.
[86:26.34]I have my shield.
[86:28.76]Oh, deflected.
[86:30.22]Parried.
[86:32.56]Oh, parried again.
[86:33.62]Come on.
[86:34.17]You're just... I mean, you're getting parried.
[86:44.99]You guys got it?
[86:54.02]Stay forward.
[86:55.14]Face forward.
[87:02.14]Get out of here!
[87:10.73]Oh my god.
[87:11.59]That... My head spun 360 degrees.
[87:16.85]Oh, that's sad.
[87:17.91]Look at where I was.
[87:21.00]This game is fun.
[87:26.12]Alright, you wanna fight?
[87:27.18]I'll give you a fight.
[87:38.33]I blocked it with my body and my face and my head and my brain and the... and the concussion that I now have.
[87:46.16]I don't look so good.
[87:56.40]I just got off from a concussion, dude.
[87:58.06]Really?
[87:58.82]Unsportsmanlike conduct.
[88:08.68]Got it.
[88:16.66]They're dinosaurs, that's cool.
[88:30.24]If you come over here, I am going to make your life a living hell.
[88:44.16]Nice.
[88:47.48]Oh, the Oreo puke story?
[88:48.61]Okay.
[88:49.59]When I was... College.
[89:28.64]This is my chance.
[89:29.08]This is my chance.
[89:35.63]No, we can do it.
[89:37.27]Come on.
[89:43.23]Stay in the back a little.
[89:44.01]If it flies back here, I gotta be ready to get it.
[90:07.05]I just have to body block.
[90:13.86]This is so embarrassing.
[90:22.16]This is really embarrassing.
[90:26.33]It's like I took an extra five seconds to know I was still playing the game.
[90:37.07]Oh my god.
[90:38.13]Get out of here!
[90:38.75]Oh shit.
[90:58.43]Oh shit!
[91:02.31]You stood there like a kid in Little League.
[91:04.17]Yeah.
[91:12.30]Come on, it's right there.
[91:22.36]We won?
[91:22.84]Wasn't it a tie?
[91:24.06]Oh no, we did win.
[91:37.25]Just want to get in front of this guy and ruin the picture.
[91:47.90]Your character looks like you.
[91:51.38]I don't think... What do you mean?
[91:54.72]Explain.
[91:58.15]Explain.
[92:09.71]He does.
[92:11.65]Explain!
[92:12.07]It's the eyes?
[92:16.35]You guys think my eyes are that far apart?
[92:18.13]My eyes are not that far apart.
[92:34.34]Your eyes are close together.
[92:35.28]I think my eyes are very normal distance.
[92:45.73]We should compare.
[92:53.59]Looks like we struck a nerve.
[92:57.79]I don't care.
[92:58.33]I don't, like, I don't fucking care at all.
[93:01.59]It's just annoying.
[93:02.75]I don't give a shit.
[93:03.51]I don't care.
[93:03.93]You know what I mean?
[93:04.71]I don't give a fuck about that.
[93:06.87]I don't know.
[93:07.57]It's, like, annoying to me.
[93:08.68]I don't care, though.
[93:10.78]What are you talking about?
[93:12.36]I don't...
[93:25.11]No, no, you're not gonna get me off it.
[93:31.03]I'll pull it this way.
[93:34.44]I don't care as long as I'm behind the wind.
[93:37.32]Dude, everybody just stop grabbing at it.
[93:54.26]Oh, I'm going to fuck this up so bad.
[93:59.21]Oh, actually not bad.
[94:14.69]Oh, well, sacrifice yourself.
[94:17.61]Blue team wins, right?
[94:23.24]You need to do a bunch of win compensation there.
[94:27.29]Is somebody else alive?
[94:28.21]No.
[94:32.67]Dude, I'm on your team.
[94:38.64]Get up.
[94:51.08]We have to pull a lever.
[94:53.09]We're all going to die.
[94:54.55]That's what I want.
[94:58.55]I want chaos.
[95:06.29]Hit him instead.
[95:13.29]Oh, fuck.
[95:17.47]Alright, that's really strong.
[95:39.84]If anybody comes over to me, you're getting shot.
[95:48.93]Oh fuck, I need to live too?
[95:49.93]Oh shit.
[95:57.52]No!
[95:57.68]Oh shit, it's 2v1.
[95:58.28]This is not good.
[96:12.76]Oh.
[96:26.25]Oh, I got him.
[96:31.52]You not climb this?
[96:32.28]What's going on here?
[96:35.02]Why are you not doing this?
[96:38.56]Climb up this.
[96:42.71]Why can't I climb?
[96:47.94]Why couldn't I climb?
[96:48.72]You had to go around it was convex.
[96:59.96]Oh shit.
[97:22.30]Because they're going to sacrifice themselves.
[97:26.72]That was very, very low.
[97:28.94]Is he going to get blown off?
[97:59.07]I want to get the headbutt in.
[98:02.59]Alright, the goal is to stay all the way to the left.
[98:08.90]Everyone's gonna just.
[98:14.43]As we need stuff up now.
[98:29.98]Don't let go.
[98:32.81]Don't let go.
[98:33.61]Don't let go.
[98:34.49]I'm holding the thing down.
[99:04.19]We can all have one.
[99:05.45]Don't you know this is how we survive?
[99:13.52]What the fuck?
[99:14.68]I was what?
[99:16.48]What was that?
[99:26.87]What?
[99:27.13]I got annihilated.
[99:28.49]What was that all about?
[99:31.93]No, don't, no, don't, please.
[99:52.55]I got it, don't worry.
[99:56.72]Alright.
[100:01.13]Alright, lower profile.

[101:05.82]You didn't even get a crown.
[101:19.14]I got a crown my first game.
[101:22.29]And the second game and the third game.
[101:33.40]Are you playing against bots?
[101:35.45]No, it's a streamer mode zone.
[101:40.71]I just thought it was a thing I could click and I said, if they have it, something to enable, there's a reason why they want you to enable it.
[101:47.87]That's my philosophy on the whole thing.
[101:50.43]Ooh.
[102:02.24]Everybody loves this one.
[102:05.80]These are bots?
[102:06.62]I don't know.
[102:11.16]I need to get some new skins.
[102:27.00]You should roll for 10 skins.
[102:31.27]You have to get a high enough MMR to matchmake.
[102:34.13]Oh, is that for real?
[102:38.61]I kind of feel like I've been talking shit this whole time.
[102:55.48]Nice try.
[103:26.35]No, you don't.
[103:28.05]It's just 2v2.
[103:28.73]We got it.
[103:29.09]Come on, duck.
[103:30.33]You just pushed me off.
[103:35.31]You dope.
[103:37.36]You dope.
[103:41.10]You jumped off?
[103:41.68]Well, I jumped, but then he gave me the extra momentum to fly off.
[103:48.02]I would have landed perfectly fine and perfectly safe.
[104:01.17]Okay, come on.
[104:01.69]Does this thing hurt or does it just bounce?
[104:16.08]Yeah, I think it's just a bouncer.
[104:27.45]Swing at him!
[104:30.54]Why am I not swinging it anymore?
[104:31.80]Oh, see ya.
[104:43.37]Oh, that's my friend.
[104:43.99]Sorry.
[104:44.23]No!
[104:58.47]Oh shit, that hurt.
[105:01.37]I'm using a inflatable toy.
[105:14.58]Good start.
[105:17.78]I tried to save him.
[105:20.59]Don't even think about it.
[105:25.11]Was that hat?
[105:25.77]Oh, it's a banana.
[105:52.69]I have the weapon and I'm scared.
[106:02.61]No, give me back.
[106:03.09]Give me the weapon back.
[106:12.12]Yeah.
[106:23.80]I'm just not capable of doing that advanced technique, and I just tried.
[106:27.39]I went for the advanced technique, which is immediately run, jump, kick.
[106:37.55]And it was a problem.
[106:48.50]Why is Yoshi driving?
[106:53.25]I don't know.
[106:56.89]Yoshi!
[107:17.41]You can do it.
[107:18.57]I know you can.
[107:19.03]You have super power.
[107:22.00]Ugh.
[107:23.84]Don't do the dive jump.
[107:25.08]It's bad.
[107:25.90]Not a good idea right now.
[107:31.08]Good.
[107:31.70]Finish it off.
[107:32.92]Finish it.
[107:34.36]Good.
[107:34.70]Finish.
[107:35.74]Nice work.
[107:47.70]God damn it.
[107:54.01]Don't shoot me.
[107:54.55]Okay, I'm good.
[108:04.09]Oh, he's got me with the plunger.
[108:08.71]No, I'm plunged right now.
[108:18.45]It's, it's, where is it?
[108:19.81]What the fuck was that?
[108:21.18]What was I doing?
[108:36.05]The fact that he was pulling his arms behind his back trying to, oh, that was, that was cartoonish.
[108:46.93]That was fucking wedged.
[108:49.73]Jeez.
[108:50.19]Okay, as long as green doesn't win, we're good.
[108:56.91]I don't even know who... I don't know who won.
[108:58.51]They both fell off at the same time?
[108:59.57]That was fun.
[109:14.98]Alright, now I'm gonna get some skins.
[109:24.53]I'm like whispering a secret to him.
[109:41.79]That's a pumpkin head.
[109:43.13]That's kind of cool.
[109:43.55]Alright, let me go back and do something.
[109:46.73]Let's see.
[109:54.54]1500 cookies and some money.
[109:56.08]I got 200 bucks.
[109:57.32]Alright, what can I do?
[110:02.77]This one's 22,000.
[110:03.69]12,000.
[110:03.73]This is what people are spending their money on, I guess.
[110:10.44]Okay, yeah.
[110:11.44]That's cool.
[110:13.56]I like loo.
[110:25.23]Should I do it?
[110:26.23]With money?
[110:30.79]Why not, right?
[110:36.54]And... I got blue... I wanted loo, and now I have blue loo.
[110:46.33]Nice.
[110:46.67]Do I need to have loo to do blue loo?
[110:54.71]You should roll for 10.
[110:55.45]You have to buy the money.
[110:59.81]No, okay.
[111:01.65]Okay.
[111:07.95]Let's do it.
[111:08.43]I'm going to do one more and then I'm going to go take a quick break.
[111:13.34]And come back and do this one.
[111:15.42]You get money on level ups, yeah.
[111:25.89]Is he tired already?
[111:26.91]No.
[111:28.37]I'm lounging.
[111:29.23]I'm lounging.
[111:45.71]Show the beanbag chair.
[111:47.59]You will see it eventually.
[111:48.75]This is the one that we have not seen.
[111:59.65]You should wear a giant yellow raincoat on stream.
[112:06.24]Intriguing.
[112:18.04]Cool.
[112:18.64]Alright, Lulu.
[112:28.46]and get a big yellow hat and adopt a monkey.
[112:35.07]What did the man in the yellow hat do for a living?
[112:38.93]What did he do?
[112:39.69]He was an archaeologist.
[112:46.79]He was a researcher.
[112:47.55]He was a zookeeper.
[112:48.89]I was like, what a fit that is.
[112:56.63]Long brimmed yellow hat.
[112:59.57]And just a yellow jacket, yellow pants.
[113:04.99]That is an awesome look.
[113:07.07]I just showed up to work.
[113:12.77]And your boss was in the man, the curious George dad fit.
[113:19.21]Be like, holy shit.
[113:25.01]I really hate to do this.
[113:25.69]I'm really sorry.
[113:28.71]What just happened to my head?
[113:30.61]What did he just do?
[113:31.19]Did I just hit my head on his head?
[113:36.79]What just happened?
[113:42.84]Yes.
[113:43.82]Come on.
[113:49.00]Oh.
[113:51.08]I would say I deserved it, but it's a brief... No, it's not.
[113:59.08]What hit me?
[114:01.68]The gorilla is popular.
[114:02.66]Look at this.
[114:07.93]I kind of want the gorilla now.
[114:09.11]I feel like my gaming skill would increase by at least 25% if I was the gorilla.
[114:29.90]Got him on the backswing.
[114:41.65]Oh.
[114:45.28]What team am I on?
[114:48.36]I'm on green.
[114:49.14]Alright, I want you to win.
[114:51.24]You can do it.
[115:09.34]You can do it.
[115:11.24]Let them fight each other.
[115:15.89]Ooh, big punch.
[115:24.91]Almost got it.
[115:25.77]Watch out behind you though.
[115:28.41]I'm not in a Discord with anybody.
[115:30.33]What?
[115:31.33]They can't hear me.
[115:33.47]Seems to lose, right?
[115:38.81]Did we win?
[115:50.69]I want to stick this on somebody.
[115:53.41]Come here.
[116:01.29]Got you.
[116:11.02]Okay, let go.
[116:18.84]Shit.
[116:29.79]Okay, come here.
[116:33.51]I threw him far too.
[116:40.74]Good.
[116:40.98]I punched him in the face.
[116:42.04]In your arms.
[116:43.06]Nice work.
[116:59.30]Dude, you overshoot it every time.
[117:02.14]Fuck you.
[117:23.82]Oh, that's bad.
[117:25.40]Actually, kind of good.
[117:34.98]ah shoot alright two gorillas one with a nunchuck who wins
[118:04.58]He just knocked himself out with a nunchuck.
[118:05.78]That'd be so fun if he lost.
[118:06.74]Pretty even.
[118:22.23]You're AFK.
[118:22.81]I'm going to help you here.
[118:24.17]See?
[118:26.35]I didn't kill you.
[118:26.91]You're AFK.
[118:28.29]Remember that for when you try to get me.
[118:44.28]How is it going through the gap between their two heads?
[118:46.68]That's what I want to know.
[118:57.27]Oh, don't even think about it.
[119:08.00]Shit.
[119:09.26]This guy...
[119:13.72]cat is over there still lying down.
[119:17.68]I need to rescue the cat.
[119:19.02]I'm rescuing the cat.
[119:19.75]I think it's too late.
[119:28.53]Oh, come on.
[119:30.37]The cat.
[119:31.35]The cat's going down.
[119:32.81]Cat's going down.
[119:34.89]Iceberg melting.
[119:38.05]Oh, I feel bad.
[119:38.79]That was my fault.
[119:49.87]I'm gonna get up first and we're gonna win.
[119:57.42]Get... Come on, what?
[120:02.44]Oh, give me a break.
[120:05.51]I was grabbing onto the ledge and then my left arm grabbed onto his head and then pushed his head down.
[120:11.26]I just saw blood and I just had to just continue.
[120:14.78]No, why didn't you climb up?
[120:17.52]Whatever.
[120:19.12]Oh, this is gonna be fun.
[120:19.76]Oh, I was gonna try to have like 10 plungers in his head.
[120:37.37]I'm staying o- NO!
[120:39.35]I wanna stay over here with the cat.
[120:53.72]Oh.
[121:05.59]Shit.
[121:10.19]This is big for me.
[121:19.73]No.
[121:23.51]Excuse me?
[121:32.66]Get me the fuck away from that.
[121:35.62]Wait.
[121:43.37]You idiot.
[121:50.23]The two red theme is still here.
[121:52.68]Alright, I'm going to hang up for a second.
[122:04.54]Oh, fuck.
[122:09.96]Get away from me.
[122:25.27]Oh, conductivity.
[122:27.36]I forgot about conductivity.
[122:29.76]Sorry, I'm still alive.
[122:36.60]Run!
[122:43.33]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[122:48.17]Why are you having so much trouble getting up?
[122:51.32]Come on, dude, get up.
[122:53.10]Do it!
[122:54.20]Get up!
[122:55.68]Why is he not getting up?
[122:57.70]Why is he not getting up?
[123:00.39]Did I win?
[123:02.71]No stamina.
[123:03.91]Oh, I think we still won.
[123:05.57]Alright, one more.
[123:08.75]This might be a win right here.
[123:22.88]I just knocked somebody out with my body weight.
[123:35.55]What happened?
[123:37.41]What happened?
[123:47.29]Get out of here.
[123:50.05]Come on.
[123:50.43]Who wants to fuck around?
[123:52.35]Who wants to fuck around?
[124:05.36]Get that thing away from me.
[124:13.32]This is it.
[124:14.32]This is a win right here if I get it.
[124:15.30]If I get it.
[124:15.60]I got it.
[124:15.82]I got it.
[124:16.04]I got it.
[124:16.28]This is a win.
[124:16.95]This is a guaranteed win.
[124:35.17]I thought everybody was dead.
[124:39.65]I thought everybody was dead.
[124:41.47]But they were just on a different part of the map.
[124:46.12]That dude's probably pissed.
[124:48.28]That's the first time that person's got that power up.
[124:51.42]And they get hit with a coin.
[125:03.03]OK, we're still in it.
[125:04.81]As long as there's no green.
[125:08.56]Unfortunately.
[125:12.80]Yellow can win, that's fine.
[125:16.62]Good.
[125:20.20]Blue winning here would be huge.
[125:26.42]So we're going to try to put our thumb on the scale here.
[125:29.24]Nice job.
[125:37.43]You're green?
[125:38.73]Yeah, I don't want yellow to win.
[125:42.79]Okay.
[125:43.67]Oh, blue had one win too.
[125:44.85]Shit.
[125:45.11]Alright, this is it.
[125:45.79]This is the one here.
[125:46.85]Let me try as hard as I can.
[125:47.59]1, 2, 3, go.
[125:53.82]Stop.
[125:57.46]Wow.
[125:58.10]Oh, please tell me I eliminated five people.
[126:16.24]We don't want blue to win.
[126:17.46]Blue or yellow has to lose.
[126:21.99]Where's my teammate?
[126:23.45]Do I have a teammate?
[126:34.80]Oh, shit.
[126:40.68]No!
[126:41.18]I need that pen!
[126:46.13]Oh, my God.
[126:46.89]It hit me right in the face.
[126:47.95]It hit me right in the face.
[126:50.71]That's so frustrating.
[126:55.42]You can do it.
[126:56.38]I know you can get up there.
[126:57.72]Oh, be careful, though.
[126:58.58]What?
[127:09.61]What?
[127:10.05]What?
[127:10.47]What?
[127:11.01]What?
[127:29.59]What did I just do?
[127:37.90]No, I had an opportunity, but I missed it.
[127:39.17]Holy shit, whoever did that, you just saved everything.
[128:00.54]Shit now right to him.
[128:03.22]Don't.
[128:04.46]Oh my God, why is he so super powered?
[128:08.68]Why does he have super powers?
[128:10.20]How do you get?
[128:10.76]How do you get the superpower?
[128:19.22]You have to eat the biscuit or drink all.
[128:27.21]Damn it.
[128:33.36]Did I even have a teammate?
[128:34.38]I feel like I didn't have a teammate that whole time.
[128:47.71]This is all gorillas.
[128:49.95]You killed him with the bomb.
[129:02.03]Oh, that seems to be a theme.
[129:03.89]Where's my teammate?
[129:04.75]What happened?
[129:06.17]Oh, you killed him in the first five seconds.
[129:07.67]Oh, right.
[129:08.67]Makes sense.
[129:09.23]Right, sure.
[129:12.12]He was AFK the whole time.
[129:13.14]I think we did pretty good for AFK teammate.
[129:23.63]Can we bully Jerma?
[129:25.59]No.
[129:27.91]But you lighten up for a little bit.
[129:39.57]Bullies you.
[129:40.41]Stop.
[129:40.71]It's not his birthday anymore.
[129:51.44]We don't have to be nice to him.
[129:54.02]It's my birthday month.
[129:55.64]Hey, if Grimace gets to do that, I do too.
[129:57.92]You gotta follow the same rules.
[130:16.46]Where's your weird milkshake?
[130:30.29]Alright, this is a goofy one.
[130:47.51]Is it lit?
[130:48.73]Oh, that's not good.
[130:52.37]Saved by the bomb.
[130:58.80]What do I do with it?
[131:06.69]There was no way to put it.
[131:19.32]Alright.
[131:19.74]Good job, blue team.
[131:26.81]No, it's my bomb.
[131:31.15]Oh, I got him.
[131:31.97]I got him.
[131:32.43]He bailed on the bomb and it was the mistake.
[131:35.01]He bailed on the bomb.
[131:48.51]I'm alright.
[131:49.87]I got a hand on the, uh, on it.
[131:51.34]Oh!
[132:12.07]This is one of those laughing games, you know what I mean?
[132:23.33]I kind of threw pretty hard right there.
[132:24.63]I'm not going to lie.
[132:26.35]That was really dumb.
[132:28.17]I actually just threw.
[132:36.66]Where's my teammate?
[132:39.52]Oh, there you go.
[132:40.64]Well, we'll get him next time.
[132:53.27]We're in the head.
[132:54.15]Aww.
[132:58.34]You're gonna get kicked from the clan for that one.
[133:18.08]I get so impatient here because I just want to throw rocks at them.
[133:21.95]The bomb is awesome, but... Anybody's game, we're good.
[133:44.56]Ouch.
[133:47.59]That was a really good throw too.
[133:49.85]Oh unfortunate.
[133:50.71]That was a great throw.
[133:52.41]Perfect placement.
[133:59.64]Alright, let me see if I can drop bomb.
[134:11.23]Got it.
[134:11.45]I just threw it right there.
[134:12.43]Decent placement.
[134:16.57]Lots of damage on blue.
[134:17.53]We don't want blue to win.
[134:22.29]No.
[134:24.71]Oh, too bad.
[134:39.48]That's if you can get this thing, it's game over.
[134:46.20]Oh, I need to buy the handle.
[134:48.50]No!
[134:49.80]No, nobody can use it.
[134:51.82]Shit!
[134:52.88]Come on!
[134:57.86]Your teammate's AFK, is he?
[134:59.06]It's not like it really matters that much.
[135:07.25]You have five feet of space next to you.
[135:11.13]People just ramming into each other anyways.
[135:25.01]Floating dead in the river right now.
[135:28.95]Nobody's won yet.
[135:29.59]We're doing alright.
[135:40.18]That... I didn't even see that.
[135:44.52]Am I the only one that died from that?
[135:46.58]I'm the only person that died from that.
[135:52.78]Okay, well, blue.
[135:54.80]This is going to be a good bomb here.
[135:57.39]Right there.
[135:59.59]Perfect.
[136:00.87]Oh, that's going to be great.
[136:02.47]Watch this.
[136:05.24]Oh.
[136:05.40]I thought they were going to get launched over to it.
[136:10.12]Blue cannot win.
[136:12.70]Come on, cat.
[136:13.34]You got it.
[136:13.94]Nice throw.
[136:15.65]There we go.
[136:34.93]Don't be... Okay, you guys can do that all you want.
[136:45.53]Whoa.
[136:47.59]Wow.
[136:49.33]What happened to that guy?
[136:51.47]Hey, we did it.
[137:05.13]He hit himself.
[137:06.05]OK.
[137:14.80]Wait, I gotta drink that, right?
[137:24.78]I plunged him.
[137:28.02]Watch out for that bomb.
[137:28.90]It's going to eliminate every single person.
[137:31.86]This is going to be awesome.
[137:40.04]it up dude really really everyone's like running around the bomb no I would have picked it up I would have been the first person to pick it up oh red one I need to win another one oh game's addicting
[138:25.32]Damn it.
[138:27.08]Okay, one more.
[138:29.96]And then I'm going to actually go to Bethlehem.
[138:34.11]Get blue deathmaning beetles?
[138:36.95]No.
[138:40.99]We want them.
[138:42.81]We just want to be in a position where we can take care of them.
[138:48.46]It's all like the traveling.
[138:50.50]Lots of stuff going on.
[138:54.57]I would say probably like in the new year we'll probably get them.
[139:00.16]I want to make sure we can really like truly pay attention to them and everything.
[139:06.00]What is this?
[139:06.56]I've never seen this one.
[139:07.26]Oh, let's play the new one.
[139:08.96]They're very easy to take care of.
[139:24.57]That's what we have heard.
[139:26.03]Hey, they love grapes, right?
[139:31.54]I love grapes.
[139:34.54]It was just meant to be.
[139:35.30]Did you get a pet lobster?
[139:43.76]That's cool.
[139:45.99]I love fish.
[139:47.09]I love aquatic life.
[139:48.21]I love marine life.
[139:50.27]But I don't... Taking care of aquatic life, there's a lot of maintenance, like cleaning the tank and making sure that the levels are good, right?
[140:00.75]Like you can't just like, oh, there's my lobster.
[140:02.35]I mean, I've heard it's very fulfilling.
[140:14.50]And it's really cool to have like a bunch of fish in a fish tank or lobsters or crabs or whatever people do.
[140:28.69]I'm gonna score my first goal ever.
[140:37.41]Hey.
[140:51.25]It's inside of that.
[141:12.20]How are you that good to be able to do that?
[141:32.56]Also, the play is probably just a stand still while everybody just runs into each other.
[141:35.58]There we go.
[141:38.21]Nice.
[141:56.68]Are you excited for the FNAF movie?
[141:59.97]Yeah, I'll watch that one on x4 speed instead of x6 speed.
[142:05.44]So yeah, I mean, I'm going to tell I'm very excited for it.
[142:21.35]We both saw X.
[142:24.15]Yeah, I don't... I want to see Saw X. But I don't want to go to the theater to see Saw X. Although they're making this one a big deal.
[142:43.04]This one's a big deal.
[142:52.33]And we all know how much of a fan I am of the Sawboys.
[142:57.43]Although, I can't say I remember what happened between 5 and 10.
[143:10.10]Oh my god, I... wow.
[143:12.92]I jumped in the air and he hit me right in the chin.
[143:23.77]Come on, come on, go, go, go, go, go straight there.
[143:34.00]Stop him from doing this.
[143:36.18]How did we not stop him from doing that?
[143:48.40]Marathon them.
[143:59.98]I still do want to do that thing I talked about.
[144:03.19]It might just be a video.
[144:04.85]I think it's funnier as a video.
[144:14.99]Yeah, so watch along.
[144:18.35]Wait, did I?
[144:19.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:19.79]What's happening?
[144:20.58]I forgot what team I was on.
[144:21.34]Am I going?
[144:22.54]Is this correct?
[144:23.88]Is this bad?
[144:45.98]That got everybody.
[144:47.98]That wiped out the whole crew.
[144:53.99]Oh my.
[144:56.31]This has been a big talking stream more than a gaming stream.
[145:07.32]It can be both.
[145:08.64]But a game like this is pretty much just kind of goofy and fun to sit here and play it.
[145:29.82]pulling his hair oh shit I forgot I was gonna go alright one more how's the mystery video well there are two videos that I want to do the one I was just talking about and then this one the mystery one I'm only making the mystery video for me it's not for anybody else so when you see this just it was not I didn't make it for anybody else
[145:59.20]It could get 10 views and I wouldn't even care.
[146:13.15]Everyone wants to play them.
[146:15.69]I'm bad at these ones.
[146:16.51]I don't like these ones.
[146:20.98]Okay, I won't watch it.
[146:22.56]That's alright.
[146:23.12]It actually is fine because the video is not going to be any good.
[146:27.68]This video is going to overstay its welcome in the first 30 seconds.
[146:30.40]And it's going to be like a seven minute video.
[146:35.15]Or more.
[146:35.71]It could be longer.
[146:36.33]I don't know.
[146:42.28]I am actually going to play goalie this time.
[146:58.93]Alright, good, good, good, go.
[147:00.41]Nice.
[147:07.98]Somebody else is playing goalie.
[147:09.60]Watch this, I'm gonna go block this guy up.
[147:16.84]Yeah, I'm talking to you!
[147:28.84]What the fuck?
[147:29.82]I... I see I'm distracting him.
[147:38.73]This is bad for him.
[147:50.45]Alright, alright, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[147:51.75]Alright, alright, I'm done, I'm done.
[148:04.76]I have a good spot right here.
[148:05.92]Give me a spot right now.
[148:06.90]Let's just make a line right to the goal.
[148:10.16]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[148:12.77]Here we go.
[148:15.73]3, 2, 1.
[148:24.99]Dude, get it out of here.
[148:48.55]We're good?
[148:50.46]What'd you say?
[149:04.15]Get over there.
[149:15.46]I get credit for that one.
[149:19.46]Perfect bounce.
[149:25.31]I like that little guy.
[149:26.13]He's funny.
[149:27.19]The shark?
[149:27.75]Yeah.
[149:34.75]I'll be the last one to get up.
[149:35.83]I would have been there.
[149:40.03]But I was so late to get up.
[149:54.37]Hey, good night, Jerma.
[149:55.11]You should have played Fall Guys instead.
[150:01.04]I don't want to play Fall Guys.
[150:02.20]I want to play Party Animals.
[150:10.55]I'm getting in the goal.
[150:11.53]This is dangerous.
[150:37.09]I've just seen a goalie come out and do that.
[150:38.81]The other team scores on their goal.
[150:52.70]Oh, he's not on the goal.
[150:53.75]He's not on the goal.
[150:54.51]He's not on the goal.
[150:55.23]Uh-oh.
[150:58.17]Not on the goal.
[151:03.85]Hey, hey, hey, bro, bro.
[151:07.20]Get your head in the game.
[151:19.66]Who else wasn't in the goal?
[151:23.50]Yeah, but I. Belly to belly suplex that guy.
[151:29.88]Worth something.
[151:41.32]That cat's eyes.
[151:42.18]Holy shit, that cat.
[151:47.81]That cat, like, hotboxed his room for an hour.
[151:50.75]Okay.
[151:54.37]Alright, I'll be right back.
[152:01.55]Just gonna get another... I'll get some water.
[152:03.95]Go to the bathroom.
[152:06.77]Back in... Two minutes?
[152:10.09]Three minutes?
[155:59.80]I am back.
[156:04.78]Yeah, I want to do something.
[156:07.30]Check this out, ready?
[156:07.92]I need to turn the game down.
[156:19.27]Have you guys ever done this before?
[156:21.96]The brainstorm or green needle?
[156:26.58]Viral video?
[156:31.14]Some of you have.
[156:31.70]Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.
[156:35.98]It's really... It's weird.
[156:37.40]Okay, so... There's this toy that when you press a button on it, it plays an audio file.
[156:53.05]And the audio file that it plays, it goes, Brainstorm.
[156:58.99]Brainstorm.
[157:01.29]but you can make your brain, you can make yourself hear something else.
[157:07.61]Let's do the experiment.
[157:08.39]It's been like five years.
[157:09.68]Hey, I just found it, so whatever.
[157:15.56]I'm 40 and I'm retired, okay?
[157:17.96]We find things a little later.
[157:18.96]I want to do it.
[157:28.94]Brainstorm.
[157:33.81]Because sometimes it'll say both at the same time and it's freaky.
[157:37.16]Alright, here we go.
[157:43.36]Ready?
[157:44.18]What do you hear?
[157:52.76]Do you hear brainstorm or do you hear green needle?
[158:12.71]Brainstorm.
[158:17.27]Brainstorm.
[158:19.83]Right?
[158:21.12]Brainstorm.
[158:22.82]Okay.
[158:23.94]Green needle.
[158:27.38]Green needle.
[158:32.20]Green needle.
[158:34.32]Brainstorm.
[158:39.64]Who the fuck is hearing Green Needle?
[158:41.98]It's gonna happen.
[158:43.20]You know that image of, I think it's like a spinning ballerina, that if you watch it long enough, it spins the other way?
[158:49.62]It's like that.
[158:50.16]Just give it a second.
[158:56.77]Green Needle.
[158:57.75]BuzzFeed Andy.
[159:04.63]Green Needle.
[159:09.50]Isn't that cool?
[159:11.70]Isn't that interesting?
[159:12.22]Isn't that cool?
[159:20.57]I heard radio static.
[159:22.87]Huh?
[159:27.61]Getting real 78-year-old grandmother showing something on the computer vibes.
[159:35.36]Do Yanny and... Oh, yeah, this one, too.
[159:37.68]Let's try this one.
[159:39.72]Alright, what do you hear on this one?
[159:52.32]What do you hear?
[159:55.91]Laurel.
[159:58.17]Laurel.
[160:01.91]It's hard for me to get it to do the other one.
[160:07.02]Because it goes like, Yanny.
[160:10.42]Yanny.
[160:12.01]Yanny.
[160:13.63]Yanny.
[160:15.49]Yanny.
[160:16.49]I can't get it to say Yanny.
[160:17.95]Yanny.
[160:20.33]Yanny.
[160:20.93]No, I can't get it to do Yanny now.
[160:25.71]Yanny.
[160:27.58]Yanny.
[160:28.52]Shit.
[160:29.20]Yanny.
[160:29.88]It's Laurel only.
[160:30.70]Yanny.
[160:31.94]Say, say, Yanny.
[160:33.72]Yanny.
[160:34.12]Shit.
[160:35.54]Shit.
[160:39.16]Okay, so the parts, the kind of, like, the vibrato of the voice, it's like... It goes like... But I can't get him to do it now.
[160:55.71]Shit.
[160:57.79]Damn it.
[161:06.66]Larry.
[161:08.78]Larry.
[161:11.72]Yeah, sometimes it goes Laurel.
[161:14.90]Yeti.
[161:16.66]Yenny.
[161:20.94]Larry.
[161:21.64]I can't get him to do it now.
[161:29.22]Alright, what do you, uh... There's a couple more interesting ones, too.
[161:36.93]I can't get him to do it.
[161:37.95]I'm going to try one more time.
[161:40.41]Yanny, say it.
[161:45.25]There's a couple more cool ones.
[161:48.58]Let's try this one.
[161:55.80]Alright, do you hear?
[161:57.80]This one tripped me up big time.
[162:02.13]Do you hear a burp or a fart?
[162:05.53]Which one?
[162:06.51]It's hard for me to decipher it.
[162:09.71]What do you guys hear?
[162:19.34]What'd you hear?
[162:25.42]See, I can't get it to burp now.
[162:31.66]No, still.
[162:32.30]What are you guys hearing?
[162:41.43]You hear both?
[162:43.27]Let me try it one more time.
[162:47.29]I'm saying if you slow them down, you can hear different things, really?
[163:06.11]Hey, I'm hearing Laurel.
[163:09.13]That's interesting.
[163:09.95]I hear brainstorm.
[163:16.15]Minus 3 million.
[163:19.25]Well, unfortunately, you can't take that many points away.
[163:22.24]There's only 100 points, so I still get an F. You could have said you minus 50 points, and I still get an F.
[163:35.23]Dude, you're embarrassing me.
[163:36.35]Alright, let's keep playing.
[163:43.13]This is fun.
[163:53.00]Yenny.
[163:53.48]Yenny.
[163:54.70]Yenny.
[163:55.38]Okay, if you take what I just did and mess with it, can you make it say Laurel?
[164:00.24]That's my question.
[164:18.33]Is it going to haunt me in my sleep?
[164:21.01]Um... Just like... Eat like a couple of blueberries.
[164:24.79]You'll be alright.
[164:26.75]Alrighty.
[164:27.21]Let's do it.
[164:37.32]Did I get any new stuff?
[164:41.18]Did I get any new things?
[164:44.35]Refreshes in three days?
[164:49.06]Okay.
[164:53.98]Oh, is it a burp or a fart?
[164:58.86]This is so funny.

[166:55.13]Austin.
[166:59.59]Yeah, this is just, this is kind of scary.
[167:04.11]Austin Powers DVD menu.
[167:10.13]Okay.

[168:06.37]This is what they thought of.
[168:12.79]Wow Okay, hold on
[168:47.85]I tried to save you it's it's the same genre of music there's two or three of the same instruments what about hold on no I can't I'm sorry I can't save you but you know what's cool though
[169:13.34]I... It could be.
[169:16.56]It really could be.
[169:17.38]This could be the mask DVD menu.
[169:19.34]You could have convinced everybody.
[169:20.36]In fact, it should be.
[169:21.40]Alright, what's going on?
[169:23.84]Oh, I'm in an activity.
[169:32.18]Change outfit.
[169:34.62]Ah.
[169:34.86]Wait, surprise egg.
[169:35.68]Do I have enough?
[169:39.58]Nope.
[169:42.92]Alright, let's play.
[169:58.19]Olive Garden music.
[170:02.86]I remember that.
[170:03.44]That was great.
[170:04.86]That was a really fun night.
[170:14.71]Jackbox?
[170:22.71]It could be Jackbox.
[170:30.72]Alright, I want to play this one.
[170:32.96]No, no one wants to play the middle one.
[170:35.44]Take the balloon safe back to base to earn points.
[170:38.70]Alright, let's go.
[170:48.02]Just have to grab onto it?
[170:52.46]Have you ever done a jackbox stream?
[170:57.22]Oh yeah, lots of times.
[171:01.27]Lots of times.
[171:03.29]Oh, it says my mouse is moving?
[171:05.91]Okay.
[171:07.61]It's been a very long time.
[171:15.34]I think the reason why I don't do Jackbox streams anymore is because, uh, all the answers.
[171:21.04]Oh, Fibbage.
[171:22.82]Okay, everybody.
[171:24.04]So what do you think is the answer?
[171:26.84]Is it Jerma985?
[171:29.56]Jerma sucks.
[171:30.94]Jerma pooped his pants.
[171:32.46]Or Jerma sucks.
[171:35.04]Which one of those is it?
[171:35.98]I was just like, well, these are all kind of the same answer, aren't they somehow?
[171:47.61]Who am I holding onto?
[171:48.71]I apologize.
[171:52.57]Can I apologize?
[171:54.27]I apologize to that person.
[172:07.08]He just messed everything up for me.
[172:23.10]Alright.
[172:23.72]I have you in a chokehold.
[172:26.78]I don't know who has who here.
[172:29.90]He's stuffing me into a locker.
[172:32.51]I can't get out of here.
[172:35.51]What the hell?
[172:40.80]Get off me.
[172:42.10]Just don't bite his neck.
[172:43.66]Bite him.
[172:52.05]I'm getting my revenge.
[172:57.86]It's not right here.
[173:06.04]Shit.
[173:30.28]Yeah!
[173:31.14]Got him!
[173:35.16]Let's make this way easier for us.
[173:46.15]I don't know how this one works.
[173:48.75]This thing floats around and we have to put it over here.
[173:55.59]We got it.
[173:56.01]Alright, press the button.
[174:00.79]I think we got it.
[174:21.58]Yeah, we do.
[174:24.16]Mic is rolling, I'm plugged.
[174:28.62]There we go.
[174:44.55]Oh, everyone's holding onto it.
[174:46.01]Alright, we need to bring it where?
[174:49.25]I don't really know what's happening, but we're having fun.
[175:02.16]We just got it again.
[175:09.08]No, no, no, no.
[175:11.69]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!
[175:15.47]Right there!
[175:16.37]Right there!
[175:17.87]No!
[175:21.58]Knock it out.
[175:24.58]Okay, cool.
[175:26.08]The first victory in an hour and a half.
[175:46.07]This is a really bad picture.
[176:02.45]Beautiful.
[176:05.65]Is it at September 27th already?
[176:12.67]I blinked and we went from May to September.
[176:27.45]Icebreaker is a lot of fun.
[176:29.33]Probably one of the best maps I think.
[176:30.23]That's what retirement does to you.
[176:44.14]I'm very active.
[176:50.61]I have 0.99.
[176:54.61]I want to do that.
[176:56.59]When's the update?
[176:57.55]Isn't there a big update coming really soon?
[176:59.87]Because I'll definitely play it when the update comes out.
[177:01.55]Somewhere in October, right?
[177:22.21]try to punch my teammate and yes, I'm sorry about it.
[177:25.25]Ooh, okay, okay, okay.
[177:31.74]When you hurt me, I went Super Saiyan.
[177:33.46]Am I actually gonna fall down here at Super Saiyan?
[177:46.95]I'm gonna ruin this for everybody.
[177:48.34]This is gonna be great.
[177:51.00]Look at this.
[178:00.88]That should count for a win from me.
[178:02.80]I should get points for that.
[178:06.75]I should get every point for that one.
[178:08.43]Oh, that was great.
[178:23.07]I'm so sorry, but you definitely lost.
[178:27.34]Why are we all on one of them?
[178:29.22]There's more than one.
[178:30.26]Oh boy, that's not good.
[178:53.07]Come on, what the hell?
[178:58.35]It's like he did that for dramatic effect.
[179:00.44]Alright, let's see.
[179:05.56]Yeah, see you later.
[179:06.66]I'm going to put it right in the middle.
[179:11.70]Oh, that's bad for you.
[179:14.36]That whatever the pig guy.
[179:19.27]Oh, the wind actually held it.
[179:25.33]You're terrible at this game.
[179:32.47]I know you are, but what am I?
[179:44.11]The pig is on my team.
[179:47.69]For some reason, I always just think I'm on green team.
[179:52.02]Because to me, green is like, yeah, green versus red.
[179:54.67]Or I'm always on green team.
[180:27.20]That bunny is pissed because of what I did last... Wow.
[180:32.34]You can hear the button pressing.
[180:39.13]Somebody turn it on.
[180:41.71]I got you.
[180:43.49]Don't let go.
[181:22.29]Hey, hey, you're weighing it down.
[181:23.31]He's weighing it down.
[181:23.91]He just weighed it down.
[181:26.29]He sat on top of the N64 cartridge and it just went right in.
[182:03.65]There's another one.
[182:12.03]Get up!
[182:12.31]I'm trying to get away from the bomb.
[182:18.79]I'm trying to get away from the bomb.
[182:29.62]Headbutt with that glorious head of yours.
[182:34.31]I'm going to wait for the... Actually, you know what?
[182:37.91]Oh, never mind.
[182:38.85]Okay.
[182:41.63]Yellow team is the two to beat.
[182:52.12]Oh, he's going to slurp down there.
[182:54.10]Yep.
[183:00.87]Oh, he didn't even
[183:11.66]I have to hold on to my friend.
[183:14.21]Oh shit.
[183:18.35]Big move right there.
[183:19.17]Okay, we win, we win, we win, we win, we win, we win.
[183:27.71]We win, we win.
[183:32.15]No!
[183:35.59]I just hit him in the head with that.
[183:39.61]I'm so sorry.
[183:41.53]I'm so sorry.
[183:47.40]Are you still alive?
[183:48.88]You can do it, man.
[183:49.84]I know you can.
[183:53.66]You can do it.
[183:59.47]Where is he?
[184:05.47]Where is he?
[184:07.89]Where was he then?
[184:08.49]Hold on.
[184:09.33]My control is in my lap right now.
[184:15.01]Whatever.
[184:15.95]Yeah, good luck everybody.
[184:35.10]Oh, that's not good for the Persona.
[184:37.04]No, that's my friend!
[184:37.94]But I gave him a bomb and he's gonna utilize it.
[184:59.33]Nice throw.
[185:00.64]Alright, I have confidence in the dog.
[185:04.24]You got this.
[185:04.74]Nice job.
[185:06.22]Stay alive.
[185:06.64]I'm going to wait for a bomb.
[185:17.37]My team is green.
[185:27.66]Almost there.
[185:29.68]I might wait for the last one.
[185:33.18]Yeah, let's do it now.
[185:43.03]You're OK.
[185:43.99]I just said.
[186:11.50]That's not cool.
[186:12.70]That's not cool.
[186:15.08]He's gone.
[186:29.61]See, to me, you pick the bomb up when it's 2v2 and you just run at the other guy.
[186:32.56]And then you drop it and turn around, last second jump.
[186:42.41]Oh no.
[186:45.89]No.
[186:46.51]Oh, you're both going down.
[186:47.71]You gotta get something up.
[186:56.46]Oh!
[186:58.36]I don't... Who was it?
[186:59.96]Okay, good.
[187:01.90]Is the game fun?
[187:02.62]Yeah, oh yeah.
[187:03.28]It's really fun.
[187:44.22]Okay, we're safe.
[187:46.26]Oh, this cat.
[187:46.92]Can I pull the cat through?
[187:50.30]Oh my goodness.
[188:02.41]Okay.
[188:09.49]Big moves.
[188:10.53]Big moves.
[188:14.00]Got two of us here.
[188:25.88]Just like clawing under his head.
[188:27.63]No, we're all going.
[188:29.59]Oh, and that one guy that's stuck right there.
[188:32.87]That's so annoying.
[188:40.39]Oh, we should have spread out.
[188:41.45]That was my fault.
[188:42.13]Should have went the other way.
[188:55.11]That's the best one of the whole night.
[188:58.17]Really good one.
[189:03.27]That's a fan.
[189:04.13]How do I add it?
[189:05.94]I want it.
[189:06.28]That's a great one.
[189:21.08]You think they'll ever be one of these where everyone just behaves, just stands in line.
[189:27.99]I'd like to see that.
[189:28.65]Do you do your own laundry or do you have a butler?
[189:42.14]I have six butlers.
[189:51.69]One for the left arm, one for the right arm, one to put my head through.
[189:56.15]And one to feed me while I'm doing it.
[189:59.27]The other two tie my shoes.
[190:02.93]And then the other one reads me the daily briefing of the day that I need to hear.
[190:07.15]Number seven brushes my teeth.
[190:14.47]Number eight has already...
[190:22.39]I don't know.
[190:23.03]I can just do whatever he wants.
[190:25.52]They asked you if you did your own laundry.
[190:41.04]Oh, uh, yes.
[190:49.65]Screw that.
[190:50.27]I'm going up here.
[190:57.92]Why fight when you can guarantee you'll be in the top four if you just come over?
[191:08.83]Oh my god, I just laid this person out so hard.
[191:38.02]why did we both just do that that was very odd I'm not coming up here yet you guys you can stay up there and taunt all you want look at these look at these clowns over here
[192:03.62]Okay, good.
[192:05.34]Very good.
[192:05.98]That's exactly what I wanted to see.
[192:12.30]I'm just going to hold on.
[192:13.06]I'm just going to hold on to this pole.
[192:17.75]Am I still holding on to it?
[192:29.03]Somebody saved my life.
[192:35.04]This is like, I had quite a few cocktails.
[192:38.01]I'm just going to lie in here.
[192:46.58]I am the king of the mountain.
[192:48.84]I think I won.
[192:52.98]I did, right?
[192:54.66]Yeah.
[192:54.94]They've been in the water for way longer than I have.
[193:09.46]OK, I was gonna say geez.
[193:27.43]Oh, it worked.
[193:28.93]It worked, but I got hurt.
[193:37.13]Hello.
[193:59.41]I think I'm gonna be alright.
[194:03.59]I I'm gonna be alright.
[194:08.33]I'm alright.
[194:18.78]Do it.
[194:24.89]Over under the wind.
[194:25.45]Alright, who wants to fuck around?
[194:34.80]That was a big mistake.
[194:45.30]It's alright.
[194:45.62]It's alright.
[194:45.90]It's alright.
[194:46.22]Fine.
[194:46.50]It's alright.
[194:47.10]I still have my teammate here, right?
[195:01.33]Pretty sure the team is still there, right?
[195:04.09]Oh, too bad.
[195:04.61]You can grab right here.
[195:17.08]Shit.
[195:24.84]Well, looks like it's the left.

[196:32.95]Uh, I'm dead!
[196:34.21]I'm dead.
[196:36.76]The guy just... Alright.
[196:41.40]Well, now... Now you're dead.
[196:45.76]My buddy's up there now.
[196:47.00]Wait, you want a coin right to the head?
[196:50.13]Oh!
[196:58.30]I may have made a mistake.
[197:00.70]I am bad.
[197:01.26]It's okay though.
[197:04.74]It's okay.
[197:07.74]As long as you don't win.
[197:08.90]Oh man.
[197:11.41]I gotta aim much lower than that.
[197:23.29]Okay, I gotta hit this.
[197:24.43]This is make or break.
[197:25.90]I have to hit this.
[197:27.78]Who's in first?
[197:29.20]Who's in first?
[197:32.28]Oh, would you look at that?
[197:33.18]That's not much damage that the duck has.
[198:03.85]Say hi to fucking Satan for me
[198:39.02]Look at him.
[198:44.99]That is like rapid.
[198:52.09]What?
[198:52.93]How does he hit me like that?
[198:54.41]There's no way.
[199:08.45]I still got my buddy over here.
[199:09.65]Are you good?
[199:11.41]Hey.
[199:13.63]I'm not going up there.
[199:15.23]That's a stupid idea.
[199:16.15]Let's... Hey, hang out down here.
[199:17.23]Yeah, let him do that.
[199:21.05]No room up there.
[199:28.88]I... I'm gonna uninstall the game.
[199:30.60]I'm so... I'm so fucking mad.
[199:35.84]No.
[199:39.50]I tried to hit it.
[199:40.96]It's okay.
[199:41.91]I'm still here.
[199:44.71]And I'm still fine.
[199:46.23]I'm still... No, I'm not.
[199:46.95]It's over.
[199:47.55]Oh my god.
[199:48.19]I feel so bad.
[199:58.44]Use me.
[199:58.76]Just use me.
[199:59.52]Use me.
[199:59.80]Use me as a raft.
[200:01.06]Use me as a raft.
[200:01.62]Use me as a raft.
[200:02.86]Use me as a raft.
[200:03.92]Oh, whatever.
[200:08.12]Ugh.
[200:09.40]Ugh, I punched him right in the nose like it couldn't have been cleaner and right in the face.
[200:24.31]Yeah.
[200:24.53]Yeah, this guy.
[200:25.17]Yeah.
[200:28.78]Okay.
[200:29.14]Okay.
[200:30.16]Okay.
[200:30.74]I'm getting that racket.
[200:31.58]I'm gonna smash your head in with it.
[200:45.01]Get out of here.
[200:57.29]We both need to have weapons and we got this in the clear.
[201:09.16]Oh God.
[201:10.02]No.
[201:48.88]They're just beating the shit out of my face.
[202:30.22]No!
[202:39.21]Oh shit, it depends on who has the most.
[202:40.77]How do I?
[202:41.09]Okay, I'm just going to just explode.
[202:42.19]Just float, float, float, float, float.
[202:44.57]I'm just going to float.
[202:45.73]I'm going to conserve all my energy.
[202:49.56]Why did I die?
[203:12.50]Oh, I couldn't turn around fast enough.
[203:17.62]That's a good one too.
[203:18.36]This is goofy, I like it.
[203:32.49]Get to throw them off the submarine.
[203:33.77]I threw that guy off the submarine three or four times.
[203:44.22]The shame corner, yeah.
[203:54.59]Late night stream.
[203:56.35]Uh, kinda, yeah.
[203:57.81]I'm 0-0 late.
[203:58.11]I'll just run like that.
[204:02.28]430.
[204:05.74]I probably will do more later streams, like late night.
[204:13.26]I know EU does not want to hear that, but... I don't want to start too, too late.
[204:34.33]But around this time is alright.
[204:35.45]Somewhere between like 4 and 7, 4 and 6 Pacific.
[204:44.72]Alright, what am I going to do here?
[204:54.22]How long is the Resident Evil 4 DLC?
[205:01.12]It's football?
[205:02.64]Oh, this is so... Can we pass it?
[205:04.12]You have to get a touchdown?
[205:08.61]This is so cool.
[205:11.13]Alright, I wish we could play baseball.
[205:51.58]I got it.
[205:52.52]I have it.
[205:53.07]I have the ball.
[205:55.41]I have the ball.
[205:56.27]There we go.
[206:07.18]About five to six hours.
[206:08.32]Okay.
[206:27.49]Oh, this is free.
[206:30.69]I think that's so much faster.
[206:47.39]There.
[206:47.57]Good good good good.
[207:00.52]Good throw.
[207:01.04]Good throw.
[207:02.81]Oh.
[207:07.55]Oh, no.
[207:07.89]Stamina.
[207:16.55]No.
[207:35.51]Oh, it's not.
[207:37.05]Wow.
[207:40.35]What just happened?
[208:04.79]Do goals not work anymore?
[208:26.77]You have to be holding the ball.
[208:28.65]Oh shoot.
[208:34.17]Okay, I get it.
[209:09.06]The Yoshi character just takes it every time.
[209:14.65]That Yoshi character just picks it up and runs every time.
[209:17.09]Okay, I'm not going anywhere.
[209:25.95]This Gumby character just put it in there.
[209:29.70]His name is Prickle.
[210:02.45]Where's, where's, where's... Pass it!
[210:23.35]Alright, somebody just touch it!
[210:37.33]Give me this ball.
[210:40.21]No, no, no, no.
[210:57.34]Oh, he's going to run away with it.
[211:00.86]It's a good attempt.
[211:04.00]Nice try.
[211:15.13]Your teammate knocks you out like six times.
[211:16.87]Yeah.
[211:17.67]This is the way it is.
[211:18.29]It's fine.
[211:19.01]Alright.
[211:33.56]Good, good, good.
[211:34.44]Don't let it roll down.
[211:36.03]Nice.
[211:37.67]Okay.
[211:37.87]We're in the game.
[211:53.63]Matt is helping somebody with their math homework.
[211:59.99]I would not take math homework advice from chat.
[212:09.42]You're going to end up on a different continent.
[212:29.36]Alright, we're back in this.
[212:31.24]If you throw it, I'll get it.
[212:47.40]I just want to get it down.
[213:02.18]Out of 15 people.
[213:05.02]How did I hit him right in the forehead?
[213:06.76]Uh-oh.
[213:20.04]We're still in it.
[213:20.50]Oops.
[213:25.53]You get that ball down here and I'm going to run away with it.
[213:28.17]Somebody just toss it down here and I got it.
[213:30.61]Get it down here.
[213:31.09]You can do it.
[213:44.57]That's their MVP right there.
[214:04.79]I wanna get in the picture!
[214:18.34]The F-Zero update came out right now.
[214:19.72]I feel like that's a lie.
[214:36.61]It's true.
[214:37.17]I was trying so hard.
[214:46.06]doing the practice game.
[214:48.70]I want to do this.
[214:49.66]Please, somebody vote for this.
[214:52.06]No one's doing it.
[214:54.62]Everybody picks the soccer or football ones.
[214:58.40]That looks like trivia.
[214:59.26]Is it some kind of trivia?
[215:12.33]I want to see it.
[215:18.61]Alright, we need a new.
[215:19.79]New fit here.
[215:21.01]What do I tell you?
[215:47.55]How is Otto?
[215:49.52]Otto's doing good.
[215:50.16]He needs to get his teeth cleaned.
[215:51.88]I'm going to get him hooked up for that.
[215:58.38]He needs a dental appointment.
[216:02.27]This game's pretty loud.
[216:06.25]It is kind of loud.
[216:11.75]You're right.
[216:33.92]You're quiet too.
[216:36.72]That might be... I'm leaning back quite a bit, so that's probably why.
[216:43.03]This new setup, I'll make sure I got to get it a little bit more.
[216:48.31]The word I'm looking for is complete.
[216:50.29]Getting rolled.
[216:57.32]This is not good.
[217:14.21]oh you have the ball alright okay okay okay okay good nice wait did you score on our own goal wait I'm confused what just happened
[217:42.39]You're red.
[217:51.97]We're not very good at this.
[217:58.20]I'm staying all the way back because they just keep barreling through everybody and just OK.
[218:09.30]I'm staying back here.
[218:14.62]Yeah, I know this bullshit.
[218:15.70]I know this bullshit tactic.
[218:27.47]Get out of here.
[218:32.17]I tried.
[218:43.03]What back brace were you using for your VR streams?
[218:46.39]Um, I kind of flip-flopped between just an abdominal band that I would wear.
[218:55.82]Kind of on the upper part of my abdomen.
[218:59.46]I don't remember the brand, though.
[219:00.69]I think it was just like an abdominal band.
[219:04.95]Not tight, just kind of there.
[219:11.67]Are you making shit up?
[219:12.47]Nope.
[219:13.85]Uh, the VR streams.
[219:16.41]I have like a jet pack on, on some of them.
[219:20.73]I used to wear a brace for my chest.
[219:22.43]It was like a intercostal pain chest piece.
[219:27.46]It was okay, but it became pretty clear that it was putting a little too much pressure on my body and wearing something like that for three, four, five, six, seven hours sometimes was like, ah, this, I should not be doing this.
[219:43.46]No, no, I'm quitting.
[219:45.57]I'm rage quitting.
[219:46.15]I don't want to play soccer again.
[219:47.09]How are you doing now?
[220:05.28]It's still there, but... Eh, it's alright.
[220:16.21]Pick a map for the main menu, maybe.
[220:30.81]Stretch before.
[220:31.73]Yeah, so.
[220:34.30]Not to get into it again for the millionth time, but.
[220:39.85]I just realistically have to go just do hernia surgery.
[220:45.59]I think that's really what it is.
[220:46.91]And I said that like a year or two ago and I just never did it.
[220:53.60]But that might not even be the problem.
[220:56.70]The last doctor I went to that I had an upper endoscopy, they were like, yeah, you have a hiatal hernia, but it really shouldn't be causing those problems.
[221:05.58]Like, oh, oh shit.
[221:12.57]And then you kind of start convincing yourself.
[221:14.07]No, it has to be that.
[221:14.99]No, it has to be.
[221:16.83]It's nothing else.
[221:20.35]Get in there.
[221:31.40]But I'm good.
[221:32.24]I'm good.
[221:32.50]I would tell you if I wasn't.
[221:34.88]I was pretty transparent about it a few years ago.
[221:41.47]Just managing it.
[221:43.09]And then maybe I'll just go in and get surgery done to see if it does anything.
[221:49.94]It was officially costochondritis.
[221:52.68]But I don't know.
[221:54.04]I don't know if I agree with that.
[221:59.81]I don't know.
[222:17.23]I want to play... I want to hit people with shovels.
[222:19.33]I don't want to play soccer.
[222:22.85]This has 100% less shovel gameplay.
[222:38.06]Would it be you're just old?
[222:40.86]Maybe.
[222:41.14]I mean, that would be kind of weird because this started... Man, it's been a while.
[222:46.60]It's been a long time now.
[222:51.56]I remember telling doctors being like, oh, yeah, it's been going on for like two or three years now.
[222:56.27]And that was 2019, 2020, right?
[223:02.02]It's weird how you kind of just get used to something and then just try to not let it dominate your entire life.
[223:11.16]And don't get me wrong, I am fine.
[223:13.10]Like this is not like debilitating at all.
[223:15.24]It's just there.
[223:20.41]It can get a little rough sometimes if I sit a certain way or I kind of stand up for too long or sit for too long.
[223:28.49]Just had hernia surgery three weeks ago.
[223:33.29]I hope it fixes whatever is going on with you.
[223:38.82]No, don't do it.
[223:41.12]This dude eats goat cheese, definitely.
[223:57.31]I do.
[224:08.25]I like the bear that went to the left.
[224:10.72]I love that I want one of those.
[224:15.72]Oops.
[224:15.98]I wish there was a dance.
[224:34.18]Oh no.
[224:42.84]If you had to eat a whole frozen stick of butter in 30 minutes, how would you do it?
[224:48.00]Uh... I wouldn't.
[224:52.54]But if I had to... If I had to... I'd probably just melt it down and drink it.
[224:59.95]That seems the least awful way.
[225:09.10]What's the stipulation here?
[225:09.94]Do I have to eat it whole or can I put it in something?
[225:13.14]But I just have a wicked gross fettuccine Alfredo that has like a ton of butter in it.
[225:18.35]Fettuccine Alfredo already has a stick of butter in it.
[225:21.28]So I'll just eat some fettuccine Alfredo.
[225:23.24]I think I've solved your conundrum.
[225:40.91]I feel like I'm not doing anything, but I also feel like I'm doing a lot.
[225:44.59]Just by being a presence back here.
[225:54.38]See?
[225:56.08]We won.
[225:56.45]I did not play.
[226:07.89]Prove you can make fettuccine Alfredo.
[226:09.79]I don't need.
[226:10.25]I don't know how to make fettuccine Alfredo.
[226:11.63]I don't know, butter.
[226:15.20]Shredded cheese, flour, water.
[226:18.56]I don't even know what's in fettuccine Alfredo.
[226:23.24]I know it's like cream, cream, butter, salt, garlic.
[226:32.94]Libraju.
[226:43.11]You know what I had?
[226:44.90]Oh, man.
[226:46.60]So my mother made this for me.
[226:48.92]If you didn't know, I was visiting with my mother the other way around.
[226:54.54]And my mother made... It's great to see her, by the way.
[227:00.24]It's been a while.
[227:02.85]She tries to make the trip every year or two.
[227:07.32]But it was wonderful.
[227:08.88]She taught me how to make a poached egg.
[227:10.94]Because I've tried a million times and I can't do it.
[227:15.57]But a poached egg on a piece of toast.
[227:19.63]Jammy in the middle.
[227:22.35]Forget about it.
[227:28.03]That's the worst egg?
[227:29.33]Oh no, no, you just haven't had it made right.
[227:33.04]Trust me, I've had poached eggs that were just disgusting boogers.
[227:38.16]I get it.
[227:39.32]But a good poached egg, I think is probably the best kind of egg.
[227:44.12]But they're just so annoying to make.
[227:45.16]It's really easy to mess them up.
[227:46.79]Alright, we're going gorilla.
[227:54.19]Take a piece of toast.
[227:57.50]Or two.
[227:58.50]Two pieces of toast.
[227:59.98]Butter the toast.
[228:02.36]Nice and buttery.
[228:04.34]Drop that egg, that poached egg, right on top.
[228:07.08]And just start carving it out with a fork and knife and eating it like steak.
[228:14.07]So, so good.
[228:26.53]I'm putting these in the right side, right?
[228:27.79]This is not the wrong way, is it?
[228:51.98]Yeah, my mother talked about the vinegar, the things that the word the vinegar trick.
[228:59.61]Yeah, poached eggs get really stringy, but if you add vinegar to the water, just a tiny bit, it makes it so it doesn't get so stringy.
[229:08.33]I'm trying.
[229:16.64]I'm trying to get him up here.
[229:22.24]He's faking his accent.
[229:24.06]What?
[229:25.41]What accent?
[229:27.33]He's faking his accent?
[229:30.15]What am I doing?
[229:31.39]What am I doing?
[229:33.41]I'm not aware of it, whatever it is.
[229:34.77]What did I do?
[229:35.43]What did I say?
[229:35.85]Am I faking it?
[229:42.34]I don't know.
[229:42.78]I'm not even aware of the word.
[229:45.88]He just got exposed.
[229:46.78]I don't even know what you mean.
[229:47.86]What word did I say?
[229:50.46]Mother.
[229:52.30]Oh, but that's just how you say it.
[230:06.55]Oh, are you referring to what I just said?
[230:08.23]Forget about it?
[230:10.23]Yeah, that was a little weird.
[230:11.35]I agree.
[230:27.30]Oh, look at that pig!
[230:39.66]You do feel more powerful when you're the gorilla.
[230:42.02]Confirmed.
[230:44.86]Where are you taking it?
[230:54.57]Get it through the door.
[230:59.99]Get that pig!
[231:03.91]I gotta get this pig.
[231:13.10]Oh my goodness.
[231:14.72]Oh my god.
[231:16.32]I ruined everything.
[231:25.41]Whoa.
[231:25.73]We are moving with this now.
[231:27.31]Holy shit.
[231:28.27]We're on point.
[231:30.57]Pull it.
[231:34.24]There we go.
[231:35.62]Nice.
[231:36.46]We moved.
[231:37.98]We went so quick.
[231:54.40]Oh, I almost had it.
[231:56.86]Level 11.
[231:59.65]Got more cookies?
[232:01.53]That pig was a bat.
[232:03.97]Oh.
[232:07.07]Okay.
[232:10.89]Watching.
[232:12.01]Bacon and cookies.
[232:13.29]12,000.
[232:17.15]I don't really want this stuff though.
[232:20.83]This one's kind of cool.
[232:22.32]Yeah, I'll get this one.
[232:28.25]You're not saying it in the right voice.
[232:29.81]Yeah.
[232:35.04]True.
[232:38.14]Cookies!
[232:40.56]There you go.
[232:55.91]Oh, did you mean the Mario version?
[233:03.20]Oh, you got both.
[233:03.78]How far do you dunk your cookie in milk?
[233:13.13]I've never seen this one.
[233:15.97]I thought that said butthole lab.
[233:21.51]Uh, stay away from the black hole and stay alive.
[233:29.56]So you take the cookie, if it's an Oreo or if it's a chocolate chip, doesn't matter.
[233:34.86]You just dunk it halfway.
[233:37.13]Count to 10.
[233:38.75]Take it out.
[233:39.57]Tap, tap.
[233:41.07]Bite.
[233:49.82]Yeah, that's a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[233:51.12]Pull it out.
[234:01.20]I want it soft, but I don't want it to be mushy.
[234:06.92]How incompetent do you think we are?
[234:08.74]No, everyone has... That's not what I said.
[234:10.82]Somebody asked how I dip my cookies in milk.
[234:13.94]I didn't say every single person needs to do it like this, or you're stupid.
[234:19.02]But you are, if you don't.
[234:31.60]One omega LOL in a sea of D faces Hey, hey, hey, hey you and me get it.
[234:38.65]Hey you and me get it.
[234:40.21]You know what I mean?
[234:51.17]This is a cool skin, I like it Alright, don't go in the black hole
[235:26.91]Am I doing it right?
[235:27.77]I think I just broke my neck.
[235:33.83]Is he alright?
[235:34.33]Uh oh.
[235:39.41]I think I might be wedged in this.
[235:46.63]Shh, don't tell him.
[235:48.11]I think I just automatically won the game.
[235:57.80]I think I'm stuck in here.
[236:00.44]Am I?
[236:03.52]Something is wedged here and I can't really figure it out.
[236:06.29]Oh, I was stuck in the... No, maybe I wasn't.
[236:09.77]That was weird.
[236:10.27]I couldn't move.
[236:17.78]Oh, that's what just happened.
[236:31.00]Everybody's a gorilla.
[236:31.62]Oh, that was an amazing shot.
[236:37.30]It was mid-air.
[236:38.18]I mean, strategy is obviously grab the cane.
[237:02.17]They feel about just straight up milk.
[237:03.75]Sometimes people treat me like I'm the devil for drinking milk.
[237:08.23]You do whatever you want.
[237:11.85]You should do... Eat.
[237:13.85]You should care about whatever you want to care about.
[237:17.57]Like things you like.
[237:23.97]Somebody says it's gross that you drink almond milk or something.
[237:28.67]Or regular milk or oat milk.
[237:33.44]Okay.
[237:48.66]about the milk that I like it's almost like I like almond milk well almond milk is bad oh regular milk regular milk is bad too oh what about um oat milk oat milk sucks it's bad it's really bad everything's bad uh uh rice milk soy milk
[238:25.98]I just want my coffee to taste a little creamier.
[238:34.69]I've somehow made it all the way.
[238:39.41]Oat milk is good, but it depends on the brand.
[238:40.83]Yeah, I like oat milk right now.
[238:42.17]I think oat milk tastes the best out of all of them.
[238:53.35]I almost just missed and went over the edge.
[238:55.39]That would have been so funny.
[239:00.33]Where's the chain?
[239:00.99]It's over here, isn't it?
[239:05.26]That's bad.
[239:06.10]I didn't even get anything.
[239:07.74]I got this guy though.
[239:08.62]Alright, we're good.
[239:17.11]No, that's my friend!
[239:29.49]It's just a cat and three gorillas.
[239:32.03]Why do I feel like they're on the same team even though they're not?
[239:43.67]No, get away.
[239:44.31]It's mine.
[239:46.01]Mine.
[239:47.81]He just knocked me out.
[239:50.55]You better hold on to me.
[239:52.57]You better hold on to me this whole time.
[240:14.52]I love Macha.
[240:15.22]I just wanted to call him a freak.
[240:19.88]Macha's great too.
[240:27.75]Oooooof.
[240:29.39]Well, we have to even the odds.
[240:34.31]Is that gonna hit him?
[240:35.71]It skimmed right over his head.
[240:49.38]How long have we gone without talking about milk?
[240:54.64]Don't you guys feel like it's sometimes it's like once every two weeks.
[241:04.57]Bro, you just absolute.
[241:07.25]You know what?
[241:09.23]Yeah, there you go.
[241:11.33]There you go, yep.
[241:17.23]I'm gonna hit somebody right in the head.
[241:19.89]What team am I on?
[241:21.55]OK, I'm on yellow.
[241:26.70]Well, you stream once every two weeks, so yeah.
[241:29.38]We just talk about milk every single time I'm live.
[241:34.46]Please say, oh, milk.
[241:36.02]Almond milk.
[241:44.39]I'm going to be such a bastard here.
[241:50.35]I want to avoid hitting you.
[242:00.95]Oh, that's going to be so sad.
[242:03.93]Is it going to get anybody now?
[242:05.78]Stop engaging in the conversation.
[242:19.19]I like that conversation is fun.
[242:23.21]But also to something to keep in mind, how many people here?
[242:26.81]It's very possible that.
[242:30.25]There's like 11,000, like 10,000 or whatever.
[242:32.79]Oh shit.
[242:33.53]I just clicked back into the window and threw the bomb into the trash.
[242:36.77]Alright, so if there's 10,000 people here, it's very possible that this 10,000 people is a different 10,000 people next time.
[242:46.08]And the time after that, it could be like another 10,000 different people.
[242:53.68]Everyone's not all here at the same exact time at the same exact stream.
[243:06.58]So if we talk about oat milk,
[243:38.00]Oh, what?
[243:48.28]No, give it to me.
[243:53.87]Aha.
[243:56.59]That's a win right there.
[243:57.45]At least it should be.
[243:59.87]They come up already.
[244:09.23]Why did that explode?
[244:16.97]OK.
[244:20.33]Are you high?
[244:21.08]No.
[244:23.18]I'm just chilling man.
[244:24.26]Hey, I've done that a million times before.
[244:36.56]I know how it feels.
[244:44.18]Dude, don't there you doing it on purpose?
[244:49.46]Of course they are.
[244:50.40]How would it be on accident?
[245:08.48]You're just dropping people left and right this.
[245:24.38]Am I holding it?
[245:26.10]He's holding it with one hand.
[245:27.58]Why?
[245:27.94]Put both hands on it, please.
[245:38.47]Oh, you're getting dunked.
[245:43.65]Hey, we did it.
[246:02.68]On the ground again.
[246:18.39]Milk and Pepsi.
[246:19.23]I drank the milk on stream.
[246:22.49]It was weird, but it was okay.
[246:24.69]I would never drink it again, but I wouldn't spit it out.
[246:36.87]I love Pilk.
[246:37.47]Hashtag Pilk fan.
[246:42.91]If we have an opportunity, please vote for that one.
[246:45.41]One person voted for that.
[246:47.93]One person voted for it and we're going there.
[246:51.33]Two of us voted on the right one.
[247:01.92]Everybody wants to play sports.
[247:03.74]I just want to beat people up with shovels.
[247:30.05]I need to read this because I don't know what it is.
[247:33.65]Oh, no.
[247:34.21]Okay, never mind.
[247:37.49]What just hit me?
[247:38.55]Oh, it was the puck.
[247:50.52]Alright.
[247:51.44]And... There it is.
[247:53.02]No!
[247:53.98]There's a cow.
[247:55.76]I love that.
[247:57.21]I want that.
[248:02.13]That's the best skin in the whole game.
[248:16.02]It's just so perfect.
[248:29.21]Big fat orange cat is cool too.
[248:46.19]God.
[248:53.63]That was a good block.
[248:55.54]It was good.
[249:01.58]Damn it.
[249:02.36]If I was lined up right there, I was just a little to the left.
[249:06.07]Okay.
[249:15.89]Oh, it's perfect for somebody to get it.
[249:18.81]It's right there.
[249:19.50]Look.
[249:30.21]Set me up.
[249:30.81]Set me up.
[249:32.51]Damn it.
[249:45.17]I think I'm going to get an opportunity right.
[250:09.88]Ouch.
[250:20.19]Do not.
[250:23.63]Wow, I thought that went in.
[250:48.76]This is a pretty good game so far.
[251:18.11]Sorry, not sorry.
[251:20.59]Racist.
[251:23.25]Let me tell you something about racism.
[251:29.08]Mean Geno.
[251:31.30]I'm trying.
[251:33.54]I had it first.
[251:37.95]Macho Man is a voice that if you can do it, you can sometimes do it for like three seconds and then it just turns into something else.
[251:54.95]Yeah, let me tell you something.
[251:59.45]Let me... Macho man Randy said... I'm trying to do a voice.
[252:10.63]Don't punch me.
[252:26.26]They'll just never be another Macho Man Randy Savage.
[252:28.76]There's a lot of those guys that just... They'll never be another one.
[252:32.06]Ever again.
[252:32.96]Ever.
[252:33.10]Alright, I want to get lined up.
[252:49.17]This cow is a good goalie.
[252:50.63]We gotta get that shield away from you.
[252:53.29]Right now.
[253:04.42]A lot of you might not know this, but... You know the way that I talk sometimes, where I talk like this?
[253:09.96]Emphasizing a lot of the W's?
[253:12.20]That's Mean Gene Okerlund.
[253:14.48]Mean Gene Okerlund was a huge, huge influence on, like, voice stuff.
[253:20.07]He had this incredibly particular way of talking.
[253:26.06]He was a master at it.
[253:27.00]You just did it in your own goal.
[253:29.92]Oh, sorry.
[253:33.41]Oops.
[253:38.85]I'll make up for it right now.
[254:02.76]Get up.
[254:04.28]What?
[254:04.94]Oh, I thought we got a goal because he put the shield in his own goal.
[254:11.71]That's weird.
[254:15.57]Set me up.
[254:15.93]Set me up.
[254:16.29]Set me up.
[254:16.71]Set me up.
[254:17.15]Set me up.
[254:21.76]I'll be goalie.
[254:22.18]That's fine.
[254:38.31]I keep getting clocked by this thing every time.
[254:49.52]That's a beautiful setup.
[254:52.03]Oh, yes.
[254:53.97]There we go.
[255:03.19]I haven't seen him contribute in any way.
[255:05.55]You must have just came to the stream because I'm the one that got the first goal and it was a beautiful shot.
[255:11.14]Like this.
[255:21.06]Hi.
[255:21.56]Oh, no, we won.
[255:25.87]He was the team's clown.
[255:26.81]Yeah, I have to entertain everybody in the goal.
[255:41.80]Finally got my face in a picture.
[255:52.43]No more sports, more shovel.
[255:53.85]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[256:06.99]You always feel the compulsive need to entertain everybody.
[256:12.60]I think that just comes with not being able to sit still.
[256:16.58]So talking a lot is a way to expel a lot of energy.
[256:26.02]Which I usually have a lot of.
[256:27.61]Maybe not so much anymore.
[256:29.97]But I still do.
[256:32.87]10 years ago, 15 years ago, I was just a ball of just energy that had to constantly be doing something or talking or moving or
[256:41.31]I've definitely mellowed out a lot in the last five years, I'd say.
[256:45.31]Without a doubt.
[257:04.76]We were mellow yellow.
[257:08.62]Uh... I...
[257:10.99]Do I?
[257:11.15]Wait a minute.
[257:15.57]That's a soda, right?
[257:16.25]Is it a drink?
[257:22.34]Just block them all.
[257:24.80]That's a great strategy.
[257:28.40]Make it so they can't get over here.
[257:40.47]I have no stamina.
[257:43.31]How are we holding hands backwards behind?
[257:46.66]That was very strange.
[257:49.80]God damn it.
[257:54.18]This Mountain Dew for boring people?
[257:55.96]I didn't even mean to do that and I hit my own teammate.
[258:03.33]No, I didn't.
[258:03.67]Okay, I'm on green this time.
[258:10.89]Mellow Yellow is boring?
[258:13.91]I feel like that's the opposite because wouldn't Mountain Dew be the default and that's just the one to get because it's Mountain Dew because it's everywhere and it's the popular one?
[258:22.35]Mellow Yellow to me is, no, we don't got Mountain Dew.
[258:25.45]We got Mellow Yellow.
[258:27.31]It's like, whoa, interesting.
[258:28.61]You've got, I haven't seen that in a while.
[258:31.07]That's like having squirt in your fridge.
[258:37.83]It's like, oh shit, you've got, you've got squirt?
[258:43.09]I would have thought it would have been a sprite.
[258:57.21]I'm sorry.
[259:01.59]Oh, whatever.
[259:02.31]I don't care.
[259:03.63]I don't even care.
[259:04.91]I don't care.
[259:06.37]Oh, shit.
[259:20.03]Oh, that was very embarrassing, but it's okay.
[259:31.72]I just forgot to hold right trigger to grab onto the ledge.
[259:35.48]I just bit my teeth off the ledge.
[259:54.06]Squirt is a good soda.
[259:55.68]One of the best.
[260:03.34]OK.
[260:08.41]Not messing around this time.
[260:23.94]Wow, nice.
[260:25.26]Ooh, a tiger skin.
[260:30.28]There are a lot more models in this game than I thought there were going to be.
[260:33.75]Highlord Tyrion Fordring needs you, champion.
[260:44.51]The Lich King must be stopped.
[260:50.58]Yeah, I also can sit in Dalaran for 60 minutes a day and hear that like two or three times.
[261:11.93]One shot, one shot, one shot to get up.
[261:13.51]Please get up.
[261:14.23]One shot.
[261:20.85]You're gonna get us both killed.
[261:21.77]You're gonna get us both killed.
[261:33.92]Who's your favorite Dragon Ball Z character?
[261:37.28]Who's the one that goes like this?
[261:48.37]Boo, that's right.
[261:49.75]That's the one.
[261:52.32]I'm alive, right?
[262:09.83]I'm holding it.
[262:11.35]Not Mr. Satan.
[262:12.21]No, it's not Boo.
[262:12.89]I don't give a shit about Boo at all.
[262:13.99]I just thought it'd be funny to do that for five seconds.
[262:15.92]Uh, it's Mr. Satan.
[262:28.30]It's not Mr. Satan.
[262:29.54]I just like that voice, so I say it's my favorite character, but it's actually Beerus.
[262:37.03]Fuck that guy.
[262:37.75]It's Goku.
[262:38.15]You know what I mean?
[262:51.49]And that's how you tell everybody your top four favorite DBZ characters.
[263:02.38]He's on the wiki looking at them all.
[263:05.42]In the beginning of the stream, I told you I was lying down.
[263:08.53]I don't have Wikipedia over here.
[263:11.97]I'm lying in one of those beanbag chair, upright chair things on the ground.
[263:20.54]I don't got Wikipedia up.
[263:26.96]You lost viewers for that?
[263:28.20]Oh, they weren't strong enough.
[263:40.90]I thought you were going to punch me, but you didn't.
[263:42.42]So I'm not going to punch you.
[263:43.66]Look at that tiger.
[263:48.42]That's so sad.
[263:50.14]That's so sad.
[263:52.75]He made it?
[263:57.25]What?
[263:58.33]I just knocked myself out?
[264:08.90]I'm... I was trying to... Okay.
[264:12.15]I did not know that could happen.
[264:16.55]Dropkick.
[264:28.20]You got styled on.
[264:29.93]I did, you're right.
[264:39.75]I got a shot.
[264:47.48]Oh, now you're all in trouble.
[264:52.17]That was my friend, but it's OK.
[264:53.55]It's not here yet.
[265:14.77]Please lift that up.
[265:17.35]Don't leave me hanging.
[265:19.45]Keep it up.
[265:28.07]Thank you.
[265:31.33]Oof.
[265:34.40]Oh, we got a 2v1 scenario, don't we?
[265:36.16]No?
[265:42.82]Did I die?
[265:46.59]I'm dead.
[265:47.23]I didn't even know that was possible.
[266:06.22]That alligator is so fucked up right now.
[266:18.42]Stop!
[266:29.37]Somebody has to pull the lever.
[266:32.21]I'll do it.
[266:54.54]My buddy's still here.
[267:09.12]Oh, shit.
[267:10.58]Don't.
[267:16.32]What?
[267:16.60]It break?
[267:17.34]It...
[267:25.73]It broke!
[267:28.75]Why am I getting the Three Stooges shit happening to me all the time?
[267:43.19]Alright, that's not a bad photo.
[267:48.68]Preferred brand of vacuum cleaner.
[267:50.32]Uh, a stick vacuum.
[267:51.76]Gonna have to plug it in.
[267:53.46]I'm a mover.
[267:57.73]I'm like a cellar spider when I vacuum.
[267:59.45]I'm just all over the place.
[268:02.69]I'll start in the corner in one room.
[268:04.19]I'll just walk to the other room and just go in the other room.
[268:07.15]In the bedroom.
[268:08.65]One, two, three.
[268:09.39]Just walk across the fucking hall.
[268:10.87]Just go across to the other room.
[268:13.44]In the bathroom.
[268:14.24]Just zooming around with a stick vacuum.
[268:19.84]Because when you don't have a stick vacuum...
[268:26.52]You end up having, you're tethered to the plug.
[268:30.28]Vacuum a whole room with a plug in the wall.
[268:31.68]And Austin is like, yeah, I got to unplug this.
[268:34.71]Pick this up.
[268:35.57]It's kind of heavy.
[268:36.43]I got a bag.
[268:37.25]I got to move to another room.
[268:39.03]Where's an outlet?
[268:40.37]Am I going to have the problem where I vacuum too far where the outlet can't reach?
[268:45.20]And there's just one strip that is just never done because I just don't care about the vacuum can't go that far.
[268:52.70]Stick vacuum.
[269:03.13]Add coal into the furnace to speed up your train.
[269:05.39]Okay.
[269:10.31]Bro, what's the brand?
[269:11.29]We don't want to rant.
[269:13.67]Um... I had a Dyson stick vacuum, but I broke it.
[269:25.56]Having a Dyson is like... It's like a Cadillac.
[269:30.54]I don't want to get another one because what if I break that one?
[269:32.56]They're very expensive.
[269:39.69]One of my friends came over one time and they thought I had one of those standing hand sanitizers in the corner of the room.
[269:47.61]They were like, why do you have a big hand sanitizer?
[269:51.10]I was like, that's not what that is.
[269:56.50]It does kind of look like one.
[269:59.34]It looks like a big standing hand sanitizer.
[270:03.50]He was like, I was going to go over and put my hand underneath it.
[270:05.32]I thought you were a fucking weirdo for a second, but it's a vacuum.
[270:24.47]What train am I putting this in?
[270:36.95]I never played this one before.
[270:45.85]Holy shit.
[270:52.74]Alright, drop it.
[270:53.86]That was a big one too.
[270:54.70]This one was huge.
[270:55.50]Let's go.
[271:09.28]Put him in the furnace!
[271:25.68]That was a bad idea.
[271:40.15]Damn it.
[271:42.75]Alright, they're ahead of us.
[271:43.59]Forget about that guy.
[271:44.45]He's just going to troll us.
[272:00.66]Okay.
[272:05.08]What does this do?
[272:20.30]Is it the gas?
[272:28.95]I didn't know if you had to heat it up.
[272:32.51]Why would you break?
[272:33.99]Oh, but why?
[272:35.90]Oh, I get it.
[272:36.86]I was saying, why is there a lever on?
[272:45.66]I get it.
[272:45.97]I get it.
[272:46.23]I get it.
[272:46.43]Alright, we're going to be fine.
[272:54.32]Oh my God, you are shit face.
[272:55.78]Just get it in.
[273:08.07]I'm so sad.
[273:18.29]I'm an anchor right now.
[273:22.34]Dude.
[273:31.74]Misjudged the jump just a little.
[273:45.31]Steal this too.
[273:46.03]Oh, give me the shovel.
[273:58.65]We're winning.
[274:04.36]That was such an annoying distraction.
[274:05.66]We won.
[274:05.98]I hit my head.
[274:26.04]Fuck you!
[274:31.16]We did it.
[274:31.82]Oops.
[274:42.77]Way there.
[274:43.29]We're getting by a mile.
[275:00.67]I got it.
[275:01.93]Yes.
[275:03.43]I want that one.
[275:08.78]I got it.
[275:15.07]I did not think I was going to be playing this for almost five hours, but it's really fun.
[275:29.72]How do you feel about boiled peanuts?
[275:32.50]I don't know.
[275:32.90]If I've ever had them, I don't really know I ate them.
[275:38.28]What are they in usually?
[275:55.07]You just eat them by themselves?
[275:59.97]I don't think I've ever had it before.
[276:06.91]So do you take the peanuts out of the shells?
[276:09.11]Or is it in the shells?
[276:10.82]And then you take them out.
[276:17.28]In the shells, okay.
[276:22.72]No, wait, you take them out?
[276:23.48]Okay.
[276:28.95]How long do you boil them in the shells for in water?
[276:35.66]They're so good.
[276:42.50]Seven hours?
[276:44.92]You do it for a couple of what?
[276:48.20]You boil them for hours?
[276:49.78]I kind of am interested in this, though.
[277:01.62]So not you just talk about like on the stovetop.
[277:04.08]I feel like that would be.
[277:14.91]Be coming crazy.
[277:17.85]Rockpot will do it now.
[277:22.55]On low heat.
[277:25.87]We take care of this guy.
[277:33.19]This person just had a bunch of groceries in their hands.
[277:35.95]That was so sad.
[277:36.95]This is one of those games where you just giggle.
[277:44.41]Wait, you mean I can smash somebody's head with this?
[277:53.85]We gotta go, you gotta, we gotta shove it in.
[277:57.66]Just kick it in, kick it, punch it.
[278:09.94]How do you do emotes?
[278:10.54]There we go.
[278:10.90]That was weird.
[278:12.09]It was like I was trying to press left stick, right stick.
[278:15.53]I was so lucky that we got this immediate spawn.
[278:20.39]The other team is AFK.
[278:21.78]Oh, that's sad.
[278:37.95]Alright.
[278:39.65]Good job.
[278:46.34]You didn't have to go in two.
[278:54.48]Let him get one gumdrop.
[278:56.79]We can't just take them all.
[279:11.04]We got the perfect placement on this, too.
[279:14.50]This is the way to do it.
[279:24.67]Eh, they were AFK.
[279:35.55]Oh, I just won a quick match without being knocked out.
[279:41.61]I don't even know where I am.
[279:47.96]Oh, I got money.
[279:49.64]Let's open up one of those surprise eggs. 200.
[280:13.50]So if I... 1080.
[280:16.21]I feel like that's going to take a while.
[280:18.99]Yeah.
[280:31.42]I want one now.
[280:36.10]Screen.
[280:36.52]What is it?
[280:36.84]Is that like epic or something?
[280:41.59]Cute.
[280:54.39]Ink Sparky.
[281:00.67]Uncommon.
[281:04.67]Dark Ancient Underbite.
[281:11.09]Okay.
[281:17.82]Don't I already have this?
[281:18.52]I want to see those ones.
[281:21.10]What were those?
[281:26.77]Dark Uga.
[281:41.01]Okay, but could you beat Goku, though?
[281:42.89]Yes.
[281:43.13]I 100%, I 100% could beat Goku.
[281:45.59]At rock, paper, scissors.
[281:46.37]Maybe.
[282:04.38]Spend five grand on skins?
[282:06.54]No.
[282:10.04]Can you even use real money?
[282:20.57]You can?
[282:20.85]Alright, I got some cool stuff.
[282:30.61]What did I get?
[282:33.84]I got a melon hat.
[282:38.22]How do I change outfit?
[282:40.24]Oh, there we go.
[282:41.40]Melon hat for... Let's do that one.
[282:54.81]I mean, maybe I get a little bit of the in-game currency, but I'm going to spend $5,000. $5,000.
[283:02.90]That's too much.
[283:14.14]How did we fuck that up?
[283:16.74]How did we screw that up?
[283:19.26]I was going to say that was three knuckleheads.
[283:32.67]Yeah, I think the game's definitely worth it.
[283:38.63]Especially if you have a group of friends.
[283:42.03]This is one of those ultimate party games.
[283:50.50]And the variety is there.
[283:51.54]I thought this was going to be four maps or so.
[283:54.36]I was completely wrong.
[284:00.68]And...
[284:03.64]Yeah, it's on.
[284:05.36]I thought that was one of my teammates pissed that I kept trying to grab the ball.
[284:20.89]Somebody get it in there.
[284:23.85]It's on Game Pass.
[284:24.93]That's right.
[284:27.43]Ace Attorney is coming to Game Pass.
[284:28.70]You have no excuse now.
[284:30.10]Okay.
[284:32.10]Troop.
[284:42.88]That's true.
[284:43.38]Kind of running away with it here.
[284:59.65]Don't tease me like that.
[285:00.71]I'll play.
[285:08.10]I'm definitely not going to play the whole series.
[285:09.76]I'm not going to do all of them.
[285:14.82]I'll try one or two cases.
[285:17.80]Because I don't know how much I like those games.
[285:21.69]Genuinely.
[285:29.79]I've never played one.
[285:35.09]I have downloaded them on four separate devices over the course of ten years.
[285:42.06]But I haven't played it.
[285:44.61]I know, it's weird.
[285:49.60]I've gotten it on iPad.
[285:51.70]On Steam.
[285:53.70]On... What was the... PS4.
[286:00.07]I buy it every single console generation with the intent that I'm going to play it.
[286:04.63]And I just don't.
[286:17.69]They're not great stream games.
[286:20.09]Yeah.
[286:21.85]But I mean, I got a new philosophy anyways, right?
[286:24.73]Doesn't everything doesn't have to be.
[286:27.09]Oh, it's going to be really high energy and tons of interaction.
[286:31.41]And maybe it's just fun to do one day.
[286:35.69]Just to hang out and play it.
[286:39.22]A lot of reading out loud.
[286:40.08]Well, I do sorcery.
[286:40.80]Sorcery is fun.
[286:42.28]Kind of the same thing, right?
[286:55.18]Yeah, I've said thousand year door.
[286:58.98]That's the one where Luigi goes.
[287:06.51]I'll give it a try.
[287:17.51]That was a great walk down there by player 244.
[287:27.18]I'll tell you what I'm the most excited for besides Elden Ring's DLC.
[287:31.42]WarioWare.
[287:35.06]Going back to the basics on WarioWare.
[287:39.32]I'm going to play the absolute hell out of that game.
[287:52.77]I'm going to try to 100% that game.
[287:58.40]I hope it's good.
[288:04.82]You can swear, you know, right?
[288:07.54]Yeah, but my mother was just here.
[288:08.74]You know, I'm kind of used to... Being a little more... A little more tame.
[288:19.75]Alright, everybody, if you're in the game right now, do... Oh, we're doing Icebreaker.
[288:22.97]I want to... What is that one?
[288:28.92]But you're almost 40.
[288:29.60]It doesn't matter how if you're 30, 40, 50.
[288:34.36]Nobody wants to be like, oh, fuck this.
[288:36.19]Fuck you and fuck that and fucking whatever.
[288:40.17]It's my mother.
[288:41.11]You're going to come on.
[288:59.40]My mom cusses a lot.
[289:01.48]Yeah, my mother swears too, a lot.
[289:04.16]My mother and father both swear.
[289:05.48]It was never, like, weird.
[289:09.58]But... I tone it down a... You tone it down a little bit.
[289:16.56]You don't wanna... You just don't wanna overdo it.
[289:21.08]In front of Ma and Dad.
[289:36.11]My mom is here.
[289:46.17]How come you're not playing this?
[289:49.54]I'm sure your mother would think this was fun.
[289:52.10]I'm sure your mother would love this game.
[289:53.90]Why?
[289:54.10]You guys should play it.
[290:04.95]Family-friendly streamer.
[290:09.51]Stay tuned.
[290:13.99]Coming up next, we got... Can't think of anything funny.
[290:20.30]Just imagine I was pretending to be a G-rated person.
[290:25.46]Okay.
[290:28.38]So how do we feel about that?
[290:40.44]I somehow got the W on that one and I don't know how.
[290:56.41]You watching the Disney camp?
[291:12.01]Oh, that's also a dinosaur.
[291:27.85]Oh.
[291:36.35]That shut the whole crowd up.
[291:53.75]I just slipped on the fucking banana peel.
[291:55.37]Alright, we're good.
[291:56.11]Sorry mom.
[292:09.86]They were Yoshi's before.
[292:11.64]Yeah, that's true.
[292:12.48]They can stay Yoshi's.
[292:21.28]My shovel.
[292:26.25]I did not hit my head on the shovel, right?
[292:29.29]We can all agree on that.
[292:34.14]Shit.
[292:47.57]Oh, that's not good.
[292:51.69]That's bad.
[292:52.19]Not good.
[293:04.82]I'm so greedy.
[293:05.62]I want it so bad.
[293:06.60]Now I'm dead.
[293:08.98]Now I think I'm dead.
[293:23.09]I'm so sorry.
[293:23.91]I forgot you were on my team.
[293:36.91]Get me away from the edge.
[293:38.19]Damn it.
[293:56.92]Oh, come on.
[293:57.56]Oh, that's so sad.
[294:00.28]That's very sad.
[294:06.18]I couldn't get him with the... I still have a teammate in here, right?
[294:15.89]Not anymore.
[294:24.95]Too slippery.
[294:35.16]Is this a bit?
[294:36.72]No, it's just the changing teams.
[294:41.21]One round, you're on green.
[294:42.35]One game, you're on blue.
[294:44.02]One, you're on red.
[294:45.92]Oh my god, that was a great shot.
[295:22.27]I had the exact same idea and we both missed.
[295:28.61]You leave him, but leave him alone.
[295:29.94]Leave him alone.
[295:30.42]This is my friend.
[295:46.13]That was dangerous move, but it was worth it.
[296:01.72]Head off.
[296:12.24]He just jumped over it.
[296:25.86]Let go of the shovel and get up!
[296:28.27]Bro, what are you doing?
[296:33.31]I couldn't drop the shovel.
[296:36.11]I couldn't drop the shovel.
[296:38.13]It was just still in my hands.
[296:40.88]Oh.
[296:46.96]I got you.
[296:47.28]I got you.
[296:47.56]I got you.
[296:48.72]You got it.
[296:49.74]I know you got this.
[296:50.56]Throwman.
[296:53.66]Throwman.
[296:54.08]Throwman.
[296:54.42]That's teamwork right there.
[297:02.60]Oh, you can do it.
[297:08.09]No!
[297:10.91]It was a good try.
[297:11.77]Nice try.
[297:19.34]Anybody's game?
[297:35.85]I have no defense on that.
[297:42.73]I don't have a defense on Witcher 7.
[297:43.85]Dude, you're going to kill yourself too.
[297:48.92]You're going to die down here too.
[297:50.78]It's not worth it.
[297:52.26]It's not worth it.
[297:52.72]Trust me.
[297:53.08]Just get up there.
[297:55.64]See?
[297:56.34]Forget about the bat.
[298:07.80]No, you OK don't.
[298:16.93]Get on this.
[298:17.35]I'm dead.
[298:25.03]I was just way too far away.
[298:26.13]I wouldn't have made it.
[298:36.00]My buddy still here now.
[298:49.17]He doesn't see it.
[299:02.32]You're a bad teammate.
[299:04.34]I accidentally hit him.
[299:05.50]I protected him at least two or three times.
[299:08.70]But it was the one time that I hit him in the head with the shovel.
[299:10.64]You guys are going to keep going back to.
[299:12.61]A lot of stuff just came out.
[299:26.55]Alright, deny yellow at all costs.
[299:30.05]Sounds like a plan.
[299:53.59]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!
[300:10.29]Alright, don't come.
[300:37.30]Shit.
[300:39.34]That's bad.
[300:40.24]Oh, thank God.
[300:46.87]I just can't catch a break.
[300:48.61]Get me up.
[300:56.49]No, what the fuck?
[301:02.01]How am I still here?
[301:05.98]Time for you to go for a fucking swim.
[301:26.89]Oh shit, shovel versus pan.
[301:34.82]Oh, shit!
[301:37.66]Oh, I thought I had an extra half second.
[301:39.77]No!
[301:40.27]He got me with the very, very end of it.
[301:45.71]It was like the tip of the top of it.
[301:53.65]He had the length.
[301:54.51]That was always going to be hard.
[301:58.29]He had a full foot on me and what he could be able to swing with.
[302:18.50]I made it in the picture.
[302:19.32]Alright, last one.
[302:24.23]Last one.
[302:26.81]And then I am going to go eat some dinner.
[302:29.83]And I am going to go chill.
[302:41.00]What's the other game I said I wanted to play?
[302:42.14]Oh, Resident Evil 4 DLC.
[302:43.04]Okay.
[302:52.25]We got to close it on the type when it's the best one.
[302:57.16]F099 and the DLC for Resident Evil 4.
[303:09.33]He's addicted to the funny animal game.
[303:10.99]Oh, it's it's great.
[303:19.59]Let me think of some good calendar Sunday.
[303:25.75]Sunday or Monday.
[303:37.32]I gotta go out big so.
[303:43.22]My best games were with the cat.
[303:56.21]When are you going to stream?
[303:57.95]Either Sunday or Monday this week.
[304:01.21]Likely Monday.
[304:02.07]Monday makes the most sense for me.
[304:03.86]Schedule wise.
[304:04.70]It's going to be annoying over here.
[304:36.29]No, you don't understand.
[304:37.32]It's the boat that's the problem.
[304:38.90]It's the boat that's the problem.
[304:47.44]We need to fight the boat.
[304:48.92]You guys don't get it.
[304:51.11]They want us to fucking kill each other.
[304:52.73]And then they'll get all the snacks.
[305:00.63]Oh god, watch out.
[305:09.51]I'm just climbing up.
[305:20.02]If there's ever a game that I wish the floss was in, it's this one.
[305:23.52]Because I would just do it right here.
[305:35.88]Welcome.
[305:48.85]I don't think a bird shit on me.
[306:00.30]I don't think any of us are going to get out of here.
[306:06.62]Yeah, there's no getting up.
[306:10.30]Okay, now there is.
[306:15.71]This is a victory for sure.
[306:34.70]Come on.
[306:35.95]Come on.
[306:36.57]I had more health than you did.
[306:40.13]I had more health than you, didn't I?
[306:41.43]Oh.
[306:49.53]I'm about cracked out right now.
[307:07.49]Hey, what's up, you piece of shit?
[307:10.65]Oh, that's my friend.
[307:11.33]I'm so fucking sorry.
[307:14.91]I'm so sorry.
[307:21.59]He's AFK, whatever.
[307:23.31]It doesn't matter.
[307:23.85]It's not like he was playing anyways.
[307:30.69]Oh boy.
[307:33.15]Might be in trouble.
[307:40.23]I don't think I have enough stamina to get up all the way.
[307:43.27]Oh, it's gonna be close, OK?
[308:02.17]You dummy.
[308:04.43]Oh no, my friend.
[308:24.34]Oh!
[308:29.90]Stay up!
[308:41.26]Back into the cockpit again.
[308:42.78]I'm just gonna spam the headbutt button and see what happens.
[308:56.78]He was just left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right to my face and killed me.
[309:04.59]Come on, man.
[309:16.00]Ugh.
[309:22.65]Yeah, that was full wind up in the face.
[309:26.81]Right hand, full elbow up back.
[309:29.29]Left hand in the face.
[309:30.91]Repeat 10 times.
[309:32.17]I was not going to get up from that.
[309:40.90]Going off the top rope.
[309:48.61]Oh, the rocket came out.
[310:00.34]I just got rocked.
[310:07.01]Come on, it's right there.
[310:08.49]Grab it.
[310:10.27]It's right here.
[310:19.60]Put somebody in the missile silo.
[310:21.30]I got somebody in the very beginning of the stream.
[310:22.90]Damn it.
[310:26.91]Well, let's see if I can blow somebody up.
[310:28.61]Is my teammate still here?
[310:30.69]Oh no, they're AFK.
[310:35.81]Good placement.
[310:39.55]Yes!
[310:44.31]Holy shit, that was diabolical, dude.
[310:47.75]You already had the win.
[310:49.03]You froze him and then just kicked his dead, lifeless body into the water.
[310:56.96]That was terrible.
[310:57.66]What are you looking at?
[311:01.92]Whoops.
[311:03.62]I'm gonna get him right in the head.
[311:05.98]I didn't even know.
[311:10.20]Fuck!
[311:10.88]How much higher?
[311:38.11]we want yellow to win but looks a little hairy right now oh maybe
[312:02.20]We need a crown too.
[312:15.95]Yeah!
[312:18.35]Let's get this party going!
[312:20.96]I'm underneath this and I can't get up.
[312:23.22]What the fuck?
[312:27.56]Am I underneath the boat?
[312:35.97]Oh, that rocket's coming out.
[312:58.12]Blast him.
[313:14.28]This is going to be so scary for this guy.
[313:28.48]Nice try.
[313:31.08]Fuck that.
[313:37.83]You thought you could get rid of me?
[313:39.99]Not yet.
[313:56.21]That's not fair.
[313:56.61]They shouldn't be able to throw things from the stands.
[314:01.77]You shouldn't be able to throw things from the stands.
[314:03.08]That's just not... That's very dangerous.
[314:17.97]I just hit about the ground.
[314:25.47]Oh alright.
[314:33.67]I went for the punch.
[314:38.46]Is there a reason why I was just electrocuted for 100 million years?
[314:57.20]Why me?
[314:57.90]Why me?
[314:58.50]Anybody else?
[315:01.05]Leave me alone.
[315:01.69]Somebody help me.
[315:09.63]Oh.
[315:10.73]Now the tables have turned.
[315:13.14]Looks like you're in a little bit of a pickle, aren't you?
[315:15.76]Be careful down there.
[315:18.58]Oh.
[315:18.64]You're alive, I see.
[315:35.08]Hello, Captain.
[315:43.06]I thought I was friendly.
[315:44.04]I was not.
[315:50.03]It always happens like this.
[315:51.49]And then someone's going to drop a brick on my head and they're going to throw me overboard.
[315:56.01]This gorilla... Yeah, see?
[315:57.49]What?
[316:01.90]What?
[316:03.81]Somebody stop him.
[316:05.18]Stop him.
[316:05.88]Gorilla, help me.
[316:07.22]It's 2v2 with one on each team.
[316:10.12]2v2.
[316:10.32]That's fine.
[316:15.20]I'll just climb to the top.
[316:23.01]Ow.
[316:24.47]Let go.
[316:33.00]I should have won that.
[316:37.87]This didn't have enough health.
[316:54.83]Watch out!
[317:09.42]Why am I not swinging it?
[317:20.11]Damn it.
[317:26.27]You want to put me in the fucking juice machine, huh?
[317:28.51]You want to put me in the juicer?
[317:29.63]I think you're going to put me in the fucking meat grinder, don't you?
[317:35.72]Well, now we're both dead.
[317:37.02]Hope you're happy.
[317:46.34]I gotta go.
[317:58.79]Oh my god.
[318:00.37]That was the strongest headbutt I have ever seen.
[318:04.19]That was... I just got sent to outer space.
[318:11.76]You can definitely get there.
[318:14.70]Are you kidding me?
[318:15.58]Sitting there.
[318:19.76]I'm holding Y and right trigger and this won't do it.
[318:38.06]I have to try.
[318:52.32]Too much lasagna.
[318:56.69]That was a crazy headbutt.
[319:04.79]Is it green?
[319:08.35]It wasn't blue.
[319:09.18]Alright, one more.
[319:11.48]I want to do one more.
[319:12.06]Actually, one more.
[319:13.08]I mean it.
[319:13.38]I just went out really badly.
[319:30.11]Rude.
[319:33.88]Rude.
[319:47.88]Still looks the coolest, though.
[319:51.60]There's some pretty cool cats here.
[319:57.56]This game seems rage-inducing.
[319:59.44]You would think so, but everything is so goofily presented that you can't be.
[320:15.17]Please play as Melon Dog.
[320:16.43]I don't think I can right now.
[320:31.04]Don't pull the brake this time.
[320:32.50]Yeah, I'll... I'll try.
[320:34.26]I'll be Melon Dog.
[320:51.12]Should I actually try winning this time?
[320:55.72]It's not about winning.
[320:58.09]It's about whoa.
[321:00.87]The moose.
[321:11.73]Let's go.
[321:17.56]What an insane animal mousses.
[321:22.76]Sometimes you forget just how unbelievably massive a moose really is.
[321:26.24]They're like elephants.
[321:28.53]They're gigantic.
[321:35.65]They're such a majestic... They're those antlers too.
[322:02.55]What was it the sign that I get hit in the face by the sign?
[322:05.65]Oh.
[322:06.85]Alright, I don't go fuck with the other team.
[322:25.72]It's just like looking into the abyss.
[322:27.62]I have I just I need to go over here.
[322:41.75]Alright, will they let me help them?
[322:43.25]Let's see.
[322:50.29]Stop.
[322:54.70]I'm on your team.
[322:57.10]Holy shit is a mess over here.
[323:05.60]I want to play too.
[323:11.06]Actually, you know, while that's happening, let's load this shit up.
[323:27.49]Forget about this.
[323:28.15]Alright, forget about the moose.
[323:29.49]Forget about the moose.
[323:30.56]Just put the coal in.
[323:31.72]He's doing it on purpose to mess with us.
[323:38.74]It's such a great strategy.
[323:41.10]It's just like, I have to get this moose.
[323:43.56]He's just, we have to kill him.
[323:45.40]And then you can just get distracted the whole time.
[323:51.24]Alright, somebody killed the moose.
[323:57.75]No, no, get me out of the fire.
[324:17.04]Whoa, easy.
[324:19.46]I think we can still do it.
[324:23.61]Okay, I've had just about enough of this.
[324:25.45]Get out of here!
[325:10.71]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[325:16.16]I think we're going to lose.
[325:17.06]It wasn't my fault, though.
[325:20.94]I just jumped off the edge like five times accidentally and then accidentally killed a teammate.
[325:34.95]Little bros running around here with a tennis racket right now.
[325:39.38]He has no regard for anything.
[325:40.66]He's just hitting every... It doesn't even matter who... He doesn't care what letters or colors or... He's just hitting everybody.
[325:46.49]It doesn't matter who it is.
[325:48.37]This gator needs to be stopped immediately.
[326:04.31]He still has it.
[326:06.94]Somebody stop him!
[326:08.62]Stop this fucking gator!
[326:14.07]You're watching too much TikTok?
[326:20.46]I don't have TikTok.
[326:25.89]Guys, I'm not even signed into YouTube.
[326:29.73]I watch YouTube shorts until I fuck up my entire algorithm to the point where it's just wacky, wacko shit.
[326:38.25]And then I have to clear all my search history and all my fucking browser history on it.
[326:43.40]So I reset the algorithm again.
[326:44.98]And then it gets all fucked up again in like 20 minutes.
[326:53.34]Yeah, and it's even worse when you reset the algorithm.
[326:56.00]It's even worse.
[326:58.20]For like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[327:03.71]And then you go through one of these YouTube shorts.
[327:06.05]It's just like, oh shit, this was like a fucking goofy one.
[327:08.93]And I could have just skipped it, but I was on it from the whole time.
[327:13.90]I watched the whole thing.
[327:15.24]So now I fucked up the algorithm again.
[327:21.66]One too many roll the glass down the stairs videos.
[327:25.28]And it's just like, oh, I want to see what happens.
[327:26.90]And it's like, oh, shit.
[327:29.24]Ah, damn it.
[327:32.02]Now I got to go clear the watch history again.
[327:36.75]And I watch him every time.
[327:38.23]I watch him the whole way through.
[327:45.53]I don't watch very much YouTube shorts, though.
[327:48.05]I feel like they literally burn a hole in your brain.
[327:52.87]I I seriously alright now that was supposed to be the last one oh wait I don't want to do a sports one they're fun wait is this football or soccer
[328:24.01]Yeah, no, I gotta go.
[328:25.09]I want to eat something.
[328:27.77]It's been a little while since I've had some food.
[328:30.93]Is it bad?
[328:31.35]Is it BM if I leave?
[328:37.23]No, it's all bots anyways.
[328:38.83]You get, um, if you leave.
[328:51.31]It's BM.
[328:51.91]You have to play.
[328:54.43]Okay, fine.
[328:56.79]Let's make this quick.
[329:15.84]Alright, we have the advantage here.
[329:24.20]let this otter take the ball from us, are we?
[329:52.26]what am I doing why would he oh my stamina bar is low and somehow I managed to get out with that they were just pulling me in two different directions that was so stupid
[330:29.43]Good.
[330:30.30]Alright, get it down, Phil.
[330:31.74]Down, down, down, down.
[330:34.06]No.
[330:34.42]Okay, good.
[330:46.01]It's alright.
[331:05.34]I'm gonna rip his head off.
[331:12.92]That's a lot of people all holding the ball.
[331:21.34]Let go of me.
[331:32.23]Get that shit out of here.
[331:38.01]Now this is interesting.
[331:42.95]I don't think the ball is technically on the ground or.
[331:47.79]I don't know where it is.
[332:01.20]Alright, if we actually score after that, that's going to be fucking awesome.
[332:07.63]Come on, we can do it.
[332:08.99]That's so clutch if we do.
[332:11.07]Get it, bunny.
[332:13.33]Oh, so clutch.
[332:14.61]Get it in there.
[332:17.49]You didn't think I was ready for that?
[332:19.87]You didn't think I was ready to catch that?
[332:21.44]Is that what you thought?
[332:22.48]Did you think that?
[332:23.90]Oh, no.
[332:24.54]Get it, bunny, right there.
[332:25.34]Come on, get it in there.
[332:30.90]That's a huge, that's a huge deal.
[332:38.75]That's one for the history books for sure.
[332:46.75]How come that didn't count before?
[332:49.42]I think because the ball was on top of so many people that it technically was out of bounds.
[332:53.20]That's my best guess.
[332:57.44]Oh, they're pissed off now.
[333:02.24]Alright.
[333:13.36]Yeah, they are not happy about that.
[333:15.22]Stay back here.
[333:25.59]Right through his head.
[333:31.21]We can't just let him run away with it like this.
[333:53.58]Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[333:59.76]Let's go.
[334:12.88]One more, two more.
[334:26.71]Uh, that's gonna be a goal.
[334:28.76]Alright.
[334:29.80]Well.
[334:30.04]It's a game now.
[334:48.21]And... That is big.
[334:53.39]So is this if I stop you.
[334:56.63]Big run it in.
[334:58.39]Yeah, nice.
[335:00.99]I like this one way more than the soccer one or the hockey one.
[335:21.60]Alright, we're all here.
[335:22.36]We're all here.
[335:22.74]Just let let somebody let somebody grab it.
[335:29.42]Everybody wants to be the hero of the game.
[335:31.00]I ran out of stamina.
[335:49.46]Somebody grab it.
[335:51.98]We could win it right here.
[335:55.78]There you go.
[335:57.14]Wow, the juke.
[335:58.31]That was unbelievable.
[336:03.21]He went a little too far over his head.
[336:05.55]Watch this.
[336:07.27]He knows he's coming.
[336:08.68]Wow.
[336:11.68]That was well played on both of them.
[336:15.16]That was a great play for both of them.
[336:16.81]It's just one of them did it a little better.
[336:35.00]Ah, no stamina.
[336:52.79]Good.
[336:53.73]Exactly what you should have done.
[336:56.47]Oh, yes.
[336:57.37]It's alright.
[336:58.47]Good, good, good, good.
[336:59.01]Grab it, grab it.
[337:06.25]Shit, they're gonna tie it up.
[337:08.19]No, they're not.
[337:15.81]OK.
[337:15.89]Great, what?
[337:16.65]42?
[337:16.67]43?
[337:30.44]They still have a chance.
[337:32.04]Oh, we should be alright.
[337:36.77]Do not let him run away with it like that.
[337:52.64]Together.
[337:53.02]Oh, that's it.
[338:02.49]Nice.
[338:04.79]I was about to score right here anyways.
[338:11.53]Alright, went out on a win.
[338:12.41]That's good.
[338:23.28]Alright, everybody.
[338:25.18]I will see you guys on probably Monday.
[338:29.08]But did I get any money?
[338:30.13]Because if I got money, then no.
[338:34.07]Monday, probably around like 4 or 5 Pacific.
[338:38.34]This game is really good.
[338:39.96]This is a great just kind of hang out and play game.
[338:41.53]It's a great kind of party game I would imagine.
[338:51.20]Yeah, see you guys soon.
[338:52.12]See you in four or five days.
[338:54.14]Monday is what four or five days from now.
[338:59.63]How's it going?
[339:00.01]That was fun.
[339:08.69]Going to have some pretty interesting things to talk about very soon.
[339:16.06]A couple of fun things.
[339:21.74]Grotto Beasts TTS is very, very close.
[339:25.92]Very close.
[339:29.21]I'd expect you'll see a lot more on that very, very soon.
[339:31.49]And that's just going to kind of live as long as people want to play it.
[339:38.55]And then there's something else fun.
[339:40.85]I'm going to be doing something.
[339:44.11]It'd be interesting.
[339:48.85]I got to figure out a lot of stuff here in the next like three months.
[339:57.16]We're going to do sorcery on Monday.
[339:59.14]I want to do the Resident Evil 4 DLC.
[340:02.56]So we'll do that that if that takes three or four hours, baby.
[340:05.70]But that's the plan for Monday.
[340:17.27]Hope you start making YouTube shorts.
[340:21.11]I want to do a YouTube short where I just have a podcast microphone in front of me.
[340:27.02]It's like a podcast room and I'm just talking to somebody who also has like a podcast mic in front of them.
[340:32.81]As if this is like episode 400.
[340:48.77]Just upload a shitload of them.
[341:00.64]I've seen people do that.
[341:01.56]That's funny.
[341:05.28]I don't have any.
[341:06.18]I really don't have any plans for YouTube shorts.
[341:08.14]Maybe.
[341:08.60]I remember talking to Ster about how interesting the concept was.
[341:16.21]And he's talked about it a lot too.
[341:21.55]But a YouTube short for me, I would want it to be... There's two kind of schools of thought.
[341:29.48]It's like highlight interesting things that happen on a stream, but also, or that's something that's happened in a video, but also a completely just original 30 second short video.
[341:44.82]But then I feel like you go kind of down the rabbit hole with that.
[341:47.38]And I don't know exactly how much time I want to put into something like YouTube Shorts.
[341:53.33]Not really much time at all, if I'm honest.
[341:56.11]Let me turn this off.
[342:09.45]Yeah, thanks for hanging out.
[342:10.29]Thanks for watching.
[342:10.90]I didn't have, I think a couple of raids came in.
[342:15.42]Looks like I missed them.
[342:18.19]I'm getting a more comfortable setup, though.
[342:19.91]This is step one of three stages to be able to kind of not be sitting so upright when I stream.
[342:30.97]And I feel pretty good.
[342:31.81]I feel okay.
[342:33.11]Usually after about six hours, I kind of start to lock up a little and feel like, but I felt pretty good today, so.
[342:44.49]Are you laying down?
[342:45.29]Well, I'm not.
[342:46.09]That was a joke.
[342:47.61]I'm sitting up.
[342:49.23]But I'm just sitting back into a more comfortable kind of pillowy chair.
[342:54.84]And it is on the ground.
[342:56.68]And I have stuff underneath me too on the ground.
[343:01.39]It's comfortable.
[343:01.95]I like it.
[343:12.03]Yeah, I'll see you guys on Monday.
[343:13.08]Probably around like, let's just say five Pacific.
[343:17.46]That makes sense.
[343:19.94]Do another kind of later night stream.
[343:25.16]I'll have facecam on next time because I mean, it's a horror game.
[343:38.45]Alright, see you guys soon.
[343:39.55]Take care.
[343:41.09]Call your mother.
[343:42.29]You know, you know the drill.
[343:44.69]Call your father too, why not?
[343:46.43]Call them both.
[343:49.05]Call your siblings.
[343:50.59]Call your friends.
[343:50.99]Alright, take care.
[344:36.84]you
