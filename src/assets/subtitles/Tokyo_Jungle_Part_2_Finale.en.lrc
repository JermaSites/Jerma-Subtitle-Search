[00:45.88]Except for, like, there was, like, one time, like, last week, where it was, like, 7.45.
[00:50.71]And then once, like, a few days later, it was, like, at 8.
[00:54.57]And, like, four or five days ago, it was, like, 7.15.
[00:58.07]We've been on time every stream, okay?
[01:04.65]By the way, I'm going to wait for people to trickle in because we got stuff to talk about real quick.
[01:12.02]Why am I turning into such an old fuckface?
[01:14.30]We got stuff to talk about.
[01:17.10]Talk about stuff with you guys.
[01:22.84]I don't like how the world is.
[01:25.93]What am I, fucking 70?
[01:28.87]I'm drinking this coffee.
[01:31.17]I'm drinking a coffee out of the cup.
[01:34.06]Like, you know the top plastic cup with the straw butthole in the middle?
[01:38.20]You, like, stick it in the straw asshole and you, like, drink out of it?
[01:42.15]I took the top off and I'm drinking it like a fucking savage.
[01:45.41]Like, I'm drinking it like a fucking mutant right now.

[01:48.21]Alright, so.
[01:53.71]The what?
[01:56.09]What are you talking about?
[01:56.78]The what?
[01:58.58]Next time you get a soda or a coffee, take a look at the top.
[02:01.92]Take a look at it.
[02:03.54]It's a puckered asshole.
[02:05.80]This is not me being gross, that's just real.
[02:08.38]That's what your asshole looks like.
[02:09.88]It is.
[02:13.36]You take a picture of the top of a cup without a straw in it.
[02:16.10]Or maybe, like, punch the straw in a little so it gets, you know, what it looks like.
[02:20.40]You punch the straw and then you put a picture of an asshole and a picture of, like, the straw anus next to each other.
[02:27.11]Dye the anus straw thing, like, you know, whatever, like, so it, like, matches, like, whatever, like, skin tone you have.
[02:33.51]Not gonna tell a difference.
[02:38.11]Alright, so.
[02:39.49]Here's what we're gonna do.
[02:41.60]No, um...
[02:42.88]No, we are not playing... We are absolutely not going to play Tokyo Jungle.
[02:49.73]It's not... I couldn't do it.
[02:52.87]It wouldn't work.
[02:54.45]Everyone that's saying alligator, alligator, alligator, I'm sorry.
[03:00.15]But that's just the way it is.
[03:01.89]We're playing Bear Grylls Presents Man vs. Wild.
[03:05.03]It was voted for.
[03:07.45]Everybody voted for it.
[03:09.19]It was either that or Continue Stalker.
[03:13.03]And we're going to play Bear Grylls Man vs. Wild.
[03:15.14]So, I'll be back in two seconds.
[03:18.18]We're going to get the stream set up.
[03:38.81]Oh, I got cut off.
[03:39.79]That's right.
[03:40.17]Sorry.
[03:41.47]Sorry, I forgot I'm on like the uh... Sorry, I forgot.
[03:45.69]It's okay.
[03:46.03]We're good.
[03:47.57]I know there's no sound.
[03:48.83]I know.
[03:51.49]I'm still gonna play Stalker, yes.
[03:54.25]So let's go.
[03:54.91]Let's get started.
[03:57.01]I think a lot of people have trickled in here now.
[03:58.55]We can just start playing with the alligator!
[04:02.91]That's right, ladies and gentlemen!
[04:06.59]You thought it was a fucking joke!
[04:09.70]PlayStation Network!
[04:18.47]You guys didn't think I was gonna deliver.
[04:21.98]You guys didn't think I was gonna fucking deliver the alligator.
[04:24.38]Here we go.
[04:25.28]Here it is.
[04:35.37]Best $1 joke so far.
[04:37.89]By the way, we're only doing this until I die.
[04:39.64]Does the alligator have, like, special moves?
[04:43.88]What's going on here?
[04:45.28]What?
[04:45.64]What?
[04:45.84]Like, the game's moving on its own.
[04:48.22]What's going on?
[04:49.60]What's happening right now?
[04:52.13]Uh, I'm not even kidding.
[04:52.97]Like, I bought the fucking alligator and now they... I'm not doing this!
[04:56.87]Look at this!
[04:57.85]Where's my fucking webcam?
[05:01.36]I have to... I gotta unplug the controller.
[05:06.75]I think my controller's broken, I'm not even kidding.
[05:10.03]What the fuck is going on here?
[05:16.52]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[05:17.98]This is important.
[05:21.58]I think the alligator broke my fucking controller.
[05:32.38]What the fuck is going on?
[05:33.82]Is my controller broken?
[05:35.64]Here we go.
[05:37.22]Nope.
[05:39.00]Alright, we're good.
[05:42.50]Something is very painfully wrong with this controller, though.
[05:46.32]It's going to cause a lot of problems.
[05:48.32]Did I miss the flag up here?
[05:49.54]No.
[05:50.10]Now I gotta go back up.
[05:56.55]Yeah, I know, I'm starving to death because I couldn't eat anything.
[06:02.66]I have to eat this quick, because if I could... I'm... I'm... I can fucking control it, man.
[06:28.81]I don't know what the hell was going on there.
[06:30.01]It was like... It was forcing me to jump and shit.
[06:34.26]Alright, well let's play Bear Grylls.
[06:36.08]This is your alligator.
[06:38.34]Look, before we end the stream, I will do another alligator run.
[06:40.88]I promise.
[06:42.98]I got the high scores.
[06:45.66]Alright, so give me a second.
[06:46.50]Let me actually put the correct game in here.
[06:54.38]Why am I being silent?
[06:56.78]I thought I muted the mic and I'm just sitting here like... Being quiet.
[07:01.85]Why am I being so quiet?
[07:07.86]I thought the mic received it.
[07:14.77]Whoops.
[07:15.49]$1 joke incoming.
[07:16.21]Actually, I have like $4 on the account now.
[07:19.27]So I technically could buy the other animals.
[07:24.43]Okay, let's switch back now.
[07:33.00]I've got a gray screen.
[07:34.06]That's interesting.
[07:35.04]Never seen that before.
[07:37.55]By the human?
[07:38.50]Where is the human?
[07:39.46]Is that like a weird DLC?
[07:42.66]We'll take a look.
[07:43.54]Let's see.
[07:46.38]Alright, we're good.
[07:46.88]Let's go out of here.
[07:49.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:50.59]Warning.
[07:50.97]Be careful if you have a problem.
[07:53.83]That could be a problem.
[07:54.87]Okay.
[08:01.04]How much did the Jurassic Park game cost?
[08:04.44]Um...
[08:06.56]I don't remember.
[08:07.22]Let's see.
[08:08.78]The price is behind here.
[08:09.73]I don't think this one was that expensive.
[08:13.09]Let me take a look.
[08:18.49]This one, they covered up the price.
[08:20.63]Sneaky.
[08:24.40]Where is it?
[08:25.02]I can't even see it.
[08:28.66]No, the price isn't on here, I don't think.
[08:32.02]This one definitely wasn't 20 bucks.
[08:36.66]I'm certain of that one.
[08:39.56]No, there's no price on it.
[08:42.82]I think this one was like eight bucks.
[08:49.84]Still not worth it.
[08:53.72]Okay, let's go check it.
[08:55.02]Look, a new story, a new archive.
[08:56.68]Yes, yes, yes.
[08:58.62]New game, single player.
[09:00.56]So where's this office worker?
[09:04.88]What are you... Like, complete story mode to unlock this animal?
[09:09.55]Are we sure that I... Is it a purchasable thing?
[09:12.09]Or is there an actual... I don't think I can do it.
[09:17.53]Where is this office worker you guys are talking about?
[09:23.37]All I see is, like, two Pomeranians, a giraffe, and the... It's DLC.
[09:30.09]Um...
[09:32.88]He's hidden on the screen.
[09:33.68]You have to go to the game's PSN page.
[09:38.64]Well, let's do this first.
[09:43.49]Let's do this first.
[09:45.67]He's above the kangaroo.
[09:50.43]Well, whatever.
[09:56.49]We're gonna do a real crocodile.
[10:00.35]Real crocodile stream.
[10:02.63]Thank you, Muse for the bits.
[10:03.89]Eating dog food and eating mayo is connected, I bet.
[10:06.35]Mayonnaise is delicious.
[10:07.25]Come on.
[10:07.61]Don't be one of those people.
[10:10.53]Mayonnaise is fucking delicious.
[10:14.01]You don't eat mayonnaise like out of the jar.
[10:15.59]Like, really?
[10:17.21]Are we going to have one of those situations where people don't like mayonnaise?
[10:25.86]Gross.
[10:26.32]No, it adds so much flavor.
[10:28.00]You ever have a turkey sandwich after Thanksgiving?
[10:31.37]If you want to talk shit about mayonnaise, then please do this.
[10:33.53]I implore you.
[10:34.43]I implore you.
[10:34.95]Listen to me.
[10:37.57]After Thanksgiving, here's what I want you to do.
[10:41.57]And I can wear a stupid hat as an alligator.
[10:43.53]Hold on.
[10:48.30]He's like a little train conductor.
[10:51.72]All aboard, toot toot.
[10:54.82]Okay.
[10:56.54]Do I like deviled eggs?
[10:57.30]Love them.
[10:58.02]Delicious.
[11:02.33]Okay, after Thanksgiving, you're gonna make a sandwich.
[11:04.94]That's what you're gonna do.
[11:05.66]You're gonna make a fucking sandwich.
[11:08.42]The way that you would typically make a turkey sandwich, except this time.
[11:14.00]Why is it not dead?
[11:18.27]It's kind of awkward attacking as the alligator.
[11:20.95]You get really hungry as the alligator, too.
[11:31.15]I'm like starving at all times with the gator.
[11:36.73]Anyways, make a sandwich, put a bunch of mayonnaise on it.
[11:38.87]You implore me?
[11:43.23]I imply you.
[11:43.97]Why am I getting so many treats?
[11:50.56]You put a little, you put a couple slabs of turkey breast.
[11:54.04]And then you're gonna put like a little bit of cranberry sauce, some stuffing, a little bit of mashed potatoes.
[11:59.11]And then slab on the mayonnaise, toast the bread.
[12:02.61]And I dare you to tell me that that does not taste good.
[12:05.38]That's my favorite fucking sandwich.
[12:06.74]Except the gator kind of sucks.
[12:15.08]He's always hungry.
[12:20.64]High defense, though.
[12:22.64]Cranberry sauce is gross, I agree.
[12:24.48]But you gotta eat it right.
[12:26.84]When it's on a sandwich, it's great.
[12:28.70]You'll love it.
[12:29.22]Nobody's rad.
[12:33.53]Yeah, we'll probably get fairly far with this.
[12:43.14]Turkey Gobbler is, like, the name of the sandwich, and it's, like, by far one of my favorite things in the world.
[12:46.56]If you don't... Look, we can disagree.
[12:51.56]But that doesn't mean... Well, what's that thing?
[12:53.53]I don't agree with what you say, but I defend to death your right to say it.
[12:57.07]You know what I mean?
[13:01.03]Okay, I got the nest.
[13:04.15]Who said that?
[13:05.31]Some guy that made America?
[13:07.21]Somebody that made America?
[13:08.09]Ooh.
[13:10.37]Need to rank up.
[13:15.38]I'm sure if you gobble, it's more important than everything else.
[13:27.15]No, Spider-Man said that.
[13:30.09]Yeah, remember when Peter Parker said that famous American Revolution quote?
[13:42.21]God, I need a mate.
[13:43.99]A chick hero has come to Yoyigi Park.
[13:50.95]Woody's now easily perishable in the blood.
[13:52.55]Okay, you ready?
[13:54.39]She doesn't like me.
[13:55.45]God damn it.
[13:57.49]Toxicity is increasing.
[13:58.61]Fuck, come on, let's go.
[14:04.39]Why do I feel like my character right now is somebody's furry avatar?
[14:08.44]You know what I mean?
[14:10.98]I feel like this is some role player's furry avatar.
[14:18.58]I got it.
[14:24.14]Eat the pigeon.
[14:26.66]I'm going to have to get a desperate woman.
[14:27.71]A furry croc.
[14:32.53]Yeah.
[14:33.35]Come on.
[14:35.39]Don't you guys know anything about the fandom?
[14:38.78]It doesn't have to be furry.
[14:41.22]It could be a goddamn reptile.
[14:42.40]It could be a crocodile.
[14:46.20]Desperate?
[14:47.36]I can't do it.
[14:48.48]That's great.
[14:50.03]Nobody likes me.
[15:00.43]No, I'm not a furry.
[15:02.85]But I know that I understand the fandom.
[15:06.01]I know they're fans of that.
[15:07.33]I have to sleep here.
[15:10.83]Sleeping alone.
[15:11.45]$2,000 crocodile fursuit.
[15:25.50]There's no food.
[15:26.16]Well, when you sleep, there's extra food.
[15:28.83]I gotta get away from Rookie, though.
[15:30.27]I think that's the only way I'm gonna get anybody to like me.
[15:36.39]Can you hide as a crocodile?
[15:38.79]Not really.
[15:39.17]You're too huge.
[15:41.87]And a couple of rabbits.
[15:46.80]Almost there.
[15:48.66]Just a few more cows.
[15:49.68]Do you eat?
[15:50.02]I think you eat things in one bite as a crocodile.
[15:55.07]It's actually really useful.
[15:59.89]Use a lot of stamina, though.
[16:04.93]Well, this girl's desperate now, so, okay.
[16:09.33]The desperate female is following me.
[16:11.25]We gotta make some babies, unfortunately.
[16:12.75]We have to.
[16:17.75]Look, we're gonna put like a full costume on this guy.
[16:22.37]How do alligators have sex?
[16:25.61]Anybody have any idea?
[16:27.07]I've never seen it.
[16:27.85]There's no documentaries.
[16:29.71]How do two alligators have sex?
[16:33.07]If I mount the back of this person, it's gonna be fucking hilarious.
[16:39.40]That's not how... This is not how alligators have sex.
[16:41.94]They don't mount from behind.
[16:43.16]They don't, like, do it like doggy style.
[16:55.68]Do they?
[16:56.10]I don't think they do.
[17:03.38]Maybe I'm wrong.
[17:04.16]I really don't think so.
[17:08.70]Do they, like, roll on their backs and, like, slide into each other?
[17:11.06]Like, just, like, move, like, float into each other?
[17:16.37]They do?
[17:17.35]What?
[17:21.99]Yeah, don't, like, they just, like, kind of... Isn't it, like, not sexual?
[17:26.45]Doesn't the alligator just, like, roll over the eggs and, like, all of a sudden, like, alligators come out?
[17:36.96]Yeah, they're, like, the male alligator, like, smears his face all over the eggs.
[17:43.80]And then baby alligators come out, like, in 14 months.
[17:48.32]I don't know.
[17:48.82]Nobody knows.
[17:50.01]None of you know.
[17:50.93]I don't know.
[18:14.19]Oh, come on.
[18:15.87]Well, we're just having fun here.
[18:17.03]We're just having a little bit of fun.
[18:19.35]Damn it.
[18:21.41]Fucking rabbit's gonna get away.
[18:22.43]Uh... The crocodile's way too slow.
[18:34.46]Got it.
[18:34.82]Okay.
[18:34.94]I'm not gonna starve now.
[18:38.17]Why is the game called Tokyo Jungle?
[18:40.57]Because it takes place in the jungle.
[18:43.70]In Tokyo.
[18:44.32]Tokyo, this is like in the future and all animals like took over the world because all the humans died out and they turned it into their own little thing.
[18:50.68]Grass grows out of the concrete and you just don't question it.
[18:52.82]I don't think crocodiles even have penises.
[19:05.49]They don't, right?
[19:06.75]Like the crocodile doesn't have like a ball sack.
[19:10.57]Alright, I'm moving.
[19:11.93]We're done.
[19:12.53]We're done.
[19:12.99]We're done.
[19:13.39]I promise that was it.
[19:14.17]That was just the last point I wanted to make.
[19:15.85]Alright, I'm done.
[19:25.32]Promise.
[19:31.88]I'm sorry.
[19:33.56]We don't do like sexual humor on my stream, but now apparently we do.
[19:37.39]This is a PG-13 stream and that's rated R. How we doing?
[19:44.51]Nest over here?
[19:56.30]Another desperate female.
[19:57.86]All the crocodiles are desperate.
[20:06.13]Just doing like the... Doing the salmon.
[20:10.01]Get to the nest.
[20:10.61]Do the salmon impression.
[20:11.71]Come on.
[20:12.09]There you go.
[20:12.71]Now let's mate.
[20:14.65]Here we go.
[20:16.99]Mount her.
[20:18.23]Like all alligators do.
[20:23.85]New generation.
[20:24.57]Happy birthday.
[20:33.40]Why do they jump too?
[20:34.04]I don't know.
[20:37.15]Who has any idea at this point?
[20:38.59]Oh, okay.
[20:39.03]What do we got for challenges?
[20:40.07]Let's take a look.
[20:41.65]Get four clean kills.
[20:42.67]Got it.
[20:42.95]What about, like, these all the way down here?
[20:47.19]Find sunken car.
[20:51.59]Nothing really.
[20:52.81]Not yet, at least.
[20:53.79]Claim the jackal territory that's not active.
[20:56.66]Head to the shop district.
[21:02.36]Where's the shop district?
[21:05.56]That's all the way back there.
[21:06.54]It's too late.
[21:07.16]We're going to go to Yoyogi Park.
[21:09.88]We're already way too far away.
[21:13.28]Maybe.
[21:13.79]No, we're not.
[21:16.57]Let's go up.
[21:17.25]We have to at this point.
[21:18.15]We're already too far away.
[21:22.95]Go buy a sweet jacket.
[21:29.87]It's the right.
[21:35.60]actually though this could be very bad considering I don't have any but I have one thing like beef jerky and this place sucks can't go up there why crocodile you want me to go play drink no by the way what the fuck is up with that what is going on there
[22:05.17]Brink went free to play.
[22:10.50]Didn't that game come out like six years ago?
[22:12.50]Hasn't it been like four years?
[22:16.18]What, people are gonna go back to play Brink?
[22:18.18]Yeah, I guess it's been like five years since the game came out.
[22:22.80]Just make it free to play and like relaunch it.
[22:28.82]Nobody played it back when it was for money.
[22:32.30]Who's gonna, what, people gonna play it now?
[22:37.77]I heard that Brink was like a mess, too.
[22:40.05]Was it any good?
[22:40.65]I heard it was like a mess.
[22:43.46]Was it a mess?
[22:44.40]I never played it.
[22:48.18]It came out six years ago, but it's been four years, five since the game came out.
[22:52.08]Wait, what?
[22:53.42]I'm starving, by the way.
[22:54.30]Fuck.
[22:56.00]I gotta eat the beef jerky here.
[23:02.89]I wish I could move a little faster as the alligator.
[23:04.63]This is as fast as I can go.
[23:11.43]Host my own Brink server?
[23:15.46]No, I'm not gonna play Brink.
[23:19.64]I would play Brink for, like, five minutes and be like, eh, I don't know.
[23:32.02]What I'm looking forward to, like, shooter... Here are my top looking forward to video games, alright?
[23:36.32]You'll see these on stream.
[23:38.37]Number one, Cuphead.
[23:41.06]I'm going to beat that whole game on stream.
[23:42.85]Like, Cuphead is literally... I've been looking forward to that game for fucking... since they announced it.
[23:48.87]Cuphead.
[23:49.57]Number one.
[23:50.97]Number two.
[23:53.05]Uh, hold on.
[23:53.87]I'm gonna kill this Jack.
[23:56.35]This guy... Really?
[23:57.58]I tried.
[23:59.76]Didn't get a clean kill.
[24:01.24]He's still alive.
[24:04.66]You're telling me I can't even eat him?
[24:06.44]Give me a break.
[24:08.44]Eat him.
[24:10.10]Eat him!
[24:11.84]Eat him!
[24:13.92]It's not gonna work.
[24:14.44]He's in like a weird fucked up spot.
[24:15.78]God damn it.
[24:17.98]So Cuphead, Shadow of War, Lord of the Rings game, Shadow of War.
[24:22.00]That was one of my games.
[24:22.64]That was like my game of the year when it came out like three years ago.
[24:25.26]Fucking die.
[24:31.52]Heal stamina.
[24:32.22]That's not gonna do anything for me.
[24:34.77]We're gonna lose the guy with the hat.
[24:36.33]Sorry guys.
[24:45.24]And goodbye, train conductor crocodile.
[24:47.96]Your brother now takes your place.
[24:49.20]And it's claimed.
[24:57.77]How far away is this person?
[24:59.27]Right there.
[24:59.79]And the nest is over there.
[25:00.64]We gotta do this now.
[25:07.44]So, Shadow of War, Cuphead, and... Please, just be desperate.
[25:13.72]God damn it!
[25:16.79]Fuck!
[25:18.11]Oh, this is bad.
[25:18.85]This is really bad.
[25:20.53]I can't mate here.
[25:21.23]I have to go eat.
[25:22.49]I gotta get out of here.
[25:24.93]It's not gonna be long enough.
[25:25.61]I gotta go.
[25:26.15]Like, right now.
[25:33.80]Come on!
[25:34.42]Go!
[25:36.89]Drink.
[25:40.19]Go.
[25:44.01]Uh, I never told you the third game.
[25:45.36]Alright, well, hold on.
[25:48.26]Third game that's coming out is... Wait.
[26:00.15]Okay.
[26:00.31]I think we're good.
[26:02.59]How much food is here?
[26:03.27]There's, like, no fucking food here.
[26:05.41]What the...
[26:06.80]Why is there nothing here?
[26:09.24]How can there be no food here?
[26:10.42]It's Brink.
[26:12.30]All right.
[26:13.12]Brink is the third game.
[26:13.94]There you go.
[26:15.46]Before I die of hunger because there's no food anywhere.
[26:19.12]Shit.
[26:19.44]This is bad.
[26:20.12]It's over.
[26:20.54]Come on.
[26:23.89]Just give me one blip.
[26:24.71]Give me something.
[26:25.75]Give me something here.
[26:26.71]There's nothing here.
[26:34.53]Where did you even come from?
[26:37.49]Really?
[26:40.99]It's a Lycan?
[26:44.43]Eat him.
[26:45.13]I have to eat you.
[26:45.73]I don't care about getting attacked.
[26:47.17]Eat him.
[26:49.44]Damn it.
[26:52.58]Why are these guys not even on the minimap?
[27:01.32]Is my game broken?
[27:02.80]I don't see these guys on the map at all.
[27:06.02]Alright, what is it?
[27:06.50]What is it?
[27:07.48]A mask.
[27:09.08]What does this do for me?
[27:12.60]Sun visor, a mask.
[27:13.64]There's only... Okay, that's fucking stupid.
[27:23.98]It's just like a goofy, googly eyes mask for the crocodile.
[27:29.35]And nobody's preparing on my mini-map anymore.
[27:31.13]No animals are.
[27:31.75]I think something's bugged out here.
[27:40.81]Alright, there's that.
[27:41.65]The other flag over here I'm gonna have to get.
[27:43.69]Just get it now.
[27:50.15]But anyways, Cuphead, Shadow of War, and probably, like, Absolver.
[27:57.68]That looks like a lot of fun.
[27:59.08]I just hope it's fun.
[28:03.79]It could be bad.
[28:04.51]I think people could play, like, last week or something, or a few days ago.
[28:14.19]There's also that weird Dark Souls game that's coming out.
[28:16.75]I don't even know.
[28:17.81]It's like Mannequin Dark Souls.
[28:18.93]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[28:22.18]What's the Mannequin Dark Souls?
[28:26.30]It could be fun.
[28:34.65]There's also that new Monster Hunter that's coming out.
[28:36.47]There's that new other Monster Hunter that is not Capcom.
[28:43.02]It's like the old Riot guys that are making... what's it called?
[28:45.46]Like data... data miners?
[28:48.16]Dart... Dartmouth?
[28:49.46]What's it called?
[28:49.82]You know what I'm talking about.
[28:53.85]Ashen is that one.
[28:54.77]What's the other one I'm talking about?
[28:57.61]Down... Down to Earth?
[29:00.49]Dauntless.
[29:00.97]There it is.
[29:04.01]Dartmouth.
[29:04.45]Remember when I had an 8-hour Monster Hunter stream?
[29:11.61]Monster Hunter was cool!
[29:14.56]I was very... I liked... Here's the problem with Monster Hunter, though.
[29:21.14]Wasn't that the old one?
[29:22.34]The one for the Wii U?
[29:23.28]That's the one that's not the newest one.
[29:25.57]There was another one for the DS that came out that was newer and, like, better, right?
[29:29.59]So I might as well just wait for the good one to come out.
[29:31.65]Another hat.
[29:35.49]Might as well wait for the Monster Hunter world that's gonna come out on the Switch and be, like, better.
[29:39.21]I don't know.
[29:44.31]That one's much cooler.
[29:47.03]I get to be like Shredder.
[29:56.32]Four doesn't have like the shitty swimming.
[29:57.80]It's going to be on PC.
[30:00.98]All right.
[30:01.36]Well, then, yeah, there's a lot of cool shit that's going to.
[30:03.64]All right.
[30:04.92]Well, that's a fellow crocodile that was looking at me weird.
[30:07.48]You saw that.
[30:12.41]Uh, let me put more.
[30:13.35]Here's a gazelle.
[30:14.51]I can't fit in there, I'm too big.
[30:23.27]Murderer!
[30:24.23]Come on, now.
[30:25.97]Alright, let's get, let's make a new generation.
[30:29.92]That was fair.
[30:32.36]Average?
[30:33.26]Good.
[30:34.42]Back to the nest.
[30:35.80]All the way back here, unfortunately.
[30:44.50]But there's some time before, like, a lot of people were asking me why I'm playing, like, a lot of older games.
[30:50.83]How come you're playing these games that came out, like, in 2007, 2008?
[30:53.03]Well, I mean, there's a lot of great games that came out for, like, older systems and even on Steam.
[31:01.39]Like, Twitch and YouTube and stuff didn't, like, exist really back in, like, 2010 or, like, 2011.
[31:07.68]It kind of, like, started really getting off its feet in, like, 2011.
[31:12.56]Yeah.
[31:14.65]So, finding and playing games that came out before, like, Twitch was, like, even a thing?
[31:19.78]Of course I want to go back and, like, play some- I've wanted to play these games for years, and I've just never really had an opportunity to.
[31:24.06]Yes, it- What do you mean, yes, it did?
[31:31.74]YouTube wasn't, like, a- I'm talking about, like, gaming.
[31:34.50]Like, YouTube gaming?
[31:37.23]Who was the first channel you subscribed to?
[31:38.85]Guarantee you it was back in, like, 2010.
[31:40.01]Or, like, 2009.
[31:40.19]Oh.
[31:45.08]A lot of these games that came out in 2006, people weren't playing them.
[31:59.57]YouTube came out in 2004, but you used to get your videos claimed.
[32:04.73]A lot of you guys might not even remember this.
[32:09.62]But back in like old YouTube, like back in like 2008, if you uploaded like footage of GTA 4, your account got fucking terminated.
[32:18.98]You know what I mean?
[32:19.70]We're talking about the before times.
[32:26.07]Maybe some of you guys don't remember the before times.
[32:31.80]Do you know what I mean?
[32:32.48]Like, that shit used to be a real thing.
[32:36.22]Nobody, like, made gaming, like, videos for real back in, like, 2007, 2008.
[32:38.76]I'm gonna, like, die.
[32:56.75]There used to be like people put like fucking porn on YouTube porn was on YouTube like a lot of it back in like 2005 It was like all vlogs porn and And like and like that's back when like the vlogs were a thing.
[33:14.74]Do you guys remember lonely girl?
[33:17.93]Remember that fake channel?
[33:19.17]That, like, LonelyGirl16 or something?
[33:20.93]And it was, like, a big elaborate prank, and they made, like, this fake thing where she got, like... It was, like, a big deal.
[33:26.91]That was a long fucking time ago.
[33:28.85]I'm gonna lose a crock.
[33:32.09]Alright, well, this one's dead.
[33:38.23]Yeah, back when, like, LonelyGirl15 was around, there was no gaming videos.
[33:46.34]Medicine.
[33:48.06]Restores life and reduces toxicity.
[33:50.30]I'm in deep shit here.
[33:51.66]I don't even know why I'm claiming this.
[33:53.28]I gotta try to go all the way around to the left.
[33:59.73]I might be able to take this into the next zone with this guy.
[34:03.17]No, I'm gonna let this guy die.
[34:11.44]Like, you guys don't remember that the reason why people joined networks...
[34:15.77]Back in the day, for instance, Machinima, Maker, those channels existed, those places existed because you didn't want to get your channel claimed or shut down for copyright infringement.
[34:28.53]That was why you joined a network.
[34:31.33]Not only was it to enable ads and have ads, but it was because if you didn't do that, it was like, oh, I've got to be part of Machinima so my channel doesn't get terminated.
[34:53.93]Come on, make it.
[34:56.65]Can I sleep there?
[34:57.33]No, I gotta mate again.
[35:02.99]Yeah, there used to be a 10 minute video length on YouTube.
[35:09.02]There just was.
[35:09.66]It was a 10 minute limit.
[35:12.68]You had to do a bunch of shit.
[35:13.82]You had to have a certain amount of things on your channel before you were allowed to upload videos longer than 15 minutes.
[35:21.23]I remember that.
[35:28.18]Eat food?
[35:28.66]There's no food here.
[35:29.44]I have to just mate before I die.
[35:31.80]And pick up a present.
[35:37.72]I guess I could eat the medicine.
[35:39.16]But, let's see.
[35:39.73]Let's see how fast this goes.
[35:41.39]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[35:42.75]Really?
[35:43.71]Oh, god damn it.
[35:55.96]Come on, please be desperate, otherwise this is a dead run.
[36:05.86]Please be desperate, otherwise this is a dead run.
[36:08.20]I got one brother to do it, I got one sister to do it.
[36:13.93]Mmm, okay.
[36:14.59]If you're not desperate, this is a dead run.
[36:21.05]It's pristine, that's fucking fantastic.
[36:22.89]Okay, that's great, I have to sleep here then.
[36:31.37]No, I know I have that shit, but I don't want to use it.
[36:34.72]That's a bad time to use it.
[36:35.72]Because I know I have this one last guy to work with.
[36:38.26]And this food right here.
[36:40.88]Didn't get you, apparently.
[36:41.76]Somehow.
[36:42.08]Okay.
[36:51.17]Damn it.
[36:51.47]I have to take this medicine now.
[36:59.37]That's it.
[36:59.81]It reduces by like 10%.
[37:00.63]Alright, get in the fucking train and sleep.
[37:03.67]I can't even go in here.
[37:04.39]I'm too big.
[37:06.65]Oh, come on.
[37:07.91]Really?
[37:09.49]That's so annoying.
[37:11.25]That sucks.
[37:16.89]Am I gonna play PUBG again?
[37:18.17]Nah, probably not on stream.
[37:21.57]I have to eat this.
[37:22.35]I need to like level up and I have medicine to try to help me.
[37:26.33]Still not good enough for like anybody.
[37:30.27]They're all toxic.
[37:30.87]I'm already at 100% anyways.
[37:32.01]Are you desperate yet?
[37:37.39]Damn it.
[37:45.22]Headphones.
[37:50.60]I didn't even know.
[37:51.08]I didn't know these carried over.
[37:54.64]Look at how cool I look before I die.
[38:03.74]Eat the pig.
[38:07.06]No, I can't.
[38:07.48]I don't want to eat this pig.
[38:08.30]It's toxic.
[38:09.24]Is it not toxic yet?
[38:10.04]And it still is.
[38:12.90]Fucking god damn it.
[38:15.96]I'm dressed like a World War Z character.
[38:24.96]I have that bag of medicine.
[38:27.92]Man, it takes forever for an alligator to level up.
[38:30.28]That sucks.
[38:30.80]Are you desperate?
[38:33.72]Shit, she's desperate.
[38:35.79]Good.
[38:36.61]Good.
[38:36.97]Let's go.
[38:40.75]Make the next generation of useless, shitty dinosaurs.
[38:45.72]Come here.
[38:53.77]Okay, we're good.
[38:56.15]We need to wrap around now.
[38:57.41]I love how I came out like this.
[38:59.20]My father passed the clothing down.
[39:00.92]We got that.
[39:03.28]Let's see.
[39:04.02]Wrap around to the left.
[39:05.82]No, the Yogi Yogi Park west is nothing, but hopefully gonna be like a means to an end.
[39:09.40]Let's go left.
[39:14.26]They're howling.
[39:17.81]They are.
[39:23.05]Just like his dad.
[39:23.73]He was born with funny clothes.
[39:29.18]Get me out of the toxic place.
[39:32.18]Let me get some food.
[39:36.30]Mate again.
[39:38.38]Somehow we're at 25 years.
[39:39.54]Don't ask me how the fuck that happened.
[39:44.98]There's barely any food on that.
[39:46.24]There's barely any meat on that crow's bones.
[39:50.51]What's with the top-down perspective we have now?
[39:54.81]I, like, don't like this.
[39:55.59]Alright, what we got?
[39:59.13]That's a... God damn it.
[40:00.63]Is that, like, a... Is that a real lion, or is that, like, a fucking kid lion?
[40:04.62]I think that's a lion cub.
[40:05.56]That's not a real lion.
[40:07.54]Is it?
[40:09.14]It is.
[40:09.84]Fucking crocodile versus lion.
[40:11.12]Real king of the jungle.
[40:17.62]That's our first lion kill.
[40:21.46]Primo pet food.
[40:22.16]Good.
[40:26.76]His ability decreased due to heavy rain, and now we're toxic.
[40:32.62]So, if worse comes to worse, finally got a revenge on the lion.
[40:36.57]Killed the lion.
[40:37.73]Lion dead.
[40:43.67]King of the swamp.
[40:44.29]I think there was just one lion here.
[40:51.60]That's it.
[40:58.29]When's the next clown car video?
[41:04.62]It'll happen.
[41:05.26]I told you guys, I'm a man of my word.
[41:07.78]I will drive in a clown car at some point in a video.
[41:10.80]At some point.
[41:14.98]It's going to happen.
[41:20.74]I don't know when.
[41:21.34]I will.
[41:23.63]There's a love interest down here.
[41:29.55]I don't think I'm good enough.
[41:30.65]No.
[41:32.85]I don't think we need to change generations yet.
[41:34.45]There's no food over there.
[41:37.53]That's so stupid.
[41:39.64]I need to go to bed.
[41:43.18]I have to sleep up here.
[41:50.24]Might as well rest.
[41:50.88]Hopefully the rain goes away and more animals come over here.
[41:59.60]There it is.
[42:00.38]Desperate.
[42:00.76]Good.
[42:01.24]Let's go.
[42:05.80]Wait, what's over here?
[42:07.60]It's like a little hidden passage.
[42:08.84]No, I can't.
[42:10.16]So alligators can't go in any of the passageways, huh?
[42:16.37]Toxic mechanic is annoying?
[42:17.93]Yes, it is.
[42:20.27]It is very annoying.
[42:20.95]Alright, now what have we got for food?
[42:25.13]Any more food?
[42:27.31]Any new animals coming in here?
[42:30.53]I really hope that after sleeping that this area now has anybody.
[42:33.36]Okay, at least it has something for me to eat.
[42:34.94]Okay, let's go that way.
[42:41.16]Happy birthday, crocodile six.
[42:47.40]We got sixth graders?
[42:48.18]These are sixth graders, aren't they?
[42:49.34]Yeah, they are.
[42:55.27]I'm gonna have to eat that primo food.
[43:00.33]Oh well.
[43:02.81]I might be able to make it to, um... I might be able to make it to 50 years.
[43:06.88]If the... all the cards fall in the right area.
[43:13.40]If everything falls in place, I might make it to 50.
[43:17.30]I hope so.
[43:22.21]Okay, I got no more food or anything.
[43:26.97]I've not been able to even level up at all.
[43:28.37]This sucks.
[43:29.75]I need bigger animals.
[43:30.63]I need some real animals.
[43:35.11]Look at this fake shit.
[43:37.25]Now there's no more food in Yoyogi Park East.
[43:39.91]That's... That's great.
[43:43.52]That's great.
[43:44.28]I'm fucked here.
[43:46.72]I... Oh, lord.
[43:51.50]There's no way to go to the right.
[43:55.36]I think I have to go up into the... I have to go back.
[43:58.16]Otherwise, I'm just gonna die.
[43:59.14]There's no way I can make it through.
[44:00.12]I'm gonna go back.
[44:06.67]If I want any chance at all, I have to go all the way back to the left.
[44:11.29]There's plenty of animals if I play rank.
[44:24.58]Yeah, I gotta go back.
[44:33.18]No, I... Brink is gonna turn into another one of those things that everybody's just like, play Brink.
[44:38.58]It's gonna be the new Spore.
[44:43.06]It's not gonna stop until I play Brink for like 20 minutes.
[44:51.85]Here goes this guy.
[44:52.59]We're gonna lose this one.
[44:54.55]No food or anything, right?
[44:55.51]There's animals up here in... Okay, there's... Yamano West, there are animals.
[45:01.21]And there's, like, plenty of, like, food.
[45:02.71]So... Can I sleep here?
[45:05.85]Can't sleep in my parents' nest.
[45:07.85]Can I take control of my mother?
[45:13.59]Land!
[45:14.41]Ah!
[45:15.03]Land.
[45:15.33]Please land!
[45:15.87]It's not gonna happen.
[45:17.17]I gotta go.
[45:23.51]At least I have one more to make it through.
[45:28.47]Where are... Give me an animal, quick.
[45:30.31]Come on.
[45:32.55]Here we go.
[45:32.97]Animals.
[45:33.27]Is it gonna be enough time, though?
[45:37.77]What?
[45:38.05]No!
[45:38.55]I don't care about bottled water.
[45:40.67]Eat him!
[45:41.73]Eat him!
[45:42.99]Ah, yikes.
[45:43.65]That was close.
[45:45.21]Alright, bottled water is... Fills hunger, reduces toxicity.
[45:47.98]Alright, I'm gonna just chill for a minute.
[45:54.47]Okay, let's go.
[45:58.25]Why is everything so toxic?
[46:01.03]That sucks.
[46:03.17]Toxicity is a dump.
[46:05.35]Let's pick up a magazine.
[46:12.16]More water with water.
[46:12.90]I might have to drink some of that right now.
[46:18.42]I really do hate this toxic mechanic.
[46:20.60]You know, some things grow on you and some things just shave off.
[46:23.97]This is shaved off.
[46:26.95]And watch this.
[46:28.13]Let's take on the fucking second king of the jungle.
[46:31.85]The lion.
[46:33.03]Dead.
[46:33.23]Everything is instantly toxic.
[46:36.14]That's okay.
[46:36.80]Fine.
[46:38.66]Great.
[46:40.72]I have to drink this bottle of water.
[46:43.96]Or maybe not.
[46:44.60]I could save it until I desperately, actually, really, really desperately need it.
[46:47.88]I have one more person.
[46:58.99]I'm gonna use it.
[47:02.42]This guy is like, how am I gonna level up a single person, you know?
[47:08.05]I'll never get another level up if I don't do this.
[47:24.31]I want animals.
[47:26.29]Well, this is the most boring, like, 50-year survival I've ever had.
[47:29.76]Well, at least it's gonna happen, right?
[47:38.09]Thank you, Mr. Peppy.
[47:47.09]Back at 100% already.
[47:51.31]Get rid of the toxic element and bring in like diarrhea or something.
[47:55.53]You know?
[47:58.23]If when that got to 100 you just blew ass for like 30 seconds and you lost like 30% health, that'd be so much better.
[48:06.44]I gotta move.
[48:07.24]I can't even mate.
[48:08.46]It's not even worth it.
[48:12.20]I'm like starving.
[48:19.28]How is there this much food that I'm not seeing that's here?
[48:27.13]Come on!
[48:28.43]I'm so close!
[48:31.39]There's food somewhere over here.
[48:32.73]At least there's water.
[48:35.68]Alright, we're good.
[48:40.32]Back to 95% toxicity.
[48:41.24]Give me a break.
[48:42.98]Hippopotamuses?
[48:48.70]This would be a good place to level up.
[48:50.64]So I should get at least a couple of levels here.
[48:52.24]Everything is... Every fucking zone is toxic.
[48:55.28]What the fuck?
[48:56.62]Am I really just getting this screwed right now?
[48:58.74]Why is every single zone toxic?
[49:06.40]Tosser.
[49:11.21]I have to drink that other water.
[49:14.39]This is fucking dumb.
[49:20.81]Every single animal in this whole entire game is toxic.
[49:25.93]But I have to eat.
[49:26.77]So what's the solution here?
[49:29.08]Is this guy toxic?
[49:31.30]No, I can finally level up.
[49:35.22]Maybe he wasn't toxic.
[49:36.18]I can't really tell.
[49:36.80]No, he wasn't.
[49:39.64]Alright, good.
[49:42.87]That's another crocodile.
[49:43.81]Get out of here.
[49:44.31]You can't eat your own.
[49:45.13]Might as well just move on.
[49:56.80]Oh, a jackal?
[49:57.82]Good.
[49:58.18]Call him in.
[49:59.06]Good.
[49:59.28]This will be free food.
[50:02.30]I'm okay with this.
[50:02.96]This is like the easiest meal I've ever had.
[50:09.26]Now there's a fucking hippo involved.
[50:10.76]Where did you come from?
[50:15.51]That hippo was very brave, but very dumb, and it doesn't even matter.
[50:18.43]Free food.
[50:26.30]I gotta get another generation of veterans.
[50:28.46]Or at least a boss or something.
[50:32.08]Guess about the hippo.
[50:36.23]Oh shit, that's a lot of people.
[50:39.57]Zell.
[50:43.55]That's some food.
[50:44.41]That's a lot of free food.
[50:45.25]Eat it.
[50:50.78]Lots of calories.
[50:57.34]I should get to 4,000, there's a lot of animals here.
[51:03.08]What is fighting over here?
[51:03.80]What the fuck?
[51:05.42]What is fighting over here?
[51:11.04]Oh man, this is gonna be three fucking food.
[51:13.66]Look at this, there's like ten animals here.
[51:15.30]You think you can fuck with a crocodile?
[51:17.94]Nobody can.
[51:21.60]I'll just spam square.
[51:26.43]Here comes the first, like, crocodile boss.
[51:35.90]Well.
[51:37.40]Alright.
[51:38.88]There we are.
[51:39.30]That's good.
[51:45.31]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[51:46.67]Get to 4,000 calories and be a boss.
[51:51.03]I like killing animals.
[51:52.63]When you're an animal and you're fighting an animal and you're killing other animals to eat.
[51:55.35]Then whatever.
[51:59.55]Finally.
[52:02.51]Now I'm at the max rank.
[52:03.33]Don't have to worry about any of this shit.
[52:06.99]Hopefully there's a good female here.
[52:08.76]Alright, now we're gonna... One instant kill.
[52:14.10]I'm unstoppable.
[52:14.92]The king of the jungle now no longer is a threat at all.
[52:19.78]Remember how that used to scare me?
[52:21.32]That used to be terrifying when I was playing as a beagle.
[52:26.80]I told you guys this was cheating.
[52:29.63]There's no more danger anymore.
[52:30.93]What, like an elephant is gonna kill me now?
[52:33.61]What can possibly destroy me?
[52:35.09]Nothing.
[52:42.87]There is no fear anymore.
[52:46.59]Now we find a prime female.
[52:51.16]And we live.
[52:53.02]And we'll get to 50 years easily.
[52:55.97]Get to 100 years and then talk about danger?
[53:02.15]Prime female.
[53:03.07]Got it.
[53:03.33]This is going to be a great next generation.
[53:10.60]Prime female, prime male.
[53:18.02]Generation change complete.
[53:20.74]Survival points earned.
[53:24.40]Did I not get any increase or anything?
[53:28.56]Let's take a look.
[53:30.18]Now, of course, Yogi Park East has a million things to do.
[53:32.94]Alright, go to challenge.
[53:36.18]45 years.
[53:36.72]Mark four more times.
[53:41.79]There's no bosses or anything?
[53:43.13]I guess not.
[53:44.55]Alright, well, whatever.
[53:45.07]Let's go to
[53:48.13]I have like 15 years to do this.
[53:51.15]Active, mark 10 times, head for Shibuya suburbs.
[53:55.91]So we gotta go all the way down.
[53:58.51]This is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[54:02.39]All the way down, here we go.
[54:03.77]That's the quickest way to get there.
[54:05.69]Do I just go down?
[54:10.55]Yes I can.
[54:14.60]Fucking toxic.
[54:17.58]How annoying.
[54:18.90]I just... Wait.
[54:20.26]We're not down to the very end.
[54:21.32]Wait, what?
[54:22.64]What the hell was that?
[54:27.09]Did this place just become top?
[54:28.55]I think I'm confused right now.
[54:31.97]You came back and you saw a gator?
[54:33.25]Yes, you did.
[54:39.62]Let's go over there.
[54:44.44]Wait, what?
[54:46.26]How do I get out of here?
[54:51.08]How the fuck do I get out of here?
[54:53.49]I have to go all the way.
[54:54.35]Okay, I had to go that way.
[54:55.51]God damn it.
[55:01.77]That wasn't very clear for me.
[55:03.47]That's so annoying.
[55:08.01]One of my main complaints about this game is how there's only like one way to ever go any other direction.
[55:14.55]There's one spot you can go to the next zone.
[55:16.69]There should be like a couple.
[55:18.34]That's stupid.
[55:21.66]I still have like five brothers and sisters.
[55:27.92]There's that one specific route you have to take.
[55:30.08]And if you don't take it, then you can't go.
[55:33.24]Come on.
[55:34.92]Goodbye.
[55:35.32]He's dead.
[55:37.22]Let's put his clothes back on.
[55:50.45]Headphones.
[55:51.49]Raincoat.
[55:52.47]Yeah, raincoat's better.
[55:54.87]No shoes.
[55:56.21]We can't have a funny shoes alligator.
[55:57.88]That's unfortunate.
[56:02.02]At least there's something to eat.
[56:05.94]Pack of dogs.
[56:15.05]Eat up.
[56:20.64]There's one more over there, but he got away.
[56:21.98]It's alright.
[56:22.40]I don't even care.
[56:27.05]Don't care.
[56:29.13]Almost... This is as far as we've... What was the last... 40 years was as far as we've ever gone, right?
[56:37.94]I think that's one of my people that died.
[56:44.30]We need... Just go across.
[56:53.60]That might be the only food we see for a while, though.
[56:55.74]Treasure!
[56:56.08]Pet medicine is not food, unfortunately.
[57:01.86]What does the magazine do?
[57:05.06]I read it, but does it give me, like, extra stamina for, like, a few minutes or something?
[57:09.54]Let's go all the way over here.
[57:12.54]Get his food down there.
[57:13.24]We're good.
[57:18.56]At least there's a gazelle to eat.
[57:24.03]Yeah, probably.
[57:34.48]Last flag and then we go down to Shibuya.
[57:37.24]There's a lot of shit going on down there.
[57:39.08]I feel like that's gonna be where I lose.
[57:41.41]Is down in Shibuya Station.
[57:42.71]King of the jungle my ass.
[57:50.99]Instantly kill.
[57:51.63]Remember how I would do that and I would get latched on and it would be terrible?
[57:56.32]Now everything's toxic.
[57:57.38]That's great.
[58:05.18]Get out.
[58:06.76]Go dog.
[58:12.30]Easy.
[58:13.08]Yeah, the game is too easy now.
[58:15.30]When you buy the dollar DLC crocodile, the game just becomes too easy.
[58:24.19]That's too far, I don't care.
[58:27.93]This is the worst zone.
[58:29.38]I hate this place, so it's not worth doing it.
[58:34.22]We'll do another generation somewhere else.
[58:41.74]God damn it.
[58:44.56]I just wanna talk!
[58:48.44]Portable bed.
[58:52.30]Come here.
[58:53.62]Come here before I die.
[58:56.74]Stop running.
[59:00.44]Your fate is already sealed.
[59:02.12]You're not gonna do anything about it.
[59:03.26]You're just gonna die.
[59:04.18]Get the Super Pomeranian.
[59:08.15]No.
[59:14.97]Plus 10 attack.
[59:18.41]Yikes.
[59:19.09]Okay, that's really good.
[59:23.05]I think I know where to go.
[59:27.07]There's two.
[59:30.20]Eat these!
[59:33.66]Pet food, that's good.
[59:37.00]Am I finding more presents as the crocodile?
[59:42.71]Didn't see this many presents last time, I feel like.
[59:48.17]Not that I can remember.
[59:55.10]Alright, what do we got?
[59:57.44]Straight down.
[59:58.12]I'm gonna go through dogzaka.
[60:01.84]Not much in dogzaka, so a good thing I have food to bring.
[60:05.50]Not a prime male yet, so I'm not doing anything with that.
[60:08.40]Not messing around with that.
[60:09.42]We will eat one more time, though.
[60:11.84]Or I'll get stuck.
[60:13.12]Okay.
[60:13.50]Well, that was dumb.
[60:19.79]Golden Retriever.
[60:20.47]Easy.
[60:24.30]This game is cool.
[60:27.16]Yeah, it is.
[60:29.54]It is pretty cool.
[60:32.90]It's repetitive, but it just barely scratches enough of an itch where it's fun to play.
[60:40.26]Although, I guess I could maybe do without how overpowered my character is.
[60:43.51]It'd be cool if they made another one of these.
[60:50.17]Like, another Tokyo Jungle.
[60:51.89]Like, current gen.
[60:52.55]It'd be fun.
[61:00.83]Hopefully by the chance or the time that I get a female around, I'll be able to go.
[61:07.66]I'll be able to mate.
[61:14.58]Puppy Slayer of Tokyo.
[61:16.56]Yeah, this $1 DLC sure is paying off.
[61:22.39]Is this the most amount of points I've ever had?
[61:27.63]Dude, boys and girls, we might get to a hundred fucking years.
[61:31.35]This place is polluted, we gotta go.
[61:34.45]We gotta get the hell out of here.
[61:36.59]Should I mate?
[61:37.17]Maybe I will.
[61:39.95]Depends.
[61:41.25]Okay, if this person up here is at least average, if this is desperate, I'm leaving.
[61:46.09]No, get out of here.
[61:46.97]Bye.
[61:48.07]I still have food.
[61:48.91]I don't need to do that.
[61:49.49]I'm not gonna stay in the toxic zone.
[61:55.01]Yeah, we might get a hundred year stream here.
[62:01.76]All right.
[62:03.16]I'm gonna eat that food.
[62:05.62]Pet food.
[62:06.54]We're good.
[62:10.94]Don't have to worry about it.
[62:11.82]Hopefully there's food around.
[62:16.07]How old can alligators be?
[62:17.35]Can alligators even... I think alligators only live like eight years.
[62:25.51]One million years, Rick and Morty.
[62:26.94]100 years, Rick and Morty.
[62:30.34]Everyday.com.
[62:35.22]He was in the swamp.
[62:35.94]I had to get him.
[62:40.63]Eight years, Rick and Morty.
[62:44.75]Why the fuck does everything have to be toxic?
[62:53.12]Come on.
[62:56.74]They live 30 to 50 years?
[62:58.42]What?
[63:01.26]An alligator lives 50 years?
[63:02.78]They do not.
[63:06.89]An alligator only lives to be like six.
[63:09.35]It's like a big golden... It's like a big lab, right?
[63:11.97]Aren't they like labs?
[63:19.28]We're getting out of here.
[63:19.88]I'm getting out of the toxic zone.
[63:22.62]Screw that.
[63:23.58]I'm not even big enough or strong enough to have a female.
[63:27.82]No female's gonna like me.
[63:38.92]And everything's toxic here, too.
[63:41.23]That animal's toxic.
[63:41.97]What?
[63:42.33]Every zone is toxic.
[63:43.23]Okay, apparently I got some trophy, whatever that is.
[63:49.79]And the whole world's toxic.
[63:50.93]Everything.
[63:51.49]No matter where I go.
[63:52.45]Everything's just fucking... Holy shit!
[63:56.64]He fought back.
[63:57.50]What was that?
[63:58.92]What?
[64:01.96]Wow!
[64:02.80]Wow.
[64:03.42]Wow.
[64:03.92]No, no, no.
[64:04.50]We gotta live longer than Garfield.
[64:07.47]Oh, shit.
[64:15.37]Come on, give me an opportunity.
[64:16.97]Got it.
[64:19.19]That's a male and female lion here.
[64:20.60]Come on.
[64:27.04]He's knocked out.
[64:28.76]Whoa!
[64:32.18]Come on, give me an opportunity here.
[64:37.47]Come on!
[64:39.03]Damn it.
[64:39.39]I didn't get it fast enough.
[64:41.35]Got him.
[64:43.31]Oh my god.
[64:44.11]Okay, well, we lost two people.
[64:47.65]It is toxic, but this is going to get me to 4,000 probably.
[64:50.14]At least close.
[64:51.56]No.
[64:51.76]Okay, I'm going to hide now.
[64:54.74]That was fucking dangerous, man.
[64:57.90]What else is over here?
[64:58.50]Another line?
[64:58.98]If I sneak up and get this kill, I'll be a boss.
[65:02.00]Got it.
[65:04.16]Although, I am, like, toxic.
[65:07.38]Ah, not there yet.
[65:08.40]Shit.
[65:09.14]I forgot about clothes.
[65:19.81]No shoes.
[65:20.33]Okay, let's go.
[65:24.03]So, it seems that the world has gotten a little more dangerous down here, apparently.
[65:27.81]I only have one brother or sister.
[65:32.59]That means I have to be careful.
[65:33.71]We have to sneak around some more.
[65:34.79]That wasn't sneaky at all, but it's alright because now we're leveled up.
[65:50.95]Lions?
[65:51.47]No, hyenas.
[65:51.99]That's fine.
[65:53.89]Is there any medicine?
[66:04.91]Bring the whole fucking family.
[66:07.11]Or should you?
[66:07.63]There's a lot of you.
[66:08.69]There's a lot of you, actually.
[66:09.91]I don't know if I want to do this, and I'm toxic.
[66:12.44]Wait a minute.
[66:14.08]Restores life and reduces toxicity a lot with doing that.
[66:17.24]Zero percent.
[66:18.04]Okay, we're good.
[66:24.09]The whole fucking pack is here.
[66:32.89]I'm not going to eat any of these people.
[66:34.87]I'm already like a boss.
[66:35.79]Why would I do that?
[66:43.85]I'm a prime example of what you should be looking for in an 8.
[66:47.47]I need to eat one of them.
[66:49.35]Somebody has to be eaten.
[66:50.17]Can I get my hunger back?
[66:52.17]Okay, now let's go.
[66:53.85]I'm a big, big man.
[66:55.29]Alright, what are we looking for?
[66:56.08]Down.
[67:00.66]Almost at the coveted 50 years.
[67:04.83]All the way to the left.
[67:05.53]This sucks.
[67:06.75]Jesus Christ.
[67:07.65]Damn it.
[67:18.71]I'm so scared to get hit by that.
[67:19.91]What did he drop?
[67:26.77]He dropped a sun visor.
[67:31.25]Is that better than what I have on?
[67:34.07]No.
[67:38.83]Hide in the bushes.
[67:39.73]My head is so big.
[67:45.83]Lion cubs.
[67:46.57]Don't call your mother.
[67:47.81]Don't not get your mother involved, please.
[67:54.77]Look at the mini-map.
[67:56.63]I believe that's the mother.
[67:57.67]Just hanging out over there in the corner.
[68:00.39]Baseball cap.
[68:01.11]Is that better?
[68:08.56]No.
[68:09.00]It looks way stupider, but we have to have the extra protection here.
[68:17.66]Let's slow it down.
[68:18.92]A fucking cow?
[68:23.35]A dairy cow?
[68:26.25]That's the first time I've seen that.
[68:29.56]be a cow what a absolutely useless fucking animal to be in this game there's the father I don't want him I don't want him okay well we're gonna hide in the grass then okay well I can't jump over that so we're just gonna move oh shit this is where it gets real this is okay it just got real
[69:03.72]Damn it.
[69:05.34]Just missed it.
[69:11.39]Trying to run?
[69:12.89]Oh, come on.
[69:13.75]I hit, like, the fucking corner.
[69:16.73]Is this a random dairy cow watching?
[69:21.64]Ow!
[69:23.74]Ooh!
[69:29.08]Oh, no!
[69:30.47]No, no, no, no.
[69:31.45]I'm dead.
[69:32.63]Eat him!
[69:35.29]I gotta eat him and then what?
[69:36.37]Then what?
[69:36.65]I'm at 100% toxicity.
[69:37.79]What does the magazine do?
[69:38.67]What does the magazine do?
[69:44.58]That was a rock and a hard place.
[69:45.56]I would have got to 100% toxicity or did I?
[69:47.76]Is the magazine going to help me here?
[69:49.72]Is it going to drop my toxicity?
[69:51.36]I have no idea.
[69:56.92]Filthy with pep.
[70:00.54]It's just a porn magazine.
[70:03.72]This one's dead.
[70:05.78]Eat the book.
[70:06.34]I don't know.
[70:06.72]I don't... No.
[70:11.09]I'm just gonna die.
[70:12.27]I'm gonna get to the other guy.
[70:14.05]And he... How much health do I have?
[70:15.17]50% toxicity.
[70:29.77]Gimme it, gimme it, gimme it!
[70:31.72]He's running, okay, whatever, good.
[70:32.74]Go, go, go, go, go.
[70:34.08]Get out.
[70:35.58]Kill the fucking stupid dairy cow.
[70:39.38]That fucking stupid dumb corpse is in the way!
[70:41.24]Get the fuck out of the way!
[70:42.69]Oh, you almost blew it.
[70:43.63]You almost blew it there.
[70:48.77]Eat him.
[70:52.11]Put on the items.
[70:59.07]My pretty much last shot here.
[71:00.55]I have to get a mate.
[71:02.87]What do we got?
[71:03.37]We got two more opportunities.
[71:07.99]Just gotta get away from the lions.
[71:10.58]Already at the boss level, so we're good.
[71:12.90]I need a mate.
[71:13.40]I need to avoid conflict here.
[71:18.16]Avoid conflict.
[71:19.18]Don't get in any fights.
[71:20.22]Unless I need to eat.
[71:23.73]Oh, no.
[71:25.19]Please tell me this is not going to be...
[71:28.76]tigers or lions here.
[71:29.80]Alright, well, all the... Alright, it's just some hyenas.
[71:32.44]Are they gonna be immediately toxic?
[71:38.68]No, they're not.
[71:41.67]This is a good way to get it down.
[71:44.15]They're not instantly toxic.
[71:48.43]That's a good thing.
[71:50.53]It's not like it's helping any, though.
[71:55.83]I'm like, it's just so rapidly going up.
[72:06.83]I want to get this to, like, 40.
[72:08.59]And then go.
[72:13.03]Get to 40, and then we can mate and get the hell out of here.
[72:15.51]Let's go.
[72:18.45]Stop preying on the weak?
[72:19.33]That's what happens when you're in the jungle, man.
[72:22.07]It's every man for himself.
[72:25.25]If you don't want to die, you need to eat.
[72:30.39]How's my hunger not going down?
[72:36.08]Alright, we got an animal right here.
[72:38.60]It's prime.
[72:39.50]Prime female.
[72:41.06]We just gotta get up here.
[72:42.39]Okay, go.
[72:43.89]No, that is a blockade of some kind of animal that I don't want to fuck with.
[72:46.75]I'm gonna go the long way.
[72:56.97]Just get in here.
[72:59.14]Let's make some fucking babies.
[73:03.62]God fucking damn it.
[73:05.10]Okay, I have to... I can't get in there because I'm an alligator.
[73:08.50]What a crock of shit.
[73:11.34]I can't go in there.
[73:12.02]We have to go to the one all the way back here.
[73:13.20]And now I'm going to start to fucking die.
[73:19.13]This is so stupid.
[73:20.21]I don't know what this does, but I'm taking it.
[73:23.41]Alright, it actually was a good idea.
[73:32.16]Son of a bitch.
[73:32.94]It's the one that we just fought.
[73:34.76]Kill him, honey.
[73:36.88]Honey, kill him.
[73:38.70]Eat him.
[73:39.18]Good.
[73:39.70]Die.
[73:41.50]Don't even care.
[73:42.54]Life plus 40.
[73:43.16]Holy shit.
[73:45.85]Okay, that's good.
[73:54.35]Use portable bed?
[73:55.11]No.
[73:55.45]I'm not using portable bed.
[73:58.09]I'm using the portable bed when it gets to be, like, literally, like, desperate.
[74:03.35]I'm okay right now.
[74:04.57]We're still fine.
[74:06.21]This is not desperation.
[74:08.45]Portable bed is going to be necessary, like, let's say, like, another ten years.
[74:12.37]If I'm desperate and I'm going to die, I have to use that.
[74:14.97]I need to save it.
[74:17.35]Why would I use it?
[74:18.01]I'm going to be fine.
[74:18.63]I'm, like, right here.
[74:22.51]Like, here's the bed right here.
[74:28.39]The portable bed is for a desperate situation.
[74:34.57]Plus 20 life.
[74:36.15]That was a lot of pluses.
[74:37.76]I got a legit group now.
[74:40.22]Holy hell.
[74:40.88]Okay.
[74:42.84]Looks like we gotta go back up.
[74:48.18]Defeat 30 animals.
[74:49.50]Is there any other bosses or anything?
[74:52.72]Complete, complete, complete.
[74:54.02]Okay.
[74:54.12]Okay.
[74:56.18]So, we gotta go back up.
[74:57.79]There's nothing else for me down here.
[74:58.91]I gotta go back up.
[75:07.50]Got a crew.
[75:09.24]Got a gator gang.
[75:11.66]Past 50, we're at 54 years.
[75:13.54]Alright, Dagenzaka is polluted.
[75:23.58]Shibuya Station has a ton of food.
[75:25.13]Alright, we're gonna be fine.
[75:25.93]Is there sheep over here?
[75:30.29]Yeah, there is.
[75:32.89]Food!
[75:33.45]Even though it's gonna be toxic food, it's still food!
[75:42.08]Eat.
[75:46.22]That's not toxic, it's fine.
[75:49.76]Is it when the T-Rex is going to start spawning?
[75:51.42]Are we going to start to get to see some dinosaurs?
[75:53.07]It's been like 55 years.
[75:54.61]What's going on here?
[75:55.25]Where are the dinosaurs?
[76:04.95]It's a zebra.
[76:06.19]That's not a dinosaur.
[76:13.17]Mark it.
[76:18.21]Dinosaurs already died.
[76:21.86]Probably, maybe.
[76:22.36]I don't know.
[76:26.45]Gators are dinosaurs.
[76:27.61]Yeah, but they're not like the ones with the funny arms.
[76:29.87]And long legs.
[76:30.95]And like the turkey bodies.
[76:33.61]Alligators have the dinosaur face.
[76:34.99]They don't have the dinosaur turkey body.
[76:37.93]You know, the big like chickens.
[76:38.91]Like big chicken dinosaurs.
[76:42.18]Dinosaurs are just birds, guys.
[76:43.42]You know that?
[76:43.76]They're huge birds.
[76:51.19]Birds evolved from dinosaurs.
[77:03.51]Dinosaurs used to have feathers.
[77:06.98]It's true.
[77:07.36]Look, I'm serious.
[77:08.16]Like, that's like a real tiger.
[77:10.88]And he's scared of me.
[77:11.58]That's how you can tell that I'm like... That's how you can tell everybody's scared.
[77:16.32]King of the fucking jungle.
[77:17.94]Even the tiger is scared of me.
[77:32.75]I know about the podcast, yeah.
[77:34.93]I talked about it like an hour ago.
[77:36.87]Okay, I'm going to... That was the easiest thing in the world.
[77:42.61]I thought that was going to be at least a fight.
[77:49.03]Paleontologist.
[77:51.88]I really think we're going to make it through 100 years.
[77:53.32]There's Pomeranians.
[77:59.68]The funniest thing is these hyena animals are the only ones that have fought me.
[78:05.77]Even the tigers and lions, nobody wants to fight me.
[78:08.49]They did out of desperation that one time.
[78:12.84]That was it.
[78:23.05]Alright, occupied.
[78:23.99]I don't think I need to... I don't need to level up right now.
[78:29.65]This place is toxic, but every place is fucking toxic in this game.
[78:33.05]I didn't get him?
[78:37.59]Prime female?
[78:39.07]Prime female doesn't want anything to do with me, so we're just going to move on.
[78:43.56]Maybe after I kill this tiger, it'll be worth doing.
[78:49.90]Hunger plus eight.
[78:51.30]That's kind of insane actually.
[78:53.28]There's a buffalo.
[78:53.88]Water buffalo.
[78:54.44]There's a bear.
[78:55.06]First time I've ever seen a bear.
[78:56.86]Is the bear a man or is the bear a mouse?
[78:59.22]Bear is a man.
[79:02.57]Get him.
[79:07.29]What the fuck was that?
[79:09.19]What's wrong with all of us?
[79:11.62]We all like can't move.
[79:16.10]Bear is the scariest thing in the game, I guess, besides me.
[79:21.22]It's a fucking Pomeranian.
[79:22.48]Get out!
[79:22.78]Oh my god, we're gonna all die.
[79:26.72]Give me the kill this Pomeranian.
[79:30.00]Holy shit, that was close.
[79:31.22]Bring it down, right?
[79:39.13]Nice.
[79:39.75]Okay.
[79:43.83]I was toxic, but I had to do it.
[79:50.46]Do I need medicine or anything?
[79:51.34]No.
[79:56.34]Drop the toxicity, come on.
[80:00.23]Stamina jerky.
[80:01.05]I did, I dropped it a little.
[80:03.63]Alright, let's just get this in.
[80:05.57]That's like a horse.
[80:07.73]Oh, you're really fat.
[80:10.66]Thoroughbred!
[80:12.66]With a bear.
[80:15.91]You have to sneak up on the bears.
[80:17.59]Otherwise they're going to kill you every time.
[80:21.27]Mark this first.
[80:24.11]Every animal is a cheese noob.
[80:30.07]Are you toxic already?
[80:32.83]Yes, you are.
[80:33.23]Why do you get toxic already?
[80:36.38]Doesn't it take more than a few seconds?
[80:37.58]Let's see if we can insta-kill this bear.
[80:43.14]While he's distracted.
[80:46.22]Yeah, no.
[80:47.66]Not close enough.
[80:48.24]Come on.
[80:48.65]Come on while he's eating.
[80:52.47]Don't be toxic instantly.
[80:54.59]You are.
[80:55.17]That's such a poor shit.
[80:58.59]Whatever.
[81:02.07]If the animal's already toxic.
[81:03.33]Yeah, that stinks.
[81:05.78]Oh shit.
[81:07.84]Let me get a dodge.
[81:09.32]Dodge.
[81:20.18]Beagle.
[81:21.10]Nice job, Beagle.
[81:23.56]You almost did it.
[81:24.20]And here comes a panda bear.
[81:27.34]This is where the fucking animal fight happens.
[81:33.70]Okay, I'm dead.
[81:35.51]Somehow.
[81:38.33]We're all dead.
[81:40.43]Everybody died.
[81:42.13]Every single alligator died.
[81:43.55]Where?
[81:43.85]What?
[81:46.05]What?
[81:48.10]How did every fucking... I had four alligators.
[81:53.02]What?
[81:54.49]What just happened?
[82:04.99]Every single crocodile all died at the same time?
[82:08.14]Again?
[82:10.76]Well, we didn't make it through 100 years, unfortunately.
[82:18.54]That's what happens when you pay to win, noob.
[82:23.91]I guess we all insta-died.
[82:26.59]We got all one-shot by the panda.
[82:30.15]Look, it's even showing me the panda on the screen.
[82:32.57]Wait, did that just say I was number one?
[82:47.33]I was about to be talking about how I was number one.
[82:50.33]No, I'm 273,000.
[82:51.49]So who's number one?
[82:58.82]Daily.
[82:59.68]Excuse me.
[83:00.28]21 in the world.
[83:02.04]Alright, who's the number one ever?
[83:09.72]We gotta go all the way up.
[83:11.10]Let's go to first.
[83:13.50]Okay.
[83:14.38]These are obviously, fuck, these are obviously, like, hackers.
[83:16.50]Okay?
[83:16.87]Like, 999999- no. With like a gazelle? Sorry, you're hacking.
[83:21.87]Where's the guy with like 999998? Like the guy that didn't hack the game.
[83:30.87]We gotta find the first guy that didn't hack the videogame.
[83:40.87]Okay, here we go.
[83:43.58]He's the real guy in first place.
[83:50.93]And then there's me.
[83:54.03]Pomeranian.
[83:54.65]Everyone's doing this with a rabbit.
[83:59.35]Alright, so... Hold on a minute.
[84:00.69]Let me check one thing before we go.
[84:02.36]Whoops.
[84:07.28]So where... Let me go...
[84:13.34]We're gonna go get the human, okay?
[84:15.90]I will do the human once, but I need to figure out where the hell that even is.
[84:19.95]I have to go to, like, the PlayStation Store.
[84:27.41]Like, am I gonna back out somehow?
[84:32.50]Back, uh, cancel, yeah.
[84:33.70]How do I get out of here?
[84:37.88]I can't, like, back out.
[84:40.60]Let's go get the human.
[84:41.64]We're going to end the stream with the human.
[84:42.88]I'll just run around to see what it's like.
[84:49.74]I actually can't leave the game.
[84:52.71]The middle button, the PS4 middle button doesn't do anything.
[85:00.11]Well, hold on.
[85:00.75]Give me a second.
[85:07.64]Force quit it.
[85:09.28]But if you're going to take off, thanks for sticking around.
[85:11.88]We're going to do this one last thing and then we'll stop the stream.
[85:17.19]Hold on.
[85:17.61]How much money is this?
[85:20.67]Am I spending more money on this game?
[85:27.65]PlayStation Store.
[85:30.85]Are they naked?
[85:33.49]It'd be weird if they were.
[85:41.74]Another tape joke incoming.
[85:43.38]No.
[85:44.62]Not doing another tape joke.
[85:51.41]So tomorrow I've got a long list of things to play.
[85:58.35]As you saw them all in the background.
[86:04.07]Or there's a possibility that I might play something with italics.
[86:09.37]To Alex and me, we're talking about it.
[86:11.53]Not sure exactly what we're going to do, but let's go to add-ons.
[86:16.23]I need to filter here.
[86:19.43]Search.
[86:20.21]Let's just type in Tokyo Jungle.
[86:26.30]I forgot about the old PSN thing where you have to go search the letters and scroll down with the letters.
[86:38.32]Here we go.
[86:38.64]Tokyo Jungle.
[86:42.17]It's an add-on.
[86:43.31]Where?
[86:44.81]Add-ons.
[86:46.33]26 add-ons.
[86:49.87]Animal characters.
[86:50.57]Animal characters.
[86:51.47]Oh, man.
[86:53.79]Businessman.
[86:54.64]Oh, here we go.
[86:57.68]What are... Some of these are fucking weird.
[87:00.18]Some of these are weird.
[87:03.46]There's the businessman.
[87:04.20]We're going to buy it.
[87:04.72]I already have the crocodile.
[87:08.97]There's this guy called Homo Erectus.
[87:13.45]Mannequin.
[87:18.45]This is going down a rabbit hole.
[87:19.59]I don't want to go down.
[87:20.19]We're going to place the businessman.
[87:24.79]It's just a regular guy.
[87:26.35]It's just a guy in a suit.
[87:27.53]That's it.
[87:35.94]Hold on.
[87:36.36]Almost there.
[87:40.07]Proceed to checkout.
[87:42.29]Confirm it.
[87:45.79]Here you go.
[87:46.63]Here's your final Tokyo Jungle appearance.
[87:50.43]You want to get my final thoughts on Tokyo Jungle?
[87:52.94]Fun.
[87:55.42]It's fun.
[87:56.20]It's a fun game.
[87:57.70]I highly recommend it if you're just looking for something to do in the background.
[88:02.38]But that means you have to have a PlayStation 3 and you have to have a PlayStation 3 turned on.
[88:07.39]So.
[88:09.33]Right.
[88:12.09]If it's fun, if you want to hook up your PlayStation 3, then go for it.
[88:17.65]I'm going to put this game back in.
[88:20.71]I should have it installed.
[88:21.51]It said it's installed.
[88:23.83]Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[88:26.17]Open it up.
[88:26.73]Exit the store.
[88:27.43]Okay.
[88:27.79]Throw it back in the disc.
[88:34.59]And let's switch over to it again.
[88:35.71]Is it going to work?
[88:39.33]Come on.
[88:41.67]The game is really good to be honest.
[88:42.71]Fun co-op.
[88:43.17]All jokes aside.
[88:44.77]It seems very grindy.
[88:47.79]But not in a terrible way.
[88:49.87]It just seems like fun.
[88:50.93]There's all kinds of animals.
[88:53.48]Obviously there's the interesting weird dinosaurs and crocodiles and shit.
[88:59.68]That's cool.
[89:03.78]And no signal.
[89:04.60]I knew it was going to happen.
[89:05.48]I shouldn't have switched over that quickly.
[89:09.51]Now it's ready.
[89:12.67]No, it's not.
[89:13.69]Now it is.
[89:18.55]You think it's awesome?
[89:19.31]Yeah, it is on the PS Now.
[89:21.73]The only reason why I wouldn't recommend it on PS Now is because PS Now is really finicky.
[89:27.44]It's like just streaming the game to your PS4, but I mean, that's a good place to do it.
[89:40.63]It is available on PS Now.
[89:42.79]But you have to have a really strong wired connection if you really want to enjoy PS Now.
[89:52.21]A handful of the games that I bought are actually on PS Now, but it's just not something I can do.
[89:56.66]I don't have a wired connection down here.
[90:01.22]Alright, let's take a look at the human.
[90:06.58]There he is.
[90:07.10]There's an office worker.
[90:08.62]It's an herbivore.
[90:12.40]What?
[90:14.44]Why is this an herbivore?
[90:15.46]I can't eat any meat?
[90:22.39]That's stupid.
[90:23.13]I have to, like, play as an herbivore.
[90:24.47]Oh, God.
[90:31.73]What about the mating?
[90:33.23]Do you, like, mount people?
[90:36.43]Alright, I'm interested for a second here.
[90:38.15]Like, I think you mount people.
[90:43.56]I don't have to eat?
[90:44.22]Okay, we have to avoid animals.
[90:45.71]Oh, lord.
[90:47.99]Okay, what can I, like... I can't eat them, though.
[90:55.91]Alright, well, whatever.
[90:58.45]We have to claim the territory.
[90:59.71]That's a great running animation.
[91:07.27]Yeah, it is.
[91:10.09]I'm almost not a rookie.
[91:12.69]So here's the thing.
[91:13.65]Is there a female model?
[91:16.45]Is there an actual character?
[91:18.29]Like a female?
[91:19.55]Or is it another office worker guy?
[91:23.96]I'm sure we'll find that out in a few seconds.
[91:32.50]Ranked up.
[91:40.94]How am I ever going to fight a lion like this?
[91:42.54]I don't know how.
[91:49.22]I guess it's kind of... It seems to be a little easier to play this game as an herbivore.
[91:56.57]It's harder to kill things, but you don't have to worry about, like, eating food.
[91:59.23]Like, actually killing things and eating.
[92:01.69]What do we got?
[92:07.95]All the way that we got to go this way.
[92:13.31]Man vs. Wild Part 2, that's right.
[92:21.23]As he murders two rabbits.
[92:22.37]Well, I just wanted to see the fighting animation, right?
[92:24.85]It's important to know what it looks like.
[92:27.29]Can you drink water?
[92:30.40]Alright, I didn't know if the human wouldn't drink the dirty water.
[92:34.10]Apparently he does.
[92:40.36]Tokyo Jungle.
[92:45.57]I'm just gonna sneak around.
[92:46.37]Humans are like the best at sneaking.
[92:51.38]One more.
[92:53.34]Let's kill that chicken.
[92:58.14]For no reason, because I'm a monster.
[92:59.82]Alright, let's mate.
[93:02.68]You can now use the nest.
[93:15.24]So wait a minute.
[93:17.80]There's no love interests.
[93:21.03]Do I not mate as a human?
[93:23.37]So how do you get another generation?
[93:26.91]I'm not just gonna shit out a baby, am I?
[93:31.03]No mates.
[93:33.25]So what?
[93:35.81]Sleep.
[93:37.24]So there's no other generations.
[93:39.14]It's just this one guy.
[93:44.24]It's just this guy that's all right that You're not sleep all right.
[93:50.92]I don't love that's all right cool.
[93:53.35]We got to see the human Now I need it.
[94:00.01]I'm gonna starve to death.
[94:00.91]There's no more plants So we're gonna go down.
[94:04.89]Oh, we're gonna go left I'm gonna starve to death as this guy right now
[94:13.78]The only man left on Earth.
[94:16.68]And all he eats is plants, when there's plenty of good food around, like rabbits and... and fucking chickens and beagles, like there's plenty of food to eat, but he won't eat it.
[94:26.67]He would rather die as the last man on Earth.
[94:33.93]No, there we go.
[94:36.19]I'm gonna get eaten by like a lion or something.
[94:43.79]water water water level five vegan so when you get to a boss what happens you just don't does it take much longer to get to the highest level as a human then
[95:12.21]You can easily cook these rabbits.
[95:13.63]I don't know what his problem is.
[95:18.22]Even the rabbits are fighting back, and I can't do anything about it.
[95:22.56]I've never seen a rabbit fight in this game.
[95:25.41]Yet, here we are.
[95:34.24]Now we're safe.
[95:40.41]Wasted money.
[95:41.47]It was only a dollar.
[95:42.33]It wasn't that expensive.
[95:43.39]Alright, a bunch of sheep.
[95:47.39]Sheep are running from... I'm not entirely sure what they're running from, but whatever.
[95:57.86]I'm getting close to being leveled up.
[96:07.51]Get the fuck out of there.
[96:08.87]Goodbye.
[96:10.63]No, I need to see what happens when you get to boss.
[96:13.81]No, don't get killed by an alligator.
[96:15.28]Not this way.
[96:19.22]You can't kill him.
[96:19.98]There's no way I'm gonna win.
[96:22.28]Now this fucking dog's chasing me.
[96:25.74]Alright, I gotta run.
[96:31.84]Watch out.
[96:32.64]Watch out.
[96:33.00]What am I scratching?
[96:34.22]Do I have fleas?
[96:34.92]I'm dead.
[96:35.66]Alright, thanks everybody for watching.
[96:38.43]No getting out of this one.
[96:44.47]Where am I going?
[96:47.35]They're still chasing me.
[96:48.41]Leave me the fuck alone!
[96:52.07]The crocodile is still up here, chasing.
[96:54.91]Alright, no, I'm good.
[96:57.22]I just want to see what happens when you get to boss.
[97:03.54]A couple of gazelles, then nothing.
[97:12.59]This guy sucks.
[97:22.32]This fucking guy.
[97:23.34]This guy sucks, man.
[97:24.94]Like, this guy sucks.
[97:25.84]Can I please now?
[97:26.70]That's good.
[97:34.43]Alright, what have I got to do?
[97:37.01]Find the gazelle boss.
[97:39.75]In the suburbs.
[97:43.91]Reach the shop district, find the post office.
[97:46.26]I mean, there's a boss, but I don't really care about the gazelle boss.
[97:53.10]I could care less.
[97:59.19]Can he climb ladders?
[98:03.53]No, I can't.
[98:05.07]I think the same rules apply.
[98:06.65]Whether or not you're a human or an animal, the same rules apply.
[98:10.99]What is he saying, by the way?
[98:13.10]What is Mosso?
[98:13.78]Mosso, Mosso, Mosso, Mosso.
[98:16.74]What's that mean?
[98:20.50]Can't just sleep in the nest.
[98:23.98]I have to kill the crocodile to end the stream.
[98:26.42]It's not going to happen.
[98:27.18]Why is there a bear over here?
[98:30.23]That seems like an odd place for a bear.
[98:32.59]Well, I'm scratching my zits, and I can't, like... Alright, we're good.
[98:39.94]Woo!
[98:41.62]He can't come up here.
[98:42.36]Alright.
[98:43.78]Nope, he can come up here.
[98:45.26]He actually can come up here.
[98:48.42]Kill the bear?
[98:48.98]Alright, I'll try to kill the bear to end the stream.
[98:59.22]We're gonna see man versus wild.
[99:04.76]Stop scratching.
[99:08.22]There's no fucking way.
[99:26.63]He's gonna charge.
[99:27.33]He's gonna charge.
[99:31.97]There's no way, guys.
[99:33.01]Like, it's just not possible.
[99:34.03]I'm dead.
[99:35.91]How am I supposed to beat this?
[99:37.31]And he's going to eat me.
[99:40.52]No.
[99:40.84]That fleas and shit.
[99:42.28]No.
[99:42.80]That's not going to happen.
[99:43.52]It's not possible.
[99:47.24]Well, there you go.
[99:50.16]Use my Estus.
[99:52.28]I would have if I had one.
[99:56.00]Alright.
[99:57.06]That's going to be it.
[100:00.52]He's retired.
[100:01.94]That's going to be the end of Tokyo Jungle, by the way.
[100:04.72]So, if you like what you see, then you can get it on PS Now.
[100:10.56]No Dynasty.
[100:12.07]It'll be more of the same.
[100:12.79]I mean, I wasn't looking for a full run there.
[100:18.35]I just wanted to see what it was like.
[100:21.11]Because I'm going to get out of here.
[100:23.11]So, say goodbye to Tokyo Jungle.

[102:24.51]College cafeteria food is actually pretty good.
[102:28.36]I've had plenty of college meals.
[102:30.90]And I loved all of them.
[102:32.38]I wouldn't consider that a school lunch.

[104:21.59]Oh my god.
[104:33.53]We're not stopping.
[104:37.25]Just fucking stomp on all these animals.
[104:40.45]The giraffe is seriously the most powerful being to ever exist in the animal kingdom.
[104:46.46]We don't even need to eat food.
[104:48.62]Where are you little fucking kitties?
[104:49.84]I was like, just find a dinosaur and fight it.
[104:54.41]Get the fuck out of here.
[104:57.01]The true dinosaur.
[105:04.38]Danger from a pig.
[105:05.56]Let's go, pig.
[105:06.08]Ain't got shit.
[105:08.48]Alright, fine.
[105:08.86]I'll eat something.
[105:11.55]Eat.
[105:12.37]Eat it.
[105:14.33]That's okay.
[105:14.69]Eat it again.
[105:16.29]We're gonna find the first real animal to fight.
[105:24.11]Am I gonna die from a cat?
[105:25.93]I hope so.
[105:26.43]I hope so.
[105:32.35]A clean kill.
[105:35.68]Why won't anybody fight me?
[105:36.88]Alright, a chicken is fighting me.
[105:38.04]A little baby chick is fighting back.
[105:39.36]Giraffe versus crocodile?
[105:43.46]I have to find a crocodile.
[105:44.38]And I'm just trying to speedrun to it.
[105:51.69]Are you really that sloppy that you can't find a way to eat this?
[105:53.47]Come on.
[105:55.49]Oh, there's no... Why is it... Wait, wait, wait.
[105:57.07]There's no game sound.
[105:58.07]You couldn't hear this?
[106:03.02]Why was the game sound turned off?
[106:04.55]That was the whole joke here, was this.
[106:11.27]How come nobody told me?
[106:15.96]That was the whole joke, and it's ruined.
[106:19.98]That's why I said it was like a horn.
[106:21.24]Oh, goddammit.
[106:22.85]Alright, where are we?
[106:23.99]All the way to the left, go.
[106:36.50]Can I put clothes on?
[106:37.74]What am I thinking?
[106:38.26]I gotta put, like, fucking clothes on him.
[106:39.64]Alright, definitely the green hat.
[106:47.32]And his t-shirt.
[106:50.39]Here we go.
[106:50.81]Here's my fursona.
[106:56.79]We're all the way down already.
[106:58.71]Somebody kill me!
[107:03.21]There's nobody here to kill me.
[107:05.39]There's this one crow that's sitting on this ledge.
[107:07.25]It's not gonna do anything.
[107:13.03]Oh, well.
[107:14.45]Alright, well, that's it.
[107:15.97]Thanks for watching.
[107:17.53]No, I have to fucking find a crocodile.
[107:18.99]Come on.
[107:19.45]This is a secret stream.
[107:24.94]I'm gonna go all the way over here.
[107:35.69]Here we go.
[107:36.93]Four, three crocodiles.
[107:40.82]No, it's not even a fucking crocodile.
[107:42.20]Just get over here.
[107:42.96]Somebody fight me!
[107:43.70]Why is everybody such a wuss?
