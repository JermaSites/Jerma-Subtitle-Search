[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.20]Hello Descenters, my name is Etalyx and I am here today with some Team Fortress 2 to show you.
[00:10.80]The Man vs Machine update has just recently released and I've got some gameplay for you.
[00:16.28]Going to have a pretty lengthy video here, but that is because it's going to be mostly a live commentary.
[00:21.37]Now, if you couldn't tell, this is a post-commentary.
[00:23.13]I've already played this game that you are watching here.
[00:25.03]I wanted to explain briefly
[00:27.09]how this new game mode in Team Fortress 2 works.
[00:30.37]Well, what the update actually brought with it were no new weapons, but they do have some new cosmetic items, but there are three new maps, and on those three maps is a new game type.
[00:39.28]It's basically a horde mode, and what that means is that you're going to be facing off against waves of robotic enemies, and all of these robotic enemies are gonna be taking the shape and form of one of the classes of Team Fortress 2, so
[00:51.65]Right now we're facing off against what appear to be some heavies and some scouts and all that stuff.
[00:57.19]All the classes are represented over time and I don't know if the waves are completely random.
[01:01.44]It certainly seems that way.
[01:03.16]You might be facing off against a wave of 50 robotic scouts with baseball bats charging you.
[01:08.04]They might have shotguns.
[01:09.20]You might be facing off against boxing glove heavies.
[01:11.36]You might be facing off against giant versions of those classes.
[01:15.09]So I want to let the gameplay kind of speak for itself, so I'm not going to go into too much more detail.
[01:18.93]I do want to let you know, between waves, and you saw we just completed wave one right there, we're going to be returning back to the spawn.
[01:26.02]And at the spawn, we're actually going to be able to upgrade each of our characters.
[01:30.34]I am playing as an engineer and I've got the JAG in my hand right now.
[01:33.77]I've also got the Frontier Justice and the Wrangler.
[01:36.31]What the Wrangler allows me to do is a little joystick that you were seeing me use a second ago.
[01:40.03]It allows me to actually control the direction of the sentry and fire it myself.
[01:45.28]So I'm going to be hitting the sentry a lot to refill the ammo, and I'm going to be controlling where it's shooting with the Wrangler, and that's going to be my primary method of dispatching of these crazy robots.
[01:54.89]Now in between rounds, as I mentioned, we do get to upgrade, and I'm going to the resupply here, run up against this little window here, and I can select which weapon I want to upgrade.
[02:02.37]Now what's awesome about this is that nearly every item from each of the character classes is represented here, so what I could do if I wanted to, with the credits I'm earning from each round, I can level up my weapons and my person
[02:13.70]Note this is temporary, this is not going to carry over into any multiplayer matches.
[02:17.19]So if I want to regenerate health, I can go over to my character tab and upgrade my ability to regenerate health per second.
[02:23.85]If I want to make my shotgun stronger, I can do that.
[02:26.74]If I want to make my dispenser reach longer so that people can be healed from a further distance away from my
[02:32.20]dispenser I can do that if I want to make the century fire faster I can do that as well hopefully you guys get the idea and this will apply to each class so if you want to be a crazy sniper Huntsman who just shoots his bow and arrow as fast as he possibly can you can do that if you want to be a Demoknight which I was in a different game you can swing your sword extremely fast and get crits each time you get a kill there's just so many opportunities here to play different styles and it really livens up this game mode and makes it something special yes
[03:00.64]This type of game mode has been done many, many, many times before, but it's extra fun now that it's in Team Fortress 2.
[03:05.96]And like I said, the upgrade system itself is what really is the driving factor, in my opinion.
[03:10.88]Had a ton of fun with this game, and I look forward to playing it some more and unlocking hopefully some of the cosmetic items.
[03:16.52]What you should know is there are two different ways to play.
[03:19.04]If you want to play on one of the official servers, you're going to have to buy what amounts to a golden ticket.
[03:24.62]I don't remember exactly what they're called, but there are two different types of tickets.
[03:28.68]The basic ticket is $1, and what that'll let you do is play on the official server, and you can play up to six players in co-op, and when you finish a game, if you win, you will get a cosmetic item.
[03:40.71]Now, that ticket will then be gone.
[03:42.45]The way I understand it is if you lose, you stick it to keep your ticket and try again until you get something, so you're guaranteed to get at least one cosmetic item.
[03:49.05]However, if that's not your cup of tea, if you don't want to pay for anything, that's perfectly understandable.
[03:52.93]All you have to do is play on one of the community servers, and that is one of the normal standard servers, not one of the official Valve servers, that are running one of these maps and one of these game types, and you can do so without being able to unlock one of the new cosmetic items.
[04:07.48]So, yes, feel free to discuss that in the comments below.
[04:09.62]I want to know what you guys think about that.
[04:11.34]Is it a step too far, or is it understandable considering this is a free update anyways?
[04:16.32]Let me know what you think below.
[04:17.72]But anyways, I'm going to switch back over to the live comm now, playing with some of my best buddies,
[04:22.61]in this game, so check them out in the description below this video if you want to see their YouTube channels.
[04:28.09]Thanks for watching guys, hope you enjoy!
[04:46.93]A+.
[04:48.03]Nice.
[04:48.85]Bonus.
[04:49.67]Beautiful.
[04:50.47]That was a beautiful thing.
[04:51.67]When you use the Buffalo Steak Sandvich, you cannot use your minigun.
[04:57.31]You can only use your gloves.
[04:58.97]Oh yeah, it's melee only.
[05:00.78]There might be an upgrade for it to take away the melee only portion.
[05:03.28]I'm going to change a weapon.
[05:08.38]Just something to my loadout.
[05:09.60]Because I'm a nub.
[05:10.44]How do you change one?
[05:13.12]Can I change something to my loadout?
[05:15.48]You'll lose all your money.
[05:16.62]You'll lose everything.
[05:17.30]You have to start from the beginning.
[05:18.58]Oh, that sucks.
[05:19.50]I mean, you can, but it's at the cost of losing all you've done so far.
[05:24.22]Oh, no.
[05:24.56]It just changed for me now.
[05:25.92]That's cool.
[05:26.68]That's all gone with my stuff.
[05:30.22]There, that's what I wanted.
[05:31.41]Mad Milk.
[05:31.91]I can reduce their speed.
[05:32.83]Ooh, metal regen.
[05:36.01]Yes, please.
[05:36.51]Alright, there's a tank here.
[05:39.17]Oh, ready for it.
[05:42.63]Ready up, boys.
[05:45.12]So they just get infinite... Oh, sorry.
[05:47.46]They just get infinite scouts and spies until we kill the tank, right?
[05:51.86]I don't know.
[05:54.78]Oh, I should get out of your way.
[05:56.98]So what buttons... Uh-oh!
[05:58.54]I just destroyed my sentry!
[06:00.06]Nice!
[06:02.78]Lag all over the place.
[06:06.34]It's okay, just hold them off.
[06:09.46]Alright, I'm using my crits.
[06:12.08]I was trying to figure out how do you use the crits?
[06:15.99]Oh man, that's beautiful.
[06:18.27]No, I didn't mean to taunt!
[06:19.89]How do you use crits?
[06:20.57]I want to use my crits.
[06:21.85]Here comes lag.
[06:23.11]Oh my gosh, lag.
[06:24.95]Scouts are coming.
[06:25.59]After you equip it, it's H. Can I get... I'll work on these guys.
[06:29.35]There we go.
[06:32.35]Oh my goodness.
[06:33.05]Wow, this is bad.
[06:33.73]We lag.
[06:35.50]Spies.
[06:36.08]I think it's server crashing?
[06:37.46]No.
[06:38.24]They got the bomb.
[06:39.70]There's spies here.
[06:40.56]Oh, spies are taking...
[06:43.94]Oh, is this a spy right here?
[06:45.58]The shibby spy?
[06:46.06]Yeah, spy shibby.
[06:47.18]Spy shibby!
[06:47.72]Come on!
[06:51.49]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[06:52.65]That's not good.
[06:55.63]Get it!
[06:55.93]Oh no, this thing's gonna get by.
[06:57.29]This thing's gonna get by.
[06:58.15]Alright, I'm using a Buff Banner, everyone shoot.
[07:03.64]Oh, I got no ammo.
[07:05.70]Gotta reload all my guns.
[07:13.01]Oh, that Buff Banner is so ridiculous here.
[07:16.74]Oh, there's so many scouts!
[07:18.06]Oh, I'm like taking damage from something.
[07:20.32]There's so many scouts!
[07:22.78]Oh no!
[07:25.86]It's almost out, we got this.
[07:27.16]Yeah, it's good.
[07:29.24]Oh wow, that was amazing.
[07:32.35]And the lag is also amazing.
[07:34.35]Uh oh.
[07:37.53]Server's gone.
[07:38.17]Oh no!
[07:39.23]Oh my gosh.
[07:41.13]Oh.
[07:42.11]Let's create a shaking.
[07:43.45]Yeah, we're so we're not getting the cash.
[07:46.61]Oh, yeah.
[07:47.99]Oh, nine hundred plus.
[07:49.93]Nice.
[07:53.89]I'm not going to lie.
[07:54.55]I have almost hit B to like teleport back to base like three times.
[07:58.81]I was thinking of making the joke.
[08:03.85]It's not a joke.
[08:05.21]Mm hmm.
[08:06.91]That's what they all say.
[08:10.14]Oh, you can only have one... Oh.
[08:13.08]Okay.
[08:16.62]This sword is unbelievable now.
[08:18.02]If I can just, like, stand there and smash people.
[08:20.59]Oh, boy.
[08:22.25]Can you upgrade, like, the splint screen just to be, like, a beast shield?
[08:26.69]I probably... I don't know.
[08:28.51]I don't have it equipped.
[08:30.11]Also, can you upgrade the island to give you massive health?
[08:33.81]See, yeah, I would assume.
[08:35.55]I mean, I have the... Oh, this is so laggy.
[08:38.94]I have on the, um, Satoichi.
[08:42.07]And one of the things, one of the things is, is just guaranteed, if you kill somebody, guaranteed crits for two seconds, four seconds, six seconds.
[08:48.35]Oh, wow.
[08:49.67]So you pretty much will be unkillable.
[08:51.19]I just walk around, just insta-kill, like, all the little guys down there.
[08:54.01]Oh, my gosh.
[08:55.03]Look how fast I can fire this Huntsman.
[08:57.97]That there wouldn't get any, any, any, any.
[09:03.10]That there wouldn't get any ladder.
[09:05.50]That there wouldn't get any, any, any.
[09:10.75]I sense lag.
[09:13.42]Yeah, this kid is gonna... I'm not gonna be able to hit those scouts.
[09:18.42]Why is he standing still?
[09:22.98]And... And here they come with all the rockets.
[09:25.88]I'm just firing a bullet at them.
[09:26.84]Shoot those rockets, John.
[09:28.57]I'm trying.
[09:29.19]They're all over the place.
[09:30.57]Ow, what is hitting me?
[09:31.41]Are they snipers?
[09:32.31]Are they snipers?
[09:35.19]Yeah, they have snipers.
[09:37.59]They have snipers.
[09:38.31]Oh, yeah, snipers.
[09:39.41]Crazy.
[09:39.79]Snipers got me.
[09:42.40]Oh my god.
[09:45.97]Dude, upgrading weapons is so fun.
[09:48.81]We need money, though.
[09:49.61]Like, yeah, get in there, boo.
[09:50.63]There you go.
[09:51.63]Dance.
[09:52.57]Dance, boo.
[09:53.15]Dance.
[09:54.27]I think my Mad Milk overheals me when I kill him.
[09:59.30]Okay, I'm back.
[10:00.48]Let's do this.
[10:01.02]Oh my god, it's just chaos.
[10:06.60]Oh my god, the amount of nades that are coming out right now.
[10:09.64]Oh, sentry buster, move that sentry if you can.
[10:12.06]Oh no.
[10:12.54]Adam, we got him, we got him, we got the sentry.
[10:14.30]Buster.
[10:15.78]Oh, man!
[10:16.76]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[10:18.60]Oh, he's got smoke.
[10:21.67]I'm slowing down in the middle.
[10:23.81]Oh, Natascha's a good idea, actually.
[10:26.83]I'm out of health.
[10:28.57]Oh, my God.
[10:30.61]This guy.
[10:32.07]Oh, man, he's direct shotting me.
[10:35.35]They're going the other way.
[10:36.17]They're going the other way.
[10:37.43]They're going the other way.
[10:38.01]Okay, it's all good.
[10:38.55]It's all good.
[10:40.01]Oh, my sentry almost died.
[10:41.79]Sentry buster.
[10:42.69]Sentry buster.
[10:45.75]Oh, lord.
[10:46.13]Your sentry's going down.
[10:46.93]Oh, no.
[10:47.61]Good call.
[10:47.91]Good call.
[10:48.37]He's dead.
[10:48.91]He's dead.
[10:49.21]Strong play.
[10:50.51]Get all the money.
[10:50.95]Oh, there's so many grenades, though.
[10:52.67]I'm dead.
[10:54.25]Oh, he got one direct shot.
[10:55.45]That guy just owned me.
[10:57.45]Coming.
[10:59.57]Oh, unload these.
[11:00.85]Oh, man.
[11:01.90]Who's left?
[11:02.34]I'm out of ammo.
[11:07.76]Man, he's nice.
[11:08.87]He's way complete.
[11:10.39]Do we miss anything?
[11:11.17]Oh, quick, get money, get money, get money.
[11:13.19]You can still get money.
[11:14.55]Can you still grab it?
[11:15.77]Yeah, but not anymore, I don't think.
[11:17.57]It's alright, whatever.
[11:18.43]It's all gone.
[11:19.57]How do you use the canteen?
[11:22.63]H. H. Okay.
[11:26.86]Oh my god, this thing reloads so fast now.
[11:29.30]That's ridiculous.
[11:34.14]This lock and load.
[11:35.82]I need to get speed on this thing now.
[11:38.08]I'm gonna go crit boost, because I can just sit next to a dispenser, hopefully.
[11:44.05]Hey, does the animation look like wicked stupid stealth already?
[11:46.57]Come here.
[11:47.79]Like, oh hey, I gotta, like, reload.
[11:48.77]It looks like you're just, like, massaging it.
[11:53.91]It just looks ridiculous.
[11:54.76]Oh, don't worry, reload.
[12:00.62]I'm ready!
[12:02.63]I haven't upgraded the sticky launcher really at all, I need to.
[12:08.51]I need to at least reload speed or shot speed or something.
[12:10.21]Oh, we got demoed Super Demoman again in Pyros?
[12:13.03]Oh, we got Super Demo.
[12:16.49]Oh, we got Super Demo.
[12:19.75]Oh my god, you're shooting that so fast.
[12:27.75]Oh, nice.
[12:32.16]Wow.
[12:32.62]Oh my gosh.
[12:33.60]500 damage on that.
[12:35.14]Oh, run away.
[12:36.18]Give everyone a Buff Banner if you want to get close.
[12:45.83]Come on, Sentry.
[12:46.79]You got more bullets than this.
[12:51.69]At this stage, you better just let the Sentry shoot by itself.
[12:57.11]Ugh.
[12:59.77]Oh god, a Demoman.
[13:00.85]Is he turning left or right?
[13:03.19]Is he turning left or right?
[13:05.01]It's turning right.
[13:06.51]They're both turning right.
[13:08.58]No, I crushed it!
[13:12.50]Oh, I don't get any rage shooting this thing.
[13:17.16]What hit him?
[13:18.48]Spy?
[13:19.60]Oh my god.
[13:22.58]I can only shoot with my level one.
[13:23.94]The amount of damage that is being produced right now.
[13:26.82]I gotta get a trap going over here.
[13:29.61]I'm going to try and super shoot it.
[13:33.11]Got it with the sentry.
[13:34.89]What?
[13:35.19]Give me all eight.
[13:36.69]Go ahead and walk over that, buddy.
[13:38.27]You're going to be toast.
[13:39.11]Okay, I got a lot of it down.
[13:40.29]I got a lot of it down.
[13:40.95]It's going to die.
[13:43.69]Did we get all the money?
[13:45.15]Nope.
[13:45.71]We did?
[13:46.07]Yay!
[13:47.17]We have a great credit rating.
[13:51.50]Yeah, we have a wonderful credit rating.
[13:52.98]I'm probably going to be able to buy two for it.
[13:57.92]thousand credit oh my gosh I think for 100k spoilers if anyone's watching this gonna be giving away all my unusuals geez this is insane that's the fastest I've ever seen anything shoot oh my word let's go with
[14:19.44]We won't be able to play normal TF2 after this.
[14:22.22]I'm going to go with crit resistance.
[14:23.16]I know, this is so much fun.
[14:25.05]We just want to have rapid fire Huntsman and Lock and Load.
[14:29.71]I love this Huntsman just flattering instantly.
[14:32.67]We're gonna play Demoman in regular TF2.
[14:34.69]We're gonna shoot two lock and load shots.
[14:36.29]We're gonna reload so slow.
[14:37.95]You're gonna hate it.
[14:40.18]It's like using cheats.
[14:43.28]It's like using cheats.
[14:44.34]We're gonna become so used to this, it's gonna become more like a... You're gonna want to play this, because like you said, you're gonna play Demoman and just like...
[14:53.38]Jerma, ready up?
[14:54.88]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[14:55.64]I was too busy thinking of how fun this game was.
[14:58.48]Do you guys see just like random like canteens and hats floating around?
[15:03.75]Yes.
[15:04.05]Okay.
[15:05.41]Yeah, I do sometimes.
[15:07.59]Sweet.
[15:10.59]So if you upgrade the Wrangler, does it, what would change?
[15:14.25]Nothing?
[15:14.63]Yeah, I'd say like nothing could change.
[15:17.43]It's kind of sad.
[15:18.55]Take damage that you can't take from on the hill.
[15:21.16]Maybe stronger shielding or something.
[15:23.50]Maybe less time between putting it away and the sentry coming back online by itself.
[15:29.66]Oh, so much spam coming up here.
[15:36.82]There comes the bomb guy.
[15:37.82]Okay, he's good, he's good.
[15:39.30]Oh, my Jesus Christ.
[15:41.36]Watch out, super heavy.
[15:44.80]I got the medics.
[15:46.78]He's dead.
[15:49.25]Do-doom, do-doom, do-doom, do-doom.
[15:50.99]Got him, coach.
[15:52.37]Out of ammo.
[15:53.13]Oh, I hate these guys.
[15:54.35]They just shoot so many.
[15:56.61]Spray those projectiles.
[15:58.81]Here we go.
[15:59.35]Here come the, here come the grenades.
[16:02.16]Alright, hold on.
[16:02.84]Buff pattern roll.
[16:05.28]Watch out, watch out.
[16:05.82]Pick up your sentry.
[16:07.20]I got it.
[16:07.72]I got the sentry.
[16:11.66]I got the sentry.
[16:12.62]It exploded.
[16:15.14]I went through the teleporter and it exploded.
[16:17.93]The teleporter exploded?
[16:20.21]I went through and I just blew up.
[16:21.57]Aw, I died.
[16:22.99]He has five medics on him.
[16:25.71]Oh, wow.
[16:28.32]Oh, that's... Oh, god, I was gonna do so much damage.
[16:31.48]It takes so much damage.
[16:33.50]Oh, man.
[16:34.36]This is bad.
[16:36.46]Oh, come on, medics.
[16:38.00]Oh, he got me.
