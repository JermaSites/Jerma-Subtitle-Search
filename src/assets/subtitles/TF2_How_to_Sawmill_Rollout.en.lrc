[00:17.28]You did a cardinal sin of sawmill.
[00:19.68]I'm gonna show you how to do the good jump on this map.
[00:22.30]I'm gonna teach you guys right now, because you guys want more frickin' tutorial videos.
[00:25.98]We're gonna smack Zanka-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu until we can get enough speed over here, because the game's not letting us go yet.
[00:31.30]Let's keep smacking Marshmallow Mac Daddy, because we need some speed.
[00:34.46]No one came out top.
[00:35.32]You need the whip bonus here.
[00:39.24]Agent 47!
[00:40.50]Agent 47, everybody.
[00:42.12]He doesn't even... And I messed up.
[00:44.68]We're supposed to be working together.
[00:48.18]Teaching everyone how to rocket jump it.
[00:52.60]It's not working.
[00:59.51]This is try number two, because this is the start of the round.
[01:02.23]So we're going to whip Zankatutututu.
[01:04.65]He's my buddy in the whipping strat here.
[01:06.97]You've got to use the whipping strat for this rollout on sawmill.
[01:10.51]King of the Hill sawmill.
[01:11.17]You've got to know your rollouts.
[01:12.97]FPS Doug, also quite helpful.
[01:15.17]Quack of the duck sawmill.
[01:17.72]And I hit the skybox.
[01:20.48]How do you hit the skybox?
[01:22.88]Um, I don't know.
[01:23.84]Mini-Sentries.
[01:24.82]MINISEN- I would like to- Still breaking your desk.
[01:30.28]I would like to say that Windows help and support came up on my screen right now because of how hard I hit my keyboard.
[01:48.59]He has no idea.
[01:49.55]This guy has no idea.
[01:51.73]I want you to get this.
[01:55.07]I want you to get this bad.
[01:56.39]I want you to get this.
[02:01.33]He had an idea eventually.
[02:03.34]What happened?
[02:03.92]He killed you?
[02:04.38]He had an idea, Jerva.
[02:07.32]Hurry, get the health quick.
[02:17.14]I was just standing there waiting for the whip.
[02:22.62]Wow.
[02:24.12]That came out of literally nowhere.
[02:26.46]I didn't see it.
[02:28.04]You're standing there like, oh, where's my whip?
[02:30.24]Crit rocket across the whole friggin' map.
[02:38.95]No!
[02:39.83]I didn't have it out.
[02:40.67]I would have had him.
[02:41.37]Who could predict a thing like that?
[02:44.60]And he's just walking forward!
[02:46.42]He doesn't even know!
[02:47.38]He doesn't even know!
[02:49.42]Backstab, backstab!
[02:50.62]Backstab!
[02:51.30]Look out!
[02:52.34]Still disguised as a Pyro.
[02:54.14]And this Pyro is chasing me.
[02:58.90]I'm over on the right-hand side.
[03:00.92]Don't even talk to me.
[03:02.86]I'm not in the zone, Jerma.
[03:04.88]You see, to get in the zone, there are several precautions that need to be taken.
[03:11.13]I would have to send a letter of recommendation to the mayor before I can go in the zone.
[03:18.29]I'm the pyro underneath.
[03:19.77]Underneath what?
[03:20.90]I'm your friendly pyro.
[03:22.82]Is that you?
[03:23.62]I'm your friend.
[03:24.22]Yeah, what are you doing?
[03:25.12]I had to check.
[03:26.20]If it went through you, you weren't a spy.
[03:27.90]I told you I was the friendly pyro sitting underneath you.
[03:31.72]I had to check.
[03:39.14]This skybox is going to be the death of me.
[03:50.31]Oh, come on.
[03:50.85]Why wouldn't there be a sentry at their spawn?
[03:53.25]Tell me.
[03:54.27]It's going to be there.
[03:55.75]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[03:57.09]I actually got a clip of killing someone doing this like a month ago.
[04:00.75]I didn't really need to do any of this, I guess.
[04:06.54]Yay, got a guy.
[04:10.33]I am above you.
[04:11.43]It's secret.
[04:11.93]I got hit by a mini.
[04:13.19]I gotta get this health pack, but you need to cover me.
[04:16.17]There's nobody here.
[04:16.85]Okay, there's Demoknight coming behind.
[04:18.70]Demoknight coming behind.
[04:19.48]He's right here.
[04:22.26]He doesn't care!
[04:23.18]What?
[04:24.90]He was looking right at you, too.
[04:26.26]I'm in super secret.
[04:27.68]I'm naming this super secret.
[04:30.76]Alright, well, I'm taking the health pack.
[04:33.70]Oh my god, him swimming with that katana up is like a shark.
