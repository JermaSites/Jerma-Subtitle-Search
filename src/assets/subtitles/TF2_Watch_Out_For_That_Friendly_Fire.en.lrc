[02:42.61]The crits are down.
[02:43.31]No!
[02:45.63]What's gonna happen here is somebody's gonna detonate it first when I say three, and every single person in the room is gonna explode, and the crit server's gonna crash.
[02:53.75]Yeah.
[02:55.10]I'm looking forward to that.
[02:57.12]Alright, that's it.

[02:58.49]Alright, alright, alright.
[02:59.33]So everybody get in here.

[03:18.22]Are you ready?
[03:19.46]One, two, three.
[03:27.37]There's nobody.
[03:28.63]Nobody lived through that.
[03:29.61]There was one guy left there.
[03:30.88]I don't even know what happened.
[03:32.20]I don't even know what happened.
[03:33.62]The game, like, couldn't handle that.
[03:35.06]It just didn't understand.
[03:38.98]Three, two, one.
[03:40.96]Oh.
[03:48.19]It's... Alright.
[03:50.29]This is too... This is too much.
[03:56.04]What?
[03:56.88]Why are these- Oh, he keeps on getting healed.
[04:00.40]We're going heavy.
[04:01.52]Everybody's a threat.
[04:02.32]I don't even care.
[04:02.90]I don't even care.
[04:07.16]If I see person, I'm shooting person.
[04:10.16]I think I just killed my own spy.
[04:17.61]See, like, trying to heal yourself with a power jack is not- it doesn't work.
[04:25.70]I love the chat.
[04:26.70]This is dumb.
[04:32.01]Somebody has to try to win the game, but everybody's... The second I say that, of course, like, somebody just puts a shotgun in somebody's face.
[04:47.18]Look at these two going at it.
[04:53.87]Get him!
[04:54.69]Get him!
[04:55.41]Oh, there's a caper!
[04:58.29]Did you do that?
[04:58.83]You capped it.
[05:00.37]Somebody capped it.
[05:01.99]I know, I need to heal.
[05:04.49]I need to heal!
[05:05.09]He just tried to kill you.
[05:08.19]The sniper is this... Oh, you're so dead.
[05:10.53]No!
[05:10.65]See, the sniper's... See, right now, this guy is gonna shoot the first person.
[05:14.27]Oh, he doesn't realize.
[05:14.98]He doesn't realize the Huntsman doesn't hit teammates.
[05:18.64]And this is the flamethrower.
[05:21.24]GG.
[05:21.44]GG.
[05:25.29]I'm taking off the Tommy slob, I'm just going Brass Beast.
[05:30.81]You can't light me on fire, it doesn't work!
[05:34.63]Exit.
[05:35.61]That was my exit strategy.
[05:38.69]Make sure no one's, like, following me.
[05:41.75]All you son of a bitches are a threat.
[05:46.87]Oh, no, no!
[05:47.53]Where am I getting shot from?
[05:50.02]You were on the point.
[05:51.39]I was like, where is everybody?
[05:52.63]I'm walking outside.
[05:53.49]It's like three red soldiers trying to kill each other.
[05:56.13]No!
[05:56.47]I gotta shoot him in the head.
[05:59.82]Yes!
[06:01.14]I'm getting told off by the AFK manager for not moving from spawn.
[06:04.60]I can't get out of my spawn.
[06:05.68]Why can I not hit this guy?
[06:06.79]What the hell was going on?
[06:14.57]Seriously, it's like if you don't move from spawn soon, you'll be moved to spectre.
[06:18.17]I can't physically get out!
[06:22.89]You're gonna get booted from the server because you can't move.
[06:26.15]That's bullshit.
[06:29.14]Oh Pyro is the worst class to play in this.
[06:31.24]Honestly, I don't even know why I'm disguising.
[06:33.10]There's no point in disguising.
[06:34.98]Oh, yeah, dude.
[06:35.60]Your dead ringer will pop from teammates.
[06:37.50]Mm-hmm.
[06:38.74]It could look kind of convincing actually.
[06:42.52]Good.
[06:43.06]Good.
[06:43.32]We got somebody on the cap.
[06:44.60]What the hell is going on over here?
[06:46.79]Why is this guy's clothing just over here?
[06:48.47]No!
[06:53.43]I'm gonna... No, I still... I got 7 HP.
[06:54.79]I'm good.
[06:56.33]As long as one of my teammates doesn't show up, I'll be okay.
