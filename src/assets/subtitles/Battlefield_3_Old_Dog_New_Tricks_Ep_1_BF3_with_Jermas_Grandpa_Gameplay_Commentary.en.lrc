[00:01.58]I am the Rocket Man they talk about.
[00:04.69]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:10.43]Okay, so I'm in here with Shibby2142.
[00:14.80]He's the best battlefield player in the world.
[00:17.36]And I decided to hire him at a very, very stable rate to teach me how to play this game and what to do.
[00:24.25]So, what's the first thing I need to know?
[00:27.13]Alright, well, first thing you need to know, old man, is that you're on the clock, so let's quit screwing around and get going.
[00:31.99]Okay, well, wait, wait, where you going?
[00:34.91]Uh, over by this, uh, this vehicle?
[00:37.06]There's vehicles in this game that you have to, uh, drive?
[00:39.72]Yes, I know, I suck at this.
[00:41.10]Do you want me to drive?
[00:42.12]You drive!
[00:42.58]Teach me, I need to drive!
[00:44.14]I'll be your chauffeur.
[00:45.48]Whoa, wait a second, what is this?
[00:47.50]Grandpa, you're in the gunner seat of this little Jeep here.
[00:50.71]What if I don't want to do this?
[00:51.93]What if I want to sit here and read a book in the passenger seat?
[00:54.60]Press F3, then.
[00:55.76]You can be my passenger.
[00:57.66]There we go.
[00:58.02]Oh, look at that.
[00:59.06]Hey.
[01:01.38]Hey, Jimmy, what's up?
[01:02.74]Just hanging out here looking out the window at some girls.
[01:05.29]Hey, can we pretend there's girls we're looking at?
[01:08.35]Alright, Grandpa.
[01:09.13]Well, let's go pick up some ladies at Dairy Queen.
[01:11.77]How's that sound?
[01:13.13]I love Dairy Queen.
[01:16.04]That guy must have been hacking, and there's no way he killed you.
[01:18.14]Wait, how do I revive you?
[01:19.74]Uh, Grandpa, you need to be in the medic class.
[01:21.26]I believe you're support.
[01:22.78]Well, that's fucked up.
[01:23.58]I don't want to be that anymore.
[01:24.70]Alright, hold on.
[01:25.54]I'm bringing in air support, Grandpa.
[01:26.96]Just hold steady.
[01:28.90]I'm staying over here to check.
[01:30.60]I'm coming in.
[01:32.47]Oh, there you are.
[01:33.33]I'm coming in, Goose.
[01:34.73]Holy shit, Ryan, that thing like a boss.
[01:37.45]Whoa, whoa!
[01:39.33]Oh, Grandpa!
[01:40.75]It fucking killed me!
[01:43.92]No.
[01:44.16]Grandpa, you're not paying me to team kill you.
[01:46.80]I'm just checking your teeth.
[01:47.64]Alright, just kidding, Grandpa.
[01:48.38]Perfect.
[02:09.31]Yeah, let's get our knives out.
[02:12.89]We could do some fishing.
[02:14.45]Or you could fish with explosives.
[02:17.53]So if you want to throw your grenade, we can see if we got any fish.
[02:19.63]Oh, that's perfect, Grandpa.
[02:21.82]We're not fishing for... No, this is wrong.
[02:24.14]Grandpa.
[02:24.40]Grandpa.
[02:32.39]You're drowning yourself.
[02:34.00]This isn't right.
[02:35.40]This is dumb.
[02:36.70]Bullshit.
[02:38.00]Whoa, this is difficult.
[02:40.16]Gramp, are you drunk right now?
[02:42.06]I've been drunk for the last three days.
[02:44.58]I'm a little jealous, sir.
[02:46.66]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:47.24]Why did we just jump out of there?
[02:49.08]You put it in the water.
[02:50.86]What, you can't drive in water?
[02:52.18]What is this, a dumb fucking game?
[02:52.96]Yeah, if the vehicles touch water, it's bad.
[02:56.23]Alright, so you go, and I'll wait.
[02:59.89]Are you dead?
[03:01.09]Yes.
[03:02.81]I'm trying to revive you, but I think you're too old.
[03:05.29]I'm trying to revive you, but you're too old, Grandpa.
[03:08.58]What am I paying you for anyway?
[03:11.48]Well, considering you owe me about $6,000, we'll just call it that.
[03:17.38]What do you mean I owe you $6,000?
[03:21.04]What, you don't remember if you died?
[03:22.44]You owe me $6,000.
[03:24.44]That was bullshit!
[03:26.90]I don't think so.
[03:27.56]That was a fucking joke.
[03:29.16]Can't take a joke, Mr. 2142.
[03:32.46]Battlefield's a pretty serious soldier.
[03:34.58]So how much do I owe you?
[03:36.96]I'm thinking, uh, let's call it $7,500.
[03:39.81]Well, get the fuck out of here.
[03:41.19]That's ridiculous.
[03:43.17]Grandpa, you just shot me.
[03:45.07]Yeah, well, you deserved it.
[03:46.13]I'm not paying you that kind of money.
[03:47.17]I was going to give you, like, $10.
