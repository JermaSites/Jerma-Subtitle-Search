[00:42.53]Oh, look at how much fun we're having on the school bus.
[00:47.59]We need to go on the ramp before we all jump out, though.

[01:34.51]Somebody... I'm over the edge.
[01:36.01]Somebody just kill me.
[01:37.93]I can't like... I was pressing F and it would not let me jump.
[01:44.25]What a bunch of like a bunch of weirdos man, we're just criminals just all in a bus just like oh

[02:05.14]Oh, here we go!
[02:06.14]Oh, Dremel's dead!
[02:07.00]Oh, wait, no, I thought he was about to, like, walk out of the car.

[02:12.12]And you present, you just get up.
[02:14.34]Oh, my gosh.
[02:15.35]Look!
[02:15.93]What is in front of us?
[02:17.13]What's going on down the street?
[02:19.61]What the hell was that?
[02:22.57]Are they, like, time-bombing the server?
[02:25.81]They were trying to, like, time-bomb us and blow up the bridge.
[02:27.89]They didn't want to, like, serve.
[02:29.25]Oh, there's a helicopter above us.
[02:31.53]There we go.
[02:34.20]Oh!
[02:35.42]Oh!
[02:36.04]Goodness gracious.
[02:37.64]We're under fire!
[02:39.40]We're going so fast!
[02:41.08]Look at that cop car just roll over!
[02:43.28]Hey, the funniest part about this... If we light on fire, we're never gonna get out in time.
[02:47.73]We're gonna, like, nonchalantly walk through the door.
[02:49.91]Oh, if the thing's on fire, might as well, like, walk, like, very slowly.
[02:56.51]Oh, that stops us more than I thought it would.
[03:03.51]Alright, we've made it to the airport.
[03:06.49]Hooray.
[03:07.00]Ow.
[03:07.54]You get out of here, car!
[03:12.84]Why is this green car following us?
[03:14.94]The green car, you want some pictures?
[03:17.04]Looks like an undercover cop.
[03:18.42]Oh, no!
[03:18.78]Get out of the bus!
[03:21.66]Get out of the bus!
[03:22.50]Get out of the bus!

[03:33.81]I will see you soon.
[03:42.43]We made it so far.
[03:45.75]We came up just a little short.
[03:47.77]Boo, what are we doing?
[03:50.65]We gotta survive, we gotta get to the choppers.
[03:53.03]I just wanted to take it off the ramp, that's all I wanted.
[04:13.25]Imagine if you were on a bus, and it was on fire, and everyone just like, one at a time, just gets on the bus.
[04:21.09]Dude, I would be pushing people out of the car.
[04:23.79]Like, punching people to get out of there.
[04:25.83]Let's make our head away.
[04:28.49]Oh, man, my head.
[04:31.07]Oh, hey, Talon.
[04:34.01]We'll leave shades by everything.
[04:38.10]What is with the telecopters?
[04:39.60]Me and Bill are still being chased.
[04:41.40]Does somebody want to get in and do crazy flips with me?
[04:43.89]No, there's two!
[04:44.47]There's two copters!
[04:45.61]Oh my god!
[04:49.05]There's two guys!
[04:50.17]What is this guy doing?
[04:53.38]I'll tell you where we're going, Bill.
[04:54.88]There's three helicopters behind us, and they're...
[04:59.03]Jeremy just got ran over by a cop.
[05:01.07]No, you don't understand.
[05:02.94]Those three choppers are running into each other.
[05:06.50]Blading each other over and over again.
[05:08.24]Oh, the helicopter's... Oh, that one's going down.
[05:10.76]Oh, my God.
[05:11.44]Whoa, I just saw him.
[05:12.73]They're crashing into each other.
[05:14.19]Uh-oh.
[05:15.57]I don't think we're going to get into the telecom this time.
[05:17.85]Oh, no.
[05:18.59]I just made... Oh, no.
[05:21.67]Awww.
[05:24.91]Dude, how dangerous do we have to be?
[05:28.13]Where the pilots don't even communicate.
[05:30.99]They're just like driving into each other.
[05:33.40]Do whatever.
[05:34.16]Quick.
[05:35.86]Wait a minute.
[05:36.54]Oh jeez.
[05:40.02]He's just leaving this girl that he like had with him.
[05:42.82]Fuck off.
[05:45.49]I gotta get over there.
[05:46.33]Oh, come on.
[05:48.21]I gotta get over there.
[05:52.31]I have to get over there.
