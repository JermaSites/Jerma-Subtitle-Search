[00:59.43]What a nice violin.
[01:01.57]Do you hear the violin?
[01:02.59]Or the oboe?
[01:07.03]Whatever instrument this is.
[01:19.86]Clarinet.
[01:21.42]Might be a clarinet.
[01:26.54]Yeah, I haven't been around streaming the last couple days.
[01:30.20]Because I've been trying to finish this video.
[01:35.99]But I didn't finish it.
[01:37.19]It's not done.
[01:37.79]So let's just try to beat Dark Souls 3.
[01:39.63]Here we go.
[01:51.80]I see a wizard just subscribed for five months in a row.
[01:57.72]Damn.
[01:58.78]Thanks, man.
[02:05.78]Didn't you stream yesterday?
[02:06.78]No, I didn't.
[02:09.84]I did not stream yesterday.
[02:13.80]Does this guy even have a YouTube channel?
[02:16.71]Hey, it's not the longest I've ever gone without uploading.
[02:19.25]It took me like three and a half weeks to make that top five video that I put off since like January 8th.
[02:32.98]Alright, so where I left... There was a couple things I wanted to do.
[02:37.69]I wanted to... Just go back to where I left off.
[02:47.56]This is... I killed this boss.
[02:49.30]This is the last thing I did.
[02:50.38]A couple days ago.
[02:53.64]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[02:57.86]Hey, Fortress Final Queue.
[03:01.41]Thanks for subbing.
[03:10.90]Fortress Final Q. This is where I left off five minutes before.
[03:19.75]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[03:24.47]I'm Mr. Pinky.
[03:26.85]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[03:30.18]So... Hey, thanks for the tip, random phantom.
[03:37.32]Can I do that?
[03:39.32]Okay.
[03:39.88]Well, it's a good thing I saw that random guy do that.
[03:43.07]Because I probably would have walked around in circles for an hour.
[03:52.01]I have so much health.
[03:52.79]I dumped a bunch of points into vitality.
[03:54.35]Whoa.
[03:57.63]Creepy.
[04:04.29]Third man, I missed a few of your streams.
[04:06.31]Haven't been able to share a resub.
[04:07.45]Well, thanks regardless, dude.
[04:19.55]I think we're getting close to the end of the game.
[04:27.06]I would take a guess.
[04:32.86]And I have an Ember on as well.
[04:39.18]I don't mess around in these games, man.
[04:42.11]I'm talking about HP.
[04:43.45]When things can kill you so easily, I dump points into Vitality.
[04:47.39]I'm going up.
[04:55.80]Star is playing the worst possible... What's the worst possible character?
[05:01.73]Is there like a worst possible character?
[05:03.45]What is it?
[05:03.83]Hold on a second.
[05:07.63]I can go left trunk stabbing in the back.
[05:16.62]Let me get my bearings over here for a second and just take a peek.
[05:23.78]Okay.
[05:26.46]So I just climb up here.
[05:30.75]Sometimes you have to ground yourself when you get up to a new area.
[05:33.91]That's what I did.
[05:34.67]The ground is made out of metal.
[05:35.89]I had to make sure I ground myself.
[05:37.94]Alright, so left, straight, right.
[05:41.06]I guess I'm going to go left first.
[05:44.88]I want to remember.
[05:45.80]Keep in mind, I've got to remember that.
[05:46.78]This is another way to go.
[05:51.48]I also haven't played in a couple days, so I'm going to have to warm up a little bit here.
[05:54.29]Alright.
[06:01.47]I think this is an area we were at before.
[06:05.33]He's just doing daggers?
[06:06.63]You would think that would be good, wouldn't it?
[06:09.37]Okay, well, you made that easy for me.
[06:21.15]Oh no, he's lightning enchanting his sword.
[06:29.48]I'm trying to get that to work.
[06:30.60]I don't know what the timing on it is, though.
[06:37.44]Ah, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[06:44.03]Hey, Sebex!
[06:44.33]Sebex with the reset.
[06:45.81]He's a moderator.
[06:46.65]I know him.
[06:47.05]He's a moderator.
[06:47.93]Oh boy, I'm like looking at stuff.
[06:49.09]Oh, you think you're gonna heal, don't you?
[06:58.09]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[07:03.25]LOL bears.
[07:05.72]Thanks Stu.
[07:11.12]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[07:15.63]Kinger 2005.
[07:16.15]I almost said 2015.
[07:21.46]That's a bunch of mwah-hahs in a row.
[07:23.20]Mwah-hah.
[07:24.61]Okay.
[07:25.73]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[07:29.19]Tinkle surprise.
[07:31.31]Two months.
[07:34.17]There was a place I could jump over there, wasn't there?
[07:35.81]Listen to me, son.
[07:38.49]I'm your dad.
[07:40.94]Destroy him!
[07:44.38]Whoa!
[07:46.20]Zan Davis.
[07:48.22]Thanks a lot, dude.
[07:48.94]Welcome.
[07:49.88]Why am I toxic?
[07:53.09]I want to jump over here and take a look.
[07:57.75]Zan Davis.
[08:00.05]Consumed King's Garden.
[08:03.47]Alright, let's go beat the king.
[08:05.84]Let's go kill King Joestashard.
[08:08.42]Let's go take out the king.
[08:13.94]King Joffrey.
[08:17.04]King Robert Baratheon.
[08:24.75]That's the only way I can go.
[08:27.87]King Jon Snow.
[08:30.91]King Eddard Stark.
[08:37.06]Okay.
[08:37.58]Well, Toxic really just makes me angry.
[08:44.08]It seriously just makes me angry.
[08:47.44]So I'm just gonna... Oh, I have two Titanite chunks.
[08:50.00]You know what that means.
[08:50.64]I can upgrade the katana.
[08:54.89]Good thing we're in toxic land.
[08:59.35]One of these guys.
[09:00.21]Let me look back here.
[09:09.95]This just looks like where I was.
[09:11.77]I have no idea.
[09:22.74]All I know is that I'm going to forever take damage.
[09:25.42]Just want to let you know that this stream has been an absolute highlight of my night.
[09:33.67]I'm an indie game dev and we're in crunch mode.
[09:36.99]Well, what... What are you making?
[09:43.71]I'm glad I can be your background noise.
[09:50.27]While you work on your game.
[09:52.80]So that was just a wraparound to here.
[09:54.86]I don't see how... So what's the point of me jumping off there to get the Estus Shard?
[10:00.16]I guess.
[10:01.64]Whatever.
[10:08.55]Unless there's something else I could do.
[10:09.67]Which I don't think there was.
[10:11.63]Because that just keeps going down.
[10:12.99]Is there another secret door?
[10:17.80]Nah.
[10:24.66]Mr. Kool-Aid.
[10:30.48]Thanks a lot, dude.
[10:33.02]I'm actually going to go back because I know I have enough souls for an upgrade.
[10:38.74]So this was a good little peek of what's here.
[10:43.20]Good peek.
[10:47.77]I do have to drop down.
[10:51.58]Puzzles of power.
[10:55.07]Good luck to you, man.
[11:01.29]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[11:05.84]Christopher.
[11:07.28]Thank you.
[11:08.38]Thank you, Christopher.
[11:10.56]Oh, thanks, Chris.
[11:11.16]Welcome back.
[11:13.04]Alright.
[11:13.54]We're going to go back home.
[11:15.14]Back to bed, as we say.
[11:19.64]In the pee drinker chat.
[11:23.06]Because I want to level up before I lose these.
[11:24.94]Because I'm going to die out here.
[11:30.12]Don't tell Jerma how to say my name.
[11:31.68]It's Kool-Aid.
[11:33.56]Is it like Q-Lade?
[11:34.22]Q-Lade?
[11:34.55]Mr. Q-Lade?
[11:48.63]To the death count, not just my age.
[11:59.82]I love that.
[12:02.38]Yeah, I'm doing Paula Deen again.
[12:04.16]Listen to me, son.
[12:12.06]I need a Paula Deen sub song.
[12:13.08]I'm your dad.
[12:15.46]Destroy him!
[12:20.88]Legend Mane.
[12:23.94]That's Legend Man, right?
[12:28.69]Welcome.
[12:29.07]Thanks, dude.
[12:35.15]And Courtesy Flush.
[12:37.95]Some of you guys have real fucking weird Twitch names.
[12:41.12]Oh, God.
[12:42.00]Oh, God.
[12:50.49]And the jaunty juggernaut.
[12:53.55]The juggernaut.
[12:55.59]Thanks to the threes.
[12:57.85]The back-to-back-to-back home runs.
[13:04.80]I can do that.
[13:05.46]I can give you my shard as well.
[13:12.82]You want to see my shard, dude?
[13:19.25]There's the shard.
[13:23.67]I need 682.
[13:24.11]I could probably sell some stuff.
[13:29.97]Courtesy plush.
[13:31.97]This one's a thousand.
[13:47.52]A thousand for this.
[13:51.60]Why is this one so much more expensive?
[14:01.29]Whatever.
[14:01.57]Hopefully that wasn't a mistake.
[14:08.01]Let's get this thing to plus seven.
[14:15.81]Oh, this thing is... I can't wait to just do some chopping.
[14:24.76]Oh yeah, doesn't Overwatch have a beta right now?
[14:27.04]Like a big open beta?
[14:33.75]I'm pretty sure there is a huge open beta right now.
[14:43.59]I need like a Paula Deen laughing subsound.
[14:45.90]Her just being like... Oh, it's lovely!
[14:49.66]Yeah, that's going to replace Paul Bearer.
[14:52.28]Probably like the next stream.
[14:55.08]Although, we'll see.
[14:55.98]I might not be able to handle that for longer than like an hour.
[14:58.79]Because Paul Bearer is fun.
[15:00.81]Because Paul Bearer like tells me to do things.
[15:03.86]And it makes sense for playing a game.
[15:06.30]Especially like Dark Souls or something.
[15:07.74]Paula Deen just laughing.
[15:10.32]Might not be the greatest thing to do.
[15:12.64]Did he actually give him the tip of that?
[15:20.84]I'll try to... I'll try to get you.
[15:34.70]Whoa, wait a second.
[15:35.88]What the?
[15:37.17]Why couldn't I?
[15:37.73]Did I not have any stamina?
[15:39.67]I guess I just didn't have any stamina.
[15:41.07]That was really confusing.
[15:42.03]He's giving me a lot more trouble than he was last time.
[15:48.49]Oh boy.
[16:06.76]I thought that was going to kill him.
[16:13.54]It's so funny.
[16:14.58]You want to know what the biggest mistake I did?
[16:17.27]Is not playing this game for the two days in a row that I didn't play it.
[16:22.45]I feel like Dark Souls is like a MOBA.
[16:24.89]If you stop playing it for even a couple days, you can't play the game ever again.
[16:44.12]I take one, like, two-day break and I can't play this game again.
[16:50.19]Wonderful.
[17:01.07]I'm gonna swing your little guy, your, like, American flag shield.
[17:04.59]Okay, I'm, like, just being a dickhead right now.
[17:18.18]Alright, I gotta like shake out the bugs.
[17:21.26]Cause seriously, that was fucking terrible.
[17:29.28]I gotta remember how to play Dark Souls.
[17:36.73]I'm doing good Falkanth, how are you?
[17:37.91]Listen to me son!
[17:42.19]I'm your dad!
[17:44.63]DESTROY HIM!
[17:51.00]Kusti.
[17:52.52]Or Kusti.
[17:53.58]Kusti.
[17:56.18]Whoever you are, whatever your name is.
[17:57.64]Thanks, what's up?
[17:59.18]Welcome.
[18:05.44]Welcome to the family.
[18:14.41]Whoa, out of stamina.
[18:22.48]And These guys are so much louder than every enemy.
[18:30.45]Do you notice that?
[18:34.25]Bill ear Life talks welcome.
[18:38.21]Thanks, dude.
[18:39.47]Welcome back that is Come on do something
[18:53.96]You did something.
[18:55.00]You did something.
[18:56.70]Can we not fight on the stairs?
[18:57.86]This is a really stupid place.
[18:59.42]Both of us should be in agreeance on that.
[19:00.84]Come on, shove me.
[19:12.57]I know you want to.
[19:14.41]I know you want to.
[19:19.19]Do it.
[19:20.39]Ah!
[19:27.33]Both hit each other Mmm spin around spin around Toxic is so annoying.
[19:42.34]Oh my god Just by dancing around this guy I'm dying Listen to me son!
[20:04.60]AJ 117 or one thousand one seven or one zero zero one seven.
[20:14.86]Welcome to thanks.
[20:20.42]Well, that's a lot of stuff in here.
[20:21.68]Claw.
[20:31.10]Seems to be... ...lots of stuff.
[20:34.42]The Shadow Leggings.
[20:35.52]Where's Shadow...?
[20:36.74]Shadow Gear was really good in Dark Souls 2, if I remember.
[20:38.85]I don't know if that's exactly what it was.
[20:42.23]I didn't really get a good glimpse.
[20:45.83]But... Those things are so horrible.
[20:51.46]I'm gonna grab this item and we're gonna take a left.
[20:56.26]Human Resin.
[21:00.59]Get me above ground.
[21:02.26]Another Titanite chunk.
[21:05.98]Good thing the chunks are just everywhere here.
[21:09.64]Shit.
[21:14.42]I'm almost dead from the toxic.
[21:19.98]I mean this might just be like an item collection run right now.
[21:22.88]Dark gem.
[21:31.56]Hey, storm flare!
[21:33.98]Storm flare!
[21:35.08]Back again.
[21:35.62]This toxic is going to kill me.
[21:43.46]I don't have any way around this.
[21:44.48]Maybe it'll run out by the time... By the time I die, hopefully it runs out.
[21:49.89]I don't know.
[21:52.49]At least I'm getting the items.
[21:53.39]I can just kind of run through this after.
[21:55.43]Now that I know it's this small area.
[22:01.07]Alright, I'm gonna die.
[22:02.93]It's time to do this tried and true technique because I know I'm dead so just run.
[22:07.96]Nevermind.
[22:11.92]Nevermind.
[22:21.59]This is like the third swamp toxic area in the game.
[22:27.54]Like I said, get me in the sky.
[22:28.94]Can we go, like, underground?
[22:30.06]Can we go, like, into a mining facility or something?
[22:36.14]Do we seriously have to be toxic, life drain?
[22:39.27]It's, like, three areas of this game.
[22:45.31]I'm not gonna fight this guy.
[22:47.07]Too awkward of a place to fight you.
[22:48.87]It's, like, too many places.
[22:50.57]Oh, shit.
[22:52.51]Well, I forgot to send it back up, so now we have to fight.
[23:00.34]Maybe not.
[23:03.60]Maybe I can just bait him out.
[23:07.51]And maybe he'll just fall down to his death.
[23:12.93]Whoa, he's going the other way.
[23:13.87]Alright, see you later.
[23:24.30]I feel like he's on top of the teepee here.
[23:32.72]I'm gonna send it right back up.
[23:33.76]And I'm just gonna run through.
[23:34.56]This toxic is not cool.
[23:37.50]I got a lot of the items.
[23:38.64]I don't have to fight this thing.
[23:39.92]I already killed it.
[23:41.12]And it's apparently still gonna hit me.
[23:46.56]Maybe I can not get toxic if I get up here quick.
[23:49.22]Okay.
[23:53.96]I'm not toxic yet.
[23:57.30]Don't really want to aggro this guy, though.
[23:59.21]I'm gonna wait.
[23:59.89]I'm gonna go up the left stairs.
[24:06.43]3... 2... 1... Action!
[24:16.30]Alright.
[24:17.02]Not toxic.
[24:22.30]Finally.
[24:23.70]I cannot be terrified of every single turn.
[24:26.46]These guys do drop Titanite chunks, so it's probably worth just killing them once at least.
[24:36.55]These guys don't have a shield.
[24:37.69]Oh, good!
[24:46.51]Oh, shit.
[24:48.73]Oh, no.
[24:49.15]I'm locked in a corner.
[24:50.95]Stuck in the fucking corner.
[24:54.69]I couldn't move.
[24:55.75]Oh, god.
[25:00.65]You tell me I can't like squeeze through that guy?
[25:03.19]It was his body and then the corner, and that was it.
[25:06.31]That's it, you're dead.
[25:17.36]I fucking hate that shit.
[25:20.10]If it's not a tree, it's a wedge.
[25:22.32]If it's not a wedge, it's a guy's body.
[25:25.31]And you have to fight these guys.
[25:26.67]These huge guys, by the way.
[25:29.20]These gigantic fucking knights, you have to fight them in tiny little playground areas.
[25:41.82]These guys are too big for this place.
[25:44.16]You guys are too big to ride the ride, sorry.
[25:51.46]Sorry, like, adults aren't allowed in the ball pit.
[25:54.30]Can you get the fuck out of here?
[26:11.95]I have to, like, bring every person to over here.
[26:20.06]Who's ringing a bell?
[26:22.84]What the hell is that?
[26:25.72]What is that guy doing?
[26:28.30]I don't know what that guy's doing.
[26:35.72]I don't want to fight up there.
[26:36.84]I really don't.
[26:38.38]I'm just going by you.
[26:40.93]I can't.
[26:41.67]Okay, well is this toxic?
[26:43.15]It's not.
[26:49.44]Oh wow, he swung all the way around.
[26:50.78]Oh my god, these guys are fucking... They just swing at 360 degrees!
[26:57.20]I'm trying!
[26:57.72]I'm trying, Sausage!
[27:09.51]Your name is crazy.
[27:15.28]Sausage wagon.
[27:21.80]What are you doing?
[27:26.33]You paid money to have that name show up.
[27:31.23]Does your mother know you have that name?
[27:32.89]And I didn't send it up.
[27:37.98]Like die again, I just know I was not prepared for this at all I'm gonna go fight the guy that swings in 360 degrees five times in a row.
[27:59.23]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[28:00.32]Oh
[28:19.72]I'm just going by all these things, and I'm toxic, too.
[28:22.59]God damn it.
[28:24.69]How come I got toxic this time?
[28:26.09]You know what?
[28:35.80]Now that I'm... Because I'm toxic, I'm just gonna have to run.
[28:38.40]I'm running through this entire level to see what's here.
[28:44.89]I can go left, straight, or right.
[28:47.11]Maybe I don't have to go this way.
[28:50.75]Orthocone.
[28:51.41]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[28:53.97]Like, I... I don't even think I have to go this way.
[28:57.22]Like, there's three fucking ways to go.
[28:58.70]This is probably one of the ways you don't have to go.
[29:00.50]Ah, they just spin around.
[29:08.20]Is this dark?
[29:09.00]There's a boss right here.
[29:12.08]What is this?
[29:13.82]Are you serious?
[29:18.88]Okay.
[29:25.70]It's 1.15 in the morning in England.
[29:26.68]I'm drunk.
[29:27.16]It's money well spent.
[29:31.36]It's like a dog boss.
[29:34.26]Oh.
[29:42.36]Is this guy talking?
[29:43.50]What?
[29:43.82]Ugh Alright, this dude is cool
[30:12.05]It was worth me going through this stupid area.
[30:14.91]Okay, we're already going.
[30:17.62]Too bad I'm toxic.
[30:18.48]At least I know that I can just come right here, though.
[30:28.01]Where am I?
[30:28.43]I'm stuck in these balls.
[30:43.16]Let me just see what he does.
[30:45.52]He does big swings.
[30:48.23]Big tail swipe.
[30:53.93]Is he like a baby crying too?
[30:57.89]What can I do?
[30:59.15]Is he holding a kid?
[31:00.31]No.
[31:00.41]I'm going to say that's really strange if he is.
[31:03.54]Wrong button.
[31:09.76]So that's Frost I'm going to assume?
[31:15.11]I think.
[31:21.35]Consumed King.
[31:22.40]I don't think you're the- what?
[31:25.48]Why am I getting a cutscene in the middle of the fight?
[31:29.46]What?
[31:29.80]Where is he?
[31:46.75]Should I like I feel like I have to have him attack his like own son or something Why would he why would they do that for no reason?
[31:56.76]This guy's voice is awesome though.
[31:59.22]I like this character a lot Where is this?
[32:02.26]Where's this like the baby?
[32:03.12]Do I have to have him hit the baby?
[32:09.43]Maybe he has to break the stuff around him.
[32:11.47]Let's see what happens.
[32:16.38]Okay, well.
[32:20.76]Good to know.
[32:23.41]Good to know that he's right there.
[32:28.61]Just got to make sure I'm not toxic when I fight him.
[32:38.00]I'm not going to take an Ember.
[32:39.86]Not until I truly have an attempt that I know I'm going to be able to beat.
[32:47.61]Although this run is not going to be good.
[32:52.73]The leather jacket.
[32:57.35]Six months.
[32:57.87]Has it already been another month?
[32:58.89]I feel like you just resubbed like five days ago.
[33:05.60]Does time just travel way faster?
[33:08.10]For some reason?
[33:09.64]But no, thanks man.
[33:10.64]One of the other mods.
[33:18.78]So, if I can just chill here.
[33:21.98]Yeah, this boss run sucks because you have to wait.
[33:24.26]Otherwise you get toxic before you fight him.
[33:26.06]Unless there's a skip somewhere that I wasn't seeing.
[33:27.74]Let's try it.
[33:36.61]No, you're not a good spot!
[33:44.56]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[33:45.88]A lot of shit to avoid on this run back.
[33:49.42]Unless, no, that way, nothing.
[33:53.04]Nothing.
[33:53.88]Let me just make sure that I'm not missing something else.
[33:58.00]I don't think I am.
[34:02.01]Well, shit.
[34:05.59]Let's go fight the dragon, baby.
[34:11.54]Oh, the twitches might be making up for the... Okay.
[34:14.98]Oh, help me.
[34:15.58]Let's try it again.
[34:23.66]Missed out on like 8,000 souls earlier, but whatever.
[34:46.50]Oh shit, that's gonna fuck me up every time.
[35:05.41]Me skipping through that dialog each time.
[35:09.21]It's gonna make me laugh every time.
[35:23.57]Again come on Does that move a lot like it's not that dangerous Whoa
[35:53.19]Whoa, this is new.
[35:53.89]What's going on?
[35:56.13]What's he doing?
[35:56.76]Okay, now he's on all fours.
[36:03.36]Okay, now he's mad.
[36:05.58]He's mad.
[36:08.71]Oh, now he shoots crystal ice.
[36:11.91]Oh my god, you can just kind of go psycho now, don't you?
[36:24.86]He's so much faster than he was before.
[36:33.18]Damn.
[36:36.16]This reminds me of Bloodstarved Beast in Bloodborne, which was just so annoying.
[36:43.86]Ludwig's first phase was just exactly like this.
[36:47.86]Just an erratic dragon thing that sprints around and jumps everywhere.
[37:04.53]Still going?
[37:19.62]Shit.
[37:21.82]My goodness.
[37:25.32]Whoa.
[37:28.54]Okay, well that's good to know that that happens now.
[37:34.01]holy dog shit this dude this guy we're gonna we're gonna uh we're gonna we're gonna uh no we're not gonna take one of those but I am gonna put resin on let's like in Pokémon what's the thing that gets rid of uh what's the thing that good against frost fire right definitely fire I'm gonna fire the shit out of this guy I'm gonna put better armor on too
[38:05.86]I feel like that could help.
[38:16.65]Fallen Knight, I think, might be my favorite gear in the game.
[38:19.25]It's just, like, overall the best, balanced-wise.
[38:21.31]Okay, I need Fire Resin.
[38:26.70]I don't think Lightning is the trick.
[38:28.00]I think it's probably going to be Fire.
[38:30.24]Alright, let's give it another try.
[38:40.92]That second phase, though, that's going to be... I've got a feeling... I've got a feeling we're going to be here for a while.
[38:51.04]Maybe.
[38:53.54]Hey, look.
[38:54.36]I didn't send it back.
[38:55.04]You know, just...
[39:10.08]Why did we both fall down?
[39:11.62]I'm okay with that.
[39:14.98]But it's not gonna be... Is it gonna be up?
[39:16.98]Okay, I brought it back up.
[39:23.01]He had a better view than I did, and he still fell.
[39:52.12]I am almost certain that this is an optional area.
[39:59.68]I would say as certain as you possibly could be certain of something.
[40:11.90]Shit.
[40:12.93]Please don't come over here.
[40:18.39]Only because this area is really annoying.
[40:20.05]It's very short and the boss is right here.
[40:23.38]Don't think this is... God, what a... He's coming up the stairs.
[40:42.59]I don't want to fall because falling down would get him aggroed.
[40:46.75]And I'd rather just get this guy aggroed so I can just run.
[40:49.31]And just dodge through him.
[41:01.85]Let's try the fire.
[41:04.05]And we're going to do one of these.
[41:07.91]Let's go, buddy.
[41:13.71]That seems to do a lot.
[41:24.01]I hate that you have to skip that.
[41:40.04]I'd rather not have to skip that every time.
[41:54.53]Greedy.
[42:10.20]Oh, I didn't know he did the tail thing if you're behind him.
[42:12.28]Jesus!
[42:14.88]Jesus!
[42:18.14]Get me out of the fucking corner!
[42:19.78]Ugh!
[42:22.85]Ugh!
[42:24.37]This is not... Oh.
[42:29.29]My.
[42:29.99]God.
[42:30.39]Like... There is no time!
[42:38.53]There's no time to do anything in this fight!
[42:41.01]T is just all over you, he just goes nuts!
[42:54.10]Even when I'm trying to get... He's so big.
[42:56.78]Again, like in the corner.
[42:57.84]Man.
[43:01.05]He just flails around like a fucking fish.
[43:07.84]There are dashes in every corner.
[43:11.78]I got a feeling I might not want to fight this guy.
[43:20.49]Maybe I'll come back to the optional sprint around and flail in every corner boss.
[43:25.85]Maybe like after I beat the game.
[43:33.22]Come on, don't get toxic.
[43:46.08]Let's go.
[44:02.47]Ocelot, dear.
[44:03.61]Where's my Ocelot?
[44:06.35]I don't know where he is.
[44:07.45]I might as well just sprint around in every corner and scream and slash my tail in every... Motherfucker.
[44:15.42]Wedging me in.
[44:15.98]Destroy him!
[44:21.13]Hot wax.
[44:23.43]Hot wax!
[44:25.65]Welcome, dude.
[44:26.19]Thanks.
[44:42.34]Woo!
[44:42.96]Ah.
[44:46.39]Well, not my dear little ocelot.
[44:51.01]Alright, so note to self, I have to just let that play.
[44:54.46]Because having to spam X is not something you want to be doing in a boss fight.
[45:22.25]This is not good.
[45:23.67]I'm definitely coming back here another time.
[45:35.23]Sometimes he pretends he's going to swing at you.
[45:38.06]Instead he just goes...
[46:02.17]Okay, I'm backing up.
[46:05.13]Didn't even matter.
[46:05.79]Jesus Christ.
[46:20.76]Oh, you have to, like, get by him.
[46:22.90]Otherwise, he'll keep doing it.
[46:24.06]Listen to me, son.
[46:28.06]I'm your dad.
[46:37.12]Fantasy Cup.
[46:40.00]I don't know if it's going to happen right now, but I'll try.
[46:42.84]Oh, Jesus.
[46:56.27]I don't have any idea.
[46:59.15]I don't have any idea how you're supposed to swing at this guy one time in his second phase without him insta-killing you after you do it.
[47:09.57]There's no rhyme or reason to anything this guy's doing.
[47:16.46]I'm gonna give this one more attempt and I'm going to continue to play the actual game.
[47:34.50]Get good.
[47:36.64]Get good or get lucky.
[47:38.64]I'm not sure which one it is at this boss.
[48:00.75]Mm-hmm.
[48:11.70]No, don't.
[48:24.57]You gotta get the Great Axe.
[48:37.41]So what I'm going to do this time is when he gets to phase two, I'm just going to run away as far as I can.
[48:46.41]I'm just sprinting in a different direction.
[48:58.06]Yeah, that doesn't really hurt at all, so I can go in when he does that.
[49:07.60]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[49:11.04]Hey, James.
[49:13.52]That actually hit me.
[49:15.19]Somehow.
[49:29.45]Thanks for the resub, dude.
[49:54.33]The champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[49:59.07]And chase!
[50:15.48]Alright, get me the fuck away from him.
[50:19.53]Ooh, he just slid that fast across the whole area.
[50:27.93]Oh my god.
[50:43.18]I don't know what the fuck you're supposed to do here.
[50:47.45]It didn't seem like I was... It doesn't seem like I'm able to beat him.
[50:52.72]So, uh, I'm gonna say fuck this guy.
[50:54.62]And I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go to the right.
[51:01.22]I'm gonna go that way.
[51:06.98]Wait.
[51:09.23]That's straight.
[51:12.69]I'm gonna go this way.
[51:20.76]That's not true.
[51:22.56]You're lying to me.
[51:32.09]Just kill the guy?
[51:34.51]I'm going to come back later to kill that guy.
[51:37.82]Because he's severely pissing me off.
[51:45.08]He reminds me of the worst of the worst of the bosses that were in Bloodborne.
[51:50.15]Ludwig Phase One and Bloodstarved Beast.
[51:53.55]Like, put those two together and you have that character.
[52:00.75]What's this guy?
[52:04.76]Seems to be... Okay, hold on.
[52:07.48]I need to... Let me start talking about the other boss and let me play this game.
[52:23.48]Holy shit, he's back to full health.
[52:26.14]Okay.
[52:44.80]Whoa!
[52:46.60]He's back to full health again.
[52:50.40]Okay, hold on.
[52:50.98]Is there something I can destroy in here?
[52:53.66]Who's healing who?
[52:57.09]It's this guy.
[52:59.25]Somebody is.
[52:59.77]I guess not.
[53:12.98]Can I take you out of the church while you keep doing that?
[53:40.90]Just gotta kill him really fast, huh?
[53:44.62]That's not enough stamina to do it.
[54:01.88]Dodging into him.
[54:02.92]Getting stuck.
[54:08.99]Shit!
[54:09.57]Shit!
[54:22.85]Okay, well, there's nothing over here.
[54:24.54]Wait, there is.
[54:34.06]This is a skip as well.
[54:35.44]I hope there's not more of those guys.
[54:45.91]Of course there is.
[54:47.37]Why wouldn't there be?
[54:48.07]I'm going to get you.
[54:53.28]I'm going to get you.
[54:54.28]I'm going to get you.
[54:55.22]I'm going to get you.
[54:57.56]Nope.
[55:06.56]I'm having a lot of trouble in this area.
[55:12.55]Which probably means this is... I would say this has to be the final, if not one of the final areas of the game.
[55:30.92]I don't even need to fight those two.
[55:34.72]Actually, maybe I do.
[55:35.86]Shit.
[55:38.94]No?
[55:40.74]Is he not aggro?
[55:41.34]I just wanna make sure he doesn't aggro.
[55:44.39]We can go up here.
[55:49.55]What the fuck?
[55:51.20]I did not wanna do that!
[56:16.11]Here comes this guy now.
[56:18.89]And this guy's gonna start healing people.
[56:24.21]Jesus.
[56:37.49]This is so hard.
[56:39.37]I'm gonna just go over here.
[56:40.75]Fuck all of you.
[56:43.39]Where's the king?
[56:44.03]Oh, look, a bonfire.
[56:47.79]Bye.
[56:55.43]No!
[56:57.07]No!
[56:57.79]No!
[57:01.77]Get the fuck... Please, God!
[57:05.81]Ugh.
[57:18.45]This is a fucking disaster.
[57:26.21]I'm glad I made it to the disaster part of the game.
[57:28.41]I don't think I'm gonna put those on.
[57:46.90]Don't tell me there's an illusion here when there's not.
[57:50.58]Hold on, I gotta do something real quick.
[58:01.37]There.
[58:03.82]I don't have enough gym badges to fight that Pokémon.
[58:10.03]Not even a Pokémon.
[58:11.99]Oh look, do I actually get to fight like regular enemies besides the ones that are extremely hard in every area?
[58:21.20]Can I just fight against like normal guys for a fucking five seconds?
[58:29.78]Or are they gonna be like all knights here as well?
[58:32.44]And they're gonna, the three of them gonna attack me at the same time.
[58:44.42]Another archer, another archer.
[58:48.78]Hold on, my eyes.
[58:51.28]My eyes are fucking so itchy right now.
[58:57.24]There we go.
[59:03.50]That's the sound of a casual... No, that's the sound of...
[59:39.83]I'm not kidding.
[59:41.59]I really think this game might be harder than Dark Souls 1, 2, and Bloodborne combined.
[59:49.00]I really believe that.
[59:50.08]I truly believe that.
[59:53.64]The enemies in this game are so much more harder to deal with than any of the previous games.
[60:00.12]I can put my fucking hand off my heart and my other hand in the air and swear me in as president, right?
[60:07.23]My hands in the air.
[60:09.01]If you want a Bible, place my fucking heart with a Bible if you want.
[60:13.50]This game is brutal.
[60:16.08]Way more than anything in the previous series.
[60:23.59]It seems like after every corner, every turn, every enemy is so punishing in this game.
[60:30.23]This whole game is just one gigantic, like there's no breathing room in this entire fucking game.
[60:47.74]Bloodborne, like I beat Bloodborne like three times, four times.
[60:52.23]I think that was fucking hard.
[60:54.37]But holy sheep shit.
[60:59.67]I would be lying if I didn't tell you that this was probably the hardest game I've ever played.
[61:04.41]That would be a lie if I were to say that.
[61:06.82]If I were to not say that, I mean.
[61:08.10]If I were to say that, it would be a lie.
[61:10.76]No, wait.
[61:11.20]Reverse that.
[61:13.44]You get the idea.
[61:35.30]Where's the guy?
[61:35.90]Where's the giant fat guy as big as the screen axe dude that swings five times in a row?
[61:40.11]Where is he?
[61:40.61]Come on.
[61:43.17]Yeah, you missed that time, didn't you?
[61:54.88]What is he doing?
[62:03.72]Sausage wagon, what the hell is he just like threw his weapons at me?
[62:24.70]Die!
[62:25.78]He's not dead.
[62:26.42]Oh my god.
[62:42.85]Who just subscribed?
[62:44.77]I am so angry right now.
[62:46.73]I don't even know who's subbed.
[62:47.43]Let's find out.
[62:48.59]Oh, as I already said, more sausage wagon.
[62:52.40]Thanks, dude.
[62:52.78]Welcome.
[62:58.66]trap ahead, huh?
[62:59.72]Well... That's quite the trap.
[63:05.64]Three-legged shirtless hooligans.
[63:08.96]Yeah, we got him, guys.
[63:10.08]What's going on with the sun?
[63:28.80]Oh!
[63:36.99]Spectac!
[63:38.79]Well done dude, thanks.
[63:42.57]Thanks for the two months!
[63:43.97]Two months, cool!
[63:46.58]No, thanks man.
[63:47.20]Let me look over here.
[63:53.60]Don't want to miss anything.
[64:02.89]Somebody's spitting goo at me.
[64:22.32]I think I can actually upgrade my katana again.
[64:31.38]Anything else over there?
[64:32.16]I don't think so.
[64:40.95]Glad you didn't stand up.
[64:52.09]Uh... Uh...
[65:04.80]I will take a rest.
[65:15.80]Which one of those dudes is going to come chase me?
[65:17.85]Place your bets.
[65:19.35]I've got mine on this guy.
[65:21.35]Yeah, you think you can... This guy.
[65:24.27]Go ahead, fool me.
[65:25.05]Oh, you're going to get me.
[65:26.53]It's going to be this guy.
[65:28.63]Nice long spear you got there.
[65:30.17]It's going to be this guy over here.
[65:35.05]Nope, this guy.
[65:36.77]Nope, it's gonna be this guy.
[65:39.29]Nope, I think it's gonna be this one.
[65:41.41]Nope.
[65:45.74]I ain't getting fucking backtracked.
[65:48.72]Okay, it's none of you.
[65:51.82]It's none of them.
[65:55.24]Hmm, I can get up there.
[66:00.66]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[66:11.06]I gotta get the anger out of me.
[66:13.32]I gotta stop being so angry.
[66:15.46]How do I do that?
[66:17.47]Hold on.
[66:17.69]Let me do a breathing exercise.
[66:19.09]I feel like that'll help.
[66:41.63]I'm not gonna get mad at that one.
[67:01.91]Oh god, are they just here forever now?
[67:06.25]Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the two shithead dragons, great.
[67:21.86]Okay, you can't go that way, I don't think.
[67:24.96]I'm gonna hide.
[67:25.50]Those are so cool looking, though.
[67:33.99]Actually, they both just went.
[67:35.01]They both breathed.
[67:36.71]You both breathed.
[67:40.15]No, you can't go that way.
[67:41.07]No way.
[67:42.03]No how.
[67:42.67]Not a chance.
[67:47.64]This is one of these idiots here.
[67:49.46]Great.
[67:49.74]This is gonna be fun.
[67:50.66]Just kick him off.
[68:09.60]Great, Lance.
[68:17.75]DD?
[68:19.35]No, this one's DD.
[68:21.31]E-C, E-D, E-C-E, D-C, D-D, E-C-D-D, E-E.
[68:28.26]Got it.
[68:38.82]Oh my god, did you guys see that part in the stream when Jerma like, raged?
[68:42.63]Oh my god, he's so f- he's fucking crazy!
[68:46.35]Dude's fucked.
[68:47.45]Hey, you gotta check out this stream, man.
[68:49.01]This dude is fucked.
[68:54.92]Is that what you guys are doing?
[68:58.04]Dude, he got to this point.
[68:59.22]Dude, he got to this point with, like, dragons.
[69:02.02]Dude is, this kid is fucked.
[69:04.48]You gotta, like, come check it out.
[69:11.73]Yeah, dude, something fucking wrong with this guy, man.
[69:14.35]Come check this out.
[69:15.29]He sucks and he's like a fucking psycho.
[69:17.05]Come check it out, man.
[69:17.97]Check this out.
[69:18.47]Check it out.
[69:18.85]So what am I supposed to do here?
[69:35.92]Should I go backwards?
[69:41.43]I can't really go that way.
[69:43.49]Can't go up straight ahead.
[69:44.83]Is there another way for me to go or do I have to go fight the thing that's going to make me extremely upset?
[69:53.06]What about dropping down?
[69:53.88]Looks like I can get down.
[69:56.94]Try that.
[70:10.34]Fire's still going, fire's still going.
[70:16.31]Unless I missed a spot where I could fall.
[70:25.82]I mean, I'm just gonna go for a dive.
[70:30.76]I'm just gonna dive off the edge.
[70:39.15]If they have that, just burn forever.
[70:47.65]Whatever.
[70:53.97]There must have been another way to go.
[70:59.45]Go back down there with those dudes.
[71:05.27]What the hell does this say?
[71:19.30]Don't kill me.
[71:23.90]Maybe there was a better way to go the other way.
[71:29.24]I'm not sure.
[71:32.74]I got his helmet.
[71:33.38]Cool.
[71:42.24]Down that way.
[71:44.52]I need to do some more investigative gating.
[72:10.02]Hold on, I gotta like do the Superman Casio keyboard MIDI to get me ready and pumped up.
[72:18.45]I'm ready.
[72:37.23]There is a little spot that I didn't go in.
[72:38.67]Because the big fat guy was here and I freaked out and ran.
[72:48.44]Good.
[72:49.50]He rolled a one.
[72:51.82]Thank God.
[72:55.34]What are you doing?
[72:59.21]Come on, let's go.
[73:07.73]I really hope he cannot climb stairs.
[73:10.49]Or ladders, for that matter.
[73:13.73]It was an illusion.
[73:15.71]Where did that guy go?
[73:17.39]He just fell from up here?
[73:21.37]Where is the big guy?
[73:23.48]Where's the big guy?
[73:28.60]I'm scared because that doesn't make any sense at all.
[73:34.22]He wasn't even there before.
[73:41.66]He just appeared.
[73:44.65]He just threw his axes.
[73:46.61]I'm kind of curious as to what he's going to do here.
[73:48.25]But no.
[73:49.25]Not worth it.
[73:49.77]Just get me out of there.
[73:50.45]That's an interesting painting.
[73:57.63]Is that a painting of the guy downstairs?
[74:03.74]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[74:07.90]Kunchoi.
[74:09.82]Welcome back.
[74:10.82]Thanks for subbing.
[74:15.14]I got some new stuff.
[74:15.98]I gotta sell a lot of this stuff.
[74:19.03]Ugh.
[74:31.12]Look at that slow roll.
[74:32.84]That ain't gonna happen anymore.
[74:38.77]My poise.
[74:40.57]I'm really concerned about my poise.
[74:45.64]How do I get that to 25?
[74:46.26]Because that's when you move the fastest, right?
[74:53.02]Less than 50%?
[74:53.36]20%?
[74:53.56]Let's stay with this.
[75:03.37]Sacred Bloom Shield.
[75:04.39]So...
[75:12.34]Is this the way you're supposed to go?
[75:13.72]How would you ever know?
[75:14.46]If there was not something... Like, if you didn't find the illusion wall... How would you ever know to do this?
[75:24.39]Oh, no, it's not.
[75:25.07]Are those enemies?
[75:31.25]Oh!
[75:36.74]You know when you blow on a dandelion?
[75:40.32]That's what it looks like.
[75:41.08]There's dandelion dragons over here.
[75:45.88]Shilar 90.
[75:56.54]Welcome, dude.
[75:59.16]Or is it Shilar?
[76:00.90]Or is it Chiller?
[76:03.72]Whatever it is.
[76:05.38]Welcome to the family.
[76:09.69]Big family here.
[76:10.71]Got a big one.
[76:11.35]Big family.
[76:19.65]And yet again, I'm at a loss for what I'm supposed to do.
[76:23.14]Here we go.
[76:26.64]Oh, this dude is fucked.
[76:28.46]Dude, you gotta check this guy out.
[76:33.11]This dude is fucked up.
[76:37.44]And he's fucking ugly.
[76:38.74]Oh, he's wicked ugly.
[76:41.49]And I'd be like, oh fuck, did people say that now?
[76:50.91]There has to be someone with me to wrap around to not have to deal with these dragons.
[77:04.64]Oh boy!
[77:05.66]We both were not stopping.
[77:18.75]Any more illusions or anything like that?
[77:20.45]I can't go this way.
[77:30.88]Refresh.
[77:37.76]Old man rage pisses his pants on stream.
[77:40.54]Check it out, bro.
[77:42.84]Bro.
[77:45.84]Bro.
[77:46.26]The only thing that's over here is this guy.
[77:58.71]I mean, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna try.
[78:02.00]I'm trying.
[78:02.52]I'm trying.
[78:03.76]I've made it.
[78:06.32]I think.
[78:07.70]Kind of.
[78:10.59]If you call this making it.
[78:15.99]You going... You going night-night?
[78:17.71]Alright, have a good night, man.
[78:18.87]Have a good night, Minxie.
[78:24.21]Let your days be long and your hardships few.
[78:28.76]What is the thing that the Drani says?
[78:30.64]I hear it.
[78:32.86]I hear things.
[78:38.04]Shit.
[78:41.55]What are these guys throwing?
[78:47.95]Oh, boy.
[78:48.45]Is it a bomb?
[78:50.23]What is... I...
[78:53.60]Oh, there was a person underneath.
[78:55.79]It was a slug person.
[78:56.99]That just freaked me out.
[78:57.91]I thought someone was throwing a bomb at me.
[79:02.53]Didn't that look like somebody tossed a mine up behind me?
[79:04.71]Pip steer.
[79:07.29]Thanks for seven.
[79:07.73]That's what it looked like on my screen.
[79:09.27]It looked like somebody threw a mine up and was about to detonate it.
[79:16.02]Somebody tossed a bouncing Betty at me.
[79:38.71]This Junkrat.
[79:48.18]Who's the tree?
[79:48.76]No, it was the weird alien person down there.
[79:52.22]You have to have a magnet in your... I hate when they do that.
[80:10.07]What is going on?
[80:10.71]What's my guy doing?
[80:13.59]He was just like, oh, this is empty.
[80:15.67]It's not empty.
[80:19.29]What?
[80:22.96]He's like getting mad.
[80:24.28]I can't do it.
[80:28.78]The ghost mist, it makes it so I can't drink?
[80:33.34]Okay.
[80:38.51]Do I need to just avoid this guy doing that?
[80:40.19]How long does it last?
[80:46.88]Come on!
[80:47.46]There it is.
[80:55.12]Should I do another one?
[80:56.02]I should probably do another one.
[81:05.16]Lloyd's talisman I could do that.
[81:07.26]I could do that.
[81:08.18]I could do that to them see how they like it.
[81:13.82]Oh For fuck's sake mate Be wary of pointless Pointless is there nothing here Pointless out for fuck's sake mine.
[81:30.01]Oh
[81:33.08]Can't be pointless, right?
[81:35.22]There's got to be a reason to come over here.
[81:40.38]Is there like an item in the corner?
[81:42.04]Let's see, let's see.
[81:48.64]There really is nothing over here, huh?
[81:51.62]Well, everybody's such a troll in this game.
[81:53.10]You never know.
[81:53.48]There could be like the best weapon in the game is right here.
[81:57.86]Oh, I'm going this way.
[82:02.81]Stop following me.
[82:08.52]Stop following me.
[82:23.59]I'm glad I had more than a quarter of a second to get away from you.
[82:31.22]How is Dark Souls 3 so far?
[82:32.34]Is it meeting up to the expectations?
[82:35.23]Um, yeah.
[82:38.67]I think it's by far the hardest game in the entire series.
[82:43.97]I think it's good.
[82:44.59]I would say comparing it to my baby Bloodborne.
[82:52.92]I think I like Bloodborne better.
[82:54.64]I just do.
[82:57.90]I just do.
[83:03.34]I think there's more to do in this game, but I like the game Bloodborne better.
[83:11.76]The video game Bloodborne, I believe, is better than Dark Souls 3.
[83:19.28]I don't want that thing to wrap around me.
[83:36.11]Like I can't use an Estus because the one stupid asshole upstairs Okay, I'm not gonna go down there for no reason
[84:12.88]Can he shoot breathing here?
[84:15.26]I'm gonna walk up there and he's just gonna breathe fire.
[84:20.16]But, to follow up with that, to give another answer to the question that I was asked, I think this is the best Dark Souls game, for sure.
[84:32.09]This is Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3.
[84:34.77]I would say this is absolutely the best of those three.
[84:40.15]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its sexiness.
[84:44.15]Jeez, he does breathe down here, doesn't he?
[84:45.51]Shredded Cheese Man, welcome back.
[84:48.93]Thank you.
[84:52.96]Ah, man.
[84:54.62]Maybe I can't go that way.
[84:56.40]I'm gonna take another gander.
[84:59.64]No way.
[85:08.46]Shit.
[85:14.05]Where else am I supposed to go?
[85:19.43]There are two Cheesemans in the chat.
[85:21.45]Dr. Cheese and the Shredded Cheeseman.
[85:25.44]So he goes forward.
[85:28.52]It might be possible for me to get over there.
[85:32.16]But I'm going to say probably not.
[85:34.00]So I'm going to try to go the other way.
[85:37.14]The other dragon's not as mean.
[85:48.27]Do I have to deal with this stupid thing down here?
[85:57.61]Where am I?
[86:01.73]There's an item back there.
[86:02.65]I'm gonna try to bait him out and then go get the item.
[86:12.87]Well, it's a good thing I killed him.
[86:15.39]Otherwise, he would have turned into one of those things.
[86:19.29]Ugh.
[86:20.60]Ugh.
[86:21.90]Ugh.
[86:27.04]Let's try it.
[86:28.80]I definitely don't want to come back here again for no reason if there's a decent item over here.
[86:37.17]Come on out.
[86:38.83]Keep coming.
[86:40.43]Keep coming.
[86:48.10]Ben Elnor.
[86:50.78]That was worth it.
[86:51.32]It's too twinkling time then.
[86:52.58]Thanks, Ben.
[86:54.72]Welcome back.
[87:05.39]Thank you, Benjamin.
[87:09.81]Lightning urn.
[87:13.77]Fuck a bug.
[87:16.27]Bug.
[87:17.45]Bug.
[87:20.59]Oh, come on.
[87:22.29]I just swung there.
[87:23.65]I just swung in that exact spot.
[87:30.82]Count to 10.
[87:32.10]Count to 10.
[87:34.12]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[87:36.80]Still mad about that because that was just dumb.
[87:44.19]I said ambush ahead not ambush here Jesus I'm gonna get backstabbed I almost did I might have just insta killed me
[88:21.99]Somebody's dead over there.
[88:24.21]I feel your pain.
[88:27.30]Oh, no.
[88:29.54]No.
[88:33.02]Oh, no.
[88:37.50]Oh, no.
[88:41.31]What's up there?
[88:41.89]He's gonna hit me through the wall, too.
[88:46.09]This is not cool.
[88:51.72]Where do I go?
[88:52.38]Where do I go?
[88:53.18]Down here?
[88:54.76]No.
[88:56.04]Wait a minute.
[88:57.24]Wait a minute.
[89:02.82]Oh, they're all coming down.
[89:04.12]This is not what I wanted to do.
[89:09.96]Jesus.
[89:11.58]Listen to me, son.
[89:13.22]I'm your dad.
[89:16.48]Destroy him!
[89:21.53]Not sausages, again.
[89:22.87]Not sausages.
[89:25.05]You're everywhere as sausages.
[89:26.29]You're everywhere, huh?
[89:32.01]I can reset now.
[89:32.77]Maybe that guy will just be down here now.
[89:34.21]That'd be great.
[89:44.59]Yeah, I gotta watch out for the soccer hooligans.
[89:49.39]They tend to show up over there.
[89:53.89]Well, maybe with luck, that big, huge guy with the giant spin move will not be up here.
[90:02.47]That would make me... No, he's still up here.
[90:08.43]Alright, well, I kind of have to fight him, don't I?
[90:19.16]One, two...
[90:41.29]I thought I got under it.
[90:52.57]God damn it!
[91:06.60]Now he's stuck there and this is going to be so annoying because he's going to be sitting there and I can't get him to come up.
[91:13.76]No, of course he does.
[91:14.58]The timing.
[91:20.47]Yike.
[91:24.23]I'm not sure where to go here.
[91:28.19]Over here?
[91:30.94]I don't know.
[91:37.30]That's the only place I can really go except for this way?
[91:41.41]No, is this?
[91:42.83]That's the bonfire.
[91:49.01]What the fuck am I supposed to be doing?
[91:56.39]I don't know.
[92:01.61]That's right there.
[92:02.49]That doesn't lead to anything.
[92:16.17]A lot of confusion in this area.
[92:21.71]Unless maybe...
[92:47.84]Both directions seem to be leading into no... Nothing.
[93:03.93]Yay.
[93:07.64]This used to be a main haystream.
[93:15.87]Actually, no, it never was, was it?
[93:18.43]I never did that.
[93:19.09]I was talked about doing it, unfortunately.
[93:21.91]I need to, like, just... This guy has to die, and then I can take a second to look around.
[93:34.37]How does he stand up there?
[93:41.62]He rolled a one.
[94:07.99]Even if you dodge that, I don't even know how you get away from not getting hit by it.
[94:10.63]There's nowhere to go.
[94:27.34]And I'm seriously gonna get hit by an Estus Blast thing.
[94:31.55]Who?
[94:32.87]That guy.
[94:34.85]Okay.
[95:00.40]Thought I could hit him with a backstab there.
[95:02.03]Alright, give me the key.
[95:14.11]Give me the key to the area.
[95:15.19]Give me the key to the city.
[95:29.03]This is the end of here.
[95:30.43]Alright, let's look.
[95:33.27]That's the bottom area.
[95:38.57]It just leads up around again.
[95:40.03]Um... So there really is nothing over here.
[95:57.19]Can't get up there.
[96:01.84]Can I stand on this?
[96:13.25]No.
[96:13.51]Maybe I have to get further on the bridge?
[96:20.21]Should I throw like a knife at the dragon?
[96:23.36]Can you even do that?
[96:24.06]Can I shoot the dragon with a bow?
[96:32.41]I don't know.
[96:36.01]I'm just kind of stuck down here until I try to go up.
[96:39.33]Unless there's a place I can go over this way.
[96:40.55]Which I didn't see.
[96:45.03]Try running past the dragons.
[96:46.38]I will insta-die.
[96:50.62]I can try to run on the bridge.
[96:54.04]And jump off to the other side.
[96:55.60]If I stay on that bridge for longer than five seconds, I'm dead.
[97:08.33]I'm gonna have to try stick your head in the ground like an ostrich There was the one spot over on the left But it looked like I couldn't make it because he was gonna breathe fire at me I maybe I'll try running past that before he breathes I Go that way remember I said no I can't go this way I'm gonna have to try
[97:41.31]I'm probably going to die here, but I just want to see if I can get any further than what I did.
[97:51.82]Why did they not breathe fire that time?
[97:54.30]Why are they not breathing fire?
[97:58.55]Okay, that... Okay.
[98:02.17]Am I crazy, or did they just wait way too long?
[98:07.02]Okay, something's going on here.
[98:08.92]Something's going on.
[98:11.34]Something's going on here.
[98:20.49]Um... Alright, I can...
[98:29.61]So I can make it over.
[98:30.65]I thought I was safe when I got past the bridge.
[98:39.04]Okay, so I can make it past the bridge, but they turn around and shoot fire.
[98:43.32]No, not this time.
[98:49.44]I'd like to know what changed.
[98:55.49]They just decided not to breathe fire the time I ran by.
[98:59.16]And now I am just totally screwed here.
[99:13.15]Okay.
[99:14.97]Hey, I made it over here.
[99:19.09]I'll take whatever this item is.
[99:20.73]Hey, I got a bone shard.
[99:23.25]Yeah, nice.
[99:28.94]Anything else I can do on this ledge?
[99:32.02]I don't think so.
[99:35.70]Just stay there.
[99:36.24]What if I just stayed there and went up and left?
[99:39.04]Stay there forever.
[99:43.76]There.
[99:44.20]So I'm gonna try it again.
[99:45.82]I'm actually gonna go do the bone shard.
[99:55.76]That would give me the plus six.
[99:59.99]I just run past all these chumps.
[100:18.94]Let's do this.
[100:22.06]I'm going to see if it's possible to just shoot the fucking guy.
[100:30.00]Do I have any bullets?
[100:32.12]Do I have any bullets?
[100:34.56]No.
[100:36.29]I have, like, the other arrows, but when the hell am I ever going to use?
[100:38.71]Dragonslayer arrows.
[100:40.25]Oh.
[100:41.33]Oh, I'd love to use these.
[100:42.53]Hmm.
[100:47.07]Do have a little bit of a dragon problem, don't I?
[100:51.99]Which one?
[100:53.61]Who's going to get killed by the dragon arrow?
[101:03.40]How do I switch the... What arrow is in the right spot?
[101:12.38]Okay.
[101:16.49]I can't shoot that.
[101:19.41]What?
[101:24.27]Why can I not shoot it?
[101:31.49]Are these bolts?
[101:32.77]No, these are arrows, right?
[101:42.44]This bow is cool looking.
[101:44.50]There we go.
[101:46.80]Alright.
[101:47.78]Let's try it.
[101:48.36]I'm gonna shoot him right in the fucking head.
[101:51.92]Look at how huge this arrow is!
[101:54.02]You messed with the wrong puppy!
[102:07.84]These are not dragons slaying him.
[102:13.02]I'd like to slay the dragon with the dragon slaying bullets.
[102:17.90]What about this one?
[102:18.60]Are you weaker?
[102:27.50]So, they don't jump down.
[102:36.97]That's not really doing a whole lot.
[102:40.83]That's a failed experiment.
[102:42.29]It'd be funny if I could just... How much are dragon arrows?
[102:53.32]Can I buy them from the store?
[102:55.86]I think I'm just going to go get them.
[102:57.58]Spend $20,000 and just kill this guy from far away with dragon arrows.
[103:02.10]That would be fun.
[103:15.79]Abort mission!
[103:16.39]Abort mission!
[103:28.73]How much money do I have?
[103:29.77]I'm gonna cheese the hell out of these two.
[103:37.24]If I could get my souls back, this would be way easier.
[103:44.36]So I'm going to reload the area and sprint.
[103:45.74]Because that's what I did last time when I got over there.
[103:52.38]How did I get over there that time when they just decided not to shoot me?
[103:58.04]Oh, you know, I kind of just don't feel like doing it.
[104:00.36]I have to go immediately.
[104:05.91]Now, is there a place I can go that is safe?
[104:12.73]Okay, I got my souls.
[104:14.76]Where's the safe place?
[104:16.64]Where's the one safe spot?
[104:17.84]Right here.
[104:22.04]Alright, yeah, this is the one time when I'm okay to be wedged in a corner.
[104:30.51]Alright, let me get that item.
[104:32.65]Hahaha.
[104:43.27]I don't think you're supposed to do it like this.
[104:48.63]I could E.T.
[104:49.45]bone home.
[104:50.29]Should I just E.T.
[104:51.10]bone home?
[104:55.24]What else is over here?
[104:56.26]I could go that way.
[105:01.84]Nothing's right there, and there's no way for me to open this door.
[105:05.14]I don't see a device.
[105:09.51]Yeah, we're gonna E.T.
[105:10.49]bone home here.
[105:11.99]And I'm just gonna shoot this dragon fucking a hundred times with arrows.
[105:25.62]Okay, how much are those dragon slaying great arrows?
[105:27.98]Because I think that's what I just want to do.
[105:30.50]Okay, it was 200.
[105:32.12]200 was about, what, 5%?
[105:40.25]Do you sell them?
[105:43.81]Oni Slayer, Great Arrow, Wood Arrow.
[105:47.47]No, you don't have like the Dragon Arrows.
[105:51.13]Wood Arrow.
[105:51.87]What if I just buy a ton of... I'm just gonna shoot him a hundred times.
[105:54.05]Yeah.
[105:57.69]I'm just gonna shoot... I'm gonna sit there... Even if it does like 30 damage, I'm gonna shoot him fucking 500 times.
[106:01.71]Right?
[106:11.16]We'll buy the good ones.
[106:15.42]I'm gonna buy a hundred of these.
[106:23.39]Wood arrows.
[106:27.47]Alright, how many was I allowed to have?
[106:32.84]And I have this thing, which I have, it's good.
[106:37.98]Let me make sure I can actually shoot the damn thing more than 50 times.
[106:41.24]I can shoot a hundred fucking times.
[106:53.93]And I can do poison arrows, moonlit arrows, in case he doesn't die.
[106:56.70]I just thought I wasn't going to do this.
[107:00.66]You thought this was some kind of joke?
[107:04.80]Thought I was messing around?
[107:09.18]Okay, well, I can't use this bow.
[107:10.59]I have to use the other bow.
[107:13.07]To use the longbow.
[107:17.11]Let's do it.
[107:21.91]Let's go.
[107:22.39]Alright, I would get comfortable.
[107:28.62]Go get comfy.
[107:30.02]Get a snack.
[107:31.06]Get a drink.
[107:33.16]Go do whatever you want.
[107:34.46]Open up a tab of music.
[107:38.27]I'm shooting this dragon a hundred times.
[107:43.94]The one on the left seems more dangerous, so I'm gonna shoot him.
[107:46.28]He's the one that's getting all 100 arrows.
[107:53.67]That one missed?!
[107:59.65]Is this gonna work?
[108:05.36]How come someone's doing more damage?
[108:08.12]Should I shoot him right in the face?
[108:10.30]And when he comes back down, I'll get him right in the face.
[108:12.94]See if it's more.
[108:13.96]What if I shoot him in the mouth?
[108:15.06]That'd be just like a Disney movie, right?
[108:19.13]It does more damage in the head.
[108:22.19]When he moves around.
[108:30.65]Shit.
[108:35.67]I'm just barely not gonna be able to do it, I think.
[108:38.07]What about his hand?
[108:38.73]Alright, his hand doesn't move and it does a good, consistent damage.
[108:44.41]What about, like, the fingernail?
[108:46.35]Nope.
[108:59.84]It's not gonna be enough.
[109:04.92]What in the wing?
[109:08.28]No, I can't hit him in the wing.
[109:09.96]Okay, his wing does not take damage.
[109:14.68]Woo!
[109:17.38]His hand's moving!
[109:20.34]This is irritating him, I think.
[109:26.39]I feel like if I do this enough times, he's gonna let go and run away.
[109:34.47]Doesn't it look like this is pissing him off?
[109:40.45]Let me get some stamina.
[109:43.63]Look at how bruised up that part of his arm is.
[109:50.51]This is going up.
[110:00.60]Go back to the fingers.
[110:01.54]Let's go back to his hand.
[110:05.73]Right in the knuckle.
[110:07.10]I'm going to shoot him right in the webbing of the fingers.
[110:09.70]That would suck.
[110:10.26]Right there.
[110:10.58]That's perfect.
[110:23.73]He's almost halfway.
[110:24.49]Alright.
[110:25.71]If I can get him to halfway, I do have other arrows to shoot.
[110:36.09]Do I hold it down longer?
[110:37.13]No, it doesn't matter.
[110:39.91]Hold on, what if I get a little bit closer?
[110:41.91]Well, does this damage fall off, right?
[110:43.59]What if I get, like, right here?
[110:44.53]You know what I mean?
[110:50.03]Like, this will be more damage because of this damage fall off.
[110:56.46]Yeah.
[110:58.76]That one did 90.
[111:04.41]Glor... Glorels.
[111:07.24]Glorels.
[111:07.94]I'm going to destroy him.
[111:09.06]It's just going to take a little bit longer than I thought originally.
[111:11.90]That's because I hit him in the face when he came around.
[111:16.86]That's what I'm going to do.
[111:18.86]Perfect strategy.
[111:22.78]Almost.
[111:28.46]Yep, that's the strategy.
[111:29.94]He's going to put his face right over here and it's going to be 90 damage every time.
[111:37.92]Oh, come on.
[111:38.49]Where are you?
[111:40.01]Breathe more fire.
[111:40.89]Why is this working?
[111:57.30]Okay.
[112:05.31]This is great.
[112:07.05]That didn't hit anything.
[112:15.03]What is hurting him?
[112:15.85]I didn't hit him.
[112:20.30]What a good stream.
[112:30.74]Hit!
[112:35.57]It's so funny because there's definitely some actual way to do this, but I don't care.
[112:40.89]Couldn't kill the dragon with a bunch of 100 arrows.
[112:47.07]I'm just going to make it.
[112:47.99]Barely.
[112:48.35]I have to hit the rest of them in his face.
[112:50.35]I've got to get 90 like 20 more times.
[113:09.94]Come on.
[113:12.76]It's like watching a warrior defeat a dinosaur with a plastic knife.
[113:28.70]Come on.
[113:29.10]Come on.
[113:30.72]You only have a few more hits on you.
[113:35.32]Ten more should do it.
[113:41.60]Maybe fewer.
[113:50.05]I just saw somebody say, this sucks.
[113:59.08]I've got a beefy-weefy 23 welcome thanks.
[114:02.38]I wonder what happens when he dies.
[114:07.32]What is he gonna do?
[114:10.68]Does he just die up there?
[114:11.68]Or does he fly away?
[114:14.68]Or do I get like a dragon bone item?
[114:23.13]He's gonna die.
[114:23.67]He's dead.
[114:25.67]He's dead.
[114:30.63]I killed him.
[114:38.52]Okay, they're both dead.
[114:41.60]Good.
[114:43.44]Okay.
[114:43.82]What were we doing?
[114:46.24]What were we up to?
[114:48.09]Did he drop something?
[114:50.65]I have to get up there and see what he dropped.
[114:57.81]He's just like, oh, you killed my brother.
[114:59.61]I feel like he's faking this.
[115:02.84]Wouldn't you?
[115:07.94]Yeah, that was a good 97 arrows.
[115:11.70]Now I can take this off because my equipment is making me fat roll.
[115:17.50]What's up here?
[115:19.47]I can look around wherever I want right now.
[115:22.23]This is great.
[115:24.81]He died of a broken heart.
[115:25.93]Alright, I'm done.
[115:34.20]See you later.
[115:41.65]That guy's throwing bombs.
[115:44.44]Oh, there's more than one of you throwing grenades.
[115:56.31]Yeah, and there's like one of those spaghetti monsters up there too.
[115:58.39]It's too dark in here.
[116:10.06]That guy's freaking me out with the bomb, man.
[116:11.50]He's gonna, like, hit me in the face with one of these.
[116:22.58]Wow!
[116:24.13]I almost just insta-died.
[116:32.59]Oh, you're annoying.
[116:36.35]Anything in here?
[116:36.89]Any items?
[116:45.48]I killed the dragon via acupuncture.
[116:49.44]That is an extremely accurate statement.
[116:52.82]That is so accurate.
[116:53.87]I can climb the ladder, but I don't think I want to at the moment.
[117:04.21]I'd like to get to like another bonfire.
[117:16.85]Come on, I'm trying to lock on to you.
[117:22.63]Thankfully I have all my Estus Flask.
[117:26.33]Estus flasks.
[117:37.32]Throw a fire bomb in the fireplace?
[117:44.18]Would be interesting if it worked.
[117:52.83]Hey, look.
[117:53.35]It's a chest.
[117:56.44]I wonder what this chest is.
[118:04.36]Why is this one acting different?
[118:09.26]This one's on his all fours.
[118:11.62]I've never seen one do this before.
[118:21.89]Now he's standing up.
[118:49.98]Titanite scale.
[118:50.74]Nice, nice, nice.
[118:51.92]Go back to the ring.
[118:54.50]Hey, go back to the ring, ring girl.
[119:04.79]I really don't want to fight that.
[119:05.91]I'm going to have to pee.
[119:08.09]Get me to a bonfire so I can please pee.
[119:16.97]Curious as to what's over in the corner over there, though.
[119:23.62]Hopefully I can bait him to come down so I can wrap around.
[119:26.16]No, only this idiot's coming over here.
[119:59.37]I'm gonna go with the bomb tactic here.
[120:02.37]I think he's just stuck in the wall.
[120:06.25]Does he come out?
[120:10.57]What the fuck was that?
[120:11.53]What was that?
[120:16.84]Where the hell are you people coming from?
[120:20.54]Where are you coming from?
[120:21.88]Where was that guy?
[120:36.64]Uh-huh.
[120:39.16]Now I'm confident I can go and get you.
[120:44.19]I'm not confident.
[120:45.11]I'm not confident.
[120:46.25]I'm not confident.
[120:50.07]Confident.
[120:55.71]What is going on?
[120:56.39]Mwahaha, the French.
[120:59.48]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[121:02.76]Rock'em, sock'em.
[121:05.83]What was that connected to?
[121:06.95]Was that the dragon?
[121:11.69]That was the dragon.
[121:14.20]Yeah.
[121:14.72]Okay.
[121:16.16]So... Rock'em, Sock'em, thanks for subbing.
[121:20.00]I was just coming to the realization that those hundred shots did not need to be fired.
[121:24.82]Because I could just run by and sneak over here and kill this guy.
[121:27.34]But... Alright.
[121:28.26]It's okay.
[121:34.13]Okay.
[121:36.40]I'm going to go around and do it again.
[121:37.72]I'm going to do it to the other dragon.
[121:41.48]They're already dead.
[121:45.83]Why would they still have a living parasite thing when they're already dead?
[121:59.56]What's the other direction?
[122:05.75]Titanite scale.
[122:09.61]Oh, there's a bridge.
[122:10.67]Maybe I can climb up the ladder.
[122:20.68]Yeah, these things aren't even dragons.
[122:22.12]These are puppets.
[122:25.48]Those parasite things are just being puppeteers.
[122:36.53]Go over here.
[122:39.33]I got to be careful because I do have a ton of souls and not want to lose them right now.
[122:51.84]I hear all kinds of shit that I don't really want to get into right now.
[123:00.20]But we're pulling this.
[123:01.08]I think that's going to open the gate, right?
[123:02.26]Yep.
[123:04.28]Well, that's an easy way to get through.
[123:11.85]Should I just drop down?
[123:12.97]Yeah, I got six flasks.
[123:19.59]I should be okay.
[123:22.27]Oh, no.
[123:26.36]I'm going to bone on out.
[123:28.28]I don't even know what's in here.
[123:30.96]This huge guy that can two-hit kill me.
[123:33.00]I'm boning home.
[123:36.82]Where's my bones?
[123:44.51]I have a lot of soul, dead soul things as well.
[123:51.45]Oh boy.
[123:51.97]I think I have enough to do this again, to upgrade.
[124:01.21]I do.
[124:02.36]This thing get to plus eight.
[124:05.36]Oh, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, get it to plus nine, baby.
[124:09.94]Tight night's lab and this thing will be maxed out.
[124:15.83]That should help a lot.
[124:17.12]That should help quite a bit.
[124:26.28]What do you have that I want?
[124:30.20]Firebombs.
[124:30.76]Because I want to throw them at the other dragon.
[124:41.01]How many of these do I have?
[124:42.47]Five.
[124:45.37]Let me just see how much it takes to level up.
[124:52.81]Come back with a hundred more arrows.
[124:54.07]That would be great.
[125:01.80]Endurance to 30.
[125:02.56]Crush!
[125:17.73]Crush.
[125:24.19]Crunch.
[125:33.65]30, 30, 40.
[125:33.93]That's where I want to end up at the very end of the game.
[125:38.52]May the force be with you.
[125:44.32]May the force be with you.
[125:52.79]Actually, I'll sell you some stuff, too.
[125:56.57]Preferably the weapons I'm not going to be using, like the Great Lance.
[126:02.54]Claw.
[126:03.24]Cool, but no.
[126:04.74]Not cool.
[126:07.68]Sell the crossbow.
[126:08.78]What am I going to need it for?
[126:22.18]I think I don't have enough motor.
[126:26.10]Okie dokie.
[126:28.72]Let me just check one last thing.
[126:31.16]96 plus... No.
[126:34.67]273.
[126:34.71]No.
[126:34.83]Dark deep.
[126:53.89]A faith scaling.
[126:54.81]Damn.
[127:00.79]I need to... I'm pretty sure I need to go to the swamp area to get the gem that I want for infusion.
[127:05.92]Maybe I'll do that in a little bit after I see what's down the hall here.
[127:10.54]Yeah.
[127:12.04]Alright.
[127:12.36]I'm going to pee.
[127:14.60]So... I'm going to take a quick two or three minute break.
[127:19.61]I suggest you all do the same.
[127:22.37]If not, then hey.
[127:24.47]Take a look at that fire.
[127:26.61]BRB
[129:58.59]Hmm.
[130:03.61]Let's try.
[130:04.49]Should have just upgraded the dragon bow.
[130:11.36]Or upgraded the bow to kill the dragon.
[130:13.24]Yeah.
[130:14.32]Yeah, but 20-20 hindsight.
[130:15.68]I was just, I don't know.
[130:17.32]You know me.
[130:18.84]I just kind of go and just fucking do it.
[130:23.36]Plus six.
[130:25.16]How many bon- wasn't plus five as far as you could get in any of the other Dark Souls?
[130:30.58]For some reason that number, plus five, is burned in my brain.
[130:39.87]Can you iron a mouse pad?
[130:41.61]You need to iron your mouse pad.
[130:48.18]Dang.
[130:56.16]How wrinkly is your mousepad?
[130:58.82]I just picture a really wrinkled-ass mousepad.
[131:08.48]It's curling around.
[131:09.36]I would just grab another mousepad.
[131:13.02]Mousepads are pretty cheap, aren't they?
[131:14.15]Aren't they, like, less than, like, two, three dollars?
[131:24.39]Kind of knew he was coming.
[131:37.30]He's getting healed, too, by this stupid enemy over on the left.
[131:48.91]Oh, come on.
[132:01.08]What is... Why are you back to life?
[132:06.06]What enemy does that?
[132:06.92]I need to figure that out.
[132:14.32]I didn't block that.
[132:15.74]Didn't parry that, I guess.
[132:18.95]Now he doesn't have it anymore.
[132:27.83]I'm probably dead.
[132:28.79]Nope.
[132:32.24]I have so much trouble with these guys.
[132:35.57]Out of any enemy I think in the game, these guys give me the most trouble.
[132:46.54]I'm trying to just get behind them.
[132:49.16]Oh my god.
[132:53.18]I thought they stepped away from that from Dark Souls 2.
[132:57.95]Where enemies just pivot to wherever you're currently sitting.
[133:03.73]Because that was the dumb thing about Dark Souls 2 that I thought everybody hated.
[133:09.95]Was enemies just pivoting like a magnet to your body.
[133:13.99]I thought that was something that they... They shouldn't... Take the fucking customer feedback next time.
[133:23.12]Customer is king.
[133:24.82]Okay?
[133:32.58]Game sucks.
[133:49.35]Oh shit, I thought that was... Oh god!
[133:57.20]There is no dealing with you.
[133:59.18]Now I have your fucking friend to deal with too.
[134:11.92]And that guy's- that guy's alive again.
[134:13.58]You see that fucking dickhead up on the stairs is alive again?
[134:20.99]Unbelievable.
[134:30.27]Those f- fuck those stupid knights.
[134:45.45]Fuck all the enemies in this game.
[134:50.69]I'm gonna fucking sprint at you!
[134:52.92]I'm gonna run out there and fucking slash like three times!
[134:55.18]Here we go!
[134:56.84]Oh, I missed him.
[134:57.60]Oh, sorry, I'll get him this time.
[134:58.80]I can live forever long.
[134:59.71]There's a fucking magician behind me.
[135:01.21]Oh, no!
[135:02.55]Man, he got me.
[135:04.46]It's okay, my fucking dumb magician friend will just bring me back to life.
[135:07.33]You think you're gonna kill me?
[135:08.63]Nah, I'm just gonna swing at you.
[135:10.01]I almost killed you in one hit.
[135:11.37]That's what I'm lightning time.
[135:13.11]Oh, did you see my lightning enchanted sword?
[135:14.51]It's so cool.
[135:14.93]I got it on eBay.
[135:15.49]What do you think of that?
[135:16.89]Oh, I mean, it's almost one hit to kill you again.
[135:18.66]Oh, just... Fucking God.
[135:23.52]Did you see her back to full health?
[135:24.86]Yeah, thanks to my good buddy over here with the lantern.
[135:33.60]We try to kill him?
[135:34.30]Is that what you want to do?
[135:35.66]Well, if you go after him, I'm just going to insta-kill you.
[135:38.22]So, you know, just go try to kill him.
[135:39.74]I dare you.
[135:43.24]See, I told you.
[135:43.88]I told you not to do that.
[135:44.66]I'm going to kill you now. ...
[136:08.25]I thought he was swinging.
[136:09.27]He was just preparing to swing.
[136:12.63]I fucking hate these enemies so much.
[136:15.30]These are the worst enemies in the game.
[136:17.68]In the fucking entire game.
[136:19.90]In the entire fucking game.
[136:22.68]These things suck such ass.
[136:29.05]Especially when they've got like a magician friend that you have to kill first.
[136:32.61]And they don't even know.
[136:35.03]Oh, I'm just gonna... I am...
[136:43.91]Yeah, I have a theory.
[136:45.11]You wanna hear my theory?
[136:47.79]This is the last Dark Souls they said they were gonna make.
[136:49.81]So they're probably just sitting around going, you know what, fuck it, let's make it just stupid.
[136:53.75]Let's make, like, every enemy in the game, uh, like, un-fucking-bearable.
[136:59.19]What do you think about that, Jason?
[137:01.65]You did make the trees.
[137:03.61]This is the last one we're doing, so might as well make it fucking insane.
[137:18.88]I'm gonna put on like the lightning resistance No, there's the fucking stupid pivot move
[137:53.81]He's back to fucking full health again.
[137:55.91]Oh my god, you Halloween costume fuckface.
[137:58.97]Get out of here.
[138:01.39]Your costume sucks.
[138:16.11]trying to backstab him and... God, this is so much damage.
[138:34.94]Do you have to have this much health too?
[138:46.89]Oh my god.
[138:51.85]Fucking give me a break.
[139:07.66]Just like parry spamming this guy.
[139:09.58]I don't even know why I'm fighting this dude.
[139:12.00]I don't even need to.
[139:14.32]What's going on?
[139:14.88]I'm locked in.
[139:20.81]I'm just running by literally the worst fucking enemy in this entire goddamn game.
[139:26.90]And they're everywhere too.
[139:29.90]It'd be one thing if there was like four of those guys and then like five of those guys in the whole game.
[139:33.81]They're everywhere.
[139:35.29]Oh look, there's the last boss.
[139:41.29]Georgie, son of Jordan.
[139:55.16]I wonder if Georgie, son of Jordan, is gonna have no stamina bar and just swing and fucking kill me.
[140:03.77]I am so mad right now.
[140:05.29]Like, I gotta cool it.
[140:06.43]Let's just, let's take a second.
[140:07.59]Can somebody fucking do something funny?
[140:10.57]Can I do something funny before, like, I fight this boss?
[140:12.69]Before my head explodes?
[140:18.85]Oh, that's a skip.
[140:20.37]What does that even bring me?
[140:21.09]I didn't even look.
[140:34.41]I'm gonna get a whistle, one of those old cartoon whistles, and blow on it.
[140:45.10]I know this might sound crazy, but I do want to see exactly where this is.
[140:50.88]Just burp.
[140:51.34]I don't even have to burp.
[140:53.42]I'm inconsolable right now.
[140:54.56]I have a little smoothie right here, and I drank it already.
[140:58.48]Offset again.
[141:00.25]If that smoothie had one more sip in it, maybe I would not be as mad as I am right now.
[141:08.71]Where is this?
[141:10.69]This is just, like, right to the inside of here?
[141:14.94]I just need to know exactly where this fucking is so I can just keep going back here.
[141:18.10]Because I remember these two dudes.
[141:21.48]Okay, this is the first bonfire.
[141:24.82]Back in the castle.
[141:28.79]So, okay.
[141:32.97]That's pretty significant.
[141:41.74]Let's just go see what the boss does.
[141:46.42]If you drive angry at a boss, no, you're never going to win.
[141:49.02]I don't even know what this boss does.
[141:53.38]If you drive angry at a boss, you're going to drive into a wall.
[142:07.61]Ugh.
[142:10.61]Oh, I'm still, like, I can still feel it.
[142:13.61]You know when you're mad about something and your body, your whole body shuts down?
[142:19.34]And the only thing, I'm just locked in right now.
[142:24.38]I gotta get the key and unlock my brain.
[142:28.76]Send it back.
[142:35.63]There's another way to go over here.
[142:40.65]Eat a Snickers?
[142:45.65]Eat a Snickers.
[142:47.95]I do want to kill this other dragon, though.
[142:51.42]Well, let... Okay, there's the other dragon.
[142:56.92]Let's do this.
[142:57.50]I'll level up again.
[142:58.36]Is this fall going to kill me?
[143:02.44]I hope not.
[143:06.67]This fall better not kill me.
[143:08.63]Why no amount of chocolate, peanut butter and nougat is gonna save me guys.
[143:23.72]Shit.
[143:28.75]This is spraying acid.
[143:31.01]Thank god he's attached.
[143:38.24]Stay burnt What I thought it was poison that was that was not poison God
[144:06.31]Fucking kidding me give me a fucking break oh This game this part of the get this this this like last endgame area.
[144:14.81]Whatever this is ooh Ooh, I'd not like this at all I Do not like this I do not like green eggs in him Sam I am Shove it up your ass
[144:35.37]You gonna try to feed me green rotten fucking eggs?
[144:39.37]What kind of a sicko are you?
[144:47.69]I don't even care.
[144:50.23]I'm just so toasted right now.
[144:53.06]Beware of stab, beware of lightning.
[144:54.62]Time for friendship.
[144:57.10]And I did it.
[144:57.64]Well, I didn't do it yet.
[145:04.08]Yeah, Dragonslayer Armor.
[145:07.84]Whoa.
[145:08.62]That's not... The boss is this guy, not the dragon in the sky.
[145:19.60]He's gonna, like, get on the dragon.
[145:20.94]There's a World of Warcraft boss just like this guy.
[145:42.21]He moves fast.
[146:02.33]I don't know who that is, but I'll check later.
[146:27.42]Something's happening.
[146:29.38]Something's happening.
[146:31.62]Something's happening here.
[146:34.92]There's fucking lasers.
[146:42.01]Okay, so the dragon across the map shoots a laser beam.
[146:46.83]Like a gigantic death beam.
[146:48.40]Okay.
[146:49.48]I'm gonna fucking destroy this guy now.
[146:57.76]Do your laser beam from across the map and please hit me.
[147:01.72]Please.
[147:02.56]God, hit me.
[147:05.69]Poison.
[147:06.09]I don't even know which I should be using.
[147:07.31]This guy is lightning, isn't he?
[147:13.43]Magic.
[147:14.09]You know, I'm just going to put on magic.
[147:17.25]Or dark or something.
[147:18.17]I feel like maybe I could just hurt him more.
[147:22.09]Fire.
[147:22.65]We'll just go with magic.
[147:25.25]He really wasn't that bad until I looked in the corner of my eye and saw Satan shooting a beam in my face.
[147:39.24]I saw the eye of Satan.
[147:41.83]I'm going to take the... Yeah, this will be fine.
[147:44.51]I did not send it back?
[147:45.35]I thought I did.
[147:45.91]I guess I didn't.
[147:52.47]I like all those Altoids.
[147:54.47]They do kind of look like Altoids.
[147:58.90]Oh, I'm going to go so hard on this guy right now.
[148:01.28]Can the elevator please get here?
[148:04.74]Please?
[148:05.59]Before Grandma gets over here with her stick?
[148:14.24]I'm, like, still so mad.
[148:16.54]I can't get over it.
[148:18.59]Somebody needs to, like, come over here and, like, crack!
[148:21.83]And, like, shake me and be like, Jesus, Jerry!
[148:24.43]Get a hold of yourself!
[148:25.28]Like a 30s, 1940s movie.
[148:45.26]Let's go one, two, three.
[148:48.02]This.
[148:49.91]This.
[148:51.29]Yeah, let's destroy this guy.
[148:52.83]I don't know what that is.
[149:10.37]That's a good move.
[149:27.37]Worth it.
[149:39.22]Okay, here comes a laser-beaming person.
[149:42.42]I can't really... I'm not sure how to tell where it's going to be shooting.
[149:44.56]Oh, they like to throw... What is going on with this?
[149:51.47]I didn't even know they were doing that shit.
[150:25.78]Whoa, that hit me?
[150:28.48]Oh boy!
[150:43.80]Shit, I'm not in a good spot.
[151:08.78]Don't.
[151:20.52]Damn it.
[151:21.38]Jesus.
[151:57.45]Oh, the stupid dragon.
[152:00.73]I had it there, too.
[152:05.34]I thought I could get the last hit on him before the dragon hit me with the beam, but nope.
[152:11.04]Nope.
[152:18.95]Maybe I'll try dark.
[152:19.85]I mean, he is light.
[152:23.03]I'll try dark.
[152:32.47]Oh, it's just... You know what?
[152:33.75]I'm taking an Ember too.
[152:35.91]If I had taken an Ember last time, I probably would have just killed him.
[152:41.40]That was... How many times have I tried?
[152:42.66]That was my second attempt.
[152:44.98]Hopefully I can kill him on attempt number three.
[152:48.78]Because he is not the problem.
[152:49.90]It's the random shit that the dragons do on the sides is what the real problem is.
[152:55.41]Oh, I had a sub.
[152:56.43]Who was the sub?
[152:57.05]Did I miss?
[153:04.24]I need to put... Poison lacerating.
[153:11.50]I need to buy some stuff if I don't kill him here, but I'll just put some other resin on.
[153:18.83]Because there is an opportunity for me just to kind of get comboed.
[153:32.60]let's go again again
[154:20.86]Ooh, I thought I dodged that one.
[154:22.42]Guess not.
[154:38.08]Listen to me, son.
[154:40.26]I'm your dad.
[154:42.68]Destroy him!
[154:46.14]Whoa!
[154:57.17]I listened to you.
[154:57.93]I got him.
[155:00.03]Who was it?
[155:01.47]Freex76.
[155:01.95]Freex!
[155:02.33]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[155:07.61]Thanks for giving me the strength necessary to beat that guy.
[155:14.69]Phew.
[155:16.66]Man, I got my souls back, too.
[155:19.62]Alright, so just compare.
[155:21.36]I want you to do a little comparison.
[155:24.04]Compare that guy to the guy that talks and goes on all fours and runs around screaming.
[155:32.59]That's like night and day.
[155:37.93]But no thanks to the subs, thanks to the people that did... You gave me the strength!
[155:41.09]Alright, now I can... If I died right there, then it would have been bad.
[155:54.89]But now I feel a little bit better.
[156:05.09]See, like, that boss, I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off.
[156:09.31]I knew what was going on.
[156:10.51]I knew I was losing.
[156:11.65]It wasn't, like, I was getting really mad at that last guy before this.
[156:23.62]No.
[156:23.82]No, I got a coffee here, too.
[156:33.27]I'm drinking a coffee as well.
[156:37.50]And I admit that I'm angry.
[156:42.12]That's okay.
[156:43.64]Sometimes you gotta be angry.
[156:46.88]We can't live in a world where we don't get angry sometimes.
[156:49.47]Sometimes you gotta get angry.
[156:50.79]It's good for you.
[156:51.61]As long as it doesn't happen all the time.
[156:58.49]There's lightning.
[157:00.16]And shield too.
[157:02.58]This thing is probably amazing.
[157:05.23]Scales... What does it scale with?
[157:07.84]Doesn't scale with, uh... Oh, yeah, it does.
[157:12.56]40 strength.
[157:18.74]Nope.
[157:19.32]Just gonna crush it.
[157:29.63]If Jerma can drink coffee this late, then so can I. It's decaf!
[157:33.33]It's decaf!
[157:36.45]Sorry, don't worry, it's just a decaf.
[157:37.99]30, 30, 35.
[157:46.63]And I want to buy more resin from you.
[158:06.22]Let's go with ten fire.
[158:09.91]Or I can only have five.
[158:10.81]How many in storage?
[158:13.79]I'll get two more of these.
[158:17.65]Dark.
[158:18.25]I'll get... Buy out your whole shop.
[158:21.59]How many of these do I have?
[158:25.27]Six out of ten.
[158:26.01]I could buy a couple of figies as well.
[158:35.58]So what's the difference between these?
[158:37.50]None?
[158:38.10]To just, whatever, just buy them?
[158:40.52]She only has three.
[158:41.46]I guess that's when you bring her a new flame or something, right?
[158:44.76]Have a new ash.
[158:45.90]She'll do it.
[158:46.30]Okay.
[158:49.12]Oh, where is it?
[159:10.24]Jerma endorsed coffee at late night.
[159:11.96]Spread the word.
[159:12.64]Let's go back to having fun.
[159:20.96]What's he doing up here?
[159:24.98]Um... What am I doing right now?
[159:29.58]I need to go back to... Where am I going?
[159:39.69]Hold on.
[159:42.24]I think I'm in the wrong thing.
[159:43.24]Yeah, it's right there.
[159:46.89]I know.
[159:47.13]I did want to do this, though.
[159:58.11]Where?
[160:00.11]I wanted to go back.
[160:00.81]I'm going to look over here for a second.
[160:08.19]Hold on.
[160:18.89]Where's the ladder?
[160:19.75]What bonfire is the ladder?
[160:27.54]Isn't it like... Where was the dancer?
[160:37.48]Because I wanted to climb... Where is that fucking ladder?
[160:41.78]Here it is.
[160:50.51]I hate that I have work tomorrow.
[160:52.61]Don't have a day off until next Saturday.
[160:54.70]What?
[160:57.58]Next Saturday?
[161:03.72]Jeremy, you're kind of slow on your run.
[161:04.96]Star has already beaten this two or three times.
[161:07.24]Well, Star has also played this game probably two or three times longer than I have.
[161:11.25]So, there's your answer.
[161:14.01]I want to go over here.
[161:17.85]I haven't played this game for two days and I'm taking it slow because that's just how I play these games.
[161:27.14]But I wanted to go fight this guy again.
[161:38.84]Just out of curiosity.
[161:49.35]You want to hear a fun fact?
[161:50.37]I don't think I have a good fun fact for you guys.
[161:56.13]That guy's not in squad.
[162:19.23]That's not fun.
[162:19.93]Were you guys not doing fun facts?
[162:24.17]These are not fun facts?
[162:25.31]What do you mean fun facts?
[162:27.43]Okay.
[162:41.90]Let's give this a try with some dark.
[162:50.75]Nope, dodged that too late.
[163:05.99]Alright, nope, I'll get it.
[163:28.00]Dear Lord.
[163:28.46]Rastafari had a
[164:22.06]Oh, come on.
[164:38.75]Get some stamina.
[165:32.76]Up in a tree!
[165:49.71]Get the fuck out of town!
[165:53.17]Ugh!
[166:06.06]That's fucking impossible.
[166:07.14]I don't understand.
[166:09.28]Games like this, what am I supposed to even do?
[166:12.56]What am I supposed to fight this guy?
[166:14.20]Games are fucking so hard.
[166:15.76]Games suck and shit.
[166:28.63]Brought to you by Jerma.
[166:31.42]An hour and 45 minutes ago.
[166:42.22]I had to beat that guy.
[166:43.52]Wasn't gonna let him beat me.
[166:50.79]What's behind here?
[166:52.89]All I needed was to warm up.
[166:54.43]Yeah, that has probably something to do with it too, but I was just being a complainer earlier.
[166:58.95]The game crashed.
[167:00.59]What happened to my controller?
[167:08.24]GalacticWarrior125.
[167:09.04]Uh...
[167:12.75]I hope there's no enemy right here.
[167:14.24]Hold on, I got my mouse and keyboard for a second.
[167:19.00]My controller just crashed.
[167:21.72]Hold on.
[167:27.33]What's the rest of Bonfire?
[167:28.77]E?
[167:28.91]Alright, let me look at this.
[167:32.91]There was at least a couple of subscribers that I definitely missed.
[167:35.42]Let me see who they were.
[167:42.46]I know that guy.
[167:43.22]I missed that guy for sure.
[167:51.43]Beat the game like this?
[167:52.55]Mouse and keyboard?
[167:54.59]That's not going to happen.
[167:59.85]Okay, so I see my list here.
[168:07.27]GalacticWarrior125, RastaBananaMan, Freex, BeefyWeefy, Glorelis, NotSausage, Pipsteer.
[168:15.21]I guess I didn't.
[168:15.73]Who is my resubs?
[168:17.65]Still not showing up.
[168:21.08]Yeah, resubs are not showing up for me.
[168:23.14]For some weird reason.
[168:24.26]But for those of you that resubbed during that fight or the last fight, thanks a lot.
[168:28.08]I appreciate it.
[168:32.72]All I had to do was come back from eating fucking bacon and eggs.
[168:38.60]Oh, God.
[168:41.99]Oh, no.
[168:43.85]No, don't crash the game.
[168:47.89]I think we're okay.
[168:48.81]Yeah, we're good.
[169:05.78]It's so funny.
[169:08.10]I'm just thinking of the mindset I was in during that fight and the mindset I was in right at the beginning of the stream.
[169:14.53]It's all mental.
[169:16.39]Guys, I need to get a close-up for this one.
[169:19.53]Take it from me.
[169:26.85]It's all mental.
[169:29.22]See, I went into that fight the first time already upset, not concentrating, not just playing the game.
[169:39.07]And as you see, it didn't work out so well.
[169:42.77]But when you actually concentrate, when you leave all your bullshit at the door, things work out just fine.
[169:51.07]You see?
[169:52.33]Now that's going to happen again.
[169:53.87]I can guarantee you.
[169:55.71]And when it happens, I want you guys to really remind me.
[170:00.85]It's all in your head.
[170:03.97]You fucking wuss.
[170:05.89]And I'll go, oh yeah, that's right.
[170:14.49]So next time I complain, I go, this guy's fucking stupid.
[170:17.35]He said that move, oh wow, he's a 360 degree turn, impossible.
[170:20.85]I want you guys to say, just stop being a fucking wuss.
[170:24.65]And I'll look at it and I'll remember what I said right here.
[170:28.85]I'll remember this day.
[170:34.31]Just don't FailFish.
[170:38.05]Let's get this to 40.
[170:44.58]Let's cap this off.
[170:47.96]Alright, I have two directions I can go.
[170:51.96]I can go past that guy.
[170:53.60]I'll go past that guy.
[171:10.20]We have to remind you to never take the hat off.
[171:15.59]No, the hat... It looked cool.
[171:17.23]It looked cool, guy.
[171:18.27]Looked cool.
[171:22.95]But there is something down here.
[171:24.59]So I'm just going to continue going this way.
[171:28.63]Who knows what's down here?
[171:29.81]Oh, could this be a message?
[171:34.40]Oh, shit.
[171:36.22]Oh, he's bleeding still.
[171:39.24]Blood is still coming out of this guy.
[171:42.65]Kind of gross.
[171:45.15]Are these... One of these are going to stand up, right?
[171:48.45]You have to figure.
[171:53.22]Yeah, there's one alive.
[172:01.84]Oh, look at his neck!
[172:06.13]Oh!
[172:09.05]These enemies are awesome.
[172:11.41]Aren't these in Dark Souls 1?
[172:22.95]Path of the Dragon.
[172:23.81]Titanite Scale.
[172:34.70]I have so many of these and I haven't been able to spend one of them.
[172:53.00]Titanite scale, another one.
[172:55.58]May the flames guide thee ahead.
[172:57.46]Okay.
[173:01.00]What about over here?
[173:12.65]You know, enough.
[173:14.97]Enough of that.
[173:21.55]Cool.
[173:24.01]Bonfire?
[173:26.77]Why is there a bonfire behind an illusory wall?
[173:30.49]Untended graves?
[173:36.41]Okay.
[173:43.21]30,000 souls.
[173:44.07]I might need to be careful here.
[173:48.11]Shriveling stone.
[173:49.27]Shriveling stone.
[173:53.69]Isn't this the very beginning of the game?
[173:58.39]Yeah, this is just like a dark, scary version of the beginning of the game.
[174:02.23]Shit.
[174:08.93]Those guys are all going to sprout wings.
[174:11.39]At least another bonfire is right there and I can sprint to it if I need to.
[174:24.99]Come on, one at a time.
[174:25.93]Another one.
[174:35.07]What do you got?
[174:42.72]Shriving Stone.
[174:49.98]Ashen Estus Ring.
[174:56.33]Increases FP restored via Ashen.
[175:00.87]You know, I just wish there were more rings that weren't spell stuff.
[175:04.39]I mean, it's cool, but... Why can't there be... Like, you deal 25% more damage.
[175:12.65]But you take 25% less health.
[175:18.06]35% damage reduction.
[175:20.72]But the downside... You run slower.
[175:24.60]I'm your dad!
[175:27.03]Destroy him!
[175:30.45]Whoa!
[175:31.41]Dr. Stum Puppet?
[175:33.75]Dr. Strum Puppet.
[175:35.31]The Puppet Doctor.
[175:36.03]I'm going to call you Puppet Doctor because it's easier for me.
[175:40.12]Welcome, thanks.
[175:43.02]Welcome to the family.
[175:43.80]I had a family.
[175:47.06]I had a lot of health.
[175:47.72]He's behind me now, too.
[175:48.86]He has a dog in front of me.
[176:02.52]Clowns to the left of me.
[176:04.10]Jokers to the right.
[176:05.30]Here I am stuck in the middle with you.
[176:09.57]Stuck in the middle with you.
[176:11.05]Is that the song?
[176:11.69]That's not how the song goes.
[176:17.31]Wait, is that... Is that how the song goes?
[176:22.55]I don't know.
[176:27.83]St...
[176:31.87]Ooh, dogs!
[176:35.12]Dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs!
[176:38.70]Go, go, go, go, go!
[176:51.31]Alright, I think I'm done with the cartoon noises.
[176:59.31]Copyright?
[176:59.95]Uh-oh.
[177:01.15]That's right.
[177:01.89]That is copyright.
[177:04.82]Okay, you dogs really are a pain in my ass.
[177:08.62]Don't get wedged.
[177:12.72]I'm wedged in the corner.
[177:13.68]I'm gonna sneeze, too.
[177:16.09]Oh, shit.
[177:24.50]I'm gonna sneeze again.
[177:26.36]Come on.
[177:27.48]Don't sneeze again.
[177:28.40]She's really messing the game up for me.
[177:34.05]Hold on.
[177:37.97]It's not gonna happen.
[177:40.31]It will eventually, but not right now.
[177:45.19]Ugh.
[177:49.74]I want to go back.
[177:52.10]I kind of want to see what's the whole point of this illusion area.
[178:09.26]Boo.
[178:13.28]Whoa.
[178:14.12]Whoa.
[178:16.16]Whoa.
[178:16.88]They're coming this way.
[178:17.70]They're fast.
[178:21.38]One at a time, please.
[178:24.20]One at a time, please.
[178:32.28]Oh.
[178:46.81]Oh!
[178:48.15]What?
[178:49.07]What?
[178:50.25]What?
[178:51.33]What?
[178:52.25]He went around and dropped down.
[178:55.23]He went around and dropped down on me.
[179:08.60]What is this area?
[179:09.62]This area doesn't make any sense.
[179:14.97]Oh, fucking shit.
[179:16.45]No.
[179:16.71]You know, that's, uh... That's what we call something extremely difficult to deal with.
[179:32.20]You know those crystal lizards?
[179:33.52]Well, go ahead.
[179:33.94]Here, fight two of them.
[179:36.85]You don't want to fight two crystal lizards?
[179:39.17]Why not?
[179:40.51]Why not, Jerry?
[179:42.95]Jerry, you're going to fight two of those at the same time.
[179:56.87]Where was that?
[179:57.47]I seriously don't remember where the fuck that was.
[180:01.10]Oh, I am getting mad again.
[180:02.60]Don't be such a wuss.
[180:03.34]As if it was this way.
[180:04.72]Alright.
[180:05.70]Who's hit... Somebody hit the dog.
[180:08.08]I'm gonna lose 30,000 souls.
[180:09.06]Yeah, I am.
[180:10.78]I have to just... I'm in waist-high water, so I can't fucking move.
[180:16.27]Waist-high water.
[180:17.47]Can't move in waist-high water.
[180:19.71]Good.
[180:20.59]Great game mechanic.
[180:21.35]Yes!
[180:24.97]Ollie the Peace, thanks for subbing because that's uh... Right now, I am... What a stupid thing.
[180:35.42]What a dumb shit.
[180:41.60]Can I put on like a Mario costume to be able to move in water?
[180:44.50]I don't even know what's... What is this for?
[180:50.99]Illusory wolf.
[180:52.33]Okay, what's at the end?
[180:53.65]A mimic chest?
[180:57.24]Can't wait to get to the end of this whole stupid thing to get to a mimic chest.
[181:00.08]And then die to the mimic chest.
[181:02.58]That's gonna be swell.
[181:10.37]This area is huge.
[181:15.99]What the fuck?
[181:18.89]This area is gigantic.
[181:21.77]I just... Okay, I... I do have to fight this guy again?
[181:30.81]I have to fight the Gunder guy again?
[181:38.84]What is this?
[181:39.34]Did I restart the game?
[181:40.76]Okay.
[181:49.73]I'll fight this guy again.
[181:50.61]He does like a new move.
[182:00.97]I am really confused right now.
[182:10.98]Alright, let me just like fight this guy.
[182:24.89]He has more moves.
[182:25.59]This is a different boss.
[182:33.17]Oh, that's new.
[182:45.65]What is this?
[183:07.57]have that thing pop out of him.
[183:10.13]He's just like this guy.
[183:11.13]Oh, he hit me with the tip.
[183:27.02]He doesn't change.
[183:48.37]Oh boy.
[183:48.83]Hopefully I can kill him.
[183:50.87]Oh, I thought he was doing something.
[183:51.89]It was transforming.
[183:55.93]Okay, I beat him.
[184:00.65]That was a boss.
[184:01.26]60,000 souls for that?
[184:17.90]Why was there a boss down?
[184:20.18]I'm... I've never done this before.
[184:21.32]I'm scratching my head.
[184:24.06]Scratching my head.
[184:26.06]Because... This must just be one of these secret areas.
[184:32.78]Okay.
[184:35.42]Black Knight Glaive.
[184:44.07]Cool, I killed the secret boss.
[184:51.16]D and D. Let's see what it looks like.
[185:02.06]Does it do the spin move?
[185:03.05]Listen to me, son.
[185:06.13]I'm your dad.
[185:08.55]Destroy him!
[185:12.55]Hold on.
[185:14.42]Eudix Gunder, that's... He's... Do you guys get the joke?
[185:18.06]That's a good joke.
[185:20.35]He's talking, not talking about me.
[185:22.76]He wants Champion Gunder to kill me because that's his son.
[185:31.30]That was a good one.
[185:31.94]Thanks for subbing though.
[185:33.66]Appreciate it.
[185:34.30]I can open that door.
[185:35.08]I actually used that in the last game.
[185:41.17]I think I missed another sub too.
[185:45.63]Maybe not.
[185:47.77]I'll have to check in a minute.
[185:49.80]Sorry when I miss subscribers or miss that people resubbed or something.
[185:53.70]It's just as hard to take my eyes off the screen when a boss is, you know, can one-hit kill me.
[186:01.75]There's more to this place.
[186:08.17]Am I gonna go back up to the very, very, like, the tutorial?
[186:15.63]You know what I mean?
[186:16.41]This is... I'm in Alice in Wonderland world right now.
[186:27.66]Oh, he can't be... He can't be staggered.
[186:32.02]Hey, Kim.
[186:33.34]Listen to me, son!
[186:35.80]I'm your dad!
[186:38.24]Destroy him!
[186:41.66]Whoa!
[186:42.06]Screwzy!
[186:44.61]Thanks for seven.
[186:47.04]Oh, I just realized something very important.
[186:48.96]I have a lot of souls right now that I don't want to lose.
[187:02.93]He's still alive.
[187:04.35]How can you be still alive?
[187:16.51]Okay, now I'm going to go back.
[187:20.71]Screwsie.
[187:25.63]Did I ever explain why I don't have donations?
[187:29.21]I think a couple times.
[187:34.42]I'll do it again, though.
[187:36.36]Because I don't want to take just random donations from people because I don't... Here's the thing, right?
[187:44.74]I don't know how old you guys are,
[187:47.42]I don't know what your financial situations are.
[187:51.26]I don't know if it's real, because there's obviously chargebacks and stuff like that.
[187:56.90]That's not 100% of the reason why, but that's in the back of my brain.
[188:01.89]And I think about it.
[188:03.93]If I'm walking down... Let's say I go to PAX.
[188:05.59]I go to PAX this coming weekend, right?
[188:07.49]PAX East is this next weekend.
[188:10.01]And I... Stumble across a fan, or somebody that likes the channel, or whatever.
[188:15.01]And they reach in their pocket.
[188:16.87]And they... We talk for a second.
[188:18.33]Yeah, hey, what's going on, man?
[188:19.07]Yeah, because I like to chat with people.
[188:20.37]If somebody ever flags me down at PAX, I talk.
[188:22.27]We, you know, at least hang out for a few minutes.
[188:25.43]If that person reached in their pocket and pulled a $20 bill out and handed it to me... I'd be like... What are you doing?
[188:32.44]No, hey, take this $20.
[188:34.67]I'd be like, no, I... I don't... I don't... It's alright, dude.
[188:38.15]Like, I wouldn't, like... I think about it in real life.
[188:41.05]If some dude, like, handed me a $50 bill in real life, I would be like, huh?
[188:44.71]I don't... You can hold on to this.
[188:49.53]This is an odd feeling.
[188:50.91]I'd totally do that.
[189:01.38]I just wouldn't accept it.
[189:02.36]It would...
[189:04.18]It would feel very off.
[189:06.40]So, anonymous is a little different, but even anonymous, it's like it's somebody just handing me... Like, because I don't know how much money people would give.
[189:16.02]You open up the floodgates there, because what if somebody just gives you, like, fucking 500 bucks?
[189:22.03]It's like, oh dear.
[189:24.35]Uh, you don't even know what to do about that.
[189:27.33]Like, I don't know, what the fuck would I even do?
[189:31.15]Because then it's like, what if you don't read his message?
[189:33.91]What if you... You know, you read over a donation or something.
[189:38.45]Or somebody gives you like a hundred bucks versus five hundred bucks.
[189:42.15]And it's like, oh, do you like the guy that gave you more money?
[189:44.11]I'm going to have to give him more money.
[189:46.48]I don't know.
[189:47.18]I'd rather just be... There's five dollars.
[189:50.34]You can just click that button.
[189:52.44]And it just reoccurs every month unless you want to cancel it.
[189:57.36]And that's how I'm the most comfortable...
[189:59.73]is it's like directly through Twitch.
[190:02.29]It's only five bucks.
[190:04.84]And it's not something that I'm, I'm... nervous of taking some random person's money.
[190:15.53]And don't get me wrong.
[190:16.41]Don't get me wrong, it's not like, oh yeah, I don't know.
[190:19.55]Who doesn't like, who doesn't like money?
[190:21.19]Who doesn't like five dollars?
[190:22.45]Who doesn't like a hundred dollars?
[190:25.51]But morally, in my brain, I don't want to receive, like, just take money from random people.
[190:31.84]That is over, like, $5, $10, $20, $30.
[190:34.86]You know what I mean?
[190:37.14]It gets flakey for me.
[190:44.33]Kroden.
[190:45.01]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[190:47.13]Appreciate it.
[190:51.20]It feels different though, like if I have no trouble subbing, but yeah, if I handed you cash at GXL, that would be really awkward.
[190:57.10]I get, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[191:01.76]We said, like, let me just stumble over some more words before.
[191:06.22]Leatherjacket, I'll give you a little quick story.
[191:07.72]Leatherjacket is a guy that, you notice he's a mod.
[191:11.30]I met him at GXL.
[191:14.27]There's a big TF2 tournament.
[191:15.55]It was a really great time hanging out.
[191:17.35]I went with Star and all, like, some other, like, Truck Truck was there, like, Mayla was there, like, all TF2 people.
[191:22.63]I remember just hanging out.
[191:23.41]It was, like, one of the first times I ever met those guys, really, in real life.
[191:26.93]But we just hung out.
[191:30.20]We just talked.
[191:31.76]I played Smash Brothers.
[191:32.96]Like, we were just chilling.
[191:34.76]If you had reached in your pocket leather jacket and gave me 50 bucks...
[191:41.56]I don't even know... I would... It would be hard for us to continue speaking.
[191:47.58]It just... It would.
[191:51.41]Ooh.
[191:55.37]Increases all those things, but you take more damage.
[191:57.85]Is that worth it?
[192:10.63]No, it was a great time.
[192:12.83]So, I don't see the point of this ring.
[192:16.22]I guess, okay, if you're increasing vigor and vitality and endurance, you're already increasing your health, but you take more damage, so isn't that kind of negating the whole reason you put the ring on?
[192:28.44]This is like, yeah, this is what I was just saying, though.
[192:31.26]It's too bad it's not like strength and dex, because I probably would use it.
[192:34.98]I feel like my HP is not a problem at the moment.
[192:44.73]Oh, he's the Moonlit Sword.
[192:46.37]That's in every single Souls game.
[192:50.11]I used this on my last Bloodborne playthrough.
[192:52.27]It was pretty fun.
[192:57.15]No, I think we're just going to crush these.
[192:58.73]I already have the stuff I'm working on, the weapon I'm using.
[193:08.11]This is going to take me to endgame.
[193:10.18]I'm already pretty much at endgame, I think.
[193:13.06]Just crush them.
[193:17.47]It's almost like, hey, we're pals, right?
[193:19.19]Here's 50 bucks to say so.
[193:21.93]Yeah, because then you could get into the... You know, like, favoritism and stuff.
[193:26.89]You have to start treating people potentially differently.
[193:29.89]Because the... Okay, I have the subscribers.
[193:32.69]And then I have people that donated, like, 50 bucks.
[193:35.43]It's like... If you don't read all their messages and you don't, like, respond to them... Maybe that person would get annoyed and upset that... Man, I gave this motherfucker 50 bucks and he's, like, just skipping over all my chat messages.
[193:45.70]It's just...
[193:47.21]I don't know.
[193:47.57]It's a lot that I think about.
[193:50.07]And I'd rather just leave it to subscriptions because everyone gets to stay on the same playing field.
[193:57.43]Right?
[193:58.49]Every single person that subscribes to this channel all paid $5.
[194:02.63]There's not like a super subscription where you can pay like fucking $100.
[194:06.66]You know what I mean?
[194:16.22]not just a random guy in the street giving you money it's a guy who watches you and finds pleasure in it and gives you money that's true but even like close friends of mine good really good close friends of mine same situation if they just were like hey yeah so we're really like good buddies and we like hanging out all the time here's a hundred bucks I'd be like put that up you don't have to do that wasn't it put it up put
[194:50.88]Alright, I'm good to go.
[194:52.82]Actually, I think I can get one more.
[194:56.78]Maybe one more?
[194:57.84]Come on, give me 10,000.
[194:58.40]Yes!
[195:05.42]That one guy paid, like, 20 bucks.
[195:07.09]Like, if you sub multiple times, like, that's up to you.
[195:11.31]But it's enough of a, I guess, a thing in the way that... Yeah, there are a few, like, Ranger, like Red Ranger, for instance, has, like, eight accounts subscribed to this channel.
[195:23.72]So, yeah, is he kind of doing a workaround?
[195:25.94]Sure.
[195:26.16]Sure.
[195:28.36]But I just, I don't know, something about donations.
[195:32.78]I'd rather keep it official on Twitch through like the five bucks.
[195:44.01]So let's keep moving.
[195:54.00]You can't buy friendship, but you can buy a subscription on Twitch.
[195:57.77]Yes, you can.
[196:03.61]And you see a lot of people, and I'm not going to, you know, say that what they're doing is wrong.
[196:09.24]I'm not going to say what they're doing is hard to do, but it probably is.
[196:13.74]Like, people do, like, the levels of, like, certain donations and certain subscribers, get, like, extra perks, and here's my Snapchat, and here's, like, the official Discord.
[196:24.30]Honest to God, guys, that's something I don't want to fucking have to deal with.
[196:27.33]I don't want to have to manage that.
[196:29.35]It's like, people ask me why I don't do a Patreon.
[196:32.43]Uh, because I don't feel like managing, like, extra stuff besides YouTube and Twitch.
[196:37.68]Because at that point, it's like, oh, do, like, the super level.
[196:41.03]If you give me $500 on Patreon, I'll give you a personal message every fucking two weeks.
[196:47.17]It's like, I don't want to do that.
[196:47.97]You know, that's like, that's something more to think about.
[196:52.06]And if you don't do it, if you miss it, if I fucking don't do that, then I'm an asshole.
[196:58.14]Like, I'd rather just be an asshole on my own terms, like, to me, than potentially fucking be an asshole to somebody else.
[197:06.91]I hope all this is making any sense.
[197:18.50]I like to keep things as simple as possible.
[197:24.90]Come on.
[197:25.99]I can't really reliably get behind you right now.
[197:28.79]What was that?
[197:31.77]What was that?
[197:32.35]I hit the right... I punched the rock.
[197:36.87]Patreon and sub stuff.
[197:39.50]I don't know.
[197:42.10]You fall and you kind of go down a rabbit hole, in my opinion, when you do stuff like that.
[197:47.15]And look, some people have the work ethic.
[197:48.86]Some people can do it.
[197:50.02]Some people can manage a hundred damn things at the same time.
[197:54.34]I can't.
[197:55.58]And I admit that.
[197:56.52]I admit that I can't fucking do that.
[197:59.43]So I'm not going to pretend I can for the sake of more money.
[198:15.56]I thought I could transition that pretty well.
[198:27.55]Come on.
[198:39.68]Hornet ring.
[198:42.69]What you do is you do it because you like it, you love it, or you don't want to get tangled up in the complex avenues of monetizing yourself.
[198:51.00]Ooh.
[198:55.86]Ooh.
[198:56.98]I could put both these on.
[199:00.24]I have to... I have to take a look at that in a minute here.
[199:04.83]Yeah, I mean, look.
[199:06.15]I'm going to be completely honest with you guys.
[199:09.37]I make money doing this.
[199:12.18]YouTube, Twitch, like, I make money.
[199:17.03]And it's not... It's not a huge, like, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but is there a boss in here, too?
[199:28.97]What the hell is this?
[199:32.16]Am I in, like, the real world right now?
[199:34.34]Did I unplug from the Matrix?
[199:35.60]Because nobody's in here.
[199:36.50]And this is the shrine.
[199:42.02]Finishing up that point there is... I already am monetized.
[199:49.57]I already am monetized.
[199:52.31]To a point where... I don't know.
[199:54.47]I just don't feel like I'm comfortable or need to take sponsorships or do donation stuff for...
[200:06.28]I've only ever done one sponsored video.
[200:08.40]Ever.
[200:09.44]Ever.
[200:10.56]In the five years I've done YouTube.
[200:14.09]And I told myself I was never going to do it again.
[200:16.39]It was just about four and a half years ago.
[200:19.89]Blacksmith hammer?
[200:20.61]Is everybody dead?
[200:21.15]Hopefully I didn't take this from him.
[200:25.62]This thing's kind of cool.
[200:35.96]Seems familiar.
[200:36.62]Yeah, it does.
[200:40.50]You're still here?
[200:41.22]Alright, I need to listen to this.
[200:43.39]What are you doing here?
[200:43.97]You have new items.
[200:44.39]Priestess ring?
[201:08.07]I can buy Homeward Bones?
[201:11.45]Fuck man, I'll take like five.
[201:20.81]If I kill her here, will she be gone in real life?
[201:26.76]Man, I gotta be getting pretty close to the end of the game.
[201:28.26]Should I kill her?
[201:29.96]And then I can... It was all a dream, right?
[201:34.88]The Dark Cube sponsorship.
[201:36.16]What's in here?
[201:37.52]Coiled sword fragment?
[201:41.73]That's not a weapon, is it?
[201:56.10]What the hell was that?
[201:59.94]Return to last bonfire arrested at or to shrine.
[202:04.60]Fragment of the coiled sword of bone.
[202:05.82]Returns caster to last bonfire are used for resting.
[202:10.85]What?
[202:15.19]So this is just an infinite homeward bone?
[202:20.83]Okay.
[202:26.94]I guess I just bought those homeward bones for no reason.
[202:37.51]You and I share a very similar opinion.
[202:45.23]Very similar opinion.
[202:48.09]I think YouTube and Twitch has been transformed into just guys and gals just making bucks.
[203:00.32]And it's something that I resent very much so.
[203:05.32]People ask me, you know, if we're going to continue our real talk here.
[203:10.25]How come you don't make like a video every fucking day?
[203:12.39]Where's like the videos?
[203:13.43]I want more videos, videos.
[203:14.61]And it's like, well, I want to upload something I like, something that I care about, something that I think was interesting or something that I want to say, something I had to talk about or something I felt like doing.
[203:28.76]I don't want... It's... I don't care to, like, half... I almost just fell to my death.
[203:35.45]Because I don't think there's anything there.
[203:40.05]Oh, there is something here.
[203:42.13]More ashes?
[203:42.73]Okay.
[203:42.97]Okay.
[203:48.56]And when I say I don't care, it's not I don't care about making videos.
[203:51.23]That's not what I want you to get out of this.
[203:54.33]It's that I want making videos to be something I want to do, not something I need to do.
[204:02.57]And I feel like a lot of people on these various websites do it because they need to, not because they want to.
[204:10.43]Whether it's from a fame or popularity standpoint, or a monetary standpoint,
[204:19.85]I need to do this.
[204:21.01]I need to.
[204:22.43]Versus, I want to do this today.
[204:27.83]I think there's nothing else for me to do here.
[204:29.35]I think I can leave.
[204:31.35]But, interesting.
[204:35.66]Now, is that to the detriment of how much money I make?
[204:37.54]Sure it is.
[204:41.88]Ooh.
[204:45.04]Even more.
[204:49.47]But like I said, I'm doing just fine.
[204:52.99]What the hell are those?
[205:00.15]Getting a lot of odd items.
[205:08.23]Looks like an eyeball.
[205:12.71]Where the hell are they?
[205:20.44]There it is.
[205:21.16]Reveals horrors to the sightless firekeeper?
[205:23.40]A pair of dark eyes said to be the eyes of the first firekeeper in the light that was lost by the... It reveals to the sightless firekeepers things that they should never see.
[205:33.63]What?
[205:40.31]Am I about to go freak out the lady at the other bonfire?
[205:44.03]The real one?
[205:49.48]Alright, well, I'm going back.
[205:57.37]Why is the shrine trashed?
[205:59.71]It's just like a dream world, don't worry.
[206:01.69]It's just a dream world.
[206:04.34]How did I get in here?
[206:07.48]I don't remember how I got in here.
[206:08.64]Over here?
[206:17.73]I make vids because I want to.
[206:18.75]200 plus vids and I'm still 107 subs.
[206:22.61]Yeah, man.
[206:23.37]That's the reason why I didn't start doing YouTube or streaming for some ulterior motive.
[206:28.73]I was just like, yeah, I'm just going to do that today.
[206:33.13]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[206:37.25]Ster.
[206:38.83]Is he even watching right now?
[206:40.09]Is he here watching this?
[206:42.15]I believe he shares a similar opinion.
[206:46.73]Well, thanks, Star.
[206:49.61]Only two months?
[206:50.51]Wow.
[206:50.81]I was subbed to you for like six months straight.
[206:54.35]Wow.
[206:56.23]No, I'm kidding.
[207:02.87]Fuck you.
[207:10.73]Hey, did you even find this?
[207:11.95]Did you even find this super secret area?
[207:16.81]I bet Star didn't even know about this super secret area.
[207:26.63]So if I show this to her, what's she going to do?
[207:28.47]She's not going to lose her mind, is she?
[207:31.11]Should I do this?
[207:35.41]Okay, I'm going to give it to her.
[207:36.31]It said it was going to make her day horrible.
[207:42.03]Okay, I don't know what this does.
[207:45.57]Are they her eyes?
[207:48.99]Shit, it is her eyes.
[207:50.11]Hmm.
[207:51.27]Okay.
[207:51.85]I don't know what that does.
[207:52.95]I got ashes to give to her.
[207:54.09]Okay.
[208:19.00]Now, what does she sell?
[208:22.54]Poison darts.
[208:27.70]Oh, what's he got?
[208:29.25]Come here.
[208:31.05]Come here, boy.
[208:31.51]I actually kind of like that.
[208:45.48]Alright, whatever.
[208:48.54]Okay, okay.
[208:50.74]That's me, Bobo the Bear.
[208:51.88]Yeah, okay.
[208:52.90]Alright.
[208:54.34]Oh, okay.
[208:58.02]General.
[209:01.96]Twinkling.
[209:02.62]Twinkling.
[209:03.08]Twighton.
[209:04.00]Twinkling.
[209:06.96]Be careful.
[209:07.76]Oh, yeah, sure.
[209:09.18]I will.
[209:09.66]I'll be careful.
[209:12.76]Well, thank you for the heads up.
[209:13.68]I appreciate it.
[209:16.69]Gonzo, can I ask you a personal question?
[209:20.43]Where'd you get these?
[209:27.02]Where... I killed like every boss in this area.
[209:30.58]Besides like one, apparently.
[209:36.06]Dragon... Oh, okay.
[209:37.12]Dragonslayer.
[209:42.51]Talk to the keeper?
[209:43.09]I just did.
[209:44.97]She has something else to tell me?
[209:47.86]That's my weapon on the screen.
[209:51.82]I'll go talk to her.
[209:52.74]I already did.
[209:53.90]Maybe she has something else to say.
[209:55.31]Sounds like Lois is dead.
[210:03.08]Carl Pewterschmidt.
[210:04.84]Yeah, Bobo the Bear and Carl Pewterschmidt do sound alike.
[210:10.60]Welcome home, Ashespeak.
[210:12.72]Ashen One, my thanks for the eyes thou hast given.
[210:16.38]But fire keepers are not meant to have eyes.
[210:19.74]It is forbidden.
[210:21.06]These will reveal through a sliver of light, frightful images of betrayal.
[210:26.36]A world without fire.
[210:28.18]Ashen One, is this truly thy wish?
[210:34.76]No, I don't know.
[210:35.48]Not sure.
[210:37.40]Hmm.
[210:40.26]Wish for a world without flame, or should I decline?
[210:45.32]I think I might wish for a world without flame.
[210:48.80]Kind of want to do that.
[210:51.10]Okay.
[211:02.98]Okay.
[211:03.24]Okay.
[211:03.52]Blacksmith, blacksmith, blacksmith.
[211:06.34]I have something to tell you.
[211:07.46]What?
[211:07.66]I can't even tell him.
[211:32.23]Okay, bye.
[211:33.73]I'm still doing that.
[211:35.23]That's over.
[211:38.64]This will be our private affair.
[211:44.10]The Age of Darkness.
[211:45.34]That's in Dark Souls 1 or Dark Souls 2, right?
[211:49.22]Isn't that supposed to be the Age of Humanity?
[211:50.90]I'm sick of these gods.
[211:58.00]I'm sick of all these gods.
[211:58.94]We're gonna break up the banks.
[212:02.30]We're gonna go to Wall Street.
[212:03.58]We're gonna take out the banks.
[212:06.22]All these gods, all these big gods in their big houses.
[212:10.62]We're gonna bring in, usher in a new age of humanity.
[212:13.30]Where am I going?
[212:28.08]Is this the right way?
[212:38.58]Jerry's getting political.
[212:48.85]I guess this is the final encounter.
[212:53.71]Get ready.
[212:56.45]How's my Michael Caine impression going?
[212:58.55]I can't do Michael Caine.
[213:12.41]What do we got here?
[213:14.75]Okay.
[213:15.23]Grand Archives Key and Got Hard.
[213:18.15]Twin Swords.
[213:20.45]Well, not hard enough, apparently.
[213:29.67]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[213:34.63]Falenjo or Falenjo.
[213:36.43]Falenjo 5.
[213:38.17]Welcome.
[213:38.61]Thank you.
[213:40.34]I'll go back.
[213:41.80]You haven't already subscribed.
[213:42.72]Attraction doesn't work.
[213:49.17]This looks like the skip for this area.
[213:51.29]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[213:58.29]Okay, is there not hard enough?
[213:59.59]I feel like that's important.
[214:02.65]Templates.
[214:03.60]Like, not hard enough.
[214:11.88]Techniques, actions... Where's not?
[214:21.45]Comfort, guts, composure, recklessness... Come on, where's not?
[214:29.51]Musings?
[214:32.41]Not here.
[214:33.29]Damn it!
[214:39.02]Stay calm... No...
[214:45.08]Come on, really?
[215:01.23]Fine.
[215:02.77]Sleep talk?
[215:09.76]Sadness, loyalty, hope.
[215:17.00]I wish there was a... Not hard.
[215:22.61]I don't think hard is even here.
[215:23.85]The real fight begins.
[215:35.42]Give it up.
[215:36.82]Yeah, alright.
[215:37.80]Give it up is going right here.
[215:40.40]You know what?
[215:40.74]Just give it up.
[215:49.35]Yeah.
[215:50.01]Give it up.
[215:54.16]No.
[215:57.60]Try give it up.
[215:59.00]No.
[216:00.40]If only I had a give it up.
[216:08.79]Let there be give it up.
[216:14.01]You're not going to do it.
[216:21.06]Give it up.
[216:21.52]Required ahead.
[216:22.50]Beware.
[216:22.82]Try give it up.
[216:25.32]These are fun.
[216:38.59]Give it up.
[216:43.25]Wait, I already fought her.
[216:44.07]Well, alright.
[216:54.34]Do I really have to fight you again?
[216:55.40]Ah, French champagne.
[217:00.04]Did you just teleport around this whole area for no reason?
[217:05.24]On the stairs.
[217:07.28]Where are you going?
[217:12.97]Game sucks.
[217:13.71]Yeah, there should be a game sucks option.
[217:26.08]Game sucks.
[217:29.06]Did we already talk about how I love that term?
[217:32.30]It's so vague.
[217:34.27]It's so undescript.
[217:36.85]It gets the point across.
[217:48.84]Oh.
[217:51.62]No.
[217:52.68]No.
[218:02.82]Get lost in the library.
[218:06.50]Yeah, be wary of ambush.
[218:18.11]Soul of a crestfallen knight.
[218:21.61]I do like the library, though.
[218:23.47]At least it's not a swamp.
[218:25.87]Remember.
[218:27.47]Look at all these books.
[218:33.04]There's so many books here.
[218:34.22]I'm so slow right now.
[218:55.96]I can't dodge.
[218:56.62]I was wondering what was going on.
[219:00.84]I couldn't move.
[219:04.90]Misfortune.
[219:07.14]Dunk head in wax.
[219:10.78]Do I want to do that?
[219:16.00]Why would you do this?
[219:16.78]I'm just a candlestick.
[219:27.97]What is the point of that?
[219:37.07]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[219:38.05]What happens if I take this off?
[219:41.09]Doesn't matter.
[219:41.53]I wonder if that's something bad happens.
[219:50.27]Can I do another coat?
[219:52.17]What happens if I do more than one coat?
[220:02.28]There has to be a reason for that.
[220:06.64]I would do that in real life.
[220:08.26]You are absolutely correct.
[220:11.10]I could see that being very fun to do in real life.
[220:16.04]As long as there was a professional around that could keep an eye on me.
[220:20.85]By the way, this is Castle Cainhurst.
[220:25.19]If you took a screenshot of this, and they took a screenshot of the exact same thing in Cainhurst, it's the same game.
[220:36.11]Talking about from Bloodborne, by the way.
[220:43.59]Anything else?
[220:45.53]Let's just move on.
[220:46.23]Whatever.
[220:49.35]Let's move on.
[220:50.47]Oh, wait.
[220:51.87]Hold on.
[220:57.37]Anywhere I can jump.
[221:02.76]Whatever.
[221:04.26]I got a wax head.
[221:07.18]Maybe I have to put a flame on my head.
[221:08.62]Do I have to put a candle on my head?
[221:13.33]That would be cool.
[221:23.76]Whoa!
[221:24.30]Okay, those things can't be hurt.
[221:37.89]really chaos gem here okay I'm not sure what that's doing but doing something
[222:03.42]I wish you could trade Twinkling Titanite for something because I have no use for it.
[222:08.61]Anything else?
[222:19.95]Not really.
[222:28.50]Did everything.
[222:29.06]Let's just go up the stairs.
[222:34.81]This is a creepy place.
[222:37.81]With scary Monstars.
[222:41.65]See, look!
[222:41.95]They have... Look at their heads!
[222:45.54]I can definitely do that.
[223:00.34]This has to be a purpose for that.
[223:12.35]Whoa.
[223:13.91]Crystal Sage is somewhere in the room.
[223:21.94]Found her.
[223:22.42]Ooh, where are you?
[223:31.82]Where are you?
[223:36.11]There.
[223:50.88]Terrifying.
[223:58.26]Wax.
[224:01.86]Are you shitting me right now?
[224:04.16]What?
[224:05.98]I'm actually getting invaded.
[224:08.32]Right now.
[224:10.14]That's great.
[224:26.13]I'm the bearded guy with a bowling ball.
[224:30.93]You think you can fuck with King Bowler Abraham Lincoln?
[224:42.61]Is he fighting right there?
[224:43.37]I can't tell.
[224:51.69]You don't screw this up.
[224:53.37]Where is she?
[224:55.95]Don't hit me right now.
[224:57.05]That's coming so close.
[225:02.58]Thank god the banister's back here.
[225:08.84]You fucking stupid enemy.
[225:16.53]Ugh.
[225:19.18]This is such a bad place to get invaded because she's just gonna keep doing that.
[225:31.41]No, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[225:34.07]Wait a minute.
[225:36.63]Okay, is this guy nice?
[225:38.55]Okay, I think this guy at least has a little bit of an ounce of dignity.
[225:45.62]Alright, can we go like over here?
[225:51.23]Wait, what?
[225:54.23]What is he doing?
[225:59.33]Did he just like, see how, was he just really nice about that?
[226:02.37]What an honorable person.
[226:07.59]Alright, that guy gets just a salute.
[226:11.47]Maybe he just saw how awful that was.
[226:12.99]It was a spot for us to fight.
[226:15.33]What a nice guy.
[226:17.24]I would have fought him if I walked out here.
[226:19.26]This isn't the worst place to fight.
[226:22.48]He just waves.
[226:25.72]Thank you, Wack.
[226:27.34]Two months.
[226:28.10]Thanks a lot, man.
[226:31.61]Alright, well, back to what we were doing.
[226:36.89]Bad spot.
[226:52.22]Yeah, he probably said that.
[226:53.68]What an awful place.
[226:55.48]I'm out of here.
[226:58.38]I didn't know I was gonna invade him in this stupid area.
[227:00.38]I really want to kill this sage.
[227:09.40]It's a real pain in the ass.
[227:18.70]Alright, where is he?
[227:19.16]Where are you going?
[227:20.50]I'm gonna put an end to you.
[227:24.42]Cross that way?
[227:25.16]Okay.
[227:29.60]Anything over here?
[227:30.24]It's a ladder?
[227:32.66]Oh, okay.
[227:46.61]Oh would you just stop it?
[228:16.98]Kymite.
[228:17.78]You're sick and tired of your bullshit.
[228:22.58]Illusionary wall.
[228:23.34]They're coming out of the ground.
[228:29.07]They're coming out of the ground!
[228:33.09]And that's an instant death, by the way.
[228:36.29]That is me instantly dying.
[228:37.83]That's curse, not poison.
[228:48.77]Am I going to have to just sprint through there?
[228:50.59]I have to.
[228:51.09]So where's the exit strategy?
[228:52.41]I think I'm safe right here.
[228:55.97]I don't see anything over to the left.
[228:58.93]That's not going to hit me, is it?
[229:02.57]I mean, I'm going to try just straight ahead.
[229:06.43]Wish me luck.
[229:11.64]I think this is an illusion.
[229:13.80]Yep.
[229:15.81]What is that?
[229:17.13]I don't know what that enemy is.
[229:18.21]I don't know what it is, but... That looks real dangerous.
[229:32.80]This is gonna be hard.
[229:35.18]But sometimes you gotta man up, right?
[229:54.51]And the stupid things on the walls.
[230:06.69]Oh, that was quick.
[230:07.55]That was really fast.
[230:12.50]What is this guy reading?
[230:14.18]Soulstream.
[230:14.70]Okay, I'm dead.
[230:24.42]Oh, I'll try to just run back there.
[230:25.78]I think I'm gonna do it.
[230:30.30]Which way did I go?
[230:40.95]No, that's the skip.
[230:48.23]Oh, well.
[230:48.75]You got full health again.
[230:51.23]Let's try to make this quick.
[230:59.43]I want to kill that thing, though.
[231:00.41]Probably drop something nice.
[231:12.79]um wrap around so get off your seat and jump around jump around jump up jump up back down jump jump jump uh jump up jump up back down jump jump jump I'm getting turned around
[231:49.54]How would you even hit me from there?
[231:51.92]Behind like five boxes.
[231:59.69]What was the way to go?
[232:01.03]Like, seriously.
[232:10.63]What's like the initial path for this place?
[232:12.61]I don't even remember.
[232:13.45]It was too long ago.
[232:16.23]Really?
[232:16.55]Like... Like, really?
[232:18.55]Right now?
[232:18.81]Like, seriously?
[232:20.13]Really, seriously, seriously?
[232:24.62]Uh... Why the fuck... Am I... Am I out of my mind?
[232:29.62]Or am I just going in a circle over and over again?
[232:31.24]Is that, like, not the way I need to go?
[232:35.18]Fucking... Give me a refresh.
[232:40.93]What happened?
[232:46.56]It's not that way.
[232:47.18]I'm just walking in a circle.
[232:51.80]Where's the way to get up?
[232:54.22]And why was it not this hard for me to figure out last time?
[232:56.32]You can stay there.
[233:05.37]I don't care.
[233:06.07]Okay.
[233:09.03]I think I found it.
[233:10.05]The one sliver of area you're supposed to walk to.
[233:12.15]Yeah.
[233:27.55]I just want to go back to that wall.
[233:28.89]See if I can get by these people.
[233:33.67]By the wax heads.
[233:38.70]People are going to sleep.
[233:39.90]Well, good night.
[233:41.28]Thanks for coming out.
[233:43.40]If you're leaving.
[233:43.94]If you're staying, then you're staying.
[233:47.45]Didn't even see this place.
[233:54.59]Witch locks.
[234:00.06]Power within.
[234:06.31]Didn't see you there.
[234:07.15]I think we're almost back to that spot.
[234:19.64]Stay at full HP.
[234:30.01]This place is a labyrinth.
[234:33.80]I thought there was another one here.
[235:02.67]Get this goo off me!
[235:06.98]Get it off!
[235:11.38]Somebody Mario Karted me.
[235:18.72]Did he... Where did you... You got behind me?
[235:22.58]No way!
[235:25.94]There are three of them here, too.
[235:27.56]Crackers!
[235:39.31]Everything is so narrow.
[235:42.27]God, I like prey to get back to go to the swamp area.
[235:46.99]I'm getting sick of fighting people on tiny stairwells and railings.
[235:52.87]That's starting to become just a slight, slight pain in the ass.
[235:56.19]There's even more.
[236:07.50]There are four of these guys up here.
[236:19.74]There's an item over there, too.
[236:20.60]Look at that item.
[236:39.39]Titanite skill.
[236:40.61]I don't need you.
[236:41.59]Alright, let's try this again.
[236:47.98]Hopefully that guy can't snipe me.
[236:50.03]See if I can kill this thing.
[236:52.49]Where are my souls?
[236:54.93]Did I, like, die somewhere?
[236:56.07]Oh, I died over where, like, the guy was reading. ...
[237:40.14]Okay.
[237:42.02]That's an entire set of armor.
[237:43.72]Cool.
[237:47.71]I'll take a whole set of armor.
[237:52.33]I've got a lot of cash now.
[237:57.19]My bank account is full.
[238:08.07]Time to be careful.
[238:10.16]That's a lot to lose.
[238:27.81]No!
[238:34.67]At least you're right here.
[238:35.53]Thank God.
[238:39.15]I would have been so mad.
[238:41.09]Still scroll.
[238:47.66]That was 20,000 souls.
[238:50.12]Oh.
[238:50.30]I gotta go.
[238:52.06]I gotta get to a bathroom.
[238:53.77]I gotta get to a bathroom.
[238:56.03]There's gotta be a bonfire, but thank goodness gracious.
[239:00.11]There's a bathroom down here.
[239:00.97]I know it.
[239:01.29]This is the skip.
[239:10.77]My goodness.
[239:17.86]What?
[239:18.72]What's going on?
[239:22.84]Bookshelves?
[239:29.92]What?
[239:43.04]It wasn't the skip.
[239:43.82]I mean, it's a skip, but not THE skip.
[239:56.87]This is gonna respawn the sage, too.
[239:58.57]Wah-wah.
[240:07.46]But I have way too many souls to just not go back.
[240:14.62]80k souls.
[240:15.04]800,000 souls.
[240:15.42]Let me break 100,000.
[240:20.67]The first time... Come on, 100,000.
[240:27.67]Aww.
[240:27.75]Aww.
[240:40.86]40.
[240:42.16]Take a look at that.
[240:51.71]That is the cap.
[240:55.27]39, 40, 41 does really nothing.
[240:58.65]Dexterity cap.
[241:00.51]Now I can kind of just do whatever I want.
[241:07.93]Can't go wrong with
[241:10.45]Endurance or vigor.
[241:15.57]Why does she do the Orson Welles?
[241:23.80]What do I have?
[241:31.22]Four.
[241:38.03]I could buy more of the, just buy out the whole shop of embers.
[241:49.14]Speaking of Orson Welles, LOL Lineator.
[241:55.92]LOL, no, hold on, I got it.
[241:57.48]LOLinator.
[242:01.55]Might as well just buy one of those.
[242:05.50]Welcome back.
[242:05.86]Thanks for subbing.
[242:07.45]Thanks for subbing.
[242:07.87]Thanks for subbing.
[242:08.25]Thanks for subbing.
[242:09.03]Thanks for subbing.
[242:10.13]Alright.
[242:10.41]I am going to go to the bathroom again.
[242:11.91]I told you I needed a pee fire.
[242:15.25]So, I'll be back.
[242:17.15]About two or three minutes.
[242:20.28]See you in a few.
[242:23.64]I feel like we're close to a boss.
[242:26.32]Okay.
[242:26.92]Be right back.
[244:43.22]I'm eating the best potato chips ever.
[244:49.99]Somebody's gonna have to guess.
[244:53.26]What is the best potato chip that exists?
[245:12.69]Uh, no, it is very specific.
[245:16.55]It's not a flavor, by the way.
[245:23.44]Not Pringle.
[245:26.44]Oh, somebody already got it!
[245:29.32]Baked Lays.
[245:30.92]Dr. Strum Puppet.
[245:32.68]Puppet Doctor, you got it.
[245:34.45]Baked Lays.
[245:39.35]Oh, the best potato chip you could possibly buy.
[245:44.00]I will accept no substitute.
[245:56.33]Continue to quest.
[245:58.13]Baked lays suck.
[246:01.11]Oh, yeah?
[246:07.40]Ow.

[246:59.20]Mondon.
[247:01.28]Mondon or Mondon.
[247:02.88]Whatever you go by.
[247:04.44]I'm dead.
[247:08.52]Just barely got out of there without turning into stone.
[247:15.99]Welcome to the family.
[247:18.44]I'm gonna pick something better than that.
[247:19.52]I haven't been like... My sub of what we call ourselves game tonight has been real off, huh?
[247:27.02]Oh, good family.
[247:28.92]Thanks.
[247:43.87]Again.

[248:01.24]Feel it I can feel it close to something I can feel it Jewel bug Wow that went a lot faster than the other ones
[248:25.66]You looking for a man who likes baked lace to sub to?
[248:27.72]Yeah, I mean, come on.
[248:29.31]This is the best chip ever.
[248:34.91]They only cut you 30% of the time.
[248:37.48]The other 70%?
[248:37.80]Motivating.
[248:52.90]Oh, fuck.
[249:05.14]Was that even worth getting?
[249:13.77]What even is it?
[249:18.99]I like that.
[249:32.64]Put it on for now.
[249:36.12]Oh, hold on a minute.
[249:41.18]Why was I getting poisoned and cursed?
[249:53.23]I didn't pull the lever.
[249:54.85]I didn't make it come back down.
[250:11.32]cured your headache with... That cures your headache?
[250:16.44]Wow, almost didn't make it there.
[250:24.20]This time I'm not gonna die from that.
[250:26.14]I don't have a need to.
[250:27.12]We're just gonna run by these fools.
[250:31.93]Fools!
[250:32.17]How did you even see like that?
[250:37.13]I don't know.
[250:44.43]Come on.
[250:54.37]Alright, what is out here?
[250:55.51]I'm out on the balcony now again.
[250:58.55]I've been here before.
[250:59.79]There's a toad with a lit on fire mace.
[251:07.50]I don't know, guys.
[251:08.00]What do I do about the toad?
[251:10.92]What do I do about the big toad?
[251:18.51]Hopefully those things don't attack me.
[251:19.59]Those ones were shooting lasers at me, weren't they?
[251:21.13]Is this overload?
[251:38.24]Back up, back up!
[251:54.11]Ooh, the fire.
[251:56.83]Fire!
[252:06.09]Big ass wings.
[252:09.53]I didn't.
[252:10.56]I didn't.
[252:11.72]I didn't.
[252:14.60]Toad.
[252:19.36]You effing toad.
[252:25.12]Alright, we're gonna replace the squares with just saying, like, F-ing and, like, S-ing.
[252:30.08]Like, oh, I'm gonna S my pants.
[252:31.40]This is so F-ing stupid.
[252:41.63]That's a fake wall.
[252:51.47]No, F. Did I tell you about these chips?
[253:26.89]Fail.
[253:27.29]What a fail.
[253:29.09]What a fail.
[253:31.69]Come on.
[253:38.86]Take a second.
[253:42.42]Take a second.
[253:42.96]Okay.
[253:43.74]Get up.
[253:44.76]Let's go.
[253:54.34]This one moves real fast.
[254:01.20]Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.
[254:02.30]I don't care.
[254:03.18]Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.
[254:04.36]I don't care.
[254:05.26]Sprint, sprint, sprint.
[254:06.50]I don't care.
[254:07.78]Game sucks.
[254:09.44]This game sucks.
[254:10.48]This game sucks.
[254:11.49]This game sucks.
[254:12.25]Can I get the chant?
[254:13.33]This game sucks.
[254:14.43]This game sucks.
[254:19.27]You bet it sucks.
[254:34.16]I thought that was an outhouse.
[254:40.68]Thanks, Airbrush.
[254:42.82]Airbrush334.
[254:43.08]Welcome back.
[254:43.98]That's not an illusory wall.
[255:11.85]That was so... That looked almost perfect for an illusion wall.
[255:20.58]Mmm.
[255:27.29]Oh, these are so... Mmm.
[255:28.77]Oh.
[255:29.53]Oh.
[255:30.01]Mmm.
[255:31.71]Mmm.
[255:36.62]R.I.P.
[255:36.94]souls.
[255:37.52]It's like 6,000.
[255:43.09]There's a window.
[255:44.93]We can get in that window.
[255:47.19]Look, we're just having fun here.
[255:53.73]I'm looking around, exploring, getting killed by things.
[255:56.78]It's fun.
[255:58.18]Oh, fail failure.
[255:59.54]See that guy doing the FailFish?
[256:02.36]Mmm, it's starting to get under my skin.
[256:05.00]Listen to me, son!
[256:07.52]I'm your dad!
[256:09.93]DESTROY HIM!
[256:13.37]Whoa!
[256:15.07]Signs.
[256:16.49]Or... Sinies, or sinies.
[256:18.86]I'm gonna say signs.
[256:21.94]Or sinies.
[256:24.95]Thanks a lot, man.
[256:25.41]Welcome.
[256:26.35]I'm gonna give this one more try.
[256:27.53]There's a window on the other side.
[256:29.89]One little roll did it.
[256:31.15]Right here.
[256:32.35]Nope.
[256:32.77]Not right there.
[256:33.55]That's gonna land.
[256:40.92]There's a place to go right here.
[256:42.52]Alright.
[256:44.44]Nice.
[256:45.72]So that was worth doing.
[256:50.65]Nothing else over here.
[256:51.45]There's an enemy right there.
[256:54.12]It's one of those horrible dark pursuer type people.
[256:59.57]And a Titanite chunk.
[257:01.87]Huh.
[257:04.17]Signs.
[257:21.71]Um...
[257:24.69]Seems like there's no reason to go man.
[257:27.03]No, it's gonna be all the way.
[257:28.57]Oh shit.
[257:29.39]Hold on I'm just gonna say it's probably gonna be all the way down here if there's an item Something Look at those dragons Wow look at those dragons
[257:58.47]I'm on the back.
[257:58.97]Did he backstab you?
[258:06.00]Fire congregation.
[258:12.80]Guys.
[258:14.74]Guys, really, just calm down for a second.
[258:18.05]Please calm down.
[258:20.85]Alright, what if he's good?
[258:21.89]You're an idiot.
[258:22.69]I'm glad.
[258:23.09]I'm glad I brought you out here because you're stupid and you died.
[258:29.31]I was making that noise.
[258:32.47]It was very loud.
[258:33.25]You're gonna get me all blooded.
[258:55.94]Don't get me all blooded.
[258:59.59]Storyteller's staff?
[259:03.33]Huh.
[259:04.99]Well.
[259:13.26]Well.
[259:16.04]Try jumping.
[259:17.16]Listen to me, son!
[259:19.68]I'm your dad!
[259:22.10]Destroy him!
[259:25.52]Whoa!
[259:28.25]Wondermelon55, thanks for the sub.
[259:30.83]This is dangerous.
[259:35.98]This is dangerous.
[259:36.86]I made it.
[259:43.20]But hey, thanks Wunder.
[259:44.04]Welcome.
[259:46.74]I hope you enjoy your stay.
[259:50.22]At Jerma Island.
[260:03.60]Where did I end up?
[260:06.40]All the way back here, huh?
[260:07.96]Okay.
[260:14.50]That wasn't really worth it.
[260:16.03]I got a storyteller staff.
[260:18.93]And I ended up all the way back here.
[260:21.05]Oh, he's gonna sprint, apparently.
[260:37.33]Welcome to Jurassic Park.
[260:39.89]Do.
[260:47.98]Pointless.
[260:49.96]I'm gonna take that guy's word for it.
[260:51.48]Because that was the dude I saw.
[260:52.88]Remember that guy?
[260:58.18]That guy was on the ledge just for no reason.
[261:06.87]What?
[261:09.22]scholar ring wax what you just pushed me and shoved me around so much
[261:38.43]Alright, so that gave me wax over here.
[261:41.77]I still don't understand what this is for.
[261:45.68]You know, like, what the heck?
[261:47.66]What the heck is that?
[261:53.20]I'm not sure.
[261:54.08]Like, what the heck?
[261:55.75]What the heck is this for?
[262:08.14]The Flavor Bake Lays original.
[262:09.52]You don't have to stray very far from the original formula.
[262:13.86]In my opinion.
[262:17.40]This is the skip.
[262:20.40]I don't need that.
[262:43.22]Alright.
[262:47.71]Back here... I guess just go this way, but instead of dropping... Jumping down, I... Go the other way?
[262:56.77]Was there another way to even go here?
[262:59.62]Alright.
[263:04.08]Yeah, okay.
[263:04.64]So I jumped down.
[263:05.46]I got the items.
[263:06.24]I'm not gonna jump down now.
[263:08.14]Instead of go...
[263:10.56]Unfortunately, this big guy is here.
[263:18.55]I'll run this guy all the way around.
[263:20.55]Fuck.
[263:22.83]Oh, fuck.
[263:28.68]Oh, boy.
[263:43.05]Is there a third one?
[263:43.89]I think there might be three here.
[263:46.03]Ah!
[263:46.67]Okay, I don't think he can get anywhere.
[264:07.33]Titanite chunk.
[264:08.09]I need Titanite slab.
[264:09.17]Did he wrap around?
[264:16.82]Did I go around in a circle?
[264:20.14]Where did I end up?
[264:21.00]Where did I end up?
[264:26.53]What is this?
[264:32.29]Visions of sadness.
[264:34.09]Sure, whatever you say.
[264:39.68]Praise the pointless.
[264:40.90]Praise the pointless.
[264:42.06]Praise the pointless.
[264:44.12]Where'd he go?
[264:51.63]Did he drop?
[264:53.12]I think he fell off.
[264:53.72]Okay, I lucked out there.
[265:01.34]Oh, you hear this guy?
[265:14.10]Oh, look, I can get in here.
[265:16.68]Not so pointless after all.
[265:26.96]Another shard.
[265:31.13]I feel like I'm getting close.
[265:36.67]Close.
[265:38.04]Close.
[265:41.48]Might be getting close to something.
[265:44.04]I don't know what and I don't know where and I don't know how.
[265:50.15]Hmm.
[265:55.16]Okay, I haven't been out here.
[265:56.58]Trio ahead.
[265:57.38]Let me just make sure there's not another door to go in.
[266:06.84]There's some skip I can do.
[266:08.04]Maybe this is the trio.
[266:26.50]It's that guy.
[266:27.24]This is a long way away.
[266:33.77]Maybe I don't aggro him if I don't go near him.
[266:40.99]Is he aggroed?
[266:42.51]I don't think so.
[266:45.98]Yeah, this is a very long way away.
[266:48.99]This is blocked off, so I don't go this way.
[266:52.05]Don't aggro.
[266:52.85]Don't aggro.
[266:53.59]Don't aggro.
[266:54.37]Don't aggro.
[266:57.15]De-aggroed.
[266:58.61]De-aggroed.
[267:00.11]De-aggroed.
[267:01.87]De-aggroed.
[267:06.83]Now it's a horror movie.
[267:08.83]Now it's a horror movie.
[267:11.45]And there's a trio up here.
[267:15.97]Whatever that means.
[267:25.56]Shit.
[267:31.53]Shit.
[267:37.89]Shit.
[267:48.75]Egg rolled.
[267:50.47]I'm so scared right now.
[267:51.77]This is a long trek that I don't want to do again.
[267:57.49]Please get me to like a skipper door or something.
[268:00.03]Oh, old codger.
[268:02.98]Oh, this dude is messed up looking.
[268:08.48]I mean, I feel like I could touch that maybe.
[268:09.98]Listen to me, son.
[268:13.85]I'm your dad.
[268:16.29]Destroy him!
[268:19.73]Whoa!
[268:23.90]A Vios Mojo.
[268:25.98]I'm gonna try.
[268:27.14]That scared the shit out of me, by the way.
[268:34.00]Oi!
[268:34.74]No!
[268:35.40]No!
[268:36.84]No!
[268:38.36]No!
[268:41.77]No!
[268:44.11]No!
[268:45.89]Door.
[268:47.09]Lever.
[268:48.21]Something to push.
[268:48.69]Something to touch.
[268:49.41]Get in here!
[268:58.08]Zalgar and Vios Mojo Joe.
[269:01.24]Thank you for subbing.
[269:05.86]Oh, my heart.
[269:06.72]My heart is doing the thing where it likes to beat.
[269:08.52]You know, when your heart beats.
[269:13.22]Yikes.
[269:17.25]I want to go and burn this ash.
[269:20.07]Let me just multibally for a second.
[269:28.19]Give me a little bit of slack.
[269:29.03]That was terrifying.
[269:29.81]Mm-hmm.
[269:37.65]Mm-hmm.
[269:42.41]Maybe I should put some points on his strength.
[269:51.09]Might as well, I mean.
[269:51.77]Mm-hmm.
[269:57.65]Because that wouldn't be the worst thing I could do.
[269:59.14]More ash.
[270:08.66]What is that then?
[270:11.95]Oh, no.
[270:12.45]There it is.
[270:16.91]Plus seven.
[270:27.48]Take my goddamn money.
[270:28.64]Well, I will.
[270:35.42]If you insist.
[270:44.66]Still never got that coal.
[270:52.23]It's back in like Farron Keep, I think.
[270:56.35]It's the only place I think I didn't get one.
[271:00.98]What's my mood lighting set on right now?
[271:02.28]Energize.
[271:05.16]Currently on Energize.
[271:32.42]Now, these are crunchy.
[271:35.90]Oh, boy.
[271:37.16]These ones are crunchy.
[271:49.65]Alright.
[271:51.95]Maybe fight these guys now.
[271:57.77]I was gonna say, get the weak one out first.
[271:59.67]Get the caster.
[272:03.78]Drank an Estus, you fucker.
[272:06.24]Alright, one down.
[272:08.00]I didn't think he was gonna jump at me.
[272:30.09]The other chap called me a nerd?
[272:33.48]Hey.
[272:37.10]Hey, come on now.
[272:42.50]I gotta eat more chips.
[272:44.64]Gotta give me the strength.
[272:54.72]You can't let it sit there for one second.
[272:57.24]Does it have to seriously go down that fast?
[273:01.02]The only elevators in this area in the whole game that immediately move when you touch the button.
[273:10.27]Every other elevator took at least one second before it moved.
[273:13.55]You have to sprint to not have it happen.
[273:17.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[273:18.85]What was that?
[273:22.01]Top of that thing?
[273:22.81]Can I get on that?
[273:27.88]I guess you get their weapons.
[273:39.89]I probably shouldn't be fighting you like this.
[273:41.28]I can't seem to stun you.
[274:07.27]Two at a time.
[274:07.89]It's never a fun thing.
[274:12.51]No, don't do it.
[274:19.45]I didn't even see him.
[274:23.77]I dodged so perfectly that that guy was not on the screen.
[274:43.85]I just stabbed him in the front?
[274:55.48]Apparently.
[275:07.57]What are we doing here?
[275:08.23]You're just like switching weapons on me over and over again.
[275:15.84]Oh, you fucking magneted to me.
[275:17.82]Oh, a big mistake.
[275:28.92]Don't you know?
[275:29.48]Don't ever ask this when somebody's literally right in front of you.
[275:31.84]Listen to me, son.
[275:34.16]I'm your dad.
[275:35.12]Onikiri and Ubadashi.
[275:36.80]Destroy him!
[275:40.02]Whoa!
[275:43.04]Hey, guy.
[275:43.88]Guy incognito.
[275:45.30]Number 11.
[275:48.04]Welcome, thanks.
[275:49.78]This is a whip.
[275:50.30]I want to carry an Ubudachi.
[275:56.57]This... Okay.
[276:07.32]Ugh.
[276:16.69]That is cool.
[276:17.79]That's cool.
[276:23.73]That's very cool.
[276:27.23]That's probably a great opener.
[276:28.54]Like, if you can sneak up on somebody and just... Oh, you're in the air for a long time.
[276:37.76]Sorry, I'm, like, choking.
[276:43.81]That's a parry.
[276:44.61]I just don't know how to use it correctly.
[276:48.40]Alright, I sprinted by this.
[276:49.32]I want to be sure I didn't miss anything.
[276:53.66]Like my souls.
[276:58.17]Anything else in this area?
[277:01.11]It is this.
[277:03.13]I'll investigate it.
[277:09.04]Well, this is what happens when you don't have anybody clean up the bird shit on statues.
[277:15.82]This is why... This is why your taxes pay for city-wide statue cleaning.
[277:20.28]Otherwise the bird shit takes over.
[277:32.66]I'm gonna go and level up.
[277:38.29]Will I do some PvP tonight?
[277:40.27]Uh... Maybe.
[277:48.08]I'm so sorry that this crunching sounds like I'm eating glass.
[277:52.18]I apologize.
[277:59.76]I mean, if I'm at the end of the game, and I, like, beat the game tonight, then... In a reasonable hour, then yeah, I'll do it.
[278:11.83]Welcome.
[278:12.91]Very good.
[278:32.27]After six hours, were you still on the wall though?
[278:35.53]I went different ways.
[278:37.36]I killed like three bosses, none of which seemed to be storyline bosses.
[278:43.44]I killed the random guy in the ghost world.
[278:48.02]Then I went the other way and I killed the... weird dragon that pissed me off.
[278:54.24]And I killed the slayer dude with the big shield.
[278:57.94]Yeah, I kind of just went in a giant circle and killed all like... I believe those are optional bosses, but I killed all of them.
[279:08.55]So... Yeah, technically I guess I've been in this area for like the last four and a half hours, but...
[279:16.64]Killed like three bosses.
[279:19.04]That's typically what it's been like.
[279:21.06]It's been like pretty much a boss every hour and a half.
[279:22.98]Boss every hour.
[279:23.64]Alright.
[279:29.10]What is up here?
[279:30.62]This place is huge too.
[279:31.94]So I've been taking my time and looking at everything.
[279:36.01]Because this is a first playthrough.
[279:37.87]And there is something going on up those stairs.
[279:40.31]Otherwise why put all that shit all over the place?
[279:47.26]You know what I mean?
[279:50.96]There's even more places to go.
[279:55.36]I could even go over here.
[279:56.42]I can go up here.
[279:58.61]There's a lot to do.
[280:00.79]There's a lot to see.
[280:01.83]Oh, okay.
[280:13.17]All the way up, huh?
[280:20.03]Okay.
[280:24.71]I hope what's up here is worth it.
[280:29.91]Two fat angels.
[280:33.32]The fat angel brothers.
[280:34.50]Oh, boy.
[280:47.21]Is this going to be like a looking glass up here?
[280:48.75]There we go.
[280:53.56]Here's the item I came up here for.
[280:55.52]Hunter's Ring.
[280:57.74]That might actually be pretty good.
[281:01.26]Increases dexterity.
[281:03.59]Wow!
[281:03.93]48 dexterity.
[281:05.49]Yeah.
[281:06.87]I would love to put you on.
[281:10.54]Nice.
[281:13.08]Life ring.
[281:16.36]Dexterity?
[281:16.94]Dexterity.
[281:18.20]And more attack the longer I swing.
[281:23.47]Now we're cooking with gas.
[281:30.59]This one, they're split up.
[281:32.43]So this is a good thing.
[281:35.80]I can't log on to you?
[281:43.05]This is not a place I'd want to be.
[281:48.45]Thank God.
[281:51.25]That's not a spot where this guy is possible to fight.
[281:54.79]I don't know why I fought him there.
[282:00.10]There's nowhere for me to go, and him swinging would take up every area.
[282:04.38]Why does that keep happening when I load up?
[282:07.24]Every damage in the game appears on the screen.
[282:16.50]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[282:17.62]Oh, I don't care about those guys.
[282:24.77]I'm just gonna go down and run to the boss area.
[282:26.77]Oh, come on, Jerry.
[282:33.69]Come on, Jerry.
[282:34.71]I know you have it in you, Jerry.
[282:38.79]You can do this, Jerry.
[282:43.10]Every man for himself, Jerry.
[282:47.62]Every man for himself, Jerry.
[282:58.35]Easy, Jerry.
[283:02.61]So, I've got a feeling that I've got a feeling that I've got a feeling that
[283:14.23]I was expecting something to happen up top, like fire or something.
[283:21.20]I just want to make sure I don't run by an item.
[283:30.52]I really want to throw enemies at you right here.
[283:34.78]What is this?
[283:35.27]Is this another skip?
[283:36.89]What does this lead to?
[283:44.85]I got Titanite junk for coming down the elevator.
[283:54.82]Where is this?
[283:57.74]Visions of Hollow.
[283:59.20]What's for a castle?
[284:06.96]Um...
[284:17.65]Where the hell am I?
[284:18.17]Am I near a bonfire?
[284:22.92]I don't know.
[284:35.84]Red Tearstone Ring?
[284:42.39]Boost attack when HP is low.
[284:56.32]Not today.
[284:59.22]Today I need to find where this skip is.
[285:00.58]And what bonfire is right here.
[285:05.48]If there is one right here.
[285:15.71]Is it just like skip to skip?
[285:22.68]Because I remember... So, what is straight through here?
[285:26.56]I did it.
[285:33.58]This was... Is this where I thought, uh... Yeah, okay.
[285:41.73]So you just turn around and go up there.
[285:44.71]Easy enough.
[285:48.79]Easy enough.
[285:53.74]You go backwards from this bonfire.
[285:57.10]And that should bring me right to the boss.
[286:06.36]Bonfire.
[286:16.13]Do whatever you want with this bonfire.
[286:17.67]Bonfire.
[286:25.88]There are no good beers?
[286:28.00]That's not necessarily true.
[286:29.04]I mean, almost 100% of them are bad, but... I'd say there's probably a few that don't go with the crowd, you know?
[286:48.80]Okay.
[286:50.14]Moment of truth.
[286:50.68]What's in this door?
[286:53.14]You know, when it's a huge door like this, then there's got to be something behind it.
[287:05.31]And... This looks like a boss room.
[287:08.75]Try a close range battle and then try rolling.
[287:12.47]Yeah.
[287:18.04]Oh, dear.
[287:20.32]Another dogged contender.
[287:24.76]welcome unkindled one purloiner of cinders mind you the mantle of lord interests me none the fire linking is this guy talking the legacy of lords let it all fade into nothing you've done quite enough now have your rest
[287:56.76]Alright.
[287:59.36]Lorian, Elder Prince.
[288:02.52]Okay, that's kind of unfair.
[288:04.06]He just teleports around.
[288:08.38]He has fire.
[288:18.47]Let's figure you out.
[288:27.01]He can't walk, so that's, I guess, a plus for me.
[288:29.99]Okay, he can walk.
[288:31.59]He's faking it.
[288:32.13]Dude!
[288:46.26]Do not like that.
[288:57.62]I guess I can still hit him when he's teleporting.
[289:07.11]Fuck.
[289:09.75]Alright, get off him.
[289:15.51]What does that move do?
[289:20.31]I guess if you're just not dodging when he does that?
[289:25.25]I don't know.
[289:26.91]But we're going to give him... We're going to really give him a run for his money here.
[289:30.63]I have lightning.
[289:32.45]Okay, human.
[289:34.19]I'm going to take that off.
[289:36.29]Try lightning.
[289:40.57]And we're also going to do... How much... Magic damage or something?
[289:48.68]Because that does a lot.
[289:51.72]No, I think I'll be fine.
[289:52.62]I just didn't really know what it did.
[289:56.45]One more try without an ember.
[289:58.10]Because I don't even know what his phase two is.
[290:10.22]Don't you hate him when you spill spinach all over your crotch?
[290:14.84]Yeah, that's gotta suck.
[290:16.82]Especially if it's like spinach dip.
[290:21.74]You'll never get that out.
[290:40.87]I hope I don't have to open the door again.
[290:42.77]No, I don't.
[290:49.39]The white one was he charges his sword with light.
[290:51.99]Yeah, I mean, I know what it does, but I don't know how fast it is or how much it arcs.
[290:57.76]God, every time.
[290:58.72]I bet you he gets me with that every time.
[291:01.52]So I gotta take these before I even get in.
[291:03.60]Alright.
[291:06.16]That was... This one's a wash, I think.
[291:10.36]Yeah.
[291:10.67]I just completely forgot.
[291:11.69]I thought that was just part of, like, the cutscene.
[291:14.29]But, no.
[291:15.95]Literally, when you touch this door, he is teleporting onto you, swinging.
[291:20.57]So, that's good to know.
[291:25.13]No, I'm not... Yeah, I'll use it.
[291:37.14]So both of these have to be taken before I go in the mist.
[291:49.11]Ten attempts?
[291:49.79]I don't think it'll take that long.
[291:54.97]At least in the first phase, he seems pretty self-exemplary.
[291:59.25]You know, sort of explanatory.
[292:13.55]I just need to remember that he does the insta-attack.
[292:16.17]I didn't hit it.
[292:32.92]Alright.
[292:34.44]Eat this.
[292:35.60]Like this.
[292:37.28]Let's go, Prince Dorian!
[292:50.70]He swung too late for that one.
[293:05.95]The tough part about the teleport is you could lose line of sight.
[293:14.90]You could just be anywhere.
[293:17.40]Like that.
[293:46.57]Now it's phase two.
[293:54.33]Does he even have phase two?
[293:56.43]I'm sitting here waiting for him to do something.
[294:07.74]Oh boy!
[294:36.80]That's definitely phase one Maybe not she's gonna do like a magic spell to him obviously, right?
[294:45.50]Oh
[294:49.60]Oh, dear brother, I'm on my way.
[294:55.12]Yeah, she comes down and goes like, and he can walk.
[295:01.50]My brother, unyielding sword of Lothric's prince, rise if you weren't.
[295:15.36]Oh, great.
[295:20.62]I'm glad I get to do another boss that.
[295:22.18]You have a phase one, a whole life bar, a cutscene, and then a whole boss fight again.
[295:29.06]They already pulled this trick on me.
[295:32.52]Now she's on his back?
[295:35.35]Fantastic.
[295:49.23]At least get enough power to stand up.
[295:53.79]What?
[295:55.19]Oh, boy.
[296:02.86]He's shooting me.
[296:03.88]Oh, dear.
[296:09.22]This just got really annoying.
[296:25.98]Man, that's so horrible.
[296:27.60]When he teleports and you lose the line of sight and you're not locked on and he's doing that move and you don't know where he is.
[296:36.18]Okay, well.
[296:42.01]Alright.
[296:44.91]I just gotta be really careful in phase one.
[296:51.25]More projectiles to be... Oh, wrong way.
[296:57.11]More projectiles to be worried about.
[296:59.03]The white missile has an audio cue.
[297:07.02]Yeah, but I mean... I mean, trying to dodge when you hear the sound, it's much easier to see where he is and when he's casting it.
[297:38.35]I wonder who is easier to kill.
[297:40.69]I wonder if I should just try to focus on killing one of them at a time.
[297:44.59]We'll see.
[298:01.31]I'm not going to use the gold pine yet.
[298:12.35]oh I was missing the timings on these so
[298:46.63]Oh, you don't usually swing a second time, do you?
[298:50.07]Uh-huh.
[299:16.45]I got greedy.
[299:46.14]Ooh, caught me on that one.
[299:50.48]Yeah, I'm gonna... Shit, I didn't even know he did that move.
[299:55.74]Okay, here we go.
[300:02.52]Alright.
[300:13.23]Wow, that was weird.
[301:14.36]Oof, I just barely dodged it.
[301:15.80]Whoa, I did it again!
[301:25.74]It's still shooting at me.
[301:43.31]What?
[301:44.02]WHAT?
[301:47.58]What the fuck was that?
[301:50.30]What the fuck was that shit?
[301:55.10]I very clearly dodged that.
[301:57.45]I dodged- I didn't get hit by that at all.
[302:03.05]That was bullshit.
[302:08.31]That was total bullshit.
[302:12.09]What the fuck was that?
[302:17.57]I was so clearly not hit by that.
[302:23.25]If anybody can tell me what actually hit me, I'd like to know.
[302:27.02]Because that was total dog shit.
[302:37.32]I'm not talking about the fire, I'm talking about the laser beam sword.
[302:41.36]The laser beam sort of apparently hit me.
[302:44.53]There's... there's no way.
[302:46.89]I absolutely refuse to believe that.
[302:54.58]That was fucking so stupid.
[302:58.70]Does the beam grow by... widen by like three feet?
[303:04.53]It didn't even touch me.
[303:11.35]He was dead, too.
[303:12.05]Like, that's just fucking dumb.
[303:14.17]One tiny little fucking thing that can go wrong.
[303:16.67]Of course.
[303:28.12]Okay, didn't hit me that time.
[303:29.12]Cool.
[303:30.46]Okay.
[304:02.62]Thank you.
[304:28.25]Trying to get ready for the next phase.
[304:30.78]I'm getting too greedy.
[305:10.57]Okie dokie, here we go.
[305:59.01]Oh my god.
[305:59.79]That's... Even if you... Yeah, you gotta dodge twice there, because it's just one, two.
[306:08.32]Oh my god.
[306:09.16]Uh...
[306:28.42]That's so punishing.
[306:30.18]Like everything else in this whole goddamn game.
[306:57.27]The big problem is just the girl on the back, or the dude on the back, whatever it is.
[307:03.05]After he does just the projectiles.
[307:07.87]Projectiles seriously are the bane of my entire Dark Souls existence.
[307:14.94]And they put so many more in this game.
[307:20.06]There's so many more projectiles to worry about.
[307:30.74]I can... I'll do... I'll just do magic.
[307:33.44]No, I'll do fire.
[307:34.60]I mean, it's not... He is fire, but... I'll put the person on his back.
[307:47.49]Because that's killed me two times now.
[307:49.89]I just needed to go... You dodge the first one, the second one comes right on you.
[308:03.10]I'm not gonna get hit here at all.
[308:52.61]Full health.
[308:55.55]Eat this.
[308:57.01]Burn the sword and let's go.
[309:06.47]Come on.
[309:20.49]He very rarely does that, but when he does, I'm not ready for it.
[309:38.87]Oh, he's right next to me.
[310:00.99]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[310:05.54]Thank you for something.
[310:11.93]How you doing?
[310:46.64]See, that didn't kill me this time.
[310:48.12]Thank god.
[311:35.42]Okay, now it's just her?
[311:40.25]Oh, she's reviving him.
[311:43.39]Fuck.
[311:44.35]God.
[311:47.17]Okay.
[311:48.23]I didn't know that.
[312:35.54]Hit her!
[312:36.88]Hit her!
[312:38.50]Oh, my God.
[312:40.90]Oh, my God.
[312:44.90]Okay.
[312:45.26]I did it.
[312:45.80]Yep.
[313:12.13]Yeah, that was almost a... I almost choked so hard.
[313:22.38]Anything else in here to do?
[313:23.22]I don't think so.
[313:35.93]I have another crown to put on the... You know, that thing.
[313:52.56]See what their soul gives you.
[314:04.01]Lothric's Holy Sword.
[314:05.19]Or Lorien's Greatsword.
[314:14.86]Cool.
[314:21.87]I'm just going to smash it.
[314:28.77]100k.
[314:30.09]Did it.
[314:37.15]Can't be much more to the game.
[314:38.31]I would be surprised if there was.
[314:54.06]No more endurance.
[314:58.24]Still need... Anything else to break?
[315:04.06]Putting the crown up there.
[315:04.88]Let's put the crown on the stove.
[315:13.08]There's the little... No.
[315:14.72]What is it over here?
[315:15.34]Oh, it's the giant.
[315:17.88]He's already there.
[315:18.52]Do I need to kill this dude?
[315:20.73]Oh, right there, I think.
[315:31.40]Mm-hmm.
[315:33.60]Whose head goes where?
[315:35.84]Up at the very top?
[315:36.99]Is this the last guy?
[315:37.81]Maybe it's the final piece of the puzzle.
[315:50.10]There it is.
[315:50.62]Holy King Lothric, right?
[315:53.14]Oh.
[316:10.40]Prince Lothric?
[316:11.14]Did I miss a chair?
[316:12.14]That looks like the only place I can put it.
[316:29.47]These all go in their respective places.
[316:38.47]Phone.
[316:38.91]Phone.
[316:39.41]Telephone call.
[316:54.71]Oh, you... Alright.
[316:58.34]You can't put it on there when you're standing in front of it.
[317:00.40]You need to be five feet away down below.
[317:02.56]Are we going to conduct the ritual?
[317:11.48]Alright, let's conduct the ritual.
[317:20.52]Okay.
[317:20.66]Oh boy.
[317:20.84]Here comes... I put all the crystal skulls on their thrones and now she's gonna turn into the ultimate warrior.
[317:25.96]She's gonna suplex me.
[317:51.31]Noble Lords of Cinder.
[317:56.73]The fire fades.
[317:58.95]Wait, is the guy on the... The dude is still alive and he'll just be burnt right now?
[318:03.13]And the Lords go without thrones.
[318:10.19]This dude's gonna light on fire.
[318:11.13]One of you guys is still alive.
[318:15.06]Surrender your fires.
[318:19.95]Oh, here they go.
[318:27.88]Turns out you were the bad guy all along.
[318:35.18]Didn't we have an agreement that we weren't going to do this?
[318:40.36]She's going to blow it out?
[318:47.64]Just blow it out.
[318:49.04]We had an agreement.
[318:52.61]Don't give me dandruff.
[318:53.47]I just took care of that with head and shoulders.
[319:00.01]Funny joke.
[319:01.01]Funny guy.
[319:01.87]Funny jokes.
[319:03.29]He said dandruff because it looks like dandruff.
[319:05.05]Funny.
[319:13.94]Let him grant death to the old gods of Lordran.
[319:23.14]Deliverers of the first flame.
[319:25.40]Yeah.
[319:29.50]Alright.
[319:31.13]And then play, like, rock music.
[319:33.43]End credits.
[319:35.49]Give me some alternative rock.
[319:38.67]New spot.
[319:45.63]Oh, I know where this is.
[319:46.52]This is where Gwen... This is where Gwendolyn... Gwen took the fire in his hand and he said, I will be the king.
[319:53.59]This is the first, this is the place where Gwen did it.
[319:56.44]Oh, Gwen.
[319:57.10]Gwen.
[319:58.04]Gwen.
[320:00.00]Look, there's Gwen.
[320:03.06]Praise the sun.
[320:04.60]Gorgeous view.
[320:05.34]Gwen.
[320:09.65]Oh.
[320:20.52]Okay.
[320:22.27]Bonfire, bonfire, bonfire.
[320:25.73]Get all the summoning signs.
[320:27.73]Alright, let's go get our ass kicked by the last boss, because that's definitely who's up here.
[320:31.63]And it's definitely Gwyn.
[320:34.29]He's gonna resurrect and be like, You thought I was dead in this first game into the second game?
[320:41.61]Well, that's really cool looking.
[320:45.15]That's kind of hurting my head.
[320:46.57]I can't look at it anymore.
[320:47.59]I'm seriously getting sick looking at that.
[320:57.21]There he is.
[320:57.57]There's Gwyn.
[320:58.71]There he comes.
[320:59.17]Gwyn.
[321:07.64]This is the last boss?
[321:09.92]He better turn into a giant demon.
[321:13.06]Otherwise, just a guy.
[321:14.00]A guy with a sword.
[321:14.92]Okay, well that was a weird move.
[321:24.77]He has a lot of delay.
[321:37.48]That's a lot of weird delay.
[321:46.43]Now he has a different weapon?
[321:47.39]Okay.
[321:53.95]Oh, I thought he was going to do it again.
[321:58.86]He gets every move from the bosses in the game?
[322:03.12]That's super cool.
[322:13.21]Maybe it just doesn't stop now.
[322:23.28]That is annoying.
[322:23.88]It's going to happen for the rest of the fight, isn't it?
[322:27.86]Come on, Gwen.
[322:29.81]Listen, Gwen.
[322:31.89]Come on, Gwen.
[322:35.23]Easy, Gwen.
[322:35.69]Come on, Gwen.
[322:45.86]Come on, Gwen.
[322:49.51]He's doing this over and over again, isn't he?
[322:52.40]And then he heals too.
[322:54.70]Good to know, Gwen.
[322:59.86]Another move set.
[323:01.56]He put on a different weapon.
[323:03.50]He's cartwheeling around.
[323:13.88]I feel...
[323:20.81]I did that to him.
[323:21.83]Ow.
[323:23.31]Ow.
[323:28.13]Ow.
[323:28.33]In what word... What... What the fuck was that?
[323:37.46]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[323:42.40]Poor talks.
[323:42.92]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[323:45.76]Oh, let's see here.
[323:48.32]I'm not going to do fire, obviously.
[323:49.64]This is a fire guy.
[323:51.68]Let's do some magic.
[323:53.36]Let's do dark.
[323:55.86]Dark, and I only have one of these left.
[323:57.12]I have to buy more of those.
[324:01.92]I think you died a little.
[324:02.78]Yeah, I think I died just a little bit.
[324:04.32]Just a little.
[324:07.78]Here comes Gwen of the First Flame.
[324:11.06]Introducing... Gwen.
[324:15.57]Oh, shit.
[324:15.91]I did fire.
[324:16.77]I forgot this was still on the bar.
[324:20.14]Come on Gwen Come on Gwen Come on Gwen No I wanted to drink
[324:57.76]Come on, Gwen!
[325:03.98]See that delay right there?
[325:05.21]Yowzers!
[325:06.55]Okay, now this is just magic.
[325:07.71]He does magic here.
[325:11.03]I thought it was going to be the thing.
[325:12.25]Yeah, that.
[325:22.02]Back to back.
[325:22.82]Fuck you.
[325:24.06]Why are they not shooting?
[325:25.66]What the hell was... What's going on?
[325:26.68]Why are they... They just like disappeared into his body.
[325:29.82]What is... How did I not get hit by... Why haven't those things shot?
[325:34.08]Please shoot.
[325:34.84]What are they doing?
[325:36.68]They keep not... They're going... They're teleporting back into his body.
[326:01.58]I'm having trouble just keeping up with his moves because he has so many of them.
[326:11.95]Back to the fire moves.
[326:13.01]These aren't terrible.
[326:16.13]Unless he skewers me, which he might.
[326:27.73]I tried to dodge around him, of course, I dodged right into his fucking crotch.
[326:32.53]Come on, Gwyn.
[326:41.19]I hate that!
[326:49.86]When you take, like, fucking forever to swing.
[326:53.66]Way worse than if he just was spamming it at me.
[327:03.06]Like that.
[327:03.72]Like that.
[327:04.00]That sucks such ass.
[327:08.97]He like pump fakes you.
[327:10.15]It's fucking annoying.
[327:18.34]That wasn't backstab I guess.
[327:27.77]I'm probably not going to kill him.
[327:42.86]I got him lower than before.
[328:11.81]Ah, there it is.
[328:12.57]I got him closer than before.
[328:15.63]Oh, no, no, no.
[328:25.74]I tried to Vistula.
[328:27.06]When he went down that first time, I tried to do it, and it didn't do anything.
[328:31.98]Like, literally the first time he went down to that first knee, I went right in his face and hit R, right bumper, and it didn't do anything.
[328:53.61]Oh, I want more of those.
[328:54.59]I want more of these.
[328:55.51]I'll have one of these on the bar.
[329:00.79]Whatever.
[329:01.11]Hey, how about you stop backseating, Star?
[329:07.08]Go beat the game for like a fucking third time.
[329:28.27]God damn it.
[329:29.53]No, I'm not close enough.
[329:47.88]Oh, the fucking giant golf swing!
[329:55.96]No, stop with that shit.
[329:57.52]Uh, I might as well just restart.
[330:00.50]God, I wish Star would shut the fuck up.
[330:03.54]Wouldn't that be amazing if Star would shut the fuck up?
[330:11.23]How awesome would that be?
[330:13.49]For once in his fucking goddamn life.
[330:17.69]If he would just close his fucking yap trap for once.
[330:40.61]God, just go away.
[330:41.87]You fucking dick burger.
[330:50.28]Oh, fuck.
[331:05.20]God damn it.
[331:09.31]I can't handle the delayed swings.
[331:11.75]I can't do it.
[331:13.09]They take too long to happen.
[331:14.49]He's doing this again.
[331:52.30]Oh fuck.
[332:12.67]What was that stupid move?
[332:15.83]He just like did a back handspring for no reason.
[332:19.65]That's like really fucking me up.
[332:27.31]Oh god, what's that?
[332:34.84]God damn it.
[333:03.82]How do you dodge that?
[333:06.64]Oh, I'm dead.
[333:10.07]I guess I'm still alive.
[333:14.71]Oh, god.
[333:20.62]Ugh.
[333:32.09]Alright, I just banned Star from talking.
[333:39.59]They can no longer speak.
[333:54.32]Why do they have to back handspring?
[333:57.18]Fuck you, game.
[333:59.76]You're like fucking joke character that does circus cartwheels Such trouble with this well, it's just it's so hard for me to do this and I didn't drink the second
[334:26.25]When he does, like, the little crow hop runs, you just expect the sword to come down, but it just fucking doesn't.
[334:30.89]I'm just gonna die.
[334:37.24]Just kill me.
[334:38.38]This is a wash.
[335:14.77]Relaxation hotline?
[335:17.05]No, he's not allowed to join this fucking call.
[335:19.65]There isn't even a call going.
[335:33.69]I'm gonna get you.
[335:43.67]uh uh
[336:11.12]Honeyhop!
[336:13.68]Shit, I thought I was gonna be the straight one.
[336:29.90]I wish those things would shoot.
[336:35.64]Why do they do that sometimes?
[336:37.95]They go back into his body.
[336:39.11]Why do they do that shit?
[336:42.15]I don't know, what the hell?
[337:00.42]He's like slapping me.
[337:31.26]Alright, what?
[337:32.86]I was told to do a visceral, and I was just right in front of his face, and I didn't do anything.
[337:45.50]Damn it, I thought I got away from him.
[337:56.89]What?
[338:35.02]Oh, you went in my face.
[339:02.72]die die die no no no there's another phase no it can't be
[339:44.88]This guy's fucking dead.
[339:56.85]This guy's dead.
[340:00.61]This guy's dead.
[340:02.37]I'm gonna kill him this time.
[340:05.05]Game sucks.
[340:10.50]Game sucks.
[340:16.58]Game sucks.
[340:19.14]Game sucks.
[340:22.55]Come on.
[340:24.11]Fucking game sucks.
[340:33.89]Something weird is going on.
[340:50.75]It takes so fucking long.
[341:02.35]Dude, it's like first phase is harder than the second phase.
[341:05.07]This, this... Just kill me.
[341:07.51]No, don't just kill me.
[341:11.49]I have more trouble in this first fight than everything in the entire rest of the fight.
[341:26.05]Yeah, like seriously, this first, like, the first like 40% of his health, I find unbearable.
[341:33.77]Because of just how oddly delayed his swings are.
[341:40.50]Like, it's un-fucking-bearable.
[341:43.20]When he takes like a full two seconds to swing that sword.
[341:46.34]And then sometimes he doesn't.
[341:47.44]And then sometimes he does.
[342:07.38]so
[342:26.04]Oh, my hands are sweating.
[342:30.83]Nah, I'm gonna die.
[342:31.19]I don't wanna die.
[342:33.51]Start over.
[342:35.41]It'll take three full seconds to swing your sword.
[343:02.42]Like my hands are just like grease right now Get this off my bar Actually I want to do this I could buy it
[343:27.19]I gotta see how much damage this does to him.
[343:44.42]Not really much of a difference.
[343:50.38]Not much of a difference!
[344:01.36]Uh-huh.
[344:47.67]Oh, bye!
[344:48.53]I thought that was going to be my sayonara right there.
[345:07.36]I don't know.
[345:22.43]I got trapped in here.
[345:32.45]I might... I think I might...
[345:35.97]do a little change here.
[345:38.29]I might go and do something real quick.
[345:57.98]Do I want to do it?
[345:58.88]Let's see.
[345:59.32]I mean, this is the last boss.
[346:03.31]How long does that last?
[346:06.74]I need to get the Golden Fruit Loops.
[346:15.18]Alright, now I have to beat him, Spartan.
[347:00.31]Oh, I think I might just be getting too tired
[347:03.62]I think I'm just drained of energy at the moment.
[347:07.36]I'm gonna have to try this tomorrow.
[347:09.48]I am like just totally mentally exhausted right now.
[347:28.65]You know when you're playing a game and it feels like you're playing from somebody else's eyes?
[347:34.29]Oh my god.
[347:41.58]I feel like I'm watching a TV show right now.
[347:44.76]I feel like I'm not even playing the game.
[347:45.86]I think I got those souls.
[347:58.31]You know when things just start to blur together?
[348:00.79]I'm not even playing against this guy.
[348:03.96]Somebody else is holding my hands and pressing the buttons.
[348:34.60]I'm on strings.
[348:36.56]Somebody has a marionette.
[349:02.00]I'll be happy if I get him to phase two again.
[349:17.05]What the fuck was that?
[349:23.26]That was a mistake.
[349:28.20]You gotta do your back handspring, come on.
[349:55.82]Oh, here you go.
[349:58.22]At least I got him to phase two.
[350:03.10]Oh, fuck.
[350:04.34]For some reason I thought that wasn't going to reach all the way over here.
[350:12.66]I'm getting comboed again.
[350:13.66]Now I'm dead.
[350:16.12]Yeah, I'm going to bed.
[350:17.64]I have two drains to continue fighting this guy at the moment.
[350:26.18]I will beat this game tomorrow.
[350:28.80]I will finish this game tomorrow.
[350:31.32]One more try.
[350:38.14]This is the last try.
[350:49.44]There's gotta be the one.
[350:51.91]Otherwise, I'm going to finish it on a different time.
[351:14.36]Thank you.
[351:41.69]Ah, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated.
[351:45.41]And we just got toxic.
[351:50.05]Stop doing the backflip!
[352:23.59]Shit, I thought that was going to be the beam.
[352:26.23]Speaking of beams!
[352:44.30]No!
[352:45.40]I thought he was going to swing around.
[352:57.75]listen to me son I'm your dad destroy him I'm gonna try
[353:26.32]There we go.
[353:57.62]It's so hard to determine that one.
[354:02.34]It really is.
[354:03.63]And it takes you almost 100% of your health to beat that if it gets you in it.
[354:11.09]Snap me.
[354:18.22]Snap me.
[354:33.46]I don't know what that's doing.
[354:56.24]Shit!
[354:56.74]He still hit me with it and I dodged the first one.
[355:00.44]Fuck.
[355:08.47]That might be it.
[355:18.67]What?!
[355:20.14]What?!
[355:21.86]That was like mid-dodge and he just... That was fucking stupid.
[355:25.54]What a crock of shit.
[355:29.90]What like a crock of absolute shit.
[355:34.38]Are you dodging right now?
[355:35.92]Let me like just fucking grab you in invincibility.
[355:39.08]Like rip around and you dodge into me.
[355:42.40]Nah, I can beat this fucking stupid shithead.
[355:50.10]I can beat this fucking asshole.
[355:55.17]I just have to hope he doesn't magnetize to my body with his grab.
[356:01.96]This fucking guy's dead.
[356:04.04]You're done now, buddy.
[356:06.30]This game over for you.
[356:13.53]Listen to me, son!
[356:20.31]I'm your dad!
[356:22.75]DESTROY HIM!
[356:26.39]I thought it was the magic thing.
[356:52.98]I didn't think it was that.
[357:20.52]Oh shit, not in a good spot.
[357:22.70]Gotta get away from the corner.
[357:46.53]using way too many estuses also something else I'm like I'm kind of gimping myself I'm not taking any items I I really should go get like more stamina items
[358:00.21]Yeah, I think I'm just going to let him kill me.
[358:01.47]I'm going to let him kill me, because I don't think... This one's a wash.
[358:06.07]Three Estus Blasts, not even phase one.
[358:13.33]I want to go get... You know, I am just gimping myself.
[358:17.49]I'm not giving my... I'm not giving myself the chance that I should be getting.
[358:24.52]I need to go back.
[358:25.12]I need to get items.
[358:26.00]I need to get... You know, I've got to do a few things.
[358:39.35]Because right now I'm just fighting him over and over again.
[358:44.43]And I'm like 30% weaker for no reason.
[358:47.69]I don't know why I'm not doing this.
[358:50.51]So I need to get some souls.
[358:59.34]I'm going to go like here.
[359:06.99]Weapon infusion?
[359:08.67]Uh, I don't have anything that I can put on it.
[359:13.23]I'm missing one coal and I have no idea where it is.
[359:16.61]And everything else turns it into a magic weapon.
[359:18.66]So, I have, I can't do anything.
[359:20.20]I can't infuse it.
[359:21.96]Everything, all the infusions that I can do make this weapon worse.
[359:27.96]Unless I should just get no scaling and put on one of like the fire or something.
[359:36.14]Didn't we already go over that?
[359:36.94]I thought we already went over this.
[359:38.32]I need to find like an enemy.
[359:52.27]I'm looking for a bad guy.
[360:00.43]I'd like to fight a bad guy, please.
[360:19.66]Oh shit, I thought I could interrupt him.
[360:22.98]Oh, you're not dead.
[360:40.84]How are you still alive?
[360:56.64]I need... Oh, you need to die.
[361:10.81]And then you also need to die.
[361:12.75]I was gonna do the same thing to you, man.
[361:33.58]You always just wait till I drink an Estus, don't you?
[361:36.28]Hide behind your fucking shield.
[361:38.48]Until I press... X. Okay, that's enough.
[361:42.71]I can go back now.
[361:45.89]Uh, isn't there a bonfire, like, right here?
[361:48.85]Hold on, I'm gonna try my new item.
[361:50.75]This thing.
[361:52.58]Oh, look at this.
[361:53.08]Ready?
[362:04.49]Okay.
[362:10.53]Yeah, so see?
[362:11.43]The fused weapon.
[362:14.01]Like... I mean... It could do refined, but it wouldn't... Is that better?
[362:21.98]Or is that, like, exactly the same?
[362:27.21]Yeah.
[362:28.35]Like, this just turns it into magic weapons.
[362:30.09]It just makes me do less damage.
[362:34.83]I never found the thing that allowed me to use sharp gems for some reason.
[362:37.93]I don't know why.
[362:40.81]I don't know why.
[362:41.67]Because this takes away scaling.
[362:46.77]It just makes it 273, but it's worse.
[362:49.67]I mean, if I'm just going to do math in my head, what's 196 plus 138?
[362:56.74]No.
[362:56.80]It's not.
[363:06.35]I do have sharp gems, but I never apparently picked up the coal required to use the sharp gem.
[363:13.10]I know, odd.
[363:14.20]I have every other one except for that one.
[363:30.37]Maybe I should do bleed.
[363:32.47]I'm just going to bleed the shit out of him.
[363:36.13]Does he even have blood?
[363:40.08]Who knows?
[363:41.96]We'll find out.
[364:02.94]Sharp does a bunch of better scaling.
[364:04.58]I know.
[364:06.24]I know it would make this from like a C to like a B or an A. It's just, I don't know where it is.
[364:10.83]And I really kind of don't want to go looking for it right now.
[364:13.41]I'm just going to bleed.
[364:19.91]Why not?
[364:20.61]I'm just going to hit the shit out of him and have him bleed.
[364:26.37]alright I don't know how I'll give it a couple more and then I think I'm gonna I'm gonna have to call it at some point here win or lose fire
[365:01.40]Now he's got that.
[365:22.20]Not the staff.
[365:43.86]Now see that I don't understand How is he down stunned?
[365:50.40]And then can just get up and fucking hit like he's stunned on the ground
[366:06.75]That was the heal.
[366:19.13]Dammit.
[366:54.45]I thought he was done.
[367:28.27]Thank you.
[367:58.32]Now he's trying to dodge around it.
[368:25.03]No!
[368:40.12]Get me out of here, mommy.
[368:41.93]Mommy, I don't want to fight the boss anymore.
[368:45.05]Mommy, I don't want to fight the boss anymore.
[368:57.54]I did it, mommy.
[369:05.63]Okay.
[369:28.59]Look at how much fucking health I have.
[369:29.75]Wait, didn't I not want to link this?
[369:49.42]Get down the life tree.
[369:54.48]Alright, hold on.
[369:55.16]Let me do something real quick.
[369:57.66]need to unlock the chat let me let me unlock the chat my chat taking it off sub mode let me just do that oh that was that was a that was a thing wasn't it
[370:32.21]Alright.
[370:35.07]Hi, guys.
[370:41.43]You're all free.
[370:48.69]Oh, that was painful.
[370:52.97]I seriously, like, I almost died.
[370:55.19]I almost died because of the look of my health.
[370:59.82]Seriously, almost died.
[371:00.58]Let me get my souls.
[371:01.44]Was it zero there?
[371:07.10]Zero.
[371:11.96]There we go.
[371:12.66]Link the first flame.
[371:13.72]Fine.
[371:14.21]Sure.
[371:22.11]Summon sign?
[371:22.75]What are you guys talking about?
[371:34.10]Where is she?
[371:34.80]Like, a summon sign?
[371:39.08]Why wouldn't she just be, like, I have to, like, summon her like she's a fucking player?
[371:44.00]Like, a multiplayer character?
[371:48.91]How would I ever know that?
[371:50.77]I thought that was, like, a multiplayer thing.
[372:00.34]How was I ever supposed to know that?
[372:03.72]Alright.
[372:09.71]Begin journey two.
[372:11.63]Journey two can be initiated from the shrine.
[372:15.13]No, don't begin journey two.
[372:23.88]I'll tell you what I feel about that.
[372:25.14]You want to see how I feel about that?
[372:27.10]Yeah, let me get a couple levels.
[372:33.85]Let's get some more vitality.
[372:38.97]Oh, look!
[372:39.63]There she is!
[372:40.21]Give me your eyes.
[372:46.52]Who else?
[372:47.72]What's up with you, huh?
[372:50.16]Fucking pieces of shit!
[372:51.86]I'm gonna go on fucking rampage!
[372:55.66]Oh, yeah, nice hard work!
[373:00.71]What's up?
[373:01.73]What up?
[373:02.19]Who else is up?
[373:02.69]Who else is in here?
[373:04.21]Who else is in here for my rage to hold no bounds?
[373:12.28]Anybody else?
[373:13.38]Hmm.
[373:14.66]Any sneaky people upstairs?
[373:19.42]Who's left?
[373:19.74]Who's fucking left?
[373:20.72]Dark Souls 3, I beat you.
[373:26.82]Where's the guy in the chair?
[373:27.70]Oh, he already died.
[373:28.38]He died of old age.
[373:34.98]Oh, shit.
[373:35.48]I shouldn't have done that.
[373:36.22]I kind of feel bad now.
[373:43.12]But it's alright.
[373:44.30]I beat the game.
[373:46.02]So they're going to respawn, right?
[373:59.31]When I go to the bonfire?
[374:01.92]See, look.
[374:03.24]See, they're back.
[374:05.18]It was just a fun little thing.
[374:06.40]Oh, shit.
[374:09.22]They really are all gone.
[374:10.24]Are there people outside, too?
[374:19.85]Might as well, alright.
[374:25.85]Yeah, but... So, it doesn't matter.
[374:28.16]I messed up the ending.
[374:30.24]Oh, well.
[374:33.90]I was just happy to be done beating that boss that I didn't think to look about.
[374:37.94]Look around for summoning signs.
[374:41.20]I thought that was just going to light the bonfire.
[374:43.08]Oh, look.
[374:43.42]Somebody else is down here.
[374:45.44]What's your story?
[374:47.54]There you are.
[374:49.92]As I said, I am Carla.
[374:53.69]And I'm grateful to you.
[374:56.96]Now, what shall we do?
[374:59.02]I have an idea.
[375:00.46]You're a fickle woman.
[375:07.33]Give me your stuff!
[375:09.67]Ah, nice.
[375:19.82]She's saved by the hobbit hole.
[375:26.37]I still have an area to do.
[375:27.41]I do.
[375:35.61]I killed everybody.
[375:36.33]Alright, let's go to the entrance.
[375:43.55]Uh, where is the other one?
[375:53.97]Yeah, the worst one of all, I feel.
[375:55.62]I feel the blacksmith was the worst one of all.
[375:57.72]I feel really bad about that one, because he was just like, hey, how are you again?
[376:02.44]He just had no time to react.
[376:03.94]I feel like if he got up and fought me, it might have been a good fight.
[376:09.28]I didn't even give him a chance.
[376:10.14]Isn't there an NPC right... Alright.
[376:12.12]No, I thought that was an NPC.
[376:14.32]Is it an NPC?
[376:17.56]No, it's not.
[376:25.88]I swear there was a guy that was just kind of hanging off there.
[376:27.62]Little gravestone guy.
[376:40.67]I already killed this dude.
[376:57.83]You want to get backstabbed?
[376:59.63]I'm sorry, bake-stabbed.
[377:00.74]Anybody up here?
[377:17.07]Hello?
[377:19.81]Hello?
[377:20.77]Oh well.
[377:33.99]I'm just scoping out people to kill.
[377:35.49]Alright.
[377:41.76]I think that's going to be it for me for today.
[377:43.20]This guy already died, so I can't kill him again.
[378:02.69]um alright so now spoilers and all that shit's done with pretty much what uh what was the other area that I didn't go to should I just do it again like a second playthrough I have a sorcerer that I'm I like just started now let's go take a look at that guy I want to look at him
[378:30.75]Uh, can I load from here or do I have to exit from here?
[378:39.34]Leave.
[378:43.12]Let's quit game.
[378:47.04]I'm gonna show you guys my sorcerer.
[378:50.35]Well, there you go.
[378:51.05]There's my completion time.
[378:52.23]26... 2630, I would say.
[378:55.67]Or 26, like, 30-something.
[378:57.21]Because I've just been dicking around for 10-15 minutes.
[379:11.36]You need to cut the bridge down.
[379:19.19]Show your face.
[379:20.21]I'm going to go with Majesto.
[379:25.32]This guy might be uglier.
[379:27.90]I can't even talk.
[379:50.11]He doesn't have a chin.
[379:51.03]His mouth is here and then nothing.
[379:53.59]Oh yeah, I gotta get a good view.
[379:57.97]Who's worse?
[380:07.85]Look at that.
[380:12.48]He's got like a Three Stooges haircut.
[380:21.96]You wanna see how easy, uh, sorcery is?
[380:24.52]Game crashed.
[380:33.87]Can you guys still hear me?
[380:36.09]I don't know if anybody can hear me.
[380:41.09]But, uh, I think that's it.
[380:51.24]Uh...
[380:58.22]Gabe sucks, huh?
[381:01.89]Okay.
[381:02.69]I can't move.
[381:04.50]If I close Dark Souls 3 because it says, oh, Dark Souls 3, stop working.
[381:08.64]The stream's going to end.
[381:09.99]So that's just where I'm going to end it.
[381:16.31]So all you need to know is game sucks.
[381:20.40]Thanks for coming out, guys.
[381:22.10]Thanks for dealing with my rage.
[381:24.94]It held no bounds, apparently.
[381:27.66]But I would say I would highly recommend Dark Souls 3, especially if you want to be challenged because this game was brutal.
[381:36.22]Brutal.
[381:40.01]It was at least four or five areas in the game that were just totally brutal.
[381:45.44]So, uh, yeah, I recommend it.
[381:48.40]I think it's fun.
[381:49.12]It's definitely great.
[381:50.18]It's, uh, what I want for sure.
[381:51.52]I'm going to be playing through it again with my sorcerer.
[381:55.89]So, I don't know if I'm going to stream it.
[381:57.67]I might.
[381:58.25]I kind of maybe want to do one playthrough where I just kind of chill and play the game.
[382:03.93]We'll see.
[382:06.39]But, uh, yeah.
[382:07.05]Much love, guys.
[382:08.33]I missed at least four or five subs because of the last boss there, but thank you regardless.
[382:14.42]I'm, uh,
[382:16.55]Glad to be here.
[382:18.48]What?
[382:21.18]This is like a college commencement speech.
[382:24.31]I just want to say that I'm glad to be here on your commencement day, your high school graduation.
[382:31.57]I don't know.
[382:31.93]Take it easy, guys.
[382:32.87]Thanks so much.
[382:33.97]I hope I have a video done in the next day or two because now that I've beaten the game, I can kind of prioritize that rather than Dark Souls 3.
[382:41.95]So much love.
[382:43.59]Goodbye.
[382:43.95]Good night.
[382:44.57]Thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[382:46.55]And I'll catch you all later.
[382:48.05]Peace, love, and respect.
[382:51.74]And now I'm going to go piss.
[382:53.74]Another scream piss.
[382:55.68]Good night.
