[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.26]I know, I'm sorry.
[00:05.28]I know it's like 3.51 pacific time.
[00:08.64]I fucking fell asleep.
[00:11.50]I took a nap.
[00:13.48]I got up, I went back to bed.
[00:14.85]And you know when you just, sometimes you just take a nap.
[00:20.53]And then, now everything turns off.
[00:24.05]Your brain, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, it all just shuts off.
[00:30.31]I rolled around and it's like, oh, it's like, it's like 3.10.
[00:32.83]It's like, oh.
[00:36.63]What, oh, okay.
[00:38.83]Gotta get the fuck out of this bed!
[00:42.40]So, sorry guys.
[00:45.88]Can't stay awake for more than an hour?
[00:47.50]No.
[00:48.38]God.
[00:48.70]4pm, time to go to bed.
[00:57.30]But anyways, there are some very, very fun things.
[01:01.83]The reason why my sleep schedule is so screwed up is because I was in the Discord a couple days ago, or yesterday morning, because I had stayed up and I was getting all kinds of cool shit ready.
[01:16.31]I got like the sometimes I just get the itch like once every couple weeks or so to just I want to have like a notepad and I want to find out like some fun things to do on stream and that's what I did I was in the Discord at like six or seven o'clock in the morning pacific talking just like oh hey so here's like some fun things people are just like what the fuck are you doing it's like oh yeah I'm good nothing I fell asleep
[01:46.82]But we're gonna play Dragon's Dogma.
[01:49.36]It's one of the things.
[01:51.36]Also expect a Dreamcast conversation here in about two seconds.
[01:58.57]Just about two seconds, once we get into the menu of Dragon's Dogma.
[02:04.03]And I think a lot of people are not gonna like the Dreamcast conversation.
[02:08.19]Because I didn't realize a handful of things about this system.
[02:11.71]Two very important things.
[02:15.80]Important thing number one.
[02:18.20]A majority of the popular releases for the Dreamcast have been ported to PC and upgraded.
[02:27.69]We're talking about Shenmue, Space Channel 5, Nights, Crazy Taxi, they're all on PC.
[02:33.89]So... Oh.
[02:36.91]And they look better?
[02:39.09]They have a higher graphic fidelity?
[02:40.73]Uh-oh.
[02:43.57]Problem number two.
[02:45.61]Actual Dreamcast video games that you would buy on Amazon or eBay, some of them are over $150 each.
[02:54.81]Because apparently the Dreamcast collectors, it's a pretty big deal because they're pretty rare.
[03:00.22]So, most of the good, good Dreamcast games that you can't get on PC that you can only get on Dreamcast, a majority of them are over $50 to $75.
[03:17.11]Emulation is an option, but here's why I don't like emulating anything past PlayStation 1.
[03:23.93]Every time, I always have some kind of problem.
[03:27.21]Either it doesn't capture well, frame rate problems, crashes, I... Every time.
[03:34.41]The post-PlayStation 1 era of emulators, I always have an issue with them.
[03:39.73]So, what I did is I went ahead and I bought them.
[03:44.61]I bought a bunch of Dreamcast games.
[03:48.35]I had in the closet back there already.
[03:54.57]I didn't buy, look, I didn't buy any of like the $150 ones, like the ones that are like $125 each.
[03:59.32]No.
[04:02.68]But the Dreamcast is going to be one of those scenarios where we don't just, oh hey, remember PlayStation 3?
[04:11.30]It has like 60 fucking games.
[04:13.54]That's not going to happen.
[04:15.32]There will be, like, ten fun Dreamcast games, and I'm not just gonna burn through them.
[04:22.45]I'm gonna play them.
[04:25.71]There are a couple of survival horror games that are only on the Dreamcast that I think would be really fun to see.
[04:32.29]There are a couple of fighting games.
[04:33.53]Power Stone is on the Dreamcast, and it's a ton of fun.
[04:36.84]I'm not just gonna play it for five minutes, like we did some of the other PlayStation 2, PlayStation 1 games.
[04:42.22]Seaman, yes.
[04:43.86]The microphone.
[04:44.98]And by the way, you wanna talk about expensive?
[04:50.77]The Seaman microphone is almost a hundred dollars.
[04:55.63]The Dreamcast microphone, it's like a piece of plastic with like a bird shit on the top of it.
[05:02.76]And you stick it into the VMU thing and it's like 70 fucking dollars.
[05:09.81]Why?
[05:10.23]Are people really collecting that?
[05:16.76]And there's no other way to get it to work.
[05:19.25]You have to use it.
[05:21.05]And speaking of which...
[05:23.29]One of the... There's a highly requested game that I've been seeing in the recommendation channel.
[05:28.60]People have said it to me over the course of the last couple of years.
[05:31.08]I'm finally gonna play it.
[05:32.42]I bought it.
[05:33.00]I bought all the necessary stuff to make sure it actually works.
[05:36.16]I'm gonna play Lifeline for PlayStation 2.
[05:39.14]And we're gonna try to beat that whole game.
[05:40.91]That's also coming up here.
[05:41.83]If you don't know what that is, that is a... It's a game where you control the whole thing with your voice.
[05:55.18]Good luck with a Boston accent.
[05:58.16]Well, as you can see, I can get rid of my accent very quickly and very easily.
[06:05.41]And the tone of my voice, I can do a standard speaking voice.
[06:11.55]So it should be able to pick up all of the... It should be able to pick up all of the things I am saying.
[06:22.85]Hey, take a look at that.
[06:24.19]There's, uh, there's Dragon's Dogma.
[06:27.07]Oops.
[06:28.29]Why is it not there?
[06:30.97]Okay, now it is.
[06:35.62]Dragon's Dogma, uh, this was another one of those that was on the list for a long time.
[06:41.50]And I figured it's time to start to play some of the games on the list.
[06:48.00]Also, also, he's been doing research for like two days.
[06:54.01]Dark Souls 3.
[06:54.55]I'm going to play Dark Souls 3 again at some point over the next week or so.
[06:58.65]Well, who cares?
[06:59.91]Dark Souls 3.
[07:01.01]You beat that game like twice on stream.
[07:03.19]I know I beat the game on stream twice on stream.
[07:06.15]We're going to do mods.
[07:07.28]First person mod comes to mind.
[07:10.62]I really want to see how that game is in first person.
[07:12.92]So that's what we're going to do.
[07:22.79]We also got all the Dreamcast.
[07:24.33]We got Shenmue.
[07:25.86]Shenmue is... I got it on PC.
[07:28.12]We've got Crazy Taxi.
[07:29.60]I got like a bunch of shit ready to go now.
[07:37.87]All the Dreamcast games.
[07:39.19]I've got like ten of them.
[07:40.13]Let's see if we can get that started maybe tomorrow.
[07:43.81]Like I guaranteed.
[07:46.96]Wait, what are we doing?
[07:49.02]What even is this game?
[07:50.38]Okay, quest log.
[07:52.02]Using a lantern will hold darkness at bay.
[07:53.50]Press back to open your inventory.
[07:57.16]Okay, so there's a... Items that restore health and stamina.
[08:01.86]Okay, where's my lantern?
[08:04.90]Oh, is that the lantern right there?
[08:09.69]Oh, there it is.
[08:11.39]It's .60 cents, a small light source.
[08:14.01]Let's go ahead and use it.
[08:18.00]Changed the game, I did.
[08:20.38]Wait, does it still say I'm playing Celeste?
[08:24.85]Wait, wait, what is it?
[08:26.57]Because it says Dragon's Dogma for me.
[08:29.99]Yeah?
[08:30.53]What?
[08:35.37]It says Dragon's Dogma.
[08:39.12]What the fuck?
[08:41.56]Dragon's Dogma, Dark Arism.
[08:42.80]Okay, what if I... Yeah, it's there.
[08:45.00]Refresh your page.
[08:46.76]You gotta refresh.
[08:55.28]Oh, oh, we got a one-guy scenario, okay.
[08:59.16]Alright, alright, alright, I get it, yeah.
[09:05.69]Sorry.
[09:10.77]Alright, so, what did I do?
[09:12.01]I just hit press start.
[09:15.40]Press start, who is calling me?
[09:16.82]I forgot, I did the... Am I on the Truman Show?
[09:19.68]No.
[09:21.29]Cause every time I, it's like I start streaming and then, hey, you got a phone call.
[09:27.03]It's like, I've been, I was sleeping.
[09:30.39]I was sleeping for like six hours.
[09:33.39]Call me when I'm sleeping and I'll answer it.
[09:38.43]Alright, so this is a status, got options, saving quick, is it quick saving I'm assuming?
[09:46.22]Six hour nap.

[11:30.47]That's the dragon.
[11:33.61]You're not even flinching, it doesn't even matter.
[11:39.28]Shouldn't we be a little more scared of this?
[11:47.85]I'm so confused.
[11:48.57]This guy has some balls.
[11:50.59]A fire-breathing dragon just landed.
[11:52.87]Screamed at him.
[12:10.20]Breathe Fire blew up a building in front of him, and he was still doing the default walk.
[12:16.50]Some ledges may be scaled, but Long Fall will end in injury or death.
[12:24.39]Alright, well, I'm fine.
[12:28.70]Invoking this stone can gain you new allies, known as Pawns, whose... That was very fast.
[12:35.78]Lucky is the Pawn able to fight at the Arisen side.
[12:38.71]I am thankful.
[12:39.77]A gateway to the rift.
[12:41.45]Here.
[12:42.55]Arisen.
[12:43.35]Go and touch that stone.
[12:44.45]Okay.
[12:46.73]Examine.
[12:48.69]This is a rift stone.
[12:49.67]A stone etched with a strange marking and may be used to summon pawns from beyond.
[12:55.90]This is like a game show?
[12:56.84]Do I have to pick one of these two?
[13:00.72]As you progress in your adventures, pawns will provide you with useful information and hints.
[13:08.21]He's like, let's go, come on, hurry up, dude!
[13:11.71]This is just a tutorial.
[13:17.28]Basic orders.

[13:18.38]Is that me talking?
[13:19.46]Okay, so we got a healer, we have a bow and arrow, and we have shield and sword.
[13:35.25]Alright, a goblin!
[13:40.63]Do I even have to do anything?
[13:48.96]Can I just watch them play?
[13:51.04]Wait, okay, hold on.
[13:51.98]I need to pay attention.
[13:52.92]Press right trigger to pick up items, people, or enemies.
[13:57.68]You can restrain or throw targets.
[13:59.28]Press right trigger again.
[14:04.85]I got to kind of pull Nelson.
[14:07.59]Oh, I see.
[14:09.73]Okay.
[14:12.13]So... Okay, this is going to be a lot of fun.

[14:43.92]Oh man, why did I have to be asleep?
[14:45.94]Holy fuck, why does he have 40,000 gold?
[14:58.72]You can dash by clicking LS, both during and outside of combat.
[15:02.48]Okay.
[15:02.76]I think I'm gonna change that.
[15:05.24]I wanna grab him!
[15:05.84]Alright, let's like... Do it!
[15:07.24]Hurt him!
[15:07.58]Kill this guy!
[15:08.18]Kill this one!
[15:29.01]Kill this guy.
[15:29.75]Please.
[15:30.11]Will you kill this guy?
[15:30.83]I don't even know who you are.
[15:32.29]Oh, he's already dead.
[15:38.31]Alright.
[15:38.71]Come!
[15:39.07]Let's go!
[15:39.51]Here they are!
[15:48.47]Skippy.
[15:56.94]What fucking witch was that?
[15:59.36]Oh, left bumper or right bumper is a weapon skill.
[16:10.11]Where's he going?
[16:10.57]Where'd you go?
[16:11.25]Alright, come here.
[16:12.19]So, uh, Hindsight Slash.
[16:16.09]Okay.
[16:24.59]Shield Summons.
[16:26.83]Oh, there's so many.
[16:27.83]Blink, Strike, Skyward Flash.
[16:29.67]Okay, this is a... Hold on, hold on.
[16:31.79]This is fucking cool.
[16:34.39]Is there a lock-on that I missed here?
[16:36.39]Okay.
[16:53.96]Oh, wait.
[16:54.34]Now you're doing the thing I was just doing.
[16:57.15]I get you.
[16:57.67]Thank you.
[16:58.01]I do like moves.
[17:00.35]Anything else?
[17:00.79]What's this?
[17:23.57]Alright, I've come to realize I'm the useless party member.
[17:31.99]I'm the NPC that's just grabbing random things.
[17:37.76]I still have money, though.
[17:39.24]Where's the money?
[17:43.42]Don't call me useless anymore!
[17:48.93]Do I get to pick my class?
[17:49.77]This is probably, this is the very beginning, right?
[17:51.23]This is probably the joke beginning.
[17:52.81]And by joke, this is... That was fucking terrible.
[18:08.47]I feel bad.
[18:09.33]Good guys?
[18:12.35]Bad guys?
[18:12.89]Alright, I got it.
[18:14.75]Don't worry.
[18:15.47]I'll hold them.
[18:16.33]What?
[18:16.59]Shit.
[18:16.77]Sorry.
[18:33.86]I'm the little brother that got invited to play with the older brother and a couple of his friends.
[18:39.96]Our goal is ahead.
[18:44.83]Let's hasten to the dragon's roost.
[18:46.63]Alright, hold on.
[18:47.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[18:47.79]Are there any secrets?
[19:00.01]Our goal is ahead.
[19:03.32]That's a pretty good secret.
[19:04.86]The worm?
[19:07.24]The worm.
[19:07.68]Okay.
[19:07.78]Well, stealth is not our strong suit.
[19:09.99]Okay.
[19:35.06]I know what's going to happen.
[19:35.72]We're all going to die.
[19:38.34]Oh, shit.
[19:39.68]It's a Chimera!
[19:42.48]No, Sir Pallavi!
[19:43.96]Oh my god!
[19:51.22]Is he alive?
[19:52.24]Alright, here we go.
[19:56.56]I'll grab him!
[20:01.52]What am I doing?
[20:08.99]I really am so useless.
[20:13.15]I've got him on the tail!
[20:14.62]I've got him!
[20:15.60]Alright, so cut the tail off.
[20:17.40]What's a dash?
[20:20.36]Is there like an actual dog roll?
[20:22.42]Is it just Shadow of the Colossus?
[20:40.49]Get back over to the snake.
[20:42.01]No, don't get on the goat head.
[20:43.23]Oh my god.
[20:43.95]Tame it.
[20:45.03]Is it blocking?
[21:03.37]I'm gonna miss this at the kill.
[21:04.39]There's no, like, secret gimmick.
[21:10.24]That is poison.
[21:11.88]Linus.
[21:12.14]Everyone's dying.
[21:12.74]Icon's al-
[21:28.92]I'm getting on top and I'm hitting him in the head again.
[21:42.43]Right in the goat head.
[21:44.51]What?
[21:47.99]You're not gonna hold him still.
[21:50.43]I just... Look, let's all hold him.
[22:03.23]Not even a half health.
[22:05.83]Alright, get rid of the tail!
[22:07.88]You must kill the tail!
[22:25.15]Alright, right in the belly.
[22:26.69]Right in the head.
[22:56.90]Well, I'm the party tank!
[22:58.62]I'll seal its magic, I'm dead.
[23:01.45]Totet's almost dead.
[23:04.45]I'm gonna climb up.
[23:24.03]No, Goat's head has been killed.
[23:26.98]Get me up there.
[23:29.44]No, get up!
[23:30.96]This is a blind space.
[23:32.16]We're just, like, blinded.
[23:45.52]I'll hold it!
[23:46.86]Continue the attack!
[23:48.39]Alright, so I save you.
[23:55.23]This is actually an all-star manner.
[23:57.27]It kind of is.
[23:59.77]Slay the lion!
[24:02.21]Continue its physical attack!
[24:03.83]I am great!
[24:06.83]This is just Monster Hunter, but you don't have friends.
[24:09.73]You know what I mean?
[24:16.43]There are no, wait, is there online?
[24:29.51]Alright, alright, alright.
[24:30.67]John, John, I think you got him.
[24:31.87]Jesus.
[24:32.79]Somebody grab him and shake him.
[24:38.23]Here we go.
[24:49.12]I feel like I'm at the end of the game.
[24:54.26]There's an MMO version of this game in Japan only.
[24:59.85]I told you that was going to happen.
[25:01.61]And countless lifetimes come to pass.
[25:04.17]This is where I get to make my character.
[25:05.33]I'm going to be a wizard.
[25:11.39]That was by Unready Regional.
[25:30.87]Uh-oh.
[25:31.51]The hell portal has opened.
[25:37.44]Didn't even get to meet the dragon.
[25:44.90]Quick, get the tail!
[25:46.74]Are all the birds gonna be yelling random lines at each other?
[25:51.21]His skin is like armor!
[25:54.49]Go for the tail!
[26:02.27]What?
[26:02.87]What's it doing?
[26:11.68]Is that what a meteor looks like?
[26:12.80]Oh, it's a dragon meteor.
[26:14.94]I get it.
[26:25.16]I was just trying to do a cannonball and you fucking birds got in the way.
[26:28.16]I was gonna get a den at a den.
[26:35.20]New Smash character.

[30:11.91]There's too many base bodies.
[30:21.73]Garthord, but you can call me Gene.
[30:24.21]Yeah.
[30:26.63]That's a pretty good Garthord, I would say.
[30:28.27]Yeah, alright.
[30:34.11]That's the base.
[30:38.82]That's just the boomer emote.
[30:41.16]It is not.
[30:42.68]It's like the voice.
[30:43.46]Nope.
[30:45.06]Nope.
[30:50.92]Nope.
[30:52.22]Nope.

[30:54.05]Good.
[30:54.33]This one, I think.

[32:24.12]There we go.
[32:38.22]Like, the beard and the hair...
[32:55.88]It's not literally Gandalf, okay?
[33:11.72]This is... I don't even remember his name.
[33:14.70]Barth?
[33:15.77]What's this guy's name?
[33:20.43]I like this one.
[33:22.39]Hold on, I gotta see more of them.
[33:25.98]Let's go into details here.
[33:29.07]Size.
[33:32.87]No!
[33:42.27]View expressions.
[33:43.86]Steal yourself for combat!
[33:47.18]Steal yourself for combat!
[33:50.60]Oh my goodness.
[33:52.52]Alright, should I make him, uh, like a, should he be like a... green?

[34:00.76]Like undead?
[34:15.31]No, no, no.
[34:15.89]He has to stay... No.
[34:16.43]No, no, no.
[34:17.41]I'm just gonna make him... What if Gandalf... Gandalf looks like this, right?
[34:32.27]Gandalf was not green.
[34:33.38]Alright, face shape.
[34:36.50]Can I do anything else besides the... Okay, eyes.
[34:42.32]Okay, hold on.
[34:42.72]I gotta pick the right ones.
[34:44.16]Oh my god.
[34:53.22]That's fucking terrifying.
[35:06.02]I feel like this is the next John Wick movie.
[35:10.88]You think they're gonna stop at three?
[35:12.86]No.
[35:13.72]They're gonna make a John Wick 4 and it's gonna be when he's like fucking 75.
[35:29.07]Yeah, they better have a blue star wizard robe option or I'm leaving.
[35:32.12]Me too.
[35:33.28]I will exit the game.
[35:38.94]Hmm.
[35:39.64]This is tough.
[35:42.88]Uh, I like... I like these ones.
[35:46.66]No, these ones are way better.
[35:47.84]Those are my actual eyes.
[35:52.81]That's what my visor actually looks like.
[35:54.65]That's kind of scary.
[36:03.23]Okay, vertical spacing.
[36:08.72]Alright.
[36:22.69]No, I'm not gonna make- what's the- what's that movie?
[36:27.56]Uh... Attila?
[36:31.20]No, that's not... No, not Attila.
[36:33.42]I'm not making an Alita character, okay?
[36:38.38]That's gonna be a weird movie to watch.
[36:47.51]No, this is just a bird.
[36:50.61]Yeah, Alita Battle Angel.
[36:52.67]Fine.
[36:54.72]What is a leader's eyes?
[36:55.80]What color does a leader have for eyes?
[36:57.48]Is it red?
[37:11.56]Okay, here we go.
[37:15.36]Looks good.
[37:17.26]Okay, browse.
[37:23.22]That does not fit.
[37:25.56]This is a head transplant.
[37:39.09]Okay, can I do details?
[37:40.15]Yeah, vertical spacing.
[37:47.04]This is gonna be a very, very odd reference, but... Maybe somebody will... Is this Dr. Parnassus?
[37:56.15]Does anybody know who that is?
[37:58.07]From that movie?
[38:07.72]It's a movie that nobody saw, but this is just Dr. Parnassus.
[38:16.24]Okay, that looks good.
[38:22.25]Look at all these pictures.
[38:25.75]These are all so fucked up looking.
[38:35.47]No, no.
[38:36.05]I'm not- No!
[38:36.69]He's not- He's not getting a- He's not getting a cute nose.
[38:40.21]Sorry.
[38:44.27]He has to get like a dwarf nose.
[38:56.63]Actually, I kind of liked it the way it was.
[38:57.79]What do we want?
[39:03.27]Yeah, right there.
[39:08.61]No, like right in the middle.
[39:13.05]Alright, looks good.
[39:15.37]Mouth is important.
[39:25.08]Because what you're looking at here is a crazy grandpa got your iPhone and was taking a selfie, but accidentally, because he's so old, took the shutter take 100 photos button.
[39:45.84]A few details on this one.
[39:54.64]Oh, boy.
[40:01.10]It's not bad.
[40:05.08]I think that's fine.
[40:06.92]Ears.
[40:07.26]You can't even see the ears.
[40:09.00]What?
[40:12.78]No, it's not gonna... It should be... Maybe an elf.
[40:14.50]No.
[40:15.96]Gandalf wasn't an elf.
[40:20.28]Alright.
[40:22.19]Hairstyle.
[40:22.63]Let me look at this one more time.
[40:24.17]Details.
[40:25.05]Okay.
[40:27.25]24 is the right one.
[40:30.43]Or is it?
[40:44.99]Okay.
[40:45.75]Can you give... Can you give... Can you give characters in this game the Sia haircut?
[40:51.74]Is it possible?
[40:54.77]I don't think it is.
[41:07.98]You can change the hair later.
[41:12.68]See ya?
[41:14.58]See ya, haircut?
[41:17.64]No, I don't...
[41:20.55]No.
[41:21.23]No.
[41:22.79]No.
[41:32.09]Alright.
[41:33.13]Just keep going.
[41:35.37]Preset bodies.
[41:51.34]Give him a huge jackpot No, that doesn't work like that He can he can this character can stay in Ren and Stimpy where he belongs My character is gonna be No, that's too easy
[42:25.43]It's too easy to just make, like, a fat guy.
[42:28.41]Or, I'm huge.
[42:29.53]You know what I mean?
[42:31.80]I have to keep him... normal.
[42:35.16]But out of shape normal.
[42:39.36]Wait, I can make it... what?
[42:41.32]Oh, I thought you could change just the color of his, like, chest.
[42:49.71]Okay, that's fine.
[42:52.81]Stature.
[42:54.55]Height.
[43:01.76]No, we're gonna make him normal, okay?
[43:04.48]No, we're not gonna make him huge, we're gonna make him normal.
[43:08.00]141 centimeters is how tall?
[43:15.59]That's what?
[43:19.59]That's four foot nine.
[43:23.83]Is this inches?
[43:27.21]No, that's, we're gonna keep him normal.
[43:29.42]Not small.
[43:32.75]We're gonna keep him in the normal range.
[43:36.71]This is fine.
[43:37.27]This is normal.
[43:38.39]Weight.
[43:38.65]Okay.
[43:44.03]Uh, musculature.
[43:45.05]That's pretty good.
[43:51.73]Torso.
[43:55.67]Now, fucking with the torso fucks with the way you've made his face.
[44:03.41]Although I do really like the coat hanger, though.
[44:06.71]Not realistic.
[44:16.68]We'll go with two.
[44:17.60]Two's fine.
[44:27.72]Alright, should I just make Jack the dad?
[44:32.80]This is jacked dad body.
[44:36.03]You know the guy that's like in his late 40s and can't wait to go to the resort pool to take the shirt off?
[44:42.61]Because he has like really defined shoulders, a fat stomach, and like a big chest.
[44:52.29]Yeah, I think I'm gonna make resort casino dad.
[44:55.43]Yeah.
[44:57.51]I gotta go back to the stomach.
[45:10.94]Where is it?
[45:11.48]Torso?
[45:21.01]No, where was it?
[45:21.81]It was back... Statue?
[45:23.97]Okay, here it is.
[45:28.03]No.
[45:31.37]It needs to be less defined.
[45:40.80]That, that's better.
[45:44.24]There we go.
[45:48.68]Huge fucking arms.
[45:57.77]Although this is, this is pretty good Resort Casino Dad too.
[46:02.65]Because, some, they don't even work out your arms.
[46:05.07]You just do, you just do like curls.
[46:10.67]And then you do like the chest.
[46:12.29]No, this is perfect.
[46:16.87]No, that's much better.
[46:24.60]Not another frog!
[46:26.30]Is he just... He is turning into a frog, isn't he?
[46:30.46]Wicked skinny legs.
[46:32.04]No, I'm not going to do one of the fat ones.
[46:33.50]We'll be doing Kenshi body again.
[46:35.56]No.
[46:38.10]These are good.
[46:40.62]Alright, I'm gonna fix this.
[46:41.42]I'm not doing Kenshi body.
[46:43.14]I promise.
[46:52.47]See?
[46:53.71]I told you I wasn't gonna do Kenshi.
[46:57.63]Stance.
[47:05.02]Mmm.
[47:10.21]No, nobody has posture that good.
[47:11.99]It hurts to have posture like this.
[47:17.25]That's fine.
[47:18.84]Stance.
[47:24.78]Ladylike or macho?
[47:30.99]All I'm doing is lifting my arms up a little.
[47:34.49]And giving myself duck feet.
[47:37.45]How's that a...
[47:44.85]Wanna learn how to be macho?
[47:47.01]Just raise your hands up a couple of degrees above your waist.
[47:51.91]And then pivot your toes.
[47:58.63]Okay.
[48:00.21]And it features scars, wrinkles, facial hair.
[48:02.81]This is actually pretty detailed.
[48:19.66]No, no scars.
[48:20.60]That implies that I may have lost a battle.
[48:23.86]Oh, I haven't even been touched.
[48:24.88]I'm untouchable.
[48:28.15]Nobody can hit me.
[48:33.77]Oh boy, that's... Alright, 23.
[48:39.50]Oh!
[48:45.51]Oh my goodness.
[48:47.33]Oh my goodness.
[48:48.23]I don't... I... No, get the beard back.
[49:04.12]It's the hair.
[49:05.18]It's the hair that's doing that.
[49:15.44]This hair just is so terrible.
[49:20.32]Alright, that's fine.
[49:21.70]The beard we had before was perfect.
[49:27.28]I think that's just enough beard.
[49:28.75]I think.
[49:31.07]What else we got?
[49:31.65]I don't like this character.
[49:44.12]I think this is perfect.
[49:46.70]Wait, hold on.
[49:47.30]Details?
[49:51.16]Alright, so we can do the reverse YouTuber if you want.
[50:04.63]No, no, no, no.
[50:07.77]Look, if you can't dye your hair when you're 75 years old, you can dye your beard.
[50:16.72]Okay.
[50:16.94]I think we're good.
[50:22.44]Makeup.
[50:25.94]Okay.
[50:34.04]I can't really see anything.
[50:36.56]Adjustment.
[50:41.32]Give him a cool scar.
[50:44.30]No, he didn't.
[50:45.32]That implies that I was injured ever in a fight.
[50:48.86]Okay, we got, uh, uh... Garthord.
[50:52.20]Jean Garthord.
[50:53.60]Or Jean.
[50:54.22]Male.
[50:55.20]Type 10.
[50:57.67]This is perfect.
[51:00.73]This is gonna be the best wizard you've ever seen.
[51:05.71]No scars means you didn't fight at all.
[51:07.31]No, no scars means that I have never been hit.
[51:11.55]I'm unhittable.
[51:14.30]You take a gigantic swing, you pull back with all of your might, and you swing straight down, and nope, you're not going to hit me.
[51:19.68]I've never been hit by a blade.
[51:21.46]Or an arrow.
[51:22.44]Or a magical spell.
[51:33.08]Pretty good.
[51:38.44]I'm ready.
[51:41.66]I'm ready to play.
[51:47.32]Yes, I'm ready to play.
[51:50.28]Make him fat.
[51:51.18]No, no, we can't.
[51:52.36]That's the trope we can't go down on this channel.
[51:55.92]If there was like a Jerma trope, it would be character has to be very fat, very small, and very old.
[52:03.67]We have to at least try a different character for once.
[52:06.83]No like old fat guy.
[52:08.63]I'm okay with old small guy.
[52:14.57]We can't do the three strikes.
[52:15.65]That's three strikes.
[52:22.00]Make him too... He's too... He's way too small.
[52:24.42]Is he?
[52:24.66]Didn't... How small did I make him?
[52:30.61]No, I had him, like, get a... Today, like every day, waves gently lapped at the... I didn't even let me read it!
[52:52.94]Is this me?
[52:54.76]I can't wait till they do the camera pan.
[52:56.62]Yep.
[53:00.77]Oh, what a beautiful day.
[53:04.01]In my village.
[53:08.45]Look at that pool over there.
[53:09.59]Nice resort that we're at.
[53:11.24]I can't wait to take my shirt off and go swimming.
[53:15.02]What I do as a dad on vacation.
[53:20.53]And smoke a bunch of cigarettes too, even though I don't even smoke cigarettes.
[53:23.31]I love the voice.
[53:24.61]You guys said I was small.
[53:52.16]I'm not even smoking.
[53:52.98]Look at all these people around me.
[53:55.05]I am as tall as almost everybody here.
[54:01.49]See?
[54:11.68]I towered over that guy.
[54:22.03]I want you to pause that and I want you to put a ruler up on your screen and see how tall I am.
[54:34.10]Again, untouchable.
[54:36.64]He was aiming for me.
[54:38.74]Who's that Marvel character that has so much luck that they can't even get hurt?
[54:45.44]Lucky, what is it?
[54:50.23]Domino.
[54:52.05]There.
[54:52.27]That's my superpower.
[54:55.33]Unable to get hurt.
[55:01.23]Here we go.
[55:19.86]Where is he?
[55:21.24]Where is the human?
[55:28.66]Alright.
[55:38.51]Unhittable.
[55:44.50]I can do whatever I want.
[55:47.74]Nobody fucking hits me.
[55:49.42]Carpored.
[55:57.56]Almost hit- nope, he almost hit me.
[56:05.53]Oh.
[56:08.39]God dammit, my first scar!
[56:12.47]Got me right in the shoulder.
[56:13.57]What the heck?
[56:31.87]Does he know?
[56:33.42]He knows.
[56:33.88]I'm gonna get a whole lot more of these Scars.
[56:58.37]I don't know what you're saying, I'm sorry.
[56:59.67]I don't know if this is what your ancient prophecy is.
[57:03.17]It sounds like Java.
[57:09.78]No!
[57:10.30]My ruin!
[57:15.43]First ever scar.
[57:34.66]No, don't eat it!
[57:36.31]Oh no
[57:55.70]So I get it.
[57:57.30]The dragon ate my heart.
[57:59.44]I have to get my heart back from the dragon.
[58:02.03]So I need a band of adventurers and a band of merry, merry, merry.
[58:06.59]I get it.
[58:19.57]Pretty good Kingdom Hearts opening theme song.
[58:27.25]Where the fuck is Goofy?
[58:28.07]Is Donald gonna show up?
[58:37.74]Scar.
[58:37.92]Goddammit.
[58:38.70]That's a big one.
[58:58.27]Take up arms.
[59:01.34]Fight!
[59:03.12]Fight!
[59:19.25]You're in the chef's house.
[59:20.09]It's time for you to begin your journey as artisan.
[59:23.31]Arisen.
[59:24.23]But before you can win your heart back from the dragon, you'll need to prepare
[59:34.05]Take a weapon.
[59:35.57]Oh, this is where I'm gonna choose my Mickey Mouse path.
[59:40.09]Do you like friends?
[59:42.99]Are you strong?
[59:44.75]Are you smart?
[59:45.81]Here we go.
[59:50.24]Your vocation determines your basic attributes, wieldable equipment, and skills.
[59:54.78]Fighter, Strider, Mage.
[60:02.61]Primary weapon is going to be a two-handed wielding double-bladed axe.
[60:10.07]Alright, basic vocation, a conjurer of magics to heal wounds and target elemental weaknesses.
[60:17.11]Looses a ball of fire that explodes upon contact.
[60:20.57]Invokes a magical sigil which recovers the health of those who enter.
[60:23.49]Okay.
[60:32.52]Let's just do mage.
[60:33.12]We'll go with mage.
[60:33.92]Take on mage as a vocation.
[60:35.42]Well, that's the character I made.
[60:40.50]You can equip yourself with a primary and secondary weapon.
[60:43.88]Primary weapons such as swords and daggers are combat essentials.
[60:46.83]Secondary weapons like bows and shields offer support.
[60:54.15]Did I just air zooka?
[60:58.53]Oh, wow.
[60:59.23]I'm so happy I got to air zooka.
[61:13.84]How do I... What do I do?
[61:18.56]How long does it take to cast?
[61:21.98]Oh.
[61:23.02]Okay.
[61:27.29]That... Okay, so that's how long it takes to cast.
[61:29.97]You can hold it, and then you can target it.
[61:33.99]I get it.
[61:34.89]Okay.
[61:38.97]Oh, you target an area, and then you just stand in it.
[61:41.15]I get it.
[61:41.51]Okay.
[61:41.61]Okay.
[61:44.02]So, air Zuko.
[61:45.66]Fireball.
[61:48.37]And you just release to shoot.
[61:57.59]Okay.
[61:58.49]Let's go.
[62:00.31]They're already talking about it.
[62:02.49]Fuck.
[62:04.52]Yeah, the one thing that he was good at.
[62:07.38]The one thing that he told everybody.
[62:10.32]Not anymore.
[62:11.28]He's a loser now.
[62:16.87]You are sure of this?
[62:19.95]Yes.
[62:20.79]Ill magic.
[62:21.95]The work of some curse.
[62:23.27]The only reason why we thought he was cool was because he was never hit.
[62:26.96]He didn't even have any powers.
[62:29.74]We can't sell that.
[62:30.60]The tourism will drop.
[62:31.68]I must go see to the others, Kina.
[62:36.14]Tell me if Oth changes here.
[62:38.70]Alright.
[62:51.40]Give me some dialog, ugh.
[62:54.76]Quest successful!
[62:57.04]Defeating foes and completing quests earns you experience and each level gained raises all of your attributes.
[63:02.49]Press start to bring up the pause menu where you can check your attributes, a full map, quest information, and more.
[63:09.83]Oh my god!
[63:19.79]Well, hopefully that didn't mess anything up later.
[63:25.26]Kneecafter.
[63:31.34]Look at all these berries and apples and oranges.
[63:39.74]Let's sheet this so I don't get in any more trouble.
[63:45.47]Is it broom?
[63:46.17]Can I pick up the broom?
[63:50.05]Come on.
[63:53.57]What the hell is this even for?
[63:56.66]What can I do with a broom?
[63:57.74]Why did I pick up a broom?
[64:05.24]This is probably heals.
[64:07.36]Who made this?
[64:07.80]Capcom?
[64:08.80]Okay, so those are Resident Evil herbs.
[64:10.97]They have to be.
[64:11.47]Alright, let's go.
[64:24.85]Casardist.
[64:29.51]Progress through the game by completing quests.
[64:32.49]Always talk with the people you meet.
[64:33.81]They'll surely... People who bear an icon above their head possess special information.
[64:39.18]Those bearing green icons have new quests to offer.
[64:44.92]Look at this beautiful world.
[64:46.10]Beautiful game.
[64:51.97]This is why they put this here.
[64:52.99]You come down, you see the fantastic landscape.
[65:16.02]This is awful.
[65:17.38]Worse than I feared.
[65:19.56]Present.
[65:25.53]My thanks.
[65:37.78]This is awful.
[65:51.24]You can't pick people up.
[65:58.13]He didn't like the pie.
[66:00.75]Well, it was a free pie.
[66:02.75]Well, you can't get mad at a free pie.
[66:07.37]Would you get mad if somebody gave you a free pie, no matter what the quality was?
[66:10.47]It could be absolute awful quality.
[66:12.99]But if it was free, then who cares?
[66:16.85]Brine?
[66:17.05]What if somebody gave you a pile of shit?
[66:18.78]Uh... Performing actions that people dislike will decrease their affinity for you.
[66:44.86]This is the guy that wanted the pie, huh?
[66:47.40]This was the pie tutorial.
[66:49.58]Alright, look at the height difference here.
[66:51.54]This guy's like 6'4".
[66:54.57]This is not that small.
[66:57.03]Right?
[66:57.29]This is like... That's not that small.
[67:00.05]If this guy's like 6'1", this... This is like 6 feet versus 5'11".
[67:10.63]I don't know what it is with some of you guys in this chat.
[67:14.47]Anything under like 6'5 is tiny, apparently, to a lot of people here.
[67:20.53]If you're not over like 6'2, apparently you're like a puny, tiny person.
[67:28.36]Where do you guys live?
[67:36.06]Perhaps we're being punished for some ill we've wrought.
[67:43.75]America.
[67:45.07]Purchasing equipment and useful items from shops or wandering merchants you encounter on your travels.
[67:49.05]You can do that.
[67:49.57]Didn't somebody say I had too much money?
[67:53.33]Let's burn it.
[67:57.84]You can restore health and stamina and advance the passage of time at any inn or resting place.
[68:01.68]This game looks... I feel like this game is going to be a lot of fun.
[68:07.94]wait come here come here oh that was a full baseball swing in the face can I use this in ever again it's a false swing oh that would kill somebody is this stealing some items can be combined with others to produce surprising results experiment and see what you can come up with
[68:37.21]A game where you can steal and there's no consequences.
[68:39.19]I already like it.
[68:59.36]I don't know why I'm burning this guy's bed.
[69:00.77]There's no reason for it.
[69:04.43]Tiny pillow.
[69:08.00]Alright, I will agree with you.
[69:09.55]That pillow is very small.
[69:13.07]Okay?
[69:14.67]Do the math though.
[69:15.57]This is a standard bed.
[69:17.49]If I were to lie down in this bed right now.
[69:20.71]So let me line it up so my head would, my head's not gonna touch it.
[69:25.25]Okay, my head would touch that pillow right here.
[69:29.46]Maybe like right here.
[69:30.68]If I lie down straight.
[69:35.12]This bed is huge.
[69:40.64]Look at how big this bed is.
[69:42.45]Nothing to do with how tall the character is.
[69:49.49]Rock.
[69:50.93]Oh, they have Resident Evil crates, too.
[69:53.85]It's an inn.
[69:54.45]Alright.
[69:54.92]There's a stone over here.
[69:56.68]Isn't that one of those wishing stones where I can wish for a friend, wish for, like, an ally?
[70:06.16]Empty flask.
[70:13.70]Okay, let's put this away.
[70:16.90]I just kind of like looking around.
[70:21.38]Your character is 5-2.
[70:22.99]The character's not 5-2!
[70:25.43]It's 5, like, 8.
[70:31.37]Barn.
[70:33.03]Where's this, uh, wish?
[70:33.89]There it is.
[70:34.85]Examine.
[70:36.13]There ought there.
[70:38.33]There's ought there.
[70:41.46]As rot there.
[70:42.48]Was that like a very strong English accent?
[70:56.49]Alright, here's the first combat mission.
[70:58.99]Wow.
[71:09.42]Am I supposed to know who this is?
[71:14.43]He's got a scar, too.
[71:17.74]Wait a minute.
[71:20.10]We were both scarless at one point?
[71:24.66]That's not him.
[71:25.20]They're a strange lot.
[71:37.97]That's gonna be the middle name of my first child.
[71:41.27]Brandon Sellsword Elbertson.
[71:42.67]So you know I'm a fan of Game of Thrones, you know?
[72:09.71]Hmm.
[72:10.69]There's an encampment west of the village where men gather to face the dragon.
[72:17.25]I'd wager a fair number of his kind will be there as well.
[72:22.39]Second Jerma sellsword Elverton.
[72:25.34]I already hate your kid.
[72:29.76]Why don't you take him?
[72:31.80]Might be you learn aught of why he came to you in the first place.
[72:37.40]Before...
[72:39.18]Available quests change as you progress through the game.
[72:41.13]Additionally, you can always consult the quests section of the pause menu for your current objectives.
[72:46.99]People with red icons appearing over their head have information relevant to your priority quest.
[72:52.15]If you have several quests ongoing at the same time, you can set one as priority in the quest section of the pause menu.
[72:57.35]What's going on with the throat today?
[72:58.91]I don't know.
[73:03.54]Doing so will make all people, places, and things relevant to the priority quest appear prominently on your mini-map.
[73:09.11]That's good.
[73:10.41]Pawns in your party will also offer advice for the priority quest more often than for other quests in your log.
[73:17.73]Okay.
[73:20.01]To truly know what a Risen are meant to do, tis likely best to follow the pawn's lead.
[73:24.77]But you've got information for me.
[73:25.84]Head west.
[73:26.18]Ah, fuck!
[73:26.72]Okay.
[73:38.10]He's following me.
[73:38.62]Why not see that pawn to the encampment?
[73:41.06]Might be you'll find art there as well.
[73:45.20]My thanks.
[73:46.72]Here, have a knife.
[73:50.00]This guy didn't even introduce himself.
[73:51.70]Purchasing equipment here in Cassidus will make for a safer trip to the encampment.
[74:04.24]Sell or...
[74:08.51]Where's the... Where do you buy?
[74:15.84]Is there, like, a general store?
[74:25.29]Wait, hold on, hold on.
[74:26.21]Can I put him in the well?
[74:31.19]This is not possible, right?
[74:34.27]Oh, it's boarded up.
[74:35.07]God damn it.
[74:41.93]Why do they give you this kind of power?
[74:46.49]He's slapping your butt.
[74:58.22]Why am I doing this?
[74:59.00]There's no point in what I'm doing.
[75:07.28]This is not gonna even do anything.
[75:11.07]He comes back, right?
[75:11.91]That guy comes back.
[75:43.74]He doesn't respawn.
[75:44.62]There's no, oh, your companion respawned.
[75:49.52]Actually gone forever.
[75:59.43]The game has permadeath.
[76:10.54]So, that guy actually is gone forever.
[76:17.85]Fuck him, I don't need him.
[76:30.36]Oh my god, can I just get a new one?
[76:31.54]Is this the- is this the purchased-a-guy vending machine?
[76:38.53]Come on, I need another person.
[76:47.35]Fuck.
[76:47.87]Okay.
[76:49.75]Well, I'm gonna listen to his advice, and I'm gonna buy some supplies.
[76:55.35]Who gives a shit about that guy?
[77:00.19]That guy wasn't gonna do anything anyways.
[77:07.42]This game's fucking cool.
[77:10.62]Why did it take me so long to play this game?
[77:13.28]This game is fucking interesting.
[77:14.78]Wait, lantern.
[77:16.11]Lantern.
[77:19.37]No, get the lantern, not the empty flask!
[77:22.05]What am I even picking up?
[77:33.46]You already have one.
[77:36.78]This is not a lethal fall, right?
[77:38.52]Is it?
[77:38.82]I don't know.
[77:39.54]I'm just gonna climb.
[77:48.43]No, that's not lethal at all.
[77:49.35]Alright.
[77:51.32]Let's take a look at the map.
[77:53.48]After accepting a quest, first note the quest marker on your map, then continue by searching for the quest- That guy's actually gone.
[77:58.34]Is this like a joke that people are doing, by the way?
[78:00.48]Or is this- He's actually gone forever.
[78:03.40]This permanent death.
[78:07.24]Okay.
[78:10.52]Quest markers will be- If you want to progress through another-
[78:16.43]You may find a solution in your initial problem.
[78:18.31]Okay.
[78:18.69]So where's the shop?
[78:22.60]Pablo's Inn, Riftstone.
[78:25.20]What about this is?
[78:26.96]Barn.
[78:29.95]Is it the inn?
[78:32.21]Did I permadeath that guy too?
[78:48.07]Alright, now that I know that there's... Okay, grocery store.
[78:57.94]Thanks for the groceries.
[78:59.76]There's nobody here.
[79:01.46]Steal from register.
[79:02.66]Wherever the register is.
[79:03.54]Okay, I got it.
[79:06.35]Okay, I'm just taking all this guy's money.
[79:16.23]Let's fuck the whole place up.
[79:17.69]You know what I mean?
[79:27.24]Oh, never mind.
[79:32.21]Is he- he sleeps?
[79:33.63]Oh, fisherman's house.
[79:38.25]What the- I just- did I just put a fairy in there?
[79:40.91]Oh, this is not Legend of Zelda.
[79:44.30]Flask of oil.
[80:01.54]Okay, I'm telling you guys, I'm feeling it.
[80:03.78]I'm feeling the bug from this game.
[80:06.66]Yeah, sometimes you can just tell.
[80:07.70]I can just tell.
[80:12.81]I like this game a lot, and I haven't even played it for like five minutes.
[80:15.99]Actually, I played for... What?
[80:17.31]How long has it been?
[80:18.07]An hour and 20 minutes?
[80:21.05]No, it has not been an hour and 21 minutes.
[80:23.29]That's how you can tell that I think the game is fun.
[80:26.45]I thought it was like seven minutes ago is when I turned the stream on.
[80:32.22]Why not see that pawn to the encampment?
[80:34.38]Well, he's dead.
[80:34.96]Can you come with me instead?
[80:37.64]I need, like, a shop.
[80:38.86]Here we go.
[80:39.76]Oh, hello.
[80:41.74]Hello.
[80:42.74]It's a mercy.
[80:43.59]So much of the village was spared.
[80:45.63]I only wish I had more to offer.
[80:47.29]Okay, curatives.
[80:50.39]Tools.
[80:53.41]Ah.
[80:54.23]How much is this stuff?
[80:56.02]It's overwhelming.
[80:56.70]Okay, do I need an axe?
[81:02.10]No, I'm not going to baseball swing her in the face with my fucking walking stick.
[81:07.84]What do we got for armor?
[81:10.20]Leather cap, traveler's hood.
[81:20.13]How much is it?
[81:20.57]What does this do for... A feathered leather cap thick enough to protect the head from mishaps.
[81:30.44]Vocation, magic defense, defense.
[81:33.93]Wow, what does it even look like?
[81:39.13]Oh, it's on there now.
[81:40.35]Okay, I thought that was my hair.
[81:42.03]This thing is so stupid.
[81:43.13]This is made out of like newspaper.
[81:50.88]Wait, do I add it to cart like it's Amazon?
[81:55.20]I do.
[81:56.34]Why don't more games do that?
[81:57.65]How long, when did this fucking game come out?
[82:00.44]The add this item to cart and then check your cart out.
[82:04.18]You gotta be kidding me.
[82:10.25]Why do... Is this not in other games?
[82:12.15]Alright, let's see.

[82:23.85]This one's not bad.
[82:24.61]This one's expensive though.
[82:25.39]I don't have enough money.
[82:29.47]Maybe just get a shirt and a hat?
[82:33.61]I think that's what I'm gonna do.
[82:34.45]Let's take a look at the checkout.
[82:35.43]Cap and hat.
[82:37.77]I got plenty of money.
[82:39.31]Okay.

[85:35.75]A pleb shirt, really.
[85:48.18]Traveler's tights.
[85:51.20]And I'm gonna sell the rest.
[85:55.45]So let's sell.
[85:59.75]What about a rock?
[86:02.15]Wait, you can throw the rocks.
[86:03.07]Never mind.
[86:06.29]Didn't I steal a bunch of shit from somebody's house?
[86:12.19]Yeah, just take that.
[86:15.67]Herb.
[86:17.55]Bucket.
[86:17.87]Yeah, see?
[86:18.25]Look.
[86:18.41]I don't want this stuff.
[86:20.90]I just took it to sell it.
[86:22.58]Rusted staff.
[86:23.54]Get rid of it.
[86:27.71]I wonder if this... Does this shit matter?
[86:31.56]This doesn't, like, improve your fishing by, like, 5%, right?
[86:41.58]You know, some games have that kind of shit.
[86:43.24]You have to wear... If you wear the full set of fisherman's outfit, your lore is better.
[86:47.60]Alright, let's go.
[86:52.86]Uh, yep.
[86:57.82]Didn't I have something else, too?
[87:02.75]Item storage.
[87:05.97]Whose is this?
[87:07.35]Item storage.
[87:15.25]What?
[87:15.87]This is my stuff?
[87:27.84]How is this my stuff?
[87:29.42]Why is it $2,600 to take my stuff out of storage?
[87:37.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[87:38.09]This is selling.
[87:40.65]312,000 gold?
[87:44.23]Wait.
[87:47.53]Why is this like this?
[87:53.43]Why does this stuff exist?
[87:59.01]This is the DLC stuff.
[88:06.25]That's kind of unfair.
[88:08.03]I could give myself like more than a quarter of a million dollars right now.
[88:13.20]More than that.
[88:13.76]How do I pull it out?
[88:17.16]Buy.
[88:33.61]This shit ain't even in here.
[88:39.19]What the fuck is all this stuff?
[88:43.14]I need to go to the inn to get it out.
[88:44.68]No, I don't want to do that.
[88:45.68]That's cheating.
[88:46.26]I'm just going to pretend those don't exist.
[88:53.72]I'm ready to go on my adventure.
[88:55.26]But I need to... Go to my equipment.
[89:00.00]Alright, how do I...
[89:07.88]Is there like a certain way I can heal?
[89:09.65]Alright, can I touch the stone?
[89:23.54]No.
[89:24.02]It's gonna go.
[89:24.64]I'm going, and I'm gonna be ready, and I'm gonna fucking attack.
[89:30.02]Herbs and spells.
[89:31.34]Assign items to buttons.
[89:36.16]Where do I do that?
[89:37.92]Status?
[89:38.88]Map?
[89:39.24]Options?
[89:39.58]Status?
[89:41.72]Skills.
[89:43.30]Okay, here we go, hold on.
[89:45.44]So I have to heal.
[89:51.62]Condition... Oh, okay, here we go.
[90:01.10]So this is a common herb used in preparing consumable... Okay, it's sort or...
[90:08.39]how do I put this use combine I can't combine with how do I how do I hotkey it is there a way I can make this on the hotkey because I just have to use you can't set shortcuts for items okay you can only hockey it on the keyboard oh
[90:42.26]Finally, you set up for... Permanently dead, huh?
[90:50.20]Permanently dead!
[90:54.91]He's back.
[90:56.95]Game saves automatically.
[90:58.17]You can also save manually.
[90:59.45]Alright.
[91:07.23]I will heal you.
[91:15.34]Come here!
[91:17.04]I just tried to heal you.
[91:22.08]Will you let me do this, please?
[91:25.74]Right there.
[91:29.74]Alright, just hang out in there for a second.
[91:38.74]This is a very slow heal.
[91:39.94]Throw him off the cliff.
[91:49.05]I'm not gonna throw this guy off the cliff.
[91:54.05]Uh oh, goblins.
[91:55.79]Save the peddler!
[92:00.13]Attack while holding, you have weapon skills, you can dash.
[92:03.92]Yes, I know how to dash.
[92:04.74]Got him.
[92:16.54]If Pawn possesses the right knowledge and skills, they may be able to assist in tandem attacks.
[92:26.18]Get out of the way!
[92:28.24]Get out of the way!
[92:30.64]Oh, wait a minute!
[92:31.26]Hold on.
[92:32.06]Why am I... Why are my things on fire?
[92:38.31]My air is on fire.
[92:46.41]When foes seem to be too much to handle, try gaining levels or obtaining better equipment.
[92:51.34]Is this guy going to give us money?
[92:52.34]Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[92:54.32]You just gnomed that guy and he ran away.
[92:56.72]I can't even attack that guy now.
[93:19.01]They often come across rare items not found at stationery shops.
[93:22.51]If you see a peddler, make sure to check what they have to offer.
[93:28.17]Um, well, I can't do that anymore.
[93:31.69]Thanks.
[93:32.23]Thanks, guy.
[93:39.54]Gob.
[93:41.08]Gob!
[93:41.42]Alright, let's check this place out.
[93:49.25]Empty flask.
[93:50.03]Nothing?
[93:50.39]I don't have any.
[93:51.35]Alright, so we can go up.
[93:56.22]What about down here?
[93:58.44]No, that's just fall off.
[94:00.98]Right.
[94:02.32]Are we gonna fall off?
[94:03.52]If we go down here?
[94:06.12]What was that?
[94:06.46]No, give me that.
[94:08.48]Why are you picking the rocks up?
[94:09.84]Stop.
[94:10.04]That's my stuff.
[94:21.33]A wealth of useful items can be found by vanquishing monsters.
[94:25.48]Get the fuck out of here!
[94:26.62]That's mine!
[94:30.40]Just fighting over fucking mines again in veins like in Warcraft.
[94:33.48]What's this?
[94:40.16]You can use materials.
[94:41.68]Let's just keep going.
[94:44.05]Time for him to throw them off the cliff.
[94:45.39]No, I'm not gonna throw them off the cliff.
[94:48.24]He's too useful for me right now.
[94:50.64]Not yet.
[94:50.96]Search the log.
[94:51.30]Cedar bridge.
[94:51.76]Small nut.
[95:18.13]Did you just skin a tree?
[95:19.23]I guess I could just sprint.
[95:23.82]I want to change that to something else, a different button.
[95:26.50]What can I make that?
[95:27.18]Hmm, I'm not sure I can make it anything.
[95:30.66]I don't like pushing left stick in.
[95:37.72]What do you- why did you do that?
[95:39.84]What the fuck did you do that for?
[95:44.40]What is he doing?
[95:45.14]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[95:52.81]I'm not like this, I'm like a player, right?
[96:00.66]No, I'm not gonna throw him up.
[96:02.70]What are you doing?
[96:10.82]We both keep having the same idea.
[96:14.39]Yeah, the Vandal Brothers.
[96:23.42]Silence of arrows.
[96:24.76]Cool.
[96:26.16]Alright, we gotta convince them to let us in.
[96:28.20]Alright, we got front door.
[96:30.06]We got back door.
[96:30.68]Are we allowed in here?
[96:31.35]What the hell?
[96:35.17]Alright.
[96:52.78]So somebody's speaking out of the Riftstone?
[96:54.72]That was the Wendy's girl.
[97:14.26]That was a good one.
[97:19.20]So they can learn, this is where you can learn new skills.
[97:22.06]Rest with 300 gold.
[97:22.96]Hold on, let me see.
[97:23.68]Learn skills.
[97:24.46]Alright, I need 200 discipline.
[97:44.63]Fire Boon.
[97:46.87]Thunder Boon.
[97:48.17]I think I want to be Electricity.
[97:49.31]What was Gandalf?
[97:52.85]Nothing.
[97:55.57]I don't think, did Gandalf ever do a spell?
[97:58.65]He did like a light, big thing of bright lights for like one second.
[98:04.06]He didn't have any ice moves, didn't have any fucking fireballs, wasn't even a good wizard.
[98:13.14]Yeah, he did the You Shall Not Pass.
[98:14.32]It makes like a big bright light.
[98:18.10]He was a light wizard.
[98:19.10]Well, I can't do anything yet, so... He made fireworks.
[98:29.20]Alright, let's get it.
[98:37.37]Well, Mantor Wizard, can you hear our voice?
[98:46.16]There's the funny joke where Jerma says dumb things about things he doesn't know.
[98:50.72]I'm like dead serious.
[98:54.74]What did Gandalf have for spells?
[98:58.12]He did like bright lights and could kind of crash through sides, right?
[99:11.87]He did do fire at one point?
[99:14.42]We could do like a big push here, like a wind, right?
[99:19.32]We speak to you from across great distance.
[99:22.43]The Pawn Legion has awaited you.
[99:29.79]What does Goku do besides bright lights?
[99:32.10]That's a good point.
[99:33.58]Pray, forgive this strange and impersonal greeting.
[99:41.52]So I can make another character?
[99:48.91]There was a theory that he only used as much magic as level 2 wizard in Dungeons & Dragons.
[99:53.25]That makes sense.
[99:55.70]For they possess a will powerful enough to guide the Legion.
[100:00.16]If you would claim to be among the Arisen, prove the strength of your resolve.
[100:06.08]Very well.
[100:07.50]If you are an Arisen in truth, the Arisen must possess the valor to stand against all threats and the power to quell them.
[100:15.74]A tireless spirit of self-improvement grants the strength to lead the Legion.
[100:21.42]Pray.
[100:22.38]Show it now.
[100:23.80]Gandalf was much more powerful than he let on.
[100:25.72]His job was to guide the people of Middle-Earth, not do everything for them, you uncultured swine!
[100:35.69]Alright, search the area.
[100:50.73]My kind grows better able to serve the more we learn.
[100:57.47]So what did one of these... Sorry, I was having a Lord of the Rings argument in chat.
[101:01.85]What was it?
[101:02.67]Alas, you have yet to prove it.
[101:05.11]If you would prove yourself the Arisen, show no fear.
[101:08.99]Okay.
[101:11.15]So... I mean, call the Arisen.
[101:14.53]Check the area around the encampment until you find a threat that... So I just have to fight a monster.
[101:18.95]Okay.
[101:22.39]A Writhstone.
[101:23.01]A strange power emanates from within...
[101:26.81]Is he gonna follow me?
[101:40.80]When foes are too much to handle... They're not gonna be too much to handle.
[101:56.85]So he was a light fire wizard.
[101:58.51]Yeah, that's a... So I was partially correct.
[102:02.57]Like, he has, like, light.
[102:03.99]And, like, force, like, waves, and... I was correct.
[102:08.29]He does have fire.
[102:09.75]This is actually... This thing's pretty huge.
[102:16.99]Alright, get in there.
[102:20.73]Oh, shit.
[102:26.96]Climb on a larger monster.
[102:31.24]What is heavy attack like this?
[102:32.30]Okay, just fire.
[102:35.16]Okay, so as you take damage, the amount of health you can recover through magic in the field also decreases, indicated by a white barb.
[102:44.39]You have to rest it in, or use a curative item to fully restore your health.
[102:50.80]Giving pawns curatives to hold will allow them to use it at their own discretion.
[102:54.04]Okay.
[102:54.62]Yeah, well there's no reason for me to do that.
[103:00.94]Thanks for the enchantment.
[103:04.69]So if you burn them, they'll just, they light on fire.
[103:07.17]I gotta climb up on top.
[103:08.15]Should I even climb up on top?
[103:09.07]Should I just stand back and just cast fireballs?
[103:10.85]Let's get a heal over there.
[103:27.22]Alright, I gotta stop.
[103:32.59]Somebody just said mage gameplay.
[103:35.35]And then they said ResidentSleeper.
[103:38.19]I'm a fucking Gandalf, alright?
[103:40.17]So I'm gonna play Gandalf.
[103:41.73]What?
[103:43.11]Get away from me.
[103:53.24]Why did I just leave?
[103:55.10]What the hell was that?
[103:56.47]Um, alright, can I climb and do, like, a firebomb in his head?
[104:02.19]Oh, I can, like, shoot him in the head.
[104:11.45]Oh, fuck.
[104:26.16]This is a lot of moving around.
[104:34.80]Cut away its support?
[104:36.96]Alright, I gotta hit him right in the other leg.
[104:40.68]Right near that elephant.
[104:42.94]Alright, now enchant me.
[104:48.49]Somebody do something!
[104:49.73]God damn it!
[104:58.05]Hey, you can't use his arms.
[105:05.79]Light all of his whole body on fire.
[105:11.16]Magic users.
[105:12.54]Laughing my ass off.
[105:15.20]Look, I'm just, I'm gonna be just fine.
[105:21.14]Mage gameplay.
[105:22.40]Don't worry, it's gonna be fun.
[105:23.74]Right in the face.
[105:25.06]That's what he's gotta do.
[105:28.02]I gotta just mage him in the face.
[105:31.70]Just wait till I get the lightning move.
[105:39.13]Oh shit, I'm tired.
[105:43.35]What a true mage.
[105:45.33]I'm a little sleepy right now.
[105:46.69]I'm gonna cast a fireball at him.
[105:56.81]The mage is always terrible.
[105:58.13]It's not gonna get better.
[106:01.57]Don't tell me that.
[106:04.57]Gandalf is like my favorite character in Lord of the Rings.
[106:13.28]Who the hell is that?
[106:14.32]Is that Palpatine or something?
[106:15.50]What the fuck is that?
[106:23.49]Mage gets really cool later.
[106:24.81]Yeah, so we're gonna be just fine.
[106:29.65]Nothing else?
[106:33.79]Mage at endgame becomes literal Jedi God.
[106:37.39]So see, everything's gonna be just fine.
[106:38.69]Alright, I have proved my worthiness.
[106:54.15]Early mage gameplay, ResidentSleeper.
[106:56.28]That's how it always is.
[106:57.06]Remember, Gandalf was level two in Lord of the Rings.
[107:02.58]He could have done so much more, but he didn't.
[107:05.36]Because he wanted to make sure that they had the trial, not him.
[107:09.93]Bunch of uncultured swine.
[107:12.91]Ekbal, located in the command headquarters of the encampment, provides many different support functions to adventurers.
[107:20.19]Speak with them to rest and heal your wounds.
[107:21.91]Learn and enable useful weapon skills.
[107:24.15]Restore excess items.
[107:27.19]Okay.
[107:27.79]Where's my discipline point?
[107:28.95]Let me see.
[107:30.81]275.
[107:31.19]Alright, I can do an- I can get another move.
[107:38.16]Let's see what they got here.
[107:39.34]Uh, Frazzle.
[107:41.08]Concentrate a field of cold around the user that deals ice damage to whatever foe it touches.
[107:44.76]It's a battle mage.
[107:51.64]Thunder Boon.
[107:52.36]Launches bolt of magic that enchants an ally's weapon with thunder, so I can enchant his weapon.
[107:57.04]And my own, right?
[108:00.52]Levin.
[108:01.50]Smites the enemy from above with tongues of lightning, especially effective at driving foes out of hiding.
[108:08.37]Okay.
[108:10.23]It does do my weapon.
[108:12.09]I kind of think that's cool.
[108:15.85]So I can shoot lightning bolts?
[108:19.91]This does sound really cool, too.
[108:24.91]Yeah, I'll try this.
[108:27.55]Tongues of Lightning from above.
[108:31.76]Mage is a good base for a Magic Archer?
[108:35.14]That sounds pretty fun.
[108:38.90]Eleven.
[108:42.04]Okay.
[108:42.24]Now I have to change my skills.
[108:45.10]I don't have any Augments?
[108:51.85]No.
[108:53.36]So I can do... That's Fireball.
[108:54.92]We'll just do... Levin up here on Primary.
[109:01.20]I can do... It's like switching to... That's like freaking me out here.
[109:04.68]Stop doing that.
[109:06.71]Alright, Levin is gonna be Y. Nah, I'm gonna test it on this guy's skull and see what happens.
[109:13.85]Let's see... Levin.
[109:22.43]I'm just kidding, I'm not gonna do that.
[109:24.87]This game looks fucking awesome.
[109:27.51]Yeah, I mean, early game this seems... just, like, there's a lot to do, a lot going on.
[109:33.13]I'm very interested, it's very fun.
[109:43.15]This is going to the Switch?
[109:45.07]No, it's not.
[109:51.78]It is?
[109:52.72]Ugh.
[109:57.18]Ugh.
[109:58.79]I'm quit.
[109:59.23]I'm not.
[110:00.67]The stream's over.
[110:01.83]I want to play this in bed on the Switch.
[110:03.59]So, thanks for watching, everybody.
[110:04.71]Just kidding.
[110:05.67]So, this is where I'm going to make another character.
[110:17.59]Oh, God.
[110:18.25]Set the look of your constant companion throughout your journey as Arisen, your main pawn.
[110:27.16]This is important.
[110:33.38]This is Kenshi.
[110:34.42]Another hour incoming.
[110:35.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[110:36.69]We're gonna get this done very quickly.
[110:39.41]Pawn.
[110:39.63]Okay.
[110:40.61]Uh, another wizard.
[110:41.73]Well...
[110:43.32]I'm doing Star Wars A Link to the Past, every single- I'm gonna have four wizards, and we're each gonna be a different element.
[110:52.07]Like in that Zelda game.
[110:53.75]I'm gonna have Fire Wizard, I'm gonna have Lightning Wizard, I'm gonna have Ice Wizard, I'm gonna have fucking, uh... Jester, like Joke Wizard.
[111:09.96]Not a wizard... I can't do, like, all red robe, blue robe, green robe, white robe?
[111:16.11]That would be so interesting.
[111:21.73]Oh, I only get to... I only get one.
[111:24.03]Oh, shit.
[111:24.67]This has to be a huge guy.
[111:26.41]I gotta make a huge tank.
[111:31.06]You can do that, but it would be awful.
[111:42.85]Be smart about this.
[111:44.59]But I want to do like the four links.
[111:56.46]You can do it, but only if you're stupid and I hate you.
[111:59.34]Come on.
[112:07.36]Alright, OK, here we go.
[112:20.60]I don't know what the hell that name was.
[112:22.02]That's why I instantly deleted it.
[112:37.31]Bob Shell.
[112:45.80]Uh...
[112:53.92]Can do Jex.
[112:57.90]Jinx.
[113:10.43]Can't make Ronald McDonald.
[113:22.72]Mickey D.
[113:27.28]Oh, I hate making characters because I sit here for too long.
[113:31.74]Shito?
[113:32.52]I can't make Shito.
[113:33.20]Shito would have to be a bard.

[119:25.55]And just a circle for a head.

[119:41.98]That one's not bad.
[119:43.28]I can make it.
[119:43.70]That one's okay.
[119:44.36]Yeah, this one.
[119:44.82]This is like a nice, round face.
[119:51.32]Eyes have to be just the two dots.
[119:54.37]Why don't you just do that?
[120:01.57]You're making Bobby Hill.
[120:04.65]I'm not making Bobby Hill.
[120:12.41]I can make the eyes really small.
[120:13.73]Okay, hold on.
[120:14.95]This character's gonna be fucking terrible.

[120:28.16]Size, small.
[120:29.32]Eye color, black.
[120:32.50]Okay.
[120:42.94]Face shape, is there a way I can add details?

[120:50.90]The head, it is a little bigger.
[120:52.20]Okay, eyes.
[120:59.37]We gotta get the shape.
[121:00.75]Brows.
[121:02.41]No brows.
[121:03.29]Can I just delete them?
[121:09.76]Hold on, I think I can.
[121:17.68]Eh, you can't really see them there.
[121:18.98]Just make them lighter.
[121:26.47]nose we need to try to get rid of the nose is that even possible I have to get a little one vertical position it's not possible
[122:04.13]This is where we're going to get... It's going to get sold here.
[122:07.15]Ready?
[122:08.95]We need a long, skinny, wide mouth.
[122:17.93]That's as wide as I can get?
[122:18.91]That is the widest I can get it.
[122:28.79]No ears.
[122:46.09]God, this didn't work.
[122:47.39]At all.
[122:59.62]Uh... What about, like, makeup?
[123:01.56]Can I add anything?
[123:05.72]No, it just has to be... I mean, this actually helps a little, because...
[123:15.16]Shito's eyes are just black.
[123:35.53]No, that doesn't... This is not bad.
[123:41.65]It really isn't.
[123:42.63]Because that's the line for the mouth, that's the darker eyes.
[123:51.70]I'm not going to want to listen to that.
[123:57.48]I can't believe I'm doing the YouTuber joke.
[124:04.13]How tall is he?
[124:14.25]He's huge!
[124:33.18]All the way tall, but he's... He fits in my hand.
[124:37.78]You know...
[124:55.63]tall and lanky I mean he is very lanky but he's very tall he said he's seven feet tall alright this is a weird universe fine change the voice
[125:27.39]Can I change this voice later?
[125:28.61]That's... You're talking... Like, four hours from now.
[125:32.51]You really don't wanna hear that shit anymore?
[125:51.44]That's good.
[125:52.82]I'm not... I can't handle the baby voice the whole time.
[126:02.27]Nobody can take that.
[126:03.09]I like 8.
[126:16.20]8 is just enough annoyance without being annoying.
[126:19.10]Alright, I'm good.
[126:26.33]Shito?
[126:31.52]I think that's good to go.
[126:37.30]Ooh, hold on, hold on.
[126:38.72]I gotta answer as if I am Shito, so this is important.
[126:41.38]Your answers will shape your pawn's inclination.
[126:44.14]When faced with danger, which trait would you most value in a follower?
[126:50.17]The charisma to lead others.
[126:52.53]Charisma.
[126:54.23]Shito sings.
[127:03.78]While in battle, which strategy would you prefer your follower employ?
[127:06.49]Kill all enemies.
[127:09.57]Strike at the strongest foe.
[127:12.57]Rescue comrades in danger.
[127:14.65]Call for reinforcements.
[127:17.49]Call.
[127:20.65]Call or rescue.
[127:26.68]Shita would never kill anybody.
[127:31.33]Your follower rescues your party and turns the tide of the entire battle.
[127:35.25]What would you have them say?
[127:41.29]This way, Master.
[127:42.37]Leave them to me.
[127:43.21]Now, Master, strike the final blow.
[127:45.45]Quickly!
[127:46.09]After them!
[127:55.39]Master, strike the final blow.
[127:59.03]As a ruler, which gift would you... How happy would you be about one of these options?
[128:03.83]A magic potion that preserves youth?
[128:10.51]A brave and just hero to succeed you.
[128:12.25]The perfect spouse.
[128:15.28]A majestic white steed.
[128:24.54]It's not spouse.
[128:34.44]Perfect spouse.
[128:37.95]Into the spouse, of course.
[128:42.61]Spouse means a little bit more utility.
[128:48.02]Spouse is more guardian.
[128:54.28]Gandalf has a white horse.
[128:57.41]This is not Gandalf, though.
[129:02.24]I think I like the utility.
[129:04.20]Whitesteed.
[129:06.10]Vocation.
[129:07.10]Fighter, Strider, Mage.
[129:14.76]Hmm.
[129:19.49]Probably something that can... One of these two.
[129:27.27]We're going to get our asses kicked if I do Mage.
[129:40.82]Bow and arrow.
[129:41.48]I mean, the bow is shaped like his body, so... The bow, it's a bit sad.
[129:49.30]That's what his body looks like.
[130:01.04]Don't worry, the next character we get is gonna be Danny DeVito, and he'll be a tank.
[130:14.29]Nothing about this is correct.
[130:15.97]Okay, I was going to say, what am I supposed to be doing here?
[130:44.27]Quest successful, having been recognized as a Risen, you've been granted a loyal pawn to be your constant companion in your journey.
[130:52.21]In addition to this main pawn, you may hire up to two other pawns to support you in your adventures.
[130:57.18]Different pawns have different strengths, so you support pawns to tailor your party to fit your current needs.
[131:04.45]In addition to minding level and available skills, a pawn's knowledge is another important part of creating an effective party.
[131:10.40]Pawns with appropriate knowledge of quests or foes can provide helpful advice and battle strategies.
[131:14.86]Okay.
[131:18.42]What am I doing?
[131:31.93]This is a rift, a space between realms from which any and all manner of pawns may be found.
[131:39.10]Should one catch your eye, speak with the pawn to enlist it to your party.
[131:42.02]He's a God of War guy.
[131:49.05]You may hire only two pawns onto your party at one time.
[131:52.15]They can then be discharged.
[132:02.37]You may hire only two pawns onto your party at one time.
[132:05.82]They can then be discharged by speaking with them again.
[132:09.47]Hmm, I wonder if I should pick Poop Butt.
[132:13.73]I wonder.
[132:14.95]This, that's, oh, what a great character that probably is.
[132:24.96]Level 61.
[132:29.30]What level am I?
[132:29.88]I'm level 4.
[132:31.28]Why would I bring a level 61?
[132:32.39]Alright, I wanna like, how do I see more?
[132:40.99]Get out of here.
[132:42.71]All of you, get out of here.
[132:47.72]We're gonna do Process of Elimination.
[132:52.12]You get the fuck out of here, too.
[132:53.68]I can't.
[132:58.10]Uh... Did you just give me just five of the same default character?
[133:08.42]Alright, that's like, that's like bird box Sandra Bullock.
[133:11.08]I'll get out of here.
[133:17.00]Dab.
[133:22.22]Only poop butt remains.
[133:27.02]Oh, man.
[133:29.84]Gamora.
[133:31.28]Gamora.
[133:37.46]Ikki.
[133:39.49]Toasted bear.
[133:40.75]Goodbye.
[133:43.43]Duke?
[133:44.65]No.
[133:46.65]No.
[133:48.84]No.
[133:49.44]Fucking poop butt.
[133:50.66]Why do you have to be the best character right now?
[133:55.28]He's just waiting.
[133:56.36]He's looking at me, just waiting.
[134:00.96]No, I don't want Elizabeth.
[134:05.12]Mickey Mouse, get out of here.
[134:07.38]You get out of here.
[134:10.13]Alright, this one's at least, there's some detail here.
[134:12.17]Level 4.
[134:17.35]He's the best qualified!
[134:18.91]Why do you have to be the best qualified?
[134:22.49]Get out of here!
[134:23.31]Give me somebody else!
[134:31.63]No!
[134:40.75]Stop looking at me like that!
[134:57.14]Use the stone in search.
[135:00.52]Pawns by level.
[135:05.15]Friends.
[135:18.64]Wait, that is one of my friends, somehow!
[135:31.29]Star made that character.
[135:45.72]No, I'm not using that.
[135:47.84]Top ranked.
[135:52.10]Rank 1.
[135:52.52]Hold on, let me search for level.
[135:58.87]Level 4.
[136:06.49]Download Jerma.
[136:09.35]I don't even know how to do that.
[136:11.98]Search conditions.
[136:19.83]Search by name?
[136:20.67]I don't think I can.
[136:22.45]Narrow by vocation, weapon, skills, or gender.
[136:29.34]Name search.
[136:36.40]Search.
[136:38.74]Pawns, pass summons, favorite list, pawns your main, pawn nodes, pawns by level.
[136:45.18]Go back, go back, name.
[136:50.01]I don't think I can.
[136:54.47]My friends.
[136:56.87]Change search conditions.
[137:05.50]Because I don't think I can... Why are you doing this?
[137:08.76]Poop butt is right there.
[137:21.40]Why are you doing that?
[137:23.24]Poop butt is right here.
[137:27.59]It's the easy, but that's the... One more time.
[137:46.97]Get rid of Rook?
[137:47.63]I don't think I can.
[137:49.45]Is everything in order, Master?
[137:51.50]Get the fuck out of here.
[137:55.28]Okay.
[138:01.46]What do you got for stats?
[138:13.10]Fighter.
[138:18.30]No, no.
[138:19.90]No, no, no.
[138:22.24]Get away from me.
[138:25.17]Alright, this is the last time I'm gonna refresh.
[138:31.47]You've got like a swear in your name.
[138:32.77]Get out of here.
[138:35.75]Take Tiny Tim.
[138:36.53]Tiny Tim is like level 60.
[138:38.48]I can't take Tiny Tim.
[138:50.64]Is there no one worthy of this party?
[138:58.95]Why?
[139:00.47]Search by level?
[139:04.55]No.
[139:05.35]No.
[139:05.73]Okay, search.
[139:09.01]He's like 30?
[139:11.09]He's level 9.
[139:16.80]Samwise?
[139:17.62]What?
[139:22.15]If I search by level, then Poop Butt goes away.
[139:28.65]Yeah, plus, look, see, it's like... I can't even see what they look like.
[139:31.19]I have to summon them to see what they look like.
[139:43.35]Okay, I'm not picking one of the ones with the asterisks.
[139:50.41]Alright, I'm gonna try one.
[139:51.61]I'm gonna go for one.
[139:52.41]We're gonna see what they look like.
[139:53.49]Here we go.
[139:53.97]We're gonna go with, um... No, that's a mage.
[139:55.97]We need a fighter.
[139:58.30]Tiny... Let's take a look.
[140:04.50]Tim... Tiny Tim.
[140:07.29]Tiny Tank Tim.
[140:17.59]Um... I thought that said it's Gaten Delph.
[140:20.25]I don't know.
[140:21.43]We need to look at... We need to... Gabe.
[140:23.73]Rhythm.
[140:24.41]Okay.
[140:25.11]Bring him out.
[140:26.93]Right?
[140:27.67]They should be coming out here?
[140:43.53]That's supposed to be fucking Gabe Newell, isn't it?
[140:50.50]No, I don't want to do Gabe Newell.
[140:52.98]That's the ultimate look-at-me joke.
[140:55.32]No.
[140:55.78]Everybody go away.
[140:57.60]What's worse?
[140:58.32]I'm not sure.
[140:59.52]Gabe Newell or poop butt.
[141:00.90]I don't know.
[141:11.87]They're both bad.
[141:17.51]Oh, no.
[141:18.02]I can't...
[141:20.02]Alright, that's it.
[141:21.13]I'm out of here.
[141:53.31]Just get over here.
[142:05.02]No, I can't use Tiny Tim.
[142:07.62]Don't you guys realize Tiny Tim is way overleveled?
[142:10.36]He's just gonna kill everything in one hit.
[142:14.32]Ah, a master and his pawn, is it?
[142:17.54]You'll be quite the force come the day you learn to fight as one.
[142:22.77]I didn't do it right?
[142:24.27]Mind you, that is a skill better... I can help in that, Rico.
[142:28.23]What the fuck are you talking about?
[142:29.45]Hold on.
[142:51.66]Alright, I need to go back.
[142:52.50]Where's the rift?
[142:59.70]Oh my god.
[143:00.42]Is that a waypoint?
[143:03.56]Just go.
[143:04.40]Give me... Can I not go back?
[143:20.79]No, I don't want to do the... I'm not doing that yet.
[143:22.85]I'll talk to you in a minute.
[143:28.04]Well, it just teleported me to the front of that door.
[143:31.46]I was standing in front of the stone, and then it was like, no, you're over here.
[143:33.78]Oh my god, I already hate that voice.
[143:37.02]Okay, come back.
[143:55.80]Who the fuck are you?
[144:00.24]Okay, there.
[144:07.08]I am honored to travel with you.
[144:16.49]I'm not bringing the level 31.
[144:18.07]Do you understand?
[144:19.69]No.
[144:20.77]I'm not bringing them.
[144:26.22]This is gonna ruin the game, isn't it?
[144:27.98]I'll use them later.
[144:37.25]What happened to game?
[144:46.56]They leveled down.
[144:53.29]Fuck is he?
[144:54.19]Come on.
[144:54.83]Let's do this and get out of here.
[144:56.17]Gabe, where are you?
[144:57.45]I have to keep Gabe.
[145:00.38]No, they don't.
[145:01.14]One guy said that.
[145:03.00]No, why didn't I bring in Donald Trump?
[145:09.90]I think we lost Gabe forever.
[145:26.80]That guy deleted his character.
[145:36.05]Is that guy currently playing the game?
[145:38.71]And did he level the character up once?
[145:51.00]Not Ballsack!
[145:53.38]Wait, I need to see if he leveled up his character once.
[145:57.46]He's currently playing the game right now.
[145:58.86]Where is he?
[146:07.15]Guys, there's no fucking way that I'm gonna do poop, butt, and ball sack.
[146:12.59]I'm 33.
[146:14.49]I'm a 33 year old man.
[146:16.11]Do you understand how, like, that, I, my mother would be so disappointed.
[146:24.16]Where is Gabe Newell?
[146:28.34]By level six?
[146:41.68]Where the fuck is this guy?
[147:05.57]Get out of the way.
[147:06.13]Out.
[147:06.43]Out.
[147:06.79]Out.
[147:07.01]All of you.
[147:07.61]Tiny Tim.
[147:08.23]You.
[147:08.73]Go.
[147:10.22]Gabe.
[147:13.30]We want ball sack.
[147:14.36]You're not gonna get it.
[147:24.41]I'm not gonna do fucking ball sack.
[147:34.66]Out.
[147:40.84]At least see if Ballsack... No!
[147:44.20]Who's talking?
[147:48.28]Oh, I hate this crew.
[147:50.75]No, this is like the joke crew.
[147:53.91]I wanted to... I am Mercedes.
[147:57.81]I lead the men of the Enlistment Corps.
[148:02.47]We play.
[148:02.91]We have to play.
[148:03.97]Oh, this is just like a meme.
[148:05.50]A meme team.
[148:06.26]I'm pretty sure a ballsack is mine.
[148:32.22]You're here watching?
[148:34.18]Alright, let's go.
[148:34.73]You don't need any rest.
[148:48.76]Oh yeah, I can't wait!
[148:49.56]I can't wait to play!
[148:50.84]Let's rest, why not?
[149:31.74]This voice shit is gonna get so irritating.
[149:35.06]I'm gonna hate this.
[149:40.89]Hydra!
[149:44.56]Where are my friends?
[149:58.85]This whole thing can't be taken seriously.
[150:08.67]Oh, that's pretty nice.
[150:14.43]What is Poopbutt doing?
[150:15.84]I hate this.
[150:17.08]This is gonna get so old.
[150:22.68]Very quickly.
[150:32.95]You can't even hear what they're saying.
[150:45.21]The low voice is when I went into that closet and did the monster politics thing.
[150:50.18]It's coming back to me.
[150:52.04]Full circle.
[151:01.94]I'm gonna fireball.
[151:02.82]Save poopbot.
[151:05.41]He'll be fine.
[151:08.55]He's getting eaten.
[151:23.73]No!
[151:24.97]Save him!
[151:27.99]How do I save him?
[151:29.19]He's getting digested!
[151:30.85]Oh fuck!
[151:32.25]How do I get out?
[151:46.26]I can't do this.
[151:47.58]It's too many distractions.
[152:00.52]I can't, I'm sorry.
[152:06.83]How do I get him out?
[152:10.15]He's gonna get digested.
[152:11.97]How do I get him out?
[152:13.65]How do I get him out?
[152:28.50]No!
[152:51.29]My fucking stomach.
[152:52.79]I hate this.
[152:54.27]I want to restart the game.
[152:56.38]I'm going to heal you.
[152:57.76]Come here.
[153:17.76]We're okay, everyone's fine.
[153:18.74]Is this character just a sucker?
[153:25.67]I don't think I'm supposed to win.
[153:41.24]Oh my god, it's... Smite the Hydra's neck.
[153:54.37]Okay.
[153:55.67]I'll try.
[153:57.43]I'll try.
[154:01.81]I've never seen this fight take this long.
[154:03.17]It's because I'm in like a fit right now.
[154:12.54]Once poop butt got eaten.
[154:15.00]And then all the sounds and the noises and the fucking terrible voices.
[154:19.14]And then slowly going all the way down and being digested.
[154:24.85]I'm sorry, guys.
[154:25.69]I couldn't handle that.
[154:30.25]My fucking head hurts.
[155:00.31]No, I have to go get Ballsack.
[155:03.05]It was inevitable, I think.
[155:04.35]This game is fucking awesome.
[155:05.77]Hold on, not now.
[155:07.71]I want to go get Ballsack.
[155:31.71]I can't use it.
[156:05.97]Wait, I can?
[156:09.03]Oh, that's the waypoint.
[156:10.69]Okay, right.
[156:13.65]It's got a big X on it.
[156:17.17]Alright, let's go get Ballsack.
[156:27.48]I can't fucking believe I'm back here already.
[156:35.97]No, there is.
[156:36.93]No.
[156:57.35]Where is Ballsack?
[156:59.53]Wait, he's already there.
[157:11.45]5?
[157:28.36]Is it not a fighter?
[157:28.96]Was he a different class?
[157:39.07]Level one.
[157:51.41]Level nine.
[157:52.19]Ball sack was level four.
[157:55.33]Level four.
[157:56.27]Didn't I just look at level four?
[158:07.35]You have to RNG his name.
[158:08.83]Oh, there's no way that's going to happen again, is there?
[158:27.18]Hamburger feet?
[158:28.74]I don't think I want that one.
[158:33.20]Oh, nope.
[158:53.39]Let's see what Hamburger Feet looks like.
[158:55.15]I don't... Alright, let's go.
[159:26.71]She's the most normal character.
[159:34.72]With the most abnormal name.
[159:42.52]Alright, let's go.
[159:57.31]What do you know?
[159:57.85]Holy shit, he's still in the encampment.
[160:04.25]Yeah, I'm just... I'm just... I like just looking around and doing stuff.
[160:11.99]This is a lot of fun.
[160:16.83]Alright, regroup with Sir Mercedes.
[160:18.99]Head for the mountain Waycastle and help her escort it.
[160:26.39]Escort mission?
[160:29.74]What the hell are you doing here?
[160:43.70]Oh.
[160:50.16]He's coming with us.
[160:52.68]Full party member is my ass.
[160:56.06]Ow.
[161:03.02]Nice catch.
[161:05.54]Can we not bring him?
[161:11.84]A terrible creature.
[161:13.54]I saw it from my spot at the post.
[161:15.94]What was it?
[161:17.50]It's been dispatched then?
[161:19.47]Uh, hold a moment.
[161:20.99]Is Kina not with you?
[161:23.67]She was said to lead the village in search of art for your wounds.
[161:27.03]I thought you accompanied her.
[161:30.47]Where do we go from here?
[161:31.37]Alright, let's see.
[161:31.83]We got up here, uh...
[161:58.46]Manamiya Trail, or we can go to down here, which is the Seabreeze Trail.
[162:08.72]This is the main storyline here, so we're gonna go to this one.
[162:17.69]Let's go!
[162:22.09]You just made my grandmother cry.
[162:23.53]I'm sorry.
[162:24.09]I just needed to see if it was possible.
[162:26.99]Who are we killing?
[162:27.41]This is like Grand Theft Auto.
[162:29.90]Don't put pedestrians in front of me.
[162:31.18]Who?
[162:56.82]Oh, these guys.
[162:57.76]Holy shit.
[163:01.70]Oh my god.
[163:05.92]I didn't have to do anything.
[163:07.82]Shido, what the hell was that?
[163:12.60]What is it chasing after this person?
[163:16.06]What?
[163:21.20]This is too much random shit going on.
[163:32.72]Okay.
[163:33.24]Boost your prowess on a vocation.
[163:34.92]Alright, so I gotta be doing moves.
[163:37.13]Dogs?
[163:37.33]Up ahead.
[163:37.61]Lightning bolt attack.
[163:40.57]I gotta queue it up.
[164:10.89]I just hit that guy right in the back.
[164:15.35]Mage is not really great, ain't it?
[164:17.93]Not an early game.
[164:20.83]No fireballs.
[164:21.71]Early game.
[164:29.78]That's targeting them completely, right?
[164:31.32]That's not doing any damage?
[164:32.72]Uh, splash damage?
[164:33.56]Alright, looks good.
[164:41.45]Chest?
[164:49.13]Oil.
[164:49.45]Nope.
[164:50.15]Do you guys have any room?
[164:54.84]Apparently not.
[164:55.50]Alright, let's go.
[164:58.22]Whoa!
[164:59.10]That's a lot of wolves.
[165:01.44]It does a lot of damage, but... Is it... Oh, fuck.
[165:09.73]Get out of the way, out of the way, out of the way!
[165:17.13]I'm gonna put a heal down.
[165:23.57]No, I'm not.
[165:26.35]Thank you, Gabe.
[165:27.43]Thank you for being an actual character.
[165:38.07]Sour Beast.
[165:43.60]Small Fang.
[165:44.28]I just love looting.
[165:47.74]Small Fang.
[165:49.34]I can make food and shit probably, right?
[165:53.27]What are you guys doing?
[165:54.38]Oh.
[165:54.62]Vocation Rank, Cheeto.
[165:59.36]They're so useless.
[166:00.06]Alright, can we please go?
[166:19.69]So I have to buy experience stuff, right?
[166:23.79]Let me see.
[166:25.19]Status for Shito, okay.
[166:28.05]Skills.
[166:30.61]Oh, I gotta go to one of those vendors.
[166:39.83]Buff them with fire and lightning?
[166:41.05]Oh, so I can, wait, I can cast it and I can enchant it with those two.
[166:48.97]How do I enchant myself?
[166:49.91]Can I enchant myself?
[166:53.53]Why even attack?
[166:58.62]I can just grab them and throw them.
[167:00.18]That was impressive.
[167:01.28]That was really impressive, actually.
[167:23.36]Dammit.
[167:23.84]Ten out of ten mage.
[167:24.96]I know, right?
[167:26.44]You mean zero out of ten.
[167:28.82]I miss the guy that gave me fire enchantments.
[167:56.54]Nice.
[167:57.48]Is this?
[168:00.63]Nice damage.
[168:13.18]I'm so useless.
[168:14.74]That was... They're showing me up so bad on my own stream.
[168:19.44]It's not good.
[168:24.94]I'm just gonna put heals down.
[168:26.64]I mean, just throw a heal.
[168:28.00]Just stay on the heal.
[168:31.74]I'll be supporting.
[168:32.54]Alright, let's keep going.
[168:53.11]Somebody get money?
[168:54.65]Alright, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[168:58.91]Shito is streaming right now.
[169:00.45]Yeah, I want like a more- I want a better stream.
[169:05.10]I'm the little dickhead that's getting carried by his two friends.
[169:12.32]Save.
[169:12.46]Save and continue.
[169:13.46]Yes.
[169:25.79]The road splits here.
[169:26.63]Let's be doubly sure which we'll see is to our destination.
[169:30.40]So the road splits.
[169:31.68]Should I go this way?
[169:32.28]Let's check out the left side.
[169:35.74]No, that's... No, no, no.
[169:36.88]This is like a tutorial.
[169:38.68]This is the please learn to play a game.
[169:41.22]You go straight down the road.
[169:45.52]Did somebody actually make the name Shido right now?
[169:51.83]How the hell could you be that fast?
[169:52.83]Don't you need, like, to verify an email?
[169:54.54]Here we go.
[169:55.52]Good.
[170:11.20]How animal is this?
[170:12.36]It's been three hours?
[170:13.51]Well, I mean, to be fair, I did spend about 30 to 40 minutes making the character.
[170:16.77]That was me having fun.
[170:17.65]Escort to the capital, huh?
[170:18.99]No.
[170:19.07]This is going to be hell, isn't it?
[170:53.17]Everybody stop.
[170:54.32]Stop!
[170:54.98]Get healed.
[170:55.46]Oh my god.
[170:59.18]No, get out of the way.
[171:01.40]Oh, they're kicking the shit out of this thing.
[171:03.30]Here, eat air, motherfucker!
[171:25.08]Can I heal the goat bowl thing?
[171:28.56]Can I climb on it?
[171:32.60]Okay, if I press B, it sprints.
[171:49.95]This is going to be good for the lightning.
[171:51.57]Watch this.
[171:51.91]Ready?
[171:52.25]Bingo.
[171:54.41]That's terrible, by the way.
[172:00.26]Move out of the way.
[172:01.30]I need a clear shot.
[172:12.35]Stop making fun of my damage!
[172:13.59]Grab the cow.
[172:14.35]Actually, uh, Ingle is actually not bad.
[172:15.96]That knocks him down and then they can deal with him.
[172:18.26]Alright.
[172:18.48]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[172:24.38]How's the cow?
[172:40.14]I can... Can I ride the cow?
[172:43.51]Moonshit pass.
[172:44.43]Wait!
[172:52.01]That was really dumb.
[172:53.01]Is there any... I can't... None of this matters?
[172:54.77]I can't loot this?
[173:20.03]I guess I can make it go faster just by lightly.
[173:24.96]That's how you know how weak this character truly is.
[173:29.10]I can't even make him run faster.
[173:31.00]I'm such a wuss.
[173:35.16]I just hurt myself.
[173:38.76]Eleven!
[173:51.49]That's not bad.
[173:55.54]That's not bad.
[173:56.48]The damage, I'm getting made fun of.
[173:59.86]Can we just... Don't throw that over here.
[174:04.90]What are you, stupid?
[174:07.68]Alright, I got vocation rank.
[174:11.48]I gotta learn new skills.
[174:13.50]How are we doing on health?
[174:18.66]Put it down here.
[174:20.46]Walk right into it.
[174:21.50]Alright, let's go faster.
[174:29.08]Hurry up.
[174:32.60]Slow it down.
[174:32.92]How do I slow it down?
[174:33.90]Slow it down.
[174:34.32]How do I slow it down?
[174:34.98]How do I slow it down?
[174:47.39]I've learned a new way to fight I'm so smart How far away are we?
[174:49.79]Keep watch for falling rocks on the path ahead captain
[175:20.11]Can I talk?
[175:23.31]The pawns talk a lot.
[175:25.34]Yeah, they do.
[175:32.32]Half the time it's just fucking gibberish.
[175:36.78]I gotta ground him, that's my job.
[175:38.54]I figured out the job.
[175:45.24]I knock them down from the air, and everyone else finishes them off.
[175:47.77]I'm an integral part of this mission.
[175:51.87]What are you doing?
[175:52.59]You're taunting from, like, 50 feet away?
[175:57.23]Alright, we're almost there.
[176:07.93]Uh, fallen rock.
[176:08.79]Stay at the card side.
[176:10.35]The path diverges.
[176:12.13]That's literally just one rock.
[176:14.07]That wasn't even a real rock.
[176:15.19]That was a fake rock.
[176:26.04]Alright, go faster.
[176:31.70]Behind us!
[176:32.46]Stand clear!
[176:35.40]Do not get trapped!
[176:40.03]what's behind us?
[176:42.63]Oh, Oh God.
[176:45.03]Go faster.
[176:45.81]Fast, fast.
[176:47.45]Don't stop.
[176:48.46]We're exposed here.
[176:51.92]How'd it go?
[176:52.32]Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.
[176:57.20]Oh no.
[176:58.08]Oh no.
[176:58.48]Oh no.
[176:58.82]We're fine.
[177:01.69]Come here.
[177:02.93]Ready to group up.
[177:09.43]Thank God.
[177:13.72]Alright, we should be safe.
[177:15.26]Not yet, there's a bunch of wolves and shit over here.
[177:17.08]Come on, go!
[177:18.52]Hop!
[177:19.06]Oh, this is bad.
[177:27.89]How do you just heal?
[177:29.55]Just be useful.
[177:30.99]Put a heal down, right here.
[177:44.70]Do you have to cut over there?
[177:46.04]I didn't even get to see what I did.
[177:47.74]Can I even deal with the power?
[177:50.28]You didn't really end it.
[177:51.99]Although, you tried.
[178:13.06]You can turn off the cinematics though, okay.
[178:17.54]I'm gonna put it in the way, the cow.
[178:26.29]That was not even in the way, the cow.
[178:29.75]Come here.
[178:30.63]Heal cow.
[178:35.37]You progress through the game by completing quests.
[178:37.13]Always talk with the people you meet.
[178:38.56]They'll surely have a lot for you to do.
[178:40.48]Oh my god.
[178:40.84]Yeah.
[178:40.96]Air shot.
[178:42.22]I was going to do that.
[178:49.42]What are you doing?
[178:50.78]I've learned a new way to fight their illness.
[179:06.44]We have triumphed come here I can't even heal it with the go to an end Who's left will not hold them long goblin
[179:35.97]Where?
[179:36.25]Oh, I love this game.
[179:37.33]It's just so much going on.
[179:39.43]Lots of goblins.
[179:40.47]Alright, I gotta be prepared for this.
[179:45.80]Heal in the middle.
[179:47.34]Lightning.
[179:47.72]Right inside.
[180:08.59]Get out of here.
[180:10.08]No, the dog!
[180:20.22]The cow!
[180:21.46]Oh my god, I can't even do any... Just heal.
[180:27.98]Who cares about anything else?
[180:29.22]Oh my god!
[180:40.03]We're not far now, men!
[180:42.01]Where am I?
[180:42.81]Keep marching!
[180:43.97]This place must have seen a ferocious battle.
[180:46.05]This is not good.
[180:46.99]No, we just wedged in.
[180:50.89]What is with this camera?
[180:51.67]Alright, we're good.
[180:56.85]Almost there.
[180:59.82]Onward!
[181:00.72]We are near half between the encampment and the Capitalite Warrant.
[181:04.46]Goblin!
[181:08.22]Eat shit.
[181:10.32]See, I'm useful.
[181:13.96]I just have to be very far away.
[181:16.32]And without anyone knowing I'm here.
[181:18.09]I've learned new techniques against that foe.
[181:21.43]The canyon floor is an apt spot to find ourselves surrounded.
[181:25.09]We best be careful.
[181:31.19]Sneak Mage.
[181:32.77]Oh shit, he just actually hit me.
[181:36.97]You're just so much more impressive than I am.
[181:40.31]It's embarrassing.
[181:46.11]That's not even that bad of a move.
[181:47.85]It really isn't.
[181:48.64]I just... It looks like such a joke that I feel like it doesn't hurt anybody, but it does.
[182:07.84]I hope they're picking these up, right?
[182:10.24]They have to be.
[182:10.96]We're so close.
[182:12.12]Who's left?

[204:13.88]Bit of health.
[204:16.23]Great deal of stamina.
[204:17.49]Whoa, this is 1500 gold.
[204:18.47]If I could just sell it.
[204:25.65]Pumpkin.
[204:28.01]This is just a bunch of money.
[204:32.32]Moldy carrot.
[204:38.76]Why is that one so expensive?
[204:45.83]Flask of oil.

[206:24.31]It's $18,000 for this.
[206:30.23]Why is this so expensive?
[206:37.56]I can't afford the only weapon I can use.
[206:39.36]Uh... Can I just sell one of the DLC things?
[207:09.66]I mean, it was just free money.
[207:10.74]It's cheating.
[207:17.30]They're only useful for selling.
[207:20.06]Yeah.
[207:21.38]Alright.

[208:15.85]Is that... Okay, you guys are going to be mad if I do this.
[208:24.49]No, yes, yes, yes, no, yes, yes.
[208:28.54]Don't do it.

[208:41.15]Fuck it, I don't even care.
[208:44.35]What will it be, dude?
[208:45.17]Have your pick.

[209:21.01]And, you know, we got some money.
[209:22.53]Let's go on a little bit of a shopping spree here.
[209:25.29]How about, mmm, Feather Hood?
[209:28.43]Wizard's hat?
[209:30.24]Mmm, 8700.
[209:30.66]I got the means.
[209:36.88]Cheating in an easy game.
[209:38.36]That's not... but... Would you rather we just put it all on and be unkillable for the first, like, six hours of the game?
[209:48.05]Ooh, that's cool.
[209:55.30]Scholar's coat.
[209:56.84]Yeah, I want that too.
[210:02.98]I'm gonna buy stuff for Shito as well.

[211:28.94]Uh, buy three of them.
[211:30.27]What do you mean, what?
[211:31.87]You don't equip sub pawns.
[211:36.66]What?
[211:39.98]I don't equip sub-pawns.
[211:45.46]Oh, goddammit.
[211:46.29]Okay, hold on.
[211:46.99]I only got one of those.
[211:51.73]Only your pawn and you.
[211:53.11]So what do they have?
[212:06.81]Alright.
[212:07.13]Okay.
[212:07.35]Alright.
[212:07.73]We're good.

[212:16.97]Two boots.
[212:19.11]One wrap.
[212:20.11]One glove.
[212:26.95]Yeah, this is much better.
[212:31.59]Very nice.
[212:32.13]Okay.
[212:32.64]And your helmet.
[212:33.62]Put it on.
[212:37.50]44.
[212:37.54]Really not much of an increase, but it's fine.
[212:39.78]Uh, this is from me.
[212:50.06]And a cloak.
[212:53.93]Back to me.
[212:54.39]I need... Enhance.
[212:58.61]What does this mean?
[213:03.76]A plain wooden arch staff with simple design and ready availability have made it a common sight across the... 1,300 bucks just to upgrade it once?
[213:13.90]That's not bad.
[213:15.04]Is that... that's... just do it.
[213:21.32]Level 1, sure.
[213:28.67]Alright, nice.
[213:32.86]What about you?
[213:33.28]70 gold?
[213:33.96]840 gold, do it.
[213:41.14]And then the bow?
[213:45.69]59 and 65.
[213:50.73]He's gonna upgrade stuff and think regular items are bad.
[213:53.99]Calling it.
[213:54.63]No, I'm not.
[213:56.54]That's not gonna happen.
[213:57.16]Alright, I'm gonna put on my last thing and then we can keep going.
[214:03.57]Where are those, uh... They... Can I give this?
[214:14.29]How do I take that from you?
[214:21.56]Shido's holding it.
[214:23.18]Give it here.
[214:33.45]Okay.
[214:34.69]Now the boots, too.
[214:35.53]Give a pair of boots.
[214:42.03]We're so close.
[214:45.74]So this is 143, these ones.
[214:51.08]And then where are those plus ones to magic?
[214:54.50]What the fuck are those things?
[214:58.88]What the hell was it?
[215:00.50]Did I not give it?
[215:04.94]There they are.
[215:06.88]No, no, no, no.
[215:07.54]Stupid.
[215:10.96]Alright.
[215:12.85]Almost done.
[215:14.97]Plus one to magic.
[215:18.01]Good.
[215:19.83]Grand.
[215:20.89]Perfect.
[215:21.91]Alright.
[215:26.72]Now I look like a real sorcerer.
[215:30.32]What's the basic attack?
[215:32.14]Okay, it's just this stupid thing.
[215:39.30]Now let's go on a quest.
[215:43.13]Uh-huh.
[215:43.77]Consult the guards and visit the Pawn Guild on the western side of the capital.
[215:52.95]Okay.
[215:54.43]Did I do that?
[215:57.01]Well, this is West, so... Guards on the West.
[216:00.39]Hi, guys.
[216:00.87]Pay the Pawn Guild a visit.
[216:01.85]Please save.
[216:02.21]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[216:29.61]That was a huge jump, holy shit.
[216:31.11]Alright, hey, how are you?
[216:32.59]Don't fuck around, alright?
[216:35.77]Alright, so... Yeah, I got all the moves that I can learn right now.
[216:39.23]I'm at level one sorcerer.
[216:58.97]I can run really fast.
[217:01.71]Wait, what is this?
[217:02.39]Question mark?
[217:02.79]Where's my other... Where's, um... Where's shit at... Where's poop butt?
[217:11.52]No, who am I looking for?
[217:12.44]Who's missing?
[217:14.24]Did somebody die?
[217:18.55]Oh, it's, uh, feet.
[217:20.37]Hamburger feet.
[217:21.11]Where's hamburger feet?
[217:22.57]You can summon pawns as necessity demands.
[217:24.81]The rift represents the bond between pawn and arisen.
[217:28.44]Do take some advantage.
[217:32.38]Don't remember her name.
[217:33.78]Welcome, arisen.
[217:35.30]We have awaited your coming.
[217:36.80]This pawn is called Barnaby.
[217:38.68]Barnaby!
[217:40.84]The guild serves as a place of rest for pawns and as the gate to the Everfall.
[217:45.75]The Everfall lies beneath Grand Sorin.
[217:48.71]is a place of great importance to our kind.
[217:51.71]Okay.
[217:52.71]But for now, let us rejoice in the coming of the Arisen, the light that guides the Legion.
[217:59.93]I learned what to do in this quest.
[218:04.97]Have you?
[218:05.49]So what is it?
[218:06.53]What do we need to do?
[218:07.77]Let's talk.
[218:08.93]Good, we found it.
[218:12.97]Good, we found it.
[218:15.17]Good, we found it.
[218:18.15]Good.
[218:18.73]So, I'm not replacing.
[218:20.83]Should I replace somebody?
[218:22.37]No, no, no.
[218:23.43]I don't want the level 60.
[218:29.67]No, we're out of here.
[218:48.01]I need a... Actually, I do... No, I do need a healer.
[218:50.23]You're right.
[218:53.76]Hamburger feeder Gabe has to go.
[218:57.36]Because I don't have any heals.
[218:58.38]Wait, what?
[219:19.23]Give?
[219:21.96]Select an item to gift.
[219:23.78]Well, who am I?
[219:24.56]What am I?
[219:25.30]Give you what?
[219:46.25]Okay, so I'm giving him a review.
[219:47.79]Okay, review.
[219:48.29]Appearance, battle, and helpfulness.
[219:59.04]That's toxic?
[220:04.20]But was he helpful?
[220:05.40]I don't remember him doing anything.
[220:06.58]Alright, but it's Gabe Newell, okay?
[220:13.41]Appearance rating...
[220:15.55]Although, hold on a minute, though.
[220:16.41]This character may have been made in 2011.
[220:19.63]So this actually could be pretty relevant for that period that he was made.
[220:23.55]Okay.
[220:24.45]Battle rating.
[220:26.35]You have, like, a circle shield and a knife.
[220:35.60]That's pretty helpful.
[220:36.32]That's fine.
[220:36.84]Okay.
[220:36.96]Comments.
[220:37.98]Comments.
[220:48.52]There you go.
[220:49.59]Shows fine taste.
[220:56.21]Alright.
[220:58.71]Bye, Gabe.
[221:04.15]Hamburger feed lives another day.
[221:06.23]Alright, now we need a healer.
[221:08.57]Level 10.
[221:14.10]What are we, level 7?
[221:16.35]She's level four.
[221:17.43]Well, she's got plenty of room to grow.
[221:19.37]Wait, like level five, level six?
[221:21.51]Let's go for six.
[221:25.61]Why is she only level four?
[221:31.21]Okay, we need a mage, right?
[221:32.61]Yeah, bring them all in.
[221:36.55]Let's get a good name.
[221:43.71]Abel, Clarice, Hilda, Nun, Felice, Ada, Jack, Goblin, uh-uh.
[221:54.34]Uh, Fanny.
[221:55.32]Let's pull Fanny in.
[222:01.92]Uh, Mila.
[222:07.88]Let's get another one.
[222:08.82]I want to get another list.
[222:09.82]I didn't like that list very much.
[222:12.22]Uh, Bebe.
[222:14.86]Four, five, six.
[222:17.36]BB.
[222:23.13]Barbara?
[222:28.83]Uh... I need to check and see if they have healing spells.
[222:37.12]And, um... Barbara.
[222:39.90]Bring him in.
[222:44.64]What are you still doing here?
[222:47.60]There's Fanny.
[222:51.48]There's 4, 5, 6.
[222:51.88]There's BB.
[222:52.30]Why 4, 5?
[222:52.70]Did you just get lazy?
[222:55.65]Alright, what do you got?
[223:15.98]General information, offensive statuses, defense skills.
[223:20.26]Okay.
[223:21.10]Here's a- there's a heal.
[223:36.07]Hold on.
[223:39.05]Er- I need like another lit.

[224:55.52]You stick around for a second.
[225:02.15]That's a person's first and last fucking name.
[225:06.07]I don't want it.
[225:06.55]Let's see.
[225:16.93]There's absolutely no fucking way I'm going to click on any of those.

[225:29.41]Stay.
[225:35.64]Alright, we're gonna find it here.
[225:42.16]Loki!
[225:42.66]Alright, I need to see what Loki looks like.
[225:50.96]Slayer Head?
[225:56.64]What is Slayer Head?
[226:00.08]Hi guys.
[226:03.90]And Elaine.
[226:06.61]Have to pick one from here.
[226:18.49]This is just a guy.
[226:20.46]That's just a guy in like a nun outfit.
[226:28.88]Alright, well there's Slayer Head.
[226:31.94]No.
[226:34.27]Loki.
[226:34.79]Hi, guys.
[226:37.01]I don't
[226:46.07]Let's just... Alright.
[226:51.27]You have a healing spell.
[226:53.21]Sarah, what are you doing here?
[226:58.30]Get out of here.
[226:59.06]Loki, dude, or high guides.
[227:07.30]Yes, sir.
[227:09.21]This is supposed to be Loki from Super Marvel 64.
[227:13.59]Alright.
[227:15.41]Hi.
[227:16.99]I think it's gonna have to be Loki.
[227:21.31]Loki has so much better moves.
[227:22.41]His moves are amazing.
[227:31.62]Take them both?
[227:33.32]That means I have to get rid of a hamburger feet.
[227:42.91]Alright, let's go.
[227:43.59]You're coming with me.
[227:48.65]He doesn't have a funny hat.
[227:52.64]Oh, I forgot how important that was.
[227:54.48]You're right.
[228:01.62]She's level 4 and can't grow.
[228:03.37]Is that for real?
[228:21.78]I mean, you saw at least four or five times where she did something fucking crazy.
[228:49.08]Friend request.
[228:53.32]This pawn stands proud of what we accomplished.
[228:55.80]May our paths cross again.
[228:57.97]Alright, bye.
[229:00.47]Bye, Jaina Proudmoore's voice actor.
[229:02.37]Alright, we got Dude, and then we're also gonna get, uh, we're gonna get Dude and Loki.
[229:08.79]Both of them.
[229:10.61]No, now we need a fucking tank.
[229:19.73]Yes, I risen.
[229:27.28]Let's go.
[229:27.86]What is your voice?
[229:31.18]I'm gonna be able to understand what that person is saying.
[229:55.11]Then we got Mage, Better Mage, Tank.
[230:00.04]Now we got Healer, Better Sorcerer, Range.
[230:03.64]We're good.
[230:04.28]Let's go.
[230:07.40]He's got a normie voice.
[230:09.11]Well, it's actually refreshing.
[230:10.77]That's not even normie voice.
[230:14.69]When everything is... That's abnormal to hear that.
[230:24.23]When all you hear is this the whole entire stream... The guy that has a normal voice is different.
[230:32.37]Who the hell are you?
[230:39.38]Send friend request?
[230:40.60]Who the fuck is this?
[230:41.36]Alright, can we go?
[230:45.80]Yeah.
[230:55.14]Random pawns that walk around.
[230:56.66]That's really actually pretty cool.
[231:04.23]Why didn't they make a sequel to this game?
[231:06.11]Were they too busy making Monster Hunter: World?
[231:07.99]Probably.
[231:08.33]Oh, they did make an online one.
[231:16.39]Capcom just hates us.
[231:17.63]Oh.
[231:26.47]This game has a 33 on Metacritic?
[231:27.89]No, it does not.
[231:28.73]That's not even possible.
[231:57.05]What are you talking about?
[231:57.77]Hold on.
[232:01.21]Metacritic.
[232:02.23]Dragon's Dogma.
[232:04.81]Metacritic.
[232:13.07]It's got like an 80.
[232:14.15]What are you talking about?
[232:16.07]A 33%?
[232:18.73]That means the game doesn't even function.
[232:21.11]That's like the game crashes to desktop when you open it.
[232:24.02]That's how you get a 33.
[232:24.46]You got it.
[232:24.68]Explore the Everfall.
[232:25.24]You guys ready?
[232:25.98]Miasma.
[232:54.48]Oh, fuck.
[233:02.81]Look at these corridors.
[233:03.87]This is... Thanks, poop butt.
[233:09.83]Thank you.
[233:10.89]Appreciate that.
[233:11.57]Uh, I need my equipment.
[233:19.09]How do I, um... Oh, it's select.
[233:24.68]Alright, I only have one.
[233:25.66]I got a lantern.
[233:26.76]Use it.
[233:28.54]Let's go.
[233:28.92]Gotta search down here.
[233:41.56]That's a long way down.
[233:53.11]They all walk off.
[233:55.06]No, they won't.
[233:57.52]Okay, I was just checking if they were like lemmings.
[234:05.90]Jump for the item.
[234:06.86]Oh fuck, there is an item!
[234:36.13]Did he just say, so hungry?
[234:38.51]So hungry.
[234:39.09]I got the sauce, okay.
[235:07.43]How do I load game?
[235:16.40]You don't.
[235:22.80]You have to live with it.
[235:27.93]I need that guy.
[235:28.95]Really badly.
[235:48.20]I'm reaching the hand up.
[236:00.96]No, please don't take me Lord.
[236:03.44]Alright.
[236:09.20]Last save game.
[236:13.39]This is the first 30 minutes of the game.
[236:15.33]Not when you... Not when you spend, like, two hours making characters.
[236:21.75]Wait, I didn't get the... Oh, fuck.
[236:22.79]Okay, I got it.
[236:24.15]I got the sauce.
[236:45.48]Let's go.
[236:47.36]First mission of the game.
[236:49.28]It's only taken four hours.
[236:52.07]Bugs!
[236:52.71]Alright, we got it.
[236:53.19]Nice work.
[237:16.84]so much faster.
[237:17.54]You guys were right.
[237:20.40]It was definitely worth picking this.
[237:22.44]Got him.
[237:46.86]What the hell was that?
[237:51.27]That's a different move.
[237:54.45]Like a pushback?
[238:02.21]It's a force push.
[238:03.27]That's really cool.
[238:03.93]Alright.
[238:04.21]Cool.
[238:08.05]Watch out.
[238:08.43]Watch out!
[238:08.85]Don't fall!
[238:09.29]What are you doing?
[238:10.73]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[238:12.77]Watch out.
[238:13.23]I'm just trying to do something.
[238:18.76]I just want to see if it... It's so strong.
[238:30.65]I don't even do a damn thing.
[238:31.63]Nice heal.
[238:35.95]Thank god that guy exists.
[238:36.99]Alright, we got... Zombies?
[238:41.47]Yeah, I don't even hurt them.
[238:42.53]We got men no longer.
[238:48.09]Oh, I got enchantment.
[238:50.35]I hate this guy.
[238:52.07]This guy has a fucking hat on.
[239:11.80]That's the only reason why this guy is interesting.
[239:13.86]To all of you.
[239:14.36]It's because he's wearing a funny hat.
[239:16.70]And that's just the DLC hat.
[239:18.38]Okay.
[239:18.72]Chest.
[239:21.82]Throw one off again.
[239:24.42]I don't think I'm going... I'm not going to throw somebody off.
[239:41.23]Controlled by some kind of device.
[239:43.53]Which is back in this part.
[239:52.70]Are there, like, illusory walls?
[239:53.96]I don't even know why I'm asking that question.
[240:01.19]Roll somebody off and then try to catch them.
[240:07.26]Poison.
[240:11.22]Um... Lightning's not doing so much.
[240:17.80]Fire?
[240:19.18]Who the fuck is dead?
[240:25.70]Everyone's getting their ass kicked!
[240:34.25]What the fuck is happening right now?
[240:40.62]Yeah, the lightning does not work at all.
[240:48.85]It's all about fire.
[240:51.15]That's never gonna get old.
[241:19.94]We have triumphed.
[241:21.52]We have triumphed.
[241:23.02]We have triumphed.
[241:25.74]He's hearing the same line three different times.
[241:27.74]I don't know what happened there.
[241:42.62]I got fire in shape and now that's good.
[241:44.38]Thank you for learning about that.
[241:46.96]Holy shit, didn't I?
[241:49.32]It doesn't matter if you're holding them.
[241:50.68]No one's there.
[241:55.18]He's holding it again.
[242:00.50]Come on, man.
[242:14.64]Will you heal him?
[242:17.26]We need to heal.
[242:19.12]He's so passionate.
[242:20.23]Yeah, he is.
[242:22.63]He's really good at holding enemies still.
[242:28.43]Leather circlet.
[242:34.21]Alright, now that I've opened this door, yep.
[242:49.34]I wonder what the normie character is thinking.
[242:54.10]Probably not very much, considering he does have that hat on.
[242:57.44]Oh god.
[243:03.16]I feel like I'm not doing much damage, even with the regular fireball.
[243:14.74]The melee's gonna take this on here.
[243:26.11]He is a normie, though.
[243:27.31]That's like the normie hat?
[243:28.59]I don't believe that.
[243:29.41]And why am I saying normie?
[243:40.72]Okay, we got... Nah, I can pull that.
[243:42.88]That closes this.
[243:43.84]That's locked now.
[243:44.78]That's fine.
[243:54.94]Walking bolts!
[244:00.76]Vocation for Shido increased.
[244:04.89]Good.
[244:14.63]Now fire on these zombies.
[244:16.81]Very very good.
[244:17.59]Very very good.
[244:25.05]I shall restore your health.
[244:29.61]What a gaff.
[244:56.00]They're so annoying.
[244:58.20]They really are.
[244:58.96]Quickly!
[245:02.52]It's locked.
[245:03.00]Oh, shit.
[245:03.38]Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, don't just go after it.
[245:16.95]Did you just blow me a kiss?
[245:18.49]What the hell was that?
[245:19.67]Oh, okay.
[245:21.78]Get ready.
[245:30.91]Get him!
[245:33.25]Get him!
[245:34.33]Get him!
[245:38.75]Oh.
[245:45.45]Holy shit.
[245:46.99]Did he knock him off the... Oh, wait.
[245:51.17]Healer, healer, healer.
[245:52.04]Get the healer up.
[245:54.80]Where's Poopbutt?
[245:55.63]There he is.
[245:58.79]Oh my god, this is bad.
[246:01.49]This is really bad.
[246:03.57]What do you propose?
[246:21.46]Intuitible, sir.
[246:25.27]How long is this going to take?
[246:30.73]Think well before striking.
[246:32.12]Oh, come on.
[246:51.29]What do you propose?
[246:54.05]Not much, apparently.
[247:01.60]Let's continue.
[247:11.74]Gamer alert.
[247:13.38]Accidental gamer alert.
[247:14.56]Healing powers.
[247:24.16]That's definitely a save scenario.
[247:34.87]Watch out.
[247:35.39]Bugs.
[247:37.55]Bats.
[247:37.87]Watch there be another troll right here.
[247:46.96]Hmm.
[247:51.46]What's that?
[247:57.47]How much further down would you go?
[248:02.63]Good shot.
[248:03.63]Really good aim I got there.
[248:05.53]Advance slowly where visibility is poor.
[248:07.79]It will give us time to react.
[248:11.24]Somebody swap this bat, please.
[248:19.78]Looks as though what doors were closed stand open.
[248:22.95]And those once open are now closed.
[248:24.77]This place hides something.
[248:26.75]Shall we take a look?
[248:27.28]Speaking of fucking riddles... Some doors are open when others close.
[248:37.58]Others open while others are closed.
[248:39.46]I thought that just said, please save the game over there.
[248:53.28]Give me a fire, there you go.
[248:57.92]Nice work, dude.
[248:58.90]I gotta give more curators to them, so they can take care of themselves.
[249:18.89]Rusted wood?
[249:19.53]What is it?
[249:19.91]Rusted wood?
[249:20.69]Large nuts.
[249:21.57]What?
[249:21.81]Ooh, hey.
[249:23.65]I'm just picking up rocks.
[249:25.35]I'm so fucking useful, huh?
[249:26.49]There's really only one way to go, guys.
[249:31.00]It's around the circle and down.
[249:33.92]What was that?
[249:35.04]A ladder?
[249:54.81]I can't even replicate that voice.
[249:56.65]It's too hard to do that.
[250:04.87]Why are you going the long way?
[250:06.79]He went all the way around.
[250:09.63]Nice try.
[250:22.94]Had enough of him to save me.
[250:24.78]He jumped over the railing.
[250:27.48]Alright, cool.
[250:30.43]Get some money?
[250:31.41]You questioning my strategic placement here of characters?
[250:50.44]Was I getting leadership advice from Poop Butt?

[251:04.99]Flame Servant's Throne.
[251:07.81]Are we ready?
[251:08.25]Alright, just check the area a little bit.
[251:13.41]It's probably a boss.

[252:04.16]I sense monsters back.
[252:07.12]Report back?
[252:10.24]I have to... Report crystals work in tandem with fairy stones.
[252:15.67]Invent this port crystal in the ground any place safe a dungeon.
[252:20.73]And you can use a fairy stone to return there in an instant.
[252:23.11]Okay.
[252:23.45]Alright, we gotta fight here.
[252:32.17]Why are you going up the stairs?
[252:40.83]Why are you retreating?

[253:54.32]Come on!
[253:58.31]Let's go!
[254:07.93]Stop fighting!

[255:10.13]I keep- I need to eat the stamina thing.
[255:21.98]Where is it?
[255:22.76]Stamina.
[255:23.44]Use it.
[255:45.15]They're trying to sacrifice themselves for you.
[255:47.95]They're good.
[255:56.24]I think they're all alive.
[256:03.36]No, wait, eat, eat, ah.
[256:19.98]No, come on, poop butt, hurry up.
[256:23.12]I'll strike his tentacles.
[256:53.05]Let's speak with Barnaby Leave it to me
[257:23.43]This game is out of control.
[257:26.37]Sit at the special chair to mentor your main pawn.
[257:31.07]You can give direction on how you would like them to act in battle while out in the field.
[257:35.51]Similarly, you can also advise your main pawn how you would like them to speak to you in the knowledge chair.
[257:41.57]I am ever aware of the enemy's weakness in battle, be they alone or in numbers.
[257:53.79]Sure.
[257:53.99]Um...
[258:19.94]But what does that even mean?
[258:22.08]That could mean every single scenario.
[258:24.82]I try to speak or remain silent as the situation demands.
[258:31.06]That's every single possible scenario.
[258:38.48]I speak sometimes, but sometimes I'm silent.
[258:40.48]Do you want me to do that still?
[258:41.74]Sure.
[258:42.38]As you wish.
[258:43.36]I will attempt to be more talkative from now on.
[258:47.51]Oh no, that's not what I wanted.
[258:48.95]Meek, arrogant, ordinary, as you are.
[258:49.95]Speak with confidence.
[258:50.57]Ordinary.
[259:21.32]How should I voice my anguish?
[259:26.04]If my left arm is ripped off, should I scream with confidence?
[259:31.75]Anguish?
[259:32.91]What would please you?
[259:43.06]If a group of ogres smear shit all over me and then burn me alive,
[259:49.49]How should I respond to them?
[259:50.45]So this is the Pawn Guild.
[259:52.77]A light in the furthest depths, you say?
[259:56.83]I see.
[260:02.48]In truth, even we pawns know precious little of the Everfall.
[260:08.42]I can say with utmost certainty, though, the light you speak of is newly come.
[260:13.67]My character runs like a toddler.
[260:14.81]We cannot know if this small aberration will give rise to great calamity hence.
[260:19.49]He is pretty small.
[260:20.77]But the chance enough is called to take action.
[260:23.37]We shall redouble our efforts here and keep vigilant for further signs of change.
[260:29.33]That's a $50.
[260:30.89]That's 5,000 bits just came in right now.
[260:33.21]50 bucks.
[260:35.57]Big bits.
[260:37.35]From a wild Merrill.
[260:40.35]Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[260:44.63]And they say, been watching your streams for a while now.
[260:46.33]Just wanted to say thanks for what you do.
[260:48.50]You never fail to make me laugh, even when I'm feeling at my worst.
[260:51.48]Keep doing what you do.
[260:52.56]Thanks again.
[260:55.90]Thank you for watching.
[261:01.55]Really appreciate it.
[261:02.37]Thank you for the huge amount of fucking money.
[261:04.75]Thank you for the massive amount of money.
[261:10.37]I'm glad you can have fun here.
[261:13.72]Thank you.
[261:15.40]Dude is still here.
[261:16.00]Alright.
[261:16.36]New spells!
[261:18.58]You have to imagine that I'm gonna throw Dude off a cliff.
[261:21.46]Eventually.
[261:46.26]Yes?
[261:46.60]What is it?
[261:47.24]Are you the Arisen?
[261:48.34]I bring a message from the Duke himself.
[261:51.38]His Grace has judged your feat in slaying the Hydra most laudable.
[261:57.49]The worm hunt?
[261:57.99]It was laughable?
[261:58.67]Okay.
[262:25.25]That's a really great default NPC pathing run.
[262:32.75]Excellent work, guy.
[262:34.88]Cool.
[262:38.02]Who the fuck is this?
[262:55.22]Hello.
[262:57.02]Yes, Arisen.
[263:07.26]Yes, Arisen.
[263:11.46]Duke Edmund Dragonsbane is a hero.
[263:13.86]He slewed the worm a generation past.
[263:19.22]No, no.
[263:20.16]I got a great team here.
[263:21.50]They tried.
[263:21.86]No, wrong person.
[263:22.72]They're just stealing.
[263:23.58]They're just taking things from this guy's house.
[263:28.46]This looks interesting.
[263:29.68]Yeah, it's also not yours.
[263:48.76]Remember, it's because you're on... I talk more frequently now.
[263:58.05]This looks interesting.
[264:01.01]Sir, I... I know it is not a matter fit to thrust upon a passing stranger, but...
[264:11.21]Yeah, there's like a mourning family in here.
[264:14.55]And you just went and took a bunch of shit from their house.
[264:16.39]Please, I ask only that you listen a while.
[264:20.04]Thank you, sir.
[264:21.16]This child is my son.
[264:25.18]Was my son.
[264:26.94]His heart stopped not a few hours past.
[264:29.90]Always weak, his sweetheart.
[264:32.88]Since he was but a babe.
[264:35.28]I had long known he would not live long.
[264:38.25]What the fuck is this person doing with the crate?
[264:40.81]But to see it, to watch him slip from my grasp, I am left with naught but rage at my impotence.
[264:49.93]That guy part of the house raid here?
[264:53.22]He saw us do it and he came in and just grabbed like a bunch of clothes.
[264:55.96]Fain to try any means that I might to bring him back, I look to magic, even curses.
[265:04.00]Anything to bring him back to me.
[265:06.92]I know it for madness, but still I... Here.
[265:10.38]Pray.
[265:11.34]Accept these, sir.
[265:13.22]The first of those stones I bought from a merchant my son and I passed in our travels.
[265:19.27]He spoke of a powerful magic within it.
[265:22.43]Gather rocks such as this together, he said, and even the dead shall wake.
[265:27.59]So we gotta make an undead sun.
[265:30.76]This is gonna be crazy.
[265:33.75]Big Marsh, 10 community subs.
[265:35.81]Thank you, Big Marsh.
[265:41.89]$50.
[265:41.91]In a different way.
[265:44.60]Thank you.
[265:50.82]Thank you guys so much.
[265:51.88]For real.
[265:54.30]Dropping fucking big money.
[265:59.22]Money laundering.
[266:03.08]I had a change of heart.
[266:04.68]He's bringing it back.
[266:07.12]His mother yelled at him outside.
[266:08.41]He's refilling the box.
[266:09.65]He's not sorry.
[266:11.17]He's just bringing it back and filling it up again.
[266:33.87]Wake stones are miraculous items that can bring your character, pawn allies, or others back to life.
[266:40.08]Treasure each wake stone for the fragments required to form them are quite rare, and each stone can only be used once.
[266:47.18]Gather enough wake stone shards and they will automatically assemble to form a complete stone.
[266:52.04]Deliver a wake stone to Austin.
[267:01.92]There was water.
[267:11.08]I was trying to wake him up with water.
[267:12.88]Maybe he was like just asleep.
[267:14.40]What if he just whipped his head up like, what the hell?
[267:19.77]Alright, let's go.
[267:22.03]Let's take a look.
[267:34.03]So I guess I don't... That's not necessarily a quest as much as it is just bring one back.
[267:49.38]I know, I guess it is.
[267:52.46]No.
[267:53.52]It's just pointing to me.
[268:06.00]I'm going the mage route?
[268:06.88]Yeah, I am.
[268:08.49]At least initially here.
[268:11.89]So... Where... What do I do?
[268:15.21]Ah, I want to go... I want to go to the inn.
[268:18.11]Because I have new stuff to do.
[268:20.97]New spells I can put on.
[268:26.85]Yeah, rank three.
[268:27.69]Oh, I gotta turn the lantern off?
[268:34.71]Yeah.
[268:42.45]Okay, this is the armory.
[268:44.51]Where's the inn?
[268:45.11]Right there.
[268:50.53]Are you gonna do a full playthrough?
[268:57.01]Uh, I'm not sure.
[269:00.83]I'm still very interested.
[269:03.06]You know, if I'm still having fun and it's still interesting to me, then of course I'll probably just keep going until I don't necessarily care anymore, which I still care now.
[269:12.24]Okay, so learn or set new skills.
[269:14.08]Learn skills, there we go.
[269:14.62]Lassitude.
[269:15.18]A magical fog at a desired location that inflicts torpor upon foes who enter.
[269:32.63]Torpor.
[269:35.67]Fire Boon, Ice Boon, Thunder Boon, Holy Boon.
[269:38.29]High Miasma.
[269:42.00]Spends the size of the Poisonous Fog and endures for a longer period of time.
[269:48.80]High Eleven.
[269:51.00]High Ingle.
[269:52.49]How much do I have?
[269:53.75]700?
[269:53.83]I mean, why not?
[269:58.95]Just a better version of it.
[270:03.70]And lassitude?
[270:04.82]I don't even know what the hell that does.
[270:10.20]Let's try it.
[270:15.69]Ice.
[270:20.23]These boons, I really should probably put one on.
[270:27.72]Holy boon?
[270:29.42]Holy light?
[270:30.88]Maybe.
[270:33.00]Yeah, let's get it.
[270:35.83]And then maybe Ice Boon?
[270:36.83]I'll get Ice Boon.
[270:52.64]Frazzle.
[270:54.82]That's not bad.
[270:55.58]I'm gonna have the points.
[270:56.82]Might as well just get it.
[270:57.46]Okay, we got Biting Wind.
[270:59.90]Cutting Wind.
[271:00.60]An advanced form of Biting Wind.
[271:02.26]Let's get that.
[271:05.37]Dazzle Hold.
[271:09.11]Stun.
[271:10.15]Sprint.
[271:12.85]Helm Splitter.
[271:14.57]Reset.
[271:28.19]Oh shit, I have another one.
[271:30.99]Core skills.
[271:32.03]Oh no, I don't know.
[271:34.41]I guess I just unlocked these.
[271:38.56]Mitigates gravity's pull, enabling a gentle landing even from great heights.
[271:46.22]Augments the power of magic attacks designed to knock down foes.
[271:50.50]Negotiate higher prices for items that you sell.
[271:54.23]Greatly reduces damage sustained in magic attacks.
[271:58.06]Okay.
[272:01.94]Well, let's change these skills.
[272:04.96]High angle, high 11, and... Maybe, like, holy boon?
[272:11.02]Just so I can make sure I have it.
[272:13.95]What about secondary?
[272:17.51]I'll put the boons on secondary.
[272:18.97]Let's try latitude.
[272:26.33]Yeah, because these are, like, little buffs.
[272:32.63]Now you, Cutting Wind.
[272:34.37]Wait, Scarlet Kiss.
[272:40.34]Oh, Cutting Wind is already on.
[272:41.34]So Dazzle Hold or Scarlet Kiss?
[272:44.46]Dazzle Hold, probably that one.
[272:48.35]A little bit of utility.
[272:54.65]What will it be today?
[272:57.13]Core scales are new combos and improvements.
[272:59.09]You and your pawn can use them all after learning them.
[273:01.61]No need to equip those.
[273:02.71]Oh, okay.
[273:03.79]That's cool.
[273:06.02]A broad ranged flurry of dagger blows.
[273:09.94]Deadly double strike forward.
[273:14.06]Grave quickloose.
[273:16.94]That's cool.
[273:17.30]And I'll get this one too.
[273:25.07]So dazzle, hold.
[273:26.11]I need augments.
[273:29.41]Wait, what?
[273:29.83]I don't have to put those.
[273:38.47]They're just on.
[273:46.55]They're just passives.
[273:47.27]Okay.
[273:48.39]So they're just on.
[273:48.85]Okay, that's cool.
[273:49.63]Understood.
[273:58.55]Is there a amount of core skills you're allowed to have?
[274:02.00]Or can I just, all of them are just passive and they can all stay on?
[274:06.26]Your follower has returned from assisting another Arisen in another realm.
[274:15.69]What is 3500 RC?
[274:23.99]A weapon bearing no maker's mark, cursed with blackest magic.
[274:31.08]Did somebody just give me one of the rarest things in the game?
[274:35.40]Did I just get a stream snipe gift?
[274:37.31]Yeah, is this a stream snipe gift?
[274:52.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[274:54.01]No, no, no, no.
[274:54.57]I don't... Is that going to, like, level Shito up, like, 500 times?
[275:03.52]I don't think I want to do this.
[275:14.77]You're fine.
[275:15.23]So I can say yes.
[275:15.99]It's not going to be a problem?
[275:18.09]It's fine.
[275:18.71]It's fine.
[275:19.11]Okay, okay.
[275:27.65]Five stars.
[275:28.91]What's the message?
[275:31.79]No message.
[275:32.27]You...
[275:57.10]You progress through the game by completing quests.
[275:58.74]I always talk to the people you meet that surely have... I might have to turn... I don't think I'm gonna turn online off.

[277:25.62]Okay.
[277:28.16]So, I need to... Quest.
[277:31.78]I don't really have anything right now.
[277:33.00]I have this, but I just have to do it.
[277:38.20]Map.
[277:38.60]I think I just have to talk to people?
[277:40.88]Let's go on a talking mission.
[277:48.08]Even at its worst, the world is ever home to hope.
[277:59.13]I need green question marks.
[278:03.51]Are they stealing more money?
[278:05.15]We're like to have dealings with the armorer here for some time to come.
[278:09.96]The pawn guild stands for him.
[278:12.34]No.
[278:12.80]Where shall we head?
[278:14.26]Green, green, green.
[278:15.30]Wasn't there a guy in here that had a green?
[278:16.44]What is this guy?
[278:18.58]That's red.
[278:19.68]A stone to recall the dead to living.
[278:22.84]You stones red as blood, ensorcelled with arcane magic.
[278:29.13]Strange you should mention it.
[278:30.85]I heard tell a traveling merchant found one in a cave a few days past.
[278:36.42]It may come to naught, but you might seek the stone on the shelves of Grand Sorin's shops.
[278:42.06]Really?
[278:44.70]You can summon pawns as necessity demands here at the pawn guild.
[278:51.14]So somebody's selling it.
[279:07.76]I don't know.
[279:08.24]Somebody's selling this thing?
[279:09.42]What's it called?
[279:11.39]Wake stone?
[279:12.13]Wake stone.
[279:44.49]You got nothing?
[279:56.06]Alright, well let's... I don't know if I'm supposed to be able to do that right now.
[280:01.00]Barber?
[280:04.27]Barber shop.
[280:12.87]No, this is just... This is just to change your hair.
[280:16.34]Is this the X on the map?
[280:25.54]No, that's my X. I put it on there.
[280:30.02]I've not even gone down here.
[280:31.02]Merchant's house.
[280:32.44]Wait a minute.
[280:46.86]Wakestone.
[280:47.96]Where?
[280:48.22]Let's open up the map again.
[281:05.46]Let me zoom it out.
[281:06.38]Okay.
[281:10.14]This is the Pawn Guild.
[281:11.34]This is the inn.
[281:16.93]Craftsman quarter.
[281:18.61]I feel like I have to go somewhere I haven't been.
[281:21.13]I don't think I've been up here.
[281:38.42]Go up to the castle?
[281:39.28]OK, well, we'll just mark it.
[281:50.07]Is this a backseating stream, or is he gonna figure it out for himself?
[281:53.83]Uh, it's kind of a... It's alright.
[281:56.15]It's a little of both.
[282:00.12]I mean, if I'm just looking around for the next place to go, then... This is a cheating... Well, I mean, I did already take the free money, so...
[282:23.62]Can you kill something?
[282:25.90]Alright.
[282:30.60]Here we are.
[282:31.46]Now I need to go in here.
[282:34.58]Maybe.
[282:46.69]No, I'm not killing anybody here.
[282:49.49]No one in here.
[283:03.17]Hey, look!
[283:05.99]Ah, arisen.
[283:07.27]My men have told me much of you.
[283:08.83]Throw somebody?
[283:09.25]I've expected your visit.
[283:10.49]No, no, no, no, no.
[283:11.91]I am Sir Maximilian Eisenstern, Captain of the Hunt, so named by His Grace Duke Edmund Dragonsbate.
[283:18.12]I beg your forbearance whilst I detail what is expected of you in the hunt.
[283:21.60]The wormhunt license you carry permits the bearer to undertake the most vital of tasks.
[283:27.06]With those missions given by Duke Edmund himself, of late, all our will is focused on learning of and defending against the wicked dragon.
[283:34.54]A weighty task, to be sure, but one which the fate of the realm and its people rests upon.
[283:40.58]I am under orders to lend Arisen all reasonable aid as they might require.
[283:44.56]I would pray you return this assistance in kind.
[283:47.30]It would be my honor to show you the ready charges for the worm hunt.
[283:50.28]The choice is yours.
[283:52.10]Okay, decipher a text, wrote a monster infestation, investigate a cult, aid a research team.
[284:00.01]I feel like this is the most boring one.
[284:08.51]Cult is interesting.
[284:09.39]I would probably pick cult.
[284:19.36]here are the details I fear this task is no simple call to action sir it will no doubt take time and a more subtle approach than your other work you can do them all now that's perhaps you've heard of the society they call salvation in truth most of what we know is the product of such hearsay they are a band of heretics who worship the dragon and welcome the perdition it brings in the chaos come with the worms arrival their influence has grown
[284:44.16]Pray, keep watch for signs of salvation as you go about your business.
[284:47.84]If you find one, tell me.
[284:49.50]Okay.
[284:49.88]Good.
[284:50.44]I'll rest easy affordably.
[284:52.68]After accepting the request, first note the quest marker on your map.
[284:55.79]Then continue by searching for the required items or information.
[285:00.59]Come here, Helen.
[285:00.95]Come here.
[285:02.35]It will be my honor to show you the ready.
[285:04.31]The choice is yours.
[285:05.27]Okay.
[285:05.87]And decipher a text.
[285:09.99]Certainly.
[285:11.01]I have important work for you.
[285:12.96]Okay.
[285:13.20]Alright.
[285:43.58]So I have two things to do now.
[285:47.04]Let's go take a look.
[285:50.05]We've got... Set one as the primary, yep.
[285:54.75]Pawns in your party will also offer advice for the priority quest.
[285:58.72]So we got the cipher and we got seeking salvation.
[286:03.38]Speak with Granthorn's citizenry to glean knowledge of the cult's activities.
[286:09.77]So I'm going to set this.
[286:11.13]So now I'm going to talk to people in town.
[286:16.25]But first, I haven't taken a break in five hours.
[286:18.92]So I'm going to go pee.
[286:19.72]I'm going to grab some more water.
[286:21.88]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[286:23.48]I will be right back.
[286:24.76]See you very soon.
[291:00.70]Okay.
[291:03.11]Hello.
[291:04.15]Yeah, I'm going to grab a water.
[291:15.57]Let's continue.
[291:16.45]You.
[291:17.34]What do you know?
[291:19.08]Oh.
[291:19.24]Never mind.
[291:19.92]It's you.
[291:20.46]Go away, weirdo.
[291:21.26]We're making Jupiters.
[291:30.50]Hey, don't call me a weirdo.
[291:35.44]Got two... How do I get the hell out of here?
[291:40.24]I guess this way.
[291:54.17]I appreciate the infinite stamina when you're in a town, though.
[291:57.45]I really do.
[291:59.23]You got more shit for me to do?
[292:01.79]You... You seem the type unlike to judge a man, but I would ask you a favor, sir.
[292:08.05]A wise choice.
[292:09.77]I warrant you'll be eager to hear what I have long searched for a certain tome.
[292:15.40]Salomet's Grimoire.
[292:18.20]Tis said its pages hold the power to grant the book itself is ensorcelled, you see.
[292:25.44]Even a novice is as a grand wizard with that grimoire in hand.
[292:30.11]I would ask you to seek it out.
[292:32.07]Recompense?
[292:33.55]Pray.
[292:35.31]Okay.
[292:37.13]This is an education stream.
[292:39.98]We have to learn.
[292:42.10]Learn, learn, learn.
[292:43.90]Ask, ask, ask.
[292:46.88]What do you know about the cult?
[292:49.62]You'll be one of Mason's friends, no doubt.
[292:54.43]Talk with Mason.
[292:55.61]It's like they're playing a different game.
[292:58.41]We're on a mission, we got stuff to do, and they just- they're doing their own world.
[293:24.54]Where is this?
[293:24.96]Mason?
[293:29.93]Where is this marker?
[293:39.03]Who is that guy?
[293:39.76]His name... He was actually Mason.
[293:56.39]Down here?
[293:56.87]No, I'm going the wrong way.
[294:14.88]No, how do I get over there?
[294:15.79]Is this a left?
[294:18.69]I can't go right here, can I?
[294:21.09]No.
[294:34.11]That was a fucking huge jump.
[294:38.59]Whatever you say.
[294:39.43]Alright.
[294:39.95]Where's this dude, Mason?
[294:41.28]That name is so familiar.
[294:42.22]No.
[294:42.28]Not you.
[295:08.96]Mason?
[295:10.12]I'm trying to keep focused.
[295:11.20]No.
[295:21.59]Mason.
[295:25.51]Where the hell are you?
[295:26.71]Hello.
[295:30.73]No, you're Albert.
[295:31.41]You're not the right guy.
[295:32.85]This shop bears a rather unwholesome look to it.
[295:38.82]This shop does?
[295:39.74]Hello.
[295:41.32]Yes, who is it?
[295:46.56]This is not... This isn't a... This is somebody's house.
[295:58.73]Look on the map.
[296:01.47]There's nothing on the map.
[296:02.33]I mean, that's... I put that waypoint there.
[296:06.83]There's nothing here.
[296:10.12]How far out is that?
[296:11.88]That little circle is there, but it's not on the actual map.
[296:23.82]Oh, it's right here.
[296:27.01]Why did they gray it out?
[296:35.35]Oh, Jesus.
[296:43.51]Oh, man.
[296:45.99]Alright, well, is it here?
[296:47.89]It's on a different elevation.
[296:57.56]Well, shit.
[297:04.00]Okay.
[297:10.67]Down in the sewers.
[297:13.68]How do I get in there?
[297:17.16]Like, in here?
[297:19.72]Oh god, am I alive?
[297:21.06]Hey, thanks Poopbutt, you've been very helpful.
[297:43.17]There you are.
[297:44.96]Looking for me, friend.
[297:46.34]Bearing good tidings, I hope.
[297:48.80]Else here to put me in chains, I'll wager.
[297:52.20]I've had cause to ask the good folk of Grand Sorin about salvation myself.
[297:59.68]I'm gonna choke.
[298:04.35]Seems I'm cursed with a villain's mean door.
[298:07.33]One look at my face, stalls a man's tongue dead.
[298:17.49]What the fuck, man?
[298:18.53]Can you get it out of your system already?
[298:21.67]Had I your gentle manner, I'd have them singing long and loud.
[298:26.31]Seems to me we share a common goal.
[298:29.26]Perhaps you'd take on my investigation.
[298:32.76]Take this with you.
[298:34.74]Renew your inquiry into salvation.
[298:43.09]That token I gave is a countersign.
[298:45.65]It will mark you as friend to agents of salvation.
[298:49.49]May have loosened their tongues as well.
[298:51.92]I hope you'll return to share your findings, good.
[298:55.90]Alright, so now I've got to talk to more people.
[299:10.95]This leads outside though.
[299:12.91]Is it just open?
[299:13.79]Yeah.
[299:14.07]Hold on.
[299:14.45]I don't want to do that yet.
[299:19.09]Up the ladder.
[299:25.68]So now I look like a friend to people that are part of the cult.
[299:30.28]And then once I become very close friends, that's when we do a backstab.
[299:48.52]Uh, first person is here.
[299:53.74]Lady with the pot.
[299:54.40]Throw off building.
[299:56.54]Okay, there's a meeting going on.
[300:16.33]I just broke her base.
[300:17.18]I'm not going to do anything else.
[300:21.32]More info.
[300:21.90]I'm going to stick with the same, the main quest here.
[300:26.86]Oh, they're doing a meeting of the Biaz.
[300:33.75]What am I doing here?
[300:38.38]I guess I do have to go over here.
[300:44.37]Can I make it this way by... Seems the castle walls are reached by a flight of stairs ahead.
[300:54.57]The ones that I just took.
[300:56.61]Thank you for telling me.
[301:00.60]Okay, here we go.
[301:03.74]Ah, say no more, friend.
[301:06.62]I must confess, I'd not expected the arisen to shan salvation's creed.
[301:11.30]Though, truth be told,
[301:13.62]That's all you got.
[301:19.49]No other information, just... Why is there a chipmunk sub sometimes?
[301:30.98]Yeah, I... I mean, it's very...
[301:37.80]The game has a character creator, and you can make them have very, very high to very, very low voice.
[301:44.56]It's probably very off-putting if you're just joining us.
[301:48.42]And trust me, it's off-putting to me.
[301:50.20]And I've been here for five hours playing it.
[301:53.44]The gatherings to take place down in the catacombs are here.
[301:57.16]He sounds upset talking about it.
[301:58.56]You'll not find me there.
[302:00.26]It's far too dangerous a place to brave for a night's diversion.
[302:05.86]By the way, I didn't make this character.
[302:11.26]I did not make Poopbutt or Dude.
[302:16.14]These are characters that were given to me.
[302:22.67]That's not a lie.
[302:23.87]That is for real.
[302:36.48]You didn't have to pick them.
[302:38.32]Oh, yes I did.
[302:41.12]Whoa, don't do that!
[302:44.08]Oh.
[302:46.47]Seeker's token.
[302:49.39]It's not gonna hurt that bad, is it?
[302:53.19]Can I run and jump and grab the ladder?
[302:56.13]No, definitely not.
[303:00.41]That's such a Jerma joke.
[303:01.63]It's not my character though, I swear to God.
[303:10.83]That would hurt a lot.
[303:13.59]Alright, let's go.
[303:19.98]If only you could levitate.
[303:24.50]Where the hell did this put me?
[303:34.59]Why did it bring me out here?
[303:40.38]Uh, do we swim?
[303:41.68]Ah, Master, you're back.
[304:00.79]Must have washed up here.
[304:02.35]Has it still washed by now?
[304:07.36]It must have washed up here.
[304:08.84]How convenient.
[304:10.22]Water too deep or idle too long in the water or you'll fall unconscious.
[304:16.35]So why the hell did it want me to come up this way?
[304:22.55]Oh, what?
[304:26.93]It's all the way over here.
[304:33.72]Walking at the water's edge.
[304:39.04]So I have to go the other way.
[304:48.44]Because it was an exit, it will point you to any exit.
[304:52.02]Okay, so that's not where I need to go, though.
[304:53.52]Like, I gotta go up here.
[304:57.78]Like, up there and out.
[304:59.70]So we need to go out that way.
[305:01.84]Not out here to the ocean.
[305:20.83]Let's go.
[305:32.96]Ride a horse?
[305:37.06]No, don't do that.
[305:40.08]Not the horse part.
[305:40.72]That part.
[305:44.44]Take care you aren't soaking water.
[305:51.82]What?
[305:57.68]I don't even know.
[305:59.13]Half the time, what the fuck they're saying?
[306:00.89]Is there a way to get through here?
[306:14.62]No.
[306:14.82]I'm gonna go up and around.
[306:22.56]Turn on subtitles for them.
[306:26.68]That's not a bad idea.
[306:28.28]But that would be so irritating in its own right.
[306:31.65]Hello, hello.
[306:32.43]Who among you has seen the dragon?
[306:34.97]Who saw it raise a village at the southern shore?
[306:39.53]No doubt you were filled with fear and awe.
[306:42.27]With trepidation.
[306:43.61]With despair.
[306:46.92]Hear ye!
[306:47.48]Hear ye!
[306:48.52]Attention!
[306:50.74]Alright, let's go.
[306:52.40]Finally, get me out of here.
[306:53.60]Alright, we can finally get this going.
[306:55.19]Why would you jump off there?
[306:56.07]Okay.
[306:56.17]We need to go this way.
[306:57.85]On that road, heading that way.
[307:22.07]Alright, open world, let's go.
[307:36.14]We have everybody with us, right?
[307:37.66]Yeah.
[307:42.78]Gonna get ambushed.
[307:53.05]No horses, just sprinting.
[308:02.03]Can somebody help me here?
[308:03.38]CAN SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING?!
[308:09.62]What the fuck?
[308:10.72]I need to heal.
[308:16.26]Help!
[308:16.86]He's coming after me!
[308:25.48]What the fuck is this guy?
[308:26.76]Why is he unkillable?
[308:28.30]Don't let him get me!
[308:30.76]Don't let him get me!
[308:39.50]Oh my god, please!
[308:58.13]Get away from me.
[308:58.75]Get away from me.
[308:59.17]Get away from me.
[308:59.58]Get away from me.
[309:00.02]I'll heal your wounds.
[309:00.98]Wait for an opening.
[309:06.10]Frazzle.
[309:06.66]Frazzle him.
[309:07.08]I've learned a feat.
[309:08.02]They're left exposed after a grand strike.
[309:12.86]Is he dead?
[309:15.40]We have triumphed.
[309:24.45]What the fuck?
[309:26.55]The roads are comparatively
[309:29.68]You say that now.
[309:30.70]Are you sure about that?
[309:42.78]What the hell is this?
[309:44.74]It's a leather circlet.
[309:52.58]What are these?
[309:54.02]Great deal of health and stamina.
[309:57.75]Rotten berries, bit of health.
[309:59.03]Let's give... One... Give this cloth to dude.
[310:10.71]Pork crystal.
[310:11.35]This thing's heavy.
[310:14.46]Give it a Shido.
[310:20.26]Bunch of water.
[310:29.47]Why do I have that so heavy?
[310:36.74]Okay, this is the heaviest shit I have.
[310:42.88]Arrows.
[310:45.06]Well, I don't need these, so... Let's take them.
[311:06.81]It's the rubble that is so heavy.
[311:18.09]Grandsorn rubble.
[311:24.82]Wolf pelts.
[311:25.66]That's heavy.
[311:26.14]I mean, it's already sorted by weight, isn't it?
[311:29.12]I probably should have stored this shit...
[311:35.24]Yeah, poop butt.
[311:36.42]Take like some of this dumb shit.
[311:40.75]He's just carrying around rocks.
[311:44.23]But I don't... I don't know.
[311:45.67]Maybe I need them.
[311:55.72]Okay, I'm alright.
[312:01.40]Maybe the wolf pelts.
[312:03.12]Give it to poop butt.
[312:11.26]Throw away the rotten food?
[312:12.52]Okay.
[312:32.22]Alright, let's go.
[312:39.52]This is painful to watch when you finish the game four times.
[312:43.81]Well, uh, you have finished the game four times.
[312:48.61]This is the first time I've ever opened it.
[312:51.37]I need a heal.
[312:53.71]Poupon is such a casual word now.
[313:01.64]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[313:13.47]Great deal of health and stamina.
[313:16.36]Just eat the nuts.
[313:26.57]Should I get meat from these guys or something?
[313:34.13]Let's get some food.
[313:41.80]Nice dive.
[313:47.35]There's meat?
[313:48.09]Okay, good.
[313:51.07]Let's get some meat.
[314:03.67]Holy boon, can I do it to myself?
[314:05.74]What's that?
[314:11.77]How do I do it to myself?
[314:21.96]Click on the stick to do it to yourself.
[314:23.18]So I can charge this twice.
[314:25.36]Okay.
[314:25.60]One, two, three.
[314:26.48]I see.
[314:26.92]I get it.
[314:44.95]Beast stake, fair bit of stamina.
[314:48.43]Stamina.
[314:49.87]Health and stamina.
[314:59.89]One, two, okay.
[315:02.91]Get him!
[315:06.81]That works!
[315:11.59]What's that?
[315:18.83]Are you guys gonna pick up the meat?
[315:30.72]He's power leveling.
[315:37.99]Killing boars in Warcraft.
[315:40.37]Alright, there's a bad guy over there, I think.
[315:41.69]Alright, no more fucking around.
[315:44.38]Kill a couple more cows and let's go.
[315:58.97]Alright, that's it.
[316:08.01]Rusted daggers?
[316:10.07]Didn't somebody say that the daggers can actually be used, like the rusty shit can be upgraded and actually works pretty well?
[316:38.60]It seems- I'm not jumping in there, I fucking destroyed myself last time.
[316:44.16]We're going the right way.
[316:52.15]Rusty weapons are extremely overpowered when they're upgraded fully.
[316:55.04]That's kind of cool.
[316:57.20]So there's a reason to use them.
[316:59.50]There's a chest right here.
[317:02.62]Throw somebody in to test it.
[317:08.18]So much money.
[317:08.78]Oh, here's the entrance.
[317:18.75]Wolves hunting packs!
[317:21.34]I was trying to shoot this guy.
[317:23.72]That's good to know.
[317:25.04]Thanks for the tip.
[317:27.12]You look like you're LARPing.
[317:28.26]I mean, part of me is LARPing.
[317:54.24]Oh, what are those lizard men?
[317:55.65]Electricity?
[317:59.87]Pretty good.
[318:26.65]The lizard wizard?
[318:27.47]Not quite.
[318:32.73]Alright, we're almost at the sewer portion.
[318:37.05]Oh!
[318:37.63]I didn't even know that's, I thought that was a rock.
[318:39.20]His head is mine!
[318:49.74]I want to see what it did.
[318:52.12]Good target.
[318:52.64]Alright, so... how are we doing?
[318:54.54]So where is this entrance?
[319:18.80]I'm not even in the right spot.
[319:20.28]Get out of here.
[319:21.67]Out.
[319:31.15]Will my grandkids be able to see this on second Jerma?
[319:34.40]Maybe.
[319:35.22]It's very possible.
[319:40.84]If YouTube is still available in like another 30 or 40 years, you might see it.
[319:50.28]Alright, slow down.
[319:51.60]Oh.
[319:52.72]Wolves are... Come on, help.
[319:55.63]Where are you two?
[319:56.33]Oh, fuck.
[319:56.69]I'm tired.
[320:15.02]Am I gonna name my firstborn Shito?
[320:18.69]I don't think so.
[320:22.67]My firstborn's gonna be Dave.
[320:23.95]David.
[320:44.63]Including the stutter that I just heard.
[320:49.53]What?
[320:51.47]What are you looking at?
[320:56.77]Oh, I'm gonna do that too.
[321:03.00]Whoops.
[321:05.40]Did I just fucking burn somebody's tent?
[321:09.26]Why are the wolves in a camp?
[321:12.91]Ugh, that guy's still burning.
[321:14.93]Oh, let's go look at-
[321:31.94]Where else do you think wolves live?
[321:36.76]In a tent?
[321:38.32]They don't put up tents?
[321:39.64]Dude does not talk that often, I've noticed that.
[321:43.68]And when he does, it seems very strange.
[322:04.25]He's so out of place.
[322:05.17]Instead of sleeping?
[322:11.81]Mushrooms?
[322:18.99]Level 15.
[322:19.76]They grow up so fast.
[322:23.82]Is there a reliable place I can kind of cross this river?
[322:30.04]Just gonna have to cross it.
[322:30.90]It's right there.
[322:33.02]Uh, is that actually safe?
[322:36.49]It's so far to run.
[322:37.25]That's a good point.
[322:39.09]Alright.
[322:39.39]Here we are.
[323:03.56]Two?
[323:05.14]Fire into the water.
[323:10.85]That's not gonna go very well, is it?
[323:30.13]Lightning into the water.
[323:30.97]Oh fuck, I haven't saved it in a long time.
[323:46.86]Get out of the water.
[323:51.12]Get out of the water, guys.

[325:17.05]I don't even know where the last time I saved it was.
[325:38.35]Oh, this is fucking fantastic.
[325:39.67]So that was an unwinnable fight.
[325:51.54]I had to just run.

[326:13.39]Level 14, level 9, level 10.
[326:15.19]Is it time to just throw these guys in the river?
[326:33.00]It was time a long time ago.
[326:36.28]Uh...
[326:38.44]Damn it.

[335:47.76]Time to go get some heals.
[336:14.83]Let's go get some healing potions.
[336:16.40]I need way more than this.
[336:48.89]Don't let the party distract you from this compact stream.
[336:52.09]How am I enjoying the game so far?
[337:00.16]I think it's great.
[337:05.32]It's just weird enough.
[337:08.18]And has enough interesting things going on that I think it's... I like it a lot.
[337:12.00]It's fun.
[337:18.77]But apparently I'm having trouble traversing the game.
[337:23.59]Because I need to go in here.
[337:26.27]And I didn't go the right way.
[337:29.62]Save at the inn?
[337:35.12]Yeah, I'll rest at the inn.

[338:15.23]So I can just use that?
[338:16.01]Alright, okay, okay, okay.

[340:11.35]What will it be today?
[340:12.87]Did I actually need that item, somebody says?
[340:21.14]Where the hell is it?
[340:33.03]Oh, it's the text deciphering thing.
[340:34.51]Alright, this thing is staying in here.
[340:36.33]And then I'm gonna get healing items.
[340:54.03]Who the hell is this?
[341:05.99]Why are they dressed like this?
[341:09.64]Player name Rift Crystals Didn't I already do this?
[341:20.98]What?
[341:30.90]Why can't they dress my character up?
[341:43.83]What?
[341:59.40]Yes, I don't want this.
[342:00.77]I brought this back for you.
[342:19.78]I've learned new techniques against that phone.
[343:24.23]Where is it?
[343:24.69]What the fuck did you get there?
[343:35.98]It's in the storage?
[343:36.84]Alright, let's go.
[343:47.27]I'm so confused.
[343:48.17]What will it be today?
[344:05.33]An almighty divine blade received along with your returned heart.
[344:15.00]How do I throw this away?
[344:22.66]What if I give this to Poop Master and then throw him off a bridge?
[344:41.59]Only I can use it.
[344:45.85]No, I'm not even gonna pick it.
[344:48.56]I don't even... I'm not gonna touch it.
[344:52.88]Mm-mm.
[344:53.62]No.
[344:54.22]I'm not even gonna open it.
[344:56.72]No, thanks.
[345:00.52]I'm just gonna keep it in the box.
[345:03.64]Okay, let's go.
[345:05.12]I just need to buy some healing items.
[345:13.82]Alright, so this is a bit of health, a fair amount of health.
[345:39.75]Cover stamina.
[345:56.51]The Jester outfit was funny.
[345:58.09]I don't like how they can dress up my own character.
[346:03.25]Purge the body of poisons.
[346:05.57]Drive off the urge to slay.
[346:06.46]I'm just going to get a bunch of these.
[346:08.76]Just to bring one speed.

[346:51.21]He said at the very beginning of the game he knew he was going to have to get his heart back.
[346:57.04]I mean, yeah, but... I didn't... I didn't really want to get the last item in the game.
[347:04.78]Nobody said you have the wrong thing to say, but let me take a look.

[352:58.51]Okay.
[352:58.79]Shido needs... They all need it.
[353:05.12]This really is just Kenshi on the ground.
[353:30.05]Didn't I buy a shitload of these?
[353:31.45]I did.
[353:52.18]A curative will serve.
[353:54.15]This will restore a bit of health.
[354:08.00]Alright.
[354:10.48]Well, that was fun.
[354:18.84]What's that?
[354:19.66]What's this?
[354:21.88]Keep picking up rocks.
[354:22.76]Monsters can strike day or night, even in the shadow of Grand Sorin's walls.
[354:34.65]So I need to go down this road.
[354:43.79]That was so funny.
[354:44.69]He was actually just jumping around.
[354:45.99]What are you all saying?
[355:12.28]Give me one of those stamina things.
[355:26.37]I need to get the meat from the cows again.
[355:28.01]Alright.
[355:32.86]So now... I should be able to... walk down this road.
[355:44.21]Who's this guy?
[355:49.14]Can you guys use your health things?
[355:50.72]You're making me nervous.
[355:51.60]They're not gonna use them, are they?
[356:12.32]What's with the voice changer for the characters?
[356:15.86]They use them when they need to.
[356:18.18]Okay.
[356:20.01]The voice changer is just their voice.
[356:24.93]There's a character creator that... ...weighs a fair amount of stamina.
[356:40.28]Switch to their inventories, okay.
[356:44.33]Hand over anything of worth you've got.
[356:46.47]Where?
[356:48.73]Oh, not this shit again.
[356:52.15]Guys, guys, pay attention.
[356:53.99]Guys!

[356:56.75]Fuck.
[357:30.09]Nice.
[357:32.07]No, we did.
[357:37.55]You guys are strong.
[357:44.91]Check the map.
[357:45.56]Make sure we're going the right way.
[357:46.60]I am.
[357:47.02]Okay, just stay on this road to the left.
[357:56.34]How we doing?
[357:56.78]Everybody good?
[358:04.76]Alright, so let me see, hold on, I... Holy Boon, right?
[358:08.86]So I have Holy Boon selected.
[358:10.84]Press the stick in, and that does it to me.
[358:14.34]Which then gives me Holy Bolts.
[358:17.06]Alright.
[358:27.19]Where?
[358:28.43]Is that a bandit or a... no.
[358:35.41]Are these bandits?
[358:38.37]They just look like regular people.
[358:40.47]You've my support.
[358:42.03]Are they?
[358:42.39]They attack in quick succession.
[358:45.83]They're left exposed after a grand strike.
[358:49.34]I guess so.
[358:50.44]Are they homing?
[358:55.00]That's kind of cool.
[358:59.48]Counter-activate strike.
[359:05.81]Come on.
[359:06.53]That's it?
[359:06.95]Nope.
[359:09.81]Well, there's archers over here.
[359:14.15]What's the water pipe thing called?
[359:17.35]What do you mean the water pipe thing?
[359:44.75]We're not getting that much experience.
[359:47.39]If you don't hydrate, you're gonna miss your pee.
[359:53.35]I got a water right here, I'm good.
[360:01.77]Thanks for the reminder.
[360:13.30]Alright, I'm almost at the spot.
[360:14.46]Let's save it.
[360:19.96]Shido is yellow.
[360:25.31]Well, Shido is not a human.
[360:37.57]Is this a bad guy?
[360:42.77]I- okay.
[360:43.73]Oh, fuck.
[360:44.13]Nice.
[360:46.13]I did it.
[361:07.33]Oh, no.
[361:07.75]Okay, I need to ice people.
[361:10.39]Okay, everyone's ice enchanted.
[361:43.46]Those scales and spears I don't know if I'm going to be wearing.
[361:46.48]I don't know which way to fight them.
[361:48.26]Fire and ice.
[361:51.14]The scales were calling a steal.
[361:55.51]They have their tails I'll weave as well.
[362:01.17]Watch these.
[362:03.85]These are weaves of fire, okay.
[362:11.19]Oh, no.
[362:12.09]Oh, this is different.
[362:13.07]Those are the guys by the river.
[362:14.21]Good to know.
[362:14.77]I didn't get back on a road.
[362:16.29]Come, come, come, come, come, come.
[362:17.56]Let's go.
[362:18.34]Road is up here.
[362:19.08]Very well.
[362:40.25]I still hear music though.
[362:43.17]Before setting off, we ought to equip ourselves to suit our objectives.
[362:47.38]Can I get a heal?
[362:49.08]I shall restore your health.
[362:50.62]Hold on.
[362:53.22]Thank you.
[363:04.11]The path diverges.
[363:09.77]Did I cut it too quickly?
[363:10.71]I think I might have.
[363:12.55]I think I gotta be up there.
[363:18.88]There.
[363:20.58]I cut it too quickly.
[363:21.72]Gotta go around.
[363:28.55]Let us check on that.
[363:36.93]Maybe not.
[363:44.43]A character server is still working for the game, yeah.
[363:48.22]Seems like it, at least.
[363:54.59]Oh, ah ah ah ah ah ah.
[364:04.10]Alright, going.
[364:05.34]That was kind of cool.
[364:08.66]Bigger goblin.
[364:49.81]There it is.
[364:50.25]There's the line.
[364:51.83]He said the line.
[364:55.01]Everyone was waiting for that.
[365:10.34]I really should try to play this game again.
[365:11.56]It's quite good.
[365:14.13]Yeah, it's just kind of fun to play.
[365:16.43]I mean, the first two or three hours of this stream, we went over kind of the jokey shit that's in the game.
[365:23.27]But, as just a video game, it's actually very fun.
[365:27.95]It's a straight-up video game.
[365:36.65]I don't think that's safe.
[365:58.00]Very well.
[365:59.88]I'm on my way.
[366:02.00]There's like a stone over here.
[366:03.18]This leads down into the catacombs.
[366:07.86]Maybe time.
[366:09.80]Should I change people?
[366:14.61]I'll take that.
[366:16.23]What level are these people?
[366:17.11]15, 14.
[366:17.15]No, good.
[366:25.94]That's just in case you want to change out a party member or something.
[366:28.84]Alright.
[366:30.62]Save it.
[366:32.90]Let's go pay the cult a visit.
[366:44.11]Easy.
[366:44.25]Put down the crystal here.
[366:46.23]Hmm.
[366:47.45]What's that?
[366:58.00]Do I only get to place that one time?
[367:02.70]I'll take that.
[367:03.22]I need a, uh, lantern.
[367:10.19]It is too dark to navigate without a torch.
[367:15.39]I'll well search the area.
[367:17.23]The crypt was fashioned ages ago, before the fate came to Gransys.
[367:23.56]Oh, rats!
[367:26.93]light cure this looks interesting small coins you need to open this gate to use the lift long ago when the people worship the old gods the gods of nature we cannot pass through I suspect it's why they return their dead to the soil to the Earth god what's this
[367:53.17]that their souls might be cleansed and born anew in the coming generations.
[367:55.91]They never stop talking.
[367:59.41]It's very, very funny.
[368:00.37]They don't ever stop speaking.
[368:02.17]I'll take that.
[368:08.10]We can't go that way.
[368:09.06]Go the other way.
[368:11.16]Go this way.
[368:12.74]That's interesting.
[368:13.28]This place crawls with the undead.
[368:17.28]I've learned of this area.
[368:18.78]What's this?
[368:21.74]Yes, you have.
[368:22.34]Funny joke voice!
[368:23.24]You heard it!
[368:26.44]Well, fire is really good here.
[368:55.19]It would be awkward if nobody talked in a party of four people.
[369:00.35]Yeah, it would.
[369:02.52]Alright.
[369:03.16]That's good to know.
[369:23.72]Nobody trapped in there?
[369:26.55]There's just a person here.
[369:38.61]We all have a curse now.
[369:41.68]Maybe I shouldn't have jumped inside of the casket the second you fucking opened it.
[369:49.20]We're opening up all these fucked up sarcophagus I'm gonna stand in them
[370:16.63]Just poop master things.
[370:19.91]Nice move.
[370:20.97]That was a knee right to the face.
[370:22.43]A lot of these fragments are dropping.
[370:24.69]They're pretty good.
[370:47.41]They hate fire.
[370:48.53]They'll mold this.
[370:49.75]It does not seem fair.
[370:52.03]I'm going to go with Boomer.
[370:56.61]Back up.
[370:57.05]I'm on my way.
[370:57.83]It was nothing.
[370:59.69]It was a troubling foe.
[371:00.45]Yeah, it was really embarrassing.
[371:02.96]Strength in numbers arisen.
[371:04.40]If you feel a foe is beyond our means, there's no shame in fleeing.
[371:09.34]Oh, you're right, Lester.
[371:11.22]Whack-a-mole.
[371:11.82]You ain't even going to get up.
[371:14.40]Lighting these lamps could be...
[371:20.05]Whoops!
[371:21.73]Level 16, nice.
[371:22.13]Very cool.
[371:22.43]I'm... I'm dead?
[371:22.75]Oh, and he said undead.
[371:50.49]What is it showing me here?
[371:53.19]Area?
[371:53.87]Oh, no.
[371:54.45]Nothing.
[371:54.89]Okay.
[371:56.31]So I'm about to wrap around.
[371:57.51]There is the lever back here.
[371:59.51]I'm gonna assume I have to go down a little bit further.
[372:04.17]Or... Yeah.
[372:08.22]Hey, look.
[372:08.54]Another lever.
[372:09.46]Okay.
[372:25.71]No, I'm dead.
[372:28.03]No, I am.
[372:30.94]Chest.
[372:31.24]The game really is so cool.
[372:32.40]The fact that these are all people that I didn't make is really, really funny.
[372:38.96]Really interesting.
[372:54.15]Are you guys gonna do anything?
[372:55.11]Do they do anything?
[373:02.34]They don't attack.
[373:04.46]I think we're good.
[373:10.50]Coin's good.
[373:22.52]Now we got a crossroads up here.
[373:23.64]Locked.
[373:24.12]Those fireballs are such overkill.
[373:26.56]Oh, I'm sure they are.
[373:50.47]Fire's the best.
[373:55.71]Oh, I get it.
[373:56.83]The stench!
[374:16.63]Okay, I gotta wait till they get to possess somebody, which is good.
[374:21.07]There we go.
[374:21.77]Alright, so they have to possess somebody.
[374:27.99]Dude, I am just so relaxed right now.
[374:35.81]I don't know, it's just relaxing.
[374:48.94]Use the holy boon?
[374:49.74]That's a good idea.
[374:52.80]Give it to you.
[374:54.68]Snooze day?
[374:54.98]Yeah, sometimes you have snooze day.
[374:56.46]I've been playing a bunch of intense games lately.
[375:20.34]Sometimes it's nice just to open my mouth and play a game.
[375:27.27]Where's the lever?
[375:34.99]Like Animal Crossing?
[375:43.29]Oh, you're right, Master.
[375:46.27]Nice to relax and fucking murder my pawns to make room for new ones.
[375:59.66]You missed a new leaf?
[376:00.62]Isn't there a new one coming out?
[376:02.32]There's a new Animal Crossing coming out for the Switch.
[376:04.78]This year, right?
[376:12.24]Sometime in 2019.
[376:12.82]Uh, let me see.
[376:13.22]That doesn't matter.
[376:19.84]Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
[376:26.84]Alright, holy boon, let's give to... you.
[376:34.87]I'm feeling a ghost coming.
[376:42.39]This isn't Dragon Quest?
[376:44.60]No, it's... Big Dragon Quest.
[376:48.60]That really is a dogshit title, isn't it?
[376:56.98]Oh, I didn't know what to title it.
[376:58.64]I could've titled it like... Welcome to the Freak Show or something.
[377:19.15]Change title.
[377:20.01]No, it's too late.
[377:21.61]The screen's been going for over six, almost six and a half hours.
[377:24.55]Can't change the title now.
[377:27.17]Hello?
[377:33.01]Thanks for throwing that in the back of my head.
[377:39.93]Alright, alright, alright, easy.
[377:42.76]Okay, alright, we got a problem here.
[377:51.90]Holy.
[377:52.95]Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[377:56.41]This skeleton has to work.
[378:09.63]Okay, everybody good?
[378:15.57]Pick up all the shit that we need.
[378:20.83]Dark.
[378:20.95]Peridot.
[378:22.89]We can climb down here.
[378:38.21]I ain't going down there without a save, no way.
[378:39.71]That's it.
[378:48.05]That was just South Park character.
[379:05.72]Let's go this way, I guess.
[379:11.01]This wraps back around, doesn't it?
[379:14.63]Whoa.
[379:16.53]Anyone else over here?
[379:21.44]Holy shit.
[379:21.74]No.
[379:21.84]I'm dead.
[379:46.64]That wizard.
[379:50.94]Yeah, the fucking mage.
[379:54.56]The mage charges in first.
[379:59.62]That's alright.
[380:00.88]I guess I have to go that way.
[380:06.68]No!
[380:08.44]Gave everybody holy boon.
[380:10.58]Let's go.
[380:16.89]Yeah, I shouldn't be sprinting around corners It really should be I
[380:54.73]Alright, go.
[381:00.33]What's on the... Okay, I thought that was... He was wearing something on his back.
[381:04.23]He is, but... You know, never mind.
[381:07.93]Hmm.
[381:09.53]Frame plate.
[381:11.51]Is this open?
[381:12.51]No.
[381:21.72]So now we're here.
[381:24.50]Alright, go.
[381:26.56]On my way.
[381:28.14]A walking dead bear.
[381:30.20]You can see they hardly falter, and there are soldiers.
[381:33.81]Why did you just rip all the way around?
[381:37.07]That was effective.
[381:38.95]We have triumphed.
[381:46.27]Everybody beefed up.
[381:48.18]Let's go.
[381:48.42]Oh, man.
[381:48.70]I... I got so tired.
[381:49.24]I went into relaxation mode.
[381:50.28]You know when that happened?
[381:52.18]It was after the big snake Hydra fight thing.
[381:56.00]Oh, fuck.
[381:56.20]Oh, no.
[382:15.55]Holy... What should we use against Troll?
[382:18.53]Fire?
[382:18.91]Ice?
[382:20.07]Lightning?
[382:45.93]They're fast for all that metal.
[382:47.21]Is there a poop master that's having trouble?
[382:49.49]He's massive.
[382:52.75]Come on, Latitude.
[382:54.99]Go in.
[382:55.51]Keep your distance.
[382:56.17]That works.
[382:56.63]What do you propose?
[382:58.87]Latitude works pretty well.
[383:00.19]Be careful of this.
[383:15.85]Latitude works.
[383:16.62]Oh, I freeze it.
[383:17.86]Hit him in the head.
[383:19.40]Right in his head.
[383:27.84]Trolls are weak to mods.
[383:30.47]Oh, I see.
[383:31.17]I hate the feasts.
[383:45.45]Alright, right in the head.
[383:54.48]Freeze him, freeze him, freeze him.
[383:59.50]What's going on?
[384:00.26]Where's my hudge?
[384:01.02]Watch out!
[384:15.95]I feel like I'm playing World of Warcraft.
[384:19.43]Oh shit, I'm tired.
[384:42.78]Holy shit, he just dropkicked me.
[384:44.08]I just took a picture of him dropkicking me in the fucking face.
[384:46.68]Shito!
[384:52.61]Somebody save Shito!
[384:56.84]I'll do it.
[384:57.70]Yeah, the fucking mage will do it.
[385:10.13]Oh, thank god he's frozen!
[385:11.29]Excuse me, goodbye.
[385:12.01]Get him!
[385:12.27]We did it.
[385:38.10]That's it?
[385:38.46]Who else is down here?
[385:40.84]Whoa, easy.
[385:41.38]Don't just run forward.
[385:42.54]We just took on the Abominable Snowman.
[385:49.45]You just killed Bigfoot and you want to run and sprint and kill everything right now and attack stuff?
[385:58.95]Can't save it here.
[386:03.31]Now we can go.
[386:08.63]Ooh.
[386:15.48]Iron Greaves?
[386:18.92]There's more shit over here.
[386:21.20]Liquid Vim.
[386:23.68]And milk.
[386:25.02]I think we're getting close.
[386:46.30]Somebody made a Linux joke?
[386:50.48]What's the Linux reference?
[387:01.15]Don't fall down.
[387:03.46]What's that?
[387:14.61]The joke is Linux.
[387:15.69]Oh, I see.
[387:19.53]Linux.
[387:21.65]I also missed some community subs from Big Marsh.
[387:26.08]I'm not sure when I must have been not paying attention.
[387:27.92]I must have been focusing on something or I might not have been here, but... Thank you, Big Marsh, if you're still here.
[387:32.30]For a shitload of community subs.
[387:35.27]Thank you.
[387:43.70]You guys not gonna pick all this up?
[387:51.40]You named it Poop Master.
[387:52.96]I did not.
[387:53.84]I didn't name this.
[387:56.35]I know people are gonna- are coming to the stream and they're thinking that I did that.
[387:59.05]I swear to- I'm gonna get rid of him.
[388:01.87]That character has to get thrown in the trash.
[388:03.71]Because people are gonna come and think that I actually made that character.
[388:09.49]I didn't make any of these people.
[388:10.69]I made Shito.
[388:11.55]That's the only one.
[388:19.18]Haha, you named him food master.
[388:20.94]Oh my god, I know.
[388:23.34]I didn't though.
[388:26.91]I had to use... Had to use... Two ways to go.
[388:40.00]Where's the map?
[388:44.56]This is the way to go.
[388:45.52]But let me just see what's down here first.
[388:50.33]Probably an exit.
[388:52.94]Shortcut something way back up.
[388:59.40]Maybe?
[388:59.66]Uh-huh.
[389:03.74]There is the shortcut.
[389:05.87]Perfect.
[389:26.23]Didn't want to make YouTuber jokes, but chose Poop Master.
[389:32.01]Yeah, but wasn't that more chats doing than it was mine?
[389:38.82]And I've got to be fair to myself a little bit here.
[389:43.26]There's pretty much like a 30% chance that the character's name is going to be named like Poopoo Dickhead or something.
[389:50.19]We've seen at least three or four of them.
[389:56.27]Oh, this is the meeting.
[390:23.01]Occult meeting.
[390:23.75]We're about to break it up.
[390:25.29]Is this on PC?
[390:28.25]It is on PC.
[390:28.85]We didn't get the graphic mods?
[390:35.54]Do I... Should I have a graphic... Should I open the front door?
[391:02.52]What are they?
[391:03.08]This world, which writhes and struggles against its fears, bludgeoned by its own heedlessness...
[391:28.63]I'm on my way.
[391:28.95]Don't, don't, don't blow cover here.
[391:31.21]Don't, stay with me.
[391:32.17]Very well.
[391:41.24]Best we brought cures for various ailments.
[391:43.94]They may save our lives.
[391:46.50]Okay.
[391:59.74]It's terrifying.
[392:04.70]I'll go at once.
[392:06.40]I'm on my way.
[392:07.74]Very well.
[392:09.32]And we are duty-bound to cede our souls unto it.
[392:14.35]Take care not to step on any stray bones.
[392:18.53]These are dark times.
[392:29.86]What?
[392:30.28]I didn't do anything.
[392:37.60]No, I wanted to watch that.
[392:38.62]What did I do wrong?
[392:39.46]Here comes the boss.
[392:41.38]He's going to sacrifice everybody in there, and they're going to turn into a giant monster.
[393:10.54]Don't look behind you, don't look behind you!
[393:18.87]No... We never see the full frontal face.
[393:39.65]Okay.
[393:40.27]Defeat the undead.
[393:42.33]Oh, really?
[393:47.13]I was about to tap.
[393:48.73]Help me, Poop Master.
[393:51.06]The guy that I didn't make.
[393:53.80]Every time I say his name, I have to assume maybe one or two people came to the stream.
[393:56.68]Remember, I didn't make that character.
[393:58.58]I'll take that.
[394:15.44]We obviously haven't, so keep at it.
[394:21.80]Hey, I just joined the stream.
[394:30.83]Did he make Poop Master?
[394:33.53]No.
[394:34.79]I suppose it's the stuff of every day to you, isn't it?
[394:39.51]I'd thank you to join me for a moment.
[394:44.87]We have triumphed.
[394:46.41]Strength in numbers arisen.
[394:51.87]What's that?
[394:54.47]Any time.
[394:57.91]Why didn't you make poop faster?
[395:02.81]Somebody didn't even realize.
[395:06.43]Listen.
[395:08.63]The person that made Poop Master didn't know that his character was going to be able to be seen or used anywhere.
[395:14.18]That was a dumb, just easy, shitty name to make your character.
[395:20.07]He has no idea that it's being used online.
[395:32.69]How many times have you guys made a character name and it was, like, dog shit?
[395:36.33]Because, you know, if you're playing a game, you don't have to worry about it.
[395:39.60]Never.
[395:59.95]No, 5-2 by the way, right guys?
[396:01.35]Nope.
[396:01.59]More like 6-1 or like 5-11.
[396:28.64]I feel more familiar with this quest, sir.
[396:31.39]I've gained much knowledge.
[396:35.45]But I... I see you're a reasonable sort.
[396:38.81]The sort like to hear reason.
[396:41.27]I... Get off of him.
[396:42.87]Come, sir.
[396:43.65]What's to be gained from glutting in your hands?
[396:46.01]It's your choice to make, Orison.
[396:47.33]I'm on my way.
[396:49.03]As naught can stay the dragon's fire.
[396:51.84]What say we await perdition together?
[396:55.67]There's many a pleasure to indulge in ere salvation comes.
[396:59.52]I will gladly furnish the coin.
[397:02.14]Pray spare me, Arisen, that I may live to see the flame.
[397:06.98]You'll be well rewarded.
[397:09.86]Don't be a fool, sir.
[397:11.28]Surely my gold is worth more to you than my head.
[397:30.59]My, my.
[397:32.11]Didn't know if you'd have the stomach to do for an unarmed man.
[397:35.90]I forced him.
[397:37.62]I suppose I was wrong to doubt it.
[397:40.08]That kills people.
[397:41.00]Glad to know you're someone I can trust in times to come.
[397:45.24]And come, they shall.
[397:46.42]I didn't know you could die from an Irizuka.
[397:52.02]We'll bring this skulk of foxes to bear, you and I.
[397:58.39]Oh, maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[398:02.77]I shouldn't have thrown a firecracker in the air.
[398:04.61]It's okay.
[398:05.37]He was a bad guy.
[398:05.89]Hey, thanks.
[398:07.04]Cheeto is getting jaded.
[398:14.98]Uh-oh.
[398:31.10]Uh-oh.
[398:38.01]You gotta let the leader open that.
[398:39.31]Don't you see Master Looter is on?
[398:41.87]Alright.
[398:43.25]Now you fucked it all up.
[398:51.42]The guild leader loots the bodies, and then we roll, and then it goes out to who wins.
[399:03.19]Well, the new mission is over, so that means we can sacrifice one of these guys.
[399:13.65]Probably Poop Master.
[399:19.96]Can we just throw Molotov?
[399:35.12]Well.
[399:38.40]Favorite flower.
[399:41.58]Alright, we need to go back this way.
[399:55.35]Well, I guess we're just to go here.
[399:59.25]Get rid of this other one.
[400:02.75]Get up.
[400:07.28]What happened to Hamburger Feet?
[400:08.60]Well, we went through a lot of people, actually.
[400:12.86]Oh.
[400:13.82]There's been at least five or six new recruits.
[400:20.76]Whoops.
[400:25.21]That's a new staff.
[400:28.69]What's going on up here?
[400:29.45]Is this... oil?
[400:36.32]That guy's got destroyed absolutely wrecked no attack You just misclicked What's that
[401:07.67]Bye.
[401:07.83]Alright, Poop Master, thanks for playing.
[401:11.73]Give me the shit that you have on you.
[401:16.25]Give it here.
[401:41.02]What is Shito?
[401:49.11]What is all this?
[401:52.51]Oh, I can't take this away from him.
[401:56.35]I can take this.
[402:05.41]No, I can't.
[402:13.50]Swordsman's ring?
[402:19.20]That's the least of his problems.
[402:52.79]Well, I guess he's staying for a minute.
[402:56.99]Just land on your neck from like a 75 foot drop, 100 foot drop.
[403:05.02]You just got a little wet.
[403:06.18]You alright?
[403:06.96]Be careful.
[403:08.72]Careful, you're wet.
[403:09.58]Oh my goodness.
[403:15.43]This game is so fucking funny.
[403:20.03]But just like a remarkably stupid game.
[403:23.01]But, but, hold on, hear me out.
[403:28.62]The game is great.
[403:36.46]I don't mean that in a negative way at all.
[403:41.28]There's new spells and shit.
[403:42.40]Yeah, that's true.
[403:46.40]There's certainly no worry of ambush out here.
[403:55.43]Alright, I need to go back this way.
[404:02.60]Climb on a buffalo.
[404:03.84]Okay, I'll try it.
[404:17.02]And what's this?
[404:18.93]Oh my goodness!
[404:20.31]Don't kill it!
[404:21.05]Why are you killing this?
[404:23.76]There's no reason to do what you're doing right now.
[404:43.81]What are you doing here?
[404:45.53]Why would you come over here?
[404:46.77]There's no reason for you to attack us right now.
[404:48.99]There's no reason.
[404:51.21]Is he gone?
[405:00.12]Hold on, I wanna do this.
[405:13.61]Can I go?
[405:14.13]Can I bring this into the city?
[405:19.52]Where's the... How close are we?
[405:22.02]Now, if you don't attack, help, help.
[405:25.42]No, no, no, no.
[405:27.01]Help as in... Is there like an everybody just calm the fuck down passive?
[405:38.87]What the fuck was that?
[405:47.42]This way.
[405:48.08]Towards the city.
[405:51.16]Come on.
[405:52.38]You just get out of the fucking way.
[405:53.87]Shido, that's like the second time you've done that.
[405:59.27]No, no, stop, stop.
[406:00.57]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do that.
[406:03.17]You need to get out of the way, though.
[406:04.43]Alright, that's it.
[406:05.63]I'm done.
[406:06.43]Get me the fuck into town.
[406:12.45]Their brains are so small.
[406:17.59]Take him into the ocean.
[406:19.42]I mean, it's a possibility, but you can't steer them.
[406:29.62]I would love to ride him into the city.
[406:30.92]Can I climb this?
[406:37.92]I can't be like a cat?
[406:44.28]Holes like this one are crucial in warding the capital from monsters.
[406:54.69]Kill them all.
[406:58.13]No, no, just follow me.
[406:59.20]Follow me.
[407:01.76]Back in the goddamn town.
[407:04.84]I have to go that way.
[407:07.82]I guess I gotta go straight.
[407:10.22]No, no, fuck it.
[407:10.92]Let's kill him.
[407:13.46]Let's do it.
[407:28.67]Ain't nothin'.
[407:31.09]Just two archers, they're easy.
[407:33.46]Nothin'.
[407:34.08]Nice work.
[407:35.58]Alright, let's get outta here.
[407:36.74]Straight on the road, and then take a right.
[408:09.20]He's playing a mage?
[408:10.40]Yeah.
[408:12.18]It seems like fun.
[408:17.10]Even the capital is not without its dangers, lest we remain cautious arisen.
[408:23.42]Why are you not using auto-travel?
[408:25.74]Be ready for anything.
[408:26.76]You madman, grab the eternal fairy stone from your storage.
[408:32.37]Auto-travel?
[408:35.21]Grand Soren.
[408:36.69]The beating heart of all Gransis.
[408:43.58]Alright, so what do we need to do in here?
[408:45.04]We need to go this way.
[408:46.02]Noble quarter completed.
[408:46.66]He doesn't know.
[408:47.18]Don't break his gamer immersion.
[409:16.55]Can't climb this.
[409:17.05]I think I have to go all the way around.
[409:26.56]Get a new skill or two?
[409:27.36]Yeah, I think what we'll probably do is... I'm probably going to call it up here.
[409:30.98]It's been just about seven hours.
[409:36.00]After the bit, it's probably about eight hours.
[409:37.38]No, I'm going to go through here.
[409:46.27]End of the stream voice?
[409:47.43]Yeah!
[409:52.13]There's so much shit to do.
[409:57.71]Think you play more of this game?
[410:03.27]I think so.
[410:04.75]I think so.
[410:11.81]I did the cult.
[410:13.09]Then the gatherings of salvation did have sinister purpose.
[410:17.06]That's a lot of experience.
[410:18.12]Cool, level 19.
[410:18.78]Alright, so here is the deal.
[410:44.99]Over the next few days, I got a lot of shit.
[410:50.49]So, there's a bunch of stuff that I'm gonna have.
[410:53.31]There's Dreamcast.
[410:56.89]There's some PlayStation 2 stuff that I wanted to do.
[410:59.54]There's the Dark Souls 3 first-person mod.
[411:04.94]There's so much stuff that I want to do.
[411:06.28]$170 of Amazon purchases.
[411:18.41]But I have a lot of things to stream.
[411:20.97]So expect to see this game again in the next few days.
[411:26.02]But we might change gears tomorrow depending on what I have.
[411:31.46]Because a lot of stuff is ordered and it's shipping.
[411:34.70]So depending on what I end up with tomorrow, we might change gears a little.
[411:44.93]But definitely expect this game within the next couple of days.
[411:51.08]And then of course the January 23rd stream is just going to be IRL.
[411:55.84]I'm not going to play a game.
[411:58.52]So let me take a look actually.
[412:00.42]Let me see a... like a calendar.
[412:07.26]Why am I going to stop streaming like tonight?
[412:08.84]I don't know, I'm just... Because it's probably going to be about an 8 hour stream and... I can always feel my energy levels dropping.
[412:19.20]And getting a little tired, getting hungry.
[412:29.19]When it's less viewers than Kenshi, you know it's not good.
[412:33.03]That's alright, though.
[412:34.45]That doesn't bother me.
[412:45.40]It's also very late.
[412:49.18]There were a lot of people here earlier.
[412:51.71]It was like almost 4,000 people here in the first couple, two or three hours of the stream.
[412:56.36]I also started late, too.
[412:58.24]So... I started like an hour plus late, so... No, I don't ever expect people to... You know, if you're not interested in that, no, that's fine.
[413:11.65]There's still a lot of fucking people here.
[413:14.53]More than like 2, 2,500, 2,000 people.
[413:15.97]That's a lot of fucking people.
[413:27.65]I had a great time.
[413:34.94]But let me look at the calendar because today is technically Friday.
[413:40.66]Tomorrow... I don't know.
[413:46.37]I kind of can't... This is the weird kind of spot that I'm in with all the games that I have to play.
[413:51.51]So a Dreamcast stream is really going to have to be
[413:58.70]That's gonna be over at least a couple of streams.
[414:01.94]A game like this needs to be streamed more than once.
[414:04.38]Starting like Dark Souls 3 Insane Mod Night, that's... that's... Can't just do that one day, right?
[414:09.99]I have to think of how I want to block this out and do this.
[414:20.88]I got Shenmue, I have all those classic Dreamcast games.
[414:28.40]I'll figure it out.
[414:29.08]So expect tomorrow... And I don't know.
[414:33.10]Maybe we'll just do this again tomorrow.
[414:35.60]Maybe.
[414:36.96]It's very possible.
[414:39.18]But if you don't see this tomorrow, then expect either the Dark Souls 3 Insane Night or some Dreamcast stuff.
[414:47.85]Or I also have Lifeline for PlayStation 2, which is the voice-activated, like... I don't even know what it is.
[414:54.83]I know it's like a voice-activated adventure game.
[415:07.18]And then the 23rd.
[415:08.18]Yeah, we got... There's a lot going on.
[415:09.70]So... Regardless, you'll see me tomorrow.
[415:12.40]We'll figure it out.
[415:14.06]Thanks for sticking around.
[415:14.82]If you're leaving, we're gonna do the bits.
[415:17.38]And the subs.
[415:19.14]See ya.
[415:19.52]Thanks for watching.
[415:21.82]See y'all tomorrow.
[415:24.60]What's the usual time to stream?
[415:27.02]I... You... Okay, I think... No, thank God.
[415:29.28]I just clicked it.
[415:29.84]I think I just shot that guy, but I didn't.
[415:32.56]Alright, we're gonna save it.
[415:34.66]I usually start around 3 p.m.
[415:36.26]Pacific.
[415:39.81]which is 6 p.m.
[415:40.99]Eastern.
[415:49.18]Let me just exit the game because it's kind of... I can't really alt-tab out of it.
[415:53.04]There we go.
[415:55.04]Quit the game.
[415:55.68]7 a.m.
[416:05.63]for Aussies.
[416:10.70]That's so strange to think about that.
[416:12.04]Think of how weird that is.
[416:14.70]It's a 14 hour difference, isn't it?
[416:17.39]No, more than that.
[416:19.47]17 hour difference?
[416:26.97]That's wild.
[416:31.78]But let's go through the bits.
[416:35.08]See you all tomorrow.
[416:37.46]Hopefully this time starting at 3, not like 4.
[416:40.40]Pacific.
[416:41.70]Hey Jess, thanks for the $1.
[416:43.10]Give Shito the autotune voice modulator.
[416:50.18]Actually, that's not a bad idea.
[416:52.61]I gotta set that up though.
[416:53.49]I have to change what my input is and everything.
[416:55.85]It's gonna take a few minutes, so we'll do that another time.
[416:58.73]Because I don't have access to that changer right now.
[417:01.87]I probably have to restart some stuff.
[417:05.31]But it's a good idea.
[417:07.73]Like, you Alec for the one dollar?
[417:09.61]Jerma, when are your shirts coming out?
[417:10.87]I'm dying.
[417:13.45]Well, let me, I'll explain the t-shirt thing.
[417:16.45]So, a while back, Ashley and I, we're like, hey, let's do another shirt.
[417:24.42]And the shirt is, if you don't know, it is the solar system.
[417:27.75]It's a beautiful picture of the actual solar system.
[417:31.51]There's some really nice nuanced stuff.
[417:33.63]There's a boy and a man and his son, you know, looking through a telescope at the actual night sky.
[417:39.12]It's a beautiful shirt.
[417:41.58]A couple months went by, and another emote was added, which was a different planet.
[417:49.06]Oh, I probably should put that on, too.
[417:50.98]Another month went by.
[417:51.84]Oh, wait, hold on.
[417:53.88]We got, like, two more planet emotes.
[417:56.69]So eventually it got to a point where this shirt kept on getting pushed because we just... I kept adding planet emotes.
[418:07.66]So, to save the space on the shirt, there are a couple of planet omissions.
[418:15.60]Just because it all wouldn't fit on the shirt well.
[418:21.91]For instance, jermaSaturn doesn't exist.
[418:23.87]It's not there.
[418:25.86]That planet's gonna get deleted in the next Jerma Rumble anyways.
[418:35.42]Jerma Mercury is also not on there.
[418:42.17]Pluto's on there.
[418:42.97]The only ones that aren't on there are Saturn, Mercury,
[418:50.38]And... I think that's the only two that aren't on there.
[418:58.48]Jupiter's on there?
[418:59.20]Oh, of course it is.
[419:02.44]Yeah, you gotta have Jupiter on there.
[419:11.79]But it'll be a real- it's a nice shirt.
[419:13.45]It's really, really interesting.
[419:14.67]It's really fun.
[419:19.10]And it is going to be on sale very soon because I literally just talked to her again.
[419:24.76]And we're going to go from there.
[419:29.46]So expect it within, I would, at some point before the end of January.
[419:35.92]So either the last week of January or the first week of February is probably when it'll be on sale.
[419:41.27]And the Glue Man shirt's coming back too.
[419:42.57]So they'll both be on sale.
[419:50.35]Because there's really no other reason why that would be held back at all.
[419:54.31]Because the shirt is pretty much done.
[419:57.00]And the Glue Man shirt already is done.
[419:58.48]It's the same artwork.
[420:00.22]It's just going back on sale.
[420:06.72]Hopefully that answers your question.
[420:08.77]Thank you for the $1.
[420:09.51]Thank you Bake Me Home for the $1.
[420:11.59]Thank you Divis for the $2.
[420:13.79]Thank you Mr. Dask for the $5.
[420:16.91]Their master works all.
[420:18.95]You can't go wrong.
[420:22.99]Oh, oh.
[420:23.43]The master works all, you can't go wrong.
[420:26.25]Where have I... I keep hearing that.
[420:29.28]Where have I heard that before?
[420:30.32]The master works all, you can't go wrong.
[420:38.82]Master works all, you can't go wrong.
[420:47.69]No, wait.
[420:48.07]Did I already forget...
[420:52.09]It's from the game.
[420:52.89]No, I know, but what?
[420:54.65]It's a star subsound?
[420:56.93]Okay, that's probably why.
[420:59.91]That's definitely where I know it from, then.
[421:04.29]Why that has a subsound?
[421:11.85]But then again, what the fuck is my subsound?
[421:22.20]Mine's worse.
[421:22.78]Mine's way worse.
[421:26.30]I gotta change those.
[421:27.68]I might just drop the sound off completely.
[421:32.63]Or do it with something else.
[421:34.09]I never know what the hell it'll do.
[421:37.09]Replace it with something else.
[421:38.89]Don't do that!
[421:42.31]We'll see.
[421:43.66]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $1.
[421:45.26]I can't believe they made a game about the Dogma from Monster Hunter.
[421:50.60]The Dodogma
[421:56.02]I played Monster Hunter, what's the dogma?
[422:01.25]Hey, C4G, thanks for the $1.25.
[422:02.45]Here you go, sonny.
[422:03.31]Use this dollar in a shiny quarter to buy yourself a brand new Dreamcast.
[422:09.75]New Dreamcaster.
[422:15.30]The Dreamcast was not expensive.
[422:18.70]It's all these rare Dreamcast games that are like a hundred plus dollars each.
[422:27.23]I severely underestimated just how rare some of this stuff actually was.
[422:34.30]Thank you Sad Vega for the one dollar.
[422:35.88]Hey Jerma, I know you won't see this till after the stream, but there are some great mods for this game that improve the graphics and look of the game without changing its mechanics.
[422:44.59]Unless you want to change mechanics.
[422:47.07]Go check out Nexus Mods and don't get the blind me mod.
[422:51.37]I know, and get the Don't Blind Me mod.
[422:53.57]Really helpful with lightning effects.
[422:55.49]I was actually going to say that.
[422:58.87]I was thinking that, but I didn't say it.
[423:01.79]That every time the lightning struck, it was kind of unnerving to my brain.
[423:10.81]I will at least go get that one.
[423:15.39]And also the Resonant ENB Grand Sys Texture Improvement.
[423:19.82]There's also a handy-dandy mod pack that I think is most popular that improves most things.
[423:25.47]I'll probably just go get it.
[423:26.99]Especially the lightning stuff.
[423:28.73]And some of the other, maybe, graphic updates.
[423:34.35]But, uh, thank you, I appreciate that, because I... The lightning thing is something I was thinking but wasn't saying.
[423:40.28]Hey, Dan with Wings, thanks for the $10, Dan.
[423:41.96]Hey, Jerma, I haven't been able to resub for the last couple of months since I wasn't working due to school.
[423:47.56]Figured I'd give back by giving some community subs and bits from my favorite streamer.
[423:51.80]Also, you introduced me to Celeste, which I am enjoying a lot.
[423:57.28]That's not surprising.
[423:58.12]Celeste is a really, really, really great, fun, challenging platformer.
[424:03.71]No surprise that you're enjoying it.
[424:07.97]But thank you for your community subs and thank you for the $10.
[424:11.59]No one is ever under any obligation to pay me.
[424:14.97]Please keep that in mind.
[424:18.49]But thank you so much regardless.
[424:22.95]Online Influencer?
[424:27.12]One guy bought it.
[424:31.54]How many people bought Celeste after the two Celeste streams?
[424:36.70]That's not a great return on investment if I was a game company.
[424:42.07]What, like 11 people buy it?
[424:43.83]Okay, imagine if like... Imagine if even a hundred people downloaded Celeste.
[424:59.84]Celeste is how much money?
[425:01.84]20 bucks?
[425:07.73]So if it's $20, so that would be, like, what?
[425:09.99]Like, 100 copies would be a two grand, right?
[425:17.18]So imagine if I had been, like, paid.
[425:19.30]I'm not saying that I... I'm not saying I was.
[425:23.26]Or this is the exact amount of money I would get.
[425:24.82]But imagine if I was paid to, like, promote that game.
[425:28.55]And only, like, 80 people bought it.
[425:35.69]Well, they would have made money, but would they have though?
[425:37.72]Because they would have had to pay me, right?
[425:44.10]True, but at least you still get paid.
[425:49.14]But those 80 people convinced two other people to buy it, so then you got 80 people telling two people, then two people telling 80, and then 80 more people, then all of a sudden, that's 200,000 sales over the course of like six months.
[426:07.05]How much do you charge per stream?
[426:08.43]I've never done it, so I don't know.
[426:09.61]I have no idea.
[426:17.79]Probably like $30.
[426:18.69]Probably $30.
[426:22.47]No, no.
[426:22.77]It would have to be... It would have to be like... You know what?
[426:26.55]It would be like... It would be $1,000 per person watching.
[426:35.21]Well, that would be way too much.
[426:36.95]Maybe, what would it be?
[426:38.34]Per viewer.
[426:39.36]100 bucks per viewer.
[426:41.78]Because, you know, that's how valuable these viewers are.
[426:44.34]These aren't just some simple run-of-the-mill fucking viewers.
[426:47.22]Okay?
[426:48.42]I could sell you guys so hard.
[426:52.45]You know, I could talk about how you guys are some of the most valuable viewers on Twitch.
[426:56.33]And it would be, I'd be telling the truth.
[426:57.89]But that marketing person would hear that.
[427:06.44]I'm only worth a hundred bucks, that's pretty cheap.
[427:10.42]Well, a hundred times sixteen hundred is... that's a lot.
[427:16.89]That would mean... sixteen hundred, that's... oh my god.
[427:20.35]That's too... that's way too much money.
[427:24.28]That's a hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
[427:28.59]Okay, you know what?
[427:29.43]I'll stream... I will stream... Fallout 5.
[427:32.95]But I want $160,000.
[427:33.61]And that's... 1,600 people... There were 35, 3,800 people here earlier.
[427:35.87]That's almost a half million dollars to stream it.
[427:38.90]No, I don't do sponsored streams, so...
[427:59.78]I never have and I don't think I ever will.
[428:09.63]You mean your audience is the easiest to manipulate?
[428:13.95]What?
[428:17.79]Fairway Solitaire doesn't count because that was like on YouTube like six years ago.
[428:22.98]It's the only time I've ever done it.
[428:24.96]I've never done it ever since.
[428:26.48]And that was, I already made a video.
[428:28.54]Listen to me, hold on a minute.
[428:29.40]Let me defend myself.
[428:30.90]I made a Fairway Solitaire video because I liked the game a lot.
[428:35.71]The company then contacted me and said, hey, you want to give the game away to a bunch of people?
[428:41.31]And I was like, sure.
[428:42.43]I think the game's fun.
[428:43.75]It was later.
[428:44.65]It was after that.
[428:48.70]And it was just, you could just download the game for free if you used a code.
[428:50.80]You don't even have to pay for anything.
[428:53.03]I was like, hold on, it's just gonna be free.
[428:54.77]Like, no questions asked.
[428:55.71]The game's free.
[428:57.19]They're like, yes.
[428:58.39]If they use your code.
[429:00.19]Okay, that's it.
[429:00.79]The game is just for free.
[429:02.23]It was like a $2 game at the time.
[429:04.63]And now the game is just free.
[429:07.47]Years later.
[429:17.33]You sounded defensive.
[429:21.54]No, I don't do sponsored streams.
[429:25.04]Because... I don't like the dynamic.
[429:29.40]I don't... It doesn't sit well with me for a few reasons because... I have nothing against it.
[429:36.08]If people want to make some extra money, you know, that's fine.
[429:40.36]If it's relevant to what they're doing, that's fine.
[429:42.72]But I just don't like it.
[429:45.68]Like, why in the name of God would I ever play, like, some free-to-play card game for like an hour and a half?
[429:52.70]Like, why would that ever happen?
[429:53.75]You know what I'm saying?
[429:54.39]I would never do that.
[430:08.13]What if it's a game you enjoy?
[430:10.64]Yeah, that's fine, but that's not typically how it works from my last five plus years doing things on the internet.
[430:21.12]It's always like the game that nobody actually really wants to play.
[430:25.99]We'll give you a shitload of money if you play it.
[430:28.49]I don't want to do that.
[430:31.22]It's not like- I mean, sure, there are people that have, you know, sponsored streams from companies like, you know, like, Ubisoft, and, I mean, I've- that might not even be real, but I know that there are large companies that do them, but a lot of them are games that people might not even really necessarily care about in the first place.
[430:49.06]At least that's how it was like on YouTube.
[431:00.80]If the makers of 700,000 games offered you 10 grand to play Volume 3, would you take the money?
[431:04.86]No.
[431:07.85]I'd be like, I'll pay for it, but the game... Well, actually, you know what?
[431:11.05]How about this?
[431:12.09]Sure, I'll do that.
[431:13.85]Every single one of those games has to open, though.
[431:16.49]And if the games... If one game on that list doesn't open, I get triple the money.
[431:27.61]for each one that doesn't open.
[431:29.94]That'll light the fire under the Aston to make sure that they work.
[431:39.28]Sounds like a good deal.
[431:40.56]Wait, we got some Shito fan art.
[431:53.03]Oh, that's really cute.
[431:59.83]Everybody loves Shito.
[432:04.25]If a game developer sent you a game copy or a review copy, would you take it?
[432:08.36]No, and here's the reason why.
[432:10.24]Here are the reasons why I don't do sponsored streams and I don't like to take free games.
[432:15.64]Or press games, press copies.
[432:17.76]Because I think about it differently.
[432:21.05]If I get a copy of a game for free, or if I get a sponsored game, it will change the way that I talk, it'll change the way that I do things, because I know that this was given to me, or this was sponsored, and it just is in the back of my mind.
[432:37.46]Me paying for a game, or me just buying it and doing whatever I want with it, I am at my own free will to do whatever I want.
[432:45.85]If I were to take a game for free, and then say a bunch of shit about it, it'd be like... Okay, well, I... Like, hey, wait, wait, wait, why are you doing that?
[433:01.06]I would rather not hinder anything that I ever wanted to say or do.
[433:07.18]Because I know a lot of sponsored streams, they say, hey, you can kind of say what you want, but don't do anything, don't be so bad, you know?
[433:13.38]I don't know, I would be afraid that somebody would rip my fucking contract in half.
[433:17.73]Because I'd come across like a bug that I didn't like, and I'd be like, fuck this game.
[433:20.87]And all of a sudden it was like, the piano fucking falls from the ceiling.
[433:36.78]It's like if you get a Christmas present, you have to pretend to like it.
[433:40.48]Yeah, but I'm not even sure the answer is pretending to like it.
[433:43.80]It's just knowing that it was given to you for a reason.
[433:50.27]There's pretending to like it, and then there's knowing that you were given this thing for a very specific reason.
[434:03.26]It's also difficult to judge something fairly if you didn't
[434:06.57]Yeah, but I mean, journalistic approach.
[434:11.22]If you're a journalistic outlet, if you're a game reviewer, or... I don't think there's... Maybe there's not something actually wrong with it if your company is based around doing full-on breakdowns of games.
[434:30.59]Maybe it is.
[434:31.71]Maybe that goes against it completely.
[434:40.99]Feel free to say whatever you want as long as it's not negative or discourages people from buying the product.
[434:46.95]I just can't have that a little bit over my head.
[434:48.81]Even if I like it.
[434:54.20]Some people are better at dealing with promotions, you're just not one of them.
[434:58.34]Yeah, and I don't have anything wrong with it.
[435:01.36]There's nothing in my brain that says, that's wrong what you're doing.
[435:06.50]But, also keep this in mind too.
[435:11.74]At the end of the day, you guys are watching a stream, and what you see on the stream is what you... In your mind, it's something that I have decided that I wanted to show you, right?
[435:28.63]And if I tell you, with this 3,000 or 4,000 people here, Hey, check this out!
[435:34.73]Isn't that really cool?
[435:35.83]Check it out!
[435:38.81]I don't want to be disingenuous of the things that I'm showing you.
[435:48.99]Because there's a lot of people that come to streams and they, oh, I want to, what, what are you doing today?
[435:56.00]Oh, it's something that you necessarily didn't decide to do.
[435:59.96]You decided to do it, but for a different reason, not because you wanted to show your audience something because maybe you were offered money to, from a company to show it, not necessarily you wanting to do it.
[436:17.93]And it has nothing to do with honesty, it really did- I- it- I did say I used the word disingenuous.
[436:25.17]But... If I- let's just put it this way, if I got fucking 10 grand to play a shitty mobile game on stream and pretend I was having fun, some of you guys would download it, and you'd be like, this game sucked.
[436:35.94]This was stupid.
[436:37.50]Why did he do that?
[436:39.18]Oh, he did- he took a bunch of money, okay, I guess.
[436:42.22]Right?
[436:42.44]Like, they would- that's the reason.
[436:54.03]I think it's nice that you want to show us something that you'd really enjoy or at least try to enjoy.
[436:57.27]I mean, that's... From my view, that's what I want to do here.
[437:08.56]And the money coming in... People talk about money and making money and... A shitload of money comes in already.
[437:15.34]A lot.
[437:19.64]A lot.
[437:22.05]So, I mean, could I make more money?
[437:24.67]Could I make way more money?
[437:25.93]I don't know.
[437:26.27]Maybe.
[437:27.45]If I took a bunch of sponsored streams and deals.
[437:29.60]But I don't, like, I don't have to do that.
[437:31.68]I don't, like, need to do that.
[437:39.79]And if I can just kind of do my thing and not have to worry about taking, like, sponsor deals or... But that lies down, obviously...
[437:48.82]The reason why I'm able to do that is because so many people do sub to the stream and do give money.
[437:54.41]So I don't like, I don't have to go get like, oh, I'm gonna get, I want to get like a $10,000 sponsorship.
[438:02.48]It's not, it's not really that necessary.
[438:06.14]Because like you guys already, you guys already do that.
[438:08.53]You already give a shitload of money.
[438:16.04]This may be a weird question, but how do you handle such a large amount of donations tax-wise?
[438:22.16]Oh, it's, I mean, it's just, it's classified as, you know, like income, like tips.
[438:26.92]It's just money.
[438:30.68]Goes through Twitch.
[438:33.23]Even with PayPal, it's still classified as tips, right?
[438:36.55]And you have to pay taxes on tips.
[438:48.90]Stop having integrity.
[438:52.24]But I don't want to come off as like the I'm the last bastion of integrity on the platform.
[439:00.29]No.
[439:01.97]There are plenty of ways to run a live stream.
[439:09.73]And there are plenty of other people that don't do like sponsors.
[439:13.43]There are a lot of them.
[439:15.13]I'm not the only one.
[439:20.37]And like I've said 10 minutes ago, I don't have a negative attitude towards somebody that does.
[439:46.72]Classified actually means he doesn't do his taxes.
[439:50.07]Wait, what?
[439:53.87]I have... I have... I'm about to do them in, like... I'm about to file my return, probably in a week or two.
[440:05.38]So... And I got a... Actually, I have a very, very good CPA.
[440:11.66]Very trustworthy.
[440:17.32]Evading.
[440:17.90]No.
[440:18.30]No.
[440:22.01]Just, Jerma, ignore this message.
[440:23.77]I can't.
[440:24.15]You have the one guy emote there.
[440:31.72]Teach us how to do taxes?
[440:34.02]It's, uh, alright.
[440:36.00]You wanna know how to do your taxes?
[440:39.06]Just dip yourself in fucking, like, just get, just buy like a giant friolator.
[440:45.10]And then dip yourself in it.
[440:46.72]On max heat.
[440:48.86]That's what it's like.
[440:54.95]Buy the Tune Liquid from Who Framed Roger Rabbit and just slowly sit in it.
[441:13.08]Sounds about right.
[441:19.05]Just eat the paper!
[441:26.42]But it won't work.
[441:27.12]We aren't toons.
[441:28.64]Um... What?
[441:34.28]You're on a toon stream right now.
[441:35.84]Hey, how do you feel about urinals?
[441:43.80]Let me tell you something.
[441:45.79]Alright, let's move on now.
[441:47.43]Spent a lot of time talking about that.
[441:50.11]But it's nice to discuss it every now and again.
[441:55.90]Because there are pros and cons to all these things.
[442:00.28]You know, like, think about that.
[442:02.87]To put one last point into that conversation, imagine if I did a couple of sponsored streams, and then all of a sudden that pays for Jerma Rumble 2.
[442:11.92]You know what I mean?
[442:13.62]Like, there are pros and cons.
[442:16.74]But the cons for me have always been...
[442:19.36]out kind of grown I mean the cons the cons have outgrown the pros for me pretty much every time I think about it I've thought about it a lot this ain't something that I've just kind of hey let's talk about this now I internalize this all the time
[442:42.36]But, thank you, Dan with Wings.
[442:45.08]That was where we left off.
[442:46.92]Uh, Drum Age.
[442:48.14]Thank you, Drum Age, for the $1.
[442:49.76]Hey, you probably don't even remember the cheer about Lisa.
[442:54.98]Uh... And begging for it, but still want to apologize for it.
[442:58.84]It was wasted as fuck, like, right now.
[443:02.74]No, don't worry about it.
[443:05.60]Don't worry about that.
[443:06.36]It's alright.
[443:10.04]You recommended a game to me.
[443:12.43]Oh, no, I think I know what you're talking about.
[443:13.67]When I brought up moving to another game and I just used the word Lisa, I think that's because you were the last message that I saw about a game recommendation, and that was just the last game recommendation that I saw.
[443:27.42]That has nothing to do with what you said or how you said it or something, no.
[443:33.14]You were the one guy, and that's how that happened.
[443:38.82]People have been asking for Lisa a trillion times.
[443:41.15]I suggested it a year ago.
[443:43.79]Yeah, but every, okay, every time somebody suggests Lisa, they are sandwiched by two people saying, don't play Lisa.
[443:53.46]You know, there's like a, I just like burped really loud and then hopefully the music covered it.
[444:11.62]If anyone doesn't want Lisa... Play it now.
[444:18.72]It's a good-ass game series, but I feel like it's not for you.
[444:24.45]Maybe.
[444:24.93]I don't know.
[444:28.95]You should not play Lisa.
[444:30.25]It's too sad to make it a fun stream.
[444:32.83]That's kind of what I hear.
[444:34.93]that it's a great game, but streaming it is like it's a sad game.
[444:39.61]And it wouldn't be like a fun stream, it would be like a sad stream.
[444:43.43]Is that accurate?
[444:51.61]You'd have to take it seriously.
[444:57.61]We'll see, I'll put it on the list.
[445:02.48]I don't know.
[445:03.58]That's tough, because I don't want to be, like, sad on stream.
[445:07.48]I don't want to be sad in general, either.
[445:10.32]But thank you, Drummage, for the $1.
[445:12.42]$2 here.
[445:13.32]Could you check out Age of Empires 2 for lulls sometime?
[445:16.82]If not, could you at least give your thoughts on it?
[445:19.88]If I even know what it is.
[445:21.31]It's one of the original real-time strategy games that predated everything else.
[445:25.55]I know what it is.
[445:27.35]I watched a guy play that on a plane when I was, like, 14.
[445:32.34]I was sitting in the aisle seat, and he was one row above and in the aisle seat to the right, so he was diagonal to me, and he had a laptop on the plane.
[445:43.82]I had to have been like 14 or 15 at the time.
[445:45.94]He was older, he was probably in his like mid to late 30s, and I was just sitting there watching him play.
[445:54.29]And eventually he like noticed I was watching because I was just staring at his screen, and I said, what is that?
[446:00.03]And he said, this is, uh, Age of, uh, Age of Kings.
[446:05.80]It's Age of, Age of Empires 2 is Age of Kings, right?
[446:10.12]Age of Kings.
[446:12.32]Yeah.
[446:13.66]I got it.
[446:14.60]Age of Empires 2, Age of Kings.
[446:18.11]And I remember going, oh!
[446:20.67]This is a great watch.
[446:25.59]He was the game's lead developer.
[446:34.66]I just caught this right here in the chat here.
[446:37.59]Uh, Roshimi Swift recently diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis.
[446:43.27]Any good recipes or any lifestyle changes I should try?
[446:45.60]I understand you've had issues and I just wanted your input.
[446:52.61]Yeah, I don't know what your plan is for your doctor.
[446:57.58]I don't know what they're going to try first because there are a couple of different options for treatment.
[447:03.78]But lifestyle-wise, at least initially, you have to kind of start ruling out stuff that you can't really eat.
[447:13.01]For a while, I couldn't drink even, I don't know, I'm not sure how old you are, but I couldn't drink a sip of alcohol.
[447:20.60]If I even drank like one beer or like one cocktail, it would be living hell the next like three or four days.
[447:28.50]Except for some people have their own internal issues and some foods affect people differently, especially if you have colitis.
[447:42.73]I've since got into a pretty good
[447:46.04]run here where I haven't had any really major problems I still do have problems but you know I won't really discuss them on stream because they're kind of uh very disgusting and very not I don't I don't think I want to share those that stuff on stream but uh
[448:14.20]Wait, hold on.
[448:15.84]I'll touch on that in a second.
[448:17.12]Somebody just said about me being a kid in 1999.
[448:18.54]You would have been a teenager.
[448:22.38]I was like, I said 14 or 15, right?
[448:23.52]2009, 2019, that was 20 years ago.
[448:24.62]So I'm 33, 23, yeah, that's 13.
[448:25.32]I said 14.
[448:25.68]What are you talking about?
[448:27.96]Your math is off.
[448:28.42]My math is correct.
[448:47.49]But, uh, you really need to just kind of look at your diet.
[448:51.67]You start to rule out fried stuff, fatty stuff.
[448:58.03]And some people can eat whatever they want.
[449:01.98]And make sure you get a good doctor that's gonna give you a good treatment plan.
[449:10.24]Ask about... It's a very expensive drug, unfortunately, for some dumb fucking reason.
[449:17.25]But one of the things, because I had, mine started to localize itself.
[449:23.50]I don't know where yours is, but the drug is, Kanasa is the drug.
[449:31.78]And it helped me a lot because mine was a little bit lower.
[449:42.31]I'm not going to give you any recommendations for what you should take for drugs.
[449:45.79]But I had a lot of issues that eventually, after a couple of endoscopies, the doctors were like, you know, it's localized a little bit lower, so we're going to put you on this.
[450:05.92]It's a mesolamine?
[450:08.36]Mesolamine?
[450:10.40]It's like an aspirin kind of derivative.
[450:16.23]Scheduled for a colonoscopy in a couple weeks, but I was hospitalized for a good week due to pain.
[450:20.23]That's why I started seeing a GI specialist.
[450:23.17]Will definitely continue to see that specialist.
[450:25.91]Because you might get a little discouraged and not care and not want to do it.
[450:33.93]Oh, I got to go in.
[450:34.63]I got to get scoped.
[450:35.47]I got to get scoped.
[450:36.33]I got to try this.
[450:38.73]It's really easy to like kind of just fall down into like a depression and not give a fuck anymore.
[450:43.85]But keep going.
[450:45.65]Make sure that you get that doctor you on the right page.
[450:51.15]Then try to take care of yourself and get yourself into remission.
[450:55.44]It's a huge pain.
[450:57.30]But I feel pretty good right now.
[451:00.92]And I did not 10 years ago.
[451:02.94]Not at all.
[451:10.42]So I can relate.
[451:12.42]For real.
[451:18.98]I wish you the best.
[451:19.60]I wish you the best of luck.
[451:20.90]Hopefully you and your doctor can figure out a good plan.
[451:28.77]I thought I was lactose intolerant at first.
[451:31.87]Yeah.
[451:33.07]When I first started having problems, it was... I went through...
[451:39.38]I mean, I'm not gonna be disgusting or anything, but there was a bunch of weird shit that I did that the doctor was checking for.
[451:44.77]It took a... It took... It was after I got scoped for the first time that really it was, okay, I think this is what you have.
[451:55.01]And then from there, I got put on a couple of drugs that I really didn't like.
[452:01.32]And it's kind of sucks that I was on them for a while.
[452:10.39]I don't even know if they still prescribe it.
[452:12.81]Which is kind of terrifying in its own right.
[452:14.81]I wonder if this medicine even still exists.
[452:26.03]Eh, it does.
[452:38.17]Yeah, I was on Imuran for a long time.
[452:45.63]And I really didn't like it.
[452:48.11]But it may have been one of the reasons why I went into remission.
[452:51.59]I don't know.
[452:52.25]But I fucking hated that drug.
[452:56.32]I hated being on that drug.
[452:58.08]Because there's a lot of weird issues with it.
[453:10.58]Imagine Jerma as a celebrity.
[453:14.25]I don't think I want to imagine that.
[453:27.53]They definitely still prescribe Imuran.
[453:29.19]I was on it until last year.
[453:32.06]So, yes, they do.
[453:33.62]I don't know if they still did it.
[453:36.19]Because there's a lot of literature that it can really help.
[453:38.69]It's an immunomodulator.
[453:41.47]They prescribe it to people that do, like, kidney transplants.
[453:43.61]It's like a transplant acceptor drug.
[453:47.27]But it does have some weird effects on Crohn's and colitis.
[453:51.66]And IBD symptoms.
[453:54.12]So, it's just weird.
[453:55.02]That just freaked me out, taking it.
[453:56.22]Like an immunomodulator?
[453:59.02]Like, it's fucking with my DNA.
[454:07.69]But anyways, I wish you the best of luck.
[454:10.55]Take care of yourself, listen to your doctor, and get a good plan.
[454:17.69]But anyways, Age of Empire, Age of Kings.
[454:21.00]I am aware of it, and I think it was cool.
[454:29.16]Dubsky, dude, thanks for the $1.
[454:30.40]Dragon's Dogma is a special game to me.
[454:32.94]The most legendary gaming fail of my entire life happened in this game.
[454:36.97]I was soloing the Ur-Dragon, it's a secret boss, with like 20 health bars.
[454:43.69]And it literally took 6 hours for me to beat.
[454:47.33]When I finally killed it, it hit me with Petrify.
[454:51.13]I desperately tried to loot the corpse but turned to stone and died before I could grab anything.
[454:56.19]And I lost the loot forever.
[454:58.69]I literally wanted to eat my own head.
[455:05.86]That sucks.
[455:10.67]Six hours.
[455:14.61]That is rough.
[455:15.77]That's very rough.
[455:18.10]And that's the kind of stuff I can look forward to then.
[455:20.82]Bring it on.
[455:21.76]Sounds fun.
[455:23.96]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the $1.
[455:25.38]This game looks beautiful and ugly at the same time.
[455:27.32]It's because I don't have the mods to make it look better.
[455:29.74]That was my fault.
[455:31.68]Mindmyhalo, thank you for the $10.
[455:36.26]Smellyboy, thank you for the $1.
[455:38.60]Where is Shito?
[455:39.32]Show me proof that he's alive.
[455:50.41]He's saying, I am alive.
[455:51.33]He's alive.
[455:57.74]Alright.
[455:59.50]You ready to go back to bed?
[456:01.18]Good night.
[456:08.18]Pre-recorded Shito.
[456:11.50]Uh, thank you Fibbly Bibblies for the three bucks.
[456:14.26]They say it had to be done.
[456:20.33]I can't tell... Is... Did you... What?
[456:25.57]Is this an image of... My eyes on that character?
[456:29.33]Or is this the Willem Dafoe face?
[456:31.79]I don't know, but it's freaking me out.
[456:32.99]I can't look at that for more than five seconds.
[456:35.66]Don't look at that picture before you sleep.
[456:40.99]That monster will come out of your mirror or something.
[456:44.25]Hey, Smellyboy, thanks for the Wondola.
[456:45.61]Who's your favorite animator?
[456:47.85]On Newgrounds?
[456:49.43]I mean, blow it out.
[456:51.60]Come on.
[456:54.36]Hey, MostlyLost, thanks for the Wondola.
[456:55.88]Your resistance and hesitation to use any stupid, jokey characters is even funnier than the characters themselves.
[457:01.80]Especially since we all know you'll give in eventually.
[457:06.56]Well, I did.
[457:08.12]I played with two characters that had poop in their name.
[457:14.51]There was Poopbutt and then, like, Poopmaster.
[457:19.05]So, it happened.
[457:20.89]I told you, 30% of the characters have that word or a variant of that in their name.
[457:29.57]You're not going to be able to do a full playthrough of this game and not have one character in your party whose name is, like, Poo Poo Dick.
[457:36.17]It's not gonna happen.
[457:36.93]It's going to happen because you're gonna have the right spells and abilities that you're gonna need.
[457:39.67]And you're gonna want to bring him in just for, like, a couple minutes to do one mission.
[457:52.58]I can't believe somebody gave me all the end game items.
[457:54.98]What the f- I'm actually kind of sad.
[457:58.28]I just realized that.
[457:59.48]That image just popped up in my brain right now.
[458:06.52]Thank you Carrot7 for the one dollar.
[458:10.08]I fell asleep during your character creation.
[458:12.16]Woke up to a brave soul named Poopbutt being eaten by a Hydra.
[458:16.96]I like this game.
[458:21.00]That was so fucking funny.
[458:32.31]And the fact that a bunch of people said that they've never seen that cutscene before because I took too long to fight the tutorial boss.
[458:39.75]But that was because I was laughing and couldn't do anything.
[458:42.97]I was watching a guy named Poopbutt get fucking digested by a snake.
[458:47.93]What was I supposed to do?
[458:50.71]How are you supposed to react to that?
[459:01.07]There's no way you can react to that any differently.
[459:08.52]God, that was fucking funny.
[459:10.80]That took so much energy out of me, though.
[459:12.52]I was laughing so hard.
[459:18.66]It took it so long to go through.
[459:21.69]He started in the top of the mouth and I didn't- I never got him out and you just slowly see this like sleeping bag slowly just go down into the thing's stomach.
[459:37.29]This is called the save poop button.
[459:39.37]Is this it?
[459:44.45]Save poop button.
[459:45.59]He'll be fine.
[459:49.29]Oh, he's getting eaten!
[459:56.63]No!
[459:57.83]Save him!
[460:00.83]How do I save him?
[460:02.05]He's getting digested!
[460:03.71]Oh, fuck!
[460:07.83]Alright, somebody tell me.
[460:09.75]I don't care about spoilers or backseating.
[460:12.16]Are there more big, crazy, fucking hysterical bosses like that in this game?
[460:16.68]Or is that just kind of like one every...
[460:23.90]Yes, yes, okay.
[460:25.02]Well, then I'm absolutely going to play this again.
[460:32.86]If there is a shitload of dumb encounters where poop butt can get eaten... Yeah, you will absolutely be playing it again.
[460:54.43]But anyways, thank you to Carrot.
[460:58.38]Glad you rejoined us after sleeping.
[461:00.24]Bread Avi, thanks for the $5.
[461:01.84]Oh shit, Jerm is playing my favorite game.
[461:04.78]Can't stay and watch because I still have to catch up on my VOD homework.
[461:08.35]But here's my first bits to celebrate.
[461:10.67]Been watching since TF2, still as good as ever.
[461:13.59]Keep up the good work, Arnold.
[461:15.79]Definitely looking forward to this VOD and more to come.
[461:18.87]I gotta go.
[461:21.12]Thank you, Brett.
[461:22.47]You're not here.
[461:23.97]But maybe if you watch the VOD and you get to this point.
[461:27.95]Thank you, Brett Obby, for the $5.
[461:28.95]And thanks for sticking around as long as you have.
[461:32.63]Fuck yeah.
[461:35.51]Thank you, Dot Shaft, for the $10.
[461:36.70]Hey, Jerma, love the stream.
[461:37.82]I was thinking about donating a lot more, but decided to take off a dollar for every shortcut you didn't take during The Simpsons hit and run stream.
[461:48.42]So you're going to give
[461:51.51]$15?
[461:51.61]Okay.
[461:55.27]Thanks, though.
[461:55.69]Appreciate it.
[462:02.70]Thank you for the $10, Dotshaft.
[462:04.46]Appreciate that.
[462:04.96]Thank you.
[462:06.90]Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $10, Freudian.
[462:10.10]I had a bit of a rough week, but your streams always help lift my spirits.
[462:13.00]Thanks.
[462:14.02]jermaHeart PS.
[462:15.80]Tell Shito that I said hi.
[462:20.60]I will.
[462:20.96]Hey.
[462:21.88]Shito?
[462:25.18]Yeah?
[462:26.30]A Frodean weapon wants to say hello to you.
[462:29.00]Do you say hi back?
[462:30.79]No!
[462:31.33]Why?
[462:31.75]I don't think they said that.
[462:38.99]Did you... No, I don't think you did.
[462:41.55]Did you... Did you... Frodean, did you...
[462:44.20]Hold on, I'll talk to him.
[462:45.02]You want me to talk to him?
[462:46.60]Okay.
[462:48.18]Did you say he was the worst character behind Grail Master?
[462:51.49]That's what he said you said.
[462:56.37]I'm talking to him right now, don't worry.
[463:07.95]Ban?
[463:08.27]Ban?
[463:08.49]No, I just... I think he might be mistaken.
[463:11.90]I don't think that was the person you're talking about.
[463:15.60]Are you sure?
[463:20.06]I don't think you're right.
[463:20.90]I don't think you're right.
[463:22.42]It wasn't Freudian Weapon, I'm telling you.
[463:25.83]I've been watching the chat.
[463:30.25]Alright.
[463:31.83]If I give you a little treat later, will you cut this out?
[463:37.92]I can't make you spaghetti.
[463:41.10]The spaghetti takes like 40 minutes to make.
[463:45.78]Alright, fine, I'll give you spaghetti.
[463:49.22]God.
[463:53.09]I'll wake you up when it's done.
[463:56.41]Fucking spaghetti.
[463:57.13]I have to make spaghetti for this little wonderful boy.
[464:07.17]But thank you for already in weapon, and I wanted to relay that information that you did not say those things.
[464:12.65]Thank you for the $10.
[464:14.67]Thank you P337R for the $3.
[464:16.83]Hey, JERMA985.
[464:21.03]Remember when we used to not spell out each other's names?
[464:24.74]I do remember.
[464:27.18]Try saying remember.
[464:29.12]Remember's a really hard word for me.
[464:30.46]I don't know why.
[464:32.38]Remember.
[464:33.10]Sometimes I just go remember.
[464:33.82]Remember.
[464:35.74]Remember.
[464:38.99]Thank you so much, Peter.
[464:42.13]For the three bucks.
[464:42.81]Thank you, Apex!
[464:45.30]Apex, you were, for the one dollar.
[464:47.74]I'm gonna borrow your pawn real quick and send them back holding a hoe for such a lame, unoriginal fetish pawn.
[464:57.70]What?
[465:03.39]I don't understand.
[465:11.46]Who is that?
[465:13.60]Shito's in the chat right now.
[465:14.93]What is that?
[465:19.99]What emote is that?
[465:35.70]Thank you, Apex.
[465:36.38]Thank you, Mandum, for the $2.
[465:38.88]Mandum Requiem.
[465:41.34]We have the $50,500, 5000 bits from a wild Merrill.
[465:47.37]Thank you so much for your 50 bucks.
[465:51.86]I'll put that to good use.
[465:53.42]Thank you.
[465:55.32]Timmy Tim-Tam, thanks for the $1.
[465:56.34]They just say H. That's it?
[466:03.99]Dorkcube, thanks for the $1.
[466:05.57]All praise Poopbutt the True Arisen.
[466:09.91]Thank you for giving us this great character, Jeremy.
[466:11.87]I can't wait to see him duke it out with all your other great creations in the next Jerma Rumble.
[466:18.97]Well, and then right after that, for $10 is Poopbutt True Arisen.
[466:24.35]That's the name of the person in the chat.
[466:30.00]Have I done something to anger you that you would lie to these people about my inception?
[466:34.22]No, you may not have created me in the traditional sense, but rather you willed me into existence.
[466:39.97]I am the embodiment of the type of Arisen you wish you could be.
[466:44.33]And for bringing me into this world, I say thanks, Dad.
[466:47.13]Kappa.
[466:50.42]Thank you, Poopbutt True Arisen for the $10.00.
[466:55.84]It was an honor not making you but putting you in my party because I got peer pressured into pressing the button.
[467:02.36]Thank you.
[467:04.14]Hey Grill Master, thanks for the $1.
[467:06.28]Grill Master pro tip of the day.
[467:09.14]Grilling meatloaf can be tricky due to its consistency.
[467:12.72]Try adding a coating of fondant to the loaf before placing it on the grill.
[467:18.25]It'll toughen up the meat and make it much easier to grill.
[467:23.74]Thank you.
[467:24.60]Grill Master BBQX.
[467:29.98]Grill Master BBQX.
[467:37.05]Hey, Have Gun.
[467:38.55]Thanks you for the $1.
[467:40.11]Hey, Jerm, I'm really enjoying the stream.
[467:41.81]Since everyone is making anime recommendations, I suggest Gun's X Sword.
[467:46.59]A sci-fi spaghetti western with a good English dub, here's the opening in its least spoilery version.
[467:51.92]Think you would enjoy it.
[467:58.50]Who's making recommendations?
[468:01.12]Well, this person right now.
[468:08.88]God, I fucking hate Grill Master x BBQ.
[468:13.41]I... look.
[468:16.47]That has nothing to do with this latest bit.
[468:21.54]But thank you for the ref- Thank you for the reference.
[468:25.54]Hopefully when I, you know, when the application will maybe give you a call and just tell them what I've done and things that you did.
[468:35.23]I really appreciate the reference.
[468:36.23]Thank you.
[468:40.11]Lentils, thanks for the $1.
[468:43.51]When are you going to play more games like Katamari?
[468:45.49]I really enjoyed that stream.
[468:47.03]Joined the stream late today, but it looked fun.
[468:50.63]There are a lot of Katamari games.
[468:53.41]Maybe one day we could go and play the next one in Succession or... Succession.
[468:57.67]It's letters with a C. Multiple C's and S's and multiple R's and E's and M's.
[469:02.47]That's when I have the most problems.
[469:04.09]Succession.
[469:05.55]Succession.
[469:07.37]I'm just... My brain is going too fast.
[469:08.67]Slow down.
[469:12.75]Are there any games that are like Katamari?
[469:15.77]Katamari.
[469:16.89]There's four or five of them.
[469:20.88]But yeah, it's a great game.
[469:22.42]Hey Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[469:23.70]No, thank you Snowsoup4u for the $1.
[469:29.21]Thank you Tingy for the $1.
[469:32.03]Thank you Jules for the $1.
[469:33.11]Jerma, I see you wear some superhero shirts, so I gotta ask, who's your favorite super person?
[469:38.65]Nightwing, Aquaman, Green Goblin?
[469:40.49]Ah.
[469:45.71]Favorite superhero.
[469:49.52]Hmm.
[469:54.40]That is a very hard question.
[469:59.30]Uh, General Grievous.
[470:05.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[470:14.98]Not Ben 10.
[470:16.38]Ben 10 doesn't count.
[470:21.18]I'd really hate to be...
[470:25.03]Like a bandwagon shithead here.
[470:28.13]I hate it, but I hate to say this.
[470:30.83]Everyone's gonna be like, of course you're gonna say that, because of the last movie.
[470:33.94]Thanos.
[470:36.90]I know, I know, it's like, okay, yeah, bro, you like that because of the last movie that came out.
[470:42.68]Probably.
[470:43.14]Thanos is a villain.
[470:51.45]Well, they said, who is your favorite super person?
[470:54.91]Nightwing, Aquaman, Green Goblin.
[470:57.59]They put a villain in the question.
[471:04.15]I think Thanos is a great character.
[471:10.08]Now, if you talk about on the good side, not just a villain...
[471:23.22]Thanos is actually pretty good in Infinity War.
[471:28.44]Movie Thanos or Comic Thanos?
[471:30.14]I mean, there are differences.
[471:32.57]And I know the whole story.
[471:33.49]I know Thanos' entire story.
[471:37.47]But every time I bring up something that somebody hasn't seen yet, I get screamed after spoilers.
[471:46.39]You have no idea what Comic Thanos is.
[471:50.32]Oh, well, block your ears for a second, everybody, if you don't want to hear anything.
[471:52.90]The whole three, two, one.
[471:55.34]I don't know anything about Thanos.
[471:57.94]Except the fact that his entire life is about trying to please and fall in love with the actual embodiment of death.
[472:04.12]And that's why he does the things that he does, because he's trying to impress death.
[472:07.84]Pretty interesting take on the comic book version of the Thanos.
[472:18.84]He read the Wikipedia?
[472:21.08]I read the comic book!
[472:22.88]I have it!
[472:23.54]I own it!
[472:29.03]Okay, you can listen now.
[472:35.13]Show it on stream?
[472:36.37]You want to show it on stream?
[472:39.08]Fine.
[472:39.74]No, wait, actually that got lost in the mail during the move.
[472:50.85]I gave it to my nephew.
[473:04.20]You didn't even know that.
[473:12.27]It got lost and then you gave it to your nephew, huh?
[473:15.75]No, no, no!
[473:18.39]He's trying to make the embodiment of death.
[473:22.38]And that's why he does the things that he does.
[473:24.88]He travels from planet to planet.
[473:27.66]And look, guy that has one talking point, repeat the same talking point, but change the sentence a little bit.
[473:42.29]Good job, you read his TL;DR wiki.
[473:44.13]Alright, what do you know about him, huh?
[473:49.05]What do you know about him?
[473:50.59]If you're such an expert, let's hear it.
[473:55.77]Oh yeah?
[473:57.53]Hey, block your ears.
[473:58.57]Everybody block your ears.
[473:59.69]If you don't want to hear any Thanos spoilers.
[474:01.71]Three, two, one.
[474:04.39]The fact that the fight with Wolverine, the fight with Deadpool.
[474:07.93]The fact that Deadpool's the only one that could even hurt him in the first place because he didn't really lose the fight against Deadpool.
[474:14.65]Deadpool just was annoying because he wouldn't die.
[474:17.57]So Thanos just got bored and it turned out to be a victory for Deadpool.
[474:21.58]You remember that?
[474:22.12]Did you read that one?
[474:31.89]I just made that up?
[474:33.48]That means that I have more knowledge of the superhero universe than Gondor Lane does.
[474:37.66]I will take the victory.
[474:39.80]Thank you very much.
[474:40.58]Leveled up to a level one million.
[474:53.28]You have the wiki?
[474:54.16]I don't have the wiki open.
[475:02.64]frantically browsing on his phone.
[475:04.80]Am I?
[475:05.12]Really?
[475:06.22]I'm browsing on my phone?
[475:07.44]I don't even know what my phone is.
[475:11.45]Anyways, let's finish the bits.
[475:12.89]It's Thanos.
[475:16.43]Favorite superhero?
[475:17.21]I don't know.
[475:18.05]Doctor fucking Strange.
[475:20.01]Or Spider-Man.
[475:21.07]Or Venom.
[475:21.49]No!
[475:22.19]Let's go back.
[475:22.73]Sorry.
[475:23.29]It's not Thanos.
[475:24.43]No!
[475:24.61]What the fuck am I talking about?
[475:25.61]It's not Venom either.
[475:27.17]It's Carnage.
[475:28.21]Carnage is my favorite superhero or villain.
[475:31.98]Carnage is a great character.
[475:34.00]It's Carnage.
[475:36.11]What do you know about Carnage?
[475:37.29]Separation of Anxiety storyline.
[475:40.67]It's one of my favorite actual, no jokes aside, not kidding or anything.
[475:44.71]The Separation of Anxiety story arc with Spider-Man, Venom, and Carnage is my favorite Marvel storyline.
[475:54.98]And I would love if they would actually do it eventually.
[476:07.83]What about Ant-Man, though?
[476:09.65]Oh, fuck Ant-Man.
[476:11.53]They took Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and made Paul Rudd say some jokes.
[476:15.80]It's like they tell Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, but they give the kids superpowers.
[476:18.32]I've already seen that movie.
[476:25.91]I'm kidding.
[476:27.11]I'm kidding.
[476:27.71]That's a joke.
[476:35.76]That was an expert Ant-Man analysis.
[476:37.70]I'm just pushing buttons right now.
[476:39.51]Don't you understand?
[476:41.57]I almost just pushed the camera on button.
[476:43.71]As a joke.
[476:44.19]Like I'm pressing buttons and I don't have clothes on.
[476:45.91]So that would have been bad.
[476:57.42]He likes to start shit.
[476:59.30]I'm just kidding around.
[477:01.80]Venom is one of my favorite...
[477:04.80]Carnage is... I just like the symbiotes.
[477:06.08]They're interesting.
[477:08.74]Something about them are cool.
[477:09.84]The Spider-Man symbiote was really interesting.
[477:11.60]The fact that he could have used it.
[477:13.78]And he did, but he didn't want to.
[477:15.12]I like that whole arc.
[477:17.68]The whole arc with Venom and Carnage is really interesting to me.
[477:22.74]Because there's not just two.
[477:25.02]There are a shitload of symbiotes.
[477:26.26]There are like at least four or five suits.
[477:28.50]Because there's a whole race of aliens.
[477:32.15]Didn't need the Wikipedia open for that one, did I?
[477:36.66]How did this even start?
[477:37.70]Oh, yeah, that's my favorite villain.
[477:40.78]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[477:41.96]Thank you, Divispy, for the $1.
[477:43.42]Thank you, Bet3, for the $2.
[477:45.82]Hi, Jerma.
[477:46.46]Hi, Bet3.
[477:52.01]I have not seen Into the Spider-Verse.
[477:53.41]I've heard it is unbelievable.
[477:55.17]So, can't wait.
[477:56.55]They're not a race of aliens.
[478:02.73]The Earth suits all split from Venom.
[478:05.73]There's a whole alien race of those symbiotes.
[478:11.23]Just because they were children of Venom, because he ate after midnight, doesn't mean there's not a whole planet full of them.
[478:32.52]Thank you, Tingy, for the $2.
[478:33.78]Thank you, Divispy, for another $2.
[478:35.17]Why are you doing this?
[478:36.39]I don't know.
[478:39.03]Why are you doing this?
[478:41.27]Thank you, Killcode, for the $1.
[478:44.49]Hey, Jerma, old clip time.
[478:46.01]Hope you enjoy.
[478:47.63]Don't dodge here.
[478:50.42]That's the one thing I remember about Blighttown.
[478:52.48]Do not dodge ever.
[478:55.32]Don't ever do it.
[478:56.98]You will regret it.
[479:08.08]I know a lot of people think that some of this shit is on purpose.
[479:13.22]Like I'm trying to bait reactions or something, or I'm doing it to try to play up something.
[479:22.49]No, that, I don't mean to, that didn't happen.
[479:35.54]Sometimes, of course, I do some of these things on purpose.
[479:39.58]But you all know when that is because we talk about them in real time.
[479:43.90]Or there's a joke that's being made.
[479:47.40]But stuff like that, that happens.
[479:52.54]What was the last time that that happened and I went on an actual meltdown about how people were going to think this was a joke and a lie and I was pretending?
[480:00.01]It was pretty recent.
[480:00.65]It was a couple of streams ago.
[480:01.77]What was it?
[480:09.40]The slap, yep, the slap.
[480:11.32]That's exactly, that's, yep.
[480:14.89]But how could, I read a thread, and somebody wrote, he literally did the most impossible, physically, mechanically impossible way to slap yourself.
[480:28.61]It has to be fake.
[480:31.39]It was something along those lines.
[480:39.57]I read it and I'm just like... I almost wish it was on purpose.
[480:46.91]Because then at least internally, it wouldn't be that embarrassing.
[480:55.67]I've never seen anyone do that, yeah?
[481:00.28]I just got too amped up and I got too into like the joke and I overestimated how far I had to go and I had to preview.
[481:09.53]Of all the things to turn the webcam on and do, hitting yourself in the fucking face.
[481:18.60]I still can't believe it.
[481:22.50]Fake slap.
[481:23.76]It's fake.
[481:28.24]Oh, and spilling and running into the buckets of water and viscera cleanup detail.
[481:33.43]None of those were fucking fake.
[481:34.49]They were all real.
[481:35.95]All of them.
[481:46.58]Jeremiah, I refuse to believe it's real.
[481:48.23]I tried to replicate what you did, and every time my hand refused to slap my face.
[481:54.35]But I... I don't... I was trying... Look.
[481:59.61]Here's the thought process here, and I'm going to try to explain this as best as I can.
[482:04.43]I did it twice, or three times, right?
[482:07.41]The first time, I was moving very slow, and it wasn't that funny because it wasn't fast.
[482:14.02]So, oh look, I'm trying to pretend that, oh, I missed you, and I had three stooges.
[482:18.02]But, in my mind, it wasn't as funny because my hand wasn't moving that fast.
[482:23.48]So, future me decided, I'm gonna move my hand really fucking fast, so when I have the slap noise play, it'll be...
[482:32.54]It'll be perfect and it'll actually look funny.
[482:40.19]I'm trying really hard to replicate it and I can't.
[482:42.15]Don't try to replicate.
[482:43.11]Don't try to slap yourself in the face.
[482:45.62]No, don't do that.
[482:46.82]Don't try this at home.
[482:49.86]Hey Sweat Knight, thanks for the $10, Sweat Knight.
[482:52.14]Hey Jerma, glad to see you're enjoying Dragon's Dogma so much, as it's one of my favorite RPG games despite all of its flaws.
[482:58.58]If you want another great game by the same director, I would strongly recommend Devil May Cry 3.
[483:04.99]Like Dark Souls, it often gets a bad rap for being extremely hard, but once you get into it, you'll see that it's a great game with some of the funnest combat and cutscenes in video game history.
[483:14.95]Not that difficult.
[483:16.53]Not that difficulty should be a problem for you.
[483:19.38]You god gamer.
[483:24.97]And then the new Devil May Cry is coming out.
[483:26.71]There's so many video games.
[483:33.25]Eventually there's going to be video game libraries.
[483:35.07]Because that's what happened with books.
[483:38.39]Think about that.
[483:39.49]Too many books were written.
[483:40.95]So they had to start to make giant buildings to put them in places.
[483:46.74]Back when there were like 40 books that were written.
[483:49.50]That didn't matter.
[483:50.84]Now we got entire gigantic structures to hold the shitload of books that have been written.
[483:56.15]That's gonna happen with- they're gonna be video game libraries.
[484:08.93]It's called the Internet.
[484:10.98]Yeah, but it'll be a card catalog.
[484:13.63]You go through G, G, God of War, Goddess, God of War 1, God of War 2, God of War 3, God of War 5, God of War... Attack of the Clones, God of War, and then in brackets, 2018.
[484:26.52]There's going to be 30 God of Wars there.
[484:43.77]Gears of War, Gears of War 2, Gears of War 3, Gears of War Mobile, Gears of War 4, Gears of War 5, Gears of War 6.
[484:48.73]You think they're gonna stop making Call of Duties?
[484:53.50]There'll be an entire military section of this library that in that catalog will be 250 Call of Duty slots.
[485:07.83]It's so weird to think about that because it's a joke now.
[485:10.87]Right?
[485:11.61]That's a joke now.
[485:13.19]Oh, they make a Call of Duty every fucking year.
[485:15.00]They're not going to stop doing that.
[485:17.04]For a very long time.
[485:19.70]Think of how many there are now.
[485:21.72]And think of how many there will be in a hundred years.
[485:28.16]What the hell is going to happen there?
[485:37.13]This is like your Olympics prediction, right?
[485:38.73]See you all in five years.
[485:41.42]Yeah.
[485:43.06]I got a lot of shit for that.
[485:46.14]Don't make me bring up the Olympics video, the video games at Olympics video.
[485:51.39]I was laughed out of town when I made that video.
[485:57.19]I was... all the top comments.
[485:59.69]It was just like, this is the dumbest thing I think you've ever said.
[486:02.39]Why the hell would this ever happen?
[486:03.85]Like, okay, you're really reaching for content here, and it's just like, oh, well, what do you know?
[486:09.04]Lickety-split.
[486:10.78]Here we are.
[486:22.28]Jerma smug.
[486:23.42]I will be smug on that one, because I remember being really sad...
[486:27.87]And being like, but that's, it could happen.
[486:30.21]This'll never happen, you idiot.
[486:33.66]But I'll be smug as I want with that one.
[486:44.52]The video has five and a half thousand upvotes and only 100 downvotes.
[486:47.88]Yeah, because I already talked about it on stream and a bunch of people went and made sure that they, you know, changed their history there.
[486:57.50]And then, you know, I said that comment about how he was like a dumb asshole.
[487:01.50]I gotta go back and like upvote the video and really like edit that comment.
[487:03.90]Hey man, like that's kind of, I thought about this too.
[487:05.88]I thought that that was like a good idea too when I thought about it like a few years ago.
[487:19.05]Jerma985, you're boring.
[487:20.57]Activate smart click map so we have something to do.
[487:26.59]Hey, we'll see you in five years when you think about what you just wrote right there and then you're going to go back and be like, oh, I probably shouldn't have said that.
[487:40.62]Anyways, thank you, Sweat Knight.
[487:42.10]Devil May Cry seems like a really awesome series.
[487:43.94]I've never played one second of any of the games.
[487:47.27]I'm sure you'll see it on stream eventually.
[487:50.87]Mostly lost thanks to the $1.00.
[487:53.39]Our character without facial hair is just... Trevor Lawrence.
[488:00.93]I don't... I mean, that... I don't think so.
[488:03.99]That's a very, very, very... It's not... No.
[488:09.49]I... Come on.
[488:14.67]They have, like, similar hair.
[488:23.52]I don't... I don't see it that much.
[488:25.84]It is... I don't see that.
[488:27.93]Maybe Trevor Lawrence is... weird fucked up grandfather or something.
[488:37.83]Hey, thank you Demonic Cucumber for the one dollar Thanos short comment.
[488:41.20]Comic.
[488:42.90]Thanos annual.
[488:50.84]Happy birthday from Thanos.
[489:01.15]It's just an older version of him.
[489:03.63]No, it's not.
[489:03.97]No, it's not.
[489:04.29]No, it's not.
[489:08.01]Thank you for the comic book.
[489:10.05]I'll add that to the Wikipedia page that was open the whole time.
[489:14.11]It was open the whole time!
[489:15.55]It was open the whole time and I got you guys good.
[489:27.38]We already knew.
[489:29.88]Well, one of you did.
[489:33.48]But Thanos is actually, no joke, probably one of my favorite current villains.
[489:39.37]Or superheroes, for all that matter.
[489:42.03]Thank you, Granko, for the $5.
[489:43.49]I missed the stream, but here are some bits anyways.
[489:46.33]If I watch the VOD later and it's bad, you will hear from my lawyers, sir.
[489:52.74]Don't get any lawyers.
[489:55.04]It ain't worth it.
[489:57.67]Hey Graveyard Ghoul, thanks for the $5.
[489:59.32]Hey Jerma, you're very cool.
[490:01.68]Thank you Graveyard Ghoul, I appreciate the $5 and that's a very nice thing to say to somebody.
[490:05.40]Thank you.
[490:07.10]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[490:08.40]Please give these bits to Shito.
[490:10.62]I will.
[490:12.56]Thank you Clueless Sniper for the $1.
[490:14.88]Shito will enjoy them.
[490:20.45]Hey Tingy, thanks for the $2 here.
[490:23.89]I wanted to see how long it would take you to notice me doing that.
[490:26.91]Went from $1 per stream to this today because it was taking too long.
[490:30.81]Oh, by the way, it took $6 for you to catch it.
[490:37.87]But what was there for me to... I was just reading your message.
[490:41.20]I knew what you were doing, but I just... I just was...
[490:46.16]I knew what you were doing.
[490:48.03]I have- Streamlabs has a who sent the bits.
[490:51.99]It's not like I could- couldn't tell who sent them.
[490:56.71]What fingers are your favorite least favorite?
[490:59.03]Uh... Index and thumb- no, middle finger and thumb are my favorite fingers.
[491:04.66]I hate ring finger.
[491:06.02]It sucks.
[491:06.88]It's stupid.
[491:08.18]They're always in a weird spot.
[491:09.70]It's hard to move them around.
[491:10.96]It's hard to maneuver them.
[491:11.88]They hurt sometimes trying to do certain tasks.
[491:20.07]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[491:21.49]I've always wondered, do you actually read comics?
[491:24.15]If so, what's your pull list?
[491:25.99]If you don't, I'd recommend the current Venom and Carnage runs.
[491:29.14]Also, Venom, which is Venom but set in the Vietnam War.
[491:33.26]That's really interesting.
[491:39.73]Uh...
[491:41.60]I mean, I have in the past, but all jokes aside, I don't currently read any.
[491:47.61]I think the last actual comic book that I opened was probably Civil War.
[491:51.85]That's probably the last one that I opened and looked at and was like, I'm gonna read this.
[491:59.13]See his clicks?
[491:59.91]I hear them.
[492:00.45]My hands are on my desk, folded like a fucking villain.
[492:10.42]Do I use old-school OBS?
[492:11.82]I do.
[492:12.12]I use OBS Studio.
[492:14.03]I don't use the Streamlabs one.
[492:20.41]You complained a lot about WWE 2K17, 18, 19.
[492:22.76]Why not for the next Rumble go back to 2K14?
[492:27.60]I've talked about a couple of the reasons why.
[492:29.06]Number one reason is because it just takes too long to load.
[492:32.84]Once you have 20, 30, 40 characters made in 2k14, and once you have 10, 20 plus layers on one character, it can take 30 to 40 seconds to load hair on somebody.
[492:46.27]It's just it doesn't hold up.
[492:49.31]If there was a 2k14 for PC,
[492:53.12]They decided in 2K15 forward to put him on PC.
[492:56.61]But that's the last one.
[492:57.77]That's the last really good creator.
[493:01.49]It just doesn't hold up.
[493:03.45]Old PlayStation 3 hardware, late generation PlayStation 3 game trying to just dump as much shit as they can.
[493:09.47]So, it just takes too long to make one character, especially if you want to do a lot of stuff to them.
[493:26.58]The creativity was nice.
[493:27.64]I know.
[493:28.82]And they got rid of the whole cinematic stuff where you could make your own little stories and have weird shit happen with characters.
[493:36.46]It really is too bad.
[493:38.59]It's too bad they made that a sports simulation game.
[493:42.51]Oh well.
[493:46.39]You should be able to emulate it.
[493:48.58]Emulating PlayStation 3 games is just so finicky.
[493:53.62]Half of them don't even work.
[493:56.12]It's really hard to do.
[493:58.16]Some of the emulators are better than others, but I've had so many problems trying to get past the PlayStation 1 era emulators to work even remotely correctly.
[494:13.26]We're not far enough into technology, I think, to be able to truly emulate, like, last-gen games.
[494:21.86]It's just, I don't think it's there yet.
[494:24.26]And it might not ever be.
[494:25.06]Because it's really easy to emulate the data that was on a cartridge.
[494:30.77]Stuff like Super Nintendo, Genesis, N64, they're all very emulatable.
[494:34.95]Even PlayStation 1, and into PlayStation 2, somewhat.
[494:40.41]ShaneSaw5, community subs!
[494:42.13]Thank you, ShaneSaw.
[494:48.39]Thank you so much.
[494:49.91]Five, community subs.
[494:52.50]RPCS3 has a lot of stuff working well at the moment.
[494:55.64]Give it another year and I bet it's amazing.
[494:58.58]I hope so.
[494:59.78]Because if I could use my powerful computer to render shit that's in a PlayStation 3 emulated version of 2K14, I would do it in a heartbeat.
[495:09.14]But it just doesn't work right now.
[495:16.32]But thank you so much, ShaneSaw.
[495:19.64]Getting close to almost at the end of the bits.
[495:21.52]Only a few more left.
[495:23.84]Thank you to Demonic Cucumber for the $1 spill joke.
[495:29.04]Chainsaw's still going.
[495:35.96]Was that delayed from earlier?
[495:37.12]No.
[495:37.78]Chainsaw's gifting five.
[495:39.42]No, that's... Okay, there it is.
[495:40.52]It just showed up.
[495:41.70]Just got delayed for some reason.
[495:43.24]Weird.
[495:44.08]But thank you so much.
[495:46.20]Demonic Cucumber says, spill joke, and then they link a link.
[495:52.53]That was a great short.
[495:59.37]Hey, George Maka, thanks for the $1.
[496:02.30]Four days left, Jerma.
[496:03.30]Can I have your intellectual shares of clown in the town when you're gone?
[496:06.74]Just joshing.
[496:07.44]Loved you since the GTA 4 vids with Ster.
[496:09.28]You're the best.
[496:12.99]Thank you so much, George.
[496:14.51]And thank you, CairoToby.
[496:15.91]Oh, and GreatCanadian.
[496:18.11]Just kind of comes out of nowhere.
[496:20.81]With five more.
[496:21.63]CairoToby, five.
[496:23.10]GreatCanadianFuckClub, five.
[496:26.24]Community subs each.
[496:27.18]Thank you, guys.
[496:31.40]Am I going to stream Resident Evil 2?
[496:32.58]Absolutely.
[496:33.76]I'll probably do it within a day or so of it launching.
[496:38.25]Thanks to the both of you.
[496:40.98]And finally here we've got Fitty for $2.
[496:44.38]Fitty, thanks for the dollar.
[496:45.46]Hey, Fitty, thanks for the 100 bits.
[496:46.80]Thank you, Fitty, for the $1.
[496:49.92]Thank you, Fitty, for the $1.
[496:51.06]And then $1 again.
[496:54.85]$2.
[496:55.19]Thank you.
[496:58.13]Yeah, thank you, Fitty, for the $1.
[496:59.37]Yeah, I'll just order a pizza.
[497:01.81]Wait, what the hell?
[497:02.33]Jerm is reading through my live thoughts on stream.
[497:05.41]Oh, God, please stop.
[497:08.93]Those two hurt my brain to read them.
[497:12.75]What is this delay?
[497:13.78]I don't know.
[497:14.16]Maybe it's... I don't know.
[497:17.46]That's really weird.
[497:19.96]I jumbled the message up because, yeah, because I read them both kind of at the same time.
[497:25.56]Hey, talking about subs.
[497:26.96]A shitload of community subs are coming tonight.
[497:30.81]Why don't we take a look and see the people that subscribed or were given a sub?
[497:41.64]Jeremy's going to keep saying your name as Fuck Club.
[497:45.32]The Great Canadian FK Club.
[497:47.70]But what is it?
[497:53.43]It's Frick Club?
[497:58.29]Great Canadian Frick Club.
[498:06.20]What?
[498:09.52]That is not what it is.
[498:17.61]My mom is listening to me.
[498:18.87]What the frick?
[498:25.66]What if I just say Great Canadian Club?
[498:36.42]But Dragon's Dogma is a lot of fun.
[498:38.63]I'm not sure the plan tomorrow because there are so many options that I almost don't know what I'm going to do.
[498:48.86]It really depends on what, because there are some things that are planned on coming in for delivery tomorrow.
[498:59.51]You can also just play this too.
[499:05.44]Dark Souls 3, the mods look like a lot of fun.
[499:08.38]One of them in particular I thought was really funny.
[499:11.04]There's a mod for Dark Souls 3 that randomizes the speed of the game.
[499:16.82]So it can go in slow motion up to fast forward speed.
[499:26.49]That sounds like actual hell.
[499:28.23]Yeah.
[499:29.69]Sounds like fun though.
[499:32.27]There's one where you can play as the enemies too.
[499:34.33]That's probably good.
[499:35.25]I have to check them out.
[499:37.09]That's gonna be at least a couple streams.
[499:38.78]It has to be.
[499:42.44]So basically you got multiple options here.
[499:47.35]Please do that tomorrow.
[499:51.83]If I can get it to work, that's gonna take a little bit of work though, because with any mod or total complete scripting or game-changing mods, there's a tendency for them to take a lot of troubleshooting.
[500:02.95]So I'm gonna have to spend some time tomorrow hopefully doing that.
[500:11.47]What's gonna be the January 23rd stream?
[500:13.53]January 23rd stream is gonna be an IRL hangout stream where I wear a full goalie outfit and like duct tape my door closed.
[500:22.44]That stream's only going to be like an hour.
[500:28.68]No, not because I'm gonna... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[500:34.88]I will stream January 23rd until 12.01.
[500:40.94]But I don't think I'm going to start that stream at like 4 p.m.
[500:45.18]That's going to be like a late night stream.
[500:50.31]So I'm gonna start that stream at some point in like the late afternoon.
[500:55.97]And then we're gonna just kind of hang out in final destination, my room.
[501:01.37]It said that- it said it- oh shit!
[501:05.61]Okay, alright, never mind.
[501:06.71]So it's 723 p.m.
[501:08.01]Eastern or Pacific?
[501:15.17]Was that- what time zone was that?
[501:19.94]It was Eastern, okay.
[501:23.76]So that means that at 3.23 p.m.
[501:28.96]Okay, so I will start that stream at 3 o'clock.
[501:32.54]Or 2.30.
[501:34.54]And we're gonna hang out.
[501:35.34]I was gonna get like bug spray and like spray it around, but I don't know if I want to make my room smell like that.
[501:53.15]But anyways, that's going to be it.
[501:54.57]Thank you, everybody, for your insane amount of support, as always.
[501:59.60]See you tomorrow.
[502:03.36]He's going to inhale the bug spray.
[502:05.36]And that... No.
[502:06.22]Alright.
[502:06.86]I'm going to duct tape my door.
[502:10.46]765... Yeah, actually, it would be 4.
[502:12.66]It'd be 423.
[502:14.02]So I'll start that stream at, like, 334.
[502:17.12]With my, like, goalie outfit on.
[502:21.89]Being naked, it'll be safer.
[502:23.09]No, I need, like, pads.
[502:24.97]What if, like, the roof falls down?
[502:27.17]I'll be in, like, full hockey gear and I will not be affected.
[502:40.84]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[502:42.10]Have a great night.
[502:43.20]Thanks for watching.
[502:45.06]Hopefully we see you soon.
[502:47.08]Take care.
[502:49.35]Ta-ta for now.
