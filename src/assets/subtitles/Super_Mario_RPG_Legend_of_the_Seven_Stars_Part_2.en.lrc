[00:21.91]Yeah.
[00:23.87]Yeah, my number is one number off of your number.
[00:28.56]Okay, cool.
[00:31.25]That's really great.
[00:32.73]That makes me happy.
[00:35.41]Okay, please never call me again.
[00:37.91]Goodbye.
[00:39.65]Great.
[00:40.19]That was fun.
[00:41.65]It's 7 o'clock in the fucking morning.
[00:52.36]You guys never heard of that?
[00:57.44]I know it's not- I was doing a bit- I was doing a routine!
[01:03.65]There was a big spotlight on me.
[01:05.59]And I had the mic in my hand.
[01:07.51]And the house lights are down.
[01:09.67]Spotlight.
[01:10.11]Bang!
[01:10.49]I go into my bit.
[01:11.25]My performance.
[01:13.31]No clapping.
[01:14.21]No clapping.
[01:16.91]House lights come down.
[01:18.84]Bang!
[01:19.10]Spotlight.
[01:19.50]Here we go.
[01:19.90]I'm going.
[01:21.48]Oh, let's clap.
[01:22.50]I can't.
[01:22.92]I'm not clapping.
[01:23.70]No, he's just going.
[01:24.72]Okay.
[01:27.74]See what I mean?
[01:33.68]Let's go.
[01:36.10]Alright, hi.
[01:37.28]Get it back on.
[01:37.84]Get it back on.
[01:38.30]I'm not ready yet.
[01:39.46]You can clap.
[01:42.24]You can clap.
[01:44.32]So, today we're going to do Mario RPG again.
[01:49.81]We're going to do Terraria tonight, but Star and I could not sync up good...
[02:00.89]We had our days mixed up apparently Thought we were doing it Monday apparently we had that wrong.
[02:06.60]I guess I thought I thought I said Monday, but whatever it's alright It's all good So we're going to do that probably different day or Terraria is kind of just cursed so Seems like every time something happens
[02:23.79]Like, Star's computer breaks, like, three weeks ago.
[02:27.02]And then two weeks ago, my internet, like, doesn't work.
[02:30.56]At all.
[02:32.28]And then we mix our days up this time.
[02:37.92]Let's just pretend we beat the moon boss.
[02:43.65]There he is.
[02:44.13]Is he here?
[02:47.19]I thought it was a different day.
[02:48.41]No, it's fine.
[02:49.03]It don't matter.
[02:52.52]I mean, I did clearly, if you scroll up in the PMs, I did clearly say Monday.
[02:57.05]I don't know if you scroll up in those PMs.
[03:06.15]He's fucking so mad right now.
[03:08.17]No.
[03:09.19]It's all good.
[03:09.67]Terraria is just a relaxing, fun game to play anyways.
[03:11.91]It's not a big deal.
[03:16.43]Here comes another year-long joke.
[03:22.02]Release the email.
[03:24.79]No.
[03:25.81]It's all good.
[03:28.15]But, so, what we're going to do is, just because we couldn't... I wanted to start around, like, 3.34.
[03:32.69]So, I didn't want to have another scenario where it's like, oh, let's set a 30-minute, 40-minute setup time, because Terraria multiplayer fucking doesn't work half the time.
[03:45.26]But, we love Star.
[03:48.37]We do.
[03:51.67]But we also love Super Mario as well.
[03:56.53]We'll do something someday.
[03:58.53]Maybe tomorrow.
[03:59.17]No, not tomorrow.
[03:59.79]Maybe like... Next weekend!
[04:01.55]You know what we should start?
[04:04.10]You know what we should actually do?
[04:06.04]We should... Just get to the end.
[04:09.74]Of Terraria.
[04:10.64]And just turn the stream on.
[04:11.96]And have the last base game boss have one HP left.
[04:16.68]And then just be like... Like fucking screaming and stuff that we did it.
[04:20.05]And then just move on to our own game.
[04:27.56]And then end the streams.
[04:29.88]Oh my god.
[04:31.01]Anyways.
[04:31.33]We're going to pick up where we left off yesterday on Super Mario RPG.
[04:35.13]Legend of the Seven Stars.
[04:36.63]I got voices.
[04:38.59]The throat is voiced.
[04:39.71]My throat is lubricated.
[04:41.13]It's well rested.
[04:44.83]He's starting his tuber voice.
[04:46.03]That's how you know it's ready to start the Let's Play continuation.
[04:51.12]We have five of them.
[04:52.90]And they're distinct.
[04:54.88]I'll prove it to you.
[05:00.72]Uh-oh.
[05:07.90]That's four.
[05:08.42]Hold on.
[05:11.62]This one.
[05:13.74]This one.
[05:15.23]This one.
[05:16.83]This one.
[05:22.43]And this one.
[05:24.07]There you go.
[05:24.41]You got five distinct voices.
[05:26.13]Told you.
[05:38.05]Alright, so we left off.
[05:38.95]We got the princess.
[05:40.73]Princess joined the party.
[05:45.97]We now have to go unravel the mysteries of... I don't know.
[05:54.48]I've played this game a thousand times.
[05:55.68]I don't fucking remember what happens next.
[05:57.74]Alright, we go through to Marymoor.
[06:01.17]We go to Booster's Pass, first of all.
[06:02.95]Because something happened here last time.
[06:07.86]You can't do the Mallow voice because you don't use Mallow.
[06:11.64]Yes, I can.
[06:12.53]I didn't say five distinct currently on-camera voices.
[06:15.19]I just said just five distinct voices.
[06:18.15]Oops, I fell down.
[06:30.99]We want Mallow.
[06:32.55]Well, Mallow's not in the... You know what?
[06:35.01]For the first time ever, I may replace Geno.
[06:40.47]It's possible.
[06:41.19]I don't know.
[06:41.99]I haven't decided yet.
[06:45.07]Here we go.
[06:45.77]Come on, let's bring out a sixth.
[06:49.82]Golly, you're that famous Mario... Nope.
[06:53.14]Golly, you're that famous Mario guy.
[06:55.88]If I beat you, they'll make me Sniffit number four.
[06:58.38]If I'm lucky...
[07:01.35]There we go.
[07:05.99]You ain't gonna be Sniffit number four.
[07:08.43]You're gonna be in Sniffit number six feet under.
[07:22.69]What?
[07:23.63]Oh, now they'll make me take the training course over again.
[07:25.83]Yoo-hoo-ee!
[07:38.36]Flower tab.
[07:41.10]Frog coin.
[07:43.54]Karo Karo Cola.
[07:47.47]Got it.
[07:48.31]I got the sacred.
[07:49.27]I got the sacred.
[07:51.53]Uh oh.
[07:53.99]Mario just fell off the face of the earth.
[07:55.39]Alright, let's go.
[07:55.93]I think there's something else you can do here.
[08:01.39]There's something else on Booster's path that I don't want to miss.
[08:04.54]It is like a training course, but is it over here?
[08:07.40]Where is it?
[08:13.00]Because it's that way, but I can't keep going that way.
[08:17.28]I forget where it is.
[08:18.08]You have to scale a mountain.
[08:22.50]Let me check that over here one more time.
[08:25.92]Let me fall off the other side.
[08:36.11]like this no hey germ I was watching your last stream could you maybe cut back on the haha entertainer joke please laugh jokes please then you what haha entertainer jokes laugh please laugh jokes what the does that mean
[09:05.91]I don't even know what that means.

[09:19.50]Alright, what was the la- we have to go to- I- what the fuck was the last thing I just did?
[09:23.46]Let me try to remember.
[09:30.34]We- we got the princess.
[09:32.08]Oh, we got- we got to talk to, um, the frog fuchsias.
[09:34.32]Okay.
[09:39.10]Oh, let me check from Frog Coins.
[09:42.12]May I help you?
[09:42.52]Uh, no.
[09:50.40]Where's the Frog Coin guy?
[09:51.76]Welcome to the Frog Coin Emporium!
[09:54.22]I got 15 Frog Coins.
[09:55.34]I'm not going to use any of these.
[09:56.28]Because you can get accessories later that are really, really good.
[10:00.18]Hold on, let's see if Todovsky has anything.
[10:06.62]My favorite song?
[10:07.80]It's the Moldville Minors song.
[10:09.26]Ooh!
[10:10.20]Mi Do So... I have a picture of this on my phone.
[10:19.50]I'm gonna get the next layer of card.
[10:23.66]Mi Do So Do Re La Ti Do.
[10:28.80]Alright, let's get that up.
[10:29.66]Where is it?
[10:34.33]Remind Chat of Sub-Tember.
[10:38.41]What is that?
[10:38.93]What the hell is September?
[10:39.79]I have to take a photo of this.
[10:45.58]Mi do so do... Hold on.
[10:50.62]Mi do... Whatever that is, this is... To me, this is... The mi do so do re la ti do is more important.
[10:55.82]Hold on.
[10:56.58]Mi do so do re la ti do.
[11:05.64]When are you ever going to do an experimental no-talking stream?
[11:11.70]A hundred of you would watch that.
[11:12.88]I'm not going to do that.
[11:13.74]All right.
[11:14.90]Mido, Sodo, Re, La, Ti, Do.
[11:16.66]Got it?
[11:17.78]And then I have the image there.
[11:18.86]Let's do it.
[11:21.40]Sub.
[11:21.70]Okay.
[11:21.92]Subtember.
[11:22.90]It's half off of all subs.
[11:26.15]Really?
[11:28.25]Oh.
[11:28.71]All right.
[11:28.99]Okay.
[11:29.11]What do you mean half off?
[11:37.86]How does that make sense?
[11:39.53]What the fuck was that?
[11:45.97]What the hell was that?
[11:46.61]My phone just, like, did a different noise.
[11:47.93]It's never done this noise.
[11:48.81]Alright, no, that's good.
[12:02.42]Alright, so you want a music lesson from me?
[12:04.08]No, I don't.
[12:05.04]Alright, I got it.
[12:05.66]Oh no, I'm supposed to keep my phone open!
[12:09.43]Did my phone overheat because I had the image on for too long?
[12:13.80]This is the third year it's happened.
[12:14.92]How do you not know this?
[12:16.40]I don't know, because it's only like one month out of a year, three times.
[12:20.16]This has only happened three times.
[12:21.94]Look.
[12:23.98]Mi, do, so, do, re, la, ti, do is more important.
[12:27.54]Please laugh at that.
[12:28.30]Alright, we need mi.
[12:35.35]Do, re, mi is the last one.
[12:40.56]Okay, mi, do, which is right in the middle.
[12:46.22]Mi, do, so.
[12:47.16]So it's do, do, ti, la, so, fa.

[12:55.93]Re.
[13:05.54]la so that's do ti la so fa do ti la do do ti do all right is it what do you think todovsky I did a pretty good job I think
[13:34.92]Hey man, did you have a mental breakdown?
[13:36.10]A long time ago you said you'd only play this on stream if you had a mental breakdown.
[13:39.10]Did I actually say that?
[13:49.51]I got a tenor card.
[13:50.43]Wait, why did I say that?
[13:55.11]I said I would only play this game if I had a mental breakdown on stream?
[14:07.53]Well, yeah, you can count Simpsons hit and run.
[14:10.25]That makes sense.
[14:10.75]Yeah, nothing wrong with that.
[14:14.83]Alright, I got my card.
[14:16.77]We have the next level of, uh... stolen music from this guy.
[14:27.56]Mario Tennis counts.
[14:29.12]No, I'm okay with that.
[14:32.30]Hmm, a tenor card holder, huh?
[14:34.40]What'll it be?
[14:36.59]Ooh, we get mega elixirs now.
[14:41.34]The whole party recovers 150.
[14:42.18]That's a lot of money.
[14:49.39]Alright, let's go talk to Frogfuscious.
[14:52.37]I'm ready for one of my distinct voices.
[15:03.24]I have the latest news, children.
[15:05.81]A large star has been sighted on Star Hill.
[15:12.61]In other news, the sky is fucking blue.
[15:18.09]Why are you coming to me?
[15:22.96]Sorry, Grandpa.
[15:43.22]Here we go, Star Hill.
[15:48.73]This place is cool.
[15:53.45]I get a lot of claymation vibes from this place.
[15:56.11]I don't know why.
[15:59.18]To marry more, and then talk to the flower, and the flower... If you talk to the flower, a gate will open.
[16:03.84]This one is to Star Hill.
[16:10.93]Here we go.
[16:16.51]I still haven't figured out how I want him to sound.
[16:19.97]I have to figure it out now.
[16:21.25]Because we're getting to the top of the roller coaster here.
[16:26.57]This... This is Star Hill.
[16:30.52]No.
[16:31.40]Watch out for the lizard behind you.
[16:32.66]Behind you!
[16:35.70]This is Star Hill.
[16:37.70]No, that sounds terrible.
[16:39.48]This is Star Hill.
[16:40.78]No.
[16:42.50]This is Star Hill.
[16:44.10]No.
[16:52.58]This is Star Hill.
[16:53.98]No.
[16:55.65]This.
[16:55.85]This.
[16:56.25]This.
[16:57.53]This.
[17:01.07]This is Star Hill.
[17:02.97]Wishes which were transformed at the Star Road fall from here.
[17:07.25]But, some wishes that haven't been granted yet are falling because Smitty destroyed the Star Road.
[17:17.10]I have to do the anime voice.
[17:18.32]What else am I supposed to do?
[17:19.24]Frog Precious mentioned hearing about her stories on this hill.
[17:29.24]Let's see if we can find it.
[17:31.86]I'm combining them all for that character.
[17:34.06]You're getting all five in that character alone.
[17:43.74]Oh, it's Otto.
[17:49.24]No, I don't want to hurt Otto.
[17:50.62]Just these things.
[17:56.00]Migraine.
[17:58.92]I think Migraine is an instant kill.
[18:08.79]Just do text-to-speech.
[18:12.71]That's not... Alright.
[18:13.75]That... Why do we have to... That did one damage, and I didn't even block it.
[18:20.94]That's not very nice.
[18:27.06]These little guys, though, I do want to attack, because I think they give you stuff.
[18:29.88]They drop stuff.
[18:31.95]I said the same thing twice.
[18:35.92]There we are.
[18:36.36]I think I actually kind of like this Regina.
[18:37.80]Yeah.
[18:39.14]I'm gonna stick with this one.
[18:47.23]No!
[18:48.85]Don't let him run!
[18:56.86]Don't let him get away.
[18:57.60]These guys drop items.
[19:05.67]30 bucks.
[19:06.09]That's what I'm talking about.
[19:08.48]Go all the way around.
[19:19.44]Touch this one.
[19:24.92]What about the little star?
[19:25.96]Look at that emote.
[19:27.44]That is such a cute little emote, isn't it?
[19:30.01]If I could just get that melody.
[19:39.73]If you could just get the melody.
[19:44.33]The hunger.
[19:45.87]Oh, for some food!
[19:46.93]That's kinda creepy.
[19:54.88]What do stars eat?
[19:59.16]I want to be a Vald Klaas baker.
[20:05.33]Have you figured it out yet?
[20:07.51]Have you figured it out yet, Klaas?
[20:17.00]I want to be the best treasure hunter in the world!
[20:22.84]Yes, these are wishes from the people down below.
[20:26.33]Did it really take... Come on.
[20:37.10]I figured it out.
[20:39.84]I got it.
[20:48.39]I want to be best treasure.
[20:51.55]Who's the best?
[20:52.01]Who is that?
[20:52.49]I'm not even sure who that's supposed to be.
[20:58.76]I wonder what character that is.
[21:02.96]The hunger.
[21:03.50]That's probably... That's Baelon?
[21:07.16]What's my wish?
[21:12.29]I can't tell you, because then it won't come true.
[21:15.27]Where's this other stupid flower?
[21:23.89]There it is.
[21:26.27]Please let Mallow find his way home.
[21:29.73]Why, this wish is... Wait, uh-uh.
[21:32.45]Why, this wish is... It's from my mom and dad.
[21:39.38]They're wishing for me to come home.
[21:40.90]This is not the time to be crying.
[21:52.21]They're waiting for me to come home.
[21:55.40]Come on, Mario.
[21:56.74]We got a busy schedule.
[21:58.58]I'll make you eat dust if you don't hurry.
[22:03.20]What?
[22:05.91]Is that what he said?
[22:07.05]What did he say?
[22:09.79]Did I say that wrong?
[22:15.35]Is dust like dirt?
[22:18.50]Like berry?
[22:23.47]I'm gonna make you eat dust.
[22:31.94]Who's this one?
[22:33.72]Wish I could run faster.
[22:34.90]I hope I become famous.
[22:42.91]It's mine!
[22:45.49]Shh, don't tell anybody!
[22:59.60]See, the one problem with Mario... This is the only issue that most people have with this game.
[23:04.60]Is this is just a free star.
[23:09.63]You don't have to do anything to get it.
[23:12.07]This is kind of the padding.
[23:13.33]This is the filler episode of this game.
[23:21.03]It is a cool stage, though.
[23:21.95]Yeah, it is.
[23:28.62]Hey, look at that.
[23:29.16]Only three more to go.
[23:38.88]And one could say this is the end of the Marymoor arc.
[23:45.70]You've come a long way, but your journey is not over.
[23:47.64]There are three more star pieces.
[23:54.93]We're good.
[24:00.02]I want to be a great plumber like my brother Mario.
[24:12.99]Luigi, I'm sorry, but you'll never be as good as me.
[24:17.73]You'll always be second best.
[24:29.05]I'm just being realistic with it.
[24:30.85]You know, come on.
[24:34.55]Luigi, how many games have you had?
[24:37.01]One?
[24:37.81]Two?
[24:38.93]I've had like 38.
[24:39.77]You need to have 36 more games under your belt before you're gonna be able to fix the toilets like I can.
[24:54.40]What's going on here?
[24:58.15]Apologize, I'm sorry Luigi.
[25:01.75]There.
[25:11.18]That's a family guy joke?
[25:17.32]How is that a family guy joke?
[25:26.71]I'm just a customer.
[25:29.15]Don't tell me you want supplies, I know.
[25:41.15]Wait, I made fun of Luigi, therefore I was a family guy joke?
[25:48.02]No.
[25:48.94]I didn't know how the rules were, I'm sorry.
[25:50.12]Alright, bad mush poisons an enemy.
[25:53.72]Uh, a mooku cookie.
[26:00.45]Fright Bomb, Fire Bomb, and Ice Bomb.
[26:04.83]These are really good, but they're way too expensive.
[26:13.60]Ice Bomb is crazy.
[26:15.36]I think it does, like, over 200 or 300 damage.
[26:20.70]I don't know what this does.
[26:25.33]You owe us a Peter.
[26:26.55]No, I don't.
[26:27.75]At all, actually.
[26:28.39]So...
[26:31.69]Thank you very much.
[26:41.34]In the middle of the ocean is a pirate ship.
[26:45.70]You'll find... I mean there's... A pirate lives there.
[26:52.86]His name is Jonathan Jones.
[26:56.12]He isn't very nice.
[27:02.65]A star has fallen into the sea.
[27:05.89]The pirate probably.
[27:11.88]I mean that man, Jonathan Jones, probably has it.
[27:16.46]He's nasty.
[27:32.20]This is the inn.
[27:34.58]You may stay for free.
[27:39.88]Thanks.
[27:42.06]Okay.
[27:57.89]Scared.
[28:08.68]check your money you may stay for free I'll pass okay wait this already waited this one already
[28:39.05]It's like a cat.
[28:41.53]Come here.
[28:44.83]You're collecting stars, right?
[28:47.51]Only three more to go.
[29:00.57]If you want to enter the ocean, jump into the whirlpools.
[29:10.22]You will find the village elder in his house.
[29:14.12]He is the most respected person here.
[29:32.95]They came spinning and spinning.
[30:03.29]Finally.
[30:05.12]It took you long enough.
[30:07.42]I am the elder of this village.
[30:10.52]I got to my exalted station in life by pleasing my superiors, which is something I do well.
[30:19.30]A star has fallen into the ocean.
[30:21.23]I need it for a certain purpose.
[30:26.93]You must find it for me.
[30:32.59]You'll find the star in Jonathan Jones' territory.
[30:36.57]Don't worry, you can beat him.
[30:41.24]At least I think you can.
[30:43.20]Hurry and bring back the star.
[30:55.75]Hello there.
[30:57.01]You're Mario, right?
[30:58.81]You remember me?
[30:59.75]We met at Tadpole Pond, when I was still a tadpole.
[31:03.51]I graduated from Frogfuscious' school, and now I'm searching for the meaning of life.
[31:09.28]It's been so quiet around here, and it's almost eerie.
[31:13.72]Is something going on?
[31:16.43]It probably doesn't concern me, but if you got any frog coins, I've got some neat items to sell you.
[31:23.97]There we go.
[31:35.07]Doubles experience when equipped.
[31:38.15]Doubles the coins you win in battle.
[31:40.25]And cuts FP use in half during a fight.
[31:45.14]This also is... You can use this to start a fight over.
[31:48.06]Or allows you to always run away from a battle.
[31:52.81]This one is awesome.
[31:54.99]This one is probably... This is probably the best ring in the game.
[31:59.79]But it's 50 frog coins.
[32:04.51]Realistically, I could probably get one of these.
[32:10.31]I definitely don't want to do this, though.
[32:15.48]Go farm the Midas River.
[32:16.90]I could.
[32:18.26]But I don't think I'm going to do that.
[32:21.22]It's a cool character, though.
[32:26.30]Be careful up here, by the way.
[32:27.64]Do you have a stick or something?
[32:29.81]Can I give you a symbol?
[32:32.35]These people out here are dangerous.
[32:33.57]Look at them.
[32:39.86]I think I can get in there eventually.
[32:47.72]Alright, I think I'm good.
[32:51.44]I have the latest equipment.
[32:53.52]What do I have for items?
[32:57.32]I have too many honey syrups.
[33:00.72]Alright, I'm gonna use these as well.
[33:02.64]Alright, I gotta do some... I have to get rid of this shit.
[33:07.12]I need some mushrooms.
[33:08.69]How many mushrooms do I have?
[33:09.61]I need more stuff.
[33:10.33]Hold on.
[33:10.61]I'm gonna have to go to another town and get some stuff, because these guys won't sell me shit.
[33:25.56]I do have so much stuff, but I just need to get rid of it.
[33:29.61]No, who sells?
[33:30.17]You?
[33:30.69]No.
[33:30.95]Who sells?
[33:31.41]You sell.
[33:37.45]Oh, bad mushroom.
[33:38.57]No, I have to go to a different town.
[33:46.41]There was a Super Mario manga for a bit.
[33:51.89]Was there really?
[33:52.45]That seems weird.
[34:00.10]Alright, let's get some stuff.
[34:05.36]Uh, Womp Glove.
[34:05.98]We already have everything that's the best.
[34:08.20]I need some mid-mushrooms, though.
[34:11.39]And I'm gonna sell... I have to sell them.
[34:12.81]They're taking up so much stupid space.
[34:16.05]Honey Syrups are just dog shit now.
[34:20.55]I could get... Look at how much you could get for that.
[34:23.78]Lucky Jewel.
[34:24.50]I know I could use that and I could...
[34:34.84]I had to.
[34:38.61]These... These are oh shit panic buttons.
[34:41.85]I still have a Yoshi cookie.
[34:42.85]Alright, I'm gonna get another... I'm gonna get a maple syrup.
[34:48.15]Yeah, two maple syrups.
[34:49.17]That sounds good to me.
[34:52.63]Whatever happens, happens.
[34:54.25]I should be fine.
[35:02.13]Let's go to the sea.
[35:07.58]It is time to go find the star that's apparently down here.
[35:14.78]Oh, there he is.
[35:15.48]It's been a while since people came round here.
[35:26.39]Oh, fuck!
[35:29.27]Look at all this- I don't have any money!
[35:33.55]Super Hammer, Hurly Gloves, Handgun I already have.
[35:38.99]Oh, no!
[35:45.84]How much can I get if I take off?
[35:47.46]Hold on.
[35:54.72]Alright.
[35:56.03]If I... If I get rid of the Happy Shirt, get rid of the Happy Cape...
[36:02.97]Keep the amulet.
[36:04.01]The work pants are always good.
[36:07.23]What if I get rid of the jump shoes?
[36:10.41]Alright, I'm gonna sell those two and see if I can afford anything.
[36:13.49]I'll be able to come back and afford it later.
[36:19.40]Happy shirt.
[36:20.18]Happy cape.
[36:21.94]Buy.
[36:24.00]Sailor shirt.
[36:24.88]Sailor cape.
[36:25.56]Alright, we can get Mario's shirt.
[36:32.88]And I'm going to have to come back for Gino's shirt.
[36:38.65]The ship sank into the briny sea because a giant squid attacked it.
[36:42.65]Some people went in to survey it.
[36:44.93]But they never came back.
[36:47.79]Weird.
[36:52.76]Sailor shirt.
[36:53.18]Alright, you'll be fine.
[36:58.20]Giant octopus.
[36:59.40]Never came back.
[37:02.44]Alright.
[37:03.26]I'll come back.
[37:08.06]This is... I believe there is a star right here.
[37:11.81]So I've got to be ready for this.
[37:12.99]Got it.
[37:14.83]More, more, more, more, more!
[37:16.39]Ooh!
[37:17.07]Myra is level 9.
[37:34.00]You know what to do.
[37:35.04]This is in your hands.
[37:43.57]Please click on the screen where you'd like me to put the points in.
[37:49.55]Have fun with it.
[37:51.31]Power, power, power, power, power!
[38:15.68]Okay.
[38:17.22]I think that's all I need to see.
[38:23.07]Power it is.
[38:26.97]55 to 57, and then 27 to 28 defense.
[38:28.63]What am I getting at?
[38:34.89]We got another one.
[38:35.41]Geno.
[38:37.55]Geno got a good HP increase.
[38:39.91]Yeah, very good.
[38:40.73]Pretty much across the board, everything.
[38:48.25]Alright guys, that's it for tonight.
[38:55.40]I'll see you tomorrow where I pick up at 42 minutes and 12 seconds.
[38:57.34]That's funny.
[39:16.76]Alright, uh, we're going with magic.
[39:27.59]40, 41, 24, 25.
[39:28.09]Anybody else?
[39:28.95]Wow, I think the whole, uh, the whole entire group leveled up, I believe.
[39:37.41]Malo's creeping up on Geno.
[39:39.55]But look at his HP, it's terrible.
[39:41.83]He'll get one hit killed in half the encounters late game.
[39:57.57]Potentially a decent choice.
[40:05.52]I do love the dancing flowers, though.
[40:11.10]What's the actual meta for this game?
[40:12.86]I have no idea.
[40:14.20]Not a single clue.
[40:22.26]Guys, I just press buttons.
[40:23.28]I don't know what they do.
[40:25.22]I'm actually surprised I've been able to do this with my eyes closed for this long.
[40:30.74]Toadstool has reached level 10.
[40:33.00]Look at that magic.
[40:44.00]Gino, Toadstool, and Mallow, I believe, have the highest damage for magic.
[40:52.45]Why am I not playing Classic WoW?
[40:53.59]I have Warfra- I have Warf- I have Reference, not Warfrence.
[40:57.97]I have Reference Warcraft every stream.
[41:06.97]Um... Cuz I- I don't know.
[41:12.17]I'm not playing it.
[41:14.81]Maybe I will.
[41:15.46]Guys, you never go to the new attraction the day it opens.
[41:24.47]I don't want to wait in line for four hours to ride the new Galaxy's Edge ride.
[41:30.86]I'm gonna go when everybody doesn't give a shit anymore and I can stay in the hotel for fucking three nights for the same price as one night right now.
[41:42.44]Thank you for voting.
[41:42.99]45 and 31.
[41:53.87]You're going to stay in the hotel when it's not cool anymore.
[42:03.66]Yeah, what do you mean it's not cool anymore?
[42:05.06]It's cool to like me, my two sons, my wife, and my grandfather.
[42:12.42]I don't care.
[42:13.01]I don't give a shit how cool it is.
[42:15.97]It's cool to us.
[42:16.67]Found the secret room, by the way.
[42:27.30]Hold on.
[42:28.16]Important.
[42:28.90]I'm about to get destroyed.
[42:35.88]I do.
[42:36.71]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[42:38.31]What did I do?
[42:38.77]What did I do?
[42:39.23]What did I do?
[42:41.35]No, shit.
[42:45.11]I got baited.
[42:45.97]I got baited.
[42:47.09]I wasn't supposed to do this.
[42:48.77]No.
[42:51.46]I just saved it right here.
[42:52.62]It's the only save I have.
[43:04.90]How much money did I make?
[43:10.87]Not enough.
[43:11.25]Fuck.
[43:15.35]Thank you, drop by again.
[43:16.33]Alright, that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.
[43:23.44]In fact, that was not a big deal at all.
[43:25.08]I just overreacted.
[43:27.26]I reacted harder for you, okay?
[43:29.37]That was a lot of reactions.
[43:31.41]The reason why I did that is because over here, there is one of these things that, never mind, I had it incorrect.
[43:40.14]I was wrong, and I will stand by my correction that I thought it was a different part of the game.
[43:45.99]It was just some free stuff, and that's it.
[43:58.97]But I want to get up there.
[44:01.05]I know you can get sucked up there somehow.
[44:08.43]I didn't want to do that either.
[44:09.24]Yes, I did.
[44:15.60]I want to come up.
[44:21.12]Got a max mushroom.
[44:23.49]Let's get rid of one of our honey syrups.
[44:26.57]Because these things are stupid.
[44:34.43]Should I fight it?
[44:37.55]Hold on.
[44:37.89]I like this stuff over here.
[44:44.28]Isn't there something here?
[44:45.08]I always thought there was something over here.
[44:49.46]This, I remember this part.
[44:51.02]This part sucks.
[44:53.26]Because you can only breathe, you can only be underwater for 30 seconds before you start to drown.
[44:56.91]So you have to keep, there's like oxygen pockets and shit.
[45:01.93]I'm just kidding!
[45:03.83]There's a page from the travelogue.
[45:05.23]Let's take a look.
[45:05.80]It looks boring.
[45:08.20]Here's the thing.
[45:09.62]I know the password already.
[45:11.46]I've known the password for 15 years.
[45:15.19]So, there's a password.
[45:18.11]I don't even need to know any of these things.
[45:21.06]Uh, we've managed to trap the giant squid in the treasure cellar.
[45:23.94]The treasure will sink with the ship, but so it goes.
[45:26.42]Uh, there's a big password you have to figure out.
[45:28.22]I already know what it is.
[45:29.94]So, I'm sorry to all the people that are, like, waiting for me to deduce this password.
[45:34.16]Took me a while to figure this out when I was 12.
[45:36.67]But ever since then, it's been burned in my brain.
[45:40.17]I don't need to do anything else.
[45:41.28]I'm already... Well, we'll just... I'll just pretend.
[45:43.80]Right?
[45:43.98]We'll do... I'm gonna do like a YouTube Let's Play here.
[45:49.50]We're done for.
[45:51.12]A giant squid got a hold of us.
[45:54.00]The ship's going down fast.
[45:57.86]No, I gotta save that one.
[45:58.74]I gotta save that voice for the actual pirate.
[46:05.55]The door to the cellar is locked with a password consisting of six letters.
[46:10.45]In order to proceed, you'll have to decipher the password using the six hints.
[46:15.63]By the way, the password is pearls.
[46:19.39]I win.
[46:19.71]Oh fuck, this is supposed to be a YouTube Let's Play.
[46:29.13]Sorry, guys.
[46:30.81]Uncover the secret of the six hints, of course, since they're provided by different people.
[46:35.63]That'd be pretty tough to solve.
[46:37.26]Maybe even impossible.
[46:47.79]Mm-hmm.
[46:48.09]Little secret.
[46:50.43]He's bad at tubing.
[46:53.15]I don't think he can be good at tubing.
[46:56.59]You just lie down on it and jump into the snow.
[47:00.88]And then you scream and pray.
[47:02.96]Okay, um... Let's go.
[47:26.19]They're scared.
[47:28.03]Willy Wisp.
[47:35.76]40 fucking damage.
[47:36.56]See, Malo would be dead.
[47:38.70]He would really only take one of those and then be gone.
[47:50.37]Damn.
[47:56.14]He's dead.
[48:01.83]This guy sucks.
[48:08.81]Ooh, Bowser level 10.
[48:14.57]Pretty good increases all around.
[48:17.69]Oh, Gino doesn't have any armor on.
[48:19.15]Oh yeah, that's right.
[48:19.85]Oh, right.
[48:20.77]You're right.
[48:21.15]You are right.
[48:21.69]Completely correct on that.
[48:23.57]Gino is not wearing armor.
[48:25.33]I have to go back and buy the sailor cape.
[48:29.88]Thank you for reminding me.
[48:31.50]But I can't afford it yet.
[48:47.11]Who gives the most money?
[48:53.13]Wow.
[48:55.17]76% of you guys.
[48:56.59]Most of you.
[48:56.95]Really, that's... I mean, yeah, I guess.
[48:58.79]He is really strong.
[49:00.69]There's a problem here, though.
[49:04.17]Two of the people in this current party, you're only giving power to.
[49:10.35]Mario and Bowser have not great HP and not good magic damage or defense.
[49:17.01]Only Geno does.
[49:18.75]So, and Geno is not wearing armor.
[49:22.63]You guys might have screwed this all up.
[49:24.95]I'm just saying.
[49:25.49]There we go, coins.
[49:40.32]How much money do I have now?
[49:42.48]136.
[49:42.60]I need, like, two 300.
[49:43.84]Eh, let's just get this over with.
[50:00.45]Didn't kill them.
[50:01.76]How?
[50:10.83]Shit.
[50:14.89]Come on!
[50:15.63]How are you doing less damage than Geno?
[50:20.47]This motherfucker's naked!
[50:24.52]Is it Geno again?
[50:25.68]Bye.
[50:26.10]He's dead.
[50:26.42]He has one health.
[50:27.22]He'll be fine.
[50:27.66]110 damage.
[50:33.10]These guys have a lot of armor, too.
[50:42.96]Once again, that's fine.
[50:45.94]Run away.
[50:46.48]I'm looking for about 200 coins.
[50:52.06]It's three.
[50:52.58]It's not 200.
[50:53.36]Shit.
[50:53.50]Oh.
[51:10.68]Shit.
[51:11.38]Okay, I gotta actually stop fucking around.
[51:31.51]Got it.
[51:38.13]Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[52:16.58]16 damage on a block?
[52:18.68]What the hell are you talking about?
[52:19.94]What the fuck just happened?
[52:21.84]He's got no armor!
[52:23.62]He doesn't have any fucking clothes on!
[52:26.70]Everything's fine.
[52:42.69]Don't run.
[52:47.38]Hundred.
[52:47.74]There we go.
[52:48.96]Okay.
[52:49.94]So.
[52:51.06]We've got six coins.
[52:53.18]Chance to double your coins.
[52:54.26]Let's do it.
[52:54.82]You ready?
[52:57.02]Give it all you got.
[52:57.98]Follow it.
[52:58.34]Okay.
[53:00.97]Help me.
[53:01.53]Help me.
[53:01.89]Help me.
[53:02.23]Help me.
[53:02.63]Help me.
[53:02.91]Why am I not using the scanline filters?
[53:07.31]Because they make me throw up.
[53:22.81]That's a pretty big amount of people.
[53:23.97]That's a... 47% think it's over here.
[53:32.28]I really hope the 14% of you that clicked on Genome... Actually, that you didn't know where it was.
[53:38.80]Because that's a lot of percentages.
[53:40.08]So here we go.
[53:40.71]Let's do it.
[53:43.43]You guys say the left.
[53:45.41]And you are correct.
[53:46.59]That is 12 coins, 15 EXP...
[53:51.39]No, I wanted to get away so I could heal.
[53:53.87]Okay, this is bad.
[53:59.17]This is really bad.
[54:00.35]Give me a chance.
[54:01.67]Gina has no fucking armor on.
[54:02.85]Okay, Bowser, you have to stay alive.
[54:04.43]Run, actually.
[54:05.05]Run away.
[54:06.25]You got away.
[54:06.69]Good.
[54:07.09]Oh my shit, that was fucking lucky.
[54:49.24]Okay.
[54:51.62]Good.
[54:54.38]Alright, now let's go back and get Geno's outfit.
[54:56.58]This is gonna be 300-something damage.
[55:07.17]No?
[55:08.01]These guys take a lot of damage.
[55:12.29]But they obviously are very hard to kill.
[55:17.66]Times that wrong.
[55:28.68]What was it?
[55:29.56]No, I forgot!
[55:31.01]You have to kill them with magic, I remember now.
[55:34.41]I remember, yup.
[55:35.77]They only die from magic.
[55:45.01]Go on Mario, go ahead.
[55:49.14]Sucks.
[55:50.66]No, he's not wearing any armor.
[55:52.77]That's why he's not very good.
[56:02.55]Okay, let's go back to the merchant and let's get what we need to get.
[56:15.08]This is who you guys want in Smash?
[56:16.78]Yes.
[56:18.12]Yes.
[56:21.15]And I turn my head slightly over my shoulder a little, and my face bright red.
[56:26.65]Yes.
[56:28.59]Like, I am embarrassed that he's not doing so well.
[56:32.29]Okay.
[56:40.00]Okay.
[56:41.72]Sailor cape.
[56:44.16]I have the sailor shirt.
[56:47.48]I now want the Hurley Gloves.
[56:50.88]This is for Bowser.
[56:51.66]I already got the handgun.
[56:54.41]Super Hammer.
[56:55.23]Is the Super Hammer... The Hurley Gloves are better.
[56:57.89]Are they than the Chomp?
[56:59.23]I don't remember.
[56:59.87]I think they are.
[57:01.81]We'll find out.
[57:04.91]Hurley Gloves.
[57:05.95]Oh yeah, they are.
[57:07.49]Sailor Cape.
[57:08.19]Finally, Geno won't die instantly.
[57:18.63]Okay, so I'm gonna sell the Chomp and I'm gonna get the... How much is this?
[57:24.54]107?
[57:24.64]You guys are gonna love the Hurly Gloves.
[57:33.10]Oh, nice.
[57:38.08]Is the Super Hammer as good as the Masher or Warhammer?
[57:41.11]I don't remember.
[57:48.24]I'm gonna find out.
[57:53.55]Damn it.
[57:55.65]It is worse than the last room.
[57:58.89]Fuck.
[57:59.37]Okay.
[58:08.40]Alright, now I'm gonna... Alright, pick-me-ups.
[58:10.90]Get another one.
[58:11.94]Get another one.
[58:13.90]Sell items.
[58:15.24]In fact, you know what?
[58:15.96]No, no, no, no, no.
[58:16.53]Take the... Use the flower jar.
[58:18.15]Like, for the love of God.
[58:20.63]What'd he use?
[58:21.19]That stupid, stupid idiot.
[58:24.05]Jeremy, what are you, dumb person?
[58:31.86]I need to use this during a boss fight.
[58:35.31]If I use this during a boss fight, it guarantees a luck.
[58:38.93]It guarantees one of those, uh, the three eggs of Yoshi.
[58:42.09]It's gonna be a lot on the line, so if I use this at a boss fight, I hope you guys are ready to really, truly try and pick the right one.
[58:53.02]That leaves me room to do a couple more mid-mushrooms.
[58:58.65]I have to trust you guys, I do.
[59:05.28]Let's do two more mid-mushrooms.
[59:10.42]I'm gonna pick Geno.
[59:29.22]I can leave.
[59:33.61]No, I can't leave.
[59:34.41]I just... No, I can't.
[59:41.12]I didn't ban anybody.
[59:42.50]I just sucked up all their messages in a vacuum cleaner.
[59:48.36]They're still here.
[59:49.22]Alright, check this out.
[60:11.78]Want to see something funny?
[60:20.30]I love freaking out my new guests with that one.
[60:25.75]Those of you guys that are new to the stream, you're probably like, what the fuck?
[60:28.99]Man, this stream is awesome!
[60:32.29]I love freaking out new guests.
[60:48.61]Okay, lucky, there it is.
[60:49.67]I'm going to do this one.
[60:55.87]Is that what we are?
[60:56.47]We're guests?
[60:57.13]Could be.
[61:03.19]I wasn't prepared for that.
[61:06.00]Okay, that can kill you.
[61:08.18]And now he throws the little action figure.
[61:15.59]19 and 8.
[61:16.57]Double the coins.
[61:17.29]I can handle this one.
[61:18.05]I'll get this one.
[61:18.59]But I do need to heal.
[61:21.29]I don't need to do it to Bowser.
[61:22.83]He'll be fine.
[61:48.61]Bowser can handle it.
[61:51.19]Okay, so.
[61:52.59]Let's go.
[61:54.05]Everybody has their gear.
[61:55.27]Everyone's got all this stuff that they need.
[62:04.08]Damn it.
[62:04.46]I tried to jump the whole thing.
[62:08.30]I need this, though, because otherwise I'm going to get slam dunked on.
[62:15.70]This is going to be interesting, what happens here.
[62:19.30]Yeah, aren't you glad that Mario has no magic defense?
[62:21.33]Because he's almost dead.
[62:24.67]You guys glad you clicked on power 12 times?
[62:27.23]10 times?
[62:39.88]That was the plan.
[62:41.78]How did I miss everybody?
[62:43.18]Oh, come on.
[63:07.47]Go to the back.
[63:12.27]If we didn't click health once, you'd have the strength to do this.
[63:16.01]I'm good.
[63:22.19]Another Lucky.
[63:31.72]Do the shpee voice.
[63:32.74]I don't remember how.
[63:37.48]Experience.
[63:38.00]This is important.
[63:42.40]I have no idea.
[63:43.32]Help me.
[63:44.44]This is for like 30 EXP.
[63:45.66]That's pretty good.
[63:46.22]Okay.
[64:20.96]1 versus 100.
[64:25.62]Alright, so... How do I get this one?
[64:30.12]Like that.
[64:34.01]Memo left by Magellan.
[64:35.51]There's an S in the word.
[64:36.85]I can skip this whole thing, by the way.
[64:40.77]I already... I know.
[64:41.49]I know, though.
[64:45.60]I know the whole thing.
[64:54.76]That's not cheating.
[64:55.56]Okay, if you study for your math test and you know the math problems, are you cheating on your math test?
[65:09.67]I'm sorry, I didn't know.
[65:23.66]Second try.
[65:24.36]I am gonna do this for the flower tabs though.
[65:28.22]It is found on the bed of the ocean and it has an S. It is a pearls.
[65:33.46]Now let's just, you know, let's level up a little.
[65:37.13]This is gonna be a tough fight.
[65:45.37]Who's the most dangerous?
[65:46.72]Probably the Grim Reaper.
[65:59.60]I'm not messing around Fuck And die
[66:31.98]I wish I had a Lucky right here.
[66:33.02]That's pretty good, actually.
[66:35.43]I want the flower tabs.
[66:38.43]This is a three-dimensional maze.
[66:41.05]Press X if you give up.
[67:05.44]I'm just feeling on the walls.
[67:12.14]What?
[67:12.66]No, go back over here.
[67:24.20]Jump over that.
[67:28.35]Jump on this.
[67:33.91]Come out this door.
[68:07.83]I can't... I don't know how to do it.
[68:15.98]I can't move anywhere.
[68:21.01]I got nowhere to go.
[68:39.34]Am I even up a level?
[68:53.58]I'm stuck.
[68:55.36]I think I'm actually stuck up here.
[68:59.08]I'm pressing up, down, left.
[69:00.56]I'm trying to move.
[69:22.88]Am I there?
[69:23.70]Where am I?
[69:38.14]I can get like up here somewhere.
[69:40.43]Okay.
[69:42.33]I can't go up left.
[69:43.79]I can go left.
[69:46.24]But that brings me all the way down here.
[69:48.04]Can I go right from here?
[69:49.94]Okay.
[69:50.76]Can I go up from here?
[69:52.28]Can I go down from here?
[69:54.39]Can I go left from here?
[69:56.21]Can I go up from here?
[69:57.65]Can I go down from here?
[70:06.37]Okay.
[70:06.87]Up.
[70:07.95]Left.
[70:10.09]Right.
[70:15.55]Jump.
[70:16.51]Okay.
[70:17.55]Right.
[70:18.65]Up.
[70:20.25]Jump.
[70:21.87]Right.
[70:22.33]Jump.
[70:23.63]Down.
[70:24.05]Jump.
[70:25.05]Right.
[70:26.00]Jump.
[70:27.22]Down.
[70:27.54]Jump.
[70:28.38]Right.
[70:29.00]Jump.
[70:29.86]Down.
[70:30.24]Jump.
[70:31.18]Right.
[70:31.56]Jump.
[70:32.26]Up.
[70:32.50]Jump.
[70:34.74]Left.
[70:35.00]Jump.
[70:35.78]Up.
[70:36.02]Jump.
[70:40.27]Down.
[70:44.74]right up there's like something something blocking me here okay
[71:43.92]The fuck am I?
[71:45.64]Come on, Mario.
[71:46.56]Get over here.
[71:47.16]Ooh, ooh.
[71:53.78]All right.
[71:54.81]Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for viewing.
[72:00.49]That's two vowels.
[72:02.96]This is royal syrup.
[72:05.59]I'll replace a honey syrup.
[72:14.79]I'm out.
[72:15.41]Got it.
[72:23.52]Can't jump down?
[72:24.40]That's fine.
[72:28.50]Oh, there's the guy that sells stuff.
[72:33.63]Hey, it's good to see you!
[72:37.13]If only I had known.
[72:37.85]I forgot that you were here.
[72:39.92]I want... I got pretty much everything I need.
[72:44.74]I'll give you a hint.
[72:45.86]The password has something to do with... the sea.
[72:51.18]Even if you don't get through all six of the obstacles, you can try to deduce your way through.
[72:55.66]Good luck.
[73:02.01]Can I jump over you?
[73:03.37]I think I can.
[73:07.34]No, I can't.
[73:08.02]Just bite him.
[73:11.28]Let's do... This is actually kind of a... Big fight.
[73:22.05]Come on, Mario!
[73:33.44]Got'em all!
[73:34.18]Boom boom!
[73:39.27]Piss.
[73:39.55]Damage.
[73:40.39]Ow.
[74:05.01]That was a big hit.
[74:05.97]Lucky.
[74:16.96]You can't stay awake?
[74:18.39]I can help.
[74:20.75]This is only for that person, so everybody else mute.
[74:23.37]I'm gonna give you three seconds.
[74:36.93]I just... they have a chalkboard back here and I just scraped.
[74:40.01]Okay, tell everybody they can unmute me.
[74:42.29]Yeah, you can unmute.
[75:17.22]No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, not yet.
[75:20.52]Can you do that, but louder?
[75:21.58]No.
[75:22.50]That's as loud as you're ever gonna get.
[75:25.45]That was just enough of a weird sound to have somebody go, what the fuck was that?
[75:34.43]Alright, now pick, please.
[75:41.94]Super lame.
[75:59.14]Going for power again?
[76:02.91]He's screaming.
[76:05.15]I'm just sitting here going like... I wouldn't want to miss that, to be honest.
[76:18.63]I just blow out my vocal cords screaming as loud as I can.
[76:22.17]I can't do that.
[76:23.41]If I were to do that, if I were to scream as loud as I fucking can, I would have to stop screaming.
[76:28.21]It would be over.
[76:35.50]I would shout like this for the rest of the entire day, and it would hurt.
[76:38.38]I don't know how people scream.
[76:53.86]Because they're angry.
[76:56.94]I guess that's true.
[77:04.76]Wait a minute.
[77:05.28]Are you guys actually clicking on HP?
[77:10.68]I'm very interested in this.
[77:12.76]Okay.
[77:13.30]Thank you.
[77:13.68]89.
[77:13.70]Mallow didn't even have to do anything, and he's level...
[77:36.76]Mala learns Shocker.
[77:38.12]Hmm, super.
[78:04.26]What is end of career?
[78:05.64]What the fuck is end of career voice?
[78:09.76]Playing Sekiro.
[78:10.38]What?
[78:10.58]Hold on, I need to hear this.
[78:12.16]This is important.
[78:13.49]I need to know what the fuck this is.
[78:15.39]End of career?
[78:15.83]What did I do?
[78:35.01]I just want to hear it.
[78:46.35]I don't know.
[78:46.91]I can't think of anybody.
[78:50.72]Marge Simpson?
[78:53.80]Home.
[78:54.20]Home run.
[78:54.94]No, that's going to fix it.
[78:55.64]Home run.
[78:57.77]Holy shit.
[78:58.65]It's Joan Rivers.
[79:00.61]Oh, Joan Rivers.
[79:01.91]Absolutely.
[79:02.61]It's unbelievable.
[79:03.45]Oh, darling, you look so beautiful right now on the runway.
[79:06.51]Let me tell you something about just how... I forgot about the fucking... I forgot.
[79:10.62]Fucking let's go.
[79:11.66]I can't fix it.
[79:12.46]I think I have this voice forever.
[79:14.24]I have this voice forever.
[79:15.58]I fucked it up.
[79:16.78]I coughed too much and now it's over.
[79:18.32]I actually have this voice forever.
[79:20.92]This is it.
[79:21.38]My career is over.
[79:22.94]Oh my god.
[79:24.98]My career is over.
[79:30.58]I have to turn into Larry the Cable Guy!
[79:34.22]Oh, no!
[79:36.46]Hold on, I'll be back.
[79:40.92]I actually remember this, because I remember I started doing, like, Bernie Sanders and Larry David and shit.
[79:48.01]That was crazy, though.
[79:49.15]Damn.
[79:50.01]Good thing I recovered.
[79:50.83]What'd you guys pick?
[79:55.99]You picked this one.
[80:04.42]Oh, crazy.
[80:05.20]Haha, damn.
[80:07.34]It's a good thing that you... No, I don't smoke.
[80:12.74]I don't smoke.
[80:14.80]Quit spreading rumors about me.
[80:16.48]49.
[80:18.72]Does he have the highest?
[80:21.65]He might.
[80:24.53]Fuck.
[80:25.65]Oh, it's a bunch of coins.
[80:31.41]Damn it.
[80:38.31]Okay.
[80:38.85]Crystal.
[80:42.58]How do you have that clip just ready to go?
[80:44.40]Daryl slaps himself.
[81:03.87]That is the worst clip ever.
[81:07.03]That's seriously the worst clip that's ever been recorded on this room.
[81:09.81]It has to be.
[81:15.12]It has to be.
[81:30.87]How do you slap yourself?
[81:33.23]I... Very carefully.
[81:39.40]Bone, got it.
[81:42.14]What the fuck?
[81:51.07]Alright, Peach is level 11.
[81:56.98]She will have the highest magic attack of the whole group, I believe.
[82:01.94]And she learns Sleepy Time.
[82:06.52]Give me something to work with her.
[82:16.99]We're gonna have to make a pretty major decision soon as to what we want to make our final party look like.
[82:28.17]Is it gonna be Peach, Mario, and Bowser?
[82:31.15]Is it gonna be Peach, Mario, and Mallow?
[82:34.17]Is it gonna be Geno, Mario, and Mallow?
[82:37.16]Is it gonna be Geno, Toadstool, and Bowser?
[82:44.46]Come on!
[82:47.11]I can see somebody with the extension not installed, and you're not clicking.
[82:50.94]This isn't... We're at 43, 42.
[82:52.40]Come on.
[82:53.14]Thank you.
[83:03.27]I'm so sorry.
[83:04.05]Alright, it's gonna be HP.
[83:07.25]Thank you for voting.
[83:08.27]3, 2, 1.
[83:14.57]But that actually helps a lot.
[83:19.62]Alright, now do I have enough money to pay for something?
[83:23.10]Let me see.
[83:23.84]Let me see.
[83:24.34]We've got six pick-me-ups.
[83:26.72]Seven maple syrups.
[83:27.56]That's a lot of maple syrups that I probably don't need.
[83:30.87]Okay.
[83:40.23]Chop.
[83:43.71]I want the stuff that's in here.
[83:53.66]There's a screw that's getting really loose on my chair.
[83:58.14]And I could probably really easily screw it in.
[83:59.62]And I think it's one of those scenarios where it's a very major, like, construction part of this chair.
[84:07.99]And if it goes, the whole chair might just break underneath me.
[84:15.41]I'll be fine.
[84:17.23]Floating coins?! !
[84:28.35]Load-bearing screw?
[84:40.72]I can farm coins here though, can't I?
[84:46.66]No!
[84:47.24]Ah!
[84:52.15]No!
[84:58.33]What the fuck?
[85:05.99]No!
[85:14.30]What?
[85:24.76]I'm actually mad about this.
[85:31.57]How am I not touching this one?
[85:40.24]What the hell are you doing?
[86:16.47]I thought I was going to turn into something else.
[86:39.26]You guys realize I never did these because I knew it was pearls.
[86:43.33]Was that so hard?
[86:44.07]No, but I thought I had to keep up with it.
[86:46.57]I never did that one.
[86:47.96]Half of these I didn't do because I knew it was pearls.
[86:49.70]So I didn't do them.
[86:50.28]I've never walked in these fucking rooms.
[86:58.31]That's the first time I've ever been in that room.
[87:13.93]I knew someone was going to say it.
[87:14.97]I was waiting for someone to say Sans.
[87:18.70]Every time this character pops up, I look over at chat and I don't see it.
[87:21.80]I'm like, really?
[87:23.64]How?
[87:23.81]Because nobody said it yet.
[87:26.97]I knew it was going to happen.
[87:27.91]I was waiting.
[87:35.92]Okay, those of you that are, like, really, like, big fans of Undertale and Sans, if Sans was in Smash Bros., Sans from Undertale is in Smash Bros., but he was $150, would you buy it?
[87:46.54]I'd be tempted.
[88:07.53]He's not in a pass.
[88:10.03]He's $149.
[88:18.77]Finally crossed 100 HP with some character.
[88:20.79]That's good.
[88:38.14]Nothing is too much for Sans Would you pay that much for Geno in Smash?
[88:46.59]No I would not
[88:58.97]Now there is my public persona, where I say no, and there's my private, um, in the dark, in my bedroom, when nobody can see what I'm doing, and I've got my credit card, and I'm punching in the numbers, and make sure nobody's around, and then I have Gino, you know, there's that.
[89:26.13]And I don't know who's gonna even know.
[89:28.77]I'll just always disconnect my Switch from online.
[89:32.41]You guys pick the power.
[89:40.67]Alright.
[89:42.37]Boom.
[89:54.66]I think I have to jump on them.
[89:55.74]I'm telling you, I've never went in these rooms.
[90:01.12]I've never been inside of these rooms in 20 years.
[90:04.38]I think I have to move it?
[90:15.78]Yep.
[90:18.77]Ah.
[90:29.25]Mushroom!
[90:30.01]And it's worthless.
[90:35.09]At last, two consonants are side by side.
[90:38.97]At least two consonants are side by side.
[90:42.16]That's a stumper.
[90:45.96]Save it.
[90:52.79]And... What?
[90:53.47]How do I do this puzzle?
[91:06.64]Maybe I'm gonna do it from high up.
[91:09.12]Oh, it's not working!
[91:20.56]Mario's password is motes.
[91:50.99]The R comes before the 1.
[91:57.14]Just like Portal, yeah?
[91:59.02]Alright, it's Pearls.
[92:00.00]For those of you guys that this is your first time watching.
[92:03.40]Letter number 1 is... P. Letter number 2 is E. A. R. L. S.
[92:20.27]The password is...pearls.
[92:25.16]Good job.
[92:27.06]I'll let you through.
[92:29.60]If you can get past me first, that is.
[92:32.36]Secret.
[92:43.17]Octopus battle.
[92:57.92]Whack!
[93:00.08]Ooh, that hurts.
[93:06.65]Damn.
[93:07.97]Bowser, you do a ton of damage.
[93:26.18]Am I playing... I'm playing on an SNES... I'm playing on an SNES Classic.
[93:31.94]The little... mini thing.
[93:33.48]Mmm!
[93:41.60]Mmm!
[93:43.16]Mmm!
[93:55.94]And then if memory serves me correct, after this, there is... This is the part of the controversy that Nintendo had to face, was that character's gone.
[94:09.59]And a lot of the reviewers were really upset about it.
[94:12.06]They were like, wait, what happened to my character?
[94:13.20]They never explained it.
[94:14.52]Bowser's just gone.
[94:15.24]He's just dead.
[94:19.29]I know a lot of people got upset about it and didn't, like, they stopped playing here.
[94:25.48]Same joke for me.
[94:26.80]I mean, come on.
[94:27.40]I have to make, every time I have to make that joke.
[94:30.28]I have to.
[94:30.72]It's not old material if it was less than 24 hours ago.
[94:39.12]This is not my, like, comedy special from 2006.
[94:42.01]This was 12 hours ago.
[94:59.26]Alright, I get a heal.
[95:02.14]Let's heal Geno.
[95:03.82]Alright, I like to go right for the legs.
[95:14.18]So we're going to go left leg, and then right leg, and then face.
[95:16.92]Because these things are annoying.
[95:17.86]They do like 10 damage every hit.
[95:20.41]I'm not a fan of it.
[95:22.05]So I want to get rid of them.
[95:26.29]In fact, let's do Super Flame.
[95:36.57]96.
[95:39.09]How we doing?
[95:39.51]Venom drool.
[95:45.16]Didn't really do much now, did it?
[95:46.38]Okay, let's get another... No, no, no, no.
[95:50.44]I need to save these.
[95:54.14]Let's do a, you know, beam.
[96:03.69]Remember when you did that stand-up set for Comedy Central in 2005?
[96:05.97]That was great.
[96:12.49]Yeah, and remember I made that joke about how... Fuck.
[96:15.70]Remember I made that funny joke about how Super Mario RPG, when Bowser gets thrown up in the air?
[96:21.38]How much controversy.
[96:22.14]Imagine going on stage and saying that, like, telling that.
[96:24.92]No one ever had any idea what you're talking about.
[96:32.80]Do I use a pick-me-up here, or do I just do this without Mario?
[96:50.37]Throwing undead Mario, yeah.
[96:56.01]132, pretty good!
[97:02.03]Shit!
[97:02.87]I didn't get that?
[97:06.59]You know what?
[97:10.88]Just boost Bowser.
[97:14.02]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[97:30.11]Drain beam on all of them.
[97:31.75]Uh-oh.
[97:35.19]Mario, your defense is so bad against magic.
[97:39.93]Can I replace Mario?
[97:54.82]No, no, no!
[98:06.12]That's it.
[98:06.58]I'm free.
[98:08.72]Mario might be dead here again.
[98:13.58]I'm doing it without Mario.
[98:14.67]He's not... He's just... He's a... He's turning into, like, some... He's a liability at this point.
[98:22.63]Got it.
[98:24.05]I'm so glad I did not use... That pick-me-up, because I'm gonna need it.
[98:30.71]100 coins, 34 experience.
[98:33.21]That's pretty good.
[98:35.87]Alright, let's heal up.
[98:43.18]Everybody is alright.
[98:43.84]Oh, everybody is?
[98:44.50]No, that's fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
[98:54.44]Hello?
[98:55.22]Wait, go in here.
[99:01.49]Should I attack one of these?
[99:02.67]How close is everybody to leveling up?
[99:10.74]70, 175.
[99:11.12]Alright.
[99:11.73]We're gonna... We're pretty much there.
[99:13.93]Another two or three battles should do it.
[99:23.54]Never mind.
[99:24.48]I'm gonna climb up here.
[99:28.16]Why did I show those stats?
[99:29.18]They're terrible.
[99:29.74]They're not terrible.
[99:33.93]They're fine.
[99:34.37]They're just fine.
[99:44.63]I don't like this.
[100:02.57]You just did so many fakeouts.
[100:04.31]I don't even know which one of those is real.
[100:08.45]Holy shit, that's a lot of damage.
[100:15.25]Once again.
[100:31.99]Damn it.
[100:39.39]Oh, Mario.
[100:40.81]Mario.
[100:42.37]Mario, your defense is so bad.
[100:49.51]I should just do a two-person team at this point.
[101:09.31]20 experience.
[101:10.03]Alright, on this next level up, we really gotta figure this out.
[101:12.45]Mario's starting to become extreme weight.
[101:17.77]In fact, I'm gonna do this now, because Mario's just not good.
[101:22.07]At all.
[101:36.38]How about more power?
[101:40.69]I gotta get him a better item.
[101:43.03]The masher is good, but...
[101:50.30]Almost there.
[101:50.86]Another, like, two fights or so should do it.
[101:56.00]Oh, come on.
[101:57.94]Really?
[101:59.14]What are you doing back here?
[102:00.02]Once again.
[102:18.05]57 damage.
[102:19.05]Why do I feel like there's something wrong with his character?
[102:24.59]Look at how much Bowser's gonna do right here.
[102:26.76]To the mouse.
[102:28.44]150?
[102:29.56]What's wrong with Mario?
[102:30.64]Is he alright?
[102:43.91]Ow, my face.
[102:55.51]Alright, here comes the opportunity.
[102:59.47]That's a lot of coins.
[103:18.83]What the fuck?
[103:21.82]Which one's me?
[103:22.24]I don't know which one I am.
[103:39.61]Easiest fight of the night, right here.
[103:52.22]Is the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man?
[103:58.24]Fuck, I fell off.
[104:03.16]Is something in here?
[104:03.82]I think there is something in here, actually.
[104:20.10]Alright, which one am I?
[104:25.54]What?
[104:33.61]Kiro Kiro Cola!
[104:42.10]Alright, I'm jumping out of the fucking map of the game.
[104:47.09]I'm going to the developer.
[104:49.29]That's all, folks!
[105:08.30]Caracola is amazing, though.
[105:21.90]Not Mario.
[105:23.12]Whatever.
[105:29.00]Alright, don't... This is bad, potentially.
[105:34.72]Not quite.
[105:38.32]I'm not going to use it.
[105:40.84]I can do it.
[105:42.14]We can do this together.
[105:49.57]The only threat is this thing back here.
[105:52.81]Good.
[105:59.06]We're going to heal up with Mallow.
[106:01.58]And I'll be good to go.
[106:04.16]Actually, I'll heal from the level up that's about to happen.
[106:21.83]There we go.
[106:22.60]Mario has reached level 11.
[106:25.40]Magic defense increased to 23.
[106:26.56]That's better.
[107:16.27]Geno Whirl, there it is.
[107:17.47]Geno Whirl can do 999 damage.
[107:24.77]If you do it right.
[107:46.53]9,999.
[107:46.59]This is closer, but... Oh, hold on.
[108:03.06]Hold on.
[108:09.30]Alright.
[108:10.28]That's it.
[108:10.86]That's it.
[108:12.14]Thank you.
[108:12.50]That's it.
[108:20.04]52 magic attack.
[108:22.36]And there's Mallow.
[108:28.60]Magic is so strong sometimes, but he's so weak.
[108:38.77]His defense is 30.
[108:42.67]And when your HP is that low and your defense is that low, you just get hit by one thing and you immediately need to eat a whole mushroom.
[108:49.05]Not good.
[108:49.57]Right flower gang.
[109:21.15]Right flower.
[109:23.67]Wait, I gotta get over there.
[109:24.47]Alright, everyone's been healed.
[109:32.53]Except for Bowser, right?
[109:33.69]No.
[109:34.47]Bowser's still... Ah!
[109:42.06]Oh, okay.
[109:43.10]I actually have to take one of these, otherwise I'm gonna be in deep shit.
[109:49.30]But I have to do the magic.
[109:51.20]Oops.
[109:51.66]Alright, Bowsie, come on.
[109:57.62]Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.
[110:19.54]Mario did something.
[110:23.20]A little bit.
[110:31.59]Ah!
[110:32.17]That's so annoying.
[110:32.87]Because now I have to... Let's just do... No, Geno Roll is 8.
[110:37.15]Geno Beam on Dry Bones.
[110:50.07]New weapon.
[110:50.53]New weapon.
[110:50.97]Need a new weapon for Mario.
[110:51.89]Bad.
[110:52.19]Come on.
[111:08.64]I need to accessorize as well.
[111:34.57]Give Mario the amulet?
[111:35.57]Yeah.
[111:41.77]He's gonna have such terrible power, though.
[111:43.17]Then what about, what about, uh, what about Genno?
[111:55.82]Come on!
[111:57.50]I'm trying to get rid of the two in the back there, and now I have to Geno beam this Dry Bones.
[112:04.77]Irritating.
[112:18.12]I have to do something here, like... We have to get rid of Thump Somebody.
[112:24.92]This is gonna kill it, right?
[112:25.90]Yeah.
[112:26.20]I mean, come on.
[112:31.88]Shit, that's not good.
[112:34.42]Uh, Mario's dead.
[112:36.02]And Bowser.
[112:37.84]This is cutting it close.
[112:38.66]This is cutting it way too close.
[112:41.06]This is a really, really stupid idea.
[112:43.45]In fact, it's so dumb, in fact, that I have to heal.
[112:46.79]I'm gonna heal Bowser.
[112:54.73]See?
[113:00.46]This is the no-healer team.
[113:01.58]Yeah, this is straight offense.
[113:04.06]This is offense to the max.
[113:06.36]Nice throw.
[113:27.59]Pure water.
[113:28.43]I could sell that for a lot.
[113:30.35]Alright.
[113:30.81]Now there's something back here.
[113:32.40]Something back here.
[113:33.50]Nope.
[113:33.78]Nothing back here.
[113:34.32]Nothing back there.
[113:34.80]Alright.
[113:35.00]I just had to check.
[113:50.09]Full health.
[113:50.51]Let's see here.
[114:02.33]Oh, this is where it is.
[114:05.51]Okay.
[114:07.29]You got it.
[114:07.85]I got him.
[114:08.23]Alright.
[114:12.45]This is another Mimic.
[114:18.67]Ow.
[114:20.37]Do you know where?
[114:20.91]Oh, let's go, baby.
[114:25.95]Damn it, I didn't get it.
[114:28.36]It's right after it hits, right?
[114:29.86]It's like right after it goes offscreen?
[114:37.75]Or is it right when he winks to the camera?
[114:43.49]Holy shit, that was a lot of damage.
[114:56.16]That was so much.
[114:57.42]Let's get it.
[115:21.49]Oh my god, I just, I destroyed this thing.
[115:28.96]I love the little itchy Goombas.
[115:34.96]They're like the little, like, itchies.
[115:46.85]Ow.
[115:48.98]Ow.
[115:50.54]22 fucking damage, Mario.
[115:52.14]Are you for real?
[115:53.40]Are we sure that Mario has armor on?
[115:57.24]I didn't take Mario's armor off, right?
[115:58.70]100 coins, 17 experience, and...
[116:19.32]Got a safety badge.
[116:24.76]Very cool.
[116:25.84]Actually, let's do some reorganizing here.
[116:28.14]Safety badge.
[116:29.06]Prevents mute and poison attacks.
[116:35.55]The amulet on Mario... is not as good as the amulet on... Actually, the amulet on Geno is also bad.
[116:50.53]125, but wake-up pin.
[116:51.99]No.
[116:52.59]Jump shoes.
[116:53.87]The jump shoes are better than the amulet?
[116:55.37]How the fuck is that possible?
[117:00.87]No.
[117:01.81]I am really, really stupid.
[117:04.95]I read it backwards for no reason.
[117:07.41]Alright, safety badge is better than the... yeah.
[117:14.33]Uh, that prevents mutant poison.
[117:15.93]What is this next?
[117:18.64]I think that's better, because now Mario's got 74, 45... 62, 45, so Geno now is gonna be pretty... pretty shitty.
[117:30.49]It's alright, though.
[117:31.11]I think we're good.
[117:36.46]Uh, let's take... Uh, Mushroom, Max Mushroom.
[117:42.22]I need some mushrooms.
[117:43.92]I have all these, like, Carro Caracolas.
[117:52.39]Too much maple syrup.
[117:57.61]Pick me up, pick me up.
[117:59.11]Mushroom, mid-mushroom, mid-mushroom, max mushroom, max mushroom.
[118:11.10]Jupiter storm coming in.
[118:13.29]Whatever.
[118:21.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[118:24.16]Alright, here we go.
[118:25.30]It's... What?
[118:28.62]Why is this back?
[118:31.20]Oh.
[118:35.34]Go to the door.
[118:36.08]Was there a door here?
[118:38.51]Is it a door?
[118:41.45]Holy shit!
[118:43.11]It's a frog coin!
[118:43.87]We gotta jump immediately.
[118:47.57]Nope.
[118:48.01]Jump.
[118:48.85]One.
[118:50.17]Two.
[118:52.43]No, you idiot.
[118:56.88]Wait, I can... I gotta run.
[119:04.92]I don't wanna fight this.
[119:06.47]No, I'll just fight it.
[119:16.57]No, I wanted to run!
[119:18.47]Good.
[119:23.03]Alright.
[119:34.52]Frog coin down there.
[119:35.46]I wonder if I can go in a little whirlpool or something.
[119:41.75]There's a lot of frog coins down here.
[119:43.31]Three.
[119:47.47]Keep your eye on those.
[119:48.77]We're gonna check this out later.
[119:59.67]Oh, it's Christmas morning.
[120:05.82]Wow, nice.
[120:10.04]When's the carnival stream?
[120:10.88]September 21st.
[120:11.38]Is there anything else up here?
[120:19.67]No, the door, right?
[120:20.59]No.
[120:28.03]Yeah.
[120:31.09]Now we're underwater.
[120:53.83]See you in 19 days!
[121:01.51]That's true.
[121:03.19]I will be here in 19 days.
[121:08.90]I'm running away!
[121:10.22]Ow!
[121:17.83]Coward!
[121:24.85]I'm telling my mom on you.
[121:39.94]Indecisive today.
[121:43.68]I feel like all of Toadstools have been completely split.
[121:48.66]At least 20-30% on each one.
[121:49.40]I wonder why that is.
[122:06.20]75.
[122:06.30]Ayayay.
[122:18.31]I think they have 100 health.
[122:20.93]Mr. Kipper.
[122:21.87]36.
[122:23.15]What is that bullshit?
[122:49.86]You want me to bring Peach out?
[122:50.52]Who do I replace?
[122:51.02]75, 97... So I do the original Nintendo Dream Team?
[123:21.99]Bowser's too good.
[123:23.00]Bowser's the best of the three so far.
[123:25.38]I'll do it for a little bit.
[123:26.14]Uh, hold on.
[123:27.88]Does she have any weapons?
[123:31.22]She has Slap Glove, Polka Dress, and... She's about to have a wake-up pin.
[123:38.35]No, get the thing off of Gino.
[123:42.59]What does Gino have for a... Safety Badge, right.
[123:54.43]Get Mario out of here?
[123:55.50]I would.
[123:57.42]I can't.
[124:01.20]62.
[124:02.94]Wake up in jump shoes.
[124:03.84]Alright, let's see what she can do.
[124:14.61]Boink, boink.
[124:20.57]Boink, boink.
[124:26.39]All this stuff is outdated.
[124:28.97]Oh shit, that's right.
[124:30.33]Uh-oh.
[124:33.19]What's going on here?
[124:34.99]Who are you?
[124:38.55]What are you looking for?
[124:39.73]A star?
[124:41.13]I'll let you see stars.
[124:44.92]Anyway, you're out of luck.
[124:46.70]You see, whatever falls into the sea becomes Johnny's property.
[124:51.04]Got that, matey?
[124:53.04]Oh, and one last thing.
[124:54.71]Read my lips.
[124:56.63]We ain't letting you through.
[124:58.87]Got it?
[125:10.52]Read my lips.
[125:12.48]No new taxes.
[125:15.60]Therapy.
[125:17.53]Group hug.
[125:19.43]Sleepy time.
[125:33.05]It didn't do anything!
[125:35.41]Oh!
[125:36.25]Oh, my chest!
[125:45.16]Ooh.
[125:55.97]210.
[125:55.99]You guys wanted me to replace Bowser?
[126:01.56]That's a great move.
[126:02.34]That's a great attack.
[126:04.78]Whack Whack!
[126:05.68]Whack!
[126:17.61]Turma sucks.
[126:18.25]Turma sucks.
[126:18.77]What the hell is this?
[126:22.51]Bowser level 12.
[126:25.78]Breached 100 attack.
[126:28.12]Magic attack and magic defense is so bad, though.
[126:30.25]Terrible.
[126:31.09]Just awful.
[126:33.71]I have to put Geno back in because she doesn't have any of her armor or any new weapon or anything, so we're going to have to do it after this.
[126:52.64]She's a healer.
[126:53.82]Okay.
[126:54.22]Alright.
[126:54.68]No, I'll stick with it.
[127:04.32]Power.
[127:05.22]More power.
[127:06.10]More power.
[127:06.80]105.
[127:14.18]Alright, you're stronger than you look.
[127:21.45]Better warm the upper deck.
[127:23.31]Come on, mate!
[127:28.55]Ding.
[127:32.63]Alright, where's the intruder?
[127:35.99]I don't see him.
[127:38.01]Did he get away?
[127:38.83]There he is.
[127:42.53]Get him, boys.
[127:46.07]Here, this is on us.
[127:50.39]Oh, what the, how dare you dodge the barrel?
[127:55.25]Are you guys all right?
[127:55.83]Are you guys okay?
[128:02.81]Hey, how'd you get up here so fast?
[128:06.45]Well, your luck has run out.
[128:08.81]We don't take kindly to strangers here.
[128:10.61]That's a lot.
[128:14.15]Okay, this is a lot.
[128:15.77]Poison gas time.
[128:25.87]Ooh, that's pretty good.
[128:29.75]Are they poisoned?
[128:36.36]Ooh, they are poisoned.
[128:44.01]Eight damage, a tick.
[128:46.65]That's not good.
[128:50.25]Let's do it again.
[128:55.85]I wonder if I'll do it... There!
[128:57.49]Nice.
[129:03.81]I think I can kill them all with just regular attacks now.
[129:13.84]Not quite.
[129:25.14]Dealing 70 damage is pretty good regardless of no magic.
[129:27.72]Yeah, that is really good.
[129:35.98]You're pretty tough, mate.
[129:37.77]Alright.
[129:38.69]I'll let you through to the Johnny's place.
[129:42.91]You're pretty tough.
[129:45.23]You're pretty tough.
[129:55.25]So, you're the Mario.
[129:58.45]Not much to look at.
[130:00.23]Well, this star fell into my sea, so it's mine.
[130:03.81]If you want it, you'll have to fight for it.
[130:19.76]Here's a boss fight.
[130:21.82]I probably could have done that a little more, a little more motion in there.
[130:26.58]Got them all except for the one over here.
[130:41.37]All right, I'm thinking a super jump on Johnny.
[130:56.22]58.
[130:57.08]70!
[130:57.20]Whoa!
[130:58.00]That's really, really fucking good.
[131:00.28]That's... Alright, Bowser.
[131:02.45]You've solidified yourself as the best character.
[131:18.19]Now, the strategy here is you want to get rid of the minions, but you want to leave a minion.
[131:25.61]Because if you don't... Ooh, and guys, I just got a lucky, you know what that means?
[131:29.95]I'm gonna be relying on you.
[131:32.51]To double whatever happens here.
[131:37.83]This is gonna be a huge deal.
[131:41.63]Uh, I do not want to kill... Lucky again.
[131:48.13]Double.
[131:48.63]Uh, I'm going to heal myself.
[131:57.96]That's a pretty good heal.
[132:03.44]That's so good.
[132:04.83]It's almost worth doing the poison gas and killing this thing again.
[132:06.97]102.
[132:10.85]Get tough!
[132:11.17]I wonder... Can I, like, put him to sleep?
[132:28.78]I wonder if I can mess him up.
[132:38.09]Yeah, it takes less damage now.
[132:39.35]Mmm, we're good.
[132:55.53]You're doing a status effect on a boss in an RPG.
[133:01.53]Well, I know, right.
[133:03.15]It's a bad idea.
[133:04.23]They're all immune.
[133:10.21]That was terrible.
[133:24.64]Don't kill him.
[133:25.38]It's a shiny.
[133:33.27]Well, that's just too bad.
[133:39.91]If it truly was a shiny, he'd have sprinkles flying around him.
[133:44.03]Come on.
[133:50.64]Uh, let's try flame.
[134:00.75]26 Come on Stop it.
[134:11.09]Who, who needs a heal?
[134:12.04]Should I top off somebody?
[134:13.92]Let's just group hug Good.
[134:20.36]Wow, Peach is actually pretty damn good See you later.
[134:26.16]See you later, Tony
[134:31.62]Alright.
[134:32.76]Guys.
[134:33.06]Double your coins.
[134:37.09]Or lose them all.
[134:41.95]I probably should have given you just a second.
[134:44.95]I didn't even give you guys a second.
[134:50.63]People might not have even been looking at the monitor.
[134:54.19]Oops, I'm sorry.
[134:55.81]Oh no, this is bad.
[134:56.85]I don't know which one.
[134:58.77]It could be any one of these then.
[135:03.39]I don't know why I did that, I'm sorry, I just, I don't know.
[135:08.77]Is it the middle one?
[135:10.13]Holy shit, you guys did it.
[135:12.11]I can't fucking believe it.
[135:14.97]Nice.
[135:16.95]And Malmo's leveled up.
[135:31.48]Well, thank you, Benedict Cumberbatch, for being right.
[135:33.50]They said I was right.
[135:35.42]Good.
[135:36.12]Thank you.
[135:36.44]Thanks for the help.
[135:50.69]Okay.
[135:51.89]More magic.
[135:53.15]I should just honestly replace... I mean... No, I can't do that.
[135:59.41]Okay.
[136:01.15]I'm... I'm impressed.
[136:04.41]Mighty.
[136:05.61]You've earned the star.
[136:07.49]Think of it as a souvenir of our fight.
[136:19.30]Funnily enough, Johnny's voice was voted the worst voice of the whole playthrough by a majority of German 985 subscribers.
[136:28.96]When interviewed about it,
[136:31.08]Jerma very clearly said, I just wanted to do Mad-Eye Moody again, and it was an excuse to do it.
[136:41.60]End quote.
[136:54.67]He must have really wanted that star.
[136:56.93]Now go on, get out of here, before I change my mind.
[137:01.96]Johnny's our main man.
[137:03.06]He even fights in his sleep.
[137:04.84]We'd follow him anywhere.
[137:09.39]Hop on the trampoline in the next room.
[137:11.03]It'll take you outside.
[137:12.49]Go on now, give it a try.
[137:19.04]Okay, thanks guys.
[137:33.53]50 bucks, oh shit.
[137:36.59]Mr. Purple thanks for the $50.
[137:37.85]5,000 bits, they say.
[137:42.07]When are you pursuing a career in voice acting?
[137:44.33]Never.
[137:45.29]Right now, actually.
[137:52.53]You found the star, well done.
[137:55.31]But your journey ends here.
[137:57.32]You are so gullible.
[137:59.78]Don't you know who I am?
[138:02.49]I'm Yardage, a member of Smithy's gang.
[138:06.27]Shocked?
[138:07.63]It's no wonder my impersonation of an ordinary person was flawless.
[138:13.32]Your search for the stars is worried, Smithy.
[138:16.64]So if I take the star back to him, I'll learn of brownie points.
[138:21.02]This is the way to get ahead.
[138:22.82]It's futile to try and fight me.
[138:26.10]Just hand it over nice and easy.
[138:32.77]Okay.
[138:43.04]And to think I got the star without even soiling my pants.
[138:46.96]I'm such a genius, it scares me sometimes.
[138:50.44]No wonder I'm so important.
[138:53.17]All right, everyone, listen up.
[138:54.43]We're returning to the castle.
[138:56.59]Our ride should be here about now.
[139:01.41]Wait!
[139:01.73]Come back!
[139:02.13]I didn't mean to give it to you.
[139:30.16]I can't get a free knight?
[139:39.98]It's locked.
[139:42.08]Hey!
[139:44.00]Someone's in there!
[139:56.33]Blade's late.
[139:58.21]What's taking him so long?
[140:00.81]We need to get out of here.
[140:01.97]I gotta get out of here.
[140:04.50]This is just great.
[140:06.52]Mario got up with us.
[140:09.06]Only one thing we can do now.
[140:11.28]Although we may be a little rusty.
[140:13.96]We'll have to swim for it.
[140:19.43]Not so fast there.
[140:21.03]That star is a gift to me, mate.
[140:22.39]My real.
[140:23.91]You spineless dogs have no code of honor.
[140:26.99]I'll make you walk the plank.
[140:30.24]Johnny, maybe we should have leave the barrio the pleasure of wrapping things up here.
[140:43.93]I guess we'll have to take our disguises off now.
[140:48.47]Group formation!
[141:08.76]No rest.
[141:09.50]Three bosses in a row.
[141:10.66]No rest!
[141:16.90]Oh fuck, this actually is bad.
[141:18.66]This is actually a hard fight, and he does a lot of damage, as you'll see in a second.
[141:21.94]Oh yeah, this is bad, I'm gonna lose.
[141:23.04]When was the last time I saved the game?
[141:36.10]Okay, oh good, good.
[141:41.21]Yeah, you're right, right, right.
[141:42.17]Oh boy, this is bad.
[141:43.17]Okay.
[141:44.71]Bowser, it's all up to you.
[141:58.68]Oof.
[142:00.69]What?
[142:00.87]Super jump, maybe?
[142:10.58]Now, Mario, you are not very good.
[142:17.47]Are you good, Jerma?
[142:18.25]You're forgetting things that happened seconds ago.
[142:33.65]I'll be fine.
[142:38.66]That's... You're telling me that... Okay, he must have a high magic damage blocker.
[142:44.75]I need a group hug right now, or everyone dies.
[142:47.01]Good.
[142:49.09]If Peach was not part of this party... I would lose.
[142:55.03]So... Good party swap before this encounter.
[143:05.89]Which one's the real Yardovich?
[143:08.84]That's not the real Yardovich This is the real Yardovich Yep I have plenty of FP Good thing I blocked that Nice block, Peach
[143:37.27]Come back together again.
[143:38.05]I need to keep Peach alive, so we're just gonna keep the heal up.
[144:05.48]I'm alright.
[144:06.00]I'm gonna just heal Mario.
[144:19.29]Thank you!
[144:21.36]All right, they're back together again.
[144:25.16]Whack!
[144:29.34]Three!
[144:46.12]I need another group hug.
[144:47.36]This would have been hell without Peach.
[144:49.92]I would have used every poke.
[144:51.36]Somebody would have just had been on total item duty.
[144:59.57]And that also may have killed Peach as well.
[145:07.31]Wow, not good.
[145:08.79]I actually...
[145:12.71]I'm gonna just... I was gonna use a mushroom on Peach, but no.
[145:16.90]She'll be alright.
[145:18.24]No, she won't.
[145:21.54]Alright, she would've been fine.
[145:37.00]Ow!
[145:37.96]God damn it!
[145:39.00]Stop targeting Peach!
[145:40.94]Well, I guess you're doing the right thing.
[145:46.25]Just defend with Peach, yeah.
[145:47.83]Well, no, I don't even have to.
[145:49.09]Counter's over.
[145:49.87]I win.
[145:54.79]That could have been way worse.
[145:57.98]Mario has reached level 12.
[146:02.42]Almost 100 health on Mario.
[146:08.45]Let's get... My click maps is currently disconnected.
[146:12.23]Why?
[146:15.91]Uh, that's weird.
[146:17.34]Alright.
[146:18.08]Go for it!
[146:44.25]31 to 30.
[146:44.75]Oh, it's a fight.
[146:48.11]It's a chat fight.
[146:49.28]Who's gonna prevail?
[146:50.26]The thing that we click on every single time.
[146:54.50]Or something new.
[146:56.90]By the way, that is 30.
[146:58.10]That is over 30%.
[146:59.66]That's 34%, guys, because Mario, they're overlapping.
[147:12.38]flowers at 20% oh oh no it's oh it's bullshit because there's 10,000 clicks sorry guys I didn't have the thing where you can't click a thousand times choose wisely
[147:47.49]Oh my god.
[147:52.37]How about just pick one?
[148:00.81]Wow.
[148:03.04]It's time to close it in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
[148:14.88]Fuck.
[148:31.86]Nice work, everybody.
[148:36.34]Try it again.
[148:46.75]Flower.
[148:48.43]Oh, right flower.
[148:55.59]Oh, you know, I actually kinda, I like, I like the whole, like, right flower, everyone click right flower.
[149:02.49]Because that's just a place for people who vote.
[149:05.25]We got like a nice clean, like 60% of our audience here voting here.
[149:11.18]We've distracted the people that are just messing around.
[149:14.22]So this is a really good thing to do, I think.
[149:22.95]Doesn't really matter because it's still magic.
[149:29.87]57, 35.
[149:35.19]Got it.
[149:37.93]Smithy is now in the hurries for the star pieces.
[149:39.99]A lot of horrible surprises might even store for Mario.
[149:46.92]It's the last chance I'm gonna be able to have.
[149:48.26]I'm not gonna be able to do that anymore, so... Nope.
[149:54.75]To Mario.
[149:56.11]To Mario.
[149:57.55]Knowing you, it must have been a breeze knocking down Yardovich.
[150:00.78]Eh, by the way, my pirates say they saw a huge axe flying across the sky.
[150:05.26]It's probably one of the Smithy's nasty friends.
[150:08.02]Go get him, pal.
[150:09.65]Well, my gills are failing me, so I'll be heading back down now.
[150:12.47]Drop him when I'm... I couldn't read the rest.
[150:18.51]It was shitty handwriting.
[150:32.44]Here we go, let's get in here.
[150:35.12]Hey everybody, I've come to rescue you.
[150:38.52]Thank you so much, I've had enough of cramped, dirty old places like this.
[150:42.80]Hey fella, you got us out of a bind, peace.
[150:46.18]It was mighty unpleasant in here.
[150:47.86]Thanks for helping us.
[150:49.44]Thank you.
[150:50.16]Yeah, thanks.
[150:51.38]Be sure to stop by our shop.
[150:54.94]Well thank you for freeing us.
[150:56.32]I've gotta get back to work now, but stop by at the inn.
[150:59.38]See you there.
[151:06.68]Hey Mario, thank you for saving our little town of Seaside.
[151:10.86]You exposed the fake townspeople and gave up your star to save us.
[151:15.50]Please take this with our thanks.
[151:18.79]Got a flower box.
[151:24.65]This town people all sound like fucking goofy.
[151:31.19]Five distinct voices, count them.
[151:40.63]Weapon and armor.
[151:41.41]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[151:42.83]Yes.
[151:44.23]Yes.
[151:44.73]I got 999 Geno World coins.
[151:48.60]Yes.
[151:59.85]Okay, hold on.
[152:00.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[152:00.79]This is important.
[152:01.39]This is an overwhelming amount of cool items, equipable items.
[152:05.11]Let's go with... This is a Mario weapon.
[152:07.99]This is the Trooper Shell.
[152:09.19]I think this is better.
[152:11.75]This is the Parasol.
[152:13.75]This is for Toadstool.
[152:14.97]We want that.
[152:16.35]Double Punch for Geno.
[152:18.46]Yep.
[152:19.20]Ribbit Stick for Mallow.
[152:21.70]Okay.
[152:21.82]Okay.
[152:27.93]Please come in and browse.
[152:28.71]I'm running an armor shop.
[152:29.69]Here we go.
[152:32.42]Sailor shirt.
[152:33.28]Sailor pants.
[152:34.02]Sailor cape.
[152:35.68]Nautica dress.
[152:36.40]Get... No.
[152:38.10]We're about to go... No.
[152:40.34]We're gonna go to a new town.
[152:41.93]Nope.
[152:42.85]Alright, I'll get one.
[152:46.93]Trooper Shell.
[152:47.53]Masher is currently at 132.
[152:48.75]Oh, but I'm sick of looking at this shit.
[152:54.69]It's different.
[152:55.65]It's the same damn thing.
[152:56.65]It's different, though.
[152:57.29]I don't want to see that same animation.
[152:58.71]Get that thing out of here.
[153:00.47]Parasol.
[153:00.97]96.
[153:02.13]That's much better.
[153:06.41]Double Punch is for Geno.
[153:10.55]Better than the handgun.
[153:11.51]Double Punch.
[153:12.83]125.
[153:12.89]Without an accessory.
[153:14.83]Holy shit, Geno.
[153:18.92]Rivet stick.
[153:20.30]100.
[153:20.48]Better than symbols.
[153:21.12]Of course it is.
[153:27.76]Polk address.
[153:28.38]Nautica address.

[153:48.21]Symbols, masher, handgun, slack glove, polka dress.
[153:54.23]Good.
[153:56.11]I got a lot of money.
[153:56.71]All right, now let's go up here.
[154:08.30]Mario, if it's a star that you're looking for, I may be able to help you.
[154:13.21]At the far side of Land's End is a town made up of reformed monsters.
[154:17.79]A mouse came by the other day, and I overheard him boasting about a star of theirs.
[154:22.95]I don't know exactly where this town is located, but if you follow the road, you'll get there.
[154:33.78]Good to see you again.
[154:34.94]Do you have a chance to accumulate many frog coins?
[154:39.06]Yeah, I got plenty.
[154:40.38]No, that's what I wanted.
[154:41.80]Dumb.
[154:42.60]I need one more.
[154:59.65]This is a terrible store Where are the mid-mushrooms?
[155:01.80]I thought I could have a mid-mushroom
[155:23.52]Hey, hey, hey!
[155:24.78]I'm the mushroom boy.
[155:26.60]Did you know that hidden amongst the regular mushrooms are some special ones?
[155:29.66]Unreal, huh?
[155:32.26]I'll give you items in return for those special mushrooms, but you've got to taste them to find out what kind they are.
[155:38.78]So I'll take a nibble first.
[155:40.71]I'm hoping for a special mushroom, but even if it isn't, at least I'll get a meal out of it.
[155:44.61]You have any mushrooms?
[155:47.29]Hmm, far out.
[155:48.05]Munch, munch, munch.
[155:50.67]That was just a regular mushroom.
[155:51.87]Thanks for the snack.
[155:53.80]What?
[155:57.61]Is this the way for this guy to just get free food?
[155:59.65]I don't remember you.
[156:09.99]Accessories!
[156:12.78]Oh, hello there.
[156:14.18]You were so brave to rescue us, and I'm so thankful.
[156:17.38]But listen, maybe it's time you thought a little more about what you wear.
[156:21.85]Accessorizing is a big business these days.
[156:24.81]Say anything you like here The antidote is pretty good.
[156:36.47]I already have fearless true form zoom shoes You don't really
[156:47.20]It's... pitch shifted goofy is actually a pretty good voice.
[156:50.38]What do you mean pitch shifted goofy?
[157:00.98]Pitched up or pitched down?
[157:03.54]It's pitched down?
[157:04.56]No, it's not.
[157:19.66]Five stars.
[157:20.44]Alright, on our way.
[157:27.82]Let's continue.
[157:28.46]I've got my items.
[157:32.94]To Land's End.
[157:38.94]Can you do the Trump voice for a character, please?
[157:40.82]Yeah, sure.
[157:41.52]The next character that shows up will be Trump.
[157:57.13]Oops Jumped it I want to get up there
[158:37.82]No!
[158:38.28]How do I get this?
[158:38.94]Ooh, look out.
[158:53.95]I sound like an alternate universe Ray Romano.
[158:58.56]I 100% do not sound like Ray Romano.
[159:04.54]I don't know where you're getting that from.
[159:11.04]What?
[159:13.37]We're thinking of the same person, right?
[159:14.75]We're thinking of Ray Romano, right?
[159:19.93]It's me, Ray Romano.
[159:22.15]You think I sound like that?
[159:33.43]Right now, you think I sound like Ray Romano?
[159:46.31]These guys are no joke.
[159:55.17]Peach is dead.
[159:56.27]Alright, I need to stop paying attention to the fact that, like, somebody thinks I sound like Ray Romano.
[160:00.75]Because everyone's going to die here.
[160:02.25]Like, Mario's about to die.
[160:04.31]Bowser's about to be dead.
[160:05.19]They're both asleep.
[160:06.75]This is the first death incoming.
[160:09.78]Not quite.
[160:17.36]Come on.
[160:20.94]You idiot.
[160:21.72]I want to go down.
[160:37.59]Because I want to check out this over here.
[160:39.53]There's some things I think that are possible.
[160:43.68]No, I need this.
[160:44.60]I thought that was something.
[160:48.72]No, I'm just wrong all the time.
[160:50.67]Ow.
[161:04.80]I do like the parasol.
[161:05.78]You just open it on him.
[161:26.05]I guess there's no way to get at it.
[161:31.79]This is bad.
[161:33.57]Again, very bad.
[161:34.73]I need Peach to do group hug.
[161:36.97]Or I lose.
[161:48.82]Don't kill Peach.
[161:51.92]Miss.
[162:01.68]I'm not gonna revive.
[162:02.80]Why would I do that?
[162:17.39]Peach does not have a very good physical power right now, unfortunately.
[162:33.94]Although someone's going to level up soon.
[162:35.42]Get up!
[162:35.68]I'm trying to dodge so bad.
[162:44.58]I don't want to fight these guys.

[167:31.62]I'm sorry, I said Nick's new character!
[167:40.53]It was the Yahoo.
[167:43.43]No, was it?
[167:44.61]I thought that was pretty good.
[167:46.39]You can cross the sky bridge in one of three ways.
[167:48.21]However, if you fall at any time, you lose.
[167:51.01]On the normal course, you'll make it across just by jumping.
[167:54.73]You'll get five coins for that.
[167:56.57]On the special course, the blocks will fall if your time runs out.
[168:00.23]You'll get eight coins there.
[168:01.96]On the expert course, the blocks will fall and the jumps are harder.
[168:05.80]You'll get a frog coin.
[168:07.92]On all the courses, you'll have to jump and avoid the bullet, guys.
[168:11.90]Which course do you want?
[168:14.14]Normal first.
[168:15.36]We're gonna go one, two, three.
[168:27.59]Alright, I got my investment back.
[168:31.38]Yahoo.
[168:32.24]You want to double your winnings.
[168:33.76]Get double the coins if you make it across on the same course in one attempt.
[168:36.96]The course is harder, and if you fall, you won't get any coins.
[168:38.82]Do you want to try?
[168:39.44]Yeah, let's do it again.
[168:55.18]Thank you.
[168:56.30]You want to double your winnings.
[168:57.18]Get double the coins.
[168:57.80]You make it across on the same course in one attempt.

[168:59.62]The course is harder.
[169:00.99]Still.

[169:17.33]There you go.
[169:17.75]20 coins.

[169:23.44]I want to do the harder one.

[169:30.01]Let's challenge it.
[169:31.41]I'll need five coins.
[169:32.79]Let's do special.
[169:46.34]Thank you!
[169:46.70]The audio is half a second behind the video.
[169:58.00]Why does this keep happening?
[170:00.56]No, I need to pay attention.
[170:08.93]I swear to god this happens.
[170:10.53]Like half the time.
[170:12.63]It's either that or I'm being lied to half the time.
[170:21.88]I panicked.
[170:22.54]Sorry.
[170:25.76]Okay.
[170:27.39]Let's do it again.
[170:28.23]I'll get it this time.
[170:31.97]And then I'm going for the frog coins.
[170:32.99]I'm going for three frog coins next.
[170:34.27]Fuck.
[171:03.53]Give me my frog coin.
[171:05.61]Two frog coins.
[171:25.30]What the fuck?
[171:28.38]Why?
[171:29.32]Didn't I...
[171:34.23]Oh, what the fuck?
[171:35.29]That's so infuriating.
[171:40.59]That's so annoying.
[171:41.71]I had it too.
[171:57.70]Do it again.
[171:58.08]Come on.
[171:58.68]I know I can do this.
[172:15.60]Again.
[172:16.68]Three coins.
[172:17.42]No, that's four coins.
[172:18.94]Alright, let's go.
[172:20.46]This is the one.
[172:20.86]Let's go.
[172:22.40]This is four frog coins.
[172:23.58]I need these.
[172:34.21]Thanks a lot.
[172:35.01]I'll take it all.
[172:37.21]Four frog coins.
[172:45.78]I haven't been here in a while.
[172:48.02]I've been busy traveling around.
[172:50.18]Where are you headed?
[172:51.73]Is it Monstro Town by any chance?
[172:55.73]Yeah.
[172:57.15]Okay, listen up.
[172:58.71]Look for the world where the ant pops up and proceed after it.
[173:02.51]Keep following it and you'll find your way around underground.
[173:06.76]Once there, Monstro Town's just around the corner.
[173:11.46]I'll see you there.
[173:29.82]I forgot, like at the end, I remembered.
[173:43.30]Oh shit, um, I think I poison gassed this.
[173:54.93]Mokuka!
[173:57.27]Da ha ha!
[174:13.84]I need... How much, um... 2159, that's alright.
[174:19.16]Let's do a Super Flame.
[174:22.63]Avada Kedavra!
[174:27.71]That's not good.
[174:28.29]130, there it is.
[174:32.47]Uh, what is it called?
[174:39.57]Avada what?
[174:41.25]104 fucking damage.
[175:02.99]52.
[175:04.75]Um... Just keep the heals up.
[175:08.75]I can take a maple syrup if I need to.
[175:19.98]Dammit.
[175:22.04]Uh-oh.
[175:25.48]Staticky's not that bad.
[175:38.49]Boink.
[175:41.28]30 EXP and... a Bowser level up.
[175:44.36]120, 109.
[175:45.18]Not bad.
[176:07.77]Hey, psst, what is that?
[176:09.19]Fuck.
[176:27.97]Hey chat, who's bored?
[176:29.03]Let's talk.
[176:31.01]Have a discussion.
[176:32.17]Talk, talk to each other.
[176:33.45]Communicate with each other.
[176:39.59]You should be talking to each other!
[176:41.01]What was over here?
[176:52.86]Look, I'll give you a discussion, okay?
[176:56.56]Over easy, over medium, over hard.
[177:00.36]Why would you choose any of those?
[177:04.24]Which one do you prefer?
[177:15.92]No.
[177:17.00]I need a syrup.
[177:23.02]Me, I prefer over medium.
[177:26.12]And the reason why I do I like over medium is because I don't... When a yolk gets really runny, it just kind of gets all over the place.
[177:33.75]You bite into it and it turns into water on your plate.
[177:36.21]You don't... It's kind of... I don't like it.
[177:39.07]Over medium gives a soft yolk, but still... It's almost like a gel.
[177:44.27]But it's hot and it's able to be spread on stuff.
[177:46.53]You can put it on your toast.
[177:47.65]You can dip stuff in it.
[177:53.03]Over hard is just too much.
[177:54.92]Too solid.
[178:03.49]Poison cats.
[178:12.67]Only one person got hit by that.
[178:16.25]I don't believe it.
[178:18.23]I refuse to believe it.
[178:23.05]Fuck.
[178:28.22]I forgot the ants were annoying.
[178:29.44]They do a ton of damage and they're hard to kill.
[178:33.28]Once again.
[178:41.24]Ow.
[178:49.40]Pick me up.
[178:52.09]Let's do this while we're here.
[178:54.85]Good.
[179:05.96]I don't even remember which one it was, because I had to go to the menu.
[179:09.23]God.
[179:09.89]Shit.
[179:10.91]They just spun around like crazy.
[179:13.55]Oh, another one of these!
[179:17.29]Come here!
[179:18.39]Get over here!
[179:20.16]Come here!
[179:22.20]Oh, Patrick!
[179:24.26]Patrick, help me!
[179:40.87]It's supposed to be a jellyfish.
[179:42.99]That's like half of your guys' favorite fucking show.
[180:00.93]It's not mine.
[180:33.78]good it's a free 30 experience every time all right come on I gotta hit them all with this finally
[181:10.40]Alright.
[181:12.24]They should die from the poison.
[181:13.08]At least I hope they do.
[181:20.65]No.
[181:21.49]It's not enough.
[181:41.65]Somebody else is going to level up here?
[181:44.75]Go in it!
[181:45.55]What the hell was that?
[181:54.69]I really wish I had... I might switch Malibu up for Bowser for this part.
[182:00.80]Because I really want to get like 100 damage on each one.
[182:05.50]I think that'll kill them, right?
[182:06.82]It's 90... No, I think they have 150 each.
[182:41.74]Sneak us through to Monstro Town.
[182:45.41]Hey, look, Mario's level 13.
[182:50.09]Look at that magic defense.
[182:52.13]That's the worst out of everybody that I have in the whole game.
[182:54.76]By far.
[182:57.94]Do the right thing here, come on.
[183:31.37]Well, I may as well just press power every time, I think.
[183:38.15]Can I ask a question?
[183:39.01]This is a very serious question.
[183:40.79]Is it because the POW symbol is the coolest looking?
[183:44.87]Is that why?
[184:02.52]HP is for babies.
[184:04.86]Because I want you to suffer.
[184:12.28]Well, we've got a pretty interesting combination here.
[184:24.29]Five seconds.
[184:26.05]That's it.
[184:35.75]I'm bringing Mallow in.
[184:49.91]Mallow for... Mallow for Bowser, just for now.
[184:55.85]Why'd you do that?
[184:57.67]Really?
[184:58.65]That's so irritating.
[185:10.44]Alright, let's see if we can get a couple of kills here.
[185:13.88]I don't have enough for Shocker, but how much will Thunderbolt do?
[185:21.19]Not a lot.
[185:21.67]If I can do it again... Did Shocker hit more than one person?
[185:27.84]I don't remember.
[185:50.93]Ooh, big froggy stick.
[185:53.11]Too bad it sucks.
[185:55.35]Fuck.
[186:09.08]Somebody else.
[186:09.48]There we go.
[186:09.86]Geno!
[186:15.97]Juno's kind of balanced.
[186:17.57]Magic defense is not great, but that's just the nature of the character.
[186:20.57]Am I going to play Earthbound?
[186:24.56]I don't think so.
[186:30.20]I'm not sure I would do Earthbound.
[186:43.38]Jerma, we'll let you choose one for a Sans impression.
[186:56.61]I don't... It's fine.
[186:57.61]You can pick.
[187:12.70]Stop baiting me!
[187:13.64]Stop it!
[187:14.20]Wait.
[187:14.54]Oh.
[187:40.83]Hello again.
[187:42.54]Isn't this just incredible?
[187:44.62]It really does look like the edge of the world, doesn't it?
[187:48.02]It's too spooky for me.
[187:49.12]I'm too scared.
[187:49.78]I don't want to do.
[187:50.74]I'm heading back to Monstro Town.
[187:53.38]It's safe.
[187:56.26]See ya.
[188:08.15]This comes into play later.
[188:20.34]Now this time, I'm going to do Maple Syrup because I want to do Shocker.
[188:28.16]On one of you.
[188:29.90]What's the timing on this?
[188:30.86]Ooh, I don't know if I got it.
[188:38.69]I mean, I kind of, you should kind of just drop the Gatorade symbol on him.
[188:43.01]So, I don't know when I'm supposed to do that.
[188:58.96]Watch, ready?
[188:59.70]Alright, it's not really the Gatorade symbol.
[189:04.50]I thought it looked like it for a second.
[189:05.96]It's not.
[189:22.09]Let's read a mind.
[189:22.79]I want to see what the ants are thinking.
[189:29.41]Do as you like.
[189:30.69]Okay.
[189:52.44]Pick me up.
[189:52.96]And another level up.
[189:53.76]No.
[189:54.08]Uh-oh.
[190:00.90]I think that's a star down there.
[190:02.14]I'm super excited.
[190:04.02]Here we go.
[190:23.79]Oh, I got them all.
[190:24.61]Yeah. 14.
[190:53.17]Why would I do a Sans impression?
[190:54.63]There's no reason to do that.
[191:05.12]Sans.
[191:05.52]Do Sans.
[191:06.06]Sans.
[191:10.50]Please.
[191:11.06]Please.
[191:11.58]Please.
[191:12.40]What?
[191:14.68]Why does everybody want the Sans voice today?
[191:21.00]I've never seen that.
[191:21.93]Even when I was playing Undertale, people didn't say, do the Sans voice.
[191:25.09]Do the Sans voice.
[191:33.23]Maybe if you're good.
[191:36.75]And you guys actually picked the HP.
[191:41.22]Smart.
[191:50.73]See if you continue to be smart.
[192:17.96]Yeah, you have to be good for the rest of the stream.
[192:20.24]And then maybe I'll do it at the end.
[192:27.55]Yeah, hey, Santa comes on December 24th.
[192:31.31]Not January 2nd.
[192:33.79]I've been good for one day!
[192:34.75]No, you've got to be good all year before he figures it out.
[192:43.19]You looking for a star?
[192:44.29]I'll sell you one for 400 coins.
[192:49.01]Hold on, let me see.
[192:51.97]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[192:52.77]Come back!
[192:53.05]No, no, no.
[192:53.63]Wait, did I fuck that up?
[192:54.73]He's back, right?
[192:58.40]Yeah, I got plenty of pot.
[192:59.44]I got a ton of money.
[192:59.94]He's still there, right?
[193:01.86]He's there, right?
[193:04.14]Oh, fuck me.
[193:05.10]Come on.
[193:05.52]Really?
[193:08.28]I'm gonna leave and come back.
[193:31.89]How long ago is that safe?
[194:04.01]I don't remember how long ago that was.
[194:05.09]Was it right here?
[194:09.66]It was right here, right?
[194:10.66]It was literally right here.
[194:12.30]It was minutes ago, okay.
[194:42.73]Thank you.
[194:43.66]Alright, we're fine.
[194:44.76]Let me go.
[194:54.59]Alright, I remember what you guys picked.
[194:57.83]You guys, it was... Peach was HP.
[195:01.17]I remember.
[195:02.17]Bowser was power.
[195:07.36]There we go.
[195:11.60]400 coins.
[195:13.52]Looking for a star.
[195:15.37]Yes!
[195:17.79]Thank you for the star, and thank you for the, like, two levels.
[195:21.85]Let's go.
[195:22.29]What the hell?
[195:23.03]Why did I just freeze?
[195:23.89]Oh, I didn't get them all.
[195:25.29]I have to kill that thing.
[195:26.97]All right.
[195:43.16]Ultra jump has been learned.
[195:48.04]You happy?
[195:48.42]Let's go!
[195:48.66]Like he was so pumped up.
[195:49.46]Let's go!
[196:22.50]Yo, let's go!
[196:23.84]Oh yeah, blue fucking hype!
[196:27.34]Oh wait, hold on a second.
[196:43.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[196:44.53]I get to pick one now.
[196:45.81]Excuse me.
[196:57.08]Do you know Blast?
[197:12.86]Confused monster.
[197:13.80]He just hit himself.
[197:16.16]He just tried to hit himself in the face.
[197:19.36]I'm sorry, I want you to go home and go to bed.
[197:23.17]Seventy-fucking-three.
[197:27.27]Mallow, you fucking toad wannabe.
[197:29.81]Hey, Mallow.
[197:38.44]You're a fucking toad hat with legs.
[197:42.16]Fuck yeah.
[197:43.66]You have to plus two it now.
[197:57.27]I'm gonna pee, I'll be right back.
[197:58.59]Dude, let's go!
[198:05.44]Let's go, dude!
[198:25.80]you
[199:24.92]Thank you.
[200:36.06]Dude, let's fucking go dude.
[200:50.25]I was testing you guys.
[200:51.01]I had to see if I did like a... Laugh out loud, like, boomer joke.
[200:55.25]Haha.
[200:56.09]And then I ended it with sans.
[200:57.49]I did- I needed to see what was gonna happen.
[201:00.29]My hypothesis was correct.
[201:14.16]By the way... Let's fucking go, dude!
[201:30.97]Balom Temple.
[201:40.87]For 100 coins, this shortcut will get you back to the surface.
[201:47.78]Okay.
[201:56.66]Should I take that?
[201:57.84]Where does it go?
[202:03.29]To the surface.
[202:14.67]But is it still available?
[202:15.69]I want to see if it's still available.
[202:23.24]Like, can I... I'm good.
[202:37.48]What are you guys saying?
[202:38.00]Vinny's a big Chrono Trigger fan and he loves Earthknot.
[202:40.48]Yeah, well, I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[202:48.23]My brother loves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[202:52.41]But I cannot fucking believe I can buy another star.
[203:05.02]Um, okay, what I was gonna say, no, so I can come back later.
[203:08.34]Uh, what I was saying is, I love peanut butter and jelly, my brother loves peanut butter and jelly, but, uh, my brother hates, uh, mozzarella sticks, and I love mozzarella sticks.
[203:17.13]No, wait, hold on.
[203:18.07]That's different.
[203:18.75]I love peanut butter and fluff, my brother hates peanut butter and fluff.
[203:25.19]Just because you like peanut butter doesn't mean you like peanut butter, like, the peanut butter, like, just because you like sandwiches...
[203:33.99]You know what?
[203:34.53]Relax.
[203:39.05]It's in there somewhere.
[203:39.91]You'll find it.
[203:41.78]Do you want your fortune told?
[203:42.94]It'll cost 50 coins.
[203:48.20]Oh, shit.
[203:49.14]Oh, what do I do?
[203:49.70]Hold on.
[203:50.82]Let's go!
[203:51.88]Let's go!
[203:52.46]I can't even do it.
[204:15.68]That's so funny to me.
[204:18.34]The three phases on the wall, hit them in any order and you'll receive your fortune.
[204:27.54]Alright, I'm gonna say middle... Middle, left, right.
[204:36.07]You wanna- No, we're not voting on this shit.
[204:38.19]It's easy.
[204:39.25]Fine.
[204:50.44]Ugh.
[204:50.54]I don't know why that's doing it for me.
[204:57.91]Like a guaranteed... Minus two moment.
[205:01.69]And I can just instantly switch it around.
[205:04.69]Even if it's a bad Sans, it doesn't matter.
[205:06.69]I just have to say the word.
[205:08.83]I just have to say, and it's over.
[205:13.08]I win.
[205:23.52]You guys are programmed to like that.
[205:49.86]Isn't this what I just said I was going to do?
[205:52.14]I can't do middle again, so we're going right.
[206:03.29]Okay.
[206:14.41]If you proceed through the pipe next door, you'll have plenty of good things to look forward to.
[206:20.50]Wow, sounds interesting.
[206:22.72]Cut it out.
[207:00.92]Where's Palo?
[207:04.50]Isn't there a treasure room here, if you do it right?
[207:07.38]I always thought there was.
[207:14.49]Snowy!
[207:15.41]Let's do snowy.
[207:26.92]Holy shit, that's cool.
[207:35.01]Very cute.
[207:44.23]You think that putting fishes and Doritos in your comments are gonna make me read them?
[207:48.69]No.
[208:12.93]That's a lot of coins.
[208:14.76]Double the coins.
[208:16.14]Okay, guys.
[208:17.42]I'll get this one.
[208:19.92]I'm just gonna fucking guess.
[208:20.76]I don't care.
[208:39.69]Got them all back.
[208:40.51]Don't worry.
[208:46.78]Nice.
[208:47.52]By the way, I have enough frog coins to get the experience one, which is probably the best one to get.
[208:51.92]The yellow tile will get you to the next room.
[208:53.54]Your fortune determines which room you'll arrive at.
[208:56.36]If you're lucky, you'll run into Balom and Monstro Town will be just beyond him.
[208:59.62]I'm so hungry.
[209:06.29]Wish I had something to eat.
[209:09.41]If you're lucky.
[209:20.07]Get it!
[209:22.52]Uh-oh.
[209:22.76]I don't have Bowser.
[209:23.98]I don't have Bowser.
[209:28.52]I don't think I can reveal this thing.
[209:31.74]Can I?
[209:32.06]Psychopath.
[209:40.27]I have a secret!
[209:43.28]You have a secret!
[209:46.32]I don't think I can do this.
[209:47.14]I have to run.
[209:52.92]It's the gas.
[209:54.99]There's no way I can reveal this.
[209:58.31]Unless... Thunderbolt?
[210:02.71]Let's try some... Let's just... Let's try Thunderbolt.
[210:08.12]No.
[210:10.38]No, there it is.
[210:28.97]And just beyond Palome will be Monstro Town.
[210:39.55]That was almost an uh-oh.
[210:49.80]Bob's just coming back for the Balon fight.
[210:51.32]Alright, so I need to put some Scarecrow repellent on.
[211:18.73]All right.
[211:19.77]Let's do this now.
[211:23.51]Let's get Mallow out of here for Bowser.
[211:28.26]Let's make sure somebody has a true form pin on.
[211:33.82]Mutant poison.
[211:34.72]I don't have a true form.
[211:35.52]Who has the true form pin?
[211:36.72]Do you know?
[211:39.80]Oh, you do.
[211:43.31]Let's give the true form pin to the person that needs it the most.
[211:46.55]The person that needs to be able to stay alive and heal everybody.
[211:53.45]Wait.
[211:54.33]I'm not done.
[212:05.14]Here we go.
[212:10.46]You look so tasty.
[212:12.36]I think I'll have just a snack.
[212:15.50]Just keep it going.
[212:33.57]I'll never forget a taste.
[212:35.51]In fact, I can clone someone after just one slurp.
[212:40.41]Take a look.
[212:42.37]Y'all look so delicious.
[212:44.49]Well, how do you taste?
[212:48.52]Mmm, tastes peachy.
[212:51.20]Here we are.
[213:08.41]No.
[213:10.15]I ain't gonna do it again.
[213:11.05]You all look so delicious.
[213:14.29]But how do you taste?
[213:17.03]See the developers.
[213:17.77]There's a lot of controversy on when this happened.
[213:32.52]I didn't even do it.
[213:33.60]Come on, give me some slack.
[213:37.26]I ironically did it, I ironically did it!
[213:39.48]Alright, I need to stop farming, uh, minus two, so this is gonna be the lowest rated stream of the year.
[213:48.77]Are they all asleep?
[214:16.88]Holy fuck, that was a lot.
[214:21.03]How do you taste?
[214:28.50]Always get rid of the clone first.
[214:40.27]How we doing on health?
[214:47.89]Snap out of it.
[214:48.79]Somebody.
[214:49.13]Okay.
[214:52.93]Uh, we're fine.
[214:56.20]I have an able juice.
[214:57.00]Might as well just use it.
[215:03.82]Because I need you.
[215:04.73]Let's just do a group hug.
[215:10.81]Do the ultra jump again.
[215:29.45]240.
[215:32.45]God, keep eating.
[215:33.71]Peach, that's fine.
[215:35.57]Bowser can get, uh, kill Peach in one hit.
[215:51.62]Do it again, Mario.
[215:52.56]You know what to do.
[216:06.64]No, not again.
[216:10.54]I'm starving.
[216:12.62]Time to go home for dinner.
[216:14.80]Goodbye, boys and girls.
[216:30.03]What's going on here?
[216:40.04]Trash loot.
[216:41.06]Yeah.
[216:42.16]Yeah.
[216:45.18]Oh.
[216:50.87]Hey, hello again.
[216:53.27]That pipe is a shortcut to my house.
[216:56.11]Beautiful house.
[216:57.27]Monstro Town.
[216:59.25]I'll see you there.
[217:11.30]Monstro Town!
[217:12.30]I love Monstro Town.
[217:13.16]It's great.
[217:24.30]Weapon and armor shop.
[217:27.04]Just a minute, I'll be there in a second.
[217:32.05]Oh my!
[217:32.83]Goomba, what are you doing here?
[217:37.67]Well, Bowser has been aged, hasn't he?
[217:42.89]Sorry about going AWOL on you.
[217:45.31]I ran away because I was scared to fight Smithy.
[217:48.96]A lot has happened since then, but look how far I've come.
[217:52.82]I'm managing this store now.
[217:55.36]And look, here are my little ones.
[217:58.40]Come on, show your manners and great Uncle Bowser.
[218:04.03]Hi, Uncle Badger.
[218:06.66]Although I can't fight for you, I still have some items we can use.
[218:10.79]Play with you.
[218:11.71]Find it in your heart to forgive me if I can help you get equipped.
[218:20.01]Don't worry.
[218:21.15]I'm not angry with you.
[218:23.59]I've got new troops now, and we're going to reclaim my castle.
[218:27.62]You can go on with your life here.
[218:29.68]I wish you the best.
[218:31.40]Well, I really appreciate that.
[218:36.24]What can I get you?
[218:42.49]Oh, you know what I'm getting here.
[218:49.79]Spiked Link Courage Shell.
[218:51.43]And let me take a look.
[219:00.53]Oh yeah. 155.
[219:05.75]Let's go.
[219:09.91]Courage Shell is... Mmm.
[219:17.08]Magic Defense down.
[219:18.08]What is it here?
[219:20.38]53.
[219:22.58]That's just... That's just not very good.
[219:25.87]But I kind of... How does Mario have a hundred and fucking fifty... No.
[219:35.98]He's 144 attack, why does he suck?
[219:48.09]Give the amulet to Bowser.
[219:50.51]No, don't do that.
[220:03.52]Whatever.
[220:07.47]I need some more of these.
[220:08.97]How many do I have?
[220:09.70]I have a lot of pick-me-ups.
[220:11.38]I'm never going to buy any more of these again.
[220:12.70]Okay, nice to see you.
[220:18.58]Goodbye.
[220:26.28]Feel free to rest here, the three musty fears.
[220:31.76]I remember this.
[220:41.99]Nice to meet you.
[220:43.05]I'm Gripper.
[220:46.08]I'm the big boo.
[220:48.96]And I'm Dry Bones.
[220:51.64]We are the three musty fears.
[220:57.60]He's sleeping.
[221:00.00]Boy, he sure is.
[221:03.90]Check those bubbles coming out of his nose.
[221:10.91]Maybe he can still hear us while he's asleep.
[221:13.77]Hey, you.
[221:14.87]We want to play a round of Find the Flag.
[221:18.49]Right.
[221:19.33]We'll each hide a flag somewhere around the world.
[221:23.85]Find all three flags and you'll get an awesome prize.
[221:30.33]We'll go and hide the flags.
[221:33.63]See you when we get back, Dumbledore.

[223:00.45]Time it.

[223:15.91]No, wait.
[223:17.09]Start the time when I... I... I... I... Wait.
[223:20.35]Why am I going this way?
[223:22.33]I'm going the wrong way.
[223:23.65]Hold on.
[223:24.39]Don't start that timer yet.
[223:26.44]Hold on.
[223:29.30]Where's the door?

[224:24.34]It's not his name.
[224:24.88]His name's not Reaper?
[224:36.61]Dry bones flag.
[224:37.37]All the flags got.
[224:40.51]Call it when I get back in the bed.
[225:06.73]And time.

[225:18.02]You found all three flags.
[225:21.04]Hey, you're not half bad.
[225:23.28]You did pretty well.
[225:25.67]We had a great time, too.
[225:27.11]Thanks for playing our game.
[225:29.90]In fact, we just got off lunch and you did it.
[225:33.40]Not even.
[225:34.04]We were on our way to lunch and my phone buzzed.
[225:37.42]Who fucking helped you?
[225:46.64]The grand prize giveaway.
[225:53.89]Don't forget what we told you.
[225:57.23]What did I get?
[225:57.61]What did I get?
[225:57.93]What did I get?
[225:58.27]Oh my god.

[226:07.95]Where is it?
[226:08.29]Ooh, there it is!
[226:27.25]Where is it?
[226:27.95]Ghost Metal!
[226:29.43]Raise his defense while attacking.
[226:40.53]Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[226:58.21]It's been sealed.
[227:04.90]So the super jump is your specialty, right?
[227:07.78]Those multiple jumps of yours are pretty amazing.
[227:10.82]I heard that your record for consecutive jumps stands at 12.
[227:14.50]How do you do it?
[227:16.59]Jump more than 30 times in a row and I'll give you a prize.
[227:23.65]You're there.
[227:25.35]Rumor has it that you're quite an accomplished jumper.
[227:31.20]I may be out-jumped, but you're totally out-pumped.
[227:36.18]A strong silent type, eh?
[227:40.38]Don't you dig these vibes?
[227:43.90]Don't you dig these vibes?
[227:47.24]It's really weird sometimes I hear the guy next door.
[227:50.66]He's always mumbling about a crystal and evil.
[227:54.82]Isn't a crystal some kind of shiny rock or something?
[227:58.08]I know I've seen those somewhere.
[228:18.90]Oh my, a traveler from afar.
[228:22.93]Welcome to Monstro Town, where many of our kind mingle.
[228:26.03]I'm the landlady Monstromama.
[228:32.39]A star, you say?
[228:33.69]Oh, you're here to see our star.
[228:37.74]She's upstairs.
[228:39.42]So feel free to go and take a look for yourself.
[228:51.62]Sometimes if you jump into the right places, a treasure box will pop out of thin air.
[228:58.57]Anything like this ever happen to you?
[229:01.03]These treasure boxes are known as surprise boxes because they appear out of nowhere.
[229:07.07]You think you found them all, but there are still 32 left.
[229:14.80]I've been all around the world.
[229:17.34]Almost every country.
[229:19.20]But the strangest person I met is this old geezer in Rosetown.
[229:24.14]He's really weird, but definitely worth meeting.
[229:40.19]That's the song.
[229:41.40]That's the Todovsky song.
[229:47.98]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[229:49.67]Somebody screenshot that.
[229:51.83]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[229:57.85]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[230:00.93]Okay.
[230:06.85]So what do you think?
[230:07.67]Our star is adorable.
[230:09.70]She's so talented, too.
[230:11.60]Folks come to see her from afar.
[230:14.54]Star bees?
[230:18.80]Oh, Star Piece.
[230:20.32]I'm not familiar with it.
[230:22.42]So you came all the way out here to search for a Star Piece.
[230:25.56]Must be really important.
[230:27.60]This is the last place on the land.
[230:29.57]If you can't find it here, then the only place left is up.
[230:33.71]What?
[230:35.61]So you want to go up there?
[230:37.65]Oh, you're an open book.
[230:39.49]Okay, here's what you need to do.
[230:41.01]There's a secret passage to the sky at Bean Valley.
[230:44.16]But first you must scale the cliff beyond the desert to get there.
[230:47.86]Since you're such a nice guy, I clearly introduce you to someone that can help you.
[230:54.36]Sky troopers, I need you.
[231:05.83]What was our flying time, troops?
[231:09.55]8.52 seconds, Sergeant.
[231:14.13]Skytroopers reporting for duty.
[231:16.53]Ask me anything.
[231:19.28]We are .52 seconds late.
[231:22.26]I hold myself personally accountable for the delay, ma'am.
[231:28.60]Still as rigid as ever about your rules and regulations.
[231:31.81]No need to bother with the protocol around me, Sergeant.
[231:35.17]I've got a favor to ask of you.
[231:38.64]Yes, ma'am.
[231:39.44]Anything we can do for a civilian?
[231:42.12]This fella here really wants to, really wants to get to Bean Valley.
[231:46.60]Could you help him scale the cliff?
[231:50.36]Understood, ma'am.
[231:51.45]The orders are, get Mustache over the cliff.
[231:54.11]We will succeed.
[231:56.65]We will now deploy ourselves to the cliff it lands in.
[231:59.55]Troopers, keep a tight formation.
[232:05.15]We have liftoff.
[232:09.94]They're odd, but trustworthy.
[232:12.41]Good luck with your search.
[232:15.95]Hope you find your star.
[232:25.44]No, no.
[232:26.04]React harder.
[232:29.78]React harder.
[232:32.80]Turn him off.
[232:49.95]No, it's not down yet.
[232:54.77]Don't you dig these vibes?
[232:58.60]Don't you dig these vibes?
[232:59.68]Is it down?
[233:00.08]Another little tip for you.
[233:01.96]That's how you get the key.
[233:02.92]Got the temple key.
[233:04.96]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[233:06.06]I did.
[233:06.40]I have it.
[233:08.19]I do.
[233:08.51]What the fuck am I doing?
[233:13.19]Okay.
[233:14.70]Now I'm going to go up here to meet the best character in the game.
[233:21.98]Not this guy.
[233:24.16]Who is it?
[233:26.01]Sorry, bud.
[233:26.57]The sensei's not in.
[233:29.49]Oh my god.
[233:30.71]Haha.
[233:32.49]Oh my god.
[233:35.29]Jagger?
[233:39.37]Bowser?
[233:40.91]I haven't seen you for so long.
[233:43.00]I've been studying here at the dojo under the Sensei Jinx because... To tell you the truth, I knew I couldn't beat Smithy.
[233:50.69]That's why I'm here now.
[233:52.23]Someday I'm gonna return and make you proud.
[233:58.11]Don't worry about me.
[234:00.07]I've got two new troopers now.
[234:02.31]And we're gonna take back my castle.
[234:04.61]You stick to your guns.
[234:05.97]Train like there's no tomorrow.
[234:11.65]My sensei's out right now, but he'll be back shortly.
[234:14.63]In the meantime, will you accept a challenge from me?
[234:19.23]Sure.
[234:19.51]Okay, great.
[234:21.05]Nice.
[234:21.75]You know that I'm not gonna make it easy for you though, right?
[234:36.72]Bang, bang, bang.
[234:38.26]Oh, that hurts my eyes.
[234:42.29]Every time I attack with Bowser now.
[234:56.20]Oh.
[234:57.64]No, that sucks.
[235:06.79]Terra punch.
[235:07.31]Dead.
[235:09.15]Dead.
[235:15.22]I found the solution.
[235:17.02]Every time it goes, just close your eyes.
[235:19.98]Just hard blink and you won't see it.
[235:22.46]So just go blink, blink, blink, and you won't see it at all.
[235:25.86]That's what I'm gonna do.
[235:33.89]Yikes!
[235:34.93]I guess that was to be expected.
[235:37.63]Mario, you're a top-notch fighter.
[235:42.63]You did well for your inexperience, Tiago.
[235:49.48]Sensei, have you been here all along?
[235:51.98]Hmm.
[235:55.02]You felt my ki, didn't you?
[235:57.62]Not bad for a novice.
[236:05.78]Your fighting style isn't as foolproof as you think.
[236:11.12]I'll accept a challenge any day.
[236:24.91]You wish to challenge me?
[236:31.91]Alright, let's see what you're capable of.
[236:41.14]Alright, here's the strategy.
[236:41.92]Ready?
[236:45.28]Block now.
[236:45.80]Yep.
[236:46.52]That does a lot of damage.
[236:47.40]You have to block right when you hit the ground.
[236:50.32]Got it.
[236:50.54]Alright, ready?
[236:52.40]So... Blink!
[236:53.98]Blink!
[236:54.50]Blink!
[237:20.30]Triple kick.
[237:22.40]Block.
[237:23.25]I remember these timings.
[237:25.23]They were really annoying to get used to.
[237:26.47]This shit does so much damage, though.
[237:33.09]I have to keep using it.
[237:33.98]I'm sorry.
[237:35.14]Actual, real, like, no jokes at all.
[237:38.00]Like, if you're sensitive to flashes of light and stuff, like, that's gonna happen for a while.
[237:41.88]So, seriously, though, like, take care of yourself, right?
[237:56.76]Valor up.
[238:00.68]Oh shit.
[238:03.66]I need her.
[238:14.58]Six.
[238:20.12]Again.
[238:22.59]You don't get to go twice.
[238:24.31]That's not fair!
[238:37.66]Group hug!
[238:45.24]Woohoo!
[238:53.07]Simply amazing I Guess I underestimated you you packed quite a punch But don't let it go to your head because I let you have that round Let's have a rematch This becomes very very very hard
[239:25.03]All right, you asked for it, and no crying if you get hurt.
[239:35.16]Quick silver.
[239:38.54]He missed.
[239:48.72]Good block.
[239:49.82]That would have been a one-hit kill.
[239:52.77]You see?
[239:53.17]You see what I'm up against here?
[240:03.48]That was a gamer Jupiter?
[240:04.54]What the heck are you talking about?
[240:07.54]Oh my fucking god, I looked at... Let me reach out and take 100 damage.
[240:15.61]Yeah, I'm a little underleveled for this part.
[240:21.02]I still might be able to do it, though.
[240:27.83]There's a third phase that you actually need to be, like, at least level 15 to 20 to do it.
[240:33.19]Because he will just kill you.
[240:47.57]Zero.
[240:49.22]Well... Well...
[240:59.92]Just perfect block every time.
[241:01.46]I mean, that's true, but you still take damage.
[241:04.58]And he has a move that instantly kills somebody.
[241:12.07]That move, Quicksilver, I believe is a guaranteed kill.
[241:15.33]Or it brings it down to one.
[241:24.81]You can see me through a telescope.
[241:28.52]Well, I hope you're enjoying fuckin' space.
[241:30.06]Fuck, I missed him.
[241:47.29]Didn't even need to do that, but I did it anyways.
[241:50.37]Alright, here we go, phase two.
[241:51.17]I'm gonna do, like, ten damage to him now.
[242:05.79]Fuck, man.
[242:06.21]That is actually bothering me.
[242:10.75]Blocked it.
[242:16.01]I really am trying to time the Blinks.
[242:18.17]And it's working, but... I might have to get rid of Bowser for a little while.
[242:25.43]You know what I'm saying?
[242:48.26]We're gonna have to use him as parts.
[243:10.51]Thirty-one!
[243:22.13]Miss.
[243:27.34]64 damage, what the... fuck.
[243:32.36]That really angers me.
[243:35.69]That really makes me upset about that.
[243:55.17]You're simply amazing.
[244:00.55]I simply just can't believe.
[244:03.50]Still haven't had enough?
[244:05.42]It isn't often that I have someone this competitive to spar with.
[244:09.32]All right.
[244:10.48]This match will be the one that counts.
[244:12.78]Since I'm placing my reputation on the line.
[244:23.07]I'll go for it.
[244:26.16]I need a better team, though.
[244:30.64]Sorry, Bowser.
[244:31.18]You gotta go.
[244:32.04]Like, I just can't look at that anymore.
[244:40.00]I need a... No, no, no, no.
[244:41.69]I can't.
[244:42.09]I'm not ready.
[244:43.73]I'm not ready.
[244:45.25]I'll be back.
[244:45.61]I'm not ready.
[244:58.67]Where the hell am I going?
[245:13.16]Lands N. I'm gonna go back.
[245:16.53]Wait, just, I need a few more levels.
[245:19.77]I need a few more levels.
[245:32.74]And I did say I was going to remove Bowser.
[245:35.88]And I did.
[245:36.30]I'm pretty smart.
[245:43.69]Now, go to the Equip section.
[245:48.03]We need the Work Pants and the Ghost Metal from you, Bowser.
[245:52.13]Thanks.
[245:55.33]We've got the Double Punch on.
[245:58.07]Work Pants.
[246:00.52]And the Ghost Metal.
[246:27.59]Do I need a break?
[246:29.63]I'm good.
[246:32.64]I'm good, guys.
[246:36.12]I ate a piece of salmon earlier.
[246:37.64]I could literally lift up a car right now.
[247:00.55]All right, there's gotta be I don't remember Ah, we got away Ha
[247:35.31]Caution!
[247:35.71]Confused monster!
[247:38.35]Ow!
[247:39.51]The other one!
[247:40.17]Don't hit me!
[247:48.09]What do we mean?
[247:58.10]What do we mean no balls?
[247:58.78]What are we talking about?
[248:00.90]What's going on with you guys?
[248:07.19]That was an INCREDIBLE vroom.
[248:11.33]I don't want to fight that.
[248:11.97]Get out of the way.
[248:12.95]I hate this!
[248:41.50]Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh gino blast here we go and that ladies and gentlemen is why gino is best character in the game toaster learns mute
[249:13.78]And he still has one more move, Geno Flash, Geno Blast, Geno Whirl, Geno Boost.
[249:20.21]We're talking about Standard B, Side B, Down B, Up B, Final Smash.
[249:26.47]Get on it, Nintendo.
[249:28.21]He's made for that game.
[249:29.65]That's the only reason why he made this long ago.
[250:00.21]67.
[250:09.35]More frog coins?
[250:10.11]Can I accumulate more frog coins?
[250:12.61]Alright.
[250:33.15]Yeah, let's double it up.
[250:52.58]Double it up.
[250:56.32]This is four more frog coins.
[250:58.20]You can farm frog coins here.
[251:00.90]That's pretty sick.
[251:12.01]Perfect.
[251:13.47]Four frog coins.
[251:18.25]Here we go!
[251:19.43]Let's climb the mountain.
[251:28.06]Which way is it again?
[251:31.54]Which way is it again?
[251:37.91]Over this way?
[251:38.51]I think it is.
[251:44.20]Oh, this way, I think.
[251:49.21]There it is, okay.
[251:57.30]Tenhut, all troops in positions.
[252:00.10]Mario, your mission is to scale the cliff by jumping shell to shell.
[252:21.34]Don't give up.
[252:22.24]Sure and steady does it.
[252:23.04]Try it again.
[252:24.92]It's timed, by the way.
[252:25.74]That's why I'm doing this.
[252:43.87]I can't get on that one?
[252:45.13]I know I can.
[252:48.53]Whatever.
[252:57.07]No?
[252:57.55]I know you can skip one.
[252:58.41]Maybe you can't.
[253:05.98]Oh my god.
[253:36.67]That's a pretty good time.
[253:37.63]Mission accomplished.
[253:38.27]Last time, 13.9 seconds.
[253:43.27]Got it.
[253:43.65]Frog coin.
[253:45.09]Just do it again.
[253:46.76]Ready?
[253:51.90]I can- Let me do 12 seconds.
[254:03.21]Shit!
[254:03.69]Ah, that was close.
[254:04.57]Again.
[254:07.95]That could have been probably 10 seconds.
[254:19.66]I'm hitting the shell over there.
[254:21.04]Get out of here.
[254:35.67]I don't care.
[254:36.21]I got the frog going.
[254:36.83]Who gives a shit?
[254:37.27]Let's go.
[255:07.30]That's gonna be good!
[255:09.56]Distinguishing work, soldier!
[255:11.26]Here's the next best thing, a Troopa pin!
[255:17.13]Got it.
[255:20.43]Grants Troopa confidence.
[255:24.32]It sure does.
[255:33.40]But what does that mean?
[255:40.15]What does that mean?
[255:40.93]Bean Valley.
[255:41.55]It's 20 speed, is it?
[256:07.61]What is the speed stat even for?
[256:09.27]Missing?
[256:09.99]When somebody misses you?
[256:21.76]You hate this song?
[256:22.64]Why?
[256:22.98]This is a great song.
[256:27.33]Wait.
[256:29.67]Wait.
[256:53.66]Time for a nap.
[257:01.66]Game sucks.
[257:02.74]Am I actually seeing game sucks?
[257:05.04]I don't believe it.
[257:06.54]No, you're not actually doing that.
[257:17.68]This is the Michael Jordan of video games.
[257:23.94]What, really?
[257:27.44]Crusher!
[257:41.68]So, overrated.
[257:47.00]You're actually talking about one of the best NBA players to ever live.
[257:55.15]Overrated.
[258:08.98]I'd be more invested if you did playthroughs of Paper Mario.
[258:16.09]This is Paper- This is- This is- This is-
[258:21.21]This is Paper Mario.
[258:22.77]The only difference is it's like a real game that came out before Paper Mario.
[258:27.08]You are playing Paper Mario's father.
[258:32.10]Paper Mario's dad.
[258:36.78]Everything that Paper Mario learned from dad, he learned from his dad!
[258:46.68]In fact, some would argue that dad was a little quicker!
[259:14.16]Fighting over what is better.
[259:17.06]They're all on the same team.
[259:22.37]You're on the same team.
[259:31.69]Otter Fiend.
[259:32.16]Thanks for the five community subs, Otter.
[259:34.96]Dropping five subs here.
[259:35.88]Thank you.
[259:37.40]Appreciate it.
[259:40.72]Five community subs.
[259:45.95]I remember something about this.
[259:48.26]This is important.
[259:49.82]This is important.
[259:50.50]Something important here.
[259:52.72]With either the direct... Something here.
[259:57.26]Something here.
[259:57.76]There's something here.
[259:59.07]It's very important for something.
[260:02.91]The seed?
[260:04.27]Something.
[260:19.89]There's an item that I need to pick up here.
[260:21.95]I just forget what it is.
[260:25.96]And it's the most important thing in the whole game.
[260:28.54]That is a 200 fucking damage.
[260:40.11]Damn it.
[260:41.37]Damn it.
[260:42.13]I can't ever get that again.

[261:54.29]Now I'm not going to do the Sans voice.
[261:58.26]I'm sorry, but I'm not doing the Sans voice anymore because of this.
[262:03.56]I saw some... We apparently had an issue in the chatroom here, and I told you guys to behave.

[264:33.12]Mario's a god now?
[264:34.84]Yeah, Mario's a god now.
[264:50.11]150.
[264:50.83]Goodbye.
[264:54.67]150 coins.
[264:56.19]And you got a... Nothing.
[265:00.55]You got nothing.
[265:02.57]There's something... Frog coin.
[265:04.39]There's something in here.
[265:06.16]I think this is a secret in here.
[265:08.32]I know there's something going on in this one.
[265:15.38]No, that's not it.
[265:23.68]Hmm.
[265:27.86]Maybe I'll see it soon.
[265:38.69]Free Wonka Bar?
[265:42.19]Um... You can't get Wonka Bars anymore.
[265:46.40]I don't know why they ever decided that that was a good idea.
[265:49.18]They're awesome.
[266:06.91]Yeah, some company bought them up and, like, liquidated them.
[266:09.33]Alright, here's Mario.
[266:13.15]Pretty good.
[266:13.57]What do you guys think?
[266:28.54]I'm not... Why even do it?
[266:33.76]Uh, Geno's attack is actually getting really, really good.
[266:46.92]50% clicking on the right flower.
[266:49.44]Nice.
[266:59.31]Power on Geno.
[267:02.37]Alright.
[267:03.41]I'm so happy that 31% of you clicked the flower because that's a good choice.
[267:20.73]Let's go.
[267:22.35]A hundred percent.
[267:23.87]You're morphing together.
[267:53.16]This is it.
[267:53.54]This is it.
[267:53.86]This is it.
[267:54.24]What do I do?
[267:54.64]Okay.
[267:55.24]You do something.
[267:56.22]That's the golden... That's the golden... That's the golden thing.
[268:01.86]I found it.
[268:02.84]Now, I forget what you do with this.
[268:04.02]I think... You don't kill it.
[268:06.39]What do you do to this?
[268:07.11]This is the casino.
[268:23.48]I forget what you do.
[268:26.65]Uh oh.
[268:27.03]I forget if you kill these.
[268:54.42]I think you do.
[268:59.64]Whatever.
[268:59.98]I think you do.
[269:01.82]And they drop something.
[269:02.58]Hold on.
[269:23.02]I actually am cheating right now, but that's fine.
[269:48.78]I know.
[269:49.20]I know how you do it now.
[269:49.98]I know how you do it.
[269:53.11]I gotta go back to Booster's Tower.
[269:54.41]Yeah, I remember this part.
[269:55.57]You guys are gonna laugh at me for this.
[269:58.30]I'm gonna fuck this up a million times.
[270:20.55]Remember, it's this one up here.
[270:21.59]Oh, you idiot.
[270:22.25]Hello!
[270:55.87]Once again.
[270:56.34]Nope.
[270:56.80]Attack up.
[270:58.46]They're vote-kicking me.
[270:59.48]They're vote-kicking me.
[271:02.94]What do I do?
[271:03.70]What am I supposed to do?
[271:05.61]I can't get kicked out of my own stream.
[271:07.65]This is my stream.
[271:25.44]What did that do?
[271:30.95]Did I not get it?
[271:31.55]Alright.
[271:39.36]It is time.
[271:40.04]Let's just attack you.
[272:05.30]Vote kick, vote kick, vote kick.
[272:11.74]Last time I was vote kicked from a server, I think it was when Grandpa played CSGO Jailbreak.
[272:21.54]I think this is the last time that's ever happened.
[272:26.64]I made everybody sing, and I didn't like how they sung, so I just dropped everybody.
[272:35.05]Pay attention, pay attention.
[272:35.79]Everybody watch.
[272:36.25]If you're looking on a different monitor, look right now.
[272:50.02]Wario, it's a free day.
[272:51.70]Free day.
[272:52.50]I remember that.
[272:55.41]Free day.
[273:05.81]Nice work, guys.
[273:07.33]I can always count on you.
[273:10.51]I'm probably at 999 coins.
[273:11.11]Nope.
[273:11.23]Almost.
[273:11.49]Oh!
[273:11.63]Time to grow!
[273:38.19]You know what?
[273:39.97]What do you say we put on a... label syrup?
[273:59.94]I'm so hungry.
[274:01.32]I wish I had a carbo cookie.
[274:04.14]I wish I had a carbo cookie.
[274:08.11]La-dee-da!
[274:10.23]It's shower time!
[274:11.37]There, there, my pretties!
[274:13.79]Hi-ho-dee-da!
[274:51.55]That vroom made my desk vibrate.
[275:05.50]La-dee-da!
[275:07.60]It's recycled water!
[275:10.08]There, there, my pretties.
[275:14.06]Hi-ho!
[275:14.50]Dee-da!
[275:37.36]It's you, Bliss.
[275:41.85]No, I want an Ablejuice, and then I want a Genoblast.
[275:45.67]Come on.
[275:50.63]You guys are like, oh wow, I don't like that character.
[275:52.29]That sounds like really creepy.
[275:53.62]Yeah, that's what the character is supposed to be.
[275:56.26]A fucking creepy ass motherfucker.
[276:01.52]I'm doing my job right.
[276:16.53]Triple.
[276:18.77]Better?
[276:20.31]You like that better?
[276:21.21]Okay.
[276:49.25]That was bad Mario, come on.
[276:55.57]I've never been paying attention to anybody's health.
[277:01.27]I probably should be.
[277:02.03]Who has health?
[277:05.28]Oh no.
[277:07.36]First death incoming.
[277:09.52]I have Able Juice, right?
[277:13.00]Yeah, we're gonna do Able Juice here.
[277:14.62]I have one more, don't I?
[277:16.62]I do.
[277:18.70]We're gonna give this to Princess Toadstool, and Toadstool has to do Group Hug, and then Group Hug, and then Geno.
[277:28.46]Come on, Toadstool, do something.
[277:30.86]Don't do the Mario.
[277:33.53]Do it to Mario.
[277:34.17]That's fine, too.
[277:38.47]Okay, can Toadstool get a turn?
[277:41.23]That would be nice.
[277:42.85]Come back.
[277:55.07]For a second I thought it didn't work.
[277:56.27]I was like, is that possible?
[278:12.82]Alright.
[278:14.68]Bring him back again.
[278:15.57]When do I time this?
[278:26.06]Right at the end?
[278:27.04]Or... Right when it comes out?
[278:37.87]Aww.
[278:40.43]Am I going to play Battle for Bikini Bottom Remastered?
[278:43.40]Well, after I lose in Mario RPG for the first time in 15 years.
[279:33.02]Next game.
[279:33.82]That's no, that's not how this works.
[279:37.20]Oh, I get to do the voice again.
[279:38.48]This is the guy that died to piranha plant.
[280:00.84]Yeah.
[280:02.89]It's a tough fight.
[280:03.93]They change you into all kinds of shrooms and... I would have Bowser here, but Bowser hurts my eyes.
[280:13.30]So I can't have Bowser here right now.
[280:30.58]When is Piranha Plant gonna get on Smash?
[280:35.25]Did you pre-order the game?
[280:37.59]I've got great news for you.
[280:38.75]If you didn't pre-order the game, then I'm sorry, but... I have some pretty decent news that you did.
[281:02.13]Give me turn.
[281:03.65]Gina has like 40 speed right now.
[281:07.75]I'm just fucking shocked.
[281:17.74]You can buy the plant?
[281:20.20]I- I'm not- I promise you I did not know that.
[281:22.66]I thought you had to pre-order that.
[281:24.38]I didn't know you had to buy it.
[281:25.38]I wasn't aware of that.
[281:27.14]I stand corrected.
[281:47.32]No!
[281:50.42]Nooo!
[281:54.76]Miss!
[281:57.58]No!
[281:58.04]I have to get shroom defense.
[282:01.80]I'm gonna die again.
[282:03.99]I have to get like shroom.
[282:04.95]I gotta go back to town and get anti-shroom.
[282:26.46]Somebody might live.
[282:29.64]No, not anymore.
[282:31.06]That's gonna be a triple kill right here.
[282:34.98]Nope, it's not.
[282:35.60]Somebody get out!
[282:36.18]Somebody get out!
[282:36.66]Somebody get out!
[282:37.10]Somebody get out!
[282:39.32]It's been like four turns.
[282:40.94]He's out?
[282:41.42]No.
[282:50.38]Get out!
[282:51.92]Get out!
[282:53.66]He did it again.
[282:56.35]Alright, I'm just gonna give Peach the truth for him.
[282:58.46]Okay, missed Mario, but that don't matter.
[283:00.06]Mario's... Okay, Mario's out.
[283:01.32]He's out of there.
[283:01.74]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[283:16.95]Good.
[283:17.29]I'm glad you did it to Mario, because now I can revive him.
[283:28.24]This is important, I'm going for it.
[283:30.04]I have to.
[283:30.38]Good.
[283:41.75]I have a chance here.
[283:42.85]Now we do... a... I'm gonna heal up Mario.
[284:04.32]I got it on lock now.
[284:19.43]As long as he doesn't do the mushroom thing again.
[284:20.79]Because then Peach can come out and do a group heal.
[284:39.96]Hey, look at that, group hug, let's go.
[284:47.87]All is good.
[284:49.53]Time to win.
[284:57.01]Oh, for fuck's sake.
[285:40.13]Fuck off.
[285:51.92]Everybody three times in a row.
[285:54.48]Oh, come on.
[285:57.79]That is actual stupid bullshit.
[286:00.19]Peach is gonna die.
[286:03.91]Usually, he's going for Peach every time.
[286:05.67]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[286:13.93]I have to keep Peach alive.
[286:18.99]She's alright.
[286:19.61]She's pretty much near full health.
[286:20.75]Okay.
[286:21.95]Now I'm gonna do... We're gonna do this again.
[286:27.58]Mario's out.
[286:30.32]Game over.
[286:31.54]He can't have that much health.
[286:54.64]Let's do it again.
[286:56.72]We're going in a circle.
[286:59.00]Okay.
[287:00.14]I've had enough.
[287:11.62]Goodbye.
[287:19.28]Oh, look what you did!
[287:20.80]Smilax has been whacked!
[287:23.57]Oh, I'm gonna get it.
[287:25.17]Queen Valentina told me to keep everyone out of Nimbusland.
[287:28.77]What should I do?
[287:29.61]I know I'll run away.
[287:33.81]Oh, I dropped something.
[287:40.48]What's this?
[287:41.82]It's a seed.
[287:43.54]Take it.
[287:44.96]Picked up a seed.
[287:46.60]There's the seed.
[287:47.36]I found it.
[288:03.75]And yes, you don't need to tell me.
[288:05.53]I know where the other insane thing is.
[288:12.13]I know where it is.
[288:15.70]Wow.
[288:17.66]Did you see that?
[288:19.18]It's a magical beanstalk.
[288:22.00]Big, huge, all the way up into the sky.
[288:26.24]It's the biggest beanstalk I've ever seen.
[288:29.65]Hit the block once more and you'll get on it, I promise.
[288:36.46]Sorry, the mouse had the blue dialogue, so I'm just kind of keeping with the canon here.
[288:53.27]Uh, I need... Okay, I'm alright with health.
[288:59.30]How to climb the vines.
[289:00.56]The vines are positioned from the bottom to the left to the top to the right.
[289:03.32]When you jump, you will be able to disengage yourself from the vine.
[289:06.30]Nimbus Department of Transportation.
[289:08.96]And it goes like that.
[289:12.14]It goes... I want to see what that one is.
[289:17.34]I'm curious about that one.
[289:30.46]Really?
[289:34.74]Alright, guys, we're fine.
[289:37.70]I love this area because it has the cool, uh, uh, background.
[289:40.60]Oh yeah, the fat, uh, Koopa.
[289:57.79]If you let them launch, they, I think they kill everybody.
[290:03.77]Oh, shit.
[290:04.65]Alright, let's keep moving.
[290:16.32]Flower tab.
[290:23.49]Uh, coins.
[290:24.51]I'm gonna get all these.
[290:36.04]I was gonna say, does this thing not exist?
[290:43.82]Ooh, caught it right at the end, and this one's on the other side.
[290:46.18]Oh, you idiot.
[290:58.49]How do I get this one?
[290:59.45]Because you have to come on it from a different angle.
[291:05.82]Can't come in from the front, can I?
[291:16.25]Oh my god.
[291:16.81]Those clouds.
[291:22.09]This is just you guys in chat right now.
[291:41.78]I'm trying to come around the edge, but I can't grab... Look at the shadow?
[291:46.88]No, I know it's on this... It's on the front right.
[291:50.10]Can I just... No.
[291:57.96]Because if I can't jump and get it, I'm on the other side, and it's in front of me, and I can't get to the front.
[292:08.96]Ah!
[292:09.02]Ah!
[292:15.40]Oh my god!
[292:16.60]This is gonna drive me fucking crazy.
[292:26.51]Holy shit.
[292:26.99]Okay, let's go.
[292:27.59]Right here.
[292:28.51]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[293:22.51]It's finicky.
[293:33.40]I have to get them.
[293:34.12]They're so easy, but they're not.
[293:43.22]What plane are they on?
[293:47.03]This forward plane right here.
[293:48.29]Okay, got it.
[293:50.49]Good.
[293:53.93]Here we are.
[293:54.69]This is a very good song, by the way.
[294:08.83]Alright, everybody, listen up.
[294:17.16]Hmm.
[294:27.41]Shut... Shut up.
[294:35.39]Shut up.
[294:36.13]Shut up.
[294:37.61]Shut up.
[294:40.38]Shut up.
[294:43.76]King Nimbus' condition is growing worse.
[294:46.64]This means we'll be losing our magnificent ruler.
[294:52.70]But it just so happens that I have found the missing prince.
[294:57.47]Prince Mallow, that is.
[295:02.37]Prince Mallow?
[295:03.81]Please, sir, Prince... Get over here.
[295:16.94]Well, well, it seems that our little prince has a mild case of stage fright.
[295:23.46]Excuse me.

[295:55.80]My, you've filled out a bit, Prince Mallow.
[296:00.74]You're looking fit, Prince.
[296:06.00]Yes, what is it, dear?
[296:09.95]What?
[296:10.89]You're asking me to... Gracious!
[296:15.01]You're serious, aren't you?
[296:16.83]Why, I don't know what to say.
[296:18.21]Dear me...
[296:21.40]I've made my decision.
[296:23.34]At the request of the prince, I agree to become his queen.
[296:27.56]Here it comes.
[296:31.30]Queen Valentina.
[296:32.74]Oh, it just makes me shiver.
[296:34.62]Fucking do it.
[296:39.78]Well, that's that.
[296:40.48]Back to your business, everyone.
[296:44.06]Hurry it up, will you?
[296:52.98]It's been a while since we've heard him.
[296:56.38]Can you believe it?
[296:57.86]What a coincidence.
[296:59.04]There's a prince with the same name as me.
[297:02.48]Don't we have anything better to do than hang around here?
[297:05.49]Come on, let's go and find the rest of the star pieces.
[297:18.52]Mega Glove War Fan Hand Cannon Sticky Glove Fuzzy Shirt Fuzzy Cape Fuzzy Dress
[297:46.10]Alright, this is going to take it.
[297:47.14]I have a lot of stuff in here.
[297:48.27]Okay, wait.
[297:50.15]Hurley gloves are for Mega Gloves.
[297:56.19]These are kind of jokey.
[297:59.19]War Fan for Princess Peach.
[298:02.51]Hand Cannon for Juno.
[298:06.69]Sticky Glove for Mallow.
[298:12.27]Now we have Courage.
[298:13.35]Should we just keep that on?
[298:14.26]No, just sell it.
[298:18.30]True.
[298:18.74]I'll get over here.
[298:20.64]Uh, fuzzy shirt.
[298:24.95]Fuzzy shirt.
[298:27.69]Fuzzy cape is better than... 80 versus what?
[298:34.03]71.
[298:36.07]Yeah, that's pretty bad.
[298:39.12]I think work pants have kind of out... We've outgrown them.
[298:47.38]I think it's not worth keeping them on because of the defense.
[298:57.66]I also should give the ghost metal to somebody here.
[299:01.52]What does the ghost metal do?
[299:06.38]Raise his defense while attacking?
[299:07.40]What does that even mean?
[299:09.12]I don't remember.
[299:11.06]Okay, so we have, uh, we'll keep all the accessories.
[299:14.05]Fuzzy dress, put that on.
[299:17.34]Sailor cape.
[299:17.88]I can sell all this.
[299:19.17]Rivet stick.
[299:19.67]Double punch is not good.
[299:21.43]Hurley gloves are not as good, right?
[299:25.45]No.
[299:26.93]Yeah.
[299:27.17]Dress this can be sold.
[299:31.17]Triple shell.
[299:32.90]Parasol.
[299:34.06]Hurley gloves.
[299:34.72]Double stick.
[299:35.76]Rivet stick.
[299:37.10]Sailor shirt.
[299:37.72]Sailor cape.
[299:38.58]Not a good dress.
[299:40.12]I'm going to hold on to the work pants just in case.
[299:44.84]The rest of the stuff.
[299:45.44]Jump shoes.
[299:46.80]I'm just kind of keeping them for no reason.
[299:49.88]Okay.
[299:51.02]Let's buy.
[299:57.45]How many?
[299:57.69]I have no more mid mushrooms.
[300:01.75]Five pick-me-ups.
[300:03.61]I probably should get a couple of these.
[300:08.47]You know, I feel like I haven't had a flower box in a while.
[300:10.64]There we go.
[300:12.02]A flower jar.
[300:12.74]Finally.
[300:13.00]Okay.
[300:13.16]Okay.
[300:17.44]Mmm, get rid of this mushroom.
[300:21.43]Use the flower box right now.
[300:25.25]I still need these pure waters.
[300:32.01]I can sell the pure water, what do I care?
[300:33.77]It's worth a lot.
[300:48.03]Rock candy is really good.
[300:49.53]Still have the seed.
[300:51.17]I'm not getting rid of that.
[300:54.63]This looks alright.
[300:55.58]Maybe a couple more maple syrups.
[300:56.76]Five of them.
[301:04.14]Alright.
[301:04.89]I'm ready.
[301:13.76]I used to work for King Nimbus, but all of a sudden one day Valentina told me I was fired.
[301:19.16]I just don't get it.
[301:20.28]He needs help, he's sick.
[301:28.60]We used to be able to walk through the castle freely, but I guess we shouldn't disturb the king now.
[301:34.37]Have you seen the volcano?
[301:35.47]Not yet.
[301:37.99]Ooh, the volcano's to the east!
[301:39.87]Sure wish I could take a dip in the springs.
[301:47.57]I'm watching that volcano over there.
[301:48.96]What?
[301:49.74]Star pieces?
[301:50.82]Huh.
[301:51.50]Never heard of them.
[301:55.80]Why did Prince Mallow make Valentina his queen?
[301:58.04]I guess it's because she found him.
[302:03.47]You know about the royal bus?
[302:05.07]What's the royal bus?
[302:06.77]It's a regal vehicle used only by the king.
[302:08.97]It's parked now due to the fact that he's ill.
[302:17.88]I'm going... Before we do this, I'll be right back.
[302:21.38]The hot springs are up ahead, but only royalty can bathe in there, and you don't look so royal.
[302:37.49]I want to go give the seed to the elder guy.
[302:57.88]I think it's over here, right?
[303:04.04]Where is the elder?
[303:04.82]Up here.
[303:12.32]See this pot over here?
[303:13.70]This is the elder of the town.
[303:15.79]Oh, it's the gardener.
[303:18.31]Hi, I'm the gardener.
[303:19.57]See that huge planter?
[303:21.45]I've spent many years seeking the legendary seed and fertilizer to fill it with.
[303:25.73]But I've had no luck.
[303:27.87]If only I could find them.
[303:30.13]Oh, incredible!
[303:30.65]I can't believe it!
[303:31.17]It's a legendary seed!
[303:31.63]I've been reading about it in the average garden text!
[303:33.41]These are so rare!
[303:33.95]Can you even begin to comprehend what a huge discovery this is?
[303:35.80]I spent my whole life... Hey, I haven't finished yet!
[303:42.48]Well, that's my story.
[303:44.02]Will you give me that seed?
[303:48.86]Sure.
[303:50.18]I finally have it!
[303:51.76]This is extraordinary!
[304:00.65]He has the seed.
[304:01.33]I need to bring the fertilizer.
[304:02.51]And if you get the fertilizer, something special might happen.
[304:12.11]Now, I'm going to go fight Jinx again.
[304:17.71]Those of you who remember who Jinx is, he's the guy back here in Monstertown.
[304:25.48]We're doing a clean up loose ends here.
[304:29.56]Oops.
[304:44.35]I wonder if I can beat him.
[304:49.65]I also have the temple key, which I haven't used.
[304:51.57]Let me save it first.
[305:01.53]Where is there a save point in here?
[305:02.99]Isn't there one in here somewhere?
[305:04.05]I also didn't do the 30 jumps either.
[305:33.94]Who the hell is the safe one here?
[305:43.47]Oh, I'll be fine.
[305:50.15]Hole?
[305:50.63]Hole.
[305:51.03]Hole.
[305:51.41]Hole.
[305:51.79]Hole.
[305:52.19]I don't remember.
[305:53.82]You don't actually die, though, if you lose to Jinx.
[306:02.61]You want a challenge?
[306:03.33]Let's go.
[306:08.09]Here I go.
[306:10.45]Let's see if I can beat him.
[306:17.52]Ooh, I don't think so.
[306:22.02]Quick, run away.
[306:23.73]Run.
[306:25.15]Just get up.
[306:25.65]Just get up.
[306:32.65]How disappointing.
[306:33.47]Running during the middle of a match.
[306:34.83]Come back when you've leveled up sufficiently and we'll try again.
[306:42.27]Instant death.
[306:44.19]Mario instant death.
[306:50.65]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[306:56.70]That's what happens when chat chooses levels up.
[306:58.62]Alright, I want to go back to the temple.
[307:01.18]I have a temple key.
[307:02.12]And I'm fairly certain I can do something in here.
[307:12.88]I go up here, I have to get my fortune again.
[307:14.30]Why isn't...
[307:29.84]I'm not accepting visitors.
[307:30.84]It's past my bedtime.
[307:31.85]Okay, here we go.
[307:39.49]There he is.
[307:41.49]That key you have there looks pretty tasty.
[307:45.01]You can have the key.
[307:49.71]It's poisoned.
[307:55.07]Absolute jackpot.
[308:00.65]Royal Syrup.
[308:03.29]Max Mushroom.
[308:06.87]Fire Bomb.
[308:09.78]What's the worst?
[308:10.68]Probably Pick Me Up.
[308:12.00]Or... Mushroom, maybe.
[308:17.32]Yeah.
[308:20.70]And then one, two, three, four Flower Tabs.
[308:27.13]Okay, now I think it's time that I try to do the casino.
[308:32.27]We have to go back to Booster's Tower.
[308:36.07]Wait, what am I doing?
[308:38.29]I can just leave, can't I?
[308:44.20]I just want to go in there.
[308:56.10]He can smell the cards.
[309:06.34]I have to go win a other casino game a shitload of times, I think, if I remember this from what I googled.
[309:29.18]Back to Booster's Tower.
[309:35.43]Alright.
[309:46.81]We have to make it back up to the top to go to the secret casino.
[309:54.70]And then it includes that chain chomp.
[310:17.96]Come on, I'm telling you, I'm way higher than these guys.
[310:20.15]I can run.
[310:23.21]Jeremy.
[310:24.97]Dot.
[310:25.41]Look, just get her.
[310:26.27]Just... Am I going to fight the secret boss?
[310:33.20]Yes.
[310:34.38]I will defeat, probably first try, the hardest secret, almost impossible boss in the game.
[310:45.65]In fact, I probably guarantee it.
[310:48.97]Because I'm going to have certain items that will make me very, very strong.
[311:00.92]There he is.
[311:04.64]I'm really, really sorry about before.
[311:07.24]Here, I'll make it up to you.
[311:09.12]Hee-haw.
[311:10.16]Are you having fun yet?
[311:12.66]Hee-hee.
[311:14.36]That was just practice.
[311:15.42]This time for real.
[311:16.50]You up to it?
[311:17.92]Let's go.
[311:20.32]Guess which hand the yellow ball is in.
[311:22.44]If you can, watch carefully.
[311:29.06]Which hand is it in?
[311:31.67]Very good.
[311:32.33]There's a prize.
[311:39.13]You want to play?
[311:40.03]I do.
[311:41.85]Which hand is the yellow ball in?
[311:47.50]Left again.
[311:49.88]A wilt shroom.
[311:51.06]Ooh, doesn't that... this is for the weirdo, right?
[311:55.78]The weirdo wants one of these.
[311:59.90]What's cheaper?
[312:00.50]Pick-me-up or, um, moon mushroom?
[312:06.33]We wanna play.
[312:07.49]There we go.
[312:12.83]Left again.
[312:16.13]Wilt Shroom.
[312:17.05]More Wilt Shrooms.
[312:18.81]I don't think I want more than one of these.
[312:24.07]It's wilted.
[312:28.06]Let's go.
[312:38.78]Right.
[312:41.85]Another wilt shroom I have to do it again Left hand Another wilted shroom Want to play again?
[312:54.19]I do Right

[313:16.80]Right.
[313:19.76]Mid-mushroom.
[313:23.58]Hey, cool throwaway.
[313:43.18]Left hand.
[313:47.48]More rotten mush.
[313:48.38]I don't want it, because I already have... I already have one.
[313:51.40]What's the text on this?
[313:53.14]Ew, it's rotten.
[313:58.89]Again.
[313:59.19]What the fuck is happening?
[314:01.85]I have to do this.
[314:18.39]right come on how many more do I need to do like two three left moldy mush all right
[314:49.62]Right hand.
[314:52.94]Congratulations, you deserve this.
[314:54.94]You got a bright card.
[314:56.24]All right, throw away a pick-me-up.
[315:02.81]I'll let you get into my brother's casino.
[315:05.53]Wherever that is.
[315:09.61]Got it.
[315:11.33]Got it.
[315:18.31]Bright card.
[315:19.58]A member's card for the casino.
[315:27.60]Might as well save it.
[315:28.34]Now we go back to Bean Valley.
[315:39.14]Can I do anything else up here?
[315:40.06]I'm trying to remember if there's anything else to do in Booster's Tower.
[316:09.36]Oh, come on.
[316:09.94]This is still active?
[316:11.06]Get out of here.
[316:11.78]Oh, please.
[316:23.25]That's nonsense.
[316:26.83]Oops.
[316:28.80]Oh, yeah.
[316:29.46]They have new weapons.
[316:31.20]The big hamburger gloves.
[316:32.12]No.
[316:35.24]I don't want to do it.
[316:43.74]I just don't wanna... Just do it.
[316:46.22]I don't care.
[316:48.06]I don't even want to do any more attacks.
[316:56.25]Mario...
[317:15.79]If you want to play a casino, just play the new NBA game that has an actual slot machine.
[317:21.66]For real money.
[317:24.52]You know what?
[317:25.22]Just do it.
[317:26.54]Wait, why does an NBA game have slot machines in it?
[317:32.84]I didn't even touch it.
[317:52.42]Thank you.
[317:55.82]It doesn't make any sense.
[318:14.21]I want to win my next rival far from the sky.
[318:26.87]Well, that wasn't worth coming all the way up here.
[318:36.66]How dry his mouth must be.
[318:39.98]Pretty dry.
[319:04.02]So let's get to the casino.
[319:05.18]Now I have to go back to the game.
[319:08.18]Oh my god.
[319:09.40]I just... I can't even run away.
[319:26.35]Oof.
[319:27.13]I like that.
[319:28.85]That's got a good sound to it Okay Let's go back to Bean Valley Go in there and do the thing we need to do
[320:00.56]To go in the secret casino.
[320:04.00]Ah, I'm excited.
[320:14.93]Bean Valley.
[320:30.65]Pretty good dodges right there.
[320:31.89]He doesn't sound very excited.
[320:40.21]Well, I can assure you, I am very excited.
[320:48.29]Did Jerma play Mario 64?
[320:50.00]That's all I did when I was younger.
[320:51.28]It's the only game I played.
[320:58.92]Water this one up here.
[321:02.65]Let's go, dude, let's go!
[321:05.15]Let's go.
[321:14.38]Would I ever try to speedrun this game?
[321:15.84]No.
[321:22.30]I never tried to speedrun any game, let alone this one.
[321:35.51]I told you this joke before.
[321:36.47]I was actually going to try to memorize the first 12, probably 5 to 10 minutes, maybe 10 minutes total of the Dark Souls 1 speedrun.
[321:52.64]I was going to try and learn the first at least few minutes of the Dark Souls 1 speedrun.
[321:59.53]And just do it on stream and just pretend like I was going to actually do it.
[322:09.70]Here we go!
[322:16.57]Great Guy's Casino.
[322:28.11]It's inside of somebody's house.
[322:32.24]It's a really... You really hide in plain sight here, huh, Great Guy?
[322:45.10]Please enjoy yourself.
[322:56.44]Hello Mario.
[322:58.15]I run this casino.
[322:59.89]Feel free to enjoy yourself.
[323:03.09]Business is slow.
[323:04.05]Hey Mario, wanna play look the other way with me?
[323:08.89]Ready and look the other, hit left or right on the control pad.
[323:14.00]Wait!
[323:15.64]Gotcha, I win.
[323:19.14]What a shitty casino.
[323:27.99]Let's do it again.
[323:29.73]Look the other way.
[323:31.33]Got it.
[323:34.25]Oh, you didn't get caught, I lost this round.
[323:37.09]You can have this.
[323:38.83]A moldy mush.
[323:40.53]Hey, and guess what we have to do.
[323:49.79]Look the other way.
[323:52.27]I win.
[323:53.77]You can have this.
[323:58.85]A mushroom!
[324:02.60]Ooh.
[324:06.56]I'm gonna say he's gonna go... he's gonna go right.
[324:08.92]That's what he wants me to think.
[324:10.38]Yep.
[324:10.56]Rotten mush.
[324:11.60]Uh, he's gone left a few times.
[324:14.50]He's gonna go... he's gonna... he's gonna go left.
[324:21.15]Damn it.
[324:34.27]God damn it.
[324:38.93]Same way.
[324:40.75]What?!
[324:42.22]You did three times to the right?!
[324:47.94]Oh my god, he's playing me like a fiddle.
[325:01.87]What the fuck?
[325:02.89]Oh my god.
[325:03.43]This is almost statistically not possible.
[325:31.85]I did it.
[325:32.59]That's un-fucking-believable.
[325:34.67]When do I get the item?
[326:04.36]I know you have to do this a bunch of times, like the other one.
[326:09.62]Why?
[326:10.42]I win.
[326:11.40]I have to win a hundred times?
[326:14.04]No, I don't.
[326:36.81]You have to win a 100 fucking times?
[326:49.68]Welcome to the Great Guy Casino.
[326:51.22]Wanna play the slot machine?
[326:52.42]Absolutely.
[326:52.96]Uh, how do I use- how do I do it?
[326:56.72]Cost 10 coins per game.
[326:58.46]Hit it once to start the game.
[326:59.75]Each consecutive hit will freeze one of the pictures.
[327:01.95]Match all three and you might win a frog coin.
[327:11.08]wow wow
[327:40.22]Wait, wait, okay, hold on.
[327:40.82]It's... Mushroom Star.
[327:41.32]Star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star,

[328:11.33]So now it's... There's no way I can do this one.
[328:13.81]This is it!
[328:14.21]It's rigged.
[328:14.57]So I have to jump when I see the star, right?
[328:19.57]Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[328:21.14]Oh my fucking god.
[328:46.95]It's rigged, C-OK.
[328:49.15]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[328:52.15]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[328:53.35]I thought I timed that pretty well.
[328:54.63]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
[329:19.68]I did it!
[329:20.48]I'll do one more
[329:51.22]Welcome to Blackjack.
[329:52.42]Let's play around.
[329:53.18]Let's go.
[329:53.58]I don't know.
[329:55.87]I know how to play Blackjack.
[329:57.03]Don't even tell me.
[329:58.99]Two cards.
[330:00.69]Your first two cards.
[330:01.53]Your first card.
[330:04.75]What is it, Mario?
[330:06.67]You got a ten.
[330:08.31]Okay.
[330:10.00]His second card.
[330:17.00]Six.
[330:17.58]Alright, we still got a sixteen.
[330:20.48]I will draw one card.
[330:23.80]Draw or stay.
[330:24.72]Well, what do you have?
[330:31.68]I can't see what the dealer has for the first of the... I can't see?
[330:34.90]Well, what if you have... What?
[330:43.81]I will draw a card.
[330:51.72]I have 26.
[330:52.48]I broke 21, you won.
[330:55.58]Here's your frog coin.
[330:57.73]Let's go, I'm gonna get 100 fucking frog coins.
[331:03.31]I have to just take his word for it.
[331:04.63]Alright, 7.
[331:06.57]2.
[331:12.61]Uh, I would like to- I would like to draw.
[331:21.99]I've got a 7.
[331:24.27]I'll play with this hand.
[331:26.25]Draw or stay, Mario.
[331:28.77]16 again.
[331:29.11]Well, I don't know what he has.
[331:32.69]How am I supposed to know?
[331:35.43]You hit on 16 if, you know, if he's showing like a, like an 8 or a 9, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[331:40.19]I don't know what he has.
[331:40.91]All right.
[331:41.19]I win.
[331:54.98]Just kidding.
[331:56.73]I'll take a frog coin!
[332:06.88]This is the shittiest blackjack ever.
[332:11.55]I thought I had 15 for some dumb reason.
[332:13.15]Alright, I got a 2.
[332:19.10]I think I should... I'll draw, please.
[332:21.00]16 again.
[332:24.11]Against who has any idea.
[332:27.41]I'm gonna stay.
[332:33.04]Of course you do 17 I have to stay on 17
[333:01.34]I don't know what your cards are!
[333:03.64]I don't even like this game.
[333:14.12]Give me my frog coin back.
[333:18.86]Stay on 17 or more?
[333:20.68]That's true.
[333:23.20]But if I could see his card, if he had a 10 facing up, you pretty much assume you're gonna lose the game.
[333:31.13]That gives us a chance to win.
[333:32.13]Give me another 10.
[333:33.93]Thank you.
[333:35.31]Split.
[333:35.81]Alright, am I back to positive again?
[334:02.46]Seven.
[334:03.12]I am at plus one.
[334:16.50]Alright, give me another card, make it a 10, make it 21, see you later.
[334:23.27]3, that's great.
[334:24.99]Fantastic.
[334:25.93]Okay, I'll stay.
[334:27.15]I have 24, I have busted, here's your frog coin.
[334:29.79]Alright, we're plus 2, right?
[334:48.41]Where's my frog coins?
[334:51.89]46.
[334:54.01]I was at 50 frog coins.
[334:56.27]Oh, I can't just use it for free.
[335:00.18]Actually, am I plus two?
[335:01.98]Okay.
[335:27.54]I want to go look at I think I want to go I think I want to get the xp ring it's a big purchase oh also the the todovsky
[335:59.36]Doubles experience when equipped.
[336:00.68]That's so... That's amazing.
[336:03.92]Coins is not a big deal, but I will just stomp on everything late game.
[336:07.38]It'll just be like, let's go.
[336:11.28]Or I cut FP in half.
[336:12.88]Yeah, I also have to do the fireworks and get the stone.
[336:18.17]I'm going for the XP boost.
[336:22.11]It's done.
[336:22.47]It's too late.
[336:26.45]Who's gonna wear it?
[336:27.67]Probably Toadstool.
[336:48.87]Alright, that's done.
[336:53.07]I'm going to need to have a ton of boosted up levels for the real final boss of the game.
[337:00.87]I need to go get fireworks.
[337:02.15]Now, fireworks gives you the stone.
[337:04.53]Stone then is you.
[337:05.55]Okay, so where do I get the fireworks?
[337:10.20]I think it's from Mole Town, right?
[337:21.65]Who's selling fireworks?
[337:22.81]Oh, there's Mushroom Guy, too.
[337:29.36]A mystery egg?
[337:30.28]I have no idea what it does.
[337:31.30]It sort of grows on you, huh?
[337:32.84]It's yours for 200 coins.
[337:34.02]I'll take it.
[337:46.98]You can't get inside Brewster Tower really easily, you need a strong person.
[337:49.42]Where can I get fire- who's selling fireworks?
[337:58.01]You're a hero, Mario!
[337:58.67]If it weren't for you, Dinah would still be inside that mountain.
[338:04.61]Oh, I wish I had a Carvel cookie.
[338:12.56]Welcome to my pretend store.
[338:13.64]Would you like a shiny stone?
[338:14.96]Yes.
[338:16.24]If you bring me a fireworks, you'll get a shiny stone.
[338:24.03]Who's selling fireworks?
[338:25.43]You?
[338:28.17]Pa fixed the roof up.
[338:30.25]He's singing Moeville blues and putting in a hard day's work.
[338:34.16]Ooh.
[338:46.58]Where is the fireworks person?
[338:48.75]Are you?
[338:49.09]Uh-huh.
[338:52.49]Oh, I think it's you.
[338:53.73]You like fireworks?
[338:54.43]I'm working on my very own invention right now.
[338:55.93]I've only got the sparkles down, but I ain't giving up.
[338:57.53]Want to buy one for 500 coins?
[339:00.43]Well.
[339:02.67]Don't think I went to the casino for like fucking 30 minutes.
[339:05.75]I can sell some shit.
[339:30.39]I mean that's the easiest way to keep myself out of the casino I don't think I need it for anything
[339:58.71]Yeah, there's still an item I'm not gonna beat I'm not gonna do that a hundred times Damn that's a lot of money
[340:35.51]I'm keeping these moldy mushrooms for the guy, the mushroom dude.
[340:44.27]What the hell am I gonna do?
[340:44.95]Should I just sell a Carol, Carol, Cola?
[340:56.74]I mean, it's a full recovery.
[340:57.96]That's not a good idea.
[341:00.88]Remember, this is just like Resident Evil 2.
[341:05.44]I'm going to hold on to these Karo Karo Kolas until the credits roll.
[341:09.88]I will never use them.
[341:12.60]I can get that money.
[341:31.56]It's over.
[341:34.24]Five hundred dollars.
[341:37.98]Thank you.
[341:57.28]Fireworks for the shiny stone, and then you guys are gonna get a sneak peek those who have never seen it before Welcome to my pretend store.
[342:06.47]Would you like a shiny stone?
[342:07.61]Yes?
[342:09.01]You'll trade your fireworks.
[342:10.25]Yes.
[342:11.41]Thank you.
[342:11.91]Please come again shiny stone
[342:22.30]I got it.
[342:23.58]Let's go see.
[342:24.60]I'm going to save the game so you can see what's happening.
[342:26.58]But you don't even need to.
[342:28.00]It's cool.
[342:28.62]It's all cool.
[342:37.37]Here we go.
[342:39.75]A sneak peek preview of the hardest boss in the game.
[342:50.39]Giving fireworks to little kids.
[342:54.07]I didn't even think about that.
[342:55.05]Alright, here we go.
[342:55.55]You ready?
[342:59.77]It's been sealed.
[343:01.53]Look, the shiny stone is reacting.
[343:04.35]The seal has been broken.
[343:18.24]Greetings.
[343:20.50]I am Kulex, Dark Knight of Thunder.
[343:25.89]I have crossed into this dimension to fight for the Dark Mage.
[343:31.21]But this world is uninhabitable for me and my kind.
[343:35.51]I must return to my own world.
[343:39.32]Before I go, though, I would like to challenge your strongest knight.
[343:45.54]Will you accept my challenge?
[343:49.24]Will you enter combat against me?
[343:53.39]Sure, what could go wrong?
[343:54.79]En garde!
[344:00.29]I am matter.
[344:02.25]I am antimatter.
[344:03.79]I can see your past and I can see your future.
[344:07.19]I consume time and I will consume you.
[344:41.34]That hurts.
[344:46.16]Goodbye, Jano.
[344:49.49]Mario's dead here, too.
[344:50.71]Goodbye.
[344:52.15]That was a one-hit kill from pretty much full health.
[344:55.63]And that... oh, Peach is still alive.
[344:58.83]No.
[345:27.87]I didn't beat him first try as promised.
[345:29.81]No, no, but that's not- that wasn't a real first try.
[345:34.08]I wanted you to see the character.
[345:37.30]That's not- that didn't count.
[345:38.60]I wanted you to see it.
[345:40.58]That's a sneak peek.
[345:44.79]No, I just walked in there with no armor on and just took my helmet off and said, shoot a bolt of lightning at my face.
[345:52.08]I'll be back.
[345:52.88]I didn't even try to fight.
[345:53.86]Because that's not even the party I would go in with.
[346:08.08]That is, but yes, that's the hardest boss in the game.
[346:11.73]Even the actual, true, final encounter to get the credits to roll is probably ten times harder than that.
[346:17.83]Like, that fight right there.
[346:25.20]Let's head back here.
[346:28.04]So that leaves us with... Let me see.
[346:30.08]We've got Nimbus Land.
[346:30.80]What have we got left?
[346:31.88]Let me get a look at the whole map.
[346:34.14]I think I can... How do I get out?
[346:35.36]I don't know.
[346:36.64]Back up.
[346:42.07]Isn't it, like, L and R?
[346:43.13]How do I get, like, a full view?
[346:44.29]I know there's a way to do it.
[346:54.28]Up, down, left?
[346:55.14]How do I get out of this?
[346:55.84]I want to see what's left.
[347:12.29]Ah, there we go.
[347:14.97]Alright, so... We have... From here, we've gone through all this.
[347:21.22]We're currently about right here in Nimbus Land.
[347:24.68]Nimbus Land.
[347:25.14]We've probably got... We've probably got about... Yeah, like probably another four or five hours.
[347:30.32]I would say.
[347:33.00]So what I'm going to do, I think that's probably going to be it for tonight.
[347:40.07]No, I want to clean up a couple other things, but that's it for game progression.
[347:49.38]I'm going to clean up a couple of the other small little things that I want to do.
[347:56.76]We're about 10 p.m.
[347:57.60]Pacific.
[347:57.96]We're getting about 1 a.m.
[347:59.09]Eastern.
[348:02.74]Uh, did Phylacter Lich just get 49 more subs?
[348:07.07]You madman.
[348:10.71]You've lost your mind.
[348:12.75]Another 50 subs from Phylacter Lich.
[348:16.09]Holy shit.
[348:20.84]Uh, thank you so much, Phylacter, in your insane contributions.
[348:27.30]This over here is the most, probably most fun of the whole game.
[348:33.49]There is this interesting... There's an interesting puzzle mechanic in here.
[348:39.17]Where you pick a series of rooms and a series of doors.
[348:43.48]And it's very, very odd, very interesting, cool things to do.
[348:48.18]Just this part in here is probably about an hour or two.
[348:54.90]This is probably about two hours.
[348:56.16]Maybe like an hour and a half, two hours.
[348:57.68]And then like probably two hours here.
[348:59.16]Two and a half.
[349:03.99]So I think I'd want to do this on another stream.
[349:10.11]But I'm not done yet.
[349:10.83]Because I want to go do the Game Boy thing.
[349:16.39]And that's right, and then Koolex as well.
[349:19.07]Which that might take a while.
[349:20.19]I might die a few times depending on how I approach it.
[349:30.64]Where's the game, kid?
[349:33.93]Marymore?
[349:36.23]Rosetown?
[349:36.65]Where's the little kid?
[349:39.33]Marymore, right?
[349:45.35]No, it's all the way in the beginning.
[349:53.44]And the mushroom guy.
[349:54.24]That's right.
[349:55.06]I gotta go back to mushroom guy.
[350:07.05]Where is he?
[350:07.37]In the corner over here?
[350:10.01]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[350:11.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[350:13.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[350:15.03]Alright, yes!
[350:15.99]I'm done!
[350:16.97]You want this?
[350:18.87]For 500 coins.
[350:23.48]Suit yourself.
[350:25.60]Goddammit, I need to sell more stuff.
[350:38.90]I need 500 coins.
[350:39.88]I'm about to do it.
[350:47.84]What's the quickest way you can get money?
[351:00.54]Safety badge is 250, but the ghost metal is really useful too.
[351:07.36]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm selling the card.
[351:09.74]It's gone.
[351:11.64]Say goodbye to the card.
[351:12.68]I'm not going to that casino anymore.
[351:27.04]I can't do it.
[351:27.86]I just need to go make some cash.
[351:32.85]I'm, who cares.
[351:39.44]I'm selling.
[351:41.20]Like, I'm not gonna use these.
[351:42.28]I'm not.
[351:44.62]I know it because I've got Peach.
[352:21.92]I'm back.
[352:24.12]I'll take it.
[352:24.56]500 coins.
[352:26.38]Want me to teach you?
[352:27.28]Yes.
[352:28.86]High score if you hit the shells with the stars fired from the beetle.
[352:35.91]If you get hit, recover by firing consecutively.
[352:38.15]Just do it.
[352:38.85]I'll try.
[352:45.97]What happened?
[353:05.82]Why am I getting hit by it?
[353:08.42]What's going on?
[353:10.26]Oh, the red stars are hitting me.
[353:34.98]You wanna hit them when they're highest.
[353:48.98]Am I actually gonna do this to 5000 points?
[353:50.64]I should just wait.
[353:58.28]Wait till there's a bunch on the screen.
[354:01.02]Start a chain reaction.
[354:07.51]I gotta beat this kid's high score.
[354:08.71]I have to.
[354:16.31]Shit.
[354:17.83]Alright, you gotta get the combo.
[354:24.54]No!
[354:28.10]Oh, my screen just, I guess, lagged.
[354:40.91]Holy shit, I just got so many.
[354:42.95]How many points did I just get?
[354:48.55]What just happened?
[354:56.89]I think I broke the game.
[354:58.15]I just got 146,000 points.
[355:09.28]Can I, now can I like turn it over to the kid and be like, I did this in 10 minutes.
[355:14.15]You've been here for weeks kid.
[355:25.11]I'm gonna stay in the corner.
[355:30.20]Oh shit.
[355:45.39]Nice.
[355:47.79]I gotta get as many on the screen as I can.
[355:52.83]No, no, no, no.
[355:58.26]Damn it.
[356:15.70]Okay, how many presses does it take?
[356:17.70]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[356:18.24]Okay, 7.
[356:18.48]Let's just test that theory.
[356:19.50]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[356:19.86]Okay.
[356:20.06]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[356:21.08]Why did that not work?
[356:45.42]How did I get so many multipliers last time?
[356:47.54]I have no idea how I did that.
[357:09.28]I'm not sure there's an amount of things that can be on the screen.
[357:11.30]Alright, here we go.
[357:12.80]Let me try it again.
[357:21.78]Last try.
[357:25.42]I mean, I can't really beat 146,000.
[357:26.22]More.
[357:26.32]More!
[357:26.50]More on the screen!
[357:56.05]Shit.
[358:10.54]Fuck.
[358:12.72]This music's driving me crazy.
[358:16.68]Come on!
[358:17.76]Alright, that was 12,000.
[358:18.24]What's that?
[358:21.86]I didn't even see that.
[358:22.42]What's a heart do?
[358:27.78]Oh, what?
[358:35.33]Come on, that wasn't anything?
[359:04.32]String, string, string!
[359:09.66]String!
[359:13.38]Oh, I ran out.
[359:16.96]Last, last, last, last one.
[359:20.60]What the fuck?
[359:24.14]Now does length, does time have anything to do with it?
[359:46.99]You gotta get lucky with the chain.
[359:48.15]We need a bunch on the screen.
[359:50.69]You need to get a shitload on the screen.
[359:52.21]Without firing.
[359:55.83]More, more, more, more, more, more.
[359:57.68]I kinda did it.
[360:01.34]Okay.
[360:01.44]Okay.
[360:12.63]More.
[360:12.95]Alright, this is it.
[360:14.21]Ugh!
[360:15.75]Ugh!
[360:26.87]Alright, not bad.
[360:39.47]What?
[360:39.71]Why do they hear you?
[360:40.43]Did they run into each other?
[360:48.63]Close.
[360:49.07]We're getting there.
[361:03.76]I'm running out of juice here Come on!
[361:11.64]No!
[361:22.34]Come on!
[361:22.82]67,000!
[361:22.92]That's all you're gonna give me!
[361:27.94]I'm obsessed with this.
[361:41.84]You gotta maximize the beginning.
[361:43.38]So it's 7 presses.
[361:44.40]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[361:45.22]No, it's 6!
[361:45.50]Now it's 7.
[361:52.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[361:52.98]Come on.
[361:53.26]Why is 146,000 not enough?
[361:54.12]Because it's not 150,000.
[361:56.72]That's a huge problem for my brain.
[362:34.28]No, it needs to be clean.
[362:36.28]It needs to be clean.
[362:46.30]This is the actual final try.
[362:58.31]Changes based on who's in the middle of the party.
[362:59.93]I just read that.
[363:00.77]That's pretty damn cool.
[363:12.96]Come on That was a good one What?
[363:38.89]How did that not get anything?
[364:02.71]Do it!
[364:03.09]Try shooting the corners?
[364:21.26]Oh, baby, that was fucking pretty good.
[364:31.85]Oh, come on.
[364:32.79]I'm running out of steam.
[364:33.75]This is the one.
[364:42.04]This is the one.
[364:42.68]Give me the heart.
[364:56.87]Oh!
[364:58.25]No!
[364:58.87]No!
[364:59.15]I got it.
[364:59.45]I get it.
[364:59.73]I get it.
[365:00.23]I actually get it.
[365:00.77]I get it now.
[365:01.17]I'm going to try to spread it up all the way from the corner.
[365:03.21]Fuck you.
[365:09.95]Come on.
[365:17.77]Damn it.
[365:19.01]Switch the background.
[365:19.91]Hold on.
[365:20.31]Not yet.
[365:28.46]Oh, it's never gonna happen again!
[365:29.92]Alright, I need some more to fill up.
[365:43.73]That's it!
[365:51.16]Oh, you motherfu- What?
[366:14.49]How could you not hit something?
[366:16.55]It's impossible!
[366:20.55]Statistically, you gotta run into somebody.
[366:24.25]Do it!
[366:25.59]You assholes!
[366:26.73]I have to start over.
[366:40.64]What?
[366:46.18]Alright, I'll change the background.
[366:49.23]Actually, easier to see this.
[367:19.96]Come on!
[367:25.63]That was a lot!
[367:45.08]It's so out of reach, it's not fair!
[367:53.08]Just don't shoot?
[367:53.84]Well, it's almost impossible not to, because every button shoots, and the only way you don't die, so when I get hit, right, I have to tap shoot to spawn.
[368:05.17]And every time I get hit, I have to tap it one more time.
[368:08.05]So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, right?
[368:08.59]Don't hit it again.
[368:13.14]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[368:13.32]And eventually, you kind of just can't... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[368:14.66]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[368:57.61]You've got to be... You've got to be kidding me.
[369:28.53]Is the one Wow
[369:58.88]Wow
[370:54.91]This is more different than a casino.
[370:57.33]Yes it is.
[371:34.68]It's possible.
[371:35.24]You can't dodge it.
[371:36.12]It's impossible.
[371:53.37]Good start.
[371:59.33]Good start.
[372:19.80]Just need two more bivouacs.
[372:38.53]I'm pressing this shit so fast you have no idea.
[372:46.42]I'm the fucking master.
[372:51.64]Let's get to a goddamn million.
[372:52.74]250, 250, get over there.
[372:56.78]I can get it.
[373:38.71]Give me the heart!
[374:01.80]I did it!
[374:03.12]I got you a fucking million!
[374:05.00]I got you a million!
[374:22.33]Two million My arm hurts so much
[375:07.69]Give me 2 million, give me 10 million!
[375:51.32]He's gone insane.
[375:53.35]I lost my mind.
[375:55.39]I'm gonna have two million points.
[376:17.43]It's not gonna end.
[376:21.37]I've reached the point of like no return where it's impossible for me to lose and I'm gonna get like a hundred million points.
[376:45.53]No, that's not a good strategy.
[376:46.69]You gotta get them when they're bouncing around.
[376:51.15]Like that.
[377:07.64]I'm doing this in front of the high score kid.
[377:11.43]He's just cackling.
[377:12.57]He got 5,000 points.
[377:14.43]Get on my level, you little bastard!
[377:32.40]Alright, 5 million and I've ripped the fucking ethernet code out of my computer.
[377:38.05]I have to stop.
[377:49.74]You know what I'm saying?
[377:50.36]Like, at some point you gotta just call it a day.
[377:56.10]Holy shit, it's 999.
[377:57.81]It can't even go any higher.
[378:03.33]That was max combo right there.
[378:25.03]And I thought 5,000 was hard.
[378:29.34]Once you get to this point, you just... It's just impossible to lose.
[378:44.39]Five million, that's it.
[378:46.97]I think five million is a number that is just perfect.
[378:50.23]You know what I'm saying?
[378:51.13]It's a perfect number.
[379:10.92]Get exactly 5 million?
[379:13.32]That's impossible.
[379:15.50]Actually, it might not be.
[379:18.90]No, that is actually possible.
[379:20.80]I'm gonna go for it.
[379:22.16]Good idea.
[379:43.89]Why is it slowing down?
[379:45.10]Am I just getting slow?
[379:46.10]Am I getting tired?
[379:47.54]I can't tell.
[379:49.20]Oh, come on.
[379:57.40]I didn't chain these.
[380:01.29]There it is.
[380:12.66]Go for nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.
[380:14.04]No.
[380:15.62]Five million, exactly.
[380:16.88]Five million points.
[380:28.76]3.8 million.
[380:29.08]We're almost there.
[380:31.28]This all wasn't for nothing, I promise.
[380:45.37]Get to four, come on!
[380:53.78]I just love the... I like the sound that it makes.
[380:55.86]I'm a bug to a light bulb.
[381:07.02]All right, here we go.
[381:08.66]I gotta be careful here.
[381:10.74]Five, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[381:21.61]Easy don't do too good That's pretty damn good How much is one how much is one um
[381:48.02]I have to start, like, shooting them, right?
[381:49.30]Let's see.
[381:49.62]It's like 70... I can do it.
[382:00.50]Almost blew it there.
[382:04.64]Holy fuck.
[382:05.50]Okay.
[382:06.10]It's still going.
[382:06.66]4.8.
[382:11.98]We're almost there.
[382:13.24]It's almost time.
[382:15.70]Okay, 4.8.
[382:18.75]I gotta start to shoot them on my own now.
[382:22.03]No, not yet.
[382:30.36]Oh shit!
[382:47.88]You know, okay, I understand if you have to leave.
[382:51.02]If you want to leave, I get it.
[382:52.96]I really do.
[382:53.78]I get it.
[382:54.68]Trust me, I do.
[382:56.65]But I'm going for 10 million.
[383:00.67]Get away from my internet cord!
[383:11.85]I want to see if it goes to 10 million.
[383:15.16]It might not even go to 10 million.
[383:16.58]It might break at 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 9
[383:51.18]Five and a half million.
[383:51.90]What if I do five, five, five, five, five?
[383:53.10]I'm gonna go five, five, five, five, five, five, five.
[383:55.86]What the fuck happened?
[384:23.32]I like blacked out.
[384:26.70]Okay, I like kind of blacked out there.
[384:28.38]I like my brain just turned off.
[384:29.92]55 million.
[384:30.58]5.5.
[384:30.74]Alright, one more.
[384:33.56]I'm kidding.
[384:34.04]That's 10.
[384:34.24]That's 5.5 million.
[384:35.04]Come on.
[384:58.24]See you around, kid.
[385:00.48]I'm going to teach you.
[385:13.71]Trust me, kid.
[385:14.29]I already know.
[385:22.65]I don't get anything for doing the high score?
[385:25.61]Oh well.
[385:27.49]Well, uh, that's it.
[385:30.17]You ruined his life.
[385:32.27]No, I didn't.
[385:33.99]There are plenty of games.
[385:34.79]He's probably way better than me at Fortnite.
[385:36.70]I guarantee you.
[385:50.07]He still has the Game Boy.
[385:51.09]Yeah, I handed it back to him.
[385:53.29]I was like, take it!
[385:54.49]Here you go, kid!
[385:55.97]Try to beat that!
[385:56.65]And it's just that both handles are just covered in greasy fingerprints.
[386:01.94]His screen just has fingerprints all over it, potato chip fucking hands all over his A button.
[386:08.09]His B button is smushed in, and you have to smear over it and press down hard to even have it register.
[386:24.36]I'll see you later that's the end of the stream well not technically the complete end but you know the end of this portion I do have to take my headphone up because that's all I can I can't hear any of the sounds besides that now
[386:54.40]Oh, next up is Terraria!
[386:55.94]No.
[386:59.06]So, I will see you guys, um... What's today?
[387:03.77]I'll see you guys probably on Thursday.
[387:08.91]Thursday will go again.
[387:17.10]End of the stream beatbox.
[387:18.06]I don't think I can.
[387:25.29]Time for the Terraria.
[387:27.91]No Germa all week?
[387:29.49]Hey, it's Monday.
[387:31.85]Today's Monday, and Thursday is still this week, and Friday is still this week, too.
[387:38.38]But, I love these Mario RPG streams.
[387:40.16]They are just fun to relax and just play a game I know everything about.
[387:44.08]Well, like, 90% of everything.
[387:51.28]Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[387:52.52]We will complete Mario RPG...
[387:56.30]On the next stream.
[387:58.33]But because it's probably only going to be another three or four hours, I'm going to do something else too.
[388:02.99]We might open with something, or we might open with this and close with something else.
[388:11.18]Because it's not going to be more, because this is... The game's only about 15 to 18 plus, so it's only about three or four more hours left.
[388:22.41]Unless, yeah, unless Koolex is an insanely hard thing that I can't do, which I think I should be able to.
[388:31.15]So this is Thursday.
[388:32.49]At the same time, around 3 to 4 o'clock Pacific.
[388:40.01]We will be doing potentially two things on Thursday.
[388:43.45]Finishing this up and something else.
[388:45.95]Thank you for joining me.
[388:46.55]See you guys later.
[388:47.88]Have a good next couple of days.
[388:51.31]Let's rewind back to earlier this evening.
[388:55.13]We had some subs and some bits and all that stuff.
[389:01.64]Surgilbutt gave 250.
[389:02.34]They say, please clap.
[389:06.98]I did.
[389:13.11]Thank you, holeof1zombie, for the 250.
[389:16.00]Suck a fart out of my ass.
[389:49.97]Uh, no one would buy this.
[389:52.51]You know what I thought about a while back?
[389:57.48]I was gonna do the Derma Old emote as an iPhone case.
[390:03.42]But then I realized... No one would buy it.
[390:18.02]And I know that people will say, no, I would.
[390:20.44]That would be so funny.
[390:22.18]I would open up, like, my Teespring account.
[390:25.08]It'd be, like, 11 purchases over, like, five weeks.
[390:33.59]So I was like, eh, maybe it's not worth, like, the cost to do it.
[390:42.43]I'm not sure what the top one is.
[390:44.49]I know that's a wallet down there.
[390:45.91]Those are sneakers.
[390:46.61]But what is the top one?
[390:47.49]Is it a t-shirt?
[390:49.68]Just a really, really shitty t-shirt.
[390:55.36]It's not even the right way.
[390:56.60]That's a tie?
[391:00.40]Oh, I thought the guy... I thought it was an open shirt with a white t-shirt.
[391:06.13]And that was at the bottom.
[391:07.55]Like that gross old man stomach fanny pack.
[391:14.80]I was like, why that t-shirt sucks?
[391:24.93]Thank you, though.
[391:26.03]For this.
[391:27.01]I will not be using any of them.
[391:32.31]Wait, did I save the game?
[391:33.53]I did, right?
[391:34.07]Let me make sure I did.
[391:38.37]But thank you, Holofunzombie for sharing.
[391:44.91]And power down.
[391:47.81]Also, thank you to SirK9 for the five dollars.
[391:51.07]Kevin, listen to your mother.
[392:14.84]Listen to your mother, Kevin.
[392:15.64]I know you're watching.
[392:19.01]Listen to your mother.
[392:21.23]See?
[392:22.31]I helped.
[392:24.71]Thank you to Allie.
[392:26.69]Allie Titian for the $10.
[392:29.31]Allie.
[392:29.57]$10.15.
[392:31.17]Thank you.
[392:31.53]Appreciate it.
[392:38.72]No message, just thousand bits.
[392:41.80]Thank you.
[392:44.42]Thank you, Drummajor, or Drummage-dor, for the $2.50.
[392:49.66]I had a dream a couple days ago in which I was making music and you were commentating to it with the LOL Epic YouTuber style.
[392:58.97]That made me remember what the heck happened to that I'm gonna make my own music stream.
[393:02.55]I was really looking forward to it.
[393:04.79]The Carnival stream happened.
[393:08.22]I had to pick something to focus on.
[393:12.61]And I thought that that was more interesting to me at the time.
[393:19.56]What happened to your book?
[393:20.26]You know, I've gone over what happened to my book like probably a thousand times.
[393:26.18]I ripped it in half.
[393:26.82]I put it in a shredder.
[393:28.32]I wrote like 17 pages.
[393:35.82]I copy and pasted just random parts of the book into the chat like two years ago.
[393:45.29]I wasn't cut out for it.
[393:46.03]Just not, not cut out for it.
[393:58.79]I'm writing a thesis.
[393:59.63]I'm at 130 pages.
[394:00.91]I couldn't even get to like 16.
[394:05.16]But I also was making, I was trying to like do way more elaborate stuff with Choose Your Own Adventure stuff.
[394:12.71]Writing a Choose Your Own Adventure book, you have to write, like, 15 books.
[394:18.91]That's the amount of data that's inside of one of these.
[394:24.19]And I got overwhelmed, and I was like, this probably ain't gonna work.
[394:30.49]But... I wish I could.
[394:36.88]But that is what happened to the music stream that got...
[394:41.41]uh eaten both financially and uh kind of mentally by the carnival stream all things off stream that I would be potentially working on is carnival stream until the 22nd of september essentially and then I'll be kind of wanting to do something else but hope that answers your question
[395:12.46]Thank you, Nukable, for the $10.
[395:13.57]That's a great game.
[395:16.37]In fact, I would probably put it up there with... In the top two, I think.
[395:18.19]I think that's probably one of the best ones.
[395:20.03]May even be the best one.
[395:46.31]But thank you, Nukable, for the 10 bucks.
[395:49.60]Glad you stuck around.
[395:52.98]But I have no immediate plans to play any Metal Gear stuff.
[396:01.31]But thank you.
[396:04.01]Thank you, Blue Crew, for the five dollars.
[396:06.39]Hi, Jerma.
[396:06.83]I just turned 22 today.
[396:09.13]Happy birthday.
[396:10.27]First of all.
[396:11.37]And I want to share this celebration with one of my favorite people on the internet.
[396:14.62]Been watching since your Grandpa Call of Duty videos, and you've helped me through some tough times.
[396:18.58]I was wondering if you'd ever be interested in streaming one of my favorite games, Lisa.
[396:23.34]Cool, Earthbound-inspired indie game.
[396:25.48]Anyways, thanks for everything, man.
[396:26.96]Thank you.
[396:28.69]For the five dollars.
[396:30.98]I have actually touched upon Lisa before.
[396:32.94]I have said I'm not going to play it on stream.
[396:37.14]Unfortunately, I will not be playing Lisa on stream.
[396:49.29]Play Celeste.
[396:50.85]I did play Celeste.
[396:51.61]I beat Celeste on stream.
[396:53.97]That wasn't that long ago.
[396:54.75]That was only like, what, four or five months ago?
[396:58.95]I've done that.
[396:59.43]It was fun.
[397:04.57]It was a really good game.
[397:09.52]But, um... Happy birthday.
[397:12.78]Happy 22nd birthday.
[397:14.66]Have a good one.
[397:15.18]Eat cake if you like it.
[397:16.80]If you don't like cake, substitute that for ice cream.
[397:20.88]That's what I do.
[397:22.82]Who wants cake?
[397:23.88]We got cake here!
[397:24.68]And I'm like, can I have just ice cream?
[397:27.54]And you get that fucking squinting stare like, really?
[397:31.14]Um, no, that's okay.
[397:35.29]Thank you.
[397:42.85]Thank you, though.
[397:43.65]Happy birthday.
[397:50.79]Thank you, Apple Shit for the $2.50.
[397:51.89]Hey, man, do you listen to Taylor Swift?
[397:55.19]She's my fave.
[397:56.51]And she just put out a new album, so I've got to ask.
[397:58.93]Have a great day.
[398:03.30]Um, let me try to come up with one song from Taylor Swift that I could reliably say is Taylor Swift's song.
[398:12.41]Let me try, hold on.
[398:16.87]Um, she wears sneaker, I wear sneakers, I'm in the bleachers.
[398:26.94]Right?
[398:28.16]Is that one?
[398:33.77]That's Taylor Swift, right?
[398:39.30]I don't know the name of that song.
[398:41.16]All I know is that that is Taylor Swift singing that song.
[398:43.14]I had to just decide if I was going to be able to hit her or not, and I couldn't.
[399:13.94]Um, I don't... I'm glad you like Taylor Swift.
[399:16.50]That's the only song I've ever heard.
[399:18.87]On the radio.
[399:20.49]I don't even listen to the radio.
[399:21.43]Guys, I silently sit in the car.
[399:23.57]Does anybody else do that?
[399:24.45]I don't listen to music or anything.
[399:27.99]I just sit there quietly in the car and just drive.
[399:36.91]Does that make me a psycho?
[399:41.19]But I need to be... No, I...
[399:43.73]I can't.
[399:46.61]It's the sounds of the road and the tires and the vibrating of the dashboard and stuff.
[399:58.30]Guys, I make my own energy.
[399:59.74]I talk to myself in the car.
[400:01.86]How would I ever be able to play music when I'm having incredibly detailed conversations out loud with myself?
[400:21.19]He's Patrick Bateman.
[400:22.51]No, no, people, everybody does that.
[400:26.15]You ever, you ever pull a bit of red light and you look over at the car next to you and this, and somebody is just talking away.
[400:33.90]Just their mouth is moving up and down and all kinds of, they're like really distinctively, and there's nobody in the car.
[400:40.25]And then you understand there's no music, so they're not lip- they're not lip-syncing or singing along with anything.
[400:44.61]And they don't- there's no call.
[400:47.98]They're not on the phone.
[400:48.72]No, they're not.
[400:53.38]They're not on a cell phone.
[400:54.94]No, they're not.
[400:55.70]They're looking straight- they don't have their hands both on the wheel.
[400:58.42]No- no audio coming out of that car.
[401:01.90]No hands-free phone.
[401:17.34]Why are you staring at this person?
[401:30.80]It's free phone calls.
[401:32.88]Well, good.
[401:33.58]I'm glad you all think that.
[401:34.98]I'm glad that's all what you guys have in your brain whenever you see anybody doing that.
[401:39.04]Because when you pull up next to me, I'm not on the phone.
[401:43.67]But that means everybody thinks I am.
[401:45.59]So that's good.
[401:46.67]I'm glad.
[401:47.43]That makes me really happy knowing that people will just be like, oh, that guy's on the telephone.
[401:50.95]No, I'm not.
[402:12.88]You don't do it while walking down the street?
[402:14.38]No, because the car, an automobile, is a completely enclosed space.
[402:21.54]It's almost like your own, it's like being in the bathroom.
[402:24.52]It's like your own personal little bathroom space.
[402:27.32]Nobody's there, if it's nobody in there, you can talk, you can just relax, you drive, you obviously pay attention to the road, but it's like your own little space.
[402:38.61]You're enclosed.
[402:43.31]No, you don't go to the bathroom in your car.
[402:55.27]It's the only place where you can truly scream.
[402:58.65]This person gets it.
[403:00.67]You get it.
[403:03.57]In the car is the only place where you can scream.
[403:10.17]You can be like, And it's fine.
[403:16.23]It's just you.
[403:17.95]If I do that here, I'm going to wake somebody up.
[403:32.94]Just do that on your Twitch streams.
[403:34.12]You do that in the bathroom.
[403:37.20]Um... No, I don't do that in the bathroom.
[403:45.26]The car is the safest place to make weird noises.
[403:47.56]Yeah, you can just be in the car and be like... Ain't anybody ever gonna fucking know you did that.
[403:56.09]I just did that right now.
[403:56.91]I bet you Kim heard what I just did.
[404:02.92]She's, I mean, after the stream's over, she's probably going to come up and be like, why'd you make those weird noises?
[404:07.70]And I'm going to be like, God, I wish I was in my fucking car.
[404:33.92]What kind of car does Jeremy Albertson drive?
[404:36.00]We already went over this.
[404:36.70]You guys are gonna have to guess.
[404:41.10]You'll never get it.
[404:44.02]It's so cool.
[404:49.75]No, it's not a 2009... Yeah, it is.
[404:53.51]Did I talk about this already?
[404:56.03]Did you guys already get it?
[404:56.73]Did I already... Oh, yeah, you guys already got it.
[404:58.61]Never mind.
[404:59.45]The mystery is solved.
[405:04.94]Never mind.
[405:07.64]But, um... I don't know if that will move on.
[405:10.74]Thank you to Gnarly for the $2.50.
[405:13.59]Today I learned that some of the voices from Undertale characters are sampled sound clips from other media.
[405:19.97]Flowey's voices are from Ronald McDonald, and Sans is Patrick from Spongebob.
[405:30.44]Hold on.
[405:30.80]Wait.
[405:31.10]Flowey's voice is Ronald McDonald?
[405:33.22]What?
[405:35.36]What clip of Ronald McDonald sounds like that?
[405:37.52]That's insane.
[405:49.63]Flowey.
[405:58.95]That game was really fun.
[406:01.58]That game was really just... interesting to play.
[406:11.20]Hold on, I want to listen to this.
[406:14.44]Sam's voice is sample of Patrick going, maybe it's the way you're dressed, but the A part is trimmed out and looped.
[406:22.03]Ah, shit, huh?
[406:24.95]Let me see.
[406:29.30]The way you're dressed.
[406:33.40]Maybe it's...
[406:48.64]Huh.
[406:57.59]Interesting.
[406:58.01]That's cool.
[406:59.29]Yeah, that's cool.
[407:00.49]Do they have the flowery one?
[407:01.91]What's the Ronald McDonald one?
[407:14.16]If anyone's got that one, I'm interested in that one, too.
[407:19.50]this one if this is a gnome the streams are enough just makes you aware about what would you say you're maybe you're aware of that
[407:44.53]So you guys really, really, really are having a good time here.
[407:47.57]There's a rickroll link and there's a gnome link.
[407:51.17]Thanks, thanks to this person that saved the stream.
[408:10.84]Let's see.
[408:12.02]What kind of food should we have?
[408:13.66]McDonald's!
[408:15.58]Great!
[408:16.65]I packed some right here.
[408:18.13]Let's see.
[408:18.73]McDonald's hamburgers?
[408:22.11]Yeah!
[408:23.11]And some french fries?
[408:24.67]Yeah!
[408:26.37]Don't they look delicious?
[408:27.95]Yeah!
[408:28.89]And some triple thick McDonald's shakes?
[408:31.45]Yeah!
[408:32.37]Oh.
[408:33.89]Oh.
[408:43.69]What in the name of what the fuck?
[408:46.55]You can always make good use of that.
[408:48.85]Ah, here they are.
[408:50.07]Triple thick McDonald's shakes.
[408:54.47]Oh, they're empty.
[408:57.70]You sure can get a lot in these bags, can't you?
[409:02.82]You can always make good use of that.
[409:05.76]Ah, here they are.
[409:06.98]Oh.
[409:16.24]Damn.
[409:21.18]Oh!
[409:24.56]I did that last stream.
[409:28.08]It's pretty weird.
[409:31.76]But thank you to Gunther.
[409:34.14]Thank you, Gunther Riddle, for the $2.50.
[409:35.76]What is Yardovich's favorite flavor of gum?
[409:40.00]Blueberry.
[409:42.90]Thank you, though.
[409:46.87]Thank you Gnarly for the 250!
[409:47.86]I guess that is the one that everybody likes the most, huh?
[409:53.00]But thank you Gnarly.
[410:12.49]Thank you, Gunther, for the 250.
[410:15.21]And it's the second part of the... What is Jartovich's favorite flavor of gum?
[410:22.05]And the answer is... Spear?
[410:25.15]Spearmint?
[410:26.82]Spearmint.
[410:30.38]Because of the spear?
[410:31.10]That's pretty good.
[410:50.74]Thank you, BitSlave, for the five dollars.
[410:55.22]Hey Jerma, a few streams ago I told you about how I was stuck in the base, in this base.
[410:58.64]You said you hoped I got orders soon, and the very next day I was given orders to, uh, out process.
[411:06.95]I'll be attending survival, evasion, resistance, and escape.
[411:11.47]Training.
[411:11.83]Ooh.
[411:16.73]Well, I'm glad you got actual orders.
[411:18.65]Maybe you were talking about that.
[411:20.39]So...
[411:24.59]I wonder how intensive that is.
[411:27.97]Survival, evasion, resistance, escape.
[411:29.39]Well, good luck with it, whatever it is.
[411:33.33]And then they say, by the way, will you please play League of Legends?
[411:36.35]No.
[411:42.30]Somebody could knock on this back door here with like a briefcase full of like 50 grand in it.
[411:48.37]And all I had to do was play League of Legends and understand the whole game and understand all the champions.
[411:57.67]And play at a level that I was at least competent in knowing how to do everything.
[412:04.67]I would slowly close the door and come back and sit up.
[412:09.14]I wouldn't do it.
[412:11.13]That would take me, you know, if I had to put in like a hundred hours to like know everything about every champion, I wouldn't do it.
[412:19.36]I wouldn't do that for fucking 50 grand.
[412:31.83]That sounds like, that sounds really, really, really like entitled.
[412:38.78]I wouldn't play a game for 50 grand.
[412:46.12]I have no interest at all.
[412:48.18]But here's another thing though.
[412:49.80]I have no interest in farming either.
[412:53.28]If somebody was like, hey, I'll give you 50 grand if you learn how to plant all these carrots and corn and shit and learn how to milk cows and run my farm.
[413:01.10]I'm going to be like, dude, I don't want to do that.
[413:03.18]I don't even know, where am I going to start?
[413:12.08]It would take as long to learn every recommended perfect meta build for every champion.
[413:19.39]It would take the same amount of time to learn how to run a farm.
[413:29.58]I could probably learn how to run a farm in $300 to $500.
[413:33.28]I could probably learn how to
[413:41.44]I could, you know, think about it like class.
[413:45.02]If somebody would teach me how to plant every crop, it would probably be about 500 hours of me knowing how to do it.
[413:54.50]Would I be any good at it?
[413:55.74]No.
[413:57.25]Still takes an extensive amount of knowledge and skill to be able to run a farm.
[414:05.31]Takes... You know.
[414:09.50]Become an outdoor IRL farmer.
[414:12.00]I don't think I'm good.
[414:15.67]Every crop.
[414:24.06]Farming is way more useful.
[414:25.84]You know what?
[414:26.26]Now that I think about it, I would take that.
[414:28.78]I would take 50 grand to go be a farmer because that's, yeah, that is incredibly useful.
[414:35.63]I would tell the guy trying to offer me 50 grand to play League of Legends.
[414:38.39]I'd be like, can you just go make a farm?
[414:39.85]Pay somebody to make a farm.
[414:43.08]Go grow some almonds somewhere.
[414:56.32]What is the cutoff for the magazine submissions?
[414:58.22]Okay, so let me... I gotta go over this.
[414:59.94]This is actually really important.
[415:03.22]There is...
[415:06.03]No cutoff yet.
[415:08.33]There is no cutoff for those submissions at the moment.
[415:11.23]Because I need to place that somewhere.
[415:13.47]So there is not a cutoff yet.
[415:15.14]That's not tomorrow.
[415:17.84]Because remember I told you last week that I was going to have to move it again because of all this other stuff?
[415:22.10]So... That is not accurate.
[415:26.84]We're just going to keep those submissions open for now.
[415:30.97]Until I can get a real date.
[415:38.99]Somebody said, wait, when is this?
[415:40.99]We don't have a date yet.
[415:43.24]It was going to be... The submissions deadline was going to be tomorrow.
[415:47.04]But it's just going to be open for a little bit.
[415:49.26]So take your time.
[415:50.88]It's not going to be closing on, like, tomorrow or the next day or something.
[415:54.62]It'll probably end up closing at some point, like, next week.
[415:57.45]And we'll do it, like, the week after.
[415:58.65]It's going to happen before the carnival stream.
[416:02.33]But... I kind of haven't been able to focus on it.
[416:06.99]What am I talking about?
[416:07.77]I'm talking about the Activity Book stream.
[416:10.89]In the Discord right now, there are a series of channels under Activity Book.
[416:15.97]Dot to Dot, Where's Waldo, Brain Teasers, Jokes, and the like.
[416:25.54]What you can do is you can go there and submit a community themed image in one of those categories.
[416:38.43]I'm going to compile a bunch of them.
[416:45.64]To have about, you know, 5 to 10, maybe 10 plus dot to dots.
[416:51.24]Where's Waldo images.
[416:52.60]And we're going to do a community themed activity book on stream.
[416:55.93]I'm going to do it on stream.
[416:58.17]There'll be coloring book pages that are going to be in there.
[417:01.05]It's just going to be a neat little thing that we're going to do.
[417:07.95]How are we going to be picking the ones to use on the stream?
[417:10.75]We are going to just kind of pick by our discretion.
[417:14.83]So we're going to try to find the ones that are... Obviously, let's say we do 10 to 20 dot to dots or like 10 to 20 Where's Waldo images.
[417:24.14]And Where's Waldo, by the way, if you don't know, it's where you have an incredibly detailed potential image where you have to hide me in it and I have to find it.
[417:37.00]So that's still up in the air.
[417:38.68]Just, if you're working on something for it, if you want to have something for it, I will have a real, actual, hard date here soon.
[417:45.42]I just have not been able to put any real time into it.
[417:51.75]He does scream in the car.
[417:53.01]Yeah, like, this one time, we were going out, and I was so excited.
[418:01.33]We got to a red light, and I waited for somebody to pull up next to me, and I was like...
[418:06.03]Yabba dabba doo!
[418:06.81]Does he scream in the bathroom?
[418:15.58]I do not scream in the bathroom, okay?
[418:22.08]Unless it's a yabba dabba doo scenario.
[418:30.93]Anyways.
[418:32.55]We're gonna move on.
[418:35.05]Thank you to bbbbbbird for the five dollars.
[418:40.51]Hey German, much love from Australia.
[418:42.29]Unfortunately, the Sans voice is, uh... Alright, well thanks for the five dollars.
[418:48.31]Appreciate it.
[418:51.15]I, uh... The Avid Avidu scenario equals pee pants moment.
[419:00.72]I have lots of pee pants moments.
[419:11.23]You've been live for seven hours.
[419:12.27]You should have consumed six gallons of water by now.
[419:14.71]Did you do it?
[419:19.11]Get out of here.
[419:26.38]Hey, Demons V, thanks for the three bucks.
[419:30.06]I like Mario RPG Attitude.
[419:32.32]I think they're very, very good games.
[419:34.46]This one is a very good game.
[419:36.02]Singular.
[419:47.10]Just don't drink it from the Berkey.
[419:49.02]Oh, God.
[419:51.48]That device is actually pretty good.
[419:53.98]I really don't want to have to say this again.
[419:56.86]It's not bad.
[420:01.42]Uh, this next one is NoodleIsBadAtGamingForThreeDolls.
[420:03.90]Thank you, Noodle.
[420:04.42]And they say, I made a funny meme.
[420:05.87]What do you mean you made a funny meme?
[420:07.09]What's that?
[420:14.57]Uh, it's... Okay.
[420:17.99]It's a me adds sans to you eat ass.
[420:33.64]It's a second long.
[420:35.20]You just click it. ...
[421:00.23]Show us how it would look if we saw you screaming in the car.
[421:02.61]No, I'm not doing it.
[421:13.09]Smelly boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[421:15.59]Here, just the first minute, you don't have to play this on stream.
[421:18.67]This is the best Trump impression I've ever heard.
[421:20.81]I really can't stand your Stephen Colbert Trump.
[421:26.92]My Trump is not Stephen Colbert Trump.
[421:29.18]His boy better than that.
[421:37.32]Trying to make some metal with the tiny.
[421:38.93]He says, he says, hey, it's me, Donald.
[421:40.69]I'm just trying to listen.
[421:42.63]And let me tell you something.
[421:48.73]I was, I was trying to find.
[421:53.56]That's the same.
[421:54.34]I've heard that.
[421:54.66]I heard the same thing.
[422:00.33]In fact, I said it at the same time, and it was in both of my ears, and I heard the same voice.
[422:10.76]I don't know what you're talking about.
[422:18.51]Hey, beloved Mario RPG, you should play more comfy games like this.
[422:21.21]I probably will.
[422:31.55]No, Stephen Colbert.
[422:33.01]Stephen Colbert Trump is like this.
[422:36.42]He goes like this.
[422:39.18]It's me, Stephen Colbert, doing the Stephen Colbert Trump.
[422:45.00]I'm sorry.
[422:45.91]Mine's a lot more nuanced than that.
[422:53.23]My Trump is a little like this.
[422:55.97]He said... Hold on.
[423:01.16]Don't
[423:02.38]I don't put my hands in the air and wave them around like this.
[423:06.83]Well, you can't see.
[423:08.69]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[423:15.72]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[423:16.82]Hold on.
[423:17.60]We're going to put this to rest right now.
[423:40.98]Oh, that's a good Trump.
[423:41.66]That's a good Trump.
[423:43.36]That's a good Trump.
[423:44.78]That's not Trump.
[423:45.56]Hold on.
[423:45.96]If you think that's even close to what I did.
[424:06.87]Where's Pumbaa?
[424:08.28]Get to the part with the rapping and the music, okay?
[424:14.22]I don't have time to do this.
[424:16.16]I can't believe this thing won a Tony.
[424:22.30]I can't believe this thing won a Tony.
[424:25.68]I can't believe this thing won a Tony.
[424:27.35]Not even close.
[424:43.76]Your Stephen Colbert doing a Trump impression is better than the actual impression.
[424:59.35]No, it's not.
[425:00.95]No way.
[425:06.89]My fucking ego.
[425:08.93]Shit, that was like 20 damage.
[425:11.22]It's all right.
[425:28.96]Let me tell you, believe me.
[425:35.62]I never claim to be an impressionist.
[425:37.44]I just claim to be incredibly gifted at doing other people's voices.
[425:41.80]Oh, fuck.
[425:45.72]I'm fine.
[425:53.05]Have I seen the tongs?
[425:53.81]I don't know where the tongs are.
[425:55.01]That's a good question.
[425:55.93]I will come down and help you look in a minute.
[426:00.51]Phylacter Lich also gave an insane amount of subs.
[426:03.01]Let's go ahead and put them on screen.
[426:05.61]Because, I mean, it was 49 gifted subs.
[426:10.92]They're gonna fly by.
[426:12.00]Here they are.
[426:13.48]Thank you, everybody, for the subs.
[426:24.14]Thanks for new subs, old subs, community subs.
[426:28.07]If you stuck with this channel for the last four years, or if you just found the channel literally last night.
[426:34.75]Thank you.
[426:40.23]Have a great next couple days.
[426:42.60]See you guys on Thursday.
[426:49.96]We have two more bits to go through.
[426:52.92]Much love to all of you.
[426:53.60]Thank you.
[426:56.69]Gonder Lane, thanks for the 250.
[426:59.85]Have you heard of Limbo of the Lost?
[427:01.79]It's a really horrible point-and-click that's infamous for using stolen assets from a dozen games.
[427:07.01]Yet it has its charm of being so bad, it's good.
[427:09.27]It's free to download because it's also been abandoned.
[427:12.86]But it still has the reputation of the worst point-and-click game that has ever existed.
[427:16.68]Please play it.
[427:18.40]It'll do us all a good favor.
[427:23.22]Um... Maybe...
[427:27.29]I do want to do another FMV night.
[427:29.17]Because there's at least a handful of FMV games that I have not played that I would like to play.
[427:37.97]So you will absolutely see me play a bunch of FMV games, although I don't know if that's also an FMV game.
[427:48.60]I do want to play Ripper.
[427:54.32]That should be fun.
[427:57.82]Also, at the very end, thank you to Flugboy.
[428:02.36]For the $5.
[428:03.18]Hey, hope you're doing well.
[428:03.91]Jeremy was waiting to ask you, wanted to ask you something.
[428:07.89]Now, I know you like newer shit like the Gorillaz, but do you like any old school music like the Beatles, Deep Purple Prince, etc.?
[428:15.27]Um... Yeah, I do.
[428:25.14]But I kind of just...
[428:27.68]I don't, like, go, I don't have any Beatles albums, but if the Beatles are on the radio, when, you know, I'm not fucking talking, I'm doing a monologue in the car, if the Beatles are on somewhere, I'll point up and go, oh, the Beatles are on here.
[428:44.19]Guys, I get most of my music media consumption from the inside of a grocery store.
[428:53.81]Or whatever's playing in the mall.
[428:58.07]And if, you know, you're walking around and you're buying some jeans at Old Navy, and you hear, um... You hear, like, fucking Prince on the radio, you look up and you go, Oh, alright, Prince.
[429:11.87]Nice.
[429:13.99]And then I go back to buying jeans.
[429:19.02]But, I mean, I do, I do, I like music, I just don't really listen to a lot of music.
[429:32.47]Jerma is confirmed an NPC.
[429:35.77]I'm not an NPC.
[429:36.27]What do you mean NPC?
[429:38.71]I'm a playable character.
[429:40.43]Alright?
[429:46.78]What do you mean?
[429:48.22]What does that mean?
[429:48.90]True?
[429:50.34]True.
[429:50.78]He's an NPC.
[429:52.82]Why?
[429:52.98]Because I walk around the mall and go into Old Navy and buy jeans?
[429:56.90]Because I don't listen to the Beatles?
[429:59.48]That makes me like a non-playable character?
[430:03.90]Guess what, guys?
[430:04.92]When I play GTA, I turn the damn radio off.
[430:08.96]I'm driving around as, like, Franklin in that car, or as, um, Jared.
[430:14.69]What's his name?
[430:15.75]The other guy?
[430:16.85]Michael?
[430:17.19]And I turn it off.
[430:29.75]What's his name?
[430:31.41]Trevor.
[430:31.67]Trevor.
[430:32.23]Trevor.
[430:33.98]Did I say Jared?
[430:43.82]And that might be because I don't want to get my channel copyright striked, but it's also because I'm the playable character and I don't want to hear it.
[431:03.67]But, no, I do not really listen to that much music.
[431:06.73]I listen to it when it's available.
[431:08.37]But I don't listen to it kind of on purpose.
[431:13.45]I'll be, like, in a club or a... I don't... That's the lie.
[431:17.53]This doesn't happen.
[431:18.61]It only happens, like, when for some... I don't go to, like, clubs.
[431:23.90]But if I was there, I would hear the music in the club.
[431:29.52]I can't even tell... I don't even remember the last time I walked into a club.
[431:34.54]It has to have been when I was like, I don't know, like 22?
[431:38.85]I don't even, I have not walked inside of a club in probably 10 fucking years.
[431:44.01]I don't even know what they play in clubs anymore.
[431:45.73]The guy with the marshmallow head, right?
[431:51.94]And they play Fortnite music.
[431:55.12]That's what I heard.
[432:12.89]I'm actually seething.
[432:14.61]I'm kidding.
[432:15.27]It's a joke.
[432:18.09]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[432:19.99]Bye.
[432:20.85]Good night.
[432:21.37]Goodbye.
[432:22.29]See you Thursday.
[432:23.82]Take care of yourselves.
[432:24.80]Have a good night.
[433:09.19]you
[433:39.96]Thank you.
