[00:02.65]Alright, we're gonna play hide-and-seek.
[00:04.75]You have to find me, okay?
[00:06.98]Found you.
[00:09.46]Hide-and-seek?
[00:10.14]Come on, let's play hide-and-seek.
[00:11.38]Two minutes ago, the idea was let's play Team Fortress 2.
[00:14.74]Yeah, but don't you want to play hide-and-seek with me now?
[00:18.42]No.
[00:18.70]Do not turn around because I don't want you to know where I am.
[00:21.76]Okay.
[00:21.98]Understand?
[00:22.60]Yes, hide-and-seek, the probably dumbest thing you could ever think of.
[00:26.30]We're doing it.
[00:26.84]This isn't like, you know, normally people would just go play prop hunt, but prop hunt's too stupid for you.
[00:32.45]You have to take it to the next level of stupid.
[00:35.61]Okay, I'm ready.
[00:36.73]Okay.
[00:40.20]do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[00:45.38]Jerma!
[00:46.52]Jerma, how's it going buddy?
[00:48.08]What's going on?
[00:48.58]What are you doing over here?
[00:49.78]What's up with you?
[00:50.46]Just hanging out, you know, defending the point, waiting for my buddy Star to come on over.
[00:54.53]Hey, looks like we got some crits.
[00:56.57]You can come with me right now.
[00:59.15]We're going to be using these crits against enemy gamers, you know.
[01:02.13]You tell me when you want me to do it.
[01:04.03]Well, when I want you to do it, you're going to know, because I'm going to scream.
[01:10.33]You're not really going to scream, are you?
[01:20.97]Sorry, I didn't get a lot of people there.
[01:22.21]I thought there'd be more closer than that.
[01:24.41]What the hell was that?
[01:30.38]I just snorted it.
[01:31.20]I don't do that usually.
[01:33.22]Oh, you don't do that usually.
[01:34.40]Thanks for clarifying.
[01:35.96]Hey guys, guys, Jorma doesn't do that usually.
[01:39.64]So like if you're about to make fun of him for it, it's not a common thing.
[01:43.00]Yeah, I don't do it usually.
[01:44.95]Okay.
[01:46.63]Please tell me you're gonna scream again.
[01:49.08]Well, how else am I going to get you to crits me?
[01:52.82]You're going to have to build it up first.
[01:54.38]Hold on, I'm too, like, busy laughing.
[01:56.72]Alright.
[01:58.38]Alright, so when we build these crits up... We need to take it real careful.
[02:01.79]Just kill the medic over here, there's a sniper on there, but don't peek.
[02:05.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy, hide, hide.
[02:07.57]Hide, why are we hiding?
[02:08.81]Because there was a guy there that looked like he was going to shoot me.
[02:11.81]I killed him.
[02:12.99]Oh, you did?
[02:13.29]Okay, let's go.
[02:13.65]With the power of Kratos.
[02:15.90]With the power of the GOLDEN rocket launcher.
[02:22.92]Pass down from generation to generation.
[02:26.38]What are you going on about?
[02:27.53]Talking about your golden rocket launcher, how it's like a family heirloom.
[02:30.27]I was doing a whole thing there, and you just cut me off.
[02:32.41]Oh, well, do you have the crits?
[02:34.03]Yeah, I'm about...
[02:39.91]Watch out for the sentry, I can't- I can't- Alright, you are turning into the judge from Who Framed Roger Rabbit at this point.
[02:49.03]No, the worst part about this whole thing is I heard one of my neighbors coming out of their apartment and they, without question, 100% certainty, they heard me screaming.
[03:01.43]There's not a single doubt in my mind that they heard that.
[03:03.66]I just don't know what their thought process was.
[03:05.88]They're probably thinking, like, this guy either won the lottery or he's dying.
[03:10.69]That was a happy scream.
[03:11.73]That wasn't like a bad... Oh, boy.
[03:13.59]Watch out.
[03:13.97]Watch out.
[03:14.29]He got destroyed.
[03:15.13]Don't even worry about it.
[03:15.97]Can you... Honestly...
[03:18.72]Can you teach me how to shoot people in the air like that?
[03:22.17]Pretend this pipe is him in the air, okay?
[03:26.65]But that's what I do.
[03:27.57]I miss when I do it.
[03:28.51]Hey, I'm just trying to help.
[03:30.97]I'm getting attacked.
[03:33.43]Not anymore.
[03:37.02]Look.
[03:38.66]Easy, easy.
[03:39.30]Be careful.
[03:39.74]There's a sentry.
[03:40.44]I'm being easy.
[03:41.22]I'm being very easy.
[03:43.15]Nice.
[03:43.31]Nice job.
[03:43.69]Maybe we can walk our way out.
[03:45.17]No, this sniper's gonna headshot me.
[03:46.35]Alright, no more sto- Oh no, stop!
[03:53.88]Wow, you got like six people.
[03:56.22]Eh, I think it was four.
[03:57.36]But we got the sentry too.
[03:58.86]Alright, is the scream thing really necessary anymore?
[04:02.96]I don't know, how else would you have known?
[04:04.20]Watch sentry!
[04:05.62]Sentry being built!
[04:06.22]Sentry being built!
[04:06.76]Just get on the point!
[04:07.32]Just get on the point!
[04:08.10]Just get on the point!
[04:08.62]There's Pyro on top.
[04:09.50]Pyro!
[04:09.62]Pyro!
[04:09.80]We're good.
[04:12.66]Excellent.
[04:13.90]You did great right there.
[04:15.06]Can I just say?
[04:15.90]This has got to be peaking my microphone so bad.
[04:18.28]Yeah, you got a little quieter.
[04:20.08]That's for sure.
[04:21.22]That's for sure.
[04:23.54]Medic!
[04:23.98]Alright, stay right there.
[04:25.08]Alright, we're going to play hide and seek again.
[04:29.56]Where did he go?
[04:30.36]Alright, come find me.
[04:32.19]Oh, God, he doesn't know where I am.
[04:35.12]I'm gonna go play the game.
[04:36.51]I'm just gonna forget about you.
[04:39.15]Because you're obviously an insane person.
[04:43.77]Where is he?
[04:46.00]So, can we change the crit sound from you screaming to, like, you making a different sound?
[04:50.80]Like, crit's me, doctor!
[04:52.44]Can we change it to that?
[04:53.47]That's expected.
[04:55.65]No, because usually when you call for crits with someone, they're like, oh, I didn't know that you were saying it.
[05:00.96]No, you just yell, and there's no way you won't know that I wanted the crits.
[05:04.96]You know what I mean?
[05:07.00]I mean, yeah.
[05:07.74]Whoa, I just fed him so many kills.
[05:11.02]Take that.
[05:11.62]Get backstabbed.
[05:12.42]He just got backstabbed.
[05:15.32]There's a lot of snipers going on out here.
[05:17.49]I got killed.
[05:18.49]He really got you?
[05:19.75]He sniped me.
[05:20.31]He got me right in the stomach.
[05:21.93]Oh, I was taking my time killing them because I thought that they wouldn't shoot me, but they were shooting at you, the valuable target.
[05:27.63]I'm sitting there just, like, preparing myself for the real scream.
[05:31.28]I'm, like, sitting there clenching, like, he's gonna scream.
[05:35.16]We got a screamer on our hands.
[05:36.80]Alright, well, I'm waiting for you by the burger sign.
[05:40.38]There's a burger sign?
[05:41.36]Yeah, near the dead spy.
[05:43.13]Is it really a burger spy?
[05:44.23]Yeah.
[05:45.13]A burger spy?
[05:46.07]Is that what I just heard?
[05:47.11]No, a burger.
[05:47.57]Right here.
[05:48.74]Let's go.
[05:49.40]Oh, whoa.
[05:50.56]Grummies, burgers.
[05:52.34]That was like the most fake excitement I've ever heard in my life.
[05:55.78]Oh, whoa, burgers.
[05:57.60]I had no idea.
[05:58.42]Can we go?
[05:58.94]I'm healing this guy.
[06:00.74]He needed help.
[06:01.80]No, he didn't.
[06:02.34]He needed health.
[06:03.06]He needed an overheal.
[06:04.10]That guy is mad in chat.
[06:05.78]That guy, he was not into that.
[06:09.26]Nice.
[06:10.14]You just, nice pop.
[06:12.02]Pop and shot.
[06:12.94]Is this a spy?
[06:14.40]No, he's just holding his friend.
[06:15.50]Pop and shop.
[06:16.60]Hold on.
[06:16.92]I need to heal.
[06:17.40]Hold on.
[06:17.68]Hold on.
[06:17.96]Hold on.
[06:22.50]I was on fire.
[06:23.50]You're gonna have the crits soon?
[06:26.12]72%.
[06:29.06]But I want this guy to get his Uber up.
[06:32.51]See, it helps to get your Uber up.
[06:34.13]Watch out for that Pyro.
[06:35.11]No, it's the same Pyro who only walks forward.
[06:36.77]He won't reflect.
[06:37.41]Don't worry.
[06:37.95]Get this health.
[06:38.69]Give me one second.
[06:40.43]Just chill.
[06:42.19]You're taking your time.
[06:42.99]I have the crits.
[06:43.51]I have the crits.
[06:44.01]Going out the window and going left.
[06:44.92]Going out the window and going left.
[06:45.78]Don't scream.
[06:46.60]Please don't scream.
[06:47.46]Why would I not scream?
[06:48.81]Please, just say, just say, Jerma, I would like for you to give me the crit screen now, please.
[06:53.26]Okay.
[06:53.64]Jerma, the crit!
[06:54.78]Jerma!
[06:57.84]Okay, I really didn't need it, but I thought the comedic timing on that was pretty well done.
[07:02.82]Jerma, the crit!
[07:04.22]Who's that person gonna be?
[07:05.66]That person that comes and heals you.
[07:07.54]Ghostbusters!
[07:09.58]From the danger.
[07:10.86]And look, see this guy right there?
[07:13.28]I want you to take notes on this one.
[07:16.20]I'm going to take notes on this one.
[07:17.44]Hold on, we're not done.
[07:18.24]Well, yeah, you got him.
[07:18.94]I'm going to take notes on this one.
[07:20.90]Well, no, he's a gamer.
[07:22.32]You need to heal me.
[07:25.56]Come on, stop dodging.
[07:28.28]No!
[07:29.68]Speaking of dodging, how did neither of us get hit by that?
[07:32.16]I don't know.
[07:33.00]Hold on, hold on.
[07:34.20]I need to fall back.
[07:35.06]Spy behind.
[07:35.84]Spy!
[07:36.88]Spy dead.
[07:37.96]Make sure you heal yourself.
[07:39.06]Are you dead?
[07:40.13]He got me.
[07:40.85]No, you're bad.
[07:42.07]I was saying spy to you, and you were too busy.
[07:44.21]I was fighting the spy.
[07:46.43]You were not fighting the spy.
[07:47.33]I was fighting the spy.
[07:48.19]Your eyes were forward.
[07:50.73]And you were looking at, like, some pyro.
[07:53.91]This guy, he doesn't even know.
[07:54.69]Watch it.
[07:54.87]He doesn't even know.
[07:55.39]You don't have very much health.
[07:56.27]He's dead.
[07:58.32]He's dead.
[07:59.02]The beam is on you.
[07:59.94]What?
[08:00.10]What's going on?
[08:01.30]You see this?
[08:03.70]You don't see a beam.
[08:04.36]No, I don't see a beam at all.
[08:07.64]No, I don't.
[08:08.22]Can you just re-click on me?
[08:09.46]Like, Medic has been broken in this game for, like, seven years.
[08:12.87]Watch it!
[08:13.75]This is really new to you.
[08:15.25]Oh, lord.
[08:16.84]Okay.
[08:18.06]I watched him.
[08:19.08]Sniper's on the left, don't peek.
[08:22.38]I knew you were gonna do that.
[08:24.10]And he took so long to line it up.
[08:25.52]I was just waiting for the- how long is it gonna take Jerma to peek?
[08:31.28]I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, cause it was like, we were getting close to winning that.
[08:36.99]Yeah, yeah, I mean we were right up there, you're building crits- You shouldn't have even mentioned it!
[08:42.27]I shouldn't have, but I-
[08:44.99]There's a soldier that has... He's behind us.
[08:47.97]I don't know if he's gonna rocket jump up here, but he might rocket jump up here.
[08:51.79]No, no, we're good.
[08:52.53]We're good.
[08:52.89]We're good.
[08:53.23]We're good.
[08:53.59]We're good.
[08:53.93]We're good.
[08:54.27]We're good.
[08:54.63]We're good.
[08:55.73]Get that 70%.
[08:57.04]Get that last 30%.
[08:57.54]Let's climb up again.
[08:58.60]Let's climb up again.
[08:59.24]Let's climb up.
[08:59.72]I gotta say everything like four times because you're an infant.
[09:03.46]You could have just said it once and I would have understood.
[09:05.16]You messed up!
[09:06.68]If I would have said it a few more times, you'd have... Oh my god, this is not... I'm not doing this on purpose.
[09:11.40]I promise you this.
[09:12.55]I...
[09:15.22]No, you're knocking me off.
[09:16.02]That's what happened.
[09:16.90]Yeah, that's what happened.
[09:17.95]Can you use this?
[09:19.69]I used it.
[09:19.97]Is that what you wanted?
[09:22.05]Not right that moment.
[09:23.86]Are you joking?
[09:24.95]No, okay, I looked real bad right there.
[09:27.26]Let me just clarify this for a second.
[09:29.16]Yeah, guys, come on.
[09:29.90]He doesn't usually snort.
[09:33.14]What I want to say is that you used it at a time that was not opportune for me, and it's because I didn't scream, and you were unsure if I wanted it at that time.
[09:41.44]See, that's why the scream method is 100% flawless.
[09:45.58]You know, crazily enough, like really, truly crazily enough, you are correct.
[09:49.50]I thought you said use it.
[09:51.81]No, I was going to say, like, we're getting ready to use it.
[09:54.27]Like, I want to... Let's wait until we turn around the corner.
[09:56.76]Climb up here again.
[09:57.74]Can you do it?
[09:58.78]Can you do it?
[10:00.46]Look, I'm going to do it.
[10:01.34]Don't worry.
[10:03.74]Just don't knock me off.
[10:05.06]Okay, nice job.
[10:05.84]Nice job.
[10:06.62]You think we can win this?
[10:07.48]We've had them at their last for, like, the longest amount of time.
[10:09.72]We're going to win right here.
[10:11.62]This is a win.
[10:12.44]Watch out for those spies.
[10:14.38]I have... Don't worry.
[10:16.20]I'm looking back.
[10:17.46]I'm checking the perimeter.
[10:19.14]This guy's just building a sentry.
[10:21.31]Oh, we're capping the- we didn't even do anything!
[10:23.39]We did it.
[10:23.93]We won.
[10:24.23]Nice job.
[10:24.95]Yeah, great.
[10:25.81]Excellent stuff.
[10:26.75]Excellent stuff.
[10:27.71]Great showmanship of shows.
[10:29.94]Who even capped that?
[10:31.02]I don't know.
[10:31.46]Some dude.
[10:32.94]Can I get you, uh, french fries?
[10:34.68]Can I get you anything?
[10:36.16]Anything at all?
[10:36.68]Let me know anything.
[10:37.56]I am here.
[10:38.14]Can you just get me to mid with 300 health?
[10:41.20]Uh, okay.
[10:42.10]That's all I want, honestly.
[10:43.22]That'll be $9.99, please.
[10:45.06]Okay.
[10:45.42]Well, I'll give that to you right after we get there.
[10:49.94]Okay, okay.
[10:51.02]We're about there.
[10:51.58]Um, let me check my pants.
[10:55.15]Okay.
[10:55.67]There's... SPY!
[10:57.43]What, what, what, what?
[10:59.43]Were you serious?
[11:00.29]Yes!
[11:01.21]How did you... Well, you made the joke and you got the spy, so that's a win.
[11:05.03]He had plenty of time to stab you.
[11:06.69]It was very scary.
[11:09.73]Ooh!
[11:09.99]Ooh!
[11:10.84]Ooh!
[11:11.98]Ooh!
[11:14.49]Okay, let's go.
[11:14.99]Let's go.
[11:15.28]Let's go.
[11:15.60]Let's go.
[11:15.92]Pick up the pace.
[11:16.52]Pick up the pace.
[11:17.96]We want to win this in under one minute.
[11:19.82]This is the speedrun.
[11:20.90]Under one minute?
[11:21.78]Are you sure we're going to be able to do that?
[11:23.04]Yes.
[11:23.86]Climb up.
[11:24.80]This is the climb strat.
[11:25.58]We're going to keep doing the climb strat.
[11:28.95]Just go straight to last.
[11:30.37]They might have sentries.
[11:31.51]We got scouts.
[11:32.69]Okay, no spy.
[11:33.63]No spy.
[11:36.23]Got it.
[11:36.49]I understood.
[11:37.65]I completely understood.
[11:41.36]Okay, okay.
[11:42.76]It works a lot better when I scream.
[11:44.78]I'm dead!
[11:47.06]No!
[11:47.78]There's just engineers everywhere!
[11:49.14]We got it!
[11:49.46]We got it!
[11:49.88]We got it!
[11:51.20]We got it!
