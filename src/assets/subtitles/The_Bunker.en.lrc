[01:07.41]Wait, what do you mean?
[01:08.27]Hold on a second.
[01:09.71]Decker wins.
[01:10.53]What do you mean, Decker wins?
[01:11.73]I closed the poll like 10 minutes ago.
[01:16.53]What do you mean, Decker wins?
[01:19.86]Does it have more votes now?
[01:23.66]Yeah, well, I mean, I closed the poll already.
[01:30.08]Look, just because you didn't get to the election fast enough, the election happened.
[01:38.70]Bunker 1 with the allowed time frame.
[01:44.29]It don't matter.
[01:44.83]We're gonna play all these fucking games anyways.
[01:46.95]Don't even worry about it.
[01:49.47]You're gonna get Bunker.
[01:51.49]Then you're gonna get Decker.
[01:53.87]Then you're going to get SWAT.
[01:56.67]Then you're going to get Contradiction.
[01:57.71]Then you're going to... No, Stay Dead Evolution I'm going to play whenever I want because that game looks terrible.
[02:03.07]But... Yeah, I mean, come on.
[02:08.91]The people said Deckard.
[02:10.18]Yeah, well, like, you didn't get to the booth fast enough.
[02:15.26]There's Election Day.
[02:16.20]There's an Election Day.
[02:20.36]I want a recount.
[02:23.45]No, we're doing the bunker.
[02:26.73]I mean, they're all going to be potentially good.
[02:29.47]It depends on which one it is, though.
[02:33.41]Just get ready for bunker.
[02:35.53]I don't know why I like saying that so much.
[02:37.57]Anyways, hi.
[02:38.65]I hope you had a good 4th of July.
[02:41.44]Welcome to those of you that had your holiday.
[02:44.60]Hopefully it was a good one.
[02:45.48]Hopefully it was safe.
[02:46.30]Hopefully you didn't use any firecrackers.
[02:49.96]You know?
[02:51.16]In some states, those are illegal.
[02:52.40]By the way, let's just go over this right now.
[02:54.72]Let's just switch over to... I want to talk about this.
[03:00.38]What's the... What's the deal with Massachusetts fireworks being illegal?
[03:07.40]You're talking about, like, the birthplace of independence in America.
[03:12.14]Literally, like, the place where fireworks should be legal.
[03:15.91]They're 100% illegal.
[03:17.73]You can't even have a sparkler in Massachusetts.
[03:21.45]Who fucking made those laws?
[03:25.75]Like, Paul Revere, the British are coming.
[03:29.04]Like, was down the street over here.
[03:30.86]And, like, I can't buy a fucking sparkler?
[03:34.50]Dig him up.
[03:34.90]We'll see what he says.
[03:40.14]Anyways, hi.
[03:40.58]Uh, yeah, we're gonna play another... Hey, welcome to, like, the FMV streamer where we fucking play, like, full motion video games.
[03:47.81]But really, though... I... Hold on, did somebody give, like, a hundred dollars?
[03:56.41]Did somebody give a fucking hundred bucks at some point that I missed?
[03:58.77]I don't know.
[04:01.79]Well, apparently they did.
[04:03.13]Now, this is not Late Shift, this is The Bunker.
[04:09.51]FMV Friday.
[04:12.65]I've been really into FMV games.
[04:14.21]I don't know why.
[04:14.75]I could probably tell you why.
[04:17.19]It'll be a long-winded conversation.
[04:19.91]Alright, let's get started.
[04:24.48]Let's just open this.
[04:26.12]I feel like my internet's been really weird lately.
[04:31.82]It's been sort of all over the place.
[04:34.10]I don't know anything about this game.
[04:41.16]I got my tweet out.
[04:42.66]I'm just waiting for, you know, people to trickle in, waiting for, you know, the people to get here.
[04:48.19]You heard my, I mean, Massachusetts fireworks should be legal.
[04:51.35]It's fucking stupid.
[04:53.41]And by the way, what are they going to do?
[04:55.26]Oh, by the way, you can face jail time.
[04:57.48]Oh, really?
[04:59.32]Like, on the 4th of July, I was standing outside, and it was just like... You're gonna arrest, like, fucking 10,000 people lighting off, like, firecrackers?
[05:13.80]You're gonna go to jail if you light off a firework in Massachusetts.
[05:18.04]Oh, okay, well, wrap them all up, because, like, they're all fucking here.
[05:23.51]I don't understand that.
[05:24.91]Make it legal, tax the fuck out of it, and then pave our roads.
[05:28.43]Yeah, I don't understand this.
[05:30.33]Make it legal, tax the roads, and then pave our fireworks.
[05:33.33]I don't understand America sometimes.
[05:35.82]You know what I mean?
[05:37.58]Let's go.
[05:42.08]New game.
[05:44.16]Here comes the cutscene.
[05:48.68]3rd of July, 1986.
[05:49.20]Whoa, this is close.
[05:51.34]4th of July.
[05:56.99]We got some shaky camera here.
[05:58.26]End of the light.
[06:04.50]Hold off the presses!
[06:06.06]A murderer is out in New York!
[06:09.60]What do you think about this, Chief?
[06:13.20]The whole world is collapsing.
[06:17.67]That guy just took... They were playing Risk.
[06:19.59]That guy just got Kurkutsk without any issue.
[06:27.29]Oh, fuck, I don't... Alright, we're gonna have subtitle this time.
[06:38.64]Simon Sparks, he's a fucking legend.
[06:44.56]What if there's an option to, like, suck the baby back in?
[06:48.43]Okay, that was gross.
[06:53.07]Push out or suck baby in?
[06:57.33]What the fuck?
[07:05.08]Outlast 2 again.
[07:06.18]I hope not.
[07:10.76]For a second I thought that said, hee hee.
[07:13.72]One of the doctors just goes, oh, hee hee.
[07:17.55]How are we on the audio department?
[07:19.93]Can you guys hear me?
[07:23.77]What?
[07:29.06]What if I didn't click that?
[07:32.78]Click to breathe.
[07:34.68]Oh, and then that's where we got nuked.
[07:36.43]What?
[07:42.61]This is just Fallout.
[07:50.97]The bunker.
[07:55.09]Oh god, ow.
[08:09.35]Clive Jericho presents The Bunker.
[08:12.53]What's that guy's name?
[08:14.41]What's the guy that made that... Clive... Clive Parker?
[08:20.90]Jive?
[08:21.38]What's his name?
[08:21.90]What's that guy's name?
[08:23.28]Clive Jericho.
[08:24.10]What's his name?
[08:31.01]Clive Barker.
[08:32.31]Is that what it is?
[08:32.93]Craig Barker?
[08:33.81]Oh, whoa, whoa, wait, hold on a minute.
[08:37.03]Why do I have, like, a gun?
[08:40.07]Am I supposed to be doing something?
[08:40.95]Do I need to click on anything?
[08:45.66]This is just Five Nights at Freddy's, except I have a crosshair.
[08:49.34]When's, like, the fucking Mupp Muppet gonna come up and scream in my face?
[08:52.68]With four frames of animation.
[09:01.76]Oh, so this is the baby.
[09:12.66]This is the mom and this is the baby.
[09:13.89]As long as I stick to the routine, I'll be safe.
[09:24.29]As long as I stay in our rooms, I'll be safe.
[09:29.01]Wait, what?
[09:29.61]Did they just use the same audio clip?
[09:31.59]Why are they using the same audio?
[09:35.67]Okay, which book do I want to read?
[09:40.10]I mean, obviously.
[09:44.32]Look at this bullshit.
[09:54.30]You put these fucking books in front of me, uh, the Bible?
[09:56.90]No thanks.
[09:57.98]Uh, somebody's like fucking college textbook.
[10:00.95]Or Treasure Island.
[10:03.01]Absolute Treasure Island.
[10:04.17]Are you kidding me?
[10:10.21]I get the bad ending.
[10:18.36]Come on, I didn't even get to read the first passage!
[10:25.61]What's this fucking spit coming up?
[10:40.77]Who's dying here?
[10:41.45]I don't know.
[10:41.85]Like, we both couldn't be.
[10:53.33]She didn't want Treasure Island.
[10:54.61]Yeah, I picked Treasure Island and it killed her.
[10:57.45]Maybe she would have got, like, +2 health points if I used, like, the engineering book.
[11:05.77]Alright.
[11:06.09]And we got it.
[11:06.61]This is, like, 30 years later.
[11:07.99]They're in the bunker.
[11:10.09]I just got an achievement.
[11:14.01]Can't go outside when you're in the bunker.. You have to stay here.
[11:16.85]And here we go.
[11:18.77]Here's my personality test.
[11:19.97]I'm going to have to pick shit, just like in Entrilled On.
[11:22.30]Entrilled On.
[11:26.94]Okay, here we go.
[11:28.10]The routine.
[11:28.86]Medical, vitamins, and docimator.
[11:31.78]Radio, radiation check, food, and mother.
[11:35.24]Uh, well, okay, this is the checklist.
[11:39.39]Medical, vitamins.
[11:43.69]I have to pick what vitamins to take out?
[11:45.99]Um... We'll go in there and take out the...
[11:55.97]This looks like the random pills.
[12:00.16]Well, game's too quiet.
[12:01.42]I'll fix that.
[12:05.52]I'll fix that.
[12:07.76]There.
[12:09.24]That better?
[12:09.60]You hear it?
[12:10.96]Alright, which one of these drugs should I take?
[12:13.98]The unnamed bottle of, like, Robitussin.
[12:17.69]We're going to take the stick.
[12:19.17]Yeah.
[12:28.98]So do it.
[12:31.42]My vitamin B level is low.
[12:34.18]So take the vitamin B shot and stick it in your ass.
[12:41.32]Is this the vitamin B?
[12:43.16]It has to be, apparently.
[12:47.90]Ugh, sour!
[12:49.20]Sour Patch Kids!
[12:50.28]They're intense!
[12:54.64]I can check my radiation level with the dosimeter.
[13:03.57]I guess this is what we have to do.
[13:07.59]I feel like that's not how that works.
[13:10.97]I thought he holds it up to his eye.
[13:12.51]I gotta hold the button.
[13:16.34]Radiation is just over 70 mR. That's acceptable.
[13:20.72]I need to look at the spyglass.
[13:22.22]Alright, check that off.
[13:25.72]Yep, check that one.
[13:29.16]Use the radio.
[13:29.74]Didn't I just do the radiation check?
[13:36.73]Anybody else here, or is it just me and this weird guy?
[13:43.37]Um... Alright, let's... What's the Konami code?
[13:48.88]Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, right?
[13:53.86]So, up, up, down, down, left, right...
[14:02.03]I can only go... That upset him.
[14:07.05]Left, right.
[14:14.51]Left, right.
[14:15.09]Okay, well there's nothing on the radio.
[14:25.72]Radiation check.
[14:26.44]Didn't I do that with the, uh, the Doximator?
[14:28.58]Didn't I do that with the Doximator?
[14:31.88]Alright, like, I'm gonna put my eyes in front of the screen.
[14:33.68]It's gonna, like, blast radiation in my face.
[14:36.01]Press this button.
[14:41.25]Regional Government HQ 5.1.
[14:43.03]Davies Roberts Operating System Version 1.0.
[14:44.91]Console 402FA2.
[14:45.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:46.87]Directory exact.
[14:47.79]System okay.
[14:48.40]Time in bunker 11,000 days.
[14:51.20]What?
[14:53.10]One survivor.
[14:55.68]Oh, by the way, thank you to Whole of One Zombie for the 15 bucks.
[14:58.72]I don't think this guy is all there, if you know what I mean.
[15:01.08]Well...
[15:02.92]It's okay.
[15:05.76]Thank you for the $15.
[15:07.46]Also, thank you to... Whoa!
[15:11.76]Whoa.
[15:13.70]Okay, hold on.
[15:15.70]Why did it not pop up on stream?
[15:19.42]Will it pop up on stream?
[15:20.56]Somebody just gave over $100 and it didn't even show up.
[15:24.08]Streamlabs lagged.
[15:32.50]Okay, well anyways, Stix Renegade, thank you so much for the $105.
[15:37.48]That's a fucking $105.
[15:43.23]And they say, Hey Jerma, the Ster Jerma Archive YouTube channel says hi.
[15:49.25]Not sure if you know that, but they've been archiving your streams for eight months, wanting to preserve your content for others to see since Twitch deletes your streams after a couple months.
[15:57.27]60 days, yeah.
[15:57.76]Also, yay, new Twitch badge for me.
[15:59.48]By the way, it was Sneagil who donated $100 earlier.
[16:02.56]He made a Your Ass is Grass joke.
[16:04.52]Well, thank you, Sneagil, and thank you, SticksRenegade, for the fucking $100 plus.
[16:08.36]Yeah, that's cool.
[16:10.68]I'm glad that you're preserving the long-form stream content.
[16:16.33]I can't get it to pop up on fucking screen.
[16:17.75]I don't know what the hell happened.
[16:21.29]Well, I'm sorry that it didn't pop up, but, like, SticksRenegade, thanks for the fucking $100 goddamn dollars.
[16:29.10]And what's going on with, like, the emote's on the screen?
[16:32.10]What is going on here?
[16:33.32]I think, like, Streamlabs is a little, like, screwy-loey right now.
[16:37.52]But let's do a radiation check.
[16:40.12]Um, a huge thank you, though, to YouTube.
[16:42.64]Like, that's fucking, like, everything's okay, right?
[16:46.31]You know what I mean?
[16:48.59]Okay.
[16:50.59]But thank you, guys.
[16:51.35]Alright, so now we have to eat food, right?
[16:57.53]It's the default notification.
[16:58.73]Did they change something?
[17:00.09]Why can I not get this to pop up, though?
[17:02.89]Like, it should pop up.
[17:08.85]I don't know.
[17:09.37]I'm sorry that it didn't.
[17:10.77]Weird.
[17:12.69]Anyways, let's go eat some food.
[17:15.56]Define a normal radiation.
[17:20.92]Ah, you know, radiation is... Am I going in the toilet for food?
[17:28.49]Okay, we can go, should I go toilet paper?
[17:34.78]We got canned food, we got canned goods, we got canned stuff.
[17:38.74]I was gonna make a, wait, what's the difference?
[17:40.26]Go this way.
[17:41.48]Peas and carrots, I suppose.
[17:44.04]Peas and carrots.
[17:44.82]So that makes 27 years, three months, and 14 days of food left.
[17:49.93]Oh, what the fuck?
[17:54.42]You see, I know that because I shit out into another can and I eat that some point in the future.
[18:02.86]What?
[18:04.40]He's got a never-ending food supply.
[18:09.87]Let's go check on mother.
[18:16.73]I decided to wrap her up like a mummy.
[18:18.51]What the fuck?
[18:23.89]What does this want me to do?
[18:32.15]This is really creeping me out.
[18:33.93]He's been in the bunker his whole life.
[18:37.67]I get you.
[18:46.68]This is going to be like a Jason situation where I'm Jason and like this is my mother and all that shit.
[18:51.33]Oh, the Bible.
[18:51.93]We've got to read the last rites.
[18:53.07]It's reading time.
[18:54.29]Reading time.
[18:54.89]Well, we might as well read Mother of the Last Rites.
[18:58.65]Cast thy bread upon the running waters, for after a long time thou shalt find it again.
[19:05.59]Give a portion to seven and also to eight.
[19:09.01]And thou knowest... Yeah, it's seven, eight, nine.
[19:11.62]Pretty good one, buddy.
[19:13.56]If the cloud be full, it will pour out rain upon the Earth.
[19:17.74]If the tree fall to the south or the north, in that place, so ever... The north remembers.
[19:24.62]Okay, so I did my checklist.
[19:31.89]Now what?
[19:35.14]It's going to be about you keep doing the routine and then... 11,000 days.
[19:39.66]Isn't that like... Isn't that like 75 years?
[19:42.70]I'm going to have to do this again.
[19:46.70]I don't want to do this again.
[19:51.46]We already did this.
[19:58.05]Oh, whoa!
[19:58.59]The intense flavor!
[19:59.63]Try out new watermelons!
[20:01.53]It's too quick.
[20:02.23]I couldn't do it.
[20:05.32]Ah, goddammit.
[20:06.00]I'm gonna be ready for that one.
[20:09.50]Radiation is nearly ATMR.
[20:12.36]It's increasing.
[20:15.48]Yeah, okay, hold on a minute.
[20:16.72]I hope I have to do this again.
[20:20.74]I hope I have to do this again.
[20:23.44]If I have to do it again, you just, yes, you wait.
[20:25.16]I'm gonna make a fucking A-plus joke.
[20:36.08]He's gonna hear like a crash and all of a sudden it's gonna be like Jason's gonna show up.
[20:40.52]System okay.
[20:42.06]You've been in here for 68 years.
[20:44.24]Do a radiation check.
[20:45.38]System running.
[20:46.04]Oxygen okay.
[20:46.80]Temperature okay.
[20:47.46]Boiler okay.
[20:48.08]Server okay.
[20:48.62]Water okay.
[20:49.19]Communications okay.
[20:50.07]Air filtration okay.
[20:50.91]Sewage waste okay.
[20:51.65]Electrical is okay.
[20:53.97]Everything is functioning completely fucking normally.
[20:56.03]Remember to eat and then shit.
[21:07.99]I didn't get to pick this time.
[21:09.26]27 years, 3 months, and 13 years left.
[21:15.45]Funny jokes.
[21:19.88]Oh my God, I'm sorry.
[21:22.56]That was completely uncalled for.
[21:24.52]That wasn't funny.
[21:25.46]That was so unfunny that it was not funny, that it was kind of funny.
[21:29.98]I'm fucking sorry.
[21:31.55]There were no sign of any wind, and the boats had gone out.
[21:34.33]Hey, Rico!
[21:37.51]Bangs on the corner of the island, up around the narrow passages to the haven behind Skeleton Island.
[21:52.07]Okay.
[21:54.29]Food, mother.
[21:55.03]Yeah, we did that.
[21:55.77]Yeah.
[22:03.96]I guess we just keep going.
[22:05.24]Okay, hold on.
[22:08.38]Let's take out vitamins.
[22:09.34]Everyone hold on.
[22:20.92]Okay, um...
[22:22.99]See if I can get this right.
[22:29.47]Okay.
[22:32.11]Let's take our vitamins.
[22:36.07]First they're sour.
[22:38.69]Then they're sweet.
[22:40.50]Sour Patch Kids.
[22:41.68]Sour, sweet, gone.
[22:47.37]I thought the commercial was going to be longer.
[22:51.39]I thought the commercial was going to be longer than that.
[22:53.07]I'm sorry.
[22:56.11]It was just me saying that.
[22:57.41]I didn't have to put a YouTube video up for that shit.
[23:06.84]Okay, thank you to Hall of One Zombie again.
[23:10.46]Told you this guy was odd.
[23:12.10]Thank you for the 15 bucks, everybody.
[23:17.31]Uh-oh.
[23:18.47]Uh-oh.
[23:21.01]Analyzing.
[23:24.55]System malfunction incoming.
[23:26.93]Server failure.
[23:28.05]Follow procedure manual to... Oh, there's actually Sour Patch Kids emotes.
[23:34.98]I forgot.
[23:36.44]Alright, here comes the game.
[23:37.12]Are you ready for some gameplay?
[23:39.88]I'm ready.
[23:41.96]You know when there's a loading screen?
[23:44.08]Shit goes nuts.
[23:47.80]Just play with my fucked up action figurines.
[23:52.28]Sometimes I make people out of paper and eat them.
[23:54.84]What do I do, mother?
[23:57.10]These are half people that I've eaten.
[24:05.44]I don't know what to do.
[24:07.02]Well, get up from the seat, man.
[24:08.70]You've got to do something.
[24:09.56]System failure.
[24:12.22]Smash on the keyboard.
[24:13.45]Follow procedural menu 23867.
[24:14.49]Where's the manual?
[24:16.69]What's going on?
[24:19.10]Alright, where's the manual?
[24:20.62]Alright, dude, you can't just stare at a screen.
[24:26.09]Get the fuck out of here.
[24:26.91]Alright, open this up.
[24:33.05]There's got to be something in a drawer.
[24:37.98]My diary.
[24:38.80]No, don't start reading your fucking diary.
[24:40.88]Today it is my birthday, and I have had extra peaches, my favorite.
[24:45.22]And there was a candle.
[24:46.88]Mom gave me this book and some pens.
[24:49.37]Look, here are the colors.
[24:50.61]Vera sang me a ring-a-ring-a-roses.
[24:54.05]She said she was crying when she was happy.
[24:56.33]It's my birthday.
[24:57.73]And then she and PJ and Louie and Mom sang me happy birthday, but not too loud.
[25:02.53]Alright, enough, enough, enough.
[25:03.43]I probably should pay attention to this.
[25:05.78]This book is going to be my book about my friends.
[25:10.10]Today I will start a new friend.
[25:11.26]It's all acted out.
[25:12.10]He looked like this.
[25:14.30]He will be a soldier because I have a general, but I need a bigger army.
[25:18.46]I've got a block from the map room, but I had to hide.
[25:21.20]Mr. Bishop was there.
[25:24.90]He was shouting.
[25:26.04]He says I am a waste.
[25:27.70]I think he's a waste.
[25:29.64]I will make the soldier, and Mr. Churchill and Joan of Arc will tell him to fight Mr. Bishop.
[25:35.89]We had ham today.
[25:37.23]It is sort of pink and sticky.
[25:40.01]It is better than sardines, which are the worst.

[26:32.45]Alright, keep going.
[26:38.43]Open it up.
[26:40.81]There it is.
[26:41.41]I can't take this noise anymore.
[26:45.64]This thing is gigantic.
[26:50.71]Oh, he found it.
[26:54.53]Inventive server build.
[26:55.41]Make announcement that main's power is being shut down for maintenance.
[26:58.65]Find fuse box located in storage room.
[27:00.49]Level 2 and identify damaged fuse.
[27:01.75]Locate replacement fuse.
[27:02.72]Shut down main.
[27:03.26]Wait 10 seconds.
[27:03.86]Replace damaged fuse.
[27:05.86]Alright.
[27:06.12]Make an announcement.
[27:07.76]Go in the morning announcements.
[27:08.86]Okay.
[27:10.90]Find the fuse box level 2.
[27:13.15]Find the fuse box level 2.
[27:14.89]Fuse box level 2.
[27:22.74]Trust I to view toy collection.
[27:26.40]Mom.
[27:26.62]Mom.
[27:29.35]Toys?
[27:29.87]What the fuck?
[27:34.13]I need to find the fuse box on level two.
[27:36.75]Well, first go in here and grab the knife.
[27:40.81]There's nothing in there I need.
[27:44.23]Make announcement to the toys.
[27:45.74]Alright, well, shit's about to get, like, interesting.
[27:49.56]I mean, is there anybody else here?
[27:57.68]Like, that's what I don't understand.
[27:58.70]Like, am I the only person here?
[28:00.70]I don't think so.
[28:03.42]Maybe I am.
[28:03.98]I love how, like, Mom is just in this bed.
[28:15.18]Oh, God.
[28:15.68]No, no, no.
[28:16.88]No, like, little kid narration again.
[28:18.68]Nice fucking drawings.
[28:22.07]It's like a Nerf gun.
[28:27.86]This is me.
[28:28.86]This is what I look like.
[28:31.56]And then this is the sun.
[28:34.24]This is NASA.
[28:36.62]And this is a whale that I saw one time at the amusement park.
[28:40.69]I liked it.
[28:45.79]We need to open all the drawers because there's probably something in here.
[28:53.34]What is this?
[28:55.44]Key.
[28:55.90]Alright, we got a key now.
[28:59.30]The key.
[29:02.33]Now I have to leave.
[29:06.09]Okay.
[29:06.60]Now we have to leave.
[29:07.56]Let's go.
[29:09.59]Hey, thank you, Pig, for the bits.
[29:11.05]Hey, you mentioned the movie The Triplets of Belleville in your Little Nightmare stream.
[29:13.67]I checked it out, and also The Illusionist a bit afterwards.
[29:15.89]I'm scared.
[29:17.24]Like, who cares about you?
[29:18.96]Not you, like this guy.
[29:21.66]I really like both movies.
[29:22.58]Characters of The Triplets of Belleville were really interesting and goofy also.
[29:24.86]I don't know when you last saw The Illusionist, but I feel like I'll have to watch it again sometime, ending making me feel all sorts of things.
[29:31.70]Well, The Triplets of Belleville is just like a classic, like, strange movie.
[29:35.10]Like, if you've never seen it, please, like, watch The Triplets of Belleville.
[29:38.76]It's just odd, and fucking intense, and fun, and... Like, it's an old, like, actually animated movie.
[29:43.60]None of this Pixar fucking 3D shit.
[29:46.18]Get that out of here.
[29:47.00]You know what I mean?
[29:47.98]Can we get something non-Pixar, like, 3D animated dog shit?
[29:54.28]Use the... Use the fucking key.
[29:56.76]Come on.
[29:58.80]Okay.
[29:58.90]You know who he's standing with?
[30:00.93]Who is he?
[30:07.76]I'm so scared to leave my office.
[30:10.50]Or my room, whatever.
[30:11.24]This door's like electricity.
[30:18.01]Oh, it's doing that thing where I'm becoming three people fading in and out.
[30:21.51]I'm going to pass out.
[30:22.19]Here we go.
[30:23.11]I'm going to pass out.
[30:25.37]He's going to pass out.
[30:26.11]He's going to puke.
[30:35.98]Come on.
[30:36.44]You can do it.
[30:38.70]You can do it.
[30:40.12]Good.
[30:45.24]Uh, no, by the way, I don't hate all, like, 3D-innovated movies.
[30:48.30]I'm saying that to be, uh, facetious.
[30:51.83]Level 2.
[30:52.09]You know, I made it like a Wallace and Gromit joke in a previous stream, but this guy just is Wallace.
[31:07.77]Hold on, where is it?
[31:15.38]Like, come on.
[31:17.18]The city of a thousand planets.
[31:19.52]What am I supposed to do here?
[31:20.32]Oh, press the button.
[31:24.23]Hey!
[31:24.53]Hey!
[31:25.99]You clean those up, young man!
[31:28.17]Okay.
[31:28.97]I'm sorry.
[31:29.71]And I've taken the spoil supplies off and spit it out.
[31:35.65]14 months.
[31:36.67]At best.
[31:38.71]If we carry on as we are eight months.
[31:41.50]But I've gone over it with Dr. Hart.
[31:43.64]On bare minimum, we might make 14.
[31:45.66]On bare minimum means?
[31:48.58]He does have an intense voice.
[31:50.82]Scurvy rickets.
[31:54.41]Christ.
[31:56.69]Then we all just withered away to skin and bone.
[31:59.87]Cool.
[32:02.85]Maybe I should have just left the hatch open and gone for a nice stroll in the fresh air instead.
[32:07.25]What do we do?
[32:08.51]You tell people everything's alright.
[32:10.05]It's not alright.
[32:10.85]One whiff of this and you'll have your throat slit over the last tin of peaches.
[32:14.79]Whoa.
[32:15.95]Is that the way you want to die, Sam?
[32:17.87]Dad is not.
[32:19.57]That is not cool.
[32:20.37]You could just cut your wrist now and split your rations.
[32:25.13]Look at this area down here.
[32:28.19]It's fucking huge.
[32:29.31]The gun.
[32:30.85]The gun is big.
[32:31.57]It's a big handgun.
[33:06.02]Okay, that's enough.
[33:06.66]That's enough.
[33:07.06]Let's go.
[33:07.52]Why is this taking so long?
[33:08.84]Get down the fucking stairs.
[33:09.92]Alright, we're at level two.
[33:15.08]Here we go.
[33:20.31]We made it to level two.
[33:22.25]That was level one.
[33:23.15]Now we're at level two.
[33:25.01]There's eight levels.
[33:31.92]Alright, now we're getting a little creepy.
[33:33.32]Getting a little crawly.
[33:34.25]You know what I mean?
[33:34.79]Creepy crawlers.
[33:39.05]Whoa!
[33:45.27]Ew, I remember.
[33:47.41]I remember this shit.
[33:49.08]Alright, I gotta... Honestly, I'm just making, like, noises now.
[33:51.56]What do I need?
[33:52.74]Communication from Bunker HQ, Site 3.
[33:55.56]Caution, Wiltshire.
[33:58.00]Prime Minister delivered safely before blast hits.
[34:00.76]Yeah.
[34:02.31]4,013 government ministers and civil servants, including... Does that say 5 minister unsatisfied?
[34:08.63]Fucking you!
[34:10.25]Fucking!
[34:11.29]Shortage noted in domestic support staff.
[34:15.82]Talk fucking sacred, mate.
[34:17.18]Alright, what's this?
[34:20.42]Okay, press enter.
[34:24.52]Regional reports, medical reports, personal logs, select options, whatever.
[34:27.88]Whatever.
[34:29.96]Somebody's got, like, googly eyes, what happened?
[34:34.33]Medical reports.
[34:36.53]October 1996.
[34:38.07]Cause of death unknown.
[34:38.99]Autopsy inconclusive.
[34:41.19]Personal log.
[34:42.77]It's gonna be fine.
[34:43.43]Okay, so maybe fine isn't the right word, but I'm doing this wrong.
[34:46.98]We have enough supplies to make it through, I'm sure of it.
[34:50.24]If we can just keep it together and be sensible with the rations, then we can make it.
[34:54.40]Sure, none of us are going to get fat down here, but I could use losing a few pounds anyways.
[34:59.79]Fucking English.
[35:01.39]Things I miss.
[35:02.19]Eggs and chips.
[35:02.85]Having a bath.
[35:03.39]My bed.
[35:03.81]Warm sun on my neck.
[35:04.75]Brass.
[35:05.07]Chocolate.
[35:05.59]Natalie.
[35:06.03]Things I hate.
[35:06.61]Sardines.
[35:07.09]The bunker smell.
[35:07.81]And level five.
[35:08.67]Dan, this is Alex.
[35:17.85]Please send this out to all the Berkshire stations and let me know.
[35:22.91]Thanks.
[35:23.25]Well, I just cut her off.
[35:25.62]What did I need down here?
[35:30.46]Oh.
[35:35.43]This game is literally just a movie.
[35:37.19]Well, we don't know that yet.
[35:39.77]We might just be getting into it.
[35:47.37]Okay, we can go this way.
[35:51.11]Let's go in the men's room.
[35:52.93]The commissioner's room.
[35:58.07]We can get another flashback.
[36:00.44]With the greatest respect, sir, we've been up all night.
[36:03.86]It's been ten minutes since I had to cover Vera's face.
[36:07.62]But is it radiation sickness?
[36:09.68]I don't know yet.
[36:11.06]The nearest proper lab is under ten tons of radioactive rubble.
[36:15.30]And I have to make do with a microscope.
[36:17.60]It's alright, George.
[36:18.60]Just wait.
[36:20.08]You'll see.
[36:20.62]We'll run some tests, Mr. Bishop.
[36:22.38]Is anyone else showing signs?
[36:23.94]Yes, six others.
[36:24.98]This is just to give us an idea of what's going on.
[36:27.48]Quarantine them.
[36:30.13]Mom?
[36:30.96]Wait, that was me.
[36:31.76]Oh, I got like a... It's alright.
[36:32.98]Come here, love.
[36:34.56]My first piece of gameplay was saying mom.
[36:38.04]What's the matter?
[36:38.60]I can't sleep.
[36:40.70]It's alright.
[36:42.18]You know, if you stay in your room, you'll be safe.
[36:45.06]Talking about real gameplay here.
[36:48.15]Mom.
[36:52.07]Okay.
[36:52.81]I don't like it here.

[37:31.61]I don't like it here.
[37:33.23]Well, that's too bad, dude.
[37:36.31]You have to deal with it.
[37:37.53]I don't like it here.
[37:38.79]Shut up!
[37:44.30]Radiation warning map.
[37:46.80]War room, main office, room 2.
[37:48.58]So this is just like Fallout.

[38:06.28]Alright, let's open this.

[42:47.23]We have to go back up.
[42:50.93]Ow, my ears.

[43:58.37]I know where one is.
[43:59.53]Downstairs.
[43:59.99]I remember seeing one.
[44:06.39]NBC.
[44:06.89]Wait, does mom have an NBC suit?
[44:13.89]Hey, Mr. Hoon.
[44:15.28]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[44:16.42]Happy 44th birthday.
[44:17.76]Well, thank you.
[44:18.26]Well, here's mom.
[44:18.92]She's fine.
[44:23.08]I gotta go down.
[44:23.86]There's a suit.
[44:25.48]Wasn't there a suit downstairs?
[44:26.42]There was a suit right next to me.
[44:28.28]What?
[44:31.00]Oh, the one downstairs was taken?
[44:32.34]Well, where's the fucking NBC suit?
[44:41.83]Was it?
[44:44.67]Well, why did it get... Just hurry up.
[44:47.11]Get upstairs.
[44:51.11]Go back up there.
[44:51.75]So, guys, I think you were wrong.
[44:52.67]Why am I getting, like, predator vision?
[44:53.93]What?
[45:16.77]This is just like weird guy has issues.
[45:19.78]Where's like the monsters?
[45:22.70]There is a monster in this game.
[45:24.36]There is.
[45:35.46]Air conditioning mode.
[45:36.65]Okay, level three.
[45:48.96]So I need to go to level four.
[45:50.12]There's probably a suit in here.
[45:51.44]Alright.
[46:00.72]These really are just levels.
[46:03.80]It's not like top to bottom levels.
[46:06.69]It's just levels.
[46:08.53]It's just level one, level two.
[46:09.93]We're on level three now.
[46:10.87]It's like Super Mario Brothers.
[46:13.33]The War Room.
[46:21.86]We're getting a whole lot of lore here.
[46:25.30]I would much rather have... Like... Oh, okay, which one?
[46:40.97]Uh... Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.
[46:44.09]Catch... It's always gonna be the left one, because that was when I picked the right time.
[46:48.31]It's an honor, sir.
[46:54.22]I thought somebody just threw something at me.
[46:55.72]Uh-oh, here we go.
[46:56.30]This is where I'm going to see somebody get his head cut off.
[46:59.08]This guy's going to get his face ripped off.
[47:05.80]I don't know.
[47:07.66]It's not radiation poisoning.
[47:10.28]The water's clean.
[47:11.46]The air is clean.
[47:12.44]It's not the food.
[47:15.66]Yet the symptoms...
[47:18.04]Gun right in the face.
[47:18.92]Why is he not looking at him?
[47:20.48]I mean, I understand it's an interesting, like, cinematography shot.
[47:23.12]That's why they had him turned around.
[47:25.32]So he could turn around and dramatically grab him.
[47:49.50]I had to get my toy.
[47:54.06]I'm just an edgelord, I'm sorry.
[47:58.52]It's full of edgelords and I'm trying to be just like them.
[48:03.43]What am I doing?
[48:04.01]Alright, well, I... Let's just go get the damn suit.
[48:21.92]Let's just get in the suit, please.
[48:22.96]Emergency access only.
[48:24.10]This door will open automatically in the event of an emergency.
[48:26.90]Well, let's go in here.
[48:34.89]This is a horror game, by the way.
[48:36.95]Let's be clear about that.
[48:44.11]Okay, well, there you go.
[48:51.60]There's the suit.
[48:56.79]Wait, that was me killing somebody else.
[48:59.03]Or, I don't know.
[48:59.79]Alright, suit up, dude.
[49:09.37]Alright, uh... Protective clothing.
[49:12.05]Respiratory equipment radiation detection.
[49:16.57]NBC suit safety guidelines.
[49:19.50]This is what you have to wear when you work at, like, NBC Studios.
[49:24.26]In the event of you getting a job at NBC, please put on a hazmat suit.
[49:30.36]Okay, let's go.
[49:30.96]Let's get out of here.
[49:38.31]This door only opens in an emergency.
[49:40.43]Well, smash a fucking window or something, dude.
[49:42.51]What do you want me to do?
[49:47.69]Here it comes.
[49:49.81]Not like another vision.
[49:50.89]Let's just open the door.
[49:53.79]What?
[49:57.05]Oh.
[49:57.56]Okay, well I got my toy.
[50:03.56]Does that mean I have everything now?
[50:07.58]I don't have everything, I guess.
[50:08.70]Okay, well.
[50:12.60]What is all this?
[50:21.16]This is like an outbreak.
[50:22.18]There's thousands of people dead.
[50:23.78]Okay, got you.
[50:28.40]Am I missing something from over here?
[50:29.86]Or in here?
[50:32.88]Put on the suit.
[50:33.86]How do I put the suit on?
[50:35.84]Do I have to go in my inventory?
[50:41.54]Nope, nope.
[50:42.06]I can all go in this bag.
[50:46.29]Somebody's fucking lunch.
[50:50.55]Did I get it?
[50:52.49]I guess I got it.
[50:55.49]There we go.
[51:04.22]I'm waiting for the scariness.
[51:09.18]I think I've completed the tutorial.
[51:10.66]I've got my suit.
[51:11.58]I've got my backpack with my lunch in it.
[51:15.02]I'm ready to go.
[51:20.70]Now I can go downstairs.
[51:25.13]And bury an axe in somebody's head.
[51:26.67]Because I just... Okay.
[51:33.27]This is where the game starts.
[51:34.71]Game begins now.
[51:35.75]I'm the murderer.
[51:36.43]I'm gonna go kill people.
[51:49.07]This just turns into an FPS.
[51:51.57]Level four.
[51:56.90]It's not going to get better.
[51:58.22]Yes, it is.
[51:58.96]Of course it is.
[52:07.50]Full of fog.
[52:09.82]Loud.
[52:14.92]Very loud.
[52:17.32]Thank you, Purple, for the $15.
[52:20.32]Waiting with fucking bated breath for the nine-foot-tall armored super mutant to jump and crit you with a fat man.
[52:28.40]Yes, it is a horror game.
[52:29.17]You have to go through the eight levels of incredible boredom.
[52:33.17]What kind of air conditioning unit is this?
[52:38.69]Like, what?
[52:42.90]The AC is having issues.
[52:44.30]Yeah, more than that.
[52:50.48]More documents.
[52:59.73]Nice fake voice of like an old man.
[53:04.79]That was a guy trying to do an old man as hard as he could.
[53:10.75]Critical fault detected in the infiltration system.
[53:12.89]Disconnect pressure at main value.
[53:14.51]Okay.
[53:16.91]Repraise the filter immediately.
[53:18.75]You got it.
[53:20.79]Filter effectiveness is at, like, zero.
[53:22.69]Okay.
[53:23.77]Press Enter.
[53:25.19]That'll solve it.
[53:36.02]Oh, Jesus!
[53:39.96]I wasn't supposed to do that!
[53:44.24]Oh, come on.
[53:44.88]No, it's not... Get over there.
[53:52.66]Turn it off.
[53:54.98]How do I turn this shit off?
[53:56.80]Oh my god, it's loud.
[53:58.18]Please.
[54:02.04]Oh my god.
[54:03.36]Climb this.
[54:04.42]Please.
[54:06.20]This hurts so much.
[54:09.30]Twist it.
[54:09.72]I have to... Okay, good.
[54:15.44]You got it.
[54:23.77]I'm getting... I have no words.
[54:31.88]What?
[54:39.48]Okay.
[54:40.16]Now... I can go over here.
[54:43.51]They're getting sprayed.
[54:50.00]Alright, so what I have to do... These are clearly added.
[54:52.98]That means I need to do something with it.
[54:54.08]Open up this.
[54:54.58]I guess I can't open this up.
[55:09.75]Okay, just... Use your hand and unscrew it, please.
[55:17.53]Heavy breathing.
[55:22.43]Just wait till we get introduced to all the other characters in the game.
[55:25.99]Oh, great.
[55:28.63]Popcorn's done!
[55:31.51]I gotta insert a popcorn joke here, because maybe we'll, you know.
[55:40.20]This is just like bees.
[55:41.32]I'm like running a beehive.
[55:45.46]That's so dirty.
[55:49.82]-2.
[55:53.43]Wow, I'm holding this thing such a dickhead.
[55:55.45]Uh, what about over here?
[55:57.29]The spare filters.
[55:59.17]I need to get rid of this damaged filter first.
[56:01.45]Throw it on the ground, man.
[56:02.99]Yeah, I got minor rad coding.
[56:12.85]I gotta take some rad X. Alright, get the new filter.
[56:17.71]This is just a series of mundane tasks that I don't want to do.
[56:25.68]Look at this thing.
[56:26.84]Let's break that down for a second.
[56:28.06]That's a fucking dryer filter.
[56:32.18]That's not going to collect radiation.
[56:34.90]I don't get it.
[56:45.41]Alright, take out the other one.
[56:48.35]Maybe not.
[56:59.46]How about a horror game?
[57:02.20]Replace a dirty dryer filter.
[57:05.56]Oh, this is scary.
[57:06.30]I need to turn the pressure valve back on.
[57:08.56]Yeah, you do.
[57:11.29]Go back over here.
[57:12.17]Turn it on.
[57:23.39]Main pressure valve.
[57:24.65]Everything's named.
[57:25.21]It's going to break, isn't it?
[57:29.41]They wouldn't do it this way.
[57:30.40]You don't like having that much trouble standing on the ladder?
[57:35.36]Uh-oh, it won't budge.
[57:42.10]Oh.
[57:42.30]Why?
[57:42.58]Oh.
[57:42.66]Oh, that was his arm.
[57:56.75]Just another day in Grommet Town.
[58:17.30]He's coming!
[58:26.25]It's me, like, murdering people.
[58:29.11]Alright, let's hold on.
[58:29.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:30.51]What the fuck is going on?
[58:33.01]I need to pay attention.
[58:36.31]People running away from me?
[58:44.09]I have a broken arm.
[58:48.73]I get it.
[58:58.80]Oh, there's a real issue here.
[59:00.74]I think I really sprained it.
[59:04.25]Ow.
[59:05.31]I fell off a four foot high ladder and I'm such a fucking goofy doofus that I broke my fucking arm.
[59:14.26]If you fall from that height and you break your arm, like, come on.
[59:17.98]Drink some goddamn milk.
[59:19.94]Your calcium levels are like way off the charts low.
[59:31.05]What if I wasn't such a doofus?
[59:39.02]Alright, like, you know what?
[59:39.92]I need some more vitamin B. That, like, actually hurt.
[59:53.87]That's how you can sell a real actor.
[59:55.47]They fucking put their body on the line.
[60:01.52]Okay, almost there.
[60:06.79]Watch, we're going to be making all these jokes, and then he's going to pull it out, and it's going to be like a bone shooting through.
[60:12.39]Okay.
[60:39.31]This just doesn't fit at all
[61:18.78]What a fucking terrible fucking Balls and Gromit episode.
[61:30.52]What am I doing?
[61:31.90]Alright, enough of the gas, man.
[61:34.56]Seriously.
[61:37.07]I'm about to do, like, surgery.
[61:38.41]Alright, that's enough gas, man.
[61:40.25]You don't need that much.
[61:45.59]Oh god, here we go.
[61:50.60]I'm sorry.
[61:54.65]I'm sorry.
[62:01.97]Alright, that's enough.
[62:04.14]I'm not doing that again.
[62:05.34]I'm not going to do that again.
[62:06.36]Wait, I got to say a word.
[62:09.53]And she's no better.
[62:10.93]Vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, liver pain, it's got to be... It can't be radiation sickness.
[62:16.07]Look, these... Of course it can.
[62:19.03]Am I really sorry, though?
[62:20.45]Not really, you're right.
[62:21.35]It's built by the lowest bidder.
[62:23.16]No one thought there'd be a real war.
[62:25.12]I say that, I'm gonna do it again.
[62:27.16]Honestly, George, do you... You better believe I'm gonna do that again.
[62:30.24]Oh, cracking toast, Robin.
[62:31.96]I'm sorry.
[62:34.04]No, don't worry.
[62:35.13]We've all been under a lot of pressure.
[62:38.37]What is... I don't know.
[62:38.93]What's the stealth gameplay that decided to pop up now?
[62:41.61]How do they not see him?
[62:42.63]Don't you know, in any video game, if you're crouched behind any object, you don't exist.
[62:49.51]Oh!
[63:07.21]Something's wrong with this person.
[63:17.77]I was... I was about to do it.
[63:20.47]I was very close to doing it, guys.
[63:22.17]I'm not kidding.
[63:23.37]Alright, now what?
[63:29.59]Do we use the ointment that we were just talking about?
[63:33.76]Yep.
[63:42.87]Don't do it, Jeremiah.
[63:43.85]I fucking hate you.
[63:45.91]I'm not gonna do it.
[63:48.18]Oh god, hold on.
[63:51.86]Why a ruler?
[63:55.30]What's the ruler have to do with this?
[64:06.36]What do I... Oh, I have to, like... Oh, it's making a splint.
[64:08.99]I get it.
[64:16.03]Yep.
[64:16.89]Easy.
[64:18.23]Wrap it up.
[64:18.71]Oh, okay.
[64:23.83]So he's good.
[64:26.19]Well, good for now.
[64:27.38]He's gonna puke.
[64:31.66]Come on, do it.
[64:37.40]This game is difficult.
[64:38.44]Uh, I mean, sort of.
[64:47.07]It's a very difficult video game.
[64:49.73]I can attest to that.
[64:55.53]It's an experience.
[64:57.31]I'm just waiting for, like, the room full of people that all, like, are gonna die or something, right?
[65:02.01]Isn't that usually how these work?
[65:05.03]Like, see there.
[65:10.03]Are we in a submarine?
[65:11.13]I don't get it.
[65:18.67]Every- the whole place is filling with radiation now.
[65:25.49]Good morning.
[65:27.43]Main air filtration system offline.
[65:30.53]Input.
[65:31.27]Oh, N.A.
[65:32.07]Aim.
[65:32.41]Oh, N.A.
[65:32.93]Target.
[65:33.47]N.A.
[65:33.81]Aim.
[65:34.17]Okay.
[65:43.82]What?
[65:44.10]What?
[65:44.20]Something I don't understand is when I have to tap the button to think... I saw something.
[65:53.67]Apparently I saw something I didn't like.
[65:56.45]Cracking bones grommet.
[65:58.97]Radiation.
[66:03.55]Evacuate the bunker.
[66:08.54]Look at that Twitch lingo.
[66:28.94]Now we're gonna meet the other characters.
[66:31.28]Yep, see?
[66:38.08]More of this.
[66:42.36]Keep your head down.
[66:44.88]Jan, what are you doing here?
[66:51.68]You're supposed to stay... If you open that door, we'll all be dead.
[66:56.68]I was just exploring.
[66:58.17]Oh, Jan.
[66:59.61]Exploring.
[67:00.01]I want that door sealed shut immediately.
[67:04.86]I mean, I need to... For Christ's sake, Margaret.
[67:07.38]When do I get to make choices?
[67:09.54]Keep your little shit in his quarters before he explores the wrong place and gets us all killed.
[67:17.25]Okay.
[67:19.65]Seal that door immediately!
[67:21.35]I wonder if that's supposed to be Dad.
[67:28.27]Maybe.
[67:29.71]Okay, well, I have to go down this hall.
[67:32.26]Well, maybe it'll do it for me.
[67:41.14]Uh, well, let's just go this way.
[67:46.50]Down the spooky hallway.
[67:51.55]Giant door, okay.
[67:53.63]Am I gonna get outside or something?
[67:58.15]This probably can't be opened.
[68:00.99]I think this weak-ass motherfucker's gonna be able to open this door.
[68:08.34]This guy fell off of a stepladder and broke a bunch of bones.
[68:11.90]You think he's going to be able to lift that?
[68:26.47]What?
[68:26.57]You're on the wrong part.
[68:28.09]Wasn't he on the wrong part?
[68:32.33]Shouldn't he be like... I can't get out this way.
[68:37.74]How is he?
[68:38.74]PJ, please put the oxytanks back in the cupboard and lock it when you're done with the weld.
[68:44.48]Don't leave Bishop on my back about this as well.
[68:47.38]Be sparing with fuel.
[68:49.83]Yeah, okay, goodbye.
[68:51.19]I should just keep trying.
[68:54.89]Well, we can't go this way.
[69:02.11]Do I need a wrench for this one too?
[69:06.05]Someone's face is going to be right there.
[69:15.62]No?
[69:15.78]Where are the other survivors?
[69:17.16]I'm sick of, like, doing child flashbacks.
[69:21.66]Oh, shit, eggshells.
[69:22.56]No.
[69:26.67]Oh, come right when I say it, too.
[69:38.04]I'm the only survivor?
[69:39.26]I don't think so.
[69:40.82]Did he get in?
[69:43.21]This fucking noise.
[70:06.45]nobody picked up the glass after like 45 years I don't the hazmat is the monster I mean I made like a Batman dark knight joke already that was the dark knight sound that plays all the time in that movie
[70:35.66]That's like the Batman is on the road driving really fast sound.
[70:42.93]Emergency exit only.
[70:44.25]Okay, well let's go.
[70:48.54]I'm doing this again.
[70:49.24]What the hell?
[70:49.88]What is this?
[70:50.46]What is... The radiation is chasing me.
[70:53.94]I know, like, what?
[70:54.50]Never.
[71:17.49]20 or 30 years.
[71:17.99]Okay, so I should be able to get out.
[71:24.19]Sam, can we last that long?
[71:28.03]Do we have enough food?
[71:31.27]Yes, it'll be alright.
[71:32.31]We may have to ration a little, but it'll be alright.
[71:40.72]Alright.
[71:47.57]So, everybody dies.
[71:50.05]Maybe I killed them or something.
[71:51.63]I'm like one of those weird guys.
[71:54.71]I murdered everybody, I guess.
[71:57.13]That's what happened.
[71:59.42]I grew up, I was hazmat suit murderer, and it's gonna show through my eyes, me killing everybody.
[72:04.74]I already know how this game ends.
[72:11.36]Main office war room.
[72:13.08]Okay.
[72:16.72]Fire escape.
[72:17.86]To go out the door, I guess, sir.
[72:19.22]Alright.
[72:39.01]What is this?
[72:40.41]I got Winston Churchill.
[72:41.49]He likes smoking cigars.
[72:42.91]Okay.
[72:44.42]These are all people I already know.
[72:46.34]These are all like the survivors and they're all dead and I'm the one who killed them.
[72:54.54]How the fuck do I get out of here then?
[73:08.80]I can't leave through there.
[73:10.16]So how the fuck do I leave?
[73:12.62]Gotta go to the box.
[73:19.52]Fire exit stairs.
[73:20.76]Where is it?
[73:21.38]Oh, there it is.
[73:31.19]Dude, this isn't even like a horror movie.
[73:33.45]I thought this was supposed to be like a horror game.
[73:42.08]See if he can do it on his own.
[73:45.58]What's going on with his hand?
[73:47.14]Look at his hand.
[73:48.70]Look at that.
[73:49.16]Look at that, like, rubber hand.
[73:51.02]That was like a rubber chicken.
[73:52.18]Look at this hand.
[73:56.11]That is not a hand.
[74:06.23]Alright, let's go.
[74:07.09]Get it open.
[74:07.41]Hurry up.
[74:13.52]Look at this arm.
[74:18.46]Look at that fake hand.
[74:20.30]I love it.
[74:26.27]I love it.
[74:27.21]Are there, like, wires in there?
[74:28.49]Alright.
[74:37.41]Are we, like, almost done with this game?
[74:43.26]How much longer do you think this is going to be?
[74:48.90]Oh, who put butter all over this?
[74:51.24]Unbelievable.
[74:52.84]I just, somebody put grease on here.
[74:56.02]Who would put olive oil all over the fucking door handle?
[74:59.03]What kind of madman?
[75:01.23]I just can't seem to get my finger rid of it.
[75:04.69]Shit.
[75:09.81]Finally.
[75:14.50]-2.
[75:15.04]What?
[75:15.48]That was good.
[75:16.02]That was a good one.
[75:21.01]Good comedy.
[75:21.69]Come on, that was comedy.
[75:24.37]You better believe it.
[75:25.23]You bet your ass it was.
[75:30.44]Now this is horror.
[75:41.18]Use one of the click events as a stream starting soon background.
[75:45.88]That's actually Fucking perfect.
[75:48.72]That is absolute gold.
[75:50.36]I'm gonna have to do that That's perfect they came trying to open that hatch is just like go for like four minutes How would you I
[76:23.04]No shit I love that crunch noise that was like a disgusting noise I
[76:50.62]I need to keep this on the screen for like a minute.
[76:59.52]Because this is going to be a starting soon screen, I feel like it's perfect, right?
[77:05.85]So bear with me here while this gets recorded so I can keep it forever.
[77:10.73]Here we go.
[77:16.21]Like the stream is inside of that hatch, you know what I mean?
[77:26.66]Stream's in there somewhere.
[77:27.84]And eventually, like, you get to the stream.
[77:41.93]Is that a guy on the left?
[77:44.89]What was that?
[77:45.31]Oh, that was his shadow.
[78:00.46]Why wouldn't he just wipe his hands off?
[78:01.94]Yeah, wipe your hands on your pants.
[78:08.55]Or like, you know, put it in your mouth and spit on it or something.
[78:16.28]Okay, good.
[78:17.20]That's good.
[78:17.56]We got it.
[78:22.42]Nice job.
[78:24.18]This game is only two hours long.
[78:25.58]Are we like almost done with the game?
[78:32.53]He represents chat.
[78:34.15]See, now the stream is finally starting.
[78:37.05]And sometimes you get in there and you just fucking fall.
[78:39.88]You know what I mean?
[78:40.30]Because the stream sucks.
[78:41.86]I've been there before.
[78:42.88]I know what that's like.
[78:44.94]Add the music.
[78:45.62]Thank you, Blong96 for the 10 bucks.
[78:49.48]Thank you, AvailableUsername888 for the 2 bucks.
[78:52.35]Great stream, man.
[78:52.99]I had so much fun.
[78:53.51]Well, thank you.
[78:56.29]No, don't make him fall again.
[78:57.23]I don't want to do that whole thing again.
[79:01.56]This guy's got the most slippery fucking hands.
[79:12.77]There we go.
[79:14.21]Oh, I fell.
[79:17.23]No, we're good.
[79:19.92]Everything's fine.
[79:21.84]I kept my hand on.
[79:26.74]What's with this guy and ladders?
[79:27.76]It's weird.
[79:29.44]Every time this guy gets on a ladder, he falls off.
[79:35.31]He's climbing with one arm.
[79:36.09]I can climb with one arm.
[79:39.59]Just got to use a little bit more body strength.
[79:44.47]Come on.
[79:53.83]What else is going to happen here?
[79:58.69]Are we sincerely getting close to the end of the game?
[80:01.41]I'm going to be very disappointed.
[80:06.00]This will be a very clear do not recommend.
[80:07.86]Yeah, guys, sorry.
[80:15.73]I'm calling it.
[80:17.01]I'm calling it.
[80:23.65]Even the guy on the recording wants this to be over.
[80:28.14]Oh, here's another starting soon screen.
[80:29.70]Hold on.
[80:33.70]This guy just has so much trouble opening things.
[80:46.43]You can just, like, put these together.
[80:47.95]This game is worth the screen caps.
[80:56.95]Alright, here we go.
[80:57.77]Now I figured out how to open doors.
[81:02.76]Oh, that's how you do it.
[81:03.78]You just put a little pressure.
[81:05.29]Wow, I was just grabbing it and moving my hand around and butter fingering it.
[81:11.91]That's how you open up doors.
[81:13.10]Sometimes I forget.
[81:13.90]Okay.
[81:18.92]Level five.
[81:30.25]Have him eating food on the toilet as a tea break.
[81:35.99]That's dumb.
[81:40.12]Like, where is this game going?
[81:45.34]Another hatch.
[81:51.68]This time I don't need to... Or do I?
[81:58.45]Wow, he gave up.
[82:00.31]Doesn't even need me to, uh... But me and my mother was still alive, though.
[82:13.78]That's what I don't understand.
[82:22.56]Well, now I remember.
[82:23.44]I have to get the thing on the wall.
[82:36.79]Didn't even need my help, apparently.
[82:38.21]So what was... I didn't even need to do that at all.
[82:50.09]That's a flashlight.
[82:54.23]Wow, this guy's been down here for way too long.
[82:58.73]torch alright this is just a series of guy can't open thing right have we done anything else besides like guy fumbles around not able to open doors and hatches or levers or valves there's this whole game
[83:34.23]Nothing else has happened in the whole game.
[83:47.64]I got my last little sack boy.
[83:54.38]Yeah, we fixed a couple of appliances and fell down a couple of ladders.
[83:59.23]Oh, come on, really?
[84:01.53]Should I sit here for this one, too?
[84:07.28]No, this one's boring.
[84:13.07]This one's hard.
[84:36.65]Alright, so I go down there, obviously.
[84:46.48]Joke incoming.
[84:48.24]No, not yet.
[84:49.28]No, that's not true.
[84:55.80]Here comes the music.
[84:57.82]Oh.
[84:58.62]Well, I ain't getting back up.
[85:03.31]No, that's my last one.
[85:04.73]I hate that one.
[85:07.11]What the fuck is this?
[85:19.66]What?
[85:25.27]What else is in this game?
[85:27.07]I'm seriously disappointed.
[85:29.20]I really thought this was going to be a bunch of horror movie stuff.
[85:31.86]It's just this guy fumbling around.
[85:34.40]Nothing else is happening.
[85:45.76]He's really strong now.
[85:46.80]That was like fucking 400 pounds.
[85:50.45]Well, if we're this far, we have to see the end of this game, right?
[85:53.07]We have to.
[85:59.15]Anything else around the corners?
[86:01.75]Don't we need to know what happens here?
[86:05.47]We're this far.
[86:07.09]It's important to know.
[86:13.52]We need to see the end.
[86:23.13]Has this guy had a gun the whole time?
[86:26.54]He's holding the keys.
[86:27.72]Here comes the mask.
[86:28.64]Oh, who could have guessed?
[86:30.42]It was bald, bad, mean guy the whole game.
[86:32.96]Rat.
[86:33.08]Mm-hmm.
[86:54.62]Wait, who hit who there?
[87:04.81]I'm gonna get an opportunity to stab him!
[87:15.18]Stab him in the back!
[87:17.16]He's a bad guy!
[87:18.52]What a twist!
[87:25.08]Get him!
[87:26.90]Oh, no, he... That's not how it happened.
[87:33.41]That's not how it happened.
[87:35.85]Okay, come on.
[87:40.81]What a shitty way to make that... No, I don't want to do this again.
[87:43.51]Skip it.
[87:43.99]How do I skip it?
[87:48.30]God damn it.
[87:51.44]This really is just a movie.
[87:57.47]Why would I give you a way out, Martin?
[88:00.35]That can't be how it happened.
[88:01.62]You and the little rat are not going to leave.
[88:08.72]You can play Prince of Persia.
[88:10.34]I mean, that game's cool.
[88:11.66]We're all going to die down here.
[88:18.99]And now you're going to get fucking strangled.
[88:21.23]That's right.
[88:27.87]Ain't nobody gonna save you now.
[88:32.19]I got a full set of janitor keys.
[88:38.44]And... Get him!
[88:40.94]Stop doing that to my mom!
[88:43.66]Oh no, I got a gun!
[88:44.70]Where did I get the gun?
[88:59.97]It's okay.
[89:01.73]No one can hurt us.
[89:04.87]No, I'm sorry.
[89:06.07]I did it.
[89:09.60]I killed him.
[89:20.64]I kind of can't wait for this to be over.
[89:32.52]Yeah, what else is there?
[89:33.84]Is he a zombie now?
[89:37.98]I understand where they were going with this, but... Plenty of this, too.
[89:47.81]Just slow walking down, like, a weirdly lit hallway.
[89:57.41]Okay, like... No unauthorized persons allowed within this area, sure.
[90:06.69]Well, there's obviously, like, the whole place is going down.
[90:11.87]I mean, like, open this door, I guess.
[90:16.31]There's a fucking keypad.
[90:18.12]Great.
[90:21.78]Do I have the key code?
[90:24.10]I don't.
[90:24.46]Probably it was in, like, some note somewhere.
[90:26.30]Who cares?
[90:27.36]I'm gonna do a flashback and remember it.
[90:29.14]Watch.
[90:29.34]783-387-7385, whatever.
[90:45.71]It's just a generic bunker story.
[90:49.19]But we have to see how it ends.
[90:50.51]What is it?
[90:51.83]Show it.
[90:52.47]It's alright, John.
[90:54.93]It's over.
[90:55.41]We're safe here.
[90:57.03]That's all that matters.
[90:58.99]As long as I'm here, I'll look after you.
[91:01.42]Nothing can hurt us now.
[91:04.16]Yes, Molly.
[91:05.66]Okay, so he just walks outside.
[91:15.84]alright nice so they I didn't even see what it was all I know is it's a combination of like seven eight and three alright there's blood on the keypad yeah I know I need the code maybe I can work out I can work out I don't know the code
[91:56.19]Maybe I can work out the code.
[91:59.03]I need the code.
[92:00.33]So this one was pressed more than once.
[92:06.92]There's blood on the keypad.
[92:09.96]I don't know the code.
[92:13.11]Maybe I can work out the code.
[92:21.16]There's blood on the keyboard.
[92:24.20]I need the code.
[92:24.98]Go by the amount of ketchup.
[92:37.55]I'm sorry.
[92:43.21]I'm like, let's go.
[92:45.15]Like, what the fuck?
[92:46.91]I'm getting really like kind of irritated by this.
[92:52.36]Something has to happen here.
[92:53.42]This whole stream has been like a Wallace and Gromit joke.
[93:00.38]Like four or five separate times.
[93:20.83]Now what?
[93:25.71]Is there a monster here now?
[93:34.40]Wait.
[93:34.88]Are you telling me this guy's alive?
[93:38.78]How is the guy alive?
[93:40.06]He just shot you.
[93:40.62]Somebody shot him.
[93:41.36]I shot him.
[93:58.88]You guys... Oh, what a good place for Wallace and Gromit.
[94:05.12]Fucking intro theme song.
[94:07.76]Too bad I used it too much.
[94:10.48]I used it too much.
[94:12.82]Can't do it.
[94:14.44]No, it's been overused.
[94:18.21]Oh, it would be perfect right now.
[94:19.53]It would be perfect.
[94:25.61]I can't do it.
[94:31.45]No, I have self-control now.
[94:33.69]I can't use it.
[94:34.83]It's way too much.
[94:37.13]I'm gonna play the rest of the game.
[94:53.68]Somebody's gonna wake up and... This guy is such a klutz.
[95:04.87]I killed everybody.
[95:21.30]Take off this one.
[95:22.76]The body bag's gonna be a scary guy.
[95:30.54]And it's just a bunch of green jello.
[95:33.26]Why would I put my hand in there?
[95:34.38]What am I putting my hand in there for?
[95:39.23]I'm just being gross.
[95:48.35]Okay.
[95:52.54]What else am I supposed to do here?
[95:59.27]Oh, over here, apparently.
[96:08.26]Somebody's shoes were just moving.
[96:23.84]You killed us.
[96:25.66]You killed us, Jake.
[96:28.17]Why did you kill us?
[96:30.39]Why did you turn the gas on?
[96:38.70]A skeleton!
[96:50.15]They're all coming to get me.
[96:53.53]They're all coming to get me!
[96:56.30]I need to get out of here!
[97:15.51]There's a lot of great gifts here.
[97:18.19]There are so many fantastic gifts that you can pull from this game.
[97:27.37]Okay, I gotta let this play out for a minute, because this is like a Scare Saturdays, like, scary game night thing, right?
[97:33.12]Pretty great gif.
[97:37.50]Okay.
[97:38.72]I just got barked at.
[97:47.11]It's so fucking loud, too.
[97:48.83]I wish it wasn't this loud.
[97:58.60]Ah!
[97:59.60]Shut up!
[98:39.50]Is that from Star Wars?
[98:47.89]What did I do?
[98:48.51]I burnt my hand?
[98:55.66]When you reach level five, find the ventilation hatch.
[98:59.27]I'm trying, guys.
[99:00.15]I'm trying to make them.
[99:01.03]I promise.
[99:01.23]I kind of gave up at this point.
[99:02.93]You know what I mean?
[99:03.93]Good boy.
[99:05.67]Be careful.
[99:06.07]At this point, we're just watching a shitty movie.
[99:09.11]That's pretty much what happened.
[99:31.06]Now I gotta control the kid.
[99:38.46]Play the meatball parade?
[99:41.40]What do you want me to play?
[99:42.34]Find the hot pipe.
[99:46.40]Possible music.
[99:47.42]Let's see.
[99:47.88]Find the hot pipe.
[99:50.36]I don't know what this is.
[99:51.14]Find the hot pipe.
[99:55.30]I would have to find the hot pipe, apparently.
[99:57.80]What is this?
[99:58.16]What do you want me to play here?
[100:04.32]Holy mack, what is this?
[100:06.96]What am I playing right now?
[100:08.40]I love how we're just playing fucking random songs.
[100:13.83]I haven't paid attention to the game in like fucking five minutes.
[100:17.41]What is this?
[100:21.69]What is this?
[100:25.46]What the fuck is this?
[100:29.62]This doesn't fit at all.
[100:33.09]Is this the right link?
[100:35.63]That... I don't understand.
[100:56.64]was so long that whole cutscene was this whole game is a cutscene by the way yeah that turns into the bubbly oh wow that's so funny oh yeah we were the ones that poisoned everybody we did it it was us
[101:34.72]That's just a sound effect stream.
[101:41.50]I've lost control, guys.
[101:43.24]I don't have control anymore.
[101:45.24]I just gotta stop.
[101:46.01]Oh, hey, look, we can float!
[101:46.89]Look at this one!
[102:02.07]I just kind of want this to be over, to be honest.
[102:14.52]Why am I doing this?
[102:17.06]What does this have to do with it?
[102:18.08]Why did I want to fucking search for this?
[102:21.34]Was there a reason for this?
[102:22.32]The time has come.
[102:24.60]For this cookie!
[102:30.24]Why did I just search for cookie monster eating cookies?
[102:33.64]The time has come.
[102:34.64]I can't stop it.
[102:35.94]For this cookie!
[102:39.04]It's like it's the keys.
[102:44.84]That's not right.
[102:49.34]I gotta get the right key.
[102:50.46]The time has come.
[102:52.79]For this cookie!
[102:56.13]Is this the right key?
[103:04.93]Okay, good.
[103:07.79]Alright, this sucks.
[103:08.81]I'm done with this shit.
[103:09.77]I'm fucking done.
[103:11.81]This is like a next level of fucking sucks.
[103:16.26]I'm closing out of all the shit.
[103:18.49]We're done with all fucking sound effects.
[103:20.15]Don't lick me anymore shit.
[103:21.73]No more links.
[103:22.57]No more fucking music.
[103:24.15]I understand that we're trying to pass the time here.
[103:27.07]But like, this is it.
[103:30.09]You can only go so far.
[103:32.46]Before you fucking go too far.
[103:41.61]No, I'm trying to close the window, okay?
[103:45.65]I closed it.
[103:46.23]It's over.
[103:46.61]I closed the window.
[103:47.37]I just reloaded Mozilla and fucking refreshed the page.
[103:58.69]This is so dragged out.
[103:59.93]Jesus Christ.
[104:10.39]We went too far when we started playing this game.
[104:12.35]You know, you actually have a point there.
[104:20.02]I really don't even know what I'm supposed to be looking for either.
[104:26.68]This whole game is just a cutscene to get over the refund timer.
[104:35.43]These people aren't even real.
[104:36.61]This is so dumb.
[104:45.43]Feed us!
[104:46.43]We're all dogs!
[104:48.09]Oh, please.
[104:48.71]I wanna go outside!
[104:54.41]I have to pee!
[105:00.98]Okay, yep.
[105:02.06]That works.
[105:02.62]That was long.
[105:17.03]I'm trying to... I'm sorry, guys.
[105:20.89]The last, like, 40... The whole stream has just been, like, a bunch of fucking shitty jokes.

[108:43.34]And then we're going to be sad because we're at the credits.
[108:52.45]This game that wasn't a game was barely a movie.
[108:55.05]This wasn't even a movie.
[108:57.61]Like it's one of those interactive games.
[109:00.37]Interactive movies.
[109:03.63]I don't know about this one.

[109:56.23]So we killed everybody.
[109:57.24]And we're the ones that poisoned everyone.
[110:01.68]My mother poisoned everybody.

[110:33.02]You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[110:49.90]See?
[110:59.47]There's too much music.
[111:00.79]There's too... There's too much music.
[111:02.94]Hold on.

[111:15.76]Turn off music.
[111:18.19]Here we go.

[111:38.56]I'm supposed to stay or leave?
[111:40.62]Alright, come on, go.
[111:58.19]Did I make it out?
[112:16.98]Okay, we're done.
[112:18.08]Alright, let's see their song.
[112:31.79]Pretty much is the same music.
[112:33.91]Alright, well, that was... That was... That was just awful.
[112:37.54]Like, I mean, like, let's... I'm going to be real with you.
[112:39.52]Like, that was just awful.
[112:42.88]That was, like, in the top...
[112:45.63]That was just... There's no way to fucking... There's no long and short of it.
[112:49.61]That was an awful experience.
[112:53.27]Hour and 52 minutes.
[112:56.40]We pretty much just laughed at Wallace and Grom.
[112:58.74]It skipped as shit.
[112:59.66]Anything else?
[113:02.46]No, we got a new game.
[113:03.48]No bonus features?
[113:04.62]No behind the scenes with the director?
[113:05.78]That's fucking bullshit.
[113:13.17]Live refund.
[113:14.17]No, no, no.
[113:16.49]It was like an hour and a half, two hour long experience.
[113:18.65]It was a movie.
[113:20.57]It's alright.
[113:21.93]I mean, they put money into it.
[113:23.43]Obviously, did you hear the fucking theme song at the end?
[113:28.21]Alright, so now we're going to go to... I'm going to take a break here.
[113:32.84]I'm going to change games.
[113:33.58]I'm going to go to the one that was in second place, which is Dr. Becker or Decker, whatever the hell it is.
[113:40.76]So, give me a minute.
[113:44.38]We're going to do Dr. Decker.
[113:48.48]Which is another FMV game, but I think this one's a little bit more interactive.
[113:53.57]So give me a minute while I set it up.
[113:55.85]I'll be right back.
[113:56.31]Gonna pee, gonna refill my drink.
[113:58.92]And we will get to the next game.
[114:01.96]See you in a minute.
