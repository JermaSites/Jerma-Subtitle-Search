[00:15.77]But thank you, Boo, for the sub.
[00:16.75]Thank you, everybody, for the resubs and the new subs.

[00:59.00]And I'm gonna play a different game.
[01:01.16]Not gonna play Sorcery this time.
[01:02.28]Gonna play a different game.
[01:05.56]Uh, you guys can pick what I play.
[01:09.01]We haven't played a game yet.
[01:10.43]You know, that means I haven't been playing a shitty kind of pirate game for like the last hour.
[01:16.03]Don't worry about it.
[01:17.59]We just, we just got here.
[01:19.93]We all just got here.
[01:22.66]thanks that one guy alright let's do another poll I definitely am getting sick by the way I can tell that's not good which game now that the pirate game is not in the list which one are we going to start
[01:58.88]There you go.
[02:03.98]There's your new choices for games.
[02:09.35]Which one are we going to do?
[02:13.13]Which one are these?
[02:14.33]What are we going to do?
[02:17.61]This one's going to be close.
[02:18.53]Now that we've removed sea dogs...
[02:24.45]We have other options here.
[02:34.23]GTA Biker Update.
[02:38.19]Which I have no idea how it works, but I want to try it.
[02:41.30]I want to play it.
[02:44.66]Mafia 3, which just looks outrageous.
[02:47.46]So Mafia 3 or Fallout 4.
[02:51.90]This is extremely close.
[02:55.53]176 to 182 at the moment for GTA.
[03:00.81]Overwatch?
[03:01.31]No, I'm not going to play Overwatch.
[03:04.55]Not now.
[03:06.79]Not now.
[03:11.30]I think this might be still too close to call.
[03:17.30]Fallout 4, it looks like it's going to be GTA Biker Update.
[03:24.05]Just in case it's not.
[03:28.39]Solitaire.
[03:34.77]Yeah, let's play Solitaire.
[03:39.46]I'm going to be closing this out in like another 30 seconds or so.
[03:43.42]20 seconds.
[03:58.12]10 seconds.
[04:00.50]And yes, I eventually am probably going to play Fallout 4.
[04:04.65]Fallout 4 is like a game that's on the list.
[04:07.55]But we just want to know what you guys majority wanted to see first.
[04:12.55]Going to play a lot of different games on this stream.
[04:14.33]Sorcery is going to come back next week.
[04:16.19]But I wanted to change it up.
[04:18.19]At least for this week.
[04:21.52]Alright, 10 seconds.
[04:24.42]And then we're doing GTA.
[04:25.36]Okay.
[04:28.58]Pac-Man goes to high school.
[04:29.55]Yeah, there's going to be random games like that.
[04:34.09]You know, there are going to be random games like Sea Dogs.
[04:44.78]Alright.
[04:45.94]That's it.
[04:47.18]GTA, the biker update, has won the poll.
[04:51.36]Not by very much, but it still did.
[04:54.63]244 to 230 poll is closed thank you for voting it won by only 15 votes but if you didn't vote then yeah what's the old saying if you didn't vote then don't complain play lucius don't you dare talk to see I'm not I'm not I'm not

[05:22.63]That was awesome.
[05:24.66]I actually enjoyed every second of that game.
[05:30.14]Alright.
[05:30.90]For a second, I was just going to open YouTuber's Life.
[05:33.68]Alright.

[07:51.12]Game capture.
[07:52.86]Grand Theft Auto 5.
[07:54.38]Okay.
[07:58.97]There it is.
[07:59.29]I always forget how long it takes to load into GTA Online.
[08:08.35]It takes like six months.
[08:17.78]I need to plug my Xbox controller in.
[08:21.78]Maybe I'll try it with a Steam controller.
[08:23.09]Let's see how this game is with a Steam controller.
[08:25.21]I'm curious.
[08:33.53]Going to make some tea?
[08:34.67]I'll be here when you get back.
[08:38.77]Alright.
[08:42.53]Alright, can't confirm.
[08:44.58]This game with a Steam controller is ass.
[08:49.61]So, we're not going to use it.
[08:54.05]We're not going to use that.
[08:55.53]We're going to put that over here.
[08:59.25]Yeah, we're not going to use that.
[09:00.19]Alright.
[09:04.77]So, how do I do the new stuff?
[09:09.11]Is the wine guy going to become a beer?
[09:10.71]Is that what's going to happen here?
[09:16.86]Drink some wine?
[09:17.82]Oh shit, I forgot to drink some wine.
[09:19.98]Can't start your day without a bowl of wine.
[09:22.10]The numbers on the adversary series represent the maximum number of players for that series?
[09:29.46]Hold on, here it is over here.
[09:31.88]What is this?
[09:36.33]Adversary series.
[09:37.61]Slasher 1.
[09:38.35]Okay.
[09:46.28]I'm pretty sure this is part of the new update.
[09:51.54]Are you not wearing shoes?
[09:52.75]I don't think I am.
[09:53.63]What is this, like a meat factory?
[09:57.67]Two rounds.
[09:58.45]The slasher stocks up to 700 with a shotgun.
[10:03.27]And they've only got flashlights?
[10:04.64]What the fuck is this?
[10:05.66]I thought this was supposed to be like the biker update, not the Michael Myers update.
[10:15.94]Never Trust Purple.
[10:16.70]Thank you, dude, for a thousand bits.
[10:20.36]Thanks for playing that shitty game.
[10:21.50]I haven't laughed that hard in a while.
[10:22.62]Well, at least it was entertaining.
[10:23.80]I hope it was at least funny.
[10:25.99]I thought it was funny.
[10:27.39]But thanks, dude, for the ten bucks.
[10:29.17]And thank you, Falcozor94, for your subscription.
[10:36.43]Classic biker stuff.
[10:39.89]Quit?
[10:40.15]It's an old game mode.
[10:41.59]Oh.
[10:45.39]Happy Halloween.
[10:46.49]See?
[10:46.73]It's Halloween.
[10:49.39]So that's the slasher and we're the ones with flashlights.
[10:55.31]I was about to laugh at this guy's name and I forgot it's mine.
[11:00.72]You gotta make us like the old 40s Frankensteins.
[11:03.36]Come on.
[11:11.14]Alrighty.
[11:11.52]Let's go.
[11:17.08]Thank you, Warnerve.
[11:20.14]94.
[11:20.30]And Lawcat4.
[11:23.26]Streamer playing wrong content.
[11:25.99]I never got to play this, so this is fine.
[11:31.55]We're the default demons.
[11:34.71]Slasher requires one player.
[11:38.79]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[11:40.33]Nice.
[11:42.05]I get to be the slasher.
[11:45.60]So what, I have to go around and shoot people with a shotgun?
[11:48.06]I don't understand this.
[11:56.10]You are the sla- Take out the hunted.
[11:57.64]So I gotta like sneak around?
[12:03.98]Oh, okay.
[12:12.86]So I gotta be sneaky about this.
[12:17.29]I can't.
[12:17.71]Can I run?
[12:18.21]Yeah, I can.
[12:18.63]I don't think I want to run, though.
[12:20.09]I want to crouch.
[12:23.92]Yeah, I want to crouch.
[12:25.72]How come I can't crouch?
[12:27.76]Oh, shit.
[12:28.14]Somebody was just here.
[12:29.94]There's bubbling sand over here.
[12:31.02]Somebody was just over here.
[12:33.26]Somebody's over here cooking sand.
[12:35.99]Found a guy!
[12:39.65]Oh, whoa!
[12:40.55]Whoa!
[12:52.96]kicking me in the spine.
[12:54.30]Oh, that liquid sand.
[13:09.31]Alright, well, let's go play the actual, uh...
[13:22.68]Yeah, Mike Myers got a lot of movies.
[13:25.20]No refunds.
[13:28.56]This time I get to be one of the fucking... Here we go.
[13:31.28]Hide from the slasher.
[13:32.26]Yeah, right.
[13:34.46]Fall blast right into his face.
[13:36.05]I'm going to hit him one time in the fucking mouth and it's going to insta-kill him.
[13:40.35]I'm going to bury this flashlight in his front teeth.
[13:42.45]Yeah, this is where I used to... Remember the liquid sand?
[13:45.79]Remember the liquid sand?
[13:46.67]I came here.
[13:48.67]I know where he is.
[13:51.54]Yep.
[13:51.90]Ooh, somebody's over here.
[13:53.92]I found you because I remember looking at the liquid sand.
[13:57.28]Didn't think that the guy behind you knew you were at the liquid sand part of the map first.
[14:01.91]Yeah.
[14:04.13]Yes.
[14:05.89]You did not know that at first.
[14:08.31]And apparently you don't want to turn around.
[14:09.99]You're just going to run in a circle.
[14:13.88]And until you get... Until you...
[14:20.00]That's just fucking crazy.
[14:54.10]That was fucking perfect.
[15:02.64]I'm gonna pass out.
[15:04.24]I gotta calm down.
[15:06.10]That guy, I didn't even know that guy was here.
[15:08.01]He just came in and fucking barked him on the top of the head and killed him.
[15:18.39]Jeez, man.
[15:21.17]Every fucking time I play, I love this game.
[15:24.50]So much.
[15:25.18]It's so good.
[15:26.14]That shit just doesn't happen in other games.
[15:33.51]Man, I don't even know.
[15:35.15]Sumo?
[15:35.83]I don't know what these are.
[15:40.57]I chased him for so long.
[15:42.19]I hit him so many times in the face with the flashlight and he missed every single time.
[15:48.97]He missed every single time.
[15:53.57]He had like seven opportunities.
[15:55.73]Oh, that was great.
[16:16.14]I'm here for the biker update.
[16:17.24]Yeah, I know.
[16:18.08]Then I got sucked in.
[16:22.02]I got sucked in by adversary mode.
[16:28.52]Thank you, Brandini, for the sub.
[16:29.77]We're doing sumo mode.
[16:43.42]Is that going to go into a highlight?
[16:44.78]You better believe it.
[16:48.35]GTA game, any GTA game is just a living highlight.
[16:56.36]Push the other teams off the Vinewood Motel.
[17:01.10]Are we in the same car?
[17:08.33]Why did I start early?
[17:09.21]Because my internet sucks.
[17:11.59]And I'm getting brand new internet tomorrow.
[17:15.90]Laughing like that made me burp and shit.
[17:19.69]I need a second after that one.
[17:26.39]But I have to start early until... Oh yeah.
[17:35.24]Okay.
[17:40.21]Alright, so it's purple versus orange.
[17:44.21]Yeah, you didn't expect me to fucking do this.
[17:49.18]Oh shit!
[17:50.82]I messed that one up.
[17:51.76]I almost drove off the edge myself.
[17:57.38]I need a better camera angle.
[18:03.91]His car seems like it's way more bouncy than mine.
[18:12.05]Get... off...
[18:20.12]Why do I feel like this is going to be very difficult to do?
[18:26.56]Oh, I was going to take him right down Main Street.
[18:30.84]Who exploded?
[18:31.72]Why did that guy explode?
[18:32.76]I don't... I never drive with my keyboard.
[18:41.61]I always drive with my console controller.
[18:44.79]We win.
[18:45.29]Yay.
[18:48.29]Wiener.
[18:52.98]Let me turn this back up.
[18:56.00]Alright, I'm leaving.
[18:57.58]I'm gonna go do adversary mode.
[19:03.17]Yeah, so before I cut myself off there, my internet at like 8 or 9 p.m.
[19:10.37]every day turns off.
[19:12.75]My upload just goes to shit and I can't stream.
[19:15.91]So it happened so frequently that I had to get new internet.
[19:21.38]So tomorrow I'm getting a whole new line installed here.
[19:26.43]But in the meantime, I can stream during the day for some reason because I don't get bottlenecked during the day.
[19:32.82]Why are we doing this again?
[19:36.20]And hey, just, I'm gonna mind games the fuck out of these guys.
[19:38.68]Ready?
[19:39.02]Watch this.
[19:39.74]See you later, one.
[19:41.36]Watch this guy.
[19:42.30]Yeah, oh, you're gonna get me.
[19:44.38]You're definitely gonna get me.
[19:45.26]You're not gonna get turned around.
[19:46.78]And my partner in crime's not gonna come around and then box you in.
[19:49.96]I'm boxing him.
[19:50.86]Take care of him.
[19:52.58]Boxed.
[19:54.42]We win.
[19:57.74]Hey, thank you, human mail.
[20:00.72]Funded by bits.
[20:06.94]The biker update requires lots of money, does it really?
[20:11.21]We'll figure it out.
[20:18.79]Okay, how do I leave?
[20:19.71]It won't let me get out of here.
[20:26.13]Come on, get me out of this.
[20:26.97]Yeah, that's how you play chess.
[20:35.40]Ah, you're a natural.
[20:38.24]Alright, I'm out of here.
[20:41.86]Let's go do some biker stuff.
[20:48.17]You play forever?
[20:52.63]Are there new melee weapons too?
[20:59.87]Dude, I can't wait to... They had swindle stones?
[21:11.00]Loading screens.
[21:12.72]GTA.com.
[21:14.28]GrandTheftAuto.com.
[21:17.20]Loading screens.
[21:22.92]Oh, we might be stuck in limbo.
[21:25.51]Who knows?
[21:27.05]By the way, me laughing like that just got me sick.
[21:29.63]Like, it escalated my illness by like 40%.
[21:37.07]GTA 5.
[21:37.85]The Swindleswains update.
[21:46.37]What the hell is going on here?
[21:47.46]I just want to ride a motorcycle and curse at people driving by them.
[21:56.48]That's what I want to do.
[22:07.69]Well, we're probably going to get booted back into single player.
[22:11.87]No, no.
[22:12.71]You have to talk shit.
[22:15.17]When you talk shit is when the game listens and it says, okay, sure.
[22:18.21]Alright.
[22:29.74]Get out of the car, you old bitch.
[22:34.38]See you later.
[22:34.88]Alright, so what am I looking for here?
[22:39.78]Let me look at the map.
[22:42.97]Is there anything specific that I can do?
[22:45.11]Or anywhere I should go?
[22:56.20]Adversaries.
[22:57.16]Featured adversary mode?
[23:00.91]Is this what they're talking about?
[23:07.17]Actually, yeah.
[23:11.51]How did you drive full speed into me like that for no reason?
[23:14.39]I thought that was a player.
[23:19.11]How much money do I have?
[23:20.05]I gonna buy the new bike?
[23:20.80]Alright, let's buy the new bike.
[23:29.88]Is it really called the rat bike?
[23:33.30]No, no way.
[23:42.81]Can't you, like, make a crew?
[23:46.37]All these things.
[23:46.97]I want to do all these things.
[23:52.86]Yeah, slipstream is new, I think, right?
[23:56.30]Oh, look at that.
[23:56.76]There it is.
[23:57.32]LD.
[23:59.22]Let's check it out.
[24:03.59]Check it on mobile.
[24:08.77]I'm just trying to get in my cell phone.
[24:11.64]Oh my god, will you get out of here?
[24:13.13]I'd knock your glasses off too.
[24:14.39]I just punched that guy so many times right in the face.
[24:22.63]I have to buy a clubhouse?
[24:26.91]How much money do I have?
[24:27.57]Like 80 grand?
[24:27.89]It's around $200,000 to make a gang?
[24:35.31]Fuck.
[24:35.41]How do I join a gang?
[24:48.61]I just realized I'm reading the chat.
[24:51.93]I'm just driving over the grass.
[25:00.74]So is this the LD thing?
[25:02.54]Missions?
[25:03.18]For the new update?
[25:04.80]Or has this been here for a while?
[25:07.12]Lamar?
[25:08.14]No, Lamar has been here for a long time.
[25:13.33]Go to the shark card market and buy some shark cards.
[25:26.63]Yeah, buy $100,000 and then after spending money on shark cards, go spend it and then make a crew.
[25:37.17]I spent, I dropped like a million dollars.
[25:39.34]Alright, we're gonna do slipstream.
[25:45.54]I'm doing slipstream.
[26:11.98]Fucking idiot.
[26:12.68]Was that a player?
[26:31.71]That guy, you remember like the Muppets movie when like Kermit has the big map in front of his face and he's like, oh, I'm not sure where to go, Fozzie.
[26:40.22]He was just doing that.
[26:40.82]He just had a giant map in front of his face and he doesn't even have his hands on the fucking wheel.
[26:49.90]God.
[26:54.50]I know this is new.
[26:55.46]Slipstream, this, I remember reading about this.
[26:59.64]You get like wrenches and shit.
[27:02.65]I know this is new.
[27:03.51]Like I was on your friends list.
[27:08.41]What the hell?
[27:08.87]I want to play Road Rash.
[27:14.18]Come on.
[27:23.53]Dude, that guy drove full speed directly into my parked car.
[27:31.78]Here we go.
[27:32.42]Yeah, pull them all in here.
[27:37.36]I can't wait to smash somebody with a wrench.
[27:39.38]It's gonna be amazing.
[27:45.09]Can't I, like, invite people?
[27:46.97]Alright, I'm just inviting, like, my whole friends list.
[27:51.01]Whoever's, like, even on it.
[27:55.62]Oh, is this me?
[27:58.04]No, that's not me.
[28:01.16]How did I turn into the host, by the way?
[28:08.30]Let's go.
[28:08.78]Come on.
[28:09.58]Let's do this shit.
[28:15.73]There you go.

[28:29.14]Come on.
[28:30.96]Accept, accept, accept, accept, accept.
[28:40.75]Weather clear.
[28:41.67]Is this all good?
[28:43.25]Team balancing first to win one round?
[28:48.93]Yeah.
[28:52.08]Thanks a lot, Moral.
[28:54.36]I'm not good at driving.
[28:57.78]Well, we need like a full group in here.
[29:01.49]I want at least like 10 players.
[29:09.81]Thank you, MoralFAQ for the subscription.
[29:12.65]And HBrown.
[29:14.28]FezKNizzle.
[29:17.60]Thank you guys for the subs and human mail.
[29:19.12]Thank you as well.
[29:21.20]Welcome back.
[29:21.94]I guess we're just going to go with these 8.
[29:23.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
[29:27.01]Is that enough?
[29:27.67]Who knows.
[29:30.35]We're just going.
[29:32.57]Purple team.
[29:34.58]They have more players than us.
[29:39.74]We have two people now.
[29:40.90]It's 2v4.
[29:44.48]We're vastly outnumbered.
[29:51.42]This is not going to work.
[29:53.27]Well, hopefully...
[29:55.53]All teams must be balanced.
[29:56.79]Purple team needs... Purple team needs zero more players.
[29:59.37]Okay.
[30:00.55]We need zero more players.
[30:02.66]Oh, boy.
[30:03.48]Now they have two people.
[30:04.92]They just screwed themselves so bad.
[30:06.68]Join this team.
[30:07.10]Quick.
[30:08.50]Yes!
[30:09.36]3v3.
[30:13.62]So, I don't... What do you do?
[30:14.76]Do you just bash each other in the brain with a crowbar?
[30:17.28]I think.
[30:21.53]I think.
[30:26.67]Press Z to view... How do you attack?
[30:29.37]No, that's the finger.
[30:38.93]Oh boy, this is fast.
[30:40.77]Weapons enabled.
[30:43.05]Weapons have been enabled.
[30:45.65]Pipe wrench, there it is.
[30:46.73]Give it to me.
[30:48.33]No, no, get off the phone!
[30:54.48]What?
[30:56.76]Oh, it's X. Okay.
[31:02.19]I'm going so fast.
[31:07.79]I just bashed that guy.
[31:11.13]I hit that guy with the force of like 12 people.
[31:14.33]He just hit like seven backflips.
[31:26.04]Oh, hi, sir!
[31:35.25]He thought he was gonna do it to me.
[31:36.83]No.
[31:37.71]Only I do me to me.
[31:40.21]Motherfucker.
[31:44.91]Please tell me this is in the regular game, too.
[31:48.05]I hope you can just buy a wrench and do this to people on the street.
[31:55.05]Hopefully we don't lose the game because of that.
[32:00.74]Make it!
[32:03.24]It was worth it.
[32:04.50]I'm all the way back here.
[32:11.36]Yeah, just take that turn with a little bit of ease.
[32:16.21]It is in the regular game.
[32:17.15]Best update ever.
[32:17.83]Oh, this guy's fucking toast.
[32:30.83]You know what I'm gonna do to you.
[32:39.39]Shit.
[32:43.01]Where did I end up?
[32:43.65]Where the hell am I?
[32:52.61]Dude, if we can get, like, a bunch of people to do this.
[32:54.83]Just in the same server.
[32:56.01]Just... Just do this.
[32:57.55]Like, no rules.
[32:58.25]Just fucking joust.
[33:06.48]I feel like I'm so far away from everything.
[33:08.20]Am I going the wrong way?
[33:11.44]I don't think so.
[33:19.91]You're ahead.
[33:20.35]I guess I'm... Am I ahead of him?
[33:21.69]Apparently.
[33:23.73]I think our team's going to win.
[33:29.57]It's kind of awkward to do this on PC.
[33:30.89]You have to hold X. And, like, left or right mouse.
[33:42.08]These guys are currently going right at me.
[33:47.79]Boy, I almost just took that guy's fucking head clean off.
[33:53.95]Merry Christmas!
[33:58.39]Come on!
[34:03.61]The fucking force field!
[34:05.23]You can't fuck with my force field!
[34:27.70]What a psycho.
[34:34.44]It's like Harry Potter casting a spell.
[34:40.35]Got him.
[34:46.57]This is going on for a long time.
[34:50.90]One would say too long.
[34:53.64]That guy's gonna kill himself.
[34:55.36]Why did you... Hey!
[34:57.61]Get on my bike!
[35:00.49]Oh boy, he's gone.
[35:09.95]I can't wait to do that to somebody just sitting on the sidewalk.
[35:17.35]That's for a day, I'm sure.
[35:18.58]This is never going to end.
[35:21.06]Oh, they're just fighting.
[35:21.68]They're just fighting.
[35:22.18]Perfect.
[35:28.91]Come on.
[35:30.15]Show your face.
[35:32.27]Come here.
[35:33.87]God.
[35:37.17]Oh, damn it.
[35:37.81]I thought I got him.
[35:40.09]Oh, jeez, Red Ranger.
[35:41.09]20 bucks from Red Ranger.
[35:45.51]Thanks a lot, man.
[35:47.71]2,000 bits.
[35:53.73]How are you, dude?
[35:55.17]Rancho P. It is...
[36:01.96]I want someone to just drive straight at me.
[36:04.27]You know, I'm going to go with a different tactic.
[36:06.65]Forget about the wrench.
[36:08.63]What am I talking about?
[36:09.23]What am I saying?
[36:09.87]Forget about the wrench.
[36:10.57]What am I saying?
[36:15.50]Okay, this seriously isn't going to go on forever.
[36:18.32]No one's going to end this.
[36:19.40]Follow the checkpoints?
[36:22.94]You have to go through it at the same time?
[36:24.43]Is that what I'm understanding?
[36:34.87]What?
[36:36.91]Aww.
[36:37.07]I was trying to just ram him.
[36:44.86]Just win the race.
[36:45.66]I don't even know if it's possible to win the race.
[36:50.70]At this point, is it even possible?
[36:59.67]I'm okay.
[37:02.95]Yeah, come and get me down here.
[37:06.81]Yeah, you won't come get me.
[37:09.23]You fucking wusses.
[37:14.93]I don't think I have a team anymore.
[37:16.69]It's just me.
[37:24.41]Big fucking mistake, dude.
[37:31.43]I'm gonna rock this guy.
[37:33.91]Got him.
[37:35.44]I'm the fucking king of the downtown castle.
[37:37.57]Alright, get me out of here.
[37:40.91]Get me out of here.
[37:45.43]How do you get out?
[37:54.15]How do you get out?
[37:58.65]Even while I'm in- We both got each other.
[38:03.68]I was going to say, even when I'm in my phone.
[38:08.94]Purple team, please win.
[38:10.58]Yeah, win.
[38:15.03]No more wrenches.
[38:15.81]Win.
[38:16.27]Just win the game.
[38:17.09]Chase me.
[38:17.71]Come follow me.
[38:18.23]You want to hit me with the wrench?
[38:19.27]Come get me.
[38:20.93]How do you do that?
[38:23.31]Hold on a second.
[38:25.75]Are you fucking serious?
[38:28.47]There's a hatchet too?
[38:42.08]I was so hellbent on killing him.
[38:46.20]I was so... so... Battle Axe?
[39:00.49]This is so dumb.
[39:05.11]Get us out of this map!
[39:13.70]We're both doing the same dumb thing.
[39:21.83]No!
[39:22.21]God damn it!
[39:23.55]Hold down the reset button on the N64!
[39:27.25]Get me out!
[39:30.56]Get me out.
[39:34.08]Job list.
[39:35.42]Escape.
[39:36.84]Just leave.
[39:37.38]Just quit.
[39:38.42]Get out as fast as I can.
[39:42.30]Find new session.
[39:43.84]Go.

[40:04.76]Yeah.
[40:10.96]Hold down the reset button.
[40:12.10]That was my favorite line.
[40:19.64]Check the new bike on mobile.
[40:26.15]I'll see if I can buy the bike.
[40:27.07]If I have enough money.
[40:27.95]I only have like $80,000 or something.
[40:38.06]There were some more one-year subbies.

[44:02.16]Very important.
[44:04.06]I have the Jerma985 mobile.
[44:05.91]It's like the colors of my channel.
[44:08.81]I don't know what this is.
[44:12.89]Yeah, what's... Where the hell is it?
[44:14.11]Oh, there it is.
[44:16.87]What's going on here?
[44:18.41]I drank one glass of wine and it was like I've been abducted by aliens.
[44:29.10]Let's get on this.
[44:31.42]You guys ready?
[44:32.78]You guys ready to barefoot somebody in the face?
[44:41.13]Hey, what's up buddy?
[44:41.91]How you doing?
[44:43.13]Yeah, I'm a biker like you.
[44:44.89]You ever had a barefoot get stuffed right in your fucking face?
[44:49.83]Why can I not?
[44:54.79]What is going on?
[44:59.78]Why couldn't I do that before?
[45:01.26]What the fuck?
[45:07.32]Why couldn't I do that before?
[45:08.72]My bike is gone!
[45:25.81]It's a fucking phone.
[45:26.85]Where's... Oh, damn it.
[45:35.94]I'm gonna call the Mutual Motors Company now.
[45:44.62]Which one is it?
[45:45.80]This one.
[45:49.42]Call insurance.
[45:51.36]Rat bike.
[45:51.62]I can do that.
[45:57.19]No, I didn't mean to kick that lady.
[46:00.69]That's okay.
[46:04.96]Okay, thank you for your mutual deposit.
[46:10.06]I just want... I just want to fucking kick somebody.
[46:14.93]What if you could kick out of the car window?
[46:16.97]Alright, let's go get it.
[46:25.31]Reverse the longest distance without crashing?
[46:27.35]I can do that.
[46:35.04]Let me just sneak into second place real quick.
[46:44.81]I'm going to win.
[46:45.79]I'm going to get to 10,000 feet.
[46:54.64]Does going over the curb count as crashing?
[46:55.98]No, it doesn't.
[47:05.24]You dumbass!
[47:07.29]He just... I didn't crash!
[47:10.37]He crashed into me!
[47:12.39]That shouldn't count!
[47:14.29]He smashed into me!
[47:16.15]That shouldn't fucking count!
[47:26.31]Where's my bike?
[47:28.29]I gotta go pick it up.
[47:35.15]1484.
[47:35.21]I'm at third place.
[47:37.05]Here's my bike.
[47:45.25]I'm gonna get my bike.
[47:46.21]I just want to drill somebody.
[47:47.33]That's all I care about.
[47:49.55]In the biker update.
[47:58.67]Boy, I just hit my fucking head on that guy's car.
[48:03.79]But we're close.
[48:05.37]No, we're not close enough.
[48:06.82]Don't walk there.
[48:15.56]Oh my god, yeah, yeah.
[48:16.60]You can do that.
[48:17.08]Hold on.
[48:17.60]How much time do we have left?
[48:24.07]Okay, right here.
[48:27.61]What is this person doing in this parking lot?
[48:30.97]You're fucking up everything for me because you just don't make any sense.
[48:35.11]He's parking his car.
[48:38.67]Here we go.
[48:44.93]Give me the gold medal.
[48:46.69]Give me the gold medal.
[48:51.58]I'm gonna at least get like second or third place, right?
[48:59.24]It's gonna make me sick.
[49:07.39]Oh, no.
[49:07.77]I can't.
[49:08.03]I gotta stop.
[49:08.51]This is gonna make me sick.
[49:09.75]That seriously is going to make me want to throw.
[49:11.71]I'm gonna throw if I keep doing that.
[49:12.79]I'm not kidding.
[49:16.94]That counts, but I can't do that.
[49:24.78]Sir!
[49:25.32]Sir!
[49:26.42]This is important.
[49:28.68]You gotta watch out.
[49:31.29]You gotta watch out for the foot bandit.
[49:34.75]No, no.
[49:35.27]I want to do the foot bandit joke.
[49:37.95]Sir, you gotta watch out for the foot bandit.
[49:42.21]No, don't throw a grenade.
[49:44.20]I want to... Wait a second.
[49:48.98]Wait, can I just boot this guy?
[49:50.12]Unarmed.
[49:55.52]Unarmed.
[50:02.18]This is not gonna get old.
[50:04.50]I'm gonna have trouble moving on from this one guys.
[50:32.31]Dude, I'm trying to kick you.
[50:35.05]I was trying to kick you.
[50:36.45]I'm sorry.
[50:45.65]It's the barefoot bandit.
[50:47.55]You thought you'd get away from the bare feet bandit?
[50:50.23]You thought wrong.
[50:52.71]Yeah, sometimes the barefoot bandit fucking runs you over accidentally.
[50:56.21]He doesn't mean to, but he does.
[51:03.82]Wait a second.
[51:05.44]Wait a second.
[51:05.96]Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[51:07.24]Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:08.65]No, ease up.
[51:10.41]Ease up, ease up.
[51:11.09]Alright, come get me again.
[51:13.51]No, no, shit.
[51:19.41]Did I mention sometimes a barefoot bandit?
[51:22.47]Same time.
[51:26.79]Get out of the car.
[51:27.93]Get out of the car.
[51:29.95]Yeah, we've got reports.
[51:30.97]We've got reports of some guys kicking people with his dirty bare feet.
[51:34.01]Yeah, we gotta get in there.
[51:35.07]We gotta get the police.
[51:36.32]This guy's a fucking maniac.
[51:38.70]He calls himself the barefoot bandit.
[51:41.22]He's a sick fuck.
[51:43.20]Get back in the car.
[51:44.60]Oh, it's disgusting.
[51:45.38]I don't even want to be near him.
[51:47.10]Who knows where that foot's been?
[51:53.43]Why did they leave?
[52:01.24]What are these guys doing?
[52:03.43]Yeah, we'll play it safe.
[52:06.77]We're gonna play it real safe.
[52:09.91]We're gonna get the fucking military.
[52:17.70]I don't understand why they're doing this.
[52:25.12]Can somebody fucking figure this out?
[52:30.31]He dropped me in the fucking head.
[52:31.87]Oh, God.
[52:42.61]That was unbelievable.
[52:48.00]I love this update so much.
[52:51.06]How do I mute the in-game chat in this game, by the way?
[52:58.76]Because I don't want that shit popping up on the screen ever again.
[53:17.90]Barefoot Bandit.
[53:27.98]Alt F4.
[53:34.06]Thank you, Mickaleef, for your subscription.
[53:37.30]Uncle Levi.
[53:39.52]Human sheeps.
[53:40.12]You guys rock.
[53:48.47]Cover the right part of your screen with your hand.
[53:52.59]Yeah, I gotta fucking get rid of the in-game chat.
[53:59.46]By the way, Mackerel, if you are watching this right now, that part of the stream, go ahead and put a blur on that shit.
[54:12.96]When you evidently, not evidently, eventually, I'm assuming I'm going to probably make a highlight of this.
[54:19.45]So, please, that side of the screen on the right, you know what to do.
[54:24.27]Because I don't want that to pop up in a video.
[54:27.56]Way to kill the vibe, bro!
[54:29.20]Um... How do you get rid of the in-game chat forever?
[54:37.70]All it takes is one guy.
[54:38.72]I know, it's like a weird process to go about doing it, isn't it?
[54:45.48]You have to, like, hold a certain button down and, like, do this and do that and do this.
[54:55.45]Let's put a giant rat on the game chat.
[55:16.26]Let's drink some whiskey.
[55:22.46]Let's smoke some weed.
[55:30.73]Pray to the whale.
[55:32.77]Seems there's no way to turn off the chat.
[55:35.27]There has to be a way to turn off chat.
[55:43.90]Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[55:44.88]The interaction menu.
[55:47.39]I don't know, how do you get to the interaction menu on PC?
[55:58.50]There's a bunch of, like, random people here?
[56:02.90]I wanna, like, figure this out first.
[56:10.98]Answer the door!
[56:19.10]That guy just did like a little hit and run.
[56:26.94]How do you get to the contextual menu on fucking PC?
[56:30.06]I'm gonna have to do it on the Steam controller, because I don't know what it is on PC.
[56:35.77]That guy, you shitting me?
[56:37.79]There.
[56:43.47]Voice chat, no one.
[56:44.49]I don't think you can even do it.
[56:55.52]The barefoot bandit met his match.
[56:59.82]Press M?
[57:04.50]I don't think you can... You can't hide the chat.
[57:06.42]Wow, that's... That's sort of crazy that you can't do that.
[57:13.64]Well... Um... Okey-dokey.
[57:23.54]Let me look at some of the people who did some bits here.
[57:27.24]My age?
[57:27.68]I'm not 30.
[57:28.90]I'm definitely not 30, I can tell you right now.
[57:34.19]Can't see online how to turn off text chat.
[57:35.63]Well... I tried.
[57:42.47]What on Earth?
[57:44.69]That guy just flew around four different places.
[57:47.17]Yeah, get in here.
[57:52.78]Let's all get in that car.
[57:53.54]Let's get in this fucking barf guy's car.
[57:56.42]Let's get in barf jarf's car.
[57:59.16]Come on, let us in.
[58:00.88]Where's my motorcycle?
[58:01.64]Alright.
[58:04.33]Hold on.
[58:04.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[58:05.87]This is so important.
[58:06.69]Can two people kick at the same time on a motorcycle?
[58:17.05]If two people can do it at the same time, we could do double kicks.
[58:22.13]That would be amazing.
[58:25.37]Please get on my motorcycle.
[58:26.41]We have to try this.
[58:33.50]Get on my bike.
[58:34.46]Get on, get on, get on.
[58:36.04]You gotta get on this bike.
[58:37.72]Can you kick on this bike?
[58:41.14]That would be hysterical if you could.
[58:46.99]Probably not.
[58:51.38]Just cover the chat with your s- Oh, you can!
[58:53.44]You can!
[58:54.26]You can!
[58:57.52]Okay, we gotta do some double-kick action here.
[59:01.58]This is unbelievable, I'm so glad you can do this.
[59:04.38]Boot the shit out of this guy's car!
[59:09.17]Yeah, you just got footbanded!
[59:11.75]Footbanded's got a new buddy!
[59:13.65]The shoebanded!
[59:23.68]This person is like freaking the fuck out.
[59:34.29]We need to get some gas.
[59:36.95]Hold on, let's get a little bit of gas.
[59:39.83]No big deal.
[59:42.83]Let's get the gas.
[59:51.02]Come on, we got it, we got it.
[59:52.56]We gotta get the gas, man.
[59:56.78]Hold on, hold on, I'm so bad.
[60:01.79]Let's get this gas with our feet.
[60:03.49]This is gonna be so dumb.
[60:19.46]What have we done wrong?
[60:21.96]What have we done wrong?
[60:24.90]Nothing!
[60:39.29]Fuck you guy!
[60:39.95]You think you're gonna get away?
[60:45.33]You think you're gonna get away from this?
[60:48.30]Oh, you are mistaken.
[60:50.63]Just you wait.

[61:13.29]He's got nowhere to go.
[61:15.29]They both have nowhere to go.
[61:16.27]They're climbing!
[61:18.01]I did not even think they could do that.
[61:19.69]I thought they... Okay.
[61:31.00]No, watch it, watch it.
[61:32.04]Don't kill this guy.
[61:33.30]Don't kill this guy.
[61:36.26]This guy has to stay alive.

[63:25.61]Alright, let's go feed some people.

[71:04.79]We're dead already.
[71:13.94]How far away is it?
[71:15.08]That looked pretty far away on the map when I last looked at it.

[71:52.73]Is that a player?
[71:57.39]I didn't see a thing on his head.
[71:59.43]This is just a guy.
[72:01.97]I have no idea.
[72:08.27]Some guy in like a three-piece suit just got the car.
[72:12.64]First person driving.

[73:41.99]Just another day in Grand Theft Auto.
[73:44.71]No big deal.
[73:46.33]It's just another fucking day.
[73:48.91]Some old lady's just gonna run over.
[73:50.69]There's people just scratching.
[73:54.54]This guy from like the 30s has a machine gun in his hand.
[73:58.62]And then you got the guy in the monster truck just ramming things.
[74:01.04]You know, it's just a regular day.
[74:04.18]No big deal.
[74:08.26]Not a big deal, it's just a regular... Regular day.
[74:13.64]Oh, my fucking god.
[74:16.91]Alright.
[74:17.29]I've had just about a fucking enough of this guy.
[74:24.71]Shoot the guy behind me, he's the one that's causing all the carnage.
[74:28.26]I can go buy the cup.
[74:34.84]I just want to get to the clubhouse.
[74:36.84]That's all I want to do.
[74:37.70]I just want to get to my clubhouse.
[74:42.19]Is this L.A.
[74:42.81]Noire?
[74:44.37]Alright, Jarf.
[74:45.35]You got like a cool card.
[74:47.45]Get us out of here.
[74:49.05]Get us to that clubhouse.
[74:56.13]What?
[74:58.46]This thing screams.
[75:03.12]I love this thing.
[75:03.80]It's a nice little Tron bike.
[75:06.84]Can I kick out of this one?
[75:13.37]No.
[75:15.23]I wish this was a bike.
[75:20.75]This guy's still here.
[75:21.77]He's got such a great car.
[75:25.96]Call a taxi.
[75:31.70]This guy's a good driver.
[75:32.81]This dude just knows what's up.
[75:34.45]It does kind of look like a pod racer, doesn't it?
[75:44.25]Ooh!
[75:45.24]Right into the Coke machine.
[75:46.36]What are the aerodynamics of this thing?
[75:53.82]I've got two front wheels and one back wheel.
[75:56.98]I've got a huge, wide carriage.
[76:01.31]That sounds crazy.
[76:05.64]Easy, easy, easy.
[76:06.56]Yeah, this is my Uber driver.
[76:10.40]My Uber driver is like the Joker.
[76:16.44]In his weird Micro Machines Tron car.
[76:22.77]I'm almost there.
[76:25.21]And then I can lock the door.
[76:29.69]Or can I?
[76:35.03]It's a long ways away.
[76:35.99]It really is so far away.
[76:37.03]You get what you pay for, right?
[76:42.21]I didn't pay very much.
[76:48.77]Shooting flares.
[76:52.09]Wow, dude.
[76:53.55]Okay, that was something else.
[76:55.58]That was something else.
[76:56.52]You just pulled that off.
[76:59.32]Nice work.
[77:03.36]Don't get that flare caught in the blades.
[77:11.90]How do I join your game?
[77:13.18]Just add me... Add Boogerburps and I'm just gonna... When I get inside, I'm gonna add every single fucking person.
[77:19.89]I'm just gonna spam invites.
[77:22.15]We'll all be Piazzed.
[77:28.09]How is this thing still going?
[77:32.63]How expensive is this cart?
[77:34.31]This thing is unbelievable!
[77:43.15]How are we not there yet?
[77:47.10]What a big map.
[77:59.40]I love doing this.
[78:00.26]Just looking at this other side window.
[78:01.97]We just did a full rotation.
[78:05.97]Oh, hey, we're getting a little close to that medium.
[78:09.45]No, we're fine.
[78:10.35]We're going to be alright.
[78:15.32]There we go.
[78:16.18]Hey, thanks for the trip.
[78:20.66]What?
[78:29.07]How does that make any sense?
[78:31.21]I just like rolled... Here I am.
[78:32.09]Nice.
[78:54.88]Yo, you got to invite some prospects, get them to join the club, then you lay down the hierarchy.
[79:00.41]You usually need like a VP, a road captain, a sergeant at arms, definitely an enforcer, you know, something like that.
[79:07.62]How am I going to designate that?
[79:11.18]Bias have one king, and then everybody else is on the same playing field.
[79:27.03]Okay.
[79:27.15]Cool.
[79:27.25]How many people can you fit in the room?
[79:28.73]Jay Buffay for President, Vic for First Noble.
[79:42.60]His head's too big.
[79:43.28]Oh, PC?
[79:43.48]Nice, there's a PC back here.
[79:44.70]He's gonna do none of this.
[79:45.56]Are you taking that out the front door?
[80:14.34]Alright.
[80:15.48]Well, here we are.
[80:16.10]How do I... Oh, that just scared the shit out of me.
[80:27.01]I didn't think I was in here with really anybody.
[80:32.03]Someone's buzzing your clubhouse.
[80:36.37]I'll just buzz him in.
[80:43.11]Hey, what's up?
[80:45.61]Come on in.
[80:47.35]Who else is out here?
[80:55.56]It's this guy.
[80:58.22]Alright, what are we going to do?
[80:59.52]What are we going to do?
[81:02.37]Who wants a drink?

[81:44.81]F12.

[81:50.77]Yeah, there it is.
[81:51.27]Okay.

[82:38.64]Let's play darts.
[82:39.30]No, I don't want to play darts.
[82:42.64]Fuck that.
[82:43.02]I want to arm wrestle somebody.
[82:48.18]I want to try to get like 50 people in here.
[82:51.73]Let's go.
[82:52.31]Who wants to tackle the president of the BS?
[82:54.73]Alright.
[82:59.47]Alright.
[83:02.19]This guy looks like a pretty decent opponent.
[83:05.31]Okay.
[83:06.65]Prepare to see your match.
[83:10.85]Three, two, one.
[83:12.83]I have no idea how to arm wrestle.
[83:15.63]What do you do?
[83:17.37]Okay.
[83:18.63]Okay.
[83:19.43]I don't know.
[83:19.79]80, 80, 80, 80?
[83:21.09]I don't think that's how you do it.
[83:34.78]I don't think I'm doing this right.
[83:42.73]We both don't look like we're doing much effort, by the way.
[83:48.05]Alright, you're out of here.
[83:54.38]You're out.
[83:55.30]You're out of here.
[83:57.24]Don't you know you always like pretend to lose to the fucking leader?
[84:03.19]You fucking lucky.
[84:04.83]Lucky I don't smash a bottle over your head.
[84:12.40]How do we have, like, a bar fight?
[84:15.16]I'm wrestling.
[84:19.48]I can't even do that voice right now.
[84:20.60]I'm, like, getting sick.
[84:23.12]Here we go.
[84:29.16]This guy's having some trouble.
[84:31.96]This guy's having a little bit of a... He's alright.
[84:33.94]He'll be okay.
[84:35.72]Alright, order a drink.
[84:38.64]I'll take one of those.
[84:43.04]This guy's just pointing at me.
[84:48.04]How do you do that?
[84:48.52]How do you just touch people's faces?
[84:51.61]Let's drink a soda.
[84:53.33]You're gonna drink a soda in my bar?
[84:57.25]We drink whiskey.
[84:57.89]Wait a minute.
[85:03.38]Okay, guys.
[85:04.70]Yeah, we're just doing a bunch of drugs and drinking.
[85:09.91]Where did he get that bottle?
[85:11.35]The guy on the right.
[85:15.53]He just has that in his pocket?
[85:24.20]Hey, do they... Do they, like, cut you off at your own bar?
[85:31.10]This guy's, like, changing clothes.
[85:39.12]He's gone.
[85:39.44]That guy's gone.
[85:43.16]Did he die?
[85:43.72]I don't get this.
[85:51.15]How many of these am I going to do?
[85:52.29]Hey, no smoking.
[85:56.25]No smoking.
[85:56.83]This guy's smoking in here.
[85:59.77]Is he smoking?
[86:01.95]What's with his breath?
[86:04.65]He's eating chocolate and smoke is coming out of his mouth.
[86:10.46]That doesn't make any sense.
[86:13.92]Holy shit, I can really... I can really put down liquor, can't I?
[86:20.83]Alright, let's get out of here.
[86:27.19]Let's go take a walk.
[86:32.40]Alright.
[86:33.22]Get out of the way.
[86:35.28]Out of the way, you fucking idiots.
[86:37.70]Oh look, it's Dick Tastedly Richard.
[86:43.66]Alright, who wants to come out here?
[86:45.56]Exit clubhouse.
[86:50.70]So that's, I mean, that's cool.
[86:51.66]That's like a little place for you to hang out.
[86:52.92]But, I mean, how is that necessarily any different than, um, like an apartment?
[86:59.73]If you have an apartment, isn't it the same thing?
[87:01.69]You just have a dartboard now?
[87:05.45]This is what I was talking about.
[87:10.27]A real good beer, bro.
[87:15.93]She wants the all-you-can-eat buffet.
[87:19.79]Name your VP?
[87:20.83]No VPs.
[87:23.39]Vias don't run that way.
[87:24.87]Alright, I want to do another adversary mode.
[87:37.82]Just kidding, I want to climb this.
[87:39.90]I want to get on top of this thing.
[87:43.15]Get me in the back of this, please.
[87:48.68]Alright, pull your car up a little further.
[87:50.04]I can just jump onto the back.
[87:56.48]Oh, fuck.
[87:59.47]Steal the cash from the motorcycle club?
[88:02.63]Wait, another motorcycle?
[88:03.71]Another club?
[88:04.25]We're about to have a gang war right now?
[88:06.91]Let's do it.
[88:10.63]Steal the cash and deliver it to the drop-off to earn... Oh my god!
[88:23.50]Okay.
[88:25.35]Okay.
[88:26.35]Okay.
[88:37.49]Jesus.
[88:41.74]Well, let's keep... Alright.
[88:46.96]There goes that.
[88:49.54]Here's Dick Dastardly Richard again.
[88:54.78]I think it's still there.
[88:59.66]Someone has a jet.
[89:00.76]It's GG.
[89:03.36]Look at this broken down pile of rubble.
[89:08.80]I wish this thing could drive.
[89:11.49]I wish this thing wasn't exploded right now.
[89:13.19]Alright, you guys ready?
[89:18.37]We're gonna have a fucking back of the... No, don't fall.
[89:23.44]I want to have a brawl back here.
[89:27.56]No, no.
[89:28.38]I want to stay in this.
[89:30.74]Stay on top of this.
[89:32.78]Look, I didn't want to have to pull out the fucking sticky bombs, but you know what?
[89:35.44]You gave me no choice.
[89:42.81]That wasn't even the right guy.
[89:46.81]That was like the fire department.
[89:52.05]Alright, you guys, we gotta have a king of the hill brawl up here.
[89:55.81]Guns away.
[89:56.79]Put your guns down.
[89:57.93]We're having an old-fashioned backyard brawl.
[90:02.47]Yeah, brawl.
[90:03.41]In the tar pits.
[90:05.40]So that means put down the minigun.
[90:08.32]No minigun.
[90:11.26]If you get knocked out, you lose.
[90:12.70]If you get knocked out of the fucking ring, you lose.
[90:18.73]Everybody has to be fist only.
[90:20.25]No weapons.
[90:21.43]No bullshit.
[90:22.85]Only punches.
[90:23.51]If you fall out, you lose.
[90:25.35]You guys ready?
[90:26.57]You guys ready to start the fucking backyard brawl?
[90:30.07]First punch.
[90:31.19]First punch gets ten points.
[90:33.25]First punch gets ten points.
[90:37.84]Somebody got ten points.
[90:39.80]The fucking backyard brawl.
[90:50.11]Come on.
[90:51.02]Come on.
[90:52.42]Oh, shit.
[91:02.76]Oh.
[91:03.66]I just heard an explosion.
[91:06.79]Oh, they're all gone.
[91:07.97]Something exploded.
[91:13.05]Alright, round two.
[91:16.17]Round two.
[91:19.05]Get up there.
[91:22.49]This time, everybody has to have a weapon.
[91:24.43]Can we even get back up on here?
[91:29.87]I don't know.
[91:30.35]Jesus.
[91:34.75]And there's like thunder and lightning.
[91:36.13]Please, somebody get struck by lightning.
[91:39.70]Alright, everybody has to have the same weapon.
[91:44.50]I can't even say that word.
[91:46.84]Alright, what do I want here?
[91:49.74]Everybody has to have a hammer.
[91:52.85]How many guys have a hammer?
[91:55.85]It's only hammers.
[91:58.51]Jesus!
[92:04.97]No, hammers only.
[92:06.56]Hammers only.
[92:08.00]No grenades.
[92:09.58]Only hammers.
[92:12.44]Or other similar blunt objects.
[92:14.74]No baseball bats.
[92:16.10]You have to have a bat.
[92:18.26]We gotta get in the Brawl Bia Arena.
[92:23.89]Who's this random guy spraying?
[92:26.64]No!
[92:27.18]This is the Bia Brawl Arena!
[92:30.14]There's no water cannons allowed in the Bia Brawl Arena.
[92:34.52]And now I need to eat like food.
[92:36.16]I just die.
[92:38.13]I got sprayed to death with water.
[92:43.03]Somebody sprayed me with water and it killed me.
[92:46.77]Put your shoes back on.
[92:47.69]No way.
[92:48.27]Never.
[92:50.03]Bia.
[92:56.72]Alright, everybody in the beer arena.
[92:59.85]No more dog shit.
[93:06.59]How is that thing pulling back?
[93:08.37]This person's still just sitting there, wedged in.
[93:11.71]Alright, baseball bats only.
[93:13.13]Yep.
[93:13.97]Oh my fucking god.
[93:16.33]Now I'm getting crushed.
[93:18.19]And I have like 30% HP.
[93:20.77]Oh great, now I'm seriously wedged.
[93:25.70]Oh.

[93:31.29]Please.
[93:32.31]Please.
[93:32.91]Let me get.
[93:36.19]You fucking idiots.
[93:38.33]Okay.
[93:39.21]Okay.
[93:39.68]Guy in this car.
[93:41.50]You need to calm the fuck down.
[93:42.82]The guy doesn't even have a shirt on.
[93:44.44]This dude is naked.
[93:51.33]He's got so many cars wedged.
[93:54.37]What is going on with this guy in this car?
[94:05.01]What a fucking mess.
[94:08.41]Jeez.
[94:09.47]Thank you Nasty Banquot for the subscription.
[94:11.98]Bum Oven.
[94:14.30]I'm Juan Drew.
[94:14.88]Thank you Javelin for the bits.
[94:15.80]Thank you Yellow Helicopter for the bits.
[94:20.05]Couple times.
[94:20.97]Go milk tea.
[94:21.65]Thanks for the bits again.
[94:23.73]I don't think we're ever going to be able to... This guy's on fire.
[94:30.44]Just... Please.
[94:32.98]Alright, alright, alright.
[94:34.30]In the arena.
[94:36.64]You know, I'm actually shocked we got that even the first time.
[94:39.84]And nobody just instantly dropped like a grenade on the ground.
[94:43.18]Baseball bats only.
[94:45.34]Baseball bats only.
[94:46.25]No fucking around.
[94:47.01]Get up here.
[94:47.49]Baseball bats only.
[94:50.56]No stabbing.
[94:54.00]Blunt objects.
[94:57.21]Alright, you guys ready for the Brawl Arena part two?
[95:00.27]Blunt objects only.
[95:03.37]Alright.
[95:04.83]On the count of three... We're gonna start.
[95:08.05]Are you ready?
[95:10.23]Three... Two...
[95:12.14]What?!
[95:16.42]Smash him!
[95:16.80]Smash him in his fucking skull!
[95:27.10]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[95:29.10]No, come on!
[95:33.12]No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:36.16]Who are we hitting?
[95:38.44]Why are we not hitting each other?
[95:43.97]Are you serious?
[95:52.63]God damn it.
[96:01.79]This is such a train wreck.
[96:07.38]I love how the pedestrians just keep driving.
[96:12.32]They just drive full speed.
[96:15.40]Every time.
[96:16.74]Then they don't stop.
[96:17.50]Let me tell you something, man.
[96:19.52]I'm not sure you understand this.
[96:21.45]But backing up and driving full speed again into eight cars is not going to make the problem go away.
[96:29.30]I know that everybody has, like, tunnel vision.
[96:32.60]And they drive straight.
[96:34.39]But look, look at this guy!
[96:36.21]That's not gonna fix the problem!
[96:38.59]Wait, that person's actually leaving.
[96:47.74]There's so many cars.
[96:54.74]This is turning into a junkyard.
[96:58.86]The clown cockatastrophe, thanks, uh, Fibonacci.
[97:03.02]That's not right.
[97:08.20]I just drove off a cliff.
[97:12.38]Uh, alright.
[97:14.22]In the back of this pickup truck.
[97:17.02]Everybody get in the back of the pickup truck.
[97:21.04]Stand still in the back of the pickup truck.
[97:24.88]And melee only.
[97:25.94]No, get the gasoline can out of here.
[97:28.62]Get in the back.
[97:29.84]Back of the pickup truck.
[97:32.02]And we're going to start another backyard brawl.
[97:34.50]No.
[97:39.46]The B.A.
[97:40.18]Junkyard Arena.
[97:44.18]Dude, that guy just killed like nine people.
[97:46.20]Alright, I'm getting in.
[97:51.10]Get me out of this mess.
[97:53.66]Take me away from this nonsense.
[97:59.04]Oh, that was fun.
[98:02.76]Look at all this shit.
[98:03.58]Alright, I'm gonna be the beast.
[98:08.59]I don't know what that means.
[98:16.57]Come on, let's do the beast.
[98:18.85]Beast mode.
[98:29.42]Just look at this picture.
[98:30.34]That guy just got... That guy just fucking ran him over.
[98:39.71]I thought one of the firemen had a gun.
[98:41.71]I thought one of the firemen had a gun.
[98:56.30]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[99:01.72]The firefighter gets run over and pulls out a gun.
[99:05.25]Wait, what?
[99:06.15]Okay, that's wicked funny.
[99:10.53]I'm actually crying.
[99:14.09]The fucking firefighter had a gun, but... Man, I don't know why that's getting me so much.
[99:27.21]Why is that the thing that's getting me?
[99:30.45]Ugh.
[99:32.32]I just picture, like, a bunch of carnage.
[99:35.86]Man.
[99:39.42]That was really funny.
[99:46.89]You called for a firefighter, right?
[99:53.89]Oh, I can take a breather now.
[99:55.07]You got me away from that fucking nonsense.
[99:59.43]Thank you.
[100:03.96]I can still hear the fire.
[100:09.51]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[100:11.67]I thought that was the fire.
[100:12.93]I didn't think there was actually people here.
[100:15.33]Alright, get us in here.
[100:16.31]Let's go put on some fires.
[100:20.21]What?
[100:21.07]Why?
[100:22.27]What happened?
[100:23.99]No, fuck!
[100:29.13]Easy, easy.
[100:29.63]Don't back up too far.
[100:37.20]Alright, let's get- let's do this.
[100:39.76]Dude, I can't- I couldn't- Dude, imagine like a jet just flew into the middle of that.
[100:44.38]I would've fucking thrown up.
[100:48.56]Yeah, this is the BF fire crew.
[100:50.90]Jet!
[100:51.56]Jet!
[100:52.42]Jet!
[100:53.64]Jet!
[100:55.50]Jet!
[100:57.68]Get up!
[100:59.42]No, no, no!
[100:59.80]Let me- let me on the jet!
[101:01.84]NO!
[101:03.24]What have you done?!
[101:03.86]No, what have you done?! !
[101:07.87]Oh, what have you done?
[101:08.77]Oh, what have you done?
[101:14.73]What have you done?
[101:30.82]Is it the beast?
[101:35.91]Oh, somebody take out the beast.
[101:43.64]Okay.
[101:44.92]Easy.
[101:46.96]Come on, beast.
[101:48.16]Yeah, you thought you were gonna... Oh!
[101:50.20]Hello, gentlemen!
[101:52.42]Saving this one for the beast!
[101:54.95]Fuck.
[101:58.73]So how can you tell... You can see his blip sometimes.
[102:03.05]He was down here.
[102:06.09]No, I'm standing still, guys.
[102:07.59]Come on.
[102:10.63]You got me.
[102:12.49]Got him.
[102:19.03]I want a plane.
[102:20.79]Oh my god.
[102:26.93]Easy.
[102:27.51]Easy now.
[102:28.59]Easy now.
[102:31.87]Easy now.
[102:32.29]Let's go.
[102:35.13]Get us out of here!
[102:38.14]Am I driving the plane?
[102:40.06]No, I'm not.
[102:42.16]You gotta get us out.
[102:43.64]Get us out.
[102:44.64]Clip that guy's fucking head off.
[102:48.31]Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up.
[102:51.73]Pull up.
[102:53.39]Oh yes, get us out of here.
[102:56.77]Look at this, look at this hero.
[102:59.43]Here we go.
[103:00.46]Dude!
[103:02.58]What?
[103:05.02]What was that?
[103:07.50]Come, we were in the air.
[103:09.00]You could have played the ending of the fucking movie music.
[103:11.92]And now we're getting shot down by a machine gun.
[103:14.59]With your, like, it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world shit plane.
[103:19.57]We're locked down.
[103:20.01]Where are you taking us?
[103:22.95]We're dead.
[103:23.93]That's all.
[103:31.99]What a bunch of Benedict Donalds.
[103:35.67]Where do these people get these random fucking planes?
[103:39.36]Can I get in this one?
[103:40.14]I don't think I can... I guess I can.
[103:46.56]I guess I'm in.
[103:52.36]Who's driving?
[103:56.39]It's just chaos, dude.
[104:03.87]This isn't World War I getting a jet.
[104:08.39]Oh, I didn't even see Etalyx resubscribe.
[104:10.07]Hey, Etalyx.
[104:13.31]Wow, that guy.
[104:14.09]I thought that was on top of the plane.
[104:15.19]Alright, take us out.
[104:18.10]Get us into safe airspace.
[104:22.61]Alright, I wonder if these guys are just going to drive into the ground.
[104:26.57]Look at this dude.
[104:28.36]Like, really, man?
[104:30.88]Really, dude?
[104:32.24]For real?
[104:33.20]For real?
[104:33.56]We got in the air?
[104:34.24]Okay, guys, we got in the air.
[104:35.88]And we instantly explode.
[104:42.33]Thank you, Etalyx.
[104:43.13]Thank you.
[104:43.61]Hi, Hokie.
[104:44.49]For eight months, dude.
[104:45.21]And welcome, Krakensbane.
[104:48.57]There's still a fucking beast.
[104:50.55]What's going on, hen?
[104:54.23]Thanks a lot for the sub, Hen632.
[104:58.23]We almost did it.
[104:58.91]We almost got out of the airspace.
[105:02.73]Yeah, you tried.
[105:03.80]You tried.
[105:04.14]At least you tried.
[105:10.04]Okay.
[105:13.18]Let's go.
[105:15.82]You know what time it is.
[105:16.52]We'll bring in the original.
[105:20.17]The original gangster.
[105:22.13]The foot bandit.
[105:28.48]Looks like I'm about to, like, squat and take a shit over the side of the bike.
[105:31.91]Yeah, yeah, just pull up real close.
[105:33.13]I'll just stop shit on this guy.
[105:34.37]I'll just, like, diarrhea on this dude.
[105:44.09]What is it like?
[105:44.47]Can you do it in third person?
[105:46.11]Or first person?
[105:49.54]No, you can't in first person.
[105:53.44]Aw, that's too bad.
[106:01.37]I didn't get him.
[106:02.67]This is what I wanted.
[106:03.49]This is what I wanted.
[106:10.83]Come on.
[106:11.27]That was close.
[106:21.91]I'm never gonna be able to hit one of these guys.
[106:24.13]Not a chance.
[106:30.80]This is so dumb.
[106:32.90]Ooh!
[106:34.43]Almost got him.
[106:34.89]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[107:05.61]I just opened up Windows Media Player.
[107:17.20]God, we gotta do something.
[107:20.62]I can't do this anymore.
[107:22.36]As fun as this is, I have fun doing this every time.
[107:24.50]A random guy on a farm tractor comes by and tills the sand underneath us.
[107:29.97]And rams a guy.
[107:37.42]Ooh, that's a little jet.
[107:38.22]Little jet.
[107:40.06]It's mine.
[107:42.06]Mine.
[107:43.74]Come on.
[107:44.08]Come on, farmer, bro.
[107:46.06]Keep him off me.
[107:47.54]Keep these guys off me, farmer.
[107:48.74]I can't even stand up.
[107:51.44]I can't even fucking stand up.
[107:53.35]I fall every time.
[107:57.23]Let me in.
[107:58.99]Let me in.
[107:59.31]I was gonna get hit by the blades.
[108:09.83]Dammit, Farmer Bro is really taking care of me too.
[108:17.25]He had my back.
[108:17.97]That was unfortunate.
[108:20.11]Alright, we gotta bring out the big guns here.
[108:27.82]I think it's time to bring out the hatchet.
[108:33.70]We're gonna lop somebody's head off.
[108:45.17]It was me.
[108:46.27]It was me.
[108:46.73]I got my head lopped off.
[108:47.79]Alright, just slowly drive us by somebody.
[108:53.40]What the fuck?
[108:56.68]Who even kills me?
[109:03.42]How did I even die there?
[109:04.36]I got like...
[109:06.88]I'm getting sniped.
[109:08.80]A dude has like a super ultra like times 35,000 scope.
[109:11.84]And he's gonna kill me over and over again.
[109:14.58]Guaranteed.
[109:16.38]I need my farmer, bro.
[109:20.12]Hold on a second.
[109:21.32]Is that a person actually in a plane?
[109:27.67]Dude, there's a dude driving a huge jet.
[109:32.01]What?
[109:34.27]Oh, you gotta land that over here.
[109:36.74]Land that over here.
[109:40.29]Oh, that's Haleed.
[109:41.79]That's megalomaniacal Haleed.
[109:43.15]Dude, you gotta turn that thing upside down and bring it over here.
[109:52.97]That's crazy.
[109:53.74]That thing is enormous.
[109:56.14]Why is he phased out?
[109:58.36]That's weird.
[109:58.84]He's not like he's a ghost.
[110:02.34]Okay, follow the plane.
[110:03.38]Follow the jumbo plane.
[110:05.38]We gotta get in that.
[110:12.80]Watch out for the sniper.
[110:14.46]He likes to shoot you in the head.
[110:18.55]Let's get to that.
[110:19.27]Let's get to the... Hey, you're looking for me to kick.
[110:22.65]No, we don't got time for kicks right now, dude.
[110:24.23]We gotta get to the jumbo jet.
[110:26.09]Just kidding.
[110:26.43]There's always time for kicks.
[110:32.26]How did we miss that?
[110:37.74]Where's that jet?
[110:38.90]All the way down there?
[110:41.66]Alright, it's time to defend the jet and get in it.
[110:43.82]Alright, slow it down.
[110:45.88]Slow it down.
[110:46.24]Slow it down here.
[110:46.78]Slow it down here.
[110:47.28]Slow it down.
[110:51.55]Oh, he's got passive mode on.
[110:52.71]Okay.
[110:53.01]Alright, we're in.
[110:59.51]We're actually in the giant jet.
[111:02.09]Can it take off?
[111:03.83]That is the question of the evening.
[111:07.03]Where are we going to get just rammed by Farmer Joe?
[111:14.12]I actually think we're going to take off.
[111:18.19]In case you guys are wondering, the beast is dead.
[111:21.29]It gives a shit.
[111:22.63]We're in like the jumbo jet now.
[111:28.12]What?
[111:29.58]We're just like chilling back here?
[111:32.42]See, I can't even tell what's going on.
[111:33.84]You could just crash right now and I would never know.
[111:44.47]We're just upside down.
[111:46.23]Oh, God.
[111:46.97]Hold on a second.
[111:53.45]So, yeah.
[111:53.88]Have you guys seen that new movie, Finding Nemo 2?
[111:56.98]I heard it's a pretty good one.
[112:01.62]It stars two fish.
[112:04.52]They're looking for each other.
[112:07.10]There's a shark in that movie, too.
[112:09.97]Yeah.
[112:11.01]It's pretty good.
[112:13.41]I think it's one of my favorite movies.
[112:15.05]Next to Ghostbusters 2.
[112:17.28]The Search for Vigo.
[112:22.10]Does anybody have any crackers?
[112:24.36]I would love a cracker right now.
[112:25.88]Two crackers.
[112:26.70]Because I'm greedy.
[112:30.50]You know what would just be awful?
[112:31.78]If the screen just exploded.
[112:40.56]He hit a tree.
[112:44.92]We're alive.
[112:46.80]We are... Okay.
[112:49.96]What?
[112:53.18]How did I get over here?
[112:59.62]I'm surprised we're alive.
[113:02.94]Okay.
[113:03.04]Okay.
[113:06.61]There's that.
[113:08.77]Missed cue.
[113:13.33]How do we live?
[113:15.62]This is a new episode of Lost.
[113:18.82]Hey!
[113:21.74]That wasn't very nice.
[113:31.23]I'm on fire!
[113:33.68]Where the hell did we end up?
[113:34.46]We're so out of... We're just nowhere.
[113:36.46]What is going on?
[113:41.80]This guy can't... He can't get up the... Oh, I love GTA.
[113:48.20]It's the best game ever.
[113:57.93]Okay, let's go hatchet.
[113:59.63]Alright, let's do like an adversary mission or something.
[114:04.54]Oh, fuck.
[114:05.08]I just clipped that guy.
[114:09.31]Take us up the mountain.
[114:11.01]Get us to the top of that mountain.
[114:12.95]Let's get up there.
[114:13.51]We need a better look.
[114:14.19]We need a better view.
[114:18.76]Thank you.
[114:19.88]Pone do nice.
[114:20.92]Pone do nice for eight months.
[114:23.62]It says nice one.
[114:25.96]Thanks a lot, Hens632.
[114:26.58]Krakensbane.
[114:28.82]Hihohee, I think I already got these guys.
[114:31.00]I'm sure I didn't miss anybody.
[114:31.91]I probably did.
[114:32.63]If I did, I'm sorry.
[114:34.37]I was just too into the fucking mess that was the last thing we were doing.
[114:42.01]Oh, let's go on top of the map.
[114:42.65]I don't know.
[114:47.97]You guys want to watch, like, puke mode?
[114:49.25]Because that's what that is.
[114:49.93]Go to the abandoned mineshaft?
[115:04.49]It's not just good, it's the best.
[115:08.37]And that's where we fall.
[115:10.48]That's the end of our trip.
[115:15.06]We're going to have... Guys, get to the top of this mountain.
[115:18.48]We're going to have one more beer brawl.
[115:20.87]We're doing it on the edge of a cliff.
[115:24.09]It's going on 98 Eclipse.
[115:25.95]Thank you for subscribing, dude.
[115:29.15]You hear that?
[115:29.59]All those guys that are in this lobby right now, get to the top of this cliff.
[115:32.97]We're going to the very top.
[115:33.91]We're going to get right in the edge, and we're going to have the brawl, the Biaf push brawl.
[115:39.81]Good luck to you.
[115:50.06]If we don't fall off first, that is.
[115:52.72]Yeah, we got a crew following us.
[115:54.32]We should get up there.
[115:54.88]Okay.
[116:03.71]Gotta get right to the edge.
[116:09.53]CLP 013, thanks for the bits, dude.
[116:15.99]I forgot how long it takes to get up here.
[116:19.67]It's like a thousand degrees in my room right now.
[116:21.63]Holy shit.
[116:27.08]Did Etalyx just get a full moon?
[116:29.10]He just did.
[116:31.41]A full Jupiter.
[116:33.07]No, moon.
[116:33.71]Oh yeah, Jupiter.
[116:34.25]What am I talking about?
[116:37.53]Alright.
[116:38.89]We've made it.
[116:39.77]What if he just ran my head over?
[116:41.11]That would have been so bad.
[116:47.59]All Bias need to get here.
[116:49.31]We need to get to the right here.
[116:52.87]Oh shit!
[116:55.66]That was not intentional!
[117:02.18]please tell me I'm up here still fuck my god my forward momentum fucked me so hard no no no no no no no I can't even get up there can I
[117:28.98]God damn it.
[117:30.20]Please tell me I can get on the back of your bike.
[117:36.22]Thank God.
[117:39.20]I was going too fast and I fucking got on the edge.
[117:44.71]No rewinds.
[117:49.19]Thank you for saving me.
[117:54.85]Guys, we're getting on the roof.
[117:57.25]New plan.
[117:59.53]This roof over here.
[118:00.57]Everybody on top of this roof.
[118:01.83]Be careful.
[118:02.67]It's treacherous.
[118:03.67]You don't want to fall.
[118:05.59]This guy has got a death wish.
[118:08.54]Is he going to do it?
[118:09.84]Oh, nice job.
[118:10.92]You've got to be careful.
[118:14.94]Easy.
[118:15.46]Easy.
[118:15.88]You can easily push somebody off here.
[118:17.30]He's going to try to push me off.
[118:18.02]Go.
[118:19.46]I knew he was going to try to push me off.
[118:22.44]Oh, shit.
[118:22.82]That guy didn't make it.
[118:26.42]We've got to get to the edge.
[118:27.30]This is the...
[118:29.96]This is the final biab roll, and it's over here.
[118:32.24]I have to do it over here, on the edge.
[118:36.91]This way.
[118:37.87]Oh, come on!
[118:41.47]Honest to God.
[118:43.15]Some guy, like, just proned in a bush somewhere and is sniping.
[118:46.13]Where is he?
[118:49.85]Where's the sniper?
[118:51.07]Come on, you gotta do the final biab roll.
[119:00.50]I love how it's a backyard yabrawl.
[119:03.81]And we're not in a backyard.
[119:05.87]We're on a roof on a fucking mountain.
[119:12.95]Holy shit, I almost just fell.
[119:14.85]I fell.
[119:20.04]Give me all your bike.
[119:21.64]This guy with the fucking sniper rifle.
[119:27.88]I'm gonna go find where that guy's lying and just drop a grenade in the grass.
[119:35.07]Get us over there.
[119:37.59]Be careful.
[119:38.79]It's tricky.
[119:39.33]He's gonna fall.
[119:40.43]He ain't making that.
[119:43.55]Okay, yeah, he is.
[119:45.81]What is my guy doing?
[119:48.95]This is becoming far more difficult than it should be.
[119:55.74]Okay, thanks.
[119:56.40]Thanks for the ride, man.
[120:00.52]Alright, we got this?
[120:02.60]These final guys here?
[120:03.52]Alright, let's do it.
[120:06.41]We gotta get on the edge.
[120:08.27]Over here.
[120:11.85]You can only be eliminated by getting pushed.
[120:13.71]No punches, you have to get pushed off.
[120:16.49]Oh, hey guys, here's a helicopter.
[120:20.93]Thank god they didn't just unload a machine gun over here, because that's what I thought was going to happen.
[120:27.74]They took the smart road.
[120:33.18]So no weapons, only pushes.
[120:37.46]Try not to punch.
[120:38.54]You have to shove.
[120:41.58]Last man to not get shoved off the edge wins.
[120:47.26]Alright guys.
[120:49.14]You have to stay on this side.
[120:50.48]No going over here.
[120:51.75]This is an automatic disqualification.
[120:53.39]You go on this side.
[120:55.13]Stay on the right side.
[120:57.65]No going over that.
[120:59.33]We didn't start yet.
[121:00.15]Excuse me.
[121:00.85]Wait, what?
[121:03.24]Thanks, female Jesus.
[121:04.10]Thank you, shifty block.
[121:07.46]Thank you, CLPO.
[121:08.76]Live 100 bits.
[121:11.14]And 98 eclipse.
[121:12.18]Make sure I think I got him.
[121:13.72]Well, welcome.
[121:15.20]Alright, pushes only.
[121:16.74]Don't get lit on fire by that fire bomb.
[121:20.45]And three.
[121:21.99]Get off that bike.
[121:23.27]Get off that bike or I'm pushing you.
[121:25.53]Get off that bike right now.
[121:30.37]Get off that bike.
[121:32.50]Put that gun away.
[121:34.34]Nope.
[121:34.90]Put that gun down.
[121:39.55]I gave you a warning.
[121:41.37]I told you.
[121:43.69]Get off that damn bike.
[121:44.47]Alright, let's do it.
[121:48.97]Go, go.
[121:49.67]Shoves only.
[121:50.45]Pushes only.
[121:52.53]Didn't work.
[121:53.71]I'm just like punching.
[121:55.19]I'm going to die.
[122:11.71]That guy just did like an Olympics.
[122:15.34]You're on like the floor routine.
[122:18.14]Floor routine off the edge.
[122:25.16]Why did that happen?
[122:26.88]He did like a triple X. Oh.
[122:38.10]Alright, again, again, one more time.
[122:40.42]One more time.
[122:42.70]Oh my god.
[122:48.56]I wanna see that again.
[122:49.65]Oh, come on, let's... What are you doing?
[122:59.81]What are you doing?
[123:03.15]Okay, I wanna just watch this next one.
[123:08.15]Alright, get us up there.
[123:10.46]Everybody get up there again.
[123:13.80]I'm just going to watch this time.
[123:16.22]Because that was too funny.
[123:19.52]Yeah, that guy was a high dive.
[123:20.84]I don't know.
[123:24.62]I don't know what's happening to this guy.
[123:26.30]What is this guy?
[123:26.99]What happened to you?
[123:28.59]What happened to you?
[123:30.85]That's like electrified.
[123:37.64]This has got like 10,000 volts going through it.
[123:43.58]Alright, let's get up here so we can do this one more time.
[123:45.84]I love how it's like the morning.
[123:52.65]The sun is coming up.
[123:58.83]Alright, let's get up there.
[124:00.43]No more fucking around.
[124:01.35]Get up there.
[124:01.69]We're gonna do this one more time.
[124:05.15]Shoves only.
[124:10.94]Shoves only.
[124:13.82]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[124:15.72]No.
[124:16.94]Honestly, he's doing like fireworks.
[124:21.05]That's kind of cool.
[124:24.87]Whoops, I apparently didn't have any left.
[124:27.03]Okay.
[124:27.99]I'm just going to watch this one.
[124:29.19]Stay on this side.
[124:30.13]Okay, here's the rule.
[124:33.59]Melee only.
[124:34.21]If you come after me, I'm loading you full of bullets.
[124:39.25]No guns.
[124:41.54]Melee only.
[124:45.41]What the fuck?
[124:49.87]You are going for a huge finish here.
[124:53.61]Alright, left side only.
[124:55.31]You can try to only shoves.
[125:00.21]And it's going to start here in three seconds.
[125:02.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:03.84]One more guy's here.
[125:06.06]Wait for this guy to get up here.
[125:08.32]And by the way, the rule is, only melee with you guys.
[125:10.76]Whoever wins, wins.
[125:11.68]And if you come after me, I'm shooting the shit out of you.
[125:14.62]If you come within... I'm standing over here.
[125:15.90]If you come within five feet of me, I'm unloading this whole clip into your body.
[125:20.97]So get as far to the left over here as you can.
[125:25.95]This is... Everyone's just lagging.
[125:29.32]What is happening?
[125:32.76]This... Something's not right about this.
[125:35.87]Alright, melee only, pushes only.
[125:38.13]Go.
[125:40.57]See ya.
[125:42.05]Three, two, one, go.
[125:43.80]Pushes only.
[125:44.42]You gotta push him off this left side.
[125:47.84]Go for it.
[125:52.93]No, don't punch the bike.
[125:54.33]Okay, you're gone.
[126:06.57]What the fuck is going on?
[126:08.91]This is... What the fuck?
[126:15.06]What?
[126:15.40]I... I don't even know what the hell that was.
[126:27.24]But apparently I got like loaded with bullets somehow.
[126:34.04]This is all going to shit at this point.
[126:43.38]Well, okay.
[126:45.76]Is my internet fucked up?
[126:46.86]Did we hit the time when I can't stream?
[126:54.45]We might be getting to that point.
[126:55.67]I might have to end the stream here soon.
[127:02.41]Alright.
[127:03.44]Like five more minutes of nonsense.
[127:09.30]And then, yeah, I'm gonna end the stream in here in a few minutes, because this is starting to really die here.
[127:14.75]I love how there's just a helicopter just sitting here.
[127:23.52]Alright, everybody get on the edge of the building.
[127:26.02]This thing is just falling down.
[127:33.20]Alright, first person, here's what we're gonna do.
[127:35.24]I'm gonna hover over here, and you guys are just gonna jump off into the blades.
[127:42.33]I can't fucking believe I just hit F. I'm done.
[127:54.59]Stream's over.
[127:57.21]I was fucking trying to press D and I pressed F. And I fell out.
[128:02.11]Let's game over.
[128:07.45]That's it.
[128:11.69]Have I dropped any frames?
[128:13.29]I don't think so.
[128:21.53]I fat-fingered DNF.
[128:26.37]Wait, somebody's got a grenade.
[128:27.23]Yo, you think you're gonna get me?
[128:29.23]Nope!
[128:31.67]You thought you were gonna get me, didn't you?
[128:33.33]That guy who went flying.
[128:35.83]I gotta jump into the blades and then end the stream.
[128:38.58]Come on!
[128:39.90]No!
[128:44.48]Stream is fine, it's GTA.
[128:47.26]It's GTA, not you.
[128:48.46]Okay.
[128:53.76]Well, I'm gonna jump in a new session, then.
[128:57.40]I wanna do adversary mode one more time.
[128:59.30]One of the ones I haven't done.
[129:01.55]So, new sesh.
[129:04.85]I wanna do adversary mode, and then I'm gonna end the stream.
[129:07.97]So, I'm at, like, 20-30 minutes.
[129:16.33]I did not finish Sorcery.
[129:17.29]Sorcery's coming back next week.
[129:25.07]I just wanted to, um... Do something a little different.
[129:30.80]I'm having a ton of fun with Sorcery, but... You know, obviously you want to... Change it up a little bit.
[129:34.72]We played the dumbest, shittiest game earlier.
[129:37.06]Well, shitty in the sense that it was just very complicated and... Buggy and outdated.
[129:45.43]I just woke up after a good day of destroying a whole city.
[129:54.31]I have a Tinder date at 7.
[129:56.43]That's not true.
[129:59.08]Play Seadogs again?
[130:00.20]Maybe another time.
[130:02.74]I'll get into it and try to figure out what's actually going on.
[130:11.34]Alright, let me get outside.
[130:12.96]Oh, I am like, it's a hundred degrees in here.
[130:27.89]Let me say hello to the new subs.
[130:33.33]Anthony is good, thanks for eight months.
[130:35.64]Don't blame the stream for pressing F. I didn't blame the stream.
[130:40.83]I blame my own stupidity.
[130:45.19]Thank you, Shifty Bloke.
[130:47.89]Shifty, thanks for the sub.
[130:53.22]Thank you very much.
[130:53.88]Yellow Helicopter for the bits.
[130:55.14]Thanks, dude.
[130:56.54]Hold on, Jerma.
[130:57.14]I'm almost there.
[130:57.84]Alright, where is... I want to do one more adversary mode.
[131:05.30]The first one I did was fucking hilarious.
[131:09.91]across the line.
[131:13.43]What?
[131:13.77]A team that gets all their plays across the other team's line wins.
[131:17.37]Didn't we just play this?
[131:19.71]We were just doing this on the cliff.
[131:25.71]What about this one?
[131:27.85]Another slipstream.
[131:29.53]That turned into chaos real quick.
[131:36.46]I guess I can just host a lobby, right?
[131:38.08]Whatever one is the funnest.
[131:43.17]I'll host one.
[131:45.59]Just invite a bunch of random people.
[131:47.97]What adversary mode is fun?
[131:56.94]Is this Rockstar created?
[131:59.42]Adversary mode.
[132:01.80]Beast versus Slasher.
[132:03.10]Beast versus Slasher 5.
[132:03.90]Slipstream.
[132:09.35]Come out to play.
[132:21.77]The Beast one was kind of fun.
[132:29.05]Entourage is okay.
[132:34.88]Slasher.
[132:35.34]Yeah, actually, Slasher was pretty fun.
[132:38.30]Which one did we do?
[132:40.22]I don't remember which one we actually did.
[132:44.56]Okay, we're going to the pier.
[132:56.09]Hey, assertive.
[132:57.23]Thanks for eight months, dude.
[132:59.17]Welcome back.
[133:01.65]Yes, I would like to host.
[133:12.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[133:13.06]Karen, first to win two rounds.
[133:14.36]Yeah, that looks okay.
[133:20.35]My friends.
[133:21.55]Friends playing GTA.
[133:22.31]Hey.
[133:24.94]And then auto invite.
[133:28.64]All.
[133:29.96]Whoever it can be.
[133:37.78]Yeah, sorry I can't add more people on the friends list.
[133:41.85]I gotta just open up the biaz if I play GTA again.
[133:46.41]Open the biaz up.
[133:51.11]Is this four to ten people?
[133:54.23]Hey Otto, what are you doing?
[133:56.45]What are you doing?
[133:59.35]What do you want some food?
[134:01.86]Are you hungry dog?
[134:08.36]I'll feed him in a minute.
[134:13.52]You want some meat?
[134:15.39]Yes.
[134:26.18]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[134:28.10]Ah, let's get like one or two more people in here.
[134:30.06]Uh-oh.
[134:33.90]Oh, no, it's just going?
[134:34.68]Okay.
[134:38.70]It's just gonna go.
[134:42.24]Who's gonna be the beast?
[134:49.20]Show your dog?
[134:52.40]Show your dog?
[134:55.80]What I would give to be Jerma's dog.
[135:00.52]Beast versus Assault.
[135:02.58]This one's a lot different.
[135:06.97]Should we have?
[135:08.95]The beast is back and this time it's got company.
[135:11.09]Only a ragtag team of slashers armed up.
[135:13.91]And armed to the teeth have hope of stopping them.
[135:16.79]Beasts have to collect all the checkpoints.
[135:18.37]Slashers have to take out the beasts.
[135:23.23]This guy's just slamming a bottle of wine.
[135:26.30]I feel like this should be only two beasts.
[135:29.87]But, you know, whatever.
[135:33.77]Whatever.
[135:39.81]You hate Otto, you won't even give him his own emote?
[135:44.95]I could.
[135:48.27]I could give him his own emote.
[135:50.37]Maybe, yeah.
[135:50.91]Alright.
[135:54.59]Oh, beast mode.
[135:55.79]I'm on the team beast.
[135:59.75]Use the beast powers?
[136:09.01]Holy shit.
[136:11.59]Okay.
[136:14.21]These guys have rocket launchers?
[136:21.10]Wow.
[136:26.81]You can run really fast.
[136:27.81]Just sprint at him.
[136:28.25]What are you going to do about this?
[136:35.91]What?
[136:37.23]Wow, I just got slapped.
[136:39.53]I just got slapped.
[136:41.20]I just exploded myself.
[136:48.12]I got one.
[136:49.64]I got a guy.
[136:51.60]Right?
[136:52.22]I took a guy out.
[136:56.03]Okay, this guy knows what he's doing.
[137:01.11]If I didn't take that guy out... Are you shitting me?
[137:08.84]This guy's like riding a rollercoaster right now.
[137:15.24]Where is this guy going?
[137:21.08]Is this hopping over shit?
[137:22.06]Oh, okay, they have like... Like three people now?
[137:24.85]Four people?
[137:27.73]Oh, he got taken out.
[137:30.29]No, he's dead, yeah.
[137:31.15]See you later.
[137:33.87]Some dude had a minigun.
[137:39.93]This guy knows what he's doing.
[137:40.83]The guy running in circles.
[137:44.51]Hey, happy Halloween, everybody.
[137:47.04]Happy Halloween.
[137:52.66]Well, at least I get to be on the other team now.
[137:56.28]Maybe I have the minigun.
[137:57.30]That'd be so cool.

[139:45.72]Oh, there's a wolf.
[139:49.78]He just disappeared.
[139:52.04]Whoa!
[139:58.92]What?
[139:59.16]That's invisibility.
[140:03.12]I forgot they even had that move.
[140:05.46]Wow.
[140:05.72]I thought I was lagging.
[140:17.36]I don't like this, it's too hard.
[140:21.28]Loser!
[140:21.68]Like a teen wolf just like came up behind me.

[140:36.53]Whole year.
[140:38.72]Can you believe a year has gone by?
[140:41.52]But thanks regardless.
[140:46.18]But I think that's going to be it for me.
[140:49.08]I have to feed my dog.
[140:52.48]And I had some things I had to do later anyways.
[140:57.50]New Internet comes in tomorrow.
[140:59.80]So I can go back to my normal time.
[141:01.44]7 p.m.
[141:04.14]Hopefully it works.
[141:08.04]I want to get like, you know, three to five hours in per stream.
[141:13.47]And I really am banking on the fact that buying brand new internet and having a new line put into the house will actually work.
[141:24.10]So we'll find out tomorrow.
[141:28.40]Time to get ready for the Tinder date.
[141:31.34]But yeah, thanks everybody for coming out.
[141:34.10]If anybody ends up coming around, if I'm not here in the next couple hours looking for the stream, just I guess let them know that I started like four hours earlier.
[141:47.03]But yeah, that's going to be it.
[141:48.85]Thanks, everybody.
[141:49.99]Much love.
[141:50.43]Thanks to all the new subs, all the bits.
[141:51.79]There was a lot of money dropped pretty early in this stream.
[141:54.99]So thanks for that.
[141:57.20]Much appreciated.
[141:58.60]Have a good rest of your day.
[141:59.24]Have a good rest of your night.
[142:00.50]And I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[142:02.56]Cross your fingers that my internet actually works when I want it to.
[142:07.07]So good night.
[142:07.93]Good luck.
[142:08.69]Goodbye.
